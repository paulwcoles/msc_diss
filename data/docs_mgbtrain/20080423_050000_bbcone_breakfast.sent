HELLO THIS IS BREAKFAST WITH SIAN 
WILLIAMS AND BILL TURNBULL THE 
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DIGITAL RIP OFF A B. B. C. 
INVESTIGATION SHOWS CYBER COST 
CRIME COULD BE COSTING MORE THAN 
OFFICIAL ESTIMATES 
GOOD MORNING TO YOU IT'S WEDNESDAY 
TWENTY THIRD APRIL ALSO AHEAD TODAY AHEAD 
ON POINTS IN PENNSYLVANIA BUT 
HILLARY FAILS TO LAND A KNOCKOUT 
BLOW ON BARACK OBAMA WHAT'S A 
TEACHERS' STRIKE MUM FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN A GENERATION 
THOUSANDS OF SCHOOL CHILDREN ARE 
ABOUT TO FIND OUT FOR A BOY EAT 
BREAKFAST SCIENTISTS SAY YOU ARE 
WHAT YOUR MOTHER ATE 
I WOULD BE 
AMAZED IF THAT WAS SO BUT SAYING 
THAT I EAT BREAKFAST AND I HAVE A 
LITTLE BOY 
IN THE WEATHER THERE WILL BE SOME 
RAIN BEFORE THE SUNSHINE COMES OUT 
AGAIN AGAIN AND IN THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE 
CHELSEA TAKE A PRECIOUS AWAY GOAL 
BACK TO THE BRIDGE 
IT WAS NOT EVEN IN THE LAST KICK 
IT WAS THE LAST TOUCH OF THE GAME 
MORNING FIRST OUR MAIN STORY THE 
FULL TOAST OF INTERNET CREDIT CARD 
FRAUD IS FAR HIGHER THAN OFFICIAL 
IAL FIGURES SUGGEST A B. B. C. 
INVESTIGATION SHOW FRAUDSTERS 
TRYING TO STEAL MILLIONS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
AND HOW EASY IT IS TO FIND DETAILS 
ON THE NET 
WHEN ADELE BOUGHT AN ELECTRIC PIANO 
FOR HER SON IT WAS NOT THE FIRST 
TIME SHE HAD BOUGHT ON LINE BUT 
THIS TIME HER CREDIT CARD HAD BEEN 
HACKED THE DETAILS WERE SHOWN 
REGARDING THE ON LINE RETAILER 
WHERE SHE BOUGHT THE PIANO AND 
THEN PASSED ON TO OTHERS 
THE FIRST 
SHOCK WAS REALISING I HAD HAD MY 
CREDIT CARD STOLEN IN A PHYSICAL 
SENSE LIKE BEING MUGGED L. DIDN'T 
THINK OF HACKERS 
MRS. DARLING'S 
MONEY WAS REFUNDED BY HER CREDIT 
CARD MONEY AS IN MOST CASES SO 
DOES THIS KIND OF CRIME REALLY 
MATTER WELL YES IT DOES BECAUSE 
THIS GETS PASSED ON TO RETAILERS 
AND THEN TO US THE CONSUMERS WHEN 
JOHN SOLLARS SET UP AN ON LINE 
BUSINESS THIRTY THOUSAND WORTH OF GOODS 
WERE STOLEN ON LINE AND HE NEARLY 
LOST HIS HOUSE TODAY FRAUDULENT 
ORDERS STILL FLOOD IN AND HE SAYS 
THE POLICE ARE JUST NOT INTERESTED 
TWO HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT IT IS CRIMINALITY GONE MAD 
BUT NO ONE IS INTERESTED IN IT WE WE FOUND MRS. DARLING'S DETAILS ON THE 
INTERNET WHERE SECURITY CODES WERE 
OPENLY BEING BOUGHT AND SOLD THIS 
CRIME HAS DOUBLED IN THE PAST THREE 
YEARS AND THE POLICE SAY THEY DON'T 
HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THE 
SCALE OF THE PROBLEM AND UNTIL THEY 
DO IT IS SMALL BUSINESSES THAT 
WILL BE COUNTING THE COST 
HILLARY CLINTON WON THE 
PENNSYLVANIA PRIMARY LAST NIGHT 
DEFEATING BARACK OBAMA IN A TOUGH 
RACE SENATOR CLINTON SAID THE TIDE 
WAS TURNING IN HER FAVOUR 
SHE ENTERED TO THE STRAINS OF THE 
SONG I WON'T BACK DOWN IT SAID 
IT ALL AND PENNSYLVANIA PROVIDED 
THE CLEAR CUT VICTORY THAT KEEPS 
HILLARY CLINTON'S HOPES ALIVE SOME SOME PEOPLE COUNTED ME OUT AND SAID TO 
DROP OUT BUT THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE PEOPLE WELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T 
QUIT AND THEY DESERVE A PRESIDENT 
WHO DOESN'T QUIT EITHER 
THE BOXING GLOVES BEHIND HER 
REINFORCE THE BITTER TONE OF THE 
CAMPAIGN CAMPAIGN BARACK OBAMA HAD ALREADY MOVED ON 
TO INDIANA THE NEXT ROUND OF THIS 
UNDECIDED FIGHT AT FIRST SOUNDING 
MAGNANIMOUS IN DEFEAT 
I WANT TO 
START TONIGHT BY CONGRATULATING 
SENATOR CLINTON ON HER VICTORY THIS 
EVENING AND I WANT TO THANK NO 
NO SHE RAN A TERRIFIC RACE AND AND AFTER THAT HOSTILE REACTION THERE 
FOLLOWED THIS SWIPE AT HIS RIVAL 
WE CAN USE FEAR AS A TACTIC THE 
THREAT OF TERRORISM TO SCARE UP 
VOTES OR WE CAN DECIDE THAT REAL 
STRENGTH IS ASKING THE TOUGH 
QUESTIONS BEFORE WE SEND OUR TROOPS 
IN TO FIGHT 
HILLARY CLINTON'S 
PERSEVERANCE THOUGH IS PAYING OFF 
SHE IS STILL THE UNDERDOG BUT THIS 
EMBRACE SUGGESTS THEY THINK THEY 
HAVE ACHIEVED A BREAKTHROUGH 
OUR CORRESPONDENT KATTY KAY IS AT 
HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN 
HEADQUARTERS IS THIS A CONVINCING 
WIN FOR HER DO YOU THINK 
ABSOLUTELY AS YOU CAN SEE THE 
CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS PACKED UP AND 
MOVED ON BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE THEY 
NEEDED TO WIN THIS STATE TO STAY IN 
THE RACE AND THEY DID THAT AND 
THEY NEEDED TO WIN CONVINCINGLY TO 
BE ABLE TO GO TO THE DEMOCRAT PARTY 
AND THE SUPERDELEGATES AND 
PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT GO TO THE 
FINANCIAL BACKERS AND SAY LOOK I 
CAN FIGHT AND WIN AND I CAN STAY IN 
THIS AND YOU SHOULD BACK ME YES YES BECAUSE BARACK OBAMA HAS MORE 
STATES AND VOTES AND CERTAINLY HAS 
MORE MONEY DO YOU SEE HILLARY 
CLINTON TURNING AROUND AT ANY STAGE 
AND HOLDING HER HANDS UP AND SAYING 
O. K. YOU'VE GOT IT 
I DON'T THINK 
SO BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES SHE HAS A 
CHANCE ALBEIT A SLIM CHANCE TO 
WIN SO SHE WILL START TALK AING 
ABOUT ELECTIBILITY SHE'LL SAY THAT 
BARACK OBAMA IN PENNSYLVANIA FAILED 
TO WIN AMONGST WOMEN AND POOR WHITE 
MEN THE SORT OF PEOPLE THEY NEED 
TO WIN OVER AGAINST JOHN MCCAIN 
SHE WILL GO TO THE DELEGATES TO SAY 
SHE CAN GET THOSE PEOPLE BEHIND HER 
THERE ARE MORE DETAILS ON THE B. B. C. 
WEBSITE 
POLICE IN REDDITCH WILL CONTINUE 
THEIR CERTAIN TODAY FOR DISABLED 
MAN WHO IS DESCRIBED AS EXTREMELY 
VULNERABLE JAMES HUGHES WHO IS TWENTY TWO 
HAS THE MENTAL AGE OF AN EIGHTEEN MONTH 
OLD CHILD HE AND HIS MOTHER 
HEATHER WERE REPORTED MISSING ON 
SATURDAY AND HEATHER WAS FOUND DEAD 
TWO DAYS LATER 
A CHARITY WANTS ALL SCHOOL CHILDREN 
TO TAKE A COURSE ON HEALTH AND 
SAFETY AT WORK AS PART OF THE 
NATIONAL CLICK CRUMB AND 
CURRICULUM AND THOUSANDS OF 
YOUNGSTERS ARE INJURED AT WORK 
EVERY YEAR 
THOUSANDS OF TEACHERS WILL STRIKE 
TOMORROW BUT IN SOME SCHOOLS ONLY 
CERTAIN CLASSES WILL BE CLOSED IT 
WILL BE THE FIRST NATIONAL STRIKE 
BY TEACHERS FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS SINCE THE 
NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE NATIONAL UNION OF 
TEACHERS ACCEPTS THAT THEIR PAY HAS 
IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THEN 
BUT SAY THAT THE CURRENT PAY OFFER 
IS BELOW INFLATION AND WILL ERODE 
THEIR GAINS 
IT IS TRUE THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT DID PUT SOME MONEY INTO 
TEACHERS' PAY EARLIER ON BUT AT 
THREE YEARS OF BELOW INFLATION PAY 
NOW THAT IS BEGINNING TO ERODE 
A SURVEY OF HALF OF ALL LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES SUGGESTS THE STRIKE 
WILL CAUSE MAJOR DISPRESUMPTION 
THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DISRUPTION OVER THREE ZERO FOUR HUNDRED 
SCHOOLS ARE SAYING THEY WILL CLOSE 
THE VAST MAJORITY OF TEACHERS SAY 
THEY DON'T WANT TO STRIKE AND EVEN 
IN THE NUT THE VAST MAJORITY SAID 
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO STRIKE AND I 
THINK ACROSS THE COUNTRY PARENTS 
WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IF THEIR 
CHILDREN'S EDUCATION IS DISRUPTED 
THE STRIKE IS NOT BACKED BY OTHER 
TEACHING UNIONS BUT THE NUT SAYS 
IF IT IS SUCCESSFUL THEY MAY 
CONSIDER A PROGRAMME OF ROLLING 
DISRUPTION LEADING TO A SUMMER OF 
DISCONTENT IN SCHOOLS RESCUE 
WORKERS ARE SEARCHING FOR A ROMAN 
CATHOLIC PRIEST WHO HAS GONE 
MISSING OFF THE COAST OF SOUTHERN 
BRAZIL HE TOOK OFF ATTACHED TO 
THOUSANDS OF HELIUM FILLED BALLOONS 
AND IS EQUIPPED WITH G. P. S. TRACKING 
DEVICE AND MOBILE PHONE BUT HAS 
NOT BEEN SEEN FOR THREE DAYS A 
BUILDER WHO IS OWED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND BY A 
CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN DRASTIC ACTION 
AND DEMOLISHED THE WORK HE Z. 
IT NOW LOOKS LIKE A PILE OF RUBBLE 
THE BUILDER SAID HE HAD REACHED THE 
END OF HIS TETHER WHEN THE 
DEADLINES FOR PAYMENT WERE MISSED 
ENGLISH HERITAGE ARE ENCOURAGING 
PEOPLE TO CELEBRATE SAINT GEORGE'S DAY 
TODAY SAYING THAT MORE PEOPLE 
CELEBRATE SAINT PATRICK'S DAY OR EVEN 
BONFIRE NIGHT WOMEN WHO CONSUME 
MORE CALORIES OR CEREALS CAN 
DETERMINE WHETHER THEY HAVE A BOY 
WHETHER YOUR BABY IS A BOY OR 
GIRL IS MOSTLY DOWN TO CHANCE BUT 
A NEW STUDY FOUND A LINK WITH A 
MUM'S DIET NOT DURING PREGNANCY 
BUT AROUND THE TIME SHE CONCEIVED 
THOSE WHO ATE MORE AND HAD A 
HEALTHIER DIET HAD SLIGHTLY MORE 
BOYS AND ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ATE 
CEREAL FOR BREAKFAST MOST PARENTS 
ARE HAPPY TO HAVE A HEALTHY BABY 
WHATEVER THE SEX BUT IF THEY DO 
HAVE SLIGHT PREFERENCE ONE WAY OR 
THE OTHER THEN DIET COULD 
INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME WHAT DO 
THESE MUMS MAKE OF IT 
I CAN'T 
REALLY REMEMBER BUT I SEEM TO 
REMEMBER EATING QUITE A LOT AT THE 
TIME AND I LIKE CEREALS SO THAT 
WOULD INDICATE A BOY BUT SHE IS A 
GIRL 
I DID EAT BREAKFAST AND HAVE GIRL A BOY SO IT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE 
FOR ME 
SCIENTISTS SAY THAT COULD 
EXPLAIN WHY BIRTHS OF BOYS ARE 
LOWER IN SOME COUNTRIES 
OVER THE 
YEARS YOUNG WOMEN IN PARTICULAR 
ARE DECREASING THEIR INTAKE OF 
CALORIES AND POSSIBLY SKIPPING 
BREAKFAST BUT OUR RESEARCH 
CONCLUDES THAT REGULAR EATING AND A 
HEALTHY BREAKFAST SEEMS TO BE 
RELATED TO HAVING BOYS 
MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT MUM'S 
HEALTHY DIET IS PARAMOUNT AND NOT 
NECESSARY IN CHOOSING THE SEX OF 
THE BABY WELL SIAN YOU HAVE 
THREE BOYS 
YES AND I EAT 
BREAKFAST AND A LOT 
YOU EAT 
SEAWEED 
THAT WAS TEN YEARS AGO SEAWEED I'VE CHANGED SINCE THEN 
LET US KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE 
EXPERIENCED IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE 
BOYS BECAUSE YOU EAT A LOT OF 
CEREAL LET US KNOW 
I BET CHRIS'S MOTHER ATE A LOT OF 
CEREALS 
SHE DOES THAT'S WHY I CEREALS HAVE BIG FAT KNEES AND TALKING OF 
THAT SEAWEED I'M SO GLAD YOU 
STOPPED IT 
STKPWHROOFPBGZ AFTER THE FIRST LEG 
OF THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE SEMI FINAL 
IT'S CHELSEA BY HEAD 
DESPITE LIVERPOOL TAKING THE LEAD 
SHORTLY BEFORE HALF TIME AN OWN 
GOAL BY JOHN ARNE RIISE IN THE LAST 
SECONDS OF THE MATCH GIVES CHELSEA 
THE ADVANTAGE WITH A CRUCIAL AWAY 
GOAL GOAL IT MEANS LIVERPOOL HAVE TO SCORE IN 
THE SECOND LEG AT STAMFORD BRIDGE 
AWAITING THE EVENTUAL WINNERS OF 
THAT MATCH WILL BE EITHER 
MANCHESTER UNITED OR BARCELONA 
THEY MEET IN THEIR SEMI FINAL FIRST 
LEG AT THE NOU CAMP THIS EVENING 
ANDY MURRAY MARCHES ON 
HE WON HIS SECOND MATCH IN AS MANY 
DAYS TO DEFEAT ITALY'S FILLIPPO 
VOLANDRI IN STRAIGHT SETS AT THE 
MONTE CARLO MASTERS BUT HE'LL FACE 
NOVAK DJOKOVIC NEXT 
AND HOME IS THE HERO JOE CALZAGHE 
RETURNS TO WALES AFTER HIS WIN OVER 
BERNARD HOPKINS IN LAS VEGAS 
AND HE SAYS THAT JUST ONE MORE 
SUPER FIGHT MIGHT NOT QUITE ENOUGH 
AND A LOOK AT THE PAPERS 
THE SUN SAYS ARNEY AGONY A NINETY 
MINUTE GOAL STUNS THE KOP AND YOU 
MAY NOT HAVE HEARD OF THIS PERSON 
ROBERT DEE TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD TENNIS 
PLAYER FROM BEXLEY WHO HAS EARNED 
THE REPUTATION OF BEING THE WORST 
PLAYER WHY BECAUSE HE LOST FIFTY FOUR 
MATCHES ON THE PROFESSIONAL CIRCUIT 
WITHOUT WINNING A SET BUT THE 
GREAT NEWS HIS FIFTY FIFTH MATCH HE WON 
A SET SO WELL DONE TO HIM KEEP 
PERSEVEREING AND THEY SAY HE JUST 
HAD A BAD RUN SADLY HE LOST THE 
NEXT ROUND BUT COME ON

NOTE AS YOU SAW THERE WITH ALISON 
AND MOST OF US WILL SEE RAIN FOR A 
TIME PARTICULARLY DURING THIS 
MORNING IT IS GOING TO BE A MILD 
DAY WE HAVE THE AIR COMING OFF THE 
ATLANTIC ATLANTIC BUT AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE SATELLITE 
PICTURE THERE IS THAT NARROW STRIP 
OF WHITE AN AREA OF CLOUD ACROSS 
THE U. K. FROM WHICH WE HAVE RAIN 
FALLING THROUGH BREAKFAST WE HAVE 
SEEN THE RAIN PUSH IN TOWARDS 
WESTERN SCOTLAND NORTH WEST 
ENGLAND THE MIDLANDS AND THE SOUTH 
EAST EDGING TOWARDS THE LONDON AND 
SOUTH EAST AREA BY EIGHT HUNDRED A M. OR NINE A M. 
IT WILL CLEAR AWAY THE MIST AND FOG 
WE HAVE ACROSS EASTERN PARTS OF 
ENGLAND TOWARDS THE FAR EASTERN 
COSTS IT WILL BE CLOUDY AND DAMP BY 
THE END OF THIS AFTERNOON 
BRIGHTENING SKIES TO THE WEST OF 
LONDON FROM HAMPSHIRE UP TO EIGHTEEN 
CELSIUS SEVENTEEN CELSIUS ACROSS THE 
MIDLANDS AND THE LOVELY BRIGHT 
AFTERNOON ACROSS THE NORTH WEST 
THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND STILL 
GOT THE CLOUD STILL RAIN POSSIBLE

TEMPERATURES IN GLASGOW UP TO THIRTEEN 
CELSIUS A LOVELY SIXTEEN CELSIUS IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND 
DRY AND SUNNY DAY TO COME HERE THE 
RAIN HAS JUST ABOUT CLEARED AND IT 
SHOULD STAY FINE THE RISK OF ONE 
OR TWO SHOWERS AS THERE COULD BE 
ACROSS WALES AND THE SOUTH WEST 
FROM MID MORNING ONWARDS MUCH OF 
WALES AND THE SOUTH WEST WILL BE 
DRY AND BRIGHT WITH SUNSHINE 
THROUGH THIS COMING EVENING WE LOSE 
THE RAIN FROM THE EASTERN PARTS OF

PARTICULARLY FOR THE NORTH SEA 
COASTS LIKE LAST NIGHT WE START TO 
SEE RAIN PUSH IN ACROSS NORTHERN 
IRELAND WALES AND THE SOUTH WEST 
OF ENGLAND BEFORE THE NIGHT IS 
THROUGHMENT FOR ALL OF US IT WILL 
BE A MILD ONE TOMORROW A SIMILAR 
DAY TO TODAY 
BRIGHT START ACROSS SOME EASTERN 
AREAS BUT THE RAIN WILL PUSH IN 
THE SKIES BRIGHTENING TOWARDS THE 
WEST LATER ON AND THERE WILL BE A 
FEW SHOWERS AND IT WILL BE COOLER 
THAN TODAY 
WHICH WOULD YOU PREFER TO DO A 
THREE MILE RUN OR SPEND AN HOUR 
DIGGING THE GARDEN IF 
THE 
PAVEMENT OR SWEATING IT OUT IN THE 
GYM IS NOT YOUR THING THERE IS AN 
ALTERNATIVE IT INVOLVES FRESH AIR 
AND WELLIES AND GARDENING GLOVES 
AND A SPADE 
ALISON HARPER HAS GOT IT IN 
EASTLEIGH EASTLEIGH LOOK SCLAMT 
LOOK LOOK WE ARE ONE OF THE FATTEST NATIONS 
IN EUROPE OBESITY LEVELS ARE 
INCREASING AND IT IS HARD SOMETIMES 
TO GET THE ENERGY TO KEEP FIT 
DID YOU KNOW THAT DIGGING FOR AN 
HOUR BURNS UP ABOUT THE SIMILAR 
NUMBER OF CALORIES AS WORKING ON AN 
EXERCISE BIKE L. KNOW WHICH I WOULD PREFER PREFER THESE GUYS ARE WARMING UP FOR THEIR 
DAILY WORKOUT AND AT LEAST THEY 
WILL BE PUTTING THEIR ENERGY TO 
GOOD USE 
HIDDEN AWAY IN AN OXFORDSHIRE GLADE 
A DIFFERENT KIND OF FITNESS REGIME 
WHERE DUMBBELLS ARE REPLACED BY 
SAWS THIS IS GREEN GYM WAY TO 
GET FIT OUTDOORS 
IN THE PAST G. P.'S ANSWER TO GETTING 
FIT IS ABOUT GO TO THE GYM BUT SO 
MANY PEOPLE HATE THE GYM OR HATE 
THE COMMON METHODS OF GETTING FIT 
AND SLOWLY THEY ARE REALISING AND 
THE GOVERNMENT IS REALISING THAT 
THIS IS AN IDEAL ALTERNATIVE 
HERE IN OXFORDSHIRE TODAY'S WORK 
AREOUT IS RESTORING A WATER MEADOW 
TO ITS FORMER GLORY 
I'M JUST A MUSICIAN I'M NOT 
EXPERIENCED IN THIS SORT OF THING 
AT ALL 
I COME TO LIVE NEAR THE WATER 
MEADOWS AND IT IS FASCINATING TO 
HELP CLEAR THEM AND MAKE THEM 
USABLE BY CATTLE AND WILDLIFE AND 
SO ON 
IT ACTUALLY BURNS CALORIES SO HERE 
I AM GETTING MORE BEAUTIFUL BY THE 
MINUTE MINUTE THERE ARE ALMOST ONE HUNDRED GREEN GYMS 
SET UP ACROSS THE U. K. SUPPORTED BY 
VOLUNTEERS AND WHO WOULD HAVE 
THOUGHT THAT A SIMPLE IDEA FROM AN 
OXFORDSHIRE G. P. WOULD PROVE SO 
POPULAR THAT GREEN GYMS ARE 
SPRINGING UP AS FAR AFIELD AS 
AUSTRALIA AUSTRALIA THE WEEKLY WORKOUTS ARE ALL 
DIFFERENT ONE WEEK IT WILL BE 
CLEARING WOOD THE NEXT BUILDING 
FENCESMENT AND THERE ARE NO 
SHORTAGE OF PROJECTS 
JUST BEING OUTSIDE ON A LOVELY DAY 
LIKE THIS IS FANTASTIC AND THE 
SATISFACTION OF SEEING THE FENCE 
REPAIRED AND SEEING THE COWS IN THE 
FIELD AND SEEING THE WATER START TO 
RUN IT IS FANTASTIC FOR THE 
VOLUNTEERS THEY LOVE IT THEY 
ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT 
AFTER A MORNING'S HARD SLOG THE 
PERFECT WAY TO END A WORK OUT TEA 
AND BISCUITS 
NOW THIS IS ONE OF THE NEWEST GREEN 
GYMS IN THE U. K. THIS IS IN 
EASTLEIGH EASTLEIGH WE ARE COVERING THIS AREA WITH A 
WILDLIFE GARDEN IT WILL ATTRACT 
LOTS OF ANIMALS AND INSECTS AND WE 
ARE PLANTING FOXGLOVES SAY WE 
THAT SOUNDS GREAT AND I HAVEN'T 
USED MY SPADE YET THIS WILL BE 
TURNED OVER AND IT WILL LOOK 
DIFFERENT IN FEW WEEKS IF YOU 
ARE NOT SURE IF THIS IS GOOD FOR 
THE ENVIRONMENT AND YOUR BODY 
DIGGING AND WEEDING CAN BURN FOUR HUNDRED 
CALORIES AN HOUR AND AT LEAST YOU 
ARE PUTTING ENERGY INTO SOMETHING 
WORTHWHILE WORTHWHILE BACK TO YOU I'M GOING TO START 
DIGGING DIGGING I THINK THE DIGGING WILL 
USE UP MORE THAN THE WEEDING AND 
THE TROU WELLING 
YOU KNOW AS SOON AS WE TAKE THE 
CAMERA OFF ALISON SHE WILL DROP 
THE SPADE 
LEAVE ME ALONE IS WHAT SHE IS 
SAYING THIS IS A STORY THAT COULD 
LEAVE ELVIS FANS ALL SHOOK UP 
A STORY SURFACED THAT CONTRARY TO 
POPULAR BELIEF ELVIS PRESLEY DID 
SET FOOT ON BRITISH SOIL AND FOR 
MORE THAN A SHORT STOPOVER HE 
SPENT THE DAY WITH TOMMY STEELE 
THAT'S THE CLAIM BY THE THEATRE 
PRODUCER BILL KEN KENWRIGHT 
ELVIS CAME TO ENGLAND NOBODY 
THINKS HE DID 
REALLY 
I HOPE 
TOMMY DOESN'T GO MAD REALLY TOMMY WORKS FOR ME AND TOMMY GOT A 
PHONE CALL ONE NIGHT THEY TOLD ME 
YOU'RE GOOD WHO IS THIS HE 
SAID ARE YOU AS GOOD AS ME THEY 
GOT A FRIENDSHIP AND ELVIS FLEW IN 
FOR A DAY AND TOMMY SHOWED HIM 
AROUND LONDON WHEN HE WAS OVER IN 
THE FORCES AND PUT HIM BACK ON A 
PLANE AND THEY SPENT A DAY TOGETHER 
I DON'T BELIEVE IT 
ELVIS STOPPED OVER HE HE IT WOULD 
HAVE DRIFTED ELVIS STOPPED OVER 
ONCE IN PRESTWICK AND THAT WAS THE 
ONLY TIME THAT HE DID TOMMY STEELE 
TOLD BILL KENWRIGHT AND NOBODY 
ELSE ELSE IT DOESN'T ADD UP TO YOU

MINUTE HEART BREAK FOR THEM 
IT WASN'T A GREAT SPECTACLE BUT 
AFTER NINETY MINUTES THE TIE BETWEEN 
LIVERPOOL AND CHELSEA IS STILL 
BEAUTIFULLY BALANCED 
IT FINISHED ONE TO ONE BUT CHELSEA WILL 
HAVE THE SLIGHT PSYCHOLOGICAL 
ADVANTAGE WITH THAT AWAY GOAL 
THANKS TO A LATE EQUALISER 
IT PROMISED TO BE ANOTHER THRILLING 
NIGHT AT ANFIELD EVEN LIVERPOOL'S 
CONTROVERSIAL CO OWNER TOM HICKS 
WAS IN GOOD VOICE WELL SORT OF 
AND THE HOME FANS HAD PLENTY TO 
SING ABOUT WHEN DIRK KUYT SQUIRMED 
FREE IN THE FORTY THIRD MINUTE TO FIRE 
LIVERPOOL IN FRONT 
CHELSEA HAD PLENTY OF POSSESSION 
BUT MADE FEW CHANCES AND IT TOOK A 
COUPLE OF EXCELLENT SAVES FROM PETR 
CECH TO PREVENT LIVERPOOL FROM 
ADDING TO THEIR SCORE 
BUT IN THE FIFTH MINUTE OF EXTRA 
TIME THE TIE WAS TURNED ON IT'S 
HEAD HEAD SALOMAN KALOU'S CROSS WAS TURNED 
INTO HIS OWN NET BY JOHN ARNE RIISE 
THAT CRUCIAL AWAY GOAL MEANS THAT 
LIVERPOOL MUST NOW SCORE AT 
STAMFORD BRIDGE IN THE SECOND LEG 
A FEAT THEY HAVEN'T ACHIEVED IN 
EIGHT ATTEMPTS 
WE HAD THREE CLEAR CHANCES SO IT 
IS DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE YOU NEED 
TO TAKE YOUR CHANCES YOU CAN SEE 
THE BALL AT THE END AND WE'RE 
DISAPPOINTED BUT WE NEED TO GO TO 
STAMFORD BRIDGE PREPARED FOR THIS 
GAME AND WE HAVE NINETY MINUTES AND WE 
HAVE OUR CHANCES AS TODAY WE'LL 
TAKE OUR CHANCES WE KNOW IT WILL 
BE DIFFICULT BUT WE HAVE ENOUGH 
CONFIDENCE IN OURSELVES 
WE WANT TO 
BE IN THE FINAL L. THINK WE MADE A 
BIG STEP TO DO AND TODAY AND WE 
CAN USE IT IT IS A TARGET OF 
CHELSEA TO BE IN THE FINAL OF THE 
CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE 
IT'S MANCHESTER UNITED'S TURN 
TONIGHT TONIGHT THEY'RE AT THE NOU CAMP FOR THE 
FIRST LEG OF THE SEMI FINAL AGAINST 
BARCELONA BARCELONA THESE TWO SIDES LAST MET IN THE 
COMPETITION IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE THE YEAR 
UNITED WON THE TROPHY 
THAT YEAR THE TWO SIDES PLAYED OUT 
A COUPLE OF SPECTACULAR THREE TO THREE DRAWS 
SIR ALEX FERGUSON DOESN'T HAVE ANY 
MAJOR INJURY WORRIES BUT HE HOPES 
HIS SIDE CAN IMPROVE ON LAST SEASON 
WHEN THEY WENT OUT OF THE 
COMPETITION AT THIS STAGE 
I THINK WE'RE IN A MUCH STRONGER 
POSITION THIS YEAR IN TERMS OF THE 
ABILITY OF THE TEAM LAST YEAR WE 
WERE REALLY PUTTING IN THE SAME 
PLAYERS ALL THE TIME SO HOPEFULLY 
THAT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO US 
AND I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IS 
TO ENJOY TOMORROW AND THIS WE 
INTEND TO DO 
BARCA COULD BE WITHOUT THIERRY 
HENRY IN ATTACK 
THE FORMER ARSENAL MAN MISSED 
TRAINING ON MONDAY WITH FEVER 
RONALDIHNO AND LILIAN THURAM HAVE 
ALSO MISSED TRAINING SO MAY BE 
DOUBTS DOUBTS AND THEY'LL BE WITHOUT THEIR 
SKIPPER CARLOS PUYOL WHO'S ABSENT 
THROUGH SUSPENSION ONE MORE PIECE 
OF FOOTBALL NEWS AFTER EIGHTY SEVEN YEARS

AT THE MONTE CARLO MASTERS HE 
PULLED OFF A STRAIGHT SETS WIN HIS 
SECOND ROUND MATCH IT WASN'T

DISPLAY FROM THE BRITISH NUMBER ONE

SERVE TO TAKE THE FIRST SET 
VOLANDRI THEN FELL APART IN THE 
SECOND AS MURRAY WON IT SIX TO FOUR SIX TO ONE

AND THE HERO IS BACK HOME JOE 
CALZAGHE FLEW IN FROM LAS VEGAS 
YESTERDAY TO BE GREETED BY FANS AT 
GATWICK AIRPORT AFTER FAMOUS 
VICTORY OVER BERNARD HOPKINS AT THE 
WEEKEND ALL THE TALK IS ABOUT WHAT 
JOE DOES NEXT THAT POSSIBLE FIGHT 
WITH ROY JONES JUNIOR IS STILL ON 
THE HORIZON ALTHOUGH ONE FIGHT MAY 
NOT BE ENOUGH FOR THE WELSH WARRIOR 
I KNOW YOU'VE SAID ONE 
MORE FIGHT BUT THE TEMPTATION 
COULD BE TO GO ON A BIT LONGER 
WE'LL SEE I'M JUST GOING TO ENJOY 
THIS WIN AT THE MOMENT AND GO HOME 
AND WEIGH UP MY OPTIONS IT WAS 
FANTASTIC THANKS TO ALL THE FANS 
WHO CAME OUT TO SUPPORT ME 
THAT WAS JOE CALZAGHE TALKING TO 
OUR JOE YESTERDAY BUT WE WERE 
SAYING YESTERDAY WHY ONE MORE 
FIGHT AND THEN IT COULD GO ON AND 
ON ON DID YOU SEE IT WAS RATHER SWEET 
HE HAD THAT TINY LITTLE PLASTER ON 
HIS KNOWS NOSE 
YES IT WAS A HARD 
FIGHT 
BEFORE YOU COME BACK NEXT FIGHT TIME CAN YOU SORT OUT SIR ALEX'S 
COLLAR 
I'LL TRY MY BEST COLLAR MANY TEACHERS ACROSS ENGLAND AND 
WALES WILL BE ON STRIKE TOMORROW 
THOUSANDS OF SCHOOLS WILL BE CLOSED 
AND MANY OTHERS DISRUPTED TIM MUFF 
YACHT OUR REPORTER JOINS US FROM 
GEORGE STREEN SCHOOL WHERE SOME OF 
THE TEACHERS WILL BE ON STRIKE 
DIVSHGSH GEORGE GREEN SCHOOL 
IT HAS THE NUT ON STRIKE WHICH HAS 
THE GREATER NUMBER OF MEMBERS 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY FROM THE LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES WE'VE CONTACTED IT 
SEEMS THAT AT LEAST THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY SIX SCHOOLS 
WILL BE CLOSED THAT'S THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT OF THE 
TOTAL AND THAT FIGURE COULD RISE 
BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS 
UNTIL THE STRIKE HAPPENS HOW WIDE 
SPREAD IT WILL BE THIS SCHOOL WILL 
CERTAINLY BE CLOSED LET'S CHAT TO 
THE HEAD TEACHER 
HELLO FIVE HUNDRED SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE 
WHAT PROVISIONS ARE YOU MAKING FOR 
TOMORROW WELL THE SCHOOL WILL BE 
CLOSED BECAUSE SOMETHING LIKE SIXTY 
MEMBERS OF MY TEACHING STAFF WILL 
BE ON STRIKE SO I'M GOING TO CLOSE 
THE SCHOOL L. THINK THAT IS THE 
BEST OPTION 
ARE YOU MAKING ANY 
PROVISION FOR CHILDREN OR PARENTS 
AT ALL 
NO I CAN'T MAKE PROVISION 
FOR THAT THAT THE SOMETHING 
PARENTS WILL HAVE TO DO WE WERE 
ABLE TO WARN PARENTS BEFORE THE 
HOLIDAYS IT WAS LIKELY TO HAPPEN 
AND AGAIN WARNED THEM ON MONDAY SO 
IN THE SAME WAY FOR TRAINING DAYS 
THEY'LL HAVE TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS 
THEMSELVES 
AS FAR AS THE TIMING OF THEMSELVES THIS STRIKE GOES THERE HAS BEEN 
CRITICISM BECAUSE EXAM TIME IS NOT 
FAR AWAY WAY WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ON 
THAT 
THERE IS NO GOOD TIME FOR A THAT STRIKE IT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT 
PARTICULARLY WORKING WITH CHILDREN 
AND EVERY DAY IS IMPORTANT TO THEM 
BUT HAVING TEACHERS WHO ARE WELL 
PAID AND REWARDED FOR THE FANTASTIC 
JOB THEY DO IS REALLY IMPORTANT 
AND I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS 
THAT THE PAY ON OFFER IS NOT FOR 
ONE YEAR IT IS FOR A NUMBER OF 
YEARS I WANT TO KEEP MY TEACHERS 
TRAIN AND DEVELOP THEM FOR A LONG 
PERIOD OF TIME AND TRAIN AND DOX 
THEM AND I DON'T THINK PEOPLE 
UNDERSTAND WHAT A TEACHER DOES 
UNTIL THEY ACTUALLY DO IT EVEN EVEN THOUGH SOME UNIONS ARE NOT GOING ON 
STRIKE 
WELL DIFFERENT UNIONS ARE STRIKE DIFFERENT AND THE WORD 
INDEPENDENT IS SOMETHING I WOULD 
QUESTIONERRY BUT THE PAY OFFER IS 
NOT ENOUGH AND DOES NOT REWARD MY 
TEACHERS FOR THE WORK THAT THEY DO 
AND WHAT IS THE REACTION OF PARENTS 
SO FAR 
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO ANY 
PARENTS SO FAR BUT THEY RESPECT 
TEACHERS AND UNDERSTAND THE JOB 
THEY DO AND LIKE EVERYONE ELSE 
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY DESERVE A 
GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE 
THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH AND I HOPE IT WORKS OUT 
FOR THE BEST EVENTUALLY THIS 
STRIKE IS SET TO BE WIDE SPREAD 
BUT IT WILL CERTAINLY IMPACT A LOT 
OF PEOPLE ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TEXTING ABOUT IT 
THEY HAVE MARY IN CANTERBURY SAYS 
SHE WILL BE OUT WITH HER COLLEAGUES

WILL CELEBRATE IT LET'S TALK ABOUT GOOD NEWS FOR 
HOME OWNERS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT 
SAYS THERE WILL BE ENOUGH SUPPORT 
TO MAKE SURE THEIR HOMES OR 
PEOPLE'S HOMES AREN'T REPOSSESSED 
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT COMING AFTER 
YESTERDAY'S MEETING BETWEEN 
MORTGAGE LENDERS AND THE CHANCELLOR 
ALISTAIR DARLING BUT IT HAS HAS TO 
BE SAID NO DETAILS GIVEN AS TO THE 
PLANS OF HOW THE GOVERNMENT IS 
GOING TO AVERT THE REPOSSESSIONS 
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND OUT MORE 
DETAILS MICHAEL COGAN IS FROM THE 
COUNCIL OF MORTGAGE LENDERS AND YOU 
WERE AT THE MEETING YESTERDAY THE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS THERE WILL BE 
SUPPORT OUT THERE WHAT TYPE OF 
SUPPORT WILL BE THERE 
FOR EXISTING 
CUST CUSTOMERS THE KEY MESSAGE WE 
GAVE TO THE GOVERNMENT PEOPLE 
COMING OUT OF FIXED RATES LAST YEAR 
WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE FIGURES THAT 
THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE THEIR 
PAYMENT SHOCK THAT'S A POSITIVE 
SIGN SIGN AS THE REST OF THE YEAR GOES 
FORWARD THE THE FOURTEEN MILLION WILL 
HAVE LESS PAYMENT SHOCK THAN THOSE 
LAST YEAR 
THE HOUSING MINISTER SAID THAT THEY 
WANTED TO ENSURE STABILITY 
STABILITY AND FAIRNESS AND YOUR 
ORGANISATION AGREED A LOT OF 
PEOPLE WILL SAY THIS IS NOT FAIR 
YOU REPRESENT THESE LENDERS THESE 
LENDERS AREN'T PASSING ON LOWER 
INTEREST RATESMENT 
IF I DEAL WITH THE EXISTING

A CUSTOMER FACING DIFFICULTY THEY 
SHOULD SPEAK TO THE LENDER EARLY 
THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE IN YOUR 
TREATMENT IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM IF 
YOU WON'T PAY YOUR TREATMENT WILL 
BE DIFFERENT 
FOR NEW CUSTOMERS WE HAVE LACK OF 
FUNDING THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
FACILITY WILL BE A BIG HELP BUT IT 
WON'T COME THROUGH QUICKLY IN THE 
SHORT TERM WE ARE FACING HIGHER 
MORTGAGE COSTS BECAUSE COSTS OF 
FUNDS IS HIGH

THE FOURTEEN MILLION PEOPLE OUT THERE 
COMING OFF THE SHORT TERM FIXED 
RATES THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERN 
THERE BUT WHEN ARE WE GOING TO SEE 
MORE MORTGAGE PRODUCTS THE FIGURE 
DIPPED DEBLOW FOUR THOUSAND 
THE REAL 
PROBLEM IS MANY OF THE PRODUCTS 
AVAILABLE AND THE FOCUS FOR 
COMPETITION IS AROUND REFINANCE 
CUSTOMERS THE PEOPLE BEING 
SQUEEZED ARE HOUSE PURCHASERS AND 
FIRST TIME BUYERS THE WAY TO 
ADDRESS THAT IS MORE MONEY COMING 
INTO THE MARKET AS FUNDS 
DISTRIBUTED BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
ARE RECYCLED AND WE ARE FACING HIGH 
COSTS OF FUNDS AND THAT WILL BE 
PASSED ON IN MORTGAGE COSTS PEOPLE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO THINK THEY WILL BE IN 
TROUBLE PAYING ONE OR TWO PAYMENTS

THE MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING THE 
FULL COST OF INTERNET CREDIT CARD 
FRAUD IS FAR WORSE THAN OFFICIAL 
FIGURES SUGGEST A THREE MONTH 
INVESTIGATION BY THE B. B. C. REVEALED 
THAT INTERNET FRAUDSTERS TRIED TO 
STEAL ZERO POINT FIVE BILLION IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND THEY 
DISCOVERED HOW EASY IT IS TO FIND 
CARD DETAILS ON THE NET WHEN ADELE 
DARLING BOUGHT AN ELECTRIC PIANO 
FOR HER SON IT WAS NOT THE FIRST 
TIME SHE HAD SHOPPED ON LINE FOR 
HER SON BUT THIS TIME HER CREDIT 
CARD HAD BEEN HACKED 
WHEN THE 
STATEMENT CAME IT SHOWED THE 
TRANSACTION IN INDIA 
THE DETAILS 
HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM THE ON LINE 
RETAILER WHERE SHE HAD BOUGHT THE 
PIANO AND THEN SOLD ON TO THE 
FRAUDSTERS 
I THINK THE FIRST SHOCK FRAUDSTERS WHEN HAVING THE CREDIT CARD STOLEN 
IT WAS LIKE A PHYSICAL THING LIKE 
BEING MUGGED OR YOUR HANDBAG STOLEN 
I DIDN'T THINK OF HACKERS MRS. MRS DARLING'S MONEY WAS REFUNDED BY HER 
CREDIT CARD COMPANY AS IN MOST 
CASES SO DOES THIS KIND OF CRIME 
REALLY MATTER WELL YES IT DOES 
BECAUSE THIS GETS PASSED ON TO 
RETAILERS AND THEN TO US THE 
CONSUMERS CONSUMERS WHEN JOHN SOLLARS STARTED UP AN 
INTERNET BUSINESS HE LOST THIRTY THOUSAND 
WORTH OF GOODS AND NEARLY LOST HIS 
HOUSE 
THAT'S TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT WORTH TODAY HOUSE TODAY FRAUDULENT ORDERS STILL FLOOD IN 
AND HE SAYS THE POLICE ARE JUST NOT 
INTERESTED 
IT'S CRIMINALITY GONE INTERESTED MAD BUT NOBODY IS INTERESTED IN IT 
WE FOUND MRS. DARLING'S DETAILS ON 
WEBSITE WHERE THOUSANDS OF STOLEN 
CREDIT CARDS ADDRESSES SECURITY 
CODES AND DATES OF BIRTH WERE 
OPENLY BEING BOUGHT AND SOLD THE 
POLICE SAY THEY DON'T HAVE THE 
RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THE SCALE OF 
THE PROBLEM AND UNTIL THEY DO IT IS 
SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WILL BE 
COUNTING THE COST 
SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON WON THE 
PENNSYLVANIA PRIMARY LAST NIGHT 
DEFEATING BARACK OBAMA IN A TOUGH 
RACE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND HILLARY 
CLINTON SAID THE TIDE WAS TURNING 
IN HER FAVOUR JOINING US FROM 
WASHINGTON IS JONATHAN BEALE WAS 
IT CONVINCING WIN FOR HILLARY CLINTON 
YES IT WAS SHE HAD A CLINTON MARGIN OVER BARACK OBAMA OF TEN 
POINTS IN THE END WHICH WAS THE 
KIND OF FIGURE PEOPLE WERE SAYING 
SHE HAD TO GET TO KEEP HER HOPES 
ALIVE MORE THAN THAT THOUGH SHE 
WON AGAIN IN WHAT IS A BIG BATTLE 
STATE SHE HAS WON THEM BEFORE 
STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA TEXAS AND 
OHIO AND SHE WILL USE THIS VICTORY 
TO SAY LOOK I CAN WIN THE BIG 
STATES THE KIND OF STATES WE NEED 
TO WIN AGAINST THE REPUBLICANS 
WHERE BARACK OBAMA CAN'T IT IT TURNING INTO QUITE A BITTER BATTLE 
BUT BARACK OBAMA HAS MORE STATES 
AND DELEGATES AND CERTAINLY A LOT 
MORE MONEY WHERE DO YOU THINK THIS 
CONTEST WILL GO NOW 
IT COULD GO 
ALL THE WAY TO THE QENCTION IN THE 
LATE SUMMER BUT BOTH CONVENTION 
IN THE LATE SUMMER BUT BOTH 
CANDIDATES HOPE IT WILL END BEFORE 
THAT BUT YOU'RE RIGHT BARACK 
OBAMA HAS THE LEADS HILLARY 
CLINTON DESPITE THE WIN LAST NIGHT 
STILL ONLY HAS NINE DELEGATES 
OBAMA HAS THE POPULAR VOTE BUT THE 
CLINTON CAMPAIGN BELIEVE THEY 
DELIVERED A PSYCHOLOGICAL BLOW TO 
HIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE IT WILL CAUSE 
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE FINAL SAY 
TO THINK AGAIN IS BARACK OBAMA THE 
KIND OF CANDIDATE WHO CAN WITH 
STAND THE PRESSURE AND BEAT JOHN 
MCCAIN HILLARY CLINTON IS HOPING 
THIS RESULT WILL MAKE THE 
SUPERDELEGATES THINK AGAIN THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
YOU CAN GET MORE FROM THE B. B. C. 
WEBSITE WEBSITE POLICE IN REDDITCH WILL CONTINUE 
THEIR SEARCH TODAY FOR A DISABLED 
MAN DESCRIBED AS EXTREMELY 
VULNERABLE JAMES HUGHES WHO IS TWENTY TWO 
HAS THE MENTAL AGE OF AN EIGHTEEN MONTH 
OLD CHILD JAMES AND HIS MOTHER 
HEATHER WERE REPORTED MISSING AT 
THE WEEKEND AND SHE WAS FOUND DEAD 
TWO DAYS LATE ARE 
A CHARITY WANTS ALL SCHOOL CHILDREN 
TO TAKE A COURSE ON HEALTH AND 
SAFETY AT WORK AS PART OF THE 
NATIONAL CURRICULUM THOUSANDS OF 
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SERIOUSLY INJURED 
WHEN THEY GO OUT TO WORK EACH YEAR 
THOUSANDS OF SCHOOLS SAY THEY'RE 
GOING TO CLOSE TOMORROW BECAUSE OF 
A STRIKE BY THE NATIONAL UNION OF 
TEACHERS BUT IN SOME CASES ONLY 
SELECTED CLASSES WILL BE CLOSED 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONDEMNED THE 
ACTION SAYING IT WILL HARM PUPILS 
AND INCONVENIENCE PARENTS IT WILL 
BE THE FIRST NATIONAL STRIKE BY 
TEACHERS FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS THE NATIONAL 
UNION OF TEACHERS ACCEPTS THEIR PAY 
HAS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE 
THE ONE HUNDRED NINETY BUT SAY THE CURRENT PAY 
OFFER OF JUST UNDER TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IS BELOW 
INFLATION AND WILL ERODE THEIR 
GAINS 
IT IS TRUE THAT THE GAINS GOVERNMENT DID PUT SOME MONEY INTO 
TEACHERS' PAY EARLIER ON BUT AT 
THREE YEARS OF BELOW INFLATION PAY 
REEFS THAT IS BEGINNING TO BE 
ERODED 
A B. B. C. SURVEY 
OF ALMOST HALF ERODED OF ALL LOCAL AUTHORITIES SHOWS A 
STRIKE WILL CAUSE MAJOR 
D. I. S. R. U. P. T. I. O. N. FOUR SIXTY SIX SCHOOLS SAY THEY 
ARE PLANNING PARTIAL OR TOTAL 
CLOSURES THAT WILL EQUATE TO TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT 
OF ALL PRIMARY AND SECONDARY 
SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND AND WALES THE THE VAST MAJORITY OF TEACHERS I 
BELIEVE DON'T WANT TO STRIKE AND 
EVEN IN THE NUT THE VAST MAJORITY 
DIDN'T VOTE TO STRIKE AND ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY PARENTS WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE DISRUPTION 
THE ONE DAY STRIKE IS NOT BACKED BY 
OTHER TEACHING UNIONS BUT THE NUT 
SAYS IF IT IS SUCCESSFUL THE UNION 
MAY CONSIDER PROGRAMME OF ROLLING 
INDUSTRIAL ACTION RAISING THE 
PROSPECT OF SUMMER OF DISCONTENT 
AND INCONVENIENCE IN SCHOOLS 
WE'RE ALREADY GETTING AN INCREDIBLE 
RESPONSE FROM YOU ABOUT THE 
TEACHING STRIKE TOMORROW IN ENGLAND 
AND WALES IF YOU ARE PARENT 
STUDENT OR TEACHER SEND YOUR VIEWS 
IN IN RESCUE WORKERS ARE SEARCHING FOR A 
ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIEST WHO HAS GONE 
MISSING OFF THE SOUTHERN COAST OF 
BRAZIL HE TOOK OFF WITH THOUSANDS 
OF HELIUM FILLED BALLOONS TO BREAK 
A WORLD RECORD HE TOOK OFF WITH A 
MOBILE PHONE AND TRACKING DEVICES 
AND G. P. S. BUT HAS NOT BEEN SEEN FOR 
TWO DAYS A BUILDER FED UP WITH THE 
LACK OF PAYMENT FROM A CUSTOMER HAS 
DEMOLISHED THE WORK HE DID THE 
BUILDER SAID HE REACHED THE END OF 
HIS TETHER BECAUSE OF DEADLINES 
MISSED FOR PAYMENT FOR HIS WORK 
ENGLISH HERITAGE ARE SAYING THAT 
MORE PEOPLE CELEBRATE SAINT PATRICK'S 
DAY AND EVEN BONFIRE NIGHT THAN SAINT 
GEORGE'S DAY AND THE AGENCY IS 
PUBLISHING SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO 
MARK THE SPECIAL DAY WOMEN WHO 
CONSUME MORE CALORIES AND MORE 
CEREAL ARE MORE LIKELY TO CONCEIVE 
A BOY 
WHETHER YOUR BABY IS AL BOY OR 
GIRL IS MOSTLY DOWN TO CHANCE BUT 
A NEW STUDY FOUND A LINK WITH 
MUM'S DIET NOT DURING PREGNANCY 
BUT AROUND THE TIME SHE CONCEIVED 
THOSE WHO ATE MORE AND HAD A 
HEALTHIER DIET HAD SLIGHTLY MORE 
BOYS AND ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ATE 
CEREAL FOR BREAKFAST 
MOST PARENTS ARE JUST HAPPY TO HAVE 
A HEALTHY BABY WHATEVER THE SEX 
BUT IF THEY DO HAVE A SLIGHT 
PREFERENCE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER 
THEN IT SEEMS ADJUSTING THE WOMAN'S 
DIET MAY BE ONE WAY TO IMPROVE THE 
OUTCOME WHAT DO THESE MUMS MAKE OF 
IT 
I CAN'T REMEMBER BUT I SEEM TO IT REMEMBER EATING QUITE A LOT AND I 
ALWAYS EAT CEREAL WHICH WOULD MEAN 
I WOULD HAVE A BOY BUT SHE IS A 
GIRL 
I ALWAYS CONSUME A LOT OF GIRL CALORIES AND I EAT A LOT OF CEREAL 
AND I HAVE A BOY SO IT IS THE CASE 
FOR ME 
SCIENTISTS SAY IT COULD 
EXPLAIN WHY THE BIRTHS OF BOYS IN 
SOME COUNTRIES ARE LOWER THAN 
EXPECTED 
OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS EXPECTED YOUNG WOMEN IN PARTICULAR ARE 
DECREASING THEIR CALORIE INTAKE ON 
AVERAGE AND THERE IS AN INCREASE 
IN UNHEALTHY EATING PATTERNS LIKE 
SKIPPING BREAKFAST AND THIS 
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT HEALTHY EATING 
PATTERNS INCLUDING REGULAR 
BREAKFAST EATING SEEMS TO BE 
ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING BOYS BUT BUT MANY SAY THAT A MUM'S HEALTHY DIET 
IS PARAMOUNT AND NOT JUST IN 
CHOOSING THE SEX OF THEIR BABY 
SO SIAN WHO HAS THREE BOYS DID 
YOU EAT A HEALTHY BREAKFAST 
YES I 
HAVE BROTHERS WHO HAVE BOYS AS WELL 
SO BREAKFAST IS BIG IN THE WILLIAMS 
HOUSEHOLDS HOUSEHOLDS AND BACK TO THE AMERICAN 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS HILLARY 
CLINTON HAS KEPT HER HOPES ALIVE BY 
BEATING BARACK OBAMA IN THE 
PENNSYLVANIA PRIMARY 
SHE HAD FALLEN BEHIND IN THE 
CAMPAIGN BUT ARE WE ANY CLOSER TO 
FINDING OUT WHO THE DEMOCRATIC 
NOMINEE IS GOING TO BE MARY JORDAN 
JOINS US FROM THE WASHINGTON POST 
WELL THE ANSWER IS NO THE HOPE 
FOR THE BARACK OBAMA PEOPLE WOULD 
BE THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE A 
DIVISIVE WIN AND SHE WOULD GO AWAY 
AND LET BARACK OBAMA UNIFY THE 
PARTY AND HAVE A STRONG CANDIDATE 
AGAINST THE REPUBLICAN MCCAIN THE THE ONLY PEOPLE REALLY CELEBRATING ARE 
THE MCCAIN CAMP 
THE REPUBLICANS 
ARE DELIGHTED IT WAS A BIG 
UNEXPECTED FOUR HOURS AFTER THE 
POSTS CLOSED LAST NIGHT HILLARY 
CLINTON RAISED TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SHE IS 
FIGHTING AND CONTINUING ON AND IT 
WILL DIVIDE THE DEMOCRAT PARTY AND 
JOHN MCCAIN IS SITTING PRETTY 
NOBODY IS ATTACKING HIM HE IS AN 
OLD GUY WHO HAS A LOT OF PROBLEMS 
BUT THE SLUG FEST BETWEEN THE 
DEMOCRATS IS ERODING THEM 
AND IT CAN ONLY GET WORSE FOR THE 
DEMOCRATS CAN'T IT 
I THINK SO 
FIRST OF ALL THESE TWO CANDIDATES 
EITHER ONE OF THEM THEY WERE 
STRONG AND SUPPOSED TO WALTZ INTO 
THE WHITE HOUSE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO 
BE AN ANTI BUSH VOTE AND AN ANTI 
IRAQ VOTE AND NOW THE DAMAGE IS 
DONE ESPECIALLY WITH A NEGATIVE 
CAMPAIGN THERE IS SO MUCH PASSION 
IN THIS RACE PEOPLE ARE CRYING 
WOMEN WANT HILLARY TO WIN AND THE 
PEOPLE WANT OBAMA TO WIN THERE IS 
SO MUCH PASSION IN THIS CAMPAIGN 
AND THE TWO STATES WHICH HAVE NOT 
HAD DEMOCRAT PRIMARIES BECAUSE OF 
A TECHNICAL ROW ARE MICHIGAN AND 
FLORIDA 
YES AND YOU'LL HEAR A LOT FLORIDA ABOUT THAT FROM HILLARY SHE'LL BE 
SAYING THAT SHE IS THE RIGHT 
NOMINEE BECAUSE OF THE TECHNICAL 
ERROR SO IT WILL BE RIGHT UP TO 
JUNE WHEN THE PRIMARIES FINALLY END 
AND THEN THE CONVENTION IN SUMMER 
WE WERE BEING TOLD BY PEOPLE LIKE 
YOU ON THIS VERY SOFA THAT WERE 
SAYING HILLARY CANNOT WIN 
WELL IT 
IS SO CLOSE OBAMA BY THE WAY HAS 
MOVED ON AND HE IS GOING TO WIN 
MOST LIKELY NORTH CAROLINA AND 
INDIANA IN THE COMING WEEKS BUT IT 
IS JUST THAT THIS WOMAN WON'T QUIT 
AND SHE DID REALLY WELL LAST NIGHT 
AND PEOPLE ARE STILL SENDING IN 
MONEY AND THEY WANT HILLARY IS IS THERE A ROAD MAP WHERE SHE CAN DIG 
OUT THE NUMBERS 
SHE SAYS THERE IS 
AND SHE SAYS HE'S FADING AND I'M 
RISING JUST WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT 
FLORIDA SOME OF THE OTHER COUNTS 
THESE STATES DIDN'T COUNT AND IN 
THE END THE MAGIC NUMBER WILL BE 
DECIDED BY THE SUPERDELEGATES IN 
THE END AND I'M GOING TO WIN THEM 
THAT IS CLINTON'S STRATEGY COULD COULD THEY HAVE A COURT BATTLE ABOUT IT 
THIS IS POLARISED AMERICA THEY 
CAN'T DECIDE WHO THEY WANT BUT 
THEY REALLY WANT SOMEBODY ELSE 
THEY WANT BUSH OUT 
TALK ABOUT 
PASSION IN POLITICS MARY THANK

MCDONALD'S MCDONALD'S FOR MACKIE D.'S AS HE CALLED 
IT EARLIER 
THE ROMANTIC IMAGE OF POACHERS 
TAKING ONE FOR THE POT ISN'T TRUE 
BECAUSE ORGANISED CRIMINAL GANGS 
ARE THREATENING BRITAIN'S WILDLIFE 
THAT'S THE MESSAGE FROM THE 
NATIONAL WILDLIFE CRIME UNIT WHICH 
SAYS POACHING IS A GROWING PROBLEM 
DANNY SAVAGE JOINS US THIS MORNING 
GOOD MORNING DO YOU DANNY 
GOOD MORNING SIAN 
EVERY YEAR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS 
OF ANIMALS ARE TAKEN FROM THE 
COUNTRYSIDE ILLEGALLY ON LAND AND 
IN RIVERS AND THEY ARE SOLD ON FOR 
PROFIT BY THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE THEM 
NOW THE OLD ROMANTIC IMAGES OF OF 
SOMEBODY WHO TAKES ONE OR TWO FOR 
THE FAMILY POT BUT POLICE SAY THAT 
ISN'T TRUE AND THEY ARE SAYING IT 
IS A PRIORITY CRIME IN RURAL AREAS 
AND IN IN A MOMENT WE WILL BE 
TALKING ABOUT THE THE THE PROBLEM 
OF PEOPLE TAKING SALMON BUT I HAVE 
BEEN OUT ON ONE ANTI POACHING 
OPERATION IN CUMBRIA 
LATE AT NIGHT IN THE LAKE DISTRICT 
THIS IS HOW POACHERS WORK CATCH A 
DEER DEER STAG IN THE BEAM OF A 
LAMP AND THEY CAN START TO BEHAVE 
NOT TIMIDLY BUT ALMOST LIKE A TAME 
ANIMAL WITHIN SECONDS THIS DEER 
HAS WALKED ALMOST RIGHT UP TO THE 
LIGHT LIGHT A POACHER WOULD SEND A DOG DOWN THE 
BEAM OR USE A RIFLE BUT THIS STAG 
IS LUCKY THE LAMP HOLDER IS A 
POLICEMAN POLICEMAN THE OLD ROMANTIC IMAGE OF A GUY 
LIVING IN THE COUNTRY WITH A FAMILY 
ON A LOW WAGE NIPPING OUT THE BACK 
DOOR INTO THE WOODS AND THE FIELDS 
AT NIGHT TO TAKE A RABBIT OR FESAN 
OR TWO TO FEED HIS FAMILY ISN'T 
TRUE ANYMORE THESE PEOPLE ARE IN 
IT FOR MONEY AND SOMETIMES FOR WHAT 
THEY WOULD CALL SPORT I CERTAINLY 
WOULDN'T WOULDN'T WE WERE OUT ON AN ANTI POACHING 
OPERATION FOLLOWING A BRIEFING 
EARLIER IN THE EVENING 
WE ARE GOING TO DO THE SAME AS WE 
NORMALLY DO WHICH IS PEOPLE GOING 
OUT TO THE PLACES THAT ARE SELECTED 
TO REPORT ANY ILLEGAL ACTIVITY 
GAMEKEEPERS AND LANDOWNERS WERE 
TAKING PART TRYING TO TACKLE A 
GROWING PROBLEM 
I REGARD IT AS 
STEALING IT IS AN ARMED ROBBERY 
IF IF SOMEONE CAME INTO YOUR HOUSE 
WITH A GUN AND NICKED YOUR 
TELEVISION AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM 
OF IT THAT WOULD BE REGARDED BY 
POLICE AS ARMED ROBBERY AND I 
CONDITION SEE THE DIFFERENCE 
ONE OF THE WATCHERS HAS SEEN 
VEHICLE TRAVELLING INTO THE AREA 
A FEW HOURS THE WATCHING WAYS OFF 
BUT FINDING THE SUSPICIOUS CAR IS A 
PROBLEM PROBLEM WITHIN MINUTES THE NETWORK OF 
WATCHERS GET A RESULT 
STAND BY STAND BY BUT THE SUSPICIOUS PICK UP TURNS 
OUT TO BE LOCAL FARMERMENT 
WELL I THOUGHT SOMEBODY WAS AFTER 
ME DEER IN THE BOTTOM 
FIELDS 
IT PROVES THE SYSTEM WORKS 
THE NEXT TIME YOU GO OUT LAMPING 
GIVE US A A RING 
TONIGHT'S OPERATION IS WINNING DOWN 
BUT WINDING DOWN BUT EVEN THOUGH 
NO POACHERS HAS BEEN CAUGHT 
BECAUSE THERE IS A FEELING THAT THE 
WORD IS OUT THAT POACHING IS BEING 
TAKEN SERIOUSLY IN CUMBRIA WHETHER 
THAT MEANS THE PROBLEM IS JUST 
MOVED ON ISN'T CLEAR BUT AT LEAST 
THESE DEER ARE BEING AFFORDED 
PROTECTION PROTECTION THAT'S THE PROBLEM IN CUMBRIA BUT 
ON TYNESIDE THE PROBLEMS TO DO 
WITH PEOPLE TAKING SALMON FROM THE 
TYNE IT HAS BECOME ONE OF THE BEST 
SALMON RIVERS WITH ME IS KEVIN AND 
DAVID FROM THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY 
WHO ENFORCE THE RULES OF THE RIVER 
IF YOU LIKE AND YOU TRY AND CATCH 
THE POACHERS AS WELL KEVIN HOW 
BIG IS THE PROBLEM HERE 
IFS A 
BIGGER PROBLEM THAN THE PUBLIC 
REALISE THIS STRETCH THAT'S BEHIND 
US NOW IS ONE OF OUR PRIORITY 
AREAS AREAS THIS STRETCH ALONE POACHERS HAVE 
TAKEN HALLS OF SALMON TO THE VALUE 
OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND THAT'S IN ONE NIGHT 
INSTANCES OF WHERE POACHERS HAVE 
TAKEN HALLS TO THE HAULS TO 
THE VALUE OF THREE THOUSAND IN A NIGHT WE 
CARRIED OUT SEARCHES AND WE FOUND 
OUT HOW MUCH THEY WERE MAKING 
A WILD SALMON 
Y. 
A BETTER 
PREMIUM THAN FARMED SALMON THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT YES 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ORGANIC SIDE OF 
THING WILD SALMON CARRY A PREMIUM 
THEY ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE 
THE FARMED VARIETY 
DO PEOPLE THINK THAT THAT POACHERS 
ARE LOVABLE ROGUES TAKING ONE FOR 
THE POT WHAT'S YOUR EXPERIENCE 
THE PUBLIC HAVE THE PERCEPTION THAT 
THE POACHER IS A ROBIN HOOD FIGURE 
THEY ARE INVOLVED IN OTHER SORTS OF 
CRIME NOT JUST POACHING AND THIS 
IS ONE OF THE ACTIVITIES THEY CARRY 
OUT OUT THIS IS THE GEAR YOU HAVE TO WEAR 
THE STAB VEST HANDCUFFS A BATON 
AS WELL 
JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE DO 
YOU NEED TO USE IT A LOT

THE OFFICIAL ESTIMATE AND CARD 
DETAILS HAVE BEEN FOUND WIDELY

THOUSANDS OF SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND AND 
WALES SAY THEY'RE GOING TO CLOSE 
TOMORROW BECAUSE OF STRIKE BY THE 
NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS 
A SURVEY BY THE B. B. C. SUGGESTS THAT

PASSIONATELY OR COMPLETELY CLOSED 
THE GOVERNMENT CONDEMNS THE ACTION 
SAYING IT WILL HARM PUPILS AND 
INCONVENIENCE PARENTS ENGLISH 
HERITAGE SAY MORE PEOPLE CELEBRATE 
SAINT PATRICK'S DAY AND BONFIRE NIGHT 
THAN SAINT GEORGE'S DAY AND THEY ARE 
PUBLISHES WAYS TO SUGGEST HOW 
PEOPLE CAN MARK THE EVENT YOU ARE 
WHAT YOU EAT SCIENTISTS SAY THAT 
WOMEN WHO CONSUME MORE CALORIES AND 
MORE BREAKFAST CEREALS WHEN THEY 
ARE TRYING TO CONCEIVE COULD HAVE 
MORE CHANCE OF HAVING A BOY 
IT SOUNDS BIZARRE DOESN'T IT WE 
ALL THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE DOWN 
TO X. AND Y. CHROMOSOMES BUT IT 
ISN'T AND LATER WE ARE HAVING 
LOOK AT THE LATEST WORK WEAR BY THE 
FASHION DESIGNER BRUCE OLDFIELD 
OH IT'S MACKIE D.'S AS AARON CALLS 
IT IT HELLO CHRIS 
I RANG MY MUM ABOUT 
WHETHER SHE ATE MORE CEREAL AND AT 
SIX POINT THREE OH SHE WAS WHY ARE YOU CALLING 
ME AT THIS TIME BUT NEVER MIND 
AND THAT OWN GOAL LAST NIGHT COULD 
HAVE SWUNG THE TIDE 
IT WASN'T A GREAT SPECTACLE BUT 
AFTER NINETY MINUTES THE TIE BETWEEN 
LIVERPOOL AND CHELSEA IS STILL 
BEAUTIFULLY BALANCED 
IT FINISHED ONE TO ONE BUT CHELSEA WILL 
HAVE THE SLIGHT PSYCHOLOGICAL 
ADVANTAGE WITH THAT AWAY GOAL 
THANKS TO A LATE EQUALISER 
IT PROMISED TO BE ANOTHER THRILLING 
NIGHT AT ANFIELD EVEN LIVERPOOL'S 
CONTROVERSIAL CO OWNER TOM HICKS 
WAS IN GOOD VOICE WELL SORT OF 
AND THE HOME FANS HAD PLENTY TO 
SING ABOUT WHEN DIRK KUYT SQUIRMED 
FREE IN THE FORTY THIRD MINUTE TO FIRE 
LIVERPOOL IN FRONT 
CHELSEA HAD PLENTY OF POSSESSION 
BUT MADE FEW CHANCES AND IT TOOK A 
COUPLE OF EXCELLENT SAVES FROM PETR 
CECH TO PREVENT LIVERPOOL FROM 
ADDING TO THEIR SCORE 
BUT IN THE FIFTH MINUTE OF EXTRA 
TIME THE TIE WAS TURNED ON IT'S 
HEAD HEAD SALOMAN KALOU'S CROSS WAS TURNED 
INTO HIS OWN NET BY JOHN ARNE RIISE 
THAT CRUCIAL AWAY GOAL MEANS THAT 
LIVERPOOL MUST NOW SCORE AT 
STAMFORD BRIDGE IN THE SECOND LEG 
A FEAT THEY HAVEN'T ACHIEVED IN 
EIGHT ATTEMPTS 
IT'S MANCHESTER UNITED'S TURN 
TONIGHT 
WE HAD THREE CLEAR CHANCES AND IT'S 
DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE YOU NEED TO 
TAKE YOUR CHANCES AND WE'RE 
DISAPPOINTED WE KNOW WE NEED TO GO 
TO STAMFORD BRIDGE AND WIN SO WE 
NEED TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT NINETY 
MINUTES WE HAD OUR CHANCES TODAY 
AND WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE OUR CHANCES 
WE HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE IN 
OURSELVES 
WE WANT TO BE IN THE OURSELVES FINAL I THINK WE MADE A BIG STEP 
TODAY AND WE CAN USE IT BUT IT IS 
OUR TARGET FROM DAY ONE THAT I'M 
HERE IT IS THE TARGET OF CHELSEA 
TO BE A BIG CLUB NEEDS TO BE IN 
THE FINAL OF THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE

SIR ALEX FERGUSON DOESN'T HAVE ANY 
MAJOR INJURY WORRIES BUT HE HOPES 
HIS SIDE CAN IMPROVE ON LAST SEASON 
WHEN THEY WENT OUT OF THE 
COMPETITION AT THIS STAGE 
I THINK WE ARE IN A STRONGER 
POSITION THIS TIME IN TERMS OF THE 
TEAM AND PLAYER ABILITY LAST YEAR 
WE WERE PUTTING IN THE SAME PLAYERS 
ALL THE TIME SO HOPEFULLY THAT 
DOES MAKE DIFFERENCE TO US AND 
THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO ENJOY 
TOMORROW AND THIS WE INTEND TO DO

HENRY IN ATTACK

TURN INTO TWO MORE AND THEN A 
BLOCK BUSTER FIGHT 
TURNING TO THE PAPERS THIS IS 
ROBERT DEE A BRITISH TENNIS 
SENSATION BUT NAMED THE WORLD'S 
WORST THERE IS A SAYING TRY TRY 
AND TRY AGAIN HE LOST HIS FIRST 
FIFTY FOUR MATCHES WITHOUT WINNING A SINGLE 
SET BUT IN HIS FIFTY FIFTH MATCH HE WON 
THE MATCH THANK GOODNESS HE 
EQUALS AN ALL TIME RECORD FOR 
DEFEATS BUT SADLY HE LOST HIS NEXT 
ROUND MATCH BUT HOPEFULLY THAT 
WILL BE SOMETHING TO BUILD UPON 
HE'S NOT THE WORST IN THE WORLD 
I'M 
THE WORST IN THE WORLD YES YES THE FACT IS HE'S A PRETTY GOOD 
PLAYER HE'S SOMETHING LIKE ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOURTH 
IN THE WORLD SOMETHING WE COULD 
ONLY DREAM OF 
YOU KNOW THE SAYING 
WE ARE WHAT WE EAT BUT NOW IT 
COULD BE WHAT YOU EAT ARE YOUR 
CHILDREN CHILDREN WOMEN WHO EAT CEREAL SEEM TO BE 
MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A BOY IN FOLK 
LOWER THERE HAVE BEEN ALL SORTS OF 
WIVES' TALES OVER HOW TO FALL 
PREGNANT WITH A BOY IN ONE WAY OR 
ANOTHER OR A GIRL TO HAVE A BOY 
EAT MORE RED MEAT EAT MORE SALT 
AND TO HAVE A GIRL EAT MORE FISH 
EAT MORE CHOCOLATE AND CONCEIVE IN 
THE SAME MONTH AS THE MUM'S BIRTH 
DAY IS THAT THE MUM OF THE BABY 
OR THE MUM'S MUM 
JOINING US ARE LARA GREEN AND KATIE 
BREATHWICK WHO HAS TWO BOYS ARE 
YOU A BIG CEREAL EATER 
WELL YES 
BUT I DON'T THINK THIS HAS ANYTHING 
TO DO WITH IT THERE COULD BE 
EVIDENCE THAT IT AFFECTS THE P. H. 
LEVEL IN THE UTERUS AND THAT COULD 
AFFECT THE SPERM AND THE REST OF IT 
BUT I HAVE TWO BOYS AND MY SISTER 
AND SISTERS IN LAW BETWEEN THEM 
HAVE FIVE OTHER BOYS AND THEY ARE 
STICK THIN AND NEVER EAT RED MEAT 
SO 
I DON'T PUT MUCH STORE BY IT I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL ABOUT CHROMOSOMES 
YES IT IS A REALLY CHROMOSOMES INTERESTING PIECE OF STUDY 
A LOT 
OF RESEARCH HAS GONE INTO FINDING 
OUT ABOUT TYPES OF DIET AND GENDER 
BUT NOTHING MUCH HAS COME OF IT 
AND THIS RESEARCH IS INTERESTING TO 
READ AND IT SEEMS THERE IS PERHAPS 
A LINK BETWEEN THE TYPES OF FOOD WE 
EAT AND INDEED HOW MUCH WE EAT 
AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A LINK 
BETWEEN WHETHER WE HAVE A BOY OR A 
GIRL GIRL AND I KNOW THIS IS SIGNIFICANT 
RESEARCH AND IT COMES FROM THE 
UNIVERSITY OF EXETER AND OTHERS 
AND IT HAS VALIDITY BUT IT JUST 
DOESN'T KIND OF FEEL RIGHT BECAUSE 
WHEAT HAS ONLY BEEN PRODUCED IN THE 
PAST FIVE HUNDRED YEARS SO WOULDN'T WE JUST 
HAVE WHOLE LOT MORE BOYS Y. YES YES IT DOES SEEM A LONG SHOT THEY THEY LOOKED AT EIGHT HUNDRED WOMEN AND TEN PER CENT OF 
THOSE HAD MORE BOYS BASED ON THEIR 
DIET THEY WERE EATING MORE AND HAD 
AROUND TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED CALORIES A DAY AND 
THEY WERE HAVING MORE BOYS AS 
OPPOSED TO THE WOMEN HAVING A LOWER 
GLUCOSE LEVEL AND EATING LESS 
CEREALS THAN THE ONES THAT HAD BOYS 
BUT THAT WAS A SMALL STUDY AND IT 
NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT SO WE HAD 
BETTER NOT GO AROUND SAYING YOU 
NEED TO EAT DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE 
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF DISAPPOINTED 
MUMS MUMS AND YOU ARE THE EXCEPTION 
YES MY 
MUM SAID NOT ANOTHER BLOODY BOY 
SHE NOW HAS FIVE GRAND SONS AND 
THREE SONS SO EIGHT BOYS IN TOTAL 
AND IT'S A BIT UNFAIR 
IT'S THE 
SAME IN MY FAMILY L. HAVE THREE 
BOYS AND TWO BROTHERS WHO HAVE FIVE 
BOYS AMONGST THEM AND ONLY ONE GIRL 
SOME FAMILIES SEEM PREDETERMINED 
YOU THINK YOU HAVE PROBLEMS LOOK 
AT THIS THIS IS SUPERMUM WENDY 
WHO IS DESPERATE TO HAVE A GIRL 
BECAUSE SHE HAS ONLY EIGHT BOYS 
HOW DOES SHE DO IT 
SHE IS 
OBVIOUSLY EATING FAR TOO MUCH 
CEREAL 
SHE NEEDS TO STOP HAVING CEREAL BABIES 
OR WILL SHE JUST KEEP GOING BABIES UNTIL SHE GETS THAT GIRL SIAN HAS 
HAD BOYS AND HER YOUNGEST IS LESS 
THAN TWO NOW BUT SHE USED TO EAT 
GUNK FOR BREAKFAST WHAT 
WAS IT IT IT WAS SPIRALEARA AND I WAS TOLD TO 
EAT IT BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF 
VITAMIN A 
A HIGH VITAMIN CONTENT 
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN STARVING 
OURSELVES OURSELVES UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVEN'T WORKED 
OUT YET HOW TO GET THE GENDER YOU 
WANT 
DEFINITELY AND THERE IS A WANT WHOLE LOT MORE RESEARCH THAT NEEDS 
TO BE DONE AND IT WILL BE GOING ON 
FOR YEARS TO COME BUT PEOPLE CAN 
HAVE A LOT OF FUN GUESSING IN THE 
MEANTIME 
FATHERS WITH A SWEET TOOTH TEND TO 
HAVE SONS AND GEOFF SAYS I WAS 
TAUGHT AT SCHOOL A CHILD'S SEX WAS 
DETERMINED BY THE SPERM THAT 
FERTILISES THE EGG 
I WAS TOLD IF YOU WANTED BOY THE 
FATHER SHOULD HAVE THAT DARK YEASTY 
STUFF MARMITE THE ONE I WAS

RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT RAIN IS A 
WEATHER FRONT THAT HAS BEEN PUSHING 
IN OFF THE ATLANTIC THROUGH THE 
NIGHT YOU CAN SEE THE CLOUD ON THE 
SATELLITE PICTURE IT IS A 
NARROWBAND OF CLOUD IF YOU STRIP 
AWAY THAT YOU CAN SEE THE RAIN HAS

A DESIGNER MAKE OVER FOR MCDONALD'S 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FASHION 
FAMOUS FASHION DESIGNER BRUCE 
OLDFIELD HE IS FAMOUS FOR HIS 
DESIGNS FOR HIS GLAMOROUS GOWNS 
WORN BY THE LIKES OF DIANA 
PRINCESS OF WALES CATHERINE ZETA 
JONES BUT TODAY HE UNVEILS HIS 
LATEST COLLECTION FOR MCDONALD'S 
WE SENT OUT OUR VERY OWN BRIAN 
MILLIGAN TO TAKE A LOOK AT THESE 
UNIFORMS ONCE THE LOGO SIGNIFIED A 
TAKE AWAY SOON IT MIGHT BE A 
FASHION STATEMENT 
IF IT LOOKS LIKE BROWN THE COLOUR 
OF THE NEW MCDONALD'S UNIFORM IT 
IS OFFICIALLY MOCCA AND THE 
MANAGER'S SHIRTS ARE SAID TO BE 
BUSINESS CUTS SOON ALL OF THE 
STAFF WILL ADOPT THE UNIFORM AND AS 
IS OBLIGATORY IN THE COUNTRY 
THEY'RE LOVING IT ACCORDING TO 
BRUCE OLDFIELD THERE WERE DESIGN 
PROBLEMS DISCOVERED DURING WEARER 
TRIALS 
WE DISCOVERED THERE WAS ONE TRIALS DESIGN OF SHIRT AND IT CHAFFED WE 
DIDN'T WANT OUR GIRLS CHAFFED 
THE QUEEN'S DRESS DESIGNER DESIGNED 
UNIFORMS FOR THE METROPOLITAN 
POLICE IN THE SAME YEAR AND IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE 
CHRISTIAN DIOR SHOWED OFF THESE 
NURSING DESIGNS WHERE CAN DESIGNER 
UNIFORMS GO WRONG 
YOU DON'T WANT 
PEOPLE TO DRESS UP LIKE BILLBOARDS 
YOU WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE 
COLOURS LIKE RED CAN BE DIFFICULT 
WITH SKIN TYPES YOU HAVE TO DESIGN 
AGAINST THAT WHICH IS USUALLY WHY 
MOST BRANDS WILL HAVE A RANGE OF 
COLOURS 
MCDONALD'S SAYS THE NEW COLOURS UNIFORM SHOULD HELP CLOSE THE GAP 
BETWEEN THE PERCEPTION AND REALITY 
OF WORKING HERE WEARING AN OUTFIT 
LIKE THIS SHOULD HELP STAFF FEEL 
MORE JULIAN MCDONALD THAN RONALD 
MCDONALD MCDONALD AT LEAST WE KNOW THE NEW UNIFORM 
DOESN'T CHAFF 
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT 
VERY THING 
SPEAKING OF WHICH 
WOULD YOU PREFER A THREE MILE RUN 
OR AN HOUR OF DIGGING IN THE GARDEN 
IF SWEATING IT OUT IN THE GYM ISN'T 
YOUR THING NEVER FEAR THERE IS A 
NEW ALTERNATIVE 
IT INVOLVES FRESH AIR WELLIES AND 
GARDENING GLOVES 
GOOD MORNING IT IS A RATHER WET 
DAY HERE BUT WE ARE BECOMING ONE 
OF THE FATTEST NATIONS IN EUROPE 
AND WE ARE ALWAYS BEING TOLD TO 
KEEP FIT AND LOSE WEIGHT NOW YOU 
COULD DO IT BY GARDENING ACTUALLY 
SPENDING AN HOUR GARDENING LIKE 
THIS IS PROBABLY EQUIVALENT OF 
SPENDING AN HOUR IN THE GYM THIS 
IS A GREEN GYM KEEPING FIT 
OUTDOORS AND IN A MOMENT WE WILL BE 
TALKING TO THE G. P. WHOSE IDEA IT WAS 
TEN YEARS AGO BUT FIRST LET'S HAVE 
A LOOK AT OTHER GREEN GYM PROJECTS 
COME RAIN OR SHINE 
HIDDEN AWAY IN AN OXFORDSHIRE 
GLAIED A DIFFERENT KIND OF FITNESS 
REGIME WHERE A DUMB BELLS ARE 
REPLACED BY SAWS THIS IS A GREEN 
GYM A WAY TO GET FIT OUTDOORS IN IN THE PAST G. P.'S ANSWER TO GETTING 
FIGURE IS ALL ABOUT GO TO THE GYM 
BUT SO MANY PEOPLE HATE THE GYM OR 
THEY HATE THE COMMON METHODS OF 
GETTING FIT SLOWLY THEY ARE 
REALISING AND THE GOVERNMENT IS IS 
REALISING AS WELL THIS IS AN IDEAL 
ALTERNATIVE 
HERE IN OXFORDSHIRE ALTERNATIVE TODAY'S WORKOUT IS RESTORING A 
WATER MEADOW TO ITS FORMER GLORY I I AM JUST A MUSICIAN I AM NOT 
EXPERIENCED IN THIS SORT OF THING 
AT ALL 
I HAVE COME TO LIVE HERE 
AND IT IS FASCINATING TO HELP CLEAR 
THEM AND MAKE THEM USABLE BY CATTLE 
AND WILDLIFE 
IT BURNS CALORIES SO 
HERE I AM GETTING MORE BEAUTIFUL 
BY THE MINUTE 
THERE ARE ALMOST ONE HUNDRED 
ONE HUNDRED GREEN GYMS SET UP AROUND THE U. K. 
SUPPORTED BY THOUSANDS OF 
VOLUNTEERS AND WHO WOULD HAVE 
THOUGHT THAT A SIMPLE IDEA FROM AN 
OXFORDSHIRE G. P. WOULD PROVE SO 
POPULAR THAT GREEN GYMS ARE 
SPRINGING UP NOW AS FAR AFIELD AS 
AUSTRALIA THE WEEKLY WORKOUTS ARE 
ALL DIFFERENT ONE WEEK IT WILL 
CLEARING WOOD THE NEXT BUILDING 
FENCES AND THERE ARE NO SHORTAGE 
OF PROJECTS 
JUST BEING OUTSIDE ON A LOVELY DAY 
LIKE THIS IS FANTASTIC THE 
SATISFACTION OF SEEING THE FENCE 
REPAIRED AND SEEING THE COWS IN THE 
FIELD AND SEEING THE WATER RUNNING 
IS FANTASTIC FOR THE VOLUNTEERS 
THEY LOVE IT 
AFTER A MORNING'S 
HARD SLOG THE PERFECT WAY TO END A 
WORKOUT TEA AND BISCUITS 
I WOULD LOVE SOME TEA AND BISCUITS 
RIGHT NOW PLANTING IS GOOD FOR 
YOUR HEALTH APPARENTLY DOCTOR WILLIAM 
BIRD WAS THE G. P. WHO HAD THE IDEA 
TEN YEARS AGO WHY DID YOU THINK 
THAT WORKING OUTSIDE WOULD BE SUCH 
A GOOD WAY OF GETTING FIT PEOPLE PEOPLE AREN'T DOING ENOUGH ACTIVITY WE 
ARE SITTING AT HOME NOT DOING VERY 
MANY THINGS AND PEOPLE WHO REALLY 
NEED TO HAVE THE EXERCISE DON'T 
WANT TO GO TO GYMS THEY GET 
EMBARRASSED WHEN THEY GO TO THE 
SWIMMING POOL THEY DON'T LIKE 
SPORT SO THEY ARE SAYING WHAT ELSE 
CAN WE DO THE ENVIRONMENT IS OUT 
HERE FREE AND IT HAS SO MANY OTHER 
BENEFITS IF YOU PUT A HEART 
MONITOR ON SOMEONE DOING A GREEN 
SKWREUL THEY WILL WITH THE 
CARDIOVASCULAR TRAINING ZONE FOR 
TWO HOURS YOU GET FANTASTIC EXTRA 
BENEFITS MEETING LOTS OF PEOPLE 
AND MENTAL HEALTH IS THERE AS WELL 
THIS WAS AN IDEA OF YOURS TEN YEARS 
AGO IT'S GROWN INTO A MASSIVE OAK 
TREE DID YOU THINK IT WOULD HAVE 
THAT IMPACT 
WE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT 
WAS A GOOD IDEA BUT IT'S BEEN 
FANTASTIC THE WAY IT HAS TAKEN OFF 
GOING ROUND THE WORLD NOW WHICH IS 
REALLY GOOD WE WANT IT TO BE MORE 
WE WANT EVERY COMMUNITY EVERY 
PRACTICE TO HAVE ONE HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY PRACTICES ACROSS THE U. K. WILL START 
HAVING GREEN GYMS AS A MATTER OF 
COURSE 
AS WE GET THE BENEFITS AND COURSE PEOPLE REALISE IT IS GOOD IT IS 
BETTER THAN TAKING MEDICATION AND 
IT IS PROBABLY BETTER THAN ALL 
THOSE GYMS WITH ALL THAT STAINLESS 
STEEL STEEL AROUND YOU

TO CARRY ON PLANTING KEEPING FIT 
ALONG WITH EVERYBODY ELSE WELL 
DONE EVERYBODY IT LOOKS AMAZING

HILLARY CLINTON DIDN'T JUST NEED TO

CLEAR CUT CONVINCING VICTORY THAT 
IS EXACTLY WHAT SHE DELIVERED WITH 
A TEN POINT LEAD OVER HER RIVAL 
BARACK OBAMA MORE THAN THAT SHE

CONGRATULATE HILLARY CLINTON ON HER 
VICTORY I WANT TO THANK SHE RAN A 
TERRIFIC RACE A AFTER THAT 
HOSTILE REACTION THERE FOLLOWED 
THIS SWIPE AT ITS RIVAL

FEAR AS A TACTIC THE THREAT OF 
TERRORISM TO SCARE UP VOTES OR WE 
CAN DECIDE THAT REAL STRENGTH IS 
ASKING THE TOUGH QUESTIONS BEFORE 
WE SEND OUR TROOPS IN TO FIGHT 
HILLARY CLINTON'S PERSEVERANCE IS 
PAYING OFF SHE IS STILL THE 
UNDERDOG BUT THIS EMBRACE SUGGESTS 
THEY THINK THEY HAVE ACHIEVED A 
BREAKTHROUGH IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
MATH IN THE U. S. THE FACTS HAVEN'T 
CHANGED BARACK OBAMA IS STILL 
LEADING BARACK OBAMA IN THE NUMBER 
OF STATES WON THAT SAID THE 
CLINTON CAMPAIGN BELIEVE THEY HAVE 
DELIVERED PSYCHOLOGICAL BLOW 
THEY BELIEVE THAT SUPERDELEGATES 
THE PEOPLE WHO COULD DECIDE THE 
CONTEST WILL NOW ASK SERIOUS 
QUESTION AS TO WHETHER BARACK OBAMA

THOUSANDS OF SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND AND 
WALES SAY THEY ARE GOING TO CLOSE 
TOMORROW BECAUSE OF STRIKE BY THE 
NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS CONDEMNED THE ACTION 
WHICH IT SAYS WILL ONLY HARM PUPILS 
AND INCONVENIENCE PARENTS OUR 
CORRESPONDENT JOIN US FROM SCHOOL 
IN EAST LONDON HOW ARE THEY 
PREPARING THERE 
GOOD MORNING TO YOU LIKE MANY 
SCHOOLS ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES 
THIS ONE IS GOING TO CLOSE 
COMPLETELY THE HEAD TEACHER SAYS 
SHE HAS TO MANY NUT MEMBERS IT'S 
NOT WORTH STAY OPEN IT'S THE NUT 
WITH SOME ONE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND MEMBERS HOW BIG 
WILL THE DISRUPTION BE WE HAVE 
CONTACTED EIGHTY NINE OUT OF ONE HUNDRED SIX LOCAL 
EDUCATION AUTHORITYS SO FAR IT 
SEEMS THAT AT LEAST THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY SIX SCHOOLS 
WILL BE CLOSED OR PARTIALLY CLOSED 
THAT IS AROUND TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT OF THE TOTAL 
IT COULD BE AROUND SIX THOUSAND OR MORE 
ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES THE 
TIMING OF THE STRIKE HAS COME IN 
FOR CRITICISM EXAM TIME IS NOT FAR 
AWAY THERE ARE FEARS IT COULD 
DISRUPT PUPIL'S PREPARATIONS FOR 
PARENTS AS WELL CHILDCARE IS AN 
ISSUE ONE AGENCY SAYS IT'S BEEN 
INUNDATED WITH REQUESTS WHY THE 
STRIKE IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY THE 
NUT SAYS THE OFFER OF ABOUT TWENTY SIX PER CENT 
INCREASE IS NOT ENOUGH IT'S 
LOOKING FOR AN INCREASE OF JUST 
OVER FOUR PER CENT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S 
DISAPPOINTED THAT THE STRIKE IS 
TAKING PLACE THE UNION ITSELF SAYS 
ALTHOUGH THERE WILL BE DISRUPTION 
IT'S NOR THE LONG TERM GOOD A A SEARCH IS UP THE WAY FOR A ROMAN 
CATHOLIC PRIEST WHO HAS GONE 
MISSING OFF THE COAST OF BRAZIL HE 
TOOK OFF ATTACHED TO ONE THOUSAND HELIUM 
BALLOONS TRYING TO BREAK A WORLD 
RECORD HE LEFT EQUIPPED A 
PARACHUTE TERMAL SUIT AND A G. P. S. 
DEVICE HE HAS NOT BEEN SEEN FOR 
THREE DAYS ENGLISH PEOPLE ARE 
BEING ENCOURAGED TO CELEBRATE THEIR 
SAINT'S DAY A REPORT HAS SAID THAT 
MORE PEOPLE CELEBRATE SAINT 
PATRICK'S'S DAY THAN SAINT GEORGE'S 
DAY WOMEN WHO CONSUME MORE 
CALORIES AND CEREAL ARE MORE LIKE 
TO CONCEIVE A BOY SCIENTISTS SAY 
WHAT A WOMAN EATS AROUND THE TIME 
OF CONCEPTION CAN INFLUENCE THE SEX 
OF THE BABY WHETHER YOUR BABEY IS 
A BOY OR GIRL IS MOSTLY DOWN TO 
CHANCE A NEW STUDY FOUND A LINK 
WITH A WOMAN'S DIET NOT DURING 
PREGNANCYS THANY BUT AROUND THE 
TIME SHE CONSEEED THOSE WHO ATE 
MORE AND HAD A HEALTHIER DIET HAD 
MORE BOYS AND SPECIALLY THOSE WHO 
ATE CEREAL FOR BREAKFAST MOST 
PARENTS ARE HAPPY TO HAVE A HEALTHY 
BABY BUT IF THEY COULD HAVE A 
SLIGHT PREFERENCE IT SEEMS 
ADJUSTING THE DIET COULD INFLUENCE 
THE OUTCOME WHAT DO MUMS MAKE OF 
IT 
I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER L. SEEM IT TO REMEMBER EATING QUITE A LOT AND 
I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED CEREALS THAT 
WOULD MEAN I WOULD HAVE A BOY BUT 
SHE IS A GIRL 
I WAS COUNCIL 
SEWELLING A LOT OF CALORIES I EAT A 
LOT OF CEREAL AND I HAVE A BOY 
IT'S NOT THE CASE FOR EVERYONE HERE 
BUT IT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE FOR ME 
THE SCIENTISTS SAY IT COULD EXPLAIN 
WHY BIRTHS ARE LOWER IN SOME 
COUNTRIES COUNTRIES OVER THE YEARS WOMAN ARE DECREASING 
THEIR CALORIE INTAKE AND THERE IS 
AN INCREASE IN UNHEALTHY EATING 
PATTERNS LIKE SKIPPING BREAKFAST 
HEALTHY EATING PATTERNS INCLUDING 
REGULAR BREAKFAST EATING SEEMS 
ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING BOYS 
MIDWIVES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
FINDINGS AND SAY A MUM'S HEALTHY 
DEET IS PARAMOUNT AND NOT CHOOSING 
THE SEX OF THE BABY THIS FROM 
CATHERINE IS THE FIRST LAW OF 
BIOLOGY THAT THE MALE DONATES THE X. 
OR Y. CHROMOSOME HOWEVER BREAKFAST 
IS GREAT FOR ALL PREGNANT WOMANS A 
WOMAN DOES NOT DETERMINE THE SEX OF 
HER BABY A MAN DOES HOWEVER AS 
MALE SPERM ARE WAERK THAN FEMALE 
SPERM IT SAYS HERE A HEALTHY 
ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM TO SWIM IN MAY 
GIVE THEM AN EDGE NO STOP IT A 
THREE MONTH B. B. C. INVESTIGATION INTO 
ONLINE CREDIT CARD FRAUD HAS 
REVEALED THAT IT'S MUCH MORE 
WIDESPREAD THAN OFFICIAL FIGURES 
SUGGEST RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT 
BANK ACCOUNT DETAILS CAN BE BOUGHT 
FOR AS LITTLE AS FIVER DAVID DAVIS 
HAS HAD HIS CREDIT CARD DETAILS 
STOLEN WHAT DID HE DO WHAT WHAT HAPPENED WAS THE BANKS CAUGHT IT 
SOMEONE TRIED TO USE MY CREDIT CARD 
BOTH IN BRITAIN AND IN AMERICA ON 
THE SAME DAY FOR TWO LARGE 
TRANSACTION IT SHOWED UP ON THE 
PROTECTION SOFTWARE THE BANK USES 
AND THEY NOTIFIED ME FORTUNATELY 
WE CAUGHT IT QUICKLY IT DOESN'T 
ALWAYS HAPPEN THAT WAY EVEN SO THE 
BANK WILL BE WELL OVER ONE THOUSAND OUT 
OF POCKET FOR ONE TRANSACTION 
DAVID DAVIS ANDREW GOODWILL IS A 
CREDIT CARD FRAUD EXPERT THAT FOR 
COMING IN L. GATHER HAVE YOU BEEN A VICTIM 
I HAVE INDEED A FEW YEARS VICTIM AGO MY CREDIT CARD WAS STOLE 
FOREIGN ONLINE GAMING IN AMERICA 
IT WAS USED TO GO ON WEBSITES WHERE 
YOU ARE LOSING MONEY 
IT WAS USED 
TO GAMBLE WITH 
BUT YOU ARE THE 
EXPERT IN CREDIT CARD ONLINE FRAUD 
I KNOW 
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN L. HAVE 
I HAVE NO IDEA L. NOTICED THE TRANSACTION 
ON MY STATEMENT DIDN'T RECOGNISE 
IT RANG UP THE CARD COMPANY AND 
SAID WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT THEY 
WERE LITTLE BEMUSED THEY LOOKED 
INTO IT AND SAID WE THINK IT MIGHT 
NOT BE YOU SAID LET ME TELL YOU 
THE JOB I DO THEY SAID IT PROBABLY 
WASN'T YOU 
IT'S A THEME WE KEEP 
COMING BACK TO YET THERE SEEMS TO 
BE MO CENTRAL HUB FROM THE PACKAGE 
WE HAD EARLIER WHEN SOMEONE HAD A 
PROBLEM POLICE WEREN'T INTERESTED 
THEY ARE NOT THERE SEEMS TO BE 
LACK OF POLITICAL WILL TO 
INVESTIGATE THIS TYPE OF CRIME 
MAINLY BECAUSE IT'S A TECHNICAL 
CRIME AND IT REQUIRES SKILLS TO 
INVESTIGATE AND IT ALSO COST LOT 
OF MONEY 
HOW DO PEOPLE GET HOLD OF 
YOUR CREDIT CARD DETAILS IS IT JUST 
THAT YOU ARE PUTTING THEM ONLINE 
WHEN YOU GO TO SHOPPING SITES OR 
ARE PEOPLE SWIPING THEM IN SHOPS 
IT'S NUMEROUS DIFFERENT WAYS THEY 
ARE COMING FROM CALL CENTRES WHERE 
YOU GIVE YOUR DETAILS OVER THE 
TELEPHONE TO A CALL CENTRE TO BUY 
SOMETHING OR THROUGH AN INTERNET 
SITE WHERE YOU HAVE BOUGHT 
SOMETHING AND THEIR DATA BASE MAY 
BE INSECURE AND HACKERS HAVE HACKED 
IN THERE AGAIN THE DETAILS THAT 
WAY IS THERE WAY THAT WE ARE 
ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT HOW PEOPLE CAN 
PROTECT THEMSELVES WHAT DO 
GOVERNMENT POLICE OTHER 
AUTHORITIES ACTUALLY DO TO CLAMP 
DOWN 
THE BACHING INDUSTRY ARE DOING 
SECURE SYSTEMS VERIFIED BY VISA 
AND THAT DOES HELP BUT ALSO THE 
FRAUDSTERS HAVE FOUND WAYS OF USING 
THAT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE IF YOU 
HAVEN'T REGISTERED YOUR CARD FOR THREE D. 
SECURE TIS CHOOSING A PASS WORD TO 
CHOOSE ONLINE THE FRAUDSTERS IF 
THEY GET YOUR DETAILS WILL CHOOSE 
A PASS WORD FOR YOU AND THAT WILL 
THEN SECURE ALL THE CREDIT LIMIT ON 
THAT CARD FOR THE FRAUDSTER ANY ANY SHOPPING SITE YOU YOU GO TO MAKE 
SURE YOU HAVE A PASS WORD WHEN YOU 
PUT IN YOUR DETAILS 
YES YOU CAN 
SIGN UP TO THREE D. SECURE 
IS IT CHEAP 
IT'S FREE BUT IT IS ANOTHER PASS 
WORD AND IT IS ANOTHER SECURITY 
THING YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER EVERY 
PERSON THAT 
DO S. 
A TRANSACTION 
ONLINE HAS RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY 
IT AS PART OF THAT TRANSACTION SO 
YOU HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT THINGS 
LIKE DO YOU KNOW THE COMPANY YOU 
ARE BUYING FROM 
THIS PROBLEM ABOUT 
CALL CENTRES IS WORRYING HOW DO 
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GIVE YOUR DETAILS 
OVER THE PHONE THEY ARE GOING TO BE 
SECURE 
YOU DON'T AND THAT IS IT SECURE IT IS ALL DOWN TO TRUST 
IT IS DOWN TO 
TRUST A LOT OF CALL CENTRES ARE 
HELD ABROAD WITH PEOPLE WHO LIVE 
ABROAD AND NOT REGULATED BY RULES 
AND REGULATIONS AND LAWS IN THIS 
COUNTRY IT IS A COMPLICATED THING 
THE BEST THING TO DO IS BE 
RESPONSIBLE IN HOW YOU SPEND MONEY 
ONLINE MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHO YOU 
ARE BUYING FROM MAKE SURE IT IS 
NOT A BOGUS COMPANY YOU CAN LOOK 
UP A LOT OF COMPANIES ON GOOGLE 
DON'T BE GUIDED BY THE PRICE EITHER 
IF IT IS A HALF PRICE NINTENDO WII 
YOU WANT TO BE WORRYING WHY IS IT 
HALF PRICE 
KEEP CHECKING YOUR 
STATEMENTS 
DEFINITELY BUT I THINK STATEMENTS ALSO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS THE 
POLICE NEED TO START TO REACT TO 
THIS AND START TO DO SOME POLICING 
ON IT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE 
DAY THE RETAILER IS THE PERSON 
THAT SUFFERS THE RISK THEY SUFFER 
THE LOSS NOT THE BANKS SO THE 
BARNINGS COME OUT AND SAY LAST YEAR 
IT WAS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION THAT WERE LOST 
AND THEY MAKE IT SOUND AS THOUGH IT 
WAS ACTUALLY THE BANKS THAT LOST IT 
IT WAS BUSINESS THAT LOST IT 
LET'S TELL YOU WHAT'S COMING UP ON 
BREAKFAST LATER ELVIS FANS THIS 
MORNING ARE ALL SHOOK UP AFTER 
CLAIMS THE KING SEEK RITLY VISITED 
LONDON FIFTY YEARS AGO WE WILL SEE 
HOW HE MAY HAVE SPENT THE DAY 
COURTNEY PINE WILL BE HERE TO TELL 
US HOW HE WAS INSPIRED FOR HIS 
LATEST WORK WE HAVE EARTHA KITT 
JOINING US TO SHARE THE SECRET OF 
HER ENDURING APPEAL 
YOU WERE HERE LAST TIME WITH 
EARTHA KITT SHOULD I BE NERVOUS 
SHE LOOKED DERMOT IT WILL BE QUITE 
ENTERTAINING 
GOOD MORNING TO YOU HAPPY SAINT 
GEORGE'S DAY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
DAY FOR SOME OF US COMPARED WITH 
YESTERDAY THERE WILL BE SOME 
SUNSHINE TOWARDS THE WEST THIS 
MORNING ACROSS MANY PARTS OF THE 
COUNTRY THERE WILL BE SOME RAIN FOR 
A TIME 
WE ARE AT LONG LAST STARTING TO GET 
AIR IN FROM THE ATLANTIC SO NOT AS 
CHILLY AS WE HAVE SEEN OF LATE BUT 
WITH THAT COMES THE THREAT OF SOME 
WEATHER FRONTS MOVING IN AND THAT 
BAND OF CLOUD IS ALREADY PRODUCING 
RAIN THE RAIN PUSHING IN ACROSS 
WESTERN SCOTLAND AT THE MOMENT 
MUCH OF NORTH WEST ENGLAND 
MIDLANDS DOWN TOWARDS THE LONDON 
AREA HEAVIER BUSTS FOR A TIME BUT 
IT WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH ITS WAY 
EASTWARDS AND SKIES BRIGHTENING 
BEHIND THE SUNSHINE WILL MAKE IT 
FEEL WARM ONCE 
STILL A BIT OF CLOUD FROM KENT TO 
THE EAST OF LONDON AND RUNNING UP 
THE EASTERN COAST OF ENGLAND 
NORTH WEST ENGLAND IT WILL BRIGHTEN 
UP SOME SUNSHINE THIS AFTERNOON 
TEMPERATURES UP TO AROUND SIXTEEN 
DEGREES DEGREES THIRTEEN IN WESTERN SCOTLAND ONCE THE SUN 
COMES OUT BUT EASTERN HALF OF 
SCOTLAND IT WILL REMAIN CLOUDY WITH 
FURTHER SPELLS OF RAIN 
FOR NORTHERN IRELAND A LOVELY DAY 
WE HAVE LOST THE RAIN HERE IT 
SHOULD STAY DRY FOR MUCH OF THE DAY 
WITH TEMPERATURES AROUND SIXTEEN CELSIUS 
AND IT SHOULD BE FINE FOR MUCH OF 
WALES AND THE SOUTH WEST 
WINDS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TODAY 
MAINLY LIGHT COMING FROM A GENERAL 
SOUTHERLY DIRECTION 
THROUGH THIS EVENING WE LOSE THE 
RAIN FROM THE EAST COAST OF ENGLAND 
AND SCOTLAND RAIN PUSHES IN 
TOWARDS THE WEST AGAIN ACROSS 
NORTHERN IRELAND WALES AND THE 
SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND IT 
SHOULD BE MILD NIGHT WITH 
TEMPERATURES WELL ABOVE FREEZING 
TOMORROW SIMILAR TO TODAY SOME 
HEAVIER BURSTS AROUND SUNSHINE IN 
THE WEST LATER ON BUT THERE WILL BE 
ONE OR TWO HEAVY SHOWERS 
THE HOLLYWOOD ACT ACTOR EWAN 
MCGREGOR HAS BEEN PRAISED BY CANCER 
CHARITIES AFTER HE TOLD BREAKFAST 
HE HAD BEEN TREATED FOR SKIN CANCER 
HE TOLD OUR REPORTER HE HAD BEEN TO 
SEE HIS DOCTOR TO CHECK ON MOLES 
UNDER HIS EYE 
I I WENT TO HAVE 
THEM CHECKED YOU HAVE TO BE 
CAREFUL IF YOU ARE PALE SKIN AND 
YOU SPEND TIME IN THE SUN WITH 
MOLES THE SPECIALIST THOUGHT THEY 
WOULD BE BETTER TO BE REMOVED AND 
HE WAS CORRECT 
DOCTOR ROSEMARY IS HERE 
I HAD TWO MEN COME INTO THE SURGERY 
YESTERDAY SAYING EWAN MCGREGOR HAD 
HIS SKIN CHECKED I WANT TO BE 
CHECKED WITH THE NASTIEST FORM OF 
SKIN CANCER THOUGH IT IS MORE 
COMMON IN WOMEN THIS IS MALIGNANT 
MELANOMA MORE MEN DIE OF IT THAN 
WOMEN BECAUSE THEY THEY GO TO THEIR 
DOCTORS LATER 
A LOT OF PEOPLE 
BROUGHT UP IN SUNNY CLIMBS ARE 
GROWING UP BY THE BEACH ON THE 
COAST HAVE MOLES SHOULD THEY ALL 
GO TO THEIR DOCTORS TO GET CHECKED 
OUT 
EVERYBODY NEEDS TO CHECK THEIR OUT SKIN IF YOU HAVE GOT JUST MOLES 
YOU DON'T NEED TO GO TO YOUR DOCTOR 
BUT IF YOU HAVE MOLES THAT ARE 
CHANGING COLOUR THAT ARE CHANGING 
SHAPE AND PARTICULARLY LARGER MOLES 
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO COVER AN 
ORDINARY MOLE WITH THE END OF A 
PENCIL 
WHICH END 
THE SPECIALISTS PENCIL SAY A PENCIL AT THE RUBBER AT THE 
END IF YOU HAVE MOLE THAT IS 
BIGGER THAN THE END OF A PENCIL AND 
IT IS GETTING BIGGER AND HAS 
IRREGULAR PIGMENTATION ODD EDGE OR 
IF IT IS ITCHY THAT TYPE OF MOLE 
SHOULD BE CHECKED OUT OR IF YOU 
HAVE FOR MEN PARTICULARLY SCALY 
PATCHES ON YOUR FOREHEAD OR ON THE 
SCALP FOR MEN WHO ARE THINNER ON 
TOP SCALY PATCHES THAT ARE NOT 
HEALING THEY SHOULD BE CHECKED OUT 
HOW LONG CAN YOU LEAVE THESE THINGS 
FOR 
IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF SKIN FOR CANCER IF YOU HAVE PIGMENTED MOLES 
THEY NEED TO BE SEEN AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE PERSISTENT SCALY PATCHES 
ON THE FACE OR HEAD THEY CAN BE 
LEFT LONGER WITH ALL THESE TYPES 
OF THINGS GO SOONER RATHER THAN 
LATER HAS TO BE THE MESSAGE 
I HAVE 
HAD ONE TAKEN OFF MY LEG IT'S VERY 
SIMPLE PROCEDURE DONE UNDER LOCAL 
ANAESTHETIC BEST TO GET THEM OUT 
MELANOMA IS MORE COMMON ON THE 
BACKS OF MEN SO YOU NED TO GET 
SOMEBODY TO CHECK YOUR BACK 
THE INCREASING PROBLEM OF POACHING 
IS BEING ADDRESSED BY THE NATIONAL 
CRIME WILDLIFE UNIT 
THEY ARE 
WORRIED GANGS OF POACHERS ARE GET 
ARE MORE ORGANISED AND THEY ARE 
ENDANGERING SOME SPECIES IN THE 
WILD 
GOOD MORNING FROM THE RIVER TYNE 
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SALMON 
RIVERS IN THE COUNTRY AND IT DOES 
SUFFER WITH THE PROBLEM DURING THE 
SEASON OF PEOPLE PUTTING NETS IN 
THE RIVER AND TAKING OUT WILD 
SALMON WHICH COMMAND A HIGHER 
PREMIUM THAN FARMED ONES THEY CAN 
TAKE SEVEN HUNDRED WORTH OF SALMON OUT OF 
THE RIVER HERE AT A TIME ACROSS 
THE U. K. THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS ARE 
KILLED AND TAKEN FROM THE WILD 
ILLEGALLY EACH YEAR AND SOLD ON FOR 
PROFIT I HAVE BEEN ON ONE ANTI 
POACHING OPERATION IN CUMBRIA 
LATE AT NIGHT NEAR HAWKS HEAD IN 
THE LAKE DISFRICT DISTRICT THIS 
IS HOW HOW POACHERS WORK CATCH A 
DEER STAG STAG IN THE BEAM OF 
LAMP AND THEY CAN START BEHAVING 
LIKE A TAME ANIMAL THIS DEER HAS 
ALMOST WALKED RIGHT UP TO THE LIGHT 
A POACHER WOULD SEND A DOG DOWN THE 
BEAM OR USE A RIFLE THIS STAG IS 
LUCKY THE LAMP HOLDER IS POLICEMAN 
THE OLD ROMANTIC IMAGE POLICEMAN OF A GUY LIVING IN A COUNTRY WITH A 
FAMILY ON A LOW WAGE NIPPING OUT 
TO THE FIELDS AT NIGHT GETTING A 
PHEASANT TO FEED HIS FAMILY ISN'T 
TRUE THESE PEOPLE ARE IN IT FOR 
MONEY AND FOR WHAT THEY WOULD CALL 
SPORT I WOULDN'T CALL IT SPORT WE WE WERE OUT ON AN ANTI POACHING 
OPERATION FOLLOWING A BRIEFING 
EARLIER IN THE EVENING 
WE ARE 
GOING TO DO THE SAME AS WE NORMALLY 
DO WHICH IS PEOPLE GOING OUT TO 
THE PLACES THAT THEY HAVE SELECTED 
TO REPORT ANY ILLEGAL ACTIVITY 
GAMEKEEPERS AND LANDOWNERS WERE 
TAKING PART TRYING TO TACKLE A 
GROWING PROBLEM 
I RASHED IT AS AS 
STEALING IT IS ARMED ROBBERY IF 
SOMEBODY CAME INTO YOUR HOUSE WITH 
A GUN AND NICKED YOUR TELEVISION 
IT IS AN ARMED ROB ROBBERY L. CAN'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE 
A FEW HOURS LATER THE WATCHING PAYS 
OFF BUT FINDING THE SUSPICIOUS CAR 
IN A MAZE OF COUNTRY LANES IS 
DIFFICULT 
IT IS 
WITHIN MINUTES THE DIFFICULT NETWORK OF WATCHERS GETS RESULT 
THE SUSPICIOUS PICK UP TURNS OUT TO 
BE A LOCAL FARMER 
I THOUGHT 
SOMEBODY WAS AFTER MY DEER IN THE 
BOTTOM FIELDS 
WE ARE LOOKING FOR A 
DOUBLE CAB PICK UP 
IT WAS ME 
PROBABLY 
IT PROVES THE SYSTEM PROBABLY WORKS NEXT TIME YOU GO OUT LAMPING 
GIVE US A RING TONIGHT'S OPERATION 
IS NOW WINDING DOWN BUT EVEN 
THOUGH NO POACHERS HAVE BEEN CAUGHT 
IT IS REGARDED AS A SUCCESS 
BECAUSE THERE IS A FEELING THAT THE 
WORD IS OUT THAT POACHING IS BEING 
TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS A PROBLEM HERE 
IN CUMBRIA 
WHETHER THAT MEANS THE PROBLEM IS 
JUST MOVED ON ISN'T YET CLEAR BUT 
AT LEAST THESE DEER ARE BEING 
AFFORDED SOME PROTECTION 
THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE CRIME UNIT 
ACTUALLY HAVE PRIORITY CRIMES THEY 
WANT PEOPLE TO TACKLE EVERY YEAR 
AND ONE OF THEM THIS YEAR IS 
POACHING AND THEY WANT TO SEE A 
CLEAR STRATEGY RIGHT ACROSS THE U. K. 
OF DEALING WITH THIS SORT OF 
PROBLEM HERE ON THE RIVER TYNE 
YOU HAVE WILD SALMON IN THE RIVER 
AND ON THIS STRETCH IT IS RATHER 
NOTORIOUS AT TIMES FOR POACHING 
GANGS COMING OUT AND TRYING TO TAKE 
SALMON FROM THE RIVER IT IS SUCH A 
PROBLEM THAT YOU FIND THE 
ENVIRONMENT AGENCY OFFICIALS 
WEARING STAB VESTS AND CARRYING 
HANDCUFFS ACTUALLY TO CARRY OUT 
ARRESTS ON THIS STRETCH IT IS A 
PROBLEM THAT SEEMS TO BE NATIONWIDE 
WE HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF E. MAILS 
ABOUT THIS 
I SPENT A LOT OF NIGHTS POACHER 
WATCHING UNTIL FOUR HUNDRED IN THE MORNING 
THERE IS AN ANONYMOUS TEXT SAYING I 
WOULD LIKE TO DISAGREE THAT ALL 
POACHERS ARE CRIMINALS L. AM ON A 
LOW WAGE AND WILL OCCASIONALLY

GOOD MORNING 
IT WASN'T A GREAT SPECTACLE BUT 
AFTER NINETY MINUTES THE TIE BETWEEN 
LIVERPOOL AND CHELSEA IS STILL 
BEAUTIFULLY BALANCED 
IT FINISHED ONE TO ONE BUT CHELSEA WILL 
HAVE THE SLIGHT PSYCHOLOGICAL 
ADVANTAGE WITH THAT AWAY GOAL 
THANKS TO A LATE EQUALISER 
IT PROMISED TO BE ANOTHER THRILLING 
NIGHT AT ANFIELD EVEN LIVERPOOL'S 
CONTROVERSIAL CO OWNER TOM HICKS 
WAS IN GOOD VOICE WELL SORT OF 
AND THE HOME FANS HAD PLENTY TO 
SING ABOUT WHEN DIRK KUYT SQUIRMED 
FREE IN THE FORTY THIRD MINUTE TO FIRE 
LIVERPOOL IN FRONT 
CHELSEA HAD PLENTY OF POSSESSION 
BUT MADE FEW CHANCES AND IT TOOK A 
COUPLE OF EXCELLENT SAVES FROM PETR 
CECH TO PREVENT LIVERPOOL FROM 
ADDING TO THEIR SCORE 
BUT IN THE FIFTH MINUTE OF EXTRA 
TIME THE TIE WAS TURNED ON IT'S 
HEAD HEAD SALOMAN KALOU'S CROSS WAS TURNED 
INTO HIS OWN NET BY JOHN ARNE RIISE 
THAT CRUCIAL AWAY GOAL MEANS THAT 
LIVERPOOL MUST NOW SCORE AT 
STAMFORD BRIDGE IN THE SECOND LEG 
A FEAT THEY HAVEN'T ACHIEVED IN 
EIGHT ATTEMPTS 
IT'S MANCHESTER UNITED'S TURN 
TONIGHT TONIGHT THEY'RE AT THE NOU CAMP FOR THE

ANDY MURRAY WON FOR THE SECOND DAY 
RUNNING UP AGAINST ITALY'S 
FILLIPPO VOLANDRI AT THE MONTE 
CARLO MASTERS HE PULLED OFF A 
STRAIGHT SETS WIN HIS SECOND ROUND 
MATCH MATCH IT WASN'T PERHAPS AN ALTOGETHER 
CONVINCING DISPLAY FROM THE BRITISH 
NUMBER ONE 
BUT HE MANAGED A SINGLE BREAK OF 
SERVE TO TAKE THE FIRST SET 
VOLANDRI THEN FELL APART IN THE 
SECOND AS MURRAY WON IT SIX TO FOUR SIX TO ONE 
BUT HE FACES A MORE DIFFICULT TASK 
IN HIS NEXT MATCH HE'S UP AGAINST 
THE NUMBER THREE SEED NOVAK 
DJOKOVIC 
AND YOU KNOW THE SAYING TRY TRY 
AND TRY AGAIN IF YOU FIRST DON'T 
SUCCEED WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
ROBERT DEE WHO IS THE WORLD'S WORST 
TENNIS PLAYER HE HAS LOST FIFTY FOUR 
MATCHES IN A ROW WITHOUT WINNING A 
SINGLE SET BUT HE WON HIS FIFTY FIFTH 
MATCH HOWEVER HE LOST THE NEXT 
ONE BUT HOPEFULLY THIS IS THE 
START OF GREAT THINGS TO COME YOU YOU SEE EVEN ONE IN EVERY FIFTY FIVE MATCHES 
IS BETTER THAN WE CAN PRODUCE 
EXACTLY HE'S ONE THOUSAND FORTY FOURTH IN THE WORLD 
BUT WINNING IS BREEDING THING 
AND AS THE OLD SONG GOES THINGS 
CAN ONLY GET BETTER 
EXACTLY GOOD 
LUCK TO HIM 
WE'VE ALL HEARD THE 
PHRASE YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT NOW 
IT SEEMS WHAT YOU EAT DETERMINES 
WHAT SEX YOUR CHILDREN ARE 
APPARENTLY IT LIES NOT IN THE 
CHROMOSOMES BUT IN YOUR CORNFLAKES 
THOSE WHO EAT CEREALS ARE MORE 
LIKELY TO HAVE A BOY IN FOLK LOWER 
THERE HAVE BEEN ALL SORTS OF TALES 
OVER HOW TO GET A BOY FOR INSTANCE 
EAT MORE RED MEAT AND SALT AND DADS 
NEED TO DRINK MORE KOLA TO HAVE A 
GIRL MUMS NEED TO EAT MORE FISH 
AND CHOCOLATE AND CONCEIVE IN THE 
SAME MONTH AS MUM'S BIRTHDAY 
KATIE BREATHWICK AND LARA GREEN 
JOIN US KATIE NOT ONLY DO YOU 
HAVE TWO BOYS YOU ARE ONE OF 
MULTIPLE BOYS 
WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHT 
IN THE FAMILY 
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN 
LOTS OF CEREAL 
I SPOKE TO MY 
MOTHER AND MOTHER IN LAW LAST NIGHT 
AND MY MOTHER CAN'T REMEMBER BUT 
THINKS SHE WAS PROBABLY EATING A 
COOKED BREAKFAST BEFOREHAND AND MY 
MOTHER IN LAW SAYS SHE WAS VERY 
SICK AND WAS PROBABLY EXISTING ON 
COFFEE AND FAGS WHAT CAN WE LEARN 
FROM THAT 
IT DOES SEEM BIT ODD DOESN'T IT IT DOES AND THERE ARE PROBABLY 
LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THINKING 
OH IT'S LOAD OF TOSH AND 
THEY'VE HEARD 
IT ALL BEFORE ISN'T ISN'T IT DOWN TO THE X. AND Y. CHROMOSOME 
YES BUT ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT 
THE DETAIL THERE IS SOMETHING IN IT 
AND IT SHOULD NOT BE DISMISSED 
EASILY AND THE WOMEN WHO HAD BOYS 
HAD A HIGHER LEVEL OF GLUCOSE IN 
THEIR BODIES AND THEY HAD A MORE 
VARIED DIET GENERALLY 
BUT SHOULDN'T WE JUST ADD IT TO THE 
LIST OF OTHER THINGS WE'VE HEARD 
YES THERE ARE SO MANY THEORIES OUT 
THERE AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRYING 
TO DETERMINE IT IF 
YOU WANT GIRL YOU PUT A WOODEN SPOON UNDER THE 
BED OR FOR A BOY TRY TO CONCEIVE 
ON AN ODD DAY IN THE MONTH BUT FOR 
A GIRL AN EVEN DAY THERE ARE 
THOUSANDS OF THEORIES OUT THERE 
AND FOR MANY THIS COULD BE JUST 
ANOTHER THEORY BUT WE SHOULD LOOK 
AT IT IN MORE DETAIL PERHAPS AND AND PERHAPS THE HEALTH OF THE WOMAN 
IF A WOMAN HAS EATEN WELL OR 
CERTAIN FOODS 
I THINK PERHAPS 
THERE MIGHT BE AN INDICATION THAT 
IF YOU HAVE A SWEET TOOTH AND THERE 
IS MORE GLUCOSE IN THE BODY THAT 
MIGHT ENCOURAGE BOYS TO GROW AND I 
CAN VOUCH FOR THAT 
A DOCTOR HAS 
WRITTEN IN TO EXPRESS THAT EXACTLY EXACTLY BUT I HAVE TO SAY I BELIEVE IT IS 
ALL DOWN TO SPERM L. THINK YOU 
MARRY THE MAN AND THAT MAN GIVES 
YOU WHAT YOU GET 
BUT YOU CAN'T DO 
WITHOUT OUR SPERM CAN YOU 
UNFORTUNATELY NOT 
AND THIS ONE WERE SUSIE SAYS IF 
YOU WANT A GIRL GET YOUR HUSBAND TO 
GO SCUBA DIVING IT'S SOMETHING TO 
DO WITH 
THE OXYGEN IN THE TANK 
AND AND THE TIGHT WET SUIT AND THIS ONE SAYS IT'S A LOAD OF 
RUBBISH MEN HOLD THE KEY TO THE 
SEX OF THE BABY IF YOU WANT A BOY 
CONCEIVE AROUND THE TIME OF THE 
WOMAN'S OVULATION WHEN THE EGG IS 
THERE AS MALE SPERM IS FAST 
SWIMMERS IF YOU WANT A GIRL TRY 
FEW DAYS AFTER OVATION AS THAT 
SPERM IS SLOWER 
JUST BEFORE A HAD 
A BOY I WAS SILENTLY AND SECRETLY 
SLIPPED A COPY OF HOW TO INFLUENCE 
THE SEX OF YOUR CHILD AND I HAVE 
NEVER EVER TOLD ANYBODY THAT I HAD 
THIS BOOK BEFORE AND THAT WAS THE 
SAME THEORY THAT YOU TIME WHEN YOU 
HAVE SEX BUT IT IS ONE OF THOSE 
THINGS YOU NEVER DISCUSS NOBODY 
ADMITS TO TRYING TO INFLUENCE THE 
GENDER OF THEIR CHILD 
DO YOU BUY 
IT AT ALL 
IN TERMS OF THE RESEARCH 
THAT HAS BEEN DONE 
OR THE TIMING 
I THINK YOU CAN BELIEVE ANYTHING 
YOU WANT TO WE USUALLY SAY YOU 
HAVE FIFTY PER CENT CHANCE OF ONE OR THE OTHER OTHER I HAVE HAD THREE BOYS LOOK AT ENDY 
FROM ESSEX SHE HAS EIGHT SHE 
WANTS GIRL AND HAD EIGHT SONS 
WE ARE WONDERING WHETHER SHE WILL 
NOW STOP NOT HAVING HAD A GIRL OR 
JUST KEEP GOING 
SHE MUST BE 
EXHAUSTED 
MUSTN'T SHE SHE MUST EXHAUSTED HAVE EATEN A LOT OF CEREAL 
IT IS KIND OF HEARTENING THAT WITH 
ALL THE ADVANCES WE HAVE IN 
MEDICINE IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WE 
STILL HAVEN'T WORKED IT OUT WE WE HAVEN'T BUT PERHAPS THIS RESEARCH 
HAS LOCATED PERHAPS A SLIGHT LINK 
BETWEEN DIET AND THE SEX OF THE 
BABY BUT I THINK A WHOLE LOT MORE 
RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE DONE TO 
CONFIRM THAT 
LAURA SAYS SHE IS A VEGETARIAN BUT 
EATS FISH AND CHOCOLATE AND SHE HAD 
A BABY BOY I EAT FISH AND 
CHOCOLATE AND I DON'T EAT RED MEAT 
AND I HAVE THREE BOYS 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE OR THE OTHER 
HE WAS THE KING OF ROCK'N'ROLL AND 
LOVED THE WORLD OVER FOR HIS MUSIC 
AND PROBABLY THE MOST RECOGNISABLE 
STAR OF HIS DAY SO YOU WOULD HAVE 
THOUGHT THAT SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE 
ROLLINGED HIM IF ELVIS VISITED 
LONDON UNTIL NOW IT IS THOUGHT HE 
ONLY MADE ONE BRIEF STOP AT PRESTIC 
AIRPORT PRESTWICK AIRPORT IN HIS 
TIME BUT NOW THERE IS A CLAIM HE 
SPENT A DAY IN LONDON SOME PEOPLE 
ARE ALL SHOOK UP ABOUT THIS CLAIM 
BUT FIRSTLY LET'S LOOK AT WHAT 
TRIP TO LONDON FOR ELVIS MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN LIKE 
ONE NIGHT WITH YOU 
IS WHAT I'M NOW PRAYING FOR 
THE THINGS THAT WE PLANNED 
WOULD MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE 
JUST CALL MY NAME 
AND I'LL BE RIGHT BY YOUR SIDE 
I WANT YOUR SWEET HELPING HAND 
MY LOVE'S TOO STRONG TO HIDE 
ALL WE'VE LIVED 
YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED HIM 
WOULDN'T YOU 
AND JULIE YEARDYE AND IAN KOULSON 
AN ELVIS MSPERNATER JOIN US 
NOBODY THINKS THAT HE DID TOP 
REALLY TOMMY WORKS FOR ME AND 
TOMMY GOT A PHONE CALL ONE NIGHT 
THEY TOLD ME YOU'RE GOOD WHO IS 
THIS IT'S ELVIS HE SAID SAID 
ARE YOU AS GOOD AS ME AND THEY 
GOT A FRIENDSHIP AND ELVIS FLEW IN 
FOR A DAY AND ELVIS FLEW OVER AND 
THEY SPENT DAY TOGETHER 
YOU LOOK SCEPTICAL WHAT DO YOU 
RECKON 
I THINK IT IS SPECK LAYING RECKON SPECULATION I DON'T THINK IT IS 
TRUE ELVIS WAS IN GERMANY AND THE 
ONLY TIME HE WAS GRANTED LEAVE WAS 
TO GO TO PARIS WHICH HE DID IN A 
LIMOUSINE WITH A GUY CALLED REX 
FROM THE ARMY 
SO THERE WAS NO WAY HE COULD HAVE 
SNUCK IN TRIP TO LONDON 
THE MOST 
PHOTOGRAPHED MAN IN HISTORY I 
DON'T THINK SO 
ELVIS LIKED TO BE SEEN HE LIKED TO 
MET HIS FANS A COUPLE OF TIMES 
ELVIS DID GO IN DISGUISE BUT WENT 
AS LAURENCE OF ARABIA HE WAS BIG 
AND LOUD NO MATTER WHAT HE WORE 
I CAN'T IMAGINE IT SOMEHOW IT IS 
WONDERFUL THOUGHT YOU SHOULD HAVE 
TOMMY STEELE NOW TELLING YOU THIS 
STORY STORY WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT ELVIS DID 
COME OVER FOR ONE DAY MAYBE AS IAN 
SAID HE ONLY WENT TO PARIS AND 
FRANKFURT TO SEE BILL HAYLEY AND 
THE COMETS 
TOMMY KEEPS QUIET ABOUT THAT THING 
WOULD YOU 
HE WAS TOLD THAT IT 
SHOULD BE A SECRET 
ELVIS DIDN'T DIDN'T WANT IT 
REVEALED REVEALED YOU WOULD THINK THAT ELVIS WHO 
WASN'T RETICENT ABOUT THESE THINGS 
WOULD HAVE MENTIONED THAT HE HAD 
BEEN TO BRITAIN MORE THAN ONCE 
HE KNEW HOW BIG A FAN BASE HE HAD 
OVER HERE HE WOULD HAVE MADE LOT 
OF NOISE ABOUT THIS AND ELVIS HAD 
BIG ENTOURAGE AROUND HIM AND TOOK 
HIS FATHER AND GRANDMOTHER TO 
TEGENEROANY AND GERMANY WITH THEM 
WE CONTACTED TOMMY STEELE AND HE 
SAID HE PROMISED HE WAS MAKING NO 
FURTHER COMMENT BUT PROMISED THAT 
HE WOULD KEEP THE TRIP A SECRET AND 
HE REGRETTED THAT IT HAD BEEN MADE 
PUBLIC PRESTWICK AIRPORT ARE 
SAYING WE NEED TO SEE PHOTOGRAPHIC 
EVIDENCE BECAUSE PEOPLE HANG ON IF 
YOU HAVE ANY CONNECTION WITH ELVIS 
YOU WANT TO HANG ON TO IT ELVIS ELVIS COULDN'T BLOW HIS NOSE WITHOUT IT 
BEING PHOTOGRAPHED ALL THE 
PRESTWICK STUFF IS DOCUMENTED ALL 
THE SECRET HOLIDAYS IN HAWAII 
YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE AS ELVIS 
I WORK 
FOR ELVISLY YOURS WHICH IS A 
MEMORABILIA SHOP AND WE GET 
HUNDREDS OF STORIES EVERY WEEK 
TELLING US STORIES ABOUT ELVIS AND 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HEARD 
THIS ONE 
VIEWER GOT IN TOUCH AND 
SAID THEY WORKED FOR H. M. V. IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT 
AND ELVIS'S VISIT WAS A POPULAR 
RUMOUR AND FEW WERE INTERESTED 
BECAUSE HE WASN'T THAT POPULAR AT 
THE TIME 
HAD HE HAD MANY NUMBER ONES BY 
THEN 
YES SEVERAL AND FOUR MOVIES THEN UNDER HIS BELT HE WAS A BIG STAR 
A LOT OF THE PRESS AT THE TIME 
CONSIDERED ROCK'N'ROLL SOMETHING AS 
A FAD THAT IT WOULD BE OVER 
WHEN OTHER AMERICAN STARS CAME TO 
BRITAIN A LOT OF THE BRITISH PRESS 
DIDN'T COVER IT BECAUSE THEY 
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE OVER SOON AND 
LITTLE DID THEY KNOW 
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT ELVIS 
INSPIRES DEVOTION AND TALK AND I 
MEAN SO MANY WERE DEVOTING THEIR 
LIVES TO HIM WHAT IS IT ABOUT HIM 
WELL HE IS AN ICON HE WAS ONE OF 
THE FIRST WELL HE WAS THE FIRST 
BIG MASSIVE ROCK'N'ROLL STAR THE 
FIRST GUY TO GO UNPLUGGED 
I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS SO 
TALENTED AND LET'S FACE IT HE WAS 
KIND OF SO GOOD LOOKING AS WELL 
CAN YOU DO A BIT OF ELVIS BEFORE 
YOU GO 
SURE THING ANY ONE YOU 
WANT WANT ANY ONE YOU WANT 
ALL SHOOK UP 
MY FRIENDS SAY I'M ACTING AS WILD 
AS A BUG 
I'M ALL SHOOK UP 
I'M ALL SHOOK UP 
YEAH ELVIS IS 
LEAVING THE BUILDING 
I'M GOING TO HAVE A CUP OF TEA 
FIRST FIRST THANK YOU 
THANK YOU AFTER WE GET THE WEATHER FROM MATT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH BILL 
THE WEATHER IS TAKING A SHAKE 
THROUGH THE NIGHT A DIFFERENT DAY 
FOR SOME OF US COMPARED WITH THE 
LOVELY CONDITIONS OF YESTERDAY 
WHERE WE SAW TWENTY ONE CELSIUS IN 
SOUTHAMPTON DURING THE AFTERNOON 
AS YOU CAN GUESS BY ME WITH THE 
UMBRELLA THERE WILL BE RAIN AROUND 
THIS MORNING IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE 
THE RAIN IT HAS BEEN PUSHING IN 
OFF THE ATLANTIC IT HAS CLEARED 
AWAY FROM NORTHERN IRELAND WALES 
AND THE SOUTH WEST YOU CAN SEE THE 
BAND OF CLOUD AND THE SATELLITE 
PICTURE THERE THAT'S WHERE THE 
RAIN IS COMING FROM IT HAS BEEN 
SLOWLY PUSHING EASTWARDS THE ODD 
HEAVIER BURSTS AROUND AND FOR THE 
NEXT HOUR OR TWO IT WILL EXTEND 
FROM GLASGOW THROUGH MANCHESTER 
TOWARDS LONDON AND KENT 
TO THE EAST OF THAT WE HAVE FOG 
AROUND IT WILL LIFT AND CLEAR AS 
THE CLOUD AND THE RAIN MOVES IN 
BUT IT WILL REMAIN MURKY 
AT FOUR HUNDRED P. M. THE BRIGHTER SKIES IN THE 
WEST WILL HAVE MADE IT THROUGH THE 
MIDLANDS CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
ENGLAND IN THE SUNSHINE 
TEMPERATURES UP TO SEVENTEEN CELSIUS OR EIGHTEEN 
CELSIUS CELSIUS SIXTEEN CELSIUS IN MANCHESTER FOR 
INSTANCE LOTS OF SUNSHINE THIS 
AFTERNOON AFTER A WET START IN 
NORTH WEST ENGLAND 
BUT THERE WILL BE RAIN ACROSS 
EASTERN PARTS OF SCOTLAND CLOUDY 
HERE DURING THE AFTERNOON WHILE THE 
WEST COAST BRIGHTENS UP AND LIFTS 
THE TEMPERATURES TO THIRTEEN CELSIUS M. IT 
GLAS GO SIXTEEN CELSIUS IN BELFAST IT 
WILL BE A DRY AND SUNNY ONE IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND JUST THE RISK OF 
ONE OR TWO SHOWERS THIS AFTERNOON 
BUT MOST PLACES WILL AVOID THEM AND 
IT SHOULD STAY DRY ACROSS WALES AND 
THE SOUTH WEST WITH DESCENT SPELLS 
OF SUNSHINE HERE AND TEMPERATURES 
INTO THE MID TEENS 
THROUGH THIS EVENING THE RAIN 
CLEARING CLEARS THE EAST COAST 
TURNING MISTY AND MURKY IN ONE OR 
TWO SPOTS WE WILL SEE RAIN PUSH IN 
ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND WALES AND

TEMPERATURES TONIGHT NO LOWER THAN 
FIVE TO EIGHT CELSIUS

RAIN WILL BE HEAVIER AND THERE 
COULD BE THE ODD CLAP OF THUNDER 
WHILST SKIES WILL BRIGHTEN TOWARDS 
THE WEST THERE WILL BE ONE OR TWO 
SHOWERS AND TEMPERATURES PERHAPS 
NOT AS HIGH 
HE DID TELL US WHAT THE WEATHER WAS 
LIKE IN THE NORTH EAST 
YES YES PARTICULARLY ON SAINT GEORGE'S DAY 
WE'RE GOING THERE NOW WHEN YOU 
THINK ABOUT THE OR ORIGINS OF JAZZ 
MUSIC NORTHUMBERLAND DOESN'T 
SPRING TO ME BUT COURTNEY PINE 
TRAVELLED TO THE HOLY ISLAND OF 
LINDISFARNE TO FIND INSPIRATION 
IT IS PART OF A SPECIAL SERIES OF 
FILMS TO BE SHOWN ON B. B. C. ONE TO 
CELEBRATE SAINT GEORGE'S DAY 
NICE TO SEE YOU 
NICE TO SEE YOU TOO 
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENED 
THE FIRST THING I NOTICED AFTER I 
TOOK OFF MY CITY EARS WAS THE 
SOUNDS OF THE BIRDS 
YOU COULD ACTUALLY HEAR THEM 
SINGING 
YOU COULD ACTUALLY HEAR THEM SINGING 
WE SET UP AND I WAS PLAYING ALONG 
WITH THE BIRDS AND WE WERE IN 
CONVERSATION FOR A MINUTE 
THAT'S LOVELY BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL A BIT OF SAX IN THE MORNING 
LOVELY LOVELY THAT WAS INNER CITY BOY GOES TO 
SOMEWHERE LIKE THE HOLY ISLAND OFF 
THE COAST OF NORTHUMBERLAND AND YOU 
FOUND A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT THAT 
INSPIRED YOU 
I NEVER HEARD OF HOLY 
ISLAND AND DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HOLY 
ISLAND 
NO UNTIL I HEARD ABOUT THE ISLAND PROGRAMME 
IT IS SO REMOTE AND FAR PROGRAMME AWAY AND WHEN I GOT TO THE ISLAND 
THERE WAS THE SOUND OF NATURE THE 
SOUND OF THE BIRDS THE SOUND OF 
THE ENVIRONMENT IT IS A PLACE 
WHERE THE VIKINGS LANDED FIRST 
PEOPLE DID PILGRIMAGES TO HOLY 
ISLAND YOU CAN'T AT CERTAIN TIMES 
OF THE DAY GET OFF OR ON THE ISLAND 
SO IT IS REMOTE IT IS A NICE PLACE 
TO GO TO L. DON'T WANT TO SPOIL IT 
BY TELLING LOTS OF PEOPLE THAT THEY 
SHOULD VISIT IT SOON BUT IT IS A 
PLACE THAT EVERYBODY IN BRITAIN AND 
EVERYBODY WHO IS A PART OF THE U. K. 
SHOULD SEE AT SOMETIME 
YOUR TASK WAS TO COMPOSE PIECE 
OF MUSIC FOR SAINT GEORGE'S DAY BASED 
ON HOW YOU FELT ABOUT BEING THERE 
YES THIS IS A PART OF SEVERAL 
PROGRAMMES ABOUT GREAT BRITAIN 
VARIOUS VARIOUS ARTISTS ARE ASKED 
TO GO TO VARIOUS LOCATIONS OUT OF 
THE NORM AND CREATE A PIECE 
SCULPTURE SOME MUSIC SOUNDS 
WHATEVER ABOUT THAT ENVIRONMENT L. 
THINK IT IS A FASCINATING PROGRAMME 
WHERE YOU CAN TAKE SOMEBODY FROM 
YOU KNOW AS FAR AS INNER CITY 
LONDON LIKE MYSELF TO GO OUT THERE 
AND CREATE MUSIC ABOUT THE 
ENVIRONMENT L. SPOKE TO SOME OF THE 
PEOPLE THERE SOME FASCINATING FOLK 
INCLUDING LOCAL MUSICIANS ONE OR 
TWO AND WE WILL SEE HOW YOU GOT ON 
WITH THEM NOW 
O. K. 
HAVING MET CATHERINE I JUST LOVE 
THE SOUND L. JUST THOUGHT ALL 
THAT THAT DEDICATION TO A HARD 
INSTRUMENT TO PLAY IT IS VERY 
INSPIRING TO ME SOMEBODY LIKE THAT 
I'M USING SOME OF THE ORNAMENTS 
THE WAY SHE TRILLED ON HER 
INSTRUMENT ON THE PIPES IN THE 
SAXOPHONE SAXOPHONE USUALLY I TRY TO HEAR TUNES OR 
MELODIES OR THE WAY PEOPLE SPEAK 
AND TRY AND MIMIC IT IN MY MUSIC 
FOR ME IT WAS A MATTER OF MIXING 
THE SCALES THE RHYTHM THE WHO ARE 
MONTHIES TO THE HARMONIES TO 
THE STORIES I HEARD ABOUT THE PLACE 
YOU SPOKE SPOKE HOW THE MUSICIANS 
INSPIRED YOU BECAUSE YOU MET 
KATHERYNE TICKELL WHO PLAYS THE 
PIPES 
IT IS AKIN TO THE BAG PIPES PIPES BUT A SHARPER AND BRIGHTER SOUND 
AND KATHERYNE TICKELL CAME OVER AND 
SPOKE TO US AND PLAYED AND 
EXPLAINED SOME OF THE SOUNDS AND 
HOW EVERY ENVIRONMENT HAS A KIND OF 
A FOLK FEEL IT DOESN'T MATTER 
WHERE YOU'RE FORM SOUTH NORTH 
SOUTH EAST BRISTOL THERE IS AN 
ANTHEM FOR THOSE AREAS AND THEY 
HAVE THEIR SOUND AND I WAS 
FORTUNATE TO HEAR SOME OF IT AND 
INCORPORATE IT INTO THE COMPOSITION 
YOU GOT TO INCORPORATE THE ELEMENTS 
BECAUSE IT CAN BE BLEAK THERE YOU YOU SAID SAX ON THE BEACH I WAS BEING 
BLOWN AWAY BY THE BREEZE IT IS 
INCREDIBLE YOU STAND THERE AND SEE 
THE SAND STORMS THE WEATHER IS 
EXTREME EXTREME YOU SAID SAX THAT'S NOT YOUR 
REGULAR SAXOPHONE 
THIS IS THE SUE 
THE SUE PRAN OWE SAXOPHONE 
WHAT WAS LOVELY ABOUT THE PROGRAMME 
THE POINT WAS TO HIGHLIGHT SAINT 
GEORGE'S DAY AND IN I THINK GLAND 
THERE ARE DIFFERENT SOUNDS WHEN 
YOU WENT TO HOLY ISLAND IT WAS A 
DIFFERENT SOUND TO YOUR AREA IN 
INNER LONDON AND YOU HEARD NATURE 
ALMOST FOR THE FIRST TIME BIRDS 
SINGING SINGING YOU DON'T HEAR IT IN THE INNER CITY 
YOU LIVE IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT AND 
YOU GET USED TO POLICE SIRENS OR 
HELICOPTERS AND YOU GET USE TODAY 
YOUR LOCAL SOUNDS WHEN YOU MOVE TO 
ANOTHER AREA YOU HEAR OTHER SOUNDS 
AND YOU ABSORB AND LISTEN TO THE 
SOUNDS AND INCORPORATE THAT INTO A 
COMPOSITION IT IS SOMETHING THAT 
MUSICIANS DO 
A MORE INTERNATIONAL FLAVOUR TO 
YOUR NEW ALBUM OUT NEXT WEEK WHICH 
IS NOT ENGLISH AS SUCH AS ALL 
I CALL IT BRITISH AND I WOULD LIKE 
TO GIVE YOU ONE 
LOVELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
IT IS STILL WRAPPED 
THAT MEANS 
IF YOU SAY IT SIX TIMES 
IT BECOMES A REAL WORD 
AFROPEANS AFROPEANS AFROPEANS 
I HEARD ABOUT IT ON THE INTERNET 
AND IT SUMS UP WHO WE ARE OF 
AFRICAN DESCENT BUT WHO EXIST IN 
EUROPE AND THIS IS KIND OF SOME OF 
US WHO CREATE THIS ALBUM WHICH WAS 
RECORDED LIVE LAST OCTOBER TO KIND 
OF COMMEMORATE THE BY CENTENARY OF 
THE SAVE ACT BY THE BRITISH HOUSES 
OF PARLIAMENT 
DO YOU FEEL BRITISH DO YOU FEEL 
AFRICAN 
BRITISH BY NOW IT IS OVER AFRICAN YOU COULD TALK TALK TO SO MANY 
MUSICIAN ARTISTS POLITICIANS 
GUYS LIKE ME WHO HAVE COME FROM 
WHOSE PARENTS WHOSE CULTURE COMES 
FROM ANOTHER PLACE BUT FEEL THAT WE 
ARE A PART OF THIS CULTURE AND WE 
CONTRIBUTE YOU CAN GO ACROSS AMIR 
KHAN O. K. YOU DO HAVE PEOPLE WHO SAY 
THEY ARE WELSH OR IRISH OR SCOTTISH 
OR YOU KNOW BUT FOR THE MOST PART 
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE UNITED 
KINGDOM I FEEL THAT MY FATHER WAS 
A CARPENTER WHO BUILT A LOT OF THE 
BUILDINGS IN PADDINGTON 
CONTRIBUTED TO WHAT WE HAVE AS A 
UNITED KINGDOM SO I DO FEEL 
BRITISH BRITISH LOVELY TO SEE YOU 
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL PROGRAMME 
A H. THANK YOU 
THANKS FOR COMING IN 
JAZZ IN THE 
MORNING JAZZ IN THE MORNING WE LOVE IT 
YOU CAN SEE COURTNEY PINE'S FILM 
TONIGHT 
YOU CAN SEE COURTNEY PINE'S FILM TONIGHT TONIGHT THERE ARE OTHER PROGRAMMES GOING ON 
IN OTHER AREAS 
GONE WITH THE WIND HAS BEEN A HUGE 
SUCCESS AS A BOOK AND A FILM AND 
NOW THE STAGE PRODUCTION OPENED 
LAST NIGHT IT STARS DARIUS DANESH 
FROM POP IDOL AND HE GOT A 
STANDING OVATION FOR HIS 
PERFORMANCE LAST NIGHT BUT NOT ALL 
THE CRITICS AGREED BUT AS DAVID 
SILLITO REPORTS TOMORROW IS 
ANOTHER DAY 
I CAN DO JUST AS I 
PLEASE 
DARIUS AS REHETT BULLETLER AND THE 
MAN WHO CAST HIM HAD NEVER WATCHED 
POP IDOL 
TO GET THE ROLE WAS A 
DEEM AND MORE SO BECAUSE AFTER I 
GOT THE ROLE HE SAID THE FIRST TIME 
DARIUS WALKED IN I HAD NO IDEA WHO 
HE WAS 
BUT THE STORY OF TURNING THIS PIECE 
OF LITERATURE INTO STAGE 
BLOCKBUSTER IS A DIFFICULT ATTEMPT 
IT IS THE WRITER'S FIRST TIME WITH 
A SHOW AND SHE WANTS TO SEE A LESS 
SCHEMING SCARLETT O'HARA AND MORE 
OF A PUT UPON MUM 
SHE HAS TO 
FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROVIDE FOR 
HERSELF AND HER LARGE EXTENDED 
FAMILY AT A VERY YOUNG AGE WHEN 
SHE IS A TEENAGER UNDER THE MOST 
HORRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES AND HER 
JOURNEY IS HEROIC SHE IS NOT 
PERFECT SHE IS FLAWED BUT SHE 
DOES WHAT WOMEN DO IN COMMUNITIES 
ALL OVER THE U. K. THE U. S. AND ALL 
OVER THE WORLD 
OF COURSE THE SHOW 
HAS BEEN DOGGED BY SAFETY PROBLEMS 
AND AT ONE POINT IT WAS FOUR AND A 
QUARTER HOURS LONG BUT IT MADE IT 
TO OPENING NIGHT AND A VERY 
APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE 
I CAME TO 
THE PREVIEWS AND I PREFER THE 
LONGER VERSE 
YOU LIKE THE FOUR 
AND A HALF HOUR VERSION HONESTLY HONESTLY I COULD KEEP SITTING THERE AND 
WATCHING IT 
IT WAS NICE TO HEAR 
THE LINES AGAIN YOU WANT TO EAT 
THEM UP THEY'RE GORGEOUS I HAVE 
TO BEG AND STEAL I'LL NEVER GO 
HUNGRY AGAIN IT IS GETTING DOWN TO 
THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL OF 
SURVIVAL TACTICS AND COMING BACK UP 
AGAIN IT IS A GREAT SURVIVAL STORY 
AND IT'S GREAT FOR THE UNITED 
STATES TO HAVE A SURVIVAL STORY 
LIKE LES MIS 
TO SEE IT ACTED IS AMAZING TOO TOO LONG 
NO NOT AT ALL WORTH EVERY LONG MINUTE 
BUT THE CRITICS WERE NOT SO MINUTE IMPRESSED MANY HAVE BEEN SCATHING 
SEVERAL FELT IT WAS FAR TOO LONG 
INDEED SOME CRITICS HAVE BEEN 
SHARPENING THEIR PENCILS BEFORE 
TONIGHT'S PERFORMANCE BUT REMEMBER 
ANOTHER EPIC BY TREVOR NUNN WAS 
PANNED ON OPENING NIGHT LES 
MISERABLES ONLY TO BECOME ONE OF 
LONDON'S LONGEST RUNNING SHOWS 
IT IS WHAT THE AWED YENSS THINK 
IT IS WHAT THE AUDIENCES THINK THAT 
COUNTS 
AND IT'S DOWN TO DARIUS COUNTS AND HE DOES SEEM TO LIKE HIS WORK 
COMING NEXT IS 
MISSING LIVE ON ON MISSING LIVE TODAY TWO MATES ARE 
AT THE BAR TOGETHER AND ONE SPEARS 
WHERE DID HE GO 
AND THE SEVENTY SIX YEAR 
OLD MAN WHO HAS JUST FOUND OUT HE
