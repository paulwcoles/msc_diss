DECENT WICKET HERE YOU HAVE SOME 
SYMPATHY OUT THERE LET'S LOCK AT 
THE TASK YOU SAID YOU HAD A GOOD 
SYSTEM IN PLACE DO YOU STACHED BY 
THAT 
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WAS THAT WRITTEN DOWN TO THE T. IT WAS 
SIMPLE TO FOLLOW EACH LIST TO FIND 
OUT WHICH CLOTHING BELONGED TO 
WHICH CUSTOMER L. MEAN ANYBODY 
ANYBODY WHO HADN'T EVEN WORKED IN A 
LAUNDRY I NEVER HAD COULD HAVE 
FOLLOWED THESE SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS 
IF YOU HAD BEEN THERE AND YOU 
HAVEN'T BEGUN HOME IS THE POINT 
IT WOULDN'T HAVE GONE WRONG WE WE STILL WOULD HAVE LOST WE STILL

LET'S SEE HOW IT WENT HORRIBLY 
WRONG NFRPBLGTS THIS TASK I DON'T

GO BACK AND SECURE THE IRON 
O. K. YOU

FIRST CAR CONTROL OF WHAT WAS GOING ON WE'RE WE'RE MISSING A MEN'S SHIRT I'M NOT 
GOING TO TIP YOU I'M AFRAID 
ONE OF 
YOUR CLIENTS IS STILL LOOKING FOR 
SOME OF HIS CLOTHING I THINK TWO TWO OTHER PEOPLES' SHIRTS 
CLAIRE WHAT 
ARE YOUR THOUGHTS LOOKING AT THIS 
HAVING BEEN ON A WINNING TEAM 
LOOKING AT WHAT A LOSING TEAM DID 
I THINK YOU WERE SHAFTED L. THINK 
EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS THAT 
I FEEL FOR YOU THE DISAPPOINTING 
THING FOR ME WATCHING THE GIRLS 
TEAM IS THEY FAILED ON SO MANY 
LEVELS OF COMMUNICATION WITH EACH 
OTHER STRATEGY APPLICATION AS 
WELL IT WAS SASTER PURE PURE MANAGEMENT ISSUE 
WELL YES 
DON'T THINK THE TEAM MEMBERS HELPED 
I THINK YOU WERE ONE OF THE FEW WHO 
ACTUALLY BROUGHT SOME ORGANISATION 
TO THAT TEAM MEAN THE 
FUNDAMENTAL PART OF IT WAS NOT TO 
LOSE PEOPLE'S CLOTHES WHAT DID 
THEY DO MIXED UP EVERYONE'S 
CLOTHES THINK YOU WERE THE ONE 
TO COME UP WITH THE SUGGESTIONS 
RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING YOUR TEAM 
LEADER ONLY WANTED TO TRAIN YOU ALL 
ON SALES TRAINING WHEN MOST OF YOU 
HAVE IT SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
TRYING TO COME UP WITH THE 
ORGANISATION OF THE WHOLE TASK I I THINK THERE'S NO DOUBT THIS WAS A 
DIFFICULT TASK BUT I HAVE TO SAY 
THE GIRLS TEAM MADE IT LOOK 
IMPOSSIBLE IF I'M HONEST I DO 
BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE THE ONE 
PERSON WHO ACTUALLY LOOKED LIKE YOU 
MIGHT JUST BRING A BIT OF ORDER 
INTO THE CHAOS 
LAST WEEK THE GIRLS TRIUMPHED THIS 
WEEK THEY SEEMED TO LEAVE THEIR 
BRAINS IN THE DRIER IT DIDN'T BODE 
WELL I'VE GOT TO SAY WHEN A 
COUPLE OF THEM COULDN'T EVEN AGREE 
TO THE TIME OF DAY LISTEN 
CAREFULLY HERE 
GOOD MORNING HELLO HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON 
IS IT MORNING OR AFTERNOON IF YOU 
CAN'T AGREE ON THAT 
IT WAS 
AFTERNOON WE DIDN'T GET OURSELVES 
ORGANISE UNTIL ONE P. M. IT WAS 
DEFINITELY THE AFTERNOON 
THEN WE 
HAD THIS AMAZING SITUATION THE 
PRICING DEBACLE YOU DIDN'T SEEM TO 
BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED FEATURING THE 
WOMAN INCIDENTALLY WHO DESCRIBED 
HERSELF AS THE BEST SALESPERSON IN 
EUROPE LET'S NOT FORGET 
WHY DON'T 
WE SAY EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE 
WITH US IS FOUR POINT NINE NINE 
YEAH DEFINITELY 
WE'RE GOING TO DO STANDARD PRICE 
FOR EVERYTHING FOUR POINT NINE NINE 
IS THAT YOUR 
BEST PRICE 
BECAUSE THAT WOULD COME 
TO FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
EVEN THE BEST 
SALESPERSON IN EUROPE COULDN'T GET 
FOUR POINT NINE NINE TO WASH A PILLOW CASE YOU'VE 
BEEN IN THE HOTEL BUSINESS WHAT 
DUE MAKE OF THAT 
IT WAS AMAZING 
THAT YOU COULD BELIEVE YOU COULD 
GET ANYTHING LIKE THAT PRICE THE 
LOOK ON THE CUSTOMER'S FACE SHOULD 
HAVE SENT A WARNING ASTONISHING 
THEY WERE IN THE WRONG BALLPARK BY 
A LONG WAY THEY JUST HADN'T 
THOUGHT ABOUT IT IN AN INTELLIGENT 
WAY 
WE DIDN'T EVEN DO BRAIN WAY STORMING 
YOU DID PLENTY OF BRAIN STORMING STORMING BUT ABOUT THE WRONG THING 
BY WAY OF ARGUING BUT WE DIDN'T DO 
ANYTHING CONSTRUCTIVE IN TERMS OF 
PRICING WHO IS THE TARGET MARKET 
WHAT AREA OF LONDON ARE WE DOING 
COMMERCIAL RESIDENTIAL THERE WAS 
NO PLANNING 
THERE'S A LOGIC TO 
FLAT PRICING YOU THINK IT'S SIMPLE 
ANY WAY AND PERHAPS THEY'LL BUY 
THAT MAYBE 
NO NOT REALLY YOU'VE 
GOT TO DO YOUR HOME WORK L. ALWAYS 
SAY TO MY TEAM FAIL TO PLAN PLAN 
TO FAIL THAT'S WHAT YOU DID YOU 
DIDN'T DO ANY RESEARCH OR YOUR HOME 
WORK 
THE HORRIFIED LOOKING MAN WHO WORK FIELDED THAT ASTONISHING PRICE IS 
IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT SCOT ARE 
YOU OVER IT YET 
NO L. STILL CAN'T 
BELIEVE IT HAPPENED IT WAS JUST 
YOU KNOW TWICE AS MUCH AS I SELL 
MY ROOMS FOR 
HOW DID YOU AVOID 
YOUR FOREHEAD NOT HITTING THE DESK 
IN FRONT OF YOU YOU KEPT QUITE A 
STRAIGHT FACE 
I WAS CLOSE TO 
WALKING OUT AND SAYING AWAY YOU GO 
IT'S JUST RIDICULOUS THEY DIDN'T 
EVEN WANT TO NEGOTIATE 
THANKS FOR 
COMING TONIGHT HAVING GOT ONE LOT 
OF PRICES FAR TOO HIGH THEY THEN 
WENT AND PITCHED MILES TOO LOW FOR FOR THAT LOT THERE WE CAN PROBABLY DO 
IT ALL FOR TEN 
EVERYTHING FOR TEN 
THAT'S A GOOD PRICE WHAT DO YOU 
THINK WAS IT TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW 
TOO HIGH L. L. DON'T THINK IT WAS TOO HIGH 
THERE WERE CLUES IN HIS TONE HIGH OF VOICE COULD YOU NOT PICK UP THE 
INCE DUALITY WE HEARD IT FROM SCOT 
HADN'T WE 
LAST WEEK THE GIRLS TEAM 
ABOUT THEIR HOME WORK ON THE PRICE 
OF FISH THIS WEEK NONE OF YOU RANG 
A LAUNDRY SERVICE THEY SEEM TO 
HAVE TRANSFORMED THEMSELVES ONE WAY 
AND YOU'VE GONE THE OTHER WAY EVEN EVEN COMMON SENSE DIDN'T PREVAIL 
NEGOTIATE GAITING IN NEGOTIATE 
ANYTHING PRICE YOU WENT FROM ONE 
EXTREME TO THE OTHER THE GUY WAS 
STUNNED HE WAS JUST LIKE W. H. A. HE 
WAS TRYING TO SAY ARE YOU SURE 
THAT'S THE MESSAGE HE WAS GIVING 
AND YOU GUYS WERE GOING YES ISN'T 
THAT GREAT WE'LL BE IRONING ALL 
NIGHT FOR A TENNER 
YOU HADN'T GOT 
YOUR PRICING RIGHT BUT THE 
IMPORTANT THING WAS YOU HAD A TWENTY FOUR 
HOUR HELP LINE WHICH WE ALL AGREE 
IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR ANY 
LAUNDRY OPERATION L. DON'T THINK 
IT'S CLEAR ON THERE WHOSE DAFT 
IDEA WAS THAT 
CERTAINLY NOT MINE 
WE ONLY HAVE YOUR WORD ON THAT CAN 
YOU REMEMBER WHOSE IT WAS 
I THINK 
IT WAS LUCINDA NO LINDI AND JENNY 
I WILL GET TO MEET THEM ONE DAY AND 
I'LL PUT THAT TO THEM THE IDEA 
DIDN'T FLOAT SIR ALAN'S BOAT LIKE LIKE SOMEONE WOULD PHONE UP AND SAY 
HELLO GIRLS HOW'S MY PANTS 
DOING GOING TO PHONE THE TWENTY FOUR H. O. U. R. 
HOT LINE TO SEE THE PROGRESS ON MY 
CALVIN KLEINS 
IF THEY JUST GOT ON 
WITH DOING LAUNDRY THEY WOULDN'T 
HAVE HAD TIME FOR DAFT IDEAS THAT THAT IS HALF THE PROBLEM PEOPLE THINK 
THESE THINGS ARE MISTICAL AND 
MAGICAL NINETY NINE TIMES OUT OF ONE HUNDRED 
GETTING ON WITH IT IS THE ANSWER 
WHEN YOU SEE IT HAPPENING IT SEEMS 
SO OBVIOUS BUT I LOVED THE HELP 
LINE L. THOUGHT IT WAS BRILLIANT 
IT'S A GIFT 
I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT 
TO SAY ABOUT JENNY BUT WHY DIDN'T 
YOU SAY IT AT THE MOMENT THE KEY 
QUESTION WAS ASKED WHEN YOU FIRST 
GOT INTO THE BOARDROOM 
HOW WAS THE 
TEAM LEADER GOOD 
EVERYBODY HAPPY GOOD UPS AND DOWNS BUT OVERALL IT WAS 
GOOD 
IF YOU HAD PROBLEMS WHY GOOD DIDN'T YOU SPEAK UP 
IT WAS SHOCK 
HORROR L. COULDN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE 
WERE SAYING IT WAS FINE 
WHY NOT 
SPEAK UP THEN 
IT WAS THE CASE THAT 
I WAS SAFE AND I WOULDN'T BE CALLED 
TO THE BOARDROOM BY SAYING 
SOMETHING I WOULD SAY SMEEZ AGAINST 
ME SHE WOULD BRING ME INTO THE 
BOARDROOM 
YOU WERE GOING WITH THE BOARDROOM FLOW L. MEAN WHY SHOULD YOU SAY 
ANYTHING IF YOU KNOW YOU DON'T NEED 
TO YEAH 
IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT TO YEAH UPSETTING JENNY WELL LOOK WHAT 
SHE DID TO YOU ANY WAY YOU MIGHT 
AS WELL CLAIRE YOU'VE BEEN IN A 
SIMILAR SITUATION 
THE ONE THING I 
WILL SAY IN YOUR DEFENCE I'VE BEEN 
THERE YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER 
YOU'VE WON AT THAT STAGE HE SAYS 
TO YOU DID YOU HAVE A GOOD LEADER 
AND YOU'RE THINKING WELL WE DON'T 
KNOW YET SO WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER 
WE'VE WON SO YOU GO YEAH 
OR THE 
FEW WHO KEPT QUIET AND DON'T WANT 
TO COMMENT AT ALL 
THERE WAS A 
MOMENT IT BECAME CLEAR ON JENNY'S 
FACE HOW TO SAVE HERSELF HOW SHE 
COULD IN CLAIRE'S WORDS SHAFT 
SOMEBODY ELSE IT DAWNED ON HER AND 
IT'S A FRIGHTENING MOMENT WHEN YOU 
SEE THE LOOK THAT PASSES ACROSS HER 
FACE 
WE HAD WASHING THAT YOU KNEW FACE WHAT IT WAS AND WHERE IT WENT AND 
YOU LEFT AND NOBODY ELSE KNEW YOU YOU CAN SEE THAT THOUGHT BUBBLE THERE 
CAN'T YOU L. KNEW THAT SPELLED 
TROUBLE FOR YOU SHE WAS THE ONE 
THAT GOT AWAY THIS WEEK HOW DID 
SHE MAKE HER ESCAPE 
JENNY IT'S 
REGRETFUL THAT YOU'RE UNABLE TO 
CONTROL THESE TWO PEOPLE HERE L. 
HAVE TO HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE I 
HAVE TO HOLD YOU FULLY RESPONSIBLE 
FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO KEEP A TEAM 
IN PLACE WHY SHOULD PBLT I FIRE 
YOU 
THESE TWO PEOPLE HAVE NOT YOU SUPPORTED ME ONE AYE OATA ALSO 
THEY DO NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO 
DELIVER TO THE TEAM EITHER NOT 
ONLY IS IT THEIR ATTITUDE THAT IS 
OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME BUT THEIR 
LACK OF ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE 
ANYTHING OF ANY VALUE 
WELL LOOK 
SHE FOUGHT HER CORNER YOU'VE GOT 
TO GIVE HER THAT WHICH IS WHAT THE 
APPRENTICE IS ALL ABOUT SHE SHE CERTAINLY DID WHAT SHE DID IN PROT 
SES IS SHE DIDN'T TAKE THE FACT 
THAT LUCINDA AND I WERE PROBABLY 
THE TWO INSTRUMENTAL PEOPLE IN THAT 
TEAM 
FAIR ENOUGH L. WOULD AGREE TEAM YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP FOR YOURSELF 
YOU HAVE TO DEFEND YOURSELF THAT'S 
PART OF BUSINESS BLAMING EVERYBODY 
ELSE WE SEE IT EVERY DAY YEAH YEAH THERE'S NO ARGUMENT ABOUT THAT L. 
HONESTLY THOUGHT AT THAT MOMENT 
WHERE JENNY COTTONED ON IF SHE 
SWITCHED THE ATTACK IT WAS LIKE A 
CROSS BETWEEN LADY MACBETH AND THE 
SNAKE SCENE FROM JUNGLE BOOK IT 
WAS AN ASTONISHING MOMENT GIVE HER 
HER DUE SHE SAW IT AND SHE PLAY 
TODAY BRILLIANTLY L. DON'T THINK 
THAT MAKES HER A GOOD LEADER IN 
FACT MAYBE THE OPPOSITE BUT MY GOD 
HER INSTINCT WAS BANG ON 
DID YOU 
ADMIRE HER AT THAT STAGE HER 
POLITICAL SKILLS IF YOU CAN CALL 
THEM THAT 
I THINK THAT SHE HAD A 
STRATEGY IN THAT MEETING AND SHE 
WAS QUICK TO PICK UP ON IT L. THINK 
DO I THINK SHE'S A NICE PERSON I 
THINK ALL THAT'S MISSING FROM THE 
SHOW FROM JENNY IS A CREAM SUIT AND 
A POSHER ACCENT AND WE HAVE A KATIE 
THE SECOND 
HOWEVER TO GIVE JENNY HER DUE 
THERE'S DIFFERENCE KATIE DID A 
LOT OF HER STUFF BEHIND CLOSED 
DOORS JENNY IS OUT IN FRONT OF YOU 
THERE'S NOTHING SHE SAID BEHIND 
LUCINDA'S BACK 
IN SOME WAYS EVEN 
WORSE WHEN SHE TOOK THE KNIFE OUT 
IN THE BOARDROOM WHEN SHE ACCUSED 
YOU OF LYING THAT'S WHEN YOUR FACE 
CHANGED MICHELLE AND I HAD A BET 
ON IT WHEN WE WERE WATCHING I 
SAID JENNY WOULD GET FIRED AND WE WE HAD A FIVER ON IT 
NONE OF US 
THOUGHT YOU WOULD GET IT WE DIDN'T 
SHE IS SCARY WE PUT THIS V. T. 
TOGETHER MAYBE YOU CAN SHOW YOUR 
CHILDREN IF YOU WANT TO TAPE THIS 
AT HOME 
WE'VE GOT TWO MINTOITS GET THE 
BLOODY NAP KINS TO THE VAN AND 
YOU'RE TAKING ONE OUT AND FOLDING 
IT UP ON THE SIDE 
I'VE BEEN 
IGNORED THROUGH THE MAJORITY OF THE 
MORNING 
WHAT I WOULD EXPECT FROM MORNING MY TEAM IS NOT TO ACT LIKE SPOILED 
SILLY LITTLE GIRL WHO'S THROWING 
HER DUMMY OUT OF THE PRAM BECAUSE 
I JUST GET IT AND SHOVE IT DOWN HER 
THROAT THROAT WHEN I HAVE TEAM MEMBERS DOING SUCH 
LUDICROUS STUPID THINGS IT MEANS 
I'M HAVING TO CONCENTRATE AND 
DIRECT AND DISPROPORTIONAL AMOUNT 
OF MY TIME ON MANAGING YOU CAN YOU 
BE QUIET PLEASE CAN YOU BE QUIET 
I HAVEN'T FINISHED I'M THE 
PRODGEOCT MANAGER AND I HAVEN'T 
FINISHED L. HAVE NOT FINISHED YOU 
CAN FEED BACK TO ME IN A MINUTE 
WHEN I AM FINISHED YOU CAN FEED 
BACK TO ME WHEN I'M FINISHED O. K. 
IT HAS FELT LIKE I'VE HAD TO 
BREAST FEED YOU 
IT'S LIKE A FUNGUS THAT STARTS 
EATING AWAY AT THE POSITIVITY OF 
THE TEAM 
YOU'RE POISON RUNNING THROUGH MY 
VAINS 
I'M JUST WONDERING HOW THIRSTY I'D 
HAVE TO BE BEFORE I WENT FOR A 
BREAST FEED FROM JENNY 
IS THERE ANYBODY WHO BEHAVES LIKE 
THAT IN YOUR ORGANISATION 
ABSOLUTELY NOT 
ARE YOU SURE 
HONESTLY PEOPLE COME INTO THE 
BOARDROOM AND EVERYONE'S GOT FIRE 
IN THEIR BELLY THAT'S GOOD THEY'RE 
ENTHUSIASTIC WE MIGHT HAVE WEE 
ARGUMENT HERE OR THERE BUT THAT 
WAS A MESS A GOOD LEADER GETS 
PEOPLE ON THEIR SIDE THEY WORK AS 
A TEAM AND THEY'LL FIND THEIR TEAM 
WILL WANT TO DO MORE FOR THEM THE 
WAY SHE SPEAKS TO PEOPLE IS 
OUTRAGEOUS YOU DON'T SPEAK TO YOUR 
TEAM LIKE THAT 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
THIS IS THE PAINFUL BIT EVERYONE 
LOVES NEW HERE DON'T BE OFFENDED 
WHAT YOU HEAR NEXT THIS IS WHAT 
SIR ALAN HAD TO SAY ABOUT YOU 
SHAZIA REALLY HAD ONE ROLE TO DO 
SHE HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 
LAUNDRY WAS IDENTIFIED SHE MESSED 
THAT UP 
SHE'S A PAIN IN THE 
BACKSIDE NOT A TEAM PLAYER SHE'S 
IN IT FOR HERSELF L. FIND HER A 
WASTE OF TIME 
EVERYTHING WAS IN 
ORDER 
IT WAS YOU WERE DOG A 
GREAT JOB SO WHY LEAVE IT AT THE 
CRITICAL POINT 
SHE'S VERY NEGATIVE 
SO THE MINUTE SOMETHING GOES WRONG 
SHE'S COMPLAINING SHE'S PUTTING 
THAT PERSON DOWN SHE'S OH THE END 
IS NIGH IT HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT 
ON EVERYBODY ELSE 
SHE LEFT HER 
PEOPLE IN THE LURCH SHE WENT HOME 
THAT'S NOT THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT 
WOULD EVER WORK IN ONE OF MY 
ORGANISATIONS THAT'S WHY I FIRED 
SHAZIA SHAZIA THERE'S MUCH SHAKING OF HEADS HERE 
ON OUR PANEL HOW WOULD YOU REACT 
TO THAT STUNNED INTO SILENCE 
STUNNED AT THE END OF THE DAY I 
WAS TOLD BY THE PROJECT MANAGER TO 
LEAVE BECAUSE IT WAS MY IDEA TO GO 
AND GET THE IRONS BECAUSE WE NEEDED 
TO WORK ALL NIGHT BECAUSE WE RAN 
OUT OF TIME 
IT MUST BE PAINFUL TO 
WATCH 
TO USE A FOOTBALL ANALOGY WATCH IN A GAME OF TWO HALVES YOU SCORED 
WELL IN THE FIRST HALF BUT THE 
PRESENTATION IN THE BOARDROOM IN 
THE SECOND HALF IT WAS AWFUL 
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE IT SHOULDN'T BE 
ABOUT THAT BUT IT IS PART OF THE 
GAME 
WHAT ABOUT THE BOYS THEY DID GAME RATHER WELL DIDN'T THEY AND THE 
MALE BONDING CAME TO THE FORE MY 
WORD THEY LOVED EACH OTHER 
YOU WITH THE SAD EYES 
DON'T BE DISCOURAGED 
IT'S HARD TO TAKE COURAGE 
IN WORLD FULL OF PEOPLE YOU 
CAN LOSE SIGHT OF IT 
BUT I SEE YOUR TRUE COLOURS 
SHINING THROUGH 
THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU 
SO DON'T BE AFRAID 
TO LET IT SHOW 
YOUR TRUE COLOURS TRUE COLOURS 
TRUE COLOURS ARE SHINING THROUGH 
I SEE YOUR TRUE COLOURS AND 
THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU 
SO DON'T BE AFRAID TO LET THEM 
SHOW SHOW YOUR TRUE COLOURS TRUE COLOURS 
ARE BEAUTIFUL LIKE RAINBOW I'VE GOT TO SAY BY THE END OF THE 
TASK IF YOU LOOK AT IT THE HOMO 
EROTIC STUFF WAS GETTING QUITE 
SERIOUS HERE IN A SCENE BARELY 
SUITABLE FOR TERRESTRIAL TELEVISION 
WE EVEN SEE THEM MOUNTING EACH 
OTHER LOOK I'M BROAD MINDED BUT 
THAT'S DISGUSTING 
YOU PRESENT 
MATCH OF THE DAY TWO THEY DO THAT 
AFTER EVERY GOAL IT WAS SIMON'S 
VERSION OF A PETER CROUCH DANCE 
FOOTBALLERS MIGHT DO THAT AFTER 
GOAL BUT THEY NEVER DANCE LIKE 
THIS AFTER SCORING WHAT DUE MAKE 
OF THE BOYS THEN 
I THOUGHT THE 
BOYS WERE ABSOLUTELY SHIT HOT TO BE 
HONEST L. REALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE 
JUST FULL OF ENERGY FIRE 
ORGANISATION I THINK THE GUY WHO 
BROUGHT THE WHOLE TASK TOGETHER WAS 
SIMON HE IS CRACKING BUT HE WAS 
JUST GET THE JOB DONE GET THE 
SLEEVES ROLLED UP L. WILL BE 
INTERESTED TO SEE HIM GO ON IN THE 
NEXT COUPLE OF SHOWS BUT IF I WAS 
EVER GOING TO BRING OUT ULT MOW 
MEN'S PANTS I WOULD SIGN LEE HE'S 
KIND OF HOT 
YOU LIKE HIM HE MAY 
BE UP FOR IT KEVIN I WAS LOOKING 
AT HIM AND I WONDERED WHO HE 
REMINDED ME OF L. THOUGHT IT WAS 
BORIS JOHNSON LAST WEEK BUT IN 
FACT IT'S QUITE CLEAR WHO HE DOES 
LOOK LIKE IT'S HIM ISN'T HE HE'S 
DEFINITELY THE ONLY GAY IN THE 
VILLAGE MICHELLE YOU SAY YOU LIKED 
SIMON L. THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO 
MAKE A FOOL OF HIMSELF BECAUSE 
WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT WHAT 
EXPERIENCE HE HAD IN THE LAUNDRY 
BUSINESS HE CAME UP WITH ONE OF THE 
MOST BIZARRE ANSWERS I THOUGHT I I HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE OF LAUNDRY 
EQUIPMENT IN BOSNIA 
THERE'S NOT 
MANY PEOPLE WHO CAN SAY THAT TO BE 
FAIR DIDN'T HE DO WELL HE JUST 
GOT ON WITH IT PERHAPS DOING 
LAUNDRY UNDER FIRE IS THE TRAINING 
YOU NEED TO PERFORM THIS KIND OF 
TASK 
I THINK HE WAS BRILLIANT THE TASK TALENT THAT WE HAVEN'T SPOTTED HERE 
BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS WAY IN THE U. K. 
OF WRITING OFF ANYBODY WITH A POSH 
ACCENT WAS ACTUALLY RAEF HE 
QUIETLY CREATED AN ATMOSPHERE 
AMONGST THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE WHICH 
WAS FANTASTIC THE FACT THAT I 
THINK SIMON IS A GREAT NUMBER TWO 
BUT IT HAD THAT ALMOST A REVERSE OF 
CAPTAIN MANNERING AND THE SERGEANT 
IT WAS A GREAT COMBINATION THAT 
BUT RAEF TO ME IS THE UNSUNG HERO 
IN THAT EXERCISE 
SUCH A SHOCK 
BECAUSE LAST WEEK HE LOOKED A PRIZE 
IDIOT 
IT SEEMED TO BE A CLASS IDIOT THING RAEF LEADING LIKE THE POSH 
OFFICER WHO DOESN'T ACTUALLY GET 
HIS HANDS DIRTY VERY MUCH THEN 
SIMON DOING THE DONKEY WORK IT WAS 
A TOFFS VERSUS GRAFTERS IF YOU LIKE 
BAD BOYS WHAT YOU GONNA DO 
IF YOU COULD WASH ANYBODY'S CLOTHES 
WHO WOULD IT BE 
YOUR FELLA I'D 
LOVE TO WASH YOUR SMALLS WHAT'S WHAT'S THE PROBLEM

A LONG TIME MATE
