THE NEW CRACKDOWN ON COMPANIES EMPLOYING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS MORE 
THAN A HUNDRED EMPLOYERS FACE 
PROSECUTION AS FOREIGN WORKERS ARE 
DETAINED DETAINED BORIS JOHNSON TAKES UP HIS NEW JOB 
AS MAYOR OF LONDON 
PRINCE HARRY AND THE HOUSEHOLD 
CAVALRY ARE HONOURED FOR THEIR 
SERVICE IN AFGHANISTAN 
AND STRONG WINDS DELAY PLANS TO 
CARRY THE OLYMPIC TORCH TO THE 
SUMMIT OF EVEREST 
GOOD AFTERNOON THERE HAS BEEN A 
DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBERS OF 
EMPLOYERS BEING PROSECUTED FOR 
HIRING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FIGURES 
OBTAINED BY THE B. B. C. SHOW THAT SINCE 
THE LAW WAS CHANGED TWO MONTHS AGO 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN CAUGHT A 
TENFOLD INCREASE ON THE WHOLE OF 
LAST YEAR 
HERE IS OUR SOCIAL AFFAIRS 
CORRESPONDENT ANDREW BOMFORD 
WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO GO IN DOZENS DOZENS OF IMMIGRATION OFFICERS POUR INTO A 
WAREHOUSE PROCESSING CHICKEN IN 
DERBYSHIRE 
O. K. EVERYBODY THIS IS DERBYSHIRE THE UNITED KINGDOM BORDERS AND 
IMMIGRATION AGENCY CAN YOU ALL 
STAND STILL AND PUT YOUR KNIFES 
DOWN 
THE WORKERS ARE CAUGHT DOWN UNAWARES FIFTY SIX ARE LINED UP 
WE ARE 
HERE TO SEE IF ANYBODY IS HERE 
WORKING ILLEGALLY 
TWENTY TWO OF THESE MEN 
ARE IN BRITAIN ILLEGALLY BUT REALLY 
IT'S THE EMPLOYERS THE AUTHORITIES 
ARE MOST INTERESTED IN 
EVEN LARGE 
SCALE OPERATIONS LIKE THIS WILL 
ONLY MAKE THE TINIEST DIFFERENCE TO 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY 
SO THE HOPE IS TO GO AFTER THE 
EMPLOYERS AND THAT'LL MAKE THE 
DIFFERENCE ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE 
HERE TO WORK IF YOU STOP THE WORK 
YOU REMOVE THE FACTOR DRIVING 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION HALF MILLION 
POUNDS IN FINES HAVE BEEN HANDED 
OUT TO EMPLOYERS SO FAR 
INVESTIGATIONS CONTINUE INTO THE 
OTHERS OFFICERS HAVEN'T DECIDED IF 
THE OWNERS OF THIS COMPANY HAVE 
DONE ANYTHING WRONG THE GOVERNMENT 
THINKS THERE ARE UP TO FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND 
IMLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THE COUNTRY 
THOUGH THERE MAY BE MANY MORE BUT 
DEPORTING THEM SEX PENSIVE 
ELEVEN THOUSAND PER PERSON IF THEY CATCH 
THEM THE DEPORTATION BILL COULD BE 
MORE THAN FIVE BILLION 
I AM AFRAID 
WE WILL HAVE TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON 
DEPORTING PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE WE 
DEPORTED SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE LAST YEAR 
ABOUT ONE EVERY EIGHT MINUTES L. 
WANT TO SEE THAT NUMBER GO UP L. 
HAVE SAID WE NEED TO DOUBLE THE 
BUDGET FOR OUR ENFORCEMENT TEAMS 
GOVERNMENT CRITICS WONDER IF THE 
CRACKDOWN IS GENUINE 
I THINK IT'S 
LONG OVERDUE THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS GOT SERIOUS ABOUT PROSECUTING 
EMPLOYERS FRANKLY IT'S BEEN A 
SCANDAL THAT IN PREVIOUS YEARS WE 
HAVE HAD SO FEW PROSECUTIONS ONLY 
THIRTY FOUR IN THE TWO PREVIOUS YEARS TWENTY 
CONVICTIONS 
BUT SOME EMPLOYERS CONVICTIONS BELIEVE THEY HAVE BEEN TREATED 
UNFAIRLY 
OFTEN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS DESTROY 
THEIR PAPERWORK THEIR PASSPORTS 
AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY HAVE 
COME FROM THEY DON'T CO OPERATE 
SOME CAN'T BE RETURNED TO THEIR 
HOME COUNTRY BECAUSE IT'S UNSAFE 
TO DO SO GOVERNMENT HOPES BY 
SENDING OUT A STRONG SIGNAL LIKE 
THIS IT WILL GET THE MESSAGE 
ACROSS THEY ARE CUTTING DOWN THE 
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE 
HOPE THEY WOULDN'T RETURN HERE 
MINISTERS HAVE HINTED THAT 
CONTROVERSIAL POLICIES SUCH AS 
TAXES ON RUBBISH COULD BE DITCH 
FOLLOWING HEAVY LOSSES IN THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS IN LONDON BORIS JOHNSON 
HAS TAKEN OVER THE REINS 
BEN WRIGHT NOW REPORTS 
WELL SORRY WE CLEARLY HAVE 
PROBLEMS WITH ACTUALLY GOING TO 
THAT PIECE WE'LL RETURN TO THAT 
PIECE IN TERMS OF THE POLITICAL 
RAMIFICATIONS FOR GORDON BROWN IN A 
MOMENT OR TWO LET'S MOVE ON 
BECAUSE A MORE RIGOROUS SELECTION 
AND MONITORING OF TEACHERS TO 
IDENTIFY UNDERPERFORMERS IS BEING 
CALLED FOR TO IMPROVE STANDARDS 
THE INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY 
RESEARCH SAYS BAD TEACHERS CAN MEAN 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PUPILS 
FAILING OR PASSING THEIR GCSES 
PRINCE HARRY HAS RECEIVED A 
CAMPAIGN MEDAL FOR SERVICE IN 
AFGHANISTAN THE MEDAL WAS PINNED 
TO HIS CHEST BY HIS AUNT THE 
PRINCESS ROYAL AT A CEREMONY IN 
WINDSOR HIS GIRLFRIEND CHELSY 
DAVY AND HIS BROTHER PRINCE 
WILLIAM LOOKED ON LET'S GO TO JON 
BRAIN WHO IS AT WINDSOR FOR US 
OVER TO YOU 
MATTHEW MOST PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW 
PRINCE HARRY WAS IN AFGHANISTAN 
UNTIL THE MEDIA BLACKOUT COLLAPSED 
AND HE WAS ON HIS WAY HOME BUT 
HE'S DESCRIBED IT AS ONE OF THE 
BEST EXPERIENCES OF HIS LIFE AND 
TODAY HE AND HIS FELLOW SOLDIERS 
HAVE BEEN HONOURED FOR THE WORK 
THEY DID THERE 
A PROUD MOMENT FOR A YOUNG PRINCE 
WHO FEARED HE'D NEVER BE ALLOWED TO 
EXPERIENCE COMBAT BUT IT'S HARD TO 
KEEP A STRAIGHT FACE WHEN IT'S YOUR 
OWN AUNT PRESENTING THE MEDALS 
WATCHED BY GIRL FRIEND CHELSY AND 
BROTHER WILLIAM PRINCE HARRY WAS 
ONE OF ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD 
CAVALRY HONOURED BY THE PRINCESS 
ROYAL TODAY FOR THEIR SERVICE IN 
ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS 
PLACES PLACES 
PRINCE HARRY SPENT TEN WEEKS IN 
HELMAND PROVINCE IN SOUTHERN 
AFGHANISTAN TAKING PART IN THE 
FIGHT AGAINST THE TALEBAN HE LIVED 
AND WORKED LESS THAN HALF A MILE 
FROM THE FRONTLINE HIS MAIN JOB 
WAS AS A FORWARD AIR CONTROLLER 
CALLING IN STRIKES AGAINST ENEMY 
POSITIONS BUT HE WAS BROUGHT HOME 
EARLY AFTER A MEDIA BLACKOUT BROKE 
DOWN IT WAS FELT HIS CONTINUING 
PRESENCE WOULD CREATE AN 
UNACCEPTABLE EXTRA RISK FOR HIS 
COLLEAGUES 
AFTER THE MEDAL CEREMONY PRINCE 
HARRY AND HIS FELLOW SOLDIERS 
MARCHED FROM THE BARRACKS TO THE 
LOCAL CHURCH THEY'RE NOW TAKING 
PART IN A SERVICE OF REMEMBRANCE 
FOR THOSE TROOPS WHO DIDN'T MAKE IT 
HOME FROM AFGHANISTAN 
WELL ALL THIS OF COURSE HELPS 
PRINCE HARRY SHED THAT IMAGE OF THE 
PARTY PRINCE AND BE TAKEN MORE 
SERIOUSLY BUT IT'S ALSO VERY 
POSITIVE FOR THE ARMY THEY SAY 
THAT DESPITE THE COMPLICATIONS OF 
HIS DEPLOYMENT TO HELMAND PROVINCE 
IT'S ACTUALLY RAISED CONSCIOUSNESS 
OF THE BRITISH MISSION IN 
AFGHANISTAN AND HELPED EXPLAIN IT 
TO THE PUBLIC MATHEW 
JON THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WELL LET'S RETURN TO POLITICS NOW 
AND THE FALL OUT FROM THE LOCAL 
ELECTION RESULTS LET'S RETURN TO 
THAT PIECE FROM OUR POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT BEN WRIGHT 
THE FIRST DAY AT THE OFFICE FOR 
LONDON'S NEW MAYOR 
USER NAME WHAT'S MY USER NAME 
JOHNSON 
IT'S PROBABLY B. JOHNSON JOHNSON TECHNOLOGY'S MOVED ON BIT SINCE 
NINETEEN NINETY TWO THE LAST TIME THE 
CONSERVATIVES HAD SUCH AN IMPORTANT 
WIN AT THE POLLS BORIS JOHNSON WAS 
THE BIGGEST WINNER FROM LABOUR'S 
CURRENT WOE AND AS HE SETTLES INTO 
HIS NEW OFFICE LABOUR POLITICIANS 
HAD BEEN WORKING OUT HOW THEY MIGHT 
HANG ONTO THEIRS YESTERDAY THE 
PRIME MINISTER RESOLVED TO LISTEN 
TO THE CONCERNS OF VOTERS AND LAY 
OUT HIS VISION FOR THE COUNTRY 
TODAY THERE'S SPECULATIONABLE 
POSSIBLE POLICY CHANGES WHICH COULD 
INVOLVE SCRAPPING PLANS TO CHARGE 
HOUSEHOLDS ACCORDING TO HOW MUCH 
RUBBISH THEY THROW OUT LABOUR M. P.'S 
RETURN TO WESTMINSTER TOMORROW AND 
FOR THE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE 
DIFFICULT HURDLES AHEAD FOLLOWING 
THE DEATH OF GWYNETH DUNWITTY THERE 
WILL BE A CREW AND NANTWITCH VOTE 
THE CONSERVATIVES ARE CONFIDENT 
THAT GOVERNMENT DEFEAT COULD BE 
ON THE CARDS AND LABOUR M. P.'S LED BY 
FRANK FIELD ARE KEEPING UP THE 
PRESSURE ON THE GOVERNMENT TO 
PRODUCE COMPREHENSIVE FULLY BACK 
DATED COMPENSATION PACKAGE FOR 
PEOPLE WHO LOST OUT FROM THE 
SCRAPPED TEN P. TAX RATE 
THERE WAS A 
VERY STRONG FEELING THAT GORDON 
BROWN IS THE RIGHT PERSON TO TAKE 
US FORWARD HE HAS BEEN THE MOST 
SUCCESSFUL CHANCELLOR WE HAVE HAD 
IN MODERN TIMES HE'S THE RIGHT 
PERSON WITH A STEADY HAND ON THAT 
TILLER AT THE TIME OF ECONOMIC 
TURBULENCE AND I THINK WHEN WE GET 
THROUGH THIS PEOPLE WILL LOOK BACK 
AND SAY HE WAS THE RIGHT MAN IN THE 
RIGHT PLACE AND THEY'LL HAVE TO 
MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN THAT AND THE 
ALTERNATIVE WHICH I DON'T THINK IS 
A VERY ATTRACTIVE ONE 
BUT THE 
ALTERNATIVE IS NOW WINNING 
ELECTIONS AND MAPPING ITS PATH FOIR 
LABOUR HAS ITS WORK CUT OUT TRYING 
TO STOP THEM 
PRISON OFFICERS ARE CLAIMING THE 
DANGEROUS CRIMINALS ARE BEING SENT 
TO OPEN PRISONS BECAUSE OF 
OVERCROWDING IN SECURE JAILS THE 
B. B. C.'S PANORAMA PROGRAMME HAS 
DISCOVERED THERE HAVE BEEN MORE 
THAN FOURTEEN THOUSAND CASES OF INMATES 
WALKING OUT OF OPEN PRISONS OR 
FAILING TO RETURN FROM HOME LEAVE 
IN THE PAST TEN YEARS 
THIS IS RICHARD MCDONALD A MAN 
WITH A VIOLENT CRIMINAL HISTORY AND 
KNOWN TO THE POLICE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR 
C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE SHOWS MCDONALD AND AN 
ACCOMPLICE ROBBING SIDENHAM RAILWAY 
STATION IN LONDON THEY FOLLOW 
STAFF INTO THE CASH OFFICE WHILE 
ONE BEATS A MAN WITH A GUN THE 
OTHER HOLDS A BUTCHER'S KNIFE TO A 
WOMAN'S THROAT THEY LEAVE WITH 
EIGHT THOUSAND WHEN POLICE REVIEWED THE 
VIDEO FOOTAGE THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE 
WHAT THEY WERE SEEING 
THE C. C. T. V. WAS 
SHOWN TO ONE OF THE ROBBERY SQUAD 
OFFICERS WHO WAS ON THE SQUAD IN 
NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND HE IDENTIFIED THE ROBBER 
AS BEING MR. MCDONALD WHICH IS MOST 
SURPRISING BECAUSE WE BELIEVED HE 
WAS IN PRISON SERVING FOR ROBBERIES 
ON THE RAILWAY AT THAT TIME IN IN FACT MCDONALD HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED 
TO FORD OPEN PRISON IN WEST SUSSEX 
HE'D SIMPLY WALKED OUT PRISON 
OFFICERS SAY THE TRANSFER OF 
UNSUITABLE PRISONERS IS A GROWING 
TREND THAT'S PUTTING THE PUBLIC AT 
RISK 
THERE'S NO DOUBT FROM THE RISK INFORMATION I'M RECEIVING FROM MY 
MEMBERS THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE 
WRONG PRISONERS THE WRONG INMATES 
THE WRONG OFFENDERS WHICHEVER 
EXPRESSION YOU WANT TO USE INTO 
THE OPENING STATE THAT IS BEING 
CAUSED BY THE OVERCROWDING 
SITUATION WE HAVE BOTH IN SCOTLAND 
AND IN ENGLAND AND WALES 
WITH A 
RECORD U. K. PRISON POPULATION OF MORE 
THAN NINETY THOUSAND HARRY FLETCHER OF THE 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF PROBATION 
OFFICERS IS ALSO CONCERNED 
I HAVE 
CERTAIN BY BEEN WORRIED FOR FIFTEEN EIGHTEEN 
MONTHS THAT INDIVIDUALS WERE BEING 
TRANSFERRED INTO OPEN JAILS IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES WHO DID POSE A 
RISK TO THE PUBLIC AND THE REASON 
I BELIEVE THAT IS BECAUSE MEMBERS 
OF MY ORGANISATION WORKING IN 
PRISONS AND IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE 
TOLD ME THAT THAT'S THE CASE 
IN A 
STATEMENT JUSTICE SECRETARY JACK 
STRAW INSISTED THAT PUBLIC SAFETY 
WAS PARAMOUNT BUT THOSE AT THE 
COAL FACE REMAIN WORRIED THAT COAL 
FACES LIKE THAT OF RICHARD MCDONALD 
WILL OCCUR AGAIN 
YOU CAN SEE MORE ON THAT 
INVESTIGATION IN PANORAMA PRISONS 
UNLOCKED TONIGHT AT EIGHT THIRTY P. M. ON B. B. C. 
ONE ONE THE UNITED NATIONS SAYS SEVERAL 
HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE STILL 
WITHOUT SHELTER AND CLEAN DRINKING 
WATER IN BURMA AFTER A CYCLONE HIT 
THE COUNTRY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE WERE KILLED 
BY THE STORM SOME AID IS NOW 
GETTING THROUGH TO THE VICTIMS BUT 
LARGE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY HAVE 
BEEN DECLARED A DISASTER ZONE 
NOW THE OLYMPIC TORCH HAS HAD A 
DIFFICULT JOURNEY AROUND THE WORLD 
AND NOW CHINA'S PLAN TO TAKE THE 
FLAME TO THE TOP OF EVEREST WELL 
IT'S ALSO RUN INTO PROBLEMS BECAUSE 
HIGH WINDS ARE HOLDING UP AN 
ATTEMPT TO CARRY THE TORCH TO THE 
SUMMIT OUR CORRESPONDENT IS AMONG 
A GROUP OF JOURNALISTS ALLOWED INTO 
TIBET BY THE CHINESE AUTHORITYS FOR 
A CAREFULLY MANAGED TRIP TO THE 
BASE OF M. T. EVEREST 
WORRIED ABOUT PROTESTS CHINA HAS 
SHUT DOWN THE M. T. EVEREST REGION 
BUT IT CAN'T CONTROL THE WEATHER 
HIGH WINDS ARE STOPPING THE FLAME 
CARRIERS FROM MAKING AN ATTEMPT ON 
THE SUMMIT CHINA DOESN'T MAKE IT 
EASY FOR REPORTERS TO VISIT TIBET 
BUT IT DESPERATELY WANTS THE WORLD 
TO WITNESS ITS MOMENT OF GLORY SO 
WE WERE INVITED TO BE PART OF A 
GROUP OF JOURNALISTS ON A CAREFULLY 
ROUTED TRIP THROUGH TIBET TO M. T. 
EVEREST CHINA SAYS NORMALITY HAS 
RETURNED TO LHASA AFTER LAST 
MONTH'S RIOTS BUT WE WERE KEPT 
AWAY FROM THE TIBETAN CAPITAL 
WELCOME THIS IS JONAH FISHER FROM 
THE B. B. C. 
WE WERE TAKEN TO THE HOME 
OF AN ILLITERATE SIXTY THREE YEAR OLD 
FARMER NOW THANKS TO THE CHINESE 
THE OWN OVER A LARGE HOUSE HIS 
LIKE ALL WE SAW ALONG THE ROAD 
SPORTED THE NATIONAL FLAG A 
VOLUNTARY MEASURE HE SAYS AS HE'S 
SO EXCITED ABOUT THE COMING 
OLYMPICS MONKS WERE AT THE CENTRE 
OF THE UNREST IN MARCH SO THIS 
SMALL MONASTERY PERCHED FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
METRES ABOVE SEA LEVEL WAS AT 
LEAST TOPICAL 
WHAT'S HIS NAME 
INSIDE AS EXPECTED PICTURES OF 
THE TENTH AND ELEVENTH LAMAS HAD PRIDE 
OF PLACE IT'S ILLEGAL TO DISPLAY 
AN IMAGE OF THE EXILED DALAI LAMA 
HERE 
WHAT DOES HE THINK OF THE HERE MONKS WHO DID RIOT IN LHASA 
IT'S NOT A PROPER MANNER FOR A LAMA IT'S NOT RIGHT 
IT WAS CONSIDERING THE CHINESE 
OFFICIALS WITH US AT THE MONASTERY 
AN IMPOSSIBLE QUESTION WE HAVE 
BEEN BROUGHT HERE FOR JUST ONE 
REASON IT'S NOT TO TALK ABOUT 
HUMAN RIGHTS OR LIFE IN TIBET IT'S 
TO TELL THE WORLD ABOUT THE MOMENT 
WHEN CHINA TAKES THE OLYMPIC TORCH 
TO THE TOP OF THE WORLD'S TALLEST 
MOUNTAIN WHICH IS CURRENTLY 
LURKING BEHIND THAT HUGE CLOUD 
AFTER THE OLYMPIC TORCH'S TROUBLED 
JOURNEY AROUND THE WORLD CHINA 
BADLY NEEDS THE EVEREST CLIMB TO BE 
A SPECTACULAR SUCCESS 
THAT'S IT FOR NOW THERE WILL BE
