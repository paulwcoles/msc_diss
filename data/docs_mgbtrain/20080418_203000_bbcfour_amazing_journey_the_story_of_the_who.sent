THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS STRONG LANGUAGE 
WHO 
WHATEVER HAPPENED THAT DAY WHEN KEITH MOON JOINED JOHN PETE AND MYSELF ON THE STAGE 
SOMETHING HAPPENED 
THERE ARE BILLIONS OF PEOPLE ON THIS PLANET 
WHAT THE FUCK PUT FOUR TOTAL INDIVIDUALS TOGETHER 
ON THE STAGE IN GREENFORD TO MAKE THIS MUSIC 
WHAT THE FUCK DID THAT 
I'LL NEVER SMILE AGAIN BY JOE LOSS AND HIS ORCHESTRA 
TOWARDS THE END OF THE WAR EVERYTHING WAS SECRET 
YOU NEVER KNEW WHETHER YOU WERE WINNING OR LOSING 
MOST OF THE TIME THEY WERE SAYING YOU WERE WINNING WHEN YOU FELT THAT YOU WERE LOSING 
I WAS BORN INTO THAT WORLD 
I WAS BORN IN THE HOUR THAT ALBERT SPEER WAS ARRESTED 
HE WAS HITLER'S PREMIER ARCHITECT I DON'T MEAN WAR ARCHITECT 
HE WAS AN ACTUAL ARCHITECT 
MY FATHER GOT THESE TWO MESSAGES ONE WAS SPEER'S BEEN CAPTURED 
THE OTHER WAS IT'S A BOY MR. TOWNSEND 
I'LL NEVER SMILE AGAIN 
WHEN I THINK ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD IN THE LATE FORTIES FIFTIES 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE WORLD WAS BLACK AND WHITE IT'S VERY WEIRD 
VERY SPARTAN LIVING 
WE WERE STILL ON FOOD RATIONING 
NO CARS IN THE STREET 
AFTER THE WAR THERE WAS LIKE BOMBED OUT BUILDINGS THAT HAD LOADS OF BRICKS 
WE DIDN'T NEED LEGO WE HAD THE REAL THING 
PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY THAT I GREW UP WITH 
IF THEY WERE WILD AND CRAZY AND WEIRD OR IN A BAND 
THE CHANCES WERE THAT THEY HAD SOME WEIRD SHIT HAPPEN TO THEM WHEN THEY WERE KIDS 
MY PARENTS WERE BOTH WORKING DANCE BAND MUSICIANS 
I GREW UP WITH THE MUSIC OF MY FATHER 
WHICH WAS THE BASIE BAND THE ELLINGTON BAND 
AND GREAT SINGERS LIKE SARAH VAUGHAN AND SINATRA 
AND ELLA FITZGERALD 
I FELT I COULDN'T EVEN BEGIN TO EMULATE OR OCCUPY THEIR TERRITORY 
WE WERE ALL INTERESTED IN TRADITIONAL JAZZ AT THE TIME 
TO ME TRAD JAZZ WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALREADY A REBELLIOUS THREAT 
TO THE KIND OF SERENE DANCE HALL DANCE MUSIC THAT MY FATHER PLAYED 
THE FIRST CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FOUR TALENTS OF THE WHO 
CAME IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE 
AT A WEST LONDON BOYS' SCHOOL 
I MET JOHN AT ACTON COUNTY GRAMMAR SCHOOL 
BIG GUY FUNNY VERY SHARPLY DRESSED 
JOHN AND PETE DIDN'T REALLY GET TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER WELL 
UNTIL THEY STARTED UP PLAYING INSTRUMENTS TOGETHER 
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING AND RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH OUR LIFE 
HE WAS A GREAT MUSICAL ALLY 
YOU'RE JOHN YOU'RE JOHN 
AND YOU'RE FROM LONDON TOO 
FROM LONDON TOO YEAH 
HE WAS CALLING HIMSELF JOHN ALLISON 
BECAUSE HIS GIRLFRIEND WAS CALLED ALISON 
WE THOUGHT ENTWISTLE WAS A REALLY STRANGE NAME FOR A BAND MEMBER 
AND WE TRIED JOHN BROWN 
AND WE THOUGHT NO HE'S JOHN ENTWISTLE 
THE WHO WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE WHO WITHOUT ENTWISTLE 
HE WOULD FILL THE SOUND UP WITH THE BASS 
IF YOU LISTEN TO ANY WHO RECORD 
AND YOU ISOLATE THE BASS 
WHAT HE DOES IS ASTONISHING 
IT ISN'T WHAT A NORMAL BASS PLAYER WOULD DO 
SUMMERTIME BLUES 
ENTWISTLE STOOD STILL 
YOU HAD PETE SWINGING HIS ARM ROUND LIKE A WINDMILL 
YOU HAD ROGER THROWING HIS MICROPHONE AROUND KEITH SMACKING AWAY AT THE DRUMS 
AND DAD STOOD IN THE CORNER PLAYING QUIETLY 
THE BOSS SAID 
SON YOU GOTTA WORK LATE 
I USED TO GET CROSS THAT THEY DIDN'T SHOW JOHN SO MUCH ON THE TELEVISION 
THE CAMERAS WERE ALWAYS ON PETE AND ROGER 
HE WAS LIKE A CENTRAL PLANK IN A SPINNING ROOM 
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT HE WAS DOING 
HE WAS PLAYING LIKE A BACH ORGAN IT WAS HUGE MASSIVE RICH SOUND 
SO I USED TO FIND MY WAY INSIDE THERE 
I USED TO SIT WITH JOHN AND SIT INSIDE AND HE WOULD FOLLOW ME AND SUPPORT ME 
AND WE'D PLAY TOGETHER 
JOHN HAD SUCH FACILITY AS A PLAYER AND REALLY VERY UNIQUE 
I DON'T THINK ANYONE HAD REALLY GOT INTO LEAD BASS PLAYING 
HE WASN'T ACTUALLY A QUIET GUY HE WAS JUST A VERY SARDONIC GUY 
VERY CYNICAL 
HE WAS VERY FUNNY 
BUT IN THAT SORT OF LAID BACK WAY 
ENTWISTLE WAS UNCOMPROMISING 
IN LEADING HIS OWN LIFE 
I'M AFRAID JOHN TAKES AFTER ME 
I LOVE MUSIC DANCING ENJOYING MYSELF 
DRINKING I LOVE PARTYING 
I NEVER EVER FELT THAT JOHN HAD ANY ADDICTIVE PROBLEMS AT ALL 
EXCEPT ONE WHICH BEGAN WITH AN H. 
IT'S A BIG SHOP IN LONDON CALLED HARRODS 
THAT WAS HIS ONE ADDICTION 
HE COULD NEVER BUY ONE PAIR OF SHOES HE ALWAYS BOUGHT A DOZEN 
IN EACH COLOUR AND THE SHIRTS AND THE TROUSERS 
HE WAS CERTAINLY WELL DRESSED 
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SKELETON FUCKING LEATHER THING 
THAT JOHN ENTWISTLE WHAT'S THAT ABOUT 
HE WAS VERY MUSICAL RIGHT FROM THE AGE OF THREE 
HE KNEW ALL THE POP SONGS THAT WERE IN THE CHARTS 
HE'D SING FOR HOURS 
MY FIRST DATE WITH JOHN WAS TO GO TO A BOYS' BRIGADE THING AT THE ALBERT HALL 
HE USED TO PLAY THE BUGLE 
HE JOINED THE SCHOOL ORCHESTRA 
HE WANTED TO PLAY THE TRUMPET BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY LEFT 
THE ONLY INSTRUMENT LEFT WAS THE FRENCH HORN 
HE PRACTISED IN THE LOO HE BECAME QUITE PROFICIENT 
JOHN ENTWISTLE WAS THE ONLY ONE OF US THAT KIND OF HAD ANY MUSICAL TRAINING 
HE MADE HIS FIRST BASS WITH HIS OWN HANDS 
WHAT HE REALISED WAS THAT HE HAD THE POWER 
TO CHANGE 
THE FUCKING INSTRUMENT 
YOU DON'T CHANGE THE TRUMPET BUT THE BASS GUITAR WAS RELATIVELY NEW 
HE STARTED TO PLAY IT DIFFERENTLY HOLD IT DIFFERENTLY 
BEING ON STAGE WITH A GUITAR WITH A BIG AMPLIFIER 
IT BECAME HIS VOICE 
I WAS WALKING DOWN THE ROAD ONE DAY COMING HOME FROM WORK 
I WORKED IN THE SHEET METALWORK FACTORY 
I NOTICED THIS GUY COMING TOWARDS ME I RECOGNISED HIM FROM BEING AT SCHOOL AND ACROSS HIS SHOULDER 
HE'S GOT THIS STRANGE LOOKING INSTRUMENT 
I SAID TO HIM STUPIDLY WHAT YOU GOT THERE 
HE SAID IT'S A BASS 
THEY ALL WENT TO THE SAME SCHOOL ROGER WAS AT THE SAME SCHOOL BUT HE GOT EXPELLED 
I THINK HE WAS ACCUSED OF SETTING FIRE TO THE SCHOOL 
ROGER WAS A BIT OF A TEARAWAY 
IT'S BEEN SAID THAT I WAS A BULLY LATER ON IN MY SCHOOL CAREER I DON'T THINK I ACTUALLY WAS 
I JUST LOVED TO FIGHT 
STILL DO 
WHEN I FIRST MET ROGER HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL CHARISMATIC AND LITERALLY POWERFUL MEN I'D MET 
HE WAS LIKE ELVIS PRESLEY 
ELVIS TO ME WAS THE GUY I WANTED TO BE BUT REALISTICALLY THE GUY WHO SHOWED ME THAT I COULD 
INSTEAD OF JUST DREAMING ABOUT THIS 
I COULD ACTUALLY GO OUT THERE AND DO IT WAS A GUY CALLED LONNIE DONEGAN 
SWEET SIXTEEN 
GOES TO CHURCH 
JUST TO SEE THE BOYS 
LONNIE DONEGAN WAS A BIG INFLUENCE 
IT'S THE RHYTHM THE BEAT AND THE FRESHNESS OF IT 
ONLY PUTTING ON THE STYLE 
YEAH PUTTING ON THE AGONY 
PUTTING ON THE STYLE 
IT HAD THAT KIND OF ROCK'N'ROLL PACE TO IT 
SKIFFLE IS REALLY BASICALLY EARLY AMERICAN FOLK SONGS 
ANYONE COULD MAKE A SKIFFLE GROUP YOU COULD DO IT WITH HOME OBJECTS 
FOR DRUMS WE HAD AN OLD WASHING BOARD 
TEA CHEST BASS WHICH WAS A TEA CHEST WITH A PIECE OF STRING AND BROOMSTICK 
IT LIFTED THE MUSIC FROM BIG BANDS INTO PEOPLE'S PARLOURS YOU COULD DO IT YOURSELF 
EVERY STREET IN SHEPHERDS BUSH HAD ITS OWN SKIFFLE GROUP 
ON FIELDING ROAD ROGER DALTREY FOUNDED THE DETOURS 
WITH A GUITAR HE MADE HIMSELF AT THE SHEET METAL FACTORY 
AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN HE WAS THE KING OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD 
SO ANYWAY I'M WALKING HOME FROM WORK ONE NIGHT AND IMMEDIATELY I KIND OF FELT I'M BONDING WITH THIS GUY 
I SAID ARE YOU IN A BAND HE SAID YEAH I'M IN A BAND 
I SAID WELL HAVE YOU GOT ANY WORK 
HE SAID NO 
I SAID WELL WE HAVE DO YOU GET PAID FOR YOUR WORK HE SAID NO 
I SAID WE DO 
I WAS LYING 
I SAID WELL YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING FOR A BASS PLAYER WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN 
SHORTLY AFTER REG BOWEN ON RHYTHM GUITAR LEFT THE BAND 
JOHN SAID WELL I KNOW SOMEONE WHO'S A GOOD RHYTHM PLAYER 
SO WE SAID WELL BRING HIM ALONG 
JOHN WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME BECAUSE HE NEVER LET ME GO 
HE COULD HAVE DONE A COUPLE OF THE OTHER GUYS DID LET ME GO JOHN WAS VERY ENCOURAGING TO ME 
AND NURTURING AND USED TO CONSTANTLY SAY TO ME 
NO YOU'RE A GOOD MUSICIAN 
HE WAS JUST VITAL TO ME IN THOSE DAYS 
BY NINETEEN SIXTY TWO THE DETOURS WERE PLAYING PUBS AS A FIVE PIECE 
JOHN ON BASS DOUG SANDOM ON THE DRUMS 
PETE PLAYED RHYTHM GUITAR COLIN DAWSON SINGING 
ROGER PLAYING LEAD GUITAR IT WAS ROGER'S BAND 
THE DETOURS WERE ROGER'S BAND AND ROGER WAS THE DRIVING FORCE 
ROGER SUPPLIED THE ENERGY HE DROVE THE VAN AND ARRANGED EVERYTHING 
SOME WAY SOME DAY 
I'LL FIND A WAY TO MAKE YOU SEE MY WAY 
IN SIXTY THREE ROGER GAVE UP THE GUITAR FIRED THE SINGER AND TOOK OVER AS FRONT MAN 
WHEN THERE WAS JUST THE THREE OF US 
AS A BAND JUST TWO INSTRUMENTS PETE AND JOHN 
THE ONLY THING WITH STRINGS WAS PETE AND JOHN 
I REMEMBER SAYING TO HIM THE SOUND'S FUCKING GREAT 
YOU SEE MY WAY 
OH YEAH 
OH YEAH 
EVERYTHING GONNA BE ALL RIGHT THIS MORNIN' 
ALL THE OTHER GUYS IN THE BAND WERE WORKING FOR A LIVING AND I WAS AT ART SCHOOL I WAS ON A GRANT 
I WAS HAVING AN EASY LIFE I WAS SMOKING DOPE LISTENING TO RECORDS 
I MET PETE WHEN WE WERE IN ART SCHOOL 
AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE WAS IN A BAND 
WE GOT THIS FLAT THAT HAD BELONGED TO THIS AMERICAN GUY TOM WRIGHT 
TOM WRIGHT HAD A HUGE BLUES ARCHIVE FROM THE STATES 
NOW WHEN I WAS A YOUNG BOY 
AFTER THE AGE OF FIVE 
ALL THAT EARLY BLUES STUFF JOHN LEE HOOKER HOWLIN' WOLF JIMMY REED 
ALL THOSE YOUNG KIDS LOVED THE BLUES 
BECAUSE THE WORKING CLASSES WERE IN A SIMILAR SOCIOLOGICAL POSITION 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN TO THE BLACKS IN AMERICA 
MY FATHER WAS IN THE WAR 
HIS SHIP GETS TORPEDOED MY MOTHER WHO IS PREGNANT 
GOES TO THE SHIPPING OFFICE AS SHE DID EVERY WEEK TO GET HIS SALARY 
AND THEY SAY OH THERE'S NO SALARY THIS WEEK MRS. STAMP 
THE SHIP'S GONE DOWN 
RIGHT SO THAT WAS THE STATUS OF THE WORKING CLASS 
WELL IT'S A SHAME SHAME SHAME 
SHAME SHAME ON YOU 
WE IDENTIFIED WITH AMERICAN BLUES 
AND THOSE EARLY BLACK AMERICAN ARTISTS 
WE LISTENED TO THAT AND THOUGHT OH THIS IS GREAT 
AND WE STARTED PLAYING THE BLUES I PLAYED THE HARMONICA 
THROUGH THAT MUSIC WE BECAME AWARE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF OUR DRUMMER 
DOUG SANDOM WAS FIRED IN APRIL OF NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR 
WELL IT'S A SHAME ON YOU 
SO WE GOT A SESSION DRUMMER IN FOR A COUPLE OF GIGS WE HAD LINED UP 
AND WE WERE PLAYING ONE NIGHT AT THE OLDFIELD HOTEL IN GREENFORD 
ALL I REMEMBER IS THAT I WAS STANDING ON STAGE GETTING READY TO TAKE A BREAK 
WHEN A. 
GINGERBREAD MAN APPEARED IN THE AUDIENCE IN FRONT OF ME 
LOOKING UP AT ME WITH HIS GREAT BIG PUPPY DOG BROWN EYES 
HE WANTED TO BE A BEACH BOY SO HE'D BOUGHT SOME HYDROGEN PEROXIDE 
AND BLEACHED HIS HAIR AND IT HAD COME OUT BRIGHT ORANGE 
HE CAME UP AND WITH ALL THE ARROGANCE IN THE WORLD SAID 
I HEAR YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A DRUMMER WELL I'M MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONE YOU'VE GOT 
HE SAT DOWN AND PETE STARTS THE PICK SCREECHING DOWN THE STRING 
AND HE GETS INTO A VERY HEAVY RIFT 
ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S LIKE A JET ENGINE HAS STARTED UP AT THE BACK OF ME 
IT WAS LIKE MAGIC 
ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYTHING WORKED 
WE WERE JUST ASTONISHED THIS KID WAS THE MISSING LINK 
AND IT WAS OBVIOUS FROM THE FIRST MINUTE OF HIM PLAYING WITH US 
THE WHOLE DANCE FLOOR STOPPED AND STARTED LOOKING IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY 
HE WAS THE ONLY DRUMMER I KNOW THAT YOU'D WATCH 
MOON WAS A STAR 
HE WAS A SHOOTING STAR THAT'S WHAT HE WAS 
HE WAS CLEARLY AN ALCOHOLIC 
AN ADDICT A SEX ADDICT 
WHO ARE YOU 
WHO WHO WHO WHO 
ON THE ONE HAND HE WAS THIS LUNATIC WHO YOU KNOW 
COULDN'T WAIT TO GET ON A DRUM KIT AND JUST EXPLODE 
WHO ARE YOU 
ON THE OTHER HAND HE WAS A VERY QUIET SILENT PERSON 
WHO ARE YOU 
HE CLEARLY HAD TREMENDOUS ESTEEM ISSUE PROBLEMS 
HE WAS A COMPLEX LITTLE BALL OF DIFFICULTY 
LEAVE AND GET DRUNK 
HE WASN'T LIKE THAT AS A BOY THAT'S WHAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HE ALWAYS DID AS HE WAS TOLD 
HE WAS VERY QUIET I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH HIM AT ALL 
HE WAS A GOOD BOY 
BY THE TIME HE WAS SIXTEEN MOON WAS PLAYING AMERICAN SURF MUSIC 
IN A BAND CALLED THE BEACHCOMBERS 
THE BEACHCOMBERS WAS THE FIRST BAND THAT I REMEMBER HIM HAVING AT HOME 
IN THE FRONT ROOM 
KEITH LIKED THE BEACH BOYS I DIDN'T LIKE THEM 
FUN FUN FUN TILL HER DADDY TAKES THE T. BIRD AWAY 
OOH WOOOH AND THEY WOULD SING AWAY 
BARBARA A. N. N. B. A. B. A. B. A. BARBARA A. N. N. 
BARBARA A. N. N. B. A. B. A. B. A. B. A. BARBARA A. N. N. 
YOU GOT ME ROCKING AND A ROLLIN' ROCKING AND A REELIN' 
BARBARA A. N. N. HE LIKED THOSE BACKING VOCALS 
THE GIRLIE BACKING VOCALS IN A LOT OF THE SONGS 
THE OTHER THING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT OF COURSE IS THAT KEITH WAS A VERY LYRICAL DRUMMER 
KEITH WAS LIKE AN ORCHESTRA ON DRUMS HE WASN'T A TIME DRUMMER 
LIKE DUM DUM IT WAS ALL AROUND THE KIT 
MOON WAS DOING THINGS THAT JUST MADE US ALL WORK ONE HUNDRED PER CENT HARDER 
NOT FASTER NOT SLOWER 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT HARDER 
IN LATE APRIL NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR HE JOINED THE DETOURS 
AND STARTED PLAYING THE BLUES 
HEY FELLAS HAVE YOU HEARD THE NEWS 
WHEN YOU'VE GOT A TWELVE BAR SEQUENCE IT CAN BECOME MONOTONOUS 
MOONIE HAD A VERY SHORT ATTENTION SPAN WHEN IT CAME TO BOREDOM 
HE STARTED TO DOUBLE UP THE BEAT 
AND THAT LED TO PETE DOUBLING THE GUITAR 
IT LED JOHN TO PLAY MORE JAZZY BITS IN BETWEEN 
AND FROM THAT WHAT WE BECAME FAMOUS FOR EVOLVED 
THAT'S WHEN THE WHO STARTED TO HAVE ITS OWN IDENTITY 
WE PLAYED THE BLUES BUT WE'D PUT OUR OWN STAMP ON IT 
WE'D BEEN THE DETOURS FOR QUITE A WHILE 
AND WE'D BUILT UP QUITE A FOLLOWING IN WEST LONDON ON THE PUB CIRCUIT 
JOHN ENTWISTLE HAD HEARD ABOUT THIS BAND WHO'D GOT A RECORD OUT IN AMERICA CALLED THE DETOURS 
SO WE SAT AROUND AND HAD THIS THINK TANK IN SUNNYSIDE ROAD WHERE BARNEY AND I HAD A FLAT 
THE BAND NEVER CAME BACK THERE THEY'D NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE 
COS PETE AND I WERE ART STUDENTS SMOKING DOPE AND THEY DIDN'T APPROVE 
AND WE WERE JUST JOKINGLY THROWING NAMES AROUND 
WE WERE TRYING TO BE AVANT GARDE THINKING OF LIKE THE NOTHING AND NAMES LIKE THAT 
I CAME UP WITH THE HAIR 
COS EVERYTHING WAS ABOUT HAIR AT THE TIME 
AND I SAID THE WHO COS BASICALLY I WAS JUST THINKING OF IT ON POSTERS 
YOU KNOW IT WAS ONE OF THOSE VERY QUICK CONVERSATIONS THE HAIR THE WHO 
AND EVERYBODY WAS LAUGHING AT EACH ONE 
IT WENT ON FOR A WHILE IT WAS A BIT OF A WAR WELL WE COULD CALL IT THE HAIR AND THE WHO 
IT SOUNDED LIKE A PUB 
BUT THE WHO WAS SOMETHING WE CAME BACK TO 
IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG FOR US TO CARRY OUR AUDIENCE INTO THE CHANGE 
WITHIN TWO WEEKS THEY'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE DETOURS 
AND THEY KNEW IT WAS THE WHO 
BUT I JUST CAN'T EXPLAIN 
WE WERE THE FIRST TEENAGERS AFTER THE WAR 
ALL WE WANTED TO DO WAS 
JUST LIBERATE OURSELVES REALLY AND HAVE FUN 
SOUTH COAST POLICE HAVE WARNED THAT IF THE FIGHTS 
BETWEEN RIVAL GANGS OF MODS AND ROCKERS CONTINUE 
WE USED TO GO TO BRIGHTON AREAS LIKE THAT 
AND IT WAS TRADITIONAL THAT YOU WOULD END UP CLASHING 
WE WERE TEENAGERS TOGETHER WE WERE MODS 
IT WAS ALL ABOUT POP ART GANG CULTURE 
WE WERE CALLED MODS COS WE WERE MODERNIST 
THERE WAS A TYPE OF LIKE FUCK YOU REBELLIOUS SORT OF BEHAVIOUR ABOUT THE MOD KIDS 
IT WAS VERY MUCH LET'S GET OUT OF THIS CLASS SYSTEM 
THE ORIGINAL MODS WERE VERY SMART 
SHORT ITALIAN JACKETS 
TIGHT TROUSERS WINKLE PICKER SHOES A PERFECTLY TAILORED SORT OF SKIN TIGHT SHARK SKIN SUIT 
WITH A LITTLE MASCARA ON AND HIS SPECIAL HAIRCUT ON SATURDAY NIGHTS 
WE SPENT ALL OF OUR MONEY ON CLOTHES 
WE WERE LIKE LITTLE PEACOCKS 
I'M THE HIPPIEST NUMBER IN TOWN AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY 
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY 
I'M THE SNAPPIEST DRESSER RIGHT DOWN TO MY INCH WIDE TIE 
ALONG CAME THIS GUY CALLED PETE MEADEN 
HE WAS A PUBLICIST AND HE TRANSFORMED THE BAND 
HE CERTAINLY HAD A FINGER ON THE PULSE 
OF THIS EMBRYO OF A FASHION SEED 
PETE MEADEN HAD THIS THEORY THAT THE MODS 
WERE LIKE THE NEW RELIGION THE NEW ARMY THE NEW EVERYTHING 
AND PROJECTED THAT ONTO US AS INDIVIDUALS 
HE SAID GET OUT THERE CUT YOUR HAIR GO OUT CARNABY STREET BUY ALL THE CLEVER GEAR 
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE'RE A MOD BAND 
PETE ALSO SAID YOU'VE GOT TO CHANGE THE NAME THE WHO 
ONLY IN THAT SENSE HE WAS RIGHT IN GETTING US TO BE MODS 
BUT HE WAS WRONG IN CHANGING THE NAME THE WHO TO THE HIGH NUMBERS 
WE KEPT SEEING THESE POSTERS FOR THE HIGH NUMBERS THE WHO IN BRACKETS 
THEY USED TO PLAY IN WEST HAMPSTEAD THE RAILWAY CLUB 
AND IT WAS A TINY LITTLE SHABBY HALL 
THE WHO CAME UP AS THE HIGH NUMBERS WE DIDN'T KNOW WHO THEY WERE WE JUST WENT UP THERE 
AND THE DRUMMER WAS ABSOLUTELY MENTAL 
GATHER ROUND MY FRIENDS HERE 
HELP ME FORGET MY HURTING TEARS 
ABOUT THE ONLY GIRL I EVER LOVED 
THE ONLY ONE BABY 
I GOTTA DANCE JUST TO KEEP FROM CRYING 
GOTTA DANCE JUST TO KEEP FROM CRYING 
WHOA DO THE FLOP DO THE FLOP DO THE TWIST 
EVERYBODY IT GOES LIKE THIS 
YOU GOTTA DANCE GOT ME SWAYING GOT ME ALL RIGHT 
YOU GOTTA DANCE GOT ME SWAYING GOT ME ALL RIGHT 
DO THE BIRD DO THE BIRD 
DO THE FLY DO THE FLY 
COME ON GANG YOU KNOW BY BY BY OH YEAH 
THEY WERE AMAZING IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THE BEATLES EVEN THE STONES IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THAT 
AND THEY WERE PLAYING MUSIC YOU DIDN'T HEAR VERY OFTEN COVERING MOTOWN AND BLUES 
THEY WERE A MOD BAND AND I WAS A MOD 
WELL BABE IT'S ALL YOU KNOW IT'S ALL RIGHT 
WHEN I MET KIT WE DECIDED TO COME UP WITH AN IDEA TO MAKE A FILM 
WE CAME UP WITH A CONCEPT THAT WE WOULD FIND A GROUP 
WE WOULD MANAGE THE GROUP TO SUCCESS 
AND WE WOULD ALL THE TIME FILM IT 
THIS WAS THE IDEA KIT AND I WE WENT UP AND DOWN ENGLAND LOOKING FOR A GROUP 
WE COULDN'T FIND ANYONE TO PUT IN THE FILM BASICALLY UNTIL WE SAW 
THE HIGH NUMBERS 
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT OOH POOH PA DOO 
BABY CALL ME THE MOST 
YEAH OOH POOH PA DOO 
BABY CALL ME THE MOST 
LAMBERT SAID THAT WAS THE BAND HE WAS LOOKING FOR 
AND I WON'T STOP TRYING 
WE MET LAMBERT AND STAMP AND THE FIRST THING THEY WANTED TO DO 
THEY LOVED EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT US EXCEPT THE NAME 
AND WHEN WE TOLD THEM WE USED TO BE CALLED THE WHO THEY WENT GREAT 
THEY WERE VERY INDIVIDUAL THEY DIDN'T REALLY GET ALONG YOU KNOW THAT PERSONALLY 
I'D BEEN IN A GANG IN MY ADOLESCENCE IT WASN'T THAT DIFFERENT 
IT JUST CAME ACROSS NOT ANTISOCIAL BUT THEY WEREN'T THERE TO TRY TO PLEASE PEOPLE 
THEY WERE THERE TO DO WHAT THEY WERE GONNA DO AND IF YOU LIKED IT THAT'S UP TO YOU 
PETE WAS USING VERY HIGH VOLUME AMPLIFIERS 
HE WOULD BECAUSE OF THE POWER IN THE AMPLIFIER CREATE FEEDBACK 
HE DID THIS THING WHERE HE USED TO LIFT THE GUITAR LIKE THIS 
WE HAD A VERY LOW CEILING THERE I USED TO BANG IT TO MAKE IT GO BOING BOING BOING 
AND THE GUITAR NECK WENT THROUGH THE CEILING 
AND WHEN IT BROKE I THOUGHT I MAY AS WELL FINISH IT OFF 
WE JUST STOOD THERE AND WENT WHAT IS GOING ON HERE IT'S GREAT 
I MEAN NOBODY HAD EVER SMASHED ANYTHING ON A STAGE 
I SAW KEITH LOOKING AT ME 
NEXT WEEK I START BANGING MY OTHER GUITAR AND IMMEDIATELY THE DRUMS WERE OVER STICKS THREW 
PETE SAID AFTERWARDS ONCE I KNEW THAT MOONIE WAS WITH ME THEN I WOULD DO IT AGAIN 
THE GUITAR BECAME WHEN IT WAS ELECTRIFIED IN MY CASE 
PEOPLE SAY TO ME IT'S JUST STAGECRAFT INNIT SHOWING OFF SMASHING A GUITAR 
BUT TO ME IT WAS FAR FAR FAR MORE THAN THAT 
AT ART SCHOOL PETE AND BARNSEY HAD ATTENDED LECTURES BY GUSTAV METZGER 
A GERMAN ARTIST WHO DESTROYED HIS CREATIONS 
AS A POLITICAL PROTEST AGAINST NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
GUSTAV METZGER CAME TO MY COLLEGE TO DO LECTURES 
IT WAS CALLED THE DESTRUCTION IN ART SYMPOSIUM 
YOKO ONO DID THAT THING WHERE SHE HAD HER CLOTHES CUT UP 
AND HE SLASHED HIS WAY THROUGH A CANVAS WITH A SAMURAI SWORD 
AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW I'M BREAKING UP GUITARS AT GIGS 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A BIT AIRY FAIRY DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
IT WAS SORT OF WHY BOTHER YOU'RE FUCKING ANGRY YOU SMASH YOUR GUITAR UP IT LOOKS GREAT 
IT DOES SUGGEST THE RAGE THAT WE ALL FEEL 
I REALLY DID ANNOY ME THAT THE VISUAL KIND OF TOOK OVER 
FROM WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON 
I'D EVEN HAVE THE GUYS IN THE BAND GOING WHAT A LOAD OF PRETENTIOUS DRIVEL 
AND I'D GO NO IT'S AUTO DESTRUCTIVE ART 
PETE WAS EVEN IN THOSE DAYS IN A CLASS OF HIS OWN 
IT WAS THIS ACT YOU KNOW SMASHING UP THE INSTRUMENTS 
FEEDBACK PETE'S WINDMILLING ARM 
AND HE DID THIS THING THAT THE KIDS CALLED THE BIRDMAN 
LAMBERT AND STAMP GOT US A GIG AT THE MARQUEE IN THE WEST END OF LONDON 
SIDEWAYS AND THE PROFILE OF HIS NOSE 
FABULOUS ABSOLUTELY CLASSIC YOU COULD NOT IGNORE THAT POSTER IT WAS LIKE WHAT IS THE WHO 
WITHIN A MONTH THE QUEUES WOULD BE ALL THE WAY DOWN WARDOUR STREET 
AND THEY WOULD BE TURNING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AWAY IT WAS INCREDIBLE 
I'VE GOT TO ADMIT THAT I FELT THAT WE WERE SPECIAL 
WHENEVER SHE CALLS MY NAME 
YEAH YEAH YEAH I CAN'T EXPLAIN 
I FEEL 
I FEEL 
I FEEL THIS BURNING PAIN 
IT'S TO DO WITH ATTITUDE 
IT'S LIKE YOU CAN HIT YOUR HAND LIKE THAT 
THAT'S THE TEMPO 
OR YOU CAN HIT IT LIKE THIS 
NOW THERE'S TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT ATTITUDES 
THE TEMPO HASN'T CHANGED AT ALL AND THE WHO ALWAYS DID IT WITH THAT ATTITUDE AND DRIVE 
OH YEAH 
OH YEAH 
WHOO 
OH YEAH 
OH YEAH 
WHOO 
DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO 
YEAH 
HEATWAVE 
BURNING IN MY HEART 
I REMEMBER ONE THING THAT WE WERE VERY MUCH AWARE OF 
WAS THAT WE WERE STILL COPYING OTHER PEOPLE'S SONGS 
BY NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR THE BEATLES WERE REVOLUTIONISING POPULAR MUSIC WITH THEIR SONG WRITING 
THE ROLLING STONES AND THE KINKS JOINED THE BRITISH INVASION OF AMERICA 
BY RECORDING ORIGINAL MATERIAL 
GIRL YOU REALLY GOT ME GOING 
YOU GOT ME SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING 
WE NEEDED A SONGWRITER IN THE GROUP AND PETE TURNED OUT TO BE ONE 
I LISTENED TO A COUPLE OF KINKS SONGS AND JUST PRODUCED THIS RHYTHM 
I GOT A FEELING INSIDE I CAN'T EXPLAIN 
IT'S A CERTAIN KIND I CAN'T EXPLAIN 
I FEEL HOT AND COLD I CAN'T EXPLAIN 
YEAH DOWN IN MY SOUL YEAH I CAN'T EXPLAIN 
UNLIKE THE KINKS WHAT ON THE SURFACE APPEARS TO BE A VERY FRILLY LITTLE POP SONG 
IS A MUCH MUCH BIGGER STATEMENT FROM THE VOCAL 
I'VE GOT A FEELING INSIDE AND I CAN'T EXPLAIN 
YOU COULD SEE THAT TOWNSHEND AS A WRITER HAD HUGE POTENTIAL 
COS HE WASN'T GOING THE NORMAL WAY THAT POP SONGS GO HE WAS GOING INTERNAL 
I CAN'T EXPLAIN I THINK IT'S LOVE 
TRY TO SAY IT TO YOU WHEN I FEEL BLUE 
I CAN'T EXPLAIN 
BACK IN THOSE EARLY DAYS I THOUGHT I'M NOT GOING TO WRITE SONGS FOREVER 
THIS IS BORING YOU KNOW I REALLY THOUGHT CAN'T EXPLAIN WAS QUITE CHILDISH 
PETE'S HOME RECORDED DEMO OF THE SONG WOULD GET THEM SIGNED 
HE WAS NINETEEN 
HE HAD IT ON TAPE WHICH I PLAYED OVER THE PHONE TO SHEL TALMY 
THE DEMO I HEARD WAS ABOUT A MINUTE AND TEN SECONDS LONG 
IT'S PROBABLY SAFE TO SAY IN ABOUT THE FIRST UH THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE SECONDS I SAID YES 
I SAID I WILL GET US A DEAL 
KIT TOLD US THIS RECORDING DEAL 
AND I MEAN I'M A SHEPHERD'S BUSH BOY I WORK THE MARKETS 
WHEN KIT TOLD US OUR PERCENTAGE IT HAD SOMETHING LIKE A COUPLE OF CENTS ON THE END OF IT 
WHEN KIT LAMBERT AND CHRIS STAMP WERE MANAGING THE BAND THEY GOT A VERY BAD DEAL 
I WENT ROUND TO ALL THE RECORD SHOPS GAVE THEM FREE COPIES 
GAVE THEM POSTERS AND I HELPED PUSH IT THAT WAY 
BUT THEN LUCKILY RADIO CAROLINE PLAYED IT 
CAROLINE THE SOUND OF THE NATION 
CAROLINE 
FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT UNTIL THREE A M. 
I GOT A FEELING INSIDE I CAN'T EXPLAIN 
RADIO CAROLINE WAS THE FIRST OF THE PIRATE RADIO STATIONS 
COS RADIO WAS CONTROLLED IN ENGLAND BY THE B. B. C. 
AND SUDDENLY THESE SHIPS OUT OF ENGLAND'S JURISDICTION STARTED TO PUMP THE MUSIC OUT INTO ENGLAND 
AND TOOK OFF LIKE A ROCKET 
THE TRUTH IS WITHOUT PIRATE RADIO THE ENGLISH INVASION AND ALL THAT POP SCENE WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED 
I CAN'T EXPLAIN I THINK IT'S LOVE 
TRY TO SAY IT TO YOU WHEN I FEEL BLUE 
I CAN'T EXPLAIN 
RELEASED JANUARY FIFTEENTH NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE 
I CAN'T EXPLAIN WOULD CLIMB TO NUMBER EIGHT ON THE NEW MUSICAL EXPRESS CHART 
I WAS DRIVING OVER HAMMERSMITH FLYOVER 
AND HEARD CAN'T EXPLAIN ON THE RADIO 
AND THOUGHT WOW YOU KNOW I'VE GOT A COMMISSION I'VE GOT A PATRON 
THIS IS ART 
BRUNSWICK RECORDS SOLD ONE HUNDRED FOUR THOUSAND COPIES OF THE SINGLE 
THE BOYS MADE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EACH 
YEAH I CAN'T EXPLAIN 
SO SAD ABOUT US BY THE WHO 
IT WAS CHAOS COS WE WERE SMASHING UP ALL THIS EQUIPMENT 
AND I HAD NO MONEY 
I USED TO TAKE ALL PETE'S GUITARS IN BETWEEN THE SHOWS 
PUT THEM TOGETHER SO WHILE ONE WAS BEING GLUED 
ANOTHER WOULD BE ALL SET FROM THE DAY BEFORE 
THE MAIN THING WAS TO KEEP THE BAND WORKING 
I CAN GO ANYWAY 
WAY I CHOOSE 
I CAN LIVE ANYHOW 
WIN OR LOSE 
I CAN GO ANYWHERE 
IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS COMMON FOR US TO DO A SHOW AT EIGHT TILL NINE 
TRAVEL ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES AND THEN DO ANOTHER SHOW AT MIDNIGHT TILL ONE O'CLOCK 
WE USED TO TAKE AMPHETAMINES 
ALTHOUGH I DISCOVERED THAT TAKING AMPHETAMINES DIDN'T GO WITH BEING A GOOD SINGER 
THEY'RE PILLED UP LIKE NO TOMORROW 
AND THEIR PLAYING BECAME JUST A NOISE 
TEMPERS WENT OUT THE WINDOW 
VOLUMES WENT OUT THE WINDOW 
AND EVERYTHING WE'D WORKED TO BE GOOD AT 
SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED OUT THE WINDOW DUE TO AMPHETAMINES 
SO IT ALL CAME TO A HEAD AT ONE SHOW 
WHERE I JUST GAVE UP ONSTAGE LEFT THE STAGE 
WENT BACK TO THE DRESSING ROOM 
GOT THE BAG OF AMPHETAMINES OUT OF MOONY'S CASE 
FLUSHED THEM DOWN THE TOILET 
MOON WENT UP LIKE A ROCKET 
AND HIT ME WITH A TAMBOURINE 
I LAYED INTO MOONY AND ENDED UP IN A REAL GOOD PUNCH UP 
THE ROADIES PULLED US APART OF COURSE 
BUT THE DAMAGE HAD BEEN DONE 
BASICALLY I WAS THROWN OUT THE BAND 
AT THAT MOMENT I DIDN'T GIVE A FUCK COS IF THAT WAS GONNA BE THE BAND 
AS THEY HAD BEEN ON THE AMPHETAMINES IT WASN'T WORTH BEING IN ANYWAY 
SO SAD ABOUT US 
HE HAD BEEN THIS SORT OF TOUGH GUY BOSS OF THE GROUP 
ROGER PUTS THIS BAND TOGETHER THEN FINDS THE THREE DWARVES 
THAT HE'D BROUGHT IN TO SUPPORT HIM SUDDENLY LEAVING HIM BEHIND 
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE THAT I REALISED THAT I LOVED SOMETHING ELSE OTHER THAN MYSELF 
AND I THOUGHT IF I'M BEING THROWN OUT FOR BEING LIKE I WAS THEN I'LL HAVE TO CHANGE 
COS THE BAND IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAN ANYTHING 
AFTER ABOUT FOUR WEEKS THEY CAME BACK AND SAID 
LOOK YOU'RE BACK IN THE BAND BUT YOU'RE ON PROBATION 
ONE MORE OUTBURST LIKE THAT AND YOU'RE OUT 
WHERE'S PETE KIT 
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA 
YOU BETTER GO AND FIND HIM 
FOUR WEEKS AFTER THE BLOW UP IN COPENHAGEN 
THE WHO RETURNED TO THE STUDIO TO RECORD PETE'S LATEST CREATION 
YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT SOUND 
MY GENERATION BY THE WHO 
PEOPLE TRY TO PUT US D. DOWN 
TALKING BOUT MY GENERATION 
JUST BECAUSE WE GET AROUND 
TALKING BOUT MY GENERATION 
MY GENERATION WAS THE SONG THAT I FELT AN IMMEDIATE SORT OF THING FOR 
HOPE I DIE BEFORE I GET OLD 
THIS HAD TO BE THE ESSENCE OF THE WHO 
MY GENERATION JUST MY GENERATION BABY 
I REMEMBER THE MY GENERATION SESSION VERY CLEARLY 
THE FACT THAT HE STUTTERED ON IT 
YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
I'M NOT TRYING TO CAUSE A BIG S. SENSATION 
ROGER'S GOT A STORY ABOUT THE STUTTER 
AND SO HAS CHRIS STAMP THEY'RE BOTH WELL OUT OF ORDER 
THE STUTTER CAME FROM JOHN LEE HOOKER 
IT WAS TO DO WITH THE PILLED UP MOD AND THE OLD BLUES STUTTERER SO 
AND WHEN I PUT IT ON THE FIRST DEMO IT WAS PARTLY THERE 
AND CHRIS STAMP SAID WHAT'S THAT AND I SAID I'M STUTTERING 
AND I THINK MAYBE HE DIDN'T REALISE THAT I MEANT TO STUTTER 
I DON'T REMEMBER IT BEING ON THE DEMO 
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MY MEMORY'S NOT THAT GOOD ON IT 
DOES IT REALLY MATTER 
MY GENERATION MY GENERATION BABY 
I MARVELLED AT THAT BASSLINE 
VERY FLASHY VERY EFFECTIVE 
AND COMPLETELY ORIGINAL I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM 
IT WAS FANTASTIC 
AMAZING THE BASS SOLO IN MY GENERATION 
IF YOU COULD WRITE THAT IN WORDS THAT'S WHAT YOU'D HAVE ON YOUR GRAVESTONE 
PEOPLE TRY TO PUT US D. DOWN 
TALKING BOUT MY GENERATION 
JUST BECAUSE WE G. G. GET AROUND 
TALKING BOUT MY GENERATION 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VERY VERY EARLY DAYS HERE 
WE HADN'T REALLY RESPECTED THE DIFFICULTIES THAT ROGER HAD 
IT'S WRONG FOR ME TO SAY THIS BUT YOU KNOW 
KEITH WAS A GENIUS JOHN WAS A GENIUS 
I WAS CERTAINLY ON THE EDGE OF IT 
YOU KNOW ROGER WAS A SINGER 
THAT WAS IT 
THAT I WOULD NEVER LET THEM WHATEVER THEY DID TO ME 
WHATEVER THEY DID I WOULDN'T EVER REACT LIKE THAT AGAIN TO THEM 
AND I BECAME A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GUY AS FAR AS THAT'S CONCERNED 
I STRUGGLED MORE THAN ANYTHING 
TO FIND A VOICE A REAL VOICE FOR THIS BAND 
IT'S MY GENERATION 
I DON'T MIND OTHER GUYS DANCING WITH MY GIRL 
THATS FINE I KNOW THEM ALL PRETTY WELL 
BUT I KNOW SOMETIMES I MUST GET OUT IN THE LIGHT 
BETTER LEAVE HER BEHIND 
WITH THE KIDS THEY'RE ALL RIGHT 
THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT 
OUR AMBITIONS IN THOSE DAYS WERE VERY VERY SIMPLE 
TO BE RICH AND FAMOUS WE MADE NO EXCUSES FOR IT 
WE'D GOT OUT OF HAVING OUR ARSE HANGING OUT OF OUR TROUSERS 
I DON'T MAKE ANY APOLOGIES FOR WANTING TO BE RICH AND FAMOUS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
I WAS BORN WITH A PLASTIC SPOON IN MY MOUTH 
THE NORTH SIDE OF MY TOWN FACED EAST 
AND THE EAST WAS FACING SOUTH 
THE WHO PLAYED SIXTY SHOWS THROUGH THE FIRST NINETY DAYS OF NINETEEN SIXTY SIX 
WE HAVE GOT FOR YOU THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL GROUP IN ENGLAND 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE WHO 
THE WHO THE WHO LES WHO 
THE WHO 
ONE GIRL WAS CALLED JEAN MARIE 
ANOTHER LITTLE GIRL WAS CALLED FELICITY 
IT USED TO FEEL TO ME THAT THE BAND WAS DOOMED YOU KNOW 
IF I'M GOING OFF WITH THIS FUCKING HORRIBLE BAND OF YOBBOES 
YOU KNOW TO GERMANY AND TO SWEDEN 
I HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN COMMON WHATSOEVER NOTHING 
THEY WERE AT EACH OTHER A LOT 
THE WHO WAS BUILT ON COMPETITION 
AND THE COMPETITION WAS HORRENDOUS ON AND OFF THE STAGE 
NO IT GOT GREAT BECAUSE IT BECAME WONDERFULLY ON EDGE BECAUSE OF THAT 
YOU COULD BE WATCHING THE WHO IN SIXTY SIX SIXTY SEVEN PERIOD 
WHEN THEY WERE GIGGING 
AND IN THE MIDDLE OF A SHOW SUDDENLY PETE WOULD GET THE GUITAR 
AND WHACK IT ROUND ROGER'S IT WAS FANTASTIC EVERYONE WATCHING WAS ON EDGE ALL THE TIME 
WANNA PLAY CRICKET ON THE GREEN 
RIDE MY BIKE ACROSS THE STREET 
CUT MYSELF AND SEE MY BLOOD 
WANNA COME HOME ALL COVERED IN MUD 
I'M A BOY I'M A BOY 
BUT MY MA WON'T ADMIT IT 
I'M A BOY I'M A BOY I'M A BOY 
ROGER TALKS NOW VERY ROMANTICALLY ABOUT THOSE DAYS LIKE THEY WERE SOME KIND OF MAGIC 
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF MAGIC WHAT THERE WAS WAS A LOT OF BRUTE FORCE 
I'M A BOY 
NOBODY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING 
THOSE BANDS WERE MANAGED BY KIDS WHO DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT THEY WERE DOING EITHER 
IN MARCH OF SIXTY SIX THE WHO AND THEIR MANAGEMENT BROKE THEIR CONTRACT 
WITH PRODUCER SHEL TALMY AND BEGAN MAKING THEIR OWN RECORDS 
VERY EARLY ON KIT AND I REALISED 
THAT IF WE WEREN'T IN CONTROL OF THE RECORDING 
AND HOW IT WENT AND WHAT HAPPENED IT WOULD JUST BE HOPELESS 
WE WOULD LOSE THIS GIGANTIC PIECE OF WHAT THE DESTINY OF THE GROUP WAS 
SO WE HAD TO GET OUT OF THAT CONTRACT 
NOW IT'S A LEGAL MATTER BABY 
LAMBERT AND STAMP STARTED THEIR OWN COMPANY TRACK RECORDS 
I WAS LIKE THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER 
KIT WAS THE OVERALL SORT OF MUSICAL DIRECTOR 
DAY TO DAY RIGHT IN THE STUDIO 
PICTURES OF LILY BY THE WHO 
I USED TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING 
I USED TO FEEL SO BAD 
KIT LAMBERT HAD GREAT IDEAS BUT WASN'T TECHNICALLY VERY GOOD 
KIT WAS THE ULTIMATE BARNUM AND BAYLEAF CONMAN IN A LOT OF WAYS 
HE WOULD BLUSTER HIS WAY THROUGH THINGS YOU KNOW 
HE HAD A LOT OF FRONT AND COURAGE IN THAT WAY 
HE WAS A FUCKING PAIN IN THE ARSE 
YOU KNOW IN THE STUDIO 
BUT HE MADE IT FUN 
PICTURES OF LILY 
YOU KNOW I CAN DO IT ONCE I GET USED TO SORT OF JUST DO IT WITH CONFIDENCE JUST HIT IT 
YOU KNOW AND KEITH WHEN YOU HIT THE VERY HIGH NOTE 
BACK OFF A BIT YOU'RE REALLY PIERCING BECAUSE OF THE HEIGHT OF IT 
YOU KEEP JUMPING ON JOHN'S NOTES 
JOHN'S USUALLY LOUDER THAN EVERYONE ELSE ANYWAY 
IF ANYONE NEEDS BACKING UP IT'S ME 
YOU'LL CUT THROUGH EVERYTHING ANYWAY ON THAT NOTE 
OH 
OH 
KIT LAMBERT'S FATHER CONSTANT LAMBERT CREATED THE ROYAL BALLET CREATED THE ROYAL BALLET 
KIT GOT INTO FILM BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE ANYTHING TO DO WITH MUSIC 
AND SUDDENLY LIFE RIPS HIM BACK IN THE MIDDLE OF MUSIC ONLY A DIFFERENT TYPE 
AND I ASK YOU 
HEY MISTER HAVE YOU EVER SEEN 
PICTURES OF LILY 
I WOULD SAY TO KIT WHY NOT WRITE A FUCKING OPERA I DON'T WANT TO WRITE ROCK SONGS ALL THE TIME 
AND HE CONSTANTLY ENCOURAGED ME ON THE BASIS OF HIS BACKGROUND 
HER MAN'S BEEN GONE 
FOR NEARLY A YEAR 
HE WAS DUE HOME YESTERDAY 
BUT HE AIN'T HERE 
IT WAS CALLED THE MINI OPERA A QUICK ONE WHILE HE'S AWAY 
WHICH IS AN ENGLISH WAY OF SAYING YOU HAVE A QUICK FUCK WHILE THE HUSBAND'S AWAY THAT WAS THE STORY 
DOWN YOUR STREET YOUR CRYING IS A WELL KNOWN SOUND 
IT WAS A BIG OPERATIC PIECE TOLD IN THESE SIX OR SEVEN ONE OR TWO MINUTE PIECES OF SONG 
WE HAVE A REMEDY YOU'LL APPRECIATE 
NO NEED TO BE SO SAD HE'S ONLY LATE 
KIT KEPT SAYING MY FATHER CONSTANT LAMBERT WOULD HAVE LOVED THE WHO SO HE WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE 
PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP THAT KIT AND PETE HAD WAS EACH OTHER 
YOU ARE FORGIVEN YOU ARE FORGIVEN 
DURING THE RECORDING SESSION FOR A QUICK ONE 
LAMBERT INTRODUCED THE BAND TO ONE OF THE FIRST ARTISTS SIGNED BY THE NEW TRACK RECORDS 
HE CAME TO THE STUDIO BEFORE HE BECAME THE LEGENDARY JIMI HENDRIX HE WAS JUST A GUITARIST IN A SOUL BAND 
YOU ARE FORGIVE EN 
RUN RUN RUN 
RUN RUN RUN 
WE'D ALWAYS BEEN LOOKING AT THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE THAT WAS LIKE THE HOME OF THE MUSIC WE LOVED 
THEY TOURED AND TOURED AND TOURED 
THE WHO WERE A BRAND THAT REPRESENTED BRITISHNESS AND EVERYTHING THAT LONDON STOOD FOR 
THEY WORE IT ON THEIR BACKS FOR THEIR BRITISH INVASION 
RUN RUN RUN 
RUN RUN RUN 
WE COULDN'T JUST COME OVER AND MAKE A COUPLE OF HIT TUNES 
IF THEY TOOD THE WHO THEY HAD TO TAKE THE WHOLE PACKAGE 
IN MARCH OF NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN 
THEY PLAYED A NINE DAY SHOWCASE IN NEW YORK CITY 
THREE MONTHS LATER THEY WENT WITH THEIR NEW LABEL MATE TO MONTEREY CALIFORNIA 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAN FRANCISCO 
MONTEREY WAS A BIG ONE FOR US 
BEFORE WE EVEN GOT TO MONTEREY IT WAS BUILT UP IN MY IMAGINATION 
AS AN ENORMOUS EVENT 
THE WORST THING ABOUT MONTEREY IS WE FOUND OUT FROM ONE OF OUR EX ROADIES THAT HENDRIX WAS GONNA STEAL OUR ACT 
JIMI WAS OUT OF HIS BRAIN ON ACID AND WOULDN'T DISCUSS THE WHO WOULD GO ON FIRST 
IT WASN'T THAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO FOLLOW HIM WE JUST WANTED TO GET OUR ACT DONE FIRST 
WE WERE KIND OF CHOKED UP BECAUSE WE WERE IN DEBT BECAUSE WE SMASHED OUR GUITARS 
AND THEN SUDDENLY SOMEONE WAS GOING TO COME ALONG AND STEAL IT IN FRONT OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE 
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO AN ACT WHO'VE BEEN PASSED BY IN AMERICA 
BUT THEY WON'T BE AFTER THIS THIS IS THE WHO 
PEOPLE TRY TO PUT US D. D. DOWN 
TALKING ABOUT MY GENERATION 
THEY PLAYED WITH A SENSE OF ABANDON 
IN A WAY THAT HADN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE ABSOLUTE ABANDON 
HOPE I DIE BEFORE I GET OLD 
THERE WAS A SORT OF EXORCISM THE PERFORMANCE JUST WENT OFF 
INTO A KIND OF EMOTIONAL MELTDOWN WHICH I DON'T THINK ANYONE HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE 
THE VISUAL WAS THE RITUALISTIC SLAUGHTER OF A GUITAR 
THE SOUND OF THAT SLAUGHTER WAS FUCKING BRILLIANT 
THE BEST JAZZ IT WAS THE BEST ROCK AND ROLL IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE NO ONE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE 
AND I STILL LOVE IT TO THIS DAY 
WE MADE THE HOUSE STAND UP AND ROAR AND SCREAM AND SHOUT THEY'D HEARD ABOUT IT BUT NEVER SEEN IT HAPPEN 
AND THEN HENDRIX CAME ON PLAYED FAIRLY WELL SET HIS GUITAR ALIGHT AND DID IT ALL AGAIN 
THE CROWD GOT UP WITH THE SAME KIND OF ROAR BUT SLIGHTLY MYSTIFIED WHAT'S GOING ON HERE 
AFTER MONTEREY I BECAME VERY DISTURBED ABOUT ACID 
COMING BACK FROM MONTEREY ON THE PLANE HE HAD A REALLY BAD TRIP 
AND VOWED HE WOULDN'T TAKE ANY MORE PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS AFTER THAT 
I JUST STARTED TO GET REALLY SICKENED BY L. S. D. AND ACID AND BY PSYCHEDELIA 
BUT I'D ALSO BEEN INSPIRED BY IT NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT 
SO I WAS CONFUSED BY IT 
WITHIN ABOUT TWO MONTHS OF THAT HE WAS INTO MEHER BABA 
I FOUND HIM THROUGH A MAN CALLED MIKE MCINNERNEY 
PETE LIKE EVERY ROCK AND ROLL STAR WAS NOT HAVING A GOOD TIME SOMETIMES 
HE GAVE ME A BOOD CALLED THE GOD MAN ABOUT THIS GUY CALLED MEHER BABA 
HE WAS A PERSIAN BORN IN INDIA WHO TOOK A VOW OF SILENCE AND KEPT IT FOR MOST OF HIS LIFE 
TRUE BELIEVERS CALLED HIM AN AVATAR GOD ON EARTH 
THE VERY SIMPLE THING THAT BABA ASKED YOU TO DO WAS TO LOVE HIM 
THERE'S A DIFFICULTY THERE WHEN YOU'RE IN ROCK AND ROLL 
PETE'S A PERFORMER AND HAVING TO DO ALL THE STUFF AND YET HE CHOOSES TO TRY AND MAKE A SPIRITUAL JOURNEY 
THE YEAR PETE WROTE I CAN'T EXPLAIN MEHER BABA WARNED AGAINST SEARCHING FOR GOD IN A PILL 
TO THE SINCERE SEEKER AFTER TRUTH EXPERIMENTATION WITH DRUGS MAY WELL OPEN DOORS 
BUT CONTINUED USE WILL LEAD TO MADNESS DEATH AND INSANITY 
AND YOU KNOW FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN THERE ARE VERY VERY VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS 
WE WERE BOOKED ON A TOUR WITH HERMAN'S HERMITS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT 
HERMAN'S HERMITS AUDIENCE WAS THIRTEEN YEAR OLD MIDDLE CLASS GIRLS 
THEY WERE INTRODUCED TO THEIR FIRST PIECE OF DANGER 
I WANT THE MAGIC BUS 
THEY JUST RAN THEY RAN TO THE BACK OF THE HALL UNTIL HERMAN CAME ON 
BUS MAGIC BUS 
IN GEORGIA MOON DISCOVERED FIREWORK STANDS 
AND IN MICHIGAN HE CELEBRATED HIS TWENTY FIRST BIRTHDAY 
I DO REMEMBER A CAR DID END UP IN THE SWIMMING POOL 
THERE WAS A LOT OF CARNAGE 
HOW MUCH OF THAT IS TRUE I DON'T KNOW I WANT IT ALL TO BE TRUE 
YOU WANT TO THINK HE DROVE A ROLLS ROYCE INTO A SWIMMING POOL 
THE TRUTH IS SEVERAL CARS WERE DAMAGED AS WELL AS SEVERAL ROOMS IN THE HOTEL 
MOON CHIPPED A TOOTH RUNNING FROM THE LAW AND THE WHO WAS BANNED FROM HOLIDAY INNS FOR LIFE 
AND OVER HERE THE GUY WHO PLAYS THE SLOPPY DRUMS WHAT'S YOUR NAME KEITH 
MY FRIEND CALL ME KEITH YOU CAN CALL ME JOHN 
WHAT'S YOUR NEXT SONG M. MY GENERATION 
YOUR GENERATION I CAN REALLY IDENTIFY WITH THAT 
BECAUSE I IDENTIFY WITH THESE GUYS I DIG 'EM TOOT 
YOU GOT SLOPPY STAGEHANDS ROUND HERE 
ON THE LAST GIG OF THE TRIP THEY SMASHED UP THEIR GEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME ON AMERICAN TELEVISION 
KEITH BRIBED THAT SLOPPY STAGEHAND TO OVERSTUFF HIS DRUM WITH A DANGEROUS AMOUNT OF EXPLOSIVES 
MOON MANAGED TO FULFIL THE OUTRAGEOUS PART OF A BAND AND WE LET HIM GET ON WITH IT 
OW AGH 
HAPPY JACK WASN'T 
OBVIOUSLY PETE WANTED A BIGGER CHALLENGE 
THAN THE THREE MINUTE SINGLE 
HE WANTED TO WRITE SOMETHING MUCH MORE COMPLEX DETAILED AND LAYERED 
IN FOUR YEARS THE WHO HAD RELEASED EIGHT SINGLES IN THE U. K. ALL OF THEM TOP TEN HITS 
SINGLES DROVE THE MARKET 
IF THE SINGLE HAPPENED YOU WENT TO AN ALBUM 
AS MUCH AS WE LOVED THE THREE MINUTE SINGLE THE VALUE WAS MORE THAN JUST A THREE MINUTE SINGLE 
IT COULD ADD UP TO A LOT MORE 
IN DECEMBER NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN THE WHO PRODUCED A PIECE OF POP ART 
THE ONLY TIME THAT I EVEN APPROACHED MY ART SCHOOL TRAINING WAS IN WHO SELL OUT 
DOING COMMERCIALS AND WRITING SONGS ABOUT PRODUCTS 
COCA COLA THINGS GO BETTER WITH COKE 
IT'S A VERY UNUSUAL CONCEPT 
WE WANT THE ALBUM TO HAVE THE ATMOSPHERE OF A PIRATE RADIO STATION 
SO WE'VE DONE A COMMERCIAL FOR JAGUAR CARS HEINZ BAKED BEANS 
AND EACH ONE FUNNILY ENOUGH HAS OPENED UP A FAIRLY UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY MUSICALLY 
WHICH WE WOULDN'T HAVE GOT FROM OUR NORMAL NUMBERS 
KEITH'S PLAYING ONE WE DID YESTERDAY VERY BOLD OF YOU 
PETE REALISED HE WAS ONTO SOMETHING 
WE KNEW THE ALBUM WAS GONNA BE THE NEW ART FORM 
ROCK MUSIC CHANGED THE BUSINESS IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT 
THAT YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME PEOPLE BOUGHT MORE ALBUMS THAN SINGLES 
I USED TO SAY THE SIXTIES WAS LIKE A RENAISSANCE ALMOST BUT THE ONE ART FORM OR MEANS OF COMMUNCIATION 
THAT WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ALL THE OTHERS WAS POPULAR MUSIC 
MORE MUSIC MORE MUSIC MORE MUSIC 
THE WHO TOURED THE U. K. EUROPE AUSTRALIA AND COAST TO COAST ACROSS NORTH AMERICA TWICE 
I KNOW YOU'VE DECEIVED ME NOW HERE'S A SURPRISE 
I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE COS THERE'S MAGIC IN MY EYES 
I CAN SEE FOR MILES AND MILES 
AND MILES AND MILES AND MILES 
WE PUT OUT I CAN SEE FOR MILES CLEARLY IT WASN'T GOING TO CHANGE THE WORLD 
AND IT WAS THE BEST POSSIBLE THING I COULD EVER WRITE 
SO I JUST THOUGHT WHAT DO WE DO NOW WE'RE FUCKED 
YOU'RE GONNA CHOKE ON IT TOO YOU'RE GONNA LOSE THAT SMILE 
BECAUSE ALL THE WHILE 
I CAN SEE FOR MILES AND MILES 
I CAN SEE FOR MILES AND MILES 
I WENT AWAY AND I THOUGHT I HAVE TO SAVE THIS BAND I HAVE TO DO IT 
KIT CAN'T DO IT KEITH CAN'T DO IT ROGER CAN'T DO IT I HAVE TO DO IT 
OVERTURE 
HE COMES UP WITH THIS IDEA OF THIS DEAF DUMB AND BLIND BOY 
THE ONLY WAY HE CONNECTS WITH LIFE 
IS THE HE FEELS THE VIBES RIGHT 
THE VIBES ARE MUSIC 
THAT WAS IT 
NOW THAT WAS LIKE THE SCREENPLAY WRITTEN ON THE BACK OF A CIGARETTE PACKET 
THAT IS WHAT PETE'S IDEA WAS 
IT IS A BIT LIKE AN OPERA BUT IN ACTUAL FACT IT'S A ROCK OPERA 
IT'S MODERN MUSIC AS SUCH 
IT'S THE STORY OF TOMMY THE DEAF DUMB AND BLIND BOY 
AND HIS HIS JOURNEY THROUGH TO THE EXTREME HIGH LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS 
DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE'S DEAF DUMB AND BLIND 
I'M FREE 
I'M FREE 
I'M FREE 
FREEDOM 
TASTES OF REALITY 
IT'S ALL PART OF REINCARNATION AND LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS' 
AND STUFF LIKE THIS MEHER BABA STUFF 
BABA MIGHT HAVE PROVIDED THE SPIRITUAL GLUE WHICH MADE SENSE OF 
THE TRAVAILS HE WAS GOING THROUGH AND THE SYMBOLISM IF YOU LIKE 
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE WOUND OF ALL THE SORT OF WORKING CLASS WAR KIDS 
RIGHT IT'S THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE A VOICE YOU KNOW WE COULDN'T SEE 
WE ALL HAD EXACTLY THE SAME EXPERIENCE 
YOU KNOW WHEN HE WENT TO GRANDAD AND YOU SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK MADE THE FUCKING GERMANS DO THAT 
HE WENT I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TALK ABOUT IT FUCK OFF 
YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT YOU DIDN'T SEE IT 
YOU WON'T SAY NOTHING TO NO ONE 
NEVER IN YOUR LIFE YOU NEVER HEARD IT 
OH HOW ABSURD IT ALL SEEMS WITHOUT ANY PROOF 
ALL THESE FUCKING LIES WE GREW UP WITH 
TOMMY WAS SO MUCH ROOTED IN MY CHILDHOOD STORY 
RECORDING BEGAN IN THE FALL OF SIXTY EIGHT AND LASTED SIX MONTHS 
PETE AT THAT TIME WAS WRITING A SONG A WEEK AND LITERALLY 
OR EVEN A SONG THE SAME EVENING AS WE HAD BEEN IN THE STUDIO IN THE AFTERNOON 
AND HE WOULD COME IN THE NEXT DAY AND SAY HERE'S THE NEXT ONE 
FIDDLE ABOUT 
THAT WAS WHEN THE IDEAS FROM THE OTHER GUYS IN THE BAND STARTED TO COME IN 
I'M YOUR WICKED UNCLE ERNIE 
I'M GLAD YOU WON'T SEE OR HEAR ME AS I FIDDLE ABOUT 
FIDDLE ABOUT FIDDLE ABOUT 
JOHN CAME UP WITH TWO REALLY VERY VERY POWERFUL SONGS ABOUT ABUSE AND BULLYING 
THAT I COULDN'T WRITE MYSELF BECAUSE OF MY OWN CHILDHOOD TENDERNESS ON THE SUBJECT 
DOWN WITH THE BEDCLOTHES UP WITH THE NIGHTSHIRT 
FIDDLE ABOUT FIDDLE ABOUT FIDDLE ABOUT 
HIS INPUT SHOULDN'T BE UNDERESTIMATED 
I MEAN THE ANTAGONISTS LIKE UNCLE ERNIE INITIALLY IS 
AND COUSIN KEVIN ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE HERO 
IT GAVE THE WHOLE THING A BALANCE 
GOOD MORNING CAMPERS I AM UNCLE ERNIE AND I WELCOME YOU ALL TO TOMMY'S HOLIDAY CAMP 
KEITH MOON CAME UP WITH THE IDEA THAT THE TEMPLE 
THE BIZARRE CHURCH THAT I CREATED SHOULD ACTUALLY BE A BRITISH HOLIDAY CAMP 
HOLIDAY'S FOREVER HA HA 
IN THAT MOMENT ALL OF THE ELEMENTS CAME TOGETHER 
SMASH THE MIRROR 
AND INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT THE TROUBLE THAT WE HAD CREATED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PROJECT ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO WITH IT 
YOU DON'T ANSWER MY CALL WITH EVEN A NOD OR A WINK 
BUT YOU GAZE AT YOUR OWN REFLECTION ALL RIGHT 
YOU DON'T SEEM TO SEE ME BUT I THINK YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF 
HOW CAN THE MIRROR AFFECT YOU 
CAN YOU EXPLAIN IN ANY KIND OF WAY WHAT SATISFACTION YOU GET FROM IT 
YEAH SEXUAL 
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED BALLS 
AND TO SEE BIG SHINY SILVER BALLS 
RUNNING AROUND A PLAYGROUND LIKE THIS 
I CAN GET A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SATISFACTION BUILDING UP A SCORE 
THAT'S GOING TO KNOCK EVERYBODY ELSE INTO OBLIVION 
WHICH YOU KNOW I DO OFTEN 
PINBALL WIZARD 
THEY CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA OF INTRODUCING PINBALL INTO THIS BIZARRE STRANGE STORY 
EVER SINCE I WAS A YOUNG BOY 
I'VE PLAYED THE SILVER BALL 
FROM SOHO DOWN TO BRIGHTON 
I MUST HAVE PLAYED THEM ALL 
I AIN'T SEEN NOTHING LIKE HIM 
IN ANY AMUSEMENT HALL 
THAT DEAF DUMB AND BLIND KID 
SURE PLAYS A MEAN PINBALL 
PETE THOUGHT IT WAS RUBBISH HE SAID I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER I SHOULD FINISH IT 
AND HE PLAYED IT AND EVERYONE WENT QUIET UNTIL SOMEBODY SAID 
THAT'S A NUMBER ONE HE SAID OH HE COULDN'T SEE THAT IT WAS GOOD 
HE'S A PINBALL WIZARD THERE HAS TO BE A TWIST 
A PINBALL WIZARD'S GOT SUCH A SUPPLE WRIST 
ROGER SUDDENLY DECIDED THAT HE WOULD BE TOMMY AND I WAS SUPPOSED TO SING TOMMY 
HE SAID CAN I BE TOMMY 
AND I REMEMBER THINKING YEAH 
SEE ME 
FEEL ME 
TOUCH ME 
HEAL ME 
IT WAS ONLY RARELY THOUGH WHEN WE GOT ON STAGE WITH TOMMY AS A COMPLETE PIECE OF MUSIC 
THAT I REALLY FOUND MY FEET AND FOUND THE WHO VOICE 
TOUCH ME 
HEAL ME 
ROGER SUDDENLY BECAME THIS DIFFERENT KIND OF SINGER 
FEEL ME 
HE NEVER HAD THAT QUALITY THAT HE NOW HAS WHICH IS OF GOING UP TO THE AUDIENCE AND ENGAGING WITH THEM 
AND OPENING UP HIS BODY TO THEM THAT KIND OF NAKEDNESS 
INSTEAD OF BEING A REALLY TIGHT LITTLE VICIOUS DON'T GET IN MY WAY KIND OF THING 
LISTENING TO YOU 
I GET THE MUSIC 
GAZING AT YOU 
I GET THE HEAT 
FOLLOWING YOU 
I CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN 
I GET EXCITEMENT AT YOUR FEET 
IT WAS A ROLE HE ACTUALLY LIVED EACH SONG ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
GOT A FEELING TWENTY ONE IS GONNA BE A GOOD YEAR 
SPECIALLY IF YOU AND ME SEE IT IN TOGETHER 
SO YOU THINK TWENTY ONE IS GONNA BE A GOOD YEAR 
ROCK AND ROLL WAS STILL BEING SEEN ON A VERY BAD LEVEL 
THE SOUND SYSTEMS WEREN'T GOOD YOU COULDN'T HEAR IT PROPERLY 
SO WE THOUGHT LET'S USE OPERA HOUSES 
GOT NO REASON TO BE OVER OPTIMISTIC 
THE GROUP PLAYED TOMMY TRULY AS AN OPERA AND IT WAS FANTASTIC 
BECAUSE YOU HAD THESE ANCIENT BEAUTIFUL ACOUSTICAL PLACES 
AND THIS AUDIENCE HEARING THEIR MUSIC PLAYED THIS WAY FOR THE FIRST TIME 
AFTER EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF TOURING 
THE WHO PLAYED ONE FINAL OPERA HOUSE IN NEW YORK CITY THE METROPOLITAN 
TOMMY CAN YOU HEAR ME 
THEY REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO PUT ROCK AND ROLL IN THE METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE RIGHT 
THE WORST SNOBS TURNED OUT TO BE AMERICANS 
WE GOT IN AND WHEN WE GOT IN DECCA AND UNIVERSAL RE RELEASED TOMMY 
IT JUST SOLD AGAIN LIKE FIVE TIMES WHAT IT HAD SOLD THE FIRST TIME 
IT BECAME LIKE ONE OF THOSE HUGE ALBUMS 
THAT WAS THE PRINTING MONEY ERA 
CAN YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME 
HOW CAN HE BE SAVED 
TOMMY WAS HUGE AND DID TAKE THE BAND ALONG ON ITS COAT TAILS 
TOMMY IN ITS OWN WAY BECAME AS BIG AS THE WHO 
WAKING UP ON CHRISTMAS MORNING HOURS BEFORE THE WINTER SUN'S IGNITED 
THEY BELIEVE IN DREAMS AND ALL THEY MEAN 
INCLUDING HEAVEN'S GENEROSITY 
PEEPING ROUND THE DOOR TO SEE WHAT PARCELS ARE FOR FREE 
CURIOUSITY 
THEY WERE DEVELOPING THIS HIGH POWERED SOUND FOR LIVE GIGS 
AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE THAT YOU COULD GET THAT FANTASTIC FULL RICH ROCK SOUND 
OUT OF JUST A GUITAR A BASS GUITAR AND A DRUM 
GUITAR SOLO 
LISTENING TO YOU I GET THE MUSIC 
GAZING AT YOU I GET THE HEAT 
FOLLOWING YOU I CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN 
I GET EXCITEMENT AT YOUR FEET 
COME ON 
I STARTED TO FEEL ACCEPTED AGAIN IN THE BAND DURING TOMMY 
ROGER BECAME TOMMY BECAME THIS FIGURE AND THEN IT EQUALISED 
THEN WE WERE UNBELIEVABLY POTENT 
BECAUSE WE WERE BALANCED 
IT WAS A MARRIAGE BUT IT WAS A GOOD MARRIAGE 
THOSE WERE GLORIOUS YEARS 
RIGHT BEHIND YOU I SEE THE MILLIONS 
ON YOU I SEE THE GLORY 
FROM YOU I GET OPINIONS 
FROM YOU I GET THE STORY 
BEHIND BLUE EYES 
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE 
TO BE THE BAD MAN 
TO BE THE SAD MAN 
BEHIND BLUE EYES 
I THINK THAT PETE HAS ALWAYS FELT THE PRESSURE OF BEING THE GUY WHO CAME UP WITH THE IDEAS 
IT WAS SUCH A SPECIAL GIFT THAT HE HAD 
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE 
TO BE HATED 
TO BE FATED 
TO TELLING ONLY LIES 
WE WENT THROUGH TERRIBLE PERIODS WHERE I WOULD WANT TO BE GETTING CLOSER TO HIM 
BUT I HAD TO PUSH MYSELF AWAY BECAUSE HE WAS IN A CREATIVE THING 
AND YOU KIND OF FELT IF THAT YOU LEFT HIM ALONE IT WOULD BE BETTER 
BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR PETE INCREDIBLY LONELY 
HE MUST HAVE FELT SOMETIMES THAT WE DIDN'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT HIM 
I HAVE HOURS ONLY LONELY 
MY LOVE IS VENGEANCE 
THAT'S NEVER FREE 
IT TOOK A TERRIBLE TOLL ON HIM AFTER TOMMY THEY SAID NOW WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NEXT 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE PETE CONCEIVED THE FIRST INTERACTIVE ROCK SHOW 
HE IMAGINED FANS CONNECTED TO THE BAND THE MUSIC THE ART 
THE FUTURISTIC PERFORMANCE WAS TO BE FILMED FOR A MOVIE AND CALLED LIFEHOUSE 
THE TROUBLE IS WITH LIFEHOUSE 
NO ONE I HAVE EVER MET APART FROM PETE EVER UNDERSTOOD IT 
AT THE TIME PEOPLE JUST THOUGHT I WAS NUTS 
INCLUDING HIS MENTOR 
BEHIND MY BACK KIT WAS TELLING EVERYBODY I WAS INSANE 
AND THERE WHAT WE WERE REALLY DOING WAS MAKING A MOVIE OF TOMMY 
AND HE WAS DIRECTING IT 
PETE SAID I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE KNOWN JUST FOR TOMMY IT'S BIGGER THAN THE BAND 
THAT WAS THE POINT WHERE KIT JUST EXPLODED THE RELATIONSHIP 
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE 
TO BE THE BAD MAN 
TO BE THE SAD MAN 
BEHIND BLUE EYES 
IN THE SPRING OF SEVENTY ONE LIFEHOUSE WAS ABANDONED 
THE SONGS FOR LIFEHOUSE BECAME THE BASIS OF THE WHO'S MOST SUCCESSFUL ALBUM WHO'S NEXT 
THE OPENING TRACK WAS AN ANTHEM NAMED IN PART FOR PETE'S SPIRITUAL GUIDE MEHER BABA 
THE NERVE OF HAVING SOMETHING OPEN WITH THAT HUGE LONG SYNTHESISER INTRO YOU KNOW 
WHICH EVERYONE SAID YOU CAN'T HAVE AN INTRO LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE RADIO WON'T PLAY IT YOU KNOW 
HE CLAIMS PETE SAYS THOSE RIFFS ARE 
HE PUT MEHER BABA'S BIRTH INTO THE COMPUTER AND THIS IS WHAT CAME OUT 
OH YEAH YEAH I KNOW YOU PETE YOU'RE A RIOT YOU KNOW 
LIKE HELL 
BABA O'RILEY 
OUT HERE IN THE FIELDS 
I FIGHT FOR MY MEALS 
ONE OF THE FIRST MESSAGES THAT I RECEIVED DIRECTLY FROM MEHER BABA WAS THAT HE RECOGNISED ME 
THAT I WAS ONE OF HIS AS IT WERE AND HE DIED TWO YEARS LATER SO I NEVER MET HIM 
DON'T CRY 
DON'T RAISE YOUR EYE 
IT'S ONLY TEENAGE WASTELAND 
SALLY TAKE MY HAND 
WE'LL TRAVEL SOUTH ACROSS LAND 
PUT OUT THE FIRE AND DON'T LOOK PAST MY SHOULDER 
FOLLOWING THE TOUR FOR WHO'S NEXT PETE WENT TO INDIA TO VISIT THE TOMB OF HIS SPIRITUAL GUIDE 
BELOVED BABA SENDS HIS LOVE TO YOU 
HE IS ALWAYS WITH YOU IN YOU AND NEAR YOU 
AND HE SAYS BE HAPPY AND NOT TO WORRY 
IN A SENSE I WAS ENGAGED IN SOME SORT OF SABOTAGE 
I WAS INSIDE THIS VERY VERY MACHO GROUP THAT SMASHED ITS GUITARS 
AND HAD A REPUTATION FOR BEING QUITE REBELLIOUS 
TRYING TO SPREAD THIS MESSAGE OF LOVE AND PEACE 
THE REAL ME 
I WENT BACK TO THE DOCTOR 
TO GET ANOTHER SHRINK 
I SIT AND TELL HIM ABOUT MY WEEKEND 
BUT HE NEVER BETRAYS WHAT HE THINKS 
CAN YOU SEE THE REAL ME 
DOCTOR DOCTOR 
CAN YOU SEE THE REAL ME 
DOCTOR WHOA DOCTOR 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE PETE CRAFTED A SECOND ROCK OPERA 
QUADROPHENIA WAS SET AGAINST THE RUMBLE OF THE MODS AND ROCKERS 
SHE SAID I KNOW HOW IT FEELS SON 
COS IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY 
I WANTED KIT TO BE A PART OF QUADROPHENIA EVEN THOUGH IT WAS DONE AND DUSTED 
CHRIS SAID HE WAS IN NEW YORK AND HE'D BECOME A HEROIN ADDICT 
AFTER TOMMY THE DRUGS CHANGED 
WE LOST A BIT OF OUR VISION 
THE DYNAMIC OF WEALTH INTRODUCED INTO THIS FAMILY WAS WHAT CHANGED IT 
KIT AND CHRIS WERE FIGHTING ON A DAILY BASIS 
THEY BEGAN TO FALL APART AS PARTNERS AND THEY BEGAN TO FALL APART AS PEOPLE 
IT WAS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT KIT WAS NOW INTO QUITE HEAVY SUBSTANCES AND MONEY WAS GOING MISSING 
IT WASN'T A MATTER OF THEY WERE TRYING TO SCREW US THEY WERE JUST COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL 
WE BECAME THE PROBLEM 
SO IF WE WERE TO GO THE PROBLEM WOULD RESOLVE ITSELF 
NOW I'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT 
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH WE MAY HAVE BEEN FUCKED UP 
WE COULD STILL UTTER ONE DECENT IDEA ONCE A WEEK 
FROM OUR STUPOR YOU KNOW 
SO I DON'T KNOW IT ENDED 
THE BAND TURNED TO BILL CURBISHLEY TO TAKE OVER MANAGEMENT 
I LOOKED AT THE PAST CONTRACTS 
AND WHAT THEY WERE ACHIEVING AS LIVE PERFORMERS 
AND I FELT THAT COULD BE DRAMATICALLY CHANGED 
BELL BOY I GOTTA GET RUNNING NOW 
BELL BOY 
HAVING SET THEIR AFFAIRS IN ORDER HE URGED THEM TO TOUR QUADROPHENIA 
CARRY THE BLOODY BAGGAGE OUT 
BELL BOY ALWAYS RUNNING AT SOMEONE'S HEEL 
BUT PETE'S NEW OPERA WAS MUCH MORE DEMANDING LIVE THAN TOMMY HAD BEEN 
WHAT HAPPENED ON QUADROPHENIA WAS THAT I HAD ABSOLUTE CONTROL 
YOU KNOW EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN IT WAS LIKE MY PUPPET 
AND I THINK BY THE VERY VERY END OF IT ROGER JUST GOT SICK OF IT 
ROGER AND PETE HAD A FIGHT IN REHEARSALS 
HE JUST GOT REALLY ANGRY WITH ME 
TAKES HIS GUITAR HITS ME OVER THE SHOULDER WITH IT SO THE ROAD CREW THEY JUMP ON ME 
I WAS HOLDING PETE BACK AND THE ROADIES WERE HOLDING ROGER BACK 
AND I HADN'T DONE ANYTHING 
PETE TURNED ROUND AND SAID YEAH LET ME GO LET ME GO I SAID FINE LET HIM GO 
AND HE JUST CAME AT ME HE WAS SO DRUNK 
AND HE WALKED UP TO ROGER 
I JUST MANAGED TO CATCH HIM WITH A VERY LUCKY PUNCH WHACK 
COMPLETELY KNOCKED HIM SPARKO 
HIS FEET LEFT THE GROUND AND HE HIT HIS HEAD ON THE STAGE 
AND HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS AND I THOUGHT FUCK 
WE WERE ALL EXHAUSTED AND IT'S A MAGNIFICENT PIECE OF WORK 
ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT IT'S OUR TOWERING TRIUMPH QUADROPHENIA 
SO IN A SENSE YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT OF BLOOD SPILT ON THE WAY IS NOTHING 
AS BOYS THEY PLAYED DANCE HALLS AND PUBS 
HERE THEY ARE THE WHO 
LESS THAN A DECADE LATER THEY WERE HEADLINING STADIUMS 
AS THE WHO DEVELOPED SO HAD THE BUSINESS 
JUST THINK ABOUT THE FEELING 
TO WALK ON TO A STAGE 
AND YOU'VE GOT SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE OUT THERE TO SEE YOU 
ADULATION FROM MASSES OF PEOPLE IS POWER 
AND IT DISTORTS 
THE ADRENALIN THAT YOU GET FROM STAGE IT'S INCREDIBLY GOOD WHEN IT'S USED 
BUT IF YOU CAN'T USE IT IT'S INCREDIBLY DESTRUCTIVE 
KEITH AND JOHN TOGETHER WERE A DANGEROUS DOUBLE ACT 
I WAS VERY NAIVE I DIDN'T REALISE HOW MUCH COKE THEY WERE DOING AS WELL AS DRINKING 
AND KEITH WAS DOING EVERYTHING ELSE 
MANDRAX TO GO TO SLEEP ELEPHANT TRANQUILLISER 
ANYTHING ANYBODY GAVE HIM HE WOULD DO 
WHO KNOWS WHAT WAS GOING ON IN HIS BRAIN 
I SOMETIMES FEEL THAT HE STARTED TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS INVINCIBLE 
I CAN TAKE ANYTHING I'M KEITH MOON OF THE WHO 
HE WAS FALLING DOWN WITH DRUG OVERDOSES ON THE STAGE 
DURING THE SHOWS 
I THOUGHT IF WE KEPT DOING WHAT WE WERE DOING KEITH WAS GOING TO DIE 
AFTER THE QUADROPHENIA TOUR 
THE WHO DID NOT TAKE THE STAGE AGAIN FOR SIXTEEN MONTHS 
WE WERE OFF THE ROAD FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME 
AND THAT IN ITSELF WAS DESTRUCTIVE TO KEITH 
KEITH JUST USED TO GO OUT ON BENDERS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO 
HE LOVED DRESSING UP 
THE TROUBLE IS YOU'D END UP IN A NIGHTCLUB WITH HIM DRESSED UP AS A TART OR A CAVALIER 
AND THEN AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING 
YOU'RE GOING HOME AND HE IS STILL THAT PERSON 
WE'D JUST BOOK A HOTEL IN LONDON AND HE WOULD PULL ALL THE SWEDISH MODELS OUT OF TRAMPS 
FOR FOUR NIGHTS AND EXCUSE MY FRENCH SHAG OURSELVES TO DEATH 
I USED TO DRIVE HIM HOME AND HE WAS LIKE THAT IN THE CAR 
AND I'D JUST GET HIM OUTSIDE BY THE GATES 
OH DEAR BOY WHAT A BRILLIANT FOUR DAYS LET'S DO THAT AGAIN NEXT WEEK AND I'D GO YEAH O. K. 
DOUGAL WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR KEITH 
HE WAS A GOOD ROADIE HE WAS A GOOD DRIVER HE WAS A GOOD CORNERMAN 
MOON'S PREVIOUS CORNERMAN WAS KILLED ON THE JOB 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY HIS CHILDHOOD FRIEND NEIL BOLAND 
WAS ACCIDENTALLY RUN OVER BY KEITH 
DURING AN ALCOHOL FUELLED SCUFFLE OUTSIDE A NIGHTCLUB 
NOBODY'S REALLY CLEAR ON WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT 
BUT KEITH'S JOURNEY OF EXPERIENCE 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR MOON MOVED TO MALIBU 
HOME OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SURFER MUSIC HE LOVED SO MUCH 
HERE BY THE SEA AND SAND 
NOTHING EVER GOES AS PLANNED 
I JUST COULDN'T FACE GOING HOME 
IT WAS JUST A DRAG ON MY OWN 
HE WANTED TO GET INTO MOVIES PEOPLE WOULD SAY OH YOU'D MAKE A GREAT MOVIE STAR 
AT THE END IT BECAME TOO MUCH 
I MADE A PHONE CALL TO BILL CURBISHLEY AND I SAID LOOK I'M LEAVING 
I SAID BECAUSE I CAN'T DO IT 
I DID SAY TO BILL GET HIM HOME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
BECAUSE THE WAY HE'S CARRYING ON HE'S NOT GOING TO BE HERE MUCH LONGER 
NOTHING IS PLANNED BY THE SEA AND THE SAND 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE TOMMY WAS IMMORTALISED ON FILM BUT NOT BY KIT LAMBERT 
DIRECTOR KEN RUSSELL WROTE A NEW SCRIPT FOR THE ROCK OPERA 
THE FILM IS APPALLING RIGHT IT'S DREADFUL 
AND EVERYBODY IN IT REALLY SHOULD QUESTION THEIR FUCKING JUDGMENT 
PARTICULARLY ERIC CLAPTON 
A BIT PANTS 
A LITTLE BIT PANTS 
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF KEN'S BOTH AS A PERSON AND A VISIONARY AND I LOVE IT 
I JUST LOVE IT 
TOMMY SPENT FOURTEEN WEEKS ATOP THE BRITISH BOX OFFICE 
AND GARNERED THREE ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS 
AS HIS MOST POPULAR CREATION TOOK ANOTHER LAP AROUND THE WORLD PETE WENT TO WORK ON A NEW ALBUM 
I WOULD THINK I CAN'T GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN 
I JUST CAN'T GO THROUGH IT AGAIN I CAN'T COME UP WITH SOME GREAT IDEA AND PUSH IT THROUGH 
WHERE WE SAW OUR FUTURE WAS IN MOVIES 
WE'D ALREADY DONE TOMMY 
WE'D MANAGED TO GET A FOOTHOLD IN SHEPPERTON STUDIOS 
WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO BE ABOUT MOVIES 
MANAGER BILL CURBISHLEY WOULD STRIKE A DEAL TO PRODUCE THE FILM OF QUADROPHENIA 
AS THEY PURSUED THE NEW POPULAR ART FORM A NEW GENERATION BEGAN TAKING OVER MUSIC 
PUNK I HATED IT I COULDN'T SEE THE POINT OF SPITTING AND ALL THAT CRAP 
IT WAS THE REVOLUTION OF THE UGLIES 
AND THE UGLIES LOVED THE WHO 
YOU KNOW THEY COME UNDER THAT CATEGORY A LITTLE BIT 
OF BIG STARS THAT WEREN'T APPROACHABLE 
WE WERE FRIGHTENED IT WAS LIKE THE FRENCH REVOLUTION 
IT COULD HAVE ENDED UP WITH THE BEATLES THE STONES AND THE WHO BEING BEHEADED IN PUBLIC 
I WAS BORN WITH A PLASTIC SPOON IN MY MOUTH 
ME AND COOKIE WENT DOWN THE SPEAKEASY WHICH WAS AN AFTER HOURS PLACE IN LONDON 
TOWNSHEND WAS IN THERE ALREADY DRUNK 
HE WENT SCREAMING UP TO JONES AND COOK 
AND KIND OF GOING IF YOU WANT TO TAKE OVER FUCKING TAKE OVER 
JUST FUCKING GET ON WITH IT GOOD FUCKING LUCK 
I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALL A BIT TIPSY BUT HE WAS HAMMERED 
HE WAS GOING UP TO PEOPLE SAYING WHO ARE YOU WHO ARE YOU TO EVERYONE 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN KEITH RETURNED TO ENGLAND 
PETE HAD BEEN WRITING NEW MATERIAL 
WHO ARE YOU 
OOH OOH OOH OOH 
WHO ARE YOU 
WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU 
THAT DECEMBER THEY FILMED A PERFORMANCE FOR THE BAND'S LATEST PROJECT A DOCUMENTARY FILM 
WHO ARE YOU 
TELL ME WHO ARE YOU 
IT WAS THEIR FIRST TIME BACK ON STAGE IN MORE THAN A YEAR 
OH TELL ME WHO ARE YOU WHO ARE YOU 
I WOKE UP IN A SOHO DOORWAY A POLICEMAN KNEW MY NAME 
HE SAID YOU CAN GO SLEEP AT HOME TONIGHT 
IF YOU CAN GET UP AND WALK AWAY 
I STAGGERED BACK TO THE UNDERGROUND 
AND THE BREEZE BLEW BACK MY HAIR 
I REMEMBER THROWIN' PUNCHES AROUND 
AND PREACHIN' FROM MY CHAIR 
WHO ARE YOU 
UNFORTUNATELY THE BAND DIDN'T PLAY AS WELL 
BUT WE ALL I THINK ALL OF US HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME TOGETHER 
BUT WE WERE ALL WRECKS SO IT WAS LIKE THAT 
GUITAR SOLO 
WHO ARE YOU 
OOH OOH OOH OOH 
I REALLY WANNA KNOW WHO ARE YOU 
OOH OOH OOH OOH OH WHO ARE YOU 
IN THE SPRING OF NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THEY WENT BACK INTO THE STUDIO 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE YEARS 
THAT SUMMER MOON BEGAN TAKING PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE TO TRY AND CURB HIS DRINKING 
KEITH DID THAT THING OF 
I SAID COME ON GIVE IT A REAL GO AND HE'D START TO TRY AND PLAY 
AND I SAID COME ON TRY AGAIN 
AND IN THE END HE THREW DOWN HIS STICKS AND WENT 
I'M STIL HAVING A BAD DAY 
BUT I'M STILL THE BEST FUCKING KEITH MOON TYPE DRUMMER IN THE WORLD 
WHO ARE YOU 
OOH OOH OOH OOH 
I REALLY WANNA KNOW 
WHO ARE YOU WAS RELEASED AUGUST EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT 
I REALLY WANNA KNOW WHO ARE YOU 
WHO 
I REALLY WANNA KNOW 
I REALLY WANNA KNOW 
COME ON TELL ME WHO ARE YOU YOU 
YOU WHO ARE YOU 
HE WAS FOUND UNCONSCIOUS IN A LONDON FLAT THIS MORNING 
A DOCTOR WAS CALLED WHO PRONOUNCED MOON DEAD 
HE WAS FOUND DEAD BY HIS GIRLFRIEND EARLY TODAY HE WAS THIRTY TWO 
IT WAS A SILLY MISTAKE THAT MADE HIM TAKE A HANDFUL OF HEMINEVRIN 
AND IT DISABLES THE OESOPHAGUS 
AND YOU KNOW HE COULDN'T THROW UP 
HE JUST ALWAYS TOOK PILLS IN HANDFULS 
IT WAS JUST A HABIT THAT HE HAD 
HE WAS NEVER GONNA GROW OLD GRACEFULLY 
I DON'T THINK HE WAS DESTINED TO MAKE OLD BONES 
I SUPPOSE HE WAS DESIGNED IN SUCH A WAY TO BE REMEMBERED AS HE WAS 
IT IS THE END OF AN ERA 
WE'RE GONNA TRY AND GO ON 
BUT THE ONE THING THAT EVERYONE MUST UNDERSTAND IT WILL NEVER EVER BE THE SAME THAT DIED 
BUT IT WAS VERY STRANGE BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMETHING UNDERNEATH DETERMINED NOT TO LET 
THE ONE THING THAT WE'D ALL CREATED INCLUDING KEITH DIE 
THE MUSIC NOT TO LET IT DIE 
LONG LIVE ROCK 
I NEED IT EVERY NIGHT 
LONG LIVE ROCK 
COME ON AND JOIN THE LINE 
LONG LIVE ROCK 
BE IT DEAD OR ALIVE 
LESS THAN EIGHT MONTHS AFTER MOONIE'S DEATH 
THE WHO RETURNED TO THE STAGE WITH KEYBOARD PLAYER RABBIT BUNDRICK AND DRUMMER KENNEY JONES 
KENNEY JONES WAS A GOOD MATE FROM THE SMALL FACES 
AND WE'D ALWAYS ADMIRED HIM AS A DRUMMER AND WE LIKED HIM AS A GUY 
ANYTHING CAN CHANGE ESPECIALLY 
YOU KNOW WITH PETE 
SO YOU JUST GO WITH IT YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW WHEN TO GO WITH IT 
I WENT TO SEE THE WHO FOR THE FIRST TIME WITHOUT KEITH 
AND I'M STANDING AT THE SIDE OF THE STAGE 
AND PETE GOES OFF ONTO SOME SORT OF FREESTYLE RIFF ON HIS GUITAR 
AND HE TURNS TO KEITH 
BECAUSE HE'S GONE AS FAR AS HE CAN GO 
SO HE TURNS TO KEITH TO TAKE IT OVER 
THOSE MOMENTS BACK ON THE STAGE WHEN I'M TAKEN ABACK BECAUSE I LOOK AND I EXPECT HIM TO BE THERE 
IT'S BECAUSE IT IS LIKE A MARRIAGE 
LONG LIVE ROCK 
WE'RE GONNA JOIN THE LINE 
A REAL SENSE OF CONNECTION AND OF LIFE WANTING TO KIND OF GO ON LIKE A WHEEL 
AND THINKING WELL EVERYTHING THAT GOES COMES BACK AGAIN 
BUT WITH PEOPLE IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT AND THEY DON'T COME BACK AGAIN 
LET'S HAVE THE BIGGEST HAND OF THE NIGHT 
FOR MR. KENNEY JONES OUR NEW DRUMMER 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS LETTING MYSELF IN FOR TO BE HONEST 
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WAS I STARTED TO DRIFT INTO SUBSTANCES YOU KNOW 
PETE'S ADDICTION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WAS PERHAPS A REFLECTION OF 
I THINK THE GUILT THAT I'M SURE PETE FELT 
COS I KNOW I DID THAT I HADN'T DONE ENOUGH ENOUGH TO SAVE KEITH 
BUT YOU KNOW EVEN I STARTED TO DO THINGS I'D NEVER DONE BEFORE 
I FELT VERY MISERABLE FOR A LONG TIME 
ROGER WAS OBVIOUSLY MISSING MOONIE 
NOT JUST ON STAGE BUT IN MANY OTHER WAYS 
AND I THINK IT REALLY GOT TO HIM A BIT 
BUT I DIDN'T BANK ON THE EMOTIONAL ELEMENTS YOU KNOW 
DURING KENNEY'S FIRST TOUR THE WHO PLAYED THROUGH THE DEADLIEST ROCK CONCERT IN U. S. HISTORY 
CINCINNATI WAS AN EMOTIONALLY DEVASTATING SITUATION 
THE BAND WERE LIKE TWENTY MINUTES INTO THEIR SHOW 
THE CO PROMOTER CAME TO ME AND HE SAID WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM UP ON THE PLAZA LEVEL 
THERE WAS ONLY ONE DOOR TO GET THROUGH AND A STAIRCASE TO GO DOWN SO THEY ALL RUSHED 
AND THOSE KIDS THAT FELL GOT TRAMPLED ON 
THE BAND WERE UNAWARE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING UNTIL THEY FINISHED THE SHOW 
WE HAD TO GO BACK TO AMERICA A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER AND BE GRILLED BY THE LAWYERS 
DO YOU FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DIED YOU KNOW 
IT STILL HAUNTS ME TO THIS DAY 
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW I FELT ABOUT 
THE PARENTS OF THOSE KIDS 
THEIR KIDS HAD GONE OFF TO A CONCERT AND THEY DON'T COME HOME 
WE ALL BEAR SCARS BUT YOU DON'T LIVE WITHOUT 
HAVING THAT MAP OF LIFE SOMEWHERE ON YOUR FACE 
THEY RELEASED TWO ALBUMS IN TWO YEARS 
FACE DANCES IN EIGHTY ONE 
AND IT'S HARD IN EIGHTY TWO ONLY TO BE SAVAGED BY SOME FANS AND CRITICS 
WHEN YOU READ THE NEWSPAPERS AND THE REVIEWS IT'S LIKE 
THIS ALBUM IS THE WORST THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED IN THE HISTORY OF ROCK AND ROLL 
TOWNSHEND HAS GONE MAD AND IS MASTURBATING IN PUBLIC THEY MAY AS WELL CRAWL AWAY AND DIE 
THE SUN SHINES 
AND PEOPLE FORGET 
SPRAY FLIES 
AS THE SPEEDBOAT GLIDES 
AND PEOPLE FORGET 
THE MAN WHO ENCOURAGED PETE TO WRITE WORKS OF ART 
DIED OF A BRAIN HAEMORRHAGE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE 
KIT LAMBERT WAS FORTY FIVE 
I DIDN'T HAVE AN ANSWER 
I COULDN'T WORK OUT WHAT TO DO THAT WOULD RETURN THE BAND TO ITS HALCYON YEARS 
AS THE SKIER TRACKS 
PEOPLE FORGET 
FORGET THEY'RE HIDING 
BEHIND AN EMINENCE FRONT 
WHAT MAKES THE WHO SPECIAL IS NOT EVEN WHAT'S WRITTEN 
IT'S THE BITS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ARE GOING TO HAPPEN THEY COME OUT OF THIN AIR SOME NIGHTS IT MAKES IT 
SOME NIGHTS IT DOESN'T BUT THE NIGHTS THAT IT MAKES IT 
THAT WAS THE TROUBLE WITH KENNEY THOSE NIGHTS BECAME FEWER AND FEWER 
IT WAS ROGER WHO PUSHED TO GET HIM OUT OF THE BAND HE DIDN'T THINK HE WAS RIGHT FOR THE WHO 
THERE IS NO RIGHT DRUMMER FOR THE WHO 
THERE WILL NEVER BE THE RIGHT DRUMMER FOR THE WHO IT WILL ONLY BE KEITH 
BUT THERE YOU GO 
EMINENCE FRONT YEAH 
JUST AN EMINENCE FRONT IT'S A PUT ON 
JUST A PUT ON IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE PETE OFFICIALLY DISSOLVED THE BAND 
JUST MONTHS BEFORE TOMMY WAS REISSUED ON THE NEW FORMAT THE COMPACT DISC 
PUSH IT PUSH IT YEAH YEAH YEAH 
WE'VE JUST REACHED THE END YOU KNOW IT'S THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT IT 
I DON'T KNOW WHY BYE BYE I CAN'T WAIT TO GET OUT 
YOU GOT YOUR DRESSES TO KILL 
DRESS YOURSELF TO KILL 
YOU'D BEEN TRAVELLING ON THIS THING THAT WAS GOING A MILLION MILES AN HOUR 
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT COMES TO A COMPLETE DEAD STOP 
AND IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO ADJUST 
BECAUSE WE HADN'T LIVED NORMAL LIVES 
IT'S AS THOUGH THE WORLD STOPS 
AT THE TIME I WAS FAIRLY CONVINCED 
THAT I WOULD DO BETTER AS A SOLO ARTIST IT WAS A PRAGMATIC DECISION 
WHETHER IT WAS THE RIGHT OR THE WRONG DECISION I HAD TO DO SOMETHING 
I THINK IF WE'D HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK I THINK I WOULD HAVE BEEN A CASUALTY 
I BLAMED ROCK AND ROLL AND OF COURSE AFTER THREE OR FOUR YEARS BEING OUT OF FRONTLINE ROCK AND ROLL 
I REALISED I WAS JUST AS SICK JUST AS MAD AND JUST AS OVERWORKED 
SO IT WAS ME THAT WAS THE PROBLEM 
THE WHO RETURNED TO THE STAGE ON ONLY TWO OCCASIONS OVER THE NEXT THIRTEEN YEARS 
A TWENTY MINUTE SET AT LIVE AID AND AN ALL STAR TOUR FOR THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF TOMMY 
THAT'S THE WEIRD THING IT'S LIKE SOLDIERS THAT USED TO GO OUT TO WAR 
AND COME BACK AND JUST CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH NORMAL LIFE ANY MORE 
WHEN YOU COME HOME IT'S LIKE I CAN'T TAKE THIS NORMAL EXISTENCE 
JOHN LIVED FOR GIGGING 
HE WENT OUT WITH HIS SOLO BANDS AND IT COST HIM 
HE FINANCED IT HE DIDN'T MAKE ANY MONEY JUST TO BE OUT THERE 
JOHN WAS DEEPLY IN DEBT 
I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY SECRET THAT HE WAS 
THOSE YEARS WHEN THE WHO WEREN'T WORKING HE CONTINUED TO SPEND AND LIVE THE LIFESTYLE 
I WENT TO PETE AND SAID YOU KNOW 
THE ONLY WAY HE'S EVER GOING TO GET A CHANCE TO DIG HIMSELF OUT OF THE HOLE 
IS IF YOU WOULD GET THE WHO BACK TOGETHER 
WHY SHOULD I CARE 
WHY SHOULD I CARE 
I WOULD NEVER HESITATE TO CONSIDER AT LEAST THAT IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO DO 
BECAUSE I WOULD JUST THINK WELL WITHOUT HIM I WOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE 
PETE AGREED TO TOUR QUADROPHENIA IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX 
THE BAND BROUGHT IN RINGO STARR'S SON ZAK STARKEY ON DRUMS 
AS SOON AS WE PLAYED THOSE SONGS MOONIE WAS ALIVE AGAIN 
GIRLS OF FIFTEEN 
SEXUALLY KNOWING 
THE USHERS ARE SNIVELLING 
EAU DE COLOGNING 
AT THE END JOHN WAS HANDED CHEQUES OF WELL OVER TWO DOLLARS THREE MILLION DOLLARS 
AND THEY WERE GONE OVERNIGHT 
WITH JOHN IN FINANCIAL TROUBLE THEY AGREED TO YET ANOTHER REUNION IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WITH JUST THEIR BASIC LINE UP 
I'VE GOT A FEELING INSIDE CAN'T EXPLAIN 
IT'S A CERTAIN KIND CAN'T EXPLAIN 
JOHN NEVER SEEMED TO GO INTO A DEPRESSION 
AS LONG AS THERE WAS A NICE BIG WARDROBE WITH FIFTEEN PAIRS OF SHOES IN IT 
AND THE OBLIGATORY SERIALLY MONOGAMOUS GIRLFRIEND ALONG HE WAS HAPPY 
UNDER THE CONTINUED LEADERSHIP OF MANAGER BILL CURBISHLEY THE BAND AGREED TO A SERIES OF LIVE SHOWS 
I CAN'T EXPLAIN I THINK IT'S LOVE 
TRY TO SAY IT TO YOU WHEN I FEEL BLUE 
BUT I CAN'T EXPLAIN SOMETHING HAPPENED THEN 
PETE BECAME INSPIRED AGAIN IT WAS LIKE THE WHEEL WAS BACK ON THE BARROW 
WE WERE JUST CELEBRATING THE OLD MUSIC 
I FELT LIKE WE SHOULD JUST ACCEPT THAT YOU KNOW 
WE HAD THESE GREAT SONGS AND I WAS NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO SURPASS THEM 
I SAID I CAN'T EXPLAIN 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN BY THE WHO 
MUSIC IS AN ART FORM 
THAT ART FORM INCLUDES RHYTHM MEANING AND COMMUNICATION 
I'VE MET PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE 
AND THEY'VE ALL BEEN TOUCHED IN SUCH A UNIQUE AND PURE WAY 
THEY REALLY FEEL THIS DEEP CONNECTION 
SO NOW YOU'VE GOT FOR ME THE GREATEST ART FORM THAT EVER EXISTED 
WE'LL BE FIGHTING IN THE STREETS 
WITH OUR CHILDREN AT OUR FEET 
AND THE MORALS THAT THEY WORSHIP WILL BE GONE 
AND THE MEN WHO SPURRED US ON 
WHEN WE GOT THAT CALL ABOUT THE CONCERT FOR NEW YORK 
AMERICA MEANT SO MUCH TO THE WHO WE HAD TO GO 
I'LL TIP MY HAT TO THE NEW CONSTITUTION 
TAKE A BOW FOR THE NEW REVOLUTION 
SMILE AND GRIN AT THE CHANGE ALL AROUND 
PICK UP MY GUITAR AND PLAY 
I WAS STANDING JUST OFF THE STAGE 
FOR ME OVER ALL THOSE YEARS OF WATCHING THE WHO 
MAN I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
WE DON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN 
OH 
I WAS SITTING WITH BONO THE TWO OF US JUST COULD NOT BELIEVE IT 
THE WAY THEY JUST OWNED THAT EVENT OVER THE T. V. 
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE STREET 
LOOKS ANY DIFFERENT TO ME 
AND THE SLOGANS ARE REPLACED BY THE BYE 
JUST SO MUCH MORE POWERFUL LIVE THAN ANYONE ELSE THAT WAS ON THE BILL THAT NIGHT 
THAT SHOW IN NEW YORK 
THAT COULD BE ONE OF THE BEST ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE POWER OF MUSIC 
YEAH 
WON'T GET FOOLED 
THE SENTIMENTS TO THOSE SONGS 
IF I COULD EXPLAIN IT TO YOU RIGHT IT WOULD 
IT WOULD BE TOO EASY TO EXPLAIN TO YOU 
IT'S MAGIC HOW THOSE SONGS CAME FROM SHEPHERD'S BUSH YOU KNOW 
AND MEAN AS MUCH TO PEOPLE FORTY YEARS LATER THAN THEY DID WHEN THEY WERE WRITTEN 
THAT'S PHENOMENAL AND THAT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN'T PUT INTO WORDS 
IT'S JUST MAGIC 
THEY WERE BACK IN A BIG BIG WAY BACK AS A FOUR PIECE BACK ON THE ROAD 
IT WAS LIKE A REBIRTH AGAIN 
WE HAD TO GO BACK AND PLAY THERE WE HAD A CONTRACT TO PLAY LAS VEGAS 
I FLEW OUT TO LAS VEGAS AND THE NEXT MORNING 
GOT A CALL FROM MY TOUR MANAGER SAYING THEY COULDN'T WAKE JOHN UP 
IT JUST PUT SOMETHING INTO A LITTLE BIT OF PERSPECTIVE 
JOHN WAS ONE OF THE BEST BASS PLAYERS IN THE WORLD 
JOHN DIED AT THE AGE OF NEARLY SIXTY WITH A WOMAN IN BED AFTER SNORTING COCAINE 
NOW YOU THINK HOLD ON JOHN YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS IN THE SEVENTIES NOT NOW 
THE CORONER'S REPORT OF THE SITUATION IN LAS VEGAS IS QUITE CLEAR 
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE DOING WHAT HE WAS DOING 
AND IT WAS CRAZY IT'S KIND OF WHAT HE CHOSE TO DO 
THAT'S JUST HOW HE WAS 
I DID HAVE A CHUCKLE 
I MEAN IF HE WAS GOING TO GO HE COULDN'T HAVE GONE IN A BETTER WAY REALLY 
ON TOUR DOING ALL THE THINGS AND BEING AROUND THE THINGS THAT HE LOVED BEST YOU KNOW 
I THINK ALL OF US WANT TO DIE ON STAGE 
I MEAN NONE OF US WANT TO BE ER JUST WRITTEN OFF 
IT'S GET MORE DIFFICULT AS YOU GET OLDER 
HOW DO I SAY THIS 
LET'S SAY FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE YOU'RE A FIFTY EIGHT YEAR OLD GUY 
WHO'S BEEN IN A BAND FROM THE SIXTIES RIGHT 
IT'S IT'S FUCKING FROWNED UPON IN THIS COUNTRY 
IT'S LIKE GOD YOU FUCKING IDIOT WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOU SILLY OLD MAN 
WE HAVE THIS TENDENCY TO KIND OF TAKE THE PISS OUT OF THINGS LIKE THAT 
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS YOU KNOW 
WE SHOULDN'T STOP 
THEY MADE MY DREAM COME TRUE 
THEY MADE MY DREAM COME TRUE 
PETE RANG ME BACK AND SAID I WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THIS TOUR 
IF WE'D HAVE SPLIT UP AND GONE OUR OWN WAYS THE NEXT DAY I THINK WE WOULD HAVE PROBABLY 
FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO GET BACK TOGETHER ON A STAGE 
THE WHO PERFORMED FOUR DAYS LATER AT THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL IN LOS ANGELES 
PINO PALLADINO WAS THE BAND'S FIRST CHOICE TO FILL IN ON BASS 
LISTEN WE KNOW 
THIS FOR SOME OF THE FANS THAT HAVE FOLLOWED US FOR MANY YEARS 
THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT AND ER 
WE UNDERSTAND AND WE'RE NOT PRETENDING THAT NOTHING'S HAPPENED AS ROGER SAID EARLIER ON AND ER 
AND IT IS DIFFICULT 
I CAN TELL YOU WITH MY HAND ON MY HEART THAT WHEN I DID LOOK OVER THERE 
AND HE WASN'T THERE I WANTED TO DIE I JUST WANTED TO DIE 
THIS SONG IS OVER 
I'M LEFT WITH ONLY TEARS 
I MUST REMEMBER 
EVEN IF IT TAKES A MILLION YEARS 
IF MOON WAS PREDICTABLE THEN JOHN WAS UNNECESSARY 
A GREAT GREAT LOSS 
A GREAT LOSS JOHN 
I MISS HIM SO MUCH I CAN'T TELL YOU 
WHAT'S ACTUALLY NOW HAPPENED A FURTHER GIFT THAT JOHN'S DEATH HAS GIVEN ME 
IS TO ENJOY AN ACUTELY EMPHATIC RELATIONSHIP WITH ROGER 
YOU KNOW WE EXPERIENCED JOHN'S DEATH HE SAW ME GET ARRESTED 
FOR YOU KNOW A CHILD PORNOGRAPHY ALLEGATION 
HOW DARE YOU WEAR A ROBE TO PRESIDE 
HOW DARE YOU COVER YOUR HEAD TO HIDE 
YOUR FACE FROM GOD 
HE WAS VILIFIED HE WAS DRAGGED ACROSS THE FUCKING NATIONAL PAPERS 
IN A SCURRILOUS WAY YOU KNOW 
AND AFTER MONTHS OF INVESTIGATION 
THEY ESTABLISHED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD BE CHARGED WITH 
IN THE END NOBODY MUCH IS GOING TO LISTEN TO ME 
BUT ROGER DALTREY HIS PARTNER 
HE WENT TO BAT FOR HIM AND HE WAS UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE ROGER 
HOW DARE YOU DO YOU THINK I'LL QUIETLY GO 
YOU ARE MUCH BRAVER THAN YOU KNOW 
FOR I CAN'T DIE 
ROGER IS THE VOICE OF THE WHO AND WHEN YOU'RE GROWING UP 
YOU THOUGHT HE WROTE ALL THOSE THINGS AND HE'S SINGING THEM FROM HIS HEART AND 
AND THEN YOU REALISE THAT IT'S COMING FROM THIS GUY PETE 
THAT'S WHEN REALISED THERE WAS SOMETHING DEEPER GOING ON 
THEY'RE TWO INCREDIBLY STRONG FORCES AND THEY'VE RELIED ON EACH OTHER FOR YEARS 
SINCE JOHN DIED WE'RE PROBABLY MUSICALLY MORE TOGETHER 
I'M SURE SPIRITUALLY WE ARE 
WILL YOU HAVE SOME TEA 
AT THE THEATRE WITH ME 
WE DID IT ALL 
DIDN'T WE 
JUMPED EVERY WALL 
I THINK ROGER IS THE BEST INTERPRETER OF MY WORK THAT I COULD HAVE EVER HOPED FOR 
UNRAVELLED CODES 
INGENIOUSLY 
WHAT'S VERY INTERESTING ABOUT WHAT ROGER AND I ARE LEFT WITH IS THAT WE HAVE A VERY PURE RELATIONSHIP 
SO SEAMLESSLY 
WE MADE IT WORK 
I RECOGNISE HIS GENIUS AND I LOVE HIM DEARLY HE'S LIKE A BROTHER 
YOU KNOW THAT'S LOVE 
EVEN THOUGH ON THE OUTSIDE AND WHEN YOU READ THINGS ABOUT WHAT WE DID IN THE PAST AND FIGHTS WE USED TO HAVE 
YOU THINK THESE GUYS USED TO HATE EACH OTHER DID WE FUCK 
YOU KNOW 
WELL I DIDN'T ANYWAY I LOVED HIM 
A GREAT DREAM DERAILED 
HE'S MY FRIEND I LOVE HIM 
AND I STAND BY HIM AND HE STANDS BY ME 
WE CAN SAY WHAT WE LIKE ABOUT EACH OTHER NOW 
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT EASY FOR EITHER OF US BECAUSE WE'RE SO UNBELIEVABLY UN ALIKE 
BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE KIND OF ALL WE'VE GOT NOW 
ONE OF US ME ALL OF US SAD 
IT IS REALLY NOT IMPORTANT WHETHER I AM AT THE TIME GETTING ON WITH PETE OR HE'S GETTING ON WITH ME 
IT DOESN'T MATTER ALL THAT MATTERS IS WHAT WE CREATE ON THE STAGE THAT TWO HOURS OF MUSIC THAT NIGHT 
AND AS LONG AS THAT IS STILL MOVING PEOPLE AND SENDING PEOPLE OUT WITH A BUZZ THEN WE'RE SUCCEEDING 
WILL YOU HAVE SOME TEA 
AT THE THEATRE WITH ME 
ONE TWO 
ONE TWO THREE 
PEOPLE TRY TO PUT US DOWN TALKING ABOUT MY GENERATION 
JUST BECAUSE WE GET AROUND TALKING ABOUT MY GENERATION 
THINGS THEY DO LOOK AWFUL COLD TALKING ABOUT MY GENERATION 
I HOPE I DIE BEFORE I GET OLD TALKING ABOUT MY GENERATION 
MY GENERATION 
MY GENERATION BABY 
WHY DON'T YOU ALL FADE AWAY TALKING ABOUT MY GENERATION 
DON'T TRY AND DIG WHAT WE ALL SAY TALKING ABOUT MY GENERATION 
NOT TRYING TO CAUSE A BIG SENSATION TALKING ABOUT MY GENERATION 
TALKING ABOUT MY GENERATION TALKING ABOUT MY GENERATION 
MY GENERATION TALKING ABOUT MY GENERATION 
MY GENERATION TALKING ABOUT MY GENERATION 
WHY DON'T YOU ALL FADE AWAY TALKING ABOUT MY GENERATION 
DON'T TRY TO DIG WHAT WE ALL SAY TALKING ABOUT MY GENERATION 
NOT TRYING TO CAUSE A BIG SENSATION TALKING ABOUT MY GENERATION 
TALKING ABOUT MY GENERATION TALKING ABOUT MY GENERATION
