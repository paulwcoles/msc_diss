IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF PARMA HAM FROM ITALY YES IT IS

WE HAD HALF OF A LEG OF A PIG AND WE WERE CUTTING IT EVERY SINGLE DAY WE WERE ON HOLIDAY 
AND WE NAMED THE PIG MARLENE MARLENE 
AND FINALLY HAGGIS OH LOVELY 
I LIKED THE IDEA OF RICHARD HAVING TO DO SOMETHING INTERESTING WITH HAGGIS 
HOW MUCH WAS ALL OF THAT THEN I WAS SLIGHTLY OVER I HAVE TO SAY 
SEVEN POINT FIVE FIVE SEVEN POINT FIVE FIVE IS THAT ALLOWED IT'S CERTAINLY ALLOWED THE WAY YOU'VE DESCRIBED IT SO BEAUTIFULLY 
WHAT ABOUT OUR CHEF WHAT DO YOU THINK RICHARD'S GONNA DO LET'S FIND OUT 
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO I THINK SOMETHING FAIRLY EXCITING WITH HAGGIS 
WHY DON'T WE MAKE A LITTLE PIE FROM THIS 
I'LL MAKE A PASTRY COOK THIS DOWN WITH A BIT OF SERRANO HAM

I'M REALLY GOOD UNDER PRESSURE WE ALL START PANICKING THERE YOU GO 
THANK YOU YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO THERE YOU GO YEP 
OH LOVELY MR. HARRIOT MR. VICKERY WHERE ARE WE STARTING SIR 
WE'LL MAKE SOME PASTRY FIRST BUT I WANT TO MAKE A RICH PASTRY SO 
WILL THAT MEAN EGG YOLK EGG YOLK OR WHOLE EGG ACTUALLY O. K. 
I'M ALSO GONNA USE SELF RAISING FLOUR RATHER THAN PLAIN FLOUR 
IT JUST MAKES THE PASTRY RISE A BIT BETTER 
BUT YOU'VE ALSO GOTTA BE I'D BETTER PUT SOME PANS ON HADN'T I 
DO YOU EVER PUT MILK INTO YOUR PASTRY PHIL OR IS IT ALWAYS WATER 
I ALWAYS USE WATER ACTUALLY O. K. 
TO BE QUITE HONEST IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE UNLESS YOU MAKE A SWEET DISH I THINK 
I LIKE TO PUT MORE BUTTER IN THAN NORMAL 
IT MAKES A REALLY RICH PASTRY AND THE MORE BUTTER YOU PUT IN THE RICHER THE PASTRY WILL BE 
BY THAT I MEAN THE CRUMBLIER IT WILL BE AH RIGHT O. K. 
AND A FEW HERBS ADDED TO IT I WANT TO MAKE A GREEN PASTRY BECAUSE I WANT TO TAKE THAT COLOUR OFF IT 
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL YOU DON'T OVERWORK THE GLUTEN 
GLUTEN'S A PROTEIN AND IF YOU OVERWORK IT IT WILL SHRINK BACK OUT OF YOUR DISH 
SO BASICALLY THE QUICKER YOU MAKE IT THE BETTER 
ABSOLUTELY DO YOU EVER MAKE FRESH PASTRY THEN SAL OF COURSE SHE DOES COURSE SHE DOES 
SAY YES SAY YES SORRY THAT JUST MADE ME LAUGH THAT'LL BE A NO AINSLEY

SIMON MICHAELS HELLO SIMON HOW ARE YOU HI HOW ARE YOU DOING 
FROM THE WILD YEAST BAKERY YES BUT YOU'RE ACTUALLY SPECIALISING IN SOUR DOUGH BREAD 
YES SO TELL US WHAT SOUR DOUGH BREAD IS BECAUSE THERE'S NO YEAST INVOLVED 
YEAH IT'S A VERY OLD WAY OF COOKING BREAD AND IT'S BEEN DONE FOR MANY CENTURIES 
YOU DON'T USE ANY YEAST SO YOU LET THE BREAD RISE NATURALLY 
IT'S A VERY SLOW PROCESS AND IT CREATES TERRIFIC FLAVOUR 
IT'S WONDERFUL I ALWAYS GO FOR THAT ONE IN RESTAURANTS 
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAVOURITE RECIPE ANY FAVOURITE RECIPES 
WELL BREAD'S SO ADAPTABLE YOU CAN USE IT IN ANYTHING REALLY 
ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT REALLY GOOD BREAD LIKE SOUR DOUGH BREAD IS IT LASTS REALLY WELL 
SO IF THE BREAD DRIES OUT THEN YOU CAN USE IT FOR ALL KINDS OF THINGS 
AT CHRISTMAS TIME I MAKE A CHRISTMAS PUDDING WITH SOUR DOUGH BREADCRUMBS AND BUTTER 
INSTEAD OF SUET AND IT'S JUST FANTASTIC REAL DEPTH OF FLAVOUR

COURTESY FROM A LADY FROM SAINT ALBANS FIONA SOAMES HELLO FIONA HELLO HOW ARE YOU DOING

THEY ARE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR JUST PREPARING STUFF FOR OUR CHILDREN 
WELL HE'S MAKING A MANIC NOISE OVER THERE BUT YOU'VE HAD A FEW PROBLEMS WITH YOUR CHOCOLATE 
I HAVE I WAS MELTING SOME CHOCOLATE AND I ACCIDENTALLY GOT A LOT OF HOT WATER IN IT

YOU JUST DUMPED IT REALLY DIDN'T YOU WELL YEAH THE KIDS ATE HALF OF IT THEN I DUMPED THE REST 
AND I HAD TO RUN TO THE SHOPS AND BUY MORE FOR MY CAKE 
THERE YOU GO PHIL VICKERY IS PRETTY HOT IN THAT DEPARTMENT 
WE CALLED IS SEIZED CHOCOLATE WHAT WOULD YOU SAY PHIL IF YOU PUT WATER IN CHOCOLATE FORGET IT 
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT JUST THROW IT AWAY AND START AGAIN 
BUT WHAT I USED TO DO WHEN WE HAD A HOTEL AND YOUNG BOYS WOULD MESS IT UP 
CHILL IT CHOP IT UP AND MAKE A TRUFFLE WITH IT OR A CHOCOLATE MOUSSE 
IT WILL MELT AGAIN WITH A BIT MORE CHOCOLATE BUT AS SOON AS THAT TINY BIT OF MOISTURE 
EVEN THE VAPOUR IN A PAN COULD THICKEN THE CHOCOLATE 
SO THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ONCE THAT'S GONE ON 
CHILL IT CHOP IT UP THEN START AGAIN OR GIVE IT TO THE KIDS 
OR GIVE IT TO THE CAT VERY GOOD THE KIDS LIKE THEIR CHOCOLATE 
ALL RIGHT THEN RICHARD PHILLIPS ANY LITTLE TIPS FOR CHOCOLATE YOU COULD PASS ON TO FIONA
