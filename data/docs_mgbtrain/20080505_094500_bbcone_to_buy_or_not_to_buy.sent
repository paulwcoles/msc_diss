AND THEN YOU CAN USE IT TO ENJOY YOUR LIFE HAVE MORE OF A WILD AND CRAZY LIFE 
COS IT IS WILD AND CRAZY YOU'RE NOT CASUAL CARAVANNERS ARE YOU

YES ARE YOU INSANE

BUT WE ARE MEMBERS OF THE BLUE NOSE CLUB CARAVANNERS 
BLUE NOSE CLUB BLUE NOSE CLUB CARAVANNERS 
SO WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR FOR YOUR NEXT PLACE 
SOMETHING LIKE A STATIC CARAVAN OR A PARK HOME WOULD BE IDEAL 
IT'S A LOT SMALLER THAN THIS AND IT'S GOT EVERYTHING WE WOULD NEED 
WHAT APPEALS TO YOU ABOUT THOSE 
YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY THERE TO LOOK AFTER THE PROPERTY WHEN YOU'RE NOT THERE 
EVERYTHING'S TAKEN CARE OF ALL WE'VE GOT TO DO IS PAY ONE OR TWO BILLS 
WE JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO HITCH UP AND GO 
AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE GRASS CUTTING AND THE HEDGE TRIMMING 
AND THE FLOWERS IT'LL BE NICE TO JUST HITCH UP AND GO 
ARE FAMILY IMPORTANT DO YOU NEED TO STAY IN THIS AREA

WITHIN AN HOUR AND A HALF OF BRADFORD

COME ON EASE OFF ON THE PURSE STRINGS 
IT WAS GOING SO WELL FOR A MINUTE THERE 
SO AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE BUT ER 
WE'LL GO ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED TEN ROUND THAT AREA 
IF WE COULD FIND SOMETHING CHEAPER THAT WOULD FREE UP MORE MONEY 
SO WE'D BE ABLE TO ENJOY OURSELVES A LITTLE BIT MORE

INTERESTING ONE SARAH INTERESTING ONE 
I THINK THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING ONE 
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS YOUNG MAN OUT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK FOR SOME PROPERTIES FOR YOU 
WE'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER AND SEE WHAT WE'VE FOUND 
HAVE A NICE DAY 
SIMON WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS ONE 
THIS IS NORMALLY WHERE I'LL SAY I'LL GO TO THE ESTATE AGENT 
BUT YOU DON'T FIND THESE IN AN ESTATE AGENT 
AND WE DON'T GET TOO MANY REQUESTS FOR RESIDENTIAL PARK HOMES SO I'LL MAKE SOME PHONE CALLS 
I SAW A PARK ON THE WAY IN I'M GONNA CHECK IT OUT SEE YA 
SO WHAT COULD SUE AND PETER GET AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR THEIR MONEY 
IF THEY WANTED TO MOVE FURTHER AFIELD 
THEY COULD BUY THIS THREE BED PARK HOME IN SOMERSET FOR NINETY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
OR IN CARDIFF THIS MODERN TWO BEDROOM DUPLEX APARTMENT COULD BE THEIRS FOR ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
BUT IF THEY WANTED TO STAY IN BRADFORD AND NOT LIVE IN A RESIDENTIAL PARK 
THEY COULD BUY THIS THREE BED TERRACE FOR ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
SUE AND PETER WANT TO LEAVE BRADFORD FOR THE PEACE AND QUIET OF THE SURROUNDING YORKSHIRE COUNTRYSIDE 
THE AREA HAS AROUND FORTY FIVE RESIDENTIAL PARKS 
THAT OFFER VARIOUS KINDS OF FACILITIES FROM RESTAURANTS TO EVEN THEIR OWN PUB 
WE'VE CHOSEN TO TARGET RESIDENTIAL PARKS 
AS OPPOSED TO THE MORE FAMILIAR HOLIDAY PARKS 
SUE AND PETER WANT THEIR MOBILE HOME TO BE THEIR PERMANENT RESIDENCE 
AND NOT A PART TIME HOME 
MOBILE PROPERTY ON A RESIDENTIAL PARK HAS TO BE BUILT TO MORE RIGOROUS SPECIFICATIONS 
THAN THOSE ON HOLIDAY PARKS WHERE PEOPLE ONLY SPEND A FEW MONTHS OF THE YEAR 
WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT'S THE ATTRACTION OF PARK LIFE 
WHILE SARAH STARTS HER SEARCH 
I'M OFF TO FIND OUT WHAT'S SO PERFECT ABOUT PREFAB 
HIYA HOW LONG HAVE YOU LIVED HERE

HIYA YOU'RE THE PARK WARDEN AREN'T YOU I CERTAINLY AM 
IF I WANTED TO BUY A PROPERTY HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT IT 
A LOT OF IT'S WORD OF MOUTH BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY ADVERTISE THEM 
WOULD YOU CONSIDER LIVING ON ONE NO

LITTLE DINING AREA WASHER FRIDGE FREEZER COOKER 
WHILST THE KITCHEN IS SMALL IT'S WELL LAID OUT AND YOU CAN WORK IN IT QUITE EASILY 
IT FLOWS QUITE WELL FOR A TINY KITCHEN

I CAN'T DECIDE WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT THIS CAN YOU 
I THINK THEY THINK THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FIT 
WELL I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU NEED A RIGHT LOT DO YOU 
THEY LIKE THE IDEA OF DOING THIS BUT SEEING THE REALITY YOU REALISE IT'S NOT AS BIG AS YOU THOUGHT 
YOU KNOW THEY'RE FINE WITH THE CARAVAN WHEN THEY'RE CARAVANNING 
BUT MAYBE FOR A BASE THEY DO NEED SOMETHING BIGGER 
I TELL YOU WHAT YOU'VE GOT A GREAT BIG TREE HANGING OVER M. M. M. 
COULD GET A BIT LOUD 
UNLESS THE ROOF IS WELL INSULATED WE'D HAVE TO GO INTO THAT WOULDN'T WE M. M. M. 
BUT JUST ONE GOOD SIZED BEDROOM ISN'T THERE REALLY 
M. M. M. AND THAT OTHER ONE WELL I DON'T THINK IT'S EVEN A BOX ROOM IS IT REALLY 
IT'S SMALL SMALL 
SMALL RIGHT WHERE ARE WE GOING NOW 
AND THE LITTLE BONUS AH HA THE CONSERVATORY 
OOH OH A LITTLE CONSERVATORY A LITTLE CONSERVATORY 
SMASHING FOR YOUR BOOTS YOUR WELLIES AND YOUR WATERPROOFS 
OH MY IT'S LARGER THAN I THOUGHT 
SHAME IT'S NOT ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH THE VIEW BIG SHAME BIG SHAME 
BUT STILL A NICE BIT OF EXTRA SPACE 
YEAH IT'S QUITE DECEPTIVE ISN'T IT YEAH 
YEAH IT'S LONGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS 
SHALL WE GO AND HAVE A LOOK OUTSIDE YEAH DOWN IN THIS LITTLE MINIMALISTIC GARDEN 
THIS SHOULD BE A WINNER THEY DID NOT WANT ANY MAINTENANCE OUTSIDE 
SHE DIDN'T WANT A GARDEN AND THIS IS PERFECT YEAH ALL PAVED NO GRASS JUST HARDY POTS 
OH IT'S GOT A LITTLE SHED 
FOR THE LAWN MOWER THAT WE WON'T NEED 
HOPEFULLY 
THEY CAN GET RID OF A LOT OF STUFF THAT THEY'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT 
THEY'LL NEED NO GARDEN EQUIPMENT A LITTLE TROWEL FOR THE POTS 
IT'S OVER HALF OF THE BUILDING COVERED BY THAT TREE 
H. M. M. 
YES WELL WE SHALL HAVE TO WATCH THAT 
THEY'RE QUITE WORRIED ABOUT THE TREE BUT I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BE 
IT'S IN THE INTEREST OF THE PARK TO MAKE SURE ALL THE HOMES ARE WELL MAINTAINED 
THEY PROBABLY LOP IT ON A REGULAR BASIS 
YES WELL RIGHT 
THEY SEEM TO BE ON A SLOW SIMMER SHALL WE SEE IF WE CAN GET THEM BOILING 
SUE WHEN YOU FIRST SAW THIS PARK HOME YOU SAID IT LOOKED OLD HOW OLD WERE YOU THINKING 
M. M. M. TWENTY YEARS TWENTY YEARS IT'S ACTUALLY ONLY TEN YEARS OLD 
REALLY YES 
IT COULD LAST ANOTHER THIRTY TO FORTY YEARS THEY HAVE A FIFTY YEAR LIFESPAN BUT ONLY IF THEY'RE LOOKED AFTER YES 
NOW WHY DID YOU THINK IT WAS PROBABLY TWENTY YEARS OLD WELL ER 
I DON'T THINK SQUINTING AT THE DECOR THE DECOR DOES IT NO FAVOURS 
IT'S JUST DATED PERHAPS AND IT'S IT IS 
VERY DATED I THINK IF YOU TOOK THIS PLACE AND THREW MAYBE TEN THOUSAND AT IT 
COMPLETELY GUT IT NEW KITCHEN NEW BATHROOM GET OUT THOSE WARDROBES 
OH YES DEFINITELY THEY HAVE SEEN BETTER DAYS HAVEN'T THEY M. M. M. 
PAINT IT A NICE LIGHT BRIGHT COLOUR MODERNISE THE WHOLE THING AND IT WOULD FEEL MUCH LARGER 
AND BECAUSE YOU'RE MAINTAINING IT IT WILL LAST LONGER YES AND BE MORE DESIRABLE 
IF YOU DID ALL THAT LIGHTENED IT BRIGHTENED IT MADE IT FABULOUS AND ABSOLUTELY TO YOUR TASTE 
DO YOU THINK YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN THIS 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS TINY 
BIT TOO SMALL M. M. M. 
LET'S GO AND GUESS THE PRICE ANYWAY SUE RIGHT O. K. 
ONE PROBLEM IF YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE DOWN TO SOMETHING LIKE A PARK HOME

YOU CAN DO VERANDAS ROUND PARK HOMES 
HAVE YOU SEEN THOSE YES I HAVE DECKING STYLE THINGS IF YOU RAN ONE 
RIGHT ALONG THE FRONT YOU'VE GOT A PATIO DOOR LOVELY SEATED AREA TO TAKE YOU OUT TO THAT VIEW YES

I MEAN SHALL I GET MY COAT YEAH 
NICE ADEQUATE ISN'T IT YOU DON'T WANT MUCH MORE IT IS IT'S LOVELY 
YEAH YEAH VERY NICE 
VERY NICE YEAH 
SARAH YES HEADPHONES OFF YES GOT YOUR PEN READY YES COS THEY'RE GONNA SIGN NOW 
YOU BOTH COMMENTED ON THE FANTASTIC VIEW FROM THIS PROPERTY OF COURSE 
THIS IS THE GUY'S LAND HE'S PLONKED IT ON HERE SO THE VIEW IS AS GOOD AS WHERE YOUR LAND IS 
AND YOUR CHOICES REALLY FOR BUYING SOMETHING LIKE THIS ARE 
EITHER YOU GET A PLOT OF LAND 
OF COURSE YOU'VE GOT TO BUY THE LAND AND THEN GET YOUR SERVICES IN TO IT 
YOUR PLUMBING AND ELECTRICITY 
THE OTHER OPTION IS TO USE THIS UNIT ON ONE OF THE RESIDENTIAL PARKS 
IF YOU WENT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHICH OPTION WOULD YOU GO ON WELL OBVIOUSLY 
IF WE GO FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS WE'VE GOT TO DO OUR HOMEWORK 
AND FIND OUT THE COST OF WHICHEVER PARK WILL ACCEPT US SO YOU'D GO FOR PARK 
I THINK WE'D GO FOR A PARK ER 
ALL THE FACILITIES ARE MAINLY THERE 
IT'S JUST A CASE OF CONNECTING UP ONE OF THE CRUCIAL THINGS YOU WANTED 
WAS LOW MAINTENANCE GET SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO THE GARDEN EXACTLY 
SO AT THE MOMENT WE'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT THIS UNIT ON ITS OWN 
TO GUESS THE PRICE LET'S FIND THE GIRLS YES 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE SPACE IN HERE THE LAYOUT I LIKE THE LIVING ROOM PLENTY OF SPACE 
THE KITCHEN'S GOOD MM HMM THE ONLY THING I'M A LITTLE BIT WORRIED ABOUT 
IS THE MASTER BEDROOM RIGHT WHY YOU CANNOT GET ALL THE WAY ROUND THE BED 
IT'S PUSHED UP AGAINST THE WALL WHICH IS NOT VERY GOOD 
YOU'D LIKE A BIGGER MASTER BEDROOM M. M. M. GOOD NEWS 
YOU CAN HAVE ONE OOH THESE LODGES INSIDE YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE THEY COME IN A FAIRLY STANDARD SIZE 
THIS ONE IS THIRTY SIX LONG BY NINETEEN WIDE AND THAT'S FAIRLY STANDARD 
INTERNALLY YOU CAN MOVE THE WALLS WHERE YOU WANT THEM 
IF YOU WANT A BIGGER LIVING ROOM PUSH THE WALL OUT 
WANT A BIGGER BEDROOM PUSH IT OUT EXCELLENT AND IT'S ALL IN THE PRICE 
YOU CAN INTERIOR DESIGN THE LAYOUT OF YOUR HOUSE FOR FREE REALLY 
THAT'S FANTASTIC YEAH 
I THINK YOU'VE GOT A NICE FEELING ABOUT THIS PLACE IT'S COSY AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY WHAT YOU MAKE IT YOURSELF 
HAVE YOU GOT ANY IDEA AT ALL HOW MUCH ONE OF THESE LODGES MIGHT COST 
NO SUE YOU'D BETTER GET AN IDEA COS IT'S TIME TO GET A PRICE RIGHT O. K. 
SO IF THE LODGE IS FOR SUE AND PETE THEY NEED TO BEAR IN MIND 
THAT PEOPLE USUALLY BUY THEIR HOME THROUGH THE RESIDENTIAL PARK THAT THEY WANT TO LIVE IN 
BUT IF THEY CHOOSE TO BUY IT SEPARATELY 
THEY WOULD NEED TO BUDGET FOR 
TO PUT IN THEIR DESIRED SPOT 
IT'S TIME TO GUESS THE PRICE OF SIMON'S MARVELLOUS LODGE 
AND REMEMBER THIS PRICE IS JUST FOR THE LODGE ITSELF NOT INCLUDING THE PLOT OF LAND 
SO PETER HOW MUCH IS IT 
THIS IS GONNA BE A HARD ONE I KNOW 
YOU'RE PLAYING FOR PRIDE HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE TWO TO ZERO DOWN 
NOBODY SAID IT WAS GONNA BE EASY CERTAINLY ISN'T 
EH I'LL GO FOR NINETY FIVE THOUSAND THEN 
NINETY FIVE RIGHTO SUE 
NINETY EIGHT THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
YOU KNOW I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU THINK THAT I WOULD MAKE A YORKSHIREMAN SPEND THAT MUCH MONEY 
THIS IS ASSEMBLED 
WITH YOUR INTERIOR DESIGN THROWN IN FORTY FIVE THOUSAND 
YOU'RE JOKING 
THAT'S BROUGHT A SMILE TO YOUR FACE HASN'T IT CERTAINLY HAS YEAH 
THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD COST YOU WITH YOUR INTERIOR DESIGN THROWN IN FORTY FIVE GRAND 
THAT'S IT THE THREE PROPERTIES 
YOU NOW HAVE TO DECIDE WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO TEST DRIVE 
AND TO AID YOU IN YOUR TRICKY DECISION WE'VE DONE YOU A BIG FAVOUR 
WE'VE TAKEN PICTURES OF ALL THE ROOMS IN ALL THE PROPERTIES 
AND YOU CAN LOOK THROUGH THAT LOT AND MAKE SURE YOU MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION 
SO WHO IS TECHNICAL MAINE DO I GET TO KEEP IT NO WE'D LIKE IT BACK 
FIND SOMEWHERE TO GO THROUGH THAT LOT AND WE'LL SEE YOU LATER OKEY DOKEY THANK YOU 
AND WHILE PETER AND SUE LOOK THROUGH THE THREE PROPERTIES HERE'S A REMINDER 
SO WHICH ONE WILL THEY GO FOR 
WILL IT BE PROPERTY NUMBER ONE WITH IT'S CONSERVATORY AND FANTASTIC VIEWS 
THERE'D BE PLENTY OF MONEY LEFT FOR THEIR RETIREMENT POT AS IT'S ONLY 
OR WILL THEY GO FOR MY CHOICE ONLY NINE MONTHS OLD THEY COULD WALK INTO THIS TWO BEDROOMED PARK HOME FOR 
BUT HOW ABOUT MY WILD CARD THE LODGE MADE TO THEIR OWN SPEC 
SUE AND PETER HAVE TO GIVE IT SERIOUS THOUGHT AT JUST 
NUMBER ONE WE WENT TO NUMBER ONE 
THAT WAS TINY YEAH IT WAS A BIT SMALL 
RIP IT OUT AND PUT A NEW SUITE IN WANTS A NEW SUITE AS YOU SAY 
NOT BAD STORAGE NEEDS MODERNISING 
YEAH I THINK THE BOX ROOM IS TINY TINY 
THE KITCHEN I THINK WE'D REALLY NEED TO RENEW THAT 
RIP IT OUT AND PUT NEW UNITS IN I THINK YEAH I THINK SO YEAH 
TINY AND AGAIN IT JUST WANTS UPDATING DOESN'T IT REDECORATING 
MODERNISING YEAH NICE VIEW THOUGH NICE VIEWS WEREN'T THERE NICE VIEW 
THIS WAS NUMBER TWO NUMBER TWO

BEDROOM THAT WAS THAT BACK BEDROOM SMALL BEDROOM

GUEST BEDROOM ADEQUATE YEAH YEAH 
MASTER BEDROOM JUST A LITTLE BIT SMALL 
I THINK THAT'S IT YEAH HAVE WE MADE A DECISION DO YOU THINK I THINK SO 
SIMON AND I HAD AN INKLING WHICH PROPERTY YOU MIGHT CHOOSE TO TEST DRIVE 
AND YOU DIDN'T DISAPPOINT YOU'VE GONE FOR PROPERTY NUMBER THREE 
THE WILD CARD SIMON'S FABULOUS LODGE 
NOW AT THE BEGINNING YOU SAID YOU WANTED A PARK HOME SO WHY THE LODGE 
WELL FELL IN LOVE WITH IT REALLY SOON AS WE SAW IT 
EH PLUS ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE ROOMS ARE A BIT SMALL ESPECIALLY THE BEDROOM 
IT WAS THAT PERSONAL TAILORING THAT APPEALED YES YES 
IT IS EXCITING ISN'T IT IT'S AN EXCITING PROPOSITION YES 
YOU'RE DESPERATE TO START YOUR TEST DRIVE BUT BEFORE YOU DO 
WE'VE HAD THE SURVEYOR GIVE THE PLACE THE ONCE OVER 
IT'S NOT A FULL SURVEY OR LEGALLY BINDING IT'S JUST POINTERS FOR YOU 
HE'S FOUND TWO THINGS ONE EXTERNAL ONE INTERNAL 
IF YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE SUE OFF LET'S GET OUT OF THE WIND RIGHT 
WHAT HE'S FLAGGED UP EXTERNALLY 
IS YOU NEED TO CHECK WITH THE MANUFACTURER HOW LONG THEY THINK THE PROPERTIES ARE EXPECTED TO LAST 
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO DO ANY MAINTENANCE 
BUT HE SAID MAKE SURE THAT YOU TREAT THE WOOD ON THE OUTSIDE ON A REGULAR BASIS 
AND THAT'S GOING TO IMPROVE THE LIFE EXPECTANCY BUT APART FROM THAT IT'S FINE 
SO YOU YOUNG MAN GO AND JOIN YOUR WIFE AND ENJOY YOUR TEST DRIVE RIGHT 
SUE THERE'S ONE IMPORTANT THING YOU NEED TO CHECK 
AND THAT'S THE SPEC IT'S BUILT TO 
SOMETIMES THEY'RE USED AS HOLIDAY HOMES 
AND THAT'S NOT THE SAME IF IT'S A DOMESTIC RESIDENCE O. K. 
IF IT'S A PERMANENT RESIDENCE IT HAS TO COMPLY TO BUILDING REGULATIONS 
DOES THAT MEAN LIKE SAFETY GLASS IN THE WINDOWS THAT'S EXACTLY IT 
THE GLASS AND WINDOWS FIRE ALARM SMOKE ALARM INSULATION ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF 
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO CHECK WITH THE MANUFACTURER YEAH 
BUT OTHER THAN THAT NOTHING ELSE TO SAY ABOUT IT NO 
SIMON AND I ARE GONNA GET OF YOUR HAIR AND WE'LL SEE YOU LATER 
ENJOY THE TEST DRIVE THANK YOU 
SO PETER MAKES A FEW FURTHER CHECKS AND HAS A BIT OF A RUMMAGE OUTSIDE 
SUE GETS THE FRYING PAN GOING 
AND PUTS SOME BACON ON FOR A BIT OF AN AFTERNOON SNACK 
SOMETHING TELLS ME PETER IS GETTING PECKISH HE HEADS IN TO GIVE SUE A HAND 
ACTUALLY TO SEE IF THAT BACON'S COOKED YET 
NO BUT THEY WON'T BE LONG 
THAT'S THE STUFF PETE GET THE KETTLE ON 
RIGHT I'LL TAKE THEM IN O. K. PETE 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT SARAH THOSE BACON BUTTIES LOOK GOOD 
WE SHOULD'VE HUNG AROUND A WHILE WHILE THEY WERE DOING THE TEST DRIVE 
I DON'T KNOW ALWAYS THINKING OF YOUR STOMACH SIMON 
WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S BEEN FOR YOU TWO BUT THIS IS SO COSY 
HOW'S IT BEEN IT'S BEEN SMASHIN' WE'VE HAD A REALLY GOOD AFTERNOON FANTASTIC 
WE'VE HAD A GOOD LOOK ROUND YEAH REALLY REALLY GOOD LOOK YES YEAH 
YOU SEEM REALLY HAPPY AND YOU LOVED IT BEFORE THE TEST DRIVE 
AND IT'S BEEN MORE THAN YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SO ARE YOU GONNA BARTER OR SCARPER 
WELL IT'S NEITHER REALLY RIGHT 
WE AREN'T GOING TO SCARPER WE AREN'T GOING TO BARTER 
BUT WE ARE GOING TO DIG INTO IT 
WE ARE GOING TO LOOK INTO IT SERIOUSLY THERE'S MORE INFORMATION WE NEED 
TO ACQUIRE BEFORE IT'S NOT AS STRAIGHTFORWARD AS YOU THOUGHT NO 
THE PROBLEM IS THE PROPERTY ITSELF IS FINE IT'S ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL STUNNING YEAH 
IT'S JUST FINDING SOMEWHERE NOW IT'S THAT PLOT OF LAND ISN'T IT YES YES
