IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT MAKES IT GO 
YOU CAN WORK IT OUT IF YOU JUST LEARN ABOUT 
THE WAY THINGS WORK 
IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW IT CAN RIDE OR BUMP AND JUMP 
OR GLIDE AND SLIDE YOU WANNA TAKE A LITTLE LOOK INSIDE 
THE WAY THINGS WORK 
AND WATCH THE THINGUMABOB THAT TURNS THE KNOB 
THAT MAKES THE JIGGER JIG 
THAT TURNS THE THINGUMAJIG THAT MAKES THE DIGGER DIG 
IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW IT CAN FLY 
WITHOUT A WING OR STRING TO TIE WITH 
YOU FIND THE SAME SIMPLE RULES APPLY WITH 
THE WAY THINGS WORK 
DAD 
LOOK THERE'S GOING TO BE A HEAVIEST MAMMOTH COMPETITION 
CAN WE ENTER IT I DON'T SEE WHY NOT 
WE DO HAVE SOME BIG MAMMOTHS 
MIGHT EVEN WIN IT YEAH BUT THEY'RE ALL FILTHY FRANK 
WELL THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO GROOM THEM PILBEAM 
WHEE WHEE 
HOW DO WE FIND THE HEAVIEST MAMMOTH THEN PILBEAM WEIGH THEM 
OW UH OW UH OW 
OW 
WE WON'T GET THEM MAMMOTHS WEIGHED BY WATCHING KIDS ON A SEESAW 
ACTUALLY YOU KNOW OLIVE A SEESAW COULD PROVIDE THE ANSWER 
LOOK HERE 
THE TREE TRUNK ACTS AS A LEVER IT TILTS ON A PIVOT OR FULCRUM 
SO IF YOU PUSH DOWN ON ONE END UP GOES THE OTHER 
HOW COULD WE USE THE SEESAW TO WEIGH THE MAMMOTHS 
A SEESAW TO WEIGH MAMMOTHS 
I HARDLY THINK SO 
WHY NOT TRY IT OLIVE O. K. LET'S HAVE A GO 
AND SO A TEAM OF HELPERS WAS GATHERED TO ASSIST OLIVE 
WHILE THE OTHERS WENT TO ROUND UP THE MAMMOTHS' 
O. K. UNCLE PILBEAM BRING ON THE FIRST ONE 
COME ON YOU GREAT HAIRY THING GET UP THERE 
YOU HAVE TO BE NICER THAN THAT TO THE MAMMOTHS 
AAARGH 
WE COULD PUT HIM ON BACKWARDS SO HE CAN'T SEE WHERE HE'S GOING 
YOU MUST BE JOKING 
WELL WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT 
ME APART FROM YOU TROY 
HUH YOU NEVER TAKE ME SERIOUSLY DAD 
I WOULD IF YOU SAID SOMETHING SERIOUS OH UNCLE PILBEAM 
YOU MUST BE NICER TO PEOPLE 
OH ALL RIGHT SORRY TROY 
LET'S TRY PUTTING PEOPLE ON THE OTHER END UNTIL IT BALANCES 
WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE THAN THAT COME ON THEN YOU TWO 
THE ISLANDERS DISCOVERED THAT THEIR SEESAW BALANCED WHEN THE LOAD 
IN THIS CASE THE WEIGHT OF THE MAMMOTH 
AND THE EFFORT THE WEIGHT OF TEN PEOPLE WERE EQUAL 
IT'LL TAKE ALL DAY TO WEIGH THAT LOT 
AAARGH 
WELL THAT'S THAT THEN WE MIGHT AS WELL PACK IT IN 
NO WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUR PRIZE MAMMOTH 
IF IT'S THE LAST THING YOU DO BUT HOW THERE'S ONLY FOUR OF US 
MAYBE IF WE TRY MOVING THE BOULDER NEARER TO THE MAMMOTH HEY 
HOW WOULD THAT HELP 
IT MIGHT MEAN WE NEED FEWER PEOPLE TO BALANCE THE MAMMOTH 
CAN'T HURT TO TRY 
IT STILL DOESN'T BALANCE 
I'LL HELP WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN THERE ARE MAMMOTHS TO BE WEIGHED 
NICE MAMMOTH JUST SQUEEZE PAST YOU NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT 
IT WORKED WE'RE BALANCED 
HEY 
WHAT THE ISLANDERS DISCOVERED WAS 
THAT IF THE EFFORT IS TWICE AS FAR FROM THE FULCRUM AS THE LOAD 
THEN HALF THE EFFORT IS REQUIRED TO LIFT THE LOAD IN OTHER WORDS 
IT NEEDED FIVE ISLANDERS INSTEAD OF TEN TO BALANCE THE MAMMOTH 
IT'S CALLED A FIRST CLASS LEVER 
THERE ARE THREE CLASSES OF LEVER IN ALL THE FIRST CLASS LEVER ALWAYS 
HAS THE FULCRUM PLACED BETWEEN THE LOAD AND THE EFFORT 
AS WITH THESE SCALES WHEN THE FULCRUM IS CLOSER TO THE LOAD 
THAN TO THE EFFORT THE EFFORT IS MAGNIFIED TO BALANCE 
OR OVERCOME A LARGER LOAD AS WITH THE SEESAW 
OR WITH A NAIL EXTRACTOR LIKE THIS 
WHERE THE EFFORT OF THE HAND IS MAGNIFIED TO PULL OUT A NAIL 
WE'VE WEIGHED EVERY SINGLE MAMMOTH 
AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE FIRST ONE WAS THE HEAVIEST 
WE HAVE TO GET HIM READY 
WE'VE NOT GOT MUCH TIME LEFT THE COMPETITION'S TOMORROW 
I KNOW AND WE STILL HAVE TO SMARTEN HIM UP 
I SUPPOSE THE FIRST THING TO DO IS GET HIM OFF THAT STINKING OLD MAT 
HOW DO WE DO THAT MAMMOTHS ARE ATTACHED TO THEIR SLEEPING MATS 
WE'LL LEVER HIM UP WITH TREE TRUNKS 
AND BRENDA CAN PULL THE MAT FROM UNDER HIM 
WHY DO I HAVE TO PULL OUT THE MAT SH H. 
BECAUSE WE'RE LEVERING HIM UP OF COURSE 
OH ALL RIGHT 
O. K. QUIETLY DOES IT 
CAREFUL THERE 
NEARLY GOT IT 
THERE WE GO QUICKLY BRENDA 
OH H. 
I GET ALL THE NASTY JOBS ROUND HERE 
THE TREE TRUNKS THE ISLANDERS 
WERE USING TO SHIFT THE MAMMOTH WERE ACTING AS SECOND CLASS LEVERS' 
SECOND CLASS LEVERS ALWAYS HAVE THE FULCRUM AT ONE END 
THE EFFORT AT THE OTHER END AND THE LOAD IN BETWEEN 
THE EFFORT MUST BE MOVED FURTHER THAN THE LOAD 
IN THIS CASE BECAUSE THE ISLANDERS WERE THREE TIMES AS FAR 
FROM THE FULCRUM AS THE MAMMOTH THE FORCE NEEDED IS ONLY A THIRD AS MUCH 
AS IF THEY TRIED LIFTING A MAMMOTH BY HAND 
TROLLEYS AND WHEELBARROWS ARE GOOD LEVERS 
BOTH CARRYING LOADS FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER 
ALTHOUGH THEY ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEVERS 
THE TROLLEY IS A FIRST CLASS LEVER 
BECAUSE THE FULCRUM IS BETWEEN THE LOAD AND THE EFFORT 
SO TIPPING THE HANDLE WITH A LIGHT EFFORT RAISES A HEAVY LOAD 
THE WHEELBARROW ON THE OTHER HAND IS A SECOND CLASS LEVER 
BECAUSE THE LOAD IS IN BETWEEN THE FULCRUM AND THE EFFORT 
UH LIFTING THE HANDLES WITH A LIGHT EFFORT RAISES A HEAVY LOAD 
NEARER THE WHEEL AND THE LONGER THE HANDLES 
THE EASIER IT IS TO LIFT THE LOAD 
BETTER GET STARTED THEN CAREFUL NOT TO WAKE HIM UP 
AS LONG AS HE'S NOT MOVED HE'LL SLEEP THROUGH ANYTHING 
EXCEPT NAIL CLIPPING BY THE LOOK OF IT LOOK OUT 
H. M. M. LOOKS LIKE THE MAMMOTH HAS BECOME 
A GIANT THIRD CLASS LEVER WITH THE LOAD AT ONE END 
THE FULCRUM AT THE OTHER END AND THE EFFORT IN BETWEEN 
HERE THE LOAD MOVES THREE TIMES AS FAR AS THE EFFORT 
AND THREE TIMES AS FAST 
BECAUSE IT IS THREE TIMES AS FAR FROM THE FULCRUM 
ALTHOUGH NOT NEARLY AS FAST AS US GETTING OUT OF ITS WAY 
A THIRD CLASS LEVER ALWAYS MAGNIFIES THE SPEED AND THE DISTANCE MOVED 
BUT REDUCES THE FORCE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN USING A HAMMER 
THE HAND SUPPLIES THE EFFORT TO SPEED UP THE HEAD 
THE WRIST IS THE FULCRUM AND THE LOAD IS THE RESISTANCE OF THE WOOD 
THE HAMMER HEAD MOVES FASTER THAN THE HAND TO STRIKE THE NAIL 
FINALLY THE MAMMOTH MANICURE WAS ALL DONE 
RIGHT COME ON THEN OR WE'LL MISS THE SHOW 
COME ON OLD BOY 
NOW THAT'S HOW TO WEIGH A MAMMOTH 
USING A FIRST CLASS LEVER 
IT IS MY OFFICIAL DUTY TO INFORM YOU 
THAT YOUR MAMMOTH WON THE COMPETITION 
AND NOW ALL THAT REMAINS IS FOR YOU AND YOUR MAMMOTH 
TO GET ON THE PODIUM AND COLLECT YOUR PRIZE 
WHAT THAT PODIUM UP THERE 
THAT IS CORRECT YES 
HOW ARE WE GONNA GET A GREAT BIG H. 
H. HANDSOME MAMMOTH ALL THE WAY UP THERE 
THAT'S EASY ISN'T IT GUYS YEAH 
WELL CONGRATULATIONS ALL OF YOU 
JUST GOES TO SHOW WHAT CAN BE ACHIEVED WITH A FEW SIMPLE LEVERS 
HOORAY 
HERE'S A PRIZE FOR ALL YOUR FRIENDS 
YOU AND YOUR LEVERS HUH 
MY NAME'S SERENA COWDY AND I WROTE THIS POEM WHEN I WAS ELEVEN 
IT'S CALLED EXCUSES EXCUSES 
I WROTE THIS POEM BECAUSE I'VE HEARD SO MANY DIFFERENT EXCUSES 
FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE I DECIDED TO GET SOME DOWN ON PAPER 
THIS POEM TOOK ME THIRTY FIVE MINUTES TO THINK OF 
AND ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO WRITE DOWN 
IT USUALLY WORKS LIKE THAT 
I USUALLY END UP WRITING IT DOWN VERY QUICKLY 
WELL YOU SEE SIR THE REASON I'M LATE SIR 
IS BECAUSE 
MY MAM FELL DOWN THE STAIRS AND SQUASHED OUR DOG 
GRAN TOOK A FUNNY TURN 
WHEN SHE SAW WHAT MAM DID TO THE CHEESE PLANT WHEN SHE FELL 
SO AN AMBULANCE CAME AND TOOK OUR GRAN AWAY 
AND BY THIS TIME I'D MISSED THE BUS WHAT WITH ALL THE EXCITEMENT 
AND WHEN THE NEXT CAME THERE WAS ONLY ONE PLACE LEFT 
SO I WAS KIND LIKE YOU TELL ME TO BE SIR 
AND LET OLD MRS. BRIGGS ON FIRST 
SO THEN I HAD TO WALK 
WHICH TOOK ABOUT THREE YEARS SIR 
SO YOU SEE SIR 
I DIDN'T GO TO NATALIE WILSON'S VALENTINES PARTY AND THEN OVERSLEEP 
JUST IN CASE YOU THOUGHT I HAD
