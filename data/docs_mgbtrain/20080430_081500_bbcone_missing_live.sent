ENDS IN MYSTERY FOR JAMES AND HIS 
FRIENDS AND FAMILY 
JAMES GREW UP IN COLDICOTT 
MONMOUTHSHIRE WITH HIS MUM DAD AND 
SISTER AS A CHILD HE DEVELOPED A 
SPORTING PASSION THAT BECOMES THE 
CENTRE OF HIS LIFE

GOLF HE LOVED GOLF CLUPS 
ESPECIALLY HE KNEW WHAT WAS RIGHT 
AND WRONG HE WAS THE JUNIOR 
CAPTAIN AND THE GWENT COUNTY 
CAPTAIN 
HE DIDN'T WANT TO STAY ON CAPTAIN AT SCHOOL HE JUST WANTED TO PLAY 
GOLF EVERY JOB HE HAD WAS CENTRED 
AROUND GOLF 
JAMES SHARED HIS EARLY 
PASSION WITH HIS THREE CLOSEST 
FRIENDS 
I'VE KNOWN JAMES SINCE HE FRIENDS WAS NINE AND I WAS TWELVE WE STARTED 
PLAYING JUNIOR GOLF TOGETHER AND 
BECAME REALLY CLOSE FRIENDS HE'S 
JUST A REALLY REALLY FRIENDLY 
GENTLE GIANT A GREAT GUY WE'D WE'D HAVE A MATCH EVERY WEEK AT LEAST 
AND THEN HE'D PLAY GOLF EVERY 
WEEKEND AND IN THE SUMMER TIME IT 
WAS THREE OR FOUR TIMES A WEEK 
PROBABLY 
AS A FRIEND HE WAS THE PROBABLY SORT OF PERSON THAT IF YOU HAD A 
PROBLEM YOU'D GO TO HIM AND HAVE A 
CHAT HE'D DO ANYTHING FOR YOU HE 
EVEN LENT ME HIS CAR WHEN I DIDN'T 
HAVE ONE HE WAS A REALLY NICE GUY 
IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND FOUR JAMES AND A GROUP 
OF GOLFING FRIENDS BOOK HOLIDAY

TOUR WE HAVE A GREAT COUPLE OF 
DAYS A LOT OF DRINKING AND GOOD 
FUN AND GOOD GOLF AS WELL WE WERE 
ALL IN GOOD MOODS EVERYONE WAS 
TALKING ABOUT IT AND WE COULDN'T 
WAIT TO GET THERE 
WHEN THE DAY FINALLY ARRIVES THE 
BOYS PACK THEIR BAGS AND GOLF CLUBS 
THEY'RE READY FOR THEIR HOLIDAY 
ON THAT DAY I PICKED HIM UP FROM 
HIS HOUSE ABOUT THREE P. M. ON THE SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON THERE WERE FOUR OF US IN 
THE CAR MYSELF SIMON ROB AND 
JAMES JAMES THE THING I ALWAYS REMEMBER IS THAT 
HE DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE L. KNOW HIS 
FATHER WENT AFTER HIM AND SAID 
SOMETHING TO HIM ABOUT PICKING HIM 
UP IF HE NEEDED TO COME AWAY EARLY 
AND JEFFREY SAID HE DID SAY 
SOMETHING LIKE MIGHT NOT BE BACK 
AND OF COURSE YOU DON'T REALISE 
AT THE TIME WHAT THOSE WORDS MEANT 
THE BOYS SET OFF FOR TENBY THE 
TWO HOUR JOURNEY IS DIFFICULT IN 
HEAVY RAIN AT FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THAT AFTERNOON 
THEY'RE CAPTURED ON C. C. T. V. ARRIVING 
AT THIS TOWN AND BY NOW THE COASTAL 
WINDS ARE REACHING GALE FORCE I I CAN REMEMBER WHEN HE PARKED OUTSIDE 
THE HOTEL AT TENBY AND OPENED THE 
CAR DOOR IT NEARLY BLEW OFF THE 
HINGES IT WAS A REALLY REALLY 
ROUGH NIGHT RATHER THAN WALKING 
DOWN THE FRONT WE WENT DOWN THE 
BACK PAST THE BOWLING GREEN IT 
WAS REALLY REALLY WINDY WITH HEAVY 
SHOWERS IT WAS A ROUGH NIGHT 
JAMES AND HIS FRIENDS MAKE THEIR 
WAY TO THE GILTAR HOTEL LOCATED ON 
THE CLIFF TOPS ALONG THE BEACH WE WE CHECKED IN AND JAMES WANTED TO 
UNPACK ALL HIS CLOTHES AND HANG 
THEM UP BECAUSE HE WAS LIKE THAT 
HE WANTED ALL HIS STUFF SORTED BUT 
EVERYONE ELSE WANTED TO JUST 
LITERALLY THROW THE BAGS IN AND GO 
OUT AND GET SOMETHING TO EAT THE THE GROUP IS AGAIN CAPTURED ON C. C. T. V. 
HEADING AWAY FROM THE HOTEL FOR THE 
NIGHT OUT 
WE WENT TO THE THREE 
MARINERS AND MYSELF AND JAMES DID 
KARAOKE KARAOKE WE LEFT THAT PUB AND WENT TO 
ANOTHER PUB AND MET A FEW OF THE 
OTHER GUYS BECAUSE THERE WAS QUITE 
A BIG GROUP OF US 
ELEVEN THIRTY P. M. AND THE 
BOYS ARE MAKING THEIR WAY TO THE 
PRINCE OF WALES PUB DISCO JAMES'S 
DISTINCTIVE WHITE ZIP UP TOP IS 
CLEARLY VISIBLE 
I REMEMBER SEEING 
JAMES IN THERE TALKING TO HIM AND 
WALKING BACK AND FORTH TO THE BAR 
HE SEEMED FINE 
JUST BEFORE 
MIDNIGHT JAMES DECIDES TO HEAD 
BACK TO THE HOTEL ALONE 
ALTHOUGH HE 
I WENT BACK TO MY ROOM AND JAMES 
WASN'T THERE SO I STARTED PHONING 
HIM IT WAS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO A M. AND I LET 
THE PHONE RING AND THE LAST TIME I 
PHONED IT WAS DEAD L. DIDN'T THINK 
SOMETHING REALLY BAD WAS HAPPENING 
I JUST THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE WITHIN 
ASLEEP AND WHEN THE PHONE WAS 
RINGING HE JUST TURNED IT OFF 
SIMON GOES TO BED ASSUMING THAT HIS 
ROOMMATE HAS FALLEN A SLEEP IN 
ANOTHER ROOM AND THEY'LL MEET UP 
THE NEXT MORNING 
WHEN WE GOT UP 
THE FOLLOWING DAY WE WERE STAYING 
IN TWO SEPARATE HOTELS SO WE WENT 
DOWN FOR BREAKFAST AND THE GUY THAT 
JAMES WAS SHARING A ROOM WITH CAME 
DOWN ON HIS OWN AND SAID HAS 
ANYONE SEEN JAMES 
WE STARTED TO 
PHONE AROUND THE OTHERS TO CHECK 
THAT HE WAS NOT WITH HIM AND WE 
THOUGHT HE WAS BOUND TO BE WITH HIM 
AND WHEN THEY SAID NO WE THOUGHT 
THEY WERE JOKING 
AT TEN A M. STILL 
BELIEVING THAT JAMES IS WITH THE 
OTHER GROUP HIS FRIENDS HEAD OFF 
TO PLAY GOLF 
THEY RETURN TO THE CLUBHOUSE AT THREE P. M. 
EXPECTING TO FIND HIM THERE 
I'D JUST ASSUMED HE'D BE IN THE BAR 
OBVIOUSLY TOO HUNGOVER TO PLAY GOLF 
OR JUST ASLEEP IN THE GOLF CLUB 
BUT WHEN WE GOT BACK HE WASN'T 
THERE AND THAT WAS THE STOMACH 
TURNING POINT THEN

JAMES NUTLEY IS TWENTY FIVE HE IS FROM

ON OCTOBER TWENTY FOURTH TWO THOUSAND FOUR HE TRAVELS TO 
TENBY WITH GLOEP OF FRIEND ON A 
GOLFING HOLIDAY AFTER SPENDING THE 
EVENING WITH THEM IN SOME LOCAL 
PUBS HE LEAVES ALONE AT MIDNIGHT TO 
WALK BACK TO HIS HOTEL THE NEXT 
DAY HE IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN HIS 
FRIENDS REPORT HIM MISSING 
STRAIGHT TO THE POLICE STATION 
TOLD HIM LOOK HE IS MISSING WE 
HAVE VERY CONCERNED AND WE JUST 
ALL GOT INTO OUR LITTLE GROUPS AND 
DID OUR OWN SEARCHES ROUND THE 
BEACHES ROUND THE HOTELS JUST 
HAVING A LOOK ROUND WE WENT ALONG 
THE FRONT WHICH IS BY THE HOTEL 
WENT DOWN THE STEPS BUMPED INTO A 
POLICEMAN THERE AND HE ACTUALLY 
FOUND SOME OF JAMES' CARDS I THINK 
IT WAS LIKE HIS MEMBERSHIP CARD 
GOLF CARD THAT KIND OF THING WHICH 
WERE ALL ON THE BEACH A LITTLE BOY 
HAS FOUND AND HANDED IT TO THE 
POLICE 
WHY ARE JAMES'S BANK CARDS POLICE ON THE BEACH HAS HE BEEN MUGGED OR 
DROPPED HIS WALLET HIS FRIENDS 
CAN'T MAKE SENSE OF IT 
IF WE WERE 
UPSET WHEN HE SHOWED US HIS CARDS 
AND WE KIND OF THOUGHT THE WORST 
THEN 
BUT FINDING THE CARDS DOESN'T THEN GIVE THEM ANY ANSWER THEY STILL 
HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED TO JAMES 
THAT NIGHT 
THE POLICE NEED MORE DEFINITE 
EVIDENCE THEY TURN TO TENBY'S 
NETWORK OF C. C. T. V. CAMERAS 
IN CASES 
LIKE THIS WE STUDY THE C. C. T. V. OF THE 
TOWN CAMERAS AND PUBS AND CLUBS L. 
HAVE GONE THROUGH ALL OF THE C. C. T. V. 
WITH THE FAMILY OR ONE OF MY 
COLLEAGUES HAS AND THEY STUDY THE 
C. C. T. V. OF THE HOTEL TO THE LEFT HERE 
AND THEY ARE OF THE OPINION THEY 
SAW JAMES CROSSING HERE CROSSING 
THE ROAD TOWARD THE ATLANTIC HOTEL 
AND AS YOU CAN SEE THE GILTAR HOTEL 
IS A STONE'S THROW FROM US DESPITE DESPITE THE POOR QUALITY OF THE FOOTAGE 
JAMES' PARENTS ARE CONVINCED THE 
MAN REPORTED AT MIDNIGHT IS THEIR 
SON HE IS WEARING THE DISTINCTIVE 
WHITE TOP HE HAS BEEN SEEN IN 
EARLIER THAT NIGHT BUT IF THIS 
JAMES WHAT HAPPENS TO HIM NEXT 
TWO DAYS LATER THE POLICE DECIDE 
TO CALL IN A SNIFFER DOG TO HELP 
LOOK FOR CLUES 
THE DOG DID PICK UP 
A SCENT FURTHER UP THE ROAD BEHIND 
ME FOLLOW THAT DOWN TOWARDS THIS 
AREA WHERE WE GOT AS FAR AS WHAT 
IS CALLED TO MY LEFT THE DISPLAY 
AND THIS IS WHERE THE SCENT ENDED 
AS YOU CAN SEE THE RAILINGS TAKE US 
TO IT IS QUITE A SHEER DROP THE THE DOGS CANNOT FIND ANY MORE CLUES SO 
THE EMERGENCY SERVICES LAUNCH A 
FULL SCALE SEARCH OF THE AREA WE WE DEPLOYED COASTGUARDS AND USED THEM 
TO SEARCH THIS AREA FROM THIS 
RAILINGS UP AS FAR AS THE HOTEL 
TO THE SORT OF BEACH THE OTHER END 
OF HERE 
IT WAS QUITE A SHOCKING NIGHT L. 
CAN REMEMBER SITTING ON THE SEAT 
OUTSIDE THE HOTEL WATCHING THE 
HELICOPTERS AND THE BOATS AND YOU 
SEE THESE THINGS BUT YOU DON'T 
THINK IT WILL HAPPEN TO SOMEBODY 
THAT YOU WERE WITH 
THE AIR LAND AND SEA OPERATION 
SEARCHES EVERY SQUARE METRE OF THE 
AREA IF JAMES HAS FALLEN OFF THE 
CLIFF TOP NEAR THE HOTEL SOME 
EVIDENCE WILL SURELY BE FOUND BUT 
TWO DAYS LATER THERE ARE NO FURTHER 
CLUES AND THE SEARCH IS CALLED OFF 
HIS FRIENDS HAVE TO MAKE THE 
DIFFICULT DECISION TO LEAVE TENBY 
THEY GO HOME WITHOUT JAMES WHEN WHEN WE GOT IN THE CAR TO LEAVE AND I 
WAS SAT IN THE BACK AGAIN AND 
JAMES WASN'T THERE IT WAS JUST 
AWFUL THE RIDE HOME BECAUSE TWO 
HOURS OF JUST SILENCE REALLY AND 
IT WAS AWFUL 
IN THE WEEKS THAT 
FOLLOW THE EMERGENCY SERVICES 
CONTINUE TO SEARCH BUT THERE ARE 
NO CLUE AND NOTHING LEADS THEM TO 
HIM JAMES HAS BEEN MISSING FOR 
THREE AND A HALF YEARS THERE HAVE 
BEEN NO SIGHTINGS OF HIM SINCE THE 
NIGHT HE DISAPPEARED 
WE HAVE TO 
KEEP AND OPEN MIND THE TRAIL ENDED 
TO THE RIGHT OF US BUT THERE IS NO 
EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT HAPPENED TO 
HIM IN MY ROLE I SPEND A LOT OF 
TIME WITH THE FAMILY SO THERE IS 
HARD EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY THAT 
THEN THEY HAVE TO HOLD U. OUT THE 
BELIEF HE IS ALIVE AND WELL 
FUNDAMENTAL 
THE C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE FUNDAMENTA RAISES THE QUESTION WHERE DID JAMES 
GO NEXT 
HE WASN'T IN THE NIGHTCLUB 
THAT LONG WITH THEM HE WAS ONLY IN 
QUARTER OF AN HOUR BUT IT ONLY TOOK 
HIM TWENTY MINUTES GOING OUT AND 
GETTING BACK TO THE HOTEL DOOR SO 
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM IN THAT THIRTY 
YARDS IS A MYSTERY 
WHAT HAPPENED TO JAMES REALLY IS A 
MYSTERY IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING THAT 
CAN HELP PLEASE CALL MISSING

SIGHTING IN THE SAME AREA ARE THE 
OFFICERS GETTING CLOSER 
THERE IS A CANTEEN PLACE FOR 
HOMELESS GUYS CALLED THE MISSION 
WHICH IS CLOSE TO THE ROYAL LONDON 
HOSPITAL APPARENTLY AND THEY 
THINK THEY'VE SEEN HIM THERE IF IF LUKE IS SLEEPING ROUGH IN LONDON IT

MISSION EVERY DAY FOR MEALS 
IAN GOES STRAIGHT OFF TO MEET THE 
CENTRE MANAGER 
WE'VE SPOKEN TO SOME PEOPLE WHO 
DIRECTED US TO THE PARK AND THEY 
SAY IN THE PARK THAT THEY MIGHT

CLOSER 
IT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'VE CLOSER FOLLOWED UP A SIGHTING AND HAVING 
DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT 
SITUATIONS ALL SAYING THEY 
RECOGNISE THE FACE ON THE PHOTO 
YOU HAVE TO PUT A BIT OF CAUTION ON 
THAT BECAUSE TIME HAS ELAPSED AND 
PEOPLE COULD OVERLAY THE IMAGE IN 
THEIR MEMORY AND STORE THINGS IN 
THEIR MIND BUT DIFFERENT PEOPLE 
ALL SAYING THE SAME THING WITHIN 
THE SAME AREA IS PROMISING 
IF THE YOUNG MAN IN LONDON IS LUKE 
THEN THIS IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT 
DEVELOPMENT IN THE TWO YEAR 
INVESTIGATION 
IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHERE 
LUKE MIGHT BE PLEASE CALL MISSING 
PEOPLE DETECTIVE INSPECTOR ADDISON 
YOU ARE RUNNING THE CASE WHAT DID 
YOU ESTABLISH IN LONDON WELL WELL SEVERAL PEOPLE SAID THEY HAD SEEN
