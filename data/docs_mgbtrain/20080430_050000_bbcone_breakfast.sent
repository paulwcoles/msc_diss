BY PRINCE HARRY IN HELMAND PROVINCE 
HE SPENT THREE HOURS IN KANDAHAR ON 
MONDAY THE PRINCE WHO'S ON 
ATTACHMENT WITH THE R. A. F. FLEW THE 
MILITARY PLANE HIMSELF FOR PART OF 
THE JOURNEY 
WHAT BEGAN IN THE SAFETY OF THE 
ENGLISH SKIES HAS ENDED IN A 
CONFLICT ZONE PRINCE WILLIAM 
STARTED HIS FOUR MONTH ATTACHMENT 
WITH THE R. A. F. IN A TWO SEATER 
TRAINING PLANE NOW HE'S FLYING 
THIS A MILITARY TRANSPORT MORE 
THAN FIFTY METRES LONG THE PRINCE 
LEFT R. A. F. BRIZE NORTON ON SUNDAY 
TAKING TO THE CONTROLS FOR A TIME 
AS HE HEADED FOR KANDAHAR AIRFIELD 
IN SOUTHERN AFGHANISTAN POSSIBLY 
FLYING IN OVER HELMAND PROVINCE 
HIS BROTHER PRINCE HARRY'S TOUR OF 
DUTY THERE WAS CUT SHORT AFTER THE 
BREAK DOWN OF A MEDIA BLACKOUT SO 
IT WAS NO SURPRISE THAT PRINCE 
WILLIAM'S VISIT WAS BOTH 
CONFIDENTIAL AND BRIEF AT KANDAHAR 
AIRFIELD HE SPENT JUST THREE HOURS 
CHATTING TO SERVICE PERSONNEL THE 
VISIT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS 
FAMILIARISING THE PRINCE WITH 
ACTIVE OPERATIONS S. M. ARE MORE 
CYNICAL ABOUT ITS PURPOSE 
IT'S A 
GOOD PUBLIC RELATIONS EXERCISE FOR 
WILLIAM IN VIEW OF THE BAD 
PUBLICITY LAST WEEK WHERE HE WAS 
DROPPING IN ON KATE MIDDLE TON'S 
FAMILY IN AN R. A. F. HELICOPTER BAD 
WEEK LAST WEEK GOOD WEEK NOW NOW NOW HE HAS HIS WINGS PRINCE WILLIAM 
WILL NEXT TAKE TO THE SEA HE'S TO 
JOIN THE NAVY ON SE KONDMENT IN 
JUNE JUNE LET'S JOIN MARK LIVE NOW AT 
CLARENCE HOUSE GOOD MORNING THE 
ROYAL FAMILY TAKING PRINCE 
WILLIAM'S SERVICE IN THE R. A. F. VERY 
SERIOUSLY 
WELL THAT'S RIGHT THE SERIOUSLY ROYAL FAMILY DID WAIT TO MAKE THIS 
PUBLIC THEY WAITED UNTIL WILLIAM 
HAD RETURNED SAFELY IT'S A MEASURE 
OF HOW SERIOUSLY THEY WERE TAKING 
THIS THAT BEFORE WILLIAM TRAVELLED 
HE DID SEEK THE CONSENT OF BOTH THE 
QUEEN AND THE PRINCE OF WALES FROM 
WHAT CLARENCE HOUSE HAVE BEEN 
SAYING THIS WASN'T A P. R. STUNT AT 
ALL THEIR VIEW IS THAT THIS WAS AN 
IMPORTANT PART OF GROOMING WILLIAM 
FOR TAKING OVER AS HEAD OF THE 
ARMED FORCES AT SOME POINT IN THE 
FUTURE IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE 
AREA HE TRAVELLED TO KANDAHAR IS 
NOT WITHOUT ITS DANGERS BOMBS 
THERE ARE COMMON JUST TWO WEEKS 
AGO TWO AIRMEN LOST THEIR LIVES 
WHEN CLARENCE HOUSE HERE SAYS THAT 
IT WAS A SUCCESS WHAT THEY REALLY 
MEAN IS THAT IT WENT OFF WITHOUT A 
HITCH FOR THAT THEY'RE VERY HAPPY 
THANK YOU 
A SUPERMARKET TSAR COULD BE 
APPOINTED TO LIMIT THE POWERS OF 
BIG CHAINS AND PROTECT CONSUMER 
RIGHTS AFTER A TWO YEAR 
INVESTIGATION THE COMPETITION 
COMMISSION SAYS SUPERMARKETS SHOULD 
NOT BE ABLE TO BUILD LOCAL 
MONOPOLIES IT'S CALLED FOR BETTER 
DIALOGUE BETWEEN STORES AND 
SUPPLIERS SUPPLIERS IN BICESTER OXFORDSHIRE THERE ARE 
NO FEWER THAN SIX TESCO'S WITHIN 
JUST OVER A MILE THE LACK OF 
COMPETITION IS ONE REASON THE 
COMPETITION COMMISSION SAYS IT'S 
TIME TO CHANGE THE LAW PLANNERS 
WOULD GET A SAY IN WHICH 
SUPERMARKETS COME TO TOWN 
IT WOULD 
ALLOW US TO LOCK AT AN APPLICATION 
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A 
MONOPOLY SITUATION AND USE THAT AS 
A REASON FOR SAYING WE FELT AN 
APPLICATION SHOULD BE TURNED DOWN 
FOR FARMERS AND SUPPLIERS THE 
COMMISSION WANTS TO SET UP NEW 
OMBUDSMAN TO SETTLE DISPUTES WITH 
SUPERMARKETS SOME CLAIM FARMERS 
HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN TREATED FAIRLY 
ONE BONE OF CONTENTION IS WHEN THEY 
HAVE TO PAY FOR SHELF SPACE TO HAVE 
THE PLEASURE OF PUTTING THEIR 
PRODUCT IN STORE THAT'S TOTALLY 
ANTIQUATED AND UNACCEPTABLE THE THE SUPERMARKETS SAY NEITHER OF THESE 
IDEAS WILL REALLY HELP CONSUMERS 
GIVEN THAT SOME LOCAL MONOPOLIES 
ARE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THE TEST 
FOR THE COMPETITION COMMISSION IS 
WHETHER ITS RECOMMENDATIONS CAN 
MAKE ANY PRACTICAL DIFFERENCE 
A TEENAGE FROM BRISTOL WILL APPEAR 
IN COURT TODAY ACCUSED OF INTENDING 
TO COMMIT ACTS OF TERRORISM NINETEEN 
YEAR OLD ANDREW IBRAHIM WHO HAD 
RECENTLY CONVERTED TO ISLAM WAS 
ARRESTED AT HIS HOME TWO WEEKS AGO 
THREE CONTROLLED EXPLOSIONS WERE 
LATER CARRIED OUT AT HIS FLAT 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS DROPPED PLANS TO 
GIVE PRISONERS IN ENGLAND AND WALES 
A PAY RISE FOR ANY WORK THAT THEY 
DO WHILE THEY'RE IN JAIL THE 
INCREASE FROM FOUR FOR A FIVE DAY 
WEEK TO FIVE POINT FIVE OH WAS TO COME INTO 
EFFECT TOMORROW IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
THE FIRST RISE FOR TEN YEARS 
HUNDREDS PEOPLE HELD A VIGIL IN 
AMSTETTEN TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR THE 
WOMAN WHO WAS IMPRISONED BY HER 
FATHER FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS D. N. A. TESTS HAVE 
CONFIRMED THAT JOSEF FRITZL IS THE 
FATHER OF HIS DAUGHTER'S SIX 
SURVIVING CHILDREN THE SEVENTY THREE YEAR OLD 
HAS BEEN REMANDED IN KUSTDI 
CUSTODY 
UNITED IN HORROR THE PEOPLE OF 
AMSTETTEN IN AUSTRIA CAME TOGETHER 
TO WONDER HOW A YOUNG WOMAN COULD 
BE IMPRISONED UNDERGROUND BY HER 
OWN FATHER FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS BEARING HIM 
SEVEN CHILDREN AND WONDERING HOW 
NO ONE NOT EVEN HER OWN MOTHER 
NOTICED NOTICED 
IT'S TERRIBLE THAT SUCH A THING COULD HAPPEN NEAR US 
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE IT YOU ALWAYS 
THINK IT'S FAR AWAY AND THEN IT 
HAPPENS IN THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR SEVENTY THREE SEVENTY THREE YEAR OLD JOSEF FRITZL COVERED HIS 
FACE AS HE WAS DRIVEN TO THE COURT 
HOUSE YESTERDAY HE'S CONFESSED TO 
IMPRISONING HIS THEN TEENAGE 
DAUGHTER FATHERING HER CHILDREN 
AND OF DISPOSING OF ONE CHILD'S 
BODY HE'S NOW FACING UP TO TWENTY 
YEARS IN PRISON 
WE NEED TO SEE IF THERE'S EVIDENCE OF ANY PSYCHIATRIC 
DISORDER WHICH WILL BE VERY 
IMPORTANT WHEN ASSESSING THE GUILT 
OF THE SUSPECT AND THE EXTENT OF 
THE GUILT DETERMINES THE EXTENT OF 
THE PENALTY 
AT THIS HOSPITAL UNDER THE 
WATCHFUL GAZE OF DOCTORS ELISABETH 
FRITZL WAS REUNITED WITH HER MOTHER 
OFFICIALS SAY DESPITE THE TRAUMATE 
FAMILY'S BEEN THROUGH THE MEETING 
WAS ASTONISHINGLY EASY 
HALF OF THE EASTERN EUROPEAN 
MIGRANTS WHO'VE COME HERE SINCE 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR HAVE ALREADY GONE BACK HOME 
ACCORDING TO NEW RESEARCH THE 
INSTITUTE TORE PUBLIC POLICY 
RESEARCH ALSO CLAIMS A MILLION 
PEOPLE EMIGRATED TO THE U. K. FROM 
EASTERN EUROPE OVER THE LAST FOUR 
YEARS THAT'S ABOUT TEN TIMES MORE 
THAN THE GOVERNMENT HAD ESTIMATED 
GOOD MORNING GRAHAM 
WE'RE IN THE 
MARKET SQUARE IN NORTHAMPTON L. 
SUPPOSE THIS IS A CLASSIC ENGLISH 
MARKET TOWN UP UNTIL FOUR YEARS 
AGO THERE WAS NO IMMIGRATION TO 
SPEAK OF HERE AT ALL TODAY THERE 
ARE FOURTEEN THOUSAND EASTERN EUROPEANS THEY 
MAKE UP ABOUT SEVEN PER CENT OF THE POPULATION 
TODAY'S REPORT BY THE IPPR GIVES US 
THE CLEAREST PICTURE OF THE SCALE 
OF MIGRATION MORE THAN A MILLION 
HAVE COME BUT HALF A MILLION HAVE 
GONE HOME AND FEWER AND FEWER ARE 
COMING EVERY YEAR THAT COULD HAVE 
QUITE AN IMPACT ON ECONOMIES LIKE 
NORTHAMPTON'S UP AND DOWN THE 
COUNTRY 
IT USED TO BE A CURRY COUNTRY HOUSE BUT THESE TWO WOMEN HAVE 
TURNED IT INTO A POLISH RESTAURANT 
ODETA WORKED IN A FACTORY FOR TWO 
YEARS SAVED HER MONEY AND THEN 
OPENED THE RESTAURANT IN JANUARY I I LOVE COOKING I LOVE NORTHAMPTON 
AND I THINK I STAY HERE THOUSANDS THOUSANDS OF POLES ARE PUTTING DOWN ROOTS 
OPENING BUSINESSES STARTING 
FAMILIES BUT TODAY'S REPORT SHOWS 
A COMPLEX PICTURE OF MIGRATION IT 
SAYS THE NUMBERS COMING IS STARTING 
TO SLOW AND MANY POLES HALF A 
MILLION HAVE ALREADY GONE HOME AT 
THIS HAULAGE FIRM WE FOUND JONATHAN 
POLLARD MARLENA POL SHE WORKS 
IN THE OFFICE GIVING INSTRUCTIONS 
TO POLISH DRIVERS BUT SHE HAS NO 
INTENTION OF STAYING 
WHEN I SPEAK 
TO PEOPLE THEY DON'T LIKE TOO MUCH 
ENGLAND IT'S A FOREIGN COUNTRY 
THAT'S WHY THAT'S WHY MOST OF THEM 
THINK COME BACK 
THE FALLING NUMBER 
OF MIGRANTS IS A WORRY FOR LOCAL 
FIRMS 
WE FIND THAT SOME OF THE FIRMS BRITISH PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO DOT 
JOBS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE POLISH 
PEOPLE WE WOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT 
TO FILL SOME OF THOSE JOBS TODAY'S TODAY'S REPORT SAYS AS THE POLES STOP 
COMING THE IMPACT ON SOME SECTORS 
OF THE ECONOMY COULD BE SEVERE 
THERE IS PARTICULAR CONCERN FOR 
CERTAIN SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY 
AGRICULTURE THE HOTEL INDUSTRY 
WAREHOUSE PACKING THIS REPORT 
MAKES A CONCLUSION MOST OF OUR 
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT EASTERN EUROPEAN 
MIGRATION THAT THERE ARE MORE AND 
MORE PEOPLE COMING AND THAT THEY'RE 
ALL GOING TO STAY ARE PROBABLY 
WRONG THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE 
NEED TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT AS WE 
PLAN FOR THE FUTURE ECONOMY 
WE'LL BE GETTING MORE DETAIL ON 
THAT REPORT INTO IMMIGRATION AT 
ABOUT SIX FORTY A M. 
THE TWO SIDES IN THE PENSIONS 
DISPUTE WHICH LED TO A STRIKE AT 
GRANGEMOUTH OIL REFINERY WILL 
CONSIDER A POSSIBLE RESOLUTION 
TODAY THEY DREW UP THE PROPOSAL 
YESTERDAY HOURS AFTER WORKERS AT 
THE PLANT RETURNED FROM A FORTY EIGHT HOUR 
WALKOUT HUNDREDS OF TANKERS WERE 
EXPECTED TO LEAVE THE REFINERY 
TODAY TO RESTORM PETROL STATIONS 
AFTER A WEEK LONG SEARCH THE ROYAL 
NAVY HAS FINALLY TRACKED DOWN AN 
UNEXPLODED WORLD WAR TWO BOMB WHICH 
IT HAD LOST THE ONE THOUSAND POUND 
EXPLOSIVE THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN 
DROPPED BY THE LUFTWAFFE IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO 
WATCHED UP ON THE BEACH IN

EXAMPLE YOU CAN SEE ON THE RADAR 
WHICH GOES BACK TWELVE HOURS 
YESTERDAY'S RAIN MOVING SOUTH WARDS 
A NEW BAND ACROSS THE ENGLISH 
CHANNEL FOR SOME THE RUSH HOUR 
WILL BE TRICKY BY NINE HUNDRED A M. THE RAIN 
BAND WOULD HAVE PUSHED UP ACROSS 
SCOTLAND ONE OR TWO SHOWERS BUT 
BRIGHTER SPELLS AS WELL AS WE HEAD 
SOUTH BY NINE HUNDRED A M. THIS IS WHERE WE 
EXPECT THE RAIN TO BE ACROSS THE 
MIDLANDS AND EAST ANGLIA REMNANTS 
COMING UP ACROSS THE ENGLISH 
CHANNEL INTO THE SOUTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND HERE THERE ARE FURTHER 
SPELLS OF RAIN THAT EXTENDS UP 
INTO PARTS OF RAIN YOU CAN SEE 
WHERE WE EXPECT IT TO BE DRY WITH 
SOME SUNSHINE NORTHERN IRELAND 
DOING WELL TODAY MAYBE THAT RAIN 
CLIPPING THE EAST BUT FOR CENTRAL 
AND EASTERN AREAS BAR ONE OR TWO 
SHOWERS IT SHOULD STAY FINE AND DRY 
YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRESS OF THE 
RAIN BOTH BANDS AS THEY MOVE 
NORTHWARDS BETWEEN THERE'LL BE DRY 
AND SUNNY BREAKS ONE OR TWO 
SHOWERS DEVELOPING THROUGH THE DAY 
IT WILL FEEL COLDER IF YOU ARE 
STUCK UNDER A HEAVY SHOWER OR THE 
RAIN RAIN THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT THE 
RAIN CONTINUES IN THE NORTH STILL 
SOME SHOWERS FOR SOUTHERN AREAS 
MANY OF THE SHOWERS WILL DIE AWAY 
THAT IS HOW WE START TOMORROW

OF ENGLAND AND WALES WITH SOME 
SUNSHINE AGAIN SHOWERS WILL 
DEVELOP FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AND 
SCOTLAND WE ARE LOOKING AT RAIN AT 
TIMES OR SOME SHOWERS SOME OF THE 
SHOWERS WILL BE HEAVY WITH HAIL AND 
THUNDER LIKELY AREAS THE SOUTH 
WEST OF ENGLAND TOWARDS THE 
MIDLANDS AND EAST ANGLIA THE SOUTH 
COAST TOMORROW WILL GET AWAY WITH A 
FINE DAY THE TOP TEMPERATURE IS SIXTY ONE 
FAHRENHEIT THAT IS HOW IT IS 
LOOKING LOOKING BACK TO THAT STORY ABOUT LOLLIPOP 
LADIES AND GENTS THEY HELP 
CHILDREN CROSS THE ROAD IT SHOULD 
HARDLY BE A HAZARDOUS PROFESSION 
THOUSANDS FACE ABUSE FROM DRIVERS 
NOW CAMERAS ARE ATTACHED TO THEIR 
STICKS TO CLAMP DOWN ON LOLLIPOP 
RAGE RICHARD IS IN HUDDERSFIELD 
THANK YOU THERE ARE NO CARS THERE 
HAS BEEN A 
THANK YOU THERE ARE NO CARS THERE HAS BEEN A 
CONSISTENT RECRUITMENT 
HAS BEEN A CONSISTENT RECRUITMENT PROBLEM WITH LOLLIPOP LADIES STILL 
FIVE PER CENT OF PLACES ARE EMPTY ONE OF THE 
REASONS OFTEN GIVEN IS THE ROAD 
RAGE AND ABUSE MOST DRIVERS ARE 
FINE THEN THEY GET A LOT OF PEOPLE 
MOUTHING OFF AND SOME PEOPLE 
DRIVING ACROSS THEM THIS IS ABOUT 
TRYING TO CHANGE THAT TRYING TO 
DETER SOME OF THOSE DRIVERS AND 
TRYING TO CATCH SOME OF THEM THAT 
OFFEND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEE 
THE LITTLE CAMERA IN THERE MEET 
VERA CAUGHT HERE ON A NEW LOLLIPOP 
KAM LEGALLY SHE HAS THE SAME 
STOPPING POWER AS A RED LIGHT ALL 
TOO OFTEN SHE FACES AGGRESSION 
ABUSE AND SOMETIMES WORSE 
A CAR IS 
STOPPED THIS SIDE THEN CHILDREN

NEARLY KNOCKED THE CHILDREN DOWN 
IF THE MUM HAD NOT PULLED THE 
CHILDREN OUT YOU KNOW OUT OF THE 
WAY THEY WOULD HAVE GOT RUN OFFER

SIMPLE 
IT IS ESTIMATED THERE ARE SIMPLE FOURTEEN HUNDRED RAGES AGAINST LOLLIPOP PATROLS 
EVERY YEAR EVERYTHING FROM VERBAL 
ABUSE TO DRIVING STRAIGHT PAST THEM 
ON VERY RARE OCCASIONS IT HAS BEEN 
FATAL A LOLLY POM LADY WAS KILLED 
IN LEEDS A FEW YEARS AGO YET IT 
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM GETTING 
EVIDENCE AGAINST OFFENDING DRIVERS 
WHICH IS WHERE THIS COMES IN O. K. 
HERE IS HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS THERE

MILITARY PLANE HIMSELF FOR PART OF 
THE JOURNEY MORE FROM OUR 
CORRESPONDENT AT CLARENCE HOUSE 
GOOD MORNING MARK THIS KEPT WELL 
UNDER WRAPS 
THAT'S RIGHT PROBABLY 
THE MOST STRIKING POINT ABOUT THIS 
IS WE DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
UNTIL AT OLIVER LETWIN A DAY AFTER 
PRINCE WILLIAM'S SAFE RETURN L. 
SUPPOSE THAT IS A MEASURE OF HOW 
SERIOUSLY THEY VIEW THE PRINCE THE 
SECOND IN LINE TO THE THRONE 
FLYING IT A FRONT LINE BASE IN 
AFGHANISTAN WE KNOW THAT PRINCE 
CHARLES AND THE QUEEN GAVE THEIR 
CONSENT BEFORE HE FLEW L. SUPPOSE 
THAT CONCERNS ABOUT HIS SAFETY 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN WHY THE VISIT WAS 
SO BRIEF HE SPENT JUST THREE HOURS 
THERE TALK TO SERVICE PERSONNEL 
BEFORE FLYING ON TO A SEPARATE BASE 
IN QATAR THE ISSUE OF THE ROYALS 
GOING TO AFGHANISTAN WAS VERY MUCH 
IN THE SPOTLIGHT WHEN PRINCE HARRY 
HIS TOUR OF DUTY THERE HAD TO BE 
CUT SHORT BECAUSE OF A MEDIA 
BLACKOUT I'M SURE THIS TOO WAS 
VERY MUCH IN THE MINDS OF THE 
PALACE THEY SAY THIS WAS ALL PART 
OF THE ONGOING PROCESS OF PREPARING 
PRINCE WILLIAM FOR THE TIME WHEN HE 
BECOMES HEAD OF THE ARMED FORCES 
IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS' TIME HE'LL 
MOVE TO THE NAVY TO GET SIMILAR 
EXPERIENCE WE HAVE AERD FROM A P. R.

BARCELONA WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE 
WE WILL HAVE AN ALL ENGLISH FINAL 
NINE YEARS AFTER HE SAT OUT THE 
LAST CHAMPIONS LEAGUE VICTORY FOR 
UNITED PAUL SCHOLES ROLLED BACK 
THE YEARS WITH A BRILLIANT GOAL 
THAT WAS ENOUGH TO GIVE UNITED THE 
VICTORY BARCELONA KEPT THE 
PRESSURE UP THROUGHOUT THEY CAN 
START DREAMING OF THE TRIP TO 
MOSCOW 
NEVER THOUGHT WE'D DO IT MOSCOW THE ATMOSPHERE 
WAS UNBELIEVABLE IT IT WAS AWESOME IN THERE 
CAN'T WAIT 
FOR THE FINAL 
BECAUSE UNITED ARE GOING TO 
MOSCOW SKHRAK

ARE YOU GOING DEFINITELY DEFINITELY ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
UNBELIEVABLE ABSOLUTELY NO ONE HUNDRED PER CENT SPEECHLESS SPEECHLESS WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE 
IN THE FINAL WITH LIVERPOOL WHY LIVERPOOL WHY BECAUSE THEY'RE EASIEST 
WE DIDN'T 
SAY THAT HE SAID THAT SIR ALEX 
FERGUSON IS HAPPY HE PRAISED HIS 
SIDE'S FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE WE'RE WE'RE THERE AS I SAY THE IMPORTANT THING 
IS WE'RE THERE IT DOESN'T MATTER 
WHO WE PLAY THAT WILL WORK OUT

CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI FINAL BEFORE 
BUT THIS IS A DIFFERENT PROPOSITION 
YEAH I THINK THAT TORRES GERRARD 
K. OYT ALONSO PEOPLE CAN SCORE 
FROM SET PIECES WE NEED TO SCORE 
ONE GOAL MAYBE IT COULD BE ENOUGH 
IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO START THE 
GAME AND THINKING ABOUT PLAYING ZERO TO ZERO 
YOU THINK THERE IS NO TEAM IN THE 
WORLD WHO WILL PLAY JUST FOR ZERO TO ZERO 
WE WILL PLAY WITH THE POSITIVE MOOD 
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SCORE 
A GOAL AND WE WILL MAKE IT EVEN 
MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM 
THINGS ARE 
GOING VERY WELL FOR UNITED JUST 
WHEN MANCHESTER CITY SEEM TO BE 
GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
THERE'S ANOTHER DRAMA DESPITE ONE 
OF THEIR MOST SUCCESSFUL SEASONS 
SVEN GORAN ERIKSSON IT SEEMS IS 
ON HIS WAY OUT ACCORD TO CLOSE 
FRIENDS ERIKSSON HAS DOUBTS ABOUT 
HIS FUTURE THERE THE OWNER THAKSIN 
SHINAWATRA HAS TOLD HIM HE'S NOT 
THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB ERIKSSON 
INFORMED THE PLAYERS ON MONDAY THAT 
HE WOULD BE DISMISSED PROVOKING AN 
ANGRY RESPONSE ANDY MURRAY 
STRUGGLES TO FIND HIS FEET ON CLAY 
HE LOST THE FIRST MATCH IN STRAIGHT 
SETS AGAINST MARIO ANCIC SIX TO FOUR SIX TO FOUR 
HE'S WON JUST THREE MATCHES ON CLAY 
IN HIS ENTIRE PROFESSIONAL CAREER 
DO 
YOU REMEMBER YESTERDAY L. TOLD YOU AND YOU ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN BREAK FROM 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN AND THE FACT HE 
WAS DREAMING OF BUYING A BENTLEY 
WITH THE S. P. D. S. ONE FIFTY SEVEN ZERO ZERO ZERO PRIZE MONEY 
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A 
RETHINK BECAUSE ALI CARTER REPEATED 
THE FEAT DURING HIS QUARTER FINAL 
AGAINST PETER EBDON IT'S THE FIRST 
TIME TWO MAXIMUM BREAKS HAVE BEEN 
MADE AT THE SAME CHAMPIONSHIP AT 
THE CRUCIBLE NOW THEY WILL HAVE TO 
SHARE THE MONEY THAT'S SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NOT 
QUITE ENOUGH FOR THE BENTLEY POOR 
OLD RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
HE COULD BUY 
SECOND HAND 
I'VE NOT IDEA 
APPARENTLY SOMEONE SAID HE MIGHT 
HAVE COVERED HIS BET IF HE PUT 
DOWN TEN THOUSAND AT SEVEN TO ONE HE MIGHT HAVE 
COVERED THE DIFFERENCE ALI CARTER 
HAS MADE THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN SO RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN PICKS UP SEVENTY THOUSAND 
SO HE 
GETS HIS BENTLEY 
HE MIGHT HAVE 
DONE DONE ABOUT A MILLION MIGRANT WORKERS 
CAME TO THE U. K. IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHEN THE E. U. 
EXPANDED TO INCLUDE EIGHT EASTERN 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES A STUDY OF 
MIEGRIGS TO BRITAIN BY THE 
INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY 
RESEARCH SAYS HALF OF THEM HAVE 
SINCE LEFT THE U. K. LET'S TALK TO DOCTOR 
DANNY SRISKANDARAJAH ONE OF THE 
REPORT'S AUTHORS GOOD MORNING TO 
YOU 
GOOD MORNING 
WHAT DID YOUR YOU REPORT FIND A MILLION CAME THE 
GOVERNMENT WAS ONLY PREDICTED 
SIXTY THOUSAND WEREN'T THEY 
YES WE FOUND 
THAT CONTRARY TO THE PREDICTIONS 
WE HAVE SEEN A STAGGERING AMOUNT OF 
IMMIGRATION FROM CENTRAL AND 
EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ABOUT A 
MILLION PEOPLE WE THINK HAVE 
ARRIVED IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS 
IMPORTANTLY WE THINK HALF OF THOSE 
PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY LEFT AND THAT 
MANY MORE WILL BE ATTRACTED BY 
IMPROVING CONDITIONS BACK HOME AND 
HEAD HOME OR HEAD ELSEWHERE WHAT WHAT DUE FIND IN YOUR REPORT ABOUT THE 
BENEFITS OR NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF 
IMMIGRATION OF COURSE THERE ARE 
DRAINS ON PUBLIC SERVICES NO DOUBT 
ABOUT THAT A LOT OF COUNCILS HAVE 
SAID THAT THEY'RE STRUGGLING COPE 
WITH THE AMOUNT OF EASTERN EUROPEAN 
SUDDENLY IN THEIR AREA BECAUSE 
THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES BUT 
OF COURSE THEY BRING BENEFITS AS 
WELL TO THE ECONOMY DOES ONE 
OUTWEIGH THE OTHER 
THE ECONOMIC 
BENEFITS ARE CLEAR AND STRONG WE 
HAVE A POPULATION THAT'S INCREDIBLY 
HARD WORKING THEY HAVE AN 
EMPLOYMENT RATE NINE PER CENT HIGHER THAN THE 
BRITISH THE LABOUR FORCE GOT A 
SHOT IN THE ARM JUST WHEN EMPLOYERS 
NEEDED WORKERS ON THE OTHER HAND 
WHEN YOU HAVE RAPIDLY CHANGING 
POPULATIONS ESPECIALLY IN PARTS OF 
THE COUNTRY THAT HAVEN'T HAD A LOT 
OF IMMIGRATION LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
HAVE A CASE FOR MORE RESOURCES THE 
PROBLEM THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY 
WITH IMMIGRATION BUT THE WAY WE 
FUND OUR LOCAL PUBLIC SERVICES 
THEY HAVE FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS THAT 
ARE SET UP MANY YEARS IN ADVANCE 
BEFORE THEY KNEW THAT THEY'D BE 
EXPERIENCING SUCH HIGH LEVELS OF 
IMMIGRATION 
YOU'RE SEEN AS A LEFT IMMIGRATION LEANING THINK TANK DOES THAT MEAN 
WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING WILL BE 
THOUGHT OF AS POSITIVE BY THE 
GOVERNMENT THAT MORE THAN HALF OF 
THOSE WHO'VE COME HAVE ALREADY LEFT 
AND THE BENEFITS THEY BRING 
OUTWEIGH THE NEGATIVES 
WE DID THIS 
REPORT FOR TWO REASONS THERE'S 
BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT JUST HOW 
MANY POLES AND OTHERS ARE HERE WE 
WANTED TO PUT A STOP TO THE 
GUESSING AND COME UP WITH AS 
DIFINTIVE A PICTURE AS POSSIBLE 
THAT'S ONE THING WE WANTED TO 
REMIND PEOPLE THAT WHILE LOTS OF 
PEOPLE ARE GETTING WORKED UP ABOUT 
HIGH LEVELS OF IMMIGRATION WE MAY 
BE MISSING THE POINT HERE WHICH IS 
THAT THIS MIGHT BE A TEMPORARY BLIP 
HERE THE GREAT EASTERN EUROPEAN 
MIGRATION MAY BE COME TO AN END AND 
BEFORE WE KNOW IT BRITISH EMPLOYERS 
IN RURAL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY MAY 
START CRYING OUT FOR MORE WORKERS 
TO PICK THEIR FRUIT 
THANKS VERY 
MUCH FOR COMING IN NICE TO SEE YOU 
IF YOU'VE GOT KIDS AND AN INTERNET 
CONNECTION YOU'LL KNOW THAT THEY 
MOSTLYLY SPEND HOURS CHAT TO THEIR 
FRIENDS ON SOCIAL NETWORKING 
WEBSITES DUE KNOW ONE OF THE MOST 
POPULAR OF THEM HAS A MINIMUM AGE 
LIMIT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THIRTEEN 
BEFORE YOU CAN SIGN UP TO BEBO 
THAT CAME AS A SURPRISE TO M. P.'S 
HOLDING AN INQUIRY INTO INTERNET 
SAFETY HERE'S JOHN WHITTINGDALE 
TALKING TO BEBO'S CHIEF SAFETY 
OFFICER 
MY DAUGHTER IS TWELVE SHE'S OFFICER BEEN ON BEBO AT LEAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS 
EVERY ONE OF HER FRIENDS IS SHE 
SPENDS OH HOURS ON IT IT IS 
UNIVERSAL WAY BELOW THIRTEEN DO YOU 
THINK THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE WHEN WHEN PARENTS REPORT TO US AND THEY 
REPORT TO US THAT THEIR CHILD IS 
UNDER AGE THEN WE WILL DELETE THAT 
ACCOUNT BECAUSE 
YOU SAID IN THE 
U. S. IT'S THIRTEEN 
THAT APPLIES FOR OUR 
WHOLE SERVICE 
SO MY DAUGHTER 
SHOULDN'T BE ON BEBO EVEN THOUGH 
SHE'S TWELVE 
THAT'S TRUE 
SO LESSON 
LEARNED WILL GARDNER IS FROM CHILD 
NET INTERNATIONAL GOOD MORNING 
GOOD MORNING 
TELL US WHAT YOU DO 
WE'RE A CHILDREN'S CHARITY OUR 
MISSION STATEMENT IS HELPING TO 
MAKE THE INTERNET A GREAT AND SAFE 
PLACE FOR CHILDREN JOHN JOHN WHITTINGDALE SURPRISED TO FIND OUT 
THAT BEBO HAS A THIRTEEN YEARS AGE LIMIT 
MOST SITES LIKE THIS HAVE AGE 
LIMITS THERE'S NO PASSPORT FOR 
ENTRY WE SHOULDN'T BE EXPECTING 
THIS AGE RESTRICTION TO PREVENT 
CHILDREN FROM GOING ONLINE IF BEBO 
DISCOVER OR OTHER SITES DISCOVER 
THAT CHILDREN ARE YOUNGER ON THEIR 
SERVICE THEN THEY WILL CLOSE THEIR 
ACCOUNTS BUT WE SHOULDN'T 
ANTICIPATE THAT BECAUSE THERE'S 
MILLIONS OF PROFILES 
HOW WILL THEY 
FIND OUT 
EXACTLY SOME OF THEM USE 
SOFTWARE TO PICK UP WORDS YOUNG 
CHILDREN MIGHT USE BUT THE 
MAJORITY OF YOUNGER CHILDREN'S HAVE 
PROFILES WITHOUT THE PROVIDER 
KNOWING 
DOES IT REALLY MATTER IF KNOWING THEY ARE USING IT 
YOUNGER CHILDREN 
ARE MORE VULNERABLE WHEN USING THE 
TECHNOLOGY THERE ARE RISKS PUT 
INTO CONTEXT OF THE POSITIVE SIDE 
THERE ARE RISKS OF CYBERBULLYING 
PEOPLE ARE MISUSING PERSONAL 
INFORMATION IN THE WORST CASE 
SCENARIO CHILDREN HAVE BEEN 
GROOMED BY ADULTS WITH A SEXUAL 
INTEREST 
HOW DO YOU CONTROL THIS INTEREST SORT OF THING 
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT 
THINGS THE SERVICE PROVIDER DOES 
HAVE AGE RESTRIKETIONS 
RESTRICTIONS DOES HAVE CONTROLS SO 
THEY CAN SET THEIR PROFILE TO 
PRIVATE TO CONTROL THE NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE ABLE TO VIEW THAT PERSONAL 
INFORMATION ONE SHOULD NOT RELY 
ENTIRELY ON WHAT THE SERVICE 
PROVIDER THE TOOLS THEY ARE 
PROVIDING IT IS IMPORTANT THE 
PARENTS GET INVOLVED IN WHAT THEIR 
CHILDREN ARE DOING AND CHILDREN 
KNOW HOW TO STAY 
ANYONE WITH 
CHILDREN KNOW YOU LOOK OVER YOUR 
CHILD'S SHOULDER WHAT DO YOU 
WANT YOU GET INTO A BATTLE WITH 
THEM OVER THEIR PRIVACY 
THIS IS AN 
ISSUE PARENTS HAVE TO FACE UP TO 
TECHNOLOGY WE WOULD ENCOURAGE 
PARENTS TO PARENT MORE ON LINE IT 
IS IMPORTANT CHILDREN NOW RULES 
ABOUT HOW TO STAY SAFE WHEN THEY 
USE TECHNOLOGY JUST AS WHEN YOUR 
CHILD WAS GOING TO A CITY FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IT IS VITAL TO OPEN 
LINES OF COMMUNICATION LEARN MORE 
ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY IF YOUR CHILD 
FELT THEY KNEW WHAT A SOCIAL 
NETWORKING SITE WAS AND WHAT IT DID 
THEY MIGHT BE MORE WILLING TO COME 
FORWARD AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT 
THIS IS BREAKFAST THESE ARE OUR 
MAIN STORIES PRINCE WILLIAM HAS

WIGHT WE ARE LOOKING AT SHOWERS 
RATHER THAN RAIN UNTIL WE GET TO 
DEVON AND CORNWALL THEN WE ARE 
BACK INTO THE RAIN THAT RAIN BAND 
COULD JUST CLIP THE EAST OF 
NORTHERN IRELAND FOR THE BULK OF 
NORTHERN IRELAND IT WILL BE A FINE 
DAY BAR JUST ONE OR TWO SHOWERS 
SO THEN THROUGH THE DAY THE RAIN 
IS LIKELY TO BE HEAVY INDEED IT 
WILL HAVE SOME HAIL AND ALSO SOME 
THUNDER AND LIGHTNING EMBEDDED IN 
IT AS IT MIGRATES NORTH YOU CAN 
SEE THE IMPROVEMENTS WHERE THE 
BREAKS ARE SOME SUNSHINE BUT THE 
RISK OF LOCAL SHOWERS THROUGH THE 
AFTERNOON THROUGH THE EVENING AND 
OVERNIGHT THE RAIN PUSHES 
NORTHWARDS THERE'LL BE SHOWERS 
AROUND IF ANYTHING DRYING UP IN

TO THE WEBSITE AND TAKE A LOOK AT 
IT THIS IS THE NEWS RELEASE 
ACCOMPANYING THIS FINAL REPORT THE 
FINAL REPORT INTO THIS FIVE YEAR 
INVESTIGATION INTO SUPERMARKETS BY 
THE COMPETITION COMMISSION AND 
THIS IS WHAT IT SAYS THE MEASURES 
INCLUDE A RECOMMENDATION FOR THE 
INCLUSION OF WHAT IT CALLS A 
COMPETITION TEST IN PLANNING 
DECISIONS IN OTHER WORDS MORE 
SUPERMARKETS MIGHT BE ALLOWED ON 
YOUR HIGH STREET IF IT IS FELT THAT 
ONE PARTICULAR CHAIN OF 
SUPERMARKETS IS OVER DOMNAPBLT IN 
AN AREA THERE WILL BE ACTION TO 
PREVENT LAND AGREEMENTS WHICH CAN 
RESTRICT ENTRY BY COMPETITORS IN 
OTHER WORDS STOPPING SUPERMARKETS 
HOARDING LAND SO OTHER RIVALS 
CANNOT BUILD IN THAT PARTICULAR 
AREA AND THE CREATION OF A NEW 
STRENGTHENED AND EXTENDED GROCERY 
CODE OF PRACTICE AND A 
RECOMMENDATION TO ESTABLISH AN 
INDEPENDENT OMBUDSMAN TO OVERSEE 
AND FORCE THE CODE SO A NEW OFS 
BUDSMAN TO PROTECT PARTICULARLY 
FARMERS L. AM SOMEWHAT SURPRISED 
SWRE THIS AHEAD OF TIME IT IS 
THERE IT IS ON THE WEBSITE IT IS 
AN OFFICIAL LOOKING DOCUMENTATION 
THERE IS A SLIGHT POSSCT WE HAVE 
BEEN HOAXED BY A HACKER BUT IT 
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAE WE HAVE BEEN 
FOR MARTIN REES A COMPETITION 
LAWYER THE FIRST YOU HAVE SEEN OF 
IT AS WELL IT IS ROUGHLY WHAT WE 
WERE EXPECTING 
IT IS EXACTLY WHAT 
WE WERE EXPECTING IT IS GOOD FOR 
ME I CAN SEE IT UPSIDE DOWN WHAT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS L. WILL TURN IT 
AROUND SO YOU CAN LOOK AT IT WILL 
THIS MAKE THE SLIGHTEST BITD OF 
DIFFERENCE 
I DON'T BELIEVE IT WILL DIFFERENCE MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL ACCEPT 
THE PLANNING CHANGE WHICH IS A BIG 
OF A RISK THAT WE END UP WITH MORE 
SUPERMARKETS MORE SUPERMARKETS 
NOT NECESSARILY IN THE HIGH STREET 
JUST OUTSIDE OUTSIDE THE CENTRE OF 
TOWN SUPERMARKETS ON THE EDGE OF 
TOWN TAKING AWAY TRADE FROM 
SMALLER SHOPS IN TOWN THERE MAY BE 
AN IMPACT ON TOWN CENTRES THAT 
PEOPLE DON'T WANT AND THAT IS 
SOMETHING WHICH THE COMPETITION 
COMPETITION DON'T SEEM TO HAVE 
ADDRESSED AT ALL 
READING THROUGH 
THE COMMENTS HERE FROM THE CHAIRMAN 
OF THE COMPETITION CHAIRMAN THERE 
IS GOOD CHOICE AND CO REAL 
COMPETITION BETWEEN RETAILERS AND 
ALSO SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF LOCAL 
AREAS WHERE LARGE GROCERY STORES 
FACE LIMITED COMPETITION AND LOCAL 
SHOPPERS LOSE OUT THAT GOS TO THE 
POINT YOU MADE THERE SMALL SHOP 
KEEPERS HAVE LOBBIED FOR A LONG 
TIME ON THIS ONE THERE IS 
SUSPICION THAT THE LARGE 
SUPERMARKETS HAVE LED TO THE 
CLOSURE OF LOCAL SHOPS THERE IS 
NOTHING IN HERE THAT WOULD 
ENCOURAGE MORE SMALL LOCAL SHOPS 
INDEPENDENT STORES EVEN THE LARGER 
ONES ARE STILL IN THE SAME POSITION 
AS THEY WERE BEFORE 
DO SUPPLIERS 
BENEFIT FROM HAVING A NEW 
OMBUDSMAN DOES THAT GIVE THEM MORE 
TEETH 
WELL THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM TEETH WHICH HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE OLD 
CODE WE HAVE A NEW CODE WE'LL 
HAVE A NEW CODE WHICH IS EXTENDED 
TO THE OTHER SUPERMARKETS MARKS AND AMP 
SPENCER LIDL SOME MERS FIELD 
WILL THE OMBUDSMAN WORK PROBABLY 
NOT THE SUPPLIERS WILL BE SHY OF

AFGHANISTAN EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY 
ONLY AFTER HE HAD BEEN GIVEN 
CONSENT BY THE QUEEN AND THE PRINCE 
OF WALES THAT HE FLEW TO KANDAHAR 
WHAT BEGAN IN THE SAFETY OF THE 
ENGLISH SKIES HAS ENDED IN 
CONFLICT ZONE PRINCE WILLIAM 
STARTED HIS FOUR MONTH ATTACHMENT 
WITH THE R. A. F. IN A TWO SEATING 
TRAINING PLANE NOW AS IT DRAWS TO 
A CLOSE HE'S FLYING THIS A 
MILITARY TRANSPORT MORE THAN FIFTY 
METRES LONG THE PRINCE LEFT R. A. F. 
BRIZE NORTON ON SUNDAY TAKING TO 
THE CONTROLS FOR A TIME AS HE 
HEADED FOR KANDAHAR AIRFIELD IN 
SOUTHERN AFGHANISTAN POSSIBLY 
FLYING IN OVER HELMAND PROVINCE 
HIS BROTHER PRINCE HARRY'S TOUR OF 
DUTY THERE WAS CUT SHORT AFTER THE 
BREAK DOWN OF A MEDIA BLACKOUT SO 
IT WAS NO SURPRISE THAT PRINCE 
WILLIAM'S VISIT WAS BOTH 
CONFIDENTIAL AND BRIEF AT KANDAHAR 
AIRFIELD HE SPENT JUST THREE HOURS 
CHATTING TO SERVICE PERSONNEL THE 
VISIT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS 
FAMILIARISING THE PRINCE WITH THE 
R. A. F.'S ACTIVE OPERATIONS BUT SOME 
ARE MORE CYNICAL ABOUT ITS PURPOSE 
IT'S A GOOD PUBLIC RELATIONS 
EXERCISE FOR WILLIAM IN VIEW OF 
THE BAD PUBLICITY LAST WEEK WHERE 
HE WAS DROPPING IN ON KATE 
MIDDLETON'S FAMILY IN AN R. A. F. 
HELICOPTER SO A BAD WEEK LAST WEEK 
GOOD WEEK NOW 
NOW HE HAS HIS WINGS 
PRINCE WILLIAM WILL NEXT TAKE TO 
THE SEA HE'S TO JOIN THE NAVY ON 
SECONDMENT IN JUNE 
CLARENCE HOUSE SAYS THE VISIT WAS 
ALL PART OF THAT PROCESS OF 
PREPARING PRINCE WILLIAM FOR WHEN 
HE TAKES OVER AS HEAD OF THE ARMED 
FORCES IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT 
KANDAHAR PROVINCE IS DANGEROUS 
IT'S JUST TWO WEEKS SINCE TWO 
AIRMEN LOST THEIR LIVE THERE'S IN A 
ROADSIDE BOMB CLARENCE HOUSE SAYS 
THIS WAS A SUCCESS BUT THAT'S 
LARGELY BECAUSE IT WENT WITHOUT A 
HITCH HITCH IN OTHER NEWS THIS MORNING THE 
POWER AND INFLUENCE THE BIG 
SUPERMARKETS CHAINS HAS BEEN 
CHALLENGED THIS MORNING DECLAN HAD 
IT ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO THE 
COMPETITION COMMISSION HAS PROPOSED 
MEASURES TO CONTROL THEIR INFLUENCE 
ON THE HIGH STREET LET'S SPEAK TO 
DECLAN DECLAN THE REPORT ISN'T UNEXPECTED AT ALL 
THIS IS THE CONCLUSION OF A FIVE 
YEAR INVESTIGATION INTO THE POWER 
OF THE SUPERMARKETS ON OUR LOCAL 
HIGH STREET THE AMOUNT OF 
COMPETITION BETWEEN THOSE 
SUPERMARKETS AND THE RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN SUPERMARKETS AND SUPPLIERS 
IN PARTICULAR WITH SMALL FARMERS 
AND THE CONCLUSIONS ARE BROADLY IN 
LINE WITH THE PRELIMINARY REPORT WE 
HAD A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO THEY 
ARE FIRST OF ALL THERE COULD BE 
MORE SUPERMARKETS ON YOUR HIGH 
STREET RATHER THAN FEWER 
SUPERMARKETS THE PLANNING RULES 
ARE BEING CHANGED SO THAT PLANNERS 
CAN LOOK AT THE LEVEL OF LOCAL 
COMPETITION THAT ALREADY EXISTS 
THIS MEAN THAT'S IF YOU'RE IN AN 
AREA WHERE ONE BIG SUPERMARKET IS 
DOMINANT THEN THE PLANNING LAWS 
COULD BE RELAXED TO ALLOW OTHER BIG 
SUPERMARKETS IN TO GIVE THE 
DOMINANT ONE A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY 
THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE NEW RULES 
TO COVER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 
SUPERMARKETS AND SUPPLIERS 
PARTICULARLY FARMERS THE EXISTING 
CODE OF PRACTICE IS TO BE 
TOUGHENENED TOUGHENED UP THERE'S 
TO BE THE CREATION OF AN OMBUDSMAN 
TO OVERSEE AND ENFORCE THAT CODE OF 
PRACTICE THEY'LL HAVE THE 
AUTHORITY TO GO OUT AND LOOK FOR 
CASES WHERE THINGS HAVE GONE WRONG 
RATHER THAN JUST WAIT FOR THE 
SUPPLIERS TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THEM 
ONE OTHER THING THAT IS ANOTHER 
CHANGE IN THE PLANNING LAW TO STOP 
SUPERMARKETS HOGGING LAND OR 
ATTACHING CONDITIONS TO LAND THAT 
THEY SELL TO PREVENT OTHER RIVALS 
BUILDING ON THEM THOSE CONDITIONS 
WILL HAVE TO BE SCRAPPED 
THE NEW NATIONWIDE SURVEY HAS 
RECORDED A FALL IN HOUSE PRICES FOR 
THE FIRST TIME EVER THE BUILDING 
SOCIETY SAYS HOUSE PRICES WERE ONE PER CENT 
LOWER IN APRIL THIS YEAR THAN AT 
THE SAME TIME LAST YEAR IT SAYS 
HIGHER MORTGAGE COSTS AND TIGHTER 
LENDING HAS SEEN A STEEP DROP IN 
THE NUMBER OF HOUSE SALES OVERALL 
MORE WITH DECLAN ON THAT AFTER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HELD A CANDLE 
LIT VIGIL IN AMSTETTEN TO SHOW 
SUPPORT FOR THE WOMEN IMPRISONED BY 
HER FATHER FOR ALMOST A QUARTER OF 
A CENTURY D. N. A. TESTS CONFIRM THAT 
JOSEF FRITZL IS THE FATHER OF HER 
SIX SURVIVING CHILDREN THE SEVENTY THREE 
YEAR OLD HAS BEEN REMANDED IN 
CUSTODY CUSTODY A TEENAGER FROM BRISTOL WILL APPEAR 
IN COURT TODAY ACCUSED OF INTEND TO 
COMMIT ACTS OF TERRORISM NINETEEN YEAR 
OLD ANDREW IBRAHIM WHO HAD 
RECENTLY CONVERTED TO ISLAM WAS 
ARRESTED AT HIS HOME IN THE CITY 
TWO WEEKS AGO THREE CONTROLLED 
EXPLOSIONS WERE LATER CARRIED OUT 
AT HIS FLAT 
PLANS TO GIVE PRISONERS IN ENGLAND 
AND WALES A PAY RISE FOR WORK THEY 
DO WHILE IN JAIL HAVE BEEN DROPPED 
BY THE GOVERNMENT THE INCREASE 
FROM FOUR FOR A FIVE DAY WEEK TO 
FIVE POINT FIVE OH WAS TO COME INTO EFFECT 
TOMORROW IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE 
FIRST RISE IN TEN YEARS 
HALF OF THE EASTERN EUROPEAN 
MIGRANTS WHO'VE COME HERE SINCE 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR HAVE ALREADY GONE BACK HOME 
ACCORD TO NEW RESEARCH THE 
INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY 
RESEARCH CLAIMS A MILLION PEOPLE 
EMIGRATED NOT U. K. FROM EASTERN 
EUROPE OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS 
THAT IS ABOUT TEN TIMES MORE THAN 
THE GOVERNMENT RIBLG NALLIEST MATED 
GRAHAM SATCHELL JOINS US THIS 
MORNING MORNING WE'RE IN THE MARKETPLACE IN 
NORTHAMPTON THIS MORNING PEOPLE 
ARE JUST GETTING THEMSELVES READY 
FOR THE DAY AHEAD NORTHAMPTON'S A 
CLASSIC ENGLISH MARKET TOWN UNTIL 
FOUR YEARS THERE WAS NO IMMIGRATION 
HERE TO SPEAK OF TODAY THERE ARE 
FOURTEEN THOUSAND EASTERN EUROPEANS HERE THEY 
MAKE UP ABOUT SEVEN PER CENT OF THE POPULATION 
TODAY'S REPORT GIVES THE CLEAREST 
INDICATION YET OF THE SCALE OF 
EASTERN EUROPEAN MIGRATION A 
MILLION HAVE COME THE IPPR SAYS 
IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS IT POINTS 
TO INTERESTING TRENDS HALF A 
MILLION HAVE ALREADY GONE HOME AND 
FEWER AND FEWER ARE COMING EVERY 
YEAR AS I'VE BEEN FINDING OUT THAT 
COULD HAVE QUITE AN IMPACT ON 
CITIES AND TOWNS LIKE THIS UP AND 
DOWN THE COUNTRY 
IT USED TO BE A CURRY HOUSE BUT 
THESE TWO HAVE TURNED IT INTO A 
POLISH RESTAURANT SHE WORKED IN A 
WAREHOUSE FOR TWO YEARS SAVED HER 
MONEY AND THEN OPENED THE 
RESTAURANT IN JANUARY 
I LOVE 
COOKING I LOVE NORTHAMPTON L. 
THINK I STAY HERE 
THOUSANDS OF 
POLES ARE PUTTING DOWN ROOTS 
OPENING BUSINESSES STARTING 
FAMILIES BUT TODAY'S REPORT SHOWS 
A COMPLEX PICTURE OF MIGRATION IT 
SAYS THE NUMBERS COMING IS START TO 
SLOW AND MANY POLES HALF A MILLION 
HAVE ALREADY GONE HOME AT THIS 
HAULAGE FIRM WE FOUND MARLENA POL 
SHE WORKS IN THE OFFICE GIVING 
INSTRUCTIONS TO THE POLISH DRIVERS 
BUT SHE SAYS LIKE MANY OF HER 
FRIENDS SHE HAS NO INTENTION OF 
STAYING 
WHEN I SPEAK TO PEOPLE STAYING THEY DON'T LIKE TOO MUCH ENGLAND 
BECAUSE IT'S A FOREIGN COUNTRY 
THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT'S WHY 
MOST OF THEM THINK COME BACK THE THE FALLING NUMBER OF MIGRANTS IS A 
WORRY FOR LOCAL FIRMS 
WE FIND SOME 
OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO 
DO THE JOBS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE 
POLISH PEOPLE WE WOULD FIND IT 
DIFFICULT TO FILL SOME OF THOSE 
JOBS 
TODAY'S REPORT SAYS AS THE JOBS POLES STOP COMING THE IMPACT ON 
SOME SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY COULD 
BE SEVERE 
THERE IS PARTICULAR CONCERN ABOUT 
AGRICULTURE FRUIT PICKING 
WAREHOUSE DISTRIBUTION AND PACKING 
TODAY'S REPORT MAKES AN INTERESTING 
CONCLUSION IT SAYS MANY OF THE 
ASSUMPTIONS WE'VE MADE ABOUT 
EASTERN EUROPEAN MIGRATION MANY 
MIGRANTS ARE COMING ALL OF THOSE 
COMING WITH GOING TO STAY MOST OF 
THOSE ASSMUPTIONS ARE WRONG IT'S 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS 
TO THINK HARD ABOUT AS IT PLANS FOR 
THE ECONOMY FOR THE FUTURE

AS YOU MENTIONED WE UNDERSTAND 
THAT STATE PROSECUTOR MAY BE

HAPPENED TO THE SEVENTH BABY THE 
BABY WHO DIED IN INFANCY THE 
POLICE SAY THAT IN HIS CONFESSION 
JOSEF FRITZL SAID HE DISPOSED OF 
THE BODY BY THROWING IT INTO AN 
OVEN THAT WAS USED FOR HEATING WE 
DON'T QUITE KNOW YET WHAT THAT 
CHARGE WILL BE WHETHER IT WILL BE 
ONE OF NEGLECT OR WHAT BUT THESE 
ARE THE SORT OF THINGS THIS MAN 
COULD BE FACING 
THAT VIGIL HELD 
LAST NIGHT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY 
FOR THE PEOPLE OF AMSTETTEN AND 
AUSTRIA TO SHOW THEIR FEELINGS IN 
SOME WAY ABOUT WHAT'S EMERGED 
ABSOLUTELY THIS IS TOWN STILL 
EXTREMELY VERY MUCH IN SHOCK 
DISBELIEF AND YOU KNOW LAST NIGHT 
WAS A WAY OF SHOWING THEIR SYMPATHY 
FOR ELISABETH AND HER FAMILY BUT 
ALSO I THINK WAY OF TRYING TO 
SHOW THAT THE PEOPLE OF AMSTETTEN 
WANTED TO SAY WE'RE NOT ALL LIKE 
THIS THAT THIS IS ONE 
EXTRAORDINARY THING THAT HAS 
HAPPENED BUT THAT WE'RE NOT A TOWN 
OF CRIMINALS BUT THIS IS A TIME 
WHEN I THINK PEOPLE HERE ARE DOING 
A LOT OF SOUL SEARCHING ASKING HOW 
IN THIS WELL ORDERED WELL KEPT 
TOWN IN THIS STREET OF NICE 
SUBURBAN HOUSES HOW COULD 
SOMETHING AS HORRIFIC AS THIS HAVE 
BEEN TAKING PLACE FOR SO MANY YEARS 
BETHANY BELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
MORE ON THAT THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON 
THE B. B. C. NEWS CHANNEL 
NOW HE WAS FOUND WITH A HOOD OVER 
HIS HEAD HIS HANDS TIED BEHIND HIS 
BACK THE BRITISH JOURNALIST 
RICHARD BUTLER WAS KIDNAPPED IN 
IRAQ IN JANUARY AND HELD FOR MORE 
THAN TWO MONTHS NOW FOR THE FIRST 
AND ONLY TIME ON BRITISH TELEVISION 
HE'S BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT HOW HE 
COPED WITH THE ORDEAL KATE 
SILVERTON HAS BEEN TALKING TO HIM 
REMIND US FIRST OF ALL WHAT HE WAS 
DOING IN IRAQ AND HOW HE WAS 
ABDUCTED 
RICHARD IS A VERY ABDUCTED EXPERIENCED JOURNALIST WORKING FOR 
C. B. S. AMERICAN NEWS NETWORK HE WAS 
IN BASRA ALONE TO ASSESS THE 
DANGERS BEFORE BRINGING IN HIS FILM 
CREW HE WAS TRYING TOINT VIEW THE 
SHIA CLERIC MUQTADA AL SADR WHOSE 
FOLLOWERS THE MAHDI ARMY CONTROLS 
MUCH OF BASRA HIS SAFETY HAD BEEN 
ASSURED BY THE MILITIA BUT IN THE 
EARLY MORNING MASKED MEN 
BALACLAVAS AND WEARING POLICE 
UNIFORM TOOK HIM IN A POLICE CAR TO 
A POLICE STATION FROM THEN ON HE 
WAS KEPT FOR NINE WEEKS 
HOW WAS HE 
TREATED DURING THOSE NINE WEEKS IN IN SOME PLACES WELL IN OTHER PLACES 
HE FEARED THAT HE WOULD BE EXECUTED 
THEY PLACED PLASTIC BAGS IN OUR 
MOUTHS AND TAPED OUR MOUTHS UP AND 
ALSO MOVED THE HANDCUFFS TO OUR 
BACK AND MOVED US AND AT THAT TIME 
AGAIN I THOUGHT THIS WAS PROBABLY 
GOING TO BE THE END MY TRANSLATER 
ACTUALLY SAID TO ME THEY ARE GOING 
TO KILL US 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
PROBLEMS IS HOW TO COPE 
PSYCHOLOGICALLY DID HE TALK TO YOU 
ABOUT THAT 
HE FINDS IT VERY HARD 
HE IS EMBARRASSED TO BE THE STORY 
AS ANY JOURNALIST WILL KNOW HE 
LOST THREE STONE IN WEIGHT FIZZLY 
TOUGH HIS EYESIGHT HAS BEEN BADLY 
AFFECTED BECAUSE HE WAS CONSTANTLY 
HOODED PSYCHOLOGICALLY FROM HIS 
EXPERIENCE THE ONLY THING HE COULD 
REALLY NOT DO WAS THINK ABOUT HIS 
FAMILY HIS MOTHER WAS DIAGNOSED 
WITH CANCER BEFORE HE LEFT TO GO ON 
THIS TRIP HE HAS A WIFE AND 
CHILDREN HE SAID THE ONLY THING HE 
COULD DO WAS ABSOLUTELY BLANK THEM 
OUT THAT IS SOMETHING HE FEELS 
REALLY GUILTY ABOUT NOW 
J. IF I AM 
HONEST WITH YOU NOW L. KNEW I WOULD 
NOT BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT MENTALLY 
I MADE A DECISION TO SHUT THEM OUT 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND IF I 
STARTED TO DRIFT MY THOUGHTS IN 
THAT DIRECTION I WOULD SAY TO 
MYSELF DON'T GO THERE L. HAD TO 
PROTECT MYSELF FROM THAT 
O. K. YOU 
HAVE KNOWN RICHARD FOR YEARS HE IS 
A CLOSE FRIEND OF YOURS YES YOU YES YOU KNOW HIS COMMITMENT TO THE JOB DO 
YOU THINK HE WILL GO BACK BASED ON 
THESE EXPERIENCES 
HE WILL GO BACK 
THAT IS THE DIFFICULT THING FOR HIM 
AND HIS FAMILY OF COURSE L. ASKED 
HIM ABOUT THAT HOW HE CAN 
RECONCILE THE GUILT HE FEELS THE 
BURDEN HE KNOWS HIS FAMILY HAS AS A 
RESULT OF THIS EQUALLY HE SAID TO 
ME I WOULD BE A SHELL OF A MAN IF 
I COULD NOT DO MY JOB HE DOES NOT 
WANT PEOPLE IN THE WEST TO LOOK AT 
IRAQIS AS SADISTS AND KILLERS HE 
SAYS THE STORY IS TOO IMPORTANT 
THE STORY HAS TO BE TELL 
HAS TO BE TOLD 
HOW DID IT COME 
TO AN END FOR HIM 
A DRAMATIC 
RESCUE INTERESTING CIRCUMSTANCES 
IN AS MUCH AS IT WAS REPORTED THAT 
SOLDIERS HAD GO IN IN LOOKING FOR 
WEAPONS THAT MILITIA WERE SAID TO 
HAVE THEY DISCOVERED RICHARD 
HOODED ON THE FLOOR AND VERY VERY 
DRAMATIC RESCUE HE WAS ALMOST SHOT 
THEN AS WELL AND LUCKILY ONE 
SOLDIER RECOGNISED AND THOUGHT 
ACTUALLY THIS IS SOMEONE THAT 
BESHOULD BE TAKING US AND DRAGGED 
HIM OUT AND THEN HE WAS PLACED IN 
THE CARE OF THE BRITISH MILITARY 
HE HAD HIS MEDICAL TESTS AND SO ON 
HE IS AS WELL AS CAN BE TODAY 
SEND HIM AND HIS FAMILY THE BEST

SOME GOOD SPELLS OF SUNSHINE THAT

NEWS ABOUT HOUSE PRICES GOOD 
MORNING EVERYONE JUST TO FLESH OUT 
SOME OF THE DETAILS YOU WERE GIVEN 
EARLIER ABOUT HOUSE PRICES WE HAVE 
HEARD THAT HOUSE PRICES HAVE BEEN 
SHRINKING FROM ONE MONTH TO ANOTHER 
HOUSE PRICES IN MARCH WERE SMALLER 
THAN THEY WERE IN FEBRUARY WE HAVE 
NEWS FROM THE NATIONWIDE WHICH SAYS 
HOUSE PRICES ARE LOWER THAN THEY 
WERE YEAR AGO THAT IS 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE NOW IN THE NEWS 
ABOUT THE HOUSING MARKET IT IS THE 
FIRST TIME SINCE MARCH NINETEEN NINETY SIX THAT 
HOUSE PRICES HAVE BEEN LOWER WHEN 
YOU HAVE LOOKED AT THEM IN ONE 
FROM ONE YEAR TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR 
SO THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN 
THE INFORMATION THE FIGURES ARE 
THESE THE AVERAGE HOPE IS NOW 
WORTH ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THAT IS ONE PER CENT LOWER 
THAN IT WAS THIS TIME A YEAR AGO 
ACCORDING TO THE NATIONWIDE WHICH 
IS THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST BUILDING 
SOCIETY IT WARNS THAT THIS IS 
LIKELY TO HAVE KNOCK ON EFFECT IN 
THE WIDER ECONOMY IT SAYS THAT 
SOME OF OUR SPENDING ON THE HIGH 
STREET WAS PAID FOR BY BORROWING 
AGAINST THE PRICE OF OUR HOMES AT 
A TIME HOUSE PRICES WERE RISING IT 
EXPECTS THAT TYPE OF BORROWING WILL 
EASE OFF AND CONSUMER SPENDING WILL 
BE HIT AS A RESULT OF THAT IT 
SAY IT THINKS THE BANK OF S. 
RECENT SCHEMES TO STABILISE THE 
FINANCIAL MARKETS WILL HAVE A 
POSITIVE BENEFIT ON THE HOUSING 
MARKET IT SAYS THE UNDERLYING 
CONDITIONS FOR MOST MORTGAGE 
BORROWERS ARE MORE POSITIVE THAN 
SOME WOULD SUGGEST 
RAIZRAIDS YOU MIGHT NOT BELIEVE IT 
BUT SOME 
YOU MIGHT NOT BELIEVE IT 
BUT SOME MOTORISTS HAVE BEEN 
ABUSIVE TO LOLLIPOP LADIES AND 
GENTS THAT NEW SECURITY MEASURES 
HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED THEY ARE 
LOLLIPOP KAMS THEY ARE INTRODUCED 
BY KIRKLEES COUNCIL TO GET A VIEW 
OF THE OFFENDERS 
GOOD MORNING AM WITH HAPPY 
BUNCH OF VOLUNTEERS EVERYONE LOOK 
HAPPY AND WAVE AT THE CAMERA THIS 
IS RAJ OUR LOLLIPOP LADY DO YOU 
WANT TO TAKE US OVER MARVELLOUS 
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEE THERE ARE 
TWO LENSES IN RAJ'S LOLLIPOP CAM 
THAT IS SO YOU CAN SEE NUMBER 
PLATES BOTH SIDES OF IT MEET VERA 
CAUGHT HERE ON A NEW LOLLIPOP KAM 
LEGALLY SHE HAS THE SAME STOPPING 
POWER AS A RED TRAFFIC LIGHT ALL 
TOO OFTEN SHE FACES AGGRESSION 
ABUSE AND SOMETIMES WORSE 
A CAR IS 
STOPPED THIS SIDE THEN THE 
CHILDREN STEPPED OUT AN AND MUM 
STEPPED OUT AND THE LADY JUST 
CARRIED ON AND NEARLY KNOCKED THE 
CHILDREN DOWN IF THE MUM HAD NOT 
PULLED THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE WAY 
THEY WOULD HAVE GOT RUN OVER THEY 
WOULD HAVE GOT KILLED IT IS SIMPLE 
IT IS ESTIMATED THERE ARE FOURTEEN HUNDRED 
RAGES AGAINST LOLLIPOP PATROLS EACH 
YEAR EVERYTHING FROM VERBAL ABUSE 
TO DRIVING STRAIGHT PAST THEM ON 
RARE OCCASIONS IT HAS BEEN FATAL A 
LOLLIPOP LADY WAS KILLED IN LEEDS 
FEW YEARS AGO YET IT HAS ALL BEEN 
A PROBLEM GETTING EVIDENCE AGAINST 
OFFENDING DRIVERS WHICH IS WHERE 
ROUTE SAFE COMES IN THERE ARE TWO 
CAMERAS ON THE POLL ONE FACING 
BACKWARDS THE EYES IN THE BACK OF 
VERA'S HEAD AND ONE FACING FORWARD 
IN THEORY ALL AROUND VISION 
DRIVERS CAUGHT FACE A FINE AND 
POINTS ON THEIR LICENSE IT IS NOT 
THE FIRST SYSTEM TO USE CAMERAS 
BUT IT IS THE FIRST TO MOUNT THEM 
ON THE POLL 
A REALLY GOOD IDEA 
ESPECIALLY FOR MY DAUGHTER'S SAFETY 
AND OTHER CHILDREN'S SAFETY IT IT MAKES ME FEEL HAPPY 
AND SAFER 
YEAH 
IT IS FANTASTIC YOU DON'T YEAH HAVE TIME TO GET A NUMBER PLATE 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE EYES IN 
THE BACK OH YOUR HEADS AT TIMES 
JUST CROSSING THEM IT IS WORSE 
WHEN YOU HAVE TO STAND YOUR KID'S 
LIVES ARE PRICELESS 
VERA IS 
CARRYING OUT A TEST UNIT THE 
MAKERS ASSURE US IT WILL BE READY 
FOR KIRKLEES COUNCIL IN THE MONTH 
OTHER COUNCILS ARE THEN SET TO 
FOLLOW YOU CAN LOOK HAPPY YOU 
HAVE HAD SOME PRETTY NASTY 
EXPERIENCES WITH DRIVERS TELL US 
YOU SAVED A LAD'S LIFE 
I DID 
ACTUALLY IT WAS AN INCIDENT WHEN 
THE TRUCK DRIVER 
WAS COMING FAST L. WAS IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND THE LITTLE BOY RAN INTO THE ROAD 
AND NEARLY KNOCKED HIM DOWN L. 
PUSHED HIM BACK WITH MY STICK YOU YOU DID NOT GET HIS NUMBER PLATE 
I WAS 
TOO BUSY MAKING SURE HE WAS O. K. AND 
LOOKING AT THE OTHER CHILDREN AT 
THE SAME TIME 
HOW OFTEN DO YOU GET 
ABUSE 
NEARLY EVERY OTHER DAY L. ABUSE GET A LOT SHOUTING ABUSE THROUGH 
THE WINDOWS AND BEEPING THEIR HORNS 
NEARLY EVERY OTHER DAY I GET QUITE 
A FEW DRIVERS 
IS THIS A GOOD IDEA 
I THINK IT IS A FANTASTIC IDEA 
AM LOOKING FORWARD TO USING THIS 
IT WILL MAKE MY JOB LITTLE EASIER 
THERE ARE A LOT OF DRIVERS WHO GO 
THROUGH YOU WHILE YOU ARE IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE ROAD 
DO YOU THINK IT 
IS A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE A CAMERA 
YES BECAUSE DRIVERS MIGHT DRIVE 
MORE CAREFULLY IF THEY KNOW THEY 
ARE BEING FILMED 
I HAVE SOME TRIVE 
YA FOR YOU LOOK AT THE LOLLIPOP 
SIGN SEE THIS BLACK STRIP IN THE 
FIFTIES IT WAS DESIGNED SO THE LOLLIPOP 
LADIES COULD WRITE NUMBER PLATES 
WITH CHALK ON SAME IDEA BUT 
DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY WE LIKE THAT 
LITTLE FACTOR FROM RICHARD THANK 
YOU YOU PAUL SAYS LOLLIPOP RAGE INDEED 
WHO ABUSES LOLLIPOP LADIES L. CAN 
UNDERSTAND PEOPLE GETTING CROSS 
WITH TRAFFIC WARDENS BUT LOLLIPOP 
LADIES ARE SWEET AND KIND 
APPLAUSING THE MISSION I CAN 
UNDERSTAND DRIVER'S FRUSTRATION 
WITH THE CROSSING PATROL PEOPLE L. 
LIKE MANY EXPERIENCE PEOPLE ABUSING 
THEIR POWER ON THE ROAD HE SAYS 
I FEEL SURE THE HIGHWAY CODE IS 
THERE TO MAKE IT SAFE FOR CHILDREN 
TO CROSS MANY STOP THE TRAFFIC TO 
LET PARENTS CROSS WHEN I POINTED 
IT OUT TO THE LAY LOLLIPOP LADY I 
WAS VERBALLY ABUSED HOPEFULLY THE 
CAMERAS CAN HAVE THEM DISCIPLINED 
IF EXCEEDING THEIR JOBS 
THIS IS NOT EXTINCT THIS IS VERY 
MUCH ALIVE THERE IS AN EXHIBITION 
IN SUNDERLAND ABOUT ODD SMELLS THIS

ONLY NOW AFTER PRINCE WILLIAM'S 
SAFE RETURN THAT CLARENCE HOUSE HAS 
DECIDED TO MAKE THIS PUBLIC L. 
SHOULD SAY THAT IT'S A MEASURE OF 
HOW SERIOUSLY THE ROYAL FAMILY 
WOULD TAKE A VISIT BY THE PRINCE 
WHO IS SECOND IN LINE TO THE THRONE 
IF A FRONT LINE THAT HE ONLY WENT 
AFTER HE HAD BEEN GIVEN CONSENT BY 
BOTH THE QUEEN AND THE PRINCE OF 
WALES WHAT CLARENCE HOUSE HAVE 
TOLD US IS THAT HE SPENT JUST THREE 
HOURS ON THE GROUND AT KANDAHAR 
AIRFIELD A VERY BRIEF VISIT THEY 
SAY IT WAS ABOUT FAMILIARISING 
HIMSELF WITH ACTIVE OPERATIONS OF 
THE R. A. F. IT WILL BE NOTED BY MANY 
PEOPLE I'M SURE THAT WHAT IS 
ESSENTIALLY A GOOD BIT OF PUB 
LISTLY FOR PRINCE WILLIAM COMES ON 
THE HE'S OF BAD PUBLICITY NOTABLY 
THE TWO OCCASIONS OF R. A. F. AIRCRAFT 
WERE CALLED INTO QUESTION AT 
CLARENCE HOUSE THEY WOULD DENY THIS 
WAS A P. R. STUNT THEY SAY IT'S PART 
OF ONGOING PROCESS OF PREPARING 
PRINCE WILLIAM FOR WHEN HE ONE DAY 
BECOMES HEAD OF THE ARMED FORCES 
IT IS OF COURSE A DANGEROUS AREA 
THAT HE'S VISITED HERE THEY'RE 
CALLING IT A SUCCESS LARGELY

BUT A ONE TO ZERO WIN AGAINST BARCELONA WAS 
ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE WE WILL HAVE AN 
ALL ENGLISH FINAL NINE YEARS 
AFTER HE HAD TO SIT OUT THE FINAL 
WAS PAUL SCHOLES WHO ROLLED BACK 
THE YEARS WITH A BRILLIANT GOAL IT 
WAS ENOUGH TO GIVE UNITED THE 
VICTORY BARSLON YAP KEPT THE 
PRESSURE UP THROUGHOUT LIONEL 
MESSI WAS ALWAYS A THREAT UNITED 
HELD ON AND FERGIE AND THE FANS CAN 
START DREAMING OF THE TRIP TO

VERY GOOD AND SOME GOOD PERFORMERS 
TONIGHT 
THAT LAD WANTED LIVERPOOL TONIGHT BUT WILL IT BE CHELSEA OR LIVERPOOL 
WHO PLAY MANCHESTER UNITED IN THE 
FINAL CHELSEA HAVE THE ADVANTAGE 
OF AN AWAY GOAL AFTER THE FIRST LEG 
LIVERPOOL MUST SCORE TO HAVE ANY 
CHANCE OF GOING THROUGH THEY'VE 
BEEN TRYING TO UNSETTLE CHELSEA BY 
HAVING A GO AT DIDIER DROGBA BY 
SUGGESTING THAT HE DIVES CHELSEA 
INSIST THEY'RE NOT BOTHERED WHAT 
LIVERPOOL HAVE TO SAY THEY'RE 
HAPPY TO CONCENTRATE ON WHAT THEY 
HAVE TO DO LIVERPOOL HAVE BEATEN 
CHELSEA IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE AT 
THE SEMI FINAL STAGE BEFORE BUT 
THEY NEED GOALS TONIGHT AND THAT'S 
A DIFFERENT PROPOSITION

THAT TORRES GERRARD BABEL 
CROUCHER I THINK THAT WE CAN SCORE 
WE NEED TO SCORE ONE GOAL MAYBE 
IT COULD BE ENOUGH 
IT'S ALWAYS 
DIFFICULT TO START THE GAME AND 
THINKING ABOUT PLAYING ZERO TO ZERO THERE 
IS NO TEAM IN THE WORLD WHO WILL 
PLAY JUST FOR ZERO TO ZERO WE WILL PLAY 
WITH A POSITIVE MOOD WE WANT TO 
MAKE SURE THAT WE SCORE A GOAL AND 
WE WILL MAKE IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT

THANK YOU 
A BIG INVESTIGATION INTO 
SUPERMARKETS IT HAS TAKEN A LONG 
TIME DECLAN HAS THE RESULTS THE 
INVESTIGATION IS OVER THE OVERALL 
VERDICT IS THIS SUPERMARKETS 
DELIVER A GOOD DEAL FOR CUSTOMERS 
GIVING US GOOD VALUE CONVENIENCE 
AND CHOICE IT CALLS FOR SOME 
CHANGES IT SAYS THERE SHOULD BE 
SOME COMPETITION IT IS CHANGING 
PLANNING LAWS TO ENCOURAGE MORE 
SUPERMARKETS IN A TOWN WHERE ONE IS 
DOMINANT IT WANTS TO TOUGHEN THE 
RULES WHICH COULD CONTROL HOW 
SUPERMARKETS TREAT SUPPLIERS 
PARTICULARLY SMALL FARMERS A NEW 
INDEPENDENT OMBUDSMAN TO ENFORCE 
THOSE RULES SUPERMARKETS WILL NOT 
BE ALLOWED TO HOARD LAND TO KEEP 
RIVALS OUT OR PREVENT LAND THEY 
SELL TO BUILD RIVAL STORES IT IS 
THE END OF A TWO YEAR INVESTIGATION 
MR. FREEMAN IS THE CHAIRMAN TWO 
YEARS 
YEARS A RANGE OF OPTIONS WHICH 
HAVE BEEN CRITICISED FOR BEING 
BLAND AND INEFFECTIVE DO YOU HAVE 
AN AWFUL LOT TO SHOW 
I THINK YOUR 
INTRODUCTION IS A LITTLE SIMPLISTIC 
ON THE WHOLE CONSUMERS ARE GETTING 
GOOD RESULTS FROM THE RETAILING 
INDUSTRY ON THE WHOLE IS AN 
IMPORTANT QUALIFICATION WE HAVE 
FOUND MONOPOLIES IN CERTAIN AREAS 
THESE ARE SERIOUS THINGS WHICH NEED 
TO BE FOLLOWED UP WE CANNOT DO 
ANYTHING OTHER THAN EXAMINE THE 
EVIDENCE WHICH KE WE HAVE DONE IF 
WE COME TO THE VIEW THAT THINGS ARE 
RIGHT THEN THAT IS THE ANSWER 
THERE IS NOT A PREJUDICE IN OUR 
INQUIRYS THAT WE WILL ALWAYS COME 
TO AN ADVERSE POINT OTHERWISE WHAT 
WOULD BE THE POINT OF HAVING AN 
EXHUSTIVE INQUIRY 
COMPLAINTS HAVE 
COME FROM SMALL STORES WHO SAY THEY 
ARE SQUEEZED OUT BY THE POWERS OF 
THE SUPERMARKETS THEY POINT TO A 
DECLINE ON THE NUMBER OF SMALL 
STORES IN HIGH STREETS THERE IS 
NOTHING IN THIS REPORT WHICH WILL 
HELP THEM THIS REPORT COULD SEE 
MORE SUPERMARKETS ON HIGH STREETS 
THERE IS GREAT DEAL ABOUT WHETHER 
SMALL SHOPS ARE IN DECLINE WE'VE 
HAD EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH 
REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE 
CONVENIENCE SECTOR WE HAVE EAST 
STBLISHED THAT THE PICK HUR IS 
MIXED AND THAT THE SMALL SHOP 
SECTOR IS NOT IN DECLINE 
CONDITIONS ARE TOUGH IN AN 
ATTRACTIVE AND INTERESTING 
PROPOSITION CONSUMERS WILL GO 
THERE SHOPPERS WILL GO THERE 
DON'T SEE THE SMALL SHOP SECTOR 
DECLINING 
YOU SAY THAT BUT THE DECLINING LAWYERS THAT SPEAK FOR THE 
CONVENIENCE SECTOR SAID THIS TO US 
THIS MORNING THIS REPORT FROM THE 
COMPETITION COMMISSION APPEARS 
DIVORCED FROM THE REALITY OF THE 
POWER OF THE BIG FOUR SUPERMARKETS 
THE SMALL SHOP OWNERS SAY YOU DON'T 
EVEN REALISE WHAT IS GOING ON ON 
THE HIGH STREET 
I REJECT THAT 
ENTIRELY I DON'T SEE HOW WE COULD 
NOT SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON AFTER AN 
INQUIRY OF THIS LEVEL AND SCALE 
THIS OF BUDSMAN TO PROTECT FARMERS 
ALL THESE PLANS SUFFER FROM ONE 
FUNDAMENTAL WEAKNESS THEY DO NOT 
SQUEAL BECAUSE THEY ARE TERRIFYING 
OF LOSING BUSINESS THEY WILL NEVER 
UNCOVER THE EVIDENCE BECAUSE 
SUPPLIERS WILL COVER UP 
THERE ARE 
TWO ISSUES FIRST WHAT CODE OF 
PRACTICE SHOULD BE OPERATING WE 
HAVE LOOKED AT THAT AND WE HAVE 
RECOMMENDATIONS TO STRENGTHEN THAT 
IN SOME SIGNIFICANT RESPECTS DON'T 
FORGET WE ARE LOOKING AT THE 
INTERESTS OF CONSUMER HERE AND NOT 
THE SUPPLIER AS REGARDS PEOPLE 
COMING FORWARD THE FEAR FACTOR WE 
HAVE OBTAINED A LOT OF INFORMATION 
IN THIS INQUIRY WE THINK AN 
OMBUDSMAN WHO CAN INVESTIGATE NOT 
ONLY SPECIFIC COMPLAINTS BUT THE 
MASS OF COMPLAINTS WILL SOLVE THIS 
AND ENABLE PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD 
THAT IS OUR EXPECTATION 
THANK YOU 
FOR JOINING US THAT LONG AWAITED 
REPORT IS FINALLY PUBLISHED 
DOING A LOT OF SNIFFING ON THIS 
PROGRAMME THIS MORNING

POWERFUL SCENT

CHALLENGED IN A REPORT WHICH CAME 
OUT THIS MORNING THE COMPETITION 
COMMISSION HAS PROPOSED A SERIES OF 
MEASURES TO CONTROL THEIR INFLUENCE 
ON THE HIGH STREET IN TRYING TO 
SECURE A FAIR DEAL FOR CONSUMERS 
AND SUPPLIERS IT HAS BEEN TWO 
YEARS IN THE MAKING THIS 
INVESTIGATION THIS FINE A REPORT 
FROM THE COMPETITION COMMISSION IT 
SAYS THAT SUPERMARKETS DELIVER A 
GOOD DEAL FOR CUSTOMERS PROVIDING 
AS WITH VALUE CHOICE AND 
CONVENIENCE BUT THEY NEED TO GET 
MORE OF A BRAND FOR THEIR MONEY IN 
LOCAL AREAS THE COMPETITION 
COMMISSION WANTS A CHANGE IN 
PLANNING LAWS SO THAT IN TOWNS 
WHERE ONE BIG SUPERMARKET IS 
DOMINANT AND THE SUPERMARKETS 
WOULD BE ALLOWED INTO PROVIDED WITH 
MORE COMPETITION THAT COULD LEAD 
TO MORE SUPERMARKETS IN YOUR LOCAL 
AREA PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT SMALL 
STORES SAY A FALL IN THE NUMBER OF 
STORES IN AN AREA SHOWED THAT BIG 
SUPERMARKETS ARE DAMAGING THE HIGH 
STREET THE COMPETITION COMMISSION 
HAS SAID THE ISSUE IS NOT AS CUT 
AND DRIED WE HAVE HAD EXTENSIVE 
DISCUSSIONS WE BEAT REPRESENTATIVES 
FROM THE CONVENIENCE SECTOR WE WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT THE PICTURE 
IS VERY MIXED AND THAT THE SMALL 
SHOP SECTOR IS NOT IN TERMINAL 
DECLINE CONDITIONS ARE TOUGH BUT 
COMPETITION IS TOUGH THE UN AREA 
OF CHANGE IS HOW SUPERMARKETS TREAT 
THEIR SUPPLIERS 
OTHER THERE IS 
TO BE A TOUGHER CODE OF CONDUCT AND 
THEN INDEPENDENT OMBUDSMAN TO SUIT 
TO ENFORCE RULES THEY MUST FIND 
EXAMPLES WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO A 
DAIRY FARMER FOR HIS REACTION ON 
THIS NEW REPORT A NEW NATIONWIDE 
SURVEY HAS RECORDED A FALL IN HOUSE 
PRICES FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER 
HOUSE PRICES WERE ONE PER CENT LOWER IN APRIL 
THAN THEY WERE AT THE SAME TIME 
LAST YEAR HIGHER MORTGAGE COSTS 
HAVE SEEN A STEEP DROP HUNDREDS OF 
PEOPLE HELD A CANDLELIT VIGIL IN 
AMSTETTEN TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR THE 
WOMEN IMPRISONED BY HER FATHER FOR 
ALMOST A QUARTER OF A CENTURY D. N. A. 
TESTS HAVE CONFIRMED THEIR JOSEF 
FRITZL IS THE FATHER OF HIS 
DAUGHTER'S SIX SURVIVING CHILDREN 
A TEENAGER FROM BRISTOL WILL APPEAR 
IN COURT TODAY ACCUSED OF 
INTENDING TO COMMIT ACTS OF 
TERRORISM NINETEEN YEAR OLD ANDREW 
IBRAHIM WHO HAD RECENTLY CONVERTED 
TO ISLAM WAS ARRESTED AT HIS HOME 
IN THE CITY TWO WEEKS AGO THREE 
CONTROLLED EXPLOSIONS WERE CARRIED 
OUT AT HIS FLAT PLANS TO GIVE 
PRISONERS IN ENGLAND AND WALES FOR 
WORK THEY DO IN JAIL HAS BEEN 
DROPPED BY THE GOVERNMENT THE 
INCREASE WAS TO COME INTO EFFECT 
TOMORROW IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE 
FIRST RISE IN TEN YEARS HALF OF THE 
EASTERN EUROPEAN MIGRANTS WHO HAVE 
COME HERE SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR HAVE ALREADY 
GONE BACK HOME THAT IS ACCORDING 
TO NEW RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR 
PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH CLAIMS A 
MILLION PEOPLE EMIGRATED TO THE U. K. 
FROM EASTERN EUROPE OVER THE LAST 
FOUR YEARS THAT IS TEN TIMES MORE 
THAN THE GOVERNMENT ORIGINALLY 
ANTICIPATED WE ARE IN THE MARKET 
SQUARE IN NORTHAMPTON THIS IS A 
CLASSIC ENGLISH MARKET TOWN WHICH 
HAD SEEN NO IMMIGRATION SINCE FOUR 
YEARS AGO TODAY THERE ARE FOURTEEN THOUSAND 
EASTERN EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS A 
MILLION MIGRANTS HAVE COME SINCE 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR HALF A MILLION HAVE GONE HOME 
FEWER AND FEWER ARE COMING EVERY 
YEAR THAT COULD HAVE QUITE AN 
IMPACT ON CITIES AND TOWNS LIKE 
NORTHANTS AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
IT USED TO BE A CURRY HOUSE IT IS 
NOW A POLISH RESTAURANT THIS WOMAN 
OPENED THE RESTAURANT L. LOVE 
COOKING I NEVER NORTHAMPTON I I THINK I WILL STAY HERE I LOVE 
THOUSANDS OF POLES ARE PUTTING DOWN 
ROOTS AND STARTING FAMILIES THE THE NUMBERS COMING IS STARTING TO SLOW 
AND MANY POLES HALF A MILLION 
HAVE ALREADY GONE HOME WE FOUND 
MARLENE POL SHE WORKS IN AN OFFICE 
GIVING INSTRUCTIONS TO THE POLISH 
DRIVERS LIKE MANY OF HER FRIENDS 
SHE HAS NO INTENTION OF STAYING 
WHEN I SPEAK TO PEOPLE THEY DO NOT 
LIKE ENGLAND 
IT IS A FOREIGN 
COUNTRY THAT IS WHY MOST OF THEM 
THINK THEY WILL COME BACK THE 
FALLING NUMBER OF MIGRANTS IS A 
WORRY FOR THE LOCAL FIRMS 
WE FIND 
THAT SOME OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE DO 
NOT ONE TO DO THE JOBS 
THAT IS WHY 
I NEED WE HAVE POLISH PEOPLE 
TODAY'S REPORT SAYS AS BE POLES 
STOP COMING THE IMPACT ON SOME 
SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY COULD BE 
SEVERE 
TODAY'S REPORT MAKES TWO SEVERE KEY CRITICISMS OF THE GOVERNMENT 
THEY HAVE GROSSLY UNDERESTIMATED 
THE AMOUNT OF MY CHRIS BAIRD WITH 
THE AMOUNT OF MIGRANTS THAT WOULD 
COME IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR MANCHESTER UNITED ARE 
MOSCOW BOUND THANKS TO A GOAL FROM 
PAUL SCHOLES AGAINST BARCELONA AT 
OLD TRAFFORD IT WILL BE AN ALL 
ENGLISH CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL ON 
MAY TWENTY FIRST AS UNITED WILL PLAY THE 
WINNERS OF TONIGHT CHELSEA 
LIVERPOOL SEMI FINAL SECOND LEG L. 
NEVER THOUGHT WE WOULD DO IT THE THE AT WAS FEARED WAS UNBELIEVABLE IT 
WAS AWESOME 
COME ON A RED SUIT 
I AM 
DEFINITELY GOING TO MOSCOW 
REDS 
WHO WERE DUE LIKE TO BE IN THE 
FINAL WITH 
LIVERPOOL BECAUSE THEY 
ARE THE EASY E. S. T. 
EAST THE E. S. T. 
THE ROYAL NAVY HAS TRACKED DOWN AN 
UNEXPLODED WORLD WAR TWO BOMB WHICH 
IT HAD LOST THE ONE THOUSAND CANN 
EXPLOSIVE THOUGHT TO BE DROPPED BY 
THE LUFTWAFFE WASHED UP ON A BEACH 
IN FELIXSTOWE LAST WEEK L. B. 
DIVERS EVENTUALLY FOUND IT THERE 
IT GOES AND DESTROYED IT IT CANNOT 
BE EASY TO FIND HOW DO YOU LOOK 
FOR IT VERY GOOD TRACK DIVERS 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU TO AUSTRIA 
WHERE AS WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING 
IS SPECIAL VIGIL HAS BEEN HELD OUR 
CORRESPONDENT IS BARE COVERING THE 
STORY FOR US SUPPOSE THE VIGIL 
IS THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT LOCAL 
PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO SHOW THEIR 
FEELINGS AND HORROR ABOUT WHAT HAS 
BEEN TAKING PLACE IN THAT HOUSE 
BEHIND YOU VERY MUCH SO 
IT WAS A 
WAY OF PEOPLE EXPRESSING THEIR 
OUTRAGE AND SYMPATHY FOR THE FAMILY 
THERE WAS A NOTE OF THE PEOPLE OF 
AMSTETTEN TRYING TO DISPLAY TO THE 
REST OF AUSTRIA AND THE WORLD THAT 
THEY ARE NOT JUST A TOWN OF 
CRIMINALS I THINK THERE IS A LOT 
OF SOUL SEARCHING GOING ON PEOPLE 
ARE ASKING HOW SUCH AWFUL THINGS 
COULD HAVE HAPPENED IN HIS NICE 
TIDY SUBURBAN COMMUNITY PEOPLE 
ARE WANTING TO SUGGEST THEY ARE NOT 
ALL LIKE JOSEF FRITZL SUGGESTIONS 
ARE BEING MADE THAT MR. FRITZ IT 
COULD BE FACING A MURDER CHARGE 
ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER 
ACCUSATIONS 
MR. FRITZL IT IS ACCUSATIONS STILL BEING WORKED OUT FOR DOG WE 
DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE FINAL LIST 
WILL BE 
WORKED OUT HIS LAWYER 
ANTICIPATE HE WILL BE CHARGED WITH 
RAPE PHYSICAL ABUSE AND 
IMPRISONING HIS FAMILY IN THE 
BASEMENT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT 
ANOTHER CHARGE IS BEING CONSIDERED 
THAT IT IS CONNECTED WITH THE DEATH 
OF THE BABY WHO DIED IN INFANCY IN 
HIS POLICE CONFESSION JOSEF FRITZL 
SAID THAT WHEN THE CHILD DIED IN 
INFANCY HE DISPOSED OF THE BODY BY 
THROWING IT INTO AN OVEN USED FOR 
HEATING PURPOSES IT IS NOT CLEAR 
WHAT THOSE CHARGES WILL BE MORE ON 
THAT STORY THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON 
THE B. B. C. NEWS CHANNEL 
LET'S TAKE 
YOU BACK TO THE STORY ABOUT THE 
SUPERMARKETS WHY WE SHOULD FOLLOW 
EIGHT TOUGHER SET OF RULES IN 
DEALING WITH SUPPLIERS TODAY'S 
REPORT IS LOOKING AT THE POWER AND 
INFLUENCE OF THE LARGE SUPERMARKET 
CHANGED CHAINS DOES THIS GO FAR 
ENOUGH WILL FARMERS AND FOOD 
MANUFACTURERS BE SATISFIED WE ARE 
JOINED BY A BREAKFAST FEWER YOU 
ARE SPARING SOME TIME OUT OF YOUR 
VERY BUSY DAY YOU HAVE HAD A BEEF 
WITH BIG SUPERMARKETS FOR SOME TIME 
TELL US ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE 
THEY ARE VERY POWERFUL AND NOT 
GIVING THE CONSUMER ANY GOOD AT ALL 
THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING DOESN'T 
SEEM TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT 
PROBLEM I'M PLEASED THIS MORNING 
TO READ THAT THEY HAVE AGREED TO 
THE OMBUDSMAN AND HOPEFULLY THEY 
WILL OPERATE WITHIN THE OFFICE OF 
FAIR TRADING JUST HOPE THEY HAVE 
GOT TEETH BECAUSE THE OFFICE OF 
FAIR TRADING HAS ALREADY DONE THE 
CONSUMER WHICH THEY WERE SET UP TO 
PROTECT HASN'T DONE THEM ANY GOOD 
UP TO NOW ELEVEN YEARS AGO IF YOU 
THINK THAT WE WERE GETTING THE SAME 
PRICE AS WE ARE TODAY THE CONSUMER 
ELEVEN YEARS AGO WAS PAYING FORTY P. TODAY 
THEY ARE PAYING FIFTY SEVEN OFF FIFTY EIGHT PENCE PER 
LITRE IT JUST GOES TO SHOW HOW THE 
CONSUMER IS BEING RIPPED OFF BY 
THEM 
WE ARE PAYING END FIFTY EIGHT THEM PENCE PER LITRE TO THE SUPERMARKET 
HOW MUCH OF THAT MONEY GOES BACK TO 
YOU 
TWENTY SIX P. THE BIG PROBLEM IS YOU COMPARED TO ELEVEN YEARS AGO OUR 
FERTILISER BILL AT THAT TIME WOULD 
BE IN THE REGION OF EIGHTY TO NINETY PER 
TONNE NOW WE ARE PAYING OVER THREE HUNDRED 
A TONNE OUR OTHER BILLS AT THAT 
TIME WERE ONE HUNDRED A TONNE MY RECENT 
QUOTE IS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY A TONNE MY FUEL HAS 
GONE FROM NINE P. A LITRE TO MY LATEST 
QUOTE AT FIFTY EIGHT P. A LITRE OUR COSTS 
HAVE ESCALATED OUT OF ALL 
PROPORTION IT'S INTERESTING REALLY 
THAT THE COUNTRY HAS BECOME SO 
RELIANT ON IMPORTED PRODUCT 
WHETHER IT IS FERTILISER CORN 
BECAUSE ECONOMY IN BOOK ARE 
BROUGHT IS CHANGING SO FAST WE ARE 
SUDDENLY REALISING AND I HOPE THE 
GOVERNMENT ARE REALISING THAT FOOD 
SECURITY IS A BIG ISSUE IN THE 
FUTURE 
THIS REPORT OUT THIS FUTURE MORNING SHOULD MEAN THAT THERE WILL 
BE MORE COMPETITION WHEN IT COMES 
TO SUPERMARKETS SO SUPERMARKETS 
WON'T DOMINATE IN ANY ONE AREA 
WILL THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO YOU 
DO YOU SELL TO ALL OF THE 
SUPERMARKETS ARE JUST TWO ONE DO ONE 
WE DO RELY AND SUPERMARKETS WE 
DON'T RELY AN EXCLUSIVELY OURSELVES 
THOSE PROCESSES SEEM TO BE SO WEAK 
WHEN IT COMES TO TRYING TO 
NEGOTIATE AND THE SUPERMARKETS ARE 
IMPOSING ALL SORTS OF THINGS NOW 
ONE FARMERS THEY HAVE TO DO 
COSTINGS WITH THE COMPANY AND HAVE 
TO SUPPLY THOSE COSTINGS TO THE 
SUPERMARKETS SO WE CAN ALL 
APPRECIATE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN 
TO THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK AT 
THE TOP TEN PER CENT AND BY THE WAY THE 
REST CAN GO UNFORTUNATELY THEY 
HAVE STILL BEEN IMPOSING A LOT OF 
THINGS ON FARMERS AND WE HAVE NO 
STRENGTH NOBODY AS THEY USED TO 
HAVE IN THE OLDEN DAYS WITH THE 
MILK MARKETING BOARD THEY ARE NOT 
ABLE TO HOLD THINGS TOGETHER I'M 
NOT SAYING WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO 
THAT BUT I DO SAY WE DO NEED AN 
OMBUDSMAN WITH TEETH THAT CAN 
ACTUALLY LOOK AT THIS AND THINK 
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY AND 
THE CONSUMERS HAVING THEIR CHOICE 
OF FOOD THEY WANT IF THEY WANT TO 
BUY FOOD FROM BRITAIN THEY REALLY 
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO START TO PAY 
US A SENSIBLE PRICE AND LOOK AT THE 
INDUSTRY MORE CLOSELY THE SUPPLY 
SIDE BECAUSE CURRENTLY THE 
YOUNGER PEOPLE JUST AREN'T WANTING 
TO COME INTO THE INDUSTRY 
WE FIND OUT HOW PATRICK DEMPSEY

ABSOLUTELY POURING IN LONDON AND 
IT IS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY 
AS WELL THE MET OFFICE STILL HAVE

TEN A M. THIS MORNING IT'S FOR THE

ARE HAMPSHIRE INTO GREATER LONDON 
AND BERKSHIRE AND WEST SUSSEX BY 
NINE A M. THE RAIN WILL BE WELL ACROSS 
SCOTLAND STILL ACROSS THE NORTH OF 
ENGLAND BUT PARTS OF THE NORTH OF 
ENGLAND SEEING SOME BREAKS A FAIR 
BIT OF CLOUD WITH SOME SUNSHINE 
COMING THROUGH THE RAIN BANDA 
CROSSED EAST ANGLIA THE MIDLANDS 
AND THE SOUTH EASTERN CORNER IT 
WILL BE AS FAR WEST AS THE ISLE OF 
WIGHT BEYOND THAT YOU WILL GET 
SOME SHOWERS UNTIL YOU HIT DEVON 
CORNWALL PARTS OF SOMERSET AND 
WESTERN AND SOUTHERN WALES THEN WE 
ARE BACK INTO THE RAIN AGAIN THE 
RAIN BAND AFFECTING PARTS OF 
EASTERN NORTHERN IRELAND BUT 
GENERALLY TODAY FOR THE BULK OF 
NORTHERN IRELAND IT'S GOING TO BE 
A FINE DAY WITH A FEW SHOWERS IF 
YOU ARE STUCK IN THE HEAVY RAIN THE 
TEMPERATURE WILL DROP QUITE QUICKLY 
SO IT WILL FEEL CHILLY SOME OF THE 
SHOW WAS MERGING TO GIVE HEAVIER 
DOWNPOURS THERE WILL BE SOME HAIL

ROUND BUT NOT PARTICULARLY COLD 
HERE IS WHERE WE WILL HAVE THE 
BRIGHTEST START TO THE DAY WITH 
QUITE A BIT OF SUNSHINE HOWEVER 
THERE WILL BE SHOWERS DEVELOPING 
ESPECIALLY SO THROUGH THE COURSE OF 
THE AFTERNOON FROM THE SOUTH WEST 
OF ENGLAND INTO THE MIDLANDS AND 
EAST ANGLIA SOME OF THEM WILL BE 
HEAVY BUT FOR THE REST OF ENGLAND 
AND WALES IT IS NOT A BAD DAY AT 
ALL SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND 
TOMORROW SEEING SOME RAIN AT TIMES 
AND ALSO SOME SHOWERS IN BETWEEN 
THE SHOWERS WE WILL HAVE SOME 
BRIGHTER SPELLS TEMPERATURES 
TOMORROW ARE UP A TOUCH ON TODAY 
EARLIER IN THE WEEK YOU DID SAY IT 
WAS GOING TO BE NICE AT THE WEEKEND 
DIDN'T YOU 
ON SATURDAY AT THE 
MOMENT IT IS LOOKING NICE BUT 
EASTERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IT 
WOULD BE QUITE WARM AND SUNNY BUT 
FOR THE WEST WE HAVE A FRIEND JUST 
STARTING TO SHOW SO THE WEST MAY 
WELL SEE SOME RAIN L. WILL FIRM UP 
ON THAT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
DAYS 
SHE WAS KEEPING ME GOING WITH THE 
IDEA OF GOOD WEEKEND IT SOUNDS 
UNBELIEVABLE BUT SOME MOTORISTS 
HAVE BEEN SO ABUSIVE TO LOLLIPOP 
LADIES AND GENTS AT SCHOOL 
CROSSINGS THAT THEY HAVE HAD TO 
INTRODUCE NEW SECURITY MEASURES 
THEY ARE LOLLIPOP CAMERAS AND ARE 
BEING INTRODUCED BYKER CLEESE 
COUNCIL TO GET VIDEO EVIDENCE OF 
THE OFFENDERS K. PLEASE L. HAVE 
BEEN CROSSING THIS ROAD ALL MORNING 
HOW SIMILAR DO THESE TWO LOLLIPOP 
STICKS LOOK THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS 
THE NEW WEAPON THEY HAVE GOT 
CAMERAS FRONT AND BACK WE'RE GOING 
TO TEST IT OUT NOW THESE ARE MY 
HAPPY VOLUNTEERS THE ROAD HAS GOT 
QUITE BUSY NOW YOU CAN REALLY SEE 
WHY THEY NEED A LOLLIPOP LADY HERE 
THEY HAVE ACTUALLY HAD A 
RECRUITMENT PROBLEM WITH LOLLIPOP 
LADIES RECENTLY FOR MANY YEARS 
BECAUSE ROAD RAGE IS PUTTING SOME 
PEOPLE OFF THIS IN THEORY HELPS 
COMBAT THAT HERE IS HOW IT WORKS 
METERED VERE COURTIER AND A NEW 
LOLLIPOP CAMERA SHE HAS THE SAME 
STOPPING POWER AS A RED TRAFFIC 
LIGHT LEGALLY BUT ALL TOO OFTEN 
SHE FACES AGGRESSION ABUSE AND 
SOMETIMES WORSE 
THE CAR IS STOPPED 
AT HIS SIDE AND THEN THE CHILDREN 
STEPPED OUT AND MUM STEPPED OUT AND 
THE LADY JUST CARRIED ON AND NEARLY 
KNOCKED THE CHILDREN DOWN IF THE 
MUM HADN'T HAVE PULLED THE CHILDREN 
OUT OF THE WAY THEY WOULD HAVE GOT 
RUN OVER THEY WOULD HAVE GOT 
KILLED 
IT'S ESTIMATED THERE ARE KILLED AROUND FOURTEEN HUNDRED RAGES AGAINST LOLLIPOP 
PATROLS EACH YEAR EVERYTHING FROM 
VERBAL ABUSE TO DRIVING STRAIGHT 
PAST THEM ON VERY RARE OCCASIONS 
IT HAS BEEN FATAL A LOLLIPOP LADY 
WAS KILLED IN LEEDS A FEW YEARS AGO 
YET IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM 
GETTING EVIDENCE AGAINST OFFENDING 
DRIVERS THIS IS WHERE RUUD SAFE 
COMES IN HERE IS HOW THE SYSTEM 
WORKS THERE ARE TWO CAMERAS ON THE 
POLL ONE FACING BACKWARDS THE 
EYES IN THE BACK OF HER HEAD AND 
ONE FACING FORWARDS GETTING ALL OF 
THE CARS APPROACHING THAT WAY IN 
THEORY ALL ROUND VISION DRIVERS 
CAUGHT FACE THIS FINE AND POINTS ON 
THEIR LICENCE IT'S NOT THE FIRST 
SYSTEM TO USE CAMERAS BUT IT IS THE 
FIRST TO MOUNT THEM ON THE POLL 
IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA ESPECIALLY 
FOR MY DAUGHTER'S SAFETY AND OTHER 
CHILDREN'S SAFETY 
IT MAKES ME FEEL 
HAPPY 
AND SAFER YES L. L. THINK IT'S HAPPY YES I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC YOU HAVEN'T TIME TO GET 
A NUMBER PLATE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT 
TO HAVE EYES AND THE BACK OF YOUR 
HEAD AT THE BEST OF TIMES JUST 
CROSSING SO IT'S EVEN WORSE WHEN 
YOU'VE GOT TO STAND KIDS LIKE 
SURPRISE US 
THE RE IS ACTUALLY 
TESTING OUT A TEST UNIT AND THE 
DIVIDED A BIT TEMPERAMENTAL BUT 
THE MAKERS ASSURERS IT WILL BE 
READY FOR THE COUNCIL WITHIN THE 
MONTH OTHER COUNCILS ARE THEN SET 
TO FOLLOW WE ALL GOT OVER SAFELY 
BUT WE DID HAVE SOME PROBLEMS 
GETTING THE PICTURES TO RECORD ON 
HIS LOLLIPOP CAMERA THEY SURE AS 
IT IS GOING TO BE FIT AND RARING TO 
GO AND LESS THAN A MONTH'S TIME WE 
SAW YOU CROSSING PEOPLE OVER THERE 
BUT YOU'VE HAD A PRETTY HORRIFIC 
EXPERIENCE YOU SAVED A LITTLE 
BOY'S LIFE 
I DID THERE WAS AN 
INCIDENT WHERE A LORRY WAS COMING 
REALLY FAST AND I 
HAD TO STOP L. HAD PUSHED THE BOY BACK WITH MY 
STICK I USED IT TO PUSH HIM BACK 
BECAUSE THE LORRY WOULDN'T HAVE 
STOPPED HE WAS COMING REALLY FAST 
DID YOU GET THE NUMBER PLATE I I COULDN'T NO BECAUSE I HAD TO 
CONCENTRATE ON MAKING SURE THE 
LITTLE BOY WAS SAFE AND THE OTHER 
CHILDREN WAITING TO CROSS US WELL 
I GUESS THAT IS THE ISSUE WITH 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS NOT HAVING TO 
WORRY ABOUT GETTING NUMBERPLATES 
DO YOU THINK IT IS GOOD IDEA A A FANTASTIC IDEA IT'S MADE MY JOB A 
LOT EASIER RATHER THAN HAVING TO 
GET A PEN AND PAPER AND WRITE THE 
NUMBER DOWN 
HOW OFTEN DO YOU GET 
ABUSE 
NEARLY EVERY OTHER DAY IT'S ABUSE USUALLY DRIVERS NOT STOPPING WHEN 
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD THEY 
BEAT THEIR HORNS AND SHOUT ABUSE 
FROM THE WINDOWS IT IS QUITE A LOT 
THAT SEEMS INCREDIBLE FOR PEOPLE 
YOU'VE GOT KIDS CROSSING THE ROAD 
AND PEOPLE ABUSING YOU 
I HAVE YES 
MY MAIN PRIORITY IS LOOKING AFTER 
THE KIDS FIRST BEFORE I CAN WRITE 
THE NUMBERS DOWN 
YOU DO A GREAT 
JOB VERY QUICKLY THIS IS EDWINA

UP ON BREAKFAST WE'RE CHECKING 
OUT THE SUPERMARKETS AND LOCKING AT 
WHETHER SHOPPERS ARE GETTING A FAIR 
DEAL FROM THE BIG BOYS 
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THIS SUN RISE 
WOULD SMELL LIKE WE'VE GOT AN IDEA 
WE'LL FIND OUT WHY A NEW EXHIBITION 
IS NOT TO BE SNIFFED AT 
JUGGLING A SUCCESSFUL FILM AND 
TELEVISION CAREER THE GREY'S 
ANATOMY ACTOR PATRICK DEMPSEY

MORNING CHRIS 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE 
MAD 
TO WORK HERE TPWU HELPS NOW NOW TO SPORT 
MORNING EVERYONE 
MANCHESTER UNITED ARE OFF TO MOSCOW 
FOR THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL 
ITUALS A TENSE NIGHT AT OLD 
TRAFFORD BUT A ONE TO ZERO WIN AGAINST 
BARCELONA WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE 
WE HAVE AN ALL ENGLISH FINAL NINE 
YEARS AFTER HE HAD TO SIT OUT THE 
LAST CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL PAUL 
SCHOLES ROLLED BACK THE YEARS WITH 
A BRILLIANT GOAL IN THE THIRTEENTH 
MINUTES THAT WAS ENOUGH TO GIVE 
UNITED THE VICTORY BARCELONA KEPT 
ON THE PRESSURE LIONEL MESSI 
ALWAYS A THREAT UNITED HELD ON 
MUCH TO THE DELIGHT OF THE FANS AND 
OF COURSE THAT MAN 
NEVER THOUGHT 
WE'D DO IT UNBELIEVABLE 
ATMOSPHERE UNBELIEVABLE 
IT WAS 
AWESOME IN THERE 
CAN'T WAIT FOR 
THE FINAL 
BECAUSE UET READY GOING TO 
MOSCOW 
COME ON REDS 
ARE YOU GOING TO 
MOSCOW 
I AM YEAH DEFINITELY MOSCOW UNBELIEVABLE ABSOLUTE NO 
SPEECHLESS 
WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEECHLESS BE IN THE FINAL WITH LIVERPOOL LIVERPOOL WHY 
BECAUSE THEY'RE EASIEST NOW WHY NOW WE DIDN'T SAY THAT SO WILL IT BE 
CHELSEA OR LIVERPOOL CHELSEA HAVE 
THE ADVANTAGE OF AN AWAY GOAL SO 
LIVERPOOL MUST SCORE TO HAVE ANY 
CHANCE OF GOING THROUGH THEY'VE 
BEEN TRYING TO UNSETTLE DIDIER 
DROGBA IN THE BUILD UP BY 
SUGGESTING HE DIVES CHELSEA INSIST 
THEY'RE NOT BOTHERED WHO LIVERPOOL 
HAVE TO SAY THEY'RE HAPPY TO 
CONCENTRATE ON WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO 
LIVERPOOL HAVE BEATEN CHELSEA AT 
THE SEM EYE FINAL STAGE BEFORE BUT 
THIS IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE 
TO SCORE 
YEAH TORRES GERRARD 
BABEL ALONSO PLAYERS THAT CAN 
SCORE GOALS AND FROM SET PIECES WE 
CAN SCORE WE NEED TO SCORE ONE 
GOAL AND MAYBE IT COULD BE ENOUGH 
IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO START THE 
GAME AND THINKING ABOUT PLAYING ZERO TO ZERO 
I THINK THERE IS NO TEAM IN THE 
WORLD WHO WILL PLAY FOR ZERO TO ZERO WE 
WILL PLAY WITH THE POSITIVE MOOD 
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SCORE 
A GOAL AND WE WILL MAKE IT EVEN 
MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM 
NOW YOU 
MAY REMEMBER YESTERDAY I TOLD YOU 
ABOUT RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HITTING A 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN BREAK AND HE WAS DREAMING OF 
BUYING A BENTLEY WITH THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND 
PRIZE MONEY HE MAY HAVE TO RETHINK 
WHY BECAUSE ALI CARTER REPEATED 
THE FEAT DURING HIS QUARTER FINAL 
AGAINST PETER EBDON THE FIRST TIME 
THAT TWO MAXIMUM ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVENS HAVE BEEN 
MADE AT THE SAME CHAMPIONSHIP THAT 
MEANS CARTER AND RONNIE HAVE TO 
SHARE THE PRIZE MONEY SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
EACH SADLY IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO BUY 
THAT BENTLEY BACK TO THE CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE A FEW E. MAILS SOME SAYING 
NO CHANCE OF INDEPENDENT TRAVELLERS 
APPARENTLY YOU HAVE REAL PROBLEMS 
IF YOU BOOK IT FOR YOURSELF MAKE 
SURE YOU GO THROUGH PROPER TRAVEL 
AGENTS AND AUTHORISED HOTELS BARRY 
SAYS THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND HOTEL BEDS AND THEY'RE 
EXPECTING WHAT FORTY THOUSAND FOOTBALL FANS 
THERE COULD BE PROBLEMS WARNINGS 
THAT IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE L. HAVE 
ALSO HAD A LONG CHAT WITH OUR GUEST 
FROM EARLIER TWO THINGS TO REMEMBER 
HERE WE GO IN RUSSIAN HE SPEAKS 
RUSSIAN CAN I HAVE TWO BEERS 
PLEASE AND THE OTHER THING WHICH 
IS VERY IMPORTANT HE SPEAKS 
RUSSIAN WHERE'S MY HOTEL ROOM 
ONE THING NOT TO SAY TO POLICE MAN 
WHICH IS L. LOVE YOU YOU IT MAN YOU IT WON'T GET YOU A VISA EITHER 
OR A 
TICKET FOR THE MATCH SEE YOU 
TOMORROW TOMORROW LET'S GO BACK TO THE LONG AWAITED 
REPORT INTO THE POWER OF 
SUPERMARKETS WHICH HAS BEEN 
PUBLISHED THIS MORNING IT CALLS 
FOR A BETTER DEAL FOR SHOPPERS AND 
SUPPLIERS THE COMPETITION 
COMMISSION SAYS A SUPERMARKET TSAR 
SHOULD BE APPOINTED TO MAKE SURE 
THAT FARMERS ARE TREATED FAIRLY 
IT'S CALMED FOR CHANGES IN PLANNING 
LAWS SHO THAT SUPERMARKETS DON'T 
HAVE A MONOPOLY IN ANY AREA WHAT 
DOES IT MEAN FOR US ADAM LEYLAND 
IS THE EDITOR OF GROCER MAGAZINE 
AND SIMON BRIAULT FROM THE 
FEDERATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES 
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN FIRSTLY 
WILL IT MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE TO THE 
SHOPPER 
YES IT WILL BUT IT WILL SHOPPER BE SUBTLE IT WILL MEAN IN TERMS OF 
COMPETITION FOR EXAMPLE YOU WON'T 
SEE SO MUCH OF IDEA OF GROWING 
NUMBER OF TESCO TOWNS THESE ARE 
THE TOWNS WHERE VIRTUALLY EVERY 
SUPERMARKET THERE IS A TESCO SO SO LOADS OF SUPERMARKETS NOW THOUGH 
YOU'LL GET MORE SHOPS AND A WIDER 
RANGE OF SHOPS A MARKS AND AMP SPENCER 
AN ASDA AND THAT SORT OF THING 
LAND BANKING THOUGH WILL BE ABLE TO 
CONTINUE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO 
REQUIRE THE BIG RETAILERS TO GET 
RID OF ANY UNDEVELOPED LAND THAT 
THEY OWN WHICH HAS BEEN AN ISSUE 
THAT PROBABLY WILL CONTINUE BUT 
EVEN THAT IS REALLY ONLY 
CONSIDERING THE COMPETITION BETWEEN 
DIFFERENT SUPERMARKETS THAT'S 
WHERE WE HAVE PROBLEM WITH THIS 
WE THINK THAT THE COMPETITION 
COMMISSION ONLY CARES ABOUT THE 
FACT THAT FOUR BIG SUPERMARKETS ARE 
COMPETING EFFECTIVELY AGAINST EACH 
OTHER WE THINK INDEPENDENT SHOPS 
AND RETAILERS HAVE PART TO PLAY 
HERE THEY'VE BEEN LARGING IGNORED 
THE COMPETITION COMMISSION WAS 
TELLING DECLAN THAT SMALL 
BUSINESSES WILL BE PROTECTED IT 
WON'T BE THAT THE BIG FOUR WILL 
DRIVE EVERYBODY OUT THAT'S NOT 
SOMETHING YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN 
THERE IS SENSE IN WHICH CONSUMERS 
HAVE TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO PROTECT 
SMALL SHOPS BY USING THEM USE THEM 
OR LOSE THEM 
EVEN IF THEY'RE MORE 
EXPENSIVE I MEAN PEOPLE SHOPPING 
ON A BUDGET THAT'S THE PROBLEM IF 
THE SMALLER SUPPLIER IS GOING TO BE 
A BIT MORE EXPENSIVE AND FOR THE 
CONVENIENCE THEY WANT TO GET ALL 
THEIR SHOPPING DONE IN TESCO 
THAT'S WHY SO MANY PEOPLE GO THERE 
THERE COULD BE A REASON WE THINK 
WHY IT MIGHT BE MORE EXPENSIVE IN 
SMALL SHOPS WE THINK THAT 
SUPERMARKETS UNFAIRLY USE THEIR 
POWER TO DRIVE DOWN PRICE FRZ 
SUPPLIERS WHICH MEAN THAT'S WHEN 
THOSE SUPPLIERS GO TO SMALL SHOPS 
THEY PUT THEIR PRICES UP WE THINK 
THAT'S UNFAIR WE DON'T THINK THE 
COMPETITION COMMISSION HAS DONE A 
GOOD ENOUGH JOB ADDRESSING THAT 
HOW CAN SMALL SHOPS REACH A GOOD 
SERVICE AND MORE CONVENIENT 
SERVICES IN MANY CASES HOW CAN 
THEY SURVIVE WHAT SHOULD THEY DO 
TWO THINGS FIRST THING TO SAY IS 
THAT THE REASON THEY'RE GOING OUT 
OF BUSINESS IS PARTLY BECAUSE 
SUPERMARKETS AND EFFECTIVE 
COMPETITION AN THE GREAT JOB THEY 
DO PARTLY BECAUSE OF THINGS LIKE 
RED TAPE LOCAL COUNCILS RED 
ROUTES AND THE PARKING RESTRICTIONS 
THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF POUNDS 
THEY MAKE PREVENTING ME FROM 
STOPPING OUTSIDE LOCAL SHOP AND 
SHOPPING THERE EVERYONE GOS TO THE 
TESCOS OF THIS WORLD BECAUSE IT'S 
CONVENIENT THEY HAVE CAR PARKS 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET FINED 
THAT'S FACTOR THE OTHER THING IS 
THERE'S DEMAND FOR FRESH FOOD 
THERE'S GROWING DEMAND AMONGST US 
ALL WE DON'T WANT ARTIFICIAL 
INGREED YEPBLTS THAT FAVOURS IN A 
WAY THE SUPERMARKETS THEY HAVE 
MORE EFFICIENT SUPPLY CHAINS WITH 
REFRIGERATED TRUCKS AND ALL THAT 
SORT OF THING THAT'S A REAL 
CHALLENGE FOR LOCAL SHOPS THEY 
CAN'T DO THAT SO EASILY THINK OF 
SHRIVELLED BANANAS AND MOULDY 
CARROTS THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR THE 
INDEPENDENTS SOME OF THEM DO IT 
BRILLIANTLY 
WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR BRILLIANTLY MIND SET TO WANT THE NATURALY OLD 
CARROTS FROM FIVE MINUTES UP THE 
ROAD 
ADAM MAKES A GOOD POINT ABOUT ROAD THE PARKING SITUATION THAT'S JUST 
ONE OF THE AREAS THAT THE 
COMPETITION COMMISSION HAS NOT 
CONSIDERED WE THINK IT'S UNFAIR 
THAT IN THE CENTRE OF TOWNS YOU'VE 
GOT A SITUATION WHERE THERE'S 
INCREASING PARKING RESTRICTIONS 
HEAVY FINES AND YOU NO THOSE ARE 
IMPOLESED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES BUT 
THE SAME LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE 
QUITE HAPPY FOR A SUPERMARKET ON 
THE OUTSIDE OF TOWN TO OFFER 
PRACTICALLY LIMITLESS FREE PARKING 
ADDRESSING THE FRESH PRODUCE ISSUE 
WE THIF AGAIN THAT THIS IS WHERE 
SMALL SHOPS CAN HAVE AN ADVANTAGE 
BECAUSE THEY CAN GET LOCAL PRODUCE 
YOU CAN GET FARMERS MARKETS YOU 
GET PRODUCE FROM REALLY VERY VERY 
LOCALLY THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE A 
BENEFIT CONSUMERS NEED TO 
RECOGNISE THAT 
THANKS VERY M. C. H. L. 
SPOKE TO A DAIRY FARMER EARLIER HE 
SAYS HE'S STILL GETTING THE SAME 
PRICE FOR MILK AS ELEVEN YEARS AGO TWENTY SIX P. 
A LITRE AND THE COST HAS GONE UP 
FROM FORTY P. TO FIFTY SIX P. THANKS VERY MUCH 
LIKE A PERSONAL INSULT YOU 
NATURALY OLD CARROTS WE'VE BEEN 
SMELLING THE SCENT OF A BEAUTIFUL 
WOMAN THIS MORNING 
OR WHAT SHE 
COULD SMELL LIKE 
NOT NICE EITHER 
MORE ON THAT TO COME CAROL HAS THE 
WEATHER SHE IS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN 
AND SMELLLES GREAT 
GOOD MORNING TO YOU IT IS POURING 
BUCKETS HERE IN LONDON IT IS 
RAINING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE 
COUNTRY AS WELL THAT IS WHERE I 
WILL START A MET OFFICE WARNING 
FOR HEY RAIN THE AREAS MOST 
AFFECTED ARE THE SCOTTISH BORDERS 
AND NORTHUMBERLAND HAMPSHIRE 
GREATER LONDON SUSSEX AND WEST 
BERKSHIRE IF IT IS NOT WITH YOU 
GET IT IS ON ITS WAY A NEW BAND 
IS MAKING PROGRESS ACROSS THE 
SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND NOT TOO LONG 
UNTIL THAP RAIN SWEEPS ACROSS 
SCOTLAND NORTH OF THE GREAT GLENN 
STILL FINE SOME BREAKS COMING 
THROUGH THE MORNING WITH SOME 
SUNSHINE HERE IS THE RAIN BAND 
PRETTY WET AT THE MOMENT AROUND THE 
ISLE OF PORTLAND FOR EXAMPLE AS WE 
SWEEP INTO THE SOUTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND WE ARE INTO ANOTHER RAIN 
BAND WHICH IS AFFECTING SOUTHERN 
AND WESTERN WALES THE RAIN BAND 
YOU CAN SEE EXTENDS UP THROUGH THE 
IRISH SEA IT COULD CLIP PASTS OF 
THE EAST OF NORTHERN IRELAND BUT 
THE REST OF NORTHERN IRELAND FINE 
AND DRY WITH ONE OR TWO SHOWERS 
THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE DAY IF 
YOU ARE STUCK UNDER THE RAIN BAND 
OR SOME HEAVY SHOWERS THE 
TEMPERATURE WILL DROP QUICKLY AND 
IT WILL FEEL COLD YOU CAN SEE THE 
MIGRATION OF THE RAIN INTO THE REST 
OF SCOTLAND AND PUSHING UP INTO THE 
NORTH OF ENGLAND AS WE GO INTO THE 
EVENING THE RAIN CONTINUES TO 
JOURNEY NORTHWARDS THERE'LL BE 
SHOWERS IN THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE 
COUNTRY WITH SHOWERS IN THE 
SOUTHERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY 
TENDING TO DIE AWAY HERE WE'LL 
HAVE BROKEN CLOUD BUT NOT 
PARTICULARLY COLD MUCH COOLER IN 
THE NORTH WHERE WE HAVE HAD THE 
BREAKS OVERNIGHT IS WHERE WE WILL 
SEE THE BEST OF THE SUNSHINE 
SHOWERS HERE WILL DEVELOP THROUGH 
THE DAY 
INTO THE MIDLANDS AND INTO EAST 
ANGLIA SOME SHARP WITH THUNDER 
FOR SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND 
WE ARE LOOKING AT RAIN AT TIMES 
BUT ALSO SHOWERS IF ANYTHING 
TEMPERATURES AUP TOUCH ON WHAT WE 
ARE LOOKING AT TODAY 
THANK YOU 
IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN AND AN 
INTERNET CONNECTION YOU WILL KNOW 
THEY ARE SPENDING HOURS CHATTING TO 
FRIENDS ON NETWORKING WEB SITES 
DID YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MOST 
POPULAR HAS A MINIMUM AGE LIMIT 
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THIRTEEN BEFORE 
YOU CAN SIGN UP TO BEBO THAT CAME 
AS A SURPRISE TO M. P.'S HOLDING AN 
INQUIRY INTO AN INTERNET SAFETY MY MY DAUGHTER IS TWELVE SHE HAS BEEN ON 
BEBO FOR AT LEAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS L. 
THINK EVERY ONE OF HER FRIENDS IS 
SHE SPENDS HOURS ON IT IT IS 
UNIVERSAL WAY BELOW THIRTEEN DO YOU 
THINK THAT IS INAPPROPRIATE WHEN WHEN PARENTS REPORT TO US AND THEY 
REPORT TO US THAT THEIR CHILD IS 
UNDERAGE THEN WE WILL DELETE THAT 
ACCOUNT 
YOU SAID IN THE U. S. IT IS ACCOUNT THIRTEEN THERE IS NO SUCH THING HERE 
THAT APPLYS TO OUR WHOLE SERVICE 
MY DAUGTDER SHOULD NOT BE ON BEBO 
EVEN THOUGH SHE IS TWELVE 
WILL GARDNER FROM CHILD NET 
INTERNATIONAL IT IS A SITE WHICH 
WANTS TO PROTECT CHILDREN 
WE WANT 
TO MAKE SURE CHILDREN ARE SAFE I I WOULD THINK VERY FEW KNEW THERE WAS 
AN AGE LIMIT FOR BEBO OR ANYTHING 
ELSE 
WHAT THIS SHOWS UP IS WE ELSE CANNOT RELY ON THE SERVAIS PROVIDER 
TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN SAFE ON ITS 
OWN IT IS IMPORTANT THAT PARENTS 
GET INVOLVED AND CHILDREN KNOW HOW 
TO STAY SAFE THERE IS NO PASSPORT 
AGE VERIFICATION YOU GO TO THE 
SITE YOU DECLARE YOUR AGE ON THAT 
BASIS YOU GET AN ACCOUNT P. YOU LIE 
ABOUT YOUR AGE THEN CLEARLY 
CHILDREN UNDER THIRTEEN CAN GO ON IT IT IT IS THE SAME WITH OTHERS 
IT IS NOT 
NECESSARILY THE SAME FOR OTHER 
SERVICES IT IS A BIT CLOUDY WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU ADVICE BE CHILDREN CAN 
GO ON LINE AND SIGN UP AS YOU SAY 
INDEPENDENTLY IT IS WHAT UP TO THE 
PARENT TO TALK TO THEM AND SAY I 
WILL SIGN UP FOR YOU MAKE SURE 
THEY ARE THERE 
WE ENCOURAGE 
PARENTS TO VISIT THE SITE LEARN 
ABOUT IT IT IS GOOD ADVICE ABOUT 
HOW TO STAY SAFE ON LINE WE HAVE A 
WEBSITE THERE ARE OTHER RESOURCES 
OUT THERE THE SERVICE PROVIDERS 
THEMSELVES HAVE GOOD ADVICE FOR 
PARENTS ADVISE FOR PARENTS AND 
MAKING SURE THEY KNOW THE KEY 
MESSAGES FOR THEIR CHILDREN NEED TO 
KEEP SAFE

BUMP INTO THE WRONG SORT OF PERSON 
THERE ARE SETTINGS YOU CAN MAKE 
YOUR PROFILE PRIVATE YOU CAN 
CONWHO IS ABLE TO ACCESS YOU THE THE CHILD OR CAN THE PARENT DO THAT UP UP TO THE CHILD YOU HAVE PRIVACY 
SETTINGS ON WHICH YOU SET OR YOU 
CAN MAKE IT OPEN TO ANY OF YOUR 
FRIENDS PEOPLE YOU KNOW YOU CAN 
MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO THE WIDER 
PUBLIC PUBLIC THANK YOU THERE IS SUCH A 
TEMPTATION AS A PARENT TO PEER OVER 
THEIR SHOULDER AND SEE WHAT THEY 
ARE DOING IT IS LIKE READING THEIR 
DIARY YOU HAVE TO ALLOW THEM SOME 
PRIVACY HAVEN'T YOU 
IT IS ANOTHER 
CHALLENGE FOR PARENTING THERE ARE 
NO SIMPLE SOLUTIONS HERE IT IS 
IMPORTANT FOR PARENTS TO GET 
INVOLVED IF A CHILD GETS INTO 
DIFFICULTY IT IS REASSURING FOR 
THEM THAT MY PARENT KNOWS WHAT BEBO 
IS THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP ME 
THANK YOU NOW WE HAVE BEEN 
SMELLING SOME INTERESTING SCENTS ON
