DECEMBER NINETEEN SIXTY SIX AND LONDON IS SWINGING 
THE NEW BEAT GROUPS ARE ROCKING THE CHARTS 
HENDRIX HAS JUST ARRIVED IN TOWN AND A MINI SKIRT IS ALL THE RAGE 
BUT TONIGHT BELONGS TO THE OLD SCHOOL 
ARRIVING IN STYLE FOR THE STAR STUDDED PREMIERE OF THEIR BRAND NEW FILM GERRY AND SYLVIA ANDERSON 
THEIR STUDIOS ON THE SLOUGH TRADING ESTATE 
HAVE BECOME A MINI HOLLYWOOD AND A MULTI MILLION POUND EMPIRE 
THEIR T. V. SHOW IS AN INTERNATIONAL HIT 
THEIR MOVIE WILL BE THE CHRISTMAS FILM 
BUT THE REAL STARS OF THE NIGHT ARE NOT PEOPLE 
THEY'RE PUPPETS 
THIS IS ALL ABOUT THUNDERBIRDS 
HOW BRITAIN'S FAVOURITE PUPPET SHOW WENT FROM SLOUGH TO THE STARS 
FIVE 
FOUR 
THREE 
TWO 
ONE 
THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO 
WHEN WE PLAYED AT THUNDERBIRDS AT SCHOOL 
I WAS ALWAYS SCOTT TRACY IN THUNDERBIRD ONE 
AND MY FRIEND WAS IN THUNDERBIRD TWO 
AT THE TIME I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ANY BIG DEAL 
I JUST SAID WELL MAKE THE TREES FOLD BACK 
SHE'S GOING 
PARKER YES MILADY 
OUR STRINGS TOUCHED AND IT WAS LIKE ONE THOUSAND VOLTS OF ELECTRICITY WENT THROUGH ME 
ALL THE SHOWS THAT WE DID BEFORE THUNDERBIRDS 
WERE LIKE A DRESS REHEARSAL FOR THE BIG ONE WHICH WAS THUNDERBIRDS 
JUST FIVE YEARS EARLIER 
YURI GAGARIN BECAME THE FIRST MAN IN SPACE 
I THINK IT'S HARD TO EXAGGERATE JUST HOW EXCITING SPACE AND SPACE TRAVEL 
WAS TO A CHILD GROWING UP IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES 
THE REASON IS THESE ARE THE YEARS OF THE SPACE RACE 
BETWEEN THE U. S. A. AND THE SOVIET UNION 
I WAS INTERESTED IN NOTHING ELSE 
I LITERALLY USED TO PRAY THAT I WOULD LIVE LONG ENOUGH 
TO SEE A MAN LAND ON THE MOON 
WE CHOOSE TO GO TO THE MOON IN THIS DECADE 
AND DO THE OTHER THINGS 
NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD 
THERE WAS ENORMOUS EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES OF SPACE TRAVEL 
ABOUT ROCKETS ROCKET SHIPS SPACE STATIONS ASTRONAUTS AND SPACEWALKS 
AND ALL OF THESE THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN EVERYDAY ELEMENTS OF A CHILD'S IMAGINATIVE LIFE 
JUST A FANTASTIC PLACE TO GO 
AND I ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT I WOULD GO THERE ONE DAY 
I WISH I WAS A SPACEMAN THE FASTEST GUY ALIVE 
IT COULDN'T COME QUICKLY ENOUGH FOR ME 
THERE WAS A REAL SENSE THAT TECHNOLOGY WAS GONNA CHANGE THE WORLD 
AND THAT THE PACE OF CHANGE WAS UNSTOPPABLE 
FIFTY YEARS FROM NOW HOME FOR SOME THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
COULD VERY WELL BE A CITY LIKE THIS 
BUILT OUT OF CONCRETE AND GLASS FIFTEEN MILES OUT INTO THE NORTH SEA 
WE'RE LIVING AT A TIME OF SUCH RAPID SCIENTIFIC CHANGE 
THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE ACCEPTING AS PART OF THEIR EVERYDAY LIFE 
THINGS WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN DISMISSED AS SCIENCE FICTION A FEW YEARS AGO 
THERE'D BE MANNED MISSIONS TO MARS EVERYBODY WOULD BE IN FLYING CARS 
CARS WOULD FLY AND THAT ALL SEEMED INCREDIBLY EXCITING 
DAD GOT A NEW CAR GREAT DOES IT FLY 
WE'D HAVE SILVER BOILER SUITS 
YOU'D BE ABLE TO TAKE A PAN AM FLIGHT TO THE MOON IF YOU WANTED 
I WANTED TO BE A SPACEMAN I THINK EVERY KID DID 
GERRY'S SHOWS ENABLED YOU TO BE THOSE SPACEMEN 
ALL MY THINKING DREW ME TO THINK OF THE FUTURE 
WHEN THEY WEREN'T WATCHING ROCKET LAUNCHES 
KIDS WERE EXPECTED TO MAKE DO WITH SOME PRETTY ROPEY PUPPET SHOWS 
BUT TECHNOLOGY WAS ABOUT TO TAKE OVER HERE AS WELL 
SUPERCAR 
PRODUCER GERRY ANDERSON HAD COME UP WITH A NEW WAY OF PRESENTING PUPPETS 
THROUGH A SYSTEM HE CHRISTENED SUPERMARIONATION 
I DID THIS WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TONGUE IN CHEEK 
AS THE YEARS ROLLED BY 
PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESS WOULD SAY 
ARE YOU GONNA MAKE THIS ONE IN SUPERMARIONATION 
I USED TO THINK IF YOU ONLY KNEW 
BUT EVERYBODY TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY 
LIKE THIS WAS ANOTHER FORM OF FILM MAKING 
SUPERCAR 
IT WAS A GUY CALLED MIKE MERCURY AND HE HAD THIS CAR THAT COULD GO 
AS THE SONG SAID AT THE BEGINNING 
THROUGH SPACE THE AIR ALONG THE ROAD 
UNDER THE WATER WHATEVER 
SUPERMARIONATION AND SUPERCAR EVERYTHING WAS SUPER 
DESPITE THE FACT GERRY HAD NEVER REALLY INTENDED TO WORK WITH PUPPETS 
I HAD IDEAS OF BECOMING 
WHAT STEVEN SPIELBERG IS TODAY 
SMOKE GENERATOR ON 
AND HERE I WAS MAKING PUPPET FILMS 
DOCTOR BEAKER WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY SMOKE 
NO SMOKE 
BUT AT LEAST GERRY'S PROCESS WAS HI TECH 
HE'D COME UP WITH A NIFTY WAY OF MAKING THE PUPPETS' LIPS MOVE 
THERE WAS THE SOLENOID WHICH HAD TO BE PUT INSIDE THE PUPPET HEAD 
WHICH WOULD OPERATE THE MECHANISM INSIDE THE MOUTH 
THE CURRENT FOR THAT HAD TO COME DOWN WIRES 
WHICH HELD THE PUPPETS UP 
I HAVE A SUGGESTION LET'S HAVE IT QUICK I THINK 
WHAT'S THE PLAN MIKE 
WELL DOCTOR BEAKER IS GONNA TAKE THE FILM BACK TO SATELLITE FILMS INCORPORATED 
THE BOTTOM LIP WAS HINGED THE CHIN WAS FIBREGLASS BUT LEFT A GAP THERE 
AND WE HAD TO FILL THAT GAP WITH SOMETHING THAT WOULD STRETCH 
AND LOOK AS IF IT WAS PART OF THE FACE 
THE ONLY MATERIAL THAT WORKED WERE CONDOMS 
AND THE BOYS USED TO HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF FUN 
GOING INTO A CHEMIST AND ORDERING TWENTY OR THIRTY 
DESPITE SUPERCAR'S ADVANCES THERE WERE STILL SOME LIMITATIONS 
WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE THE PUPPETS APPEAR TO DO MOST OF THE THINGS WE WANTED 
THE THINGS THAT WE COULDN'T DO WAS WE COULDN'T GET THE PUPPETS TO WALK 
WALKING WAS A THING YOU COULDN'T MAKE LOOK NATURAL WITH A PUPPET 
YOU HAVE TO LIFT THEIR FOOT UP AND PUT IT DOWN 
AND IT JUST DIDN'T LOOK LIKE A HUMAN WALK 
SO SUPERCAR'S FUTURISTIC DESIGN ALSO SERVED A PURPOSE 
IT SAVED THE PUPPETS HAVING TO WALK AROUND 
THE SERIES WAS BOUGHT BY T. V. MOGUL LEW GRADE 
WITH HIS INVESTMENT GERRY'S COMPANY BROUGHT IN 
SOME YOUNG SPECIAL EFFECTS ASSISTANTS 
WHO COULDN'T WAIT TO START THEIR OWN SPACE RACE 
I THINK WHAT WE WERE AIMING FOR 
WAS EXCITEMENT AND THRILLS AND THAT WAS OUR GOAL 
SO EVERYTHING WE DID WAS FAST IT WAS NOISY IT WAS EXPLOSIONS 
FIRE ONE ROGER FIRE ONE 
TO START OFF IT WAS JUST A BANG AND A FLASH 
EVERYONE GOT A LIGHTER AND SUPERCAR HAD TWO STUCK UP ITS EXHAUST PIPES 
YOU LIT IT AND RAN AND THAT WAS IT 
IF IT BURNT A STRING IT FELL OFF 
THE FIRE BRIGADE USED TO COME OUT BECAUSE THE CEILING WAS ALIGHT THINGS LIKE THAT 
EVERYTHING WAS A LITTLE BIT TRIAL AND ERRORISH BUT WE LEARNED 
THOUGH SUPERCAR WAS GOOD IT WAS STARTING TO GET EXCITING IT WAS STILL VERY PUPPETY 
AND FIREBALL I THINK WAS THE FIRST ONE 
THAT TOOK IT AWAY FROM THAT AND MADE IT SORT OF ALMOST GROWN UP 
O. K. VENUS O. K. STEVE RIGHT 
THEY RAISED THE STAKES WITH EACH ONE 
AND THEY GOT MORE AND MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY CLEVER 
THE NEXT SERIES FIREBALL X. L. FIVE LIFTED OFF IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO 
AT THE CONTROLS A HERO WHO WAS MORE DAN DARE THEN YURI GAGARIN 
DAN DARE IS KIND OF AN INTERESTING FIGURE BECAUSE HE'S NOT THIS 
INCREDIBLY FUTURISTIC SCI FI HERO 
HE'S ACTUALLY A REALLY OLD FASHIONED STIFF UPPER LIP LANTERN JAWED 
BULLDOG DRUMMOND STYLE FIGHTER PILOT 
A SORT OF BIGGLES FOR THE FUTURE 
HE'S VERY BRITISH AND VERY OLD FASHIONED 
I THINK YOU SEE A LOT OF THAT KIND OF APPEAL 
IN THE LANTERN JAWED GERRY ANDERSON HEROES 
WHO ARE IN SOME SENSE DAN DARE CLONES 
LIKE ALL YOUNG MEN OF HIS GENERATION 
GERRY HAD DONE HIS NATIONAL SERVICE 
THE R. A. F. WAS A PLACE OF SCRATCHY UNIFORMS 
STIFF UPPER LIPS AND GREAT BIG PLANES 
AS AN R. A. F. PILOT YOU KIND OF FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF BIGGLES 
I WAS AT MANSTON 
AT THE TIME IT HAD THE LONGEST RUNWAY IN THE COUNTRY 
SO IT WAS USED FOR EMERGENCIES 
IF AN AIRCRAFT HAD A FAULT IT WOULD BE DIVERTED TO MANSTON 
BECAUSE IT HAD THIS VERY LONG RUNWAY 
THERE WERE AIRCRAFT THERE LIKE LANCASTER BOMBERS 
THAT WAS A GREAT THRILL 
LISTEN TO WHAT I SAY CAREFULLY TAKE OVER AT THE CONTROLS 
BUT NOW HE WAS IN CIVVY STREET THE RELUCTANT PUPPET PRODUCER 
WAS STILL TRYING TO FIND WAYS 
OF MAKING HIS PILOTS LOOK LIKE THE REAL THING 
I NEVER WANTED TO DO WHAT I WAS DOING 
AND SO I WAS VERY CRITICAL OF THE PUPPETS 
AND CONSTANTLY THINKING WHY CAN'T THEY DO THIS 
HOW CAN WE GET THEM TO DO THAT 
I WAS DESPERATELY TRYING TO IMPROVE THEM 
TRYING TO MAKE THE PUPPETS LOOK AS REAL AS POSSIBLE 
I WAS REALLY SAYING TO THE INDUSTRY 
LOOK OBVIOUSLY I CAN MAKE LIVE ACTION FILMS CAN'T I 
BUT IT WAS ALL COUNTER PRODUCTIVE 
BECAUSE EACH SHOW WAS MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN THE LAST 
AND SO THEY CAME BACK AND SAID CAN WE HAVE ANOTHER PUPPET SHOW 
I WAS TRAPPED TYPECAST 
BY NOW GERRY WAS MARRIED TO ONE OF THE PRODUCTION TEAM SYLVIA TAN 
AS THE PROGRAMMES BECAME MORE SUCCESSFUL 
LEW GRADE PUMPED MORE AND MORE MONEY INTO THE STUDIO 
FIREBALL X. L. FIVE AND SUPERCAR HAD BEEN MAJOR SUCCESSES IN THE U. S. A. 
LEW GRADE WAS REALLY THE SPEARHEAD BEHIND MANY OF THE SIXTIES PROGRAMMES 
EVEN THE ADULT PROGRAMMES LIKE THE PRISONER AND THE SAINT 
WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED IF LEW GRADE HADN'T ACTUALLY JUST SAID 
LET'S DO IT 
LEW GRADE CAST AN ENORMOUS SHADOW COS HE WAS VERY VERY BIG 
AND HE HAD A BIG ROLLS ROYCE AND HE HAD A BIG CIGAR 
AND HE HAD BIG IDEAS 
AND THE BIG IDEAS WERE VERY VERY GLOBAL ANGLO AMERICAN 
HE WAS AIMING TO DO FROM MARBLE ARCH 
WHAT AMERICANS DID IN TELEVISION FROM L. A. 
HE WAS AIMING TO MAKE CHUNKS OF GLOBAL T. V. AND SELL THEM WORLDWIDE 
THE MAIN THING HE DID WAS 
HE VIRTUALLY GAVE ME A BLANK CHEQUE TO DO WHATEVER I WANTED TO DO 
STAND BY FOR ACTION 
WITH GRADE'S MONEY 
ANDERSON'S AMBITION TO MAKE BIGGER AND BETTER SHOWS WAS PAYING OFF 
IF THEY WERE SELLING A SHOW TO AMERICA 
THEN IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT IT WAS THE LATEST AND IT WAS IN COLOUR 
WE ARE ABOUT TO LAUNCH STINGRAY 
WHEN WE HEARD IT WAS GOING TO THE STATES 
IT HAD TO GET BETTER AND BETTER 
STINGRAY STINGRAY 
ALTHOUGH BRITAIN WAS STILL WATCHING IN BLACK AND WHITE 
THE NEXT SERIES WAS SHOT IN GLORIOUS COLOUR 
AND INSTEAD OF OUTER SPACE 
IT HEADED INTO THE UNCHARTED DEPTHS OF THE OCEANS 
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR 
STINGRAY WAS A VEHICLE AND THAT WAS THE MAIN CHARACTER 
SO ME AND MY FRIEND PLAYED AT BEING STINGRAY ALL THE TIME 
MARINA 
AND PROBABLY LIKE A LOT OF BOYS I DID FANCY MARINA 
WHAT ARE THESE STRANGE ENCHANTMENTS 
THAT START WHENEVER YOU'RE NEAR 
I THINK MY BROTHER DID TOO 
WHILE MARINA WAS GIVING NEW MEANING TO THE WORDS WET DREAM 
GERRY'S CREW WERE IN THEIR ELEMENT 
EXPLOSIONS UNDER WATER YOU'VE SEEN THE WAY THAT WORKS 
YOU GET THE EXPLOSION THE ROCKS ARE DROPPING DOWN 
WE PUT AIR LINES IN INTO THE TANK AND IT'S BUBBLING 
IT GIVES IT THAT BUBBLES GOING UP AND STUFF COMING DOWN 
YOU'VE GOT FISH AND WE HAD TO GET SCALED FISH IN THE FOREGROUND 
AND YOU HAD TO TAP THE TANK TO GET THEM TO SWIM THROUGH SHOT 
TO GIVE IT SOME FORM OF REALISM AND THEN ALL THE FISH FLIPPED OFF OUT 
A TRIUMPH FOR STINGRAY 
AND A FURTHER SUCCESS FOR TECHNICIANS AT A BRITISH FILM STUDIO 
FOR WE ARE BEHIND THE SCENES 
OF THE WORLD FAMOUS TELEVISION SERIES STINGRAY 
WHERE SKILFUL SCIENCE DECEIVES THE EYE AND NOTHING IS WHAT IT SEEMS 
STINGRAY WENT INTO DRY DOCK AFTER THIRTY NINE EPISODES 
BY EARLY SIXTY FIVE LEW GRADE WAS ASKING THE ANDERSONS TO CREATE SOME NEW HEROES 
A BRAND NEW TELEVISION SERIES IS ABOUT TO BE FILMED 
THE COMPLETED PUPPETS PERFECT DOWN TO THE SMALLEST DETAIL 
ARE HANDED TO THE EXPERT PUPPETEERS 
WHO WILL BRING THEM TO LIFE ON THE SCREEN 
WE MADE THE PILOT FILM AS A HALF AN HOUR SHOW 
AND I TOOK IT TO SHOW LEW GRADE 
IN A VERY LOUD VOICE HE SAID 
GERRY THIS IS NOT A TELEVISION SERIES 
OF COURSE MY LITTLE WORLD COLLAPSED 
I THOUGHT THIS IS THE END YOU KNOW 
AND THEN HE WALKED ALL THE WAY UP TO ME AND HE WAGGED HIS FINGER 
RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY FACE AND SAID 
THIS IS A FEATURE FILM WHICH WAS WONDERFUL 
HE THEN SAID YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE THEM AS ONE HOURS 
I SAID FINE LEW BUT WE'VE ALREADY SHOT NINE EPISODES 
AND WE'VE GOT ANOTHER THREE ALREADY WRITTEN 
HE SAID I DON'T CARE 
THEY'VE GOT TO BE MADE AS AN HOUR 
EACH ONE HAD TO BE UNDONE 
THEY HAD TO BE ENLARGED FROM ABOUT WHAT WAS IT 
TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO FIFTY MINUTES SORRY SCOTT 
AND NOW ALL IS READY 
THE DIRECTOR HAS A FINAL CHECK AND THE CAMERAS ROLL 
GO AHEAD JOHN WE HAVE OUR FIRST EMERGENCY CALL FATHER 
THE FIREFLASH MACH SIX ATOMIC AIRLINER IS IN DISTRESS AT LONDON AIRPORT 
THE FIREFLASH 
O. K. SCOTT AWAY YOU GO THUNDERBIRD ONE WILL BE UNDER WAY IN THIRTY SECONDS BOYS 
THUNDERBIRD TWO WILL BE RIGHT BEHIND HIM 
THUNDERBIRDS BURST ONTO OUR SCREENS ON THIRTIETH SEPTEMBER NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE 
WHEN ALL THE VEHICLES GET LAUNCHED THAT WAS THE COOLEST BIT 
THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT TECHNOLOGY CAN MAKE LIFE EASIER 
THAT IT'S EASIER TO BE TRANSPORTED ON SOME HYDRAULIC LIFT 
INTO A ROCKET THAN JUST TO WALK THERE OR CLIMB A LADDER 
I HAVE TO HARK BACK TO THE LIMITATIONS OF THE PUPPETS 
HOW DO WE GET THE CREW TO GET INTO THUNDERBIRD TWO 
THUNDERBIRD TWO IS A VERY HIGH VEHICLE 
THEY CAN'T WALK LET ALONE CLIMB A LADDER OR A STAIRCASE 
THUNDERBIRD TWO ROLLS ALONG THE RUNWAY 
SOMEBODY SAID IT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT 
BECAUSE THE WINGS WILL TOUCH THESE TREES 
AND I JUST SAID MAKE THE TREES FOLD BACK 
THEY SAID OH THAT'S AN IDEA 
THEY FITTED THE TREES TO TWO BROOMSTICKS 
AND A MAN AT THE END WOULD HAVE A BROOMSTICK IN EACH HAND 
AND HE WOULD JUST ROTATE THE BROOMSTICK AND THE OTHER ONE 
AND THE TREES WOULD BOTH ROLL OUTWARDS 
THE BRAND NEW VEHICLES IMMEDIATELY TOOK ON 
AN ICONIC STATUS OF THEIR OWN 
WELL BOYS LOVE THAT STUFF DON'T THEY 
IT WAS WHEN WE FIRST GET A TELEVISION 
AND IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST EVER MOVING PICTURES I THINK I EVER SAW 
THUNDERBIRDS REALLY KIND OF TUNED IN TO WHAT BOYS LIKED AT THE TIME 
WHEN WE PLAYED AT THUNDERBIRDS AT SCHOOL 
I WAS ALWAYS SCOTT TRACY IN THUNDERBIRD ONE 
MY FRIEND WAS IN THUNDERBIRD TWO YOU KNOW VIRGIL 
IN A WAY AS A KID I WASN'T THAT INTERESTED IN THE PLOT 
I JUST WANTED TO GET TO THE VEHICLES AND EXPLOSIONS AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE 
THE END SEQUENCE OF THE PILOT WHEN THE PLANE IS LANDING ON THE WHEELS 
I MEAN EVEN NOW I GO COLD WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT 
CUT ENGINES 
FIREFLASH OVERSHOOT OVERSHOOT 
GERRY ANDERSON WAS DOING WHAT IS NOW ONLY POSSIBLE WITH C. G. I. 
IT'S EASY TO WRITE A SCENE ON A PAGE 
BUT NONE OF THAT ACTUALLY EXISTS 
IT ALL HAS TO BE CREATED AND THEN IT'S ALL SHOT LIKE LIVE ACTION 
FIREFLASH LIFT PORT WING LIFT PORT WING 
CUT POWER 
NOWADAYS YOU WOULDN'T ATTEMPT THAT WITHOUT C. G. I. 
APPLY MAXIMUM BRAKES 
THEY MADE IT THEY MADE IT 
IT WAS SO EXCITING COS YOU REALISED THAT NOBODY HAD DONE THIS BEFORE 
O. K. SCOTT GOOD TIMING 
THANKS VIRGIL 
THUNDERBIRDS WAS MADE TO FIRST FEATURE STANDARD 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LIGHTING THE SETS NOTHING WAS LEFT TO CHANCE 
IT WAS JUST MADE LIKE A FIRST FEATURE FILM 
I MEAN THIS ISN'T ANDY PANDY ANY LONGER 
THIS IS SOMETHING VERY VERY DIFFERENT 
THE LAVISH MODELS AND SPECIAL EFFECTS MADE THUNDERBIRDS 
THE MOST EXPENSIVE T. V. SHOW EVER MADE IN BRITAIN 
AND THE HOUR LONG FORMAT MEANT IT COULD OFFER MUCH MORE THAN EXPLOSIONS AND RESCUES 
INTERNATIONAL RESCUE 
IF ONLY I KNEW THEIR SECRETS 
IT GAVE IT A BIT MORE DEPTH 
A HALF HOUR ISN'T VERY LONG 
IF YOU'VE GOT A STORY THAT HAS A BEGINNING A MIDDLE AND AN END 
A HALF HOUR TWENTY FIVE MINUTES 
IS NOT A LONG TIME TO GET ALL THAT ESTABLISHED 
AND OF COURSE EVERYTHING STOPPED FOR TEA 
INTERNATIONAL RESCUE 
LADY PENELOPE SPEAKING 
THAT PADDING GAVE IT THE EXTRA DIMENSION IT NEEDED 
THESE STORIES WEREN'T OVER IN A FLASH 
YOU CALLED MILADY 
YES PARKER GET THE ROLLS ROYCE 
WE ARE GOING FOR A LITTLE DRIVE 
COMPLICATION PILED ON COMPLICATION 
IT MADE THE WHOLE THING MORE SUSPENSEFUL AND DRAMATIC 
AND ALLOWED FOR MORE INTERACTION WITH THE ACTUAL CHARACTERS 
TO EXHIBIT THEIR OWN PERSONALITIES 
THE THUNDERBIRDS ARE NOT MANNED BY JUST A GROUP OF RESCUERS 
THEY'RE MANNED BY A FAMILY AND YOU HAVE THAT VERY IMPORTANT CORE OF THE STORIES IS THIS IS ABOUT THE FAMILY 
THEY'RE BROTHERS 
IT'S THEIR FATHER WHO'S SENDING THEM OFF ON THESE MISSIONS 
RIGHT FATHER 
O. K. FATHER 
SURE THING DAD YEAH FATHER 
AND SO THERE'S A VERY STRONG EMOTIONAL CORE AT THE CENTRE OF THE STORIES 
WELL ALAN 
TINTIN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE TO BE HERE DON'T YOU 
SURE DAD NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US TINTIN AND I ARE GONNA PLAY TENNIS 
WITH STORY WITH CHARACTERISTICS THEY BECAME CHARACTERS THEY BECAME PEOPLE 
YOU DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THEM AS PUPPETS 
O. K. SCOTT YOU'RE IN CHARGE 
WHAT'LL BE YOUR FIRST DECISION THAT'S EASY 
I CONTACT JOHN IN THUNDERBIRD FIVE 
SCOTT WAS LIKE THE LEADER HE HAD HIS FEET FIRMLY PLANTED ON THE GROUND 
WHAT'S UP SCOTT NOTHING JOHN 
JUST WONDERED HOW THINGS WERE WITH YOU 
SCOTT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SORT OF LEADER OF THE PACK ASIDE FROM THE OLD MAN 
NOW HOLD ON BOYS I'M STILL GIVING THE ORDERS ROUND HERE 
VIRGIL WAS SLIGHTLY ARTISTIC PLAYED THE PIANO AND PAINTED 
HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO GET A GOOD LIKENESS IF YOU DON'T KEEP STILL 
AND THEN THERE WAS LOVELY ALAN HERE WHO WAS THE BABY AND SPOILT 
RIGHT LAUGH THIS ONE OFF 
HEY 
ALAN WOULD BE A BIT DIFFICULT TO KEEP IN LINE SOMETIMES 
GORDON NOW LISTEN YOU'VE GOT TO LOCATE THEM WITHIN THE NEXT TWO MINUTES 
GORDON SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME UNDER WATER JOHN WAS UP IN THE SATELLITE 
COME IN JOHN INTERNATIONAL RESCUE FROM THUNDERBIRD FIVE HI SCOTT 
IT WAS A FAMILY 
AND WITH ALL THE UPS AND DOWNS AND SLIGHT AGGRAVATIONS AT TIMES 
THAT A FAMILY WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH 
SAY WHERE'S TINTIN GOT TO GORDON 
DON'T TELL ME YOU HAVEN'T HEARD VIRGIL 
THIS PRINCE CHARMING FLEW IN AND IS REALLY SWEEPING HER OFF HER FEET 
ALAN OH ALAN HAD A TERRIBLE TIME 
KNOCK IT OFF EH FELLAS 
HE WAS ACTUALLY IN LOVE WITH TINTIN 
THEY'RE JUST FRIENDS THAT'S ALL 
THERE WAS A LOVELY NATURALNESS TO IT I THOUGHT WITH THAT RELATIONSHIP 
WAS HE AS HANDSOME AS I AM GORDON NEARLY VIRGIL 
THEY'RE OVERGROWN KIDS WE NEVER FORGET THAT THEY'RE CHILDREN 
BECAUSE THEIR DAD IS TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO 
A MOMENT'S DELAY COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH 
THESE KIDS ARE BEING TOLD TO GO OFF AND PILOT FANTASTICALLY FAST MACHINES 
AND GO OUT AND DO EXCITING THINGS IT'S ABSOLUTE CHILD WISH FULFILMENT 
KIDS EMPATHISED A LOT WITH THUNDERBIRDS 
BECAUSE THE CHARACTERS' HEADS ARE OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE BODY 
JUST LIKE CHILDREN 
I WAS ABOUT SEVEN YEARS OLD AND WE HAD A FAMILY HOLIDAY TO MORECAMBE 
AND THEN I REALISED THEY HAD THIS THIRTY F. T. MODEL OF THUNDERBIRD THREE 
I RESOLVED THEN TO ACTUALLY BUILD MY OWN ROCKET 
I WAS GONNA BUILD ONE OF THESE THINGS 
THAT CHARGED THE IMAGINATION 
A LOT OF KIDS GROW UP AND THEY BELIEVE IN MAGIC 
THEY BELIEVE IN ALL THIS HARRY POTTER STUFF 
I WANTED SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL 
I THOUGHT THROUGH SCIENCE YOU CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN AND VERY MUCH SO WITH THUNDERBIRDS 
IT COULD BE POSSIBLE AND IT COULD YOU KNOW 
GIVE ME A FEW BILLION POUNDS AND I COULD BUILD YOU A TRACY ISLAND 
AND WE COULD DO THUNDERBIRDS FOR REAL 
I HAD A LITTLE THUNDERBIRD TWO A DINKY THUNDERBIRD TWO WHERE THE POD CAME OUT 
YEAH I HAD ONE OF THOSE 
THUNDERBIRD FOUR THAT YOU ALWAYS LOSE 
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND I HAD A FAB ONE THE ROLLS ROYCE 
AND YOU ALWAYS USED TO LOSE THE GUN 
COS IT USED TO FIRE A GUN OUT THE FRONT 
I DIDN'T REALISE WHEN I WAS A KID 
THAT MOST OF THE THUNDERBIRDS MACHINERY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE 
COS WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS YOU'VE GOT THESE THREE ENGINES HERE 
AND IF YOU'VE GOT A SLIGHT IMBALANCE FROM ONE OF THESE ENGINES 
IT'S JUST GONNA TIP THE ROCKET 
IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF YOU HAD FOUR ENGINES 
YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF GUIDANCE ON THERE 
MAYBE A REACTION CONTROL SYSTEM OUT THE FRONT 
TO MITIGATE ANY VARIATIONS IN THE THRUST 
YOU KNOW A ROCKET LAUNCHING NEVER FAILS TO GIVE ME A KICK 
IT'S THE HARDWARE THE GADGETS THE MACHINES 
ITS WISH FULFILMENT REALLY FOR BOYS 
WHERE ARE WE NOW THESE ARE SOME OF THE VEHICLES THAT WE USE 
WHEN WE'RE OUT ON RESCUE OPERATIONS 
OF COURSE THESE ARE JUST SOME OF OUR MINOR CRAFT 
THIS WAS MY FAVOURITE THUNDERBIRD 
IT HAD SO MUCH GOING ON 
BUT IT WOULD BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THIS TO FLY 
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THESE WINGS 
THEY JUST POINT THE WRONG WAY 
EASY DOES IT 
HE'S DOWN 
AS SIXTY FIVE MOVED INTO SIXTY SIX THUNDERBIRDS WAS ONE OF I. T. V.'S BIGGEST SHOWS 
AND A MULTI MILLION POUND BUSINESS EMPIRE 
IT CREATED THE FIRST MUST HAVE TOYS 
COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE PRODUCTS EVEN POPPED UP IN THE SHOW ITSELF 
AN EARLY EXAMPLE OF PRODUCT PLACEMENT 
NOW THAT'S A GOOD CHOICE 
MERCHANDISE AND MAGAZINES WERE BIG BUSINESS AMONG BOYS 
THE NEXT JOB WAS TO FIND A WAY OF REACHING GIRLS 
BY EXPLOITING A MINOR CHARACTER 
INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COME IN PLEASE 
COME IN PENNY 
THEY DECIDED THEY'D DEVOTE A WHOLE MAGAZINE TO LADY PENELOPE 
SO WE HAD A CALL A DESPERATE CALL SAYING 
LOOK WE'VE INVESTED MONEY WHERE IS THE HEROINE 
WE ONLY SEE HER AT THE BEGINNING AND THE END 
BUT THIS WAS A BOYS' WORLD WHERE GIRLS HAD TO USE ALL THEIR FEMININE WILES 
OH CONSTABLE THE LIGHT'S IN MY EYES 
THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT WHEN THE TEAM OF WRITERS CAME IN 
THEY NEVER KNEW HOW TO WRITE FOR THIS NEW HEROINE 
SO IT WAS ALL BOY'S OWN STUFF 
AND THE WOMEN SORT OF BRINGING THE TEA 
NOW I SEEM TO BE QUITE LOST 
WHERE ARE YOU MAKING FOR 
WELL IF YOU COULD DIRECT ME TO THE TOWER OF LONDON 
I ALWAYS HAD A BATTLE ON MY HANDS REALLY 
TO GET SOMETHING INTO THE SHOW THAT WAS MORE THAN EXPLOSIONS 
IT TOOK QUITE A LOT OF PERSUASION 
BOWING TO COMMERCIAL PRESSURE 
PENELOPE AND PARKER WERE BROUGHT FORWARD IN THE STORYLINES 
ADDING A DASH OF LIGHT RELIEF AS WELL AS GLAMOUR 
JUST A TOUCH OF CHLOROFORM SPLENDID 
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SERIES 
PARKER WAS ACTUALLY A MINOR CHARACTER 
BECAUSE IN THE CREDITS AT THE END HIS FACE DOESN'T APPEAR 
LIKE SCOTT'S AND ALL THE OTHERS 
YOU'VE GOT THE LADY OF THE MANOR AND YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW 
AN EX CONVICT TRYING TO GO STRAIGHT 
PARKER 
YES MILADY 
AND SASSING HER ALL THE TIME 
I JUST THINK THE JUXTAPOSITION OF THE TWO WAS MADE FOR COMEDY 
GET THE ROLLS ROYCE OUT PARKER 
WE'RE TAKING LORD SILTON TO LONDON 
BUT AS WRITERS GOT TO GRIPS WITH LADY P. 
SHE BEGAN TO DEVELOP FROM COMEDY SUB PLOT 
TO FULLY FLEDGED ACTION HEROINE 
YOU KNOW I'VE OFTEN FELT I'D LIKE TO DO SOMETHING EXCITING 
LIKE BEING A SECRET AGENT 
WHEN LADY PENELOPE AND PARKER ARE LEADING THE STORYLINE 
THE STORIES BECOME ALMOST MORE ESPIONAGE SECRET AGENT BASED 
OBVIOUSLY AT THIS TIME THE SIXTIES SECRET AGENTS WERE HUGELY POPULAR 
FROM PEOPLE WHO HAD WEALTH AND CLASS 
GETTING INVOLVED IN DANGEROUS OPERATIONS 
AND LADY PENELOPE AND PARKER ARE PART OF THAT WORLD 
WHY PENELOPE ARE YOU ALL RIGHT 
OH AT LAST 
THOSE KILLERS ARE HIDING OUT IN THEIR SUB THEY MUST BE STOPPED 
THERE'S A SENSE THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO GET INTO THAT WHOLE JAMES BOND SCENE NOT ALWAYS THAT SUBTLY 
THERE'S A CHARACTER IN AN EPISODE CALLED THE MAN FROM M. I FIVE CALLED JAMES BONDSON 
DEAR ME YOU ARE IMPATIENT MR. BONDSON 
SHE'S A SORT OF ROGUE DEB A MODERN POSH GIRL 
A VERY RICH MODERN POSH GIRL 
SHE'S A SORT OF COMPOSITE OF ALL THE EARLY SLASH MID SIXTIES GIRLS 
ACTRESSES AND POP PEOPLE 
SHE'S A BIT JULIE CHRISTIE A BIT DUSTY SPRINGFIELD 
SHE'S THAT COMPOSITE SIXTIES GIRL WITH BIG BLONDE HAIR 
AND FANTASTICALLY SMART CLOTHES COUTURE BUT NEW COUTURE 
THIS IS NUMBER SEVENTEEN CALLED AUTUMN CROCUS 
THEY WERE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT REAL COUTURE 
AND COPYING THOSE CLOTHES 
PENELOPE'S GLAMOUROUS LIFESTYLE AND STIFF UPPER LIP 
PERFECTLY SUITED THE MOOD OF SWINGING LONDON 
OR PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION OF IT ANYWAY 
WE'RE NEARLY THERE 
THEYE ABSOLUTELY SUBSCRIBED TO AN AMERICAN VIEW OF BRITISHNESS 
WHY BOTHER WITH SUBTLETIES IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
IT WOULD BE STUPID SO YOU'VE GOT POSH UPRIGHT BRITS 
I SAY OPEN THIS DOOR AT ONCE WE'RE BRITISH 
AND THE DICK VAN DYKES YOU KNOW WORKING CLASSES 
JOLLY GOOD SHOW 
AND POSH LADIES 
PARKER WILL HAVE US OUT OF HERE IN NO TIME 
LONDON MAY HAVE BEEN SWINGING 
BUT BACK IN SLOUGH THE THUNDERBIRDS TEAM WERE HARD AT WORK 
AND SO ANOTHER SCENE IN THE ADVENTURES OF INTERNATIONAL RESCUE 
IS SHOT AT THE A. P. FILM STUDIOS IN SLOUGH THE SAFETY TOWN 
ON THE SLOUGH TRADING ESTATE 
WE PROBABLY LAUNCHED MORE ROCKETS THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD 
DEREK HOW DO YOU EVOLVE THE FUTURISTIC DESIGNS OF YOUR MODELS 
WELL USUALLY I JUST START DOODLING ON A PAD 
AS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE IN SPECIAL EFFECTS 
IT'S MADE BY PEOPLE CALLED REG AND DEREK 
AND YET IT'S DELIBERATELY PROJECTING 
A COMPLETELY UN ENGLISH UN SLOUGH KIND OF WORLD 
ALL SORTS OF GLAMOUROUS THINGS ARE MADE IN UNGLAMOROUS PLACES 
AND THEREFORE EXACTLY THE RIGHT PLACE TO MAKE MAGIC 
A DREAM FACTORY SHOULD BE IN SLOUGH 
THEY WERE ON THE BELOVED SLOUGH TRADING ESTATE 
A VERY ROMANTIC SETTING NOT FAR FROM THE MARS CHOCOLATE FACTORY 
AND IN THE SHADOW OF TWO COOLING TOWERS 
NOT QUITE HOLLYWOOD BUT THE NEAREST THING WE'D GOT 
NEXT STAGE THERE'S A VAST EMPIRE OF SCENIC DESIGN AND MODEL MAKING 
EVERYTHING IS CUSTOM DESIGNED AND BUILT TO SCALE HOUSES SPACE PORTS 
THUNDERBIRD CRAFT VEHICLES DOWN TO GUNS AND WATCHES' 
WE HAD EVERYTHING THAT ANY OTHER FILM WOULD HAVE 
THERE WAS A CARPENTER'S WORKSHOP A PUPPET WORKSHOP 
THERE WAS A WARDROBE DEPARTMENT AN EDITING DEPARTMENT 
IT WAS A MINIATURE FILM STUDIO 
A MINIATURE INDUSTRY IF YOU LIKE 
WE HAD EVERYTHING THAT ANYONE ELSE WOULD USE WHEN MAKING A FILM 
WE DID TRY TO KEEP IT WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF WHAT YOU COULD DO 
WITH SHEETS OF PERSPEX AND BITS OF CARDBOARD AND BITS OF WOOD 
AND THEN THE TRICK WAS TO TRY AND STOP IT LOOKING LIKE SOMETHING 
THAT SOMEONE WOULD STAB A FINGER AT THE SCREEN AND SAY 
THAT'S AN ICE BUCKET FROM WOOLWORTHS OR WHATEVER 
THAT WAS WHERE THE SKILL LAY AND HOPEFULLY SOME OF THE TIME WE GOT AWAY WITH IT 
NOW I LOOK AT SOME OF THE SETS AND THINK WHY DID WE DO THAT 
THERE'S AN ENORMOUS LEMON SQUEEZER ON THE THUNDERBIRD ONE HANGAR 
IN A VERY PROMINENT POSITION 
AND I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY WE LEFT IT THERE 
I WINCE EVERY TIME I SEE IT 
WHEN YOU WERE A BOY WERE YOU FASCINATED BY EXPLOSIONS 
YEAH I'M VERY DESTRUCTIVE BY NATURE 
I THINK THAT'S WHY I'M IN SPECIAL EFFECTS 
IT WAS FILMED IN THE AFTERNOON AND BLOWN UP 
IF IT DIDN'T WORK THE NEXT MORNING WHEN YOU WATCHED THE RUSHES 
YOU MADE IT ALL AGAIN THAT WAS THE ROUTINE 
IT WASN'T UNTIL YOU WATCHED THE RUSHES 
COULD YOU BREATHE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND SAY 
RIGHT I HAVEN'T GOT TO REBUILD THAT LORRY THAT WAS BURNT TO PIECES 
OR THE PETROL STATION THAT WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED 
WE HADN'T HAD THE TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU HAVE TODAY 
WE HAD NOTHING BUT BITS OF STRING TO PULL THINGS ALONG 
BITS OF WIRES TO HANG THINGS ON 
SO WE WEREN'T MISSING THE MAGIC THAT TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY HAS 
BUT IT WAS MORE FUN THEN 
SHE'S GOING 
OOH THOSE EFFECTS BOYS MUST HAVE FELT 
LIKE THEY HAD THE BIGGEST TRAIN SET IN THE WORLD TO PLAY WITH 
NOTHING WAS IMPOSSIBLE 
APART FROM MAKING THE PUPPETS WALK OF COURSE 
IT DID LEAD TO SUCH THINGS AS THE JET BIKES THAT THE THUNDERBIRD CREWS HAD 
WHICH OBVIOUSLY WAS A SOLUTION 
IT LOOKED VERY FUTURISTIC 
AND WE MAY WELL HAVE HAD THEM IN THE SCRIPT ANYWAY 
BUT CERTAINLY FACED WITH THE PROBLEM 
OF GETTING A PUPPET TO CROSS A SET FROM POINT A TO POINT B. 
AND GET THEM AT SPEED AS WELL WHICH WAS THE OTHER THING 
THEN THE JET BIKE WAS THE OBVIOUS ANSWER 
RIGHT MCGILL 
HE GAVE THEM A HOVER BIKE OR A VEHICLE TO GO AROUND IN 
BUT THAT'S WHAT MADE IT BETTER SO ECONOMY BECOMES A KIND OF A PLUS 
YOU COULD NEVER GET A PUPPET TO PICK SOMETHING UP 
SO WE'D USE REAL HANDS A LOT OF THE TIME MINE 
IT'S NOT HERE 
WE'D BUILD A LITTLE PIECE OF SET FOR A REAL HAND 
YOU NEED HANDS TO HOLD SOMEONE YOU CARE FOR 
YOU NEED HANDS TO SHOW THAT YOU'RE SINCERE 
WHEN YOU FEEL NOBODY WANTS TO KNOW YOU 
THE RENDEZVOUS REMAINS AS ARRANGED 
DIDN'T YOU HEAR THE FIRST TIME STOP PLAYING AROUND WITH THAT PEN 
LISTEN DEMPSEY I'M HANGED IF I'M GONNA TAKE ORDERS FROM YOU 
IN MARCH SIXTY SIXTH THE PUPPETS FACED THEIR GREATEST CHALLENGE 
AGAINST REAL LIVE ALLIGATORS 
WE DID HAVE LIVE ALLIGATORS 
WE HAD A MASSIVE TANK BUILT INTO OUR STAGE 
AND WE BUILT THE HOUSE THAT WAS GONNA GET BLOWN UP 
AND WE GOT THESE ALLIGATORS 
THEY'D SWIM ROUND DISAPPEAR AND GO UNDER THE WATER 
THAT'S WHEN YOU GOT OUT OF THE TANK 
THE MAN FROM THE R. S. P. C. A. WENT 
RIGHT WHAT'S THIS ABOUT YOU GIVING THEM ELECTRIC SHOCKS 
DEREK SAID WELL THEY WON'T MOVE 
I PUT THEM DOWN AND THEY JUST WON'T MOVE 
SO WE JUST TOUCHED THEM WITH TWO ELECTRODES AND IT MAKES THEM MOVE BUT NOT VERY MUCH 
SO HE SAID WHAT VOLTAGE ARE YOU USING 
DEREK SAID ONLY TWELVE VOLTS 
HE SAID TWELVE VOLTS 
THESE ANIMALS HAVE GOT VERY THICK SKINS TRY TURNING IT UP TO SIXTY 
WHICH HE DID 
COME ON COME AND GET ME 
ALAN 
GOOD SHOOTING FELLAS 
IT WAS WONDERFUL WE LEARNT THE BUSINESS 
I WENT THERE NOT HAVING A CLUE HOW A FILM WAS PUT TOGETHER 
AND I LEARNT AS WE ALL DID 
WE WERE ALL VERY YOUNG NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR OLDS 
AND WE WERE ALL BROUGHT TOGETHER TO PLAY REALLY AND WE WERE PLAYING 
IT WAS AMAZING 
SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE IN THEIR INFANCY 
AND WE WERE YEARS AHEAD OF ANYBODY ELSE 
THIS LITTLE STUDIO IN SLOUGH 
WAS PRODUCING SOME OF THE FINEST SPECIAL EFFECTS IN THE WORLD 
AS ENGLAND LIFTED THE WORLD CUP 
THUNDERBIRDS WAS THE NUMBER ONE CHILDREN'S SHOW 
LEW GRADE'S NEXT PLAN WAS TO MOVE TO THE BIG SCREEN 
ADVENTURE IS GO 
DANGER IS GO 
THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO 
NOW ON THE BIG SCREEN 
TO MAKE A MOVIE OF THUNDERBIRDS THEN IN SIXTY SIX 
WAS NO COINCIDENCE BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT SIXTY FIVE SIXTY SIX 
THAT INTEREST IN BRITISH FILMS AND BRITISHNESS IN THE CINEMA 
REALLY REACHES ITS PEAK 
IT'S IN SIXTY FIVE SIXTY SIX THAT BONDMANIA REACHES ITS ABSOLUTE HIGHEST EXTENT 
WITH THE RELEASE OF THUNDERBALL 
THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO WAS SET TO BE THE CHRISTMAS FILM OF NINETEEN SIXTY SIX 
WITH A SPECTACULAR PREMIERE IN LONDON'S WEST END 
IF ANYONE SAYS TO ME AN OUTSTANDING MEMORY OF THOSE TIMES 
IT WOULD BE THE PREMIERE OF THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO 
VERY VERY EXCITING WE HAD A HUGE BAND 
WE HAD EVERYBODY VISITING 
AND THE FANS IT WAS JUST WONDERFUL 
IT WAS NICE TO BE HAVING THAT KIND OF SLIGHTLY LAVISH THING 
TO CELEBRATE THE FILM ITSELF 
IT DID US A POWER OF GOOD I THINK 
THERE WAS FLOODLIGHTS IN PICCADILLY CIRCUS IT WAS WONDERFUL 
THEN THEY HAD THE BAND OF THE ROYAL MARINES ON STAGE YOU KNOW 
PLAYING THE THUNDERBIRDS THEME 
I THINK I WORE A DINNER JACKET 
WE FELT THAT WE'D ARRIVED WE DID IT PROPERLY 
IT WAS RIGHT IN THE WEST END OF LONDON IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN BETTER 
AND IT WAS A PROPER FILM PREMIERE BUT THEY WERE PUPPETS 
IN THE FOYER I STOOD BESIDE LEW 
AND THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID GERRY I CAN'T MAKE UP MY MIND 
IS THUNDERBIRDS GONNA BE BIGGER THAN JAMES BOND 
WELL YOU KNOW IT WAS LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE 
A BRAND NEW ADVENTURE THAT TAKES YOU WHERE YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BEFORE 
THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO 
UNFORTUNATELY THE PICTURE FAILED 
PEOPLE LOOK BACK AT THAT FILM AND SAY 
WELL THAT WAS THE TURNING POINT FOR ANDERSON'S CAREER 
IT'S NEW ZOOM FROM LYONS MAID 
NEW ZOOM WITH THREE FLAVOUR STAGES AND NEW PICTURE CARDS 
START COLLECTING FAMOUS CARS 
THERE'S ONE FREE WITH EVERY ZOOM ON SALE NOW 
BY CHRISTMAS NINETEEN SIXTY SIX THUNDERBIRDS HAD CONQUERED THE WORLD 
BUT UNEXPECTEDLY THE BIG SCREEN VERSION FLOPPED 
IT WAS MIDWAY THROUGH THE SECOND SEASON 
AFTER THIRTY TWO FANTASTIC ADVENTURES 
THAT GERRY GOT THE NEWS THAT THE PLUG WAS BEING PULLED 
I WENT TO LEW I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT 
I WAS SURE HE WAS GONNA SAY 
THERE'S LITTLE TO SAY GERRY JUST KEEP ON MAKING THEM 
INSTEAD OF WHICH HE SAID 
IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR ME TO SELL IF I HAD A NEW SERIES 
HE FELT HE COULDN'T SELL MORE EPISODES 
I THINK HE WAS WRONG BUT I ALLOW HIM THAT 
HE SAID THERE WAS GONNA BE ANOTHER SERIES AND IT WAS GONNA BE BETTER 
WE THOUGHT WELL HANG ON A MINUTE 
THUNDERBIRDS WENT TO THE TOP HOW CAN YOU DO BETTER THAN THAT 
THE FINGER IS ON THE TRIGGER 
ABOUT TO UNLEASH A FORCE WITH TERRIBLE POWERS 
BEYOND THE COMPREHENSION OF MAN 
I THINK BY SIXTY SEVEN THINGS WERE DEFINITELY STARTING TO CHANGE 
THE NEWSWEEK ARTICLE ON LONDON CAME OUT IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX 
WE WERE DUBBED SWINGING LONDON 
THE MOMENT THEY DID IT THAT WAS SORT OF THE END 
THE FOLLOWING YEAR THINGS TURNED FROM THAT MOOD WHICH WAS POP 
TO PSYCHEDELIC AND SWIRLY WHIRLY HORRIBLE HIPPIEDOM 
THE NEW SERIES ALSO REFLECTED A CHANGE OF MOOD 
THE TONE IS SET BY THE OPENING CREDITS 
WHEN YOU SEE CAPTAIN BLACK STANDING IN THE GRAVEYARD AT NIGHT 
A FRIEND OF MINE WHO'S NOW FORTY SOMETHING 
USED TO QUAKE BEHIND THE SETTEE WHENEVER CAPTAIN BLACK SAID ANYTHING 
IT WAS JUST THAT SORT OF FRIGHTENING VOICE 
ONE OF YOU WILL BE UNDER OUR CONTROL 
THAT REALLY DIDN'T COME OUT IN THUNDERBIRDS 
OUR RETALIATION WILL MEAN 
THE ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION OF LIFE ON EARTH 
THUNDERBIRDS IS ABOUT SAVING PEOPLE FROM THEMSELVES ALMOST 
BECAUSE IT'S PEOPLE WHO'VE GOTTEN INTO TROUBLE 
LARGELY THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN 
CAPTAIN SCARLET IS VERY MUCH ABOUT A THREAT 
IT WAS A DARKER SHOW MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE STORY 
THE PLANET IS BEING THREATENED BY THESE INVISIBLE ALIENS 
WHO CAN BE ANYWHERE WHO CAN DO ANYTHING 
THERE WAS SOMETHING REALLY QUITE CHILLING 
ABOUT THE WAY THAT THEY DID IT 
YOU KNEW THAT PERSON'S GONNA BE RESURRECTED 
BUT WITH HIS MIND PERVERTED AND TURNED AGAINST THE HUMAN CAUSE 
THESE ARE QUITE HEAVY THINGS TO LAY ON YOUNG MINDS 
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN USED TO THE JOLLY ROUSING MARCH OF THUNDERBIRDS 
AND THE IDEA THAT ANYBODY COULD BE TAKEN OVER BY A MYSTERON 
IT'S THE BODY SNATCHERS IDEA 
WHICH IS PROBABLY THE SCARIEST OF ALL SCI FI CONCEPTS REALLY 
ALL THE HUMOUR ALL THE LIGHT RELIEF 
ALL THE QUIRKY CHARM OF THE CHARACTERS HAS GONE 
AND WE'VE GOT THIS INCREDIBLY SERIOUS 
VERY GRAVE AND VERY DARK WORLD 
THE ADVANCE OF TECHNOLOGY CONTINUED 
THE NEW SHOW TOOK GERRY ONE STEP NEARER 
TO HIS DREAM OF CREATING LIVE ACTION 
PHYSICALLY THE PUPPETS CHANGED 
THEY COULD NOW PUT THE MECHANISM INTO THE BODY 
SO THAT THE MOUTHS WORKED AND THE EYES ROLLED 
SO THE PUPPETS LOOKED LIKE MUCH MORE HUMAN 
THEY NEEDED TO LOOK THAT MUCH MORE REAL FOR THE STORY TO WORK 
THE PUPPETS ON THUNDERBIRDS WERE MARIONETTES 
WE STARTED TO MOVE TOWARDS LIVE ACTION 
WITH THE CAPTAIN SCARLET PUPPETS 
THE HEADS WERE MUCH SMALLER 
I WAS VERY PLEASED PROBABLY NAIVELY 
BECAUSE THEY LOOKED LIKE REAL PEOPLE FOR THE FIRST TIME 
BUT THEY CREATED VERY REAL PROBLEMS 
BECAUSE THE HEAD HAD TO BE MUCH SMALLER 
THE MODELLING WAS MORE DIFFICULT 
YOU COULDN'T PUT SO MUCH CHARACTER INTO THE FACE 
BECAUSE IT WAS SO SMALL 
IT WASN'T UNTIL YOU LOOK BACK YOU STAND BACK AND LOOK AT IT AND THINK 
H. M. M. I PREFER THE BIGGER HEADS 
ALTHOUGH THEY LOOK MORE REAL 
IN A WAY THEY FEEL LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT FLESHED OUT WITH A PRIVATE LIFE 
LIEUTENANT GREEN I'M OUTSIDE THE NASH INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY 
I WAS JUST ASKED TO DO THIS 
SIG CAPTAIN BLUE IT'S CAPTAIN SCARLET SPEAKING I'M ON MY WAY 
THAT KIND OF THING 
PROCEED CAPTAIN SCARLET 
I JUST DID MY VOICE I DIDN'T REALLY THINK ABOUT HIS CHARACTER 
THERE'S NOT AN AWFUL LOT TO DIFFERENTIATE THEM APART FROM THEIR COLOURS 
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ACTING IT PHYSICALLY 
AS AN ACTOR YOU TRY TO JUST GIVE YOUR VOICE AS MUCH TENSION 
DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION AS YOU CAN 
COVER ME WITH THE SPB ROCKET I'M GOING UP THERE AFTER HIM 
BUT AS FAR AS CHARACTERISING ALL I DID WAS THAT VOICE 
IT'S NOT A VOICE THAT YOU CAN DO MANY DEPTHS WITH 
TAKE IT EASY SIG 
BUT PEOPLE LIKED IT 
AH OH 
THE NEXT SERIES WAS IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT 
JOE NINETY WAS AIMED MORE SQUARELY AT CHILDREN 
WITH A NINE YEAR OLD BOY AT THE HEART OF THE ACTION 
YES DAD I CAN'T WAIT TO GET TO THE BEACH 
THE PUPPETS WERE CERTAINLY LOOKING MORE LIFELIKE THAN THEY HAD 
JUST SIX YEARS EARLIER 
HAVE A NICE DAY SIR 
BUT GERRY WAS STILL LONGING TO WORK WITH LIVE ACTORS 
SO HIS NEXT OFFERING WAS A BIZARRE MIX OF PUPPETS AND PEOPLE 
GOOD MORNING AH GOOD MORNING 
LEW CALLED ME INTO HIS OFFICE AND SAID APOLOGETICALLY 
GERRY UM I DON'T REALLY THINK WE CAN GO ANY FURTHER WITH PUPPETS 
I THINK YOU'D BETTER SWITCH TO LIVE ACTION 
I MANAGED TO KEEP A VERY SERIOUS FACE AND SAID 
WELL IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO 
AS I CLOSED THE DOOR I WENT WOW 
THAT'S HOW I SWITCHED TO LIVE ACTION 
WE ALL WANTED TO WORK WITH REAL PEOPLE 
WE ALL WANTED TO DO LIVE ACTION WE ALL WANTED TO DO LIFE SIZE SETS 
THEY WERE FULL SIZE SETS AND IT WAS FILLED WITH PEOPLE WHO COULD WALK 
AND PEOPLE WHO COULD LOOK AT THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WHEN THEY SPOKE 
THEIR MOUTHS OPENED AND CLOSED IN SYNC WITH THEIR DIALOGUE 
INTERCEPTORS IMMEDIATE LAUNCH 
EVERYTHING WAS WONDERFUL AND SO EASY BY COMPARISON 
SO I WAS ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED WITH IT 
IT WAS A GROWN UP WORLD AND GERRY AND HIS CREW WERE OVER THE MOON 
MEANWHILE ANOTHER DREAM HAD BEEN REALISED 
IT'S ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN 
ONE GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND 
BEFORE THE MOON LANDING WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE 
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME WE'D EVER SEEN 
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE SPACE IT WAS ACTUALLY RATHER DULL 
SO IN THE SEARCH FOR ADVENTURE THE ONLY OPTION 
WAS TO SEND THE MOON ITSELF INTO THE OUTER REACHES OF THE UNIVERSE 
IT WAS WONDERFUL TO WORK WITH REAL ACTORS PARTICULARLY ON SPACE NINETEEN NINETY NINE 
WE HAD GUEST STARS THAT YOU WOULD DIE FOR 
I REMEMBER HAVING TO DESIGN AN OUTFIT FOR JOAN COLLINS 
IN THE RADIOACTIVE WILDERNESS 
UNBELIEVABLE 
WHEN I LOOK AT THE DESIGN IT'S NAFF TO SAY THE LEAST 
BUT AT THE TIME IT WASN'T 
SHE WAS INCREDIBLE 
I'VE NEVER SEEN A WOMAN SO BEAUTIFUL 
HER LEGS WERE EXTRAORDINARY 
I MEAN THIS WAS REALLY EXCITING THIS WAS FILM MAKING 
A MILLION YEARS OF CIVILISATION GONE 
WHAT FUTURE DO WE HAVE NOW 
SPACE NINETEEN NINETY NINE ENDED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN 
BY WHICH TIME GERRY AND SYLVIA HAD SPLIT UP 
AND THEIR CREW HAD FLOWN THE NEST 
OUT MAKING THEIR MARK ON THE BIG WIDE WORLD 
MEMBERS OF THAT TEAM WENT ON TO BECOME SOME OF THE WORLD'S LEADING SPECIAL EFFECTS MEN 
HEAD OF B. B. C. SPECIAL EFFECTS FOR YEARS 
SPECIAL EFFECTS ON ALIEN SPECIAL EFFECTS ON INDIANA JONES 
THEY'RE ALL KIDS FROM THUNDERBIRDS BASICALLY 
THE BOY WHO LOVED BLOWING THINGS UP DEREK MEDDINGS 
CREATED LIFE SIZE SETS FOR FIVE BOND FILMS 
FINAL REHEARSAL STAND BY 
AND IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WAS AWARDED A SPECIAL ACHIEVEMENT OSCAR FOR HIS WORK ON SUPERMAN 
WE HAD QUITE A GOOD REPUTATION 
WHEN IT FIRST STARTED IT WAS ALWAYS OH THOSE LITTLE PUPPETS 
AND IT GOT BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER 
YEAH I WAS QUITE PROUD OF THEM 
IT SEEMED THAT THUNDERBIRDS HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND 
IN THE LONG LOST WORLD OF THE SIXTIES 
BUT THE CHILDHOOD MEMORIES WERE STILL STRONG 
YOU COULDN'T WATCH THEM ON VIDEO OR BUY THE D. V. D. 
WE WERE IN A BAR JUST FALLING ABOUT THINKING ABOUT THE PALM TREES 
RIDICULOUS WHY DIDN'T THEY PLANT THEM FURTHER OUT 
WHY DO THEM SO THEY HAD TO MOVE AND HOW GREAT THE ROCKETS WERE 
WE THOUGHT MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE WOULD SHARE THAT EXCITEMENT 
HI PENNY JEFF HERE THE PRESIDENT'S IN GRAVE DANGER 
CAN YOU LOOK INTO IT 
VIRGIL LET'S GO FAB 
AFTER THAT WE THOUGHT MAYBE IF WE THINK THAT'S FUNNY 
AND THERE'S A KIND OF NOSTALGIA FOR IT MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE WILL 
WHAT WE'VE TAKEN IS TAKEN THAT STYLE OF THE PUPPET MOVEMENT 
WE ACTUALLY DO THAT PUPPET MOVEMENT ON STAGE 
I SUPPOSE IT'S A SEND UP ALMOST BECAUSE WE DO IT SERIOUSLY 
THAT'S IT I DID IT 
A BRAND N. NEW FORMULA 
WE HAVE THREE FOOT MODELS OF THUNDERBIRD ONE AND THUNDERBIRD TWO WHICH WE WEAR ON OUR HEADS 
IT WAS ALMOST A CULT HIT INSTANTLY 
I DON'T THINK WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS THAT NOSTALGIA 
UNTIL WE'D MADE THE SHOW 
IT VERY QUICKLY BECAME APPARENT THAT OTHER PEOPLE SHARED IT 
AFTER FIVE YEARS THE FAB SHOW MOVED TO LONDON'S WEST END 
THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO 
WE LOVED IT WE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS RUBBISH 
IT WOULD BE EASY TO DO THE TERRIBLE SPOOF VERSION OF THUNDERBIRDS OH THE STRINGS 
BUT ACTUALLY IT WAS GREAT AND WE HAD A GREAT AFFECTION FOR IT 
BY THE EARLY NINETIES 
EVEN B. B. C. BOSSES HAD REALISED THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON HERE 
TONIGHT AT SIX O'CLOCK THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO ONCE AGAIN 
AS B. B. C. TWO BEGINS A RE RUN OF THE CLASSIC PUPPET SERIES 
THERE IT WAS THE ORIGINAL EPISODES BACK ON B. B. C. TWO 
WHICH I THINK WAS THE FIRST TIME IT HAD BEEN ON IN TWENTY YEARS 
IN A WAY SOMEHOW I FEEL THAT THE BEGINNING OF NOSTALGIC TELEVISION ACTUALLY STARTED THERE 
AND THEN ALL THE PROGRAMMES SINCE ABOUT ALL THE OTHER NOSTALGIA 
IT FEELS LIKE IT STARTED AROUND THERE 
A REVIVAL OF INTEREST IN THUNDERBIRDS WAS FUELLED BY RECENT RE RUNS OF THE SERIES BY THE B. B. C. 
LAST CHRISTMAS SHOPS RAN OUT OF MODELS OF TRACY ISLAND AS DEMAND OUTSTRIPPED SUPPLY 
NOW THEN LAUNCH PAD THREE 
FIRST MAKE A SURROUND WHICH IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ONE FOR YOUR POOL 
AFTER IT CAME BACK WE NOTICED MORE CHILDREN 
THEY JUST GOT YOUNGER AND YOUNGER I GUESS THAT'S NATURAL 
IT WAS ALWAYS A SERIES FOR CHILDREN DADS NOW BROUGHT THEIR SONS 
SO OF COURSE THE SHOW TOOK ON A DIFFERENT LIFE 
ON OUR WAY MADAM 
AND ANOTHER FAMILY FAVOURITE 
ALSO TOOK A LEAF OUT OF THE THUNDERBIRDS HANDBOOK 
I WAS SENDING UP THAT THING ESPECIALLY IN A CLOSE SHAVE 
WHERE WALLACE GOES UP IN A CHAIR AND DOWN THE SHOOTS AND EVERYTHING 
HE GETS CLOTHED AUTOMATICALLY 
AND GROMIT JUST WALKS IN THROUGH THE DOOR 
IT'S AN AFFECTIONATE NOD REALLY TOWARDS ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF 
THESE DAYS THE CHILDREN OF THE MID SIXTIES 
REALLY ARE LIVING IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
AND SOME OF THEM ARE OUT THERE DESIGNING SPACE STATIONS 
BIG CARS AND CITIES OF THE FUTURE 
AND LOOK WHAT FATHER CHRISTMAS BROUGHT ONE THUNDERBIRDS FAN 
I WANTED TO BE SCOTT TRACY I WANTED TO FLY INTO SPACE YOU KNOW 
THAT WAS I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING ME TO DO THIS 
I'M ACTUALLY DOING THIS PROJECT BECAUSE I LOVE IT 
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A CALLING TO ME 
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TECHNOLOGY HAS ALSO ALLOWED THUNDERBIRDS 
TO TAKE ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN 
THROUGH AN INVENTION THAT EVEN GERRY COULDN'T HAVE FORESEEN 
THE WHOLE APPRECIATION OF GERRY'S WORK IS GENERATIONAL 
THE CHILDREN THAT APPRECIATED IT IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES GREW UP AND HAD CHILDREN 
AND THEN THE CHILDREN SAW THE REPEATS 
AND BECAME FANS IN THEIR TURN 
GOOD KING WENCESLAS LOOKED OUT 
YOU GO TO THESE CONVENTIONS WITH ALL SORTS OF THINGS GOING ON 
AND FATHERS WILL BRING THEIR KIDS 
FATHERS BROUGHT UP ON THUNDERBIRDS NOW BRINGING THEIR KIDS ALONG 
THERE'S A GOOD MESSAGE THERE IN THUNDERBIRDS 
ABOUT SAVING PEOPLE HELPING PEOPLE 
AND THAT IS PROBABLY WHY THAT IS THE ONE SHOW 
THAT HAS SURVIVED ALL OF THE OTHERS SO MUCH BETTER 
BECAUSE OF THAT MESSAGE 
TINTIN LOOK 
OH IT'S SNOWING 
I THINK IT'S INSPIRATIONAL AND THERE'S NOT A NAIVETY EXACTLY 
BUT AN INNOCENCE ABOUT THEM THAT AGAIN REFLECTS THE TIME I SUPPOSE 
I FIND THAT VERY CHARMING I THINK CHILDREN STILL RELATE TO THAT 
CERTAINLY MY SON WHO'S ELEVEN 
CAN STILL WATCH IT AND THERE'S NO SIDE ISSUE TO IT 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
I WAS NINETEEN WORKING IN THE STUDIO IN SLOUGH 
AND IN THE MID SIXTIES IT WAS GREAT TO BE NINETEEN IN BRITAIN 
THE BEATLES WERE NUMBER ONE ALL OVER THE WORLD 
ENGLAND HAD JUST BEATEN GERMANY IN THE WORLD CUP 
AND TO BE WORKING ON SUCH A HIGHLY CREATIVE 
HIGHLY IMAGINATIVE TELEVISION PROGRAMME 
FOR ME WAS VERY SPECIAL 
FORTY YEARS LATER IT'S STILL AS POPULAR AS IT WAS WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT IT'S AMAZING 
ACTING IS GENERALLY VERY EPHEMERAL 
I WAS IN OLIVIER'S COMPANY AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE PINNACLE 
BUT I GET MUCH MORE FEEDBACK FROM THUNDERBIRDS 
THE BOOKS THAT WE HAD AND THUNDERBIRDS 
IT KIND OF PROMISED IT TO YOU AS A BOY 
THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE GONNA DO WHEN YOU GREW UP 
AND YOU WERE PROBABLY GONNA LOOK AS HANDSOME 
AS ONE OF THOSE PUPPETS AS WELL 
AND ERM 
SO LIFE HAS BEEN A BIT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT SINCE
