NOT DO BUILDING I'M PREPARED TO DO ALL THE DECORATING THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING 
I'D SAY THAT'S ALL THE INFORMATION WE REQUIRE I'M LIMITED IN THAT I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT GARDENS 
I CARE VERY LITTLE FOR GARDENS DOES THAT MAKE YOU NERVOUS 
M. M. M. SLIGHTLY MAKES ME NERVOUS

THE LEAVES GET DUSTY RIGHT YEAH THAT'S REALLY REALLY GIVEN ME AN ENTHUSIASM FOR NATURE AND GARDENS 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT ERIC AND ESTATE AGENTS I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT PLANTS 
NO BECAUSE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WARWICK A MARKET TOWN IN THE HEART OF ENGLAND 
THE MOST IMPRESSIVE ATTRACTION HERE IS THE BEAUTIFUL MEDIEVAL CASTLE DATING BACK ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
THE CASTLE IS ONE OF THE TOP TEN MOST VISITED PLACES IN THE COUNTRY 
DID YOU KNOW THE DISTRICT OF WARWICK HAS A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE 
AND HAS ALMOST EQUAL NUMBERS OF MALE AND FEMALE RESIDENTS 
THE WARWICK ART CENTRE IS THE SECOND LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY BEATEN ONLY BY THE BARBICAN IN LONDON 
ALSO THE UNIVERSITY OF WARWICK STUDENT UNION IS THE LARGEST IN THE U. K. 
WHY KRISTIAN YOU'RE LIKE A MAN POSSESSED 
IT'S ALL ABOUT GETTING YOUR FACTS RIGHT IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED I'LL FIND SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE 
FINE FIRST TAKE A QUICK BREATHER WHILST EVERYONE AT HOME 
GETS A CHANCE TO SEE WHAT TWO TWENTY FIVE K. WOULD GET ELSEWHERE AROUND THE COUNTRY 
GOOD POINT UP IN NORTH SHIELDS THE ANGEL OF THE NORTH IS OFFERING YOU THIS DIVINE PROPERTY 
A TWO BEDROOM MID TERRACE WHICH HAS BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY RENOVATED 
THE HALLWAY IS GRAND AND INVITING THE LOUNGE COSY AND RELAXING 
AND THAT MODERN STYLISH KITCHEN IS PERFECT FOR ENTERTAINING 
IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
IF YOU ARE AFTER A HEAVENLY PROPERTY THIS DUPLEX APARTMENT COULD BE THE ONE 
A MAGNIFICENT CHURCH CONVERSION IN MANCHESTER 
IT STRETCHES OVER TWO FLOORS HAS TWO BEDROOMS NEWLY FITTED KITCHEN AND BATHROOM AND AMPLE PARKING 
IF YOU'RE NOT AS GREEN FINGERED AS SUE 
YOU MUST BE TEMPTED BY THE MAINTENANCE FREE COMMUNAL GARDENS 
SAY YOUR PRAYERS AND MAKE A WISH AS THIS HOME COULD BE YOURS AT TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
AND FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE MODERN HOW ABOUT THIS FOUR BEDROOM DETACHED HOUSE IN NORWICH 
APPEALING SURELY TO THOSE WHO ARE LESS DIY INCLINED 
A NEW BUILD KITTED OUT TO THE BEST POSSIBLE STANDARD 
THERE'S TWO RECEPTION ROOMS AND TWO BATHROOMS ALTHOUGH IF YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR STAMP ON THE PLACE 
THE GARDEN IS LIKE A BLANK CANVAS CRYING OUT TO BE TINKERED WITH 
SNAP IT UP FOR TWO MILLION ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
TO UNDERSTAND THE PROPERTY MARKET I NEED TO UNDERSTAND WARWICK SO I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH 
NOT BORING RESEARCH ON THE CASTLE I'VE FOUND OUT INTERESTING FACTS 
HELLO MY NAME'S ED PLEASED TO MEET YOU HI ED MY NAME'S ANDY 
UM TIMMY MALLET STUDIED HISTORY AT WARWICK UNIVERSITY 
HOW'S THAT FOR A START 
THEY'RE ALMOST FIRST TIME BUYERS THEY'VE BEEN RENTING FOR TWELVE MONTHS RIGHT 
INTERESTING LANDMARKS OF THE AREA OBVIOUSLY WARWICK CASTLE 
WE'VE GOT THE LORD LEICESTER HOSPITAL 
SUE OF ERIC AND SUE IS A NIGHTMARE TO FIND A HOUSE FOR O. K. 
THE CHURCH OF SAINT MARY'S APPARENTLY IT'S GOT A VERY LARGE TOWER BUT I CAN'T QUITE FIND IT 
THEY'VE LOOKED AT ABOUT A HUNDRED HOUSES CRIKEY THAT IS A LOT YES 
DO YOU HEAR THAT BELL QUITE LOUD 
YES BECAUSE I USED TO LIVE VERY CLOSE TO IT THERE YOU GO 
THAT'S A NEW FACT THAT WARWICK BELL IS QUITE LOUD 
SHE'S QUITE PARTICULAR ABOUT THE BACK GARDEN ERIC IS INTO PAINTING 
SHE WATCHES YOU ON THAT HOUSE PROGRAMME I WATCH YOU ALL THE TIME 
WHAT'S WEIRD NOW IS YOU'RE ACTUALLY WATCHING YOURSELF OH NO THAT'S SCARED HER OFF 
THEY NEED THREE BEDROOMS THEY NEED BACK GARDEN GARAGE IF POSSIBLE 
I'M STUCK BEAUCHAMP CHAPEL SAINT MARY'S MOST FAMOUS MONARCHS LYING IN A TOMB THERE 
THEY'VE GOT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND QUID TO SPEND DO YOU THINK IS THAT QUITE LOW I THINK WE HAVE SOMETHING FOR THEM 
GO AND FIND OUT ABOUT THE BEAUCHAMP CHAPEL YOU'RE LIKE AN ENCYCLOPAEDIA 
I'M GOING TO GO NOW O. K. 
TAKE THESE DETAILS AWAY THEN CAN WE CALL BACK AND GET SOME VIEWINGS I'D LOVE TO THERE'S THE HAND 
AND MY FAVOURITE FACT IS THAT WARWICK IS A MOVIE STAR WELL TO BE HONEST MORE OF A T. V. STAR 
THE BUILDINGS IN WARWICK HAVE STARRED IN PRIDE AND PREJUDICE 
MOLL FLANDERS AND IN THE THIRD SERIES EPISODE TWO OF DOCTOR WHO 
AT THIS PASS IN PROCEEDINGS I WOULD LIKE TO IMPART WITH ALL OF YOU THAT I AM ABSOLUTELY SPENT 
MY MOJO IS NO LONGER A MOJO IT'S JUST A MO I'M EXHAUSTED 
IT'S BEEN HARD WHY ARE YOU PUFFED OUT ARE YOU BECAUSE I THINK THIS WAS A TOUGH TOUGH CHALLENGE 
WELL WE DIDN'T FIND IT SO TOUGH 
I THINK SUE AND ERIC HAVE BEEN A BIT LAZY IN THE TWELVE MONTHS THEY'VE BEEN BROWSING 
BECAUSE THE PROPERTY HUNTING SQUAD AND I GOT OUT THERE AND THEY HANDED ME THIS 
THEY SAID THAT'S LOVELY AND I SAID YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS LOVELY 
THEY SHOWED ME THE BACK GARDEN AND I SAID SUE'S GONNA LOVE THAT 
AND THEN THEY SHOWED ME THIS THE LOUNGE ROOM AND I SAID ERIC'S GOING TO LOVE THAT ISN'T HE 
THEN THEY SHOWED ME THIS AND I SAID THEY'RE BOTH GOING TO LOVE IT 
I WENT DOWN THE ROUTE OF FINDING A TOWNHOUSE SO I SAID TO MY PROPERTY HUNTING TEAM 
AND I SAID GO OUT ACROSS THE REALMS OF WARWICK AND THIS IS WHAT WE'VE TURNED UP 
IT IS A MODERN TOWNHOUSE I DO BELIEVE IT'S WHAT THEY'VE SPENT THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS HUNTING FOR 
QUESTION GO ON THE BACK GARDEN ERIC SAID THEY'VE ALWAYS GOT POSTAGE STAMP BACK GARDENS HAS THAT 
UM NO IT'S MUCH LARGER THAN A POSTAGE STAMP 
THE WILD CARD IS THIS 
IT'S LOVELY NOW GO INSIDE THE WILD CARD AND THIS IS WHY WE WENT FOR IT THE BACK GARDEN 
REAR GARDEN PROVIDES A MOST ATTRACTIVE FEATURE TO THE PROPERTY 
IT HAS UM 
SHRUB BORDER BUSHES FRUIT AND SPECIMEN TREES 
AND BAMBOO SO TELL US WE'RE FOOLS FOR PICKING THAT 
YOU CAN'T IT'S IMPOSSIBLE IT'S THE WILD CARD THEY'RE GOING TO LOVE IT 
FIRST LET'S COMMENCE THE VIEWINGS WITH PROPERTY NUMBER ONE HIS ONE 
TOWNHOUSE THREE BEDROOMS LOW MAINTENANCE AND A DECENT GARDEN NEED I SAY MORE YES 
RIGHT IT'S A WELL TURNED OUT PROPERTY LOCATED IN THE MOST RESPECTABLE AREA OF WARWICK 
WHICH I THINK IS ALL RATHER FITTING FOR THIS RATHER RESPECTABLE COUPLE 
O. K. ERIC AND SUE PROPERTY NUMBER ONE IS MY FIND 
YOU SAID YOU WANTED A TOWNHOUSE AND THERE I HAVE FOUND YOU A THREE STOREY TOWNHOUSE 
MODERN BUT IN THE GEORGIAN STYLE UM WHAT CAN I SAY 
AS IT'S MODERN IN TERMS OF INSULATION AND ALL THOSE THINGS IT'S TOP SPEC YEAH 
IT HAS A GARDEN WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK 
IT'S CHARMING ACTUALLY VERY PLEASANT CLEAN AND TIDY 
NICE COURTYARD AT THE FRONT YEAH 
VERY NICE I LIKE THE GEORGIAN DETAIL WHERE WITH THE WINDOW THERE 
BECAUSE IN THE OLD DAYS THE GEORGIANS HAD TO DEFEND THEIR HOUSES WITH BOWS AND ARROWS FROM ASSAILANTS 
AND THEY'VE PLAYED ON THAT AND MIRRORED THAT 
ED IT REALLY IT LIFTS DOESN'T IT IT 
ED ED YOU'RE GETTING YOUR MEDIEVAL HISTORY AND YOUR GEORGIAN ARCHITECTURE SLIGHTLY BLURRED 
I'M RIGHT IN THAT AREN'T I YES YES I THINK SO SO THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO 
I DON'T THINK THERE WERE TOO MANY BOWS AND ARROWS IN GEORGIAN TIMES 
BUT CARRY ON IN THAT VEIN AND YOU MIGHT DISCOVER THAT THEY COME BACK IN FASHION 
NOW THE AREA IS THIS A GOOD AREA THE AREA THE ESTATE AREA LOOKS QUITE PLEASANT 
BUT THIS PARTICULAR AREA I FEEL IS A BIT CLOSED IN A BIT CLAUSTROPHOBIC 
CAN I MAKE A SUGGESTION WHY I THINK IT MIGHT FEEL THAT WAY AT THE MOMENT 
BECAUSE THE SUN IS QUITE LOW IT'S THE SUN'S FAULT HANG ON OH THE SUN HOLD ON 
BECAUSE IT'S CASTING A GREAT BIG SHADOW YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT 
I FEEL LIKE I'M FIGHTING A LOSING BATTLE HERE YES I KNOW BRING BACK THOSE BOWS AND ARROWS 
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE THERE GO IN THERE ENJOY THE HOUSE 
IGNORE YOUR INITIAL THOUGHTS ABOUT IT BEING CLAUSTROPHOBIC AND HEMMED IN BECAUSE IT IS THE SUN'S FAULT 
SEE WHAT YOU THINK O. K. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THE SUN LISTEN LISTEN LISTEN JUST A MINUTE 
WHAT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT CLAUSTROPHOBIC AND HEMMED IN IS O. K. 
THAT IS CLAUSTROPHOBIC AND HEMMED IN YOU'VE KILLED IT YOU'VE KILLED IT THIS IS FINE THIS IS FINE 
IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY LONG DAY ISN'T IT 
RIGHT RUB ME THREE TIMES BECAUSE I AM THE PROPERTY GENIE TO GRANT ALL WISHES 
DOWNSTAIRS TOILET 
THAT'S PLEASANT NICE COLOURS 
A NICE MAUVE PINKY COLOUR 
WHO WOULD WANT THAT WHO WOULD WANT THAT COLOUR OF TOILET SUITE 
MY FAVOURITE COLOURS SUE SEEMS TO LIKE THE PALETTE IN THERE 
INTERESTING THAT SUE HAS GONE FOR THE PALETTE FIRST BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY ERIC IN THE PAINT GAME 
HE WOULD HAVE YOU'D THINK MORE INPUT 
ERIC'S PROBABLY SPENT SIX MONTHS DESIGNING THAT COLOUR M. M. M. 
KITCHEN IT'S COMPACT ISN'T IT IT'S A LITTLE BIT SMALL 
GOOD WORDS COMING OUT OF THEM NOW COMPACT AND SMALL 
THEY'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT RONNIE CORBETT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT HIS HOUSE 
THAT'S QUITE PLEASANT IT'S NICE IT'S NICE AND BRIGHT IT'S JUST IT'S A BIT SMALL 
I'M HEARING THE WORD PLEASANT THE P. WORD I'M QUITE HAPPY WITH 
DID YOU NOT HEAR THE Q. WORD BEFORE THE P. WORD WHAT QUITE YEAH QUITE PLEASANT 
O. K. HERE'S THE LOUNGE GOOD SPACE NICE AND LIGHT ABOUT THE SAME IT'S QUITE PLEASANT 
OH NO OH IT'S THE QP AGAIN A QUITE PLEASANT REMARK 
I LIKE THE FIREPLACE I QUITE LIKE THE FIREPLACE YEAH THAT'S A NICE FEATURE 
WE HAVE TO LOSE THE Q. WORD THE QUITE WORD 
THE FIRE YEAH BUT THE FIRE IS QUITE NICE 
THAT COULD BE AN ISSUE YEAH BECAUSE IT'S QUITE LOW ISN'T IT 
IT MIGHT ACTUALLY FIT ALONG THERE BUT IT WOULD BE OUT TO ABOUT HERE 
THEIR SOFA MIGHT ACTUALLY FIT HERE GOSH BUT IT SEEMED SO SMALL AT THE INITIAL LOOK 
ACTUALLY THE SOFA MIGHT ACTUALLY FIT IN THERE THAT'S GOOD 
IT'S RELATIVELY WELL DECORATED AS WELL M. M. M. 
IT WOULDN'T NEED TOO MUCH WORK ON IT I DON'T THINK 
GIVE ERIC HIS PRAISE HE'S TRYING ISN'T HE 
HE'S TRYING TO ACCOMMODATE YOUR THE THING IS SLIGHTLY EMBARRASSING CHOICE OF HOUSE 
THIS IS A BEDROOM WELL IT COULD BE USED FOR CLARK'S ROOM COULDN'T IT IT'S BIG ENOUGH 
CLARK'S IN THERE CLARK'S BEEN HOUSED THEY'VE IMAGINED CLARK IN THERE 
CHILLING OUT ROOM M. M. M. YEAH TELEVISION 
A CHILLING OUT ROOM THERE YOU GO YEAH CLARK WOULD LIKE THAT 
M. M. M. THIS IS NICE ISN'T IT 
IT'LL KEEP YOU HAPPY ON THE GARDEN SIDE BY THE LOOK OF IT YES 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT MY FAVOURITE SEASON IN THE GARDEN IS 
NO 
THE BATHROOM BATHROOM NICE 
THIS WILL BE INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO BE AN INTERNAL BATHROOM 
AND I DON'T THINK THEY'LL DEAL WITH THIS VERY WELL 
NOT A BAD COLOUR YES JUST A BIT DARK IN THERE WITH NO LIGHT ISN'T IT NO WINDOWS M. M. M. 
THEY HAVEN'T NO THEY HAVEN'T 
AND THE REASON YOU CHOSE AN INTERNAL BATHROOM IS BECAUSE I DIDN'T BUILD IT AND IT CAME WITH THE HOUSE 
YEAH IT'S NOT BAD YEAH IT'S O. K. COSY YEP I WOULD SAY COSY 
I'M SURE YOU'RE PROBABLY POINTING FINGERS AT THE T. V. SCREEN WAGGLING AWAY THERE 
HE'S DONE IT AGAIN HE'S DONE IT AGAIN BIG NOSE HAS DONE IT AGAIN 
THE BOTTOM LINE IS I'VE DELIVERED ON A SILVER PLATTER EXACTLY THE BEST GARDEN IN WARWICK 
THE BEST WILL YOU GIVE ME A CHANCE 
NO GO ON EXACTLY WHAT THEY ASKED FOR IT IS 
SO WE'VE GOT THE SECOND BEDROOM 
ACTUALLY IT LOOKS THE SAME SIZE AS THE ONE WE'VE ALREADY SEEN BUT THIS ALREADY HAS THE FURNITURE IN 
FITTED WARDROBES PLENTY OF SPACE 
IN FACT THINKING ABOUT IT THE WAY IT'S SET UP 
THAT ROOM WE JUST LOOKED AT IN THERE COULD BE USED AS A DINING ROOM 
BRILLIANT IDEA I WOULD I WOULD THAT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA 
I WOULD DISAGREE WITH ERIC ABOUT PUTTING THE DINING ROOM UPSTAIRS 
BY THE TIME YOU'VE TAKEN YOUR DUCK TERRINE UPSTAIRS IT'S GONE HOLD 
I LIKE THE STYLE OF THE WARDROBE 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY CALL THEM SHAKER STYLE OR NEW ENGLAND IT'S LOVELY THE SORT OF THING I LIKE 
I LIKE THIS IT'S LIKE HAVE LAWRENCE LLEWELYN BOWEN ON THE SHOW IN DISGUISE 
SHAKER STYLE 
I FEEL WE'RE GOING TO REACH A CRESCENDO NOW AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE IT'S BUILDING TO SOMETHING 
THIS IS THE MAIN BEDROOM MAIN BEDROOM 
NICE AND BRIGHT NO WARDROBES 
THERE'LL BE ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE WARDROBE WE'VE GOT 
SHE IS PLANNING TO PUT A WARDROBE THERE AND THAT IS AN WASTE OF TIME BECAUSE IN THAT ROOM IS OH YES 
THE GREATEST WALK IN WARDROBE IN THE WORLD 
IT'S A WARDROBE OH THAT'S CLEVER THAT'S NOT SO BAD 
WOULD JUST ABOUT GET YOUR STUFF IN THERE YOU COULD HAVE THE DRAWERS 
THAT HOUSE BROUGHT THEM TO LIFE SHE'S VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT YOU SAID WE'D GET A CRESCENDO 
THAT'S PLEASANT BIG ENOUGH YEAH CLOSE ENOUGH THAT'S NICE 
IT'S A NICE BATHROOM QUITE ROOMY SMASHING AT LEAST YOU CAN MOVE ROUND IN IT 
WELLITY WELLITY WELLITY WELLITY 
THAT WAS A MIXED BAG OF WORDS THAT FORMED SENTENCES THAT WEREN'T NECESSARILY GREAT WERE THEY 
I WOULD SAY IT WAS QUITE PLEASANT 
ERIC I FELT THERE WAS MAYBE SOME SLIGHT RELUCTANCE TOWARDS THE HOUSE YES A LITTLE BIT YES 
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T AWARE 
IT HAS A GARAGE GREAT 
I MEAN KRISTIAN SAID LOOK DO YOU THINK THE PROBLEM IS ERIC DOESN'T KNOW THERE'S A GARAGE HERE 
I SAID I'LL GO OUT AND SHOW HIM THIS IS YOURS 
YOU DO GET PARKING HERE SO YOU'VE GOT THE PROPERTY YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING ON YOUR WISH LIST 
YES I MUST ADMIT WE HAVE GOT EVERYTHING ON THE WISH LIST BUT THERE'S STILL RESERVATIONS 
SOMETHING'S HOLDING YOU BACK MAYBE WHEN YOU FIND OUT THE PRICE THAT'LL MAKE YOU THINK IT'S PERFECT 
SECOND THOUGHTS ALL RIGHT WELL LET'S GO FIND THAT PRICE O. K. 
SUE I WOULD SAY A TEPID RESPONSE ON THE HOUSE MM HMM MM HMM YES THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH TO SAY YES 
WHAT WOULD BE YOUR RESPONSE IF YOU WERE DESCRIBING IT TO ME FOR THE GARDEN GOOD GARDEN 
YEAH A GOOD BLANK CANVAS FOR ME TO DEAL WITH YES 
I'VE STRUGGLED TO FIND SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW YOU COULD FALL IN LOVE WITH RIGHT 
WHAT WOULD YOU DO WELL I'D SPLIT IT UP INTO TWO AREAS 
TO CREATE INTEREST SO THAT'S RIGHT AND THEN YES 
ONE THING I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT YOU'VE GOT A PATIO THERE AND YOU'VE GOT THE PATIO DOWN THERE 
RIGHT THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT SUN IN THE MORNING AND IN THE AFTERNOON 
SO ONE IS FOR MORNING ONE IS FOR AFTERNOON 
TWICE YES SO YOU'VE GOT TO KIND OF PLANT ROUND THAT RIGHT 
BUT YOU COULD DO THAT COURSE I COULD YES
