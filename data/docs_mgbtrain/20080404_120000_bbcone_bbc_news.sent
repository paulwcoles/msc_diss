BEING GIVEN TO THE COURT IN THAT 
TRIAL ON THE B. B. C. NEWS WEBSITE 
ZIMBABWE'S PRESIDENT MUGABE IS 
MEETING THE LEADERSHIP OF HIS ZANU 
P. F. PARTY IN HARARE AS THIS COUNTRY 
CONTINUES ITS WEIGHT TO HEAR THE 
RESULTS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION THE MOVEMENT FOR 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE SAYS THAT ITS 
LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI IS THE 
WINNER AND IT IS GOING TO COURT TO 
GET THAT RESULTS PUBLISHED THE B. B. C. 
IS BANNED FROM ZIMBABWE BUT WE CAN 
GET THE LATEST FROM OUR 
CORRESPONDENT ON THE SOUTH AFRICA 
ZIMBABWE BORDER 
THAT MEETING OF ROBERT MUGABE'S 
INNER CIRCLE IS STILL UNDER WAY 
ZANU P. F. THE RULING PARTY HAS 
CRUCIAL DECISION TO MAKE WHERE 
THERE TO BACK THE PRESIDENT IF IT 
GOES TO A SECOND ROUND OR WHETHER 
TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO STEP ASIDE WE 
HAVE HEARD ABOUT SPLITS IN THE 
PARTY BUT WE HAVE HEARD WORD TO 
DATE FROM HARARE THAT AS HE ARRIVED 
ROBERT MUGABE WAS IN RELAXED MOOD 
SMILING AND MAKING JOKES FOR NOW 
HIS COUNTRY IS NATION IN WAITING 
OUR COLLEAGUES REPORT FROM 
JOHANNESBURG JOHANNESBURG THE MORNING COMMUTE LIFE GOES ON 
BUT ZIMBABWE REMAIN IN LIMBO WHICH 
DIRECTION THE COUNTRY WILL FOLLOW 
IS NOT CLEAR EVERYBODY IS HUNGRY 
FOR NEWS NEARLY ONE WEEK AFTER 
EVERYBODY WENT TO THE POLLS THERE 
IS STILL NO RESULT IN THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS 
I AM NOT 
TOO SURE WHY THEY ARE TAKING SO 
LONG MAYBE THERE WILL BE A RE RUN 
BEHIND THE SCENES THE RULING PARTY 
LOCKED IN CRUCIAL LEADERSHIP TALKS 
TO THRASH OUT ITS BATTLE PLAN 
INSIDERS SUGGEST THERE IS DIVISION 
IN THE RANKS WITH GROWING 
EXPECTATION THAT IT COULD RUN TO A 
SECOND ROUND MEETING AFRICAN UNION 
OBSERVERS ROBERT MUGABE SEEMED 
RELAXED HE CERTAINLY DID NOT LOOK 
LIKE A MAN WHOSE FATE HANGS IN THE 
BALANCE CONFIDENT HE REVEALED WHAT 
HE FELT ABOUT THE RESULT AN 
AFRICAN LEADER WITH TWENTY EIGHT YEARS IN THE 
TOP JOB BUT HIS RIVALS CLAIMED HIS 
PARTY IS LYING TO HIM 
I SEE THEM 
MAKING FALSE BRAVADO AND FALSE 
ADVICE TO MUGABE WHICH THEY HAVE 
GIVEN OVER THE YEARS ONE OF THE 
REASONS WE ARE IN THIS CRITICAL 
SITUATION IS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN 
TELLING ROBERT MUGABE LIES AND HE 
HAS BEEN BELIEVING THEM NOW NOW GROWING SECURITY CONCERNS TWO MEN 
ACCUSED OF BEING FOREIGN 
JOURNALISTS ARRESTED BY POLICE AND 
OPPOSITION CLAIMS OF A HOTEL RAID 
THE QUESTION ON EVERYBODY'S LIPS 
WHAT LENGTHS WILL ROBERT MUGABE GO 
TO HAVE TO CLING ON TO POWER THE 
ANSWER IS THAT NOBODY REALLY KNOWS 
THIS IS NOW BASICS AFTER ZIMBABWE'S 
CRUCIAL VOTE AND THE COUNTRY IS 
STILL WAITING FOR RESULTS DAY 
SIX HAVING TRIED THINGS OUT THIS 
FAR IT SEEMS THAT ROBERT MUGABE IS 
DETERMINED TO FIGHT TO THE FINISH 
IN THE WORDS OF ONE LONG TERM 
OBSERVER THAT IS THE NATURE OF THE 
BEAST THE COUNTRY IS STILL WAITING 
FOR RESULTS FROM THE ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION OF THE COUNTRY BY LAW 
THEY SHOULD DECLARE BY MIDNIGHT 
TONIGHT THAT IS A DEADLINE LOCAL 
TIME THERE IS STILL NO SIGN OF 
THAT BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THE 
MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IS 
IN COURT MAKING AN APPLICATION FOR 
THE RESULTS TO BE RELEASED IN FULL

WHAT ARE WE GOING TO LEARN IN THE 
NEXT FEW HOURS 
WHAT WE WILL GET 
HIS DETAILS OF THE EXPENSES OF SEVENTEEN 
M. P.'S THESE WILL INCLUDE CATEGORIES

HOMES ALL M. P.'S THAT DO NOT HAVE AN 
INNER LONDON CONSTITUENCY HAVE AN 
ALLOWANCE FOR THEIR SECOND HOME'S 
UPKEEP WE SHOULD GET DETAILS OF 
MORTGAGE INTEREST PAYMENTS AND

AUTHORITIES HAVE SPENT THREE YEARS 
FIGHTING THESE DETAILS IT TRIED TO 
PREVENT THEM FROM COMING OUT THEY 
HAVE BOWED TO THAT PRESSURE TODAY 
BUT WHAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET IS 
A RECEIPT BY RECEIPT TYPE OF 
INFANTRY IT WILL BE QUITE GENERAL 
UNDER CATEGORIES INVENTORY WHY WHY DO THEY NOT WANT THIS INFORMATION 
TO COME OUT 
THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT 
SECURITY IN IMPLICATIONS IT 
COULD PUT M. P.'S IN JEOPARDY THERE IS 
ALSO A WORRY THAT IF YOU PICK OUT A 
HANDFUL OF M. P.'S SEVENTEEN TODAY THEY WILL 
HAVE THEIR EXPENSES PICKED OVER AND 
TOOK OVER AND THEY WILL BE MADE 
SCAPEGOATS IN SOME SORT OF WAY 
TOOK OVER THERE IS NO SUGGESTION 
THAT THE RULES HAVE BEEN BROKEN 
BUT THERE IS A SUGGESTION THAT THE 
RULES ARE QUITE LAX AND NOT A 
SUFFICIENTLY STRINGENT AND THAT IS 
WHY THIS IS OF INTEREST 
DOZENS OF DEAD AND DYING ANIMALS 
HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED DURING A RAID 
ON A FARM IN COUNTY DOWN OFFICIALS 
FROM THE ANIMAL WELFARE CHARITY THE 
USPCA SAYS THAT CONDITIONS IN WHICH 
THE PIGS AND CATTLE WERE BEING KEPT

THIS REPORT CONTAINS PICTURES WHICH 
YOU MAY FIND DISTRESSING 
EVEN THE ANIMALS LEFT ALIVE WERE 
BEING KEPT IN CONDITIONS THAT CAN 
ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS SQUALID 
PACKED TOGETHER EMERGENCY FOOD AND 
WATER HAD TO BE BROUGHT IN SOME OF 
THE CATTLE AND PIGS WERE HEALTHY 
BUT OTHERS HAD TO BE PUT DOWN BY 
THE ULSTER SOCIETY FOR THE 
PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS 
MANY OF THE DEAD PIGS FORTY COPSES IN 
ALL WERE FOUND DUMPED IN PILE OF WASTE 
AN APPALLING SCENE OF ANIMAL WASTE CRUELTY THERE ARE NO SANITATION 
EFFORT AT ALL BEHIND ME THEY ARE 
STARTING TO EXCAVATE A MASS ANIMAL 
GRAVE OF ANIMALS THAT WE BELIEVE 
DIED THROUGH NEGLECT THEY HAVE 
BEEN HERE FOR WEEKS IF NOT MONTHS 
HOW ON EARTH COULD THIS NUMBER OF 
ANIMALS BE PRESENT ON A FARM FOOD 
BOUGHT FOR THEM TRACTORS ARRIVING 
AND NOBODY REALISED THAT ANIMALS 
WERE BEING KEPT HERE 
EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO HELP 
ANIMALS MOST BADLY TREATED

REVOLUTION WHO CHANGED AMERICA 
FOREVER FOREVER WE ARE GOING TO WALK NON VIOLENTLY 
AND PEACEFULLY TO LEAD THE NATION 
AND THE WORLD NO WE ARE TIRED NOW 
WE HAVE LIVED WITH SLAVERY AND 
SEGREGATION AND THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE YEARS WE HAVE 
WAITED A LONG TIME FOR FREEDOM AND AND IT WAS FREEDOM HE HELPED TO DELIVER 
FREEDOM FROM THE RACIST LAWS THAT 
EXISTED IN AMERICA LESS THAN FIFTY 
YEARS AGO MARTIN LUTHER KING 
HELPED TO INSPIRE A VAST CIVIL 
RIGHTS MOVEMENT THAT WOULD CHANGE 
IT MACK IN APRIL NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT HE CHECKED 
INTO THE LORRAINE MOTEL IN MEMPHIS 
THERE HAD BEEN MANY THREATS AGAINST 
HIM AND THAT NIGHT HE GAVE A SPEECH 
IN WHICH HE SPOKE OF THEM AT WHEN WHEN I WALKED THROUGH THE NIGHT WE AS

A SHOT WAS FIRED HE WAS HIT IN THE 
NECK AND DIED SHORTLY AFTERWARDS 
WITH HIM WAS THE REVEREND JESSE 
JACKSON WHO STILL COMPLIANT WHO 
STILL CAMPAIGNS FULL CIVIL RIGHTS 
IT HURTS SO MATCH SO MUCH THIRTY NINE 
YEARS OLD LOOK AT WHAT AMERICA 
LOST BECAUSE OF THE TOXICITY OF 
RACISM 
SO THERE IS STILL PAIN BUT RACISM ALSO A HUGE LEGACY EVEN THE MAN 
WHO HAD A DREAM MAY NOT HAVE 
IMAGINED THIS THE POSSIBILITY THAT 
A BLACK MAN IT MIGHT BECOME THE 
NEXT U. S. PRESIDENT 
HE WOULD BE LIKE 
HE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO SEE WHAT 
BARACK OBAMA IS DOING MANY MANY AGREE THERE IS UNFINISHED BUSINESS 
THE POVERTY HE DETESTED THE RACISM 
HE SUFFERED ANOTHER UNPOPULAR 
MACK BUT TODAY MANY WELL ON THAT A 
MAN WHO FOUGHT FOR HIS BELIEFS AND 
A ONE ANOTHER UNPOPULAR WAR 
PAEDOPHILES COULD BE BANNED FROM 
SOCIAL NETWORKING WEBSITES SUCH AS 
MYSPACE UNDER MEASURES ANNOUNCED BY 
THE HOME OFFICE CONVICTED SEX 
OFFENDERS WILL BE FORCED TO 
DISCLOSE THEIR E. MAIL ADDRESSES TO 
POLICE WHO WILL PASS THEM ON TO 
THE WEBSITES 
JUST TWO CHILDREN ARE COMMUNICATING 
WITH ONLINE IS OF GROWING CONCERN 
TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO BE 
TARGETED BY PAEDOPHILES OFFENDERS 
MAY HAVE TO REGISTER THEIR E. MAIL 
ADDRESSES WITH THE POLICE SO THEY 
CAN BE MONITORED OR BLOCKED WITH 
SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES LIKE THE IS 
BASED ABROAD AND NEW E. MAIL 
ADDRESS IS SO EASY TO ACQUIRE SOME 
ARE QUESTIONING IF THE NEW RULES 
WILL WORK 
IT IS EASY TO SET UP 
FAKE E. MAIL ADDRESSES FROM ANYWHERE 
YOU CAN PUT IN ANY INFORMATION 
MAKE UP AND INANE PUT IN A FALSE 
ADDRESS AND THE E. MAIL SERVICE WILL 
ADD WILL ACCEPT YOU AND YOU CAN 
LOG ON TO A SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE 
SOME SITES ALLOWED CHILDREN TO PLAY 
GAMES WITH EACH OTHER ACROSS THE 
WORLD AND WITH STRANGERS THAT DO 
NOT REQUIRE AN E. MAIL ADDRESS TO 
REGISTER 
THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS REGISTER THOSE TRYING TO GET AROUND THE 
RULES WILL BE PENALISED WITH UP TO 
FIVE YEARS IN PRISON FOR NOT 
REGISTERING AT A CORRECT E. MAIL 
ADDRESS 
THE FACT IT CANNOT BE BOTH ADDRESS CAN BE FULL PROOF DOES NOT MEAN 
WE SHOULD NOT TRY TO WORK WITH 
SERVICE PROVIDERS 
DOUBT HAVE BEEN 
RAISED QUESTIONING HOW SUCH A 
SERVICE COULD OPERATE 
THE INTERNET IS SO OPEN AND YOU CAN 
DO SO MANY THINGS SO POLITICIANS 
WILL WANT TO CONTROL THINGS AND SAY 
TO US IT YOU HAVE TO HELP US 
CONTROL LET BUT YOU CAN OPEN AN 
ACCOUNT IN SECONDS 
WITH SURVEYS 
SUGGESTING NEARLY HALF OF CHILDREN 
AGED AL THAT EIGHT NOW USE SOCIAL 
NETWORKING SITES THERE IS GROWING 
PRESSURE TO FIND EFFECTIVE WAYS TO 
POLICE THE INTERNET
