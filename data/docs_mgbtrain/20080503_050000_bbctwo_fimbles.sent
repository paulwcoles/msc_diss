RIGHT O. THEN BACK IN A ROLY MO 
WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK INSIDE A BOOK WHO KNOWS WHAT YOU WILL SEE 
WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK INSIDE A BOOK IT'S FUN AS FUN CAN BE 
WITH CATS AND DOGS AND BIRDS AND FROGS 
A MONKEY WHO SAYS 
WONDERFUL THINGS GIANTS AND KINGS 
AND MAYBE A FIMBLE OR TWO 
WHAT HAVE WE HERE 
WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK INSIDE A BOOK WHO KNOWS WHAT YOU MIGHT SEE 
A STORY OR RHYME JUST TAKE THE TIME 
TO READ ALONG WITH ME 
NOW ARE YOU SITTING COMFORTABLY YES 
GOOD THEN I'LL BEGIN 
THIS STORY IS CALLED CROW'S NEW FEATHERS 
CROW WAS TIRED OF BEING JUST ONE COLOUR 
SHE WOULD LOOK AT ALL THE OTHER BIRDS IN THE GARDEN 
WITH THEIR DIFFERENT COLOURED FEATHERS AND SIGH OH 
THEN ONE DAY SHE HAD AN IDEA 
CROW SAW ROBIN WITH HIS RED BREAST 
ROBIN MAY I HAVE ONE OF YOUR RED FEATHERS 
NO SAID ROBIN I NEED ALL MY FEATHERS TO KEEP ME WARM 
CROW SAW YELLOWHAMMER WITH HER YELLOW FEATHERS 
YELLOWHAMMER MAY I HAVE ONE OF YOUR YELLOW FEATHERS 
NO SAID YELLOWHAMMER I NEED ALL MY FEATHERS TO HELP ME FLY 
CROW SAW MAGPIE 
MAGPIE WAS BUSY COLLECTING SHINY BITS AND PIECES TO TAKE TO HER NEST 
MAGPIE MAY I HAVE ONE OF YOUR WHITE FEATHERS 
BUT MAGPIE SAID DON'T BOTHER ME NOW CROW I'M BUSY 
JUST THEN A SINGLE WHITE FEATHER FLOATED DOWN IN FRONT OF CROW 
THEN ANOTHER WHITE FEATHER AND ANOTHER 
CROW LOOKED UP 
SOMEONE WAS SPRING CLEANING SHAKING PILLOWS OUT OF THE WINDOWS 
AND ALL THE LOOSE FEATHERS WERE FLOATING 
CROW COLLECTED THE FLUFFY WHITE FEATHERS 
AND TUCKED THEM UNDER HER WINGS 
YOU LOOK SMART CROW SAID THE OTHER BIRDS 
CROW WANTED TO SEE HOW SHE LOOKED 
WHAT I NEED SHE THOUGHT IS SOMETHING SHINY 
SOON THE FAMILY STARTED TO EAT LUNCH IN THE GARDEN 
CROW SPOTTED A SHINY TEASPOON AND SHE FLEW DOWN AND PICKED IT UP 
CROW LOOKED AT HER REFLECTION IN THE SHINY TEASPOON AND WAS VERY PLEASED 
REMEMBER IF A BLACK AND WHITE BIRD EVER TAKES SOMETHING SHINY FROM YOU 
IT MIGHT JUST BE CROW WANTING TO SEE HER NEW REFLECTION 
HO HO WHAT A LOT OF FEATHERS JUST LIKE THE FEATHER YOU FOUND
