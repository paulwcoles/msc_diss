HE IS STILL THERE BUT FOR HOW MUCH 
LONGER CAN ROBERT MUGABE CLING ON 
TO POWER 
TONIGHT HIGH DRAMA IN ZIMBABWE AS 
FIRST MUGABE IS SAID TO BE ON HIS 
WAY OUT AND THEN STAYS PUT WE 
REPORT FROM INSIDE THE COUNTRY AND 
WE HEAR ARCHBISHOP DESMOND TUTU'S 
FERVENT PLEA THAT MUGABE MUST NOW 
GO GO IT LOOKS UNSTOPPABLE BUT IS THE 
CHINESE ECONOMIC JUGGERNAUT 
BEGINNING TO RUN OUT OF ROAD I I WILL BE IN CHINA TO COUNT THE 
SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL COST OF 
THE MODERN GREAT LEAP FORWARD 
WE WILL ALSO HEAR WHAT THE LAST 
GOVERNOR OF HONG KONG THINKS ABOUT 
IT IT AND HE IS IN CHARGE OF REVIEWING 
M. P. S. EXPENSES BUT NOW THE 
PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONER ON 
STANDARDS IS INVESTIGATING HIM 
GOOD EVENING ONE MINUTE TONIGHT 
ROBERT MUGABE WAS ABOUT TO QUIT THE 
STAGE THE NEXT HE WAS FIGHTING ON 
IN ANOTHER ROUND OF ELECTIONS 
RELIABLE SOURCES SAID THAT THERE 
WERE NEGOTIATIONS TAKING PLACE 
RELIABLE SOURCES SAID THERE WERE 
NOT IT LOOKS AS IF AFTER TWENTY EIGHT YEARS 
OF AUTOCRACY AND THREE DAYS OF 
SUPPOSED VOTE COUNTING HE HAD RUN 
OUT OF RECORD RUN BUT AS OF RIGHT 
NOW HE IS STILL PRESIDENT OF 
ZIMBABWE RUN OUT OF WRIGGLE ROOM 
IN ZIMBABWE IT WAS YET ANOTHER DAY 
OF WAITING FOR ELECTION RESULTS 
FOLLOWED BY A SUDDEN FLURRY OF 
DRAMATIC IF CONTRADICTORY CLAIMS 
ON MUGABE'S FUTURE 
SOME BREAKING 
NEWS FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT IN 
ZIMBABWE 
A B. B. C. REPORTER INSIDE ZIMBABWE THE COUNTRY WAS TOLD THAT 
NEGOTIATIONS WERE TAKING PLACE 
BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND 
OPPOSITION UNDER THE AUSPICES OF 
SOUTH AFRICA AND THE DEAL HAD 
ALMOST BEEN REACHED UNDER WHICH 
MUGABE WOULD STAND DOWN HALF AN 
HOUR LATER THE GOVERNMENT REACTED 
DENYING THE REPORT 
IT IS NOT TRUE 
THERE IS NO NEED FOR THE DEAL 
PRESIDENT MUGABE IS STILL IN THE 
COUNTRY HE IS NOT GOING OUT THERE 
HAVE BEEN NO TALKS BETWEEN 
PRESIDENT MUGABE AND ANOTHER LEADER 
OF SOUTH AFRICA 
AT SIX FORTY FIVE P. M. A 
SENIOR SOURCE IN MUGABE'S PARTY WAS 
QUOTED AS SEEING SAYING THE 
PRESIDENT WAS READY TO STAND DOWN 
THERE ARE SIGNS OF DRAMATIC CHANGE 
IN ZIMBABWE 
FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER 
THE U. S. EMBASSY IN HARARE SAID 
MUGABE WAS EXPECTED TO ADDRESS THE 
NATION ON TELEVISION ALMOST 
IMMEDIATELY FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER THE 
GOVERNMENT AGAIN DENIED THERE HAD 
BEEN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE 
OPPOSITION THERE WAS NO T. V. ADDRESS 
BY EIGHT P. M. M. D. C. LEADER MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI JOINED IN SAYING HE 
JUST WANTED THE ELECTION RESULTS 
ANNOUNCED 
THERE IS NO WAY THE M. P. C. ANNOUNCED WILL ENTER INTO ANY DEAL BEFORE THE 
RESULTS ARE ANNOUNCED M. D. C. THAT 
IS THE LEGAL POSITION WE WANT TO 
KNOW WHO HAS WON WHAT BEFORE WE 
CLAIM ANYTHING WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO 
CLAIM ANYTHING UNTIL THAT IS 
CONFIRMED WE KNOW WHAT WE HAVE ONE 
IN TERMS OF PARLIAMENTARY SEATS IN 
TERMS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE BUT 
IT IS NOT CONFIRMED BY THE JUDICIAL 
BOARD 
SO WHAT 
IS GOING ON MUGABE BOARD IS A WILY POLITICIAN NOT THE SORT 
OF MAN TO ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE 
BOUNCED OUT OF POWER AFTER TWENTY EIGHT YEARS 
BUT TALKING TO THE OPPOSITION 
TONIGHT IT DOES SEEM THEY HAVE 
BEEN TALKS BETWEEN THE TWO SIDE 
PERHAPS TO DISCUSS MUGABE'S EXIT 
STRATEGY 
I HAVEN'T HEARD OF ANY STRATEGY TALKS BETWEEN THE OPPOSITION AND 
ROBERT MUGABE BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT 
TALKS ARE TAKING PLACE AT A LOWER 
LEVEL POSSIBLY INCLUDING THE 
MILITARY AND POLICE L. L. THINK WE CAN 
REASONABLY ASSUME THAT ZANU P. F. IS 
SPEAKING TO NEGOTIATORS I'M SURE 
THEY WILL WANT ASSURANCES THAT 
ROBERT MUGABE WILL NOT BE INDICTED 
IN THE HAGUE THEY WILL WANT 
ASSURANCES THAT SENIOR MILITARY 
COMMANDERS WILL NOT BE PROSECUTED 
BUT ROBERT MUGABE KNOWS THAT HE CAN 
QUITE POSSIBLY SPIN THE ELECTION 
PROCESS ALT LONGER NO RESULTS HAVE 
YET BEEN ANNOUNCED AND FROM THE 
PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST FROM WHICH THE 
NEW PRESIDENT HAS TO SECURE A FIFTY PER CENT 
OF THE VOTE THE M. D. C. HAVE CLAIMED 
THEIR LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
WILL GET SIXTY PER CENT MUGABE WILL GET PER CENT 
AND THE THIRD CANDIDATE ONE TIME 
FINANCE MINISTER SIMBA MAKONI WILL 
GET TEN PER CENT ACCORDING TO ONE ELECTION 
OBSERVER TSVANGIRAI IS AHEAD OF 
MUGABE BUT COULD STILL FALL BELOW 
THE FIFTY PER CENT MARK MEANING THERE WOULD 
HAVE TO BE A SECOND ROUND OF THE 
PRESIDENTIAL VOTE 
AT THE MOMENT 
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE NOT AT THE 
LEVEL BECAUSE MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
ALTHOUGH HE IS AHEAD HAS ONLY 
ABOUT FORTY EIGHT PER CENT AND HE NEEDS TO HAVE FIFTY 
PER CENT PLUS ONE BALLOT IN ORDER TO BE 
DECLARED A LEADER IN ORDER TO 
AVOID A RUN OFF ROBERT MUGABE 
HIMSELF IS AT AROUND FORTY TWO PER CENT 
IF HE IS 
BEING TOLD THAT IT LOOKS LIKE HE 
HAS NOT WON THE FIRST ROUND WHAT I 
THINK THE TACTICS WOULD BE WOULD BE 
TO MAKE SURE HE GETS FORTY THREE PER CENT 
TSVANGIRAI GET FORTY EIGHT PER CENT AND THEY HAVE 
TO GO TO THE SECOND ROUND IN THREE 
WEEKS THAT GIVES HIM THREE WEEKS 
TO FIGHT BACK TO TURN THESE 
MILITIAS ON THE OPPOSITION TO TRY 
TO FIX THE BALLOT AND TO PLAY A 
WHOLE LOT OF CLICKS HE HAS USED 
BEFORE IN ORDER TO STAY ON THAT I 
THINK IS HIS NUMBER ONE OPTION 
A WHOLE LOT OF TRICKS THE IDEA 
THAT ROBERT MUGABE WILL SAY OH IT 
WAS A FAIR FIGHT AND THE FREE AND 
FAIR ELECTION AND I LOST 
CONGRATULATIONS TO TSVANGIRAI I 
THINK IS JUST NOT POSSIBLE WHAT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN ZIMBABWE DEPENDS ON 
ROBERT MUGABE AND OF COURSE ON 
THOSE OFFICIAL RESULTS WHICH 
SURELY CAN'T BE HELD BACK FOR MUCH 
LONGER LONGER JOINING ME NOW FROM ZIMBABWE IT IS 
B. B. C. WORLD AFFAIRS EDITOR JOHN 
SIMPSON HOW DOES IT FEEL THERE 
WELL IT FEELS REALLY SORT OF EDGY 
JEREMY THERE IS SENSE IN WHICH 
I THINK REALLY THAT IS ONE OF THE 
REASONS WHY WE HAD ALL THESE CRAZY 
RUMOURS TODAY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE 
SO ON EDGE THEY ARE SO TENSE THEY 
ARE SO DESPERATE FOR SOME KIND OF 
FEELING THAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING 
AND THAT CHANGE IS HAPPENING AND 
THAT IS NOT JUST THE M. D. C. SUPPORTERS 
EITHER I THINK IT IS THE GENERAL 
FEELING OF NERVOUSNESS TENSION AND 
EXCITEMENT PEOPLE NORMALLY 
RATIONAL PERFECTLY SENSIBLE PEOPLE 
ARE PREPARED TO FOR INSTANCE BY 
THE NOTION THAT ROBERT MUGABE WHO 
CLEARLY HAS ABSOLUTELY ZERO 
INTENTION OF STEPPING DOWN AND 
BEING PUT ASIDE HAVING TO LEAVE 
THE COUNTRY AND GOING INTO 
RESIDENTS SOMEWHERE ELSE PERHAPS 
EVEN FACING TRIAL AT THE HAGUE 
THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO INTENTION 
OF THIS THEY MANAGED TO CONVINCE 
THEMSELVES FOR ABOUT AN HOUR THAT 
HE WAS GOING ON TELEVISION TO TELL 
HIS PEOPLE THAT HE WAS JUST GOING 
TO STEP DOWN AND DO PRECISELY THAT 
IT WAS CRAZY BUT THAT IS WHAT THE 
FEELING IS AT THE MOMENT 
INTERESTING WHERE THESE STORIES 
ARE COMING FROM ONE STORY THE ONE 
ABOUT HIM GOING ON T. V. CAME FROM 
THE UP AMERICAN EMBASSY WE ARE 
TOLD ARE THEY TRYING TO BOUNCE 
MUGABE INTO GOING OR WHAT 
NO WELL 
MAYBE THEY ARE I'M SURE THEY WOULD 
LOVE TO DO THAT L. DON'T THINK SO 
WE ALL GET OURSELVES I THINK INTO 
THE KIND OF MOOD WHERE WE A FIRST 
OF ALL EXPECT SOMETHING IS VERY TO 
HAPPEN AND THEN EVERY LITTLE SIGN 
EVERY INDICATION SEEMS TO BACK THAT 
UP I DON'T THINK IT IS THE 
AMERICANS TRYING TO FORCE IT WHAT 
I DO THINK THOUGH IS THAT THE M. D. C. 
IS VERY GOOD AT PERSUADING PEOPLE 
TO THINK THINGS IT IS VERY VERY 
CLEVERLY MANAGED TO LODGE ALL SORTS 
OF THINGS IN PEOPLE'S MINDS TO BE 
HONEST I DON'T THINK ANY RATIONAL 
PERSON THINKS THAT MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI HAS GOT SIXTY PER CENT OF THE 
PRESIDENTIAL VOTE L. L. DON'T THINK 
THAT IS A SHOT ON THE BOARD AND 
YET THAT IS THE FIGURE YOU OFTEN 
HEAR BANDIED AROUND PUT AROUND BY 
THE M. D. C. THE SECOND ASPECT IS THAT 
A LOT OF THE JOURNALIST FOR 
INSTANCE AS WELL AS EMBASSIES LIKE 
THE AMERICAN AND OTHER EMBASSIES 
HERE ARE VERY ANXIOUS FOR THE M. D. C. 
TO WIN AND SO THEY AT THEIR LITTLE 
BIT OF SPIN AND SUPPORT TO IT 
THEY ADD IT ALL ENDS UP AS A 
MASSIVE POINT OF APPARENT MOVEMENT 
IN ONE DIRECTION WHEREAS IN FACT 
IT IS ALL JUST RUMOURS AND WHISPERS 
I WILL NOT HOLD YOU TO IT OF 
COURSE BUT WHAT IS YOUR HUNCH HIS 
MUGABE GOING TO GO 
IS MUGABE 
THINK HE IS L. DON'T THINK HE IS 
COMING TO GO WILLINGLY L. THINK 
THERE WILL HAVE TO BE SOME KIND OF 
A DEAL WHICH WILL PROTECT HIM FROM 
BEING HAULED OFF TO THE HAGUE FOR 
INSTANCE I THINK SOME DEAL WHICH 
HAS HIS AGREEMENT IS GOING TO HAVE 
TO BE WORKED OUT L. DON'T THINK 
THERE IS ANY OTHER WAY THAT IS THE 
KIND OF POSITIVE SIDE OF ME L. 
DON'T LIKE TO SEE A LOVELY COUNTRY 
LIKE THIS GOING DOWN THE TUBE SO 
FAST THE MORE DEPRESSING SIGHT OF 
ME SAYS WELL PEOPLE WILL ONCE 
AGAIN SAY TO THEMSELVES HE IS AN 
OLD MAN HE IS EIGHTY FOUR HE SURELY CAN'T 
LAST TOO MUCH LONGER WE WILL PUT 
UP WITH ANOTHER FEW YEARS OF HIM 
AND THEN HOPE YOU WILL GO AWAY AND 
LEAVE US ALONE I'M AFRAID THAT 
THAT MAY BE THE MORE LIKELY OUTCOME 
A LITTLE EARLIER I SPOKE TO 
ARCHBISHOP DESMOND TUTU IN SOUTH 
AFRICA I KICKED OFF BY ASKING HIM 
WHAT HE MADE OF REPORTS THAT SOME 
SORT OF DEAL MIGHT BE IMMINENT 
ANYTHING THAT WOULD SAVE THE 
POSSIBILITIES OF BLOODSHED OF 
CONFLICT I AM QUITE WILLING TO 
SUPPORT A ANYTHING THAT SAYS THEY 
ARE ARRANGING FOR A RELATIVELY 
SMOOTH HANDOVER FROM ONE 
ADMINISTRATION TO ANOTHER THAT 
WOULD BE WELCOMED BY MOST OF US 
THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE HAVE 
SUFFERED ENOUGH AND FOR GOODNESS 
SAKE WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE 
POSSIBILITIES OF BLOODSHED 
IT DOES 
SEEM AS IF PEOPLE THINGS ARE 
COMING TO SOME SORT OF PREMONT IN 
HARARE DOESN'T IT 
IT DOES FEEL AS 
THOUGH THINGS ARE COMING TO A HEAD 
SOME SORT OF DUMONT ALMOST 
EVERYBODY WOULD SAY THAT THE 
RESULTS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HELD 
BACK AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT POSTPONED 
HAD IT NOT BEEN THE FACT THAT MR. 
MUGABE HAS NOT WON THE ELECTION L. 
THINK THAT HAD ZANU P. F. WON THESE 
ELECTIONS WE WOULD HAVE HAD THEM 
CROWING A LONG TIME AGO AND IT 
APPEARS TO ME THAT THE EVIDENCE 
SUPPORTS THE CLAIMS OF THE M. D. C. TO 
HAVE ONE 
IF THE ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION CALLS FOR A RUN OFF 
BETWEEN ROBERT MUGABE AND THE 
OPPOSITION WHAT DO YOU THINK 
SHOULD HAPPEN 
I AM A MUD THOSE WHO 
SAY THAT ANY KIND OF COMPROMISE 
THAT WILL ULTIMATELY ENSURE THAT 
THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS ACCEPTED 
WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD 
WANT TO SUPPORT 
MOST PEOPLE WILL HAVE TENDED TO BE 
PURISTS AND WANT A VERY CLEAR CUT 
SITUATION BUT IN A FRAUGHT 
SITUATION SUCH AS WE HAVE HAD BEEN 
ZIMBABWE ANYTHING THAT IS HELPING 
TOWARDS A MOVE THE TRANSITION FROM 
THE REPRESSION TO THE POSSIBILITIES 
OF DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM FOR 
GOODNESS SAKE PLEASE LET US A SET 
ACCEPT THAT AND NOT BE BRAVE 
SEVERAL MILES AWAY FROM THE 
EPICENTRE OF PROBLEMS 
WHAT IS YOUR 
HOPE FOR THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE I I HOPE VERY MUCH THAT ONE THEY WILL 
HAVE PEACE AND STABILITY TWO THAT 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL 
BUTTRESS SUPPORT AND INVEST AS 
MUCH AS THEY CAN IN THE WHOLE 
PROCESS OF RECONSTRUCTION ZIMBABWE 
WAS AS I SAY A SHOWPIECE A 
COUNTRY THAT PRODUCED ENOUGH TO 
FEED ITS OWN PEOPLE AND EXPORT FOOD 
IT WAS A COUNTRY THAT WE BOASTED 
ABOUT IT HAD AN ECONOMY THAT WAS 
BUSTLING AND WE HOPE THAT ALL OF 
US IN THE WORLD WILL KNOW THAT WE 
HAVE HELPED ZIMBABWE RECOVER THANK THANK YOU 
GOD BLESS YOU 
MORE FROM YOU ZIMBABWE ON TOMORROW'S PROBLEM 
COMING UP ARE CRACKS APPEARING IN 
CHINA'S ECONOMY WE HAVE AN IN 
DEPTH REPORT 
BEFORE THAT A ROUND UP OF TODAY'S 
NEWS THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT HAS 
DENIED A NUMBER OF REPORTS THAT 
ROBERT MUGABE IS READY TO 
ACKNOWLEDGE ELECTORAL DEFEAT AND 
STAND ASIDE FIGURES FROM THE 
OPPOSITION AND SENIOR SOURCE FROM 
WITHIN MUGABE'S OWN PARTY HAD 
SIGNALLED THAT THE EIGHTY FOUR YEAR OLD HAD 
IN PRINCIPLE AGREED TO STAND DOWN 
MICHAEL MARTIN IS TO BE 
INVESTIGATED OVER HIS EXPENSES 
PARLIAMENTARY STANDARDS 
COMMISSIONER JOHN LYON IS TO LOOK 
INTO COMPLAINTS THAT HIS WIFE SPENT 
FOUR THOUSAND OF PUBLIC MONEY ON TAXIS FOR 
SHOPPING TRIPS I'M JOINED BY OUR 
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT HOW DID 
THIS COMPLAINT COME ABOUT LAST LAST YEAR IT WAS DISCLOSED THAT THE 
SPEAKER'S WIFE HAD SPENT FOUR THOUSAND ON 
TAXES WE WERE TOLD THAT THE 
SPEAKER'S SPOKESMAN AT THE TIME LET 
IT BE KNOWN THAT THIS WAS IN 
CONNECTION WITH BUYING ITEMS FOR 
OFFICIAL FUNCTIONS AND THAT SHE WAS 
AT ALL TIMES A CAMPAIGN BY AN 
OFFICIAL OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
YOU WILL NOTICE THE WOULD USE OF 
THE WORD OFFICIAL TWICE HOWEVER 
LAST MONTH IT BECAME CLEAR THAT 
THAT WAS NOT THE CASE MIKE GRANATT 
RESIGNED SAYING HE HAD BEEN MISLED 
BY PEOPLE AROUND THE SPEAKER THAT 
THESE WERE UNOFFICIAL INFORMAL 
OCCASIONS AND THE OFFICIAL WAS NOT 
OFFICIAL AT ALL IT WAS IN FACT 
MARY MARTIN'S FRIEND AND CLEANER 
WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED HER AT THE 
TIME THE TAXPAYERS' ALLIANCE 
COMPLAINED TO PARLIAMENTARY MY 
STANDARDS TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE 
MISUSE OF PUBLIC MONEY SOMEONE 
WROTE BACK TO SAY I AM SATISFIED 
THAT IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IN CO 
ORDINATION WITH THE CODE OF CONDUCT 
OF PARLIAMENT THE TAXPAYERS' 
ALLIANCE SAY THEY ARE DELIGHTED 
WITH THAT RESULT 
THERE ARE 
SUGGESTIONS THAT MR. MARTIN MAY NOT 
HAVE BEEN USING HIS EXPENSES 
PROPERTY THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE 
ASKED TO INVESTIGATE AND IT IS 
SOMETHING THAT WORRIES THE PUBLIC 
AS LONG AS THESE THINGS REMAIN 
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS THERE WILL BE 
CONCERNED 
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR CONCERNED M. P.'S 
MOST M. P.'S SIMPLY WANT THIS M. P.'S WHOLE MATTER TO BE PUT TO BED THE 
VAST MAJORITY SIMPLY CLAIM WHAT 
THEY ARE TOLD THEY CAN CLAIM THE 
SYSTEM IS BEING TIGHTENED UP FROM 
TODAY AN M. P. WITHOUT A RECEIPT CAN 
ONLY CLAIM UP TO TWENTY FIVE YESTERDAY IT 
WAS TOO LARGE AND FIFTY THE PROBLEM 
IS THAT THE MAN TAKING CHARGE OF 
TIGHTENING UP THESE AND 
INVESTIGATING THE SYSTEM IS NONE 
OTHER THAN THE SPEAKER SOME M. P.'S 
BELIEVE I PUT IT NO MORE THAN THAT 
THAT THE REASON HE IS STOPPING 
INVESTIGATION OF THE SYSTEM OR 
DISCLOSURE OF THE FULL FACTS OF 
M. P.S' EXPENSES IS THAT HE HIMSELF 
FEELS VULNERABLE TO THIS NOT MANY 
M. P.'S WILL SPEAK OUT ON THIS ISSUE AS 
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND ONE OF THE FEW 
THAT WILL IS NORMAN BAKER 
I THINK 
IF ANY M. P. IS FOUND GUILTY OF 
MISUSING PUBLIC MONEY THAT IS A 
SERIOUS MATTER AND SIR JOHN LYON 
WILL LOOK AT THESE MATTERS VERY 
THOROUGHLY AND COME UP WITH AN 
INDEPENDENT REPORT IT WOULD BE A 
SERIOUS MATTER FOR THE SPEAKER BUT 
AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING 
EVERYONE IS INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN 
GUILTY GUILTY A PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY HAS FOUND 
RECORD LEVELS OF IMMIGRATION ARE 
BRINGING LITTLE OR NO ECONOMIC 
BENEFIT TO BRITAIN THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS ECONOMIC AFFAIRS COMMITTEE 
SAYS IT HAS USED IRRELEVANT AND 
MISLEADING INFORMATION TO JUSTIFY 
ITS POLICIES THE REPORT CALLS FOR 
A CAP ON FUTURE IMMIGRATION 
IT WANTS TO SCALE DOWN THE NUMBER 
OF BRITISH TROOPS IN IRAQ THE 
CONTINGENT IN BASRA AND WILL STAY 
AT FOUR THOUSAND WHILE THE IRAQI SECURITY 
FORCES ARE FIGHTING THE SHI'ITE 
MILITIA MILITIA AT DES BROWNE ANNOUNCES THE CHANGES 
TO THE COMMONS THIS AFTERNOON 
SCIENTISTS AT NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY 
CLAIM TO HAVE MADE THE FIRST HYBRID 
EMBRYOS THEIR WORK IS INTENDED TO 
HELP TREAT ILLNESSES SUCH AS 
PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND ALZHEIMER'S 
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS DESCRIBED 
THE CREATION AS MONSTROUS 
THE 
THE CREATION AS MONSTROUS THE MARKET INVESTORS DARED TO HOPE 
THAT THE WORST OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
WAS OVER 
THE OLYMPIC FLAME LEFT BEIJING 
TODAY ON THE FIRST STAGE OF ITS 
JOURNEY BACK THERE TO SET OF THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES IN AUGUST THE 
CHINESE GOVERNMENT USED THE 
OCCASION TO SAY THIS WAS NO TIME 
FOR PROTEST ABOUT ITS HUMAN RIGHTS 
RECORD NO DANGER OF THAT IN THE 
FLAME'S FIRST POINT OF CALL 
KAZAKHSTAN THE CHINESE REALLY WANT 
US TO MARVEL AT THEIR RIVAL AS THE 
WORLD ECONOMIC POWER GROWTH OF ELEVEN 
PER CENT FOR EXAMPLE THEY ARE NOT EVEN 
VAGUELY ADDRESSING THAT THIS IS THE 
FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LAST 
ATTEMPT TO MODERNISE CHINA 
CHAIRMAN MAO'S GREAT LEAP FORWARD 
IN THE SECOND OF HIS MAJOR FILMS 
PAUL MASON REPORTS 
FIFTY YEARS AGO CHINA'S RULERS DREAMT 
OF A GREAT LEAP FORWARD THEY 
DREAMED OF STEEL AND MODERNITY OF 
MECHANISED AGRICULTURE RGS OF 
OUTSTRIPPING THE WEST IT ENDED IN 
DISASTER THIRTY MILLION DEAD FROM 
FAMINE GIANT AMBITION LED TO GIANT 
MISTAKES MISTAKES IN TODAY'S CHINA FUTURISTIC 
BLUEPRINTS BECOME REALITY THEY'RE 
GROWING FASTER THAN THE WEST 
BUILDING HIGHER BURYING THE MEMORY 
OF NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT UNDER LAYERS OF GLASS AND 
STEEL ONE FIFTH OF ALL HUE MANNITY 
IS CAUGHT UP IN THE BUZZ OF RISING 
WEALTH AND RISING ASPIRATION 
CHINA'S REAL GREAT LEAP FORWARD HAS 
HAPPENED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AS 
THE COUNTRY HAS BURST ONTO THE 
WORLD ECONOMY THE ACHIEVEMENT IS 
REAL AND FROM WHERE I'M STANDING 
SPECTACULAR BUT RAPID ECONOMIC 
GROWTH DIRECTED BY CENTRAL STATE 
BRINGS CONTRADICTIONS THESE ARE 
NOW BEING FELT IN THE ENVIRONMENT 
IN POLITICS AND IN THE ECONOMY 
ITSELF IN SHANGHAI THEY'RE 
FINISHING OFF THE TALLEST BUILDING 
IN THE WORLD THE SCALE OF CHINA'S 
AMBITION REVEALED IN THE NAME THE 
WORLD FINANCIAL CENTRE THIS IS 
WHAT ELEVEN PER CENT ECONOMIC GROWTH LOOKS LIKE 
DIZYING AND RELENTLESS BUT THE 
ECONOMY IS STILL HYBRID OF THE 
MARKET AND THE PLAN AND THE CRACKS 
ARE SHOWING COULD IT BE THAT ONE 
FATAL YEAR HALF CENTURY AGO CONTAINS LESSON FOR TODAY 
PROBLEM NUMBER ONE THE ECONOMY IS 
OVERHEATING INFLATION NOW IS EIGHTY SEVEN PER CENT 
FOOD PRICES ARE UP TWENTY THREE PER CENT BUT IT'S 
ONLY IN PLACES LIKE THIS THAT YOU 
REALISE WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE 
LOWEST PAID 
THE PRICE GOES UP ALMOST DOUBLE 
THE PRICE OF CLOTHES IS DOUBLING 
YEAH 
AT THIS WHOLESALE MARKET ON YEAH THE OUTSKIRTS OF SHANGHAI BUSINESS 
IS LACK IN JUST A FEW MONTHS 
INFLATION HAS WIPED OUT THE FEEL 
GOOD FACTOR 
FOR THE FIRST TIME PEOPLE AT THIS 
MARKET ARE FEELING THE EFFECT OF 
MARKET FORCES 
SO IS THE CHINESE ECONOMY AT 
FAULT THE SHORT ANSWER TO THAT IS 
YES CHINA IS OVERHEATING AND THE 
AGRICULTURE SYSTEM IS NOT 
RESPONDING TO DEMAND FARMLAND IS 
SHRINKING AND SO IS THE RURAL 
WORKFORCE 
THIS MAN IS ONE OF A NEW BREED OF 
WESTERN EDUCATED COMMUNIST LEADERS 
HE KNOWS INFLATION IS HITTING THE 
POOREST HARDEST 
INFLATION AS YOU MENTIONED IS 
HURTING THESE LESS FORTUNATE PEOPLE 
MORE THAT'S WHAT GOVERNMENT HAS 
PUT SO MUCH EMPHASIS ON CONTROLLING 
INFLATION THE DANGER FOR CHINA TO 
FLY TOO HIGH AND SUDDENLY CRASH ON 
ONE DIRECTION OR ANOTHER 
YOU KNOW 
ON THE MARKET INTERACTION OR ON THE 
CONTROLLED INTERACTION THAT RISK 
IN REALITY ACTUALLY IS NOT THAT 
HIGH OUR FORM OF GOVERNMENT HAS 
ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO MAKE TIMELY 
RESPONSES TO ALL KINDS OF SHOCKS 
AND EVENTS 
BUT THERE MAY BE MORE 
SHOCKS AND EVENTS AHEAD EASY MONEY 
IS SWILLING AROUND IN THE COCKTAIL 
BARS AND FASHION DISTRICTS IT'S 
COMING OUT OF THE STOCK EXCHANGE 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE HAVE RISKED 
THEIR SAVINGS ON THE STOCK MARKET 
SHARES HAVE RISEN FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT IN JUST FOUR 
YEARS ALL THE SIGNS ARE THERE OF A 
FINANCIAL BUBBLE THAT COULD BE 
ABOUT TO BURST 
MEET THE NEW KIND OF CHINESE 
CAPITALIST THESE WOMEN HAVE PUT 
MOST OF THEIR SAVINGS ONTO THE 
STOCK EXCHANGE THESE TWO HAVE QUIT 
THEIR DAY JOBS TO TRADE SHARES AND 
THEY'RE ALREADY MILLIONAIRES YOU 
DON'T RELY ON WE CALL IT A GURU A 
WISE MAN TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO 
WISE MAN NO NO DON'T BELIEVE 
WISE MAN BECAUSE I THINK I'M THE 
WISE WOMAN 
WE CALL IT BULL MARKET 
BULL MARKET 
YES WE HAVE TO TAKE 
THE CHANCE WE CAN'T LET IT GO 
WHAT IF THE BULL BITES BACK WHAT 
IF IT ALL COLLAPSES WHILE YOU'RE 
STILL HOLDING SHARES JOOF COURSE 
IT WILL COLLAPSE BUT NOW WE 
BELIEVE FOR A SHORT TIME OR SOME 
TIME A PERIOD IT WILL STILL MAYBE 
THIS LINE UP 
NOW THIS ALARMED ME IT REMINDED ME 
OF JUST BEFORE THE DOTCOM CRASH 
DECIDED TO TRY OUT A BIT OF 
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IS EVERYBODY 
AWARE OF THE CONCEPT OF THE PRICE 
TO EARNINGS RATIO DO YOU KNOW THAT 
CONCEPT WHAT'S THE CHINESE FOR 
THAT THE PRICE TO EARNINGS RATIO 
MEASURES SHARE PRICES AGAINST 
COMPANY PROFITS IN CHINA IT'S BEEN 
UNFEESABLY HIGH SIGNALLING CRASH 
IT TURNED OUT OF COURSE THEY DO 
KNOW ABOUT IT IT'S JUST THAT THEY 
DON'T BELIEVE IT MATTERS 
BUT HOW DO THEY KNOW WHICH STOCKS 
TO HOLD IT WAS ONLY THEN I 
REALISED HOW THEY WERE CHOOSING 
THEM POLITICALLY WHICH COMPANY 
HAS POLITICAL BACKING WHICH CAN 
NEVER BE ALLOWED TO FAIL FANG KING 
HAI USED TO RUN THE SHANGHAI STOCK 
EXCHANGE IS HE WORRIED THE BUBBLE 
IS ABOUT TO BURST 
THE STOCK MARKET 
STILL IS A WORRY FOR SOME RB 
REASON PEOPLE'S INVESTMENT 
CONFIDENCE DISAPPEARED ALL OF A 
SUDDEN YOU WOULD SEE A COLLAPSE OF 
THE MARKET THAT WOULD HURT TENS OF 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THE GOVERNMENT 
IS MAKING SURE THERE IS NO SUDDEN 
LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN THE STOCK 
MARKET 
IT'S A RARE GOVERNMENT THAT MARKET CAN ACHIEVE THAT 
WELL WHEN YOU 
HAVE A VERY HIGH VALUATION LIKE FIFTY 
TIMES OR ONE HUNDRED TIMES THEN NO 
GOVERNMENT CAN PREVENT A COLLAPSE 
FROM HAPPENING EVERY GOVERNMENT 
WANT IF THERE'S A BUBBLE THEY WANT 
TO SEE AIR LET AIR OUT GRADUALLY 
HOW THE CHINESE ECONOMIC BUBBLE 
ENDS DEPENDS A LOT ON HOW THE 
GOVERNMENT HANDLES THINGS WHEN YOU 
LEAVE THE GLITTER OF SHANGHAI AND 
JOURNEY INTO THE OLD INDUSTRIAL 
HEART OF CHINA SUDDENLY YOU BEGIN 
TO UNDERSTAND IT MAY NOT BE THE 
ECONOMY THAT FACES THE BIGGEST 
DANGER 
CHAIRMAN MAO PREPARED THE ORIGINAL 
GREAT LEAP FORWARD WITH A SWIM 
ACROSS THE YANGTSE RIVER IT WAS 
GESTURE HE REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES 
FOR THE CAMERAS TO SHOW HE WAS THE 
MAIN MAN AND THE COMMUNIST PARTY 
WAS IN HARMONY WITH NATURE AND THE 
PEOPLE CLOSE TO WHERE CHAIRMAN MAO 
SWAM THEY'RE STILL SWIMMING BUT 
WHAT MAO UNLEASHED HERE WAS NOT 
HARMONIOUS AND NEITHER IS WHAT'S 
HAPPENING NOW DOES HE REMEMBER 
WHEN CHAIRMAN MAO SWAM IN THIS 
RIVER 
HE WAS ONE OF THEM HE RIVER JOINED HIM 
YOU WERE THIS MAN WAS 
A DIVISION COMMANDER IN THE 
PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY 
ON THE DAY MAO SWAM HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS 
OLD AND HE REMEMBERS EVERY DETAIL 
THIS GENERATION WHICH HAS LIVED 
THROUGH MANY UPHEAVALS S. NOW 
SEEING ONE OF THE BIGGEST UPHEAVALS 
OF ALL THE YANGTSE IS NOW AT ITS 
LOWEST LEVEL FOR ONE HUNDRED FORTY YEARS THIS 
RIVER SUPPLIES ONE THIRD OF CHINA'S 
DRINKING WATER AND IT'S DYING 
THANK YOU THANK YOU 
WHEN IT'S A BIT WARMER I'LL COME IN 
WITH YOU 
IN THE ORIGINAL GREAT LEAP FORWARD 
MAO ORDERED SPARROWS TO BE 
ERADICATED A PLAGUE OF LOCUSTS 
FOLLOWED HE DECREED CROPS SHOULD 
BE SOWN ACCORD TO SOVIET SCIENCE 
CROPS FAILED HE TOLD PEOPLE TO 
PRODUCE STEEL IN THEIR OWN 
BACKYARDS FORESTS WERE DESTROYED 
VITAL TOOLS WERE MELTED DOWN THIRTY 
MILLION PEOPLE DIED IN FAMINE 
TODAY THERE ARE NO MORE FOOD QUEUES 
BUT THE SHADOW OF NATURAL DISASTER 
HAS NOT GONE AWAY AND JUST LIKE FIFTY 
YEARS AGO IT IS MAN MADE THE 
PRODUCT OF GIANT GESTURES BY AN 
ALL POWERFUL STATE THIS COUPLE 
HAVE BEEN FISHING THE YANGTSE FOR 
SIXTY YEARS THEY LIVE ON THEIR BOAT 
NINE MONTHS A YEAR SO THEY KNOW 
EVERY SAND BANK FOR TWO HUNDRED MILES THE 
TROUBLE IS 
A LOT MORE 
SAND BANKS THAN THERE USED TO BE 
FOR A THIRD OF ITS LENGTH THE 
YANGTSE IS IRREVERSABLY POLLUTED 
FOR THEM ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS BEEN 
A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD 
NOW INSTEAD OF FISH THEY LIVE BY 
COLLECTING SCRAP METAL AND INDEED 
SCRAP ANYTHING CHINESE SCIENTISTS 
SAY WITHIN SEVEN YEARS THIS ONE OF 
THE WORLD'S GREAT RIVERS COULD BE 
TECH NICKALLY DEAD WHEN WE THINK 
OF THE GREAT LEAP FORWARD WE TEND 
TO SEE IT AS AN ECONOMIC DISASTER 
BUT CHINESE PEOPLE REMEMBER IT ALSO 
AS A ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER THAT 
MAKES IT ALL TOO RELEVANT TO TODAY 
BECAUSE CHINA'S MODERN SUCCESS HAS 
LEFT AN INDELLIBLE MARK ON NATURE 
THIS BIT WHERE I'M STANDING USED TO 
BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YANGTSE 
YET HERE THEY'RE BUILDING A BRIDGE 
OVER A RIVER THAT BARELY EXISTS 
BREAK NECK ECONOMIC GROWTH MINIMAL 
PLANNING LAWS MAVERICK LOCAL 
OFFICIALS AND CORRUPTION THAT'S 
WHAT'S SQUEEZING THE LIFE OUT OF 
CHINA'S GREAT RIVERS BUT IN THE 
PAST TWELVE MONTHS SOMETHING'S CHANGED 
IN SOUTH EAST CHINA THERE WAS A 
MASS PROTEST AGAINST PLANS TO BUILD 
A POLLUTING BATTERY PLANT WHEN 
THEY RELOCATED THE PLANT RIOTS 
BROKE OUT THERE AS WELL EVEN IN 
SHANGHAI THERE HAVE BEEN PROTESTS 
THIS ONE OVER THE PLAN TO BUILD AN 
EXTENSION TO THE CITY'S HIGH SPEED 
MAGLEV TRAIN SUDDENLY OUT OF 
NOWHERE CHINA'S RULERS ARE FACING 
A GRASSROOTS PROTEST MOVEMENT OVER 
THE ENVIRONMENT AND UP TO NOW CHINA HAS TREATED 
COPE UP TO NOW CHINA HAS TREATED ALL DISSENT EQUALLY AS A THREAT TO 
SOCIAL ORDER BUT THE NEED FOR 
SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
CALLS FOR A MORE SUBTLE POLITICS 
FIFTY YEARS AGO THOSE WHO QUESTIONED 
THE GREAT LEAP FORWARD WERE 
LABELLED RIGHTISTS HALF A MILLION 
WERE PURGED TODAY THE COMMUNIST 
PARTY'S HOLD ON POWER IS JUST AS 
TIGHT AS IT WAS IN THE PAST THE 
SURVIVING VICTIMS OF NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT ARE STILL 
CAMPAIGNING FOR JUSTICE THERE WERE 
MARKET SOCIALISTS BEFORE THEIR TIME 
SURELY THEY NOW WOULD BE SEEN AS 
VISIONARIES BY THE PRESENT 
GOVERNMENT WELL ACTUALLY NO 
THIS MAN WAS A BIOLOGY LECTURER AT 
BEIJING UNIVERSITY WHEN MAO ASKED 
INTELLECTUALS TO CRITICISE THE 
PARTY TO LET ONE HUNDRED FLOWERS BLOOM 
HE WAS SACKED AND FORCED TO WORK IN 
A FACTORY FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS FOR ALL 
THAT TIME NOBODY TOOK HIS 
PHOTOGRAPH HIS LIFE DESTROYED HE 
IS PREPARED TO DRAW LESSONS FROM 
THE GREAT LEAP FORWARD THAT FEW 
OTHERS WILL VOICE 
THE PROFESSOR WANTED TO SHOW US 
WHERE DURING THE GREAT LEAP 
FORWARD HE HAD DEBATED DEMOCRACY 
AT THE UNIVERSITY IT SOON BECAME 
CLEAR WE WERE NOT ALONE THIS 
SECRET POLICE CAR TAILED US FOR 
HALF AN HOUR I'M HERE AT THE SOE 
CALLED TRIANGLE IN BEIJING 
UNIVERSITY IT'S WHERE THE 
PROFESSOR DISCUSSED DEMOCRACY IN 
THE OPEN IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT IT'S WHERE THE 
STUDENTS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE ALSO PUT THEIR 
BANNERS UP TO CALL FOR DEMOCRACY 
BUT ON OUR JOURNEY HERE THIS BLACK 
SUDAN CAR BEHIND US FOLLOWED US THE 
ENTIRE WAY SO WE CAN'T RISK THE 
PROFESSOR BEING SEEN IN PUBLIC 
BEING FILMED BY THE FOREIGN MEDIA 
THEY FILMED US WE FILMED THEM 
THREE OTHER VETERANS OF NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT WHO'D 
AGREED TO SPEAK TO ME WERE PLACED 
UNDER HOUSE ARREST SO JEALOUSLY 
DOES THE COMMUNIST PARTY GUARD ITS 
MONOPOLY OF POWER THAT FIFTY YEARS ON 
FROM THE GREAT LEAP FORWARD 
VICTIMS OF IT ARE HARASSED SIMPLY 
FOR CAMPAIGNING TO CLEAR THEIR 
NAMES IN BEIJING THEY'RE PUTTING 
THE FINAL GLOSS ON THE OLYMPIC 
STADIUM THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
GREAT LEAP FORWARD WILL BE 
FORGOTTEN AMID THE OLYMPIC 
CELEBRATIONS BUT ITS RELEVANCE 
REMAINS EVEN THE OLD DEBATE STATE 
VERSUS MARKET IS STILL RAGING BUT 
AS BEFORE IT REMAINS A DISCUSSION 
BETWEEN CHINA'S RULERS NOT ITS 
PEOPLE 
WE DO NOT SEE VOCAL PEOPLE CRITICISM BUT WITHIN THE 
GOVERNMENT THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF 
DIFFERENT DISCUSSIONS THERE ARE 
DIFFERENT FACTIONS I MEAN IF I CAN 
USE THAT WORD DIFFERENT GROUPS OF 
PEOPLE THAT ARE THINKING 
DIFFERENTLY ONE FACTION OR ONE WAY 
WOULD SAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
SHOULD PLAY A MUCH SMALLER ROLE 
THAN IT HAS BEEN PLAYING THE OTHER 
SAYS THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE 
PLAYING A MORE ROLE THAN IT HAS 
BEEN PLAYING THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE 
YOU JUST DON'T THINK IF YOU HAD 
THESE DEBATES MORE SHORPLY AND MORE 
PUBLICLY IT MIGHT HELP CLARIFY 
THEM 
NO I DON'T THINK SO YOU CAN THEM NEVER CLARIFY THESE REAL WORLD 
ISSUES BY DEBATES I'M A FIRM 
BELIEVING IN THE APPROACH DON'T 
DEBATE JUST DO IT THE RESULTS OF 
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN A FEW YEARS 
WILL TEACH PEOPLE AND WILL 
ILLUMINATE THE WAY FORWARD THAT THAT FORMULA HAS BEEN SPECTACULARLY 
SUCCESSFUL UP TO NOW BUT THE 
ECONOMY AND THE ENVIRONMENT ARE 
POSING CHALLENGES THAT MAY 
INTENSIFY ONCE THE OLYMPIC JAMBOREE 
IS OVERMENT TO THE OUTSIDE EYE 
CHINA ALREADY LOOKS LIKE A 
SUCCESSFUL MARKET ECONOMY IN 
REALITY THERE IS STILL A GIANT HAND 
PULLING GIANT LEVERS AND HAVING A 
GIANT IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S LIVES 
IT'S NOT ALWAYS PREDICTABLE 
NOR IS IT ALWAYS JUST THE WORLD 
HAS TO HOPE IT IS NO LONGER CAPABLE 
OF MAKING GIANT MISTAKES 
LORD PATTEN WAS THE U. K.'S LAST 
GOVERNOR OF HONG KONG BEFORE ITS 
HAND OVER TO CHINA L. ASKED HIM 
WHAT HE SAW AS CHINA'S GREATEST 
IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS 
I THINK THE 
CHINESE ARE RUNNING INTO A FEW ROAD 
BLOCKS WHICH WERE VERY WELL CAUGHT 
IN THAT FILM WHICH WAS A BIT 
PESSIMISTIC BUT NEVERTHELESS 
SOCIAL EQUITY THE ENVIRONMENT AND 
CHINA'S EXISTENTIAL QUESTION HOW 
YOU CAN MAKE A POLITICAL SYSTEM 
ACCOMMODATE WHAT'S HAPPENING 
ECONOMICALLY AND SOCIALLY THOSE 
ARE GOING TO BE FACTORS IN THE 
YEARS AHEAD THERE IS A CENTRAL 
QUESTION WHICH I THINK SOMETIMES 
BUBBLES UP IN THE CHINESE DEBATE 
ON THE ONE HAND THE PARTY HARD 
LINERS SAY WE CAN'T GO ON GIVING UP 
CONTROL OVER THE ECONOMY BECAUSE 
IF WE DO THAT WE'LL GIVE UP 
CONTROL OF THE STATE WE'LL LOSE 
CONTROL OF THE STATE ON THE OTHER 
SIDE THE MODERNISERS SAY UNLESS 
WE GO ON GIVING UP CONTREL OVER THE 
ECONOMY WE WON'T CONTINUE GROWING 
AND WE WILL LOSE CONTROL OF THE 
STATES BOTH SIDES OF THAT ARGUMENT 
ARE CORRECT THAT'S THE DILEMMA 
THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES THERE ARE 
ENORMOUS IS IT YOUR HUNCH THEY 
COULD PROVOID CATALYST FOR 
POLITICAL CHANGE 
I THINK THAT WHAT 
THEY'RE START TO CREATE IS A SENSE 
OF CIVIL SOCIETY WHICH IS THE WAY 
DEMOCRACY ARRIVES AND THE WAY 
CHANGE IS PEACEFULLY ENGINEERED 
THERE'S UNDOUBTEDLY AN 
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTOR IN THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL PROTESTS AT 
THE MOMENT CHINA IS THE BIGGEST 
EMITER OF CARBON IN THE WORLD 
BIGGER THAN ANYBODY ELSE THERE IS 
NO REALLY EFFECTIVE SUCCESSOR TO 
KYOTO UNLESS THERE IS A DEAL 
BETWEEN CHINA AND ABOVE ALL THE 
UNITED STATES THAT'S WHAT THE NEXT 
STAGE IN WORLD HISTORY SHOULD BE 
PRIMARILY ABOUT 
DO YOU SEE ANY 
EVIDENCE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS 
REALLY APPRISED OF THE NEED TO DO 
SOMETHING SERIOUS ABOUT ITS CARBON 
EMISSIONS 
YEAH I DO BUT I THINK EMISSIONS THAT EVEN THOUGH SEVENTY PER CENT OF ENERGY IS 
COAL SEVEN THOUSAND NEW CARS ROLLING OUT 
ONTO THE CHINESE ROAD SYSTEM EVERY 
DAY FROM NOW UNTIL TWO THOUSAND THIRTY L. MEAN IF 
YOU BELIEVE STATISTICS THAT'S WHAT 
THEY SAY L. THINK THE CHINESE 
LEADERSHIP DO UNDERSTAND AND AS 
WITH MANY OTHER ISSUES ARE TRYING 
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BUT 
THERE'S A SENSE IN WHICH THAT IS 
STILL THE PROBLEM FOR GOVERNMENTS 
ACTUALLY MAKING THINGS HAPPEN ON 
THE GROUND 
IT IS A TOTALITARIAN 
STATE THE OLYMPICS ARE COMING UP 
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO SAY 
BECAUSE OF ITS TOTALITARIAN 
BEHAVIOUR POLITICAL OPPRESSION 
TIBET THE REST OF IT THERE SHOULD 
BE A BOYCOTT OF THE OPENING 
CEREMONY DO YOU THINK GORDON BROWN 
SHOULD GO 
YEAH I THINK GORDON 
BROWN SHOULD GO AND SHOULD DEVELOP 
HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA UNLIKE 
HIS LAST VISIT HE SHOULD RAISE 
HUMAN RIGHTS WHEN HE'S THERE L. 
DON'T THINK THE RIGHT WAY TO TREAT 
CHINA IS TO INSULT IT L. DON'T 
THINK THE RIGHT WAY TO TREAT CHINA 
IS TO TRY AND ISOLATE THEM HOW CAN 
YOU ISOLATE TWELVE BILLION PEOPLE THE 
RIGHT WAY TO DEAL WITH CHINA IS BY 
TRYING TO DRAW THEM INTO THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TRY TO 
BEHAVE AS PARTNERS WITH THEM BUT 
NEVER EVER TO GIVE UP ON SETTING 
OUT HOW OUR VALUES DIFFER FROM 
THEIRS 
WOULD YOU PROTEST WHEN THE THEIRS OLYMPIC TORCH PASSES THROUGH 
EUROPE 
WHILE I'M GETTING A BIT OLD EUROPE TO FIND MYSELF ON PICKET LINES I 
HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO ARGUMENT AGAINST 
ANYBODY WHO POINTS OUT HOW SHOOTING 
TIBETAN MONKS ISN'T ACTUALLY A VERY 
CONFIDENT WAY OF EXPRESSING THAT 
YOU'VE BECOME A SUPERPOWER L. THINK 
THAT MOMENTOUS WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN 
CHINA HAS BEEN BUT THE NERVOUSNESS 
THAT THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES HAVE 
ABOUT ANY SHOW OF DISSENT IS AN 
INDICATION OF THE CREEKINESS OF THE 
AUTOCRATIC SINCE TEM THERE 
YOU CAN SEE PAUL'S OTHER REPORT 
FROM CHINA ON THE WORKFORCE THAT 
CHANGED THE WORLD ON OUR WEBSITE 
LET'S HAVE LOOK AT SOME OF 
TOMORROW TOMORROW MORNING'S FRONT PAGES THE 
INDEPENDENT USES THE WORD END 
GAME TO DESCRIBE WHAT'S HAPPENING 
WITH ROBERT MUGABE IN ZIMBABWE THE 
SAME WORD IS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF 
THE TIMES AND THE GUARDIAN SAYS 
ZIMBABWE IS ON PRECIPICE AS 
PRESSURE GROWS ON MUGABE THE 
FINANCIAL TIMES APPARENTLY WE 
SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS HAVEN'T YOU GOT 
A COPY OF THIS I'LL HOLD IT UP WE 
SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS BECAUSE THE 
MARKETS MAY NOT RECOVER AS QUICKLY 
AS SOME PEOPLE HOPE THE DAILY MAIL 
THAT'S THE FRONT PAGE MILLIONS 
OF GIRLS AT RISK ONLINE AND 
APPARENTLY NATASHA KAPLINSKI IS 
GOING TO BE HAVING BABY THAT'S 
ALL FOR TONIGHT I'LL BE HERE AGAIN 
TOMORROW L. HOPE YOU CAN FIND 
MOMENT IN YOUR BUSY LIFE TO JOIN US
