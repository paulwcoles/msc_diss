I AM GEORGE ALAGIAH IN JOHANNESBURG THE FIGHTBACK BEGINS ZIMBABWE'S 
RULING PARTY SAYS IT IS READY TO 
UNLEASH ITS FULL FORCE ROBERT 
MUGABE APPEARS ON TELEVISION FOR 
THE FIRST TIME IN SEVERAL DAYS 
THERE IS TALK OF A SECOND ROUND OF 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS 
I AM DAVID EADES IN LONDON MORE 
NATO TROOPS FOR THE SHARP END IN 
AFGHANISTAN BUT HOW MANY FORCES 
DOES THE ALLIANCE REALLY NEED 
CHINA JAILS A LEADING HUMAN RIGHTS 
ACTIVIST FOR INCITING SUBVERSION 
ANOTHER SIGN OF AN OLYMPIC 
CRACKDOWN CRACKDOWN AND TAKING A SLICE OUT OF THE 
SALMON MARKET OR FILLETING AN 
INDUSTRY THE CHOICE FOR THE U. S. TO 
SAVE STOCKS OFF THE PACIFIC COAST 
GOOD EVENING FROM JOHANNESBURG 
IN ZIMBABWE THE OFFICIAL RESULTS 
FOR THE FIRST ROUND OF THE 
PRESIDENTIAL POLLS HAVE YET TO BE 
PUBLISHED INSIDE THE COUNTRY THERE 
IS ALREADY TALK THAT THEY MIGHT 
NEED A SECOND ROUND A SECOND ROUND 
RUN OFF IN THE PRESIDENTIAL POLL 
SO IF THERE WERE ANY ZIMBABWEANS 
NAIVE ENOUGH TO THINK THAT ROBERT 
MUGABE WOULD GIVE UP WITHOUT A 
FIGHT THEY NEED TO THINK AGAIN 
HIS SPOKESMAN SAID TODAY THAT THE 
RULING PARTY ZANU P. F. WAS READY TO 
UNLEASH ITS FULL FORCE IN ORDER TO 
ENSURE THAT ROBERT MUGABE COULD 
LOOK FORWARD TO A FOURTH DECADE 
IMAGINE THAT A FOURTH DECADE IN 
POWER THAT WILL RING ALARM BELLS 
AMONG ZIMBABWEANS WHO KNOW WHAT 
THE ZANU P. F. PARTY IS LIKE WHEN IT 
IS AT FULL THROTTLE THEY REMEMBER 
THE VIOLENCE THAT HAS GONE ALONG 
WITH PAST ELECTION CAMPAIGNS OUR 
REPORT TONIGHT IS FROM KAREN ALLEN 
THE FIRST TELEVISION PICTURES OF 
ROBERT MUGABE SINCE SATURDAY'S VOTE 
A MAN FACING THE BIGGEST POLITICAL 
TEST OF HIS LIFE YET FAR FROM 
BEING A LEADER LOOKING FOR A WAY 
OUT HE SEEMS TO BE PREPARING TO 
FIGHT THE MESSAGE FROM HIS INNER 
CIRCLE DON'T BE FOOLED BY WHAT 
YOU HAVE SEEN UNTIL NOW 
WE ONLY 
PUT IN TWENTY FIVE PER CENT WE HAVE SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT IN OUR 
RESERVES TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS 
TIME IT WILL BE A RESOUNDING 
VICTORY FOR THE PRESIDENT THE THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE HAVE FOLLOWED 
EVERY TWIST AND TURN IN THIS 
ELECTION DRAMA THOUGH THE 
OPPOSITION CLAIMS IT HAS WON THE 
PRESIDENTIAL RACE STATE MEDIA 
CONCEDES IT WILL PROBABLY GOING TO 
A SECOND ROUND BEHIND CLOSED DOORS 
THE TOP BRASS OF THE RULING PARTY 
ARE PREPARING TO MEET INSIDERS 
CLAIM THAT ZANU P. F. IS SPLIT OVER 
THE NEXT MOVE WHETHER TO GO HEAD 
TO HEAD WITH THE OPPOSITION'S 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI OR TO REACH SOME 
SORT OF DEAL PEOPLE ARE NERVOUS 
ABOUT WHAT COULD COME NEXT BUT 
BELIEVE CHANGES AROUND THE CORNER 
AFTER ALL FOR THE FIRST TIME 
ZANU P. F. HAS LOST ITS CONTROL OF 
PARLIAMENT 
SO FAR I AM HAPPY WITH PARLIAMENT 
THE RESULTS EVEN THOUGH WE DID NOT 
WIN RESOUNDINGLY AS WE EXPECTED 
BUT I THINK IT WAS TIME FOR A 
CHANGE WE REALLY NEED A CHANGE 
THE ECONOMY IS SO LOW EBB WE ARE 
HOPING FOR SOMETHING WHICH REVIVES 
THE ECONOMY 
THE STREETS ARE ALIVE 
WITH RUMOURS THAT OPPOSITION RULE 
COULD SEE THE RETURN OF WHITE 
FARMERS BACKED BY THE U. K. OR 
PRESIDENTIAL RUN OFF COULD SIGNAL 
MORE MILITARY BEING BROUGHT IN THE 
WORLD'S FOCUS IS STILL DIRECTED AT 
ZIMBABWE ITS PEOPLE ARE EAGER FOR 
A RESULT 
LET'S TRY TO PUT SOME OF THAT INTO 
CONTEXT I HAVE WITH ME IN THE 
STUDIO DOCTOR XOLELA MANGCU A 
POLITICAL ANALYST IN JOHANNESBURG 
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US WHAT 
DO YOU THINK IS GOING ON IN THE 
RULING ZANU P. F. PARTY WITH ALL THIS 
TALK OF A FIGHTBACK UNLEASHING ITS 
FULL FORCE 
HISTORICALLY ROBERT 
MUGABE HAS ALWAYS DONE WHAT HE SAYS 
SO THAT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY 
HOWEVER I DO THINK IT IS A 
BARGAINING TACTIC OF SORTS I DO 
THINK THAT HE HAS COME TO THE 
REALISATION THAT HE HAS TO 
NEGOTIATE WITH THE MDGS SEA AND HE 
IS TRYING TO SECURE THE BEST WAY 
OUT THE M. D. C. I CANNOT SEE ZANU 
P. F. BEING UNITED BEHIND HIM IN AN 
ONSLAUGHT ON THE POPULATION AT THIS 
POINT I THINK IT IS TOO LATE FOR 
THAT 
THAT IS THE KEY POINT YOU THAT 
ARE SAYING IT AND OUR REPORTER 
MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE TALKS OF 
SPLITS WITHIN THE PARTY ARE YOU 
SAYING THAT IF HE TRIED HE WOULD 
NOT BE ABLE TO RELY ON THE FULL 
MIGHT OF THE PARTY BEHIND HIM 
THERE COULD STILL BE BLOOD ON THE 
GROUND 
AS BAD AS THAT 
IF 
HE SAYS GROUND HE WILL TAKE THE FULL MIGHT OF THE 
ARMY ON THE POPULATION THAT IS 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN I JUST THINK 
THERE WILL BE OTHERS WHO WILL NOT 
GO ALONG WITH THAT OTHERS WHO WILL 
RESIST THAT BUT THE CONSEQUENCES 
WOULD BE DIRE AND FOR THE REGION 
AS WELL BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE WOULD 
START FLEEING TO SOUTH AFRICA 
BOTSWANA AND OTHER NEIGHBOURING 
COUNTRIES SO WE NEED AN ORIGINAL 
SOLUTION A REGIONAL SOLUTION IF IF THE RULING PARTY IS NOT UNITED AND 
THERE ARE FACTIONS CAN YOU 
DESCRIBE WHAT THEY MIGHT BE FIRST FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE SIMBA 
MAKONI WHO AS WHO HAS 
SUPPORTERS WITHIN THE PARTY HE HE STOOD AS AN INDEPENDENT 
YES THEN 
THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH VARIOUS 
BUSINESS INTERESTS THAT IS ALSO 
WHAT IS ABOUT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT 
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE ARMY WHO 
ARE NOT ROBERT MUGABE'S BEST 
FRIENDS SO I SUSPECT THAT THE ARMY 
WILL BE DIVIDED ALONG DIFFERENT 
PERSONALITIES GOING FORWARD 
ANOTHER THING THAT WE HAVE NOTICED 
SITTING IN JOHANNESBURG AND 
MONITORING THE NEWSPAPERS AND THE 
MEDIA IN ZIMBABWE IS THAT TODAY 
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF ARTICLES 
ABOUT WHITE FARMERS GOING BACK INTO 
ZIMBABWE READY TO RECLAIM THEIR 
LAND WHICH WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM 
THEM BY ROBERT MUGABE WHAT IS 
GOING ON WITH THOSE ARTICLES FIRST FIRST 
OF ALL I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD 
HELP THE SITUATION VERY MUCH AND 
COULD HELP MUGABE TO GO BACK TO HIS 
RHETORIC ABOUT WHITE FARMERS AND 
THE COLONIALISTS AND ALL OF THAT I 
THINK LET'S DEAL WITH THE 
ELECTION'S FIRST AND FIGURE OUT 
WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE 
ELECTIONS AND THEN THE PROCESS OF 
RECONSTRUCTION AND PEOPLE GOING 
BACK WOULD BE THE NEXT ITEM ON THE 
AGENDA BUT I THINK RIGHT NOW IS 
THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS HAPPENING 
WITH THE ELECTIONS 
SO FAR WE HAVE 
TALKED ABOUT THE RULING PARTY WHAT 
ABOUT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI AND THE 
M. D. C. WHAT SHOULD IT BE DOING AT THE 
MOMENT AFTER ALL THIS IS A 
CHALLENGE FOR IT THAT IS THE FOURTH 
ELECTION IT HAS CONTESTED AND IT 
HAS TO TRY AND PUSH HOME THE 
ADVANTAGE 
I DO NOT THINK THEY WILL ADVANTAGE LIE DOWN AND ROLL OVER THAT IS THE 
TRAGEDY OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF 
MUGABE THAT HIS FORCES ON THE 
PEOPLE I THINK THE M. D. C. IS SO 
ORGANISED AND THE PEOPLE SO 
MOBILISE THAT THEY WOULD RESIST 
THAT I HAVE THAT SENSE THAT PEOPLE 
WOULD DEFY MUGABE AND IT WOULD BE A 
TERRIBLE TRAGEDY 
THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH FOR BEING WITH US AS HE WAS 
SAYING THERE IS THE PROSPECT IF 
THERE IS A SECOND ROUND IF THE 
RULING PARTY DOES GO FULL THROTTLE 
THERE IS THE PROSPECT OF VIOLENCE 
HAVING REPORTED ON THE DEMISE OF 
OTHER DESPOTIC REGIMES AROUND 
AFRICA I CERTAINLY CAN ATTEST TO 
THE FACT THAT THESE COULD BE SOME 
OF THE MOST UNPREDICTABLE TIMES 
THAT ZIMBABWEANS HAVE EVER FACED 
BACK TO YOU 
THANK YOU 
NOW LET'S CATCH UP ON THE REST OF 
THE NEWS 
THE BIGGEST EVER NATO SUMMIT HAS 
BEEN TAKING PLACE IN BUCHAREST 
FACING UP TO SOME OF ITS BIGGEST 
CHALLENGES TOP OF THE LIST 
AFGHANISTAN AND FOR ONCE SOME 
SENSE OF UNITY AS FRANCE HAS 
COMMITTED AN EXTRA BATTALION OF 
TROOPS EASING THE TENSIONS BETWEEN 
COUNTRIES WHOSE SOLDIERS ARE ON THE 
FRONT LINE AGAINST THE TALEBAN AND 
THOSE COUNTRIES KEEPING THEIR 
DISTANCE FROM THE BOMBS AND BULLETS 
IN THE LONGER TERM SOME MAJOR 
DECISIONS TAKEN NATO WILL PUSH 
AHEAD WITH THE MISSILE DEFENCE 
SHIELD IN EUROPE BUT WILL NOT 
INVITE UKRAINE OR GEORGIA TO JOIN 
THEM NOT YET CAROLINE WYATT HAS 
THIS REPORT 
THERE WAS GOOD NEWS FOR THE 
DELEGATIONS FROM ALBANIA AND 
CROATIA AS NATO OFFERED BOTH AN 
INVITATION TO JOIN THE ALLIANCE 
YOU COME FROM A REGION WHICH HAS 
BEEN AFFECTED BY TERRIBLE CONFLICTS 
UNTIL ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO AND 
THAT IS WHY YOUR MEMBERSHIP AS A 
SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE WE ARE VERY 
GLAD TO HAVE YOU WITH US A WARM 
WELCOME 
BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT WELCOME THOUGH FOR MACEDONIA ITS HOPES OF 
JOINING WERE DASHED BY GREEK 
OBJECTIONS FIRST THE TWO 
COUNTRIES MUST RESOLVE A DISPUTE 
OVER MACEDONIA'S NAME WHICH GREECE 
SAYS IMPLIES A TERRITORIAL CLAIM TO 
THE NORTHERN PROVINCE OF THE SAME 
NAME THE MACEDONIAN DELEGATION 
WALKED OUT IN DISGUST DESPITE 
BACKING FROM THE U. S. UKRAINE AND 
GEORGIA WILL HAVE TO WAIT TOO 
GERMANY FRANCE AND OTHERS WARY OF 
UPSETTING RUSSIA SAID THE TIME WAS 
NOT RIGHT TO SET THEM ON THE ROAD 
TO MEMBERSHIP YET THE NATO 
SECRETARY GENERAL MADE CLEAR THAT 
THEIR MEMBERSHIP WAS ONLY A 
QUESTION OF TIME 
WE AGREED TODAY 
THAT THESE COUNTRIES WILL BECOME 
MEMBERS OF NATO BOTH NATIONS HAVE 
MADE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO 
ALLIANCE OPERATIONS WE WELCOME THE 
DEMOCRATIC REFORMS IN UKRAINE AND 
GEORGIA AND LOOK FORWARD TO FREE 
AND FAIR PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN 
GEORGIA IN MAY 
BUT IF PRESIDENT 
BUSH WAS DISAPPOINTED IN HIS HOPES 
FOR GEORGIA AND UKRAINE THE U. S. 
CAME AWAY WITH A MAJOR VICTORY ON 
CITING A MISSILE DEFENCE SHIELD IN 
EUROPE NATO HAD BEEN DIVIDED ON 
THE ISSUE THAT HAS NOW ACCEPTED THE 
NEED FOR MISSILE DEFENCE ON 
EUROPEAN SOIL EVEN THOUGH IT MAY 
ANGER MOSCOW YET ON THE MISSION 
THAT NATO HAS STAKED ITS REPUTATION 
ON AFGHANISTAN IT IS STILL NOT 
CLEAR IF ENOUGH HAS BEEN PLEDGED TO 
SATISFY COMMANDERS ON THE GROUND 
THE U. S. PRAISED FRANCE FOR ITS 
PROMISE OF UP TO EIGHT HUNDRED MORE TROOPS 
READY TO FIGHT IN AFGHANISTAN 
LIKELY TO BE SENT TO THE EAST 
FREEING U. S. TROOPS TO MOVE SOUTH 
ALONGSIDE CANADIAN FORCES BUT MANY 
AT BUCHAREST WERE KEEN TO EMPHASISE 
THE NEED FOR A MORE COMPREHENSIVE 
APPROACH WITH THE FOCUS MOVING 
FROM THE PURELY MILITARY TO CO 
ORDINATED CIVIL AND POLITICAL 
RECONSTRUCTION THE U. K. PUT FORWARD 
A TRUST FUND FOR AFGHANISTAN IN 
WHICH COUNTRIES UNABLE TO 
CONTRIBUTE TROOPS WOULD BE ABLE TO 
OFFER MONEY OR EQUIPMENT NATO ALSO 
WANTS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT 
AFGHANISTAN IS NOT JUST THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ALLIANCE BUT 
THE WIDER INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
WITH THE UN AND THE E. U. BOTH 
REPRESENTED AT TODAY'S MEETING IT 
WAS A SUMMIT WITH SOMETHING FOR 
EVERYONE EXCEPT MACEDONIA NATO 
HAS STRESSED THAT IT DOES WANT THE 
UKRAINE AND GEORGIA AS MEMBERS AND 
THEIR ENTRY IS SIMPLY A MATTER OF 
TIME IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW RUSSIA 
WILL REACT TO THAT OR TO THE 
MISSILE DEFENCE PLANS PRESIDENT 
VLADIMIR PUTIN IS DUE FOR 
DISCUSSIONS ON FRIDAY AND WILL HAVE 
A CHANCE TO TELL PRESIDENT BUSH 
EXACTLY WHAT HE THINKS WHEN THEY 
MEET FOR THE LAST TIME AS HEADS OF 
STATE ON SUNDAY 
A SUMMIT WITH SOMETHING FOR 
EVERYONE LET'S GO LIVE TO 
BUCHAREST AND JOIN OUR 
CORRESPONDENT THERE PAUL ADAMS 
OVER TO YOU 
THANK YOU SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE 
A COMPLICATED DAY OF DEVELOPMENTS 
ON A NUMBER OF FRANCE WE ARE 
JOINED TO DISCUSS SOME OF THEM BY 
BRITAIN'S FOREIGN SECRETARY DAVID 
MILIBAND LET'S START WITH 
AFGHANISTAN THE NATO SECRETARY 
GENERAL SPOKE ABOUT A CHANGE OF 
EMPHASIS A REBALANCING OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S EFFORT IN 
AFGHANISTAN IS THAT HOW YOU SEE 
IT 
I THINK IT HAS BEEN AN IT IMPORTANT DAY THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY IS RAISING ITS GAME AS 
ARE THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT YOU ARE 
SEEING NOT JUST MORE TROOP 
COMMITMENTS ALTHOUGH THAT WILL GET 
THE HEADLINES YOU ARE ALSO SEEING 
A RECOGNITION THAT THERE IS NOT A 
MILITARY VICTORY IN AFGHANISTAN 
THERE HAS TO BE A POLITICAL VICTORY 
FOR THAT MEANS GIVING HOPE TO THE 
PEOPLE THROUGH ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL 
DEVELOPMENT IT MEANS ENSURING WE 
MARGINALISE THOSE PARTS OF THE 
TALEBAN AFFILIATED WITH AL QAEDA 
AND IT MEANS ENSURING THAT THE 
MILITARY VICTORIES CARVE OUT 
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SPACE SO IT 
IS A REBALANCING A CHANGE OF GEAR 
BUT IT IS ALSO A RECOGNITION THAT 
WE ARE NOT CREATING A NEW COLONY IN 
AFGHANISTAN IT IS ABOUT SUPPORTING 
A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT 
WHICH HAS RESPONSIBILITIES TO 
CRACKDOWN ON CORRUPTION AND MAKE 
SURE 
IT WORKS IN A PROPER WAY BUT BUT IT TAKES PLACE AGAINST A BACKDROP 
OF COMMANDERS SAYING THEY NEED A 
LOT MORE TROOPS WE HEARD FROM 
FRANCE A COMMITMENT OF EIGHT HUNDRED EXTRA 
TROOPS WHICH HAS EASED THE 
SITUATION BUT CAPABILITY IS STILL 
A PROBLEM 
THE LARGEST NUMBER OF 
EXTRA TROOPS WILL BE AFGHANS THIS 
HAS TO BE AN AFGHAN LED APPROACH 
AT THE MOMENT THERE ARE ABOUT 
FORTY NINE THOUSAND AFGHANS IN THE AFGHAN 
NATIONAL ARMY UP FROM HARDING 
ANYTHING FIVE YEARS AGO THE TARGET 
FOR THAT IS EIGHTY THOUSAND FROM HARDLY 
ANYTHING FIVE YEARS AGO YOU WILL 
SEE A LARGE INCREASE IN AFGHAN 
CAPACITY AND THAT IS WHAT WE NEED 
OUR TROOPS THEREFORE TO PROTECT 
SPACE AND DO THE TRAINING TO ALLOW 
THE AFGHANS TO RUN THEIR OWN 
SOCIETY 
THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY COMMUNITY HAS ALSO BEEN ACCUSED OF 
A RATHER DISJOINTED ALMOST 
DYSFUNCTIONAL ROLE IN AFGHANISTAN 
WITH TOO MANY DIFFERENT PLAYERS 
TOO MANY DIFFERENT AGENDAS WE NOW 
HAVE IN THE FIGURE OF KAI EIDE AN 
INTERNATIONAL SUPREMO IF YOU LIKE 
ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT THINGS WILL 
BE MORE JOINED UP 
YES I HAVE JUST 
COME FROM A MEETING WITH PRESIDENT 
KARZAI WITH GORDON BROWN AND 
MYSELF TO TALK ABOUT HIS 
RESPONSIBILITIES BUT ALSO THE NEW 
INTERNATIONAL CO ORDINATOR KAI 
EIDE WHO HAS CONFIDENCE FROM THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND AFGHANS 
WE RECOGNISE THAT FROM FORTY SIX COUNTRIES 
THEY CANNOT ALL HAVE BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE AFGHAN 
GOVERNMENT IT HAS TO BE PROPERLY 
CO ORDINATED AND THERE HAS BEEN A 
LONG STANDING DEMAND FOR THE SORT 
OF SUPREMO THAT YOU DESCRIBE THE 
DIPLOMAT WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED 
WILL DO A GOOD JOB 
GEORGIA AND 
UKRAINE TOLD YES BUT NOT QUITE NOW 
THE GEORGIAN PRESIDENT SEEMS VERY 
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE OFFER THAT 
HAS BEEN MADE TO HIM CLEARLY SOME 
MEMBERS HERE HAD GRAVE RESERVATIONS 
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THESE TWO 
COUNTRIES WERE READY FOR MEMBERSHIP 
MEMBERSHIP IS NOT THE ISSUE TODAY 
NO ONE IS ARGUING THEY SHOULD 
BECOME MEMBERS TODAY WHAT WE HAVE 
SAID IS THAT THEY WILL BECOME 
MEMBERS A STRONG VOTE OF 
CONFIDENCE IN THE DEMOCRATIC AND 
WESTERN ORIENTED IMPULSE OF UKRAINE 
AND GEORGIA BUT THERE IS A 
SIGNIFICANT MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION 
PROCESS THAT EVERY COUNTRY HAS TO 
GO THROUGH WHICH TAKES MANY YEARS 
NOT MONTHS I THINK WHAT IS 
IMPORTANT ABOUT TODAY IS THAT THERE 
HAS BEEN A SIGNAL AND A 
DETERMINATION TO GET ON WITH THE 
PRACTICAL WORK THAT IS WHY IT 
STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN A 
CLEAR LONG TERM GOAL AND THE 
RECOGNITION THAT THERE IS A LOT OF 
WORK TO BE DONE TO GET THERE BUT 
YOU SEE A NATO WHICH COUNTRIES WANT 
TO JOIN WHICH SHOWS IT IS 
SUCCESSFUL BUT ALSO AN 
ORGANISATION WHICH UNDERSTANDS ITS 
FUNCTIONS ARE CHANGING WHICH IS 
REMARKABLY STRONG ORGANISATION 
TURNING FURTHER AFIELD IN ZIMBABWE 
NEWS TONIGHT SUGGESTING THAT THE 
RULING PARTY IS PREPARING TO FIGHT 
BACK TALK OF A SECOND ROUND OF 
ELECTIONS WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON 
WHAT IS GOING ON THERE 
I HAVE 
SPOKEN TO THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR IN 
HARARE TODAY IT IS A MOMENT OF 
OPPORTUNITY FOR ZIMBABWE BUT IT IS 
VITAL THAT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE 
IS HEARD WE DO NOT HAVE THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RESULTS FROM 
LAST SATURDAY YET THEY NEED TO BE 
OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND TO 
REFLECT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IF 
NO CANDIDATE HAS FIFTY PER CENT THERE NEEDS 
TO BE A RUN OFF BUT THAT NEEDS TO 
BE MUCH STRICTER IN ADHERING TO THE 
MOST BASIC PRINCIPLES OF FREE AND 
FAIR ELECTIONS SET NOT BY ME BUT 
BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT 
COMMUNITY I THINK INTERNATIONAL 
MONITORS WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT AND 
I HOPE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
DEMANDS IT AND THE ZIMBABWEAN 
AUTHORITIES ALLOW IT 
MANY THANKS 
THE SUMMIT IS NOT QUITE OVER 
PRESIDENT PUTIN OF RUSSIA HAS 
ARRIVED AND PERHAPS WILL GIVE US 
THE BENEFIT OF IT OF HIS VIEWS ON 
TODAY'S DEVELOPMENTS PARTICULARLY 
THE OFFER TO UKRAINE AND GEORGIA 
MORE ON THAT TOMORROW 
THAT WILL BE INTERESTING WATCHING 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH

WILD SALMON FISHING OFF THE PACIFIC 
COAST IN THE U. S. IS A MASSIVE 
INDUSTRY IMAGINE THE SENSE OF 
PANIC AT THE PROSPECT OF A FULL 
ONE YEAR BAN ON FISHING THAT IS 
THE DECISION THAT THE U. S. 
ADMINISTRATION IS CONSIDERING TO 
TRY TO REPLENISH RAPIDLY 
DIMINISHING STOCKS U. S. FISHERMEN 
ARE CLAIMING IT WILL DEVASTATE 
THEIR BUSINESSES 
IN SAN FRANCISCO HARBOUR THE SEA

CAREER INSTEAD OF THE BEGINNING 
WHEN THIS IS HAPPENING I KNOW A 
COUPLE OF THE YOUNG SKIPPERS IN 
THEIR LATE TWENTIES AND EARLY THIRTIES WITH 
FAMILIES AND HOUSE PAYMENTS I REL 
FEEL BAD FOR THEM 
WILD PACIFIC 
SALMON WILL COST TWICE WHAT IT DID 
THREE YEARS AGO THE BAN THIS 
SEASON WILL COST THE AMERICAN 
ECONOMY MILLIONS 
FOR ONCE IT IS NOT THE FISHERMEN 
GETTING THE BLAME FOR THE 
DISAPPEARANCE OF SALMON IT IS FOR 
A VARIETY OF REASONS SOME NATURAL 
SOME HOME MADE 
SAM ON ARE NOT MAKING IT UPSTRAEK 
THERE IS POLLUTION AND RIVER 
LEVELS ARE LOWER AS WATER IS 
DIVERTED TO HELP IN CROPS AND 
CITIES IN A TRIBUTARY OF THIS 
RIVER THE SCIENTISTS ARE 
NUMBERERING THE YOUNG SALMON 
SALMON START LIFE IN PLACES LIKE 
THIS BUT THE NUMBERS ARE AT BEST A 
QUARTER OF WHAT THEY SHOULD BE 
THESE NUMBERS PREDICT FURTHER GLOOM 
THE FISHERY SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN FOR 
AT LEAST TWO YEARS IT HAS ALREADY 
BEEN ON THE ROCKS 
WHAT WILL THAT MEAN FISHERMEN FISHERMEN LOSING THEIR JOBS 
THEY WILL FEEL IT HERE IN OREGON 
A SALMON TOWN WHERE THEY THINK 
THAT A BAN IS A QUICK FIX FOR A 
DEEPER PROBLEM 
WITH HAVE TO GO BACK TO CLEAN UP 
THE NATURAL RESOURCES AND GO FROM 
THERE THERE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS PEOPLE 
ALONG THIS PACIFIC SHORE HAVE 
DEPENDED ON SALMON MAPBS'S IMPACT 
ON THE SEAS AND THE RIVERS MEANS 
THAT THOSE DAYS COULD BE OVER
