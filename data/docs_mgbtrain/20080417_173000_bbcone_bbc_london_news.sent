QUEUE WITH THESE OTHER FOLK A A GROUP OF UNHAPPY PASSENGERS GIVE 
TERMINAL FIVE A RAP 
A LOOK AHEAD TO THE WEATHER ALL TO 
COME 
WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMME 
TRIBUTES HAVE BEEN PAID TO A 
PENSIONER WHO WAS KILLED BY A TRAIN 
AT A RAILWAY CROSSING THERESA 
MANSELL WAS OUT WALKING WITH A 
FRIEND WHEN SHE CAUGHT HER FOOT IN 
THE TRACKS AND WAS UNABLE TO FREE 
HERSELF AS THE TRAIN APPROACHED 
THIS LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER A 
COUPLE WERE STRUCK BY A TRAIN IN 
ESSEX ESSEX AYSHEA BUKSH REPORTS 
TRAINS BETWEEN LONDON WATERLOO AND 
WINDSOR TRAVEL THROUGH THIS LEAFY 
AREA OF STAINES ONE GOES BY ABOUT 
EVERY TWENTY OR SO MINUTES 
THERESA MANSELL HAD BEEN WALKING 
WITH HER GOOD FRIEND AS THEY HAD 
DONE MANY TIMES BEFORE THEY WALKED 
OVER THIS RAILWAY CROSSING BUT 
THERESA'S FOOT GOT STUCK BETWEEN 
THE METAL AND WOOD OF THE TRACK 
HER FRIEND TRIED TO PULL HER AWAY 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY SHE WAS TRAPPED 
THERESA MANSELL AND HER FAMILY HAVE 
LIVED IN THE AREA FOR MORE THAN THIRTY 
YEARS HER SON IAN SAID SHE WAS 
NO STRANGER TO THE CROSSING SHE SHE MUST HAVE CROSSED THIS CROSSING 
THOUSANDS OF TIMES SHE USED TO 
WALK HER DOG AT THE TIME OVER HERE 
US AS CHILDREN MY MOTHER IS A 
VETERAN OF CROSSING THIS RAILWAY 
THERESA WAS A RETIRED ART TEACH AND 
ALSO DID VOLUNTARY WORK WITH 
DISABLED CHILDREN AND ENJOYED 
WALKING IN THE NEARBY COUNTRYSIDE 
WHEN OUR CHILDREN WERE SMALL WE 
USED TO GO BACK BERRYING L. WAS 
MORE FRIGHTENED OF THE HORSES THAN 
THE TRAINS 
FRIEND AND LOCAL 
RESIDENT BRIAN SMITH HAS LONG 
FEARED SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD 
HAPPEN HE HAS WRITTEN SEVERAL 
TIMES TO NETWORK RAIL TO MAKE IT 
SAFER SAFER IN THE WINTER THIS GETS FROZEN 
SOLID AND IT'S LIKE SKATING RINK 
IT'S AS SLIPPERY AS ANYTHING 
ANYBODY CAN WALK ACROSS HERE SLIP 
BACK THEIR HEAD AND WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED YOU HAVE LOST ANOTHER 
PERSON 
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO PUT A PERSON FOOT BRIDGE IF IT WILL SAVE MORE 
LIVES THERE WAS PEOPLE KILLED 
RECENTLY IN LONDON WITH ALMOST THE 
SAME CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN IS THIS 
GOING TO CHANGE 
YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING 
TO HAVE TO DIE 
THE RAILWAY CROSSING IS NOW BACK IN 
USE AS FAMILY AND FRIENDS ON TO TO 
GRIEVE THE LOSS OF THERESA MANSELL 
A FULL INVESTIGATION BY NETWORK 
RAIL IS UNDER WAY 
PLENTY MORE TO COME THIS EVENING 
INCLUDING INCLUDING THE YOUNG OFFENDERS TEACHING 
PENSIONERS THE JOYS OF THE WEB 
THERE'S A WARNING THAT MANY SCHOOLS 
COULD FACE SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS 
IN THE AUTUMN BECAUSE OF A 
GOVERNMENT CRACKDOWN ON THE 
EMPLOYMENT OF OVERSEAS TRAINED 
STAFF ONE IN SIX OF LONDON'S 
TEACHERS COULD BE AFFECTED BECAUSE 
THEY DON'T HAVE QUALIFIED TEACHERS 
STATUS MORE FROM OUR SPECIAL KURT 
BARLING BARLING HISTORICALLY THE CAPITAL HAS HAD 
DIFFICULTIES WITH RECRUITMENT AND 
RETENTION OF QUALIFIED TEACHING 
STAFF AT BOTH PRAIMARY AND 
SECONDARY LEVEL QUALIFIED TEACHERS 
FROM ACROSS THE COMMONWEALTH AND 
NOW THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE MET THE 
GAP NOW IT'S FEARED THAT THOSE 
WITHOUT QUALIFIED TEACHERS STATUS 
WILL HAVE TO STOP TEACHING BY 
SEPTEMBER SEPTEMBER WE HAVE ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND TEACHERS IN 
THE CAPITAL WHO THIS MIGHT AFFECT 
SOME OF THEM HAVEN'T BEEN TEACHING 
ANYWHERE NEAR FOUR YEARS AND THAT 
IS FINE THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT 
THEY NEED TO GET THIS QUALIFICATION 
UNDER THEIR BELT 
BUT IT IS WORRY IF THERE ARE 
PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN TEACHING HERE 
FOR UP TO OR MORE THAN FOUR YEARS 
WHO ARE GOING TO NOT BE ABLE TO 
TEACH IN SEPTEMBER 
THE QTS QUALIFICATION IS AN 
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT FOR ALL 
OVERSEAS TEACHERS IT CAN BE DONE 
WITHIN FEW TERMS BUT STRIKES SOME 
RECRUITS AS RATHER ONEROUS I'M I'M QUALIFIED TO TEACH YOUR CHILDREN 
FOR FOUR YEARS THEN YOU SAY I'M 
NOT YOU CAN'T TEACH HERE ANY MORE 
I'M THINKING I COULD TEACH YOUR 
CHILDREN FOR FOUR YEARS AND IT WAS 
FINE WHY CAN'T I NOW L. DON'T 
THINK IT'S FAIR AT ALL 
FEW DISPUTE 
THE NEED FOR A COMMON STANDARD TO 
JUDGE THE COMPETENCIES OF TEACHING 
STAFF SOME BELIEVE WE ARE STILL 
NOT GETTING THE BALANCE RIGHT 
WE NEED TO FIND WAYS OF HELPING 
THESE PEOPLE WORK IN OUR SCHOOLS 
IF WE DENIED GOOD TEACHERS THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO WORK HAD THE U. K. AND 
IN LONDON IN PARTICULAR THEN WE 
ARE DENYING OUR CHILDREN PROPER EDUCATION 
THE NATIONAL UNION OF EDUCATION TEACHERS SAY IT WOULD BE A GREAT 
PITY IF EXPERIENCED TEACHERS WHO 
ARE WELL QUALIFIED ARE NO LONGER 
ABLE TO TEACH IN LONDON'S SCHOOLS 
THEY BELIEVE IT THERE SHOULD BE A 
GREATER ACCOMMODATION TO ENSURE 
THAT OVER SEAS QUALIFIED TEACHERS 
CAN TEACH OUR CHILDREN 
THAMES WATER HAS HAD A FINE REDUCED 
BY ALMOST THREE MILLION BECAUSE ITS 
PROCESSES WERE SO BAD THE FIRM 
DIDN'T REALISE IT HAD BROKEN ANY 
RULES THE INDUSTRY WATCHDOG OFWAT 
HAS TAKEN ACTION OVER MISREPORTING 
INFORMATION AND DELIVERING POOR 
SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS THE COMPANY 
SAYS THE FAILURES WERE 
UNINTENTIONAL AND STILL HAVE TO PAY 
A FINE OF NEARLY TEN MILLION THE 
SO CALLED BUS STOP KILLER WHO WAS 
GIVEN A LIFE SENTENCE FOR MURDERING 
TWO WOMEN IS TO APPEAL LEVI 
BELLFIELD WAS FOUND GUILTY OF 
KILLING AMELIE DELAGRANGE AND 
MARSHA MCDONNELL AFTER THEY GOT OFF 
BUSES IN SOUTH WEST LONDON 
THE FAR RIGHT BRITISH NATIONAL 
PARTY HAS BEEN CALM PAPPING TODAY 
IN CENTRAL LONDON AMID PREDICTIONS 
IT'S HEADING FOR ITS BIGGEST 
ELECTORAL SUCCESS EVER SOME 
EXPERTS SAY THE PARTY COULD BE 
ABOUT TO TAKE AT LEAST ONE SEAT ON 
THE LONDON ASSEMBLY KARL MERCER IS 
AT CITY HALL CARL WHAT HAVE YOU 
BEEN HEARING ABOUT THEIR PROSPECTS 
HERE'S WHAT I'M HEARING THE PEOPLE 
HERE AT CITY HALL ARE TAKING THE 
POSSIBILITY OF B. N. P. MEMBER BEING 
ELECTED ON MAY FIRST VERY SERIOUSLY S. 
SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE LABOUR PARTY 
AND THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY HAVE 
ALREADY MET WHAT THEY'VE DISCUSSED 
IS HOW THEIR GROUPS WILL DEAL WITH 
THE FACT THAT A B. N. P. MEMBER COULD BE 
SITTING HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY 
CHAMBER AFTER 
FIRST 
HE'S DELIVERING A DIFFERENT MESSAGE 
THESE DAYS ONCE UPON A TIME 
MATTHEW COLLINS WAS A MEMBER OF THE 
BRITISH NATIONAL PARTY TODAY HE 
IS ONE OF THOSE CAMPAIGNING AGAINST 
THEM MUCH OF HIS TIME UNTIL MAY 
FIRST IS SPENT DOING THIS BECAUSE 
NOW POLITICS WATCHERS SAY THE B. N. P. 
HAS A REALISTIC CHANCE OF WINNING A 
SEAT ON THE LONDON ASSEMBLY 
IN THE 
DARK DIM PAST I ACTUALLY WAS A B. N. P. 
ACTIVIST WHICH IS WHAT DRIVES ME 
NOW I RECOGNISED FOR A LONG TIME 
THERE WAS TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES AND 
PROBLEMS LIVING AND WORKING IN 
LONDON BUT TO MEET THE CHALLENGES 
AND MEET THE PROBLEMS YOU CAN'T USE 
RACISM TO ATTACK MEMBERS OF THE 
COMMUNITY SO I'M OUT ON THE OTHER 
SIDE NOW I'M OUT ON THE SIDE OF 
HOPE NOT HATE 
THE B. N. P. HAS MADE 
BIG STRIDES IN LONDON IN RECENT 
YEARS IN TWO THOUSAND SIX IT WON TWELVE SEATS ON 
BARKING AND DAGENHAM COUNCIL AT 
THE LAST CITY WIDE ELECTIONS CAME 
CLOSE TO WINNING A SEAT ON THE 
LONDON ASESMIBLY LAST MONTH HERE 
IN HAVERING THERE WAS A BY 
ELECTION THE B. N. P. HAD A SEAT AND 
THEY DEFENDED IT THIS TIME A 
THIRD OF THE PEOPLE VOTED FOR THEM 
THIS PART OF HAVERING IS HOME TO 
THE TRADITIONAL WHITE WORKING CLASS 
VOTE IT HASN'T SEEN IMMIGRATION ON 
THE LEVELS OF OTHER PARTS OF LONDON 
BUT THE B. N. P.'S MESSAGE ON LAW AND 
ORDER AN ON HOUSING AND RACE HAS 
CHIMED WITH SOME LOCALS OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS OF THE B. N. P. IS 
SORT OF LIKE JUST MAINLY 
UNFORTUNATELY ONE SIDED AS A 
TRADER HERE I FIND THAT THEY ARE 
THE ONLY ONES THAT SEEM TO BE 
SPEAKING UP FOR US 
THEY START 
SPOUTING OFF CONSERVATIVES LABOUR 
LIBERAL YOU NAME T. THE ONES THAT 
PEOPLE WANT IN DON'T GET VOTED IN 
A FIVE PER CENT VOTE WOULD SEE B. N. P. CANDIDATE 
SITTING IN THE LONDON ASSEMBLY NOT 
OUT OF THE QUESTION ACCORDING TO 
POLITICAL NUMBER CRUNCHERS FOUR FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN THE ELECTIONS WERE 
HELD ON THE SAME DAY AS EUROPEAN 
ELECTIONS WHEN A LOT OF 
CONCENTRATION WAS ON THE UKIP PARTY 
EVEN THEN WITH ALL OF THE PUBLICITY 
ELSE WHERE THEY CAME WITHIN A 
WHISKER OF GETTING THE KEY FIVE PER CENT OF 
THE VOTE 
A SIGN OF THE CONFIDENCE 
TODAY PERHAPS CAMPAIGNING IN 
UNFAMILIAR TURF OUTSIDE THE HIGH 
COURT IN LONDON LAW AND ORDER A 
CENTRAL THEME FINGERS POINTED AT 
THE BIGGER PARTIES 
THREE MAIN 
CANDIDATES ARE PANDERING TOWARDS 
ONE PART OF THE COMMUNITY TO GRAB 
THOSE VOTES OR THE FACT THEY ARE 
RECOGNISING THEY WON'T GET THE 
WHITE WORKING CLASS VOTE 
WHAT DO 
YOU MEAN 
THE ETHNIC PART OF THE 
COMMUNITY THEY'RE PANDERING 
TOWARDS THE MUSLIMS TOWARDS THIS 
FRACTION 
THE CHALLENGE FOR THOSE FRACTION FIGHTING THE B. N. P. IS TO TRY AND 
RAIDS TURNOUT THE B. N. P. ITSELF 
REMAINS CONFIDENT OF PICKING UP ONE 
ASSEMBLY SEAT 
IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE B. N. P. ALL 
THREE MAIN CANDIDATES FOR MAYOR 
HAVE MADE STRENUOUS ATTEMPTS TO 
COURT THE VOTE OF MANY OF LONDON'S 
MINORITIES AS TIM DONEO VAN 
REPORTS IT'S A STRATEGY THAT ALSO 
HAS RISKS 
KEN LIVINGSTONE OUT IN SOHO AND A 
SHOW OF SUPPORT FROM GAY GROUPS FOR 
THE MAN WHO INTRODUCED CIVIL 
PARTNERSHIPS TO LONDON IT WAS THE 
SAME MAN WHO LININGED A JEWISH 
REPORT TORE A CONCENTRATION CAMP 
GUARD AND REFUSED TO APOLOGISE HE 
REFUSED TO SAY HE WAS WRONG TO 
INVITE SHEIKH AL KHARADADI WHOSE 
VIEWS ON GAY PEOPLE AND OTHERS MAY 
FIND SO ABHORRENT 
YOU WON'T FIND 
THE RABBI CALLING 
WHEN HE CAME 
TO LONDON AND I HEARD HIM SPEAK AND 
LATER WHEN HE WAS ON NEWSNIGHT 
BEING QERBGSD HE SAID YOU MUST NOT 
ATTACK HOMO SEXUALS YOU MUST NOT 
STRIKE YOUR WIFE YOU MUST OBEY AND 
RESPECT THE LAWS OF YOUR LAND L. 
BELIEVE WE SHOULD ENGAGE WITH ANY 
MUSLIM OPINION THAT IS OPPOSED TO 
AL QAEDA 
HE HAS SAID SORRY FOR ANY AL QAEDA OFFENCE CAUSED BY USING THE WORD 
PIKININIS IN AN ARTICLE SEVERAL 
YEARS AGO 
I REPEATEDLY SAID THAT I 
APOLOGISED FOR THE OFFENCE I CAUSED 
PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR OUR POLICIES 
FOR UNITING LONDON RATHER THAN 
HARPING ON BITS AND PIECES FROM 
ARTICLES THAT YOU CAN CULL FROM 
MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS OF WRITING TO 
DEMONSTRATE SOMETHING THAT IS 
SIMPLY NOT IN MY HEART AS AS BRITAIN'S MOST SENIOR GAY POLICE 
OFFICER BRINE PADDICK HAS BEEN 
HAPPY FOR HIS SEXUALITY TO BE AN 
OPEN AND PROMINENT PART OF HIS 
PROFILE BUT HE ACCEPTS SOME VOTERS 
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT HIM 
BECAUSE OF IT 
I LIKE EVERYBODY 
IS A SINNER THERE ARE ASPECTS OF 
MY LIFE WHICH DO NOT MEET THE HIGH 
STANDARDS THAT PEOPLE FEEL WE 
SHOULD TRY TO LIVE UP TO WHEN 
PEOPLE REALISE I'M A DECENT MAN MY 
SEXUALITY BECOMES A SECONDARY 
AFFAIR 
THE LEE JASPER AFFAIR WAS AFFAIR DANGEROUS FOR KEN LIVINGSTONE ALL 
OF THE CANDIDATES KNOW THEY NEED TO 
SHOW THEY WOULD UNITE NOT DIVIDE 
LONDONERS LONDONERS AS WE'VE BEEN HEALTH AND SAFETY 
EXECUTIVE THE U. K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY 
LAUNCHED ITS LONDON MAYORAL 
CAMPAIGN AMONG ITS POLICIES IS THE 
ABOLITION OF THE CONGESTION CHARGE 
GETTING RID OF SPEED BUMPS AND 
REPHASING TRAFFIC LIGHTS IN FAVOUR

JOINING US NOW IS THE UKIP 
CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR GERARD WANT 
EVERYONE HAS A POLICY ON THE 
CONGESTION CHARGE YOURS IS TO GET

PROPER NOTE OF ROADS OF ROAD 
TRAFFIC OF TAXIS OF TUBES AND OF 
ALL KINDS OF TRANSPORT WHAT I 
THINK THE CONGESTION CHARGE IS A 
CON IT'S BASICALLY A WAIVE GETTING 
MONEY OUT OF THE TAXPAYER ANOTHER 
WAY OF GETTING MONEY OUT OF THE 
TAXPAYER IF WE AREER WHAT KEN SAID 
IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE HE SAID I HATE CARS IF I 
GET ELECTED AGAIN I WILL BAN THEM 
ALL 
ARE YOU ON THE SIDE OF THE ALL MOTORIST 
YES THAT IS NOT TO SAY MOTORIST WE WILL DO THAT AT THE EXPENSE OF 
EVERYBODY ELSE AS A TRANSPORT 
SYSTEM IN LONDON WE WANT TO 
RECOGNISE THAT EVERYTHING HAS A 
PART TO PLAY AND TO STOP 
PERSECUTING THE MOTORIST BUT BUT REPHASING TRAFFIC LIGHTS DOESN'T 
SOUND LIKE YOU ARE ON THE SIDE THE 
PEDESTRIAN 
YOU SAID IN FAVOUR OF PEDESTRIAN THE MOTORIST I DON'T WANT IT TO BE 
AGAINST ANYONE IN PARTICULAR SO 
EVERYONE GETS A CHANCE DO DRIVE AND 
CROSS THE ROAD 
ALL THINGS TO ALL 
MEN 
TO MAKE IT AS FAIR AS POSSIBLE MEN IS THIS WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS A 
SYSTEM THAT IS WEIGHTED AGAINST 
TRAFFIC KEN WANTS TO DRIVE PEOPLE

THE TUBE LATE STPHRI I USE THE TUBE

IT'S MORE 
OF A NIGHTMARE EVERY DAY YOU NEED 
PROPER TUBES AND BUS SERVICES THAT

HAVE TO TAKE TOTAL VIEW GERARD GERARD BATTEN YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT 
IMMIGRATION LEVELS IN LONDON BUTT 
MAYOR HAS NO POWERS OVER THAT 
THAT'S PERFECTLY TRUE BUT THERE 
ARE THINGS THAT THE MAYORS CAN DO 
AND THINGS THE MAYOR WOULD LIKE TO 
DO IF YOU VOTE FOR A MAYOR YOU 
GIVE HIM A PLATFORM TO TALK ABOUT 
THINGS IMMIGRATION IS KEY THING 
IT DOES AFFECT LONDON GREATLY 
BECAUSE SEVENTY PER CENT OF IMMIGRANTS COME TO 
LONDON SO IF YOU ELECT ME MAYOR I 
CAN HAVE A PUBLIC PLATFORM TO SAY 
MASS IMMIGRATION SHOULD NOW STOP

THE IMMIGRANTS WE HAVE AND 
INTRODUCE A STRICT POINTS BASED 
SYSTEM FOR IMMIGRANTS GERARD GERARD BATTEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
