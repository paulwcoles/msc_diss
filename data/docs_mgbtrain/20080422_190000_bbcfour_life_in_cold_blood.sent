ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION YEARS AGO 
A BRAND NEW FAMILY OF ANIMALS WAS EVOLVING IN THE PRIMEVAL SWAMPS 
THEY WERE TO GO ONE STEP FURTHER THAN THE AMPHIBIANS 
WHO HAD EMERGED ONTO DRY LAND BEFORE THEM 
FOR THEY WOULD EVENTUALLY COMPLETELY CUT THEIR TIES WITH WATER 
THEY WERE THE ANCESTORS OF TODAY'S LIZARDS 
THEY EVOLVED SCALY IMPERMEABLE SKINS AND MOVED UP INTO THE FORESTS 
THEY DIVERSIFIED INTO A MULTITUDE OF DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES 
AND THEY SQUABBLED AS ANIMALS DO OVER MATES AND TERRITORY 
FOR FOOD THEY HUNTED INSECTS 
THAT WERE ALREADY WELL ESTABLISHED ON THE LAND IN GREAT NUMBERS 
AND HERE WITHOUT RETURNING TO WATER THEY PRODUCED THEIR FAMILIES 
THEY POWERED THEIR BODIES NOT ONLY WITH FOOD 
BUT WITH THE HEAT THAT THEY DREW DIRECTLY FROM THE SUN 
AS THEY DIVERSIFIED 
SO THEY SPREAD INTO THE HARSHEST OF THE LAND'S HABITATS 
THE BAKING WATERLESS DESERTS 
WHICH EVENTUALLY THEY WOULD COME TO DOMINATE 
THE BIGGER ONES ARE TRULY POWERFUL AND FIERCE 
REARING UP THEY'RE WELL ABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES 
WITH THEIR FRONT LEGS IF THEY'RE THREATENED 
THIS IS A VERY INTELLIGENT ANIMAL 
IT IS OBSERVING ME JUST AS I AM OBSERVING IT 
IT'S A MONITOR LIZARD 
AND IT'S KING OF THIS COUNTRY THE AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK 
IT IS FRIGHTENED OF PRETTY WELL NOTHING OBVIOUSLY INCLUDING ME 
AND IT WILL CHASE AND HUNT AND EAT PRETTY WELL ANYTHING 
THERE ARE SEVERAL THOUSAND LIZARDS ROUND THE WORLD 
AND THEY ARE TRULY THE DRAGONS OF THE DRY 
THEIR EGGS ON LAND HAD TO BE ENCASED IN SHELLS 
TO PREVENT THEM FROM DRYING OUT 
AND WHAT BETTER PLACE TO LAY THEM COULD A MOTHER LIZARD FIND 
THAN A TERMITE'S NEST 
WORKER TERMITES LABOUR UNCEASINGLY TO KEEP THE TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY 
VIRTUALLY CONSTANT FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT 
BUT THAT ALSO MAKES THEIR MOUND A NEAR PERFECT INCUBATOR FOR EGGS OF OTHERS 
AFTER TEN MONTHS THEY'RE BEGINNING TO HATCH 
THESE ARE BABY LACE MONITORS 
BUT THEY FACE A MAJOR PROBLEM 
A TERMITE NEST'S WALLS CAN BE A FOOT THICK AND EXTREMELY HARD 
TOO HARD FOR THE YOUNG MONITORS TO BREAK THROUGH 
THEY ARE IMPRISONED WITH NO FOOD 
FOR A WEEK AFTER HATCHING THEY ARE SUSTAINED BY THE LAST OF THE YOLK 
THAT REMAINS IN THEIR STOMACHS 
BUT WHEN THAT COMES TO AN END THEY COULD STARVE 
AN ADULT LACE MONITOR IS NEARBY 
IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE BABY'S MOTHER 
IF NOT THEN IT COULD BE A THREAT FOR MONITORS ARE HUNTERS 
AND WILL EAT MOST SMALL ANIMALS INCLUDING BABY LIZARDS 
SHE'S NEARING THE TERMITE NEST WITHIN WHICH THE YOUNG ARE TRAPPED 
SHE COULD BE LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO LAY HER EGGS 
ALTERNATIVELY SHE MIGHT BE SEARCHING FOR FOOD SUCH AS LITTLE LIZARDS 
THE BABIES ARE RELEASED UNHARMED 
PERHAPS SHE IS INDEED THE BABIES' MOTHER 
AND NOT ONLY REMEMBERED EXACTLY WHERE SHE LAID HER EGGS A YEAR AGO 
BUT KNEW THAT HER BABIES WOULD NEED HER HELP TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR INCUBATOR 
THE YOUNG HOWEVER ARE FREE 
BUT THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS PLACE 
THEY HEAD FOR SAFETY UP INTO THE TREES 
IN THE BRANCHES THERE ARE OTHER KINDS OF LIZARDS 
JACKY DRAGONS 
EACH HAS ITS OWN TERRITORY AND WARNS OTHERS TO KEEP OUT 
A WAVE OF THE FRONT LEG AND A BOB OF THE HEAD 
IS A JACKY DRAGON'S WAY OF CLAIMING TERRITORY 
HERE THE ACTION IS SLOWED DOWN 
IN REALITY THE LEG FLICK IS SO SWIFT 
IT'S HARD FOR US TO SEE BUT IT'S VERY PLAIN TO ANOTHER JACKY DRAGON 
BUT SOMETIMES SIGNALS ARE NOT ENOUGH 
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE IS NEEDED 
HE'S WON THE VANQUISHED ACKNOWLEDGES HIS DEFEAT 
WITH A DIFFERENT SIGNAL A SLOW LEG WAVE WITH NO HEAD BOB 
THE WINNER RETURNS TO HIS TERRITORY IN THE BRANCHES AND ANNOUNCES HIS VICTORY 
WHICH HIS NEIGHBOUR ACKNOWLEDGES 
SO NOW BOTH CAN LIVE ALONGSIDE ONE ANOTHER IN PEACE 
ONCE JACKY DRAGONS STOP SIGNALLING 
IT'S QUITE HARD TO SPOT THEM UP IN THE BRANCHES 
AMERICAN ANOLES ARE SO WELL CAMOUFLAGED THAT THEY ARE VIRTUALLY INVISIBLE 
THERE IS ONE ON THIS TREE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME 
BUT HE TOO NEEDS TO DRAW ATTENTION TO HIMSELF TO WARN OFF RIVALS 
AND THEN TO DISAPPEAR FROM PREDATORS 
THIS MIRROR MAY PERSUADE HIM TO REVEAL HIS SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM 
NOW THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT 
WHO'S THAT 
YES IT'S A RIVAL 
A TAIL WAG 
YES 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET RID OF ME THAT WAY 
SHOW US YOUR SIGNALS 
WELL PRESS UP CERTAINLY IS A KEEP AWAY CHALLENGE 
AND THERE THAT'S IT 
THE FULL WORKS 
AH LOVELY 
ONCE MORE 
THANK YOU AND AGAIN 
HE OBVIOUSLY THINKS THAT HIS POSITION IS BEING CONTESTED 
AND HE IS DISPLAYING TO SHOW THAT HE IS AS GOOD AS ANYONE ELSE 
SO I GUESS I'LL LEAVE HIM IN PEACE 
AN ANOLE'S THROAT FLAP APPEARS FOR ONLY A SECOND OR SO 
AND THEN VANISHES 
AND ITS OWNER AFTER SENDING HIS MESSAGE 
RETURNS TO CAMOUFLAGED OBSCURITY 
ANOTHER FAMILY OF LIZARDS LIVING IN THE TREE TOPS 
HAS AN EVEN MORE VARIED REPERTOIRE OF SIGNALS 
THEY USE NOT ONLY GESTURES BUT BODY COLOURS 
THEY'RE CHAMELEONS 
THEIR STRONGHOLD IS THE ISLAND OF MADAGASCAR 
HERE THERE ARE OVER SIXTY DIFFERENT SPECIES OF THEM 
ALMOST MORE THAN IN THE REST OF THE WORLD PUT TOGETHER 
THIS IS A PANTHER CHAMELEON 
AND IT'S MARVELLOUSLY ADAPTED 
FOR LIFE AMONG THE BRANCHES 
ITS TOES ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO BUNDLES THREE AND TWO 
AND THAT MEANS THAT IT CAN USE THEM JUST LIKE FORCEPS 
THEIR GRASPING FEET SUPPLEMENTED BY THEIR GRIPPING TAIL 
ENABLE THEM TO BECOME REMARKABLE SLOW MOTION ACROBATS 
I SUPPOSE CHAMELEONS ARE BEST KNOWN FOR THEIR ABILITY TO CHANGE COLOUR 
AND THAT DOES HELP IN CAMOUFLAGE 
BUT ACTUALLY THEY ALSO USE COLOUR CHANGE 
AS A WAY OF COMMUNICATION AND EXPRESSING THEIR EMOTIONS 
WHEN A MALE PANTHER CHAMELEON SPOTS A RIVAL 
HE EXPRESSES HIS FURY IN GLORIOUS TECHNICOLOUR 
MALAWI IN CENTRAL AFRICA MAY NOT HAVE AS MANY SPECIES 
OF CHAMELEON AS MADAGASCAR BUT IT HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST 
MELLER'S CHAMELEON 
THAT CAN BE SIXTY CENTIMETRES NEARLY TWO FEET FROM NOSE TO TAIL 
RIVAL MALES WHEN THEY DO BATTLE 
DEPLOY A RANGE OF THREATS THAT IS TRULY FORMIDABLE 
IF SIGNALS DON'T DETER THEN THEY START TO JOUST 
IT'S NOT ONLY MALES THAT FIGHT 
THERE ARE ALSO BATTLES BETWEEN THE SEXES 
THIS IS THE SOUTH AFRICAN DWARF CHAMELEON A MALE IN FULL COURTSHIP COSTUME 
THIS SOMEWHAT LESS COLOURFUL IS A FEMALE 
SHE IS NOT WELCOMING HIS ADVANCES 
AS HER MOOD DARKENS SO DOES HER SKIN 
SHE'S DRIVEN HIM AWAY BUT WHY 
THERE IS A REASON 
SHE'S PREGNANT 
HER HOME THE SOUTH AFRICAN CAPE CAN GET QUITE COLD 
SO INSTEAD OF LAYING HER EGGS ON THE GROUND AS MOST CHAMELEONS DO 
SHE RETAINS THEM WITHIN HER BODY 
AND WARMS THEM BY SEEKING OUT THE SUNNIEST PLACES AND SUNBATHING 
NOW THEY'RE READY TO EMERGE ALIVE 
PRODUCING BABIES IN THE BRANCHES MIGHT SEEM TO BE A RISKY BUSINESS 
BUT THE MEMBRANE ENCLOSING EACH ONE WILL STICK TO A TWIG 
IF IT HITS ONE 
AND WHEN AT LAST THE BABIES DISENTANGLE THEMSELVES 
THEY IMMEDIATELY DEPLOY THEIR FORMIDABLE CHAMELEON GRIP 
BY THE TIME THEY ARE PROPERLY DRIED OUT 
THE BABIES ARE AS MUCH AT HOME IN THE BRANCHES AS THEIR MOTHER 
BUT FOR THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CHAMELEONS OF ALL 
YOU HAVE TO LOOK NOT UP IN THE TREES 
BUT DOWN HERE ON THE LEAF LITTER 
A WHOLE RANGE OF SPECIES LIVE ON THE GROUND 
MANY OF WHICH HAVE ONLY RECENTLY BEEN DISCOVERED 
THIS IS SURELY THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY OF ALL CHAMELEONS 
IT'S THE PYGMY LEAF CHAMELEON 
THIS IS A MALE AND HE IS FULLY GROWN BELIEVE IT OR NOT 
AND YET WITHIN THIS TINY LITTLE BODY 
THERE ARE ALL THE ANATOMICAL DETAILS OF A NORMAL SIZED CHAMELEON 
WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY CREATURE 
LIKE ALL CHAMELEONS IT CATCHES ITS FOOD WITH ITS TONGUE 
IT EATS TINY FLIES 
GRASSHOPPERS ARE POPULAR WITH NORMAL SIZED CHAMELEONS 
THE TONGUE CONTAINS A TAPERED ROD ENCIRCLED BY MUSCLE 
AS THE MUSCLE CONTRACTS THE TONGUE SHOOTS FORWARD OFF THE ROD 
THE TIP PHYSICALLY GRASPS THE PREY 
AND THEN LONGITUDINAL MUSCLES CONTRACT TO PULL THE TONGUE 
BACK ONTO ITS ROD BRINGING THE PREY WITH IT 
WHICH MAY WEIGH HALF AS MUCH AS THE CHAMELEON ITSELF 
THE WHOLE ACTION IN REALITY IS COMPLETED IN A SECOND OR SO 
THE CANOPY OF A TROPICAL FOREST IS FULL OF FOOD 
AND LIZARDS CLAMBER AROUND LOOKING FOR IT IN MANY WAYS 
CHAMELEONS USE THEIR TOES TO GRIP THE TWIGS 
AND GECKOS USE THEIRS TO STICK TO LEAVES 
FOR THEIR TOES HAVE ADHESIVE PADS ON THE ENDS 
MOST GECKOS FEED ON INSECTS BUT SOME TAKE NECTAR FROM FLOWERS 
AND A FEW COLLECT LIQUID FROM INSECTS IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS WE TAKE MILK FROM COWS 
THE INSECT A TREEHOPPER IS SITTING HEAD DOWN DRINKING SAP FROM THE TREE 
IT WOULD BE INVISIBLE WERE IT NOT VIBRATING ITS ABDOMEN 
AND THAT IS WHAT THE GECKO WANTS FROM IT A DROP OF HONEYDEW 
HONEYDEW IS WHAT REMAINS OF TREE SAP AFTER THE HOPPER HAS EXTRACTED THE PROTEIN FROM IT 
IT'S VERY SWEET AND THE GECKO PLAINLY LOVES IT 
OTHER LESS COLOURFUL SPECIES OF GECKO ALSO DRINK HONEYDEW 
AND SOME ORDER IT FROM THE HOPPER BY VIBRATING THEIR HEADS 
THE HOPPER TELLS THE GECKO THAT A DRINK IS ON THE WAY 
BY WAGGLING ITS ABDOMEN 
HOW THE HOPPER BENEFITS FROM THIS ARRANGEMENT IS NOT CLEAR 
PERHAPS THE GECKO KEEPS PREDATORY INSECTS AWAY 
AND THE HONEYDEW IS PROTECTION MONEY 
MOST GECKOS ARE MUCH LESS CONSPICUOUS 
AND ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE 
IT'S THE MADAGASCAN LEAF TAILED GECKO 
AND ITS TAIL HAS WIDE FLANGES ON EITHER SIDE 
SO THAT IT HAS BECOME LEAF SHAPED 
BUT THESE AREN'T THE ONLY FLANGES 
IT HAS ALSO GOT THEM ALL ROUND ITS TOES ITS LEGS AND DOWN ITS FLANK 
AND THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT IF IT PRESSES ITSELF CLOSE TO THE BARK 
AND SPREADS THOSE FRILLS IT SHEDS NO SHADOW AT ALL 
THE IRISES OF ITS EYE ARE ALSO PART OF THIS AMAZING CAMOUFLAGE 
THEY HAVE A KIND OF MOTTLED PALE SURFACE WHICH MAKES THEM LOOK 
EXACTLY LIKE ONE OF THESE LITTLE BLOTCHES OF LICHEN ON THE BARK 
ALL IN ALL IT'S A MOST EXTRAORDINARY DISGUISE 
IT AND INDEED THE MAJORITY OF GECKOS 
ONLY REALLY BECOME ACTIVE AT NIGHT 
HERE IN BANGKOK AS IN CITIES THROUGHOUT THE TROPICS 
GECKOS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT MANKIND'S LIGHTS ATTRACT A GREAT BANQUET OF INSECTS 
AS A RESULT ALMOST EVERY BUILDING HAS ITS OWN RESIDENT GECKO POPULATION 
LIZARDS FOR THE MOST PART ARE NOT KNOWN FOR BEING CARING PARENTS 
BUT THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS 
IT'S SPRING IN THE WOODLANDS OF NORTH AMERICA 
AN AMERICAN ROBIN IS NESTING 
WARMING HER EGGS WITH THE HEAT GENERATED BY HER OWN BODY 
AND BELOW ON THE FOREST FLOOR A FIVE LINED SKINK 
IS WARMING HER COLD BLOODED BODY BY BASKING IN THE SUNSHINE 
SO THAT SHE CAN DO THE SAME THING 
SHE HAS A NEST BELOW THE LOG 
IT CAN GET QUITE CHILLY IN THESE WOODLANDS AND SHE WARMS HER EGGS 
BY TRANSFERRING TO THEM THE HEAT THAT SHE'S COLLECTED FROM THE SUN 
SHE TAKES JUST AS MUCH CARE OF HER EGGS AS THE ROBIN DOES 
A MONTH LATER AND HER EGGS ARE HATCHING 
THE ROBIN'S EGGS HAVE HATCHED TOO 
HER NESTLINGS ARE HELPLESS AND NEED CONSTANT FEEDING 
THE YOUNG SKINKS HOWEVER ARE ALREADY CAPABLE OF FINDING FOOD FOR THEMSELVES 
WITHIN A DAY OR SO THEY'VE LEFT THEIR MOTHER 
AND ARE INDEPENDENTLY EXPLORING THE WOODLAND FLOOR FOR THEMSELVES 
BUT THERE ARE OTHER SKINKS WHOSE FAMILY LIFE LASTS RATHER LONGER 
THESE FIELDS IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA ARE HOME TO A LITTLE LIZARD 
THAT IS SO RARE THAT IT HAD BEEN THOUGHT TO BE EXTINCT FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS 
UNTIL IT WAS REDISCOVERED IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO 
AND THE EQUIPMENT YOU NEED TO FIND IT IS 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT A FISHING ROD 
NOW LET'S SEE IF I CAN TEMPT HIM OUT WITH THIS 
OH GOSH 
NOW COME UP A LITTLE FARTHER SO WE CAN SEE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE 
THAT IS A VERY RARE LITTLE CREATURE 
IT'S A PYGMY BLUE TONGUED SKINK 
AND IT LIVES IN THE HOLES THAT ARE MADE BY TRAP DOOR SPIDERS 
AND THIS ONE'S CLEARLY VERY HUNGRY 
COME ON WON'T YOU COME OUT A LITTLE MORE COME ON 
JUST FOR US OH HA HA 
IT WON 
LET'S HAVE A CLOSER LOOK 
I CAN DO THAT WITH THIS OPTICAL PROBE 
WITH THIS VIEWING SCREEN ON THE END 
HE'S QUITE A LONG WAY DOWN 
THERE HE IS 
ALL SAFE AND SNUG 
AND HE REALLY IS SAFE DOWN HERE 
EVEN A BUSHFIRE SWEEPING BY WOULDN'T HARM HIM AND OF COURSE 
THIS EXPLAINS WHY NO ONE HAD SEEN THESE LITTLE LIZARDS FOR SO LONG 
THEY'RE VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND 
BUT WHAT'S REALLY SPECIAL ABOUT THIS LITTLE LIZARD IS ITS FAMILY LIFE 
JUST LOOK AT THESE SHOTS WE GOT WITH THAT OPTICAL PROBE 
THAT IS A CLOSE UP OF AN ADULT'S HEAD 
AND THERE JUST BESIDE HER HEAD IS A TINY LITTLE HEAD OF A BABY 
THAT'S ONE AND IF WE PUSH PAST HER 
THERE'S A BALEFUL LOOK OF MUM WHO DOESN'T APPRECIATE THIS 
AND BEYOND TWO 
TWO MORE BABIES SO THAT'S THREE 
QUITE A CROWDED LITTLE HOME 
SO THERE THEY ARE A NICE LITTLE LIZARD FAMILY 
AND THE BABIES WILL STAY IN THAT CROWDED HOLE FOR THREE WEEKS OR SO 
BEFORE THEY'RE READY TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT INTO THE OUTSIDE WORLD 
AND LOOK FOR A SPIDER'S BURROW FOR THEMSELVES 
THERE'S ANOTHER SKINK HERE WHOSE FAMILY RELATIONS LAST FOR DECADES 
THIS IS A SHINGLEBACK 
OR AS IT'S CALLED HERE IN ITS HOME IN AUSTRALIA 
A SLEEPY LIZARD 
IT'S REALLY QUITE A BAFFLING CREATURE BECAUSE 
ITS HEAD AND THE TAIL LOOK VERY SIMILAR 
MAYBE THAT CONFUSES THE PREDATOR 
BUT IF YOU GET CLOSER IT QUICKLY SHOWS WHICH END IS WHICH 
BY THREATENING WITH THIS GAPE DISPLAY 
HA HA 
OH YOU'RE VERY PERKY 
AND I HAVE TO BE REASONABLY CAREFUL 
BECAUSE IT CAN BITE 
BUT AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR IN THE SPRING 
IT ALSO HAS ANOTHER RATHER MORE GENTLE SIDE TO ITS CHARACTER 
THERE I'LL LET YOU GET ON WITH IT 
A FEMALE CATCHES THE EYE OF A MALE 
HE STARTS TO FOLLOW HER WHEREVER SHE GOES 
COUPLES STAY SIDE BY SIDE FOR UP TO TWO MONTHS 
HE COURTS HER BY GENTLY NUDGING AND LICKING HER 
SIX MONTHS PASS 
AND THEN EVENTUALLY THE RESULTS OF THIS PROLONGED COURTSHIP BEGIN TO ARRIVE 
IT'S A LONG AND STRENUOUS BUSINESS FOR A MOTHER SHINGLEBACK 
SHE PRODUCES NOT A SMALL EGG LIKE THE FIVE LINED SKINK 
BUT A LIVE BABY 
IT'S A WHOPPER 
AND THERE'S ANOTHER ONE TO COME 
TOGETHER THE TWO WEIGH AS MUCH AS A THIRD OF HER BODYWEIGHT 
THE EQUIVALENT IN HUMAN BEINGS OF CARRYING A THREE YEAR OLD CHILD 
LIKE THE CAPE CHAMELEON IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE FEMALE HAS BEEN ACTING AS A MOBILE INCUBATOR 
SEEKING OUT THE WARMEST SPOTS SHE CAN FIND IN ORDER TO BASK 
PRODUCING SUCH WELL DEVELOPED YOUNG IS THE SHINGLEBACK'S RESPONSE 
TO THE FACT THAT IT CAN GET QUITE COLD IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA 
HER YOUNG ARE SO ADVANCED THAT THEY SOON LEAVE HER 
BUT WHEN SPRING RETURNS THE SAME MALE AND FEMALE 
WILL ONCE AGAIN SEEK ONE ANOTHER OUT AND MATE AGAIN 
IN FACT A PAIR WILL REMAIN FAITHFUL TO ONE ANOTHER FOR AS LONG AS TWENTY YEARS OR MORE 
THE BOND BETWEEN THEM MAY EVEN ENDURE AFTER DEATH 
THEY'RE SLOW MOVING CREATURES AND ONLY TOO OFTEN 
WHEN CROSSING A ROAD 
THEY'RE UNABLE TO GET OUT OF THE WAY OF A PASSING CAR 
IF ONE OF THE PAIR IS RUN OVER 
THE OTHER WILL OFTEN REMAIN AT ITS SIDE FOR DAYS TENDERLY NUDGING IT 
YOU MIGHT EVEN SAY THAT IT WAS GRIEVING 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD 
THERE ARE LIZARDS WITH A VERY DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE 
THEY GATHER TOGETHER IN GROUPS WITH DENSITIES HIGHER THAN YOU CAN FIND ANYWHERE ELSE 
AND THE REASON THEY ARE ABLE TO DO SO 
YOU CAN SEE ALONGSIDE THE WATERS OF THIS 
THE ORANGE RIVER IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE RIVER IS THE BREEDING GROUND FOR VAST SWARMS OF BLACK FLIES 
EXCELLENT FOOD FOR A LIZARD IF IT CAN CATCH THEM 
IN THE EARLY MORNING THE AUGRABIES FLAT LIZARDS 
EMERGE FROM THE CRACKS IN THE ROCKS WHERE THEY'VE SPENT THE NIGHT 
AND BASK IN THE SUN TO WARM UP 
THE MALES ARE THE BRIGHTLY COLOURED ONES 
AS YOU CAN SEE FROM HIS MARVELLOUS BLUE HEAD 
BUT IT'S NOT HIS HEAD THAT IMPRESSES HIS RIVALS SO MUCH 
IT'S THE UNDERSIDE 
WHICH IF HE'S A HIGH STATUS MALE 
WILL BE BRIGHT ORANGE AND YELLOW 
AND IF ANOTHER ONE TURNS UP 
HE WILL TRY AND IMPRESS HIS RIVAL BY EXPOSING THAT 
THESE AWKWARD LOOKING POSTURES 
REVEAL WHY THESE CREATURES ARE CALLED FLAT LIZARDS 
BY REGULARLY DISPLAYING THEIR VIVID BADGES 
THE MALES REPEATEDLY CONFIRM 
THEIR PLACE IN THE PECKING ORDER AND SO KEEP FIGHTING TO A MINIMUM 
AS A FEMALE MOVES FROM ONE TERRITORY TO ANOTHER 
SO EACH MALE COURTS HER IN TURN 
AND NOW THEY'RE REALLY WARMED UP AND ACTIVE 
AND WHOLE GROUPS OF THEM BEGIN TO TRAVEL DOWN ACROSS THE ROCKS 
TOWARDS THE RIVER WHERE THEY'LL FIND THEIR FOOD 
BUT DOWN HERE WHERE THE FLIES SWARM IT'S A FREE FOR ALL 
AND THAT CAUSES A LOT OF TROUBLE 
CATCHING FLIES IS NECESSARILY AN ACROBATIC BUSINESS 
BUT YOU CAN'T LEAP FOR FLIES AND STILL KEEP PROPERLY SPACED OUT 
SO THERE ARE INEVITABLY QUARRELS BETWEEN RIVAL MALES 
FEMALES ON THE OTHER HAND ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN GETTING A GOOD MEAL 
FIRED UP MALES HOWEVER HAVE OTHER IDEAS 
FOR THEM THERE IS MORE TO LIFE THAN JUST DINNER 
AND SOME WON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER 
THE FEMALES WANT FOOD 
THEY NEED A SQUARE MEAL 
TO NOURISH THE EGGS THAT ARE DEVELOPING WITHIN THEM 
BUT THEY WON'T GET ANY PEACE UNTIL THEY LEAVE THE RESTAURANT 
AND GET BACK HOME WHERE LIFE IS BETTER REGULATED 
THE HIGH OCTANE SOCIAL LIFE OF THE FLAT LIZARDS 
WITH ITS CONSTANT SQUABBLING SEEMS TO BE VERY STRESSFUL 
BUT FOR OTHER LIZARDS 
FIGHTING IS LESS FREQUENT BUT ALTOGETHER MORE IMPRESSIVE 
A MEXICAN BEADED LIZARD 
ONE OF THE FEW LIZARDS IN THE WORLD WITH A POISONOUS BITE 
AND A VERY VIRULENT ONE IT IS TOO 
IN THE SPRING RIVAL MALES FIGHT 
ACCORDING TO A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF RULES 
THEY USE NEITHER THEIR SHARP POWERFUL CLAWS 
NOR THEIR POISONOUS BITE IN THEIR BATTLES 
AT FIRST THEY GRAPPLE RATHER WARILY TO ASSESS EACH OTHER'S STRENGTH 
THEN THEY BEGIN TO WRESTLE IN EARNEST 
EACH TRYING TO PIN DOWN THE OTHER ON THE GROUND 
THESE TWO ARE EVENLY MATCHED 
NEITHER CAN GET THE CRUCIAL THROW 
IT'S RATHER LIKE AN ARM WRESTLING CONTEST 
AND THE BOUT CAN CONTINUE FOR SEVERAL HOURS 
THE EVENTUAL WINNER IS THE ONE WHO ENDS UP ON TOP MOST FREQUENTLY 
IT'S A CONTROLLED TEST OF STRENGTH IN WHICH 
DESPITE THEIR LETHAL WEAPONRY NO ONE GETS SERIOUSLY HURT 
OTHER LIZARDS DEFEND THEMSELVES 
NOT WITH PHYSICAL STRENGTH BUT BY DECEIT 
THE SOUTH AFRICAN DESERT 
A BUSHVELD LIZARD 
THIS IS ANOTHER 
IT LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT BUT THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S A BABY 
IT NOT ONLY HAS DIFFERENT COLOURATION 
IT ALSO WALKS IN A VERY DIFFERENT AND QUITE EXTRAORDINARY WAY 
IT APPEARS TO BE IMITATING 
ONE OF THE LOCAL BEETLES 
THAT ONE 
AND TO DISCOVER WHY 
I'M GOING TO TAKE DEFENSIVE MEASURES WITH THESE GOGGLES 
THIS BEETLE IS KNOWN AS AN OOGPISTER AN EYE SPITTER 
AND THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S SQUIRTING FORMIC ACID AT ME 
YEAH AND IF ANY OF THAT GOT INTO MY EYE IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY PAINFUL 
IT'S A DEFENSIVE SYSTEM 
AND THE LIZARDS ARE BENEFITING 
BY IMITATING A BEETLE WITH THAT KIND OF ARMOURY 
A YOUNG LIZARD CLOSELY MATCHES THE BEETLE 
BOTH IN ITS APPEARANCE AND ITS WALK 
SO BIRDS THAT PREY ON LIZARDS 
ASSUME IT HAS A NASTY SPRAY AND LEAVE IT ALONE 
LIZARDS CAN COPE WITH DRY HOT CONDITIONS SO WELL 
THEY DOMINATE THE FAUNA IN TROPICAL DESERTS AROUND THE WORLD 
INCLUDING THOSE IN CENTRAL AUSTRALIA 
THEIR TOUGH SCALY SKINS PREVENT THEIR BODIES FROM LOSING MOISTURE 
SO THAT THEY CAN FLOURISH IN THESE 
ARID BAKING HOT LANDS THAT OTHER ANIMALS FIND SO TESTING 
SOME WEAR THE MOST ELABORATE SUITS OF ARMOUR 
THIS IS SURELY THE MOST ENCHANTING OF LIZARDS 
IT'S CALLED THE THORNY DEVIL OR MOLOCH 
AFTER MOLOCH THE GOD IN THE BIBLE WHO ATE LITTLE CHILDREN 
BOTH NAMES SURELY ARE A SLANDER 
ON SUCH AN ENGAGING LITTLE ANIMAL 
IT FEEDS ENTIRELY ON ANTS 
AND AS YOU CAN SEE 
THERE'S NOT MUCH OF A MEAL IN ANY ONE OF THEM 
BUT THE GOOD THING ABOUT ANTS AS FAR AS MOLOCH IS CONCERNED 
IS THAT THERE'S ALWAYS SOME AROUND 
AND THIS LITTLE CREATURE 
WILL SIT BY AN ANT TRAIL PATIENTLY 
FOR HOURS ON END 
SIMPLY PICKING OFF ONE ANT AT A TIME 
THE AUSTRALIAN DESERT IS ALSO HOME 
TO ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL OF THE FAMILY 
MONITORS ARE THE KINGS OF LIZARDS 
AND THIS IS THE PERENTIE 
THE BIGGEST SPECIES OF MONITOR IN AUSTRALIA 
IT CAN GROW UP TO TWO METRES LONG SIX FEET 
AND IT'S A HIGHLY INTELLIGENT ANIMAL 
IT'S GOT VERY ACUTE SENSES OF SIGHT AND HEARING AND TASTE AND SMELL 
AND LIKE ALL MONITORS IT CAN DO SOMETHING NO OTHER LIZARD CAN DO 
IT CAN RUN CONTINUOUSLY FOR A VERY LONG TIME 
AND THAT ENABLES IT TO BECOME AN ENDURANCE HUNTER 
CHASING DOWN ITS PREY 
MOST LIZARDS INFLATE THEIR LUNGS USING THE SAME MUSCLES THEY USE FOR WALKING 
SO THEY CAN'T RUN AND BREATHE EFFECTIVELY AT THE SAME TIME 
BUT MONITORS HAVE BIG MUSCULAR THROATS 
WHICH THEY USE LIKE BELLOWS TO PUMP AIR 
INTO THEIR LUNGS 
AND THEY CAN DO THAT EVEN WHEN THEY'RE RUNNING 
THIS SPECIAL WAY OF BREATHING 
ENABLES THEM TO REACH SPEEDS OF OVER TWENTY MILES AN HOUR 
OVER DISTANCE THEY ARE ONE OF THE FASTEST OF ALL REPTILES 
THE COLD BLOODED PERENTIE CAN EVEN OUT RUN A WARM BLOODED RABBIT 
SO THE LIZARDS HAVE COLONISED THE WORLD 
FROM SWAMPS TO RAINFORESTS FROM WOODLAND TO DESERT 
AND IN DOING SO THEY REVEAL SUCH A VARIETY OF FORM AND BEHAVIOUR 
THAT THEY TRULY CAN BE CALLED THE DRAGONS OF THE DRY 
MUCH OF OUR FILMING FOR THIS PROGRAMME WAS DONE IN AUSTRALIA 
THERE THERE ARE LIZARDS EVERYWHERE 
JUST WALK AROUND IN THE BUSH AND YOU'LL SEE THEM 
BUT USUALLY YOU WON'T GET MUCH MORE THAN A BRIEF GLIMPSE 
TO FILM THEIR INTIMATE BEHAVIOUR WE NEEDED HELP FROM EXPERTS 
WE TRAVELLED TO AUSTRALIA TO MEET AN EXPERT CALLED MIKE BULL 
HE KNOWS AUSTRALIAN LIZARDS AS WELL AS ANYONE 
HE AND HIS TEAM STUDY MANY SPECIES IN ONE SMALL AREA NORTH OF ADELAIDE 
USING ALL MANNER OF GADGETS AND GIZMOS 
TO INVESTIGATE EVERY PART OF THEIR LIVES 
WE ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE LIZARDS 
THAT MIKE UNDERSTANDS BEST OF ALL THE SHINGLEBACK OR SLEEPY LIZARD 
HE KNOWS TEN THOUSAND OF THEM INDIVIDUALLY 
ON THE FACE OF IT THE SLEEPY LIZARD DOESN'T SEEM TO DO A LOT 
BUT MIKE KNOWS SO MUCH ABOUT THEM 
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE THEM ONE OF THE STARS OF OUR FILM 
HE'S DISCOVERED THAT THEY'RE THE ONLY LIZARDS IN THE WORLD 
THAT REMAIN FAITHFUL TO ONE PARTNER FOR ALL THEIR LIVES 
BUT THAT WASN'T THE REASON THAT HE BEGAN TO STUDY THEM 
TELL ME FIRST HOW YOU FIRST SAW SLEEPY LIZARDS 
AND WHAT ATTRACTED YOU TO THEM 
I STARTED BECAUSE I WAS INTERESTED IN PARASITES THAT LIVE ON THE LIZARD 
TO FIND THE PARASITES I HAD TO LOOK AT THE LIZARDS 
AND DISCOVERED THEY WERE MORE INTERESTING THAN THE PARASITES 
I THINK THEY'RE ONE OF THE MOST HANDSOME ANIMALS YOU'LL EVER FIND 
THE OTHER THING IS IT'S PROBABLY THE ONLY ANIMAL THAT 
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE DRIVING IN A CAR AND SEE ONE ONE HUNDRED METRES DOWN THE ROAD YOU KNOW YOU'VE CAUGHT IT 
AND IT'S ALSO ONE THAT I THINK I'M GOING TO BE SUFFICIENTLY AGILE 
TO KEEP ON CATCHING UNTIL I'M WELL PAST EIGHTY 
AND EVEN I I THINK COULD SCRAG A SLEEPY LIZARD 
I'LL SEE WHETHER I CAN MANAGE IT 
SLEEPY LIZARDS LIKE TO BASK ON WARM ROADS SO THEY'RE EASY TO FIND 
AND THEY MOVE SO SLOWLY THEY'RE EASY TO PICK UP 
SO THE TEAM WERE ABLE TO WEIGH AND MEASURE A WHOLE POPULATION 
AND THUS DISCOVERED THAT PAIRS REMAINED TOGETHER IN A WAY 
THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY KNOWN ONLY IN BIRDS AND MAMMALS 
BUT THAT WAS JUST THE START 
NEXT THEY TURNED TO TECHNOLOGY 
SOME OF IT ADVANCED SOME A LITTLE BIZARRE 
THEY USED REMOTELY CONTROLLED RUBBER SLEEPY LIZARDS 
TO TEST HOW LIZARDS REACTED TO ONE ANOTHER 
IN THIS CASE NOT VERY MUCH 
MIKE'S TEAM SUSPECTED THAT ANOTHER LIZARD IN THE AREA 
THE GIDGEE SKINK HAD AN EVEN MORE COMPLEX SOCIAL LIFE 
BUT THIS WAS DIFFICULT TO PROVE BECAUSE WHEN APPROACHED 
THE SKINKS WEDGED THEMSELVES IN CRACKS IN THE ROCKS MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY WHO'S WHO 
THE SOLUTION WAS TO MICROCHIP EACH LIZARD 
SO IT COULD THEN BE SCANNED JUST LIKE YOUR SUPERMARKET SHOPPING 
WITH A BARCODE READER ON THE END OF A POLE 
THIS CLEVER USE OF TECHNOLOGY 
REVEALED WHAT LOOKED LIKE A JUMBLE OF LIZARDS ON A PILE OF ROCKS 
TO BE ACTUALLY A LITTLE LIZARD FAMILY WITH YOUNG 
THAT STAY WITH THEIR PARENTS FOR LIFE 
I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE MANY OTHER COMPLEX SOCIAL ORGANISATIONS 
THAT WILL BE UNCOVERED IN THOSE SPECIES IF WE JUST SIMPLY TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK AT THEM 
BUT IT'S JUST THE TIME AND THE PATIENCE TO WATCH THEM 
AND WATCHING A LIZARD IS VERY UNREWARDING 
BECAUSE THEY WILL COME OUT AND BASK SIT BY A BUSH 
AND IF THEY SEE YOU'RE THERE THEY'LL DECIDE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO VERY MUCH FOR THE REST OF THE DAY 
TO FIND OUT JUST WHAT SLEEPY LIZARDS GET UP TO WHEN NO ONE'S AROUND 
MIKE'S TEAM USE A RATHER BIZARRE DEVICE THEY CALL A WADDLEOMETER 
IT MAY LOOK A LITTLE ODD BUT IT RECORDS A LIZARD'S G. P. S. CO ORDINATES 
COUNTS ITS STEPS AND EVEN NOTES WHETHER IT'S IN SUN OR SHADE 
ALL WITHOUT TROUBLING THE LIZARD AND WITHOUT ANYONE HAVING TO BE THERE 
SO YOU THINK THERE'S PROBABLY THE SECRET WORLD OF THE LIZARD 
WHICH NO HUMAN BEING HAS EVER SEEN 
BECAUSE IF A HUMAN BEING IS THERE THE LIZARD WON'T BEHAVE THAT WAY 
I'M SURE THAT'S PART OF IT IT'S THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE 
THE CLOSER YOU GET TO WATCH SOMETHING THE LESS NORMALLY IT'S BEHAVING 
AND SO IT'S ONLY BY GETTING THESE REMOTE AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES 
THAT ALLOW US TO REALLY GET INTO THE SECRET WORLD OF THE LIZARDS 
THAT WE CAN FIND THESE AMAZING THINGS THAT THEY'RE DOING 
HOW EXTRAORDINARY 
ONE OF THEIR LATEST TECHNIQUES USES MINIATURE CAMERAS WHICH THEY USE TO STUDY 
A VERY SPECIAL LIZARD THAT WE WERE ALSO PARTICULARLY KEEN TO FILM 
IT'S SO RARE THAT IT WAS THOUGHT TO BE EXTINCT FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS 
UNTIL IT WAS THRUST BACK INTO THE PUBLIC EYE 
WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED IN SOME VERY UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES 
A GROUP OF BIOLOGISTS WERE DOING A STANDARD BIOLOGICAL SURVEY 
THEY WERE JUST COMING BACK TO TOWN TO PICK UP SUPPLIES AND JUST ON THE ROAD THEY SAW A DEAD BROWN SNAKE 
MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T EVEN LOOK AT IT AS THEY'RE SO COMMON AROUND HERE 
BUT THESE WERE DEDICATED BIOLOGISTS 
THEY HAD A LOOK NOTICED THERE WAS A BULGE 
SO THEY THOUGHT LET'S SEE WHAT IT'S BEEN EATING 
OPENED IT UP AND THERE WAS THIS LIZARD THAT NO ONE HAD SEEN FOR THIRTY YEARS THE PYGMY BLUE TONGUED LIZARD 
HOW LOVELY THOUGH I DARE SAY IT WASN'T ALL THAT LOVELY WHEN THEY ACTUALLY SAW IT 
MINIATURE CAMERAS HAVE PRODUCED IMAGES 
THAT ARE SLOWLY HELPING TO BUILD UP A COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THE LIFE OF THESE RARE LITTLE CREATURES 
THEIR BURROWS ARE MORE THAN JUST HOMES 
THEY'RE ALSO HIDING PLACES WHERE THEY CAN WAIT IN AMBUSH FOR SPIDERS AND CRICKETS 
BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TOO KEEN ON ANTS 
THEY ALSO SERVE AS BOLT HOLES WHEN DANGER APPROACHES 
DESPITE ALL THIS WORK 
MIKE'S TEAM HAD NEVER RECORDED THEIR LIFE UNDERGROUND 
SO WE WERE ABLE TO HELP WITH A LITTLE OF OUR OWN TECHNOLOGY 
AND RECORD THE FIRST EVER PICTURES OF A PYGMY BLUE TONGUE FAMILY 
THREE BABIES ALONGSIDE THEIR MOTHER IN THEIR LITTLE HOLE 
BUT ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY INGENIOUS THOUGH IT IS 
IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR YEARS OF DEDICATED OBSERVATION 
MIKE'S APPROACH OF SIMPLY DRIVING FOR MILES ACROSS THE AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK 
IS VERY FRUITFUL AND YOU SEE LOTS OF OTHER THINGS AS WELL AS LIZARDS 
UP HERE IS JUST A WONDERFUL PLACE FOR LIZARDS AND KANGAROOS 
HA BOY EASTERN GREY BEAUTIFUL 
NOW YOU WON'T CATCH A LIZARD DOING THAT 
OH LOOK THERE'S A PAIR JUST DOWN THERE 
IT TURNED OUT THAT MIKE HAD SPOTTED TWO OLD FRIENDS 
THIS IS THE MALE AND THE FEMALE 
THIS IS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO AND THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
I THINK THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS REALLY 
WE'VE GOT SOME OTHER PAIRS THAT HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS 
THEY STAY TOGETHER DURING THE SPRINGTIME 
AND MATE TOWARDS THE END OF THE SPRING AND THEN THEY SEPARATE 
BUT THE NEXT YEAR THE SAME TWO LIZARDS 
WE'LL FIND THEM BACK TOGETHER AGAIN USUALLY IN THE SAME PLACE ALONG THIS ROAD 
AREN'T THEY TERRIFIC 
THEY USE THEIR TONGUES TO PICK UP CHEMICAL SIGNALS 
AND YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE ACTUALLY SENSING EACH OTHER AT THE MOMENT 
I THINK THAT'S REALLY VERY TOUCHING 
I'D SAY THAT'S A RISKY BUSINESS 
WITH OBSESSIVE DEDICATION AND EVER ADVANCING TECHNOLOGY 
WHO KNOWS WHAT MIKE AND HIS TEAM WILL UNCOVER 
ABOUT THE SECRET LIVES OF SLEEPY LIZARDS
