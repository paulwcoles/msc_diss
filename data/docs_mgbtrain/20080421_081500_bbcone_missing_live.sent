TO FIND HIM HAS MEANT AL DEMANDING 
ROUND OF RADIO PRESS AND T. V. 
INTERVIEWS INTERVIEWS ANDREW IS ONLY FOURTEEN BUT HE LOOKS 
EVEN YOUNGER HE IS A BRIGHT BOY 
GOOD AT SCHOOL BUT HE IS ALSO VERY 
SHY SHY HE IS GOOD COMPANY HE IS WITTY HE 
WAS JUST GENTLE AND A PLEASURE TO 
BE AROUND REALLY 
YOU WOULD NORMALLY FIND ANDREW AT 
SOME POINT EVERY NIGHT OR EVERY DAY 
LIKE THIS WITH HIS XBOX GAME THAT I 
CAN'T WORK CLICK CLICK CLICK ON 
THE XBOX THIS IS NORMAL POSTURE 
FOR HIM 
THIS IS ANDREW'S ROOM TYPICAL OF 
MANY TEENAGE BOYS IT HAS HIS 
SNOOKER TABLE THAT HE LIKES A LOT 
AND YOU CAN HEAR THAT HE IS AROUND 
BECAUSE WE CAN BE DOWNSTAIRS AND WE 
WILL HEAR HIM PUTTING THE BALLS IN 
THE TABLE 
HE HAD A SMALL GROUP OF FRIENDS AT 
SCHOOL BUT HE DIDN'T TEN TO GO OUT 
IF YOU HET HIM YOU HET MINIMUM 
YOU WOULD HIM YOU WOULD THINK WHAT 
A QUIET WELL MANNERED BOY HE WAS 
THOUGHTFUL AND CARING ABOUT PEOPLE 
LAST SEPTEMBER AND THE START OF 
THE NEW SCHOOL TERM 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SCHOOL 
BECAUSE HE HAD A FEW NEW TEACHERS 
THIS YEAR AND I WAS ASKING HOW IS 
MR. SO AND SO AND MISS WHAT'S HER 
NAME AND WHATEVER AND HE WAS JUST 
NORMAL NORMAL NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY AT ALL 
QUITE RELAXED 
FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 
FOURTEENTH AND ANDREW'S UP AND OUT EARLY 
HE SHOT OUT FOR SCHOOL IN HIS 
UNIFORM WE WERE LITTLE BIT LATE 
GETTING UP 
KEVIN AND GLENYS GO OFF TO WORK AND 
GET BACK HOME ABOUT FIVE P. M. EXPECTING 
TO FIND ANG DREW THERE AS ANDREW 
THERE AS USUAL 
WE JUST MADE AN 
ASSUMPTION THAT ANDREW HAD COME IN 
FROM SCHOOL AND WAS IN HIS ROOM OR 
IN OUR CONVERTED CELLAR ROOM AND WE 
CALLED HIM FOR TEA AND WE REALISED 
THAT HE WASN'T IN THE HOUSE 
AT FIRST GLENYS AND KEVIN AREN'T 
TOO CONCERNED FINDING ANDREW'S 
SCHOOL UNIFORM ON THE BACK OF THE 
CHAIR IN HIS BEDROOM THEY THINK HE 
MUST BE BE BE AT HIS FRIEND'S HOUSE 
WE THOUGHT DID HE FORGET HIS KEY 
AND GO TO OUR FRIEND'S WHERE THE 
SPARE IS AND GET CHATTING 
WORTHWHILE HIS SON AND WHEN THAT 
TURNED OUT OUT TO BE WRONG WE 
STARTED GETTING WORRIED 
BY EIGHT HUNDRED P. M. THAT EVENING ANDREW IS 
STILL NOT HOME 
SO WE GOT TO THE POINT OF TRYING TO 
CONTACT SCHOOLING AND WE WERE 
SCHOOL AND WE WERE ABLE TO FIND OUT 
THAT HE NEVER TURNED UP AT SCHOOL 
IN THE MORNING 
AS THE HOUR PROGRESSED WE KNEW 
SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT AND WE 
KICKED THINGS INTO MOTION AND WE 
PHONED THE POLICE 
THE SEARCH FOR ANDREW IS A TOP 
PRIORITY FOR SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE 
ANDREW WAS CATEGORISE AS A 
VULNERABLE HIGH RISK VULNERABLE 
MISSING PERSON DUE TO HIS AND THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES HE HAS WENT MISSING 
AND THIS HAS BEEN TREATED AS A 
MAJOR INCIDENT 
SUDDENLY THE INVESTIGATION TAKES AN 
UNEXPECTED TURN 
IT APPEARS THE FOURTEEN YEAR OLD HAS 
PLANNED HIS DISAPPEARANCE 
ANDREW WENT MISSING IN THE MORNING 
WHEN HIS PARENTS HAD LEFT FOR WORK 
AND HE HAS RETURNED WHEN HE KNOWS 
THERE WILL BE NO ONE IN HE HAD THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE AND COLLECT 
WHATEVER ITEMS HE NEEDED 
LATER IN THE PROGRAMME THE 
DISCOVERY THAT ANDREW'S BOUGHT A 
ONE WAY TICKET TO LONDON 
HE MUST OF GONE TO THE CASH TILL 
AND GOT A COUPLE OF HUNDRED QUID 
OUT AND GOT A TRAIN TO KING'S CROSS 
C. C. T. V. CONFIRMS ANDREW IS IN THE 
CAPITAL BUT WHAT WILL POLICE 
SEARCHES REVEAL 
YOU WERE STOOD DOWN AT THAT END OF 
THE JUNCTION WHEN YOU LOST SIGHT OF 
HIS HIM YES YES THAT IS A REALLY WORRYING STORY WE 
WILL RETURN TO KEVIN AND GLENYS 
GOSDEN SEARCH FOR ANDREW LATER 
HERE TO EXPLAIN HOW A NEW PIECE OF 
TECHNOLOGY COULD HAVE STOPPED 
ANDREW GOING MISSING IS SIR BOB 
GELDOF GELDOF LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU AS WELL 
BECAUSE YOU YOURSELF HAVE WHAT 
SLEPT ROUGH YEAH YEAH WHY DID YOU DO THAT 
I THINK AT A 
CERTAIN POINT YOUNG KIDS ARE GOING 
FOR IT THEY PITCH UP IN LONDON AND 
TRYING TO GET THEIR BEARINGS THEY 
HAVE NOWHERE TO STAY AND I JUST 
ARRIVED FROM IRELAND AND I DON'T 
KNOW SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN AND I SLEPT ON THE 
STREET FOR A WHILE BUT WE WOULD GO 
TO HOLLOWAY NOT HOLLOWAY HO 
HOLBOURNE AND SOMETIMES WE WOULD 
SLEEP AT GATWICK AIRPORT MY DAD IF 
I BOTHERED CONTACTING HIM I 
PRETENDED I WAS LIVING IN A B. AND AMP B. OR 
SOMETHING BUT I WASN'T AND I SOLD 
HOT DOGS YOU KNOW THOSE TROLLEYS 
AND SOMETIMES SPENT THE NIGHT IN 
VINE STREET POLICE STATION AS A 
RESULT AND I LIVED IN A A SQUAT FOR 
A YEAR UP IN TUFNELL PARK IT IS 
BEGINNING TO WORK OUT YOUR LIFE AND 
THE CITY WHICH IS SEPARATE TO 
POSSIBLY THE PARENTS WHO ARE 
WATCHING THIS IT WASN'T FUN BUT 
IT WASN'T TOO DISTRESSING BECAUSE 
YOU UNDERSTOOD U. M. P. YOUNG AND THESE 
THINGS WEREN'T THAT TROUBLE SOME TO 
YOU YOU ANDREW IS AGED FOURTEEN 
THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING 
HE DIDN'T GO TO SCHOOL THAT DAY 
THEY DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL FIVE P. M. THAT HE 
HAD GONE MISSING HOW WOULD YOUR 
TECHNOLOGY HELP IN THAT SITUATION 
WELL IT WOULD HAVE ALERTED HIS 
PARENTS THAT HE HADN'T ARRIVED AT 
SCHOOL AND IN HIS SITUATION THAT 
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN POSITIVE 
TO THE PARENTS BUT THEY WOULD HAVE 
GOT ON TO THE SCHOOL AND THEN ON TO 
THE POLICE AND I'M NOT SAYING IT 
WOULD HAVE STOPPED WHAT HAPPENED 
BUT THE POLICE COULD HAVE CONTACTED 
THE STATION AND THEY MAY HAVE BEEN 
TOO LATE TO GET HIM ON THE TRAIN 
BUT THERE COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEONE 
AT THE OTHER END SAYING WHAT ARE 
YOU DOING IT IS A SIMPLE PIECE OF 
KIT IF A KID DOESN'T ARRIVE AT 
SCHOOL IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO THE 
RELEVANT PARENT IN WHATEVER 
LANGUAGE YOU LIKE THAT YOUR KID 
ISN'T THERE AND THAT IS IT IS 
USED FOR TRUANCY BUT CAN BE USED 
FOR ANY SWIGS SITUATION IT CAN 
TELL YOU ABOUT THE SOCCER FIXTURE 
HAS BEEN MOVED THE SCHOOL PLAY IS 
ANOTHER WEEK HERE ARE THE EXAM 
RESULTS IN MY CASE I THOUGHT IT 
WAS PERFECT BECAUSE IT IS WHAT NEW 
TECHNOLOGY IS MEANT TO DO IT IS 
CHEAP IT IS LESS THAN A QUID PER 
PUPIL HER YEAR AND SAVES THE SCHOOL 
MONEY ONE OF MY GIRLS HAD STARTED 
CROSSING LONDON TO GO TO HER 
SECONDARY SCHOOL AND I JUST DIDN'T 
FANCY THE BUS ON THOSE DARK WINTER 
MORNINGS AND I WANTED TO KNOW SHE 
ARRIVED AT SCHOOL AND WHAT FEAR 
MUST BE PRESENT IN MOST PARENTS AND 
I THOUGHT THAT'S A GOOD THING TO DO 
IT IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY BUT IT IS 
ALSO A NEW THING THAT IS BOUND TO 
HAPPEN WITH SCHOOLS AND AT THE 
MOMENT IT IS IN HUNDREDS OF SCHOOLS 
IT IS IT IS CALLED GROUP SCAL CALL 
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR SIR 
BOB GELDOF HE WILL BE HERE 
IS YOUR E. MAIL WORKING 
IT WILL BE 
WORKING WORKING THAT WILL BE THE DAY 
IT IS MISSING LIVEUK

IF SOMEONE YOU KNOW GOES MISSING 
ALL YOU LONG FOR IS THE DAY THEY

FAMILY THAT REUNION TOOK FOUR YEARS 
THIRTY SIX YEAR OLD ALEX MORRIS IS THE 
YOUNGEST IN HIS FAMILY 
ALONG WITH HIS BROTHER AND SISTER 
HE GREW UP IN MAIDENHEAD IN 
BERKSHIRE BERKSHIRE ALEX WAS LIKE ANY NORMAL CHILD 
BOISTEROUS QUITE A HANDFUL 
GETTING IN TROUBLE AS IN LIKE 
DENNIS THE MENACE STYLE TROUBLE 
NOT BAD TROUBLE 
HE WAS MORE BABY BROTHER AND HE WAS 
THE BABY OF THE FAMILY HE WAS A 
VERY NAUGHTY LITTLE BOY BUT FUN TO 
BE AROUND 
WE USED TO GO FISHING WALKING IN 
THE WOODS WE USE TODAY TAKE THE 
DOGS FOR LONG WALKS JUST BASIC 
NORMAL CHILDHOOD 
WE WERE BROUGHT UP IN A HAPPY 
FAMILY A HAPPY ENVIRONMENT THERE

I WAS VERY DADDY'S GIRL ALEX WAS 
VERY CLOSE TO DAD AS WELL THEY HAD 
THEIR ARGUMENTS BUT DEEP DOWN YOU

BUT AFTER A LONG FIGHT WITH CANCER 
ALEX'S DAD DIED SIX YEARS AGO 
THAT AFFECTED ALEC REALLY REALLY 
BAD I THINK IT BROKE HIM DOWN HE 
COULDN'T ACCEPT THAT HE HAD LOST 
HIS DAD BECAUSE HE IS THE SPITTING 
IMAGE OF MY DAD EVERYTHING HE DOES 
IS A REMINDER OF MY DAD 
HE ALWAYS CALLED HIS DAD HIS BEST 
FRIEND FRIEND SO WHEN HIS BEST FRIEND DIED THAT 
WAS IT 
HE JUST WENT TO PIECES 
OVER THE NEXT YEAR ALEX SLOWLY WITH 
DRAWS FROM HIS FAMILY HE IS 
CLEARLY STRUGGLING TO COME TO TERMS 
WITH THE LOSS OF HIS DAD 
IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO KNOW 
WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH HIM BECAUSE 
I WAS TRYING TO COMFORT ME MUM AND 
GRIEVE MYSELF SO IT WAS DIFFICULT 
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS GOING 
THROUGH THROUGH HE GOT MARRIED AND IT WASN'T VERY 
HAPPY MARRIAGE HE WASN'T HIS HAPPY 
HAPPY HIMSELF LIKE HE USED TO BE 
WHEN WE WERE KIDS L. THINK 
EVERYTHING GOT ON TOP OF HIM HE

SAVINGS WHAT WAS HE PLANNING 
WE'VE SPOKEN TO THE LADY AT THE 
TICKET OFFICE WHO SOLD ANDREW THE 
TICKET AND INTERESTINGLY HE 
BOUGHT A SINGLE TICKET WHEN A 
RETURN WOULD HAVE COST JUST FIFTY P. 
MORE WHICH POSSIBLY INDICATES HE 
WAS NOT INTENDING ON COMING BACK 
HOME 
WHY HAS ANDREW TRAVELLED TO HOME LONDON OFFICERS HAVE TRAWLED 
THROUGH MASSES OF C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE AT 
KING'S CROSS AND EVENTUALLY FIND 
WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR ANDREW IS 
FILMED LEAVING THE STATION AT ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
ON FRIDAY FOURTEENTH SEPTEMBER THE 
MORNING HE WENT MISSING FROM HERE 
HE SIMPLY DISAPPEARS ON TO THE 
STREETS OF LONDON WHERE IS HE 
GOING WHAT DOES HE HAVE PLANNED 
TO FIND ANDREW IN A CITY OF SEVEN 
MILLION PEOPLE IS NOT GOING TO BE 
EASY AND THE POLICE KNOW IT 
SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE OFFICERS 
HAVE TRAVELLED DOWN TO LONDON 
SEVERAL TIMES LIAISING WITH POLICE 
DOWN THERE AND THE BRITISH 
TRANSPORT POLICE CHECKING C. C. T. V. 
SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY AND THERE 
HAS BEEN A BIG MEDIA CAMPAIGN 
ANDREW'S PARENTS HAVE BEEN HEAVILY 
INVOLVED AND WE'VE BEEN LIAISING 
CLOSELY WITH THEM 
ANDREW'S MUM AND 
DAD ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN 
TO MAKE SURE THEIR SON IS NOT 
FORGOTTEN AND GETTING PUBLICITY IS 
VITAL TO THEIR SEARCH 
IT VARIOUS FROM MEDIA PRESS 
ORGANISATIONS TO PEOPLE RINGING IN 
DIRECTLY WITH POSSIBLE SIGHTINGS 
SO IT ALL NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH 
YOU NEVER QUITE KNOW WHO IS GOING 
TO BE AT THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE 
O. K. THANKS BYE BYE SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE 
KEVIN AND 
GLENYS GET A TIP OFF FROM SOMEONE 
IN LONDON THAT ONE OF THEIR MISSING 
POSTERS IN LONDON HAS A MESSAGE 
WRITTEN ON IT COULD ANDREW HAVE 
BEEN THERE THEY HAVE TO SEE FOR 
THEMSELVES THEMSELVES WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK FOR THE POSTER 
WHERE APPARENTLY 
FRIEND OF A FRIEND SAID LOOK SOMEBODY HAD 
WRITTEN ON IT THAT THEY HAD SEEN 
ANDREW SLEEPING IN THIS AREA A 
FEW WEEKS AGO BUT WE'RE NOT 
EXACTLY SURE WHERE THAT POSTER WAS 
OR IF IT WILL STILL BE THERE 
THEY HAVE THE POSTERS UP IN THERE 
BUT THEY SAID NONE OF THEIR GUYS 
HAVE SEEN ANYTHING THAT COME IN 
REGULARLY 
THERE IS A SECOND UNCONFIRMED 
SIGHTING OF ANDREW IN A PARK ON THE 
SOUTH BANK NEAR THE LONDON 
ASSEMBLY ASSEMBLY THERE WAS ONE SIGHTING WHERE 
SOMEBODY HAD SEEN THEM THEY 
THOUGHT WHEN THEY WERE PICKING UP 
THEIR KIDS FROM SCHOOL JUST 
WALKING THROUGH TWO OR THREE TIMES 
KEVIN GOES IN TO ASK IF ANYONE 
WORKING THERE HAS SEEN ANDREW 
THEY TOOK US TO AN INFORMATION DESK 
AND THEY ARE HOPEFULLY GOING TO 
BE ABLE TO GET IT ON THEIR INTRANET 
WITHIN THE OFFICES SO THAT PEOPLE 
WHO ARE WORKING THERE AND COMING 
AND GOING FROM THE BUILDING MIGHT 
BE ABLE TO SEE IT AS WELL IT'S 
ANOTHER WITHIN OF THOSE STRAWS 
PERHAPS BUT ANOTHER BIT OF THE 
JIGSAW MAYBE 
AFTER MORE HOURS OF 
SEARCHING KEVIN AND GLENYS FIND 
THE POSTER THEY'RE LOOKING FOR BUT 
IT DOES NOT BRING THEM CLOSER TO 
THEIR SON THAT 
GIVES POSSIBLE 
THEIR SON INFORMATION OF WHEN HE WAS SEEN 
POSSIBLY SLEEPING ROUGH HERE BUT BUT THIS IS A MONTH LATER AND NOT 
KNOWING GLENYS'S HAND WRITING AND 
THEY'VE SEEN IT AND LET US KNOW 
BUT IN A WAY THAT IS STILL GOOD 
BECAUSE PERHAPS IT INDICATES THAT 
HE HAS NOT COME BACK TO THIS AREA 
EVEN IF IT WAS HIM THEN YES IT YES IT HAS BEEN A DISAPPOINTING DAY FOR 
GLENYS AND KEVIN ALL THEIR LEADS 
HAVE GONE NOWHERE BUT THERE IS 
HOWEVER SOME POSITIVE NEWS LATER 
IN THE PROGRAMME GLENYS AND KEVIN 
MAKE AN URGENT APPEAL ON BREAKFAST 
TELEVISION IT RESULTS IN DOZENS OF 
CALLS AND COULD SOMEONE IN CENTRAL 
LONDON HAVE SPOTTED THEIR SON 
IF THIS IS THE PERSON I MIGHT HAVE 
SEEN SOMEBODY LOOKING LIKE HIM WITH 
TWO GIRLS HERE THAT DAY 
WHEN DO 
YOU THINK THAT WAS 
WELL LET'S HOPE THAT IS A POSITIVE 
LEAD NOW DO YOU REMEMBER THIS T. 
SHIRT CAN YOU SPOT IT IN THIS 
CROWD SEARCHING FOR SOMEBODY IN A 
CROWD IS ONE OF THE MOST TIME 
CONSUMING JOBS FOR THE POLICE WHEN 
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A MISSING 
PERSON WE'RE JOINED BY DAVID WHOSE 
COMPANY CLAIMS TO HAVE DEVELOPED A 
SYSTEM THAT WILL AUTOMATICALLY 
IDENTIFY SOMEONE AMONGST HOURS OF 
C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE THIS IS FASCINATING 
BUT WHAT IS IT AND HOW DOES IT 
WORK 
IT PRODUCES AN AUTOMATIC WORK BRAIN BLIND THE AUTOMATIC EYES A 
LOT OF CAMERAS ARE OUT THERE 
LOOKING AND LOOKING GREAT EYES 
BUT WHAT TO THEY SEE AND KNOW 
BECAUSE THE CAMERAS CANNOT THINK OR 
INTERPRETMENT 
WE'VE HAD SOME INTERPRETMENT FOOTAGE THAT YOU'VE TREATED CAN 
YOU TELL US WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
THERE 
WE SEE A BUSY STREET THERE THERE YES YOU WENT OUT WITH A CAMERA AND 
TOOK RANDOM SHOTS OF THE CROWD AND 
THERE IS ONE OF YOUR PRESENTERS 
WEARING A T. SHIRT THAT CAN BE 
IDENTIFIED WHEN WE SAW ANDREW 
GOSDEN EARLIER ON WITH THAT 
DISTINCTIVE T. SHIRT IF WE COULD 
HAVE CAUGHT HIM AT KING'S CROSS WE 
COULD HAVE TRACED HIM ALL OVER 
LONDON'S SYSTEM WITH THAT TRACE WE 
LIKE TO THINK THIS IS THE EYES OF 
THE COMMUNITY USING THE C. C. T. V. IT 
TAKES A LOT OF POLICE TIME FOR THE 
POLICE TO LOOK AT THE C. T. V. FATTAGE 
AND FOR THE PARENTS TO LOOK HOW HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU THINK IT COULD 
SAVE 
I DON'T WANT TO ADVERTISE SAVE BUT IT COULD SAVE A LOT OF TIME 
AND WE'RE GET AGO LOT OF CALLS 
ABOUT WHICH COULD SAVE 
TIME ALSO 
IT IS THE SAME THING 
IT'S A SORT OF TECHNOLOGICAL 
RESPONSE TO SOMETHING THAT IS 
DISTRESSING AND THESE THINGS ARE 
AVAILABLE NOW AND ALMOST AT A COST 
FREE BASIS AND WE'RE IN HUNDREDS 
OF SCHOOLS AT THE MOMENT SOMETHING 
THAT HAPPENED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO 
WHICH WAS AWFUL A LITTLE BOY WAS 
DROPPED OFF AT SCHOOL BY HIS 
PARENTS AND BETWEEN THE THE PARENTS 
AND THE SCHOOL GATE HE WAS 
KIDNAPPED AND MURDERED AND 
SUBSEQUENTLY THE AUTHORITY HAS 
TAKEN GROUPCALL NOT BECAUSE OF 
THIS BUT IT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS 
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT IF 
GROUPCALL HAD BEEN THERE IT WOULD 
HAVE PREVENTED IT BUT CERTAINLY 
THOSE FIRST FEW HOURS THAT KEY 
MOMENT ONCE THE POLICE KNOW AND 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAY HAVE 
HELPED WAS THAT IMMEDIATELY THE 
PARENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN ALERTED 
THAT HE HAD NOT ARRIVED AT THE 
SCHOOL DOOR HE HAD LEFT THE CAR 
BUT NOT ARRIVED AT THE SCHOOL AND 
THIS SYSTEM WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY 
ALERTED THEM 
AND YOU MENTION THIS 
CRITICAL FIRST FEW HOURS YES AND YES AND IS IT AVAILABLE IN DIFFERENT 
LANGUAGES 
YES WHATEVER THE LANGUAGES PARENTS SPEAK NATURALLY AND IT'S 
SIMPLE AND CHEAP IT'S LESS THAN ONE 
PER PUPIL PER YEAR 
HOW DOES IT 
WORK 
IN THE OLD DAYS YOU'D GO IN WORK AND SIGN IN AND THE SCHOOL 
SECRETARY WOULD CHECK IT AND WHEN 
EVERYONE WAS IN CLASS THEY'D CHECK 
TO SEE IF THE PUPIL WAS THERE OR 
NOT AND THEN MAKE A PHONE CALL 
BUT NOW WITH THIS SYSTEM WHICH WE 
ARE TESTING WITH THE SCHOOLS AND 
WE WANT TO TEST IT WITH THE MISSING 
PERSONS CHARITIES AND THEY WILL 
TELL US WHAT THEY NEED AND 
IMMEDIATELY A KID IS NOT IN THE 
SCHOOL IT PICKS IT UP AND TEXTS OR 
EXMAILS THE PARENTS 
THEY BOTH 
SOUND FANTASTIC SYSTEMS THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH FOR COMING IN IF YOU ONE 
ANY INFORMATION DO GET IN TOUCH 
WITH US 
MISSING.LIVE AT B. B. C. DOT CO DOT U. K. MISSINGLIVE AT B. B. C. DOT CO DOT U. K.. WE RETURN TO THE STORY OF ALEX 
MORRIS AND A REUNION THAT TOOK FOUR 
YEARS TO HOP 
HAPPEN 
THE MORRIS FAMILY IS FROM BERKSHIRE 
BORN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO ALEX IS THE YOUNGEST 
OF THREE AND HIS BEST FRIEND WAS 
ALWAYS HIS DAD BRIAN 
BUT SIX YEARS AGO ALEX'S DAD 
SUDDENLY DIED 
HEART BROKEN ALEX BEGINS TO 
WITHDRAW FROM THE FAMILY AND AFTER 
A ROW ON THE PHONE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE HE 
REFUSES TO COME TO A FAMILY 
CHRISTMAS 
IT WAS ABOUT A MONTH OR CHRISTMAS TWO MONTHS LATER AND MY MUM SAID 
SHE HADN'T HEARD NOTHING FROM HEM 
AND SHE TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH 
HIM 
AND GOT NOTHING BACK L. TRIED AND I GOT NO REPLY BACK SO THAT 
STARTED PANICKING ME AND WORRYING 
MY MUM 
WE JUST THOUGHT HE WAS 
BEING IGNORANT AND NOT ANSWERING 
CALLS OR LETTERS OR ANYTHING LIKE 
THAT SO I JUST LEFT IT AND GOT 
MORE ANGRY AND ANGRY ABOUT IT 
BECAUSE I COULD SEE MY MOTHER 
SUFFERING AND I COULDN'T SEE IF 
HE SAYS HE LOVED HIS MUM THAT HE 
COULD PUT HIS MUM THROUGH THAT SORT 
OF THING AND IT MADE ME ANGRY 
AFTER WEEKS OF SILENCE THE FAMILY 
FINDS OUT THAT ALEX HAS MOVED OUT 
OF HIS HOUSE THEY CALL HIS MOBILE 
BUT HE DOESN'T ANSWER ALTHOUGH 
ALEX IS MISSING THE FAMILY IS 
RELUCTANT TO WASTE POLICE TIME 
THEY STILL BELIEVE ALEX WILL COME 
HOME ANY DAY 
THE MONTHS PASSED ON 
AND ON AND IT GOT TO THE STAGE 
WHERE I WAS WORRIED BECAUSE I 
DIDN'T KNOW IF HE WAS DEAD OR ALIVE 
IT WAS AS THOUGH YOUR LIFE HAD GONE 
YOU FELT EMPTY BECAUSE YOU KNOW 
THAT ONE OF YOUR CHILDREN HAS GONE 
MISSING AND IT'S REALLY HARD I I TRIED LOOKING FOR HIM BUT L. 
DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING L. DIDN'T KNOW 
HOW TO LOOK FOR HIM L. DIDN'T KNOW 
WHO TO GO TO AND EVEN THINKING 
THAT HE'D GONE TO MY DAD'S GRAVE 
AND EVEN LEAVING LETTERS THERE FOR 
HIM TO READ SAYING WE MISS HIM AND 
WANT HIM BACK AND LOVE HIM AND TO 
KNOW HE ONE SAFE AND WELL BUT IT WAS 
REALLY DIFFICULT LOSING MY DAD AND 
THINKING I'D LOST HIM AS WELL FOUR FOUR YEARS GO BY THERE IS NOT A WORD 
FROM ALEX 
IN JANUARY LAST YEAR BARRY FINALLY 
DECIDES TO CONTACT MISSING PEOPLE 
TO SEE IF THEY CAN HELP TRACE HIS 
BROTHER 
SEVERAL MONTHS WENT BY AND BROTHER I'D HAD THE ODD PHONE CALL AND I'D 
PHONE THEM UP AND THEY HADN'T 
FOUND HIM OR THEY SAID THEY MIGHT 
HAVE FOUND HIM BUT IT WAS THE 
WRONG PERSON 
IT'S A DISAPPOINTMENT 
FOR THE FAMILY BUT BEFORE LONG 
MISSING PEOPLE IS IN TOUCH AGAIN I I THINK IT WAS A MONTH OR SOMETHING 
LATER MY MUM SAYS THEY THINK 
THEY'VE FOUND HIM AND I ASKED 
WHERE BUT THEY SAID THEY WOULDN'T 
GIVE THE ADDRESS THEY JUST KNOW 
HIS WHEREABOUTS AND THEY'RE GOING 
TO SEE IF HE ONE O. K. 
ALEX'S FAMILY 
HAVE TO WAIT FOR HIM TO MAKE 
CONTACT AND THEN LAST SEPTEMBER 
HIS MUM FINALLY GETS A CALL 
ALL OF 
A SUDDEN MY PHONE WENT AND IT WAS 
HELLO MUM I WANT ED TO CRY BUT 
I COULDN'T CRY 
IT FELT A MASSIVE 
RELIEF TO HAVE MY BROTHER BACK L. 
REMEMBER HIM AS A LITTLE KID 
RUNNING AROUND IN HIS NAPPY 
RUNNING AROUND AFTER ME ALL THE 
TIME WANTING TO PLAY 
WHEN HE 
FINALLY CAME ON TO THE PHONE I 
CRIED MY EYES OUT AND ALL I KEPT 
SAYING WAS I THOUGHT YOU WERE 
DEAD I HAD TO HEAR HIS VOICE FOR 
REAL TO KNOW IT WAS HIM 
THERE ARE 
SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ALEX AND WHERE 
HE HAS BEEN BUT ONE THING IS CLEAR 
HE IS READY TO RE BUILD HIS 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PEOPLE WHO 
LOVE HIM AND I'M DELIGHTED TO SAY 
THAT ALEX IS WITH US NOW ALONG 
WITH HIS SISTER MAGGIE AND IT IS 
EVENLY EMOTIONAL MAGGIE WATCHING 
THAT FILM AND REMEMBERING THAT 
PHONE CALL

ME AND I LOVE THEM BACK AND GROW 
UP WITH THEM AND REKINDLE 
EVERYTHING 
WHY DID YOU MAKE THAT DECISION NOT 
TO BE IN TOUCH WITH THEM NOT TO

DEATH OF MY FATHER WAS TRAUMATIC 
FOR ME L. COULDN'T DEAL WITH THAT 
AT ALL 
BEING IN A MARRIAGE THAT WASN'T 
SUCCESSFUL ALSO HEARING A LOT OF 
RUMOURS SURROUNDING THE FACT THAT

SEEM PARENTS LOVE THEIR KIDS NO 
MATTER WHAT 
I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE THEM TO 
GET IN CONTACT AND TRY AND REBUILD 
WHAT THEY HAVE HAD MISSING FOR AS 
LONG AS THEY HAVE BEEN MISSING 
YEAH I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE THEM 
TO DO THAT 
I APPRECIATE YOU COMING TO SEE US 
TODAY ALEX AND MAGGIE YOUR MUM IS 
UPSTAIRS SO HELLO TO HER 
ON THE PROGRAMME WE HAVE HAD CALL 
AS WELL ABOUT NADIA 
IT HAS BEEN SEVEN MONTHS SINCE 
KEVIN AND GLENYS GOSDEN'S SON 
PLANNED HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND HE 
HASN'T COME BACK FOURTEEN YEAR OLD 
ANDREW GOSDEN IS FROM DONCASTER AND 
ON THE FOURTEENTH SEPTEMBER LAST YEAR HE 
DIDN'T GO TO SCHOOL HE BOUGHT A 
ONE WAY TICKET AND CAUGHT A TRAIN 
TO LONDON A MONTH LATER HIS 
PARENTS KEVIN AND GLENYS MAKE THEIR 
OWN TRIP TO THE CAPITAL TO FOLLOW 
UP POTENTIAL SIGHTINGS 
THERE WAS ONE SIGHTING WHERE 
SOMEBODY HAD SEEN THEM WHEN THEY 
WERE PICKING UP THEIR KIDS FROM 
SCHOOL SCHOOL BUT THERE IS NO NEWS 
THEY ARE ABOUT TO GET THE CHANCE TO 
APPEAL FOR HELP LIVE ON BREAKFAST 
TELEVISION TELEVISION IT IS ESTIMATED THAT AS MANY AS 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN GO MISSING EVERY 
YEAR ANDREW GOSDEN IS ONE SUCH BOY 
THE PRESSURE IS STARTING TO SHOW 
FOR ANDREW'S PARENTS THE SEARCH 
SEEMS ENDLESS 
IT IS A CHANCE TO STRESS TO THE 
PUBLIC THAT TO ACT IMMEDIATELY IF 
THEY THINK THEY HAVE SEEN HIM IN 
THE STREET 
WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF 
INTERVIEWS AND IT IS REPETITIVE 
YOU START WONDERING WHICH BITS HAVE 
I LEFT IN HAVE I MISSED ANYTHING 
IMPORTANT WE HAVE GOT THE HELPLINE 
NUMBER ON THE SCREEN AT THE END AND 
I THINK THAT'S REALLY USEFUL 
WHAT KEVIN DOESN'T KNOW IS THAT 
BACK IN SOUTH YORKSHIRE A CALL HAS 
COME IN THAT COULD GIVE THE POLICE 
A BREAKTHROUGH IN THEIR 
INVESTIGATION INVESTIGATION THERE IS LADY SAYING SHE HAS 
RECENTLY BEEN AROUND THIS AREA WHEN 
SHE HAS SEEN YOUNG LAD WHO SHE 
THINKS COULD BE ANDREW WHO 
MATCHES THE DESCRIPTION OF ANDREW 
WE ARE HERE TO SPEAK TO HER AND GET 
HER TO SHOW US WHERE SHE SAW THIS 
YOUNG MAN 
A WOMAN WORKING IN CENTRAL LONDON 
THINKS SHE SAW ANDREW IN COVENT 
GARDEN ON SEVENTEENTH OCTOBER MONTH 
AFTER HE WENT MISSING 
WHAT DID YOU DO 
I SAID EXCUSE ME 
DO YOU LIVE IN LONDON I PROBABLY 
SAID THE WRONG THING L. SAID YOU 
LOOK LIKE A BOY ON T. V. WHO IS MISS 
MISSING AND HE HE SAID NO IT IS 
NOT ME L. SAID IS THAT THE QUESTION 
YOU WANTED TO ASK HE SAID IS THAT 
YOUR ONLY QUESTION I SAID YEAH 
THIS IS THEIR BEST LEAD SO FAR THE 
WOMAN TAKES THE OFFICERS TO THE 
STREET WHERE SHE THINKS SHE SAW 
ANDREW ANDREW THIS IS WHERE PHILIPPA STOPPED AND 
SPOKE TO HIM AND THIS IS WHERE SHE 
ENGAGED HIM IN CONVERSATION IF WE 
MAKE NOTE OF THIS WE CAN SEE THE 
BUILDING ITSELF HAS C. C. T. V. CAMERAS 
OUTSIDE SO THAT'S QUITE GOOD 
POINT FOR US 
IF THEY CAN GET THE FOOTAGE FROM 
THE OFFICE'S C. C. T. V. IT COULD AN AN 
FIRM IT IS CON CONFIRM IT IS 
ANDREW ANDREW THEY DO HAVE C. C. T. V. BUT IT WASN'T 
WORKING WORKING WITHOUT THE FOOTAGE IT IS 
IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW IF IT REALLY IS 
HIM HIM BUT COULD OTHER PEOPLE IN THE AREA 
HAVE SEEN ANDREW 
AND THIS WAS AS FAR AS YOU GOT O. K. O. K. YOU WERE AT THIS END OF THE 
JUNCTION WHEN YOU LOST SIGHT OF HIM 
WHEN YOU LOST SIGHT OF HIM YOU 
HAVE COME DOWN HERE AND THOUGHT 
WELL WHERE HAS HE GONE A FRIEND 
HAS GONE INSIDE THE CAFE TO SEE IF 
HE IS IN THERE AND THAT'S THE LAST 
THAT YOU SAW OF HIM 
YES YES IF ANDREW IS IN THE AREA HE COULD 
HAVE VISITED THIS CAFE THERE IS A 
CHANCE CHANCE SOMEONE MAY RECOGNISE 
HIS PHOTOGRAPH 
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS AT ALL ON THE I I HAVE TO SAY THIS FACE LOOKS 
FAMILIAR TO ME ALTHOUGH IT IS A 
TYPICAL FACE TYPICAL TRENDY 
HAIRCUT IT MIGHT OF BEEN SOMEBODY 
LOOKING LIKE THIS BOY BUT IF THIS 
IS THE PERSON I MOOT OF SEEN 
SOMEBODY LOOKING LIKE HIM WITH TWO 
GIRLS GIRLS RIGHT RIGHT WAS THE BOY WHO CAME INTO THE CAFE 
WITH TWO GIRLS ANDREW 
THEY CAN'T BE SURE 
AND FROM HERE THE TRAIL GOES COLD 
WE KNOW THAT THE LAST SIGHTING 
POSITIVE SIGHTING OF ANDREW WAS IN 
LONDON BUT WHAT WE CAN'T CONFIRM 
IS THAT HE IS STILL STILL THERE 
IT IS OVER SIX MONTHS SINCE ANDREW 
GOSDEN DISAPPEARED HIS PARENTS 
NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM
