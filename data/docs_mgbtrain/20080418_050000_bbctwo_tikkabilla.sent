ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED

IT'S THE 
ROUND WINDOW 
THIS FOREST IS A LONG WAY FROM WHERE WE LIVE 
IT'S FULL OF REALLY TALL TREES 
I WONDER IF ANY ANIMALS LIVE IN THEM 
THERE'S SOMETHING MOVING UP THERE 
IT'S A GIBBON 
AND GIBBONS ARE A TYPE OF APE 
THAT LIVE UP IN THE TREETOPS 
AND THIS IS THEIR HOME SO THEY HAVE TO BE GOOD CLIMBERS TO LIVE HERE 
THEY HAVE LONG ARMS WHICH THEY USE TO SWING THROUGH THE TREES 
IF THEY COME TO A GAP BETWEEN THE TREES 
THEY'RE GREAT AT JUMPING TOO 
HERE'S ANOTHER ANIMAL WHICH JUMPS AND HOPS AROUND IN TREES 
IT'S A TREE FROG 
AND TREE FROGS HAVE FLAT TOES TO HELP THEM STICK ONTO LEAVES 
THIS INTERESTING LOOKING ANIMAL LIVES UP IN THE TREE ALL THE TIME 
IT'S CALLED A SLOTH 
IT HAS LONG CLAWS TO HOLD ONTO THE BRANCHES 
AND IT MOVES VERY SLOWLY 
AND CAREFULLY 
TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T FALL FROM THE TREETOPS 
MOST TREES HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF ANIMALS LIVING ON THEM 
HAVE YOU EVER LOOKED CLOSELY AT A TREE NEAR YOU 
THIS OAK TREE HAS LOTS OF INSECTS LIVING ON IT 
WHICH LIKE TO MUNCH THROUGH ITS JUICY LEAVES 
AND THERE ARE OTHER ANIMALS LIVING ON THIS OAK TREE AS WELL 
THIS SQUIRREL LIVES IN ITS HOLLOW TRUNK 
IT KNOWS THAT THERE WILL BE LOTS OF ACORNS TO EAT IN THE AUTUMN 
SO IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO LIVE 
SO NEXT TIME YOU LOOK AT A TREE 
PERHAPS YOU'LL SEE ANIMAL LIVING IN OR ON IT 
THERE ARE LOTS OF ANIMALS THAT LIVE IN TREES 
I LIKED THE GIBBONS BEST 
WHO CLIMBED AND SWUNG THROUGH THE TREES 
SHALL WE PRETEND TO SWING LIKE GIBBONS ARE YOU READY 
SWING ALONG WITH ME WHEE

SO THE CLOCK SAYS IT'S A QUARTER PAST FIVE 
BUT WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE TIKKABILLA CLOCK
