NO ONE KNOWS WHO MADE IT OR WHY 
BUT IT OFFERS A UNIQUE WINDOW ONTO LIFE AT THE HEIGHT OF THE MIDDLE AGES 
IN THIS SERIES I'LL BE USING IT TO TRAVEL THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF BRITAIN 
TODAY THE GOUGH MAP TAKES ME WEST 
I'M HEADING TO SAINT DAVID'S IN WALES 
FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF COUNTLESS PILGRIMS 
AND THE HUGE ARMIES OF EDWARD I 
I'LL UNCOVER THE SECRETS OF A MEDIEVAL ARMS RACE 
AND FIND OUT WHAT THE WELSH CASTLES CAN TELL US 
ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF THE MAP ITSELF 
THE GOUGH MAP DRAWN AROUND ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SHOWS MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED SETTLEMENTS 
ALMOST TWO HUNDRED RIVERS AND ABOUT THREE THOUSAND MILES OF ROUTES SHOWN IN RED 
IT IS BREATHTAKING IN ITS DETAIL 
BUT TO MODERN EYES IT LOOKS RATHER STRANGE 
THE GOUGH MAP HAS BRITAIN ON ITS SIDE 
IT'S ENTIRELY NATURAL THAT THE MAKERS OF THE GOUGH MAP WOULD HAVE 
ORIENTATED IT NOT NORTH SOUTH LIKE WE'RE USED TO SEEING WITH MAPS 
BUT FACING EAST TOWARDS JERUSALEM 
MUCH LIKE THIS AND EVERY OTHER CHRISTIAN CHURCH 
BECAUSE JERUSALEM WAS THE MOST SACRED CHRISTIAN CITY AND INDEED THE CAPITAL OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD 
ITS VERY LAYOUT SHOWS US THAT MEDIEVAL BRITONS PERCEIVED THE WORLD THROUGH THEIR RELIGION 
THE FAITHFUL WOULD SHOW THEIR DEVOTION BY GOING ON PILGRIMAGES 
AND SAINT DAVID'S IN WALES 
WAS ONE OF THE MOST SACRED DESTINATIONS IN BRITAIN 
THE ROUTE TO SAINT DAVID'S STARTS IN GLOUCESTER 
IT WAS THE GATEWAY TO WALES AND IS THE STARTING POINT FOR MY JOURNEY 
IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THIS BEAUTIFUL CATHEDRAL WAS JUST AN ABBEY 
BUT UNLIKE SO MANY OTHERS IT'S CLEARLY MARKED ON THE MAP 
THIS IS ONE OF THE FINEST EXAMPLES OF GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE 
AND ITS CROWNING GLORY IS THIS STAINED GLASS WINDOW WHICH IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST IN EUROPE 
BUT MOST OF THIS WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN BUILT 
WERE IT NOT FOR A SUPPOSED MURDER AND NOT JUST ANY MURDER BUT ONE OF THE MOST SORDID IN ENGLISH HISTORY 
THE ONLY THING IS SOME HISTORIANS ARE STARTING TO ASK 
WHETHER THERE WAS A MURDER AT ALL 
OR WAS IT A HOAX OF ROYAL PROPORTIONS 
AT THE CENTRE OF THIS INTRIGUE LIES EDWARD THE SECOND 
UNLIKE HIS FATHER EDWARD I 
HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST INEFFECTIVE AND UNPOPULAR MONARCHS IN ENGLISH HISTORY 
SO UNPOPULAR THAT HE WAS OVERTHROWN IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN BY HIS OWN WIFE AND HER LOVER 
AND THEN IMPRISONED IN NEARBY BERKELEY CASTLE 
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT REMAINS A MYSTERY 
FOR CENTURIES THE ACCEPTED VERSION IS THAT THE DEPOSED KING DIED 
AN HORRIFIC DEATH SODOMISED WITH A RED HOT POKER 
RUMOURS BEGAN TO SPREAD THAT HE HADN'T BEEN KILLED AT ALL AND HAD ACTUALLY ESCAPED TO IRELAND 
BUT THERE WAS A BODY AT BERKELEY CASTLE 
HOWEVER IT WAS WRAPPED IN EMBALMING CLOTHS SO NO ONE COULD SEE ITS FACE 
YET THIS BODY WAS SOON WIDELY ACCEPTED TO BE THE CADAVER OF THE EX KING EDWARD THE SECOND 
BUT THE QUESTION AROSE WHAT TO DO WITH IT 
IT WAS THEN THAT THE ABBOTS HERE AT GLOUCESTER 
REALISED THAT THIS WAS A CHANCE TO PUT THEIR ABBEY ON THE MAP 
THEY AGREED TO BURY THE BODY HERE AND TO BUILD A BEAUTIFUL TOMB 
IT WAS AN INSPIRED MOVE A KING'S TOMB MEANT PILGRIMS 
AND PILGRIMS MEANT MONEY AND PRESTIGE FOR THE ABBEY 
THE BODY WAS BROUGHT HERE FOR THE FUNERAL A LAVISH AFFAIR 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CAME TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS AND THE COFFIN REMAINED IN PLACE FOR TWO MONTHS 
RECORDS TELL OF ENORMOUS OAKEN BARRIERS THAT WERE ERECTED IN ORDER TO KEEP THE CROWDS AT BAY 
TO THIS DAY THE TOMB HAS LOST NONE OF ITS IMPACT 
THIS PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE TAKEN AS A PORTRAIT OF EDWARD IN THE MODERN SENSE OF THE TERM 
IT'S MORE LIKE AN IDEALISED IMAGE OF THE WAY THAT HE WOULD LOOK AS HE ENTERED INTO PARADISE 
BACK IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY 
DETAILS ON THE EFFIGY WOULD HAVE BEEN PICKED OUT IN COLOUR 
AND YOU CAN STILL SEE SOME TRACES OF GOLD LEAF ON HIS HAIR AND BEARD AND GEMSTONES 
EITHER REAL OR PASTE WOULD HAVE BEEN FIXED INTO THE HOLES ON HIS CROWN HERE 
DESPITE THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING THE DEATH PILGRIMS FLOCKED TO SEE THE TOMB 
THE PROCEEDS TRANSFORMED THE ENTIRE EAST END OF THE BUILDING 
THE ABBOTS' PLAN HAD PAID OFF 
IF EDWARD WASN'T MURDERED THEN WHO IS IN THAT TOMB WE'LL PROBABLY NEVER KNOW 
BUT ACCORDING TO ONE CONTROVERSIAL SOURCE 
EDWARD THE SECOND MURDERED THE PORTER AS HE ESCAPED FROM BERKELEY CASTLE 
COULD IT BE THAT THIS BEAUTIFUL CATHEDRAL WAS BUILT IN HONOUR OF A DEAD DOORMAN 
IN THE MIDDLE AGES WHEN PILGRIMS HEADED WEST OUT OF GLOUCESTER 
THEY SOON ENTERED A WILD NO MAN'S LAND 
AS THEY APPROACHED THE WELSH BORDER 
TO THE ENGLISH THE WELSH WERE A DANGEROUS AND BARBARIC RACE 
EVEN THE NAME WALES IS DERIVED FROM THE ANGLO SAXON WORD WALHA MEANING FOREIGNER OR STRANGER 
BUT THE PILGRIMS WERE NOT ALONE 
IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY THE BIGGEST ARMIES THIS ISLAND HAD EVER SEEN 
ALSO MARCHED INTO WALES LEAD BY EDWARD I 
THE ROUTES THEY TOOK ARE THE ONLY ONES SHOWN ON THIS PART OF THE MAP 
FIRST A ROAD ALONG THE NORTH COAST 
BUILT IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE TO SUPPLY EDWARD'S CASTLES AND SECOND 
THE ROUTE I'M ON THROUGH SOUTH WALES 
REPRESENTS THE PATH HIS ARMIES TOOK TO SUPPRESS AN UPRISING IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
HISTORIANS BELIEVE THESE ROUTES ARE SHOWN BECAUSE THE GOUGH MAP IS BASED 
ON AN EARLIER MAP MADE FOR EDWARD I HIMSELF 
EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS AGO THIS WAS THE BUFFER ZONE BETWEEN ENGLAND AND WALES 
AS THE ENGLISH SOUGHT TO CONQUER THE WELSH 
TO THIS DAY UP AND DOWN THIS BORDER REGION PECULIAR LAWS AND CUSTOMS SURVIVE 
THERE IS EVEN ONE THAT STIPULATES THAT SHOULD A WELSHMAN COME INTO THE TOWN UNINVITED 
YOU CAN SHOOT HIM DEAD WITH A BOW AND ARROW 
ERIC BOOL USES A BOW AND ARROWS IDENTICAL TO THOSE USED BY EDWARD I.'S ARCHERS 
AT THE TIME ARROW TECHNOLOGY WAS BEING TRANSFORMED RAPIDLY 
AS ARROWHEADS OR BODKINS COMPETED IN A DEADLY ARMS RACE AGAINST THE CHAIN MAIL ARMOUR OF THE DAY 
THAT'S THE EARLIEST TYPE OF ARMOUR PIERCING ARROWHEAD 
IT'S WHAT'S CALLED A SHORT BODKIN 
AND LIKE ALL OTHER ARMOUR PIERCING HEADS 
IT'S ESSENTIALLY A TRIANGULAR SECTION 
AS THE ARMOURERS GOT CLEVERER THEY MADE THE MAIL CLOSER LINKED 
AND MULTIPLE LINKED THE MAIL TO TRY AND MAKE THE GAPS BETWEEN SMALLER 
SO THE SHORT BODKIN ESSENTIALLY TURNS INTO THE LONG ONE THE NEEDLE BODKIN 
WHICH AS YOU CAN SEE IS GOING TO SLIDE BETWEEN THOSE LINKS VERY VERY EASILY 
AND THAT HEAD STAYS IN USE RIGHT UP INTO THE EARLY YEARS OF PLATE ARMOUR 
EVENTUALLY THAT TURNS INTO THE FINAL DEVELOPMENT THE BALLISTA BODKIN 
AND THE SECRET OF THAT HEAD IS THAT IT'S ONLY GOT TO PIERCE A QUARTER OF AN INCH OR SO 
AND YOU'VE GOT A HOLE BIGGER THAN THE SHAFT THAT THE WHOLE SHAFT PASSES THROUGH 
IT NEEDS SOME POWER BEHIND IT THOUGH IT DOESN'T FEEL VERY SHARP 
WAR BOWS ARE VERY POWERFUL BUT IT'S STILL QUITE A FINE POINT 
AND ALL THE KINETIC ENERGY IMPARTED IN IT BY THE BOW IS CONCENTRATED AT THAT ONE POINT 
O. K. ALIXE IF YOU'D LIKE TO PICK UP THE ARROW PUT IT INTO THE BOW AS I SHOWED YOU THAT'S RIGHT 
IS IT THERE GOOD O. K. AND THAT'S ON AND THEN 
GOD IT'S REALLY HARD HARD ON THE WRIST AS MUCH AS ON THE SHOULDERS O. K. 
WHEN YOU'RE READY LET HER GO 
OH WELL WE CAN'T ALWAYS HIT WHAT WE AIM 
IT WENT A WAYS YES YEAH 
OW TIGHT BACK 
AND LET IT GO WELL DONE 
O. K. OH 
THAT WAS POOR OH 
DRAW RIGHT BACK AS FAR AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN OH IT'S REALLY HARD 
WHEN YOU'RE READY LET HER GO 
HEY WELL DONE YEAH NICE SHOT 
I ACTUALLY HIT THE TARGET ABSOLUTELY 
SO OBVIOUSLY I'M A NATURAL AT THIS BUT HOW MUCH PRACTICE WOULD A MEDIEVAL LONGBOWMAN HAVE GOT 
A LOT OF PRACTICE WHEN YOU WERE FIVE YEARS OLD YOUR FATHER WAS COMPELLED TO BUY YOU A BOW AND ARROWS 
AND YOU WERE REQUIRED TO PRACTISE EVERY SUNDAY AND FEAST DAY 
SO BY THE TIME YOU WERE FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN 
YOU WERE CAPABLE OF SHOOTING THESE BIG ONE HUNDRED FIFTY POUND PLUS WAR BOWS 
ARCHERS TRANSFORMED THE ART OF WARFARE 
FIVE THOUSAND ARCHERS LAUNCHING AT LEAST TEN ARROWS A MINUTE 
WOULD MEAN THAT IN A WELL COORDINATED ATTACK 
AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ARROWS COULD BE LAUNCHED INTO THE SKY WITHIN THE SPACE OF ABOUT FIVE MINUTES 
THEIR ARROWS WOULD DARKEN THE SKIES 
OBLITERATING THEIR ENEMIES BEFORE THEY'D EVEN HAD A CHANCE TO DRAW THEIR SWORDS 
IT WAS MEDIEVAL SHOCK AND AWE TACTICS THAT EVENTUALLY SAW ENGLAND 
BECOME ONE OF THE MOST FEARED NATIONS IN EUROPE 
IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY ENGLAND HAD ITS EYE ON WALES 
AT THE TIME WALES HAD A POPULATION OF LITTLE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
AND MUCH OF THE COUNTRY WAS DENSE FOREST 
SO AT THE VANGUARD OF EDWARD I.'S INVADING ARMIES 
WERE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED WOODCUTTERS THEIR JOB WAS TO BREAK A TRAIL THROUGH THE WELSH HINTERLAND 
BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER ROUTE INTO WALES BY WATER 
FOR TRADERS AND MERCHANTS RIVERS LIKE THE SEVERN BECAME THE SUPER HIGHWAYS OF THEIR AGE 
THE GOUGH MAP SHOWS THE RIVER SEVERN OR THE SEVERN SEA AS IT WAS KNOWN 
AS A SWEEPING WATERWAY POURING INTO THE HEART OF BRITAIN 
ITS OVERSIZED SCALE ON THE MAP HIGHLIGHTS ITS SIGNIFICANCE 
I'VE COME TO NEWPORT TO CROSS THE RIVER USK A TRIBUTARY OF THE SEVERN 
NEWPORT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PORTS 
SHIPS CAME HER FROM ALL OVER BRITAIN AND INDEED FROM ACROSS EUROPE 
EVIDENCE OF THE SHIPPING TRADE WAS FOUND HERE IN THE MUDDY BANKS OF THE RIVER USK IN TWO THOUSAND TWO 
A HUGE MEDIEVAL SHIP 
MOST SHIPS OF THE TIME ENDED THEIR DAYS EITHER WRECKED OR TAKEN APART FOR SCRAP 
SO THIS WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL FIND 
IT'S BEING KEPT IN THIS WAREHOUSE WHERE IT'S UNDERGOING A LENGTHY CONSERVATION TREATMENT 
SO HOW OLD IS THIS SHIP WHEN WAS IT MADE 
WE DON'T KNOW BUT WHILE WE WERE CLEANING IT 
WE FOUND A VERY INTERESTING CLUE 
WHICH IS THIS THING DOWN HERE 
SITTING IN THIS HOLE HERE 
BURIED IN THE KEEL 
IT'S A COIN THAT WAS MINTED IN FRANCE BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FIVE AND ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY SIX 
SO THIS SHIP CAN'T BE ANY OLDER THAN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FIVE EXACTLY 
SO WHY DO YOU THINK THEY EMBEDDED THIS COIN IN THE HULL OF THEIR SHIP 
IT'S GOOD LUCK I KNOW SHIP BUILDERS EVEN NOW 
WHO PUT COINS UNDER MASTS WHEN THEY BUILD A SHIP 
IT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF HOW BIG IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
YES IT WAS TWENTY SIX METRES IN LENGTH 
THAT WAS HOW MUCH WE FOUND ON THE EXCAVATION 
IT'S PROBABLY LONGER MORE LIKE THIRTY FIVE 
WOW SO IT'S A REALLY BIG SHIP 
MORE CLUES ABOUT LIFE ON THE NEWPORT SHIP WERE FOUND BURIED WITHIN IT 
WHAT WE'VE GOT ARE FRAGMENTS OF SOMETHING CALLED MERIDA WARE 
WHICH IS POTTERY ONLY MADE IN PORTUGAL AND THE IBERIAN PENINSULA 
WHICH SUGGESTED SHE'S BEEN WORKING ON THE CONTINENT 
RATHER THAN THE SEVERN ESTUARY FOR A GREAT DEAL OF HER WORKING LIFE 
THIS IS ONE OF THESE CLASSICAL MEDIEVAL SHOES 
WHAT A SPLENDID SHOE WITH A POINTED POINTED TOE 
AND IT WAS STUFFED WITH MOSS THE TOE WAS STUFFED WITH MOSS WHEN WE FOUND IT IT'S BEEN SEWN TOGETHER 
IT WOULD CURL UP LIKE THAT SO IT'S A REAL PANTOMIME SHOE 
A FIFTEENTH CENTURY WINKLE PICKER AS I DESCRIBE IT YEAH 
BUT TRADING BY SEA WAS NOT WITHOUT RISK 
GOING UP AND DOWN THE SEVERN ESTUARY THERE WERE A LOT OF BARBARY PIRATES WORKING THE DEVON COAST 
SO IF YOU WENT OUT ON A SHIP YOU STOOD A CHANCE OF GETTING SEIZED SO YOU WERE CAREFUL 
THIS IS A STONE SHOT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED FROM A LITTLE CANNON 
IT DOESN'T FEEL THAT HEAVY LIKE IT COULD DO A LOT OF DAMAGE 
YOU FIRED AT A MAST TO BRING IT DOWN OR IT WOULD CERTAINLY GO THROUGH A SAIL 
OTHER EVIDENCE OF WARFARE BESIDES THIS STONE SHOT 
IS THIS LEATHER ARCHER'S WRIST BRACER 
WHICH WOULD GO AGAINST THE INSIDE OF THE LEFT WRIST LIKE THAT 
TO PROTECT HIM WHEN HE'S FIRING FROM GETTING STRUCK BY THE STRING OF THE BOW RIGHT 
IT ALSO SHOWS THAT THE PEOPLE ON THIS SHIP WERE ARMED AND DANGEROUS 
THE CONTENTS OF THE HULL AND THE SHIP'S ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TIMBERS 
ARE TESTAMENT TO THE SIZE OF THE BOAT 
AND TO THE IMPORTANCE OF SHIPPING IN MEDIEVAL BRITAIN 
RIGHT NOW 
I'M OFF TO A PLACE THAT THE GOUGH MAP CALLS PLAGA DICTA GLAMORGAN 
A PLACE CALLED GLAMORGAN 
FOR MEDIEVAL PILGRIMS IT WOULD BE A FURTHER FIVE DAY WALK TO SAINT DAVID'S 
ALONG THE WAY THEY'D HAVE FOUND RESPITE IN MANY OF THE SMALL 
UNNAMED SETTLEMENTS THAT APPEAR ON THE GOUGH MAP 
HERE IN COSMESTON IS A MODERN RECREATION OF A MEDIEVAL VILLAGE 
BUILT RIGHT ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF A MEDIEVAL SETTLEMENT 
THIS PLACE GIVES US EXTRAORDINARY INSIGHT INTO HOW MEDIEVAL WELSH PEASANTS WOULD HAVE LIVED 
TODAY COSMESTON HAS BEEN RE BUILT TO LOOK PRETTY MUCH LIKE IT LOOKED IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY 
ALL THESE HOUSES ARE BUILT UPON THE FOUNDATIONS 
OF THE ORIGINAL BUILDINGS AND GIVE AN ACCURATE REFLECTION 
OF THE LAYOUT OF A SMALL WELSH MEDIEVAL VILLAGE 
THIS IS THE KIND OF HOUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OWNED BY PEASANTS AT THE VERY TOP OF THE HEAP 
LIVING IN RELATIVE COMFORT IN A PLACE LIKE THIS 
BUT EVEN SO IT'S PRETTY SMOKY COS THERE'S NO CHIMNEY HERE 
SMOKE FROM THE FIRE SIMPLY ESCAPES THROUGH A SMALL GAP IN THE THATCH UP ABOVE 
ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT COSMESTON WAS INTEGRATED 
NOT JUST INTO THE NATIONAL ECONOMY 
BUT INTO THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY AS WELL 
THEY FOUND FRAGMENTS OF SAINTONGE EARTHENWARE WHICH COMES FROM THE SOUTH WEST OF FRANCE 
AND ALSO COINS WHICH INDICATE THAT A CASH ECONOMY WAS IN OPERATION HERE 
EVEN IN A TINY VILLAGE LIKE COSMESTON 
ONE OF THEIR LOVELIEST FINDS I THINK WAS THIS TINY COIN 
WHICH IS DATED FROM THE REIGN OF EDWARD I 
WORN THIN FROM BEING PASSED FROM HAND TO HAND 
IT'S A DELICATE LITTLE THING 
BUT VERY EVOCATIVE 
FROM THE PEACE OF COSMESTON I'M OFF TO SEE SOMETHING WHICH CAN BE FOUND 
ENCIRCLING WALES ON THE GOUGH MAP CASTLES 
TO SECURE HIS AUTHORITY IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX EDWARD I EMBARKED UPON 
THE GREATEST CASTLE BUILDING PROJECT EUROPE HAD EVER SEEN 
KNOWN AS THE RING OF IRON 
HIS CASTLES SURROUNDED SNOWDONIA THE SEAT OF WELSH RESISTANCE 
BUT I AM VISITING WHAT IS ARGUABLY THE GREATEST CASTLE OF THEM ALL 
CAERPHILLY 
THIS WAS THE ULTIMATE STATEMENT OF POWER 
CAERPHILLY REVOLUTIONISED CASTLE DESIGN IN BRITAIN 
THESE HUGE LAKES TAKE UP ABOUT THIRTY ACRES OF THE SITE 
AND THEY HELP TO KEEP POTENTIAL ATTACKERS AT BAY 
THIS IS THE LARGEST CASTLE IN WALES 
AND NOT ONLY IS IT VAST IT'S ALSO VIRTUALLY IMPREGNABLE 
AS A NUMBER OF WELSH ARMIES DISCOVERED TO THEIR COST 
CAERPHILLY WAS ONE OF THE FIRST CONCENTRICALLY DESIGNED CASTLES IN BRITAIN 
BASICALLY ONE CASTLE BUILT INSIDE ANOTHER 
AND IF ATTACKERS WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET THROUGH THIS GATEHOUSE 
THEY WOULD HAVE A HORRIBLE SENSE OF DEJA VU WHEN THEY SAW THAT ON THE FAR SIDE WAS THE SAME AGAIN 
IN RESPONSE TO THE STRENGTH OF CASTLES LIKE CAERPHILLY SIEGE ENGINES WERE DEVELOPED 
PITTING ENGINEERING GENIUS AGAINST ARCHITECTURAL MIGHT 
THEY HAD NAMES LIKE GOD'S OWN CATAPULT THE WARWOLF 
AND MY PERSONAL FAVOURITE THE BAD NEIGHBOUR 
SOMETIMES IN AN EFFORT TO DEMORALISE THEIR ENEMIES 
BESIEGERS WOULD STRIKE SOME PRETTY LOW BLOWS 
AT ONE SIEGE ON BOHEMIA TWO THOUSAND CARTLOADS OF MANURE WERE SENT OVER A CASTLE WAR BY TREBUCHET 
AT ANOTHER SIEGE IN FRANCE A PAGEBOY WAS SENT OUT OF A CASTLE WITH A MESSAGE 
AND WAS RETURNED TO SENDER VIA CATAPULT 
ACCORDING TO ONE EYEWITNESS HIS FRIENDS WERE 
MUCH DISCOMFORTED AND GREATLY ASTONISHED BY HIS ARRIVAL 
HERE AT CAERPHILLY IS A REPLICA OF A SMALL SIEGE ENGINE 
SO PAUL WHAT KIND OF SIEGE MACHINE IS THIS 
THEY WERE KNOWN AS MANGONELS IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
IT'S A TORSION MACHINE IT USES POWER STORED IN TWISTED ROPE TO GIVE IT POWER 
IS IT THE SAME KIND OF MACHINE PEOPLE USED IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY 
YES AND FROM THE GREEK PERIODS UP TO THAT POINT AS WELL 
AND HOW FAR CAN IT FIRE MISSILES 
OURS DOES ABOUT A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY METRES SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WHAT ARE THEY MADE OF JUST STONES 
STONES GENERALLY THE SMALLER MACHINES JUST FIRED NICE ROUND ROCKS 
ONCE YOU GET BIGGER THEY GET STONEMASONS IN TO CHIP ROUND BALLS 
THEY KNEW ABOUT AERODYNAMICS AND KNEW THAT NICE ROUND STONES WENT 
A LOT BETTER THAN ODD SHAPED ROCKS THAT HAD BEEN LYING ABOUT SURE 
SO PAUL HOW DO YOU FIRE THIS THING 
YOU CAN'T FIRE THEM BECAUSE FIRE IS SOMETHING THAT COMES IN WITH CANNONS MUCH LATER 
SO WE USE THE WORD LOOSE SET IT LOOSE WHICH COMES FROM A GERMAN WORD LOSEN MEANING TO SHOOT 
SO CAN I PULL THE TRIGGER AS IT WERE 
IF YOU SHOUT LOOSE MY ASSISTANT WILL PULL THE TRIGGER 
CLEARS THROAT LOOSE 
OOH 
ALTHOUGH LARGER SIEGE ENGINES DEVASTATED OTHER CASTLES 
CAERPHILLY'S WALLS WERE NEVER BREACHED 
IT SYMBOLISED ENGLISH DOMINANCE OVER THE WELSH 
BUT ODDLY CAERPHILLY DOES NOT APPEAR ON THE GOUGH MAP 
CAERPHILLY WAS BUILT BY A LOCAL ENGLISH BARON NOT EDWARD I 
THIS OMISSION IS FURTHER EVIDENCE ALONG WITH THE ROUTES TAKEN BY EDWARD'S ARMIES 
THAT THE GOUGH MAP WAS MADE TO PLEASE A ROYAL PATRON 
AND THIS PATRON WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY EDWARD I.'S GRANDSON EDWARD THE THIRD 
WHO WAS ON THE THRONE WHEN THE GOUGH MAP WAS DRAWN IN THE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTIES 
I'M CONTINUING ALONG THE SOUTH COAST OF WALES 
THE CLOSER I GET TO SAINT DAVID'S THE MORE THE IMPORTANCE OF PILGRIMAGE 
TO THIS REGION'S HISTORY BECOMES CLEAR 
THERE WAS EVEN A LATIN RHYME ROMA SEMEL QUANTUM BIS DAT MENEVIA TANTUM 
ONCE TO ROME IS WORTH TWICE TO SAINT DAVID'S 
NO WONDER THEY CAME IN THEIR THOUSANDS 
FROM KINGS OF ENGLAND TO ORDINARY MEN AND WOMAN 
ALL COMING TO ATONE FOR THEIR SINS 
HERE AT NEVERN JUST A FEW MILES AWAY FROM SAINT DAVID'S 
PILGRIMS ON ROUTE THERE CARVED FROM THE ROCKS THIS CROSS 
YOU CAN SEE THAT PILGRIMS TO THIS DAY 
SEEM TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS TO IT QUITE LITERALLY 
BY STICKING LITTLE COINS INTO THE CRACKS IN THE FACE OF THE ROCK 
PILGRIMS ALSO CARVED OUT 
A NICHE DOWN HERE THAT THEY COULD KNEEL INTO AS THEY GAZED UP AT IT 
WALKING THROUGH THE FOREST AND SEEING THE ISOLATED CROSS AT NEVERN 
I GOT A SENSE OF WHAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIKE FOR THE PILGRIMS 
WHO HAD BEEN DRAWN TO THIS PEACEFUL PLACE TO PRAY 
I'VE FINALLY MADE IT TO SAINT DAVID'S 
THIS IS THE MOST WESTERLY POINT IN WALES ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILES FROM GLOUCESTER 
IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MEDIEVAL PILGRIMS ALMOST TWO WEEKS TO MAKE THIS LONG AND ARDUOUS JOURNEY 
SAINT DAVID'S COULDN'T BE FURTHER AWAY FROM ENGLAND 
BUT WHAT THE PILGRIMS WOULD HAVE FOUND WHEN THEY GOT HERE 
MIGHT HAVE SURPRISED THEM BECAUSE SAINT DAVID'S WAS ONE OF THE MOST ANGLICISED PARTS OF WALES 
AND THAT WAS JUST HOW THE ENGLISH WANTED IT 
BUT THEY DIDN'T GO ABOUT TRYING TO CONQUER THIS REGION USING CASTLES AND SIEGE MACHINES ALONE 
SAINT DAVID'S WAS AT THE CENTRE OF A STRUGGLE FOR HEARTS AND MINDS 
THIS BATTLE CRYSTALLISED AROUND ONE MAN 
GIRALDUS CAMBRENSIS OR GERALD OF WALES 
SAINT DAVID'S WAS THE KEYSTONE IN THE ENGLISH MISSION TO ANGLICISE WESTERN WALES 
AND USURP THE POWER OF THE WELSH CHURCH 
NATURALLY THEY NEEDED A BISHOP 
AND GERALD OF WALES BRILLIANT SCHOLAR EMINENT MEMBER OF THE WELSH CHURCH 
AND THE MAN WHO HAD OVERSEEN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS CATHEDRAL WAS THE OBVIOUS CANDIDATE 
BUT GERALD WAS TURNED DOWN FOR THE JOB NOT ONCE BUT TWICE 
WHY WELL HE HAD WELSH BLOOD AND TO BE BISHOP HERE THAT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
YOUR LOYALTY TO THE ENGLISH CAUSE HAD TO BE UNAMBIGUOUS 
CENTURIES LATER THIS SNUB TO GERALD STILL RANKLED 
HERE IN THIS MODERN SCULPTURE THE BISHOP'S MITRE IS SHOWN NOT ON GERALD'S HEAD 
BUT BY HIS FEET UNWORN 
WALES WAS EFFECTIVELY ANNEXED BY EDWARD IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR 
TRADITIONAL WELSH REGIONS WERE TURNED INTO ENGLISH SHIRES 
AND ENGLISH LAW SUPERSEDED WELSH 
THE ENGLISH SEEMED TO BE IN CHARGE 
BUT THE GOUGH MAP TELLS A VERY DIFFERENT AND REVEALING STORY 
THERE'S VERY LITTLE INFORMATION HERE THE WELSH HINTERLAND IS BARELY MAPPED AT ALL 
BECAUSE EVEN BY THE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTIES WHEN THE GOUGH MAP WAS MADE 
MUCH OF WALES WAS STILL A NO GO ZONE FOR THE ENGLISH 
FAR AWAY FROM THE ENGLISH CASTLES AND CATHEDRALS 
THE DREAM OF AN INDEPENDENT WALES STILL LIVED ON
