MANY YEARS HE WENT TO SHELTER 
TWICE WEEK PEOPLE FROM THE 
SHELTER WHO HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY NOT 
SEEN HIM FOR SUCH LONG PERIOD OF 
TIME DECIDED TO REPORT HIM MISSING

THEM THAT HAVE GIVEN YOU THE 
PICTURE OF THEM WE KNOW A LITTLE 
BIT ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND 
HE'S A 
REALLY QUITE INTELLIGENT MAN HE 
STUDIED ASTROLOGY OBVIOUSLY HE 
HAS CHOSEN HIS LIFE BUT PEOPLE DO 
CARE ENOUGH THAT THEY STILL WANT TO

PEOPLE THAT FIND THEMSELVES 
HOMELESS UNFORTUNATELY GET INTO 
DRINK AND DRUGS WE UNDERSTAND THAT

INDICATION HE MAY BE IN THE 
FINSBURY PARK AREA DOWN THERE

INQUIRY 
WE HAD A GOOD RESPONSE INQUIRY FROM THE APPEAL WE HAD A NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE PHONING FROM THE ISLE OF 
SHEPPEY WE WENT DOWN TO THE ISLE 
OF SHEPPEY AND VISITED LOCATIONS 
DOWN THERE 
IT MUST BE DIFFICULT 
WHEN CHILDREN ARE INVOLVED 
IT CAN 
BE EMOTIONAL WE HAVE BEEN 
FORTUNATE ON THIS OCCASION INASMUCH 
AS NADIA'S MOTHER IS TAKING GREAT 
CARE OF THE CHILDREN THAT IS ONE 
LESS WORRY FOR US 
OF COURSE BEST 
OF LUCK WITH BOTH OF THOSE APPEALS 
THEY'RE TWINS THEY HAVE SO MUCH IN 
COMMON BUT WHY HAVE THEIR LIVES 
TURNED OUT SO DIFFERENTLY 
LIVERPOOL HAS BEEN HOME FOR THE 
MORRELL FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS 
JAMES MORRELL AND HIS THREE 
BROTHERS ARE FROM WALTON VALE IN 
THE NORTH OF THE CITY 
A VERY HAPPY UPBRINGING FOUR 
BROTHERS TOGETHER PLAYING OUT IN 
THE STREETS ON THE FIELDS MY 
OVERRIDING MEMORIES ARE OF 
HAPPINESS REALLY 
JAMES IS ESPECIALLY CLOSE TO HIS 
TWIN BROTHER JOHN 
WE USED TO PLAY FOOTBALL DO NORMAL 
THINGS WE STAYED IN THE SAME 
CIRCLE OF FRIENDS WE DID QUITE A 
BIT TOGETHER EVEN UP TO AGE EIGHTEEN OR 
TWENTY WE PRETTY MUCH STAYED TOGETHER 
GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO 
JAMES STARTS WORK IN LIVERPOOL AS A 
LAB TECHNICIAN 
BY NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE HE'S READY TO SETTLE DOWN 
JAMES MET HIS WIFE JANUARY IS IN 
HIS EARLY TWENTIES THEY GOT MARRIED AND 
GOT A HOUSE IN CROSS BY SOME YEARS 
LATER THEY HAD A LITTLE GIRL 
KENDAL AND THEN A BIT LATER ON 
THEY HAD ANOTHER LITTLE GIRL 
GEORGIA GEORGIA AN INCREDIBLY PROUD FATHER WHO WAS 
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE FUTURE I 
THOUGHT LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE HIS 
CHILDREN GROW AND MATURE AND BECOME 
ADULTS AND SHARE A LIFE WITH HIM 
THE NINETIES ARE A HAPPY TIME FOR 
JAMES BUT HE FINDS IT DIFFICULT 
AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS MOTHER IN 
NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AND HIS FATHER FOUR YEARS 
LATER LATER IT 
AFFECT YOU WHEN YOU LOSE 
SOMEONE IN YOUR FAMILY BUT JAMES 
I KNOW AND MYSELF HE SEEMED TO 
PULL THROUGH SO WE THOUGHT 
IN THE 
YEARS THAT FOLLOW JAMES APPEARS TO 
BE COPING BUT PRIVATELY THE LOSS OF 
HIS PARENTS AFFECTS HIM DEEPLY 
HE BECAME DEPRESSED HE DIDN'T 
REALLY SOCIALISE HE WOULD GO OUT 
FOR A COUPLE OF PINTS AT THE PUB ON 
HIS OWN THAT WOULD BE ABOUT IT HE 
SEEMED QUITE STRANGE HE SEEMED 
FORGETFUL HE WASN'T AS WELL KEPT 
AS HE USED TO BE

JAMES' RELATIONSHIP AND IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
THE COUPLE AGREE THEY NEED TIME 
APART APART WHEN JAMES AND JANUARY IS SPLIT UP

LIFE LIFE JAMES'S STATE OF MIND IS REALLY 
FRAGILE ON SUNDAY THIRD JULY TWO THOUSAND FIVE

UNIT AS A HOSPITAL JUST A FEW MILES 
FROM HIS HOME THE FAMILY REALLY 
HOPE HE WILL GET THE TREATMENT HE 
NEEDS NEEDS WHILE HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL WE 
WAITED UNTIL WE SAW THE DOCTORS AND 
WE ASKED THEM NOT TO LET HIM OUT 
UNTIL HE WOULD BE ASSESSED WHICH 
THEY SAID THEY WOULD DO 
WHILE EVERYONE WAITS FOR JAMES'S 
CONDITION TO BE PROPERLY DIAGNOSED 
EVENTS SUDDENLY TAKE AN UNEXPECTED 
TURN TURN I THINK HE WAS VERY UNWELL AT THAT 
POINT IN TIME THINGS HAD 
DETERIORATED RAPIDLY DON'T THINK 
MANY PEOPLE APPRECIATED HOW BAD 
THINGS HAD BECOME FOR HIM 
AT SEVEN HUNDRED I GOT PHONE CALL TO SAY 
THAT JAMES HAD RUN OUT OF THE 
HOSPITAL LAUGHING HE HAD JUST HIS

KNOW PEOPLE ARE O. K. WHEN BOB MORTON 
TRIED TO FIND HIS BROTHER NEIL HE 
TURNED TO THE SALVATION ARMY BUT 
HIS SEARCH DIDN'T GO AS PLANNED 
BOB IS HERE WITH HIS NIECE SALLY 
AND MAJOR GRAHAM KINSLEY TELL US 
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER NEIL YOU LOST 
CONTACT SOMETIME AGO 
WE LOST 
CONTACT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AFTER O. OUR MOTHER 
DIE OUR MOTHERED DIED NEIL 
WORKED ABROAD QUITE A LOT AND WE 
JUST SLOWLY DRIFTED APART 
BE U. 
WITH YOU HAD BEEN CLOSE WHEN YOU 
WERE YOUNG 
WE HAD BEEN FAIRLY 
CLOSE BUT NOT REALLY IN EACH 
OTHER'S POCKETS WE HAD DIFFERENT 
INTERESTS HE WAS BRAINY ONE I HAD 
TO STUG STRUGGLE BUT WE NEVER 
FELL OUT WE NEVER HAD ANY 
DISAGREEMENTS WE JUST DRIFTED 
APART AND WENT OUR SEPARATE WAYS 
AND WHEN WE WANTED TO TO GET IN 
TOUCH WITH EACH OTHER OF COURSE WE 
FAILED TO MAKE CONTACT AND BACK IN 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A FAIRLY 
SERIOUS HEART CONDITION AND WAS 
TOLD I HAD TO HAVE A MAJOR 
OPERATION AND I THOUGHT WELL I 
MAY OR MAY NOT COME THROUGH THIS 
AND I WOULD LIKE TO TRY AND FIND 
NEIL BEFORE I HAVE THE OPERATION 
GOSH SO THAT 
WAS TWENTY EIGHT YEARS LATER IT IT WAS TWENTY EIGHT YEARS LATER 
LET US ASK 
SALLY WHO IS YOUR NIECE WHAT 
HAPPENED 
UNFORTUNATELY MY FATHER HAPPENED DIED RECENTLY WE GOT A LETTER 
THROUGH THE POST AND I WAS AT HOME 
AND MY MOTHER SAID IT IS ADDRESSED 
TO MY FA SHER AND FATHER AND SHE 
DIDN'T WANT TO READ IT AND IT WAS 
FROM THE SALVATION ARMY SAYING 
YOUR BROTHER IS TRYING TO TRACE YOU 
SO I HAD THE UNFORTUNATE TASK OF 
THE PHONING UP BOB WHO I HADN'T 
SEEN FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEAR TO SAY YOU 
KNOW WITH HAVE GOT YOUR LETTER BUT 
DAD DIED FOUR DAYS BEFORE WE 
RECEIVED IT 
SO BOB THAT IS A 
SOME PHONE CALL TO TAKE JOUR NIECE 
PHONES YOU AND TELLS YOU YOU HAVE 
JUST MISSED YOUR BROTHER 
THAT IS 
RIGHT YES WE WERE JUST WE WERE 
AWAY ON HOLIDAY AND WE WERE LEAVING 
TO COME HOME AND WE HAD THE 
TELEPHONE CALL JUST AS WE WERE 
GETTING INTO THE CAR AND WE HEARD 
THE NEWS THAT NEIL HAS DIED AND 
THAT WAS THE QUIETEST JOURNEY HOPE 
I HAVE HAD L. DON'T THINK WE SPOKE 
TO EACH OTHER ON THE WAY HOME AT 
ALL AND THAT WAS ABOUT THREE HOURS 
THEN IT HIT US AND WE WERE 
FORTUNATELY WE WERE ABLE TO GO TO 
THE MEMORIAL SERVICE THAT DOWN IN 
CAMBRIDGE AND THEN WE WERE REUNITED 
WITH SALLY AND NEIL'S WIFE AND A 
LOT OF FRIENDS WE HAD NOT SEEN FOR 
MANY MANY YEARS 
SO BOB AND YOUR 
DAD ARE THEY VERY ALIKE 
THEY HAVE 
THE SAME HAIR STYLE THEY ARE A BIT 
FOLICALLY CHALLENGED MY FATHER 
ALWAYS HAD A BEARD BUT THERE IS 
SOME MANNERISMS AND THE WAY THEY 
ARE SORT OF LIKE MOUTH AND CHIN 
ARE QUITE SIMILAR SO YES I MEAN 
WHEN I SAW HIM DRAW UP FOR THE 
FUNERAL I INSTANTLY RECOGNISED HIM 
EVEN THOUGH I HADN'T SEEN HIM FOR 
TWENTY EIGHT YEARS 
BRIEFLY SO OTHER PEOPLE 
WHO WANT TO GET IN TOUCH THEY CAN 
USE YOUR SERVICES 
THAT'S CORRECT 
HOW DOES IT WORK 
THE SALVATION 
ARMY HAS HAD THE FAMILY TRACING 
SERVICE FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY YEARS NOW AND 
WE HAVE BUILT UP QUITE A LEVEL OF 
CONFIDENCE CONFIDENTIALITY AND 
TRUST FROM A LOT OF AREAS SO WE DO 
SOMETIMES USE TRUSTED THIRD PARTIES 
SOMETIMES THE ELECTORAL ROLL AND WE 
JUST TAKE ON A CASE AND SEE WHAT 
WE CAN DO AND IN BOB'S CASE WEER 
WITH FORTUNATE BUT A BIT TOO LATE 
UNFORTUNATELY 
SO BOB AND SALLY IF UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WATCHING US 
TODAY WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ABOUT IF 
THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT GETTING IN 
TOUCH WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM 
DO IT NOW 
DON'T WAIT 
IT HAS 
CHANGED YOUR LIFE 
YES IT HAS

TO THE CASE OF THE MISSING TWIN 
CAN HIS BROTHER JOHN FIND OUT WHERE 
HE WENT 
JAMES MORRELL COMES FROM A LARGE 
FAMILY IN LIVERPOOL HE MARRIES 
JANICE AND THEY HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS 
BUT THE DEATH OF HIS MOTHER IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
AND FATHER FOUR YEARS LATER DEEPLY 
AFFECTS HIM JAMES AND HIS WIFE 
SEPARATE IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND HE MOVES INTO 
A FLAT ALONE WITHOUT HIS FAMILY 
ROUND HIM HE IS IN A FRAGILE 
MENTAL STATE HE IS EVENTUALLY 
ADMITTED TO A PSYCHIATRIC UNIT AT A 
LIVERPOOL HOSPITAL ON JULY THIRD TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
BUT TWO DAYS LATER WHILE HE IS 
WAITING FOR TREATMENT JAMES RUNS 
OUT OF THE HOSPITAL IN HIS PYJAMAS 
AND DISAPPEARS KNOWING HE IS 
EXTREMELY VULNERABLE LIVERPOOL 
POLICE MAKE THE SEARCH FOR JAMES A 
PRIORITY 
HE WAS CLASSED AS A HIGH PRIORITY RISK PATIENT BECAUSE HE WAS MISSING 
FROM THE HOSPITAL AND HIS CURRENT 
MENTAL HEALTH STATE THAT WE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN VERY CONCERNED AND ALSO 
THE FACT HE WAS WEARING PYJAMAS OUT 
YES IT WAS SUMMER BUT EVEN SO HE 
WAS CLASSED AS A HIGH RISK SO WE 
DID A LOT OF SEARCHING JOHN JOHN MORRELL IS STILL HAUNTED BY WHAT 
HAPPENED TO HIS BROTHER NEARLY 
THREE YEARS AGO HE REGULARLY 
VISITS THE AREA ROUND THE HOSPITAL 
TRYING TO RETRACE JAMES' STEPS 
STILL COME THIS WAY WHEN I AM 
DRIVING OFTEN SO I GO PAST THIS 
HOSPITAL QUITE LOT WITH 
OBVIOUSLY BRINGS MEMORIES BACK 
WHICH OBVIOUSLY BRINGS MEMORIES 
BACK SO TO SPEAK THIS IS THE 
SPWRABS TA ENTRANCE THAT JAMES 
LEFT THE HOSPITAL ON ON THE DAY HE 
ACTUALLY VANISHED AS YOU CAN SEE 
IT IS QUITE BUSY MAIN ROAD IT IS 
A MAIN ROUTE THROUGH TO LIVERPOOL 
JAMES ACTUALLY CAME OUT THIS 
ENTRANCE AND HE WALKED STRAIGHT 
DOWN TOWARDS WALTON WEAL WHICH IS 
WHERE HE WAS BROUGHT UP IT IS 
LITERALLY MILE AWAY VALE 
POLICE RECORDS SHOW THAT JAMES MADE 
A NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE CALL FROM THIS PHONE BOX AT 
THREE POINT THREE ONE ON THE AFTERNOON OF HIS 
DISAPPEARANCE WHAT HE SAYS REVEALS 
HE WAS CONFUSED AND DISORIENTATED 
FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON THERE WAS 
POLICE HELICOPTER IN THE AREA AND 
JAMES BELIEVED HE W. IT WAS WATCHING 
HIM AND FOLLOWING HIM SO HE WENT TO 
THE PHONE BOX AND PHONED THE POLICE 
TO ASK THEM WHY HE WAS BEING 
FOLLOWED BY THE POLICE HELICOPTER 
THIS IS THE LAST PLACE THAT WAS 
KNOWN FOR JAMES TO BE AFTER THAT 
HIS WHEREABOUTS NO ONE SEEMS TO 
KNOW 
MERSEYSIDE POLICE USE ALL KNOW RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM TO TRY 
AND TRACK DOWN THE FOUR YEAR OLD 
SEARCH OF THE AREA WAS DONE LOOKING 
FOR SOMEBODY WITH JAMES' 
DESCRIPTION JAMES HAD 
CAR SO HIS CAR WAS CHECKED TO SEE WHERE THAT 
WAS HE HADN'T USED THAT THEN WE 
CHECK IN TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY 
MOVEMENT ON BANK ACCOUNTS TO MAKE 
SURE HIS BENEFIT HAS BEEN PAID IN 
TO SEE IF HE HAS DRAWN ANY MONEY 
OUT TO SEE IF THERE ANY OTHER 
SIGHTINGS 
TWO YEARS ON IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
THE POLICE LAUNCH ANOTHER SEARCH TO 
TRY AND DISCOVER WHAT HAPPENED TO 
HIM WHEN HE LEFT THE HOSPITAL 
THESE MAPS DOWNLOADED FROM A 
WEBSITE HAVE AERIAL VIEWS OF THE 
AREA WHERE JAMES WAS LAST SEEN 
THAT AREA THERE IS THE HOSPITAL 
IT'S VERY VERY DENSELY POPULATED 
WITH TREES THAT'S THE AREA WE GOT 
THE GREATER MANCHESTER POLICE'S 
DOGS IN YOU CAN SEE THE EXTENT OF 
THE SEARCH AREA IT TOOK THEM ALL 
WEEK THEY HAD THE BRIEFING ON THE 
MONDAY AND THEY FINISHED ON THE 
FRIDAY UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS A 
NEGATIVE SEARCH 
THE SEARCH BY HIGHLY TRAINED POLICE 
DOGS FINALLY ELIMINATES THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT JAMES IS STILL IN 
THE AREA AROUND THE HOSPITAL 
THE MORRELL FAMILY STILL HOPE ONE 
DAY JAMES WILL COME BACK INTO THEIR 
LIVES LIVES YOU DON'T REALISE HOW EASY IT IS 
FOR SOMEONE TO GO MISSING UNTIL IT 
HAPPENS TO YOUR FAMILY 
AND THEN IT IS QUITE DEVASTATING 
IT'S BEEN DEVASTATING FOR HIS WIFE 
AND HIS CHILDREN AND YOU KNOW 
WHEN YOU START THINKING THAT THERE 
ARE TWO YOUNG CHILDREN THERE WHO 
DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR 
FATHER IT'S PERHAPS ONE OF THE 
MOST WORRYING ASPECTS OF IT ALL WE 
NEED CLOSURE ON THIS IF HE'S O. K. 
EVEN IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE FOUND 
IF HE GETS IN TOUCH TO SAY HE'S O. K. 
THERE'S NOT A DAY GOES BY I DON'T 
THINK ABOUT HIM YOU KEEP ON HOPING 
THAT HE IS OUT THERE

OF THE SEARCH FOR JAMES IS ON THE 
PHONE NOW GOOD MORNING WHAT 
SIGHTINGS HAVE THERE BEEN ON HIM 
THERE WERE ACTUALLY TWO SIGHTINGS 
OF JAMES THE DAY HE WENT MISSING 
ONE OF THOSE WAS BY STAFF A MALE 
FITTING HIS DESCRIPTION WAS SEEN 
RUNNING THROUGH THE HOSPITAL 
KITCHENS KITCHENS AT AROUND FIVE O'CLOCK THE SAME DAY 
THERE WAS SIGHTING BY AN 
ANONYMOUS PERSON WHO SAW MAN 
FITTING THE DESCRIPTION IN 
LIVERPOOL 
DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO LIVERPOOL CONTACT YOU WHO SAW A PERSON ON 
THAT DAY 
IT WAS AN ANONYMOUS CALL 
TO SAY THEY HAD SEEN JAMES IN 
LONGMORE LANE WE NEED MORE 
INFORMATION 
WHAT KIND OF CHECKS INFORMATION HAVE YOU MADE ON HIS BANK ACCOUNTS 
WE HAVE CHECKED HIS BANK DETAILS 
HIS BANK ACCOUNT HAS NOT BEEN USED 
SINCE BEFORE HE WENT INTO HOSPITAL 
WE HAVE CHECKED THAT HE IS NOT 
REGISTERED WITH A NEW DOCTOR THAT 
HE'S NOT ADMITTED TO ANY OTHER 
HOSPITALS HE'S NOT RECEIVING 
BENEFIT IT'S HE DIDN'T HAVE 
PHONE WITH HIM SO THAT WASN'T 
WORTH CHECKING BUT WE DO ACTUALLY 
HAVE HIS PASSPORT BUT WE HAVE MADE 
CHECKS TO MAKE SURE HE HASN'T 
REGISTERED FOR NEW PASSPORT WE 
DO BELIEVE THAT HE IS STILL IN THE 
U. K. U. K. I KNOW YOU HAVE DONE A NUMBER OF 
DIFFERENT SEARCHES THIS HAS BEEN 
SOME TIME NOW HOW HAVE THOSE GONE 
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO 
WE HAVE DONE NUMBER OF SEARCHES 
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT WE DON'T KNOW 
WHERE ELSE TO LOOK BECAUSE HE 
WASN'T IN A RATIONALE STATE OF MIND 
AND HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS ERRATIC IF IF ANYBODY KNOWS WHERE HE IS HOW MUCH 
WOULD A CALL HELP YOU IN YOUR 
INVESTIGATION 
IT WOULD BE A HUGE INVESTIGATION HELP TO THE INQUIRY AND ALSO TO THE 
FAMILY WE NEED TO LET THE FAMILY 
KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO JAMES 
SARAH MARSHALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
IF YOU CAN HELP IN THE SEARCH FOR 
JAMES PLEASE CALL MISSING PEOPLE 
NUMBER IS OH FIVE OH OH SEVEN HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED 
THE SEARCH FOR JAMES USED 
HELICOPTERS AND DOGS THERE IS 
NEW PIECE OF CUTTING EDGE 
TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD HELP THE 
UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE OR UAV 
THIS IS HOW IT WORKS 
WE ARE SETTING YOU UP THE M. D. FORTY TWO HUNDRED 
THE NEWEST UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE 
UAV THIS TIME IT'S A MANUAL FLIGHT 
BUT IT CAN BE FULLY AUTOMATIC 
WE'RE CURRENTLY ONE HUNDRED METRES 
OFF THE GROUND WE ARE GETTING A 
VIEW DOWN ACROSS THE VILLAGE 
IT'S THE PLAN IS TO SIMULATE A 
RECOVERY OF A PERSON OR A BODY FROM 
A HEDGE ROW WE ARE USING A THERMAL 
IMAGING CAMERA THE FIRST OF ITS 
TYPE IT'S A HIGH RESOLUTION WE 
WILL HEAD DOWN TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED METRES 
DOWN THE HEDGE ROW AND YOU WILL 
HOPEFULLY PICK ME OUT 
THE MAN WHO KNOWS HOW THIS PIECE OF 
KIT COULD HAVE MADE DIFFERENCE IS 
ALISTAIR FOX GOOD MORNING GOOD GOOD MORNING 
I WAS IN THE METROPOLITAN MORNING POLICE FOR A FEW YEARS AND DEALT 
WITH A LOT OF MISSING PEOPLE AND 
NEVER USED ANYTHING LIKE THIS HOW 
DOES IT WORK 
IT'S AN UNMANNED 
AERIAL VEHICLE IT'S BEEN IN 
DEVELOPMENT IN GERMANY ORIGINALLY 
CONTRIVED FOR THE GERMAN MILITARY 
SEVERAL YEARS AGO IT'S NOW BEEN 
BOUGHT BY POLICE FORCES AND THE 
FIRE BRIGADE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS 
HOW DOES IT WORK 
SUBJECT TO RULES AND REGULATIONS 
THE URBAN USE FOR THE EQUIPMENT YOU 
CAN ACTUALLY LOCATE IT FROM A PHONE 
BOX FOR INSTANCE A KNOWN G. P. S. 
POSITION AND SET TO FLY TO CIRCLE 
AN AREA 
YOU MENTION G. P. S. IS THAT 
THE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS IN THIS 
THING 
YES A MIXTURE OF GIRO THING SCOPES BUT PREDOMINANTLY THE G. P. S. 
FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT 
IS WHAT IS IT 
GLOBAL POSITIONING 
SATELLITE IS LIKE A SAT NAV IN A 
CAR IT WILL ENABLE THE OUTERS TO 
PRE PROGRAMME THE ROUTE YOU CAN 
FLY IT MANUALLY BUT INCREASINGLY 
WE ARE DISCOVERING FOR SEARCH AND 
RESCUE OPERATIONS PRE PROGRAMMING 
A FIELD TO VIEW YOU CAN GO AND 
COVER A VAST AREA AUTONOMOUSLY WE WE HAVE SEEN JAMES'S CASE THERE HOW 
COULD THAT HAVE BEEN USED 
IN THAT 
INSTANCE THE BEAUTY OF THIS OVER 
THE HELICOPTER IS THE RAPID 
RESPONSE WITHIN A COUPLE OF 
MINUTES OF THAT PHONE CALL THERE 
COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY ON SITE AT 
THAT PHONE BOX AND SENT THIS 
EQUIPMENT UP TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY METRES ABOVE 
THE SEA COVERING A GOOD SQUARE MILE 
WITHIN FIVE MINUTES YOU WOULD GET 
AN AERIAL VIEW WHICH IS QUICKER 
THAN THE HELICOPTER 
THAT IS SAVING 
TIME BUT PRESUMABLY IT SAVES 
MONEY 
YES IT COSTS FOR A YEAR MONEY WHAT IT COSTS TO RUN A HELICOPTER 
FOR AN HOUR IT GIVES THE GUYS ON 
THE GROUND THE ABILITY TO GET THAT 
VIEW THEY WOULD NORMALLY HAVE TO 
RELY ON A THIRD PARTY 
WHAT SORT OF 
IMAGES DO YOU GET 
THERE IS A 
COLOUR CAMERA THIS IS A LITTLE 
HEAD BUT ALSO THERMAL IMAGE CAMERA 
THAT ENABLES YOU TO FIND A HEAT 
SOURCE FROM UP TO SIX HUNDRED METRES AWAY 
IN A BUSH FOR INSTANCE 
IF WE HAD 
A MISSING PERSONS INQUIRY AND 
SOMEONE WAS OUT MISSING AND THEY 
SLEPT IN A HEDGE ARE YOU SAYING 
THIS PIECE OF KIT COULD POTENTIALLY 
PICK THEM UP IN THAT ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY IT PICKS UP IMAGES THROUGH MIST 
RAIN FOG AND SMOKE MORE 
IMPORTANTLY WHAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY 
TRACE WITH THE THERMAL IMAGING 
CAMERA IS THE FOOTPRINT THAT PERSON 
HAS LEFT BEHIND IN TERMS OF SWEET 
WRAPPERS ANYTHING THAT HAS A HEAT 
SOURCE IN IT 
MERSEYSIDE ARE USING 
THIS AT THE MOMENT YES 
IT'S YES MIXTURE OF AN URBAN AREA AND 
COUNTRYSIDE AS WELL WHERE DO YOU 
SEE THIS BEING MOST EFFECTIVE WE WE ARE GETTING MORE INTEREST NOW FROM 
BRITISH TRANSPORT POLICE THEY'RE 
LOOKING AT RAILWAYS AND TRESPASS ON 
THE RAILWAY WHICH IS DANGEROUS IN 
ITS OWN RIGHT INCREASINGLY THE 
FIRE SERVICE ARE USING IT IN AN 
URBAN SEARCH AND RESCUE ENVIRONMENT 
BUT MORE SO I THINK THE POLICE ARE 
LOOKING AT THIS FOR A LONGER TERM 
RURAL ASPECT IN WHICH CASE THEY 
DON'T HAVE TO DEPLOY PEOPLE INTO 
FIELDS AND PUT THE OFFICERS AT RISK 
IN SOME RURAL AREAS THERE ARE 
PLACES WHERE OFFICERS CAN'T 
PHYSICALLY GET TO 
THAT'S RIGHT 
THE FACT THAT THIS CAN GO OUT THERE 
AND FLY IT OVER AND LOOK FOR A 
PERSON WHO IS MISSING ON THE MOORS 
FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN FIND THEM SAFE 
AND WELL IT'S GREAT HOPE IT 
TAKES OFF LITERALLY
