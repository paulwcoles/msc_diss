MY LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE PIANO STARTED IN THIS LONDON STREET 
IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES A PLAYER PIANO WAS DELIVERED TO MY GRANDPARENTS 
A PRESENT FROM MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER 
HERE MY UNCLE DAVID SHOWED ME THE BLUES 
BOOGIE WOOGIE 
HERE I REALISED THAT THE PIANO IS A MULTI VOICED ORCHESTRA AND MY FINGERS THE TEN MEMBERS OF THE BAND 
AIN'T MISBEHAVING 
I LEARNT ON ONE OF THESE A PIANOLA 
SOME WERE OPERATED BY ELECTRIC MOTORS SOME LIKE THIS WITH PEDALS 
BLOWING AIR THROUGH THE ROLLS DICTATED THE NOTES YOU COULD CHANGE THE TEMPO 
PLAY PIANISSIMO 
OR FORTE 
YOU COULD HEAR THE GREAT MASTERS IN YOUR OWN FRONT ROOM 
PEOPLE LIKE GEORGE GERSHWIN FATS WALLER WHO MADE THIS AND JAMES P. JOHNSON WOULD CUT PIANO ROLLS 
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF JAZZ HERE'S JUST A FEW 
NOBODY REALLY KNOWS EXACTLY HOW JAZZ STARTED 
BUT WHERE DID IT ALL BEGIN 
IT'S SAID THAT JAZZ GREW OUT OF A MIXTURE OF MUSICAL STYLES THAT WERE AROUND IN THE LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS IN THE U. S. A. 
PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD MET UP IN CONGO SQUARE IN NEW ORLEANS AND SHARED THEIR MUSIC 
AT THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THERE WERE MANY NEW DANCE CRAZES AND ONE OF THEM WAS THE CAKEWALK 
WITH DANCERS AND LISTENERS 
AND THEY USED TO HAVE COMPETITIONS FOR DANCERS 
AND THE ONE THEY CHOSE THE BEST DANCING COUPLE GOT A CAKE AS A PRIZE 
DANCE FOLK AND CLASSICAL MUSIC SHAPED THE STYLE KNOWN AS RAGTIME 
IF YOU SAY RAGGED TIME QUICKLY IT BECOMES RAGTIME 
SCOTT JOPLIN JOSEPH LAMB AND JAMES SCOTT WERE THE BIG THREE COMPOSERS 
A PIECE OF RAGTIME HAD SO MUCH GOING ON IT HAD TO BE PLAYED AS WRITTEN 
JAMES P. JOHNSON CAME ALONG AND SAID THIS IS BORING FOR ME 
I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING ELSE 
SO THEY DEVISED THIS STYLE CALLED HARLEM STRIDE PIANO BECAUSE IT ORIGINATED IN HARLEM 
AND STRIDE BECAUSE IF YOU WATCH ANYBODY PLAYING STRIDE PIANO 
THE LEFT HAND STRIDES BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WITH AN OOMPAH BEAT 
WILLIE THE LION SMITH WAS ONE OF THE FATHERS OF JAZZ PIANO AND A GLADIATOR WITH OTHER PIANISTS 
THEY'D OUTPLAY ONE ANOTHER IN CUTTING COMPETITIONS 
HIS NAME THE LION CAME FROM HIS HEROIC DEEDS DURING WORLD WAR ONE 
A STRIDE PIANIST PLAYS THE EXTREMES OF THE PIANO RATHER THAN THE MIDDLE WHICH RAGTIME CONCENTRATES ON 
THE LEFT HAND DOES A LOT OF VARIATIONS 
A STRIDE PIANIST WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
IN THE TWENTIES WHEN STRIDE WAS POPULAR THEY DIDN'T USE BASS PLAYERS AND DRUMMERS NORMALLY 
PLAYING STRIDE WAS A ONE MAN BAND 
LATER ON WHEN THEY STARTED USING DRUMS 
THE PIANIST'S LEFT HAND GOT LAZY 
WILLIE THE LION SMITH THRIVED IN A HARLEM EXPLODING WITH TALENT 
A PIANO MAN HAD IT MADE LIKE A HAIR CUTTING MAN OR AN UNDERTAKER 
NO MATTER WHERE YOU WENT THERE WAS WORK 
OTHER ENTERTAINERS LIKE SINGERS AND DANCERS DID NOT HAVE IT SO GOOD NOR DID DRUMMERS OR FIDDLERS 
A GOOD PIANIST DIDN'T NEED ASSISTANCE 
SO BY NOW NINETEEN TWELVE NINETEEN FOURTEEN 
THE JAZZ AGE IS ABOUT TO BE BORN 
WHERE IS THE WORD JAZZ FROM 
SOME PEOPLE SAY IT COMES FROM THE JASMINE TREE 
OTHERS FROM THE NAME JAZZBO BROWN 
SOME SAY IT'S A SEXY TYPE OF GOINGS ON 
BUT THERE WAS A PERFUME CALLED JASS TAKEN FROM THE JASMINE TREE AND PROSTITUTES IN NEW ORLEANS WORE IT 
AND SO THE AGE OF JAZZ WAS BORN 
THE GREATEST STYLE OF PIANO IS THAT WHICH MOVES THE SPIRIT AND PROVOKES DANCING 
FOR ME THAT IS BOOGIE WOOGIE TO PLAY IT YOU NEED A LEFT HAND THAT IS A RHYTHM SECTION IN ITSELF 
YOU CAN THEN INVENT IMPROVISE AND RIFF WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND 
ONE TALE OF BOOGIE WOOGIE'S CREATION COMES FROM THE PIANIST EUBIE BLAKE 
HE SAYS THAT AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY 
THERE WAS A VERY FAT STRIDE PIANIST CALLED WILLIAM TURK 
AND HE COULDN'T GET HIS HAND IN FRONT OF HIS BELLY 
SO HE HAD TO DEVELOP A REPETITIVE LEFT HAND THUS BOOGIE WOOGIE WAS BORN 
I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT NONE OF US COULD 
OF COURSE ONE STYLE DOESN'T DISAPPEAR WHEN ANOTHER COMES ALONG 
AND STYLES GET MIXED TOGETHER TO MAKE SOMETHING NEW 
LET'S LOOK AT THE BLUES 
THE BLUES MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE 
FOR SOME IT'S ABOUT EXPRESSING A FEELING FOR SOME IT'S JUST A SOUND 
THE VOICE IS WONDERFULLY EXPRESSIVE AND MOST INSTRUMENTS BORROWED FROM THAT STYLE 
IT'S THE EXPRESSION WHICH WAS ACHIEVED BY BENDING NOTES 
FALLING OFF AND SLIDING UP TO NOTES 
AND EVEN USING VIBRATO 
WHICH IS WHERE THE PITCH OF THE NOTE WOBBLES A BIT 
THE GUITAR WAS ABLE TO BORROW FROM THE VOICE BY SLIDING UP THE NECK 
THIS IS HARD ON PIANO OF COURSE 
SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS CRUSH NOTES 
BLUES IS A CENTRAL FOCAL POINT OF THE MUSIC 
FOR ME IT'S SOMETHING I LIKE TO HAVE AT THE CENTRE OF WHAT I PLAY 
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE SCALE THAT IT COMES FROM 
REFERRED TO AS THE BLUES SCALE 
SO IN SOME WAYS IT'S USING SOUNDS FROM THAT BUT DOING THIS 
IS NOT THE BLUES YOU DEAL WITH THE BLUES LIKE THIS 
SO AS YOU CAN HEAR CERTAIN THINGS COME OUT THERE CERTAIN SOUNDS 
SO IT'S A SOUND THAT'S IN MY EAR BUT I'M USING IT 
IN DIFFERENT WAYS COUPLED WITH 
SOMETIMES I'M NOT STRICTLY USING THAT SCALE I GO IN AND OUT OF IT 
AND I'M FOCUSING ON THE SOULFULNESS OF THAT SOUND 
THE BLUES APPEARS IN MANY STYLES OF MUSIC 
IT'S SAID THAT HERE IN NEW ORLEANS IS WHERE JAZZ BEGAN 
THIS CITY WAS HOME TO IMMIGRANTS FROM ALL OVER EUROPE AFRICA INDIA AND THE CARIBBEAN 
AND MUSIC FROM ALL THESE PLACES WAS TO BE MIXED UP TOGETHER 
JELLY ROLL MORTON WAS A PIANIST WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE INVENTED JAZZ 
JELLY ROLL MORTON WOULD ENTER A PLACE SMILING SO EVERYONE SAW HIS DIAMOND STUDDED TOOTH 
HE WOULD TAKE OFF HIS COAT WITH A FLOURISH 
AND LAY IT ON THE PIANO WITH THE EXPENSIVE LINING OUTWARD 
THEN HE WOULD WIPE OFF THE PIANO BENCH WITH A SILK HANDKERCHIEF 
HE WOULD GLANCE AROUND TO SEE IF HE WAS GETTING THE PROPER ATTENTION 
HE'D SIT AND LIKE ALL THE PIANISTS OF HIS DAY HIT A SIGNATURE CHORD 
YOU NEEDED A SPECIAL CHORD TO START YOUR PERFORMANCES 
HE'D SAY WHEN I PLAY SOLO PIANO I TRY TO SOUND LIKE AN ORCHESTRA 
THAT'S WHY EVERYTHING'S HAPPENING IN THE LEFT HAND AND THE RIGHT 
SO MUCH GOING ON THAT IT COULD SOUND A BIT LIKE AN ORCHESTRA 
PERHAPS THE GREATEST VIRTUOSO JAZZ PIANIST OF ALL TIME IS ART TATUM 
HE COULD DO THINGS THAT NOBODY SINCE HAS BEEN ABLE TO EMULATE 
BUT HE ALSO HAD THIS ORCHESTRAL WAY OF PLAYING IMAGINATIVE HARMONY 
AND HE WOULD THROW IN A THOUSAND CHORDS IN A SMALL MUSICAL SPACE 
BUT IF YOU WERE TO ANALYSE IT IT'S ALL VERY COMPLEX STUFF 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW ONE HUMAN BEING WITH TEN FINGERS CAN DO THAT 
HE COULD DO MORE WITH HIS LEFT HAND THAN MOST PEOPLE COULD DO WITH TWO HANDS 
BY THE END OF THE NINETEEN TWENTIES THE JAZZ TRAIN SWUNG INTO THE STATION 
AS THE NINETEEN THIRTIES DAWNED BIG BANDS DEVELOPED 
SOME WERE LED BY GREAT PIANISTS SUCH AS COUNT BASIE 
BIG BANDS WERE A VERY POPULAR TIME IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC 
THE BIG BAND DERIVED FIRST BY BEING A COMBINATION OF INSTRUMENTS 
ADDED TO THE BASIC RHYTHM SECTION OF THE PIANO AND THE BASS 
AND THE GUITAR AND THE DRUMS 
AS THAT BECAME PROMINENT PEOPLE LIKE DUKE ELLINGTON ADDED HORNS 
AND THAT INCLUDES TRUMPETS TROMBONES AND SAXOPHONES 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SAY WOODWIND AND BRASS WE SAY HORNS 
OF COURSE YOU CAN SAY 
WHEN WE DO GO INTO THOSE KINDS OF TERMS WE DO REFER TO THE BRASS 
BUT WE REFER TO THE WOODWIND AS THE REEDS 
BUT BASICALLY WHEN DUKE FINALLY GOT HIS SET UP TO THE PERFECT SOUND OR THE PERFECT SIZE 
IT WAS REALLY HAVING FIVE SAXOPHONES 
TWO ALTO SAXOPHONES TWO TENOR SAXOPHONES AND ONE BARITONE SAXOPHONE 
THREE TRUMPETS THREE OR FOUR TRUMPETS 
AND SO YOU HAD JUST ONE TWO AND THREE 
AND YOU'D HAVE THREE OR FOUR TROMBONES 
AND ONE OF THOSE TROMBONES WOULD BE PERHAPS A BASS TROMBONE 
THEN YOU'D HAVE THE PIANO THE BASS AND THE DRUMS 
THE FRONT LINE IS THE HORNS AT THE FRONT THE BACK LINE THE HORNS AT THE BACK 
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE DUKE ELLINGTON'S PIANO STYLE ENERGY INCREDIBLY SOPHISTICATED HARMONY 
HE WAS REALLY INVENTIVE WITH THE HARMONY UNDERNEATH 
STARTING OFF WITH A SIMPLE THEME BUT CREATING LAYERS OF HARMONY EXACTLY 
YOU HEAR THIS TERM BEBOP BANDIED AROUND 
AND TERMS IN JAZZ CAN BE CONFUSING BEBOP WAS BORN AROUND THE FORTIES 
AND I GUESS ANY MOVEMENT OF MUSIC IF YOU'VE GOT INDIE MUSIC SAY AND ROCK AND ROLL 
THEN AROUND A GROUP OF MUSICIANS OFTEN THERE'S A COLLECTIVE FORMED 
AND ALSO USE OTHER HARMONIES 
SANDWICHED IN BETWEEN THE FORM OF THOSE CHORDS GOING BY 
SO MAYBE IF THE CHORDS ARE LIKE 
AND ALSO THEY WOULD PLAY MELODIES USING SCALES AND ALSO INVOLVING THOSE CHORD CHANGES THAT WERE ADDED 
YOU HAVE TO STICK AT IT LISTEN LISTEN LISTEN 
ONE OF JAZZ'S GREATEST NAMES IS THELONIOUS SPHERE MONK 
ONE OF THE GREAT JAZZ COMPOSERS AND PIANISTS 
HE STARTED OFF ACCOMPANYING HIS MOTHER IN CHURCH 
HE INVENTED A STYLE FOR FINGERING HIS ANGULAR CHORDS 
HISTORICALLY THELONIOUS MONK IS IN A CLASS BY HIMSELF 
I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
NOBODY'S DONE WHAT HE'S DONE 
THIS WAY WAS A DISTINCTIVE SOUND OF THE INSTRUMENT 
HE'D LIKE IT WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IT 
SOUNDS VALID 
WHEN THELONIOUS MONK CAME ALONG HE WAS REALLY 
HE WAS A MASTER OF EFFECTS 
SO USING TWO HANDS RATHER THAN 
IT WOULD SUPPORT YOUR GROOVE AND IT WAS AMAZING TO WATCH HIM PLAY 
IT WOULD SUPPORT YOUR GROOVE AND IT WAS AMAZING TO WATCH HIM PLAY 
SOME PIANISTS LIKE THELONIOUS MONK A JAZZ PIANIST 
PLAYS WITH THIS VERY STIFF FINGERED TECHNIQUE 
AS IF HE'S PLAYING SOMETHING THAT ISN'T A PIANO 
HE'S HITTING IT LIKE A DRUM SOMETIMES IT SOUNDS LIKE A XYLOPHONE 
THE REASON THEY USE THAT WORD BEBOP IS BECAUSE 
BOO BE DEE BOW DE BE BOP 
BOO DO BE DE BE DOO B. A. DE BE DOO BE BOP 
BEBOP IT'S JUST BUT WHAT IT IS MUSICALLY 
THE TRUMPET AND 
ALTO IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE IN THE FRONT LINE 
AND HAVE THEM PLAY IT IN UNISON 
AND IT'S A FAR CRY FROM 
SO I WAS SCARED OUT OF MY MIND FOR A WHILE 
SO COMPLICATED THAT STUFF 
JAZZ PLAYERS LOVE TRYING NEW THINGS 
THEY USE UNUSUAL LINE UPS OF INSTRUMENTS EXPERIMENT WITH SCALES AND CHORDS AND UNUSUAL RHYTHMS 
NOW IF SOMEBODY JUST SAYS THE TWELVE BAR TO YOU WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY SAYING IS A TWELVE BAR BLUES 
SO THEY MAY SAY TWELVE BAR TWELVE BAR BLUES OR JUST BLUES 
THE ABSOLUTE BASIC TWELVE BAR BLUES 
IS DIVIDED UP INTO FOUR BARS OF ONE CHORD THE ONE CHORD 
TWO BARS OF THE FOUR CHORD 
TWO BARS AGAIN OF THE ONE CHORD 
AND THEN ONE BAR OF THE FIVE CHORD 
ONE BAR OF THE FOUR CHORD AGAIN 
AND THEN BACK HOME TO THE ONE CHORD 
YEAH SO DOES THAT EQUAL TWELVE YET BACK TO THE ONE CHORD FOR TWO BARS 
SO IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE THIS 
TWO THREE FOUR TWO TWO THREE FOUR 
THREE TWO THREE FOUR FOUR TWO THREE FOUR 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR TWO TWO THREE FOUR 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR TWO TWO THREE FOUR 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR TWO TWO THREE FOUR 
IF YOU ADD ALL OF THE ONES AND TWOS AND THREES AND FOURS YOU GET TWELVE 
THAT'S IT THAT IS A TWELVE BAR BLUES 
THAT IS A TWELVE BAR TWELVE BAR BLUES OR BLUES 
ON TOP OF THAT WOULD FIT A HEAD WHICH JUST MEANS THE MELODY 
IF IT'S THE SAME CHORD CHANGES 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
AND THEN AFTER THE HEAD IS STATED SOMETIMES YOU'D PLAY THAT TWICE 
SO THAT WOULD EQUAL TWENTY FOUR BARS BUT IT WOULD BE TWELVE BARS TWICE NOT TWENTY FOUR BARS 
IT EQUALS TWENTY FOUR BARS BUT IT'S NOT CALLED TWENTY FOUR BARS AND THEN YOU WOULD SOLO 
YOU CAN DETERMINE HOW MANY TIMES YOU WANT TO GO ROUND THE SEQUENCE MEANING THOSE TWELVE BARS 
SONNY ROLLINS WROTE A BLUES CALLED SONNY MOON FOR TWO 
WHICH ONLY USES THOSE FIVE NOTES OF THE SCALE AND WHAT HE DID WAS WRITE A FOUR BAR PHRASE AND REPEATED IT 
SONNY MOON FOR TWO 
BUT NOT ALL JAZZ IS BASED ON TWELVE BARS 
ABDULLAH IBRAHIM A SOUTH AFRICAN JAZZ MUSICIAN OFTEN BASES HIS MUSIC ON OTHER SEQUENCES 
THIS ONE HAS A REPEATING SEVEN BAR PATTERN 
I LITERALLY STARTED AT MIDDLE C. AND JUST FOUND OUT THE CHORD OF C. 
AND IT WAS REALLY TO JUST PLAY WHOLE LOT OF SHAKING 
TO GET THAT THING AND THEN 
AND I JUST REALISED WHAT I WAS DOING WAS SPLITTING IT UP 
AND UM SO WE JUST TOOK THAT FROM C. AND THEN TO F. AND THEN TO G. THEN D. 
AND THEN IT REALLY GOT EXCITING COS YOU FOUND CHORDS YOU COULDN'T NAME 
SELF DISCOVERY TOO A JOURNEY THAT HASN'T ENDED 
WHEN I WROTE BLAME IT ON THE RAIN MY HAND SLIPPED SHOW US LIKE 
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T NEED HER YOU TOLD HER GOODBYE 
YOU SACRIFICED A GOOD LOVE TO SATISFY YOUR PRIDE 
NOW YOU WISH THAT YOU STILL HAD HER 
MY HAND SLIPPED HERE AND YOU FEEL LIKE SUCH A FOOL 
NA NA NA NA NA NA BUT IT JUST DON'T FEEL THE SAME 
YOU'RE SAYING THE CHORD WAS MADE BY ACCIDENT IT WAS A TOTAL ACCIDENT 
I WAS BORED WHEN I WAS WRITING AND MY HAND SLIPPED 
TO DO IT HALF A STEP UP I THOUGHT OOH 
IT WAS FANTASTIC IF YOU FOUND A CHORD THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW WAS THERE 
AND IN SOME WAYS I THINK IT WAS MORE EXCITING THAN BEING TAUGHT IT 
LIKE I'VE FOUND THE LOST CHORD 
I REMEMBER JIMMY TANNER WHO YOU WON'T KNOW 
NOT A BIG NAME BUT HE WAS A TREMENDOUS PIANO PLAYER 
HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SHOWING ME ALL KINDS OF THINGS YOU COULD DO WITH A PIANO 
ALL KINDS OF WEIRD LITTLE CHORDS 
YOU SEE HE SHOWED ME HOW TO MAKE SOUNDS WITH A PIANO IT JUST WAS VERY STRANGE AND DIFFERENT 
SEE IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO IDENTIFY THE CHORDS YEAH YEAH 
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL WORD HARMONY 
BUT IT MEANS THE MUSICIAN HAS SPENT TIME EXPERIMENTING WITH THE SOUND OF CHORDS 
SO IF YOU FOR INSTANCE SAY I SEE A C. SEVEN CHORD AND I PLAY THAT 
BUT A JAZZ MUSICIAN PLAYS 
HOW DO YOU KNOW TO PLAY THAT YOU MESSED AROUND WITH THE CHORDS 
UNTIL YOU FOUND SOMETHING THAT SOUNDED NICE AND THAT WORKS WITH THE SOUND THAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE 
I MEAN CHORDS HAVE ALL FUNNY NAMES 
IF I GIVE YOU A BASIC C. CHORD 
AND A NINE 
A C. THIRTEEN C. ELEVEN ACTUALLY I'LL GO THERE FIRST 
AND THE THIRTEEN 
IF ANY OF THE TENSIONS ARE REFERRED TO AS FLATTENED OR SHARPENED 
THEY'RE BASICALLY FLATTENED OR SHARPENE D. 
I CAN PLAY ALL THE FLATS AND SHARPS 
SEE HARMONY IN A NUTSHELL 
ISN'T SHE LOVELY 
IMPROVISATION IS ONE OF THE GREAT PLEASURES OF JAZZ PIANO 
UNLIKE A HORN YOU CAN ACCOMPANY YOURSELF AND PLAY HARMONIES 
NAT KING COLE IS REMEMBERED AS ONE OF THE GREAT BALLADEERS OF THE TWENTY C. 
HE STARTED OUT AS A PIANIST AND IT'S OFTEN OVERLOOKED THAT HE WAS ONE OF THE GREAT JAZZ PIANISTS 
WHEN YOU SIT AT A PIANO WHAT COMES INTO YOUR MIND OR DO YOU SWITCH OFF AND LET THE PIANO TAKE OVER 
UH SOMETIMES IF I SIT DOWN AT MY PIANO 
BEYOND THE SEA 
THINGS LIKE THAT MAY HAPPEN OF COURSE THINGS LIKE 
IT'S HARD TO SAY YOU KNOW 
HERBIE HANCOCK'S IMPROVISATIONAL STYLE HAS INSPIRED MANY PLAYERS 
MY OLDER BROTHER SAID YOU NEED TO CHECK THIS GUY OUT 
IN BETWEEN YOU COULD HEAR ALL THE 
PIANO IMPROVISATION GOING ON AROUND THE MELODY AROUND THE VOCAL MELODY 
I THOUGHT GOSH IF I COULD IMPROVISE LIKE THAT NOT THAT I KNEW HE WAS IMPROVISING 
THERE'S A LOT OF PREJUDICE TOWARDS JAZZ PIANO PLAYING 
YOU JUST MAKE IT UP BUT THERE'S LOTS OF STUDY AND CONTEMPLATION IF YOU DON'T LISTEN YOU CAN'T DO IT 
IF YOU DON'T PLAY WITH OTHER PEOPLE YOU CAN'T DO IT AS WITH ALL MUSIC 
GETTING THIS SENSE OF MOVING LEFT HAND PARTS 
CREATING IMPROVISATIONS WITHOUT IT SOUNDING TOO CLUTTERED 
AND DEVELOPING THIS KIND OF IMPLICATION OF OTHER RHYTHMS ON TOP OF A GROOVE SO YOU'VE GOT 
YOU GET THIS SENSE OF MORE THAN ONE THING HAPPENING 
BUT IT'S NOT SO COMPLEX THAT IT'S IGNORING EVERYBODY WHO'S LISTENING 
THE FIRST THING TO DO IS JUST TO JUMP IN THERE AND IMPROVISE 
PLAY SOMETHING SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
IF IT DOESN'T SEEM TO COME FROM THE TUNE OR FIT OVER THE CHORD CHANGES OR RESEMBLE ANY PART OF THE MELODY 
THEN RECONSIDER UNLESS THAT WAS YOUR INTENTION I DON'T THINK SO 
SO WITH THE STEVIE WONDER TUNE 
ISN'T SHE LOVELY 
YOU'VE GOT TO ESTABLISH WHAT THE CHORD CHANGES ARE I KNOW IT'S 
SO I KNOW THAT IT WORKS LIKE THAT 
SO I CAN APPROACH IT FROM HOW THE MELODY SOUNDS 
AS YOU CAN SEE I'M USING THE NOTES OF THE MELODY BUT ALTERING THE RHYTHM BEGINNING THE IMPROVISATION 
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO 
THAT'S PART OF THE ART OF JAZZ BECAUSE ANYONE CAN SIT DOWN AND 
YOU HEAR THAT MELODY BUT ANYONE COULD GO LIKE THIS 
THAT'S NONSENSE ISN'T IT 
I COULD MAKE SENSE OF IT BECAUSE THAT'S THE ART OF BEING A JAZZ MUSICIAN 
SO YOU CAN SHAPE IT IF YOU HAVE KNOWLEDGE 
BUT IF YOU'RE JUST PLAYING ANYTHING EVERYBODY WILL KNOW YOU'RE A FAKE 
EVERYONE WILL KNOW SO TRY AND PLAY WITHIN THE SOUND OF THE CHORDS 
IT'S MUCH BETTER IT MAKES SENSE IT HAS A VIBE TO IT AND SHOWS YOU RESPECT THE MUSIC YOU'RE PLAYING 
I ONCE THOUGHT I WANTED TO BE A CONCERT PIANIST BUT I GAVE IT UP 
I'D GET IN TROUBLE WITH MY MUSIC TEACHER BECAUSE I ALWAYS WANTED TO ADD THINGS TO THE MUSIC YEAH 
I'D BE PLAYING CHOPIN YOU KNOW 
BUT INSTEAD I'D BE DOING THINGS LIKE 
THE TEACHER WOULD SAY WHAT THAT AIN'T 
SHE COMING IN AND SLAPPING MY HAND I WOULD HAVE MADE YOU THE HEAD BOY 
HEAD OF THE SCHOOL SO 
SO THAT KIND OF ENDED MY CONCERT IDEAS 
BECAUSE I WANTED TO PLAY WHAT I FELT 
YOU KNOW WHAT CAME INTO MY 
I MEAN THE NOTES ON THE PAPER WAS FINE IT'S GOOD TO READ MUSIC I WASN'T FIGHTING THAT 
BUT I WANTED TO GO FURTHER DO MORE 
I WANTED TO SAY IF THIS IS WHAT'S WRITTEN WHAT CAN I DO WITH THIS 
I WANT TO ADD SOMETHING MAKE IT MY OWN 
WELL YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITH CLASSICAL MU S. I. C. 
IT'S REALLY JUST AN E. FLAT CHORD 
SO WHAT I DID WAS PUT THE E. UP THERE AND PUT THE FLAT DOWN THERE 
THE OTHER BIT THE G. DOWN THERE 
KIND OF A LITTLE CLASSICAL THING 
AND THEN VERY SIMPLY THAT JUST MOVES 
SO IT WAS NICE WHEN I FOUND THAT 
IT INVITES YOU TO WRITE SOMETHING OVER IT LIKE 
WHAT IT IS YOU'RE THINKING OF 
COS WHEN WE KISS 
RIGHT THROUGH THE ONE HUNDRED OR SO YEARS OF JAZZ 
MUSIC STYLES HAVE COME AND GONE ONLY TO REAPPEAR IN ANOTHER FORM A SORT OF MUSICAL RECYCLING 
TAKE GOSPEL MUSIC FOR EXAMPLE 
GOSPEL SONGS GO RIGHT BACK TO THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS 
THEY COME FROM SLAVE SONGS THAT WERE SUNG IN AMERICA'S DEEP SOUTH 
YOU CAN HEAR THEIR INFLUENCE IN JAZZ BLUES AND POP MUSIC 
WHAT'S THE ESSENCE OF GOSPEL PIANO IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN 
IT'S RHYTHMIC 
A LOT OF TIMES THEY DIDN'T HAVE DRUMS OR ANYTHING 
DO YOU THINK A LOT OF POPULAR MUSIC HAS COME OUT OF THAT CHURCH STYLE 
OH YES DEFINITELY 
MAYBE BECAUSE IT HAS SO MUCH FEELING AND EMOTION IN IT 
AND THAT'S THE BASIS OF EVERYTHING 
WITH JAZZ AND CLASSICAL MUSIC SO MUCH OF IT IS CROSS FERTILISED 
CLASSICAL MUSIC RULES IT WORKS WITHIN THE RULES OF THAT SOUND 
BUT I GUESS STYLISTICALLY 
YOU CAN 
I CAN PLAY WITH A SORT OF CLASSICAL FEEL 
D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. DUM 
JUST PLAY AROUND THE BLUES AS I WAS THERE WITH A CLASSICAL FEEL 
THERE ARE MORE SOPHISTICATED WAYS TO INCORPORATE A CLASSICAL SOUND 
USING HARMONIES THAT ARE DERIVED FROM SAY A DEBUSSY KIND OF SOUND 
MANY OF THESE CHORDS ARE DERIVED FROM PEOPLE LIKE DEBUSSY AND RAVEL 
AT SCHOOL BOYS WOULD OFTEN STEAM INTO THE MUSIC ROOM DIVE ON THE PIANO AND PLAY THINGS LIKE 
EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THAT AND I MEAN THE BASIC FORM 
THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE BLUES FORM I SHOWED YOU 
AND SO IN A LOT OF THE MUSIC THAT YOU HEAR 
WE'RE HAVING AN ELVIS PRESLEY FEST AT THE MOMENT AND I GUESS THAT IS TIMELESS AND WILL ALWAYS HAPPEN 
BUT A LOT OF THE MUSIC HE'S FAMOUS FOR HOUND DOG AND JAILHOUSE ROCK AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
ARE BASED ON THE TWELVE BAR BLUES 
AND IT'S BECAUSE BLUES JAZZ 
WHAT'S CALLED R. AND AMP B. RHYTHM AND BLUES 
AND ROCK AND ROLL 
ALL COME FROM THE JAZZ AND BLUES ROOT IT ALL COMES FROM THAT 
WHY DO WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO JAZZ OR BLUES 
WELL YOU'RE LISTENING TO IT ANYWAY BUT JUST WAY WAY DOWN THE LINE 
SO DON'T FOOL YOURSELF THIS MUSIC HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH YOU 
THE LIST OF STYLES OF MUSIC THAT HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY JAZZ 
COULD GO ON AND ON 
AND JAZZ STYLES ARE CONTINUING TO CHANGE AND DEVELOP 
SO WE'RE BACK TO THE BEGINNING 
WHAT IS JAZZ AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO SO MANY MUSICIANS 
IT'S A QUESTION THAT'S GOT SEVERAL ANSWERS 
AND MUSIC IS SO BIG 
UNTIL YOU ONLY CAN HAVE TWO KINDS OF MUSIC 
GOOD AND BAD PERIOD 
I HONESTLY BELIEVE IT FORGET ABOUT THE NAMES 
THAT DON'T MEAN IT'S THE MOST SOULFUL PIECE JUST COS IT'S CLASSICAL 
THAT DON'T MEAN IT'S OUTSTANDING 
OR JUST BECAUSE IT'S JAZZ THAT DON'T MEAN IT'S OUTSTANDING 
THE NAME OF THE GAME I HAVE FOUND IN MY YEARS WITH MUSIC 
I HAVE FOUND AS GOOD MUSIC IN EVERY BRANCH THAT YOU GUYS WANNA GIVE 
I CAN FIND YOU SOME GREAT MUSIC IN COUNTRY AND WESTERN OR BLUEGRASS 
I CAN FIND YOU SOME GREAT MUSIC IN CLASSICAL 
SOME GREAT MUSIC IN IN RHYTHM AND BLUES 
MARVELLOUS MUSIC IN JAZZ 
WHEN I FIRST STARTED PLAYING 
AND BEGAN TO RECOGNISE THAT THERE WAS A WHOLE WORLD 
OF PEOPLE PLAYING 
I'D PLAY EVERYTHING THAT I HEARD COS I THOUGHT ALL MUSICIANS PLAYED EVERYTHING THAT YOU EVER HEARD 
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WERE SPECIALISTS 
SO WITH A SONG I DIDN'T KNOW I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT DIDN'T KNOW IT YET 
I REMEMBER MY MOTHER BOUGHT AN EMERSON RECORD PLAYER 
AND WITH THAT RECORD PLAYER THEY USED TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF ALBUMS 
AND THERE WAS AN ALBUM THAT CAME WITH THAT THAT HAD GRIEG'S PIANO CONCERTO 
YOU KNOW THAT ON AND ON 
SO I PUT THAT RECORD ON AND BEGAN LEARNING GRIEG'S PIANO CONCERTO 
BECAUSE I THOUGHT ALL PIANISTS MUST ALREADY BE PLAYING THIS EXCEPT ME 
SO I BEGAN PLAYING EVEN THE CLASSICS BY EAR 
THAT'S THE MAIN THING LISTEN AND 
TO THROW THE EGO OUT THE WINDOW 
YOU KNOW IN OTHER WORDS THAT REQUIRES KNOWING WHEN TO BE SILENT YEAH 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY ALL THE TIME 
TRY TO FIND SOMETHING THAT CAN ADD ANOTHER COLOUR OR ANOTHER FLAVOUR TO WHAT'S ALREADY THERE 
UM AGAIN LISTENING IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS 
AND TRUSTING OTHER MUSICIANS AND YOURSELF 
ONE OF THE THINGS EVERY JAZZ MUSICIAN DOES 
THEY FIND SOMETHING THEY LIKE AND LISTEN TO IT REPEATEDLY 
IN FACT YOU CAN FIND SOMETHING YOU DON'T LIKE AND LISTEN TO IT 
SO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO LEARN ABOUT JAZZ AND ARE INTERESTED IN IT CHECK OUT SOMETHING THAT YOU LIKE 
AND LISTEN TO IT REPEATEDLY OR YOU WOULD FIND OUT WHAT IS GREAT 
FIND THE SEMINAL ALBUM AND LISTEN TO IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
AFTER THAT YOU'LL GET A SENSE OF WHAT JAZZ IS ABOUT 
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT THIS ME TELLING YOU WHAT IT IS 
IT'S ABOUT EXPERIENCING THE MUSIC 
LISTEN TO IT ON RECORD ON THE RADIO ON TELEVISION WHEN IT IS THERE AND LISTEN TO IT IN CONCERT 
IF YOU THINK ROCK BANDS HAVE ENERGY BELIEVE ME YOU'VE SEEN NOTHING 
FOR ANY YOUNG MUSICIAN 
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY 
BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF COS YOU CAN FEEL IT 
NOBODY'S GOTTA TELL YOU 
IF YOU KNOW YOU GOT SOMETHING 
A LOT OF TIMES YOU'RE GONNA GET DISCOURAGED 
I HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE TELL ME HEY KID IT AIN'T HAPPENING 
BUT IF YOU FEEL YOU GOT SOMETHING 
THEN WHATEVER YOU DO 
DON'T LET ANYBODY DISCOURAGE YOU FROM DOING WHAT YOU FEEL YOU SHOULD 
HOWEVER I WILL TELL YOU ONE THING 
IF YOU'RE GONNA DEAL WITH MUSIC 
IT IS THE SAME AS IT IS IN SPORT OR ANY OTHER ENDEAVOUR FOR THAT MATTER 
YOU MUST PRACTISE 
THAT'S THE HARD PART TO GET YOUNG PEOPLE TO DO 
THEY WANNA DO IT BUT THEY DON'T REALISE THAT THERE'S A PRICE TO PAY 
AND YOU GOT TO PRACTISE 
TO ME JAZZ IS ABOUT SEIZING THE MOMENT 
GRABBING THAT MOMENT IN TIME AND MAKING SOMETHING OF IT 
IF YOU SEE AN OPPORTUNITY YOU GO FOR IT 
IT MIGHT WORK OUT IT MIGHT NOT THAT FOR ME IS WHAT JAZZ IS ABOUT 
DON'T FEEL THAT YOU'RE GONNA PICK UP A GUITAR AND YOU LEARN TWO CHORDS 
AND PLAY 'EM LOUD AND THINK YOU'RE GOOD 
THAT AIN'T IT 
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD YOU GOT TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY THAT GUITAR OR THAT PIANO IN ANY KEY 
BUT REMEMBER THAT THE INSTRUMENT ISN'T WHAT MAKES THE MUSIC 
IT'S THE PERSON WHAT YOU PUT INTO IT AS A HUMAN BEING IS WHAT MUSIC IS ABOUT 
MUSIC IS A STORY OF LIFE THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT 
IT'S NOT ABOUT G. SEVENS AND E. FLAT MINOR SEVENS 
IT'S REALLY ABOUT PASSION COURAGE TRUST 
SPIRIT 
THOSE GOOD THINGS THAT ARE PRICELESS 
MY NAME'S KULJIT BAHMRA AND I'M A RECORD PRODUCER 
MUSICIAN AND COMPOSER I'M MOSTLY KNOWN IN THE ASIAN COMMUNITY FOR HAVING PIONEERED THE BHANGRA CRAZE 
I'M CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN BOMBAY DREAMS AND I'M AN ON STAGE PERCUSSIONIST 
AND ALSO I'M THE HINDUSTANI DIALECT COACH FOR THE SHOW 
IT'S QUITE STRANGE THAT I ENDED UP BEING THE VOICE COACH FOR THE SHOW 
BECAUSE I COULDN'T SPEAK ANY INDIAN LANGUAGES UNTIL I WAS FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN 
MY FATHER WAS QUITE STRICT IN BELIEVING THAT SINCE WE'RE LIVING IN ENGLAND 
WE SHOULD SPEAK ENGLISH SO AT HOME WE ALL SPEAK ENGLISH 
IN THE LATE EIGHTIES AND THE NINETIES I WAS ASKED TO RECORD SONGS FOR BANDS 
I HAD TO GET INTO THE LANGUAGE TO PRODUCE THE RIGHT SORT OF MUSIC 
SO I WOULD GO AND SEE MY MUM AND SAY MUM WHAT DOES THIS WORD MEAN 
A LOT OF THE LANGUAGE IN SONGS CAN PUT ROUND DIFFERENT WAYS FOR THE SAKE OF METRE AND RHYMING 
SO IT MADE IT EVEN MORE CONFUSING 
I HAD TO LEARN HOW TO PRONOUNCE THE WORDS AS WELL 
THAT WAS REALLY TOUGH FOR ME BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN WORDS 
LIKE DE OR TE WHICH COME FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF YOUR THROAT 
I HAD TO LEARN PUNJABI FOR THE BHANGRA STUFF 
HINDUSTANI FOR THE BOLLYWOOD SIDE OF THINGS 
AND THEN I HAD TO LEARN URDU WHICH IS MORE OF A POETICAL FORM OF LYRICS 
LUCKILY FOR ME PUNJABI HINDUSTANI AND URDU HAVE A COMMON THREAD 
SOME OF THE WORDS ARE QUITE SIMILAR BUT THEY'RE PRONOUNCED DIFFERENTLY 
I STILL COME ACROSS PHRASES I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND I CHECK WITH MY MUM 
MY RECORDING STUDIO IS IN SOUTHALL IT'S LIKE THE PUNJAB IN INDIA 
I'M RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THE CULTURE AND THE MUSIC SCENE 
BHANGRA HAS BECOME VERY POPULAR NOWADAYS 
THE MUSIC'S REALLY RAW AND RUSTIC AND DANCEY AND VERY POWERFUL 
AT THE TIME OF THE SOUTHALL RIOTS IN THE SEVENTIES AND EARLY EIGHTIES 
WHEN THE COMMUNITY FELT UNDER ATTACK 
I THINK WE WANTED OUR OWN MUSICAL IDENTITY AND BHANGRA WAS THERE AT THE PERFECT TIME 
AND NOW IT'S IN THE CHARTS 
IT'S COMMON NOW TO HAVE A RAP TRACK WITH INDIAN VOCALS IN THE BACKGROUND 
AND I THINK A LOT OF THE YOUNG BRITISH ASIAN MUSICIANS FEEL LEFT OUT 
BECAUSE THEY WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO SING THEMSELVES OR UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THE INDIAN LYRICS 
A LOT OF THEM DON'T SPEAK THE MOTHER TONGUE 
I REALLY THINK YOUNG BRITISH ASIANS SHOULD MAKE MORE OF AN EFFORT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEIR LANGUAGE 
AND ABOUT THE CULTURE BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH A RICH CULTURE 
WE'VE GOT BHANGRA SONGS IN THE CHARTS BOMBAY DREAMS IN THE WEST END 
EVERYTHING'S TURNING TOWARDS INDIAN CULTURE WHICH I'M REALLY PLEASED ABOUT
