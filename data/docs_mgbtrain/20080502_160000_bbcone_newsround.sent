HI THERE WE ARE LIVE WITH 
NEWSROUND THESE ARE THE HEADLINES 
ANOTHER BRITISH FOOTBALL SUCCESS 
STORY IS IT ALL GOOD NEWS FOR THE 
PITCH PITCH THE COMPETITION WHERE THEY LET YOU 
BREAK THE SWIMMING POOL RULES THAT 
LOOKS SLIGHTLY PAINFUL 
CONGRATULATIONS GLASGOW RANGERS 
THE THIRD BRITISH TEAM TO MAKE IT 
TO A EUROPEAN FINAL THIS SEASON IF 
OUR CLUB TEAMS ARE SO GOOD WHY 
HAVEN'T OUR NATIONAL SIDES 
QUALIFIED FOR EURO TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
IT WAS A NAIL HCH NAIL BITING END 
TO AN EXCITING GAME RANGERS KEPT 
THEIR COOL AND MANAGED TO WIN THEY 
BOOKED THEMSELVES THE FIRST PLACE 
IN A EUROPEAN FINAL FOR THIRTY SIX YEARS 
THERE ARE TWO BIG EUROPEAN 
COMPETITIONS EACH YEAR THE UEFA 
CUP WHICH IS THE ONE RANGERS VIDEO 
GOT THROUGH AND THE CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE SO THE BIG QUESTION IS IF 
THREE BRITISH TEAMS ARE GOOD ENOUGH 
TO GET THROUGH TO THE FINALS OF 
THESE MASSIVE COMPETITIONS WHY ARE 
NONE OF OUR NATIONAL TEAMS NEITHER 
ENGLAND WALES NOR SCOTLAND NOR 
NORTHERN IRELAND GOOD ENOUGH TO 
QUALIFY FOR THE BIG IMPORTANT 
NATIONAL COMPETITIONS LIKE EURO 
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THAT IS ARE GOING ON THIS 
SUMMER A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK A LOT 
OF BIG BRITISH TEAMS ARE FULL OF 
PLAYERS BORN OUTSIDE THE U. K. SO 
THEY PLAY FOR LOTS OF NATIONAL 
TEAMS 
I THINK FOREIGN PLAYERS MAKE TEAMS BRITISH TEAMS STRONGER ENGLAND AND 
SCOTLAND HAVE SOME VERY GOOD 
PLAYERS WITHOUT THE FOREIGN 
PLAYERS MANCHESTER UNITED CHELSEA 
AND RANGERS THEY WOULD NOT HAVE GT 
TO THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL IT IT SEEMS WHAT WE REALLY NEED ARE SOME 
MORE DECENT BRITISH PLAYERS TO PLAY 
FOR OUR NATIONAL TEAMS SO YOU LOT 
GET PRACTICING MAYBE WE WILL SEE 
YOU AT EURO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY MORE STORIES NOW 
A PARENTLY CHOCOLATE IS BEING 
USED BY SOME TEACHERS TO REWARD YOU 
FOR DOING WELL IN CLASS OTHERS ARE 
NOT TOO HAPPY ABOUT IT AND THINK IT 
WOULD BE BETTER TO GIVE YOU HEALTHY 
TREATS AN ANCIENT SQUARE IN ITALY 
IS GETTING IN A FLAP OVER PIGEONS 
LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE SO WORRIED 
ABOUT THE DROPPING THEY HAVE BANNED 
PEOPLE FROM FEEDING THEM FORTY THOUSAND OF 
THE BIRDS FLOCK THROUGH SAINT MARC'S 
SQUARE EVERY SINGLE DAY L. AM SURE 
YOU ARE OFTEN TOLD IT IS IMPORTANT 
TO WORK HARD IN SCHOOL AND DO YOUR 
BEST SHOULD YOU WORRY IF YOU 
STRUGGLE WITH YOUR SUMS OR FIND 
TESTS TRICKY 
SITTING TESTS AND EXAMS CAN BE 
PRETTY STRESSFUL IT DOES NOT NEED 
TO BE IF YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET A 
GOLD STAR FOR YOUR SPELLINGS OR 
COME TOP OF THE CLAS IT DOES NOT 
MEAN YOU ARE A FAIL FAILURE L. 
MET SOMEONE WHO LEFT SCHOOL AT ELEVEN 
AND NOW RUNS HIS OWN CHOCOLATE 
FACTORY 
I HAD PROBLEMS AT SCHOOL FACTORY I HAVE GOT DYSLEXIA THROUGH THAT 
MY PARENTS AND I DECIDED I WOULD 
LEAVE SCHOOL AT ELEVEN TO TRY SOMETHING 
DIFFERENT I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED 
COOKING AND DISCOVERED I HAD A. A. L. 
LANT FOR MAKING CHOCOLATE LEAVING LEAVING SCHOOL WAS NOT THE EASY OPTION NO NO LEAVING SCHOOL WAS A LOT HARDER 
THAN STAYING AT SCHOOL WOULD HAVE 
BEEN IT IS WORKING HARD TO PROVE 
MYSELF I HAVE GOT TO PROVE MYSELF 
TO MY MUM AND DAD TO THE EDUCATION 
PEOPLE WHO COME OUT AND SAY LOOK 
YOU ARE NOT AT SCHOOL THIS IS WHAT 
YOU NEED TO DO EVERYONE ELSE 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS THEY WERE NOT 
IMPRESSED THAT I HAD LEFT SCHOOL AT 
ELEVEN IT WITH US NOT THE EASIEST 
ROUTE 
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO ROUTE SOMEONE STRUGGLING AT SCHOOL I I WOULD SAY SCHOOL HELPS A LOT OF 
KIDS THERE ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO 
DO NOT FIT IN WHO ARE BORED OR 
JUST DON'T DO WELL L. WOULD SAY 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T DO WELL DOES NOT 
MEAN YOU WILL NOT BE A SUCCESS WHY WHY DO SOME OF YOU WORRY ABOUT GETTING 
GOOD GRADES 
SCHOOL WORK IS 
IMPORTANT ABOUT GETTING A JOB I I THINK WHAT MIGHT WORRY ME AT SCHOOL 
WOULD BE ANSWERS WRONG AND IF YOU 
ARE ASKED A QUESTION YOU DON'T 
UNDERSTAND 
I THINK IF I AM NOT UNDERSTAND GOOD IN CLASSES AND THAT THEY MIGHT 
BULLY ME 
IF SOMEONE IS STRUGGLING 
AT SCHOOL SHOULD THEY BE WORRIED 
THEY SHOULD NOT BE WORRIED IT IS 
VERY COMMON FOR PEOPLE TO FIND SOME 
BITS CHALLENGING ASK FOR HELP 
MAKE GOOD USE OF THAT HELP DON'T 
BE EMBARRASSED IT IS NOT UNUSUAL 
IF YOU FIND IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR YOU 
YOU FIND THE LEARNING PROCESS 
UNCOMFORTABLE THINK ABOUT YOUR 
OTHER SKILLS AND ABILITIES 
SO IF 
YOU ARE NOT TOP OF THE CLASS DON'T 
WORRY YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND 
SOMETHING ELSE YOU ARE GOOD AT 
THEY LOOK LOVELY IF YOU ARE 
WORRIED ABOUT ANY OF THE SUBJECTS
