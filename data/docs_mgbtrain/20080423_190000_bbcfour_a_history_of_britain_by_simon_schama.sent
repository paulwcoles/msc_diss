ENGLAND ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR NEARLY A CENTURY AFTER THE BATTLE OF HASTINGS 
THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN TORN APART BY A SAVAGE CIVIL WAR 
WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR WAS LONG DEAD 
FOR THIRTY YEARS HIS GRANDCHILDREN HAD BEEN LOCKED IN A LIFE OR DEATH STRUGGLE FOR THE CROWN OF ENGLAND 
THE REALM WAS IN RUINS 
AND THEN THERE APPEARED A YOUNG KING BRAVE AND CHARISMATIC 
WHO STOPPED THE ANARCHY 
HIS NAME WAS HENRY AND HE WOULD BECOME THE GREATEST OF ALL OUR MEDIEVAL KINGS 
HE SHOULD BE AS WELL KNOWN TO US AS HENRY THE EIGHTH OR ELIZABETH I 
BUT IF HE IS REMEMBERED AT ALL TODAY IT IS AS THE KING WHO ORDERED THE MURDER IN THE CATHEDRAL 
OR AS THE FATHER OF THE MUCH MORE FAMOUS AND IMPOSSIBLY BAD KING JOHN 
AND THE IMPOSSIBLY GLAMOROUS RICHARD THE LIONHEART 
HENRY THE SECOND HAS NO GREAT MONUMENT TO HIS REIGN 
NO HORSEBACK STATUE OF HIM STANDS OUTSIDE WESTMINSTER 
YET HE MADE AN INDELIBLE MARK ON OUR COUNTRY 
THE FATHER OF THE COMMON LAW THE GODFATHER OF THE ENGLISH STATE 
BUT HENRY WAS CURSED BROUGHT DOWN BY THE CHURCH HIS CHILDREN 
AND MOST OF ALL BY HIS QUEEN THE OLDER BEAUTIFUL ALL POWERFUL ELEANOR OF AQUITAINE 
THIS IS THE STORY OF HENRY THE SECOND AND HIS FAMILY 
IN ALL OF BRITISH HISTORY THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE IT 
HENRY THE SECOND HIS WIFE ELEANOR AND THEIR CHILDREN RICHARD AND JOHN 
WERE THE MOST ASTONISHING OF ALL THE FAMILY FIRMS TO HAVE RUN THE ENTERPRISE OF BRITAIN 
THEY DID SO WITH A FURIOUS ENERGY THAT EITHER ENTRANCED OR APPALLED THEIR SUBJECTS 
THEY HAD A CAPACITY FOR BOTH CREATION AND SELF DESTRUCTION 
WHAT THEIR INTELLIGENCE BUILT THEIR PASSIONS DESTROYED 
THEY WERE CALLED THE ANGEVINS 
NAMED AFTER THE FRENCH SPEAKING PROVINCE OF ANJOU 
AT THE HEIGHT OF THEIR POWER THEY WERE THE MASTERS OF EVERYTHING THAT COUNTED IN CHRISTENDOM 
ENGLAND WAS THE LINCHPIN OF AN EMPIRE THAT STRETCHED FROM THE SCOTTISH BORDERS TO THE PYRENEES 
MUCH BIGGER THAN FRANCE ITSELF 
NOT SINCE THE ROMANS AND NEVER AGAIN HAS ENGLAND BEEN QUITE SO EUROPEAN 
THE DYNASTY HAD ITS ROOTS IN A CIVIL WAR 
THAT WAS BEING FOUGHT BY TWO COUSINS STEPHEN AND MATILDA 
THE GRANDCHILDREN OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR 
STEPHEN SEIZED THE CROWN BUT IF MATILDA COULDN'T BEAT HIM WITH AN ARMY SHE COULD DO SO WITH A WEDDING 
ONE THAT WOULD FOUND A DYNASTY AND REDUCE STEPHEN'S AMBITIONS TO DUST 
IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT MATILDA MARRIED GEOFFREY OF ANJOU 
NICKNAMED PLANTAGENET BECAUSE HE WORE A SPRIG OF YELLOW BROOM OR PLANTA GENISTA IN HIS HAT 
HIS FAMILY EMBLEM WAS THREE LIONS 
ALONG WITH HIS MONEY POWER AND TERRITORY GEOFFREY GAVE MATILDA SOMETHING EVEN MORE IMPORTANT 
A SON HENRY 
AS THE BOY HENRY GREW UP IT BECAME APPARENT THAT FROM HIS MOTHER HE'D INHERITED STEELY SINGLE MINDEDNESS 
LOTS OF PHYSICAL COURAGE AND A PHENOMENALLY FOUL TEMPER 
FROM HIS FATHER HE'D GOT INSTINCTIVE CHARM AND KNIFE SHARP POLITICAL AND MILITARY INTELLIGENCE 
BUT THE QUALITY THAT ANYONE WHO EVER MET HENRY MOST VIVIDLY REMEMBERED 
THE OVERFLOWING TANK OF ENERGY 
THAT MADE HIM THE MOST HYPERACTIVE KING IN BRITISH HISTORY 
THIS WAS ALL HIS OWN 
THIS WAS THE AGE OF CHIVALRY WHEN THE MYTH OF ARTHUR AND CAMELOT WAS AT ITS MOST POPULAR 
RIGHT FROM THE START HENRY WAS GROOMED BY HIS AMBITIOUS PARENTS TO TAKE ENGLAND AWAY FROM STEPHEN 
TO BECOME A NEW KING ARTHUR 
AND TO DO THIS OF COURSE HE WOULD NEED A GUINEVERE 
AS IT HAPPENED THE PERFECT CANDIDATE HAD JUST BECOME AVAILABLE 
ELEANOR OF AQUITAINE 
BUT THE MATCH WAS A GAMBLE HE WAS NINETEEN SHE WAS PUSHING THIRTY 
HE WAS RELATIVELY INEXPERIENCED 
ELEANOR HAD SEEN AS MUCH OF THE WAYS OF THE WORLD AS IT COULD POSSIBLY OFFER 
AND YET SOMETHING RATHER SURPRISING HAPPENED BETWEEN THE TEENAGE ARTHUR AND THE MERCURIAL GUINEVERE 
SOMETHING NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN IN A MARRIAGE OF POLITICAL CONVENIENCE 
THE PARTIES ACTUALLY FANCIED EACH OTHER 
HENRY FOUND HIMSELF AT THE ALTAR IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO BESIDE AN OLDER WOMAN DESCRIBED AS A GRACEFUL DARK EYED BEAUTY 
DISCONCERTINGLY ARTICULATE STRONG MINDED AND JOCULAR HARDLY THE VEILED DAMSEL IN THE TOWER 
ONE LIKES TO THINK THAT FOR HER PART ELEANOR SAW NOT JUST THE USUAL FEUDAL SPUR CLANKING BONEHEAD 
BUT BEYOND A STOCKY FRAME AND BARREL CHEST SOMEONE WHO WAS AN INTRIGUING PECULIARITY 
THE RARE PRINCE WHO LOOKED RIGHT WITH A FALCON ON ONE HAND AND A BOOK IN THE OTHER 
BUT IT WAS ELEANOR'S HOMELAND AQUITAINE THAT WAS THE GREATEST PRIZE 
A VAST STRETCH OF LAND BETWEEN ANJOU AND THE PYRENEES 
A PLACE WHERE WINE STEEPED LATIN CULTURE HAD BEEN POLISHED ANEW BY PROVENCAL SENSUALITY 
ITS CAPITAL HERE IN POITIERS THE HOME OF TROUBADOURS AND COURTLY LOVE 
NO WONDER THEN THAT ELEANOR GREW UP AS HER CONTEMPORARIES PUT IT WELCOMING VIVACIOUS 
HER HANDSOME HEAD PERHAPS TURNED BY ALL THOSE LOVELORN LYRICS OF KNIGHTS ENSLAVED BY BEAUTIES 
AND BENT ON BESIEGING THEIR VIRTUE 
SO THIS IS WHAT ELEANOR BROUGHT TO THE MATCH 
GRANDEUR TERRITORY WEALTH A LOT OF WEALTH AND THE GLAMOUR OF AQUITAINE 
NO WONDER HENRY THOUGHT THAT WITH THIS MARRIAGE HE'D GOT WELL PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING 
EVERYTHING THAT IS EXCEPT THE CROWN OF ENGLAND 
IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE HENRY PLANTAGENET CROSSED THE CHANNEL HIS FATHER GEOFFREY HAD ALREADY TAKEN NORMANDY FROM STEPHEN 
SO NOW IT WAS UP TO HENRY TO TAKE ENGLAND 
FACED WITH AN EXHAUSTED NATION AND DEFECTING BARONS 
STEPHEN CAVED IN A DEAL WAS STRUCK 
STEPHEN WOULD BE ALLOWED TO DIE ON THE THRONE ON CONDITION HE NAMED HENRY AS HIS HEIR 
WITHIN A YEAR STEPHEN WAS DEAD 
AND ELEANOR AND HENRY WERE CROWNED TOGETHER AT WESTMINSTER ABBEY KING AND QUEEN OF ENGLAND 
WHEN THEY EMERGED THEY WERE THE FRENCH SPEAKING SOVEREIGNS 
OF AN ENORMOUS REALM WHICH STRETCHED FROM THE PYRENEES THROUGH THE VINEYARDS OF GASCONY 
ALONG THE COD FISH RUN COASTAL WATERS OF BRITTANY THEN OVER THE CHANNEL TO ENGLAND 
ALONG THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE COUNTRY TO THE WELSH BORDERS 
AND THE WINDY MOORS OF CUMBRIA AND NORTHUMBRIA 
AND IT WAS A PERFECT TIME TO COME INTO THIS COLOSSAL INHERITANCE 
FOR THE MID TWELFTH CENTURY REALLY WAS THE SPRINGTIME OF THE MIDDLE AGES 
LITERACY AND LEARNING WERE SPREADING FROM THE CATHEDRAL SCHOOLS IN PARIS AND CANTERBURY 
MONASTERIES WERE BEING FOUNDED AT A RECORD PACE AND ALTHOUGH THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE PURGED OF WORLDLINESS 
BEFORE LONG THEY WERE THE ENGINES OF ECONOMIC POWER PRODUCERS OF WOOL MASTERS OF THE MILLS AND RIVERS 
SO IF THIS WAS INDEED SPRINGTIME 
HENRY AND ELEANOR HAD JUST GOT THEMSELVES THE FATTEST AND THE RIPEST FRUIT 
STILL IT'S UNLIKELY THEY EVER THOUGHT OF IT AS A TRUE EMPIRE IN THE ROMAN SENSE OF A SINGLE REALM 
ITS REGIONS WERE TREATED SEPARATELY ACCORDING TO THEIR CUSTOMS 
WHILE WESTMINSTER WAS INCREASINGLY AT THE HEART OF ADMINISTRATION 
ROUEN IN NORMANDY CHINON IN ANJOU AND POITIERS IN AQUITAINE WERE JUST AS IMPORTANT 
IT WAS RATHER THE GREATEST AND GRANDEST FAMILY ESTATE IN ALL CHRISTENDOM 
THAT SURELY WAS ENOUGH TO BE GOING ON WITH 
IT WAS ONE THING TO STAND AROUND COUNTING OFF ONE'S POSSESSIONS 
IT WAS QUITE ANOTHER THING TO KNOW WHAT ONE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT BEING KING 
ESPECIALLY KING OF A COUNTRY SO PROMISING BUT SO PECULIAR AS ENGLAND WITH ALL ITS ANGLO SAXON NAMES 
AND INSTITUTIONS LIKE SHIRE COURTS WRITS AND SHERIFFS 
WHAT DID HENRY PLANTAGENET KNOW OF HUNTINGDONSHIRE 
OR FOR THAT MATTER WHAT DID HUNTINGDONSHIRE KNOW OF HENRY PLANTAGENET 
HENRY OF COURSE SPOKE VIRTUALLY NO ENGLISH AT ALL 
WHAT HE WOULD HAVE GRASPED THOUGH IF ONLY FROM HIS CORONATION OATHS 
WAS THAT KINGS OF ENGLAND WERE SUPPOSED TO BE BOTH JUDGE AND WARLORD 
IN FACT THE CORONATION OATH PRESERVED INTACT FROM EDWARD THE CONFESSOR 
WHO WAS INCREASINGLY BEING HELD UP AS SOME SORT OF IDEAL MONARCH 
PRETTY MUCH SPELLED OUT THE JOB DESCRIPTION OF THE KING OF ENGLAND 
ONE WAS PROTECT THE CHURCH TWO WAS PRESERVE INTACT THE LANDS OF YOUR ANCESTORS 
THREE DO JUSTICE AND FOUR AND MOST SWEEPING OF ALL SUPPRESS EVIL LAWS AND CUSTOMS 
FULFILLING ONE AND TWO WENT WITHOUT SAYING 
BUT WHAT WAS SURPRISING ABOUT HENRY WAS THAT HE TOOK VOWS THREE AND FOUR JUST AS SERIOUSLY 
BEFORE HENRY JUSTICE WAS DO WHAT I WANT I'M THE KING 
BY THE END OF HENRY'S REIGN GETTING THE KING'S JUSTICE DIDN'T DEPEND ON THE KING BEING THERE IN PERSON 
HENRY HAD ESTABLISHED PERMANENT PROFESSIONAL COURTS SITTING AT WESTMINSTER OR TOURING THE COUNTIES 
ACTING RELIABLY IN HIS NAME 
NOW LAW BECAME LISTEN TO WHAT MY JUDGES HAVE TO SAY 
BY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOSE JUDGES COULD CONSULT ENGLAND'S FIRST LEGAL TEXTBOOK 
FOR THE PRECEDENCE ON WHICH TO BASE THEIR DECISIONS 
THE LAW NOW HAD ITS OWN KIND OF MAJESTY 
IT WAS VOW NUMBER ONE THOUGH THE PROTECTION OF THE CHURCH 
WHICH QUITE UNPREDICTABLY WOULD CAUSE HENRY THE SECOND THE GREATEST GRIEF 
IT WAS TO PROVOKE A KIND OF SPIRITUAL CIVIL WAR 
IN ITS WAY EVERY BIT AS UNSETTLING AS THE FEUDAL CIVIL WAR 
AND WHICH IN ITS MOST DREADFUL HOUR WOULD END WITH BLOODSHED IN THE CATHEDRAL 
AND THIS WAS ESPECIALLY IRONIC 
SINCE AT THE OUTSET THE CHURCH SEEMED TO BE THE STRONGEST PILLAR OF HENRY'S ADMINISTRATION 
ITS LITERATE CLERICS INITIATED HIM INTO THE MYSTERIES OF GOVERNING ENGLAND 
SO WHEN THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY OFFERED UP ONE OF ITS BRIGHTEST PROTEGES THOMAS BECKET 
FOR THE OFFICE OF CHANCELLOR HENRY LISTENED LOOKED AND GAVE HIM THE JOB 
SO WHO EXACTLY WAS THIS BECKET THEN 
WELL FOR A START HE WAS THE FIRST COMMONER OF ANY KIND TO MAKE A MARK ON BRITISH HISTORY 
AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOMEONE LIKE BECKET 
A MERCHANT'S SON WITH AN IMPOVERISHED NORMAN KNIGHT CLANKING AROUND IN THE FAMILY CLOSET 
COULD END UP AS THE KING'S BEST FRIEND SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY 
OF THE GREAT SWARMING CITY ITSELF 
AT THE HEART OF THE EMERGING CAPITAL WAS THE GREAT CHURCH OF SAINT PAUL 
AND AROUND IT UPRIVER FROM THE GRIM PILE OF THE CONQUEROR'S TOWER 
WERE WHARVES THICK WITH SHIPS LOADED WITH WOOL GOING OUT WINE FURS OR SILKS COMING IN 
IN THIS TEEMING WORLD BECKET'S FATHER STRUTTED OWNER OF ONE OF THE GRANDEST HOUSES IN CHEAPSIDE 
BECKET WAS A REAL LONDONER 
WITH A NATURAL FLAIR FOR DOING WHAT LONDONERS LIKED DOING MOST THE GETTING AND SPENDING OF MONEY 
SPECTACLE COSTUME AND DESPITE HIS NOTORIOUSLY DELICATE GUT BECKET ALSO ENJOYED GOOD FOOD AND DRINK 
HE WAS STREET SMART AND HE WAS BOOK SMART IN SHORT FROM THE GET GO BECKET WAS A BIG LEAGUE PERFORMER 
HE WAS A PLAYER 
THEY WERE IN A WAY A MATCH OF OPPOSITES BECKET WAS OLDER BY A DECADE AND AS CHANCELLOR 
WILLING TO DEAL WITH ADMINISTRATIVE DETAIL THAT BORED THE KING 
BECKET WAS TALL SELF CONTAINED HIS FOREHEAD CREASED WITH FROWN LINES 
THE KING WAS SQUARE SHAPED PACKED WITH HECTIC PASSION A REAL PLANTAGENET POWERHOUSE 
ABOVE ALL BECKET WAS ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE RELENTLESS PACE SET BY HENRY HIMSELF 
MEDIEVAL COURTS WERE ITINERANT AFFAIRS TRAVELLING TWENTY THIRTY MILES A DAY 
EATING IN A ROYAL FOREST OR BY THE ROADSIDE 
BUT HENRY WHO MADE A FETISH OF EXERCISE OUT OF A FEAR SOME SAID OF GROWING FAT NEVER SLOWED DOWN 
BARELY ARRIVING AT ONE OF HIS PALACES BEFORE CHASING OFF AGAIN 
CLARENDON PALACE WAS THE MOST MAGNIFICENT HUNTING LODGE IN ENGLAND 
ALL THAT'S LEFT OF IT NOW IS THIS RAW IVY COVERED STUMP OF STONE 
BUT IN HENRY'S TIME THE PLACE WOULD HAVE BEEN FULL OF COURTIERS AND DOGS AND HAWKS AND HORSES 
THAT'S THE WAY THE KING LIKED IT 
A KIND OF SCRUFFY POWER TO HIS ENTERTAINMENT 
IN FACT BECKET SAW RIGHT THROUGH HENRY'S GAME OF STUDIED INFORMALITY 
THE WAY HE AVOIDED WEARING THE CROWN HIS PREFERENCE FOR ORDINARY RIDING CLOTHES 
BECKET KNEW THAT WHEN HENRY EXTENDED THE HAND OF FRIENDSHIP 
HE WAS CAPABLE OF FOLLOWING IT BY FROSTY WITHDRAWALS OF AFFECTION 
UNPREDICTABLE EXPLOSIONS OF CARPET BITING INCENDIARY FURY 
IT WAS THIS PSEUDO SIBLING RELATIONSHIP THAT GAVE BECKET THE CONFIDENCE LATER ON 
TO TREAT THE KING AS A VIRTUAL EQUAL WITH CATASTROPHIC RESULTS FOR ALL CONCERNED 
TIME AND AGAIN HE'D TELL HIS DWINDLING BAND OF FOLLOWERS 
LOOK I KNOW THIS LOOKS BAD BUT TRUST ME I KNOW THE WAY THIS MAN OPERATES 
EVEN IN THE EARLY DAYS BENEATH THE JESTING THERE WAS IF THOMAS LOOKED FOR IT A KIND OF OMINOUS TENSION 
WHEN FOR EXAMPLE THE KING AND THE CHANCELLOR RODE THROUGH LONDON 
HENRY POINTED TO THE COUNTLESS DESTITUTE AND EYEING THOMAS' GORGEOUS SCARLET AND GREY MINIVER EDGED CLOAK 
LET IT BE KNOWN HOW CHARITABLE IT WOULD BE TO CLOTHE THE POOR MAN'S NAKEDNESS 
WELL YES SAID BECKET YOU SHOULD ATTEND TO IT RIGHT AWAY 
OH NO NO YOU SHOULD HAVE THE CREDIT 
INSISTED THE KING PULLING AT BECKET'S CAPE 
AN UNDIGNIFIED TUG OF WAR THEN FOLLOWED WITH BOTH MEN TRYING TO PULL THE CAPES OFF EACH OTHER 
AT LAST THE CHANCELLOR HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO ALLOW THE KING TO OVERCOME HIM 
AND GIVE HIS CAPE TO THE POOR MAN 
YET IF HENRY SUSPECTED THOMAS OF GETTING ABOVE HIMSELF AND IF HE DID HE WASN'T ALONE 
IT DIDN'T GET IN THE WAY OF BECKET COMING TO MIND FOR THE TOP JOB IN THE COUNTRY 
THE NEWLY VACATED POST OF ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY 
IN FACT BECKET'S WORLDLINESS MUST HAVE MADE HIM SEEM PRECISELY THE RIGHT KIND OF MAN 
FOR THE JOB HENRY WANTED TO DO WHICH WAS TO PUT THE CHURCH IN ITS PLACE 
MONARCHS HAD LONG TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED 
THAT THEY WERE DIRECTLY ANOINTED BY GOD SAFELY ABOVE THE CHURCH 
BUT THE POPES OF THIS PERIOD BEGGED TO DIFFER 
KINGS THEY SAID REPORTED TO POPES NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND 
THIS WASN'T JUST AN ACADEMIC QUIBBLE THIS WAS A FIGHT TO THE DEATH 
THERE WERE TWO FLASH POINTS 
THE FIRST WAS WHETHER LAW BREAKING CLERGYMEN COULD BE JUDGED IN THE KING'S COURTS LIKE EVERYONE ELSE 
THE SECOND WAS WHETHER BISHOPS HAD THE POWER TO EXCOMMUNICATE ROYAL OFFICIALS 
BY MAKING BECKET ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY HENRY BELIEVED HE COULD DEPEND ON SOMEONE 
WHO WOULD SHARE HIS VIEW OF THE SUBORDINATE RELATIONSHIP OF CHURCH TO STATE 
THE KING WAS IN FOR A SHOCK 
AT THE BEGINNING AT LEAST THERE SEEMED TO BE A GOOD DEAL OF THE OLD BECKET ABOUT THE NEW BECKET 
THE ARRAY OF FANCY FOODS AND COMPANY OF YOUNG COSMOPOLITAN SCHOLARS REMAINED 
BUT ALL WAS NOT HOW IT APPEARED 
BECKET ATE NONE OF THE FEAST 
BENEATH HIS GRAND GARMENTS HE MAY WELL HAVE BEGUN TO WEAR THE HAIR SHIRT 
FOUND LATER ON HIS MURDERED BODY 
WHEN THE KING BEGAN TO REALISE THAT A MYSTERIOUS TRANSFORMATION HAD TAKEN PLACE IN BECKET 
WHEN FOR INSTANCE THE ARCHBISHOP STOOD UP IN PUBLIC AND OPPOSED IN THE MOST MILITANT LANGUAGE 
THE KING'S DEMAND FOR A NEW TAX ON THE CHURCH HENRY PLANTAGENET WENT ALTOGETHER BALLISTIC 
NOTHING MADE HIM MORE ENRAGED THAN A FRIENDSHIP AS HE SAW IT BETRAYED 
IT ALL CAME TO A HEAD HERE AT CLARENDON EARLY IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR 
WHEN HENRY SUMMONED A SPECIAL COUNCIL OF THE PRINCES OF THE CHURCH AND THE MOST IMPORTANT NOBLES OF THE REALM 
THERE HE ASKED WELL ACTUALLY HE DEMANDED 
THAT THEY ASSENT UNCONDITIONALLY TO WHAT HE CHOSE TO CALL THE CUSTOMS OF THE REALM 
BECKET WAS NO IDIOT HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THIS MEANT ROYAL CONTROL OVER THE CLERGY 
HE'D SEEN IT COMING FOR MONTHS AND HAD BEEN URGING HIS BISHOPS TO RESIST IT AT ALL COSTS 
AFTER ENDLESS PREVARICATION IN THE END BECKET REFUSED THE KING'S DEMANDS ORDERING TOTAL RESISTANCE 
A POSITION FROM WHICH HE'D NEVER BUDGE 
THE KING NOW MOVED THE WAY HE LIKED BEST THROUGH THE LAW 
IN OCTOBER ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR BECKET WAS BROUGHT TO TRIAL AT NORTHAMPTON 
ACCUSED AND THIS WAS THE KILLER OF IMPROPER USE OF FUNDS WHEN HE'D BEEN CHANCELLOR 
THE HALF JOKING COMMENTS ABOUT FANCY CLOTHES THAT HENRY HAD THROWN BECKET'S WAY STOPPED BEING FUNNY 
THEY'D BECOME A DEADLY CRIMINAL ACCUSATION 
WHEN THOMAS DECIDED TO DRESS UP FOR THE TRIAL IN FULL ARCHBISHOP'S RIG 
AND CARRY A HUGE SILVER CROSS JESUS LIKE 
HIS GREATEST RIVAL THE BISHOP OF LONDON TRIED TO SEIZE IT FROM HIM BUT BECKET'S GRIP WAS LIKE IRON 
A FOOL HE WAS A FOOL HE'LL ALWAYS BE WAS THE BISHOP'S COMMENT ON THIS PERFORMANCE 
THE TRIAL BROKE UP WITH BECKET STORMING OUT PERJURER TRAITOR YELLED HENRY'S BARONS 
WHOREMONGERS BASTARDS REPLIED THE ARCHBISHOP 
CONVICTED ON THE CHARGES BECKET KNEW HE WAS IN DIRE PERIL AND FLED ON THE NEAREST HORSE 
HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT HE WAS RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE 
BECKET AND A SMALL GROUP OF DIE HARD FOLLOWERS LANDED ON THE FLEMISH COAST 
THEY WERE BROKE DEMORALISED PROSTRATE WITH EXHAUSTION 
AND FLOODED WITH THE GRIM REALISATION OF WHAT THEY'D DONE 
THEY'D MADE THEMSELVES OUTLAWS FOR CHRIST 
THIS IS WHERE BECKET'S LITTLE FAMILY OF GOD ENDED UP 
THE CISTERCIAN ABBEY OF PONTIGNY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES SOUTH EAST OF PARIS 
BUILT IN SPARKLING WHITE LIMESTONE IT SEEMED A STUNNING ADVERTISEMENT FOR PURITY 
A PERFECT MATCH FOR THOMAS' TEMPERAMENT 
BUT THIS WAS NO MONKISH RETREAT 
IT PRETTY SOON BECAME APPARENT THAT WHAT BECKET HAD ESTABLISHED HERE WAS A REAL GOVERNMENT IN EXILE 
HE HAD HIS OWN PAN EUROPEAN INTELLIGENCE NETWORK 
HE HAD HIS LETTER SMUGGLERS WITH THE KNOW HOW TO GET THROUGH THE BLOCKADE HENRY HAD IMPOSED ON COMMUNICATION 
AND HE HAD HIS OWN VERSATILE PROPAGANDA DEPARTMENT 
BUT MOST OF ALL BECKET HAD HIS OWN UNWAVERING SENSE OF SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS 
PRETTY SOON THOUGH HENRY USED HIS OWN FORMIDABLE POWER TO TURN THE SCREWS ON BECKET'S SUPPORTERS 
THERE WERE ARRAIGNMENTS AND ARRESTS 
TERRIFYINGLY SUDDEN SUMMARY EVICTIONS THE SEIZURE OF LAND AND PROPERTY 
ANYONE ANYONE WHO SO MUCH AS THOUGHT ABOUT SAYING A GOOD WORD FOR THE TRAITOR ARCHBISHOP 
RISKED AT THE VERY LEAST DEPORTATION 
MESSENGERS CAUGHT CARRYING HIS MAIL WERE THROWN INTO PRISON 
INNOCENT RELATIVES INCRIMINATED BY FAMILY ASSOCIATION WERE TURNED INTO EXILES THEMSELVES 
IT TOOK TWO PAINFUL YEARS OF BACK AND FORTH DIPLOMACY AND INCREASINGLY IMPATIENT SIGNALS FROM THE POPE 
TO ARRANGE EVEN TALKS ABOUT TALKS 
AFTER A SERIES OF ABORTIVE RECONCILIATIONS IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY 
IT LOOKED AS THOUGH PEACE MIGHT FINALLY BREAK OUT 
THE LOCATION WAS TO BE A MEADOW SURROUNDED BY WOODS NEAR THE VILLAGE OF FRETEVAL 
A BEAUTIFUL PLACE REMARKED ONE OBSERVER 
ONLY LATER DID HE FIND OUT THAT THE LOCALS CALLED IT TRAITOR'S MEADOW 
HENRY AND THOMAS RODE OUT TO EACH OTHER AND THE KING TOOK OFF HIS HAT IN SALUTATION 
THE TWO OF THEM THEN EMBRACED AND SAT FOR HOURS TALKING 
THE ARCHBISHOP'S POSTERIOR MORTIFIED BY THE CHAFING OF HIS SECRET GOAT HAIR UNDERWEAR 
FOR ONCE THE KING WAS IN NO MOOD TO QUARREL 
AND AGREED NOT ONLY TO RESTORE THOMAS TO ALL HIS POWERS AND AUTHORITY 
BUT ALSO TO TREAT THOSE WHO WERE BECKET'S ENEMIES AS HIS OWN 
WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER AND BECKET HAD GOT EVERYTHING HE WANTED 
A DAM BROKE AND A TEARFUL WAVE OF EMOTIONS SWEPT THROUGH HIM 
BECKET DISMOUNTED AND FLUNG HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE KING'S HORSE 
THE KING GOT OFF HIS OWN MOUNT 
AND WALKED OVER TO HIS OLD FRIEND WHO'D BECOME HIS BITTEREST ENEMY AND BODILY LIFTED HIM UP 
PUT ONE FOOT IN THE STIRRUP AND HOISTED BECKET BACK INTO THE SADDLE 
THEY THEN RODE OVER TOGETHER TO THE END OF THE FIELD TO THE ROYAL TENT 
WHERE THE KING ANNOUNCED THAT HENCEFORTH THEY WERE FINALLY RECONCILED 
AND THAT HE WOULD NOW BE A MOST KIND AND MOST GENEROUS LORD 
AFTER THE PEACE WAS PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED HENRY ASKED THOMAS TO RIDE WITH THE COURT AWHILE 
BUT BECKET DECLINED THIS TURNED OUT TO BE MISTAKE NUMBER ONE 
THE KING HAD WANTED TO CATCH THE MOMENT HOLD IT A LITTLE LONGER 
HIS GOOD MOOD COULD VANISH AS FAST AS HIS BAD TEMPER COULD REAPPEAR 
MISTAKE NUMBER TWO WAS MUCH WORSE 
AS THE KING HAD PARDONED BECKET'S CLOSEST FOLLOWERS 
SOMEONE SUGGESTED THAT LIKEWISE THOMAS MIGHT LIKE TO FORGIVE THOSE WHO HAD STAYED LOYAL TO THE KING 
IT'S NOT THE SAME SAID BECKET 
AND IT WAS THIS FANATICAL INABILITY TO MEET HALFWAY TO LET BYGONES BE BYGONES 
THAT PROVED TO BE BECKET'S FATAL ERROR 
THE LAST MEETING BETWEEN THE KING AND BECKET TOOK PLACE ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER LOIRE 
AND IN A MOOD OF SAD FRIENDLINESS THE KING SAYS TO BECKET 
YOU KNOW IF ONLY YOU COULD DO WHAT I TELL YOU TO DO I'D ENTRUST YOU WITH EVERYTHING 
NO REPLY AND ONE IMAGINES A LONG PAUSE A SIGH A SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS AND THE KING GOES ON 
WELL GO IN PEACE AND WE SHALL MEET EITHER IN ROUEN OR IN ENGLAND 
AND THEN ANOTHER PAUSE AND BECKET COMES OUT WITH SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 
HE SAYS MY LORD IF WE PART ON THESE TERMS WE SHALL NOT MEET AGAIN IN THIS LIFE 
AND THE ROYAL TEMPER FLARES UP AND HENRY SAYS WHY DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A TRAITOR 
MEANING DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT I WILL ABANDON YOU WHEN I'VE GIVEN YOU MY PROTECTION 
AND BECKET LOOKS AT THE KING AND SAYS HEAVEN FORBID 
AND I THINK AS HE ALLOWED THAT PARTING SHOT SO FULL OF PAINED SINCERITY AND WISE GUY IRONY 
BECKET MUST HAVE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS 
THOMAS BECKET'S SHIP CAME INTO THE HARBOUR AT SANDWICH PROBABLY ON THE MORNING OF DECEMBER FIRST ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY 
AND WAS GREETED NOT ONLY BY A THRONG OF POOR PEOPLE BUT BY THREE ROYAL OFFICIALS ARMED TO THE TEETH 
AS THE STONES OF CANTERBURY CAME INTO SIGHT HE GOT OFF HIS HORSE TOOK OFF HIS BOOTS 
AND WALKED BAREFOOT THE REST OF THE WAY THROUGH ANTHEM SINGING CROWDS OF DEVOTEES 
AND WHEN HE ARRIVED HOME THOMAS BECKET DID WHAT HE SAID HE WOULD DO TO ALL THOSE WHO HAD OPPOSED HIM 
DURING HIS SIX YEARS OF EXILE 
SHOUTING THE DREADED CURSE MAY THEY BE DAMNED BY JESUS CHRIST 
HE EXCOMMUNICATED THEM 
BUT THE BISHOPS WERE NOT IN HELL THEY WERE AT HENRY'S COURT NEAR BAYEUX POURING VENOMOUS REPORTS 
IN THE KING'S EAR ABOUT BECKET'S IMPOSSIBLE VIRTUALLY TREASONOUS ARROGANCE 
AND HENRY WHO TYPICALLY SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE PROMISES AT FRETEVAL 
RAISED HIS HEAD FROM HIS PILLOW AND LET OUT A ROAR OF PLANTAGENET ANATHEMA 
AND IT WAS NOT WILL NO ONE RID ME OF THIS TURBULENT PRIEST 
BUT A MUCH MORE ALARMING OUTCRY 
WHAT MISERABLE DRONES AND TRAITORS HAVE I NOURISHED AND BROUGHT UP IN MY HOUSEHOLD 
WHO LET THEIR LORD BE TREATED WITH SUCH SHAMEFUL CONTEMPT BY A LOW BORN CLERIC 
TO ANYONE WHO'D WITNESSED HENRY'S TERRIBLE MELT DOWN OR HAD EVEN HEARD ABOUT IT 
HIS WORDS COULD ONLY MEAN ONE THING 
THAT HE WANTED THE INTERMINABLE INSUFFERABLE BECKET PROBLEM TO GO AWAY 
NOT GO AWAY AS IN SIX FEET UNDER PERHAPS BUT THEN IF THAT'S WHAT IT TOOK SO BE IT 
HE WAS AFTER ALL A TRAITOR AND WELL WHAT HAPPENS TO TRAITORS 
THE FOUR KNIGHTS WHO WOULD KILL BECKET HAD NO DOUBT ABOUT WHAT HENRY HAD IN MIND 
AND RUSHED TO NORMANDY TO TAKE A SHIP TO KENT 
DAWN THE NEXT DAY DECEMBER TWENTY NINTH ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY BECKET'S LAST 
REGINALD FITZURSE WILLIAM DE TRACY ROBERT LE BRAY AND HUGH DE MORVILLE 
ARRIVED IN ENGLAND AND SET OFF FOR CANTERBURY 
AT AROUND THREE THEY BURST INTO THE ARCHBISHOP'S PALACE WHERE THEY FOUND THOMAS WITH HIS ADVISERS 
WHEN THE KNIGHTS CAME IN HE STUDIOUSLY IGNORED THEM 
REGINALD FITZURSE BROKE THE SILENCE BY SAYING HE HAD AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THE KING 
BECKET SHOULD GO TO WINCHESTER AND GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF HIS CONDUCT 
BECKET SAID HE HAD NO INTENTION OF BEING TREATED LIKE A CRIMINAL THINGS RAPIDLY GOT UGLY 
FITZURSE OMINOUSLY DECLARED THAT BECKET WAS NO LONGER UNDER THE KING'S PEACE 
OUGHT BECKET TO HAVE TEMPORISED TO HAVE MADE AN ESCAPE WHILE THERE WAS STILL TIME 
MY MIND IS MADE UP HE TOLD HIS FOLLOWER JOHN OF SALISBURY I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE TO DO 
PLEASE GOD YOU HAVE CHOSEN WELL REPLIED JOHN 
AND INSTEAD OF BOLTING THOMAS PROCEEDED TO THE CATHEDRAL FOR VESPERS 
HE MADE SURE THE DOOR WAS OPEN TO RECEIVE THE CONGREGATION HE HAD CHOSEN HIS PLACE 
HE HAD WRITTEN IN HIS MIND HIS LAST AND GREATEST PERFORMANCE 
THEY CAUGHT UP WITH HIM HERE IN THE NORTH TRANSEPT OF THE CATHEDRAL 
AND BECKET MUST HAVE SEEN RIGHT AWAY THAT THEY MEANT BUSINESS 
BECAUSE THEY WERE GOT UP IN THE STANDARD KIT OF TERRORIST THUGS 
FACE AND HEAD COVERED CHAIN MAIL OF COURSE 
THEY WERE CARRYING NAKED SWORDS AND SHOUTING WHERE IS THE TRAITOR 
BECKET REPLIED HERE I AM NO TRAITOR TO THE KING BUT A PRIEST OF GOD 
THE ARCHBISHOP SEEMED CALM BUT NO ONE ELSE WAS 
HIS ATTENDANTS ALL EXCEPT TWO DISAPPEARED INTO THE SHADOWS OF THE CHURCH 
BUT THE FIFTY TWO YEAR OLD BECKET WAS REMEMBER A COCKNEY A STREET FIGHTER 
TOUGH AS OLD BOOTS UNDER THE COWL AND WHEN HE STOOD ROOTED TO THE SPOT HE BECAME PHYSICALLY 
AS WELL AS THEOLOGICALLY THE IMMOVABLE OBJECT 
AT SUCH TIMES THE KIND OF TALK HE'D PICKED UP IN HIS CHEAPSIDE CHILDHOOD CAME BACK TO HIM RIPE AND ABUSIVE 
WHOREMONGER HE YELLED AT FITZURSE 
WHO MUST SUDDENLY HAVE FELT RIDICULOUS CLANKING AROUND IN ALL THAT ARMOUR 
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU CAN'T STAND FEELING RIDICULOUS ANY LONGER 
WHOOSH GOES THE ADRENALINE BANG GOES THE GUN OR IN THIS CASE THE SWORD 
THROUGH BECKET'S ATTENDANT'S ARM THEN SLICING THROUGH THE TOP OF THE ARCHBISHOP'S HEAD 
THE CROWN HUNG BY A THREAD OF FLESH AS BECKET SANK TO THE FLOOR MURMURING 
ACCORDING TO HIS CHRONICLERS 
FOR THE NAME OF JESUS AND THE PROTECTION OF THE CHURCH I'M READY TO EMBRACE DEATH 
THEN THANK GOD CAME THE COUP DE GRACE 
ANOTHER MAILED ARM ANOTHER DOWNWARD SLASH TO THE HEAD 
SO HARD THAT THE SWORD BLADE BROKE IN TWO ON THE STONES 
TO FINISH THE JOB A THIRD WARRIOR STOOD ON THE ARCHBISHOP'S NECK STUCK THE END OF HIS SWORD 
INTO THE OPEN CAVITY OF HIS SKULL SCOOPED OUT THE BRAINS 
AND SPREAD THEM ON THE FLOOR 
LET'S BE OFF HE SAID THIS FELLOW WON'T BE GETTING UP AGAIN 
IT WAS AROUND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY IN THE AFTERNOON 
THE DOOR WAS OPEN FRIGHTENED PEOPLE WHO HAD COME FOR THE SERVICE GATHERED ROUND THE BODY 
BUT IT WAS BY NO MEANS A FLOCK WHO THOUGHT BECKET WAS A SAINT HE WANTED TO BE A KING SAID ONE 
NOW LET HIM BE ONE 
BUT THEN IT ALL CHANGED 
BECKET'S CHAMBERLAIN REATTACHED THE BLEEDING SCALP TO HIS HEAD 
WITH A STRIP OF MATERIAL TORN FROM HIS OWN SHIRT 
AND THE MONKS BEGAN TO PREPARE BECKET'S BODY FOR BURIAL 
AND THEN THEY DISCOVERED WHAT NO ONE UNTIL THAT MOMENT HAD KNOWN 
THE HAIR SHIRT WITH LICE CRAWLING BUSILY IN IT 
THOMAS THE IMMOVABLE HAD BEEN THOMAS THE SELF MORTIFIER THOMAS THE HUMBLE 
THEY LET HIM LIE WASHED IN HIS OWN BLOOD 
AND OVER THE CLOTTING BODY LAID THE ARCHIEPISCOPAL GARMENTS 
BY CHANCE THERE WAS A MARBLE SARCOPHAGUS READY FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S BURIAL HERE IN THE CRYPT 
AND A SPACE TO LOWER IT INTO 
SO DOWN WENT BECKET ARRAYED IN THE FULL RIG 
THE DALMATIC THE PALLIUM THE COPE THE CHASUBLE THE ORB AND THE RING 
HE'D ALWAYS THOUGHT KIT MATTERED HAD THOMAS BECKET 
AND FOR JUST WHAT EXACTLY HAD BECKET LAID DOWN SOME WOULD SAY THROWN AWAY HIS LIFE 
SOME FANTASTIC NOTION ALREADY OUT OF DATE THAT THE CHURCH COULD LAY DOWN THE LAW TO THE STATE 
ALL OUR MODERN INSTINCTS SEEM TO SAY OH COME ON LOOK AT HENRY AND YOU FIND REALITY 
THE GUARDIAN OF THE COMMON LAW THE ENGINEER OF GOVERNMENT THE SMASHER OF ANARCHY 
AND YOU'D BE QUITE WRONG 
BECKET HEADSTRONG INFURIATING OVER THE TOP THEATRICAL BECKET MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE 
HIS VIEW OF THE CHURCH LASTED THE ANGEVIN EMPIRE DID NOT 
THE ACTUAL MURDERERS GOT OFF PRETTY LIGHTLY 
HIDING OUT IN YORKSHIRE EXCOMMUNICATED TOLD TO GO ON CRUSADE 
BUT THE REAL JUDGEMENT HENRY RESERVED FOR HIMSELF AND THE VERDICT WAS GUILTY AS CHARGED 
IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR HE MADE A PILGRIMAGE TO CANTERBURY WHERE BECKET'S BLOOD WAS SAID TO WORK MIRACLES 
OVER THE LAST MILES HENRY WALKED BAREFOOT IN A HAIR SHIRT AS BECKET HAD DONE FOUR YEARS EARLIER 
AT THE TOMB HE CONFESSED HIS SINS AND WAS WHIPPED BY THE MONKS 
HOWEVER TOUGH HIS PUNISHMENT THOUGH THE BLOOD WOULD NEVER WASH AWAY HENRY THE HERO OF THE COMMON LAW 
WILL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED AS THE BIGGEST OF ENGLAND'S CROWNED CRIMINALS 
THE MURDERER IN THE CATHEDRAL 
HENRY THE SECOND WOULD RULE FOR ANOTHER TWENTY YEARS LONG ENOUGH TO SEE HIS EMBRYONIC LEGAL SYSTEM 
GROW INTO A THRIVING NETWORK OF COURTS 
UP AND DOWN THE LAND THESE NEW COURTS WERE TO SETTLE NOT JUST THE USUAL DISPUTES OF BLOOD AND MAYHEM 
BUT ALL MANNER OF PAINFUL ROWS OVER INHERITANCES ESTATES AND PROPERTIES 
HOW IRONIC THEN THAT THE ONLY FAMILY THAT WOULD NOT ACCEPT THE KING'S JUSTICE WAS HIS OWN 
BECAUSE IF THERE WAS ONE PERSON WHO WAS LIKELY TO THINK OF THE KING NOT AS JUDGE BUT AS TRANSGRESSOR 
IT WAS HIS WIFE 
IT HAD BEEN TWENTY YEARS SINCE HENRY AND ELEANOR HAD BEEN PARTNERS IN BED AND IN GOVERNMENT 
SINCE THEN ELEANOR HAD HAD TO SUFFER THE HUMILIATION OF A STRING OF MISTRESSES 
WHAT TORMENTED HER WAS NOT BECKET'S SHRINE 
BUT THE SHRINE HENRY HAD BUILT TO HIS FAVOURITE MISTRESS ROSAMUND CLIFFORD 
BETRAYED AND ALIENATED ELEANOR TURNED HER FORMIDABLE ENERGY AND INTELLECT 
TO THE BUSINESS OF GETTING HER JUST DESSERTS THROUGH HER CHILDREN 
SHE DID EVERYTHING SHE COULD 
TO MAKE THEM FEEL THEIR FATHER WAS ROBBING THEM OF THEIR RIGHTFUL POWER AND DIGNITY 
THE SONS ROSE TO THE BAIT AND WHAT A BUNCH THEY WERE HENRY AND ELEANOR'S FOUR SONS 
THERE WAS YOUNG HENRY OFFICIALLY THE NEXT KING OF ENGLAND 
BUT IN REALITY STILL HAVING TO APPLY TO HIS FATHER FOR POCKET MONEY 
HE REBELLED ONLY TO END UP DYING OF DYSENTERY 
AND THEN THERE WAS GEOFFREY AS BRIGHT AND DEVIOUS AS HIS NAMESAKE GRANDFATHER 
GIVEN BRITTANY BUT THEN TRAMPLED TO DEATH BY A HORSE 
THIS LEFT RICHARD COEUR DE LION THE LIONHEART 
PHYSICALLY BRAVE CHIVALROUS AND BRUTALLY AMBITIOUS 
AND THE YOUNGEST JOHN VINDICTIVE SELF SERVING BUT UNDOUBTEDLY CLEVER 
HENRY SAW IN HIM PERHAPS THE ONLY PRINCE WHO COULD PROPERLY INHERIT THE GOVERNMENT 
BETWEEN THEM RICHARD AND JOHN MANAGED TO UNDO IN THEIR OWN SPECTACULAR WAYS 
NOT ONLY THE PROSPECTS OF THE KINGDOM 
BUT IN THE SPACE OF FIFTEEN YEARS THE ENTIRE EMPIRE THEIR FATHER HAD SO SKILFULLY CONSTRUCTED 
IT WAS ON RICHARD THAT ELEANOR PINNED HER HOPES 
SHE WAS EVEN PREPARED TO GO AS FAR AS TO ENCOURAGE AN ALLIANCE 
BETWEEN RICHARD AND HER HUSBAND'S BITTEREST ENEMY THE KING OF FRANCE 
SO IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE RICHARD DECLARED WAR ON HIS FATHER 
THIS TIME HENRY FACED DEFEAT FORCED TO WATCH AS HIS BARONS DEFECTED TO RICHARD 
THE BELEAGUERED HENRY HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO NEGOTIATE AND AGREE TERMS WHICH HUMBLED HIM BEFORE HIS OWN SON 
TO ONLOOKERS HE APPEARED TO EMBRACE RICHARD IN A KISS OF PEACE 
WHAT HE REALLY SAID WAS GOD SPARE ME LONG ENOUGH TO TAKE REVENGE ON YOU 
WHEN THE KING ASKED TO SEE THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO HAD JOINED RICHARD 
TO HIS HORROR THE FIRST ON THE LIST WAS HIS BELOVED SON JOHN 
FACED WITH THIS ULTIMATE TREACHERY HENRY READ NO MORE 
HE DIED TWO DAYS LATER IN HIS CASTLE AT CHINON SOME CHRONICLERS SAY OF A BROKEN HEART 
THE ONLY CHILD AT HIS DEATHBED WAS ONE OF HIS ILLEGITIMATE SONS 
THE OTHERS HE SAID WITH LEAR LIKE BITTERNESS ARE THE REAL BASTARDS 
A BARGE TOOK HIS BODY DOWN RIVER TO FONTEVRAULT ABBEY 
WHEN RICHARD FINALLY VIEWED THE TOMB IT IS SAID THAT BLOOD POURED FROM THE NOSTRILS OF THE CORPSE 
IN FACT WHEN HENRY THE SECOND DIED HERE AT CHINON IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE HARDLY ANYONE MOURNED 
IT SEEMS THAT MOST PEOPLE WERE OFF BREAKING OPEN BOTTLES 
TO CELEBRATE THE ACCESSION OF HIS SON RICHARD THE DARLING OF POPULAR FOLKLORE AND LEGEND 
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THEN COEUR DE LION HAD WON THE PUBLIC RELATIONS BATTLE WITH HIS FATHER 
HE WAS ALREADY THE SUPERSTAR OF THE DYNASTY 
TO PROVE IT TO SHOW THAT THE OLD REGIME HAD PASSED THAT A NEW GLAMOUR HAD ARRIVED 
RICHARD PUT ON A SHOW STOPPING CORONATION 
AS IF IN REVERIE OF CAMELOT HE HAD HIMSELF DRIPPING IN GOLD 
GOLDEN SWORD GOLDEN SPURS A GOLDEN CANOPY OVER HIS HEAD 
TO CELEBRATE THE NEW REIGN THE JEWS OF LONDON PRESENTED RICHARD WITH A SPECIAL GIFT 
A GESTURE THAT WAS IMMEDIATELY INTERPRETED BY THE POPULACE AS A SINISTER PLOT 
AND WHICH TRIGGERED A GENERAL MASSACRE 
RICHARD OF DEVIZES IN HIS CHRONICLE WAS THE FIRST TO USE THE WORD HOLOCAUSTUM 
TO DESCRIBE THE MASS MURDER OF ENGLAND'S JEWS 
TO HIS CREDIT KING RICHARD MADE STRONG EFFORTS TO FORBID THIS FIRST WAVES OF POGROMS 
THE PROBLEM WAS THAT HE WAS NEVER AROUND TO ENFORCE THINGS 
IT'S AN IRONY THE KING WHOSE STATUE STANDS OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT 
AND SO IS SUPPOSED TO PERSONIFY SOME SORT OF ELEMENTAL ENGLISHNESS 
SPENT LESS TIME IN THIS COUNTRY THAT ANY OTHER MONARCH 
THE THREE LIONS ON HIS COAT OF ARMS WERE PLANTAGANET LIONS 
THE CROSS OF SAINT GEORGE STOOD FOR AQUITAINE NOT ENGLAND 
EAGER TO DO GOD'S WORK RICHARD VANISHED TO THE HOLY LAND 
JOHN IMMEDIATELY SET HIMSELF UP AS A RIVAL 
CREATING A VIRTUAL STATE WITHIN A STATE COMPLETE WITH HIS OWN COURT AND MERCENARY ARMY 
IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY TWO WHEN NEWS ARRIVED OF RICHARD'S CAPTURE ON HIS WAY BACK FROM THE CRUSADE 
JOHN QUICKLY DECLARED HIS BROTHER DEAD AND HIMSELF KING 
ELEANOR WAS TORN TO PIECES BY THIS FRATRICIDAL STRUGGLE SHE'D BEEN BRED TO DO WHAT ANGEVINS DO BEST 
TO PRESIDE OVER GOVERNMENT TO MANIPULATE POLITICS 
BUT NOW SHE WAS PARALYSED BY THE TRAGEDY OF HER OWN FAMILY 
IN DESPERATION SHE TURNED TO THE HOLY FATHER TO WHOM SHE WROTE AN EXTRAORDINARY LETTER 
I ELEANOR QUEEN OF ENGLAND UNHAPPY MOTHER PITIED BY NO ONE 
HAVE ARRIVED AT THIS MISERABLE OLD AGE 
TWO SONS LIE IN DUST AND THEIR UNHAPPY MOTHER IS TORTURED BY THEIR MEMORY 
KING RICHARD IS IN IRONS HIS BROTHER JOHN RAVAGES THE KINGDOM WITH FIRE AND SWORD 
I KNOW NOT WHICH SIDE TO TAKE 
IF I LEAVE ENGLAND I ABANDON THE KINGDOM OF MY SON JOHN TORN BY CIVIL WAR 
IF I STAY I MAY NEVER SEE THE DEARLY BELOVED FACE OF MY SON RICHARD AGAIN 
THERE WAS NOTHING THE POPE COULD DO ABOUT HER PLIGHT 
MONEY HOWEVER COULD DO THE TRICK 
TWO YEARS AND THIRTY FOUR TONS OF GOLD LATER RICHARD WAS RANSOMED INTO FREEDOM 
BUT HIS KINGDOM WAS BANKRUPT 
THE COST OF ACTING OUT HEROIC WAR GAMES WAS MEASURED IN BLOOD AS WELL AS MONEY 
SHOWING CONTEMPT FOR THE DEFENDERS OF THE BESIEGED CASTLE BY STANDING IN FRONT OF THEM WITHOUT ARMOUR 
A LONE ARCHER'S BOLT FOUND THE JOIN BETWEEN RICHARD'S NECK AND HIS SHOULDER 
THE WOUND TURNED GANGRENOUS 
WITHIN TEN DAYS THE LIONHEART WAS DEAD A TRIUMPH OF DAREDEVIL ROMANCE OVER COMMON SENSE 
HIS BODY WAS LAID IN A TOMB AT THE FOOT OF HIS FATHER'S IN ANJOU 
THE HEART OF THE LIONHEART WAS TAKEN TO THE GREAT CATHEDRAL AT ROUEN IN NORMANDY 
WHICH SEEMS FITTING SINCE THIS CITY WAS ALWAYS MORE OF A CAPITAL TO RICHARD THAN LONDON 
HIS BROTHER JOHN WHO SUCCEEDED HIM WAS BURIED IN ENGLAND MOSTLY IN WORCESTER CATHEDRAL 
BECAUSE THE MONKS OF CRAXTON ABBEY HAD TAKEN CARE TO STEAL AWAY HIS ENTRAILS 
MAKING JOHN IN DEATH AS HE'D BEEN IN LIFE ONE IS TEMPTED TO SAY GUTLESS 
IT WAS AS A POLITICIAN THAT JOHN WAS MOST OBVIOUSLY A WRETCHED FAILURE 
UNDER HIS FATHER THE EMPIRE HAD BEEN SUSTAINED BY A SHREWD COMBINATION OF CHARISMA AND FEUDAL LOYALTY 
JOHN'S PROBLEM WAS HIS DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING THAT ANYONE WOULD EVER BE MORE THAN A FAIR WEATHER FRIEND 
SO HE RELIED ON BLACKMAIL AND EXTORTION 
THREATS TO THE BARONS RATHER THAN PROMISES 
ASSUMING DISLOYALTY HE ENDED UP GUARANTEEING IT 
SO WHEN JOHN NEEDED THE BARONS MOST WHEN NORMANDY WAS THREATENED BY THE FRENCH KING 
THEY WEREN'T THERE FOR HIM 
THE RESULT WAS A CATASTROPHIC DEFEAT 
THE LOSS OF NORMANDY RIPPED THE HEART OUT OF ANGEVIN POWER 
WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS A SECRET MEETING AT BURY SAINT EDMUNDS 
WITH ALL THE MAJOR NOBLES IN ENGLAND SWORN TO FORCE JOHN TO ACCEPT REFORM 
IT'S CERTAINLY TRUE THAT FROM DEFEAT SPRANG REBELLION 
AT SOME POINT THE BARONS DRAFTED A DOCUMENT 
THAT WENT WELL BEYOND FORCING JOHN TO STOP BEING VINDICTIVE 
PROPOSING INSTEAD A CATALOGUE OF THINGS THE KING WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DO 
IT WAS CALLED MAGNA CARTA 
ANYONE EXPECTING TO FIND IN IT SOME SORT OF PRIMITIVE CONSTITUTION 
IS GOING TO BE IN FOR A BIT OF A SHOCK WHEN THEY READ THE DETAILS 
THE LIBERTIES ENUMERATED HERE BOIL DOWN LARGELY TO TAX RELIEF FOR THE ARMOURED AND LANDED CLASSES 
BUT EVEN IF THE MAGNA CARTA IS FILLED WITH THE MOANS AND BELLY ACHING OF THE BARONS 
THAT BELLY ACHING TURNED OUT TO HAVE PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES FOR THE FUTURE OF ENGLAND 
FOR BY PUTTING SO MUCH WEIGHT ON THE AUTHORITY OF COMMON LAW 
THE ANGEVINS HAD STIRRED IN THE NOBILITY A DAWNING REALISATION THAT THIS WAS THEIR LAW TOO 
A GENERATION BEFORE THE BARONS COULDN'T HAVE CARED LESS 
ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF MEN HELD IN PRISON FOR UNSTATED CAUSES 
THAT WAS WHAT HAPPENED TO COMMONERS BUT UNDER JOHN BAD THINGS HAD HAPPENED TO THEM 
LAND STOLEN WIDOWS HOUNDED HEIRS MADE TO DISAPPEAR 
SO NOW WAS THE TIME TO USE THE WEAPONS HENRY THE SECOND'S REVOLUTION IN JUSTICE HAD PUT INTO THEIR HANDS 
AND BY AN AMAZING IRONY THE ANGEVINS BECAME THE SCHOOLMASTERS OF THEIR OWN CORRECTION 
HENRY THE SECOND'S TRANSFORMATION OF ROYAL JUSTICE HAD COME BACK TO BITE HIS OWN DYNASTY 
SO IF IT ISN'T EXACTLY THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE OF DEMOCRACY IT IS THE DEATH CERTIFICATE OF DESPOTISM 
IT SPELLS OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE 
THAT THE LAW IS NOT SIMPLY THE WILL OR THE WHIM OF THE KING 
THE LAW IS AN INDEPENDENT POWER UNTO ITSELF AND THE KING COULD BE BROUGHT TO BOOK FOR VIOLATING IT 
NONE OF THIS WAS APPARENT RIGHT AWAY TEN WEEKS AFTER MAGNA CARTA HAD BEEN SIGNED IT WAS ANNULLED BY THE POPE 
AND JOHN WENT BACK TO FIGHTING HIS BATTLES BY THE SWORD 
AGAINST THE REBEL BARONS AND AGAINST THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL INVASION BY A KING OF FRANCE 
FOR A FEW MONTHS IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN MUCH OF ENGLAND WAS RULED BY THE DAUPHIN 
JOHN DIED ON CAMPAIGN IN NORFOLK FACING THE WINDSWEPT WATERS OF THE WASH 
FIGHTING HAD QUICKENED HIS APPETITE AND HE ATE A MEAL SO HEARTY 
IT PAID HIM BACK WITH A FATAL SPASM OF DYSENTERY 
AS FOR THE BARONS OF ENGLAND THEY HAD NO APPETITE FOR CIVIL WAR MUCH LESS RULE FROM FRANCE 
SO WHEN JOHN'S NINE YEAR OLD SON WAS PROCLAIMED HENRY THE THIRD AT GLOUCESTER CATHEDRAL THEY RALLIED TO HIM 
BUT WHAT THEY WERE RALLYING TO WAS NOT SO MUCH A PERSON NOW AS A CONTRACT 
THE UNDERSTANDING GUARANTEED BY THE REISSUE OF THE CHARTER 
THAT FROM NOW ON THE GOVERNMENT OF ENGLAND HAD TO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE LAW 
THE RAMSHACKLE CONGLOMERATE OF THE ANGEVIN EMPIRE HAD FALLEN APART ALMOST AS QUICKLY AS IT HAD RISEN 
BUT IN THE ENGLAND TO WHICH IT WAS REDUCED SOMETHING SOLID WAS LEFT 
SOMETHING THAT'S BEST MEASURED NOT IN MASONRY OR MILEAGE 
BUT IN MAGISTRATES 
SO THE BEST THING THAT CAN BE SAID FOR THE ANGEVINS 
WAS THAT THEY LEFT BEHIND A COUNTRY THAT DIDN'T NEED THEM ANY MORE 
WHY HUNT FOR EXCALIBUR WHEN YOU HAD SOMETHING MUCH MORE POTENT MAGNA CARTA 
THERE'S MUCH MORE TO DISCOVER AND DEBATE ON THE B. B. C. HISTORY WEBSITE 
I AM MISTRESS OF ALL I SURVEY 
YOU THREW YOUR LIFE AWAY BECAUSE HE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND YOUR CLEVER WORDS AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE 
MY CLEVER WORDS WILL SOON BE THE ONLY THING PUTTING A ROOF OVER MY HEAD 
WHAT HAPPINESS I AM ALL ALONE 
OUT OF STEP AND AHEAD OF HER TIME 
THE ONLY WAY TO GET A MAN LIKE MR. DARCY IS TO MAKE HIM UP 
THE UNTOLD STORY OF A GREAT STORYTELLER 
THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS SOME STRONG LANGUAGE
