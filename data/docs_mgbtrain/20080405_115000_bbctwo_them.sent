HI I'M DEAN 
I'M SEVENTEEN AND I'M 
FOUR WORDS CRAZY EXCITING NOISY AND ADVENTUROUS 
IT'S WEIRD I DO WEAR MY HOOD UP A LOT OF THE TIME 
BUT I KNOW SOME PEOPLE FIND IT A THREAT 
I DON'T WEAR IT TO BE THREATENING I SUPPOSE IT'S A FASHION 
IT IS A FASHION 
PEOPLE WILL WEAR ANYTHING FASHIONABLE 
YOU WOULDN'T USUALLY GET SOMEONE FROM A COUNCIL ESTATE 
CALLING THEMSELVES A CHAV IT'S USUALLY USED AS AN INSULT 
LIKE YOU CHAV THEY'RE CHAVS 
I WOULDN'T DESCRIBE DEAN AS A HOODIE 
I KNOW THERE'S THIS WORD HOODIE 
IF YOU WEAR A HOODIE YOU'RE CLASSED AS A HOODIE 
PEOPLE GET THE WRONG IMPRESSION THAT THEY'RE TROUBLEMAKERS 
IT'S WEIRD I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW OF ANYONE THAT'S EVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
LIKE COMMITTED CRIMES OR THEFT 
IF YOU WERE TO GO ROUND HERE SAY YOU WALKED TO THE SHOP 
IT'D BE WEIRD SEEING SOMEONE DRESSED UP IN A SUIT OBVIOUSLY 
THAT'D BE COMPLETELY OUT OF PLACE IN MY SCHOOL WE HAD CERTAIN TRIBES 
WE HAD LIKE MOSHERS WHO WERE POSH PEOPLE IN MY SCHOOL 
THERE'S ONLY A COUPLE OF US FROM ROUND HERE 
IT'S WEIRD COS I'LL GO ROUND MY ESTATE THEN CHILL AT THEIR HOUSES 
AND THEY'LL HAVE LIKE A SIX BEDROOMED HOUSE 
IF I WAS A MILLIONAIRE WHAT WOULD I DO TO MY ROOM 
PROBABLY PAINT IT GOLD LOAD OF XBOXES BIG SCREEN 
I'D PROBABLY GET A BIG PROJECTOR UP ACROSS THERE 
KNOCK INTO NEXT DOOR'S AND USE THEIR HOUSE AS A WARDROBE AND JUST FILL IT WITH HOODIES 
HIP HOP GRIME RAP NICHE I LIKE THAT SORT OF MUSIC 
MY IMPRESSION OF GRIME MUSIC OBVIOUSLY I'M NO UP TO DATE 
IS VERY LOUD MUSIC BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I HEAR FROM THEIR BEDROOMS 
I DON'T THINK MY MUM'S TOO BOTHERED BY IT 
I USE MYSPACE A LOT FACEBOOK M. S. N. YOU CAN SEND SONGS OVER THAT 
IF THERE'S ANY NEW SONGS THAT ARE BIG GET THEM SENT TO YOU WITH THAT 
CLICK TROUBLESUM YOUTZ GROUP OF MATES GOT TOGETHER 
PICKED UP A MICROPHONE STARTED WRITING THEIR OWN LYRICS AND STORIES 
RECORDED IT AND BASICALLY STARTED MOVING FROM THERE 
WE JUST MEET UP AND DO A TRACK EVERY SO OFTEN 
RAPS YOUR BARS JUST DON'T GET TO ME LIKE I WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN 
I'M A VIRUS LIKE TROJAN ATTACK YOUR BRAIN 
WHATEVER I SAY GETS HEARD COS I GOT THE WORDS OF A SPOKESMAN 
I CARRY WEIGHT LIKE SUMO PUT YOU TO THE GROUND LIKE JUDO 
I'M SO HOT LIKE THE SUN BUT COMPARED TO ME YOU'RE LIKE PLUTO 
YOU'RE SO FAR AWAY YOU BURN EASY LIKE TOAST 
YOU CAN'T TOUCH ME THAT'S WHY THEY CALL ME GHOST 
I BRING BEEF TO THE TABLE LIKE A SUNDAY ROAST 
THAT LINE THEN YOU CAN'T TOUCH ME THAT'S WHY THEY CALL ME GHOST 
THIS IS THE LADS THIS IS TROUBLESUM 
IT'S WEIRD COS WE MET THROUGH LIKE GRIME MUSIC 'N THAT 
WE LIVE SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER 'N THAT 
IT'S ALL RIGHT WE GO AND MAKE TRACKS WHENEVER WE WANT 'N THAT 
I WANNA GET SOMEWHERE DEFINITELY 
FAR AS POSSIBLE 
BUT IT'S HARD TO GET NOTICED YEAH IT IS 
THIS MIGHT HELP WE'RE JUST STREET ARTISTS MAN 
WE DRESS LIKE THIS BUT IT DON'T MEAN WE ARE SCUM KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
IT'S JUST OLD PEOPLE INNIT MAN 
WE'RE JUST KIDS LIKE THEY WERE SO WHY SHOULD THEY BE SCARED JUST COS WE'RE WEARING A HOODIE 
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S COLD KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
A BASIC CHAV YEAH IS WHEN HE TAKES IT OVER THE TOP TUCKS IT IN 
KNOW WHAT I MEAN THAT'S A CHAV 
THAT'S A CHAV 
WE WRITE ABOUT EVERYTHING WE WRITE ABOUT GIRLS LIFE STORIES 
ANYTHING COME UP WITH LOADS OF PUNCH LINES DON'T WE 
THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS 
THIS IS MY AREA 
YOU USUALLY FIND ME AND MY MATES CHILLING ROUND HERE 
ROUND THE YOUTH CLUB ROUND THE ESTATE AND ROUND EACH OTHER'S HOUSES 
IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO PLAY A BIT OF FIFA 
THIS IS THE YOUTH CENTRE 
ME AND MY MATES COME HERE GET TOGETHER HAVE A SET 
PLAY A BIT OF FOOTBALL IN THE COURTS JUST DO OUR THING 
TELL THE B. B. C. CREW 
BEFORE WE GO ON STAGE YOU GET A BIT OF BUTTERFLIES 
BUT ONCE YOU PICK UP THE MIC YOU JUST CAN'T STOP YOU LOVE IT 
AFTER YOU'VE DONE A BIT OF A SET YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT FRAME OF MIND 
TO GO HOME AND SIT DOWN WITH A PEN AND A PAD 
AND YOU CAN WRITE FOR AGES ABOUT ANYTHING 
INDECIPHERABLE RAP 
WHEN I M. C. IT'S I'M SORT OF LIKE A DIFFERENT PERSON 
BUT I'LL TELL STORIES THAT HAVE HAPPENED OR TRUE STORIES 
INDECIPHERABLE RAP 
IF I WAS GONNA GO SHOPPING I'D PROBABLY GO TO THE TRAFFORD CENTRE 
AND GO ROUND JJB SPORTS WORLD AND PLACES LIKE THAT 
I'D PROBABLY GO STRAIGHT TO THE TRAINERS AND LOOK AT THE NEW ONES 
THEY'RE CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND GETTING DEARER 
SOMETIMES I'D GO TO NEXT AND BUY A NICE CARDIGAN OR SOMETHING 
THE MOST I'VE SPENT ON AN ITEM IS PROBABLY ABOUT EIGHTY 
I DON'T ACTUALLY TEND TO WEAR STUFF LIKE THIS MUCH 
EVEN THOUGH IT'S SOME OF THE DEARER ITEMS IN MY WARDROBE 
YOU KNOW E. WEAR CLOTHES I WOULDN'T SUIT THAT 
WITH THIS SHORT HAIR AND STUFF 
I HAVE CALLED HIM BACK IN THE HOUSE A FEW TIMES BUT THAT WAS LAST YEAR 
WHEN THEY WORE THEIR PANTS REALLY PULLED DOWN 
WITHIN REASON I LET HIM CHOOSE HIS OWN FASHION SENSE SO HE CAN BE WHO HE WANTS TO BE REALLY 
AT THE MOMENT I'M JUST WORKING PART TIME AND MARKS AND SPENCER 
I'M HOPING TO GO INTO THE R. A. F. 
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO GO THERE FOR A FEW YEARS I'VE JUST HAD A YEAR OFF COS I WASN'T QUITE THE RIGHT AGE 
HE SAID IF I WAS IN YOUR SITUATION I'D WAIT IT'S WORTH IT 
I DIDN'T WANT TO STAY ON AT COLLEGE 
IT'S NOT THAT I DIDN'T LIKE SCHOOL I JUST WANTED TO GET WORKING AND THAT 
THE COMMUNITY ROUND HERE'S A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP 
YOU CAN WALK DOWN THE ROAD AND KNOCK ON ANYONE'S DOOR AND HAVE A CHAT 
IF SOMEONE'S THE SAME AGE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ESTATE YOU PRETTY MUCH KNOW THEM 
I SUPPOSE WE'RE CLOSE COS WE ALL LIVE IN THE SAME SITUATION 
CHAV IS MORE OF AN INSULT 
HE'S A CHAV YOU SEE IT IN THE NEWSPAPERS ALL THE TIME 
CHAVS ARE VIOLENT AND ALL THAT 
HOODIES ARE MORE LIKE JUST US 
I LOVE BEING A HOODIE COS I LOVE GRIME MUSIC 
I LOVE THE LAID BACK STYLE I'M ONE OF THEM I'M DEAN
