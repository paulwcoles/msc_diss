MORE TOP STORIES NOW A NINETEEN YEAR 
OLD MAN HAS BEEN ARRESTED OVER 
FEARS HE MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN 
TERRORISM POLICE TOLD THIRTY PEOPLE TO 
LEAVE NEARBY HOUSES AND THEN 
CARRIED OUT AN EXPLOSION ON 
SOMETHING THEY FOUND INSIDE THE 
MAN'S HOME 
AND POLICE OFFICERS IN AMERICA 
EXPECT TO COME ACROSS THE ODD BAD 
DRIVER WHEN THEY'RE OUT ON THE 
STREETS BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS 
HITCHING A RIDE IN THIS CAR WAS A 
SIX F. T. LONG ALLIGATOR POLICE DIDN'T 
TRY TO ARREST THE REPTILE THEY 
CALLED IN EXPERTS WHO SAFELY TOOK 
IT AWAY 
AND THIS GOLDFISH IN KENT HAS LEFT 
EXPERTS BOWLED OVER BY HIS 
INCREDIBLE SIZE GOLDIE WAS JUST 
TWO FIVE C. M. LONG WHEN HIS OWNER ADA SHAW 
BOUGHT HIM FOR NINETY NINE P. BUT HE'S NOW 
GROWN TO A WHOPPING THIRTY SIX C. M. LONG AND 
IT'S AMAZING HE STAYS AFLOAT HE 
WEIGHS ALMOST AS MUCH AS A LAPTOP 
COMPUTER 
NEXT TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR SCHOOL 
UNIFORM I BET THERE'S A BADGE ON 
THERE BUT IS IT THE KIND OF THING 
THAT BELONGS IN ONE OF J. K. ROWLING'S 
BOOKS THAT'S THE LOGO OF WARBOYS 
COMMUNITY PRIMARY SCHOOL IN 
CAMBRIDGESHIRE BUT NOT FOR MUCH 
LONGER THEY'VE DECIDED TO DITCH 
THE WITCH BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED 
IT'S PUTTING PEOPLE OFF HERE'S 
HELEN 
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT HAVING A 
WITCH ON YOUR SCHOOL LOGO THAT IS 
WHAT THE KIDS HERE HAVE GOT AT 
WARBOYS COMMUNITY PRIMARY IT IS 
CAUSING A BIT OF A STIR THE REASON 
THERE ARE SYMBOLS OF WHICH IS ALL 
OVER THIS VILLAGE IS BECAUSE IT WAS 
THE LAST PLACE IN ENGLAND TO KILL 
PEOPLE ACCUSED OF WITCHCRAFT THERE 
HAS BEEN A WITCH ON THE SCHOOL LOGO 
FOR MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS BUT NOW 
THEY WANT TO SCRAP IT THE SCHOOL 
THINKS IT IS PUTTING PEOPLE OFF 
COMING HERE 
LOCAL PEOPLE ARE VERY PASSIONATE 
ABOUT THEIR LOCAL ISSUE AND 
RIGHTLY SO THEIR LOCAL HISTORY 
IT IS NOT ABOUT THAT IT IS ABOUT 
THE SCHOOL AND MOVING IT FORWARD 
IN A NEW DIRECTION AND GIVING 
CHILDREN THE BEST EDUCATION BUT BUT LOTS OF PEOPLE DISAGREE THEY HAVE 
STARTED A PETITION TO SAVE THE LOGO 
IT IS A TOTAL WASTE OF SCHOOL FUNDS 
IN OUR OPINION THEY SHOULD BE 
CONCENTRATING ON OTHER THINGS THIS 
IS NOT A TOP PRIORITY IT'S PART OF 
THE HERITAGE IT IS SO DEEPLY 
INGRAINED IN OUR COMMUNITY THE 
WITCH IS USED ON THE CLOCK TOWER 
IT IS USED FOR THE SPORTS CLUBS 
IT'S PART OF THE HISTORY 
SO WOULD WEARING A WITCH TO SCHOOL 
FREAK YOU OUT DO I KNOW DOES 
MATTER THAT MUCH LET US KNOW WHAT 
YOU THINK TO LOGOS MATTER

MISSED ANYTHING SO FAR HERE IS HOW 
THINGS HAVE GONE SO FAR 
EVERY WEEK THE BOYS TOOK ON THE 
GIRLS AFTER A CRASH COURSE IN A 
BRAND NEW SPORT TRAINING WAS TOUGH 
AT TIMES BUT EACH WEEK THE 
COMPETITION WAS TENSE ESPECIALLY 
IN WEEK SIX WHEN EVEN CERTAIN 
SPORTS ROUND PRESENTERS DECIDED 
THEY HAD TO GET IN ON THE ACT THIS THIS IS DISASTROUS FOR GAVIN 
IT STARTED 
WITH A WIN FOR THE GIRLS IN TRACK 
CYCLING BUT THE BOYS BOUNCED BACK 
AND MOVED INTO THE LEAD THEN THREE 
VICTORIES IN A ROW FOR THE GIRLS 
PUT THEM IN FRONT ONLY FOR THE 
BOYS TO RACE BACK AND TAKE WEEKS NINE 
AND TEN TO LEVEL THINGS UP NOW 
AFTER TEN WEEKS OF COMPETITION IT 
IS ALL TO PLAY FOR

DOWN TO TOMORROW

WHO ARE MORE SPORTY GIRLS OR BOYS 
I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE RECORD 
OF WINS AND OLYMPIC MEDALS RECENTLY 
KELLY HOLMES AND DENISE LEWIS 
WHOM I MET THEY HAVE DONE SO MUCH 
GOOD FOR BRITISH SPORT BUT I THINK 
A ROUND THE WORLD PEOPLE THINK 
GIRLS DO REALLY WELL

BELIEVE IT EVEN THE TOP MAN HAS 
DECIDED TO GET INVOLVED AND HE HAS 
GONE FOR THE GIRLS 
HE WILL BE 
TUNING IN TOMORROW MORNING AND

AM GOING FOR THE BOYS HOW ABOUT
