AND THERE IS A REAL SENSE OF IDENTIFICATION 
NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED BRITISH JEWS LEFT THE U. K. 
TO BECOME CITIZENS OF ISRAEL LAST YEAR 
THEY ALONG WITH JEWS AROUND THE WORLD 
HAVE AN AUTOMATIC RIGHT TO GO AND LIVE IN WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS THEIR PROMISED LAND 
THE JOURNEY IS CALLED MAKING ALIYAH 
WE'RE COMING HOME 
IT'S A FEELING LIKE NO OTHER 
YOU DO FEEL SPECIAL YOU DO FEEL THAT THIS IS WHERE YOU BELONG 
FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS WE PRAYED FOR A RETURN AND NOW THERE IS A CHANCE FOR US ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY TO RETURN 
FOR MANY MAKING ALIYAH IS A SPIRITUAL HOMECOMING 
THE FULFILMENT OF A RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL DREAM THE HEART OF ZIONISM 
BUT THE BELIEFS BEHIND ALIYAH AND THE PREFERENTIAL RIGHTS OF CITIZENSHIP THAT COME WITH IT 
HAVE RAISED BIG MORAL QUESTIONS FOR SOME BRITISH JEWS 
A PALESTINIAN WHOSE FAMILY MAY HAVE LIVED THERE FOR TEN GENERATIONS 
HAS NO SUCH RIGHT 
AND CAN SUCH A SOCIETY REALLY BE FAIR 
JEWS COME HERE 
WITH THIS EMOTIONAL TIE TO ISRAEL 
WHICH OVERCOMES RATIONAL LOGICAL THINKING 
AND IT'S INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS 
RIGHT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS FOLD ALTERNATELY THE BLUE SERVIETTES 
AND THE RED SERVIETTES 
THE UNITED FANS AND THE CITY FANS WILL BE HAPPY 
YONATAN COHEN WHO GREW UP IN MANCHESTER'S ORTHODOX JEWISH COMMUNITY 
PLANS TO MAKE ALIYAH THIS SUMMER 
KIDS LIKE THE CHOCOLATE AND JAM AND THE ADULTS LIKE THE DATES I AM NOT SO RELIGIOUS MYSELF 
I AM TRADITIONALLY AN ORTHODOX JEW 
I DO FOLLOW A LOT OF THE LAWS 
AND I DO FEEL VERY JEWISH 
THEN WE NEED TO MAKE SOME SQUASH THE CULTURE AND THE TRADITIONS AND STUFF IS ALSO WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO ME 
I'LL TAKE THE PLATES OVER THERE YOU PUT THE KNIVES AND FORKS HERE 
YONATAN'S TWENTY TWO JUST OUT OF UNIVERSITY 
AND LOOKING FORWARD TO STARTING A NEW LIFE IN TEL AVIV THIS SUMMER 
WE'RE QUITE HAPPY ABOUT YONATAN GOING BACK GOING TO LIVE IN ISRAEL 
IT'LL BE NICE COS HIS OLDER BROTHER IS GOING AGAIN LATER ON IN THE YEAR 
AND WE ALSO WILL BE GOING BACK SOME TIME IN AUGUST TO SETTLE THERE 
HAVING LIVED HERE FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS 
SO WE'LL ALL BE TOGETHER AGAIN TO LIVE AS A FAMILY 
SHE'S LIKE EVERY JEWISH MOTHER 
SHE LIKES TO GET INVOLVED TELLING ME EXACTLY WHAT TO DO 
WHAT I'M DOING WRONG WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT 
SHE'LL BE ON HAND 
I'LL MISS HER FOR A MONTH AND THEN SHE'LL BE TELLING ME WHAT TO DO 
MOST PEOPLE SAY THEY FEEL THEY'RE GOING HOME BECAUSE THAT IS THEIR HOMELAND 
THERE'S A SENSE OF IDEALISM BECAUSE I'VE HAD A VERY ZIONIST EDUCATION 
I'VE BEEN TO JEWISH SCHOOLS ALL MY LIFE 
I'VE BEEN TO JEWISH YOUTH MOVEMENTS 
JEWISH WORKERS ARE BUSY BUILDING NEW SETTLEMENTS THE SO CALLED KIBBUTZ 
WE GET TAUGHT ABOUT WHAT IT TOOK TO BUILD THE STATE AND THAT MAKES IT MORE EMOTIONAL 
WHEN YOU REALISE THAT YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY 
AND PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW HAVE HELPED OR HAVE DIED 
ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS WHICH HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE STATE 
BARBED WIRE IS CARRIED TO THE OUTPOSTS 
A REMINDER OF THE WAR LIKE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THIS WORK IS DONE 
I DO FEEL PART OF IT AND I FEEL THAT GOING TO ISRAEL IS WHERE I WOULD BELONG 
EVEN THOUGH I ENJOY LIVING IN ENGLAND 
AND IN A VERY SMALL JEWISH COMMUNITY THAT I'M USED TO AND WE'RE VERY CLOSE 
DOESN'T SPEAK HEBREW AT ALL 
IF YOU LIVE IN A CITY EVERYBODY SPEAKS ENGLISH 
ARE YOU GONNA DO ARMY SERVICE I'D BE SCARED ABOUT THAT 
BECAUSE IT'S SO PART OF LIFE OUT THERE IT'S NOT EVEN LIKE 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WOULD PUT ME OFF MAKING ALIYAH 
I DON'T WANT TO BUT IF I HAVE TO THEN I WILL 
YOU'D BE MORE ACCEPTED BY THE ISRAELIS 
I THINK MY MAIN HINDRANCE IN MAKING ALIYAH IS MY KIDS FIGHTING IN THE ARMY 
I DON'T THINK I'D COPE KNOWING THAT MY KIDS ARE OUT ON THE FRONT LINE 
IN THEORY IT'S GREAT I'M ZIONIST 
I WANT MY KIDS TO GO AND FIGHT FOR ISRAEL JUST LIKE OUR ANCESTORS DID 
SOME THINGS YOU WANT TO FIGHT FOR THOUGH 
BUT THEN IF YOU ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT IT IN PRACTICALITIES COULD YOU LET YOUR KID GO AND DO IT 
COULD YOU BE ON THE EDGE FOR THREE YEARS AT A TIME 
THIS IS A GIRL'S PERSPECTIVE I'D NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT 
GUYS DON'T THINK ABOUT IT 
I THINK THAT'S BEEN ONE OF MY MAIN HINDRANCES 
NOT WANTING MY KIDS TO GO AND FIGHT IN THE ARMY 
I'D BE TERRIFIED 
I THINK MY MAIN HINDRANCE IS NOT WANTING ME TO GO FIGHT IN THE ARMY 
VERY SELFISH 
MOST OF YONATAN'S FRIENDS ARE JEWISH 
LIKE HIM THEY'VE SPENT HOLIDAYS AND GAP YEARS IN ISRAEL 
AND UNDERSTAND THE ATTRACTION 
I THINK THE RELIGIOUS ASPECT IS A BIT OF IT 
PROBABLY NOT THE MAIN DRIVING FORCE BEHIND IT 
COS EVERYONE'S BEEN THERE ON HOLIDAYS LOVED THE WAY OF LIFE AND WANT TO LIVE OUT THERE 
IT'S MORE SPIRITUAL THAN RELIGIOUS THOUGH ISN'T IT YEAH DEFINITELY 
IT'S A FEELING YOU GET WHEN YOU'RE THERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ORTHODOX TO FEEL THAT 
I MEAN I ONLY HAVE A FEW ORTHODOX FRIENDS WHO HAVE MOVED THERE 
IT'S THE FEELING YOU GET OF BEING A PART OF A BIGGER INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
YOU GO FROM BEING A MINORITY TO BEING IN THE MAJORITY 
THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE HERE TO KEEP UP WITH THE RELIGION 
AND DO ACTIVITIES 
WHEREAS EVERYTHING YOU DO OUT THERE IT'S PART OF IT 
I THINK HE'LL JUST BE IMMERSED IN IT RATHER THAN TRYING TO FIND IT 
AROUND A QUARTER OF A MILLION JEWS LIVE IN BRITAIN 
WITH THE BIGGEST COMMUNITIES IN LONDON GLASGOW AND MANCHESTER 
THAT'S GOT SEEDS IN THAT'S NOT THAT'S JUST PLAIN 
VIEWS HERE ON ZIONISM AND ALIYAH ARE DIVIDED 
ONE SURVEY SUGGESTS AROUND HALF OF BRITISH JEWS REGARD THEMSELVES AS ZIONIST 
DISSENTERS INCLUDE THE STRICT ULTRA ORTHODOX 
A GROWING GROUP WHO BELIEVE GATHERING IN ISRAEL IS WRONG 
BECAUSE IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO FORCE GOD'S HAND TO HASTEN THE COMING OF THE MESSIAH 
ANYTHING ELSE 
BUT FOR MANY WHO DO BELIEVE THAT ALIYAH IS A RETURN TO THE PROMISED LAND 
IT'S A FULFILMENT OF A BIBLICAL PROMISE TO GOD'S CHOSEN PEOPLE 
THE LAND OF ISRAEL IS THE PLACE WHERE THE BIBLE SAYS THAT JEWS SHOULD LIVE 
AND THE LAND THAT WAS PROMISED BY GOD 
TO ABRAHAM ISAAC AND JACOB AND LATER TO MOSES 
AND JOSHUA LED THE PEOPLE INTO ISRAEL 
AND WE LIVED THERE FOR HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF YEARS DURING THE BIBLICAL PERIOD 
THE JEWS IN THEIR PRAYERS AND IN THEIR PASSOVER CEREMONIES 
HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT THEY WANT TO GO BACK TO LIVE IN ISRAEL 
WE PRAY THREE TIMES A DAY FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE BIBLICAL KINGDOM 
AND FOR THE REBUILDING OF JERUSALEM 
THERE'S ALWAYS HAS BEEN THIS IMPERATIVE AND MOTIVATION TO GO AND LIVE THERE 
BRITAIN'S JEWISH COMMUNITY THOUGH RELATIVELY SMALL IS ENJOYING A PERIOD OF CULTURAL RENEWAL 
FOR MANY MODERN ORTHODOX BRITISH JEWS RELIGIOUS OR NOT 
THERE IS A DEEP SENSE OF CONNECTION WITH ISRAEL 
COLIN SHINDLER IS A LEADING AUTHORITY ON ZIONISM 
THERE IS AN EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT 
ISRAEL LITERALLY EMERGED OUT OF THE ASHES OF THE HOLOCAUST 
AND THERE IS A REAL SENSE OF IDENTIFICATION 
FOR RELIGIOUS JEWS WHO READ ABOUT JERUSALEM WHO READ ABOUT ANCIENT ISRAEL 
WHO CAN SEE THE BIBLE IN A SENSE COMING TO LIFE AT LEAST IN THEIR TERMS 
THERE'S A PROFOUND DEPTH OF EMOTION WHICH MOTIVATES THEM 
AND ALIYAH OF COURSE MEANS GOING UP 
YOU'RE GOING TO SOMEWHERE BETTER 
AND IT'S ALSO ABOUT BEING IN THE MAJORITY FOR ONCE 
HI MUM 
MARC AND MIRIAM KAYE ARE PACKING UP THEIR NORTH LONDON HOME GETTING READY TO MAKE ALIYAH 
WE'RE BOTH RELIGIOUS JEWS 
WE'RE MODERN ORTHODOX JEWS WE ARE ZIONIST JEWS 
TOGETHER WITH THEIR DAUGHTER ODELIA THEY'RE LEAVING FOR JERUSALEM IN A FEW DAYS 
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN A LIFELONG IDEAL 
AND SOMETHING THAT'S SO DIFFICULT TO DO 
BOTH PRACTICALLY PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY 
THIS IS GOING TO CHARITY I'M ASSUMING 
PLEASE 
I'D REALLY LIKE TO KEEP IT 
FOR US THE IDEA OF JEWISHNESS MEANS 
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE HEBREW AS OUR FIRST LANGUAGE 
RATHER THAN AS MINORITY LANGUAGE THAT WE OCCASIONALLY USE 
WE'RE GOING TO BE CELEBRATING JEWISH FESTIVALS AS NATIONAL FESTIVALS RATHER THAN HAVING THE DIFFICULTY 
TO TAKE WORK OFF AND LEAVE EARLY AND YOU KNOW 
WE'VE HAD TO LEAVE SCHOOL EARLY EVERY FRIDAY FOR OUR WHOLE LIVES 
AND THAT WAS ALWAYS VERY DIFFICULT 
ALSO JUST THE WHOLE CULTURE 
JEWISH LIFE BEING MUCH EASIER OUT THERE LIVING WITH A MAJORITY JEWISH CULTURE 
KOSHER FOOD AVAILABLE ON EVERY STREET CORNER IT'S JUST GOING TO BE AN AMAZING NOVELTY 
AND LEAVING ANTI SEMITISM IN BRITAIN BEHIND WILL BE A BONUS 
TWO OR THREE INCIDENTS A YEAR JUST HAVE ALWAYS GIVEN ME A SENSE THAT 
AS BRITISH AS I HAVE ALWAYS FELT 
AND AS INTEGRATED AS I'VE BEEN HERE 
THERE'S BEEN THIS UNDERLYING NOTION THAT I'M NOT WELCOME HERE 
AND THAT'S BEEN VERY HARD 
THE KAYES ARE RELOCATING WITH THE HELP OF NEFESH B'NEFESH 
A GROUP WHICH PROMOTES JEWISH IMMIGRATION TO ISRAEL AND HELPS PEOPLE MAKE THE TRANSITION 
WORLDWIDE ALIYAH HAS BEEN IN STEADY DECLINE FOR NEARLY A DECADE 
AT THE SAME TIME THE NUMBERS OF ISRAELIS LEAVING THE COUNTRY ARE GROWING 
BUT ALIYAH FROM THE U. K. HAS INCREASED OVER THE SAME PERIOD 
PEAKING SINCE NEFESH B'NEFESH BEGAN RECRUITING HERE TWO YEARS AGO 
SO FAR IT'S HELPED ALMOST SIX HUNDRED BRITISH JEWS MOVE TO ISRAEL 
ON SPECIALLY CHARTERED FLIGHTS 
EVEN THOUGH WE THOUGHT WE WERE PREPARED THERE WAS A HECK OF A LOT TO DO 
BUT WE MADE IT AND WE'RE JUST SO EXCITED IT'S ACTUALLY AMAZING 
IT IS 
I KNEW AND I'D HEARD IT WAS GOING TO BE TRAUMATIC 
IT WAS MORE I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU THAN I DON'T WANT TO GO 
THEY WANT ME TO GO AS WELL 
EVEN MY GRANDMA 
SHE'S A HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR AND TRIED TO GO OVER TO WHAT WAS THEN PALESTINE IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE 
AND IT WAS A DREAM SHE NEVER REALISED 
I FEEL LIKE I'M FULFILLING PART OF THE FAMILY DREAM 
IT REALLY FELT THAT THE SUN WAS RISING ON OUR NEW LIFE THAT WAS ABOUT TO START 
AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU SEE THE COAST AND YOU'RE FLYING OVER A CITY AND THINKING THIS IS IT 
THIS IS US COMING HOME 
SEEING ALL THE SOLDIERS WITH THE FLAGS 
AND JUST PEOPLE COMING UP TO US AND GIVING US BLESSINGS AND WELCOME 
AND WISHING US MAZELTOV CONGRATULATIONS 
IT WAS VERY SPECIAL VERY SPECIAL 
IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING HOW VARIED THE PEOPLE WERE 
THERE WAS A WHOLE SPECTRUM OF AGES MALES FEMALES COUPLES FAMILIES 
AND IN TERMS OF RELIGIOUSNESS AS WELL IT ALSO SEEMED TO BE QUITE MIXED 
WE REALLY BELIEVE IN THE IDEA OF A FREE JEWISH PEOPLE IN OUR HOMELAND 
AND WE WANTED TO COME HERE AND BE A PART OF THAT 
I THINK ONLY OTHER ISRAELI OR ONLY OTHER JEWISH PEOPLE KNOW HOW YOU FEEL INSIDE 
BECAUSE YOU'RE A MINORITY OVER THERE AND OVER HERE EVERYONE IS JEWISH 
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IT'S JUST A FEELING LIKE NO OTHER 
IT'S THE HOMELAND 
WE NEEDED WE THOUGHT THAT THE COMING HOME WAS GOOD 
AND AS A BIG FAMILY WE DECIDED TO DO IT ALL TOGETHER 
HERE GOES 
WE MADE IT 
TO ARRIVE HAS A GREAT EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL IMPACT ON BOTH OF US 
I THINK IT'S ADDED GREATLY TO OUR SENSE OF HAPPINESS AND GRATITUDE EVEN 
IN THE FEW HOURS THAT WE'VE BEEN HERE 
THERE IS A SENSE OF COMING CLOSER TO OUR FAITH CLOSER TO OUR GOD 
HAVING A DEEPER ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR VALUES AND WHAT WE FEEL 
IS IMPORTANT AND HOPING TO LIVE A LIFE WHERE WE CAN PLAY THOSE OUT 
I FEEL DEEPLY SADDENED 
BY THE FACT THAT ONCE I COME HERE AND BECOME AN ISRAELI 
NOT ONLY DO I FEEL WELCOMED AND SETTLED AS A JEWISH PERSON HERE 
BUT I KNOW THAT I WILL IMMEDIATELY BE HATED BY SOME OF OUR NEIGHBOURS 
AND I FIND THAT VERY VERY DIFFICULT 
BUT THROUGH MY WORK WHICH IS IN INTERFAITH RELATIONS 
I DO HOPE TO ENGAGE IN SOME PROJECTS PERSONALLY AND ALSO PROFESSIONALLY 
GETTING HERE IS IN A WAY OUR FIRST STAGE 
BUT OUR MOST IMPORTANT STAGE BECAUSE ONCE WE'RE HERE WE FEEL LIKE NOW IT ALL BEGINS 
NOW THE CHALLENGES ARE UPON US WE CAN'T EXPECT OURSELVES TO MAKE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
BUT WE WILL CERTAINLY DO OUR LITTLE BIT TOWARDS THAT 
THE AUTHORITIES HERE ARE CONVINCED THE BOMBER WAS BRITISH 
IT WAS A SAD SICK HORRIFIC EVENT 
FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS AFTER WHICH 
UM I WAS COMPLETELY KNOCKED OUT AND I COULDN'T DO A THING 
WORK SOCIAL THINGS 
UM EXERCISE IT JUST BASICALLY KNOCKS YOU OUT 
THE TOXIC EFFECTS FROM THE BLAST 
IN TWO THOUSAND THREE MIKE'S PLACE A MUSIC BAR IN TEL AVIV WAS BOMBED 
THREE DIED FIFTY WERE INJURED 
ANDY GROSS WAS IN THE BAR THAT NIGHT VISITING HIS BROTHER WHO LIVES IN ISRAEL 
ANDY HAD MADE ALIYAH IN TWO THOUSAND BUT CAME BACK TO BRITAIN AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS 
LIKE MANY EX PATS HE FOUND HE COULDN'T MAKE ENDS MEET IN ISRAEL 
BUT THE ECONOMY AND THE VIOLENCE HAVEN'T PUT HIM OFF 
THE FACT THAT YEAH I WAS A METRE FROM BEING BLOWN UP 
DOESN'T DETER ME 
IN FACT IT STRENGTHENS MY RESOLVE THAT IT'S WHERE I WANT TO BE 
SOMETHING INSIDE ME SAYS THAT I SHOULD BE THERE 
DESPITE WHATEVER IT THROWS AT ME 
BACK IN ENGLAND FOR NOW HE'S WRITING AND PERFORMING MUSIC 
HE'S DETERMINED TO GO BACK TO LIVE IN ISRAEL AGAIN ONE DAY 
SPIRITUALITY IS A BIG PART OF MY LIFE AND I FEEL MORE SPIRITUAL 
I FEEL THAT MY SPIRIT IS BETTER NOURISHED AND MORE NOURISHED IN ISRAEL THAN IT IS HERE IN ENGLAND 
NUMBER THERE ARE SOME THINGS NOBODY WANTS TO SEE 
I KIND OF PERSONALLY THINK THAT ALL JEWS PERHAPS SHOULD BE IN ISRAEL 
LIVING IN ISRAEL IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMMANDMENTS YOU CAN ACTUALLY FULFIL IN YOUR LIFE 
JUST TO ACTUALLY LIVE THERE AND EVEN MORE SO THAT EVERY SEVEN STEPS EVERY SEVEN PACES 
YOU TAKE INSIDE THE COUNTRY YOU'RE ACTUALLY PERFORMING A MITZVAH ONE OF GOD'S COMMANDMENTS 
I WILL LIVE OUT MOST OF THE REST OF MY LIFE THERE 
SUSAN NATHAN ALSO MADE ALIYAH LEAVING LONDON IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE 
FULL OF ZIONIST IDEALISM SHE SETTLED IN TEL AVIV TO WORK AS AN ENGLISH TEACHER 
HI 
A FEW MONTHS LATER CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT SHE SAW AS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ISRAELI ARABS 
SHE LEFT TEL AVIV AND MOVED TO TAMRA IN THE NORTH OF ISRAEL 
BECOMING THE ONLY JEW IN A TOWN OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ARABS 
ALL MY LIFE I HAD BEEN TAUGHT YOU KNOW THAT THE ARABS DON'T EXIST HERE 
THAT THEY ARE NOT A PART OF MY LIFE 
AND THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO BE A PART OF MY LIFE 
AND THAT I DON'T HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT THEM 
LEARNING ABOUT THEIR LIVES CONVINCED SUSAN THAT ISRAELI ARABS ENJOY FEWER RIGHTS PARTICULARLY TO LAND 
WHICH FORCES THEM INTO GHETTOES AND THAT A JEWISH MAJORITY STATE INEVITABLY LEADS TO DISCRIMINATION 
THIS IS A POLICY A DELIBERATE POLICY OF SEPARATION 
FROM THE STATE OF EXCLUSION FROM MAINSTREAM ISRAELI JEWISH SOCIETY 
BECAUSE SUSAN IS THE TEACHER 
ISRAEL HAS BECOME AN ETHNOCRACY 
AND EVEN A THEOCRACY 
AND IT'S A VERY MISERABLE SITUATION 
AND SO THIS WAS THE AWAKENING FOR ME 
MY LIFE'S CHOICE IS TO LIVE HERE IN TAMRA TO SAY THAT WHAT GOES ON WITH THE OCCUPATION 
AND THE BRUTAL EXCLUSION OF ARABS FROM MAINSTREAM SOCIETY HERE 
UM DOES NOT REPRESENT ME AS A JEW 
THAT I AM NOT COMPLICIT IN UM 
LAND CONFISCATION THAT I AM NOT COMPLICIT IN THE OCCUPATION 
THAT I DO NOT FIND MY SECURITY IN THE BRUTAL OCCUPATION OF ANOTHER ETHNIC GROUP 
IT IS NOT WHAT MY RELIGION IS ABOUT TO ME 
THE BASIS OF JUDAISM IS ABOUT DO NOT DO UNTO OTHER PEOPLE 
THAT WHICH YOU WOULD NOT WANT DONE UNTO YOURSELF 
IT IS ABOUT TREATING OTHER PEOPLE YOUR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS 
WITH RESPECT WITH RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY FOR LIFE 
MY RELIGION IS JUDAISM BUT NOT THE SORT OF JUDAISM THAT THE STATE PERPETUATES 
SUSAN NATHAN'S EXPERIENCE AND HER VIEWS ARE UNUSUAL IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY 
WHERE CRITICISM OF ISRAEL IS RARE 
ISRAELI ARABS ARE FULLY FREE THE FIRST COUNTRY THAT GRANTED 
ARAB WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WAS ISRAEL 
ARAB CITIZENS OF ISRAEL HAVE FULL RIGHTS EQUAL TO JEWS IN ISRAELI LIFE 
IN THE LAW THEY ARE EQUAL CITIZENS THEY VOTE 
THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE NATIONAL LIFE 
HOWEVER LIKE MANY MINORITIES IN COUNTRIES INCLUDING BRITAIN AND WESTERN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA 
THEY FACE DISCRIMINATION MEANING UNEQUAL BUDGETS SOMETIMES FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES 
POOR EDUCATION STANDARDS POOR HEALTH STANDARDS ETC 
THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT ISRAEL FACES BUT THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT EVERY WESTERN COUNTRY FACES 
BUT SOME BRITISH JEWS ARGUE THAT RESTRICTED RIGHTS TO LAND AND CITIZENSHIP 
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ISRAELI ARABS 
AND THEREFORE THAT THE JEWS' AUTOMATIC RIGHT TO RETURN NEEDS A RETHINK 
PEOPLE GOING TODAY WHO AREN'T AWARE OF ALL OF THAT 
ARE ACTUALLY ONLY GOING TO CONTRIBUTE TO 
A WORSENING OF THE SITUATION INSIDE ISRAEL ITSELF 
BECAUSE 
WHILE THE CURRENT ARRANGEMENTS SURROUNDING ALIYAH EXIST 
AND WHILE THE IDEOLOGY AROUND IT IS STILL IN PLACE 
I FEEL THAT THAT'S NOT FUNDAMENTALLY GOOD 
FOR THE CONTINUATION OF ISRAELI SOCIETY AS A JEWISH SOCIETY 
BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN ISRAEL 
SADLY IS THERE HAS BEEN A GROWTH OF RACIST IDEAS 
THERE HAS BEEN A GREATER STRESS ON THE ETHNO RELIGIOUS CHARACTER OF ISRAEL THAN EVER BEFORE 
AND PEOPLE OF A RELIGIOUS BENT WHO ARE GOING THERE TODAY 
ARE ONLY GOING TO SORT OF FEED INTO THAT AND POSSIBLY STRENGTHEN THAT SIDE OF IT 
RIGHT FROM THE FOUNDING IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT 
WAS THAT ISRAEL WAS A HAVEN FOR THE WORLD'S JEWS AND THEY COULD COME 
AND THAT'S WHY THE LAW OF RETURN IS THERE 
I THINK THE PALESTINIANS HAVE A RIGHT OF RETURN 
THE RIGHT OF RETURN IS TO THE FUTURE PALESTINIAN STATE 
JUST LIKE ISRAEL HAS A LAW OF RETURN FOR JEWS TO COME AND BUILD ISRAEL AND THEY HAVE 
IF WE EVER GET TO A SITUATION WITH THE STATE OF PALESTINE 
I GUESS THE PALESTINIAN GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO HAVE A SIMILAR LAW OF RETURN 
AND THAT MEMBERS OF THE PALESTINIAN DIASPORA WHO LIVE ALL AROUND THE WORLD 
CAN COME AND BUILD THE FUTURE STATE OF PALESTINE 
I THINK THE ISSUE OF REFUGEES RETURNING TO ISRAEL IS A COMPLETE NON STARTER 
OH THE SNAKE PASS THE SNAKE PASS 
YONATAN COHEN IS LEARNING HEBREW IN PREPARATION TO EXERCISE HIS RIGHT OF RETURN AS A JEW TO ISRAEL 
HE KNOWS THAT TO SOME IT'S A CONTROVERSIAL MOVE 
LLANDUDNO 
LLANDUDNO LLANDUDNO 
WALES WALES 
JEWISH PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO GO AND LIVE IN ISRAEL 
I DON'T THINK THAT IS A PROBLEM BUT THEN I DO UNDERSTAND WHY 
CERTAIN PEOPLE MIGHT SEE THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY EVERY JEW'S RIGHT 
WHEN THERE ARE DIFFERENT PEOPLE LIVING IN A LAND 
WHO AREN'T NECESSARILY YOU KNOW 
WHO AREN'T JEWISH AND YOU KNOW WHO HAVE FAMILY THERE 
WHO DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO AND LIVE WHERE THEIR FAMILIES CAME FROM 
I CAN JUST GO AND LIVE IN THAT COUNTRY 
I CAN GET BENEFITS WHEN THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE LIVING THERE WHO DON'T NECESSARILY GET THE SAME BENEFITS 
OR WHO ARE LIVING DIFFERENT LIVES IN THE SAME LAND 
I WISH I COULD CHANGE THOSE ISSUES AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY 
A COMFORTING FEELING KNOWING THAT THERE ARE PROBLEMS YOU KNOW 
IT'S LIKE AN INNER STRUGGLE SOMETIMES 
CEREMONY CEREMONY WALL WALL 
ON THE NEFESH B'NEFESH WEBSITE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE 
SPENT TIME LOOKING THERE IS A WEALTH OF INFORMATION HERE 
NEFESH B'NEFESH WHO PROMOTE AND FACILITATE ALIYAH ARE HELPING YONATAN MAKE THE MOVE 
WE'VE BROUGHT SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE FROM THE U. K. 
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS FROM TWO THOUSAND SIX 
WE'VE BROUGHT ALTOGETHER FOURTEEN THOUSAND 
OUR GOAL IS BY TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THAT IS IN SEVEN YEARS FROM NOW TO BRING ALL TOGETHER 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OUT OF WHICH I BELIEVE ABOUT TEN THOUSAND FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM 
ALTHOUGH THE NUMBERS LEAVING AREN'T YET SO SIGNIFICANT 
SOME ARGUE THAT IT'S A TREND THAT IS ALREADY STARTING TO TAKE ITS TOLL 
ON THE MAKEUP OF THE BRITISH JEWISH COMMUNITY 
THE MAJOR GROUP ARE YOUNG COUPLES AND SINGLES 
WHO WOULD STAY HERE AND WOULD BECOME COMMUNITY LEADERS AND ACTIVISTS 
AND THEIR CHILDREN WOULD GO TO SCHOOL HERE 
AND THEY GO AND LIVE IN ISRAEL AND THAT REDUCES THE RELIGIOUS 
ZIONIST POPULATION OF BRITAIN AND THE MODERN ORTHODOX POPULATION 
AND IT HAS HAD AN EFFECT AND SOME PEOPLE SAY THERE IS SOMETHING OF A VACUUM NOW IN THE LEADERSHIP 
AND THE NUMBERS CERTAINLY IN THE PROVINCIAL JEWISH COMMUNITIES 
ONCE YOU GET OUTSIDE THE MAJOR CENTRES OF LONDON SOUTH HERTFORDSHIRE AND GREATER MANCHESTER 
ALL THE PROVINCIAL COMMUNITIES ARE RAPIDLY DECLINING 
ONE OFTEN FINDS THAT THE MOST DYNAMIC MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY 
GO TO PLACES LIKE ISRAEL BECAUSE THERE THEY CAN LIVE A FULL JEWISH EXPERIENCE 
THEY'RE EITHER RELIGIOUS OR NOT THEY WANT TO WORK ON A KIBBUTZ OR NOT 
SO I DO THINK OVER THE LONG TERM THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL AND ALIYAH 
HAVE DIMINISHED THE JEWISH COMMUNITY NOT ONLY NUMERICALLY 
BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF ITS DYNAMISM 
CAN YOU SAY HI CAN YOU SAY SHALOM 
EIGHT MONTHS AFTER THEIR MOVE THE KAYES ARE ENJOYING JEWISH FAMILY LIFE IN JERUSALEM 
SO FAR 
SO FAR SO GOOD 
WE'RE HAPPY WE'VE GOT WORK WE'VE MET NICE PEOPLE 
WE'VE BUILT A LOVELY HOME 
IT'S NICE ALTHOUGH I STILL MISS A LOT OF PEOPLE BACK THERE 
MARC WORKS WITH VISITING JEWISH STUDENTS 
MIRIAM STUDIES PART TIME AND IS SETTING UP AN INTERFAITH PROJECT 
PEOPLE SAID TO ME AND I KNEW THAT THERE WOULD BE DIFFICULTIES 
BUT EXPERIENCING THE DIFFICULTIES AND FEELING THE HATRED AND THE CONFLICT 
AND HOW IT FEEDS INTO THOSE EVERYDAY MEETINGS IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT 
BUT IT ALSO MAKES ME FEEL SO MUCH MORE 
SET ON SOMETHING THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE 
I'M WORKING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE THE NEXT GENERATION 
ESPECIALLY HAVING A CHILD YOU THINK WHAT WORLD WILL SHE GROW UP IN 
IS THERE GOING TO BE LESS OR MORE HATRED 
ARE PEOPLE GOING TO BE EDUCATED ABOUT ONE ANOTHER 
ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE SPENT TIME WITH ONE ANOTHER 
IT'S VERY HARD SOMETIMES I FEEL NAIVE ABOUT IT 
SOMETIMES A BIT TOO IDEALISTIC 
BUT I THINK SOMEONE HAS TO HAVE THOSE IDEALS HERE AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY I'M WORKING ON THAT 
THE MAIN PEOPLE THAT I SEE IN MY DAY TO DAY LIFE ARE JEWS THAT 
COME FROM ALL OF THESE DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS ETHIOPIAN RUSSIAN MIDDLE EASTERN PEOPLE 
IN TERMS OF ISRAELI ARABS OR PALESTINIANS OR DRUIZE NOT REALLY SO MUCH 
I MEAN FOR ME PERSONALLY BEYOND THE DA'UD WHO CLEANS OUR STAIRS 
I HAVE A BIT OF A TENSION POINT THERE BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND BUT YOU DO GO AND SPEAK TO HIM 
I DO YOU HAVE ASKED HIM HIS NAME 
I GO AND SPEAK TO HIM OUT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF I WANT TO 
I FEEL TORN NORMALLY WOULD I SPEAK TO THE PERSON THAT CLEANS THE STAIRS 
NOT NECESSARILY BUT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT HE IS ISRAELI ARAB MUSLIM DRUIZE 
WHATEVER HE IS I FEEL THAT I WANT TO ALSO MAKE A POINT OF SAYING 
THAT I'M NOT GOING TO IGNORE YOU I'M GOING TO SPEAK TO YOU SMILE AT YOU 
WE HAVE VERY OCCASIONAL INTERACTIONS WHICH ARE NICE 
FOR ME THAT'S PART OF BEING CIVIL PART OF BEING A DECENT HUMAN BEING 
AND DECENCY IS SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN RAISED UP IN COMING FROM BRITAIN 
DECENCY IS IN SOME WAYS ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO MAINTAIN AT LEAST FOR OURSELVES 
IN OUR INTERACTIONS WITH PEOPLE NO MATTER WHERE THEY'RE FROM 
BUT PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND INTERFAITH PROGRESS IS STILL A LONG WAY OFF 
THE SUICIDE ATTACKER WALKED IN 
PULLED A MACHINE GUN FROM A TOOLBOX AND OPENED FIRE 
LAST NIGHT A PALESTINIAN GUNMAN WENT INTO AN ISRAELI YASHIVA 
I COULD KNOW SOMEBODY BECAUSE IT'S FROM A MODERN ORTHODOX COMMUNITY WHICH IS LIKE MY OWN 
MY COUSIN STUDIED IN THAT YASHIVA UM IN THAT SEMINARY 
AND UM THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I'M NOT IN AN INTERFAITH MOOD 
AND I THINK THAT'S O. K. TO SAY IN THIS SORT OF ENVIRONMENT 
UM BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THE VALUES WILL DRIVE ME FORWARD 
DESPITE THE DANGERS OF LIVING IN ISRAEL THOSE ADVOCATING ALIYAH 
STILL APPEAL TO JEWS LOOKING FOR A PLACE OF SAFETY 
IN A WORLD WHICH IS A BIT UNCERTAIN WE ARE LIVING IN BETWEEN WORLD ORDERS 
NOW THINGS ARE MUCH MORE FLUID 
WITH GLOBAL TERRORISM THE RISING OF ANTI SEMITISM AND WITH THE RISE OF 
EXTREME ISLAM WHICH ATTACK ANYWHERE UNFORTUNATELY GLOBALISATION ALSO 
WAS ABUSED BY TERROR GROUPS 
WHETHER THEY ARE AL QAEDA OR HEZBOLLAH AND THEY CAN ATTACK IN LONDON 
OR MADRID OR NEW YORK OR IN JERUSALEM OR IN BALI INDONESIA 
SO THIS TIME OF UNCERTAINTY I THINK THE SAFEST PLACE IS TO BE BACK HOME 
WE ARE WELCOMING AND WAITING FOR THEM 
TIMES HAVE CHANGED THERE'S NO MASS ALIYAH ANY MORE 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF JEWS LIVING IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES THAT NEED RESCUING 
UM IT DOESN'T REALLY FIT IN WITH WHAT A MODERN STATE SHOULD BE TODAY 
AND ISRAEL IS A MODERN STATE 
THE PROMISE AND THE TOAST OF THE PASSOVER CEREMONY 
WHICH LOOKS FORWARD TO JEWS SPENDING NEXT YEAR IN JERUSALEM 
REMAINS A HOPE FOR MANY 
FOR OTHERS IT'S STILL A QUESTIONABLE DREAM 
SO MANY JEWS NOW FOR SO MANY YEARS WHEN WE DO KNOW 
THE TRUTH OF WHAT'S GOING ON HAVE SHUT THEIR EYES TO IT 
SO AGAIN I WOULD LIKE PEOPLE GOING TO THINK ABOUT 
THEIR RESPONSIBILITY ALREADY FOR THE WAY ISRAEL IS TODAY 
THIS IS BASED ON THE IDEA OF THE EXODUS FROM EGYPT 
BUT IT'S STILL RELEVANT TODAY 
IT'S FOR JEWS WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE AN UNDERDOG 
IT'S FOR JEWS WHO UNDERSTAND WHO IDENTIFY WITH THE DISMISSED 
PEOPLES OF THE WORLD IT'S JEWS WHO UNDERSTAND IDEAS OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
THAT SOME PEOPLES HAVE BEEN DOWNTRODDEN IT'S A LESSON OF JEWISH HISTORY 
I HAVE MADE TWO ALIYAHS 
ONE TO THE JEWISH WORLD AND ANOTHER ONE TO THE ARAB WORLD 
AND THE ONE TO THE ARAB WORLD HAS BEEN FAR MORE REWARDING 
BECAUSE AFTER ALL I KNOW ABOUT THE JEWISH WORLD I COME FROM THAT ONE 
BUT NOW I AM LIVING IN THE ARAB WORLD 
SO I VIEW MYSELF AS A CITIZEN OF THE MIDDLE EAST 
I AM MISTRESS OF ALL I SURVEY 
YOU THREW YOUR LIFE AWAY BECAUSE HE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND YOUR CLEVER WORDS AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE 
MY CLEVER WORDS WILL SOON BE THE ONLY THING PUTTING A ROOF OVER MY HEAD 
WHAT HAPPINESS I AM ALL ALONE 
OUT OF STEP AND AHEAD OF HER TIME 
THE ONLY WAY TO GET A MAN LIKE MR. DARCY IS TO MAKE HIM UP 
THE UNTOLD STORY OF A GREAT STORYTELLER
