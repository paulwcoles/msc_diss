I WANT LABOUR TO RETURN TO A SOCIAL 
AGENDA TO STOP PANDERING TO THE 
RICH AND POWERFUL TO START THAT BY 
MAINTAINING THE TEN PENCE TAX I I WANT TO SEE A MORE DYNAMIC LABOUR 
ONE THAT ACTS ON POLICIES NOT JUST 
TALKS ABOUT THEM 
HELLO WELCOME TO THE POLITICS SHOW 
THIS WEEK THE FALLOUT AFTER THE 
DISMAL LOCAL ELECTION RESULTS FOR 
LABOUR LISTENING AND LEARNING 
BUT WHICH DIRECTION DOES GORDON 
BROWN GO IN WE HEAR FROM THE DEPUTY 
LABOUR LEADER HARRIET HARMAN 
CAN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY TURN THE 
IMPRESSIVE COUNCIL GAINS INTO THE 
PARLIAMENTARY SEATS 
THE WORKING 
CLASS WILL ALWAYS VOTE LABOUR 
IN LONDON ALL CHANGE AT CITY HALL 
WE ARE TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE 
SEISMIC EVENTS HERE AND OF COURSE 
TO PREDICT THE FUTURE 
I'LL BE SPEAKING WITH THE LEADING 
CONSERVATIVE MICHAEL GOVE AFTER 
THE NEWS AT 
THE ENDS OF A DISASTROUS WEEK FOR 
THE GOVERNMENT IN THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS GORDON BROWN ADMITTED HE 
HAD MADE MISTAKES DURING THE 
PREMIERSHIP BUT INSISTED HE IS THE 
RIGHT PERSON TO LEAD THE COUNTRY 
LABOUR WILL NOT USE THE WORD 
RELAUNCH BUT THE COMING DAYS ARE 
CRITICAL IF GORDON BROWN IS TO 
REASSERT HIS AUTHORITY CABINET 
MINISTERS SAY HE SHOULD NOT BE 
SINGLED OUT FOR BLAME BUT TODAY HE 
ADMITTED HE FELT RESPONSIBLE 
I WOULD LIKE TO ADMIT THERE WAS A 
PROBLEM THAT WAS THERE PERHAPS I 
HAVE SPENT TOO LITTLE TIME THINK 
BEING HOW WE CAN GET OUR ARGUMENTS 
ACROSS TO THE PUBLIC NOW OF 
COURSE I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE 
SAYING CAN YOU SHOW US YOU CAN 
COME THROUGH THE DIFFICULT 
SITUATIONS I BELIEVE WE WILL 
THE PAPERS ARE FULL OF SPECULATION 
ABOUT POSSIBLE LEADERSHIP CONTEST 
ALTHOUGH SEVENTY LABOUR M. P.'S WOULD HAVE 
TO BACK THE IDEA DOES MR. BROWN 
EXPECT A CHALLENGE 
I DON'T THINK 
THAT MANY M. P.'S ARE SAYING THAT THE 
KEY ISSUE IS HOW TO COME THROUGH 
THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CHALLENGES 
THAT FACE THE COUNTRY I BELIEVE I 
AM THE BEST PERSON TO TAKE THE 
COUNTRY WITH ALISTAIR DARLING 
THROUGH THE CHALLENGES 
HE SAID HE WOULD GO AROUND THE 
COUNTRY MORE OFTEN TO CONNECT WITH 
THE VOTERS BUT DID HE ACCEPT THERE 
WAS A PROBLEM WITH HIS PERSONALITY 
PEOPLE SAY YOU ARE STRANGE NOT 
LIKE THEM YOU ARE A WORKAHOLIC 
OLD STYLE POLITICIAN WHO DOES NOT 
EMPATHISE WITH WITH THE WAY THAT 
PEOPLE EXPECT 
I COME FROM AN 
ORDINARY BACKGROUND L. THINK THAT 
THE PEOPLE I GREW UP WITH ARE STILL 
FRIENDS OF MINE THEY ARE THE 
PEOPLE I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH L. 
THINK THAT REPRESENTS THE PEOPLE OF 
THE COUNTRY WHEN WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT THINGS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
SPORTS EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON 
IN OUR COUNTRY L. L. THINK YOU KNOW 
THE REAL ME IS SOMEONE WHO 
UNDERSTANDS AT ROOT ALL OF THE 
CHALLENGES THAT THE ORDINARY 
FAMILYS FAMILIES FACE AFTER AFTER BORIS JOHNSON'S VICTORY AS THE LORD 
MAYOR THE CONSERVATIVES ARE ON A 
HIGH DETERMINED TO KEEP THE 
PRESSURE ON THE PRIME MINISTER 
THE GOVERNMENT 
PARKED IN A BEAUTY SPOT 
WITHIN THE LAST FEW MINUTES THE 
POLICE HAVE REOPENED THE ROAD THAT 
LEADS UP INTO THE HILLS WHERE THE 
BODIES OF THE TWO LITTLE BOYS WERE 
FOUND THE POLICE HAVE BEEN BUSY 
ALL MORNING THE DOG TEAM HAS BEEN 
THERE WE KNOW THAT THEY REMOVED 
THE CAR THAT IS THOUGHT TO HAVE 
BELONGED TO THE BOYCE FATHER 
IT IS CLEAR THAT THE POLICE HAVE 
GOOD IDEA AS TO WHAT HAPPENED WHEN 
THE ALARM WAS RAISED WHO AMBULANCES 
WERE CALLED PICKED UP A MAN 
STILL ALIVE FROM THE SCENE HE WAS 
TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL IN GLASGOW 
THE POLICE ARE SAYING THEY ARE 
FOLLOWING A POSITIVE LINE OF 
INQUIRY WE ARE HEARING THAT CARBON 
DIOXIDE COMS POISONING CARBON 
MONOXIDE POISONING COULD HAVE LED 
TO THE DEATH OF THE BOYS 
AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED FORTY THREE PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN A 
POWERFUL CYCLONE IN BURMA 
IT HAS CAUTIONED CAUSED 
WIDESPREAD FLOODING AND DESTRUCTION 
MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND HOMES ARE DAMAGED 
AND ELECTRICITY SUPPLIES ARE CUT 
OFF OFF THAT IS THE NEWS FOR THE MOMENT 
THE NEXT NEWS BULLETIN IS AT 
SIX TEN ZERO ZERO P. M. SIX TEN ZERO ZERO P. M. NOW HYPERBOLE AND OVERHEATED 
RHETORIC ARE THE STANDARD FARE OF 
POLITICAL DISCOURSE BUT THIS 
WEEKEND THE NEWSPAPERS WERE RIGHT 
TO SCOUR EVERY VARIATION OF THE 
WORD AWFUL IT IS JUSTIFIED 
LABOUR TOOK A POUNDING 
WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE EXPERTS AND 
PUNDITS BUT WHAT ABOUT THE 
ORDINARY LABOUR SUPPORTERS WHO 
DESERTED A PARTY WHAT MESSAGE CAN 
THEY SEND CAN THEY BE BROUGHT BACK 
INTOLED FOLD L. AM HAVING A DRINK 
WITH TWO VERY DIFFERENT LABOUR 
VOTERS THEY BOTH LOST THEIR FAITH 
IN THE PARTY THIS WEEK CHARLES 
YOU ARE A MANAGER IN THE PUBLIC 
SECTOR IN SURREY YOU VOTED LABOUR 
ALL OF YOUR LIFE YET THIS WEEK 
COULD NOT BRING YOURSELF TO VOTE 
FOR THEM WHY WHAT HAPPENED I I THINK THAT LABOUR HAS LOST ITS WAY 
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW THEY ARE NO 
LONGER A LABOUR PARTY THEY ARE A 
PARTY NOW WHO ARE COW TOWING TO BIG 
BUSINESS TO AMERICAN BUSINESS AND 
MONEY SEEMS TO BE THE BYWORD OF 
EVERYTHING AS A LABOUR SUPPORTERS 
I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THERE NEEDS 
TO BE A BALANCE BETWEEN THE MONEY 
SIDE OF THINGS AND THE SOCIAL SIDE 
OF THINGS WITH CARING FOR PEOPLE 
AND PEOPLE COMING BEFORE MONEY L. 
THINK THAT LABOUR HAS LOST THAT 
NOW MARK YOU LIVE IN LONDON YOU 
WORK IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES 
BECAUSE YOU ARE LITTLE BIT 
YOUNGER THAN CHARLES NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WAS THE 
FIRST TIME YOU GT TO VOTE IN 
GENERAL ELECTION YOU VOTED FOR 
TONY BLAIR THIS WEEK YOU SWITCHED 
TO THE CONSERVATIVES WHY 
I FELT 
LABOUR LOST ITS WAY IT WAS NOT THE 
SAME PARTY THAT I VOTED FOR IN NINETY SEVEN 
THERE THEY HAD A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS 
THEY FELT WE ALL FELT WE WERE 
READY FOR A CHANGE I THINK THEY 
DELIVERED ON IT BUT NOW IT IS 
VERY DIFFERENT L. SAT DOWN AND I 
READ THE MANIFESTOS FOR THE MAYOR 
WHAT THEY WERE SAYING BOTHER OUT 
WHAT I FELT ON A NATIONAL PICTURE 
BORIS JOHNSON SEEMED TO HAVE THE 
IDEAS HE WAS WILLING TO TALK ABOUT 
POLICIES MORE WHEREAS KEN 
LIVINGSTONE SEEMED TO BE ALMOST 
RESTING ON HIS LAURELS TALKING 
ABOUT PAST ACHIEVELETS 
ACHIEVEMENTS NOT REALLY TALKING 
ABOUT WHERE HE WANTED TO GO L. WENT 
WITH THE PEOPLE WITH NEW IDEAS 
LABOUR ARE SAYING THEY ARE 
LISTENING CAN EACH OF YOU TELL ME 
WHAT THEY CAN DO TO GET YOU BACK I I THINK THEY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING 
MORE THAN LISTEN LISTEN IS HOLLOW 
WORDS THEY HAVE TO TAKE POSITIVE 
ACTION AND TAKE POSITIVE ACTION NOW 
NOT IN NINE MONTHS IN THE FUTURE 
BUT NOW ONE OF THE THINGS THEY CAN 
START OFF BY DOING IS TO REVERSE 
THE POLICY ON THE TEN PENCE TAX 
THAT PROBABLY BENEFITS ME BY 
GETTING RID OF THAT L. AM FORTUNATE 
ENOUGH TO BE IN THAT POSITION L. 
HAVE A SOCIAL CONSCIOUS LIKE I 
THINK MOST PEOPLE DO IN THIS 
COUNTRY I THOUGHT THAT THE LABOUR 
PARTY DID 
MARK HOW CAN LABOUR GET YOU BACK 
I GUESS I WOULD NEED TO SEE 
RETURN TO THE DYNAMISM THAT WE HAD 
WHEN NEW LABOUR CAM IN WHEN I 
VOTED IN NINETY SEVEN THE PARTY WERE FULL 
OF IDEAS THE COUNTRY WAS READY FOR 
A CHANGE THEN THEY ACTED AND ACTED 
WELL BUT IT DOES NOT FEEL LIKE TO 
ME AS IF LABOUR HAVE THE IDEAS 
ANYMORE THE IDEAS THAT THEY DO 
SEEM TO HAVE COME UP WITH RECENTLY 
SEEM TO HAVE BEEN BY AND LARGE 
ONES THEY HAVE STOLEN FROM THE 
CONSERVATIVES CONSERVATIVES NOW I'M NOT I HAVE NOT BEEN 
ENTRENCHED IN ONE PARTY OR THE 
OTHER WHERE I COME FROM IS VERY 
MUCH I WILL GO WITH THE PEOPLE 
WITH THE IDEAS AT THE MOMENT IT 
DOES NOT FEEL LIKE LABOUR ARE THAT 
PARTY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH PARTY THERE YOU HAVE IT TWO VERY 
DIFFERENT TYPES OF LABOUR VOTERS 
THEY DO SHARE SOME CONCERNS BUT 
THEY ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT VERY 
DIFFERENT THINGS IF COME THE IN 
CONNECTION GENERAL ELECTION ALL 
LABOUR EX EFRPL IFIED BY CHARLES 
STAYS AND DOES NOT VOTE FOR ANYBODY 
AND MARK GOES TO VOTE FOR THE 
CONSERVATIVES THE GOVERNMENT IS IN 
TROUBLE TROUBLE AN ELECTION COULD BE IS LIKELY TO 
BE TWO YEARS AWAY WITHOUT 
REVERTING TO HAROLD WILSON'S QUOTE 
THAT IS A LONG TIME IN ATLANTICS 
SO HOW BAD ARE THINGS FOR GORDON 
BROWN AND LABOUR WE HAVE BEEN 
TESTING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE 
PARTY FATHFUL SHE IS WITH US NOW 
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND 
WE HAVE S. P. O. 
SPOKEN TO DOZENS OF M. P.'S SOME FIERY 
LANGUAGE ONE FORMER CABINET 
MINISTER SAID THAT GORDON BROWN 
SHOULD GO THAT WE CANNOT BE 
SENTIMENTAL LIKE WE WERE WITH 
MICHAEL FOOT WE HAD TO BE RUTHLESS 
LIKE THE CONSERVATIVES OTHERWISE 
A RUDE WORD TO FOLLOW THAT I WILL 
NOT SAY ON TELEVISION 
ANY OTHER COMPLIMENTARY WORDS FOR 
GORDON BROWN 
ALL OF THEM WERE OFF 
THE RECORD MELL AN KOLYIBLG ONE 
MAN HAPPY TO BE NAMED WAS GRAHAM 
STRINGER HE SAYS THAT THE PARTY 
NEEDS A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION 
ABOUT THE LEADERSHIP OTHERWISE 
WHEN THERE IS A GENERAL ELECTION 
DEFEAT AT THE WILL BE LEFT 
WONDERING WHY DID THEY NOT SORT IT 
OUT IN TWHAIGT 
GORDON BROWN WAS BRILLIANT IN 
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT GORDON BROWN WAS A BRILLIANT 
CHANCELLOR BUT I DON'T THINK HE IS 
CUTTING THE MUSTARD AS THE PRIME 
MINISTER AT THIS POINT IN TIME HE 
MUST GET BACK TOT VALUES HE HAD AS 
THE CHANCELLOR 
THAT MAN IS DAVE STEVENS HE LED 
BLYTHE DISTRICT COUNCIL WHICH 
LABOUR LOST ON THURSDAY 
OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING 
PETER KILFOYLE A FORMER GOVERNMENT 
MINISTER WAS HAPPY TO GO ON CAMERA 
SAYING HE WAS NOT CALLING FOR A 
LEADERSHIP CHANGE BUT A CHANGE IN 
DIRECTION 
I DON'T THINK THAT DIRECTION SWAPPING THE CAPTAIN ON THE TITANIC 
IS NECESSARILY THE WAY IN WHICH YOU 
SAVE THE SHIP ODDLY ENOUGH I WAS 
LISTENING TO TESSA JOWELL SHE WAS 
GOING ON ABOUT NEW LABOUR HOW IT 
MUST CARRY ON IN THE SAME WAY I 
THINK THIS IS NONSENSE IF THAT IS 
JUST A RECIPE FOR MORE OF THE SAME 
I THINK THAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS 
TO REFOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON THOSE 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE DESERTED US PEOPLE 
WHO FEEL AS THOUGH WE HAVE LEFT 
THEM OUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE 
ISSUES WHICH HAVE UNDERPINNED THAT 
REJECTION REJECTION SO A TRICKY FEW WEEKS WHAT SHOULD 
WE LOOK OUT FOR 
ALL OF THE 
CONSTITUENTS ARE TO GET NEW POLICY 
PROGRAMMES THIS WEEK THAT WILL 
GIVE THEM A CLEARER IDEA ABOUT 
WHERE THE PARTY IS GOING THE M. P.'S 
ARE SAYING WE NEED A CLEAR MESSAGE 
TO SELL TO VOTERS ANOTHER FORMER 
MINISTER HAPPY TO GO ON CAMERA IS 
STEPHEN LADYMAN HE SAID WE HAVE TO 
GET CLEAR MESSAGES IN LANGUAGES 
THAT THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND OUT TO 
THE VOTERS 
IT HAS BEEN A BAD WEEK WE HAVE TO 
SHOW WE ARE ON THEIR SIDE WE HAVE 
TO EXPLAIN WHAT WE ARE DOING IN 
DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES IN SIMPLER 
LANGUAGE THAN WE ARE USED TO WE 
HAVE TO SAY TO GORDON NOT TO BE 
ANYTHING ELSE BUT GORDON IT DOES 
NOT WORK HE IS A SERIOUS MAN A 
BRILLIANT MAN DON'T TRY TO 
REINVENT YOURSELF GET ON WITH YOUR 
JOB JOB THEY ARE IN DIFFICULTY WITH THAT 
MESSAGE ALREADY THERE WAS A 
MEETING WITH THE M. P.'S ON THURSDAY 
NIGHT I WAS TOLD THAT TWO CABINET 
MEMBERS COULD NOT AGREE BETWEEN 
THEMSELVES WHAT THE SIMPLE MESSAGE 
SHOULD BE IN THE FUTURE GORDON 
BROWN MIGHT FACE DEFEAT FROM HIS 
OWN M. P.'S OVER THE DECISION TO DETAIN 
TERROR SUSPECTS FOR FORTY TWO DAYS ONE 
BACKBENCHER WHO IS AGAINST THIS 
DETENTION SAYS WHY ON EARTH IS 
GORDON BROWN DOING THIS IT WILL BE 
A SELF INFLICTED WOUND THOSE ARE 
SOME OF THE COMMENTS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
JOINING ME HERE IS THE DEPUTY 
LABOUR LEADER HARRIET HARMAN SO 
THE THE MESSAGE SEEMS TO BE YOU 
ARE GOING TO GO OUT LISTEN AND 
REFLECT IS THAT RIGHT 
WE HAVE TO 
REFLECT WHAT PEOPLE WERE SAYING IN 
THE ELECTION ON THURSDAY RECOGNISE 
THAT PEOPLE ARE FEELING THE PINCH 
WE NEED A SHARPER FOCUS ON FAMILY 
FINANCES BUT AT THE SAME TIME 
WHEN DID YOU STOP LISTENING THE THE QUESTION OF THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE 
AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE'S FUEL BILLS 
AND FOOD BILLS WERE GOING UP WE 
WERE SLOW TO BRING IN THE PACKAGE 
TO COMPENSATE PEOPLE WHO WOULD LOSE 
OUT FROM THE CHANGE IN THE TEN 
PENCE TAX WE RECOGNISE THAT IT IS 
RIGHT WE HAVE BEEN BIG ENOUGH TO 
SAY WE GO THAT ONE WRONG 
IT WAS ONLY WHEN YOU WERE FACING 
ABSOLUTE CERTAIN DEFEAT YOU WERE 
BIG ENOUGH UNTIL THEN YOU SAID 
THIS WAS NO PROBLEM 
WITH THE LAST 
BUDGET WE DID A GREAT DEAL TO 
IMPROVE THE INCOME OF LOWER INCOME 
FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN AND WITH 
PENSIONERS BUT THERE WERE TWO 
PARTICULAR GROUPS THAT WE DID NOT 
ACT EARLY ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH THEIR 
SITUATION AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF 
PEOPLE HAVING GENUINE CONCERNS 
ABOUT INCREASING PRICES SO I DO 
THINK WE NEED A SHARPER FOCUS ON 
THE FAMILY FINANCES WE WILL ALSO 
WE MUST RECOGNISE I DO THINK THAT 
PEOPLE SHOULD BE REASSURESED 
REASSURED WE ARE CONFIDENT ABOUT 
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE ECONOMY 
THE REALLY FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE ABOUT 
KEEPING STEADY ECONOMIC GROWTH BUT 
ENSURING THERE ARE JOBS IN THE 
ECONOMY AND LOW UNEMPLOYMENT WE 
KNOW PEOPLE ARE FEELING THE PINCH 
IN THE FAMILY FINANCES WE KNOW 
THERE IS AN ECONOMIC STORM 
INTERNATIONALLY BUT WE ARE 
CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE IN THE BEST 
POSSIBLE POSITION TO WEATHER THE 
STORM WE HAVE TO LISTEN AND TO 
REFLECT ON PEOPLE'S CONCERN THEY 
ARE FEELING THE PINCH BUT REASSURE 
PEOPLE THAT THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE 
ECONOMY ARE AS SOUND AS THEY COULD 
BE BE YOU SAY YOU HAVE TO LISTEN AND 
REFLECT YOU SAY YOU THINK YOU 
ALREADY KNOW WHAT THE PEOPLE THINK 
L. SAID WE DID NOT ACT QUICKLY 
ENOUGH IN RELATION TO THE TEN PENCE 
TAX WE HAVE TO RECOGNISE HOW IT 
HAPPENED AND MAKE SURE IT DOES NOT 
HAPPEN AGAIN ALSO TO REASSURE 
PEOPLE THAT THE ECONOMIC 
FUNDAMENTALS ARE SOUND 
ARE 
PEOPLE TAXED TOO HIGHLY WHEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE FEELING THE PINCH THAT 
IS WHY THE QUESTION OF THE TEN P. WAS 
A PROBLEM WE HAVE TO DO AS MUCH AS 
WE CAN TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE 
STRUGGLING LOW INCOME FAMILIES 
CERTAINLY YES 
ARE PEOPLE TAXED 
TOO MUCH 
THE BURDEN OF TAXATION IS 
NOT AS HIGH AS IT WAS AT ONE POINT 
UNDER THE PREVIOUS LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT WE HAVE TO RAISE ENOUGH 
TAXES TO ENSURE 
ELEVEN YEARS 
AGO 
YES 
WE HAVE GT TO MAKE SURE AGO WE RAISE ENOUGH TAXES AND WE 
CONTINUE TO INVEST IN EDUCATION 
AND IN THE HEALTH SERVICES AND SO 
IT IS ALWAYS A DIFFICULT BALANCE 
YOU HAVE SAID YOU GOING TO LISTEN 
I'M SURE IF YOU STOP PEOPLE HERE IN 
TELEVISION CENTRE THEY WILL SAY I 
FEEL I'M TAXED TOO HIGHLY 
WELL I 
THINK TAX IS NEVER POPULAR WITH 
ANYBODY BUT PEOPLE ALSO WANT TO 
SEE GOOD EDUCATION 
YOU ARE 
SAYING WE HAVE MADE A DECISION THAT 
ACTUALLY PEOPLE MAY SAY WE ARE 
TAXED TOO HIGHLY BUT WE BELIEVE AS 
A GOVERNMENT WHICH IS A LEGITIMATE 
THING TO SAY THAT EDUCATION AND 
HEALTH SPENDING IS MORE IMPORTANT 
THERE IS RANGE OF VIEWS PEOPLE 
WANT MORE INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION 
BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT IS NOT ONLY 
IMPORTANT FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR LIVES BUT 
THEY KNOW IT IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR 
ECONOMY THAT WE HAVE SKILLED AND 
EDUCATED WORKFORCE SO OF COURSE 
PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE LOWER TAXES 
BUT THEY WANT TO HAVE CONTINUED 
INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC SERVICES AND 
THAT IS WE HAVE TRIED TO DO THAT 
IS WHY REPRODUCED THE REDUCED THE 
TWENTY TWO PENCE RATE 
IF YOU HAVING TO GO 
TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE TO FIND O' ULT 
WHAT THEIR VIEWS ARE DOESN'T THAT 
SUGGEST THAT YOU HAVE LOST TOUCH 
WITH THE BRITISH PEOPLE AND MAYBE 
AFTER TEN YEARS OF BEING DRIVEN 
AROUND IN MINISTERIAL CARS 
ORDINARY PEOPLE THINK YOU LIVE ON A 
DIFFERENT PLANET THAT IS WHAT WE 
SAW IN THE VOTES ON THURSDAY WELL WELL PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR 
FAMILY FINANCES THEY MADE THAT 
FELT DURING THE ELECTION THAT IS 
THE CASE BUT WE ARE CONCERNED L. 
DO MYSELF GO OUT AND ABOUT AND 
LISTEN TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING 
WE DID HEAR IT ON THE ELECTION 
CAMPAIGN THAT WE HAVE BEEN SLOW TO 
ACT ON THE TEN P. WITH PEOPLE BEING 
CONCERNED ABOUT PRICES WE HAVE TO 
HAVE MORE OF A FOCUS ON FAMILY 
FINANCES AS WELL AS ON THE OVERALL 
ECONOMIC STRATEGY OF THE KEEPING 
THE ECONOMY STABLE 
WE HAVE HAD 
GEOFF HOON SAYING THERE IS NO 
QUESTION IT SOUNDS LIKE NOTHING 
WILL CHANGE IF YOU COMING HERE TO 
TELL US THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE 
CHANGE WHAT IS THAT CHANGE 
ONE OF 
THE THINGS THAT WILL CHANGE IS 
THERE WILL BE A MUCH SHARPER 
FOCUSEN WHAT THE ALTERNATIVE AGENDA 
IS SUCH AS IT IS FROM 
CONSERVATIVES THEY WILL COME UNDER 
MORE SCRUTINY THEY HAVE BEEN IN A 
POSITION TO OFFER EVERYTHING TO ALL 
PEOPLE 
WE WILL SPEAK TO MICHAEL PEOPLE GOVE ABOUT THIS LET'S STICK TO 
LABOUR DOES THANT TRIVIALISE THE 
ZAIL OF WHAT YOUR UP AGAINST NO NO BECAUSE FUNDAMENTALLY POLITICS IS 
ABOUT A CHOICE THE CHOICES THAT 
PEOPLE HAVE MADE ON THURSDAY IS TO 
SAY LOOK WE ARE FEELING THE PINCH 
WE ARE FEELING OUR FAMILY FINANCES 
WE ARE FEELING WORRIED ABOUT WHAT 
WILL HAPPEN AND WE ARE GOING TO 
RESPOND AND WHETHER IT IS ON PEOPLE 
WORRIED ABOUT THE VALUE OF THEIR 
HOUSE OR THE FAMILY SHOPPING BUDGET 
OR WORRIED ABOUT THE COST OF 
FILLING UP THE CAR WE ARE GOING TO 
BRING THAT TOGETHER AND MAKE SURE 
WE HAVE A REAL FOCUS ON FAMILY 
FINANCES AS WELL AS THE MACRO 
ISSUES 
WHAT IF AFTER THIS ISSUES LISTENING T. PEOPLE TURN AROUND AND 
SAY THE PROBLEM IS GORDON BROWN I I DON'T THINK THAT IS THE CASE WHAT 
PEOPLE WANT IS TO BE ABLE TO BE 
BETTER OFF IN THEIR LIVES TO HAVE 
A STRONG ECONOMY AND GOOD PUBLIC 
SERVICES AND TO HAVE A SENSE OF 
SECURITY 
YOU HAVE MADE YOUR MIND SECURITY UP ON THAT ONE AS WELL 
I THINK 
THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE WANT IT IS FOR 
US TO MAKE SURE THAT IS WHAT THEY 
GET AND THAT WILL BE DELIVERED AND 
THAT WILL BE THE SITUATION 
ARE YOU 
SAYING AFTER ELEVEN MONTHS OF 
GORDON BROWN BEING PREMIER THERE IS 
NO ISSUE THERE AT ALL ABOUT HIS 
LEADERSHIP HEN HEY GONE FROM A 
POSITION OF PLUS FORTY SEVEN APPROVAL DOWN 
TO MINUS THIRTY SEVEN 
THE WRONG THING TO DO 
WOULD BE TO IN THE QUESTION 
OF THE LEADERSHIP BECAUSE PEOPLE 
DON'T WANT US LOOKING INWARDSS AND 
NAVAL GAZING THEY WANT US TO LOOK 
AT THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND SECONDLY 
BECAUSE WHEN THERE IS DIFFICULT 
ECONOMIC INTERNATIONAL TURBULENCE 
THE BEST PLACED PERSON TO LEAD 
THE COUNTRY IS THE PERSON WHO HAD A 
REMARKABLE RECORD FOR TEN YEARS AS 
THE CHANCELLOR AND THAT IS GORDON 
BROWN I'M DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY 
POINT IN ENGAGING IN SPECULATION 
THAT IS NOT WHAT OUR FOCUS WILL BE 
BUT YOU HAVE MINISTERS SAYING WE 
CAN'T BE LIKE WE WERE IN THE EIGHTIES 
THERE IS NO ROOM FOR SENMENTALITY 
UNLESS WE ARE DO SOMETHING 
WHO WAS 
THAT 
A FORMER CABINET MINISTER DO THAT DO THEY HAVE A NAME 
YES BUT THEY 
SPOKE TO US OFF THE RECORD AS YOU 
OFTEN DO 
I DON'T DO THAT L. DON'T 
KNOW WHO IT WAS OR WHY THEY SAID IT 
BUT I DON'T THINK THE ANALOGY WITH 
PREVIOUS LEADERS AND MICHAEL FOOT 
IS THE CASE GORDON BROWN HAS A 
GREAT DEAL OF COMMITMENT HE HAS A 
STRONG RECORD HE IS THE RIGHT 
PERSON TO LEAD US 
ARE YOU HUMBLED 
WE ARE DISAPPOINTED VERY 
DISAPPOINTED BIT PUTS 
RESPONSIBILITY ON US TO RECOGNISE 
WHAT PEOPLE WERE SAYING FIVE ACT ON I 
HUMBLED 
DETERMINED MORE HUMBLED DETERMINED 
THANK YOU AFTER THE DETERMINED LOCAL ELECTIONS A NEW CHALLENGE IS 
AROUND T. R. CORNER SURE THINK 
CONSERVATIVES WILL WIN THE BY 
ELECTION IN CREWE AND NANTWICH 
AFTER THE DEATH OF GWYNETH 
DUNWOODY BUT IT IS A LABOUR SEAT 
AND WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THE 
CONSERVATIVES HAD A BY ELECTION 
GAIN OVER A QUARTER OF A CENTURY 
AGO SO THE PRESSURE WILL BE ON 
DAVID CAMERON TO TAKE THE SEAT AND 
DEMONSTRATE THAT HIS NEW PARTY CAN 
WIN IN LABOUR'S HEARTLAND WE HAVE 
BEEN ASSESSING THE CHALLENGE RIGHT 
NOW I WOULD LIKE TO MEET THE 
PERSON WHO DOESN'T THINK I EARN MY 
SALARY ON THIS SHOW BUT A MOUNTAIN 
IS A GOOD ANALOGY FOR THE 
CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACING THE 
CONSERVATIVES AT THE MOMENTS IF 
YOU LOOK AT THE OPINION POLLS YOU 
LOOK AT THE ELECTION RESULTS YOU 
COULD BE FORGIVING FOR THINKING 
THAT DAVID CAMERON IS A RACING 
CERTAINTY TO WIN THE NEXT GENERAL 
ELECTION THE REALITY IS VERY 
DIFFERENT 
TO WIN A GENERAL ELECTION THE 
CONSERVATIVES NEED TO MAKE HISTORY 
CAST YOUR MIND BACK TO ICONIC 
ELECTION VICTORIES OF THE PAST IN 
NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR WILSON ENDED THIRTEEN YEARS OF 
CONSERVATIVE RULE BY GAINING A THIRTY ONE PER CENT 
CONSERVATIVE RULE BY GAINING A THIRTY ONE PER CENT SWING MRS. THATCHER UPCELT THE 
APPLE CART IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WHEN SHE 
STORMED INTO DOWNING STREET WITH A 
MASSIVE FIFTY THREE PER CENT SWING THAT RESULT HAS 
ONLY BEEN BETTERED ONCE IN ONE NINE ONE NINE SEVEN 
TONY BLAIR BROKE ALL THE RECORDS 
AND CLAIMED TO THE TOP OF THE 
MOUNTAIN AND INTO POWER WITH A 
TEN POINT TWO PER CENT SWING LOOK WHERE I AM SIXTY NINE PER CENT 
THAT IS THE SWING THAT DAVID 
CAMERON WOULD NEED O' AGAINST 
LABOUR TO GET JUST A ONE SEAT 
MAJORITY SIXTY NINE PER CENT ONE SEAT IT IS A 
HUGE ASK 
THE LAST TIME THE 
CONSERVATIVES WON A GENERAL 
ELECTION WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO THEY GOOD FOURTEEN 
MILLION VOTES AT THE LAST ELECTION 
THEY GOT NINE MILLION WHERE ARE THOSE 
MISSING FIVE MILLION CONSERVATIVE 
VOTES YES THE TORIES ARE POLLING 
WELL AT THE MOMENT BUT MANY 
GOVERNMENTS LIKE THIS LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN IN THE DUMPS 
MIDTERM X. AND GONE ON THE TO 
RECOVER IT HAPPENED TO TONY BLAIR 
AND JOHN MAJOR AND IT HAPPENED TO 
MRS. THATCHER IN THIS BATTLE 
BETWEEN CONSERVATIVES AND POLITICAL 
REALISM IS THE NEXT BIG TEST IT 
IS A BY ELECTION IN THREE WEEKS 
TIME AND IT IS JUST THE OTHER SIDE 
OF THEM THERE HILLS WELCOME TO 
CREWE A FAMOUS RAILWAY JUNCTION 
AND ONE OF THE FEW GENUINELY 
WORKING CLASS TOWNS LEFT IN 
CHESHIRE IF THIS WAS A MARGINAL 
CONSTITUENCY THE CONSERVATIVES 
WOULD BE EXPECTED TO WIN THE BY 
ELECTION IF THIS WAS A SAFE LABOUR 
SEAT THE CONSERVATIVES WOULD BE 
ALLOWED TO LOSE AS IT IS IF THE 
WHEELS ARE GOING TO STAY ON THE 
CONSERVATIVE BAND WAGON DAVID 
CAMERON NEEDS TO WIN THIS SEAT 
WHICH HAS BEEN LABOUR FOR MORE THAN 
SIXTY YEARS IT IS HARD TO COVER BY 
ELECTIONS WITHOUT PIES DON'T IS ME 
WHY IT IS A TRADITION THIS IS 
WRIGHT'S PIES IN CREWE THEY EMPLOY 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY PEOPLE AND HAVE BEEN A FAMILY 
RUN BUSINESS SINCE NINETEEN TWENTY SIX THESE 
PASTIES THANKS TO AN MOD CONTRACT 
COULD BE ON THEIR WAY TO 
AFGHANISTAN I'M TOLD THAT POLITICS 
FOR MUCH OF THE WORKFORCE IS TRIBAL 
THAT IS BACKED UP BY MANY OF THE 
WRIGHT'S WORKERS THAT I SPOKE TO 
THE WORKING CLASS WILL ALWAYS VOTE 
LABOUR IN CREWE 
CAN YOU IMAGINE 
VOTING CONSERVATIVE 
PERSONALLY NO 
WHY 
BECAUSE I CONSIDER MYSELF WHY WORKING CLASS 
THE GOVERNMENT HAVE 
MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES SOME OF THE 
POLICIES THEY HAVE DOIN U. TURNS 
BUT I STILL FEEL THAT A BULK OF IT 
IS A HANGOVER FROM THE PREVIOUS 
GOVERNMENT AND THEY ARE STILL 
TRYING TO GET IT RIGHT L. STILL 
FEEL I WOULD VOTE FOR THEM CUER CUER ALEXANDRA F. C. THESE ARE THE FUTURE 
STARS WHO WILL SWEEP THEM TO THE 
PREMIERSHIP IN THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTIES DAWN IS A 
CONSERVATIVE SHE BRINGS HER SON 
RHYS JAMES HERE AFTER SCHOOL 
LABOUR'S MAJORITY IN CREWE AND 
NANTWICH WAS SEVEN THOUSAND NOT AN 
IMPOSSIBLE TASK FOR THE TORIES BUT 
DAWN IS NOT SURE THEY HAVE GOT 
THEIR TACTICS RIGHT WHAT DO YOU 
THINK CONSERVATIVES COULD DO THAT 
IS 
MORE DISTINCTIVE CONCENTRATES CONCENTRATES MORE ON 
THE 
TAX ISSUES COME OFF THE GREEN AND CONCENTRATE ON THE TAX ISSUES GROCERY PRICES PETROL PRICES 
DAWN IS NOT CONFIDENT THAT PRICES DAVID CAMERON CAN SCORE WITH LABOUR 
FANS 
I HAVE FRIENDS THAT ARE FANS LABOUR THEY NOT GOING TO GO THE 
ONE STEP TO THE CONSERVATIVES THEY 
WILL GO TO SOMETHING UKIP 
INDEPENDENT 
THEY CAN'T BRING INDEPENDENT THEMSELVESS TO VOTE CONSERVATIVES 
THAT'S RIGHT 
THE TRIBAL THING YES YES POLITICAL AND CYSTS AND CYSTS 
AGREE THAT MAKING THE TORIES 
ATTRACTIVE TO SWING VOTER IS THE 
REAL CHANG CHALLENGE 
THEY ARE NOT 
GAINING VOTES FROM LABOUR HOOR 
LABOUR HAS LOST EIGHT THOUSAND VOTES SINCE 
NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN BUT THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE 
ONLY GAINED FIVE HUNDRED VOTES SO IT IS 
CLEAR GOING FROM THE LABOUR PARTY 
DOES NOT MEAN TRANSFERRING TO THE 
LABOUR PARTY THAT IS ANOTHER STAGE 
DAVID CAMERON HAS TO CROSS IT IT SEEMS EXTRAORDINARY BUT THE LAST 
TIME THE CONSERVATIVES GAINED A 
SEAT IN A BY ELECTION I WAS THERE 
AGE I WAS A SCHOOL SARAH BOYACK IT 
WAS TWENTY SIX YEARS AGO IN I I WAS WAS 
A SCHOOLBOY IT WAS TWENTY SIX YEARS AGO 
IT WAS ELEVEN DAYS BEFORE MRS. 
THATCHER DECLARED VICTORY OVER THE 
FALKLANDS CONSERVATIVES SAY THEY 
WILL FIGHT HARD IN CREWE AND THEY 
NEED WAS A THEY BECAUSE THEY 
DON'T WANT THE LIGHT AT THE END OF 
THE TUNNEL TO TURN INTO THE HEADS 
LAMPS OH SIX AN ONCOMING TRAIN WELL TO 
DISCUSS THAT IS THE CONSERVATIVES 
MICHAEL GOVE A PREDICTION ARE YOU 
GOING TO WIN 
I DON'T KNOW WE ARE 
GOING TO TRY VERY HARD WE WILL 
MAKE THE ARGUMENTS THAT THE PEOPLE 
OF CREWE WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE 
CHANGES THAT WE NEED TO MAKE IN 
SCHOOLS HOSPITALS AND ON CRIME L. 
HOPE THAT THE STRONG PERFORMANCE WE 
HAVE HAD IN THE LOCAL ELECTIONS 
WILL GIVE US THE SPRING BOARD BUT 
I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IS NOT 
TO CONCENTRATE ON MAKING PR DIXS 
BUT ON MAIRKING PREDICTION BUT 
MAKING ARGUMENTS 
YOU SHOULD WIN 
IT IS FOR YOU DECIDE WHO SHOULD OR 
SHOULD NOT IT IS FOR POLITICSS TO 
EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WHY THEY SHOULD 
SUPPORT US THE IMPORTANT THING 
ABOUT THE BY ELECTION IS THAT IT 
PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITIES TO 
OUTLINE OUR PROGRAMME TO EXPLAIN 
THAT WHEN ITS COPS TO EDUCATION 
THAT WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT 
THEIR CONCERNS WE HAVE IDEAS THAT 
WILL IMPROVE DISCIPLINE AND MAKE 
SCHOOL CHOICE A REALITY N. THE 
HEALTH SERVICE WE ARE ON THE SIDE 
OF THE PROFESSIONAL WHO IS HAVE HAD 
THEIR DECISIONS SECOND GUESSED BY 
THE GOVERNMENT THE GREAT THING 
ABOUT ELECTIONS IS THAT THEY 
PROVIDE THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO 
DISCUSS ISSUES AND PROVIDE YOU WITH 
AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACTS AS BUN DITS 
AND SHOUT THE PUNDIT AND SHOUT 
THE ODDS 
WOULD IT NOT BE CATASTROPHIC FOR 
YOU NOT TO WIN IT IN THE SENSE YOU 
HAVE NOT WON A BY ELECTION FOR TWENTY SIX 
YEARS LABOUR LABOUR WERE PILING 
UP MAJORITIES IN THE WIRRAL AND 
MID STAFFORDSHIRE IT WAS A SIGN 
THEY WERE ON COURSE TO WIN THE NEXT 
GENERAL ELECTION IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN DON'T YOU 
NEED TO DO THE SAME THING CREWE 
AND NANTWICH ARE RIPE FOR PICKING 
THAT IS WHAT YOU AND OTHER 
COMMENTATORS LOVE TALKING ABOUT 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONCENTRATE ON 
ACKNOWLEDGING YES THAT THE PUBLIC 
WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY HARRIET HARMAN 
POINTED OUT WE ARE ENTERING THAT 
STAGE IN THE LIFE TIME OF THIS 
PARLIAMENT WHEN PEOPLE ASK ABOUT 
CONSERVATIVE IDEAS THEY WANT TO 
KNOW HOW CONSERVATIVE IDEAS WILL 
MAKE DIFFERENCE IF THEY BELIEVE 
THAT OUR VALUES ARE RIGHT THEY WILL 
COME TO US THE RECENT LOCAL 
ELECTIONS SHOWED THAT PEOPLE ARE 
PROFOUNDLY UNHAPPY WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT THEY HAVE PASSED A 
JUDGMENT ON GORDON BROWN THAT HE 
IS A SALESMAN PASSING OFF DODGEY 
GOODS FOR THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS 
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE CHANGES 
ARE THAT DAVID CAMERON IS MAKING TO 
THE PARTY SUFFICIENT TO GIVE THEM 
CONFIDENCE SO THAT WE CAN FORM A 
GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT WE HEARD THE WOMAN SAYING SHE WOULD 
NOT VOTE CONSERVATIVE AS SHE WAS 
WORKING CLASS MARGARET THATCHER 
DID WELL AT APPEALING TO WORKING 
CLASS VOTERS 
DO YOU THINK THAT DAVID CAMERON 
BORIS JOHNSON ARE ALL GOING TO 
APPEAL TO WORKING CLASS VOTERS IN 
THE SAME WAY 
WELL DAVID CAMERON 
AND GEORGE OSBORNE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
LEADING THE PARTY HAVE BEEN 
APPEALING SUCCESSFULY TO THE 
WORKING CLASS VOTERS IN SURREY AND 
IN THE LAST LOCAL ELECTIONS L. 
THINK THAT THE IDEA OF LOOKING AT 
POLITICS THROUGH THE PRIS M. OF 
CLASS IS OUTDATED WHAT STRIKES ME 
AS ODD UNDER IRTHE LABOUR PARTY IS 
THAT THEY HAVE SMOVED BACK IN TIME 
ED BALLS SEEMS MORE INTERESTED IN 
CLASS WAR THAN WHAT GOES ON IN THE 
CLASSROOMS HE IS THE SORT OF 
PERSON THAT REPEATED THE RHETORIC 
THAT UE THAT YOU USED EARLIER I 
THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER IT 
IRRELEVANT I MAKE NO JUDGMENT ON 
ANYONE BASED ON WHERE THEY HAVE 
COME FROM L. THINK THAT IS OLD 
FASHIONED IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY GREAT 
BRITAIN PEOPLE'S BACKGROUND DOES 
NOT MATTER IT IS THE IDEAS 
YOU SOUND AS THOUGH YOU WELCOME THE 
FACT THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE 
SCRUTINY WITH THE POLICIES L. AM 
TEMPTED TO ASK WHAT IS THE BIG 
IDEA LABOUR PRE ONE HUNDRED NINETY NINE SEVEN A F. R. B. A 
PERIOD OF LONG OPPOSITION THERE 
WAS TO BE DEVOLUTION LORD'S REFORM 
MINIMUM WAGE WHAT HAVE YOU GOT 
THAT CAN EQUATE TO THAT 
WE ARE 
WORKING ON THE SIDE OF HARD WORKING 
PEOPLE WHO DO THE RIGHT THING 
I HAVE HEARD GORDON BROWN SAY THAT 
THIS MORNING HE IS ON THE SIDE OF 
HARD WORKING FAMILIES 
OF COURSE 
BUT THEY HAVE SEEN HIM INTRODUCE 
THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE THEY GOT 
RID OF IT THEY ARE ASKING US TO 
BELIEVE HE IS CAPABLE OF MAKING THE 
LONG TERM DECISIONS BUT WHEN YOU 
LOOK AT WHAT HE DID HE MADE A 
LONG TERM DECISION THEN ABANDONED 
IT IT WAS A DISASTER 
IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT EDUCATION 
POLICIES I CAN EXPLAIN HOW WE CAN 
TRANSFORMS SCHOOLS TRANSFORM 
SCHOOLS WE WILL ENSURE GENUINE 
CHOICE DIFFERENT PROVIDERS WHO 
CAN GUARANTEE WHETHER PARENTS WANT 
TO HAVE A PARTICULAR EDUCATION FOR 
THEIR CHILDREN WE WILL ENSURE THAT 
THE CHILDREN ARE READING AFTER TWO 
YEARS IN SCHOOLS SO WE END 
ILLITERACY ILLITERACY 
YOU POINTED OUT THAT WE IS IN HAVE INVITED YOU ON TO DISCUSS THIS 
BEFORE WE HAVE DISCUSSED THIS L. 
WANT TO TALK ABOUT OTHER SPECIFICS 
WHAT ABOUT THE TWO PENCE ADDITION 
ON FUEL DUTY SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT 
GO AHEAD GIVEN THE POSITION OF 
FAMILIES 
EVERY TAX QUESTION MUST FAMILIES BE LOOKED AT THROUGH THE FACT THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT ARE RE WRITING THEIR 
BUDGET IT IS INPROFEET FOR US TO 
SAY WHETHER WE CAN DO THIS OR THAT 
THIS IS COMING IN OCTOBER EXACTLY EXACTLY WE ARE ABLE TO OUTLINE BROAD THEMES 
AND AREAS WHERE WE LIKE TO REFORM 
IN EDUCATION WE HAVE IN HEALTH WE 
HAVE IN PRINCE WE HAVE YOU KNOW 
THE DELICATE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 
TAXING AND SPENDING QUESTIONS HAVE 
TO BE WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL WE 
SEE THE BOOKS 
ARE YOU GOING TO CUT INHERITANCE 
TAX 
ABSOLUTELY THERE ARE TWO TAX POSITIONS BOTH GIVE PEOPLE A FAIR 
INDICATION OF WHAT OUR VALUES ARE 
WE BELIEVE IN INHERITANCE TAX IT IS 
UNFAIR THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT 
MILLIONAIRES SHOULD BE PUNISHED IN 
THAT WAY WE SAID WE WOULD LIFT 
STAMP DUTY ON THOSE PEOPLE WHO WANT 
TO OWN THEIR OWN HOMES 
AND FINAL THOUGHT BORIS JOHNSON 
IS THIS THE LABORATORY ON WHICH WE 
SHOULD JUDGE WHAT A CONSERVATIVE 
ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE LIKE YES YES WHAT BORIS JOHNSON TALKS ABOUT 
CRIME TRANSPORT PROTECTING OUR 
SPACE TO MAKE IT SAFER FOR FAMILIES 
IS ON THE BUT THE ORCH HE IS 
CONCERNED HE HAS THE CONCERNS 
THAT I KNOW MOST CONSERVATIVES HAVE 
DO YOU HAVE UNEASE ABOUT THAT NO NO I HAVE NOT L. HAVE KNOWN BORIS FOR 
TWENTY YEARS HE DOES NOT FIT THE 
POLITICAL MOULD SO PEOPLE SAY HE 
IS RIDING FOR A FALL NONSENSE HE 
GOT IS ONE MILLION VOTES FROM PEOPLE 
WHO RECOGNISE THAT HIS PARTICULAR 
COMBINATION OF SERIOUS INT ELECT 
BUT LIKABILITY IS SOMETHING THAT 
HAS BEEN MISSING IN POLITICS FOR 
TOO LONG HE FOUGHT A CAMPAIGN IN 
WHICH HIS ISSUES WERE THE ISSUES 
THAT DOMINATED THE CONVERSATION 
FOR VIEWERS IN LONDON THERE IS MORE 
ON THE NEW LORD MAYOR BORIS 
JOHNSON FOR MORE INFORMATION VISIT 
THE WEBSITE AT 
FIRST THE POLITICS SHOW IN YOUR 
AREA 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELCOME ONCE 
AGAIN TO CITY HALL WHERE WE ASK 
TODAY HOW DID THAT HAPPEN SEISMIC 
CHANGE AT CITY HALL IT IS FROM 
MIDNIGHT THAT BORIS JOHNSON 
OFFICIALY TAKES OVER BUT HE IS UP 
THERE ON THE EIGHTH FLOOR PREPARING 
FOR THE CHANGE CLEARING THE EMPTY 
BOLTS OF CHAMPAGNE FROM THE OFFICE 
DECIDING ON THE COLOUR SCHEMES TO 
PUT ON HIS MOUSE MAP AND DOWN HERE 
WE ARE TRYING TO PREDICT WHAT IS IN 
STORE FOR LONDON WHAT IS GOING TO 
DEFINE A BORIS JOHNSON MAYORAL ALTY 
THIS REPORT CONTAINS SOME FLASH 
PHOTOGRAPHY PHOTOGRAPHY L. THEREFORE OFFICIALY DECLARE BORIS 
JOHNSON TO BE ELECTED AS THE NEXT 
MAYOR OF LONDON 
FOR THE CONSERVATIVES IT WAS A 
NIGHT TO REMEMBER GIVEN CONTROL OF 
CITY HALL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ITS 
SHORT HISTORY 
I KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE MANY 
WHOSE PENCILS HOVERED FOR AN 
INSTANT BEFORE PUTTING THEIR X. IN 
MY BOX 
SO WHO WERE THE LONDONERS WHO 
HANDED HIM THE VICTORY 
FOUR YEARS 
AGO IN THE LONDON ASSEMBLY 
ELECTIONS THE CONSERVATIVES 
OUTPOLLED LABOUR WHY DID KEN 
LIVINGSTONE RETAIN THE MAYOR IT 
WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS A KEN PREMIUM 
EIGHT PER CENT OF THE LONDONERS VOTED FOR KEN 
BUT NOT LABOUR THAT HAS GONE 
IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR BARNET AND AMP CAMDEN VOTED 
CONSERVATIVE BUT FOR KEN 
LIVINGSTONE AS THE MAYOR THIS 
THURSDAY THEY DID NOT BORIS 
JOHNSON CAME FIRST IN THE MIXED 
CONSTITUENCY WINNING TWELVE PER CENT MORE OF 
THE VOTE THAN STEPHEN NORRIS DID 
THE LAST TIME AROUND 
I DID NOT WANT KEN LIVINGSTONE TO 
WIN I HAD ENOUGH WITH THE 
CONGESTION CHARGE BUSINESSES 
PROMISES BUT NOTHING DELIVERED 
WHAT HAS BEEN DELIVERED THE CRIME 
RATE IS THE SAME IT HAS NOT GONE 
DOWN 
I THINK IT IS CRAZY THAT DOWN BORIS JOHNSON IS TO BE THE MAYOR OF 
LONDON I CAN'T BELIEVE WE ARE AT 
THIS POINT 
IT IS THE END OF A RUN FOR ONE OF 
LONDON'S MOST CHARISMATIC 
POLITICIANS IT IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE 
CALLING THE BLUE DOUGHNUT 
ONE OF KEN'S WEAKNESSES IS HAVING 
SPENT TIME MORE IN VENEZUELA THAN 
IN LONDON BORE ROUINGS 
SO WITH A NEW MAYOR IN PLACE WHAT 
DIFFERENCE WITH THE LONDONERS 
NOTICE AT PRIME MINISTER'S 
QUESTIONS S. 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MAYOR 
AND CENTRAL GOVERNMENT MAY BE MORE 
FRAUGHT FRAUGHT THE ONE THING THAT WOULD PUT THE 
POLICING OF LONDON AT RISK IS THE 
ELECTION OF CONSERVATIVE MAYOR 
BUT THERE COULD BE BETTER LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT THERE WERE TIMES WHEN KEN 
LIVINGSTONE DECIDED THE BEST WAY OF 
OPERATING WERE TO ATTACK THE 
BROGUES THAT WAS NOT THE BEST WAY 
TO OUR MIND 
BORIS JOHNSON HAS PROMISED TO WORK 
IN A MORE FRIENDLY WAY 
A LOFT HIS GUIDE RESTS HE IS A 
DETAILED MAN 
THERE HAS BEEN SPECULATION ABOUT 
WHO THAT MAY BE SOME PEOPLE WHOSE 
NAMES MENTIONED SEEM CONNEX SOUTH 
EASTERN THAN OTHERS 
I F. HE ASKED ME TO IT WORKS FOR ME 
IT WORKS FOR HIM I WOULD BE HAPPY 
TO JOIN HIM 
IF BORIS JOHNSON CALLED YOU UP 
WOULD YOU HAVE A FLAT NO 
NO NOT A 
CHANCE CHANCE A FLAT NO 
THERE HAS BEEN SPECULATION ABOUT 
THE MORE SERIOUS TONE ADOPTED BY 
BORIS JOHNSON IN THE COURSE OF THE 
CAMPAIGN BUT WILL HE KEEP IT AFTER 
THE ELECTION 
PEOPLE HAVE TO FORGET THE IDEA OF A 
GAFFE PRONE HE HAS PROVED HE IS A 
VERY SERIOUS GUY WHO INTENDS TO DO 
A VERY SERIOUS JOB 
A LAST MINUTE 
BOOBY TRAP 
WITHOUT A RECORD OF 
GOVERNMENT OF RUNNING LARGE 
DEPARTMENTS OR HANDLING MULTI 
MILLION POUND BUDGETS THE TRUTH IS 
IT IS HARD TO PREDICT WHAT SORT OF 
MAYOR BORIS JOHNSON IS GOING TO 
BECOME BECOME HERE AT CITY HALL I AM JOINED BY 
JIM FITZPATRICK THE LABOUR 
TRANSPORT MINISTER BOB NEIL THE 
SHADOW MINISTER FOR THE 
CONSERVATIVES IN LONDON LYNN 
FEATHER STONE 
AND TONY TRAVIS WHO FEELS LIKE 
STARTING LET'S EXPLAIN THIS HOW 
DID IT HAPPEN KEN LIVINGSTONE RAN 
AHEAD FROM LABOUR HE HAD THE 
PERSONAL VOTE BUT DID NOT RUN HARD 
ENOUGH IS HE TO BLAME 
IN HIS 
SPEECH IN THIS HALL HE DID TAKE ALL 
THE BLAME THAT IS A GOOD THING TO 
DO I THINK HE WAS VERY GRACIOUS IN 
HIS DEFEAT THE TRUTH IS IT IS 
PROBABLY NOT ALL OF HIS FAULT WHAT 
HAPPENED THURSDAY NIGHT FRIDAY 
MORNING IS THAT SPWUN LONDON THIS 
IS TRUE OUTSIDE OF LONDON 
SUBURBAN LONDON REVOLTED 
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK HE WAS THE 
AUTHOR THOUGH HIMSELF OF HIS 
MISFORTUNE COULD HE HAVE DONE 
MORE 
BEING IN POWER A LONG TIME AS MORE BAD EFEPBGTS THERE IS NO QUESTION 
THAT SOME OF THE ACCUSATIONS OF 
CRONYISM AND SOME OF THE STYLE OF 
GOVERNMENT BECAME AS IF THEY 
THOUGHT THEY COULD NEVER LOSE IF 
ONE WERE GOING TO GIVE ONE PIECE OF 
ADVICE TO A NEW MAYOR IT WOULD BE 
TO OPERATE THE SYSTEM OF MAYOR IN A 
RATHER MORE FRIENDLY AND OPEN WAY 
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MINUTE 
ON WHAT WE EXPECT THE NEW STYLE TO 
BE BUT JIM FITZPATRICK DIING TO 
HEAR WHERE YOU FOUND THE SILVER 
LINING ON THIS ONE 
I KNOW THERE IS 
AN EXPECKATION IN THE MEDIA WE HAVE 
TO PUT A GLOSS ON BUT IT WAS A 
VERY BAD THURSDAY FRIDAY SATURDAY 
WAS NOT AS BAD AS FRIDAY SUNDAY 
WE ARE HERE IN LONDON WITH THE SUN 
SHINING SHINING COULD HE EVER HAVE WON THIS ONE 
KEN LIVINGSTONE GIVEN THE NATIONAL 
PICTURE 
NO AS TONY SAYS THE PICTURE NATIONAL PICTURE WAS PLAYING 
AGAINST HIM ESPECIALLY IN THE 
OUTER BORE ROUINGS HE WAS MAINGNAM 
MOUSE IN THE WAY HE ACCEPTED DEFEAT 
ON THE CHIN 
HE IS VERY INDEPENDENT IN THE 
LABOUR PARTY 
HE WAS BEING TOO 
MAING NAN MOUSE THE THIRD FACTOR 
IN RESPECT OF KEN IS THE FACT THAT 
IN CREATING THE MAYOR WE CREATED 
PERSONAL POLITICS SO THERE WAS 
ALWAYS THAT DIMENSION 
HE DID NOT COME UP TO THE PLATE 
AFTER EIGHT YEARS AS MAYOR THE 
GLOSS RUBS OFF THE NEW MAYOR COMES 
IN BORIS JOHNSON IS A PERSONALITY 
THAT MAY HAVE MADE UP FIVE PER CENT OR SO PER CENT 
THAT THREE FACTORS COMBINED AND 
MOSTLY THE NATION WANTING TO GIVE 
THE GOVERNMENT A KICKING THAT IS 
WHY KEN LIVINGSTONE LOST 
BOB SURPRISE ARE YOU SURPRISED 
I THOUGHT WE HAD CHANCE IT HAS 
COME OUT BETTER THAN MANY PREDICTED 
DOWN TO BORIS JOHNSON'S CAMPAIGN 
WHICH WAS FOCUSED AND SERIOUS IT 
WAS THE POINT MADE IN THE PIECE 
BORIS JOHNSON DEMONSTRATED TO A LOT 
OF PEOPLE WHO DID NOT THINK THAT 
HE WAS A SERIOUS GUY 
WERE YOU CONVINCED HE COULD DO IT 
AFTER MY FIRST OR SECOND MEETING L. 
WAS CONSCIOUS THAT THIS GUY REALLY 
WAS A QUICK LEARNER 
I'M HAPPY TO SAY I WAS THERE FIRST 
WHAT IS THE KEY THING FOR THE 
PUBLIC IT TOOK LONG TIME THOSE 
WHO WERE WORKING WITH HIM KNEW 
DFRPBTLY BUT IT TOOK TIME DURING 
THE CAMPAIGN WHERE THERE WAS 
EXPOSURE ON THE CADS FOR THAT 
MESSAGE TO GET ACROSS YOU HAVE 
MIXTURE OF FACT THAT HE WAS SEEN AS 
SOMEBODY WHO WOULD BE DIFFERENT AND 
THERE WAS REAL FEELING IT WAS 
TIME FOR A CHANGE T. PROBLEM THAT 
LABOUR HAD A FINAL POINT IS THIS 
IT IS NOT JUST THE MAYOR RESULT 
THE CONSERVATIVES WON ELEVEN SEATS 
ON THE ASSEMBLY IT IS BIG SWING 
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE ASSEMBLY 
YET LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BIG 
PLAYERS IN YOUR CASE NOT VERY 
BIG PLAYER OH MY GOD WHAT 
HAPPENED 
WE WERE SQUEEZED BY HAPPENED CELEBRITY 
AND YOUR OWN INEPTITUDE CELEBRITY NO HE WAS A GOOD HE SAID HE WAS 
TALENTED AMATEUR HE HAD SOME GOOD 
POLICY BUT HE WAS AGAINST TWO OLD 
STAGERS WHO WERE SLUGGING IT OUT 
AND HE WAS YOU KNOW A SOMEONE 
DESCRIBED HIM AS GOOSE BERRY IT IT WAS SAD THEY COULD NOT COME UP WITH 
ANYONE TO MATCH THAT 
WE THOUGHT HE 
WAS EXCELLENT 
MAYBE VINCE CABLE 
YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT L. THINK 
BRIAN WAS AN EXCELLENT CANDIDATE 
AN ASSISTANTS COMMISSIONER FOR 
POLICE X. ON CRIME HE COULD NOT BE 
TOUCHED THIS WAS ABOUT HOW MANY 
PEOPLE KNOW THE NAME AND WANTING A 
LAUGH FROM THE CHEEKY CHAPY TO 
BORIS THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING 
AROUND VEBTY CELEBRITY IN THE 
NATION THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS DID 
WELL 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS NLY WELL GOT THREE SEATS IN THE ASSEMBLY 
THE EFFECT OF BRIAN PADDICK BEING 
SO 
IT WAS DISA POINTED BUT THE SO NATIONAL PICTURE WAS THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS DID WELL 
NOW THE WINNER 
AND WE CAN CAN EXPECT DO WE EXPECT 
CO YOU EXPECT MUCH TO SEEM VERY 
DIFFERENT IN THE IMMEDIATE WEEKS 
AND HOW CRUCIAL IS THIS FIRST TEAM 
THE ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT WHO WILL BE 
AROUND HIM 
IT IS IMPORTANT AS WE 
HAVE HEARD EVEN BORIS' FRIENDS 
DON'T SEE HIM AS A DETAIL MAN BUT 
TONY BLAIR DIDN'T DO DETAIL BUT HE 
WAS EFFECTIVE AS A PRIME MINISTER 
BUT HE WILL BE IN CONTRAST TO KEN 
LIVINGSTONE HE HAD A 
PHENOMENONAL 
POSSIBLY THE BEST PHENOMENONAL DETAILED POLITICIAN 
DID PEOPLE 
APPRECIATE THAT FACT WHAT A FIGURE 
HE WAS 
FOR PEOPLE ON THE LEFT I 
THINK THEY ARE GOING TO ARGUE 
WHETHER HE OR HERBERT MORRISSON WAS 
THE GREATEST LONDON POLITICIAN EVER 
COME BACK TO BORIS THE PEOPLE WHO 
HE APPOINTS WILL BE ABSOLUTELY 
ESSENTIAL BUT AS MAYOR BECAUSE 
THE LABOUR PARTY TALKED HIM DOWN SO 
MUCH HE HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF 
STARTING OFFICE WITH NO 
EXPECTATIONS HE CAN ONLY BE DEBE 
TER EVERYONE NOTED WHEN 
WHAT ABOUT IN TERMS OF POLICY 
HANDS UP ANYONE WHO THINKING WE 
WILL SEE A NEW ROUTE MASTER IN FOUR 
YEARS' TIME 
I WILL PUT MY HAND UP 
FOR THAT 
HANDS UP IF YOU THINK THERE WILL BE 
A NO STRIKE AGREEMENT WITH THE RAIL 
MARITIME AND TRANSPORT UNION YOU YOU HAVE TO AGREE WITH IT 
I DO THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE 
SHOULD BE DOING IT REQUIRE AS 
NEGOTIATION NEGOTIATION OF COURSE IT DOES 
THE UNIONS HAVE TO REMEMBER IF THEY 
WANT TO BE OBSTRUCTIVE THIS IS A 
MAYOR WHO HAS THE MANDATE OF OVER ONE 
MILLION LONDONERS VOTING FOR HIM 
WHEN IT COMES TO THE NEGOTIATIONS 
HE IS IN A STRONG POSITION HIS 
MORAL AUTHORITY IS STRONG BECAUSE 
OF THAT MANDATE THEY HAVE TO TAKE 
THAT ON BOARD OTHERWISE THEY ARE 
PAINTING THEMSELVES INTO THE 
PICTURE 
REMEMBER WE HAVE TWO PICTURE YEARS TO THE NEXT ELECTION A 
NUMBER OF LONDON SEATS WHERE LABOUR 
WILL BE WORRIED CAN YOU TAKE 
COMFORT THAT WE WILL SEE THE 
EXPERIENCE OF A CONSERVATIVE 
ADMINISTRATION THERE IS REAL 
POLITICS BACK HERE PERHAPS IT DOES 
NOT DO YOU HARM TO BE IN OPPOSITION 
FOR A WHILE 
I THINK THERE IS AN 
ELEMENT OF THAT ALTHOUGH TONY'S 
POINTS OF PLAYING DOWN BORIS 
JOHNSON'S EXPECKATIONS THAT HE MAY 
NOT ACHIEVE MUCH AT ALL THAT WE 
COULD BOX OURSELVES IN TO A CORNER 
THERE BUT OBVIOUSLY ANY POLITICIAN 
WHEN THE PARTY SUFFERS THE SETBACK 
THAT WE SUFFERED ON THURSDAY WILL 
LOOK AND SAY WE HAVE A VERY BIG 
TASK AHEAD OF US WE DO BELIEVE 
HOWEVER THAT WE CAN RIDE OUT THE 
ECONOMIC STORM THAT THE BRITISH 
ECONOMY IS STABLE THAT THE 
INVESTMENT WE MADE IN THE PUBLIC 
SERVICES PUTS NEWS A STRONG 
POSITION IN SIX MONTHS TIME TO LOOK 
BACK AND SAY IT WAS A LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT THAT KEPT US FLOUING 
THAT THROUGH THAT 
DO YOU SEE KEN 
LIVINGSTONE AS GREAT MAYOR I I THINK WE WILL LOOK BACK AT HIM AS A 
VERY SIGNIFICANT FIGURE WITH HIM 
BEING GONE I DID NOT FIND HIS 
POLICIES SO OBJECTIONABLE I WILL 
BE LOOKING TO SEE BORBS BORES BORES 
TAKING US FORWARD NOT BACK BUT HE 
WAS VERY DIVISIVE AMONG PEOPLE IF 
I WANT ANYTHING I WANT BORIS TO 
REUNITE US 
WE WILL COME BACK TO MORE IN A 
MOMENT MOMENT IT IS CLEAR THAT THE LONDON VOTE 
PRESSURES ENERGISED BY THE ELECTION 
CAMPAIGN THE BATTLE OF KEN AND 
BORIS NOT BRIAN VERY MUCH GIVEN 
THAT HALF MILLION MORE LONDONERS 
VOTED THIS TIME THE SUBURBS DID 
SPEAK SO DID LONDON'S MAIN 
NEWSPAPER IN INCREASINGLY SHRILL 
TONES TONES IF THE CAMPAIGN WAS ABOUT 
PERSONALLITIES AS MUCH AS POLITICS 
THEN THE ACCOMPANYING MEDIA HYPE 
SERVED TO STIMULATE LONDON'S 
INTEREST IN THE ELECTORATE IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
THE TURN OUT WAS FOUR HUNDRED NINETY NINE PER CENT BUT THIS 
WEEK FORTY THREE THREE FERZ PUT THEIR CROSSES 
AGAINST THE NAMES HOWEVER IT WAS 
NOT WITHOUT CONTROVERSY NOT SINCE 
NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHEN THE SUN NEWSPAPERER 
VOTED THAT IT WAS THE SUN THAT WON 
IT HAS NEWSPAPER BOOSTED ABOUT 
THEIR HELP IN THE ELECTION 
WE SAID THAT THE LONDON LORD 
MAYOR IS REPRESENTATIVE OF MILLIONS 
OF LONDONERS IT IS NOT TOY ROLE 
WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A CON 
TEMPT RELATIONSHIP WITH IT SAYING 
THAT EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT 
HOWEVER THE LABOUR HIGH COMMAND 
VOICED THEIR DISAPPROVAL 
KEN HAS BEEN ON THE RECEIVING END 
OF A VITRIOLIC CAMPAIGN AGAINST HIM 
FROM THE EVENING STANDARD 
THE POLLING COMPANY USED U. GOV WAS 
ATTACKED BY KEN LIVINGSTONE ON 
TUESDAY SPOKES PERSON FOR THE KEN 
LIVINGSTONE CAMPAIGN SAID 
THE 
LIVINGSTONE CAMPAIGN SAID THE FINAL RESULTS SEEMED TO VINDICATE 
THE POLLING 
THE TELEVISION POLLS HAVE 
CONSISTENTLY OVER THE LAST TEN 
YEARS OR SO OVERSTATED LABOUR 
SUPPORT OR KEN LIVINGSTONE SUPPORT 
IN LONDON AND UNDERSTATED 
CONSERVATIVE SUPPORT THEY ARE GOOD 
PEOPLE THEY WILL HAVE TRIED TO PUT 
IT RIGHT 
THE CLAIMS MADE BY THE STANDARD ON 
THEIR ROLE ON KEN LIVINGSTONE'S 
DOUBTFUL MUST BE CONSIDERED IN THE 
LIGHT OF LABOUR'S CATASTROPHIC 
NATIONAL SHOWING AND OF THE 
INCOMING MAYOR BUT IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO DISPUTE ON THEIR DRAWING DOWN ON 
THE CURTAIN OF THE KEN LIVINGSTONE 
ERA 
THE CURTAIN OF THE KEN LIVINGSTONE ERA 
KEN LIVINGSTONE HAS MANAGED TO RIDE 
OPPOSITION FOR THAT PAPER FOR 
LONG TIME DID YOU THINK IT DID 
MAKE DIFFERENCE 
IT FELL AS 
THOUGH IT WAS MAKING A 
DIFFERENCE 
THOUGH IT WAS MAKING A DIFFERENCE PROBABLY THE OUTER LONDON AREA LOOK 
AT THE STANDARD MORE THAN PEOPLE IN 
INNER LONDON 
DO YOU THINK IT WAS 
FAIR 
THE ATTACKS ON KEN FAIR INTENSIFIED AND THE COVERAGE THAT 
HE GOT WAS TOXIC L. THINK THEY 
DECIDED THAT THIS WAS THEIR 
OPPORTUNITY GIVEN THE AN A TAG 
NISM THEY HAVE HAD WITH KEN OVER 
THE YEARS IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
STATE THEIR CASE AS STRONGLY AS 
THEY COULD 
DO YOU FEEL ANY UNEASE 
ABOUT THAT COVERAGE FOR A PAIP TO 
SEEM SO PARTISAN 
I THINK JIM IS 
MORE BALANCE THAN THE SOUR GRAPES 
FROM KEN'S CAMP IT IS THIS YES 
THE STANDARD MADE IT CLEAR WHERE IT 
WAS COMING FROM BUT SOME OF THAT 
KEN HAD BROUGHT UPON HIMSELF HE 
DID GIVE THEM AMMUNITION AND HE DID 
NOT GET ON TOP WITH WHAT WAS GOING 
ON WITH HIS ADVISORS 
HOW IMPORTANT 
WILL IT BE THAT STANDARD AT THE 
MOMENT IT WILL STAY ON SIDE HOW 
IMPORTANT WILL THAT BE FOR BORIS 
JOHNSON 
THE STANDARD IS THE MAIN JOHNSON LONDON NEWSPAPER IT IS READ BY ALL 
THE OTHER NEWSPAPERS THE THING 
ABOUT THE STANDARDS EVERY 
JOURNALIST IN LONDON READS IT 
WITHOUT QUESTION THE EFFECT OF IT 
WAS TO CASCADE INTO EVEN THE 
GUARDSIAN WHICH SET ITSELF UP TO 
DEFEND KEN L. THINK THAT I ASSUME 
THEY WERE NOW LOOK AT BORIS JOHNSON 
REASONABLY CRITICALLY THEY SHOULD 
DO BECAUSE IS WHAT THE PRESS 
SHOULD CO DO 
CO DO YOU THINK 
BORIS JOHNSON MAY SURPRISE PEOPLE 
AND BE SUCCESSFUL 
NO I THINK HE 
WILL MAKE A GOOD START AND THE REAL 
BORIS 
WILL COME THROUGH L. L. THINK IT WILL BE DOWN TO POLICY IN THE END 
I DON'T THINK THE WAY BORIS IS 
GOING TO DELIVER AN IMPROVED LONDON 
HOW DO YOU THINK WE WILL JUDGE HIM 
IN A YEAR'S TIME 
WE SHOULD JUDGE 
HIM IF THERE IS A STYLE THAT IS 
DIFFERENT BUT BY AND LARGE PUBLIC 
SERVICES EITHER DON'T GET WORSE OR 
GET BETTER L. THINK WE DO USE THESE 
SERVICES EACH DAY IT IS THE BUS 
IF THEY GET WORSE WE WILL NOTICE 
SO HE NEEDS TO SEAT DIFFERENT STYLE 
AND MAKE SURE PUBLIC SERVICES AND 
HE HAS REMEMBER HE HAS HAD A HUGE 
INVESTMENT PROGRAMME TO MANAGE 
THIS IS GOING TO BE THEME I 
THINK WE ARE GOING TO BE RETURNING 
TO THANK YOU WITH THAT IT IS BACK 
TO YOU 
BEFORE WE GO YOU WILL BE AWARE 
THERE IS A RE VIEW OF M. P.S' EXPENSES 
EFFECT EXPECTED WE ASKED YOU TO 
LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THU ABOUT 
THOUGHT ABOUT IT WE INVITED A TEAM 
OF VIEWERS TO WESTMINSTER TO RRY 
OUT THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION SIMON 
HAS BEEN LISTENING TO THEIR VIEWS 
I THINK BASICALLY M. P.'S SHOULD GET 
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE SALARY 
I 
I OBJECT TO THEM BEING ABLE TO BUY A 
HOUSE THEN PICK UP THE PROFITS ON 
OCCASIONS THEY WILL NOT MAKE MONEY 
BUT IT IS NOT THEIRS 
WHEY DON'T 
SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IS THE REVIEW I 
CAN TAKING PLACE THEY DOING IT 
THEMSELVES NOW ANY COMMON SENSE 
WORLD CAN THE VOTER LOOK AT THAT 
AND SAY YES THAT IS A TRUE REVIEW 
OF THE SALARIES 
FIND OUT HOW THEY 
GET ON NEXT WEEK THAT IS ALL FOR 
TODAY THANK YOU FOR 
BEING US WITH 
IF YOU WANT TO GET IN TOUCH T. 
ADDRESS ON SCREEN IS THERE NOW BYE 
BYE
