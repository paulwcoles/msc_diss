TWO PRESENTS FOR MY VERY GOOD FRIENDS 
FRIENDS NEED EACH OTHER 
LIKE A BOOK NEEDS ITS COVER 
LIKE BALLOONS NEED AIR 
LIKE A TABLE NEEDS A CHAIR 
FRIENDS FIT TOGETHER 
LIKE BIRDS OF A FEATHER 
THEY'RE THE FINGERS ON YOUR HAND 
THEY'RE THE PLAYERS IN A BAND 
SOMETIMES IT'S TRUE THAT FRIENDS CAN FIGHT 
THE FRIENDS BREAK APART LIKE DAY AND NIGHT 
BUT COME THE DAWN A BRAND NEW DAY 
YOU'RE FRIENDS ONCE AGAIN AND YOU'RE READY TO PLAY 
FRIENDS LOVE TO PLAY 
TO PLAY THE HOURS AWAY 
LIKE A KITTEN WITH SOME STRING 
LIKE A BIRD THAT LOVES TO SING 
FRIENDS HELP EACH OTHER 
IT REALLY IS NO BOTHER 
LIKE THE RAIN FEEDS THE LAND 
LIKE THE SEA CLEANS THE SAND 
SOMETIMES A FRIEND MAY BE ALL ALONE 
WITH NO ONE TO TALK TO NO ONE TO PHONE 
BUT DON'T FEEL SAD DON'T FEEL BLUE 
SOMEONE SOMEWHERE'S THINKING OF YOU 
FRIENDS NEED EACH OTHER 
LIKE A BOOK NEEDS ITS COVER 
LIKE BALLOONS NEED AIR 
LIKE A TABLE NEEDS ITS CHAIR 
FRIENDS FIT TOGETHER 
LIKE BIRDS OF A FEATHER 
THEY'RE THE FINGERS ON YOUR HAND 
THEY'RE THE PLAYERS IN A BAND 
FRIENDS FOREVER 
FOR EVERMORE 
AH I'M GLAD I'VE GOT SUCH GOOD FRIENDS 
WHAT WOULD WE DO WITHOUT YOU 
AHA 
NOW THERE'S A LITTLE DOG IN TODAY'S STORY 
WHO'S GLAD TO HAVE A FRIEND 
TIKKABILLA TOCKABILLA 
TIKKABILLA TOCK 
WHAT'S THE TIME ON THE TIKKABILLA CLOCK 
THE LONG HAND IS POINTING DOWN TO THE NUMBER SIX 
THAT MEANS IT'S HALF PAST SOMETHING 
AND THE SHORT HAND HAS GONE PAST THE NUMBER TEN 
THAT MEANS IT'S HALF PAST TEN 
BUT WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE CLOCK 
OOH IT'S A LITTLE RIVER 
TODAY'S STORY IS CALLED YOU'RE SAFE NOW WATER DOG 
WATT THE DOG AND MATT WERE ALWAYS TOGETHER 
THEY PLAYED TOGETHER THEY WENT SHOPPING TOGETHER 
THEY CURLED UP IN THE SAME BED TOGETHER 
MATT TOOK WATT EVERYWHERE 
EXPLORING CLIMBING 
EVEN TO SCHOOL 
BUT AS MATT GREW UP 
HE BEGAN TO FORGET ABOUT WATT THE DOG 
SO SOMETIMES WATT STAYED AT HOME WHEN MATT WENT OUT ON HIS BICYCLE 
OR SAT CRAMPED IN A DUSTY CORNER WHEN MATT GOT INTO BED 
ONE DAY AFTER MATT HAD BEEN OUT PLAYING WITH HIS FRIENDS 
WATT WAS LEFT BEHIND ON THE RIVERBANK 
AND NO ONE CAME BACK TO LOOK FOR HIM 
WATT LAY ALL ALONE BESIDE THE RIVER 
OWLS HOOTED IN THE TREETOPS 
AND A FOX SNIFFED AT WATT 
BEFORE SLINKING AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS 
THEN IT BEGAN TO RAIN RAIN FELL ON THE WOODS AND FIELDS 
RAIN FILLED THE DITCHES AND POURED INTO THE RIVER 
UNTIL THE WATER SWIRLED AROUND WATT 
LIFTING HIM UP AND CARRYING HIM AWAY 
SPINNING AND DUCKING WATT THE WATER DOG DRIFTED DOWNSTREAM 
PAST HERDS OF STARING COWS 
PASTS FARMS AND FISHERMEN 
THROUGH VILLAGES UNDER BRIDGES 
AT FIRST HE FLOATED WELL 
BUT THE LONGER HIS JOURNEY LASTED 
THE COLDER AND SOGGIER HE GOT 
UNTIL ONLY HIS HEAD WAS LEFT BOBBING ABOVE THE SURFACE 
HATTIE WAS SPLASHING ABOUT TRYING TO SCOOP UP LEAVES 
WHEN WATT DRIFTED PAST 
SHE REACHED OUT WITH HER NET BUT MISSED 
SHE REACHED AGAIN AND MISSED AGAIN 
BUT THE THIRD TIME SHE STRETCHED JUST FAR ENOUGH 
TO LIFT WATT OUT OF THE WATER AND CARRY HIM PROUDLY HOME 
LOOK A WATER DOG 
WATT LAY IN FRONT OF A WARM FIRE GENTLY STEAMING 
WHEN HE WAS DRY HE SAT AT THE TABLE WHILE HATTIE ATE HER SUPPER 
AT BEDTIME HATTIE CARRIED WATT TO HER ROOM 
AND TUCKED HIM INTO A SHOEBOX ON HER BEDSIDE TABLE 
BUT WHEN THE LIGHT WAS OUT AND THE DOOR WAS CLOSED 
SHE LIFTED HIM OUT OF THE BOX 
YOU'RE SAFE NOW WATER DOG SHE WHISPERED 
AND SHE HUGGED HIM TIGHT 
AND FELL ASLEEP WITH WATT THE WATER DOG CUDDLED IN HER ARMS 
OH I'M GLAD THAT WATT FOUND A NEW FRIEND 
AND I'M GLAD THAT HE'S NOT IN THAT RIVER ANY MORE 
RIVERS CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS PLACES 
SO YOU SHOULD NEVER GO NEAR THE WATER WITHOUT A GROWN UP 
AH 
YOU CAN SEE SOME RIVERS AND STREAMS THROUGH THE WINDOWS TODAY 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AND SEE 
HOW MANY WINDOWS 
ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
IT'S THE 
SQUARE WINDOW 
THIS IS A BIG STREAM 
LISTEN TO THE SOUND IT MAKES 
LOTS OF ANIMALS LIVE IN STREAMS 
THIS BIRD IS CALLED A DIPPER 
BECAUSE IT DIPS DOWN INTO THE WATER TO LOOK FOR LITTLE ANIMALS TO EAT 
WHEN A STREAM GETS EVEN BIGGER 
IT IS CALLED A RIVER 
RIVERS ARE MUCH DEEPER AND WIDER THAN STREAMS 
AND THIS IS A WATERFALL 
THE WATER IS FALLING DOWN OVER A BIG ROCK 
LOOK AT ALL THAT WATER CRASHING DOWN 
THE RIVER IS FLOWING MORE GENTLY NOW 
THERE ARE FISH HERE 
THESE ARE SALMON 
AND THESE LITTLE CREATURES ARE WATER VOLES 
THEY MAKE THEIR HOMES IN THE SIDES OF THE RIVER 
THE SIDES OF A RIVER ARE CALLED RIVERBANKS 
THERE ARE BIRDS LIVING ON THE RIVER TOO LIKE DUCKS 
SWANS AND HERONS 
WHICH FIND LOTS OF FOOD TO EAT 
WHEN THE RIVER REACHES THE END OF ITS JOURNEY 
IT FLOWS INTO THE SEA 
YOU COULD SEE CLEARLY THOSE RIVERS AND STREAMS RUNNING OVERGROUND 
BUT DID YOU KNOW YOU CAN GET UNDERGROUND RIVERS 
AND WE GET OUR WATER FROM AN UNDERGROUND RIVER FROM A WELL 
SOMETIMES CALLED A WISHING WELL 
ONCE I SAW A WISHING WELL 
HIGH UPON A HILL 
I LOOKED INTO THE DEEP DARK HOLE 
THE WATER WAS QUITE STILL 
I PUT MY HAND INTO MY POCKET 
AND FOUND A SHINY PENNY 
I CLOSED MY EYES TO MAKE A WISH 
BUT COULDN'T THINK OF ANY 
I THOUGHT AND THOUGHT AND THOUGHT AND THOUGHT 
IT TOOK ME QUITE A WHILE 
BUT NOTHING CAME INTO MY HEAD 
NOTHING MADE ME SMILE 
PERHAPS A BRAND NEW CAR 
AN AEROPLANE WITH MASSIVE WINGS 
WOULD HELP ME TRAVEL FAR 
BUT JUST BEFORE I DROPPED MY COIN 
I STOPPED AND LOOKED ABOUT 
I CLOSED MY EYES AND THOUGHT OF THINGS 
I COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT 
I THREW MY COIN INTO THE HOLE 
AND DOWN IT SWIFTLY FELL 
WHOOOOOOOOOO 
SPLASH I HEARD A DISTANT SPLISH AND SPLASH 
FROM DEEP WITHIN THE WELL 
AND WHAT DID I WISH FOR 
FOR LAZY DAYS AND STARRY NIGHTS 
FOR PLAYING WITH MY FRIENDS 
FOR PARTIES FAIRS AND HOLIDAYS 
THAT NEVER EVER END 
THERE ARE PROBABLY LOTS OF COINS AT THE BOTTOM OF A WISHING WELL 
AND YOU CAN THROW ANY COIN YOU WISH DOWN THERE 
IT CAN BE BIG COINS OR SMALL COINS 
SILVER COINS OR COPPER COINS 
OLD COINS 
OR NEW COINS 
MAYBE WE'LL SEE SOME MORE COINS THROUGH THE WINDOWS 
HOW MANY WINDOWS 
ONE TWO THREE 
ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED 
WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
IT'S THE 
ROUND WINDOW 
THIS BUILDING IS WHERE ALL THE COINS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ARE MADE 
OR MINTED AS IT'S CALLED 
THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DO WHEN YOU MINT A COIN 
IS TO CUT THE RIGHT SHAPE OUT OF A METAL SHEET 
THIS MACHINE CAN CUT OUT SIX HUNDRED COIN SHAPES EVERY MINUTE 
BUT YOU CAN'T SPEND THESE SHAPES IN THE SHOP YET 
BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST METAL DISCS CALLED BLANKS AT THE MOMENT 
IF YOU LOOK ON ANY UNITED KINGDOM COIN 
YOU WILL SEE A PICTURE ON BOTH SIDES 
THIS MACHINE USES A REALLY SHARP TOOL 
TO CUT A THING CALLED A DIE 
WHICH IS USED TO STAMP THE PICTURE ONTO THE COINS 
THOUSANDS OF METAL DISCS OR BLANKS 
ARE POURED INTO THE STAMPING MACHINE 
READY TO BE TURNED INTO A FINISHED COIN 
WHEN THEY ARE ALL LINED UP 
THIS MACHINE STAMPS A PICTURE ONTO THE COIN 
LOOK THEY ARE MINTING FIFTY PENCE COINS 
WHAT A LOT OF COINS 
TONY CHECKS THE COINS TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THE PICTURE IS IN PERFECT CONDITION 
WHEN TONY'S HAPPY THAT THE COINS HAVE BEEN PROPERLY MINTED 
HE SENDS A BUCKETLOAD TO THE COUNTING MACHINE 
THEY PUT FIVE HUNDRED COINS IN EVERY BAG 
THE BAGS ARE THEN SEALED AND WEIGHED 
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF COINS ARE IN EACH BAG 
YOU COULD BUY A LOT WITH THAT 
I'VE GOT SOME COINS HERE 
I'VE GOT A ONE PENCE COIN AND A TWO PENCE COIN 
FIVE PENCE COIN A TEN PENCE COIN 
AND A FIFTY PENCE COIN LIKE THE ONES WE SAW THROUGH THE WINDOWS 
I HAVE DECIDED TO MAKE SOMETHING TO PUT THESE COINS IN 
I'M GONNA MAKE IT AS A PRESENT FOR TAMBA 
DO YOU REMEMBER TAMBA GAVE ME A PRESENT 
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A MONEY BOX 
AND I'VE GOT TWO EMPTY TEABAG BOXES HERE 
WHICH I'M GOING TO STICK TOGETHER WITH SOME STICKY TAPE 
JUST STICK IT ON THE TOP HERE LIKE THAT 
SO THEY'RE JOINED TOGETHER 
AND THEN A LITTLE BIT MORE STICKY TAPE 
I'M GOING TO DO IT AT THE BACK LIKE THIS 
THERE WE ARE 
NOW I'M GONNA COVER THESE TEABAG BOXES 
WITH SOME NICE BRIGHT YELLOW PAPER 
STICK IT DOWN WITH SOME STICKY TAPE AGAIN 
AND A LITTLE BIT MORE 
SO NOW WE'VE GOT A NICE BRIGHT YELLOW BOX 
HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE 
NOW THIS IS GONNA BE A HOUSE 
SO I'LL HAVE TO DRAW A WINDOW AND A DOOR 
I'LL PUT ONE DOOR ON THE BOTTOM HERE LIKE THIS 
AND TWO WINDOWS TO SEE OUT OF 
WHAT SHAPE IS THIS 
THAT'S RIGHT IT'S A SQUARE WINDOW 
WE'VE GOT A SQUARE WINDOW HERE 
WE'VE ALSO GOT ROUND AND ARCHED WINDOWS 
BUT I'LL ONLY DRAW SQUARE WINDOWS 
I'M GONNA DRAW TWO SQUARE WINDOWS LIKE THAT 
GREAT 
NOW IF YOU MAKE A MONEY BOX 
MAYBE YOU CAN DRAW ROUND OR ARCHED WINDOWS 
OR ANYTHING ELSE AROUND YOUR HOUSE 
NOW IT'S TIME FOR ME TO MAKE A ROOF FOR THE HOUSE 
AND THIS IS PERFECT 
IT'S ORANGE CARD AND I'M FOLDING IT IN HALF LIKE THIS 
CAN YOU SEE I'M USING MY HAND TO PRESS IT DOWN 
SO WE'VE GOT A NICE CREASE OR A FOLD THEN I'LL UNFOLD IT 
AND WE CAN SEE THAT CREASE IN THE MIDDLE 
THEN I'M GONNA TAKE THIS TUBE 
AND I'M GONNA HAVE TO DRAW AROUND MY TUBE 
I'LL SHOW YOU WHY IN JUST A MOMENT 
BUT LET'S JUST USE THIS PEN TO DRAW AROUND THE BOTTOM 
AND WHAT SHAPE AM I DRAWING HERE 
IT'S A CIRCLE IT'S A ROUND SHAPE 
AND LET'S DO ANOTHER ONE JUST HERE 
SO I'VE GOT TWO CIRCLES 
WHICH I'M GONNA CUT OUT IN A MOMENT 
USING MY SCISSORS THERE WE ARE 
YOU MIGHT WANT TO ASK SOMEONE TO HELP YOU TO CUT OUT YOUR CIRCLES 
BECAUSE SOMETIMES CARD'S A BIT TRICKY 
I'M FOLDING IT BACK UP 
AND THEN I'LL CUT RIGHT AROUND THESE BLUE CIRCLES I'VE JUST DRAWN 
ALL THE WAY ROUND THIS CARD IS QUITE STIFF 
THERE WE ARE 
ALL THE WAY ROUND 
AND AGAIN THIS CIRCLE HERE ALL THE WAY ROUND 
ALL THE WAY ROUND ALMOST DONE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE 
AH THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE CIRCLES NOW DO THEY 
BUT IF I OPEN IT UP YOU WILL SEE THAT I HAVE GOT TWO CIRCLES 
YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHY MY ROOF HAS TWO CIRCLES IN IT 
WELL LET ME SHOW YOU 
I'LL FOLD UP A BIT OF STICKY TAPE AND PUT IT ON HERE LIKE THIS 
THEN I'M GONNA DO THE SAME AGAIN 
FOLDING IT UP SO THE WHOLE PIECE IS STICKY ALL OVER WHICH IS GREAT 
AND THEN I'M GONNA POP IT ON TOP OF MY HOUSE LIKE THIS 
ON TOP LIKE THIS PRESSING IT DOWN NICE AND FIRMLY 
AND ON TOP LIKE THAT 
THERE WE GO HA HA HA HA 
WE HAVE OUR HOUSE WITH TWO HOLES IN THE TOP 
I WONDER WHY 
WELL THIS IS SILVER FOIL 
AND I'M GONNA ROLL THIS TUBE UP IN THE SILVER FOIL LIKE THAT 
I'M TUCKING THE ENDS IN AND THAT END 
SO I'VE NOW GOT A SILVER TUBE 
CAN YOU GUESS WHY 
I'VE GOT SOME BROWN TISSUE PAPER 
AND I'M GOING TO ROLL THIS TUBE UP IN THE BROWN TISSUE PAPER 
TUCKING THE ENDS IN LIKE THAT 
I'M TUCKING THE OTHER END IN LIKE THAT 
I SHOULD USE A PIECE OF STICKY TAPE TO KEEP THE TISSUE PAPER TOGETHER 
COS TISSUE PAPER DOESN'T STAY AS WELL AS SILVER FOIL 
CAN YOU GUESS WHY I'VE GOT TWO TUBES 
ONE FOR BROWN COINS AND ONE FOR SILVER COINS 
THESE ARE CHIMNEYS FOR MY HOUSE 
I'M GOING TO PUT MY BROWN TUBE IN ONE HOLE THERE LIKE THAT 
AND I'M GONNA PUT THE SILVER ONE IN HERE LIKE THIS YAAY 
THERE WE ARE 
SO I'VE GOT MY LITTLE MONEY BOX HOUSE 
ISN'T THAT GREAT 
HELLO PAUL OH HI TAMBA JUST IN TIME 
I HAVE GOT A PRESENT FOR YOU 
THANK YOU WHAT IS IT
