GROWING SIGNS OF ECONOMIC TROUBLE AHEAD 
MANY MORTGAGE HOLDERS WILL 
BENEFIT IMMEDIATELY AS THE 
BASE 
RATE FALLS TO FIVE PER CENT BUT IS 
LATE TO PREVENT A 
DRASTIC FALL IN 
PROPERTY PRICES WE WILL BE ASSESSING 
THE LIKELY IMPACT OF 
THE 
LATEST CUT IN BASE RATES 
ALSO TONIGHT 
BLAIR'S ABJECT 
SAUDIS THE HIGH COURT SLAMS 
DECISION TO DROP 
AN INVESTIGATION 
INTO ALLEGED CORRUPTION 
SUGGESTIONS THAT MADELEINE 
LEFT CRYING THE 
NIGHT BEFORE SHE 
LEFT CRYING THE NIGHT BEFORE SHE WAS ABDUCTED 
THIS WAS A SMEAR 
ATTEMPT DESIGNED TO UNDERMINE KATE 
END GERRY'S GOOD WORK THAT THEY 
HAVE BEEN DOING IN EUROPE 
TO ALL 
THE NON BELIEVERS THE NON MUSLIMS 
LET IT BE KNOWN THAT YOU CAN NEVER 
WIN IN THIS WAR NEVER CAN YOU WIN 
IN THIS WAR 
AND THE SO CALLED MARTYRDOM VIDEO 
OF ONE OF THE MEN ACCUSED OF 
PLOTTING TERROR ATTACKS 
IN B. B. C. LONDON NEWS 
ON TRIAL FOR HELPING TO PLAN THE 
JULY SEVENTH BOMBINGS ON THE CAPITAL 
AND ANGER AT MOVES TO RETURN HORSES 
TO OWNERS ACCUSED OF CRUELTY 
GOOD EVENING 
FACED WITH GROWING EVIDENCE OF A 
SERIOUS ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND A 
SHARP FALL IN HOUSE PRICES THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND HAS CUT INTEREST 
RATES AGAIN THE QUARTER POINT 
REDUCTION IN THE COST OF BORROWING 
BRINGS RATE TO FIVE PER CENT SOME OF THE BIG 
LENDERS HAVE SAID THEY WILL PASS ON 
THE BENEFIT TO CUSTOMERS WHERE 
POSSIBLE OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR 
STEPHANIE FLANDERS REPORTS ON THE 
LIKELY IMPACT OF THIS LATEST MOVE 
IT SEEMED LIKE THE LEAST THE BANK 
OF ENGLAND COULD DO AFTER ALL OF 
THE GLOOM COMING OUT OF THE HOUSING 
MARKET IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS A 
THIRD RATE CUT IN JUST FIVE MONTHS 
THE BANK HAS LOOKED AT THE ECONOMY 
AND DECIDED WE NEED MORE HELP TO 
MAKE SURE THE SLOWDOWN DOES NOT 
TURN INTO ANYTHING WORSE BUT IT 
DOES NOT THINK IT IS TIME TO PANIC 
AND IT DOES STILL THINK INFLATION 
IS A WORRY WHICH IS WHY IT HAS ANY 
CUT RATES BY OH TWO FIVE PER CENT WE HAVE BEEN 
TRACKING WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE 
RATES TODAY 
WE ARE RINGING ROUND 
TO SEE WHETHER YOU WILL BE PASSING 
ON THE RATE CUT 
A LOT OF LENDERS 
STILL HAVE NOT DECIDED BUT THE BIG 
PICTURE IS FAIRLY CLEAR THERE WILL 
BE WINNERS AND LOSERS FROM THIS CUT 
MOST OF THE BIG LENDERS SAY THEIR 
STANDARD VARIABLE RATE MORTGAGES 
ARE GOING DOWN TRACKER RATES WILL 
FALL AS WELL ALTOGETHER THAT IS 
HALF OF ALL MORTGAGES THE OTHER 
HALF ON FIXED RATES WILL NOT SEE 
A CHANGE BUT THE RATES ON NEW 
MORTGAGES ARE GOING DOWN 
NATIONWIDE AND ALLIANCE AND AMP LEICESTER 
ANNOUNCED THEY ARE PUTTING THEIR 
RATES UP 
THE CRUNCH ON NEW BORROWING DOES 
NOT ONLY HIT PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A 
NEW MORTGAGE LENDING RATES FOR 
BUSINESS ARE ALSO GOING UP PUT IN 
PROJECTS LIKE THIS SHOPPING 
DEVELOPMENT IN CHESTER ON HOLD THE THE CREDIT CRUNCH IS THE SINGLE MOST 
IMPORTANT PROBLEM THAT WE ARE 
EXPERIENCING DEVELOPERS CANNOT 
BORROW MONEY EASILY THEY NEED TO 
BE HEAVILY SECURED THE BANKS ARE 
KEEN NOT TO LEND 
LENDERS ARE NOT 
PASSING ON RATE CUTS BECAUSE THEY 
ARE PAYING MORE FOR MONEY THEY 
BORROWED FROM OTHER BANKS IN 
NORMAL TIMES LIKE LAST JUNE THE 
GAP BETWEEN THE INTERBANK AND THE 
BASE RATE WAS ONLY ABOUT OH TWO FIVE PER CENT AT 
THE PEAK OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH THAT 
ROSE TO JUST OVER ONE PER CENT TODAY IT WAS 
STILL OH SEVEN FIVE PER CENT HIGHER THAN THE BASE 
RATE THE BANK SAY THAT RATE CUTS 
ON THEIR OWN ARE NOT ENOUGH TO GET 
THEM TO LEND MORE FREELY THEY ALSO 
NEED HELP GETTING DODGY LOANS OF 
THEIR BOOKS THE AMERICAN CENTRAL 
BANK HAS GONE A LOT OF THAT THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND NOT SO MUCH IF 
LENDING RATES STAY HIGH AFTER 
TODAY'S CUT THERE WILL BE 
PRESSURED TO DO MORE 
THE BANK 
SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT WAYS OF 
PUMPING LIQUIDITY INTO THE BANKING 
SYSTEM WHICH MEANS LENDING MONEY 
TO THE BANKS ON LONGER TERMS THAN 
NORMAL AND LENDING IT AGAINST A 
RANGE OF SECURITIES COLLATERAL 
THAT IS BROADER THAN NORMAL IT 
NEEDS TO GIVE THAT BOOST INTO THE 
SYSTEM TO MAKE THINGS WORK BETTER 
THIS IS UNLIKELY TO BE THE LAST 
RATE CUT FROM THE BANK BUT FOR THE 
MOMENT THE FOCUS IS ON HOW IT WILL 
HELP MONEY FLOW MORE FREELY AMONG 
THE BANKS ONCE AGAIN IN THIS 
CREDIT CRUNCH WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR 
MORTGAGES IN THE BROADER ECONOMY 
DEPENDS ON WHAT HAPPENS DEEP IN THE 
CITY CITY STEPHANIE IS WITH ME NOW IT IS 
ANOTHER SMALL CUT SO WHY WOULD IT 
MAKE BIG IMPACT 
IT SEEMS TINY 
AFTER ALL OF THE DARK HEADLINES OF 
THE LAST FEW DAYS PEOPLE LOOK AT 
AMERICA AND SAY WHY CAN WE NOT 
HAVE SIX BIG INTEREST RATE CUTS 
LIKE THEY HAVE THAT RATHER THAN 
THREE LITTLE ONES THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND WOULD SAY WE HAVE A 
SLOWDOWN BUT WE ARE NOT IN 
RECESSION THE WAY THAT THE U. S. IS 
WE MAY BE LOOKING AT A SHARP FALL 
IN THE HOUSING MARKET BUT THERE IS 
NO EVIDENCE OF IT SPREADING TO THE 
REST OF THE ECONOMY IN A DANGEROUS 
WAY IF THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT 
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE CUT RATES 
MORE INSTEAD WE HAVE GOT A BIT OF 
HELP BUT THEY ARE STILL WORRIED 
ABOUT INFLATION THE FOCUS GOING 
FORWARD WILL BE NOT SO MUCH OF RATE 
CUTS BUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO 
TO BOOST LIQUIDITY IN THE SYSTEM SO 
THAT THE RATE CUTS GET PASSED ON 
TONY BLAIR'S GOVERNMENT AND THE 
SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE HAVE BEEN 
SEVERELY CRITICISED BY HIGH COURT 
JUDGES FREE DECISION TO DROP AN 
INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGED BRIBERY 
THE CASE INVOLVED FORTY BILLION 
ARMS DEAL BETWEEN B. A. E. SYSTEMS AND 
SAUDI ARABIA THE JUDGES SAID MR. 
BLAIR'S GOVERNMENT AND THE F. S. O. 
THE S. F. O. GAVE HIM TOO EASILY TO 
SAUDI THREATS AND THE DECISION 
AMOUNTED TO ABJECT SURRENDER 
THEY GAVE IN TO RECENTLY 
THIS STORY IS ABOUT THE 
GOVERNMENT'S COMMITMENT TO THE RULE 
OF LAW AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE 
DESIRE TO SAFEGUARD JOBS AND 
PRESERVE NATIONAL SECURITY 
EFFECTIVELY SQUEEZED OUT JUSTICE 
BUT TODAY THE HIGH COURT JUDGE HAS 
SLAMMED THE GOVERNMENT FOR WHAT 
THEY CALLED ITS ABJECT SURRENDER TO 
BLATANT THREATS FROM SAUDI ARABIA 
THEY SAID 
THE ORIGINAL ARMS DEAL SIGNED IN 
NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE BY THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT 
CEMENTED BRITAIN'S BIGGEST EVER 
EXPORT CONTRACT KNOWN AS AL 
YAMAMAH THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT WENT 
ON TO BUY TORNADO JETS HAWK 
TRAINERS EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING 
PACKAGES ALL WORTH OVER FORTY BILLION 
THOUSANDS OF BRITONS WENT TO WORK 
IN SAUDI ARABIA BUT CRITICS SAY 
THE DEAL RESTED ON BRIBES AND THE 
SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE BEGAN PROBE 
FOUR YEARS AGO B. A. E. SYSTEMS WHICH 
BUILT THE JETS SAY THE DEAL WAS 
CLEAN THE PROBE BY THE END BY 
THE S. F. O. WAS LOOKING INTO 
ALLEGATIONS THAT SAUDI ARABIA'S 
PRINCE BANDAR RECEIVED MILLIONS OF 
POUNDS IN KICKBACKS COMMON 
PRACTICE IN THE MIDDLE EAST HE 
DENIES IT THE S. F. O. WAS STARTING TO 
LOOK AT PRICE SWISS BANK ACCOUNTS 
INFURIATING THE SAUDIS IN TWO THOUSAND SIX 
THE THEN PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR 
ORDERED AN ABRUPT HALT TO THE PROBE 
QUOTING A THREAT TO BRITAIN'S 
NATIONAL SECURITY THE THREAT 
ALLEGEDLY DELIVERED TO DOWNING 
STREET IN PERSON BY PRINCE BANDAR 
WAS THIS STOP THE PROBE OR THERE 
WILL BE NO MORE ARMS DEALS AND 
SAUDI ARABIA WILL STOP SHARING 
INTELLIGENCE ON TERRORISM POSSIBLY 
EVEN LEADING TO ANOTHER SEVEN SEVENTHS BOMBING 
NO ONE KNEW WHETHER THE SAUDIS 
REALLY WOULD HAVE WITHDRAWN THEIR 
HELP ON COUNTER TERRORISM IF THE 
S. F. O. PROBE HAD GONE AHEAD HAVE 
BEEN TOLD THAT SAUDI COUNTER 
TERRORISM OFFICERS WERE DESPERATE 
TO KEEP THE RELATIONSHIP WITH 
BRITAIN PROTECTED FROM ANY 
POLITICAL INTERFERENCE FROM THEIR 
MASTERS BUT SENIOR SAUDI PRINCES 
FELT SO STRONGLY ABOUT THE ISSUE 
THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT DID NOT 
DARE TAKE CHANCE THE FALL OUT 
FROM TODAY'S RULING IS BOTH 
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL 
THE SERIOUS 
FRAUD OFFICE INVESTIGATION INTO THE 
ARMS DEAL NEEDS TO BE REOPENED 
IMMEDIATELY AND THERE NEEDS TO BE 
AN INDEPENDENT INQUIRY INTO THE 
UNDUE POLITICAL PRESSURE WHICH 
APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN APPLIED BY 
THIS GOVERNMENT ON THE SERIOUS 
FRAUD OFFICE IN THE FIRST PLACE 
THERE IS A LOT AT STAKE HERE SAUDI 
ARABIA IS BRITAIN'S BIGGEST TRADE 
PARTNER IN THE MIDDLE EAST SAUDI 
HELP IN COUNTER TERRORISM IS 
HELPFUL THOUGH PERHAPS NOT CRUCIAL 
NEITHER IS AN EXCUSE SAYS THE HIGH

GERRY AND KATE MCCANN HAVE 
RESPONDED ANGRILY TO THE 
PUBLICATION OF LEAKED TRANSCRIPTS 
OF INTERVIEWS THEY HAD WITH 
PORTUGUESE POLICE LAST YEAR THE 
TRANSCRIPTS SUGGEST THAT ON THE 
MORNING SHE DISAPPEARED THEIR 
DAUGHTER MADELEINE HAD ASKED HER 
MOTHER WHY SHE HAD NOT COME WHEN 
THE CHILDREN WERE CRYING THE NIGHT 
BEFORE THE MCCANNS WERE IN 
BRUSSELS TODAY PROMOTING A NEW 
MONITORING SYSTEM FOR MISSING 
CHILDREN AS RICHARD BILTON REPORTS 
BACK HOME TONIGHT AND VERY ANGRY 
THE MCCANNS BELIEVE SOMEONE IN THE 
PORTUGUESE POLICE IS TRYING TO 
UNDERMINE THEM THEY SAY THAT THESE 
STORIES ON A SPANISH WEBSITE AND 
T. V. STATION ARE BASED ON LEAKED 
TRANSCRIPTS OF POLICE INTERVIEWS 
DETAILS KNOWN ONLY TO THE FAMILY 
AND TO PORTUGUESE DETECTIVES YOU YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHY 
DOCUMENTATION THAT WAS IN THE 
POLICE FILES COVERED BY PORTUGUESE 
JUDICIAL SECRECY IS NOW IN THE 
PUBLIC DOMAIN IT IS NOT ONLY 
ILLEGAL IT IS OUTRAGEOUS THIS WAS 
A BLATANT SMEAR ATTEMPT DESIGNED TO 
UNDERMINE THE KATE AND GERRY'S GOOD 
WORK THAT THEY HAVE BEEN CONDUCTING 
IN EUROPE 
MADELEINE MCCANN HAS NOT 
BEEN SEEN SINCE THE NIGHT OF MAY 
THIRD THE RELEASED INTERVIEWS RELATE 
TO SOMETHING HER MOTHER KATE 
MCCANN SAYS THAT MADELEINE SAID ON 
THE MORNING OF THE DAY SHE 
DISAPPEARED OVER BREAKFAST THEY 
SAY MADELEINE THE CANCER TO HER 
PARENTS WHY DIDN'T YOU COME WHEN 
ME AND SEAN WERE CRYING LAST NIGHT 
SHE WAS REFERRING TO HER BROTHER 
KATE AND GERRY MCCANN SAY THAT THE 
PREVIOUS NIGHT THEY HAD BEEN EATING 
AT THE HOTEL BAR AND ALTHOUGH THEY 
CHECKED EVERY TWENTY MINUTES THEY HAD 
NOT HEARD ANYBODY CRYING THEY SAY 
THEY TOLD POLICE ABOUT MADELEINE'S 
COMMENTS BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT 
MIGHT SHOW THAT SOMEONE HAD 
ATTEMPTED TO ABDUCT MADELEINE A 
NIGHT EARLIER NOW THEY SAY IT IS 
BEING USED AGAINST THEM THE 
DOCUMENTS CERTAINLY EMERGED ON AN 
IMPORTANT DAY FOR THE MCCANNS THEY 
WERE IN BRUSSELS TO ENCOURAGE MEPS 
TO SUPPORT AN AMERICAN STYLE FAST 
ALERT SYSTEM FOR WHEN CHILDREN GO 
MISSING 
IT IS EASY TO RECALL JUST MISSING HOW EXCRUCIATINGLY AWFUL THAT 
FEELING OF HELPLESSNESS WAS WE 
WERE DESPERATE WE WANTED 
EVERYTHING DONE FOR OUR LITTLE GIRL 
AS ANY PARENT WOULD 
THE MCCANNS 
CAME HERE STILL AS NAMED SUSPECTS 
IN THEIR DAUGHTER'S DISAPPEARANCE 
I ASKED THEM ABOUT THAT STATUS WE WE HAVE NOT BEEN ACCUSED OF ANYTHING 
YOU KNOW IF ANYONE IS QUALIFIED TO 
TALK ABOUT CHILD ABDUCTION AND THE 
EFFECT OF IT IT IS US 
WE ARE 
PRETTY OPTIMISTIC THAT THAT 
ARGUIDOS STATUS WILL BE LIFTED SOON 
EVERYONE SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT THE 
FOCUS SHOULD BE ON TRYING TO FIND 
MADELEINE 
THE MCCANNS HAD SPENT MADELEINE ALL DAY TRYING TO GET SUPPORT FOR A 
SYSTEM THEY THINK WOULD HAVE MADE A 
DIS A DIFFERENCE ON THE NIGHT 
MADELEINE DISAPPEARED THEY SPENT 
THE EVENING RELIVING THE INTERVIEWS 
THEY GAVE HIM THE FOLLOWING DAYS 
ALL NEARLY A YEAR AGO STILL SO 
MUCH COMMENT AND CAMPAIGNING BUT 
NO NEWS ON A MISSING LITTLE GIRL 
COMING UP 
THREE MEMBERS OF SHANNON MATTHEWS' 
EXTENDED FAMILY ARE RELEASED ON 
BAIL BAIL AND THE SEX ABUSE SCANDAL AT A 
RELIGIOUS SECT IN TEXAS FOUR HUNDRED 
CHILDREN HAVE BEEN REMOVED BY THE 
AUTHORITIES AUTHORITIES THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE 
SAYS THAT THE OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY 
WILL CONTINUE DESPITE THE SEVERE 
DISRUPTION CAUSED BY HUMAN RIGHTS 
STRIP HUMAN RIGHTS PROTESTERS IN 
BRITAIN FRANCE AND AMERICA BUT 
THE I. O. C. CHAIRMAN HAS CALLED ON 
CHINESE AUTHORITIES TO HONOUR THEIR 
PROMISE THAT THEY MADE WHEN THEY 
WERE ROARED AWARDED THE GAMES TO 
IMPROVE THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD 
WITH ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN DAYS BEFORE THE GAMES OPEN 
MIHIR BOSE REPORTS FROM BEIJING 
ANOTHER DAY ANOTHER CITY ANOTHER 
PROTEST THE DISASTER THE 
DISASTROUS TORCH RELAY ROLLS ON TO 
BUENOS AIRES TOMORROW THE I. O. C. SAID 
TODAY THAT IT WILL NOT BE CANCELLED 
BUT THE PROTESTERS CAN CLAIM A 
VICTORY HAVING FORCED CHINA'S 
HUMAN RIGHTS ON TO THE OLYMPIC 
AGENDA 
AWARDING THE GAMES TO CHINA AGENDA WOULD ADVANCE THE SOCIAL AGENDA OF 
CHINA INCLUDING HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
WE DEFINITELY ASK CHINA TO RESPECT 
THIS 
THIS IS THE STRONGEST THIS STATEMENT ON HUMAN RIGHTS THAT 
PRESIDENT JACQUES ROGGE HAS EVER 
MADE IT IS PART OF AN EFFORT TO 
CONVINCE THE WORLD IT WAS RIGHT TO 
BRING THE GAMES TO CHINA AND THAT 
DECISION HAS ALREADY IMPROVED THE 
SITUATION HERE SOME SENIOR FIGURES 
IN THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT FEEL THAT 
THE STATEMENT 
DO S. 
NOT GO FAR 
THE STATEMENT DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH 
WHEN WE SPEAK ABOUT TIBET ENOUGH YES IT IS POLITICS BUT IT IS A 
PARTICULAR POLITICS IT IS A HUMAN 
RIGHT IT IS FREEDOM IT IS 
DIFFERENT AND WE ARE OBLIGED TO 
CONVINCE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO 
CO OPERATE 
BEIJING INCREASINGLY CO OPERATE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FOCUS ON ITS 
INTERNATIONAL IMAGE REACTED 
SWIFTLY REMINDING THE I. O. C. THAT 
POLITICS SHOULD BE KEPT AWAY FROM 
THE GAMES 
I BELIEVE I E. O. C. 
OFFICIALS SUPPORT THE BEIJING 
OLYMPICS AND ADHERENCE TO THE 
OLYMPIC CHARTER OF NOT BRINGING IN 
ANY IRRELEVANT POLITICAL FACTORS L. 
HOPE I'LL SEE OFFICIALS CONTINUED 
TO ADHERE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE 
OLYMPIC CHARTER I CHOSE C. 
JACQUES ROGGE ADMITS THE I. O. C. IS IN 
CRISIS BUT SAYS IT HAS SEEN WORSE 
THE GUERRILLAS ARE STILL IN ISRAELI 
HEADQUARTERS 
TERROR TACTICS ROCKED HEADQUARTERS THE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO MUNICH OLYMPICS THE 
SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN LED 
TO A BOYCOTT OF MOSCOW IN NINETEEN EIGHTY AND 
A RETALIATORY SOVIET BOYCOTT 
OVERSHADOWED THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR LOS ANGELES 
GAMES HE IS CONFIDENT THE MOVEMENT 
CAN BOUNCE BACK AGAIN IN TIME FOR 
THE GAMES OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
IN BEIJING AT THE MOMENT THIS 
SEEMS OPTIMISTIC AS THE HUMAN 
RIGHTS ISSUE DOES NOT LOOK LIKE 
GOING AWAY THE IMAGE CHINA SEEKS 
TO PROMOTE MAY NEVER BE REALISED 
IN NORTHERN IRELAND THE DEMOCRATIC 
UNIONIST PARTY WILL ELECT A NEW 
LEADER AT NEXT WEEK THE FINANCE
