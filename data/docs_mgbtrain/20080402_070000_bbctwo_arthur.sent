SHH 
YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE GET CARRIED AWAY WITH THINGS SOMETIMES 
LIKE WHEN D. W. PLAYED HIPPO HUNT FOR FOUR DAYS 
OR WHEN FRANCINE TRIED TO MAKE ONE HUNDRED BASKETS IN A ROW 
HERE GOES NUMBER SEVENTY THREE 
WAIT THAT ONE DIDN'T COUNT 
ROAR 
WOW ARTHUR DID YOU SEE THAT UH HUH AMAZING 
BUSTER'S VERY EXCITED BECAUSE OUR CLASS IS GOING ON A FIELD TRIP 
TO RAINBOW ROCK STATE PARK WHERE WE WILL HUNT FOR ANIMAL FOSSILS 
INCLUDING DINOSAURS YES 
EVERYONE FILE OUT IN AN ORDERLY FASHION 
TRICERATOPS GRR ROWL RRR 
T. REX GRRR 
WHEN I DISCOVER THIS NEW DINOSAUR WHAT SHOULD I CALL IT BUSTERSAURUS 
HEY WHERE DID WE PUT THE CHISELS 
GOT 'EM HOW ABOUT THE BRUSHES GOT 'EM WHAT ABOUT THE GOT 'EM 
AHEM CHILDREN IF YOU COULD ALL QUIET DOWN 
QUIET FOLLOW ME 
RANGER RUTH'S GOING TO TELL US ABOUT FOSSILS BEFORE WE EXPLORE OURSELVES 
HI KIDS 
T. REX T. REX T. REX 
DON'T YOU LOOK LIKE A SMART BUNCH OF BOYS AND GIRLS 
CAN ANY OF YOU TELL ME WHAT A FOSSIL IS 
YOU WITH THE EARS 
THE CALCIFIED REMAINS OF ANCIENT ORGANISMS 
MINERALS SEEP INTO THEIR TISSUE PRESERVING THEIR FORM 
COUNT ON ME TO PICK THE GENIUS 
FOR THE REST OF YOU BOYS AND GIRLS WE HAVE A LITTLE SHOW LIGHTS 
PSST BUSTER THAT WAS AWESOME 
ONE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS AGO RAINBOW ROCK STATE PARK LOOKED VERY DIFFERENT 
IT WAS MUCH HOTTER THERE WERE A LOT OF BIRDS AND DIFFERENT INSECTS 
AND EVEN DINOSAURS 
YEAH 
EVENTUALLY THE FERNS AND ANIMALS WOULD DIE 
QUIET 
THANK YOU 
USUALLY THE BODIES WOULD ROT AWAY 
BUT VERY RARELY THE HARD PARTS OF THE BODIES LIKE BONES WOULD LAST 
MANY YEARS LATER THIS WHOLE AREA WAS COVERED BY THE SEA 
OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS THE SOIL TURNED TO ROCK 
AND THE BONES TURNED TO ROCK TOO 
THEN THE SEA DRIED UP AND NOW ONE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS LATER THE RESULT 
GASPS 
SO WHO WANTS TO GO ON A FOSSIL HUNT YEAH 
MAN I CAN'T WAIT TO GET MY HANDS ON ONE OF THOSE FOSSILS 
I LIKE THE MODELS BETTER I LIKE TO SEE WHAT DINOSAURS LOOKED LIKE 
YEAH BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT A FOSSIL IT'S THE ACTUAL THING 
THE ACTUAL BONE OF SOMETHING THAT WAS ALIVE MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO 
LISTEN UP EVERYONE YOU SEE THE LAYERS IN THIS ROCK 
EACH LAYER IS FROM A DIFFERENT TIME 
THE BOTTOM ONES ARE FROM THE CRETACEOUS ERA WHICH WAS 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX MILLION YEARS AGO 
VERY GOOD THE TOP LAYERS ARE FROM ABOUT TWENTY MILLION YEARS LATER 
SO WE CAN TELL HOW OLD A FOSSIL IS BY ITS POSITION IN THE CLIFF 
HOW CAN WE GET FOSSILS FROM A CLIFF WITH THESE LITTLE BUCKETS 
YOU WON'T BE HUNTING IN THE CLIFFS THAT'S FOR REAL PALAEONTOLOGISTS 
YOU GET TO HUNT IN THE STREAM IN THE STREAM ALL RIGHT 
THE WATER'S GREAT HEY LOOK I FOUND A FOSSIL 
OH NO WAIT IT'S A ROCK HEY HERE'S ONE 
H. M. M. 
YOU BOYS ARE DILIGENT FOUND ANY FOSSILS 
NO 
SORRY WE'RE GOING TO BREAK FOR A SNACK NOW 
THEN IT'LL BE TIME FOR THE BUS SEE YOU ON SHORE 
LOOKS LIKE IT'S TIME TO HEAD IN I'M BUSHED 
I'M GOING TO KEEP WORKING TILL WE HAVE TO GO HUH 
THEY'VE GOT SODA THERE ARE FOSSILS HERE YOU CAN DRINK SODA ANY TIME 
COME ON WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO FIND IN TEN MINUTES 
THINK YOU'RE JUST GONNA PICK ONE UP 
BUSTER ARE YOU O. K. 
BUSTER QUIT IT YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS WHAT IS IT 
BUSTER OW HAVE YOU GONE NUTS I FOUND IT 
I FOUND IT IT'S HERE FOUND WHAT LET ME SEE 
I FOUND IT FIRST OH WOW IT'S A LEAF FOSSIL 
A LEAF FOSSIL A LEAF FOSSIL 
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A LEAF THAT THICK 
ARTHUR THIS IS 
A FOOTPRINT 
O. K. LET'S GO ROUND AND TALK ABOUT THE FOSSILS WE FOUND 
WE MANAGED TO FIND WHAT LOOKS LIKE A FOSSILISED SHELL 
WELL ALL RIGHT IT LOOKS LIKE A MARGINELLA 
WAIT YOU MEAN YOU DON'T GET TO KEEP THEM 
DIDN'T I EXPLAIN WE PUT THE FOSSILS IN THE MUSEUM 
SO OTHER KIDS CAN COME AND SEE THEM 
IF PEOPLE TOOK THEM ALL HOME THERE'D BE NONE LEFT WHO'S NEXT 
WE FOUND SOME NEAT ROCKS I CAN'T BELIEVE IT 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD DO THAT TO ME 
THAT'S O. K. I'M SURE YOU TRIED HARD NEXT 
EH WE DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING EITHER WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE 
WELL THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES SOMETIMES 
IT'S O. K. WE HAD FUN ANYWAY WE'LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH THIS 
BUSTER IT ISN'T OURS IT BELONGS IN THE MUSEUM 
WE FOUND IT DIDN'T WE WHAT IF THEY SEARCH US ON THE WAY OUT 
WHAT IF THEY HAVE A SPECIAL FOSSIL DETECTOR ALARM HEY GENIUS 
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU WEREN'T DISCOURAGED 
YOU HAVE THE MAKINGS OF A REAL PALAEONTOLOGIST 
SHE KNOWS 
DON'T BE SILLY 
BYE NOW GOODBYE SEE YA 
HAVE FUN GOODBYE 
BYE BYE NOW 
NO IT'S TOO DANGEROUS YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT A SECRET 
DID YOU FIND ANY NICE FOSSILS ON YOUR FIELD TRIP DEAR NO NOTHING 
WHEN CAN I COME AND SEE IT IT'S TOO DANGEROUS TO TAKE OUT 
WHAT IF MY MOM CAME IN WHAT'S THE POINT OF HAVING IT 
IF WE CAN'T LOOK AT IT OURSELVES 
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED OUR FIELD TRIP 
EVEN IF THE FOSSILS YOU FOUND WEREN'T AS EXCITING AS DINOSAUR'S 
THEY ARE VERY RARE IT WOULD'VE BEEN MIRACULOUS 
IF YOU HAD DISCOVERED ANY DINOSAUR BONES OR EVEN RARER 
DINOSAUR FOOTPRINTS 
WHO IS IT FOSSIL POLICE 
I'M SORRY BUSTER THEY MADE ME TELL THEY TICKLED ME 
WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE YOU'RE HIDING A DINOSAUR 
BUT THAT'S RIDICULOUS HOW COULD 
WHAT'S THAT NOISE 
ARTHUR DOWN HERE 
HERE YOU TAKE IT 
I DON'T WANT IT I'VE GOT TO GET RID OF IT IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY 
I THOUGHT IT'D BE GREAT HAVING THIS THING TO MYSELF 
BUT IT'S DRIVING ME NUTS I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT IT 
IT DOESN'T BELONG HERE WHERE DOES IT BELONG 
HELLO IS THIS RANGER RUTH 
DOCTOR MARSH THINKS IT'S THE FOOTPRINT OF A BABY DASPLETOSAURUS
