ON BUSES 
BUT WILL THEY TACKLE CRIME OR 
PEOPLE'S FEAR OF CRIME ALSO 
TONIGHT DWAIN CHAMBERS WILL 
LAUNCH AN APPEAL TO COMPETE IN THE 
OLYMPICS AND WE ARE IN THE NORTH 
LONDON BOROUGH THAT HAS ALREADY GOT 
THESE AND WANTS TO BRING IN THESE 
TO MAKE 
AND OOH AH JUST A LITTLE BIT 
EUROVISION ON THE WEST END STAGE 
GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO B. B. C. 
LONDON NEWS 
IT WAS ONE OF HIS KEY ELECTION 
PLEDGES TO MAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
SAFER SO THIS MORNING MAYOR BORIS 
JOHNSON UNVEILED THE NEW POLICE 
TEAMS WHICH WILL BE DEPLOYED ACROSS 
LONDON'S BUS NETWORK BUT CRIME ON 
BUSES IS ALREADY FALLING SO IS THE 
MONEY BEING WELL SPENT OUR 
TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT TOM EDWARDS 
IS AT VAUXHALL CROSS BUS STATION 
NOW TOM DOES THIS MEAN EXTRA 
OFFICERS ARE BEING EMPLOYED YES YES WE'RE GOING TO GET FOUR HUNDRED FORTY NEW OFFICERS 
IN EACH TEAM THERE WILL BE TWO 
POLICE AND SEVEN COMMUNITY SUPPORT 
OFFICERS TOTAL COST ELEVEN POINT THREE MILLION 
ARSON ON A BUS IN HARINGEY THIS 
OFFENDER GOT EIGHTEEN MONTHS BUT CRIME 
AND ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR ARE 
CONCERN TO PASSENGERS 
I CAN SEE 
YOUNGSTERS MAKING A LOT OF NOISE ON 
THE BUSES THEY KICK THE SEATS AND 
PUT THEIR FEET UP IF YOU TELL THEM 
THEY'RE VERY RUDE 
I'VE JUST GOT 
OFF A BUS AND SOMEONE WAS CAUSING 
PROBLEMS ALL BECAUSE THE DRIVER 
WOULDN'T LET HIM OUT IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE TRAFFIC BANG AND CRASHING 
IT IS RIDICULOUS 
THE MAYOR'S 
SOLUTION IS BUS HUB TEAMS A TRIAL 
SITE WILL BE AT WEST CROYDON WHERE 
THEY HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH GANGS 
FIGHTING 
IT IS VERY VERY FIGHTING IMPORTANT THAT YOU DRIVER OUT SO 
CALLED MINOR CRIME AND DISORDER 
YOU STOP KIDS ACTING UP ON BUSES AS 
A WAY OF DRIVING OUT MORE SERIOUS 
CRIME 
YOU SHOULD TRY IT FIRST ALL CRIME ALL RIGHT THIN 
IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE 
THOSE WHO LIVE HERE LIKE MAUREEN 
REYNOLDS WERE MAKING THEIR VOICES 
HEARD ARE YOU CONVINCED THIS WILL 
MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
I WILL WAIT AND 
SEE I WILL SEE WHAT HE IS GOING TO 
DO AND SEE IF IT WORKS AT BIG JOB 
AHEAD BUT I WOULD LIKE IT TO WORK 
THE MET'S FIGURES SHOW THAT CRIME 
ON BUSES IS COMING DOWN BUT TRAVEL 
WATCHDOGS AND PASSENGERS SAY THERE 
IS STILL A PROBLEM WITH LOW LEVEL 
ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR MANY PEOPLE 
BLAME FREE FRAFUL FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 
EACH TEAM WILL HAVE TWO POLICE AND 
SEVEN COMMUNITY POOR OFFICERS WE WE THINK WE CAN PUT MORE BODIES IN 
UNIFORM BY USING PCSOS THAN WE CAN 
BY COPS WHAT WE ARE DOING AND THE 
MAYOR ORIGINALLY SUGGESTED FOUR HUNDRED FORTY 
PCSOS THERE AREN'T THERE ARE 
GOING TO BE ONE HUNDRED POLICE AND THREE HUNDRED FORTY 
PCSOS 
YOU WILL SEE FEWER POSTERS PCSOS THE ELEVEN MILLION WILL COME FROM 
TRANSPORT FOR LONDON'S MARKETING 
BUDGET 
THE MONEY'S COMING FROM BUDGET REDUCING PUBLICITY EXPENDITURE FOR 
THINGS THAT THE NEW MAYOR DOESN'T 
WANT TO DO WHICH THE OLD ONE DID 
I'M COMFORTABLE TO GIVE ANOTHER NINE 
MILLION TO THE MET ON TOP OF THE 
SEVENTY MILLION WE PAY ANNUALLY MUCH MUCH RESTS ON CONVINCING PEOPLE LIKE 
MAUREEN THAT IT WILL MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE DIFFERENCE THIS IS A TRIAL AT THE MOMENT IT 
GOES ON FOR THREE MONTHS OR SO BUT 
I THINK IN THE FUTURE IT IS VERY 
LIKELY THAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE 
POLICE TEAMS IN TRANSPORT 
INTERCHANGES INTERCHANGES THERE'S LOTS MORE TO COME 
INCLUDING TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
THAT IS THE QUESTION WE HAVE 
ADVICE FOR PEOPLE IN A CREDIT 
CRUNCH QUANDARY 
THE BODY OF A WOMAN IN HER EIGHTIES HAS 
BEEN FOUND AT HER HOME IN SURREY 
DETECTIVES IN EPSOM SAY SHE DIED 
FROM INJURIES CAUSED BY A SHARP 
OBJECT BUT SO FAR NO WEAPON HAS 
BEEN FOUND MARC ASHDOWN HAS THE 
DETAILS IT WAS A HORRIBLE 
DISCOVERY AL FRIEND FOUND THE BODY 
IN THIS QUIET CORNER OF EPSOM 
BELIEVED TO BE A WOMAN IN HER EIGHTIES 
POLICE THINK SHE WAS STABBED AND 
SPENT THE DAY PAINSTAKINGLY 
SEARCHING THE AREA LOOKING FOR A 
WEAPON OR ANY CLUE AS TO WHAT 
HAPPENED I'VE BEEN TOLD BY LOCALS 
JOYCE WAS MORE OR LESS HOUSEBOUND 
SO A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE COMMUNITY 
VISITED HER DAILY AND HER DEATH HAS 
CAUSED A HUGE AMOUNT OF SHOCK AND 
UPSET 
WE HAVE KNOWN HER FOR TWENTY UPSET YEARS AND FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS 
SHE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET OUT 
MUCH SHE WOULD RING IN EVERY 
SATURDAY LIKE CLOCKWORK GIVE US A 
LIST OF SHOPPING AND BY TEN TO ELEVEN 
O'CLOCK WE USED TO DROP IT OFF HOW HOW DID YOU FEEL HEARING THIS SHOCKED SHOCKED THE AREA IS BETWEEN EPSOM AND EWELL 
LOCALS SAY IT SHOWS HOW BADLY 
REGENERATION IS NEED 
ITS TO HAVE 
CHANGED IT WAS GETTING BETTER 
IT'S HAD ITS THINGS OVER THE YEARS 
THEN IT GOT BETTER AND THIS HAPPENS 
IT MAKES YOU WONDER I'VE LIVED IN 
THE WORST PARTS OF LONDON AND EVEN 
THIS HAS REALLY SHOCKED ME IT'S IT'S AMAZING EPSOM WAS SAFE BEFORE BUT 
NOW I DON'T THINK EPSOM IS SAFE ANY 
MORE 
EVERY CLUE IS BEING MORE INVESTIGATED THIS VAN HAS BEEN 
CORDONED OFF ALL DAY BUT THE 
COMMUNITY ARE APPEALING TO ANYBODY 
IN THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY AND 
KWHREED MIGHT HAVE SEEN ANYTHING 
OUT OF THE ORDINARY TO CALL THEM 
THE DISGRACED SPRINTER DWAIN 
CHAMBERS HAS ANNOUNCED HE'S TO 
CHALLENGE A LIFETIME BAN ON 
COMPETING IN THE BRITISH OLYMPIC 
SQUAD AT THE SAME TIME HE'S BEEN 
COMING CLEAN ABOUT THE SCALE OF HIS 
DRUG TAKING BEFORE HE WAS BANNED 
FOR TWO YEARS EMMA NORTH HAS BEEN 
FOLLOWING THE STORY EMMA THIS IS 
A MAN WHO WON'T GIVE UP ABSOLUTELY 
DWAIN CHAMBERS IS A SPRINTING HERO 
FORMER ONE HUNDRED M. FORMER EUROPEAN 
CHAMPION BUT THROWN OUT OF THE 
SPORT FOR TWO YEARS FOR TAKING 
BANNED ANABOLIC STEROIDS THIS 
MORNING HE WAS WELCOMED WITH OPEN 
ARMS INTO THE OFFICES OF U. K. SPORT 
HE TOOK A LETTER WHICH OUTLINED 
PRETTY MUCH EVERY COUGH AND SPIT OF 
HIS TIME THE TRICKS OF THE TRADE 
ABOUT HOW TO WRIGGLE OUT OF THE 
TESTS HE'S DOING HIS BEST TO SHOW 
HE IS A REFORMED CHARACTER YES YES SHE WAS TRYING TO CONSOLIDATE HIS 
POSITION AS POACHER TURNED GAME 
GEAR IN THE ANTI DRUGS FIGHT HE IS 
TRYING TO OVERTURN HIS LIFE BAN 
FROM COMPETING IN THE U. K. TEAM THE 
OLYMPIC ASSOCIATION HAS A STRICT 
POLICY IF YOU ARE CAUGHT TAKING 
DRUGS YOU ARE OUT OF THE OLYMPIC 
TEAM FOR LIFE THE TEAM SAYS THEY 
HAVE HAD NO FORMAL CONTACT FROM 
DWAIN CHAMBERS ABOUT HIS FLANS BUT 
WILL FIGHT ANY CHALLENGE HE THINKS 
THERE ARE ONLY THREE COUNTRIES IN 
THE ENTIRE WORLD WHO HAVE THIS VERY 
STRICT BAN ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES 
SAID ONCE YOU'VE SERVED YOUR TIME 
PRETTY MUCH YOU CAN GO BACK INTO 
DID SQUAD BUT DWAIN CHAMBERS'S 
FIGHT IS BACKED UP BY THE MAN WHO 
SUPPLIED HIM WITH THE DRUGS IN THE 
FIRST PLACE 
I THINK IT IS VERY 
WRONG WHAT THE BOA IS DOING TO HIM 
SAYING AT LIFE BAN AND THE THEY 
ARE AN ISLAND TO THEMSELVES THEY 
ARE THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD 
THAT WANTS TO BAN PEOPLE FOR LIFE 
THAT'S MY OPINION THAT'S THE WRONG 
MESSAGE TO SEND TO HER CHILDREN 
YOU CAN'T HAVE COMPASSION AND THERE 
CAN BE NO FORGIVENESS IF SOMEBODY 
LEAVES LEADS AND DEMONSTRATES 
THAT IT CAN BE CLEAN LIKE DWAIN 
RECENTLY OTHERS WILL BELIEVE THEY 
CAN DO IT CLEAN TOO 
ALTHOUGH HE'S 
BEEN BANNED FROM COMPETING IN THE 
OLYMPICS HE IS ALLOWED TO COMPETE 
ELSEWHERE 
AFTER HE FINISHED HIS ELSEWHERE TWO YEAR BAN HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO 
INTO OTHER AREAS OF AT LETTICS 
THIS IS THE EUROPEAN INDOOR 
CHAMPIONSHIPS DOING IT CLEAN AND 
DOING IT BEST RUNG VERY FAST IN A 
STRAIGHT LINE HE GOT A SILVER 
MEDAL THIS IS A MAN WHO WANTS TO 
COME BACK VERY BADLY INDEED 
WITNESSES WHO SAW POLISH CARE 
ASSISTANT SHOT DEAD IN THE FOREHEAD 
IN SOUTH EAST LONDON HAVE BEEN 
DESCRIBING WHAT HAPPENED IN COURT 
TODAY MAGDA PNIEWSKA WHO WAS TWENTY SIX 
WAS CAUGHT IN CROSSFIRE AS SHE 
WALKED ACROSS A CAR PARK IN NEW 
CROSS LAST OCTOBER TWO YOUNG MEN 
WHO CANNOT BE NAMED DENY THE MURDER 
TODAY ONE REJECTED THE 
PROSECUTION'S CLAIM THAT HE WAS 
INVOLVED IN WILD WEST STYLE 
SHOOTOUT THE WAY WORKS OF ART ARE 
HANDLED AT THE NATIONAL GALLERY IS 
SUNDAY REVIEW AFTER THIS PAINTING 
WAS DAMAGED AFTER BEING MOVED FROM 
AN EXHIBITION THE WORK IS AROUND 
FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD AND COULD BE WORTH 
OVER ONE MILLION THE GALLERY HAS 
SAID ALTHOUGH THEY'VE MANAGE TO DO 
FIX THE PAINTING THEY VIEW THE 
DAMAGE TO WORKS OF ART AS EXTREMELY 
SERIOUS SERIOUS COULD A NEW GENERATION OF SPEED 
CAMERAS HELP REDUCE THE NUMBER OF 
DEATHS ON OUR ROADS CAMDEN IS 
HOPING TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY TO 
MEASURE A MOTORIST'S AVERAGE SPEED 
KARL MERCER HAS BEEN TAKING A 
CLOSER LOOK AND HE'S IN CAMDEN FOR 
US NOW WE ARE IN CAMDEN FOR A GOOD 
REASON FOR TWO OUT OF IF LAST 
THREE YEARS CAMDEN HAS WON AWARDS 
FOR ITS PROFPLGTS IN ROAD SAFETY 
IT HAS TWENTY MILES PER HOUR ZONES TO 
SLOW PEOPLE DOWN AND WE HAVE 
MARKING WHICH IS TELL MOTORISTS TO 
SLOW DOWN AND DOWN THE ROAD ARE 
SPEED HUMPS THESE MEASURES HAVE 
WORKED IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THE 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED AND INJURED 
ON SCAM DEN'S ROADS HAVE GONE DOWN 
BY A HALF BUT NOW CAMDEN HAS NEW 
WEAPON CAMDEN IT SEEMES NO 
LONDON STREETS ARE COMPLETE WITHOUT 
ONE OR EVEN TWO OR HOW ABOUT 
ANOTHER FOR GOOD LUCK THE CAPITAL 
NOW HOME TO FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY MILES PER HOUR 
SPEED ZONES THEN THERE ARE THESE 
TO HELP US SLOW DOWN THE BANE OF 
MANY A MOTORIST'S LIFE BUT WITH TWENTY 
MILES PER HOUR ZONES THEY ARE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR CUTTING DEATHS 
IT IS BETTER IF THE CARS ARE AWARE 
OF THE CHILDREN AT VERY GOOD IDEA 
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY CHILDREN IN 
THE AREA AND SCHOOLS AS WELL 
WHICH IS WHY THIS AREA OF CAMDEN IS 
PILOTING A NEW APPROACH USING THESE 
CAM RAS IT IS HOPED THEY WILL BE 
THE FUTURE OF SPEED CONTROL THE 
WAY IT WORKS IS SIMPLE AS YOU COME 
INTO THE ZONE THERE IS SIGN 
SIGHING TWENTY MILES PER HOUR WITH IT 
A CAMERA AT THE OTHER END IS 
ANOTHER CAMERA BETWEEN THEM THEY 
WORK OUT YOUR AVERAGE SPEED THON 
STRETCH NO SPEED BUMPS NO ROAD 
HAZARDS BUT IT MEANS IS THAT YOU 
CAN DRIVE THROUGH IT BUT AS LONG 
AS YOU DRIVE AT TWENTY YOU WON'T GET 
SPEEDING TICKETS OR POINTS ON YOUR 
LICENCE 
MANY PEOPLE ARE WORRIED LICENCE ABOUT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS WHETHER 
IT'S THE NOISE OR THE EXTRA 
POLLUTION CAUSED BY SPEED HUMPS 
WHEN WE CAN GET GOVERNMENT APPROVAL 
TO USE AVERAGE SPEED CAMERAS THAT 
WILL BE A GREAT ADVANCE FOR US 
COULD IT BE THAT ANOTHER SPY IN THE 
SKY MEANS WE SAY GOODBYE TO THE 
BUMP BUMP THE BUMP MIGHT HAVE JUST A LITTLE 
LONGER TO GO CAMERAS HAVE TO BE 
LICENSED BY THE HOME OFFICE CAMDEN 
ARE HOPING THE HOME OFFICE WILL 
LICENCE THOSE IN SUMMER THEN 
THEY'LL HAVE TO BE PUT IN MAYBE 
BIT OF LIFE LEFT IN THE BUMP JUST 
YET YET STILL TO COME 
IT'S A DREAM IT WAS 
A DREAM OF THE CLUB EVEN MORE THAN 
ANYTHING ELSE TO BE IN THE FINAL 
HIGH HOPES AT CHELSEA AS THE BLUES 
AIM TO BECOME LONDON'S FIRST RF 
EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS 
AND EURO VISION FEVER HITS THE 
WEST END 
AFTER YEARS OF RISING HOUSE PRICES 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH SEEMS TO BE 
HITTING THE PROPERTY MARKET IN 
LONDON SO IS IT FINALLY TIME FOR 
FIRST TIME BUYERS WHO HAVE BEEN 
WAITING FOR DOWNTURN TO TAKE THAT 
STEP ON THE PROPERTY LADDER 
KEMI LEWIS IS RENTSING HER FLAT IN 
PUTNEY BUT IS DREAMING OF BUYING 
HER OWN PLACE IN CLAPHAM HER 
BUDGET IS TWO HUNDRED NINETY WITH FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
SAVERED BUT SHE HAS TOO MANY UNS 
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER 
NOW IS THE RIGHT TIME 
SHOULD I CONTINUE PAYING RENT OR 
SHOULD I JUMP ON THE HOUSING 
BANDWAGON IS IT A GOOD TIME FOR A 
FIRST TIME BUYER 
WE BROUGHT 
TOGETHER THREE EXPERTS TO ADVISE 
KEMI ON HER QUANTA ME THE IS A 
DILEMMA FOR WOULD BE FIRST TIME 
BUYERS 
IT DEPENDS ON THEIR BUYERS CIRCUMSTANCES IF THEY ARE LIVING 
IN RENTED ACCOMMODATION IT CAN BE 
PRETTY EXPENSIVE RENTS ARE 
ACTUALLY GOING UP SO IF THEY CAN 
FIND A SELLER WHO IS WILLING TO 
NEGOTIATE AND THEY CAN NEGOTIATE 
HARD THEN IT COULD BE A GOOD TIME 
TO BUY A LOT OF THE LENDERS WILL 
DRAW THE LINE AT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AS THEIR 
LOAN AMOUNT IF YOU HAVE ONLY GOT A 
FIVE PER CENT DEPOSIT THE ANSWER IS EITHER TO 
HOLD OFF FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS 
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF THE 
REALLY GREAT INTEREST RATES THAT 
ARE AVAILABLE FOR SAVINGS ACCOUNTS 
USE YOUR EYES SO ALLOWANCE AND SAVE 
UP SOME CASH OR GO IN WITH A 
FRIEND YOUR ISA ALLOWANCE 
A LOT 
OF DEVELOPERS AT THE MOMENT HAVE 
GOT HUGE STOCKS OF FINISHED 
PROPERTIES WHICH ARE NOT SELLING 
ALSO THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS SOME 
INTEREST RATES ARE COMING DOWN 
SLIGHTLY THAT IS ALL GOOD NEWS SO 
WITH TWO EXPERTS ADVISING HER TO 
BUY AND ONE TO SAVE WHAT WILL KEMI 
DO NEXT 
I WANT TO LOOK AT HOW MUCH 
MONEY I HAVE GOT CURRENTLY WHICH 
ISN'T VERY MUCH AND LOOK AT 
WHETHER I CAN ACTUALLY SAVE QUITE 
AGGRESSIVELY OVER THE NEXT SIX 
MONTHS TWO YEARS 
FOR KEMI LIKE 
THOUSANDS OF LONDONERS THE BUZZ 
WORD IS WAIT 
IF YOU ARE STRUGGLING TO SELL YOUR 
PROPERTY OR YOU HAVE GOT ANOTHER 
TALE TO TELL ABOUT HOUSING GET IN 
TOUCH WITH US 
NOW FIVE DAYS LEFT UNTIL THE 
BIGGEST FOOTBALL MATCH EVER PLAYED 
BETWEEN TWO ENGLISH CLUBS KICKS OFF 
CHELSEA MEET MANCHESTER UNITED IN 
THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE FINAL IN 
MOSCOW ON WEDNESDAY MARK BRIGHT IS 
HERE TO TELL US MORE UNITED GOT 
THE BETTER OF CHELSEA AT THE 
WEEKEND CAN CHELSEA STRIKE BACK 
ABSOLUTELY OVER THIRTY EIGHT GAMES THERE 
WAS ONLY TWO POINTS BETWEEN THEM L. 
AM GOING TO THIS GAME I AM REALLY 
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT BUT LONDON 
TEAMS HAVE NOT HAD MUCH LUCK IN THE 
CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE WAY BACK IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO 
SPURS LOST IN THE SEMI FINAL 
CHELSEA HAVE LOST THREE TIMES IN 
THE SEMI FINAL SO IF THEY ARE 
GOING TO WIN THIS TROPHY THEY HAVE 
GOT TO GET RID OF THE CAPITAL WHO 
DO 
IT'S THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER PRIZE IN 
CLUB FOOTBALL WHEN LIVERPOOL GOT 
THEIR HANDS ON IT FOR THE FIFTH TIME 
THREE YEARS AGO CLOSE TO ONE MILLION 
PEOPLE CAME OUT ONTO THE STREETS TO 
CELEBRATE SIX YEARS PREVIOUSLY 
THERE WERE SIMILAR SCENES IN 
MANCHESTER WHEN UNITED LIFTED IT 
FOR THE SECOND TIME IN THEIR 
HISTORY BUT THE FAMOUS TROPHY HAS 
NEVER BEEN TO LONDON IT IS FIFTY THREE 
YEARS SINCE THE TROPHY WAS FOUNDED 
AND NO TEAM FROM THE CAPITAL HAS 
EVER WON IT BUT CHELSEA ARE AIMING 
TO CHANGE ALL OF THAT AVRAM GRANT 
WAS A SURPRISE CHOICE TO TAKE OVER 
FROM JOSE MOURINHO BACK IN 
SEPTEMBER BUT HIS PLAYERS ARE 
DETERMINED TO HELP HIM SUCCEED 
WHERE THE SPECIAL ONE FAILED 
IT IS 
FOR THE FANS AND EVERYBODY THAT 
SUPPORTS CHELSEA WE WANT TO MAKE 
CHELSEA WE WANT TO MAKE HISTORY 
IT IS SPECIAL FOR ME AND FOR 
CHELSEA THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN IN 
THE FINAL BEFORE L. HOPE I WILL 
COME BACK WITH THE TITLE 
IT IS A 
DREAM IT HAS BEEN THE DREAM OF THE 
CLUB EVEN MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE 
TO BE IN THE FINAL ESPECIALLY 
AFTER LOSING THREE SEMI FINALS BUT 
WE DON'T WANT THE DREAM TO STAY IN 
THE SEMI FINAL 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO HALF OF 
BIRMINGHAM WAS BOUNCING WHEN ASTON 
VILLA CLAIMED THE CUP FOR THE 
SECOND CITY AND EVEN THE GOOD FOLK 
OF NOTTINGHAM HAVE TWICE 
EXPERIENCED EUROPEAN GLORY THANKS 
TO THE FINE WORK OF BRIAN CLOUGH 
THE SEARCH FOR LONDON'S FIRST 
EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS GOES ON WITH 
CHELSEA HAVE BEEN A MAGICAL NIGHT 
IN MOSCOW WILL PUT AN END TO THE 
CAPITAL COST LIKE YOU SAID NONE 
OF OUR CLUBS HAVE WON IN EUROPE I 
FIND IT INCREDIBLE 
YES LOOKING 
AROUND EUROPE AMSTERDAM BARCELONA 
MADRID MILAN GLASGOW ALL OF 
THESE CITIES HAVE HAD TEAMS WHICH 
WON THE TROPHY IT DOES NOT SEEM 
RIGHT THAT LONDON HAS NEVER WON 
THIS TROPHY 
BUT AT LEAST CHELSEA 
ARE GOING TO MOSCOW THE COUNTRY OF 
ROMAN ABRAMOVICH 
HE SAID HE 
WANTS CHELSEA TO BE KINGS OF EUROPE 
HONESTLY HE HAS SPENT OVER HALF A 
BILLION POUNDS RANIERI TRIED AND 
FAILED MOURINHO TRIED AND FAILED 
NOW AVRAM GRANT STANCE ON THE 
VERGE OF CREATING HISTORY STANDS 
AFTER BEING PICKED UP OPPOSED BY 
MAN UNITED IN THE PREMIERSHIP ARE 
CHELSEA LOOKING FOR REVENGE 
IT IS 
WHATEVER TERM YOU USE REVENGE 
THEY KNOW THEY CAN BEAT MAN UNITED 
IN ANY ONE OF GAME THEY DID IT 
LAST YEAR IN THE F. A. CUP FINAL THEY 
DID IT THREE WEEKS AGO IN THE 
LEAGUE THEY KNOW THEY CAN DO IT I I AWAY FROM CHELSEA SOME OF OUR 
OTHER CLUBS ARE INVOLVED IN SOME 
BIG MATCHES IN THE PLAY OFFS IT IT HAS BEEN A BAD WEEK FOR LONDON 
CLUBS MY BELOVED CRYSTAL PALACE 
WENT OUT WATFORD WENT OUT WE CAN 
PLAY STOCKPORT TOMORROW BUT 
TONIGHT SAFIN UNITED PLAY AGAINST 
DONCASTER SOUTHEND UNITED SO 
THERE IS EVERYTHING TO PLAY FOR 
LOOKING AT WOULD BE IT COULD BE A 
FAREWELL FOR A BIG NAME 
LOOKING AT RUGBY 
HE IS A BIG 
CHELSEA FAN LAWRENCE DALLAGLIO 
BUT HE CANNOT BE AT THE MATCH IF 
WASPS WIN THE SEMI FINAL THEY WILL 
BE GOING TO TWICKENHAM FOR THE 
FINAL 
I AM NOT QUESTIONING THE DECISION 
BUT ULTIMATELY I WILL MISS THIS 
LIFE IT IS WHAT I LOVE IF YOU 
COULD DO IT YOU WOULD DO IT FOR A 
LOT LONGER BUT IF I LOOK BACK OVER 
THE LAST EIGHTEEN TWENTY YEARS I HAVE HAD A 
LOT OF FUN I HAVE PLAYED WITH AND 
AGAINST SOME OF THE BEST PLAYERS IN 
THE WORLD PLAYED FOR CLUB THAT I 
ABSOLUTELY ADORE FOR COUNTRY 
WHICH I ABSOLUTELY ADORE AND I 
HAVE HAD THE CHANCE TO PLAY FOR THE 
LIONS SO THERE CANNOT BE TOO MANY 
REGRETS 
THE FOOTBALLING EQUIVALENT REGRETS OF YOU WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN AT 
HALF A DOZEN CLUBS YOU HAVE BEEN A 
ONE CLUB MAN 
IT IS A NICE THING TO 
BE ABLE TO SAY BUT I HAVE STILL 
BEEN FAIRLY RUTHLESS AND SELFISH IN 
MY CAREER THE REASON FOR JOINING 
WASPS WAS VERY SIMPLE WHEN I LEFT 
SCHOOL I LOOKED IN THE PAPER AND 
THEY WERE TOP OF THE LEAK L. 
THOUGHT THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD PLACE 
TO START L. HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO 
BE COMPETITIVE LEAGUE L. HAVE 
ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY FOR ENGLAND 
AND WASPS HAVE GIVEN ME THE 
OPPORTUNITY SO I HAVE KIND OF USED 
WASPS AND WASPS HAVE USED ME AND 
IT SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED 
LIFE AFTER 
PLAYING YOU BRIEFLY SAID YOU HAVE 
GOT THINGS TO DO YOU WANT TO ENJOY 
LIFE IS THERE A PLAN 
THERE IS A 
PUN YEAH L. HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN 
A PLANNER IT IS NOT A CONCRETE 
PLAN BUT I HAVE AGREED TO TAKE A 
ROLE AT THE CLUB UPSTAIRS WE HAVE 
GOT A MAJOR CHALLENGE IS AT THIS 
CLUB NOT JUST ON THE FIELD BUT 
OFF THE FIELD WE NEED A NEW 
STADIUM I WOULD LIKE TO GET 
INVOLVED IN COACHING BUT I FEEL I 
HAVE GOT TO LEARN A BIT MORE ABOUT 
THAT AND I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A 
LITTLE BREAK FROM THE DAY TO DAY 
CHORES OF RUGBY AND LOOK AT OTHER 
OPPORTUNITIES 
WHERE YOU WERE HERE OPPORTUNITIES I WANT TO GET HER THOUGHTS ON DWAIN 
CHAMBERS WHILE YOU ARE HERE YOU 
WERE INCENSED WHEN HE COMPETED IN 
THE WORLD INDOOR CHAMPIONSHIPS DO 
YOU THINK HE STANDS A CHANCE OF 
OVERTURNING THIS BAN 
I DON'T THINK 
HE SHOULD AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY 
BECAUSE HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS 
DOING SOME ATHLETES MAYBE THEY DO 
NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING IF IT 
WAS AN INHALER FOR EXAMPLE BUT HE 
ABSOLUTELY KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING 
EVEN THOUGH HE HAS COME CLEAN I 
BELIEVE THAT HE WAS A ROLE MODEL 
FOR YOUNG KIDS AND AS SUCH YOU 
CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO COMPLETE IN AN 
OLYMPICS WHEN YOU HAVE KNOWINGLY 
CHEATED 
ENJOY YOUR TRIP I AM VERY CHEATED ENVIOUS IT IS ALMOST THAT TIME OF 
YEAR AGAIN
