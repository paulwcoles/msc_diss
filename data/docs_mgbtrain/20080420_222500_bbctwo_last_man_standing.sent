SIX YOUNG ATHLETES HAVE ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE OF A LIFETIME 
TO TRAVEL THE WORLD AND COMPETE AGAINST THE MOST REMOTE TRIBES ON EARTH 
ON THEIR OWN TURF 
I AM REALLY BRICKING IT 
OH SHIT I'VE NO IDEA WHERE WE'RE GOING 
ALL SIX MEN ARE MASTERS IN THEIR CHOSEN FIELDS 
COVERING THE HEAVY LIFTING BRAD BRINGS THE BRAWN 
I'M A STRONGMAN EVERY COMPETITION YOU ARE YOUR ONE MAN ARMY 
OXFORD GRADUATE RICHARD IS ENGLISH GRIT 
I LOVE TO WIN I HATE LOSING 
JASON'S A CHAMPION B. M. X. SPRINTER 
WHO FOUGHT HIS WAY TO THE TOP 
THEY SAY IF YOU CAN'T BEAT 'EM JOIN 'EM I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IF YOU CAN'T BEAT 'EM YOU CHEAT 
MARK IS ALL TECHNIQUE A SALSA DANCER WITH A PUNCH 
I'M PRETTY GOOD AT EVERYTHING 
COREY'S A HARVARD SCIENTIST 
I USE MY BRAIN AND A TOP ENDURANCE ATHLETE 
CONQUERED 
AND RAJKO IS A FITNESS GURU 
WITH A BODY HONED TO PERFECTION 
I WANT TO ACHIEVE MY OPTIMUM AS A PHYSICAL BEING 
AAARGH 
OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS ALL SIX WILL BE PUT THROUGH HELL WILL THEIR SKILLS COUNT FOR ANYTHING 
I CAN'T BREATHE AS THEY'RE HURLED INTO A WORLD OF TRIBAL SPORT AND RITUAL 
UNLIKE ANYTHING THEY'VE EVER SEEN 
COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BE THE LAST MAN STANDING 
OUR ATHLETES ARE IN WEST AFRICA JUST OFF THE COAST OF SENEGAL 
IT'S ABOUT TIME WE GOT SOME FRICKIN' BEATS WHEN I THINK OF AFRICA THAT'S WHAT I THINK OF 
THEY'RE ON THE LATEST LEG OF A CONTEST THAT'S TAKING THEM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
AFTER SIX ROUNDS THE LEAD IS TIED 
BRAD HAS MUSCLED HIS WAY TO TWO WINS FIGHTING BRAZILIAN WARRIORS 
I'M BRAD AND MONGOLIAN WRESTLERS 
HIS TALLY'S ONLY MATCHED BY RAJKO CHAMPION OF A GRUELLING ENDURANCE RACE THROUGH MEXICAN CANYONS 
AND SURPRISE WINNER OF A GAME OF TRIBAL CRICKET TO SEAL THAT SECOND VICTORY 
I WAS NEVER THAT GOOD AT CRICKET HERE I'M A CHAMPION 
BUT WITH MARK AND JASON ON ONE WIN APIECE AND TWO EVENTS LEFT TO GO IT'S STILL ANYONE'S CONTEST 
THEY DON'T KNOW IT YET BUT THIS WEEK OUR ATHLETES WILL BE WRESTLING AGAIN 
AND THIS TIME IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGHER THAN EVER 
HE'S JUST MASSIVE 
BECAUSE HERE IN SENEGAL WRESTLING IS MORE THAN A SPORT IT'S A NATIONAL OBSESSION 
I'VE NEVER HAD THIS BEFORE AND IN JUST EIGHT DAYS 
OUR ATHLETES WILL HAVE TO TAKE ON HARDENED PROFESSIONALS AT THEIR OWN GAME 
DAY ONE AND OUR ATHLETES ARRIVE AT THEIR NEW HOME 
IN THE COASTAL VILLAGE OF DJILOR 
SO FAR SO FRIENDLY BUT THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GET A BIT LESS MATEY 
OUR ATHLETES ARE ABOUT TO BE SHOWN JUST WHAT THEY'RE HERE TO DO 
WE WALK UP YOU SEE A FENCED OFF AREA TOTALLY COVERED UP 
AND ALL YOU HEAR IS DRUMBEATS AND PEOPLE CHANTING AND SINGING 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO ANTICIPATE WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS 
ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE SOME OF THE BEST WRESTLERS IN THE REGION 
COMPETING IN FRONT OF CROWDS OF ROWDY LOCALS 
FUCK LOOK AT THE SIZE OF HIS LEGS 
WHEN I WALKED IN AND INITIALLY SEEN THAT FIRST GUY WHO WAS HUGE 
YOU KNOW MUSCLES JUST BURSTING THROUGH AND THE ARROGANCE OF HIM 
IT WAS HERE WE GO AGAIN TIME TO GET BEAT UP 
I'M LIKE NOT INTIMIDATED BUT I'M THINKING HOLY SHIT IT'S GOING TO BE A ROUGH WEEK 
THE RULES ARE SIMPLE YOU BEAT YOUR OPPONENT BY FLOORING HIM 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT SHEER STRENGTH TECHNIQUE AND AGILITY ARE VITAL TOO 
THIS BOUT ENDS WHEN THE LOSER'S HEAD BRIEFLY TOUCHES THE GROUND 
MOST OF THEM WERE ABOUT SIX FOOT FIVE AND BROAD 
AND THEY LOOK LIKE REAL ATHLETES LIKE OLYMPIC SPRINTERS 
THEY JUST HAVE THAT I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING RIGHT NOW 
I'M READY TO LOOK DEATH IN ITS FACE AND I WILL CONQUER DEATH 
THERE'S ONE MORE COMPONENT THAT'S VITAL FOR WRESTLING SUCCESS 
MAGIC 
WELL WILL YOU TEACH ME HOW TO USE THE POTIONS TO MAKE ME BETTER 
COMPETITIONS ARE HELD EVERY WEEKEND 
WHEN THE NEXT ONE COMES AROUND OUR ATHLETES WON'T BE ON THE TERRACES THEY'LL BE IN THE RING 
THROUGHOUT THEIR STAY IN DJILOR OUR ATHLETES WILL LIVE LIKE THE LOCALS 
WITH PREVIOUS TRIBES THEY'VE ALWAYS LIVED WITH FAMILIES 
BUT THIS TIME THINGS ARE A BIT DIFFERENT 
THEY'LL BE STAYING IN A SPECIAL COMPOUND WITH THE LOCAL FIGHTERS 
LIVING TRAINING AND DOING MANLY THINGS TOGETHER TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY 
I'VE NEVER SEEN A GYM FACILITY YOU KNOW AS RICKETY AS THAT BUT YOU KNOW IT DOES THE TRICK 
THIS WILL BE THEIR HOME FOR THE NEXT EIGHT DAYS 
AND THE LOCAL WRESTLERS WILL BE THEIR FAMILY 
GOOD GOOD 
THE FOOD IS SO GOOD HERE 
I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT GETTING INTO THAT ARENA 
IT WAS EVERYTHING THESE CRAZY DRUMS THAT PSYCHED YOU UP BEYOND BELIEF 
THE CROWD KIND OF EVERY NOW AND AGAIN THEY START SCREAMING BECAUSE OF SOME DANCING OR A FIGHT HAPPENING 
AND YOU'VE GOT ALL THE BIG WRESTLERS PARADING AROUND 
IT'S THE ULTIMATE GLADIATOR TRIBAL ARENA 
SIX A M. NEXT DAY AND LOCAL WRESTLING COACH CAMARA IS DOING HIS BEST IMPRESSION OF AN ALARM CLOCK 
GOOD MORNING 
I'M COMING O. K. 
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT 
TRAINING HASN'T EVEN BEGUN AND THE RIVALRY BETWEEN JASON AND RAJKO IS ALREADY SIMMERING NICELY 
I HATE TO LOSE TO HIM 
I THINK BECAUSE HE'S SO COCKY 
I'M NOT REALLY THAT COCKY WHEN I WIN DUDE YES YOU ARE YES YOU ARE 
FROM THE START OF THE COMPETITION B. M. X. BRAWLER JASON 
FIGHTING IS FUN TO ME 
AND FITNESS PACIFIST RAJKO 
VIOLENCE IS A LAST RESORT HAVE ENJOYED A FRIENDLY RIVALRY 
WRESTLING IN BRAZIL RAJKO DESTROYED JASON'S HOPES I'M LETTING THE B. M. X. WORLD DOWN 
BUT JASON GOT HIS OWN BACK DISPATCHING RAJKO IN INDIA TO WIN A KICK FIGHTING CONTEST 
AND THEN BREAKING TWO OF HIS RIBS IN MONGOLIA 
NOW AS THEY'RE ABOUT TO FIGHT AGAIN JASON'S NOT GOING TO LET RAJKO FORGET ABOUT THAT ONE 
SEE EVERY DAY HE WAKES UP 
HE REMEMBERS JASON BENNETT 
IT'S LIKE THIS LUMP ON YOUR RIBCAGE THAT JUST WON'T GO AWAY 
THERE'S NO MORE TIME FOR MUCKING ABOUT 
OUR ATHLETES ONLY HAVE A WEEK TO LEARN EVERYTHING THEY CAN 
THEIR COACH AND FORMER CHAMPION CAMARA KICKS OFF WITH AN INSPIRING PEP TALK 
IN JUST ONE WEEK THEY HAVE TO MASTER A SPORT THE LOCALS HAVE PRACTISED SINCE CHILDHOOD 
BEFORE BEING THROWN INTO THE RING AGAINST HARDENED PROFESSIONALS 
SOME OF THE LOCALS THINK THEY'RE MAD TO EVEN TRY 
THE FIRST THING THAT STRUCK ME THAT I REALLY LIKED 
IS THEY TAKE IT REALLY SERIOUSLY 
IT'S NOT THROW YOURSELF IN AND START WRESTLING WE DO A WARM UP 
GET A NICE PICTURE OF ME SCREAMING WITH PAIN 
THE TRAINING THAT WE'RE DOING AT THE MOMENT IS REALLY REALLY HARD FOR ME 
I'M NOT STRUGGLING 
BUT I'M FINDING IT HARD IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
IT ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE WE'RE IN A FIGHTING TEAM 
THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL SPORT 
AND I LOVE IT 
THOROUGHLY WARMED UP IT'S TIME FOR THE BOYS TO WRESTLE 
I BET BRAD CAN HARDLY WAIT 
HE'S THE POWERHOUSE OF THE GROUP 
I'M BRAD I MAKE THINGS HAPPEN HE HASN'T LOST A WRESTLING EVENT 
I WAS PROUD OF MYSELF 
A THIRD VICTORY HERE WOULD TAKE HIM INTO A CLEAN LEAD 
I DON'T LIKE TO BE DOMINATED 
AND IN SENEGAL YOU WOULDN'T BE BETTING AGAINST HIM 
BUT RIGHT NOW ALL BRAD CAN ACHIEVE IS A DEADLOCK 
WELL DONE 
IT'S TOUGH MAN GOT TO GET THIS TECHNIQUE 
BRAD'S FAILURE DOESN'T BODE WELL FOR THE OTHERS 
I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS WRESTLING AGAIN' 
WRESTLING IS MORE OF AN AGGRESSIVE FULL ON THING 
ME BEING THE SCRAWNY ACADEMIC PERSON IT REALLY ISN'T MY KIND OF THING 
THE GUYS ARE SERIOUSLY STRONG REALLY STRONG THEN YOU THROW THE TECHNIQUE INTO IT AS WELL 
AND IT REALLY IS TOUGH 
AS FOR LIGHTWEIGHT RICHARD HE'S ALREADY CALLED IN THE PHYSIO 
IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS AT ALL IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT OH 
LUCKILY I'VE GOT MY MEDIC ON HAND 
THAT'S GIVEN ME ALL SORTS OF NEW PROBLEMS MERCI 
POSH BOY RICHARD CAN HANDLE HIMSELF ON THE PLAYING FIELDS OF OXFORD 
BUT AGAINST THE TRIBES HE'S SO FAR FAILED 
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN THIS MUCH PAIN 
A GAME OF TRIBAL CRICKET SHOULD HAVE BEEN HIS FOR THE TAKING NOT MANY GAPS IN THIS FIELD 
BUT A RUN OUT GAVE RAJKO HIS CHANCE 
YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH HEROISM 
SO NO WINS FOR RICHARD AND HIS PROBLEM TODAY IS THAT HE JUST DOESN'T LIKE FIGHTING 
DAMN RIGHT IT'S SCARY 
ALL RIGHT RICH RICH GET HIM 
TO HIS SURPRISE AS MUCH AS ANYONE ELSE'S RICHARD COMES OUT ON TOP 
THE LOCAL FIGHTERS SEEM TO KNOW WHY 
THE ONLY ATHLETE LEFT TO FIGHT IS JASON 
AND AS ALWAYS HE'S NOT SHORT OF CONFIDENCE 
I DON'T SAY I'M GONNA WIN IF I DON'T THINK SO I'M GONNA DO GOOD 
PUT YOUR MONEY ON THAT I ALWAYS DO GOOD 
UNSURPRISINGLY COACH CAMARA THINKS HE CAN DO WITH TAKING DOWN A PEG 
SO HE'S PUT HIM IN WITH HIS ASSISTANT SAMBA A LOCAL CHAMPION 
JASON 
I'VE JUST GOTTA USE MY HEAD MAN 
IT'S ALL IN YOUR MIND I JUST TAKE MY TIME AND WAIT FOR THE RIGHT TIME TO STRIKE 
WHAT MAKES IT REAL FUN IS THE GROUND IS NOT SO HARD WHICH I LIKE A LOT 
YOU CAN SLAM THE SHIT OUT OF EACH OTHER AND THEN JUST FOR THE HELL OF IT JASON BEATS ANOTHER TRAINER 
MAYBE THIS TIME THE MONEY ON BRAD ISN'T SO SAFE AFTER ALL 
TO THE REST OF US IT'S WORRYING 
WHEN JASON GETS THAT ENTHUSIASM AND CONFIDENCE HE TAKES SOME STOPPING 
JASON JUST HAS AN INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO PICK UP ANY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAT'S RIGHT 
AS HE CLEARLY RECOGNISES 
THERE IS HOWEVER ONE LITTLE THING OUR ATHLETES HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD YET 
SENEGALESE WRESTLING IS FOUGHT IN WEIGHT DIVISIONS 
AND FOR OUR ATHLETES THAT COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING 
NEXT MORNING THE LOCAL WRESTLERS ARE FIRST UP AND INTO THE TRAINING YARD 
MEANWHILE RAJKO DECIDES TO GIVE JASON A MUSICAL WAKE UP 
EEEENGH 
NNNNNGH 
KNOW WHAT THE WORST FEELING IN THE WORLD IS IN THE MORNING WHEN SOMEONE SMACKS YOU ON THE HEAD 
TODAY OUR ATHLETES WILL BE DIVIDED INTO WEIGHT CATEGORIES 
CAMARA BREAKS THE NEWS 
RICHARD AND COREY ARE THE LIGHTWEIGHTS 
THEY'RE THE SAME WEIGHT 
MARK AND JASON ARE THE MIDDLEWEIGHTS 
HOW IS HE A MIDDLEWEIGHT 
WHICH LEAVES BRAD AND RAJKO TO FIGHT IT OUT WITH THE HEAVYWEIGHTS MR. JOHNSON 
DOCTOR VERY NICE VOILA 
I'M A MIDDLEWEIGHT SUCKERS IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE 
WELCOME TO FAT BOY LAND RAJKO LAND OF THE BEAST 
HEAVYWEIGHT RAJKO MAY BE WORRIED BUT IT'S GREAT NEWS FOR THE LIGHTWEIGHTS 
IT'S THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF CATEGORISING 
BEFORE EVERYONE'S BEEN THROWN INTO THE SAME POND IT'S QUITE NICE TO BE IN A CATEGORY WITH PEOPLE 
THEY'RE STILL VERY STRONG BUT THE SAME WEIGHT NO I'M EXCITED 
I'M NOT GOING TO STAND FOR ANYONE SAYING THE LIGHTWEIGHT IS A LESSER COMPETITION THAN THE HEAVYWEIGHTS 
NOT EVEN THE BEST GUYS IN OUR GROUP ARE IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS ME AND BRAD SO WE'RE GOING 
IT WAS HARD ENOUGH AGAINST THEM WE'RE AGAINST HEAVIER PEOPLE WHINGE WHINGE WHINGE 
YOU'VE GOT THE MIND YOU'VE GOT THE BODY 
NOW YOU JUST NEED THE SPIRITUAL GONNA GET TORN UP WE'RE GOING TO GET DESTROYED 
TRIBAL RULES 
THEY'LL CARRY ON LIVING AND TRAINING TOGETHER BUT NOW THEY WILL ONLY FIGHT IN DIFFERENT WEIGHT DIVISIONS 
THERE THEY GO I THINK THESE GUYS DO MORE PUSH UPS THAN YOU DO 
I BET THEY DON'T DO THEM PROPERLY 
MIDDLEWEIGHT JASON IS CONTINUING TO IMPRESS THE COACHES 
AND THE OTHER MIDDLEWEIGHT MARK IS HAVING FUN TOO THE WAY THEY'RE ASKING US TO LEARN 
IS PERFECT THEY'RE BRINGING US IN GENTLY AND GIVING US TECHNIQUE TIPS 
YOU CAN TELL THAT THEY WANT TO 
THEY'RE ACTUALLY LIKE I WANT YOU TO BEAT ME 
WE WANT TO SEE YOU IMPROVE 
MARK'S BEEN LOOKING GOOD BUT HIS EFFORT HAS COST HIM 
OH FUCKING HELL 
I'VE NEVER HAD THIS BEFORE 
I JUST FELT SOMETHING JUST GO IN THE BOTTOM OF MY BACK 
AND JUST EXCRUCIATING PAIN WHILE I WAS BENT OVER I COULDN'T STRAIGHTEN UP 
OH THIS IS GONNA FUCK IT UP 
MARK'S DAY IS OVER 
MEANWHILE WITH THE HEAVYWEIGHTS BRAD AND RAJKO HAVE A SURPRISE 
IF THEY'RE TO HAVE ANY CHANCE OF WINNING ANYTHING THEY'LL HAVE TO BEAT PEOPLE LIKE THIS 
LOCAL CHAMPION GABRIEL 
HE'S JUST MASSIVE 
FOR BRAD IT'S A WHOLE NEW EXPERIENCE BEING THE LITTLE GUY 
AS FOR RAJKO 
THE NEST STILL NEEDS SOME WORK 
BUT IN THE LIGHTWEIGHT CLASS IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY 
COREY NOT EXACTLY A NATURAL FIGHTER HAS SUDDENLY BEEN GIVEN A CHANCE TO SHINE 
HIS LIGHTWEIGHT STABLEMATE IS RICHARD ALREADY IDENTIFIED AS A GOOD FIGHTER 
I THINK ON MY DAY I COULD SURPRISE PEOPLE 
I'D HAVE TO RELY ON A LOT OF LUCK TO WRIGGLE MY WAY THROUGH THE ROUNDS RATHER THAN BEING A FAVOURITE 
IN THE FIGHTING EVENTS TO DATE THE LIGHTER ATHLETES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED 
BUT HERE IN SENEGAL IT COULD BE PAYBACK TIME 
IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY AND DESPITE THE SUFFOCATING HEAT 
THE LOCAL WRESTLERS JUST DON'T STOP PUMPING IRON 
COME ON MAN 
DOING PUSH UPS AND SQUATS CRAZY FELLAS AROUND HERE I TELL YOU THEY'RE CRAZY 
I WAKE UP TO PEOPLE DOING PUSH UPS I GO TO SLEEP TO PEOPLE DOING PUSH UPS 
WHERE'S RAJKO 
HE'S DOING MIND SLASH BODY SLASH SPIRITUAL DOWN AT THE BEACH 
DESPITE THE SLIGHTLY TERRIFYING APPEARANCE OF GABRIEL AND THIS MORNING'S SUBSEQUENT BEATING 
RAJKO IS DREAMING OF GLORY 
WE'RE GETTING THROWN INTO SITUATIONS WHERE YOU HAVE TO BE CRAP AT SOMETHING AGAIN 
IT'S DIFFICULT MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY 
I FEEL WEAK I THOUGHT I WAS STRONG 
I FEEL UNSKILFUL I THOUGHT I WAS SKILFUL 
WITH ANY LUCK I CAN HAVE A GOOD FIGHT AND MAY EVEN WIN A FIGHT 
IF THAT HAPPENS OH MAN 
I CAN JUST IMAGINE THE CROWD WILL GO CRAZY IF ONE OF US WINS A FIGHT 
RAJKO WHAT'S HAPPENING 
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU 
AND HOW GIRL LIKE YOU ARE 
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN I JUST WENT DOWN TO THE WATER 
WHAT DID I MISS DID YOU TURN IT INTO WINE OH KEEP 'EM COMING 
NEXT MORNING THERE'S A SHOCK IN STORE FOR THE GROUP 
MARK IS LEAVING THE COMPOUND 
I'M DEVASTATED THAT I'M NOT ABLE TO COMPETE I REALLY AM DEVASTATED 
YOU WANT TO DO YOURSELF JUSTICE AND GET IN THERE AND SHOW WHAT YOU CAN DO AS AN ATHLETE 
AS A PERSON AND THEN IT JUST GETS DASHED 
A SUSPECTED SLIPPED DISC HAS SCUPPERED HIS HOPES 
CARRYING THOSE BAGS WON'T HELP 
IF I DON'T SEE YOU BY TOMORROW 
HAVE A GOOD COMPETITION ALL RIGHT 
LET ME CARRY THIS FOR YOU 
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A TWINGE 
IT'S KIND OF TAKEN ME BY SURPRISE THAT IT'S MAYBE MORE SERIOUS 
MARK'S COMPETITION IS OVER 
ONE DOWN FIVE ATHLETES LEFT 
WITH JUST THREE DAYS UNTIL THE COMPETITION CAMARA IS TAKING THE REMAINING ATHLETES AWAY 
FOR AN IMPORTANT LESSON IN MAGIC 
THIS ISN'T PAUL DANIELS STUFF IT'S ALL ABOUT GETTING THE SPIRITS ON YOUR SIDE 
GET THE MAGIC AND THE RITUALS WRONG AND HOWEVER GOOD YOU ARE AT BEATING UP YOUR OPPONENT YOU'LL NEVER WIN 
I'M ACTUALLY NOW REALLY CURIOUS WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IN BLACK MAGIC IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER 
GETTING INTO THAT SPIRITUAL ZONE IS GOING TO HELP ME GET PAST THAT FEAR OF GETTING ABSOLUTELY TWATTED 
FOUR TIMES YEAH O. K. 
HEAVYWEIGHTS BRAD AND RAJKO ARE SHOWN THE BASICS 
DIGS A HOLE LOOKS FOR A STONE FINDS IT BURIES IT 
THAT REPRESENTS THE WAY HE WILL BURY HIS OPPONENTS 
BUT GETTING THE SUPPORT OF THE SPIRITS TURNS OUT TO BE JUST A BIT MORE COMPLICATED 
CAN'T HANDLE THEM 
WHERE'S EAST 
AND BRAD ISN'T AT ALL SURE ABOUT THE FORCES HE COULD BE UNLEASHING 
SPIRITUALITY IS A VERY REAL THING 
AND THEY TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY HERE I DON'T WANT TO GO IN PRETENDING LIKE I WORSHIP THE SAME GODS 
I DON'T WANT TO FAKE THE FUNK RAJKO ON THE OTHER HAND IS FUNKING LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS 
O. K. 
HE'S SPENT DAYS DREAMING OF SENEGALESE WRESTLING STARDOM 
AND HE WANTS TO GET IT EXACTLY RIGHT 
UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH WITH MARK GONE CAMARA IS PLANNING A RESHUFFLE 
AND RAJKO'S NEMESIS JASON IS TO JOIN HIM AS A HEAVYWEIGHT 
AS NIGHT FALLS CAMARA BREAKS THE NEWS 
CAMARA HAD PLANNED FOR THE TWO ATHLETES IN EACH WEIGHT DIVISION TO GO HEAD TO HEAD 
FOR THE CHANCE TO FIGHT THE LOCALS BUT NOW THAT THE HEAVYWEIGHT COUNT IS UP TO THREE 
ONE OF THE BIG BOYS WILL GO EARLY 
LET'S GET IT ON YEAH 
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT I'LL LAY YOU DOWN GENTLY 
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND MAN 
I'M READY OH HELL NO THIS HAS TURNED ME ON TO A DIFFERENT LEVEL 
UH HUH I HEAR YOU TALKING GOOD GOOD 
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE PARANOID WE GOTTA GO AT EACH OTHER 
NO I FEEL SERIOUS ABOUT IT NOW 
ALTHOUGH I'M CONFIDENT I BELIEVE I CAN GET THERE 
WHAT IF I DON'T AND I END UP LOSING IN THIS PRELIMINARY JUNK 
AND DON'T FIGHT IN THE REAL THING 
WHEN THEY SAID THAT I WAS REALLY DOWN 
I JUST THOUGHT WHY DID THEY HAVE TO THROW THAT CRAP IN THERE 
IT'S TWO DAYS BEFORE THE MAIN COMPETITION 
AND THIS MORNING EITHER BRAD RAJKO OR JASON WILL FIND THEIR CAREER AS A SENEGALESE WRESTLER IS OVER 
CUT THE DECK 
THE TWO PEOPLE WHO GET THE HIGHEST CARD ARE MAKING IT OUT TODAY 
ARE YOU REALLY THAT SCARED 
O. K. FOUR 
BRAD'S GONE ALL RIGHT RAJKO 
YOU GO FOR IT 
TEN 
I'M IN I'LL PASS 
CUT IT MAN I CAN DO THIS FOR RAJKO 
GET A TWO OR A THREE 
YOU'VE GOT TO RESPECT IT MAN 
IT'S VOODOO 
OOH VOODOO 
VOODOO NUMBER TWO I'M SORRY I'M SO SORRY 
THE CARDS ARE ONE THING BUT NOW IT'S FIGHTING TIME 
AS OUR THREE HEAVYWEIGHTS WARM UP THEY KNOW ONE OF THEM WILL GO NO FURTHER IN THE COMPETITION 
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME 
BEYOND HOW THAT SOUNDS AS A CLICHE IT REALLY IS 
IF I GET A CHANCE TO FIGHT IN THERE SERIOUSLY NOT JUST AS A JOKER BUT AS A SERIOUS FIGHTER 
I'VE GOT TO TAKE IT 
IT'S FIRST BLOOD TO RAJKO 
YOU ALL RIGHT RAJKO JUST TWISTED MY KNEE A LITTLE BUT AT A COST 
YEAH 
OH FUCK ME 
JASON NOW FIGHTS BRAD 
WITH ONE FIGHT DOWN IT'S SUDDEN DEATH FOR THE B. M. X. BANDIT 
OH DAMN 
IT'S A RESULT NO ONE WOULD HAVE PREDICTED 
JASON THE COMPETITION FAVOURITE WON'T EVEN MAKE IT TO THE ARENA 
I AIN'T IN IT 
I DIDN'T MAKE IT 
I'M REALLY FREAKIN' DISAPPOINTED ABOUT IT 
BUT WHAT THE HELL 
WHAT CAN YOU DO MAN 
SHIT MAN WHY COULDN'T I HAVE JUST MADE IT 
WHY COULDN'T I HAVE JUST BEEN IN THERE AND 
WRESTLED 
AS FOR RAJKO HIS DREAM IS ONE STEP CLOSER 
BUT HE'S GLOSSING OVER A SERIOUS PROBLEM 
ME AND BRAD GOT THROUGH THIS MORNING I MANAGED TO BEAT JASON 
WHICH IS WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO DO 
IN THE PROCESS I SCREWED UP MY KNEE 
AND I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN TALKING TO THE OTHERS ABOUT IT MUCH 
I WANTED TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE SCORE IS 
BUT I THINK IT'S BADLY HURT 
IT'S BEEN GETTING WORSE AS THE DAY GOES ON 
THE COMPETITION IS TOMORROW 
BUT RAJKO'S MOMENT OF TRUTH HAS COME A DAY EARLY 
HIS DAMAGED KNEE HAS GOT WORSE OVERNIGHT 
AND COACH CAMARA HAS ORDERED HIM TO PROVE HIS FITNESS 
THE OTHERS TAKE A KEEN INTEREST 
IF RAJKO BREAKS DOWN NOW FORMER FAVOURITE JASON IS BACK IN 
HE TELLS ME HE'S GOT PAIN ALL THE WAY AROUND HIS KNEE 
DOESN'T SOUND TOO GREAT TO ME 
HE'S SOMEONE WHO DISGUISES THE PAIN AS MUCH AS HE CAN 
SO IF HE'S SHOWING IT IT'S PROBABLY PRETTY BAD 
BUT HE'S ALSO A GUY WHO WILL COMPETE EVEN IF HE'S IN PAIN 
HE'S DONE IT BEFORE SO 
I'VE GOT TO TRY ONE WRESTLE 
AAAAAH COME ON YOU FUCKER 
I CAN'T DO IT CAN'T DO IT FUCK 
AAH 
SO JASON'S BACK IN YEAH 
THAT'S REAL ANGER YEAH MORE THAN I'VE EVER SEEN 
IT'S A DISASTER FOR RAJKO 
HIS DREAM OF COMPETING IN A PACKED ARENA IS OVER 
I CAN'T REGRET ANYTHING I WRESTLED HARD AND BEAT JASON I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG 
MY BODY JUST LET ME DOWN 
I'LL ALWAYS WISH I COULD HAVE TAKEN PART IN THAT 
THAT'S MAYBE THE MOST EXCITING ARENA OF SPORT I'VE EVER BEEN INVOLVED IN 
AS FOR JASON HE'S STILL GETTING HIS HEAD ROUND THE LIFELINE THAT'S BEEN HANDED TO HIM 
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU NEVER KNOW WITH RAJKO 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE'S GOING TO BE IN IT OR OUT OF IT 
I WASN'T REALLY EXPECTING TO BE IN IT AND THEN NEXT THING YOU KNOW HE'S BAILING OUT 
AND I'M IN IT 
BEFORE THE REMAINING WRESTLERS FIGHT THEY HAVE SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO DO 
VISIT THE WITCH DOCTOR 
CAMARA HAS TAUGHT THEM THE RITUALS 
NOW THEY NEED THE RIGHT POTIONS 
BRAD AND COMEBACK KING JASON ARE CONSULTING A LOCAL MAGIC EXPERT 
WHO GOES BY THE NAME OF MICHEL 
BRAD 
JASON MICHEL 
STEPPING ON THE BLOCK FOUR TIMES WILL MAKE THEM IMMUNE TO INJURY 
BUT WORRIED BY THE SPIRIT FORCES BRAD STILL DOESN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF ANY OF IT 
A LOT OF VOODOO GOING ON 
THEY THINK THAT FIFTY PER CENT OF IT IS THE MAGIC AND THE OTHER FIFTY IS THE ABILITY OF THE ATHLETE 
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT 
WHAT HAS BEEN EXPLAINED TO ME SO FAR IS THAT IF YOU DO IT WRONG THEN IT WON'T WORK 
SO I'M GONNA INTENTIONALLY DO IT WRONG AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
IN THAT CASE I'M GONNA TRY TO DO IT RIGHT 
THANK YOU MERCI 
MERCI MERCI 
THE COMPETITION IS ALMOST HERE 
TOMORROW COREY RICHARD BRAD AND JASON WILL COMPETE IN THE ARENA 
FIGHTING HEAD TO HEAD FOR THE RIGHT TO REPRESENT THEIR VILLAGE AND TAKE ON THE LOCALS 
I'M JUST NERVOUS THAT I'M GOING TO FORGET SOMETHING 
I'VE BEEN PRACTISING THE VARIOUS STEPS I HAVE TO DO IN THE INTRODUCTORY DANCE 
I'VE ONLY LOST ONE FIGHT IN THE ENTIRE TRAINING WEEK I REALLY FEEL UP FOR THIS 
BRAD'S A BIG DUDE IT SEEMS LIKE HE ALWAYS WINS THE WRESTLING 
SO I'VE GOT TO THINK OF SOMETHING SOME WAY SOMEHOW TO BEAT HIM 
IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF HE CAN TURN IT ON 
TURN THE TABLES BECAUSE HE AIN'T GOT ME YET 
IT'S A WEEK SINCE OUR ATHLETES CAME TO DJILOR NOW THEY MUST WRESTLE FOR GLORY 
AND IN A NEIGHBOURING VILLAGE THE STADIUM AWAITS 
WEMBLEY IT'S NOT 
AFTER EIGHT DAYS OF GRUELLING TRAINING IT'S TIME TO TRAVEL TO THE BATTLEFIELD 
WHOEVER WINS THE MOST FIGHTS TODAY WILL BECOME THE LAST MAN STANDING 
I JUST WANT TO GO IN AND PERFORM BUT I WANT TO STAY MENTALLY ON TOP 
AND I'M FINDING THAT PRETTY HARD TO DO RIGHT NOW 
IT IS ABOUT SKILL AND TECHNIQUE 
AND WHAT THE WEIGHT CATEGORIES DO IS ALLOW THAT TO COME THROUGH 
I'M NERVOUS IN THE SENSE THAT SUDDENLY I FEEL THAT I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WIN A COMPETITION 
I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY CLICKED YET THAT I'M BACK IN IT 
IT'S GOING TO BE A ROUGH NIGHT IT'S GOING TO BE ROUGH 
AS THE ATHLETES JOIN THE CROWDS FLOCKING TO THE FIGHTS THEY STILL FUSS ABOUT THEIR MAGIC ROUTINES 
IT'S SLAP DO SOMETHING STICK IN THE GROUND 
THEN IT'S THE HAND YOU'VE GOT TO KNEEL DOWN AND ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT PICK UP THE STICK AND RUN ROUND 
AND YOU GO ROUND THE RING 
INSIDE THE ARENA THINGS ARE WARMING UP 
ONLY THE BEST ATHLETE IN EACH WEIGHT CATEGORY WILL GET TO FIGHT THE LOCALS 
BEFORE THAT THEY FACE A SHOWDOWN WITH EACH OTHER 
AS THE LIGHTWEIGHT COMPETITION IS ALREADY UNDER WAY 
IT'S COREY AND RICHARD WHO ARE CALLED INTO THE RING FIRST 
THE MOMENT I STEPPED IN THE RING AND THERE WERE TONS OF PEOPLE 
I NOTICED MY HANDS WERE SHAKING I WAS LIKE THIS IS STRANGE 
IT'S ONLY AT RARE MOMENTS IN MY LIFE THAT MY HANDS HAVE BEEN SHAKING 
I WASN'T THINKING I NEED A MIRACLE TO WIN THIS I THOUGHT I CAN 
RICHARD WINS THE ATHLETES' LIGHTWEIGHT ELIMINATOR 
JOB DONE JOB DONE 
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED THE BEST MAN WON 
NOW HAVING MADE THE VILLAGE TEAM RICHARD IS ABOUT TO TASTE THE COMPETITION PROPER 
MY CONFIDENCE WAS HIGH BUT THE STAKES WERE MUCH HIGHER THIS TIME AS WELL 
THIS WAS A LOCAL GUY I WAS UP AGAINST AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE TO SOME RANDOM WHITE GUY 
WHO'D ONLY DONE THIS FOR A WEEK 
I'VE BEEN BUILDING MYSELF UP ALL DAY I WAS INCREDIBLY NERVOUS 
BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT SHORT SIGHTED IF I SAID IT WAS ALL MY SKILL 
I STRUCTURE MY FIGHTS VERY WELL 
I WAS DETERMINED I WAS JUST GONNA FORCE MYSELF TO HOLD BACK AT FIRST GET THE MEASURE OF THE FIGHT 
AND THEN HOPEFULLY GET A BIT OF LUCK WHICH I DID 
RICHARD'S IN FIGHTING FORM AND WILL WRESTLE AGAIN 
BUT FIRST AS NIGHT FALLS IT'S THE OPENING FACE OFF IN THE HEAVYWEIGHT CONTEST 
I'M SURPRISINGLY CALM ABOUT THE COMPETITION BEING AN ATHLETE IT'S STILL ALL ABOUT WINNING 
I'VE BEEN TRAINING FOR THIS EVENT AND SHIT I'M BRAD I WANT TO WIN AND THAT'S WHAT I DO 
I FEEL LIKE I CAN BEAT ANYONE IF I JUST FOCUS 
IF I TRULY FOCUS NOT JUST TRY TO GET PSYCHED UP BUT FOCUS ON WHAT I'M DOING 
BRAD AND JASON HAVE GONE TOO FAR ACROSS THE ARENA 
THE REFEREE BRINGS THEM BACK TO THE MIDDLE 
JASON CELEBRATES VICTORY BUT ONCE AGAIN THE REF'S NOT HAPPY 
THE FALL WAS TOO CLOSE TO CALL AND THEY MUST START FOR A THIRD TIME 
FINALLY JASON'S THROUGH 
I RAN OVER TO THE CROWD AND I STARTED DANCING 
AND I HAD THIS ADRENALINE GOING I'M RUNNING AROUND THE RING 
AND UH MAN THAT WAS A GOOD FEELING MAN 
AWESOME THAT'S WHAT I LIVE FOR 
THEY JUST WENT STRAIGHT IN I THINK BRAD WANTED TO FINISH IT QUICK AND DESTROY HIM 
BUT JASON KEPT HIS BALANCE AND THEN IT WAS JUST ALL OVER THE PLACE IT WAS WILD 
THEN JASON WHACKED HIM ON THE HEAD AND TOOK HIS LEGS AND JUST SENT BRAD BACK 
STRAIGHT DOWN ON HIS BACK AWESOME 
IT'S A GREAT WIN FOR JASON BUT A DEVASTATING BLOW FOR BRAD 
I'M AS CLOSE TO A SUPERHERO AS I CAN BE BUT REALITY HAS SET IN 
THE FACT IS SOMETIMES YOU LOSE SHIT EVEN SUPERHEROES LOSE EVERY NOW AND THEN 
ONLY TWO ATHLETES REMAIN 
EITHER RICHARD OR JASON WILL BE THE LAST MAN STANDING 
RICHARD IS THE FIRST BACK IN THE RING YOU'VE DONE SO WELL SO FAR 
TO GO OUT IN A BAD WAY IS NOT WORTH IT JUST GO OUT BIG OR WIN 
I THINK THAT'S THE BEST ADVICE 
WHEN I STEPPED UP FOR THAT FIGHT I WAS ON FIRE 
I KNEW THAT WAS A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD HE WAS MY SIZE AND IT WAS A FIGHT I COULD WIN 
THEN HE STARTED BEING ALL COCKY DANCING AND LAUGHING 
AND THE REFEREE TALKED TO US BUT I BARELY HEARD IT I WAS SO FOCUSED ON KICKING THIS GUY'S ARSE 
I WAS ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED TO LOSE THAT FIGHT BUT I WAS SO PROUD FOR HAVING GOT THAT FAR 
THE WHOLE COMPETITION WAS STILL WIDE OPEN 
SO IT'S SUDDEN DEATH FOR JASON 
AGAIN 
WIN AND HE'S STILL IN LOSE AND RICHARD BECOMES THE LAST MAN STANDING FOR HIS FIRST TIME 
AND JASON'S DRAWN ONE OF THE LOCAL FAVOURITES 
IT'S ALL OVER FOR THE OUTSIDER 
I KNEW THEY'D PUT ME UP AGAINST HIM THAT BITCH LOOKS LIKE MIKE TYSON 
HE'S GONNA BITE MY EAR OR SOMETHING SOMETIMES YOU GET THE SHORT STRAW SOMETIMES YOU GET THE LONG STRAW 
IT JUST WASN'T MY TIME TO WIN I DON'T THINK 
WE'VE GOT A NEW CHAMPION 
FOR THE FIRST TIME RICHARD IS THE LAST MAN STANDING 
MY HEAD'S IN A COMPLETE SPIN AT THE MOMENT I NEVER THOUGHT I'D WIN ONE OF THESE EVENTS 
TO WIN IN WRESTLING OF ALL SPORTS 
ME A WRESTLING CHAMPION IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BUT ONE FOR RICH 
YES YES IT'S SUCH A GOOD FEELING 
NEXT TIME ON LAST MAN STANDING 
YOU 
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT 
IT'S THE FINAL ROUND 
WHERE AM I GOING I CAN'T DO IT 
OUR ATHLETES HEAD TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA FOR A GRUELLING JUNGLE CANOE RACE 
IT'S FUCKING IRRITATING 
THE MOST REVOLTING THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN 
I'M OFFICIALLY SHITTING MY PANTS 
HE DAMN NEARLY HIT MY EYE 
FUCK
