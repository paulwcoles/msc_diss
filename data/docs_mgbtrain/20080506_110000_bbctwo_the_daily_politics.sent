AFTERNOON FOLKS WELCOME TO THE 
DAILY POLITICS AFTER LAST WEEK'S 
DISAS TRAUS RESULT DISASTROUS 
ELECTION RESULTS MINISTERS ARE 
MEETING TO DISCUSS WHETHER THE 
LABOUR PARTY IS DOOMED CAN GORDON 
BROWN LIKE INDIANA JONES FIND HIS 
WAY OUT OF THE MESS IF SO HOW 
WE WILL BE ASKING THE MAN WHO FOR 
MANY YEARS WAS OFTEN CONSIDERED TO 
BE THE REAL DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER 
TONY BLAIR'S RIGHT HANDMAN 
ALASTAIR CAMPBELL 
IT'S OFFICIALLY DAY TWO OF THE TORY 
ADMINISTRATION IN LONDON AND IT'S 
SUNNY TODAY BUT HOW LONG WILL IT 
TAKE FOR BOJO TO RING THE CHANGES 
AND THIS WILL BE MUSIC TO YOUR EARS 
NOBODY WILL BE SINGING LIVE ON 
TODAY'S PROGRAMME BUT FLOELLA 
BENJAMIN WILL BE HERE TO LOOK AT 
WHAT SONGS THE NATION'S CHILDREN 
SHOULD BE TAUGHT THIS IN THE 
NEXT HALF HOUR WITH US FOR THE 
DURATION A MAN WHO FOR NINE YEARS 
WAS SORT OF TOM THE CABIN BOY TO 
TONY BLAIR'S CAPTAIN PUGWASH A 
SIDEKICK WHO SOME SAY WAS THE 
BRAINS OF THE OPERATION IT'S 
ALASTAIR CAMPBELL HE HAS WRITTEN 
ABOUT IN IT'S NOW OUT IN PAPERBACK 
I HAVE THE COPY HERE IT'S GOOD 
NEWS BECAUSE I WAS GETTING A SORE 
BACK CARRYING THE HARD EDITION ALL 
THE TIME SO GLAD THE SMALLER ONE 
HAS COME OUT NOW 
AND IT'S CHEAPER 
BEING SCOTTISH WE LIKE THAT 
I WANT TO TALK LATER ABOUT WHAT MR. 
BROWN'S DOING AND WHERE LABOUR GOES 
NOW AND THE PRIME MINISTER NOW 
BRIEFLY LOOKING BACK ON LAST WEEK 
PRETEND THEY WERE ANYTHING OTHER 
THAN BAD HISTORICALLY 
THEY WERE HISTORICALLY AS BAD AS LABOUR FOR FOUR DECADES 
THEY WERE WORSE THAN ANYTHING THAT 
I THINK WE EXPERIENCED WHEN TONY 
WAS IN POWER L. THINK I DON'T 
KNOW IF THIS IS TRUE I WAS AT 
DINNER WEEK BEFORE LAST AND JERRY 
SUTCLIFFE SPORTS MINISTER SAID NINETY PER CENT 
OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT HAVE 
NEVER KNOWN OPPOSITION IF THAT IS 
TRUE THAT IS ONE IT SHOWS HOW 
LONG WE HAVE BEEN IN POWER AND HOW 
DOMINANT WE HAVE BEEN IT ALSO 
SHOWS THAT THERE IS A GENERATION IF 
YOU LIKE WHO HAVE COME THROUGH AND 
DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT IT WAS 
LIKE IN THAT LOSING ENVIRONMENT 
GETTING BATTERED LEFT RIGHT AND 
CENTRE I BELIEVE AND I CERTAINLY 
HOPE THAT THIS IS A MOMENT WHERE 
ACTUALLY THE LABOUR PARTY AND THE 
LABOUR GOVERNMENT REALLY KIND OF 
LOOKS I DON'T MEAN TURNS IN ON 
ITSELF BUT LOOKS AT WHAT'S 
HAPPENED AND DEVICES THE RIGHT 
STRATEGIC RESPONSES BECAUSE I DON'T 
THINK ANYBODY CAN PRETEND THAT IT 
WAS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A VERY BAD 
SET OF RESULTS 
WE ARE GOING TO 
TALK ABOUT WHAT THESE STRATEGIC 
RESPONSES SHOULD BE LATER GOOD TO 
HAVE YOU WITH US 
DID YOU HAVE A GOOD BANK HOLIDAY I 
HOPE SO I DID FOR MANY OF US THE 
WEATHER WAS SPRING LIKE PERFECT 
FOR A PICNIC IN THE PARK AND A 
NICE JUG OF PIMMS 
HOPEFULLY WE WILL GET THE RIGHT 
ANSWER TPE END OF THE PROGRAMME AND 
THE QUIZ AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS ON 
OUR WEBSITE IF YOU YOU WANT TO 
SEND YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT ANYTHING 
ON THE PROGRAMME GET E. MAILING WE 
WILL READ OUT SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS 
LATER IN THE PROGRAMME DON'T GIVE 
THE ANSWER YET THE STORY IS TRUE 
IS IT 
EVERY SINGLE WORD IN THERE 
IS TRUE HOW IS THAT 
IT'S IN THE 
BOOK TOO YEAH 
IT'S SO LONG AGO YEAH SINCE I READ IT 
YOU HAVE TO READ 
IT AGAIN 
WAS SAYING THE 
IT AGAIN WEATHER IS GOOD FOR A BANK HOLIDAY 
THAT'S A FIRST NOT SO GREAT FOR 
GORDON BROWN HE SPENT MOST OF THE 
BANK HOLIDAY IN A DARKENED ROOM 
BECAUSE AS WE WERE SAYING NOT ONLY 
DID LABOUR SLUMP TO ITS WORST 
COUNCIL RESULT IN AT LEAST FORTY YEARS 
BACK TO NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT BORIS JOHNSON WAS 
ALSO ELECTED MAYOR OF LONDON SO MR. 
BROWN NOW NOW WAKES UP TO A TORY 
RUN CITY AS M. P.'S RETURN TO 
WESTMINSTER JENNY IS GOING TO TELL 
US HOW THE PRIME MINISTER INTENDS 
TO FIGHT BACK AFTER YEARS OF 
STRIVING TO GET HIS HANDS ON THE 
LABOUR TREASURE THAT PRUDENT 
ADVENTURER INDIANA BROWN FACED HIS 
FIRST ELECTORAL TEST LAST WEEK AND 
LABOUR'S SWASHBUCKLING HERO 
SPECTACULARLY CAME A CROPPER THIS 
MORNING HE WAS CRACKING HIS WHIP AT 
CABINET FORMULATING PLANS FOR A 
FIGHTBACK IT SEEMS IN THESE TOUGH 
ECONOMIC TIMES HE SEESED TREASURE 
AS THE SOLUTION HE IS SET TO SPEED 
UP PLANS TO COMPENSATE THE FIFTY THREE 
MILLION LOSERS FROM THE ABOLITION 
OF THE TEN P. TAX BAND IN THE HOPE OF 
HEADING OFF THE THREAT OF A NEW 
REBELLION BY LABOUR M. P.'S AND HE IS 
ALSO SET TO SHED SOME OF THE 
BAGGAGE HE HAS BEEN CARRYING AROUND 
WITH HIM INCLUDING THE PLANS TO 
INTRODUCE A CHARGE FOR RUBBISH 
DISPOSAL AS WELL AS POSSIBLY 
DROPPING THE DELAYED INCREASE IN 
DUTY ON PETROL IN THE AUTUMN HE IS 
ALSO EXPECTED TO GIVE THE 
COMPETITION COMMISSION MORE POWERS 
TO STOP PRICE FIXING BY 
SUPERMARKETS BUT WILL ALL THIS BE 
ENOUGH TO SAVE HIM FROM A STICKY 
END EARLIER DAVID CAMERON WAS 
PRESSING HOME HIS ADVANTAGE OVER 
THE TEN P. TAX RATE 
FIRST THING THE 
PRIME MINISTER HAS GOT TO DO IS TO 
SAY I AM REOPENING MY BUDGET THE 
BUDGET WAS A DISASTER IT WAS THE 
WRONG THING TO DO IT WAS IMMORAL 
TO TAX LOW PAID PEOPLE IN ORDER TO 
STAND UP AND LOOK LIKE A TAX CUT IN 
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TO BUY THE 
VOTES OF MIDDLE ENGLAND I AM SORRY 
IT WAS WRONG I AM REOPENING THE 
BUDGET AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING I 
CAN IN THE YEAR TO CHANGE TAX CODES 
TO CHANGE ALLOWANCES AND TO LOOK AT 
FIVE POINT THREE 
MILLION PEOPLE 
I AM JOINED NOW BY 
FRANK FIELD WHO LED THE INITIAL 
REBELLION AGAINST THE ABOLITION OF 
THE TEN P. TAX RATE L. WANT 
TO GET ON TO THE SPECIFICS IN A MOMENT FIRST 
OF ALL HOW BAD DO YOU THINK MR. 
BROWN'S PROBLEMS ARE AND WHAT DO 
YOU THINK HE SHOULD DO ABOUT THEM 
MORE BROADLY 
I THINK WE START FROM 
A CLEAR BASE FROM THE LOCAL 
ELECTION RESULTS WHICH WERE OUR 
WORST EVER IF YOU LOOK AT 
PERCENTAGE OF THE VOTE SO THE 
MESSAGE THE VOTERS HAVE GIVEN US IS 
A VERY VERY SERIOUS ONE L. THINK 
WE MUST START TRYING TO ENGAGE 
WHERE VOTERS ARE NOW NOT WHERE WE 
WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE 
DO YOU TAKE 
ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE LOSSES 
IT WAS YOU WHO BROUGHT THIS TEN P. TAX 
ISSUE TO THE FORE NOT SAYING IT 
WASN'T IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT TIMING 
IS EVERYTHING YOU COULD HAVE 
DELAYED IT IN ALAFTER THE LOCALS 
DO YOU FEEL IN ANY PART 
RESPONSIBLE 
WELL I MEAN YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE QUITE FREE TO MAKE THE CHARGE TO 
THINK SOMEHOW IF PARLIAMENT DIDN'T 
RESPOND TO WHAT OUR CONSTITUENTS 
WERE SAYING WHO GOT THEIR WAGE 
PACKETS THROUGH AND SEEN TAXES HAD 
GONE UP THAT SOMEHOW WOULD HAVE 
HAVE RICHOTED THROUGH THE RESULTS 
YOU ARE LIVING IN A DIFFERENT WORLD 
TO ME WE HAVE GOT AN AGREEMENT 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT THE 
GOVERNMENT'S FAILED TO COMMUNICATE 
THE AGREEMENT IS A SIMPLE ONE THE 
GOVERNMENT IS STRIVING TO COVER AS 
MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE IN A 
COMPENSATION PACKAGE WHO HAVE LOST 
OUT WITH THE TEN P. THEY ARE LOOKING 
AT BOTH THE REVENUE CHANGES THAT 
MIGHT BE MADE AS WELL AS TAX 
CREDIT CREDIT SIDE AND THEY'RE ALSO 
COMMITTED TO BACKDATING THE 
PACKAGES TO APRIL FIFTH WHAT I CAN'T 
UNDERSTAND IS I KNOW THE GOVERNMENT 
IS COMMITTED TO THAT I KNOW THE 
GOVERNMENT IS WORKING ON THAT WHY 
THOSE SIMPLE THREE SENTENCES CANNOT 
BE COMMUNICATED BY THE PRIME 
MINISTER 
SO YOUR BEEF ISN'T THAT MINISTER GORDON BROWN ISN'T DOING WHAT YOU 
WANT HIM TO DO IT'S JUST THAT HE 
IS NOT COMMUNICATING IT PROPERLY 
LITERALLY I KNOW THE POLITICIANS 
CODEWORD IS WHEN THEY WANT TO DO A 
FUNDAMENTAL ASSAULT THEY SAY 
POLITICIANS THE LANGUAGE NEEDS TO 
BE CHANGED L. WOULD GO TO THE STAKE 
IN MY BELIEF THAT THE PRIME 
MINISTER IS COMMITTED TOTALLY TO 
THIS PACKAGE THESE THREE PARTS 
THAT I HAVE OUTLINED WHAT I CANNOT 
UNDERSTAND IS WHY THESE THREE THREE 
SIMPLE SENTENCES WERE NOT 
COMMUNICATED IMMEDIATELY TO 
AMELIATE THE IMPACT IN THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS AND NOW WE NEED THAT 
CLEAR STATEMENT FOR THE BY ELECTION 
GENERALLY WE NEED IT TO GET OUR 
BEARINGS RIGHT FOR WE HAVE TWO 
YEARS ONE MONTH BEFORE WE HAVE TO 
CALL AN ELECTION AND I WANT US TO 
GO IN WHEN THE ELECTION IS CALLED 
WITH CLEARLY CHANGE IN TEMPO IN 
STYLE AND APPROACH AND WE WILL HAVE 
BEGUN TO BUILD UP THE BUILDING 
STONES OF AN ELECTION MANIFESTO 
WHICH WILL BE A WINNING ONE FOR US 
FOR OUR NEXT TERM 
THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH MUCH ALASTAIR CAMPBELL IS STILL WITH US 
LET'S LOOK AT WHAT THE PRIME 
MINISTER'S BEEN DOING SINCE THESE 
TERRIBLE ELECTION RESULTS THIS 
FORMULATION HE CAME OUT WITH AT THE 
WEEKEND ON THE SUNDAY MORNING TALK 
SHOWS MY JOB IS TO LISTEN AND LEAD 
DOES THAT CUT THE MUSTARD WELL WELL WHAT HIS JOB IS TO DO AND I THINK 
THAT GETTING THROUGH A REALLY BAD 
MOMENT LIKE THAT IS IMPORTANT HOW 
YOU KIND OF POSITION YOURSELF AND 
THE WORDS THAT YOU USE AND WHAT WAS 
I GUESS THE FIRST INTERVIEW AFTER 
THE RESULTS BUT MUCH MUCH MORE 
IMPORTANT I THINK GORDON KNOWS 
THIS IS WHAT HE DOES IN POLICY 
TERMS IN STRATEGY TERMS BETWEEN 
NOW AND THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION 
IT WAS INTERESTING JENNY PUTTING 
THAT POINT TO FRANK FIELD THERE I 
THINK WHAT FRANK FIELD IS DOING IN 
A SENSE IS SAY LOOK THERE IS A 
SERIOUS POLICY ISSUE HERE IT 
OBVIOUSLY DAMAGED THE LABOUR PARTY 
WE HAVE GOT TO SORT IT OUT L. AM 
SURE GORDON BROWN COMPLETELY 
UNDERSTANDS AND ACCEPTS THAT MORE 
WORRYING 
CONFUSING YESTERDAY WORRYING MAY HAVE BEEN YOU CAN GET 
CONFUSION YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH 
THE POLICY AND PURSUE IT RIGOROUSLY 
I DIFFERENTIATE FROM SOME OF OUR 
M. P.'S WHO FRANKLY A LOT OF THE THE 
TIME THEY'RE MORE LIKE COMMENTATORS 
THAN POLITICIANS GOING INTO 
PLAYING INTO WHAT EVER AGENDA IS 
RUNNING AGAINST GORDON IF THERE IS 
A LESSON FROM THAT BOOK YOU HAVE 
BEEN KINDLY PLUGGING AWAY FOR ME 
IF THERE IS LESSON IT IS THAT THE 
WHOLE TIME TONY BLAIR WAS LEADER OF 
THE LABOUR PARTY AND PRIME MINISTER 
IT'S DIFFICULT THERE ARE 
DIFFICULTIES GOING ON THE WHOLE 
TIME BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CLEAR 
SENSE OF STRATEGY OF DIRECTION 
AND YOU HAVE GOT TO BE TAKING THE 
PEOPLE WITH YOU 
YOU SAY THAT ONE 
OR TWO PEOPLE AROUND AS BROWN AS 
CHANCELLOR THOUGHT HE WAS DOING A 
SMALLER VERSION OF BLAIR'S JOB AND 
DOING IT BETTER THEY KNOW HOW HARD 
IT IS YOU SAY CORRECT 
MAYBE THE CORRECT PRIME MINISTER IS FINDING OUT IT'S 
HARDER THAN HE THOUGHT 
I THINK 
GORDON HAS SAID THAT IN A SENSE THE 
SCALE OF THE STEP UP FROM BEING 
CHANCELLOR HUGELY IMPORTANT 
DIFFICULT JOB WHICH I THINK GORDON 
DID BRILLIANTLY FOR A DECADE UP TO 
BEING PRIME MINISTER WHERE 
LITERALLY YOU HAVE THIS PRESSURE ON 
YOU MEDIA ON YOU TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY 
WHERE EVERY SINGLE THING THAT 
HAPPENS NOT JUST IN BRITAIN BUT IN 
THE WIDER WORLD YOU HAVE EXPECTED 
TO HAVE A VIEW AND BE ABLE TO 
INFLUENCE IT L. THINK WHAT TONY WAS 
ALWAYS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT AT I 
THINK PEOPLE DO SOMETIMES 
UNDERESTIMATE JUST HOW GOOD A PRIME 
MINISTER AND A LEADER HE WAS I 
THINK HISTORY WILL BE A LOT KINDER 
TO TONY BLAIR THAN MAY BE AT THE 
TIME OF HIS LEAVING AND IT'S THAT 
EXPLANATION OF THE BIG PICTURE OF 
THE CHALLENGES OF THE DIFFICULTIES 
MAYBE MR. BROWN IS NOT UP TO THAT 
WE HAVE SEEN NO SIGN OF IT 
I DON'T 
AGREE WITH THAT IF YOU GO BACK TO 
WHEN GORDON FIRST BECAME PRIME 
MINISTER THE PRRISM THAT DEVELOPED 
AT THE TIME WAS HE CAN DO NO WRONG 
THE TURNING POINT IN TERMS OF THE 
MEDIA PRISM CHANGED WAS THE ON OFF 
ELECTION THING SINCE THEN THERE 
HAVE BEEN REAL POLICY ISSUES THE 
TEN P. TAX I I SUPPOSE HAS BEEN THE 
MOST HIGH PROFILE RECENTLY YOU 
HAVE TIME TO SORT THESE ISSUES OUT 
AND GET PROPER ON A PROPER TRACK 
YOU FOLLOW HAD AMERICAN POLITICS 
LOOK AT THE LAST FEW MONTHS 
CERTAINLY THE LAST YEAR YOU HAVE 
HAD HILLARY A DEAD CERT BARACK 
OBAMA AND MCCAIN 
AND WE HAVE 
GORDON BROWN DEAD IN THE WATER 
THAT'S THE CURRENT PRISM PEOPLE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT I DON'T ACCEPT IT 
WHEN HE TRIES TO CHANGE IT WE 
WATCHED HIM AT THE WEEKEND MY JOB 
IS TO LISTEN AND LEAD WHICH IS A 
FORMULATION AND HE SAYS I FEEL YOUR 
PAIN WHEN YOU GAVE TONY BLAIR 
LINES LIKE THAT HE IS AN ACTOR HE 
COULD DO IT WHEN GORDON BROWN SAYS 
I FEEL YOUR PAIN THE NATION JUST 
GOES OH NO 
I DON'T ACCEPT THAT 
NONE OF US HAVE A RIGHT TO SAY WHAT 
THE WHOLE NATION IS THINKING OR 
SAYING THE GREAT THING ABOUT 
DEMOCRACY AND THOSE ELECTION 
RESULTS THERE ARE MILLIONS OF 
PEOPLE FOR BILLIONS OF REASONS CAST 
AGO VOTE IN A CERTAIN WAY YES 
SENDING A MESSAGE TO THE LABOUR 
PARTY AND THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT GORDON BROWN 
THIS IT'S ABOUT THE WHOLE APPROACH 
OF THE LABOUR PARTY THE 
FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE IT HAS TO 
ATTACH TO STAYING ROOTED IN THE 
COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY LIVE AND 
DOING THE RIGHT THINGS FOR THE 
LONG TERM 
RIGHT 
THE PROBLEM IS IN LONG TERM THE LONG TERM 
WE 
ARE ALL DEAD AND WE DON'T KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS ARE RIGHT RIGHT FOR MR. BROWN YOU 
MUST BE WORRIED WITH THE INCREASING 
COMPARISON BEING MADE ON THE LEFT 
AND THE RIGHT WITH THE JOHN MAJOR 
GOVERNMENT AROUND NINETEEN NINETY FIVE 
BUT LOOK 
PEOPLE CAN MAKE WHATEVER 
COMPARISONS THEY WANT GORDON BROWN 
IS PRIME MINISTER THE LABOUR PARTY 
IS IN POWER WITH A HEALTHY MAJORITY 
IT CAN DO THINGS IT CAN INFLUENCE 
PEOPLE'S LIVES FOR THE BETTER 
ANOTHER THING THEY'VE GOT TO DO I 
THINK I SAID RIGHT AT THE START 
AND I SAY IT AGAIN IN THE NEW 
INTRODUCTION TO THAT BOOK THAT I 
BELIEVE HE INHERITED A STRONG 
STRATEGIC POSITION HE CAN BE 
CONTINUITY AND CHANGE BOTH 
IMPORTANT I THINK THAT ONE THING 
THE LABOUR PARTY AS A WHOLE HAS NOT 
BEEN DOING ENOUGH IS GETTING OUT 
AND FIGHTING WITH REAL FIRE IN THE 
BELLIES ON THE RECORD ON HOW THE 
COUNTRY HAS CHANGED FOR THE BETTER 
WE HAVE HAD ENDLESS RELAUNCHES AND 
FIGHTBACKS HOW BAD DOES IT HAVE TO 
GET THE RESULTS LAST WEEK WERE THE 
WORST SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
FOR THE LABOUR PARTY HOW BAD 
IT HAVE TO GET BEFORE THE PARTY 
THINKS WE HAVE TO GET A NEW LEADER 
I DON'T THINK THERE IS AN APPETITE 
FOR THAT AT ALL 
NONE EVEN IF YOU 
SLIP NEXT YEAR DOWN TO FIFTEEN PER CENT OF THE 
VOTE 
I AM SURE YOU COULD PROBABLY VOTE GET SOMEBODY TODAY WHO WOULD SIT 
HERE AND YOU COULD SAY THAT BUT I 
AM JUST SAYING 
NO MATTER HOW BAD 
IT GETS IF IT GETS WORSE GORDON 
BROWN TAKES YOU INTO THE NEXT 
ELECTION 
THE LABOUR PARTY HAS TO HOPE AND 
HAS TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS 
IS A LOW POINT AND FROM HERE ON 
YOU GET BACK FIGHTING TAKING ON 
THE CONSERVATIVES THE 
CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN GETTING 
AWAY WITH MURDER IN THE LAST YEAR 
THEY CAN SAY WHAT THEY WANT AND 
BAIRBRE DE CHALLENGES THEM 
SOME OF 
US GIVE THE TORIES A HARD TIME NOBODY CHALLENGES THEM IT IS THE 
JOB OF THE LABOUR PARTY 
IN YOUR 
HEART OF HEARTS WE KNOW HE HAS 
BEEN AROUND FOR SO LONG DO YOU 
REALLY THINK HE HAS IN HIM TO LEAD 
THIS FIGHT BACK AND DO IT 
SUCCESSFULLY 
YES BECAUSE HE HAS SUCCESSFULLY BEEN THROUGH A HUGE AMOUNT OF 
CHALLENGES IN HIS LIFE AND I ALSO 
BELIEVE HE HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE 
LABOUR PARTY TO TAKE ON THE TORIES 
BRITISH POLITICS IS ABOUT LABOUR 
AGAINST TORY WHO YOU WANT TO TAKE 
THE COUNTRY IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
I DON'T BELIEVE THE CONSERVATIVES 
HAVE CHANGED I THINK BORIS HAS 
BECOME LONDON MAYOR BECAUSE KEN 
LIVINGSTONE AND LABOUR WERE A BIT 
UNPOPULAR IF YOU FORCE THE COUNTRY 
TO BE CHOICE THEY WILL SAYS AT THE 
NEXT GENERAL ELECTION A BIGGER 
CHOICE I BELIEVE GORDON CAN BEAT 
CAMERON AND THE TORIES 
THANK YOU 
FOR THAT 
IT IS DAY TWO ON THE JOB FOR MAYOR 
BORIS AND NO MAJOR CHANGES TO THE 
CAPITAL THAT WE HAVE NOTICED 
NELSON'S COLUMN IS STILL STANDING 
THE LONDON EYE IS STILL TURNING AS 
THE FIRST CONSERVATIVE ELECTED TO 
HIGH OFFICE IN OVER FIFTEEN YEARS ALL 
EYES WILL BE ON HIM AS A TEST OF 
HOW WELL THE TORIES MAY GOVERN BUT 
WHEN WILL THINGS BEGIN TO FEEL 
DIFFERENT WILL WE BE WAVING 
GOODBYE TO THE BENDY BUSES AND 
EXTENDED CONGESTION CHARGE ZONE OR 
WILL BOJO TAKE HIS TIME TRIAL 
STILL A LOT HAS TAKEN TO THE 
STREETS AROUND CITICORP TO FIND OUT 
GILES DILNOT 
BORIS HAS HAD A FEW OBSTACLES IN 
HIS PATH TO POWER HAS BRANDED A 
BUMBLING CLOWN A JOKE AND SNOOTY 
HE KNEW EVENT WHEN IT WAS IN THE 
BAG SOMEONE NERVY ABOUT THE CHAT 
SHOW DARLING BEEN IN CHARGE OF ELEVEN 
BILLION 
I KNOW THERE WILL BE MANY BILLION HIS PENCILS HOVERED FOR AN INSTANCE 
FOR AN INSTANT BEFORE PUTTING 
THEIR CROSS IN MY BOX AND I WERE 
WORKS FLAT OUT TO JUSTIFY YOUR 
CONFIDENCE 
HOW WILL HE DO THAT CONFIDENCE THE MASTER PLAN INCLUDES QUICK 
FIXES DITCHING THE TWENTY FIVE CONGESTION 
CHARGE BANNING ALCOHOL ON THE TUBE 
SCRAPPING THE MAYOR'S NEWSPAPER AND 
LAUNCHING AN INQUIRY INTO 
BUREAUCRACY BUT SOME ARE WARY OF 
TOO MANY QUICK FIXES 
IT WOULD BE 
IMPRUDENT TO START MAKING DAZZLING 
CHANGES TO HAVE DEMONSTRABLY TAKING 
CHARGE THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO 
UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS TAKING ON A 
BIT BETTER HE MAY HAVE HAD THEIR 
POINT WHEN HE MENTIONED THAT BORIS 
WAS MORE POPULAR THAN VINCE CABLE 
BUT HOPEFULLY HE WILL PROVE THEM 
WRONG 
HIS LONGER TERM PLANS TO WRONG LOOK AT THEIR CONGESTION CHARGE 
EXPANSION TO SCRAP IT TO MAKE IT 
MORE USER FRIENDLY TO PLANT TEN THOUSAND 
TREES AND INTRODUCE AN EYE SCANNERS 
IN RAILWAY STATIONS HOW LONG WILL 
LONDONERS GIVE HIM 
TWELVE MONTHS 
HOPEFULLY 
YOU WANT TO SEE A CHANGE HOPEFULLY FASTER THEN 
I THINK SO THE OTHER 
POLITICIANS IN OTHER COUNTRIES SAY 
ONE HUNDRED DAYS HE DESERVES MORE THAN 
THAT BUT WE NEED A NOTICEABLE 
CHANGE IN TWELVE MONTHS 
AND YOU DON'T 
GET LONG TO DELIVER HE WILL NEED 
ALL HIS FOUR YEARS FOR SOME OF THE 
PLANS HIRING FORWARD TO A FORTY PER 
NEWT COMMUNITY SUPPORT OFFICER AS 
AND PUTTING THEM ON THE TUBES 
REPLACING THE BENDY BUSES WITH 
EIGHT ROUTEMASTER AND HIS ZERO 
TOLERANCE PLANS FOR PETTY CRIME IN 
A BID TO CLAMPDOWN ON WIDER 
VIOLENCE 
HE NEEDS TO SORT VIOLENCE EVERYTHING OUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE 
HIM IT WILL BE LIKE AMERICA TWO 
YEARS AND OUT 
THEY WILL NOTICE A 
FEELING OF CHANGE YOU CAN'T CHANGE 
INVESTMENT IN THE TUBE OVERNIGHT A 
VITALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT IT 
AIN'T GONNA CHANGE OVERNIGHT THE 
VITALLY THING IS THAT RIGHT TEAM 
HE NEEDS TO GET THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN 
PLACE THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT WE 
NEED TO SEE IN THE FOUR YEARS HE 
HAS GOT AND WE WILL START TO SEE 
CHANGE IF HE HAS THE RIGHT PEOPLE 
THERE 
THERE ARE THOSE FOR WHOM THERE BORIS IS A CLOWN A POSH RINGMASTER 
PRESIDING OVER A BIG TOP WITH 
COMEDY BLUNDERS BUT DON'T BANK ON 
IT THE TORIES ARE KEEN TO SHOW YOU 
WHAT A CONSERVATIVE ADMINISTRATION 
CAN A CHEAP AND THEY WILL BE 
PACKING THE BREAK WITH TOP ADVISERS 
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT AT 
BEFORE A GENERAL ELECTION THIS 
PLACE STAYS FREE OF GAS 
GILES DILNOT THERE WE ARE JOINED 
BY THE MOST POWERFUL JOURNALIST IN 
BRITAIN THE EDITOR OF THE SUN IF 
YOU TOLD ME TO SAY THAT TREVOR 
HOW BORIS JOHNSON RUNS LONDON WILL 
BECOME FOR MANY PEOPLE HOW WE JUDGE 
THE TORIES' ABILITY TO RUN ANYTHING 
PRECISELY AND GILES DILNOT WAS SPOT 
ON WHEN HE SAID THIS IS AS 
IMPORTANT TO BORIS AS IT IS TO THE 
TORIES HE WON'T BLOW WAIT FOR 
FEW JOKES THERE WILL ALWAYS BE 
JOKES WITH BORIS BUT I THINK WE 
WILL SEIZE ON SYRIA'S ATTEMPTS TO 
MAKE LIFE DIFFERENT IN LONDON I I ASSUME 
WE WILL SEE SOME ASSUME SERIOUS ATTEMPTS 
I ASSUME DAVID 
CAMERON WILL TRY TO MANAGE HIM I I AM NOT SO SURE THAT BORIS IS 
MANAGEABLE BUT HE IS PROBABLY A 
WHERE 
I MANAGED TO HIM FOR EIGHTEEN WHERE MONTHS OFF 
HE NEEDS HELP HE HAS 
NEVER RUN ANYTHING 
IN A SENSE TO 
BE BLUNT IT WOULD HELP LABOUR 
ENORMOUSLY IF BORIS MANAGED TO 
SCREW UP LONDON 
I AM NOT SURE 
ABOUT THAT IT IS QUITE A DIFFICULT 
THING THEY HAVE TO DO WITH BORIS 
NOW THEY SURROUNDED HIM IN THE 
CAMPAIGN I MET MR. CROSBY IN THE 
CAMPAIGN 
WHO WAS RUNNING IT CAMPAIGN I GOT THE SENSE IF THEY LET HIM OFF 
THE LEASH IT COULD BECOME 
DISASTER AND YET THE SIZE OF THE 
CHARACTER I GUESS IS ONE OF THE 
REASONS HE WAS ABLE TO GENERATE THE 
SUPPORT HE DID IT HELPED TO HAVE 
LONDON'S MAIN LEADING THIS PAPER 
RUN AS A VIRTUAL FANZINE LEADING 
NEWSPAPER BUT THE PROFILE THAT IS 
ATTACHED TO HIM IF THERE GOT 
MISTAKES AND IF THE SUMS DON'T ADD 
UP AND HE HAS A PROBLEM WITH SUMS 
ON THE BENDY BUSES AND ON SOME OF 
HIS CRIME INITIATIVES THERE WILL 
BE A SPILLOVER TO CAMERON BUT TO BE 
FRANK COME A GENERAL ELECTION IT 
WILL BE ABOUT THE PRESSURE ON 
CAMERON AT THE CONSERVATIVES' 
POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES 
REGARDLESS NOT REGARDLESS BUT IT 
WILL BECOME MUCH MORE IMPORTANT 
THAT IS WHY I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE 
LABOUR PARTY MORE ACTIVE IN PUTTING 
PRESSURE ON CAMERON 
DID YOU HEAR 
ANYTHING FROM MR. CAMERON THIS 
MORNING TO MAKE YOU CHANGE YOUR 
VIEW 
I THINK MR. BROWN WILL BE HARD VIEW PRESSED TO STAY ON LONGER THAN SIX 
MONTHS UNLESS SOMETHING DRAMATIC 
HAPPENS AND HE COMES UP WITH 
INITIATIVE TYPIFIES THE ELECTORATE 
AND HIS PARTY THE PLOTTING GOING 
ON BEHIND THE SCENES HE IS 
REMARKABLE SENIOR FIGURES 
RESPECTED IN THE PARTY WOULD LIKE 
TO SEE SOMETHING HAPPEN DAVID 
MILIBAND FOR THEM IS THE ONLY MAN 
LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO STOP THEM 
LOSING HEAVILY 
BUT TO TAKE ON THE 
LABOUR LEADERSHIP AT THIS TIME I I DID BELIEVE DAVID MILIBAND I AM 
NOT AWARE OF THIS PLOTTING I HAVE 
NO DOUBT IT IS A GREAT STORY FOR 
THE MEDIA THAT THE PLOTTING IS 
GOING ON AND I SUSPECT I WOULD BE 
DRAWN INTO IT WERE A GENUINE I I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU ARE NOT AWARE 
THE EYE HAVE NO CONCEPT OF MILLER 
BAND OF MANOEUVRING 
HE HAS BEEN 
SUBTLY AND DISCREETLY MANOEUVRING 
LIKE MAD 
I HAVE NO CONCEPT OF 
DAVID MILIBAND MANOEUVRING WHEN 
TREVOR DOES HIS BOOKING HE PUT THE 
MOST POWERFUL JOURNALIST IN BRITAIN 
ANDREW NEIL 
THE MOST POWERFUL 
MAN IN BRITAIN 
ENOUGH OF THIS 
I THINK THE LABOUR PARTY HAVE HAD ONE 
UNELECTED PRIME MINISTER IN AND I 
THINK TO START PLAYING AROUND WITH 
TWO IS NOT A CLEVER WAY TO GO A A GOOD TO SEE YOU WE HAVE SOME E. 
MAILS MAILS STEPHEN SAYS PLEASE TELL MR. 
CAMPBELL THE ANYTHING TO SAVE THE 
LABOUR PARTY IS TO BACK THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ENGLISH 
PARLIAMENT PARLIAMENT JAMES SAYS WHO STUDIED THE MYTH 
ABOUT GORDON BROWN BEEN A GOOD 
CHANCELLOR HE ONLY GOT 
INDEPENDENCE FOR THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND AND THE TEN PENCE TAX BAND 
IF HE HAS ALREADY UNDONE ONE OF 
THOSE THOSE WE ARE NOT A GREAT NUMBER NATION 
OF SINGERS 
LAND OF CHATTERING CLASSES AND NO 
MORE PAGEANTRY DARLINGS RAISE YOUR 
GLASSES TO BRAVE MODERNITY 
WHEN I GET OLDER LOSING MY HAIR 
MANY YEARS FROM NOW WILL YOU STILL 
BE BE IT IS PAINFUL TAKE A LOOK AT THESE 
POLITICAL FIGURES ATTEMPTING TO 
SING YOU CAN PERHAPS SEE WHY WE 
ARE NOT A NATION OF SINGERS THE 
GOVERNMENT WAS SO KEEN TO GET 
SINGING BACK IN THE CLASSROOM IT 
CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF A SONGBOOK 
FOR EVERY SCHOOL WITH AN AGREED 
LIST OF THIRTIES SONGS THOSE PLANS ARE 
BY THE WAYSIDE WHEN THEY FAILED TO 
AGREE ON WHICH THIRTY SONGS SHOULD 
FEATURE JOINING ME IS FLOELLA 
BENJAMIN IS THIS A GREAT IDEA TO 
PRESCRIBE THIRTY EIGHT SONGS FOR EVERY 
PRIMARY SCHOOL IN THE COUNTRY THIRTY 
SONGS OR DOES IT SMACK OF CONTROL 
I THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE 
BASE YOU CAN WORK FROM SOMETHING 
THAT ALL TEACHERS HAVE THE 
RESOURCES SO THEY HAVE AN IDEA 
BUT YOU SHOULD NOT STICK TO THIRTY EIGHT 
SONGS BECAUSE THERE ARE A WEALTH OF 
SONGS 
WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT FOR SONGS THE KIDS TO SING AT SCHOOL NUMBER NUMBER ONE IT BOOSTS THEIR CONFIDENCE IT 
TEACHES THEM TO REMEMBER TRY AND 
REMEMBER ONE OF THE SONGS YOU 
LEARNT IF YOU WERE IN THE CHOIR 
ESPECIALLY IT HELPS WITH YOUR 
BREATHING IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING 
LIKE ASTHMA TO BE ABLE TO OPEN 
YOUR LUNGS IS WONDERFUL IT ALSO 
HELPS YOU WITH LANGUAGE BECAUSE 
YOU LEARN FOREIGN SONGS SO MANY 
DIFFERENT CULTURES IN THIS COUNTRY 
NOW YOU LEARN OTHER PEOPLE'S SONGS 
SO YOU LEARN ABOUT OTHER CULTURES 
THINNING IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO 
HAVE A GOOD VOICE SINGING IS 
IMPORTANT WE CAN ALL MAKE A NOISE 
I AM BE PRESIDENT OF AN OPERA 
COMPANY AND WE GO TO SCHOOLS TO 
TEACH CHILDREN ABOUT OPERA LEARNED 
TO SING THE WAY YOU HOLD YOUR BODY 
AND EXPRESS YOURSELF A LOT OF 
CHILDREN WHO CAN'T SPEAK WITHOUT 
STAMMERING YOU TELL THEM TO SING 
SUDDENLY THEY CAN SING FLUIDLY 
THEIR CONFIDENCE JUST GROWS WE 
NEED TO HAVE THAT FOR CHILDREN IT 
IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE ACADEMIC 
STUDIES BUT ALSO OUR CULTURE MUSIC 
DANCE AND SINGING CHILDREN SHOULD 
THEN CREATIVELY AND WE MUST NOT 
STRIVE FOR THEM 
ALASTAIR YOU WERE 
THREATENING TO SING THEN IS THIS A 
GOOD IDEA 
AS LONG AS IT IS NOT 
PRESCRIPTIVE AND LIMITING ONE OF 
MY BOYS WENT TO A SCHOOL IN NORTH 
LONDON AND THE BEST NIGHT WAS AN 
INTERNATIONAL EVENING WHERE PEOPLE 
SING FROM ALL DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS 
AND CULTURES AND IT IS FANTASTIC 
WHAT WOULD BE ON YOUR LIST 
I AM AS 
SERIOUS STUDENT OF FOOTBALL CHANTS 
DOES THAT COUNT 
DEFINITELY IT IS 
PROBABLY THE WAY MOST PEOPLE SING 
IN THIS COUNTRY 
LISTEN TO THE 
CHORUS OF LIVERPOOL OR ARSENAL IT 
IS TREMENDOUS THE THIRD OF SOUND 
I STARTED SINGING FROM WHEN I WAS 
LITTLE MY FATHER INSISTED WE 
LEARNT TO SING A SONG BEFORE 
BEDTIME BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE 
TELEVISION SO WE MADE OUR OWN 
ENTERTAINMENT I DID NOT END UP ON 
THE STAGE BUT YOU DO LEARN TO 
EXPRESS YOURSELF 
WHAT WOULD YOUR 
SONG BE IF YOU HAD TO PICK ONE 
ICING WITH A JAZZ BAND A JAZZ ROCK 
BAND I LIKE TO SING MY DAD WAS 
A JAZZ MUSICIAN SO WE WERE 
FORBIDDEN FROM LISTENING TO THE 
ROLLING STONES WERE NOT AS LITTLE 
SO NOW I SING ROCK AND DIAL AND THE 
CHANCELLOR OF EXETER UNIVERSITY 
AND I AM AT THE GRADUATION BALL I 
WILL BE SINGING ROCK AND ROLL 
I AM 
AFRAID WE HAVE RUN OUT OF TIME 
THINGS CAN ONLY GET BETTER 
WE HAVE 
HAD THAT ONE THEY COULD NOT GET 
ANY WORSE 
WHAT WAS THAT ROOM GORDON BROWN 
LOCKED HIMSELF IN 
IT WAS THE LOO 
HE HAD TO SPEND A 
PENNY THAT IS IT THANKS TO 
ALASTAIR CAMPBELL WE ARE BACK AT 
ELEVEN THIRTY AM TOMORROW WITH PRIME 
MINISTER'S QUESTIONS 
JOIN US THEN BYE BYE 
BYE BYE
