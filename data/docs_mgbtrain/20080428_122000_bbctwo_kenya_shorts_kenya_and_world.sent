HELLO AND WELCOME TO POSTCARDS FROM KENYA 
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE FOOD YOU CAN BUY IN KENYA 
AND FOODS SENT OR EXPORTED TO BRITAIN 
FOOD THAT IS EATEN IN KENYA IS NOT JUST FROM KENYA 
BUT FROM MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD 
IF YOU LOOK AT A MAP THIS HERE IS AFRICA 
AND HERE ON THE EAST SIDE IS KENYA 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SURROUNDING AREA YOU CAN SEE THAT KENYA IS REALLY CLOSE TO THE MIDDLE EAST 
IT IS ALSO CLOSE TO INDIA 
I REALLY LIKE CHAPATIS AND I'M VERY GOOD AT COOKING 
COS I LIKE THEM SO MUCH I LEARNED TO MAKE THEM WHEN I WAS YOUNG 
CHAPATIS ARE LIKE BREAD I THINK THEY CAME FROM INDIA 
ASIAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN KENYA FOR MANY YEARS 
AND A LOT OF ASIAN FOOD AND CUSTOMS ARE NOW ENJOYED BY EVERYONE WHO LIVES IN KENYA 
THE MILKY SWEET TEA NANA AND EVANGELINE HAVE WITH THEIR BREAKFAST 
WAS PROBABLY BROUGHT HERE FROM INDIA 
KENYA'S MANY VISITORS ALSO BROUGHT WITH THEM 
DIFFERENT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
IN THE CITY PARK HAWKER'S MARKET IN NAIROBI YOU CAN SEE MOST OF THEM 
ANOTHER MARKET WE'RE GOING TO VISIT IS IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
HERE EVANGELINE WHO LIVES ON A FARM SHOPS WITH HER MOTHER 
WE COME TO THIS MARKET TO BUY THINGS WE DON'T GROW OURSELVES 
IT'S THE BIGGEST MARKET IN EAST AFRICA 
THEY ARE MAKING A CELEBRATION MEAL FOR HER SISTERS WHO ARE RETURNING FROM BOARDING SCHOOL 
THE FIRST THING WE DO IS BUY THE VEGETABLES 
THERE'S USUALLY A LOT OF DISCUSSION OF WHICH CABBAGE IS BEST 
ONCE THEY'VE CHOSEN A CABBAGE THERE'S ANOTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PRICE 
THEN WE'LL PAY AND MOVE ON 
WE'VE ALMOST FINISHED OUR SHOPPING 
THE ONLY THING LEFT ON THE LIST IS FRUIT 
WE MUST BUY LOTS OF MANGOES FOR PUDDING 
THEN IT'S HOME TO START COOKING 
EVANGELINE'S MOTHER MAKES A SPECIAL DISH FOR THE CELEBRATION MEAL 
IT IS EATEN BY PEOPLE WHO LIVE AROUND MOUNT KENYA 
AND IT'S CALLED IRIO 
ALL THE INGREDIENTS ARE PUT IN THE SAME POT 
THE POTATOES FIRST THEN PUMPKIN LEAVES WITH SOME SALT 
AND FINALLY THE BEANS 
THEY'RE COVERED AND LEFT TO COOK 
THEN THE REAL WORK BEGINS 
EVERYTHING IS MASHED TOGETHER WITH TRADITIONAL WOODEN SPOONS 
IT TAKES LOTS OF EFFORT AND EVANGELINE'S MUM IS ALWAYS PLEASED 
WHEN THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE AROUND TO HELP HER 
AT LAST ALL THE FOOD IS READY AND IT'S TIME TO EAT 
ALL EVANGELINE'S NEIGHBOURS ARE HERE TO SEE HER SISTERS 
EVANGELINE'S MUM IS BUSY DISHING OUT THE SPECIAL FOOD 
WHILE THE CHILDREN ARE TUCKING IN AND TELLING EACH OTHER FUNNY STORIES FROM SCHOOL 
EVERYONE MUST TRY ONE OF THE CHAPATIS EVANGELINE MADE EARLIER 
BUT GETTING FOOD ISN'T ALWAYS A MATTER OF GOING TO A NEARBY MARKET 
MUCH OF KENYA IS TOO HOT AND DRY TO GROW ANYTHING 
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON THIS DRY OR ARID LAND DON'T EAT MUCH FRESH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 
INSTEAD THEY DEPEND ON ANIMALS TO PROVIDE VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING 
WITH NO GRASS AROUND THEY HAVE TO MOVE THEIR ANIMALS AROUND REGULARLY TO FIND NEW PASTURE TO GRAZE ON 
PEOPLE WHO LIVE LIKE THIS ARE CALLED NOMADS 
THESE NOMADS HAVE HAD TO DEVELOP A VERY SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR ANIMALS 
THEY KEEP THEIR ANIMALS SAFE FROM PREDATORS MOVING THEM FROM PASTURE TO PASTURE TO FIND FRESH FOOD 
IN RETURN THE ANIMALS PROVIDE MILK AND A VERY SPECIAL KIND OF FOOD 
THIS FOOD IS MADE FROM A MIXTURE OF MILK AND COW'S BLOOD 
BLOOD'S TAKEN FROM THE ANIMAL TWICE A WEEK IT DOESN'T HARM THE ANIMAL 
WHEN MIXED WITH MILK IT PROVIDES A VERY NUTRITIOUS DRINK 
IT'S THE MAIN THING THESE CHILDREN WILL EAT DURING THEIR LIVES 
NOW LET'S LOOK AT FOODS GROWN IN KENYA THAT ARE EXPORTED TO BRITAIN 
LET'S GO BACK TO EVANGELINE'S FARM TO FIND AN EXAMPLE 
ON OUR SHAMBA WE GROW FOOD TO SELL TO OTHER PEOPLE 
LIKE MOST OF THE SHAMBAS HERE 
WE GROW SNOW PEAS 
EVERY WEEK IN THE HARVEST SEASON MY MUM PICKS THEM 
ONCE PICKED THE PEAS ARE TAKEN DOWN TO THE LOCAL DEPOT 
ALL THE FARMERS TAKE THEIR PEAS ON THE SAME DAY 
AT THE DEPOT THE PEAS ARE WEIGHED AND CHECKED GOOD ONES ARE SOLD TO THE TRADER 
ANY THAT AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH GET SENT BACK 
WHEN EVERYTHING HAS BEEN CHECKED 
THE PEAS GET LOADED ONTO A VAN AND TAKEN AWAY TO BE REFRIGERATED 
IN NAIROBI THE PEAS ARE PACKED AND PREPARED FOR THEIR JOURNEY TO MANY COUNTRIES ABROAD 
THE SAME NIGHT THEY GET LOADED ONTO A PLANE AT KENYATTA AIRPORT 
SOME OF THESE PEAS WILL COME TO A SUPERMARKET NEAR YOU 
IN THE U. K. THEY'RE CALLED MANGETOUT 
SO NEXT TIME YOU EAT MANGETOUT THINK ABOUT WHERE THEY MIGHT HAVE COME FROM GOODBYE 
YOUR TOWN 
YOUR STREET YOUR HOME 
IT'S ALL IN OUR DATABASE 
NEW TECHNOLOGY MEANS IT'S EASY TO PAY YOUR T. V. LICENCE 
AND IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE IF YOU DON'T
