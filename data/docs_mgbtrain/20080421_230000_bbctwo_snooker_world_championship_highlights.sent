A LITTLE LATE NIGHT SNOOKER FOR YOU 
ON DAY THREE OF THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP IN THE CRUCIBLE THE 
FINISH A MATCH RULE WATCHING 
EARLIER BETWEEN THE OLDEST PLAYER 
ON THE CIRCUIT FIFTY YEAR OLD STEVE 
DAVIS AND BASILDON'S STUART 
BINGHAM WHO HAS WAITED SIX YEARS 
FOR A RETURN TO THE CRUCIBLE HE 
LOOKED MORE DETERMINED TO MAKE THE 
MOST OF IT 
WE JOIN THEM IN FRAME FOURTEEN 
COMMENTARY FROM WILLIE THORNE AND 
JOHN VIRGO 
A GREAT CHANCE NOW TO 
WIN THIS FRAME 
HE NEEDED THE KISS WELL PLAYED HE NEEDS TWO MORE REDS AND THREE 
COLOURS THEN IT WOULD BE EIGHT 
FIVE GOING INTO THE INTERVAL 
THAT IS IT FRAME BALL STEVE 
STARTED THE EVENING SESSION THREE 
FRAMES BEHIND HE HAS HAD ENOUGH 
CHANCES TO BE LEVEL IN THIS MATCH 
NOW BUT IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TAKING THESE QUITE NICELY JUST NOT ENOUGH FOR A CENTURY 
TOTAL POSSIBLE NINETY NINE HE ISN'T TOO 
BOTHERED ABOUT THE CENTURY HE WAS 
TRYING TO DISTURB THE YELLOW IT IS 
IMMATERIAL NOW HE WILL GO IN THREE 
FRAMES BEHIND AND STILL IN THE 
MATCH HE HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE 
WILLING HIM ON THIS EVENING AND HE 
IS KEEPING THEIR HOPES ALIVE AS 
WELL AS HIS OWN 
HE NOW GOES TO THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL THREE BEHIND BUT STILL IN IT 
HE WILL SETTLE FOR THAT IF HE CAN 
POT THIS RED CLOSEST TO THE LEFT 
CORNER AND AVOID A CANNON ON THE 
RED ON THE TOP CUSHION HE SHOULD 
COME PERFECTLY ON THE BLACK 
HE HAS PLAYED IT WELL THESE ROADS 
ALONG THE TOP CUSHION ON NEVER THAT 
EASY THEY ARE EASIER IF YOU LEAVE 
THE PERFECT ANGLE SO YOU CAN DROP 
IT IN DEAD WEIGHT 
LEFT HIMSELF UP PERFECT ANGLE BUT 
THESE ARE TRICKY SHOTS IF HE CAN 
ROLL THIS IN EIGHTEEN POINTS THE LEAD 
BLACK AND YELLOW NEEDED TO CLOSE 
THE GAP TO JUST ONE FRAME 
VERY GOOD THIS IS PERFECT I THINK 
THE BEAUTY OF THIS IS THE WAY HE 
HAS DONE IT I KNOW SHE WHAT HAS 
MISSED A COUPLE BUT STEVE IS 
PLAYING A LOT BETTER HE IS PLAYING 
LIKE WE EXPECTED HIM TO PLAY 
STUART 
HE IS LOOKING UP INTO THE SKIES AT 
THE MOMENT WONDERING WHERE IT HAS 
ALL GONE WRONG IT HAS GONE WRONG 
IN THE BALLS IT IS NOT LIKE STEVE 
HAS BEEN OUTPLAYING HIM THAT IS A 
TOUGH GAME AND IT IS EVEN TOUGHER 
AT THE CRUCIBLE STUART HAS NOT 
BEEN HERE FOR FIVE YEARS HE IS NOT 
SHOWING HIS TRUE FORM HE IS STILL 
IN FRONT THAT IS WHAT HE HAD A 
STICKY SAYING TO HIMSELF HASTING 
KEEPS SAYING HER 
IN GOES THE BLACK THE COMEBACK 
CONTINUES JUST ONE FRAME BEHIND 
EIGHT TO SEVEN EIGHT TO SEVEN THE CRUCIBLE CROWD IT WAS A 
ENTHRALLED AS THE SIX TIME CHAMPION 
WENT ON TO SQUARE THE MATCH WHAT A 
RESURGENCE FROM HIM NOW WE HAVE A 
CAT AND MOUSE FINISH IT IS STEVE 
TO PLAY AND IT IS DOWN TO THE PINK 
AND BLACK 
WHAT A SUPER SHOT THIS FRAME HAS 
BEEN GREAT NO BREAK ABOVE THIRTY BUT 
SOME BRILLIANT SAFETY 
SUPERB THIS 
GAME HAS NEVER BEEN ALL ABOUT BIG 
BREAKS IT'S FRAMES LIKE THIS IT 
CATCHES THE PUBLIC'S IMAGINATION 
AND HE HAS LEFT THE PINK OVER THE 
POCKET IT IS NOT A FORMALITY TO GO 
PINK AND BLACK 
I THINK HE WILL DO 
VERY WELL TO LEAVE HIMSELF A POT ON 
THE BLACK HERE L. THINK HE NEEDS TO 
SCREW THIS IN IT IS THE ONLY WAY 
THE WHITE WILL COME AWAY FROM THE 
CUSHION 
HE HAS TRIED TO KEEP THE WHITE IN 
OPEN PLAY HE HAS RELIED A LITTLE 
BIT ON GOOD FORTUNE STAND BY YOUR 
BEDS THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT FRAME 
AND THE WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME FOR 
STEVE DAVIS IT'S GONE OVER THE 
POCKET HE WAS EIGHTY THREE BEHIND HE 
LEVELLED IT HE IS ONE BEHIND AGAIN 
STUART BINGHAM GRATEFULLY POTS THE 
BLACK INTO THE CORNER STEVE DAVIS 
WAS THAT CLOSE TO GOING IN FRONT 
BUT HE IS ONE BEHIND AGAIN 
STEVE DAVIS WILL HAVE TO RESERVE 
ALL HIS RESERVES OF MENTAL STAMINA 
IF HE IS TO COME BACK AGAIN STEVE 
IS AHEAD EARLY ON BY TEN POINTS 
HAS HE SPOTTED A RED TO POT IT 
DOES PAST AND IT HAS GONE IN THAT 
IS THE FIRST LONG POT HE HAS DONE 
FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER HE 
IS AT THE TABLE WITH THE CHANCE TO 
WIN THE MATCH WITH THIS VISIT YES YES HE HAS FINISHED PERFECT ON THE 
BROWN HE CAN WIN THE MATCH AT THIS 
VISIT L. STILL THINK THERE IS A FEW TWISTS AND TURNS LEFT 
YES AMAZINGLY STUART STARTED THE 
EVENING SESSION WITH BREAK TO GO 
SEVEN TO THREE SOMEHOW HE HAS GOT UP TO NINE 
WITH HIGH BREAK OF THIRTY ONE SINCE THEN 
HE IS DUE TO START POTTING FEW 
BALLS HE IS A GREAT PLAYER WHEN HE 
GETS FLOWING HE IS AN AGGRESSIVE 
PLAYER WHEN HE GETS GOING HE IS 
LOOKING AT WHETHER IT IS WORTH THE 
RISK GOING INTO THE PINK WE KNOW 
STEVE DAVIS WOULD AND HE WOULD 
PLAYED DOWN THE THE GREEN 
CLEVER LITTLE SHOT HE KNEW HE WAS 
BOUND TO BE ON THE GREEN HE IS 
UNFORTUNATE NOT TO HAVE BROUGHT 
MORE THAN ONE RED OUT WITH THAT 
SHOT 
STILL A LOT OF WORK TO DO BECAUSE 
HE ASKED TO GO INTO THE BUNCH AGAIN 
THE TOP RED OBVIOUSLY POTS IN THE 
MIDDLE IT MUST DO THE WAY HE 
PLAYED THAT SHOT 
HE IS STRAIGHT ON THE BLUE HE HAS 
THE RED IN THE OPEN BUT THAT IS 
THE ONLY LOOSE RED 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET A GOOD ANGLE 
OFF THIS RED L. THINK HE WILL PLAY 
FOR THE BLACK OR CAN HE GET A NICE 
ANGLE ON THE BLUE 
HE TRIED TO GET ON THE BLUE BUT I 
THINK HE HAS GONE TOO STRAIGHT HE 
NEEDED AN ANGLE DESPERATELY HE 
HASN'T GOT WANT TO POT THE BLUE AND 
THE STRAIGHT INTO THE REDS HE HAS 
TO COME OFF THE CUSHION 
COULD HE 
WON THROUGH OFF ONE OR MAYBE TWO 
CUSHIONS AND GO INTO THE PACK 
THAT HAS WORKED OUT PERFECTLY BUT 
STILL HE NEEDS ANOTHER FLICK ON THE 
VET'S L. DON'T THINK ANY OF THE FOUR WILL POT 
HE HAS GOT TOP SIDE OF THE BLUE 
THIS TIME PERFECT 
IT IS THE 
SITUATION WHERE YOU WOULD BE 
UNLUCKY NAIL IF YOU DIDN'T DEVELOP 
AND RED 
HE PLAYED IT THE STEADY BUT HE IS 
ON THE RED THE OTHER REDS HAVE 
COME INTO PLAY 
DOES HE RISK GOING ROUND THE BLACK 
FOR THE SAME POCKET 
BUT HE HAS STILL PLAYED FOR BLUE OR 
BAULK COLOUR IT NEEDED PACE 
DON'T THINK IT HAS GOT THERE IT 
JUST SHOWS YOU TWO INCHES FURTHER 
AND HE HAS WON THE MATCH BUT NOW I 
WOULD SCREW BLACK SCREW BACK AND 
WOULDN'T ENTERTAIN THE PINK I I AGREE POT THE BLUE SCREW BACK 
AFFORD TO AND PLAY THEIR RED INTO 
THE LEFT CORNER 
HE STILL NEEDS ANOTHER RED AFTER 
THE COLOUR AND THAT ISN'T A 
FORMALITY 
IF HE PLAYS FOR BLUE HE FORMALITY WOULD ONLY GET ONE INTO THE MIDDLE 
POCKET NOT THE CORNER 
HE HAS GOT THE DOUBLE KISS CAN YOU 
BELIEVE IT HE HAS TAKEN THESE 
REALLY WELL UNDER PRESSURE STUART 
YOU HAVEN'T MADE A BREAK ABOVE FIFTY 
SINCE FRAME TEN EVERY CREDIT BUT 
DON'T RELAX YET STEVE DAVIS IS 
RENOWNED FOR SNOOKERS AS WE KNOW 
WHAT A MATCH STEVE DAVIS HAS GIVEN 
ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT AS YOU WOULD EXPECT 
FROM A LEGEND STUART BINGHAM 
APPEARS TO HAVE DONE ENOUGH TO GET 
INTO THE SECOND ROUND 
HE TRIED THE SNOOKER BUT IT ISN'T 
THERE AND HE HAS LEFT THIS RED ON 
FOR STUART 
STEVE DAVIS EVER THE GENTLEMAN AND 
A TRUE CHAMPION OFFICE HIS HAND 
STEVE DAVIS HAS GIVEN HIS ALL IN 
WHAT WOULD TURN OUT TO BE A VERY 
VERY GOOD MATCH CONGRATULATIONS 
STUART BINGHAM 
HE PUT BE ON MY BACK FOR AND I MADE 
MISTAKES BUT NOTHING MUCH AND COULD 
AND DID ANY TIDAL TIME COULDN'T 
GET A TABLE TIME 
I WAS PLAYING ALL 
RIGHT AND OBVIOUSLY THERE 
SHENANIGANS ON THE PINK AND TO HAVE 
IT OVER THE POCKET AND TO COME ALL 
ROUND FOR THE BLACK BUT I WASN'T 
CLOSE FOR THE BLACK THEN STUART 
PLAYED A GOOD BREAK IN THE LAST AM AM SPEECHLESS JUST SO GLAD TO WIN 
THIS SEASON'S FORM HAS BEEN PRETTY 
POOR SO I NEED TO IMPROVE SOMEHOW 
THE LAST PART OF THE MATCH COMING 
BACK WAS IF I HAD TAKE 
INSPIRATION I KNEW I COULD DO IT 
FROM THAT SO ALL IS NOT LOST 
STUART BINGHAM'S ONLY OTHER WINNER 
AT THE CRUCIBLE WAS AGAINST THE 
REIGNING CHAMPION STEPHEN HENDRY 
HARD LINES STEVE 
NOW MARK WILLIAMS IT IS ONLY FIVE 
YEARS AGO SINCE HE WON HIS SECOND 
TITLE BUT A FEW MONTHS AGO HE 
DRIFTED TO NUMBER FORTY IN THE 
RANKINGS AND WAS TALKING OF EARLY 
RETIREMENT 
MARK DAVIS HAS BEEN ABSENT FOR THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP FOR SEVEN YEARS AND 
HAD TO PLAY TWO QUALIFYING GAMES TO 
GET HERE NEAL FOULDS AND CLIVE 
EVERTON ARE COMMENTATING 
THAT WAS SWEET 
STRIKING 
I AM TOLD THAT WAS SEVEN FEET STRIKING AND ELEVEN INCHES 
ALL PARTS OF SIX FEET OR MORE ARE 
TAKING AS LONG POTS BY OUR 
STATISTICIANS 
WHEN YOU GET OLDER AS A PLAYER A 
LONG POT IS FOUR FAULT FOUR FEET 
THE FIRST THING THAT CAN GO IN YOUR 
GAME LONG POTS BUT MARK WILLIAMS 
IS STILL KNOCKING THEM IN IT IS 
ENCOURAGING FOR HIS CHANCES 
HE COULD HAVE BEEN PUT UNDER MORE 
PRESSURE BY MARK DAVIS BUT HIS 
GAME IS IN GOOD NICK HE IS 
BREEZING AROUND THE TABLE 
WILLIAMS IS STARTING TO ENJOY THE 
GAME AGAIN IT BECAME A JAW FOR A 
WHILE CHORE 
PRACTICE CAN BECOME TEDIOUS IF YOU 
AREN'T CAREFUL 
SOMEBODY LIKE MARK WAS A BRILLIANT 
JUNIOR PLAYER AND HAS BEEN PLAYING 
FOR HIS LIFE IT ISN'T ALWAYS EASY 
TO GET MOTIVATED AND THAT IS THE 
KISS CASE 
HE MADE LIGHT OF THAT DIFFICULTY 
HAVING FINISHED WITH AWKWARD CUEING 
FOR THE BLACK 
MARK IS STAYING ON THE BLACK FOR 
THE MOMENT THIS WILL BE HIS EIGHTH 
RED BLACK 
HE DID HAVE A MAXIMUM RED BLACK HERE IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE HE WILL TAKE THE DIFFICULT RED 
THIS WILL BE FRAME BALL THERE 
PRIORITY WAS THAT BALL GOING IN NO 
PROBLEM HE STILL HAS A POSSIBLE 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN HAVE SEEN CHANCES WITH MORE 
PROBLEMS THAN THIS A LOT OF REDS 
GO INTO THE RIGHT CORNER THE FRAME 
HAS NOW BEEN ONE WON 
HE DIDN'T LIKE THE FACT HE HAS GONE 
TOO FAR BUT HE HAS THE RED ON THE 
LEFT SO NOT SO BAD MARK DAVIS 
WILL BE CHEERING ON HIS OPPONENT AT 
THIS STAGE KNOWING THE FRAME IS 
LONG GONE NOW THEN 
WELL HE WAS AT FULL STRETCH AND 
USING THE EXTENSION ON HIS CUE TO 
REACH IT SO HE DIDN'T NEED THE 
REST SO NO MAXIMUM BUT IT 
INCREASES HIS LEAD TO SIX TO ZERO 
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS ONLY ONE 
WINNER THERE SOME MORE STORES TO 
AUDREY YOU WOULD EARLIER RYAN DAY 
ONE ONLY HIS SECOND EVER MATCH HERE 
WHEN HE BEAT DUBLIN'S MICHAEL JUDGE 
AND NOW TAKES ON REIGNING CHAMPION 
JOHN HIGGINS ON THURSDAY 
IT WAS A 
STRUGGLE AT FIVE TO FOUR IT WAS ANYBODY'S 
GAME L. STARTED WELL HE HAD A KICK 
ON THE GREEN WHICH GAVE ME A CHANCE 
AND I SCORED QUITE WELL IN THE 
FIRST FOUR FRAMES AND THEN HE HAD 
THE MAXIMUM CHANCE BUT 
UNFORTUNATELY HE MISSED THE LAST 
BUT ONE RED L. WAS PLEASED TO GET OVER THE LINE 
THE MATCH OF THE DAY WAS BETWEEN 
STEPHEN HENDRY AND MARK ALLEN MARK 
ALLEN WENT INTO THIS DECIDING 
SESSION SIX TO THREE IN FRONT THIS IS 
SUMMARY OF WHAT HAPPENED NEXT 
THEY RESUMED THEIR FIRST ROUND 
MATCH THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE 
IRISHMAN LEADING THE CHAMPION SIX TO THREE 
BUT IT WAS FIRST BLOOD TO THE SCOT 
AS THIS WELL PLACED BLUE FORCED A 
FOUL BY MARK ALLEN AND AWARDED THE 
EARLY IMPETUS TO HENDRY IT WAS 
ANOTHER MARK ALLEN FOUL THAT 
DECIDED FRAME TWO THE INTENSITY 
STARTED TO NOTCH UP THINGS NOT 
GOING HIS WAY YET ANOTHER FOUL 
GAVE HENDRY CHANCE AND THE SCOT 
WON HIS THIRD FRAME IN ROW TO 
SQUARE THE MATCH SIX TO SIX BUT IT WAS 
MARK ALLEN WHO FINISHED THE MINI 
SESSION AHEAD THANKS TO THIS 
OPENING RED AND A SUBSEQUENT BREAK 
OF FORTY SEVEN 
BACK AFTER THE INTERVAL AND FINE 
EIGHTY NINE BY THE TWENTY YEAR OLD REASSERTED 
HIS TWO FRAME ADVANTAGE HOWEVER 
STEPHEN HENDRY IS A PROVEN CHAMPION 
AND HE REDUCED THE ARREARS HERE TO 
GAIN INTO FRAME SIXTEEN NERVES SHOWING 
NOW FIFTY SIX OF BY ALAN FOUR AND NINE TO SEVEN LEAD 
ONE MORE REQUIRED FOR VICTORY THE 
CRUCIBLE CLASSIC WAS DEVELOPING AS 
STEPHEN HENDRY BUT DEEP TO STOP 
MARK ALLEN CROSSING THE FINISHING 
LINE THEN THE ULSTERMAN HANDED THE 
INITIATIVE BACK TO HENDRY WON THIS 
MISSED PINK ALLOWED THE SCOT TO 
LEVEL AT NINE TO NINE ANOTHER CRUCIBLE 
FINAL FRAME DECIDER 
WHAT A FIGHT BACK AND WITH THE 
YOUNGSTER TRYING TO PUT THAT MISSED 
PINK OUT OF HIS MIND WE ARE INTO 
THE DECIDING FRAME TERRY GRIFFITHS 
AND CLIVE EVERTON HAD THE RINGSIDE 
SEATS WE JOIN IT WITH MARK ALLEN 
AT THE TABLE 
HE COULD NOT DO A LOT WITH THAT IT 
WAS AN AWKWARD BRIDGE AND VERY 
THIN CUT THE CHANCE HAS GONE 
THOUGH CLIVE 
YES WITH HIM 
MISSING THE BOAT IN THE LAST FRAME 
WITH A MATCH CLINCHING CHANCE 
MAYBE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE HIS DAY 
AFTER ALL BUT STILL HENDRY HAS 
GOT TO MAKE IT THAT WAY 
HE JUST FLOATS IT IN BEAUTIFUL 
SHOT 
HAS HE COME FAR ENOUGH THERE THE 
BLACK WILL ONLY GO IN ONE POCKET L. 
THINK HE IS O. K. HE CAN JUST ABOUT 
HOLD FOR THE BLACK WELL PLAYED 
FORGET ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF 
THE SHOTS JUST PLAY THE BALLS 
USED THE PHRASE BY STEVE DAVIS TO 
PLAYING AS IF IT MEANS NOTHING 
WHEN IT MEANS EVERYTHING 
NOBODY IS 
GOING TO QUESTION IF STEPHEN HENDRY 
HAS GOT THE BOTTLE TO WIN THE FRAME 
FROM HERE HE HAS SHOWN SO MANY 
TIMES IN CLOSE FINISHES OVER THE 
YEARS HE CAN RISE TO THE OCCASION 
HE IS HAVING A GOOD LOOK AT 
SOMETHING I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS 
IT IS WHETHER THE BLACK GOES IT 
MUST BE IT'S THE ONLY THING HE 
COULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE 
BLACK WAS OFF ITS SPOT PREVIOUSLY 
HE'S HAVING A GOOD LOOK HERE WE 
WILL SOON FIND OUT 
NOW HE HAS A CHANCE TO POT THE 
BLUE IF HE WANTS TO STUN DOWN FOR 
THE RED JUST ABOVE THE BLACK 
IT'S GONE TOO FAR HE CAN STILL POT 
IT BUT HE WILL WANT TO POT THAT 
RED AND DISLODGE THE RED TO THE 
LEFT OF THE BLACK OUT OF THE WAY 
THAT WILL CLEAR THINGS UP FOR HIM 
IT STILL A POSSIBILITY JUST GOT TO 
KEEP PUTTING THEM POTTING 
MARK ALLEN WONDERING IF HE'S GOING 
TO GET ANOTHER CHANCE 
THERE'S NOBODY BETTER THAN STEPHEN 
HENDRY AT PLAYING LITTLE NUDGES 
OPENING UP BALLS NOW HE'S LOOKING 
IF THE PINK WILL GO INTO THE LEFT 
CORNER THAT BLACK IS STILL TIDE UP 
HE'S LOOKING AT THIS RED NOW HE 
TRIED TO NUDGE THE RED TO THE LEFT 
OF THE BLACK OUT OF THE WAY THAT 
WOULD BE A VERY BRAVE SHOT AT THIS 
STAGE 
HENDRY IS LOOKING SELF POSSESSED 
JUST LIKE HE USED TO 
IT'S TOO THIN TO TRY IT IN THE 
MIDDLE POCKET CLEAN AS A WHISTLE 
SOMETHING OMINOUS ABOUT HIS 
DEMEANOUR AROUND THE TABLE HE 
LOOKS IN CONTROL OF HIMSELF HIS 
CUE ACTION SO FAR IN CONTROL OF 
THE CUE BALL AS WELL BUT HE HAS 
LEFT HIMSELF A LITTLE BIT TO DO 
HE'S GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER IT 
WILL BE TOUGH ON MARK ALLEN IF 
STEPHEN HENDRY GOES ON AND WINS 
THIS FRAME THE ONLY CHANCE HE HAD 
IN THIS FRAME HE WENT IN OFF BUT 
HE HAS HAD CHANCES EARLIER ON 
CLIVE 
YES AND OF COURSE AS WE SEE CLIVE THE REPLAY OF THE IN OFF EARLIER IN 
THIS FRAME IT WAS LARGELY HIS OWN 
FAULT HE LOST A COUPLE OF FRAMES 
EARLIER ON IN THIS SESSION 
EXTRAORDINARY FRAMES THEY WORK 
FOULING THE BALL WITH HIS SLEEVE 
THEY WERE NOT MAKING SURE OF THE 
OPENING FRAME NEEDING TWO SNOOKERS 
BUT IN NO WAY IS THAT TO UNDERVALUE 
THE QUALITY OF HENDRY'S PERFORMANCE 
THE NEW GENERATION ARE HAVING 
SOMETHING TO SAVE BUT THIS 
AFTERNOON BELONGS TO THE OLD KING 
HE'S SHOWN GREAT RESOLUTION 
IMMACULATE CONTROL WHEN IT MATTERED 
MOST IT HAS BEEN QUITE LIKE OLD 
TIMES WHEN SO OFTEN IN THE 
DECIDING FRAME HENDRY WON IT IN A 
SINGLE SCORING VISIT 
QUITE SIMPLE AN ENTHRALLING MATCH 
THE OLDER GENERATION HOLDS OFF THE 
NEW FOR NOW STEPHEN HENDRY ENJOYS 
A MOMENT OF TRIUMPH AT HIS OLD 
STAMPING GROUND 
THAT WAS DEFINITELY PROBABLY THE 
TOUGHEST FIRST ROUND MATCH I HAVE 
EVER WON SINCE COMING TO THE 
CRUCIBLE L. HAD MY BACK AGAINST THE 
WALL THE WHOLE MATCH HE KEEPS 
POTTING BALLS THE WHOLE TIME AND IT 
GETS BIT ANNOYING AFTER A WHILE 
WHEN YOU EXPECT HIM TO MISS I I THINK I PLAYED THE BETTER SNOOKER 
OVER THE WHOLE MATCH AND THAT IS 
MORE DISAPPOINTING HE SHOWED HIS 
EXPERIENCE TOWARDS THE END TO COME 
BACK WELL HE PLAYED THE PERFECT 
LAST FRAME L. HAD JUST COST MYSELF 
THE TOP SIXTEEN PLACE WHICH IS THE MOST 
DISAPPOINTING L. DON'T KNOW WHAT TO 
DO I AM DISAPPOINTED 
THIS IS WHY 
WE COME HERE IT IS TORTURE AT SOME 
STAGES BUT WHEN YOU GET OVER THE 
LINE THERE IS NO BETTER FEELING 
CONFLICTING EMOTIONS SUMMED UP IN 
THOSE QUOTES AS FOR MARK ALLEN 
THERE IS CHANCE HE CAN MAKE IT TO 
THE TOP SIXTEEN FOR NEXT SEASON 
DEPENDING ON HOW OTHER RESULTS GO 
BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR HAT OFF 
TO STEPHEN HENDRY AS THESE FORMER 
CHAMPIONS HAVE PROVEN TONIGHT 
THERE IS LIFE IN THE OLD DOGS YET 
SNOOKER EXTRA IS COMING NOW 
OTHERWISE WILL BE BE BACK TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON WITH MARK WILLIAMS IN 
COMMAND AND THE FAR EASTERN AFFAIR 
WITH DING JUNHUI AND MARCO FU WE 
WON LEAVE YOU WITH MEMORIES AT 
ANOTHER BATTLER AT THE CRUCIBLE 
AND THAT IS CLIFF THORBURN
