HELLO AND WELCOME TO TOP GEAR 
NOW THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
NOW IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT 
TO REASSURE YOU ALL THAT EVERYTHING YOU SEE ON THIS SHOW IS FOR REAL 
YES NOTHING ON THIS SHOW IS FAKED IN ANY WAY 
WHICH MAKES IT ALL THE MORE AMAZING WHEN YOU SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT LINED UP 
OVER THE NEXT TEN WEEKS 
NO CARS GO BY ARCADE FIRE 
HOLD ONTO YOUR SPLEEN EVERYONE 
NO NO NO 
MAYDAY 
UNBELIEVABLE 
YOU LOOK LIKE A GAY COWBOY AND YOU LOOK LIKE A GAY TERRORIST 
OH MY EYES 
OH DEAR 
AH OOH 
HE IS THE STIG'S AFRICAN COUSIN 
MM AH THAT'S NOT GONE WELL 
POWER 
I AM THE ROAD WARRIOR 
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD 
RIGHT RIGHT ON WITH TONIGHT 
YES INDEED 
EVERY YEAR THE WORLD'S GOLF G. T. I. ENTHUSIASTS 
CONGREGATE IN A FIELD IN AUSTRIA AND TALK ABOUT FUEL INJECTION 
AND WEAR JUMPERS WITH G. T. I. ON THEM AND FRANKLY 
I'D RATHER BLOWTORCH MY NIPPLES OFF BUT 
VOLKSWAGEN EVERY YEAR SENDS THEM A LITTLE PRESENT 
A CONCEPT CAR OF SOME KIND TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR LOYALTY 
THIS YEAR THOUGH DISASTER VOLKSWAGEN FORGOT 
EIGHT WEEKS TO GO 
THEY HAD TO BUILD SOMETHING ANYTHING TO KEEP THE FANS HAPPY 
LUCKILY VOLKSWAGEN OWNS LOTS OF OTHER CAR COMPANIES 
BENTLEY BUGATTI LAMBORGHINI 
SKODA AUDI AND SEAT 
SO THEY HAD A BIG BIN TO RUMMAGE AROUND IN FOR PARTS 
WHAT THEY DID THEN WITH THE CLOCK TICKING 
WAS TAKE THE REAR AXLE AND BRAKES FROM A LAMBORGHINI GALLARDO 
THE TWIN TURBO CHARGED W. TWELVE ENGINE FROM A BENTLEY CONTINENTAL 
AND THE REAR SUB FRAME AND FLOOR FROM AN AUDI R. EIGHT 
AND THEN THEY PUT ALL THESE BITS AND PIECES IN THE BODY OF A GOLF 
AND HERE IT IS 
IT'S CALLED THE G. T. I. W. TWELVE 
AND UNLIKE MOST CONCEPT CARS IT ACTUALLY WORKS 
SORT OF 
AS YOU'D EXPECT WITH A CAR MADE SO QUICKLY 
THERE ARE ONE OR TWO ISSUES 
THE PADDLES HERE ON THE STEERING WHEEL FOR THE GEARBOX DON'T WORK 
ER THESE SWITCHES HERE THEY DON'T WORK 
SAT NAV DOES WORK BUT THINKS IT'S IN GERMANY 
AND THESE HEATING AND VENTILATION KNOBS AREN'T CONNECTED TO ANYTHING 
SO I'M VERY HOT 
THE SIX LITRE SIX FORTY H. P. TWELVE CYLINDER ENGINE THOUGH 
THAT WORKS JUST FINE 
AS A RESULT THIS CAR WILL GET FROM ZERO SIXTY IN THIRTY FIVE SECONDS 
AND IT WILL KEEP ON ACCELERATING ALL THE WAY TO TWO HUNDRED TWO 
TO CONTAIN ALL THE POWER AND THE FURY 
THE W. TWELVE IS SIX INCHES WIDER 
AND THREE INCHES LOWER THAN A NORMAL GOLF 
THE ROOF IS MADE FROM CARBON FIBRE 
THE TYRES SIT LIKE SMEARS OF PAINT ON THE WHEELS 
AND THE ENGINE IS WHERE YOU'D EXPECT TO FIND THE BACK SEATS 
TO COOL IT THERE ARE MASSIVE INTAKE VENTS IN THE SILLS 
THAT'S WHY THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR IS SWOLLEN 
LIKE YOUR GRANNY'S ANKLES 
AND THEY MADE ALL THESE CHANGES IN JUST EIGHT WEEKS 
HOWEVER DID THEY LOSE 
THE FUNNY THING IS YOU SIT HERE LOOKING AT A GOLF DASHBOARD AND A GOLF BONNET 
THROUGH A GOLF WINDSCREEN AND YOU THINK IT'S A GOLF 
BUT IT SO ISN'T 
IT'S NOT A PARTICULARLY SAVAGE CAR 
IT DOESN'T EXPLODE WHEN YOU STAMP ON THE ACCELERATOR 
IT'S JUST THIS SURGE OF POWER THAT TAKES YOU UP TO FIVE FIVE HUNDRED R. P. M. 
AND THEN THE SURGE BECOMES A FLOOD 
I CAN'T GET AWAY FROM IT 
IT IS AN INSANE CAR THIS 
OPENING UP A GOLF TO FIND IT HAS SIX FORTY H. P. 
IS LIKE OPENING UP GORDON BROWN'S TROUSERS 
AND FINDING HE'S WEARING STOCKINGS AND SUSPENDERS 
MAD 
UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS A SMALL PROBLEM 
THIS CAR WILL NOT GO ROUND CORNERS 
TYRES SQUEAL 
THE WHEELBASE IS SHORT AND IT'S REAR WHEEL DRIVE SO YOU HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY GENTLE 
YOU HAVE TO TREAT ALL THE CONTROLS LIKE THEY'RE MADE OF GLASS 
EVEN IF YOU'RE REALLY GENTLE YOU'LL STILL YES YES 
YOU'LL STILL END UP COMING OUT OF THE CORNER BACKWARDS LIKE THAT 
I MEANT THAT 
TAME THE UNDER STEER THERE'S A LOT 
I'VE GOT IT NO I HAVEN'T 
AN HOUR LATER I RECKONED I WAS GETTING SOMEWHERE 
COME ON COME ON COME ON 
YES 
THAT DOESN'T WORK EITHER 
I THINK THE KINDEST THING I CAN SAY ABOUT THE BRAKES AND SUSPENSION 
IS THEY'RE NOT FINISHED YET 
YOU'RE SUCH A SPANNER 
I COULD HAVE DONE THAT 
IT JUST GOES EURGH AND THERE'S SMOKE EVERYWHERE 
YOU WERE I WASN'T YOU WERE 
I WASN'T LET ME GET ONE THING CLEAR 
THIS ISN'T GOING TO GO ON SALE IS IT 
NO VOLKSWAGEN SENT IT TO US COS THEY SAID IF PEOPLE LIKE IT WE'LL PUT IT INTO PRODUCTION 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET ANY ENCOURAGEMENT FROM ME THAT IS GHASTLY 
MY BIGGEST PROBLEM IS I CAN'T SEE THE POINT IN SAYING 
I'VE GOT A SUPERCAR AND THE GREAT THING IS IT LOOKS LIKE A GOLF 
THAT'S LIKE SAYING I'M MARRIED TO A SUPERMODEL AND THE GREAT THING IS SHE LOOKS LIKE A TRAFFIC WARDEN 
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE EVEN SO WE MUST NOW SEE HOW QUICKLY IT CAN CRASH ON OUR TRACK 
AND FOR THAT WE NEED OUR TAME RACING DRIVER 
YEAH SOME SAY THAT HIS SCROTUM HAS ITS OWN SMALL GRAVITY FIELD 
AND THAT BECAUSE OUR PRODUCER RIGGED A PHONE VOTE 
HE NOW HAS A NEW NAME 
ALL WE KNOW IS HE'S CALLED CUDDLES 
AND HE'S OFF WE KNOW THIS CAR IS FRISKY 
BUT IF ANYONE CAN TAME IT THIS IS THE MAN 
FIRST CORNER TWITCHY ON THE BRAKING 
TYRES HOWLING IN PAIN 
BACK ON THE POWER NICELY DONE 
NO C. D. TODAY BECAUSE PREDICTABLY THE STEREO DOESN'T WORK 
O. K. THROUGH CHICAGO NURSING IT ROUND THERE CAREFULLY 
ANOTHER HUGE SURGE OF POWER COMING UP TO HAMMERHEAD 
WIGGLING ITS HIPS UNDER THE BRAKES HE'S CHUCKED IT IN 
IT'S BITING BACK 
OOH HE'S HAVING TO FIGHT IT EVERY INCH OF THE WAY 
LISTEN TO THAT 
IN THE BENTLEY THAT ENGINE IS AS QUIET AS A STARTLED DEER 
HERE IT'S LIKE BEING CHASED BY AN IMPLODING STAR 
AND ABOUT AS SCARY 
WINDING IT UP HERE HE COMES NOW THROUGH THE TYRES 
OH YEAH LOOKING GOOD ISH 
JUST TWO ACCIDENTS WAITING TO HAPPEN 
TURNS IN LOOK AT THE OVER STEER 
CUDDLES IS REALLY HAVING TO WRESTLE IT THROUGH THERE 
UP TO GAMBON HE'S TAKING IT VERY GINGERLY AND I'M NOT SURPRISED 
HERE WE ARE AND ACROSS THE LINE 
GOT THE TIME HERE 
THE TIME IS 
ONE POINT SIX 
SO TOP GEAR TOP TIP 
IF YOU WANT A SLOW CAR THAT LOOKS LIKE A GOLF GET A GOLF 
IT'S INTERESTING THE STIG DIDN'T SPIN THAT CAR ONCE ON THAT LAP 
ANYWAY IT'S TIME FOR THE NEWS 
YOU MIGHT NOTICE WE'VE GOT SOME NEW FURNITURE 
AND A NEW TELLY NOW THE PROBLEM IS 
THERE WAS A FIRE AT OUR STORAGE DEPOT 
YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT IN THE PAPERS 
AND NEARLY ALL OF OUR PROPS WERE DESTROYED 
YEAH AND THE POLICE ARE SAYING AS YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT IT WAS ARSON 
BUT I MEAN WHO'D DO THAT IT'S NOT LIKE WE'VE EVER UPSET ANYONE 
I KNOW 
WELL THERE WAS THE VICAR 
WHOSE TREE WE RAMMED IN THE TOYOTA PICKUP TRUCK 
AND EVERYONE IN WALES 
AND EVERYONE IN BIRMINGHAM AND EVERYONE IN AMERICA 
YEAH AND WHILE WE WERE MAKING THIS SERIES 
WE MANAGED TO UPSET THE COAST GUARD 
WHO SAID WE WERE RUINING THE ENGLISH CHANNEL 
HANG ON A MINUTE WHAT 
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUSLY SUGGESTING THAT THE BRITISH COAST GUARD 
DROVE ALL THE WAY UP TO WATFORD AND SET FIRE TO OUR CHAIRS ARE YOU 
NO I'M NOT I KNOW WHO DID THIS 
WHO 
FIFTH GEAR 
HANG ON WHY 
CAN WE JUST LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE 
JUST LAST WEEK IT WAS IN THE PAPERS 
THEY'VE ROLLED A BEDFORD RASCAL VAN THERE IT IS 
A YEAR AGO IF WE LOOK AT A SHOT FROM TOP GEAR 
WE ROLLED A BEDFORD RASCAL VAN 
THEY'RE NOW SAYING ONE OF THEIR PRESENTERS HAS HURT HIS FOOT 
THAT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT 
WE HAVE PROPER ACCIDENTS ON THIS SHOW 
DO YOU THINK THEY'RE A BIT JEALOUS 
YEAH SO PLEASE REALLY 
TIFF VICKI STOP BURNING OUR THINGS 
YES 
CAN I JUST SAY THE SEATS WE USED TO HAVE WERE FROM A VAUXHALL SENATOR 
IF ANYBODY OUT THERE IS WATCHING 
HANG ON YOU'RE GONNA SAY 
IF YOU'VE GOT A VAUXHALL SENATOR AND YOU DON'T NEED THE SEATS 
WRITE TO US AT 
I'VE GOT A VAUXHALL SENATOR AND I DRIVE EVERYWHERE STANDING UP 
B. B. C. TELEVISION LONDON WHEREVER WE ARE 
IT'S WORTH A SHOT 
I LOVE THE WAY JAMES HAS GONE INTO THAT CHAIR AS THOUGH HE BELONGS 
DID YOU NOTICE THAT 
HE'S JUST GOING THIS IS ME 
IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE YOU GET ONE OF THESE WITH ONE OF THESE THEY SHIP THEM TOGETHER AS A PAIR 
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME AS MY FURNITURE AT HOME 
I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH IT 
SHALL WE MOVE ON YES 
THERE'S LOTS OF SUPERCARS AROUND AT THE MOMENT 
SO I THOUGHT WE COULD TAKE A QUICK LOOK 
HERE'S THAT ROUSH FORD G. T. 
AND THEY'VE TURNED THE SUPER CHARGER UP ON THAT 
SO IT'S NOW WHAT SIX HUNDRED TEN INSTEAD OF FIVE FIFTY H. P. 
IT'S GOING TO BE ONE HUNDRED FORTY ONE THOUSAND THEY'RE ONLY MAKING TEN OF THOSE 
MM THAT'S AS FAST AS IT'LL EVER GO 
IN THAT PICTURE 
AND THERE'S THIS THE LAMBORGHINI REVENTON 
THEY'RE ONLY MAKING TWENTY OF THESE IT IS COSTLY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND APIECE 
EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND YES BUT LOOK AT IT 
IT LOOKS LIKE A STEALTH FIGHTER IT'S ALL ANGLES IT'S BEAUTIFUL EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND QUID YEAH 
THERE'S THE BENTLEY BROOKLANDS IT'S A TWO DOOR UM 
WHAT'S THE OTHER ONE CALLED THAT THEY MAKE 
CONTINENTAL AZURE 
MY WE HAVE BEEN OFF FOR A WHILE 
THE ARNAGE IT'S A TWO DOOR VERSION OF THAT 
FIVE THIRTY H. P. TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND PROPER BENTLEY THOUGH 
OLD SCHOOL PROPER COMFORTABLE GOOD FOR YOUR PILES 
IT'S NOT ALL SUPERCARS THERE ARE SOME AFFORDABLE CARS AS WELL 
ER THERE'S ONE 
O. K. NOW THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT 
ANOTHER QUICK LOOK AT THE NEW CARS 
SUBARU IMPREZA S. T. I. A HYPER NUTTER RALLY THING 
HAVEN'T RELEASED MANY FACTS ABOUT IT YET 
PROBABLY GONNA BE THREE HUNDRED H. P. THEREABOUTS TURBO CHARGED ENGINE 
BUT WE'RE PRETTY CONFIDENT IT'S NOT GONNA BE A LOOKER 
NO NO 
BECAUSE WELL HERE'S THE PHOTOGRAPH THEY SENT OUT 
THAT REALLY IS HONESTLY THAT IS THE PHOTOGRAPH THEY SENT OUT 
WE HAVEN'T FAKED THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY SENT US 
CAN YOU SEND US A PICTURE OF YOUR NEW CAR 
YES HERE IT IS 
DOESN'T SUGGEST CONFIDENCE IT'S A PIG WE KNOW IT 
LISTEN YOU KNOW WHEN BRITAIN WAS A SENSIBLE COUNTRY 
IF YOU HAD A BUMP ON THE MOTORWAY 
YOU PULLED OVER ON THE HARD SHOULDER 
EXCHANGED NAMES AND ADDRESSES AND WENT ON YOUR WAY 
NOT ANY MORE IF YOU HAVE A BUMP ON THE MOTORWAY NOW 
YOU KNOW THOSE POLICEMEN WHO AREN'T REALLY POLICEMEN 
THEY COME TO THE SCENE OF THE CRASH AND CLOSE THE MOTORWAY 
HAVE YOU NOTICED I WAS COMING DOWN THE M. FORTY ON WEDNESDAY 
TINY CRASH COUPLE OF BROKEN INDICATOR LENSES 
THEY GOT THERE AND THEY HAD SHUT ALL THREE LANES 
HUGE QUEUE PEOPLE MISSING MEETINGS PEOPLE MISSING FLIGHTS 
JUST SO THAT THEY COULD RUN AROUND PICKING THINGS UP 
IT'S JUST I'VE NEVER SEEN AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT 
I THOUGHT I'LL FIND OUT HOW MANY OTHER MOTORWAYS HAVE BEEN CLOSED I'VE GOT A LIST 
JUST ON THAT ONE DAY THE M. FORTY THE M. ONE THE M. TWENTY FIVE THE M. TWENTY SIX 
THE M. SIXTY SIX AND THE M. FORTY TWO ALL SHUT 
BY THESE WOMBLES 
WE CAN MANAGE WITHOUT YOU YOU DAYGLO 
AH THAT'S WOMBLES 
THAT'S TOUCHING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
HIS FIRST RANT OF THE SERIES 
HAVE YOU GOT MORE NEWS I HAVE BENTLEY HAVE RECALLED SOME CARS 
THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THEIR WHEEL NUTS APPARENTLY 
THEY MIGHT NOT BE FASTENED PROPERLY 
BENTLEY SAY IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL 
IT'S ONLY ONE BATCH OF NUTS AFFECTED 
IT ONLY AFFECTED I'VE GOT IT WRITTEN DOWN THE ARNAGE R. 
AND THE ARNAGE T. 
AND THE ARNAGE R. L. 
AND THE AZURE 
SO BASICALLY PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THE CARS THEY MAKE 
AND IT'S ONLY THOSE BUILT BETWEEN FEBRUARY OH FIVE AND AUGUST LAST YEAR 
THAT'S A YEAR AND A HALF 
MY FAVOURITE IS THE GOVERNMENT WHO ACTUALLY RUN THIS RECALL 
THEY SAY HERE IF THE BOLTS DO BECOME LOOSE 
THIS WOULD IN ALL PROBABILITY BE NOTICEABLE TO THE DRIVER 
YES IT WOULD 
BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE A CONSIDERABLE MECHANICAL KNOCKING NOISE 
WHAT WHEN THE WHEEL COMES OFF 
AND SPARKS AND SKY ROAD SKY ROAD DITCH 
DEAR I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE CAR 
I THINK THEY WERE JEALOUS OF ROLLS ROYCE 
THEY USED TO SAY THAT THE LOUDEST THING IN A ROLLS ROYCE AT ONE HUNDRED M. P. H. IS THE CLOCK 
YEAH SO NOW BENTLEY CAN SAY 
THE LOUDEST THING IN A BENTLEY AT ONE HUNDRED M. P. H. IS THE FRONT NEAR SIDE WHEEL FALLING OFF 
UM NEW HIGHWAY CODE HAS COME ALONG AND IT SAYS THEY ADVISE YOU DON'T SMOKE WHILE BEHIND THE WHEEL 
WHY I MEAN US THREE ALL SMOKE 
IT'S NOTHING TO BE PROUD OF 
THE FACT IS WE ALL DO AND WE DON'T CRASH WELL TWO OF US DON'T 
ACTUALLY I'VE GIVEN UP SMOKING AS WELL 
YOU CAN'T DO TWO THINGS AT ONCE 
I CAN'T 
I CAN MULTI TASK 
YOU CAN MULTI TASK I'VE SEEN YOU PUTTING YOUR MAKE UP ON 
YEAH AND DRIVING 
AND DRIVING I'VE SEEN YOU MULTI TASK WHEN DRIVING 
NO YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT THAT ON THE TELLY 
THAT ISN'T IN THE HIGHWAY CODE 
YEAH THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE THE HIGHWAY CODE THING 
THE ONES WHO SAY IF YOU FEEL TIRED PULL OFF AT THE MOTORWAY SERVICES 
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO 
COS YOU CAN'T WHILST DRIVING 
SORRY PULL OFF 
SO THEY SAY THAT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THEY SAY YOU CAN'T 
THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE GONNA 
ON THE OTHER 
JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN'T DRIVE AND SMOKE DOESN'T MEAN THE REST OF US ARE ALL SPANNERS 
RIDICULOUS IT IS A GOOD POINT THOUGH IT GIVES ME AN IDEA 
WITH OUR TRACK WHY DON'T WE HAVE TRACK DAYS 
BUT INSTEAD OF GETTING CAUGHT UP WITH HOW FAST YOU'RE GOING 
WE JUST LET PEOPLE SMOKE WHILE THEY'RE DRIVING 
OR PUT THEIR MAKE UP ON OR USE THEIR MOBILE PHONE OR EAT A PIE 
YEAH AND SPEED 
ONE HUNDRED YOU COME HERE YOU'RE LATE FOR WORK YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE A CALL 
YOU GO ROUND THE TOP GEAR TEST TRACK 
YOU CAN MAKE THE CALL HAVE A PIE A LITTLE SLICE OF FREEDOM 
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO PULL OFF IN THE SERVICES EXACTLY 
AND THE ONE HUNDRED YOU PAY US WE CAN SPEND ON SEATS AND THAT'S THE NEWS 
RIGHT IT'S TIME FOR A QUESTION 
WHERE IS THE BEST DRIVING ROAD IN THE WORLD 
SOMETHING THAT HAS EVERYTHING 
CHALLENGING BENDS GREAT VIEWS LONG FAST STRAIGHTS THE LOT 
YEP IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE HERE BECAUSE EVERYONE DOES FIVE 
IT WON'T BE HERE COS EVERYONE'S ON DRUGS 
THAT'S ALL JUST FULL OF OX 
AL GORE SAYS THAT'S GONE SO IT WON'T BE DOWN THERE 
FULL OF SPIDERS SIGNPOSTS HERE ARE GIBBERISH 
THEY'RE ALL COMMUNISTS 
CAN'T GO THERE AMERICANS WILL SHOOT YOU 
NO THANK YOU 
ALL RIGHT OBVIOUSLY WE DID DISCUSS THIS AT LENGTH 
AND WE EVENTUALLY DECIDED THE BEST DRIVING ROAD IN THE WORLD 
WAS PROBABLY SOMEWHERE IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE 
SPECIFICALLY AROUND HERE THE ALPS 
THEN WE DECIDED THAT THE BEST THING FOR US TO DO 
WAS TO GO THERE AND SEE IF WE COULD FIND IT 
THIS IS WHERE OUR QUEST BEGAN 
IN THE MOUNTAINS ABOVE MONTE CARLO IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE 
OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T GO LOOKING FOR THE BEST DRIVING ROAD IN THE WORLD 
IN A JAPANESE HATCH BACK OR A PEOPLE CARRIER 
SO WHAT WE DID WAS BRING ALONG A SELECTION OF THE NEW GENERATION OF LIGHTWEIGHT SUPERCARS 
I'VE CHOSEN THIS THE NEW PORSCHE NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN G. T. THREE R. S. 
IN ESSENCE THE G. T. THREE IS A LIGHTER TAUTER VERSION OF THE NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN 
AND THIS THE R. S. IS A LIGHTER TAUTER VERSION OF THE G. T. THREE 
SO THIS IS IN FACT 
THE ULTIMATE VERSION OF THE ULTIMATE VERSION OF THE ULTIMATE VERSION 
OF THE WORLD'S ULTIMATE SUPERCAR 
NO IT ISN'T 
THE ULTIMATE F. PLAN SUPERCAR IS WHAT I'VE BROUGHT ALONG 
IT'S A LAMBORGHINI GALLARDO SUPERLEGGERA 
AND IT'S LIKE A NORMAL GALLARDO ONLY ONE HUNDRED K. G. LIGHTER 
AND THE V. TEN ENGINE IS A BIT MORE POWERFUL 
THAT IS QUITE A RECIPE 
I SUPPOSE IT IS IF YOU'RE A FAT MIDDLE AGED BLOKE 
WHO WANTS TO BORE EVERYONE ABOUT TRACK DAYS AS YOU'D EXPECT 
I'VE DONE IT PROPERLY AND GOT MYSELF 
A PROPER GENTLEMAN'S RACER THE ASTON MARTIN V. EIGHT VANTAGE N. TWENTY FOUR 
JAMES THAT IS JUST A RACING CAR IT HASN'T GOT ANYTHING IN IT AT ALL NOT EVEN A PASSENGER SEAT 
THIS ISN'T JUST A ROAD CAR PORSCHE 
WITH A BIT OF SCAFFOLDING IN THE BACK 
IT'S TWO FIFTY K. G. LIGHTER THAN THE STANDARD CAR 
THAT'S THE WEIGHT OF A BIG MOTORCYCLE 
SO YOU'VE GOT NO RADIO NO 
NO CARPETS NO 
NO AIR CONDITIONING NO 
JAMES YOU HAVE GOT A CAR WITH NO AIR CONDITIONING IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER 
IT'S BETTER THAN THAT HIS WINDOWS DON'T OPEN 
YES THEY DO ACTUALLY THAT'S A CAT FLAP 
YOU'VE BOTH DONE THE SAME THING 
STANDARD ROAD CARS DRESSED WITH THE TINSEL OF FAKE HIGH PERFORMANCE 
HAS IT GOT AIR CONDITIONING YES IT HAS 
HAVE YOU OH YEAH 
SHALL WE GO YEAH SHALL WE GO IT'S GETTING A BIT MUGGY 
ENGINES START 
RIGHT MASTER SWITCH ON 
HOO HOO HOO 
ER IGNITION SWITCH ON ER 
FAFFING AROUND 
FUEL RESET 
PUMPS ARE RESET 
FAN IS OFF 
NEUTRAL 
ENGINE START 
YES EXCELLENT STRAPPING IN 
ER THAT ONE MUST GO IN THERE 
ER 
OH GOD 
BELIEVE ME NATALIE BY THE KILLERS 
I'VE DONE THREE MINUTES AND I ALREADY ADORE THIS CAR 
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN 
EVENTUALLY JAMES CAUGHT US UP 
SO WE TURNED OFF THE MOTORWAY AND BEGAN OUR SEARCH FOR DRIVING HEAVEN 
IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG 
WE FOUND SOMETHING CALLED THE COL DE TURINI 
A RIBBON OF TARMAC THAT DOESN'T REALLY GO ANYWHERE 
SO IT WAS QUIET 
TILL WE ARRIVED 
ENGINES HUM 
THIS LOOKED LIKE THE IDEAL PLACE TO UNLEASH OUR CARS A LITTLE BIT 
LAMBORGHINI HAVE USED THEIR NOUS WITH THIS CAR 
THEY HAVEN'T JUST LOBBED AWAY ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT NEED 
IT'S GOT A THINNER PROP SHAFT MORE DELICATE DRIVE SHAFTS 
THE ENGINE COVER IS MADE FROM PLASTIC NOT GLASS 
EVEN THE WHEEL NUTS ARE MADE FROM TITANIUM 
ALL OF THESE LITTLE THINGS ADD UP TO ONE HUNDRED K. G. 
THEY WERE GOING TO DITCH THE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE SYSTEM 
TO SAVE ANOTHER FIFTY K. G. BUT TODAY HERE NOW ON THIS ROAD 
I'M GLAD THEY DIDN'T 
I WAS LOVING THE LAMBORGHINI 
BUT IF ANYTHING RICHARD WAS LOVING HIS BEETLE EVEN MORE 
THERE IS SOMETHING FANTASTICALLY PURPOSEFUL ABOUT THIS CAR 
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN FLASH MESSED ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE IT LOOK PRETTY 
THEY'VE JUST TAKEN OFF WHAT THEY CAN TAKE OFF MADE LIGHTER WHAT THEY CAN MAKE LIGHTER 
AND AWAY WE GO 
THIS THING REVS HIGHER THAN THE STANDARD CAR AS WELL 
SO YOU CAN JUST KEEP ON GOING 
THEY'RE SO SMUG ABOUT THEIR NANCY BOY VERSIONS OF LIGHTWEIGHT CARS 
WHEN YOU DRIVE A REALLY REALLY STRIPPED OUT CAR LIKE THIS 
YOU'RE PUT BACK IN TOUCH WITH WHAT DRIVING IS ALL ABOUT 
YOU CAN HEAR ALL THE MACHINERY WORKING 
AND YOU CAN FEEL WHAT IT DOES 
AND I WAS GLAD I DIDN'T HAVE AIR CONDITIONING 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER PICKED UP AN AIR CONDITIONING PUMP 
BUT IT IS VERY HEAVY 
AND IT SAPS SOME OF THE POWER OF THE ENGINE 
I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO EXPLAIN WHY A LIGHTWEIGHT CAR IS A GOOD IDEA 
THE PROBLEM IS MODERN CARS ARE VERY HEAVY 
THEY'VE GOT ALL SORTS OF SAFETY EQUIPMENT ON THEM AIRBAGS ETC 
WE DEMAND LUXURIES LIKE SATELLITE NAVIGATION 
AND ALL THIS WEIGHT SPOILS THE ACCELERATION 
RUINS THE FUEL CONSUMPTION UPSETS THE HANDLING 
AND GETTING RID OF IT MAKES EVERYTHING BETTER 
WOW LOOK AT THIS NOW LOOK AT THIS BIT 
THIS ROAD IS USED AS A SPECIAL STAGE ON THE MONTE CARLO RALLY 
IT'S BUSY IT'S TWISTY IT'S GOT LOW WALLS THAT YOU CAN GO OVER 
HUGE DROPS THAT CAN KILL YOU WITH EASE 
MEANWHILE IN THE ASTON 
I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT JAMES THOUGH I JUST CARED ABOUT THIS AMAZING ROAD 
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT STRINGING TOGETHER A LOAD OF HAIR PINS 
WHAT A ROAD I MEAN WHAT A ROAD 
HONESTLY IT'S 
THIS METALLIC RATTLE 
I KEEP BELTING MY ELBOW ON SOMETHING REALLY REALLY HARD 
AH SHUT UP 
RICHARD AND I WERE NOW SO FAR AHEAD OF CAPTAIN SLOW 
WE DECIDED TO PULL OVER 
HOW'S YOUR BEETLE 
FINE THANK YOU 
HOW'S YOUR AUDI VERY FUNNY VERY FUNNY IN THERE YEAH 
THE HARDER I DROVE TO CATCH UP THE MORE UNBEARABLE THE NOISE BECAME 
YOUR PORSCHE O. K. IS FIFTEEN THOUSAND MORE 
THAN A G. T. THREE THAN A NORMAL G. T. THREE COS IT'S GOT FEWER PARTS 
IT'S LIGHTER IT STANDS TO REASON THE FEWER PARTS THE MORE EXPENSIVE IT BECOMES 
UNTIL YOU GET SOMEONE WITH NO PORSCHE AT ALL WHO'S CHARGED A MILLION POUNDS 
OH NO LOOK HOW MUCH IS YOURS 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
HOW MUCH MORE IS IT THAN AN ORDINARY ONE 
THAT'S A PRETTY FLOWER HOW MUCH MORE IS IT COME ON 
TWENTY SIX THOUSAND 
TWENTY SIX GRAND WELL THERE YOU GO FOR WHAT 
OOSH HERE HE COMES FINALLY 
OH MY TESTICLES 
THAT IS UNBELIEVABLY GOOD 
OH YEAH WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT THAT ROAD 
YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR CAR JAMES 
NO I THOUGHT WE WERE HERE TO FIND A GOOD ROAD 
YOU DON'T LIKE IT IT'S EXCELLENT 
YOU KNOW YOU'VE MADE A MISTAKE IT'S FANTASTIC 
I THINK THAT ROAD'S A BENCHMARK A GOOD STARTING POINT NOW WE SHOULD GO AND FIND ANOTHER BETTER ONE 
YEAH WE'VE GOT STUFF TO COMPARE IT TO ITALY NO SWITZERLAND 
WHAT ABOUT AUSTRIA 
HE JUST WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE WAR YOU'LL GET ALL MAUDLIN 
NO NO I THINK AUSTRIA IS UNDER RATED IT'S GOT SMOOTH ROA DS 
WE'VE NEVER BEEN THERE TOGETHER IT'S THE SMOOTH ROADS 
BECAUSE HIS SUSPENSION'S SO HARD ITALY'S GOT REALLY BUMPY ROADS 
WE SHOULD PROBABLY LOOK AT ITALY 
A LITTLE BEEP TELLING ME I'VE USED A TANK OF FUEL ALREADY 
THAT'S NOT GOOD 
I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING TO GET THE SEAT HIGHER THIS IS RIDICULOUS 
I'M LIKE AN EIGHTY FIVE YEAR OLD MAN 
I WAS OUT OF JUICE 
HELLO 
AND ALTHOUGH THE CAMERA CREW HAD MORE 
I COULDN'T GET IT FROM THEIR CANS INTO THE CAR 
WHOA DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED 
AUDI WHO OF COURSE OWN LAMBORGHINI THEY'VE BUILT ALL OF THE CAR 
AND JUST LET THE ITALIANS TO KEEP THEM HAPPY DO ONE THING 
HI OH DEAR 
NICE VIEW HERE JUST THOUGHT YOU'D STOP AND ADMIRE IT 
YEAH I MIGHT NEED YOUR HELP 
WHY THERE MIGHT BE A PROBLEM 
WHAT FUEL FILLER CAP WON'T OPEN 
NEVER MIND 
SEE YOU IN ITALY 
REVS 
I BROKE OUT THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL WHICH WAS ALL IN ITALIAN 
WE ARE USELESS ITALIANS AND WE HAVEN'T BUILT THIS PROPERLY 
OH 
YES 
ONCE WE'D RE GROUPED WE JOINED THE MOTORWAY ALONG THE ITALIAN RIVIERA 
BY NO MEANS WAS THIS A GREAT DRIVING ROAD 
BUT THERE WERE SOME CONSOLATIONS 
IT'S A SYMPHONY IS WHAT IT IS THE BIG V. TEN IN THIS 
THE FLAT SIX OF HAMMOND'S PORSCHE 
THEN THAT BRUTAL V. EIGHT IN THE RACING CAR 
THE TROUBLE WITH TUNNEL BLASTING IN A CAR WITH ATOMIC POWER LIKE THE LAMBO 
IS THAT THE FUEL ECONOMY DOES DROP A BIT 
I WAS DOING NINE M. P. G. 
OH DEAR IS THIS YOUR SECOND FILL UP 
YES 
MINE'S GOT A ONE HUNDRED TEN LITRE ENDURANCE FUEL TANK 
YOU TWO NEED TO GET IN MY SLIPSTREAM 
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH POWER 
AT NO POINT HAVE I LACKED IN POWER TO KEEP UP 
HOW MANY HORSE POWER 
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO IT'S HOW IT USES IT IT'S HOW IT DEPLOYS THEM 
I'M WITH HAMMOND TOP SPEED 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE TOP SPEED ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE ISH 
ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE YOU'RE NOT IN THE SAME LEAGUE 
THIS IS PROBABLY QUITE A GOOD CAR 
BUT IT'S HALF HEARTED AND LIMP WRISTED 
IT'S NOT A REAL LUXURY SUPERCAR AND NEITHER IS IT A REAL LIGHTWEIGHT 
JAMES A LITTLE COMPROMISE MIGHT BE USEFUL IN YOUR CAR BE HONEST 
NO I LOVE IT 
IN FACT HE LOVED IT SO MUCH HE BOUGHT IT A PRESENT 
WHAT'S THAT I'VE BOUGHT A CUSHION 
ARE YOU ADMITTING THAT IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE NO NO YEAH NO NO NO NO 
HOLD ON HE'S ADMITTING HIS CAR IS UNCOMFORTABLE 
LET ME GUESS THAT'S INTERIOR DESIGN A SCATTER CUSHION TO LOOK PRETTY 
SO MUCH NICER 
MY POOR BUTTOCKS 
YEAH BUT WOULD THE WEIGHT OF THAT CUSHION BE A PROBLEM 
IF HAMMOND AND I SUDDENLY DECIDED THAT WE WERE EIGHT YEARS OLD 
PEDAL ON THE RIGHT 
HA HA THE LAMBO AND THE PORSCHE ARE VERY VERY CLOSE 
THE ASTON MARTIN SEEMS TO BE VERY VERY SLOW 
DIDN'T EXPECT THAT IN THE RACING CAR 
WE WERE HEADING FOR THE ITALIAN LAKES 
BUT IT WAS TIME TO STOP FOR THE NIGHT 
AND SINCE I'D INSISTED ON COMING TO ITALY I'D BOOKED THE HOTEL 
THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A VERY GOOD TOWN 
THEY'RE GOING TO SHOUT AT ME 
TELL ME WE'VE STOPPED HERE TO STEAL SOME WHEELS OR SOMETHING 
WELL IT COULD BE WORSE HOW COULD THIS BE WORSE 
IS THAT THE MOTORWAY 
OH JEREMY I ALWAYS WANTED TO STAY IN THE ITALIAN LAKES 
WE'RE STAYING HERE TONIGHT WELL YES 
SO WE'RE CARRYING ON BY BICYCLE TOMORROW THESE WILL HAVE BEEN STOLEN OBVIOUSLY 
THEY DID SAY THEY HAD A SECURE CAR PARK THAT NOBODY COULD BREAK INTO 
AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT ANYBODY 
COULD POSSIBLY GET INTO THIS CAR PARK IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM 
IT'S VERY SIMPLE WHAT WERE YOU THINKING 
DO YOU KNOW MY CAR DOESN'T HAVE A KEY OR A LOCK 
DOES THAT SAVE WEIGHT 
I KNOW I'M SORRY 
SORRY 
THAT HOTEL HAD NO BAR NO RESTAURANT 
NO AIR CONDITIONING IN THE ROOMS NO 
IT WAS LIKE BEING IN HIS CAR 
WHICH IS WHY WE LEFT THE CREW BEHIND 
AND US THREE ALL WENT NEARER TO THE LAKES TO FIND ANOTHER HOTEL 
AND THE LAKES ARE TO THE NORTH YES AND WHICH WAY DID YOU TAKE US 
NORTH EAST 
YES YOU MADE US DRIVE TWO HUNDRED K. M. IN THE WRONG DIRECTION 
I DID THAT I DID DO THAT BUT WE FOUND A HOTEL IN THE END 
AND ALL WAS WELL YOU RUINED OUR HOLIDAY 
I DID AND I'M VERY SORRY 
WE MUST NOW MOVE ON BECAUSE IT'S TIME TO MEET OUR GUEST 
NOW THE STAR IN A REASONABLY PRICED CAR TONIGHT ONCE SAID 
THAT SHE AND HER HUSBAND 
SET THEIR ALARM CLOCK AN HOUR EARLY EVERY MORNING 
SO THEY HAD CHANCE TO MAKE LOVE BEFORE GOING TO WORK 
MUCH LIKE JAMES MAY ALTHOUGH HE LIVES ALONE 
ERM 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN STAR OF EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS 
DAME HELEN MIRREN 
I CAN REST NOW 
HAVE A SEAT

I KNOW EVERYBODY TALKS TO YOU ABOUT THE QUEEN PRIME SUSPECT AS WELL MM H. M. M. 
BUT YOU WERE IN THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY YES I WAS

YOU'VE GOT A HOUSE MY HUSBAND'S AMERICAN SO WE SPEND TIME THERE 
IS IT IN THAT CAR CULTURE YOU KNOW

I'D HAVE THOUGHT YOU'D LOVE IT COS PEOPLE LIVE IN THEIR CARS 
AND THEY DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR CARS 
YOUR AUTOBIOGRAPHY I'VE READ IT AND LIKED IT NO REALLY 
I HAVE I WENT A BIT WHITE WHEN YOU SAY THAT WHEN YOU WERE LIVING IN PARSONS GREEN 
THIS IS IN FULHAM IN SOUTH WEST LONDON 
ABSOLUTELY YEAH YOU YOU BECAME DISILLUSIONED WITH BRITISH SOCIETY 
BECAUSE OF ALL THE YOUNG HOORAYS LIVING ROUND THERE 
THROWING BREAD ROLLS YES 
THAT WAS ME I DID LIVE IN PARSONS GREEN YOU DIDN'T I DID AND DID YOU THROW FOOD YES 
I USED TO ORDER IT FOR ITS AERO DYNAMIC EFFICIENCY 
YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE GHASTLY GHASTLY GUYS 
THAT DROVE ME OUT OF ENGLAND 
DIDN'T YOU ALSO SAY SOMEWHERE THAT I REMIND YOU OF PARIS HILTON 
YES I SAID YOU WERE LIKE PARIS HILTON YES I DID 
I WAKE UP EVERY MORNING AND GO PARIS 
OH NO I'M NOT THE THING IS YOU ARE UBER MALE 
PARIS IS UBER FEMALE 
I THINK THAT YOU'RE THE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN 
I DON'T PUT PICTURES OF MYSELF NAKED ON THE INTERNET 
MAYBE I'LL GIVE IT A WHIRL 
NEITHER DID SHE TO HER CREDIT IF SOMEONE ELSE DID IT 
HERE'S A TIP PARIS IF YOU'RE WATCHING 
HAVE SEX WITHOUT A CAMERA 
LET'S MOVE ON TO MOTORING IF WE MAY 
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA AGREE ON MUCH HERE 
YOU'RE NOT REALLY A BIG CAR FAN NO MY FIRST CAR WAS A DISASTER 
IT WAS AN M. G. MIDGET THOSE LITTLE WHITE THINGS MY BROTHER SOLD IT TO ME 
THE ENGINE BLEW UP WITHIN TWO DAYS 
DIDN'T YOU HAVE A GOLF G. T. I. ERM YES I DID 
I DID THAT CAME TO A STICKY END MY POOR OLD GOLF G. T. I. 
WHY WHAT HAPPENED I WAS DOING THEATRE AT THE OLD VIC NO THE YOUNG VIC IN WATERLOO 
AND I'D JUST CLEARED OUT MY CLOSET AND I HAD ALL THIS STUFF 
TO TAKE TO THE CHARITY SHOP AND THEN I THOUGHT 
THERE WERE NO CHARITY SHOPS I DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME 
AND I KNEW EVERYONE SAID KEEP YOUR CAR LOCKED AROUND HERE 
BECAUSE THINGS GET NICKED OUT OF THE CAR 
SO I THOUGHT PERFECT I'LL LEAVE MY STUFF IN THE CAR 
I'LL LEAVE THE CAR OPEN AND IT'LL ALL GET NICKED 
INSTEAD OF THE STUFF GETTING NICKED MY CAR GOT TORCHED 
NO I CAME OUT AND IT WAS LIKE THIS HULK 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT NOW I DON'T HAVE A CAR NOW 
HAVE YOU GOT AN OYSTER CARD YES I DO YEP WHAT IS ONE 
IT'S A BRILLIANT THING IT'S THIS LITTLE THING 
AND WHEN YOU GO ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
WHICH ARE LIKE BUSES AND TUBES AND TRAINS 
YOU HAVE THIS LITTLE CARD AND YOU SWIPE IT AND YOU'RE ON 
WHY WOULDN'T YOU GO IN A CAR THOUGH 
THERE'S A CHAUFFEUR DRIVING THE BUS IN A UNIFORM 
AND THE TRAMP SITTING NEXT TO YOU VOMITING ON YOU 
LET'S TALK ABOUT SUPERCARS IF I MAY WHAT'S A SUPERCAR 
FERRARIS LAMBORGHINIS WHERE ARE YOU ON THOSE 
I THINK I. I JUST THINK MOST GUYS WHO DRIVE 
WHEN I SEE THEM I GO OH DICKHEAD YOU KNOW 
OH SORRY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SAID PILLOCK 
PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT RICHARD HAMMOND'S GOT ONE 
OH HE HASN'T HAS HE NO HE HAS 
HE'S NOT A PILLOCK HE'S A NICE GUY SO I'M SORRY RICHARD IS HE 
YES I THOUGHT HE WAS A PILLOCK 
SO O. K. THE LAP OBVIOUSLY 
FUN IT WAS I DON'T KNOW IF FUN IS THE RIGHT WORD 
IT WAS TERRIFYING IT WAS NERVE WRACKING 
IT WAS ADRENALINE PUMPING 
MY HANDS WERE SHAKING LIKE THIS AT THE END 
IT WAS SWEAT MAKING IT WAS IT WAS FABULOUS 
YOU DID LIKE IT THEN IT WAS FABULOUS I WAS THINKING 
SHALL WE HAVE A LOOK AT IT YEAH 
SORRY ABOUT THE T. V. BUT HERE WE GO 
IT'S LIKE BEING IN THE SIXTIES 
THAT'S AN AGGRESSIVE START LATER HARD HOLD 
LATER HARD ARE YOU DOING THE SHIPPING FORECAST 
DOUGLAS DOGGER HARD 
LATER HARD FAROE WHAT IS THAT 
IS THAT WHAT THE STIG TOLD YOU TO DO HE DID 
DID HE TELL YOU TO DO THAT SLOWER HARDER SLOW INTO THE CORNERS 
AND THEN FAST OUT IT'S SLOW NOW GO 
NO YOU IDIOT 
MY LANGUAGE WAS A LOT BLUER THAN THAT OH YES 
HERE WE GO NOW WE'RE COMING UP TO 
IT'S SUCH A SILLY LOOKING LITTLE CAR 
DID YOU LIKE IT NO IT'S AWFUL ISN'T IT 
OH YES 
I LIKED THAT BIT THERE YOU'RE CUTTING THE CORNER THERE PICKING UP SPEED 
THAT'S THE WRONG GEAR 
IS IT IS THAT FOURTH IT WAS THIRD IT WAS GOING RRR RRR 
YEAH SHE'S REALLY PICKING UP SPEED NOW 
THIS IS MICHAEL GAMBON'S CORNER WHERE WE NEARLY LOST HIM 
AND ROUND THERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
ACROSS THE LINE 
SO 
MIRACULOUSLY UNDAMAGED IN THE FIRE 
IS OUR BOARD YOU HAD A FIRE 
CHANNEL FIVE SET FIRE TO EVERYTHING WE OWN 
HONESTLY THEY DID THAT'S WHY WE'RE ON RUBBISH FURNITURE BUT ANYWAY 
THIS SURVIVED AND WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'VE COME THERE 
IF THIS IS THE THESPIAN ZONE YES 
AM I IN THE THESPIAN ZONE YES 
RAY WINSTONE KRISTIN SCOTT THOMAS 
RICK WAKEMAN IS NOT A THESP HE IS ACTUALLY 
THEN BRIAN COX AND JIMMY CARR WHO'S A COMEDIAN I HAVE NO IDEA 
READY YES ONE 
FIFTY OH NO 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN OH 
ONE POINT EIGHT WHICH PUTS YOU NOT BAD 
SO HOW MANY OSCARS HAVE YOU WON ONE ONE OSCAR 
EMMYS FOUR GOLDEN GLOBES THREE I THINK 
AND NOW IT TURNS OUT YOU'RE FASTER ROUND OUR TRACK THAN RICK WAKEMAN 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN DAME HELEN MIRREN THANK YOU 
RIGHT NOW NOW IT IS TIME 
IT IS TIME TO DO THE COOL WALL 
UNFORTUNATELY UNFORTUNATELY 
THE COOL WALL WAS ONE OF THE MAJOR CASUALTIES 
IN OUR FIRE BUT WE WILL PERSEVERE 
YES WE WILL AND WE'RE GONNA KICK OFF WITH THIS 
YES 
IT'S IS IT A GOLF NO THAT'S MORE AN ALFA 
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE HEADLAMP IT'S AN ALFA WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT IS 
IT'S AN AUDI 
HOW EMPTY IS YOUR LIFE 
THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THIS IS AN AUDI FROM THAT PHOTOGRAPH 
THIS ISN'T WORKING 
I MEAN EVEN IF WE COULD PUT THEM UP 
IT WON'T BE MUCH OF A. IT'S RUINED 
THE COOL WALL'S RUINED SORRY 
WHEN VICKI BUTLER HENDERSON BURNED THE COOL WALL 
YEAH SHE THOUGHT SHE'D FLUMMOXED US 
IT DOESN'T MATTER COS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT ISN'T 
JAMES MAY HASN'T BEEN BURNED HURRAH FOR THAT 
NO ACTUALLY I'M FINE 
LET'S GET BACK TO TONIGHT'S BIG FILM 
IN WHICH THE THREE OF US ARE ATTEMPTING TO FIND THE BEST DRIVING ROAD IN THE WORLD 
IN THESE THREE LIGHTWEIGHT SUPERCARS 
WE CAN'T AGREE WHICH ONE IS THE BEST 
ONLY THAT HIS ASTON IS JUST AWFUL 
TO BE HONEST WE COULDN'T EVEN AGREE ON WHERE WE WANTED TO GO 
I WANTED AUSTRIA HE WANTED SWITZERLAND BUT WHEN WE LEFT THE ACTION 
WE WERE DRIVING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF BORING MOTORWAY MILES 
BECAUSE JEREMY SAID THE ITALIAN LAKES WOULD BE BRILLIANT 
LOOK AT IT LAKE MAGGIORE IS JUST FANTASTIC 
AS FOR THE ROADS 
I SAT FOR A DAY ON A MOTORWAY IN AN OVEN ESSENTIALLY 
FOR THIS THIS ROAD IS RUBBISH 
THE TRAFFIC COUPLED WITH THE HOTEL FIASCO THE NIGHT BEFORE 
HAD PUT THE CHAPS IN QUITE A BAD MOOD 
WE'VE COME ALL THE WAY HERE IN THESE CARS AND YOU IT UP BECAUSE YOU'RE A 
FEEBLE MINDED I THINK THE USELESS 
LOOK AT THE COLOUR OF THAT WATER IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
WHY DID YOU THINK THIS WOULD BE GOOD YOU BIG DAFT 
TRUST ME ITALY IS THE PLACE SHUT UP IT'S THE HOME OF THE FAST CAR 
WE SHOULD HAVE JUST COME HERE ON A BUS 
THERE IS A SPEED BUMP ON THE ROAD 
OH THAT'S THE FINAL STRAW 
I'M EXPLORING THE LIMITS OF GRIP HERE 
HE'S BROUGHT US UP SOMEBODY'S DRIVEWAY 
REALISING THAT I'D MUCKED THINGS UP A BIT 
I SUGGESTED WE TRY THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE 
WHICH MEANT CATCHING A FERRY 
WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST DRIVING FOREST 
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO SWITZERLAND BECAUSE 
SWITZERLAND IS 
MOORS MOORS DO YOU WANT TO WASH YOUR CAR 
WHEN YOU GET THERE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BY LAW 
UP THE BRAKE HORSEPOWER NOT ALLOWED A TINY BIT OF SPEEDING PRISON 
TRUST ME SWITZERLAND IS THE WRONG COUNTRY 
AUSTRIA 
EVENTUALLY WE ARRIVED AT THE OTHER SIDE 
SO THAT I CAN GET THE AIR CONDITIONING ON 
SEVENTEEN DEGREES I'M GOING TO HAVE IT ABOUT THAT YES 
YEAH I'M GOING TO HAVE SEVENTEEN IT'S HALF TWELVE NOW IT'S GETTING HOT 
OH NO 
OH 
IN ORDER FOR THE FERRY TO UNLOAD JAMES HAD TO DISEMBARK FIRST 
HANG ON A MINUTE BLOKES SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT 
WHAT'S THE MATTER IT'S BROKEN DUNNO 
HAS IT GOT FUEL IN IT YEAH LOADS OF FUEL 
DESPITE THE HORNS JAMES WOULDN'T RUSH HIS PRE FLIGHT CHECKS 
MASTER SWITCH IGNITION PUMP THAT'S OFF 
VERY VERY FAST 
AT LEAST IT'S LIGHT 
JEREMY WE'RE KEEPING EVERYBODY ON THE BOAT NOW 
THE LADY SHOUTED 
SORRY SCUSI 
SORRY SORRY 
I CAN'T GET THROUGH THERE BACK UP 
YOUR COUNTRY MAKES SUPERCARS YOU CAN'T HONK WHEN SOMEBODY BUYS ONE 
THAT IS THE CORRECT POSITION BECAUSE THAT'S ON AND THE PANEL IS ON THE IGNITION IS DOWN 
DO YOU WANT TO GET THAT 
HA HA AH AH AH 
THAT'S THE HOTTEST THING IN THE WORLD BUGGER 
THE FUEL 
WITH THE IDIOT'S CAR NOW WORKING 
WE FOUND THE ROAD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE WAS A BORING DUEL CARRIAGEWAY 
STILL THERE WAS ONE GOOD THING 
WE WERE HEADING NORTH TO WHERE I'D WANTED TO GO IN THE FIRST PLACE 
SWITZERLAND 
PLEASE LET'S FIND SOMETHING GOOD 
WE DID 
THIS IS THE SAN BERNARDINO PASS 
WOW 
I THINK A BOOT FULL WOULD BE APPROPRIATE YEP 
THE SWISS WILL LOOK ON THESE THREE CARS AS THOUGH THE ANTI CHRIST 
HAS COME TO THEIR LITTLE WORLD 
BUT I DIDN'T CARE 
THE HILLS ARE ALIVE TO THE SOUND OF HORSEPOWER 
MEANWHILE IN THE ASTON 
THE SAN BERNARDINO PASS WAS SOMETHING ELSE 
THE VIEWS THE SMOOTHNESS OF THE ROAD SURFACE THE ELEGANCE OF THE ROAD ITSELF 
BUT RICHARD WASN'T FINISHED AND INSISTED WE KEPT HEADING NORTH 
I WONDER WHERE HE'S TAKING US 
WOW LIECHTENSTEIN 
LIECHTENSTEIN MAKES MORE FALSE TEETH HERE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD 
WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY HAMMOND HAS BROUGHT US HERE 
I HOPE IT CONTAINS A BRILLIANT ROAD AND I'VE A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THIS PLACE 
YOU SEE WE WANT BENDS THAT STRETCH LOOKS 
LIECHTENSTEIN WAS THE LAST COUNTRY IN EUROPE TO GIVE WOMEN THE VOTE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR 
THAT IS IN LIECHTENSTEIN IF THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF LIECHTENSTEIN 
WENT TO THE MILLENNIUM STADIUM IN CARDIFF THERE'D BE THIRTY NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EMPTY SEATS 
YEAH BUT BACK TO THE ROAD IF WE CARRY ON UP HERE THIS BIT WIGGLES LOOK AT THOSE TURNS 
YOU KNOW THIS IS A TAX HAVEN IT'S GOT MORE COMPANIES HERE THAN PEOPLE 
THAT IS A KILLER STRETCH OF ROAD SHALL WE TRY EACH OTHER'S CARS FOR THIS BIT 
WHAT WHY DON'T WE TRY EACH OTHER'S CARS NO I REALLY LIKE THIS ONE MATE DO YOU WANT TO GO IN THIS NO 
RIGHT SO THIS THEORETICALLY IS THE START OF THE GREATEST DRIVING ROAD IN THE WORLD 
I FEAR I MAY HAVE MADE A SLIGHT MISTAKE HERE 
HE HAD THERE WAS A CYCLE RACE ON AND HIS BRILLIANT ROAD WAS CLOSED 
WHAT ARE WE ALLOWED TO DRIVE ON IT NO NO IT'S SHUT 
IT IS A BIT YOU'VE DRAGGED ME ALL THE WAY TO LIECHTENSTEIN TO GO ON A ROAD THAT'S SHUT A BIT 
COMPLETELY WHERE DO YOU WANNA GO NOW AUSTRIA 
OH GOD YOU GOT TO AUSTRIA WE CAN'T SMELL YOUR PITS FROM THERE I'M GOING BACK TO ITALY 
RELUCTANTLY THE OTHERS AGREED TO COME WITH ME 
SO WE HEADED BACK THROUGH SWITZERLAND STOPPING OFF FOR THE NIGHT AT THE SKI RESORT OF DAVOS 
IT HAD BEEN A BAD DAY WE HAD BEEN THROUGH THREE COUNTRIES AND ONLY FOUND ONE GOOD BIT OF ROAD 
SO RICHARD AND I DECIDED TO VANDALISE JAMES' ASTON 
HALF OF ME WANTS HIM TO SEE IT HALF OF ME WANTS HIM TO DRIVE ALL DAY WITH IT ON HE'LL NEVER NOTICE 
YOU KNOW WHAT JOE'S LIKE HE DOESN'T NOTICE ANYTHING HE'S NOT COMING 
K. KEVIN THAT SOUNDS LIKE A RACING DRIVER'S NAME 
AND HE'S BOUGHT US A DRINK 
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT 
THE NEXT MORNING WE HEADED SOUTH OUT OF DAVOS 
I COULDN'T QUITE BELIEVE WHAT WE'D STUMBLED ON 
MILE AFTER MILE OF DESERTED PERFECTION 
EVEN JEREMY HAD TO CONCEDE I WAS RIGHT ABOUT SWITZERLAND 
THIS IS ABSOLUTE HEAVEN 
OH HO HO 
AW THIS IS MUCH MORE LIKE IT 
WHAT WAS GOD THINKING OF WHEN HE GAVE THE SWISS THIS PLACE 
PLAINLY IT SHOULD BE OURS 
THIS ROAD WAS A TEST OF BREAKS STEERING GRIP POWER AND HANDLING 
AN IDEAL PLACE THEN TO REFLECT ON THE CARS WE'D BROUGHT ON OUR MOTORING HOLIDAY 
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CAR NOW HAS COME ALIVE IT'S SUDDENLY IN ITS ELEMENT 
THIS THING JUST TRACKS SO PERFECTLY 
MEANWHILE IN THE ASTON 
I WONDER HOW MUCH OF THIS I HAVE TO ENDURE BEFORE I CAN ADMIT 
THAT THIS IS A TERRIBLE CAR AND THAT I HATE IT AND I WANT TO GO HOME 
IT'S ACTUALLY A PHYSICALLY PLEASURABLE SENSATION THAT RUNS UP YOUR ARM WHEN YOU TURN THE WHEEL 
IT'S IT'S UNCANNY 
JEREMY CLARKSON TODAY MARRIED A LAMBORGHINI AND MOVED TO SWITZERLAND 
AND THEN IT HIT ME I WAS IN A LAMBORGHINI IN THE ALPS 
ALL I NEED IS A PAIR OF SUNGLASSES AND SOME MATT MONRO 
OOH NO HANG ON A MINUTE 
WE'D ALL PRETTY MUCH DECIDED THAT WE'D FOUND DRIVING HEAVEN WELL TWO OF US HAD 
BUT THEN AFTER WE POPPED OVER THE BORDER AND BACK INTO ITALY 
WE FOUND A CHERRY FOR THE TOP OF OUR CAKE 
FIFTEEN MILES OF ASPHALT SPAGHETTI DRAPED ON AN A. L. P. 
IT WAS STUNNING 
SHALL WE DO IT 
HERE WE GO 
THE DROPS 
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE 
IF YOU WENT OVER THE EDGE HERE YOU'D HAVE TIME TO PHONE THE INSURERS 
THIS IS A MAGNIFICENT PIECE OF ROAD BUILDING 
NOT LIKE PLAYSTATION THIS YOU CAN'T JUST PRESS THE RESET BUTTON WHEN YOU GET IT WRONG 
YOU JUST GO THROUGH THE PEARLY GATES ON FIRE 
I HATE TO ADMIT THIS BUT THIS ASTON IS STARTING TO MAKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF GOOD SENSE 
EVEN THE BREAKS HAVE STOPPED SQUEAKING CLIMBING UP NOW PAST EIGHT THOUSAND FEET 
I THINK AT THIS ALTITUDE A LAMBO HAS GOT THE ADVANTAGE 
I SHALL SOLVE THAT THOUGH WITH SOME BRAVERY 
THIS IS HARD WORK IF I HAD NO AIR CONDITIONING I'D LOOK RIDICULOUS NOW 
WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY ROAD 
THANK YOU ITALY THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU 
WE FINISHED OUR RUN AND AS THE CARS TICKED THEMSELVES COOL 
WE KNEW THEIR WORK WAS DONE 
OUR QUEST WAS AT AN END 
DAVOS TO STELVIO THE GREATEST DRIVING ROAD IN THE WORLD 
THAT WAS A GOOD HOLIDAY WHAT DO YOU THINK 
SO THERE YOU ARE IF YOU'RE THINKING OF GOING ON HOLIDAY NEXT YEAR FORGET CENTER PARCS JUST GO THERE 
YES NOW THE CARS SO JAMES 
NO JUST NO ON EVERY LEVEL RICHARD 
I THOUGHT THE PORSCHE WAS FANTASTIC I LOVED IT 
BUT THE MAIN PROBLEM IS I STILL DON'T SEE WHY IT'S FIFTEEN GRAND MORE FOR THE R. S. VERSION THAN THE ORDINARY G. T. THREE 
I HAVE TO SAY THE SAME ON THE LAMBO I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD AS MUCH FUN IN A NORMAL ONE 
ALSO IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO A SPECIAL EDITION LAMBORGHINI DON'T TAKE STUFF OFF PUT STUFF ON 
LIKE SPACE THRUSTERS AND MACHINE GUNS THAT'S WHAT LAMBORGHINIS ARE ABOUT 
SO HANG ON WE TOOK THREE CARS ON HOLIDAY AND THEY WERE ALL WRONG YES WE'RE BACK IN BUSINESS 
YEAH TOP GEAR AMBITIOUS BUT RUBBISH THAT'S US 
AND THERE'LL BE MORE OF THAT NEXT WEEK GOOD NIGHT
