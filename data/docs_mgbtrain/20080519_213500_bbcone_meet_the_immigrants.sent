LET'S SEE HOW WE GO 
I THINK THAT IF I WOULD BE LEFT WITHOUT MY WIFE AND MY CHILDREN I WOULD BE A BROKEN DOWN MAN 
MAYBE GO TO A HIGH TOWER AND THROW MYSELF DOWN 
THAT'S HOW BIG IT IS 
THE PRICE OF BEING A EUROPEAN MIGRANT CAN BE HIGH 
I LOVE MY CHILDREN I LOVE MY WIFE AND DON'T WANT TO RISK THAT 
IT'S SOMETHING TOO BEAUTIFUL 
IT'S TOO PRECIOUS TO LOSE 
CATALIN DOBRISAN LEFT HIS FAMILY IN ROMANIA TO WORK AS A TAXI DRIVER IN THE U. K. 
THE PLAN WAS THAT HIS FAMILY SHOULD JOIN HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
BUT NOW HIS WIFE ANNA HAS TOLD CATALIN SHE NEEDS MORE TIME BEFORE MAKING THE MOVE 
MY WIFE HAS SOME THINGS TO DO HERE LIKE DRIVING SCHOOL 
AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH WILL DELAY 
THERE IS STILL A PRESSURE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SETTLED YET 
WE'RE STILL A FAMILY LIVING IN TWO COUNTRIES 
IF SOMEBODY'S SELFISH YES I WILL BE THE SELFISH ONE BECAUSE YES I WANT TO HAVE THEM NEXT TO ME 
IF THERE IS SOMEBODY DOMINATING I AM THE ONE BECAUSE I WANT THEM WITH ME 
THE WAY YOU WANT IT IS VERY SUDDENLY AND WHEN I'M TIED TO SOMETHING 
LIKE MY DRIVING SCHOOL AND YOU AGREED WITH THAT 
YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO JUMP IN A PLANE AND FLY RIGHT NOW IN ENGLAND 
EXACTLY SEE AND I CAN'T DO THAT 
MY WIFE IS HANDLING ALL THE MONEY IN ROMANIA 
AND I DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH EVERYTHING SHE SPENDS THE MONEY ON 
YOU JUST CANNOT SPEND EVERYTHING THAT YOU RECEIVE 
I THINK OF THE FUTURE 
I THINK OF SAVING ENOUGH 
I HAVE TO FURNISH A WHOLE APARTMENT THERE IN ENGLAND 
THE ONLY TROUBLE IS HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND 
THAT I CANNOT MANAGE MONEY IN THIS LITTLE TIME TO LEARN EVERYTHING 
I MANAGE THE MONEY FOR EVERYTHING YEAH BUT SHE DOESN'T WANT ANY HELP EITHER 
NO YOU KNOW HOW HE WANTS TO HELP ME 
BY SENDING ME LESS MONEY YES SO YOU CAN MANAGE WITH THE LESS BUDGET 
HELLO 
WELL IT ALL SEEMS SORTED THEN 
HONESTLY YES TO MY MIND IT'S SORTED 
FROM SENEGAL FROM MY NEIGHBOUR COUNTRY YOU KNOW SENEGAL 
YEAH OH FANTASTIC 
IT REMIND ME OF HOME YOU KNOW 
A BEAUTIFUL MELON ALL THE WAY HERE FROM SENEGAL 
FAMARA CESSAY IS FROM THE GAMBIA IN WEST AFRICA 
I NEED MILK FOR MY CUP OF TEA 
HE CLAIMED ASYLUM IN THE U. K. AFTER A MILITARY COUP 
BUT HIS CLAIM WAS DENIED AND NOW HE'S LIVING ON BORROWED TIME 
NOT FOR ME NOT FOR ME NOT FOR ME 
EACH YEAR ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE REFUSED ASYLUM 
WHILE THEIR FATE IS DECIDED THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WORK 
SO FAMARA SURVIVES ON FOOD VOUCHERS 
I LIKE THIS BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IS THE PRICE 
IF I CAN AFFORD IT 
OH THIS IS ONE POINT NINE NINE 
NO NO NO NO NO 
IF I BUY ONE OF THESE THAT'S IT 
MY MONEY'S GONE SO I HAVE TO GET SOMETHING CHEAPER THAN THAT YOU KNOW 
OH OH OH 
THAT'S THREE POINT TWO OH LOVEY 
THREE POINT TWO OH THAT'S ONE POINT EIGHT OH LOVE 
ONE POINT EIGHT OH THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHEERS 
THANK YOU LOVE THANK YOU DARLING TAKE CARE 
CHEERS OH HO HO 
HE'S PROVIDED WITH A ROOM IN LEEDS SHARING THE HOUSE WITH OTHER ASYLUM SEEKERS 
IF YOU ARE AN ASYLUM SEEKER 
YOU DON'T HAVE NO RESPECT YOU UNDERSTAND 
THE PEOPLE THEY THINK THAT YOU ARE A BEGGAR YOU KNOW 
AFTER YOU THAT PERSON IS THE BOTTOM OF THE PEOPLE IN THE SOCIETY 
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT IS YOU KNOW 
ASYLUM SEEKERS THEY ARE THE BOTTOM OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS SOCIETY HERE 
ANYWHERE YOU GO YOU KNOW THEY SAY OH ASYLUM 
YOU DON'T HAVE NOTHING YOU KNOW 
WE ARE NOT ALIENS WE ARE NOT FROM YOU KNOW FROM THE SKY AND WE COME DOWN HERE YOU KNOW 
WE ARE ALL HUMANS YOU KNOW 
THE ONLY THING THAT CAN REALLY MAKE MY LIFE BETTER IN ENGLAND HERE 
THAT IS WHEN I HAVE A PERMISSION YOU KNOW TO STAY IN ENGLAND HERE 
AND THEY GIVE ME PAPERS TO GO AND WORK 
I CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING IN THIS SOCIETY I'LL FEEL BETTER YOU KNOW 
BUT NOW I FEEL GUILT YOU KNOW 
BECAUSE I THINK I AM DEPENDING ON PEOPLE BIG MAN LIKE ME YOU KNOW 
YOU UNDERSTAND SO IF THEY BRING MY VOUCHERS I FEEL GUILTY 
MOHAMED ELSHAFIE IS ALLOWED TO WORK AS A JUNIOR DOCTOR IN BOSTON LINCOLNSHIRE 
HE CAME FROM SUDAN FOUR YEARS AGO TO COMPLETE HIS MEDICAL TRAINING 
HAVE YOU OPENED YOUR BOWELS TODAY 
YEAH TODAY NORMAL HALF PAST TWELVE TEA TIME 
YOU CAN PLAY THE DRUMS NOW AREN'T YOU LOOK AT THIS HERE IT'S BIG 
I THINK WE NEED AN X. RAY FOR THAT 
YEAH YEAH 
AND WHO LIVES WITH HIM 
I DO YOU DO TAKING CARE OF HIM YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLES WITH THAT 
PLENTY OF TIMES 
HE WILL HAVE AN X. RAY DONE 
FOR HIS STOMACH AND THE BLOODS WILL BE SENT 
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHY HIS STOMACH'S JUST SWOLLEN UP 
I CAN'T I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHY THAT'S HAPPENED 
IT COULD BE FLUID IT COULD BE AIR 
THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE DOCTORS' MESS 
IT'S A SECRET LOCATION IN EVERY HOSPITAL 
DOESN'T HAVE A SIGN AS YOU CAN SEE 
MO IS HERE ON A WORK PERMIT BUT IF HIS CAREER IS TO PROGRESS HE NEEDS TO CHANGE THAT STATUS 
THIS IS AN APPLICATION FORM FOR MY HSMP 
IT'S A HIGHLY SKILLED MIGRANT PROGRAMME VISA 
WHICH CAN GRANT ME THE CHANCE OF APPLYING FOR FURTHER TRAINING JOBS IN THE U. K. 
BECAUSE MY CURRENT VISA'S A WORK PERMIT VISA 
WITH THE NEW REGULATIONS I'M NOT ALLOWED TO APPLY FOR 
FURTHER SPECIALIST TRAINING OR FOR ANY OTHER POSSIBLE TRAINING JOBS UNLESS I HAVE THIS 
I JUST GET MIGRANT PROGRAMME STATUS 
WELL YOU GET POINTS FOR YOUR QUALIFICATION WHICH IS A BACHELOR'S DEGREE A B. S. 
THAT SHOULD GIVE ME THIRTY POINTS 
YOU ARE PROFICIENT IN ENGLISH I HOPE 
YOU CAN SUPPORT YOURSELF WITHOUT CLAIMING BENEFITS I HAVE BEEN 
YOU INTEND TO MAKE THE U. K. YOUR MAIN HOME YES 
IT'S GOING TO CHANGE MY LIFE IF I GET IT AND IF I DON'T IT'S ALSO GOING TO CHANGE MY LIFE 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S FOR THE GOOD OR FOR THE BAD I'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE 
IT'S PART OF HIS BOWEL LARGE BOWEL 
GROSSLY DILATED 
MEANS I'M GOING TO KEEP HIM NIL BY MOUTH 
GIVE HIM SOME FLUIDS 
HE'LL PROBABLY NEED A C. T. SCAN TOMORROW 
CATALIN'S FUTURE IS LOOKING BRIGHTER 
HAVING SPENT TIME WITH HIS FAMILY HE'S HEADING BACK TO PLYMOUTH A HAPPIER MAN 
WHEN HE CAME HOME HE ASKED ME DID YOU SAVE SOME MONEY 
WHAT MONEY TO SAVE 
COS EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE 
MY KIDS NEEDS ALL THE TIME NEW CLOTHES THEY ARE GROWING 
THEY ARE GOING SOMEWHERE WITH THE KINDERGARTEN IN THE PARKS OR THE THEATRE OR SOMEWHERE 
YOU NEED TO PAY FOR IT HE'S JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND HE SENDS MONEY FOR THE FAMILY AND WHEN YOU SEND 
MONEY FOR THE FAMILY YOU DON'T COUNT EVERY SINGLE CENT IT'S YOUR FAMILY 
AT THE MOMENT MY STRUGGLE IS WITH THE FACT THAT I HAVE A LOT OF MONEY COMING IN 
BUT I ALSO HAVE ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY JUST GOING OUT 
IN ORDER FOR MY FAMILY TO COME OVER HERE TO MOVE 
TO HAVE EVERYTHING THEY NEED I WOULD NEED AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND 
RIGHT NOW I HAVE HALF OF IT IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME 
I DON'T PICTURE MY LIFE WITHOUT HIM 
THESE ARE PROBLEMS WHICH CAN BE RESOLVED AND I'M ABLE TO DO ANYTHING TO RESOLVE THEM 
SHE UNDERSTOOD WHAT I EXPECTED I UNDERSTOOD WHAT SHE EXPECTED 
AND OUR RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN QUITE GOOD 
CATALIN HAS A LOT TO ORGANISE BEFORE HIS FAMILY CAN MOVE FROM ROMANIA 
NOT LEAST FINDING A SUITABLE HOME 
SO BATHROOM FITTED KITCHEN LIVING ROOM 
WHICH IS ALL RIGHT 
ALARM 
MY WIFE HAS ALWAYS DREAMED OF LIVING IN A NICE HOUSE 
I WOULD RATHER 
RENT A HOUSE 
THAT'LL BE SOMETHING REALLY 
REALLY NICE 
WHEN I HAVE MY OWN PLACE THEN MY FAMILY WILL BE HERE AS WELL 
I CAN CONCENTRATE ON 
MY WIFE GETTING A JOB 
AND US TO GET BACK INTO HAVING A NORMAL FAMILY LIFE WHERE WE GO TO WORK 
WE COME BACK HOME WE ENJOY A GOOD MEAL AND WE PLAY WITH THE CHILDREN 
AND GO TO A GOOD PARK 
UM I'M MISSING THAT LIFE 
WHEN THIS IS BEING CUT A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE IT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN JUST DOWN THERE SO MEASURE THAT 
WITHOUT A JOB FAMARA HOPES HIS AFRICAN JEWELLERY WILL MAKE HIM SOME CASH 
BACK HOME WHEN WE ARE DOING THESE YOU SIT UNDER THE TREE YOU KNOW 
AND WE PLAY MUSIC SOME PEOPLE THEY ARE PLAYING THE DRUMS 
AND THE TOURISTS THEY ARE COMING IN AND OUT YOU KNOW 
I GOT TOO MUCH HAIR 
THERE ARE THREE THOUSAND DESTITUTE ASYLUM SEEKERS IN LEEDS 
THIS DROP IN CENTRE IS THEIR LIFELINE 
THE MANAGER IS CHRISTINE MAJID 
HI JOSEPH WELCOME 
I'LL JUST EXPLAIN BRIEFLY WHAT HAPPENS HERE 
COS I MIGHT NOT GET A LOT OF TIME WHEN IT GETS BUSY 
WE TRY AND HELP PEOPLE 
THAT HAVE BEEN THEIR ASYLUM CLAIM'S FAILED 
MOST PEOPLE IN HERE DON'T HAVE ANY SUPPORT 
THEY HAVE NO PERMISSION TO WORK NO ACCOMMODATION NO MONEY NOTHING 
SO I THINK THE MAIN THING IS TO SEE PEOPLE EAT WHEN THEY COME HERE 
COS YOU KNOW THEY'VE NO MONEY TO BUY FOOD 
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD ONE SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE 
MM VERY NICE 
THEY OFFER ADVICE TO PEOPLE ON WELFARE AND ASYLUM ISSUES 
SO WAS YOUR FRESH CLAIM REFUSED YES IT WAS 
IT'S VERY VERY VERY HELPFUL FOR EVERYBODY BECAUSE CHRISTINE 
IS SUCH A NICE WOMAN YOU KNOW SHE'S OPEN FOR EVERYBODY 
YEAH IT'S FIVE 
FOR YOU TWO 
SEXY DOLL 
SEXY BABY 
SEXY BABY WANT THIS ONE 
VOILA 
SEXY BABY 
UH NICE THIS 
UH YOU LIKE IT TELL MUMMY TWO 
ANOTHER ONE THAT'S NICE 
NO SHE SHE WOULD LOSE IT AGAIN 
AH DO YOU WANT IT 
SHE'S GOT MY MONEY HELLO 
SHE PUT ALL MY MONEY IN HER POCKET 
VERY SMALL PROBABLY DENSE HYPER DENSE 
MO'S STATUS MAY BE TEMPORARY BUT HE CARRIES ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY 
HELLO GOOD MORNING HELLO 
O. K. I'LL TELL YOU I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU 
YEAH IT'S IT'S NOT THE BEST NEWS BUT IT'S GOOD IN WAYS 
YOU REMEMBER WE DID THIS MAMMOGRAM FIRST AND WE SAW SOME THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT 
WE DECIDED TO TAKE REMOVE THAT RIGHT BREAST AND A FEW GLANDS FROM YOUR ARMPIT 
THERE WAS A BIT OF GLANDS THAT CANCER CELLS MANAGED TO GET INTO WHICH WERE REMOVED AS WELL 
HAVE YOU HEARD OF CHEMOTHERAPY 
OH YES YEAH WE'RE GOING TO REFER YOU TO THE ONCOLOGIST 
AND HE THINKS THAT YOU'LL BENEFIT A LOT FROM A BIT OF CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIOTHERAPY AS WELL 
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS 
NO AT LEAST I'LL SEE CHRISTMAS OUT WON'T I 
OUTSIDE THAT DOOR AM I COMING FOR GOOD OR BAD NEWS 
IT'S ALWAYS STRESSFUL WHEN YOU'RE BREAKING BAD NEWS TO PATIENTS ESPECIALLY IF IT'S CANCER 
IT'S BAD ENOUGH BUT THAT'S PART OF MY TRAINING AS WELL 
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT ALTHOUGH YOU'RE ALWAYS STRESSFUL AND YOU'RE ALWAYS WORRIED WHAT YOU CAN GET 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE EXPECTING HOW THEY WOULD REACT IT'S DIFFICULT THE NEWS 
YES ONE OF THE DIFFICULT PARTS OF THE DAY 
MO NEEDED THE SUPPORT OF THE GENERAL MEDICAL COUNCIL TO GET HIS JOB HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE 
NOW THEY'RE BACKING HIS APPLICATION FOR A NEW VISA SO HIS CAREER CAN PROGRESS 
THE FIRST OF JANUARY IS THE START OF THE APPLICATION FOR THE SPECIALITIES TRAINING FOR DOCTORS IN THIS COUNTRY 
AND WITHOUT THIS VISA I CAN'T COMPETE 
I CAN'T EVEN APPLY 
AT THE MOMENT I FILL IN THE APPLICATION FOR THE VISA 
YOU ADD UP THE POINTS YOU COLLECT DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH INCOME 
YOU MAKE WHAT KIND OF QUALIFICATIONS YOU HAVE 
AND IF THAT IS SATISFACTORY THEN AUTOMATICALLY YOU SHOULD GET THE IMMIGRATION VISA STATUS 
IF I GET REFUSED THIS APPLICATION I'LL HAVE TO PURSUE IT FURTHER 
I'LL PROBABLY APPEAL AND TAKE IT THROUGH TO COURT 
COS I JUST CAN'T THROW THIS OUT OF THE WINDOW TO BE HONEST 
THIS IS A COVERING LETTER 
AND THERE IS MY FUTURE RIGHT HERE 
FAMARA'S PLANS HAVE SUFFERED A MAJOR SETBACK 
HE'S RECEIVED A LETTER THREATENING TO STOP HIS HOUSING AND FOOD VOUCHERS 
HE'S APPLIED FOR VOLUNTARY RETURN A SCHEME WHICH WOULD GIVE HIM 
FINANCIAL HELP TO GO BACK TO THE GAMBIA 
SO NOW I HAVE TO DO THIS 
PROBABLY YOU CAN JUST SORT 
YEAH COS REFUGEE COUNCIL HAVE FAXED THE HOME OFFICE 
AND THEY'VE LET THEM KNOW THAT YOU'VE SIGNED UP FOR VOLUNTARY RETURN PROGRAMME 
THEREFORE YOU QUALIFY FOR SECTION FOUR 
MM H. M. M. O. K. YEAH SEE SECTION FOUR WILL NOT BE TERMINATED 
YOU CAN WITHDRAW THAT AT ANY TIME 
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE ALL SUPPORT AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE DESTITUTE 
I'LL TRY AND GET YOU AN APPOINTMENT AT THE LAW CENTRE 
TO SEE THE SOLICITOR AT THE LAW CENTRE 
THEY DO A CLINIC TWICE A WEEK 
BUT YOU DO NEED LEGAL ASSISTANCE 
I WANT TO BE A GOOD DOCTOR TRAINED TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS 
AND I HAVE THAT AMBITION SO I THINK I CAN DO IT BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OR NOT 
WHEN YOU MOVE FROM YOUR COUNTRY YOU JUST HAVE TO FACE A DIFFERENT WORLD 
FIRST YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE THE LANGUAGE BARRIER AND THE 
SYSTEM BARRIER YOU HAVE THE SOCIAL BARRIER AND THE CULTURE BARRIER 
THE WOUND ALWAYS HURTS FOR A WHILE BECAUSE YOU HAD A BIG OPERATION YOU KNOW ALL RIGHT 
IT DOES TAKE SOME TIME TO BE HONEST IT DOES TAKE A WHILE 
I'M SORRY YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS DEAR I'M SORRY 
BUT I'M SURE IT'S GOING TO GET BETTER 
TO EMIGRATE FROM YOUR COUNTRY IS A BIG DECISION TO TAKE 
AND IT'S NOT USUALLY A GOOD DECISION TO TAKE 
I WASN'T REALLY HAPPY TO LEAVE OUR COUNTRY YOU KNOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT 
IF MO GETS THE VISA HIS FIRST CHOICE IS TO BE A SURGEON 
THIS YEAR IS GONNA JUST BE LIKE MAKE OR BREAK FOR ME BECAUSE NOW IT'S QUITE LATE 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET A SPECIALIST TRAINING JOB THAT MEANS YOU'RE SORTED FOR YOUR LIFE 
IF NOT THEN YOU'LL BE UP AND DOWN MIGHT END UP UNEMPLOYED OR MOVING OUTSIDE THE U. K. TO WORK 
THE FEELING OF ACHIEVEMENT YOU GAIN AFTER THE END OF THE OPERATION IS SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL 
WHEN YOU SEE THEM A DAY OR TWO AFTER WHEN THEY GET MUCH BETTER AND THEY GO HOME THAT'S JUST 
I LOVE THAT BIT SO THAT'S PROBABLY WHY I WANT TO BE A SURGEON 
THIS ONE IS NICE 
ANNA'S FINALLY IN PLYMOUTH BUT ONLY ON A VISIT 
THIS IS A LOVELY HOUSE WHICH WE'VE JUST TAKEN ON 
FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY PER CALENDAR MONTH PART FURNISHED 
IT'S A TERRACED HOUSE 
TERRACED HOUSE YES THAT'S GOT A COURTYARD GARDEN 
LOVELY KITCHEN DINER 
NICE BIG COOKER YOU'VE GOT WASHING MACHINES 
SPACE AROUND HERE AND THEN AROUND HERE YOU'VE GOT A NICE COURTYARD 
SO FOR THE CHILDREN TO PLAY OUT IN THE SUMMER THAT'S QUITE NICE 
IT'S REALLY NICE AND SAFE THAT MAKES ME FEEL SAFE 
YES AND IT'S A NICE AREA AND IT'S A NICE SUNNY GARDEN AS WELL 
YES THAT'S NICE SO'S THIS ONE 
D'YOU THINK ANY OF THOSE ARE ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE SUITABLE 
WELL I LIKE THIS ONE 
THEY'RE LOOKING AT PROPERTIES THAT ARE SIX TIMES THE PRICE OF THOSE BACK HOME 
YEAH THIS IS THE HOUSE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT 
THIS IS THE ONE 
YEAH IT'S REALLY NICE WHAT IS IT 
THE CHIMNEY THE CHIMNEY OH YEAH IT'S NICE UH HUH 
HAS A BIG WINDOW MM H. M. M. 
SO THEY CALL THESE ONES TERRACED HOUSES 
MM H. M. M. 
IT HAS TO BECOME THE HOUSE I HAVE TO FEEL LIKE IS MY HOME 
BECAUSE IF I SPEND MAYBE FIVE YEARS IN A HOUSE 
I WANT TO FEEL LIKE IT'S COMFORTABLE LIKE IT'S MY HOME 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS AREA I WOULD LIKE TO LIVE HERE 
IT IS A BIT FAR FROM THE CITY WELL YES I KNOW 
BUT I REALLY LIKE THAT HOUSE WHICH ONE THAT ONE OR THAT ONE 
THAT ONE THERE 
THIS KIND OF AREA I WOULD LIKE TO RAISE UP MY KIDS BECAUSE IT'S A QUIET ONE 
THERE'S NO LIKE FRIDAY AND SATURDAY DRUNK PEOPLE ON THE STREETS AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
IT'S JUST NICE YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF A PROTECTION FOR US 
IT'S SOMETHING BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAD AND WE CAN LOOK UP A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT HIGHER TO THE THINGS 
NOT JUST LOOKING ON MY SHOES ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW 
WHAT SHE MEANS IS WE CAN HAVE HIGHER ASPIRATIONS IN LIFE YEAH 
SO ONCE I KNOW THAT I HAVE EVERYTHING SET AND I'VE STARTED THE COMPANY 
AND YOU KNOW I'LL RESERVE THE PLANE TICKETS AND WE'LL KNOW EXACTLY WHEN WE'RE GONNA ROLL MM H. M. M. 
OUR BIGGEST FEAR WAS THAT 
THE FAMILY'S GONNA SPLIT 
BECAUSE OUR RELATIONSHIP WASN'T REALLY GOOD AND WASN'T REALLY TIGHT 
WE WERE ALL THE TIME HAVING THIS FEAR THAT IF SOMETHING DOESN'T GO RIGHT EVERYTHING'S GONNA JUST FALL DOWN 
I THINK IT WORTH IT EVERY SINGLE 
DECISION AND EVERY SINGLE 
HOW YOU SAY M. M. SACRIFICE WHICH WE'VE MADE IT WORTH IT SO 
THE WAITING IS OVER FOR MO AND IT'S BAD NEWS 
DESPITE THE G. M. C.'S SUPPORT THE HOME OFFICE HAS REFUSED HIS VISA 
WHAT I PROVIDED IS GOOD ENOUGH IS DEFINITELY APPROPRIATE 
AND I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE JUDGING THE WHOLE THING 
I DON'T THINK I SHOULD APPEAL MY PROFESSION ISN'T MARKED ONE HUNDRED DEGREES OF WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH 
IT SHOULD MAKE ME ELIGIBLE FOR THE VISA 
BUT THIS IS DOUBLE STANDARDS IT'S OBVIOUS 
THE WAY THE HOME OFFICE OPERATES TOWARDS FOREIGNERS IS JUST DISGUSTING 
IT IS REALLY REALLY DISGUSTING 
I'M A BIT LOST TO BE HONEST I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA BE DOING VERY DISAPPOINTED 
FEEL I'VE WASTED MY TIME HERE 
DENIED THE CHANCE TO BECOME A SURGEON MO'S TAKING A BREAK TO CONSIDER HIS FUTURE 
FAMARA HAS ALSO REACHED THE END OF THE LINE 
ALL HE NOW WANTS IS TO GO HOME 
MY APPLICATION IS REJECTED AND EVERYTHING 
SO LET THEM GIVE ME A CHANCE 
I DON'T WANT TO GO VIOLENTLY YOU KNOW 
LET THESE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HELP ME TO TAKE ME HOME 
MAY THEY HAVE ME TO TAKE ME HOME IN PEACEFUL YOU KNOW 
AND SO ONCE AGAIN FAMARA MUST JUST WAIT 
FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS OR REFUGEES LIFE CAN BE A PERILOUS EXISTENCE 
I DON'T HAVE NO HOME IN THE WHOLE WORLD 
NOBODY KNOWS HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE LIVING STATELESS IN THE U. K. 
IF THEY WANT TO ARREST ME LET THEM ARREST ME 
BUT FOR E. U. CITIZENS EUROPE'S NOW ONE BIG COMMUNITY 
WHERE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS ARE FREE TO LIVE AND WORK WHEREVER THEY CHOOSE 
AND FOR CATALIN THIS FREEDOM IS FINALLY PAYING OFF 
I THINK THAT 
ONCE MY FAMILY ARRIVES AND THINGS SETTLE IN OUR LIVES 
THEN WE CAN GET THAT FEELING OF SECURITY 
AND SATISFACTION IN OUR LIVES 
BETTER CHANCE IN LIFE 
I DON'T REGRET ANYTHING UP TO THIS POINT AND SO FOR ME THIS HAS BEEN A GOOD CHOICE 
TO KNOW MORE ABOUT IMMIGRATION AROUND THE WORLD
