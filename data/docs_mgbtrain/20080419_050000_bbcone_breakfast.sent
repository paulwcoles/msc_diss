GOOD MORNING SATURDAY NINETEENTH OF 
APRIL ALSO ON TODAY'S PROGRAMME 
PUSH Y. G. PARENTS A EXPLOITING THE 
EXAM SYSTEM STRICTER RULES AS 
PUPILS ARE GIVEN MORE TIME AND 
EXTRA MARKS 
POLICE HAVE A SECOND CONTROLLED 
EXPLOSION IN BRISTOL ON ARRESTING A 
TEENAGER ON SUSPICION OF TERRORISM 
HOME IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD LEAVE 
A HOLE IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT HOME 
STANDARDS SAY WE WERE RIPPED OFFER 
LAST YEAR A FACE TO FACE FOR WORLD 
CHAMPION JOE CALZAGHE AS HE GETS 
READY TO GHETTO TO TOE IN LAS VAGAS 
TONIGHT TONIGHT WE'RE WELL AND TRULY SNOOCKKERD 
WITH THE WORLD CHAMPION AHEAD OF 
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS THAT START 
TODAY TODAY FIRST OUR MAIN STORY GORDON BROWN 
FLIES BACK TO BRITAIN TODAY TO FACE 
GROWING CONCERN FROM HIS OWN PARTY 
ABOUT THE ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. TAX 
RATE WHICH WILL LEAVE SOME PEOPLE 
ON LOW INCOMES WORSE OFF THE 
TREASURY SAY IT IS NOT TO CLIMB 
DOWNEN OVER THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE 
DESPITE A COMMENT BY ANGELA EAGLE 
TO WATCH THIS SPACE AFTER A TRIP 
OVERSHADOWED BY THE VISIT OF THE 
POPE TO AMERICA GORDON BROWN IS 
HEADING BACK TO MORE TROUBLE AT 
HOME OVER THE ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. 
TAX BAND THE PRIME MINISTER HAD TO 
INTERRUPT HIS SCHEDULE ON THURSDAY 
IN ORDER TO PERSUADE ANGELA SMITH 
NOT TO RESIGN OVER THE ISSUE NOW 
FIVE AIDES HAVE PUBLICLY VOICED 
THEIR CONCERNS FEELING ON LABOUR'S 
BACKBENCHES IS ONE OF DEEP UNEASE 
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE'VE DONE 
SINCE ONE HUNDRED NINETY NINE SEVEN IN TERMS OF TAX 
CHANGES CREDITS ANY OF THESE 
THINGS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY 
WEIGHTED IN FAVOUR OF THOSE ON 
LOWER INCOMES THIS RUNS COUNTER TO 
THAT IT STICKS OUT LIKE A SORE 
THUMB 
CRITICS SAY THE APPROPRIATE THUMB LIGS OF THE TAX BAND MAKES FIVE HUNDRED 
HOUSEHOLDS WORSE OFF THOSE AT THE 
LOWER END OF THE INCOME SCALE THE 
OPPOSITION ARE ADDING TO THE 
GOVERNMENT'S WORRIES 
WHAT WE'RE 
SEEING IS THE CRUMBLING OF GORDON 
BROWN'S AUTHORITY AND A GOVERNMENT 
FIGHTING EACH OTHER WHEN BRITISH 
FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES ARE VERY 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE ECONOMIC FUTURE 
AND ARE LOOKING FOR A STRONG 
GOVERNMENT THAT'S FIGHTING FOR 
BRITAIN RATHER THAN TURNING ON 
EACH OTHER 
REPORTS THE TREASURY IS 
PLANNING A CLIMB DOWN HAVE BEEN 
DENIED THE MESSAGE THAT IS LIKELY 
DENIED THE MESSAGE THAT IS LIKELY TO DEEPEN THE DISCOMFORT ON 
LABOUR'S BACKBENCHES HERE IS OUR 
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT GOOD 
MORNING MORNING THIS TEN P. VAIT CAUSING GORDON BROWN 
A LOT OF PROBLEMS 
YES AND I THINK 
WE ARE BEGINING TO SEE THE FIRST 
TENTATIVE SIGNS OF SOME SORT OF 
MOVEMENT BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING 
INDICATIONS THE TREASURY WHILE 
THEY WERE EAR NOT GOING TO ENGAGE 
IN A CLIMB DOWN ARE BEGINNING TO 
LOOK AT LONG TERM AT DIFFERENT 
OPTIONS LAST NIGHT WE HAD ANGELA 
EAGLE A TREASURY MINISTER SAYING 
WATCH THIS SPACE WHAT THEY ARE 
LOOKING AT IS IN NEXT YEAR'S PRE 
BUDGET REPORT COMING UP WITH SOME 
MEASURES TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE 
WORST AFFECTED BY THE ABOLITION OF 
THE TEN PENCE RATE THAT DOESN'T 
MEAN THERE'S GOING TO BE ANY CAVE 
IN IN NEXT WEEK'S VOTE BUT IT IS A 
TENTATIVE SIGN TO REBELS SAYING WE 
ARE SERIOUS WE KNOW YOU'RE 
CONCERNED AND WE WILL TRY AND DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT IT THERE IS 
MOVEMENT 
GORDON BROWN ARRIVES BACK MOVEMENT THIS MORNING BUT CIRCUMSTANCES IT 
APPEARS THAT HAVE BEEN AGAINST HIM 
THIS ISSUE OF THE TEN PENCE RATE 
FOLLOWED HIM OVER THERE THE POPE 
WAS THERE AT THE SAME TIME 
I THINK 
GORDON BROWN WAS FURIOUS AT THE WAY 
HIS TRIP TO SOME EXTENT HAS BEEN 
KNOCKED OFF COURSE BY DOMESTIC 
SQUABBLES PEOPLE LIKE SKA LORD 
CRITICISING HIM AS IF SAYING HE 
SPOKE AS IF HE WAS SPEAKING WITH 
HAGGIS OR PORRIDGE AND HE WAS 
GETTING ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT 
LITTLE KNOWN BACKBENCHERS KNOWN 
ABOUT THE TAX RAIFPLT HE WAS 
FURIOUS THE TRIP WAS NOT BY ANY 
MEANS A DISASTER IN DIPLOMATIC 
TERMS I THINK HE MANAGE TODAY PATCH 
UP RELATION WITH GEORGE BUSH THEY 
SEEM TO BE WARMER NOW IN BROAD 
TERMS HE MANAGED TO MEET ALL THE 
CONTENDERS FOR THE PRESIDENCY HE 
COULD FUT TO DOWN AS A QUALIFIED 
SUCCESS 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS SUCCESS GOING TO PUT FIFTY BILLION OF FUND 
INTO OUR BANKING SYSTEM TO KICK 
START THE MORTGAGE SYSTEM IT WILL 
BE OFFERED MONEY TO BANK AS SHORT 
TERM MORTGAGE BONDS WHICH CAB 
SWAPPED WITH MORTGAGES THAT THE 
BANK IS HAVING PROBLEMS SELLING ON 
THE CASH WILL TRICKLE DOWN INTO THE 
MORTGAGE MARKET MAKING IT EASIER 
FOR HOMEOWNERS TO GET A DEAL 
OPPOSITION PARTIES ARE LIKELY TO 
ACCUSE THE GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE THE 
PROBLEM WITH CREATIVE ACCOUNTING 
BUT THE CHAIR OF THE TREASURY 
SELECT COMMITTEE JOHN MCFALL TOLD 
THE B. B. C. HE SUPPORTED THE PLAN I I THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS 
NECESSARY IF WE DON'T HAVE WHAT 
THIS WILL MEAN IS THAT THE WHOLE 
MORTGAGE MARKET AND PERHAPS THE 
WHOLE ECONOMY WILL FREEZE UP AND 
WILL SEE THE MORTGAGE MARKET HALF 
AN M. P. HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH 
CRIMINAL DAMAGE AFTER CRAWLING OVER 
THE BONNET OF A VAN AT A BUS STOP 
HE SAID HE INTENDS TO PLAES NOT 
GUILTY TO THE CHARGE THEY HAVE 
BEEN ACCUSED OF MANIPULATING THE 
SCHOOL ADMISSIONS AND DOING THEIR 
CHILDREN'S COURSEWORK THEY ARE 
ACCUSED OF EXPLOITING THE SYSTEM TO 
AWARD EXTRA TIME AND MARKS TO 
PUPILS PUPILS THEY'RE CALLING SYMPTOMS OF 
DYSLEXIA AND DIABETES TO CALL FOR 
SPECIAL TREATMENT 
REVISING FOR A LEVELS THAT WILL 
FORM THEIR FUTURES HERE AT LUTON'S 
SIXTH FORM COLLEGE MORE STUDENTS 
ARE GIVEN SUPPORT AND EXTRA TIME IN 
EXAMS ALL UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYE 
OF THEIR EXAM'S MANAGER STUDENTS STUDENTS ARE MORE AWAY STAFF ARE MORE AWAY 
THAT THERE ARE STUDENTS WITH 
DIFFICULTIES WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING 
FORWARD WITH AS PERG JUS AUTISM 
WE WOULD NEVER HAVE SEEN THAT YEARS 
AGO 
THE SYSTEM HELPS STUDENTS LIKE AGO RACHEL WHO HAS A MOBILITY PROBLEM 
IN THE COLLEGE NOW I'M ALLOWED TO 
SIT THE EXAMS IN A SEPARATE ROOM 
WHICH MEANS I CAN STRETCH IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE XA 
BEFORE EXAMS 
SCHOOLS CAN AWARD STUDENTS UP TO 
TWENTY FIVE PER CENT TIME IF THEY HAVE SPECIAL 
ISSUES LIKE DYSLEXIA LAST YEAR THE 
NUMBER OF PUPILS GRANTED EXTRA TIME 
INCREASED BY TWENTY TWO PER CENT 
AFTER EXAMS PUPILS CAN APPEAL TO 
XA BOARDS FOR EXTRA MARKS THEY CAN 
GET A FIVE PER CENT INCREASE FOR A SERIOUS 
DOMESTIC CRISIS THREE PER CENT FOR DIABETES 
AND ASTHMA OR ONE PER CENT FOR A HEADACHE 
THESE ARE ON THE RISE AND THREE 
OUT OF ONE HUNDRED WERE TURNED DOWN THE 
NUT SAY THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS OPEN 
TO ABUSE ESPECIALLY TO INDEPENDENT 
SCHOOLS 
THE PUSHY PARENTS WILL PUT SCHOOLS TEACHERS UNDER PRESSURE WHAT THEY 
NEED IS THE CURRENT GUIDANCE 
BOILED DOWN L. L. THINK HAVING A 
PROPER CODE OF PRACTICE WHICH 
TEACHERS CAN SHOW TO PARENTS AND 
SAY THIS IS THE GUIDANCE THIS HAS 
BEEN WORKED OUT WITH SCHOOLS WE 
HAVE BEEN CONSULTED ON IT IT IS 
ENTIRELY REASONABLE AND THAT'S AS 
FAR AS I CAN GO 
THE EXAM SEASON IS 
UNDER WAY HERE WITH THE TEXTILE 
EXAM GOING ON BEHIND ME IT IS A 
TIME OF HUGE STRESS PRESSURE AND 
EXPECTATION M. FOR STUDENTS AND 
THEIR PARENTS WHICH IS WHY SOME 
MAY TRY TO GAIN EXTRA ADVANTAGE AT 
THIS CRITICAL TIME 
I HAVE MET 
PARENTS WHO DO PUT THEIR CHILDREN 
FORWARD FOR EXTRA THINGS SAY 
THEY'VE DYSLEXIA WHEN THEY DON'T 
REALLY 
I DON'T THINK IT IS FAIR AT REALLY ALL I REALLY REALLY DON'T L. 
THINK EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE AN EQUAL 
FOOTING 
ANY BENEFITS OR ADVANTAGES FOOTING YOU CAN SQUEEZE OUT YOU MAY AS 
WELL GO FOR IT 
THE EXAMS REGULATOR 
SAYS IT IS CONCERNED AND THIS 
SUMMER WILL BE MONITORING THE 
SITUATION CLOSELY 
WE'RE WORKING 
WITH THE AWARD BEING BODIES THE 
EXAM BOARDS TO TRY TO LOOK FOR 
CLOSELY INTO THE REASONS FOR THESE 
CANDIDATES ASKING FOR EXTRA TIME 
AND PARTICULARLY WHAT IS GOING ON 
IN 
THE SCHOOLS AND CLEPLGS MAKING MAKING THE SYSTEM FAIRER WHEN SO MUCH IS AT STAKE WON'T BE EASY 
WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION OF HEAD TEACHERS IN A 
FEW MINUTES TIMES POLICE ARE TO 
CARRY OUT AN EXPLOSION AT THE HOME 
OF A NINETEEN YEAR OLD MAN IN BRISTOL 
ANDREW IBRAHIM'S HOME WAS SEALED 
OFF YESTERDAY AND RESIDENTS HAVE 
BEEN EVACUATED WHEN POLICE 
DISCOVERED WHAT THEY CALLED SUSPECT 
MATERIAL IN THIS BRISTOL CUL DE S. A. C. 
A SECOND EXPLOSION WAS PLANNED IT 
WAS DUE TO BE CARRIED OUT LAST 
NIGHT BUT THE OPERATION WAS 
POSTPONED UNTIL THIS MORNING 
PENDING THE DELIVERY OF MORE 
SANDBAGS THE MAN HELD IN CUSTODY 
HAS BEEN NAMED LOCALLY AS NINETEEN YEAR 
OLD ANDREW IBRAHIM HE WAS 
ARRESTED ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON ON 
SUSPICION OF TERRORISM DETECTIVES 
HAVE BEEN GIVEN A WEEK TO QUESTION 
HIM POLICE SAID HE LIVED ALONE 
BUT THEY COULD NOT RULE OUT FURTHER 
ARRESTS 
WE ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES ARRESTS OF THIS INVESTIGATION EXTENSIVE 
INQUIRIES ARE ON GOING AND 
OBVIOUSLY THINGS WILL UNFOLD AS 
THE DAYS GO BY 
THE FIRST 
CONTROLLED EXPLOSION WAS CASH YEEED 
OUT OUTSIDE THE MAN'S HOME IN THE 
EARLY HOURS OF YESTERDAY MORNING 
POLICE SAID A CONTAINER WAS TAKEN 
FROM THE HOUSE AND COVERED IN 
SANDBAGS BEFORE BEING DESTROYED 
ABOUT THIRTY PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED FROM 
THEIR HOMES AND NOT YET HAVE BEEN 
ALLOWED TO RETURN ZIMBABWE'S 
ELECTORAL COMMISSION WILL BEGIN A 
RECOUNT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL BALLOT 
PAPERS DESPITE THE RESULT NEVER 
HAVING BEEN MADE PUBLIC THE MAIN 
OPPOSITION CANDIDATE MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI SAID HE DEFEATED MUGABE 
OUTRIGHT IN THE FIRST ROUND AND 
WON'T TAKE PART IN ANY RUNOFF 
MEANWHILE A CHINESE SHIP CARRYING 
WEAPONS FOR ZIMBABWE HAS HEADED 
BACK TO SEA AFTER DOCKED IN DURBAN 
WORKERS REFUSE TODAY UNLOAD THE 
SHIP SHIP POPE BENEDICT THE SIXTEENTH CALLED FOR THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO BETTER 
SERENE IF GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENTS 
FAIL TO PROTECT THEIR PEOPLES FROM 
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES THE POPE SAID 
THE REAL HARM CAME FROM 
INDIFFERENCE TO SUFFERING IT'S 
MORE THAN A YEAR SINCE THE 
CONTAINER SHIP THE NAPOLI RAN 
ASHORE OFF THE COAST OF DEVON 
SCAVENGERS TOOKITY CONTENTS NOW 
THE NAPLY IS PROVIDING A BONNANA 
FOR SCRAP METAL BADLY DEMAIDGE 
STORM THE NAPLY WAS DELIBERATELY 
SUNK MUCH OF ITS CARGO ENDED UP ON 
THE SHORE BARRELS HAULING 
FREVERING MOTOR BIKES TO BEAUTY 
CREAM A THIRD OF THE SHIP STILL 
LIES THERE BUT THE REST IS IN 
BELFAST WHERE BIT BY BIT IT IS 
SLOWLY BEING PULLED APART 
THIS IS WHERE THE CARGO WAS ONCE 
HELD BUT THERE'S STILL MUCH OF 
REAL WORK HERE TONNES AND TONNES 
OF STEEL CAPABLE OF BEING 
COMPLETELY RECYCLED 
NOW WE'VE 
ASSESSED THE SHIP DEALT WITH THE 
CONTAMINATION PHASE WE'RE IN THE 
SCRAPPING PHASE THERE'S ELEVEN THOUSAND 
TONNES OF SCRAP STEEL IN THE NAPLY 
FOR THE SECTION THAT WE HAVE HERE 
NOP POLLY THAT'S SENT TO STEAM 
MILLS IN EUROPE 
SOME OF THE STEEL 
WILL BE SENT TO CHINA IT WAS OF 
COURSE IN THIS SHIPYARD THE MOST 
FAMOUS DOOMED VESSEL OF THEM ALL 
THE TITANIC WAS BUILT IT IS HERE 
AFTER THE ILL FATED JOURNEY THE 
NAPOLI IS FACE AGO NEW LEASE OF 
LIFE THAT'S BECAUSE MUCH OF THE 
STEEL COULD END UP BEING USED AGAIN 
IN SHIP BUILDING THE NAPOLI WILL 
NEVER SAIL AGAIN BUT PARTS COULD 
RETURN TO THE SEAS THOSE ARE THE 
MAIN STORIES THIS MORNING TIME IS 
SIX THIRTEEN A M. PUPILS ARE INCREASINGLY 
USING HARD LUCK TALES LIKE THE 
DEATH OF A PET OR HEADACHE TO WIN 
EXTRA MARKS IN THEIR EXAMS THESE 
ARE JUST TWO OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
WHICH CAN SECURE WHAT IS KNOWN AS 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATION FROM THE 
EXAMINERS BUT THERE'S GROWING 
CONCERN SOME STUDENTS ARE TAKING 
UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM 
CHRIS HOWARD IS FROM THE NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION OF HEAD TEACHERS AND 
HE JOINS US THIS MORNING 
GOOD MORNING TO YOU 
AS I UNDERSTAND IT THREE HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND 
REQUESTS WERE PUT THROUGH LAST YEAR 
TO MAKE SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
THAT IS AN AWFUL LOT OF PUPILS IT IT DOES SEEM TO BE GROWING DOESN'T 
IT I'M AFRAID IT IS ANOTHER 
EXAMPLE OF HOW TOO MANY BURDENS ARE 
PLACED ON SCHOOLS TO QUITE HONESTLY 
TO LITTLE EFFECT 
BUT THE EFFECT OF THIS PEOPLE MAY 
BE SURPRISED THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW 
THE SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE IF AFTER 
THE EXAM YOU APPROACH THE SCHOOL 
AND SAY MY SON OR DAUGHTER HAD A 
HEADACHE YOU'RE CERTAIN TO GET A 
ONE PER CENT ADDITION TO WHATEVER THEIR AS A 
RESULT 
THAT IS CORRECT I'M SURE RESULT AS A RESULT OF THIS BROADCAST THIS 
MORNING THAT WILL INCREASE THIS 
SUMMER ONCE PARENTS KNOW THEY CAN 
SECURE THIS SLIGHT ADVANTAGE THEY 
ARE PRONE TO ASK FOR IT AND 
SCHOOLS N. THE INTEREST OF THEIR 
YOUNGSTERS OF COURSE ARE REQUIRED 
TO MAKE A JUDGMENT ABOUT WHETHER 
THEY SHOULD SUPPORT THAT OR NOT 
AND THEN COMPLETE THE NECESSARY 
BUREAUCRACY TO SUPPORT THE CLAIM I I SUPPOSE IT IS VERY HARD TO 
DETERMINE HOW MUCH PEOPLE ARE 
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM 
WHAT'S YOUR SENSE 
MY SENSE IS THAT 
TEACHERS TRY TO DO THE BEST FOR 
THEIR YOUNGSTERS BUT THEY ALSO 
UNDERSTAND THAT FAIRLY TRIVIAL 
PROBLEMS ARE BEING REWARDED INSIDE 
THE SYSTEM AND HAVING SEEN ONE 
YOUNGSTER BENEFIT THEY WILL USE 
THE SYSTEM TO GET THE BEST FOR 
OTHER YOUNGSTERS AS WILL PARENTS 
THE SYSTEM IT IS THE SYSTEM THAT 
NEEDS LOOKING AT AND IT CLEARLY 
DOES NEED A REVIEW I'M GLAD TO 
HEAR THE REGULATOR SAY THEY WILL 
LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT WHAT IS 
HAPPENING THIS SUMMER ONE OF THE 
THINGS THAT CONCERNS ME FOR EXAMPLE 
S. THE REWARD INSIDE IN TERMS OF 
MARKS THAT MIGHT BE GAINED FOR A 
SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEM SUCH AS A 
TERMINAL ILLNESS ISN'T HUGELY 
DIFFERENT FROM THAT AWARDED FOR A 
HEADACHE OR TEMPORARY BOUT OF HAY 
FEVER 
YOU CAN GET UP TO FIVE PER CENT INCREASE FOR 
TERMINAL ILLNESS OR DEATH OF THE 
IMMEDIATE FAMILY THAT COMPARES 
WITH ONE PER CENT FOR SAYING THAT YOU HAD A 
HEADACHE 
THAT IS WHAT DOES SEEM HEADACHE UNFAIR I THINK THAT SCHOOLS WHEN 
THEY SEE THAT AT THE LOWER LEVELS 
OF PROBLEM IF THEY ARE ASKED TO 
SUPPORT A CLAIM THEY MAY WELL PASS 
IT ON TO THE BOARD AND ASK THE 
BOARD TO REFEREE IT THERE IN LAYS 
THE PROBLEM L. WOULD BE FAR HAPPIER 
IF THE NUMBER OF CASES WHICH COULD 
BE REWARDED WERE TIGHTENED UP AND 
IF THRUZ WAS AN GREATER EXTERNAL 
WAY TO SHOW IT WAS OF A SIGNIFICANT 
NATURE 
WHICH OF 
THE CATEGORYS IS NATURE THE GREATER YOU MENTIONED THE 
TRIVIAL NATURE OF SOME OF THESE 
ISSUES WHICH FOR YOU STAND OUT 
LOOKING AT ALL THE THINGS WHICH 
MIGHT GAIN YOU REWARD I THINK MOST 
OF THE PROBLEMS ARE ENLISTED AS 
REQUIRING ONE OR TWO PER CENT 
SUPPORT COULD BE SWEPT AWAY WITHOUT 
TOO MUCH DIFFICULTY THEN ONE MIGHT 
BE ABLE TO CONCENTRATE ON THINGS 
WHICH ARE MORE SERIOUS 
THANK YOU 
FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING 
IF YOU HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY ANY OF 
THE ISSUES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
THERE IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN WHO 
COMING UP FOR EXAMS MAYBE YOU HAVE 
USED THIS SYSTEM LEGITIMATELY 
YOURSELF GET IN TOUCH WE WILL 
SPEAK TO GUESTS LATER ON 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS NOT 
BUDGING ON THE ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. 
INCOME TAX RATE DESPITE CONCERNS 
OF SOME LABOUR M. P.'S CLAIMS PUSHY 
PARENTS ARE EXPROITING THE EXAM 
SYSTEM TEACHERS CALL FOR THOUSAND 
RULES AS MORE PUPILS ARE GIVEN MORE 
TIME AND EXTRA MARKS STILL TO COME 
OPEN SESAME 
BREAK DOWN THAT DOWN 
TO GET THEM TO HIRE ME

THERE WILL NOT BE A GREAT DEAL OF 
RAIN IN IT IT WILL STAY CLOUDY 
OVER AEPBGD WALES IT WILL BE A 
MILD NIGHT WITH TEMPERATURES SEVEN

POTENTIALLY HEAVY SHOWERS OVER THE 
SOUTH WEST CORNER WE WILL FIRM UP 
ON THE DETAILS OVER THE NEXT FEW 
HOURS THE START OF THE NEW WORKING 
WEEKS LOOKS LIKE IT WILL STAY 
CLOUDY 
SO YOU WANT TO MOVE HOUSE BUT 
ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE COST OF A NEW 
MORTGAGE YOU GET THE BUILDERS IN 
IT IS A WAY TO ADD VALUE ACCEPT IF 
THEY ARE NOT UP TO THE JOB WE 
WASTE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION ON HOME 
IMPROVEMENTS CARRIED OUT BY COWBOY 
BUILDERS THEY SAY IT IS TIME LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES STAMPED OUT ROGUE 
TRADERS IT IS NOT THE LATEST IN 
INDUSTRIAL CHIC IT IS A BUILDING 
JOB WHICH WENT WRONG WHEN RAY 
WANTED THIS EXTENSION DONE HE USED 
A FIRM RECOMMENDED BY HIS ARCHITECT 
THE WORK HAS NOT BEEN DONE PROPERLY 
DESPITE THAT THE BUILDERS HAVE SAID 
THEY ARE NOT COMING BACK THIS THIS EXPERIENCE HAS LEFT ME DISAPPOINTED 
I FEEL THAT HAVING DONE A CERTAIN 
AMOUNT OF HOMEWORK IT IS STILL 
FRAUGHT WITH DANGER ONCE THEY HAVE 
YOUR MONEY THEN YOU ARE IN THE LAP 
OF THE GODS IF THEY ARE NICE 
PEOPLE THEY WILL DO WHAT THEY ARE 
SUPPOSED TO IF NOT YOU DON'T HAVE 
A RERECOURSE 
UNTIL EVERYTHING IS 
DONE THE COUNCIL WILL NOT SIGN IT 
OFF AND GIVE RAY A CERTIFICATE HE 
NEEDS WITHOUT IT THOUSANDS COULD 
BE KNOCKED OFF THE VALUE OF HIS 
HOME THE PROBLEM OF DODGEY 
BUILDERS HAS BEEN AROUND MANY YEARS 
IT IS GETTING WORSE TRADING 
STANDARDS SAY IT IS TIME COUNCILS 
CRACK DOWN ON BUILDERS 
WE ESTAI 
MAILT THE COST TO THE CONSUMER IS 
OVER SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR THAT IS 
RISING LOCAL AUTHORITIES NEED TO 
PUT THIS TO THE TOP OF THEIR 
PRIORITIES TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM 
AND GET ROGUE TRADERS OUT OF 
BUSINESS 
THE DRAMATIC SLOWDOWN IN BUSINESS THE HOUSING MARKET COULD MEAN A 
BOOM IN HOME IMPROVEMENTS THE THE STATE OF THE HOUSING MARKET MEANS 
THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO 
IMPROVE THE HOME THEY HAVE GOT 
RATHER THAN LOOKING TO BUY ANOTHER 
ONE IT MEANS THEY ARE LOOKING TO 
DO BIGGER HOME IMPROVEMENTS WHEN 
WE SURVEYED WHICH READERS FORTY PER CENT HAD 
PROBLEMS WHEN THEY HAD WORK DONE ON 
THEIR HOUSE 
MANY OF US FIND IT 
HARD TO KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD PAY FOR 
A JOB TOO LITTLE AND YOU COULD BE 
HIRING A COWBOY TOO MUCH AND YOU 
MAY BE RIPPED OFF WE RANG THREE 
FIRMS OF BUILDERS AND ASKED THEM TO 
QUOTE FOR A CONSURVEY TORY WE GAVE 
THEM EXACT DETAILS OF HOW LARGE 
THE MATERIALS THEY SHOULD USE AND 
THE STYLE WE LIKED ONE FIRM 
RECKONED TWENTY THOUSAND ANOTHER SAID THEY 
COULD BUILD IT FOR TEN THOUSAND AND THE 
LAST FIRM WE RANG PROMISED TO BUILD 
THE CONSURVEY TORY FOR TWO FIVE HUNDRED BUT 
THEY WANTED TO BE PAID CASH IN HAND 
THE BUILDERS' TRADE BODY SAY PAYING 
BICARB IS ALWAYS A BAD IDEA THE THE FALLING HOUSE MARKET PEOPLE WILL BE 
TEMPTED TO TAKE ON COWBOY BUILDERS 
DO THE JOB ON THE CHEAP AVOIDING 
VAT IF YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN THE 
VALUE GET A PROFESSIONAL BUILDER IN 
UNTIL THERE IS CRACKDOWN ON ROGUE 
TRADERS GETTING SOMEONE IN COULD BE 
A LOTTERY THE ONLY PERSON WHO IS 
GUARANTEEED TO HIT THE JACKPOT IS 
THE BUILDER 
YOU CAN SEE THE NUMBERS ON THE 
SCREEN NOW IF YOU HAVE HAD PROBLEMS 
WITH DODGEY BUILDERS MAYBE YOUR 
HOME RENOVATIONS HAVE GONE WRONG 
MAYBE FOR SOME ADVICE GET IN TOUCH

TONIGHT'S FIGHT JOE CALZAGHE'S HAD 
TO WORK HARD FOR A DECADE TO BECOME 
AN OVERNIGHT SENSATION IN THE 
UNITED STATES AL TO GET HIS NAME

THE BIG NAMES OF BOXING HAD THEIR 
MOMENTS IN VEGAS NOW IT IS TIME

OF THE SUPER MIDDLEWEIGHT DIVISION

WEIGHTS

I COME AND DO A JOB AND I LEAVE 
BOTH BOXERS WEIGHED IN AT SEVENTEEN POUNDS 
THEY'VE HARDLY SPOKEN TO EACH OTHER 
IN THE BUILD UP HOPKINS THINKS 
CALZAGHE HAS NEVER BEEN OUT OF HIS 
COMFORT ZONE THAT IS FIGHTING IN 
THE U. K. AND PLANS TO SEND CALZAGHE 
HOME TO WALES A BEATEN MAN BUT THE 
CALZAGHE WILL TAKE HEART FROM THE 
TRAVELLING SUPPORT FROM WALES AND 
BEYOND THAT WILL MAKE A SMALL PART 
OF VEGAS FEEL VERY MUCH LIKE HOME 
JOE CALZAGHE STANDS ON THE VERGE OF 
BECOMING THE BEST BRITISH BOXER OF 
ALL TIME HE IS PREPARED AND MADE 
THE WEIGHT AND NOW HE IS PLANNING 
TO SHOW THE HUGE AMERICAN BOXING 
AUDIENCE JUST WHAT THEY'VE BEEN 
MIXING WELL NOW THEY PROMISED 
FIREWORKS AND WE GOT THEM THE 
INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE WHICH PLANS 
TO SHAKE CRICKET UP TO ITS CORE 
STARTED IN SPECTACULAR STYLE T. 
STARTED IN BANGALORE WITH BRENDON 
MCCULLUM SMASHING HIS WAY TO THE 
HIGHEST TO ANY FORM TO T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY 
CRICKET HE SCORED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT NOT OUT IN 
TWELVE POINT ONE OVERS THAT'S MORE THAN TWO A 
BALL N. FRONT OF A PACKED STADIUM 
IT'S CRICKET BUT NOT AS WE KNOW T. 
THE INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE IS BILLED 
AS THE TOURNAMENT THAT COULD CHANGE 
THE SPORT FOREVER THIS IS NOT THE 
INTRODUCTION THE PLAYERS GET AT 
LORDS IT HAD ALL THE PROMISED 
RAZZMATAZZ TWO HOURS BEFORE THE 
START THE MUSIC WAS BLARING AND THE 
CROWDS TURNED UP FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND PACKED IN 
THE STADIUM AND THEY WERE IN FOR A 
TREAT DANCING TIGERS STILT 
WALKERS AND CHEERLEADERS AND THEN 
THE ARRIVAL OF THE POWER RANGERS 
THEY EARNING FOOTBALLER WAGES BUT 
BRENDON MCCULLUM STOLE THE SHOW IT 
WASN'T JUST SPECIAL BUT 
SPECTACULAR HE WAS EVERY PART 
SWASH BUCKLING BOLLYWOOD HERO THE 
RECORD FOR TUM BILLING HIGHEST 
SCORE IN T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT FROM EIGHTY THREE 
BALLS A NIGHT RIDERS WERE FROM 
CRUISE CONTROL CHASING TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THREE TO WIN 
WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE AN UPHILL 
STRUGGLE FOR BANGALORE EVEN THE 
CAPTAIN DIDN'T HANG AROUND FOR LONG 
FROM THAT POINT ON THE ROYAL 
CHALLENGERS NEVER CHALLENGED ALL 
OUT FOR EIGHTY TWO FITTINGLY IT WAS 
MCCULLUM WHO TOOK THE FINAL CATCH 
HE IS THE FIRST STAFF OF THE I. P. L. 
AND WON'T BE THE LAST NOW THE TWO 
MOST SPOP LATER SPORTS ARE CRICKET 
AND THE ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE 
FOOTBALL IT IS THAT TIME OF SEASON 
WHEN A SLIPPUP CAN BE DECISIVE NO 
ONE IS EXPECTING MANCHESTER UNITED 
TO FALL NOW IF THEY WIN AT 
BLACKBURN THEY WILL REESTABLISH 
THEIR PLACE AT THE TOP 
IT IS NOT 
THE EASIEST PLACE TO GO TO WE WON 
THEIR LAST SEASON L. DON'T 
NECESSARILY SAY IT IS A BAD RECORD 
IT IS NOT A GREAT RECORD BUT AS A 
POINT OF OTHER CLUBS I FOUND IT 
DIFFICULT IT IS A DIFFICULT PLACE 
TO GO TO BUT I GOT A STRONG SQUAD 
AND GOT A TEAM THAT'S CONSISTENT 
PERFORMING WELL L. CAN'T GO THERE 
IN THE BEAR TIME IF I'M TAKING A 
BUNCH OF PLAYERS UP TO BLACKBURN 
THIS IS DEFINITELY THE RIGHT TIME 
LIVERPOOL DEFENDED THEIR DECISION 
TO FILL WEAKENED SIDE 
EVEN IF IT UPSETS BOLTON JUST 
THREE POINTS ABOVE THE DROP ZONE OF 
READING THEY GET ARSENAL TODAY ON ON THREE OR FOUR OCCASIONS THIS YEAR 
WE'VE HAD SIGNIFICANT GAMES 
OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE PERHAPS 
THOUGHT WE SHOULD WIN AND WE 
HAVEN'T WE JUST HAVEN'T PLAYED 
OUR BEST RESULTS THIS YEAR IS WHEN 
THERE'S LITTLE EXPECTATION AND I'M 
HOPING THAT WILL BE THE CASE THIS 
SATURDAY 
YOU CAN SEE MORE OF THAT SATURDAY INTERVIEW ON FOOTBALL FOCUS AT 
TWELVE TEN P. M. TWELVE TEN P. M. NOW AFTER THEIR INJURY TIME IN THE 
OLD FIRM DERBY CELTIC CAN GO BACK 
ABOVE RANGERS TODAY F. THEY WIN AT 
HOME TO ABERDEEN 
THE GERS WHICH ARE IN SEMI CUP 
ACTION WILL BE IN FAVOURITES WITH 
THREE GAMES IN HAND BUT CELTIC ARE 
MAKING CONTEST OF IT 
THE MAIN SET IS TO WIN EVERY GAME 
JUST TO TRY AND KEEP AS POSITIVE AS 
POSSIBLY YOU CAN BE OBVIOUSLY 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR FAVOUR FROM 
OTHER TEAMS BUT ALL WE CAN DO IS 
PUT ENOUGH PRESSURE ON RANGERS TO 
TRY AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM 
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY STILL IN THE 
DRIVING SEAT BY A LONG WAY 
NOW LEINSTER MISSED THE CHANCE TO 
WRAP UP THE MAGNERS LEAGUE 
ADVERTISEMENT LAST NIGHT THEY 
NEEDED A BONUS POINT AWAY BUT THEY 
LOST LEINSTER HAD SEEN PLENTY OF 
THE BALL BUT UNABLE TO CONVERT THE 
PRESSURE IN TRIES IT TOOK THE 
LEAGUE LEADERS TO SCORE A TRY 
THEMSELVES FITZGERALD HELPING THE 
SIDE TO WITHIN ONE SCORE OF THE 
OPPONENTS THEY MISSED AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO GET A LATE VICTORY 
ARE STILL THIRTEEN POINTS CLEAR

MUMS AND DADS AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
HERE AND THEY'RE ALL TREATING ME 
LIKE A NORMAL RUN OF THE MILL 
PLAYER WHICH IS GOOD 
RUN OF THE MILL HE'S CERTAINLY NOT 
BUT HE IS HAPPY TO GIVE ALMOST GAME GAME IT IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE OF 
COURSE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE 
UNDER PRESSURE IN A TOURNAMENT 
YOUR HEAD IS GOING AROUND AND 
AROUND YOU CAN'T CONCENTRATE YOUR 
HEAD IS LIKE A LOGGERS YOU PUT 
YOUR HAND DOWN AND GET A SOLID BASE 
OF COURSE WHEN JOHN IS IN FORM HIS 
OPPONENTS DON'T GET MUCH OF A 
CHANCE TO FEEL PRESSURE ALL I 
COULD DO WAS DREAM 
IT'S ALL RIGHT JOHN IT IS ONLY A 
DREAM BEST OF LUCK HE IS SUCH A 
NICE BLOKE HE SAID I HAD TO WIN

LOVELY MAN IT COULD BECOME ONLY 
VERY RARIER TO WIN BACK TO BACK

COME A LONG WAY ALTHOUGH 
TECHNOLOGY IS CREEPING INTO EVERY 
DAY PRACTICES HAVING AN X. RAY IS A 
STANDARD PROCEDURE THERE IS A 
PROBLEM WITH THESE THINGS THEY ARE 
PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM THEY TAKE A 
WHILE TO DEVELOP IF SOMEONE ELSE 
IN THE HOSPITAL WANTS TO SEE YOUR 
X. RAY YOU NEED TO PUT IT INTO AN 
ENVELOPE HAVE YOU NOTICED 
HOSPITALS CAN BE BIG PLACE ALL 
THAT COULD TAKE SOME TIME THERE IS 
IS A SOLUTION THAT IS TO GO

PHOTOGRAPHIC CHEMICALS THIS BEAST 
OF A MACHINE SCANS THE IMAGE INTO 
CENTRAL DATABASE MAKING IT 
INSTANTLY AVAILABLE HERE THE

HIGHS ON HIGH RESOLUTION SCREENS 
WHILE OTHER HOSPITALS DO THE SAME 
THING HERE IN CHESTER THEY HAVE 
GONE ONE STEP FORWARD USING SPEECH 
RECOGNITION WITH SPECIALISED 
MEDICAL DICTIONARY TO ADD NOTES TO 
THE IMAGE CUTS OUT THE NEED FOR 
DICK TAITION AND ELIMINATES ERRORS 
THE REPORTSVY DONE THIS MORNING 
NOW I WILL STOP FOR A QUICK BREAK I 
WILL SIGN THEM OFF THE REPORTS ARE 
AVAILABLE TO THE DOCTORS ON THE 
WARDS WHAT NEED INFORMATION THERE 
IS NO NEED TO SIT AROUND WRITING 
FOR THE TYPISTS TO WRITE UP THE 
REPORTS 
IT WILL BE A MISTAKE TO REPORTS ACKTKHULLY THINK THAT INNOVATION IS 
I THINK I WOULD ACTUALLY BE A 
MISTAKE TO THINK INNOVATION IS 
LINKED TO THE HEALTH SERVICE IN 
ITS SIXTY YEAR HISTORY IT HAS SEEN A 
TREMENDOUS CHANGE IN THE WAY THAT 
HEALTH CARE IS DELIVERED TO THE 
PATIENT IT IS JUST THAT RECENTLY 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT THE 
ACTUAL USER INTERFACE WITH THE 
HEALTH SERVICE HAS CHANGED 
RADICALLY 
THE NEW INTERFACE STARTS RADICALLY AT THE FRONT DOOR PATIENTS CAN 
REGISTER HERE AT THE FRONT DOOR 
THIS SIGNALS THEIR ARRIVAL ON THE 
WARD THAT IS NOT THE ONLY USE FOR 
THE TOUCH SCREEN THIS TAB LET P. C. 
IS BEING USED TO REPLICATE THE 
STANDARD DRAWINGS MADE DURING AN 
APPOINTMENT WITH THE SIES YO 
THERAPIST ALL THE STUFF YOUR 
DOCTOR GATHERS FOR YOU IS STORED 
CENTRALLY INSTALLING A WIRELESS 
NETWORK MAKES THAT DATA EASIER TO 
READ OR IN THIS CASE UP DATE ONCE 
YOU HAVE YOUR W. I. FI NETWORK SET 
NEWSPAPER A HOSPITAL YOU CAN DO 
OTHER THINGS WITH IT APART FROM 
JUST SEND PATIENT RECORDS PATIENTS 
ARE NOT THE ONLY IMPORTANT THING 
LOIS AROUND THESE PLACES DOCTORS 
NEED EQUIPMENT WHICH IS MOBILE 
WHICH USUALLY MEANS FITTING WHEELS 
TO EVERYTHING THAT CAN MAKE THE 
RIGHT BIT OF KIT HARD TO FIND IN A 
HURRY STAFF HERE HAVE A BUTTON ON 
THEIR PHONE MARKED KUO WEE YOU 
PRESS IT MARKED COOEE

EXPECT IT POINT S. YOU IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION THE SYSTEM KNOWS WHERE 
EACH BIT OF EQUIPMENT IS BY LOOKING 
FOR A TAG AND THEN WORKING BETWEEN 
THREE W. I. FI ACCESS POINTS W. I. FI 
PHONES GI ACK ESS TO THE AUTOMATED 
SYSTEM WHEN YOU ARE AWAY FROM THE 
DESK 
PREVIOUSLY WHEN YOU WANTED DESK EQUIPMENT YOU WOULD HAVE TO RING 
AROUND THE WARDS TO SEE IF THEY HAD 
IT THEY WOULD FIND KNIT A CUPBOARD 
SOMETIMES THEY WOULDN'T LOOK IN THE 
CUPBOARD THAT WOULD TAKE TWENTY 
MINUTES NOW ALL WE NEED IS TO LOOK 
ON COMPUTER PHONE FOR A PORTER AND 
THEN THE EQUIPMENT COMES 
IN THEORY 
NOTHING WILL EVER BE LOST AGAIN L. 
BISH I COULD SAY THE SAME I WISH 
I COULD SAY THE SAME ABOUT ME THIS 
OUTBREAK OF HIGH TECH HEALTH CARE 
IS NOT CONFINED TO HOSPITALS L. 
HAVE HIT THE ROAD WITH THE 
PARAMEDICS FIRST IT IS TIME FOR

FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY TO ONE NASA SAID IT IS CONFIDENT OF 
ITS FIGURES GREAT I THINK I WILL 
HANG ON TO MY TIN HAT NOW THEN TO 
HAVE ALL KINDS OF COOL TECHNOLOGY 
IN A HOSPITAL IS GREAT MOST 
MEDICAL SITUATIONS DON'T START IN A 
HOSPITAL THAT IS WHERE THIS THING 
COMES IN AND IT IS SLIGHTLY MORE 
THAN AN AMBULANCE I CAN TELL YOU 
IF YOU HAVE A MAJOR INCIDENT MAYBE 
A BOMB GOES OFF OR THERE IS A 
CHEMICAL INCIDENT SOMETHING 
INVOLVING MASS CASUALTIES THIS 
TURNS UP AND BECOMES A COMMAND AND 
CLUE CENTRE THE FIRST CLUE ARE THE 
DISHES AND MASTS ON THE ROOF THEY 
CAN BE ERECTED WITHIN THREE MINUTES 
OF THIS THING TURNING UP NOW THE 
FRONT OF THIS WEEK IS PRETTY MUCH 
LIKE ANY OTHER AMBULANCE WHICH 
MEANS YOU HAVE THINGS LIKE SAT NAV 
WHICH THE GUYS CAN PAY ATTENTION TO

HOME FROM AMERICA TO A GROWING ROW 
OVER ABOLISHING THE TEN PENCE RATE 
POLICE PLAN A SECOND CONTROLLED 
EXPLOSION IN BRISTOL AFTER 
ARRESTING A TEENAGER ON SUSPICION 
OF TERRORISM THE HOME IMPROVEMENTS 
THAT COULD LEAVE A HOLE IN YOUR 
BANK ACCOUNT TRADING STANDARDS SAY 
THEY WERE RIPPED OFF TO THE TUNE OF 
SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION LAST YEAR 
IN SPORT IT IS FACE TO FACE FOR 
WORLD CHAMPION CALZAGHE AS HE GETS 
READY TO GO TOE TO TOE IN LAS VAGAS 
TONIGHT COMING UP WE'RE WELL AND 
TRULY SNOOKERED WITH THE WORLD 
CHAMPION AHEAD OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS THAT WILL START TODAY 
FIRST OUR MAIN STORY THIS MORNING 
THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF 
MANIPULATING SCHOOL ADMISSIONS AND 
DG THEIR CHILDREN'S COURSEWORK NOW 
PUSHY PARENTS STAND ACCUSED OF 
EXPLOITING THE SYSTEM THAT AWARDS 
EXTRA TIME AND MARKS TO PUPILS 
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PUPILS USED A FAMILY CRISIS 
OR CONDITIONS AS HEADACHE DISLIB 
DEMA OR DIABETES TO GET EXTRA 
MARKS BUT THE NUT SAY IT IS OPEN 
TO ABUSE AND CALLING FOR A PROPER 
CODE OF PRACTICE REVISING FOR A 
LEVELS THAT WILL FORM THEIR FUTURES 
MORE STUDENTS THAN EVER ARE GIVEN 
SUPPORT AND EXTRA TIME IN EXAMS 
ALL UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYE OF 
EXAM'S MANAGER 
STUDENTS ARE MORE 
AWARE STAFF ARE MORE AWARE THAT 
THERE ARE STUDENTS WITH 
DIFFICULTIES WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING 
FORWARD WITH ASPERG US AUTISM WE 
WOULD NEVER HAVE SEEN THAT YEARS 
AGO 
THE SYSTEM HELP PUPILS LIKE AGO RACHEL 
IN THE COLLEGE NOW I'M RACHEL ALLOW TODAY SIT THE EXAMS IN A 
SEPARATE ROOM WHICH MEANS I CAN 
STRETCH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EXAM 
BEFORE EXAMS SCHOOLS CAN AWARD 
STUDENTS UP TO TWENTY FIVE PER CENT EXTRA TIME IF 
THEY HAVE DYSLEXIA OR HYPER 
ACTIVITY DISORDER THE NUMBER OF 
PUPILS GRANTED EXTRA TIME INCREASED 
BY TWENTY TWO PER CENT AFTER EXAMS PUPILS CAN 
APPEAL TO EXAM BOARDS FOR EXTRA 
MARKS THEY CAN GET A FIVE PER CENT INCREASE 
FOR A SERIOUS DOMESTIC CRISIS THREE PER CENT 
FOR DIABETES OR ASTHMA AND ONE PER CENT FOR 
A HEADACHE THESE REQUESTS ARE ALSO 
ON THE RISE AND LAST YEAR ONLY 
THREE OUT OF ONE HUNDRED WERE TURNED DOWN 
THE NUT THINK THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS 
OPEN TO ABUSE ESPECIALLY IN 
INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS 
THE OCCASIONAL PUSHY PARENT WILL 
PUT TEACHERS UNDER PRESSURE WHAT 
THEY NEED I THINK IS THE CURRENT 
GUIDANCE BOILED DOWN L. THINK 
ACTUALLY HAVING A PROPER CODE OF 
PRACTICE WHICH TEACHERS CAN SHOW 
TO PARENTS AND SAY THIS IS THE 
GUIDANCE THIS HAS BEEN WORKED OUT 
WITH SCHOOLS WE HAVE BEEN 
CONSULTED ON IT IT IS ENTIRELY 
REASONABLE AND THAT'S AS FAR AS I 
CAN GO 
EXAM SEASON IS ALREADY UNDER WAY 
HERE WITH THIS TEXTILE EXAM GOING 
ON BEHIND ME IT IS A TIME OF HUGE 
STRESS PRESSURE AND EXPECTATION 
FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS 
WHICH IS WHY SOME MAY TRY TO GAIN 
EXTRA ADVANTAGE AT THIS CRITICAL 
TIME TIME I HAVE MET PARENTS WHO DO PUT THEIR 
CHILDREN FORWARD FOR EXTRA THINGS 
SAY THEY'VE DYSLEXIA AND THINGS 
LIKE THAT WHEN THEY DON'T REALLY 
I DON'T THINK IT IS FAIR AT ALL L. 
REALLY DON'T EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE 
AN EQUAL FOOTING 
ANY BENEFIT OR 
ADVANTAGES THAT YOU CAN SQUEEZE 
OUT YOU MAY AS WELL GO FOR IT THE THE EXAMS REGULATOR SAY IT IS SKERNED 
AND THIS SUMMER WILL BE MONITORING 
THE SITUATION CLOSELY 
WE'RE WORKING WITH THE AWARDING 
BODIES THE EXAM BOARDS THAT RUN 
THE EXAMS TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY THIS 
YEAR INTO THE REASONS FOR THESE 
CANNED DALTS ASKING FOR EXTRA TIME 
AND PARTICULARLY WHAT IS GOING ON 
IN 
THE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES MAKING MAKING THE SYSTEM FAIRER WHEN SO MUCH IS 
AT STAKE WON'T BE EASY GORDON 
BROWN FLIES BACK TO BRITAIN TODAY 
TO FACE GROWING CONCERN FROM HIS 
OWN PARTY ABOUT THE ABOLITION OF 
THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE WHICH WILL 
LEAVE SOME PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES 
WORSE OFF THE TREASURY SAYS IT IS 
NOT ABOUT TO CLIMB DOWN OVER THE 
CHANGE TO TAXES DESPITE THE 
COMMENT BY ANGELA EAGLE TO WATCH 
THIS SPACE 
AFTER A TRIP OVERSHADOWED BY THE 
VISIT OF THE POEM TO AMERICA 
GORDON BROWN IS HEADING BACK TO 
MORE TROUBLE AT HOME OVER THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN PENCE TAX BAND 
THE PRIME MINISTER HAD TO INTERRUPT 
HIS SCHEDULE ON THURSDAY IN ORDER 
TO PERSUADE ANGELA SMITH A 
MINISTERIAL AIDE NOT TO RESIGN OVER 
THE ISSUE NOW FIVE MORE AIDES 
HAVE PUBLICLY VOICED THEIR CONCERNS 
THE FEELING ON LABOUR'S BACKBENCHES 
IS ONE OF DEEP UNEASE EVERYTHING EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE'VE DONE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
IN TERMS OF TAX CHANGES CREDITS 
ANY OF THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN 
CONSISTENTLY WEIGHT IN THE FAVOUR 
OF THOSE ON LOWER INCOMES AND THIS 
RUNS TOTALLY COUNTER TO THAT IT 
STICKS OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB 
CRITICS SAY THE ABOLITION OF THE 
TEN PENCE TAX BAND MAKES FIFTY THREE 
MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WORSE OFF 
HOUSEHOLDS AT THE LOWER END OF THE 
INCOME SCALE THE OPPOSITION ARE 
ADDING TO THE WORRIES THE THE CRUMBLING OF GORDON BROWN'S 
AUTHORITY WE'RE SEEING AND 
GOVERNMENT WHICH IS FIGHTING EACH 
OTHER AT A TIME WHEN BRITISH 
FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES ARE VERY 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE ECONOMIC FUTURE 
AND ARE LOOKING FOR A STRONG 
GOVERNMENT THAT'S FIGHTING FOR 
BRITAIN RATHER THAN TURNING ON 
EACH OTHER 
BUT REPORTS THE 
TREASURY IS PLANNING A CLIMB DOWN 
HAVE BEEN DENIED WITH A SPOKESMAN 
TELLING THE B. B. C. THERE WAS NO 
IMMINENT CHANGE TO THE POLICY THE 
MESSAGE THAT IS LIKELY TO DEEPEN 
THE DISCOMFORT ON LABOUR'S 
BACKBENCHES BACKBENCHES THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS GOING TO PUT 
FIFTY BILLION OF FUNDING IN THE 
BANKING SYSTEM TO KICK START THE 
MORTGAGE MARKET THE MONEY WILL BE

GOVERNMENT BONDS WHICH CAN BE 
SWAPPED FOR MORTGAGES THE BANKS ARE 
FINDING HARD TO SELL ON THE CHAIR 
OF THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE 
JOHN MCFALL TOLD THE B. B. C. HE 
SUPPORTED THE PLAN 
I THINK IT IS 
SOMETHING THAT IS NECESSARY IF WE 
DON'T HAVE THIS WHAT THIS WILL 
MEAN S. THAT THE WHOLE MORTGAGE 
MARKET AND PERHAPS A REAL ECONOMY 
WILL FREEZE UP AND WILL SEE THE 
MORTGAGE MARKET HALFEN 
POLICE ARE 
TO CARRY OUT A SECOND CONTROLLED 
EXPLOSION THIS MORNING AT THE HOME 
OF A NINETEEN YEAR OLD MAN IN BRISTOL WHO 
WAS ARRESTED UNDER THE TERRORISM 
ACT ANDREW IBRAHIM'S HOME WAS 
SEALED SO FAR YESTERDAY AND 
RESIDENTS WERE EVACUATED WE'RE AT 
THE SCENE ANDY TELL US WHAT IS 
HAPPENING THERE THIS MORNING 
WE'RE EXPECTING THE BOMB DISPOSAL 
TEAM TO ARRIVE WITHIN THE NEXT HOUR 
TO START PLANNING THIS SECOND 
CONTROLLED EXPLOSION THE FIRST ONE 
WAS IN THE EARLY HOURS OF YESTERDAY 
MORNING WHEN POLICE FOUND WHAT 
THEY CALLED A SUSPECT CONTAINER 
THEY BROUGHT IT OUTSIDE THE 
PROPERTY IT WAS SURROUNDED WITH 
SANDBAGS AND DETONATORS AND WE'RE 
EXPECTING A SIMILAR PROTEST TO 
HAPPEN TODAY WHAT HAPPENED WAS 
YESTERDAY EXPERTS FROM THE KENT 
FORENSICS EXPLOSIVES LABORATORY 
WENT INTO THE PROPERTY THEY FOUND 
MORE SUSS SUSPICIOUS SUBSTANCES SO 
THEY CALLED IN THE BOMB DISPOSAL 
TEAM TO CARRY OUT THIS EXPLOSION 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT 
ZIMBABWE'S ELECTORAL COMMISSION 
WILL TODAY TO BEGIN A RECOUNT OF 
THE BALLOT PAPERS DESPITE THE 
RESULT NEVER HAVING BEEN MADE 
PUBLIC MORGAN TSVANGIRAI SAYS HE 
DEFEATED MUGABE OUTRIGHT IN THE 
FIRST ROUND AND WON'T TAKE PART IN 
ANY RUNOFF MEANWHILE A CHINESE 
SHIP CARRYING WEAPONS FOR ZIMBABWE 
APPEARS TO HAVE HEADED BACK TO SEA 
AFTER ANCHORED OFF DUR CAN DOCK 
WORKERS REFUSE TODAY UNLOAD THE 
SHIP POPE BENEDICT THE SIXTEENTH HAS CALLED 
FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO 
INTERVENE IF GOVERNMENT'S FAIL TO 
PROTECT THEIR PEOPLE FROM HUMAN 
RIGHTS ABUSES SPEAKING AT THE UN 
DURING HIS VISIT TO NEW YORK THE 
POPE SAID THE HARM CAME FROM 
INDIFFERENCE TO SUFFERING IT IS 
MORE THAN A YEAR THAN THE NAPOLI 
RAN AGROUND OFF DEVON WHAT WAS A 
DISASTER FOR THE SHIP PROVED TO BE 
A BONANZA FOR SCAVENGERS WHICH 
STOLE ITS CONTENTS NOW IT IS 
PROVIDING ANOTHER BONANZA WHICH IS 
SCRAP METAL IN BELFAST BADLY 
DAMAGED IN STORM THE NAPOLI WAS 
DELIBERATELY BEACHED TO STOP IT 
FROM SINKING MUCH OF ITS CARGO 
ENDED UP ON THE SHORE BARRELS AND 
CONTAINERS HOLDING EVERYTHING A 
THIRD OF THE SHIP STILL LIES OFF 
THE DEVON COAST BUT THE REST HAS 
BEEN TAKEN AWAY IT NOW LIES IN A 
DRY DOCK IN BELFAST WHERE BIT BY 
BIT IT IS SLOWLY PULLED APART 
THIS IS WHERE THE CARGO WAS ONCE 
HELD BUT THERE'S STILL MUCH OF 
REAL WORTH HERE TONNES AND TONNES 
OF STEEL CAPABLE OF BEING RECYCLED 
NOW WE HAVE ASSESSED THE SHIP 
DEALT WITH THE DECONTAMINATION 
PHASE WE'RE IN THE SCRAPPING PHASE 
THERE'S ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND TONNES OF 
SCRAP STEEL IN THE NAPOLI FORWARD 
SECTION THAT'S SENT OUT BY OUR 
LOCAL PORT HERE IN BELFAST TO STEEL 
MILLS IN EUROPE 
SOME OF THE STEEL 
WILL ALSO BE SENT TO CHINA IT WAS 
OF COURSE IN THIS SHIPYARD THE MOST 
FAMOUS DOOMED VESSEL OF THEM ALL 
THE TITANIC WAS BUILT BUT IT'S 
HERE AFTER ITS ILL FATED JOURNEY 
THE NAPOLI IS GETTING A NEW LEASE 
OF LIFE THAT'S BECAUSE MUCH OF THE 
STEEL TAKEN FROM THE VESSEL COULD 
END UP BEING USED IN SHIP BUILDING 
AGAIN THE NAPOLI WILL NEVER SAIL 
AGAIN BUT PARTS OF IT COULD RETURN 
TO THE SEAS 
AND THOSE ARE THE MAIN STORIES THIS 
MORNING TIME IS SEVEN TEN A M. NOW PUPILS 
ARE INCREASINGLY USING HARD LUCK 
TALES LIKE THE DEATH OF A PET OR 
HEADACHE TO WIN EXTRA MARKS IN 
THEIR EXAMS THESE ARE TWO OF THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH COULD SECURE 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATION FROM THE 
EXAMINERS THERE'S GROWING CONCERN 
SOME STUDENTS ARE TAKING UNFAIR 
ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM EARLIER ON 
BREAKFAST CHRIS HOWARD FROM THE 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HEAD 
TEACHERS WARNED THE SYSTEM COULD 
BE OPEN TO MISUSE TIFPLT CLEARLY 
DOES NEED A REVIEW I'M GLAD TO 
HEAR THE REGULATOR SAY THEY WILL 
LOOK MORE CLOSELY WHAT THEY'LL DO 
THE REWARD INSIDE IN TERMS OF 
MARKS THAT MIGHT BE GAINED FOR A 
VERY SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEM SUCH A 
TERMINAL ILLNESS ISN'T HUGELY 
DIFFERENT FROM THAT AWARDED FOR A 
HEADACHE OR A TEMPORARY BOUT OF 
HAY FEVER IT IS INTERESTING THE 
FIGURES ON THAT FOR THOSE WHO 
DON'T KNOW S. YOU CAN GET UP TO FIVE PER CENT 
INCREASE ON YOUR RESULT FOR A 
TERMINAL ILLNESS OF THE CANDIDATE 
THEMSELVES OR TERMINAL ILLNESS OR 
RECENT DEATH OF THE IMMEDIATE 
FAMILY THAT COMPARES WITH ONE PER CENT FOR 
SAYING YOU HAD A HEADACHE WELL WELL THAT'S IS WHAT DOES SEEM UNFAIR 
SCHOOLS WHEN THEY SEE THAT AT THE 
LOWER LEVELS OF PROBLEM IF THEY'RE 
ASKED TO SUPPORT A CLAIM THEY MAY 
PASS IT ON TO THE BOARD AND ASK THE 
BOARD TO REFEREE IT THEY'RE IN 
LIES THE PROBLEM L. WOULD BE FAR 
HAPPIER IF THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT 
COULD BE REWARDED WERE TIGHTENED UP 
AND IF THERE WAS GREATER EXTERNAL 
VERIFICATION NEEDED TO INDICATE THE 
PROBLEM WAS SIGNIFICANT AND WAS 
PROBABLY OF A MORE LONG STANDING 
NATURE 
WHICH OF THE CATEGORIES NATURE FOR YOU IS THE MOST CONCERNING YOU 
MENTIONED SOME OF THE TRIVIAL 
NATURE OF SOME ISSUES WHICH FOR 
YOU ARE THE ONES THAT STAND OUT 
LOOKING AT ALL THE THINGS THAT 
MIGHT GAIN YOU REWARD I THINK MOST 
OF THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE LISTED 
ARE REQUIRING ONE TO TWO PER CENT SUPPORT COULD BE 
SWEPT AWAY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND 
THEN ONE MIGHT CONCENTRATE ON 
THINGS WHICH ARE MORE SERIOUS 
ALOFT INTEREST FROM YOU ON THIS 
STORY JOE FROM LEEDS SAYS I USED 
THE SYSTEM LAST YEAR FOR TWO EXAMS 
I WAS SUFFERING FROM ACUTE CONJUDGE 
VIET TUS BUT I HAD AN OFFICIAL 
DOCTOR'S NOTE L. WAS CONTINUING TO 
MOP MY EYE WAS THAT FAIR 
CATHERINE EXMAILED IN THE BEAUTY 
OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS PEOPLE 
WITH LEARNING DIFFICULTIES ARE 
GIVEN CONSIDERATION TO ENABLE THEM 
TO ACHIEVE THE EXAM RESULTS 
ANOTHER ONE SAYING THERE WAS A 
BOMB SCARE AND WE STILL HAD TO SIT 
THE EXAM KEEP GETTING IN TOUCH 
WITH YOUR VIEWS THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS IN WALES ARE THE FIRST 
BIG TEST FOR THE COALITION 
GOVERNMENT IN THE WELSH ASSEMBLY OF 
LABOUR AND PLAID CYMRU WE WERE 
SPEAKING TO ALTHOUGH MAIN PARTIES 
THIS MORNING WE'RE JOINED BY 
BANGOR BY IEUAN WYN JONES A VERY 
GOOD MORNING TO YOU 
GOOD MORNING 
NOW LOOKING THROUGH 
SOME OF THE ISSUES YOU'RE TALKING 
ABOUT THIS INKNOW VAITS WHICH IS 
THE NAME YOU'RE GIVING SOME 
POLICIES PARTICULARLY WITH GREEN 
ISSUES 
SOME IDEAS ARE RADICAL YES YES SOME 
OF THEM ARE FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE IDEAS WE HAVE PARTICULARLY 
IN URBAN CENTRES AND CITY AREAS IS 
TO MOVE AWAY FROM DEPENDENCY ON 
CARS AND USE CYCLING IT IS NOT 
ONLY ABOUT THAT BUT CHANGING THE 
WAY WE HAVE PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
DELIVERED IN URBAN AREAS IN 
PARTICULAR THAT I THINK WILL MEAN 
WE CAN TAKE CARS AWAY FROM THE 
CENTRE GREEN THE AREA AND IT 
MEANS THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WORKING 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT CAN CHANGE THE 
WAY PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOUR WE'RE ALSO 
LOOKING AT FOR EXAMPLE SOME ISSUES 
AROUND PUBLIC HEALTH IN PARTICULAR 
MAKING IT CLEAR WE WANT HEALTHY 
LIVING AND MAKING IT CLEAR THE 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES WILL BE ABLE TO 
INVEST SO PEOPLE CAN HAVE 
HEALTHIER LIVING STYLES 
PARTICULARLY INVESTING IN 
ALLOTMENTS AND SOEN SOME THINGS 
YOU HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING YOUR 
PROGRAMMES WHICH SHOW PEOPLE ARE 
INTERESTED IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND 
PUBLIC HEALTH 
SOME OF THE IDEAS 
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT YOU'RE 
TALKING ABOUT GREEN ROOFS THIS IS 
INCORPORATING SOIL ON ROOFTOP 
GARDENS IS THAT RIGHT EXPLAIN 
THAT 
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WHAT THAT THAT MEANS IS WHENEVER WE USE MATERIALS 
FOR BUILDINGS NOW IT IS CRUCIAL WE 
LOOK AT SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS IF 
WE CAN TO IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT 
ALL THE TIME IF YOU CAN HAVE GREEN 
ROOFS PARTICULARLY ON PUBLIC 
BUILDINGS AND OF COURSE ON 
PRIVATE DWELLINGS IF IT IS 
APPROPRIATE THEN IT MEANS YOU LOSE 
SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS AND YOU CAN 
INVEST IN PROTECTING THE 
ENVIRONMENT 
IT IS CLEAR FROM THE ENVIRONMENT PLEDGES YOU'RE MAKING IN CONNECTION 
WITH THE ENVIRONMENT YOU THINK 
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE 
WHAFPLT MAKES YOU THINK THEY'RE AS 
INTERESTED IN THINGS LIKE CYCLE 
SHARING AND URBAN ISSUES AS THEY 
ARE WITH THEIR DAY TO DAY LIVES 
DELIVERING CORE SERVICES IS 
IMPORTANT BUT I THINK PEOPLE ARE 
BECOMING MORE AWARE NOW OF THE NEED 
TO RECYCLE THEY NEED TO TAKE 
DECISIONS IN THEIR LIVES WHICH 
IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT THE 
FEEDBACK WE HAVE BEEN GETTING FROM 
PEOPLE ON THE DOORSTEP THESE ARE 
THE KIND OF ISSUES THEY WOULD LIKE 
TO SEE LOCAL COUNCILS GETTING STUCK 
INTO THERE HAS BEEN TENDANCY IN 
THE PAST FOR LOCAL COUNCILS TO HAVE 
THIS CULTURE TO HAVE BUSINESS AS 
USUAL I THINK WE WANT TO INJECT A 
BIT OF EXCITEMENT INTO THIS 
CAMPAIGN SO PEOPLE FEEL IT IS WORTH 
GOING OUT TO VOTE ON FIRST MAY ONE ONE THING PEOPLE GET ANNOYED ABOUT IS 
BOW ROCK CASY ARE YOU CONFIDENT 
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DELIVER THESE 
THINGS YOU ARE DELIVERING IT IT DEPENDS ON THE LEADERSHIP THE 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES WILL HAVE AFTER 
THE FIRST MAY L. BELIEVE NOW LOOKING 
AT WHAT WE ARE OFFERING HERE 
WORKING POSSIBLY WITH OTHER PARTIES 
IN SOME AREAS THERE IS A CULTURE 
OF PEOPLE READY TO WORK TOGETHER IN 
WALES WE CAN DELIVER SOME OF THESE 
PROJECTS BRICKING IN A NUISANCE OF 
PURPOSE AND DIRECTION 
THANK YOU 
FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING THANK THANK YOU 
YOU ARE WATCHING BREAKFAST YOU HERE ARE OUR HEADLINES CLAIMS THAT 
PUSHY PARENTS ARE EXPLOITING THE 
EXAM SYSTEM TEACHERS CALL FOR 
STRICTER RULES AS THOUSANDS OF 
PUPILS ARE GIVEN MORE TIME AND 
EXTRA MARKS THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT 
IS NOT BUDGING ON THE ABOLITION OF 
THE TEN P. INCOME TAX RATE DESPITE 
CONCERNS OF SOME LABOUR M. P.'S AND 
STILL TO COME ON THE PROGRAMME 
OPEN SESAME 
I HAD TO JUST YOU 
KNOW BREAK DOWN THAT DOOR TO GET 
THEM TO HIRE ME 
WHY DID JODIE 
FOSTER HAVE PROBLEMS WITH HER NEW 
MOVIE THE HOLLYWOOD STAR REVEALS 
ALL IN AN EXCLUSIVE B. B. C. INTERVIEW 
GOOD MORNING WELL WE HAVE THAT 
COLD EASTERLY WIND WITH US AGAIN F. 
YOU ARE OUT AND ABOUT THIS MORNING 
YOU WILL NOTICE IT WILL FEEL ON THE 
CHILLY SIDE WINDS COULD GUST THIRTY TO FORTY 
MILES PER HOUR IT WILL KNOCK THE 
EDGE OFF THE TEMPERATURES THE RAIN 
WILL BE LIGHT FOR MOST AREAS TO 
THE NORTH OF LONDON FOR EAST ANGLIA 
AND THE MIDLANDS IT IS A DRY START 
TO THE MORNING MORNING SUNSHINE 
FOR NORTH WEST ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND 
A TOUCH OF FROST IN THE WESTERN 
HIGHLANDS AT THE MOMENT NORTHERN 
IRELAND STARTING OFF BRIGHT WITH 
SOME SUNNY SPELLS IT WILL STAY DRY 
AND SUNNY HERE MORE CLOUDY IN 
WALES WITH SPITHS AND SPOTS OF RAIN 
FOR THE REST OF SATURDAY MORNING 
THAT BAND OF RAIN WILL WORK FURTHER 
NORTH A FEW SPOTS WORKING INTO THE 
MIDLANDS THROUGH THE MIDDLE PART OF 
THE DAY A LOT OF CLOUD LEFT OVER 
FOR SUNDAY AS WELL STILL WITH THAT 
COLD EASTERLY WIND TO THE NORTH 
AND THE WEST OF THE U. K. IT SHOULD BE 
DRY AND BRIGHT WITH SUNNY SPELLS 
YOU WANT TO MOVE HOUSE BUT YOU ARE 
WORRIED ABOUT THE COST OF A NEW 
MORTGAGE WHAT DO YOU DO MAYBE GET 
THE BUILDERS IN IT IS A SURE WAY 
TO ADD VALUE ACCEPT IF THEY ARE 
NOT UP TO THE JOB WE WASTE SEVEN HUNDRED 
MILLION ON HOME IMPROVEMENTS 
CARRIED OUT BY COWBOY BUILDERS 
THEY SAY IT IS TIME LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES STAMPED OUT ROGUE 
TRADERS IT IS NOT THE LATEST IN 
INDUSTRIAL CHIC IT IS A BUILDING 
JOB WHICH HAS GONE WRONG WHEN RAY 
STOCKS WANTED THIS EXTENSION HE DID 
NOT JUST PICK A FIRM AT RANDOM BUT 
USED ONE RECOMMENDED BY HIS 
ARCHITECT THE WORK HAS NOT BEEN 
DONE PROPERLY DESPITE THAT THE 
BUILDERS HAVE SAID THEY ARE NOT 
COMING BACK 
THIS EXPERIENCE HAS 
LEFT ME DISAPPOINTED L. FEEL HAVING 
DONE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HOMEWORK 
IT IS STILL FRAUGHT WITH DANGER 
ONCE THEY HAVE TKWOT YOUR GOT 
YOUR MONEY THEN YOU ARE IN THE LAP 
OF THE GODS F. THEY ARE NICE THEY 
WILL DO WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO 
DO IF NOT YOU HAVE NO RECOURSE 
UNTIL EVERYTHING HAS BEEN DONE THE 
COUNCIL WILL NOT SIGN IT OFF AND 
GIVE RAY THE CERTIFICATE HE NEEDS 
WITHOUT IT THOUSANDS OF POUNDS 
COULD BE KNOCKED OFFER THE VALUE OF 
HIS HOME THE PROBLEM OF DODGEY 
BUILDERS HAS BEEN AROUND FOR MANY 
YEARS IT IS GETTING WORSE TRADING 
STANDARDS SAY IT IS TIME COUNCILS 
TRACK DOWN ON BUILDERS WHO RIP US 
OFF 
ESSIENTY MATE THE COST IS SEVEN HUNDRED OFF MILLION A YEAR THAT IS RISING 
BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS 
WE ARE GETTING LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
NEED TO PUT IT AT THE TOP OF THEIR 
PRIORITYS TO GET ROGUE TRADERS OUT 
OF BUSINESS 
IT WOULD MEAN A BOMB 
IN HOME IMPROVEMENTS 
THE STATE OF 
THE HOUSING MARKET CURRENTLY MEANS 
THAT PERHAPS MORE PEOPLE ARE 
LOOKING TO IMPROVE THE HOME THEY 
HAVE GOT RATHER THAN LOOKING TO BUY 
ANOTHER ONE AND IT MEANS THAT THEY 
ARE LOOKING TO DO BIGGER HOME 
IMPROVEMENTS BUT WHEN WE SURVEYED 
WHICH READERS WE FOUND FORTY PER CENT HAD 
SOME KIND OF PROBLEM WHEN THEY HAD 
WORK DONE ON THEIR HOUSE 
MANY OF 
US FIND IT HARD TO KNOW WHAT WE 
SHOULD PAY FOR A JOB TOO LITTLE 
AND YOU COULD HIRE A COWBOY TOO 
MUCH AND YOU MAY BE RIPPED OFF WE 
RANG THREE FIRMS OF BUILDERS AND 
ASKED THEM TO QUOTE FOR A CONSURVEY 
TORY WE GAVE THEM EXACT DETAILS OF 
HOW LARGE WE WANTED IT THE 
MATERIALS AND THE STYLE WE LIKED 
THIS IS WHAT WE WERE QUOTED 
THEY WANTED TO BE FRONT CASH IN 
HAND THE TRADE BODY SAYS PAYING IN 
CASH IS A BAD IDEA 
PROBABLY PEOPLE 
WANT TO MAKE SHORT CUTS TAKE ON 
COWBOY BUILDERS AVOID VAT F. YOU 
WANT TO MAINTAIN THE VALUE OF YOUR 
PROPERTY GET A PROFESSIONAL BUILDER 
IN 
UNTIL IS A CRACKDOWN GETTING IN SOMEONE IN TO DO IMPROVEMENTS COULD 
BE A LOTTERY THE ONLY PERSON 
GUARANTEEED TO HIT THE JACKPOT IS 
THE BUILDER 
AS USUAL WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM 
YOU IF YOU HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH 
BUILDERS EVERYBODY HAS GOT A STORY 
HAVEN'T THEY JUST 
ALL BUILDERS OUT 
THERE WHO ARE GOOD AT THE JOB ARE 
SAYING IT IS UNFAIR 
AND IF YOU ARE OUT THERE GET IN 
TOUCH WITH US IF YOU HAVE 
QUESTIONS TO KRISTIAN DIGBY 
PRESENTER OF TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY

WHO ARE IN FACT PERFECTLY FIT TO 
WORK LET'S START WITH THAT STORY 
INTEREST FL THE TELEGRAPH PEOPLE PEOPLE SAY WE ARE TALKING OURSELVES INTO A 
RECESSION NOW THE FACTS ARE 
STARTING TO COME THROUGH THIS IS A 
SIGNIFICANT STORY THEY ARE TALKING 
ABOUT HOW DISCOUNT STORES LOW 
PRICED HOTELS REPORT A BOMB IN 
SALES THEY TALK ABOUT 
SIGNIFICANT FIGURES FIFTY SEVEN PER CENT OF 
CONSUMERS ARE TRIMMING THEIR 
SPENDING BECAUSE THEY ARE UNSURE OF 
THEIR FINANCES SIXTEEN PER CENT HAVE BEEN PUT 
OFF HOME IMPROVEMENTS FIFTEEN PER CENT HAVE 
DELAYED A FAMILY HOLIDAY L. THINK 
SOME FIGURES ARE COMING THROUGH NOW 
UNDERPINNING THESE THEORIES AND 
FEARS THAT THE ECONOMY IS ROCKING 
I THINK PEOPLE THEY TALK ABOUT 
THEMSELVES AND IN YOUR OWN HOME 
DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE 
WHETHER YOU GO OUT TO DINER OR USE 
UP EVERYTHING IN THE FRIDGE A LOT 
OF PEOPLE THINK MAYBE IT IS NOT 
SUCH BAD THING SOMETIMES IT CAN 
I KNOW IT IS NOT NICE IF IT IS 
ROUGH AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE 
SUFFERING BUT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE 
SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIKE TO 
CONCENTRATE THEIR MIND BIT 
I RUN 
A SMALL BUSINESS L. SHOCKED US HOW 
BANKS WERE TRYING TO LEND US MONEY 
WE DON'T NEED IT PEOPLE HAVE FOUND 
CREDIT TO EASY NOW IT HAS COME BACK 
TO HAUNT US 
IT CAN BE REFRESHING 
TO SAY NO TO THINGS SOMETIMES 
A DIFFICULT TIME FOR THE PRIME 
MINISTER TO FACE A REBELLION OVER

AMERICA HE WAS GETTING VERY 
IRRITATED WITH THE CONSTANT 
DOMESTIC ISSUES WHICH WERE 
INTERRUPTING THE PRESS CONFERENCES 
I FELT WHEN HE WAS STANDING THERE 
WAS BUSH AND ONE OF THE SENIOR 
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENTS STARTED TO 
ASK HIM ABOUT DOMESTIC POLICIES 
UNCOMFORTABLE FOR HIM UMED THAT IRRITATION 
IT DOES NOT COME ACROSS IRRITATION WELL DOMESTICLY PEOPLE THINK WHY 
SHOULDN'T YOU ANSWER THOSE 
QUESTIONS 
HE IS NOT NATURAL WITH QUESTIONS IT HE IS NOT NATURAL UNLESS HE HAS 
REHEARSED IT HE IS FEELING 
UNCOMFORTABLE IN HIS SKIN HE NEEDS 
SUPPORT AT THE MOMENT WHEN YOU 
HAVE M. P.'S LIKE FRANK FIELD 
YESTERDAY HAVING A GO AND SAYING 
THERE IS A REAL REBELLION GROWING 
AMONG LABOUR RANKS THAT IS NOT 
HELPING HIM 
A STORY IN THE DAILY 
MAIL ABOUT BREAST CANCER SCREENING 
AND EXTENDING IT TO OLDER WOMEN 
WHAT A FANTASTIC STORY WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT BREAST SCREENING NOW 
ENCOURAGING OVER SEVENTIES TO HAVE BREAST 
SCREENING PEOPLE ARE WRITTEN OFF 
WHEN THEY ARE OLDER PEOPLE WHEN 
YOUNGER ARE ENCOURAGED TO HAVE 
REGULAR TESTS THEY SHOW HERE IN 
HOLLAND THEY HAVE HAD REGULAR TESTS 
FOR SEVENTY TO SEVENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT 
THEY HAVE CUT CANCER BY THIRTY PER CENT AMONG 
THE OLDEST PEOPLE 
HOW IS IT 
TREATED HERE 
WE SORT OF IGNORE IT 
WE ENCOURAGE BETWEEN WHEN THEY 
REACH FIVE HUNDRED EIGHT TO HAVE REGULAR TESTS BUT 
OVER ZERO SEVENTY YOU HAVE TO ASK OLDER 
PEOPLE ARE RELUCTANT WHEN YOU 
THINK ELDERLY PEOPLE HAVE WORKED 
ALL THEIR LIVES THEY DESERVE THE 
BEST CARE WHEN THEY ARE OLDER THEY 
SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED 
ANOTHER STORY

DRIVERS WHO LEAVE THEIR ENGINES

GOOD MORNING THIS IS BREAKFAST 
WITH SUSANNA REID AND CHARLIE STAYT 
OUR MAIN STORIES THIS MORNING 
PUSHY PARENTS ARE ACCUSED OF 
EXPLOITING THE EXAM SYSTEM THAT 
AWARDS EXTRA TIME AND MARKS TO SOME 
PUPILS LAST YEAR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PUPILS 
USED A FAMILY CRISIS OR CONDITIONS 
FROM A HEADACHE AND DYSLEXIA AS 
REASON TO GET SPECIAL TREATMENT 
THE NUT SAY THE SYSTEM IS OPEN TO 
ABUSE AND IT IS CALLING FOR A 
PROPER CODE OF PRACTICE 
MY SENSE 
IS THAT TEACHERS TRY TO DO THE BEST 
FOR THEIR YOUNGSTERS BUT THEY ALSO 
UNDERSTAND THAT SOME FAIRLY TRIVIAL 
PROBLEMS ARE BEING REWARDED INSIDE 
THE SYSTEM AND HAVING SEEN ONE 
YOUNGSTER BENEFIT THEY WILL THEN 
USE THE SYSTEM TO GET THE BEST FOR 
OTHER YOUNGSTERS AS WILL PARENTS 
THE SYSTEM IT IS THE SYSTEM THAT 
NEEDS LOOKING AT IT CLEARLY DOES 
NEED A REVIEW I'M GLAD TO HEAR THE 
REGULATOR SAY THEY WILL LOOK MORE 
CLOSELY WHAT IS HAPPENING

THERE'S FIRST TIME FOR HIM TO

HIGHEST SCORE EVER IN T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT 
FROM SEVENTY THREE BALLS AND KOLKATA KNIGHT 
RIDERS FROM IN CRUISE CONTROL 
CHASING TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THREE TO WIN WAS ALWAYS GOING 
TO BE AN UPHILL STRUGGLE FOR 
BANGALORE EVEN CAPTAIN DRAVID 
DIDN'T HANG AROUND FOR LONG FROM 
THAT POINT ON THE ROYAL 
CHALLENGERS NEVER CHALLENGED ALL 
OUT FOR EIGHTY TWO 
FITTINGLY IT WAS MCCULLUM WHO TOOK 
THE FINAL CATCH HE'S THE FIRST 
STAR OF THE I. P. L. HE WON'T BE THE 
LAST M. THE TWO MOST POPULAR SPORTS 
ARE CRICKET AND ENGLISH PREMIER 
LEAGUE IT IS THAT WHERE A SLIPPUP 
CAN BE DECISIVE NO ONE IS 
EXPECTING MANCHESTER UNITED TO FALL 
NOW THEY WILL RETAIN THE TITLE 
NEXT WEEK F. THEY CAN REESTABLISH 
THE LEAD BY WINNING AT BLACKBURN 
IT IS NOT THE EASIEST PLACE TO GO 
TO WE WON THERE LAST SEASON L. 
DON'T NECESSARILY IT IS A BAD 
RECORD IT IS NOT A GREAT RECORD 
BUT OTHER CLUBS HAVE FOUND IT 
DIFFICULT THERE ARE LOT OF 
PLACES FOR US TOMORROWEL L. HAVE A 
STRONG SQUAD L. CAN'T GO THROUGH IN 
A BETTER TIME TO BE HONEST IF I'M 
TAKING BUNCH OF PLAYERS UP TO BLACKBURN THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME 
JUST THREE POINTS ABOVE THE DROP 
ZOP ARE READING THEY GO TO ARSENAL 
ON THREE OR FOUR OCCASIONS THIS 
YEAR WE'VE HAD SIGNIFICANT GAMES 
OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE'VE PERHAPS 
THOUGHT WE SHOULD WIN AND WE 
HAVEN'T WE JUST HAVEN'T PLAYED

CELTIC CAN GO ABOVE RANGERS IF 
THEY WIN THE GERS WHO ARE IN CUP 
ACTION SEMI FINAL ACTION TOMORROW 
WOULD STILL BE TITLE FAVOURITES 
BUT CELTIC ARE AT LEAST MAKING 
CONTEST OF T. 
THE MAIN AIM IS TO WIN 
EVERY GAME TRY TO KEEP AS POSITIVE 
AS POSSIBLY YOU CAN BE OBVIOUSLY 
WE'RE ROOTING FOR A FAVOUR FROM 
OTHER TEAMS BUT ALL WE CAN DO IS 
PUT ENOUGH PRESSURE ON RANGERS TO 
TRY AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM 
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY STILL IN THE 
DRIVING SEAT BY A LONG WAY IN IN RUGBY UNION LEINSTER MISSED THE 
CHANCE TO WRAP UP THE MAGNERS 
LEAGUE LAST NIGHT THEY NEED ADD 
BONUS POINT TO WIN AWAY BUT THEY 
LOST LEINSTER HAD SEEN PLENTY OF 
THE BALL BUT WERE UNABLE TO CONVERT 
EARLY PRESSURE INTO TRIES INSTEAD 
THE HOME SIDE SCORED THE OPENER

TRY BUT THEY MISSED THE CHANCE TO 
SNATCH A LATE VICTORY WHEN THEY

NOW IT IS TIME FOR NEWS WATCH THIS 
WEEK CHANGE OF STORY 
WELCOME TO NEWS WATCH THIS WEEK 
DID THE B. B. C. CAVE INTO PRESSURE FROM 
A CLIMATE CHANGE LOBBYIST WHAT IS 
IN A NAME 
IN THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS B. B. C. 
REPORTER HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF 
BENDING TO PRESSURE FROM A CAMPAIGN 
GROUP THE REPORT WAS BASED ON AN 
INTERVIEW WITH THE HEAD OF THE 
WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORGANISATION 
WHO SAID WORLD TEMPERATURES WERE 
LIKELY TO DROP IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IT CLAIMS 
THAT THE STORY WAS CHANGED TO TAKE 
OUT REFERENCES WHICH MIGHT PROVIDE 
AMMUNITION FOR THOSE SCEPTICAL 
ABOUT MAN MADE GLOBAL WARMING ONE 
ALTERATION EMPATHISED THAT DESPITE 
A DROP IN TEMPERATURES THIS YEAR 
EXPERTS SAY WE ARE STILL IN LONG 
TERM WARMING TREND LET'S LOOK AT 
THE E. MAILS AVAILABLE ON THE WEB 
UNDER HEADING UBJECT CEX DEMANDED THE CORRESPONDENT SAID 
LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE READ THAT 
AMONG THEM THIS ONE 
THAT E. MAIL EXCHANGE IS THAT WHAT 
HAPPENED 
IT IS PART OF A BROADER HAPPENED ACCOUNT I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE ON 
THAT ISSUE OF SENSORSHIP THERE WAS 
NO WAY THAT ARTICLE WAS SENSORED 
JO ABBESS IN A LATER POSTING SAID 
SHE WAS UNHAPPY WITH THE CHANGES I 
MADE SHE DIDN'T THINK THE ARTICLE 
SUITED HER PARTICULAR ACCOUNT 
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF STUFF ON 
THE WEB SUGGESTING I SENSORED A 
LINE TOOK OUT A LINE SAYING 
CLIMATE SCEPTICS WERE SEIZING ON 
THIS PIECE OF EVIDENCE TO CONFIRM 
THEIR EVIDENCE THAT THE CLIMATE WAS 
NOT CHANGING L. DID NOT TAKE THAT 
AT ALL 
WHY DID YOU CHANGE THE 
STORY 
I CHANGED IT BECAUSE I WAS STORY NOT HAPPY WITH IT L. HAD A NUMBER 
OF PEOPLE CONTACTING ME INCLUDING 
JO ABBESS AND THE WORLD 
METEOROLOGICAL ORGANISATION WHO 
SAID ALTHOUGH THEY FELT MY INITIAL 
ACCOUNT WAS ACCURATE IT WAS 
MISLEADING BECAUSE THE HEADLINE 
SAID THAT CLIMATE WAS COOLING THE 
WMO SAID THAT CLIMATE WILL COOL 
THIS YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BUT WE ARE IN A 
LONG TERM COOLING TREND SO THEY 
FELT THAT AND THE GENERAL TENURE OF 
THE STORY WERE MISLEADING WHEN I 
SAW THE VARIOUS COMPLAINTS FROM A 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE I THOUGHT ACTUALLY 
THAT IS FAIR ENOUGH ONE OF THE 
GREAT THINGS ABOUT WORKING ON LINE 
IS IF YOU DO SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT 
THE BEST PIECE OF WORK YOU CAN 
CHANGE IT THERE WERE OTHER 
QUESTIONS WHICH COULD CHANGE IT 
WAS CHANGED TO IMPROVE IT MOST 
PEOPLE WHO SAW IT WOULD AGREE IT 
WAS IMPROVED 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
UPSET PEOPLE THE MOST THE FACT 
YOU MADE THE CHANGE OR DIDN'T TELL 
PEOPLE A CHANGE HAD BEEN MADE WHEN 
WEBSITES ARE CHANGED ALBEIT FOR 
GOOD REASON SHOULD PEOPLE BE 
INVOLVED INFORMED 
IT HAS FROM 
MANY PEOPLE'S POINT OF VIEW L. HAVE 
HAD A LOT OF CORRESPONDENCE OVER 
THIS FROM BOTH SIDES A LOT OF 
PEOPLE ARE SAYING NOT MANY PEOPLE 
ARE SAYING THEY ARE UNHAPPY WITH 
THE REVISEED STORY WHAT THEY SAY 
THEY ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT IS I BACKED 
DOWN UNDER PRESSURE WHICH IS NOT 
TRUE AND THE OTHER THING IS THIS 
THING ABOUT THE DATE STAMP WHICH 
IS SOMETHING I DIDN'T KNOW BEFORE 
IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF A WEB 
COMMUNITY WHAT IS VERY IMPORTANT 
IS THE DATE STAMP ON THE PIECE THE 
TIME STAMP WHICH SHOWS WHETHER OR 
NOT IT HAS BEEN ALTERED IN THIS 
CASE WE ALTERED IT PIECEMEAL L. WAS 
AWAY FROM THE OFFICE I ALTERED IT 
A COUPLE OF TIMES BY TELEPHONE ON 
LINE TO THE NEWS DESK WE DIDN'T 
THINK IT WAS NECESSARY TO CHANGE 
THE TIME STAMP WITH HINDSIGHT IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD IDEA WE 
DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT AT THE TIME 
THE B. B. C. IS PLACING GREAT EMPHASIS 
ON INTERACTING THE AUDIENCE DID 
YOU GET YOUR FINGERS BURNT HERE 
WILL YOU BE MORE CAUTIOUS IN THE 
FUTURE 
IT IS STILL IMPORTANT THAT FUTURE WE ARE FUNDED BY THE LICENSE FEE 
PAYER A LOT OF OUR CRITICS CAME 
FROM AMERICA AND AUSTRALIA WHERE 
THIS PLAYS INTO A NARRATIVE OF THE 
B. B. C. AND HOW THAT PLACES AGAINST 
LIBTARIAN VIEWS AND CLIMATE CHANGE 
ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF L. TRIED TO 
ANSWER AS MANY AS I COULD WE OUGHT

TEACHERS CALL FOR STRICTER RULES AS 
THOUSANDS OF PUPILS ARE GIVEN MORE

GOOD MORNING IT IS THE NINETEENTH APRIL 
ALSO TODAY TAXING TIMES FOR GORDON 
BROWN THE PRIME MINISTER FLIES 
HOME FROM AMERICA TO A GROWING ROW 
OVER ABOLISHING THE TEN P. RATE 
POLICE PLAN A SECOND CONTROLLED 
EXPLOSION IN BRISTOL AFTER 
ARRESTING A TEENAGER ON SUSPICION 
OF TERRORISM 
THE HOME IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD 
LEAVE A HOLE IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT 
TRADING STANDARDS SAY THAT WE ARE 
RIPPED OFF TO THE TUNE OF SEVEN HUNDRED 
MILLION LAST YEAR WE WERE 
FACE TO FACE FOR WORLD CHAMPION JOE 
CALZAGHE AS HE GETS READY TO GO 
TOE TO TOE IN LAS VEGAS TONIGHT 
WELL AND TRULY SNOOKERED IT AT 
THE WORLD CHAMPION AHEAD OF THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS THAT START 
TODAY TODAY THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF 
MANIPULATING SCHOOL ADMISSIONS AND 
DOING COURSEWORK FOR THEIR CHILDREN 
NOW PUSHY PARENT AND ACCUSED OF 
EXPLOITING THE EXAM SYSTEM WHICH 
AWARDS EXTRA TIME AND MARKS TO SOME 
PUPILS PUSHY PARENTS ARE ACCUSED 
REASONS RANGING FROM A DOMESTIC 
CRISIS OR A HEADACHE TO CONDITIONS 
LIKE DYSLEXIA AND DIABETES WERE 
GIVEN TO GET SPECIAL TREATMENT THE 
NUT SAYS THAT THE SYSTEM IS OPEN TO 
ABUSE AND IS CALLING FOR A PROPER 
CODE OF PRACTICE 
REVISING FOR A LEVELS THAT WILL 
FORM THEIR FUTURES HERE AT LUTON 
SIXTH FORM COLLEGE MORE STUDENTS 
THAN EVER OF ARE GIVEN THE SUPPORT 
OF EXTRA TIME IN EXAMS OR UNDER 
THE WATCHFUL EYE OF THEIR EXAMS 
MANAGER 
STUDENTS ARE MORE AWARE MANAGER STAFF ARE CERTAINLY MORE AWARE 
THAT THERE ARE STUDENTS WITH 
DIFFICULTIES WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING 
FORWARD WITH THINGS LIKE ASPERGER'S 
AUTISM WE WOULD NEVER HAVE SEEN 
THAT TWO YEARS AGO 
THE SYSTEM 
HELPS STUDENTS LIKE RACHEL WHO HAS 
A MOBILITY PROBLEM 
IN THE COLLEGE 
AND ALLOW TO SIT THE EXAMS IN A 
SEPARATE ROOM MEANING I CAN 
STRETCH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EXAM 
SCHOOLS CAN AWARD STUDENT UP TO TWENTY FIVE 
PER CENT EXTRA TIME IF THEY HAVE SPECIAL 
EDUCATIONAL ISSUES SUCH AS DYSLEXIA 
OR ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY 
DISORDER LAST YEAR THE NUMBER OF 
PUPILS GRANTED EXTRA TIME IN 
ENGLAND INCREASED BY TWENTY TWO PER CENT 
AFTER EXAMS PUPILS CAN APPEAL FOR 
EXAM BOARDS FOR EXTRA MARKS 
APPEAL TO THEY CAN GET FIVE PER CENT 
INCREASE FOR SERIOUS DOMESTIC 
CRISIS THREE PER CENT FOR DIABETES OR ASTHMA 
AND ONE PER CENT FOR A HEADACHE THESE 
REQUESTS ARE ALSO ON THE RISE AND 
LAST YEAR ONLY THREE OUT OF EVERY 
ONE HUNDRED WERE TURNED DOWN 
THE NUT THINKS THE CURRENT SYSTEM 
IS OPEN TO ABUSE ESPECIALLY IN 
INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS 
THE OCCASIONAL 
PUSHY PARENT WILL PUT TEACHERS 
UNDER PRESSURE WHAT THEY NEED I 
THINK IS THE CURRENT GUIDANCE 
BOILED DOWN L. THINK HAVING A 
PROPER CODE OF PRACTICE WHICH 
TEACHERS CAN ACTUALLY SHOWED TO 
PARENTS AND SAY THIS IS THE 
GUIDANCE THIS HAS BEEN WORKED OUT 
WITH SCHOOLS WE HAVE BEEN 
CONSULTED IT IS ENTIRELY 
REASONABLE AND THAT IS AS FAR AS I 
CAN GO 
EXAM SEASON IS ALREADY 
UNDER WAY HERE WITH HIS TEXTILE 
EXAM GOING ON BEHIND ME IT IS A 
TIME OF HUGE STRESS PRESSURE AND 
EXPECTATION FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR 
PARENTS THAT IS WHY SOME IT MAY 
TRY TO GAIN SOME EXTRA ADVANTAGE AT 
THIS CRITICAL TIME 
I HAVE MET 
PARENTS WHO PUT THEIR CHILDREN 
FORWARD FOR EXTRA THINGS SAY THEY 
HAVE DYSLEXIA AND THINGS WHEN THEY 
DON'T REALLY 
IT IS NOT FAIR AT ALL 
I REALLY DON'T THINK IT IS FAIR 
EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE AN EQUAL 
FOOTING 
ANY BENEFITS ARE FOOTING ADVANTAGES THAT YOU CAN SQUEEZE OUT 
YOU MAY AS WELL GO FOR IT OR 
ADVANTAGES 
THE EXAMS REGULATOR IS ADVANTAGES CONCERNED AND WILL MONITOR THE 
SITUATION CLOSELY THIS SUMMER THE THE WE ARE WORKING WITH THE EXAM BOARDS 
WHO RUN THE EXAMS TO TRY TO LOOK 
MORE CLOSELY THIS YEAR INTO THE 
REASONS FOR THESE CANDIDATES ASKING 
FOR EXTRA TIME AND PARTICULARLY 
WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE SCHOOLS AND 
COLLEGES 
MAKING THE SYSTEM FAIRER COLLEGES WHEN SO MUCH IS AT STAKE WILL NOT 
BE EASY 
WE WILL BE PUTTING SOME OF THE E. 
MAILS AND TEXTS TO THE CAMPAIGN FOR 
REAL EDUCATION ABOUT THIS IN TEN 
MINUTES NUMBERS ON THE SCREEN NOW 
LOTS OF YOU GETTING IN TOUCH THIS 
MORNING MORNING GORDON BROWN FLIES BACK TO BRITAIN 
TODAY TO FACE GROWING CONCERN FROM 
HIS OWN PARTY ABOUT THE ABOLITION 
OF THE TEN P. TAX RATE WHICH WILL 
LEAVE SOME PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES 
WORSE OFF THE TREASURY SAYS IT IS 
NOT ABOUT TO CLIMB DOWN OVER THE 
CHANGED TAXES DESPITE A COMMENT BY 
THE JUNIOR TREASURY MINISTER ANGELA 
EAGLE TO WATCH THIS SPACE 
AFTER A TRIP OVERSHADOWED BY THE 
VISIT OF THE POPE TO AMERICA 
GORDON BROWN IS HEADING BACK TO 
MORE TROUBLE AT HOME OVER THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. TAX BAND THE 
PRIME MINISTER HAD TO INTERRUPT HIS 
SCHEDULE ON THURSDAY IN ORDER TO 
PERSUADE ANGELA SMITH A 
MINISTERIAL AIDE NOT TO RESIGN 
OVER THE ISSUE NOW FIVE MORE AIDES 
HAVE PUBLICLY VOICED THEIR CONCERNS 
THE FEELING ON LABOUR'S 
BACKBENCHERS IS ONE OF DEEP UNEASE 
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE HAVE DONE 
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN IN TERMS OF TAX CHANGES 
CREDITS EVERYTHING HAVE BEEN 
CONSISTENTLY WEIGHTED IN FAVOUR OF 
THOSE ON LOWER INCOMES THIS RUNS 
TOTALLY COUNTER TO THAT IT SORT OF 
STICKS OUT LIKE SORE THUMB 
CRITICS SAY THE ABOLITION OF THE 
TEN P. TAX BAND MAKES FIFTY THREE MILLION 
HOUSEHOLDS WORSE OFF HOUSEHOLDS AT 
THE LOWER END OF THE INCOME SCALE 
THE OPPOSITION ADDING TO THE 
GOVERNMENT'S WORRIES 
WE ARE SEEING 
THE CRUMBLING OF GORDON BROWN'S 
AUTHORITY AND A GOVERNMENT WHICH IS 
FIGHTING EACH OTHER AT A TIME WHEN 
BRITISH FAMILIES AND BRITISH 
BUSINESSES ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT 
THE ECONOMIC FUTURE AND ARE LOOKING 
FOR A STRONG GOVERNMENT THAT IS 
FIGHTING FOR BRITAIN RATHER THAN 
TURNING ON EACH OTHER 
REPORTS THAT 
THE TREASURY IS PLANNING A 
CLIMBDOWN HAVE BEEN DENIED A 
SPOKESMAN TOLD THE B. B. C. THERE WAS NO 
IMMINENT CHANGE TO THE POLICY THIS

DISCOMFORT FROM LABOUR'S 
BACKBENCHERS BACKBENCHERS THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS GOING TO PUT 
FIFTY BILLION OF FUNDING INTO OUR 
BANKING SYSTEM TO HELP KICK START 
THE MORTGAGE MARKET THE MONEY WILL 
BE OFFERED TO BANKS ARE SHORT TERM 
GOVERNMENT BONDS WHICH CAN BE 
SWAPPED FOR BUNDLES OF MORTGAGES 
WHICH THE BANKS ARE HAVING PROBLEMS 
SELLING ON 
OPPOSITION PARTIES ARE LIKELY TO 
ACCUSE THE GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO 
SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH CREATIVE 
ACCOUNTING BUT THE CHAIR OF THE 
TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE LABOUR 
M. P. JOHN MCFALL TOLD US HE 
SUPPORTED THE PLAN 
I THINK IT IS 
SOMETHING THAT IS NECESSARY IF WE 
DON'T HAVE THIS WHAT THIS WILL 
MEAN IS THAT THE WHOLE MORTGAGE 
MARKET AND PERHAPS THE WHOLE 
ECONOMY WILL FREEZE UP WE WILL 
SEE THE MORTGAGE MARKET HALF 
POLICE WILL RRY OUT A SECOND 
CONTROLLED EXPLOSION THIS MORNING

BY U. S. WARPLANES WHICH DID THE SAME 
THEY BOMBED THE SAME AREA OF LAND 
IN WHAT A BRITISH MILITARY 
SPOKESMAN DESCRIBED IT AS SHOW OF FORCE 
IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS A FORCE SORT OF WARNING SHOT WHAT MIGHT 
FOLLOW 
THE BRITISH MILITARY IN FOLLOW THE PAST HAVE USED THE SHOWS OF 
FORCE AND THEIR WORDS AS THEY 
PUT IT TO TELL THE MILITIA MEN 
THAT THEY ARE BACKING UP THE IRAQI 
ARMY ESSENTIALLY THESE OPERATIONS 
THAT ONGOING IN BASRA ARE ABOUT THE 
IRAQI ARMY TAKING ON SHI'ITE 
MILITIA MEN TRYING TO GET THE 
WEAPONS FROM THEM THAT IS LIKELY 
TO CONTINUE THE REPORT WE HAD IN 
THE PAST FEW MINUTES FROM LOCAL 
RESIDENTS IS THAT IT IS PRETTY 
QUIET BUT THERE HAS BEEN GUNFIRE 
IN THE AREA OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS 
THANK YOU 
IT FEATURES HUNDREDS OF ART WORKS 
PREVIOUSLY HIDDEN FROM VIEW THE 
WORLD'S FIRST GALLERY DEDICATED TO 
BOTANICAL ART OPENS TODAY IT WILL 
SHOW WORKS FROM TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TWO ARTISTS FROM 
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AT THE ROYAL 
BOTANICAL GARDENS IN KEW 
THIS IS NOT JUST A PRETTY PICTURE 
IT IS THE ONLY SURVIVING RECORD OF 
A NOW ENDANGERED SPECIES LIKE ALL 
THE ARTWORK HE AT KEW GARDENS THIS 
ILLUSTRATION WILL APPEAL TO ART 
LOVERS AS WELL AS SCIENTISTS 
ARTWORK HERE THESE PAINTINGS SEEN 
FOR THE FIRST TIME CHART THE 
BOTANICAL ART MOVEMENT FROM THE 
FIFTEENTH CENTURY TO THE MODERN DAY 
MOST OF THESE ARTWORKS HE HAD BEEN 
KEPT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS FOR 
HUNDREDS OF YEARS SEEN ONLY BY 
FEW AVID COLLECTORS NOW THEY CAN 
BE ENJOYED BY MORE THAN MILLION 
PEOPLE WHO COME TO KEW GARDENS 
EVERY YEAR THIS BIRD OF PARADISE 
FLOWER IS A TECHNICAL MASTERPIECE 
AS WELL AS A WORK OF ART IT IS BY 
AN AUSTRIAN PAINTER HIS 
MICROSCOPIC STUDIES OF PLANTS ARE 
HIGHLY PRIZED BY BOTANISTS AND ART 
COLLECTORS WHOSE MICROSCOPIC 
STUDIES THESE PICTURES GIVE A 
FASCINATING GLIMPSE OF BRITAIN'S 
COLONIAL PAST 
THIS IS AN 
INTERESTING EXAMPLE OF A WORK BY AN 
UNKNOWN INDIAN ARTIST THAT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN PAINTED FOR A PERSON 
WORKING FOR THE EAST INDIA COMPANY 
OFTEN PEOPLE WORKING FOR 
ORGANISATIONS LIKE THAT OR IN THE 
MILITARY WOULD PAY LOCAL ARTISTS 
WHILE THEY WERE IN INDIA CHINA ETC 
TO DRAW THE LOCAL FLORA AND FAUNA 
THEN THEY WOULD BRING THESE 
PICTURES BACK AND THEY WOULD BE 
USED TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THESE 
PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT GREW IN 
EXOTIC PLACES 
WITH A QUARTER OF 
THE WORLD'S FLOWERING PLANTS 
THREATENED BY EXTINCTION IN THE 
NEXT FIFTY YEARS THIS ART COLLECTION 
IS ALSO A VITAL CHAPTER OF NATURAL 
HISTORY THIS COLLECTION IS ON LOAN 
FROM SHIRLEY SHERWOOD A BOTANIST 
AND ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST 
PROLIFIC COLLECTORS OF THIS KIND OF 
ART DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE GREAT 
SECRET ART COLLECTIONS OF BRITAIN 
FINALLY IT HAS A HOME WHERE THE 
PUBLIC CAN ENJOY IT 
THOSE ARE THE MAIN STORIES THIS 
MORNING MORNING THOUSANDS OF PUPILS ARE PLEADING 
FOR EXTRA TIME AND EXTRA MARKS IN 
THEIR EXAMS WITH REASONS RAGING 
FROM DYSLEXIA TO DYER BEATTIES A 
FAMILY CRISIS AND EVEN A HEADACHE 
DIABETES 
TEACHING UNIONS ARE WARNING THAT 
THE SYSTEM IS OPEN TO ABUSE ARE 
THE FEARS JUSTIFIED KATIE IVENS IS 
FROM THE CAMPAIGN FOR REAL 
EDUCATION GOOD MORNING LOTS OF 
THESE ISSUES PEOPLE WILL 
UNDERSTAND IF A CHILD HAS DYSLEXIA 
AND NEEDS MORE TIME BUT PROBLEM 
AREAS SEEM TO BE IN THE LOWER 
CATEGORIES YOU CAN GET A ONE PER CENT AT 
GREAT IN YOUR RESULT IF AFTER THE 
EXAM YOU SAY THAT MY SON OR 
DAUGHTER HAD A HEADACHE 
THAT IS 
CLEARLY UNFAIR IT IS VERY EASY TO 
MAKE IT PAYS FOR YOUR CHILD BEING 
DISADVANTAGED BY NOT FEELING WELL 
THAT DAY MAYBE THE GOLDFISH DIED 
THE DAY BEFORE WHATEVER CLEARLY 
IT FAVOURS PARENTS WHO ARE 
ARTICULATE AND LITERATE AGAINST 
THOSE WHO ARE NOT PERHAPS EITHER SO 
QUICK ON THE UPTAKE OR SO WELL ABLE 
TO MAKE A CASE FOR THE CHILD IF 
THE ONE TO RESTORE FAIRNESS AND 
EXAM SHOULD BE FAIR BECAUSE WHAT 
THEY SHOULD TEST IS THE CHILDREN'S 
KNOWLEDGE AND ABILITY TO DO THE 
EXAMS UNDER EXAM CONDITIONS WHICH 
ARE DESIGNED TO BE FAIR FOR ALL 
WANT TO DO STOP THAT YOU WILL 
INVITE CERTAINLY USE OF MAKING A 
CASE FOR YOUR CHILD BUT ALSO 
PERHAPS ABUSE OF THE HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF POLICE THAT ARE MADE 
IT IS FAIR TO ASSUME THAT SOME 
PROPORTION OF THOSE MAY CONSTITUTE 
ABUSE 
I SUPPOSE THERE IS A DANGER ABUSE THAT IF THERE IS A SYSTEM THERE 
AND SOME PARENTS MIGHT BE TAKING 
ADVANTAGE OF IT OTHER PARENTS 
MIGHT THINK THERE IS AN ADVANTAGE 
TO BE GAINED AND I DON'T WANT TO BE 
LEFT OUT 
ABSOLUTELY THEY WOULD 
THE WHOLE THING ESCALATES L. 
REMEMBER WHEN MY SON WAS DOING HIS 
GCSES HE WAS IN HOSPITAL WITH AN 
ASTHMA ATTACK VERY SEVERE ASTHMA 
AND HIS DOCTORS PREPARED HIM FOR 
THE EXAM AND SAID YOU HAVE TO GET 
YOUR EXAM WE NEVER PLEADED THAT HE 
WAS SUFFERING FROM ASTHMA HE JOLLY 
WELL DID HIS EXAM 
THAT IS NOT THE 
ANSWER IS IT TO TAKE AWAY THE 
SYSTEM ALTOGETHER OTHER YOU DID 
NOT PLEAD ON BEHALF OF YOUR SON 
THERE WOULD BE A VERY GOOD CASE FOR 
HAVING DONE SO 
PERHAPS IN VERY 
SEVERE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT I THINK 
YOU HAVE A SYSTEM WHICH INCLUDES 
THINGS LIKE HEADACHES OR FEELING A 
BIT UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS 
CLEARLY NOT JUSTIFIED 
IN THIS ONE PER CENT AREA ILLNESS OF ANOTHER 
CANDIDATE IN THE EXAMINATION ROOM 
APPLIES IF SOMEONE IS 
COUGHING A 
LOT EVERYONE COULD SAY WE SHOULD 
ALL GET A ONE PER CENT UPGRADE THAT IS 
LUDICROUS I AM A 
PARENT I 
DID NOT LUDICROUS KNOW 
THESE CATEGORIES EXISTED I 
THOUGHT IF 
YOU 
APPROACH THE 
AND 
SAY THERE HAD 
BEEN DEATH IN 
A 
FAMILY IT 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN 
INTO ACCOUNT 
THE DO NOW TO 
ANSWER ASKED 
THE QUESTION 
IF 
YOUR CHILD 
HAS UPSET 
YOUR CHILD HAS UPSET BY SOMETHING WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT IT PRESUMABLY 
YOU WILL USE THE SYSTEM THE EXAM 
IS CHAV 
DESIGNED TO 
TEST YOUR 
CHILD UNDER 
A RANGE 
OF CONDITIONS 
WE ALL HAVE TO BE TESTED THERE 
SEEMED TO 
BEAT TWO ISSUES ONE IS 
THAT YOU ACTUALLY AGREE THAT ANY OF 
THESE ILLNESSES CONDITIONS FAMILY 
AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS 
EXTRA TIME 
AND EXTRA MARKS 
AND THE 
OTHER IS THAT 
IT IS 
PARENTS MAKING 
THESE 
THINGS UP 
IN ORDER TO 
GAIN AN 
ADVANTAGE 
THERE ARE 
TWO DIFFERENT 
ADVANTAGE THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT 
BOTH I 
THINK I 
AM CONCERNED ABOUT 
BOTH AND 
I THINK IT SHOULD BE 
SCRAPPED TO BE FAIR IT WILL 
ALWAYS FAVOUR 
THE ARTICULATE 
I DO NOT 
WANT TO 
USE THE TERM 
PUSHY PARENT 
BECAUSE IT MALIGNS 
PUSHY PARENT BECAUSE IT MALIGNS PARENTS WHO WANT THE BEST FOR THEIR 
CHILDREN 
HERE IS AN E. MAIL DAWN CHILDREN GETS IN TOUCH AND SAID 
MY DAUGHTER 
HEARD 
I GOT 
CANCER BEFORE HER EXAMS 
LAST YEAR

WAY THEY 
PERFORMING 
WELL BE 
AFFECTED BY WHAT 
IS 
GOING ON IT IS 
A SLIPPERY 
SLOPE 
IS GOING ON IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO 
DEFINE 
THE 
ONLY WAY 
IS TO 
MAKE 
IT THE 
SAME 
CONDITIONS FOR ALL 
YOU CAN ALWAYS 
RESIT AN EXAM SOME CHILDREN MAY BE 
DISADVANTAGED GENUINELY BY 
CIRCUMSTANCES 
JUST A COUPLE OF E. CIRCUMSTANCES MAILS HOW CAN YOU COMPARE TYPE ONE 
DIABETES WITH HAVING A HEADACHE 
TYPE 
ONE DIABETES IS 
A CRY 
THREATENING CONDITION 
WHICH IS VERY 
DIFFICULT TO MANAGE SHE WOULD 
WORRY THAT HER SON HAD A CONDITION 
WHICH WOULD 
AFFECT JEREZ CONDITION 
WHICH WOULD AFFECT JEREZ CONDITION ANOTHER VIEWER SAID SHE HAD TYPE 
DIABETES AND 
DID NOT 
FEEL IT 
WOULD 
GIVE ANY NEED 
FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT 
GIVE ANY NEED FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT MY SON GOT ALL 
EIGHT GRADES FOR 
HIS 
EXAMS WHEN YOU ARE A DISADVANTAGE

THEM THE INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE 
WHICH THREATENS TO SHAKE CRICKET TO 
ITS CORE STARTED IN SPECTACULAR 
STYLE ON AND OFF THE PITCH THE 
MULTI MILLION POUND VENTURE BEGAN 
IN BANGALORE WITH MUSEUM'S BRENDON 
MCCULLUM GETTING THE HIGHEST TOTAL 
MADE IN ANY FORM OF T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY 
CRICKET ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT NOT OUT FROM ONLY SEVENTY THREE 
BALLS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT IN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE OVERS MORE 
THAN TWO PER BOUGHT KOLKATA KNIGHT 
RIDERS RAN OUT EASY WINNERS IN THE 
END AGAINST THE BANGALORE ROYAL 
CHALLENGERS CHALLENGERS CRICKET BUT NOT AS WE KNOW IT THE 
INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE HAS BEEN 
BILLED AS THE TOURNAMENT THAT COULD 
CHANGE THE SPORT FOREVER THIS IS 
NOT THE INTRODUCTION THEY GET AT 
LORD'S IT HAD ALL THE PROMISED 
RAZZMATAZZ AND TWO HOURS BEFORE THE 
START THE MUSIC WAS BLARING AND 
THE CROWD TURNED UP TO SEE IT 
FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND PACKED INTO THE STADIUM AND 
WERE IN FOR A TREAT DANCING TIGERS 
STILT WALKERS GOLD AND 
CHEERLEADERS AND THEN THE ARRIVAL 
OF THE POWER RANGERS THE TOP STARS 
ARE EARNING FOOTBALLERS' WAGERS FOR 
SIX WEEKS BUT IT WAS THE LESSER 
PLAYERS LIKE BRENDON MCCULLUM WHO 
STOLE THE SHOW IT WAS NOT JUST 
SPECIAL BUT SPECTACULAR HE WAS 
EVERY PART THE SWASHBUCKLING 
BOLLYWOOD HERO THE RECORDS WERE 
TUMBLING AS WELL THE HIGHEST 
SCORE EVER IN T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT FROM SEVENTY THREE 
BALLS THE KOLKATA KNIGHT RIDERS 
WERE IN CRUISE CONTROL CHASING TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THREE 
TO WIN WOULD ALWAYS BE AN UPHILL 
STRUGGLE FOR BANGALORE WITH EVEN 
THE CAPTAIN RAHUL DRAVID NOT 
HANGING AROUND FOR LONG FROM THAT 
POINT ON IN THE SECOND OVER THE 
BANGALORE ROYAL CHALLENGERS NEVER 
THREATENED FITTINGLY IT WAS 
BRENDON MCCULLUM WHO TOOK THE FINAL 
CATCH HE IS THE FIRST STAR OF THE 
I. P. L. BUT WILL NOT BE THE LAST 
THE TWO MOST POPULAR SPORTS IN 
INDIA ARE CRICKET OBVIOUSLY AND 
THE ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE IT IS 
THAT TIME IN THE SEASON WAYS THE 
BOOK CAN BE SO DECISIVE NO ONE 
EXPECTS MANCHESTER UNITED FOR NOW 
THEY WILL RETAIN THE TITLE PERHAPS 
AT CHELSEA NEXT WEEK IF THEY CAN 
RE ESTABLISH THEIR FIVE POINT LEAD 
BY WINNING AT BLACKBURN TODAY 
QUITE A FEW TEAMS HAVE FOUND IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO GO THERE WE WON THERE 
LAST SEASON L. DON'T NECESSARILY 
SAY IT IS BAD RECORD IT IS NOT 
GREAT RECORD BUT OTHER CLUBS HAVE 
FOUND IT DIFFICULT IT IS 
DIFFICULT PLACE TO GO TO THERE ARE 
LOTS OF POSITIVE PRESS TOMORROW L. 
HAVE STRONG SQUAD EIGHTEEN THAT IS 
CONSISTENTLY PERFORMING WELL 
COULDN'T GO IN AT BETTER TIME TO 
BE HONEST I'M TAKING A BUNCH OF 
PLAYERS UP TO BLACKBURN AND THIS IS 
THE RIGHT TIME 
LIVERPOOL HAVE DEFENDED THEIR 
DECISION TO FIELD A WEAKENED SIDE 
ARE STRUGGLING FULHAM WITH ONE EYE 
OF COURSE ON THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE 
EVEN IF THAT UPSETS BOLTON BOLTON 
ARE LOOKING TO ESCAPE THE BOTTOM 
THREE AT MIDDLESBROUGH JUST THREE 
POINTS ABOVE THE DROP ZONE ARE 
READING PERHAPS IT BACK INTO 
TROUBLE THEY GO TO ARSENAL TODAY 
WHO HAVE SLIPPED BACK 
WE HAVE 
HAD SIGNIFICANT GAINS AND 
OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE PERHAPS 
THOUGHT WE SHOULD WIN AND WE HAVE 
NOT WE JUST HAVE NOT PERFORMED 
SIGNIFICANT GAMES SOME OF OUR BEST 
RESULTS HAVE BEEN WHERE THERE HAS 
BEEN LITTLE EXPECTATION L. AM 
HOPING THAT WILL BE THE CASE THIS 
SATURDAY 
YOU CAN SEE MORE OF THAT SATURDAY INTERVIEW ON FOOTBALL FOCUS ON B. B. C. 
ONE AT TWELVE TEN P. M. AFTER THEIR INJURY 
TIME WIN IN THE OLD FIRM DERBY ON 
WEDNESDAY CELTIC CAN GO BACK TOP 
ABOVE RANGERS AND THE S. P. L. TODAY 
AFTER THEY WIN AT HOME TO ABERDEEN 
RANGERS WHO LIE IN CUP SEMI FINAL 
TOMORROW WOULD BE TITLE FAVOURITES 
WITH THREE GAMES IN HAND THEN BUT 
CELTIC WOULD AT LEAST MAKE A 
CONTEST OF IT WHO ARE IN CUP 
SEMI FINAL ACTION 
WE'RE KEEPING AS 
POSITIVE AS WE POSSIBLY CAN 
OBVIOUSLY WE NEED A FAVOUR FROM 
SOME OTHER TEAMS BUT ALL WE CAN DO 
IS PUT ENOUGH PRESSURE ON RANGERS 
TO TRY TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR 
THEM THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY STILL IN 
THE DRIVING SEAT BY A LONG WAY IT IT REALLY IS A GREAT WEEKEND OF SPORT

LONDON 
WHEN THE TEN P. RATE OF TAX WAS 
ABOLISHED IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHAT 
WOULD HAPPEN IT COULD LEAD MANY 
PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES WORSE OFF 
THERE IS TALK OF A COMPENSATION 
SCHEME THE TREASURY SAYS IT HAS NO 
PLANS TO CHANGE ITS POLICY GOOD 
MORNING JUST EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE 
THIS HAS ALREADY HAPPENED 
PARLIAMENT HAS YET TO VOTE ON IT 
THEY HAVE VOTED ONCE WAS THAT THERE 
WAS A BUDGET IN MARCH AT THE END 
OF THE BUDGET DEBATE PARLIAMENT 
VOTES THROUGH EVERYTHING IT WANTS 
MOST LABOUR M. P.'S VOTED FOR IT FOR 
IT IT HAS TO START ON SIXTH APRIL 
WOULD BE TAX YEAR THERE IS A HUGE 
FAT FINANCE BILL WHICH GOES 
THROUGH PARLIAMENT OF WHICH IS 
LOOKED AT CLAUSE BY CLAUSE IF IT 
IS NOT PASSED ALL THIS CLAUSE IS 
NOT PASSED IT WILL STOP THEY HAVE 
GOT TO VOTE ON IT TO KEEP IT GOING 
THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW IT HAS STARTED 
ARE THE PEOPLE IT AFFECTS THESE THESE ARE PEOPLE WITH AN INCOME BELOW 
FIFTEEN THOUSAND OR SIXTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR WHO 
CANNOT GET TAX CREDIT THEY WILL 
FIND THEIR TAX IS APT TO THREE A WEEK 
OR FOUR A WEEK HIGHER THAN IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN OR HIGHER THAN IT WAS 
LAST YEAR 
THAT DOES NOT SOUND MUCH 
BUT IT IS AT THE MARGINS YOU ARE 
AT THAT LEVEL WHERE THE 
DISCREPANCIES REALLY CAN MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE 
THE BIGGEST LOSERS ARE DIFFERENCE THE ONES ON SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE A YEAR THEY 
WILL LOSE THREE A WEEK THAT IS A LOT 
OF MONEY OUT OF AN INCOME OF WHAT 
IS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY A WEEK 
IT IS NOT 
GOING TO BE REVERSED WHAT IS FRANK 
FIELD SUGGESTING SHOULD BE DOWN 
YOU HAVE GOT RID OF THE LOWER RATE 
AND YOU HAVE CUT THE BASIC RATE 
THAT IS WHY PEOPLE ABOVE THOSE 
LEVELS AGAIN THEY HAVE GAINED TWO HUNDRED 
OR THREE HUNDRED YEAR WHAT FRANK FIELD IS 
SAYING IS DO NOT SCRAP IT THAT 
WOULD COST BILLIONS OF POUNDS HE 
WANTS THE REVENUE TO IDENTIFY THE 
PEOPLE AND THESE ON THESE LOW 
INCOMES WHAT THE REVENUE SAID TO 
ME YESTERDAY IS AT THE END OF THE 
TAX YEAR WE MIGHT KNOW WHO THESE 
PEOPLE ARE BUT THEY COULD NOT 
COMPENSATE THEM THIS WEEK OR THIS 
MONTH THEY WOULD HAVE TO WAIT 
UNTIL SUMMER TWO THOUSAND NINE THAT IS A BIT 
TRICKY OTHERS ARE SAYING DO NOT 
LET THE REVENUE DO IT AUTOMATICALLY 
LET PEOPLE CLAIM THEY CAN PUT IN 
AN APPLICATION AND GET THE MONEY 
BACK THE TREASURY HAS NOT GIVEN 
ANY INDICATION IT IS LOOKING AT 
THIS EXCEPT AS YOU HAVE BEEN

BUT THEN 
THE 
SIDE 
OF ME 
SAYS HOLD 
ON 
REALLY SETTING A BAD 
EXAMPLE TO 
YOUR 
CHILDREN BUT WHAT 
IS SETTING 
A BAD CHILDREN 
THE ABUSE IF YOUR GRANDPARENT DIES 
IT IS SOMETHING 
THAT WOULD 
HAVE 
ACT ON YOUR CHILD AND 
SCHOOL

KNOW 
AND 
TELL YOU 
ABOUT IT 
THING WHEN YOUR CHILD COMES HOME AND

UNFAIR THAT THE

DO HAVE 
LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO ASK FOR 
THAT INDEED 
INDEED INDEED L. L. MEAN MOST SERIOUS 
CONDITIONS LIKE DIABETES OR DYSLEXIA
