ASPIRATIONS OF TEENAGERS HAVE CHANGED 
HANG ON LET ME GET THE GIRLS OUT 
IN A RECENT SURVEY OF GIRLS AGED FIFTEEN TO NINETEEN ALMOST TWO THIRDS ADMITTED 
THAT GLAMOUR MODELLING IS THEIR DREAM JOB 
I JUST WANT THIS SO MUCH AND I DON'T WANNA GO HOME 
BUT IT'S A CUT THROAT INDUSTRY 
IF WE WERE SELLING ARMPITS THAT WOULD BE THE SHOT 
AND ONLY A FEW MAKE IT TO THE TOP 
NO POINT IN STARTING UNLESS THE HAIR AND MAKE UP'S PERFECT 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTY YEARS 
GLAMOUR AGENCY SAMANTHA BOND MANAGEMENT 
OPENS ITS DOORS TO REVEAL THE TEARS 
SOME STUFF THEY SAID I WAS SO GOOD 
YOU ARE AND YOU ARE GOOD 
THE TANTRUMS 
YOU'VE BEEN IN THE SPORT WITH YOUR CLOTHES ON 
DON'T PUT ME DOWN COS I'VE DONE TOPLESS IN NUTS 
AND THE PRESSURES 
THEY SAID THAT I WAS FAT SUPPOSEDLY 
THIS IS LIFE AS A GLAMOUR GIRL 
MODELLING'S NOT AS GLAMOROUS AS PEOPLE THINK IT IS 
COMING UP AMANDA LAYS DOWN THE LAW DIVA STYLE 
THERE'S NO POINT IN STARTING UNLESS THE HAIR AND MAKE UP'S DONE PERFECT 
WILL YOUNGEST GIRL ON THE BOOKS ELLA PASS HER PAGE THREE TEST 
I WANNA BE A BIT MORE OF A HOUSEHOLD NAME THAN JUST A SEX SYMBOL 
THERE'S CONFUSION OVER THE TALENTS OF ONE OF SAM'S GIRLS 
SHE'S ACTUALLY A DANCER NO NOT THAT TYPE DANCER A PROPER DANCER 
IN CENTRAL LONDON ELLA COLE ARRIVES FOR A TEST SHOOT 
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD ELLA LIVES WITH HER PARENTS IN WALES 
SHE RECENTLY GAVE UP HER FASHION MODELLING CAREER 
DUE TO THE PRESSURES TO STAY STICK THIN AND IS NOW PURSUING GLAMOUR 
WHEN I WAS ABOUT FOURTEEN AS WE KNEW HER THEN JORDAN 
YOU KNOW SHE WAS LIKE MY IDOL 
TWO WEEKS AGO THE AGENTS CALLED IN THE YOUNGEST GIRL ON THEIR BOOKS 
THEY NEEDED TO BE SURE SHE WAS READY FOR THE GLAMOUR INDUSTRY 
I CAME OUT OF IT REALLY COS OF THE PRESSURES THAT ARE ON YOU 
BECAUSE THEY WANTED YOU SO THIN THEY WANT YOU SO THIN YEAH 
WELL JUST LET'S TURN THAT BLUE OFF THEN AND WE'LL LEAVE PINK ON ONE SIDE AND JUST 
SUN PHOTOGRAPHER ALISON WEBSTER WILL BE TESTING ELLA IN LINGERIE 
SHE CAN'T LEGALLY MODEL TOPLESS UNTIL SHE TURNS EIGHTEEN IN THREE MONTHS' TIME 
EVERY GLAMOUR GIRL DREAMS OF BECOMING FAMOUS 
AND A REGULAR SPOT IN A BEST SELLING TABLOID IS A WAY OF ESTABLISHING A NAME FOR A NEW GIRL LIKE ELLA 
MY BIGGEST DREAM AND ASPIRATION PROBABLY JUST TO REALLY TRY AND MAKE 
IT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE IN THE GLAMOUR INDUSTRY DOING AS MUCH AS I CAN 
AND THERE'S LIMITS TO WHAT I WOULD DO BUT 
LADS MAGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW SO YEAH JUST SORT OF 
BEING A BIT MORE OF A HOUSEHOLD NAME THAN JUST A SEX SYMBOL 
BUT BEING HIRED AND FIRED FOR YOUR SEX APPEAL CAN BE TOUGH ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE ONLY SEVENTEEN 
IT'S REALLY NERVE RACKING 
THE THING THAT I'M PROBABLY MOST SELF CONSCIOUS ABOUT 
IT CAN BE ANYTHING REALLY FROM WHAT YOUR HAIR LOOKS LIKE TO THE 
SIZE OF YOUR BACKSIDE TO THE SIZE OF YOUR LEGS 
COME ON THEN LET'S GO 
WHEN I GET OUT I FEEL LIKE A DIFFERENT PERSON 
IT'S LIKE YOU PUT ON A DIFFERENT PERSONA 
STRETCH O. K. 
JUST MOVE AROUND A LITTLE BIT DARLING 
MOVE YOUR ARMS UP TO YOUR WAIST 
AND BRING YOUR HAIR JUST ONTO YOUR SHOULDERS 
NORMALLY WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT HARDENED NIPPLES BUT WE DON'T IN YOUR CASE 
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS GET A NICE CURVE INTO YOUR WAIST SO JUST USING YOUR HIPS THAT'S LOVELY 
JUST TRY A LITTLE SMILE DARLING 
ELLA'S GOT A LOT TO LEARN YET AND SHE'S STILL ONLY SEVENTEEN YOU KNOW 
SHE HASN'T REALLY GOT ANY HIPS AT THE MOMENT SHE'S STILL A BABY 
JUST PUT YOUR ELBOW A BIT WIDER DARLING 
GOOD THAT'S IT 
O. K. RELAX YOU CAN GET YOUR CLOTHES ON NOW 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE GIRLS AFTER A SHOOT TO TRY AND GET TO SEE THEIR OWN PICTURES BECAUSE THAT 
SHOWS THEM HOW THEY CAN USE THEIR BODY TO ACHIEVE THE RIGHT CURVES OR WHERE THAT PIZZA WENT FOR LUNCH 
I MEAN WHAT ABOUT BODY WISE 
I MEAN I GET TOLD 
WHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU IS I WOULD BUY A HULA HOOP 
BUT A PROPER ONE AND DO A WHOLE LOAD OF WAIST STUFF TO JUST DEFINE HERE YOU KNOW 
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO TIGHTEN THAT IN AND YOUR TUMMY M. M. M. H. M. M. DEFINITELY 
AND THE REST I CAN'T TELL 
YOU'VE GOT LOVELY LONG LEGS AND EVERYTHING YOUR FACE IS BEAUTIFUL 
DO YOU THINK I NEED TO LOSE ANY OR JUST TONE IT'S IMPORTANT 
MORE IMPORTANT TO TONE AND ONCE YOU'RE TONED THEN YOU'D BE ABLE TO TELL IF YOU NEEDED TO LOSE WEIGHT 
IT'S NOT YOU ARE NOT OVERWEIGHT ARE YOU AT ALL 
I GOT TOLD TO TONE UP BUT YOU KNOW IT DOES TAKE TIME 
AND DEDICATION IF YOU WANT TO BE IN THIS INDUSTRY TO YOUR OWN BODY 
THERE'S STILL THAT SORT OF THING THAT YOU SHOULD REALLY LOOK 
AFTER YOURSELF STILL AN EXPECTATION ON YOU TO LIKE LOOK AFTER YOURSELF 
SO YOU KNOW IT'S ALL PART OF THE JOB REALLY 
IN A HOTEL NEAR HEATHROW SAM BOND'S MOST FAMOUS PAGE THREE MODELS KATIE DOWNES AND RHIAN SUGDEN 
ARE AT AUTOGRAPHICA AN ANNUAL EVENT WHERE FANS OF ALL KINDS COME TO MEET THEIR IDOLS 
DURING THEIR PAGE THREE SHOOT IN TENERIFE FOUR WEEKS AGO 
THE GIRLS GOT A TASTE OF BEING OGLED FACE TO FACE BY MALE ONLOOKERS 
COME ON THEN RHI LET'S GET OUT COME ON 
OH HELL HAVEN'T YOU EVER SEEN A NAKED WOMAN 
BUT TODAY IT'S THEIR JOB TO BE SLIGHTLY MORE FRIENDLY TO THEIR ADMIRERS

NO IT'S NOT WE'RE THE YOUNG TOTTY 
IT'S LIKE A BIT OF A ROLE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY SO 
YOU MIGHT MEET INTERESTING PEOPLE

I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THE FUNNY SIDE OF IT AND 
YOU KNOW YOU GET PAID TO DO IT SO YOU CAN'T REALLY COMPLAIN CAN YOU 
IMAGINE IF SOMEONE WAS TALKING TO YOU HAVE YOU GOT THE KEYS YEAH 
DESPITE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THE FANS KATIE AND RHIAN WILL EACH 
EARN A FIVE HUNDRED FEE BY LIVING UP TO THEIR GLAMOUR STAR STATUS 
JUST SIGNATURE OR 
WILL YOU SIGN IT TO BARRY 
A TOPLESS ONE OF ME

WORTH A TRY EVERY TIME 
I WONDER WHAT PEOPLE THINK WHEN THEY LOOK AT YOUR PICTURE

LAST WEEK HE GOT AMANDA A SPOT ON A LOCAL RADIO SHOW TO CREATE SOME HYPE 
YOU WERE GREAT HOW GOOD IS SHE 
TODAY'S PHOTOS ARE AIMED AT THE NEW AMERICAN MAXIM CALENDAR 
BUT THERE'S ALREADY A PROBLEM THE MAKEUP ARTIST IS RUNNING LATE 
I DUNNO CAN YOU DO IT ON YOUR OWN OR NO CAN'T DO HAIR 
IF WE'RE SUBMITTING FOR MAXIM MAGAZINE IT HAS TO LOOK AMAZING 
I DON'T KNOW 
THERE'S NO POINT STARTING UNLESS THE HAIR AND MAKE UP'S PERFECT 
OR IT'S NOT WORTH IT 
ROCK DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH LONGER IT'LL BE 
SHE'S UP THE STREET SHE'S FINISHING HER LAST GIRL 
I'M GUESSING TEN MINUTES FIFTEEN MINUTES 
WE'RE TRYING TO DECIDE IF WE SHOULD GET STARTED WITHOUT HER OR 
I THINK SO GET SOME STUFF ON GET SOME STUFF DONE OUT HERE 
I'M NOT SHOOTING WITH NO MAKE UP AND HAIR THEN YOU CAN'T GET STARTED 
THERE'S NO POINT COS FOR A MAXIM CALENDAR NO CHANCE 
NO WAY 
AFTER ANOTHER FORTY FIVE MINUTES WITH NO SIGN OF THE MAKE UP ARTIST 
THE FIRST LOCATION ENDS UP BEING THE HOTEL BAR 
WELL I'LL BE AROUND HERE FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS 
I NEED A SHOT OF SOMETHING 
CHEERS ANNA TIFFANY YOUR MAKE UP ARTIST 
HIYA 
THE MAKEUP ARTIST EVENTUALLY ARRIVES BUT THERE'S ANOTHER HITCH 
NICE TO MEET YOU 
I THINK AFTER INITIAL HAIR AND MAKE UP IT WOULD BE NICE 
IF YOU STAYED TO DO THE TOUCH UPS AND STUFF BUT IF YOU HAVE TO GO 
THE INITIAL HAIR AND MAKE UP MIGHT BE ONLY HALF HOUR TO AN HOUR RIGHT 
OH YOU DON'T DO HAIR I MEAN I DO HAIR BUT I DIDN'T BRING ANY OH 
COS YEAH SHE'S GOING TO NEED HAIR 
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING WITH YOU IN YOUR CAR 
NOT AT ALL 
NOTHING AT ALL TO DO HAIR NO TONGS NO ROLLERS 
ROCK KNOWS HE'S MESSED UP AND NEEDS TO THINK FAST 
YOU GUYS CAN GO AND SHE CAN START YOUR MAKE UP I'LL GO AND GET THE STUFF YOU NEED FOR YOUR HAIR 
WHILE SHE'S DOING YOUR FACE I'LL RUN ROUND HERE THERE'S A WAL MART HERE 
I'LL GET YOU A DRYER AND WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED 
I WOULD JUST NEED A CURLING IRON AND SOME SPRAY 
AFTER INVESTING TWO THOUSAND TO BE HERE AMANDA IS PUTTING ALL HER FAITH IN ROCK 
SOMETHING LIKE A SERUM 
NONE OF THE SIXTY FIVE MODELS HE REPRESENTS HAS BECOME A MAJOR SUCCESS SO FAR 
BUT HE'S TOLD AMANDA SHE COULD BE A STAR 
SO I'LL GO WITH THE BREAD I'LL GRAB WHAT YOU NEED AND I'LL COME BACK 
WHAT REALLY INTRIGUED US ABOUT AMANDA WAS HER PERSONALITY 
ROCK WHERE'S THE MAKE UP ARTIST ROCK WHERE'S THIS WHERE'S THAT 
BUT YOU LIKE THAT IN A TALENT YOU LIKE A TALENT THAT REALLY REALLY WANTS TO GET THINGS DONE 
I TELL HER ALL THE TIME SHE ALREADY HAS THE ATTITUDE OF A STAR BECAUSE THAT'S HOW STARS ARE 
THEY WANT THIS DONE AND THEY WANT THAT DONE THEY WANT MOVEMENT THEY WANT THINGS TO HAPPEN 
AND AND WE SEE THAT IN HER BUT SHE DOES IT IN SUCH A. 
ALMOST CHARMINGLY FUNNY WAY 
IN DEVON NINETEEN YEAR OLD JENNA SANSOM IS VISITING HER HOMETOWN OF TOTNES 
SHE LEFT HOME THREE MONTHS AGO TO LIVE IN LONDON 
THIS IS OUR LOCAL WHERE WE GO IF WE GO OUT ON A FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT 
THIS IS JUST A NORMAL PUB AND WHEN I GO INTO LONDON IT'S LIKE YEAH YOU'RE ON THE GUEST LIST 
OR WHATEVER AND IT'S LIKE ALL THE TOP CLUBS IN LONDON SO YEAH IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT 
THE AGENCY TOOK JENNA ON ONLY AFTER DECIDING THE YOUNG MODEL HAD LOST ENOUGH WEIGHT TO BE A SAM BOND GIRL

OH THAT'S BRILL 
YEAH WELL DONE YOU'VE WORKED HARD

I JUST LOOK AT HER AS MY BEST MATE REALLY 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT BOTHERS ME BUT IT'S FUNNY WHEN OTHER PEOPLE TURN ROUND AND GO OH 
AND LOOK AT HER THAT'S QUITE AMUSING SO YEAH 
ONE TIME WHEN I WAS AT THE GYM THIS IS REALLY EMBARRASSING I THOUGHT 
RIGHT I'M NOT GOING TOTNES GYM COS I KNOW PEOPLE

AND THIS GUY COME UP TO ME WITH THE PAPER WHILST I'M ON THE ROWING MACHINE AND I WAS LIKE UH 
AND HE GOES LIKE IS THIS YOU I'M LIKE OH MY GOD HOW EMBARRASSING 
ALL SWEATY LOOKED LIKE AN ABSOLUTE SCRUBBER 
AND THEN I WAS LIKE YEAH 
I WAS LIKE YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME NOW CAN YOU GO AWAY

THIS NEW FOUND FAME MIGHT NOT BE QUITE WHAT JENNA HAD IN MIND WHEN SHE STARTED MODELLING 
AT THE FAMILY HOME JENNA'S FRIENDS HAVE COME ROUND TO SPEND THE EVENING 
MUM BRENDA IS ONLY JUST GETTING USED TO JENNA'S NEW LIFE AWAY FROM HOME 
WHEN SHE'S IN LONDON SHE LOOKS TOTALLY DIFFERENT IN A LOT OF WAYS 
COS WHEN I WENT UP TO STAY SHE MET ME OFF THE TRAIN AND SHE 
SHE WAS STANDING THERE AND IT WAS LIKE 
I LOOKED AT HER AND THOUGHT IS THAT JENNA 
I MEAN SHE ALWAYS LOOKS BEAUTIFUL ANYWAY COS SHE'S JUST NATURALLY 
PRETTY BUT SHE JUST LOOKED LIKE SOME SORT OF FILM STAR STOOD THERE 
SOMETIMES I DO HAVE PEOPLE SAY TO ME YOU KNOW 
HOW DO YOU FEEL COS JENNA'S SHOWING HERSELF OFF TO THE WORLD 
AS I SAY BECAUSE IT'S WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO 
AND SHE'S HAPPY I'VE GOT NO QUALMS WITH IT 
DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE AS FAZED BY IT AS IF IT WAS FORTY YEARS AGO AND MY MUM DOING IT 
PEOPLE WOULD LOOK DIFFERENTLY IF BACK 
IN HER TIME SHE WAS DOING IT 
NOW THINGS ARE MORE RELAXED AND PEOPLE AREN'T AS BOTHERED AND DON'T TALK AS MUCH 
YOU STILL GET THE FEW PEOPLE THAT DISAGREE WITH THEIR PARENTS LETTING THEM DO IT 
AT THE END OF THE DAY MY MUM AND DAD WILL SUPPORT THEM WITH WHATEVER I WANT TO DO 
COME ON MOTHER GET YOUR TITS OUT

SAM GETS SOME DISAPPOINTING NEWS FROM NUTS MAGAZINE WHO ARE ONE OF THEIR MAJOR CLIENTS 
HE WAS MAKING COMMENTS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY ARE MORE INCLINED TO DO 
THINGS ON CELEBRITIES RATHER THAN GLAMOUR GIRLS 
I SAID I USED THE WORD GLAMOUR BUT I'M SURE YOU HAVE CELEBRITIES DRESSED UP GLAMOROUSLY 
HE SAID NO IF YOU LOOK AT OUR LATEST COVER THEY'RE NOT IN LINGERIE OR BIKINIS 
WE HAVE BASICALLY COVERED ALL THE BASES THERE WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT FOR A REPLY 
IN MIAMI AMANDA'S MAKE UP IS NEARLY DONE FOR HER MAXIM CALENDAR SHOOT 
AND ROCK HAS JUST RETURNED WITH THE CRUCIAL HAIR STYLING EQUIPMENT 
DID YOU HAVE ANY LUCK 
I HOPE SO I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HAIR 
YOU DID GOOD 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SIZE YOU WANTED 
PERFECT YOU ARE SMART BRINGING THAT BAG OF CONES 
THIS CURLING IRON IS NOT DOING ANYTHING 
IT IS CALMING DOWN YOUR FLYAWAYS 
WHAT'S THAT 
THE FRIZZINESS IT'S CALMING ALL THAT DOWN 
IT MIGHT JUST LOOK LIKE YOU GOT UP AND PUT ON YOUR LINGERIE AND MAKE UP AND THAT WAS IT 
IS IT REALLY NOT DOING A THING 
I'M GOING TO SPRAY IT DOWN 
THAT'S WHAT HE GETS FOR GOING TO WAL MART 
I TOLD HIM NOT TO GO TO WAL MART 
YOU CAN STILL GO TO WAL MART AND BUY CURLING IRONS MORE THAN THREE DOLLARS 
HE GOT THREE FOR THREE DOLLARS

ROCK 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'VE DONE 
YOU'VE BOUGHT US THREE THREE DOLLARS CURLING IRONS AND THEY DON'T WORK 
THE CURLING IRONS DON'T GET HOT 
THEY GET LUKEWARM 
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT CURLING IRONS 
IT SAID CURLING IRONS SO I FIGURED THEY GOT HOT 
WE NEED TO SORT THIS HAIR OUT 
I'M SCARED ME TOO 
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CURLING IRONS SO I RAN OUT TO THE STORE TO 
GET SOME CURLING IRONS AND MAKE THE SHOOT AND THEY WERE REALLY HORRIBLE 
THE MAKE UP ARTIST WAS SO GOOD 
THAT SHE MADE THEM WORK IN SPITE OF HOW HORRIBLE THEY WERE 
I'M GOING TO KEEP THE RECEIPT I'M TAKING THEM BACK 
IT ALL WORKED OUT SHE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL WE'LL GET THE WORK DONE

THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY JENNA GETS PAID PER SHOOT IS JUST POCKET MONEY COMPARED

THE PRICE SHE PAYS FOR THE PRIVILEGE IS CONSTANT 
SCRUTINY OF HER BODY BEFORE HER PICTURE EVEN HITS THE NEWS STAND 
SHE HAS A NICE BODY WHEN SHE STARTED

ONE SAM BOND GIRL WHO'S BECOMING JADED 
BY THE LONDON GLAMOUR SCENE IS TWENTY YEAR OLD GEMMA HILES 
GEMMA'S BEEN A GLAMOUR GIRL FOR TWO AND HALF YEARS 
WORKING FOR SEVERAL MAGAZINES INCLUDING FAST CAR 
THESE DAYS SHE'S SPENDING MORE AND MORE TIME 
AT HER PARENTS' HOME IN LANCASHIRE 
THE NOVELTY OF IT SOON WEARS OFF 
YOU LOVE IT AT FIRST AND YOU'RE OUT THERE PARTYING 
WHICH IS A GOOD THING COS YOU GET YOUR NAME AROUND 
BUT THEN YOU GET BORED OF IT 
YOU JUST WANT TO GET BACK TO YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS THAT YOU CAN HAVE A PROPER NIGHT OUT WITH 
THE BIGGEST PERK OF BEING AT HOME MORE 
IS CUT PRICE MAINTENANCE FROM BEAUTY THERAPIST MUM YVONNE 
IN CASTINGS IF YOU TAKE YOUR PORTFOLIO 
AND THEY LOOK AT YOUR PICTURES BUT IF YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT IN REAL LIFE 
THEY'RE GOING TO NOTICE THAT IT WOULD BE A LOT OF WORK INVOLVED TO MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE THAT 
IF YOU GO LOOKING LIKE YOUR PICTURES HOW YOU ADVERTISE YOURSELF 
YOU'RE GOING TO GET A BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING THE JOB 
WITH MOST GLAMOUR WORK HAPPENING IN LONDON 
GEMMA'S NOW CONSIDERING A FUTURE BEYOND MODELLING 
I'VE JUST STARTED COLLEGE DOING A CASINO COURSE 
WHERE WE'VE GOT TO USE THE POKER CHIPS AND CUT THE CHIPS AND STUFF 
IT IS A BIT DIFFICULT TO HAVE NAILS ON FOR THAT 
SO I'VE HAD TO TAKE THEM OFF WHICH WAS A BIT OF A NIGHTMARE 
THEY'RE DONE LET THEM DRY FOR A BIT SIT STILL LIKE YOU NORMALLY CAN'T 
HI GUYS 
NEAR OXFORD CIRCUS 
LOUISE GLOVER ARRIVES AT CELEBRITY NIGHTCLUB MOVEDA 
BUT SHE'S NOT HERE TO PARTY 
SHE'S USED HER OWN CONTACTS TO APPEAR IN A FASHION SHOW 
FOR DESIGNER CLOTHING BRAND ED HARDY 
IT IS NOT PAID WORK BUT IT'S A CHANCE TO SHOW OFF 
HER MODELLING SKILLS TO A POTENTIAL NEW CLIENT 
THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE AND SHOW PEOPLE THIS IS WHAT I LOOK LIKE 
THIS IS THE REAL ME SHOW MY PERSONALITY 
GIVE THEM A TWIRL 
DO WHAT YOU WANT EVERYONE'S GOING TO BE INDIVIDUAL O. K. 
IT'S A FASHION SHOW IT'S JUST NOT GLAMOUR 
AND I'M HAPPY ABOUT IT BECAUSE I'M MODELLING CLOTHES 
AND I FEEL SEXIER WITH CLOTHES ON 
CAMERAS WILL BE THERE O. K. 
I WANT YOU TO USE THIS AS YOUR BACKDROP 
IT IS GOOD FOR ME TO BE BREAKING AWAY FROM THE GLAMOUR 
I'VE DONE TOO MUCH OF IT 
YOU GO IN AT EIGHTEEN I'M TWENTY FOUR NOW I NEED TO BREAK INTO NEWER THINGS 
LOUISE HAS ALSO ROPED IN HER HUSBAND BEN 
THEY'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR A YEAR AND THE TWENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD SCAFFOLDER 
IS USUALLY MORE AT HOME ON A BUILDING SITE THAN A CATWALK 
SHE USED TO GO TO CELEBRITY PARTIES BEFORE SHE MET ME 
I AM A SCAFFOLDER JUST A NICE PERSON 
I TREAT HER WITH RESPECT I NEVER CHEAT ON HER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
SHE LOOKED AT ME AND LOOKED PAST THE FOOTBALLER 
THE STEREOTYPE A LOT OF MODELS 
THEY WANT TO GO FOR WHO THEY ARE AND NOT WHAT THEY ARE 
SHE SEES ME FOR WHAT I AM 
AND THAT'S WHAT MADE ME FALL IN LOVE WITH HER 
BOTH BEN AND LOUISE ARE A BIG HIT WITH THE CLUBBERS 
NEXT TIME ON GLAMOUR GIRLS AMANDA DISCOVERS THE TRUE COST OF WORKING ABROAD 
ARE YOU MISSING ME YES I MISS YOU TOO 
KATIE ADDS A TOUCH OF GLAMOUR TO THE HIGH STREET 
THERE WE GO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
