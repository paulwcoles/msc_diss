TAKE A WALK ON ANY CITY STREET TOWN SQUARE OR VILLAGE GREEN 
AND IT'S A FAIR BET YOU'LL SEE ODDS AND ENDS LEFT OVER FROM THE PAST 
THIS IS THE EMBANKMENT BESIDE THE RIVER THAMES IN LONDON 
ON THAT SIDE CARS RUSH BY BUT ON THIS SIDE AN OBELISK OF GRANITE 
OVER TWENTY METRES TALL AND ONE HUNDRED SEVEN TONNES IN WEIGHT 
WHICH WAS CARVED OUT OF SOLID ROCK TWO THOUSAND MILES AWAY THREE THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
CLEOPATRA'S NEEDLE CONNECTS ME AND THIS DAY BY THE THAMES 
BACK THROUGH TIME TO ANOTHER RIVER AND A PAST DEEP IN ANCIENT HISTORY 
THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IT WAS CARVED FOR THE PHARAOH TUTHMOSIS THE THIRD 
AND PLACED IN FRONT OF THE TEMPLE OF THE SUN AT HELIOPOLIS 
TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO DURING THE REIGN OF THE ROMAN EMPEROR AUGUSTUS CAESAR 
IT WAS TAKEN TO ALEXANDRIA TO THE TEMPLE DEDICATED TO JULIUS CAESAR 
SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS AGO IT WAS TOPPLED BY AN EARTHQUAKE 
AND LAY ON ITS SIDE UNTIL ONE HUNDRED TWENTY YEARS AGO DURING THE REIGN OF VICTORIA 
IT WAS TOWED BY STEAMSHIP AND RAISED AT ITS NEW SITE BESIDE THE THAMES 
THE PAST IN MANY WAYS HASN'T GONE 
IF YOU LOOK YOU CAN TRACE A LINE BACK THROUGH TIME 
AND ALMOST TOUCH A CIVILISATION THAT'S LONG VANISHED 
IN THIS PROGRAMME WE'RE GOING TO TRACE A LINE THROUGH TIME 
TO SEE HOW DIFFERENT PEOPLES USED IMAGES AND SYMBOLS 
TO REPRESENT THE EVENTS AND IDEAS OF THE AGE IN WHICH THEY LIVED 
HOLD ONTO YOUR SEATS WE'RE GOING BACK 
ANCIENT EGYPT IS THE EARLIEST CIVILISATION 
WHICH LEFT BEHIND A VAST COLLECTION OF IMAGES AND WRITING 
THE FITZWILLIAM MUSEUM IN CAMBRIDGE HAS A COLLECTION FROM ANCIENT EGYPT 
THEY'VE GOT A MIRROR A BASKET POTS SPOONS KNIVES 
LIKE THE THINGS I'VE GOT IN THE BACK OF MY GARAGE ONLY OLDER 
AND EGYPTIAN 
ONE THING ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS IS HOW MUCH WRITING THERE IS ON THEM 
TAKE THIS THERE'S WRITING ALL DOWN THE FRONT BUT WHAT DOES IT SAY 
RE HARAKHTY AND OSIRIS SOKAR LORD OF THE UNDERWORLD 
MAY THEY GIVE BREAD OXEN CLOTH ALABASTER 
TO NAKHT EF MUT TRUE OF VOICE 
HE IS THE SON OF NESY PER NUB TRUE OF VOICE 
SOME OF THE THINGS HERE ARE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
SOME ARE THREE THOUSAND OR EVEN FOUR THOUSAND YEARS OLD 
SO HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE THAT OLD 
HOW DO THEY KNOW THEY HAVEN'T GOT IT WRONG 
I ONLY ASKED HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU HAVEN'T GOT IT WRONG HELLO HELLO 
I'M LUCIA GAHLIN AN ARCHAEOLOGIST SPECIALISING IN EGYPT 
VERY HANDY HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW OLD THE THINGS IN THE MUSEUM ARE 
HAVE A GO AT DATING SOME OBJECTS YOURSELF 
ARE YOU GAME FOR THAT I'D LOVE TO 
LUCIA I HARDLY THINK A SELECTION OF TOYS 
WILL HELP US DATE ANCIENT EGYPT THINGS HAVE A GO AND I'LL EXPLAIN 
NOW THEN MONEY LIKE IT 
HERE'S A TILL WITH POUNDS SHILLINGS AND PENCE ON IT 
POUNDS SHILLINGS AND PENCE WENT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE SO THIS IS 
GREAT A SIMILAR IDEA FOR ANCIENT EGYPT 
IF AN ARCHAEOLOGIST FINDS A KNIFE THAT'S BRONZE 
IT HAS TO DATE TO LATER THAN TWO THOUSAND B. C. 
BECAUSE THE EGYPTIANS WEREN'T USING BRONZE BEFORE TWO THOUSAND B. C. 
HAVE ANOTHER GO ALL RIGHT 
HERE'S A CAR I LIKE CARS 
IT'S BLACK IN COLOUR 
IT HAS RUNNING BOARDS AND THE LIGHTS STICK OUT A BIT 
PROBABLY NINETEEN THIRTY TO NINETEEN FORTY 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE STYLE I AM 
FOR ANCIENT EGYPTIAN ARTEFACTS THE STYLE CHANGES THROUGHOUT HISTORY 
POTTERY IS A BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE 
POTTERY CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE THREE THOUSAND YEARS OF EGYPTIAN HISTORY 
IF WE FIND A POT IN THE GROUND ALONGSIDE SAY A COMB 
WE CAN ASSUME THAT THE COMB MUST DATE TO THE SAME SORT OF TIME 
AS THE POT BY LOOKING AT THE STYLE 
O. K. BUT WHAT'S THAT WRITING ALL ABOUT 
LET'S FIND OUT I'LL SHOW YOU SOME EXAMPLES O. K. 
THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS USED TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF WRITING 
THEY USED HIEROGLYPHS 
AND WE'VE GOT AN EXAMPLE HERE WRITTEN ON A SHABTI FIGURE 
THE HIEROGLYPHS SAY 
SO HIEROGLYPHS WERE WRITTEN ON THE WALLS OF TOMBS ON TEMPLE WALLS 
AND ON OBJECTS YOU'D FIND IN TOMBS AND TEMPLES 
NOW HIERATIC WAS MUCH QUICKER AND SIMPLER TO WRITE THAN HIEROGLYPHS 
IN DOCUMENTS FROM EVERYDAY LIFE HIERATIC WAS USED 
SO YOU FIND A BIT OF LIMESTONE WITH A TEXT THAT RECORDS 
IS THIS A LIST OF THE NUMBER OF CHAIRS PRODUCED BY THE CARPENTER 
WE DON'T KNOW BUT IT'S A RECORD OF EVERYDAY LIFE 
IT'S HARD TO GRASP THE LENGTH OF TIME ANCIENT EGYPTIANS WERE AROUND 
PUT IT THIS WAY IF WE THINK OF THE LAST FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AS A TWENTY FOUR HOUR PARTY 
WITH GUESTS COMING AND GOING 
THE EGYPTIANS TURNED UP AT MIDNIGHT AND STAYED TILL EARLY AFTERNOON 
BY COMPARISON THE VICTORIANS ARRIVED AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT 
AND BY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THERE WERE GONE THEY WERE ONLY THERE FOR HALF AN HOUR 
YOU CAN COUNT THE YEARS OF ANCIENT EGYPT IN MILLENNIA 
THE CIVILISATION OF ANCIENT EGYPT SPANNED THREE MILLENNIA 
AS IT DECLINED IT WAS BROUGHT UNDER A NEW POWER 
GREECE 
THE ANCIENT GREEKS PRODUCED STATUES POTS AND COINS 
ON WHICH THEY REPRESENTED THEIR WORLD 
AND THEY DEVELOPED A NEW WRITING SYSTEM THE ALPHABET 
THE ANCIENT GREEK CIVILISATION PRODUCED WRITERS LOTS OF THEM 
YOU NAME IT THEY WROTE IT 
POEMS PLAYS PHILOSOPHY POLITICS MATHEMATICS MEDICINE 
THEIR BOOKS ARE STILL IN PRINT SOME TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THEY WERE WRITTEN 
THIS ONE WAS A BESTSELLER RICH IN CHARACTER ADVENTURE AND INCIDENT 
IT RECOUNTS ODYSSEUS' RETURN FROM THE TROJAN WAR 
WITHIN THE WALLS OF TROY WAITED ODYSSEUS AND HIS COMPANIONS 
HIDDEN WITHIN THE WOODEN HORSE 
THE TROJANS HAD PULLED THE HORSE INTO THEIR FORTRESS 
SOME WERE FOR BREAKING IT UP SOME FOR HURLING IT ONTO THE ROCKS 
SOME WISHED IT TO REMAIN AS AN OFFERING TO THE GODS 
IN THE END THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED 
TROY WAS DOOMED WHEN IT TOOK IN THAT HORSE 
WITHIN WHICH WERE THE GREEKS 
THEY POURED OUT OF THE HORSE TO BRING DESTRUCTION UPON THE TROJANS 
SO SLAP BANG IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS WAR 
THE GREEKS WANDER UP WITH THIS WOODEN HORSE 
AND THE TROJANS THINK THAT'S NICE A WOODEN HORSE LET'S BRING IT IN 
SOMEHOW I DON'T THINK SO I WONDER WHAT REALLY HAPPENED 
I WISH I KNEW AN EXPERT IN GREEK LITERATURE 
I CAN HELP I'M JON HESK I'M A LECTURER IN GREEK LITERATURE 
WHAT A STROKE OF LUCK 
WHERE DOES THE STORY OF THE WOODEN HORSE ACTUALLY COME FROM 
WELL IT COMES FROM A LONG POEM 
THERE ARE TWO VERY FAMOUS POEMS FROM ANCIENT GREECE 
THEY'RE CALLED THE ILIAD AND THE ODYSSEY 
THEY'RE BASED ON STORIES THAT STARTED BEING TOLD AROUND ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED B. C. 
A TIME WHEN A LOT OF PIRACY WAS GOING ON IN THE MEDITERRANEAN 
THE ILIAD TELLS THE STORY OF THE WAR BETWEEN THE ACHAEANS THE GREEKS 
AND THE TROJANS 
WE THINK THE TROJANS CAME FROM WHAT IS NOW TURKEY 
THE SECOND POEM THE ODYSSEY 
TELLS THE STORY OF THE VOYAGE HOME FROM THAT WAR 
IT PARTICULARLY FOCUSES ON THE STORY OF ODYSSEUS 
IT'S IN THE ODYSSEY THAT WE GET THE STORY OF THE WOODEN HORSE 
WAS THE STORY OF THE HORSE TRUTHFUL OR MADE UP 
IT'S UNLIKELY THAT IT WAS TRUTHFUL THOUGH IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT WAS 
IT WAS PERHAPS BASED ON TRUTH 
THE WOODEN HORSE MAY HAVE BEEN A BATTERING RAM OR A SIEGE WEAPON 
PERHAPS WITH A HORSE'S HEAD ON THE END OF IT 
REMEMBER THAT THESE STORIES WERE BEING TOLD FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS 
BEFORE THEY WERE WRITTEN DOWN 
EACH GENERATION PASSED THESE STORIES DOWN 
AND THEY CHANGED THEM THEY WOULD FORGET THINGS ADD THINGS 
IT'S LIKE A CHINESE WHISPERS EFFECT 
THE WAY THAT THE STORIES WERE TOLD THEY GET DISTORTED AND CHANGED 
YOU CAN COUNT THE YEARS OF THE GREEK CIVILISATION IN CENTURIES 
CLASSICAL ANCIENT GREECE DEVELOPED AND DECLINED IN ONLY SIX CENTURIES 
IN ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX B. C. GREECE WAS ABSORBED INTO THE ROMAN EMPIRE 
ROMAN POWER HAD BEEN GROWING SINCE AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY B. C. 
AS THE EMPIRE EXPANDED IT TOOK OVER JUDEA 
WHERE THE MAN CALLED JESUS CHRIST WAS BORN 
THE YEAR OF HIS BIRTH IS A MARKER YEAR FROM WHICH OTHERS ARE COUNTED 
YEARS BEFORE IT HAVE THE LETTERS B. C. AFTER THEM MEANING BEFORE CHRIST 
YEARS AFTER THE BIRTH OF JESUS HAVE THE LETTERS AD IN FRONT OF THEM 
AD STANDS FOR ANNO DOMINI THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 
THIS SYSTEM WAS STARTED BY FOLLOWERS OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION 
IN AD FORTY THREE THE ROMANS INVADED THE LAND OF THE BRITONS 
FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS BRITAIN WAS PART OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 
UNTIL AROUND AD FOUR HUNDRED ROMAN RULE IN BRITAIN CAME TO AN END 
LEAVING THE LAND OPEN TO INVASION 
THE ANGLO SAXONS WERE THE DOMINANT FORCE IN BRITAIN 
IN THIS YEAR MARTIANUS AND VALENTINIAN BECAME RULERS OF THE EMPIRE 
AND THEY REIGNED FOR SEVEN YEARS 
DURING THEIR TIME KING VORTIGERN INVITED THE ANGLES TO THESE SHORES 
THEY LANDED IN BRITAIN AT A PLACE CALLED EBBSFLEET 
HE GAVE THEM LAND 
ON CONDITION THAT THEY FIGHT FOR HIM AGAINST THE PICTS 
THIS THEY DID AND EVERYWHERE THEY WERE VICTORIOUS 
THEY SENT BACK WORD TO THEIR PEOPLE SAYING HOW COWARDLY THE BRITONS WERE 
AND HOW RICH THEIR LAND WAS AND ASKING MORE OF THEM TO COME 
MEN CAME FROM THE THREE TRIBES OF GERMANY 
FROM THE OLD SAXONS THE ANGLES AND THE JUTES 
THE ANGLO SAXON CHRONICLE DESCRIBES THE ARRIVAL OF THE JUTES THE ANGLES AND THE SAXONS IN BRITAIN 
THIS IS A COPY OF IT THERE ARE ONLY SEVEN STILL SURVIVING 
THIS ONE IS IN THE BRITISH LIBRARY 
IT'S OVER NINE HUNDRED YEARS OLD AND ENTIRELY WRITTEN BY HAND 
I'M OFF TO MEET SOMEONE WHO KNOWS MORE 
IN THE RUINED ABBEY AT LEISTON SUFFOLK 
I'M MEETING RIKKE OSTERLUND AN ARCHAEOLOGY STUDENT 
HI MATT HI RIKKE HOW ARE YOU FINE THANK YOU 
I'M TOLD YOU'RE AN EXPERT ON THE ANGLO SAXON CHRONICLE 
PERHAPS NOT QUITE AN EXPERT BUT I STUDY MEDIEVAL ARCHAEOLOGY SO I KNOW A BIT ABOUT THE CHRONICLE 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW 
WHAT IS THE ANGLO SAXON CHRONICLE 
IT'S A BIT LIKE A DIARY 
BUT THEY WRITE DOWN WHAT HAPPENED EACH YEAR 
SO ON EACH PAGE THERE'S THE YEAR IN ROMAN NUMERALS 
IT COULD BE AD SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY SIX OR AD EIGHT HUNDRED FOUR 
AND AN ACCOUNT OF THE EVENTS THAT HAPPENED THAT YEAR 
WHO WROTE IT DOWN MONKS WHO LIVED IN ABBEYS LIKE THIS 
THEY WERE SOME OF THE FEW PEOPLE THEN WHO COULD WRITE 
WHAT DID THEY WRITE THINGS THAT SEEMED IMPORTANT 
INVASION BATTLES BAD HARVESTS OR ILLNESS AFFECTING PEOPLE OR ANIMALS 
THINGS THEY SAW IN THE SKY AS WELL 
IN AD SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY THREE TO FOUR THERE WAS AN ECLIPSE 
AND THEY WROTE THE SUN GREW DARK AND THE MOON WAS SUFFUSED WITH BLOOD 
IN AD ONE THOUSAND FIVE THERE WAS A FAMINE IN ENGLAND AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DIED 
ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING RECORDED IS IN AD SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY THREE 
WHEN THE VIKINGS ARRIVED IN ENGLAND 
DID EVERYTHING IN THE CHRONICLE ACTUALLY HAPPEN SOMETIMES IT DID 
IT'S A BIT OF A ONE SIDED VIEW 
THE ANGLO SAXONS ARE OFTEN PORTRAYED AS VERY HEROIC PROUD 
BUT THE WRITINGS WERE COLLECTED AT THE TIME OF KING ALFRED THE GREAT 
MANY PEOPLE THINK HE WANTED THE CHRONICLE WRITTEN DOWN 
THE VIKINGS WERE INVADING SO PERHAPS HE HOPED TO MAKE THE ANGLO SAXONS FEEL THEY HAD A GREAT PAST 
AND THEY WOULD FIGHT OFF THE VIKINGS 
SO IT'S A MORALE BOOSTER FOR THE ANGLO SAXONS TO MAKE THEM THINK HOW GREAT THEY ARE 
ALL DOCUMENTS IN BRITAIN WERE COPIED BY HAND 
UNTIL IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX WILLIAM CAXTON SET UP A PRINTING PRESS IN LONDON 
BOOKS PAMPHLETS NEWS SHEETS COULD BE PRODUCED CHEAPLY 
AND IN LARGE NUMBERS 
IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THE FIRST ENGLISH NEWSPAPERS APPEARED 
BY THE MID NINETEENTH CENTURY OVER ONE THOUSAND NEWSPAPERS REPORTED ON BRITAIN 
AND ENTIRELY NEW TECHNIQUES FOR RECORDING THE WORLD WERE DEVELOPING 
IN BRITAIN IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY NINE WILLIAM FOX TALBOT PERFECTED THE PROCESS OF PHOTOGRAPHY 
IN AMERICA IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN THOMAS EDISON INVENTED THE PHONOGRAPH AND RECORDED THE HUMAN VOICE 
IN FRANCE IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT LOUIS LE PRINCE INVENTED MOVING PICTURES 
WHAT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY BEGAN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WOULD BUILD ON 
THE TWENTIETH CENTURY TOOK THE INVENTIONS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY DEVELOPED THEM AND ADDED NEW ONES 
THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN MORE DETAIL THAN ANY AGE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD 
I WONDER HOW MANY OF THE RECORDED SOUNDS AND IMAGES OF THIS CENTURY 
WILL STILL SURVIVE IN FIVE THOUSAND YEARS 
PEOPLE IN AD SEVEN THOUSAND WILL LOOK AT US AS WE LOOK AT THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS 
BUT WILL THEY GET AN ACCURATE VIEW FROM THE EVIDENCE WE LEAVE BEHIND
