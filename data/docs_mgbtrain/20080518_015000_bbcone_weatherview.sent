THE INDIANA JONES TRILOGY CONCLUDES 
HELLO CLOUDY SKIES ACROSS MOST OF THE U. K. ON SATURDAY 
BUT I THINK SUNDAY SHOULD BRING US MUCH BRIGHTER SKIES 
WITH SOME DECENT SPELLS OF SUNSHINE PARTICULARLY IN THE MORNING 
WHY THE CHANGE WE'VE GOT A COLD FRONT EDGING DOWN FROM THE NORTH 
CLEARER WEATHER BEHIND THAT COOLER AIR AS WELL 
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN TO SQUEEZE OUT THE RAIN 
IN MAY PARTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES 
THE LAST OF THAT RAIN CLEARING AWAY FROM THE SOUTH WEST TONIGHT 
SKIES CLEARING ACROSS EASTERN SCOTLAND INTO THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
TEMPERATURES TAKING QUITE A DIVE 
FROST POSSIBLE IN THE SCOTTISH GLENS BY THE END OF THE NIGHT 
THERE'LL STILL BE SOME CLOUD AROUND SO NOT SUNNY SKIES TO START WITH 
AND NOT ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND BUT MORE SUNSHINE IN SCOTLAND 
A CHILL IN THE AIR AND A COOL BREEZE STILL FILTERING IN FROM THE NORTH 
ACROSS NORTHERN ENGLAND MOST PLACES WILL SEE SOME SUNSHINE 
BUT AGAIN A BIT OF A CHILL IN THE AIR 
FURTHER SOUTH DESPITE THE SUNSHINE THAT EAST TO NORTH EASTERLY BREEZE 
WILL HAVE AN EDGE SO A RATHER CHILLY SPRING MORNING 
IF YOU HEAD OUTSIDE EARLY ON 
IN THE SOUTH WEST A LITTLE BIT OF CLOUD LINGERING FROM OVERNIGHT 
ACROSS DEVON AND CORNWALL AND WILL TAKE A LITTLE WHILE TO CLEAR AWAY 
SUNNY SKIES SHOULD EDGE IN AS THE MORNING WEARS ON 
SUNSHINE IN NORTHERN IRELAND TOO BUT ACROSS CENTRAL PARTS OF THE U. K. 
A SPECKLE OF CLOUD DEVELOPING INTO THE AFTERNOON 
THE CLOUD WILL BUBBLE UP AND SPREAD OUT SO HIDING THE SUNSHINE 
ON THE EAST COAST TEMPERATURES NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO PRODUCE THE CLOUDS 
SO SUNNY HERE BUT BALANCED BY A COOL BREEZE OFF THE NORTH SEA 
SOME WESTERN PARTS OF THE HIGHLANDS COULD SEE SIXTEEN DEGREES 
BUT FOURTEEN A BETTER AVERAGE HERE 
FIFTEEN IN THE SUNSHINE IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND REASONABLE SUNSHINE 
IN THE AFTERNOON IN WALES 
THE ODD LIGHT SHOWER NOT COMPLETELY TO BE RULED OUT 
A MUCH BETTER DAY THAN TODAY IN THE SOUTH WEST 
WITH TEMPERATURES AROUND FIFTEEN DEGREES BY THE AFTERNOON 
WHEN THE SUN GOES IN YOU'LL NOTICE HIGHS OF SIXTEEN DEGREES IN LONDON 
AS WE GO THROUGH THE NIGHT WE FIND THE SKIES 
CLEARING THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT ACROSS THE WHOLE OF THE U. K. 
LIGHT WINDS CLEAR SKIES QUITE A DROP IN TEMPERATURE GROUND FROST 
POSSIBLE EVERYWHERE PARTICULARLY FROM THE MIDLANDS NORTHWARDS 
GARDENERS TAKE NOTE LOTS OF SUNSHINE AROUND ON MONDAY 
AGAIN PATCHY CLOUD DEVELOPING AS THE DAY GOES ON 
TEMPERATURES A BIT BELOW PAR TWELVE TO FIFTEEN DEGREES 
SIMILAR IN THE NORTH RIGHT THROUGH TO THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK 
IT'S A DRY STORY BIT OF SUNSHINE COMING THROUGH AS WELL 
TEMPERATURES AROUND SEVENTEEN DEGREES BY MIDWEEK IN LONDON 
THE GARDENS IN CHELSEA SHOULD BE LOOKING THEIR BEST BYE BYE
