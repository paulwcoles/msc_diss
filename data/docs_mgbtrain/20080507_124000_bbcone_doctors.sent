I'M SORRY THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A WRENCH WELL IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS 
WHAT A NIGHTMARE 
IT'LL BLOW OVER BLOW OVER 
IT'S NOT EXACTLY THE WAY TO LAUNCH A SURGERY IS IT 
DOCTOR FOUND DEAD IN BUILDING 
I MEAN HOW DOES IT LOOK IT'S A PERSONAL TRAGEDY FOR DOCTOR DOWNHAM AND HIS FAMILY 
IT'S CLEARLY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PRACTICE IT'S THE SORT OF THING PEOPLE REMEMBER FOR YEARS 
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT THE WORSE IT GETS THEY'LL FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO TALK ABOUT 
AND ONCE THE POLICE GIVE US ACCESS WE'LL BE IN BUSINESS 
AND THAT HAS TO BE TODAY DOESN'T IT YOU'D THINK SO WOULDN'T YOU I'M GOING TO GIVE THEM A CALL 
SEE IF I CAN PUT A ROCKET UP THEM 
JULIA IT'S THE EVENING POST ON THE PHONE THEY WANT YOU TO GIVE A STATEMENT 
APPARENTLY IT'S GOING TO BE ALL OVER THE FRONT PAGE 
IT'LL TAKE A WHILE TO FEEL THE FULL EFFECT HAVE A GOOD HOOVER MAKE SURE YOU GET RID OF ANY HAIRS 
SORRY BUT IT REALLY HAS TO BE AS IF THOMAS WAS NEVER HERE 
YES WELL IF THAT'S ALL THEN 
I'M SORRY I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE 
BUT I'VE GOT THINGS TO DO 
COURSE GET THIS RADIO GOING FOR A START 
GIVE ME A BIT OF COMPANY 
NO WORRIES 
DO YOU WANT YOUR INHALER NO IT'S ON THE KITCHEN TABLE I'LL GET IT 
NO IT'S ALL RIGHT I'LL GET IT 
ANYTHING TO SAY 
I COULDN'T DO IT COULD I 
FELT LIKE I WAS SENDING HIM AWAY TO PRISON 
BUT HE'LL LOVE IT AND HE'LL PROBABLY GET PLACED WITH A NEW FAMILY WON'T HE 
THAT'S A LOAD OF RUBBISH 
HE'S AN OLD FELLA NOW IT'S TOO LATE FOR HIM STARTING OVER WITH SOMEONE NEW 
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO START AGAIN 
WHAT IF I GET ON THE PHONE TO THE REFUGE 
YOU COULD TELL THEM ABOUT YOUR WORRIES THESE PEOPLE LOVE CATS IT'S WHAT THEY DO 
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THAT THOUGH IS IT I MEAN IF HE GOES WHO AM I GOING TO TALK TO 
SOUNDS A BIT PATHETIC THAT DOESN'T IT 
THERE MUST BE PEOPLE AROUND WHY NOT GO DOWN THE LEGION OR SOMETHING 
OR WHATEVER YOU OLD PEOPLE DO 
WHAT ABOUT THE NEIGHBOUR YOU GET ON WELL WITH HER DON'T YOU 
I REMEMBER YOU TELLING ME ABOUT HER 
SHE USED TO WORK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR SOMETHING CIVIL SERVANT THAT'S THE ONE 
YEAH WELL SHE'S NOT BEEN SO CIVIL RECENTLY REALLY 
WE'VE HAD WORDS 
ABOUT WHAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT ABOUT NEXT TO NOTHING 
SHE'S MADE BEN NEVIS OUT OF A MOLEHILL AND THAT'S THAT 
SUFFICE TO SAY SHE'LL NOT BE COMING ROUND HERE AGAIN 
REALLY 
ANYWAY I'D I'D BEST GO 
BYE 
THAT SHOULD KEEP THE UNIVERSITY QUIET FOR A BIT 
I'VE JUST HAD TO CALM DOWN A VERY EXCITABLE COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER HAVING A PANIC 
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO TELL TO THE PRESS I MEAN ARE THEIR LIVES THAT DULL 
WHAT 
THAT WAS SOMEONE I KNOW WORKS AT THE UNI 
APPARENTLY THERE'S A RUMOUR GOING ROUND IT WAS MURDER 
SSSH REVENGE BY A PATIENT ON A DOCTOR MAKING A TERRIBLE MISTAKE 
WHY WOULD THEY THINK THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE STUDENTS 
BECAUSE THE POLICE ARE STILL THERE NOT SAYING ANYTHING MUST LOOK SUSPICIOUS 
APPARENTLY THERE'S LOADS OF REPORTERS UP THERE AND I THOUGHT IT COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE 
THIS IS HOPELESS ALL THE SOLDER'S BREAKING UP 
IT'S TOO FAR GONE 
STAN THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THOMAS HAS GOT TO GO 
HE'S JUST TOO BAD FOR YOUR ASTHMA 
SO I WAS THINKING WHY DON'T YOU START BUILDING BRIDGES WITH YOUR NEIGHBOUR 
THAT WOMAN'S COMPLETELY BARMY SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING 
TO DO WITH THE TWO OF YOU FALLING OUT NO 
WELL ALL RIGHT YOU TELL ME THEN A FEW MONTHS BACK SHE WENT OUT FOR THE DAY 
SO I THOUGHT TO MYSELF I'LL GIVE HER A NICE SURPRISE SHE LOVES HER GARDEN 
SO I TAKE MY HEDGE TRIMMER AND TIDY THE PLACE UP A BIT 
YOU'D HAVE EXPECTED A WORD OF THANKS WOULD YOU NOT MAYBE SHE DIDN'T NOTICE 
OH SHE NOTICED ALL RIGHT SHE WENT MAD 
APPARENTLY I'D TRIMMED BACK SOME PLANT OR OTHER 
I TRIED TO EXPLAIN BUT SHE'D HAVE NONE OF IT 
SO I THOUGHT OH WELL LET HER GET ON WITH IT 
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S THE WHOLE STORY IT'S A SMALL THING TO FALL OUT OVER 
IT IS I REMEMBER YOU SAYING SHE USED TO COME ROUND HERE ALL THE TIME WELL WE HAD A LOT IN COMMON 
OF A SUNDAY WE USED TO GO OFF IN HER CAR TO SEE GARDENS TOGETHER 
QUITE REGULARLY SHE'D PROVIDE THE TRANSPORT AND I'D BUY THE TEA AND CAKE 
THAT'S HOW IT WORKED SOUNDS GREAT IT WERE GOOD 
WHY DON'T YOU WRITE HER A NOTE SAY YOU'RE SORRY FOR WHAT'S HAPPENED 
I'M NOT APOLOGISING WHEN I'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG IT'S CALLED 
I KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED IT'S CALLED BEING THE MALE OF THE SPECIES 
GO ON WRITE HER A NOTE 
OH I DON'T KNOW 
I'VE GOT A VISIT TO DO DOWN THE STREET BUT I'LL BE BACK IN HALF AN HOUR 
I CAN POP IT IN FOR YOU IF YOU LIKE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LET THIS DROP ARE YOU NOPE

I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL WHEN WE'VE FINISHED THAT PART OF THE INVESTIGATION 
WHEN WILL THAT BE IT'S HARD TO SAY WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE A STATEMENT
