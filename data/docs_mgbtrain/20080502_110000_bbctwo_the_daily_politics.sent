RANGERS ARE IN THE EUROPEAN FINAL

CABINET MINISTER HAZEL BLEARS

WILLIAM 
HAGUE AND 
LIB DEM 
FRONTBENCHER CHRIS HUHNE 
WE'VE ALSO BE JOINED FOR OUR 
SPECIAL ELECTION COVERAGE BY 
POLITICAL NUMBER CRUNCHER 
EXTRAORDINAIRE PROFESSOR JOHN 
CURTICE WELCOME TO THE SHOW 
SO A BODY BLOW FOR GORDON BROWN AS 
LABOUR POSTS ITS WORST ELECTION 
RESULT FOR AT LEAST FORTY YEARS WORSE 
EVEN THAN TONY BLAIR'S LOW POINT 
FOUR YEARS AGO IN A MOMENT WE'LL 
GET STUCK INTO THE ANALYSIS AND 
REACTION FIRST THOUGH GILES 
DILNOT HAS THE STORY SO FAR 
IN ELECTIONS THERE IS GOOD NIGHT'S 
BAD NIGHTS AND HORROR SHOWS 
RESULTS STILL COMING IN BUT EVEN 
EARLY ON IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR LABOUR 
WERE STARING AT THEIR WORST RESULT 
IN FORTY YEARS IN FACT THE BALLOT 
BOX KICKING IT COMES IN MANY 
GUISES LOSSES OF COUNCILS WELL 
OVER ONE HUNDRED CANCER HAS GONE AND MORE 
CRUCIALLY LABOUR'S VOTE FALLING 
MOST HEAVILY IN ITS TRADITIONAL 
HEARTLANDS THE COURSE THE TEN P. TAX 
RATE THE ECONOMY AND 
IT IS 
CLEAR TO ME THAT THIS HAS BEEN A 
DISAPPOINTING NIGHT INDEED A BAD 
NIGHT FOR LABOUR WE HAVE LESSONS 
TO LEARN FROM THAT AND THEN WE WILL 
MOVE FORWARD MY JOB IS TO 
AND TO LEAD AND THAT IS WHAT I 
WILL DO 
BUT LEADING IN THE POLLS 
THE TORIES WERE BUOYANT THEY HAVE 
WAITED FOR THIS A FEAST THEY HAVE 
WAITED 
FOR THIS 
A FEW SECONDS 
LONGER WASN'T GOING TO HURT 
BOUQUETS FOR THE UNMISTAKABLY TORY 
LADY IN BURY PROVING THEY CAN WIN 
COUNCILS IN THE NORTH AND WINNING 
BACK SOUTHAMPTON FROM A LABOUR LIB 
DEM ALLIANCE DAVID CAMERON REFUSED 
THIS MORNING TO SEE HIMSELF AS THE 
RECIPIENT OF A LABOUR PROTEST VOTE 
I THINK THESE RESULTS ARE POSITIVE 
ENDORSEMENT FOR THE CONSERVATIVE 
PARTY NOT JUST PEOPLE KICKING THE 
GOVERNMENT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE 
OBVIOUSLY DOING THAT TOO 
FOR THE 
LIB DEMS WHO WERE FOUND REASONS TO 
CELEBRATE BUT MAY HAVE WANTED MORE 
NICK CLEGG WAS PROUD BRITISH BRITISH POLITICS IS VERY FLUID AT THE 
MOMENT THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT IS IN 
A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE PEOPLE 
DON'T YET KNOW WHAT DAVID STANDS FOR 
AND SO 
THERE 
IS A GREAT 
DEAL 
TO PAY 
FOR 
I THINK 
THESE 
RESULTS SHOW WE ARE GAINING 
MOMENTUM 
RESULTS ARE LIKE BUSES MOMENTUM YOU WAIT 
AND WAIT 
AND THEN THREE 
COME AT ONCE 
WITH LONDON 
AND OTHER 
STILL 
TO ARRIVE 
THE 
TORIES WILL 
BE 
HOPING IT JUST GETS BETTER LABOUR 
WILL BE PRAYING IT CAN'T GET WORSE 
AS GILES MENTIONED IT'S BEEN RESOUNDINGLY BAD FOR ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES THEY HAVE 
ALSO LOST READING AND WOLVERHAMPTON 
TO NO OVERALL CONTROL 
THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE WON CONTROL 
OF TWELVE COUNCILS 
THEY HAVE ALSO WON NORTH TYNESIDE 
AND REDDITCH THEY GAINED 
THE CONSERVATIVES DID LOSE TO 
CANCERS TO NO OVERALL CONTROL 
THE LIB DEMS GAINED THREE COUNCILS 
JUST IN THE LAST THE MINUTES THEY 
HAVE SNAPPED UP BURNLEY BUT THEY 
DID LOSE TO MACRO COUNCILS TO NO 
OVERALL CONTROL LIVERPOOL AND 
PENDLE THEY LOST WEST LINDSEY TO 
THE TORIES JEREMY VINE HAS BEEN 
KEEPING A TAB ON THE NATIONAL 
PICTURE FOR THE THREE MAIN PARTIES 
WE ARE IN GORDON'S GALLERY COME 
AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE PICTURES 
YOU'LL REMEMBER VINCE CABLE SAYING 
FROM GORDON BROWN HAD GONE FROM 
STALIN TO MR. BEAN THERE HE WAS IN 
CONTROL AT THE 
START OF 
HIS 
PREMIERSHIP AND GRADUALLY THE 
WHEELS STARTED TO COME OFF THERE 
HE IS STARTING TO LOOK RATHER TIRED 
THE CANCELLED ELECTION THE LOST 
DATA DISKS NORTHERN ROCK WE ASKED 
WHETHER HE WAS MR. BEAN BY THE END 
OF LAST NIGHT LET'S GIVE IT SOME 
CLIST QUICK HISTORICAL CONTEXT 
LOOK AT LABOUR TONY BLAIR WON THAT 
ELECTION LANDSLIDE FORTY FOUR PER CENT IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN IT 
TENDED TO COME DOWN FOR LOCAL 
ELECTIONS BACK UP FOR THE TWO THOUSAND ONE 
GENERAL TWO THOUSAND FOUR TONY BLAIR SCORED 
THE RECORD LOW TWENTY SIX PER CENT THE LOWEST IN 
LIVING MEMORY FOR FORTY YEARS OR SO 
AND THAT WAS THE LOWER SCORE THAT 
MR. BLAIR GOT THEN THEY WON THE 
GENERAL IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT IN THE LOCALS 
BROWN WAS BROUGHT IN TO REFRESH AND 
RENEWED TO DO BETTER WHAT 
HAPPENED TWENTY FOUR LOWER THAN MR. BLAIR'S 
LOWEST EVER SO MR. BROWN YOU HAVE 
GONE FROM STALIN TO MR. BEAN WE 
TAKE A LOOK AT OUR PROJECTED 
NATIONAL SHARE FOR ALL THE PARTIES 
THIS IS WHAT THE ELECTION WOULD 
HAVE 
DONE HAD 
IT BEEN PLAYED OUT 
NATIONALLY BASED ON THE LOCAL 
PERFORMANCES WE 
HAVE SEEN IN THE 
LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS THERE IS THAT LABOUR 
HORROR SHOW FOR YOU TWENTY FOUR PER CENT 
CONSERVATIVES THOUGH DOING 
FABULOUSLY WITH A SENSE OF REAL 
MOMENTUM NOW ON FORTY FOUR THE LIB DEMS 
NICK CLEGG LOOKING SHAKY THEY WERE 
ON TWENTY SIX LAST YEAR HE CAN SAY IT HAS 
PUT HIM IN SECOND PLACE BECAUSE 
THEY ARE AHEAD OF LABOUR IS 
TWENTY FIVE TWENTY PER CENT BEHIND LABOUR BEHIND 
CONSERVATIVES CONSERVATIVES HAZEL BLEARS IS THIS SPAT AS BAD 
AS BAD AS IT CAN GET 
I SINCERELY 
HOPE SO THIS WAS A BAD NIGHT FOR 
LABOUR I THINK IT IS ALWAYS GOING 
TO BE DIFFICULT MID TERM ELECTIONS 
THE ECONOMY NOT IN ITS BEST SHAPE 
AND PEOPLE GENUINELY WORRIED ABOUT 
HIGHEST PRICES FOOD PRICES AND ALL 
OF THAT 
BUT THIS ISN'T JUST A BAD 
NIGHT IT IS AN HISTORICALLY BAD 
NIGHT AT LEAST AS BAD AS NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT 
WHICH IS THE WORST OF MODERN RECORD 
WHY SO BAD 
I THINK A COMBINATION 
OF FACTORS TO BE HONEST THE 
ECONOMY RIGHT AT THE HEART OF IT 
PEOPLE DO VOTE ON THE ECONOMY WHAT 
IS IN THEIR POCKET AND HOW THEY 
FEEL I THINK ALSO AS WELL WHEN 
YOU HAVE BEEN IN FOR ELEVEN YEARS THEN 
OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE ARE THINKING IS 
IT TIME FOR A CHANGE THAT IS AN 
IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO US AND THE 
TEN P. TAX RATE GORDON BROWN HAS 
ADMITTED BADLY DEALT WITH 
IT WAS 
OURS AS A GOVERNMENT HE GOT RID OF 
THE TEN P. RATE AFTER INTRODUCING IT 
HE HAS BEEN STRAIGHT UP ABOUT THAT 
MISTAKES MADE THE IMPORTANT THING 
IS THAT YOU DO OWN UP AND YOU SAY 
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT BUT THEN 
YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
WHY DID 
PEOPLE LIKE HIM YOU 
I DON'T 
THINK PEOPLE DON'T LIKE US THEY THEY ARE NOT VOTING FOR YOU 
IT IS NOT 
INDIVIDUALS IT IS HOW THEY FEEL 
HOW THINGS ARE FOR THEM AND THEIR 
FAMILY 
THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY FAMILY GRIM IF ONLY ONE IN FOUR PEOPLE 
VOTED FOR YOU 
AT THE MOMENT 
THINGS ARE TOUGH IF YOU HAVE BEEN 
OUT ON THE STREETS AS I HAVE YOU 
WILL HEAR THAT LOUD AND CLEAR THEY 
WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO 
TO 
DO MORE 
THAN 
THAT TO 
ACT ON 
THE 
CONCERNS THEY HAVE GOT 
EVEN THE 
MAN THEY CALL CALAMITY CLEGG DID 
BETTER LAST WEEK IF HE IS CALAMITY 
WHAT DOES THAT MAKE BROWN 
I THINK 
WE SHOULD TAKE IT ON THE CHIN BUT 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS DIDN'T HAVE A 
GOOD NIGHT EITHER DID THEY 
WILLIAM HAGUE THE DANGER FOR YOU 
BECAUSE INOCENCIO HAVE BEEN HERE 
BEFORE MAYBE NOT TO THIS SCALE 
BUT YOU WIN MID TERM ELECTIONS 
PEOPLE VOTE AGAINST AN UNPOPULAR 
GOVERNMENT BUT WHEN PUSH COMES TO 
SHOVE THEY GO BACK TO THE 
GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL 
NOW BE IN POWER UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TEN 
I DON'T 
THINK YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TO CALL 
A GENERAL ELECTION BEFORE TWO THOUSAND TEN BUT 
WE HAVE NOT BEEN HERE BEFORE NOT 
IN RECENT TIMES FORTY FOUR PER CENT OF THE VOTE 
IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE 
HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING IN MY TERMS 
OF THE LAST AND PREVIOUS PARLIAMENT 
WE WERE WELL BELOW THAT SCHOOL SO 
IT IS NOT JUST LABOUR LOSING VOTES 
THE NET INCREASE IN VOTERS COME 
ENTIRELY TO THE CONSERVATIVES 
THERE IS A POSITIVE VOTE FOR US 
BUT WE ARE NOT SAYING WE HAVE A 
GENERAL ELECTION IN THE BAG WE ARE 
SAYING WE HAVE MADE A STEP FORWARD 
ON PREVIOUS YEARS THIS IS A VERY 
BIG STEP FORWARD BUT WE ARE NOT 
COUNTING ANYTHING 
IN THE 
BAG UNTIL 
THE 
NEXT GENERAL 
ELECTION BUT 
BUT THERE IS POLLING 
EVIDENCE THAT 
PEOPLE ARE 
VOTING AGAINST 
LABOUR 
RATHER THAN FOR YOU THE B. B. C. 
POLLING FOR THE ELECTION PROGRAMME 
SHOWED THAT LABOUR IS STILL MORE 
TRUSTED TO 
RUN THE 
HEALTH SERVICE 
THAN THE CONSERVATIVES MORE PEOPLE 
THINK LABOUR HAVE THE RIGHT 
POLICIES FOR PEOPLE ON LOW INCOME 
EVEN AFTER THE TEN P. BOAT 
THEY ARE 
NOT 
JUST RUSHING 
TO BUT THEY 
RUSHING AWAY FROM HAZEL BLEARS'S 
PARTY 
I THINK THERE IS A MIXTURE PARTY THAT SAME SURVEY PUT THE 
CONSERVATIVES AHEAD 
ON A WIDE RANGE 
OF ISSUES IT IS A MIXTURE PEOPLE 
ARE VERY ANGRY ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT 
I WOULD DISAGREE WITH ONE WORD OF 
PRAISE OR'S PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT 
IS TIME FOR CHANGE RATHER THAN IS 
IT A TIME FOR CHANGE WE ARE 
POSITIVELY DOING WELL TO GAIN 
NORTH TYNESIDE THIS IS THE FIRST 
TIME WE WILL HAVE HAD A MAJORITY 
CONTROL OF THE METROPOLITAN COUNCIL 
IN THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND EVER 
SINCE THESE COUNCILS WERE INVENTED 
SO THIS IS A PRETTY EXCEPTIONAL 
ADVANCE 
CHRIS HUHNE THE LIB DEMS ADVANCE GOT A COUPLE OF CONSOLATION PRIZES 
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS OVERALL IF 
THIS RESULT WAS TRANSLATED INTO A 
GENERAL 
ELECTION YOU 
WOULD LOSE A 
NUMBER 
OF SEATS 
WE 
WILL HAVE 
WAIT AND SEE BECAUSE WHAT I THINK 
NICK HAS DONE IN THE NEW LEADERSHIP 
IS TAKE US FROM THIRTEEN PER CENT ACTUALLY TWELVE PER CENT 
ON AVERAGE 
IN THE 
POLLS AT 
THE 
BEGINNING 
OF THE 
LEADERSHIP 
IN THE MIDDLE OF LAST YEAR TO TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
AND AHEAD OF LABOUR 
AND MORE THAN 
WHAT MING CAMPBELL GOT IN THE 
EQUIVALENT ELECTIONS 
REMEMBER HOW 
FOR DOWN WE WENT SO WE HAVE COME 
UP VERY SUBSTANTIALLY SINCE THAT 
LOW POINT IN 
THE MIDDLE 
OF LAST 
YEAR 
I THINK 
IT IS TESTAMENT TO 
NICK'S LEADERSHIP AND THE SOLIDITY 
OF THE RECOVERY AND WE 
HAVE GOT 
SOME 
VERY GOOD 
RESULTS AND 
SOME 
AND SOME BAD ONES PROFESSOR IS THERE 
EVIDENCE THAT LIB DEM VOTES HAVE 
BEEN MOVING TO THE TORIES 
CERTAINLY WHAT ONE CAN SAY IS THAT 
FOR THE MOST PART THE LIB DEMS HAVE 
BEEN LOSING IN THE TRADE WITH THE 
CONSERVATIVES THE CONSERVATIVES 
SEEM TO HAVE GAINED MORE SEEDS FROM 
THE LIB DEMS AND VICE VERSA THE 
LIB DEMS HAVE GAINED MORE SEATS 
FROM LABOUR THAN THEY HAVE LOST 
THAT PARTLY 
HELPS 
TO EXPLAIN 
THE LIB 
DEMS ARE 
COMING UP MORE 
LESS EVEN STEVENS IT HIDES 
CHANGE IN WHERE THEY ARE GAINING 
AND LOSING THEY ARE LOSING GROUND 
TO THE STORIES AND GAINING TO THE 
TORIES AND GAINING FROM LABOUR IS IS THERE AN OVERALL SENSE AS WE LOOK 
AROUND THE COUNTRY WOULD IT BE 
ACCURATE TO SAY THE SUBURBS ARE NOW 
GOING TORY 
I DON'T THINK THAT IS 
THE KEY MESSAGE L. THINK THE KEY 
MESSAGE IS THAT THIS IS A 
NATIONWIDE INCREASE IN THE 
CONSERVATIVE VOTE THOSE GAINS IN 
NORTH TYNESIDE AND BURY ARE NOT 
EXCEPTIONS THEY ARE THE RULE 
BASICALLY THE CONSERVATIVE VOTE IS 
UP FOUR PER CENT ON AVERAGE IN THOSE WARDS 
THERE WERE CONTESTED THIS YEAR AND 
LAST YEAR AND IT IS 
UP FOUR PER CENT 
IN THE 
NORTH IN THE MIDLANDS AND FOUR PER CENT IN 
THE SOUTH GEOGRAPHICALLY THIS IS 
EVEN THAT STILL LEAVES THE TORIES 
WEEK IN 
THE NORTH 
AND 
IN THE 
SOUTH 
BUT THEY 
ARE NOW GAINING ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY FOR ME THE ICONIC 
STATISTIC I WOULD GIVE THE THE 
NEW PARLIAMENTARY CONSTITUENCY OF 
SUNDERLAND CENTRAL THE 
CONSERVATIVES WERE TEN POINTS AHEAD 
LAST NIGHT ON THE VOTE IN THAT NEW 
CONSTITUENCY IF THE CONSERVATIVES 
CAN STOP WINNING PARLIAMENTARY 
CONSTITUENCIES IN SUNDERLAND THEY 
ARE BEGINNING TO SPREAD BACK INTO 
THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
WE MAY HAVE 
TO GO AND LIE DOWN IN A DARK ROOM 
TO CONTEMPLATE THAT 
LET'S GET THE LATEST FROM SOME OF 
OUR CORRESPONDENTS AT THE KEY 
COUNTS AROUND THE COUNTRY CAROLINE 
RICHARDSON IS IN READING WHAT'S 
THE SITUATION THERE 
READING IT WAS 
LAST LABOUR CONTROLLED COUNCIL IN 
THE WHOLE OF THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND 
BUT AN HOUR AGO THEY LOST OVERALL 
CONTROL THAT'S TWENTY YEARS OF LABOUR 
INFLUENCE GONE OVERNIGHT ANOTHER 
NAIL IN THE COP FIN OF A DISASTROUS 
NIGHT'S PERFORMANCE BY BROWN'S 
GOVERNMENT A FEW CRUMBS OF COMFORT 
THEY ARE STILL THE LARGEST PARTY 
ON THE COUNCIL BUT AN 
EMBARRASSMENT TOO THAT THE LABOUR 
LEADER HAS LOST HIS SEAT ELSEWHERE 
THE TORIES TOOK OVERALL CONTROL OF 
SOUTHAMPTON A SURPRISE TO 
THEMSELVES WHEN THEY TOPPLED THE 
LABOUR LEADER AND THEN THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRAT LEADER THERE WAS A 
PALPABLE FRISSON OF EXCITEMENT 
THROUGH THE GUILDHALL A RESOUNDING 
VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN THE 
SOUTHAMPTON VOTERS IN THE LABOUR 
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LINES 
MARK DENTON IS IN BLYTHE THE 
LATEST RESULTS SHOW THE TORIES HAVE 
WON NORTH TYNESIDE YES THAT'S THE 
DRAMATIC STORY NORTH TYNESIDE 
GOING FROM KNOW OVERALL CONTROL TO 
A COUNCIL THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE 
GAINED LOTS OF CELEBRATIONS ONE 
CAVEAT ABOUT THAT THERE IS A 
LABOUR ELECTED MAYOR IN NORTH 
TYNESIDE SO THE CONSERVATIVES 
WON'T HAVE IT ALL THEIR OWN WAY IN 
TERMS OF POLICY IN THAT AREA WE 
ARE IN BLYTHE WHERE A UNITYRY 
COUNCIL IS BEING ELECTED ALREADY 
THE INDICATIONS ARE THE LIB DEMS 
ARE DOING RATHER WELL HERE ELSE 
WHERE IS IN THIS REGION WHICH 
SHOULD BE ROCK SOLID LABOUR GAINS 
FOR THE CONSERVATIVES IN SUNDERLAND 
AND EMBARRASSMENT IN SOUTH TYNESIDE 
WHERE THE LABOUR LEADER LOST HIS 
SEAT TO AN INDEPENDENT THEY ARE 
STILL COUNTING IN NEWCASTLE WHAT 
USED TO BE A GIVEN LABOUR'S 
SUCCESS IN THE NORTH EAST IS NOT A 
GIVEN ANY MORE 
YOU MENTIONED THE LIB DEMS LEN 
TINGLE IS IN SHEFFIELD NICK 
CLEGG'S BACK YARD WHAT'S THE 
SITUATION THERE 
IT WOULDN'T BE TOO 
MUCH OF A CLISH SAY TO SAY THAT 
SHEFFIELD THE STEEL CITY IS ON A 
KNIFE EDGE FORTY THREE IS THE MAGIC NUMBER 
FOR A MAJORITY YOU CAN HEAR THE 
RESULTS ARE STILL COMING IN SO IT 
IS TOO CLOSE TO TELL BUTS CLEAR 
LABOUR'S BEING SQUEEZED THEY'VE 
LOST ONE SEAT LOST ONE SEAT TO THE 
GREENS BUT THEY HAVE ALSO LOST A 
COUPLE OF SEATS TO THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
ARE A COUPLE OF SEATS CLOSER TO 
THAT MAGIC FORTY THREE WHICH WOULD GIVE 
THEM OVERALL CONTROL FOR QUITE A 
LONG TIME WITH THEY WILL MAKE IT 
IS ANOTHER MATTER 
LEN TINGLE 
THANK YOU 
STEEL CITY KNIFE EDGE L. WISH I HAD 
THOUGHT OF THAT IT'S THE WAY HE 
TELLS THEM 
JUST BECAUSE YOU WON LAST NIGHT 
DON'T GET OVER HAZEL BLEARS HOW 
BAD DOES IT HAVE TO GET BEFORE YOU 
CHANGE LEADER THIS IS ABOUT 
POLICIES NOT 
PERSONALITIES 
POLICIES NOT PERSONALITIES REALLY 
IN THE 
CONSTITUENCY GORDON 
BROWN LIVES IN THAT'S NOW LIB DEM 
HIS OLD UNIVERSITY CITY IS NOW 
CONTROLLED BY THE SCOTTISH 
NATIONALISTS AND BY TEND OF THE DAY 
IT IS LIKELY THE CAPITAL WILL BE 
RUN BY THE TORIES WHY IS HE A 
TOXIC EFFECT ON THE VOTERS 
HE IS 
THE KING OF SCOTLAND AND HE LOST IT 
TO THE NATIONALISTS HE LOOKS LIKE 
LOSING LONDON TO THE TORIES AND HIS 
CITY TO THE LIB DEMS SO WHERE IS 
THE GOOD NEWS IN THIS 
MY TOP 
PRIORITY IS POLICIES FOR 
POLITICIANS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IT IS 
ABOUT DOING WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT 
TOW DO AND BEING IN TOUCH WITH THEM 
THERE IS IT'S BEEN A GOOD NIGHT 
FOR THE CONSERVATIVES BUT THINK 
ABOUT MANCHESTER NOT A SINGLE SEAT 
ON MANCHESTER CITY COUNCIL A BIG 
NORTHERN SEAT HARDLY MADE ANY 
PROGRESS IN BOLTON ONE OF THE 
PLACES THAT THE TORIES WANT TO DO 
DO WELL I'M NOT SAYING THIS HAS 
BEEN ANY GOOD NIGHT FOR LABOUR 
JUST AS WELL OR THE MEN IN WHITE 
COATS WOULD COME AND GET YOU BIG 
WHITE COAT AS WELL WE HAVE TO MOVE 
ON ON OF COURSE WE WON'T KNOW THE 
RESULTS OF 
TODAY BUT THE RESULT OF THE KEN 
VERSUS BORIS SHOWDOWN IN LONDON 
WILL EITHER GIVE DAVID CAMERON 
ANOTHER BOOST OR GIVE SOME SORT OF 
COMFORT TO GORDON BROWN JEREMY 
VINE'S BEEN KEEPING AN EYE ON THE 
LONDON BUST UP 
WELL WELCOME TO OUR CARTOON WE 
HAVE USED SOME DRAWINGS TO BRING 
THE LONDON MAYORAL CHARACTERS TO 
LIFE IT IS NOT AS IF THEY ARE NOT 
LIVELY ENOUGH ALREADY WHAT WERE 
THEIR NAMES CAN YOU REMEMBER IF 
RED KEN AND LORD 
NUMBER Y. JOHNSON AND THE LIB DEM 
CANDIDATE P. C. PADDICK AND SHOE HAVE 
SEEN EARLIER SOMEONE MENTIONED THE 
CONGESTION CHARGE AND IT ALL KICKED 
OFF HE'S PICKED UP A BENDY BUS 
THINK BORIS JOHNSON TOOK ONE IN THE 
I. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE COUNT 
RESULTS YET SO WE WILL TELL YOU 
ABOUT THE POLL IN THIS THE RUN UP 
TO THE CONTEST MARCH THESE 
BETTER INTERNET POLLS THEY PUT 
BORIS JOHNSON A MILE AHEAD IN 
APRIL WITH MORE CONVENTIONAL POLLS 
SUGGESTED KEN LIVINGSTONE WAS 
FRACTIONALLY IN THE LEAD SO IN THE 
ABSENCE OEMP ANY RESULTS WE ARE 
LEFT WONDERING WHETHER LORD 
NUMBER Y. WOULD HAVE BEEN BUOYED UP BY THE 
LORD 
NUMBER Y. HAVE 
PROFESSOR JOHN CURTICE CAN YOU 
GIVE US ANY IDEA OF WHO MIGHT WIN 
THE BIG BORIS KEN CONTEST 
AT TIMES 
LIKE THIS PSEPHOLOGISTS ARE 
GRATEFUL FOR ANY CRUMBS THEY CAN 
GET AND WE HAVE TWO BY ELECTIONS 
THAT WERE HELD FOR BOROUGH COUNCIL 
IN THIS LONDON LAST NIGHT ONE IN 
BARNET AND ONE IN HAMMERSMITH AND 
THEY BOTH SHOW A THREE PER CENT SWING SINCE 
TWO THOUSAND SIX WHEN THEY LAST WENT TO THE 
CONSERVATIVES IF THAT'S TYPICAL 
REMEMBER THE CONSERVATIVES WERE 
AHEAD IN LONDON IN TWO THOUSAND SIX SIX OR SEVEN 
POINTS THAT POINTS TO THE 
CONSERVATIVES HAVING AS MUCH AS A 
DOUBLE DIGIT LEAD IN LONDON BUT 
WHY WE ARE ALL ON TENTERHOOKS ABOUT 
LONDON IS IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THE CONSERVATIVES 
WON THE ASSEMBLY ELECTION BUT KEN 
LIVINGSTONE WAS STILL ELECTED AS 
MAYOR WE ARE IN A SITUATION NOW 
WHERE THE ONLY PERSON WHO STANDS 
BETWEEN GORDON BROWN AND UNALLOYED 
DISASTER IS PERHAPS KEN 
LIVINGSTONE'S PERSONAL POPULARITY 
EVEN TEN DOWNING STREET DOESN'T SEEM 
TO HAVE TOO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HIM 
THIS MORNING 
IF THAT IS THE WAY 
THE CAPITAL CITY IS GOING IS THAT 
GOING TO BE A BOOST FOR DAVID 
CAMERON OR SIT LETTING LOOSE A 
POTENTIAL LOOSE CANNON IN BORIS 
JOHNSON HE WOULD BE CONTROLLING 
ONE OF THE MAJOR CITIES IN THE 
WORLD AND WE KNOW HE LIKES THE ODD 
GAFFE 
HE LIKES A GOOD RURBLGTS WE GAFFE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE RESULT IS 
RESULT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE 
RESULT IS WE ARE NOT PRESUMING 
ANYTHING WE ARE CAUTIOUSLY 
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT IT WHITE BE A 
GREAT RESULT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT 
MANY MONTHS SINCE PEOPLE THOUGHT IT 
WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT KEN 
LIVINGSTONE WITH ANY CONSERVATIVE 
CANDIDATE SO TO MAKE IT A TIGHT 
RACE IS A BIG SUCCESS L. HAVE NO 
FEAR ABOUT BORIS MAKING GAFFES 
I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR TWENTY YEARS AND HE 
IS A BRILLIANT MAN HE WOULD BRING 
HONESTY AND FRESH THINKING TO THE 
JOB OF LONDON MAYOR 
HAZEL BLEARS 
IF BORIS WINS ANOTHER BLOW FOR 
GORDON BROWN HOW DOES HE PULL IT 
BACK NEXT WEEK THE WEEK AFTER 
DOES HE HAVE A RESHUFFLE AN 
ONSLAUGHT OF NEW POLICIES WHAT IS 
HE PLANNING TO DO 
I DON'T THINK IT 
IS ABOUT NEW FACES WHEN THE PUBLIC 
GIVE YOU A MESSAGE LIKE THIS THEY 
ARE SAYING TO YOU YOU HAVE GOT TO 
LISTEN TO OUR DAY TO DAY CONCERNS 
ON THE ECONOMY MAKING SURE YOU GET 
THE EDUCATION RIGHT AND EDUCATION 
CONTINUES TO IMPROVE 
SO POLICIES 
RATHER THAN A RESHUFFLE 
IF YOU 
THINK ABOUT BORIS A LITTLE WHILE 
AGAIN WHEN FLFRS A REFERENDUM DO 
YOU LIKE KEN LIVINGSTONE BORIS WAS 
MILES AHEAD WHEN IT CAME TO THE 
VOTE TRANSPORT CRIME AND POLICY 
ISSUES THE POLLS CLOSED 
DRAMATICALLY THE TORIES HAD A GOOD 
NIGHT BUT THEIR POLICIES WILL BE 
EXAMINED IN THE WAY THAT OURS ARE 
AND RIGHTLY SO AND I THINK THERE 
WILL BE A LOT LACKING 
SIX OR SEVEN 
HOURS BEFORE WE KNOW THE RESULTS 
I DON'T LIKE THE IMPLICATION WE 
DON'T SCRUTINISE TORY POLICIES 
WHEN WE FIND THEM THEY SCRUTINISE 
THEM JAMES LANDALE IS BY THE 
THAMES THE WORD FROM DOWNING 
STREET IS THAT KEN HAS LOST THE 
TORIES THINK BORIS HAS WON IS THIS 
READING THE TEA LEAVES OR IS THERE 
ANYTHING SUBSTANTIVE TO BACK THIS 
UP 
TWO THING THING REALLY ONE UP THE CONSERVATIVES ARE BASING IT ON 
THE SCALE OF THE TURNOUT THEY KNOW 
HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE SUBURBS OF 
LONDON THE CONSERVATIVES I'VE 
SPOKEN TO ARE TALKING ABOUT A BORIS 
WIN OF FOUR PER CENT OVER KEN LIVINGSTONE IS 
SECOND FACT BEHIND ME I HAVE 
MARVELLOUS SCREEN WHICH IS TELL ME 
HOW THE COUNT'S GOING SO FAR THREE 
LOCATIONS AROUND THE CAPITAL OF 
TWENTY PER CENT OF THE VOTES COUNTED SO FAR 
OUT OF THE FOURTEEN CONSTITUENCY IN THIS 
LONDON BORIS IS AHEAD IN TEN KEN 
LIVINGSTONE IS AHEAD IN FOUR 
THAT'S AN EARLY INDICATION OF HOW 
MATERIALY RESULTS ARE COMING IN 
THANK YOU JAMES 
THE CONSENSUS THIS MORNING IS THAT 
JOHNSON SKWHRONS BE THE NEW MAYOR 
IN LONDON BUT THEN IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT THE 
CONSENSUS WAS THAT DOCTOR DEWEY WOULD 
BE THE NEW PRESIDENT AND IT WAS MR. 
TRUMAN 
I THINK WE CALL THAT A WASH

LOSSES THE B. B. C.'S OWEN CLARKE IS IN

MESSAGE IS GET GRIP SORT THINGS
