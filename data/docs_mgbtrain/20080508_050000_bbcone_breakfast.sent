SHOCKING AMOUNT OF UNOPENED FOOD 
SIMPLY CHUCKED AWAY EACH DAY 
GOOD MORNING IT'S THURSDAY EIGHTH 
MAY ALSO AHEAD THE B. B. C. UNCOVERS A 
LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWS FOREIGN 
WORKERS TO BY PASS CRUCIAL SECURITY 
CHECKS AT BRITAIN'S AIRPORTS 
A UN RELIEF TEAM COULD ARRIVE IN 
BURMA TODAY AS THE DEATH TOLL 
CONTINUES TO CRIME BROTHERS IN 
ARMS WE HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE 
INTERVIEW WITH FOUR FAMILY MEMBERS 
ABOUT TO SERVE TOGETHER IN IRAQ 
AND WE WILL BE LOOKING AT REPORTS 
THAT THE CARPHONE WAREHOUSE WILL 
TODAY BE RECEIVING A ONE BILLION 
INVESTMENT FROM ITS U. S. BACKER BEST 
BUY BUY AND WE ARE IN MANCHESTER COUNTING 
DOWN THE DAYS TO THE BEIJING 
OLYMPIC GAMES AND OF COURSE THE 
PARALYMPIC GAMES THIS IS THE 
BASKETBALL ARENA FOR THE PARALYMPIC 
WORLD CUP 
AND IN WEATHER ANOTHER WARM AND 
SUNNY DAY FOR THE BULK OF THE 
BRITISH ISLES HOWEVER CHANGES 
AFOOT IN THE SOUTH WEST WITH 
SHOWERY RAIN LATER 
MORE IN FIFTEEN MINUTES FIRST OUR MAIN 
STORY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND READY MEALS MORE 
THAN FIVE THOUSAND WHOLE CHICKENS SO 
PERFECTLY GOOD FOOD CHUCKED OUT BY 
BRITISH FAMILIES EVERY DAY 
ACCORDING TO NEW RESEARCH WE ARE 
THROWING AWAY TEN BILLION OF FOOD 
EVERY YEAR MUCH OF IT UNTOUCHED 
AND NOT EVEN PASSED ITS SELL BUY 
DATE TIM MUFFET IS IN WINCHESTER 
WELL IT IS SOMETHING LET'S FACE IT 
WE HAVE ALL DONE YOU GO SHOPPING 
BUNG YOUR FOOD IN THE FRIDGE AND A 
FEW DAYS OR WEEKS LATER YOU COME 
BACK AND THINK I NEVER GOT AROUND 
TO EATING THAT AND CHUCK IT IN THE 
BIN HOW MUCH COLLECTIVELY DO WE 
THROW AWAY WELL YOU MIGHT BE 
SURPRISED IT IS NOT JUST THE COST 
OF FOOD THAT'S GOING UP SO IT 
SEEMS IS THE AMOUNT WE SIMPLY THROW 
AWAY TEN BILLION WORTH EACH YEAR 
ACCORDING TO WRAP THE GOVERNMENT 
FUNDED WASTE AND RESOURCES ACTION 
PROGRAMME RESEARCHERS LITERALLY 
WENT THROUGH PEOPLE'S BINS TO 
DISCOVER NOT JUST THE VOLUME OF 
FOOD THROWN AWAY BUT ALSO THE 
DIFFERENT TYPES SO FOR EXAMPLE 
UNOPENED YOGHURT POTS IT IS 
THOUGHT AROUND THIRTEEN MILLION ARE 
THROWN INTO OUR BINS EVERY DAY 
FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WHOLE CHICKENS NEVER MAKE IT 
OUT OF THEIR PACKAGING AND INTO THE 
OVEN AND THEY MIGHT BE CONVENIENT 
BUT IT IS THOUGHT FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND READY 
MEALS EACH DAY END UP UNUSED 
UNEATEN AND IN THE BIN 
I THINK 
MOST PEOPLE WILL BE VERY SHOCKED 
THE FIGURES ARE ASTONISHING L. 
THINK PEOPLE WILL THEN WANT TO DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT WILL BE 
THINGS LIKE PLANNING MORE CAREFULLY 
LOOKING MORE AT THE STORAGE 
INFORMATION AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE 
THEY STORE FOOD CORRECTLY AND THEN 
MAKING SURE THEY USE IT BEFORE IT 
GOES OUT OF DATE 
BUT AS EMITE 
KNOWS THAT IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE 
A BUSY MUM SHE FINDS HERSELF 
THROWING TOOD AWAY EVERY WEEK WHEN WHEN YOU GO TO THE SUPERMARKET YOU GO 
FOR A PIBT OF MILK AND BREAD IT IS 
IMPOSSIBLE TO COME BACK WITH THOSE 
YOU BUY SOME APPLES OR YOU BUY THE 
CRECHE CREAM CAKE BECAUSE IT IS 
THERE AND PRESENT SOD WELL WELL WELL THESE ARE PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY 
FIGURES HOW WERE THEY RAY RIEFD 
AT WELL WRAP THE ORGANISATION 
RESPONSIBLE SAY THEY LOOK ED AT THE 
BINS OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN WALES AND 
THEY HAVE EXTRAP LAITED THAT FIGURE 
FOR THE U. K. AS A WHOLE THE 
DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT THINK IT 
IS A FAIR REPRESENTATION OF HOW 
MUCH FOOD IS BEING THROWN AWAY 
LATER THIS MORNING A MORE DETAILED 
REPORT WILL BE PUBLISHED WITH MORE 
INFORMATION IN THAT ALTHOUGH IT 
DOES SEEM MOST FAMILIES WITH 
CHILDREN ARE THROWING AWAY SIX HUNDRED 
WORTH OF FOOD EVERY DAY THIS 
KITCHEN THIS WELSH FAMILY THEY 
ARE PRETTY GOOD LATER WE WILL BE 
CHATTING TO THEM TO GET TOP TIPS ON 
HOW TO LESSON THE AMOUNT OF FOOD 
THROWN IN THE BIN IN OTHER NEWS A 
B. B. C. INVESTIGATION HAS REVEALED 
FOREIGN CRIMINALS COULD BE WORKING 
IN RESTRICTED ZONES IN BRITAIN'S 
AIRPORTS BECAUSE OF A LOOPHOLE IN 
VETTING RULES 
OFFENCES COMMITTED ABROAD AREN'T 
COVERED IN THE CHECKS THE 
CONSERVATIVES HAVE CALLED ON 
SECURITY CHECKS TO BE CARRIED OUT 
ON ALL STAFF 
IT IS FUND AMENTAL PART OF THE 
GOVERNMENT'S PLAN TO KEEP AIR 
PASSENGERS SAFE IF OFF CRIMINAL 
RECORD YOU CAN'T WORK AIRSIDE IT 
IS A SIMPLE RULE WITH A WORRYING 
LOOPHOLE FOREIGN WORKERS AREN'T 
SUBJECT TO THE SAME CONTROLS AS 
THOSE IN THE U. K. ANY OFFENCES 
COMMITTED ABROAD WON'T SHOW UP IN A 
CURRENT CRIMINAL RECORDS CHECK THE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'LL TAKE TOO LONG 
AND BE TOO COMPLEX TO CHECK 
CRIMINAL RECORDS OVERSEAS NOW 
THERE ARE CALLS FOR URGENT CHANGE 
THEY SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CARRY OUT 
SECURITY CHECKS AND ALL PEOPLE 
CURRENTLY WORKING AIRSIDE ANYBODY 
WHO FAILS SHOULD BE REMOVED AND 
BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE IS EMPLOYED 
THOSE SECURITY CHECKS SHOULD BE 
COMPLETED AND THEY SHOULD DO THAT 
IRRESPECTIVE OF COST AND AS FAST AS 
CAN BE DONE OTHERWISE IT IS WORSE 
THAN COMPLACENT IT IS RECKLESS 
AROUND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WORK AIRSIDE 
AT AIRPORTS ACROSS THE U. K. THE 
AIRPORT OPERATOR B. A. A. WON'T CONFIRM 
HOW MANY ARE FOREIGN NATIONALS BUT 
IT IS THOUGHT THE NUMBER RUNS INTO 
THOUSANDS THE GOVERNMENT DENIES 
ITS POLICY IS PUTTING PASSENGERS AT 
RISK 
THE ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE IN RISK PLACE WE BELIEVE ARE APPROPRIATE 
HOWEVER WE HAVE ASKED SIR STEVEN 
BOYCE SMITH TO REVIEW THE 
ARRANGEMENTS AND IF WE NEED TO 
UPGRADE THEM WE WILL I'M IN THE 
EVERYTHING IS MER EFFECT THAT 
WOULD BE FOOLISH OF ME 
EVERYTHING IS PERFECT 
BUT THERE 
ARE UNLIKELY TO BE IMMEDIATE 
CHANGES IN THE WAY AIRPORT WORKERS 
ARE SCREENED THAT REVIEW WON'T BE 
COMPLETED UNTIL THE SUMMER 
A UNITED NATIONS RELIEF TEAM IS 
FINALLY DUE TO ARRIVE IN BURMA 
TODAY FIVE DAYS AFTER THE CYCLONE 
WHICH HAS KILLED TEN OF THOUSANDS 
OF PEOPLE 
BUT U. S. OFFICIALS SAY AIRCRAFT FULL 
OF VITAL SUPPLIES FOR SURVIVORS IS 
STILL WAITING FOR PERMISSION TO 
LAND LAND IT IS WARNED THE FINAL DEATH TOLL 
COULD BE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND WE WILL GET THE 
LATEST IN HALF AN HOUR 
A MAN HAS DIED AND TWO PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN TAKEN TO HOSPITAL AFTER A 
SUSPECTED GAS EXPLOSION ON A 
RESIDENTIAL STREET IN HARROW IN 
NORTH WEST LONDON THE EXPLOSION 
WHICH HAPPENED LAST NIGHT 
DESTROYED TWO HOUSES ABOUT FORTY 
PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED FROM THEIR 
HOMES EMERGENCY SERVICES SPENT 
HOURS SEARCHING THE RUBBLE AND AN 
INVESTIGATION HAS BEGUN INTO WHAT 
CAUSED THE BLAST AMY WINEHOUSE HAS 
BEEN RELEASED ON BAIL AFTER BEING 
QUESTIONED BY POLICE ABOUT ALLEGED 
DRUG OFFENCES MUCH THE SINGER 
VOLUNTARILY ATTENDED AN EAST LONDON 
POLICE STATION SHE WAS ARRESTED 
OVER FOOTAGE PUBLISHED IN JANUARY 
WHICH APPEARED TO SHOW HER SMOKING 
CRACK COCAINE 
PRINCES WILLIAM AND HARRY ATTENDED 
AN OPEN AIR TRIBUTE TO BRITAIN'S 
ARMED FORCES LAST NIGHT AT SAINT 
PAUL'S CATHEDRAL THERE WAS A 
CEREMONY SPEECH AND MUSIC THE 
MONEY RAISED WILL GO TOWARDS 
REHABILITATION PROJECTS FOR INJURED 
MILITARY PERSONNEL AROUND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
CHILDREN IN BRITAIN BETWEEN THE 
AGES OF FIVE AND SEVEN REGULARLY TO STAY SAFE 
YOUNG PEOPLE HOW TO STAY SAFE ONLINE ONLINE WE TEACH OUR CHILDREN TO CROSS THE 
ROAD SAFELY BUT WHEN THEY TAKE 
THEIR FIRST STEPS INTO CYBERSPACE 
THEY ARE OFTEN ON THEIR OWN NOW 
AFTER REQUESTS FROM TEACHERS 
ALARMED AT THE YOUNG CHILDREN 
SURFING THE WEB WITHOUT SUPERVISION 
A NEW CAMPAIGN IS BEING LAUNCHED TO 
HELP EDUCATE CHILDREN TO STAY SAFE 
ONLINE 
I THINK A WILL THE OF ONLINE PARENTS AREN'T AWARE IN THE HOME 
WHAT CHILDREN ARE DOING ON THE 
INTERNET IF IT COMES FROM SCHOOLS 
IT IS PROBABLY TAKEEN MORE 
SERIOUSLY 
PARENTS CAN STOP THEIR SERIOUSLY CHILDREN TALKING TO STRANGERS IN 
THE STREET THE PROBLEM IS STOPPING 
THEM TALKING TO STRANGERS WHO COME 
INTO THEIR OWN HOME VIA THE 
INTERNET INTERNET AT THE CENTRE OF THE NEW CAMPAIGN 
IS THE CARTOON CHARACTER HEGTOR 
THE DOLPHIN HE AND HIS FRIEND 
LEARN TO SURF SAFELY THROUGH THE 
INTERNET OCEAN 
WE DON'T WANT IT 
SCARE CHILDREN OF THIS AGE GROUP 
WHAT THEY ARE DOING ONLINE IS 
DIFFERENT WE TAKE A SOFTER 
APPROACH LOOK AT STRANGER DANGER 
MESSAGES AND LOOK AT THE PERSONAL 
INFORMATION THEY ARE PUTTING ONLINE 
AND WE HAVE CREATED A CARTOON WHICH 
IDENTIFIES WITH WHAT THEY FEEL 
MOST CHILDREN KNOW THEY SHOULDN'T 
TALK TO STRANGERS IN THE STREET 
NOT TALKING TO STRANGERS WHO COME 
INTO THEIR HOMES VIA THE INTERNET 
ISN'T SO OBVIOUS AND IT IS HOPED 
HECTOR AND HIS FRIENDS WILL GET 
THAT MESSAGE ACROSS 
ABOUT ONE IN ONE HUNDRED CHILDREN IN 
BRITAIN ARE FEATED BY AUTISM BUT 
THERE ARE NO FIGURES FOR THE NUMBER 
OF ADULT SUFFERERS ARE AFFECTED 
BY AUTISM NOW BECAUSE OF FEARS 
THEY ARE ABANDONED ABOUT SOCIAL 
SERVICES THE GOVERNMENT IS TO PAY 
FOR RESEARCH TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH 
ADULTS HAVE THE CONDITION PETER 
GRIFFIN IS TWENTY EIGHT NEXT WEEK BUT HE'S 
NEVER LEFT HOME HE CAN'T 
DO YOU 
HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED 
PETER HAS 
ASPERGEERS SYNDROME A FORM OF 
AUTISM HE HAS A DESTRO IN 
ASTROPHYSICS BUT HIS HIGH INTELLECT 
CAN MASK PROBLEMS 
AT THE MOMENT 
I'M NOT COMPETENT IN CERTAIN AREAS 
LIKE COOKING AND MONEY MANAGEMENT 
TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY THE BIG 
PROBLEM IS I HAVE AN ERRATIC SLEEP 
PROBLEM AS WELL 
RESEARCH SUGGESTS 
ONE IN ONE HUNDRED CHILDREN HAS AUTISM BUT 
UNTIL NOW THERE HAS BEEN NO 
EQUIVALENT STUDY FOR ADULTS WHEN 
WE THINK OF AUTISM WE OFTEN THINK 
ONLY OF CHILDREN BUT IT IS A LIFE 
LONG DISABILITY WITH NO CURE BUT 
PARTLY BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE 
GROWN UP UNDIAGNOSED WE DON'T KNOW 
HOW MANY ADULTS WITH AUTISM THERE 
ARE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS 
CALCULATING HOW MANY ADULTS THERE 
ARE SIMILAR TO PEATER IS KEY TO 
GETTING THEM THE RIGHT SUPPORT TO 
LEAD FULL LIVES SIMILAR TO PETER 
A RECRUITMENT CAMPAIGN IS BEING 
LAUNCHED ACROSS BRITAIN TODAY TO 
FIND NEW ASTRONAUTS MUCH THE 
EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY IS OFFERING 
PEOPLE THE CHANCE TO TAKE PART IN 
MISSIONS TO THE MOON AND TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION THERE 
IS CONCERN THAT BRITISH HOPEFULS 
ONE OF WHICH WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO 
LATER WILL BE AT A DISADVANTAGE 
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT ISN'T 
PROVIDING FUNDING TO THE HUMAN 
SPACE PROGRAMME 
CHINESE MOUNTAIN YEARS HAVE TAKEN 
AN LICH LIMP TORCH TO THE TOP OF 
MOUNT EVEREST THREE MONTHS BEFORE 
THE OLYMPIC GAMES BEGIN AN 
OLYMPIC TORCH PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS 
FAILED BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER ONE 
MAN SAID IT WAS A GESTURE OF PEACE 
AND HARMONY 
IT WAS A DIFFERENT TORCH FROM THE 
ONES IN LONDON IN PARIS HOW THEY 
KEPT IT ALIGHT IS EVERYBODY'S GUESS 
DO THEY KEEP LIGHTERS NO YOU

PLAY BASKETBALL

ROUGH WHY ARE WE HERE WELL WE 
HAVE FORTY ODD COUNTRIES OVER FOUR HUNDRED 
ATHLETES HERE AT THE PARALYMPIC 
WORLD CUP ALL GETTING READY FOR THE 
BEIJING OLYMPIC GAMES BUT LOOK AT 
THE BUDING YOUNG ATHLETES AREN'T

FIRST STARTING WITH RANGERS 
DESPITE A FIXTURE PILE UP THEY ARE 
GOING WELL THEY BEAT MOTHERWELL ONE 
ZERO NSPL AND HAVE CLOSED THE GAP 
AGAINST CELTIC 
BARRY FERGUSON SCORED THE ONLY GOAL 
THEY ARE CHASING FOUR TROPHIES AND 
FACE ANOTHER FOUR LEAGUE GAMES AND 
TWO CUP FINALS IN THE NEXT SEVENTEEN DAYS 
THEY HAVE THE BACKING OF THE 
SCOTLAND MANAGER GEORGE BURLEY WHO 
HAS CRITICISED THE SPL'S REFUSAL TO 
EXTEND THE DOMESTIC SEASON 
B. B. C. SPORT HAS LEARNED THAT SVEN 
GORAN ERIKSSON HAS HAD TALKS IN 
MANCHESTER WITH THE PORTUGESE CLUB 
BEN FEIA HIS POSITION AS 
MANCHESTER CITY MANAGER IS 
UNCERTAIN BENFICA 
THAKSIN SHINAWTRA SAYS A DECISION 
WILL BE TAKEN AT THE END OF THE 
SEASON IF ERIKSSON GOES BACK TO 
THE LISBON CLUB IT WILL BE HIS 
THIRD SPELL THERE 
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE RICHARD SCUDAMORE HAS 
LAUNCHED STRONG DEFENCE OF THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE DESPITE KEVIN 
KEEGAN'S CRITICISM SAYING IT WAS 
BORING KEEGAN'S COMMENTS CAME 
AFTER HIS SIDE LOST TWO TO ZERO TO CHELSEA 
THISS WHAT SCUDAMORE HAD TO SAY HE HE HAS JUST GONE THROUGH THE HEAT OF 
BATTLE AND COMPETED VERY WELL FOR 
SIXTY MINUTES THINKING HE HAS A 
CHANCE OF WINNING AND ALL OF A 
SUDDEN THE POWER PLAY COMES ON HE 
LOSES TWO TO ZERO A MICROPHONE GOES UNDER 
HIS NOSE STRAIGHT AFTER THE MATCH 
HE SAID SOMETHING I THINK AFTER 
REFLECTION PROBABLY HE WILL I AM 
IN THE SAYING HE WILL REGRET IT 
BUT I'M SURE ON REFLECTION THE WORD 
BORING NOT WHAT HE MEANT I'M 
SURE HE MEANT THAT IT'LL BE A HECK 
OF A CHALLENGE TO GET NEWCASTLE 
UNITED FROM WHERE THEY ARE NOW TO 
BE ONE OF THE TOP FOUR L. DON'T 
THINK IT IS ANYONE'S DEFINITION OF 
BORING BUT IT IS HIS CHALLENGE AND 
I KNOW IT IS EMOTIONAL AND HE WILL 
TAKE IT ON WITH GREAT VIGOUR ANDY ANDY MURRAY HAS LOST IN STRAIGHT SETS TO 
STANISLAV WAWRINKA IN THE SECOND 
ROUND OF THE MASTERS 
THE SCOT STRUGGLED AGAIN ON THE 
CLAY WAWRINKA WILL MEET JUAN 
CARLOS FERRERO WHO PUT OUT RAFAEL

THE FORTY EIGHT YEAR OLD MUNSTER MAN 
SUCCEEDS EDDIE O'SULLIVAN WHO 
RESIGNED IN MARCH HE WON'T TAKE 
CHARGE UNTIL IRELAND'S SUMMER TOUR 
IN NEW ZEALAND AND AUSTRALIA 
AS YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE PLAYING 
BEHIND US WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 
PARALYMPIC WORLD CUP BUT WE ARE 
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES AND PARALYMPICS IF 
YOU THINK ABOUT THE OLYMPIC 
MOVEMENT WE ALL KNOWS THAT BRITAIN 
DO PARTICULARLY WELL IN ROWING THE 
LIKES OF MATTHEW PINSENT AND STEVE 
REDGRAVE IN PARALYMPIC ROWING IT 
IS NO DIFFERENT IT IS THE FIRST 
TIME IT'LL TAKE PART IN THE 
PARALYMPIC GAMES AND WE HAVE HIGH 
HOPES 
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT BEING IN 
THE BRITISH ROWING TEAM WINNING IS 
EVERYTHING AND SECOND PLACE IS 
NOWHERE NOWHERE AND AS THEY PREPARE FOR THEIR FIRST 
PARALYMPIC GAMES GOLD MEDALS ARE 
VERY MUCH ON THE AGENDA 
THIS IS TOMING A A. R. HE HAS BEEN 
ROWING FOR JUST UNDER TWO YEARS 
TOM AGGAR HE HAS BEEN ROWING FOR 
JUST UNDER TWO YEARS AFTER 
SUSTAINING A SPINAL INJURY HE IS 
ALREADY ONE OF THE WORLD'S BEST L. 
HAVE SEEN YOU ALL THE BOYS AND 
GIRLS WHIZZING UP AND DOWN THE 
WATER THE BOATS LOOK ROUGHLY THE 
SAME BUT HOW DOES IT WORK FOR YOU 
THE MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS 
BOAT AND A CONVENTIONAL FINE ROWING 
ABOUT IS THE SHELL ITSELF A 
SLIGHTLY WIDER WE STRAP OURSELVES 
IN WE USE AN OUTRIG OF FLOATS 
WHICH HELPS WITH STABILITY ALL THE 
STROKING IS COMING FROM YOUR UPPER 
BODY YOUR ARMS AND SHOULDER BLADE 
SHOW ME ROUGHLY A STROKE 
AS YOU 
COME FORWARD YOUR BODY BREAKS 
AGAINST THE STRAP YOU LOCK ON IN 
THIS POSITION AND PULL THROUGH UP 
TO YOUR CHEST ALL THE ROWING 
ACTION IS GENERATED FROM YOUR UPPER 
BODY AND ARMS 
AND DON'T WORRY YOU DON'T NEED 
SHOULDERS THE SIZE OF A HOUSE TO BE 
AT THE STOP HELENE RAYNSFORD A 
FORMER G. B. BASKETBALL PLAYER IS 
ANOTHER CHAMPION 
AS HELENE 
RAYNSFORD SKULLS UP TO THE LINE 
LOOK AT THE DISTANCE SHE IS FOR 
THE FIRST TIME THE WORLD CHAMPION 
WHAT SLEE LACKS IN INCHES SHE 
MAKES UP FOR IN TECHNIQUE AND 
DETERMINATION 
I'M MOCKED FOR DETERMINATION HAVING THE SHORTEST ARMS IN THE 
ROWING WORLD BUT I SUPPOSE IT IS A 
CASE OF STRENGTH AND APPLICATION 
THE OTHER THING THAT'S SUGGESTED IS 
BECAUSE YOU ARE UNABLE TO USE YOUR 
LEGS AND JUST YOUR UPPER BODY YOU 
MIGHT BE WORKING HARDER THAN THOSE 
LAZY TYKES LIKE PINSENT AND 
REDGRAVE 
YES I WOULD THINK SOME REDGRAVE OF THEM WOULD BE DETERRED FROM 
GOING OUT IN A BOAT AND USING ARMS 
ONLY PERHAPS WE WILL CHALLENGE 
THEM IN AN ARMS ONLY BOAT 
LOOK OUT FOR THOSE TWO GUYS DURING 
THE PAR LICHIC GAMES DON'T FORGET 
OF COURSE B. B. C. TWO THE PARALYMPIC 
GAMES AND B. B. C. TWO HAVE COVERAGE OF 
THE PARALYMPIC WORLD CUP THESE ARE 
THE BUDDING STARS THEY WANT ME TO 
JOIN IN BUT YOU WILL TREAT ME 
GENTLY NO 
DID THEY SAY NO GENTLY NO I HOPE HE HAS SHIN PADS ON 
THINK BACK WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER 
ABOUT TWELVE WHAT DID YOU WANT TO BE 
WHEN YOU GREW UP I'M ASKING YOU 
I WANTED TO BE FILM DIRECTOR DID YOU YOU YES SWEET OR ROCKSTAR OR BALLET 
DANCER PERHAPS NOT OR A PILOT 
WELL FOR ANYONE WHO DREAMED ABOUT 
BECOMING AN ASTRONAUT ALL MIGHT 
NOT BE LOST THE EUROPEAN SPACE 
AGENCY IS CURRENTLY RECRUELTYING 
ASTRONAUTS ANYONE CAN APPLY DOCTOR 
TRACEY DICKENS HAS SPENT HER LIFE 
WAITING FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY OFF 
DIARY ENTRY AGED TWELVE TO PROVE IT 
WHAT DOES IT SAY 
IT SAYS IN THE 
DIARY THAT I'M GOING TO BE AN 
ASTROPHYSICIST SLASH US A TRO NOUGHT YOU YOU ARE AN ASTROPHYSICIST 
I AM NOW NOW YOU CAN'T TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT I I AM 
HOW DOES IT WORK THE AM THE APPLICATION COMES OUT ON NINETEENTH MAY 
THE FIRST THING FOR THAT IS YOU 
HAVE TO PROVE YOUR IDENTITY AND YOU 
HAVE HAD TO HAVE PASSED A FLIGHT TWO 
MEDICAL YOU GET A PASSWORD WHICH 
TAKES YOU TO THE APPLICATION 
PROCESS IT IS LIKE APPLYING FOR A 
JOB YOU FILL IN THE FORM AND IT 
GOES THROUGH AND YOU SIT BACK AND 
WAIT FOR THE NEXT ROUND 
WHAT ARE 
THE JOB REQUIREMENTS 
BASIC JOB 
REQUIREMENTS ARE A SCIENCE DEGREE 
NOW WHEN YOU SAY A SCIENCE DEGREE 
MOST PEOPLE ASSUME IT IS PHYSICS OR 
ASTRONOMY IT IS NOT NECESSARILY 
TRUE YOU NEED GEOPHYSICIST AND 
GEOLOGISTS YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE 
PHYSICISTS SO THE SCIENCE CAREER 
BACKGROUND IS GOOD SOME PILOTING 
EXPERIENCE IS NECESSARY IT IS NOT 
A MUST BUT IT IS NECESSARY A LOT 
OF PEOPLE ASSUME YOU NEED TO BE 
FLUENT IN RUSSIAN BUT IT IS THE 
SECOND LANGUAGE OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION IT IS 
NOT A MUST 
DO YOU HAVE ANY RUSSIAN 
YOURSELF 
I'M A BEGINNER SLASH ADVANCED YOURSELF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET UP THERE I I DO I HAVE RESEARCHED IT FOR A LONG 
TIME 
WHY WHAT WAS THE APPEAL TIME THERE IS SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME IT 
HAS BEEN A FASCINATION SINCE I WAS 
TWELVE I REMEMBER WATCHING THE FILM 
SPACE CAMP AND I WENT INTO MY LOCAL 
LIBRARY IN PETERBOROUGH AND CAME 
ACROSS THE NEWSROUND BOOK OF SPACE 
AND IN THAT WAS AN ARTICLE FOR 
SPACE CAMP L. WAS AMAZED WOW THIS 
CAMP EXISTS IT IS NOT JUST FILM 
HEADED OVER TO THE STATES AND IT 
HAS CARRIED ON 
THERE IS A LITTLE 
CATCH BECAUSE BRITAIN DOESN'T 
ACTUALLY PAY A WHOLE LOT INTO THE 
EUROPEAN SPACE PROGRAMME DOESN'T 
THAT WEIGH AGAINST ANY BRITISH 
APPLICANTS 
I THINK THE AIM OF THIS APPLICANTS ROUND IS THE FACT THEY HAVE OPENED 
IT UP TO THE E. S. A. MEMBER STATES IT 
IS A CHANCE FOR ALL THE COUNTRIES 
TO SHOW THE BEST OF THE BEST AND TO 
SHOW THAT THEIR CITIZENS ARE JUST 
AS CAPABLE AS ANYONE ELSE AND 
HOPEFULLY THROUGH THAT E. S. A. WILL 
TURN AROUND TO THE BRITISH 
GOVERNMENT AND SAY WE HAVE 
INCREDIBLY QUALIFIED PEOPLE FROM 
YOUR COUNTRY YOU NEVER KNOW ALL 
FOUR CANDIDATES CHOSEN TO BE 
BRITONS SO THEN TO GET TO THE 
GOVERNMENT AND SAY LOOK YOU 
REALLY NEED TO BE BACKING THIS YOU 
HAVE SOME FANTASTIC CITIZENS OF 
YOUR COUNTRY THAT CAN DO YOUR 
COUNTRY PROUD 
YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT 
IT YOU ARE LEARNING RUSSIAN YOU 
WANTED TO DO IT SINCE YOU WERE TWELVE 
WHAT ARE THE OTHER THINGS YOU CAN 
DO TO PUT YOURSELF AT THE FRONT OF 
THE QUEUE 
THE OTHER THINGS ARE 
SCUBA DIVING IT OBVIOUSLY 
SIMULATES WEIGHTLESSNESS IN SPACE 
MUCH IT IS A GOOD QUALITY TO HAVE 
AND YOU WOULD BE THE SECOND BRITISH 
WOMAN I WOULD YES BUT 
I WOMAN HAVE NUMEROUS OTHER TITLES I HAVE 
COME UP WITH THERE COULD BE THE 
FIRST BRITISH PERSON ON THE MOON 
THE FIRST BRITISH FEMALE PERSON ON 
THE MOON OR THE FIRST PERSON ON THE 
MOON 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE FIRST MOON PERSON ON THE MOON 
SORRY NO 
FORGET THAT 
THERE WILL BE ANOTHER 
ONE 
FIRST BRITISH PERSON ON THE ONE MOON YEAH WE WILL GO WITH THAT 
LOVELY TO SEE YOU WE WILL SEE YOU

LIKE A BAT OUT OF HELL THE 
ROCK 'N ROLL LEGEND MEATLOAF WILL 
BE HERE FOR SOME CHAT OUT OF HELL 
IT IS SIX HUNDRED FORTY FIVE FIVE DAYS AFTER THE 
CYCLONE STRUCK BURMA THE TRUE 
SCALE OF THE DEVASTATION IS 
BECOMING CLEAR THE DEATH TOLL 
COULD REACH ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THE UNITED 
NATIONS CALLED ON BURMA'S MILITARY 
GOVERNMENT TO DROP VISA 
REQUIREMENTS LET'S SPEAK TO JOHN 
THAT HEAD WHO IS REPORTING FROM 
JONATHAN HEAD WHO IS REPORTING 
FROM BANGKOK 
HOW BIG BACKLOG IS THE AID 
AGENCIES TRYING TO GET IN 
IT IS 
CRITICAL THE AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE 
THE SIZE OF THE AREA THAT'S 
AFFECTED AND THE DEATH TOLL THAT'S 
RISING IS WAY BEYOND ANYTHING THAT 
EXISTS INSIDE BURMA THE UNITED 
NATIONS IS TRYING TO GET THE KIND 
OF AID FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD NO 
FOOD OR WATER FOR FIVE DAYS THEY 
HAVE NOTHING TO COOK WITH SOME 
HAVE NO HOMES WHAT THEY NEED IS IS 
EMERGENCY FOOD LIKE HIGH ENERGY 
BISCUITS THAT FOOD DOESN'T EXIST 
THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME WAS SAYING 
THREE PLANES LOADED WITH FORTY TONNES 
OF THOSE BISCUITS WAS STILL WAITING 
FOR PERMISSION TO LAND 
WE HAVE HAD AID COMING IN FROM 
COUNTRIES THAT BURMA CONSIDERS 
FRIENDLY MAINLY SYMBOLIC AID 
THINGS THAT MAY NOT BE USABLE FOR 
THE PEOPLE BUT THE CRITICAL 
INTERNATIONAL AID HAS NOT COME IN 
IN ANYTHING LIKE THE QUANTITIES IT 
IS NEEDED NOR ARE THE EXPERTS IN 
MANAGING A DISASTER LIKE THIS MOST 
OF THE INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES HAVE 
TEAM INS INSIDE BURMA BUT THEY ARE 
SMALL TERRIBLY OVERSTRETCHED AND 
NOT EXPERIENCE INDEED MANAGING A 
DISASTER ON THIS SCALE UP UNTIL 
NOW NOT ANY REALISATION AMONGST 
BURMA'S GENERALS OF HOW BIG A 
SITUATION THEY ARE DEALING WITH AND 
HOW MUCH HELP THEY NEED TO BRING IN 
JONATHAN HEAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH

SEE YOU LATER ON 
TIME TO CATCH UP WITH AARON 
GOOD MORNING SHE DOESN'T LOOK TOO 
BAD DOES SHE THE NEW INDIAN 
OWNERS OF JAGUAR HAVE SOMETHING TO 
CHEER ABOUT THIS MORNING BECAUSE 
THE BRITISH LUXURY CAR MAKER MOVED 
UP TO FIFTH POSITION IN A TABLE OF 
MOST SATISFIED CUSTOMERS JAGUAR 
BEAT ITS GERMAN RIVALS BETTER SED 
YESES AND MERCEDES AND B. M. W. AND WE 
SENT BRIAN MILLIGAN AND TOLD HIM TO 
HIT THE ROAD 
SIMON IS SO KEEN ON JAGUARS THAT HE 
COLLECTED HIS FIFTH ONE FROM THE 
LOCAL SHOW ROOM 
WHERE ONCE HE HAD SOME DOUBTS ABOUT 
THE BUILD QUALITY AND RELYABILITY 
OF JAGUARS NOW HE IS A SATISFIED 
CUSTOMER CUSTOMER I THINK THE LOOK THE FEEL AND THE 
QUALITY OF THE BUILD IS GOOD I'VE 
HAD NO COMPLAINTS OR ANY PROBLEMS 
AT ALL WITH THE CAR OVER THE LAST 
TWO YEARS 
SO JAGUAR IS MOTORING UP THE 
SATISFACTION INDEX BUT IT IS 
BEHIND LEXUS SKODA AND TOYOTA AND 
HONDA HONDA AMONG THE LEAST SATISFYING CARS 
ARE ARE THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THEY 
BREAKDOWN MORE IT COULD BE FOR 
EXAMPLE THAT THEIR DIANA PRINCESS 
OF WALES DEALERSHIPS OFFER POOR 
SERVICE SERVICE IT IS THE WAY THE DEALERS REACT AND 
DEALERS ARE MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO PLEASE CUSTOMERS AND TO GET 
CUSTOMERS BACK IF THEY LOOK AFTER 
THEM IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG 
LITTLE APPEARS TO BE GOING FOR 
JAGUAR NOT ONLY IS THE COMPANY 
WINNING GREATER CUSTOMER 
SATISFACTION IT ANNOUNCED THAT 
SALES HAVE RISEN BY EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OVER THE 
LAST YEAR IN BRITAIN CREDIT CRUNCH 
OR NOT 
THE FOOTSY CLOSED UP FORTY FIVE POINTS 
THE F. T. S. E. CLOSED UP FOUR POINTS 
I WILL BE BACK LATER TO TALK ABOUT 
THE CARPHONE WAREHOUSE THE MOBILE 
PHONE MOBILE PHONE GUYAN AND THIS 
POSSIBLE GUYAN AND THIS POSSIBLE 
ONE BILLION TIE TIE UP WITH BEST BUY 
NOW WOULD YOU ALLOW YOUR TEN YEAR 
OLD TO WALK UNSUPERVISED TO THE 
SHOPS MOST YEARS AGO MANY PARENTS 
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN WORRIED 
MORE THAN HALF OF US WON'T LET OUR 
CHILDREN OUT ALONE 
HAVE NEIGHBOURHOODS REALLY CHANGE 
THAT HAD MUCH ARE WE MORE SCARED 
OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN 
DAVID DAVID DAVID SILLITO REPORTS 
THIS IS THE LOLLY TEST 
ARE YOU ALLOWED TO WALK TO YOUR 
LOCAL SHOP ON YOUR OWN 
ARE YOU PLAYING OUT TOMORROW YEAH YEAH WELL THE ANSWER FOR THIS LITTLE 
GROUP OF TEN AND ELEVEN YEAR OLDS 
WAS FOR THE MOST PART NO 
MY MUM AND DAD DON'T WANT ME GOING 
OUT ON MY OWN 
I HAVE TO GO WITH A FRIEND BECAUSE 
MY MUM IS PROTECTIVE OF ME 
YOU CAN'T GO ON YOUR 
OWN YET NO NO YOU CAN'T GO TO THE SHOP ON YOUR OWN YET NO NO THE AGE OF FREE RANGE CHILDREN IS 
OVER JOE'S MUM MUM FELT THE 
FREEDOM SHE HAD WAS IMPOSSIBLE 
DO YOU THINK IT IS BAD THAT HE HAS 
NEVER BEEN TO THE SHOP ON HIS OWN 
HE HAS BEEN WITH HIS FRIEND AND 
WITH HIS BROTHER L. WOULDN'T TRUST 
HIM IT IS NOT THAT I DON'T TRUST 
HIM IT IS OTHER PEOPLE THAT I 
DON'T TRUST 
HE WOULDN'T GET INTO TROUBLE OF OF COURSE HE WILL 
IT IS NOT SAFE ANYMORE FOR OUR 
CHILDREN CHILDREN WHERE ARE WE GOING TO FIND HIM 
JOSEPH JOSEPH IT IS NOT JUST JILL AND JOE REALLY 
ABOUT WELL SIX OUT OF TEN PARENTS 
BELIEVE IT IS NOT SAFE FOR A TEN 
YEAR OLD TO GO TO THE SHOPS ON 
THEIR OWN 
ONE HUNDRED YARDS IS AS FAR AS 
SHE IS ALLOWED TO GO 
DEFINITELY 
WOULDN'T ALLOW HER TO GO ANY 
FURTHER I HATE THAT BECAUSE I 
USED TO LOVE GOING OUT AND I FEEL 
THEY MISS OUT 
HAS ANYTHING EVER HAPPENED 
NO NOT 
AS AS YET IT IS THE NOT KNOWING 
ISN'T IT 
DOES IT MATTER 
RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN USING WRIST 
BANKS TO MONITOR HOW CHILDREN MOVE 
AROUND CHESHUNT AND THEY NOTICE A 
BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN THEY ARE 
ALLOWED OUT ON THEIR OWN 
WE ARE 
WALKING SENSIBLY 
WHEN THEY ARE OUT ON ON THEIR SEM 
HEIFERS THEMSELVES THEY ARE 
TALKING AND MORE LIVELY 
FIFTEEN MINUTES FOLLOWING ELLIE AND 
SOPHIE PROVED THE POINT THEY 
EXPLORED AND RAN ABOUT MORE THAN 
WHEN THEY WERE WITH ADULTS 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE NOT 
ALLOWED OUT THAT THAT MUCH 
HOWEVER JAMES DID PASS THE LOLLY 
TEST BUT HIS MUM IS STILL WORRIED 
I THINK IT IS A NICE NEIGHBOURHOOD 
I HAVE HAD NO TROUBLE WITH IT BUT 
IN THE BACK OF MY MIND THERE IS 
SOMETHING THERE 
FROM WHERE WHAT THE THE TELEVISION TELEVISION AND IT IS THE SORT OF PLACE THAT 
PEOPLE MOVE TO BRING UP CHILDREN TO 
GIVE THEM SPACE BUT ALLOWING THEM 
OUT INTO IT IS A DIFFERENT MATTER 
THAT'S ENOUGH EXERCISE FOR ME FOR 
ONE ONE YOU THINK YOU HAD IT IT BAD I 
LIVED IN A HOLE IN THE ROAD 
HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU STARTED 
WALKING TO SCHOOL 
I I CYCLED TO MY FRIEND'S WHO LIVED 
A MILE AWAY WHEN I WAS EIGHT 
I USED TO WALK TO PRIMARY SCHOOL 
WOULD YOU DO THE SAME WITH YOUR OWN 
CHILDREN OR DO YOU FEEL IT IS JUST 
TOO DANGEROUS ANYMORE LET US KNOW

FRIDGE A FEW DAYS OR WEEKS LATER 
YOU THINK YOU NEVER GOT AROUND TO 
EATING IT AND CHUCK IT IN THE BIN 
HOW MUCH DO WE THROW AWAY 
YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED IT IS NOT 
JUST THE COSTS GOING UP SO IT 
SEEMS IS THE AMOUNT WE THROW AWAY 
TEN BILLION EACH YEAR ACCORDING TO 
WRAP THE GOVERNMENT FUNDED WASTE 
AND RESOURCES ACTION PROGRAMME 
RESEARCHERS LITERALLY WENT THROUGH 
PEOPLE'S BINS TO DISCOVER NOT JUST 
THE VOLUME OF FOOD THROWN AWAY BUT 
ALSO THE DIFFERENT TYPES SO FOR 
EXAMPLE UNOPENED Y. G. YOGHURT POTS 
IT IS THOUGHT THIRTEEN MILLION ARE 
THROWN INTO BINS EVERY DAY 
FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WHOLE CHICKENS NEVER MAKE IT 
OUT OF THE PACKAGING AND INTO THE 
OVEN OVEN AND IT MIGHT BE CONVENIENT BUT IT 
IS THOUGHT FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND READY MEALS EACH 
DAY END UP UNUSED UNEATEN AND IN 
THE BIN 
I THINK MOST PEOPLE WILL BE VERY 
SHOCKED THE FIGURES ARE 
ASTONISHING AND I THINK PEOPLE WILL 
THEN WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
AND THAT WILL BE THINGS LIKE 
PLANNING MORE CAREFULLY LOOKING 
MORE AT THE STORAGE INFORMATION AND 
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THEY STORE FOOD 
CORRECTLY AND THEN MAKING SURE 
THEY USE IT BEFORE IT GOES OUT OF 
DATE DATE BUT AS EMETE KNOWS IT IS EASIER 
SAID THAN DONE A BUSY MUM SHE 
FINDS HERSELF THROWING FOOD AWAY 
EVERY WEEK 
WHEN YOU GO TO A 
SUPERMARKET YOU GO FOR A PINT OF 
MILK AND BREAD IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO 
COME BACK WITH THOSE TWO THINGS 
YOU THINK I WILL BUY SOME APPLES 
OR THE FRESH CREAM CAKE BECAUSE IT 
IS THERE AND PRESENTED SO WELL ON 
THE SHELVES 
WELL THEY ARE EXTRAORDINARY FIGURES 
AREN'T THEY HOW ARE THEY REACHED 
WRAP THE ORGANISATION THAT 
CONDUCTED THE RESEARCH SAY THEY 
LOOKED AT THE BINS OF AROUND TWO THOUSAND 
PEOPLE IN ENGLAND AND WALES AND 
HAVE EXTRAPOLATED THE FIGURES TO 
GIVE A VIEW TO THE WHOLE OF THE U. K. 
IT IS NOT SPECIFIC BUT MANY PEOPLE 
INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF THE 
ENVIRONMENT THINK IT IS A FIR 
ASSESSMENT OF THE A FOOD BEING 
THROWN AWAY OF FOR A FAMILY WITH 
CHILDREN IT LOOKS AROUND SIX HUNDRED EACH 
YEAR OF FOOD IS ENDING UP IN THE 
BIN THIS IS THE KITCHEN OF THE 
WELCH FAMILY THEY ARE PRETTY GOOD 
AT NOT THROWING TOO MUCH AWAY WE 
WILL BE GETTING TOP TIPS FROM THEM 
IN A FEW MINUTES' TIME WONDER 
HOW MANY PEOPLE THERE ARE IN THAT 
FAMILY WHEN WE FIRST WENT THERE 
ARE ONLY A COUPLE NOW THEY ARE ALL 
COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST 
IN OTHER NEWS A B. B. C. INVESTIGATION 
HAS REVEALED FOREIGN CRIMINALS 
COULD BE WORKING IN RESTRICTED 
ZONES IN BRITAIN'S AIRPORTS BECAUSE 
OF A LOOPHOLE IN VETTING RULES FOR 
THE PAST FIVE YEARS ALL STAFF IN 
HIGH SECURITY AREAS HAVE HAD U. K. 
CRIMINAL RECORD CHECKS OFFENCES 
COMMITTED ABROAD THOUGH ARE NOT 
COVERED IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF 
THE GOVERNMENT'S PLAN IT KEEP AIR 
PASSENGERS SAFE IF YOU HAVE 
CRIMINAL RECORD YOU CAN'T WORK 
AIRSIDE IT'S A. R. SIMPLE RULE WITH 
WORRYING LOOPHOLE IT IS A SIMPLE 
RULE FOREIGN WORKERS ARE NOT 
SUBJECT TO THE SAME CONTROLS AS 
THOSE FROM THE U. K. ANY OFFENCES 
COMMITTED ABROAD WON'T SHOW UP IN 
CURRENT CRIMINAL RECORDS CHECK THE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS IT WOULD TAKE TOO 
LONG AND BE TOO COMPLEX TO CHECK 
CRIMINAL RECORDS OVERSEAS NOW 
THERE ARE CALLS FOR URGENT CHANGE 
THEY SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CARRY OUT 
SECURITY CHECKS ON ALL PEOPLE 
CURRENTLY WORKING AIRSIDE ANYBODY 
WHO FAILS SHOULD BE REMOVED AND 
BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE IS EMPLOYED 
THOSE SECURITY CHECKS SHOULD BE 
COMPLETED THEY SHOULD DO THAT 
IRRESPECTIVE OF COST AND AS FAST AS 
CAN BE DONE OTHERWISE IT IS WORSE 
THAN COMPLACENT IT IS RECKLESS 
AROUND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WORK AIRSIDE 
ACROSS AIRPORTS IN THE U. K. THE 
AIRPORT OPERATOR B. A. A. WON'T CONFIRM 
HOW MANY ARE FOREIGN NATIONALS BUT 
IT IS THOUGHT THE NUMBER RUNS INTO 
THOUSANDS THE GOVERNMENT DENIES 
ITS POLICY IS PUTTING PASSENGERS AT 
RISK 
THE ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE IN RISK PLACE WE BELIEVE ARE APPROPRIATE 
HOWEVER WE HAVE ASKED SIR STEPHEN 
BOYCE SMITH TO REVIEW THOSE 
ARRANGEMENTS AND IF WE NEED TO 
UPGRADE THEM WE WILL DO THAT I'M 
NOT SAYING EVERYTHING IS ABSOLUTELY 
PERFECT BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE 
FOOLISH OF ME 
BUT THERE ARE 
UNLIKELY TO BE ANY IMMEDIATE 
CHANGES TO THE WAY AIRPORT WORKERS 
WILL BE SCREENED THAT REVIEW WON'T 
BE COMPLETED UNTIL THE SUMMER 
A UNITED NATIONS RELIEF TEAM IS 
FINALLY DUE TO ARRIVE IN BURMA 
TODAY FIVE DAYS AFTER THE CYCLONE 
WHICH HAS KILLED TENS OF THOUSANDS 
OF PEOPLE UN OFFICIALS SAY 
AIRCRAFT LOADED WITH VITAL FOOD 
SUPPLIES FOR SURVIVORS ARE STILL 
WAITING FOR PERMISSION TO LAND THE 
TOP AMERICAN DIPLOMAT IN BURMA HAS 
WARNED THE FINAL DEATH TOLL COULD 
EXCEED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE A MAN HAS 
DIED AND TWO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TAKEN 
TO HOSPITAL AFTER A SUSPECTED GAS 
EXPLOSION ON A RESIDENTIAL STREET 
IN HARROW IN NORTH WEST LONDON THE 
EXPLOSION HAPPENED LAST NIGHT AND 
DESTROYED TWO HOUSES ABOUT FORTY 
PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED FROM THEIR 
HOMES EMERGENCY SERVICES SPENT 
HOURS SEARCHING THE RUBBLE AND AN 
INVESTIGATION HAS BEGUN INTO WHAT 
CAUSED THE BLAST 
AMY WINEHOUSE HAS BEEN RELEASED ON 
BAIL AFTER BEING QUESTIONED BY 
POLICE ABOUT ALLEGED DRUG OFFENCES 
THE SINGER VOLUNTARILY ATTENDED AN 
EAST LONDON POLICE STATION SHE WAS 
ARRESTED OVER FOOTAGE WHICH 
APPEARED IN JANUARY WHICH APPEARED 
TO SHOW HER SMOKING CRACK COCAINE 
PRINCES WILLIAM AND HARKPWRI 
ATTENDED AN OPEN AIR TRIBUTE LAST 
NIGHT IN LONDON NEAR SAINT PAUL'S FOR 
A CEREMONY OF MUSIC AND SPEECHES 
AND MARCHES MONEY RAISED WILL GO 
TOWARDS REHABILITATION FOR INJURED 
MILITARY PERSONNEL AROUND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
CHILDREN IN BRITAIN BETWEEN THE 
AGES OF FIVE AND SEVEN REGULARLY 
SURF THE WEB WITHOUT ANY ADULT 
SUPERVISION ACCORDING TO NEW 
RESEARCH TODAY CEOP THE CHILD 
EXEMPLOY STATION AND ONLINE 
PROTECTION CENTRE IS LAUNCHING A 
SCHEME TO TEACH YOUNG CHILDREN HOW 
TO STAY SAFE ONLINE 
AROUND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ONE IN ONE HUNDRED CHILDREN IN 
ENGLAND ARE SPACTED BY AUTISM BUT 
THERE ARE NO FIGURES ON HOW MANY 
ADULTS HAVE THE CONDITION THE 
GOVERNMENT WILL NOW PAY FOR 
RESEARCH PETER GRIFFIN IS TWENTY EIGHT BUT 
HE HAS NEVER LEFT HOME HE CAN'T 
PETER HAS ASPERGER SYNDROME A FORM 
OF AUTISM HE HAS A DEGREE IN 
ASTROPHYSICS BUT HIS HIGH INTELLECT 
CAN MASK SERIOUS DISABILITIES AT AT THE MOMENT I'M NOT REALLY COMPETENT 
ENOUGH IN CERTAIN AREAS LIKE 
COOKING FOR EXAMPLE AND MONEY 
MANAGEMENT TO BE ABLE TO LIVE 
INDEPENDENTLY THE BIG PROBLEM IS 
THAT I HAVE A RATHER ERRATIC SLEEP 
PATTERN AS WELL 
RESEARCH SUGGESTS 
ONE IN ONE HUNDRED CHILDREN HAS AUTEDISM 
BUT UNTIL NOW THERE HAS BEEN 
AUTISM BUT UNTIL NOW THERE HAS 
BEEN NO EQUIVALENT STUDY OF ADULTS 
WHEN WE THINK OF AUTISM WE OFTEN 
THINK OF CHILDREN BUT IT IS A LIFE 
LONG DISABLE WITH NO CURE YET 
PARTLY BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE 
GROWN UP UNDIAGNOSED WE JUST DON'T 
KNOW HOW MANY ADULTS WITH AUTISM 
THERE ARE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS 
CALCULATING HOW MANY ADULTS THERE 
ARE SIMILAR IT PETER IS KEY TO 
GETTING THEM THE RIGHT SUPPORT TO 
LEAD FULL LIVES 
A RECRUITMENT CAMPAIGN IS BEING 
LAUNCHED ACROSS BRITAIN TODAY TO 
TRY TO FIND NEW ASTRONAUTS THE 
EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY IS OFFERING 
PEOPLE THE CHANCE TO TAKE PART IN 
MISSIONS TO THE MOON AND TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AND WE 
ARE SPEAKING TO ONE HOPEFUL LATER 
THERE'S CONCERN THAT BRITISH 
HOPEFULS WILL BE AT A DISADVANTAGE 
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT ISN'T 
PROVIDING FUNDING TO THE HUMAN 
SPACE PROGRAMME 
CHINESE MOUNTAINEERS HAVE TAKEN AN 
OLYMPIC TORCH TO THE TOP OF MOUBT 
EVEREST THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES BEGIN A PREVIOUS 
ATTEMPT FAILED BECAUSE OF STRONG 
WINDS AND SNOW STORMS ONE 
MOUNTAINEER SAID IT WAS A GESTURE 
OF PEACE AND HARMONY IT IS A 
DIFFERENT TORCH FROM THE ONE 
INVOLVED IN THE PROTESTS IN LONDON 
AND PARIS SOMEHOW THEY KEPT IT 
ALIVE ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP WE 
ARE ASKING YOU HOW YOU THINK THEY 
MANAGED TO DO IT WE HAVEN'T AN 
ANSWER YET WE WONDER APPROXIMATE 
IF IT IS AN EVER LASTING FLAME WE 
DIDN'T THINK THEY COULD GET AWAY 
WITH THAT PAPER FLUTTERY THING 
THOSE ARE THE TOP STORIES COMING 
UP WE WILL BRING YOU AN 
EXTRAORDINARY TALE OF FOUR FAMILY 
MEMBERS ALL HEADING OUT TO SERVE IN 
IRAQ LOTS OF HAVE YOU WRITTEN IN 
WITH YOUR STORIES FIRST HOW MUCH 
FOOD DO YOU THROW AWAY UNTOUCHED 
AND UNEATEN ACCORDING TO NEW 
RESEARCH THEY ARE THROWING AWAY TEN 
BILLION OF EDIBLE FOOD EVERY YEAR 
HOW CAN WE CUT DOWN ON OUR WASTE 
TIM MUFFET JOINS US ANY MORE 
MEMBERS OF FAMILY COMING DOWN TO 
BREAKFAST 
NOT YET WE ARE BREAKFAST EXPECTING MORE A LITTLE LATER AS AS WE HEARD EXTRAORDINARY FIGURES AN 
AVERAGE FAMILY WITH CHILDREN WASTES 
AROUND SIX HUNDRED A YEAR ON FOOD MUCH IS 
PERFECTLY FINE IT ENDS UP IN THE 
BIN THE WELCH FAMILY ARE GOOD AT 
NOT THROWING TOO MUCH AWAYED A AM 
IF I COULD FIRST ASK YOU HOW DO 
YOU DO IT HOW DO YOU AVOID 
THROWING AWAY TOO MUCH OF YOUR 
FOOD 
I THINK THE FIRST TRIGER IS FOOD NOT TO BUY TOO MUCH IN THE FIRST 
PLACE WE BUY FRESH FOOD FOR THREE 
TO MAYBE FOUR DAYS AND THEN 
ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE LEFT OVER WE 
TRY AND USE IN THE NEXT MEAL SO 
SHEPHERD'S PIES SPAGHETTI 
BOLOGNESE THAT IS A GOOD ONE FOR 
US 
BERNADETTE WHEN YOU GO US SHOPPING HOW DO YOU AVOID THE 
TEMPTATIONS WHICH WE ALL HAVE TO 
CONTEND WITH 
WELL SHOPPING FOR A 
FAMILIAR LIVE SIX IT IS VERY 
TEMPTING BUT IF I BUY TOO MUCH THEN 
I FREEZE IT IN FACT IF YOU WANT TO 
HAVE A LOOK IN THE FREEZER LET'S LET'S CHECK OUT THE FRIDGE AND FREEZER 
IT IS VERY ORDERED 
I ALWAYS KNOW 
WHAT IS IN THERE AND I TRY ROTATE 
IT THERE IS ALWAYS LOTS OF TWO FOR 
ONE OFFERS SO FOR A FAMILY OF SIX 
IT CERTAINLY KEEPS THE BILLS DOWN 
BUT MINCEMEAT IS GREAT YOU CAN PUT 
THAT INTO LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS 
AND I HAVE SOME CUBED BEEF THERE 
WHICH I CAN MAKE A CASEROLE AND 
FREEZE THE REST IF I DON'T GET 
AROUND TO USING IT I CAN FREEZE IT 
IMPRESSIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
LET'S TALK TO JANEY LEE GRACE YOU 
HAVE WRITTEN EXTENSIVELY ON FOOD 
AND RELATED SUBJECTS WHERE ARE WE 
GOING WRONG ARE SUPERMARKETS 
PARTLY TO BLAME 
I THINK THEY VERY 
MUCH ARE TO BLAME WITH LOTS OF THIS 
IT IS A BIGGER ISSUE AS WELL AS 
THROWING AWAY FOOD WE THROW AWAY 
COPOUS AMOUNTS OF PACKAGING IT IS 
ANOTHER SUBJECT FOR ANOTHER TIME 
ONE OPTION IS TO JUST GET STUFF 
DELIVERED A VEG TAL BOX DELIVERY 
SCHEME YOU WILL GET STUFF IN 
SEASON A VEGETABLE BOX IN WAR 
TIME WE KNOW PEOPLE WERE HEALTHIER 
THEY ATE LESS BUT ATE SEASONALLY 
GETTING STUFF DELIVERED IS GOOD A 
LOT OF PEOPLE ORDER ONLINE THAT 
REMOVES THE TEMPTATION IF YOU WALK 
AROUND A SUPERMARKET AND NEVER GO 
WHEN YOU ARE HUNGRY OR BEFORE LUNCH 
YOU WILL BE TEMPTED TO BUY 
EVERYTHING YOU SEE THESE THINGS 
AND THERE IS A FABULOUS BOGOF OR 
BUY ONE AND GET TWO FREE REALLY L. 
COULD USE THAT IT IS NOT REALLY 
FREE IF YOU THROW IT AWAY IT COSTS 
YOU MORE 
BOGOF BUY ONE GET ONE 
FREE FREE YOU WEREN'T BEING RUDE 
DO YOU THINK THAT'S THE ANSWER IN 
TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT KEEPING 
FOOD AND REUSING IT 
I THINK IT IS 
GOING OLD STYLE THINK OLD 
FASHIONED GROW YOUR OWN STUFF GO 
TO A FARMER'S MARKET GET STUFF 
DELIVERED MAKE FRESH MEALS COOK 
MORE THAN YOU NEED AND FREEZE ONE 
THEN YOU HAVE YOUR OWN READY MEAL 
IN THE OLDEN DAYS WE WOULD MAKE 
JAMS WE CAN CERTAINLY MAKE SOUPS 
AND CASEROLES IF YOU HAVE A 
JUICEER AND BERNADETTE WAS SAYING 
SHE MIGHT HAVE ONE STASHED AWAY L. 
WILL CONVINCE HER TO USE UP MUCH 
MORE FRESH FRUIT AND VEG AND HAVE 
JUICES 
I THINK I HAVE BEEN JUICES INSPIRED MY WIFE IT HAS TO BE SAID 
IS GOOD AT KEEPING FOOD AND USING 
IT FOR A LATER DATE IT IS A HUGE 
AMOUNT OF MONEY TEN BILLION A YEAR 
IT SEEMS WE ARE COLLECTIVELY 
THROWING AWAY INTO THE BIN PEOPLE 
HOPING WE CAN CUT DOWN ON THAT MUM 
IS HAVING A NICE CUDDLE THERE 
ISN'T SHE 
DION SAYS PEOPLE HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW 
TO USE THEIR SENSES TO CHECK IF 
SOMETHING IS O. K. TO EAT HE SAYS 
SNIFFS TOUCHES AND TASTES IT 
RATHER THAN STICKS TO THE SELL BUY 
DATES THE OLDER YOU GET THE LONGER 
YOU WILL EAT STUFF

LEADING ON THE AUSTRIAN CELLAR 
STORY SUN HAS THE LAST PICTURE OF 
ELISABETH FRITZL BEFORE SHE WAS 
LOCKED IN A DUNGEON AND A QUOTE IN

KILLER I COULD HAVE KILLED THEM 
AND NOBODY WOULD HAVE KNOWN A LOT 
IN THE PAPERS ABOUT THE WEATHER IT 
HAS BEEN LOVELY AND WILL CONTINUE 
CAROL WITH WITH US TO TELL US ABOUT 
THAT 
I HAVE NO TROUBLE WITH IT O. K. BUT 
IN THE BACK OF MY MIND THERE IS 
SOMETHING THERE 
HOW FREE IS YOUR CHILD WE WILL ASK 
WHY WE ARE TOO AFRAID TO LET OUR 
CHILDREN PLAY BEYOND OUR OWN FRONT 
DOORS DOORS SPARE A A THOUGHT FOR WEND WENDY 
MACKNESS WHY BECAUSE HER HUSBAND 
AND THREE SONS ARE ABOUT TO BE SENT 
TO IRAQ 
I NOTICED YESTERDAY THAT CAROL ADD 
ADD NEW WORD BUT WE HAD SCORCHIO 
YESTERDAY SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT 
GLARIOUS GLARIOUS AS SIAN WAS SAYING IT IS GOING TO 
BE LOVELY AND WARM 
TEMPERATURES PEAKED AT TWENTY FIVE CELSIUS 
TODAY WE COULD SQUEEZE OUT A TWENTY SIX 
CELSIUS WHICH IS SEVENTY NINE FAHRENHEIT THE 
WEATHER IS BREAKING DOWN 
TEMPORARILY FOR ONE PART OF THE 
COUNTRY TODAY AND THAT'S THE SOUTH 
WEST OF ENGLAND YOU CAN SEE THAT 
CLOUD MARCHING IN LATER IT WILL 
BRING SHOWERY RAIN WITH IT THE 
SOUTH EAST THIS MORNING A GLORIOUS 
START SOME LOVELY SUNSHINE ANY 
MIST YOU COME ACROSS WILL DISPERSE 
THE SAME TOO ACROSS THE NORTH OF 
ENGLAND ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THE 
COAST FROM THE NORTH OF YORKSHIRE 
HEADING UP INTO EASTERN SCOTLAND 
YOU COULD SEE LOW CLOUD INITIALLY 
BUT THAT TOO WILL THIN AND BREAK 
FOR SCOTLAND THE REST OF NORTHERN 
ENGLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND AGAIN 
LOVELY BLUE SKIES 
THE ISLE OF MAN AND ANGLESEY AND 
WALES IT IS A SIMILAR STORY 
SUNSHINE TO START WITH NOT COLD FOURTEEN 
CELSIUS IN CARDIFF AND FOURTEEN CELSIUS 
IN PLYMOUTH ALTHOUGH THE WEATHER 
WILL CHANGE IN THE SOUTH WEST TODAY 
TO START WITH IT IS GOING TO BE 
VERY NICE 
SOMETHING ELSE YOU WILL NOTICE 
QUITE A BREEZE IN THE SOUTH MORE 
SO THAN YESTERDAY THAT MIGHT TAKE 
THE EDGE OF THE TEMPERATURES BUT 
THE EAST COAST IT WILL BE COOLER 
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE FAR 
INLAND UNTIL THE TEMPERATURES 
RESPOND TO THE SUNSHINE BUT AS YOU 
CAN SEE COMING INTO THE SOUTH WEST 
WE HAVE THE SHOWERY RAIN BAN 
THROUGH THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON 
AND INTO THE EVENING AHEAD OF THE 
RAIN BAN THERE WILL BE CLOUD 
SPREADING ACROSS PARTS OF THE SOUTH 
COAST THE RAIN MOVING IN AS WELL 
PERHAPS AS FAR EAST AS READING AND 
TOMORROW AFFECTING THE SOUTH EAST 
AND WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND 
STILL AHEAD OF IT MORE CLOUD THAN 
WE HAVE BEEN USED TO IT IS THE 
EAST THAT'S HANGING ON TO THE BEST 
OF THE WEATHER 
AS WE PUSH INTO SATURDAY CENTRAL 
AND EASTERN AREAS ENJOYING A FINE 
DAY STILL LOTS OF SUNSHINE ON 
OFFER BUT SOME RAIN AFFECTING 
SCOTLAND AND SOME SHOWERS INTO

WELCOME TO MANCHESTER FOR THE 
PARALYMPIC WORLD CUP IT INVOLVES 
FOUR SPORTS CYCLING SWIMMING 
ATHLETES AND BASKETBALL THESE 
GUYS AND GIRLS ARE BUDING ATHLETES 
THEY WON DAY WANT TO DREAM OF 
GETTING TO THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OLYMPIC GAMES

PRESENT STARS BUILDING UP TO 
BEIJING LATER BUT FIRST ROUND UP 
OF THE SPORTS THAT TOOK PLACE LOOST

GOAL WAS SCORED LAST NIGHT BY BARRY 
FERGUSON CHASING TOTAL OF FOUR 
TROPHIES THEY STILL FACE ANOTHER 
FOUR LEAGUE GAMES AND TWO CUP 
FINALS IN THE NEXT SEVENTEEN DAYS SCOT 
LAND MANAGER GEORGE BURLEY IS ON 
THEIR SIDE AND CRITICISED THE SPL'S 
REFUSAL TO EXTEND THE DOMESTIC 
SEASON AS RIDICULOUS ELSEWHERE 
B. B. C. SPORT HAS LEARNED THAT SVEN 
GORAN ERIKSSON HAS HAD TALKS IN 
MANCHESTER WITH THE PORTUGESE CLUB 
BENFICA ERIKSSON'S POSITION AT 
MANCHESTER CITY IS UNCERTAIN 
ALTHOUGH THE OWNER THAKSIN 
SHINAWTRA SAYS A DECISION WILL BE 
TAKEN AT THE ENOF THE SEASON IF 
ERIKSSON RETURNS TO THE LISBON CLUB 
IT WILL BE HIS THIRD SPELL THERE 
AWAY FROM FOOTBALL AND TO TENNIS 
AND BRITISH NUMBER ONE ANDY MURRAY 
LOST IN STRAIGHT SETS TO STANISLAV 
WAWRINKA IN THE ROAM MASTERS 
THE TWENTY YEAR OLD AGAIN STRUGGLE IN 
THE PLAY WAWRINKA WILL MEET JUAN 
CARLOS FERRERO WHO PUT OUT RAFAEL 
NADAL WASPS LOOK CERTAIN TO MAKE 
IT THE TO THE PLAY OFFS IN THE 
GUINNESS PRIP 
AND DECLAN KIDNEY HAS BEEN 
APPOINTED AS IRELAND'S NEW COACH 
SUCCEEDS EDDIE O'SULLIVAN WHO 
RESIGNED IN MARCH HE WON'T TAKE 
CHARGE UNTIL AFTER IRELAND'S SUMMER 
TOUR IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND 
WHY ARE WE HERE WE ARE LOOKING 
FORWARD TO THE PARALYMPICS AND THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES THE COUNTDOWN NOW 
REALLY STARTS TO BEIJING AND WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT PARALYMPICS WHEN WE 
THINK ABOUT THE OLYMPIC GAMES WE 
THINK PROBABLY OF THE ROWERS SO 
MUCH SUCCESS WE HAVE A SIMILAR 
THING IN PARALYMPICS IT IS THE 
FIRST TIME IT'LL EVER TAKE PLACE 
THERE AND BRITAIN HAS VERY HIGH 
HOPES 
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT BEING IN 
THE BRITISH ROWING TEAM WINNING IS 
EVERYTHING AND SECOND PLACE IS 
NOWHERE AS THEY PREPARE FOR THEIR 
FIRST PARALYMPIC GAMES GOLD MEDALS 
ARE VERY MUCH ON THE AGENDA 
THIS IS TOM AGGAR HE HAS BEEN 
ROWING FOR JUST UNDER TWO YEARS 
AFTER SUSTAINING A SPINAL INJURY 
HE IS ALREADY ONE OF THE WORLD'S 
BEST HAVE JUST SEEN YOU ALL THE 
BOYS AND GIRLS WHIZZING UP AND DOWN 
THE WATER THE BOATS LOOK ROUGHLY 
THE SAME BUR HOW DOES IT WORK FOR 
NEW THIS PARTICULAR BOAT BUT HOW 
DOES IT WORK FOR YOU IN THIS 
PARTICULAR BOAT 
THE MAIN 
DIFFERENCE TO THIS AND A 
CONINVESTIGATIONAL ROWING BOAT IS 
THE SHELL IS WIDER WE STRAP 
OURSELVES IN WE USE A OUTRIG OF 
FLOATS WHICH HELPS WITH STABILITY 
ALL THE STRENGTH COMES FROM YOUR 
UPPER BODY YOUR ARMS AND SHOULDER 
BLADES 
HOW DOES IT WORK SHOW ME BLADES ROUGHLY A STROKE 
AS YOU COME 
FORWARD YOUR BODY IS BRACED AGAINST 
THE STRAP YOU LOCK ON IN THIS 
POSITION AND PULL THROUGH BACK UP 
TO YOUR CHEST SO ALL THE ROWING 
ACTION IS GENERATED FROM YOUR UPPER 
BODY AND ARMS 
AND DON'T WORRY YOU 
DON'T NEED SHOULDERS THE SIZE OF A 
HOUSE TO BE AT THE TOP HELENE 
RAYNSFORD A FORMER G. B. BASKETBALL 
PLAYER PLAYER IS ANOTHER ATHLETE 
HELENE RAYNSFORD IS THE WORLD 
CHAMPION 
WHAT 
SHE LACKS IN INCHES CHAMPION SHE MAKES UP IN TECHNIQUE AND DETERMINATION 
I'M MOCKED FOR DETERMINATION HAVING THE SHORTEST ARMS IN THE 
ROWING WORLD IT IS A QUESTION OF 
STRENGTH AND DETERMINATION THE THE OTHER THING THAT WAS SUGGESTED IS 
YOU MIGHT BE WORKING HARDER THAN 
THOSE LAZY TYKES LIKE PINSENT AND 
REDGRAVE REDGRAVE YEAH I SUPPOSE I THINK SOME OF 
THEM WOULD PROBABLY BE RATHER PURR 
TUSHED BY THE FACT OF GOING OUT 
INTO A BOAT AND ROWING ARMS ONLY 
PERTURBED MAYBE AFTER THE OLYMPICS 
WE WILL GET THEM TO DO CHALLENGE 
AND RACING US IN AN ARMS ONLY BOAT 
O. K. WE ARE BACK AND AS YOU CAN SEE 
THEY ARE VERY DETERMINED OUT ON THE 
WATER AND THEY ARE PRETTY 
DETERMINED OUT HERE THEY ARE 
MAKING A LOT OF NOISE BUT I WANT TO 
INTRODUCE YOU TO THE PLAY MAKER 
THAT'S HOW YOU HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED 
OF THE MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM TERRY 
YOUNG BUDDING ATHLETES HOW 
IMPORTANT IS THE PARALYMPIC WORLD 
CUP FOR NEW PREPARATIONS FOR 
BEIJING 
IT IS MASSIVE IT BEIJING SIMULATES WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN 
BEIJING THE WAY IT IS RUN SO 
PROFESSIONALLY AND SMOOTHLY IT IS 
FANTASTIC THE KIDS CAN COME AND SEE 
US TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING THE THE MEN GOT A BRONZE IN ATHENS WHERE 
ARE WE IN THE WORLD NOW WE WE FINISHED SECOND IN THE EUROPEAN 
CHAMPIONSHIPS UNFORTUNATELY LOSING 
TO SWIEN SWEDEN L. WOULD SAY WE ARE 
IN THE TOP FIVE IN THE WORLD SO SO THERE OR THEREABOUTS IN THE OLYMPIC 
HOPE OFS FOR MEDALS WHAT NEEDS TO 
CHANGE TO MAKE IT GO YOUR WAY IT IT IS HARD TO SAY THERE ARE MAYBE 
EIGHT TEAMS THAT COULD POSSIBLY WIN 
A MED A WHEELCHAIR BASKETBALL IS 
GETTING STRONGER AND STRONGER WE 
HAVE CANADIANS AMERICA OURSELVES 
GERMANY SWEDEN ANYONE COULD 
SURPRISE IT IS JUST PREPARATION 
YOU HAVE THE YOUNG KIDS BEHIND 
TAKING PART BUT WE NEED MORE AND 
MORE TO GET OUT THERE AND HAVE A 
GO 
THAT'S WHY THE PARALYMPIC WORLD GO CUP IS FANTASTIC YOU ARE PLAYING 
IN FRONT OF YOUR HOME CROWD G. B. 
DON'T PLAY A LOT OF HOME GAMES 
ALTHOUGH HOME SO THE KIDS CAN'T 
TRAVEL AROUND TO WATCH YOU PLAYING 
ABROAD SO THAT'S WHY IT IS GOOD TO 
GET THEM HERE IN MANCHESTER AND TO 
SEE WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT 
GOOD LUCK 
THIS AFTERNOON L. THINK YOU HAVE A 
COUPLE OF GAMES WE WILL KEEP HOLD 
AND TRY AND CONTROL SOME OF THESE 
YOUNGSTERS ANOTHER YOUNGSTER 
MAYBE IN HIS MID THIRTIES WILL HAVE A GO 
A BIT LATER ON 
YOU STILL LOOK YOUNG CHRIS ENJOY 
IT IT NOW WOULD YOU ALLOW YOUR TEN YEAR 
OLD TO WALK UNSUPERVISED TO THE 
LOCAL SHOPS TWENTY YEARS AGO MOST OF 
US WOULDN'T HAVE WORRIED NOT IT 
SEEMS ANY MORE A WHICH HAD RANGING 
NEW SURVEY FOR BEREFT HAVE 
DISCOVERED MOTHER THAN HALF OF YOU 
WON'T LET YOUR CHILDREN OUT BY 
YOURSELVES WE ARE ASKING HAVE 
NEIGHBOURHOODS CHANGED THAT MUCH OR 
ARE WE MORE SCARED OF WHAT MIGHT 
HAPPEN DAVID SILLITO HAS BEEN TO 
CHESHUNT IN HERTFORDSHIRE TO TRY TO 
FIND OUT 
THIS IS THE LOLLY TEST ARE YOU 
ALLOWED TO WALK TO YOUR LOCAL SHOP 
ON YOUR OWN 
ARE YOU PLAYING OUT 
TOMORROW 
WELL THE ANSWER FOR THIS TOMORROW LITTLE GROUP OF TEN AND ELEVEN YEAR 
OLDS WAS FOR THE MOST PART NO 
MY MUM AND DAD DON'T WANT ME GOING 
OUT ON MY OWN 
I HAVE TO GO ON MY 
FRIEND BECAUSE MY MUM IS QUITE 
PROTECTIVE 
YOU CAN'T GO ON YOUR PROTECTIVE OWN YET NO 
YOU CAN'T GO TO THE NO SHOP ON YOUR OWN YET NO 
THE AGE NO OF FREE RANGE CHILDREN IS IT 
SEEMS OVER JO'S MUM JILL FELT THE 
FREEDOM SHE HAD HAD WAS NOW 
IMPOSSIBLE DO YOU THINK IT IS BAD 
HE HAS NEVER BEEN TO THE SHOP ON 
HIS OWN 
HE HAS WITH A FRIEND AND 
BROTHER L. DO FEEL IT IS BAD BUT I 
WOULDN'T TRUST HIM WELL IT IS NOT 
HIM I DON'T TRUST IT IS OTHER 
PEOPLE 
HE WON'T GET INTO TROUBLE PEOPLE WILL HE 
OF COURSE HE WILL OF 
COURSE HE WILL IT IS JUST NOT SAFE 
ANY MORE FOR OUR CHILDREN 
ARE YOU 
SURE 
YES I'M SURE I'M VERY SURE SURE WHERE ARE WE GOING TO FIND HIM HE 
IS GOING TO BE HERE JOSEPH 
IT IS JOSEPH NOT JUST JILL AND JOE REALLY ABOUT 
WELL SIX OUT OF TEN PARENTS 
BELIEVE IT IS NO LONGER SAFE FOR A 
TEN YEAR OLD TO GO TO THE SHOPS ON 
THEIR OWN ONE HUNDRED YARDS IS AS FAR AS 
SHE'S ALLOWED TO GO 
ON HER OWN 
DEFINITELY L. WOULDN'T ALLOW HER TO 
GO ANY FURTHER L. KNOW AND I HATE 
THAT L. USED TO LOVE GOING OUT L. 
FEEL THEY MISS OUT 
HAS ANYTHING 
HAPPENED AROUND HERE 
NOT AS YET 
IT IS THE UNKNOWN 
SO DOES IT 
MATTER WELL RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN 
USING RISK BANDS LINKED TO 
SATELLITES TO MONITOR HOW CHILDREN 
MOVE AROUND CHESHUNT AND THEY HAVE 
NOTICED A BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN THEY 
ARE ALLOWED OUT ON THEIR OWN 
I AM 
NOW WORKING ON VERY SENSIBLY WHERE 
MY CHILDREN WALK ALONG THEY RUN 
AROUND LIKE THAT BUT WHEN THEY ARE 
OUT BY THEMSELVES THEY DO MUCH MORE 
EXPLORING AND TALKING TO EACH OTHER 
AND INTERACTING IN A LIVELY 
INTERESTING WAY 
FIFTEEN MINUTES 
FOLLOWING ELLIE AND SOPHIE PROVED 
THE POINT THEY MEANDERED MOOCHED 
EXPLORED AND RAN ABOUT MORE THAN 
WHEN THEY WERE WITH ADULTS 
I DON'T 
UNDERSTAND WHY LIKE US TWO AREN'T 
ALLOWED OUT THAT MUCH HOWEVER HOWEVER JAMES DID PASS THE LOLLY TEST BUT 
HIS MUM'S STILL WORRIED 
I THINK IT IS A VERY NICE 
NEIGHBOURHOOD TO BE PERFECTLY 
HONEST WITH YOU HAVE HAD NO 
TROUBLE WITH IT O. K. BUT IN THE 
BACK OF MY MIND THERE IS SOMETHING 
THERE 
FROM WHERE WHAT THE THERE THE TELEVISION TELEVISION AND IT IS THE SORT OF PLACE THAT 
PEOPLE MOVE TO TO BRING UP 
CHILDREN TO GIVE THEM SPACE 
BUT ALLOWING THEM OUT INTO IT IS A 
DIFFERENT MATTER 
SO INTERESTING ALISON BAVERSTOCK 
IS AUTHOR OF BOOK CALLED WHATEVER 
A GUIDE TO TEENAGERS SHE IS A 
MOTHER OF FOUR TWENTY DOWN TO TWELVE SO 
PASSED THE REALLY WORRYING AGE 
INTELU YOUR VIEW THAT CHILDREN ARE 
GENERALLY HAPPIER IF THEY ARE LET 
OUT ON THEIR OWN MORE IS IT YOUR 
VIEW 
WELL I THINK WE HAVE TO VIEW DEVELOP SKILLS AND CONFIDENCE IN 
CHILDREN SO THEY CAN BECOME 
INDEPENDENT ADULTS L. THINK IF WE 
ARE SO BUSY KEEPING THEM INDOORS 
AND FILLING THEM WITH FEAR ABOUT 
WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN THE STREET WE 
ARE NOT PREPARING THEM AS MUCH AS 
WE MIGHT 
WHOSE FAULT IS IT A LOT 
OF E. MAILERS ARE SAYING THAT 
ACTUALLY IT IS THE FAULT OF THE 
MEDIA FOR SUGGESTING THAT THERE IS 
MORE CRIME OUT THERE THAN THERE 
REALLY IS 
WELL NEWS IS THINGS THAT 
DON'T HAPPEN ALL THE TIME L. THINK 
IT IS OUR RESPONSE TO THE MEDIA 
THEY ARE REPORTING THINGS THAT ARE 
UNUSUAL A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 
FRIGHTENED AND FEEL THAT IT IS 
THE LADY SAID PEOPLE LURKING BEHIND 
BUSHES ALL THE TIME IF WE ARE 
BUILDING UP OUR CHILDREN TO BE 
FRIGHTENED IT IS NOT A GOOD START 
WHAT SPRINGS TO MY MIND IS THE CASE 
OF THE SOHAM MURDERS HOLLY AND 
JESSICA WANDERING AROUND QUIET 
VILLAGE ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND 
END UP BEING KILLED THAT'S THE 
FIRST THING SO MANY PEOPLE THINK OF 
THAT THEY DESPERATELY DON'T WANT TO 
HAPPEN TO THEIR CHILDREN 
IT IS 
ALWAYS DIFFICULT RE WRITING HISTORY 
BUT THERE IS THIS THINGS THAT 
PEOPLE WHO DO KILL CHILDREN ARE 
KNOWN THEY ARE NOT A STRANGER IN 
THAT CASE HE WAS THE SCHOOL 
CARETAKER SO IT IS NOT AN UNCOMMON 
SWAIFPLGTS I THINK WE CAN TALK 
THROUGH THINGS AND UNCOMMON 
SITUATION L. L. THINK WE CAN TALK 
THROUGH THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN SOAP 
OPERAS AND IN THE PRESS BUT PREPARE 
THEM AND NOT FRIGHTEN THEM THESE 
DAYS CHILDREN ARE IN THE BACK OF 
THE CAR HAVE NEVER BEEN IN PUBLIC 
TRANSPORT THEY DON'T HAVE THE 
FEELING THAT THINGS AREN'T QUITE 
RIGHT THE FLIGHT OR FRIGHT 
MECHANISM CHILDREN NEED TO 
EXPERIENCE THAT TO RECOGNISE TRUE 
DANGER WHEN IT CROPS UP 
HOW DO YOU 
DO THAT 
YOU DO IT A BIT AT A TIME 
YOU GIVE THEM A LITTLE BIT OF 
FREEDOM AT A TIME IN THE CASE OF 
WALKING TO THE BUS STOP OR WALKING 
TO THE SHOP TO GET A PINT OF MILK 
YOU LET THEM GO IN PAIRS OR YOU 
MANAGE IT 
YOUR CHILDREN ALL WALKED TO SCHOOL 
FROM YEAR SIX 
THEY STARTED DOING 
IT IN YEAR FIVE BUT IT WAS 
NEGOTIATED IF I FELT THEY WERE 
DOING IT SENSIBLY THEY HAD TO DO 
IT IN PAIRS AND IF I FELT THE 
SITUATIONS WITH BEING RESPECTED 
LIKE THEY CAME STRAIGHT BACK AFTER 
SCHOOL AND THEY DIDN'T DAUDLE AND 
WE AGREED WHAT TIME THEY WOULD BE 
BACK WE DISCUSSED WATCHES AND THIS 
SORT OF THING L. THINK IF YOU GIVE 
THEM A BIT OF FREEDOM YOU ARE 
ENTITLED TO GIVE THEM A BIT MORE 
ONE VIEWER SAYS HER DAUGHTER IS 
EIGHT AND SHE PLAYS OUT AND SHE 
DOES WORRY AND YOU HAVE TO TEACH 
TEACH THEM ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY AND 
FREEDOM FREEDOM THEY DON'T HAVE THE LIFE EXPERIENCE 
TO DEAL WITH IT THERE IS NO GOOD 
SAYING YOU SHOULD OF KNOWN OR GROW 
UP A BIT BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN 
ADULTS AND IT SEEMS TO ME 
SIGNIFICANT THERE IS AN OPTION FOR 
GAP YEAR CHILDREN THERE ARE PEOPLE 
RUNNING COURSES ON HOW TO BE STREET 
WISE BEFORE YOU GO ON YOUR GAP YEAR 
IT IS LATE BY THEN IF YOU HAVEN'T 
DEVELOPED ANY STREET WISE SKILLS IN 
TERMS OF HOW TO USE YOUR MOBILE 
PHONE IN PUBLIC WHETHER TO GET 
YOUR MONEY OUT HOW TO AVOID DIM 
STREETS THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE 
SHOULD BE FEEDING THEM WORTHWHILE 
THE CORNFLAKES NOT GIVING THEM A 
CRASH COURSE WHEN THEY ARE EIGHTEEN 
THANK YOU 
THIS IS BREAKFAST 
THE AVERAGE BRITISH FAMILY THROWS 
AWAY OVER SIX HUNDRED WORTH OF PERFECTLY 
EDIBLE FOOD YEAR THE GOVERNMENT 
SAYS THE FIGURES ARE SHOCKING 
A B. B. C. INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT 
FOREIGNERS CAN GET JOBS IN HIGH 
SECURITY AREAS AT BRITISH AIRPORTS 
BECAUSE OF A LOOPHOLE IN VETTING 
LAWS M. 
HE WILL DO ANYTHING FOR LOVE BUT 
WHAT WILL HE DO FOR SIAN 
HE WON'T DO THAT 
MEATLOAF WILL BE JOINING US LIVE 
HOWEVER HARD YOU ASK HIM WHAT IS 
THAT THAT NOW THE WEATHER 
IT IS A FABULOUS START WE HAVE 
SUNSHINE CHILLY ACROSS PARTS OF 
SCOTLAND SCOTLAND FOR MOST OF THE BRITISH ISLES WE 
WILL HAVE MORE PLEASANT WARM 
SUNSHINE TO ENJOY A BREAKDOWN COME 
NOTHING THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND 
LATER ON TODAY IN THE SHAPE OF 
CLOUD AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE 
SATELLITE PICTURE AND THAT WILL BE 
FOLLOWED BY SHOWERY RAIN FOR THE 
SOUTH EAST ANOTHER CRACKING START 
WITH LOT 
OF SUNSHINE AROUND MORE OF A BREEZE ACROSS SOUTHERN AREAS 
QUITE A BREEZE TOO COMING IN OFF 
THE NORTH SEA BUT INLAND AGAIN 
FOR MUCH OF ENGLAND IT IS A LOVELY 
START FOR THE BULK OF SCOTLAND 
NORTHERN IRELAND AND WALES WE ARE 
LOOKING AT A FINE AND SUNNY START 
TO THE DAY NOT PARTICULARLY COLD 
AND FOR MOST JUST A LIGHT EASTERLY 
BREEZE IT IS THE SOUTH THAT IS 
GOING TO SEE THE STIFFER BREEZE 
INITIALLY FIRST THING THIS MORNING 
WE ARE LOOKING AT A BRIGHT START IN 
THE SOUTH WEST BUT THAT WILL WILL 
CHANGE THROUGH THE DAY AS MORE 
CLOUD STARTS TO BUILD IN AND THE 
CLOUD CLOUD WILL TRAVEL ALONG PARTS 
OF THE SOUTH COAST OF ENGLAND IT 
IS THE SOUTH WEST THAT WILL SEE IT 
IT FRESHEN AND THE WIND PUSH IN 
LATER ON 
THE POLLEN INDEX IS ALSO HIGH TODAY 
AND IT IS BIRCH POLLEN WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT 
TONIGHT THE RAIN BAND AND THE 
CLOUD MOVE FURTHER EASTWARDS 
THAT'S WHERE IT WILL BE TOMORROW 
BUT THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND 
WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND DAMP 
CENTRAL AREAS MORE CLOUDMENT IT IS 
THE EAST AGAIN THAT HANGS ON TO THE 
SUNSHINE FOR THE LONGEST PERIOD OF 
TIME CENTRAL AND EASTERN AREAS ON 
SATURDAY GETTING AWAY WITH ANOTHER 
FINE WARM AND SUNNY DAY THE WEST 
SEEING MORE CLOUD AND SOME RAIN TOO

SHOWERS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
LOOK AT THE TEMPERATURES TWENTY FOUR CELSIUS 
THAT'S GOOD 
THAT'S THE FORECAST 
TIME TO DIAL AARON AT THE CARPHONE 
WAREHOUSE WAREHOUSE I LIKE THAT 
LET'S CONTINUE ON THIS BIG DEAL 
CARPHONE WAREHOUSE SELLING FIFTY PER CENT 
STAKE OF ITS RETAIL BUSINESS TO THE 
U. S. GIANT BEST BUY THE VALUE ONE POINT ONE 
BILLION BILLION IT IS WHOOPER OF 
A DEAL 
RICHARD PERKS JOINS US RICHARD 
ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU 
THERE SEEMS TO BE TWO BIG REASONS 
THAT CARPHONE WAREHOUSE IS DOING 
THIS ONE OF TRYING TO BUY THE U. K. 
OPERATIONS OF TISCALI BUT TALKING 
ABOUT BUYING THE GIANT RETAIL 
COMPANIES 
ON THE CARPHONE COMPANIES WAREHOUSE HAS BIG STORES IT NEEDS 
MORE PRODUCTS AND BEST BUY IS GOOD 
AT SELLING HI TECH BOYS TOYS WHICH 
HAVE DONE BADLY EVERYWHERE ELSE IN 
THE U. K. 
INTERESTING TIME DOING IT 
CONSIDERING NOT ONLY THE ECONOMIC 
SLOWDOWN BUT THE ELECTRICAL 
RETAILERS AND MANY OUT THERE ARE 
SUFFERING THEY ARE HAVING TO OFFER 
BIG DISCOUNTS TO CLEAR THEIR STOCK 
NOW CARPHONE WAREHOUSE IS SAYING 
IT WANTS TO BE AS BIG IN EUROPE AS 
BEST BUY IS IN THE U. S. 
TO DO THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE 
AN ACQUISITION ANYONE GOING INTO 
THIS HAS TO LOOK LOOK BEYOND THE 
TOWN TURN AND WHERE WE GO NEXT L. 
THINK THERE IS AN TUNE WHAT IS OUT 
OPPORTUNITY WHAT IS OUT THERE IN 
THE U. K. IS BORING 
YOU THINK THEY WILL STRUGGLE IN 
EUROPE 
THERE ARE STRONG PLAYERS IN EUROPE EUROPE MEDIA MART TREMENDOUS 
BUSINESSES THE COMPETITION IS 
STRONGER OVER THERE THAN HERE 
WHAT DOES BEST BUY GET OUT OF THIS 
IT WANTS TO GET INTO EUROPE AND

YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE ANYTHING BUT 
LOVE BUT WHAT WILL MEAT LOAF DO 
FOR SIAN 
WE WERE SAYING EARLIER 
HE WON'T DO THAT 
FIVE ZERO CHICKENS 
ARE CHUCKED OUT BY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CHICKENS 
ARE THROW AWAY EVERY DAY OUR 
REPORTER HAS BEEN AT A BREAKFAST 
TABLE IN WINCHESTER GOOD MORNING 
MORNING TO YOU WE HAVE ALL DONE IT 
YOU GO TO THE SUPERMARKET GO 
SHOPPING BRING YOUR GROCERIES BACK 
PUT NEM THE FRIDGE COME BACK A FEW 
DAYS LATER AND SAY I NEVER GOT 
AROUND TO EATING THAT YOU CHUCK 
IT IN THE BIN COLLECTIVELY HOW 
MUCH DO WE THROW AWAY YOU WILL BE 
SURPRISED SURPRISED IT IS NOT JUST THE COST OF FOOD 
THAT IS GOING UP SO IT SEEMS IS 
THE AMOUNT WE SIMPLY THROW AWAY 
TEN BILLION YEAR EACH ACCORDING TO 
WRAP THE WASTE AND AMP RESOURCES ACTION 
PROGRAMME RESEARCHERS WENT THROUGH 
PEOPLE'S BINS NOT JUST TO DISCOVER 
THE VOLUME OF FOOD BUT ALSO THE 
DIFFERENT TYPES FOR EXAMPLE 
UNOPENED YOGYURT POTS THIRTEEN MILLION 
OF THEM ARE THROWN INTO OUR BINS 
EVERY DAY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WHOLE CHICKENS 
NEVER MAKE IT OUT OF THEIR 
PACKAGING AND NEVER MAKE IT INTO 
THE OFEN AND IT INTO THE OVEN 
IT IS THOUGHT FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND RODEY MEALS 
EACH DAY END UP UNEATEN AND IN THE 
BIN 
I THINK MOST PEOPLE WILL BE BIN VERY SHOCKED THE FIGURES ARE 
ASTONISHING L. THINK THAT PEOPLE 
WILL THEN WANT TO DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT IT THAT WILL BE THINGS LIKE 
PLANNING MORE CAREFULLY LOOKING 
MORE AT THE STORAGE INFORMATION 
TRY ING TO MAKE SURE THEY STORE 
FOOD CORRECTLY THEN MAKING SURE 
THEY USE IT BEFORE IT GOES OUT OF 
DATE 
AS THIS WOMAN KNOWS THAT IS DATE EASIER SAID THAN DONE A BUSY MUM 
SHE FINDS HERSELF THROWING FOOD 
AWAY EVERY WEEK 
WHEN YOU GO TO A 
SUPERMARKET YOU GO IN FOR A PINT OF 
MILK AND BREAD IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO 
COME AWAY WITH THOSE TWO THINGS 
YOU THINK I WILL BUY THOSE APPLES 
THAT CREAM CAKE BECAUSE IT IS 
PRESENTED SO WELL ON THE SHELF 
THEY ARE EXTRAORDINARY FIGURES 
AREN'T THEY HOW WERE THEY ACTUALLY 
REACHED WELL WRAP THE 
ORGANISATION WHO PUT THIS REPORT 
TOGETHER SAID THEY LOOKED AT TWO THOUSAND 
BINS IN ENGLAND AND WALES AND THEY 
HAVE EXTRAPOLATED THOSE FIGURES TO 
INCLUDE THE U. K. MANY INCLUDING THE 
DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT 
THINK IT IS A FAIR REFLECTION TO 
THE FAIR AMOUNT OF FOOD WE THROW 
AWAY INTO OUR BINS LATER ON THIS 
MORNING FULL REPORT WILL BE 
PUBLISHED BY WRAP WHICH WILL GIVE 
DETAILS FOR A FAMILY WITH KIDS 
THEY THROW AROUND SIX HUNDRED WORTH OF 
FOOD EVERY YEAR THIS IS THE WELCH 
FAMILY WITH SOME VERY VERY WELL 
BEHAVED CHILDREN THEY ARE GOOD AT 
THROWING NOT TOO MUCH AWAY WE WILL 
GET SOME TIPS FROM THEM LATER 
A B. B. C. I VESTGATION HAS REVEALED 
FOREIGN CRIMINALS COULD BE WORKING 
IN RESTRICTED ZONES AT AIRPORTS 
BECAUSE OF GAP IN VETTING RULES 
OFFENCES COMMITTED ABROAD ARE NOT 
COVERED COVERED IT IS A FUNDAMENT PLAN TO KEEP AIR 
PASSENGERS SAFE IF YOU HAVE 
CRIMINAL WORKER YOU CANNOT WORK 
AIRSIDE IT IS A SIMPLE RULE W. 
WORRYING LOOP HOLE FOREIGN WORKERS 
ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME 
CONTROLS AS THOSE FROM THE U. K. ANY 
OFFENCES COMMITTED ABROAD WON'T 
SHOW UP IN A CURRENT CRIMINAL 
RECORDS CHECK THE GOVERNMENT SAYS 
IT WILL TAKE TOO LONG AND BE TOO 
COMPLEX TO CHECK CRIMINAL RECORDS 
OVERSEAS NOW THERE ARE CALLS FOR 
URGENT CHANGE 
THEY SHOULD 
IMMEDIATELY CARRY OUT CHECKS ON 
PEOPLE WORKING AIRSIDE ANYONE WHO 
FAILS SHOULD BE REMOVED BEFORE 
ANYONE ELSE IS EMPLOYED THOSE 
SECURITY CHECKS SHOULD BE COMPLETED 
THEY SHOULD DO THAT IRRESPECTIVE OF 
COST AND AS FAST AS CAN BE DONE 
OTHERWISE IT IS WORSE THAN 
COMPLACENT IT IS RECKLESS AROUND AROUND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WORK AIRSIDE AT 
AIRPORTS ACROSS THE U. K. THE AIRPORT 
OPERATOR B. A. A. WILL NOT CONFIRM HOW 
MANY ARE FOREIGN NATIONALS IT IS 
THOUGHT THE NUMBER RUNS INTO 
THOUSANDS THE GOVERNMENT DENIES 
ITS POLICY IS PUTTING PASSENGERS AT 
RISK 
THE ARRANGEMENTS WHICH ARE IN RISK PLACE WE BELIEVE ARE APPROPRIATE 
HOWEVER WE HAVE ASKED SIR STEVEN 
BOYCE SMITH TO REVIEW THOSE 
ARRANGEMENTS IF WE NODE TO UPGRADE 
THEM WE WILL DO THAT L. AM NOT 
SAYING THAT EVERYTHING IS 
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT THAT WOULD BE 
FOOLISH OF ME 
THERE ARE UNLIKELY 
TO BE ANY IMMEDIATE CHANGES TO THE 
WAY AIRPORT WORKERS ARE SCREENED 
THAT REVIEW WON'T BE COMPLETED 
UNTIL THE SUMMER 
TO BUR WHAT MA NOW A UNITED 
NATIONS RELIEF TEAM IS FINALLY DUE 
TO ARRIVE THERE THAT IS FIVE DAYS 
AFTER THE CYCLONE WHICH HAS KILLED 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IT IS 
REPORTED THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT HAS 
JUST GIVEN PERMISSION FOR AMERICAN 
AEROPLANES TO FLY AID INTO THE 
COUNTRY THE TOP U. S. DIPLOMAT IN 
BURMA HAS WARNED THE FINAL DEATH 
TOLL COULD EXCEED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 
FIREFIGHTERS ARE STILL WORKING 
THEIR WAY THROUGH RUBBLE AFTER A 
MAN DIED IN A SUSPECTED GAS 
EXPLOSION IN A RESIDENTIAL STREET 
IN HARROW IN NORTH WEST LONDON LAST 
NIGHT TWO PEOPLE WERE TAKEN TO 
HOSPITAL THE EXPLOSION DESTROYED 
TWO HOUSES FORTY PEOPLE WERE 
EVACUATED FROM THEIR HOMES AMY 
WINEHOUSE HAS BEEN RELEASED ON BAIL 
AFTER BEING QUESTIONED BY POLICE 
ABOUT ALLEGED DRUG OFFENCES THE 
SINGER VOLUNTARILY ATTENDED A 
POLICE STATION SHE WAS ARRESTED 
OVER FOOTAGE PUBLISHED IN JANUARY 
WHICH APPEARED TO SHOW HER SMOKING 
CRACK COCAINE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
CHILDREN IN BRITAIN BETWEEN FIVE TO SEVEN 
REGULARLY SURF THE WEB WITHOUT 
ADULT SUPERVISION TODAY CEOP IS 
LAUNCHING A SCHEME TO TEACH YOUNG 
CHILDREN HOW TO STAY SAFE ON LINE 
WE TEACH OUR CHILDREN TO CROSS THE 
ROADS SAFETY BUT WHEN THEY TAKE 
THEIR FIRST STEPS INTO CYBERSPACE 
THEY ARE OFTEN ON THEIR OWN NOW 
AFTER REQUESTS FROM TEACHERS WHO 
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT YOUNG CHILDREN 
SURFING THE WEB WITHOUT EDUCATION 
A NEW CAMPAIGN IS HELPING CHILDREN 
STAY SAFE ON LINE 
I THINK A LOT OF 
PARENTS ARE NOT AWARE OF WHAT 
CHILDREN DOING ON THE INTERNET IF 
IT COMES FROM SCHOOLS IT IS 
PROBABLY TAKEN MORE SERIOUSLY 
THERE ARE AROUND FOUR MILLION 
CHILDREN OF PRIMARY SCHOOL AGE IN 
THE U. K. OF THOSE AROUND FIFTY NINE PER CENT 
REGULARLY GO ON LINE AT HOME BUT 
WHEN THEY DO TWENTY ONE PER CENT THAT IS NEARLY 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN SURF THE NET 
UNSUPERVISED AT THE CENTRE OF THE 
NEW CAMPAIGN IS THE CARTOON 
CHARACTER HECTOR THE DOLPHIN HE 
AND HIS FRIENDS LEARN HOW TO SURF 
SAFELY THROUGH THE INTERNET OCEAN 
MAYBE IT IS NOT SUCH A GOOD 
IDEA 
WE DON'T WANT TO SCARE IDEA CHILDREN OF THIS AGE GROUP WHAT 
THEY ARE DOING ON LINE IS DIFFERENT 
WE HAVE TRIED TO TAKE A SOFTER 
APPROACH LOOK AT STRANGER DANGER 
MESSAGES LOOK AT THE INFORMATION 
THEY ARE CREATING ON LINE WE HAVE 
CREATED A CARTOON WHICH IDENTIFYS 
HOW CHILDREN FEEL ON THE ON LINE 
ENVIRONMENT MOST CHILDREN KNOW 
THEY SHOULD NOT TALK TO STRANGERS 
IN THE STREET NOT TALKING TO 
STRANGERS WHO COME INTO THEIR HOMES 
VIA THE INTERNET IS NOT SO OBVIOUS 
IT IS HOPED THAT HECTOR AND HIS 
FRIENDS CAN GET THAT MESSAGE ACROSS 
AROUND ONE IN ONE HUNDRED CHILDREN IN 
BRITAIN ARE AFFECTED BY AUTISM BUT 
THERE ARE NO FIGURES FOR THE NUMBER 
OF ADULT SUFFERERS NOW BECAUSE OF 
FEARS THEY ARE OFTEN ABANDONED BY 
SOCIAL SERVICES THE GOVERNMENT WILL 
PAY FOR A SEARCH TO FIND OUT 
EXACTLY HOW MANY ADULTS HAVE THE 
CONDITION PETER GRIFFIN IS TWENTY EIGHT NEXT 
WEEK HE HAS NEVER LEFT HOME HE 
CAN'T PETER HASS A PER GERS 
SYNDROME A FORM A AUTISM HE HAS A 
DEGREE INS A TRO PHYSICS BUT HIS 
HIGH INTELLECT CAN MASK SERIOUS 
DISABILITIES 
AT THE MOMENT I AM DISABILITIES JUST NOT COMPETENT ENOUGH IN 
CERTAIN AREAS LIKE COOKING FOR 
EXAMPLE AND MONEY MANAGEMENT TO 
BE ABLE TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY THE 
BIG PROBLEM IS THAT I HAVE A RATHER 
IRRAT TICK SLEEP PATTERN AS WELL 
RESEARCH SUGGESTS ONE IN ONE HUNDRED 
CHILDREN HAS AUTISM UNTIL NOW 
THERE HAS BEEN NO EQUIVALENT STUDY 
FOR ADULTS WHEN WE THINK OF AUTISM 
WE OFTEN THINK ONLY OF CHILDREN 
BUT IT IS LIFE LONG CONDITION 
WITH NO CURE PARTLY BECAUSE SO 
MANY POEM HAVE GROWN UP UNDIAGNOSED 
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY ADULTS WITH 
AUTISM THERE ARE 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS CALCULATING HOW 
MANY ADULTS THERE ARE SIMILAR TO 
PETER IS KEY TO GETTING THEM THE 
RIGHT SUPPORT TO LEAD FULL LIVES 
A RECRUITMENT CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN LAN 
PED ACROSS BRITAIN TO FIND NEW 
ASTRONAUTS THE EUROPEAN SPACE 
AGENCY IS ASKING PEOPLE THE CHANCE 
TO TAKE PART IN THE MOON AND TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION THERE 
IS CONCERN THAT BRITISH HOPEFULS 
WOULD BE AT A DISADVANTAGE 
CHINESE MOUNTAINEERS HAVE TAKEN AN 
OLYMPICOR TOO MUCH THE TOP OF MOUNT 
EVEREST THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES BEGIN A PREVIOUS 
ATTEMPT FAILED DESPITE THE 
ALTITUDE AND COLD THE TORCH STAYED 
IT WILL ALL THE WAY TO THE SUMMIT 
HOW DO YOU DO THAT 
WELL A BREAKFAST VIEWER CONTACTED 
US AFTER WE ASKED HOW IT MANAGED TO 
STAY ALIGHT SYDNEY GOT IN TORCH TO 
SAY IT IS IN TOUCH TO SAY THEY 
CREATED AN EVER LASTING FLAME AND 
THEY EVEN HAD THE FLAME UNDERWATER 
AT THE GREAT BARRIER REEF 
IN A FEW 
MINUTES WE WILL BRING YOU THE STORY 
OF FOUR FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WILL ALL 
SOON BE SERVING IN IRAQ A LOT OF 
SERVICE FAMILIES HAVE BEEN WATCHING 
THIS MORNING

UNTOUCHED AND UNEATEN WE HAVE 
HEARD WE ARE THROWING AWAY 
BILLIONS OF UNEATEN FOOD MUCH

ADVANCE L. KNOW WHAT I AM HAVING 
FOR THE NEXT FOUR DAYS AFTER THAT 
WE FALL BACK ON THE FREEZER OR 
STORE CUPBOARD UNLESS I GO 
SHOPPING FOR MORE FRESH STUFF TO 
TOP UP WHAT I HAVE GOT

ORDERLY THE TWO FOR ONE DEALS WE 
BUY THEM AND THINK DO WE END UP 
USING THEM ALL 
I DO AND TAKE GOOD 
ADVANTAGE OF IT YOU ARE SAVING FIFTY P. 
HERE OR ONE THERE IT MAKES A BIG

ENOUGH TO FREEZE A BIT WHATEVER IS 
LEFT OVER FOR ANOTHER MEAL THANK THANK YOU VERY IMPRESSIVE FRIDGE JANIE 
LEE GRACE AUTHOR I KNOW YOU HAVE 
WRITTEN ABOUT FOOD WHERE ARE WE 
GOING WRONG 
IT IS A DISPOSABLE 
SOCIETY WE TEND TO GO TO THE 
SUPERMARKET WE TEND TO FORGET THE 
SHOPPING LIST WHICH IS THE MOST 
IMPORTANT BIT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A 
MEAL PLAN AND WANDER AROUND THE 
SUPERMARKET THEY ENTICE YOU TO BUY 
ALL SORT OF BUY ONE GET ONE FREES 
AND ALL THAT YOU WILL BUY LOTS OF 
THINGS YOU DON'T NEED NEVER GO 
SHOPPING WHEN YOU ARE HUNGRY OR 
JUST BEFORE LUNCH OF COURSE THE 
BUY ONE GET ONE FREE ARE NOT CHEAP 
BECAUSE IF YOU THROW THEM AWAY 
THERE IS HUGE COST INVOLVED IT IS 
NOT YUST THE FOOD WE ARE 
INTRODUCING AWAY IT IS THE 
PACKAGING AS WELL HUGE AMOUNTS OF 
PACKAGING WASTE 
DOES THE FAULT LIE 
WITH THE SUPERMARKETS OR US THEY THEY COULD DO MORE THEY COULD DO MORE 
TO STOP ENTICING US TO BUY STUFF 
BUT THEN WE SHOULD TAKE 
RESPONSABILITY L. WOULD SAY 
WHEREVER YOU CAN GO TO A LOCAL 
FARM'S MARKET GET A BOX SCHEME 
GET STUFF DELIVERED IN WAR TIME 
PEOPLE GREW THEIR OWN VEG THEY 
WERE HEALTHIER THAN WE WERE THEY 
ATE LESS AT THE END OF THE DAY 
THEY HAD ONE SMALL BIN FOR A FAMILY 
OF SIX IT IS BECAUSE THERE WAS 
LESS PACKAGING AND LESS FOOD WASTE

CALLIFIED IN EUROPE WHICH RANKS US 
THIRD 
WE CHATTED A LITTLE EARLIER THIRD WITH SOME OF THE MALE STARS WHO 
HAVE SOME SUCCESS AND HISTORY ARE 
THE WOMEN CATCHING UP RAPIDLY I I WOULD LIKE TO THINK SO AS I SAID 
WE GOT A BRONZE IN EUROPE LAST YEAR 
WHICH QUALIFIED US FOR BEIJING WE 
ARE HOPING TO IMPRESS AND IMPROVE 
OUR WORLD RANKING IN BEIJING OF OF COURSE TO DO THAT YOU NEED 
STRENGTH AND DEPTH ARE THERE 
ANOTHER YOUNGSTERS COMING THROUGH 
WE HAVE STRENGTH AND DEPTH AT THE 
MOMENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE 
ENOUGH YOUNG WOMEN COMING THROUGH 
IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE FEW MORE 
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO ANYONE 
THINKING OF HAVING A GAME GET GET INVOLVED NOW DON'T WAIT IF YOU 
WANT TO BE THE BEST IN TWO THOUSAND TEN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
START NOW 
IS THERE ANY ROOM FOR A 
THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD HAS BEEN 
I HOPE NOT 
THAT WAS ME LYING ABOUT EVEN BEING 
THIRTY FIVE SIAN AND BILL BACK TO YOU 
LATER ON WE WILL SPEAK TO NATALIE 
DU TOIT WHO HAS QUALIFIED NOT ONLY 
FOR THE PARALYMPIC GAMES BUT THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES AS WELL AN AMAZING 
STORY IMAGINE FILLING YOUR 
SUPERMARKET TROLLEY WITH FOOD AND 
THROWING ONE THIRD STRAIGHT IN THE 
BIN WHEN YOU GET HOME BUT 
ACCORDING TO NEW RESEARCH IT IS 
PRETTY MUCH WHAT WE DO EVERY WEEK 
MOST OF US DON'T EAT ONE THIRD OF 
THE FOOD WE BUY ZOE HERON AND 
ROSIE SYKES HAVE COLLABORATED ON 
BOOK ON HOW TO SAVE FOOD TIME AND 
MONEY IN THE KITCHEN THEY ARE HERE 
GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR COMING 
IN IT IS ASTONISHING ONE THIRD OF 
THE FOOD WE BUY WELY TO AWAY WHAT 
HAPPENED TO LEFTOVERS AND RE 
HEATING 
I THINK WE ONE THIRD OF HEATING THE FOOD WE BUY WE THROW AWAY L. 
THINK WE ARE BUSY WE DON'T HAVE 
TIME AND WE DON'T THINK ABOUT 
THINGS I THINK THERE IS A HUGE 
SKILLS GAP IN OUR GENERATION I 
THINK WE HAVE LOST THE BASIC SKILLS 
OF HOUSE KEEPING 
YOU AND ZOE HAVE 
COME UP WITH A SOLUTION HAVE YOU 
WHAT IS IT BASED ON 
IT IS BASED ON 
THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE ALWAYS 
LEFTOVERS AND LEFTOVERS SHOULDN'T 
BE SEEN AS SOMETHING BORING THEY 
ARE SOMETHING THAT COULD EASILY BE 
TURNED INTO SOMETHING ELSE EVEN 
THE SMALLEST THING COULD BE TURNED 
INTO SOMETHING LOVELY MASH POTATO 
WE HAVE A RECIPE FOR A PIZZA THAT 
HAS A POTATOBREAD BASE WITH ONIONS 
AND CHEESE 
YOU MIX THE POTATO WITH 
THE BREAD MIX 
WITH FLOUR ALMOST ALMOST LIKE A SCONE MIX AND SUDDENLY MASH 
POTATO BECOMES SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
YOU CAN SPEND FOUR OR FIVE ON A RED 
MADE PIZZA OR USE YOUR MASHED 
POTATO ROLL IT UP AND WHACK IT IN 
THE OVEN 
IN THE PAST MY FAMILY HAD 
A ROAST ON A SUNDAY AND YOU WOULD 
SEE THE MEAT AGAIN ON MONDAY AND 
IN SHEPHERDS BUY AND ON THE 
WEDNESDAY YOU WOULD HAVE LITTLE 
BITS WITH CHIPS WE USED TO MAKE 
FOOD LAST WE DON'T IS IT BECAUSE 
FOOD IS CHEAPER NOW WHY IS IT I I THINK IT IS PARTLY THAT WE HAVE 
WE HAVE GONE THROUGH A GREAT PERIOD 
OF PROSPERITY AND WE HAVE LOST THE 
WAR TIME AND POST WAR IDEA THAT 
EVERY SCRAP OF FOOD WAS IMPORTANT 
IT IS ALL ABOUT PLANNING AS WELL 
VERY FEW PEOPLE MAKE MEAL PLANS TO 
LAST A WEEK IN YOUR BOOK YOU HAVE 
DONE THAT HAVEN'T YOU SO IF I 
PICK IT UP YOU WOULD TELL ME WHAT 
I COULD EAT 
WE GIVE YOU PLANNERS 
SHOPS LISTS AND RECIPES FOR EVERY 
DAY OF THE YEAR YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
FOLLOW THE SYSTEM RELIGIOUSLY BUT 
YOU CAN DIP IN AND OUT AND MAKE IT 
YOUR OWN IT IS REALLY ABOUT TRYING 
TO TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO USE THEIR 
KITCHEN TO REDUCE TIME EFFORT AND 
IMPORTANTLY WHEN FOOD PRICES ARE 
GOING UP MONEY 
IF YOU THINK HOW 
MUCH WE THROW AWAY IMAGINE HOW 
MUCH THE SUPERMARKETS THROW AWAY A 
COUPLE OF PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN IN TO 
SAY THAT THERE IS MASSIVE OF STUFF 
THAT GOES TO WASTE THERE REALLYS 
IT IS CRIMINAL REALLY YOU DON'T 
THROW ANYTHING OUT AT ALL 
I WORK 
IN PROFESSIONAL KITCHENS L. HAVE 
SPENT YEARS WORKING OUT HOW TO 
ALWAYS 
AND ZOE MUST ADMIT A ALWAYS FEW THINGS NOW AND THEN I'M NOT 
PERFECT BUT I HAVE GOT HELL OF 
LOT BETTER I REALLY HAVE I'M 
SPENDING TWO THIRDS OF WHAT I WAS 
SPENDING BEFORE I WROTE THE BOOK 
AND WE USE ALMOST EVERYTHING IT IS 
AMAIGZ WHAT 
YOU CAN 
TRANSFORM DO DO YOU IT IS AMAZING WHAT YOU CAN TRANSFORM DO YOU DO A WEEKLY SHOP 
EVERYONE HAS BUSY LIFESTYLES DO 
YOU WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU L. WORK 
I'M MUM L. DO WEEKLY SHOP IT 
TENDS TO BE ONLINE THAT'S HOW I 
SHOP YOU SHOP DIFFERENTLY 
I TEND 
TO SHOP WHEN I CAN BUT THE IDEA OF 
THE BOOK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
THING IS PLANNING AND THAT'S WHAT 
IS GOING TO SAVE ALL THE FOOD 
FASCINATING THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
A SUBJECT THAT HAS EXERCISED YOU 
THIS MORNING WE ARE DOING SERIES THIS WEEK ABOUT GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND 
COMMUNITIES THIS MORNING WE ARE 
ASKING WHETHER YOU WOULD ALLOW YOUR 
TEN YEAR OLD TO WALK UNSUPERVISED 
TO LOCAL SHOPS WHETHER YOU WOULD 
FEEL SAFE DOING SO TWENTY YEARS AGO 
MOST PARENTS WOULDN'T HAVE WORRIED 
BUT NOT IT SEEMS ANY MORE A 
WIDE RANGING NEW SURVEY FOR 
BREAKFAST HAS DISCOVERED MORE THAN 
HALF OF YOU WON'T LET YOUR CHILDREN 
OUT BY THEMSELVES SO HAVE 
NEIGHBOURHOODS REALLY CHANGED THAT 
MUCH OR ARE WE MORE SCARED OF WHAT 
MIGHT HAPPEN DAVID SILLITO HAS 
BEEN TO CHESHUNT IN HERTFORDSHIRE 
TO TRY TO FIND OUT 
THIS IS THE LOLLY TEST ARE YOU 
ALLOWED TO WALK TO YOUR LOCAL SHOP 
ON YOUR OWN 
WELL THE ANSWER FOR THIS LITTLE 
GROUP OF TEN AND ELEVEN YEAR OLDS WAS 
FOR THE MOST PART NO 
MY MUM AND DAD DON'T WANT ME GOING 
OUT ON MY OWN 
I HAVE TO GO WITH A 
FRIEND MY MUM IS PROTECTIVE OF ME 
YOU CAN'T GO ON YOUR OWN YET SMOO 
NO YOU CAN'T GO TO THE SHOP ON 
YOUR OWN NO 
THE AGE OF FREE RANGE NO CHILDREN IS IT SEEMS OVER JOE'S 
MUM JILL FELT THE FREEDOM SHE WHAT 
HAD WAS NOW IMPOSSIBLE DO YOU 
THINK IT IS BAD HE HAS NEVER BEEN 
TO THE SHOP ON HIS OWN 
HE HAS WITH 
A FRIEND AND WITH HIS BROTHER L. DO 
FEEL IT IS BAD BUT I WOULDN'T TRUST 
HIM IT IS NOT HIM THAT I TRUST IT 
IS OTHER PEOPLE 
HE WON'T GET INTO 
TROUBLE WILL HE 
OF COURSE HE WILL 
OF COURSE HE WILL IT IS JUST NOT 
SAFE ANY MORE FOR OUR CHILDREN ARE ARE YOU SURE 
YES I'M SURE I'M VERY 
SURE 
WHERE ARE WE GOING TO FIND SURE HIM HE IS GOING TO BE HERE JOSEPH JOSEPH NOW IT IS NOT JUST JILL AND JOE 
REALLY ABOUT WELL SIX OUT OF TEN 
PARENTS BELIEVE IT IS NO LONGER 
SAFE FOR A TEN YEAR OLD TO GO TO 
THE SHOPS ON THEIR OWN ONE HUNDRED YARDS 
IS AS FAR AS SHE IS ALLOWED TO GO 
ON HER OWN DEFINITELY I WOULDN'T 
ALLOW HER TO GO ANY FURTHER L. KNOW 
I HATE THAT L. USED TO LOVE GOING 
OUT I FEEL THEY MISS OUT ON IT 
HAS ANYTHING HAPPENED AROUND HERE 
NO NOT AS YET IT IS JUST THE 
UNKNOWN ISN'T IT SO DOES IT 
MATTER WELL RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN 
USING WRISTBANDS LINKED TO 
SATELLITES TO MONITOR HOW CHILDREN 
MOVE AROUND CHESHUNT THEY HAVE 
NOTICED BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN THEY 
ARE ALLOWED OUT ON THEIR OWN I'M I'M WALKING ALONG SENSIBLY EVEN WHEN 
MY CHILDREN ARE WALKING NORMALLY 
THEY RUN AROUND LIKE THAT BUT WHEN 
THEY ARE OUT BY THEMSELVES THEY ARE 
EXPLORING AND TALKING TO EACH 
OTHER AND INTERACTING IN A MORE 
LIVELY INTERESTING WAY 
FIFTEEN MINUTES 
FOLLOWING ELLIE AND SOPHIE RATHER 
PROVED THE POINT THEY MEANDERED 
MOOCHED EXPLORED AND RAN ABOUT 
MORE THAN THEN THEY WERE WITH 
ADULTS I DON'T UNDERSTAND LIKE WHY 
US TWO ARE NOT ALLOWED OUT THAT 
MUCH HOWEVER JAMES DID PASS THE 
LOLLY TEST BUT HIS MUM'S STILL 
WORRIED WORRIED I THINK IT IS A VERY NICE 
NEIGHBOURHOOD TO BE PERFECTLY 
HONEST I HAVE HAD NO TROUBLE WITH 
IT BUT IN THE BACK OF MY MIND 
THERE IS SOMETHING THERE FROM FROM WHERE WHAT 
THE TELEVISION 
AND IT IS THE SORT OF PLACE THAT 
PEOPLE MOVE TO TO BRING UP 
CHILDREN TO GIVE THEM SPACE BUT 
ALLOWING THEM OUT INTO IT IS 
DIFFERENT MATTER 
THAT'S ENOUGH EXERCISE FOR ME FOR 
ONE DAY 
DAMION QUEVA IS PUBLISHER 
OF DAD'S MAG AND A FATHER AND LIZ 
FRASER IS THE AUTHOR OF THE YUMMY 
MUMMY HANDBOOKS AND THE MOTHER OF 
THREE THREE DAMION KIDS YOU HAVE TWO HAVEN'T 
YOU 
I HAVE A FIVE YEAR OLD YOU DAUGHTER AND A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER 
THE FIVE YEAR OLD YOUNG TO LET OUT 
ON HER OWN BUT THE THIRTEEN YEAR OLD 
THE THIRTEEN YEAR OLD NOW L. REMEMBER 
WHEN SHE WAS TEN WE FELT IT WAS 
BORDERLINE WE FELT SHE NEEDED TO 
BE MORE STREET WISE SO THE EXTRA 
TWO YEARS MADE A DIFFERENCE TO HER 
HEIGHT AND HER CONFIDENCE AND 
DEPORTMENT SETTS L. THINK THAT'S 
THE WHOLE POINT IT IS ABOUT BEING 
STREET WISE AND WHEN IT IS RIGHT 
FOR YOUR CHILD REALLY TO BE ABLE 
TO TAKE A TRIP TO THE SHOPS 
DEPENDING ON HOW FAR IT IS 
WHEN IS 
IT RIGHT IS THERE AN IDEAL AGE 
THAT MAKES SENSE EVERY CHILD IS 
DIFFERENT I HAVE A TEN YEAR OLD 
DAUGHTER SHE GOES TO THE SHOPS BY 
HERSELF SHE GOES OUT OF MY HOUSE 
DOWN THE ROAD PRESSES THE BUTTON 
CROSSES ANOTHER STREET AND GOES TO 
THE CO OPUS HER EIGHT YEAR OLD 
SISTER IS MUCH LESS MATURE AND 
SMALLER I'M NOT SURE WHEN SHE IS 
TEN SHE IS READY TO DO THAT SO IT 
DEPENDS ON THE PERSON BUT I THINK 
WE HAVE BECOME OVERLY FRIGHTENED 
AND WORRIED TO A POINT OF HYSTERIA 
OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN 
WELL LOTS 
OF BAD THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN AND LOTS 
OF BAD THINGS MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED A 
LONG TIME AGO BUT AS WE LET OUR 
CHILDREN OUT LESS AND LESS AND LESS 
THEY ARE BECOMING LESS ABLE TO 
JUDGE THINGS FOR THEMSELVES SO IT 
IS SELF PERPETUATING 
THE POINT WAS 
MADE THAT CHILDREN NEED TO LEARN 
SKILLS OF HOW TO SURVEY OF ON THE 
STREET AND WHAT TO PICK UP ALMOST 
SUBCONSCIOUSLY 
EXACTLY L. HATE TO SUBCONSCIOUSLY PERPETUATE IT BUT IT IS A 
PROTECTIVE THING L. COME BACK ON 
ONE SIDE I AGREE AND I SAY THE 
ONLY WAY THEY ARE GOING TO LEARN IS 
TO GO OUT BUT AT THE SAME TIME I 
DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE RISK WITH MY 
DAUGHTER'S LIFE 
EVEN THOUGH THEY 
ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE VICTIMS OF 
CRIME 
YES YOU LOOK AT THE CRIME ALTERNATIVES AND THINK THEY WILL BE 
O. K. GIVE THEM A MOBILE PHONE IF 
THEY ARE NOT BACK IN FIVE MINUTES 
WE WILL CALL THEM BUT GIVE THEM A 
MOBILE PHONE AND SOMEBODY WANTS TO 
TAKE IT OFF 
THAT'S THE DANGER THAT 
HAS HAPPENED WITH MY CHILDREN AND 
THEIR FRIENDS THEY CARRY A MOBILE 
PHONE AND YOU COULD BE A VICTIM 
HAVING SAID THAT WE WERE TALKING 
ABOUT CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN HAVE 
CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN GONE UP 
HAVE CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN GONE 
UP 
THEY ARE NOT RECORDED IN THE UP SAME WAY NOW AS THEY WERE RECORDED 
IN THE FORTIES AND FIFTIES AND MANY THINGS 
WERE NOT RECORDED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE 
TO GET THE DATA TO SAY WHETHER 
THINGS HAVE IMCREASED OR NOT 
LANGUAGE LIKE PUTTING MY CHILD'S 
RISK BY GOING TO THE SHOP IT IS 
EMOTIVEMENT YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO 
WIN THE LOTTERY THAN YOUR CHILD IS 
GOING TO BE ABDUCTED BETWEEN HERE 
AND THE SHOP 
HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU WERE 
ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN 
VERY YOUNG 
THE SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND 
NEIGHBOURHOOD CHANGED WE HARDLY 
KNOW OUR NEIGHBOURS WE USE TODAY 
LEAVE OUR DOORS OPEN WE ARE 
PROTECTIVE OVER OUR POSSESSIONS WE 
USE TODAY LOOK AFTER THE FENCE AND 
EVERYONE USE TODAY TALK OVER THE 
FENCE FENCE BUT WE DON'T HAVE 
THAT SECURITY BLANKET P. BLANKET 
DON'T WE HAVE TO START BREAKING 
THIS CYCLE 
WE DO WE DO BUT WE 
LIVE IN THIS AND YOU'RE RIGHT WE 
PERPETUATE IT BUT AT THE SAME TIME 
WE WALK DOWN THE ROAD AND COME 
ACROSS A PERSON THAT LOOKS SLIGHTLY 
THREATENING I DON'T WANT MY 
DAUGHTER OR SON TO FEEL LIKE THAT 
AND IF I FEEL I'M TAKING A RISK 
BETTER NOT SOMETIMES 
I AGREE 
A DIFFICULT ONE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE TIME IS JUST AFTER EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY FIVE WE 
HAVE THE FIRED APPRENTICES

HE DOESN'T DO THAT 
LOAF NICE TO SEE YOU 
THE OLYMPICS THEY ARE JUST THREE 
MONTHS AWAY AND SOME OF THE WORLD'S 
PARALYMPIC SPORTSMEN AND WOMEN ARE 
IN MANCHESTER FOR THE PARALYMPIC 
WORLD CUP 
THE COMPETITION WILL BE THE BIGGEST 
YET CLOSE TO FOUR HUNDRED ATHLETES FROM FORTY FIVE 
DIMP COUNTRIES DIFFERENT 
COUNTRIES COUNTRIES CHRIS HOLLINS HAS BEEN ALLEGEDLY 
PLAYING BASKETBALL 
I HAVE BEEN THROWN OFF COURT 
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE MIGHTY GERMANS 
AND AMERICANS WARMING UP 
THEY ARE GEARING UP FOR BAY BEIJING 
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE OLYMPIC 
GAMES OR THE PARALYMPIC GAMES WE 
THINK ABOUT ROWING ESPECIALLY IF 
YOU ARE BRITISH AND THE 
PARALYMPIANS ARE TRYING TO MAKE 
HISTORY THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT BEING IN 
THE BRITISH ROWING TEAM WINNING IS 
EVERYTHING AND SECOND PLACE IS 
NOWHERE AND AS THEY PREPARE FOR 
THEIR FIRST PARALYMPIC GAMES GOLD 
MEDALS ARE VERY MUCH ON THE AGENDA 
THIS IS TOM HE HAS BEEN ROWING FOR 
UNDER TWO YEARS AFTER SUSTAINING 
SPINAL INJURY AND HAS ALREADY ONE 
OF THE WORLD'S BESTMENT 
BEST 
I HAVE SEEN YOU WHIZING UP AND DOWN 
THE WATER THE BOATS LOOK ROUGHLY 
THE SAME BUT HOW DOES IT WORK FOR 
YOU IN THIS BOAT 
THE MAIN 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS BOAT AND 
CONVENTIONAL ROWING BOAT THE SHELL 
IS WIDER 
WE USE STRAPS TO STRAP OURSELVES IN 
WE USE FLOATS WHICH JUST HELPS WITH 
STABILITY ALL THE STROKE COMES 
FROM YOUR UPPER BODY 
HOW DOES IT WORK SHOW ME A STROKE 
AS YOU COME FORWARD YOUR BODY IS 
BRACED AGAINST THE STRAP YOU LOCK 
ON THIS POSITION AND THEN PULL 
THROUGH BACK UP TO YOUR CHEST SO 
ALL THE ACTIONS ARE GENERATED FROM 
YOUR UPPER BODY AND YOUR ARMS 
AND DON'T WORRY YOU DON'T NEED 
SHOULDER THE SIZE OF HOUSE TO BE 
AT THE TOP THIS IS ANOTHER WORLD 
CHAMPION CHAMPION LOOK AT THE DISTANCE SHE IS FOR 
THE FIRST TIME THE WORLD CHAMPION 
WHAT SHE LACKS IN IN INCHES SHE 
MAKES UP FOR IN TECHNIQUE AND 
DETERMINATION DETERMINATION I'M ALWAYS MOCKED FOR HAVING THE 
SHORTEST ARMS IN THE ROWING WORLD 
IT IS A CASE OF STRENGTH AND 
APPLICATION APPLICATION THE OTHER THING THAT WAS SUGGESTED 
BECAUSE YOU ARE UNABLE TO USE YOUR 
LEGS AND YOU ARE USING YOUR UPPER 
BODY YOU MIGHT BE WORKING HARDER 
THAN THE LAZY TIKES LIKES PIN SENT 
AND REDGRAVE 
SOME OF THEM WOULD BE 
PURR TESHD ABOUT GOING OUT IN A 
BOAT AND ROWING ARMS ONLY MAYBE WE 
WILL GET THE OLYMPIC TEAM TO COME 
AND DO AN ARMS CHALLENGE AND RACE 
RACE US IN AN ARMS ONLY BOAT 
LET ME INTRODUCE TO YOU A 
PARALYMPIAN LEGEND AND I THINK AN 
OLYMPIC LEGEND NATALIE DU TOIT 
NATALIE IS THE FIRST AMPUTEE TO 
QUALIFY FOR BOTH GAMES HAS IT BEEN 
AN ALL TIME DREAM 
I THINK 
DEFINITELY AN ALL TIME DREAM L. 
STARTED SWIMMING WHEN I WAS SIX BY 
THE TIME I WAS FOURTEEN AND SIXTEEN I MISSED 
OUT ON THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN SYDNEY 
AND JUST BY LESS THAN ONE SECOND IN 
MY THREE MAIN RACES L. HAD MY MOTOR 
BIKE ACCIDENT THE NEXT YEAR SO 
SORT OF HOPES GOT DASHED A BIT BUT 
TO GO TO THE OLYMPICS I THINK IT 
IS EVERYBODY'S DREAM FOR ME TO BE 
ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR THE OLYMPICS 
NOW HAS PRETTY MUCH BEEN THE TIP OF 
THE ICEBERG 
AN INCREDIBLE STORY 
FOR YOU 
I THINK I HAVE GONE OUT 
THERE AND WORKED HARD L. THINK THE 
RACES ARE FABULOUS L. HAD MY 
MANAGER HER DAUGHTER HER HUSBAND 
MUCH EVERYBODY BACK AT HOME MY 
FAMILIAR LANE FRIENDS ALL THE 
PEOPLE CLOSE TO ME ALL ROOTING FOR 
ME I HAD ALL THE GOOD WISHES IT 
WAS TO REMEMBER IT IS JUST ONE RACE 
AND YOU HAVE TO TRY TO COME TOP TEN 
IF I HADN'T I WOULD HAVE TO GO TO 
BEIJING LATER AND ACTUALLY QUALIFY 
BY COMING TOP NINE THERE I'M GLAD 
I MADE IT EASY ON MYSELF I'M 
QUALIFIED ALREADY L. THINK COMING 
FOURTH WAS THE BONUS HALF WAY 
THROUGH THE RACE I REALISED I WAS 
LYING THIRD L. KNOW EVERYBODY COMES 
BACK IN THE LAST MILE ONE 
KILOMETRE SO I HAD TO PICK UP THE 
PACE A BIT AND TRY AND STAY AHEAD 
OF THE PACK L. WENT OUT THERE AND 
TRIED MY BEST AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR 
THE PLACING THAT I CAME 
WHAT DOES 
THIS MEAN FOR THE PARALYMPIC 
MOVEMENT WE SPEAK TO SO MANY 
PEOPLE WHO SAY YOU ARE THE SHINING 
LIGHT 
THE PARALYMPICS IS ONE OF LIGHT THOSE EVENTS WHERE YOU ONLY HAVE 
REAL SPRINT EVENTS L. WILL BE 
TAKING PART IN THE ONE HUNDRED FREESTYLE IN 
THE PARALYMPIC WORLD CUP 
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A LONG DISTANCE 
SWIMMER BUT PARALYMPICS I AM 
DISABLED WHEN I WALK UP THE STAIRS 
I STRUGGLE L. CAN'T RUN YET L. KNOW 
I'M DISABLED WHEN I GO TO THE 
PARALYMPICS A RACE IS RACE YOU GO 
THERE AND GIVE IT YOUR EVERYTHING 
PAR LICHICS IS STILL GREAT AND 
IMPORTANT I WENT TO MY FIRST 
PARALYMPICS IN ATHENS IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND

COMPANY SAYS IT HAS COME UP WITH A 
DESIGN WHICH IS ACCESSIBLE FOR 
DISAIBD PEOPLE AND PUSHCHAIRS 
CAPOCO CLAIM THE BUS COULD BE MADE 
WITHIN THE MAYOR'S BUDGET OF 
ZERO PERBUS AND COULD BE ROLLED 
OUT IN THREE YEARS SET TO BE 
ANOTHER DRY AND SUNNY DAY 
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PER PUSS BUS 
ANOTHER DRY AND SUNNY DAY THE 
POLLEN COUNT WILL ALSO BE HIGH 
THAT'S ALL FOR NOW 
WELCOME BACK THERE WAS A DRAMATIC 
TWIST IN SIR ALAN'S BOARDROOM THIS 
WEEK NOT ONE BUT TWO APPRENTICES 
SHOWN THE DOOR THE CANDIDATES WERE 
SENT TO MOROCCAN TO BUY AMONG 
OTHER THIDGES KOSHER CHICKENS AND 
GREEN ALARM LOOKS AMID THE 
HAGGLING IN MARRAKECH THERE WERE 
DARK TALES OF CHEATING AND SPYING 
WEREN'T THERE BRIBERY ALL SORTS 
OF THINGS JENNY WAS BOOTED OUT 
FIRST BY SIR ALAN WHILE RENAISSANCE 
PROJECT MANAGER JENNIFER WAS 
SACKED FOR HER LACK OF CONTROL 
THAT'S IRISH JENNY WE WILL CHAT TO 
THEM IN MAIN 
IS OH THEY LOOK SCARED FIRST LOOK 
AT THIS 
YOU DON'T REALLY 
IT SEEMS TO ME 
THAT YOU HANG ON EVERY WORD THAT I 
SAY AND THEN TURN IT ON YOUR 
COLLEAGUES YOU HAVE CHANGED YOUR 
STORY ON THE KOSHER ARGUMENT AND 
THEN TRIED TO PLACE THE BLAME ON 
YOUR TEAMMATE WHO YOU WERE RUNNING 
AROUND WITH NO GOOD NO GOOD 
SORRY SAME OLD STORY JENNY YOU 
ARE FIRED GOODBYE 
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY THE OTHER 
JENNIFER WENT L. WILL TELL YOU WHY 
BECAUSE I THINK SHE WAS A BIT OF 
SNAKE I THINK SHE TAKES WORDS FROM 
MY MOUTH AND TURNS IT ON PEOPLE IN 
THIS BOARDROOM 
CLAIRE ALEX 
SEEMED TO THINK YOU SCUPPERED ONE 
OF HIS NEGOTIATIONS AND THE SIXTY 
LOST ON THAT BED COVER COULD HAVE 
COST THIS TEAM A VICTORY BUT IT 
DIDN'T DIDN'T BECAUSE THE REAL LOSS WAS DUE TO 
THE MISTAKES THAT WERE MADE AND 
THOSE MISTAKES WERE BASED UPON WHAT 
I CONSIDER TO BE SOMEBODY OUT OF 
CONTROL CONTROL SO JENNIFER YOU ARE FIRED 
THANK YOU 
YOUR FACE YOU LOOKED LIKE THUNDER 
WERE YOU EXPECTING TWO FOR THE 
PRICE OF ONE 
DEFINITELY NOT IT 
HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE L. 
HAD HAD BARELY SAT DOWN IN MY SEAT AND 
I WAS OFF OUT AGAIN 
IN ALL SENSES 
OF THE WORD LET'S FACE IT A SNAKE 
HE CALLED YOU JENNIFER 
I THINK HE 
GOT ME ALL WRONG TO BE HONEST L. 
WAS DISAPPOINTED IT GOT TO THAT 
LEVEL WHERE WE WERE GETTING 
PERSONALLY ATTACKED L. WAS 
DISAPPOINTED IN HIS DECISION 
RIGHTLY SOW FIRED ME BUT HE SHOULD 
HAVE FIRED MICHAEL L. THINK IT WAS 
A CONTRADICTION HE FIRED JENNY AND 
MICHAEL WAS AS RESPONSIBLE 
IN YOUR 
VIEW IT WASN'T A KOSHER DECISION 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN 
I THINK YOU KNOW 
NOW WE BRING IT UP BECAUSE THERE 
SEEMED TO BE A FATAL LACK OF 
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT THE WORD 
MEANT WHEN YOU WENT TO BUY SOME 
CHICKENS IN MARRAKECH 
HERE WE GO 
EFFORT ANGLAIS 
IN THE MUSLIM HEART EFFORT ANGLAIS OF THE SOUK JENNIFER HAS FOUND 
PLENTY OF CHICKENS BUT KOSHER THEY 
ARE NOT 
ANYONE CAN'T BLESS A 
CHICKEN 
WHO BLESSS THE CHICKEN A CHICKEN A HOLY MAN 
CAN YOU FIND A HOLY MAN 
AND A MOSQUE IS IT FAR FROM HERE 
I DON'T THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO 
TAKE CHICKEN INTO THE MOSQUE 
LOOK HIS HEAD IS GETTING CHOPPED 
OFF 
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF OFF CHICKENS HERE MOST ARE STILL ALIVE 
I SUPPOSE THEY COULD BE KILLED AND 
BLESSED IN A KOSHER WAY BUT THERE 
AREN'T MANY RABBIS 
AM I BEING 
STUPID THAT A KOSHER CHICKEN IS 
JEWISH AND THIS IS A MUSLIM 
COUNTRYER OR DO MUSLIMS HAVE 
KOSHER 
MUSLIMS HAVE KOSHER CHICKEN KOSHER YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE PUT A GUN I I THOUGHT I WOULD GET AWAY 
YOU WERE 
UNFAMILIAR WITH WHAT THE TERM 
MEANT 
I HAD AN IDEA L. DIDN'T KNOW MEANT IN DUBLIN THERE IS NOT A MASSIVE 
JEWISH COMMUNITY AND I DIDN'T KNOW 
WHAT IT MEANT BUT I KNOW WHAT IT 
IS NOW DEFINITELY 
YOU SAID I'M 
THIRTY FOUR IT IS MY BIRTHDAY YOU DIDN'T 
KNOW WHAT IT MEANT AND HE DRAGGED 
YOU OVER THE COALS 
I KNOW I THOUGHT IT WAS MY GET OUT 
OF JAIL FREE CARD HE COULDN'T FIRE 
ME HE WAS DIGGING AND TRYING TO 
MAKE ME FEEL AS BAD AS POSSIBLE FOR 
BEING THE OLDEST PERSON ON THE SHOW 
THIS YEAR BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER 
AT THE END OF THE DAY I KNEW WHAT 
KOSHER MEANT L. KNEW IT MEANT 
LEGITIMATE I DIDN'T KNOW THE FINER 
DETAIL OF HOW YOU WOULD MAKE A 
CHICKEN KOSHER 
YOU HAD THE ADDED 
COMPLICATION OF BEING INVOLVED IN 
SKULL DUGGERY IN TRYING IT SABOTAGE 
AND TRYING TO BRIBE PEOPLE IN THE 
SHOP NOT TO DO IT YOU MUST HAVE 
KNOWN THAT WAS DODGY 
NO I THOUGHT 
THAT WAS GOING TO BE MY GOLDEN 
MOMENT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE THE 
MOMENT WHERE SIR ALAN SAID STOP THE 
NEXT FOUR TASKS WE DON'T NEED THEM 
BECAUSE SOMEBODY WAS PREPARED TO 
CHEAT 
NO WHEN IT ROME DO AS THE CHEAT ROMANS DO WE HAD BEEN DOING THESE 
REALLY NITTY GRITTY NEGOTIATIONS 
IT WAS IT WAS A CROSS MY PALM WITH 
SILVER SALES ENVIRONMENT L. 
WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN 
THE U. K. 
THERE IS THAT AND THERE IS 
BROIBRY THE WOMAN IN THE SHOP SAID 
I DON'T NEED THE MONEY YOU 
THOUGHT TO YOURSELF SHE WAS PUTTING 
HERSELF ABOVE SKULL DUGGERY 
GENERAL YOU WERE IN CHARGE 
I HAD 
NO IDEA THAT WAS GOING ON AND PLUS 
IF YOU LOOK AT IT IT WAS MICHAEL 
WHO WAS TRYING TO BRIBE THAT WOMAN 
IN THE SHOP IT WASN'T JUST JENNY 
HE HAS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY YOU YOU BOTH THINK HE SHOULD HAVE GONE 
ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY DEFINITELY 
YEAH HE SHOULD HAVE GONE 
WELL FOR 
HIM TO SAY I'M A DEPOOD JEWISH 
BOY AND HE IS HALF JEWISH AND THEN 
FOR HIM NOT TO KNOW WHAT KOSHER WAS 
WAS 
I THINK THAFT THE WORST WAS THING YOU NEVER GET THE WHOLE 
PICTURE I THINK THAT WAS THE 
WORST THING BUT WHEN YOU GO INTO 
THE BOARDROOM THINGS UNRAVEL 
BIGGER ISSUES ARE MADE MORE AWARE 
OF 
BEFORE WE GO YOUR MONEY IS ON OF WHO 
VERY MUCH ON HELENE L. THINK WHO YOU HAVE SEEN THE TIP OF THE 
ICEBERG SHE IS VERY TALENTED BOTH BOTH OF YOU
