WELCOME TO THE TRANSATLANTIC SESSIONS THE BEST OF NASHVILLE IRELAND AND SCOTLAND 
A HIGHLAND LOCATION ALL TO OURSELVES 
IT'S BEEN CALLED THE GREATEST BACK PORCH SHOW EVER 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR 
IT'S ORGANIC IT'S A NATURAL WAY WE WOULD PLAY AND LEARN TUNES ANYWAY 
AND I HAVE IN SESSIONS OVER THE YEARS BY SITTING DOWN AND HAVING A JAM WITH PEOPLE 
MAYBE THREE OR FOUR TIMES ROUND THE TUNE YOU START TO LEARN IT 
IN A KIND OF WAY IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE USED TO 
FIDDLES DUET 
THE MATERIAL IS EITHER SCOTTISH IRISH OR AMERICAN 
AND THEY ALL HAVE LOT OF THINGS IN COMMON 
BECAUSE BOTH MUSIC FORMS WENT TO AMERICA AND GOT ABSORBED 
INTO THE MAINSTREAM SO THEY FIT TOGETHER REALLY WELL 
THERE ARE NO BIG PUZZLES REALLY 
SUMMER IS A PLEASANT TIME 
FLOWERS OF EVERY COLOUR 
WATER RUNS O'ER THE HEUGH 
AND I LONG FOR MY TRUE LOVER 
AYE WAUKIN O. 
WAUKIN STILL AND WEARY 
SLEEP I CAN GET NANE 
FOR THINKIN' ON MY DEARIE 
AYE WAUKIN O. 
WHEN I SLEEP I DREAM 
WHEN I WAKE I AM EERIE 
SLEEP I CAN GET NANE 
FOR THINKIN' ON MY DEARIE 
AYE WAUKIN O. 
WAUKIN STILL AND WEARY 
SLEEP I CAN GET NANE 
FOR THINKIN' ON MY DEARIE 
AYE WAUKIN O. 
LONELY NIGHT COMES ON 
AND ALL THE LAVE ARE SLEEPING 
I THINK ON MY BONNY LAD 
AND BLEER MY EYES W. I. WEEPIN' 
AYE WAUKIN O. 
WAUKIN STILL AND WEARY 
SLEEP I CAN GET NANE 
FOR THINKIN' ON MY DEARIE 
AYE WAUKIN O. 
WOOH OH 
WE WORKED OUT ALL THE PARTS IN AN HOUR YOU KNOW 
SOME OF THE TIME YOU'D BE WATCHING SOMEONE FROM THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE 
FOR A PHYSICAL CUE FOR A STOP OR A PAUSE OR SLIGHTLY MORE PIANO 
IT'S EXCITING 
MADE UP MY MIND TO GO SOME PLACE SO FAR AWAY 
I HEADED WEST 
WITHOUT A SAD GOODBYE 
NO HUGS OR TEARS THAT WAY 
IT'S PROBABLY FOR THE BEST 
I SENT CARDS ALONG THE WAY 
SAID I WAS LOOKIN' FOR A BRAND NEW LIFE 
BUT I NEVER SETTLED DOWN 
MY WANDERLUST WOULD ALWAYS CUT THE TIES LIKE A KNIFE 
SOMETIMES THE LONESOME WIND 
IT CALLS OUT LIKE IT KNOWS ME 
AND ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS 
WHEN I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO IT SHOWS ME THE WAY 
COS HE KNOWS ME 
MY BROTHER WIND 
HE'S LONELY TOO 
AND HE TAKES ME AWAY 
I ALWAYS LOOKED AHEAD 
I WAS SO AFRAID THAT I'D BE CAUGHT BEHIND 
I FOLLOWED A CROOKED STREAM 
TO PLACES I HAVE NEVER BEEN AND ONE MORE HIGHWAY SIGN 
AND I'M LIKE SOME OTHER GUYS 
I MIGHT COUNT THE HOURS TILL THE DAY WOULD END 
BUT IT'S NOT SO I CAN REST 
FOR ME IT'S THE TIME THAT'S BEST FOR TALKING TO MY FRIEND 
COS HE KNOWS ME 
MY BROTHER WIND 
HE'S LONELY TOO 
AND HE TAKES ME AWAY 
NOW HALF MY LIFE HAS GONE 
THE ONLY HOME I EVER HAD IS THIS OPEN ROAD 
MY SKIN'S ALL CRACKED AND BROWN 
IT'S A MIRROR TO THAT DESERT GROUND 
AND THE DUSTY WIND THAT ALWAYS SEEMED TO BLOW 
AND I NEVER MADE A MARK 
I JUST SCATTERED FOOTSTEPS ON THESE SHIFTING SANDS 
AND WHATEVER PUSHES ME 
IT'S SOMETHING ONLY HE COULD EVER UNDERSTAND 
HE KNOWS ME 
MY BROTHER WIND 
HE'S LONELY TOO 
AND HE TAKES ME AWAY 
AND HE KNOWS ME 
MY BROTHER WIND 
HE'S LONELY TOO 
AND HE TAKES ME AWAY 
I PICKED UP THE FIDDLE AND PLAYED THIS TUNE AND SHE FELL OFF THE COUCH 
SOUND ASLEEP AND IT WORKED SO IT'S A TRUE LULLABY 
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU PLAY THAT SONG ON T. V. 
THEY'LL WAKE UP THE SHOWS OVER AT LEAST THE DIDN'T CHANGE THE CHANNEL 
WE JUST FIT IN WHEN WE MEET 
WE ENJOY WHAT THEY DO THEY ENJOY WHAT WE DO 
AND SOCIALLY OF COURSE IT'S ALL VERY VERY GOOD 
OF COURSE WE ALL GO TO AT EIGHT O'CLOCK 
SOFT GUITAR INTRO 
AS I WALKED OUT IN THE BRIGHT MORNING 
TO TAKE A PLEASANT WALK 
I SAT DOWN BESIDE AN OLD STONE WALL 
JUST TO HEAR TWO LOVERS TALK 
JUST TO HEAR TWO LOVERS TALK MY LOVE 
TO HEAR WHAT THEY MIGHT SAY 
SO I MIGHT LEARN A LITTLE MORE LOVE 
BEFORE I GO AWAY 
P. STANDS FOR PADDY I SUPPOSE 
AND J. FOR MY LOVE JOHN 
W. STANDS FOR FALSE WILLIE 
OH BUT JOHNNY IS THE FAIREST MAN 
JOHNNY IS THE FAIREST MAN SHE SAID 
JOHNNY IS THE FAIREST MAN 
I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY SAYS 
FOR JOHNNY IS THE FAIREST MAN 
GUITARS INTENSIFY 
WELL I WOULD CLIMB A HIGH HIGH TREE 
AND ROB A WILD BIRD'S NEST 
BACK I'LL BRING WHAT I FIND THERE 
TO THE GIRL I LOVE THE BEST 
TO THE GIRL I LOVE THE BEST HE SAID 
THE GIRL I LOVE THE BEST 
BACK I'LL BRING WHAT I FIND THERE 
TO THE GIRL I LOVE THE BEST 
P. STANDS FOR PADDY I SUPPOSE 
AND J. FOR MY LOVE JOHN 
W. STANDS FOR FALSE WILLIE 
OH BUT JOHNNY IS THE FAIREST MAN 
JOHNNY IS THE FAIREST MAN SHE SAID 
JOHNNY IS THE FAIREST MAN 
I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY SAYS 
JOHNNY IS THE FAIREST MAN 
A SCOTTISH FRIEND OF MINE STUART ADAMSON 
MOVED TO NASHVILLE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS OF HIS LIFE 
AND THIS WAS A SONG THAT HE WROTE 
AND TO ME IT'S JUST PERFECTLY STUART 
AND KINDA REALLY TALKS ABOUT HIS STATE THAT HE WAS IN 
AND SO I'M GONNA BRING IT TO THE HOUSE BAND 
AND BRING IT ALIVE 
OH YOU DON'T MESS AROUND WITH A MAN IN BLACK 
YOU WILL SAY SOMETHING WRONG THAT YOU CAN'T TAKE BACK 
YOU WILL GO FOR A RIDE IN HIS AUTOMOBILE 
TO A SPOT IN THE WOODS 
JUST OVER THE HILL 
NO YOU DON'T MESS AROUND WITH A MAN IN BLACK 
YOU DON'T FOOL AROUND WITH A WOMAN IN RED 
YOU'LL WAKE UP ALONE IN A COLD BARREN BED 
AND SHE'LL EMPTY YOUR POCKETS AND TEAR OUT YOUR HEART 
AND LEAVE YOU THE WOUNDS OF A LIFE TORN APART 
NO YOU DON'T FOOL AROUND WITH A WOMAN IN RED 
NO NO NO 
OH YOU NEVER MAKE DEALS WITH A GUY NAMED DOC 
OR YOU'LL HAVE A GUN IN YOUR HANDS BY TWELVE O'CLOCK 
NEATH THE SODIUM LIGHTS WITH YOUR HEART IN YOUR THROAT 
OH YOUR LIFE WON'T AMOUNT TO A BOTTLE OF SMOKE 
OH YOU NEVER MAKE DEALS WITH A GUY NAMED DOC 
DON'T BRING ME YOUR TALES OF TEMPTATION AND LOSS 
THE RAGS OF YOUR DREAM YOUR SHATTERED CROSS 
YOU SEE I'VE HEARD YOUR CONFESSION I KNOW JUST WHO YOU BLAME 
AND IF YOU HAD IT ALL BACK YOU'D JUST LOSE IT AGAIN 
YOU CAN'T BANK ON REDEMPTION IF YOU AIN'T SAVED 
DON'T BRING ME YOUR TALES OF TEMPTATION AND LOSS 
DON'T BRING ME THE PIECES OF YOUR 
SHATTERED 
CROSS 
HEY 
OH 
OH OH 
AH OH OH OH 
HEY E. Y. E. Y. 
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
AFTER THREE DAYS HERE I MEAN IT'S EVERYTHING I HOPED IT WOULD BE 
I ENJOYED IT AS MUCH AS I EXPECTED TO AND MORE 
YOU CAME IN AND GAVE US A BOOST RIGHT WHEN WE NEEDED IT 
YOU MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER ONCE YOU TOUCH IT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
AH WE LOVE GIVING COMPLIMENTS 
NOBODY PLAYS IT AS LOUD AS ME 
IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS GIVING YOU A BOOST 
IT FELT LIKE GETTING ON A VERY FAST BUS
