DRUGS ADVISORS REJECT CALLS TO 
UPGRADE IT TO A CLASS B. DRUG 
NOW POLICE CHIEFS ENTER THE DEBATE 
SAYING CANNABIS SHOULD BE 
RECLASSIFIED RECLASSIFIED ONE OF PRESIDENT MUGABE'S MINISTERS 
SAYS HE WILL FIGHT TO THE LAST TO 
STAY IN POWER 
TAYSIDE POLICE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE 
WOMAN WHOSE SEVERED HEAD WAS FOUND 
ON A BEACH 
MORE TORCH TROUBLE THE CHINESE 
AMBASSADOR IS SET TO PULL OUT OF 
SUNDAY'S LONDON OLYMPIC RELAY 
NO TIME FOR FEAR THE MAN WHO 
SAVED HIS WIFE FROM THE JAWS OF A 
CROCODILE BY JUMPING ON IT 
THE POLL WHICH SAYS MORE THAN HALF 
OF ALL LONDONERS THINK THEY WON'T 
BENEFIT FROM THE OLYMPICS 
THE FUNDRAISING EFFORT BEGINS TO 
HELP THIS MAN KEEP HIS SIGHT 
GOOD AFTERNOON THE DEBATE OVER 
WHETHER TO RECLASSIFY CANNABIS AS A 
CLASS B. DRUG HAS TAKEN ANOTHER TURN 
B. B. C. NEWS HAS BEEN TOLD THAT THE 
OFFICIAL BODY ADVISING THE 
GOVERNMENT ON DRUGS POLICY THINKS 
CANNABIS SHOULD KEEP ITS LOWER 
CLASS C. STATUS THAT APPEARS TO 
CONFLICT WITH THE PRIME MINISTER'S 
VIEW AND THAT OF SENIOR POLICE 
OFFICER WHO IS SAY IT SHOULD BE 
RESTORED TO CLASS B. STATUS 
JUST HOW DANGEROUS CANNABIS IS HAS 
BEEN HOTLY DEBATED FOUR YEARS AGO 
IT WAS DOWNGRADED FROM A CLASS B. TO 
A CLASS C. DRUG THAT'S BEEN 
STRONGLY OPPOSED BY CRITICS WHO 
INSIST IT SENDS OUT THE WRONG 
MESSAGE NICK MILLS STARTED SMOKING 
CANNABIS WHEN HE WAS AT SCHOOL HIS 
FAMILY SAY IT ACTED AS A GATEWAY 
THAT LED HIM INTO HARDER DRUGS AND 
TOOK HIM ON A TERRIBLE JOURNEY 
CULMINATING IN HIS HEROIN INDUCED 
DEATH AGED TWENTY SEVEN 
CANNABIS WITHOUT 
ANY SHADOW OF A DOUBT WAS THE 
GATEWAY DRUG FOR MY SONS TO TRY 
OTHER DRUGS SIMON HAS REPEATEDLY 
SAID THAT THE ONE THING THAT GAVE 
HIM THE RELAXED STATE OF MIND TO 
TRY OTHER DRUGS WAS CANNABIS THERE THERE IS GROWING CONCERN THAT CANNABIS 
ISN'T JUST A SO CALLED GATEWAY DRUG 
BUT IT HAS BECOME DANGEROUS IN ITS 
OWN RIGHT WITH POSSIBLE LINKS TO 
MENTAL ILLNESS RESEARCH PUBLISHED 
HERE AT THE HOME OFFICE EARLIER 
THIS YEAR SUGGESTS CANNABIS IS NOW 
THREE TIMES STRONGER THAN IN THE 
PAST THAT'S BECAUSE THE VARIETY 
KNOWN AS SKUNK NOW DOMINATES THE 
MARKET AND THERE IS PARTICULAR 
CONCERN FOR THE HEALTH OF YOUNG 
PEOPLE THAT PROMPTED A REVIEW OF 
CANNABIS'S LEGAL STATUS BY THE 
ADVISORY COUNCIL ON THE MISUSE OF 
DRUGS THE B. B. C. UNDERSTANDS HOWEVER 
THE PANEL OF TWENTY THREE EXPERTS HAS FOUND 
NO EVIDENCE OF A LINK TO 
SCHIZOPHRENIA AND HAS DECIDED THE 
DRUG SHOULD REMAIN IN THE LOWER 
CLASS C. WOULD MOVING IT TO CLASS B. 
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF ARRESTS OF 
YOUNG PEOPLE INCREASING THE PRISON 
SENTENCES WOULD THAT REDUCE USE OR 
HARM ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE L. 
DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY EVIDENCE 
TO SUGGEST IT WOULD THE COUNCIL'S 
DECISION IS SEEN AS A BLOW TO THE 
PRIME MINISTER WHO HAS INDICATED HE 
FAVOURS UPGRADING CANNABIS BACK TO 
CLASS B. 
WHEN THE REPORT DOES COME 
TO ME AND I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO READ IT WHICH I HAVEN'T BEEN 
ABLE TO YET I WILL MAKE A JUDGMENT 
AND COMMENT AND MAKE A DECISION 
THEN 
SO THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO BE THEN FACED WITH A SERIOUS DILEMMA AND 
THE POSSIBLE PROSPECT OF REJECTING 
THE EXPERTS' VIEW SOMETHING THAT'S 
NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE 
LET'S GET THE VIEW OF OUR POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT JAMES LANDALE WHERE 
DOES THIS LEAVE GORDON BROWN THEN 
IN BIT OF QUANDARY HE LAUNCHED 
THIS REVIEW WITHIN WEEKS OF COMING 
TO OFFICE LAST SUMMER IT WAS PART 
OF HIS ATTEMPT TO RE ENGAGE WITH 
MIDDLE ENGLAND THERE HAS BEEN A 
POPULAR CONCERN ABOUT THIS 
RECLASSIFICATION GORDON BROWN'S 
VIEW IS CLEAR HE BELIEVES IT 
SHOULD BE RECLASSIFIED BACK TO 
CLASS B. HE MADE THAT VERY CLEAR AT 
HIS NEWS CONFERENCE EARLIER THIS 
WEEK THE PROBLEM IS WHAT DOES HE 
DO NOW DOWNING STREET'S HOLDING 
POSITION IS TO SAY WE ARE GETTING 
AHEAD OF OURSELVES THE ADVISORY 
BODY HAS NOT REACHED A FINAL 
CONCLUSION YET THIS REPORT IS 
BASED ON ONE PRESENTATION TO ONE 
MEETING I ANTICIPATE LOT OF 
TELEPHONE CALLS BETWEEN THAT BODY 
AND DOWNING STREET OVER THE NEXT 
MONTH ULTIMATELY THE GOVERNMENT 
WILL HAVE TO MAKE DECISION ABOUT 
WHETHER THEY OVERRIDE THAT OR NOT 
THAT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR 
GORDON BROWN HE WILL BE GOING IN 
THE FACE OF EXPERT OPINION ON THE 
OTHER HAND ADVISORS ADVISE AND 
MINISTERS DECIDE

CHINA'S AMBASSADOR TO THE U. K. HAS 
PULLED OUT FROM TAKING PART IN THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY THROUGH LONDON 
ON SUNDAY PROTESTERS PLAN TO HOLD 
DEMONSTRATIONS ALONG THE ROUTE 
WHICH INCLUDES WEMBLEY AND DOWNING 
STREET LET'S GET MORE DETAILS FROM 
JAMES PEARCE IT'S A SIGNIFICANT 
MOVE JAMES HOW IS IT GOING TO BE 
INTERPRETED 
YOU CAN ONLY INTERPRET INTERPRETED IT IN ONE WAY THAT IS THE CHINESE 
ARE WANTING TO DO EVERYTHING THEY 
CAN TO LESSEN ANY SECURITY RISK TO 
TRY NOT TO GIVE ANY REASON FOR 
ENCOURAGEMENT FOR ANYONE TO COME 
OUT AND PROTEST AGAINST CHINA ON 
THAT ROUTE THIS IS A VERY LATE 
DECISION THE TORCH RELAY TAKING 
PLACE ON SUNDAY SO THREE DAYS 
BEFORE AND EVEN THIS MORNING THE 
ORGANISERS WERE TELLING ME THAT THE 
CHINESE AMBASSADOR WAS STILL GOING 
TO TAKE PART BUT NOW THE CHINESE 
EMBASSY IS SAYING THAT THE CHINESE 
AMBASSADOR HAS BEEN SUMMONED TO A 
HOTEL ROOM WHERE THE DELEGATES THE 
AUTHORITIES FROM THE ORGANISERS OF 
THE GAMES WILL BE GATHERING AND SO 
THEREFORE THE CHINESE SAY SHE WON'T 
BE ABLE TO TAKE PART IN THAT RELAY 
WHO DO WE KNOW WILL DEFINITE I WILL 
BE CARRYING THE TORCH 
A LOT OF 
FAMOUS BRITISH SPORTING NAMES 
STEVE REDGRAVE FOR EXAMPLE DAME 
KELLY HOME ALSO BE ON THE FINAL LEG 
TIM HENMAN AS WELL SO A NUMBER OF 
VERY FAMOUS NAMES DAME KELLY 
HOLMES WILL BE ON THE FINAL LEG 
FREE TIBET HAVE ORGANISED A COUPLE 
OF POTESTS ALONG THE ROUTE SO 
THIS SHOULD BE THE BIGGEST SYMBOL 
OF THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT THE 
OLYMPIC FLAME GOING THROUGH AN 
OLYMPIC CITY IN FOUR YEARS' TIME 
THE IMAGES THE CHINESE WANT THE 
WORLD TO SEE MIGHT NOT BE THE 
IMAGES WE ALL END UP SEEING ON 
SUNDAY SUNDAY PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE HAS 
APPEARED ON ZIMBABWEAN STATE 
TELEVISION FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 
SATURDAY'S ELECTIONS HE WAS SEEN 
MEETING THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF 
SIERRA LEONE 
IN THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION HIS 
ZANU P. F. PARTY CAME BEHIND THE 
MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE WITH 
NINETY SEVEN SEATS A BREAKAWAY FACTION WON 
TEN THE B. B. C. IS ONE OF THE 
BROADCASTERS BANNED FROM REPORTING 
WITHIN ZIMBABWE ORLA GUERIN IS ON 
THE BORDER WHAT IS YOUR 
INTERPRETATION OF HIS APPEARANCE 
AND THIS STATEMENT THAT HE'S NOT 
LOOKING LIKELY TO STEP DOWN EASILY 
WELL I THINK THE INDICATIONS ARE 
THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE IS PREPARING 
TO FIGHT ON IS KEEN TO TRY AND DO 
THAT INTERESTING THAT WE HAVE 
CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM THIS MORNING ON 
STATE TELEVISION THE FIRST TIME 
PICTURES OF THE ZIMBABWEAN LEADER 
HAVE BEEN BROADCAST SINCE HE WAS 
SEEN VOTING ON SATURDAY WE ARE 
TOLD BY ZIMBABWEAN BROADCASTING 
THAT THIS EVENT WAS FILMED THIS 
MORNING AND THAT IT WAS A MEETING 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT MUGABE AND SOME 
AFRICAN OBSERVERS AND I THINK IT 
MAY WELL BE THE CASE THAT AS MUCH 
AS ANYTHING HE WAS KEEN TO DAMPEN 
DOWN SOME OF THE WILDER RUMOURS AND 
THE WILDER SPECULATION IN HARARE 
WHICH WOULD HAVE HAD YOU BELIEVE 
THAT HE HAD ALREADY LEFT THE 
COUNTRY NOW WE HAVE OF COURSE 
ALSO HAD THAT OFFICIAL STATEMENT 
FROM ZIMBABWE'S DEPUTY INFORMATION 
MINISTER ABOUT THE WHOLE QUESTION 
OF A RUN OFF WHICH IS THE BIG 
QUESTION NOW ABOUT THE FUTURE OF 
ZIMBABWE AND THE FUTURE OF THE 
PRESIDENT IF THERE IS TO BE A RUN 
OFF FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE AS 
APPEARS LIKELY WILL ROBERT MUGABE 
TAKE PART THE DEPUTY INFORMATION 
MINISTER SAYS YES HE IS READY AND 
YES HE BELIEVES THAT HE WILL WIN A 
VICTORY IN THAT VOTE REALISTICALLY REALISTICALLY WOULD EITHER SIDE RELISH A RUN OFF 
I THINK THERE ARE FEW DIFFERENT 
SCENARIOS THAT COULD PLAY OUT 
CERTAINLY IT WOULD SEEM AS IF 
ROBERT MUGABE IS IN NO HURRY TO 
MAKE A QUICK EXIT WE CAN'T BE SURE 
WHAT STRATEGY HE IS APPROACHING 
BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN NO PUBLIC 
COMMENT FROM HIM SINCE HIS IF YOU 
LIKE HIS DEFEAT IN THE POLLS ON 
THE PARLIAMENTARY VOTE THAT WAS A 
BIG HUMILIATION FOR ROBERT MUGABE 
ZANU P. F. THE RULING PARTY HAVE 
LOST CONTROL OF PARLIAMENT FOR THE 
FIRST TIME SO HE'S ALREADY HAD TO 
TAKE THAT DEFEAT ON BOARD MANY 
LONG TIME OBSERVERS OF MUGABE ARE 
SUGGESTING THAT HE IS REALLY NOT 
THE TYPE OF LEADER TO WANT TO THROW 
IN THE TOWEL THAT HE WILL TRY AND 
PERHAPS BATTLE THROUGH THIS SECOND 
ROUND RUN OFF AND THERE IS 
SPECULATION THAT HE MAY BE ABLE TO 
ARRANGE THINGS IN SUCH WAY THAT 
TIME IS ON HIS SIDE THAT INSTEAD OF 
HAVING RUN OFF IN TWENTY ONE DAYS AS HAD 
BEEN EXPECTED BEFORE THAT HE WOULD 
NOW IMPOSE A DIFFERENT TIME LIMIT 
AND SAY THAT THE RUN OFF WOULD TAKE 
PLACE IN THREE MONTHS NOW OF 
COURSE IF HE CAN DO THAT THAT 
GIVES HIM AMPLE TIME TO MANOEUVRE 
AND HIS OPPONENTS FEAR AMPLE TIME 
TO TRY AND INTIMIDATE VOTERS AND TO 
TRY AND STEAL THE ELECTION MORE 
EFFICIENTLY THE SECOND TIME AROUND 
IT IS STILL UNKNOWN WE DO HEAR 
THERE ARE SOME WITHIN ZANU P. F. WHO 
ARE PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE 
PRESIDENT SAYING YOU HAVE HAD A 
GOOD RUN STEP ASIDE GRACEFULLY 
WE ARE EXPECTING THAT TOMORROW 
THERE WILL BE A MEETING PERHAPS A 
KEY MEETING OF ZIMBABWE'S POLL LIT 
BUREAU THAT IS A GATHERING OF 
SENIOR OFFICIALS IT INCLUDES 
PRESIDENT MUGABE AND HIS MINISTERS 
IT MAY WELL BE THAT AT THAT MEETING 
ZANU P. F.'S STRATEGY IS DECIDED AND 
THAT WE GET SOME CLEARER 
INDICATIONS AFTER THAT FOR NOW I 
WOULD HAVE TO SAY THE SIGNS ARE 
THAT IT LOOKS LIKE HE WANTS TO 
FIGHT ON 
HERE B. T. HAS ADMITTED MONITORING 
THE ACTIVITIES OF EIGHTEEN THOUSAND INTERNET 
USERS WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT SOME 
EX PERS SAY THEIR ACTIONS WERE 
ILLEGAL BUT B. T. SAYS IT TOOK LEGAL 
ADVICE EXPERTS SAY THEIR ACTIONS 
WERE ILLEGAL BUT B. T. SAYS IT TOOK 
LEGAL ADVICE AND DID NOT BREAK THE 
LAW LAW WHETHER YOU ARE LOOKING UP DETAILS 
FOR YOUR NEXT HOLIDAY DESTINATION 
OR JUST BROWSING THE INTERNET FOR A 
RECIPE YOUR PREFERENCES AND 
INTERESTS REVEAL AN ASTONISHING 
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU 
THAT INFORMATION COULD BE EXTREMELY 
VALUABLE FOR ADVERTISERS THE 
TECHNOLOGY THAT TURNS YOUR CLICKS 
INTO HARD CASH IS ALREADY BEING 
TESTED BY MAJOR TELECOMS FIRMS THE 
TECHNOLOGY WORKS BY TRACKING YOUR 
INTERNET SEARCHES SO IF I DECIDED 
I WANTED TO LOSE SOME WEIGHT AND 
ENTERED WEIGHT LOSS INTO A SEARCH 
ENGINE THAT SEARCH WOULD THEN BE 
INTERCEPTED BY THE ADVERTISING TOOL 
AND RELEVANT MARKETING CAMPAIGNS 
FROM DIFFERENT COMPANIES WOULD BE 
SENT BACK TO ME NOW IT'S EMERGED 
B. T. HAS BEEN TESTING THIS NEW 
TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT USERS' 
PERMISSION OR CONSENT INITIAL 
TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT ON EIGHTEEN THOUSAND 
CUSTOMERS IN TWO THOUSAND SIX FURTHER TESTS 
WERE ALSO CARRIED OUT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WE WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS ILLEGAL WE 
HAVE CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE LEGAL OR 
SOUGHT EXTENSIVE LEGAL ADVICE 
INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY AND 
PRIOR TO CONDUCTING THIS TRIAL 
CUSTOMERS WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED AT 
THE TIME IT WAS COMPLETELY 
ANONYMOUS NO PERSONAL INFORMATION 
WAS SHARED NO INFORMATION WAS 
STORED OR DIVULGED 
EXPERTS SAY 
WHETHER B. T. USED THE INFORMATION OR 
NOT THEY BROKE THE LAW 
IT SEEMS 
REALLY QUITE A CLEAR CASE OF 
ILLEGAL INTERCEPTION OF THE 
COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THEIR 
CUSTOMERS AND THE WEBSITES WHERE 
THEY ARE BROWSING 
THE INFORMATION 
COMMISSIONER IS NOW INVESTIGATING 
B. T.'S ACTIONS 
THE JURY AT THE INQUEST INTO THE

THE WOMAN WHOSE SEVERED HEAD WAS

ABROATH ON TUESDAY THEY SAY SHE 
WAS THIRTY SIX YEARS OLD AND FROM BRECHIN 
ANDREW CASSELL IS IN THE CITY AND 
HAS THE DETAILS WHAT EXACTLY HAVE 
POLICE BEEN ABLE TO ESTABLISH AND 
HOW HOW THEY HAVE TOLD US A BIT OF 
INFORMATION AS YOU CAN SEE BEHIND 
ME INVESTIGATIONS ARE FOCUSING ON 
THESE BLOCK OF FLATS WHICH THEY 
HAVE SEALED OFF FOLLOWING A 
MAGNIFICENT RESPONSE TO APPEALS TO 
THE PUBLIC THEY GOT HUNDREDS OF 
PHONE CALLS ONE OF WHICH LED THEM 
TO AN EMPLOYER WHO HAD REPORTED 
THIS THIRTY SIX YEAR OLD MISSING SEVERAL 
DAYS AGO AND IT WAS ONLY ON 
TUESDAY THAT A SEVERED HEAD WAS 
FOUND ON A BEACH IN ARBROATH TWENTY 
MINUTES BY CAR AWAY THEY FOLLOWED 
THAT UP AND THAT BROUGHT THEM TO 
THIS ADDRESS IN BRECHIN THEY SAY 
THEY WILL TALK TO A NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE DURING HEADACHE TO ESTABLISH 
THE LAST MOVEMENTS OF THIS WOMAN 
DURING THE DAY 
OUR TOP STORY C. IS FOR CANNABIS

COLOURFUL EXHIBITION 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS PUBLISHED ITS 
LONG AWAITED MARINE BILL DESIGNED 
TO BETTER REGULATE THE VARIOUS 
ACTIVITIES TAKING PLACE IN U. K. 
WATERS THE BILL WILL INCLUDE NEW 
PROVISIONS FOR PROTECTING 
ECOLOGICA LY 
IMPORTANT AREAS 
REGULATING INSHORE FISHERIES AND 
DESIGNATING AREAS FOR INDUSTRY 
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS SAY THE SEAS 
ARE IN CRISIS AND NEED TOUGHER 
PROTECTION THAN THE GOVERNMENT IS 
LIKELY TO GIVE JEREMY COOKE IS IN 
BRIXHAM ON THE SOUTH DEVON COAST 
I AM AT THIS THE NATURE RESERVE ON 
LAND MUCH WILDLIFE IS GIVEN AT THE 
FULL PROTECTION OF THE LAW BUT THAT 
IS NOT TRUE OF THE SEA THE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT IS ABOUT TO 
CHANGE AND THEY ARE PROPOSING A NEW 
NETWORK OF MARINE CONSERVATION 
ZONES IT IS BEAUTIFUL AND PART OF 
OUR NATURAL HERITAGE BUT WHILE ON 
LAND THERE IS STRICT PROTECTION FOR 
WILDLIFE AND HABITATS ON THE SEE 
IT IS A DIFFERENT STORY UNTIL NOW 
TWO ASCENT OF BRITISH WATERS AMONG 
THE RICHEST MARINE ENVIRONMENTS IN 
THE WORLD ARE SET ASIDE AS 
PROTECTED AREAS THE GOVERNMENT'S 
MASTER PLAN IS TO SAFEGUARD OUR 
SEAS CREATING A NETWORK OF 
PROTECTION ZONES PERHAPS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
SQUARE KILOMETRES WILBY DEEMED 
PROTECTION ZONES CONSERVATIONISTS 
SAY ABOUT TIME 
THERE HAS BEEN SUCH A HOTCHPOTCH OF 
DIFFERENT PIECES ONE PIECE OF 
LEGISLATION ARE NOT COUNTERACTING 
ANOTHER WILL REALLY BE BENEFICIAL 
STOPPING THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY 
TRAWLERS IN SENSITIVE AREAS IS ONE 
OF THE AIMS OF THE MARINE BILL AS 
THIS FISSURE MANAGER KNOWS THE 
PROPOSED RULES MAY LIMIT HIS 
FREEDOM TO FISH AT A TIME HE IS 
BATTLING QUOTA LIMITS AND STRICT 
REGULATIONS BUT HE GIVES THE 
MARINE BILL A CAUTIOUS WELCOME WE WE NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE 
DECISION MAKING ABOUT WHERE THESE 
AREAS GO AND WHAT THEY ARE WHAT WHAT THE RULES ARE 
EXACTLY WHAT 
FISHING WILL AND WILL NOT BE 
ALLOWED 
TODAY'S BILL GIVES A BROAD ALLOWED APPROACH ABOUT HOW BEST TO APPROACH 
WILDLIFE FOR INSTANCE IT LEAVES 
OPEN HOW MUCH OF THE SEA SHOULD BE 
MADE CONSERVATION ZONES AND WHAT 
LEVEL OF PROTECTION THEY SHOULD 
HAVE CLEARLY A LOT OF DETAIL TO 
WORK OUT THIS MAN IS FROM THE 
MARINE PROTECTION SOCIETY GOOD DAY 
FOR YOU 
THIS IS A GOOD STATE THIS 
IS THE ENABLING LEGISLATION WE HAVE 
ASKED FOR FOR SO LONG IT IS THE 
TOOLS IN THE TOOL BOX WHICH WILL 
ALLOW US TO CREATE PROTECTED ZONES 
WE NEED 
YOU HAVE BEEN BATTLING FOR 
THIS FOR A LONG TIME IS IT A LAP 
OF HONOUR OR IS THERE A LOT OF WORK 
TO BE DONE THAT 
WE HAVE HAD B. TWENTY EIGHT 
YEAR WAIT SINCE THE LAST PIECE OF 
CONSERVATION AT LEGISLATION THAT 
BIT OF LEGISLATION DID NOT PROVIDE 
THE NECESSARY POWERS FOR 
CONSERVATION AGENCIES TO AND FORCE 
THESE ZONES AND SET THEM UP WE 
HOPE THE GOVERNMENT COMMITS THOSE 
POWERS TO THE EXPERTS SO WE CAN SEE 
THESE ZONES WORK IN PRACTICE WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE FISHERMEN WHO SAY THEY 
ARE ALREADY LEGISLATED OUT OF 
BUSINESS THEY JUST WANT TO MAKE A 
LIVING AND THIS IS ANOTHER MASSIVE 
PROBLEM 
WE UNDERSTAND THEIR PROBLEM CONSIDERABLE CONCERNS AND 
SYMPATHISE BUT THE SCIENTIFIC 
EVIDENCE FROM ABROAD AND THE 
LOCATIONS WE HAVE IN THE U. K. SHOWS 
THE WAY OF SPECIES INCREASES AND 
THE NUMBER INCREASES SO THEY SPELL 
OUT OF THE ZONE AT WE THINK FOR 
SMALL SITE THIS IS A GREAT SET A 
GREAT STACK WE SHOULD MOVE ON TO 
LARGER ONES IN THE FUTURE 
A LOT TO 
WORK OUT BEFORE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
MORTGAGE LENDERS HAVE TOLD THE BANK 
OF ENGLAND PEOPLE COULD FIND IT 
MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND A HOME LOANS 
IN THE NEXT FEW AMONGST MAJOR 
LENDERS HAVE BEEN RAISING RATES FOR 
WITHDRAWING MORTGAGE IS COMPLETELY 
MORE BUT FOR AT MORE BAD NEWS 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND ASKS LENDERS 
EVERY FEW MONTHS WHAT THEIR VIEWS 
ARE THEY SAY THEY ARE GETTING 
WORRIED ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND HOUSE 
PRICES BECAUSE THEY ARE WORRIED 
THEY WILL LEND LESS BECAUSE IF THE 
ECONOMY GETS INTO A BAD STATE AND 
PEOPLE LOSE JOBS THEY WILL NOT BE 
ABLE TO MAKE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS AND 
IF HOUSE PRICES ARE FALLING YOU 
SELL A HOUSE THE LENDER MIGHT NOT 
GET THEIR MONEY BACK THEY WANT TO 
LEND THE NOW TO PEOPLE WITH BETTER 
CREDIT RATINGS WHO CAN PUT DOWN A 
BEGET DEPOSIT SO THEY ARE PROTECTED 
THINGS COULD GET WORSE BEFORE THEY 
GET BETTER 
LENDERS SAY THEY LENDERS SAY 
THINGS WILL BE THE SAME AS THEY 
HAVE BEEN BUT THEY COULD GET A BIT 
WORSE WORSE THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE STAKING 
THEIR CLAIM TO BEING THE PRACTICAL 
PARTY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT TODAY AS 
THEY KICK OFF THEIR COUNCIL 
ELECTIONS CAMPAIGN LEADER NICK 
CLEGG IS HIM IS INVITING VOTERS 
TO STUDY THE RECORDS OF TOWN HALLS 
WHERE THE LIB DEMS ARE ALREADY IN 
POWER HE SAYS THEY HAVE COME UP 
WITH SOLUTIONS TO HOUSING CRIME 
AND THE ENVIRONMENT OUR POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT REPORTS FROM 
SHEFFIELD WHERE THE LAUNCH TOOK 
PLACE PLACE BACK ON HIS OWN TERRITORY NICK 
CLEGG TOOK THE PARTY'S FIGHT TO HIS 
HOME TOWN THEY HAVE A CHANCE OF 
TAKING CONTROL HERE AT MAYBE HE 
KNOWS A PARTY STILL HAS A JOB TO DO 
TO EXPLAIN WHO THEY ARE SURROUNDED 
BY FRESH FACES AT THE STUDENT UNION 
HE SAID LOOK TO THE SUCCESS OF THE 
EXISTING TWENTY NINE AT LIBERAL DEMOCRAT 
COUNCILS URGING VOTERS TO CONSIDER 
THEIR RECORD 
TAKE A LOOK AT THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS AND MAKE YOUR 
VOTE COUNT FOR REAL CHANGE WHAT WHAT ALSO COUNTS IS THE PUBLIC'S 
APPETITE FOR THE NEW LEADER 
APPETITE HE HAS BEEN IN THE JOB BY 
FOUR MONTHS AND ONLY ONE IT TO BUY A 
WHISPER SO HIS REPUTATION AS THE 
PARTY'S STANDING WILL BE TESTED 
OUR MESSAGE IS THE SAME EVERYWHERE 
WE FIGHT FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES 
WHERE PEOPLE HAVE A SAY THEY ARE 
SARAH THEY ARE SAFER THERE IS 
GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY THAT IS WHAT 
ALL COMMUNITIES WANT 
THE PARTY 
STANDS A GOOD CHANCE OF MAKING 
WAVES HERE AND RECAPTURING THE TOWN 
FROM THE LABOUR PARTY BUT THAT ARE 
MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND COUNCIL SEATS UP 
FOR GRABS ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO IT 
IS A TEST FOR THE PARTY AND A POP 
AND THE PUBLIC'S CHANCE TO GIVE 
THEIR VERDICT ON THE NEW LEADER 
THE GREEN PARTY IS ALSO LAUNCHING

THE FLAB WELL THIS MORNING TWO 
CABINET MINISTERS TOOK THE CHANCE 
TO GET TO GRIPS WITH THE PROBLEM 
AND DEMONSTRATE THEIR OWN AGILITY 
AT THE SAME TIME THIS IS THE 
SCHOOLS SECRETARY ED BALLS AT 
SLADE GARDENS PLAY PARK IN 
STOCKWELL THIS MORNING WELL THE 
SERIOUS POINT TODAY IS THAT LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES ARE GOING TO BE GIVEN 
MONEY TO SPEND BUILDING PLAY AREAS 
AS PART OF THE DEPARTMENT FOR 
CHILDREN SCHOOLS AND FAMILIES' 
NATIONAL STRATEGY ON CHILDREN'S 
PLAY SO CHILDREN AND PARENTS 
ACROSS ENGLAND ARE BEING ASKED WHAT 
THEY WANT SARAH CAMPBELL WENT TO 
BRISTOL TO FIND OUT 
IN SCHOOL PUPILS NEED LITTLE 
ENCOURAGEMENT TO LET THEMSELVES GO 
BUT AFTER SCHOOL IN WHICH 
CHILDREN ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEY 
ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE ON THE 
COMPUTER THAN AN OUTSIDE 
THIS IS A 
LACK OF GOOD QUALITY ACCESSIBLE A 
LOCAL PLAY FACILITIES PART OF IT 
IS POSSIBLY DOWN TO THE PERCEPTION 
OF PARENTS THAT SOCIETY IS NOT SAFE 
AND IT IS GOOD FUN TO SIT DOWN WITH 
A NINTENDO 
OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION IS 
AVAILABLE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO 
IMPROVE PLAY FACILITIES AND IT IS 
HOPED OVER THE NEXT THREE MONTHS 
EVERYONE WILL ADVISE ON HOW THAT 
MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT WITH OVER 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PLAY AREAS BRISTOL IS SEEN AS 
ONE OF THE LEADING LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES IN PROVIDING PLACE 
BASES AND THEY SAY CONSULTING ITS 
YOUNGSTERS IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS 
AT EVERY LOCATION WE DEVELOP AND 
WE TALKED TO CHILDREN WE ASK THE 
TYPE OF EXPERIENCES THEY WANT DO 
YOU WANT TO BE FRIGHTENED WHAT IS 
YOUR EXPERIENCE WHAT DO YOU WANT 
TO DO AND WE BUILD A 
PUPILS AT 
THIS PRIMARY SCHOOL ARE ALL HANDS 
AT DECIDING WHAT THEY WANT THEY 
DESIGNED THEIR STATE OF THE ART 
PLAYGROUND AND ARE FULL OF IDEAS I I WANT A TREE WITH A TREE HOUSE SO WE 
COULD PLAY IN ITS 
VERY BIG 
SWIMMING POOL WITH A ZOOM ROUND IT 
I LOVE ANIMALS 
A BALL PIT ACE 
SLIDE AND A TRAMP LEAN WITH A 
SAFETY NET 
A SLIDE WHICH GOES DOWN 
TO A NET SO NOBODY GETS HURT 
SWIMMING POOLS AND A ZOO MAYBE 
LITTLE AMBITIOUS BUT AS PART OF 
THE CONSULTATION ALL IDEAS WILL BE 
CONSIDERED CONSIDERED NOW HOW IS THIS FOR LOVE AND 
DEVOTION A MAN IN AUSTRALIA 
RESCUED HIS WIFE FROM THE JAWS OF A 
CROCODILE BY JUMPING ON ITS HEAD 
AND POKING ITS EYES WENDY 
PETHERICK WAS STANDING BY A RIVER 
BANK IN A REMOTE PART OF THE 
COUNTRY WHEN THE EIGHT F. T. CROC GRABBED 
HER LEG AND PULLED HER INTO THE 
WATER HER HUSBAND NORM JUMPED IN 
AFTER HER AND HAS SINCE BEEN CALLED 
A HERO 
BULLARD REPTILE LAUNCHED AT WENDY 
PETHERICK AS SHE STOOD IN THE 
SHALLOWS AT THE LITCHFIELD NATIONAL 
PARK ONE HUNDRED MILES FROM DARWIN'S IT 
CLAMPED ITS TEETH AROUND HER LEGS 
AND TRIED TO TAKE HER INTO THE 
WATER 
IT GRABS OUT 
OF THE CORNER WATER OF MY EYE A CROCODILE GRABBED ME 
BY THE LEG AND PULLED ME IN L. 
GRABBED HIM BY THE DRAW ON TOP I 
AM A LITTLE PERSON MY FINGER 
GRIPPED ON THE TOP OF HIS JAW AND 
MY AT OTHER THING THEY GRABBED HIM 
ON THE BOTTOM OF HIS JAW AND PUSHED 
HIM TO TRY TO OPEN HIS MOUTH 
IN A 
REMARKABLE ACT OF COURAGE HER 
HUSBAND NORM LEAPT ON TO THE 
CROCODILE'S BACK I 
ON TOP 
CROCODILE'S BACK OF IT AND LOOKED INTO ITS EYES AND 
RELEASED IT 
OFF WITHOUT HER 
HUSBAND BEING FAIR I THINK THE 
CROCODILE WOULD HAVE HAD A CHANCE 
OF GETTING INTO THE WATER AND THAT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF IT 
TRAPS HAVE BEEN SET TO CATCH THE 
CROCODILE RESPONSIBLE WENDY 
PETHERICK IS RECOVERING IN HOSPITAL
