INSPIRATION HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM THE 
CONTOURS OF MAP YOU GET THAT 
WONDERFUL SHAPE IN THERE THE 
AUSSIES LOVE THEIR OUTDOOR LIVING 
WE HAVE A FIRE PIT AND OUTDOOR 
TABLE ALL THE PLANTS HERE ARE 
NATIVE TO AUSTRALIA 
THIS IS SOMETHING I WOULD LOVE TO 
DO AT HOME 
CLARE AGNEW HAS USED THESE TREES TO 
CREATE A SHADY AREA THE DESIGNERS 
HERE DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER ABOUT 
WHAT THEY WILL DO WHEN THEY ALL 
TURN UP AND MAKE THEIR CREATIONS 
YOU CAN START TO SEE OCCASIONAL 
SIMILARITIES THE MOOD OF THE 
MOMENT THIS IS THE REFLECTIVE 
GARDEN LOTS OF SQUARES AND CUBES 
AND LOTS OF GREEN 
IT IS THIS YEAR'S COLOUR THERE ARE SOME INTERESTING TEXTURES 
HERE THIS GUARD EN I LOVE THE 
RAMMED EARTH WALL LOTS OF TEXTURE 
WITH PLANTS TO SOFTEN IT WE HAVE 
THE YORK STONE PAVING HERE WHICH 
IS MIRRORED IN THE BENCH AROUND THE 
BACK WE HAVE THIS ACID EDGED 
BRONZE MIRROR NEXT TO IT THIS 
ROUGH CUT YORK STONE THE TWO 
CONTRAST THE PLANTING IS VERY SOFT 
LOADS OF PERENNIALS THAT AGAINST 
THE HARD LANDSCAPING MAKES THIS AN 
INTERESTING GARDEN THIS GARDEN DESIGNED FOR BUPA 
THERE ARE LOTS OF KURVES COMING 
DOWN THIS DENSELY COLOURED END OF 
THE GARDEN INTO A GREENER RELAXED 
FEEL THIS KURVES ARE PICKED UP IN 
THIS ENORMOUS BALL WHICH SITS IN A 
CIRCULAR POOL OF WATER THAT IS 
REFLECTED IN THE HEAD OF THE 
ANGELICA BY ITS SIDE IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES ARABELLA LENNOX BOYD 
WAS A REGULAR AT CHELSEA AND WON 
FIVE GOLD MEDALS INCLUDING BEST IN 
SHOW IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT NOW AFTER AN ABSENCE 
OF EIGHT YEARS SHE IS BACK THE 
QUESTION EVERYONE IS ASKING IS WILL 
SHE STILL HAVE THE MY DAS TOUCH A 
LIFE LONG PASSION FOR GARDENING 
BEGAN IN HER CHILDHOOD HOME IN 
ITALY 
I WAS BORN IN ROME MY MOTHER 
DECIDED TO COME AND LIVE HERE WHEN 
I WAS ABOUT SEVEN IT WAS AFTER THE 
WAR SHE WANTED TO GET AWAY FROM 
THE CITY THE VILLAGE IS CALLED 
OLIVETTO WHICH MEANS OLIVE GROVE 
THE HOUSE IS CALLED PALAZZO PARISI 
IT HAS CHANGED ENORMOUSLY SINCE I 
WAS A CHILD GARDENING IS A 
COMPLETE OBSESSION FOR ME IT IS 
GARDENING DESIGNING AND PLANT 
GROWING I 
AM MAD ABOUT PLANTS L. AM MAD ABOUT DESIGN WHAT REALLY 
EXCITES ME ABOUT ITALIAN GARDENS IS 
THE ARCHITECTURE THAT GOES WITH THE 
EVERGREEN PLANTING THE IDEA WOULD 
BE TO BE ABLE TO MIX THE ITALIAN 
STYLE AND THE ENGLISH STYLE WHICH 
IS WHAT I TRY AND DO L. SPEND HOURS 
WITH MY WONDERFUL GARDENER CALLED 
MAURICIO HE IS VERY PRECISE AND 
ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT 
E. R. Y. TIME WE CAN DO SOMETHING WHICH 
WILL TAKE US FORWARD THE GARDEN IS 
STILL IN CONSTANT REVOLUTION L. 
THINK I HAVE PROBABLY FINISHED THE 
LAST LEG OF MY PLANNING THE ROSES 
ARE TINY THE IRISES ARE MINUTE IN 
A FEW YEARS I THINK IT WILL LOOK 
REALLY GOOD 
I CAME TO ENGLAND WHEN I WAS TWENTY FOUR 
AND IT WAS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE 
FOR ME BECAUSE I STARTED MY 
GARDENING I HAVE A HOME IN 
LANCASHIRE THE GARDEN WAS A REAL 
CHALLENGE BECAUSE OF THE LANDSCAPE 
WHICH WAS SO INFORMAL AND DID NOT 
ALLOW VISTAS AND ALL THE THINGS YOU 
HAVE IN AN ITALIAN GARDEN IT IS 
FANTASTIC FOR ME TO LEARN L. HAVE 
TRIED OUT FLOWERS I HAVE TRIED OUT 
TREES IT HAS BEEN A LEARNING CURVE 
FOR ME L. DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD 
HAVE DONE MY JOB PROPERLY HAD I NOT 
HAD THAT EXPERIENCE 
ONE OF MY FIRST GARDENS THAT I 
DESIGNED IN ITALY IS LA LIMONAIA 
IT IS ON ONE OF THE HILLS 
SURROUNDING FLORENCE AND IT WAS AN 
OLD LEMON HOUSE BELONGING TO MY 
FRIEND MARIA VITTORIO RIMBOTTI L. 
WAS A LITTLE BIT IN AWE I THOUGHT 
HOW WILL I COMPETE WITH THIS 
AMAZING VIEW OF FLORENCE L. HAD TO 
DO SOMETHING WHICH FITTED INTO THE 
LANDSCAPE USING EVERGREENS AS 
SCULPTURES SURROUNDING BY THE 
LUSHNESS AND RELAXED ENGLISH 
FLOWERS AND SHRUBS 
THE FIRST FEW ROSES ARE HERE 
LOOK HERE THIS BEAUTIFUL ONE SUCH 
A SATISFACTION THEN YOU LOOK AT 
THE FLOWER AND YOU LOOK AT THE VIEW 
AND SOMETIMES YOU WONDER WHAT IS 
MUCH NICE 
ANOTHER OF MY ITALIAN 
GARDENS IS HERE IN THE MAREMMA THE 
HOUSE IS CALLED LA BANDIERA THE 
GARDEN IN THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE IS 
ACTUALLY ON A GARAGE BECAUSE THE 
OWNER DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE CARS 
IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE L. WAS ONLY 
GIVEN ABOUT FIFTY CENTIMETRES OF SOIL 
ONLY THING I COULD PLANT WAS BOX 
AND LAVENDER L. DESIGNED THIS 
FORMAL PATTERN AT THE CENTRE A 
FOUNTAIN WHICH IS PLEASANT IN THE 
SUMMER THERE IS THE SOUND OF THE 
WATER WATER IRISES DO INCREDIBLY WELL IN THIS 
PART OF ITALY SO I PLANTED THEM 
EVERY WHERE PARTICULARLY IN AN 
AREA WHERE I PLANTED JUDAS TREES 
THE WHOLE AREA IS COVERED IN IRIS 
OF EVERY COLOUR L. WENT ABSOLUTELY 
MAD IT IS SUCH FUN TO COME BACK 
HERE AND SEE THEM DO SO WELL L. 
MEAN THEY LOOK ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
I AM A LITTLE BIT OF A GYPSY 
HAVING LEFT MY COUNTRY OF BIRTH TO 
GO TO ENGLAND L. THINK THAT ONCE 
YOU HAVE DONE THAT YOU BECOME 
SLIGHTLY DETACHED SO REALLY I 
FEEL AT HOME WHEREVER MY FAVOURITE 
PLANTS ARE OR MY FAVOURITE DESIGN 
THAT IS WHAT I AM REALLY ATTACHED 
TO 
SO AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF NO WORK NO 
CHELSEAS WHAT TEMPTED YOU BACK I I SUPPOSE THE EXCITEMENT OF BEING 
ABLE TO DO SOMETHING YOU REALLY 
WANT TO DO AT THAT MOMENT WITHOUT 
ANY CONSTRIKETION OR CLIENTELEING 
YOU YOU SHOULD DO THIS OR THAT IT IT GIVES YOU A FREEDOM YOU DON'T 
NORMALLY HAVE HOW HAVE YOU CHANGED 
IN THE PAST EIGHT YEARS DESIGNERS 
NEVER STANDSTILL HOW DO YOU THINK 
YOU HAVE CHANGED 
I HAVE DEVELOPED 
IN I SUPPOSE IN MY KNOWLEDGE OF 
TREES AND SHRUBS WHICH I KNOW MUCH 
BETTER NOW BUT ALSO IN SIMPLIFYING 
MY DESIGN AND REALLY GETTING TO THE 
SORT OF CORE OF THE DESIGN THIS THIS SEEMS TO ME TO HAPPEN TO DESIGNERS 
A LOT L. FIND LESS IS MORE THE 
OLDER YOU GET THE MORE LINE YOU 
WANT THAT IS EXEMPLIFIED THIS THIS 
RETANG LAR CROSS WITH THIS DOUBLE 
CROSSING SERPENTINE OF WATER 
LILLIES IS THIS YOU SAYING THIS 
IS WHAT I DO NOW 
THIS IS WHAT I 
LIKE DOING L. ENJOY THE FACT I WAS 
GOING TO FLOOD THE WHOLE SITE IN 
WATER AND HAVE WATER LILLIES AS A 
MAIN FEATURE AND A VERY SIMPLE YEW 
HEDGE WHICH LEADS THE EYE TO THE 
END OF THE GARDEN WITH ITS SIMPLE 
HER BAYOUS PLANTING AND BAMBOOS 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH HOW IT HAS 
TURNED OUT 
IT IS WONDERFUL L. HAVE 
BEEN ASSISTED BY A FANTASTIC TEAM 
AND WE'VE HAD GREAT FUN AND MOMENTS 
OF ABSOLUTE HORRORMENT HORROR L. L. AM SO HAPPY 
WHILE THE DESIGNERS SPEND MONTHS 
PLANNING THEIR GARDENS THEY GET 
JUST THREE WEEKS TO BUILD THEM 
EVEN EXPERIENCED DESIGNERS LIKE 
ARABELLA FEEL THE PRESSURE SO WHAT 
HAVE THE LAST FEW WEEKS BEEN LIKE 
FOR SHAO FAN A SCULPTOR IN HIS 
NATIVE BEIJING HE'S NEVER DESIGNED 
A GARDEN BEFORE NEVER BEEN TO 
CHELSEA AND NEVER SPOKEN ENGLISH 
WILL HIS TALENT OVERCOME HIS LACK 
OF HORTICULTURAL EXPERIENCE 
TOGETHER WITH LADY DAVIES WHO 
PERSUADED HIM TO MAKE THIS LEAP OF 
FAITH HE'S KEPT A VIDEO DIARY OVER 
THE LAST THREE WEEKS AND BEFORE 
THE BUILD COULD BEGIN THERE WAS 
FIRST BUDDHIST BLESSING WE WERE VERY LUCKY TO GET THE ABBIS 
OF THE BUDDHIST TEMPLE HERE IN 
LONDON TO COME AND BLESS THE 
OPENING OF THE DIGGING TODAY IT'S 
GOING TO BE TWO METRES DEEP THE 
DEEPEST GARDEN EVER DUG I BELIEVE 
AT CHELSEA QUITE A LOT OF EARTH IS 
GOING TO BE REMOVED AND TWENTY CUBIC 
METRES CEMENT IS GOING TO BE POURED 
ONTO THE SITE TECHNICALLY IT'S 
QUITE HAIR RAISING FOR EVERYBODY 
I AM A BIT NERVOUS I'M WORRIED ABOUT FINDING THE 
CHINESE PLANTS THAT I NEED HERE IN 
BRITAIN IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF TIME 
AND A LOT OF ENERGY TO FIND THESE 
AND THE WORKLOAD WILL BE HUGE THE THE ONLY SLIGHT PROBLEM IS THE 
TRANSLATION TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE 
ARTIST REALLY WANTS YOU KNOW HE'S 
VERY CLEAR HERE YOU KNOW HE NEEDS 
TO PROJECT THAT TO US AND EVERYONE 
IS HERE TO HELP HIM YOU KNOW 
BRING THIS TO FRUITION THE ROCK IN THE CHINESE GARDEN IS A 
VERY VERY IMPORTANT ELEMENT YOU 
CAN'T DESIGN ROCKS AS YOU WOULD 
DESIGN BUILDINGS ASSEMBLING ROCKS 
IS A CREATIVE PROCESS BECAUSE IT 
CAN'T BE FULLY PLANNED QUITE A LOT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE 
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE HALFWAY BUT THAT 
HALFWAY POINT DOESN'T EVEN BEGIN TO 
DESCRIBE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WORK 
THAT NEEDS TO GO IN STILL WE CHINESE HOLD 
ANCIENT THINGS IN REALLY HIGH 
ESTEEM IT IS PART OF OUR PSYCHE 
WE WANTED TO FIND REALLY OLD TREE 
BECAUSE IT IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT 
THE GARDEN CONTAINS AN ANCIENT 
BUILDING AND AN OLD TREE WILL GO 
REALLY WELL WITH THE WHOLE GARDEN 
THIS EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN 
EXHILARATING EDUCATIONAL AT TIMES 
QUITE STRESSFUL BUT I THINK THAT 
BY FRIDAY OR SATURDAY WE'RE GOING 
TO HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY GARDEN 
THAT WILL YOU KNOW APPEAL TO THE 
PUBLIC IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS NOT 
MANY OF US HAVE BEEN GETTING MUCH 
SLEEP BUT WE'LL GET THERE WELL LADY DAVIES YOU MIGHT NOT 
HAVE GOTTEN MUCH SLEEP BUT YOU 
CERTAINLY GOT THERE IN THE END WE WE CERTAINLY DID 
IT'S A STUNNING 
GARDEN

ONE MAN HARRY NAGATA PRUS 
PREPARING TO FLY LAUGHWAY AROUND 
THE GLOBE TO FULFIL HIS LIFE LONG 
AMBITION WESLEY KERR REPORTS FROM 
JAPAN NAGOYA SEVENTY MILES EAST OF KYOTO IS 
JAPAN'S FOURTH LARGEST CITY IT'S 
AN INDUSTRIAL HUB WHERE TOYOTA AND 
MITSUBISHI HAVE LARGE FACTORIES AND 
ITS PORT IS THE BUSIEST IN THE 
COUNTRY BUT IT'S NOT JUST CARS 
THAT COME OFF THE PRODUCTION LINE 
HERE INSIDE THIS BUILDING AN 
EXTRAORDINARY COMMODITY IS TRADED 
NOT GOLD OR OIL OR BONDS BUT POT 
PLANTS PLANTS THIS IS JAPAN'S BIGGEST POT PLANT 
AUCTION WITH AN ANNUAL TURNOVER OF

HE STOPPED AND AFTER THE WAR MY 
GRANDFATHER RESTARTED AGAIN A AND 
MY FATHER STARTED TO GROW ORCHIDS 
COMMERCIALLY AND NOW I FOLLOW HIM 
THE ORCHIDS I'M GROWING ARE 
CATTLEYAS THEY ARE ORIGINALLY FROM 
SOUTH AMERICA AND THEY ARE CALLED 
THEY'RE THE QUEEN OF FLOWERS AND 
THEY'RE SO GORGEOUS AND TO ME 
IT'S EASY TO GROW THAT'S WHY I 
SELECT CATTLEYAS TO GROW BUT BUT THEY'RE NOT EASY AT ALL THEY'RE 
REALLY QUITE DIFFICULT ESPECIALLY 
TO CREATE NEW VARIETIES 
IT DEPENDS 
ON YOU KNOW THE GROWER'S 
PERSONALITY I DON'T KNOW WHY I 
CAN GROW FOR AWHILE THE OTHER 
ORCHIDS VERY WELL BUT I DON'T KNOW 
WHY THE CATTLEYAS IS PRETTY GOOD 
FOR ME 
ALTHOUGH HARRY HAS SHOWN 
HIS ORCHIDS AT FLOWER SHOWS AROUND 
THE WORLD THIS IS THE FIRST TIME 
HE'LL BE COMING TO CHELSEA THE THE CHELSEA SHOW IS KIND OF MY FINAL 
TARGET BECAUSE IT'S THE BIGGEST AND 
MOST ADVANCED SHOW SO SOME DAY I

AND THE KIDS WANT A FOOTBALL PITCH 
PLANTSMAN CHRIS COLINS HELPED IN 
THE DESIGN OF THE MARSHLL'S GARDEN 
WHICH HAS BEEN DRAWN ON BY THE 
CHILDREN OF PRIMARY SCHOOLS ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY CHRIS WENT TO CHRIS IT 
IS SOME OF THEM 
GOOD MORNING KIDS MORNING HAVE MORNING I HAVE DONE ALL THESE WORKSHOPS TO GET THE 
PERFECT KID'S GARDEN FOR THE 
CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW SOME OF THE 
STUFF YOU PRODUCED WAS BRILLIANT L. 
WANT TO ASK YOU WHY YOU DESIGNED 
WHAT YOU DID 
THERE IS A TRAM PO 
LEAN SOME TYRES AND THE TREE TO 
CLIMB ON 
WHOI DID YOU CHOSE YELLOW 
ROSES 
THEY ARE ONE OF MY GRAND ROSES MA'S FAVOURITE FLOWERS 
BOYS MOAN 
THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO SO THERE 
IS A FOOTBALL PITCH 
WHAT IS THE 
LOST ALIEN 
IT WAS LIKE SUPPOSED TO 
BE AN ALIEN HAD CRASHED AND HIS 
FEET WERE STILL IN THE AIR 
THAT IS 
HIS FEET THERE IS IT CLASS WE 
TOOK IDEAS FROM OTHER SCHOOLS AND 
SENT THEM OFF TO A DESIGNER HE 
CAME UP WITH THIS PLAN WHAT DO YOU 
THINK OF THAT 
I THINK YOU HAVE TKWOT TO GOT TO 
AGREE IT IS A GREAT PLAN GARDENING 
IS NOT A CLASSROOM SUBJECT WE WILL 
PUT ON OUR HATS AND COATS AND LOOK 
AT THE NOTTINGHAM ARBORETUM AND 
LOOK AT SOME OF THE PLANTS IN THERE YOU WANTED PLANTS WHICH WERE VERY 
TOUGH SO WE COULD FEEL AND TOUCH 
THEM THIS IS THE FIRST PLANT 
THIS IS A JAPONICA LOOK AT THE 
LEAF YOU CAN FOLD IT UP AND IF I 
LET IT GO IT SPRINGS OUT AGAIN IT 
IS GOOD WHEN YOU CAN CLIMB INTO A 
PLANT RATHER THAN SIT BACK AND LOOK 
AT IT GET OUT GEORGE YOU'LL GET 
LOST IN THEREMATE THIS IS ANOTHER 
PLANT THIS IS LIKE A LANCER LEAF 
IT IS SWORD LIKE ISN'T IT YOU CAN 
SEE WHY DESIGNERS LIKE THEM THEY 
STAND OUT THEY ARE STRIKING PLANTS 
THEY LOOK LIKE FIREWORKS AS WELL 
RIGHT FOLLOW ME 
SOME OF THE PLANTS WE HAVE IN THE 
GUARDEN AS WELL THIS IS A IN THE 
GARDEN AS WELL THIS IS A SNAKE 
SKIN MAPEL DOES THAT LOOK LIKE A 
REPTILE TO YOU IT IS NOT IT'S A 
TREE TREE THE PLAN IN THE PLAN WAS WAS THUN 
BIG TREE YOU SEE THIS TREE WITH 
THE WHITE BARK HERE IT IS LIKE 
THAT THE MAIN TREE IN THE CHELSEA 
GUARDIANEN WILL BE ONE OF THOSE 
FROM THAT WE HOPE TO PUT ROPE S. O. S. 
YOU CAN SWING ABOUT AND CLIMB UP IT 
IT LOOKS LIKE A SILVER BIRCH THAT THAT IS BRILLIANT YOU CANNOT LEAVE 
WITHOUT DOING SOME WORK YOU KNOW 
THE BEST THING ABOUT BEING A 
GARDENER IS PLANTING PLANTS THAT 
MEANS IF YOU COME BACK IN FIVE OR 
TEN YEARS TIME YOU SEE YOUR PLANT 
YOU HAVE ALL PICKED A PLANT IN THIS 
BIG BED OFF YOU GO TO PLANT IT 
THEN HAVE YOU HAD A GOOD DAY YES I 
DIDN'T REALISE HOW MUCH FUN IT WAS 
YOU WILL PLANT MORE PLANTS NOW L. 
THINK WE HAVE ALL EARNED A CUP OF 
TEA DON'T YOU 
YEAH WHAT IS THE MOST COMMON MISTAKE 
WHEN WE DESIGN IN GARDENS FOR 
CHILDREN 
WE NEED TO HAND CHILDREN CHILDREN THE BATON AS CHILDREN WE ARE 
RESTRICTED IN OUR WAYS AND THINKING 
WHAT I DISCOVERED WHEN I DID THE 
WORKSHOPS IS THAT KIDS COME UP WITH 
GREAT IDEAS 
TWO OF THE CHILDREN 
ARE HERE THE FAVOURITE BIT OF THE 
GARDEN WHICH IS YOUR BEST BIT THE THE HIDDEN TUNNEL IT IS LIKE COMING 
THROUGH A JUNGLE 
LIKE THE LION 
THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE YES YES YOUR FAVOURITE BIT 
THE ROCK STACK 
YOU CAN GET AWAY FROM THE ADULTS 
AND HAVE SOME OF YOUR OWN TIME YOU YOU SEE CLEAR OFF CHRIS KIERAN HAS 
FOUND HIS ROCKS THE IDEA OF 
BRINGING THIS ALL TOGETHER HOW WAS 
IT WHAT WAS THE HARDEST BIT THE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WAS THE 
EMBARRASSMENT THAT THESE CHILDREN 
OF CRAMMING ALL THE THINGS THAT 
THESE CHILDREN HAD CREATED SO IT 
WORKS TOGETHER AS A COHESIVE GARDEN 
THIS IS AN ADULT TAKING ON BOARD 
CHILDREN'S IDEAS AND MAKE A GARDEN 
WHICH FITS WITH THOSE ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY I THINK WE HAVE ACHIEVED THAT THE THE ONE THING IS LISTENING TO FREYA 
TALKING ABOUT THE TUNNEL I HAVE 
GOT 
TO TRY IT EVERY YEAR SOME DESIGNERS TAKE IT TO THE WIRE AND I AM AFRAID TO SAY 
ANDY STURGEON IS ONE OF THEM NO 
MATTER HOW LATE HE FINISHES THIS 
YEAR'S GARDEN HE BETTER BE BRIGHT 
EYED AND BUSHY TAILED COME THE

FIND THE SCALE OF THE SHOWGARDENS 
INSPIRATIONAL BUT OVERWHELMING 
WELL THERE ARE SMALLER GARDENS 
WHICH ARE LESS DAUNTING 
THERE TWENTY TWO SMALL GARDENS IN HOTEL 
AT THIS IN TOTAL AT THIS YEAR'S 
SHOW TEN OF WHICH ARE COURTYARD 
GARDENS THEY ARE MORE FAMILIAR 
THAN PERHAPS THE URBAN GARDENS THE 
COURT GUARDIANENS OFTEN HAVE 
FEELING OF NOSTALGIA THE GOOD 
GIFTS GUARD SEASON A GREAT EXAMPLE 
OF THE STYLE THIS IS AN EXHIBIT 
DESIGNED TO EVOKE MEMORIES OF NINETEEN FIFTIES 
SEASIDE HOLIDAYS THIS ATTENTION TO 
DESIGN IS AMAZING THE DECKCHAIRS 
AND TOYS ARE AUTHENTIC TO THE 
PERIOD BUT THE PLANTING IS ALSO 
JUST AS NATURE INTENDED DOWN ON 
THE SEASHORE WE HAVE THINGS LIKE 
THE BRASSICAS NATURALLY FOUND 
AMONG THE ROCKS AND CREVICES 
CLINGING TO MEAGRE SOILS ARE FERNS 
AND THE THRIFT THE DORSETS CEREALS 
EDIBLE PLAYGROUND WAS BUILT AND 
GROWN IN DORSET IT IS THE MOST 
INSPIRATIONAL SPACE YOU CAN 
LITERALLY SPELL THE FLOWERS 
CANNOT WAIT TO HARVEST SOME OF THE 
FRUITS A HIGH PROPORTION OF THE 
COURT GUARDIANENS HAVE CHARTIBLE 
INTERESTS THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE T. 
SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OF 
ANIMALS ABROAD IS A RECREATION OF 
MAR RA KESK COURTYARD THIS GARDEN 
BLURS THAT INTERFAIGS BETWEEN 
INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR YOU ARE 
SURROUNDED BY THE SORT OF PLANTS 
YOU COME ACROSS IN THE HEART OF 
MOROCCO WITH INCREASING NUMBERS OF 
US WORKING AT HOME IT HAS NEVER 
BEEN MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE JOURNEY 
TO WORK TO BE A DELIGHTFUL AFFAIR 
HERE A CURVING PATH ENCOURAGES YOU 
TO EXPLORE THE TEXTURE OF THE 
PLANTING TO BE HONEST I DON'T 
THINK I WOULD EVER MAKE IT TO THE 
OFFICE ONE OF THE MORE DRAMATIC IS 
THIS EXHIBIT FROM THE CAYMAN 
ISLANDS THIS IS THE FIRST TIME 
THEY HAVE BEEN TO CHELSEA BECAUSE 
OF THE EXOTIC NATURE OF THE 
PLANTING YOU CAN FIND KNIT THE 
GRAND PAVILLIIAN IT IS A 
CELEBRATION OF THE CULTURE AND OF 
THE PLANTS THIS SILVER THATCH PALM 
WHICH CAN ONLY BE FOUND GROWING ON 
THE CAYMAN ISLANDS AND IS A KEY 
PLANT THEY CREATE BASKETS TO ROPES 
FROM IT 
THESE COURT GUARDIANENS ALWAYS 
REMIND ME OF JEWEL BOXES YOU OPEN 
THE LID EVERYTHING IS THERE BEFORE 
YOU IS THE TEMPTATION WITH THEM TO 
PACK TOO MUCH IN 
THE TEMPTATION IS 
THERE IN A LARGE GARDEN YOU HAVE 
THE SPACE TO DO IT THERE ARE AS 
MANY ELEMENTS IN A SMALL GARDEN AS 
THERE IS IN ONE OF THE BIG 
SHOWGARDENS YOU HAVE GOT TO SORT 
OF SCALE IT DOWN AND NOT 
OVERCONFUSE IT ALSO PUT A FEW BIG 
THINGS IN OTHERWISE IT ENDS UP 
MICROSCOPIC 
IT IS HARDER TO GET MICROSCOPIC IMPACT IN A SMALLER GARDEN IT 
BECOMES TOO FIDLY YOU NEED ONE OR 
TWO THINGS WHICH STRIKE OUT LIKE 
THIS COTTAGE AT THE BACK 
AND THE 
APPLE TREE BEHIND YOU THAT IS 
WHERE YOU NEED TO GET SOME HEIGHT 
GARDENING IS CONSTANT BATTLE 
AGAINST THE ELEMENTS FORECAST 
WHICH SAYS WINDY FROSTY MAKING 
GARDENER'S HEART SINK ONE GARDEN 
HERE HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO WITHSTAND 
THE WORST THE WEATHER CAN THROW AT 
IT 
WHEN I FIRST CAME 
TO SHETLAND IT TO TALK ABOUT THE PROJECT AND FIND 
PEOPLE TO HELP US I WAS AMAZED HOW 
MANY WERE KEEN TO GET ON BOARD WITH 
US US I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THE COMMUNITY 
SPIRIT HERE WHEN WE DECIDED TO DO A SHETLAND 
CROFT GARDEN WE THOUGHT THE FIRST 
THING WE NEEDED WAS A CRAFT WE 
WENT ON SHETLAND RADIO WE GOT NOT 
JUST A CRAFT BUT PLANTS AND OTHER 
BITS AND BOBS FOR THE GARDEN THEY 
MIGHT THINK MIGHT BE USEFUL IT 
MEPBTD WE WERE GOING TO BUILD THIS 
GARDEN AT CHELSEA AND IT WAS GOING 
TO BECOME REAL ALL THESE LICHENS 
THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL COULD WE HAVE 
SOME OF THOSE ON THE FRONT THE 
STONE WORK IS BEAUTIFUL 
IT IS A 
TESTIMONY TO THE OLD MASONS OF THE 
DAY 
WILL WE GET THIS DONE IN THE DAY TIMESCALE WE HAVE GOT YES HAVE YES I HAVE EVERY FAITH IN YOU L. AM SURE WE WILL THE FENCING GATE AT 
THE FRONT OF THE GARDEN HAVE BEEN MADE OUT OF 
DRIFTWOOD BY LOCAL SCULPTOR 
CALLED RUTH FISHER SHE HAS 
COLLECTED ALL THIS WOOD FROM THE 
BEACHES ROUND ABOUT IT IS LOVELY 
TO KNOW IT COULD HAVE COME FROM 
ANYWHERE AROUND THE WORLD 
THIS IS BLEACHED SOMETIMES IT IS 
BLEACHED IN THE OCEAN BEFORE IT 
COMES TO SHORE IT HAS BEEN IN THE 
SEA FOR A LONG TIME IT HAS TWO 
DIFFERENT SEA WORM IN IT THE 
LARGER ONES AND THE SMALLER ONES A 
REALLY INTERESTING PIECE SHALL 
TAKE THAT HOME AND LIVE WITH IT FOR 
A WHILE AND SEE WHAT COMES TO MIND I FOUND THE PEOPLE HERE HOSPITABLE 
BUT THE CLIMATE HAS NOT BEEN AT 
TIMES PARTS OF THE LAND ARE AS 
FAR NORTH AS ANCHORAGE IN ALASKA 
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE TEMPERATURE YOU 
GET THIS THESE PARTS THERE IS WIND 
UP TO ONE HUNDRED MILES PER HOUR IS NOT 
UNCOMMON TREES FIND IT HARD TO 
GROW YOU HARDLY SEE ANY AT ALL 
ROSA STEPPANOVA SET UP LEA BOTANIC 
GARDENS HERE SHE HAS BEEN 
FANTASTIC IN HELPING ME ARE 
WINTERS HARSH 
IT IS COLD BECAUSE 
OF THE WIND CHILL FACTOR IN 
SHETLAND THERE IS NOWHERE FURTHER 
AWAY FROM THE SEA THAN FIVE 
KILOMETRES WE HAVE A MILD MARITIME 
CLIMATE WE GET NINETEEN HOURS OF 
DAYLIGHT DURING THE SUMMER IN JUNE 
SOMETIMES ON A CLEAR NIGHT YOU 
COULD SIT OUTSIDE AT MIDNIGHT AND 
READ A BOOK AND THE PLANTS 
OBVIOUSLY BENEFIT THEY CAN 
PHOTOSYNTHESISE PHOTOSYNTHESISE CROFTERS WOULD NOT HAVE HAD LOT 
OF FLOWERS 
NO GARDENING TOOK OFF 
IN THE SEVENTIES WITH THE OIL BEFORE 
THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MAINLY 
EDIBLE THERE WOULD BE VN SHETLAND 
KALE MAYBE SOME CARROTS PERHAPS 
THE WILLOW TO GIVE SHELTER THIS IS THE 
REAL THING THIS IS THE REAL THING THIS IS SHETLAND KALE 
YARD THIS IS SEAWEED READY TO BE 
SPREAD YOU HAVE YOUR RHUBARB THERE 
AND THE DAFFODILS AND LOVELY OLD 
SYCAMORE AND THERE'S THE BLUEBELLS 
COMING OUT THIS IS AS TRADITIONAL 
AS IT GETS 
IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE 
BEFORE I GO IT'S FANTASTIC COMING BACK HERE TO SHETLAND HAS 
BEEN REALLY FANTASTIC FOR ME JUST 
SEEING THE LANDSCAPE WHICH IS 
DIFFERENT TO ANYTHING ELSE I THINK 
I'VE EVER COME ACROSS OR SEEN 
BEFORE IT'S JUST GOT A BEAUTY ALL 
OF ITS OWN WELL SUE I SHOULD THINK NOW THERE 
ARE TWO DIRECT FLIGHTS FROM 
STANSTED AIRPORT TO SHETLAND IN THE 
SUMMER MONTHS BETWEEN 
AND 
SUMMER MONTHS BETWEEN MAY AND SEPTEMBER EVERY WEEK L. SHOULD 
THINK YOU'RE ANXIOUS PEOPLE SHOULD 
GO AND LOOK AT IT FOR THEMSELVES 
NOW AREN'T YOU 
ABSOLUTELY AND SEE 
PART OF THE BRITISH ISLES THAT 
MAYBE MANY PEOPLE HAVEN'T SEEN OR 
KNOW ABOUT 
SOME OF THE WATER IS 
TURQUOISE IT'S LIKE THE CARIBBEAN 
I HAVE BEEN UP THERE 
THAT'S RIGHT 
IT JUST MAKES THE PLACE LOOK SO 
BEAUTIFUL ONCE THE WITH THE BLUE 
SKY AND WATER REFLECT IN IT THEY THEY PROBABLY ONLY HAVE THREE HOURS 
DAYLIGHT A DAY WHAT ARE CONDITIONS 
LIKE IN TERMS OF GARDENING YOUR 
STUFF HAS TO BE VERY TOUGH THE THE MAIN THING IS THE STRONG SALT WINDS 
ALTHOUGH THEY DON'T SUFFER BADLY 
FROM FROST IN THE WINTER THEY 
HAVE QUITE MILD WINTERS AND WET 
SUMMERS THE PLANTS DO STRUGGLE 
REALLY I SUPPOSE WITH THE 
DAYLIGHT AS WELL SO ALL OF THE 
CONDITIONS ALTOGETHER ARE REALLY 
AS YOU SAY THOSE SALT LADEN WINDS 
BECAUSE IT'S GENERALLY QUITE BREEZY 
UP THERE 
VERY BREEZY YES THEY 
HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO HAVE GALES OF UP 
TO TWO HUNDRED M. P. H. AT TIMES 
NOT IN SUMMER 
NO 
MARTIN THIS GARDEN HAS BEEN NO DONE TO HIGHLIGHT MOTOR NEURONE 
DISEASE DISEASE YOU'RE HOPING IT 
WILL BE EFFECTIVE 
I HOPE SO FOR 
ALL THOSE FOLK AT HOME THAT HAVE 
M. N. D. THIS IS FOR YOU AND HOPEFULLY 
INCREASE AWARENESS 
IT'S A 
WONDERFUL PLACE TO COME AND ENJOY 
IT'S AN AMAZING LITTLE CROFT THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
THANK YOU 
MANY OF THE FOREIGN EXIBERS AT 
CHELSEA HAVE ESTABLISHED THEIR OWN 
COUNTRIES' HORTICULTURAL SOCIETIES 
HERE AND JAMAICA IS ONE OF THEM 
THIS IS THE FOURTH YEAR JAMAICA HAS 
SHOWN IN THE GREAT PAVILION WE'LL 
BE REPORTING TOMORROW ON THE 
ISLAND'S QUEST TO WIN ITS FIRST 
EVER GOLD MEDAL BUT BRITAIN'S 
HISTORY AND THAT OF JAMAICA HAVE 
BEEN LINKED FOR CENTURIES BY A 
PASSION FOR PLANTS BOTH FOR THE 
COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION AND THE 
DIVERSITY THE LAND HAS TO OFFER 
ITS PLANTS ARE THE VERY REASON THAT 
THE BRITISH SET UP COLONY THERE 
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO AND PLANTS HAVE 
SHAPED ITS HISTORY EVER SINCE 
WESLEY KERR REPORTS JAMAICA HAS NEVER BEEN CONNECTED TO 
ANY OTHER LAND MASS IT BOASTS A 
THOUSAND ENDEMIC PLANT SPECIES 
INCLUDING TWO HUNDRED SPECIES OF ORCHID 
THIS IS AN ISLAND OF ABUNDANCE BEFORE EUROPEANS FIRST MADE CONTACT 
WITH THE INDIGENOUS INDIANS THIS 
ISLAND WAS ALREADY KNOWN AS JAMAICA 
WORD MEANING LAND OF WOOD AND 
WATER FOR MOST OF THE FIVE 
CENTURIES SINCE MUCH OF JAMAICA'S 
WEALTH HAS COME FROM THE PLANTS 
THAT GROW HERE JAMAICA BECAME THE 
MOST VALUABLE COLONY IN THE BRITISH 
EMPIRE THANKS TO CANE SUGAR 
WEALTH FROM SUGAR FUNDED MANY 
FORTUNES BACK IN BRITAIN AND THE 
INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION RUM 
DISTILLED FROM CANE FIRED UP THE 
ROYAL NAVY MY ANCESTORS TOILED IN 
JAMAICA'S CANE FIELDS AND SUGAR 
PLANTATIONS LIKE THIS ONE WHICH IS 
STILL MASS PRODUCING SUGAR TO THIS 
DAY CAPTURED FROM SPAIN IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE 
THE COLONY WAS UNDERPINNED BY SLAVE 
LABOUR IT WAS ALSO A PLACE FOR 
YOUNG FREEMEN ON THE MAKE LIKE THE 
IRISH NATURALIST AND PHYSICIAN HANS 
SLOAN HE ARRIVED HERE IN 
SPANISHTOWN IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN AS THE 
GOVERNOR'S DOCTOR THROUGH HIM THE 
PLANTS OF THIS ISLAND WERE TO HAVE 
A PROFOUND EFFECT ON BRITISH 
HORTICULTURE AND WORLD CUISINE IN 
ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVEN HIS NATURAL HISTORY OF JAMAICA 
WAS PUBLISHED IT'S AN ASTONISHING 
RECORD OF JAMAICA'S PEOPLE AND 
PLANTS THIS IS HIS MAP 
YES IT IS 
SO WHAT'S HERE A VOYAGE TO JAMAICA 
WITH NATURAL HISTORY OF THE HERBS 
AND TREES AND FOUR FOOTED BEASTS 
AND FISHES AS A JAMAICAN BOTANIST 
HOW USEFUL IS IT TO KNOW ALL OF 
THIS WORK WAS DONE OVER THREE HUNDRED YEARS 
AGO HERE 
IT'S FEM NOMINAL BECAUSE 
IT MAPS THE HISTORY AS IT WAS BACK 
THEN YOU HAVE THIS AS A REFERENCE 
TO READ LOOK BACK AT THESE 
ACCOUNTS AND SEE WHAT CHANGES HAVE 
HAPPENED BETWEEN THEN AND NOW 
AMONG HIS MANY ACHIEVEMENTS HANS 
SLOAN HAS LONG BEEN CREDITED WITH 
THE INVENTION OF MILK CHOCOLATE 
BUT HIS BOOK SUGGESTS HE MAY HAVE 
GOT THE IDEA FROM THE JAMAICANS 
CHOCOLATE IS HERE USED BY PEOPLE 
AT ALL TIMES BUT CHIEFLY IN THE 
MORNING MIXED WITH EGGS FOUND IT 
IN GREAT QUANTITIES NAUSEOUS 
THOUGH CHILDREN DRINK IT HERE IN 
QUANTITIES LIKE IN ENGLAND THEY 
FEED ON MILK 
HE TOOK THE RECIPE HOME TO ENGLAND 
SOON MANY APOTHECARYS WERE 
MANUFACTURING MEDICINE KNOWN AS 
SOHAN SLOAN'S MILK IT WAS THIS 
RECIPE THAT WAS LATER USED BY 
CADBURY IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IT 
WASN'T JUST JAMAICA GIVING PLANTS 
TO THE WORLD BUT THE PLANTS THAT 
HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO JAMAICA THAT 
HAVE FORMED KEY PART OF THIS 
ISLAND'S HISTORY PORT ROYAL BECAME 
A SAFE HAVEN FOR PIRATES IN RETURN 
THE PIRATES GAVE BRITISH SHIPS SAFE 
PASSAGE THROUGH THE RIB CARIBBEAN 
AND IT WAS HERE THAT CAPTAIN 
WILLIAM BLIE LANDED IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY THREE SEVEN 
YEARS EARLIER BLIE HAD BEEN 
APPOINTED BY THE ADMIRALTY TO GO TO 
TAHITI ABOARD H. M. S. BOUNTY TO COLLECT 
BREAD FRUIT TREES THE INTENTION 
WAS TO BRING THEM TO THE WEST 
INDIES AS A CHEAP YEAR AROUND 
SOURCE OF FOOD FOR THE SLAVES BUT 
EN ROUTE TO JAMAICA THE BOUNTY 
CREW MUTINIED CASTING BLIE AND EIGHTEEN 
LOYAL SAILORS ADRIFT IN THE PACIFIC 
IT'S THOUGHT HE'D USED A 
DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF THE 
WATER AVAILABLE NOT TO SLAKE THE 
CREW'S THIRST BUT DO WATER THE 
PLANTS HIS SECOND JOURNEY WAS 
SUCCESS ON THE SOUTH EAST OF THE 
ISLAND IS BATH WHERE HIS BREAD 
FRUIT TREES WERE FIRST PLANTED 
TODAY IT'S HOME TO THE SECOND 
OLDEST BOTANICAL GARDEN IN THE 
WESTERN HEMISPHERE ESTABLISHED IN 
ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE TODAY IT GROWS PROLIFICICALLY 
ALL OVER THE ISLAND BUT HERE YOU 
CAN STILL SEE THE DIRECT 
DESCENDANTS OF THOSE TWO THOUSAND TREES 
THAT HE BROUGHT ON THAT HISTORIC 
SECOND EXPEDITION 
THE BREAD FRUIT WAS BOILED ROAST 
BAKED AND EVEN IN SOME CASES 
FRIED AND AFTER SLAVERY WHAT 
HAPPENED IT BECAME A BEDROCK IN 
THE JAMAICAN SOCIETY THERE WAS A 
LOT OF EXPORTS TO PLACES LIKE THE 
U. K. CANADA THE UNITED STATES AND 
JUST ABOUT EVERY COUNTRY WHERE YOU 
FIND MIGRANT POPULATIONS 
SO IT 
REALLY WAS A GREAT GIFT TO JAMAICA 
IT WAS A REAL GIFT INDEED AMONG AMONG THE PLANT SAMPLES BLIE TOOK BACK TO 
LONDON WAS THIS JAMAICA'S 
NATIONAL FRUIT THE ACCHI IN FACT 
IT'S A WEST AFRICAN FRUIT BROUGHT 
TO JAMAICA BY SLAVES AND LATER 
GIVEN A LATIN NAME IN HONOUR OF 
CAPTAIN BLIE NOT A NOVELTY EXOTIC 
BUT A MARK OF THE FACT THE 
HORTICULTURAL HISTORIES OF JAMAICA 
AND THE U. K. ARE INEXTRICABLY 
INTERTWINED TOMORROW WE'LL BE MEETING THE 
LADIES OF THE JAMAICAN 
HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY BUT THEIR 
EXOTIC BLOOMS ONLY ARRIVED BY PLANE 
VIA KINGSTON ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO 
SO I AM NOT GOING TO INTERRUPT THEM 
NOW WHAT THEY'LL BE WORKING 
SOLIDLY UNTIL THEY FINISH TOON IN 
THE CENTRE THERE A BIRD OF PARADISE 
FLOWER AND BANKS AND BANKS OF 
ORCHIDS AND AND FURIUMS DOWN AROUND 
THE FRONT QUITE WONDERFUL THERE 
IS ADDED PRESSURE FOR THE JAMAICAN 
EXHIBITORS THIS YEAR THEY'RE NOT 
ONLY PREPARING FOR THE R. H. S. JUDGES 
BUT FOR A VISIT FROM THE JAMAICAN 
PRIME MINISTER AND THEY'RE HOPING 
HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN GOOD LUCK 
LADIES MORE AND MORE OF US ARE LIVING IN 
CROWDED TOWNS AND CITIES BUT WE 
STILL HANKER AFTER OUR OWN BIT OF 
GREEN SPACE THIS YEAR THERE ARE TWELVE 
GARDENS THAT COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS 
TO LIMITED AND OFTEN AWKWARD SPACES 
THIS ONE IS CALLED THE CHILDREN'S 
SOCIETY GARDEN IT'S BY MARK 
GREGORY A SEASONED PROFESSIONAL 
HE'S DESIGNED TO MANY GARDENS AT 
CHELSEA BUT HE'S DESIGNED AND 
BUILT THIS ONE YOU CAN SEE THE 
FINISHING IS PERFECT LOADS OF 
PLANTS IN THERE A FANTASTIC 
SOLUTION TO A FRONT GARDEN YOU CAN 
EVEN GET YOUR BIKES IN THERE AS 
WELL THIS ONE I REALLY LIKE THE 
RECESS GARDEN YOU HAVE THE TIMBER 
WALLS AND THE RUSTY STEEL AT THE 
BACK AND THE SILVER BIRCHES COMING 
THROUGH THE WHOLE THING IS SUNKEN 
YOU DON'T WANT TO HIT A WATER TABLE 
AROUND HERE THIS IS A CLASSIC 
CONTEMPORARY GARDEN LOADS OF TREE 
FERNS ACROSS THAT WHITE BACKDROP 
IT'S AGAIN SUNKEN QUITE A LOT 
OF SUNKEN GARDENS TO GET THAT DEPTH 
SO THE CROWDS CAN LOOK INTO IT 
WE'RE COMING AROUND TO RACHEL'S 
GARDEN I KNOW SHE'S A BIT PANICKY 
THIS IS THE L. K. BENNETT GARDEN THEY 
HAVE ONLY JUST FINISHED 
CONSTRUCTION THESE JACKETS ARE 
EVERYWHERE PEOPLE STILL BUILDING 
AND THERE'S RACHEL AT THE BACK 
THERE PUTTING SOME PLANTS IN YEAH 
I HOPE SHE FINISHES 
AND DOWN IN THE TRIANGLE THERE'S 
ANOTHER SIX URBAN GARDENSS ALL BACK 
TO BACK PRETTY MUCH SO YOU CAN WALK 
AROUND THEM THIS ONE IS CALL GREEN 
LIVING AND IT'S GOT GREEN WALLS 
AND ROOFS THERE'S A LOT OF THIS 
GOING ON IN THE CITY BECAUSE IT 
GREENS UP THE CITY OBVIOUSLY BUT 
ALSO IT INCREASES BIODIVERSITY AND 
CAN COOL UP THE CITY IF WE GET 
ENOUGH OF THOSE IN AS WELL THIS IS 
A FRONT GARDEN AS WELL HERE IT'S 
ALL ABOUT RAINWATER HARVESTING 
THIS GARDEN SO ALL THE WATER FROM 
THE ROOF CAN GO ON TO THE GROUND TO 
A TANK UNDERNEATH SO IT CAN BE 
RECYCLED SOMETHING WE'RE ALL 
CONSCIOUS OF THESE DAYS THIS IS A 
ROOF GARDEN IT'S FOR AN ASTRONOMER 
WHO BASICALLY LOVES LOOKING AT THE 
STARS AT NIGHT THERE YOU GO A 
FANTASTIC VIEW THROUGH THE MIDDLE 
THERE THERE IS GOING TO BE A 
TELESCOPE PLACED RIGHT ON THERE ON 
THAT PODIUM JUST WAITING 
A REALLY INTERESTING GARDEN THE 
FINISHING TOUCHES GOING ON IN THERE 
LOOK AT THIS THIS IS FANTASTIC 
THIS IS CALLED THE GREEN DOOR AND 
HE USES THESE TRADEMARK MOSSY WALLS 
WHICH ARE FANTASTIC THEY'RE SO 
TACT I'LL WE HAVE A GUY OVER THERE 
SPRAYING AWAY SOAKING THEM 
PROBABLY HAVING TO DO THAT EVERY 
HOUR OR SO AT MOMENT A REALLY 
BEAUTIFUL GARDEN ONE ANOTHER ONE 
ENCOURAGING BIODIVERSITY AND 
WILDLIFE INTO THE GARDEN AND THIS 
IS THE LAST ONE THE QUILTED 
VELVET GARDEN INSPIRED BY THE 
ARTIST WHO SORT OF GOES UPSTAIRS 
AND DOWNSTAIRS IT'S ONE OF THOSE 
CLASSIC OUTDOOR ROOMS SOMEWHERE 
TO RELAX 
WELL THE LUCKY ONES LIKE LEEDS 
CITY COUNCIL ARE FINISHED THAT 
MEANS THEIR PLANTS HAVE A CHANCE TO 
BREATHE AND PERK UP OVERNIGHT BUT 
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF BURNING OF 
THE MIDNIGHT OIL TO GET THINGS IN 
AND GET THINGS GOING BECAUSE BY 
EIGHT POINT OH OH TOMORROW IT'S ALL GOT TO BE 
DONE AND DUSTED HASN'T IT 
I KNOW 
GOT TO BE A FEW LIGHTS OUT L. AM 
ACTUALLY SURPRISED HOW CALM IT 
FEELS AROUND HERE EVERYONE SEEMS 
IN CONTROL 
THEY DO THERE'S FEW 
LATE COMERS THOUGH GETTING THINGS 
GOING 
THERE'S A RENEWED KIND OF ENERGY IN 
TERMS OF DESIGN SOMETHING HAS 
HAPPENED IN THESE LAST TWELVE MONTHS 
WHICH HAS CHANGED THE OVERALL 
FORWARD VIEW OF GARDEN DESIGN IT 
SEEMS TO ME 
YES IT'S A HIGH 
QUALITY OF DESIGN BUT ALSO 
DIVERSITY DESIGN BEING APPLIED TO 
DIFFERENT TYPES AND STYLES OF 
GARDENS SOME PEOPLE DIGGING DOWN 
SOME BUILDING UPS BUT THERE IS 
HIGH END DESIGN HERE 
I HAVE NEVER 
SEEN PEOPLE GO DOWN AS FAR THAT'S 
A FIRST THERE'S A SUBBASEMENT 
SOMEWHERE OVER THERE 
THERE'S A 
TUBE STATION 
THAT'S WHY THE 
AUSTRALIANS HAVE COME STRAIGHT UP 
OUT OF THE HOLE REALLY AREN'T 
THEY DO YOU AS A DESIGNER LEARN 
THINGS HERE 
EVERY TIME THERE'S A 
LOT OF GREENERY HERE YOU SEE AND 
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST 
SHOWING HOW SIMPLE AND HOW GREEN 
CAN BE SO CALMING IN A GARDEN 
THERE'S A LOT OF GREEN THIS YEAR 
IT'S INTERESTING THE DIFFERENCE 
THIS YEAR WITH THE GREEN MAYBE AN 
INJECTION OF COLOUR RED AND YELLOW 
THAT MIGHT JUST HAPPEN AFTER THIS 
YEAR THE NICE YEARS OVER YOU 
KNOW THAT'S ALL TODAY HAS ONLY 
BEEN A TASTE OF WHAT'S TO COME THE 
REAL SHOW STARTS TOMORROW WHEN THE 
CURTAIN GOES UP ON THE WORLD'S 
PREMIER FLOWER SHOW 
NICKI WILL BE BACK WITH ALL THE 
GLITZ AND GLAMOUR OF PRESS DAY AND AND JOE AND I WILL BE BACK AT SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY ALSO

THE FIRST OFFICIAL DAY OF THE R. H. S. 
CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FROM WHAT 
WE'VE SEEN TODAY I THINK WE'VE GOT 
A LOT TO LOOK FORWARD TO AND YOU 
MIGHT THINK WE'VE SEEN MOST OF IT 
WE BARELY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE SO 
UNTIL TOMORROW FROM JOE AND FROM 
ME BYE BYE BYE BYE HOPES
