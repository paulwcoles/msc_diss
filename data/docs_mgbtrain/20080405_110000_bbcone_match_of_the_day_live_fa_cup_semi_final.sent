ASTON VILLA DAVID NUGENT GIVES

PORTSMOUTH CELEBRATE MELLOR 
PORTSMOUTH INTO THE F. A. CUP SEMI 
FINAL 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO WEMBLEY WHERE 
BOTH F. A. CUP SEMI FINALS SPONSORED 
BY YON WILL BE PLAYED THIS YEAR 
AND WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EITHER 
PORTSMOUTH OR WEST BROM TONIGHT 
THEY RETURN TO WEMBLEY AND COULD 
WIN THE CUP ITSELF SOMETHING EVEN 
SOME OF THE GREATS OF THE GAMES 
HAVE NOT MANAGED TO ACHIEVE 
ALONGSIDE ALAN SHEARER IS ALAN 
HANSEN AND LEE DIXON IT IS 
REFRESHING THE F. A. CUP THIS YEAR 
NORMALLY WE ARE USED TO SEEING THE 
BIG FOUR IN THE SEMI FINALS 
IT IS 
A CHANGE IT HAS BEEN REFRESHING 
FOR THE SMALLER CLUBS 
TO COME 
FOR THE SMALLER CLUBS TO COME THROUGH EVERYBODY TALKS TO SAYS 
THE GREAT CHANCE FOR PORTSMOUTH AND 
WEST BROM AS WELL A ONCE IN A 
LIFETIME CHANCE FOR THE PLAYERS TO 
PLAY IN AN F. A. CUP FINAL WHICH IS 
STILL A GREAT DAY FOR EVERYONE YOU 
WOULD SAY PORTSMOUTH ARE THE 
FAVOURITES HARRY REDKNAPP FOR ME 
AS A REMARKABLE JOB HIS TEAM OF 
PLAYERS ARE EXCELLENT STRONG IN 
DEFENCE UP FRONT CREATIVITY AND 
PACE KANU AND MILAN BAROS THEY 
ARE OBVIOUSLY FAVOURITE BUT A GREAT 
CHANCE FOR WEST BROM GENUINE GENUINE BELIEF FOR BOTH SETS OF SUPPORTERS 
ALAN THAT THEY COULD MAKE IT TO 
THE FINAL IT IS ONE HUNDRED YEARS SINCE IT 
HAPPENED 
ABSOLUTELY L. CAN'T HAPPENED REMEMBER A YEAR LIKE THIS TIME 
AFTER TIME WE HAVE GONE FOR THE 
FAVOURITE EVERY TIME AND WE HAVE 
BEEN AT THE GROUNDS OVER THE PAST 
FEW MONTHS AND IT JUST HASN'T 
HAPPENED FOR THEM L. THINK IT GIVES 
EVERYONE ELSE HOPE FOR NEXT SEASON 
THEY WILL SAY THESE TEAMS HAVE 
DONE IT WHY CAN'T WE YOU WILL GET 
TEAMS UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY THIS 
YEAR KICKING THEMSELVES SAYING 
THAT SHOULD BE US IN THE SEMI FINAL 
A GREAT DAY OUT FOR BOTH SETS OF 
SUPPORTERS 
GREATER FOR SUPPORTERS SUPPORTERS APART FROM ADRIAN TRIALS WHO WAS 
VERY NERVOUS OUT THERE GREAT 
FOOTBALLING SIDE WEST BROM THEY 
WILL PASS THE BALL ALL OVER THE 
PITCH SO I THINK THEY HAVE GOT A 
CHANCE BUT I THINK MY PORTSMOUTH 
COULD BE TOO STRONG IN MIDFIELD 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT IT'S 
GREAT FOR A DAY OUT ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY SOME PEOPLE SAY IT DEVALUES THE 
FINAL BUT TELL THOSE SUPPORTERS 
OUT THERE L. THINK IT'S FANTASTIC 
BUSTLE OF THE SUPPORTERS COME HERE 
IT'S A GREAT DAY OF SPORT TODAY ON 
THE B. B. C. AINTREE ARE PREPARING TO 
STAGE THE GRAND NATIONAL IF THE 
BIG RACE FOLLOWS FOOTBALL'S EXAMPLE 
THIS YEAR THEN GET YOUR MONEY ON 
RANK OUTSIDER A TWO HORSE RACE AT 
WEMBLEY TODAY LET'S HEAR FROM TONY OF THEIR STRENGTH SIZE AND 
AWARE OF THEIR STRENGTH SIZE AND TALENT ATHLETICISM IT'S A BIG ASK 
FOR AS BUT ONE WE LOOK FORWARD TO 
AND GENUINELY BELIEVE WE HAVE GOT 
GOOD CHANCE 
THE TROOPS FIT AND 
WELL 
I THINK SO IF THEY ARE NOT WELL READY BY NOW FOR WEMBLEY YOU'RE 
NEVER READY SO WE WILL GIVE IT OUR 
BEST SHOT 
AFTER LAST YEAR'S VISIT 
TO WEMBLEY WHICH ENDED SO 
DISAPPOINTINGLY WHAT IS THE DESIRE 
IN THE DRESSING ROOM TO PUT THAT 
RIGHT 
I THINK IT HAS LITTLE RIGHT BEARING ON TODAY IT WAS 
DISAPPOINTING FOR US BUT IT MAY 
HELP US THE FACT THAT THE PLAYERS 
HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE THEY HAVE 
BEEN AROUND THE STADIUM THAT HELPS 
SOMETIMES ON A DAY WHEN YOU ARE NOT 
SORT OF AWESTRUCK BY THE SHEER SIZE 
OF THE PLACE HOPEFULLY WE WILL GET 
THE BENEFIT OF THAT 
IT HAS BEEN AN 
UNUSUAL F. A. CUP AND MAYBE THERE IS 
ANOTHER TWIST OR TURN YET GOOD 
LUCK 
WE HOPE SO 
YOU HAVE HAD SOME LUCK INJURIES WHAT IS THE NEWS IT'S IT'S NOT TOO BAD HERMANN HREIDARSSON 
HAD A PROBLEM WITH HIS ACHILLES 
HEEL BUT NOW IT'S FIXED WE ARE 
CROAKY BUT WE ARE O. K. BUTTERFLIES BUTTERFLIES IN THE STOMACH 
NO EVERYONE IS 
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE GAME WE 
WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN GO ALL THE 
WAY AND WIN THE CUP WE HAVE GOT 
THE OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE GOT A LOT 
OF EXPERIENCED PLAYERS COMING TO 
WEMBLEY IS NOTHING NEW FOR THEM 
MANAGERS LIKE THE UNDERDOGS BUT YOU 
ARE STRONG FAVOURITES HERE DO YOU 
SIT COMFORTABLY WITH THAT 
TO BE 
HONEST YOU WOULD RATHER BE IN THAT 
SITUATION YOU COME IN HERE WITH 
CHELSEA WHATEVER WHEN WE BEAT 
MANCHESTER UNITED AT OLD TRAFFORD 
I GOT BACK ON THE COACH AND 
EVERYBODY SAID WHO DO YOU WANT TO 
PLAY L. DID NOT WANT TO PLAY 
CHELSEA AS IT TURNED OUT IT WAS 
ONLY WEST BROM WHO GOT THROUGH 
EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE 
MANCHESTER UNITED CHELSEA 
MIDDLESBROUGH THEY ALL FELL BY THE 
WAYSIDE YES WE ARE THE ONLY 
PREMIER LEAGUE CLUB LEFT IN BUT I 
WOULD MUCH RATHER BE IN THAT 
SITUATION HAVING MANCHESTER UNITED 
AND CHELSEA IN IT 
AFTER MANCHESTER 
UNITED THERE MUST BE TREMENDOUS 
CONFIDENCE 
YES BUT WE KNOW IT CONFIDENCE WILL BE TOUGH TODAY WEST BROM HAVE 
GOOD PLAYERS WE HAVE SEEN AN AWFUL 
LOT OF THEM L. KNOW THEIR PLAYERS 
THEY PASS THE BALL GREAT IT WILL 
BE A TOUGH GAME TODAY IT WAS TOUGH 
AGAINST PLYMOUTH AND PRESTON SO WE 
KNOW HOW TOUGH THIS WILL BE WE 
HAVE GOT TO BE AT OUR BEST TODAY 
BEST OF LUCK 
DAMIAN JOHN SON 
TALKING TO HARRY REDKNAPP HIS 
FIRST VISIT TO WEMBLEY AS A MANAGER 
IT'S INCREDIBLE LOOKING AT HIS 
EXPERIENCE IN HIS CAREER TO BE 
HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME IT'S 
INCREDIBLE RIGHTLY SO THEY ARE 
FAVOURITES L. THINK THEY MIGHT HAVE 
A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH FOR WEST BROM 
BUT HOW DO WE KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING 
TO GO WEST BROM CAN SCORE GOALS 
THEY ARE THE TOP SCORERS IN ALL THE 
LEAKS BUT ARE THEY ARE UP AGAINST 
SOME REAL CENTRE HALVES ARE TODAY 
CAMPBELL AND SYLVAIN DISTIN IT MAY 
BE TOO HARD FOR THEM 
I THINK THIS 
SEPARATES THE GOOD MANAGERS FROM 
THE GREAT MANAGERS IF YOU THINK 
YOU HAVE WON THE GAME BEFORE YOU GO 
ON THE PITCH YOU ARE IN TROUBLE 
HARRY REDKNAPP WILL BE EMPHASISING 
THE NEED NOT TO BE COMPLACENT 
DON'T TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED 
YOU HAVE GOT TO WIN THE GAME START 
QUICKLY 
HE HAS PUT TOGETHER A QUICKLY STRONG SIDE AT PORTSMOUTH 
HE HAS 
IF HE KEEPS HIS BACK FOUR SOLID 
BECAUSE WEST BROM CAN SCORE GOALS 
FROM MIDFIELD AND WITH PHILLIPS UP 
FRONT THEY HAVE GOT A CHANCE L. 
THINK WEST BROM ARE'S ONLY CHANCE 
OF GETTING THROUGH IS IF THEY 
ATTACK IF THEY SIT BACK 
PORTSMOUTH WILL BE TOO STRONG FOR 
THEM THEY ARE NOT SO GOOD AT 
DEFENDING 
NEITHER TEAM WILL EVER DEFENDING HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF WINNING 
THIS COMPETITION EVER 
THE GREAT 
THING ABOUT THE F. A. CUP THIS SEASON 
IS THAT THE UNDERDOGS HAVE WON 
EVERY TIME WHO ARE WE GOING FOR 
THAT'S MY QUESTION PORTSMOUTH PORTSMOUTH THAT THREE OF US I'M GOING FOR 
WEST BROM I'M GOING FOR WEST BROM 
YOU CAN'T SAY PORTSMOUTH BY GOING 
TO BE TOO STRONG FOR THEM AND THEN 
GO FOR WEST BROM 
I CAN HAVE I'M I'M GOING WITH PORTSMOUTH 
IT COULD GO 
TO EXTRA TIME AND PENALTIES NO 
REPLAYS AT THIS STAGE OF THE 
COMPETITION PORTSMOUTH AGAINST 
WEST BROMWICH ALBION OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS FOR A PLACE IN THE 
FINAL OF THE F. A. CUP THE GAME IS 
AVAILABLE IN HIGH DEFINITION 
SWITCH TO B. B. C. H. T. IF YOU HAVE THAT 
CAPABILITY MARK LAWRENSON AND JOHN 
MOTSON OF COMMENTATORS OF THE 
COMMENTATORS IT IS NICE WEATHER 
HERE TODAY IT HAS BEEN WELL 
DOCUMENTED THEY WON THE F. A. CUP IN 
NINETEEN THIRTY NINE AND KEPT THE TROPHY FOR SEVEN 
YEARS THE LAST TIME BEFORE THE WAR 
THEY DID PLAY HERE AT WEMBLEY THREE 
YEARS LATER IN WHAT WAS KNOWN AS 
THE LONDON WAR CUP FINAL I'M NOT 
OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THAT AND 
NEITHER ARE THEY THEY LOST A TWO TO OH TWO 
BRENTFORD IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO AND THAT WAS THE 
LAST TIME THEIR COLOURS CAME TO THE 
STADIUM WHEN PORTSMOUTH LAST REACH 
THE SEMI FINAL IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO EVEN THOUGH 
WEMBLEY HAD STAGED GAMES OF THE 
YEAR BEFORE AND BE A RAFTER 
PORTSMOUTH MET LIVERPOOL AT 
HIGHBURY DARREN ANDERTON'S GOAL 
LOOKED LIKE WINNING THE GAME AND 
SETTING UP FOR THE FINAL UNTIL 
RONNIE WHELAN ARE RESCUED LIVERPOOL 
WHO GOT THE REPLAY AT VILLA PARK ON 
PENALTY AFTER EXTRA TIME ALBION 
ARE IN THE STRIPES AND THEY HAVE 
HAD HIGHBURY HEARTBREAKS IN SEMI 
FINALS THEY LOST TO IPSWICH IN 
NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND QUEENS PARK RANGERS IN THE 
NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THEIR OVERALL RECORD OF TWENTY F. A. 
CUP SEMI FINALS IS ONLY BETTERED BY 
ARSENAL MANCHESTER UNITED 
LIVERPOOL AND EVERTON SO PLAY AT 
POMPEY WILL BE THE CRY FROM ONE END 
AND THE 
WILL BE AT THE 
OTHER END WELL SUPPORTED BOTH 
CLUBS THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND TICKETS EACH FOR THE 
TWO SUPPORTING SEMI FINALISTS HERE 
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THE GAME I I THINK THE ATMOSPHERE IS RATHER 
SPECIAL BECAUSE IT'S NOT TWO OF THE 
BIGGER TEAMS AS IT WERE EVERYONE 
HAS BEEN HERE VERY EARLY 
DETERMINED TO ENJOY THEMSELVES THE 
PICTURE LOOKS VERY GOOD A GREAT 
STADIUM A GREAT REFEREE THE 
ROMANCE OF THE F. A. CUP IS BACK ON 
IT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN THE YEAR OF 
THE UNDERDOG A REFRESHING CHANGE 
LET'S JUST SEE WHAT KIND OF DISPLAY 
THEY CAN PUT ON AS WE LOOK AT THE 
TEAM USED NOW WE LOOK AT THE TEAM NEWS NOW TONY MOWBRAY HAS LEFT ISHMAEL 
MILLER ON THE BENCH ALONGSIDE 
CHRIS BRANT HARRY REDKNAPP THE FIRST TIME HE 
HAS REACHED THIS STAGE OF THE F. A. 
CUP AS PLAYER OR MANAGER HE IS 
SIXTY ONE NOW WITH HIM ON THAT BENCH WILL 
BE TONY ADAMS CAPTAIN OF ARSENAL 
WHO LIFTED THE F. A. CUP THREE TIMES 
ALSO SUPPORTED BY JOE JORDAN WHO 
PLAYED FOR MANCHESTER UNITED IN THE 
FINAL AND PAUL GROVES WHO HAS BEEN 
DOING SOME USEFUL WORK ON THE 
TRAINING GROUND THERE ON THE 
ALBION BENCH MEMORIES OF TONY 
MOWBRAY BECAUSE HIS LAST GAME HERE 
WAS IN A WEMBLEY PLAY OFF FOR 
IPSWICH I CAN SEE JOE CORRIGAN 
THERE THERE IS TONY MOWBRAY HE 
DIDN'T PLAY AGAIN FOR IPSWICH BUT 
HE TOOK HIBERNIAN TO TWO SCOTTISH 
CUP SEMI FINALS HE WAS BEATEN IN 
BOTH AND WILL BE HOPING FOR BETTER 
LUCK TODAY IT'S ALL SET HERE MARK 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU FEEL THAT 
PORTSMOUTH'S PREMIERSHIP QUALITY IS 
GOING TO AFFECT MILAN BAROS AFTER 
ALL TOP SCORER IN EURO TWO THOUSAND FOUR I KNOW THAT THE CHAMPIONSHIP CAN BE 
QUITE PHYSICAL BUT PORTSMOUTH ARE 
VERY PHYSICAL TEAM SOMETHING THAT 
WEST BROM ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL 
WITH 
THERE IS ONE THING THEY WILL WITH HAVE TO DEAL WITH BETTER THEY ARE 
VULNERABLE AT SET PLAYS L. L. HAVE 
SEEN GOALS FROM CORNERS AND FREE 
KICKS AND PORTSMOUTH ARE ONE OF THE 
TOURIST TEAMS IN THE COUNTRY 
SOMETHING THEY WILL HAVE TO BE ON 
THEIR GUARD ABOUT TODAY 
A LOT OF 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEAN KIELY A 
FORMER PORTSMOUTH GOALKEEPER HE IS 
THIRTY SEVEN NOW HOWARD WEBBER WHO IS YET 
TO REFEREE A FINAL BUT HE IS IN 
CHARGE OF THIS SEMI FINAL THE SAINT 
REFEREEING A TRIO WHO WILL BE 
REPRESENTING ENGLAND IN AUSTRIA AND 
SWITZERLAND THIS SUMMER THE SAME PORTSMOUTH PLAY FROM RIGHT TO LEFT 
IN THE FIRST HALF YOU WILL 
REMEMBER NIKO KRANJCAR SCORED FOR 
CROATIA AGAINST ENGLAND THEN MAYBE ONE OR TWO OF THESE 
PLAYERS NOT PARTICULARLY WELL KNOWN 
TO YOU THEN MAYBE A FREE KICK 
TO ALBION THE CAPTAIN AND 
PLAYMAKER IT IS JONATHAN GREENING 
THE MIDFIELD ORCHESTRATOR IT IS A PITY ROMAN BEDNAR COULDN'T GET HOLD OF IT TONY MOWBRAY WHO IS CHANGING SEATS I DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO SIT DOWN THE QUESTION IS IS MILAN BAROS 
GOING TO PLAY DOWN THE CHANNELS 
THAT SEEMS TO BE THE PORTSMOUTH 
POLICY PAPA BOUBA DIOP IS PLAYING WIDE RIGHT FOR PORTSMOUTH I THINK THAT IS THREE TIMES THAT 
KEVIN PHILLIPS HAS DROPPED DEEP AND 
PICK THE BALL UP EVERY TIME A LITTLE BIT OF A WORRY FOR WEST 
BROM KANU SEEMED TO WHAT'S THROUGH 
WEST BROMWICH'S DEFENCE THEY KNOW 
ALL ABOUT HIM 
A FORMER WEST BROM 
PLAYER HE SCORED NINE GOALS 
WALKS IT IS A FREE KICK TO ALBION IT WAS MORRISON WHO HAD BEEN FOULED 
I'M LOOKING TO SEE WHO THEY SEND UP 
FOR THIS ALONG WEMBLEY HISTORY BEHIND KEVIN 
PHILLIPS HE PLAYED HERE TEN YEARS 
AGO IN THAT MEMORABLE PLAY OFF 
FINAL FOR SUNDERLAND AGAINST 
CHARLTON 
SYLVAIN DISTIN AND CHARLTON CAMPBELL ARE HAVING A CHAT SAYING 
TILLERS ARE NO DIARRA YOU NEED TO 
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS FELLOW HE 
AND CAMPBELL ARE GOING TO HAVE TO 
GET THAT RESPONSIBILITY THE THE FEELING ABOUT NO PSALMODY ARE IT IS 
THAT HE IS A TERRIFIC FOOTBALLER 
BUT HE COULD DO A BIT MORE WORK 
DEFENSIVELY LAST DIARRA PHILLIPS IS REALLY GETTING INTO THE 
GAME IN THIS OPENING PERIOD IF IF SYLVAIN DISTIN AND CAMPBELL ARE 
GOING TO COME OUT AND NOT HIM THAT 
WILL LEAVE A SPACE BESIDE BOTH OF 
THEM 
ALBION HAVE HAD A TECHNICAL THEM SUCCESS IN THE FIRST TEN MINUTES 
DAVID JAMES NEEDED HELP SOL SOL CAMPBELL WITH THE CLEARANCE 
EVERYTHING IS GOING THROUGH 
PHILLIPS 
A GOOD START BY THE PHILLIPS CHAMPIONSHIP SIDE JAMES DIDN'T LOOK COMFORTABLE WITH 
THAT SHOT 
UNSURPRISED THERE IS NO 
ONE ON THE PORTSMOUTH BENCH SAYING 
WE NEED TO SORT THIS OUT I AM 
SURPRISED SYLVAIN DISTIN CAME OUT AND 
COMMITTED HIMSELF THE REAL PROBLEM 
FOR PORTSMOUTH 
THEY HAVEN'T REALLY 
GOT INTO THEIR STRIDE YET THE 
PREMIERSHIP TEAM MILAN BAROS DID NOT GET THE FIRST TOUCH 
HE JUST CAUGHT WEST BROM A TOUCH BIT SQUARE 
THERE WAS A MIXED VIEW 
ON MILAN BAROS WHEN HE PLAYED FOR 
LIVERPOOL BUT HE HAS GOT 
INTERNATIONAL PEDIGREE THERE IS NO 
DOUBT ABOUT THAT 
HE RAN TOO MANY 
STRAIGHT LINES WHEN HE PLAYED FOR 
LIVERPOOL ZOLTAN GERA TRIED TO GET THAT IN TOWARDS ROMAN BEDNAR THEY JUST CAN'T GET HOLD OF IT PORTSMOUTH 
NOT AT ALL 
A GOOD PORTSMOUTH OPENING BY WEST BROMWICH ALBION HE MUST BE PLEASED WITH THIS 
OPENING TONY MOWBRAY 
I HE 
CERTAINLY IS THE PROBLEM IS THERE 
ARE ANOTHER EIGHTY MINUTES TO COME PORTSMOUTH HAVE A BREAK ON HERE WHICH TEAM PLAYS IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
IT IS NOT THE OPENING THAT LEAGUE WOULD HAVE BEEN PREDICTED WEST 
BROM WERE AT WEMBLEY LAST YEAR IN 
THE PLAY OFF FINAL THEY LOST ONE TO ZERO 
I THINK KANU HAS JUST CAUGHT CARL 
HOEFKENS IN THE CHALLENGE THERE THERE ARE TWO WEST BROM PLAYERS DOWN IS IS IT GREENING THE OTHER ONE BECAUSE 
HE WENT FIFTY TO FIFTY WITH KANU HE CAUGHT 
ONE ON THE KNEE 
HE CAUGHT HIM AS 
HE PLAYED THE BALL 
IT MIGHT GIVE 
PORTSMOUTH A CHANCE THEY ARE 
HAVING A CHAT WITH DIARRA 
THERE IS 
A DEBATE IN THE CENTRE CIRCLE 
BETWEEN THREE OR FOUR PORTSMOUTH 
PLAYERS WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO 
ABOUT PHILLIPS 
DIARRA IS GOING TO 
HAVE TO PICK HIM UP AND BE AWARE OF 
HIM UNTIL PORTSMOUTH GET PLAYING 
HE IS PLAYING WITH A CIGAR AND 
SLIPPERS ON AT THE MOMENT PHILLIPS 
HE IS RUNNING THE GAME THESE TEAMS HAVEN'T MET FOR A 
COUPLE OF SEASONS WEST BROM HAVE 
WON SIX OF THE LAST EIGHT MEETINGS 
ACTUALLY TONY ADAMS SCORED THE 
WINNING GOAL IN THE SEMI FINAL IN 
THE MID NINETIES FOR ARSENAL AGAINST 
TOTTENHAM COME ON HARRY THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SORTED OUT HERE I THINK HE TRIED TO GET SOME SORT OF SIGNAL OUT THERE IT IS SOL CAMPBELL MARK KING PHILLIPS AT THE MOMENT MARKING SOMETIMES YOU TURN UP AT WEMBLEY AS 
RED HOT FAVOURITES AND FORGET TO 
PLAY THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING 
WITH PORTSMOUTH 
KANU HAS GOT A 
FREE KICK PAPA BOUBA DIOP WILL BE A POSSIBLE 
TARGET HERE HE IS ON THE FAR SIDE 
OF THE PENALTY AREA HERMANN HREIDARSSON IS UP FOR PORTSMOUTH AND SOL CAMPBELL THERE IS A FLAG UP OFFSIDE WEST BROM GOT TO THIS STAGE BY 
BEATING CHARLTON ON PENALTIES 
PETERBOROUGH COVENTRY AND BRISTOL 
ROVERS NO PREMIERSHIP OPPONENTS 
UNTIL TODAY A GREAT TACKLE FROM ROBERTSON IN 
THE CENTRE CIRCLE HE TOOK NO 
PRISONERS 
A VERY COMPETITIVE PRISONERS INDIVIDUAL ROBERTSON AS EVERYONE 
WHO PLAYS AGAINST HIM KNOWS A BIT OF WORK FOR CAMPBELL TO DO AGITATED ISN'T HE HARRY AGITATED AND ANXIOUS OFFSIDE UP MILAN BAROS THAT IS 
WHAT HE DOES WELL NORMALLY HE 
MIGHT HAVE TWO OR THREE OF THOSE 
BEFORE HE EVENTUALLY GETS THROUGH 
BUT SOMETIMES YOU CAN TEST 
DEFENDERS BY RUNNING OF SIGHT TO 
SEE THEIR REACTION THEN YOU ADJUST 
YOUR RUN FREE KICK TO WEST BROM I THINK HE 
HAS KNOCKED MARTIN L. BRAXTON OVER 
HE MADE SURE HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS 
AND BEND HE HAS A LOOK MARTIN 
ALBRECHTSEN THERE IS NOTHING 
MALICIOUS ABOUT KANU 
HE WAS 
LOOKING VERY CONVINCING BUT 
NOTHING VERY CONVINCING ABOUT 
PORTSMOUTH SO FAR 
NO EVEN WHEN 
THEY HAVE THE BALL THERE ARE NO 
OPTIONS WEST BROM HAVE GOT TWO OR 
THREE DIFFERENT OPTIONS EVERY TIME 
THE MAN ON THE BALL RECEIVES IT MILAN BAROS FREE KICK WHAT ME GUV'NOR IT IS THE SLIGHTEST OF NUDGES 
ISN'T IT THAT'S WHERE FOOTBALL 
WORRIES YOU ISN'T IT ROBINS AND 
LOVES A CHALLENGE BY THE WAY THE 
SLIGHTEST NUDGE YOU FALL OVER THERE ARE ALSO CHASING PROMOTION 
TONY MOWBRAY'S TEAM THEY HAVE GOT 
A TEAM AWAY A GAME AWAY NEXT WEEK 
IT IS A DOUBLE EDGED A DEBATE FOR 
HIM AT THE MOMENT WHICH IS THE 
PRIORITY IT IS A POOR PASS THEY HAVE NOT 
GOT GOING PORTSMOUTH 
WHEN IT IS 
LIKE THIS YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE OF 
YOUR TOUCH TRIED TO GET EVERYBODY 
AROUND TO GET A TOUCH AND MAKE IT 
SIMPLE UNTIL YOU BUILD YOUR 
CONFIDENCE UP WEST BROM ARE VERY 
QUICK INTO PORTSMOUTH AREN'T THEY 
THEY ARE AROUND THEIR FEET ALL THE 
TIME THERE'S NO ROOM OUT THERE FOR 
PORTSMOUTH AT THE MOMENT FREE KICK ROMAN BEDNAR HAS SUPPORT ALL OVER THE PLACE THERE CARL HOEFKENS THAT'S ABOUT THE BEST PIECE OF 
FOOTBALL WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR MILAN 
BAROS HAS KNOCKED HIM OVER MILAN 
BAROS ON THE BALL NOW PHILLIPS IS FURTHER FORWARD IN THIS ATTACK THERE HE IS IN FACT BUT THE FREE KICK FOR MILAN BAROS IT IS A SILLY FOUL IS IT PLAY ON THIS WAS JAMES MORRISON WASN'T IT IT'S A FREE KICK FOR THE ALBION MARTIN ALBRECHTSEN HAS GONE FORWARD 
TO SUPPORT ROMAN BEDNAR AND 
PHILLIPS ROBINSON THEY JUST DON'T LOOK GOOD PORTSMOUTH AT ALL ZOLTAN GERA WILD WITH THE SHOT 
THIS MUST BE WORRYING FOR THE 
PORTSMOUTH BENCH 
YES THE OTHER 
THING AS WELL JOHN THERE IS NO 
GREAT SUPPORT BECAUSE PAPE BOUBA 
DIOP WHO WOULD RATHER PLAY IN THE 
MIDDLE AND NIKO KRANJCAR ARE BOTH 
TACT IN THERE'S NO GET OUT FOR 
THEM THE ONLY TIME THEY CAN DO IT 
IS WITH MILAN BAROS OVER THE TOP 
THE FLAG IS UP FOR A FOUL 
I DON'T 
KNOW WHY HE IS PROTESTING HIS 
INNOCENCE WHAT IS THIS HAND AROUND HIS NECK IT WASN'T HIS HAND OBVIOUSLY THERE IS NO THREAT TO THE ALBION 
GOAL AT ALL IN THE FIRST TWENTY SIX 
MINUTES HE IS A SPECTATOR REALLY DEAN KIELY THE GOALKEEPER THROW IN TO WEST BROM A CLASSIC 
PIECE OF FOOTBALL A LONG PASS AND 
A THROAT WHICH RELEASED ROMAN 
BEDNAR A THROW FREE KICK TO PORTSMOUTH THE ONLY 
THING TONY MOWBRAY WILL BE THINKING 
AT THE MOMENT LOSS OF POSSESSION 
WEST BROM THE ODD CHANCE THEY 
NEED A GOAL IF YOUR DOMINATING A 
GOAL LIKE THIS IN A SEMI FINAL AT 
WEMBLEY YOU NEED A GOAL 
ABSOLUTELY YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT 
THEY NEED TO GET INTO WINNING 
POSITION BECAUSE THEIR STRENGTHS 
ARE NOT REALLY IN DEFENCE LOOK AT 
THE POSSESSION FOR WEST BROM SIXTY TWO PER CENT 
FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP SIDE GOOD PLAY BY THE CAPTAIN BUT THAT'S 
GOING TO BE A FREE KICK THE 
REFEREE DECIDED TO PLAY AN 
ADVANTAGE ADVANTAGE FREE KICK TO PORTSMOUTH 
DEFINITELY THIS TIME 
WEST BROM 
ARE PROTESTING AS KANU GETS TO THE 
BALL HE IS NUDGED SULLEY ALI MUNTARI PUTTING THE BALL 
DOWN THERE HE HAS GOT NIKO 
KRANJCAR NEXT TO HIM ALBION HAD DECIDED TO FORM A WALL 
THEY KNOW HE IS CAPABLE OF LONG 
SHOTS ANOTHER MAN GOES INTO THE WALL HERE 
HE FIRES ONE STRAIGHT AT DEAN KIELY 
THAT COUNTS AS A SHOT BUT HE COULD 
HAVE THROWN HIS CAP ON IT AS WELL 
IT WAS SUCH A LONG LONG WAY AWAY JONATHAN GREENING IS REALLY 
CONDUCTING THE MIDFIELD YOU KNOW 
AND ROBERT KOREN AND PHILLIPS A 
SORT OF A TRIUMVIRATE IT'S VERY 
GOOD FOOTBALL FROM WEST BALM 
IT IS 
VERY GOOD L. THINK A LOT OF 
CHAMPIONSHIP TEAMS WOULD AGREE WITH 
THAT THEY DO PLAY SOME GOOD STUFF 
TONY MOWBRAY HAS INSISTED ON THAT 
THROUGHOUT THE SEASON IT'S VERY 
MUCH HIS PHILOSOPHY HERMANN HREIDARSSON 
PENALISED FOR A FOUL ON ZOLTAN GERA 
I THINK ZOLTAN GERA SLEPT HERE 
SLIPPED IT'S NO GOOD HERMANN HREIDARSSON 
HAVING A GO AT THE REFEREE NOW HE 
IS HAVING A GO AT ZOLTAN GERA 
INSTEAD THE WHOLE REASON FOR THAT 
PORTSMOUTH ATTACK THEY SUDDENLY 
GOT TIGHTER TO PHILLIPS AND 
SYLVAIN DISTIN PINCHED THE BALL OFF 
HIM AND START OF THE ATTACK ROMAN BEDNAR OF SIDE OFFSIDE ROMAN BEDNAR IS TECHNICALLY STILL 
ON LOAN BY THE WAY BUT THE DEAL 
HAS BEEN DONE BY WEST BROM UNTIL 
THE END OF THE SEASON THIS IS A 
VERY WORRIED MAN WHO HERE PAUL CROSS PAUL CROSS PORTSMOUTH GET AWAY WITH A GOAL KICK 
IT WAS STARTED BY DEAN KIELY KICK AND THEY WERE AGAIN PLAYING THROUGH 
THEM WEST BROM 
THE FIRST HALF HAS 
NOT GONE THE WAY YOU WOULD HAVE 
ANTICIPATED NOT FOR THE 
PREMIERSHIP TEAM THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
SIDE HAVE HAD THE FREEDOM OF 
WEMBLEY IN THE CENTRE OF THE FIELD I WONDER IF POMPEY THOUGHT ABOUT 
DROPPING DEAN KIELY OFF A LITTLE 
BIT I WONDER IF THAT MAKE DIFFERENCE IT WOULD LEAVE MILAN BAROS ON HIS 
OWN IN THE FRONT TO RUN UP THE 
CHANNELS HE IS GOING TO BOOK HIM HANDBALL 
I THINK HE IS BOOKING HIM FOR 
KICKING THE BALL AWAY DEFINITELY 
HANDBALL NO DOUBT ABOUT IT HE HAS 
BLOWN SO EARLY AND HE KNOWS MILAN 
BAROS HAS HEARD HIM BUT HE STILL 
WENT FOR THE SHOT 
IT IS A YELLOW 
CARD ONE WAY OR THE OTHER FOR 
MILAN BAROS ANYWAY THE WHISTLE HAD 
GONE EVERYONE HAD STOPPED THE HARRY IS OUT AGAIN IT HAS BEEN 
A JACK IN THE BOX FIRST HALF FOR 
HARRY REDKNAPP UP AND DOWN REALLY PHILLIPS WHAT IS DAVID JAMES DOING HE IS 
LAUGHING THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING 
NOW THEY DAVID JAMES HAS NOT HAD THE 
BEST OF FORTUNE IN WEMBLEY FINALS 
THIS IS A SEMI FINAL OF COURSE HE'D JUST WASTE OF IT ON THAT 
OCCASION THE NUMBER OF TIMES DEAN 
KIELY HAS GOT THE BALL JOHN HE 
HAS BEEN ABLE TO THROW IT OUT AND 
STOP WEST BROM FROM PLAYING THE 
GAME PORTSMOUTH ARE RETREATING 
THINKING IS GOING TO KICK IT SEVENTY 
YARDS THEY ARE THEN SO FAR BACK 
THERE IS SO MUCH ROOM FOR WEST BROM 
TO START THEIR ATTACKS PORTSMOUTH BALL THEY JUST CAN'T GET THE BALL PORTSMOUTH SYLVAIN DISTIN RAN UP FROM THE BACK 
AS IF TO SAY MAYBE I SHOULD TRY 
AND IMPROVE THINGS AS FORWARD HE HE TURNED HIS BACK ON THE PLAY WHICH 
DID NOT HELP HERE WE GO AGAIN WITH DEAN KIELY AWAY BY MARTIN ALBRECHTSEN HERMANN HREIDARSSON WITH THE THROW 
IN PAPE BOUBA DIOP HAS POSITIONED 
HIMSELF ON THE SIX YARD BOX BUT IT 
IS PLAYED SHORT TO NIKO KRANJCAR 
OH DEAR TERRIBLE PERFORMANCE BY 
PORTSMOUTH IN THE FIRST HALF FIVE MINUTES LEFT IN THE FIRST HALF 
AT WEMBLEY IN THE FIRST F. A. CUP 
SEMI FINAL ZERO TO ZERO THERE IS ONLY ONE 
TEAM IN IT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TIED PHILLIPS 
BEHIND CAMPBELL ON THE WRONG SIDE 
DEFENSIVELY FROM JOHNSON'S POINT 
OF VIEW WEST BROM ARE DOING THE CHAMPIONSHIP PROUD THE FIRST REALLY WORRYING MOMENT 
FOR THE WEST BROMWICH ALBION 
DEFENCE 
I THOUGHT MILAN BAROS WENT DEFENCE TO GROUND TOO EARLY TRYING TO GET 
IT PAST DEAN KIELY PAPE BOUBA DIOP 
WINS IT FLICKED ON BY KANU THE 
PROBLEM WITH MILAN BAROS HE ALWAYS 
FELT UNDER PRESSURE TO PRODUCE 
SOMETHING HARRY IS OUT AGAIN HE MUST JUST BE 
HOPING FOR HALF TIME NOW 
I WOULD 
SAY SO 
HE MUST KNOW WHAT ON EARTH 
WHERE UP TO HE MUST WANT TO KNOW 
WHAT AN EARTH THEY ARE UP TO IT'S QUITE EASY FOR TONY MOWBRAY THE SAME AGAIN PLEASE GENTLEMEN THE FLAG IS UP FOR OFFSIDE SEMI FINALS ALWAYS USED TO BE VERY 
NERVOUS AFFAIRS BUT THE NERVES 
TODAY SEEM TO HAVE GONE TO THE 
PREMIERSHIP TEAM THEY LOOK VERY 
INHIBITED TO WEST BROM'S CREDIT 
THEY ARE DOING THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
REALLY PROUD HERE PLAY ON ADVANTAGE SAYS HOWARD WEBB HE IS GOING TO GET CAUGHT HERE 
DWELLING ON THE BALL FOR TOO LONG 
THIS IS SYMPTOMATIC OF THE FIRST 
HALF FOUL UP WHEN WE GET TO THE FORTY FIFTH MINUTE 
THERE WILL BE ONE MINUTE OF ADDED 
TIME THE THAT IS A GOOD STRIKE BUT IT 
WOULD BE SOMETHING SPECIAL TO BEAT 
DEAN KIELY FROM THAT ANGLE 
CERTAINLY THE SLOW MOTION MOVED ABOUT AS 
QUICK AS YOU THERE 
THEY MOVED 
ABOUT AS QUICK AS PORTSMOUTH PAPA BOUBA DIOP IS DOWN FROM THE 
TACKLE BY ROBINSON I THINK THE 
REFEREE DEEMED IT FAIR CHALLENGE 
WE ARE ALREADY IN STOPPAGE TIME 
ONLY ONE MAN WANTED THE BALL THERE 
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO PLAY AGAINST 
ROBINSON WOULD YOU NO THE FINAL STAGES OF THE FIRST HALF 
IT IS A FREE KICK TO WEST BROM 
THERE IS FLAG UP FOR OFFSIDE 
THEY ARE GETTING IN ZERO TO ZERO PORTSMOUTH 
HARRY WILL BE PLEASED BECAUSE HE 
CAN GET IN THERE AND SORT IT OUT 
TONY MOWBRAY WILL BE SAYING WHAT 
WE NEED IS A GOAL THEY HAVE REALLY 
DOMINATED THE GAME THEY JUST NEED 
A GOAL FOR THEIR EFFORTS THEY 
HAVEN'T CAUSED DAVID JAMES TO CAUSE 
TOO MANY SAVES 
THAT IS RIGHT ON 
THE HALF TIME WHISTLE AS YOU SAY 
TONY MOWBRAY GOES TO HIS DRESSING 
ROOM KEVIN PHILLIPS THE MOST 
INFLUENTIAL PLAYER FROM THE KICK 
OFF FOR ME HE HAS GIVEN PORTSMOUTH 
A REAL PROBLEM AS TO HOW TO DEAL 
WITH WHERE HE IS PLAYING SOL 
CAMPBELL WALKS OFF LOOKING 
MYSTIFIED AND I WOULD IMAGINE THAT 
THE MORE ANIMATED DRESSING ROOM 
WOULD BE THAT OF THE PREMIERSHIP 
TEAM 
ONCE AGAIN A PREMIER LEAGUE TEAM 
STRUGGLING IN THE F. A. CUP PLAYING 
WELL BELOW THEIR NORMAL SELVES WE WE HAVE REALLY ENJOYED THE FIRST HALF 
BUT PORTSMOUTH ARE A TEAM OF 
STRANGERS NO COHESION CREATIVITY 
NO PARTY THE ONLY SAVING GRACE IS 
IT IS STILL ZERO TO ZERO THE FIRST 
IT IS STILL ZERO TO ZERO THE FIRST THIRTY MINUTES GOBBETT KEVIN PHILLIPS SO 
MUCH TIME AND SPACE THIRTY MINUTES 
LIKE JOHN MOTSON SAYS THE MORE 
ANIMATED DRESSING ROOM WILL BE THE 
PORTSMOUTH DRESSING ROOM 
IF WE 
DIDN'T KNOW OUR BUSINESS YOU WOULD 
THINK THESE TWO SIDES WEST 
BROMWICH ALBION WERE THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE SIDE 
THEY ARE THE ONLY TEAM 
THAT OUR PASSING AND MOVING AND 
FINDING THEIR OWN MEN EVERY TIME 
PORTSMOUTH GET IT THEY GIVE IT BACK 
MY ONE WORRY FOR WEST BROM WOULD BE 
YES THEY HAVE HAD A LOT OF 
POSITION BUT THEY HAVE NOT 
THREATENED ONCE THEY THREATENED 
AFTER FOUR MINUTES PORTSMOUTH HAVE 
TO PLAY BETTER THAN THAT IN THE 
SECOND HALF THEY KEEP GIVING IT 
BACK TO WEST BROM AND THEY ARE 
CAUSING THEIR OWN PROBLEMS 
NOT TOO 
MANY CHANCES IN THE FIRST HALF 
HARDLY ANY BUT I SUPPOSE WEST BROM 
WOULD BE THE HAPPIER OF THE TWO 
SIDES BECAUSE THEY ARE THE 
UNDERDOGS 
TO ME IT IS LIKE A BAD UNDERDOGS TRAINING SESSION FOR PORTSMOUTH 
THEY ARE PLAYING THEIR RESERVE TEAM 
AND THEY ARE THE FIRST TEAM IN A 
PRACTICE MATCH MIDWEEK BEFORE THE 
BIG GAME THAT IS NOT THE CASE IT 
IS A SEMI FINAL SOMETIMES THE 
RESERVE STRIKER BIT HARDER 
HOW CAN 
THEY COME OUT WITH THAT SORT OF 
ATTITUDE 
I THINK THEY HAVE COME ATTITUDE OUT AND THOUGHT IT WE WILL PASS 
THE BALL AROUND THEY HAVE BEEN 
BEATEN ALL OVER THE PITCH HARRY 
REDKNAPP WANTS TO GET MILAN BAROS 
AND KANU TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES 
ONE HAS PULLED WIDE ANOTHER HAS 
PULLED THE OTHER WAY THERE ARE 
MASSIVE GAPS UP FRONT THEY ARE NOT 
LINKING FROM MIDFIELD 
WE HAVE SEEN 
BEFORE IT IS A NOTORIOUSLY 
DIFFICULT GAME TO PLAY IN IF YOU 
WERE STRONG FAVOURITES YOU HAVE 
GOT TO START QUICKLY GET ABOUT 
YOUR BUSINESS AND PUT PRESSURE ON 
THE OPPOSITION BUT IT WAS THE 
OTHER WAY WEST BROM WERE PUTTING 
PRESSURE ON PORTSMOUTH 
THEY LOOK 
LIKE A TEAM WHO THINK WE HAVE JUST 
GOT TO TURN UP FOR THIS GAME JUST JUST ONE OPPORTUNITY FOR WEST BROM NOT 
A GREAT CHANCE 
BUT THE SHOT ON 
TARGET 
IT STARTS WITH KEVIN TARGET PHILLIPS IN THAT LITTLE HOLE WEST 
BROM PASSING IT AROUND NICE AND 
COMFORTABLE ONE TOUCH FOOTBALL 
BUT CAN HE PARTIED INTO HIM FIRST 
TIME L. THINK HE CAN ZOLTAN GERA 
TAKES THE CHANCE TO SHOOT AND YOU 
CANNOT KNOCK HIM FOR THAT DAVID DAVID JAMES WAS A BIT FORTUNATE 
ABSOLUTELY THINK THE BEST THING 
WOULD BE TO PLAY IT THERE AND GET 
THE SHOT IN THAT IS WHAT I SAID 
AT MY WORRY IS THAT THAT IS ALL 
THEY HAVE HAD TO SHOW FOR THEIR 
POSSESSION 
KEVIN PHILLIPS POSSESSION SOMETIMES IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO 
PICK THIS PERSON UP ONE OF THE 
CENTRE BACKS WE HAVE CIRCLED 
PHILLIPS ONE OF THE CENTRE BACKS 
HAS GOT TO COME OUT AND PICK HIM UP 
THEY BACK OFF PHILLIPS IS ISOLATED 
FOR A LONG TIME OCEANS OF SPACE 
EASY TO PLAY IN TWO THEN THEY GO 
TIGHT BUT WATCH IT BUT SYLVAIN 
DISTIN GOES FURTHER BACK HE IS THE 
LINK MAN PLAYED INTO HIS FEET AND 
WEST BROM HAD GOT IT EVENTUALLY IT 
COMES IN THE BOX AND IT IS QUITE 
DANGEROUS WHEREAS IN THE NEXT CLIP 
WHAT WE WILL SHOW YOU IT WHEN THEY 
ARE FURTHER UP THE PITCH WE HAVE 
CIRCLED SYLVAIN DISTIN AND PHILLIPS 
THIS TIME HE IS NOT TIGHT EASY TO 
MARK BUT IF YOU WATCH PHILLIPS' 
MOVEMENT IT IS REALLY GOOD 
BECAUSE HE IS FURTHER UP THE PITCH 
HE JUST READS IT AND IT IS EASY HE 
IS CLEAN THROUGH BASICALLY WHAT 
YOU'RE DOING IS MAKING THE CENTRE 
FORWARD THINK WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO 
DO NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND I I THINK THE TWO CENTRE HALVES WILL BE 
LOOKING TO SULLEY MUNTARI OR 
PREPARED TO DO THEIR JOB SAYING 
WE NEED A BIT OF HELP PAPA BOUBA 
DIOP 
HE IS DOING NOTHING ON THE DIOP RIGHT LEAVE MORRISON ON THE FULL 
BACK AND PULL HIM IN 
CAMPBELL AND 
SYLVAIN DISTIN DO NOT WANT TO GO TEN 
YARDS FURTHER FORWARD THEY DO NOT 
WANT TO GET DRAGGED OUT INTO THE 
HALL 
BUT THE HOLDING PLAYER DOES HALL NOT NEED TO MARK HIM HE NEEDS TO 
GET IN FRONT AND CUT THE SUPPLY OF 
HARRY REDKNAPP WILL CLEARLY HAVE TO 
DO SOMETHING ON THAT SCORE AS FOR 
PORTSMOUTH LOOKING AT THE CHANCES 
THEY HAVE HAD BASICALLY NOTHING 
ALL WE CAN FIND HIS EXAMPLES OF 
POOR PLAY 
THEY HAVE BEEN POOR ALL 
OVER THE PLACE THEY HAVE RUN INTO 
EACH OTHER THIS TIME IT IS SULLEY 
MUNTARI AND CAMPBELL BANGING INTO 
EACH OTHER IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE 
PLAYING A RESERVE TEAM GAME AND 
THEY ARE GOING ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS 
THEY ARE NOT GETTING ANY TACKLES IN 
THEIR PASSING HAS BEEN POOR THIS 
TIME SYLVAIN DISTIN TRIED TO PLAY 
THE BALL THERE IS NO EFFORT TO GET 
INDIVIDUALS INTO THE GAME THEY ARE 
PLAYING POORLY INDIVIDUALLY SEWN 
FORM A TEAM EFFORT IT GETS EVEN 
WORSE EVEN DAVID JAMES I THINK 
THE BALL EVENTUALLY COMES BACK IT 
JUST A LACK OF CONCENTRATION IN 
THE END IT IS SULLEY MUNTARI WHEN 
THE BALL GETS BORED THEY HAVE A 
LITTLE BREAK AWAY HOW HE DOESN'T 
KNOW SOMEBODY IS GOING TO CATCH UP 
WITH HIM AND THEY DO THAT 
TYPIFIED PORTSMOUTH IN THE FIRST 
HALF BRING NUGENT ON IN THE SECOND 
HALF HE IS THERE ANY REAL OPTION 
AND HE HASN'T GOT ANY PACE EITHER 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY HAVE PUT YOU 
AT THE END OF THE TABLE 
LET'S TAKE 
A BREATHER IT HAS BEEN 
SCINTILLATING STUFF AT WEMBLEY TO 
LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY'S OTHER BIG 
SPORTING EVENT THE GRAND NATIONAL

A SHOT OF BIG BEN 
WHICH IS OVER THERE SOMEWHERE IN 
CENTRAL LONDON AS OUR CAMERA 
SLIDES OUT OF TURN AND OVER TO 
NORTH LONDON AND THERE IS WEMBLEY 
STADIUM WHERE OF COURSE WE ARE 
PERCHED FOR THIS F. A. CUP SEMI FINAL 
BETWEEN PORTSMOUTH AND SOUTHPORT 
OH NO IT IS NOT WEST BROM IT HAS 
BEEN A DIFFICULT FIRST HALF BUT 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE GRAND NATIONAL 
I WOULD RATHER BE THERE IT IS A 
GREAT EVENT CLOUDY LANE RED RUM'S 
TRAINER A BIG LIVERPOOL SUPPORTER 
AS WELL A GREAT COMBINATION MR. MR SHEARER YOU ARE ALWAYS KEEN 
HORSE RACER YOU MUST LOVE IT I I THINK IT IS A GREAT DAY OUT THE 
GRAND NATIONAL WOULD BE A DAMN 
SIGHT MORE EXCITING THAN THAT FIRST 
HALF WITH THE TRAINER IN THE 
NORTH EAST HOWARD JOHNSON 
DID YOU 
HAVE A TALLY ON 
AT HALF TIME NOT NOT AT ALL L. DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 
HORSERACING BUT APPARENTLY IT IS 
GOING TO SNOW TOMORROW SO I AM 
GOING FOR SNOWY MORNING 
FIRST JUST TO LET YOU KNOW IF YOU 
WANT TO FOLLOW THE FOOTBALL THIS 
AFTERNOON PRESS THE RED BUTTON 
FROM TWO THIRTY P. M. 
ONE OF THOSE GAMES BEING PLAYED AS 
WE SPEAK AND ANDREW JAMES IS 
WATCHING ARSENAL PLAY LIVERPOOL 
LEE WILL BE PARTICULAR TO KNOW HE 
IS NOT MISSING MUCH HERE ARSENAL 
ARE STRUGGLING AT THE MOMENT 
AGAINST LIVERPOOL LIVERPOOL HAVE 
HAD THE BETTER CHANCES MANUELA ARE 
MANY ARE SAVING WELL JOHN ON A 
RESET FIRING OVER AFTER BEING PUT 
THROUGH BY PETER CROUCH 
JERMAINE PENNANT AGAINST HIS 
FORMER CLUB ALSO GOING CLOSE ALL 
OF THOSE CHANCES FOR LIVERPOOL WE 
HAVE SEEN NOTHING FROM ARSENAL SO 
FAR ARSENAL MADE FIVE CHANGES TO 
THE STARTING LINE UP TODAY EIGHTY 
CHANGES BY LIVERPOOL STEVEN 
GERRARD AND FERNANDO TORRES ON THE 
BENCH FOR THEM CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
GAMES COMING UP AND FEW DAYS' TIME 
ZERO TO ZERO THAT IS THE SAME TIME SCORELINE AS HERE BETWEEN 
PORTSMOUTH AND WEST BROMWICH ALBION 
HOW IS THAT GOING TO CHANGE THE THE INTRIGUE FOR ME IS ALWAYS IN THE 
DRESSING ROOM AT HALF TIME HARRY 
REDKNAPP WILL GO BEEN THERE HAVE A 
RANT AND RAVE GO AWAY AND SAY WE 
ARE STILL IN THIS COMPETITION WE 
HAVE GOT TO START PLAYING SHOW 
EVERYONE WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF 
DOING BUT TO BE TOGETHER IN THE 
FIRST HALF THEY WERE NOT TO GET AT 
ANY STAGE 
I SUPPOSE PORTSMOUTH 
HAVE GOT AWAY WITH IT 
THEY WILL BE 
HAPPY IT IS ZERO TO ZERO AS I SAID WEST 
BROM WILL TRY TO HAVE EXACTLY THE 
SAME POSITION AGAIN BUT TRIED TO 
DO SOMETHING WITH IT THIS TIME 
PAPE BOUBA DIOP HAS BEEN WASTED ON 
THE RIGHT HAND SIDE L. DON'T KNOW 
WHAT HE'S DOING OUT THERE WHETHER 
THEY CHANGED HIM OR HIS POSITION 
TRIED TO GET HIM INTO THE GAME A 
LITTLE BIT MORE WILL BE 
FASCINATING 
IT MUST BE DIFFICULT FASCINATING FOR TONY MOWBRAY BECAUSE HIS SIDE 
HAVE DONE PARTICULARLY WELL IN THE 
FIRST HALF BUT NOT DONE EXTREMELY 
WELL HOW DOES HE LIFT THEM TO MAKE 
A DIFFERENCE IN THE SECOND HALF HE HE WILL WANT MORE OF THE SAME BUT ON 
THE BENCH THEY HAVE GOT MILLER ON 
THE BENCH L. THINK THEY NEED TO GET THE BALL IN THE BOX AND MAYBE 
MILLER WILL AND THE END OF THE NINETY 
MINUTES AND HE IS A REAL THREAT 
AND CAN COME ON TO THE PITCH AND 
SCORE THEY HAVE GOT SOME FIREPOWER 
PORTSMOUTH HAVEN'T 
BUT PORTSMOUTH 
PLAYERS ARE JUST COMING OUT ONTO 
THE PITCH NOW IT'S NOT JUST THE 
FINAL WITHIN THEIR GRASP BUT 
ACTUALLY WINNING THE COMPETITION 
IS THE PRESSURE MOUNTING 
WELL TO 
A CERTAIN EXTENT THEY HAVE THE 
PRESSURE BECAUSE IT THEY ARE THE 
FAVOURITES NEVER EVER WILL THEY 
GET THE CHANCE TO WIN AGAIN 
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE SEMI 
FINAL IF YOU LOSE IN THE SEMI 
FINAL THERE'S NO USE IF YOU GET 
BEATEN IN THE FINAL EVERYONE HAS 
HAD A GOOD DAY OUT AND THAT'S IT 
I HAD BEEN BEATEN IN TWO FINALS 
AND IT'S NOT VERY PLEASANT I CAN'T 
TELL YOU 
LET'S SEE WHO MAKES IT TO 
THIS YEAR'S F. A. CUP FINAL A YEAR A EUROPEAN PLACE IS 
ALSO UP FOR GRABS SO THE INCENTIVE 
WILL BE EVEN STRONGER BENJANI TOP 
SCORER TWELVE JERMAIN DEFOE EIGHT 
KANU AND SULLEY ALI MUNTARI FIVE 
EACH DOES THAT TELL YOU SOMETHING 
IF WEST BROM SCORE IT WILL BE 
THEIR ONE HUNDRED T. H. GOAL OF THE SEASON IN 
THE LEAGUE OR CUP MAYBE HE IS CALLING IT TO MAKE A 
BET ON THE GRAND NATIONAL MAYBE 
NOT AT THIS STAGE OFFSIDE IT IS A FOUL I THINK ZOLTAN GERA THOUGHT HE WAS 
FOULED KNOCKED OFF THE BALL WHEN 
HE WENT TO TURN 
THE S. YES THE 
PORTSMOUTH SUPPORTERS WILL BE 
HOPING IF THEY SCORE PORTSMOUTH 
HAD A RECORD OF NEVER HAVING LOST 
AGAIN THIS SEASON THEY HAVE WON 
EVERY GAME IN WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN 
THE LEAD EIGHTEEN MATCHES IN LEAGUE AND 
CUP THIS HAS HAPPENED SO WE WILL 
SEE HOW THIS ONE AND FOALS 
UNFOLDS POMPEY HAVE LINED UP EXACTLY AS 
THEY WERE IN THE FIRST HALF JOHN 
I THINK THE BOYS HAVE A RIGHT PAPE 
BOUBA DIOP LOOKS MUCH MORE 
COMFORTABLE IN THE CENTRE OF 
MIDFIELD NOT STUCK OUT ON THE 
RIGHT WING HE GETS A CORNER THIS WILL BRING SOL CAMPBELL FORD 
AND HERMANN HREIDARSSON THIS 
WILL BRING SOL CAMPBELL FORWARD 
AND SYLVAIN DISTIN PAPE BOUBA DIOP CAMPBELL IS JUST DEBATING WHETHER 
TO STAY FORWARD HERE HERMANN 
HREIDARSSON CERTAINLY HAS IS 
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IF UTAKA 
HAD BEEN FIT PAPE BOUBA DIOP WOULD 
NOT BE PLAYING ON THE RIGHT WOULD 
HE BUT 
YOU HAVE TO ADAPT HE IT'S PART AND PARCEL OF THE MODERN 
GAME YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO PLAY 
THAT POSITION 
LEE WAS JUST TALKING 
ABOUT THE PORTSMOUTH BENCH NUGENT 
A STRIKER WHO HAS NEVER REALLY 
BROKEN THROUGH SINCE HE CAME UP 
FROM PRESTON HE IS IN THE 
SUBSTITUTES PEDRO MENDES MIGHT 
BRING SOME ENERGY TO THE MIDFIELD 
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT I DON'T REALLY DETECT ANY GREAT 
SENSE OF URGENCY ABOUT THEM AT THE 
MOMENT FALLOW BY ROBINSON FILE ROBINSON HE PRE EMPTED THE TACKLE PAPE 
BOUBA DIOP 
IT IS CERTAINLY NOT 
THERE IS IT APPEALS FOR HANDBALL AGAINST SOL CAMPBELL 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT JOHN CAMPBELL OF ALL THE GAMES WEST BROM HAVE 
PLAYED IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP I BET 
THEY HAVE NEVER HAD AS MUCH TIME 
AND PLACE AS THEY HAVE HAD TODAY 
WELL YOU DON'T GET IT IN THAT 
LEAGUE THEY GET HUSTLED AND 
BUSTLED BY TEAMS DOWN THERE ZOLTAN GERA SWITCHED SIDES THERE FOR A MOMENT JONATHAN GREENING STARTED HIS 
CAREER AT YORK AND HAD SPELL AT MANCHESTER UNITED IT'S OUT ABID LUCKY AGAIN PORTSMOUTH 
HERMANN HREIDARSSON BAD 
DISTRIBUTION 
OF THE BALL GOODNESS ME ANOTHER VERY BAD PIECE OF DISTRIBUTION BY SULLEY ALI MUNTARI AND THEY HAVEN'T BROUGHT NIKO 
KRANJCAR INTO THE GAME AND HE HAS 
GOT ABILITY KANU LOOKS LABOURED DEAN KIELY PRIOR TO THAT NICELY ON 
THE HEAD OF KEVIN PHILLIPS DEAN 
KIELY PLACED THAT NICELY ON THE 
HEAD OF KEVIN PHILLIPS 
HE ACTUALLY 
MADE A GOOD RUN THERE BECAUSE HE 
KEPT IN CELLS ONSIDE HE IS SAYING 
GET THE BALL DOWN AND PASS IT 
THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT PORTSMOUTH 
AT THE MOMENT IT TO MAKE YOU THINK 
THEY CAN WIN THIS GAME IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW BETTER THEY 
JUST DON'T SEEM TO BE LIVELY DO 
THEY FOOTBALL BEING WHAT IT IS 
THEY WILL PROBABLY SCORE NOW LOTS OF TEAMS HAVE TURNED UP FOR 
SEMI FINALS AND NOT PERFORMED 
HAVEN'T THEY 
ABSOLUTELY WEST BROM 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AGAINST QUEEN'S PARK 
RANGERS THEY PLAYED A SECOND DIVISION TEAM 
AND WERE BEATEN ANYWAY 
FREE KICK TO PORTSMOUTH HER 
HERMANN HREIDARSSON IS VERY ANXIOUS TO GET THIS BALL MILAN BAROS IT IS A GOAL KANU HAS PUT PORTSMOUTH AHEAD A 
BIT OF A FUMBLE BY DEAN KIELY LIKE 
I SAID A MOMENT AGO ISN'T THAT 
JUST FOOTBALL THEY WERE AWFUL FOR 
FIFTY FIVE MINUTES THEY HAVE SCORED THE 
FIRST GOAL OF 
THE SEMI FINAL JOHN JOHN THE THING HERE IS HE MAKES THE 
SAVE AND I THINK HE CAN THEN THEY 
GET TO THE SECOND ONE THE DEFENDER 
GETS INVOLVED HE MAKES IT EASY FOR 
KANU 
YES I HAD DONE A BIT OF A KANU DISSERVICE FOR DEAN KIELY IT IS A 
GOOD INITIAL SAVE BY HIS RIGHT HAND 
TO BE FAIR SPOT ON MILAN BAROS 
FIRST OF ALL HIS OWN DEFENDER 
STOPS HIM 
IT'S ZOLTAN GERA NUMBER 
ELEVEN 
IT IS A TAP IN FOR CARDIFF THE ELEVEN OTHER ALBION DEFENDERS DID NOT 
REACT IT IS A TAP IN FOR KANU ONE TO ZERO NINE AND ONE HALF MINUTES GONE IN THE 
SECOND HALF AT WEMBLEY AS I SAID A 
FEW MOMENTS AGO WHEN THEY SCORE 
FIRST PORTSMOUTH THIS SEASON THEY 
HAVE ALWAYS WON THAT REALLY HAS PUT A DIFFERENT 
COMPLEXION ON THE AFTERNOON HASN'T 
IT OH DEAR YES HE TRIED TO GET IT IN EARLY 
DIDN'T HE HE WAS NEVER REALLY 
COMFORTABLE OVER IT 
CAN'T YOU 
WON'T HAVE AN EASIER GOAL WILL HE 
YOU HAVE GOT TO FEEL SORRY FOR DEAN 
KIELY 
IT WAS A GOOD SAVE HE WAS KIELY GOING TO JUMP ON THE OTHER ONE IT 
IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT ESPECIALLY 
FOR DEAN KIELY IN THAT SITUATION TO 
TELL ZOLTAN GERA LEAVE IT BECAUSE 
HE WAS ALMOST OVER THE LINE YOU 
CAN UNDERSTAND WHY IT HAPPENED THAT'S BETTER KANU A IRONIC AS WELL BECAUSE PORTSMOUTH 
SUBSTITUTES HAVE JUST STARTED TO 
WARM UP MACRO OF WEST BROM SUFFERED HEARTBREAK LAST 
HERE IN THE PLAY OFF FRIENDLY 
AGAINST DERBY NOW IT IS TONY MOWBRAY'S TERM TO ASK HIMSELF WHAT TO DO NEXT HE IS ONSIDE SULLEY ALI MUNTARI 
HERE MILAN BAROS GOING INTO THE 
BOX HE DIDN'T MEAN TO MILAN BAROS 
WAS STANDING ON THE EIGHTEEN YARD LINE 
THERE 
HE DID NOT WORK HARD ENOUGH THERE TO GET HIMSELF THEN DID HE ALL 
THAT GOAL DID WAS A SPEED UP THE 
APPEARANCE OF ISHMAEL MILLER FOR 
ME 
THAT IS THE HAT TRICK MAN OF ME THE QUARTER FINAL ISHMAEL MILLER WHO WILL HE TAKE OFF THOUGH I WONDER FREE KICK WEST BROM HE HAS LOST IT PAPE BOUBA DIOP THE REFEREE HAS STOPPED THE GAME HE'D JUST HEARD HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS 
TRYING TO TWIST AND TURN AWAY FROM 
THE BALL HE HAD JUST HURTS 
HIMSELF A WAS THERE A HANDBALL IN THE BUILD UP 
HERE WE GO 
IT IS MILAN BAROS UP HE MAKES A MOVEMENT IT DOESN'T HE 
YES I THINK THAT THE CASE FOR 
COMPLAINT ALBION IT WAS NOT ONE 
YOU CAUGHT WITH THE NAKED EYE AT 
FIRST LOOKING BUT I THINK THEY 
WERE LUCKY ALBION WILL GET TWO 
SUBSTITUTES AVAILABLE HERE CHRIS 
BRYANT AND ISHMAEL MILLER TWO 
DIFFICULT DECISIONS FOR TONY 
KNOWBURY MILLER ON THE RIGHT IS 
THE STRIKER BUT BRUNT IS VERY 
TALENTED IN MIDFIELD 
YES MILLER 
WILL PLAY STRAIGHT THROUGH THE 
MIDDLE IS IT MORRISON MORRISON YES 
STRAIGHTS WHICH LEFT HAND SIDE 
ISN'T IT MILLER STRAIGHTFORWARD 
WITH KEVIN PHILLIPS VERY GOOD LEFT 
FOOT THE PSALMODY ARA MEANTIME 
HAS HAD TO GO OFF TO COME BACK ON 
I PRESUME LESS THAN A TIARA 
LESS THAN TWO SUBS ON FOR ALBION A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY NOW ON 
YOUNG ISHMAEL MILLER WHO CAME FROM 
MANCHESTER CITY EARLIER IN THE 
SEASON LIVERPOOL HAVE TAKEN 
THE LEAD AT THE EMIRATES PETER CROUCH JUST BEFORE HALF TIME THE SECOND PART OF THAT TRILOGY 
DEFEAT THERE WOULD SURELY MORE OR 
LESS END ARSENAL'S HOPES OF WINNING 
THE TITLE THIS TELLS YOU SOMETHING ABOUT TONY 
MOWBRAY'S PHILOSOPHY TWO ATTACKERS 
ON TRY TO GET THAT IMPORTANT GOAL 
BACK 
ONE GOAL DOWN HE MUST HAVE BACK DECIDED THAT WAS THE MOMENT TO PLAY 
THAT CARD THAT IS THE FIRST TIME A PORTSMOUTH 
PLAYER IN A WIDE AREA HAS COMMITTED 
AND WEST BROMWICH ALBION JOHNSON 
DOES REALLY WELL IT IS GREAT 
BALL HE TAKES ON ROBINSON GETS 
HALF A YARD PAST HIM WHAT OF ALL 
THAT IS 
ONCE AGAIN MILAN BAROS 
WAS NOT FAR ENOUGH FORWARD TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF IT WHAT A BALL THE GOALKEEPER HAS COME ALL THE WAY 
WELL DONE DEAN KIELY GOOD 
ANTICIPATION AND IT PAID OFF ROBERT KOREN THEM THROUGH THE 
MIDDLE MILLER WAS A DECOY RUN 
PORTSMOUTH MAY BE LOOKING TO HAVE A 
LITTLE BIT MORE SHAPE SINCE THEY 
SCORED 
A BIT MORE CONFIDENCE AND SCORED BELIEF WELL SAVED AGAIN BY DEAN KIELY IT 
IS BUT I THOUGHT FROM MOMENT THAT 
MILAN BAROS GOT PLAYED IN THAT 
DEAN KIELY HAD BOUGHT THE DUMMY AND 
WENT DOWN TO THE GROUND VERY EARLY 
I THOUGHT IN THE END THAT MILAN 
BAROS COULD TAKE IT PAST HIM HE 
HAS GONE RUN IT PAST HIM AND HAVE 
ANOTHER TOUCH 
HE IS NOT HAVING THE 
BEST OF DAYS SYLVAIN DISTIN 
HAS COME FORWARD SO HAS HERMANN HREIDARSSON 
AS PORTSMOUTH LOOK FOR THEIR SECOND I THINK WEST BROM'S PROBLEMS NOW AS THEY GO IN SEARCH OF THAT THE 
EQUALISER THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY GOING 
TO RELIEVE THEMSELVES LITTLE BIT 
OPEN TO THE COUNTER ATTACK FROM 
PORTSMOUTH TWO GOOD PIECES OF GOALKEEPING BY 
DEAN KIELY IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES 
OTHERWISE IT COULD HAVE BEEN ALL 
OVER 
I THINK MILAN BAROS SHOULD OVER HAVE SCORED KIELY WENT DOWN EARLY 
TAKE IT AS IT PASSED HIM AND IT IS 
A TAP IN FOR TWO TO ZERO THEY MIGHT THINK OF BRINGING ON 
DAVID NUGENT FOR MILAN BAROS WE 
SHALL SEE NEIL CLEMENT IS THE LONGEST SERVING ALBION PLAYER THERE IS A BIT MORE FREEDOM ABOVE 
PORTSMOUTH'S FOOTBALL 
IF THERE IS 
ONE MAN IN THEIR TEAM HE HAS SHOWN 
PASSION IT IS HERMANN HREIDARSSON 
HE HAS GOT REPUTATION FOR SETTING 
AN EXAMPLE INCIDENTALLY KANU WAS THE FIRST 
PLAYER TO SCORE IN HIS SEMI FINAL 
SINCE GUS POYET AGAINST NEWCASTLE 
IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND IT WAS DIFFICULT 
TO SCORE AT WEMBLEY SINCE THEN 
BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT PLAYED HERE BYE LITTLE LULL IN THE GAME FOR A 
COUPLE OF MINUTES A LITTLE THE THE FOOTBALL IS GOOD STILL BUT THEY 
CANNOT PLAY THAT PENETRATING PASS 
AT THE MOMENT ZOLTAN GERA DID EXTREMELY WELL HE 
WENT THROUGH TWO TACKLES AND STILL 
MANAGE TO THE SHOT 
HOWARD WEBB IS 
SORTING OUT SOMETHING A BIT OF 
BACKCHAT I THINK HE HAS BACKED 
AWAY I LIKE ZOLTAN GERA HE IS A 
GOOD FOOTBALLER ISN'T HE HIS HIS CLEARANCE WAS AND GRATE ON THE LINE 
THOUGH 
HE HAS TO LOOK AT HIMSELF THOUGH BECAUSE AS YOU RIGHTLY POINTED OUT 
DEAN KIELY COULD HAVE DROPPED ON IT 
WASN'T GREAT THE PROBLEM WITH BRUNT IS THAT HE 
HAS NO BURST OF PACE HE NEEDS A 
HALF YARD ON THE FULL BACK TO WHIP 
IT IN JOHNSON CLEVERLY HE IS IN A 
POSITION WHERE THE BALL WILL HIT 
HIM IF HE TRIES TO DO THAT THERE'LL BE A PORTSMOUTH CHANGED BY 
HARRY REDKNAPP L. THINK IT WAS ON 
THE CARDS DAVID NUGENT WHO MIGHT 
SCORE FOR ENGLAND AGAINST ANDORRA 
IS GOING TO REPLACE A VERY 
DISAPPOINTED MILAN BAROS THAT WAS 
NOT HIS INTERNATIONAL FORM NUGENT 
HAS ONLY HAD SEVEN STARTS YOU SAW 
A LOT OF HIM AT PRESTON 
HE DID 
EXTREMELY WELL THERE HE HAS NOT 
MADE THE TRANSITION YET WE WILL SEE WHAT HE CAN DO HERE NINETY 
MINUTES TO GO IN THIS SEMI FINAL 
SUBJECT TO THEIR NOT BEING EXTRA 
TIME AND PORTSMOUTH SOUTH THE 
ADVANTAGE NINETEEN PORTSMOUTH HAVE KANU SCORING 
AGAINST HIS OLD CUP THAT WILL BE 
THE STORY IF IT STAYS ONE TO ZERO CLUB DAVID NUGENT WILL RUN ALL DAY AND 
HE WILL RUN IN THE CHANNELS HE 
WILL WORK HIS SOCKS OFF I THINK HERMANN HREIDARSSON SLIP THAT IS A GOOD RUN SLIPPED OFFSIDE GIVEN HERE BY NUGENT I 
THINK A GOOD BALL IN WASN'T IT 
YES 
ONLY JUST 
STILL OFFSIDE YES THOUGH 
I WISH THEY USED THAT THOUGH DAYLIGHT INTERPRETATIONS BILL A 
WHAT HAPPENS AT NIGHT THIS IS AN 
EARLY KICK OFF HE HAS HIT THE BAR PORTSMOUTH 
THOUGHT THE BALL WAS OUT ON THE FAR 
SIDE TULL SINCE MADE THE RUN 
DIDN'T HE 
A FANTASTIC RUN 
PORTSMOUTH THOUGHT HE WAS OFFSIDE 
ONE OR TWO GOT OUT THE WAY AND IT 
WAS A NICE BALL IN BY ROBERT KOREN 
WHAT A GOOD STRIKE JAMES IS FLYING 
ACROSS HIS GOAL AND HE CANNOT DO 
MUCH ABOUT THAT THIS IS SHOT FROM 
ROBERT KOREN STRIKES THAT CROSSBAR 
HOW CLOSE CAN YOU GET THE SOUTH 
KOREAN WITH NEARLY FIFTY CAPS HAS COME 
ON HE HAS REPLACED ZOLTAN GERA 
KEANE WHO PLAYS ALONGSIDE PARK JI 
SUNG IN THE SOUTH KOREAN 
INTERNATIONAL TEAM IS ON A SIX 
MONTH LOAN AT THE MOMENT IF YOU CAN SEE THE NUMBERS ON THE WEST BROM SHIRT HE IS WEARING TWELVE SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES GONE AT WEMBLEY THE 
SEMI FINAL OF THE F. A. CUP WEST 
BROMWICH ALBION THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
SIDE DOMINATED HARRY REDKNAPP'S 
PORTSMOUTH FOR MORE THAN FORTY FIVE MINUTES 
BUT HAVE THEN FALLEN BEHIND AND HIT 
THE BAR THAT LOOKED LIKE BEING TWO TO ZERO I THINK 
THERE IS A DOUBLE CHALLENGE BUYS A 
CHALLENGE BUT HE GETS THROUGH 
THESE PLAYERS FAR TOO EASILY A 
LITTLE BIT LUCKY BEST BUYS A HE 
HAS GOT TO HIT THE TARGET FROM 
THERE 
A LEFT FOOTED PLAYER ON HIS THERE RIGHT DAVID JAMES SNATCHING IT WHEN KEVIN 
PHILLIPS WAS WAITING TO MAKE IT 
WAS ONE 
THE SUBSTITUTE WAS WITH THE WAS ONE BALL HE JUST SAT BACK A LITTLE BIT PHILLIPS WAS AT THE FAR POST COMING 
IN MILLER NEVER LOOKED AT THE 
SOUTH KOREANS HE IS IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE PICTURE HE WANTED A 
PULLBACK THAT WAS EASY FOR DAVID 
JAMES 
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY GOES JAMES BEGGING FOR WEST BROMWICH ALBION 
HOW ARE PORTSMOUTH GOING TO GET TO 
THE CUP FINAL WITHOUT PLAYING AT 
ALL WELL ROBERT KOREN WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH HIMSELF 
HE HAD A BIT MORE TIME HIMSELF THIS IS THE NEW WEMBLEY SETTLING 
DOWN AS THE STADIUM THE F. A. CUP 
SPONSORS GLEN JOHNSON MADE THE CHALLENGE AND 
GOT THE THROW 
HE IS CLEVER HE WAS 
ABOUT TO MAKE THE CHALLENGE SORT 
BRUNT MOVE OUT OF THE WAY AND 
JOHNSON JUST LEFT HIM SAW BRUNT OFFSIDE GIVEN AGAINST DAVID NUGENT A LEFT FOOTED PLAYER WITH A RIGHT 
FOOTED CROSS HE SHOULD BE 
COMFORTABLE WITH THOSE AREAS 
BECAUSE THE START ABOUT AS A WIDE 
PLAYER AT MANCHESTER CITY 
HE WAS 
AN OUTSIDE LEFT HERE IS SEAN DAVIS 
I WOULD IMAGINE THIS IS FOR KANU 
THE MAN WHO SCORED A GOAL AGAINST 
HIS OWN CLUB HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO OFF THEY GO FOR FIVE TO ONE WITH DAVID NUGENT 
SEAN DAVIS AS A ROUTINE MIDFIELD 
PLAYER 
PROTECT WHAT YOU HAVE GOT PLAYER BASICALLY IT MEANS THAT ROBINSON AND CARL 
HOEFKENS THE TWO FULL BACKS CAN 
JUST TAKE THEIR CHANCES GREENING WORKING VERY HARD TO KEEP WEST BROMWICH MOVING JUST THE WRONG SIDE OF KEVIN PHILLIPS NIKO KRANJCAR LOOKED OUT ON HIS 
FEET CHASING THAT BALL DON'T DON'T FORGET YOU HAVE GOT THE GRAND 
NATIONAL TO LOOK FORWARD TO THIS 
AFTERNOON AT FOUR FIFTEEN P. M. THAT IS THE 
START OF THE RACE AND THERE IS 
MATCH OF THE DAY TONIGHT AT TEN TEN P. M. 
WITH HIGHLIGHTS OF TODAY'S 
PREMIERSHIP FOOTBALL DO YOU THINK PORTSMOUTH GOT BETTER 
WHEN THEY SCORED PORTSMOUTH PORTSMOUTH COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE THEY WERE 
VERY POOR BUT THE CONFIDENCE OF 
THE GOAL MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE TO 
THEM MILAN BAROS SHOULD HAVE MADE 
IT TWO TO ZERO AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GAME 
OVER BUT WITH JUST OVER TEN MINUTES 
TO GO WEST BROM THINK THEY CAN 
PINCH AN EQUALISER 
I UNDERSTAND 
THERE WAS SOME BAD LANGUAGE HEARD 
FROM THE CROWD WHICH WE REGRET I I THINK IT WAS ONE OF THE DEFENDERS 
WASN'T IT IN FACT GOT I KNOW IT 
WAS SAVED BY DEAN KIELY A FOUL BY NUGENT 
HE JUST SEEMED TO PANIC NUGENT DAVID NUGENT WHEN HE GOT THE BALL 
HE COULD HAVE HAD ANOTHER TUT YOU 
KNOW YOU CANNOT TACKLE IN THE 
PENALTY AREA HE COULD HAVE HAD 
ANOTHER TOUCH NOW THAT A CHANCE ANOTHER GREAT 
BALL FROM CARL HOEFKENS HE HAS 
MADE FORTY YARDS THE RIGHT BACK HE 
COMES INTO THE PICTURE WHAT A GOOD 
BALL THIS IS 
A WARNING FOR POMPEY 
THE OFFICIAL ATTENDANCE BY THE WAY 
EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR THEY WERE WORRIED 
ABOUT TOO MANY EMPTY SEATS IT IS A 
GOOD CROWD ABOUT THIS SEMI FINAL 
FOR THOSE PEOPLE AGAINST THE SEMI 
FINALS BEING PLAYED AT WEMBLEY YOU 
COULD NOT GET THIS MANY PEOPLE IN 
DEVELOPED PARK FOR A SEMI FINAL 
WHICH IS WHERE THEY USED TO BE 
PLAYED AND IT IS AN EARLY KICK OFF A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR SUPPORTERS 
TO SEE THEIR TEAMS AT WEMBLEY EVEN 
THOUGH TWO SETS OF FANS THIS 
WEEKEND WILL BE DISAPPOINTED TO SEE 
THEIR TEAMS KNOCKED UP 
I WAS HERE 
AT NINE THIRTY AM THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF 
SUPPORTERS HERE L. WAS JUST TRYING TO LET YOU KNOW 
I WAS HERE EARLY I THINK IT IS CARL HOEFKENS AGAIN I THINK HE SLIPS OVER HERE L. THINK 
THEY BOTH SLIPOVER HIMSELF AND THE 
PORTSMOUTH DEFENDER YOU WATCH THIS THEY BOTH SLIPOVER 
YES NIKO KRANJCAR SLIPS OVER AND 
DONE CARL HOEFKENS SLIPS INTO HIM 
A BIT HARSH REALLY RIGHT THE 
LAST FIVE MINUTES IN THIS WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IT IS A 
FREE KICK ISN'T IT HERMANN 
HREIDARSSON WAS IT NO IT IS NIKO 
KRANJCAR DAVID NUGENT WORKING VERY HARD HERE FREE KICK ARSENAL HAVE EQUALISED AT THE 
EMIRATES STADIUM NICKLAUS BENT 
ENOUGH BUT HE HAS SCORED TODAY ONE TO ONE AT THE 
END IT STADIUM IT IS ONE TO ZERO AT 
WEMBLEY IT IS A REAL HEAVYWEIGHT TEST THOSE TWO AWKWARD FOR DAVID JAMES AND IT HAS STAYED IN PLACE NOW THEN COME ON HE SAYS LET'S HAVE SOME SUPPORT LEFT FOOT ROBINSON IS COMING FORWARD CLEMENT IS THERE MARTIN ALBRECHTSEN HE HAS FALLEN OVER IT'S JUST A PITY IT WAS WELL WORKED BY A WEST BROM AS WELL I'M NOT SURE IF PORTSMOUTH HAVE PLAYED AS BAD AS THIS ALL SEASON THE ANNOUNCER IS SAYING IT IS THE 
BIGGEST SELLING FINAL ATTENDANCE 
FOR A SIXTY TWO YEARS SINCE DERBY CARTY 
DERBY COUNTY IN NINETEEN FORTY SIX PLAYED AT 
MAINE ROAD IS THERE A CHANCE FOR 
PORTS NOT TO SAVE IT PORTSMOUTH 
ARE SO CLOSE TO THE FINAL HERE 
FREE KICK PROTESTS FROM WEST BROM THREE MINUTES OF ADDED TIME HERE 
WE ARE APPROACHING THE NINETY MINUTE 
MARK ALBION WILL BE ANXIOUS NOW 
PORTSMOUTH CAN SENSE THEIR FIRST F. A. 
CUP FINAL SINCE NINETEEN THIRTY NINE I'M SURE THEY 
WILL ADMIT THEY HAVE NOT PLAYED 
WELL BUT BETTER SINCE THEY SCORED 
PAPE BOUBA DIOP DOWN THE SIDE THAT 
HAS GOT THE ASSISTANT REFEREE'S 
VERDICT THE THEY WON'T BE IN A HURRY YEAR WILL THEY NIKO KRANJCAR LOOKS LIKE HE IS GOING TO TRY AND KEEP IT HERE THE GAME IS OVER PORTSMOUTH FANS ARE STARTING TO WHISTLE AN OFFSIDE FLAG THERE HARRY REDKNAPP AT SIXTY ONE THIS IS THE 
CLOSEST HE'S EVER BEEN AS A PLAYER 
AND MANAGER TO AN F. A. CUP FINAL HE WILL BE SAYING STICK IT IN THE CORNER BY WE MAKE IT THIRTY PAPE BOUBA DIOP BLASTED CARELESSLY NIKO KRANJCAR ON THE RUN A CHANCE 
FOR DAVID NUGENT UP HE HAS MISSED 
IT 
HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO DRAW HIS IT FOOT BACK AND THE CHALLENGE CAME IN 
I THINK IT WAS ROBINSON WAS IT IT IT COULD SO EASILY HAVE BEEN TWO TO ZERO BUT 
IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE THE 
REFEREE HAS PLAYED THE THREE 
ALLOTTED MINUTES ONE MORE ALBION ATTACK MAY BE NOW THEN DEAN KIELY IS COMING UP BUT GOALKEEPER THIS IS IT EITHER ALBION'S CALL 
AND GETS EXTRA TIME OR PORTSMOUTH 
GOES INTO THE FINAL EITHER 
ALBION HAVE SCORES AND GETS EXTRA 
TIME OR PORTSMOUTH GOES INTO THE 
FINAL PORTSMOUTH HAVE REACHED THE F. A. CUP 
FINAL FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE 
SECOND WORLD WAR SINCE THEY WON IN 
NINETEEN THIRTY NINE HARRY REDKNAPP MAKES A LITTLE 
BIT OF PERSONAL HISTORY PORTSMOUTH 
WHO WERE BAD IN THE FIRST HALF CAN 
NOW CELEBRATE KANU THE GOALSCORER 
ON THIRTY FOUR MINUTES THE SOUTH COAST CLUB 
WHO HAVE BEEN REVIVED IN THE 
REDKNAPP AREA ERA MAKE THE 
QUALITY COME THROUGH CERTAINLY 
WITH THE RESULT IT MEANS THERE 
WILL BE A CHAMPIONSHIP CLUB IN THE 
F. A. CUP FINAL ON MAY SEVENTEENTH KANU WHO 
USED TO PLAY FOR WEST BROM SCORED 
THE GOAL JUST AFTER HALF TIME THEY 
WILL PAY BARNSLEY OR CARDIFF CITY 
AND IF THEY WIN THAT THEY WILL BE 
IN THE UEFA CUP PORTSMOUTH IT 
WASN'T A GREAT SEMI FINAL BUT IT 
HAD ITS MOMENTS 
IT DID AS BADLY 
AS PORTSMOUTH PLAYED JOHN THEY 
HAD A FEW CHANCES AND COULD HAVE 
WON THIS GAME TWO TO ZERO L. THINK WEST 
BROM WERE VERY VERY GOOD INDEED 
AND PLAYED FAR AND AWAY ABOVE THEIR 
STATUS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT THEY 
LACKED A CUTTING EDGE IN THE GAME 
AND DID NOT MAKE TOO MANY CHANCES 
HARRY A MANY CONGRATULATIONS IT'S IT'S GREAT FOR PORTSMOUTH IT'S IT'S FANTASTIC TO GO TO THE F. A. CUP FINAL 
THEY PASS THE BALL WELL AND MADE A 
GREAT GAME OF IT A GREAT DAY FOR 
THE CLUB 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR YOU 
PERSONALLY 
IT GREAT IT'S GOOD FOR PERSONALLY MY FAMILY THE SUPPORTERS I'M 
DELIGHTED FOR EVERYBODY 
WHAT WENT 
WRONG IN THE FIRST HALF 
THE WE DID 
NOT PASS THE BALL WELL L. KNEW THEY 
WOULD DO WELL THEY ARE A GOOD TEAM 
I THINK THEY WILL COME UP THIS YEAR 
MAGNIFICENT 
A SOL CAMPBELL MANY MAGNIFICENT CONGRATULATIONS HOW DOES THIS 
FIELD 
FANTASTIC F. A. CUP FINAL WE FIELD PLAYED WELL WEST BROM IN THE 
FIRST HALF THEY WERE VERY GOOD IN 
THE SECOND HALF WE CAME OUT ON TOP 
YOU HAVE BEEN IN FINALS BEFORE WITH 
ARSENAL IS THIS SPECIAL BECAUSE 
IT'S NOT ONE OF THE BIG FOUR CLUBS 
YES IT'S FANTASTIC IT'S BRILLIANT 
FANTASTIC FOR PORTSMOUTH AND 
ANYBODY INVOLVED WITH PORTSMOUTH 
DID THE PRESSURE OF BEING 
FAVOURITES WEIGH HEAVY ON YOU WELL WELL THEY HAD NOTHING TO LOSE SO WE HAD 
TO GO OUT AND WIN THE GAME WE ARE 
THROUGH TO THE FINAL IT'S 
FANTASTIC 
THE GOAL WAS A BIT FANTASTIC SCRAPPY AND THERE WAS A SUSPICION 
OF HANDBALL 
YEAH US BUT WE SHOULD 
HAVE AT THE OTHER COUPLE AFTER THAT 
MANY CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU 
THE CELEBRATIONS WILL START NOW FOR 
PORTSMOUTH THE PLAYERS AND 
SUPPORTERS HAVE HAD A TERRIFIC 
SEASON IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE AS 
WELL IT SHOULD BE SAID THIS WAS 
DAY WHEN THEY JUST DID NOT DO 
THEMSELVES JUSTICE KANU BECOMING 
A LONG GOAL ON FIFTY FOUR MINUTES THEY 
WILL LOOK BACK AND QUESTION WHETHER 
THERE WAS HANDBALL AGAINST MILAN 
BAROS BUT I THINK DAVID JAMES IS 
WAITING FOR US 
DAVID ANOTHER FINAL FOR YOU HOW 
DOES IT FEEL 
FANTASTIC L. THOUGHT 
WE DOMINATED THE GAME TODAY IT 
CAME DOWN TO A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF 
CHANCES 
THEY HAD A PERIOD IN THE CHANCES FIRST HALF WHERE THEY TOOK CONTROL 
WAS IT KEY TO STOP THEM SCORING 
THAT'S TYPICAL OF PORTSMOUTH WE 
KNEW THAT WE WERE GOING TO WIN THE 
GAME L. THINK WE CONTROL DID AS 
MUCH AS THEY DID IN POSSESSION 
EVERYONE IS HAPPY 
YOU HAVE BEEN IN 
FINALS BEFORE AND LOST FINALS WE WE HAVE GOT THROUGH NOW AND WE WILL 
SEE WHO REPLACED TOMORROW THE LADS 
ARE BUZZING IT WAS A CONFIDENT 
AGAIN THAT'S WHAT WE NEEDED 
PORTSMOUTH FANS HAVE BEEN GOING MAD 
FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS AND WE 
HOPE TO MAKE IT A GOOD DAY IN THE 
FINAL FINAL WE MIGHT ARGUE ABOUT WHETHER THEY 
DOMINATED THE HOME GAME LET'S HAVE 
A WORD WITH KEVIN PHILLIPS 
HOW DOES IT FEEL 
IT'S A TERRIBLE 
QUESTION I'M GUTTED L. L. DON'T THINK 
WE DESERVED TO LOSE THE GAME WE 
ARE A GOOD QUALITY TEAM BUT WE 
COULD NOT FIND GOAL TODAY OUR 
OVERALL PLAY THEY DESERVED IT 
THERE WAS STRONG SUSPICION OF 
HANDBALL ON THE WAY IN IS THAT HOW 
YOU SAW IT 
I CAN'T HEAR YOU YES 
AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW 
WHAT OFFICIALS ARE LIKE IN THESE 
BIG GAMES AT THE END OF THE DAY I 
THINK WE CAN HOLD OUR HEADS UP HIGH 
AN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE BUT WE 
DID NOT FIND A GOAL L. THINK 
PORTSMOUTH WERE VERY LUCKY TODAY 
HAD WE FOUND A GOAL IN THE FIRST 
HALF I THINK HE WOULD HAVE WON 
THE IMPORTANT THING NOW IS THAT YOU 
DON'T LET THIS DIVERGES FROM YOUR 
MAIN OBJECTIVE THIS YEAR YES YES PROMOTION IS OUR MAIN AIM YES 
IT'S DISAPPOINTING TODAY BUT 
HOPEFULLY WE WILL DO WELL AGAINST 
BLACKPOOL ON TUESDAY 
COMMISERATIONS COMMISERATIONS YES LOTS OF D. WILL WISH 
ALBION WELL IN THEIR PROMOTION 
LET'S HEAR FROM KANU 
KANU MANY CONGRATULATIONS TELL ME 
ABOUT THE GOAL WHICH WON THE GAME 
YES I WAS LUCKY TO SCORE 
YOU HAVE 
A BIT OF SYMPATHY FOR YOUR FORMER 
CLUB PERHAPS 
YES THEY DID GREAT 
YOU HAVE BEEN TWO FINALS BEFORE 
ARSENAL A CHANCE NOW FOR A 
STARRING ROLE IN THE FINAL 
YES I 
HAVE BEEN THERE TWO TIMES TO WIN 
IT WOULD BE THE BEST 
THE FANS HAVE 
BEEN TERRIFIC FOR ALL SEASON THE THE FANTASTIC THEY ARE BEHIND US 
IT WAS KANU'S GOAL THAT SETTLED 
THIS FIRST SEMI FINAL IT IS NOW 
BOUND TO BARNSLEY AND CARDIFF 
TOMORROW TO DETERMINE WHICH 
CHAMPIONSHIP CLUB PLAYS PORTSMOUTH 
IN THE FINAL BUT IF THEY DO THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP AS MUCH JUSTICE AS 
WEST BROM DID TODAY THEY WILL BE 
PROUD OF THEMSELVES IT IS ALL 
ABOUT WHO WINS AND HIS PORTSMOUTH 
WHO GO BACK TO WEMBLEY IN FIVE 
WEEKS' TIME 
THE FACT WE HAVE NOT SEEN A SHOCK 
IN THE SEMI FINAL OF THE F. A. CUP 
THIS YEAR IS ALMOST SHOCK IN ITSELF 
IT IS WEST BROM WERE THE ITSELF BETTER TEAM THEY PLAYED WELL AND 
ACQUITTED THEMSELVES SO WELL IT 
WILL BE SCANT CONSOLATION IN THAT 
DRESSING ROOM AT THE MINUTE IT IS 
VERY UNUSUAL FOR ANY TEAM TO PLAY 
SO BADLY IN THE SEMI FINAL OF THIS 
COMPETITION AND WIN PORTSMOUTH 
HAVE GOT TO GEL BUT WHEN THEY LINE 
UP IN THE FINAL HARRY REDKNAPP A 
TRIBUTE TO HIM HE HAS DONE A 
FANTASTIC JOB WHEN HE TOOK OVER 
THEY WERE DOWN AND OUT NOW THEY 
ARE RUN THE CUP FINAL FANTASTIC A A WORD FOR WEST BROM THEY GAVE 
EVERYTHING DO YOU FEEL SYMPATHY 
THEY WERE VERY PLUCKY THEY PLAYED 
NEAT TIDY FOOTBALL PROBABLY THE 
BETTER SIDE ON THE DAY CERTAINLY 
THE FIRST HALF BUT WHERE IT REALLY 
MATTERS IS THE BUSINESS END ONCE 
THEY GOT ON TO THE BUSINESS END OF 
THE PITCH THE LAST THIRD I 
COULDN'T SEE THEM SCORING COULD 
ONLY REMEMBER THEM WORKING THE 
GOALKEEPER AFTER FIVE MINUTES AT 
THIS LEVEL THAT IS WHY YOU NEED TO 
IMPROVE THAT END OF THE PITCH 
WHEN YOU GET LITTLE HALF CHANCES 
THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE PORTSMOUTH 
THAT HATS SHOULD HAVE SCORED 
ANOTHER ONE OR TWO PERHAPS 
PORTSMOUTH DID NOT PLAY WELL BUT 
THEY DO NOT HAVE TO THEY HAVE TO 
GET THROUGH 
IT IS ALL ABOUT 
GETTING TO THE FINAL 
WE HAVE ALL 
BEEN TO A SEMI FINAL AND LOST IT 
IS NOT A NICE FEELING WEST BROM 
DID EVERYTHING THEY PASSED THE 
BALL BETTER THEY OUT THOUGHT 
PORTSMOUTH IN THE FIRST HALF AND 
AS ALLEN SAID THEY DIDN'T CREATE 
ANYTHING THE BACK FOUR WAS KEY IF 
THEY HAD A GOOD GAME THEY WOULD 
NOT GET PAST THEM IN THE END WEST 
BROM RAN OUT OF IDEAS IN THE LAST 
THIRD ISHMAEL MILLER KIND OF 
CHANGE IT BUT HE WAS OFF THE PACE 
YOU ALWAYS FELT ONCE PORTSMOUTH 
WENT ONE TO ZERO UP IT WAS GAME OVER THE THE WINNING GOAL ONLY ONE GOAL IN THE 
GAME AN ELEMENT OF CONTROVERSY 
HANDBALL OR NOT IT 
IT WAS DEFINITELY 
HANDBALL OR NOT IT WAS DEFINITELY HANDBALL THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT 
IT IT IS JUST THAT YOU CAN SEE THE 
ASSISTANT AND THE REFEREE WHAT DO 
YOU THINK 
IT IS HANDBALL WITHOUT 
THE DUP BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE 
SYMPATHY WITH THE REFEREE AND THE 
ASSISTANT TO GIVE THAT IS A TOUGH 
CALL THE DEFENDER GETS ON THE 
WRONG SIDE FIRST AND FOREMOST IT 
IS HANDBALL BUT IT IS TOUGH FOR THE 
REFEREE TO SEE 
AT ZOLTAN GERA GETS 
IN HIS WAY IF HE LETS THE 
GOALKEEPER DIVED ON THAT HE 
PROBABLY GETS THAT 
THIS IS 
INTERESTING BECAUSE ALL DAY MILAN 
BAROS WAS GETTING BETWEEN THE TWO 
CENTRE BACKS LOOK AT THEM THEN 
WHEN THE BALL WAS SWITCHED TO THE 
OTHER SIDE THEY START TO SPLIT 
MILAN BAROS IS STILL THERE THE 
BALL OVER THE TOP HE IS ON TO IT 
QUICK WEST BROM KNEW NOTHING ABOUT 
IT AND IT IS IN THE BACK OF THE NET 
A BIG MOMENT FOR HARRY REDKNAPP 
FANTASTIC FOR HIM HE DESERVES IT 
HE HAS BEEN THROUGH ALMOST 
EVERYTHING IN FOOTBALL HE HAS BEEN 
IN IT FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER 
WE SAW THE BARRACKS AND BALL 
MILAN BAROS THERE WAS AN EXAMPLE 
IN THE FIRST HALF WHEN HE GOT BIG 
YELLOW CARD 
VERY SIMILAR BALL 
OVER THE TOP HE IS ON TO IT 
WATCHING IT ALL THE WAY SIMILAR SIMILAR VERY SIMILAR 
PAUL MERSON USED TO 
CHEST THE BALL DOWN WITH HIS HAND 
IT IS HIS TECHNIQUE AND HE GOT 
AWAY WITH IT WHEN IT MATTERED 
DIFFICULT TO SPOT IN THE BOX THESE THESE ARE THE WEST BROM CHANCES 
THE LAST 
FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES AS LONG AS IT IS 
ONE TO ZERO THE TEAM IN FRONT WILL BE ON 
EDGE A FANTASTIC RUN A BRILLIANT 
HIT 
HE COULD NOT HAVE HIT IT HIT BETTER BRILLIANT 
THIS IS WHAT BETTER BRILLIANT MILLER IS ALL ABOUT IT IS A GOOD 
STRIKE BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT 
BE HIS DAY WHEN HE HIT THE BAR BUT 
WHEN HE CAME ON WHEN HE DID CREATE 
SOMETHING 
HE HUSTLES SOL SOMETHING CAMPBELL OUT OF THIS ONE 
THIS IS 
WHERE YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT COUNT 
PARTICULARLY AGAINST A PREMIERSHIP 
TEAM 
HE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TEAM TO DO WITH IT A GREAT OPPORTUNITY 
THEY ARE THERE IN NUMBERS 
IF HE 
GOES ANOTHER FIVE YARDS THERE IS A 
LITTLE PULL BACK ON GOOD GOOD GOALKEEPING 
HE DID WHAT HE HAD TO GOALKEEPING DO ANOTHER CHANCE AGAIN 
ON THE 
RIGHT HAND SIDE AND IT WAS PLAYED 
IN A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT FROM 
ISHMAEL MILLER A DECENT BALL INTO 
THE BOX NOT BAD 
NO BUT YOU KEEP 
COMING BACK TO THE POINT YOU HAVE 
TO HIT THE TARGET IF YOU DON'T 
MAKE IT COUNT YOU GET WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED TO WEST BROM TODAY IT IS 
SAD AND DIFFICULT FOR THEM BUT THAT 
IS THE HARSH REALITY ALTHOUGH ALTHOUGH PROBABLY THE MISS OF THE GAME WAS 
MILAN BAROS' 
WE ALL THOUGHT IT WAS 
GAME OVER AT THIS POINT HE PEELED 
OFF INSIDE THE CENTRE BACK AND AS 
HE GETS IN THESE NEXT TOUCH IS 
HORRENDOUS EVEN I THOUGHT HE 
SHOULD DREADED AROUND HIM AND I'M A 
FULL BACK 
IT IS A FULL BACK'S FULL BACK TOUCH 
THE OPTION IS TO DINK IT NOW TOUCH BUT HE TRIES TO TAKE AROUND HIM A A FUNNY PLAYER MILAN BAROS A 
CONSTANT THREAT 
EVERY CLIP WE HAVE 
SHOWN HE IS EITHER BETWEEN THE TWO 
CENTRE BACKS OR AROUND THE CENTRE 
BACK AND THE FULL BACK IT IS JUST 
THE TOUCH THAT LETS HIM DOWN THIS 
IS A PRIME EXAMPLE AGAIN A BALL 
OVER THE TOP BUT YOU WOULD EXPECT A 
BETTER TOUCH THAN THAT AND HE 
WOULD BE IN THEN WHEN WEST BROM 
WERE HIGH UP THE PITCH AGAIN 
ANOTHER LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT 
JUST OFFSIDE BUT VERY ADEPT AT 
GETTING BETWEEN PLAYERS 
WE HAVE 
SEEN HIM SCORE GOALS BEFORE HE WAS 
TOP SCORER IN THE EUROPEAN 
CHAMPIONSHIPS 
WE CAN HEAR FROM CHAMPIONSHIPS TONY MOWBRAY 
IT IS ALWAYS HORRIBLE TO HAVE TO DO 
THIS INTERVIEW THAT MUST FEEL 
TERRIBLE 
NO IT IS O. K. IT WAS TERRIBLE IMPORTANT THAT WE CAME OUT OF THIS 
GAME WITH A BIT OF CONFIDENCE AND 
BELIEF WE HAVE SOME VERY IMPORTANT 
LEAGUE FIXTURES TO PLAY AND SURE 
ENOUGH WE ARE A DECENT ENOUGH 
FOOTBALL TEAM WE HAVE SCORED NINETY NINE 
GOALS IN ALL COMPETITIONS IT WAS 
FRUSTRATING TODAY BUT WE COME OUT 
WITH SIX GAMES TO GO AND WE WILL 
TRY TO PLAY WEEK IN WEEK OUT IN 
THE PREMIERSHIP 
NINETY NINE GOALS THIS 
SEASON AND YOU NEED TO SCORE WHEN 
THE WIRE ON TOP YOU COULD NOT FIND 
THE ONE HUNDRED SO WHEN YOU REALLY NEEDED 
IT 
THAT IS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IT WHEN YOU LAUGH L. THOUGHT WE MOVE 
THE BALL ROUND THE PITCH WELL IT 
WASN'T HAPPENING FOR US TODAY BUT 
THAT IS FOOTBALL ALICE SAVING 
PRAYER IS OUR LEAGUE CAMPAIGN WE 
HAVE GOT TO GET INTO THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE 
IF ALL SUSPICION THAT MILAN LEAGUE BAROS HANDLED THE BALL OUR 
SAVING PRAYER ANY SUSPICION NO NO HE GOT BOOKED FOR ONE TODAY BUT NO 
COMPLAINTS THEY ARE DEFENSIVE BE A 
VERY WELL SET UP TEAM THE 
EXPERIENCE THEY HAVE GOT AT THE 
BACK IS INVALUABLE AND WE FOUND 
THAT HARD TO BREAK THROUGH TODAY 
WE CAME OUT OF IT WITH CONFIDENCE 
AND BELIEF THAT WE CAN WIN SOME 
GAINS 
THAT IS THE BIGGER PICTURE GAINS YOU HAVE ACQUITTED YOURSELF WELL 
AGAINST THE SORT OF TEENY HOPE TO 
BE PLAYING NEXT YEAR 
THEY ARE A 
TEAM THAT A SIXTH IN THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE TEAM YOU HOPE WE GAVE 
THEM A DECENT GAME TODAY 
SPORTING WORDS FROM TONY MOWBRAY 
THEIR MAIN TASK IS TO GET 
THEMSELVES BACK INTO THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE 
HE CAN BE HAPPY WITH THE LEAGUE WAY HIS PLAYERS PLAYED TODAY THEY 
ACQUITTED THEMSELVES VERY WELL AND 
IT IS A REALITY CHECK THEY HAVE 
GOT TO GET AUTOMATIC PROMOTION THE 
WAY THEY HAVE PLAYED TODAY YOU 
WOULD SAY THEY HAVE GOT A GAME IN 
HAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 
PREMIERSHIP AND THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
IT IS THE SAME THING YOU HAVE GOT 
TO PICK YOURSELF UP QUICKLY 
DIFFICULT AFTER THIS SORT OF 
DISAPPOINTMENT 
THEIR MAIN PRIORITY DISAPPOINTMENT IS PROMOTION WHATEVER HAS HAPPENED 
IN THE F. A. CUP FOR THEM ALTHOUGH 
THIS IS VERY HARD TO TAKE UP A 
MINOR HAS BEEN A BONUS AND AN 
EXPERIENCE FOR THEM BUT IT IS BACK 
DOWN TO WORK ON TUESDAY IT IS NOT 
AS IF THEY ARE FINISHING MID TABLE 
IT IS A BIG TEST FOR HIM AS A 
MANAGER TUESDAY NIGHT BLACKPOOL 
AWAY THEY ARE ALL DOWN HE WILL 
HAVE TO LEAVE THE DRESSING ROOM 
AGAINST TEAMS LIKE ARSENAL AND 
LIVERPOOL WHO ARE CURRENTLY 
PLAYING AT THE EMIRATES 
IT IS ONE TO ONE 
PLAYING AT THE EMIRATES IT IS ONE TO ONE 
AGAIN OF TWO HALVES 
THAT IS WHAT IT IS PETER CROUCH 
JUST BEFORE HALF TIME FOR LIVERPOOL 
WHO DOMINATED THE FIRST FORTY FIVE MINUTES 
ARSENAL WERE MORE PURPOSEFUL IN THE 
SECOND HALF AND NICKLAS BENDTNER 
WITH HEADED EQUALISER AFTER A 
FOUL BY JERMAINE PENNANT LIVERPOOL 
HAVE SENT ON STEVEN GERRARD BUT 
LIVERPOOL MAKES EIGHT CHANGES THIS 
RESULT WILL PROBABLY PLEASE CHELSEA 
AND MANCHESTER UNITED MORE THAN 
EITHER OF THESE TEAMS 
THERE WAS A PICTURE OF THE EIGHTEENTH 
HOLE AT AUGUSTA 
IN SO MANY THE 
MASTERS WILL ALSO BE ON THE B. B. C. 
LATER THIS WEEK BUT LOOKING BACK 
HERE A HUGE DAY FOR PORTSMOUTH 
INCIDENTALLY 
IT IS A FABULOUS DAY INCIDENTALLY FOR HARRY REDKNAPP HE HAS BEEN IN 
THE GAME FOR A LONG TIME THEY 
DIDN'T PLAY PARTICULARLY WELL BUT I 
THINK HE HAS DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB 
AS I SAID WHERE HE HAS TAKEN THE 
TEAM TO COME UP ON PAPER THEY LOOK 
A REALLY GOOD SIDE 
A BIG DAY OUT 
FOR PORTSMOUTH 
I THINK THE NEUTRAL 
WOULD HAVE WANTED THE UNDERDOG TO 
WIN BUT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IS 
SAD THAT HARRY REDKNAPP HAS GOT A 
FINAL AT LAST 
IT WASN'T A GREAT 
SPECTACLE BUT PORTSMOUTH I THINK 
PROBABLY JUST DESERVED TO GET 
THROUGH 
PORTSMOUTH ARE COMING BACK THROUGH TO WEMBLEY FOR ONCE THE 
FAVOURITES HAVE WON IT CAN YOU 
BELIEVE IT GOODBYE DAVID JAMES HAS FUMBLED THAT A GOAL PORTSMOUTH HAVE REACHED THE F. A.
