FLEXIBLE WORKING GOOD NEWS FOR 
PARENTS OR A NIGHTMARE FOR 
COMPANIES THAT'S A QUESTION BEING 
ASKED TONIGHT AFTER THE GOVERNMENT 
SAID IT WOULD EXTEND THE SCHEME TO 
ALL CHILDREN AGED ALL PARENTS OF 
CHILDREN AGED UNDER SIXTEEN 
THE WORKING DAY IS CHANGING FOURTEEN 
MILLION NOW HAVE FLEXIBLE HOURS 
INCLUDING JOB SHARES COMPRESSED 
HOURS AND PART TIME WORKING WE ARE 
NO LONGER A NATION OF NINETY FIVE PARENTS 
OF YOUNGSTERS UNDER SIX OF 
DISABLED CHILDREN UNDER EIGHTEEN AND 
ADULT CARERS HAVE HAD THE RIGHT TO 
FLEXIBLE WORKING FOR SOME YEARS 
THIS GIRL IS MOTHER TO A TEN YEAR 
OLD IT HAS BEEN AGREED SHE WORKS NINE 
AM UP TO TWO THIRTY P. M. 
IF I DID NOT HAVE 
THESE HOURS I WOULD STILL BE ON 
BENEFITS AND DOING NOTHING BUT NOW 
I CAN COME TO WORK AND HAVE TIME 
WITH MY SON IN THE EVENING BY BY CHANGING THE RULES TO INCLUDE 
PARENTS OF CHILDREN UP TO SIXTEEN AN 
EXTRA FORTY FIVE MILLION WORKERS WILL BE 
ENTITLED TO ASK TO CHANGE THEIR

REASON FIRMS CAN SAY NO SYLVIA IS 
A BUSINESSWOMAN SHE EMPLOYS EIGHT 
PEOPLE 
IT IS NOT THAT FAR PEOPLE RESEARCH SUGGESTS SMALLER COMPANIES 
ARE MORE LIKELY TO SAY YES TO 
FLEXIBLE WORKING STILL THERE ARE 
SOME CONCERNS 
ANY MANDATORY 
RULINGS FROM PARLIAMENT ARE A JOKE 
WHEN IT COMES TO TELLING EMPLOYERS 
WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO TO ACCOMMODATE 
EMPLOYEES BECAUSE THEY SAY YOU 
DON'T HAVE TO DO IT BUT HAVE YOU 
EVER TRIED SALINE NO TWO AND EMPLOYED 
THE IT IS WORSE THAN HAVING 
CHILDREN TRIED SALINE NO TO AN 
EMPLOYEE YOU FOR NINETY PER CENT OF REQUESTS 
ARE AGREED 
BOSSES SAY WHAT IS GOOD 
FOR STAFF IS ALSO GOOD FOR BUSINESS 
OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT THE CHINESE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS THE EARTHQUAKE 
DEATH TOLL IS HEADING TOWARDS 
FIFTY THOUSAND FIFTY THOUSAND COMING UP HOW THIS TEENAGER IS 
MAKING AMENDS AFTER THE TWENTY THOUSAND 
OPERATION TO RESCUE HIM 
LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON NEW MAYOR 
BORIS JOHNSON SERVES UP HIS VISION 
FOR THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OLYMPICS 
AND THE TEAMS OF TWITCHERS ON A 
WILDLIFE CHASE ACROSS THE CAPITAL 
USING ONLY PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
THE CRIME COMMITTED BY GIRLS IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES HAS GONE UP BY 
MORE THAN A QUARTER OVER THE LAST 
THREE YEARS THE YOUTH JUSTICE 
BOARD SAYS LABOUR IS COMMITTED 
ALMOST SIXTY THOUSAND CRIMES INCLUDING 
THEFT CRIMINAL DAMAGE AND VIOLENCE 
THE REPORT ALSO SAID THE NUMBER OF 
CRIMES COMMITTED BY BOYS FELL 
SLIGHTLY HERE IS OUR HOME EDITOR 
AT FIRST SIGHT THE FIGURES SUGGEST 
THE BEHAVIOUR OF GIRLS HAVE 
SUDDENLY GOT MUCH WORSE A TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
INCREASE IN OFFENCES RECORDED BY 
POLICE A FIFTY FIVE A FIFTY PER CENT INCREASE IN 
THE NUMBER OF VIOLENT OFFENCES 
RECORDED BUT AT THE SAME TIME 
OFFENCES BY BOYS FELL BY TWO PER CENT AND 
YEAR ON YEAR OVERALL YOUTH CRIME 
WAS DOWN AT TWO PER CENT SO WHAT IS GOING 
ON ON BEING ONE OF THE LADS IS NO LONGER 
THE SOLE PRESERVE OF BOYS HAVE 
MORE FIFTEEN YEAR OLD GIRLS ARE GETTING 
DRUG REGULARLY THAN THEIR MALE 
COUNTERPARTS THREE OUT OF TEN GIRLS 
SAID THEY HAD BEEN BINGE DRINKING 
AT LEAST THREE TIMES IN THE 
PREVIOUS MONTH AGGRESSIVE 
BEHAVIOUR EASILY LEADS TO TROUBLE 
AND WITH POLICE TARGETS TO BRING 
MORE OFFENCES TO JUSTICE IT IS NO 
SURPRISE THAT MORE YOUNG WOMEN ARE 
BEING PROSECUTED 
IN THE PAST WE 
HAVEN'T SEEN GIRLS SIGNIFICANTLY 
INVOLVED IN CRIME RECENTLY WE 
HAVE AND STEALING THINGS LIKE 
COSMETICS AND MAKE UP AND IT SEEMS 
A TERRIBLE WASTE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 
TO ENTER THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
SYSTEM GET A RECORD FOR STEALING 
THINGS LIKE THAT 
WHAT WE MIGHT 
ONCE HAVE CALLED MR. GEOFF TODAY WE 
LABEL CRIME MISCHIEF A CAT 
FIGHT BETWEEN SCHOOLGIRLS SAW THIS 
GIRL CONVICTED OF COMMON ASSAULT 
AGED FIFTEEN IN ANOTHER IT DAY SHE 
MIGHT HAVE GOT DETENTION THESE 
DAYS IT IS A CRIMINAL RECORD I I WANTED TO CRY I HAD NEVER BEEN IN 
TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE L. WAS NOT 
BROUGHT UP TO BE AROUND CRIME AND 
THOSE SORT OF THINGS SO I WAS 
DEVASTATED THE MOST THING ON MY 
MIND WAS MY MUM BECAUSE OF MY MUM 
DID NOT BRING HER CHILDREN UP TO BE 
LIKE THAT 
IF YOU BRING CHILDREN 
INTO A MORE FORMALISED YOUTH 
JUSTICE SYSTEM IT IS HARDER TO GET 
THEM OUT SO IF WE DON'T WANT TO SEE 
GIRLS FEEDING THROUGH LATER IT IS 
BEST TO DIVERT THEM AT AN EARLY AGE 
ESPECIALLY FOR OFFENCES THAT ARE 
NOT SERIOUS THAT COULD BE DEALT 
WITH IN OTHER WAYS PERHAPS 
TO PUT 
TODAY'S FIGURES IN SOME PERSPECTIVE 
THERE ARE STILL TEN TIMES AS MANY 
BOYS AND GIRLS IN CUSTODY AND IN 
THE WHOLE OF ENGLAND AND WALES THE 
NUMBER OF GIRLS BEHIND BARS TONIGHT 
IS LIKELY TO BE AROUND TWO HUNDRED GIRLS 
BEHAVE IS UNDOUBTEDLY CHANGING BUT 
SO PERHAPS IS SOCIETY'S TOLERANCE 
BEHAVIOUR BEHAVIOUR HUNDREDS OF CELTIC FANS MADE THEIR 
WAY TO THE GROUND TODAY TO PAY 
TRIBUTE TO THE FORMER MANAGER AND 
PLAYER TOMMY BURNS WHO DIED FROM 
SKIN CANCER AT FIFTY ONE THE CLUB

NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE HE WAS A FAVOURITE OF THE 
FANS AND MANAGED KILMARNOCK AND 
READING AND HELPED GUIDE THE 
NATIONAL TEAM ALONGSIDE BERTI VOGTS
