WHETHER IT'S THE ADDICTION OF THE SPICES 
THE TINGLING SENSATION OF THE SAUCE OR JUST THE AROMA OF FLAVOURS 
BRITAIN'S INFATUATION WITH THE CURRY DOMINATES THE NATION'S DINING EXPERIENCE 
THERE ARE TODAY NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CURRY HOUSES THROUGHOUT THE U. K. 
ENOUGH TO SATE ANY APPETITE 
I'M RAVINDER BHOGAL A COOKAHOLIC PASSIONATE ABOUT FOOD 
OR AS I LIKE TO PUT IT A FOOD PERVERT 
FOR ME INDIAN FOOD HAS BEEN PART AND PARCEL OF MY LIFE 
WHO'S HUNGRY 
GROWING UP IN KENYA I HAD PLENTY BUT WHEN I MOVED HERE IN THE EIGHTIES 
LITTLE DID I REALISE WAS A PHENOMENA IT WAS ABOUT TO BECOME 
THE CURRY HOUSE HAS NOW BECOME A FAMILIAR PART OF VIRTUALLY EVERY MAJOR CITY LANDSCAPE 
I'M ON A MISSION TO FIND OUT HOW A COUNTRY KNOWN FOR ITS LOVE OF BLAND FOOD 
CAME TO FALL IN LOVE WITH THE HUMBLE CURRY 
MY JOURNEY SO FAR HAS TAKEN ME FROM SOUTHALL IN WEST LONDON 
WAIT FOR IT 
TO BRICK LANE IN EAST LONDON 
CHICKEN CURRY AND RICE VERY VERY NICE 
ORIGINAL CURRY AND RICE VERY VERY NICE 
I'VE TRIED COOKING A BALTI IN BIRMINGHAM 
OOH I'M ON FIRE 
AND EVEN SHARED A GUJARATI LUNCH IN LEICESTER 
NOW I'M TRAVELLING UP NORTH TO HEAR THE STORIES OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BROUGHT THE DISTINCT FLAVOURS 
OF THE SUBCONTINENT TO BRITAIN 
THIS IS MY PERSONAL JOURNEY OF THE U. K. CURRY TRAIL 
AND MY QUEST TO DISCOVER HOW A SIMPLE DISH FROM SOUTH ASIA 
HAS MANAGED TO SEDUCE THE TASTE BUDS OF AN ENTIRE NATION 
MANCHESTER A CITY FAMOUS FOR FOOTBALL CORONATION STREET 
TAKE THAT AND OF COURSE THE CURRY MILE 
GLITZY VIBRANT AND POSITIVELY BRIMMING WITH THE SMELL OF SPICE 
WELCOME TO MANCHESTER'S WILMSLOW ROAD 
FROM HAVING JUST A HANDFUL OF RESTAURANTS IN THE SEVENTIES 
IT TODAY HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS OF CURRY HOUSES IN THE U. K. 
THERE ARE OVER SEVENTY OF THEM ALL ALONG THIS ONE BRIGHTLY LIT NEON STRETCH 
MOST ARE PAKISTANI OWNED BUT THERE'S A REAL MIXTURE OF BANGLADESHI INDIAN 
AND MOST RECENTLY TURKISH FLAVOURS TOO 
OPEN VIRTUALLY TWENTY FOUR SEVENTHS THE MILE COMES TO LIFE AT NIGHT 
BUT DAYTIME ISN'T ANY LESS CROWDED 
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME HERE AND I'M IMPRESSED 
THERE'S SEEMS TO A PLACE TO SUIT EVERY TASTE AND OCCASION 
THIS REALLY IS A CURRY LOVER'S PARADISE 
JUST STANDING HERE YOU MIGHT GET A SENSE OF THE ENERGY OF THE CURRY MILE 
ANYBODY WHO LIVES IN MANCHESTER WHO WORKS IN MANCHESTER 
THIS KIND OF SEEPS INTO YOUR BLOOD 
WRITER AND POET ZAHID HUSSAIN HAS LIVED IN MANCHESTER FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS 
HIS DEBUT NOVEL THE CURRY MILE IS SET AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE CUT THROAT RESTAURANT TRADE 
I'D SAY THAT WHAT I WANTED TO GIVE WAS THE ESSENCE OF THE MILE 
WHICH PERHAPS I WOULDN'T USE THE WORD COMPETITIVE BUT I'D SAY DYNAMIC 
THERE WASN'T SOMEBODY WHO MADE A MASTERPLAN FOR MANCHESTER AND SAID 
WE WANT THIS NUMBER OF RESTAURANTS 
IT DIDN'T WORK LIKE THAT 
WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T OPEN A RESTAURANT HERE THEY JUST GO TO ANOTHER PART OF MANCHESTER 
BUT THEY ALWAYS TRY HERE FIRST WHY IS THAT WHAT'S THE DRAW HERE 
WELL HERE EVERY WEEK YOU GET ABOUT SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND PUNTERS 
MY GOODNESS 
THAT'S THE SORT OF KIND OF NUMBER OF STUDENTS AND PEOPLE WHO LIVE LOCALLY 
AND PEOPLE COMING FROM OUTSIDE MANCHESTER 
EVEN IF YOU JUST OPEN A RESTAURANT AND YOU'RE TRYING TO ESTABLISH YOURSELF YOU'LL MAKE MONEY 
ONE PERSON WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT STARTING A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS HERE IS MUKHTAR AHMED 
TWENTY YEARS AGO HE OPENED SANGAM A POPULAR HAUNT FOR LOCALS 
AND CELEBRITIES 
THIS IS WHERE THEY USED TO SIT 
TAKE THAT WOW 
THEY USED TO SIT HERE REGULARLY ALL THE TIME 
AND THEY ALWAYS HAD THEIR FAVOURITE SEATS THIS WAS THEIR 
WHERE DID ROBBIE SIT 
HE USED TO SIT ON THIS THIS ONE HERE CAN I GO AND HAVE A SEAT THERE YES OF COURSE 
THANKS I JUST WANT TO TRY IT OUT 
THIS IS THE CLOSEST I WILL PROBABLY GET TO SITTING ON ROBBIE'S LAP 
FOR MUKHTAR THE POPULARITY OF THE CURRY HAS BEEN FINANCIALLY REWARDING 
BUT SUCCESS HASN'T COME EASY 
WITH SO MANY RESTAURANTS NOW VYING FOR TRADE COMPETITION IS FIERCE 
TO SURVIVE ON WILMSLOW ROAD YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO WORK VERY HARD 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE 
BUT THE PEOPLE WHO NOW HAVE THE RESTAURANTS THE MAJORITY OF THEM THEY'VE BEEN HERE A LONG TIME YEAH 
BEING HERE FOR SUCH A LONG TIME YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE 
AND YOU HAVE TO WORK VERY HARD DAY IN DAY OUT 
HOW MANY HOURS DO YOU DO HERE THEN 
FOR TWENTY YEARS I'VE BEEN WORKING TWELVE HOURS A DAY 
THAT'S INCREDIBLE 
IT'S HARD HARD WORK 
ALL MY QUALITY TIME HAS GONE INTO THIS AND THAT'S WHY I'VE ACHIEVED SO MUCH 
ALTHOUGH RESTAURANTS IN THE MILE FIRST SET OUT TO ATTRACT LOCAL ENGLISH CUSTOMERS 
THINGS ARE CHANGING 
TEN YEARS AGO I WOULD SAY THERE WAS MUCH MORE NON ASIAN 
AND NOW THERE'S A VERY VERY GOOD MIX 
THIS IS THE ACTUAL INTEGRATION OF THE ASIAN COMMUNITY INTO WESTERN COMMUNITY UH HUH 
WHERE ONCE YOU JUST SAT AT HOME AND YOU HAD UMMI'S FOOD THAT'S NO LONGER JUST THE CASE 
AND DO YOU THINK THAT'S TO DO WITH GREATER AFFLUENCE WITHIN THE ASIAN COMMUNITY ABSOLUTELY 
AFFLUENCE BUT ALSO EXPECTATIONS THE WAY OF LIFE HAS CHANGED 
BUT THERE'S MORE TO MANCHESTER'S CURRY SCENE THAN JUST THE INFAMOUS MILE 
ALSO POPULAR ARE THE LEGENDARY CURRY CAFES 
TUCKED AWAY IN THE BACK STREETS OF THE CITY CENTRE 
RUMOUR HAS IT THEY'RE MANCHESTER'S BEST KEPT SECRET 
THE PROBLEM IS SOME OF THEM ARE SO TUCKED AWAY THEY CAN'T EVEN BE FOUND 
DO YOU KNOW WHERE SOAP STREET IS 
NO SORRY OH O. K. COOL 
UM 
NO ONE SEEM TO KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE HOW STRANGE 
HERE WE COME WHAT A STRANGE PLACE TO HAVE A RESTAURANT 
HOW DO I GET IN 
AH 
I'M HOPING THIS IS IT 
IT'S INCREDIBLE IT'S SO TUCKED AWAY 
HELLO HIYA SALAAM 
WHICH ONE OF YOU CHARMING CHAPS IS MR. MALLU MAINE 
HELLO MR. MALLU NICE TO MEET YOU NICE TO MEET YOU 
ISMAIL MALLU HAS BEEN RUNNING THIS AND THAT FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS 
LITTLE HAS CHANGED SINCE INCLUDING THE MENU 
FOR UNDER A FIVER YOU CAN HAVE RICE WITH A SELECTION OF TEN CURRIES WHICH CHANGE DAILY 
ON THE MENU TODAY 
THIS IS LAMB AND SPINACH YUP CHICKEN YUP 
ER THIS IS FISH UH HUH 
AND THIS IS LAMB AND TURNIPS WOW TURNIPS 
LAMB AND TURNIPS THAT'S LOVELY 
UM THIS IS VEGETARIAN MIXED VEGETABLES ENGLISH AND INDIAN MIXED VEGETABLE WITH POTATOES 
THIS IS LAMB STEAKS BECAUSE THEY ARE SO POPULAR WE HAVE THEM TWICE A WEEK NOW MONDAYS AND WEDNESDAYS 
THE ORIGINAL CURRY CAFES WERE SET UP BACK IN THE FIFTIES TO SERVE ASIANS 
WHO WORKED IN THE LOCAL TEXTILE MILLS' 
THE MENU WAS BASIC OFTEN WITH JUST A FEW CURRIES 
BUT FOR THE LOWLY PAID WORKERS IT WAS CHEAP AND AFFORDABLE 
THE MILLS HAVE LONG GONE BUT THE CAFE CULTURE HAS CONTINUED 
ATTRACTING PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE 
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU WHY IT'S CALLED THIS AND THAT 
TELL ME BECAUSE 
I DIDN'T ASK YOU THAT 
SOME OF THE CUSTOMERS 
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DISHES ARE SO THEY SAY SOME OF THIS PLEASE SOME OF THIS AND SOME OF THAT 
THIS PLACE REMINDS ME OF A CANTEEN BUT A VERY SPECIAL ONE 
A PLACE WHERE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE KNOW COME TO 
I'VE BEEN COMING TO THIS PLACE SINCE I WAS PREGNANT I'VE GOT A TEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER 
I'M VEGETARIAN SO MY FAVOURITE CURRIES ARE HERE EVERYDAY THE THREE DIFFERENT VEGETARIAN CURRIES 
SO IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO EAT IF YOU'RE A VEGGIE 
I ACTUALLY HAD A CRAVING FOR THE SPINACH AND LAMB 
SO I'D BE COMING IN HERE ABOUT THREE TIMES A WEEK 
CURRY'S GOT TO BE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE FOODS I'D PUT CURRY NEAR THE TOP AS WELL 
DID YOU EVER IMAGINE THAT ENGLISH PEOPLE WOULD LOVE CURRY SO MUCH 
THAT'S IT'S NOW EVERYONE'S FAVOURITE 
NOT IN THE EARLY SIXTIES AND THE EARLY SEVENTIES 
COS EVEN THE NEIGHBOURS USED TO YOU KNOW MOAN WHEN THE ASIAN USED TO MOVE IN WITH THE ENGLISH PEOPLE 
THEY'D SAY WE'RE GONNA GET THE CURRY SMELL 
AND THE PEOPLE YOU GREW UP WITH WHAT WAS THEIR ATTITUDE YOU WERE SCHOOLED HERE WEREN'T YOU 
YEAH I WENT TO SCHOOL IN BOLTON YEAH 
A LOT OF FRIENDS WELL THEY DIDN'T REALLY LIKE TO SIT WITH ALL THE ASIAN LADS ME AS WELL 
THEY SAID SORRY BUT YOU SMELL OF GARLIC AND THIS THAT AND THE OTHER 
OH NO BUT THE SAME PEOPLE AFTER A FEW YEARS WHEN I WERE IN BUSINESS IN BOLTON 
COME FOR A REGULAR CURRY AND WE USED TO JOKE ABOUT IT 
REMEMBER ONE TIME WHEN YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SIT NEXT TO ME 
SO YOU'VE HAD THE LAST LAUGH THEN YES I HAD THE LAST LAUGH 
WE JOKE ABOUT IT BUT THEY'RE ALL RIGHT NOW YEAH 
ISMAIL MAY HAVE HAD THE LAST LAUGH BUT SUCH EXPERIENCES WERE COMMON FOR ASIANS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
POST WAR BRITAIN SAW A LARGE INFLUX OF INDIAN AND PAKISTANI IMMIGRANTS 
COMING INTO THE NORTHERN PART OF THE U. K. 
MANCHESTER WAS A POPULAR DESTINATION BUT SO TOO WAS BRADFORD JUST FORTY MILES AWAY 
MANY ARRIVED WITH JUST A SLIP OF PAPER WITH BRADFORD AND A RELATIVES ADDRESS WRITTEN ON IT 
THEY WOULD THEN WAIT UNTIL THEY SAW AN ASIAN FACE BEFORE ASKING THEM FOR DIRECTIONS 
THE LARGEST ASIAN COMMUNITY HERE ARE THE PAKISTANIS 
THE FIRST GENERATION OF SETTLERS SOUGHT TO WORK IN THE LOCAL MILLS 
BUT SOME VENTURED INTO BUSINESS AND OPENED CURRY CAFES 
LIKE IN MANCHESTER THEY TOO WERE AIMED AT THE LOCAL ASIAN WORKERS 
ONE OF THE FIRST TO OPEN WAS THE KASHMIR IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT 
IT WAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT 
A DIFFERENT RESTAURANT DIFFERENT PEOPLE 
DIFFERENT CUSTOMERS 
SO IT WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
SET UP BY MOHAMMED LATIF'S BROTHER THE KASHMIR HAS REMAINED IN THE SAME FAMILY EVER SINCE 
BACK THEN IT WAS JUST A SMALL CAFE IN THE BASEMENT WHERE MEN SOCIALISED OVER SOME SIMPLE HOME COOKED FOOD 
THERE WAS THREE DISHES 
ONE WAS A CHICKEN CURRY WITH BONE 
ANOTHER WAS 
A MEAT CURRY THAT WAS WITH THE BONE AS WELL 
VEGETABLE SO THAT WAS THE THREE DISHES WHEN WE STARTED 
SOON THE CHEAP CURRY AND LATE OPENING HOURS BEGAN ATTRACTING STUDENTS AND THE POST PUB CROWD 
THEY WERE NOT USED TO THIS FOOD IT WAS A NEW FOOD FOR THEM 
SO SOMETIMES THEY USED TO MAKE FUN OF THE FOOD 
YEAH HOW DID THEY DO THAT 
WELL 
WITH THE CHAPATI THEY USED THE THROW THE CHAPATIS AT EACH OTHER 
MAKING FUN OF THE CHAPATIS AND THE SHAPE OF THE CHAPATIS 
BECAUSE THEY THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO EAT IT 
WE DIDN'T USED TO PROVIDE FORKS OR SPOONS YEAH 
IS IT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING BACK TO YOUR RESTAURANT YES THEY'RE COMING BACK TO US 
NOW THEY ARE GRANDPARENTS AND THEY BRING THEIR FAMILIES WITH THEM 
THEIR GRANDCHILDREN WITH THEM 
WHAT'S WHAT'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM LIKE NOW 
THEY ARE VERY FRIENDLY THEY'RE VERY FRIENDLY 
THE KASHMIR'S PLAYED AN IMPORTANT PART IN PLANTING THE SEEDS OF BRADFORD'S CURRY SCENE 
FIFTY YEARS ON IT'S STILL GOING STRONG BUT THERE'S NOW A NEW GENERATION OF RESTAURATEURS EMERGING 
WHO HAVE NEW IDEAS AND NEW DREAMS 
MEET ASGHAR ALI INSPIRED BY HIS LATE FATHER 
HE OPENED HIS FIRST RESTAURANT THE LAHORE CAFE FOUR YEARS AGO 
MY FATHER'S RESTAURANT WAS JUST DOWN THE ROAD FROM HERE 
THIS WAS TRADITIONALLY THE CURRY CAPITAL AS THEY SAY 
YOU HAD LOTS OF CURRY HOUSES DOWN THIS ROAD AND JUST DOWN THE CORNER FROM THERE 
AND YOU HAD A LOT OF THE CLUBS THAT WERE BASED AROUND HERE 
AND OUR MAIN CUSTOMERS WERE PEOPLE WHO USED TO GO TO THE CLUBS 
AND THEN ON AN EVENING COME AND EAT AT THE RESTAURANTS 
SO IT WAS CLASSED AS A WEST END REALLY OH RIGHT 
MY FATHER'S OLD RESTAURANT WAS HERE 
IT USED TO BE CALLED MOONLIGHT 
AND IT'S QUITE IRONIC THE FACT THAT THE RESTAURANT THAT I'VE NOW GOT IS BASICALLY TWO DOORS AWAY FROM IT 
WAS THAT DELIBERATE NO IT WASN'T DELIBERATE IT JUST CAME UP 
ASGHAR'S DREAM PROJECT WAS A LOUNGE SLASH CAFE AIMED AT THE NEW AFFLUENT ASIANS 
WITH A MENU THAT NOT ONLY OFFERS CURRIES BUT ALSO PANINIS AND SCHOOL STYLE PUDDINGS 
HIS FATHER HOWEVER WAS TOTALLY AGAINST THE IDEA 
WHEN I FIRST WHEN TO MY FATHER AND SAID I WANT TO GET BACK INTO THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS 
HE GAVE ME A CLIP ROUND THE EAR AND SAID GET A JOB AND MAKE SURE IT'S WITH A BANK 
AND WHEN I DID OPEN THIS AND SHOWED HIM THE PLANS OF WHAT I WANTED TO DO 
HE REALLY THOUGHT I'D GONE OFF THE RAILS 
WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS HE OBJECTED TO 
WELL IT'S NATURAL FOR PARENTS TO UM 
WANT THEIR KIDS TO DO BETTER THAN WHAT THEY DID SO HE WAS SAYING I DID THAT 
I GOT INTO THAT BUSINESS COS I HAD TO I DIDN'T HAVE AN EDUCATION 
I'VE EDUCATED YOU YOU'VE GOT A DEGREE AND M. B. A. YOU SHOULD GO OUT AND WORK FOR AN ORGANISATION 
BECAUSE OF HIS EXPERIENCES IN BUSINESS FOR THE TWENTY THIRTY YEARS HE DID DO 
THERE WAS LOTS OF HARD WORK AND HE PROBABLY DIDN'T WANT MYSELF TO GO INTO THAT 
ASGHAR'S NEW STYLE CURRY HOUSE HAS PROVED TO BE A HIT 
BUT WITH SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE TURNING AWAY FROM THE INDUSTRY WHERE DOES ITS FUTURE LIE 
OVERALL I THINK THE CURRY MARKET IS QUITE EXCITING IN TERMS OF WHERE IT IS AT THE MOMENT 
WE'VE HAD THIS TRADITIONAL CURRY INDUSTRY FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS 
I THINK IF WE CAN GET THE YOUNGER GENERATION MORE EDUCATED 
THEN I THINK WE'LL GET LOTS MORE IDEAS AND REALLY RAISE THE STANDARDS 
AND HOPEFULLY COMPETE ON MORE OF A A MAJOR LEVEL WHICH I THINK 
IS THE REAL EXCITING THING FOR THE CURRY MARKET AS A WHOLE 
AND THE FACT THAT WE CAN EVOLVE INTO THIS NEW ERA AND THAT NEW ERA CAN TAKE US ANYWHERE 
BRADFORD IS A CITY STEEPED IN CURRY HISTORY 
WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT I'VE BEEN TO TWO RESTAURANTS 
WHOSE APPROACH TO THE CURRY BUSINESS COULDN'T BE MORE DIFFERENT 
THE KASHMIR REPRESENTS A PAST ON WHICH THE PRESENT IS BUILT 
WHILE ASGHAR'S VISION HOPES TO TAKE THE CURRY MARKET INTO THE NEXT GENERATION 
FOR THE NEXT LEG OF MY JOURNEY 
I'M HEADING UP TO NEWCASTLE ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER TYNE 
THAT GREAT NORTHERN CITY FAMOUS FOR THE BALTIC THE MILLENNIUM BRIDGE 
AND OF COURSE NEWCASTLE BROWN ALE 
BY DAY THE PLACE IS LIKE ANY OTHER MAJOR CITY 
FULL OF HUSTLE BUSTLE AND HISTORIC LANDMARKS 
BUT BY NIGHT THE CITY TRANSFORMS INTO PARTY CENTRAL 
NEWCASTLE IS RENOWNED FOR ITS VIBRANT NIGHTLIFE AND THE GEORDIES FOR THEIR LOVE OF A GOOD TIME 
AS THE CURRY IS SYNONYMOUS WITH BEER MACHOISM AND CHILLIES 
WHERE BETTER TO FIND ALL THREE THAN HERE AT THE CURRY CAPITAL RESTAURANT 
LOCAL LEGEND ABDUL LATIF ALSO KNOWN AS LORD OF HARPOLE 
A TITLE HE BOUGHT FOR FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED IS THE MAN BEHIND NEWCASTLE'S VERY OWN CURRY HELL CHALLENGE 
BILLED AS THE HOTTEST CURRY IN THE WORLD 
THE CURRY HELL IS MADE WITH THREE LADLES OF PURE DRIED CHILLIES AND A FEW BITS OF CHICKEN IF YOU'RE LUCKY 
THE CHALLENGE IS TO EITHER EAT IT ALL OR PAY UP FOR THE DISH 
LORD HARPOLE STARTED THE CURRY HELL CHALLENGE BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN 
TWENTY YEARS ON THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF TAKERS 
BUT THERE'S A DISCLAIMER ISSUED BEFORE EVERY CHALLENGE 
JUST IN CASE 
I'M SORRY TO SAY IF YOU DIE SOMEBODY HAS TO PAY FOR IT 
THAT'S O. K. JUST GIVE ME ONE OR TWO AND THEN TAKE IT BACK 
TAKE YOUR TIME AND DRINK ANYTHING YOU LIKE 
O. K. ALL RIGHT 
RING OF FIRE BY JOHNNY CASH 
LOVE IS A BURNING THING 
AND IT MAKES A FIERY RING 
HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY GET THROUGH IT 
WELL OVER THE YEARS WE DON'T MAKE THAT MUCH MONEY BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME WE HAVE TO CALL THE AMBULANCE 
REALLY YES WE HAVE TO 
YOU'VE HAD TO CALL AN AMBULANCE WHY BECAUSE PEOPLE FALL DOWN 
THEY GO INTO A SWOON SO I HAVE TO CALL THE AMBULANCE 
DO PEOPLE GET REALLY SICK FROM IT THEN 
SOMETIMES BUT MOST OF THE TIME WHEN THEY TRY THE CURRY HELL 
I NEVER SEE THEM COME BACK SO GOD KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM I HOPE THEY'RE O. K. 
WOULD YOU EVER TRY IT OR HAVE YOU EVER TRIED IT 
I'M STUPID BUT I'M NOT THAT STUPID 
WELL I'M READY TO GIVE IT A TRY 
BUT ONLY WITH SOME OTHER CURRY HELL VIRGINS 
SAFETY IN NUMBERS AS THEY SAY 
I FELL INTO A BURNING RING OF FIRE 
SO WHY WHAT'S THE ATTRACTION 
IT'S THE CURRY HELL IT'S THE PURE ADRENALIN OF THE CHILLI FIX 
IT'S THIS THING MEN I CAN HAVE THE HOTTEST CURRY IN THE WORLD 
IT'S LIKE HAVING A FANCY CAR I CAN HAVE TWENTY PINTS AND YOU CAN'T 
BUT IS IT MACHOISM OR IS IT JUST STUPID 
IT'S STUPID COS YOU FOLLOW THE DRINK 
WELL HERE GOES 
J. E. 
IT'S REALLY HOT 
OH SORRY IT'S REALLY HOT 
IT'S DELIGHTFUL 
THAT IS CERTAINLY AN ACQUIRED TASTE 
NOT ONE FOR ME 
I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA HOW PEOPLE CAN EAT THIS BUT ONE GUY WON'T BE PAYING FOR HIS DINNER TONIGHT 
WELL DONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU 
ANYONE WHO FINISHES THE DISH NOT ONLY GETS IT FOR FREE 
BUT IS ALSO CROWNED THE CURRY HELL WINNER 
YOU'VE FINISHED WELL DONE HOW DO YOU FEEL AFTER THAT 
MY FACE IS COMING BACK TO ME BUT 
IT'S NOT WORTH IT 
IT'S NOT WORTH IT IT'S HORRIBLE IT'S NOT FOOD 
IT'S THE SECOND TIME YOU'VE DONE IT SECOND TIME YEAH 
IF IT'S HORRIBLE WHY KEEP COMING BACK FOR MORE 
I WON'T BE BACK AGAIN REALLY ABSOLUTELY 
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT NOW YOU'VE EATEN IT NO 
WELL DONE THAT'S FANTASTIC 
DO YOU FEEL MORE THE MAN FOR HAVING DONE IT 
I SUPPOSE SO IN A WAY 
THERE'S PROBABLY NOT A MAJOR CITY IN THE U. K. WHICH DOESN'T HAVE ITS VERY OWN CURRY HOTSPOT 
IN MY QUEST TO DISCOVER WHAT MAKES THIS LOVE AFFAIR SO PASSIONATE 
THE FINAL DESTINATION IN MY JOURNEY BRINGS ME TO GLASGOW 
AND I'VE EVEN COME DRESSED FOR THE PART 
GLASGOW HAS THE LARGEST ASIAN COMMUNITY IN SCOTLAND 
NOT SURPRISINGLY IT ALSO HAS A THRIVING CURRY SCENE 
AND HAS WON THE CURRY CAPITAL TITLE MORE TIMES THAN ANYWHERE ELSE 
THREE TIMES IN FACT 
ONE OF ITS MOST POPULAR DISHES IS THE HAGGIS PAKORA 
CHOPPED HAGGIS COATED IN GRAM FLOUR AND OF COURSE DEEP FRIED 
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY GLASGOW ALSO CLAIMS TO BE THE CITY WHERE ANOTHER POPULAR DISH ORIGINATED 
THE CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA 
LEGEND HAS IT THAT THE DISH CAME ABOUT 
AFTER A CHEF IMPROVISED A DRY CURRY 
BY ADDING A SAUCE MADE FROM TOMATO SOUP YOGHURT AND SPICES 
THAT CHEF GLASWEGIANS ARGUE WAS WORKING IN AN INDIAN RESTAURANT IN THE CITY 
BUT COULD THIS JUST BE ANOTHER URBAN MYTH 
I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT WHERE CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA COMES FROM DO YOU KNOW 
UM 
YEAH INDIA 
I HEARD THAT CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA STARTED IN GLASGOW IS THAT RIGHT 
I HAVEN'T A CLUE DEAR I COULDN'T TELL YOU 
WHERE DO YOU THINK CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA COMES FROM 
ER CHICKENS 
INDIA 
INDIA 
ALL THE RECIPES ARE LIKE FROM INDIA AND PAKISTAN 
I THINK ACTUALLY IT'S BRITISH IS IT NOT 
AND WHERE IN BRITAIN DO YOU THINK IT STARTED DOWN SOUTH SOMEWHERE 
I THINK IT'S GLASGOW 
CURRY KING SANJAY MAJHU HEADS HARLEQUIN 
EUROPE'S LARGEST GROUP OF INDIAN RESTAURANTS 
HE THINKS IT'S GLASGOW TOO 
IT DEFINITELY ORIGINATED IN GLASGOW 
FROM THE PEOPLE I SPEAK TO 
SOME OF THE CHEFS I'VE WORKED WITH OVER THE YEARS 
WELL I'M SURE THE CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA DEBATE WILL KEEP US GUESSING FOR YEARS TO COME 
BUT SANJAY CLAIMS THE GLASWEGIANS HAVE NOW CREATED ANOTHER DISH THE CHASNI 
THE CHASNI IS A UNIQUE SWEET AND SOUR DISH MADE WITH LOTS OF CREAM 
AND WAIT FOR THIS MANGO CHUTNEY 
THE PERFECT CHICKEN CHASNI 
YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF FUSION COOKING AND HOW THE CURRY IS EVOLVING ALL THE TIME 
I'D LOVE TO TRY IT THIS IS THE PERK OF MY JOB ACTUALLY 
RIGHT 
TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF THE CHICKEN 
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HOT 
I'LL BLOW IT 
DO YOU LIKE THAT 
IT'S A REALLY UNUSUAL TASTING DISH 
I'VE NEVER TASTED ANYTHING QUITE LIKE IT YEAH 
YOU CAN REALLY TASTE THE MANGO CHUTNEY IT DOESN'T TASTE LIKE A VERY INDIAN DISH I HAVE TO SAY NO 
THE GLASWEGIANS EAT IT IN THEIR BUCKET LOADS 
CHICKEN TIKKA CHASNI IS THE NUMBER ONE SELLER 
MORE POPULAR THAN CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA 
WHICH IS INCREDIBLE I HOPE WE GET IT DOWN SOUTH TOO 
OH IT'S COMING 
IT WAS WHILE WORKING AS A WAITER IN HIS TEENS 
THAT SANJAY VOWED TO ONE DAY OPEN HIS OWN INDIAN RESTAURANT 
TODAY HE OWNS SEVENTEEN INCLUDING THE ONE WHERE HE USED TO WORK 
BACK THEN FOOD WASN'T THE ONLY THING THAT BROUGHT IN THE CUSTOMERS 
PEOPLE WOULD GO TO THE PUB GET THROWN OUT AT TEN P. M. 
AND GO TO THEIR LOCAL INDIAN RESTAURANT TO CONTINUE THE EVENING 
SO IT COULD GET ROUGH GLASSES WOULD FLY LADIES WOULD START FIGHTING 
PEOPLE WOULD BE SICK ON THE TABLE 
BUT THAT WAS ALL PART OF WORKING IN AN INDIAN RESTAURANT 
HOW'S THE EXPERIENCE OF GOING OUT FOR A CURRY CHANGED 
IN THE OLD DAYS INDIAN RESTAURANTS LOOKED LIKE INDIAN RESTAURANTS 
WITH THE FLOCK WALLPAPER YEAH STAFF DRESSED UP WITH BOW TIES 
LOOKING VERY INDIAN 
UM THAT WAS A DIFFERENT ERA 
NOWADAYS WHAT YOU SEE IS PEOPLE DESIGNING RESTAURANTS DIFFERENTLY 
SO IT'S NOT PART OF THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE OF FEELING INDIA 
COS PEOPLE EAT THE FOOD EVERY DAY SO IT'S JUST ABOUT COMFORTABLE SURROUNDINGS 
AND IF YOU CAN THROW IN A BIT OF INDIA THAT HELPS A LOT 
WITH THIS SHIFT IN ATTITUDE ENTREPRENEURS LIKE SANJAY 
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE THE DINING EXPERIENCE TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL 
TODAY GLASGOW IS HOME TO SOME OF THE MOST UPMARKET INDIAN RESTAURANTS IN THE COUNTRY 
MONIR MOHAMMED OWNS FIVE ALL IN THE CITY CENTRE 
EACH HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE STYLE AND AMBIENCE 
THIS ONE'S MY PERSONAL FAVOURITE 
ALL THE RESTAURANTS HAVE DELIBERATELY MOVED AWAY 
FROM THE INDIAN THEME AND ARE WORLDS APART FROM THE CURRY HOUSES HE ONCE WORKED IN 
BUT MONIR BELIEVES THIS FAD WILL DIE OUT AND THE TRADITIONAL LOOK 
INCLUDING FLOCKED WALLPAPER WILL MAKE A COME BACK 
IN FACT HE'S SO CONVINCED HE'S EVEN DEDICATED A WALL IN ONE OF HIS RESTAURANTS TO IT 
I LOVE HOW YOU'VE USED THE WALLPAPER HERE 
I THINK DESIGN IS CYCLES 
IT GOES BACK TO THE RESTAURANTS TERMED MODERN IN THE EIGHTIES NINETIES 
ONE DAY PEOPLE WILL OPEN A RESTAURANT THAT GOES BACK TO HOW IT WAS IN THE SEVENTIES 
SO THIS IS JUST YOUR HINT TOWARDS RETRO YES 
I'D LIKE TO OPEN A RESTAURANT WHICH WAS BACK TO THE WAY IT USED TO BE 
SO A REALLY LOVELY RETROSPECTIVE RESTAURANT BUT WITH BETTER FOOD 
WHEN I FIRST STARTED WORKING I REMEMBER SERVING A LOT OF MADRAS OR VINDALOO DISHES YEAH 
THAT RARELY HAPPENS NOW 
NOBODY COMES IN FOR A VERY HOT CURRY 
THEY REALISE THERE'S NOT MUCH TASTE IN IT JUST SPICES DO YOU SERVE VINDALOOS TIKKA MASALAS NO 
WE DON'T SERVE TIKKA MASALA OR VINDALOOS 
HE MAY NOT DO THE OLD FAVOURITES BUT HERE AT MOTHER INDIA'S CAFE 
MONIR'S INTRODUCED AN ALTERNATIVE STYLE OF EATING 
WELL HERE WE DO MOSTLY TAPAS DISHES SMALLER DISHES 
TAPAS THAT'S QUITE A NEW CONCEPT FOR INDIAN FOOD 
YES IT HAS WORKED VERY POPULAR I THINK FOR PEOPLE TO TRY 
DIFFERENT KINDS OF DISHES THAT THEY WOULD PROBABLY NEVER TRY IN AN A LA CARTE RESTAURANT 
TAPAS STYLE DISHES ARE JUST ONE EXAMPLE 
OF HOW THIS CUISINE IS FORGING AHEAD TO MEET NEW CUSTOMER DEMANDS 
FROM CHEAP CAFES TO FINE DINING ITS REPUTATION'S TRANSFORMED BEYOND BELIEF 
WITH SIMILAR NEW TRENDS EMERGING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WHAT'S NEXT FOR THIS HUMBLE DISH 
PEOPLE LOOK AT MORE AUTHENTIC FOOD 
BUT ALSO NOW WITH A LOT OF T. V. COVERAGE OF FOOD AS A WHOLE 
PRESENTATION WILL BECOME EVERYTHING 
SO YOU'RE NOT JUST GOING TO SEE A NAAN BREAD LAID ON A FISH PLATE 
OR CURRIES COMING IN BIG KARAHIS 
THEY'LL START TO PLATE THE FOOD A BIT MORE 
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE HORRIBLE BIG TOWERS BITS OF OLIVE OIL THROWN OVER IT WITH FRIED SPRING ONION 
AND A TOMATO OR A CARROT CUT INTO A DUCK 
DO YOU THINK IT WILL REMAIN AS POPULAR AS IT IS NOW ABSOLUTELY 
I STILL THINK CURRY'S THE NUMBER ONE FOOD AND FOR A LONG TIME 
IT WILL RETAIN THAT STATUS NOTHING CAN COME CLOSE 
I'VE COME TO THE END OF MY CURRY TOUR 
AND WHAT A JOURNEY IT'S BEEN 
I HAVE TO BE HONEST I USED TO BE A BIT OF A SCEPTIC WHEN IT CAME TO CURRY HOUSES 
JUST BECAUSE IT DIDN'T CORRELATE WITH WHAT MY MOTHER COOKED AT HOME 
I TURNED MY NOSE UP AT IT I WAS ALWAYS A BIT OF A PURIST 
BUT I'VE DISCOVERED THAT THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO THE BRITISH INDIAN RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE 
THAN CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA 
WHAT YOU EAT IN LEICESTER IS SO DIFFERENT FROM BRICK LANE 
WHICH IS DIFFERENT AGAIN TO WHAT YOU'LL EAT IN BRADFORD 
THERE REALLY SEEMS TO BE A GENUINE DRIVE 
TOWARDS BRINGING ACROSS THE REGIONAL FLAVOURS OF THE SUBCONTINENT 
WHILST ALSO INTRODUCING NEW DISHES WITH A BRITISH SLASH ASIAN STAMP 
AND HEARING PEOPLE'S STORIES OF THEIR HARD WORK AND DETERMINATION 
PROVES WHAT AN IMPORTANT PART THE CURRY HAS PLAYED IN BREAKING DOWN CULTURAL BARRIERS 
THEY'VE REALLY USED FOOD TO MAKE A PLACE FOR THEMSELVES HERE 
AND THEY'VE SEDUCED THE NATION WITH THEIR CURRIES 
TODAY THE CURRY IS AS MUCH BRITISH AS IT IS ASIAN 
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS IT'S HERE TO STAY
