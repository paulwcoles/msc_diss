THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS SOME STRONG LANGUAGE 
CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING TO THE CAMERA JUST BECAUSE I KNOW I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SAY IT 
UM 
I JUST WANTED TO SAY DAD IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS 
YES I AM A STRIPPER 
AND I KNOW IT'S NOT THE IDEAL WAY TO FIND OUT 
BUT YOU ALWAYS USED TO TELL ME A JOB'S A JOB 
AS LONG AS YOU'RE SUPPORTING YOUR FAMILY AND THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING 
DON'T FORGET I'M STILL DOING A DEGREE 
SO PLEASE DON'T BE ASHAMED OF ME THANK YOU BYE 
THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS SOME STRONG LANGUAGE 
AMY HALL IS NINETEEN 
HER DAUGHTER MIA IS FIFTEEN MONTHS OLD 
AMY'S A SINGLE MUM A STUDENT AND A LAP DANCER 
SHE HOPES THE MONEY SHE EARNS FROM LAP DANCING 
WILL HELP PAY FOR HER EDUCATION AND FOR MIA'S CHILDCARE 
SHE'S GETTING READY TO PRACTICE ON THE POLE SHE'S INSTALLED IN HER LIVING ROOM 
BUT IT'S NOT EASY WHEN A DEMANDING TODDLER'S IN TOW 
YURGH OH 
OH YOU STINK 
FIVE YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE CRIED IF I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE DOING THIS' 
THEN AGAIN FIVE YEARS AGO I WAS ONLY FOURTEEN 
AMY LEFT HOME AT SIXTEEN AND BECAME PREGNANT A YEAR LATER 
MIA 
I'M NOT LETTING YOU GO YOU'LL ONLY WEE ON THE FLOOR 
RIGHT FINE DON'T HAVE A NAPPY ON 
I TALK ABOUT MIA ALL THE TIME TO ANYBODY THAT'LL LISTEN 
IT DOESN'T PUT CLIENTS OFF I WOULD SAY IT DOES THE OPPOSITE 
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE CLIENTS LOOK AT ME AND THINK I'M QUITE YOUNG 
HAVING A CHILD MEANS SORT OF 
IT'S O. K. AND I'M NOT A CHILD MYSELF 
BUT EVERY SINGLE ONE SAYS THAT I SHOULDN'T BE THERE 
WHICH SOMETIMES UPSETS ME 
AND SOMETIMES IT MAKES ME FEEL GLAD THAT THEY SAY THAT 
THEY SAY THAT I'M TOO YOUNG AND TOO INTELLIGENT 
AND THAT I SHOULD GET ANOTHER JOB 
AND OFFER TO TAKE ME AWAY LIKE THIS DAMSEL IN DISTRESS 
AMY STARTED LAP DANCING IN THE SECOND YEAR OF HER DEGREE COURSE 
WHEN SHE REALISED HER DEBTS WERE MOUNTING 
I WAS VERY SCARED WHEN I FIRST STARTED LAP DANCING VERY NERVOUS 
BUT THEN I WAS INTRODUCED TO SOMETHING CALLED ALCOHOL 
AND I WAS FINE 
IT'S BEEN A VERY LOVING RELATIONSHIP EVER SINCE 
I REMEMBER THE FIRST DANCE IT WAS A POSTMAN I THINK 
IT WAS VERY QUIET VERY ODD IT WAS LIKE FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON 
I GAVE HIM A DANCE AND I FORGOT TO TAKE MY UNDERWEAR OFF 
WHICH WAS A BIT EMBARRASSING BUT NEVER MIND 
SOME RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT A GROWING NUMBER OF STUDENTS 
WORK IN THE SEX INDUSTRY TO FUND THEIR STUDIES 
AMY'S ONE OF THE FEW WILLING TO TELL HER STORY 
WHEE 
BUT SHE IS WELL AWARE OF THE STIGMA ATTACHED TO SELLING HER BODY 
IF SOMEBODY ASKS ME WHAT I DO I DON'T SAY I'M A LAP DANCER 
I SAY I'M AN ACTRESS OR I DO MODELLING 
I WOULD SAY I'M A SINGLE MUM DOING ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING TO KEEP AFLOAT 
I'D SAY I'M TRYING 
AMY LIVES IN BIRMINGHAM SO THAT SHE CAN BE NEAR TO WORK 
IN ORDER TO GET TO COLLEGE 
SHE TRAVELS FORTY MILES NORTH TO BURTON ON TRENT 
AMY CAN'T AFFORD DAILY CHILDCARE IN BIRMINGHAM 
SO SHE HAS TO TAKE MIA TO THE COLLEGE CRECHE 
MIA COME ON 
IT'S A GRUELLING ROUTINE FOR MOTHER AND DAUGHTER 
IN THE MORNING I USUALLY GET UP ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK 
GET MIA READY GET MYSELF READY JUMP ON THE TRAIN 
DROP MIA OFF 
GO TO LESSON FALL ASLEEP IN LESSON GET TOLD OFF 
THAT'S A NORMAL MORNING FOR ME 
VERY FEW PEOPLE ON AMY'S COURSE KNOW SHE LAP DANCES 
HER TUTOR PETE GLOVER DOES 
WE TALKED TO HIM AT A LOCAL ARTS CENTRE 
IN HER PRACTICAL WORK AMY IS CONSISTENTLY GETTING HIGH TWENTY ONE FIRSTS 
SHE HAS GOT A GREAT DEAL OF TALENT 
SHE'S GOT SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT HER 
AND NOW SHE'S STARTING TO REALISE THAT AND STARTING TO VALUE THAT A LITTLE MORE 
AMY'S HALFWAY THROUGH A TWO YEAR FOUNDATION DEGREE IN PERFORMING ARTS 
A FULL HONOURS DEGREE NEXT YEAR 
AND A FUTURE CAREER AS AN ACTRESS 
AMY HAS A STUDENT LOAN RECEIVES A GRANT AND BURSARY 
BUT HAS ALREADY RUN UP DEBTS OF OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND 
SO SHE NEEDS A JOB THAT PAYS WELL 
IT'S SHORT HOURS AND POTENTIALLY I CAN EARN A LOT OF MONEY 
IF I WENT AND GOT ANOTHER JOB SAY IN A SUPERMARKET IN THE DAY 
I'D HAVE TO WORK A WHOLE WEEK TO GET WHAT I COULD POSSIBLY EARN IN ONE NIGHT 
WITHOUT DANCING I DON'T THINK I COULD PROVIDE FOR MY DAUGHTER 
I DON'T THINK I COULD EVEN DO UNIVERSITY 
IT'S MADE THINGS A LOT EASIER FINANCIALLY 
AMY WORKS AT THE LAP DANCING CLUB AT LEAST THREE NIGHTS A WEEK 
BUT THE LACK OF SLEEP IS TAKING ITS TOLL 
AND AMY'S COLLEGE WORK IS BEGINNING TO SUFFER 
HER TUTOR'S CONCERNED 
SHE'S BEEN ARRIVING AT COLLEGE MORE TIRED 
SHE'S GOT LESS TIME TO REHEARSE 
THAT IS A CONCERN TO ME 
I WISH SHE WAS COMING IN TALKING ABOUT THE NEXT PLAY SHE WAS DOING 
I CAN BE DANCING UNTIL ABOUT FOUR NOT GET TO BED UNTIL FIVE 
AND THEN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO MOTIVATE MYSELF THE NEXT DAY 
YOU KNOW WHO WANTS TO SIT AND DO A TWO THOUSAND WORD ESSAY 
WHEN THEY'VE HAD A FEW HOURS' SLEEP 
BACK FROM COLLEGE AMY HAS LITTLE MORE THAN AN HOUR 
BEFORE HEADING OUT TO WORK LEAVING MIA IN A FRIEND'S CARE 
BYE BYE 
BYE BYE NO NO IT'S COLD SWEETHEART 
IT'S COLD CLOSE THE DOOR 
GOOD GIRL BYE BYE 
AS SOON AS I LEAVE THE HOUSE I START THINKING OF WORK 
AND I TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT MIA TOO MUCH 
COS OBVIOUSLY IT'S GONNA PUT ME ON A BIT OF A DOWNER 
I'M NOT GOING TO GET DANCES OFF PEOPLE WITH A FACE LIKE A SLAPPED ARSE AM I 
SO I HAVE TO SORT OF PUT MYSELF IN A REALLY HAPPY MOOD 
I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE MIA'S CHILDCARE ALL PAID UP THIS WEEK 
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'LL DO THAT 
SO A LITTLE BIT WORRIED 
BUT MAYBE A MILLIONAIRE WILL COME IN AND TAKE A LIKING TO ME 
HERE WE GO 
HELLO 
HELLO AMY ALL RIGHT GOT YOUR FEE 
BEFORE AMY CAN EVEN START EARNING MONEY 
SHE HAS TO PAY THE CLUB A WEEKLY RETAINER OF FIFTEEN 
AND PAYS A FURTHER HOUSE FEE OF UP TO EIGHTY FIVE EVERY NIGHT SHE DANCES 
O. K. SORTED O. K. THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE CLUB ALSO DETERMINE HOW MUCH SHE CAN CHARGE 
THERE IS A SET FEE OF FIFTEEN FOR A DANCE 
FOR A V. I. P. WHICH IS LIKE HALF AN HOUR TO AN HOUR 
IT'S A LOT MORE 
AND YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH PUT YOUR OWN PRICE ON THAT 
BUT IT'S IN THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE FOR HALF AN HOUR AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOR AN HOUR 
IT'S NOT VERY OFTEN THAT YOU'LL GET SOMEONE IN THE V. I. P. 
WELL FOR ME ANYWAY I'M SURE OTHER GIRLS HAVE MORE LUCK BUT I DON'T 
HERE COMES AMY 
AMY'S NIGHT'S WORK BEGINS WITH A POLE DANCE 
BUT SHE DOESN'T GET PAID FOR THIS IT'S ONLY ADVERTISING 
SHE MAKES HER MONEY DANCING NAKED IN PRIVATE ONE TO ONE 
I'M VERY PROUD OF HOW I'VE PROGRESSED ON THE STAGE 
IN CONFIDENCE IN MY SKILL AND ABILITY 
BECAUSE I WAS COMPLETELY NEW TO IT COMPLETELY FRESH 
NOT REALLY A DANCER ONLY DONE A BIT OF JAZZ DANCE 
A BIT OF BALLROOM HARDLY THE SAME KIND OF THING 
BUT I'M REALLY PROUD NOW 
I GIVE ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT EVERY TIME I GO UP THERE 
MOST MEN WILL BE VERY POLITE 
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE THINKING BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SAY IT OUT LOUD 
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE AND DANCE FOR COMPLETE IDIOTS 
I WANNA DO YOU OR HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST FOR ME TO TAKE YOU OUT AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
BUT I JUST SWITCH OFF AND DISTANCE MYSELF FROM PEOPLE LIKE THAT 
I TRY THE INNOCENT APPROACH WITH MOST MEN 
SOMETIMES IT WORKS SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T 
GET QUITE A FEW COMPLIMENTS THEY ASK ME TO MARRY THEM 
I SAY I'M REALLY SORRY BUT I'M BUSY THIS WEEKEND 
A LOT OF MEN HAVE COMMENTED ON THE FACT THAT I AM YOUNG 
AND I DO FEEL TOO YOUNG SOMETIMES 
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO SOMEBODY THAT'S SIXTY YOU DO FEEL THE AGE GAP SLIGHTLY 
I THINK IT'S OPENED MY EYES A LOT TO THE WAY PEOPLE ACT 
WHEN THEY HAVE A BIT OF MONEY AND A BIT OF DRINK INSIDE THEM 
TONIGHT WASN'T A BRILLIANT NIGHT 
I DON'T THINK MANY OF THE GIRLS DID TOO WELL THOUGH 
SO I DON'T FEEL TOO BAD 
HOW MUCH DID YOU MAKE 
PROFIT 
I MADE 
FIFTEEN 
SO 
NOT REALLY GREAT AND PLUS ONE DRANK SOME OF THAT AS WELL 
NEVER MIND 
IT'S NOT A TYPICAL NIGHT'S WORK FIFTEEN 
BUT IT'S NOT UNUSUAL IT'S NOT UNHEARD OF 
YOU KNOW 
BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE THE ROUGH WITH THE SMOOTH I SUPPOSE 
HOME FROM WORK AMY CHECKS ON MIA BEFORE FINALLY GOING TO BED HERSELF 
NIGHT NIGHT SWEETHEART 
I JUST HOPE THAT ONE DAY 
MIA'LL UNDERSTAND 
SHE'LL UNDERSTAND 
WHY I HAD TO DO THIS 
AND HOPEFULLY I'LL BE IN A POSITION THEN 
TO HELP HER OUT FINANCIALLY 
HEY YOU NEVER KNOW 
AFTER ONLY A FEW HOURS SLEEP 
AMY HAS TO MAKE THE SWITCH BACK FROM LAP DANCER TO MUM 
HOW HUNGRY ARE YOU MIA MM 
DO YOU LIKE COOKING 
NO I HATE COOKING 
I REALLY HATE COOKING AND I'M REALLY BAD AT IT 
MIA'S NOT TWO YET 
AND AMY'S STILL DISCOVERING WHAT BEING A SINGLE MUM'S ALL ABOUT 
HAVING A FIFTEEN MONTH OLD DAUGHTER IS HARD WORK TO SAY THE LEAST 
SHE IS GOOD BUT SHE'S VERY DEMANDING 
BECAUSE I SPOILT HER WITH HER ATTENTION WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER 
SHE'S VERY ATTENTION SEEKING NOW 
AMY GETS SOME HELP LOOKING AFTER MIA FROM HER PARENTS AND MIA'S FATHER 
HE MAKES A CONTRIBUTION TO MIA'S WELFARE BUT THERE'S NO FORMAL ARRANGEMENT 
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT I WAS ENGAGED 
HE WAS THIRTEEN YEARS OLDER THAN ME IT WAS PLANNED 
HE WANTED A CHILD AND WE PLANNED TO GET MARRIED AND EVERYTHING 
BECAUSE HE WAS SO MUCH OLDER THAN ME 
HE WAS READY AND AT THAT STAGE IN HIS LIFE 
I SAID WHAT ABOUT MY EDUCATION 
HE SAID DON'T WORRY YOU CAN GO BACK AND I'LL LOOK AFTER THE CHILD 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY WHEN I HAD MIA WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN 
A FEW SHORT MONTHS AFTERWARDS IT BROKE DOWN 
SOMETHING SMELLS LIKE IT'S BURNING 
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S DONE 
WHAT ARE YOU EATING 
IT'S A CHICKEN 
IT LOOKS GOLDEN THAT'LL DO WON'T IT 
AS A FULL TIME MUM AMY'S CONSTANTLY JUGGLING THE DEMANDS MIA MAKES WITH THOSE OF HER COLLEGE 
I THINK I'VE GOT TWO ESSAYS ON THE GO AT THE MOMENT 
I'VE GOT A TWO THOUSAND WORD ESSAY WHICH IS GOING TO TAKE ME QUITE A FEW DAYS 
I AM FINDING IT HARD THIS WEEK HAS BEEN A VERY BUSY WEEK 
I WOULDN'T BE DOING A DEGREE NOW IF IT WASN'T FOR HER 
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T HAVE THE AMBITION OR THE DRIVE TO DO IT 
JUST A QUICK NAP EH MIA 
IT'S ME AND MIA AGAINST THE WORLD 
FINANCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY WE SUPPORT EACH OTHER 
I TELL HER ALL MY PROBLEMS AND SHE JUST GIVES ME A CUDDLE 
AND THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME 
IT MIGHT SOUND SAD 
BUT WE'RE GOING TO GROW UP AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ON THE WORLD 
AS THE WEEKS GO BY AMY'S STILL WORKING LONG HOURS 
AT THE LAP DANCING CLUB AND THINGS ARE BEGINNING TO GET ON TOP OF HER 
IT'S GETTING TO THE STAGE NOW WHERE I'M GETTING VERY TIRED 
AND COLLEGE IS GETTING A LOT MORE DEMANDING 
FOR INSTANCE I'VE GOT A REHEARSAL TOMORROW AND I'VE GOT TO BE UP FOR SEVEN 
OUT OF THE HOUSE FOR HALF SEVEN TO BE IN BURTON 
I DON'T WANT TO BECOME SOMEBODY WHO'S IN A BAD MOOD ALL THE TIME 
BECAUSE I'VE ONLY HAD A COUPLE OF HOURS SLEEP 
I DON'T WANT IT TO START AFFECTING MY PARENTING SKILLS 
I FEEL I'VE BEEN QUITE LUCKY SO FAR 
BUT I CAN'T TAKE THE MICKEY REALLY 
DOING THINGS LIKE ESSAYS 
I'VE NOT DONE ONE ESSAY YET 
AND I'M GOING TO BE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE IF I DON'T DO IT SOON 
IF IT'S QUIET TONIGHT I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS 
ABOUT WHETHER IT'S FINANCIALLY WORTH IT TO CARRY ON COMING HERE 
BECAUSE I'M WASTING AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY 
WHICH COULD BE SPENT CHASING MY DREAM SO TO SPEAK 
OVER THE PAST MONTH AMY HAS HAD SOME GOOD NIGHTS 
BUT A WORRYING NUMBER OF SLOW NIGHTS AT WORK 
SHE DOESN'T GET PAID FOR DANCING ON THE POLE 
AND ONLY MAKES MONEY WHEN SHE PERFORMS A PRIVATE STRIPTEASE 
AFTER PAYING THE NIGHTLY HOUSE FEE 
AMY NEEDS TO DO THIS SIX TIMES BEFORE MAKING A PROFIT 
I WOULDN'T SAY I'M PROUD OF WHAT I DO 
I'M PROUD OF THE WAY I'VE GONE ABOUT IT AND PROUD OF LEARNING THE TRADE 
IT'S TAKEN A LOT OF HOURS A LOT OF HARD WEEKS 
SO I'M PROUD OF WHAT I'M DOING TO SUPPORT MY LITTLE FAMILY 
AS SOON AS I'VE GOT THE MONEY 
I THINK WELL THAT'S THIS MONTH'S RENT PAID 
I THINK BRILLIANT THAT CAN GO TOWARDS MIA'S CRECHE 
I THINK WHERE'S THE NEXT ONE 
WHO HAVE I GOT TO TALK TO NOW 
TONIGHT'S NOT BEEN BRILLIANT 
I COULD HAVE BEEN AT HOME DOING AN ESSAY OR REHEARSING FOR THIS PLAY THAT I'VE GOT SOON 
OR YOU KNOW IN MY WARM BED AND HAVING A NICE BATH 
ANYTHING ANYTHING BUT HERE 
IT'S TIMES LIKE THIS WHEN I SIT THERE AND I THINK 
THERE IS NO POINT I MIGHT AS WELL QUIT 
PEOPLE COME INTO THIS HOPING TO MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY 
AND I'M NOT STUPID AND I KNEW THAT I WAS NEVER GOING TO MAKE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS A NIGHT 
I WASN'T GOING TO PUSH MYSELF TO MAKE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS A NIGHT 
BUT YOU GOTTA MAKE IT WORTH YOUR WHILE A LITTLE BIT 
YOU'VE GOT TO AT LEAST PAY YOUR TAXI FARE 
AT THE MOMENT IT LOOKS LIKE I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO HAVE TAXI FARE HOME 
OH HELLO 
HELLO YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO MIA 
YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO MIA 
MIA DENISE 
O. K. SHE'S HERE HOLD ON IT'S FOR YOU 
AMY IS IN TOUCH WITH HER PARENTS 
BUT IS DETERMINED TO STAY FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT FROM THEM 
MY DAD DOESN'T ACTUALLY KNOW THAT I'M A DANCER 
WHY NOT I DIDN'T TELL HIM BECAUSE 
I DIDN'T SEE THE POINT ONE DIDN'T SEE THE NEED TO 
WERE YOU WORRIED ABOUT HIS REACTION 
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT HIS REACTION YES 
BUT ALSO YOU KNOW MY PARENTS DON'T HAVE ANY INFLUENCE OVER WHAT I DO IN MY LIFE ANY MORE 
SO ACTUALLY IT WOULD ONLY JUST CAUSE UPSET 
WHERE THERE DOESN'T NEED TO BE 
IF I DON'T CHOOSE TO TELL THEM SOMETHING ABOUT MY LIFE 
THEN THAT'S THAT BECAUSE THEY DON'T INFLUENCE MY DECISIONS ANY MORE 
AY AY 
I MEAN IF HE WAS INTERESTED AND IF HE ASKED ME 
I WOULDN'T LIE TO HIM 
AND IF HE STARTED TO HAVE A GO AT ME 
AND YOU KNOW SHOW THAT HE WAS DISPLEASED BY IT 
I WOULD JUST SIMPLY TURN AROUND AND SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT 
I'VE LIVED ON MY OWN SINCE I WAS SIXTEEN 
I'M AN ADULT NOW YOU KNOW 
I'M VERY CAPABLE OF MAKING MY OWN MISTAKES MY OWN DECISIONS 
AND I'VE GOT A CHILD OF MY OWN 
AND THEY DON'T PARTICULARLY OFFER THEIR HELP EITHER FINANCIALLY 
SO SO I DON'T SEE 
THAT'S NOT GOOD IS IT DON'T THROW THINGS 
ER I THINK IF I DID RECEIVE MONEY OFF THEM 
MAYBE IT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL MORE OBLIGED TO LET THEM IN ON MY CAREER DECISIONS AND STUFF 
SO I'M KIND OF GLAD THAT I DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT 
PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE I DON'T ASK FOR HELP 
PERHAPS THAT'S THE REASON WHY HE DOESN'T HELP ME FINANCIALLY 
BECAUSE I DON'T ASK HIM TO WHY DON'T YOU ASK 
PRIDE I WON'T ASK BECAUSE OF PRIDE REALLY 
AMY WANTS TO MEET OTHER STUDENTS WHO ARE WORKING IN THE SEX INDUSTRY 
SOME EARN SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN HER 
BUT THE RISKS THEY TAKE ARE HIGHER 
WE'VE ARRANGED FOR AMY TO MEET A BUSINESS STUDIES STUDENT 
WHO EARNS NINE HUNDRED A NIGHT WORKING AS AN ESCORT 
HER FRIENDS AND FAMILY DON'T KNOW SHE FUNDS HER STUDIES THIS WAY 
SO SHE WANTS TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A REALLY TOUGH DECISION 
TO MAKE WHEN YOU DECIDED TO DO IT 
IT WAS BUT THEN I REALISED MY DEBTS WERE GETTING HIGHER AND HIGHER 
AND HIGHER AND HIGHER AND I WAS LIKE THERE'S NO JOBS 
SO I DECIDED TO DO WHAT WAS BEST 
I NEEDED MONEY AND I NEEDED IT QUICK 
WHEN DID YOU START DOING WHAT YOU DO FOR MONEY 
I ONLY STARTED AT THE END OF LAST YEAR 
I REPLIED TO AN ADVERT ON A WEBSITE 
IT WAS A MAN IN HIS FIFTIES LOOKING FOR SOME COMPANY 
WE HAD SOME DRINKS WENT TO HIS ROOM HAD SEXUAL INTERCOURSE 
WAS IT A NICE EXPERIENCE ALTOGETHER 
YES HE WAS NICE BUT I WAS REALLY DESPERATE AT THE TIME 
IF IT'S GOING TO HELP PAY MY SHARE OF THE BILLS PUT FOOD IN MY MOUTH 
CLOTHES ON MY BACK AND HELP SHIFT SOME DEBTS THEN I'M PREPARED TO DO IT 
DOES IT NOT AFFECT YOUR STUDIES OR ANYTHING 
NO I'M A FIRST YEAR SO MY WORK LOAD'S NOT THAT HIGH 
BUT AS SOON AS I GO INTO SUBSEQUENT YEARS 
THE WORKLOAD'S GOING TO GET HIGHER AND HIGHER 
AND I CAN JUST PICK AND CHOOSE WHAT DAYS AND I DO AND DON'T WORK 
COULD YOU AFFORD TO STUDY IF YOU WEREN'T DOING THE ESCORTING 
NO I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE HAD TO DROP OUT 
DO YOU EVER WORRY ABOUT SAFETY ISSUES 
I ALWAYS INSIST THAT I MEET THEM IN A PUBLIC PLACE 
I TRY NOT TO GET DRUNK IN FRONT OF A CLIENT 
DO YOU MAKE ANYBODY PHONE YOU OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
BECAUSE NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW IT'S A BIT DIFFICULT TO DO THAT 
I CAN'T RING ANYBODY CAN'T TELL ANYONE WHERE I'M GOING 
THAT'S SCARY THAT WOULD SCARE THE LIFE OUT OF ME 
THAT'S WHY I'D HAVE TO TELL SOMEBODY 
ME PERSONALLY I CAN'T KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT ANYWAY 
IF I DID TELL SOMEBODY I'D PRETTY MUCH HAVE TO LIE 
AND I COULDN'T DO THAT REALLY SO I JUST HAD TO KEEP IT TO MYSELF 
SO IS IT REALLY WORTHWHILE BEING AN ESCORT THEN 
IF IT'S HELPING ME TO SUPPORT MYSELF FINANCIALLY THEN YES 
IT'S REALLY DEPRESSED ME THAT'S SHE'S DOING IT 
COS SHE SEEMS LIKE SHE'S GOT HER HEAD SCREWED ON 
A NICE YOUNG GIRL 
SO 
I JUST DON'T WANT TO OPEN THE NEWSPAPER NEXT WEEK 
AND SEE A PICTURE OF HER MUTILATED DECAPITATED 
RAPED 
AMY'S FIRST YEAR AS A SINGLE MUM AND STUDENT WAS A STRUGGLE 
AS THE SECOND YEAR BEGAN HER DEBTS CONTINUED TO RISE 
AND SHE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE ENDS MEET LIVING ON HER OWN 
AS A RESULT AMY TURNED TO SOMEONE FOR SUPPORT 
BUT SHE HASN'T BEEN UPFRONT ABOUT HER LIVING ARRANGEMENTS WITH US 
OR HER COLLEGE IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY 
SHE MOVED IN WITH HER TUTOR PETE SEVEN MONTHS AGO 
AMY HAS ADMITTED TO SLEEPING WITH PETE BUT SHE SAYS HE'S NOT HER BOYFRIEND 
THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL ME AND PETE COULD EVER HAVE A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP LIKE THAT 
HE'S AN OLD MAN 
IT MADE SENSE MOVING IN TOGETHER BECAUSE PETE'S RENT WAS RIDICULOUSLY HIGH 
I NEEDED A MALE AROUND BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE BREAKING INTO THE HOUSE AND STUFF 
I WAS QUITE SCARED 
BUT DOES LIVING WITH HER TUTOR MEAN SHE GETS PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT AT COLLEGE 
HE DOESN'T HELP ME WITH MY WORK ANY MORE THAN ANY OTHER STUDENT 
WE DON'T REALLY DISCUSS THINGS LIKE THAT AT HOME 
SO IT'S NOT A PROBLEM 
HERE WE GO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT 
SMELLS NICE 
HERE WE ARE YORKSHIRE PUDDINGS 
PETE'S BEEN FANTASTIC BECAUSE WHEN I GO AND WORK IN THE CLUB 
HE'S SACRIFICED A LOT OF WEEKENDS AND STUFF 
SO THAT I CAN GO TO WORK AT NIGHT AND HE'S HERE TO LOOK AFTER MIA 
AND I KNOW SHE'S IN SAFE HANDS IT'S NOT JUST A BABYSITTER OR ANYTHING 
ALSO IT WAS LIKE FINDING THE TIME TO DO ESSAYS AND STUFF 
IT'S PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO WRITTEN WORK WITH MIA AROUND 
SO I KNEW I'D HAVE PROBLEMS UNLESS SOMEBODY WAS GOING TO BE THERE 
TO HELP ME OUT AND TAKE HER OFF MY HANDS FOR A FEW HOURS AT LEAST 
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE STARTED TO GET A LITTLE BIT FUNNY AROUND US 
WHEN THEY REALISED THAT YOU WERE LAP DANCING 
LIKE I'VE PUSHED YOU INTO IT OR ENCOURAGED YOU INTO IT 
ONLY TO WOMEN MEN THINK THAT YOU'RE BRILLIANT 
DO THEY MEN THINK YOU'RE LIKE HUGH HEFNER 
EVERYONE'S TRYING TO DESTROY THEIR MARRIAGE SO THEY CAN GO OUT AND GET A LAP DANCER TO LIVE WITH THEM 
A NINETEEN YEAR OLD LAP DANCER 
IT WAS QUITE THE OPPOSITE REALLY 
I JUST WENT OFF ONE DAY AND DID IT 
CAME BACK AND I WAS LIKE YEAH I'M A LAP DANCER 
SO THE NEXT NIGHT WHAT WE DECIDED TO DO TO GO DOWN TO LEGS ELEVEN 
WHEN I WAS WORKING 
WELL WE STARTED ON ONE DIDN'T WE 
WENT INTO THE CLUB AND I HAD THREE DANCES IN THE END DIDN'T I 
YOU WERE LIKE A KID IN A SWEET SHOP 
I WANT THAT ONE I WANT THAT ONE I WANT THAT ONE 
YEAH I QUITE ENJOYED MYSELF 
BUT I NEEDED TO GET A BREADTH OF EXPERIENCE DIDN'T I REALLY 
AND THEN I WENT THROUGH AND WELL THE FIRST ONE DID THIS 
AND THAT WAS QUITE GOOD 
THE SECOND ONE SHOVED A NIPPLE UP MY NOSE AND THAT WAS BAD 
THERE WAS DIFFERENT THINGS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THAT THEY DID OR DIDN'T DO 
AND WE KINDA TALKED ABOUT IT ALL NIGHT AND IN THE END 
YOU GOT A PICTURE AN IMAGE IN YOUR HEAD OF WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO DO 
AT LEAST IT GAVE YOU THE CONFIDENCE TO GO IN AND START 
I'VE ALWAYS SAID IF YOU EVER NEED THAT HELP IN THE FUTURE 
I'LL BE REALLY HAPPY 
YOU COULDN'T COME BACK IN THE CLUB BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD MIA ALL THE TIME 
I KNOW 
OKEY DOKEY 
I DON'T THINK IT'S WEIRD THAT PETE CAME TO THE LAP DANCING CLUB 
HE DIDN'T HAVE A DANCE OFF ME 
HE HAD DANCES OFF ALL THE OTHER GIRLS I THOUGHT IT WAS QUITE FUN 
AND ALSO IT WAS NICE TO SEE HIM THERE SUPPORTING ME 
BECAUSE THE FIRST TIME YOU GO TO A PLACE LIKE THAT 
IT'S A VERY NERVE WRACKING THING 
I WAS SO NERVOUS AND IT WAS NICE TO SEE A FRIENDLY FACE 
PETE SAYS HE DIDN'T TAKE THE DECISION TO MOVE IN WITH AMY LIGHTLY 
I WANTED TO MOVE BACK TO SOLIHULL 
AND I THINK AMY NEEDED SOME DISTANCE FROM WHAT HAD GONE ON IN THE PAST 
AND SO TOGETHER WE WERE ABLE TO PUT OUR FUNDS TOGETHER 
AND GET SOMEWHERE THAT WAS NICER THAN WE COULD ON OUR OWN 
BUT PETE HASN'T TOLD THE COLLEGE HE'S LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE 
AS ONE OF HIS STUDENTS AND HE KNOWS HE'S A TAKING A RISK 
OBVIOUSLY THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN IS THAT I LOSE MY JOB 
THAT PEOPLE IN HIGH PLACES SEE THIS AS INAPPROPRIATE 
JUMP TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE WAS 
AN INAPPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US 
AND TAKE IT FROM THERE 
HOWEVER I THINK SOMETIMES IN LIFE YOU NEED CERTAIN PEOPLE 
AND YOU'VE GOT A CONNECTION BEYOND THE YEARS 
AMY AND I ARE KIND OF CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH 
AMY'S STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY LAP DANCING 
AND THE LONG HOURS ARE AFFECTING HER COLLEGE WORK 
SHE'S KEEN TO HEAR HOW OTHER GIRLS IN THE SEX INDUSTRY PROFIT 
AND IS HERE TO MEET LAP DANCER TURNED SOFT PORN ACTRESS CAROLINE 
TELL ME HOW IT ALL STARTED 
LIKE YOU I STARTED LAP DANCING AFTER I LEFT UNI 
AND THEN THE CLUB ENDED UP CLOSING 
THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING IN NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO BE MADE 
WHAT KIND OF STUFF DO YOU DO 
IT VARIES 
LIKE YESTERDAY I WAS DOING STILLS PHOTOGRAPHS 
AND THEN WE DID A VIDEO AFTERWARDS TO COMPLEMENT IT 
THAT WAS BOY GIRL THE DAY BEFORE I WAS JUST DOING PHOTOS 
IT'S NICE COS YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GONNA BE 
WHAT'S THE MOST THAT YOU'VE MADE IN A WEEK 
GOD I DON'T KNOW 
HAVE YOU NOT HAD ONE WEEK WHERE IT'S JUST BEEN LIKE WOW 
COUPLE OF GRAND MAYBE NOTHING GROUND SHATTERING 
IF I MADE THAT IN A WEEK I'D PROBABLY HAVE THE NEXT TWO WEEKS OFF 
I'VE NEVER HAD THAT NEVER 
I MAKE NOW THE SAME AS I MADE AS A FULL TIME ESTATE AGENT 
BUT I CAN WORK 
THIS MONTH I THINK I'VE WORKED SIX DAYS SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
ARE YOU TEMPTED 
I WOULD BE LYING IF I SAID NO 
BECAUSE OF MORE MONEY 
A FEW WEEKS LATER AMY'S TAKING CAROLINE UP ON HER OFFER 
SHE'S ON HER WAY TO A WAREHOUSE NEAR HULL TO SEE IF PORN COULD BE A WAY TO MAKE CASH QUICK 
I'M FEELING KINDA EXCITED ACTUALLY IF THAT SOUNDS DAFT 
BECAUSE I'M BEING LET INTO A WORLD THAT I HAVEN'T A CLUE 
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT AND I DON'T WANT TO MAKE PRESUMPTIONS 
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO ABOUT ME SO I'M NOT GONNA JUDGE OR MAKE PRESUMPTIONS 
I'M JUST GONNA GO AND SEE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT 
CAROLINE CAN EARN THOUSANDS OF POUNDS A WEEK WORKING IN THE PORN INDUSTRY 
I AM HOPING FOR AMY TO SEE THAT THIS IS JUST A LEGITIMATE JOB 
SOMETHING THAT SHE COULD DO SHE COULDN'T DO DEPENDING ON WHETHER SHE ENJOYED IT 
TAKING THE FEAR OUT OF IT A LITTLE BIT 
FIRST UP A PHOTO SHOOT 
TURN YOUR HEAD UP SLIGHTLY THAT'S IT 
IN THEORY THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DIFFERENCE IN WHAT I'M DOING AND WHAT AMY'S DOING 
WE'RE BOTH DEPENDING ON WHICH ANGLE YOU LOOK AT 
EITHER EXPLOITING MEN OR BEING EXPLOITED IN ORDER TO GAIN MONEY 
WE'RE USING OUR NATURAL TALENTS AT THE END OF THE DAY 
IT'S WHY THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN 
WE ARE BOTH FULLY AWARE OF THE EFFECT THAT THE CURVES WE HAVE 
CAN HAVE ON GENTLEMEN AND WHEREAS SOME WOMEN USE IT TO GET AN EXTRA SPACE IN A PARKING SLOT 
OR TO WORK THEIR WAY UP IN AN OFFICE 
WE'RE USING IT ON A REALLY SIMPLE BASIS TO GET HARD EARNED CASH 
O. K. STAY LIKE THAT A SEC 
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU ACTUALLY ENJOY DOING 
ABOUT THIS WHEN YOU'RE TAKING PICTURES 
IF IT'S GOING REALLY WELL YOU CAN FEEL IT'S GOING REALLY WELL 
IT'S LIKE A BIG EGO RUSH 
BEAUTIFUL THAT'S GORGEOUS 
EXCELLENT BEAUTIFUL 
THAT'S IT GORGEOUS 
STAY LIKE THAT 
OH SHIT THAT'S COLD 
WHAT'S GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU'RE DOING THESE POSES 
AND HAVING THE PICTURES DONE 
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE ON AUTO PILOT MECHANIC IT'S 
AM I BLOCKING MY BOOB IS MY BUM ROUND ENOUGH 
IT'S MOSTLY 
GOD THAT HURTS IS QUITE A GOOD ONE 
BEAUTIFUL THAT'S GOOD 
JUST PUSH YOUR SHOULDER BACK A BIT MORE 
THAT'S ABOUT IT I THINK 
THANKS A LOT I'LL KEEP THESE ON SO I DON'T GET COLD 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WATCHING CAROLINE SPREAD HER LEGS LIKE CHICKEN LEGS IT'S LIKE 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WHETHER YOU WANT TO GIGGLE OR GO HMM 
TRY AND LOOK SERIOUS AND PROFESSIONAL YES I CAN SEE WHY THAT'S A GOOD POSE 
O. K. GUYS READY WHEN YOU ARE 
CAROLINE'S NOT JUST AN ON SCREEN STAR 
SHE ALSO DIRECTS PORN FILMS SO THAT WHEN SHE STOPS WORKING IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA 
SHE CAN STILL EARN A LIVING FROM SEX 
UNLESS YOU HAVE FANTASTIC SURGERY YOU CAN'T MODEL FOREVER 
THIS IS A REALLY NICE WAY OF GOING ON TO THE NEXT STEP FOR ME 
I'M HOPING SHE'LL SEE THE WHOLE CAREER PATH RATHER THAN 
WHAT SOME PEOPLE SEE AS A QUICK EASY WAY TO MAKE SOME MONEY 
LOSE THE BRA 
BUT AMY'S SEEING A LOT MORE THAN A CAREER PATH 
I WAS JUST WATCHING THESE PEOPLE RANDOMLY HAVE SEX ON STAGE 
WHICH WAS A REAL EYE OPENER 
AND CONSIDERING HOW UNCOMFORTABLE I WAS JUST WATCHING 
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO EVER DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THERE'S JUST CERTAIN LINES I DON'T THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO CROSS 
KNOWING HOW MUCH IT WOULD AFFECT MY FUTURE MY CAREER 
EVERYTHING I'VE WORKED TOWARDS 
NOBODY WOULD TAKE ME AS A SERIOUS ACTRESS 
AND I THINK IT WOULD AFFECT MIA'S FUTURE 
AND THE WAY SHE THOUGHT OF ME 
BACK IN BURTON AMY'S GOT JUST TWO WEEKS 
UNTIL SHE TAKES THE STAGE WITH FELLOW STUDENTS BEN AND KAYLEIGH 
SHE'S ARRANGED A READ THROUGH OF THE PLAY THEY WILL BE STAGING 
AND HAS GOT THE LEAD ROLE OF A YOUNG TEACHER 
HER PERFORMANCE IS TO BE ASSESSED AND SHE NEEDS TO DO WELL 
SHE GOT HER FLAT BROKEN INTO SHE LOST A STEREO 
THEY EVEN TOOK HER CAT 
I REALLY LIKE THE PERFORMANCE SIDE BUT I'M FINDING IT HARD 
TO GET THE TIME TO DO THE THEORY AND LEARN MY LINES REALLY 
I WOULD SAY IT'S DEFINITELY BECAUSE I'VE GOT SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS ON 
AT THE MOMENT WITH WORK WITH COLLEGE WITH MIA 
I FIND IT EVEN HARDER TO SLOT COLLEGE WORK IN 
BECAUSE BY THE TIME SHE'S GONE INTO BED 
AND I'VE ATTEMPTED TO CLEAN UP THE DISASTER SHE'S LEFT BEHIND HER 
I'M TIRED 
I DON'T WANT TO SIT DOWN AND START DOING A TWO THOUSAND WORD ESSAY 
IF I DON'T GET THROUGH AND GET A GOOD MARK FOR THIS PERFORMANCE 
THEN POSSIBLY I COULD FAIL 
THEN EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE JUST BEEN A WASTE OF TIME REALLY 
BECAUSE THERE'D HAVE BEEN NO POINT IN GETTING THE JOB IN THE FIRST PLACE 
BECAUSE THEN I'VE NOT COME OUT WITH MY DEGREE AT THE END OF IT 
THEN IT'S ALL DONE FOR NOTHING REALLY 
START ALL OVER AGAIN 
AMY'S NOW BEEN WORKING AS A LAP DANCER FOR OVER SIX MONTHS 
BUT SHE'S BARELY MAKING ENOUGH CASH TO GET BY 
LET ALONE PAY OFF ANY DEBTS 
THE LONG HOURS AND LATE NIGHTS MEAN SHE FEELS 
BOTH HER DAUGHTER AND HER COLLEGE WORK ARE BEING NEGLECTED 
THESE COMBINED PRESSURES HAVE FINALLY PUSHED AMY INTO MAKING A DECISION 
CAN YOU SAY QUACK 
I'VE DECIDED OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS 
I'VE NOT BEEN EARNING ENOUGH MONEY AT THE CLUB 
AND I THINK IT'S TIME TO GIVE IT UP REALLY 
IT'S TAKING UP TOO MUCH TIME OF MY COLLEGE WORK 
I'M TIRED IN LESSONS ALL THE TIME 
I'M NOT DOING MY THEORY WORK LIKE I SHOULD BE 
AND I CAN'T LOOK AFTER MIA PROPERLY 
SO SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE 
AND IT'S DANCING 
GOT TO MAKE A DECISION WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT GET MY PRIORITIES STRAIGHT 
WHETHER I WANT A DECENT DEGREE OR NOT 
I THINK IT'S TIME TO SORT OF PUSH ACTING A LITTLE BIT MORE 
LOOK TO DO SOME MODELLING JOBS MAYBE TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA MONEY 
I'VE JUST GOT TO PUSH ON WITH THAT REALLY 
BACK AT HOME AND WITH NO TIME TO WASTE 
AMY'S BUSY SENDING HER C. V. AND PHOTOS TO ACTING AGENTS MODELLING SCOUTS AND PROMO COMPANIES 
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE NEED TO MAKE CASH NOW 
IT'S ABOUT FOLLOWING HER CHILDHOOD DREAMS 
EVER SINCE I REMEMBER I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO ACT ON STAGE 
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO PERFORM TO SOME DEGREE 
SO I THINK MODELLING IS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT AS WELL 
IT'S PERFORMANCE IN FRONT OF A CAMERA 
SO I'VE ALWAYS I'VE NOT WANTED TO DO ANYTHING ELSE 
MY AMBITIONS ARE VERY HIGH 
AND MY GOALS ARE PROBABLY A LOT HIGHER THAN MOST PEOPLE'S 
BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP ME FROM THINKING IT COULD BE POSSIBLE 
FOR WANTING TO ACHIEVE MY DREAMS 
I KNOW THAT IT'S JUST GOING TO BE DOWN TO HARD WORK 
I'M PREPARED TO DO THAT FOR AS LONG AS I CAN AFFORD TO 
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY 
AMY'S ALREADY RECEIVED ONE REJECTION LETTER FROM A COMPANY 
SHE RECENTLY AUDITIONED FOR 
UNFORTUNATELY AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION 
YOU WERE UNSUCCESSFUL ON THIS OCCASION 
WE WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK IN THE FUTURE PRESENTING CAREER 
AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TROUBLE TO TAKE PART IN THE AUDITION YOURS SINCERELY 
WELL WHAT CAN YOU DO 
I'M A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED BUT I KNOW THAT ERM 
JUST GOTTA CARRY ON GOING YOU KNOW 
THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE IT ARE GENERALLY PEOPLE THAT ARE SO FOCUSED 
AND SO DRIVEN WITH DETERMINATION AND AMBITION AND 
THEY JUST CARRY ON THEY CARRY ON PESTERING PEOPLE 
AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO 
AMY'S LUCK IS CHANGING 
SHE'S IN LIVERPOOL 
TO AUDITION FOR A MODELLING JOB AT AN UPCOMING FASHION SHOW 
THE ORGANISERS WANT TO SEE IF SHE'S CUT OUT FOR THE CATWALK 
IT COULD BE THE MOMENT SHE'S BEEN WAITING FOR 
THIS JOB IF I GOT IT 
WOULD MEAN QUITE A BIT OF WELL EXPOSURE I THINK 
YOU KNOW PERHAPS MEETING THE RIGHT PEOPLE 
BEING IN THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT THE RIGHT ATMOSPHERE 
ERM TO MEET HOPEFULLY AGENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
THAT COULD POTENTIALLY WANT TO PUT ME ON THEIR BOOKS 
I'M QUITE NERVOUS ABOUT TONIGHT 
BECAUSE I'M HAVING A BIT OF A BAD HAIR DAY AND A BAD FACE DAY 
YOU ALWAYS GET NERVOUS COS YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT THAT FEELING INSIDE YOU 
THINKING THIS COULD BE IT THIS COULD BE ONE STEP AWAY 
FROM GETTING WHERE I WANT TO BE 
FIRST AMY'S GOT TO FACE THE PANEL OF JUDGES 
WHO ARE ORGANISING THE WEEK LONG EVENT 
BEFORE THEY DECIDE IF AMY'S THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THE JOB 
SHE NEEDS TO DEMONSTRATE HER CATWALK POTENTIAL 
HELLO JUST TELL US YOUR NAME AND WHERE YOU'RE FROM 
I'M AMY AND I'M FROM BIRMINGHAM WOULD YOU LIKE TO WALK FOR US 
IT'S JUST TO THE STAIRS AND BACK TO THE MARK 
WHY WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE PART OF LIVERPOOL FASHION WEEK I THINK IT'D BE A REALLY GOOD EXPERIENCE 
A REALLY GOOD WAY TO MEET PEOPLE 
AND GET SOME GOOD ADVICE ABOUT STARTING OUT AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
AND HAVE YOU DONE ANY MODELLING IN THE PAST 
I'VE DONE A LITTLE BIT 
HAVE YOU DONE ANY CATWALK I'VE NOT DONE CATWALK YET 
WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE PART OF YOUR BODY I LIKE MY BUM 
AT LEAST YOU'RE HONEST 
OH IT'S NOT BAD I HAD A LITTLE GIRL A YEAR AND A HALF AGO 
AND EVERYTHING'S GONE A LITTLE BIT SOUTH BUT IT'S NOT TOO BAD 
FAIR ENOUGH 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME 
SEE YOU AGAIN SOON BYE 
AMY'S DESPERATE TO GET THIS JOB 
AND FEELS OBLIGED TO TELL JUDGE DANIELLE 
THAT SHE'S BEEN WORKING AS A LAPDANCER 
WHAT DO YOU THINK DO YOU THINK IT'LL HINDER MY PROGRESS 
I THINK THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY LIKE YOU SAY 
EVERYBODY HAS TO MAKE A LIVING YOU'VE GOT A CHILD AS WELL 
I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK IT'S AN ISSUE 
AND IF AN AGENCY THINKS YOU'VE GOT A LOOK THAT YOU CAN WORK WITH 
IF THEY THINK THEY CAN GET YOU BOOKED AND MAKE MONEY FROM IT MOST IMPORTANTLY 
YOU KNOW IF YOU GET BOOKED 
THEN YOU EARN MONEY AND THEY GET PAID TOO 
SO IF THEY SEE SOMETHING IN YOU I DON'T SEE WHY IT SHOULD BE YOU KNOW 
ARE YOU WITH ANY MODELLING AGENCIES AT THE MOMENT NO 
I'VE SORT OF WAITED AND BEEN THINKING I NEED TO SPEAK TO SOMEBODY 
BEFORE I DO ANY MORE 
I THINK YOU DO HAVE A COMMERCIAL LOOK 
BUT I THINK FACIALLY YOU'VE GOT A KINDA FASHION EDITORIAL LOOK 
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KINDA SEE IN VOGUE 
IF YOU CAN GET PICTURES DONE 
I THINK YOU'D BE ON A GOOD ROAD THERE WHERE YOU'D BE ABLE TO 
MAKE A GOOD START I THINK YOU COULD DO GLAMOUR IF YOU WANTED TO 
BUT I WOULDN'T PUT YOU IN THE GLAMOUR 
I'M SICK OF THAT SORT OF END NOW AND I'M TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FROM IT 
I THINK WITH GLAMOUR IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH 
GO FOR IT BE YOURSELF BE SMILEY 
BE AS CONFIDENT AS YOU CAN BE AND YOU'LL GET THERE AND DO REALLY WELL 
THANK YOU BE YOURSELF THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
THIS WAS ONE OF AMY'S FIRST CASTINGS 
AND SHE WAS KEEN TO MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION 
AT FIRST WHEN AMY CAME ON 
SHE WAS A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS BUT ONCE SHE STOOD THERE FOR A WHILE 
SHE WARMED AND WAS KIND OF IN THE ATMOSPHERE THEN 
HER COMFIDENCE CAME OUT MORE AND SHE WAS A BIT CHEEKY AND I LIKED THAT 
THAT SCORED A FEW POINTS WITH MYSELF AND THE OTHER JUDGES 
THAT WAS VERY NERVE WRACKING 
I DIDN'T THINK THERE'D BE THAT MANY PEOPLE ON THE PANEL FOR A START 
AND I DIDN'T THINK WALKING WAS SO HARD 
AND IT WAS LIKE OBVIOUSLY I DIDN'T REALLY PRACTISE A WALK ANYWAY 
AND IT WAS JUST OH WELL NEVER MIND 
SHE'S A REALLY NICE GIRL I HOPE SHE HAS WHAT IT TAKES 
OR SHE CAN FIND SOMETHING FOR HER 
BUT MAYBE NOT THE MODELLING COS IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET INTO 
ACTING YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK A CERTAIN WAY 
SO MAYBE SHE SHOULD AIM DOWN THE ACTING 
OR IF SHE CAN SING 
YEAH SHE'S A NICE GIRL I GENUINELY HOPE SHE HAS WHAT IT TAKES 
I THINK I TRIED MY BEST 
SO HOPEFULLY THEY'LL REMEMBER ME 
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO 
I THINK IT'S A NUMBERS GAME 
IF YOU GO FOR AS MANY THINGS THEN SOMETHING'S DURELY GOT TO TAKE OFF 
AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU'VE GOT THE CONFIDENCE AND DETERMINATION THAT SHE HAS DEFINITELY 
I WOULD LIKE THE JOB 
THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IS THERE'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED GIRLS IN THERE 
A LOT TO CHOOSE FROM 
SO THE REALITY IS THAT I'M PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE ONE OF THOSE 
BUT I CAN STIL HOPE SO 
BACK IN BIRMINGHAM THERE'S BAD NEWS WAITING FOR AMY 
WHEN'S COUNCIL TAX DUE NOW 
SINCE SHE STOPPED WORKING AT THE LAP DANCING CLUB 
THE MONEY'S DRIED UP AND SHE OWES HOUSEMATE PETE HUNDREDS OF POUNDS 
YOU'RE GETTING STROPPY NOW NO 
HER DIRE FINANCIAL SITUATION MEANS ONLY ONE THING 
WHAT WE GOING TO DO 
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CARRY ON WORKING AT LEGS ELEVEN WORKING MORE DAYS 
LIKE FOUR OUT OF SEVEN 
ALL I KEEP THINKING IS I'VE GOT TO EARN SOME MONEY SOMEHOW 
I'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO WORK 
AND NOT ONLY GO BACK TO WORK BUT REALLY REALLY WORK 
I MEAN DO FIVE DAYS A WEEK BECAUSE I CAN'T SIT STILL 
KNOWING THAT I OWE SO MUCH MONEY TO PEOPLE 
UNTIL AMY GETS A MODELLING OR ACTING JOB 
SHE'S GOING BACK TO WORK AT THE LAP DANCING CLUB 
THIS IS NOT WHERE AMY WANTS TO BE 
BY AND LARGE I WOULD SAY I HATE MEN NOW I HAVE TO DO THIS JOB 
I THINK I'D PROBABLY BE A LESBIAN NOW IF I HAD THE CHOICE 
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN HOW SOME MEN CAN GO ON A POWER TRIP 
YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'VE GOT THIS MONEY IN THEIR HANDS 
OBVIOUSLY NOT EVERYBODY'S THE SAME BUT 
THEY THINK THEY CAN TREAT YOU LIKE DIRT JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE PAYING YOU 
WHEN REALLY THEY'RE THE SAD SODS THAT HAVE TO PAY FOR IT 
OBVIOUSLY 
YOU SOUND VERY ANGRY ABOUT THAT 
I'M ANGRY THAT PEOPLE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GO AND DO THIS 
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO LOOK AFTER MY DAUGHTER 
FIT MY STUDIES AROUND HER AND WORK AT THE SAME TIME 
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO ANY OF IT IF I HAD MORE MONEY 
OR IF THEY GAVE US FREE CHILD CARE EVEN 
AFTER A LONG NIGHT AT WORK AMY'S MADE HER WAY HOME 
NOT REALLY A GREAT NIGHT 
IT'S A BIT OF A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM REALLY 
YOU SORT OF THINK THAT YOU GO THERE YOU DRESS UP YOU LOOK YOUR BEST 
AND MEN COME UP TO YOU FOR DANCES 
I FIND IT REALLY DIFFICULT TO CONVINCE MEN 
TO SPEND FIFTEEN OF THEIR HARD EARNED CASH ON A DANCE WITH ME 
IT'S A NEW DAY BUT AMY'S GOT NEWS THAT WILL SET HER BACK 
HER AND PETE ARE GOING THEIR SEPARATE WAYS 
PETE LAST NIGHT SAT ME DOWN 
AND SAID THAT HE'S COME TO A DEFINITE DECISION 
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AT THE END OF THE MONTH 
HE'S DECIDED THAT HE THINKS IT'S BEST WE GO OUR OWN WAYS 
OUR BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP OUR 
WE'RE GONNA BE PARTED 
IT'S GOING TO BE OVER 
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO CARRY ON WITHOUT HIM 
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO EVEN GO TO AUDITIONS AND THINGS 
WITHOUT HIS HELP 
HOW DO YOU THINK MIA WILL REACT 
MIA I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO TELL HER 
I KNOW SHE'S A BABY BUT SHE'S GOING TO BE GUTTED 
SHE LOVES PETE SO MUCH 
SHE'S GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY GUTTED 
AND IT REALLY UPSETS ME THAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO TELL HER 
IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE FASHION SHOW AND AMY'S IN LIVERPOOL 
SHE'S GOT THE MODELLING JOB 
AND WILL BE GETTING SOME MUCH NEEDED WORK EXPERIENCE 
SOMEWHERE OTHER THAN THE LAP DANCING CLUB 
PETE'S AGREED TO LOOK AFTER MIA BUT OTHER THINGS AREN'T GOING TO PLAN 
AT THE MOMENT I'M RUNNING SLIGHTLY LATE LIKE AN HOUR LATE AS USUAL 
AND I LOST MY SHOES 
SOMEWHERE I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'VE GONE 
I THINK I LEFT THEM IN BURTON 
AND I'VE GOT A COLD 
TONIGHT I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT NETWORKING HAVING A BIT OF FUN 
MEETING SOME INTERESTING PEOPLE 
I'M NOT GONNA GET PAID NO 
BUT I'M HOPING THAT IT'LL MAKE SENSE IN THE END 
COS IT COULD LEAD ON TO BETTER THINGS YOU KNOW 
TONIGHT'S GUEST LIST INVOLVES A GLITTERING ARRAY OF CELEBRITIES FOOTBALLERS AND ACTORS 
AMY HAS TO TAKE A BACK SEAT 
SHE'S GETTING READY IN THE BASEMENT 
AS THE GUESTS AND OTHER MODELS ARRIVE 
AMY'S NERVES ARE GETTING THE BETTER OF HER 
IT SEEMS PRETTY BUSY AND THERE'S QUITE A FEW MODELS HERE I THINK 
QUITE A FEW CELEBRITIES 
AND IT'S VERY NOISY AND QUITE SCARY 
AND THERE'S LOADS OF PAPARAZZI OUTSIDE AS WELL 
THEY DIDN'T PHOTOGRAPH ME THOUGH 
I'M REALLY NERVOUS AND I DON'T REALLY WANT TO DO IT I'D RATHER JUST GET DRUNK INSTEAD 
I THINK I'M JUST A BIT LIKE A RABBIT IN THE HEADLIGHTS AT THE MOMENT 
BUT I THINK THIS IS GONNA BE A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE 
SO I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT 
I JUST WANT TO GET OUT THERE AND GO HELLO I'VE ARRIVED 
THE PARTY'S IN FULL SWING AND THE OTHER MODELS TAKE TO THE RUNWAY 
BUT AMY OPTS OUT SHE'S MORE INTERESTED 
IN GETTING TO KNOW THE V. I. P.'S ON TONIGHT'S GLITTERING GUEST LIST 
I DIDN'T DO THE CATWALK BECAUSE I WAS DOING SOMETHING FAR MORE IMPORTANT 
I WAS MINGLING MINGLING 
THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING BUILDING FRIENDSHIPS 
THIS IS PROBABLY THE FIRST CLUB I'VE BEEN IN 
IN MONTHS WHERE I'VE NOT HAD TO LAP DANCE SO YEAH SO 
IT'S NICE NOT TO BE WALKING AROUND HALF NAKED 
AND ERM IT'S QUITE WARM AS WELL 
TROUBLE IS AMY DIDN'T GET PAID FOR TONIGHT'S EVENT 
AND WILL HAVE TO MAKE UP THE SHORT FALL AT THE WEEKEND 
TO MAKE BACK THE MONEY I'VE LOST TONIGHT 
I'M GONNA GO TO WORK ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AND POSSIBLY MONDAY AS WELL 
BACK AT THE CLUB DOING STRIPPING YOU KNOW 
BACK HOME LIFE RETURNS TO NORMAL 
MIA'S TAKING A LUNCHTIME NAP AND AMY'S TACKLING HER COLLEGE WORK 
AFTER THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF LIVERPOOL SHE'S GOT SOME GOOD NEWS 
I'M VERY PROUD OF MYSELF AT THE MINUTE 
I'VE JUST HAD MY MARKS BACK FOR LAST TERM AND FOR MY PERFORMANCE 
I'VE GOT A FIRST WHICH I'M REALLY PLEASED ABOUT 
IT MAKES EVERYTHING WORTHWHILE 
WITH WORKING LONG HOURS AT THE CLUB 
ALL THE TIME I SPEND WITH MIA BUT I'VE STILL MANAGED TO ACHIEVE A REASONABLE MARK 
OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS 
AMY'S BECOME AWARE THERE'S A GROWING NUMBER OF STUDENTS 
MAKING DIFFICULT CHOICES WHEN IT COMES TO PAYING FOR THEIR EDUCATION 
A LOT OF STUDENTS ARE GOING INTO COLLEGE WITH BLINKERS ON 
AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'LL GET THE MONEY FROM OR ANYTHING 
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THEIR FINANCES 
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES NEED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF A POLICY 
IF A STUDENT'S WORKING ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT 
AND THEN GOING INTO COLLEGE AND THEN TRYING TO BE AWAKE AND STUFF 
I THINK THEY NEED TO EMPATHISE REALLY WITH THEIR SITUATIONS 
STUDENTS SHOULDN'T BE STIGMATISED FOR DOING WHAT THEY CAN DO TO GET THEMSELVES A GOOD EDUCATION 
THERE'S A REASON WHY THEY'RE GOING INTO THE SEX INDUSTRY 
AND IF EDUCATION WAS A LITTLE BIT CHEAPER OR THERE WASN'T FEES AT ALL THEN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO IT 
AMY'S ALSO NOW AWARE THAT THERE ARE SOME MEANS TESTED GRANTS THAT SHE IS ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR 
BUT UNTIL THESE OR MORE MODELLING OR ACTING JOBS COME THROUGH 
AMY'S BACK WHERE SHE STARTED 
AND IS RETURNING TO WORK AS A LAP DANCER 
EVERY TIME I GO BACK TO THE CLUB 
I ALWAYS FEEL A LITTLE BIT LIKE A FAILURE 
YOU KNOW MY ACTING'S NOT COME THROUGH YET OR THE MODELLING 
IT'S VERY EASY TO FEEL TRAPPED BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY 
WHATEVER HAPPENS I'VE GOT TO PAY THE BILLS 
SO I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE CLUB FOR THE TIME BEING 
AND I HAVE TO MAKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY 
MONEY THAT I CAN'T MAKE ELSEWHERE 
WHICHEVER WAY YOU LOOK AT IT I'M FUNDING MY EDUCATION 
AND PEOPLE TAKE ME MORE SERIOUSLY BECAUSE OF THE DEGREE 
EVERY TIME IT GETS TOUGH I LOOK AT MIA SHE GIVES ME A SMILE 
AND I THINK I CAN'T LET YOU DOWN 
COS THEN THAT WOULD BE PROVING EVERYBODY RIGHT YOU KNOW 
EVERYBODY THAT TOLD ME HAVING MIA WAS THE WORST THING THAT COULD'VE HAPPENED TO ME 
OR THAT I'M A STUPID GIRL I'D BE PROVING THEM RIGHT IF I GAVE UP 
SO THAT'S WHY I'M NOT GOING TO 
I'M GOING TO FINISH I'M GOING TO GET MY DEGREE 
AND I'M GOING TO LIVE IN MY MANSION
