TONIGHT WE TRY TO GROW OUR OWN PETROL 
WHAT 
I DRIVE THE NEW LAMBORGHINI 
QUITE BADLY 
AND THE COOL WALL MUSE KRISTIN SCOTT THOMAS 
IS IN OUR REASONABLY PRICED CAR 
HELLO HELLO AND WELCOME 
THANK YOU 
THANK YOU NOW 
NOW BACK IN THE SUMMER WE WERE LITERALLY INUNDATED 
WITH A LETTER FROM A RAILWAY COMPANY WHO ASKED US TO DO A FEATURE ON THE SHOW 
ABOUT THE DANGERS OF LEVEL CROSSINGS 
EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T MAKE HEALTH AND SAFETY PUBLIC INFORMATION FILMS I THOUGHT I COULD PULL IT OFF 
UNTIL HE BARGED INTO THE OFFICE AND ANNOUNCED THAT HE WANTED TO DO IT YES 
I PRACTISED MY SERIOUS VOICE AND THIS IS WHAT I CAME UP WITH 
IT'S A COMMONLY HELD BELIEF THAT YOUNGER DRIVERS ARE THE ONES WHO CAUSE ALL BRITAIN'S ROAD ACCIDENTS 
TEARING ABOUT ON DRUGS WITH THEIR HATS ON BACK TO FRONT 
BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT ELDERLY PEOPLE ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A CRASH 
THAN THEIR GRANDCHILDREN 
THINK ABOUT IT WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HEARD OF A YOUNG PERSON 
DRIVING THE WRONG WAY DOWN A MOTORWAY 
NEVER IT'S ALWAYS AN OLD PERSON IN THEIR EIGHTIES 
AND HOW OFTEN DO YOU HEAR ABOUT A TEENAGER 
PLOUGHING THEIR CAR INTO THE SEA 
AGAIN NEVER IT'S ALWAYS AN OLD LADY IN A FIESTA 
BUT NOW IT SEEMS BRITAIN'S OLD PEOPLE HAVE FOUND A NEW WAY 
TO GET THEIR KICKS 
TERRIFYINGLY THEY'RE JUMPING THE LIGHTS AT LEVEL CROSSINGS 
LOOK AT THIS IDIOT 
CAUGHT ON C. C. T. V. LARKING ABOUT IN HIS RELIANT ROBIN 
HE WAS LUCKY NOT TO KILL SOMEONE 
IF WE EXAMINE THE FOOTAGE MORE CAREFULLY 
WE SEE THE REALLY WORRYING THING 
HE WASN'T EVEN WEARING A HIGH VISIBILITY JACKET 
THE TROUBLE IS THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN THEIR GRANDPARENTS DRIVING THROUGH THE RED LIGHTS 
WITH NO SAFETY CLOTHING AT ALL CAN THINK IT'S O. K. FOR THEM TO DO IT AS WELL 
THE FIGURES MAKE FOR APPALLING READING 
THERE ARE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED LEVEL CROSSINGS IN BRITAIN AND ACCORDING TO BRITISH RAIL OR WHATEVER THEY'RE CALLED NOW 
MANY PEOPLE ARE INJURED ON THEM EVERY YEAR 
YOU MIGHT THINK IT'S FUN TO JUMP THE RED LIGHTS 
YOU MIGHT THINK IT WILL SAVE YOU A FEW MINUTES 
YOU MIGHT THINK IT'S O. K. BECAUSE YOUR GRANDAD'S ALWAYS DOING IT 
OR BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A RENAULT ESPACE WHICH HAS A FIVE STAR EURO NCAP SAFETY RATING 
BUT IT'S NOT ALL RIGHT AS I SHALL NOW PROVE 
WITH A GRATUITOUS SHOT OF A TRAIN SMASHING INTO THE ESPACE 
AT VERY HIGH SPEED 
THAT'S QUICK 
IF YOU DROVE LIKE THAT ON THE PUBLIC ROAD YOU'D BE CALLED A MANIAC 
THAT'S TOAST 
THAT'S BAD 
I'D QUITE LIKE TO SEE THAT AGAIN 
IN SLOW MOTION 
AND EVEN SLOWER 
SO THAT IS HOW FAR THE TRAIN WENT FROM WHAT SEVENTY EIGHTY MILES AN HOUR 
THE MESSAGE THEN IS CLEAR 
UNLESS YOU WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO YOU 
ALWAYS W. WEAR THIS 
THANK YOU 
YOU IDIOT WHAT 
WELL JUST 
WHAT WHAT IN THE NAME OF GOD WAS THAT 
ALL THEY WANTED YOU TO DO WAS SAY DON'T RUN THE RED LIGHTS AT LEVEL CROSSINGS 
YES THAT 
AND WHAT SORT OF IMBECILE WATCHES A TRAIN CRASH INTO A CAR 
AND THEN JUMPS UP AND DOWN SHOUTING THAT'S TOAST 
I LIKE MAKING PUBLIC INFORMATION FILMS I'M GOING TO DO ONE ON SPEEDING 
I AM HONESTLY I'M GONNA SET YOU AND MAY ON FIRE 
MAY GETS ON THE MOTORCYCLE GOES REALLY FAST YOU STAND STILL 
JUST NO THIS IS A BAD IDEA 
AND THEN I'VE GOT A SKYSCRAPER ANYWAY I'LL FLESH IT OUT LATER COS NOW WE'RE GONNA DO THE NEWS 
WE BEGIN WITH THE MASERATI COUPE A CAR WE'VE NEVER BEEN ENTIRELY SURE ABOUT 
MAINLY BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK IT'S THAT GOOD LOOKING 
HOWEVER THERE IS A NEW ONE IT'S CALLED THE MASERATI GRAN TURISMO I HAVE A PICTURE OF IT AND IT'S 
A THING OF BEAUTY YEAH M. M. M. 
GORGEOUS YOU CAN TELL KRISTIN SCOTT THOMAS IS COMING AS A GUEST HOW 
HE'S WEARING A SUIT LOOK AT HIM 
IT'S ALL MY JEANS ARE IN THE WASH 
OH REALLY ALL OF A SUDDEN NINETY TWO PROGRAMMES WE'VE DONE YOU'VE BEEN IN JEANS 
NOW TODAY WHEN KRISTIN'S COMING IN THEY'RE ALL MUCKY 
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING FOR A JOB INTERVIEW 
THAT'S EXACTLY HOW HE LOOKS 
THIS MASERATI HE'S HAD HIS HAIR CUT AS WELL HE HAS 
I HAVE HAD MY HAIR CUT BECAUSE IT WAS TOO LONG 
LAST WEEK WERE YOU COMBING IT FRANTICALLY BEFORE YOU SHUT UP WHAT DID YOU SAY 
LAST WEEK I HAD MINE CUT AND YOU SAID HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT ON THE STUDIO DAY WAS GAY 
I SAID YOU SHOULD SPEND MORE THAN FOUR ON A HAIRCUT JAMES 
THAT'S WHAT I ACTUALLY SAID SO WHY DIDN'T YOU SHUT UP 
ANYWAY THE MASERATI THIS MASERATI 
WHAT'S IT GOT UNDER THE BONNET IT'S A FORTY TWO V. EIGHT 
SAME AS THE OLD ONE YEP FOUR HUNDRED FIVE H. P. AUTOMATIC GEARBOX 
IT'S GOING TO BE SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND I'M BESOTTED WITH IT 
IT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING IF YOU'RE THINKING OF BUYING AN ASTON D. B. NINE OR V. EIGHT 
NOW THAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE WOO IT IS A GOOD LOOKING THING 
BUT THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE ALTERNATIVE IT'S GOT A SISTER CAR 
THE ALFA ROMEO EIGHT C. COME ON SAY IT HE'S BEEN PRACTISING ALL WEEK HERE WE GO 
COMPETITIONE YEAH 
BRAVO 
MULTI LINGUAL SOUNDS LIKE I'VE SNEEZED BUT IT IS RELATED IT'S GOT A FORTY SEVEN LITRE V. EIGHT 
SO THE ENGINE'S SLIGHTLY BIGGER IT'S RELATED UNDERNEATH 
BUT IT'S GOT THIS BEAUTIFUL CARBON FIBRE BODY OVER THE TOP 
BUT AS AN ALTERNATIVE THERE IS A PROBLEM THEY'RE ONLY MAKING FIVE HUNDRED AND THEY'RE ALL SOLD 
BUT I THINK THAT'S BETTER LOOKING THAN THE MASERATI 
NO THE MASERATI'S BETTER PUT IT BACK UP 
I'D HAVE THAT WHY DON'T YOU ASK KRISTIN WHICH SHE'D PREFER 
I WILL IT WILL BE NICE TO TALK TO SOMEBODY INTELLIGENT 
NOW NEWS THIS WEEK OF THE MOST UNSENSIBLE CAR I'VE EVER HEARD OF 
THE VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT HERE IT IS R. THIRTY SIX 
GOT A V. SIX ENGINE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE BODY HUGGING SPORTS SEATS 
LOW PROFILE TYRES THE WHOLE NINE YARDS THING IS THOUGH 
IF YOU WANT A SPORTS SALOON THE LAST TWO WORDS THAT POP INTO YOUR HEAD 
AFTER SAY MISTER AND KIPLING ARE VOLKSWAGEN AND PASSAT 
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE IT'S LIKE SAYING SOME MORE FRUIT CAKE VICAR IT'S GOT COCAINE IN IT 
LUDICROUS 
NOW HEY ON THE WAY DOWN HERE THIS MORNING O. K. 
I SAW SOMETHING SO AMAZING THAT I TOOK A PHOTOGRAPH OF IT HERE IT IS 
I WANT TO STRESS I WASN'T DRIVING 
OBVIOUSLY NOT TAKING PICTURES YOU WERE SITTING ON THE DRIVER'S LAP BY THE LOOK OF IT 
I WAS DOING THAT 
THING IS THOUGH IT'S A PEUGEOT ONE THOUSAND SEVEN 
THEY'VE SOLD ONE SOMEBODY'S BOUGHT ONE 
SOMEBODY WENT INTO A SHOP AND SAID I'D LIKE A SMALL CAR BUT CAN YOU MAKE IT REALLY REALLY HEAVY 
WITH REALLY COMPLICATED DOORS AND I'D LIKE TO PAY MONEY FOR THAT 
I WANT TO GO FROM ZERO TO SIXTY IN EIGHTEEN SECONDS THAT'S HOW SLOW IT IS 
WHY ARE YOU IN A ROLLS ROYCE PHANTOM 
THE DAY THAT KRISTIN SCOTT THOMAS IS IN THE STUDIO 
YOU SUDDENLY DECIDE THAT YOU NEED TO TEST A PHANTOM AGAIN 
PARKED IT JUST OUTSIDE BY ANY CHANCE IT'S OUT THERE YEAH 
IS IT YEAH WHERE IT CAN BE SEEN YEAH 
I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE DO YOU THINK SHE'S GONNA BE IMPRESSED BY SOME YELLOW TOOTHED 
FAT OLD MAN WITH 
PUBES FOR HAIR 
GETTING OUT OF SOMEBODY ELSE'S ROLLS ROYCE 
AT LEAST HE'S HAD HIS PUBES CUT 
IT'S PATHETIC WE HAVE THE RESULTS OF THE TOP GEAR SURVEY 
THIS IS WHERE YOU TELL US 
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO OWN VARIOUS CARS 
FIFTY SIX THOUSAND OF YOU RESPONDED WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU ALL 
I'M DELIGHTED TO SAY THAT THE MOST SATISFYING CAR THAT YOU CAN OWN 
ACCORDING TO THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY OWN IT 
NOT JUST TEST DRIVE IT IS A CAR I'VE CHAMPIONED FOR YEARS 
THE HONDA S. TWO THOUSAND 
AGAIN OH NO NO NO WHAT DO YOU SAY IS THE BEST SMALL SPORTS CAR 
B. M. W. Z. FOUR 
WHICH CAME SIXTY SECOND 
OH AND YOU 
PORSCHE BOXTER AS I RECALL YES THAT WAS FORTY THIRD OH DEAR 
SPEAKING OF WHICH HOW ARE THE ELECTRIC WINDOWS IN YOUR PORSCHE BOXTER FINE 
STILL BROKEN NO THEY WORK I'M NOT ALWAYS IN IT WHEN THEY WORK 
HE'S VERY OFTEN IN BED WHEN THEY WORK 
WELL MAYBE BUT MY OTHER CAR THE FIAT PANDA 
I THINK I'M RIGHT IN SAYING 
YOU COULDN'T BE MORE RIGHT HE DOES HAVE A FIAT PANDA 
AND YOU'RE RIGHT JAMES IT WAS IN THE TOP TEN WITH ALL THE SKODAS 
WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING HERE IS THAT IT WAS BETTER THAN THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE 
IT'S LIKE BUYING A TON OF MANURE IT DOESN'T SMELL THAT BAD ACTUALLY 
TO BE HONEST I AM QUITE SURPRISED BY IT 
BECAUSE IT'S FUN TO DRIVE IT'S WELL MADE 
IT'S ECONOMICAL IT LOOKS GOOD 
IT SAYS ALL OF THAT IN THE MAGAZINE BUMPH BUT IT ALSO SAYS THAT PEOPLE CLAIMED IT WAS PREDICTABLY SLOW 
WHICH IT IS TELL THE AUDIENCE WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE ALL MET UP 
TO GO ON A SHOOT MET AT THE HOTEL WE HAD TO GO TO LOCATION 
I HAD AN ASTON THAT DAY AND YOU HAD A NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN 
YEAH 
WELL ALL RIGHT BUT I HAD ONLY PICKED IT UP THAT MORNING AND IT ONLY HAD EIGHT MILES ON THE CLOCK 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ALL THE KNOBS DID YET 
THERE'S ONLY TWO KNOBS IN IT THREE IF YOU COUNT THE ONE WHO BOUGHT IT 
IT'S A SIMPLE CAR 
ANYWAY I SAID I HAVEN'T GOT A MAP CAN I JUST FOLLOW YOU 
AND THEY SAID YES OF COURSE YOU CAN OFF WE GO 
AND THEY WENT OFF AT ONE TWENTY M. P. H. 
YOU SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT A FASTER CAR THEN YOU COULD HAVE KEPT UP 
YOU USED IT AS AN EXCUSE LAST NIGHT TO FONDLE MY LEG 
RUBBISH HE SAID I'LL GIVE YOU A LIFT TO THE PUB 
HE KEPT SAYING STOP TOUCHING ME 
YOU CAN'T NOT TOUCH SOMEONE 
IT'S LIKE SHARING A BATH WITH SOMEBODY GET ON THE BACK OF MY HORSE BUT DON'T TOUCH ME 
HE EXPLOITED THE DIMINUTIVE SIZE OF MY PANDA TO SIT THERE GOING OH I'M TERRIBLY SORRY 
CAN I JUST GET BACK TO THIS LIST I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE BOTTOM SIX 
THE SIX LEAST RELIABLE CARS THAT YOU CAN BUY 
SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT A TREND HERE 
SIXTH FROM LAST PEUGEOT FOUR HUNDRED SEVEN 
CITROEN C. EIGHT 
RENAULT MEGANE 
PEUGEOT THREE HUNDRED SEVEN RENAULT ESPACE 
PEUGEOT EIGHT HUNDRED SEVEN 
THEY'RE ALL FRENCH 
THE FRENCH HAVE GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO THAN GO AROUND MAKING CARS THAT'S WHAT IT WAS 
PARDON WHAT WELL FRANCE IS A LOVELY COUNTRY 
HANG ON WHERE DOES KRISTIN SCOTT THOMAS LIVE PARIS 
THAT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH YOUR SUDDEN SPIRITED DEFENCE OF FRANCE 
NO I'VE ALWAYS LIKED FRANCE 
THIS IS PATHETIC I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE LAUGHING 
YOU'D BE EXACTLY THE SAME IF GRAHAM NORTON WAS COMING ON 
NOW 
AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THESE DAYS IT'S POSSIBLE TO MAKE PETROL FROM CROPS 
AND THIS GAVE US AN IDEA 
WHY DON'T WE GIVE IT A BASH 
I MEAN HOW HARD CAN IT BE 
WELL ONE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO USE TRACTORS 
AND TRACTORS IS SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT 
SO THE PRODUCTION OFFICE SAID GO ON THE INTERNET 
DO SOME RESEARCH 
AND THEN TURN UP AT OUR TEST TRACK WITH WHICHEVER TRACTOR 
YOU THINK WOULD BE BEST FOR THE JOB OF GROWING PETROL 
RIGHT GENTLEMEN THIS IS WHAT I'VE COME UP WITH 
THAT IS THE FENDT NINE HUNDRED THIRTY VARIANT 
IT'S ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND 
THIS IS THE MERCEDES S. CLASS 
OF AGRICULTURAL VEHICLES 
THIS HAS GOT EVERY SINGLE TOY IMAGINABLE 
BEST OF ALL IT'S GOT THIS COMPUTER AND IT WILL MAINTAIN IT 
AT A CONSTANT SPEED OF ZERO ZERO SIX M. P. H. 
THAT'S THE FASTEST HE'S EVER BEEN 
JEREMY'S CHOICE TURNED UP NEXT 
THERE IS IS 
JEREMY THAT'S A DIGGER NO IT ISN'T 
THAT IS A J. C. B. FAST TRACK SOMETHING OR OTHER 
AND THIS IS THE TRACTOR THAT THE ARMY USE 
OH THE ARMY WELL KNOWN ALL OVER THE WORLD AS FARMERS 
IT HAS WHAT 
IT HAS 
AN EIGHTY THREE LITRE TURBOCHARGED ENGINE 
UNLIKE ANY OTHER TRACTOR I THINK TOP SPEED'S UNLIMITED 
NO 
NO LISTEN SERIOUSLY IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE GOOD QUALITY PETROL 
FROM OUR CROP YEAH 
WE WANT TO GET THE PLOUGHING DONE WELL NOT QUICKLY 
WHICH IS WHY 
I HAVE BOUGHT THIS 
THAT'S A BLOODY TANK YOU IDIOT 
IT DIDN'T LOOK THAT BIG ON MY COMPUTER TO BE HONEST 
IT'S A CASE S. T. X. STEIGER THAT HAS GOT 
A SIXTEEN LITRE TURBOCHARGED ENGINE 
IT WEIGHS TWENTY FOUR TONNES IT'S JUST 
HOW MUCH IS IT 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY SIX 
WHAT'S ITS TOP SPEED 
TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY 
FORTY ONE 
SO THIS IS THEREFORE A FASTER PLOUGHER 
YOU CAN'T PLOUGH AT FORTY ONE M. P. H. 
HOW FAST DO YOU PLOUGH I DON'T KNOW 
OUR IGNORANCE ABOUT FARMING WAS A LITTLE EMBARRASSING 
SO WE DIVED INTO THE FIRST CHALLENGE 
READY IT'S THE BIG MOMENT 
FARMING HAS A VERY HIGH SUICIDE RATE 
WHICH CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO STRESS 
THE LAST THING YOU NEED THEREFORE IS A TRACTOR THAT'S CONFUSING TO OPERATE 
SO TO TEST USER FRIENDLINESS YOU MUST HITCH UP A TRAILER 
GET IN ADJUST THE SEAT 
TURN ON THE LIGHTS AND THEN REVERSE YOUR RIG THROUGH OUR CAR PARK 
OH HO HO HO 
QUITE BIG SOME OF THESE THINGS 
IT'S A TIGHT CAR PARK THAT 
AND UNFORTUNATELY IT'S ALWAYS FULL OF STUFF 
ON THAT DAY FOR EXAMPLE 
THERE WAS A VERY EXPENSIVE MODIFIED RANGE ROVER SPORT 
A PROTOTYPE ASTRA WITH A NEW TYPE OF DIESEL ENGINE 
AND ALL OUR CHERISHED T. V. CREATIONS 
JAMES WENT FIRST AND INSTANTLY REGRETTED CHOOSING THE S. CLASS 
FIFTEEN MINUTES JAMES AND UTTER SILENCE 
JUST MAKING SURE EVERYTHING'S RIGHT BEFORE I START START IT NOW THEN 
IT'S VERY QUIET THAT'S AMAZING MODERN TRACTORS 
EVENTUALLY HE DID GET IT STARTED 
THEN HE HAD TO FIND FIRST GEAR 
THAT'S SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE HYDRAULICS IT'S NOT THAT 
THAT'S 
IT'S NOW BEEN TWENTY SIX MINUTES 
HANG ON 
FIRST THE WINDSCREEN WIPER 
DO YOU THINK HE'S FOUND THE GEAR LEVER 
IT'S TAKEN HIM THIRTY FOUR MINUTES 
I'VE MANAGED TO ADJUST THE STEERING WHEEL 
IT CAN'T BE THAT DIFFICULT 
YOU WILL NOTICE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THAT ONE HOUR HAS PASSED 
AND THE TRACTOR'S NO NEARER 
HOW DID I DO 
DON'T HOLD OUT TOO MANY HOPES 
UNBELIEVABLY I HAD NO TROUBLE GETTING MY J. C. B. STARTED AND INTO GEAR 
IT MOVES IT LIVES 
HITCHING THE TRAILER WAS A DODDLE TOO 
YES 
ALL I HAD TO DO NOW WAS REVERSE IT 
THIS OF COURSE IS A FOUR WHEEL TRAILER 
SLIGHTLY HARDER TO OPERATE 
IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU THINK 
WRONG 
GETTING WRONGER 
OH 
HOW CAN YOU CRASH INTO YOUR OWN TRAILER 
NO 
OH THIS IS STUPID THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT JEREMY IS HE THINKS PROBLEMS CAN BE SOLVED BY SHOUTING 
THIS IS JUST RIDICULOUS 
IT CAN'T BE DONE 
HE'S GETTING FURTHER AWAY 
I'M NOT A QUITTER 
BUT I'M QUITTING 
HAMMOND BEING A COUNTRY BOY INSTANTLY BONDED WITH THE JOB IN HAND 
HERE WE GO 
THAT IS REALLY ANNOYING 
YEAH YOU SEE 
I'M ON A ROLL 
STOP STOP STOP STOP 
I THINK I DID CLIP IT 
HOW MANY OF THESE WERE THERE 
NONE 
SINCE YOU DID THAT 
HOW DID YOU 
IT WEIGHS TWENTY FOUR TONNES YOU WERE GOING IN A. YOU CAN'T SEE MUCH WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING BACKWARDS 
FRANKLY WE'D ALL MADE A HASH OF THAT CHALLENGE AND IT WAS PROBABLY BEST TO MOVE ON 
RIGHT THEN TIME FOR OUR NEXT CHALLENGE YES THANK YOU 
AND HERE IT IS 
THE SLOWEST THING EVER TO LAP OUR TRACK WAS THE LATE RICHARD WHITELEY 
HE WENT ROUND IN TWO MINUTES SIX SECONDS 
CAN YOUR TRACTORS BEAT THIS 
WHAT GO SLOWER THAN THAT 
YEAH THAT'S STUPID 
WHAT'S TO STOP YOU DRIVING REALLY SLOWLY 
WE WON'T BE DRIVING THE STIG WILL OH GOD 
IS HE THE SLOWEST OR THE FASTEST 
NO IT'S THE SLOWEST 
I'VE BROUGHT THE FASTEST TRACTOR DOWN HERE 
THIS IS EXCELLENT 
AND WITH ITS TOP SPEED OF THIRTY ONE THE STIG 
COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN LESS BOTHERED 
ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF A LAP IN THE FENDT 
TWO ONE GO 
THAT'S GOOD THAT'S GOOD 
HE DOESN'T EXACTLY SPIN HIS WHEELS 
AND IT'S ONE MINUTE NOW 
AND HE HASN'T MADE IT TO CHICAGO 
TWO MINUTES ONE TWO THREE 
COMING UP TO WHITELEY'S TIME SIX 
IS HE HERE NO HE ISN'T 
THE STIG'S PERFORMANCE ALSO WASN'T HELPED BY THE FACT 
THAT JAMES HAD ADJUSTED THE SEAT TO ITS SOFTEST SETTING 
OH MY GOD 
YAY 
WHAT WAS IT THREE MINUTES THREE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT 
SPECTACULARLY SLOW 
HOPEFULLY MY OFFICE BLOCK WOULD BEAT ERM NOT BEAT I MEAN 
THAT TIME 
WHEEL SPIN 
NO THAT'S BAD I DON'T WANT WHEEL SPIN 
IT'S GONE ALL QUIET 
WELL HOW DO YOU COMMENTATE ON A TRACTOR LAP 
GOING ROUND THE HAMMERHEAD 
THE LAMBORGHINI TRACTOR THEY'LL DO IT ALL THE COLOURS 
SORRY TO INTERRUPT BUT WILL HE UNDERSTEER 
GOING ROUND THE HAMMERHEAD 
NO AS I WAS SAYING 
YOU'RE RIGHT WE HAVE BEEN LUCKY WITH THIS 
BARELY A CLOUD 
NO GORGEOUS WEATHER 
I WONDER IF THINGS STAY HOT IN THE THERMOS FLASK 
FOR LESS TIME THAN THEY STAY COLD 
DON'T GO THERE HOW DOES IT KEEP THEM HOT 
AS WE FINISHED AFTERNOON TEA THE STIG ROMPED HOME 
COME ON YES 
NDS 
THEN THE SPEEDY J. C. B. GTI 
THAT TIME WOULDN'T BE EASY TO NOT BEAT WAIT NO HANG ON 
IT'S LEANING OF COURSE IT'S LEANING IT'S A VERY VERY POWERFUL 
IN FACT THE J. C. B. GTI WAS SO FAST THAT EVEN THE STIG HAD TROUBLE COPING 
COME ON NO SLOW IS GOOD YOU FOOL 
THE LAST CORNER TURNING IN 
CROSSED THE LINE READ IT AND WEEP 
TWO MINUTES FIFTY SEVEN 
NO THAT'S NO JEREMY 
THE SLOWEST WINS RUBBISH 
HOPEFULLY THERE'D BE NO DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE FINAL CHALLENGE 
THE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS FOR ANY TRACTOR 
ARE FUEL EFFICIENCY 
RELIABILITY AND LONG SERVICE LIFE 
SO YOUR NEXT CHALLENGE IS A DRAG RACE 
OH GOD 
I'VE GOT THIS ONE COMPLETELY SEWN UP 
NO YOU HAVEN'T YOU'VE MISUNDERSTOOD 
IT'S A DRAG RACE 
WE EACH HAVE TO LOOK AROUND THE WHOLE OF THE TOP GEAR SITE 
AND FIND SOMETHING BIG AND HEAVY TO DRAG IN THE RACE 
MORE POINTS FOR THE BIGGER AND HEAVIER THING WE DRAG AH 
I HITCHED UP JEREMY'S TOYOTA HILUX 
THE S. CLASS COUNTRY COTTAGE 
MY TRIUMPH HERALD SAILING BOAT 
AND WELL A FEW OTHER THINGS 
NICE TRY BUT A BIT WET 
EVEN THE OFFICE'S LACK OF WHEELS 
WAS NO PROBLEM FOR MY METAL MAMMOTH'S ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TORQUES 
AGAIN GOOD EFFORT 
RIGHT 
I'LL THINK LOW RANGE 
THREE TWO ONE GO 
THIS IS IT WE ARE AWAY 
IN THE MOST RIDICULOUS DRAG RACE IN HISTORY 
THE CARS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE 
CONVOY'S SNAKING A BIT 
IT'S SNAKING A LOT 
NOT QUITE AS SPRIGHTLY AS I WAS HOPING 
COME ON COME ON 
I'VE REACHED AFTER TWENTY FIVE SECONDS THIRTEEN M. P. H. 
THE FIRST ONE IS FAST IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE 
THERE'S A BIG WEAVE GOING ON 
WHOA LAST ONE 
WHOA CAR IN THE WAY 
IT'S GONNA BE A DISASTER 
HERE'S THE FINISHING LINE 
NOT THE MOST ELEGANT FINISH BUT I BELIEVE I'VE BEATEN OLD MCHAMMOND 
WAKE ME UP WHEN WE GET THERE 
NOW OBVIOUSLY WE WILL BE PICKING THAT UP LATER ON WHEN WE START GROWING PETROL 
BUT NOW IT'S TIME TO PUT A STAR IN OUR REASONABLY PRICED CAR 
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A HOLLYWOOD STAR 
SHE'S CURRENTLY STARRING ON THE WEST END STAGE IN ONE OF THE GREAT CLASSICS 
SHE'S THE EPITOME OF COOL 
IS YOUR HEART FLUTTERING AS YOU TALK ABOUT HER 
HAS YOUR TONGUE GONE REALLY BIG IN YOUR MOUTH 
WILL YOU TWO GROW UP 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PLEASE WELCOME KRISTIN SCOTT THOMAS 
HOW ARE YOU GOOD 
HAVE A SEAT 
WELL THAT'S IT 
AND MY LIFE IS NOW COMPLETE 
SO HAS IT BEEN THE MOST HORRIBLE DAY OF YOUR LIFE NO 
NO I ENJOYED IT I ENJOYED DRIVING FAST AND 
RELATIVELY DANGEROUSLY 
WELL IT WASN'T FAST IT WAS VERY FAST FOR ME 
WAS IT COS I'M VERY SLOW 
I USUALLY DRIVE WITH MY NOSE ON THE WINDSCREEN 
SO YOU'RE OVER HERE STARRING IN A PLAY 
DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE LIVING IN LONDON 
DURING THE PLAY YEAH 
SO WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AROUND LONDON 
A G. WIZ 
G. WIZ THE LITTLE ELECTRIC 
NICE CAR I'VE ALWAYS LIKED THEM ERM 
I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT'S A LIE 
IT'S ALL JUST A NONSENSE PEOPLE HAVE MISQUOTED ME 
I'M THINKING OF GETTING ONE 
YOU SHOULD BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'D FIT IN IT 
I WOULD I'D SAW BITS OFF 
AND I'D GET IN 
MINE'S GOT TIGER STRIPES ALL OVER IT 
IT'S VERY ATTRACTIVE AS WELL I LIKE THAT IDEA 
NOW YOU LIVE IN PARIS MOST OF THE TIME 
HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO LONDON 
ERM TRAFFIC'S WORSE 
I LIKE DRIVING IN PARIS I DON'T LIKE DRIVING IN LONDON 
IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN DRIVING STYLE THAT TO ADJUST TO 
WELL YEAH I GOT FOUR TRAFFIC OFFENCES IN MY FIRST WEEK IN LONDON 
IN A G. WIZ NO WAY 
OBVIOUSLY NOT SPEEDING 
NO 
THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT 
YOU DID DESCRIBE DRIVING ROUND THE ARC DE TRIOMPHE AS A GREAT ADVENTURE 
I LOVE IT IT'S FANTASTICALLY FRIGHTENING 
I DID IT ONCE IN A FORD G. T. THAT WAS TRICKY 
WHAT'S A FORD G. T. 
NOT A PARTICULARLY NICE CAR 
IT DAMAGES THE ENVIRONMENT BADLY I DON'T LIKE IT 
BUT THERE IS A MOMENT WHERE YOU JUST GET TO THE ARC DE TRIOMPHE 
AND IT'S LIKE HERE WE GO 
IT'S GREAT FUN THE TRICK WITH THE ARC DE TRIOMPHE 
YOU HAVE TO NOT LOOK WHO'S COMING AT YOU 
LOOK WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND HAVE A BADLY BEATEN UP CAR 
YEAH NEVER TRY IT IN A NICE CAR 
ALWAYS THE WORST CAR YOU CAN LAY YOUR HANDS ON 
THEN EVERYONE WILL AVOID YOU 
THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS I'VE GOT YOU AS THE COOL WALL MUSE

YES 
I HAVEN'T GOT MY SPECS ON 
SORRY MATE YOU DESCRIBED IT AS A WART LAST YEAR

YOU SEE THAT ISN'T IN THE BROCHURE 
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY WHEN I SAID IT WAS A WART I WAS THINKING MORE OF CINDY CRAWFORD'S BEAUTY SPOT

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN KRISTIN SCOTT THOMAS 
NOW THIS IS A SUPERCAR 
IT'S BUILT PRIMARILY TO BE FAST 
BUT ABOVE SUPERCARS THERE'S ANOTHER LEVEL HYPERCARS 
AND THOSE ARE MOSTLY ABOUT SHOWING OFF 
WHICH IS WHAT YOU WERE DOING IN THAT INTERVIEW A BIT 
YOU'VE LET THE PROGRAMME AND YOURSELF DOWN 
YOU'RE AN EMBARRASSMENT ANYWAY HE DOES HAVE A POINT O. K. 
SUPERCARS ARE DESIGNED TO MESS WITH G. FORCES 
HYPERCARS ARE DESIGNED TO MESS WITH G. STRINGS 
KING OF THE HYPERCAR MAKERS HAS ALWAYS BEEN LAMBORGHINI 
CARS LIKE THE DIABLO THE COUNTACH THEY WERE BRILLIANT CARS TO LOOK AT 
THEY MADE YOU FEEL YOU WERE TEN YEARS OLD 
BUT THE FACT IS THEY WERE ALWAYS HORRID TO DRIVE 
THEY WERE THEY WERE DESIGNED FOR ROD STEWART NOT JACKIE STEWART 
SO YOU'RE PROBABLY EXPECTING MORE OF THE SAME FROM THE LATEST PRODUCT 
THE MURCIELAGO L. P. SIX FORTY 
HERE IT IS AND OF COURSE IT'S VERY DRAMATIC 
IT'S ALSO VERY LARGE AND IT TURNS A GREAT MANY HEADS AS YOU DRIVE ALONG 
PLUS IT MAKES LOTS OF NOISE 
BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT IT IT'S NOT THAT OUTLANDISH 
IT WAS ACTUALLY STYLED BY A BELGIAN 
THE SAME CHAP WHO DID THE AUDI A TWO 
AND THERE ARE NO BIG SPOILERS SPROUTING OUT OF IT 
THERE ARE NO ROTATING KNIVES THERE AREN'T EVEN ANY MACHINE GUNS 
THE VENTS ONLY OPEN WHEN THE ENGINE GETS REALLY HOT 
THE REST OF THE TIME THEY'RE HIDDEN AWAY 
THERE'S A GIANT OIL COOLING APERTURE ON ONE SIDE OF THE CAR 
BUT INSTEAD OF FITTING A FAKE ON THE OTHER THEY HAVEN'T BOTHERED 
THERE'S NO STYLE FOR STYLE'S SAKE HERE 
AND LOOK AT THE EXHAUST PIPE 
IT'S THE SAME WIDTH AS THE CHANNEL TUNNEL 
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE NOT SEVENTEEN LIKE YOU GET IN MOST HYPERCARS 
YOU EVEN GET A DEVICE THAT RAISES THE NOSE FOR GOING OVER SPEED HUMPS 
THIS ALL FINE BUT WHAT'S THE POINT OF A LAMBORGHINI 
THAT DOESN'T HAVE SPACE THRUSTERS STICKING OUT OF THE SIDE 
OF COURSE YOU STILL GET SCISSOR DOORS 
AND WHEN YOU STEP INSIDE 
THE STEERING WHEEL ISN'T QUITE IN FRONT OF WHERE YOU'RE SITTING 
BUT THERE IS ROOM FOR YOUR HEAD AND YOU CAN SEE OUT 
AND EVEN SEE BEHIND 
THEN WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING ALONG NORMALLY 
IT FEELS VERY CIVILIZED 
OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT A HONDA CIVIC 
YOU CAN'T TURN LEFT BECAUSE THE INDICATOR STALK'LL HIT YOUR KNEE 
AND IT DOES EIGHT MILES TO THE GALLON 
OR FOUR 
BUT THAT SAID YOU DON'T HAVE TO RAISE YOUR VOICE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION 
IT'S GOT SATELLITE NAVIGATION AND AIR CONDITIONING 
WHICH UNLIKE THE AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS OF LAMBOS OF OLD ISN'T LIKE BEING COUGHED ON BY A MOUSE 
THIS IS ALL VERY WORRYING 
YOU SEE IT'S EIGHT YEARS SINCE THE CAPTAIN SENSIBLES AT AUDI TOOK OVER LAMBORGHINI 
AND NOW THEY SEEM TO BE TAKING AWAY ITS SOUL 
THE ONLY REASON WE EVER LIKED LAMBORGHINIS IS BECAUSE THEY WERE SILLY 
TAKING THAT AWAY IS LIKE TAKING THE SUNSHINE FROM A SUMMER HOLIDAY 
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING 
AUDI HAVE REPLACED THE LUNACY WITH SOMETHING ELSE 
THEY'VE INCREASED THE SIZE OF THE V. TWELVE 
FROM SIXTY TWO TO SIXTY FIVE LITRES 
BUT WHAT IT DELIVERS IS SIMPLY STAGGERING 
YOU GET FIVE HUNDRED CARBON DIOXIDES AND SIX HUNDRED FORTY BRAKE HORSEPOWER 
THAT'S MORE THAN YOU GET FROM A PORSCHE CARRERA G. T. 
OR A MCLAREN MERCEDES S. L. R. IT'S MORE THAN YOU GET FROM A ZONDA 
THE RESULT IS SPECTACULAR 
THIS IS NOT A LIGHT CAR BUT MY GOD IT'S FAST 
PROPERLY SAVAGELY FAST 
NOUGHT TO SIXTY TAKES THREE AND A BIT SECONDS 
ITS TOP SPEED IS TWO HUNDRED AND 
I TELL YOU WHAT LET'S FIND OUT 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY 
THE FASTEST ANYTHING'S GONE DOWN HERE IS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED NINETY 
THAT'S TWO HUNDRED WE'RE QUICKER THAN ANYTHING EVE R. 
TWO HUNDRED SEVEN 
TWO HUNDRED SEVEN MILES AN HOUR 
NOW OF COURSE FIGURES LIKE THIS ARE SORT OF MEANINGLESS 
THEY'RE HARD TO GET YOUR HEAD ROUND 
BUT WHAT I'VE DONE IS ORGANISED A DEMONSTRATION 
WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A GOLF G. T. I. 
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HALF MILE DRAG RACE 
TO SHOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FAST CAR 
AND A MURCIELAGO 
NOW THIS HAS FORMULA ONE STYLE LAUNCH CONTROL 
YOU HIT THE SPORT BUTTON IN A MURCIELAGO 
TURN THE TRACTION CONTROL OFF THEN FLOOR THE THROTTLE 
WHEN THE REVS HIT FOUR THOUSAND THE CLUTCH WILL BANG IN AND WE'LL BE OFF 
WOW 
GOLF'S GONE 
BIG WOW 
NOW YOU MIGHT IMAGINE THAT THIS SORT OF POWER DOESN'T COME CHEAP 
AND THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT ON THE OPTIONS LIST 
A LITTLE BIT OF CARBON FIBRE ON THE CENTRE CONSOLE FOUR THOUSAND 
CARBON BRAKES SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY 
IF YOU WANT THE BRAKE CALLIPERS PAINTING 
SIX HUNDRED TRANSPARENT ENGINE COVER DO YOU SEE THAT ON THE BACK 
FOUR THOUSAND 
FLAP AND PADDLE GEARBOX SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
YOU'D NEED A FLAT AND PADDLE HEAD TO SPEND THAT 
OH 
BUT AMAZINGLY THE ACTUAL CAR ONLY COSTS ONE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND 
THAT'S ABOUT HALF WHAT YOU'D PAY FOR A NORMAL HYPERCAR 
SO IT'S QUITE WELL PRICED IT'S HUGELY POWERFUL 
AND IT'S SURPRISINGLY ELEGANT 
BUT DO NOT FOR ONE MINUTE BE TRICKED INTO THINKING 
THAT THE KING OF THE HYPERCARS HAS BECOME A SUPERCAR 
IN THE TWISTY STUFF IT'S STILL A CARD CARRYING LUNATIC 
YOU TAKE ONE LIBERTY WITH IT 
AND TRUST ME ON THIS YOU ARE GOING DOWN 
THERE WE GO INTO THE BEND AND WE'RE GOING BACKWARDS 
A LIABILITY 
SO 
IT'S STILL REALLY A CAR FOR SHOW OFFS AND NOT DRIVERS 
IT'S KIND OF HALFWAY YOU SEE 
IF YOU WERE IN A SUPERCAR AND YOU REACHED THE LIMIT OF GRIP 
IT WILL START TO SLIDE AND YOU CAN HOLD THAT SLIDE 
ON AN AIRFIELD IT DOESN'T MATTER THIS FOUR WHEEL DRIVE 
SO YOU'VE GOT TONS OF GRIP THEN WHEN YOU GET TO THE LIMIT IT'S OFF 
IT'S A DIM WITTED FOUR WHEEL DRIVE SYSTEM SOMEHOW 
YOU CANNOT PUSH IT BEYOND THE LIMIT 
YOU CAN'T DRIVE IT TO THE LIMIT OR ANYWHERE NEAR THE LIMIT 
THE PUNISHMENT FOR OVERDOING IT BY ONE PER CENT IS CERTAIN DEATH 
ABSOLUTELY HAPPILY HOWEVER 
WE HAVE A MAN ON THE TEAM WHO LAUGHS IN THE FACE OF DEATH 
SOME SAY THAT HE SUCKS THE MOISTURE FROM DUCKS 
AND THAT HIS CRASH HELMET IS MODELLED ON BRITNEY SPEARS'S HEAD 
ALL WE KNOW IS HE'S CALLED THE STIG 
AND HE'S OFF SHOW OFF OR NOT THIS IS STILL A FIERCELY QUICK CAR 
BUT CAN IT KNOCK THE KOENIGSEGG OFF THE TOP OF OUR LAP BOARD 
SEE IF IT DOESN'T BITE STIG IN THE FACE ON THE WAY 
O. K. SO FAR 
THE LOVE MAKING WAS HESITANT AND TENDER 
HE DIDN'T HURT OR FRIGHTEN HER 
MORE ROMANTIC FICTION DRIVEL THERE AS HE POWERS ROUND CHICAGO 
KEEPING IT VERY TIDY WHICH HE HAS TO DO 
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T STICK THE TAIL OUT 
INTO HAMMERHEAD 
YES LOOK AT THAT 
HE'S ABSOLUTELY KEEPING IT ON THE RAGGEDY EDGE 
BUT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PART OF ALL WAS HER SMILE 
RIGHT LET'S SEE WHAT THE LAMBO CAN DO NOW 
THIS IS WHERE HE CAN UNLEASH THAT FEARSOME FIREPOWER 
THAT IS QUICK 
TWO CORNERS LEFT 
HE TRUCKS IT IN RIGHT ON THE LIMIT 
BELTS UP TO GAMBON TURNING IN 
KEEPING THE TAIL IN CHECK AND ACROSS THE LINE 
WHERE DO YOU THINK IT CAME 
FOURTH FOURTH 
NOT FOURTH 
NOT FOURTH 
IT CAME 
LOOK AT THAT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
SECOND FOURTH SIXTH PLACE 
ONE POINT EIGHT THE SAME AS THE CARRERA G. T. 
THE SIXTH FASTEST CAR 
THAT'S A HYPERCAR 
NOW LAST YEAR WE DECIDED TO GROW OUR OWN PETROL 
AND EARLIER ON IN THE SHOW YOU SAW US TESTING THREE TRACTORS 
TO DECIDE WHICH ONE WOULD BE BEST FOR THE JOB 
AND WE COULDN'T DECIDE SO WE TOOK ALL THREE 
YES WE HAD THE TRACTORS 
AND NOW IT WAS TIME TO START FARMING 
THIS IS B. B. C. RADIO FOUR 
NOW IT'S FARMING TODAY GOOD MORNING A NEW REPORT 
THIS IS THE TWENTY FIVE ACRE FIELD 
WHERE WE'LL BE GROWING OUR FIRST CROP OF TOP GEAR PETROL 
WE HAD JUST ONE DAY TO GET IT SOWN AND IMMEDIATELY THERE WAS A PROBLEM 
BEFORE WE COULD START PLOUGHING THIS LOT WOULD HAVE TO BE EVICTED 
HOW DO YOU CLEAR SHEEP 
CALL FRED DIBNAH 
HE'S DEAD NOT DIBNAH IS IT IT'S 
FRED DRABBLE 
YOU MEAN PHIL DRABBLE 
HE'S DEAD AS WELL 
SO WHAT SHALL WE DO 
WE COULD USE DYNAMITE 
EVENTUALLY THE JOB WAS GIVEN TO HAMMOND AND TOP GEAR DOG 
T. G. ROUND THEM UP COME ON 
T. G. COME ON 
WHO DIDN'T SEEM TO BE IN THE MOOD 
T. G. COME HERE 
THIS IS JUST ME DOING IT THIS IS STUPID 
MEANWHILE JAMES AND I SET ABOUT THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE DAY 
IT'S VERY SIMPLE OUR RENTED FIELD IS TWENTY FIVE ACRES BIG 
THE FIELD WHERE WE'RE CURRENTLY FILMING ONE DOG AND HIS MAN 
T. G. JUST ROUND ONE UP 
AND WE'RE GONNA PLANT THIS IT'S OILSEED RAPE 
WHEN IT'S HARVESTED WE SHOULD GET FIFTEEN TONS OF RAPESEED OIL 
YEAH THEN WE'RE GOING TO RENT IT'S LIKE A DISTILLING MACHINE YES 
ANYONE CAN DO THAT THAT WILL CONVERT THOSE FIFTEEN TONS INTO 
THREE THOUSAND GALLONS OF PETROL 
AND THAT'S ENOUGH TO GET MY FORD G. T. TO THE SHOPS AND BACK ABSOLUTELY 
AND IT'S ALSO ENOUGH TO DRIVE A TYPICAL FAMILY C. A R. NINE ZERO ZERO ZERO MILES 
NO JUST GO THE OTHER WAY 
THAT WAY 
HURRY UP 
THAT'S A USELESS DOG HE'S USELESS 
NOT ONE 
EVENTUALLY THE SHEEPS WERE CLEARED BY A PROPER DOG 
SO WE COULD GET GOING WITH OUR TRACTORS 
BUT THAT GAVE US ANOTHER PROBLEM 
GUYS 
IS THIS THE ONLY WAY INTO THE FIELD 
IT WAS 
AND IT WASN'T EXACTLY THE WORK OF BRUNEL 
NEVERTHELESS JAMES CREPT OVER SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY IN HIS FENDT 
AND THEN I WENT OVER IN MY SPORTS TRACTOR 
FOUR IT 
OOH 
SO FAST THAT I BROKE IT 
THIS SEEMED TO ANNOY HAMMOND 
THIS WEIGHS TWENTY FOUR TONS YOU'VE BROKEN IT WITH HALF OF THAT 
L. L. SEE IF I CAN WAIT A MINUTE 
THEN WE MADE THINGS WORSE 
AVOID THAT BIT 
WHO CHOSE THIS FIELD 
WE SPENT AGES TRYING TO HELP HIM 
OH FORGET IT MATE 
THIS WEIGHS HALF A TON 
I CAN'T EVEN LIFT IT THIS END 
CAN YOU JUST GO TO THIS SIDE AND AVOID THAT BIT OF COURSE 
I'LL GO ON ONE SIDE OF THE WEAK BRIDGE 
COME ON 
IF HE FALLS IN I'M GOING TO DIE LAUGHING OH 
TO AVOID THE BROKEN SLEEPER I HAD TO GO RIGHT OVER THE EDGE 
I CAN'T SEE I CANNOT SEE ANYTHING I'VE NO IDEA WHAT IT'S DOING 
STRAIGHT FOR A BIT 
O. K. STRAIGHT COME FORWARDS 
STOP STOP 
OH 
PIECE OF CAKE 
NOW WE WERE IN THE FIELD OUR FIRST JOB WAS TO PLOUGH IT 
AND HAMMOND HAD GONE FOR SOME MACHINERY FROM I THINK 
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA 
HAVE YOU SEEN THE SIZE OF MY PLOUGH 
OH YEAH 
NOT SURE THIS IS THE WEATHER FOR PLOUGHING 
BECAUSE OF OUR TRAINING WE HAD NO PROBLEM GETTING OUR PLOUGHS HITCHED 
AND THEN WE GOT INTO OUR PLOUGHING POSITIONS 
RIGHT WE'VE DIVIDED THE FIELD UP INTO THREE EQUAL PARTS 
EACH OF US GETS TWO TELEGRAPH POLES 
YES THEN WE'RE GONNA SEE WHO CAN DO THEIR PLOUGHING THE FASTEST 
NO WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHO CAN DO IT THE BEST 
AND BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING 
ABOUT PLOUGHING WE'VE INVITED SOME PLOUGHING JUDGES 
WHO JUDGE PLOUGHING 
AND THEY EXPLAINED TO JAMES JUST WHAT THEY'D BE LOOKING FOR 
EVERY FURROW ABSOLUTELY IDENTICAL IN EVERY WAY 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR ALL THE TRASH TO BE BURIED 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR NO DIPS AND MOUNDS A GOOD SEEDBED FOR THE NEXT CROP 
YOU SOUND LIKE A YORKSHIREMAN ARE YOU I AM A YORKSHIREMAN 
I USED TO LIVE IN YORKSHIRE WHEREABOUTS DONCASTER JEREMY'S FROM DONCASTER 
HE IS FROM DONCASTER I KNOW HIS MOTHER VERY WELL 
DO YOU AND I KNEW HIM WHEN HE WAS IN SCHOOL 
SO YOU LIKE HIM I WOULDN'T SAY I LIKE WELL 
WE WERE READY TO PLOUGH 
HERE WE GO I KNOW WHAT TO DO THREE TWO 
ONE GO 
THEME FROM DALLAS 
I'M PLOUGHING HERE WE GO 
AH DIFFLOCK ONE DIFFLOCK TWO 
EH OIL TO PLOUGH 
THIS IS GONNA BE THE FASTEST PIECE OF PLOUGHING EVER 
THAT'S NUMBER TWO PLOUGH IN POSITION 
SO I WAS STRUGGLING WITH MY ROBO PLOUGH 
JAMES WAS TRUNDLING ALONG LIKE WORZEL GUMMIDGE 
AND JEREMY WAS GOING LIKE A BAT WITH NO SENSE OF DIRECTION AT ALL 
OH YEAH THIS IS EASY NOW 
THE JUDGES WERE NOT IMPRESSED 
MARKS FOR STRAIGHTNESS OUT OF TEN 
A HALF 
STILL AT LEAST I WAS DOING BETTER THAN JAMES 
WHAT'S HE DOING 
MAY YOU IMBECILE 
YOU'VE GOT THE ENTIRE EARTH STUCK TO THE BACK OF YOUR PLOUGH 
MEANWHILE RICHARD HAD FINALLY SET OFF IN THE STARSHIP ENTERPLOUGH 
BUT THE MOMENT HE TRIED TO TURN ROUND DISASTER 
METALLIC TWANG 
I'VE SHEARED A BOLT THAT'S BAD 
SO IT'S JUST DOWN TO ME 
SPORTSTRACS WAS THE ONLY THAT COULD DO THIS JOB HAVE YOU SEEN THE SIZE OF THE BOLT I SHEARED 
SEEN THE BOLTS 
MORE THAN ONE 
WITH JAMES'S TRACTOR BEACHED AND HAMMOND'S BROKEN SORRY 
MINE WAS THE ONLY ONE STILL RUNNING 
IT'S ONE HUNDRED THIRTY IN THE AFTERNOON AND I FRANKLY CAN'T SEE US GETTING THIS DONE 
IN A WEEK 
IF WE WERE GOING TO GET OUR CROP PLANTED BY THE END OF THE DAY 
I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO BREAK OUT MY INGENUITY 
AND USE A METHOD OF PLOUGHING 
THEY CERTAINLY WOULDN'T THINK OF ON THE ARCHERS 
FIRE IN THE HOLE 
WHAT 
GOOD PLOUGHING DONE 
WITH OUR FARMING BACK ON SCHEDULE 
WE COULD AFFORD TO HAVE A SPOT OF LUNCH 
AND THAT SPARKED ONE OF THE GREAT DEBATES OF THE COUNTRYSIDE 
WHAT'S IN A PLOUGHMAN'S 
CHEESE CHEESE THERE'S ALWAYS CHEESE CHEDDAR YES OR STILTON STILTON 
NO YOU CAN'T HAVE I CAN'T STAND PLOUGHMAN'S WITH PONCEY CHEESE 
HOW CAN YOU CALL STILTON PONCEY THAT'S THE LEAST PONCEY CHEESE IN THE WORLD 
PIECE OF STALE BREAD HARD CHEDDAR AND A PICKLE OF SOME SORT THAT'S ALL THEY'D HAVE HAD 
APPLE ONLY IN SEASON 
AND THE APPLE SEASON COINCIDES WITH THE PLOUGHING SEASON YOU PILLOCK 
PICKLED ONIONS YES YES BRANSTON PICKLE APPLE 
AN APPLE CHEESE CHEESE CHEDDAR OR STILTON I DON'T WANT ANOTHER ROW WITH HIM LETTUCE 
NO LETTUCE NO EVENTUALLY WE MADE A DECISION 
AND HAMMOND WAS NOMINATED TO GO OFF AND BUY OUR LUNCH 
I HAVEN'T GOT A CAR YOU'LL HAVE TO USE YOUR TRACTOR 
BLIMEY 
FOURTEENTH IS A BIT OF A SHARP GEAR IT REALLY GOES 
WITH HAMMOND'S TWENTY FOUR TON RUNABOUT BEARING DOWN ON THE NEAREST VILLAGE 
JAMES AND I SET ABOUT OUR NEXT JOB 
CULTIVATING BREAKING UP THE PLOUGHED SOIL 
AND THIS DEMANDED SOME SERIOUS TRACTOR CUSTOMISING 
I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF THAT SKY 
NOT FOR CULTIVATING 
MEANWHILE IN THE LOCAL VILLAGE HAMMOND WAS BLENDING IN NICELY 
THAT'S A BIT TIGHT 
OH GOT ALARMS GOING OFF 
SORRY 
JAMES WAS AS MUCH USE AT CULTIVATING 
AS HE HAD BEEN AT PLOUGHING 
JAMES WHAT ARE YOU DOING I'M DOING MY PRE CULTIVATION CHECKS 
THANK YOU JETHRO 
I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST THING WE'VE EVER FILMED 
THAT I CAN DO IT AND THOSE TWO CAN'T 
AH 
I'VE HIT THE TELEGRAPH POLE 
JAMES I'M BEGGING YOU NOW JUST TO 
DRIVE A TRACTOR INTO THE FIELD AND DO CULTIVATING 
MERCY JAMES MERCY JUST FOR ONCE 
RIGHT TWO HYDRAULIC TUBES TOP LINK ATTACHED 
COME DOWN ONE SIDE OF THE FENCE OR THE OTHER PLOUGHMAN'S LUNCH STILTON OR CHEDDAR 
STILTON 
YOU SEE JAMES MAY'S TALKING RUBBISH 
PLOUGHMAN'S LUNCH IS OH THAT'S A BUS 
I SENSED THAT THE LOCALS HAD HAD ENOUGH 
BEFORE I LEFT TOWN I HAD TO FILL UP WITH FUEL 
BACK AT THE FIELD JAMES HAD FINALLY JOINED ME AND TOGETHER WE FINISHED THE CULTIVATING 
THEN WE WERE READY TO START PLANTING THE RAPESEED 
BUT SINCE ONE BAG WOULD BE ENOUGH TO DO THE WHOLE TWENTY FIVE ACRES 
ONLY ONE OF US COULD DO IT 
AND ANNOYINGLY JAMES INSISTED IT HAD TO BE HIM 
RIGHT HAVE WE FINISHED NOW EM ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN 
AND TO ADD INSULT TO POVERTY 
WHEN I GOT BACK MY PLOUGHMAN'S WAS SNUBBED 
A CRUSTY FRENCH LOAF M. M. M. TRADITIONAL 
IS WHAT I ASKED FOR THAT'S A FRENCH APPLE AS WELL 
AFTER LUNCH IT WAS TIME FOR THE FINAL JOB 
THE SEEDING MACHINE WAS INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED 
BUT JAMES INSISTED THAT AFTER FOUR HOURS OF PRE SEEDING CHECKS HE WAS UP TO THE JOB 
WE DON'T NEED THAT BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THAT THAT'S GOOD 
JAMES YES DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING YES LISTEN STOP 
STOP PLEASE LISTEN 
BECAUSE SLUGS AND PIGEONS ARE GOING TO EAT HALF ALL THE SEEDS YOU PLANT 
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU PLANT SEVENTY AND THAT'S THAT MANY 
SEVENTY PER SQUARE YARD RIGHT 
THIS IS IT THE MOMENT 
OUR PETROL IS GOING TO BE PLANTED 
HERE WE GO SEED IT 
OH FOR GOD'S SAKE JAMES 
IS THAT IT 
HE'S DONE THE WHOLE BLOODY LOT 
IT'S TWENTY FIVE ACRES HE'S DONE IT IN TWENTY FIVE SQUARE INCHES 
MAY YOU'RE GONNA DIE 
I'M GONNA FEED YOU INTO YOUR OWN MACHINE 
YOU WERE USELESS AT FARMING HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SEASONS 
HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND CHEESE 
AND THEN ALL YOUR SEED FELL ON FALLOW GROUND I KNEW YOU WERE AN ONANIST 
WELL IN FAIRNESS THEY DID MAKE ME GO BACK AND DO ALL THAT AGAIN 
ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT UNTIL MY SEED WAS EVENLY DISTRIBUTED IN EVERY FURROW I COULD FIND 
NEXT YEAR WE'LL HARVEST IT AND MAKE IT INTO DELICIOUS PETROL 
ABSOLUTELY THEN WE'LL BE GREEN AND RICH 
BUT THAT'S IT FOR TONIGHT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WATCHING NEXT WEEK WE MAKE OUR OWN STRETCH LIMOS WHICH DOESN'T GO THAT WELL 
WE'LL SEE YOU THEN GOODNIGHT
