HELLO AND WELCOME TO CASH IN THE ATTIC 
THE SHOW THAT UNEARTHS HIDDEN TREASURE IN YOUR HOME 
AND THEN SELLS IT FOR YOU AT AUCTION 
NOW TODAY I'VE COME TO MILL HILL WHICH IS A SUBURB OF NORTH LONDON 
BUT TO BE MORE PRECISE I'VE COME TO MILL HILL SCHOOL 
DURING ITS ILLUSTRIOUS HISTORY IT'S HAD A NUMBER OF VERY FAMOUS PUPILS AND TEACHERS 
THE FOUNDER OF THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY JAMES MURRAY 
WAS A TEACHER HERE BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY AND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE WHILE HE WORKED ON HIS BOOK 
THE ACTOR PATRICK TROUGHTON FAMOUS AS DOCTOR WHO DURING THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES IS ANOTHER FAMOUS OLD BOY 
INDEED THE SCHOOL'S THEATRE IS NAMED AFTER HIM 
BUT TODAY WE'VE NO MORE TIME TO WAIT AROUND TO HUNT FOR ITEMS 
THAT WILL ATTRACT THE INTEREST OF BIDDERS AT AUCTION 
COMING UP IN CASH IN THE ATTIC A COUPLE WHO SIMPLY CAN'T BELIEVE 
WHAT SOME OF THEIR VALUABLES ARE WORTH 
IT'S SHOCKED ME HAS IT 
AND WE CAN'T BELIEVE IT WHEN WE FIND REAL CASH IN THE ATTIC 
I NEVER GET A CHANCE TO FEEL A BUNDLE OF NOTES LIKE THIS OF ANY SORT 
BUT WHICH COLLECTABLES WILL BRING IN THE MONEY WHEN THEY GO TO AUCTION 
WELL DONE 
ALL WILL BE REVEALED WHEN CLARA AND MALCOLM'S TREASURES GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
TODAY WE'VE COME TO MEET CLARA AND MALCOLM FISHER 
AND THEY'VE CALLED IN THE CASH IN THE ATTIC TEAM 
BECAUSE OF THEIR HUGE DESIRE TO SEE THE WORLD 
CLARA MET MALCOLM TWELVE YEARS AGO WHEN BUILDER MALCOLM ARRIVED TO CONVERT CLARA'S LOFT 
AS THEY SAY LOVE BLOSSOMED UNDER THE EAVES 
OUR JOB IS TO CLEAR OUT THE COLLECTABLES BUT THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY CLUTTER TO CLEAR 
IN THEIR IMMACULATE HOME MAYBE THEY'VE STASHED IT ALL IN THE ATTIC 
I DON'T KNOW TYPICAL OF A MAN LOOKING AT HIS WATCH 
WELL I'M ALWAYS WORKING 
HOW ARE YOU YES YOU LOOK FULL OF THE JOYS 
YES I AM IT'S VERY EXCITING TO BE HERE 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING THE FAMILY 
I'LL TELL YOU LATER ABOUT WHAT'S IN AND WHAT'S OUT 
O. K. ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO FISHING AROUND 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND LET'S GO ALL RIGHT 
CLARA IT IS SO NICE TO CATCH UP WITH YOU HOW ARE YOU NICE TO SEE YOU 
NOW CLARA WHO IS THIS SLIM YOUNG GENTLEMAN BESIDE YOU 
THIS IS MAC MY OLD MAN 
AH SO YOU CALL HIM MAC NOT MALCOLM YES I CALL HIM MAC 
NOW YOU VERY KINDLY CALLED IN THE CASH IN THE ATTIC TEAM AND WE'RE DELIGHTED TO BE HERE 
BUT WHY DID YOU CALL US IN 
TO SEE A BIT OF THE WORLD BECAUSE BASICALLY I'VE BEEN A BIT OF A WORKAHOLIC 
AND NOW IT'S A CHANCE TO GET OUT AND SEE SOME OF THE WORLD 
SO WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SPEND THE MONEY MEXICO PANAMA 
SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRIES WOULD BE REALLY NICE 
NOW HOW MUCH ARE YOU BOTH HOPING TO RAISE EIGHT HUNDRED WOULD BE VERY HANDY 
IF WE'RE GOING TO RAISE AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED WE'D BETTER HAVE A LOOK AT SOME OF YOUR LOVELY TREASURES 
MALCOLM I'M GOING TO FOLLOW YOU WILL YOU LEAD THE WAY I WILL INDEED 
I REALLY WANT MALCOLM AND CLARA TO GET AWAY ON THEIR CRUISE OF A LIFETIME 
AND HOPE WE CAN FIND ENOUGH COLLECTABLES IN THE HOUSE TO SEND THEM ON THEIR WAY 
PAUL HAS ALREADY BEEN WAYLAID BY SOMETHING THAT HAS SET HIS HEART A FLUTTER 
PAUL YOU'RE LOOKING VERY STUDIOUS WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND I'VE GOT MY ARTIST HEAD ON TODAY 
I'VE FOUND SOME LOVELY WATERCOLOURS ACTUALLY 
GORGEOUS YES THEY ARE BUT THESE DON'T LOOK TO BE THAT OLD IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE BOUGHT 
I MET THE ARTIST AND SAW SOME OTHER EXAMPLES OF HIS WORK 
AND I ACTUALLY COMMISSIONED HIM TO DO ME SOME PICTURES OF BIRDS 
WELL THE BEAUTY ABOUT MOST MODERN ARTISTS NOW IS THAT THEY DO SIGN THEIR WORK 
I MEAN WHEN YOU GO BACK TO THE VICTORIAN TIMES AND BEFORE 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT SOMETIMES TO HAVE AN ARTIST'S NAME SO IT'S FANTASTIC 
THEY'VE GOT L. RICHARDSON HERE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE DETAIL WHAT THE ARTIST WOULD DO 
WOULD BE TO GO OUT HE WOULD SEE THIS PARTICULAR BIRD 
HE WOULD TAKE A QUICK SKETCH OF IT AND THEN OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS 
HE WOULD GRADUALLY BUILD UP THE PICTURE AND IT'S VERY HARD TO WORK IN 
UNLIKE OIL IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE YOU CAN'T GO BACK AND RECTIFY IT 
WITH WATERCOLOUR IT HAS TO BE BANG ON AND THE DETAIL THERE IS WONDERFUL 
WELL I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I COULDN'T PAINT TO THAT STANDARD SO AMATEUR OR NOT 
HE'S VERY GOOD INDEED AND THAT'S REFLECTED REALLY 
IN THE VALUE YOU'VE GOT SOME QUITE NICE PIECES HERE SO HOW DO YOU ASSESS THE VALUE 
I THINK YOU'RE LOOKING IF I WAS BEING CONSERVATIVE HERE I WOULD SAY AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE THIRTY EACH 
SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THOSE WITH AN AUCTION ESTIMATE 
OF EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ON THOSE BUT LET'S HOPE THEY FLY AT AUCTION 
OH WE LIKE THAT ONE 
WELL AT THE MENTION OF THE WORD AUCTION IF WE'RE GOING TO RAISE THAT MONEY 
WE'D BETTER GO RUMMAGING AND LOOK FOR MORE WONDERFUL THINGS LIKE THIS 
O. K. SHALL WE GO TO ANOTHER ROOM 
IT'S A GREAT START BUT WE NEED TO GO THROUGH 
EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY IN THIS HOUSE TO FIND MORE ITEMS TO SELL 
HIDDEN AWAY IN A TIN BOX UNDER CLARA'S BED WE FIND A GENUINE TREASURE CHEST STASHED WITH CASH 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE HEARD OF DOSH UNDER THE MATTRESS BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS 
WHAT KIND OF NOTES HAVE YOU GOT THERE 
THESE ARE JAPANESE MILITARY YEN 
AND THESE WERE ISSUED BY THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT TO PAY JAPANESE SOLDIERS THIS IS THEIR SALARY 
BUT WHEN THEY OCCUPIED HONG KONG THIS BECAME THE NATIONAL CURRENCY 
SO IT WAS ONLY REALLY FOR A FEW YEARS 
AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR IT BECAME WORTHLESS PRETTY MUCH OVERNIGHT 
SO IT IS THE SORT OF THING YOU WOULD KEEP AS A SOUVENIR OF THAT TIME CAN I JUST FEEL A BUNDLE 
OF COURSE YOU CAN YES I NEVER GET A CHANCE TO FEEL A BUNDLE OF NOTES LIKE THIS OF ANY SORT 
WOULD THESE BE A COLLECTOR'S ITEM NOW 
I THINK SO THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE WHO COLLECT THEM ANYBODY INTERESTED IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
BUT ALSO ANYBODY INTERESTED IN BANK NOTES 
PEOPLE PAY LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR UNUSUAL BRITISH FIVE NOTES 
OR UNUSUAL AREAS OF COLLECTION OR ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE BRITISH EMPIRE 
THAT'S A BIG MARKET BUT THIS ONE'S DIFFERENT 
SO THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN CURRENCY THAT'S HELD AWAY 
HOW MANY CACHES LIKE THIS ARE AROUND IS DEBATABLE IT'S QUITE AN UNUSUAL FIND 
HAVE YOU KEPT THIS BOX LITERALLY UNDER THE BED 
NO ACTUALLY THEY CAME FROM MY MUM AND SHE THOUGHT THEY WERE WORTHLESS 
SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEM SO SHE SAID YOU CAN KEEP THEM THE BIG QUESTION IS 
HOW MUCH DO YOU RECKON ALL THESE NOTES ARE GOING TO BE WORTH 
I NEED TO FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW MANY WE'VE GOT FIRST 
AND I THINK YOU COULD BE QUITE SURPRISED I THINK YOU'VE GOT A GOOD COLLECTOR'S ITEM HERE 
BUT I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT HOW MANY WE'VE GOT FIRST 
SHALL WE LOOK FOR THAT LOVELY HUSBAND OF YOURS AND SEE WHAT ELSE HE MAY HAVE FOUND O. K. 
THE YEN NOTES WERE A SURPRISE BECAUSE I DIDN'T REALISE THEY WERE WORTH SOMETHING 
I THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST WORTHLESS 
FINGERS CROSSED THAT A FEW OF THE BIDDERS HAVE A YEN FOR MONEY FROM THE FAR EAST 
MEANWHILE IF WE'RE GOING TO PULL IN SOME GOOD OLD BRITISH POUNDS WE HAVE TO CRACK ON 
UPSTAIRS I FIND THIS HIGHLY UNUSUAL FIRE SCREEN 
IT SHOWS A POLISHED CROSS SECTION OF A MAPLE TREE AND COULD MAKE US EIGHTY 
NO ONE'S WASTING ANY TIME DOWNSTAIRS 
AND IT ISN'T LONG BEFORE PAUL GETS HIS HANDS ON SOME DELICATE FINDS 
GLORIA AH HERE WE ARE THESE ARE LOVELY AREN'T THEY THEY ARE 
THESE ARE GERMAN PORCELAIN DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM 
NO I DIDN'T ACTUALLY 
GERMANY REALLY WAS THE MARKET LEADER FOR MAKING PORCELAIN AND ESPECIALLY FIGURE MAKING 
THERE'S A WHOLE AREA CALLED THURINGIA 
I'M GLAD YOU SAID THAT PAUL AND NOT US 
IT'S A PARTICULAR REGION WHERE THEY MAKE PORCELAIN THEY HAVE THE CORRECT INGREDIENTS IN THE SOIL 
SO THEY COULD MAKE THIS WONDERFUL SUBSTANCE 
AND ORIGINALLY THEY WERE ACTUALLY COPIES OF SUGAR SCULPTURES 
AND WHAT USED TO HAPPEN THEY USED TO HAVE THEM ON A DINING TABLE 
AND THEY'D HAVE FOUR MAYBE THE FOUR SEASONS AND THEY WOULD BE CARVED FROM SUGAR 
AND THEY WORKED OUT IF THEY MADE THEM FROM PORCELAIN THEY COULD RE USE THEM 
IT'S VERY DELICATE AND VERY FINE AND ETHEREAL ALMOST ISN'T IT 
IT'S CALLED A HARD PASTE PORCELAIN AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THE SECRET FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THE GERMANS 
THEY WERE THE MARKET LEADERS AND YOU GET THESE WONDERFUL DETAILS 
YOU'VE GOT THE NOSE YOU'VE GOT THE ROSY CHEEKS YOU'VE GOT FINGERS 
AND IT'S A PERFECT MEDIUM TO DO THAT 
THIS IS A FIRM CALLED HERTWIG WHICH IS NOT ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS FACTORIES 
SO THERE ISN'T REALLY THE COLLECTORS FOR THIS ONE 
BUT THIS ONE IS A FIRM CALLED GOEBEL AND HAVE YOU HEARD OF GOEBEL I HAVEN'T NO 
GOEBEL MADE THESE FIGURES FROM THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AND THEY'VE BECOME A MASSIVE SELLER 
AND THEY'RE STILL IN PRODUCTION TODAY 
I COULD SEE THOSE AT LEAST FORTY TO EIGHTY DOES THAT SOUND ALL RIGHT 
IT'S SHOCKED ME HAS IT I THINK MALCOLM DOESN'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT THEM 
YOU'D BE GLAD TO GET RID OF THEM I THINK 
SO NO LOVE LOST THERE AND A USEFUL FORTY TOWARDS OUR EIGHT HUNDRED TARGET 
AS THE REST RUMMAGE I'M TAKING A BREAK TO SAY HELLO TO THE CARP 
IN THE FISHERS' POND AND GET TO THE BOTTOM OF HOW CLARA CAME TO BE IN NORTH LONDON 
WELL CLARA YOUR GARDEN YOUR TYPICALLY ENGLISH GARDEN WITH A LOVELY SORT OF STREAM OF WATER 
IS GORGEOUS BUT A FAR CRY FROM HONG KONG WHERE YOU WERE BORN 
TELL ME A BIT ABOUT GROWING UP THERE 
VERY HECTIC VERY BUSY VERY HOT LOTS AND LOTS OF PEOPLE 
I CAME OVER HERE ACTUALLY TO VISIT MY FATHER WHEN I WAS TWENTY AND I REMEMBER THE FIRST IMPRESSION 
OH IT'S SO GREEN IT WAS SO GREEN SO QUIET AND I JUST LOVE IT 
AND HAVE YOU BEEN BACK SINCE 
NO NEVER YES THAT SHOWS YOU I DON'T MISS IT 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN MARRIED NOW WE'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR THIRTEEN YEARS 
I MEAN I KNOW THAT MAC HAS HAD A HEART CONDITION STILL DOES 
IS THAT ALL THE MORE REASON WHY YOU WANT TO GO TRAVELLING 
YES MY PRIORITY NOW IS LIVE FOR TODAY 
WHATEVER HE WANTS TO DO HE CAN DO IT 
I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF HUNTING AND RUMMAGING 
AND WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT LOTS MORE OF YOUR BEAUTIFUL THINGS SO I THINK WE'D BETTER GO INSIDE 
AND SEE WHAT OTHER TREASURES YOU HAVE ALL RIGHT 
I LOVE CLARA'S ATTITUDE OF WANTING TO SEIZE THE DAY 
AND IT'S MADE ME MORE DETERMINED TO HELP HER AND MALCOLM CRUISE OFF INTO THE SUNSET 
SO ONWARDS AND UPWARDS 
THE FISH THEME CONTINUES WITH THIS LOVELY PAIR OF CHINESE SILVER CEREMONIAL GOBLETS 
WITH FISH SHAPED HANDLES 
PAUL VALUES THEM AT AROUND EIGHTY 
WHILE I CONTINUE SEARCHING DOWNSTAIRS 
PAUL JOINS CLARA IN THE BEDROOM 
SHE WANTS HIS OPINION ON SOMETHING SHE'S FOUND AT THE BACK OF HER WARDROBE 
SO WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE THEN 
THIS IS A KIMONO GIVEN TO ME BY A JAPANESE FRIEND WHEN MY SON WAS BORN 
OH WOW THAT'S JUST A PRESENT 
HOW LONG AGO WAS THAT 
HE'S THIRTY TWO SO THIRTY TWO YEARS AGO 
WHAT AMAZES ME ABOUT THIS 
IT'S A TRADITION THAT'S GONE ON PROBABLY OVER ONE THOUSAND YEARS 
THEY HAD THE SECRET OF MAKING REAL SILK FOR A LONG TIME 
AND THE SILK IS THEN USED WITH A WATERCOLOUR BASE 
AND YOU END UP WITH THESE WONDERFUL ITEMS 
IT WAS EVERYBODY'S DRESS AT A CERTAIN TIME BUT THESE REALLY ARE KEPT FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS 
OR A PARTICULAR CEREMONY THAT TYPE OF THING BUT THIS IS WONDERFUL 
DOES IT HAVE ANY SENTIMENTAL VALUE FOR YOU 
NO BECAUSE MY SON HAS NEVER WORN IT 
YOU'VE GOT A LABEL HERE THIS IS QUITE A FAMOUS DEPARTMENT STORE IN JAPAN 
MITSUKOSHI AND THEY BELIEVE IT OR NOT INTRODUCED THE WESTERN WAY OF SELLING THINGS 
WHERE AN ITEM WOULD BE PRICED WITHOUT BARTERING 
BEFORE THEN IN JAPAN EVERYTHING WAS BARTERING SO THEY INTRODUCED THAT 
AND THEY'VE BECOME WORLD FAMOUS LIKE THE HARRODS OF JAPAN 
DOES IT HAVE ANY ELABORATE BACK ON IT OR ANYTHING PARTICULARLY NICE LOOK AT THAT WOW THAT'S AN EAGLE 
I MEAN IN THE WEST THE EAGLE'S VERY MUCH A POWER SYMBOL SO THAT'S POSSIBLY WHAT IT IS 
BUT I DON'T NEED TO ASK YOU WHAT THAT IS THAT'S MOUNT FUJI YES THAT'S RIGHT 
THAT'S LIKE PUTTING BIG BEN ON SOMETHING HERE IT'S VERY JAPANESE 
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY LOOK FOR IF YOU GET ANCIENT KIMONOS I HAVE HAD ONE OR TWO FROM THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
AND THEY'RE EXTREMELY VALUABLE BUT TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S QUITE MODERN 
THIRTY YEARS OLD IT HASN'T THE ANTIQUE VALUE YET BUT AS A VISUAL PIECE 
I SHOULD IMAGINE YOU'RE APPROACHING THE ONE HUNDRED MARK I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT 
WITH AN ESTIMATE OF FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED AND SEE HOW IT GOES THAT'S GOOD 
SOUND ALL RIGHT THAT'S GOOD 
WELL IT'S CLEAR THAT PAUL REALLY APPRECIATES THE INTRICATE DESIGN 
AND QUALITY OF THIS KIMONO LET'S HOPE IT DOES WELL 
AS OUR HUNT CONTINUES OUR RUMMAGING TEAM LEAVES NO STONE UNTURNED 
FROM THE BACK OF A DRAWER CLARA PULLS OUT A SET OF FOUR KITCHEN WEIGHTS 
WHICH COULD FETCH TOP BRASS OF THIRTY FIVE 
AS THE DAY DRAWS TO A CLOSE PAUL'S FINAL FIND 
BRINGS CLARA AND MALCOLM'S DREAM OF A CRUISE EVEN CLOSER 
I THOUGHT I'D DRAG YOU IN HERE BECAUSE THESE ARE SOME OF MY FAVOURITE ITEMS 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE 
I KNOW THEY'RE CLARET JUGS 
EXACTLY BUT HAVE YOU EVER USED THEM NO NEVER 
THEN WHAT YOU'VE GOT HERE IS BASICALLY A CUT GLASS DECANTER SO THIS IS REAL CUT LEAD CRYSTAL 
AND THEN IT'S BEEN MOUNTED WITH THIS SILVER HANDLE 
AND THAT MAKES IT INTO A CLARET JUG AND WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE WERE DINING 
WINE USED TO ACTUALLY BE STORED IN CASKS IN THE CELLAR 
AND IT WAS THE BUTLER'S JOB TO DECANT IT INTO A DECANTER FROM THE CASKS 
NOWADAYS WE HAVE THE BOTTLE STRAIGHT ON THE TABLE 
SO THE MORE ELABORATE YOUR SERVING VESSEL WAS 
THE MORE WEALTHIER THE PERSON TENDS TO BE SO IT'S A VERY TRADITIONAL ITEM BUT THE QUALITY IS SUPERB 
YOU'VE GOT THIS CUT GLASS BASE WHICH IS CUT BY HAND 
THE SILVER MOUNTS DON'T MATCH BUT THEY ARE SUPER QUALITY 
I ACTUALLY THINK THIS ONE'S MADE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND I THINK WHAT HAPPENED AT THE TIME WITH THE JUBILEE 
WE WERE CELEBRATING EVERYTHING BRITISH AND CAN YOU READ THOSE ON THE TOP 
HAVE YOU WORKED OUT WHAT THESE SYMBOLISE 
I THINK IT WAS A SHAMROCK AND A THISTLE SO IT'S IRELAND AND SCOTLAND YEP 
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT A ROSE A ROSE YES SO THAT'S 
ENGLISH ROSE YES AND THERE'S ONE MORE THERE WHICH IS A DAFFODIL A DAFFODIL YES WHERE'S THAT 
GOT TO BE WELSH WALES THERE YOU ARE 
BUT I THINK THOSE ARE VERY COLLECTABLE ITEMS 
AND THEN ADDING TO THAT THEN THIS ONE'S A LIMITED EDITION 
THERE'S ONLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OF THESE AND THIS ONE IS NUMBER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX 
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY EXQUISITE 
HOW MUCH DO YOU RECKON THEY'LL GET AT AUCTION 
WELL I'D LIKE TO SEE THESE WITH AN ESTIMATE TO GIVE THEM A BIT OF A CHANCE AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY CAN'T BE BAD 
I CAN SEE THEM MAKING MORE THAN THAT 
BUT IF WE SAID THAT AT LEAST TO START WITH HOW DOES THAT SOUND 
GREAT ARE YOU PLEASED WITH THAT 
WELL DO YOU KNOW THAT IS REALLY GOOD NEWS BECAUSE WHEN I ADD THAT 
TO THE OTHER ASSESSMENT THAT PAUL HAS GIVEN 
THE JAPANESE YEN DATING BACK TO WORLD WAR TWO 
BUT WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE AUCTION TO SEE HOW MUCH THEY'RE WORTH IN TODAY'S MONEY 
NEXT ON CASH IN THE ATTIC 
AS WE HIT THE SALE ROOM WHAT WILL BRING THE SURPRISES 
HEY BRILLIANT THAT'S BRILLIANT 
YOU'RE IN SHOCK YES 
AND WHAT WILL BRING THE DISAPPOINTMENTS COME ON THERE WE GO 
IT'S ALL TO COME WHEN OUR COLLECTABLES GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
AND SO IT'S BEEN SEVERAL WEEKS SINCE WE HELPED MALCOLM AND CLARA FISHER SEARCH THEIR HOME IN NORTH LONDON 
FOR ANTIQUES AND COLLECTABLES TO SELL HERE AT THE HAMPSHIRE AUCTION ROOMS IN ANDOVER 
NOW THEY WANT TO RAISE AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED TO PUT TOWARDS A WORLD CRUISE 
SO LET'S HOPE THAT THEY SAIL THROUGH THE AUCTION WHEN THEIR ITEMS GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
THIS POPULAR SALE ROOM ATTRACTS EXPERT DEALERS AND AMATEUR ENTHUSIASTS ALIKE 
THEY'RE ALL HERE IN FORCE TODAY CASTING THEIR EYES OVER THE ITEMS TO BE SOLD 
AMONGST THEM OF COURSE IS PAUL WHO LOOKS LIKE HE'S JUST PICKED UP A WIN ON THE HORSES 
HELLO YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY BEEN OUT SINGING AGAIN HAVEN'T YOU A FISTFUL OF MONEY 
I DID VERY WELL ACTUALLY WHAT A NIGHTCLUB THAT WAS LOOK AT THAT 
I RECOGNISE THESE THESE CAME FROM MALCOLM AND CLARA'S HOUSE 
THEY'RE NOT ALL HERE ACTUALLY 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT THERE WERE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND OF THEM IN THAT BOX 
BUT WE DECIDED TO SELL THREE THOUSAND OF THEM TO SORT OF TEST THE WATER REALLY 
AT THE HOUSE YOU SAID THAT THIS IS NOT YOUR FIELD 
SO YOU WEREN'T SURE WHAT THEY MIGHT FETCH DO YOU HAVE ANY CLEARER IDEA 
I'VE RUNG THE CORRECT PEOPLE WHO HAVE INFORMED ME A COUPLE OF THINGS 
BUT I NEED TO GET CONFIRMATION SO I'LL TELL YOU LATER YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL ME NOW 
NOT JUST YET NO 
WELL IT'S MALCOLM AND CLARA'S FIRST AUCTION 
I'M SURE THEY'RE HERE SO WHY DON'T WE GO AND SAY HELLO

PROBABLY BE ME WELL YOU KNOW I THINK THE AUCTION IS ABOUT TO START SO CATALOGUE AT THE READY 
I HAVE YES WELL IT'S ABOUT TO BEGIN I'M EXCITED MYSELF O. K. LET'S GO 
AS YOU CAN SENSE THERE'S A REAL AIR OF ANTICIPATION ABOUT THE PLACE 
AS THE AUCTION BEGINS AND WE FIND AN IDEAL SPOT 
NOW REMEMBER IF YOU GO TO AUCTION YOU HAVE TO BUDGET FOR THE COMMISSION FEE 
VAT AND OTHER POTENTIAL CHARGES BUT OF COURSE DETAILS WILL BE AVAILABLE FROM YOUR LOCAL AUCTION HOUSE 
WE'RE ALL HOPING OUR FIRST LOT OF THE DAY WILL APPEAL TO SOME TWITCHERS IN THE ROOM 
LOT TWENTY EIGHT YOU'VE GOT THE FOUR WATERCOLOURS OF THE BIRDS 
NOW I MUST ADMIT THESE PAINTINGS ARE BEAUTIFUL BUT THEY ARE MODERN 
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF MODERN ARTISTS PARTICULARLY WORKING WITH BIRDS 
SO I DON'T THINK WE'VE GOT THE ANTIQUE OR COLLECTABLE VALUE BUT THEY ARE PLEASING 
EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY WE'RE LOOKING FOR 
UM WELL I'VE GOT 
I'VE GOT FIFTY ONLY HERE FIVE IS THERE 
FIFTY FIVE ANYWHERE FIFTY FIVE THERE IS SIXTY 
FIVE SEVENTY AT SEVENTY POINT FIVE ANYWHERE 
SEVENTY TWO IF YOU LIKE SEVENTY TWO THERE IS SEVENTY FIVE SEVENTY EIGHT NO SEVENTY FIVE POINT SEVEN EIGHT ANYWHERE

THERE WE ARE JUST UNDER 
A GOOD START AND RELIEF ALL ROUND FOR OUR WATERCOLOURS 
WHICH CAME IN JUST FIVE UNDER ESTIMATE 
NEXT TO GO UNDER THE HAMMER IS OUR UNUSUAL FIRE SCREEN 
WITH THAT POLISHED CROSS SECTION OF A MAPLE TREE 
WE REALLY NEED TO FIND THE RIGHT BUYERS TO GET THE RIGHT BID 
AT EIGHTY 
NO HE DIDN'T SELL IT THEN 
WE PUT A RESERVE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY BECAUSE YOU WERE QUITE ATTACHED 
AND THESE ARE HIGHLY PRIZED OUT IN JAPAN 
AND FETCH A LOT MORE MONEY 
SO IT'S HEADING BACK HOME WITH CLARA 
MAYBE SHE'LL FIND A SPECIALIST COLLECTOR ANOTHER DAY 
THAT TARGET OF EIGHT HUNDRED IS STILL A LONG WAY OFF 
SO LET'S HOPE THERE ARE SOME HEAVYWEIGHT DEALERS IN THE ROOM WAITING FOR OUR NEXT ITEM 
LOT FIFTY EIGHT THEN YOU'VE GOT THE FOUR BRASS WEIGHTS PROBABLY FROM A BANK 
PAUL I SAW THE FOUR BRASS WEIGHTS IN THE CUPBOARD EARLIER ON 
WHAT'S YOUR EXPECTATION FOR THESE I PUT THESE IN AT TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE

THIRTY FOR THESE 
TWENTY IF YOU LIKE THEN TWENTY THERE IS TWO ANYWHERE

TWENTY FOUR AT TWENTY FOUR TWENTY SIX ANYWHERE IT MIGHT CREEP UP A BIT 
SELLING AT TWENTY FOUR

NOW WE'RE REALLY BANKING ON OUR NEXT LOT DOING WELL 
THAT ELEGANT PAIR OF SILVER CLARET DECANTERS FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN COMMEMORATING THE QUEEN'S SILVER JUBILEE 
WHETHER OR NOT THEY SELL COULD MAKE OR BREAK THE FISHERS' DREAM OF A CRUISE 
WELL IT'S REALLY HOTTING UP BECAUSE THESE DECANTERS ARE JUST ABOUT TO GO UNDER THE HAMMER

I THINK CLARA AND MALCOLM CAN NOW BEGIN TO IMAGINE THEMSELVES 
ON BOARD THAT LINER 
WE'RE OVER HALFWAY THROUGH AND I'M INTRIGUED BY OUR NEXT ITEM 
IT'S SO UNUSUAL AND PAUL'S BEEN VERY SECRETIVE ABOUT ITS VALUE 
THE COLLECTION OF THE JAPANESE BANK NOTES NOW FROM THE OCCUPATION JUST AFTER THE WAR 
ARE YOU GOING TO REVEAL WHAT YOUR ESTIMATE IS YES 
WE ESTIMATE THESE AT BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED 
YOU'VE KEPT A LOT OF THEM AT HOME HAVEN'T YOU YES

I PUT A RESERVE OF TWO HUNDRED ON THOSE BECAUSE YOU WERE SO ATTACHED TO THEM OH RIGHT 
SO THEY'RE GOING BACK WITH YOU TO THE COLLECTION I'M AFRAID OH O. K. 
GOING BACK WITH THAT WOODEN FIRE SCREEN 
WELL I THINK BRINGING ALONG JUST A LITTLE OF THIS WAD OF YEN 
AND PUTTING A RESERVE ON IT WAS A GOOD WAY FOR US TO TEST THE MARKET 
CLARA MAY DECIDE TO SELL IT TO A SPECIALIST DEALER IN THE FUTURE 
IN THE MEANTIME IT'S BACK IN THAT TIN BOX UNDER THE BED 
OUR NEXT ITEM CONTINUES THE EASTERN THEME 
LOT TWO TWENTY A YOU'VE GOT THE KIMONO HANGING DOWN BY THE OFFICE

JUST A FEW WEEKS LATER CLARA AND MALCOLM CELEBRATE THEIR SUCCESS 
BY BOARDING THE GOOD SHIP ORIANA AT SOUTHAMPTON DOCKS 
MALCOLM'S ILL HEALTH HAS PREVENTED THEM FROM CRUISING AS FAR AS CENTRAL AMERICA 
BUT THEY'RE STILL DETERMINED TO MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR TRIP 
WE DECIDED TO TAKE THE MONEY FROM THE AUCTION TOGETHER WITH THE MONEY WE SAVED FOR MEXICO 
AND TO TAKE THE CRUISE NOW AND LIVE FOR TODAY SO HERE WE ARE 
THEIR VOYAGE AROUND THE MEDITERRANEAN WILL TAKE THEM 
TO ITALY SPAIN AND TUNISIA AND I'M CERTAIN IT'LL BE THE HOLIDAY OF A LIFETIME
