THROUGHOUT HISTORY TO EXPLORE SPACE WAS AN IMPOSSIBLE FANTASY 
THEN TWO RIVAL SCIENTISTS BECAME LOCKED IN A RACE TO ACHIEVE THAT DREAM 
THEIR STRUGGLE WOULD MAKE HISTORY 
SERGEI KOROLEV 
WE CAN LAUNCH A MAN MADE MOON A SATELLITE INTO ORBIT AROUND THE EARTH 
RELEASED FROM THE GULAG TO TAKE THE SOVIET UNION INTO SPACE 
HIS RIVAL WERNHER VON BRAUN 
SPACE PIONEER VISIONARY HAUNTED BY HIS NAZI PAST 
WE COULD HAVE MADE SPACE HISTORY TODAY FOR AMERICA 
WE COULD HAVE LAUNCHED THE WORLD'S FIRST SATELLITE 
THIS IS THE FUTURE ONE AM QUITE SURE OF IT 
IT REQUIRES AN OPEN MIND PERHAPS YOU'VE NOT GOT ONE 
IT'S JUST BEEN ANNOUNCED OVER THE RADIO THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE PUT A SATELLITE INTO SPACE 
THE LAUNCH OF THE SPUTNIK HAS REVEALED THAT THE SOVIETS MAY ALREADY BE FIVE YEARS AHEAD OF US 
I GUESS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ALARMED THAT A FOREIGN ENEMY COUNTRY CAN DO THIS 
VON BRAUN TRIED TO CATCH UP 
DO WE HAVE A SATELLITE OR DON'T WE 
GENTLEMEN WE'VE MADE IT TO SPACE YEAH HEY HEY HEY HEY 
TODAY WE HAVE ANSWERED THE SOVIET CHALLENGE AND IN DOING SO OPENED THE GATES TO THE HEAVENS 
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT WE ARE IN A RACE TO SPACE 
A RACE THAT WE INTEND TO WIN 
NOW KOROLEV PLANS HIS NEXT SPECTACULAR MOVE 
THE FIRST MAN INTO SPACE 
THE CANDIDATE SHOULD BE AROUND THIRTY 
HEIGHT BELOW ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY CENTIMETRES 
WEIGHT LESS THAN SEVENTY KILOS 
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL 
HE MUST BE A MAN WITH A BROAD SMILE 
THE HUNT FOR A SPACEMAN IS ON 
ACROSS THE SOVIET UNION MILITARY EXPERTS SEARCH FOR COSMONAUTS TO MATCH KOROLEV'S SPECIFICATION 
THE MISSION IS SO SECRET THAT EVEN THOSE CHOSEN HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT'S FOR OR WHO'S BEHIND IT 
THE SELECTED CANDIDATES ARE PUT UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONS TO TEST THEIR PHYSICAL STRENGTH 
SUBJECTED TO HIGH TEMPERATURES AND PRESSURES SOME ARE TAKEN ALMOST TO THE POINT OF DEATH 
GHERMAN STEPANOVICH TITOV 
VALENTINE STEPANOVICH VON 
A FINAL SIX ARE CHOSEN 
EACH HOPES TO BE THE FIRST MAN INTO SPACE 
ANGRIAN GRIGOROVICH NIKOLAI 
YURI ALEXEEVICH GAGARIN 
COMRADES 
WE HAVE OUR COSMONAUTS 
KOROLEV IS WELL AHEAD OF THE AMERICANS 
HIS R. SEVEN ROCKET POWERFUL ENOUGH TO CROSS CONTINENTS AND WIPE OUT 
ENTIRE AMERICAN CITIES WILL EASILY LAUNCH HIS COSMONAUTS INTO SPACE 
WITH THE SPACE RACE FAST BECOMING A NEW BATTLEGROUND OF THE COLD WAR 
EACH SIDE IS PREPARING TO FIGHT TO THE LAST 
THE NEW YORK TIMES CALLS IT A RACE FOR SURVIVAL 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
TO CONFRONT THE SOVIET THREAT THE NEWLY CREATED NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION NASA 
HAS HASTILY PUT TOGETHER A PROJECT TO GET AN AMERICAN INTO SPACE 
TODAY WE ARE INTRODUCING TO YOU AND TO THE WORLD 
SEVEN MEN WHO HAVE BEEN SELECTED TO BEGIN TRAINING FOR SPACE FLIGHT 
ALL FAMILY MEN THEY ARE HERE AFTER A LONG 
SEVEN TEST PILOTS ARE THROWN TO THE WORLD'S MEDIA 
PLEASE WELCOME OUR NATION'S PROJECT MERCURY ASTRONAUTS 
PERHAPS WE COULD START PROCEEDINGS WITH A FEW QUESTIONS 
YES SIR CAN I ASK THE ASTRONAUTS DO THEIR WIVES AND KIDS HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THIS 
COMMANDER SHEPARD 
I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS AT HOME MY FAMILY IS IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT 
FROM A NATION OF ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION THEY STEPPED FORWARD LAST WEEK 
SEVEN MEN CUT OF THE SAME STONE OF STONE AS COLUMBUS AND MAGELLAN 
BUT THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE 
RARELY WERE HISTORY'S EXPLORERS AND DISCOVERERS SO CLEARLY MARKED IN ADVANCE AS MEN OF DESTINY 
THE RUSSIANS ARE TRYING TO GET THERE BUT I THINK WE'RE GONNA GET THERE FIRST 
ONE WILL BE CHOSEN TO TEST FOR THE FIRST TIME WHETHER A HUMAN 
CAN BE SHOT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILES INTO SPACE AT SPEEDS OF EIGHTEEN THOUSAND MILES AN HOUR 
EXPERIENCE TEMPERATURES ALMOST AS HOT AS THE SURFACE OF THE SUN ON RE ENTRY AND LIVE TO TELL ABOUT IT 
AND ONE FINAL QUESTION 
YES SIR 
COULD I ASK FOR A SHOW OF HANDS HOW MANY OF YOU ARE CONFIDENT 
THAT YOU'LL COME BACK ALIVE FROM OUTER SPACE 
TEN NINE EIGHT SEVEN SIX 
THE MERCURY SEVEN ARE TO SEE THE LAUNCH OF THE ROCKET THAT NASA HOPES WILL TAKE THEM INTO SPACE 
THE ATLAS IS STILL UNDERGOING TRIALS TO BECOME AMERICA'S FIRST INTERCONTINENTAL MISSILE LIFT OFF 
WELL GLAD THEY GOT THAT ONE OUT OF THE WAY 
WITH THE FAILURE OF THE ATLAS NASA TURNED TO THEIR ONLY OPTION LEFT 
AN OLD U. S. ARMY MISSILE CALLED REDSTONE 
MACH OH SEVEN FIVE RISING 
IN A HIGH SPEED WIND TUNNEL AMERICA'S LEADING ROCKET ENGINEER WERNHER VON BRAUN 
IS TESTING HIS REDSTONE TO FIND OUT WHAT MODIFICATIONS IT NEEDS TO CARRY AN ASTRONAUT 
WITH AMERICAN HOPES RELYING ON HIS ROCKET A JOURNALIST HAS COME TO SEE IF HE HAS THE SOLUTION 
THIS ROCKET IS MORE OR LESS A V. TWO AM I RIGHT 
THE SAME AS YOU BUILT FOR THE GERMANS 
BASED ON THE DESIGN 
THAT WAS SOME TIME AGO 
MACH EIGHTY SEVEN 
CAPSULE VIBRATION NINETY DECIBELS INCREASING 
IT'S STARTING 
AS THE ROCKET SPEEDS TOWARDS THE SOUND BARRIER SHOCK WAVES BUILD UP 
MACH OH NINE THREE CAPSULE VIBRATION ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DECIBELS RISING 
CAUSING IT TO VIBRATE VIOLENTLY 
WOW KILL IT 
WELL THAT CONCLUDES THE ENTERTAINMENT IS THIS KIND OF PROBLEM SERIOUS 
IT WILL BE FIXED AS ONE OF THE MANY MODIFICATIONS TO BE MADE TO MAKE THE ROCKET SAFE FOR MAN FLIGHT PLEASE 
THE VIBRATION IS SO SEVERE IT WOULD HAVE KILLED AN ASTRONAUT 
AND VON BRAUN HAS OTHER PROBLEMS 
REDSTONE REQUIRES EIGHT HUNDRED MODIFICATIONS TO MAKE IT SAFE 
EVEN THEN IT HAS ONLY A TENTH OF THE POWER OF KOROLEV'S ROCKET 
BARELY ENOUGH TO PUT A MAN INTO SPACE 
BUT BEFORE VON BRAUN IMPROVES ANYTHING HIS RIVAL DELIVERS ANOTHER CRUSHING BLOW 
BOTH SIDES HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SEND UNMANNED PROBES TO THE MOON 
KOROLEV SUCCEEDS WHEN LUNA TWO IMPACTS ON ITS SURFACE A MILESTONE IN SPACE EXPLORATION 
AND DELIBERATELY TIMED TO COINCIDE WITH KHRUSHCHEV'S TOUR OF THE U. S. 
THE SOVIET LEADER BOASTS WE HAVE BEATEN YOU TO THE MOON BUT YOU HAVE BEATEN US IN SAUSAGE MAKING 
JUST THREE WEEKS LATER KOROLEV'S NEXT PROBE PHOTOGRAPHS 
THE FAR SIDE OF THE MOON NEVER BEFORE SEEN BY MAN 
DESPITE ALL THESE TRIUMPHS VON BRAUN HAS NO IDEA WHO THE SOVIET'S CHIEF DESIGNER IS 
KOROLEV'S IDENTITY IS A CLOSELY GUARDED STATE SECRET 
EVEN AFTER FIVE MONTHS' TRAINING THE COSMONAUTS HAVE YET TO MEET THE MAN HIMSELF 
I CONSIDER THIS DAY TO BE A REMARKABLE ONE 
LET'S GET ACQUAINTED 
THIS IS MY DEPUTY VASILY MISHIN 
YOUR NAME 
AIR FORCE PILOT GHERMAN TITOV 
AND WHERE ARE YOU FROM 
OUTER REGION COMRADE KOROLEV 
AND YOU YURI ALEXEEVICH GAGARIN SMOLENSK 
SCHOOL VOCATIONAL SCHOOL SMELTER'S PROFESSION 
WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON YURI ALEXEEVICH 
I TOO GRADUATED FROM A VOCATIONAL SCHOOL 
SUBJECT BUILDER 
SPECIALISING IN ROOF TILES 
KOROLEV TAKES THE COSMONAUTS TO SEE THE VOSTOK THE CAPSULE THAT WILL TAKE THEM INTO SPACE 
SO WHERE ARE THE CONTROLS 
HOW DO I FLY THIS 
THE VOSTOK IS COMPLETELY AUTOMATIC 
AND CONTROLLED FROM THE GROUND 
WITHOUT WINGS HOW DOES IT LAND 
WHEN YOU RE ENTER THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE FRICTION WILL SLOW YOU DOWN 
AS IT DOES SO THE FRONT OF THE CAPSULE WILL REACH A TEMPERATURE OF SIX THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND DEGREES 
NEARLY AS HOT AS THE SURFACE OF THE SUN 
WHAT BRINGS THE VOSTOK DOWN FROM ORBIT 
GOOD QUESTION ALEXI 
ALEXI THIS IS ONE FOR YOU COME AND DO YOUR DEMONSTRATION 
COMRADES THIS IS ALEXI MIKHEILOVICH ASEO 
HE DESIGNS THE RETRO ROCKETS WHICH BRING YOU BACK 
THIS IS THE EARTH THIS THE CAPSULE 
FIRST WE MUST SLOW THE SPEED OF THE CAPSULE 
WHICH WILL BE TRAVELLING AT AROUND TWENTY SEVEN ZERO ZERO ZERO K. P. H. 
WITH SMALL BRAKING ROCKETS 
THE ROCKETS MUST FIRE WITH GREAT ACCURACY 
TOO LONG AND THE CAPSULE WILL FALL DOWN TOO RAPIDLY 
TOWARDS THE EARTH AND BURN UP 
TOO SHORT 
AND IT WILL HIT THE OUTER ATMOSPHERE AND BOUNCE OFF 
INTO INTO A HIGHER ORBIT 
HOW WOULD YOU RETURN 
YOU WOULD NOT YOU WOULD FLY AROUND THE EARTH FOREVER 
BUT THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 
YOU WILL SUCCEED 
THANK YOU 
INTELLIGENCE REPORTS SOON FILTER BACK TO AMERICA THAT THE SOVIETS ARE CLOSE TO SENDING A MAN INTO SPACE 
THE PRESSURE INCREASES ON NASA ENGINEERS TO COMPLETE 
THEIR MERCURY SPACE CAPSULE ALREADY A WHOLE YEAR BEHIND SCHEDULE 
NASA'S MERCURY MANNED SPACE PROGRAM SEEMS TO BE PLUMMETING THE U. S. 
TOWARDS A NEW AND HUMILIATING DISASTER IN THE EAST WEST SPACE RACE 
IN CHARGE OF THE MOUNTING CRISIS IS NASA DIRECTOR BOB GILRUTH 
CALLED IN TO SEE YET ANOTHER PROBLEM ON THE PROTOTYPE 
SO WHAT DID YOU HAVE TO SHOW ME 
WE'RE HAVING TO TAKE A HALF INCH OFF THE CAPSULE 
HALF INCH OFF THE CAPSULE WHY 
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FIT THE ROCKET 
OH MY GOD 
MY GOD WERNHER IS GONNA GO MAD 
O. K. HOLD IT GUYS LET'S TAKE SOME MEASUREMENTS 
ONE SPOKESMAN WAS QUOTED THE ONLY WAY IS TO GO FASTER THAN THEY GO 
I DON'T KNOW HOW FAST THAT IS 
I WOULD SAY WE'D BETTER JUST GO LIKE HELL 
HALF AN INCH 
WITH AN ANGLE GRINDER 
SIMPKINSON SAYS THAT IT'S GONNA TAKE A COUPLE MORE DAYS 
DOES WERNHER KNOW 
YEAH 
THIS WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED IF THE CAPSULE HAD COME HERE FIRST 
FUTURE ONES MUST COME TO HUNTSVILLE FOR INTEGRATION TESTS WITH THE REDSTONE BEFORE GOING TO THE CAPE 
WERNHER THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN 
WE STILL HAVE TO FIT DAMPENERS TO ELIMINATE VIBRATION 
WERNHER PLEASE AND WHO IS GOING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY WHEN THE TWO DON'T WORK TOGETHER 
WERNHER LISTEN I'M L. ISTENING 
THE F. B. I. SAY THAT THE SOVIETS MAY BE READY TO GO AS SOON AS NOVEMBER 
WE CAN'T WASTE TIME TRUCKING THIS CAPSULE FROM STATE TO STATE WHILE THE REDS ARE ORBITING THE EARTH 
AND YOU PREFER WE KILL AN ASTRONAUT 
WELL AS WITH EVERYTHING ELSE AT NASA I CAN SEE A COMMITTEE HAS DECIDED 
BUT HOW YOU THINK THAT A CAPSULE MADE AT MCDONOUGH WITH A ROCKET BUILT AT BOEING 
DESIGNED IN HUNTSVILLE OVERSEEN BY BUREAUCRATS IN WASHINGTON IS GOING TO FIT TOGETHER LIKE THIS 
AH WE SHALL SEE 
DID HITLER HAVE THESE PROBLEMS WHEN HE WAS MAKING THE V. TWO 
YOU KNOW THEY'RE MAKING A MOVIE ABOUT HIS LIFE 
H. M. M. I AIM FOR THE STARS 
THE FULL TITLE IS I AIM FOR THE STARS BUT SOMETIMES I HIT LONDON 
WHILE VON BRAUN ONLY HAS TO DEAL WITH NASA 
KOROLEV HAS TO COMPETE WITH RIVAL ROCKET GROUPS FOR HIS FUNDING 
AND DESIGNER VALENTIN GLUSHKO HAS A NEW ROCKET ENGINE THAT COULD BE EXACTLY WHAT MARSHALL NEDELIN 
THE CHIEF OF STRATEGIC MISSILES IS LOOKING FOR 
IT POSES A SERIOUS THREAT TO KOROLEV 
IF THE MILITARY DECIDE TO SWITCH TO GLUSHKO'S DESIGN HE COULD LOSE VITAL FUNDS 
COMRADE MARSHAL COMRADES THE TEST IS ABOUT TO BEGIN 
PLEASE MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE CONTROL ROOM 
THE TWO MEN ALREADY HAVE A TROUBLED RELATIONSHIP 
GLUSHKO BETRAYED KOROLEV TO THE SECRET POLICE 
HE SPENT SIX YEARS IN THE GULAG 
THE MILITARY ADVANTAGE OF A ROCKET WITH GLUSHKO'S ENGINE IS THAT IT CAN BE FIRED QUICKLY 
BUT IT USES A NEW VOLATILE FUEL 
THE FUMES ALONE WILL DISSOLVE A MAN'S LUNGS 
YOU'RE NOT CONVINCED SERGEI PAVLOVICH OF THIS FUEL NO 
IT IS THE DEVIL'S VENOM FAR TOO TOXIC AND CORROSIVE 
FOR A SPACEMAN MAYBE 
BUT NOT A NUCLEAR WARHEAD 
YOU KNOW SERGEI PAVLOVICH IMAGINE IF OUR BULLETS WORKED LIKE YOUR ROCKETS 
WELL WE NEED A ROCKET THAT FIRES WHEN WE PULL THE TRIGGER 
COMRADES PLEASE STAND BY 
START THE RECORDERS 
TURBO PUMPS ON 
VALVES OPEN 
IGNITION 
THE TEST IS A SUCCESS 
AND THE THRUST IS EVEN BETTER THAN I EXPECTED 
I HAVE PROVEN THESE ENGINES TO BE MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE RELIABLE 
RELIABLE LIKE A STICK OF DYNAMITE 
ALL ROCKETS ARE STICKS OF DYNAMITE 
I WILL NOT ASK A MAN TO GET INTO SOMETHING THAT IS MORE LIKELY TO GAS HIM THAN TO GET HIM INTO SPACE 
WE'LL SEE BUT DON'T EXPECT THE MILITARY TO KEEP PAYING OUT FOR YOUR SPACE FANTASIES 
KOROLEV ORDERS A LAUNCH OF THE R. SEVEN 
HE NEEDS ANOTHER PROPAGANDA COUP TO PROVE THAT IN THE COLD WAR 
HIS SPACE PROJECTS WORK AS WELL AS MILITARY MISSILES 
HE PLANS A HISTORIC MISSION THE FIRST TO BRING BACK LIVING CREATURES FROM SPACE 
LISICHKA AND CHAIKA WILL TEST THE SAME VOSTOK CAPSULE THAT WILL BE USED FOR A COSMONAUT 
ACHIEVING A RETURN TRIP IS A VITAL STEP TOWARDS MANNED SPACE FLIGHT 
OXYGEN PRESSURISATION COMPLETE 
OXYGEN PRESSURISATION COMPLETE 
ALMOST WELL EITHER IT IS OR IT ISN'T WHICH IS IT 
COMPLETE CHIEF 
WHY CAN'T I SEE THE T. V. PICTURES YET THEY'RE COMING 
LET'S HOPE THEY RETURN SERGEI 
I CAN'T STAND ANY MORE COMPLAINTS FROM THESE ENGLISH ANIMAL LOVERS 
ALL RIGHT LET'S GO 
THE PROGRESS REPORTS ARE GIVEN IN NUMBERS 
BELOW FIVE AND THE ROCKET IS IN TROUBLE 
TWENTY EIGHT SECONDS INTO FLIGHT THE BOOSTER ROCKET EXPLODES 
LISICHKA AND CHAIKA ARE INCINERATED 
AFTER THIS IT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE SIN TO RISK THE LIFE OF A YOUNG PILOT 
PERHAPS ONE OF US A SCIENTIST OR A DESIGNER SHOULD GO FIRST 
UTTER NONSENSE SENTIMENTAL RUBBISH 
WE GO AHEAD I WANT ANOTHER DOG LAUNCH WITHIN A MONTH A MONTH 
AND THEN WE LAUNCH A COSMONAUT 
LESS THAN A MONTH LATER THE R. SEVEN FLIES AGAIN WITH ANOTHER PAIR OF DOGS 
THIS TIME THE ROCKET PERFORMS WELL AND BELKA AND STRELKA ARE SOON IN ORBIT 
THEY'RE JUST PASSING THE AMERICAN EXPLORER SATELLITE 
GOOD SOVIET DOGS 
MAYBE THEY COULD PISS ON IT 
THE SOVIET UNION IS QUICK TO ANNOUNCE THE SUCCESS OF BELKA AND STRELKA 
KOROLEV DELIVERS HIS PROPAGANDA VICTORY 
AND MORE THAN THAT HE DEMONSTRATES TO THE WORLD THAT HIS SPACECRAFT 
IS CAPABLE OF BRINGING A COSMONAUT BACK TO EARTH ALIVE 
IN A GOODWILL GESTURE PREMIER KHRUSHCHEV HAS SENT 
ONE OF DOG ASTRONAUT STRELKA'S PUPPIES AS A GIFT TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
AN APPRECIATIVE MESSAGE WAS SENT BACK TO THE SOVIET PREMIER 
ACCEPTING DEFEAT JOHN F. KENNEDY ADMITTED 
THE FIRST CANINE PASSENGERS IN SPACE WERE NAMED STRELKA AND BELKA NOT ROVER OR FIDO 
THEY GOT US NOW 
WE'LL SEE 
THE AMERICANS HAVE YET TO PROVE THEY CAN EVEN GET AN ASTRONAUT OFF THE LAUNCH PAD 
THE FIRST OF VON BRAUN'S MODIFIED REDSTONES WITH AN UNMANNED MERCURY CAPSULE 
STANDS READY TO SEE IF IT'S UP TO THE TASK WATCHED BY THE WORLD'S MEDIA 
VON BRAUN CAN ONLY HOPE HE HAS ELIMINATED ALL REDSTONE'S PROBLEMS 
DEPUTY AND HEAD OF LAUNCH OPERATIONS AT THE CAPE KURT DEBUS HAD WISHED FOR MORE TESTS 
BUT DEFENCE STATUS INDICATORS HAVE BEEN OFFLINE 
ARE THEY WORKING NOW 
THEY ARE FUNCTIONING AT PRESENT BUT 
VON BRAUN DO YOU READ ROGER COPY 
HOW YOU ALL DOING DO I HAVE A SCHEDULED FLIGHT 
YEP COUNTDOWN RUNNING A O. K. 
O. K. COPY THAT STAY ON THE LOOP 
CHRIS KRAFT FLIGHT DIRECTOR OVERSEES THE COUNTDOWN 
GENTLEMAN THE CLOCK READS T. MINUS TEN MINUTES 
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU ALL AT YOUR CONSOLES PLEASE 
IF TODAY'S TEST IS A SUCCESS A DATE CAN BE SET FOR A MANNED FLIGHT 
T. MINUS TWENTY SECONDS AND COUNTING 
CAPSULE 
GO FLIGHT COMMUNICATIONS 
GO FLIGHT RANGE OFFICER 
GO FLIGHT LAUNCHER 
WE ARE GO GO FLIGHT 
O. K. 
I HAVE AN ALL GO ALL GO 
T. MINUS TEN AND COUNTING 
NINE EIGHT SEVEN SIX 
FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE 
IGNITION SEQUENCES ARE GO 
ENGINES GO WE HAVE A LIFT OFF AND THE CLOCK IS STARTED 
LOOK AT THE ACCELERATION ON THAT SON OF A BITCH 
WE HAVE A BLOCK WE HAVE ENGINE SHUTDOWN WHAT'S THAT 
ROCKET IS STILL THERE 
ABORT WHAT 
ENGINE SHUTDOWN WE HAVE AN ENGINE SHUTDOWN 
WILL SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON 
NOBODY CAN SEE IT HERE 
WILL SOMEONE TALK TO ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKES 
TALK TO ME DAMN IT 
DAMN GERMANS STILL HAVEN'T LEARNED WHO THEY WORK FOR 
LATER FILM REVEALS THAT ONLY THE ESCAPE TOWER WAS LAUNCHED 
IN A HUMILIATING PUBLIC SPECTACLE 
THE ROCKET ITSELF HAD ONLY LIFTED FOUR INCHES OFF THE PAD 
THE UNITED STATES' HOPES OF PUTTING A MAN INTO SPACE WAS DEALT A CRUSHING BLOW TODAY BY YET ANOTHER FAILURE 
ONE OFFICIAL SAID THAT THIS MIGHT HAVE COST THE NATION ITS LAST CHANCE 
TO BEAT THE SOVIET UNION IN THE RACE TO SEND THE FIRST MAN ALOFT 
WITH EVERY SOVIET LAUNCH KEPT TOP SECRET HOW MUCH PROGRESS 
THEY ARE MAKING IS ALWAYS A GUESSING GAME FOR THE AMERICANS 
BUT WHY THE DELAY CAN NO ONE TELL ME 
GLUSHKO'S NEW ENGINE IS READY TO BE TESTED IN A MISSILE 
BUT THERE IS A MAJOR FUEL LEAK 
COMRADE MARSHAL IT WOULD NOT BE WISE TO REPAIR THE LEAK ON A FUELLED ROCKET 
BUT WE MUST YOU COULD DO IT IN A NUCLEAR WAR 
PLEASE CAN I ASK YOU COMRADE MARSHAL TO MOVE BACK TO A SAFE VANTAGE POINT 
RUSSIAN 
CAN'T YOU SEE I'M STAYING HERE VERY GOOD 
MARSHAL NEDELIN HAS KEPT THE LAUNCH TEAM WORKING 
FOR SEVENTY TWO HOURS WITHOUT REST HANDLING THE HIGHLY DANGEROUS FUEL 
THE SOVIETS DESPERATELY NEED A NEW GENERATION OF MISSILES TO COUNTER THE AMERICAN NUCLEAR THREAT 
MARSHAL NEDELIN WON'T EVEN LET THE FIRING CIRCUITRY BE DISCONNECTED 
AN ELECTRICAL FAULT SENDS SIGNALS WHICH TRIGGER THE ROCKET'S SECOND STAGE 
IN TEMPERATURES OF THREE THOUSAND DEGREES 
THE SURROUNDING TARMAC MELTED 
TRAPPING PEOPLE IN A STICKY FLOOR OF FIRE 
THE MOST HORRIFIC FATE BEFELL THOSE SUSPENDED 
FROM HARNESSES IN THE GANTRY WHO BURST INTO FLAMES LIKE CANDLES 
THE INFERNO KILLS NINETY TWO OF THE SOVIET UNION'S SENIOR ENGINEERS AND MILITARY OFFICERS 
COMRADE GLUSHKO 
WE FOUND THIS 
IT BELONGED TO MARSHAL NEDELIN 
IS THAT ALL 
YES 
THE LOSS OF THE ENGINEERS DEALS A DEVASTATING BLOW TO THE SOVIET SPACE PROGRAM 
THE DISASTER IS KEPT SECRET FOR THIRTY YEARS 
MAKE ME OLD BEFORE MY TIME 
WOO GUYS I WOULD'VE BEEN COOKED ON THAT ONE 
THAT WOULDN'T BE GOOD FRIED LIKE AN EGG GETTING TOO OLD FOR THIS 
YEAH I THINK I WOULD'VE BEEN SCRAMBLED AS WELL 
OH MAN O. K. GENTLEMEN 
IF I COULD HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE 
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU IS CONFIDENTIAL 
I WOULD LIKE YOU ALL TO KEEP IT THAT WAY 
ALAN SHEPARD WILL MAKE THE FIRST SUB ORBITAL REDSTONE FLIGHT 
WHEN DO WE GO 
WE'VE PENCILLED IT FOR APRIL TWELFTH IF EVERYTHING GOES WELL WITH THE NEXT TEST 
THAT'S IN TWELVE WEEKS' TIME 
THANK YOU GENTLEMAN CONGRATULATIONS 
CONGRATULATIONS GOD MAN YEAH THANKS 
GOOD JOB AL THANKS 
NASA NOW HAS JUST TWELVE WEEKS TO ANSWER ONE CRITICAL QUESTION 
CAN ALAN SHEPARD OR INDEED ANY HUMAN BEING SURVIVE THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL STRESS OF SPACE FLIGHT 
FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE 
TO FIND OUT ANOTHER REDSTONE IS LAUNCHED 
THIS TIME IT'S NOT JUST VON BRAUN'S REPUTATION THAT'S AT RISK BUT ALSO THE LIFE OF ITS PASSENGER 
FUEL IS GO EIGHTEEN G. 
CABIN PRESSURE FOURTEEN P. S. I. 
HEADING FOR SPACE IS CHIMP NUMBER SIXTY FIVE 
IF THE FLIGHT IS A SUCCESS SHEPARD IS NEXT 
OXYGEN IS GO LOOKING GOOD 
IF CHIMP SIXTY FIVE SURVIVES THE FIFTEEN MINUTE FLIGHT NASA WILL GIVE HIM A NAME 
IF NOT HE'LL REMAIN JUST A NUMBER 
FOUR G.'S CABIN PRESSURE HOLDING AT FIFTY FIVE 
SPEED ACCELERATING TO MACH TWELVE 
ONE POINT THREE FOURTEEN FIFTEEN 
THE ACCELERATION'S MUCH TOO QUICK 
WE'VE GOT BAD VERY BAD VIBRATIONS 
SHE IS SHAKING HARD STILL ACCELERATING 
NINE G. MACH TWENTY EIGHT STILL ACCELERATING WHAT NOW VON BRAUN DO WE ABORT 
ESCAPE TOWER FIRED CAPSULE DETACHED 
SEVENTEEN G. HE'S CLOSE TO G. LOC 
G. LOC THE MOMENT WHEN CHIMP SIXTY FIVE WILL LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS 
DEATH WILL FOLLOW SWIFTLY 
HOLD ON THERE LITTLE FELLOW 
AFTER A NEAR DISASTROUS FLIGHT ASTRO CHIMP HAM SPLASHED DOWN SAFELY 
HE WAS RESCUED BY NAVY HELICOPTERS 
THE LITTLE CHIMP DIDN'T SEEM TOO WORRIED ABOUT HIS ORDEAL 
BUT TONIGHT NASA MUST BE ASKING THEMSELVES IS IT SAFE ENOUGH YET TO SEND A MAN INTO SPACE 
TODAY A CONTRACEPTIVE PILL WHICH WOMEN TAKE ORALLY WENT ON THE MARKET FOR THE FIRST TIME 
GENTLEMEN YOU DON'T NEED ME TO TELL YOU WE'RE NOT EXACTLY IN NASA'S GOOD BOOKS TODAY 
WHAT WENT WRONG WELL FIRST STUDY OF THE DATA SUGGESTS 
THE FUEL PUMPS WERE OVERDRIVEN CAUSING EXCESSIVE ACCELERATION 
THE ROCKET ROSE TOO STEEPLY 
THE ABORT SYSTEM TRIGGERED PULLING THE CAPSULE AWAY FROM THE ROCKET 
THE CHIMP WAS LUCKY TO SURVIVE 
SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE PUMP SYSTEM AND FIND OUT WHY THEY RAN SO FAST 
NOW WE HAVE A DIFFICULT DECISION TO MAKE 
ARE WE READY TO SEND A MAN OR DO WE NEED ANOTHER TEST FLIGHT 
IF WE DELAY 
WELL WE RISK LOSING OUT TO THE COMMUNISTS 
IF WE GO A FATALITY COULD COST US OUR ENTIRE SPACE PROJECT 
RAISE YOUR HANDS IF YOU ARE READY TO PROCEED WITH A MANNED FLIGHT 
I NEED A UNANIMOUS DECISION 
WE NEED ANOTHER FLIGHT 
WE MUST HAVE ONE FLIGHT WITH ONE HUNDRED PER CENT SUCCESS 
I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THIS 
THANK YOU GENTLEMEN 
AL 
THEY WANT ANOTHER FLIGHT 
WHAT VON BRAUN AND HIS TEAM WANT ANOTHER TEST FLIGHT BEFORE YOU GO 
IT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND IT CAN BE FIXED RIGHT 
WHY DON'T WE MAN THE NEXT ONE 
WHEN IT COMES TO ROCKETS WERNHER IS KING 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE JOKING NOW I'VE VIEWED ALL THE DATA FROM THAT FLIGHT 
AND EVEN WITH ALL THE PROBLEMS I WOULD HAVE SURVIVED LIKE HAM FOR CHRIST'S SAKE LET'S JUST FLY 
LIKE I SAID WERNHER IS KING 
OH SHIT 
ANOTHER REDSTONE TEST WILL DELAY SHEPARD'S FLIGHT FOR A MONTH 
BUT IT MAY ALREADY BE TOO LATE 
THE C. I. A. PICK UP FAINT SIGNALS OF A RUSSIAN VOICE COMING FROM SPACE 
THE MYSTERY VOICE RETURNS TO EARTH AND LANDS IN A REMOTE RUSSIAN VILLAGE 
IN FACT COSMONAUT IVAN IVANOVICH IS NOTHING MORE THAN A DUMMY WITH A TAPE RECORDER INSIDE 
BUT THE SOVIETS ARE NOW CLOSE TO SENDING A REAL MAN INTO SPACE 
THE QUESTION IS WHO 
FOR SUCH A HISTORIC MISSION KOROLEV NEEDS THE APPROVAL OF THE POLITBURO 
WHILE THEY DECIDE EACH COSMONAUT IS FILMED GIVING HIS FAREWELL SPEECH 
PEOPLE OF ALL COUNTRIES AND CONTINENTS 
IN A FEW MINUTES 
THIS SPACESHIP 
WILL CARRY ME OFF ON A HISTORIC MISSION 
I BID YOU FAREWELL 
CUT NEXT 
GHERMAN TITOV INTELLIGENT 
PHYSICALLY RESILIENT BUT HIS BACKGROUND WELL TOO BOURGEOIS 
HOW ABOUT YURI GAGARIN 
CONFIDENT INTELLIGENT WELL LIKED IDEOLOGICALLY SOUND 
DEAR FRIENDS 
FELLOW CITIZENS 
PARENTS GREW UP ON A COLLECTIVE FARM 
FATHER WAS A CARPENTER SON OF THE PEOPLE 
TO BE THE FIRST TO ENTER THE COSMOS 
WHO CAN DREAM OF ANYTHING MORE 
UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN 
PERFECT 
THE SOVIETS HAVE THEIR COSMONAUT BUT THERE ARE DOUBTS ABOUT THE SPACECRAFT 
TWO MORE DOG FLIGHTS HAVE FAILED ANOTHER PAIR BURNED TO DEATH ON RE ENTRY 
KOROLEV NEEDS TIME OR THIS COULD BE GAGARIN'S FATE 
AND THE AMERICANS ARE CATCHING UP FAST 
A PERFECT LAUNCH AND A PERFECT FLIGHT DOCTOR VON BRAUN WAS DELIGHTED 
THE FLIGHT WAS A GREAT SUCCESS 
NOW WE CAN PROCEED TO PUT THE FIRST AMERICAN INTO SPACE 
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ME WE HAD 'EM BY THE SHORT HAIRS AND WE GAVE IT AWAY 
THE CAPSULE WAS RECOVERED BY NAVY VESSELS AND WINCHED ABOARD 
IT CAN'T BE LONG NOW BEFORE THE CAPSULE CARRIES ALOFT COMMANDER ALAN SHEPARD 
IN JUST FOUR WEEKS SHEPARD COULD HAVE FLOWN 
THE R. SEVEN IS PREPARED FOR GAGARIN'S HISTORIC ATTEMPT 
AFTER THE RECENT FAILURES 
KOROLEV KNOWS GAGARIN'S CHANCE OF SURVIVAL IS LITTLE BETTER THAN FIFTY PER CENT 
SENIOR LIEUTENANT GAGARIN READY FOR THE FIRST FLIGHT IN THE SPACESHIP VOSTOK 
COME BACK 
I'M NOT SEEING THE K. P. THREE LIGHT SHOWING THE HATCH IS SEALED 
REMEMBER YURI EVERYTHING YOU SAY IS BEING RECORDED 
IT'S TIME 
THE SIDE BOOSTERS HAVE SEPARATED 
PRESSURE IN THE CHAMBERS IS THREE 
THE FLIGHT PROCEEDS WELL 
THREE MINUTES AFTER LIFT OFF 
THE CENTRAL BOOSTER ACCELERATES GAGARIN TO SEVENTEEN FIVE HUNDRED M. P. H. 
FIVE MINUTES AFTER LIFT OFF 
AND GAGARIN IS THE FIRST HUMAN EVER TO LOOK BACK ON OUR PLANET FROM SPACE 
COVERED BY RAIN CLOUDS 
AND NOW I CAN SEE THE CURVATURE OF THE EARTH 
NINE MINUTES INTO HIS FLIGHT ALL SENSATIONS OF SPEED STOP 
AND THE EFFECT OF GRAVITY IS LOST 
EVERYTHING IS GOING WELL 
THE FEELING OF WEIGHTLESSNESS IS GREAT IT DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL SICK 
I LIKE IT 
WE CAN HARDLY HEAR YOU 
I FEEL SAFE YURI I CAN HARDLY 
GAGARIN TRAVELS BEYOND THE RANGE OF THE TELEVISION RECEIVERS AT THE LAUNCH SITE 
LESS THAN THIRTY MINUTES AFTER LAUNCH VOSTOK SWEEPS OUT OVER THE PACIFIC 
AND TOWARDS THE VAST SHADOW OF NIGHT 
SOON GAGARIN IS ORBITING ABOVE A SLEEPING AMERICA ITS CITIZENS UNAWARE OF THE COMMUNISTS' TRIUMPH 
AFTER JUST AN HOUR CALCULATIONS FOR RE ENTRY ARE MADE 
TOO STEEP AND GAGARIN WILL BURN UP 
TOO SHALLOW AND HE WILL MOVE INTO A HIGHER ORBIT NEVER TO RETURN 
PREPARE TO FIRE RETROS 
FIRE 
NOW THE SERVICE MODULE CONTAINING THE USED RETRO ROCKETS MUST BE DETACHED FROM HIS CAPSULE 
HAS THE SERVICE MODULE DETACHED 
NO SEPARATION 
CHECK AGAIN 
NO SEPARATION 
IF THE TWO PARTS REMAIN JOINED GAGARIN WILL BE SPUN TO HIS DEATH 
RADIO CONTACT IS LOST 
ALL KOROLEV CAN DO NOW IS WAIT 
AT THE FINAL MOMENT THE HEAT OF RE ENTRY HAD BURNT THROUGH THE CABLES 
AND THE VOSTOK HAD BROKEN FREE OF THE SERVICE MODULE 
MOMENTS LATER FOUR MILES ABOVE THE EARTH A SHAKEN GAGARIN HAD EJECTED FROM HIS CAPSULE 
HEY 
IN A FLIGHT LASTING ONE HUNDRED EIGHT MINUTES 
GAGARIN HAD TRAVELLED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MILES 
THE FIRST HUMAN TO ORBIT THE EARTH 
HE LANDED SAFELY 
DEAR COMRADES 
TO OUR SUCCESS 
WAIT 
THE CHIEF DESIGNER COULD DO THAT 
BUT COMRADES WE CAN'T 
WHO WOULD ANSWER TO THE SUPPLIES DIVISION 
GAGARIN FLIES TO MOSCOW TO BE GREETED BY PREMIER KHRUSHCHEV 
AND AN ECSTATIC SOVIET PEOPLE 
BUT KOROLEV IS FORCED TO WATCH FROM THE SIDELINES 
THE K. G. B. STILL INSISTING HIS IDENTITY WAS KEPT SECRET 
THESE PICTURES COMING LIVE FROM MOSCOW 
WE SEE MAJOR LIEUTENANT YURI GAGARIN THE FIRST MAN INTO SPACE 
GREETING PREMIER KHRUSHCHEV AND OTHER MEMBERS 
HERR DOCTOR YEAH 
ARE YOU WATCHING 
IT'S LIVE FROM MOSCOW THE SOVIET COSMONAUT IS MEETING KHRUSHCHEV 
YES 
THANK YOU 
GAGARIN RECEIVES A WARM WELCOME FROM THE PREMIER 
HE IS CLEARLY OVERCOME WITH EMOTION 
LESS THAN A MONTH AFTER GAGARIN 
NASA IS ALMOST READY TO SEND ALAN SHEPARD 
O. K. GUYS 
I'M IN HERE 
O. K. 
WELL GENTLEMEN CAN I HAVE EVERYONE'S ATTENTION 
DUE TO ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS I'M GOING TO DELAY THE FLIGHT 
OH JEEZ 
HOLD COUNTDOWN 
DID YOU COPY THAT ALAN SIT TIGHT BUDDY COPY 
SITTING TIGHT WITH NOWHERE TO GO 
SHEPARD'S CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS THROUGH FELLOW ASTRONAUT GORDON COOPER 
WHEN THE WEATHER CLEARS SHEPARD HAS BEEN SITTING IN HIS CAPSULE FOR FIVE HOURS 
O. K. GUYS I'VE BEEN UP HERE TOO LONG NOW I GOT TO TAKE A LEAK 
I CAN'T HOLD ON ANY MORE 
HOW ABOUT IT WERNHER NO NO THERE'S NO TIME TO GET HIM IN AND OUT OF THE SUIT 
NO WAY ALAN WERNHER SAYS YOU'RE IN THERE TO STAY 
WELL SHIT GORDO WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING 
TELL WERNHER I CAN'T WAIT 
DAMN IT TELL HIM I'M GONNA LET IT GO IN MY SUIT 
RATHER THAN LOSE ANOTHER FLIGHT VON BRAUN RELENTS 
O. K. POWER'S OFF GO TO IT 
THANK GOD I'M GONNA GO AHEAD 
T. MINUS TEN AND COUNTING 
NINE EIGHT SEVEN SIX FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE 
IGNITION SEQUENCE IS GO 
ENGINES GO WE HAVE LIFT OFF THE CLOCK HAS STARTED 
YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY JOSE ROGER THAT READ YOU LOUD AND CLEAR 
GO BABY GO 
DURING HIS SIXTEEN MINUTE SUB ORBITAL FLIGHT SHEPARD TRAVELS JUST THREE HUNDRED MILES 
AND EXPERIENCES WEIGHTLESSNESS FOR SIX MINUTES 
JUST LONG ENOUGH FOR VON BRAUN TO CLAIM AMERICA TOO HAS PUT A MAN IN SPACE 
BUT A BOLDER INITIATIVE IS NEEDED TO BEAT THE SOVIETS IN THIS COLD WAR BATTLEGROUND 
THE NEW PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY SOON ANNOUNCES IT 
THE EYES OF THE WORLD NOW LOOK INTO SPACE 
AND WE HAVE VOWED THAT WE SHALL NOT SEE IT GOVERNED 
BY A HOSTILE FLAG OF CONQUEST BUT BY A BANNER OF FREEDOM 
WE CHOOSE TO GO TO THE MOON 
WE CHOOSE TO GO TO THE MOON IN THIS DECADE AND DO THE OTHER THINGS 
NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD 
AMERICA CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE 
A FEW MONTHS AFTER SHEPARD'S FLIGHT EAST GERMAN BORDER GUARDS START ERECTING THE BERLIN WALL 
THE POSSIBILITY OF ALL OUT NUCLEAR CONFLICT INTENSIFIES 
WHOEVER SENDS A MAN AROUND THE MOON WILL HAVE AS GOOD AS WON THE RACE 
WITHOUT A ROCKET AS POWERFUL AS SATURN WE WILL LOSE 
THE RUSSIANS BEAT US INTO SPACE 
I'M NOT GONNA SEE THEM BEAT US ONTO THE MOON 
YOU HAVE ACHIEVED YOUR OBJECTIVES RETURN TO THE SPACECRAFT 
I CAN'T PULL MYSELF BACK TO THE AIRLOCK 
THEY WANNA BEAT US TO THE MOON AND THEY MAY SURPRISE US ANY DAY NOW
