ALL RIGHT I'M NOT CALLING OUT OF A SENSE OF DUTY OR ANYTHING 
ALL RIGHT 
SO GIVE ME A RING THEN WHEN YOU LAND AND 
HAVE A SAFE TRIP 
BYE 
SO SHE JUMPS ONTO THE TRACKS GIVES HIM C. P. R. SAVES HIS LIFE THEN DISAPPEARS INTO THE CROWD AGAIN 
AND TRANSPORT POLICE WANTED TO I. D. THE MUGGER WHO WAS UNCONSCIOUS 
SO THEY SWABBED HIS MOUTH BUT THEY GOT TWO D. N. A. STRANDS FROM THE SAMPLE 
HIS AND HERS AND HERS BECAUSE SHE GAVE HIM MOUTH TO MOUTH YEAH 
EXACTLY SO THEY SEPARATED THE STRANDS AND HERS FLAGGED UP AS BEING LINKED TO ONE OF OUR CASES 
SO WHAT IS THE LINK HER D. N. A. WAS FOUND ON A MURDER SCENE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE YEAH 
SO I'VE PULLED THE VICTIM'S REMAINS IN EVIDENCE BAGS INTO THE LAB HEY IT'S ME 
I JUST GOT YOUR MESSAGE AND I'VE LANDED IN KENNEDY 
ARE YOU O. K. 
YES PATCH SMOKER'S PATCH I'VE GOT TO KICK THE HABIT 
'. I'M SO SORRY 
I MISS YOU 
ER LET'S GO INTO THE 
CASE NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN B. APPROXIMATELY NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE 
SHE WAS FOUND BY THE LONDON FIRE BRIGADE ON THE NINETEENTH OF AUGUST NINETEEN NINETY THREE 
WHEN THEY RESPONDED TO A FIRE IN A DISUSED CONTAINER YARD 
MOST PROBABLE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS A SINGLE GUNSHOT TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD 
AS YOU CAN SEE MOST OF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FACE HAS BEEN DESTROYED 
LUCKILY THE BODY'S NOT BURNT TO A POINT BEYOND D. N. A. RETRIEVAL 
A BLOOD PATTERN ANALYSIS CARRIED OUT ON THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTAINER 
SUPPORTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE VICTIM WAS KILLED ON SITE 
IT WAS DURING THE ORIGINAL FORENSIC SWEEP THAT THEY FOUND THE SECOND 
D. N. A. SAMPLE ON CHAINS HANGING FROM THE CEILING OF THE CONTAINER 
THAT'S OUR C. P. R. WOMAN FROM THE TRAIN STATION YESTERDAY THAT'S CORRECT 
THE ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION WAS HANDLED BY THE VICE SQUAD 
BECAUSE THE AREA'S KNOWN FOR PROSTITUTION BUT THEY HIT A DEAD END 
I TAKE IT THEY RAN A PROFILE OF TWENTY SEVEN B. THROUGH MISSING PERSONS 
YES THEY DID BUT IN THAT YEAR ALONE OVER TWO THOUSAND WOMEN UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE WERE REPORTED MISSING 
WHAT AN EXCUSE IT'S PATHETIC 
YOUNG RUNAWAYS WHO DON'T WANT TO BE FOUND MAKE THE PERFECT VICTIMS 
SO THE OWNER OF THE D. N. A. ON THE CHAINS IN THE CONTAINER AND THAT'S THE TRAIN STATION WOMAN 
YEAH IS EITHER THE KILLER OR A WITNESS TO THE MURDER OF TWENTY SEVEN B. 
I'D LIKE TO RUN TESTS ON THE MATERIAL THIS MATERIAL THAT WAS FOUND WITH TWENTY SEVEN B. 
I'D LIKE TO RE RUN BOTH D. N. A.'S ACROSS OUR DATABASE 
I'D LIKE TO RUN SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS AND CARRY OUT SOME STABLE ISOTOPE PROFILING 
ON THE BONE MARROW THE BULLET WAS NEVER FOUND 
NO THERE WAS NO BULLET NO CASING 
SO THEIR INTENTION WAS TO CLEAN UP AND DESTROY THE EVIDENCE THEY'D HAVE BROUGHT THE PETROL 
AND THE GUN WITH THEM SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY PREMEDITATED 
UNIDENTIFIED POLYRESIN I WAS COMING TO THAT THIS 
FORMERLY UNIDENTIFIED POLYRESIN OR PLASTIC 
I DID AN ENHANCED PGC TEST 
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS A PIECE OF VIDEOCASSETTE 
RIGHT THEY WERE MAKING MOVIES IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY RELATE TO THIS INCIDENT 
LOOK A CHAINED GIRL TORTURE I THINK WE KNOW WHAT KIND OF MOVIES 
THEY WERE MAKING BUT WAS IT BONDAGE PORN OR A SNUFF MOVIE 
WHY WOULD THEY GO MAKE A SNUFF MOVIE AND THEN BURN IT WITH THE VICTIM 
SOMETHING WENT WRONG MAYBE THEY WANTED TO MAKE A BONDAGE MOVIE 
THAT WENT PAST THE POINT OF NO RETURN WELL THEY'D HAVE A SNUFF MOVIE 
THE EMERGENCY CALL WAS MADE BY A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD PROSTITUTE CALLED ROSE DELANEY 
I'LL TRY AND TRACK HER DOWN 
THIS IS THE C. C. T. V. 
THERE'S ALSO THE MOBILE PHONE FOOTAGE BUT IT'S BEING WORKED ON 
SO WOMAN TWO KIDS RIGHT 
SCUFFLE ON THE PLATFORM 
THE MUGGER ENDS UP ON THE TRACKS SHE GIVES HIM MOUTH TO MOUTH THAT'S WHERE WE GET THE D. N. A. 
IS THIS THE ONLY CAMERA YOU CAN'T TELL WHETHER IT'S THE SAME WOMAN 
SHE JUMPED ONTO A LIVE TRACK THAT'S INSANE ANYBODY WOULD IT'S INSTINCT 
THE GUY ROBBED A HANDBAG HE DOESN'T DESERVE TO DIE 
BUT MOST PEOPLE WOULD PANIC NOBODY ELSE JUMPED DOWN TO SAVE HIM 
SHE DOESN'T PANIC NO BECAUSE SHE'S TOTALLY CONFIDENT 
CALL AN AMBULANCE 
SHE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S DOING SHE GIVES C. P. R. SHE PUTS HIM IN THE RECOVERY POSITION 
BUT THEN THE STRANGEST THING IS WHEN SHE'S MADE HIM SAFE AND WHEN THE MEDICS ARRIVE 
SHE QUITS THE SCENE 
SHE'S GOT TWO KIDS MAYBE SHE DOESN'T WANT THEM IN THE PUBLIC EYE 
SHE'S ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE ON THE PLANET WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE ON T. V. 
BUT MAYBE SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE IN THE PUBLIC EYE IT'S A SEX THING OR SHE HAS SOMETHING TO HIDE 
CHAINS CONTAINERS HELLO DO WE HAVE CONTAINMENT 
NO WE DON'T THE LOCAL NEWS WERE ALREADY THERE WHEN I WENT TO GET THE TAPE 
O. K. I'VE LOCATED THE NINETEEN NINETY THREE WITNESS ROSE DELANEY 
ALL RIGHT BRING HER IN AND WE NEED THIS WOMAN HER CONNECTION 
WITH TWENTY SEVEN B. AND WHAT THEY WERE DOING WITH THOSE CHAINS 
O. K. LET'S SEE IT AGAIN 
THERE'S ONLY SO MANY OPTIONS YOU'VE GOT 
CHAINS IS EITHER PLEASURE OR PAIN ISN'T IT OR BOTH 
OR BOTH YEAH THE HOMELESS UNIT ARE TRYING TO IDENTIFY A YOUNG MALE 
FOUND ON THE STREETS SUFFERING FROM MEMORY LOSS 
HE TOLD THEM HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO HE WAS 
WHEN THEY RAN HIS D. N. A. IT ALERTED US 
I COULDN'T ACCESS ANYTHING THERE'S NO COLD CASE REFERENCE NUMBER FOR IT 
JUST A NOTE TO CONTACT YOU 
YOU O. K. 
YEAH 
THIS WILL GET YOU THE FILE IF YOU CAN JUST 
FIND OUT WHERE THEY'RE KEEPING HIM 
O. K. AND WHAT'S IT IN CONNECTION WITH 
OH IT'S A CASE I WAS INVOLVED WITH WAY BACK 
KEEP IT BETWEEN US 
YEAH COURSE 
DAD DID YOU SEE IT I JUST DID A STEPOVER 
SEE 
ALL READY 
BOYD MM O. K. YEAH YEAH 
THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO DIE A GOOD PLACE TO KILL 
YOU COULD SCREAM YOUR LUNGS OUT HERE AND NOBODY'D HEAR YOU 
I'M ASSUMING SNUFF MOVIES HAVE A KIND OF TORTURE BUILD UP 
THEY USUALLY FOLLOW A PATTERN THE VICTIM'S TORTURED RAPED 
THEN THE BODY'S MUTILATED AND DURING THE PROCESS OF MUTILATION THE VICTIM DIES 
IT'S THE ACTUAL KILLING THAT DEFINES IT AS A SNUFF MOVIE YEAH 
YEAH IT'S THAT LAST LITTLE FLUTTER OF LIFE IN THE EYES AND THAT'S THE MONEY SHOT 
SO SHE WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD 
PERHAPS BY THAT TIME SHE WAS BEGGING TO DIE 
YOU READY 
YES GO ON 
MY GOD POOR BASTARDS IT'S GROTESQUE 
LOOK AT THESE D'YOU THINK THEY KILLED MORE THAN ONE PERSON AT A TIME WHEN THEY 
PLEASE PRESUMABLY SHE WAS HUNG BY CHAINS FROM ONE OF THESE HOOKS 
HERE'S THE SMOKE DAMAGE WHERE THE BODY WAS BURNT 
SO THE METHOD OF DISPOSAL WOULD'VE WORKED IF THE FIRE 
ENGINES HADN'T BEEN CALLED OUT BEFORE THE EVIDENCE WAS DESTROYED 
YOU BRING THEM TO A PLACE THAT NOBODY CARES ABOUT AND THEN YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT TO THEM 
THEY GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE VICTIM AND PLACE SHARE THE SAME SOCIAL VALUE NOBODY GIVES A TOSS 
IT BEGS THE QUESTION THOUGH WHO'S WORSE 
THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE THESE MOVIES OR THE PEOPLE WHO WATCH 'EM HEY 
HEY COME HERE I DIDN'T LOCK THE BLOODY CAR 
MY BAG'S IN THAT CAR 
BOYD 
ARE YOU O. K. DID YOU NICK ANYTHING FROM THAT CAR DID YOU EH

IF YOU'RE THAT FEEBLE YOU SHOULDN'T BE MUGGING PEOPLE IN THE FIRST PLACE 
NO SHE WAS QUICK AND WELL STRONG 
SO ARE YOU GONNA DO HER NO 
COS NINE OUT OF TEN PEOPLE WOULD'VE LEFT YOU DEAD ON THE TRACKS

YOU WANT ME TO DO IT YEAH I THINK THAT'S BEST DON'T YOU YEAH 
THANKS GRACE 
FOR THAT 
WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT 
IT'S ABOUT AUGUST NINETEENTH NINETEEN NINETY THREE 
YOU RANG THE EMERGENCY SERVICES 
YES WHY WERE YOU DOWN THERE 
I DON'T I DON'T REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT 
BUT A YOUNG GIRL WAS KILLED IN THE CONTAINER THAT NIGHT 
AND THE FIRE YOU SAW WAS STARTED BY THE KILLER WHO WAS TRYING TO DESTROY THE EVIDENCE 
SO YOU SEE I REALLY DO NEED YOUR MEMORIES OF THAT NIGHT 
I HADN'T BEEN DOWN THERE IN THE CONTAINER YARD FOR THAT LONG 
A FEW WEEKS 
I'D JUST COME DOWN FROM HOME 
YOU'D RUN AWAY YES 
FROM BRADFORD 
SO HOW DID YOU FIND THAT PLACE 
I MET SOMEONE IN VICTORIA STATION HE TOLD ME ABOUT IT 
IT'S WHERE THEY WAIT TRAIN STATIONS BUS STATIONS WHO 
PIMPS 
THE ONES WHO LOOK FOR NEW GIRLS 
SO YOU MET A MAN 
YES 
HE CALLED HIMSELF B. B. 
HE SEEMED LIKE A DECENT GUY 
CUTE ACCENT 
WHAT SORT OF AN ACCENT 
ALGERIAN 
SO HE SHOWED ME THE PLACE 
THERE WERE PEOPLE LIVING THERE YOU KNOW IN THE CONTAINERS 
OH HE HAD THIS LINE HE'D SPIN TO ALL THE GIRLS ABOUT HOW HE COULDN'T GO HOME AND ALL THAT 
HE WAS A REVOLUTIONIST FROM THE KASBAH 
HE WAS JUST A DIRTY LITTLE PIMP 
WAS HE AROUND THAT NIGHT HE WAS ALWAYS AROUND 
DID YOU SEE HIM THAT NIGHT 
I SAW HIS CAR WHAT WERE YOU DOING 
I WAS WAITING FOR MY NINE O'CLOCK GUY 
SO IT MUST'VE BEEN ABOUT QUARTER PAST EIGHT 
WHEN I SAW B. B.'S CAR DRIVE IN 
AND IT DROVE OFF THEN IT CAME BACK AGAIN LATER 
SO MY NINE O'CLOCK GUY TURNED UP 
WE WENT AND DID THE BUSINESS 
YEAH THAT'S WHEN I SAW THE FLAMES COMING FROM ONE OF THE CONTAINERS' OH MY GOD 
I NEEDED TO GET TO A PHONE MR. NINE O'CLOCK THOUGHT I WAS A NUT 
BUT YOU KNOW I KNEW PEOPLE LIVED IN THERE IT WASN'T JUST AN EMPTY CONTAINER YARD 
DID YOU TELL THE POLICE ABOUT B. B. 
NO 
WHY NOT 
BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID 
IT'S O. K. ROSE 
IF I WAS FIFTEEN AND ON MY OWN I'D HAVE BEEN AFRAID 
DID YOU EVER SEE THIS B. B. AGAIN 
NO 
NO 
THE COP WHO WAS IN CHARGE HE FOUND ME A PLACE IN A SHELTER 
I GOT MY ACT SORTED OUT 
EXCUSE ME I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU 
I'M DETECTIVE SUPERINTENDENT BOYD 
I'M HEADING THIS INVESTIGATION I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU IF YOU DON'T MIND 
WHEN YOU WERE WORKING AS A PROSTITUTE 
DID YOU COME ACROSS ANYONE MAKING TAPES 
TAPES PORN MOVIES 
WELL I WAS THINKING A LITTLE MORE VIOLENT THAN THAT SOME 
INVOLVING TORTURE YOU KNOW 
NO 
BUT IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME YOU KNOW MOST OF THE FACES DOWN THERE WERE KIDS 
ANYONE COULD'VE DONE ANYTHING THEY WANTED WITH THEM REALLY 
GET ON WITH IT 
CLOSE THE DOOR 
YOU SEEN THE NEWS 
I SAW IT 
SHE'S ALIVE AND ON THE RUN 
MIGHT TURN UP HERE HOW WOULD SHE FIND ME SAME WAY I DID 
SHE CONTACTS YOU 
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT 
O. K. 
COURSE IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING IT YOU MESS ME ABOUT I'LL CUT YOUR BALLS OFF AND PUT THEM IN A BLENDER 
SO WE'VE GOT THIS PIMP RIGHT 
ALGERIAN THE ONLY THING WE'VE GOT TO GO ON ARE HIS INITIALS B. B. 
BUT HE FITS THE GEOGRAPHICAL PROFILE IN THAT THE KILLER 
KNEW THE AREA CHOSE THE SPOT HAD ACCESS TO THE VICTIMS AND PRESUMABLY HAD THEIR TRUST 
I'VE DONE A SNIP AND AN ISOTOPIC ANALYSIS ON TWENTY SEVEN B.'S BONES AND IT'S MOST LIKELY THAT SHE'S ARAB 
ARAB 
I THINK THE SILK HOOD WAS IN FACT A HIJAB 
PREDOMINANTLY THE MUSLIM SILK WORN TODAY COMES OUT OF INDIA AND PAKISTAN 
BUT NOT THIS ONE THIS IS HOME SPUN 
MEANING RIGHT WELL THE SILK ROUTE RUNS WELL STARTS IN CHINA THEN RUNS TO PAKISTAN WEST 
AFGHANISTAN IRAN IRAQ WESTWARDS 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE THIS ROUTE WAS CLOSED WHEN RUSSIA INVADED AFGHANISTAN STOPPED IT IN THE MIDDLE EXACTLY 
AND THIS LED TO A REBIRTH OF THE HOME SPUN INDUSTRY IN ONE AREA THAT COULDN'T ACCESS THE GLOBAL MARKET 
SO THEY COULDN'T BUY IN OR SELL OUT NO THE TRADE WAS STOPPED OVERLAND IT WAS COMPLETELY SEALED OFF 
AND THAT WAS AND THAT WAS PALESTINE PALESTINE 
SHE'S PALESTINIAN WELL MOST LIKELY ARAB SHE'S WEARING A MUSLIM 
HEADDRESS IT'S MADE IN PALESTINE THERE'S STRONG PROBABILITY 
THIS CHANGES IT FOR ME I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT WE'VE GOT AN ALGERIAN HERE A FRENCH WOMAN 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PALESTINIAN WHO'S A PRACTICING MUSLIM 
DOES THIS SAY PROSTITUTION 
NO NO NOT AT ALL 
RIGHT I'VE JUST BEEN DOWNLOADING SOME NEWS BULLETINS 
SEEMS OUR FRIEND STEPHEN CARSON'S BEEN DOING DOORSTEP INTERVIEWS 
SO HE WANTS TO BE ON THE T. V. DOES HE UNLIKE HIS WIFE 
MY WIFE'S DONE NOTHING WRONG SHE'S JUST PROTECTING HER PRIVACY 
AND SHE BEHAVED LIKE ANY MOTHER WOULD PROTECTING HER CHILDREN 
I DON'T SEE WHY IT'S OF ANY INTEREST TO THE MEDIA 
WE'RE BEING STUPID THEY'VE BEEN MARRIED LONG ENOUGH HE'S GOT TO KNOW YEAH 
THE CURTAINS ARE PULLED 
YEAH 
PETROL 
STEPHEN 
AGH SORRY 
M. M. M. ALL RIGHT 
YEAH 
LOOK WHEN ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON 
NOT NOW I'M AFRAID 
IT'LL BE O. K. 
IT'LL BE FINE 
YOU THINK THE PERSON THAT DID THIS TO YOU WAS IRISH 
SHE DEFINITELY HAD AN IRISH ACCENT 
AND SHE WAS LOOKING FOR YOUR WIFE YES 
DID SHE SAY WHY SHE WAS LOOKING FOR YOUR WIFE NO 
BUT I SUPPOSE THE FACT THAT 
SOMEONE LIKE THAT'S LOOKING FOR MY WIFE HAS IMPLICATIONS IT DOES YEAH 
WHAT'S GOING ON 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN YOUR WIFE 
ERM TEN YEARS 
I MET HER WHEN I WAS TRAVELLING THROUGH FRANCE AND 
SHE WAS WORKING IN A CAFE 
SHE GOT PREGNANT 
WE MOVED BACK HERE SET UP HOME AND MADE A FAMILY 
DOES SHE WORK HERE NOW 
SHE'S BEEN A NURSE FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS 
DOES SHE EVER SPEAK ABOUT THE TIME THAT SHE SPENT HERE IN THE U. K. BEFORE YOU WERE MARRIED 
BEFORE

YES 
WE HAVE HER D. N. A. ON A MURDER SCENE DATING BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY THREE HERE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM 
WHAT YOU SAID YOU MET YOUR WIFE

YES SHE'S FIFTEEN UM 
LORE HAD TERESE BEFORE I MET HER 
WHO'S THE FATHER THE NATURAL 
HE'S DEAD UM I NEVER REALLY DISCUSSED IT MUCH WITH HER 
SHE'S YOUR STEPDAUGHTER THAT'S A BIT ODD DON'T YOU SPEAK ABOUT IT 
WELL I WAS 
I THOUGHT SHE'D TALK ABOUT IT WHEN SHE WAS READY 
AND I RECKONED IF SHE DIDN'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT SHE MUST HAVE GOOD REASONS 
ARE YOU O. K. 
NO 
MY CHILDREN ARE IN DANGER AND 
I THINK YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT MY WIFE THAN I DO 
SMILE BY LILY ALLEN 
YOU KNOW THIS IS SO SO DYSFUNCTIONAL 
I'M TRYING TO THINK WE'RE STUCK IN A SHIT BUCKET OF A HOTEL HIDING FROM I SAID 
WELL WHO ARE WE HIDING FROM THE POLICE 
I THINK THEY'RE LOOKING FOR ME IN CONNECTION TO SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO 
WELL HOW HOW LONG AGO 
BEFORE YOU WERE BORN 
SO WHAT IS IT 
A GIRL I KNEW SHE WAS KILLED 
O. K. SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO 
GIVE ME A COUPLE OF HOURS 
IF I CAN'T SORT THIS OUT THEN WE CALL THE POLICE 
I WON'T BE LONG 
LORE DUTANA WAS ARRESTED BY FRENCH BORDER POLICE IN PORT DE LARRAU 
ON THE SIXTEENTH OF OCTOBER NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHILE TRYING TO CROSS INTO SPAIN 
O. K. SHE WAS HELD FOR THREE HOLD ON HOLD ON SIXTEENTH OF OCTOBER NINETEEN NINETY TWO 
DOES THAT DATE MEAN ANYTHING TO ANYBODY 
SHE WAS HELD FOR THREE DAYS AND THEN RELEASED WITHOUT CHARGES 
WHAT WAS SHE ARRESTED FOR ALL IT SAYS IS SHE WAS TRAVELLING WITH A PERSON OF INTEREST 
I SAID I WANTED MORE DETAILS BUT THE FILE IS WITH INTERPOL I'LL GET ONTO IT 
SHALL I GO AND DO A C. D. FIT OF STEPHEN'S ATTACKER 
PLEASE PLEASE SO WE'VE GOT AN ALGERIAN PIMP CALLED B. B. WE'VE GOT A. 
PALESTINIAN WOMAN BURNT TO A CRISP A FRENCH WOMAN LORE DUTANA WHO WE NOW KNOW HAS A FILE WITH INTERPOL 
AND AN IRISH WOMAN WHO'S PARTICULARLY GOOD AT IMPROVISING EXPLOSIVE DEVICES 
MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL IN M. I FIVE 
YOU THINK WE'RE OUT OF OUR DEPTH WELL A LITTLE 
SO WHAT IS IT WITH THIS ATTACK ON STEPHEN 
WAS SHE EXPECTING LORE TO COME HOME PRESS THE BELL AND BLOW HIM SKY HIGH 
TAKING A RISK IF SHE DID WASN'T SHE 
WHAT'S MORE INTERESTING IS THE FACT THAT SHE DIDN'T KILL HIM 
SHE OBVIOUSLY WANTED HIM TO SUFFER SHE INFLICTED MENTAL CRUELTY ON HIM 
SO YOU'RE SUGGESTING THERE'S A HISTORY BETWEEN STEPHEN AND THE IRISH WOMAN 
OR BETWEEN THE IRISH WOMAN AND LORE YEAH EXACTLY 
OR IN FACT OR IN FACT ALL THREE 
ALL THREE 
O. K. 
SO WHAT DO THEY HAVE IN COMMON THESE PEOPLE

AND THIS IS WHERE LORE IS FROM BAYONNE THAT TO ME IS FRANCE 
IT IS AND IT ISN'T WATCH THIS IS EUSKADI WHAT WE CALL PAYS BASQUE
