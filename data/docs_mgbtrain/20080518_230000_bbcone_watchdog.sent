TONIGHT WE'VE SOLVED THE MYSTERY 
OF THE SOFAS THAT COULD LEAVE YOU IN AGONY WHEN YOU SIT ON THEM 
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER ONE 
AFTER HEARING THE RISKS WHY ARE SOME STORES STILL SELLING THEM 
AS THEY ALL BATTLE FOR OUR BUSINESS 
WHICH ENERGY COMPANY IS THE ONE EXPERTS NOW SAY IS BRITAIN'S WORST 
AND FROM THE FAST FOOD CHAIN WHERE WE FOUND E. COLI 
TO THE LATEST WHEEZE BY A COMPANY WHERE WE ARE BACK UNDER COVER 
MORE ON THE BIGGEST WATCHDOG STORIES OF THE YEAR 
HELLO WELCOME TO WATCHDOG LIVE FROM THE OFFICE FOR THE LAST TIME UNTIL THE AUTUMN 
TONIGHT WE WILL BE DISCOVERING WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WITH SOME OF THE STORIES WE HAVE INVESTIGATED 
INCLUDING THE LEATHER SOFAS 
THAT LEFT HUNDREDS OF YOU WITH AN AGONISING RASH LIKE THIS 
AND IF YOU THINK IT LOOKS BAD IMAGINE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE 
SINCE OUR LAST REPORT ON THIS WE HAVE WORKED OUT WHAT CAUSES 
THE PROBLEM BUT THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW OTHER TWISTS AND TURNS 
WE'VE PLENTY OF GOOD NEWS TONIGHT AS WELL 
AND WE'VE REPEATED A TEST WE DID LAST YEAR TO SEE HOW LONG SOME OF 
BRITAIN'S BIGGEST NAMES CAN HE KEEP YOU HANGING ON THE TELEPHONE LINE WHEN YOU RING THEM UP 
YOU CAN TEXT US 
ON ANY OF OUR STORIES 
OR ANY OF YOUR STORIES 
IT'LL COST THE PRICE OF A STANDARD TEXT 
OR YOU CAN EMAIL OR CALL US 
WE'LL READ THE DETAILS OUT AT THE END OF THE PROGRAMME 
FIRST WE'RE UNDER COVER 
FOR THE SECOND TIME IN A BUSINESS THAT'S FOUND A NEW WAY OF MISLEADING ITS CUSTOMERS 
MANY PEOPLE CAN GET INTO BOTHER OVER WHETHER THEY HAVE OR HAVE NOT TOLD THE TRUTH 
HERE'S ANOTHER DAVID REYNOLDS 
HARDLY A HOUSEHOLD NAME BUT HIS BUSINESSES 
ARE DEVELOPING QUITE A REPUTATION FOR BEING ECONOMICAL WITH THE TRUTH 
THIS IS THE H. Q. OF HIS MAIN OUTFIT HERE IN WEST SUSSEX 
SATELLITE DIRECT U. K. LIMITED 
A COMPANY WE REVEALED IN MARCH CAN ALL TOO OFTEN REPLACE FACT WITH FICTION 
THEY WERE SAY ANYTHING TO GET YOUR BUSINESS AND IF THAT MEANT LYING OR BULLYING NO PROBLEM 
IN FACT THAT'S HOW THEY TRAINED STAFF TO TREAT THEIR CUSTOMERS 
WE'D RECEIVED OVER ONE HUNDRED COMPLAINTS FROM PEOPLE SAYING THEY WERE SOLD WARRANTIES 
FOR THEIR SKY T. V. SYSTEM WHEN THEY DIDN'T NEED THEM 
BUT THEY BOUGHT THEM BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE TALKING TO SKY 
SO WE SENT A RESEARCHER TO WORK AT THE COMPANY UNDER COVER 
AND SHE WAS GIVEN A MASTERCLASS IN COLD CALLING TACTICS 
OH NO THEY'RE NOT ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE AT A CUSTOMER'S EXPENSE 
AND THE COMPANY HAS BEEN IN SERIOUS TROUBLE FOR TELLING THEM 
IN THE HIGH COURT SATELLITE DIRECT U. K. LIMITED WAS ORDERED TO STOP 
THEIR STAFF PASSING THEMSELVES OFF AS SKY WHEN CALLING POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS 
THE JUDGE CALLED THEIR SALES TECHNIQUES A BLATANT LIE 
OUR RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH STAFF DON'T ACTUALLY SAY THEY'RE FROM SKY 
THEY'RE HAPPY FOR CUSTOMERS TO GET THAT IMPRESSION 
WHEN WE FIRST INVESTIGATED THIS LOT THEY WERE CAREFUL TO AVOID ANSWERING 
OUR QUESTIONS AND HAVING THEIR LIES EXPOSED ON THE TELLY WASN'T ENOUGH 
TO MAKE THEM CHANGE THEIR WAYS BECAUSE PLENTY OF YOU ARE TELLING US THEY'RE STILL AT IT 
JUST TWO WEEKS AFTER OUR PROGRAMME 
ONE OF THEIR SALES STAFF CALLED HELEN LEE 
SHE WAS SAYING ABOUT THE WARRANTY RUNNING OUT 
THEY NEVER ACTUALLY SAID THEY WERE SKY BUT THEY 
MADE ME BELIEVE THEY WERE SKY AND I HAD NO DOUBTS THAT THEY WERE SKY 
HELEN SET UP A DIRECT DEBIT 
FOR WHAT SHE'D BEEN LED TO BELIEVE WAS A SKY WARRANTY 
SHE TRIED TO CANCEL AS SOON AS SHE FOUND OUT IT WASN'T 
THE PAPERWORK ARRIVED AND WHEN I SAW THE NAME SATELLITE DIRECT I RECOGNISED THE NAME 
AND THOUGHT OH NO THAT'S THE COMPANY I'D SEEN ON WATCHDOG 
AFTER HEARING LOTS MORE STORIES LIKE THAT 
WE WANTED TO GET BACK UNDERCOVER TO FIND OUT MORE AND GUESS WHAT 
THEY WERE STILL RECRUITING 
TWO WEEKS AGO WE SENT ANOTHER RESEARCHER TO WORK UNDERCOVER 
HE'S DISCOVERED IT'S NOT JUST WARRANTIES THEY TRAIN THEIR STAFF TO MISLEAD CUSTOMERS ABOUT 
THEY'VE GOT A WHOLE NEW TRICK UP THEIR SLEEVE 
THEY'LL STILL TRY TO SELL YOU SOMETHING YOU MAY NOT NEED BUT THIS TIME IT'S ONE OF THESE 
ON HIS FIRST DAY OUR RESEARCHER WAS TOLD HE WOULD BE WORKING IN ANOTHER PART OF DAVID REYNOLDS' EMPIRE 
A BUSINESS CALLED NOT JUST AERIALS WHO WILL COLD CALL 
MAKING OUT YOU NEED A NEW T. V. AERIAL 
BECAUSE OF SOMETHING NONE OF US CAN AVOID THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION 
BY TWO THOUSAND TWELVE ALL T. V. SERVICES IN THE U. K. WILL GO DIGITAL 
AND TO BE READY ALL YOU'LL PROBABLY NEED IS A FREEVIEW BOX OR A T. V. WITH A BUILT IN RECEIVER 
BUT NOT JUST AERIALS TRAIN THEIR STAFF SO CUSTOMERS BELIEVE SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
MOST PEOPLE SIMPLY DON'T NEED TO UPGRADE THEIR AERIAL 
BUT THE VERY CAREFULLY WORDED SCRIPT OUR RESEARCHER WAS TOLD TO USE 
SUGGESTS YOU WILL BE IN TROUBLE IF YOU DON'T 
WHEN NOT JUST AERIALS CALLED RICHARD BANGS 
THEY GAVE HIM THE IMPRESSION HIS AERIAL WOULD BE USELESS 
THE PERSON TOLD ME THAT WITHOUT A DIGITAL AERIAL 
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RECEIVE DIGITAL TELEVISION 
I'M RECEIVING PICTURES AND I CAN SEE NO REASON WHY THAT WAS IMPORTANT 
IT'S LUCKY RICHARD WAS SO SWITCHED ON 
BECAUSE NOT JUST AERIALS STAFF CAN BE VERY PERSUASIVE 
THEY ARE GIVEN PAGES OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT TO SAY IF PEOPLE ASK AWKWARD QUESTIONS 
AND SOME OF IT IS COMPLETELY UNTRUE ESPECIALLY THIS BIT AT THE TOP 
IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE BENEFITS OF DIGITAL TELEVISION 
YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE YOUR EXISTING T. V. AERIAL UPGRADED 
RUBBISH 
WE SHOWED OUR EVIDENCE TO DIGITAL U. K. THE ORGANISATION MANAGING THE COUNTRY'S SWITCHOVER 
THEY'RE ANGRY THAT A COMPANY IS BEING SO MISLEADING 
I'VE SEEN THE SCRIPT THAT THIS COMPANY IS USING TO COLD CALL CUSTOMERS 
THEY SEEM TO BE IMPLYING THAT YOU NEED A NEW AERIAL TO RECEIVE DIGITAL T. V. 
THAT'S NOT THE CASE THEY ARE ALSO SUGGESTING 
THAT SOMEHOW THE GOVERNMENT IS REQUIRING PEOPLE TO GET NEW AERIALS 
THAT AGAIN IS NOT THE CASE ANY COMPANY USING THESE PRACTICES 
IS CONNING THE PUBLIC AND WE CONDEMN THAT 
WE ASKED DAVID REYNOLDS TO COMMENT ON HIS LATEST WHEEZE BUT AGAIN HE WOULDN'T ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS 
SO WE WENT TO HIS H. Q. TO PUT THEM TO HIM IN PERSON 
IS DAVID REYNOLDS HERE PLEASE 
DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS 
I BET HE'S GOT A BIG CAR 
HE'S NOT IN THE OFFICE THIS AFTERNOON 
DAVID REYNOLDS MUST'VE BEEN OFF SOMEWHERE IN HIS BIG CAR AND NOBODY AT THE COMPANY WOULD TALK TO US 
UNTIL THEY'D SPOKEN TO THEIR LAWYERS AND EVEN WHEN THEY HAD THEY HAD NOTHING TO SAY 
CAN YOU TELL ME WHY NOT JUST AERIALS IS SELLING AERIALS TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T NEED THEM 
SORRY SHE'S JUST ADVISED ME THAT I DO NOT SPEAK TO YOU 
YOU'RE NOT TO SAY ANYTHING 
NO SORRY BUT IF YOU GO THROUGH THE LAWYERS THEY WILL BE PLEASED TO HELP YOU 
DID YOU SEE THE LAST ITEM WE DID ON WATCHDOG SORRY I'VE GOT TO GO IN 
HAVE A NICE FRIDAY AFTERNOON 
SORRY TO HAVE RUINED IT FOR YOU SLIGHTLY 
IT'S VERY VERY STRANGE ISN'T IT 
A MAN SO KEEN ON SELLING PEOPLE THINGS TO DO WITH TELEVISIONS DOESN'T WANT TO APPEAR ON TELEVISION 
IT'S A SHAME THAT HE DOESN'T ENCOURAGE HIS STAFF TO TELL THE TRUTH 
RATHER THAN MISLEADING CUSTOMERS SO THEY CAN TAKE MONEY OFF THEM 
WE'VE HEARD NOTHING FROM DAVID REYNOLDS SINCE THEN 
IT'S FAIR TO SAY WE'LL BE KEEPING AN EYE ON HIM AND HIS VARIOUS BUSINESSES 
LAST YEAR WE DID A TEST TO SEE HOW LONG SOME COMPANIES CAN KEEP YOU HANGING ON THE PHONE 
BEFORE YOU GET THROUGH TO A REAL PERSON WE HAD SOME HORRENDOUS DELAYS 
ON ONE OCCASION WELL OVER AN HOUR WITH BRITISH GAS 
BUT ALL THE COMPANIES INSISTED THEIR PERFORMANCE WOULD GET BETTER 
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WERE RIGHT 
WE'VE DONE THAT TEST AGAIN RINGING THE SAME COMPANIES 
SKY VIRGIN MEDIA TALK TALK ORANGE AND BRITISH GAS 
WE RANG EACH OF THEM ONE HUNDRED TIMES AT VARIOUS TIMES OF THE DAY AND MOST OF THEM ANSWERED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY 
ESPECIALLY SKY AND VIRGIN MEDIA BOTH OF WHOM AVERAGED AROUND TEN SECONDS TO GET THROUGH NOT BAD 
NO PRETTY GOOD BRITISH GAS STILL SOMETIMES TOOK A LITTLE LONGER 
BUT EVEN THEY ANSWERED TWO THIRDS OF OUR CALLS IN UNDER FIVE MINUTES 
OUR LONGEST WAIT WAS JUST ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN MINUTES 
NOT PERFECT BUT A MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT ON HOW THEY DID LAST YEAR 
SO WELL DONE ALL THOSE COMPANIES 
WE LIKE PASSING ON GOOD NEWS ON WATCHDOG SO HERE'S A BIT MORE 
OVER THIS SERIES ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND OF YOU HAVE CONTACTED WATCHDOG 
AS A RESULT WE'VE INVESTIGATED EVERYTHING FROM HIGH STREET BANKS 
TO THE INLAND REVENUE LOSING YOUR DETAILS 
WE'VE EVEN HAD SOME FAMILIAR FACES HELPING US OUT 
STOP EXPLOITING OUR FANS AND GIVE THEM THEIR TICKETS OR THEIR MONEY BACK 
OR WE'RE GONNA COME AND GET YOU 
YES YES 
SCARY AND IT WORKED 
THE TICKET COMPANY THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HAS NOW BEEN WOUND UP BY THE GOVERNMENT 
AND THERE HAVE BEEN DRAMATIC RESULTS ON OTHER STORIES TOO 
LIKE THOSE ROLLAWAY VAUXHALL SIGNUMS AND VECTRAS 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ARE BEING RECALLED 
AND FORD IS NOW TACKLING THE FAULT SOME FOCUSES HAVE WITH THEIR INSTRUMENT CLUSTER 
WE'RE USED TO COMPANIES TELLING US THEY'LL CLEAN UP THEIR ACT 
BUT RARELY DO THEY DO IT AS LITERALLY AS ONE FAST FOOD GIANT 
WHOSE RESTAURANTS SINCE WE LAST DROPPED IN 
HAVE GOT FINGER LICKING BETTER 
IN DECEMBER WE TESTED THE CLEANLINESS OF THE U. K.'S FIVE BIGGEST FAST FOOD CHAINS 
WE WERE LOOKING FOR BACTERIA AND WHEN A LAB ANALYSED OUR OUR SAMPLES 
WE FOUND PLENTY ESPECIALLY IN K. F. C. 
A CLEANING CLOTH FROM ONE OF THEIR BRANCHES IN BIRMINGHAM 
HAD LEVELS OF BACTERIA MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED TIMES THE ACCEPTABLE LEVEL 
IT ALSO HAD SOMETHING YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT TO FIND NEAR THE DINNER TABLE E. COLI 
THEY MAY AS WELL WIPE THE TABLE WITH A TOILET BRUSH 
IN FACT I HAVE TESTED TOILET SEATS AND TOILET LIDS AND FOUND MUCH CLEANER RESULTS 
K. F. C. TOLD US THEY'D BE RETRAINING STAFF AT ALL THEIR SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY BRANCHES 
SO WE WENT BACK TO SEE IF THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND IT HAS 
THIS TIME WE FOUND THE BACTERIA LEVELS WERE WELL WITHIN ACCEPTABLE LIMITS 
AND THOSE GROTTY CLOTHS WELL AT THE BRANCHES WE WENT TO THEY DON'T USE THEM ANY MORE 
THEY'VE SWITCHED TO PAPER TOWELS 
THESE RESULTS ARE ENCOURAGING BECAUSE IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE 
RESTAURANTS HAVE TAKEN ON BOARD THE COMMENTS FROM THE WATCHDOG REPORT 
SOME OF THE RESULTS WERE VERY CLEAN AND A FEW OF THEM WERE SPOTLESS WHICH INDICATES THAT 
THEY MUST BE USING A SANITISER TOGETHER WITH PAPER TOWEL SO THAT'S REALLY GOOD PRACTICE 
AND THERE WAS SWIFT ACTION FROM ANOTHER BIG NAME SAMSUNG 
AFTER WE REVEALED THAT THANKS TO A FAULT THE FRIDGE THAT LOOKED COOL ON THE OUTSIDE 
MOST DEFINITELY WASN'T ALWAYS COOL ON THE INSIDE 
WE NOTICED THAT THE TEMPERATURE HAD GONE UP RIGHT UP AND THE FOOD WAS STARTING TO SPOIL 
IN FACT AN EXPERT TOLD US THAT R. S. TWENTY ONE FRIDGES WITH THIS FAULT COULD BE NO COOLER THAN THE BOOT OF YOUR CAR 
THIS FRIDGE IS NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE 
IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN PUT ON THE MARKET 
BUT AFTER OUR INVESTIGATION SAMSUNG EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON THE R. S. TWENTY ONE 
SO THAT ANY DEVELOPING THIS FAULT WITHIN FIVE YEARS WILL BE FIXED FREE OF CHARGE 
AND THAT HAS SAVED DOZENS OF FRIDGE OWNERS LIKE MARILYN CREWE HUNDREDS OF POUNDS 
I RANG THE NUMBER THAT THEY GAVE OUT ON WATCHDOG 
THEY'VE EXTENDED MY WARRANTY THEY'VE GOT ENGINEERS OUT WHO FIXED IT STRAIGHT AWAY 
I'M DELIGHTED BECAUSE THAT FRIDGE WAS ABOUT TO END UP ON THE LOCAL DUMP 
EVEN IF COMPANIES DON'T IMMEDIATELY SEEM TO BE LISTENING 
SOME DO EVENTUALLY TAKE NOTICE OF WHAT YOU TELL THEM 
TAKE B. T. MANY OF YOU WERE FURIOUS THAT YOU'D PAID AN EXTRA QUARTERLY CHARGE 
IF YOU CHOSE NOT TO PAY YOUR BILL BY DIRECT DEBIT 
I DON'T WANT TO BE DICTATED TO ON HOW I PAY MY BILLS 
AS LONG AS I PAY THEM AND THEY GET THEIR MONEY 
THAT'S IT 
IT SEEMED B. T. WOULDN'T BUDGE 
BUT FROM MID TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THEY'LL BE INTRODUCING A NEW SERVICE B. T. BASIC 
FOR PEOPLE ON BENEFITS AND LOW INCOMES INCLUDING MANY PENSIONERS 
IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO PAY BY DIRECT DEBIT THERE WILL BE NO EXTRA CHARGE 
WHEN WATCHDOG CALLS COMPANIES REALLY DO LISTEN 
AND IT'S THANKS TO YOU THAT WE KNOW WHICH ONES TO GO AFTER 
SO TO ALL THOSE BIG NAMES WE KNOW WHO ARE LISTENING 
WE MAY BE TAKING A BREAK BUT WE HAVEN'T GONE AWAY 
NOPE WE HAVEN'T GONE AWAY MOST CERTAINLY NOT 
KEEP YOUR E. MAILS COMING WE'LL BE READING THEM OVER THE SUMMER 
ENERGY COMPANIES ARE IN THE NEWS AGAIN TODAY 
THERE'S SPECULATION PRICES WILL GO UP AGAIN 
BUT WHAT ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE 
FOR ONE BIG NAME HERE IS SOME VERY BAD NEWS INDEED 
IN THE ENERGY BUSINESS COMPETITION IS TOUGH 
THE BIG NAMES ALL WANT TO COME OUT ON TOP 
AND NONE OF THEM WANTS THE REPUTATION FOR BEING THE WORST 
THAT RATHER DUBIOUS HONOUR USED TO BELONG TO 
BRITISH GAS OR AT LEAST IT DID IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS 
BUT IT SEEMS THERE'S A NEW CONTENDER 
NPOWER BRITAIN'S FOURTH BIGGEST ENERGY SUPPLIER WITH SIXTY EIGHT MILLION CUSTOMERS 
BUT AS WE REVEALED IN MARCH RATHER SLOW OFF THE MARK WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR BILLS 
YOU WERE TELLING US THEY COULDN'T DO THE SIMPLEST OF SUMS 
SINCE THEN WE'VE BEEN OVERWHELMED WITH PEOPLE TELLING US THEIR NPOWER BILLS ARE WRONG 
OVER THE LAST TWO MONTHS WE'VE HAD MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY COMPLAINTS 
MORE THAN TWICE AS MANY AS THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR 
WHEN EIGHTY NINE YEAR OLD BERNARD JONES RECEIVED EXTREMELY HIGH BILLS HIS SISTER LOOKED INTO IT 
WHEN HE GOT THE BILL FOR NINE HUNDRED 
HE SAID TO ME I'VE PAID THAT IN THE PAST FOR A WHOLE YEAR 
IF THAT'S ONE QUARTER I CAN'T DO IT 
BEATRICE HAS WORKED OUT THAT NPOWER HAS BEEN CHARGING BERNARD AT THE WRONG RATE FOR THE LAST YEAR 
SHE HAS TOLD NPOWER THIS A NUMBER OF TIMES BUT THEY JUST WON'T LISTEN 
AND NOW BECAUSE HE'S REFUSED TO PAY FOR THEIR MISTAKE THEY HAVE CALLED IN THE DEBT COLLECTORS 
THE HUMILIATION THE INSULT AS WELL AS THE ANXIETY 
JUST SEEMS SO UNFAIR BECAUSE IT WAS DEALING 
WITH AN ELDERLY PERSON WHO DOES NOT HAVE THE ENERGY ANY MORE TO PURSUE AND PURSUE AND PURSUE AND PURSUE 
GARY NORTHOLT ALSO HAD PROBLEMS WITH NPOWER AND HE IS NOT EVEN THEIR CUSTOMER 
HIS FATHER WAS BUT HE DIED IN SEPTEMBER 
WHEN THE FINAL BILL ARRIVED IT WAS FOR EIGHTY SIX 
I WROTE IT A CHEQUE AND SENT IT OFF AND THOUGHT NOTHING MORE ABOUT IT 
BUT NPOWER HAD GOT CONFUSED 
THEY SENT ANOTHER FINAL BILL THIS TIME FOR NEARLY THREE HUNDRED 
AND THEN THEY SENT ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND EACH TIME IT FOR WAS FOR A DIFFERENT AMOUNT 
AS FAR AS GARY WAS CONCERNED HE HAD SETTLED THE ACCOUNT SO HE TOLD THEM HE WAS NOT GOING TO PAY 
THEIR RESPONSE AGAIN THE DEBT COLLECTORS 
I THINK NPOWER HAVE BEEN VERY INCONSIDERATE 
IT'S JUST SAD FOR THE FAMILY AND ALL OF US 
IT MAKES YOU FEEL SICK INSIDE 
THAT THEY ARE KEEPING ON AND ON ABOUT OWING MONEY 
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NO BILL TO PAY 
IT'S NOT ONLY US YOU'VE BEEN COMPLAINING TO ABOUT NPOWER 
WE WERE GIVEN AN EXCLUSIVE LOOK AT THE OFFICIAL FIGURES FROM ENERGYWATCH AND THERE IS NO DOUBT 
ABOUT THE COMPANY THEY SAY IS MILES BEHIND EVERYONE ELSE 
WE NOW HAVE A NEW CHAMPION 
AS THE WORST ENERGY SUPPLY IN BRITAIN IT'S NPOWER 
I WAS AMAZED THAT ANY COMPANY COULD BE WORSE THAN BRITISH GAS AT THEIR ACCOUNTS AND BILLING SYSTEM 
YOU HAVE A COMPLETE FAILURE 
OF COMPLAINT HANDLING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE 
ACCORDING TO ENERGYWATCH THE COMPANY CURRENTLY BEST IS SCOTTISH AND SOUTHERN ENERGY 
THEY SAY NPOWER MUST DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE 
NPOWER HAVE TO FACE UP TO THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM AND FACE UP 
TO THE FACT THAT THEY GET IT WRONG EVERYWHERE 
GET AN ACTION PLAN THAT WILL TACKLE THIS FROM THE ROOT CAUSE 
UP TO THE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE AND THEN COMMIT PUBLICLY 
COMMIT ON WATCHDOG TO SAY WE WILL BE THE BEST IN THE MARKET 
OR AT LEAST AROUND THE AVERAGE BY LATER THIS YEAR 
THE MOST COMPLAINED ABOUT ENERGY COMPANY IS A TITLE NOBODY WANTS 
BUT IF THEY WANT TO LOSE THAT PARTICULAR ACCOLADE 
IT LOOKS AS IF NPOWER 
HAS A LONG WAY TO GO 
WE HOPED NPOWER MIGHT WANT TO COME IN UNFORTUNATELY NOT 
BUT THEY TOLD US THEY ARE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THEIR PERFORMANCE 
THEY'RE CONFIDENT THAT AS STAFF BECOME FAMILIAR 
WITH THEIR NEW BILLING SYSTEM THERE WILL BE AN IMPROVEMENT IN CUSTOMER SERVICE 
THEY WILL BE PUTTING RIGHT THE CASES IN OUR FILM AND OFFERING THEM A GOODWILL GESTURE AS AN APOLOGY 
BUT INTERESTINGLY THEY RECKON THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS IS DROPPING EVERY YEAR 
BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT WE OR ENERGYWATCH HAVE FOUND 
MODERN TECHNOLOGY CAN BE WONDERFUL PROVIDED YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF UNDERSTOOD 
IT SENDS YOU RED IN THE FACE TRYING TO SAY THE WORD BLUE 
IT COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE MOST BASIC OF WORDS 
IMPRESSIONIST RORY BREMNER TRIED VARIOUS VOICES BUT STILL COULDN'T ALWAYS GET IT TO WORK 
WED WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU 
ANOTHER COLOUR WED 
BLACK OH IT'S GOT THAT ONE 
WHY DOESN'T IT UNDERSTAND WED 
THE NINTENDO D. S. USES VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE 
IN SOME OF ITS GAMES BUT SINCE WE REVEALED IT CAN STRUGGLE WITH 
REGIONAL ACCENTS AND SOME WOMEN'S VOICES YOU HAVE SENT SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO MAKE YOURSELF UNDERSTOOD 
I KNOW I'VE GOT A SCOTTISH ACCENT BUT IT'S NOT STRONG 
MY SOLUTION IS TO SPEAK IN AN AMERICAN ACCENT IT JUST WORKS 
IF YOU CAN'T DO AN AMERICAN ACCENT HOLD YOUR NOSE 
BLUE SCISSORS 
SCISSORS 
IT WORKS IT UNDERSTANDS MY DOG HENRY BETTER THAN ME 
SAY ROCK 
ROCK YAY 
WELL DONE GOOD BOY 
VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE ISN'T JUST FOR GAMES 
IT IS IN ALL SORTS OF USEFUL GADGETS LIKE HANDS FREE DEVICES IN CARS 
IT SHOULD MAKE LIFE EASIER 
SO WHY DO SOME OF YOU SAY IT'S DRIVING YOU ROUND THE BEND 
JANE BOLLEN BOUGHT A NEW FORD FIESTA EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO 
IT HAS SOPHISTICATED VOICE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY SUPPOSED TO ALLOW HER TO CONTROL 
THE CAR'S ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM AND MAKE PHONE CALLS HANDS FREE JUST BY SPEAKING 
BUT SHE CAN'T GET IT TO WORK THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM DOESN'T PICK UP MY VOICE PROPERLY 
THE KIDS THINK IT IS HILARIOUS BUT I FIND IT FRUSTRATING 
HAVE THEY GIVEN YOU ANY ADVICE ON HOW TO MODIFY YOUR DELIVERY 
YEAH FORD TOLD ME I HAVE EITHER GOT TO SPEAK MORE CLEARLY 
OR LOWER MY VOICE TO SPEAK LIKE A MAN 
THEY SAID THAT YES 
I WENT FOR A SPIN WITH JANE 
TO SEE IF USING ALL THE RIGHT VOICE COMMANDS I'D HAVE ANY MORE LUCK 
PHONE OH TWO OH EIGHT 
OH TWO OH EIGHT CONTINUE 
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE CAR HAS NO PROBLEM WITH MY VOICE BUT IT STILL DIALS THE WRONG NUMBER 
DIAL NUMBER 
NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE WHAT NO 
NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
THAT WAS THE WATCHDOG NUMBER WE LIKE TO SORT OUT PROBLEMS BUT WE ARE NOT NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
THAT WAS EXTRAORDINARY 
NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE THAT'S DEFINITELY THE WRONG SHOW 
FORD SAY THEY ARE SORRY THEIR VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM HASN'T MET HELEN'S EXPECTATIONS 
BUT THEY INSIST THE MAJORITY OF CUSTOMERS ARE HAPPY AND BENEFIT 
FROM THE CONVENIENCE AND SAFETY IT PROVIDES 
THE TECHNOLOGY MEETS INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS 
BUT IT IS RELATIVELY COMPLEX SO IT DOES REQUIRE PRECISE OPERATION 
THEY PROMISED TO HELP HELEN WITH HERS AND ON OUR WEBSITE 
THERE ARE TIPS FOR ANYONE ELSE HAVING PROBLEMS 
NEXT A STORY THAT HAD A HUGE IMPACT WHEN WE LOOKED AT IT IN FEBRUARY 
THE SOFAS THAT LEFT SOME PEOPLE IN EXCRUCIATING PAIN 
WE ARE STILL BEING SENT PICTURES OF THE MYSTERIOUS RASH THAT 
FOR MANY BECAME AN UNBEARABLE INJURY NEEDING URGENT MEDICAL ATTENTION 
AND THE CAUSE 
LEATHER SOFAS LIKE THESE 
TONIGHT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE LEFT WITH AN AGONISING ITCH OR EVEN IN HOSPITAL 
AFTER SITTING ON THE SOFAS THEY BOUGHT FROM SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN THE BUSINESS 
THOSE SOFAS CONTAINED A NASTY SURPRISE FOR PEOPLE SITTING ON THEM A SURPRISE THAT NONE OF THEM 
COULD HAVE IMAGINED AND WHICH THEY WILL NEVER FORGET 
I FELL ASLEEP ON MY SOFA 
I WOKE UP A FEW HOURS LATER 
AND MY BACK WAS COVERED IN A BLISTERED RASH 
THE SOFAS TO BLAME WERE MADE BY ONE CHINESE MANUFACTURER LINKWISE 
MOST WERE SOLD THROUGH THREE RETAILERS 
ARGOS LAND OF LEATHER AND HIGH STREET CHAIN WALMSLEY'S 
NOT EVERYONE WHO SITS ON THEM GETS A REACTION BUT AFTER OUR REPORT IN FEBRUARY HUNDREDS OF YOU TOLD US 
YOU HAD HAD THE SAME TERRIBLE SYMPTOMS FROM THE SAME SOFAS 
FOR MOST OF YOU WHAT MADE THE AGONY EVEN WORSE WAS THAT YOU HAD NO IDEA 
WHAT WAS CAUSING IT UNTIL YOU SAW WATCHDOG 
DAVID BARRETT BOUGHT A NEW SUITE FROM ARGOS LAST FEBRUARY 
BY AUGUST HIS SKIN HAD STARTED TO REACT VIOLENTLY 
IT WAS PURE AGONY 
DAY IN DAY OUT CONSTANTLY 
THE SKIN WAS BREAKING DOWN AND RELEASING A LOT OF WATER 
IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE I WAS SLEEPING IN THE BATH 
IN RED HOT WATER JUST TO MAKE THE ITCHING STOP FOR AN HOUR 
DAVID'S CONDITION GOT SO BAD HE WAS ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL FOR THREE DAYS AND PUT ON AN ANTIBIOTIC DRIP 
EVEN THEN HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS CAUSING IT 
IT WASN'T UNTIL HIS PARENTS SAW WATCHDOG THAT HE REALISED 
IT WAS LIKE RELIEF 
FINALLY I HAVE THE ANSWER I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR 
ARGOS HAD RECALLED ALL THE SOFAS THEY THOUGHT WERE AFFECTED 
BUT DAVID'S WASN'T IN THOSE BATCHES 
SINCE THEN THEY HAVE RECALLED MORE AND THEY AGREED TO EXCHANGE DAVID'S 
FOR ONE THAT DOESN'T CAUSE HIM A PROBLEM 
DAVID WAS LUCKY HE GOT HIS SOFA FROM ARGOS 
IF HE HAD BOUGHT IT FROM WALMSLEY'S HE COULD STILL BE STUCK WITH IT 
WALMSLEY'S SOLD A MARCO SUITE TO SANDRA EDWARDS LAST YEAR 
SOON AFTER SHE CAME OUT IN A MYSTERIOUS RASH 
IT STARTED OFF AS A RED PATCH AND THEN AN ITCH 
AND THEN IT BLISTERED AND CRACKED 
IT WAS THROUGH THE NIGHT THROUGH THE DAY DURING WORK 
CONSTANTLY THERE WAKING YOU UP 
SHE HAD NO IDEA IT WAS THE SOFA CAUSING THE RASH UNTIL A RELATIVE SAW THE WATCHDOG REPORT 
DESPITE COMPLAINING TO WALMSLEY'S AND SENDING THEM A DOCTOR'S LETTER 
SHE IS STILL STUCK WITH THE SOFA AFTER NEARLY THREE MONTHS 
I CAN'T SIT ON IT I HAVE PAID MONEY FOR SOMETHING I CAN'T SIT ON 
I SAT ON A CAMP CHAIR FOR TWO AND A HALF MONTHS I JUST WANT RID OF IT 
NO ONE KNEW FOR SURE WHY THESE SOFAS WERE CAUSING RASHES 
THE MANUFACTURERS LINKWISE WERE EVEN STILL CLAIMING 
ANY SKIN PROBLEMS WERE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR SOFAS 
THAT LEFT ARGOS AND OTHERS TRYING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT 
THEY TESTED VARIOUS POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS INCLUDING CHEMICALS USED IN THE DYING PROCESS 
NONE OF THEM PROVIDED THE ANSWER 
BUT OUR EVIDENCE LED US TO BELIEVE THAT THE CHIEF SUSPECT WAS THIS 
AN INNOCENT LOOKING SACHET HIDDEN AWAY IN THE SOFAS 
SO WE SENT IT AWAY FOR TESTING AND IT TURNS OUT WE WERE RIGHT 
THE SACHETS CONTAIN A FUNGICIDE 
DESIGNED TO STOP MOULD GROWING WHILE THE SOFA IS IN STORAGE OR TRANSIT 
CONSULTANT DERMATOLOGIST DOCTOR SANDRA WINHOVEN WAS IN CHARGE OF THE TESTING OF OUR SACHET 
AFTER THE LAST WATCHDOG PROGRAMME 
YOU KINDLY PROVIDED SOME SAMPLES WHICH WERE SENT TO SWEDEN 
THEY WERE ANALYSED BY A TEAM THERE AND THEY FOUND THAT THEY CONTAINED 
DIMETHYL FUMARATE WHICH IS A FUNGICIDE 
DIMETHYL FUMARATE IS KNOWN TO CAUSE SKIN IRRITATION 
IT'S THOUGHT THAT WHEN THE SOFA GETS HOTTER FOR EXAMPLE WHEN SOMEONE 
SITS ON IT THE CHEMICAL IN THE SACHET VAPORISES 
IT CAN THEN GET THROUGH THE LEATHER INTO CLOTHING AND ONTO THE SKIN 
SANDRA'S CONDUCTED PATCH TESTING WITH THIS CHEMICAL ON PATIENTS AFFECTED BY THE SOFAS 
WE HAVE SO FAR TESTED EIGHT PATIENTS AND SEVEN OUT OF EIGHT TESTED POSITIVE 
WE ARE PRETTY CERTAIN THAT THE DIMETHYL FUMARATE IS THE CAUSE OF THE SOFA DERMATITIS OUTBREAK 
ARGOS'S OWN INVESTIGATIONS CONFIRM OUR FINDINGS 
LAWYER RICHARD LANGTON IS REPRESENTING MANY OF THE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THIS ISSUE 
WE'VE HAD OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NEW CLIENTS COME TO US 
WHO'VE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE FURNITURE 
WE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE OFTEN SUFFERED FOR MONTHS 
THEY'VE BEEN TO THE DOCTOR'S BUT DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG 
AS A RESULT OF SEEING THE WATCHDOG PROGRAMME A LOT OF PEOPLE GOT TREATMENT 
THE SACHET WE HAD TESTED CAME FROM INSIDE ONE OF THESE SOFAS THE MARCO SOLD AT WALMSLEY'S 
BACK IN FEBRUARY WE WERE SURPRISED THAT THEY WERE STILL SELLING MODELS 
THAT HAD BEEN LINKED WITH THESE REACTIONS 
WE THOUGHT AFTER OUR REPORT THEY'D STOP BUT NO 
UNBELIEVABLY THEY'RE STILL ON SALE SOMETIMES AT KNOCK DOWN PRICES 
I'M ASTONISHED THAT ANYONE IS STILL SELLING THE FURNITURE 
I DON'T THINK THIS FURNITURE SHOULD BE FOR SALE NOW UNLESS SOMEBODY IS 
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT THE FURNITURE IS FREE OF THE CHEMICAL 
THE LEGAL ACTION BEING LED BY RICHARD ON BEHALF OF THOSE THAT HAVE SUFFERED IS ALSO PROGRESSING FAST 
TODAY IN THE HIGH COURT NEARLY ONE THOUSAND VICTIMS OF THESE SOFAS 
LAUNCHED THE U. K.'S BIGGEST EVER CLASS ACTION OF ITS KIND 
SUING THE SHOPS WHERE THEY BOUGHT THEM FOR DAMAGES 
THERE STILL COULD BE HUNDREDS MORE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DON'T REALISE 
IT COULD BE THEIR SOFA CAUSING THAT RASH 
WELL INCREDIBLY THE MANUFACTURER LINKWISE STILL MAINTAINS THE PROBLEM IS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR PRODUCTS 
MEANWHILE ARGOS HAS REITERATED THAT THEY VERY QUICKLY WITHDREW POTENTIALLY AFFECTED SOFAS 
FROM SALE AND THEY'VE MADE IT CLEAR THEY NO LONGER SELL ANY SOFAS MADE BY LINKWISE 
LAND OF LEATHER HAVE TOLD US THEY DON'T EITHER 
WALMSLEY'S HAVE PLACED NO NEW ORDERS WITH LINKWISE FOR THE LAST TWO MONTHS 
THEIR POLICY WITH THE ONES THEY HAVE ALREADY SOLD IS TO OFFER AN EXCHANGE OR REFUND 
WHEN CUSTOMERS SEND A DOCTOR'S NOTE CONFIRMING THEY'VE HAD A REACTION 
AND THOUGH SANDRA EDWARDS IS ADAMANT THAT SHE SENT THIS 
THE COMPANY HAS NO RECORD OF RECEIVING IT 
BUT THEY WILL NOW TAKE AWAY HER SOFA AND REFUND THE COST 
WALMSLEY'S ALSO SAY THEY HAVE COMMISSIONED THEIR OWN TESTS 
INTO THE PROBLEM AND HAVEN'T YET REACHED A FINAL VIEW 
BOTH WALMSLEY'S AND ARGOS WHO HAVE DONE A DETAILED INVESTIGATION 
SAY THE CHEMICAL IN THOSE SACHETS WILL DETERIORATE OVER TIME 
SO THEY BELIEVE THE CHANCES OF FURTHER PROBLEMS ARE SLIM LET'S HOPE SO 
ARGOS HAS GIVEN US THE NUMBER FOR CUSTOMERS TO CALL 
YOU CAN FIND IT ON OUR WEBSITE BBCCO.UK SLASH WATCHDOG 
THAT WEB ADDRESS IS WHERE YOU CAN KEEP SENDING YOUR STORIES FOR US TO 
INVESTIGATE WHILE WE TAKE A BREAK OVER THE SUMMER BUT NOT A HOLIDAY 
YOU CAN CALL US OH TWO OH EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE ONE THOUSAND 
AT THE END OF THIS WEEK THAT LINE WILL CLOSE UNTIL WE ARE BACK ON AIR 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TEXTS 
MOST OF THEM ABOUT SATELLITE DIRECT 
THIS JUST ABOUT SUMS IT UP 
DAVE FROM FINCHLEY 
THEY WON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER 
WE WILL BE BACK IN THE AUTUMN 
WE'LL BE WORKING HARD 
OVER THE AUTUMN UNTIL THEN 
FROM ALL OF THE WATCHDOG TEAM 
HAVE A GREAT SUMMER 
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING GOODNIGHT
