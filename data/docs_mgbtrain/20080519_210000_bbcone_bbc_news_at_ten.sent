GUIDELINES ON EMBRYO RESEARCH AND 
ABORTION ABORTION M. P.'S HAVE VOTED TO GIVE SCIENTISTS 
THE RIGHT TO USE HYBRID EMBRYOS FOR 
MEDICAL RESEARCH 
THEY ARE ALSO CONSIDERING THE 
CREATION OF SO CALLED SAVIOUR 
SIBLINGS WHO CAN DONATE D. N. A. TO 
BROTHERS AND SISTERS 
USE OF 
EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS OFFERS UNIQUE 
OPPORTUNITIES TO INVESTIGATE 
FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS IN OUR BIOLOGY 
WE WILL HAVE THE LATEST ON THIS 
HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL SET OF 
PROPOSALS PROPOSALS ALSO TONIGHT 
IN CHINA THE NATION REMEMBERS 
THOSE WHO PERISHED IN THE 
EARTHQUAKE A WEEK AGO 
STALLED THE CHIEF INSTPECTOR OF 
SCHOOLS WARNS THAT STANDARDS IN 
ENGLAND ARE NOT IMPROVING AND THE 
DUCHESS OF YORK HITS BACK AT 
SUGGESTIONS THAT HER DAUGHTER MIGHT 
BE OVERWEIGHT 
ON B. B. C. LONDON ACCUSATIONS THE 
GOVERNMENT IS FAILING TO DELIVER ON 
ITS OLYMPIC BID PROMISE TO GET MORE 
YOUNGSTERS INTO SPORT 
THE TOWN HALL REGISTRAR REFUSING TO 
MARRY GAY COUPLES 
GOOD EVENING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
TWENTY YEARS PARLIAMENT IS LOOKING AT 
NEW GUIDELINES FOR EMBRYO RESEARCH 
AND ABORTION TONIGHT A PLAN TO BAN 
HUMAN AND HYBRID EMBRYOS WAS 
DEFEATED M. P.'S WERE DELIGHTED 
SAYING THAT THESE EMBRYOS MIGHT 
HELP TO CURE SOME SERIOUS DISEASES 
IN THE COMMONS TONIGHT WE HAVE THE 
CONCEPT OF SAVIOUR SIBLINGS WHO 
CAN DONATE D. N. A. TO BROTHERS AND 
SISTERS WHO ARE ILL WE WILL COME 
BACK TO THAT VOTE LATER HAS 
SCIENCE GONE TOO FAR TONIGHT M. P.'S 
DECIDED IT HADN'T IN THE FIRST OF 
A SERIES OF FREE VOTES WHICH WILL 
SET BOUNDARIES ON A RANGE OF 
ETHICAL ISSUES FROM EMBRYO 
RESEARCH TO ABORTION 
FIRST UP HYBRID WHICH SOME M. P.'S 
REGARD AS IMMORAL AND BAD SCIENCE 
THIS IS ETHICALLY WRONG AND ALMOST 
CERTAINLY MEDICALLY USELESS OR IF 
NOT USELESS THERE IS NO EVIDENCE 
AS YET TO SUBSTANTIATE IT 
OTHERS SAW THE HOPE OF FUTURE 
TREATMENTS 
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE TREATMENTS WILL REALLY DEVELOP EFFECTIVE 
TREATMENTS TO HOLD OFF MEANS THAT 
WE ACTUALLY TAKE A PRECAUTIONARY 
PRINCIPLE WHICH IN EFFECT WILL 
KILL ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO COULD 
POTENTIALLY BE SAVED 
THE AND IS TO THE RIGHT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX 
ULTIMATELY M. P.'S TRUSTED THE 
SCIENTISTS IT WAS DEFEATED NEARLY 
TWO TO ONE THESE ARE HYBRID EMBRYOS 
SMALLER THAN A PIN HEAD YET THEY 
HAVE PROMPTED THIS HUGE MORAL 
DEBATE THEY ARE NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE HUMAN WITH A 
TINY AMOUNT OF ANIMAL D. N. A. 
SCIENTISTS HAVE APPROVAL TO EXTRACT 
STEM CELLS FROM THEM TO STUDY 
DISEASE THE EMBRYOS WILL BE STUDY 
FOR FOURTEEN DAYS 
IT HAS THE SUPPORT OF HUNDREDS OF 
MEDICAL CHARITIES AMONG THEM THE 
BRITISH HEART FOUNDATION RESEARCH 
BODIES LIKE THE WELLCOM TRUST AND 
PATIENTS THEMSELVES SEVEN MEMBERS 
OF LIZ SHIPLEY'S FAMILY HAVE DIED 
FROM MOTOR NEURONE DESEE HER 
HEALTH IS SLOWLY WORSENING SHE IS 
PLEASED RESEARCH CONTINUES THERE THERE IS HOPE ONE DAY THERE WILL BE A 
TREATMENT AND A CURE NOT IN MY 
LIFETIME BUT HOPEFULLY IF MY 
CHILDREN ARE UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO 
HAVE M. N. D. HOPEFULLY IN THEIR 
LIFETIME THERE WILL BE A CURE 
AFTER APROVING HYBRID EMBRYOS THE 
NEXT SCIENTIFIC BOUNDARY M. P.'S HAD TO 
CONSIDER TONIGHT WAS THE CREATION 
OF SO CALLED SAVIOUR SIBLINGS THIS 
IS WHERE AN EMBRYO IS SELECTED TO 
BE A TISSUE MATCH FOR A SICK CHILD 
ONCE BORN THEIR UMBILICAL CHORD 
BLOOD IS COLLECTED AND CAN BE USED 
IN A TRANSPLANT JODIE FLETCHER IS 
A SAVIOUR SIBLING FOR HER BROTHER 
JOSHUA HER CHORD BLOOD IS ON 
STANDBY TO TREAT HIM IF HIS RARE 
BLOOD DISORDER WORSENS 
WE ARE NOT 
LIVING IN THE DARK AGE THIS IS THE 
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY YOU CAN'T KEEP 
MEDICAL SCIENCE FROM PROGRESSING 
BUT SOME M. P.'S SAID IT REDUCED 
CHILDREN TO COMMODITIES OR SPARE 
PARTS 
I SEE SO MANY DOWN SIDES TO PARTS THIS PROCESS WE ARE EMBARKING ON A 
NEW FIELD OF ETHICAL ACTIVITY 
WHICH IS THE CREATION OF HUMAN 
BEINGS SPECIFICALLY FOR THE GENETIC 
BENEFIT OF OTHERS 
TOMORROW THEY 
WILL THERE WILL BE A FREE VOTE ON 
ABORTION ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT 
SAYS THE TIME LIMIT SHOULD REMAIN 
AT TWENTY FOUR WEEKS MANY M. P.'S WILL PUSH FOR 
A REDUCTION ON THIS THE MOST 
DEVISIVE OF ALL ETHICAL ISSUES 
WE THINK THE SECOND VOTE IS THROUGH 
TONIGHT AT WESTMINSTER 
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US 
LITERALLY IN 
THE LAST FEW MOMENTS WE HAVE THE 
NEWS THAT M. P.'S HAVE REJECTED A BID 
TO LIMIT THE USE OF SAVIOUR 
SIBLINGS THAT WAS AN AMENDMENT PUT 
FORWARD BY THE SHADOW HEALTH 
SECRETARY THAT BID HAS BEEN TURNED 
DOWN BY M. P.'S HOWEVER THERE ARE 
STILL MORE VOTES TO GO ON THAT 
SUBJECT BEFORE THE CLOSE OF PLAY 
THIS EVENING BUT FOR NOW THAT HAS 
BEEN REJECTED BY M. P.'S 
LOOKING AHEAD TO TOMORROW AS 
FERGUS WAS SAYING THAT VOTE ON 
ABORTION AND THE TIME LIMIT HOW IS 
THAT LIKELY TO WORK 
TOMORROW WE 
WILL SEE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN TODAY 
BUT IN EVEN MORE SERIOUS TONES 
THERE HAS BEEN A VERY STRONGLY 
WORDED DEBATE AT WESTMINSTER TODAY 
BUT VERY CALM M. P.'S GRASPING THE 
SENSE OF IMPORTANCE OF THIS AND A 
VERY RARE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO 
VOTE ON ISSUES THAT REPRESENT A 
CLASH FOR WHAT 
SOME SEE 
AS THE 
SANCTITY OF LIFE AND SCIENCE ON 
THE 
OTHER HAND 
IT WILL BE 
THE 
FIRST TIME IN EIGHTEEN YEARS 
THAT M. P.'S HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE 
THEIR SAY ON ABORTION IT WILL BE 
FREE VOTE AND IT DOESN'T DIVIDE 
DOWN PARTY LINES THERE ARE PEOPLE 
ON 
ALL SIDES 
OF THE 
COMMONS CHAMBER 
THAT HAVE VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS THE 
ONE 
THING THEY 
DO HAVE IN COMMON IS 
AN AWARENESS 
OF 
JUST HOW 
IMPORTANT 
TOMORROW'S VOTE COULD BE 
SEARCH TEAMS IN CHINA LOOKING FOR 
SURVIVORS OF LAST WEEK'S EARTHQUAKE 
STOPPED BRIEFLY TODAY FOR A 
NATIONWIDE THREE MINUTE SILENCE IN 
MEMORY OF THE VICTIMS AT EXACTLY 
TWO POINT TWO EIGHT LOCAL TIME ONE WEEK AFTER 
THE EARTHQUAKE STRUCK THE COUNTRY 
CAME TO A STAND STILL 
SIRENS SOUND SIRENS SOUND 
THE NATIONWIDE TRIBUTE IN CHINA 
TODAY WELL THE RESCUE MISSION IS 
SLOWLY TURNING INTO A RECOVERY 
OPERATION BUT THERE ARE STILL 
GLIMMERS OF HOPE THE CHINESE MEDIA 
REPORTED THAT THREE MORE SURVIVORS 
WERE PULLED FROM THE RUBBLE TODAY 
INCLUDING A MAN IN HIS EIGHTIES 
OUR CHINA CORRESPONDENT HAS SPENT 
THE DAY IN BEICHUAN CLOSE TO THE 
EPICENTRE OF THE EARTHQUAKE 
UNDER THE REMAINS OF AN APARTMENT 
BUILDING RESCUERS CALL OUT INTO 
THE DARK 
THEY THINK THEY HAVE FOUND SOMEONE 
WHO IS STILL ALIVE 
A CROWD GATHERS THERE IS WORD THAT 
THE PERSON TRAPPED MAY BE A BUILDER 
A MAN IN HIS EARLY FORTIES 
SOLDIERS STANDBY WITH AN 
INTRAVENOUS DRIP SEVERAL HOUSE GO 
BY AND THEN AMBULANCE WORKERS 
QUIETLY PUT AWAY THEIR STRETCHER 
RESCUERS THOUGHT THEY WERE VERY 
CLOSE TO SAVING SOMEONE TRAPPED 
UNDERNEATH THE RUBBLE BUT THE 
SOLDIER THERE HAS JUST SAID HE'S NO 
LONGER SURE WHETHER ANYONE TRAPPED 
DOWN THERE IS STILL ALIVE 
BEICHUAN IS NOW TOWN OF THE DEAD 
THIS AFTERNOON AT TWO TWENTY EIGHT P. M. SOLDIERS 
AND RESCUERS STOOD STILL TO 
REMEMBER THE MOMENT THE EARTH SHOOK 
IN THIS TOWN 
EARLIER TODAY ONE MORE PERSON WAS 
FOUND ALIVE 
CHINESE STATE T. V. FILMED THE RESCUE 
OF A SIXTY ONE YEAR OLD WOMAN SHE HAD 
BEEN TRAPPED FOR ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR HOURS 
WE DON'T KNOW HER NAME BUT SHE MAY 
BE THE LAST SURVIVOR OF BEICHUAN 
IN RECENT DAYS OTHER SURVIVORS 
HAVE BEEN MAKING THEIR FINAL VISITS 
THIS WOMAN LOST FIVE MEMBERS OF HER 
FAMILY AND EVERYTHING THAT SHE 
OWNS OWNS 
WE HAVE NOTHING TO WEAR MY LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTER 
DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT FOOD SHE'S 
ONLY NINE MONTHS OLD 
SO CHINA'S 
BEGUN TO BUILD TEMPORARY HOMES FOR 
ITS NEW REFUGEES HERE IN A FIELD 
OUTSIDE BEICHUAN WORKERS PUT UP 
SHELTERS BUT WHAT YOU SEE HERE 
DOESN'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO WHAT 
THIS COUNTRY NEEDS 
THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE NOW LIVE IN AN INDOOR 
STADIUM THEY EVEN SLEEP IN THE 
BOXING RING IT WORKS FOR NOW BUT 
HERE'S THE QUESTION FOR THE FUTURE 
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH FIVE MILLION 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES 
IMPROVEMENTS IN PRIMARY AND 
SECONDARY EDUCATION IN ENGLAND HAVE 
STALLED ACCORDING TO THE CHIEF 
INSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS CHRISTINE 
GILBERT WARNED THAT A FIFTH OF ONE 
YEAR OLD PUPILS WERE UNABLE TO READ 
OR WRITE PROPERLY SHE HAS SET OUT 
PLANS TO CHANGE THE WAY SCHOOLS ARE 
INSPECTED SHE HAS WARNED THAT 
MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED 
FROM THE WOMAN WHO IS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR INSPECTING STANDARDS IN ENGLAND 
ENGLISH SCHOOLS IT IS NOT GOOD 
THAT PROGRESS HAS STALLED SHE'S 
ESPECIALLY WORRIED ABOUT ELEVEN YEAR 
OLDS 
WE SAW A STEADY IMPROVEMENT A REAL 
IMPROVEMENT AND STANDARDS HAVE 
STALLED IT ISN'T THAT PEOPLE 
AREN'T TRYING HARD ENOUGH PEOPLE 
TRY VERY HARD INDEED SCHOOLS TRY 
VERY HARD INDEED SOME OF THESE 
PROBLEMS ARE DEEP AND COMPLEX IT IT IS NOT JUST ENGLAND THE U. K. AS A 
WHOLE HAS SLIPPED DOWN 
INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE TABLES IN 
READING WE HAVE FALLEN FROM 
SEVENTH PLACE AMONG DEVELOPED 
COUNTRIES TO SEVENTEENTH BEHIND 
COUNTRIES LIKE POLAND THIS DESPITE 
SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN SPENDING 
UP FROM TWENTY SEVEN BILLION TEN YEARS AGO 
TO SIXTY FOUR BILLION LAST YEAR THAT IS 
MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH WHAT IS 
THE SOLUTION IT MIGHT LOOK 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS ONE TO ONE 
READING LESSONS FOR THE HARDCORE 
WHO STRUGGLE EXPENSIVE BUT 
TARGETING MONEY MAY BE BETTER THAN 
SPREADING IT THINLY 
INSPECTION IS 
A PART OF ADDRESSING THIS STUBBORN 
CORE THAT REMAIN YET TO FULLY 
BENEFIT FROM THE EXTRA INVESTMENT 
PUT IN WE ARE DOING ONE TO ONE 
TUITION NEW WAYS OF TEACHING 
ENGLISH AND MATHS WE HAVE HAD 
GREAT RESULTS FROM THE NEW 
PROGRAMMES 
INSPECTORS ARE TRYING PROGRAMMES THE SAME TARGETED APPROACH THEY 
GRADE SCHOOLS IN FOUR CATAGORIES 
BUT IN FUTURE THE BEST SCHOOLS WILL 
RECEIVE FEWER INSPECTIONS PERHAPS 
ONLY ONE IN SIX YEARS WHILE THE 
WORST SCHOOLS WILL GET MO MAYBE 
ONCE A YEAR AND POSSIBLY WITHOUT 
NOTICE THESE CHANGES MAY NOT BE 
POPULAR IN SCHOOLS BUT THEY 
REFLECT FRUSTRATION THAT HOW MUCH 
MUCH MONEY THE GOVERNMENT PUTS IN 
STANDARDS REMAIN LOW AMONG A 
SIGNIFICANT MINORITY 
A BRITISH SOLDIER HAS BEEN KILLED 
IN AN EXPLOSION WHILE ON A FOOT 
PATROL IN SOUTHERN AFGHANISTAN IT 
HAPPENED IN MUSTARD IN HELMAND 
PROVINCE THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE 
SAYS HIS NEXT OF KIN HAVE BEEN 
INFORMED NINETY SIX BRITISH SERVICE 
PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN KILLED IN 
AFGHANISTAN SINCE OPERATIONS BEGAN 
IN TWO THOUSAND ONE 
SOUTH AFRICAN POLICE ARE SENDING 
REINFORCEMENTS TO JOHANNESBURG TO 
TRY TO QUELL A TIDE OF VIOLENCE 
AGAINST IMMIGRANTS OFFICERS HAVE 
FOUGHT RUNNING BATTLES WITH YOUTHS 
IN THE CITY AND SURROUNDING AREAS 
ABOUT TWENTY TWO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED 
SINCE THE TROUBLE BEGAN A WEEK AGO 
YOU MAY FIND SOME OF THE IMAGES 
DISTRESSING IN THIS REPORT TENSION 
ON SOUTH AFRICA'S STREETS 
GUNSHOT GUNSHOT GUNSHOTS RING OUT IN THE DARK 
PITCH BLACK POLICE INCH THEIR WAY 
THROUGH THE NIGHT THIS IS PRIMROSE 
THE LATEST FLASH POINT IN A WEEK OF 
TROUBLES TONIGHT JUST AN HOUR AGO 
A MAN WAS SET ALIGHT RIGHT HERE 
YET THIS INFORMAL SETTLEMENT IN THE 
EAST OF THE CITY UP UNTIL RECENTLY 
WAS WHERE SOUTH AFRICANS AND 
FOREIGNERS LIVED SIDE BY SIDE IT 
IS A SIGN OF JUST HOW QUICKLY 
THINGS ARE SPIRALLING OUT OF 
CONTROL CONTROL PARTS OF JOHANNESBURG LOOKED MORE 
LIKE A WAR ZONE THAN THE ECONOMIC 
POWERHOUSE OF AFRICA CROWDS 
VENTING THEIR ANGER AGAINST 
FOREIGNERS THEY ACCUSE OF TAKING 
THEIR JOBS AT A TIME WHEN RISING 
FOOD PRICES AND POWER CUTS ARE 
RAISING THE TEMPERATURE IT IS NOT 
JUST THE THREE MILLION ZIMBABWEANS 
FROM ACROSS THE BORDER THAT HAVE 
BEEN ATTACKED BUT BUSINESSES OF 
ALL IMMIGRANTS ARE BEING TARGETED 
BY ARMED MOBS MORE THAN TWENTY PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN KILLED AND MORE INJURED 
IN VIOLENCE THIS MAN BADLY 
INJURED AFTER BEING SET ALIGHT 
HE'S BARELY ALIVE 
WE MUSTN'T ASSUME THAT HAVING A 
CONSTITUTION THAT DEALS WITH 
PREJUDICE MEANS THAT NATION THAT 
HAS BEEN SCHOOLED IN PREJUDICE FOR 
YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS SUDDENLY 
JUST GOING TO HAVE NO PREJUDICE 
WHATSOEVER WHATSOEVER SO THE NEATLY LAWN MOWNS OF 
CHURCHES AND POLICE STATIONS HAVE 
BEEN TURNED INTO REFUGEE CAMPS WE 
FOUND FIFTY SIX YEAR OLD FLORENCE LIMPING 
AND IN PAIN ATTACKED WITH A METAL 
BAR BY A GROUP OF YOUTHS LAST NIGHT 
SHE AND HER DAUGHTER SAY THIS 
COUNTRY THAT WAS ONCE A SAFE HAVEN 
IS NOW HELL 
I'M NOT HAPPY YOU CAN 
SEE MANY PEOPLE HAVE PROBLEMS NOT 
PEOPLE HAVE THE PROBLEM NOW I'M 
NOT HAPPY I IT IS A PROBLEM NOW 
DO YOU FEEL YOU WERE BETTER OFF IN 
CONGO THAN IN SOUTH AFRICA 
I WANT 
TO GO BACK 
THE VIOLENCE IS A HUGE 
EMBARRASSMENT FOR THE CONTINENT'S 
MOST PROSPEROUS NATION THE 
CITIZENS IN APARTHEID DAYS SOUGHT 
REFUGE ACROSS THE BORDER WHOM 
THEIR OWN PEOPLE ARE NOW TURNING 
AGAINST AGAINST STILL TO COME ON TONIGHT'S 
PROGRAMME PROGRAMME OUR CORRESPONDENT DEFIES BURMA'S 
REGIME TO REPORT UNDER COVER ON THE 
DEVASTATION CAUSED BY THE CYCLONE 
CRITICISED THE MEDIA FOR SAYING HER 
DAUGHTER IS OVERNIGHT SHE WAS ON 
TELEVISION TONIGHT HELPING FAMILY 
IN HULL WITH THEIR ISSUES ABOUT 
WEIGHT WEIGHT ON ONE SIDE OF THIS ROW THE DUCHESS 
OF YORK A PROGRAMME TO PROMOTE A 
TEENAGE DAUGHTER TO PROTECT ON THE 
OTHER SIDE ALISON PEARSON WITH COPY 
TO WRITE AND PAPERS TO SELL THE 
DUCHESS HAS APPEARED IN A 
DOCUMENTARY IN WHICH SHE SPENDS 
TIME WITH FAMILY TO HELP THEM 
SORT THEIR WEIGHT OUT AFTER MEDIA 
COMMENTS ABOUT HER DAUGHTER SHE HAS 
COME OUT FIGHTING 
SHE ACCUSES THE DUCHESS'S DAUGHTER 
OF COMBINING HER MOTHER'S EXCESSES 
WITH HER DAUGHTER'S FATHER'S 
FIGURE FIGURE SHE'S A HEALTHY SIZE HEAD 
THE MAIL SAYS ALISON PEARSON HAS 
NOT RECEIVED A DIRECT APPROACH BY 
THE DUCHESS BUT MANY CALLS WERE 
MADE TO THE COLUMNISTS THE PAPER 
SAYS 
PRINCESS BEATRICE IS NOT IN THE 
LIMELIGHT AS MUCH AS OTHER ROYALS 
SHOULD THAT AND THE FACT SHE'S ONLY 
NINETEEN CHANGE WHERE THE LINE OF PRIVACY 
AND COMMENT IS DRAWN 
IT IS 
POSSIBLE 
THERE SHOULD BE 
WRITTEN IN 
THAT GIVES ROYAL 
CHANCE TO 
LIVE 
A PRIVATE LIFE UNTIL 
CHANCE TO LIVE A PRIVATE LIFE UNTIL THEY 
ARE TWENTY ONE BUT AS 
A VERY 
PRIVILEGED LIFE AND 
PEOPLE 
ARE NOSEY 
AND CURIOUS 
BY 
TAKING PART 
IN THE 
DOCUMENTARY 
THE DUCHESS OF YORK WILL HAVE KNOWN 
THAT SHE WILL AGAIN 
FACE PRESS 
SCRUTINY BUT WHEN IT COMES TO HER 
DAUGHTER 
SHE BELIEVES 
THE MEDIA 
NEED TO ACT MORE RESPONSIBLY 
MINISTERS HAVE APPROVED PLANS TO 
IMPROVE PUBLIC PERCEPTION AND 
UNDERSTANDING OF THE ARMED SERVICES 
AMONG THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PLANS 
FOR A NATIONAL ARMED FORCES DAY A 
NEW LAW MAKING IT AN OFFENCE TO 
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ANYONE WEARING 
A MILITARY UNIFORM AND PARADES FOR 
TROOPS RETURNING FROM COMBAT 
IN BURMA AID AGENCIES HAVE 
CAUTIOUSLY WELCOMED THE MILITARY 
GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO ALLOW SOME 
FOREIGN HELPERS INTO THE COUNTRY TO 
HELP SURVIVORS OF THE CYCLONE 
THREE DAYS OF NATIONAL MOURNING 
WILL BEGIN TOMORROW FOR THE EIGHTY THOUSAND 
VICTIMS OF THE CYCLONE FOREIGN 
REPORTERS HAVE BEEN BANNED FROM 
BURM MARKS BUT OUR CORRESPONDENT 
MANAGED TO ENTER THE COUNTRY AND 
SPENT THE LAST FEW DAYS IN THE 
RANGOON AREA TWENTY MINUTES OUTSIDE 
RANGOON A CHECKPOINT ON THE ROAD 
FOR A TENSE HOUR WE WAITED WE WERE 
IN BURMA ILLEGALLY 
OUR DRIVER WAS TAKEN AWAY TO BE 
QUESTIONED ALL ROUTES OUT HAD BEEN 
SEALED OFF TO STOP FOREIGNERS 
GETTING INTO THE CYCLONE HIT 
IRRAWADDY DELTA 
AID WORKERS ARE BEING KEPT IN 
RANGOON EVEN THOUGH AN ESTIMATED 
TWO POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE ARE IN NEED 
OUTSIDE BURMA'S MILITARY RULERS 
ARE CONCERNED THAT ADMITTING THEIR 
OWN RELIEF EFFORTS ARE INADEQUATE 
COULD LAOSEN THEIR HOLD ON POWER 
DESPITE THE SECURITY CLAMPDOWN WE 
MANAGED TO GET OUT TO ONE VILLAGE 
PEOPLE WERE SITTING BY RUINED HOMES 
WAITDING FOR AID MEMBERS OF THE 
BURMESE RED CROSS HAD JUST ARRIVED 
TWO WEEKS AFTER THE CYCLONE HIT 
UNSENSORED INFORMATION IS GETTING 
TO BURMA'S PEOPLE WE BOUGHT THIS 
D. V. D. ON A RANGOON STREET CORNER 
SHOT BY ANONYMOUS CITIZENS THE 
SCENES ARE OF DEVASTATION AND 
PEOPLE WITH LITTLE AID FUELLING 
THE DISCOULDN'T TENT ALREADY FELT 
HERE THESE SURVIVORS WERE HUDDLED 
IN A MONASTERY 
THE WATER WAS ABOVE 
OUR HEADS WHEN THE STORM CAME 
OUT OF THREE HUNDRED HOUSES ONLY ONE HUNDRED SURVIVED 
HE TO CLING ON TO A TREE TO SURVIVE 
BUT ONLY THE BOLD SPEAK OUT 
RISKING ARREST THAT MAN URGED THE 
FOREIGN WARSHIPS WAITING OFF THE 
COAST TO BRING IN THE SUPPLIES 
REGARDLESS OF THE MILITARY'S 
GOVERNMENT WISHES 
REGARDLESS OF THE MILITARY'S GOVERNMENT WISHES 
THEY WANT TO 
GOVERNMENT WISHES THEY WANT TO HELP ME THEY MUST COME TO OUR 
COUNTRY BY INDONESIAN LAW BY FORCE 
HELP ME THEY MUST COME TO OUR COUNTRY BY INDONESIAN LAW BY FORCE 
ORDINARY PEOPLE FROM RANGOON ARE 
TRAVELLING TO THE STRICKEN AREAS TO 
DO WHAT LITTLE THEY CAN TO HELP 
BUT BURMA'S RULERS SEEM MORE 
CONCERN BAD SAVING THEMSELVES THAN 
THEIR PEOPLE 
GLASGOW RANGERS ENSURED THAT THE 
SCOTTISH PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE RACE 
IS TO GO TO THE WIRE WITH A THREE TO ZERO WIN 
OVER SAINT MIRREN BUT THE BALANCE OF 
POWER IS WITH CELTIC A KRIS BOYD 
STRIKE AND DOUBLE MEANS THAT THE 
OLD FIRM RIVALS HEAD OUT OF THE 
SEASON LEVEL ON POINTS 
CELTIC ARE FOUR GOALS BETTER OFF 
CRICKET AND THE FIRST TEST BETWEEN 
ENGLAND AND NEW ZEALAND AT LORD'S 
HAS ENDED IN A DRAW THE TOURISTS 
WERE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY NINE TO SIX AT THE CLOSE 
THE BATSMAN CAME OFF THE BAT LIGHT 
THEY WERE LIFTED TO SAFETY BY JACOB 
ORAM ORAM THE QUEEN HAS FORMERLY OPENED THE 
CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW IT HAS TAKEN 
THREE WEEKS TO BUILD MORE THAN 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED TO 
VISIT BY THE END END OF THE WEEK 
AMONG THE DESIGNS IS ONE INSPIRED 
BY THE FORMER BEATLE GEORGE HARASS 
ON ON HARRISON IT IS A PLACE OF 
PERFECT BLOOMS SPECTACULAR GARDENS 
AND FAMOUS FACES VISITING HERE 
ANOTHER BEATLE GEORGE HARRISON 
IT IS A NICE GESTURE FOR GEORGE HE 
LOVED THE GARDEN THE PATH FROM 
LIVERPOOL TO WHERE HE ENDED UP IT 
IS BEAUTIFUL 
GREEN ROOMS GREEN WALLS CHELSEA 
IS A 
S. D. 
BED WERE NEW IDEAS ARE 
SEWN SEWN IT IS GREAT TO SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO 
THIS IS NOT A BIG STAND 
AMONG THE 
IDEAS THIS YEAR IS RESCUING OUR 
FRONT GARDENS FROM THE BLIGHT OF 
OFF STREET MARKING AND WHEELIE BINS 
WHEELIE BINS DOMINATED THE 
LANDSCAPE WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO 
USE THEM BUT TO HIDE THEM AWAY 
AND THIS 
PROPER PLANTING WE WANT 
TO MAKE THE FRONTS OF HOUSES LOOK 
ATTRACTIVE AGAIN PARKING 
IT HAS PARKING GRAVEL HERE AND THAT HELPS TO LET 
THROUGH THE WATER 
AND WITH CHEL 
SEA MIXING KIDS AND WITH CHELSEA 
MIXING KIDS AND PERFECTION IS NEVER 
GOING TO BE EASY 
ARE YOU NERVOUS 
A LITTLE BUT IT 
IS A VERY STATEMENT LATING SPACE 
FOR THEM 
AND THIS IS A THREE THOUSAND CHICKEN COUP 
AND AN ANTI WAR GARDEN 
CHELSEA WANTS TO INFLUENCE THE 
NATION'S GARDENERS 
THIS GUARDEN IS ALL ABOUT HOW WE 
MAY HAVE TO ADAPT TO A HOTTER AND 
WETTER CLIMATE 
IT'S ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN JUST POSH 
FROCKS AND PRETTY FLOWERS THIS IS 
ABOUT HOW EVERYTHING MAY HAVE TO 
CHANGE IN THE GARDEN IN THE FUTURE 
A LOOK AT THE MAIN NEWS M. P.'S HAVE 
VOTED TO ALLOW THE CREATION OF 
HYBRID THAT IS TO SAY HUMAN ANIMAL 
EMBRYOS FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH IN 
THE PAST FEW MINUTES AS WE 
REPORTED THEY HAVE DEFEATED AN 
ATTEMPT TO STOP SCIENTISTS CREATING 
SAVIOUR SIBLINGS THAT IS TO SAY 
CHILDREN WHO CAN DONATE LIFE SAVING 
D. N. A. TO BROTHERS OR SISTERS 
THERE IS MORE INTERNATIONAL NEWS ON 
THE B. B. C. NEWS CHANNEL 
GOOD NIGHT GOOD
