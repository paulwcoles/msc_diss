OUR FINAL EIGHT ARE ALL DESPERATELY 
SEEKING WEST END FAME 
BUT HAVE THEY DONE ENOUGH 
TO PUSH THINGS FORWARD AT THIS 
CRUCIAL HALFWAY STAGE 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S BEEN 
HAPPENING IN NANCY AND OLIVER LAND 
BECAUSE SOMETIMES I GO OUT BY 
MYSELF AND I LOOK ACROSS THE 
TONIGHT FOR ME DICTION WAS THE 
PROBLEM NANCY TELLS A STORY AND 
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT STORY THAT THAT LACKED PUNCH LIKE WERE YOU MARKING 
IT NOT GIVING IT A FULL 
PERFORMANCE 
I'M A BIT OF A PER PERFORMANCE FICTIONIST AND IT WAS NOWHERE NEAR 
MY HIGH STANDARD 
I THINK YOUR BEST PERFORMANCE SO 
FAR IN THE COMPETITION 
YOU ACTED VERY WELL BUT I WANT TO 
SEE SOMETHING WARMER FROM YOU MORE 
PLAYFUL 
IT'S GOT TO BE ABOUT REAL PLAYFUL AND ACTING YOU GAVE US THE BEST 
PERFORMANCE 
YOU'D BETTER STOP PERFORMANCE YOU'VE GOT VERY DISTINCTIVE 
QUALITY DON'T LOSE IT TRYING TO 
PLEASE EVERYBODY L. SENSE A LITTLE INHIBITION 
WHAT I'M SEEING FROM INHIBITION THE OTHER GIRLS IS GIVING THEM THE 
CRITIQUE AND FIXING IT YOU'RE NOT 
FIXING IT YET 
I LET MYSELF DOWN 
TONIGHT SO IF I'M IN THE SING OFF 
I WON'T BE SURPRISED TO BE HONEST IF YOU CONTINUE TO DO THAT YOU 
COULD BE ON THE WEST END 
YOU SANG 
WONDERFULLY AND ACTED WITH REAL 
INTELLIGENCE INTELLIGENCE LOVE TO SET ME FREE 
THAT WAS A GREAT SONG OF SURVIVAL 
AND I THINK THE BEST YET FROM YOU 
YOU'RE A FIGHTER AND YOUR NANCY IS 
BLOSSOMING 
THE SPIRITS RISE AND THAT DANCE 
YOU'VE LOST SOME OF YOUR FIGHT I I FOUND THAT SLIGHTLY CHEESY IT WAS 
BRAVE BUT YOU MADE SOME OF THE 
WRONG CHOICES THERE WITH THE LYRICS 
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU COULD HOLD AN 
AUDIENCE IN A WEST END THEATRE 
STAGE 
I'M WANTING TO BE HERE AND STAGE I WANT TO PROVE THAT THEY'RE 
MISSING SOMETHING THAT'S IN ME 
SANTA CLAUS WHAT'S THAT 
BEARING IN MIND THE SINGING AND 
WHAT I SAW TODAY IT'S ALEX 
THANK YOU SO MUCH 
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN GONE 
YOU HAD BAGS OF NANCY ALTITUDE 
JUST BE CAREFUL IT DOESN'T GET TOO 
SHOUTY IN PARTS 
IT WAS A GREAT 
GREAT PERFORMANCE YOU'RE THE 
YOUNGEST CONTESTANT AND I THINK 
YOU'VE MADE THE FURTHEST JOURNEY 
I'M SO GLAD THAT HE THINKS I'VE 
IMPROVED L. FEEL LIKE NIM NOT THE 
GIRL I WAS WHEN I ENTERED THIS 
COMPETITION 
DON'T MAKE ME 
YOU'RE TURNING INTO A SUCH 
BRILLIANT ACTRESS 
YOU ARE FEARLESS 
AND THAT'S A QUALITY I LIKE TO SEE 
IN MY LEADING LADY YOU'RE DESTINED 
FOR THE WEST END 
THE COMPETITION'S GETTING TOUGH 
JOHN BARROWMAN AND BARRY HUMPHRIES 
ARE WE ME NOW HOW DEMANDING IS 
PLAYING EIGHT SHOS A WEEK WEEK

BEEN IN FIVE SEPARATE PRODUCTIONS 
OF OLIVER IT'S A TOUGH ONE NOT 
TOO MANY PARTIES AFTER THE SHOW 
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN OFF I'M VERY 
PROUD TO SAY JOHN THIS WEEK YOU WERE A LITTLE 
I DON'T KNOW SURPRISED OR 
DISTRESSED TO FIND OUT SOME HOW 
UNFIT SOME OF OUR NANCYS WRXT 
I WAS 
BECAUSE I MADE A SURPRISE VISIT AND 
I POPPED IN AND FOUND THINGS IN 
THEIR FRIDGE LIKE MONTH OLD LETTUCE 
BASICALLY WHAT IT WAS I FELT THEY 
WEREN'T LIVING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE 
AND IN ORDER TO DO EIGHT SHOWS A 
WEEK YOU HAVE TO NOT ONLY BE TREAT 
YOURSELF LIKE AN ATHLETE YOU HAVE 
TO EAT WELL AND KEEP YOURSELF 
PHYSICALLY FIT IT DOESN'T MEAN 
GETTING SKINNY IT MEANS KEEPING 
YOURSELF IN SHAPE

NANCYS YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT 
YOU NEED FIVE PORTIONS OF FRUIT A 
DAY 
THAT'S RIGHT 
SO TO HELP YOU

TECHNICALLY AND THAT THEN AFFECTED 
OTHER PEOPLE UP THE BOAT 
JODIE WAS MAYBE NOT THE FITTEST ONE 
THERE AND OVER A LONG DISTANCE RACE

MIGHT START TO TELL 
RACHEL'S VERY COMPETITIVE AND AT 
ONE POINT ONE HAD TO SAY SHH LET 
ME TELL THEM WHAT TO DO
