WITH THREE SURPRISING STORIES CLOSE 
TO HOME 
HELLO AND WELCOME I'M MATTHEW 
WRIGHT AND 
HELLO AND WELCOME I'M MATTHEW 
WRIGHT AND YOU'RE WATCHING THE LAST 
IN THE CURRENT SERIES OF 
HERE'S WHAT'S COMING UP ON OUR 
FINAL SHOW 
THE SUPERCHEAP SUPER STRENGTH 
LAGER THAT'S KILLING VULNERABLE 
DRINKERS DRINKERS YOU DO NOT DRINK THAT BECAUSE YOU 
LIKE THE TASTE OF IT 
YOU DRINK IT BECAUSE OF THE VOLUME FOUR MONTHS ON 
HOW THE GYPSIES OF SLOUGH 
ARE STILL PICKING UP THE PIECES 
AFTER A HIGH PROFILE POLICE RAID 
YOU WAKE UP WITH THE BANGING AND 
PEOPLE SCREAMING DON'T MOVE 
STUFF LIKE THAT 
IT WAS REALLY TERRIFYING 
AND THE CHILDHOOD OBSESSION THAT'S 
SAVING LONDON'S HERITAGE 
I GET OLD TAT SYNDROME ALL THE TIME 
WHAT DO YOU WANT THAT OLD CRAP 
FOR 
AS A NATION WE LOVE A DRINK 
THOUGH SADLY OF COURSE 
NOT ALWAYS IN MODERATION 
BINGE DRINKING IS NEVER FAR 
FROM THE HEADLINES 
BUT THE LATEST CONCERN IS THE SALE 
OF SUPER STRENGTH LAGER AND CIDER 
AT SUPER CHEAP PRICES TO VULNERABLE 
DRINKERS DRINKERS NOW A CAMPAIGN IS CAMPAIGN IS 
UNDER WAY DEMANDING REFORM AND 
SURPRISINGLY SURPRISINGLY IT'S THOSE AT THE SHARP END THE 
DRINKERS THEMSELVES 
WHO ARE CALLING FOR AN END TO THE 
SALE OF CHEAP BOOZE 
I WENT TO FIND OUT MORE 
SUPER STRENGTH LAGER AND CIDER 
YOU PROBABLY ASSOCIATE IT WITH 
TEENAGERS WHO CAN'T AFFORD ANYTHING 
ELSE STREET DRINKERS 
OR RAGING ALCOHOLICS 
AND ONE TASTE AND YOU CAN PROBABLY 
TELL WHY 
NOW AS THE GOVERNMENT MEETS WITH 
THE DRINKS MANUFACTURERS TO DISCUSS 
CURBING OUR BINGE DRINKING CULTURE 
SOME OF THOSE WHO 
HIGH STRENGTH LOW COST ALCOHOL 
ARE HITTING BACK AT THE 
TRAMP JUICE TRAMP JUICE THEY SAY IS KILLING THEM 
LIVING ON THE STREETS 
WHY DO I DRINK BEER 
I DON'T DRINK BEER 
IN ONE LONDON HOSTEL 
MANAGEMENT SAY THAT TWENTY FOUR OUT OF THIRTY 
DEATHS IN TWO YEARS WERE DIRECTLY 
CAUSED BY SUPER STRENGTH 
THEY SAY THE REASON THEY ARE DYING 
IS THAT ALCOHOLICS ARE BUYING NINE PER CENT 
PROOF LAGER 
AND SEVENTY FIVE PROOF CIDER AT ROCK BOTTOM 
PRICES PRICES AND THEN SPENDING ALL DAY 
BINGE DRINKING IT IN LARGE VOLUMES 
BEFORE MOVING TO A HOSTEL 
KEVIN LIVED FOR SIX YEARS IN A 
CHURCHYARD IN SOUTH LONDON 
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS DESTITUTE HE 
COULD STILL AFFORD 
TO DRINK TEN CANS OF SUPER STRENGTH 
LAGER EVERY DAY 
YOU DO NOT DRINK IT BECAUSE YOU 
LIKE THE TASTE OF IT 
IT BECAUSE OF THE VOLUME 
AS SOON AS YOU SEE THE VOLUME 
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GOING TO DRINK IT 
EVERYONE'S GUNNA GO GLUG GLUG GLUG 
DOCTOR CHRIS ALFORD IS A SPECIALIST ON 
ALCOHOL AND WHAT IT DOES TO YOU 
AND HE AGREED TO MONITOR MY 
PROGRESS AS I SAMPLED 
A FEW TINS OF SUPER STRENGTH 
EVEN THOUGH I'M USED TO A TIPPLE 
AFTER TEN YEARS IN FLEET STREET 
I WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT THE 
EFFECT OF HIGH ALCOHOL LAGER 
WOULD BE ON ME 
WE'RE GONNA WATCH THESE 
FIRST HE HAD TO TEST MY REACTIONS 
WHEN SOBER 
O. K. 
LET'S GIVE IT A GO 
GOOD LUCK O. K. ONE OF THE SKILLS HERE IS TO WORK 
OUT HOW YOU PRIORITISE YOUR TASKS 
IN ORDER TO GET THE BEST SCORE 
OVERALL 
SOBER MY SCORE IS NINE HUNDRED TWENTY 
I'M PROUD TO SAY QUITE HIGH 
RARRR 
GOLD MEDAL PERFORMANCE RARRR LATER I'LL SEE HOW MUCH MY 
REACTIONS HAVE CHANGED 
AFTER THREE MORE TINNIES 
NOW IN THE INTERESTS OF SCIENCE AND 
INSIDE OUT 
CHEERS CHEERS THE REASON ALCOHOLICS CHOOSE THESE 
BRANDS OF SUPER STRENGTH 
IS THAT THEY ARE EASILY AVAILABLE 
ALL DAY AT JUST OVER A POUND A CAN 
IT'S HARD TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION 
WHEN THEY ARE VERY CLEVERLY 
MARKETED THROUGH WHAT'S KNOWN AS 
POINT OF SALE PROMOTION 
IT'S MULTI MILLION POUND INDUSTRY 
THEY'RE SOLD IN LARGE AMOUNTS IN 
YOUR FACE MOSTLY IN LOCAL SHOPS 
NUMEROUS CASE WORKERS WHO WORK WITH 
CLIENTS WHO ARE OFTEN ALCOHOL 
DEPENDANT SKINT AND VERY ILL 
HAVE TOLD US OF DISTURBING TREND 
IN LONDON 
SHOP OWNERS ARE GIVING CREDIT TO 
VULNERABLE DRINKERS WHO THEN HAVE 
TO PAY BACK WHAT THEY'VE BORROWED 
OUT OF THEIR HOUSING OR INCAPACITY 
BENEFIT WITH INTEREST 
IT'S LOCAL IT'S INFORMAL AND KIND 
OF INVISIBLE 
BECAUSE IT IT'S NOT SOMETHING 
THAT'S GENERALLY KNOWN 
I'VE HEARD OF A SITUATION WHERE 
SOMEBODY WANTED ONE CAN 
AND WAS SLOWLY PERSUADED TO PERHAPS 
HAVE FOUR WITH CREDIT ARRANGEMENT 
BUT THAT RESIDENT WOULD 
BE PAYING BACK MORE 
THAN THE COST OF THE LAGER 
IF YOU'RE SHORT OF CASH 
AND YOU WANT DRINK HOW EASY 
IS IT TO GET A DRINK HARD 
YOU GO BEGGING 
WELL I TRY 
HOW DO YOU GET THE CASH 
I TRY GETTING IT ON THE CHEAP 
YOU DON'T JUST WALK IN 
AND GET IT ON THE CHEAP 
YOU'VE GOT TO SHOW SOME MONEY 
WHILE WE WERE FILMING 
DEREK WHO IS A HOSTEL MANAGER FROM 
THAMES REACH 
TOLD US HE WAS AWARE OF A CASE 
WHERE A CLIENT SAID 
HE HAD BEEN RECEIVING CREDIT 
FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS 
IT'S COME TO LIGHT THIS WEEK THAT 
ONE OF OUR SERVICE USERS 
TO OBTAIN CREDIT FROM 
AN OFF LICENCE NEAR TO US 
HE DECIDED TO VISIT THE SHOP TO 
CHALLENGE THEM 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE AWARE 
THERE IS PROJECT NEAR HERE 
THAT WORKS WITH OLDER 
VULNERABLE PEOPLE 
THE MANAGER SEEMED CONFUSED 
AND ADMITTED SAID HE KNEW DRINKER 
IN QUESTION 
AND SAID THAT HE WOULD SPEAK 
TO HIS BROTHER WHO OWNS THE STORE 
ABOUT ENDING THE PRACTICE 
INSIDE OUT HAS ALSO BEEN TOLD OF AT 
LEAST TEN OTHER SHOPS IN FOUR 
DIFFERENT BOROUGHS 
WHICH HAVE ENGAGED 
IN THIS CREDIT PRACTICE 
THEY'RE PART OF THE COMMUNITY 
SO WE'D LIKE THEM TO SEE THEIR 
CUSTOMERS AS PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT 
BE EXPLOITED 
THING'S LIKE DOUBLE VISION 
DOCTOR CHRIS ALFORD IS CLEAR 
ABOUT WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES 
OF PROLONGED HARD DRINKING ARE 
WE KNOW SOME OF THE HEALTH COSTS 
YOUR LIVER CAN GRADUALLY PACK UP IF 
YOU BECOME A CHRONIC DRINKER 
DRINKING MANY OF THESE CANS PER DAY 
AND THE WORST CASE 
THAT CAN BE FATAL 
IT CAN ALSO LEAD TO DEPRESSION AND 
SOCIAL PROBLEMS 
NOW IT'S MY TASK TO SINK SEVERAL 
CANS 
TO SEE HOW I'LL 
REACT TO THE SUPER STRENGTH 
NOW I'VE HAD FOUR TIMES YOUR DAILY 
RECOMMENDED INTAKE OF ALCOHOL 
IT'S TIME TO TAKE THE TEST AGAIN 
IT'S KICKING IN 
THERE'S ANOTHER CAN TO COME 
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE IT THROUGH 
I DO EVENTUALLY HAVE TO GO HOME 
I STILL THINK I'M GOING TO DO O. K. IN 
THE NEXT TEST 
O. K. IT'S ALL YOURS 
RIGHT RIGHT 
THIS IS NOW A STRUGGLE O. K. 
AFTER THIRTY FIVE CANS OF SUPER STRENGTH 
MY SCORE IS FORTY PER CENT LOWER 
THAN WHEN I WAS SOBER 
NOT BAD L. DIDN'T WANT TO SAY TOO MUCH 
THERE 
I WOKE UP AT THREE O'CLOCK THIS 
MORNING WITH THE THOUGHT 
WHERE AM I I DON'T REMEMBER 
GETTING HOME FROM THE TEST CENTRE 
I DON'T REMEMBER BEING AT HOME 
OR GOING TO BED OR TAKING MY 
CLOTHES OFF OR PRETTY ANYTHING ELSE 
ABOUT LAST NIGHT 
ALL I KNOW ABOUT TODAY IS I'M 
NURSING THE HANGOVER FROM HELL 
THE SOCIAL SIDE EFFECTS OF 
SUPER STRENGTH WERE OF SUCH CONCERN 
TO WESTMINSTER AND EALING COUNCILS 
THAT THEY PERSUADED LARGE 
SUPERMARKETS TO REMOVE IT 
FROM THE SHELVES 
THEY FEEL THAT STREET DRINKING 
SCHOOLS WILL NO LONGER CONGREGATE 
WHEN THESE DRINKS AREN'T AVAILABLE 
ARE YOU SO SURE IT'S HIGH STRENGTH 
LAGER THAT'S THE PROBLEM NOT 
ALCOHOL ACROSS THE BOARD 
BASICALLY BECAUSE OF THE CANS 
THAT ARE LEFT LYING AROUND 
ALL OVER THE PLACE 
I THINK THOSE PARTICULAR 
INDIVIDUALS SOME OF THE MOST 
VULNERABLE IN OUR SOCIETY 
HAVE GOT TO A POINT IN THEIR LIVES 
AND IN THEIR DRINKING 
WHERE THEY HAVE THE NEED 
TO DRINK STRONG LAGER 
TO HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THEM 
IN THE COMMONS 
AN EARLY DAY MOTION TABLED BY 
BATTERSEA M. P. MARTIN LINTON 
IS CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT 
TO CURB THE SALE OF 
SUPER STRENGTH LAGERS 
BY TAXING THEM AT A HIGHER RATE IT 
HAS ATTRACTED ALL PARTY SUPPORT 
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT ANY 
SELF RESPECTING BREWER 
WOULD STAY AWAY FROM SUPER STRENGTH 
LAGERS LAGERS IT GIVES THE WHOLE DRINKS 
INDUSTRY A BAD NAME 
THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS THAT WORK IS 
GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES 
TO TACKLE OUR BINGE DRINKING 
CULTURE THROUGH MEETINGS WITH THE 
DRINKS INDUSTRY 
AND THROUGH REPORT TO BE 
PUBLISHED LATER THIS YEAR 
THEY TOLD US 
THE BREWING TRADE IS SELF REGULATED 
BY THE PORTMAN GROUP 
WHO DEAL WITH ANY COMPLAINTS 
ABOUT THE MARKETING OF ALCOHOL 
THERE'S NO REASON REALLY TO SUPPOSE 
THAT THESE DRINKS DON'T HAVE A 
LEGITIMATE MARKET 
AMONGST RESPONSIBLE ADULT DRINKERS 
YES THEY ARE ALSO CONSUMED BY 
PEOPLE WITH ALCOHOL DEPENDENCY 
PROBLEMS 
THAT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN 
THAT THEY ARE IRRESPONSIBLE DRINKS 
THAT ARE IRRESPONSIBLY MARKETED 
BUT JEREMY SWAIN FROM THAMES REACH 
INSISTS IT'S THE COMPANIES MAKING 
SUPER STRENGTH THAT ARE TO BLAME 
SITTING IN HOSTEL NOW ARE FOUR 
PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE DYING IN 
THE NEXT FEW MONTHS 
BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT OF 
SUPER STRENGTH LAGER 
ON THEIR LIVES AND THEIR BODIES 
UNTIL WE CAN SEE A WAY OF PRICING 
THESE CANS OFF HE MARKET 
WE'RE GOING TO SEE THIS LEVEL OF 
DESTRUCTION AND DEVASTATION 
EVEN THOUGH THE BREWERS INSIST 
THAT SUPER STRENGTH 
IS MORE WIDELY CONSUMED 
IT IS THE STREET DRINKERS 
THEMSELVES WHO ARE MOST AT RISK 
AND WHO ARE MOST VOCAL ABOUT HAVING 
THE DRINKS REMOVED FROM SALE 
I WOULD LIKE 'EM TO BE BANNED 
TOTAL TOTAL IT'D DEFINITELY NOT APPEN 
BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH MONEY TO 
BE MADE 
THEY DON'T CARE WHAT DAMAGE THESE 
PRODUCTS ARE DOING 
TO THESE INDIVIDUALS 
AS LONG AS THE POUNDS ARE COMING IN STILL TO COME 
ONE NIGHT AFTER THE DEMOLITION 
I CRAWLED OVER 
AND HEAVED THIS OUT OF THE RUBBLE 
IT WAS GOING TO BE BURNED ON HUGE FIRE THE NEXT DAY 
THE ALADDIN'S CAVE HOARDING 
LONDON'S PAST 
ONE OF THE MANY MIGRANTS 
FROM EASTERN EUROPE 
TO HAVE ARRIVED ON ARE SHORES 
ARE THE GYPSIES OF ROMANIA 
THEY'VE HAD A FAIRLY LOW PROFILE 
UNTIL MASSIVE POLICE RAID IN 
SLOUGH EARLIER THIS YEAR 
FOLLOWING ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD 
TRAFFICKING AND RUNNING FAGIN STYLE 
GANGS GANGS FOUR MONTHS ON LITTLE HAS COME OF 
THESE CLAIMS 
BUT IT'S SERIOUSLY DAMAGED RACE 
RELATIONS IN THIS CORNER OF ENGLAND 
TESSA DUNLOP HAS THE STORY 
THE STREETS OF SLOUGH ARE A 
SNAPSHOT OF MODERN BRITAIN 
IT HAS ONE OF THE MOST MULTI ETHNIC 
POPULATIONS IN THE COUNTRY 
SECOND ONLY TO LONDON 
IN ITS DIVERSITY 
A LONG WAY FROM THEIR HOMELAND 
SOME ROMANIAN GYPSIES HAVE DECIDED 
TO SETTLE IN SLOUGH 
HARDLY A PART OF ENGLAND RENOWNED 
FOR ITS CHOCOLATE BOX QUALITIES 
SO WHY HAVE THEY COME HERE 
I THINK I MIGHT KNOW WHY 
I'VE SPENT LOT OF TIME 
IN ROMANIA AND IT'S COUNTRY 
I'VE GROWN TO LOVE 
BUT I'VE NEVER MET ANY ROMANIAN 
WHO HAS ANYTHING DECENT TO SAY 
ABOUT THEIR GYPSY MINORITY 
SO NOW THEY'VE MOVED HERE 
WHAT DO THE ROMA GET UP TO 
ON A DAILY BASIS 
AND WHAT KIND OF IMPRESSION ARE 
THEY MAKING 
IF YOU SEE A GANG OF THEM 
TWENTY TO THIRTY OF THEM 
IT'S INTIMIDATORY ISN'T IT I DON'T THINK YOU COULD TRUST THEM 
VIEWS LIKE THESE ARE PRESUMABLY 
WHAT THE GYPSIES WERE TRYING TO GET 
WHEN THEY CAME HERE 
BUT THE ROMA OF CHALVEY IN SLOUGH 
CLEARLY HAVE AN IMAGE PROBLEM POLICE POLICE MOST OF US KNEW LITTLE 
UNTIL OPERATION CADDY HIT THE NEWS 
ON JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH THIS YEAR 
IT WAS NO LOW PROFILE POLICE RAID 
INSTEAD INVOLVING FOUR HUNDRED OFFICERS MANY 
IN FULL RIOT GEAR 
ARMED WITH BATTERING RAMS TARGETING 
SEVENTEEN HOMES INCLUDING THIS ONE 
BELONGING TO MARIUS MICLESCU'S 
FAMILY FAMILY WHERE DESPITE THE DOOR BEING 
SMASHED DOWN AT FIVE A M. NO ONE WAS 
ARRESTED 
THEY REALLY WENT FOR IT 
THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY THIS WAS A VERY SHOCKING MOMENT FOR ME WAKING UP WITH THE BANGING 
PEOPLE SCREAMING DON'T MOVE 
THEY DIDN'T EXPLAIN WHAT WAS GOING 
ON THEY PUT HANDCUFFS ON 
THEY PUT HANDCUFFS ON YOU YES YES YOU'RE A SCHOOLKID YES YES IN THE GLARE OF THE CAMERAS 
TEN CHILDREN WERE 
TAKEN 
TEN CHILDREN WERE FORCIBLY TAKEN AWAY 
GENERATING LURID HEADLINES 
ABOUT CHILD TRAFFICKING 
AND FAGIN GANGSTERS 
CONFIRMING THE WORST POSSIBLE 
STEREOTYPES OF GYPSIES AMONG 
THEIR NEIGHBOURS IN CHALVEY 
BUT IT WASN'T QUITE LIKE THAT 
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY NINE OF THE TEN KIDS 
TAKEN BY POLICE 
WERE RETURNED TO THE COMMUNITY 
AND THERE WAS NEVER ANY SUGGESTION 
OF PROSTITUTION OR DRUG DEALING 
A NUMBER OF ARRESTS WERE MADE FOR 
SUSPECTED BENEFIT FRAUD 
AND STOLEN GOODS BUT MANY OF THE 
ROMA FEE 
L. THE RAID WAS OUT OF ALL 
PROPORTION WITH THE RELATIVELY 
MINOR NATURE OF SUCH CRIMES 
THEY FEEL VICTIMISED AND ARE TOO 
SCARED TO SPEAK OUT 
MARIUS IS AN EXCEPTION 
I AM NOT SAYING THAT GYPSIES 
ARE PERFECT 
YOU DO GET SOME BAD GYPSIES 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU DO GET 
SOME WHITE PEOPLE THAT DO DIFFERENT 
STUFF AS WELL 
SOME BLACK PEOPLE 
AND SOME ASIAN PEOPLE 
THAT DOESN'T MEAN 
EVERYBODY DOES IT 
MARIUS'S MUM ELENA KEEPS AN OPEN 
HOUSE HOUSE AT ANY GIVEN TIME OF DAY HER 
KITCHEN IS FULL OF A HAPPILY 
CHAOTIC EXTENDED FAMILY 
AND EVEN ADOPTED STRANGERS LIKE ME 
HOW MANY CHILDREN WHAT YOU HAD 
FIVE CHILDREN 
THAT FOR US IS MANY CHILDREN 
IS THAT NORMAL 
NORMAL FIVE SIX SEVEN TEN 
TEN 
YES I LIKE TOO MUCH CHILDREN TEN EVERY GYPSY LIKE TOO MUCH CHILDREN 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN YOUR 
CULTURE YES CULTURE YES THE MICLESCUS ARRIVED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WHEN 
THEY WERE GRANTED ASYLUM 
SINCE THEN AGAINST MANY 
PRECONCEPTIONS ALL THEIR KIDS HAVE 
GONE TO SCHOOL 
GRANDCHILDREN DEL PIERO AND NORRIS 
WILL ALSO GO WHEN THEY'RE OLD 
ENOUGH 
HE'S ONLY THREE 
SO HE DOESN'T SPEAK ROMANIAN 
AND HE DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH 
SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO HIM AT ALL COS 
HE SPEAKS ROMA THE GYPSY LANGUAGE 
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPEAK GYPSY 
LANGUAGE LANGUAGE NO NO 
YOU KNOW IF ALL YOU'VE HEARD OF 
THESE PEOPLE THE ROMA POPULATION 
OR ALL YOU'VE SEEN ARE THOSE 
PICTURES IN THE NEWS 
THE POLICE RAID AND THE CHILD 
TRAFFICKING ACCUSATIONS 
THEN I THINK THERE'S TENDENCY TO 
THINK NO SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE 
SOMETHING MUST BE GOING ON 
BUT I'VE COME HERE AND 
I'VE GOT TO KNOW THESE GUYS 
OVER COUPLE OF MONTHS 
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH 
I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH LOVE IN A 
FAMILY 
UNLIKE THE MICLESCUS PUICO BLANDU 
IS A RECENT ARRIVAL 
SINCE JOINING THE E. U. IN TWO THOUSAND SIX 
ROMANIAN NATIONALS ARE ALLOWED TO 
ENTER THE COUNTRY 
BUT UNLIKE THE POLES 
FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE 
NO AUTOMATIC RIGHT TO WORK 
THIS LEAVES MIGRANTS LIKE PUICO IN 
A BIT OF A PREDICAMENT 
SO NO SURPRISE THAT AT THE END 
OF OUR FIRST MEETING IN CHALVEY 
SHE WAS ASKING ME FOR MONEY 
I ASKED HER ABOUT THE NEGATIVE 
IMAGE THE GYPSIES HAVE 
OF BEING BEGGARS AND THIEVES AND 
USING THEIR CHILDREN FOR DISHONEST 
PURPOSES WAS THIS FAIR 
IT'S NOT FAIR BECAUSE IF WE WOULD 
BE GIVEN WORK 
WE WOULDN'T DO SUCH THINGS BUT IF 
THEY DON'T GIVE US ANY WORK 
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE WE 
WOULD STARVE IN THE STREET 
SO DOES THAT MEAN 
IF YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY 
YOU SOMETIMES HAVE TO DO THINGS 
THAT AREN'T HONEST 
YES YES 
BUT DO YOU DO ANYTHING THAT ISN'T 
HONEST HONEST I'M HONEST IF I HAVE WORK AND AM 
GETTING MONEY 
BUT IF NOT THEN WHAT DO I DO GRIN 
AND BEAR IT L. GO AND BEG 
BACK AT THE MICLESCUS' 
A SPONTANEOUS PARTY HAS 
BROKEN OUT IN THE KITCHEN 
NICOLAI IS A SNAPPY MOVER AND A 
SHARP DRESSER 
HE ALSO DRIVES A MUCH LOVED FOUR X. FOUR 
WHICH GOT ME WONDERING 
HOW NOW FINANCIALLY 
DO YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY A CAR 
DO YOU HAVE WORK 
WHAT'S THE SYSTEM 
AND IN THE SUMMER DO YOU WORK IN 
AGRICULTURE AND YOU PICK FRUIT YES 
WHICH LEAVES ME LITTLE THE WISER 
I'M STILL NOT SURE WHERE NICOLAI 
GETS ALL HIS MONEY FROM 
CURRENTLY ON BENEFITS TWICE A WEEK 
HE'S SENT BY THE JOB CENTRE TO 
LEARN IT SKILLS AT THIS CLASS 
I WAS IMPRESSED BY HIS 
DETERMINATION TO MAKE THE MOST 
OF THE OPPORTUNITY 
HE DIDN'T HAVE THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE 
THAT HE WOULD LIKED TO HAVE 
HE WAS A BIT RELUCTANT AS TO 
WHETHER HE'D BE ABLE TO COPE OR NOT 
BUT HE REALLY WANTED TO LEARN 
AND HE'S WORKING HARD FOR THAT 
TO ME NICOLAI AND HIS FAMILY SEEM 
LIKE WARM AND DECENT PEOPLE 
TRY AS I MIGHT 
I CAN'T SQUARE THE HEADLINES 
GENERATED BY THE POLICE RAID IN 
JANUARY WITH THE GYPSIES I HAVE MET 
LAST SUNDAY THE GYPSY COMMUNITY 
CELEBRATED THEIR EASTER 
AND I WAS INVITED 
EVERYONE DRESSED IN THEIR FINEST 
THE MUSIC WAS LOUD A WHOLE LAMB 
WAS READIED FOR THE FEAST 
EVEN THE SUN CAME OUT AFTER 
THE STORM AND A LITTLE BIT OF 
ROMANIA WAS CREATED RIGHT HERE 
IN THE UNLIKELY SETTING OF CHALVEY 
GYPSIES DEFINITELY GET A BAD PRESS 
AND THAT'S THE REASON I CAME 
TO SLOUGH TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS 
GOING ON BEHIND THE STORIES 
THESE ARE SOME OF THE FAMILIES 
I'VE MET AND I'VE RECEIVED 
FROM THEM GREAT HOSPITALITY 
AND WE'VE BECOME FRIENDS 
IT SURPRISES ME THAT IN BRITAIN 
WE'RE STILL PREPARED TO GIVE 
LAZY LABELS TO PEOPLE WHO 
WE KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT 
AS KIDS MOST OF US GO THROUGH 
A PHASE OF COLLECTING STUFF 
BE IT STICKERS STAMPS OR FOOTBALL 
CARDS FOR ME IT WAS RECORDS 
BUT AT THE AGE OF THREE 
CHARLES BROOKING STARTED TO COLLECT 
KNOBS KNOCKERS AND DOOR HANDLES 
AND NOW FIFTY YEARS ON HE'S AMASSED A 
WEALTH OF ARCHITECTURAL ARTEFACTS 
IT'S CONSIDERED A NATIONAL TREASURE 
BUT THERE'S ONE BIG PROBLEM 
THE CLOCK IS TICKING CHARLES MUST 
FIND HIS COLLECTION A NEW HOME 
OR IT'S IN DANGER OF ENDING UP ON 
THE SCRAP HEAP 
CAN HE SALVAGE IT 
BIG GEORGE WENT TO FIND OUT 
WELCOME TO THE SURREAL WORLD OF AN 
ENGLISH ECCENTRIC CHARLES BROOKING 
WHETHER IT'S VICTORIAN WHETHER IT'S VICTORIAN KNOCKERS 
EDWARDIAN KNOBS OR REGENCY WINDOWS 
HE HAS SINGLE HANDEDLY AMASSED WHAT 
IS BELIEVED TO BE 
THE BIGGEST COLLECTION OF 
ARCHITECTURAL ARTEFACTS IN EUROPE 
THIS IS FROM BURTON STREET EUSTON 
THIS IS A PIVOTING WINDOW 
FROM THE ROYAL ARSENAL STADIUM 
I BELIEVE A HANDLE FROM THE SAVOY 
HOTEL HOTEL FROM SAINT PAUL'S CATHEDRAL 
A CAST IRON WINDOW FROM 
IRONBRIDGE IRONBRIDGE THIS IS FROM PARK STREET GUILDFORD 
A GARDEN DOOR FROM TEN DOWNING 
STREET A GEORGIAN SCREW THERE 
IT'S A VERITABLE ALADDIN'S CAVE 
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF 
ARCHITECTURAL CURIOSITIES 
FROM THE PAST FIVE CENTURIES ALL 
CRAMMED HIGGLEDY PIGGLEDY 
INTO DOZENS OF SHEDS AND 
OVERFLOWING INTO THE GARDEN 
OF HIS SURREY HOME 
BUT HOW DID HE GET TO THIS BIZARRE 
STAGE 
IT STARTED WHEN I WAS ABOUT 
THREE WITH AN INTEREST IN BAKELITE 
NUMBERS ON GATEPOSTS IN CHEAM 
THIS IS ONE OF MY EXAMPLES 
AND IT WAS CONSIDERED VERY STRANGE 
IN THOSE DAYS SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
THAT LED ON TO DOOR FURNITURE 
AND IN NINETEEN SIXTY I BECAME INTERESTED IN 
MOULDINGS AND SASH WINDOWS 
THAT REALLY FREAKED MY PARENTS OUT 
HOW OLD WHERE YOU THEN 
SASH WINDOWS STARTED WHEN 
I WAS SEVEN OR EIGHT 
THE MOULDINGS THE WAY THEY WERE 
MADE MADE EVERYONE GOT VERY WORRIED THEN 
I WENT TO EDUCATIONAL 
PSYCHIATRISTS 
FIFTY YEARS ON THAT TINY HAUL OF 
TRINKETS AND KEEPSAKES 
HAS GROWN INTO THIS MASSES AND 
MASSES OF SALVAGED SCRAP 
BURSTING AT THE SEAMS OF THIS HUGE 
WAREHOUSE WAREHOUSE THERE'S OVER EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT OF 
STUFF HERE A TESTAMENT TO HIS 
OBSESSION 
IT'S A REALLY MAJOR PASSION IN 
CHARLES'S LIFE 
EVERYTHING ELSE 
HE LIVES BREATHES AND EATS 
COLLECTING COLLECTING HE'S SO PASSIONATE ABOUT IT THAT 
HIS HOLIDAYS COMPRISE 
OF RESCUING PIECES 
OF ARCHITECTURAL DETAIL FROM OTHER 
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY 
THERE'S NOT MUCH HERE I DON'T 
THINK WE'LL LOOK AT THE WINDOWS 
A TYPICAL DAY IN CHARLES WORLD 
INVOLVES GOING UP AND DOWN THE 
COUNTRY LOOKING FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S 
JUNK WITH ANDY 
HIS TRUSTY ASSISTANT OF TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
TODAY THEY'RE RUMMAGING 
THROUGH SOME SCRAP BESIDE 
A SKIP IN HASLEMERE 
THESE ARE INTERESTING THERE ARE 
CLEMENT WINDOWS 
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS 
I CAN TELL BY THE WAY THE HINGES 
ARE MADE THE HANDLES 
THEY'RE ARTS AND CRAFTS 
THIS DESIGN WAS INTRODUCED 
IN THE LATE TWENTIES 
I'M TRYING TO PRESERVE WINDOWS 
PARTICULARLY COS IN TEN YEARS' TIME 
THERE WON'T BE MUCH OF THIS LEFT 
THESE ARE CONSIDERED JUNK 
BUT FOR PEOPLE RESTORING BUILDINGS 
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT STUDY 
SO YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE 
CUSTODIAN FOR WINDOWS IN THIS 
COUNTRY OVER THE LAST FOUR HUNDRED YEARS 
YES 
A ROLE HE TAKES SERIOUSLY 
LET'S GET THIS OUT BEFORE THEY 
SMASH IT DOWN 
AN HOUR LATER 
HE'S HAD A TIP OFF ABOUT SOME 
RATHER SPECIAL WINDOWS AT 
DEMOLITION SITE IN TOLWORTH 
BUT TIME IS AGAINST US 
THE CONTRACTORS HAVE BEEN BUSY AT 
WORK ON THE OLD MINISTRY OF DEFENCE 
BUILDING BUILDING AND WE ARRIVE JUST BEFORE THE 
CRANES CAN DO THEIR WORST 
THESE ARE KRITTLE WINDOWS 
WHAT ARE KRITTLE WINDOWS 
THEY WERE MASS PRODUCED STANDARD 
STEEL WINDOWS 
INTRODUCED BY KRITTLES OF BRAINTREE 
EVERY TWO YEARS THEY CHANGE 
THIS HANDLE DESIGN AND THE 
BRACKET DESIGN AND THE STAYS 
SO LITTLE GIVEAWAYS THAT 
THAT TYPE OF BRACKET AND HANDLE 
WAS INTRODUCED ABOUT NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT 
I'VE GOT SOME OF THE ORIGINAL 
DRAWINGS FROM KRITTLES 
THE BLUEPRINTS 
I'VE SPOKEN TO THE KRITTLE FAMILY 
THEY'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL 
L'M THE ONLY ONE COVERING THE 
KRITTLE WINDOW 
A LOT OF PEOPLE LOATHE THEM A 
LOT OF PEOPLE LOVE THEM 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT 
CHARLES HAS GOT THOUSANDS OF 
WINDOWS SIMILAR TO THIS IN HIS 
COLLECTION ALREADY 
BUT HE'S LIKE A MAGPIE 
HE CAN'T RESIST 
AND HE'S BAGGING THIS ONE TOO 
IN HIS QUEST TO GATHER AS MUCH OF 
OUR ARCHITECTURAL PAST AS POSSIBLE 
HIS COLLECTION HAS BECOME SO BIG 
HE CAN'T SEE THE WOOD 
FOR THE TREES 
YOU MUST BE CONCERNED 
AS YOU HAVE SO MUCH OUT THERE 
YOU PROBABLY HAVEN'T GOT ANY CLUE 
OF HOW MUCH AND WHAT'S THERE 
I MEAN IS IT JUST GONNA KEEP 
PILING UP 
AT THE MOMENT 
THEY'RE ALL JUMBLED UP OUT THERE 
IN THE OUTBUILDINGS AND SOMETIMES 
THERE'S BARELY A FOOTHOLD INSIDE 
IN FACT I WON'T GO INTO THE SHEDS 
THEY'RE ALL STACKED UP 
AND THEY NEED SORTING OUT PROPERLY 
CATALOGUING AND 
THEN WHERE IT'S GOING 
TO BE HOUSED IS THE WORRY 
SORRY ABOUT THIS 
IT'S A BIT OF A MESS IN HERE 
GOOD GRACIOUS CHARLES 
HOW MUCH MORE STUFF HAVE YOU GOT 
IT'S CRAZY 
THIS IS LESS THAN ONE PER CENT 
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME 
YOU SAW THIS WALL 
PROBABLY SIX YEARS AGO AT LEAST 
HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST YOU TO BE 
ABLE TO GET THIS ALL SORTED 
I SHOULD THINK ALTOGETHER 
FIVE TO SIX MILLION AT LEAST 
FIVE TO SIX MILLION 
WHAT WOULD THAT PAY FOR 
A PERMANENT HOME 
CURATORS ASSISTANTS 
CHARLES HAS TRIED RAISING SOME 
FUNDS FUNDS BUT FINANCE ISN'T HIS BEST FORTE 
I'M A HISTORIAN AND I'M QUITE SHY 
TALKING ABOUT MONEY REALLY 
THE MAIN THING IS DELIGHT IN THE 
OBJECTS AND THE HISTORY THEREOF 
NO ONE'S COVERED THE HISTORY OF 
THESE SUBJECTS 
THE WINDOWS AND DOORS STAIRCASE 
AND FIREPLACE IN THE SAME WAY 
HELL OF BONFIRE THOUGH EH 
DON'T PLEASE IT'S A FIRE RISK 
YOU CAN SEE THE PROBLEM 
I'VE GOT THOUGH 
O. K. THAT WAS A BIT UNFAIR 
BECAUSE CHARLES LIFE COLLECTION 
IS OF CRUCIAL PRACTICAL VALUE 
EVERY FRIDAY HE LECTURES AT 
GREENWICH UNIVERSITY 
PASSING ON 
HIS ARCHITECTURAL KNOWLEDGE 
TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF DESIGNERS 
HISTORIANS AND ARCHITECTS 
WITHOUT ALL THIS STUFF THESE 
STUDENTS COULDN'T LEARN ABOUT THE 
HISTORY OF ENGLISH CRAFTSMANSHIP 
THERE'S A REAL RISK THAT WITHOUT 
SOMEONE STEPPING IN TO SAVE IT 
IT'LL END UP DISPERSED AND IT MIGHT 
ACTUALLY END UP IN THE JUNK YARD 
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GREAT PITY 
THE MAIN CHALLENGE IS TO GET A 
SPACE IN WHICH OBJECTS CAN BE 
DISPLAYED DISPLAYED AND ANOTHER SPACE WHERE THE 
RESEARCH COLLECTION CAN BE STORED 
ADEQUATELY ADEQUATELY THIS HOW CHARLES DREAMS OF 
DISPLAYING HIS COLLECTION 
HE ALWAYS HAS A GOOD SELECTION 
BUT ACTUALLY THIS A COMMERCIAL 
VENTURE VENTURE DRUMMONDS A SURREY ANTIQUE 
EMPORIUM CHOC FUL OF THE DIVINE 
TREASURES CHARLES ADORES 
AND HE'S NOT ALONE 
OLD STUFF LIKE THIS IS HUGELY 
POPULAR WITH HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE 
WILLING TO FORK OUT A FORTUNE 
UMM MIGHT BE CLUE THERE FOR CHARLES CHARLES HANG ABOUT 
YOU'VE GOT THOUSANDS OF WINDOWS 
THEY'RE KNOCKING THIS ONE OUT AT 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY WHY DON'T YOU SELL SOMETHING 
AND MAKE FORTUNE 
I'M NOT A DEALER YOU SEE IT'S 
STRICTLY A MUSEUM STUDY COLLECTION 
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING YOU ABOUT 
FOR A BIT AND YOU'RE A 
BRILLIANT COLLECTOR 
BUT I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE THE BEST 
BUSINESSMAN BUSINESSMAN NO MY PASSION OVERTAKES ME 
BUT SADLY 
PASSION DOESN'T PAY THE BILLS 
HE FUNDS ALL HIS HE FUNDS ALL HIS ACTIVITIES 
ON A PART TIME LECTURER'S SALARY 
AND IT COSTS A LOT MORE BECAUSE HE 
HAS TO PAY FOR RAW MATERIALS 
AS WELL AS PEOPLE'S LABOUR 
AND HIRING VEHICLES 
AND THAT REALLY HIT HOME PUT 
TOGETHER A ROUGH BUDGET LAST YEAR 
AND I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW 
MUCH IN REALITY IT WOULD ALL COST 
HE NEEDS REGULAR FUNDING 
FROM SOME SOURCE 
TO BE ABLE TO CARRY ON DOING THIS 
BACK AT THE UNIVERSITY 
CHARLES SPACE SHORTAGE HAS REACHED 
CRUNCH POINT 
THERE'S SO MUCH STUFF IT'S BLOCKING 
THE FIRE EXIT 
I'M HAVING TO MOVE OUT 
A FEW BITS COS OBVIOUSLY 
IT'S HEALTH AND SAFETY 
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT SAFE 
IT'S SAD COS SOME OF THE BITS I USE
