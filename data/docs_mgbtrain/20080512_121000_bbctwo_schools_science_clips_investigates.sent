IT LOOKS FLAT IT FEELS FLAT MOST PEOPLE JUST ASSUMED THE EARTH WAS FLAT 
BUT IN ANCIENT GREECE SOME PEOPLE WERE ASKING QUESTIONS 
INCLUDING THE PHILOSOPHER ARISTOTLE 
HE REASONED THAT THE WORLD WAS A SPHERE AND HE ALSO HAD EVIDENCE 
WHAT WAS THIS EVIDENCE 
AT FIRST SIGHT SHIPS APPEAR TO JUST GET SMALLER AND SMALLER AS THEY DISAPPEAR INTO A HAZY HORIZON 
BUT IN THE CLEARER GREEK SKIES ARISTOTLE OBSERVED THAT THE HULL THE BOTTOM DISAPPEARED FIRST 
HE MAINTAINED THAT WOULD ONLY HAPPEN ON A CURVED SURFACE 
IF THE EARTH WAS FLAT WE'D SEE THE WHOLE SHIP GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER UNTIL IT BECOMES A DOT 
BUT ON A CURVED EARTH WHEN THE SHIP REACHES THE HORIZON THE HULL DISAPPEARS FIRST 
AND THERE WAS FURTHER EVIDENCE IN THE NIGHT SKY 
BY THIS TIME PEOPLE HAD DISCOVERED YOU SAW DIFFERENT CONSTELLATIONS AS YOU MOVED NORTH TO SOUTH 
AGAIN ARISTOTLE ARGUED THAT PROVED THE EARTH WAS ROUND 
IF YOU WERE STANDING ON FLAT EARTH LOOKING AT THE NIGHT SKY 
THEN SURELY YOU'D SEE THE SAME STARS ON THE SAME NIGHT WHEREVER YOU STOOD 
BUT NOT IF THE WORLD IS ROUND 
AND FINALLY HE OBSERVED A SHADOW CAST BY THE EARTH ON THE MOON AS IT WAS ECLIPSED 
IT WAS CURVED NOT STRAIGHT 
WHO IS THE GREATEST SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR OF ALL TIME 
OUR CONTESTANTS SPAN FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OF GROUNDBREAKING SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY 
BUT ONLY ONE OF THEM CAN BE THE WINNER 
ON TODAY'S SHOW 
TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU HE'S THE GREATEST IS 
NICOLAUS COPERNICUS 
WELCOME COPERNICUS MAY I CALL YOU NICK 
CERTAINLY WELL COME ON THEN WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU'RE THE GREATEST SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR 
YOU WERE BORN IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THEY DIDN'T HAVE SCIENCE IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE DID THEY 
OF COURSE THEY DID BUT THE SUBJECT WAS CERTAINLY UNDEVELOPED IN MANY AREAS PARTICULARLY ASTRONOMY 
FOR A START EVERYONE THOUGHT THE EARTH WAS FIXED AT THE CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE 
AND THAT THE SUN AND STARS MOVED AROUND IT 
WHY WAS THAT THEN THAT'S WHAT EVERYDAY HAPPENINGS SEEMED TO SHOW 
THE SUN APPEARED TO RISE IN THE MORNING AND MOVE ACROSS THE SKY UNTIL IT SET IN THE EVENING 
IT TOOK A WONDERFUL MIND TO THINK THAT PERHAPS THE OPPOSITE MIGHT BE HAPPENING 
THE WONDERFUL MIND BEING YOURS I TAKE IT CORRECT 
IT TAKES A GREAT SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR TO SEE WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS SEEN 
BUT TO THINK WHAT NOBODY ELSE HAS THOUGHT 
WHAT DID YOU DO SPEND EVERY NIGHT GAZING INTO THE SKY 
GOOD HEAVENS NO I RETIRED TO MY STUDY AND WORKED HARD ON MY SUMS 
YOU SEE HAVING THE SUN AND EVERYTHING MOVE AROUND THE EARTH MADE THE MATHS SO COMPLICATED 
BUT IF I TRIED THE SAME SUMS WITH THE EARTH AND PLANETS MOVING ROUND THE SUN 
EVERYTHING BECAME SO MUCH SIMPLER 
YOU'RE NOT SAYING SCIENCE ISN'T COMPLICATED 
THIS AWARD ISN'T FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING SOMETHING SIMPLE 
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THE WORLD SEEMS TO WORK IN AS SIMPLE A WAY AS POSSIBLE 
BUT DISCOVERING THAT SIMPLICITY OFTEN REQUIRES A GREAT SCIENTIST SUCH AS ME 
AND SO OF COURSE YOU THEN STUDIED THE SKIES AND TOOK MEASUREMENTS 
LIKE A GREAT SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR SHOULD ERM NO 
SHOUTED YOUR NEW THEORY TO THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD THEN 
ERM NO NOT UNTIL JUST BEFORE I DIED 
I WAS A PRIEST YOU SEE THAT WAS MY DAY JOB 
AND THE CHURCH TAUGHT THAT THE EARTH WAS AT THE CENTRE OF EVERYTHING 
IT COULD'VE GOT JOLLY TRICKY IF I'D SAID WHAT I THOUGHT 
A HA SO YOU HAD TO LEAVE IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE TO COME UP WITH THE PROOF DIDN'T YOU 
AND TAKE ON THE CHURCH DIDN'T YOU WELL WELL OF COURSE HE DID 
HE LEFT ALL THE TOUGH STUFF TO ME 
AND IT'S TIME TO MEET OUR NEXT CONTENDER 
FOR THE GREATEST SCIENTIST THAT EVER LIVED 
GALILEO GALILEI 
WELCOME GALILEO OR CAN I CALL YOU GALI 
COPERNICUS HAH OH GIVE HIM HIS DUE HE HAD A GOOD IDEA 
BUT I WAS THE MAN WHO PROVED IT WAS MORE THAN HOT AIR 
I BEGAN TO OBSERVE THE NIGHT SKY THE PLANETS MADAME 
JUPITER AND VENUS AND I TOOK MEASUREMENTS 
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF THEM 
AND WHEN I HAD ALL THE DETAILS I SAT DOWN AND I PROVED WHAT COPERNICUS COULD NOT 
THAT HIS THEORY WAS RIGHT THE EARTH DID MOVE AROUND THE SUN 
SOMEHOW I DON'T THINK YOU KEPT QUIET ABOUT IT THOUGH 
I DIDN'T I WROTE ABOUT IT I SHOUTED ABOUT IT 
EVEN THOUGH IT GOT ME INTO TROUBLE 
THE CHURCH EVEN HAD ME LOCKED UP 
BUT THEY FOUND OUT I WAS RIGHT IN THE END 
AND THAT IS WHY I DESERVE TO BE NAMED THE GREATEST SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR OF ALL TIME 
BECAUSE I EXPLAINED HOW THE WHOLE UNIVERSE WORKED 
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY TO THAT NICK 
I'M AFRAID I HAVE TO DISAGREE WITHOUT ME YOU'D HAVE NOTHING TO WORK ON 
BIG IDEAS THAT'S WHAT SCIENTISTS HAVE TO HAVE 
THAT'S WHY I AM CALLED THE FATHER OF ASTRONOMY 
I'LL CALL YOU SOMETHING IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL 
A BIG IDEA IS NO GOOD UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE IF IT'S RIGHT OR WRONG 
YOU'RE MAKING HUGE LEAPS OF A REAL ASTRONOMER MUST 
THANK YOU BOTH 
WELL WILL NICOLAUS COPERNICUS BE ELECTED GREATEST SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR OF ALL TIME 
OR WILL IT BE GALILEO GALILEI THE DECISION IS YOURS 
TODAY THERE ARE STILL BIG QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED 
HOW BIG IS THE UNIVERSE 
ARE WE ALONE OR IS THERE LIFE ON ANOTHER PLANET 
WILL THE EARTH OR THE UNIVERSE EXIST FOR EVER 
THERE IT IS THE GIANT ARIANE FIVE ROCKET 
WE HAVE ENGINE IGNITION AND LIFT OFF 
WE'RE PREPARING THE FUTURE OF THE SPACE STATION MEN GOING TO MARS 
MARS IS A GREAT PLACE TO LOOK FOR LIFE 
THERE'S ICE TRAPPED IN ROCK AT MARS' SURFACE 
WITH THE ORGANISMS THAT WE KNOW LIVE IN ROCKS IN ANTARCTICA 
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT SIMILAR SORT OF ORGANISMS MIGHT LIVE IN ROCKS ON MARS 
OH MAN THAT'S INCREDIBLE 
NASA SCIENTISTS WANTED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT COMETS 
SO THEY PROGRAMMED A SPACE PROBE TO COLLIDE WITH ONE 
IT'LL USE A NEW EXPERIMENTAL ENGINE CALLED AN ION DRIVE 
IT USES THE SUN'S ENERGY THIS CAN PROPEL THE CRAFT FIVE TIMES FASTER INTO DEEP SPACE 
PERHAPS ONE DAY WE'LL DISCOVER THE ANSWERS 
MY FAVOURITE SUBJECT IS 
MATHS 
ENGLISH 
SCIENCE MY FAVOURITE SUBJECT IS 
GEOGRAPHY 
I LIKE GEOGRAPHY BECAUSE WHEN MY FRIEND WENT TO ANOTHER COUNTRY 
IT INTERESTED ME ABOUT THE WAY PEOPLE LIVE THERE 
I ENJOY FINDING OUT ABOUT PLACES CONTINENTS AND THE COUNTRIES 
AUSTRALASIA 
AFRICA 
SOUTH AMERICA AND NORTH AMERICA 
TRYING TO WORK MY WAY AROUND THE CONTINENTS OF THE EARTH SO WE'RE OFF TO AUSTRALIA NEXT YEAR 
THE RIVERS AND THE OCEANS 
THE PACIFIC THE ATLANTIC 
THROUGH EGYPT TO SUDAN AND PAST ETHIOPIA 
I REMEMBER DRAWING PICTURES OF ROCKS BALANCING ON THE EDGES OF CLIFFS 
DIFFERENT FARMING IN WALES THERE'S 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO POSTCARDS FROM KENYA 
KENYA IS THE COUNTRY WHERE MY FAMILY AND I COME FROM 
WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT HOLIDAYS OR TOURISM IN KENYA 
AND ITS EFFECTS UPON THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE COUNTRY 
NANA WHO LIVES IN NAIROBI IS GOING ON HOLIDAY TO MOMBASA
