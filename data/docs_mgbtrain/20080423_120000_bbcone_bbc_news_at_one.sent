IT'S ENOUGH FOR THE LABOUR REBELS 
IN THE LAST HOUR THEY'VE WITHDRAWN 
THEIR CALLS FOR COMPENSATION FOR 
PEOPLE HIT BY THE CHANGE 
MR. SPEAKER WE ARE DETERMINED TO 
TAKE ACTION BECAUSE WE ARE THE 
PARTY OF FAIRNESS TACKLING POVERTY 
WE'VE HAD PANIC CONCESSIONS BEFORE 
COMING TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WE 
WERE TOLD THERE WOULD BE NO 
BACKDOWN WE'VE HAD A BACKDOWN 
SCHOOLS OUT THE B. B. C. LEARNS OVER A 
QUARTER WILL BE AFFECTED BY 
TOMORROW'S TEACHERS' STRIKE 
COUNTING THE COST OF INTERNET FRAUD 
WE REVEAL THE TRUE SCALE OF THE 
PROBLEM PROBLEM AND COULD WHAT YOU EAT FOR 
BREAKFAST AFFECT THE SEX OF YOUR 
BABY BABY ON B. B. C. LONDON NEWS 
AN INCREASE IN CAUTIONS NOT 
CONVICTIONS FOR HARD DRUGS IS THE 
MET SENDING OUT THE WRONG MESSAGE 
GOOD AFTERNOON 
FAILED WITH THE GREING BACKBENCH 
REVOLT THE GOVERNMENT HAS CAVED IN 
TO PRESSURE 
TEN 
PENCE TAX RATE THE CHANCELLOR OF 
THE EXCHEQUER HAS PROMISED TO 
COMPENSATE THOSE HIT BY THE CHANGE 
BUT ALTERING WINTER FUEL PAYMENTS 
THE MINIMUM WAGE AND TAX CREDETS 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN ENOUGH TO 
SEE OF THE REBELLION THE LABOUR 
M. P. BEHIND IT FRANK FIELD SAID IN 
THE PAST HOUR HE WON'T VOTE AGAINST 
THE GOAT VICKI YOUNG NOW REPORTS 
A WEEK AGO HE WAS DEFIANT 
INSISTING NO ONE WAS LOSING OUT 
BECAUSE OF HIS TAX PLANS TODAY 
GORDON BROWN FINALLY CAVED IN TO 
THE MOUNTING PRESSURE FROM HIS OWN 
M. P.'S THEY'RE FURIOUS THAT MORE THAN 
FIVE MILLION POORER FAMILIES HAVE 
BEEN LEFT OUT OF POCKET BY HIS 
BUDGET LAST YEAR WITH DEFEAT 
LOOMING IF A COMMONS VOTE HE 
DECIDED TO ACT 
PENSIONERS OF 
PENSIONABLE AGE SIXTY TO SIXTY FOUR WHO WERE 
BENEFITING FROM THE TEN PENCE RATE 
WE WILL BRING FORWARD PROPOSALS SO 
THAT THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL MONEY AND 
IT CAN BE PAID BACK TO APRIL THIS 
YEAR YEAR THAT IS WHY ALSO ON THE WORKING TAX 
CREDIT WHERE THERE ARE ISSUES 
ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE AND ISSUES ABOUT 
PART TIME WORKERS WE WILL ALSO 
BRING FORWARD PROPOSALS SOON IN 
TIME FOR THE PRE BUDGET REPORT 
THE GOVERNMENT'S NOT COME UP WITH 
FIGURES FOR ITS TEN PENCE TAX 
CONCESSIONS BUT IT'S LOOKING AT 
THE WINTER FUEL ALLOWANCE TO 
COMPENSATE PENSIONERS TAX CREDIT 
COULD BE ALTERED TO HELP LOW PAID 
FAMILIES AND THE MINIMUM WAGE MIGHT 
BE CHANGED FOR YOUNGER WORKERS 
BACK IN THE COMMONS THE TURMOIL IN 
LABOUR RANKS GAVE THE CONSERVATIVE 
LEADER AN EASY HIT 
THIS BEGAN 
BECAUSE AS CHANCELLOR OF THE 
EXCHEQUER HE STOOD THERE ARE AND 
PRESENTED A TAX CON BUDGET TO TRY 
AND WRONG FOOT THE OPPOSITION TO 
TRY AND POSE AS A TAX CUTTER TO 
TRY AND WIN A FEW CHEAP HEADLINES 
IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND HE DID ALL 
OF IT HE DID ALL OF IT ON THE BACK 
OF FIFTY THREE MILLION OF THE POOREST 
PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY 
AND HE DIDN'T LEAVE IT THERE 
ISN'T IT THE CASE MR. SPEAKER THAT 
THE LABOUR PARTY HAVE FINALLY 
WORKED OUT THAT THEY'VE GOT A LOSER 
NOT A LEADER 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WEIGHED IN 
TOO 
PENALISING 
THE POOR TO REWARD TOO THE RICH WAS THE JOB OF THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY SO AS THE PRIME 
MINISTER DELIBERATELY MAKES THE 
LOWEST EARNERS OVER FIVE MILLION 
OF THEM EVEN WORSE OFF IN THIS 
COUNTRY CAN HE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY IS 
HE DOING THE TORIES' JOB FOR THEM 
WE HAVE DONE MORE TO TAKE CHILDREN 
OUT OF POVERTY THAN ANY GOVERNMENT 
IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY 
SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR THIS THIS WAS UNCOMFORTABLE FOR MR. BROWN BUT 
HIS CHANGE OF HEART HAS WON OVER 
THE REBELS 
I'M IMMENSELY PLEASED 
WITH THE ACTION THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN 
BECAUSE ABOVE ALL IT'S GOING TO 
BRING PROPER COMPENSATION TO THOSE 
WHO WOULD OTHERWISE LOSE OUT THE THE TEN PENCE ROW HAS BEEN A DISASTER 
OF MR. BROWN'S OWN MAKING HE SAID 
HE COULDN'T REWRITE THE BUG BUT 
TODAY IT'S COVERED IN A LOT OF RED 
INK 
TODAY IT'S COVERED IN A LOT OF RED INK INK THE CHIEF SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY 
YVETTE COOPER IS IN WESTMINSTER NOW 
THANKS FOR JOINING US YOUR 
GOVERNMENT SAID THERE WOULD BE NO 
U. TURN ON THIS THIS CAN'T BE 
CALLED ANYTHING ELSE BUT 
WE ARE 
IMPLEMENTING THE CHANGES IN THE 
FINANCE BILL THIS IS PART OF A 
MAJOR PACKAGE OF REFORMS WHICH 
BENEFITS THE MAJORITY OF HOUSEHOLDS 
AND IN PARTICULAR PROVIDES THE MOST 
HELP FOR THE POOREST THIRD OF 
HOUSEHOLDS IN THE COUNTRY BECAUSE 
OF THINGS LIKE TAX CREDITS AS WELL 
AS THE CUT IN THE BASIC RATE OF TAX 
AS WELL WE'VE SAID WE DO WANT TO 
DO MORE TO HELP THOSE WHO DON'T 
BENEFIT FROM THIS PACKAGE OF 
CHANGES THE CHANCELLOR OF THE 
EXCHEQUER HAD ALREADY SAID THAT 
WHAT WE HAVE DONE TODAY IS SET OUT 
MORE OF THE DETAIL OF THE WORK 
WE'VE ALREADY GOT UNDER WAY 
PARTICULARLY TO HELP PEOPLE BETWEEN 
SIXTY AND SIXTY FIVE WHERE WE WANT TO DO MORE 
FORGIVE ME THAT IS A HARD SELL 
GIVING THE TIMING OF ALL OF THIS 
THE HEADLINES TOMORROW WILL NOT BE 
FAVOURABLE TOMORROW A LOSER NOT 
LEADER SAYS DAVID CAMERON 
THIS IS 
ABOUT HELPING HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY FAMILIES AS I SAID DO 
BENEFIT ALREADY FROM THIS PACKAGE 
BUT THERE ARE SOME GROUPS WE'VE 
SAID WE WANT TO DO MORE FOR AND WE 
WILL BE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO TRY AND 
HELP PARTICULARLY PENSIONERS AGED 
SIXTY TO SIXTY FIVE SURE 
THAT IS THE RIGHT SURE THING FOR US TO DO THIS IS PRIME 
MINISTER WHO HAS DONE MORE THAN 
ANYTHING OTHER IN OUR HISTORY TO 
HELP PARTICULARLY GET CHILDREN OUT 
OF POVERTY AND PENSIONERS IN 
POVERTY AS WELL 
WHY NOT DO IT IN 
THE FIRST PLACE 
WE HAVE ALREADY AT 
EVERY STAGE DONE MORE AND MORE TO 
HELP THE CHANGES HELP HALF A 
MILLION CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY WE 
HAD ALREADY DONE MORE IN THE LATEST 
BUDGET TO HELP MORE CHILDREN WHAT 
WE ARE SAYING IS AS PART OF THE 
PRE BUDGET REPORT IN THE AUTUMN TO 
DO MORE AND LOOK AT WAYS 
PARTICULARLY TO HELP PENSIONERS 
BUT ALSO TO LOOK AT WAYS FOR THOSE 
WITHOUT CHILDREN PEOPLE WHO DON'T 
NECESSARILY BENEFIT FROM ALL OF THE 
TAX CREDITS THAT ARE IN PLACE AT 
THE MOMENT TO LOOK AT WHAT MORE WE 
CAN DO TO HELP THEM IN THE FUTURE 
AS WELL THIS IS ABOUT BUILDING ON 
LOOKING AT MORE WAYS TO HELP PEOPLE 
YVETTE COOPER THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
LET'S TALK TO OUR POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT JAMES LAND DETAIL 
WHO IS AT THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT 
FOR US YOU HAVE PRESUMABLY BEEN 
LISTENING TO THAT WHAT IS YOUR 
ASSESSMENT ON WHY THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS CHANGED ITS MIND ON THIS THERE THERE IS AN OBVIOUS REASON THERE WAS A 
POTENTIALLY DAMAGING REBELLION NEXT 
MONDAY AHEAD OF THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS THIS COULD HAVE CROWDED 
OUT UP TO THAT MONDAY GOVERNMENT 
HAD TO ACT THE MORE SUBTLE REASON 
IS THIS THIS IS A LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT AND MOVEMENT HERE AT 
WESTMINSTER THAT FOR ALL OF THE 
YEARS OF TONY BLAIR AND THE MARKET 
REFORMS THEY'VE COMFORTED 
THEMSELVES BY SAYING WE ARE DOING 
SOMETHING ON POVERTY ON PENSIONER 
POVERTY ON THIS ISSUE THEY WERE 
MILES AWAY FROM THAT THEY WERE 
HITTING THE LEAST WELL OFF IN 
SOCIETY THAT MESSAGE GOT THROUGH 
TO THE TREASURY AND THE GOVERNMENT 
THEY SIMPLY HAD TO MOVE JAMES JAMES THANK YOU

LOT MORE 
WITH ME NOW IN THE STUDIO IS ANDREW 
GOODWILL AN EXPERT ON INTERNET 
FRAUD WHAT IS YOUR VIEW IS THIS 
BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY POLICE AND

MUSHROOMING PROBLEM WE NEED TO GET 
TO GRIPS WITH IT HOW 
WE NEED TO HOW HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF POLICING 
POLICING OF THIS PARTICULAR SUBJECT 
HAS BEEN LAX OVER THE LAST FEW 
YEARS WE REALLY NEED TO GET TO 
GRIPS AND SET UP SOME SPECIAL 
POLICE UNITS TO POLICE THIS PROBLEM 
WHAT CAN WE DO AS CONSUMERS TO HELP 
OURSELVES HOW DO YOU TELL IF A 
SITE IS SECURE FOR EXAMPLE EVERY EVERY CONSUMER AND EVERY MEMBER OF THE 
PUBLIC AS PART OF A TRANSACTION AS 
A RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT 
THEY ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING AND 
THEY'RE BUYING GOODS FROM A COMPANY 
THAT'S WELL RECOGNISED THEY'RE NOT 
JUST BUYING BECAUSE OF PRICE AND 
NOT BEING BLINKERED BECAUSE GOODS

WEB ADDRESS AT THE TOP OF THE 
WEBSITE IT NEEDS TO SAY HTTPS NOT NOT H. T. T. P. CORRECT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH H. T. T. P. CORRECT MORE DETAILS ON THE B. B. C. WEBSITE 
ANDREW THANK YOU 
IT'S THOUGHT OVER A QUARTER OF ALL 
SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND AND WALES WILL 
BE CLOSED OR PARLGSLY SHUT TOMORROW 
AS STAFF WALK OUT OVER PAY MORE 
THAN SIX THOUSAND ARE EXPECTED TO BE 
AFFECTED BY THE STRIKE WHICH IS 
BEING CALLED BY THE NATIONAL UNION 
OF TEACHERS JAMES WESTHEAD IS OUR 
EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT AND IS HERE 
TO EXPLAIN WHY IT'S THE FIRST 
NATIONAL TEACHERS' STRIKE IN MORE 
THAN TWENTY YEARS 
KATE THAT'S RIGHT 
THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS HAS 
TALKED A LOT ABOUT STRIKES BUT 
IT'S A LONG TIME SINCE IT'S 
ACTUALLY STAGED ONE NATIONALLY THE 
LAST SCENES LIKE THESE WERE TWENTY ONE 
YEARS AGO DURING THE LAST NATIONAL 
TEACHERS' STRIKE IN THE EIGHTIES 
HOW MUCH DISRUPTION WILL THIS ONE 
CAUSE CAUSE A B. B. C. SURVEY OF MORE THAN HALF OF 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN ENGLAND AND 
WALES SUGGEST AROUND SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SCHOOLS 
ARE PLANNING TO CLOSE AT LEAST 
PARSLEY FOR THE ONE DAY STRIKE 
THAT IS ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT OF ALL SECONDARY 
AND PRIMARY SCHOOLS MORE THAN HAD 
BEEN EXPECTED AND SURE TO 
INCONVENIENCE PARENTS 
IT'S THE FIRST STRIKE FOR TWENTY YEARS 
IS IT L. DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT 
THEY'RE STRIKING ABOUT THEY APPEAR 
TO BE WELL PAID 
I'M A WORKING 
PARENT I TOTALLY SUPPORT THE 
ACTION THAT THE TEACHERS ARE 
FEELING THEY HAVE TO TAKE IT'S IT'S QUITE HARD TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS 
AROUND IT THEY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN 
US TIME IN ADVANCE AS WELL 
SO WHAT IS THE STRIKE ABOUT 
THE GOVERNMENT IS OFFERING TEACHERS 
A PAY RISE OF JUST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR PER CENT THAT WAS 
RECOMMENDED BY AN INDEPENDENT PAY 
REVIEW BODY AND ACCEPTED BY OTHER 
TEACHING UNIONS BUTT BIGGEST THE 
NUT SAY TEACHERS NEED FORTY ONE PER CENT TO KEEP 
UP WITH THEIR PREFERRED LEVEL OF 
INFLATION 
IT IS TRUE THAT THE INFLATION GOVERNMENT DID PUT SOME MONEY INTO 
TEACHERS' PAY EARLY ON BUT AT 
THREE YEARS OF BELOW INFLATION 
INCREASES IT'S BEGINNING THAT 
TEACHERS' PAY IS BEING ERODED I I CAN'T SEE WHAT THE TEACH VERSE TO 
MOAN ABOUT BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT 
WILL FUND THE AWARD IN FULL L. L. 
DON'T THINK THE NUT WOULD BE VERY 
PLEASED IF THAT WAS THE OUTCOME 
NOT ALL SCHOOLS WILL BE AFFECTED 
BUT BY NOW MOST SHOULD HAVE 
NOTIFIED PARENTS WHETHER THEY WILL 
HAVE TO CLOSE THE NUT HASN'T RULED 
OUT FURTHER ACTIONS SO THE BIG 
QUESTION IS WHETHER THIS ONE DAY 
STRIKE WILL BE THE END OR JUST THE 
BEGINNING OF THE DISPUTE 
LET'S SPEAK NOW TO THE SCHOOLS 
MINISTER JIM KNIGHT WHO IS IN OUR 
WESTMINSTER STUDIO FOR US YOU HAVE 
SAID THIS IS REGRETTABLE AND YOU 
SHARE THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF PARENTS 
MANY OF WHOM WILL HAVE TO TAKE TIME 
OFF WORK TO LOOK AFTER THEIR 
CHILDREN SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE DONE 
MORE TO PREVENT THIS FROM 
HAPPENING 
I DO SHARE WHAT IS HAPPENING BECOMING FRUSTRATION AND MORE THAN 
DISAPPOINTMENT FROM PARENTS THAT I 
HAVE SPOKEN TO TODAY AND HEARD ON 
PHONE INS AND IN MEDIA CLIPS LIKE 
THE ONES WE'VE JUST HEARD AND AS 
JAMES WAS SAYING IN YOUR PIECE THIS 
IS AS A RESULT OF AN INDEPENDENT 
PAY REVIEW BODY IT'S A PROCESS 
THAT TAKES ALMOST TWO YEARS OF 
GIVING THEM A REMIT TO LOOK AT 
THINGS LIKE INFLATION BUT 
RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF 
TEACHERS INTO THE PROFESSION 
AFFORDABILITY FOR EMPLOYERS 
EVIDENCE WAS GIVEN BY OURSELVES AND 
BY THE TRADE UNIONS INCLUDING THE 
NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS AND AS A 
RESULT OF THAT THEY PRODUCED THEIR 
RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WE AS A 
GOVERNMENT IN GOOD FAITH HAVE 
ACCEPTED IN FULL WE CAN'T REOPEN 
THAT PROCESS 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
MADE A LOT IN IMPROVING TEACHERS' 
PAY SOW DON'T HAVE SYMPATHY CAN 
THE NUT WHO SAY THEY ARE GOING 
BACKWARDS IN THE RATE OF PAY 
BECAUSE THEIR PAY IS BELOW THE RATE 
OF INFLATION 
PARENT ARE BEWILDERED 
BECAUSE THEY HEAR THAT THE AVERAGE 
TEACHERERNS ABOUT THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND THEIR 
PAY HAS GONE UP BY NINETEEN PER CENT IN REAL 
TERMS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AND THAT A TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE PER CENT 
THEY'RE GETTING MORE THAN THE TWO PER CENT 
BENCHMARK FOR PUBLIC SECTOR PAY 
LAST YEAR AS ONE PARENT SAID THEY 
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE STRIKE IS 
ABOUT 
JIM KNIGHT THANK YOU VERY ABOUT MUCH 
POACHERS POSE AN INCREASING THREAT 
TO BRITISH WILDLIFE THAT ACCORDING 
TO POLICE THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE 
CRIME UNIT SAYS ORGANISED GANGS ARE 
INVOLVED AND THEY STRESS THAT 
POACHING IS FAR FROM THE ROMANTIC 
IMAGE OF ONE FOR THE PART ENDED UP 
IN THE PAST DANNY SAVAGE IS ON THE 
RIVER TYNE THE RIVER TYNE USED TO 
BE ONE OF THE MOST POLLUTED RIVERS 
IN THE COUNTRY BUT IN RECENT YEARS 
IT'S BEEN CLEANED UP AS A RESULT 
OF THAT IT'S NOW ONE OF THE BEST 
SALMON RIVERS IN THE U. K. BUT THAT 
MEANS COME LATE SUMMER OR EARLY 
AUTUMN THERE ARE GANGS OF POACHERS 
OPERATING HERE PULLING SALMON OUT 
AND SELLING THEM ON FOR PROFIT BUT 
IT'S NOT JUST ON THE RIVERS THAT 
THE POACHERS ARE TARGETING IT'S ON 
LAND AS WELL IN PARTICULAR DEAR 
I'VE BEEN A ONE OPERATION AIMED AT 
PROTECTING THEM IN CUMBRIA LATE AT 
NIGHT IN THE LAKE DISTRICT THIS IS 
HOW POACHER'S WORK CATCH A DEER 
STAG IN THE BEAM OF A LAMP AND THEY 
CAN START TO BEHAVE NOT TIMIDLY 
BUT ALMOST LIKE A TAME ANIMAL 
WITHIN A FEW SECONDS THIS DEER HAS 
WALKED ALMOST DRIED UP TO THE LIGHT 
APPROACH IT WOULD NOW SEND A DOG 
DOWN THE BEAM OR USE A RIFLE BUT 
THIS THAT IS LUCKY THE LAMP HOLDER 
IS A POLICEMAN 
THE OLD ROMANTIC 
IMAGE OF A GUY LIVING IN A COUNTRY 
WITH A FAMILY ON A LOW WAGE NIPPING 
OUT THE BACK DOOR INTO THE WOODS 
AND FIELDS AT NIGHT TO TAKE A 
RABBIT OR A PHEASANT OR TWO TO FEED 
HIS FAMILY JUST ISN'T TRUE ANY MORE 
THESE PEOPLE ARE IN IT MAINLY FOR 
MONEY AND SOMETIMES FOR WHAT THEY 
WERE CAUGHT SPORT I CERTAINLY 
WOULDN'T 
WE WERE OUT ON ANTI WOULDN'T POACHING OPERATION FOLLOWING A 
BRIEFING EARLIER IN THE EVENING 
WE'RE GOING TO DO THE SAME AS WE 
NORMALLY DO WHICH IS PEOPLE GOING 
OUT TO THE PLACES THAT THEY'VE 
SELECTED TO REPORT IN ANY ILLEGAL 
ACTIVITY 
GAMEKEEPERS AND ACTIVITY LANDOWNERS WERE TAKING PART TRYING 
TO TACKLE A GROWING PROBLEM I I REGARDED AS STEALING AND ARMED 
ROBBERY ROBBERY IF SOMEBODY CAME 
INTO YOUR HOUSE WITH A GUN AND 
NICKED YOUR TELEVISION THAT WOULD 
BE REGARDED BY THE POLICE AS ARMED 
ROBBERY I CAN'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE 
ONE OF THE WATCHERS HAS SEEN 
PICK UP IN THE AREA THEY SHONE 
SPOTLIGHT ON HIM 
A FEW HOURS LATER 
THE WATCHING PAYS OFF BUT FINDING 
THE SUSPICIOUS CAR IN A MAZE OF 
COUNTRY LANES IS DIFFICULT 
A ON 
THEIR THERE WAS A DOUBLE CAB PICK 
UP 
WITHIN MINUTES THE NETWORK OF UP WATCHERS GETS A RESULT STANDBY STANDBY BUT THESE ARE SO IT SUSPICIOUS 
PICK UP TURNS OUT TO BE LOCAL FARMER 
I THOUGHT SOMEBODY WAS FARMER AFTER MY DEAR IN THE BOTTOM FIELDS 
IT PROVES THE SYSTEM WORKS DOESN'T 
IT NEXT TIME YOU GO OUT LAMBLIN 
GIVE US A RING 
IT SHORTLY AFTER 
MIDNIGHT AND TONIGHT'S OPERATION IS 
WINDING DOWN EVEN KNOCKED THOUGH 
NO POACHERS HAVE BEEN CAUGHT IT IS 
REGARDED AS A SUCCESS BECAUSE 
THERE'S A FEELING THAT THE WORD IS 
OUT THAT POACHING IS BEING TAKEN 
SERIOUSLY AS A PROBLEM IN CUMBRIA 
WHETHER THAT MEANS THE PROBLEM IS 
JUST HAS JUST MOVED ON ISN'T YET 
CLEAR BUT AT LEAST THESE DEER ARE 
BEING AFFORDED SOME PROTECTION AT 
THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY OFFICERS TO 
OPERATE HERE WEST GABFESTS CARRY 
HANDCUFFS AND CARRY BATTENS AS WELL 
TO EMPHASISE THAT THE PEOPLE 
CARRYING OUT THE POACHING ARE OFTEN 
CRIMINAL GANGS OUR TOP STORY THE 
CHANCELLOR SAYS HE WILL BRING IN 
MEASURES TO HELP THOSE HIT BY THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. TAX RATE 
COMING UP FIGHTING ON HILLARY 
CLINTON'S PRESIDENTIAL HOPES ARE 
STILL ALIVE AFTER A WIN IN 
PENNSYLVANIA LATER THE LAST 
MINUTE OWN GOAL THAT CHANGED 
EVERYTHING FOR CHELSEA AND JAZZ 
FROM A SMALL ISLAND WHAT HAPPENED 
WHEN LONDONER COURTNEY PINE WENT 
NORTH 
WHAT YOU HAVE FOR BREAKFAST COULD 
INFLUENCE WHETHER YOU GIVE BIRTH TO 
A GIRL OR BOY THAT'S ACCORDING TO 
NEW RESEARCH THAT SUGGESTS THAT 
WOMEN WHO EAT CEREAL FOR BREAKFAST 
AND I CAN SEE BY MARGINALLY MORE 
LIKELY TO HAVE BOYS AS ARE THOSE 
WHO GENERALLY HAVE A HIGH CALORIE 
DIET 
ONE FINGER ONE THUMB WOULD DIET WOULD BE A BABY IS BOY OREGON IS MOSTLY 
DOWN TO CHANCE AS THE DEANS IN 
MAN'S SPERM DETERMINE A BABY'S SEX 
BUT THE NEW STUDY HAS FOUND A LINK 
WITH MUMS DIET NOT DURING 
PREGNANCY BUT AROUND THE TIME SHE 
CONCEIVED THOSE WHO ATE MORE AND 
HAD A HEALTHIER DIET WITH WIDER 
RANGE OF NUTRIENTS HAD JUST 
SLIGHTLY MORE BOYS AND ESPECIALLY 
THOSE WHO ATE CEREAL FOR BREAKFAST 
MOST PARENTS ARE JUST HAPPY TO HAVE 
A HEALTHY BABY WHATEVER THE SEX 
BUT IF THEY DO HAVE A SLIGHT 
PREFERENCE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER 
THEN IT SEEMS THAT ADJUSTING THE 
WOMAN'S DIET MAY BE ONE WAY TO 
INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME BUT SOME 
SCIENTISTS ARE VERY SCEPTICAL ABOUT 
THE FINDINGS WHAT DO THE MUMS MAKE 
A BIT 
I SEEM TO REMEMBER EATING 
QUITE A LOT AT THE TIME AND I'VE 
ALWAYS LOVED SEE REAL THAT WOULD 
MEAN THAT I WOULD HAVE A BOY BUT 
SHE IS A GOAL 
I WAS CONSUMING A 
LOT OF CALORIES WHEN I CONCEIVED L. 
EAT A LOT OF CEREAL AND I HAVE A 
BOY IT'S NOT THE CASE EVERYONE 
HERE BUT IT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE 
FOR ME 
THE RESEARCHER WHO CARRIED 
OUT THE WORKS SAYS DIET COULD ONLY 
ALTER THE CHANCES OF HAVING A BABY 
OF ONE SEX OR THE OTHER BY ABOUT TEN 
PER CENT BUT IT COULD EXPLAIN WHY BIRTHS 
OF BOYS IN SOME COUNTRIES ARE LOWER 
THAN EXPECTED 
OVER THE PAST THIRTY 
YEARS YOUNG WOMEN IN PARTICULAR 
ARE ACTUALLY DECREASING THEIR 
CALORIE INTAKE ON AVERAGE THERE IS 
ALSO AN INCREASE IN OVER AND 
HEALTHY EATING PATTERNS LIKE 
SKIPPING BREAKFAST AS MY RESEARCH 
SHOWED HEALTHY EATING PATTERNS 
INCLUDING REGULAR BREAKFAST EATING 
SEEMS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING 
BOYS 
FOR CENTURIES PARENTS HAVE BOYS TRIED EVERYTHING FROM PRYER'S TO 
BLACK MAGIC IN AN EFFORT TO 
INFLUENCE THE SEX OF THEIR CHILDREN 
MIDWIVES SAY THE NEW RESEARCH 
SHOULD BE TREATED WITH CAUTION AND 
MUMS HEALTHY DIET IS WHAT IS 
PARAMOUNT AND NOT CHOOSING THE SEX 
OF THE BABY POLICE IN REDDITCH ARE 
STILL SEARCHING FOR A TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD 
DISABLED MAN WHOSE MOTHER WAS FOUND 
DEAD TWO DAYS AGO JAMES HUGHES HAS 
THE MENTAL AGE OF AN EIGHTEEN MONTH OLD 
CHILD HE WAS REPORTED MISSING WITH 
HIS MOTHER HEATHER WARDLE ON 
SATURDAY WHAT IS THE LATEST ON THE 
SEARCH FOR JAMES 
THIS IS THE 
LOCATION WHERE THE BODY OF THIRTY NINE YEAR 
OLD HEATHER WARDLE WAS FOUND ON 
MONDAY EVENING IT'S LESS THAN A 
MILE FROM THE HOUSE IN THE 
CHURCHILL AREA OF REDDITCH A POST 
MORTEM EXAMINATION WAS CARRIED OUT 
ON HER BODY YESTERDAY AND POLICE 
HAVE REVEALED INITIAL RESULTS THEY 
BELIEVE THE CAUSE OF DEATH TO BE 
HANGING SHE LEAVES BEHIND FOUR 
BOYS THE YOUNGEST OF WHICH IS SIX 
YEARS OLD THE CONCERN IS THE MAIN 
PRIORITY FOR THE POLICE TO SEARCH 
FOR HER MISSING SEVERELY DISABLED 
SON JAMES HUGHES THE CONCERN HERE 
IS THAT HE HAS THE MENTAL AGE OF A 
TODDLER HE HAS AUTISM EPILEPSY 
AND A HOST OF OTHER PROBLEMS WHICH 
POLICE SAY HE ABSOLUTELY CANNOT 
FEND FOR HIMSELF TODAY THEY HAVE 
BEEN SEARCHING THIS AREA HERE 
FORENSIC TEAMS HAVE BEEN IN THEY 
HAVE ALSO BEEN SPECIALIST SEARCH 
TEAMS SEARCHING THROUGH THE 
UNDERGROWTH THIS AREA WAS EXTENDED 
EARLIER THIS MORNING THEY ARE 
LOOKING IN OTHER AREAS THEY ARE 
ALSO GOING TO BE CONDUCTING DOOR 
TO DOOR CHOIR IS BECAUSE THEY NEED 
TO BUILD UP A PICTURE OF HOW THIS 
HAPPENED BEFORE FRIDAY BECAUSE 
THEY SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW WHEN OR 
WHERE JAMES WAS LAST SEEN THEY 
HAVE BEEN SOME UNCONFIRMED 
SIGHTINGS AND THEY ARE TRYING TO 
PHONE THEM UP TO FIND OUT WHAT MAY 
HAVE HAPPENED AND WHERE JAMES NOW 
IS 
THE MORRISONS SUPERMARKET CHAIN IS HAS WON ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN DAMAGES FROM

AFTER THAT 
HOSTILE REACTION THERE FOLLOWED

TERRORISM THE SCARE OF BOATS ALL

ASKING THE TOUGH QUESTIONS BEFORE

BARACK OBAMA STILL RETAINS THE 
OVERALL LEAD BUT HER ATTACKS AND 
HIS MISSTEPS SEEM TO HAVE HEARD 
THE WHITE WORKING CLASS VOTERS HE 
SO CAREFULLY COURTED TURNED OUT IN 
FORCE BUT NOT FOR HIM SO HILLARY 
CLINTON'S 
PERSEVERANCE AND 
RESILIENCE IS PAYING OFF SHE IS

BREAKTHROUGH YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE

BY GOING TO OUR WEBSITE 
ENERGY COMPANIES GOVERNMENT 
MINISTERS AND CAMPAIGNERS MET THIS 
MORNING TO TACKLE THE ISSUE OF FUEL 
POVERTY THEY DISCUSSED WAYS TO 
HELP POORER PEOPLE WHO ARE 
STRUGGLING TO MEET THE RISING COST 
OF HEATING THEIR HOMES FOUR MILLION 
PEOPLE ARE DEFINED AS LIVING IN 
FUEL POVERTY SPENDING AT LEAST TEN 
PER CENT OF THEIR INCOME ON ENERGY BILLS 
THAT MEETING HAS JUST FINISHED 
FIRST PUT IT INTO CONTEXT FOR US 
AS TO WHY THIS MEETING WAS CALLED 
BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN BIG ENERGY 
RISES SINCE THE START OF THE YEAR 
AND THERE IS GROWING DISQUIET ABOUT 
THE IMPACT IS THIS HAVING ON 
GULLIBLE CUSTOMERS THE AVERAGE 
HOUSEHOLD ENERGY PILLARS ABOVE 
ONE THOUSAND IT'S ONE THOUSAND FIFTY EIGHT WHICH MEANS 
THAT FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 
SO FAR PRICES HAVE ALREADY GONE UP 
TO DOMESTIC USERS BY AROUND FIFTEEN PER CENT 
ENERGY PRICES AROUND THE WORLD ARE 
CONTINUING TO RISE THERE IS 
ALREADY SPECULATION THAT HE COULD 
SEE ANOTHER ROUND OF PRICE RISES TO 
DOMESTIC CUSTOMERS PERHAPS AS EARLY 
AS THE SUMMER 
WHAT THEN HAVE THEY 
BEEN ABLE TO DECIDE WHAT THEY CAN 
ACHIEVE 
THERE IS GOING TO BE AN ACHIEVE ACTION PLAN RELEASED IN MAY WHICH 
IS REALLY GOING TO TRY TO TARGET 
HELP TO UNRAVEL CUSTOMERS IT HAS 
BECOME REALLY HARD TO IDENTIFY WHO 
ARE THE VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS 
ENERGY CUSTOMERS CODGERS IN THE 
DEPARTMENT OF WORK AND PENSIONS AND 
SAY OF WHICH OF OUR CUSTOMERS ARE 
ON BENEFITS IT'S AGAINST DATA 
PROTECTION LAW THERE IS A LOT MORE 
HELP TO GET CUSTOMERS TO GET THE 
BEST DEAL WHICH COMES DOWN TO 
SWITCHING BUT PERHAPS THE MOST 
INTERESTING AREA IS TO ENSURE THAT 
THE TARIFFS ON DIFFERENT PAYMENT 
METHODS ARE FAIR AND JUSTIFIED 
WHAT THAT IS GETTING AT IS THE FACT 
THAT FOR LONG TIME PEOPLE ON PRE 
PAYMENT METERS WHO OFTEN AMONGST 
THE LOWEST INCOME FAMILIES THEY 
HAVE OFTEN PAID HUNDREDS OF POUNDS 
MORE THAN PEOPLE WHO PAY BY DIRECT 
DEBIT 
FINALLY IT'S THE END OF A DEBIT GREAT MYSTERY ROMANCE FOR YEARS 
THE SINGERS BEYONCE AND JAY Z. HAVE 
BEEN ROMANTICALLY LINKED NOW A 
LICENCE HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE 
AUTHORITIES IN NEW YORK IT APPEARS 
TO CONFIRM THEY ARE NOW MARRIED 
THE COUPLE HELD A LAVISH PARTY IN 
MANHATTAN EARLIER THIS MONTH BUT 
OBVIOUSLY FORGOT TO MENTION THAT 
THEY WERE CELEBRATING THEIR 
MARRIAGE CONGRATULATIONS TO THEM 
THERE ARE SOME LOVELY WEATHER 
AROUND TODAY SOME OF US WALK UP TO 
THE MORNING RAINFALL BUT THE GOOD 
NEWS IS THAT THAT RAIN IS CLEARING 
AWAY AND WE ARE LEFT WITH A WARM 
AND SUNNY AFTERNOON THE REASON WHY 
WE HAD THE RAIN IS BECAUSE OF THIS 
BAND OF CLOUD YOU CAN SEE THAT 
MEANS THAT THE RAIN DIDN'T LAST FOR 
VERY LONG BUT IT WAS QUITE HEAVY IN 
A FEW PLACES BEHIND IT THE 
SUNSHINE HAS BEEN POKING THROUGH 
FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE 
AFTERNOON THE WEATHER IS LOOKING 
VERY PLEASANT FIFTEEN DEGREES MODEST 
TEMPERATURES NICE WEATHER ACROSS 
THE MIDLANDS APART FROM A FEW 
SHOWERS BUT YOU WILL NOTICE ACROSS 
THE EASTERN COUNTIES OF BRITAIN WE 
STILL HAVE THAT STUBBORN CLOUD AND 
THE BITS OF BRAIN AS WELL SOME 
RAIN ACROSS THE NORTH EAST OF 
SCOTLAND BUT THE BEST OF THE 
WEATHER ACROSS SCOTLAND IS THE 
WESTERN ISLES AND THE SOUTH WEST 
IN NORTHERN IRELAND THERE IS A 
MIXTURE OF SUNNY SPELLS AND SHOWERS 
TEMPERATURES AROUND ABOUT THE MID 
TEENS AND ACROSS WALES YOU WILL 
CONTINUE TO ENJOY THE CLEAR BLUE 
SKIES AND TEMPERATURES OF FIFTEEN 
DEGREES SIMILAR WEATHER ACROSS 
CORNWALL AND DEVON INTO WILTSHIRE 
AND SOMERSET A BEAUTIFUL END TO 
THE DAY A FINE SUNSET DRIVE FOR 
THE FIRST PART OF THE NIGHT BUT 
THEN LATER IN THE NIGHT OF HIS 
ROUND TO WITH MORE RAIN ON THE 
WEIGHT GETTING INTO NORTHERN 
IRELAND INTO WALES AND THE SOUTH 
WEST IF YOU ARE AN EARLY BIRDIE 
WILL PROBABLY GET SOME SUNSHINE 
ACROSS THE EAST BUT IT WON'T BE 
LONG BEFORE THE RAIN IN THE WEST 
STARTS SPREADING EASTWARDS THROUGH 
THE COURSE OF THE MORNING MOST OF 
US WILL SEE THE RAIN FOR TOMORROW 
MORNING SOME OF IT WILL BE QUITE 
HEAVY AROUND THE RUSH HOUR 
TOMORROW WILL BE MARGINALLY WORSE 
THE RAIN WILL BE CLEARING OUT INTO 
THE NORTH SEA BUT RATHER THAN THE 
SUNSHINE WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE GOT 
TODAY TOMORROW WE'RE GOING TO SEE 
SUNSHINE AND HEAVY SHOWERS FRIDAY 
IS LOOKING QUITE NICE WITH SOME 
GOOD SUNSHINE AROUND HOWEVER IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND WE ARE SEEING 
SIGNS OF RAIN AND BAD RAIN WILL 
SPREAD ITS WAY ACROSS FRIDAY NIGHT 
ACROSS MODES PARTS OF THE COUNTRY 
YOUR BEST BET FOR GOOD DRY WARM 
WEATHER ACROSS THE SOUTH OF THE 
COUNTRY IS SATURDAY SUNDAY IS MORE 
MIXED IN THE NORTH OF THE COUNTRY 
IT IS THE OTHER WAY ROUND IT LOOKS 
AS THOUGH SATURDAY WILL BE THE 
WETTER DAY AND THEN SUNDAY WILL BE 
A MIXTURE OF SUNNY SPELLS AND 
SHOWERS OVERALL THE WEEKEND IS A 
BIT MIXED DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU 
ARE 
STILL TO COME A ROUND UP OF THE 
BUSINESS NEWS AND SPORT PLUS 
REACTION TO THAT GOVERNMENT U. TURN
