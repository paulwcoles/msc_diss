HAVE ALL THE DETAILS BACK IN 
LONDON MR. BROWN FACES ANOTHER 
PARLIAMENTARY TEST TRYING TO PUSH 
THROUGH A NEW BILL REGULATED HUMAN 
ANIMAL HYBRID EMBRYOS FOR RESEARCH 
WE HEAR BOTH SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT 
ALSO TODAY THE LATEST PLANS FROM 
GOVERNMENT FOR SUPPORTING OUR ARMED 
FORCES THE FORMER TORY M. P. HIRED BY 
THE PRIME MINISTER TO LOOK AT THE 
ISSUE PROPOSES A NATIONAL DAY OF 
REGULAR NATIONAL 
AND WE REPORT ON THE LATEST ATTEMPT 
BY LOCAL COUNCILS TO CURB 
CONGESTION 
NOBODY LIKES LIVIES OR CONGESTION TAXES BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IF 
YOU DON'T DO SOMETHING PEOPLE WILL 
BLAME RETROSPECTIVELY SO IN A 
SENSE YOU CAN'T WIN 
ALL THAT IS COMING UP IN THE NEXT 
HALF AN HOUR AND WITH US FOR THE 
WHOLE PROGRAMME TODAY IS THE FORMER 
EDITOR OF THE SUN KELVIN MACKENZIE 
WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMME LET'S 
PARTICULAR OFF WITH THE REPORT ON 
THE ARMED FORCES WITHIN THE LAST 
HOUR THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE M. P. WHO 
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER JOINED LABOUR 
LAST SUMMER GAVE HIS 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BOOSTING 
SUPPORT FOR THE SERVICES 
WE HAVE A 
WHOLE LOT OF PROPOSALS ALL OF 
WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO BRING THE 
ARMED FORCES AND THE REST OF 
SOCIETY CLOSER TOGETHER AND A 
CLOSER UNDERSTANDING OF THE 
MILITARY THE MOST DRAMATIC ONES 
ARE PROPOSALS FOR WEARING UNIFORMS 
MORE AND PROPOSALS FOR CADETS AND 
VETERANS DAYS AND LEGISLATION TO 
PROTECT THE UNIFORM SO WE DON'T 
HAVE ANY CASES IN THE FUTURE OF 
DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT OF 
PEOPLE WEARING UNIFORMS 
WHAT DO 
YOU MAKE OF THOSE IDEAS CADETS' 
DAYS AND MORE RECOGNISES OF THE 
ARMED FORCES 
THERE IS NOTHING YOU 
CAN TAKE TO TASK ABOUT THAT BUT 
IT'S THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE 
LEGISLATION IN OUR COUNTRY IN THE 
UNITED KINGDOM IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO PROTECT 
PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING OUT TO WAR TO 
BE SHOT IN THE NAME OF DEMOCRACY 
IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT I'VE 
NEVER COME ACROSS ANYBODY WHO IS 
HOSTILE TO THE ACTUAL PEOPLE IN THE 
ARMED WEARING THE GEAR AND NOR 
HAVE I EVER COME ACROSS A BUNCH OF 
LOUTS CHANTING AT PEOPLE BUT THIS 
IS WHAT I SAY L. DON'T THINK WE 
SHOULD HAVE LEGISLATION I THINK 
THAT IS COMPLETELY PREPOSTEROUS 
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE ALL 
THE COLONELS IN ALL THE CAMPS TO 
GET OUT THERE ON THE STREETS AND 
MARCH WITH PRIDE 
IN UNIFORM IN IN UNIFORM AND THOSE HOODIES AND 
PERHAPS IT'S HOODIES OR PERHAPS 
IT'S DISENFRANCHISED RELIGIOUS 
GROUPS GOING THROUGH BAD 
I'M SURE THEY WANT MORE I'M SURE 
THEY WANT EVERYTHING THEY'RE NOT 
HIGHLY PAID PEOPLE AND WE SHOULD 
GIVE THEM THE GREATEST CONDITIONS 
BUT THE GREATEST THING THEY CAN 
THINK OF IF THEY'RE ZERO MILES 
AWAY FIRING AGAINST AN ENEMY THAT 
NEVER SHOWS ITSELF AND LOSING THEIR 
LEGS AND ARMS BUT THEY KNOW BACK 
HOME THERE IS A SENSE OF PRIDE IN 
THEIR ACTIONS I DON'T BELIEVE THAT 
LEGISLATION FROM THIS WELL MEANING 
GUY WHO BY THE WAY SWAPPED SIDES 
JUST AS THE TIDE IS GOING OUT 
SHOULD HAVE THIS BUT THIS IS THE 
EQUIVALENT OF POLICEMEN WEARING 
UNIFORMS THAT IS WHAT THEY DO 
THEIR JOB IS TO DEFEND US AND KEEP 
DEMOCRACY SAFE IN OUR LAND AND WE 
SHOULD GIVE THEM GREAT HOUSES AND 
EVERYTHING BUT MOST OF ALL WE 
SHOULD GIVE THEM SENSE OF PRIDE 
AND A SENSE OF LOVE L. DON'T WANT 
TO SEE LEGISLATION LOVE THE 
ARMED FORCES DAY BUT I HATE THAT 
WE SHOULD MAKE IT WAR THAT PEOPLE 
SHOULD GO OUT ON THE STREETS AND 
WEAR THEIR UNIFORM WITH PRIDE IT'S 
LUDICROUS LUDICROUS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MORE FROM YOU 
LATER IN THE PROGRAMME BUT NOW 
IT'S TIME FOR OUR DAILY QUIZ TODAY 
CONCERNED WITH THE SUN 
AT THE END OF THE PROGRAMME KELVIN 
WILL GIVE US THE CORRECT ANSWER AND 
IF YOU WANT TO SEND US YOUR 
COMMENTS ABOUT ANY OF TODAY'S 
STORIES ABOUT THE ARMED FORCES DO 
GET E. MAILING 
WE'LL READ OUT SOME OF YOUR 
THOUGHTS LATER IN THE PROGRAMME 
NOW ALL EYES THIS WEEK WILL BE ON 
THE LATEST TEST OF GORDON BROWN'S 
PREMIERSHIP YES THE BY ELECTION 
IN CREWE AND NANTWICH CAUSED BY THE 
DEATH OF THE LABOUR STALL WORT 
GWYNETH DONE WEEDY AFTER THE 
CONSERVATIVES' STRONG SHOWING IN 
OTHER ELECTIONS LABOUR STRATEGISTS 
ARE ALREADY PLAYING DOWN THEIR 
PRRPTS IF DAVID CAMERON'S 
PROSPECTS IF DAVID CAMERON'S 
DOES WIN IT WOULD BE THE FIRST 
CONSERVATIVE IN THE AREA SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN 
DAVID CAMERON IS EN ROUTE THERE 
BUT BEFORE THAT HE MADE A SPEECH 
ABOUT TAXATION 
GEORGE AND I HAVE 
SAID REPEATEDLY WE BELIEVE IN LOW 
TAXES BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY'RE 
BOTH MORALLY RIGHT AND ECONOMICALLY 
EFFICIENT BUT AS WE HAVE ALSO SAID 
WE WILL NEVER TRICK INTO 
VOTING FOR US WITH THE PROMISES OF 
TAX CUTS THAT CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLY 
DELIVERED 
JOINING ME FROM THE DELIVERED CAMPAIGN ON THE BY ELECTION IS 
ERIC PICKLES DAVID CAMERON THERE 
WAS TALKING ABOUT THE 
CONSERVATIVES' POLICY ON TAXATION 
ARE THE CONSERVATIVES GOING TO CUT 
TAXES IF THEY WIN THE NEXT 
ELECTION 
WELL DAVID HAS LAID THAT ELECTION OUT WHAT THIS BY ELECTION AND OUR 
VICTORY AT LOCAL ELECTION GIVES US 
AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO IS EXACTLY 
THIS EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE OUR 
STANDING IN THE POLLS GIVES US AN 
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CONSERVATIVES 
TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND FOR 
SPEECHES LIKE TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT 
BY DAVID AND WHILST WE START TO 
FLESH THAT OUT IT GIVES US AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE ON TO POLITICS 
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T DETECT AN ANSWER 
THERE WILL THE CONSERVATIVES CUT 
TAXES IF THEY WIN THE NEXT ELECTION 
WELL YOU'VE HEARD WHAT MY LEADER 
HAS SAID AND HE LAID THAT OUT AND 
IF YOU WANT DETAILS I'M AFRAID I 
CAN'T TELL YOU BECAUSE I'M NOT 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT I'M NOT 
SHADOW CHANCELLOR BUT IF YOU WANT 
TO ASK ME SOME MORE QUESTIONS ON 
TAX I'LL DO MY BEST TO AVOID 
ANSWERING YOU BUT WHAT CAN WE DO 
FOR YOU 
SO YOU'RE AVOIDING 
ANSWERING THE QUESTION BECAUSE YOU 
DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER 
OF COURSE 
AM NOT THE SHADOW CHAR AND WHEN 
THE TIME COMES FOR US TO GIVE A 
DETAILED EXPLANATION WE WILL DO SO 
BUT WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY THE 
PROBLEM IS IF WE PRODUCE OUR TAX 
IDEAS THE CHANCELLOR WILL STEAL 
THEM WE SAW THAT HAPPEN ON 
INHERITANCE TAX AND VARIOUS THINGS 
BECAUSE THE GUY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND 
WHAT HE WAS DOING AND THAT'S WHY WE 
HAD TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY BUDGET 
BUT WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO PRODUCES 
THESE OVER THE COMING WEEKS 
I TAKE 
THE POINT THAT YOU ARE NOT THE 
CHANCELLOR BUT YOU ARE IN CHARGE 
OF THE CAMPAIGN IN THE BY ELECTION 
IN CREWE 
I AM INDEED 
SO WHAT IS 
YOUR MESSAGE FROM THE CONSERVATIVES 
ON TAX SPECIFICALLY ON THE TEN P. 
MESSAGE 
IT IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD MESSAGE WHAT WE'RE SAYING TO THE RESIDENTS 
OF CREWE IS THAT A CONSERVATIVE 
ADMINISTRATION WOULDN'T HAVE IT 
TAXED THE POOR IN ORDER TO PAY FOR 
THE POOR AND WHAT WE'VE HAD IS 
ROBIN HOOD IN REVERSE AND THERE IS 
DEEP ANGER THAT A LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
USED ITS POWERS TO TAKE MONEY FROM 
VERY POOR PEOPLE TO GIVE IT TO POOR 
PEOPLE AND THERE ARE SOMEWHERE IN 
THE REGION OF TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE STILL IN 
CREWE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN 
COMPENSATED BY THIS GOVERNMENT AND 
WHO HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN BY THIS 
GOVERNMENT AND I'M CLEAR THAT A 
CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT 
HAVE DONE THAT 
ON THE TACTICS 
YOU'RE USING IN CREWE TO TRY TO WIN 
THE BY ELECTION YOU HAVE BEEN 
ACCUSED BY LABOUR AND SOME 
COMMENTATORS OF PEDALLING A RATHER 
NEGATIVE MESSAGE ON LABOUR 
TIPIFYED BY THIS POSTER WHICH IS 
GOING AROUND AND IS IN RED TO LOOK 
LIKE LABOUR'S SAYING LABOUR'S 
GRAND THEFT ON AUTO YOU HAVE BEEN 
ACCUSED OF BEING NEGATIVE IS THAT 
FAIR 
NO I DON'T THINK IT IS EVEN FAIR BEGINNING TO BE FAIR OR EVEN IN THE 
ZONE OF NEGATIVE IF ANYONE IS 
RUNNING A NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN IT IS 
LABOUR THAT GRAND THEFT AUTO IS 
NOT A POSTER BUT A PIECE OF 
LITERATURE THAT HAS BEEN POPULAR IN 
CREWE AND NANTWICH AND WE HAVE 
BEEN STRESSING THE WORRIES THAT 
PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT THE LOCAL POST 
OFFICE AND THEIR SORTING OFFICE AND 
THE WORRIES THAT THEIR RAILWAY 
STATION MAY BE RELOCATED SO WE 
HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY POSITIVE AND 
ISLE TELL YOU FOR WHY BECAUSE 
WHEN WE COME INTO TOWN THE 
NATIONAL PARTIES WE WANT TO LEAVE 
CREWE STRONGER AND I'M AFRAID 
LABOUR'S CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN RATHER 
BASE AND NASTY AND HAS SOUGHT TO 
STIR PEOPLE UP IN A QUITE 
UNNECESSARY MANNER KELVIN KELVIN MACKENZIE IT HAS TURNED INTO A 
QUITE A FIGHT UP IN CREWE WHAT IS 
YOUR READING OF THE SITUATION OH OH I IMAGINE THE TORIES WILL ROMP 
THROUGH I KNOW CREWE AND NANTWICH 
A NATURAL LABOUR STRONGHOLD 
HOWEVER WHEN THE WIND CHANGES IN 
POLITICS IT BLOWS EVERYBODY OUT 
ASK LIVINGSTONE AND AT THE MOMENT 
THE WIND IS GOING TO BLOW LABOUR 
RIGHT OUT 
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT MR. HARD PICKLES THAT THE CONSERVATIVES ARE 
GOING TO ROMP THROUGH 
WELL WE 
COULD HAVE A VERY GOOD RESULT IF 
THE VOTERS COME OUT BUT WE COULD 
ONLY WIN IT WITH LABOUR SWITCHES 
AND WE DO KNOW THAT LABOUR 
SWITCHING IS TAKING PLACE AND THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE VOTING FOR US 
WHETHER WE HAVE ENOUGH REMAINS TO 
BE SEEN 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL 
BE TALKING TO SMINCTION ABOUT THE 
CREWE AND NANTWICH LOICTION 
TOMORROW THIS IS A FULL LIST OF 
THE CANDIDATES STANDING 
BY ELECTION MINK MINK CAMPBELL 
NOW TODAY THE THERE IS A 
DISCUSSION OVER THE HUMAN 
FERTILISATION AND EMBRYOLOGY BILL 
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS ALLOWED FREE 
VOTING ON THE BILL AFTER WORD THAT 
CATHOLICS WERE GETTING READY TO 
REBEL ON THE BILL 
IT IS THE USE OF HUMAN ANIMAL 
HYBRID EMBRYOS FOR USE IN RESEARCH 
SCIENTISTS HAVE ALREADY MADE 
ADVANCES USING EMBRYOS BUT THEY 
WANT PERMISSION TO GO FURTHER AND 
DEVELOP WHAT ARE KNOWN AS PURE 
HYBRIDS FIFTY PER CENT ANIMAL AND FIFTY PER CENT HUMAN 
RESEARCH USING ANY TYPE OF HYBRID 
WOULD BE LIMITED TO FOURTEEN DAYS AFTER 
WITCH LABORATORIES WOULD HAVE TO 
DESTROY THEM AND THEY WOULD BE 
BANNED FROM IMPLANTING THE EMBRYOS 
IN A WOMAN'S WOMB BUT OPPOSITION 
NOT LEAST FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
HAS BEEN STRONG CARDINAL KEITH 
O'BRIEN SAID THE BILL WOULD A LIEU 
EXPERIMENTS OF FRANKENSTEIN 
PROPORTION PROPORTION I SPOKE TO DAVID BUREOS A 
CONSERVATIVE M. P. BURROWS A 
CONSERVATIVE M. P.'S TO SAT ON THE 
PANEL SCRUTINISING THE BILL AND I 
STARTED BY ASKING HIM WHY HE WAS 
OPPOSED TO HYBRID EMBRYOS 
I THINK 
IT IS UNNECESSARY AND UNDESIRABLE 
IT IS FIRSTLY UNNECESSARY BECAUSE 
WE NEED TO EMBRACE STEM CELL 
RESEARCH IT IS PROVING TO HAVE A 
GREAT POTENTIAL IN THE AREA OF 
ADULT STEM CELL RESEARCH AND 
UMBILICAL CHORD CELL RESEARCH BUT 
THE HUMAN ANIMAL EMBRYOS ARE VERY 
PROBLEMATIC ON THE SCIENCE AND IS 
BE SET BY PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF 
RESEARCH THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT 
THIS RESEARCH WOULD LEAD TO RISKS 
IN RELATION TO INFECTION IMMUNE 
REACTIONS TUMOURS AND IN MANY 
WAYS UNSAFE AND DANGEROUS CLINICAL 
APPLICATIONS SO WHY NOT LET'S 
INVEST AND FOCUS ON THOSE AREAS 
THAT ARE PRODUCING RESULTS RATHER 
THAN WHAT ARE IN MANY WAYS A 
DISTRACTION IT ALSO HAS ETHICAL 
CONCERNS WHICH IS MIXING THE ISSUE 
OF ANIMAL IDENTITIES AND HUMAN 
IDENTITIES AND MY VIEW IS THAT WE 
HAVE A GOOD ETHICAL ALTERNATIVE 
AND WE SHOULD BE PROMOTING THAT 
RATHER THAN GOING DOWN WHAT IS IN 
MANY WAYS A BLIND ALLEY 
BUT MANY 
SCIENTISTS SAY YOU NEED THE HUMAN 
ANIMAL EMBRYO RESEARCH TO GO ON IN 
ORDER TO FIND CURES FOR THINGS LIKE 
PARKINSON'S AND MOTOR NEURONE 
DISEASE ARE YOU NOT STANDING IN 
THE WAY OF PROGRESS 
NO IN MANY 
WAYS I FEEL IT IS TAKING US 
BACKWARDS IN THE WAY THAT THE WORLD 
OUT THERE IS LOOKING IN OTHER 
DEVELOPMENTS WE ARE FIRST IN THE 
WORLD OVER UMBILICAL CORD RESEARCH 
IN A DRAFT BILL WE'RE NOT ABLE TO 
COME UP WITH THE SCIENTIFIC 
EXPERIMENTS OR THE RESEARCH THEY 
COULD BASE IT ON TO SAY THIS IS NOW 
GOING TO LEAD TO TREATMENT AND 
THERAPUTIC VALUE IT IS SPECULATIVE 
AND AN AREA WE DON'T NEED TO GO 
DOWN WE CAN USE THE WONDERFUL 
RESEARCH IN OTHER AREAS 
HOW MUCH SUPPORT DO YOU HAVE ARE 
YOU CONFIDENT THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE 
TO DEFEAT THIS PART OF THE BILL 
WELL IT'S HARD TO KNOW IT IS A 
FREE VOTE MANY MEMBERS ARE KEEPING 
THEIR CARDS CLOSE TO THEIR CHEST SO 
WE DON'T KNOW UNTIL THE VOTE TAKES 
PLACE MY HUNCH IS THAT MANY 
MEMBERS WILL BE PARTICULARLY 
CONCERNED TO LIMIT THE EXTENT OF 
THIS HYBRID EMBRYO THEY WILL BE 
PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
APPLICATION TO FULL HYBRIDS THE 
MIXING OF HUMAN SPERM AND ANIMAL 
EGGS AND VICE VERSA NO SCIENTIST 
HAS BEEN ABLE TO SAY THIS HAS ANY 
THERAPEUTIC VALUE THERE MAY BE 
SOME EXTRA LIMITATIONS ON THE 
GROUND WHETHER LEAD TO AN 
OUTRIGHT BAN IS OPEN TO QUESTION 
I'M JOINED NOW BY THE DIRECTOR OF 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AT THE 
PARKINSON'S DISEASE SOCIETY DOCTOR 
KIERAN BREEN YOU HEARD THE 
ARGUMENTS THERE ANIMAL HUMAN 
HYBRIDS ARE UNNECESSARY AND 
UNDESIRABLE 
IF YOU CONSIDER STEM UNDESIRABLE CELL RESEARCH AS BEING A JIGSAW 
PUZZLE AND ONE YOU CAN HAVE ADULT 
STEM CELLS YOU CAN HAVE EMBRYONIC 
STEM CELLS AND STEM CELLS DEVELOPED 
FROM HYBRIDS EACH OF THOSE WILL 
TELL US SOMETHING DIFFERENT WE 
HOPE TO COMBINE THE INFORMATION WE 
GET WE KNOW THAT ADULT STEM CELLS 
ARE VERY GOOD AT MAKING MUSCLE 
CELLS THAT CAN BE TRANSPLANTED INTO 
THE HEART WE KNOW THAT ADULT STEM 
CELLS ARE NOT AS PLIABLE AS 
EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS THERE IS NO 
EVIDENCE THAT WE CAN GET ADULT 
STEM CELLS TO MAKE EMBRYONIC STEM 
CELLS HOW YO GO FROM A STEM CELL 
TO A NERVE CELL THEN WE CAN 
POSSIBLY ADAPT THAT INFORMATION TO 
ADULT STEM CELLS AND TRANSFORM THEM 
INTO THE NERVE CELLS THAT MAY BE 
USED IN TRANSPLANTATION TO GIVE 
HOPE TO ULTIMATELY GIVE A CURE FOR 
THOSE WITH PARKINSON'S 
YOU WOULD 
ARGUE THAT HUMAN ANIMAL HYBRIDS 
OFFER A UNIQUE WAY OF CONDUCTING 
RESEARCH IF IT GETS OVERTURNED 
HOW WOULD THAT AFFECT YOUR RESEARCH 
AND POSSIBLE CURES FOR DISEASES 
OBVIOUSLY WHAT WE ARE ASKING M. P.'S 
TO CONSIDER IS THAT ALL AVENUES OF 
RESEARCH BE KEPT OPEN BECAUSE THEY 
ARE ALL COMPLIMENTARY TO EACH OTHER 
IF ONE OR MORE AVENUE IS CUT OFF 
WE ARE MISSING SOME INFORMATION AND 
IT MAY TAKE US LONGER TO GET TO OUR 
AIM OF FINDING A WAY OF 
TRANSPLANTING CELLS TO IDENTIFY 
CURE FOR CONDITIONS SUCH AS 
PARKINSON'S 
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND PARKINSON'S PEOPLE'S CONCERNS ON THE ETHICAL 
SIDE ABOUT MIXING ANIMAL AND HUMAN 
CELLS EVEN IF YOU REASSURE US THAT 
IT WILL BE DESTROYED WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS 
TO MANY PEOPLE IT DOES SOUND 
EXTREMELY STRANGE 
WE CAN 
APPRECIATE THAT OBVIOUSLY 
EVERYBODY INCLUDING THE MEMBERS OF 
PARLIAMENT HAVE TO MAKE UP THEIR 
OWN MINDS WHEN THEY HAVE ALL THE 
FACTS AVAILABLE TO THEM TAKE FOR 
EXAMPLE THE HYBRIDS THE ONES THAT 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ONES WHERE 
YOU TAKE AN EMPTY EGGSHELL FROM AN 
ANIMAL AND YOU INJECT HUMAN D. N. A. 
THIS IS THEN GROWN IN A DISH AND 
THIS WILL PROVIDE US WITH STEM 
CELLS FROM WHICH WE CAN MAKE HUMAN 
NERVE CELLS WILL BE ONLY BE USED 
AS A TOOL TO UNDERSTAND HOW STEM 
CELLS TRANSFORM INTO NERVE CELLS 
BUT THAT ENOUGH THAT ALONE IS 
ENOUGH TO MAKE SOME PEOPLE THINK 
THAT IT'S DANGEROUS TO GO DOWN THAT 
PATH KELVIN WHERE DO YOU STAND ON 
THIS 
IF ANY OF YOUR VIEWERS HAVE THIS RELATIVES SUFFERING FROM 
ALZHEIMER'S I WILL BE SAYING 
BRING IT ON AND THE OTHER WAY TO 
CHECK AGAINST THESE ARGUMENTS IS TO 
FIND OUT WHO IS ON THE OTHER SIDE 
AND WHEN YOU FIND OUT THAT IT'S 
RELIGIOUS GROUPS ON THE OTHER SIDE 
WHO ARE GUIDED BY SOMETHING OUT 
THERE WHICH THEY CAN'T DEFINE 
PROPERLY YOU SAY I'M ON THE 
RIGHT SIDE OF THIS ARGUMENT I 
WILL ALWAYS BE VERY WARY OF 
RELIGION WHEN IT IS PRESSING 
AGAINST ADVANCE MEDICAL OR 
SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGHS 
IS THIS 
THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU AND YOUR 
FELLOW SCIENTISTS THE ANIMAL HUMAN 
HYBRIDS IS THIS THE ONLY WAY YOU 
ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIND CURES 
THIS IS ONE WAY IN WHICH WE CAN 
HELP TO UNDERSTAND STEM CELLS AND 
NERVE CELLS 
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS 
BUT NOT 
FOR CERTAIN DISEASES NOT NOT FOR CERTAIN DISEASES ADULT STEM 
CELLS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY PLIABLE 
AT THE MOMENT AS WE UNDERSTAND THEM 
TO MAKE NERVE CELLS SO WE NEED TO 
INVESTIGATE ALL AREAS 
WE ALREADY 
HAD ONE HUMAN ANIMAL HYBRID JOHN 
PRESCOTT 
I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO PRESCOTT SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
NOT MANY 
OF YOUR VIEWERS WILL DISAGREE WITH 
THAT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT JOINING US TIME FOR A COUPLE OF 
YOUR E. MAILS SIMON SMITH TALKING 
ABOUT THE PROPOSALS FOR QUENTIN 
DAVIES CADETS IN STATE SCHOOLS 
SOUNDS LIKE THE CANNON FODDER FOR 
FUTURE WARS L. WAS A MEMBER OF THE 
ROYAL NAVY FOR SIX YEARS AND THE 
ARMED FORCES SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO 
WEAR THEIR UNIFORM WITH PRIDE AND 
RESPONSIBILITY HARRY SAYS NO 
WONDER SOLDIERS DO NOT HAVE PRIDE 
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN THIS 
COUNTRY WERE AGAINST THE WAR IN 
IRAQ NOW IF YOU ARE A DRIVER YOU 
WILL KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS TO 
RUN A CAR TOT UP ROAD TAX 
INSURANCE THE COST OF PETROL AND 
YOU ARE LOOKING AT A LARGE SLAB OF 
HOUSEHOLD INCOME THINGS ARE ABOUT 
TO GET MORE EXPENSIVE FOR MOTORISTS 
IN NOTTINGHAM ITS CITY COUNCIL HAS 
BECOME THE FIRST LOCAL AUTHORITY TO 
IMPOSE A TAX ON COMPANY CAR PARKING 
SPACES ALL BUSINESSES WITH MORE 
THAN TEN SPACES ARE GOING TO HAVE 
TO PAY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE PER SPACE RISING TO 
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY WITHIN SIX YEARS ANNE 
ALEXANDER HAS BEEN TO NOTTINGHAM TO 
FIND OUT MORE NOTTINGHAM CITY 
CENTRE DURING THE LUNCH TIME RUSH 
THE CARS ARE BUMPER TO BUMPER AS 
YOU CAN SEE IT IS BUSY HERE AND A 
LOT OF THE MOTORISTS WOULD HAVE 
DRIVEN INTO WORK THE LOCAL COUNCIL 
IS HOPING THAT ITS NEW SCHEME WILL 
HELP STOP THE TRAFFIC 
WE WILL BE 
RAISING A LEVY OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE A YEAR ON 
EVERY FIRM IN THE CITY WHICH HAS 
MORE THAN TEN PARKING SPACES ALL 
THAT MONEY WILL BE PUT INTO A FUND 
AND THEN SPENT ON TRANSPORT TO 
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE OFF ROADS THIS THIS EXTRA TAX WAS NEVER EXACTLY GOING 
TO BE WELCOMED 
SOME TIMES YOU HAVE 
TO MAKE HARD DECISIONS WE KNOW 
THAT IT IS NOT THE MOST POPULAR 
THING WE HAVE EVER DONE NOBODY 
LIKES TAXES IF YOU DON'T DO 
SOMETHING THEN PEOPLE WILL BLAME 
YOU RETROSPECTIVELY SO YOU CAN'T 
WIN 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT HAVING WIN SHIED AWAY FROM A NATIONAL ROAD 
PRICING SCHEME INSTEAD PUTTING THE 
ONUS ON COUNCILS TO SET UP LOCAL 
PROJECTS NOTTINGHAM CITY COUNCIL 
WILL TAKE THE POLITICAL FLAK FOR 
THIS MEASURE BUT IT IS HOPING THE 
BENEFITS BETTER PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
USING THE ESTIMATED TWELVE MILLION IT 
WILL SOFTEN THE BLOW A SERIES OF 
BUSES WILL BE EXPANDED THIS ONE 
GOES OUT TO ONE OF MAIN TRADING 
ESTATES THERE WILL ALSO BE MORE 
BUSES THE MAIN BENEFICIARY WILL BE 
THE CITY'S TRAM SYSTEM WHICH WILL 
GET A NEW LINE THANKS TO SOME OF 
THE CASH RAISED FROM THE SCHEME 
THESE TRAM USERS HAVE CONCERNS 
ABOUT THE TAX 
I THINK THE TRAM IS 
BRILLIANT AND I WOULDN'T DRIVE INTO 
TOWN AT ALL L. SUPPOSE PEOPLE THAT 
WORK IN TOWN IF THEY HAVE GOT A 
PLACE TO PARK I CAN UNDERSTAND 
THEM NOT BEING VERY HAPPY 
I DON'T 
DRIVE MYSELF L. CAN FEEL FOR THE 
DRIVERS BUT ANYTHING THAT WILL 
REDUCE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AND 
STOP THE CONGESTION IS A GOOD IDEA 
IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THE PEOPLE THAT 
LIVE IN THE SOUTH TO GET INTO WORK 
AND I KNOW THE BUS SYSTEM CAN BE 
BIT DIFFICULT TO USE I'M LUCKY 
BECAUSE I LIVE IN THE NORTH OF 
NOTTINGHAM AND CAN GET THE TRAM 
SHYING AWAY FROM RADICAL ACTION IS 
SIMPLY NOT AN OPTION SAYS 
COUNCILLOR CHAPMAN 
AS YOU CAN SEE 
THERE'S QUITE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT 
OF CONGESTION BECAUSE NOTTINGHAM IS 
EXPANDING AND THERE IS CONGESTION 
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING IT WILL 
GET WORSE THIS INVESTMENT HAS 
BE MADE NOW BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE 
ANNE ALEXANDER KELVIN MACKENZIE 
WAS WATCHING THAT WITH ME AND HE 
STOOD IN THE RECENT LOCAL ELECTIONS 
AS AN INDEPENDENT CAMPAIGNER 
AGAINST HIGH PARKING COSTS I'M 
GUESSING YOU DON'T AGREE WITH 
NOTTINGHAM CITY COUNCIL 
THIS IS 
JUST TAX RAISING BY ANOTHER MEANS 
WHAT IF IT IS RINGFENCED THEY WILL 
SPEND IT ON THE LOCAL TRAM SERVICE 
THAT IS WHAT THEY SAY IT WON'T 
WORK OUT LIKE THAT YES WE NEED A 
PARK OVER HERE WE NEED A BIT OF 
DUSTBINS OVER HERE THE IDEA THAT 
IT WILL BE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY IN SIX YEARS AND IN 
SIXTEEN YEARS IT WILL BE THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED LIT 
MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO THE 
CONGESTION IN NOTTINGHAM THEY ARE 
CLOBBERING A MASSIVELY EASY TARGET 
WHICH THIS LABOUR GOVERNMENT ARE 
FINGERED AS THEIR NEW WAY OF 
RAISING TAXES SO IT'S A DISGRACE 
IT WON'T WORK IT DIDN'T WORK IN 
LONDON THE CARS ARE GOING SLOWER 
TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE BUT THERE'S 
TENS OF MILLIONS COMING IN FOR MAD 
LEFT OF CENTRE COUNCILS TO SPEND 
SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE ABOUT 
CONGESTION HOW DO YOU TACKLE IT 
WE HAVE INVENTED THE CAR PUT THE 
PRESSURE ON THE ENGINE 
MANUFACTURERS TO COME UP WITH CLEAN 
CARS 
YOU WILL STILL BE SITTING IN CARS A TRAFFIC JAM 
SO YOU TAKE LONGER 
TO GET TO WORK OR YOU COME IN 
EARLIER OR YOU GO LATER THE IDEA 
THAT CONGESTION THIS IS WHY I LOVE 
EDINBURGH THEY SAID I DON'T WANT 
TO PAY SIX A DAY BUT THANK YOU FOR 
ASKING 
IF ANDREW WAS HERE HE ASKING WOULD HAVE A GO AT THAT 
I KNOW 
ANDREW HE DOES A VERY GOOD 
IMPERSONATION OF A SCOT THEY HAVE 
JUST GONE POWER MAD THESE LOCAL 
COUNCILS THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO 
RAISE TAX REVENUES THAT IS WHAT IT 
BOILS DOWN TO SO THEY ARE SAYING 
JOLLY GOOD IF YOU TAKE THE THING 
THAT DROVE ME MAD MY LOCAL COUNCIL 
COVERS A VERY POSH AREA OF 
WEYBRIDGE ONE DAY I PUT MY MONEY 
INTO THE CAR PARKING IT IS BY THE 
STATION THAT IS WHERE THEY PARK 
YOUR CAR THEY SAY IT USED TO COST 
YOU THREE A DAY SO FROM APRIL FIRST I 
WENT ABSOLUTELY MAD NO 
I WENT NO MAD I DECIDED I'M GOING TO VOTE 
OUT THE GUY LOCALLY WHO VOTED FOR 
IT WHAT HAPPENED L. L. BEAT THE LIB 
ZEMS BUT THE TORY GOT IT LIB 
DEMS BUT THE TORY GOT IT 
SO PEOPLE 
DIDN'T SUPPORT YOU 
I ONLY HAD 
THREE WEEKS TO THE ELECTION I 
PRINTED MY LEAFLETS HAD I REALLY 
GONE FOR IT I WOULD STILL HAVE GOT 
BEATEN BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
CLOSER THAT IS THE TRUTH THE 
REALITY IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAVE 
ALLOWED CAR PARKING TO BE A 
UNIQUELY LOCAL THING AND THE OLE 
COUNCILLORS SAID WE HAVE A BIT OF 
POWER AT LAST WE WILL BE ABLE TO 
CLOBBER SOMEBODY IT DOESN'T WORK 
EITHER 
AS MUCH AS I WOULD LOVE TO EITHER CONTINUE WE MUST FIND OUT THE 
ANSWER TO OUR QUIZ WE MUST MOVE ON 
THERE IS TIME BEFORE WE GO TO FIND 
OUT THE ANSWER THE QUESTION WAS 
REGRETTABLY IT HAPPENED BEFORE I 
BECAME THE EDITOR IT WAS NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND 
SIR LARRY LAMB 
DO YOU MISS IT I'M I'M STILL A COLUMNIST EVERY THURSDAY 
YOU SHOULD READ IT 
IS IT ABOUT 
PARKING 
I DON'T MISS EDITING WE PARKING WE MUST LEAVE IT THERE THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH FOR JOINING US THAT IS IT FOR 
TODAY ANDREW AND I WILL BE BACK 
TOMORROW AT NOON FOR MORE DAILY 
POLITICS WE WILL BE JOINED BY 
MENZIES CAMPBELL SEE YOU THEN 
BYE BYE
