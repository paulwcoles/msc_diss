THE SNOW FRIENDS 
NOT MANY SMALL PIGS LIKE READING 
BUT LITTLE PIG DID 
HE LIVED QUIETLY ON THE EDGE OF THE WOOD UNDER A BIG OAK TREE 
HE HAD PLENTY OF ACORNS AND TWIGS AND 
BOOKS 
AND FOR A LONG TIME THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR HIM 
THEN ONE DAY 
HE FOUND THREE NEW WORDS IN A BOOK 
WISH WAS ONE 
WELL THAT WAS EASY 
THE NEXT WAS HARDER IT WAS CHANGE

THE LAST WAS HARDEST IT WAS 
FRIEND 
LITTLE PIG CLOSED HIS EYES AND TRIED THE WORDS OUT 
I WISH FOR A CHANGE 
AND A FRIEND HE SAID TO HIMSELF 
THE WISH WORKED IT STARTED TO SNOW 
AND THAT WAS A NICE CHANGE 
SO LITTLE PIG TOOK SOME ACORNS AND SOME TWIGS 
AND SOME SNOW 
AND HE MADE A FRIEND 
LET'S GO O. O. O. SAID THE SNOW FRIEND 
AND OFF THEY WENT UNTIL THEY CAME TO AN IGLOO 
IT WAS THE HOME OF A LONELY BIRD
