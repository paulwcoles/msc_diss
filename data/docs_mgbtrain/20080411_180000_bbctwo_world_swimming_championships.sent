CHAMPION 
THIS IS THE STRONGEST BRITISH TEAM 
WE HAVE EVER HAD WE ARE PROVING 
ARE ONE OF THE BEST NATIONS 
IN THE WORLD WE ARE GOING TO ROCK 
BEIJING 
THAT FEELING OF CONFIDENCE BEIJING SHOWN BY REBECCA ADLINGTON AND LIAM 
TANCOCK IS DEFINITELY INFECTIOUS 
THE BRITISH TEAM IS FLYING HIGH 
THIRD IN THE MEDALS TABLE AT THE 
HALFWAY STAGE OF THE WORLD SHORT 
COURSE CHAMPIONSHIPS WITH THREE 
GOLD MEDALS SO FAR WE COULD BE 
ADDING TO THAT TITLE TONIGHT AND 
THIS IS WHY WE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO 
MARK FOSTER THEY ARE FANTASTIC IN 
A CAREER SPANNING TWENTY YEARS HE HAS 
WON HIS SIX WORLD SHORT COURSE 
TITLES HE COULD GET ANOTHER 
TONIGHT AT THE AGE OF THIRTY SEVEN FRAN 
HALSALL WILL BE EIGHTEEN TOMORROW SHE IS

BEST CHANCE OF A GOLD MEDAL AT

MEDLEY RELAY YOU ARE PADDED UP I I HAD TO SHAVE IN HOMAGE TO OUR 
SWIMMERS 
HOW MANY GOLD MEDALS THAT SWIMMERS WE GET 
WE ARE RAIN A WONDERFUL 
PLACE FOR MANY OPPORTUNITIES YOU 
HAVE NOT INCLUDED CHRIS GILCHRIST 
AND ELIZABETH SIMMONDS AND THEY ARE 
REAL MEDAL CONTENDERS BUT AS 
PEOPLE THAT MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE L. 
WILL BE SURPRISED IF THEY DO NOT 
GET GOLD SILVER OR BRONZE WE WILL 
GET FOUR OR FIVE MEDALS AND THE 
QUESTION IS WHETHER ANY WILL BE 
GOLD 
THESE SWIMMERS ARE LIFTED BY GOLD THE CROWD BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE 
PEOPLE IN HERE TONIGHT THEN THERE 
HAVE BEEN SO FAR THEY ARE MAKING A 
LOT OF NOISE AND ANDREW JAMIESON 
HAS TO CONTEND WITH THAT TALKING 
ABOUT MARK FOSTER HOW CAN YOU PUT 
INTO CONTEXT WHAT HE HAS ACHIEVED 
IN A TO BE AS HIGH AS HE DOES AT 
HIS AGE 
IT IS ABSOLUTELY 
UNPARALLELED IN WORLD SWIMMING HE 
WILL BE THIRTY EIGHT AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
HIS FIFTH HE IS IN SUCH GREAT SHAPE 
FOR A THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD WITH THE SPEED 
THAT HE HAS GOT HE COULD STILL WIN 
THE FINAL

FOSTER SO GOOD IN SHORT COURSE POOL 
HE IS SIX BUT SIX AND AFTER THIRTY EIGHT POOL YEARS HE HAS AMASSED A LOT OF 
EXPERIENCE HE HAS WON MEDALS AT 
ALL MAJOR CHAMPIONSHIPS ARE BARRED 
FROM THE OLYMPIC GAMES AND THAT IS 
THE ONE MEDAL THAT HE WANTS TO 
FINISH HIS CAREER APART FROM 
STRAIGHT INTO THIS FIRST RACE 
MATTHEW CLAY IN LANE THREE LIAM 
TANCOCK IN NUMBER FOUR PETER 
MARSHALL AND STANISLAV DONETS IN 
THE SIX THIS WILL BE A VERY FAST 
SEMI FINAL THERE IS STANISLAV 
DONETS I THINK HE WAS PARTICULARLY 
DISAPPOINTED TO HAVE LOST THAT ONE HUNDRED M. 
BACKSTROKE NOW MATTHEW CLAY HE IS 
COMMONWEALTH CHAMPION AT THE FIFTY M. 
BACKSTROKE WHEN HE DID IT WAS 
SHOCK TO OTHER PEOPLE MAYBE NOT 
HIM BUT QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WERE 
CHEESED OFF THIS GUY IS BRILLIANT 
UNDER WATER PETER MARSHALL YOU 
ARE ALLOWED FIFTY M. OF THE START IT IS 
ONLY FIFTY M. RACE SO UNDER WATER 
CAN BE DONE NOW LIAM TANCOCK 
WORLD RECORD HOLDER AT THIS EVENT 
IN THE LONG COURSE POOL THAT IS A 
ONE LENGTH DASH IN OUT LONG COURSE 
POOL HERE YOU HAVE TO TURN AROUND 
HE HAS BEEN GREAT 
YES HE IS A 
VERY GOOD LONG COURSE SWIMMER AT FIFTY 
WINNING THE WORLD TITLE THE 
CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE TO HOLD 
THEM OFF PETER MARSHALL IS 
FANTASTIC AS YOU SAID LIAM 
TANCOCK IS A REAL REVELATION HE 
HAS MANAGED TO GO UP IN DISTANCE 
AND DO SOME FANTASTIC ONE HUNDRED M. SWIMS 
THAT SHOWS HOW T. AND STRONG HE IS 
READY FOR THE OLYMPIC YEAR AS ARE 
MANY OF THE TEAM IT IS GREAT TO 
SEE HIM HAVE HIS CONFIDENCE HE 
WILL GO INTO THE OLYMPICS OR WORLD 
TITLE HOLDER HE BROKE THE WORLD RECORD ON THE 
FIFTY M. LONG COURSE BY THREE TENTHS OF 
A SECOND GREAT BRITAIN REPRESENTED BY 
MATTHEW CLAY IN THREE AND LIAM 
TANCOCK IN FOUR LIAM TANCOCK HAS 
HAD A GREAT START THE WORLD RECORD 
IS SOLD BY THOMAS RUPPRATH IN THE 
SECOND SEMI FINAL IS HELD BY I THINK LIAM TANCOCK GOT THE TOUCH 
HE DID THE TIME IS JUST OUTSIDE 
THE WORLD RECORD BUT IT IS NEW 
BRITISH RECORD FOR LIAM TANCOCK 
ANOTHER TWO TENTHS OF A SECOND A 
COMMONWEALTH RECORD AS WELL A A FANTASTIC SWIMMER BY LIAM TANCOCK 
EVERYTHING HE DOES LONG GAUZY IS 
REPEATING SHORT COURSE ONE MORE 
SWIM FOR THE FINAL LONG COURSE SUCH FANTASTIC STREAMLINING THAT 
IS THE MODEL OF HOW TO DO IT AND 
THEN UP QUICKLY THAT WAS SUPER 
CAMERA SHOT BECAUSE YOU COULD SEE 
THE STREAMLINING THE TONE IS GOOD 
PETER MARSHALL WENT DEEPER WHICH 
HELPED HIM THE TURN IS GOOD IT 
IS UNUSUAL TO SEE SOMEBODY PULLING 
AWAY IT DID NOT OPEN A BIG GAP BUT 
HE DID BEAT PETER MARSHALL IN THE 
LAST TEN OR FIFTEEN METRES LIAM TANCOCK 
HAS WON THE FIRST SEMI FINAL 
MATTHEW CLAY WAS SIXTH IN TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETY SIX THOSE TIMES 
ARE REALLY GOOD CONGRATULATIONS EVERY TIME YOU GET ARE YOU THAT WAS 
PRETTY GOOD YEAH YEAH PRETTY GOOD EVERY TIME YOU GET 
IN THE WATER WE EXPECT SOMETHING 
PRETTY GOOD ARE YOU

PRETTY GOOD 
I HAVE THE MEDLEY IN 
THE AFTERNOON AND I AM LOOKING 
FORWARD TO THAT AS WELL 
ARE YOU 
LOOKING TO BREAK THE WORLD RECORD 
I WILL BE CLOSE BUT WE WILL SEE 
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FINAL YOU HAVE 
TO GET ALL THE SKILLS RIGHT YOU 
HAVE TO GET STARTS TURNS FINISHES 
STROKE RATE HOLD THE WATER IF IT 
ALL GOES WELL MAYBE BUT WHO KNOWS 
ALL RIGHT L. KNOW YOU HAVE THE TWO HUNDRED 
MEDLEY COMING UP AND WE ARE LOOKING 
FORWARD TO THAT THAT WAS TIED YES YES I'LL HAVE TO WATCH THAT SEMI FINAL 
TIGHT 
I AM NOT TOO HOPEFUL THAT 
WE WILL SEE HOW IT GOES FINGERS FINGERS CROSSED A VERY FAST SECOND SEMI FINAL HERE 
IN TWO IS THE WORLD CHAMPION LONG 
COURSE IF FOUR IS THE WORLD 
CHAMPION FROM TWO THOUSAND ONE AND IN SIX IS 
THE WORLD RECORD HOLDER THIS IS 
ALBERT SUBIRATS OF VENEZUELA HE 
WAS FOURTH TWO YEARS AGO WEARING A 
NOSE BUT YOU DO NOT SEE THAT VERY 
OFTEN RANDALL BAL WAS WORLD 
CHAMPION IN TWO THOUSAND ONE STILL VERY FAST 
IN HIS TIME JUST OUTSIDE THE WORLD 
RECORD BUT HE DID NOT HAD A VERY 
GOOD FINISH THEM PERHAPS HE WILL 
GET IT TODAY WHEN YOU GO ON YOUR BACK IT IS NICE 
TO HAVE A NOSE CLIP SOME SWIMMERS 
DO NOT NEED IT THE SECOND SEMI FINAL LIAM TANCOCK WON IT RANDALL BAL GOT SILVER ON THE BACKSTROKE CAN HE GET THE GOLD THEY HAVE TO BREAK THE SERVICE 
AFTER FIFTEEN METRES JUST ABOUT PERFECT 
FROM ALL OF THEM SERVICE 
AMERICANS ARE GENERALLY VERY GOOD 
ON STARTS AND TURNS THEY ARE FAST UNDER WATER THAN ON TOP THIS IS EXTREMELY CLOSE I SAID THE WIN A GOOD COME FROM 
ANYWHERE RANDALL BAL GOT IT 
SLIGHTLY SLOWER THAN I THOUGHT 
THOMAS RUPPRATH WORLD RECORD 
HOLDER WAS SECOND HOW CLOSE WAS 
THAT 
MOST OF THAT SEMI FINAL THAT QUALIFIED SIX OF THEM SO ONLY 
LIAM TANCOCK AND PETER MARSHALL 
FROM THE FIRST HEAT WENT FASTER 
BUT THE TOP SIX WILL ALL GO THROUGH 
I THOUGHT RANDALL BAL LOOKED RUSTY 
THE SILVER MEDAL TOOK MORE OUT OF 
PAINT THAT LIAM TANCOCK HE WILL BE 
VERY P. C. GO INTO THE FINAL WITH THE 
FASTEST TIME VERY PLEASED 
FARMERS REPAIR ONLY FLEW IN 
YESTERDAY AND IS GOING HOME TO 
GERMANY TOMORROW THOMAS RUPPRATH 
I DO NOT THINK HE WILL GET ANY 
MEDALS TOMORROW FAMOUS LAST NO PLACE FOR MATTHEW CLAY BUT THAT 
IS WHAT IS KNOWN AS MAKING A SPLASH 
DOING THAT AT THE SHORT COURSE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS IS FRANCESCA HALSALL 
SHE IS IN THE FORM OF HER LIFE SHE 
DOES THIS WHEN SHE DOES SO RACES I I HAVE BEEN TOLD TO GET IN AND ENJOY 
IT I KNOW I HAVE SWUM FASTER AND 
THEN A LOT OF PREPARATION THIS IS 
A SHORT COURSE AND I HAVE BEEN 
TRAINING SHORT COURSE L. AM LOOKING 
FORWARD TO GETTING IN ALL THE 
INTERNATIONAL SIMMERS AND ALL MY 
FRIENDS AND FAMILY MY ONE HUNDRED 
FREESTYLE WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTING 
AT THE TRIALS SO I WANT TO GET IN 
AND PROVE TO MYSELF THAT I AM A ONE HUNDRED 
FREESTYLE SWIMMER NONE OF THIS 
BUTTERFLY BUSINESS L. AM GOING TO 
SWIM FASTER MY MAIN EVENTS THIS 
WEEK IN MY MAIN EVENTS APART FROM MARLENE VIEWED HE SAYS THIS IS VERY FAST RACE 
THIS IS A VERY FAST RACE MARLEEN VELDHUIS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT 
NOBODY WILL GET NEAR HER A STRONG AND CONFIDENT SWIMMER THAT 
HAS BEEN AROUND FOR WHILE ALICE 
MILLS WILL WALKOUT LATER FROM 
AUSTRALIA IN LANE FIVE SHE HAS GOT 
FORM AND SO HAS HANNA MARIA 
SEPPALLA CHAMPION FROM SEVEN YEARS 
AGO COMING BACK INTO FANTASTIC 
FORM I THINK FRAN HALSALL COULD 
GET THIS IT IS GREAT EXPERIENCE 
FOR HER 
FASTEST QUALIFIER IN A 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL WILL 
CERTAINLY MAKE HER EXTRAORDINARILY 
NERVOUS BUT SHE IS VERY GOOD AT 
DEALING WITH THE NERVES IT WILL BE 
VERY USEFUL FOR HER WHEN SHE GOES 
INTO BEIJING 
YOU ARE RIGHT IT IS 
A STRONG FIELD ALL THESE WOMEN ARE 
A FEW YEARS OLDER THAN HER L. DO 
NOT THINK SHE NEEDS THOSE GLOVES ON 
IT IS BOILING NOW FRAN HALSALL WHAT CAN YOU DO 
SHE HAS HER HAT AND GOGGLES ON 
ALREADY A LOT OF THESE SWIMMERS 
KEEP TOPS ON THAT THEY HAVE TO TAKE 
OVER THEIR HEAD L. WOULD PROBABLY 
USED A ZIP BECAUSE WHEN YOU TAKE 
IT OVER YOUR HEAD IT KNOCKS YOUR 
HAT OFF LOOK AT ALL THE OTHER 
SWIMMERS 
THE PERSON IN THE FAST AS SWIMMERS LANE THEY WALK OUT THEY RUSH THEM 
AND THEN ALL THE OTHER SWIMMERS ARE 
READY HOLD THEM UP DO WHAT YOU 
HAVE GOT TO DO THEY WILL WAIT 
THEY ARE WAITING THEY ARE WAITING 
FOR FRAN HOW SALT AND THAT IS THE 
RIGHT THING TO DO FAN HALSALL FRAN HALSALL OF GREAT BRITAIN IS IN THE CENTRE THE AMERICANS ARE VERY VERY GOOD FRAN HALSALL AND NEEDS TO WORK THIS LENGTH 
SHE IS WELL PLACED AT THE LENGTH MOMENT FRAN HALSALL IS IN A GREATER MEDAL 
POSITION HALSALL GETS THE SILVER 
A GREAT SWIM FROM HER L. THINK TO 
BE HONEST THAT IS THE BEST YOU 
COULD HAVE EXPECTED 
YES MORE 
HOPEFUL THAN REALISTIC THE DUTCH 
GOAL TOOK THE FIELD APART SHE GOT 
OUT OF THE BLOCKS AND INTO HER 
STROKE AND NEVER LOOKED BACK FRAN 
HALSALL BATTLED WITH THE REST OF 
THE FIELD SHE WAS UP QUITE QUICK WE SAW MARK 
FOSTER DO THAT WE KNOW IT IS QUICK 
SPENDING TIME UNDERWATER BUT IN A 
SPRINT FREESTYLE MARK FOSTER HAS 
DECIDED YOU CAN GET A QUICKER 
MANY CONGRATULATIONS PROBABLY 
ALMOST INDIVIDUAL MEDAL YET 
IT IS 
AMAZING I AM SO HAPPY 
IT WAS 
SO 
WAVEY TO NICE IN THEIR 
YOU HAD A 
GREAT SECOND HALF TO THE RACE YES YES I KNOW IN THE HEATS IN THE SEMI 
FINALS I HAD A LITTLE BIT LEFT TO 
GIVE IT WITH MY LEGS L. TURNED IT 
ON TONIGHT AND PRODUCED A GOOD SWIM 
I YOUR FAMILY HERE 
MY FAMILY AND 
FRIENDS ARE S. A. T. OVER THERE IT IS 
AMAZING WALKING OUT IT IS SO NICE 
IT IS YOUR EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY TOMORROW 
AND THAT IS GREAT BIRTHDAY 
PRESENT WHAT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY 
CELEBRATION 
I AM GOING TO PARIS CELEBRATION NEXT WEEK FOR A BIT OF SHOPPING 
AFTER ALL THE SWIMMING IT IS NICE 
TO HAVE A REST ON MY BIRTHDAY SO THE SEMI FINAL OF THE MEN'S FIFTY M. 
BUTTERFLY MARC FOSTER IS IN LANE 
EIGHT I AM SURPRISED HE IS 
SWIMMING THIS HE LOOKED VERY TIRED 
AFTER HIS HEAT SWIM MATTHEW BOW IS 
IN LANE ONE MATTHEW BOWL ADRIAN ARE YOU SURPRISED WITH 
FOSTER BEING IN THIS 
YES AT THIRTY SEVEN 
CAN HE DO TWO FIFTY M. IN THE SAME 
EVENING THE FREESTYLE IS THE MOST 
IMPORTANT TO HIM TO REGAIN A WORLD 
TITLE HE HAS OVER AN HOUR TO REST 
IN BETWEEN HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO 
COPE EVEN THOUGH HE IS THIRTY SEVEN 
HE WAS 
BLOWING A LOT AFTER THE HEAT AND 
THE HAS THIS GREAT CHANCE TO BECOME 
FIVE TIME WORLD COURSE CHAMPION 
THIS GUY IS QUICK FOSTER HAS AN OUTSIDE LANE SO IF 
YOU COULD CHOOSE I THINK IN SHORT 
COURSE WERE THE BIG WAVES COMES 
FROM THE TERM I WOULD CHOOSE AN 
OUTSIDE LANE AND THE BRITS ON THE 
TO OUTSIDE LANES 
THAT WILL BE 
INTERESTING I THINK ADAM PINE WILL 
GO QUICKLY FOSTER LOOKS UP FOR IT FOSTER CLOSEST TO US WITH THE BLUE HAT ON HE IS NORMALLY A VERY GOOD STARTER FOSTER'S STROKE IS QUITE SHORT HE IS ROUND FIRST BY LONG WAY THAT IS A GREAT SWIM TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY HE IS 
ONE TENTH OF SECOND OUTSIDE THE WORLD RECORD HE IS GOING TO MAKE THE FINAL WITH THAT 
THAT IS WHY WE SAW HIM THAT TONIGHT HE HAS QUITE A WHILE TO 
REST GOOD REACTION OF THE BLOCK 
FOSTER WENT IN FIRST HE HAS 
FANTASTIC SPEED STILL HAS FOSTER 
WE WERE SURPRISED TO SEE YOU OUT 
THERE WE WERE TOLD YOU WERE GIVING 
THAT ONE A MISS 
IT WAS A BIT OF A 
LOTTERY MY DID NOT WANT TO PUT AN 
AWFUL LOT OF EFFORT IN IF I HAD 
NOT AT LEAST I HAVE A FREESTYLE AT 
THE END 
I USED SAY YOU LET ADAM 
PINE WHEN 
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M LIKE 
YOU HAD BETTER GO AND LIE DOWN THIS IS THE SECOND SEMI FINAL QUITE A FEW SWIMMERS ARE SWIMMING 
IN THE STATES AND BENEFITING FROM 
THEIR SPRINT PROGRAMME THERE ARE TWO NEW ZEALANDERS IN THE SEMI FINAL IT IS A FIFTY M. RACE AND FIFTEEN OF THE 
START AND FIFTY M. OF THE TERM YOU CAN 
DO UNDER WATER 
THAT IS THIRTY METRES 
ANDREW SIXTY PER CENT THEY WERE NOT PARTICULARLY STILL I 
AM NOT SURE IF THE STARTER WILL 
HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT THEY 
HAVE TO BE ABSOLUTELY STILL BE FOR 
THE STARTER WILL ALLOW THE GUN TO 
GO TWO SWIMMERS BACK UNDER TWENTY THREE THAT 
PUTS FOSTER THIRD FASTEST INTO THE 
FINAL 
IT IS FANTASTIC MOST OF US FINAL WERE THINKING IT HE WOULD PULL OUT 
WE ARE QUITE OLD AND WE THINK HE 
MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO DO WITH IT HE 
GETS IN AND GETS THE THIRD POSITION 
IS IT A MISTAKE GIVEN HE HAS THE 
FIFTY M. FREESTYLE COMING UP 
ONLY HE 
WILL KNOW AND WE CAN ONLY TELL 
AFTER THE FREESTYLE GETTING ON THE 
BLOCK HE HAS TO GO IN WITH THE 
ATTITUDE THAT SAYS I HAVE JUST 
SWUM AT FANTASTIC FIFTY M. FLY HE STILL 
HAS A LOT OF VITALITY OF COURSE HE 
CAN DO TWO MORLAND'S 
A VERY GOOD 
SWIM FROM THE RUSSIAN 
I THINK FOSTER PLAYS UP TO ITS A 
BIT HE LIKES PEOPLE TO THINK HE IS 
TIRED WHEN HE CAME OUT HE WENT 
AND TOOK A SCOOP OF WATER AND 
TASTED THE POOL WHY WOULD YOU DO 
THAT 
BECAUSE IT TASTES GOOD YOU THAT GET USED TO THE WATER YOU ARE 
ABOUT TO DIVE IN ITS IT IS GOOD TO 
GET THE FEELING THE FEEL OF YOUR 
BODY THROUGH WATER IS A GOOD THING 
SO WHY NOT GET IN TOUCH WITH ITS 
AND ALSO PRESUMABLY THERE IS PRIZE 
MONEY ON OFFER IF HE MAKES THE 
FINAL HE WILL GET MORE MONEY THERE THERE IS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR FIRST PLACE AND 
TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THIRD ALSO FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR 
A WORLD RECORD IT IS CERTAINLY 
WORTH DOING THAT SO A FEW SUMMERS 
WILL COME BACK WITH QUITE A LOT OF 
MONEY BUT I'M NOT SURE THE CASH 
FOR MARC FOSTER IS IT HE IS TRYING 
TO SEE HOW FAST HE CAN GO HE HAS 
TO HAVE A GO AT RACE PRACTICE THE THE MAIN THING IS IT IS ABOUT HONOUR 
AND PARTICULARLY IN FRONT OF A 
BRITISH CROWD WE ARE ABOUT TO HAVE 
OUR FIRST MEDAL CEREMONY THIS IS 
THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE HAD THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS IN THE U. K. THAT THAT MEDAL IS IMPORTANT YOU COULD HEAR 
IT IN HER VOICE WHEN SHE DID THAT 
INTERVIEW IT IS A FIRST SENIOR 
INDIVIDUAL MEDAL SHE HAS WON SOME 
GREAT REALISE AND DONE SOME GOOD 
ANCHORS 
THIS IS VERY VERY SPECIAL FOR HER 
IT IS HER EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY SO WE 
COULDN'T BE BETTER IT 
IS AN AMAZING ACHIEVEMENT I CANNOT SAY HOW BIG OF A RACE THAT IS FOR GREAT BRITAIN'S FAN HALSALL 
FROM THE CITY OF LIVERPOOL THE 
BRONZE MEDAL GOES TO FINLAND WHAT A MOMENT FOR THIS YOUNG LADY 
SHE IS EIGHTEEN TOMORROW CITY OF 
LIVERPOOL'S FAN HALSALL IS THE 
SILVER MEDALLIST AT THE WORLD SHORT 
COURSE CHAMPIONSHIPS IN THE WOMEN'S 
ONE HUNDRED M. FREESTYLE DESTROYED THE 
BRITISH RECORD THE SEVENTH FASTEST 
SWIM IN HISTORY KAREN PICKERING GOT A BRONZE SUE 
ROLPH ALSO GOT A BRONZE THAT IS 
THE BEST PERFORMANCE WE HAVE EVER 
HAD WELL DONE TO FAN HALSALL SHE HAD TO Y. AND BEAT THIS YOUNG LADY TODAY SHE WAS THE BEST MARLEEN VELDHUIS WORLD RECORD 
HOLDER ON THE FIFTY M. FREESTYLE THERE 
IS JUST NO CATCHING HER IT IS GOLD 
TO 
VELDHUIS OF HOLLAND AND 
THE SILVER TO FRAN HALSALL THE 
BRONZE TO FINLAND FOUR 
YEARS AGO SHE GOT BRONZE TWO YEARS AGO IT WAS SILVER NOW 
MARLEEN VELDHUIS OF HOLLAND IS THE 
FIRST DUTCH WOMAN TO WIN THIS RACE 
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME VERY FAST 
DUTCH FREESTYLERS A ON 
THE LEFT HAND SIDE HOW BIG OF THE RACE WAS THAT FOR FRAN HALSALL 
A FANTASTIC RACE ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST SO FAR IN HER CAREER 
SILVER AT THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS 
SET SO UP FOR A GREAT CAREER I 
THINK IT IS THE FIRST OF MANY 
SETS HER UP SHE HAS BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT GOING TO TWO THOUSAND TWELVE GETTING A GOLD 
MEDAL AND QUITTING BUT I THINK SHE 
WILL GO TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY 
FRAN HALSALL HAS 
BEEN TALKING ABOUT HER EIGHTEENTH 
BIRTHDAY WHICH IS TOMORROW A 
MOTHER WILL BE TAKING HER TO PARIS 
AS A TREAT THERE'S THAT SIMMONDS 
WILL BE EIGHTEEN IN JANUARY AND SHE'S IN 
HIS NEXT IN THE FINAL OF THE TWO HUNDRED M. 
BACKSTROKE SHE LOOKS VERY 
IMPRESSIVE 
YES SHE HAS GOT A IMPRESSIVE GREAT FUTURE PART OF THE GROUP 
COMING THROUGH TOGETHER SHE GOT A 
BRITISH RECORD THIS MORNING A 
RECORD WHICH HAS STOOD FOR SEVEN 
YEARS SHE WILL BE UP AGAINST 
KIRSTY COVENTRY SHE SET A WORLD 
RECORD EARLIER IN THE WEEK IN THE 
FOUR HUNDRED M. MEDLEY AND SHE TOOK THE TWO HUNDRED M. 
BACKSTROKE RECORD IN THE LONG 
COURSE THIS YEAR A VERY TOUGH 
OPPONENT BUT I WOULD NOT BE 
SURPRISED IF ELIZABETH GETS VERY 
CLOSE TO THAT WORLD RECORD AS WELL 
YOU THINK THAT KIRSTY COVENTRY IS 
FAVOURITE TO WIN BUT ELIZABETH 
SIMMONDS MIGHT GET SILVER 
I HOPE 
SO IT IS A TALL ORDER TO EXPECTED 
TO WIN THE GOLD A BIT LIKE 
FRANCESCA F. IN THAT FREESTYLE BUT 
ON FOR A MEDAL 
THE ELIZABETH 
SIMMONDS WAS ASKED IF SHE HAS ANY 
PETS SHE SAYS THAT SHE HAS MICE 
BUT THEY ARE NOT OURS AND A CAT 
THAT IS NOT OURS L. WOULD SUGGEST THAT IF SHE DOES NOT WANT TO HAVE 
THE MIC ANY MORE SHE SHOULD GET THE CAT 
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ONE 
WOULD HAVE EATEN THE OTHER SHE SHE WILL BE COMING OUT VERY SHORTLY WE 
HOPE THAT SHE HAS A ZIP OF 
TRACKSUIT BECAUSE ADRIAN MOORHOUSE 
HAS A THING IN HIS HEAD ABOUT THAT 
EXCUSE ME THAT WAS ANDREW JAMIESON 
I THINK IT IS A GREAT IDEA 
ELIZABETH SIMMONDS IN FIVE KIRSTY 
COVENTRY IN FOUR MARGARET HOELZER 
IS THE PREVIOUS WORLD CHAMPION 
WHAT A FIELD THIS IS MARY DESCENZA 
HAS ALREADY GOT GOLD ON THE TWO HUNDRED M. 
BUTTERFLY THERE SHE IS FULLY U. S. A. 
CAREFUL THESE OUTSIDE LANES ARE 
PRETTY DANGEROUS WE HAVE SEEN GOLD 
AND SILVERS FROM LANE EIGHT ALREADY 
KATERYNA ZUBKOVA ALREADY HAS SOME 
MEDALS IT WILL BE A VERY TALL 
ORDER TO BEAT MARGARET HOELZER AND 
KIRSTY COVENTRY BUT I DO THINK SHE 
CAN GET AMONG THEM KIRSTY COVENTRY 
IS OLYMPIC CHAMPION THERE IS BUT 
SIMMONDS IS EUROPEAN JUNIOR 
CHAMPION IN LANE FIVE HOW WAS SHE 
SPENT IT HOW WILL SHE SWIM IT 
MARGARET HOELZER IS A FANTASTIC 
AMERICAN SUMMER ONE OF THE BETTER 
ONES TO COME OVER FROM THE STATES 
ELIZABETH'S COACH WAS TALKING ABOUT 
FOUR BEERS IN A CAR AND SHE WILL BE 
TRIED TO GET INTO FIFTH GEAR KIRSTY COVENTRY IS HAVING THE MEET 
OF HER LIFE 
THE OLYMPIC CHAMPION 
IN THE TWO HUNDRED BACKSTROKE IN THIS EVENT 
SHE WON THE ONE HUNDRED M. BACKSTROKE SO WE 
KNOW THAT SHE HAS GREAT STAMINA AND 
SPEED SHE VERY NEARLY BROKE THE 
WORLD RECORD IN THE HEATS VERY 
NEARLY SHE WAS FOUR TENTHS OF A 
SECOND OUTSIDE IT WORLD CHAMPION 
IN THREE OLYMPIC CHAMPION IN FOUR 
EUROPEAN JUNIOR CHAMPION FROM GREAT 
BRITAIN IN FIVE SECOND FASTEST 
QUALIFIER AND THREE OR FOUR MONTHS 
BEFORE THE OLYMPIC GAMES THIS IS 
THE PERFECT TEST FOR THE YOUNGSTERS 
FROM GREAT BRITAIN NOT EASY AT ALL 
BUT SHOWING THEM WHAT IT WILL FEEL 
LIKE TOWARDS THE OLYMPIC GAMES WE WE SAW HANNAH MILEY CHALLENGE KIRSTY 
COVENTRY AND EBB IN THE SAME IS 
TRUE FOR ELIZABETH SIMMONDS AS WELL 
I THINK THE SAME IS TRUE FOR 
THESE YOUNG WOMEN TO BE RACING AND 
NOT BEING AFRAID THAT IS GREAT 
BECAUSE THEY ARE SCARING THE OTHERS 
KIRSTY COVENTRY WAS SCARED BECAUSE 
HANNAH MILEY WAS HUNTING HER DOWN 
SHE KNOWS THAT WHEN HER CAREER ENDS 
SIMMONDS AND HANNAH MILEY WILL BE 
TAKING OVER AND THAT IS GREAT THE FINAL OF 
THE WOMEN'S TWO HUNDRED M. BACKSTROKE GREAT BRITAIN IS FOUR LANES FROM THE BOTTOM A VERY GOOD START FROM 
SERMONS SHE HAD A SHOCKER IN THE 
HEATS BUT THAT WAS VERY GOOD 
ELIZABETH SIMMONDS KIRSTY COMMENTARY IS IN THE FORM OF HER LIFE IN FOUR KIRSTY COVENTRY I THINK KIRSTY COVENTRY IS GOING FOR THE WORLD RECORD ELIZABETH SIMMONDS GOT A GOOD START 
SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO WIND UP 
AND THEN COME BACK STRONGLY 
HOPEFULLY SHE HAS SOMETHING TO GET 
INTO SILVER MEDAL POSITION BUT 
KIRSTY COVENTRY IS GOING FOR 
WORLD RECORD 
SHE HAS GONE 
EXTREMELY FAST DOWN THE FIRST ONE HUNDRED 
IF SHE CAN KEEP THIS GOING SEE WILL 
OBLITERATE THE WORLD RECORD MY GOODNESS FIFTEEN AND A WORLD RECORD 
PACE ZERO SPECIMENS IS NOT FAR AWAY 
BENEATH WORLD RECORD PACE 
ELIZABETH SIMMONDS IS NOT FAR AWAY 
SHE WAS TALKING THIS MORNING ABOUT 
BEING TIRED BUT THIS IS NOT THE 
RACE OF SOMEBODY THAT IS TIRED SHE IS WAY AHEAD OF THE WORLD 
RECORD BUT WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS TWO SECONDS AND WORLD RECORD 
ELIZABETH SIMMONDS IS NOT RECORD FAR OFF AS WELL IT TWO SECONDS BENEATH WORLD RECORD KIRSTY COVENTRY LOOKED SO STRONG 
SURELY SHE WILL NOT LET THIS GO 
ELIZABETH SIMMONDS HAD A SUPER TURN 
SHE IS NOT LETTING HER GO SHE SET 
THE COMMONWEALTH RECORD ON THE HEAT 
THE WORLD RECORD HAS BEEN 
COMPLETELY SMASHED TWO MINUTES NINETY ONE 
A FANTASTIC SWIM FROM KIRSTY 
COVENTRY OF ZIMBABWE A MASSIVE 
SWIM AND THE SILVER MEDAL GOES TO 
ELIZABETH SIMMONDS HER TIME WAS 
TWO MINUTES POINT SIXTY WHAT A RACE THIS IS AN AWESOME RACE ONE OF THE 
BEST THAT I HAVE SEEN THIS WEEK SO 
FAR 
THEY ARE BOTH DELIGHTED THREE FAR TIMES IN THIS WEEK BRITAIN HAD 
BROKEN WORLD RECORDS WITH A SILVER 
MEDAL BUT TWO MINUTES FOR 
BACKSTROKE FOR WOMEN FANTASTIC I I THINK FIFTY EIGHT WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR 
THE FINAL OF THE ONE HUNDRED LOOK AT A STROKE TECHNIQUE ROLL 
YOUR SHOULDER UP TO GET YOUR ARM 
OUT YOU GET SOME GOOD DEEP WATER 
ELIZABETH SIMMONDS CAME BACK FASTER 
KIRSTY COVENTRY KIRSTY COVENTRY WILL BE ONE TO BEAT 
IN BEIJING SHE IS HAVING A 
FANTASTIC SWIM ONE OF THE GREATEST 
WINS OF THE MEET SO FAR AND 
ELIZABETH SIMMONDS WAS BRILLIANT 
MANY CONGRATULATIONS A WORLD 
SILVER MEDAL INSIDE THE OLD WORLD 
RECORD 
I CANNOT BELIEVE IT I AM RECORD ABSOLUTELY GOBSMACKED L. JUST 
WANTED TO KEEP ON AS CLOSE AS I 
COULD DO KIRSTY COVENTRY BUT 
MAINTAIN MY OWN RACE AS WELL AND 
NOT GET TOO CARRIED AWAY WITH WHAT 
SHE WAS DOING L. WAS DELIGHTED 
AFTER WATCHING THIS MORNING I 
THOUGHT THAT IF YOU STAYED WITH 
KIRSTY COVENTRY YOU WOULD DO WELL 
YOU LOOKED GOOD THIS MORNING 
ITS 
IT DID LOOK GOOD THIS MORNING BUT I 
WAS NOT HOLDING ANYTHING BACK 
BECAUSE OF THE ADRENALIN I'M 
DELIGHTED TO BE IN A FINAL LIKE 
THAT 
HOW MUCH DOES IT HELP TO HAVE THAT THE PARTISAN CROWD WITH YOU 
FANTASTIC HALF OF THESE PEOPLE DO 
NOT EVEN KNOW ME BUT THEY ARE RULED 
CHEERING HAVING MY PARENTS HERE IS 
FANTASTIC OBVIOUSLY THE GREAT 
BRITAIN TEAM IT IS THE SAME AS IT 
WAS LAST YEAR AT THE WORLD'S IN 
AUSTRALIA THEY WERE ALL GUNNING 
FOR THE AUSSIES THEN IT IS 
HAPPENING FOR US NOW IT WILL BE 
FANTASTIC TO SEE LONDON TWO THOUSAND TWELVE ENJOY ENJOY YOUR MEDAL 
WORLD CHAMPION AND A MASSIVE WORLD 
RECORD FOR KIRSTY COVENTRY FROM 
ZIMBABWE THAT SWIM FROM ELIZABETH 
SIMMONDS HIS EUROPEAN RECORD 
BRILLIANT IS ANOTHER WORLD RECORD SENSATIONAL 
WE THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO GO 
UNDER TWO MINUTES 
I WAS TALKING 
WITH MY COACH BEFORE AND SHE SAID 
AND SHOULD BE EVEN BIG ABOUT FIFTY NINE 
SHOULD WE EVEN THINK ABOUT FIFTY NINE L. 
KNEW THAT WAS A BIG DIFFERENCE L. 
LEVELLED ON THE ONE HUNDRED SO I WOULD 
HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT HARDER IN THE 
FIRST ONE HUNDRED SO DID NOT QUITE KNOW 
THAT I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT 
VERY HAPPY WITH THAT TIME A A BEAUTIFULLY CONTROLLED RACE YOU 
ARE GETTING BETTER AND BETTER A 
LOT THE WEST MIGHT THINK YOU ARE 
TIRED BECAUSE OF YOUR SCHEDULE BUT 
THAT IS NOT THE CASE A LOT OF US 
MY LEGS ARE TIRED THE ATMOSPHERE 
GETS TOO FIRED UP AND HAVING MY 
FAMILY HERE MY SISTER AND HER 
HUSBAND AN UNCLE FROM ZIMBABWE 
THEY ARE ALL VISITING IT IS THE 
FIRST TIME THEY HAVE SEEN ME SWIM 
INTERNATIONALLY AND IT IS A LOT OF 
FUN 
EVERYBODY HERE IS LOVING YOU FUN AND APPRECIATING THE GREAT SWIMMING 
WELL DONE 
WHAT A LOVELY LADY AS WELL THE 
START LIST FOR THE MEN'S TWO HUNDRED M. 
BREASTSTROKE KRIS GILCHRIST WAS 
SECOND FASTEST INTO THE FINAL HE 
COMES FROM A REAL HOT HOUSE OF 
TALENT AND THEIR COACH 
FRED 
WHAT A JOB 
HE IS DOING WITH HIS SWIMMERS KRIS KRIS GILCHRIST THERE HE QUALIFIED IN A 
GREAT TIME L. WAS TALKING TO HIM 
BEFORE IN THE WARM UP AND HE WAS 
SAYING THAT HE HAS A LOT OF 
SWIMMERS HE THINKS HE IS A BETTER 
COACH OVER TWO HUNDRED AND HE IS GOOD WITH 
ENERGY LEVELS THAT IS FASCINATING 
HE RUNS THE PROGRAMME AT THE TWO HUNDRED 
LEVEL AND SEEMS TO BE DOING WELL 
WITH THAT BUT WHAT A GREAT 
BREASTSTROKE COACH L. THINK KRIS 
GILCHRIST HAS AN EQUAL CHANCE OF 
GETTING A MEDAL AND POSSIBLY THE 
GOLD IGOR BORYSIK HAS GOT FORM WE 
WILL BE REPRESENTING GREAT BRITAIN 
IN THE ONE HUNDRED L. THINK THE RACE WILL 
BE WITH IGOR BORYSIK AND KRIS 
GILCHRIST THE BIG GUYS SEEM TO BE IN FOUR AND 
FIVE IGOR BORYSIK OF THE UKRAINE 
AND KRIS GILCHRIST OF GREAT BRITAIN 
IN FIVE MOVEMENT THERE FROM THREE CUES 
SILKY HANG ON A HORROR FROM JAPAN 
Q. C. O. K. YAH THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT GOING OUT IN SIXTY ONE WITH SOMETHING LEFT THERE ARE ONLY TWO SWIMMERS IN THIS FINAL WHO SWAM THE ONE HUNDRED GILCHRIST ISN'T RUSHING THIS
