OH IT'S ALL BECOMING CLEAR NOW 
THE DOCTOR IS THE MAN YOU'D LIKE TO BE DOING IMPOSSIBLE THINGS 
WITH CRICKET BALLS I DISCOVERED A TALENT THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE 
BUT THE DOCTOR HAS AN EYE FOR THE LADIES THE DEVIL 
A GIRL AT EVERY FIREPLACE 
AHA NOW 
YOU'RE NOT IRISH NOT AT ALL NO 
MY FATHER SYDNEY WAS A WATCHMAKER FROM NOTTINGHAM 
AND MY MOTHER VERITY WAS 
SHE ABSOLUTELY WAS THE MOTHER OF DOCTOR WHO 
THE BRILLIANT THING IS IF YOU LOOK AT VERITY LAMBERT'S WORK 
THE VOICE IS DIFFERENT EVERY TIME 
THERE'S NOT A GREAT BIG VERITY LAMBERT STAMP ON THINGS 
YOU LOOK AT THE DAVID RENWICK STUFF YOU LOOK AT ROCK FOLLIES YOU LOOK YOU LOOK AT DOCTOR WHO 
THEY'RE VERY VERY DIFFERENT PROGRAMMES SHE'S A GENIUS 
VERITY LAMBERT WAS THE QUEEN OF TELEVISION DRAMA 
FROM HER EARLY DAYS AS ONE OF THE B. B. C.'S YOUNGEST EVER PRODUCERS 
UNTIL HER DEATH IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY OF THE MOST POPULAR 
AND ACCLAIMED PROGRAMMES SEEN ON BRITISH TELEVISION 
SHE WAS THE PRODUCER ON THE FIRST SERIES OF DOCTOR WHO 
AND APPARENTLY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DALEKS 
SHE WAS WHAT A PRODUCER SHOULD BE 
SHE WAS A TOUCH OF THE VISIONARY 
YOU CANNOT TOUCH ME NOW I AM ONE OF THE STATELY HOMOS OF ENGLAND 
SHE'S GOT SUCH AN IMPRESSIVE BODY OF WORK IS NOT REALLY AN ACCIDENT 
SHE'S INTELLIGENT AND TALENTED 
BUT IT'S DEDICATION TO MAKING IT ALL REALLY GOOD 
MEANING BECAUSE I'M AN INTOLERANT GAS BAG WHO CAN'T KEEP 
HER TRAP SHUT FOR MORE THAN FIVE SECONDS AT A TIME 
IF SHE WAS HERE TODAY SHE WOULD BE QUITE HAPPY FOR ME TO SAY 
SHE COULD BE AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE 
I CAN EXPLAIN EVERYTHING 
SHE SCARED THE PANTS OFF A LOT OF PEOPLE 
I THINK YOU'D BLEEDING BETTER 
IT WOULD BE EASIER TO LOSE AN ARTICULATED LORRY THAN LOSE YOUR EGO 
WHAT I WANT IS WHATEVER WILL MAKE YOU HAPPIEST 
THIS WOMAN HAS CHANGED TELEVISION HISTORY 
I THINK WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT VERITY'S CAREER IS THE LONGEVITY OF IT 
I MEAN FIFTY YEARS IS A VERY LONG TIME TO BE WORKING IN TELEVISION 
AND STILL TO BE WORKING AT THE TIME THAT SHE DIED AND IT SPANS 
VIRTUALLY THE WHOLE HISTORY OF BRITISH TELEVISION DRAMA 
FROM THE EARLY LIVE DAYS THROUGH TO THE HI TECH DAYS OF THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS 
SO SHE SAW AN AWFUL LOT OF CHANGES IN THAT TIME 
VERITY LAMBERT BEGAN HER CAREER AS A SECRETARY IN COMMERCIAL TELEVISION 
QUICKLY MOVING UP THE RANKS TO PRODUCTION ASSISTANT 
ON THE PIONEERING I. T. V. DRAMA SERIES ARMCHAIR THEATRE 
RUN BY THE LEGENDARY CANADIAN PRODUCER SYDNEY NEWMAN 
WHEN NEWMAN LEFT I. T. V. TO JOIN THE B. B. C. IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE 
AND WAS LOOKING FOR A PRODUCER FOR HIS NEW CHILDREN'S SCIENCE FICTION SERIES HE THOUGHT OF VERITY 
I DIDN'T FEEL I HAD ANYONE ON THE STAFF WHO SEEMED RIGHT FOR THE KIND 
OF IDIOCY AND FUN AND YET SERIOUS UNDERLYING INTENT 
I PHONED UP MY OLD PRODUCTION ASSISTANT AT A. B. C. VERITY LAMBERT 
AND I OFFERED HER A PROMOTION WOULD SHE COME OVER AND BE A PRODUCER WHICH SHE GRABBED THE CHANCE 
I THINK HE WANTED TO TRY AND MAKE IT DIFFERENT AND HAVE SOMEBODY 
WHO PERHAPS HADN'T DONE ANYTHING BEFORE 
OR AT LEAST HAD DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO PRODUCE THINGS 
IT WAS RATHER A SORT OF FORGOTTEN BABY TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BECAUSE 
THE CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENT DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT AND WERE RATHER CROSS THAT IT WAS BEING 
MADE BY THE DRAMA DEPARTMENT AND THE PEOPLE IN THE DRAMA DEPARTMENT ON THE WHOLE FELT 
THAT IT WAS A CHILDREN'S SHOW AND THEREFORE CONSEQUENTLY 
WAS BENEATH THEIR NOTICE APART FROM OF COURSE SYDNEY NEWMAN 
I WALKED INTO THIS ROOM WHICH WAS VERY SMALL 
A TABLE AND TWO CHAIRS AND THERE WAS THIS YOUNG WOMAN 
AND SHE SAID HELLO 
MY NAME IS VERITY AND I SAID HELLO MY NAME IS WARIS 
AND SHE SAID WELL I THINK WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER 
AND I SAID YES BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT 
AND SHE SAID IT'S ABOUT THIS MAN WHO LIVES IN A POLICE PHONE BOX AND HE TRAVELS IN TIME 
JUST LET ME GET THIS RIGHT 
A THING THAT LOOKS LIKE A POLICE BOX STUCK IN A JUNK YARD 
CAN MOVE ANYWHERE IN TIME AND SPACE 
YES OH SUSAN DON'T BE RIDICULOUS 
I SAID WELL HOW DO WE DO THIS I MEAN IT'S RIDICULOUS 
I SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE 
SHE SAID I DON'T KNOW EITHER BUT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SOMETHING OF IT AREN'T WE 
WORKING ON A SMALL BUDGET AND UNDER DIFFICULT STUDIO CONDITIONS 
VERITY AND HER YOUNG DIRECTOR SHOT THEIR FIRST PILOT FOR DOCTOR WHO 
WHAT'S IT DOING HERE 
THEY'RE ALWAYS IN THE STREET 
FEEL IT CAN YOU FEEL IT 
BUT WHEN NEWMAN WATCHED IT HE WAS FAR FROM IMPRESSED 
SYDNEY TOOK VERITY AND ME OUT TO DINNER AND HE SAID 
I THINK YOU GUYS BY RIGHTS SHOULD BE FIRED BY ME 
BUT HE SAID I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A SECOND CHANCE BECAUSE I THINK YOU'VE BOTH GOT TALENT 
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WE RE DID IT AND THAT WAS THE FIRST EPISODE 
FULL MARKS TO SYDNEY 
NEWMAN'S GAMBLE ON VERITY PAID OFF AND THE FIRST EPISODE OF DOCTOR WHO CAUGHT THE PUBLIC'S IMAGINATION 
AND WHEN SHE INTRODUCED THE DOCTOR'S MOST FAMOUS ENEMIES INTO THE SERIES 
IT WAS THE FIRST OF MANY CREATIVE RISKS THAT SHE WOULD TAKE THROUGHOUT HER CAREER 
SHE CAME OUT WITH THIS DALEK BUSINESS AND I WAS LIVID 
ONE OF THE RULES THAT I LAID DOWN IS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO BUG EYED MONSTERS 
AND THEN SUDDENLY I'M AT HOME ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND WATCHING DOCTOR WHO AND THERE ARE THE DALEKS 
WALK AHEAD OF US AND FOLLOW MY DIRECTIONS 
AND I PHONED VERITY UP IMMEDIATELY AND I SAID WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON I SAID COME ON 
SHE SAID WHAT I SAID NO BUG EYED MONSTERS 
COME IN MY OFFICE ON MONDAY MORNING AND I HUNG UP ON HER 
SHE CAME INTO THE OFFICE I SHOWED HER THE MEMO 
I SAID YOU AGREED AND SHE PROTESTED AND PROTESTED AND SHE SAID SYDNEY 
THOSE WERE NOT BUG EYED MONSTERS WE OBEY 
REALLY THEY WERE ONCE LIVING CREATURES 
WITH BRAINS AND THEIR BRAINS 
HAD BECOME SO LARGE THEIR BODIES HAD ATROPHIED AND THEY NEEDED THE METAL CASING TO SUPPORT THE BRAIN 
GO TO POSITION ON MY COMMAND ADVANCE AND ATTACK 
ERADICATE 
OBLITERATE 
ANNIHILATE SHE DIDN'T BACK DOWN 
SHE FOUGHT ME 
AND OF COURSE IT TURNED OUT THAT IT MADE THIS WHOLE SERIES A SUCCESS 
THE DALEKS TURNED DOCTOR WHO INTO A NATIONAL SENSATION 
VERITY WAS NOW ONE OF THE RISING STARS OF TELEVISION DRAMA 
BUT HER SUCCESS AND HER GENDER WERE NOT WELCOMED BY EVERYONE AT THE B. B. C. 
I HAD BEEN QUITE LUCKY IN TERMS OF MY CAREER 
IN THAT I WAS PRODUCING DOCTOR WHO 
WHEN I WAS TWENTY SEVEN AND EVEN FOR A MAN 
IN THOSE DAYS THAT WAS QUITE YOUNG 
I THINK SHE MUST HAVE BEEN THE MOST ASTONISHING FIGURE IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE 
IF YOU THINK OF WHAT THE B. B. C. WAS LIKE IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE 
DEMOB SUITS CIGARETTES AND MEN 
ALL MEN 
YOU WENT INTO THE B. B. C. IN THE EARLY SIXTIES AND IT WAS FULL 
OF UNIVERSITY GRADUATES AND GRADUATES FROM A CERTAIN BACKGROUND 
SHE WAS NOT OF THAT BACKGROUND 
I MEAN SHE WAS A JEWISH GIRL WHO DIDN'T LIKE GOING TO PUBLIC SCHOOL 
WHO WAS A SINGLE 
ONLY CHILD WHO WANTED TO MAKE IT IN LIFE AND SHE WAS GOING TO MAKE IT BY HER OWN STRENGTH 
GRIT AND DETERMINATION WELL NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE DOING THAT IN TELEVISION THEN BUT SHE DID IT 
I DID HAVE A BAD TWO OR THREE MONTHS WHEN I FIRST JOINED THE B. B. C. 
WHEN I SEEMED TO BE MUCH YOUNGER THAN ANYONE ELSE AND A WOMAN 
BUT AFTER THAT ONCE IN FACT YOU START WORKING AND DOING YOUR JOB 
AND PROVIDING IT SEEMS TO BE GOING ALL RIGHT PEOPLE ACCEPT YOU EVEN MEN 
THERE WOULD BE A LITTLE RIPPLE NOW IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IF SOMEONE WHO WAS TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN 
WAS COMING IN AND TAKING A LEAD PRIMETIME DRAMA AND SHE STRODE 
INTO THAT MALE POST WAR BASTION OF RESPECTABILITY AND CUT A SWATHE 
THROUGH IT AND PRODUCED A SHOW THAT IS STILL RUNNING TODAY 
IT'S JUST EXTRAORDINARY 
DON'T FORGET THIS WAS THE EARLY SIXTIES WHEN YOUTH WAS LITERALLY 
BURSTING OUT IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE MUSIC WORLD 
WE WERE PARALLEL IN OUR LIVES TO THE BEATLES AND THAT SORT OF THING 
SO SYDNEY SAW THAT THERE WAS SOME POTENTIAL HERE 
VERITY'S NEXT MAJOR SERIES ADAM ADAMANT LIVES 
WAS ANOTHER SLICE OF FANTASY TELEVISION 
ABOUT A VICTORIAN JAMES BOND WORKING FROM SUSPENDED ANIMATION TO FIND HIMSELF IN SWINGING LONDON 
BUT THIS WASN'T JUST A CYNICAL FOLLOW UP TO DOCTOR WHO 
FOR THE YOUNG FEMALE PRODUCER HER NEW SHOW WAS AS MUCH ABOUT 
THE CONTEMPORARY LIBERATED WOMAN AS IT WAS ABOUT ITS OLD FASHIONED HERO 
MR. ADAM PLEASE 
PLEASE COME WITH ME 
I SHALL TAKE MY STAND HERE 
LET GO OF ME BOY 
I'M NOT A BOY I'M A GIRL 
SHE WAS A FIRM BELIEVER IN POPULAR TELEVISION 
SHE WANTED TO MAKE PROGRAMMES THAT WERE GOING TO BE WATCHED BY LOTS OF PEOPLE 
AND SHE FELT THAT 
POPULAR TELEVISION COULD DEAL WITH SERIOUS ISSUES 
AND THAT WAS A HALLMARK I THINK OF ALL OF HER WORK 
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT I SPENT THE WHOLE NIGHT HERE WITH YOU 
I COULDN'T VERY WELL THROW YOU OUT COULD I 
HOW CAN I BEGIN TO APOLOGISE 
FOR WHAT WELL FOR HAVING COMPROMISED YOU IN THIS WAY 
OH THAT YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO SPEND A NIGHT ON THAT SOFA YES BUT NOT SURELY MEN 
OF COURSE MEN WHYEVER NOT 
IT WASN'T JUST ON SCREEN THAT VERITY FELT WOMEN SHOULD HAVE A PROMINENT ROLE DON'T SAY THE LINE 
FROM STUDIO FLOOR MANAGERS TO DIRECTORS SHE ENSURED FEMALE STAFF 
WERE INVOLVED IN ALL ASPECTS OF HER SERIES 
I'M CERTAIN THAT WAS WHY I WAS DOING IT BECAUSE I WAS A BORN DIRECTOR WHICH IS WHAT SHE WANTED 
IT CERTAINLY WAS UNUSUAL TO HAVE A WOMAN PRODUCER YES 
YOU HAD LOTS OF WOMEN AS STORY EDITORS 
BUT VERY FEW PRODUCERS THAT I CAN REMEMBER 
SHE WAS IN THE CHRYSALIS OF HER CAREER WHEN I MET HER 
SHE WAS YOUNGER THAN I WAS SHE'D DONE DOCTOR WHO BUT NOT MUCH ELSE 
SHE WAS VERY YOUNG AND I REMEMBER VERY CLEARLY MY FIRST IMPRESSION 
OF HER WHICH WAS THAT SHE WAS DECISIVE AND SHE WAS RUTHLESS 
I DON'T THINK YOU REALLY LISTENED TO WHAT I SAID TO YOU DID YOU 
I TOLD YOU TO MIND YOUR MANNERS OTHERWISE I MIGHT JUST FORGET THAT I'M A LADY 
IT WAS A MASCULINE PROVINCE THE CORRIDORS OF THE B. B. C. 
AND THIS YOUNG GIRL CALMLY 
AND QUIETLY LIKE AN ICICLE MOVING THROUGH WAS QUITE SOMETHING 
ONE KNEW SHE WAS ON HER WAY 
ALTHOUGH ADAM ADAMANT LIVES FAILED TO REPEAT THE SUCCESS OF DOCTOR WHO 
VERITY'S REPUTATION AS A PRODUCER OF POPULAR QUALITY DRAMA 
CONTINUED TO GROW 
A SERIES OF SOMERSET MAUGHAM PLAYS WON THE FIRST OF MANY BAFTA AWARDS 
AND IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SHE LEFT THE B. B. C. FOR LONDON WEEKEND TELEVISION 
TO PRODUCE BUDGIE STARRING ADAM FAITH 
AREN'T YOU COMING IN BUDGIE 
NO I DON'T THINK SO GUV 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MISSING 
DON'T YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE BABY NO I'M TRYING TO GIVE THEM UP 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MISSING 
WHILE ITS TITLE CHARACTER HAD NONE OF ADAMANT'S CHIVALRY 
BOTH VERITY AND THE AUDIENCE GREW TO LOVE HIS JACK THE LAD CHARM 
I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS WHAT MONEY 
NUMBER TWELVE IN THE NATIONAL RATINGS 
SO WE'VE GONE UP YOU'VE GONE UP 
THANK GOD FOR THAT 
BUT WITH THE RISE OF WOMEN'S LIB BUDGIE'S SEXISM BEGAN TO SEEM AS OUTDATED AS ADAM ADAMANT 
AND WHEN VERITY RETURNED TO THE B. B. C. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE IT WAS TO MAKE A SERIES THAT 
PUT FEMINISM AT ITS VERY CENTRE THE STORY OF THE ORIGINAL WOMEN'S MOVEMENT THE SUFFRAGETTES 
IT WAS SOMETHING WHICH WAS VERY CLOSE TO HER HEART I MEAN SHE REALLY BELIEVED IN THE WHOLE IDEA 
AND THEN SHE WANTED AS MANY WOMEN ON THE STAFF OF DOING IT AS POSSIBLE 
THIS WORLD IS RULED BY MEN OF MEN FOR MEN 
AND WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT YES WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT 
SHE AND MIDGE MACKENZIE WHO WAS THE STORY EDITOR AND GEORGIA BROWN 
THEY ALL USED TO WEAR VERY LARGE HATS I REMEMBER 
WHICH THEY INSISTED ON WEARING WHEN THEY WERE HAVING LUNCH 
YOU SEE THE THREE OF THEM LIKE THREE LARGE MUSHROOMS SITTING AT THE TABLE 
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN ALL FEMALE PRODUCTION TEAM 
VERITY IN HER WISDOM DECIDED THAT SHE NEEDED 
SOME KIND OF MALE PARTICIPATION 
AND THIS WAS ACTUALLY A PROBLEM 
FOR THE OTHER TWO ESPECIALLY MIDGE MACKENZIE WHO WAS VERY FEMINIST 
IN HER APPROACH TO EVERYTHING ALMOST MILITANTLY SO 
AND VERITY AND MIDGE ACTUALLY CLASHED ON THIS POINT 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT 
KEIR HARDIE'S BACK FOR MERTHYR 
SO NOW THERE'S A LABOUR MAN IN PARLIAMENT AGAIN 
AREN'T YOU PLEASED 
NOTHING IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD MEANS ANYTHING TO YOU DOES IT 
CHRISTABEL LISTEN TO ME WELL WHY DOES IT MATTER TELL ME 
BECAUSE WE NEED MEN LIKE K. H. IN PARLIAMENT 
VERITY SAID LOOK WE NEED AN OBJECTIVE VIEW TO ALL THIS 
YOU CAN'T JUST DO A SERIES BEING SYMPATHETIC TO A LOAD OF WOMEN 
WHO WERE TRYING TO FIGHT FOR RIGHTS 
AND SHE INSISTED AND WON 
SHE WAS THE ALCHEMIST 
SHE WANTED TO BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT WHAT SHE WAS PRODUCING 
WAS DELIVERED IN THE WAY THAT SHE EXPECTED SHE WAS VERY TOUGH 
HE CONTINUED HIS ATTACK BY QUOTING FROM AN ARTICLE IN THE LANCET 
OF NINETEEN TWELVE WHICH DEALT WITH THE PRACTICE OF INSERTING A NASAL TUBE 
THE NASAL MUCUS MEMBRANE WAS FREQUENTLY LACERATED AS EVIDENCED BY BLEEDING 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING SHE EVER DID BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF WHAT IT WAS SAYING 
ABOUT THIS COUNTRY ABOUT WOMEN 
ABOUT POLITICS ABOUT THE CLASS SYSTEM ABOUT ALL SORTS OF THINGS 
THIS AMALGAM OF IMPORTANT AFFAIRS AND ELEMENTS 
WAS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO VERITY 
AWAKE AT LAST THEY ARE PREPARED TO DO SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN HAVE NEVER DONE BEFORE 
FIGHT FOR THEMSELVES 
IF WE ARE BRAVE 
AND TRUE 
IS THERE A MAN WHO WILL DENY US 
THE SERIES CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF JEREMY ISAACS 
THAMES T. V.'S HEAD OF PROGRAMMES WHO WAS LOOKING FOR A NEW CONTROLLER OF DRAMA 
I TOLD YOU I WAS GOOD 
I THOUGHT THERE'S A CALLING CARD 
I THOUGHT THAT'S THE KIND OF ORIGINAL MIND I WANT AT WORK 
AT THAMES AND I ASKED HER TO HAVE A DRINK WITH ME IN THE CAFE ROYAL 
AT THE BOTTOM OF REGENT STREET 
AND IT VERY QUICKLY BECAME APPARENT TO ME FIRST OF ALL THAT SHE COULD 
DO THE JOB AND SECONDLY THAT SHE REALLY WOULD LIKE TO DO THE JOB SO I OFFERED HER THE JOB 
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY VERITY COMMISSIONED A NUMBER 
OF CONTROVERSIAL OFTEN RADICAL DRAMAS THAT WOULD BECOME LANDMARKS 
IN BRITISH TELEVISION 
THE NAKED CIVIL SERVANT BASED ON THE LIFE OF GAY ICON QUENTIN CRISP 
WAS THE FIRST OF MANY SUCCESSES AND MADE A STAR OF JOHN HURT 
FOR ME WHAT MEANS A LOT PERSONALLY IS THE NAKED CIVIL SERVANT 
WHICH WOULD STILL BE AN EXTRAORDINARY DRAMA IF YOU SHOWED IT NOW 
THAT WOULD STILL DESERVE ITS SLOT 
AND STILL CAUSE SHOCKWAVES AND BEAR IN MIND THAT WAS TRANSMITTED ON PRIMETIME I. T. V. 
IT HAD BEEN A PROJECT WHICH HAD BEEN AROUND FOR A FEW YEARS 
WITH A WONDERFUL SCRIPT BY PHILIP MACKIE 
WONDERFUL SCRIPT AND NO ONE WOULD TOUCH IT 
IT WAS 
THOUGHT TO BE A DANGEROUS SUBJECT BY THE B. B. C. 
I THINK IT WENT TO THE B. B. C. TWO OR THREE TIMES UNDER DIFFERENT PRODUCERS AND WAS REJECTED 
ARE YOU GONNA BUY ME A CUP OF TEA 
HERE HE'S GONNA BUY ME A CUP OF TEA 
ALL RIGHT THEN WHISPER IN MY EAR 
TELL ME YOU LOVE ME 
WHY DON'T YOU SOD OFF BACK TO HOXTON BEFORE THEY FIND OUT YOU'RE QUEER 
YOU 
IT WAS ALL THOSE LOVELY WORDS LIKE GROUND BREAKING 
AND REALLY 
CONTENTIOUS AT THAT TIME WHICH IS HARD TO BELIEVE NOW 
BUT AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME IT WAS HUGELY SO 
AND IT WAS TAKEN UP BY VERITY 
PASSED ON TO JEREMY ISAACS 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER JEREMY REMEMBERS THIS BUT CERTAINLY HE SAID 
TO VERITY HE SAID LOOK WHATEVER YOU THINK IS RIGHT I'LL BACK 
WHICH IS KIND OF EXTRAORDINARY FOR A STUDIO BOSS AND 
ALTHOUGH THAMES WAS QUITE SMALL I SUPPOSE AT THE TIME 
THEY WENT IN THE FACE OF EVERYTHING AND JUST SAID THIS IS A WONDERFUL PIECE AND IT SHOULD BE MADE 
AND SO THEY MADE IT SIR LOOK AT ME 
I WEAR LIPSTICK I WEAR ROUGE I WEAR MASCARA 
ON MY EYELASHES I DYE MY HAIR I WEAR FLAMBOYANT CLOTHES FAR MORE OUTRE THAN THOSE I'M WEARING NOW 
I AM A SELF EVIDENT SELF PROFESSED EFFEMINATE HOMOSEXUAL FOR ALL THE WORLD TO SEE 
IT'S A MASSIVELY POLITICAL PIECE IT'S NOT WRITTEN OR MADE AS A POLITICAL PIECE 
BUT ITS EXISTENCE IS POLITICAL AND IT STILL STANDS UP NOW 
IT'S STILL BRILLIANT 
VERITY'S FIRST MAJOR SERIES FOR THAMES WAS ALSO A LANDMARK IN POLITICAL DRAMA 
WRITTEN BY LEFT WING PLAYWRIGHT TREVOR GRIFFITHS BILL BRAND 
WAS AN UNCOMPROMISING LOOK AT SOCIALISM AND THE LABOUR PARTY 
IN THE LAST YEAR UNDER A LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
UNEMPLOYMENT HAS RISEN TO CLOSE ON ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION 
THE ELEVEN PART SERIES WHICH WAS WRITTEN BY TREVOR GRIFFITHS 
ABOUT A LABOUR POLITICIAN WAS ACTUALLY VERY RADICAL FOR ITS TIME 
CERTAINLY FOR AN I. T. V. DRAMA YOU KNOW 
THIS WAS A DRAMA ON THE MAIN CHANNEL 
ELEVEN HOURS OF PRIMETIME DRAMA 
A SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT MUST BE PREPARED AT ONCE TO INTRODUCE A SYSTEM OF SPECIAL DEPOSITS 
WE MUST OBLIGE LIFE INSURANCE AND PENSION FUNDS TO INVEST A FRACTION OF THEIR MONEY IN INDUSTRY 
IF NECESSARY BY DIRECT INTERVENTION 
YOU SEE SHE NEVER PARADED HER POLITICAL OPINIONS 
WHEN IT CAME TO COMMISSIONING WORK 
IT WAS WHEN YOU WERE PRIVATE AT A DINNER PARTY OR DINNER THAT YOU 
BEGAN TO REALISE THAT HER POLITICS WERE ACTUALLY QUITE TO THE LEFT 
BUT THAT'S NOT HOW SHE DECIDED ON WHAT TO DO 
I THINK IT MADE HER PARTICULARLY SYMPATHETIC TO TREVOR GRIFFITHS FOR INSTANCE 
YOU HAVE THE REPUTATION OF BEING SOME WAY TO THE LEFT OF CENTRE IN THE LABOUR PARTY MR. BRAND 
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR POLITICS 
COULDN'T YOU ASK ME SOMETHING EASIER 
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE WORK OF CERTAINLY SHOULDER TO SHOULDER 
BILL BRAND IN TERMS OF INTEREST 
YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN CONSTRUCT A POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW 
BUT IT WAS NEVER THROWN IN YOUR FACE 
ROCK FOLLIES HOWARD SCHUMAN'S BITTERSWEET SERIES ABOUT A GIRL GROUP'S RISE TO THE TOP 
OF THE MUSIC BUSINESS COULDN'T HAVE LOOKED OR SOUNDED MORE DIFFERENT 
BUT IT TOO BORE ALL THE HALLMARKS OF A VERITY LAMBERT PRODUCTION 
BRILLIANT BECAUSE JULIE COVINGTON WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF CASTING JULIE COVINGTON 
CHARLOTTE CORNWELL RULA LENSKA 
THE PEOPLE BURSTING INTO SONG USING THE SONGS AS MUSICALS BUT ALSO PUSHING THE STORY ON 
I THINK IT WAS MADE ON TAPE 
IT WAS REALLY BRIGHT AND VIVID AND I SIMPLY LOVED IT 
AND CERTAINLY IN THE CASE OF ROCK FOLLIES WHICH SHE WAS ATTRACTED TO AT FIRST WAS THAT IT WOULD HAVE 
A LOT OF PIZZAZZ BUT SHE LIKED VERY MUCH WHAT WAS GOING ON UNDERNEATH 
PARTICULARLY THE SEXUAL POLITICS 
YOU'RE SO EGOCENTRIC EGOCENTRIC 
YOU DON'T STOP TO CONSIDER HOW I'M GOING TO SUFFER KNOWING 
THAT A MILLION BLOKES WILL BE SEEING PARTS OF YOUR BODY ONLY I SHOULD SEE 
THAT'S MARVELLOUS ISN'T IT LITTLE BY LITTLE YOU'RE CHIPPING AWAY AT MY MASCULINITY 
WHY DON'T YOU FINISH THE JOB WHAT DON'T YOU DO THE JOB PROPERLY AYE 
WHY DON'T YOU GO DOWN TO THE KITCHEN AND GET A KNIFE AND CUT OFF MY MANHOOD 
LISTEN MATE FOR YEARS YOU'VE DOMINATED ME TRACKED YOUR GUM BOOTS 
THROUGH MY SOFT VULNERABLE PSYCHE DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT CASTRATION 
SHE LOVED THE SURFACE BUT SHE ALSO DID LOVE THE POLITICS UNDERNEATH 
SURVIVAL YOU CALL THIS SURVIVAL YES DAMN IT I CALL THIS SURVIVAL 
ANYTHING THAT BRINGS IN THREE SQUARES A DAY IS SURVIVAL 
AND I CALL IT SURVIVAL OH YES IT'S NIGEL'S BUSINESS ADVISER 
AT LONG LAST SHE'S FOUND CERTAINTY FOLKS 
HER CONFUSION A THING OF THE PAST 
NOW SHE'S POSITIVE THAT RIDING THE CAPITALIST EXPLOITATION ROLLERCOASTER IS THE WAY TO SURVIVE 
OH DEE YOU HAVE THIS PATHETIC ILLUSION THAT THERE 
IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN CAPITALISM AND YOUR IDEAL OF ROCK MUSIC 
BUT ROCK IS A CELEBRATION OF CAPITALISM 
AN OLD BOSS OF MINE CYRIL BENNETT 
HAD SAID TO ME JEREMY THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT ARE POISON AT THE BOX OFFICE 
VIEWERS DON'T WANT PROGRAMMES ABOUT POLITICS AND THEY DON'T WANT PROGRAMMES ABOUT SHOWBUSINESS 
HOW WRONG CAN YOU BE 
I SAID TO VERITY VERITY YOU'VE BROUGHT ME EXACTLY THE THINGS WHICH 
SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME ONE SHOULD NEVER BE DOING 
SHE GAVE ME A LOOK AND I SAID O. K. BUT WE'LL DO THEM 
SO WE DID THEM BUT AND THIS IS THE POINT 
SHE KNEW VERY WELL THAT SHE AND I 
BOTH NEEDED TO DELIVER RATINGS TO THAMES AND TO THE I. T. V. NETWORK 
WE WERE THE MAINSTAY OF THE I. T. V. NETWORK'S WEEKDAY SCHEDULE 
THEY WERE BOTH AWARE OF TRICKY SUBJECTS BUT ALSO 
WERE QUITE AWARE OF HOW TO ATTRACT AN AUDIENCE SO I THINK THERE'S 
A DOUBLE ACT FOR DRAMA THAT JEREMY AND VERITY WERE QUITE FORMIDABLE 
EDWARD AND MRS. SIMPSON THE FIRST DRAMA SERIES ABOUT THE ABDICATION 
CRISIS SHOWED THAT VERITY COULD ALSO DELIVER A BIG RATINGS WINNER 
WITH MANY OF THE REAL LIFE PARTICIPANTS STILL ALIVE AND 
A SCRIPT THAT EXPOSED THE POLITICAL STORM BEHIND THE AFFAIR IT TOO WAS A CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT 
BUT YOU MUST 
BELIEVE ME 
WHEN I TELL YOU 
THAT I HAVE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE 
TO CARRY THE HEAVY BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY 
AND TO DISCHARGE MY DUTIES AS KING 
AS I WOULD WISH TO DO 
WITHOUT THE HELP 
AND SUPPORT OF THE WOMAN I LOVE 
WELL ACTUALLY IF YOU EXAMINE IT IT WASN'T A CONVENTIONAL ROYAL DRAMA 
IT WAS SUBVERSIVE 
IN FACT THE PUBLICITY THAT WENT OUT AFTER WE COMPLETED WAS THE GREATEST 
LOVE STORY OF THE CENTURY OR A NATION BETRAYED 
WE WERE QUESTIONING THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF ROYALTY OF WHAT IT 
ACTUALLY REPRESENTED AT THE TIME AND THE POLITICS OF THE TIME 
THERE ARE CERTAIN SOPHISTICATED ELEMENTS IN LONDON WHO FAVOUR IT 
IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO THINK THAT LONDON IS TYPICAL OF THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE 
THE LABOUR PARTY'S IDEAS ARE ROOTED IN THE PROVINCIAL DECENCIES NOT IN METROPOLITAN CHIC 
WE WERE EXAMINING A SOCIETY IN CHANGE SO IT WASN'T JUST 
A COSTUME DRAMA WITH LOTS OF HAIR DOS AND NICE DRESSES 
WE WERE ACTUALLY GETTING TO THE CORE OF SOMETHING UNDERNEATH THIS WHICH 
I THOUGHT WAS ACTUALLY WONDERFUL AND THERE'S A RADICAL ELEMENT THERE 
HAVE YOU SEEN THE PAPERS 
YES I MUST WARN YOU SIR THAT THIS WILL GET WORSE 
THERE WILL BE SENSATIONAL DISCLOSURES IN A LONDON MORNING PAPER 
SO IT'S ABOUT TO BREAK 
WE SPENT A YEAR PREPARING IT AND VERITY GAVE US THAT FREEDOM 
YOU KNOW THESE DAYS NOBODY PREPARES THINGS FOR THAT LENGTH OF TIME 
THE REASON THAT SHE WAS AS GOOD AS SHE WAS WAS THAT COMPROMISE 
WAS NOT A WORD THAT VERITY LIKED OR IT WASN'T IN HER DICTIONARY 
AND SHE ONLY WANTED THE BEST 
AND SHE DROVE HERSELF AND EVERYONE AROUND HER TO DELIVER THE BEST 
AND THE WINNER ROCK FOLLIES 
VERITY WAS ON A WINNING STREAK THE FIRST WAVE OF HER PRODUCTIONS SWEPT THE BOARD 
THE WINNERS ARE 
EDWARD AND MRS. SIMPSON 
AS WELL AS CONTINUING HER ROLE AS HEAD OF DRAMA SHE WAS ALSO PUT IN CHARGE OF EUSTON FILMS 
THE COMPANY SET UP BY THAMES TO MAKE TELEVISION SERIES AND MOVIES SHOT ENTIRELY ON FILM AND ON LOCATION 
THEY'RE VERY MUCH ASSOCIATED WITH LONDON AND WITH THE PARTICULAR KIND 
OF LIFE WORKING CLASS LIFE I GUESS IN LONDON AT THAT TIME SO SHE WANTED 
TO DEVELOP AN IDENTITY I THINK FOR THE TELEVISION DRAMA WHICH WAS BEING 
PRODUCED AT THAMES DURING THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
AND THAT CONTINUED INTO THE FILM DRAMA WHICH WAS BEING PRODUCED BY EUSTON FILMS 
AND I THINK THE FACT THAT IT WAS FILM DRAMA WAS VERY IMPORTANT AS WELL 
AS THAT BROUGHT A NEW DEVELOPMENT 
IT TOOK DRAMA OUT ONTO THE STREETS 
NOW LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT 
MONTY WISEMAN IS PAYING YOU FIVE HUNDRED QUID TO COLLECT A DEAD MATE OF HIS 
AND YOU ARE GONNA KEEP THE BODY IN YOUR SLAUGHTER 
WELL YOU CAN'T TURN DOWN THAT KIND OF DOUGH TERRY 
TELEVISION WHEN IT'S WELL MADE REFLECTS THE SOCIETY REFLECTS WHAT'S GOING ON 
IN THE COUNTRY AT THAT TIME AND CERTAINLY THAT WAS WHAT VERITY AND WE WERE TRYING TO DO 
WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DRAMA WE WERE DOING WAS IN CONTEXT 
IT WAS UP TO OTHERS TO MAKE GREAT PERIOD PIECES NICE CLEAN DRESSES 
AND ALL OF THAT SWANNING AROUND 
WE DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT WE WANTED TO TALK MUCH MORE ABOUT WHAT SOCIETY WAS LIKE 
MINDER IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE 
ALTHOUGH ITS FIRST SERIES WAS NOT AN IMMEDIATE HIT WITH AUDIENCES 
MINDER BECAME VERITY'S MOST SUCCESSFUL AND LONGEST RUNNING SHOW 
AFTER DOCTOR WHO 
AND ARTHUR DALEY PLAYED BY GEORGE COLE VERITY'S PERSONAL CHOICE FOR THE PART 
EMBODIED THE CHANGING POLITICAL TIMES 
WE WANTED A MAN ON THE MAKE IT WAS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL 
THIS WAS THATCHER'S BRITAIN 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
GOING OUT THERE AND DEVIL TAKE THE HINDMOST SO IT WAS ABSOLUTELY 
IMPERATIVE THAT THAT ARTHUR CHARACTER BE RIGHT 
YOU FANCY HER DON'T YOU I DO NOT NOW GET A MOVE ON 
YOU DO YOU SAID TO DAVE 
I SAID IT WAS A MEETING OF MINDS 
THOUGH I DO HAVE TO ADMIT SHE 
SHE DOES HAVE WOMANLY QUALITIES 
YOU'RE DISGUSTING 
IT WAS ALL VERY MUCH HER BABY AND WE ALL HAD A BALL 
IT WAS JUST A WONDERFUL TIME AND IT WASN'T JUST A WONDERFUL TIME FOR US 
IT WAS A WONDERFUL TIME FOR THE VIEWERS AS WELL 
YOU KNOW EUSTON FOR A TINY LITTLE COMPANY MADE AN ENORMOUS REPUTATION FOR ITSELF 
AS A WOMAN IN A MAN'S WORLD SHE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST 
SHE WAS DETERMINED TO CARVE A SWATHE AND THEREFORE SHE WAS ALWAYS LOOKING 
TO SURROUND HERSELF AND TO ENCOURAGE OTHER WOMEN 
TO SURROUND HERSELF WITH LIKE MINDED PEOPLE AND INEVITABLY WHAT GREW UP 
AROUND HER WAS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTOOD HER 
AND UNDERSTOOD THE KIND OF SUBJECT MATTER SHE WAS INTERESTED IN 
THAT LAST ONE WAS A D. A. 
OH D. A. 
DELAYED ACTION THAT'S THE SORT YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH DON'T YOU 
YES YES 
WE CALL THEM UXBS 
OH 
UNEXPLODED BOMBS 
OH THAT'S NICE SOMETHING TO TELL MY FRIENDS IN THE MORNING WHAT 
SOMETHING TO TELL THEM ABOUT IN THE MORNING WHO YOU 
IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME AT ALL THAT SHE BECAME ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO CHAMPIONED 
SHE WAS VERY ATTRACTIVE IN MANY WAYS 
I MEAN ONCE PEOPLE GOT PAST THIS RATHER FORMIDABLE IMAGE THAT SHE HAD 
SHE WASN'T SCARED OF BEING A WOMAN BUT 
SHE WAS FULL OF PRIDE AT BEING ABLE TO PUSH THE WOMAN'S CAUSE 
THE INTERESTING THING WHEN I WAS HEAD OF DRAMA WAS THE BALANCE IN MY DEPARTMENT BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN 
THERE SHOULDN'T BE ALL WOMEN AND THERE SHOULDN'T BE ALL MEN 
IT SHOULD BE SORT OF FIFTY FIFTY T. H. S. BUT THERE CAME A POINT I THINK 
WHEN I WAS RECRUITING AT THAMES WHERE IT WAS QUITE DIFFICULT 
TO KEEP IT FIFTY FIFTY T. H. S. BECAUSE THE WOMEN WHO CAME TO SEE ME 
WERE VERY OFTEN SO IMPRESSIVE THAT YOU HAD TO EMPLOY THEM 
I THOUGHT WE'D HAVE TO REALLY TRY AND GET SERIOUS WITH WOMEN PROTAGONISTS 
WOMEN HEROES AND THIS TREATMENT CAME INTO ME CALLED WIDOWS 
AND IT WAS BY LYNDA LA PLANTE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL 
WIDOWS WAS LYNDA LA PLANTE AS SHE WAS THEN ACTRESS COMING IN WITH THIS IDEA WHICH SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T 
THINK SHE COULD WRITE BUT SHE QUITE LIKED THE IDEA AND WE SAT DOWN AND SAID WELL YOU WILL DO IT 
WHY WOULD YOU NOT SO WE COMMISSIONED HER TO DO IT 
AND SHE SAID WELL YOU'LL PROBABLY NEED ANOTHER WRITER 
AND WE PLODDED ON AND PLODDED ON AND PLODDED ON AND SOME OF THE EPISODES 
CAME IN LIKE YELLOW PAGES THEY WERE SO THICK BECAUSE SHE WAS WRITING AND WRITING AND WRITING 
HERE NOW LISTEN 
HARRY PLANS JOBS MONTHS IN ADVANCE ALL WRITTEN DOWN 
SO IF THE FISHERS COULD GET THEIR HANDS ON THE LEDGERS THEY COULD STAY ON TOP JUST LIKE HARRY DID 
WELL HOW MUCH HAVE THEY OFFERED FOR THEM 
THEY'RE PREPARED TO OFFER US A PERCENTAGE 
THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE IF I DON'T SELL LIKE WHAT 
WE DO IT 
WE PULL THE NEXT BIG ONE HARRY LINED UP 
HER GENIUS WAS AS AN EDITOR SHE HAD THE NOSE SO SHE GOT THE PROJECT 
BUT AS AN EDITOR IN THOSE DAYS SHE WAS SUPERLATIVE 
EVERYTHING SHE TAUGHT ME THEN I TRY AND PASS ON TO THE WRITERS THAT I BRING INTO MY COMPANY 
AND MOST IMPORTANT 
VERITY DID NOT WANT TO WRITE THE SCRIPT 
SHE KNEW INSTINCTIVELY THAT THERE WAS 
I FIND IT QUITE DIFFICULT ACTUALLY SHE JUST KNEW 
SHE WOULD SAY 
RIGHT LYNDA WHO'S YOUR LEADING ROLE 
AND I SAID WELL DONNY RAWLINGS SHE SAID DONNY RAWLINGS 
YOU KNOW YOU HAVEN'T BROUGHT HER IN UNTIL PAGE FORTY 
I SAID HAVEN'T I SHE NEVER SAID LYNDA YOUR FIRST EPISODE IS ACTUALLY TWO HUNDRED PAGES OVER LENGTH 
THERE WASN'T A QUESTION OF THAT 
SHE NEVER MADE ME FEEL STUPID SHE NEVER MADE ME FEEL INADEQUATE 
SHE SIMPLY PASSED ON ENCOURAGING REMARKS 
THAT WERE LIKE JEWELS 
YOU TWO HAD BETTER GET YOURSELF WHEELS GOOD ONES 
GET THEM FROM AUCTIONS 
USE ASSUMED NAMES MAKE SURE THEY'RE TAXED AND MOT'D AND STRAIGHT O. K. 
RIGHT 
KEYS TO THIS PLACE 
BE CAREFUL HOW YOU COME AND GO 
FROM NOW ON THIS PLACE WILL BE HEADQUARTERS LINDA 
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE LOVE 
IN OR OUT 
GOOD GIRL 
THE TREATMENT THAT LYNDA GAVE ME 
INITIALLY THEY WERE CAUGHT AT THE END AND ANYWAY I GAVE IT TO LINDA AGRAN 
TO READ WHO AGREED WITH ME AND SAID SHE THOUGHT IT WAS TERRIFIC AND I SAID THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM 
THEY'VE GOT TO GET AWAY WITH IT THEY CAN'T GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS AND NOT GET AWAY WITH IT I WON'T HAVE IT 
I TRUTHFULLY OWE 
MY CAREER TO VERITY LAMBERT 
BECAUSE OF HER AUDACIOUSNESS 
BECAUSE IT WAS VERITY LAMBERT WHO SAID LET THEM GET AWAY WITH IT 
COS I WAS EDITING MYSELF SAYING I DO NOT THINK A COMPANY 
WOULD ALLOW FOUR WOMEN TO PULL AN ARMED ROBBERY AND GET AWAY WITH IT 
VERITY LAMBERT SAID RUBBISH 
LET THEM GET AWAY LET THEM GO 
LET THEM FLY 
AND THAT MADE IT EVEN MORE EXCITING 
AS I SAID SHE WAS MY MENTOR 
I LOVED HER 
THE ONE THING ABOUT VERITY SHE HAD TREMENDOUS ENERGY 
SHE WANTED THINGS TO HAPPEN QUICKLY AND BACK IN THE SEVENTIES CERTAINLY YOU COULD SEE THAT ENERGY 
THAT ENERGY WOULD BE CONVERTED INTO DECISIONS BEING MADE QUICKLY SO THERE WAS 
A LINE BETWEEN HER ENERGY THE CREATIVE ENERGY AND THE PRODUCT THAT WAS BEING MADE AT THAMES 
AND I DON'T THINK ANYTHING WAS EVER AS HAPPY AS THAT TIME FOR HER 
VERITY WAS NOW THE MOST POWERFUL AND RESPECTED FEMALE EXECUTIVE IN BRITISH TELEVISION 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE E. M. I. FILMS INVITED HER TO BECOME ITS HEAD OF PRODUCTION 
ONE OF THE HIGHEST PROFILE JOBS IN BRITISH CINEMA 
NEVER ONE TO REFUSE A CHALLENGE VERITY KNEW SHE WAS TAKING ON THE INDUSTRY'S TOUGHEST ROLE 
I HATE TO YES I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE BRITISH FILMS 
VERITY LET'S GET THE SEXIST STUFF OVER TO START WITH 
YOU ARE THE FIRST WOMAN EVER I THINK TO BE HEAD OF PRODUCTION 
IN ANY STUDIO OR ANY COMPANY IN THIS COUNTRY 
NOW JUST BEFORE YOU TOOK OVER E. M. I. OR THORN E. M. I. HAD MADE 
A SUCCESSION OF AMBITIOUS BUT VERY EXPENSIVE FLOPS 
NOW ARE YOU GOING TO GO IN NOT OBVIOUSLY FOR FLOPS BUT ARE YOU ALSO 
GOING TO GO IN FOR VERY AMBITIOUS AND VERY BIG EXPENSIVE PROJECTS 
I DON'T SEE MYSELF GOING IN FOR PROJECTS WHICH COST MEGABUCKS 
I THINK INITIALLY ANYWAY I'D LIKE TO CONCENTRATE ON 
WHAT I CALL MEDIUM BUDGET PICTURES WHERE YOU HAVE A CHANCE OF CONTROLLING THE BUDGET IT DOESN'T 
START TO RUN YOU AND WHERE NOBODY IS TOO FRIGHTENED BECAUSE OF THE MONEY OF OPERATING IN A CREATIVE MANNER 
VERITY WAS VERY KEEN TO DO THAT JOB 
SHE WANTED TO GET INTO MOVIES AND THAT WAS SOMETHING I THINK THAT 
WAS VERY MUCH PART OF THE ETHOS OF THE TIME 
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUCCESSFUL DRAMA PRODUCERS WANTED TO DO MOVIES 
BUT I THINK THAT WHOLE EDIFICE BORE VERY HEAVILY ON HER SHOULDERS 
SHE WAS ALSO THERE IN A VERY DIFFICULT TIME AND DIDN'T KNOW 
YOU KNOW WHO WANTED TO OWN WHAT AND WHETHER IT WOULD BE SOLD NEXT WEEK AND IN FACT SHE WENT THROUGH 
A COUPLE OF CHANGES OF OWNERSHIP AND ALSO I THINK SHE WAS UNLUCKY THAT 
ONE OR TWO OF THE FILMS WELL QUITE FRANKLY BOMBED 
ALTHOUGH PERHAPS NOT THE HITS SHE HAD HOPED FOR 
VERITY'S FILMS SHOWED A GENUINE COMMITMENT TO BRITISH CINEMA 
IT WAS LATER DESCRIBED THE E. M. I. EXPERIENCE AS ONE 
OF THE UNHAPPIEST AND MOST FRUSTRATING OF HER CAREER 
I THINK THE GREATEST FRUSTRATION FOR HER MUST HAVE BEEN HOW SLOW EVERYTHING WAS 
AND THAT WHEREAS IN TELEVISION ON THE WHOLE IF SHE MADE A DECISION 
THE PROJECT WOULD HAPPEN AND IT WOULD HAPPEN RELATIVELY QUICKLY AND SHE HAD A KIND OF INDEPENDENCE 
I THINK ONCE SHE GOT INTO FILM SHE FACED THE PROBLEM THAT EVERYONE IN FILM FACES WHICH 
ARE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO COULD BLOCK YOUR DECISIONS AND IT WAS EASIER TO SAY NO THAN TO SAY YES 
IN TELEVISION YOU'VE GOT A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE BASICALLY AND THERE'S A TELEVISION IN ALMOST EVERYONE'S ROOM 
IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK AFTER SIX WEEKS OR AT THE MOST TWELVE 
IT'S GONE AND AFTER ABOUT ANOTHER TWELVE IT'S PROBABLY FORGOTTEN AND YOU GET ANOTHER CHANCE 
IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK TO BEGIN WITH YOU EVEN HAVE A CHANCE 
TO BUILD ON IT BUT WITH FILMS YOU'VE GOT TO PERSUADE PEOPLE TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES 
TO GO INTO THE CINEMA AND ALSO YOU ONLY HAVE ONE CHANCE 
YOU CAN'T SAY IT DIDN'T REALLY QUITE WORK THIS TIME WE'LL DO IT AGAIN AND IT'LL WORK NEXT TIME 
VERITY LEFT E. M. I. AFTER THREE YEARS AND SET UP HER OWN INDEPENDENT COMPANY 
HER FIRST SOLO FEATURE A CRY IN THE DARK 
WAS THE CRITICAL AND BOX OFFICE SUCCESS THAT HAD ELUDED HER 
AT E. M. I. WINNING A BEST ACTRESS AWARD FOR ITS STAR MERYL STREEP 
AND WHEN SHE RETURNED TO HER OLD FAMILIAR WORLD OF TELEVISION PRODUCTION IT WAS NOT ONLY IN 
A NEW ROLE AS INDEPENDENT PRODUCER BUT IN AN ENTIRELY NEW GENRE 
AND WITH A WRITER NEW TO TELEVISION 
WHAT A GROUNDING THAT WAS FOR MY FIRST SHOW 
FROM MAY TO SEPTEMBER WAS HER FIRST PRODUCTION AND HER FIRST EVER SITCOM 
SO WE WERE BOTH NOVICES IN SITCOM 
EXCEPT SHE HAD THIS MASSIVE BACKGROUND AND I WAS JUST A NOVICE 
MRS. ANGEL 
YES HELLO 
PLEASE TAKE A SEAT THANK YOU 
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT 
CAN I TAKE YOUR COAT WHAT AS A DOWN PAYMENT SORRY 
SORRY 
I MAKE JOKES WHEN I'M NERVOUS 
NOT VERY GOOD ONES 
I THINK HER INSTINCTS WERE PERFECT BECAUSE COMEDY THE BEST 
COMEDY HAS TO COME FROM TRUTH AND SHE WOULD GO FOR THE EMOTIONAL TRUTH 
AND I MEAN MAY TO DECEMBER ALTHOUGH IT WAS HOPEFULLY FUNNY WAS ALL BASED 
IN A RELATIONSHIP AND BASED IN THE HUMOUR OR REAL LIFE AND REAL EMOTION 
ANYWAY SMALL TALK 
NOW THE PYJAMA GAME SORRY 
SMALL TALK IT'S FROM THE PYJAMA GAME 
OH YES YES I SEE 
NOW THEN OF THEE I SING 
OH GEORGE GERSHWIN THAT'S RIGHT BABES IN ARMS 
OH ROGERS AND HAMM 
NO ROGERS AND HART 
THIS'LL FOX YOU DIVORCE ME DARLING OOH 
BUT EVEN SO HAUNT ME HAD THE BASIS OF A RELATIONSHIP IN IT 
SO SHE CAME FROM THE SAME WAY 
AS ONE WOULD COME FROM DRAMA BUT JUST IT WAS DRAMA THAT WAS 
WANTING TO MAKE YOU LAUGH AND YOU LAUGH MORE WHEN YOU CARE 
I THINK ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE DOING FAMILY MAINSTREAM COMEDY I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY QUITE IMPORTANT THAT 
YOU CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS AND SHE TAUGHT ME THAT 
YOUNG PEOPLE THEY DON'T SCARE LIKE THEY USED TO IT'S ALL THIS VIDEO 
AT MY AGE I SHOULD COMPETE WITH HOLLYWOOD 
I'M GOING TO SCREAM THEN YOU'LL DISAPPEAR 
YOU'RE JUST A FIGMENT OF MY IMAGINATION 
SUCH LONG WORDS SHE USES 
IF YOU COULD DO THE STAR OF DAVID THEN I'D BE IMPRESSED 
I MEAN SHE WAS LIKE A JEWISH MOTHER EXCEPT HER BABIES WERE HER PROJECTS 
I MADE YOU THIS GRANNY FROM MY IMAGINATION 
I CAN'T STAND IT SAL 
O. K. MRS. FELDMAN NOW I'M HERE COME ON DESTROY ME 
SORRY SORRY TOM 
CUT CUT 
GET THAT BLOODY WRITER OUT OF THE ROOM 
BUT WHILE VERITY NURTURED AND ENCOURAGED NEW WRITERS SHE COULD BE RUTHLESS WITH OLD ESTABLISHED ONES 
I SAT IN HER OFFICE IN SHEPHERD'S BUSH WITH HER FROM MONDAY TO FRIDAY 
OF A WEEK AND WE TOOK OUT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT PAGES 
AND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SCENES 
AND BY THE WEDNESDAY NIGHT I DID SAY 
THAT I WAS CONTEMPLATING MURDERING HER AND PETER 
ACTUALLY WENT AND TOLD VERITY AND I THINK VERITY WASN'T QUITE SURE WHETHER I WAS SERIOUS OR NOT 
BUT SHE WAS MURDERING MY BABIES 
EXTERMINATE EXTERMINATE 
A YEAR LATER WHEN WE'D FILMED IT I DIDN'T MISS ANY OF THOSE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT PAGES OR ANY OF THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SCENES 
YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF 
AFTER WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH YOU DESERVE HER 
RIGHT THIS IS YOUR REWARD 
COLLECT YOURSELF 
AND COLLECT HER 
GO PAST GO DO NOT STOP 
GO PAST GO DO NOT STOP GO PAST GO DO NOT STOP GO PAST GO 
DO NOT STOP OH YEAH 
HEY I FEEL GOOD 
COME IN 
COME IN MICHAEL THE DOOR'S OPEN 
THE WRITERS LOVED HER 
THERE WERE NO SCRIPT EDITORS EVER 
WHICH THESE DAYS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO WORK YOUR WAY THROUGH A WHOLE 
PHALANX OF PEOPLE AND COMMITTEES 
AND ONE THING AND ANOTHER BUT VERITY ALWAYS WORKED ONE TO ONE SO USUALLY AT LUNCH YOU WOULD 
DISCUSS THE IDEA WITH HER AND THEN YOU'D GO AWAY AND WRITE IT AND THEN 
THERE WOULD BE LOTS AND LOTS OF MEETINGS USUALLY IN HER FLAT 
WHERE WE WENT THROUGH THE SCRIPT AND SHE WAS VERY SHARP 
THE B. B. C. WERE CONFIDENT WITH VERITY AT THE HELM AND THE CREATORS OF EASTENDERS BEHIND IT 
THEIR MAJOR INVESTMENT IN HER NEW SOAP OPERA WOULD PRODUCE A MASSIVE RATINGS WINNER 
EL DORADO WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER ULTIMATELY AND I THINK 
IT WAS BECAUSE THE B. B. C. RUSHED IT TO AIR FASTER THAN IT SHOULD BE 
I'M NOT QUITE SURE IF IT WAS RIGHT BUT I THINK THEY PULLED IT FORWARD 
SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO GET EVERYTHING SET IN PLACE BEFORE THEY STARTED 
THIS IS MY WIFE FIZ 
ALL RIGHT I STILL THINK EL DORADO WAS A TERRIFIC IDEA 
IT WAS JUST THE WAY IT WAS DONE EVEN DOWN TO THE FACT THAT 
IT WAS FILMED IN SPAIN AND ALL THOSE CLACKY TILED FLOORS 
PUT THAT AWAY 
EVERYTHING ECHOED IN IT EVERYTHING BOUNCED OFF SURFACES AND YOU COULDN'T EVEN 
YOU WERE SITTING WITH YOUR EAR TOWARDS THE TELEVISION AND THEN 
YOU GOT PEOPLE WHO BECAUSE THEY CAME FROM DIFFERENT COUNTIES COULDN'T COMMUNICATE PARTICULARLY WELL 
YES WHERE YOU'RE CONCERNED AND THE ACTING WAS FANTASTICALLY PATCHY 
OH WHAT A BEAUTIFUL MORNING OH WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY 
IT BECAME ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WAS SO BAD IT WAS GOOD AND PEOPLE WATCHED IT BECAUSE OF IT I THINK 
THAT'S YOU AND ME THAT IS THE NEWSPAPERS WERE PARTICULARLY 
CRUEL AND OTHER PEOPLE IN TELEVISION WEREN'T RUNNING TO SUPPORT HER 
EITHER AND I THINK THEY EXACTED A FAIR AMOUNT OF REVENGE ON HER 
IF YOU WERE A BAD T. V. PRODUCER 
OR EVEN A NOT PARTICULARLY GOOD ONE I'D BELIEVE WHAT YOU WERE SAYING 
I'D BELIEVE COMPLETELY THAT YOU'RE EARNEST IN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING 
BUT ONE OF THE KIND OF TOP FIVE YOU'RE VERY VERY GOOD 
AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE EXCUSING YOURSELF WITH THESE SORT OF 
I'M NOT TRYING TO EXCUSE MYSELF I'M VERY SORRY IF I APPEAR TO BE EXCUSING MYSELF 
I HAVE TO TELL YOU I TOTALLY BELIEVE WHAT I'M SAYING 
WHAT I AM SAYING TO YOU AS CRITICS IS I DO NOT KNOW 
FIRST OF ALL I DON'T THINK YOU PARTICULARLY CARE ABOUT THE MEDIUM 
THAT YOU WRITE ABOUT THEN YOU THINK BASICALLY IT'S A JOLLY GOOD WAY OF MAKING A FEW JOKES 
IF I GAVE EL DORADO A GOOD REVIEW AT ANY TIME THEN WHY WOULDN'T I GIVE IT 
I'M NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE GIVING IT BAD REVIEWS 
YOU ARE NO I'M NOT IT'S THE ATTITUDE THAT EXISTS 
WHICH IS WHICH SAYS IT IS BAD 
I MEAN YOU WANT US TO SAY IS IT'S VERY GOOD WHICH I THINK IS PATRONISING AND I THINK TRIVIALISES 
WHAT YOU WRITE ABOUT AND I DON'T MEAN JUST ON EL DORADO 
YOU KNOW IN A TERRIBLE WAY 
AND I MAY BE BEING PARANOID 
BUT IT WAS ALMOST THE FALL A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE QUITE HAPPY TO SEE 
AND I HATE TO SAY THAT BUT I WENT OUT TO VISIT VERITY WHEN SHE WAS MAKING EL DORADO 
SHE DIDN'T SET OUT TO MAKE A SOAP THAT WAS GOING TO FAIL 
AND SHE AGAIN VERY BRAVELY CHOSE TO SET IT WHERE SHE DID 
SO IT WASN'T COSY IT WASN'T COMFORTABLE 
AND THERE IS A VERY STRONG ARGUMENT 
TO BE MADE THAT IF IT HAD CARRIED ON AND BEEN ALLOWED TO SHIFT AND CHANGE 
AS THEY ALL DO IT COULD WELL HAVE SUCCEEDED 
THERE'S A HUGE INVESTMENT FOR AN INDEPENDENT COMPANY LIKE CINEMA VERITY TO BE BACKING 
AND MAKING A SOAP OPERA LIKE EL DORADO AND I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH EL DORADO 
AND VERITY ADMITTED THIS WAS THAT IT WAS PUT INTO PRODUCTION TOO QUICKLY 
IN A WAY I THINK IT SUFFERED FROM THE PRESSURES WHICH WERE BEGINNING 
TO IMPINGE UPON TELEVISION DRAMA IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES AND THEY WERE THE PRESSURES 
TOWARDS GETTING RATINGS YOU KNOW GETTING AUDIENCES 
THE FAILURE OF EL DORADO WAS A BLOW 
TO VERITY'S REPUTATION AND ALTHOUGH SHE WAS TO CONTINUE 
PRODUCING QUALITY SERIES 
INCLUDING THE WAR TIME DRAMA THE CAZALETS AND TWO SEQUELS TO WIDOWS 
THE EXPERIENCE WAS AN OMEN OF THE WAY TELEVISION WAS TO CHANGE OVER THE COMING DECADE 
THE PRIDE OF THE ARTIST IS AT STAKE 
THE COMMITTEES HAD STARTED AT THE B. B. C. AND THE WHOLE STRUCTURE THING 
HAD CHANGED COMPLETELY AND THE AMOUNT 
OF APPROVAL TO GET ANYTHING ON 
WAS SO MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE THAN IT USED TO BE 
IN OLD DAYS THE PRODUCER SAID WHAT SHE WANTED TO DO COMMISSIONED IT 
AND GOT ON WITH IT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT THAT WAS BETTER 
BUT WHEN ALL THAT STARTED AND THE B. B. C. WERE WORKING ON THE CAZELETS 
SHE SHIELDED YOU FROM THAT 
I MEAN SHE WAS THE ONE WHO DEALT WITH ALL THAT 
WHEN SHE STARTED AND ONCE SHE WAS ALLOWED TO BE 
A PRODUCER AND HER SHOW WAS GREEN LIT SHE WAS MORE OR LESS 
GIVEN TOTAL FREEDOM IN HER CHOICE OF PERSONNEL 
IN THE LATTER YEARS THAT SHE WAS WORKING RIGHT UP TO THE END 
SHE COULD NOT USE A LOT OF PEOPLE SHE WANTED TO 
IN FACT SHE SAID TO ME WARIS I'D LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU BUT I'M NOT ABLE TO 
SHE BECAME WHAT IS NOW KNOWN AS A JOBBING PRODUCER 
WHICH IS NOT THE SAME THING AS THE PERSON SHE USED TO BE 
IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT VERITY JOINED THE HIT B. B. C. COMEDY DRAMA JONATHAN CREEK 
AS ITS NEW SERIES PRODUCER 
SHE WOULD WORK WITH THE SHOW'S CREATOR DAVID RENWICK ON CREEK 
AND LATER LOVE SOUP FOR HER LAST REMAINING YEARS 
SHE BECAME A B. B. C. PRODUCER AGAIN 
WHICH SHE HAD BEEN IN THE SIXTIES YOU KNOW SO MAYBE SHE QUITE LIKED THAT 
SHE USED TO HAVE A NICE OFFICE THE CINEMA VERITY OFFICES 
BUT SHE GOT RID OF THOSE 
I GOT ONE OF THE SOFAS FROM RECEPTION WHICH IS A KIND 
OF LIME GREEN AFFAIR WITH PINK AND WHITE FLECKS ON IT 
IT WAS A TERENCE CONRAN SOFA 
SHE GAVE ME THAT SO I USED TO SIT ON THAT THINKING ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE HAVE SAT ON HERE 
DALEKS EVERYTHING BUT 
I THINK SHE MAYBE JUST QUITE LIKED PRODUCING AGAIN DOING A PROPER JOB 
SHE DID A GREAT JOB TOO 
YOUR WHAT 
MY BADGER WATCH IS THAT LIKE A MICKEY MOUSE WATCH 
MY LOCAL NATURAL HISTORY GROUP 
A COUPLE OF TIMES A YEAR AFTER DARK WE PUT SOME FOOD DOWN AND WE ALL GO 
AND SIT AND HIDE AND WAIT FOR THE BADGERS TO COME OUT AND FEED 
WHY 
BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY FASCINATING CREATURES YOU SHOULD COME ALONG 
SOME TIME AND CHECK IT OUT 
SO IT'S LIKE COUNTRY STUFF 
RIGHT COUNTRY STUFF 
AND ON THE OTHER HAND IT DOES INVOLVE A LOT OF PATIENCE AND 
THE NEED TO STAY SILENT FOR A VERY LONG TIME SO IT'S PROBABLY NOT YOUR SCENE MEANING WHAT 
SORRY 
MEANING BECAUSE I'M AN INTOLERANT GAS BAG WHO CAN'T KEEP HER TRAP SHUT 
FOR MORE THAN FIVE SECONDS AT A TIME 
SHE WAS JUST FORMIDABLE AND THE RESERVES OF 
FORTITUDE THE RESILIENCE AND THE SHEER STOICISM WITH WHICH SHE BORE 
ALL THE KNOCKS AND PARTICULARLY HER ILLNESS 
ALWAYS HER FIRST PRIORITY WAS THE PRODUCTION 
AND SHE RANG ME UP ONCE TO TALK ABOUT WHATEVER IT WAS 
PUBLICITY PHOTOS OR SOMETHING AND I SAID ARE YOU IN THE OFFICE 
NO I'M HAVING A BLOOD TRANSFUSION AT THE MOMENT 
IT WAS THAT KIND OF AND IT WAS JUST INCREDIBLE REALLY BECAUSE I CAN'T EVER 
I MEAN IT JUST PULLS APART FROM HOW I WOULD RESPOND AND BEHAVE 
IN THAT SORT OF SITUATION 
AND I HAVE JUST NOTHING BUT SORT OF ENVY AND RESPECT FOR HER 
NO ONE ELSE REALLY CAN MATCH THOSE STANDARDS 
IT'S THE ENERGY SHE BRINGS TO IT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY QUITE PHENOMENAL 
FOR SOMEBODY IN THEIR SIXTIES TO BE STILL EVERY MORNING 
LAUGHING JOKING ON THE SET 
SHE WAS QUITE AN INSPIRATION 
SHE WAS THERE BECAUSE SHE LOVED IT SHE NEVER MISSED A DAY ON SET 
APART FROM ON THIS LAST SERIES OF LOVE SOUP WHEN SHE WAS VERY ILL 
AND AMAZINGLY NEVER TOLD ANYBODY BUT SHE WAS 
YOU KNOW DIRECTORS ARE ALWAYS THERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE THERE AND 
WRITERS ARE SOMETIMES THERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY LIKE TO MEDDLE 
AND PRODUCERS ARE OFTEN THERE BECAUSE THERE'S A SORT OF A LEVEL 
OF POWER OR WANTING TO MAKE THEIR MARK OR FOR WHATEVER REASON 
BUT SHE SEEMED TO BE THERE BECAUSE 
I MEAN I'M SURE THERE WAS A LEVEL OF POWER AND MAKE HER MARK AS WELL 
BUT SHE WAS THERE BECAUSE SHE HAD A HEART FOR IT AND SHE'D GET UP 
AT FIVE A M. TO WALK HER DOG AND THEN BE READY TO COME ON SET FOR SIX THIRTY A M. 
AND IT WAS HARD ENOUGH FOR EVERYBODY ELSE HAVING TO BE THERE 
BUT SHE WAS THERE AND WHAT WAS BRILLIANT ABOUT HER WAS THAT SHE WAS AN INCREDIBLY LOYAL HEAD 
I HAVE TO SAY OVER THE ENSUING TEN YEARS IN WHICH I WORKED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY WITH HER 
I JUST COULD NOT HAVE HAD A SORT OF STRONGER MORE RECEPTIVE SOUL MATE 
ARTISTICALLY CREATIVELY AND SHE WAS JUST THE MOST WONDERFUL FRIEND 
OF COURSE WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT SO HARD TO BE SORT OF SITTING HERE TALKING ABOUT HER IN THE PAST TENSE 
YOU KNOW IT WAS JUST ONE OF THE MOST AWFUL BLOWS 
TO LOSE WHAT WAS WHAT YOU HAD COME TO REGARD AS A PERMANENT FIXTURE IN MY LIFE REALLY 
I DON'T THINK I REALISED THAT AT THE TIME JUST HOW BLESSED 
WE WERE TO HAVE HER IN THAT ROLE BECAUSE IT'S ALL GOOD AND WELL BEING 
THAT IMPORTANT COG IN THAT HUGE MACHINE AND THE LEVEL THAT SHE'D REACHED BUT WHEN YOU WORK WITH 
SOMEONE WHEN THEY CHOOSE TO BE THERE BECAUSE IT'S A PASSION SOMETHING THAT REALLY COMES FROM THEIR HEART 
YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW IT WHILE YOU'RE DOING IT 
AND ONLY AFTERWARDS IN REFLECTION YOU SEE HOW BLESSED WE WERE 
HOW DO YOU EVER COPE 
I'M STILL NO CLOSER TO KNOWING 
NOT ONLY WITH THE FACT THAT SOMEONE DOESN'T EXIST ANY MORE 
BUT TRYING TO RETRIEVE WHAT DID EXIST 
AND TIME JUST CONTINUES TO DIM THE MEMORIES 
AND EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU THAT WAS SO SPECIAL 
I CAN FEEL SLIPPING AWAY FROM ME YEAR BY YEAR 
LIKE A WOUND THAT YOU NEVER WANT TO HEAL 
IT'S THE ONLY WAY I SUPPOSE 
LIFE CAN GO ON 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR STOPPING BY IN THIS GARDEN OF REMEMBRANCE 
AND ETERNAL PEACE 
AND TRY NOT TO GRIEVE TOO MUCH 
FOR THOSE WHO HAVE PASSED ON TO A BETTER LIFE 
WHATEVER VERITY HAD CHOSEN TO DO SHE WOULD 
HAVE SUCCEEDED AT IT BECAUSE SHE WAS UTTERLY DETERMINED AND UTTERLY CONFIDENT OF HER OWN TALENTS 
SHE WAS PRODUCING GOOD DRAMA FROM THE DAY SHE STARTED NOT ALL THAT LONG AFTER SHE'D BEEN 
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT AND SHE WAS PRODUCING GOOD DRAMA UNTIL THE DAY SHE DIED 
THEY JUST HAD SO MUCH IDENTITY THOSE PROGRAMMES 
IT'S LIKE HOW MUCH OF A TELEVISION DRAMA IS BLAND NINETY PER CENT OF IT 
AND THEN THE OTHER TEN PER CENT COMES ALONG AND IT HAS AN IDENTITY AND A VOICE 
AND THAT'S REALLY A MARK OF GENIUS 
I DON'T KNOW THE INS AND OUTS OF ALL THE OTHER PROJECTS THAT SHE HAD BUT I MEAN ONE ONLY NEEDS TO LOOK 
AT THEM AND PEOPLE WILL JUST SING HER PRAISES ALL THE TIME 
SHE'S A BIT LIKE THE MAGISTRATE IN NAKED CIVIL SERVANT 
WHO SAYS I'M TIRED OF HEARING THESE PRAISES OF YOUR CHARACTER 
CASE DISMISSED
