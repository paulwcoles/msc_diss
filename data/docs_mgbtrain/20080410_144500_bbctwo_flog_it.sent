I'M ON THE CAMBRIDGE BACKS A STRETCH OF RIVER WHICH PASSES 
SOME OF THE OLDEST COLLEGE BUILDINGS IN THE COUNTRY 
THE ARCHITECTURE IS AMAZING 
LATER ON IN THE SHOW WE'LL BE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT SOME OF THESE FINE EXAMPLES 
BUT RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO TIME FOR MESSING ABOUT ON THE RIVER 
BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO FIND TREASURE ON DRY LAND 
CAMBRIDGE IS A THRIVING BUSTLING CITY WITH A LARGE STUDENT POPULATION AND AN INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION 
WE'RE EXPECTING GREAT THINGS FROM OUR VALUATION DAY TODAY 
AND OUR EXPERTS JAMES LEWIS AND ELIZABETH TALBOT 
ARE ALREADY BUSY UNCOVERING SOME OF THE STORIES BEHIND THE ANTIQUES 
THE QUEUE IS MASSIVE JUST LOOK AT THE LENGTH OF THAT 
WE'VE GOT A VERY BUSY DAY AHEAD OF US SO LET'S GET THE SHOW ON THE ROAD 
NOW SHEILA I FOUND YOU IN THE QUEUE OUTSIDE WITH THAT 
I TOOK TO IT STRAIGHT AWAY IT'S A LOVELY LOVELY THING 
TELL ME ABOUT IT WELL I FANCIED IT ABOUT FORTY YEARS AGO IN A LITTLE JUNK SHOP IN BURWELL 
IT WAS TWO AND SIX QUITE A LOT OF MONEY AT THE TIME 
I'VE LOOKED AFTER IT EVER SINCE 
IT HASN'T COME TO ANY GRIEF FORTUNATELY IT'S IN GOOD ORDER IT'S LOVELY I HAVE USED IT 
THIS IS A GREAT THING DOULTON WAS ONE OF THE MOST PROLIFIC FACTORIES OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
THEY MADE ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING 
IT'S FUNNY PEOPLE OFTEN COME TO ME AND SAY I'VE GOT A BIT OF DOULTON IT MUST BE WORTH SOMETHING 
I HAVE TO SAY MOST OF THE TIME YOU DISAPPOINT THEM BY SAYING WELL IT'S TEN FIFTEEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
AS I SAY DOULTON MADE EVERYTHING 
THEY MADE THINGS FROM THESE ART POTTERY AND PIECES SUCH AS THIS 
RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH TO PUBLIC TOILETS AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN 
THEY LITERALLY DID THEY WERE SUCH A DIVERSE FACTORY 
IT'S A REAL SHAME THAT THEY'VE BEEN GOING FOR SUCH A LONG 
TIME EMPLOYING PEOPLE IN BRITAIN AND NOW THEY'VE JUST SENT ALL THEIR WORK TO THE FAR EAST 
DOULTON HAVE BEEN AROUND IN LAMBETH 
YES LAMBETH 
THIS IS A LAMBETH EXAMPLE 
THEY WERE EMPLOYING BRITISH ARTISTS AND WORKERS FOR WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
IT'S A REACTION AGAINST HAVING FORMAL DINNER PARTIES AND ALMOST ALL THESE FACTORIES ARE GIVING DINNER SERVICES 
AND TUREENS AND PLATES AND DECORATIVE WARES 
OF COURSE MINIMALIST TODAY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THEM 
SO THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO EMPLOY THESE WONDERFUL BRITISH ARTISTS ANY MORE 
BUT THIS OF COURSE WAS MADE IN A DIFFERENT GENERATION A DIFFERENT ERA 
IT WAS MADE BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY AND NINETEEN HUNDRED 
IT'S PART OF THE DOULTON FAIENCE WARES 
DO YOU KNOW MUCH ABOUT THEM 
NO NOT REALLY ONLY THAT IT'S HAND PAINTED AND A LOVELY SHAPE 
HAND PAINTED HAND DESIGNED AND THEY TOOK THEIR INSPIRATION FROM THE ITALIAN FAIENCE 
AND MAJOLICA WARES THE FRENCH PHIALS AND ITALIAN MAJOLICA WARES FROM HUNDREDS OF YEARS EARLIER 
YOU TURN IT OVER AND 
THERE WE ARE NICE IMPRESSED MARK THERE DOULTON LAMBETH 
WE'VE GOT THE INITIALS THERE J. D. HAVE YOU DONE YOUR RESEARCH 
JOSEPHINE DURNTNALL WELL DONE 
BRILLIANT SHE WAS AN ARTIST WHO WAS WORKING AT DOULTON FOR A FAIR PERIOD 
SHE WASN'T ONE OF THE MOST PROLIFIC OF ARTISTS BUT THERE ARE RECORDED PIECES BY HER 
SO WHAT'S IT WORTH WHAT YOU THINK 
I WAS JUST PUTTING A FIGURE OF ONE HUNDRED ON IT 
I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN ESTIMATE OF ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ON IT 
I THINK IT SHOULD GO MID ESTIMATE IN THAT 
THE DOULTON MARKET'S FAIRLY BUOYANT 
AGAIN IT'S JUST SEEN THIS SURGE OF INTEREST 
NOW THEY'VE MOVED EVERYTHING ABROAD PEOPLE ARE SAYING 
OF COURSE THERE'S A LIMIT NOW TO THE NUMBER OF PIECES MADE IN THE U. K. 
SO WHEN BESWICK CLOSED IN THE U. K. THE BESWICK PRICE WENT UP 
I THINK THE SAME THING'LL HAPPEN TO DOULTON 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE RIGHT TO SELL IT YOU MIGHT HAVE JUST LET IT GO A BIT TOO SOON 
WE'VE GOT TOO MUCH CLUTTER ANYWAY 
WE HAVE GOT TO DECLUTTER 
IT'S GOT TO GO REALLY 
O. K. WELL LET'S WHIP IT OFF TO THE AUCTION AND SEE HOW WE DO 
GOOD 
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU JODIE 
HAD FLOG IT NOT BEEN HERE WHERE WOULD THIS PICTURE HAVE ENDED UP IN THE SKIP THE SKIP YES 
WHY ON EARTH IN THE SKIP 
WELL WE'RE ABOUT TO MOVE HOUSE AND WE KEEP ON MOVING IT FROM ONE HOUSE 
TO ANOTHER AND IT JUST STAYS IN THE LOFT AND I DON'T LIKE IT 
YOU DON'T LIKE IT IS IT TOO DARK AND GLOOMY FOR YOU 
YES VERY MUCH SO THE SUBJECT MATTER IS NOT PARTICULARLY PLEASANT 
BUT HAVE YOU KNOWN IT A LONG TIME OR IS IT SOMETHING YOU'VE ONLY KNOWN FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS 
IT'S BEEN IN THE FAMILY FOR A LONG TIME AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER 
APPARENTLY I REALLY LIKED IT WHEN I WAS VERY VERY SMALL 
RIGHT DRAWN BY THE SUBJECT ANIMALS BIRDS I WOULD IMAGINE SO YES 
I'VE HAD A LITTLE LOOK AT THIS AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE FAMILY HAVE EVER KNOWN THE ARTIST 
NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE I'M STRUGGLING TO READ THE SIGNATURE 
I CAN SEE IT'S ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN IN DATE 
IT'S AN OIL PAINTING ON CANVAS AND IT'S A STILL LIFE IN EFFECT 
OF A HUNTING HOUND STANDING VERY PATIENTLY LOOKING VERY LEAN 
ITS RIBS ARE SHOWING A LITTLE LANGUISHLY THERE STANDING BESIDE THE TREE 
HIS MASTER'S GUN IS PROPPED THERE AND SO IS THE SPOILS OF THE DAY 
BRACE OF PHEASANT DUCKS ETC 
IT LEADS OFF INTO QUITE AN INTRICATE WOODED SCENE AT THE BACK 
BUT BECAUSE IT'S SO OLD AND DIRTY I THINK A LOT OF THE DETAIL IS LOST TO VISION THERE 
BUT I LIKE IT IT REALLY STEMS FROM THE ENGLISH NAIVE SCHOOL OF THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY WHEN 
HUNTING AND COUNTRY SPORTS WERE VERY POPULAR 
OF COURSE NOW IT'S NOT SO P. C. BUT AS AN IMAGE IT'S STILL VERY COMMERCIAL 
IT'S STILL VERY POPULAR 
I ALSO LIKE THE FACT IT'S NOT SUCH A LARGE PICTURE 
IT'S QUITE A CONTAINABLE SIZE PICTURE WITH A LOT OF DETAIL IN IT 
NOW YOU OBVIOUSLY DECIDED NOT TO PUT IT IN THE SKIP BUT YOU'D LIKE TO SELL IT YES DEFINITELY 
IT'S RATHER SPECULATIVE I THINK IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT FOR ANYONE TO ATTRIBUTE IT TO A SPECIFIC ARTIST 
BUT I THINK OF ITS GENRE OF ITS AGE AND ITS COMPETENCY IN PAINTING 
YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING AT ROUNDABOUT SEVENTY TO ONE HUNDRED FOR IT WHICH WOULD PLEASE YOU 
YES DEFINITELY 
IF WE AGREED A RESERVE OF SEVENTY WOULD YOU BE HAPPY WITH THAT NO PROBLEM AT ALL YES 
WE'LL PUT THAT THROUGH THE AUCTION HAPPY ENDING ALL BEING WELL LOVELY 
WELL THINGS ARE MOVING ALONG SMOOTHLY HERE IN CAMBRIDGE 
AS WE KNOW IT'S A VERY ANCIENT CITY DATING BACK TO THE ELEVENTH CENTURY 
BUT WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS SOMETHING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AND THEY BELONG 
TO A BROTHER AND SISTER PARTNERSHIP TOM AND CHLOE SO WHAT IS IT TOM WHAT ARE WE PLAYING WITH 
THESE ARE NINTENDO TABLE TOP GAMES WE GOT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE FOR CHRISTMAS SO 
BEFORE I WAS TEN AND MY SISTER WAS ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLD 
GOT MARIO I STILL AROUND 
CHLOE'S GOT SNOOPY HERE IN BRIGHT ORANGE 
THAT A NICE GIRLY ONE ISN'T IT YES 
WE TAKE IT IN TURNS TO SEE WHO'S GOT THE HIGHEST SCORE 
HAVE YOU BEATEN HIM YET NO I HAVEN'T NEVER 
NO HE ALWAYS WINS 
WELL I SUGGEST IF YOU WANT TO SELL THESE PUT THEM INTO A SPECIALIST 
TWENTIETH CENTURY DESIGN AUCTION BECAUSE THEY ARE DESIGN CLASSICS 
ESPECIALLY WITH THOSE BRIGHT VIVID COLOURS SOMETHING LIKE THAT'S WORTH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EACH 
GOOD INVESTMENT IT IS YEAH 
THAT'S WHERE ANTIQUES ARE GOING RIGHT NOW TWENTIETH CENTURY IS THE THING TO COLLECT 
GOOD LUCK YOU TWO THANK YOU 
CAMBRIDGE IS DEFINITELY THE CITY WHERE THE OLD MEETS THE NEW 
NOW SHARON YOU'VE BROUGHT ALONG AN AUTOGRAPH BOOK 
IS THIS SOMETHING YOU COLLECTED AS A LITTLE GIRL 
NO IT BELONGS TO MY MOTHER 
LOTS OF BLANK PAGES SHE WASN'T KEEN WAS SHE 
NO SHE DIDN'T FILL MUCH OF IT DID SHE 
WHAT'S THAT ONE 
STAN GRAY HAROLD ALF 
THAT MIGHT BE THE SMITHS 
OH THE SMITH BROTHERS O. K. 
I DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE DO YOU 
NO MY DAD DOES BUT I DON'T 
I HAVE TO SAY IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN AUTOGRAPH IN AN AUTOGRAPH BOOK THOSE TWO 
AREN'T BAD ONES TO HAVE ARE THEY 
NO THEY'RE GOOD ONES 
SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN KEEN BUT SHE DID DO HER JOB WELL 
LAUREL AND HARDY ONE OF THE BEST AUTOGRAPHS YOU COULD FIND IN AN AUTOGRAPH BOOK 
AND THEY'RE NICE AND CLEAN THE BOOK HASN'T BEEN THUMBED 
I'D BETTER STOP DOING IT 
BUT IT SAYS AT THE TOP HELLO FAY 
WHO WAS FAY THAT IS MY MUM AND DID SHE QUEUE UP AND GET THIS HERSELF 
NO SHE DIDN'T HER FATHER GOT IT FOR HER OH WONDERFUL 
AND WAS HE A GREAT THEATREGOER 
NO HE RAN A BUS COMPANY AND I WOULDN'T KNOW WHETHER HE HADN'T I DON'T KNOW THAT PART OF IT 
HE GOT IT FROM A LOCAL THEATRE WHERE THEY LIVED 
CAN'T IMAGINE LAUREL AND HARDY GETTING ON THE LOCAL BUS 
AND WHEN DID HE GET THEM ABOUT THE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
THEY CAME OVER TO ENGLAND AND HAD A LITTLE TOUR THEN BRILLIANT 
LAUREL AND HARDY ARE IN THE TOP FIVE OR SIX OF THE AUTOGRAPH HUNTERS' 
REQUESTS REALLY 
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD PAGE 
THE ONLY SLIGHT DISADVANTAGE IS THAT IT SAYS HELLO FAY AT THE TOP 
IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT COULD BE TRIMMED AND THESE AUTOGRAPHS AND DEALERS DO TRIM AUTOGRAPHS UP 
BUT I WOULD LEAVE THAT 
I THINK HELLO FAY IS QUITE A NICE THING TO HAVE 
AT THE TOP VALUE O. K. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH 
MY SON AND MY MUM SAW YOU SELL ONE RECENTLY ON FLOG IT AND IT WAS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED 
ABSOLUTELY THAT ONE WASN'T PERSONALISED AT THE TOP 
THAT WAS PART OF A BIG COLLECTION OF STUFF AND IT WAS SPLIT UP 
I'M A GREAT SENTIMENTALIST 
I LIKE TO KEEP COLLECTIONS TOGETHER 
BUT IT WAS SPLIT UP AND IT SOLD VERY WELL 
SO IS YOUR SON A FLOG IT FAN 
YES VERY MUCH AND IS THIS HIS 
IT'S HIS BUT HE HAS TO SHARE THE PROCEEDS WITH MY NIECE 
I THINK WE OUGHT TO HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED ON IT SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT WE DO NEED TO PROTECT IT WITH A RESERVE 
IT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT IF THE RIGHT PEOPLE AREN'T THERE IT MIGHT GO TOO CHEAPLY 
SO LET'S PROTECT IT WITH MAYBE TWO HUNDRED AS A FIRM RESERVE 
AND IF IT DOESN'T MAKE THAT THEN WE CAN TAKE IT AWAY AND PUT IT IN THE SALE ANOTHER TIME 
LOVELY THANK YOU SUPER LET'S GO FOR IT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
THIS IS JUST SUCH A SUMPTUOUS SAMPLER 
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT IN NOW IT WAS WORKED I SEE HERE BY JANE KING 
AGED TEN IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY ONE IS IT A FAMILY PIECE OF YOURS MAGGIE YES IT IS 
CAN YOU TELL ME THE HISTORY OF IT 
WELL AS FAR AS I KNOW IT WAS FROM MY MOTHER'S SIDE OF THE FAMILY 
MY AUNT HAD IT IN HER POSSESSION FOR YEARS AND THEN ONE DAY DECIDED THAT MOTHER COULD HAVE IT 
ONE DAY MUM DECIDED THAT SHE WOULD LIKE IT FRAMED AND THAT'S HOW IT GOT THIS FRAME 
I THINK IT WAS DONE POSSIBLY FORTY 
YEARS AGO IN THE SIXTIES MAYBE EVEN BEFORE THAT PROBABLY FIFTIES 
AND THEN IT'S COME TO YOU YOU INHERITED THAT YES WHEN MY MOTHER DIED 
AND YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY TREASURED IT AND LOOKED AFTER IT BECAUSE 
I HAVE I'VE BEEN AFRAID TO HANG IT REALLY BECAUSE THEY DO FADE 
THEY DO INDEED THAT'S REMARKABLE THAT THE COLOURS ARE QUITE STRONG ON THIS STILL 
THEY ARE AND I'VE KEPT IT IN A CUPBOARD OVER THE 
LAST FEW YEARS BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID THAT IT MIGHT GO BEYOND RECOGNITION 
IT'S QUITE A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE CUSTODIAN OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
KNOWING THAT YOU WANT TO SEE IT LIVE A BIT LONGER DO YOU LIKE IT GRAHAM 
I DO INDEED 
IN A SENSE IT CAME AS A DOWRY 
I THOUGHT THAT THINGS I HAD WERE OF VALUE BUT AS IT TURNED 
QUITE RIGHT TOO 
IT'S A CHARMING PIECE OF EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY WORK 
BY A CHILD A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL AND SHE HAS ACHIEVED MARVELLOUS WORK 
IT'S A SAMPLER WORKED IN CROSS STITCH IN COLOURED SILKS ON NOT THE FINEST 
OF GROUNDS BUT A FAIRLY FINE BACKDROP THERE WHICH SHE'S USED VERY WELL 
INDICATIVE OF THE PERIOD IS THIS DISTINCTIVE HONEYSUCKLE BORDER 
WHAT IS UNUSUAL IS THAT SHE HAS FEW WORDS AND A LOT OF PICTURE 
AND ANYTHING THAT BEARS BUILDINGS OR ARCHITECTURAL FORM TENDS TO BE RATHER UNUSUAL 
AND THE BIGGER AND MORE UNUSUAL THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING THE BETTER 
I LIKE THE GARDEN WITH THE RAILINGS AROUND IT REALLY IS RATHER SUMPTUOUS 
AND ALTHOUGH IT'S HAD A SAD HISTORY TO THE EXTENT IT'S BEEN 
SHUT AWAY FOR A LOT OF ITS LIFE AS WE VIEW IT TODAY THAT'S AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE IT'S SURVIVED SO VERY WELL 
SO IT'S A CATCH TWENTY TWO SITUATION 
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA OF THE LIKELY VALUE IN THIS CURRENT MARKET FOR IT 
I WOULD HOPE IT WOULD BE IN THE HUNDREDS ITS CONDITION IS GOOD IT'S QUITE A RARE EXAMPLE 
I THINK WE NEED TO SET A RESERVE WHICH IS REALISTIC AND FAIR TO YOURSELF 
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IN THE REGION OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY AS THE RESERVE WOULD BE SUITABLE 
BUT POSSIBLY SUGGEST THAT THE ESTIMATE EXTENDS 
TO ROUND ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY SO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY TO FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY AS A SPAN OF GUIDE 
WOULD THAT SUIT YOU IT WOULD YES 
IT'S TIME FOR IT TO GO I THINK 
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT IN IT'S A PLEASURE 
SAMPLERS ARE USUALLY POPULAR SO LET'S SEE IF THE BIDDERS AGREE WITH ELIZABETH'S VALUATION 
ALSO GOING OFF TO THE SALE IS SHEILA'S DOULTON VASE 
AND THE OIL PAINTING THAT'S BEEN HIDDEN IN JODIE'S ATTIC 
LET'S HOPE THE AUTOGRAPH BOOK SIGNED BY LAUREL AND HARDY DOESN'T GET JAMES INTO ANOTHER FINE MESS 
AUCTIONEER WILL AXON IS THE MAN WITH THE GAVEL AND IT'S HIS JOB 
TO SELL OUR ITEMS HERE AT CHEFFINS SALE ROOM IN CAMBRIDGE 
BEFORE THE ACTION STARTS LET'S CATCH UP WITH HIM AND SEE WHAT HE THINKS OF SOME OF OUR OWNERS' ITEMS 
SHARON'S AUTOGRAPH BOOK 
OUR EXPERT JAMES IS A VERY BRAVE MAN TO VALUE THIS 
THEY'RE HARD TO VALUE IN THE FIRST PLACE 
BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT IN THERE YOU FLICK THROUGH THAT AND HAVE A LOOK WE'VE GOT LAUREL AND HARDY 
YOU LIKE TO SEE THESE AUTOGRAPH ALBUMS JAM PACKED FULL OF AUTOGRAPHS SIGNATURES 
YOU WORK YOUR WAY THROUGH YOU START TRYING TO RECOGNISE CERTAIN NAMES THERE 
HE'S A BRAVE MAN TO PUT TWO TO THREE ON THAT 
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY IN THIN AIR 
BUT INVISIBLE INK PERHAPS 
THERE WE GET ONE ROGER PATRICK I DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS

FIVE SMITH BROTHERS FIVE BROTHERS CALLED SMITH THERE YOU GO STAN GRAY HAROLD ALF AND RONNIE 
THERE'S THE STAN AND OLIVER WHICH IS FINE 
NICE LITTLE DEDICATION THERE HELLO FAY WHICH CORRESPONDS WITH THE NAME IN THE FRONT 
THAT'S NICE A NICE SORT OF TIE UP 
O. K. THE BAD NEWS IS THERE'S A FIXED RESERVE OF TWO HUNDRED ON THIS 
I THINK IT'S GOING TO STRUGGLE I MEAN I'VE SEEN LAUREL AND HARDY I HAVE VALUED THEM IN THE PAST 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YOU SAY YOU GOT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOR ONE MAYBE ON A PHOTOGRAPH NICE AND EASY TO DISPLAY 
YOU JUST PUT IT IN A FRAME 
THAT'S NOT SO GOOD PEN INK BIRO 
IT FADES 
EXACTLY IN THE CORNER OF THE AUTOGRAPH BOOK NOT IN THE MIDDLE 
BANG IN THE MIDDLE 
I THINK THAT'LL STRUGGLE AT TWO HUNDRED 
I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY VALUED THAT AT EIGHTY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THE OLD CLICHE 
BUT YOU KNOW IT SHOULD BE WORTH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED QUID FOR THE AUTOGRAPHS 
FINGERS CROSSED ON THIS ONE

AND THEN HANG ON TO THAT 
YES 
PUNTING DOWN THE RIVER CAM IS PART OF LIFE HERE IN CAMBRIDGE 
IN THE SUMMER IT'S FULL OF STUDENTS AND FAMILIES MAKING THE MOST OF THIS TRADITIONAL PASTIME 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY JAM PACKED OUT THERE 
PUNTS WERE INTRODUCED TO THE RIVER CAM AS PLEASURE BOATS 
IN EDWARDIAN TIMES AND QUICKLY BECAME THE CITY'S FAVOURITE PASTIME 
ONE OF THE EARLY PIONEERS OF PUNT HIRE ON THE RIVER WAS A MR. SCUDAMORE WHO FOUNDED HIS BUSINESS IN NINETEEN TEN 
WITH ME TODAY IS A MEMBER OF THE COMPANY AND HIS NAME'S PETE KEOGH 
AND HE'S AT THE HELM CHAUFFEURING ME ALONG 
THANKS FOR HELPING US OUT ON SUCH A DAMP DAY MY PLEASURE 
DID MR. SCUDAMORE START OUT BUILDING PUNTS YES HE DID 
THEY ARE TRADITIONALLY MADE OUT OF A HARDWOOD CALLED IROKO 
THEY'VE BEEN AROUND SINCE SEVEN HUNDRED AD WHERE THEY WERE USED IN THE FENLANDS 
OUTSIDE OF CAMBRIDGE FOR TRADING AND ALSO FOR DUCK SHOOTING 
WHY DID THEY BECOME SO POPULAR WITH THE STUDENTS HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY 
YOU HAVE ONE OF THE MOST IDYLLIC PIECES OF RIVER IN ENGLAND 
AND WITH THE STUDENTS IT'S ROMANTIC 
ROMANTIC EXACTLY HAVE YOU FALLEN IN MANY TIMES YES I HAVE 
THREE TIMES IN EIGHT YEARS 
THAT'S NOT BAD GOING IT'S QUITE A GOOD RECORD 
WHAT COLLEGE IS THIS 
THIS COLLEGE IS KING'S COLLEGE IT DATES TO ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY ONE IT WAS FOUNDED BY KING HENRY THE SIXTH 
THE CHAPEL ITSELF TOOK ALMOST NINETY YEARS TO BUILD AND WAS FINISHED UNDER THE REIGN OF HENRY THE EIGHTH 
JUST IN THE CENTRE THERE YOU HAVE THE GIBBS' BUILDING ALSO KNOWN AS THE FELLOWS' BUILDING 
TO THE RIGHT YOU HAVE STUDENT ACCOMMODATION THE BODLEY BUILDING 
WE PASS UNDER SOME STUNNING BRIDGES TELL ME ABOUT THE MATHEMATICAL BRIDGE 
THE MATHEMATICAL BRIDGE WAS BUILT IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY NINE BY WILLIAM ETHERIDGE 
ORIGINALLY BASED ON A CHINESE BRIDGE CALLED THE RAINBOW BRIDGE 
IT'S ACTUALLY BUILT USING THE THEORY OF A TANGENT WITHIN A CIRCLE ALL THE PIECES OF WOOD INTERLOCK 
CRIKEY IT'S A SELF STANDING STRUCTURE 
TECHNICALLY IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY NEED ANY NUTS AND BOLTS TO HOLD IT UP 
CONTRARY TO STRONG BELIEF SIR ISAAC NEWTON HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT 
WE'RE COMING UP TO ANOTHER BRIDGE WHICH ONE IS THIS THIS IS TRINITY BRIDGE 
SO THIS IS TRINITY COLLEGE I'M LOOKING AT NOW TRINITY COLLEGE YES 
THIS COLLEGE WAS BUILT IN THE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FORTIES IT WAS FOUNDED BY HENRY THE EIGHTH 
IT'S THE RICHEST AND LARGEST COLLEGE WE HAVE IN CAMBRIDGE 
IT HAS ASSETS VALUED AT ALMOST TWO BILLION GOSH 
IT OWNS FELIXSTOWE DOCKS TEN PER CENT OF MANHATTAN ISLAND AND IT'S SAID THAT UP TO ALMOST FIVE YEARS AGO 
YOU COULD WALK BETWEEN CAMBRIDGE AND OXFORD ON TRINITY OWNED LAND 
YOU HAVE TO WATCH YOUR HEAD THERE CRIKEY 
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE 
AS LONG AS I DON'T GET MY POLE STUCK IT'S FINE YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR POLE STUCK IN THE MUD 
YES I HAVE IT'S RATHER EMBARRASSING WHEN YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF CUSTOMERS ON THE BOAT 
AND YOU'RE KNEELING USING YOUR HANDS TO PADDLE BACK TO IT IT'S EMBARRASSING 
THIS IS ACTUALLY THE BRIDGE OF SIGHS IT'S BASED ON THE ONE IN VENICE 
THE ONE IN VENICE GOES FROM THE DOGE'S PALACE TO THE COURT HOUSE 
WHEN THE PRISONERS WERE CONVICTED THEY WERE SENT OVER THE BRIDGE BUT NOT ALLOWED TO TALK 
THEY COULD ONLY SIGH AT THEIR LAST VIEW OF FREEDOM 
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'VE GOT ONE HERE IS IT'S ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS 
AND ALSO IT GOES BETWEEN THE HALLS OF RESIDENCE AND EXAM ROOMS 
THEY WOULD WALK ACROSS AND SIGH JUST BEFORE ENTERING THEIR EXAMS 
THERE IS ONE IN OXFORD THAT GOES OVER A ROAD 
THE REASON WHY THEY'VE GOT ONE IN OXFORD IS BECAUSE 
THE STUDENTS THERE WOULD LOOK OVER THE VIEW OF THEIR CITY 
AND WISH THEY'D HAD THE ACADEMIC PROWESS TO GET INTO THIS ONE 
OH 
THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO SEE THE UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS ISN'T IT 
DEFINITELY YOU HAVE THE SEVEN MOST FAMOUS COLLEGES ON THE RIVER 
WHEN YOU'RE PUNTING DOWN DURING THE SUMMER IT'S A LOT OF FUN 
THERE'S LOTS OF BOATS ON THE RIVER 
NO WONDER PEOPLE COME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO SEE THIS INSPIRING VIEW 
BACK ON DRY LAND THANKS PETE THANKS VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOUR HELP MY PLEASURE 
AT LEAST I ESCAPED A DUNKING THERE DIDN'T I 
IT JUST GOES TO PROVE YOU CAN HAVE FUN ON THE RIVER ALL YEAR ROUND NO MATTER WHAT THE WEATHER 
THINGS ARE MUCH BRIGHTER BACK AT THE VALUATION DAY 
WHERE JAMES AND ELIZABETH ARE STILL VERY MUCH HARD AT WORK 
THIS IS A VERY EXCITING POT 
DOES IT BELONG TO HOWARD OR GEORGE WHOSE IS IT 
IT'S A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY'S HE CAN'T COME TODAY BECAUSE HE'S AT CHURCH 
HE INHERITED IT FROM HIS WIFE IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES FROM HER MOTHER IT GOES BACK TO THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
RIGHT AND STAYED IN THE SAME FAMILY ALL THAT TIME 
YES 
IT'S A PIECE OF CARLTON WARE 
WHICH IN ITSELF IS A GOOD NAME FOR ENGLISH CERAMICS 
THEY WERE HIGH UP IN THE ECHELONS OF DESIGNER ART POTTERY FROM THE EARLY PART OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
IT'S GOT A NICE FACTORY MARK ON THE BOTTOM TOGETHER WITH THE SHAPE NUMBER WHICH IS IMPRESSED 
IS IT SOMETHING YOUR FRIEND LIKES OR 
I DON'T THINK HE'S GOT ANY FEELING AT ALL 
IT WAS HIDDEN AWAY IN A CUPBOARD IN A CUPBOARD 
IT'S BEEN LOVED OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE THE CONDITION IS VERY GOOD 
THE COLOURS IN THE DESIGN SUIT IT BEAUTIFULLY 
IT'S VERY VIBRANT AND STRONG 
YOU SAY THE DESIGN WAS CALLED PAPYRUS PAPYRUS 
YOU CAN SEE THE INFLUENCE 
THEY'VE TAKEN IT TO THE EXTREME OF DESIGN USING THAT AS ITS INFLUENCE 
IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY IT SUITS THE SHAPE OF THE VASE TOO 
CARLTON WARE TENDS TO BE FAIRLY HARD WEARING WHEN IT COMES TO THE MORE EARTHENWARE PIECES THEY DID 
CARLTON WARE MADE A LOT OF VARIATION OF PRODUCT RIGHT THROUGH FROM TEA WARES TO ART POTTERY 
CARLTON WARE IS VERY COLLECTIBLE AND PRICES ARE FAIRLY BUOYANT AT THE MOMENT 
ALTHOUGH SOME THINGS ARE ALWAYS MORE SOUGHT AFTER THAN OTHERS 
THIS FALLS INTO THE CATEGORY OF ART POTTERY WHICH AT THE MOMENT IS VERY COLLECTIBLE 
HAS YOUR FRIEND GOT PRECONCEIVED IDEAS OF WHAT HE THINKS IT'S WORTH 
ONLY WHAT I TOLD HIM ACTUALLY I GAVE HIM A ROUGH IDEA 
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED HE WAS QUITE HAPPY WITH THAT 
THAT'S GOOD THEN 
I HAVE TO SAY I THINK I CONCUR WITH YOU ON THAT IT SHOULD MAKE 
BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED IF THE MARKET ON THE DAY IS GOOD FOR ART POTTERY 
CERTAINLY FOR TWO HUNDRED YOU GET A DECENT SIZED PIECE OF CARLTON WARE 
IT SEEMS A GOOD PRICE 
WE'LL TAKE IT TO AUCTION AND PUT A RESERVE ON OF TWO HUNDRED FOR YOUR FRIEND HE'D BE HAPPY YES 
I THINK WE SHOULD SEE A SALE AT TWO HUNDRED THAT SHOULD BE FINE 
O. K. HE'LL BE VERY PLEASED WITH THAT GOOD 
PRISCILLA KATHLEEN THIS REALLY IS WORTH WAITING FOR 
IT'S A LOVELY THING 
THE FRONT COVER HERE IS TOOLED IN LEATHER AND THEN PAINTED 
HAND PAINTED AND GILDED WITH A GENTLEMAN WITH A BUNCH OF FLOWERS 
YOU'D EXPECT A GIRL ON THE OTHER SIDE THE SORT OF THING YOU'D SEE IN A NINETEENTH CENTURY CRYSTOLEUM 
BUT WHEN WE OPEN IT UP IT BECOMES FAR FAR MORE INTERESTING 
JUST LOOK AT THAT 
YES IT'S THE SORT OF PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM THAT A WELL TO DO GENTLEMAN 
WOULD HAVE COLLECTED ON THE GRAND TOUR 
TO LEARN ALL ABOUT THE WORLD 
HE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN SOME OF THESE PHOTOGRAPHS 
OTHERS ARE FROM PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHERS WE GO THROUGH HERE 
AND OH 
SUPER BARCELONA 
ALHAMBRA THEY'RE SOME OF MY FAVOURITES AREN'T THEY WONDERFUL 
SO WE TRAVEL THROUGH WHERE DID HE GO EUROPE AFRICA TANGIERS 
NORTH AFRICA 
OH I SAY 
AND OF COURSE WHEN THESE GENTLEMEN WENT ON THE GRAND TOUR 
THEY WOULD BE AWAY FOR A LONG TIME AND NEED TO FIND COMFORT IN THE ARMS OF ANOTHER 
AND HERE SHE IS SHOWING A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH 
NOT LEAVING MUCH TO THE IMAGINATION 
IT SAYS THERE A LADY OF THE BEDROOM 
MOVING THROUGH IT'S STRANGE REALLY BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT SOME OF THESE RELIGIOUS SCENES MIXED IN 
WONDERFUL THEY'RE SO CLEAR THE PHOTOGRAPHS WONDERFUL QUALITY YES 
THE PAPER'S SO SORT OF IT'S NOT MARKED NO 
I THINK THEY'RE PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHS AND THERE 
PROBABLY THE SHIP THAT HE ARRIVED ON 
THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE TOWARDS THE END WHAT'S THAT 
BERBOUSCI FRERES OF TUNIS WONDERFUL 
AND THE THINGS HE'S SELLING MASSES OF THINGS 
EARLY FLAT PACK FURNITURE WE THINK THAT'S A THING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY BUT IT'S NOT NO 
WITH THESE THINGS THE TOP COMES OFF AND THEY FOLD DOWN 
SO TOURISTS CAN TAKE THEM HOME 
CONSIDERING THE AGE OF THE PHOTOS 
YOU CAN SEE SUCH A LOT IN THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE A NICE BIG SIZE 
TELL ME HOW DID YOU COME TO HAVE IT IN THE FAMILY 
WELL IT WAS AMONGST MY FATHER'S EFFECTS 
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HE BOUGHT IT IN A SECOND HAND BOOKSHOP AH 
O. K. BECAUSE HE USED TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN SECOND HAND BOOKSHOPS 
HE WAS ALSO VERY INTERESTED IN PHOTOGRAPHS AND POSTCARDS 
SO YOUR GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER DIDN'T GO ON THE GRAND TOUR 
NO UNFORTUNATELY NOT UNFORTUNATELY NOT 
THE PHOTOGRAPHS ARE NOT PERSONAL FAMILY PICTURES 
MIND YOU IF THEY WERE YOU WOULDN'T BE SELLING IT EXACTLY EXACTLY YES 
I REALLY LIKE IT AND I ALWAYS OVERVALUE THINGS I REALLY LIKE SO I'VE GOT TO TAKE A STEP BACK 
WHAT SHALL WE SAY 
I T. H. I. N. K. ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
RIGHT M. M. M. O. K. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED 
IF IT MADE TOWARDS THE TWO HUNDRED MARK ONE REALLY LIKE IT IT'S WONDERFUL 
GOOD IT'S MY FAVOURITE THING TODAY OH GOOD THAT'S LOVELY 
IF I WAS ALLOWED TO I'D BID ON THAT I REALLY LOVE IT WONDERFUL 
EMMA DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE BROUGHT TODAY WELL 
I BELIEVE THEY'RE MOORCROFT BUT I'M NOT REALLY SURE ABOUT THEM 
WE'VE JUST HAD THEM HANGING AROUND FOR A WHILE 
AND I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THEY WERE THEY ARE INDEED MOORCROFT 
THEY ARE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY WILLIAM MOORCROFT 
HIS SIGNATURE IS ON THE BASE WELL DISPLAYED THERE OH YES 
THE MOORCROFT FACTORY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR A CENTURY OR SO NOW 
WILLIAM WAS THE LEADING FOUNDER 
AND HIS SON WALTER TOOK OVER DURING THE MID TWENTIETH CENTURY OH RIGHT 
HIS WORKS ARE NOW HIGHLY PRIZED 
IT WAS A VERY DISTINCTIVE STYLE OF MANUFACTURE OF THE POTTERY 
WITH TUBE LINED DECORATION WHICH IS ALMOST PIPED ICING WHICH GIVES THE OUTLINE OF THE DESIGN 
THAT'S INFILLED WITH A WASH OF COLOUR WHICH IS THEN FIRED TO THESE WONDERFUL COLOURS 
IT'S QUITE BOLD IT IS BOLD DO YOU LIKE IT 
YES IT'S DARKER THAN I'D NORMALLY GO FOR BUT IT'S STRIKING 
THIS ONE IS CALLED THE LEAF AND BERRIES PATTERN 
ON THE SCALE OF ZERO TO TEN FOR RARITY IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT TWO I SHOULD THINK 
UM BUT IS THE OBJECTS THEMSELVES WHICH I QUITE LIKE 
NOW THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE JUG AND BOWL FROM A TEA SERVICE 
BUT THEY'RE NOT THE SORT OF THING WHICH COMES ONTO THE MARKET VERY OFTEN I LIKE THE JUG 
I THINK IT'S CUTE ISN'T IT IT IS 
NOW YOU'VE HAD THEM IN THE FAMILY FOR A WHILE WE'VE HAD THEM FOR TWENTY YEARS OR SO 
I THINK MY GREAT AUNT HAD THEM BEFORE THAT 
BUT I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHERE SHE GOT THEM FROM 
THE CONDITION IS GOOD AND THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE TRYING TO GET ONTO THE LADDER OF COLLECTING MOORCROFT 
AS THE BIGGER PIECES BECOME MORE EXPENSIVE IT BECOMES MORE EXCLUSIVE 
THAT IN TURN IS PULLING UP THE VALUE OF THESE SO IT'S A GOOD STARTING POINT ABSOLUTELY 
THE MORE AVERAGE PIECES I THINK YOU'D BE LOOKING AT BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOR THE TWO PIECES 
COOL YOU'D BE HAPPY WITH THAT THAT'S O. K. 
ASSUMING THEY SELL HAPPILY HAVE YOU GOT A PROJECT IN MIND OR SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE TO DO WITH THE MONEY 
I DON'T KNOW MAYBE JUST LOOK OUT FOR A FEW MORE PIECES AT AUCTION 
DO YOU COLLECT I'M DEVELOPING MY OWN INTEREST IN COMING TO THESE THINGS THAT'S GOOD 
WE'LL SEE HOW WE DO AT AUCTION YOU MIGHT EVEN REINVEST AT THE AUCTION INDEED 
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GIVE EMMA'S COLLECTING A BOOST BY SELLING HER MOORCROFT JUG AND BOWL 
FIND A HOME THAT'S BIG AND BOLD ENOUGH FOR THE CARLTON WARE VASE 
AND TEMPT THE BIDDERS WITH A FASCINATING COLLECTION OF PHOTOS FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD 
AH 
LOOK WHAT I FOUND HIDING AMONGST ALL THIS BROWN EDWARDIAN FURNITURE 
A GORGEOUS GEORGE THE THIRD WINGED ARMCHAIR 
JUST LOOK AT THE PROPORTION OF THIS 
IT'S STUNNING APART FROM THE BACK RAIL THERE'S NOT ONE STRAIGHT LINE ON THIS CHAIR 
JUST LOOK HOW THE SIDES SWEEP DOWN CARESSING YOU AS YOU SIT IN IT 
IT REALLY IS BEAUTIFUL 
ANOTHER VIRTUE ABOUT THIS CHAIR IS THE FRONT FEET ARE A GORGEOUS CAB LEG 
TERMINATING ON A RICH TOE 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE BACK LEG IT'S GOT A MATCHING CAB LEG AT THE BACK 
NORMALLY THESE CHAIRS HAVE A SWEPT BACK SABRE LEG 
THIS CHAIR LOOKS IRISH 
IT'S GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY EVEN IN THIS CONDITION IT'S GOING TO SET YOU BACK TWO THOUSAND IN AUCTION 
I KNOW IT LOOKS TATTY AND HORRIBLE BUT WITH THE RIGHT FINISH 
YOU TAKE THAT TO A GOOD UPHOLSTERER AND GET THE RIGHT SILKS ON IT A DAMASK OR A REGENCY STRIPE 
THEN IT'S GOING TO BE WORTH SIX THOUSAND 
THEY'RE VERY HARD TO FIND AND THEY'RE SO COMFORTABLE AS WELL
