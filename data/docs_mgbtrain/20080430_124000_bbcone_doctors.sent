I'LL WAIT FOR MY CLIENT OUTSIDE SURE 
HAVE YOU HEARD OF WHAT'S CALLED AN INTERVENTION 
NO OH BECAUSE THIS IS LIKE THAT BASICALLY YOU'RE HERE TO LISTEN 
SUSAN HAS SOME THINGS TO SAY TO YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO HEAR 
BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO 
SHE WANTS YOU TO GET SOME HELP 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HELP FOR WHAT 
WHEN DID YOU LAST HAVE A DRINK MATTY 
BUT ISN'T IT RUDE TO STAND IN SOMEONE'S WAY 
RUDENESS DOESN'T COME INTO IT 
PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY AND G. P. SAFETY ARE SACROSANCT 
NOBODY GETS PAST THIS DESK WITHOUT AUTHORISATION 
BUT WHAT IF SOMEBODY VIVIEN HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT'S GOING ON 
JUST A MOMENT PLEASE WE ARE THE FRONT LINE AND IF YOU HAVEN'T THE STRENGTH 
TO STAND YOUR GROUND YOU SHOULD GET OUT NOW WOW 
WE WILL FIGHT THEM AT THE MILL WE WILL FIGHT THEM ON THE BEACH AND WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER 
YES YES VERY AMUSING HAVE YOU SEEN ALL THE POLICE OUTSIDE 
POLICE YEAH THEY SEEM VERY INTERESTED IN THAT VAN 
EVER SINCE WE MOVED IN WITH YOUR MUM THINGS HAVE BEEN GETTING WORSE 
I KNOW YOU TWO DON'T GET ON BUT YOU'RE SNAPPING AT ME 
YOU'RE MISSING DELIVERIES YOU DON'T SEEM TO CARE IF WE EVER MANAGE TO GET OUT OF DEBT 
THEN LAST NIGHT I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO HIT ME I EXPLAINED THAT I WOULD NEVER I WAS JUST TIRED 
NO THAT'S NOT AN EXCUSE 
THREE WEEKS AGO I FOUND AN EMPTY BOTTLE UNDER THE CUSHIONS 
WHEN I SHOWED YOUR MUM SHE SAID SHE'D BEEN FINDING THEM FOR A WHILE 
DID SHE 
AND YOU BELIEVED HER 
WHY WOULD SHE LIE MATT I KNOW IT'S HARD BUT YOU HAVE TO HEAR THIS 
THEN THIS MORNING SHE FOUND ANOTHER BOTTLE 
YOU PROMISED ME MATTY YOU SAID WHEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE DEBT 
AND YOU LOSING YOUR JOB YOU PROMISED ME YOU'D NEVER DRINK AGAIN 
AND DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT I PROMISED 
YOU SAID YOU'D LEAVE ME IF I DID 
THAT'S RIGHT 
SO I WANT YOU TO TELL ME THE TRUTH OR I'LL KEEP MY PROMISE 
CAN I SPEAK OF COURSE 
I KNOW I'VE BEEN MOODY AND DIFFICULT 
I'VE BEEN STRESSED YOU KNOW THAT AND YOU KNOW HOW BAD THINGS HAVE BEEN BETWEEN ME AND MUM 
BUT SUE YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME 
I HAVEN'T HAD A DRINK IN TWO YEARS 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR MATTHEW WHITMORE IS HE HERE 
YOU KNOW I CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT INFORMATION DI MOORE WE KNOW HE'S HERE 
I'LL HANDLE THIS DON'T GIVE ME YOUR PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY RUBBISH VIVIEN 
IT'S NOT RUBBISH IT'S COURTESY NOT THAT YOU'D KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT 
I HAVEN'T GOT TIME FOR THIS HE'S WANTED IN CONNECTION WITH A SERIOUS INCIDENT 
YOU CAN'T DO THAT MOVE OUT THE WAY 
I'M SORRY OFFICER BUT IF MR. WHITMORE IS HERE THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL HE COMES OUT 
AND IF HE ISN'T HERE THEN YOU'LL STILL HAVE TO WAIT 
DO YOU REALLY THINK IF I'D STARTED DRINKING AGAIN I'D HIDE MY EMPTIES WHERE YOU COULD FIND THEM 
I'M AN ALCOHOLIC 
THERE ARE LOTS OF REASONS FOR THAT AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM 
BUT ONE OF THOSE REASONS IS GENETIC 
YOUR MUM DOESN'T DRINK 
THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE AND SHE CAN BE VERY CONVINCING I KNOW 
BUT I WAS THE ONE HOLDING HER HAIR BACK SO SHE COULD THROW UP 
I WAS THE ONE FEEDING HER BLACK COFFEE SO SHE'D BE SOBER ENOUGH TO DRIVE ME TO SCHOOL 
THE BOTTLES AREN'T MINE 
THEY'RE HERS 
HOW CAN I TRUST YOU MATTY I KNOW IT'S HARD AFTER ALL THE LIES I'VE TOLD IN THE PAST 
SUE I'M NOT LYING 
I BELIEVE YOU 
I'M SORRY I MADE YOU DOUBT ME 
SUSAN ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE YOU BELIEVE MATT ON THIS I AM 
OBSTRUCTING AN INVESTIGATION IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER 
SO IS INTIMIDATION SHE'S ONLY DOING HER JOB LET'S HOPE FOR YOUR SAKE HE DOESN'T GET AWAY 
THERE HE IS OFFICER MUM WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE MATTHEW WHITMORE THAT'S RIGHT 
IS THAT YOUR VAN PARKED OUTSIDE YES IT IS WHAT'S 
WE'VE GOT REASON TO BELIEVE IT WAS INVOLVED IN A HIT AND RUN TWO DAYS AGO IN TINSLEY ROAD 
WERE YOU DRIVING THE VAN THAT DAY HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO DRIVES IT 
MR. WHITMORE YES I WAS DRIVING IT BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO COME DOWN TO THE STATION 
OFFICER THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE THERE'S NO MISTAKE TAKE HIM TO THE CAR 
SUSAN PLEASE TRY AND STAY CALM FOR THE BABY MATT 
I'M SORRY LOVE BUT THE OFFICER WAS CERTAIN 
I HAD TO TELL HER WHERE HE WAS 
HE'S YOUR SON 
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO PROTECT HIM 
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW HOW MUCH HE CAN LIE 
AND IF HE'S BEEN DRINKING AND DRIVING 
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS FOR THE BEST 
I'M GOING TO THE STATION 
YOU DON'T BELIEVE HIM 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE ANY MORE BUT HE'S MY HUSBAND 
THERE YOU ARE RUTH NEVER A DULL DAY AT THE MILL 
I THOUGHT THE CAMPUS HAD SOME CRAZY DAYS 
THIS HASN'T BEEN A CRAZY NO MOST DAYS ARE MUCH MORE INTERESTING 
HEY HOW DID IT GO WHAT 
YOU KNOW LUNCH ON YOUR FEET OH FINE I SUPPOSE 
NO PROBLEMS 
NO I'M FINE 
YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T TRY AND DO TOO MUCH TOO SOON 
YEAH I'LL BEAR THAT IN MIND 
RIGHT WELL I'D BEST BE OFF HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON THANKS SEE YOU SOON RUTH 
YEAH BYE ER 
DOCTOR WOODSON GEORGE ER DOCTOR GEORGE 
JUST TO BE CLEAR YOU'VE WAIVED THE RIGHT TO HAVE A SOLICITOR PRESENT 
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG 
YOU DO REALISE THAT THE VICTIM IS CRITICALLY ILL DON'T YOU 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FEEL IF SHE DIES 
I KNEW IT WOULD END UP LIKE THIS ONE DAY HIM BEHIND BARS 
COME ON YOU'RE NOT HELPING HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL I'M HIS MOTHER 
THE SHAME HE'S BROUGHT ON OUR FAMILY 
NOT TO MENTION LYING TO YOU AND MAKING YOUR LIFE A MISERY 
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS THINK THE WORST OF HIM 
BECAUSE I KNOW HIM BETTER THAN YOU DO 
HE'S CONTINUING TO DENY ANY INVOLVEMENT SO HE DIDN'T DO IT 
MRS. WHITMORE I KNOW YOUR HUSBAND'S GUILTY AND THE LONGER HE DENIES IT THE WORSE IT'LL BE FOR HIM 
SEE I KNEW IT ALL ALONG 
HE RUINS EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES 
CAN YOU PLEASE SHUT UP CAN I SEE HIM 
WHAT GOOD DO YOU THINK THAT'LL DO BELIEVE ME I WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH AS MUCH AS YOU DO 
I CAN LET YOU TALK TO HIM YEAH 
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT I'M GOING TO PROCEED WITH A PROSECUTION WHETHER HE CONFESSES OR NOT 
I'LL ARRANGE FOR YOU TO SEE HIM 
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM NO HE'S MY SON 
AND I'M HIS WIFE YOU ONLY RUB EACH OTHER UP THE WRONG WAY AND WHAT GOOD IS THAT GOING TO DO 
WHAT DOES IT MATTER ANYWAY 
HE'S CLEARLY GUILTY 
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS 
I COULDN'T GET ANY MORE STRESSED IF I KNOW THE TRUTH WILL YOU COME IN WITH ME 
ISN'T THIS SOMETHING YOU SHOULD DO ON YOUR OWN 
NO YOU STARTED THIS INTERVENTION BUSINESS YOU SHOULD FINISH IT 
WHEN I WAS AT COLLEGE 
A FRIEND OF MINE WAS AN ALCOHOLIC 
WE ALL KNEW IT BUT WE COULDN'T GET HER TO ACCEPT IT 
WE EVEN HELD AN INTERVENTION FOR HER AT MY SUGGESTION AND SHE CONVINCED US ALL THAT SHE WASN'T DRINKING 
AND A WEEK LATER SHE WAS KILLED IN A CAR CRASH 
FOUR TIMES OVER THE LIMIT 
I'M NOT TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO HERE 
BUT IF YOU'RE LYING TO PROTECT SUSAN IT ISN'T WORKING 
AND AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THE ONLY WAY TO PROTECT WHAT YOU HAVE 
IS TO TELL THE TRUTH 
HOW WILL YOU BE ABLE TO BELIEVE ME 
SWEAR ON OUR BABY'S LIFE 
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME SUE 
THEN SWEAR 
I SWEAR THIS IS THE TRUTH 
I WASN'T DRINKING 
BUT I'M AN ALCOHOLIC SO IT'S NOT LIKE I DON'T WANT TO 
SO I TOOK TO CARRYING A BOTTLE AROUND WITH ME 
YOU KNOW LIKE A SMOKER CARRYING HIS LAST CIGARETTE 
I FIGURED IF I COULD LOOK AT IT AND NOT DRINK IT 
I NEVER SAW HER 
MY MOBILE WAS RINGING AND I REACHED ACROSS TO SEE WHO IT WAS 
AND THE NEXT THING I HEARD THE BUMP 
I JUST PANICKED 
BUT I COULDN'T GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD 
WHAT I'D DONE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WHEN YOU FOUND OUT 
SO I HAD A DRINK 
AND I'VE BEEN DRINKING FOR THE PAST TWO DAYS 
I'LL STOP I SWEAR I'LL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT I DID AND I'LL MAKE IT RIGHT 
I SWEAR 
WERE YOU LYING ABOUT YOUR MUM 
NO 
DON'T LEAVE ME 
HE'S READY TO MAKE A STATEMENT NOW AND HE'LL CONFESS YES 
I KNEW IT IT'S FOR THE BEST 
I KNOW I'LL SORT OUT THE PAPERWORK 
PERHAPS YOU'LL BELIEVE ME NOW 
THE BOTTLES WERE YOURS WEREN'T THEY WHAT BOTTLES THE ONES I FOUND IN THE HOUSE WEEKS AGO 
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS I DON'T DRINK MRS. WHITMORE 
MATT TOLD US THE TRUTH WHAT DOES HE KNOW ABOUT THE TRUTH 
WHEN HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ME DRINK 
THAT'S JUST THE POINT WE'VE NEVER SEEN YOU DRINK EVER 
THERE YOU ARE THEN WHEN THEY RELEASE MATT TODAY WE'LL GO AND STAY IN A HOTEL 
AND THEN ONCE WE GET THROUGH THIS WE'LL FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO LIVE 
AND START UP THE BUSINESS AGAIN ON OUR OWN 
SUSAN LOVE YOU CAN'T BELIEVE A WORD HE SAYS 
GET OUT OF MY SIGHT 
IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT MOST DAYS AREN'T THIS EVENTFUL 
NEVER MIND ANYTHING ELSE THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH DRAMA BEHIND THIS DESK DRAMA I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
THE BATTLE OF WILLS VIVIEN 
THE YOUNG HEROINE VERSUS THE SCARY MONSTER 
IT'S NOT BEEN LIKE THAT AT ALL HONESTLY I'VE LEARNT SO MUCH 
NOT JUST ABOUT THE JOB BUT 
ABOUT ME I'VE NEVER STOOD UP TO ANYONE IN MY LIFE BEFORE TODAY 
YOU'VE STILL GOT A LONG WAY TO GO YOUNG LADY AND REMEMBER WHAT I SAID 
DON'T TAKE ANY NONSENSE FROM PATIENTS OR STAFF ESPECIALLY STAFF 
SEE YA BYE 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK VIVIEN 
WILL RUTH BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE CAMPUS WELL IT'S BEEN HARD WORK 
BUT IN TIME SHE'LL APPRECIATE THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE ROLE 
COME ON YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT SAY SOMETHING NICE SHE'S GOT POTENTIAL 
SORRY JULIA 
WHAT FO 
NO NO NO 
THAT IS VERY HIGH PRAISE INDEED COMING FROM VIVIEN VERY HIGH 
THEY SAY THE WOMAN MATT HIT IS GOING TO PULL THROUGH 
OH THANK HEAVENS THAT'S WONDERFUL NEWS 
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN BUT HE STILL HAS TO FACE THE CHARGES 
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT 
I'M NOT GOING TO LOSE EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS TO ME 
MATTHEW DON'T SPEAK TO ME I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN 
BUT MATT 
NONE OF IT'S TRUE YOU KNOW WHATEVER HE SAID ABOUT ME IT'S ALL LIES 
MRS. WHITMORE YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF TO ME I WANT TO 
YOU SEE IF THERE'S ONE THING I'VE LEARNT TODAY IT'S JUST HOW POWERFUL DENIAL CAN BE DON'T YOU THINK 
I'M SORRY BUT I THINK THAT'S NONSENSE 
YES I'M SURE YOU PROBABLY DO 
GOOD LUCK WITH EVERYTHING 
OH DON'T WORRY I'LL BE FINE 
WHEN YOU REACH FIFTY THINGS START TO GO WRONG 
WE'RE HERE TO SEE DOCTOR WEST ABOUT MY HUSBAND'S IMPOTENCE MARGARET 
I THOUGHT IT WAS YOUR CAR I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE 
I CAN'T JUST BLURT IT OUT TO HER I'LL TELL HER IN MY OWN TIME
