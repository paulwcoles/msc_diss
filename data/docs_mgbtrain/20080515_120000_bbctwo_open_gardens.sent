EVERY YEAR HUNDREDS OF BRITISH GARDENERS TRY DESPERATELY TO GET A PLACE IN THE YELLOW BOOK 
THIS ANNUAL GUIDE PUBLISHED BY THE NATIONAL GARDENS SCHEME 
LISTS PRIVATE GARDENS BRILLIANT ENOUGH TO BE OPEN FOR CHARITY 
FOR THE FEW ACCEPTED INTO THIS YELLOW BOOK IT MEANS THE WORLD TO SHARE THEIR GARDENS WITH THE PUBLIC 
BUT OUT OF EIGHT HUNDRED APPLICANTS EACH YEAR ONLY HALF WILL GET THROUGH 
AND WITH SUCH HIGH STANDARDS OF ENTRY THE ASSESSMENT IS RUTHLESS 
AT THE MOMENT THERE ISN'T ANY INTEREST WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
THIS IS A MONSTROSITY I'M GOING TO SAY NO 
I OUGHT TO SAY NO THIS YEAR I'LL SAY NO 
IN THIS PROGRAMME I'LL BE FOLLOWING AVID GARDENERS 
STRIVING TO TURN THEIR PRIVATE PARADISES INTO OPEN GARDENS 
TODAY I'LL BE MEETING TWO COUPLES WHO ARE HOPING THEIR GARDEN CAN MAKE THE GRADE 
I THINK IT WOULD BE A REAL LET DOWN 
IF THE COUNTY ORGANISER DECIDED IT WASN'T A VERY INTERESTING GARDEN 
IF THEY SAY NO WE REALLY WILL BE VERY UPSET 
WILL TODAY'S GARDENS HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO GET ACCEPTED INTO THE PRESTIGIOUS YELLOW BOOK 
OUR FIRST GARDEN BELONGS TO LISE AND CHRIS WHITE IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE 
THIS SUMPTUOUS ENGLISH COTTAGE GARDEN IS A REAL LABOUR OF LOVE 
IT'S TAKEN LISE AND CHRIS THIRTY YEARS TO TRANSFORM 
WHAT WAS A BARREN FIELD INTO A GARDENER'S PARADISE 
EVERY CORNER YOU TURN ROUND REVEALS NEW SURPRISES 
FROM THE WALLED COTTAGE GARDEN TO THE SUNKEN COURTYARD 
FROM TWO PRETTY LITTLE PONDS TO A REALLY LAVISH VEGETABLE PLOT 
THE WHOLE PLACE IS FULL OF HORTICULTURAL DELIGHTS 
HUSBAND AND WIFE TEAM LISE AND CHRIS WORK TIRELESSLY 
ON THIS DELIGHTFUL GARDEN IN BETWEEN THEIR PROFESSIONAL JOBS 
LISE IS A PART TIME TEACHER AND CHRIS A PROFESSIONAL POTTER 
THE GARDEN IS ONE OF MY MOST FAVOURITE PLACES TO BE 
I DON'T FEEL I NEED TO GO OFF TO TAHITI BECAUSE I LOVE BEING IN MY OWN GARDEN 
BY THE COTTAGE THERE'S A FLOWER GARDEN AND SUNKEN PATIO 
WE MOVE UP TO THE WATER GARDEN WITH TWO PONDS AN ORCHARD 
A WOODLAND WITH A SUMMER HOUSE AND A VEGETABLE PLOT 
WITH LISE AND CHRIS LEADING BUSY LIVES THE GARDEN IS A WAY FOR THEM TO SPEND TIME TOGETHER 
THERE'S A LOT OF CALLING OUT FROM ONE SIDE OF THE GARDEN TO THE OTHER 
COME AND SEE WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING THIS GOES ON A LOT 
WE DO SHARE A LOT OF ACTIVITIES AND WE DO SHARE IN THE PLANNING 
WHERE IS IT YOU WANT IT WE'LL DO THIS BED AFTERWARDS LET'S GO AND DO THIS ONE 
LISE DIDN'T REALISE HOW IMPORTANT THE GARDEN WAS TO HER 
UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN SHE WAS STRUCK DOWN BY A MYSTERY ILLNESS AND LOST HER VOICE FOR A WHOLE YEAR 
I DO BELIEVE GARDENING HELPED ME IN RECOVERING MY VOICE 
BECAUSE OF THE RELAXING ASPECT OF GARDENING 
AND THERE WAS ONE EXAMPLE PARTICULARLY 
WHEN SOMEBODY CAME AND CALLED MY NAME FROM THE HOUSE 
AND I ANSWERED WITH A VOICE 
IT SHOWED TO ME THE HEALING PROPERTIES OF GARDENING AND THE RELAXING PROPERTIES OF GARDENING 
I THINK THIS WHOLE BUSINESS OF OPENING FOR THE N. G.S IS REALLY GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR LISE 
BECAUSE IT WILL VALIDATE THE CREATIVITY SHE HAS PUT INTO IT 
SHE'S GOT HUGE CREATIVITY WHICH SHE NEVER FOUND THE RIGHT OUTLET FOR UNTIL SHE DISCOVERED GARDENING 
IT WOULD BE A REAL LET DOWN IF THE COUNTY ORGANISER DECIDED THAT IT WASN'T A VERY INTERESTING GARDEN 
WITH THE ASSESSMENT IN A WEEK'S TIME LISE AND CHRIS HAVE REASONS TO BE CONCERNED 
EVEN ON A RAINY DAY THIS GARDEN IS FULL OF INTEREST 
THERE'S EVEN A WORKING POTTERY BUT THIS STEEP SLOPE IN FRONT OF THE TWO PONDS IS A BIT OF A HAZARD 
WHAT WILL THE COUNTY ORGANISER MAKE OF IT 
COULD IT KEEP LISE AND CHRIS OUT OF THE PRESTIGIOUS YELLOW BOOK 
THE COUNTY ORGANISER FOR GLOUCESTERSHIRE WHO COULD STAND IN THE WAY OF LISE AND CHRIS' DREAMS 
IS STELLA MARTIN 
IF HER GARDEN IS ANYTHING TO GO BY THE ASSESSMENT WILL BE REALLY TOUGH 
I REALLY WOULDN'T LIKE TO ACCEPT A GARDEN 
IF IT HAD AN UNTIDY POND WHICH IS COVERED IN SCUM 
AND OF COURSE HEALTH AND SAFETY IS TERRIBLY IMPORTANT 
SO ANYWHERE THAT PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO FALL DOWN MUST BE LOOKED AT AND AVOIDED 
TODAY'S SECOND GARDEN IS BOWLING GREEN COTTAGE IN WEST CORNWALL 
HERE JUST A FEW MILES INLAND FROM A COAST THAT IS WARMED BY THE GULF STREAM 
IS THE MOST FABULOUS COLLECTION OF ORNAMENTAL SPECIES 
THAT YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY GROW ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE BRITISH ISLES 
IN SOME GARDENS YOU COULD BE ANYWHERE BUT HERE THE PLANTS LET YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE 
THIS SUPERLATIVE CORNISH GARDEN BELONGS TO CAROL LAY AND MINING CONSULTANT HUSBAND STEPHEN 
THEY'VE BATTLED AGAINST THE ELEMENTS FOR FOURTEEN YEARS TO GET IT INTO SHAPE FOR THE YELLOW BOOK 
IT'S A VERY TRANQUIL PLACE 
IT'S A PLACE WHERE LOTS OF LOVELY THINGS HAVE HAPPENED WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND IT'S A SPECIAL PLACE 
THIS TWENTY FIVE ACRE SITE COMPRISES A FORMAL COTTAGE GARDEN NEAR THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY MINE HOUSE 
AND A WALLED GARDEN WITH MINING MEMORABILIA 
IN THE TOP FIELD IS A WILD MEADOW 
AND THE BOTTOM FIELD IS NOW A WOODLAND WITH WETLAND HABITAT 
FOR CAROL THE GARDEN HAS RECENTLY BECOME EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT 
NOW I SPEND NEARLY EVERY DAY WORKING IN THE GARDEN 
HAVING GIVEN UP MY FULL TIME JOB AS A TEACHER TO TAKE THINGS EASY 
I WORK HARDER NOW THAN I USED TO 
GETTING INTO THE YELLOW BOOK WILL BE PRETTY IMPORTANT TO CAROL 
I THINK WE WILL BE DISMAYED IF WE DON'T GET IN THERE 
WE'VE PUT IN A LOT OF WORK TO TRY AND IMPRESS THEM 
STEVE AND I HAVE QUITE CLEAR ROLES IN THE GARDEN 
HE DOES THE HEAVY WORK AND I DO THE NICE PLANTING 
AND GOING OFF TO THE NURSERIES AND RESEARCHING WHAT WOULD LOOK GOOD 
WE'RE HERE FOR THE LONG TERM AND WE'RE MAKING AN ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO LIVE IN 
THIS IS SUCH AN INTERESTING GARDEN I HAD TO DELVE A LITTLE DEEPER 
SO ARE YOU BOTH CORNISH 
STEPHEN'S CORNISH AND CAROL'S CORNISH I'VE LIVED HERE SINCE I WAS THREE SO I'M CORNISH NOW 
DID YOU CHOOSE IT BECAUSE OF THE LOCATION AS IT FEELS SO CORNISH 
ABSOLUTELY BEFORE WE WERE LIVING IN A FISHING VILLAGE BUT THE HOUSE WAS FAR TOO SMALL 
WE HAD NO OUTSIDE AT ALL AND THIS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE DID YOU PLANT ALL THOSE TREES 
NO WHEN WE PLANTED THE FIELD I WAS WORKING AT A SPECIAL SCHOOL IN REDRUTH 
I BROUGHT MY STUDENTS OVER AND WITH THEM WE PLANTED EIGHT HUNDRED PLUS TREES IN A WEEK 
IN A WEEK IN A WEEK A HARD TASKMASTER I WAS I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY 
SO WHY DO YOU WANT TO SHARE THE GARDEN WITH OTHER PEOPLE 
IN THE MIDDLE OF LAST YEAR I WAS STANDING OUT ON THE TERRACE AND JUST LOOKING AT EVERYTHING 
I SAID STEPHEN THIS IS WONDERFUL WE SHOULD SHARE IT WITH PEOPLE 
HE SAID WELL DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT HOW WILL YOU FEEL IF YOU'RE NOT ACCEPTED 
A BIT LET DOWN HAVING DONE ALL THIS AND GOT AS FAR AS SOMEBODY ACTUALLY COMING TO LOOK 
AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE HAPPY AND WON'T SAY NO 
LET'S KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED FOR THIS ASSESSMENT WE HOPE SO 
WITH THE ASSESSMENT HAPPENING TOMORROW THEY'LL NEED TO CROSS MORE THAN JUST THEIR FINGERS 
CAROL AND STEPHEN HAVE GOT TWO AND A HALF ACRES AND GARDENING IS NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD HERE AT ALL 
SOMETIMES EVEN THE MOST BASIC TASKS GET PUSHED TO ONE SIDE 
WHEN THE COUNTY ORGANISER ASSESSES THE GARDEN IS SHE GOING TO FEEL THERE'S STILL JUST TOO MUCH TO DO 
THE PERSON THEIR GARDEN NEEDS TO IMPRESS 
IS THE ASSISTANT COUNTY ORGANISER FOR CORNWALL MARION STANLEY 
BUT LOOKING AT HER GARDEN CAROL AND STEPHEN COULD BE IN TROUBLE 
WHEN I VIEW A GARDEN WITHOUT ALL THE QUALITIES THE N. G.S LOOKS FOR 
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO BE QUITE HONEST AND OBJECTIVE 
IT HAS TO THEREFORE COME UP TO EXPECTATIONS 
TODAY IT'S TIME FOR OUR TWO GARDENS TO FACE THE ULTIMATE TEST 
THE QUESTION IS WILL THEY BE GOOD ENOUGH 
IN CORNWALL MARION IS ON THE WAY TO BOWLING GREEN COTTAGE 
CAROL AND STEPHEN'S TWO AND A HALF ACRE COUNTRY GARDEN 
HELLO HELLO I'M MARION STANLEY FROM THE NATIONAL GARDENS SCHEME 
WILL THE AMOUNT OF WORK TO BE DONE MEAN THEIR DOWNFALL 
OVER AT HOOKSHOUSE THE COUNTY ORGANISER FOR GLOUCESTERSHIRE 
HAS ARRIVED AT LISE AND CHRIS' COTTAGE GARDEN 
HI I'M STELLA MARTIN NATIONAL GARDENS SCHEME 
COULD HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES END THEIR YELLOW BOOK DREAMS 
SO THE VISITORS WOULD COME IN THIS WAY WOULD THEY 
YES ALSO WE WOULD HAVE THEM ENDING UP HERE WE'D HAVE A GARDEN TABLE AND CHAIRS HERE AND SERVE TEAS 
THAT WOULD BE LOVELY YES 
SETTING AN AREA ASIDE FOR TEAS HAS GONE DOWN WELL 
IN CORNWALL MARION IS LED STRAIGHT TO THE WALLED GARDEN 
OH MY WORD WHAT IS THAT 
THIS IS OUR HOLMAN ROCK DRILL AS YOU KNOW THE HOUSE WAS PART OF THE MINING COUNT HOUSE NO I DIDN'T 
FOR VISITORS COMING IN IT'S A BIT OF A HAZARD 
BUT THE VISITORS WILL WANT TO KNOW ALL ABOUT THIS 
IT'S A MIXED RECEPTION FOR THE ROCK DRILL 
BACK IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE STELLA COMES ACROSS THE POND AREA 
SO THIS IS THE POND AREA YES 
A LITTLE BIT UNTIDY HERE AT THE MOMENT 
WE HAVE TO OWN UP TO THAT 
IN CORNWALL THEY COME ACROSS CAROL'S UNFINISHED BED 
BUT THIS ONE IS COMPLETELY EMPTY YES IT IS 
YOU INTEND TO MATCH THE DRY STONE WALL STEVE WILL BUILD ANOTHER WALL 
NEXT UP FOR LISE AND CHRIS IS THE GRASS BANK 
BIT OF A WORRY THAT BECAUSE IT'S A BIT STEEP AND MAYBE SLIPPERY IF THE GRASS IS WET 
I CAN IMAGINE CHILDREN PLAYING ON THE GRASS AT THE TOP THEN RUSHING DOWN AND YOU'VE GOT THE POND HERE 
HEALTH AND SAFETY IS ALSO A CONCERN FOR CAROL IN CORNWALL 
SO THIS IS YOUR ENLARGED POND OUR ENLARGED POND YES OUR LAKE 
THE GENERAL PUBLIC IF YOU WERE TO GET IN THE BOOK 
WOULD YOU DIRECT THEM AROUND THE PONDS YES AND WE'D HAVE TO PUT SIGNS UP TO SAY THE WATER WAS DEEP 
THE ASSESSMENT IS FINISHED AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE RESULTS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SHOWING ME ROUND THE GARDEN 
IT'S GOOD OF YOU TO GIVE UP YOUR TIME 
I'M NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THE POND AREA I THINK THAT DOES NEED QUITE A BIT OF WORK DOING ON IT 
THE GRANITE MINING ZONE WHERE YOU'VE GOT GRANITE PAVEMENTS 
IT NEEDS INTERESTING PLANTING THERE THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR PAVEMENTS 
AND THE GRASSY BANK AT THE SIDE 
THAT'S QUITE DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY 
PEOPLE MIGHT SLIP ON THAT AND CHILDREN MIGHT RUN DOWN THERE 
YOU NEED ANOTHER DRY STONE WALL INTO YOUR MEADOW WALK 
AND THE ENTIRE BARE BED OBVIOUSLY THAT NEEDS TO BE PLANTED 
WILL IT BE A YES OR NO FOR LISE AND CHRIS 
SO SOME MIXED FEELINGS THERE I THINK REALLY 
ALL IN ALL I THINK WE WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME YOU INTO THE NATIONAL GARDENS SCHEME 
REALLY 
THEY'RE IN THIS GORGEOUS GARDEN WILL BE OPENING TO THE PUBLIC IN A MERE THREE MONTHS 
BUT CAN THEY GET EVERYTHING DONE 
ALONGSIDE FEELING REALLY PLEASED THERE'S ALSO NOW WE'VE GOT TO GET IT RIGHT AND DO THIS WORK 
WILL CAROL AND HER GARDEN IN CORNWALL MAKE IT OR IS THERE TOO MUCH WORK TO BE DONE 
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE WAY TO GO 
BECAUSE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WILL WANT TO COME AND SEE THIS GARDEN I HOPE SO 
SO AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME I'M GOING TO SAY NO 
CAROL HASN'T GOT IN BUT SHE'S GOT FOUR MONTHS BEFORE MARION RETURNS FOR ANOTHER ASSESSMENT 
WE'VE DONE SO MUCH WORK IN THE GARDEN AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FIRST TIME 
BUT SHE DID SAY IF WE DID THE WORK THEN MAYBE SHE WOULD RECONSIDER 
SO WE'VE JUST GOT TO KNUCKLE DOWN NOW AND DO SOME PLANTING AND DO SOME SORTING OUT 
IT'S BEEN A MONTH SINCE THE ASSESSMENT AT HOOKSHOUSE IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE 
ALTHOUGH LISE AND CHRIS WILL OPEN TO THE PUBLIC IN TWO MONTHS' TIME 
THE COUNTY ORGANISER DID HAVE HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS OVER THE BANK LEADING TO THE POND 
IT'S LOVELY TO LOOK DOWN ON HERE BUT I CAN SEE WHAT SHE MEANS ABOUT THIS SLOPE YES 
I THINK THE TEMPTATION WOULD BE THAT YOUR VISITORS WOULD JUST WANT TO GO DOWN ANYWHERE AT ALL YES 
BUT IF YOU HAD SOME STEPS HERE IT WOULD BE A REAL FOCUS 
AND IT'S AMAZING HOW QUICKLY PEOPLE GET THE MESSAGE THAT THAT'S THE WAY DOWN 
YES SO I THINK THEY SHOULD BE REALLY QUITE WIDE STEPS 
SO WHAT KIND OF STEPS WOULD YOU IMAGINE FOR THIS PLACE YOU SHOULD PROBABLY MAKE THEM FROM SLEEPERS 
I LIKE THE IDEA OF SLEEPERS 
COS THEY'RE BIG SIMPLE AND IF YOU'RE IN A HURRY WHICH WE ARE 
I THINK THEY'RE A GOOD SOLUTION 
SO LET'S HAVE A GO I THINK THAT'S MORE SLEEPER LENGTH DON'T YOU 
WHENEVER YOU'RE CREATING SOME STEPS IN A GARDEN 
I RECOMMEND THAT YOU MARK THEM OUT FIRST USING BAMBOO CANES 
YOU'LL GET A REAL IDEA OF HOW MANY STEPS ARE NEEDED AND HOW IT WILL LOOK WHEN IT'S FINISHED 
TRY THEM OUT IT'S ALMOST AS IF THEY WERE THERE ALREADY 
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO NOW IS BUY THE SLEEPERS DIG THE HOLES AND PUT THEM IN 
ONCE THE STEPS ARE FINISHED THEY SHOULD RESOLVE ANY HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS 
AT BOWLING GREEN COTTAGE IN CORNWALL CAROL DIDN'T MAKE IT INTO THE YELLOW BOOK FOR THIS YEAR 
BUT SHE'S GOT THREE MONTHS BEFORE SHE'S REASSESSED 
ARE YOU TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU DIDN'T GET IN 
YES I FEEL A BIT LET DOWN BECAUSE I THOUGHT WE WORKED VERY HARD AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED 
BUT THEY WERE VERY POSITIVE AND TOLD US IF WE WORKED EVEN HARDER 
THEY WOULD COME BACK AND RECONSIDER 
THIS IS ONE AREA THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM 
THIS IS A LOVELY EARTH BANK YOU'VE GOT A ROCK WALL ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT THERE ISN'T ONE HERE 
DO YOU WANT TO REPEAT THE PLANTING NO I WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
I WAS THINKING OF CANNAS AND GRASSES MAKE IT QUITE EXOTIC AND HOT THIS IS MORE TRADITIONAL 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THOSE CANNAS OVER THERE 
THESE ARE THE PLANTS I WAS THINKING ABOUT PUTTING IN THIS BED WHERE HAVE THEY BEEN OVER WINTER 
THE CANNAS HAVE BEEN IN THE GREENHOUSE I SEPARATED THEM OUT AND PUT THEM IN POTS 
I THINK I'VE GOT FIFTEEN NOW THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH 
I'M GOING FOR THIS ONE YOU'VE GOT THE BIGGEST I'M NOT GREEDY 
SO WHERE DO YOU WANT THEM IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER 
NO WE'VE GOT A BARE CANVAS HERE 
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SEVERAL OF THESE 
THE RED ONES TOGETHER AND THEN THE OTHER ONES TOGETHER 
YEAH I LOVE THAT I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
YOU'VE GOT SO MUCH LIGHT IN YOUR GARDEN 
AND ONE ADVANTAGE OF THESE CANNA LEAVES IS WHEN YOU SEE THEM BACKLIT 
YOU CAN SEE EVERY NUANCE OF THEIR LEAVES 
AND THE THING ABOUT CANNAS IS THEY'VE GOT THESE TUBEROUS ROOTS 
AS LONG AS THEY DON'T GET FROZEN AND YOU PROTECT THEM FROM THE FROST YOU CAN LEAVE THEM IN THE GROUND 
AND I THINK THE BEST WAY TO DO IT IS PUTTING A LOAD OF SOIL OVER THE TOP OF WHERE THEY'VE DIED DOWN TO 
THAT LOOKS ABOUT RIGHT DOESN'T IT 
I THINK THIS BED IS GOING TO LOOK PRETTY SPECTACULAR I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING IT DONE 
THEY LOOK GOOD ALREADY 
GETTING AWAY FROM WHAT NEEDS PLANTING LET'S LOOK AT ONE PLANT THAT'S ALREADY HERE 
IN THEIR CORNISH GARDEN CAROL AND STEVE HAVE THE LUXURY OF GROWING ALL SORTS OF THINGS 
THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULDN'T GET AWAY WITH AND THIS IS ONE MYRTLE 
YOU SEE IT ALL OVER CORNWALL AND DEVON AND THE TRADITION WAS THAT WHEN A BRIDE WAS MARRIED 
SHE'D TAKE A SPRIG OF MYRTLE FROM HER MOTHER'S GARDEN PUT IT INTO HER BOUQUET 
AND AFTERWARDS AT HER OWN HOUSE SHE'D PLANT IT AGAIN 
IT'S COVERED IN WHITE FLOWERS LATER ON AND THE SCENT OF THE FOLIAGE AND THE FLOWERS IS UNBELIEVABLE 
IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE THERE IS JUST ONE MONTH TO GO 
AND LISE AND CHRIS ARE PUTTING THE SLEEPERS INTO PLACE USING THE TECHNOLOGY USED TO BUILD STONEHENGE 
IT'S THE CRITICAL MOMENT IS IT GOING TO GO IN 
MY REPUTATION DEPENDS ON IT DOESN'T IT RIGHT SHALL WE 
LET GO A BIT FURTHER FORWARD THAT'S IT IT'S IN 
IT FITS PERFECTLY IT'S FANTASTIC WELL DONE YOU MEASURED IT CORRECTLY 
ALL WE NEED TO DO NOW IS THE OTHER SIX 
SHALL WE TRY IT THIS IS OUR FIRST STEP 
ON TOP OF OPENING FOR THE N. G.S FOR THE FIRST TIME LISE AND CHRIS WILL ALSO HAVE AN ART EXHIBITION 
AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH THEY'RE OPENING FOR A WHOLE NINE DAYS 
WE OPEN FROM I THINK IT'S THE TWENTY SIXTH OF MAY 
TO THE THIRD OF JUNE 
A SOLID WEEK PLUS A WEEKEND AND THEN ONE MORE DAY IN JULY 
THE PRESSURE FOR ONE DAY CAN BE BAD ENOUGH NINE IS UNBELIEVABLE 
AND WITH ALL THE WORK STILL LEFT TO BE DONE IS IT GETTING TO THEM 
I AM A BIT NERVOUS ABOUT BEING OPEN FOR N. G.S PEOPLE COMING ROUND 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING 
I'M SURE LISE IS NERVOUS TOO 
WE'RE GETTING ON VERY WELL WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME AIM 
BUT SOMETIMES WE GET A BIT FRIGHTENED WILL WE GET THERE 
IT WAS VERY TENSE ON SATURDAY 
WE'VE GOT TOO MUCH TO DO WE'LL NEVER GET THERE ON TIME 
WILL WE TIME WILL TELL 
IN CORNWALL CAROL'S HARD AT WORK 
SHE'S TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE AREAS THAT LED TO FAILURE WON'T LET HER DOWN SECOND TIME AROUND 
WE'RE TRYING TO PLANT OUT THE ROCKERY AROUND THE ROCK DRILL 
SO THAT WHEN PEOPLE COME THEY GET THE WOW EFFECT 
BUT WE STILL HAVE THE REST OF THE WALL TO BUILD OVER BY ONE OF THE FLOWER BEDS 
THE N. G.S HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT 
IF THEY COME BACK AND SAY NO WE REALLY WILL BE VERY UPSET 
BUT WITH ONLY MONTH TO GO BEFORE HER REASSESSMENT CAROL STILL HAS A HUGE TASK TO GET EVERYTHING DONE 
AND THE JURY IS STILL OUT ON WHETHER OR NOT SHE'LL MANAGE IT 
IT'S THE END OF MAY AT HOOKSHOUSE IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE 
AND IT'S THE FIRST DAY OF LISE AND CHRIS' NINE DAY GARDEN OPENING AND ART EXHIBITION 
JUST AN HOUR TO GO BEFORE LISE AND CHRIS' VERY FIRST OPEN DAY FOR THE N. G.S 
LET'S HOPE THAT THE LANES ARE GOING TO BE TEEMING WITH TRAFFIC 
WITH PEOPLE FALLING OVER THEMSELVES TO VIEW THIS COMPLETELY WONDERFUL AND ESOTERIC GARDEN 
WHILE CHRIS IS OUT PUTTING UP THE SIGNS TO MAKE SURE VISITORS KNOW HOW TO FIND THEM 
LISE IS BUSYING HERSELF WITH FINAL PREPARATIONS 
WELL IT'S ALL VERY EXCITING 
WHEN I WOKE UP I THOUGHT THIS IS THE DAY I'VE GOT TO GET UP QUICK 
AT THE MOMENT I'M STILL FEELING VERY TENSE ABOUT IT ALL 
THERE'S ALREADY A CAR SITTING ON THE YARD MY GOODNESS IT'S TIME TO OPEN 
LISE AND CHRIS' DIVINE GARDEN IS OPEN AND JUST LOOK HOW MUCH IT'S CHANGED 
ONCE DULL BORDERS ARE NOW TEEMING WITH VIVACIOUS COLOUR 
EVEN THE PLANTING AROUND THE POND LOOKS BREATHTAKING 
THE NEW STEPS HAVE GIVEN THIS PART OF THE GARDEN A NEW PERSPECTIVE 
AND HAVING SCULPTURES FOR THE ART EXHIBITION STRATEGICALLY PLACED ADDS TO THE BEAUTY OF THE GARDEN 
IT ISN'T LONG BEFORE PEOPLE ARRIVE TO ADMIRE IT 
THERE IS SUCH A VARIETY OF LITTLE AREAS THAT YOU CAN WALK INTO 
AND YOU'RE IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT 
THIS IS A LOVELY GARDEN AND WITH THE SCULPTURES IN IT IT MAKES IT THAT LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIAL 
OUT THERE AMONGST THE SCULPTURES IS STELLA THE COUNTY ORGANISER 
I HAVE NO REGRETS ABOUT ACCEPTING THEM FOR THE SCHEME 
THIS GARDEN IS LOOKING FANTASTIC I'M REALLY REALLY PLEASED WITH IT 
SO HAVE YOU REALLY ENJOYED YOURSELVES 
YES IT'S BEEN REALLY GREAT IT WAS FANTASTIC A REALLY REALLY GOOD DAY 
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU MADE WE THINK ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AT LEAST THAT PROBABLY MORE 
HAS ANYBODY COMMENTED ABOUT YOUR BRAND NEW STEPS I THINK THE STEPS ARE A GREAT SUCCESS 
I THINK THEY'RE GREAT I THINK THEY'RE FANTASTIC WHOSE IDEA WAS THAT THEN 
WELL WE HAD THE IDEA WE SORT OF HAD THE IDEA BUT YOU SUGGESTED THE SLEEPERS 
YOU DIDN'T TELL US HOW HEAVY THEY WOULD BE AND WOULD YOU DO IT AGAIN YES DEFINITELY YES 
I'M SURE THE NATIONAL GARDENS SCHEME WOULD LOVE IT CHEERS 
AND HERE'S TO THE N. G.S CHEERS 
THE FIRST DAY WAS PERFECT AND CHRIS AND LISE ONLY HAVE EIGHT MORE TO GET THROUGH 
IN CORNWALL IT'S HOURS UNTIL CAROL'S REASSESSMENT AT BOWLING GREEN COTTAGE 
ALTHOUGH SHE LOOKS CALM AND COLLECTED HUSBAND STEPHEN KNOWS THE TRUTH 
CAROL IS VERY NERVOUS NOW THE REASSESSMENT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN 
SHE'S SPENDING ALL HOURS OUT IN THE GARDEN WEEDING BRUSHING AND MAKING IT LOOK SPICK AND SPAN 
I'VE COME ALONG TO LEND A LITTLE SUPPORT 
LOOK AT THIS WONDERFUL WALL IT'S LOOKING PRETTY GOOD NOW 
IT HAS MADE A MASSIVE DIFFERENCE AND THIS IS ALL PLANTED 
SHE'S DUE ANY MINUTE ISN'T SHE YEAH 
HOW ARE YOU FEELING VERY NERVOUS I KEEP SEEING ANOTHER WEED POKING UP 
LET'S KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED 
CAROL AND STEPHEN COULD HARDLY HAVE WORKED HARDER 
GETTING THIS HUGE GARDEN TO LOOK AS MARVELLOUS AS IT DOES 
THE RAISED BED LOOKS SENSATIONAL WITH ITS NEW WALL 
THE COTTAGE GARDEN IS A RIOT OF COLOUR 
AND THE PLANTING IN THE AREA WITH THE ROCK DRILL REALLY DELIVERS THE WOW FACTOR CAROL WAS AFTER 
BUT IT ISN'T ME THEY HAVE TO IMPRESS IT'S CORNWALL'S ASSISTANT COUNTY ORGANISER MARION STANLEY 
THIS IS THE NEW WALL THAT WE BUILT CREATING THE NEW WALKWAY THROUGH HERE VERY EFFECTIVE ISN'T IT 
I THINK SO IT FINISHES IT OFF WITH THE NEW FLOWER BED 
HAVE THEY NOTICED YOUR WALL I HOPE SO SHE'S SMILING GOOD SIGN 
YEAH IT'S LOOKING GOOD ISN'T IT 
MY WORD CAROL YOU HAVE MADE SOME PROGRESS 
THIS IS WONDERFUL A REAL WOW FACTOR FEATURE ISN'T IT IT IS 
WE'RE REALLY PLEASED WITH THE WAY IT'S COMING ALONG IT'S SUCH A CHANGE AND IT'S SUCH A FEATURE NOW 
THE REASSESSMENT IS OVER AND NOW IT'S TIME TO SEE IF ALL CAROL'S HARD GRAFT HAS PAID OFF 
CAROL STEPHEN IT'S BEEN A REAL DELIGHT TO WALK AROUND YOUR GARDEN 
YOU'VE MADE SO MUCH PROGRESS PARTICULARLY IN YOUR WALLED WALK THROUGH 
THE DRILL GARDEN IS A REAL WOW FACTOR 
AS FAR AS OPENING FOR THE NATIONAL GARDENS SCHEME 
I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO HAVE YOU ON BOARD THANK YOU WE'D LOVE YOU TO OPEN NEXT SUMMER 
SOMETIMES HARD WORK PAYS OFF IT CERTAINLY DOES DESPITE THE BANK BALANCE OH YES SSH 
AFTER THEIR INITIAL DISAPPOINTMENT CAROL AND STEPHEN WORKED SO HARD 
TO BRING THEIR REALLY INTERESTING GARDEN UP TO SCRATCH 
THEY'VE MADE IT THEY'RE IN THE SCHEME 
I'M SURE WITH ALL ITS INTERESTING AND ESOTERIC FEATURES AND ITS REAL CORNISH QUALITY 
THIS IS GOING TO BE A YELLOW BOOK GARDEN NOBODY WILL FORGET
