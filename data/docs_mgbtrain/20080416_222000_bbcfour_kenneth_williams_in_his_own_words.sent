I CONKED OUT 
THE KENNETH WILLIAMS STORY 
IN OUR OPINION WHAT FOLLOWS IS UNSUITABLE FOR CHILDREN 
I'VE GOT THE DICTION YOU SEE I AVE GOT IT 
OOH EVEN AT DRAMA SCHOOL THEY USED TO SAY YOU GOT THE DICTION KENNY 
GO ON SHOW US YOUR DICTION 
IT'S STARK IT'S SAVAGE 
IT'S SORDID IT'S SOUL SEARING 
IT'S A LIE 
PULLED MY WAY UP FROM THE GUTTER I COULDA BEEN A STAR 
THAT'S ALL YOU WANT ME FOR GETTING CHEAP LAUGHS 
OH STOP MESSIN' ABOUT 
GOOD EVENING GOOD EVENING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND WELCOME TO A VERY SPECIAL PROGRAMME 
THIS IS NONE OF THE RUN OF THE MILL RUBBISH IT'S BEEN VERY CAREFULLY PUT TOGETHER 
THIS SHOW ISN'T JUST KNOCKED OFF 
SOME OF THE SCRIPT MAY BE BUT THAT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH ME 
THIS SHOW TICKLES YOUR FANCY DOTS YOUR T.'S AND CROSSES YOUR EYES 
THEY'LL PROBABLY STAY CROSSED AFTER YOU'VE SEEN THE NEXT BIT 
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I'M A LONDONER 
THAT I LOVE LONDON TOWN 
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I'M A LONDONER 
THAT I THINK OF HER WHEREVER I GO 
ONE NIGHT IN A MODEST WELL KEPT LITTLE COTTAGE 
BEHIND SAINT PANCRAS STATION 
AS THE PARENTS GAZED WONDROUSLY AT THEIR NEW OFFSPRING 
THERE WAS A TENDER SILENCE AND THEN HIS FATHER PUTTING A COMFORTING ARM ROUND HIS WIFE'S SHOULDER SPOKE 
OH REALLY DO WE HAVE TO BRING THAT UP 
I USED TO PHOTOGRAPH AWFULLY WELL AS A CHILD 
ALL MY RELATIVES STILL TREASURE PORTRAITS OF ME 
I WAS CURLY 
OH YOU WEREN'T 
YES 
HOW LOVELY YOU MUST'VE BEEN 
THANK YOU 
IT WAS WHAT WE'D CALL AN UNDERPRIVILEGED BACKGROUND WASN'T IT 
THEY LIVED IN ONE ROOM OFF THE CALEDONIAN ROAD I SUPPOSE THAT'S UNDERPRIVILEGED YES 
DID YOU FEEL YOURSELF IN ANY WAY UNDERPRIVILEGED WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD 
YES IN THE SENSE OF SEEING OTHER PEOPLE HAVING BETTER CONDITIONS THAN I HAD AND FEELING THAT I REALLY 
SHOULD HAVE THEM TOO I SUPPOSE AS A CHILD 
AND THAT DID OCCUR ONCE OR TWICE WITH CHILDREN AT SCHOOL WHO WERE BETTER DRESSED THAN I WAS 
I DID FEEL OCCASIONALLY TWINGES OF ENVY ABOUT IT 
CROMER HOUSES WHERE I CAME TO LIVE WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG 
AND FROM THAT WINDOW WITH THE RED GERANIUMS 
I USED TO THROW FLOWERPOTS ON TO THE HEADS OF PASSERS BY 
AND ONE OF THEM HAPPENED TO BE FLORRIE PLUME 
WHO WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF MY MOTHER'S AND SHE SAID AFTERWARDS 
IT WAS ONLY WEARING THAT THICK FELT HAT THAT SAVED ME FROM A TERRIBLE INJURY FROM YOUR BOY 
WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR EDUCATION 
KENNETH WAS SENT TO THE SORT OF SCHOOL 
THAT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET INTO 
IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET OUT OF AS WELL 
AS A SCHOLAR MY RESULTS WERE LAMENTABLE 
I GOT APPALLING MARKS IN MOST SUBJECTS EXCEPT ENGLISH 
AND THAT'S BECAUSE I LIKED THE ENGLISH MASTER 
HE TOOK US FOR READING POETRY ALOUD SHAKESPEARE TENNYSON BROWNING AND HE DIRECTED US IN THE SCHOOL PLAY 
WE REHEARSED IT UP HERE ON THE ROOF 
IT WAS CALLED THE ROSE AND THE RING AND HE GAVE ME A VERY GOOD PART PRINCESS ANGELICA 
AND I STOMPED AROUND WITH MY FEATHER DUSTER SAYING OUT OF MY WAY 
TO EVERYBODY VERY ARISTOCRATICALLY I THOUGHT 
MIND YOU I'D NO REAL IDEA HOW ARISTOCRATS DID BEHAVE 
IT WAS ENTIRELY INSTINCTIVE 
BUT I DID RATHER WELL AND I GOT A VERY GOOD NOTICE IN THE LOCAL PAPER WHICH PLEASED ME 
IN FACT IT WAS MY FIRST TASTE OF PERFORMING 
I REALLY ENJOYED IT 
WHEN DID YOU GET THE FIRST INCLINATIONS TO BE A PERFORMER TO BE ON STAGE 
I THINK THE INSTINCT WAS FROM MY MOTHER LOUISA 
YEAH I GOT IT FROM LOU BECAUSE SHE WOULD COME BACK FROM SHOPPING EXPEDITIONS AND SAY 
AND THAT WOMAN COME IN SHE PUSHED RIGHT IN AND SHE SAID 
OOH I'M NOT PAYIN' PENNY HA'PENNY FOR ARTICHOKES 
OH NO JERUSALEM OR NO JERUSALEM YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO 
YOU CAN STICK 'EM 
I WAS GIVING THESE SORT OF IMPRESSIONS MYSELF YOU KNOW 
AND I GOT THAT ALL FROM MY MOTHER 
YOUR FATHER WOULD'VE WANTED YOU TO DO A PROPER JOB WOULDN'T HE 
OH YES HE DIDN'T LIKE THE ACTING PROFESSION 
HE SAID DON'T TRY THAT PLUMMY VOICE STUFF WITH ME MATE 
DON'T TRY THAT PLUMMY VOICE WITH ME HE HATED THE THEATRE ANYWAY 
HE'D SAY ALL PANSIES AND ORES THAT'S ALL THEY ARE 
DON'T YOU START THAT GET A TRADE BOY YOU HAVE A TRADE BOY 
AAH BONJOUR GUTEN TAG BUON GIORNO SHOLEM ALEYCHEM 
EH I'M SAYING GOOD MORNING 
JUST DEMONSTRATING FOUR OF THE SIXTEEN LANGUAGES I SPEAK FLUENTLY 
FOR YOUR BENEFIT MR. TWIST THERE MUST MUST MUST BE A WORTHWHILE APPOINTMENT FOR ME TODAY 
PLEASE SAY THERE IS PLEASE SAY THERE IS 
MR. COURTNEY YES 
THERE ISN'T 
WHEN I LEFT SCHOOL MY FATHER SAID YOU'VE GOT TO AVE A TRADE BOY 
ONE THING THEY'LL ALWAYS WANT IS MAPS 
PEOPLE HAVE TO FIND THEIR WAY ROUND AVEN'T THEY 
SO I BECAME AN APPRENTICE LITHO DRAUGHTSMAN 
AT EDWARD STANFORD LIMITED MAP MAKERS IN LONG ACRE 
AND EVERY MORNING I CYCLED PROUDLY TO WORK THROUGH BLOOMSBURY 
PAST THE STATUE OF FRANCIS DUKE OF BEDFORD 
AND THOSE INCREDIBLE HOUSES IN THE AREA THAT HOUSED SO MANY FAMOUS ARTISTS 
PEOPLE LIKE VIRGINIA WOOLF MAYNARD KEYNES 
LYTTON STRACHEY EDWARD KNOBLOCK 
IN FACT PEOPLE ALMOST AS ECCENTRIC AS MYSELF 
THE YEARS ROLLED BY AND THE PLAIN AWKWARD BOY GREW UP INTO A PLAIN AWKWARD MAN 
THEN CAME THE WAR AND LIKE SO MANY OTHERS 
KENNETH WILLIAMS DID WHAT HE KNEW HE HAD TO DO 
BUT THEY CAUGHT HIM 
STAND TO ATTENTION WHEN I'M TALKING WHY WHY DON'T ASK WHY 
DO AS YOU'RE TOLD YOU'RE IN THE ARMY OH NOT QUITE 
I'M STILL A CIVILIAN WITH CIVILIAN RIGHTS 
AND DON'T SHOUT PLEASE 
WHAT IS YOUR NAME 
PLEASE BAILEY 
JAMES BAILEY HOW DO YOU DO 
FINE ABSOLUTELY BLOODY FINE 
BUT I'LL FEEL EVEN BETTER ONCE YOU'RE IN UNIFORM 
IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR I GOT MY CALL UP PAPERS 
AND I HAD TO COME HERE TO THE DRILL HALL IN DUKE STREET 
THE ARTISTS' RIFLES ACTUALLY 
AND BE MEDICALLY EXAMINED FOR ARMY SERVICE 
I WENT IN WITH CONSIDERABLE FEAR AND TREPIDATION I CAN TELL YOU 
I WAS PARADED IN ALL MY EMBARRASSING NAKEDNESS BEFORE THESE ARMY MEDICAL OFFICERS 
AND THEY ALL MADE TERRIBLE NOISES OF DISBELIEF 
OH GOOD GRIEF OH FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE 
OH WHAT A REVOLTING BODY 
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE MAN 
PULL YOUR STOMACH ROUND TO THE FRONT 
RIDICULOUS 
I HAD ME BACK TO HIM AT THE TIME 
WELL THE IDEA OF HOLDING GUNS AND KILLING PEOPLE IS ABHORRENT TO ME 
QUITE APART FROM THE FACT THAT I'M NOT REALLY BORN FOR THAT KIND OF THING 
I DON'T LOOK GOOD WITH GUNS YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
SOME PEOPLE CAN HOLD THEM AND DO ALL THIS AND LOOK KIND OF TOUGH AND IT REALLY ISN'T MY FORTE 
WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THIS AS PART OF ONE'S LIMITATIONS DON'T WE AS I REMINDED YOU LAST WEEK 
WE'VE ALL GOT THEM HAVEN'T WE 
AFTER THIS HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO COMBINED SERVICES ENTERTAINMENT 
WHICH ORGANISED SHOWS FOR THE TROOPS SOMETIMES PERILOUSLY NEAR THE FRONT LINE 
SAID A FATHER TO HIS SON 
YOU'VE GOT A GREAT BIG JOB TO DO 
A JOB THAT MUST BE DONE 
IN THE ARMY YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SOLDIERS AND YET OF COURSE 
AT NIGHT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO PUT MAKE UP ON AND COME ON IN VARIOUS COSTUMES AND ALL THE REST OF IT 
AND IN OUR UNIT WHICH WAS SINGAPORE THE COMMANDING OFFICER WAS AT GREAT PAINS TO SAY 
THOUGH YOU'RE ARTISTS 
I ACCEPT THAT YOU'RE ARTISTS EITHER PIANISTS OR INSTRUMENTALISTS OR WHATEVER 
AND SOME OF YOU ARE DOING THE SKETCHES DRESSED UP AS WOMEN 
NEVERTHELESS YOU WILL GO AROUND THIS PARADE GROUND IN NEE SOON 
LIKE SOLDIERS 
I WILL HAVE ON THIS PARADE 
YOU WILL ALL SMARTEN UP GET YOUR HAIR CUT AND LOOK LIKE MEN 
I WANT A UNIT FULL OF MEN 
AND FROM THE BACK ROW YOU HEARD OH GET THE MADAM 
AND THERE WAS ALL THIS ANGER ABOUT ANY KIND OF EFFEMINACY 
AND OUR OPENING NUMBER IN THE REVIEW WAS 
WE ALL HAD TO COME ON SINGING 
WE ARE BOYS OF THE SERVICE 
WE'RE AT YOUR SERVICE 
ENTERTAINING YOU 
ONE OF THOSE SORT OF OPENINGS YOU SEE 
HE WATCHED THIS AND SAID OH DREADFUL BOYS OF THE SERVICE 
DREADFUL IT'S TOO EFFEMINATE AND ALL THOSE SIBILANTS BOYS OF THE SERVICE TERRIBLE 
MEN OF THE SERVICE 
NOW GO BACK OFF AND COME ON AGAIN AND SING MEN 
SO WE ALL CAME DOWN 
WE'RE MEN OF THE SERVICE 
AFTER THE WAR THERE WAS REPERTORY THEATRE 
AND AN ACTRESS WHO WORKED WITH HIM HAD THIS TO SAY 
OH YES YES 
I CERTAINLY REMEMBER KENNETH 
WORKING WITH HIM I LEARNT ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING 
WHAT WAS THAT TO LOCK MY DRESSING ROOM DOOR DARLING 
ONE OF YOUR FIRST BIG JOBS WAS WITH ORSON WELLES WAS IT NOT 
YES HE CAME TO SEE SAINT JOAN IN WHICH I PLAYED THE DAUPHIN 
AND HE WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY THAT BECAUSE I DID A VOCAL CHANGE 
IN THE EPILOGUE HE BECOMES THE KING LOUIS THE ELEVENTH 
SO I BEGAN AS A YOUNG PERSON AND ENDED UP AS A VERY OLD MAN 
IN THE BIT WHEN JOAN COMES BACK AND DISCUSSES ALL THAT'S HAPPENED 
AND I DID THIS OLD AND HE WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY THIS AND SAID 
I'VE GOT THIS PLAY I'M DOING MOBY DICK AND I'VE GOT NINE PARTS 
AND I WANT SOMEONE VERSATILE VOCALLY 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO IT AND I SAID YES 
IT WAS A VERY EXTRAORDINARY PRODUCTION COS THERE WAS NO SET 
EVERYTHING WAS LEFT TO THE IMAGINATION 
AND THE WHOLE THING WAS ON A BOAT YOU KNOW IT WAS ALL ON THIS SHIP 
AND WE ALL HAD TO ROCK YOU SEE WE ALL HAD TO 
THE ENTIRE CAST HAD TO ROCK AS THOUGH THEY WERE ON A BOAT 
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL RIGHT IF WE'D ALL BEEN DOING THIS 
BUT A LOT OF THEM WERE GOING THE OTHER WAY 
AS THOUGH THEY WERE ON DIFFERENT SHIPS SO IT WAS A MESS 
AND THEN WE HAD TO LOWER A BOAT INTO THE AUDITORIUM 
WHICH WE'D ALWAYS REHEARSED IN AN EMPTY THEATRE 
WE'D NEVER THOUGHT OF AN AUDIENCE BEING THERE 
AND THE NIGHT WE DID LOWER IT HALF THE SAILORS FELL ON TO 
RATHER RITZY PEOPLE IN THE FRONT ROW WITH ERMINE AND FURS 
AND ONE SAILOR SAT ON A WOMAN'S LAP INADVERTENTLY FELL RIGHT FROM THE FLOATS ON TO HER LAP 
AND SQUASHED ALL HER BLACK MAGIC I MUSTN'T SAY THAT IT'S AN ADVERTISEMENT 
ALL HER CHOCOLATES ANYWAY 
AND SHE MADE THIS FRIGHTFUL SCENE OH GET AWF GET AWF 
AND WE WERE ALL SHOUTING SHE BLOWS SHE BLOWS A GREAT SPOUT SHE BLOWS 
NO GET AWF ME 
THE WHOLE THING WAS A TERRIBLE HIATUS 
MR. WILLIAMS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED

WAIT A MINUTE WHO ARE YOU THE EDGEHOGS CALL ME JUNGLE JIM 
BUT IT ALSO UPSET HANCOCK DIDN'T IT IT UPSET HIM TERRIBLY 
COS HE SAID I DON'T WANT YOU COMING ON HERE HALFWAY THROUGH THE SHOW 
GETTING ENORMOUS ROUNDS OF APPLAUSE AND DESTROYING THE PATTERN OF THE SHOW 
WHICH SHOULD PROCEED HE SAID LIKE A REAL NARRATIVE 
YOU DON'T MIND MY COMING IN DO YOU

I'LL JUST PUT MY PHOTOS UP ON THE DRESSER 
I ALWAYS PUT MY PHOTOS UP IT STOPS ME FEELING LONELY 
BUT THEY'RE ALL OF YOU YES I AVEN'T GOT ANYBODY ELSE 
HOW SAD I KNOW 
HE WAS EXTRAORDINARILY DEPRESSIVE AND I REMEMBER SEEING HIM IN HOSPITAL 
AND HE HAD LEIBNIZ BERTRAND RUSSELL'S OUTLINE OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY 
I MEAN SUCH A COLLECTION OF ERUDITE BOOKS AND I SAID WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT 
AND HE SAID I'M TRYING TO WORK IT OUT KENNY WHAT IF 
I ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS 
WHAT IF THERE'S NO ONE UP THERE WHAT IF IT'S ALL A JOKE 
AND I SAID WELL IF IT IS LET'S MAKE IT A GOOD ONE COS I COULDN'T THINK OF WHAT ELSE TO SAY 
BUT HE SAID NO THAT'S EVADING THE ISSUE 
I WAS HERE FIRST 
OH GO ON LET ME HAVE THAT BED 
NO GO ON NO 
GO ON NO 
GO ON NO GO ON 
YOU CAN'T TOUCH ME FEET OFF THE GROUND 
HE DIDN'T LIKE MY KIND OF COMEDY SAID IT'S CARDBOARDY AND STEREOTYPED 
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT I DON'T MIND 
I SAID WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT I'LL GO 
AND I JOINED KENNETH HORNE AND I DID 
IT WAS FIRST OF ALL BEYOND OUR KEN 
AND THAT WAS ERIC MERRIMAN AND BARRY TOOK 
AND THEN IT BECAME ROUND THE HORNE 
OH HELLO I'M JULIAN AND THIS IS MY FRIEND SAND 
OH MR. HORNE HOW BONA TO VADA YOUR DOLLY OLD EEK AGAIN 
OH THANK YOU BUT WHY ARE YOU HIDING IT'S NOT LIKE YOU TWO TO BE SHY

WONDERFUL ROUND THE HORNE CHARACTERS JULE AND SAND WRITTEN BY BARRY TOOK WEREN'T THEY 
THAT WAS A CLEVER IDEA WASN'T IT COS I SAID YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THIS'LL BE POPULAR 
THEY SAID YES IT'LL GROW KEN GIVE IT A CHANCE COS WE'RE GOING TO SAY 
ALL RIGHT HITHERTO IT'S BEEN REGARDED AS ESOTERIC TO GO INTO A WHOLE LOAD OF JARGON 
BUT WE'LL MAKE THESE TWO OUTRAGEOUS CHARACTERS 
OH HE'S A DAB HAND AT THE POLARI YOU HAD THAT PARTNERSHIP DIDN'T YOU

BIG OMI A FISHERMAN DON'T OOH SWARTHY HE WAS 
AIRY AND WITH THE GREAT GOLD EARRINGS HE USED TO TAKE YOU OUT DIDN'T HE 
YES WE USED TO GO SARDINE FISHING OF A NIGHT 
M. M. M. IN HIS SMACK YOU HAD THE SMACK YES FISHING SMACK 
WELL IT MADE SENSE IN A SENSE BECAUSE IT WAS REVERSED REALLY 
ECAF WAS FACE BACKWARDS HAIR WAS RIAH 
IT WAS JUST BACKWARDS WORDS SO THAT YOU COULD SPEAK IN PUBLIC IN A PUB OR WHATEVER 
IN PRIVATE CODE WITHOUT EVERYONE KNOWING WHAT YOU WERE SAYING 
DOLLY ECAF WAS NICE FACE AND IF IT WAS A ROTTEN FACE NAFF ECAF 
AND NOBODY KNEW YOU WERE INSULTING THEM 
PORTUGAL THE ALGARVE ALBUFEIRA AND WE OPENED A NICE LITTLE GUESTHOUSE 
GUESTHOUSE BONA LATTY BONA LATTY IT'S A REGULAR OMI FROM OMI 
I BEG YOUR PARDON IT'S FOUND ITS WAY INTO THE ADDENDA 
THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY AND IT'S DEFINED THERE AS THAT WHICH IS FUNDAMENTALLY FRIVOLOUS 
AND I SUPPOSE THAT'S ABOUT THE NEAREST YOU'D GET TO AN ACADEMIC DEFINITION OF IT 
WHAT I THINK THE GENERAL YOU KNOW CURRENT INTERPRETATION OF THE WORD IS 
IS ALWAYS THAT WHICH IS VERGING ON THE EFFEMINATE YOU KNOW THAT SORT OF THING 
WHICH IS LUDICROUS TO SAY ABOUT ME 
BECAUSE I'VE PERSONIFIED WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL THE BUTCH ELEMENT IN LIGHT ENTERTAINMENT 
FOR SOME TIME NOW 
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU GET INTO LINE UP THERE WILL YA 
PLATOON 
THE FILM PRODUCER PETER ROGERS AND HIS DIRECTOR GERALD THOMAS 
LIKED MY WORK AND WERE OFFERING ME A PART IN THEIR LATEST PICTURE 
IT'S CALLED CARRY ON SERGEANT 
IS IT A GOOD PART I ASKED 
WELL IT'S A SORT OF TOFFEE NOSED INTELLECTUAL WHO RESENTS AUTHORITY 
OH THAT DOES SOUND RATHER ME DOESN'T IT 
WHO ARE YOU JAMES BAILEY B. S. C. ECONOMICS 
YOUR NUMBER I'M NOT PROUD OF IT IT WAS GIVEN TO ME I EARNED MY DEGREE 
YOUR RANK WELL THAT'S A MATTER OF OPINION 
LOOK AT THIS MAN YOU'VE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF 
LOOK AT THE SUIT THEY'VE GIVEN ME LOOK AT THIS PLUMPED ON MY HEAD WITHOUT EVEN THE PRETENCE OF FITTING 
I'D SAY THEY DO STRIKE A NOTE OF WHAT I CALL HONEST VULGARITY 
COS YOU CAN'T SAY THERE'S ANYTHING SUBTLE ABOUT THEM 
THEY'RE JUST TOTALLY FORWARD VULGARITY LIKE THE MCGILL POSTCARD 
EXACTLY WHAT I HAD IN MIND I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY'RE A KIND OF MOVING SAUCY SEASIDE POSTCARD 
YES AND I THINK THE YARDSTICK REALLY RUNS RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH ENGLISH COMEDY 
IF YOU ANALYSE IT BECAUSE SHAKESPEARE HAS AS MANY QUITE VULGAR REFERENCES 
TWELFTH NIGHT THE LETTER SCENE THAT'S PRETTY RUDE 
AND SO HAS CHAUCER SO IT RUNS RIGHT THROUGH THE MAINSTREAM IN ACTUAL FACT OF ENGLISH LITERATURE 
A GENUINE LOVE OF THE VULGAR THE HONESTLY VULGAR 
ARE MY SENSES DESERTING ME THERE'S SOMETHING FUNNY GOING ON HERE 
BILIUS I. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR THING 
SORRY SIR BUT FOR THE GOOD OF ROME YOU MUST DIE 
BUT YOU'RE MY BODYGUARD AND CHAMPION GLADIATOR I DON'T WANT TO DIE 
I MAY NOT BE A GOOD LIVE EMPEROR BUT I'D BE A WORSE ONE DEAD 
TREACHERY INFAMY INFAMY THEY'VE ALL GOT IT IN FOR ME 
IT WAS A LOT OF FUN COS PEOPLE LIKE HATTIE JACQUES JOANNIE SIMS CHARLIE HAWTREY 
I REMEMBER ON THE SET WITH CHARLIE ONCE 
HIS MOTHER ALWAYS CAME WITH HIM SHE WAS ABOUT EIGHTY 
AND SHE WAS SITTING THERE WITH A FAG AND IT DROPPED INTO THE HANDBAG 
AND THE WHOLE THING BEGAN TO SMOULDER 
JOANNIE SAID CHARLIE YOUR MOTHER'S BAG CHARLIE 
AND CHARLIE HAD A CUP OF TEA AND HE SAID OH YES AND HE FLUNG THE TEA INTO IT 
DO YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR GLASSES ON WHY 
YOU DON'T LOOK PRETTY ENOUGH 
WELL REALLY YOU'RE NO BRIGITTE BARDOT EITHER 
THERE'S NO NEED TO SHOUT 
AND THERE'S NO NEED TO MAKE PERSONAL REMARKS 
I BEG YOUR PARDON AGATHA 
CAN I HELP YOU LADIES 
IS ECCENTRIC A DESCRIPTION THAT YOU'D BALK AT OR THAT YOU'D ACCEPT 
YES I BALK AT IT I'M NOT AN ECCENTRIC 
WHEN I HEAR ABOUT REAL ECCENTRICS THE EXTRAORDINARY CLASSIC EXAMPLES OF ECCENTRICITY 
WHETHER IT'S SPOONER OR THOSE SORT OF 
UNIVERSITIES ALWAYS SEEM TO HARBOUR THESE WEIRD PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN SOME PRIVATE WORLD 
THEN I THINK TO MYSELF WELL I'M NOTHING LIKE THAT 
I'M A VERY ORDINARY PERSON 
FROM THE LEFT REVERSING ORDER NUMBER FIVE 
FOUR THREE TWO 
ONE 
THAT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT LET'S HAVE IT AGAIN IN REVERSE ORDER NUMBER FIVE 
FOUR THREE TWO 
ONE 
ARE YOU ONE OOH YES ARE YOU ONE TOO 
BECAUSE OF THE ROLES YOU PLAY YOU ARE IN A SENSE 
EXPECTED TO BEHAVE ALL THE TIME LIKE SOME KIND OF OUTRAGED DOWAGER YOU KNOW 
YOU KNOW 
THAT FACE YOU SEE 
NOW THE POINT IS THAT 
I'VE HEARD YOU LET SLIP THINGS ON RADIO 
WHICH INDICATE TO ME THAT YOU'RE EXTREMELY WELL READ EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO JUST A MINUTE 
THIS IS A GAME IN WHICH FOUR PANELLISTS TRY TO SPEAK FOR JUST A MINUTE IF THEY CAN 
AND THEY HAVE TO DO THAT WITHOUT HESITATION REPETITION OR DEVIATING FROM THE SUBJECT 
KENNETH WILLIAMS YOU'VE CHALLENGED WHY 
OH I'M SO BORED 
ALL HER BORING GOLD AND FUR WHAT A LOAD OF RUBBISH 
WE KNOW IT'S ALL LIES DEVIATION 
I AGREE KENNETH YOU HAVE FORTY FOUR SECONDS ON COMPOSITION STARTING NOW 
I EXCELLED AT THIS AT SCHOOL AND WROTE SOME REMARKABLE PIECES 
WHICH WERE GIVEN THEIR DUE PRAISE I THINK THAT'S SAFE TO SAY 
AND ONE LOVELY QUATRAIN RAN DARK NIGHT WITH HIDDEN SKY NO FRIEND 
WHEN I DRAW NIGH TO GREET ME NO MOON TO SHINE 
OH I CAN'T DO THAT COS I'VE SAID NO TWICE BUT IT'S A PITY REALLY COS IT'S A VERY NICE PIECE 
I THINK YOU'D HAVE LIKED IT OH SHE'S GOT IT'S GOT ER GOING YEAH 
FORTY FOUR SECONDS ARE LEFT ON DOGS 
WITH YOU DEREK STARTING NOW 
WHAT I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE ARE LAVATORIES FOR DOGS I HATE WALKING ALONG 
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS IT'S A FAMILY SHOW 
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT DOGS IN LOOS I THINK IT'S A DISGRACE 
I SHOULD HAVE THE SUBJECT BACK DEVIATION 
I SHOULD BE THE CHAIRMAN AS WELL YOU KNOW 
BECAUSE IT WANTS MOVING ON DOESN'T IT 
IF YOU WERE THE CHAIRMAN THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ANYBODY ELSE SPEAK 
NO IT'D BE LOVELY IT'D BE ONE MAN YES 
MY FINAL GUEST IS A MAN OF MANY TALENTS AND MULTITUDINOUS WHIMS 
JULIAN AND SANDY FANNY HADDOCK DAPHNE WHITETHIGH 
RAMBLING SYD RUMPO AND J. PEASMOLD GRUNTFUTTOCK 
SO DON'T BOOK WITTGENSTEIN IF YOU CAN GET KENNETH WILLIAMS 
THANK YOU MAY I SAY WHAT A GREAT HONOUR IT IS 
ANG ON I AVEN'T FINISHED YET 
MAY I SAY WHAT A GREAT HONOUR IT IS FOR YOU TO HAVE ME 
YOU JUST BROKE THE RECORD KENNETH 
AS YOU SAID YOURSELF ON THIS SHOW YOU JUST ANSWERED A QUESTION LONGER THAN ANYBODY ELSE 
HE SAID ON THE OPENING NIGHT HE ACTUALLY SAID 
OH I CAN'T SAY IT CAN I IT'S SO RUDE TRY IT 
WELL HE SAID PISS OFF YOU SEE 
AND SO THE RICH PAGEANT OF HIS LIFE COMES UP TO DATE 
WITTY SOPHISTICATED BRILLIANT LOVABLE 
THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN SAID ABOUT KENNETH WILLIAMS 
JOE YEAH 
JOE HE WAS A YOUNG CORDWANGLER 
MONGING GREEBLES DID HE GO 
AND HE LOVED A BOGLER'S DAUGHTER 
BY THE NAME OF CHISWICK FLO 
VAIN SHE WAS AND LIKE A GRUSSET 
THOUGH HER GANDERPARTS WERE FINE 
BUT SHE SNEERED AT HIS CORDWANGLE 
AS IT HUNG UPON THE LINE 
OH THEY HUNG HIM BY THE POSTERN 
NAILED HIS MOULIE TO THE FENCE 
FOR FOR 
FOR TO WARN ALL YOUNG CORDWANGLERS 
THAT IT WAS A GRAVE OFFENCE 
THERE'S A MORAL TO THIS STORY 
THOUGH YOUR CORDWANGLE BE POOR 
KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF OTHER'S MOULIES 
FOR IT IS AGAINST THE LAW 
THEY SHOVED ME IN THIS HOSPITAL AND THEY GAVE ME THIS BARIUM THING YOU KNOW A TUBE 
AND THEY PUT A TUBE UP THE REAR 
AND THEN THEY SHOVE ALL THIS LOTION OR WHATEVER IT IS UP 
AND PHOTOGRAPH ITS PROGRESS THROUGH YOUR 
THROUGH YOUR INNARDS 
AND I WAS WINCING ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION 
AND EVENTUALLY THIS MAN WHO'S YOU KNOW A DOCTOR 
WHO'S CONDUCTING IT ALL KEPT SAYING HOLD IT IN HOLD IT IN 
AND THIS IS VERY VALUABLE EQUIPMENT 
AND I WAS SITTING ON A LENS APPARENTLY OF SOME SORT IT WAS A CAMERA 
AND HE SAID EVENTUALLY MR. WILLIAMS YOU HAVE A SPASTIC COLON 
AS THOUGH I'D COME INTO MONEY 
BUT IT'S FRIGHTENING TO THINK THAT WITH MODERN MEDICINE 
AND ALL THE TECHNIQUE AVAILABLE TO THEM THEY CAN'T REALLY HELP YOU 
I SHOULD THINK IN THE OLD DAYS YOU WERE BETTER OFF BECAUSE NOWADAYS THEY'RE ALL SPECIALISTS 
EVERYONE'S BECOMING BETTER AND BETTER 
AT LESS AND LESS 
THEN EVENTUALLY SOMEONE'S GOING TO BE SUPERB 
AT NOTHING 
YOU ARE THINKING OF PREPARED FOR PASSING ON 
OH YES I QUITE LOOK FORWARD TO DEATH QUITE LOOK FORWARD TO DEATH 
HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF YOUR EPITAPH 
NO BUT IT'D HAVE TO BE AS FUNNY AS DOROTHY PARKER 
WHEN THEY SAID WHAT DO YOU WANT ON YOUR TOMBSTONE SHE SAID THIS ONE'S ON ME 
IT'D HAVE TO BE AS GOOD AS THAT 
AND THE FINAL CHOICE OF RECORD 
IT'S APPROPRIATE BECAUSE I DID MENTION MY LOVE OF BRAHMS 
IT'S THE MELANCHOLY IN ME THE NORSE MELANCHOLY 
WENN ICH MIT MENSCHEN UND MIT ENGELSZUNGEN REDETE BY BRAHMS 
THE COMEDY ACTOR KENNETH WILLIAMS HAS DIED AT THE AGE OF SIXTY TWO 
HE WAS FOUND DEAD AT HIS FLAT IN NORTH LONDON THIS MORNING 
WENN ICH MIT MENSCHEN UND MIT ENGELSZUNGEN REDETE BY BRAHMS 
WELL SO MUCH FOR THE KENNETH WILLIAMS STORY 
I'M ALL RIGHT REALLY JUST IN CASE MY FANS ARE WORRIED 
PERFORMING IS MAKING AN ACT OF FAITH 
BELIEVING THAT YOU CAN CREATE RECIPROCITY BETWEEN THE AUDITORIUM AND THE STAGE 
AND THAT'S WHY WHEN THE ATHEIST SAYS WHAT IF LIFE'S POINTLESS WHAT IF IT'S ALL A JOKE 
IT HAS TO BE ANSWERED BY THE COMEDIAN 
WELL IF IT IS A JOKE LET'S MAKE IT A GOOD ONE 
KISS ME MY SWEET 
AND THEN LET US PART 
AND THEN LET US PART 
AND WHEN I GROW TOO OLD TO DREAM 
THAT KISS WILL LIVE IN MY HEART 
BRAVO 
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN RATHER FOND OF BOOKS
