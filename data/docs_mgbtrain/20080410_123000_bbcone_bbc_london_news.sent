FEAR IS THAT THESE ANIMALS ARE 
ACTUALLY GOING TO RETURN TO THE 
PLACE THEY WERE RESCUED FROM THE 
OWNERS OF THESE ANIMALS MADE AN 
APPEAL IN COURT THEY HAVE BEEN 
GRANTED PERMISSION TO HAVE THESE 
ANIMALS BACK AND UNDERSTANDABLY

ANIMALS WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE 
JUDGE'S DECISION

HAUL AND TO HEAR THE JUDGMENT

SOUTH WEST LONDON HAS BEEN STRUCK 
BY A TIME OF MOTH WHICH COULD MAKE 
YOU ILL IF YOU TOUCH IT THE THE 
LAVAE OF THE OAK PRESESSIONARY HAS 
BEEN FOUND IN RICHMOND AND THE 
PUBLIC ARE BEING ASKED TO REPORT 
ANY SIGHTINGS 
WE THOUGHT MOTHS WERE THE HARMLESS 
CREATURES WHICH WE PUT UP WITH THE 
SPRING AND SUMMER BUT APPARENTLY 
NOT SO THEY CAN PROVE HARMFUL TO 
OAK TREES LIKE THIS AS WELL AS 
CAUSING SOME SORT OF REACTION IN 
HUMANS THERE IS ONE PARTICULAR 
TYPE IF YOU LOOK UP THERE LAST 
YEAR THIS OAK TREE HAD A OAK 
PRESESSIONARY MOTH NEST I AM 
JOINED 
COUNCIL WHY SHOULD THEY STAY AWAY 
AND ARE THEY DIFFICULT TO SPOT 
THEY ARE DIFFICULT TO SPOT THIS 
TIME OF YEAR LATER THIS MONTH 
THEY BECOME QUITE LARGE MOTHS AND 
THEIR DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTIC IS 
THEY WALK UP AND DOWN THE TREES IF IF PEOPLE SEE THEM THEY MIGHT BE 
TEMPTED TO DEAL WITH THEM 
THEMSELVES IS THAT A GOOD IDEA 
IT'S BAD YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU 
ARE DOING THEY NEED TO BE REMOVED 
APRIL THE TREE HAS TO BE TREATED SO 
GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR LOCAL 
ENVOORPLTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND 
YOUR LOCAL COUNCIL ENVIRONMENTAL 
THANK YOU THAT IS THE ADVICE THERE 
COUP GARDEN IS ALSO INVOLVED WITH 
DEALING WITH THE MOTHS WHICH CAN 
AS WE HAVE HEARD PROVE HARMFUL TO 
TREES AND ALSO HUMANS 
LONDON'S OLYMPICS MAY BE FOURS 
YEARS OFF BUT ALREADY SOME OF THE 
BUILDINGS ARE CLEANING UP IN 
READINESS THE TOWER OF LONDON WILL 
UNDERGO A MASSIVE CONSERVATION 
PROJECT EMMA CLIMBED TO THE TOP TO 
TAKE A LOCK 
A VERY WARM WELCOME TO WHAT IS 
ARGUABLY BRITAIN'S OLDEST BITING 
SITE THIS IS THE WHITE TOWER OF 
THE TOWER OF LONDON BUILT IN THE 
ELEVENTH CENTURY IN ORDER TO BASH BACK 
THE UNRULY LONDONERS SINCE THEN IT 
HAS BEEN A PRISON HOUSING THE KING 
OF FRANCE AND IT NOW THE ROYAL 
ARMOURY IT IS IN NEED OF A GOOD 
CLEAN DAN SNOW WHAT SHALL WE DO 
WE ARE PRESERVING THIS IT'S THE 
MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE MOST 
IMPORTANT CASTLE IN BRITAIN OVER 
ONE THOUSAND YEARS OF ITS LIFE THE STONES 
HAVE BECOME WORN DOWN BY WEATHER 
EROSION AND ALSO MORE RECENTLY BY 
POLLUTION SO IT IS GETTING A GOOD 
OLD CLEAN 
THIS IS ENORMOUS 
IT IS 
BUT THERE IS NO MORE IMPORTANT SITE 
IN BRITAIN IT WILL TAKE A LONG 
TIME WE HAVE DONE ONE SIDE THE 
OTHER THREE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS 
TO MAKE SURE THIS STAYS IN THE 
ABSOLUTELY PRISTINE CONDITION AND 
REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS 
CASTLES IN THE WORLD 
THE PUBLIC 
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET INVOLVED IN 
THE RESTORATION TO TRY TO PRETTY IT 
UP A LITTLE 
ABSOLUTELY WE HAD A 
COMPETITION WHICH I GOT TO BE WE APOLOGISE FOR THE TEMPORARY LOSS 
OF SUBTITLES BIG BEN IS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS 
OLD TODAY THE FOUNDARY IN 
WHITECHAPEL IN EAST LONDON IS STILL 
OPERATING WE SENT OUR REPORTER TO 
LOOK AT THE CHANGING TIMES OF THE 
CHIMES CHIMES THE SCENE IS ALMOST TIMELESS THE 
PROCESSES USED HERE AT THE BELL 
FOUNDARY ONE OF ONLY TWO BELL 
MAKERS LEFT IF BRITAIN HAVE HARDLY 
CHANGED THIPBS THEY CAST THEIR 
BIGGEST EVER BELL ON TENTH APRIL 
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT SINCE SEVEN WEEKS LATER 
IT WAS GIVEN THE NAME BIG BEN AND 
RANG FOR THE FIRST TIME AS THE HOUR 
BELL OF THE GREAT CLOCK AT 
WESTMINSTER THE ROLE ITS HARD EVER 
SINCE IT WAS NEARLY A DIFFERENT 
STORY THOUGH THE ORIGINAL BELL 
INTENDED FOR THE POSITION WAS CAST 
IN THE NORTH EAST BUT ON TESTING 
IT CRACKED SO WHITECHAPEL STEPPED 
IN HERE IN THE FOUNDARY'S MUSEUM 
YOU CAN GET A FEEL OF JUST HOW BIG 
BIG BEN REALLY IS FROM THIS 
TEMPLATE BUT THIS ISN'T THE ONLY 
PIECE OF MEMORABILIA THEY STILL 
HAVE THE SALES LEDGER FROM ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT 
BECAUSE THIS BELL IS A RECASTING OF 
THE FIRST BELL WE GAVE CREDIT FOR 
THE METAL THAT CAME BACK FROM THE 
OLD BELL WHICH MEANT THAT ACTUALLY 
TO MAKE BIG BEN WE CHARGED FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO 
IT'S UNLIKELY ANY WILL EVER BE AS 
WELL KNOWN AS THE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE TONNES OF 
BIG BEN TIME FOR A LOOK AT THE WEATHER 
IT IS LIKE YESTERDAY DESPITE ALL 
THIS GREY SKY ABOVE ME I THINK 
MOST WILL HAVE DRY AFTERNOON A 
BIT OF SUN IS GOING TO BREAKTHROUGH 
HERE AND THERE TEMPERATURES 
SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY L. SUPPOSE 
THERE IS CHANCE OF THE ODD SHOWER 
RUNNING ALONG THE CHILTERN RIDGE ON 
THE BRIDGE ON THE BREEZE BUT 
THEY WILL DISAPPEAR A LOT OF THE 
CLOUD WILL DISAPPEAR AND CLEAR 
SKIES FOR THE VERY FIRST PART OF 
THE NIGHT BUT LATER ON THE WINDS 
WILL FRESHEN FOR A MORE SOUTHERLY 
DIRECTION AND SHOWERY RAIN WILL 
MOVE ACROSS THE LONDON AREA AND 
THAT IS THE BEGINNING OF A CHANGE 
AS WE HEAD INTO THE WEEKEND 
TEMPERATURES TONIGHT FIVE IN CENTRAL 
LONDON TWO IN THE COLDER SPOTS IN 
THE COUNTRYSIDE TOMORROW 
MIXTURE OF SUN AND APRIL SHOWERS 
SOME OF THE SHOWERS ARE LIKELY TO 
BE HEAVY AND THUNDERY AND THERE 
COULD BE SOME HAIL MIXED IN AND 
TEMPERATURES DOWN ON TODAY IT WILL 
FEEL LITTLE COLDER THAT REALLY SETS THE SCENE FOR THE WEEKEND 
THAT'S ABOUT IT FROM ME RIZ WILL 
BE HERE WITH THE MAIN PROGRAMME FOR 
TONIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON 
THE TARGETS CHANGE THE TERROR DOES NOT 
THE BLOODY HISTORY OF FORTY YEARS OF TERRORISM
