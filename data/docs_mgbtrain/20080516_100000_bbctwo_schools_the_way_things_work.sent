YOU CAN WORK IT OUT IF YOU JUST LEARN ABOUT 
THE WAY THINGS WORK 
IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW IT CAN RIDE 
OR BUMP AND JUMP GLIDE AND SLIDE 
TAKE A LITTLE LOOK INSIDE THE WAY THINGS WORK 
AND WATCH THE THINGAMABOB THAT TURNS THE KNOB 
THAT MAKES THE JIGGER JIG 
THAT TURNS THE THINGAMAJIG THAT PULLS THE TRIGGER 
THAT MAKES THE DIGGER DIG 
IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW IT CAN FLY 
WITHOUT A WING OR STRING TO TIE WITH 
YOU FIND THE SAME RULES APPLY WITH 
THE WAY THINGS WORK 
TIE HIM UP HERE FRANK 
DON'T WANT HIM WANDERING AROUND 
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROPE SO HE CAN GET TO THE WATER TROUGH 
GOOD COS NOTHING'S WORSE THAN A DEHYDRATED MAMMOTH 
ANYWAY IF HE FREES HIMSELF HE WON'T GO VERY FAR 
HOW MUCH DO YOU BET 
COME ON YOU TWO WE HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY 
BRENDA HAD AGREED TO HELP RUN THE MAMMOTH ISLAND AWNING FACTORY 
WHILST ITS OWNER WAS ON VACATION 
UNFORTUNATELY EVERYTHING WAS BEHIND SCHEDULE 
AND THERE WERE LOTS OF AWNINGS TO DELIVER 
SO SHE ASKED FRANK AND PILBEAM TO HELP 
BETTER GET THIS ONTO HIM THEN 
STEADY OLD BOY IT'S NOT HEAVY JUST A LITTLE AWKWARD 
THAT WON'T DO HE WON'T SEE PROPERLY THAT'S BETTER ISN'T IT 
AS LONG AS WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH ANY NARROW ENTRANCES 
HAVEN'T YOU TWO FORGOTTEN SOMETHING 
WHAT'S THAT THE PAPERWORK YOU NEED TO SIGN BEFORE YOU DELIVER ANYTHING 
CAN'T SEE WHY WE HAVE TO FILL IN SO MANY FORMS TO DELIVER ONE AWNING 
THEY CALL THAT MODERNISATION 
THE ELIMINATION OF INEFFICIENCY 
MORE LIKE ELIMINATION OF FORESTS 
WITH ALL THE TREES THEY CUT DOWN TO MAKE ALL THAT PAPER 
WHERE'S OUR MAMMOTH GONE HE'S RUN AWAY 
THIS CAN'T BE TRUE 
WELL I DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT 
I THOUGHT MAMMOTHS COULDN'T FLY 
I UNDERSTAND 
WHEN THE WIND BLEW THE MAMMOTH FLEW 
THE STRONG GUST OF WIND HAD TURNED THE MAMMOTH AND THE AWNING 
INTO A KITE A KITE CAN ONLY FLY WHEN THERE IS ENOUGH WIND 
AND ITS STRING HOLDS IT SO IT DEFLECTS THE WIND DOWNWARDS 
THE WIND PROVIDES THE FORCE FOR THE FLIGHT 
IT EXERTS A REACTION THAT BALANCES THE PULL OF THE STRING 
AND THE WEIGHT OF THE KITE TO SUPPORT THE KITE IN THE AIR 
WHAT HAVE YOU TWO BEEN DOING TO THAT POOR MAMMOTH 
IT'S ALL WET AND MISERABLE 
WE WERE TRYING TO DELIVER AN AWNING AND THE MAMMOTH TOOK OFF 
THEN CAME DOWN AGAIN SPLASH 
WHAT A GREAT WAY TO DELIVER THINGS 
HEY WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO THAT AWNING 
THE MAMMOTH HAD A BIT OF AN ACCIDENT 
AND IT GOT ALL WET 
THAT'S WHY IT'S SOGGY AND WARPED 
NEXT TIME MAKE SURE YOU WRAP IT UP GOOD AND TIGHT 
SO AS TO KEEP IT DRY 
BRENDA WITHOUT REALISING IT 
HAD COME UP WITH A GREAT IDEA 
IF THE AWNING WERE WRAPPED UP TOO TIGHT IT WOULD BECOME CURVED 
SO THE EXTERIOR WOULD LOOK RATHER LIKE THIS SHAPE 
WHICH WE CALL AN AEROFOIL 
WHEN FLYING THE AIR PASSING ABOVE THE WING HAS FURTHER TO TRAVEL 
THAN THE AIR PASSING BENEATH 
THIS LOWERS THE AIR PRESSURE ABOVE THE WING 
WHICH FORCES IT UPWARDS THE FORCE IS CALLED LIFT 
THAT'S GOT A BIT OF A CURVE YOU MUST HAVE WRAPPED IT TOO TIGHT 
I DIDN'T WANT IT GETTING WET AND WARPED AGAIN 
STEADY ON OLD THING 
GENTLY DOES IT 
THERE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THESE 
THAT'LL STOP YOUR EYES WATERING WHEN YOU GO FAST 
WATCH OUT HE'S TAKING OFF 
I'LL GET YOU 
OH OH MISSED 
DON'T WORRY HE'S STILL ATTACHED TO THE ROPE HE CAN'T GO FAR 
HE CAN NOW WE'LL LOSE OUR MAMMOTH 
LOOK HE'S COMING BACK 
HE'S FLYING ALL BY HIMSELF 
COME ON GOOD BOY COME BACK HERE AND HAVE A NICE SNACK 
THERE'S A GOOD BOY THEN 
THE MAMMOTH HAD FLOWN LIKE A GLIDER 
THE SIMPLEST KIND OF WINGED AIRCRAFT 
IT'S PULLED ALONG THE GROUND 
UNTIL IT'S FAST ENOUGH FOR THE LIFT GENERATED BY THE WINGS 
TO EXCEED ITS WEIGHT THE GLIDER THEN RISES INTO THE AIR 
AND FLIES AFTER RELEASE FROM ITS TOW ROPE 
IT CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD AS IT DROPS SLOWLY 
PULLED BY A THRUST FORCE DUE TO GRAVITY THE FRICTION WITH THE AIR 
PRODUCES A FORCE CALLED DRAG 
THAT HOLDS THE GLIDER BACK 
THE TWO PAIRS OF OPPOSING FORCES LIFT AND WEIGHT THRUST AND DRAG 
ACT ON ALL AIRCRAFT 
PILBEAM FRANK 
WHAT'S THAT MAMMOTH OF YOURS DOING ON MY PILE OF AWNING MATERIAL 
IT WAS AROUND THIS TIME THAT I BEGAN TO TAKE A PROFOUND INTEREST 
IN THE PROGRESS OF MAMMOTH FLIGHT AND THE ISLANDERS' APPROACH TO IT 
COME ON YOU CAN DO IT JUST GIVE IT ANOTHER TRY 
NOW THAT YOU'RE RESTED WE'LL SOON HAVE YOU AIRBORNE 
O. K. TROY IT'S TIME TO PEDAL 
HOWEVER FAST THE MAMMOTH RAN 
HE COULDN'T TAKE OFF SO 
YOU'D BETTER HAVE THESE YOU DESERVE THEM 
EVERYONE DECIDED THAT THE BEST WAY FOR THE MAMMOTH TO GET AIRBORNE 
MUST BE TO GIVE IT WHEELS AND USE SOME ONBOARD PROPULSION 
WITH THE SKATES HE'LL ZOOM DOWN THE RUNWAY ARE YOU GOING TO PUSH HIM 
NO I'VE GOT A MUCH BETTER IDEA TRUNK POWER 
WHAT'S THAT I'LL SHOW YOU COME ON EVERYBODY GATHER ROUND 
NOW WHAT YOU'VE ALL GOT TO DO IS TAKE DEEP BREATHS WITH YOUR MOUTH 
AND BLOW THE AIR OUT OF YOUR NOSE AS HARD AS YOU CAN 
OLIVE ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND OR SOMETHING 
NO AUNTIE BRENDA JUST PLEASE DO AS I ASK 
TRUST ME NOW ALL WE NEED IS SOME DIRECTION 
DAD PILBEAM GET HIM TO POINT HIS TRUNK BACKWARDS 
BRILLIANT ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
IN OUT 
IN 
OUT 
IN OUT 
GOOD BOY 
KEEP IT UP 
IN 
OUT IN 
OUT 
BUT HOWEVER HARD HE TRIED 
HE COULDN'T ACCELERATE TO THE SPEED AT WHICH HE'D SOAR INTO THE AIR 
THERE WAS JUST NOT ENOUGH LIFT 
IT HAD SEEMED SUCH A BRILLIANT IDEA 
THE ISLANDERS AS EVER WOULD NOT GIVE UP THEY WERE RESOURCEFUL 
WE NEED SOMETHING THAT WILL PUSH THE MAMMOTH UP INTO THE AIR 
WE HAVEN'T MUCH TIME ALL THE DELIVERIES ARE TERRIBLY LATE 
WE'LL NEED SOMETHING STRONG AND POWERFUL 
I HAD TO STOP THEM PUTTING A HUGE JET ON THE MAMMOTH'S BACK 
COS IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS AND THE MAMMOTH COULD HAVE COME TO HARM 
AS THERE WAS NO WAY TO CONTROL HIS FLIGHT AT THAT MOMENT 
THE FACTORY OWNER RETURNED FROM HOLIDAY 
WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT THE EXPERIMENT 
HE STOPPED WORRYING ABOUT AWNING DELIVERIES 
AND WENT INTO THE AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY 
THE AIRCRAFT HE BUILT WAS CONTROLLED BY THIS CONTROL COLUMN 
AND THESE PEDALS PULL THE COLUMN BACK 
AND THE ELEVATORS ON THE TAIL DEFLECT THE AIRFLOW 
THE TAIL DROPS AND THE NOSE RISES 
SO THE AIRCRAFT CLIMBS 
CONVERSELY YOU PUSH THE COLUMN FORWARDS 
THE AIRFLOW MAKES THE TAIL RISE AND THE NOSE DROP 
AND THE AIRCRAFT DIVES PRESS THE PEDALS TO ONE SIDE 
AND THE RUDDER DEFLECTS AIRFLOW CAUSING THE AIRCRAFT TO TURN 
IT IS NECESSARY TO PUSH THE COLUMN TO THE SIDE 
TO ROLL THE AIRCRAFT SO THAT IT TURNS SMOOTHLY 
I'M SO EXCITED 
I'VE NEVER BEEN OVERSEAS BEFORE 
HOW COULD YOU AFFORD ALL THIS 
THAT KIND MAN WHO OWNED THE AWNING FACTORY GAVE THE TICKETS TO ME 
IT WAS A THANK YOU FOR SOME IDEAS WE GAVE HIM 
THAT'S NICE ONE THING'S WORRYING ME THOUGH 
WHAT'S THAT I'M MISSING OUR MAMMOTH ALREADY 
I WONDER HOW HE IS 
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU I'D STILL BE MAKING AWNINGS 
WHEN I WAKE UP EARLY IN THE MORNING 
I LIFT MY HEAD 
I'M STILL YAWNING 
WHEN I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A DREAM 
I STAY IN BED 
FLOAT UP STREAM FLOAT UP STREAM 
PLEASE DON'T WAKE ME 
NO DON'T SHAKE ME 
LEAVE ME WHERE I AM 
I'M ONLY SLEEPING 
HEY HEY HEY HEY 
EVERYBODY SEEMS TO THINK I'M LAZY 
WELL I DON'T MIND 
I THINK THEY'RE CRAZY 
RUNNING EVERYWHERE AT SUCH A SPEED 
TILL THEY FIND 
THERE'S NO N. E. E. E. ED 
THERE'S NO NEED 
PLEASE DON'T SPOIL MY DAY 
I'M MILES AWAY 
AND AFTER ALL 
I'M ONLY SLEEPING 
HEY HEY HEY HEY 
KEEPIN' AN EYE ON THE WORLD GOING BY MY WINDOW 
TAKIN' MY TIME 
LYING THERE AND STARING AT THE CEILING 
WAITING FOR 
A SLEEPY FEELING 
PLEASE DON'T SPOIL MY DAY 
I'M MILES AWAY 
AND AFTER ALL 
I'M ONLY SLEEPING 
NO NO NO 
PLEASE DON'T WAKE ME 
NO DON'T SHAKE ME 
LEAVE ME WHERE I AM 
I'M ONLY SLEEPING 
NO NO NO NO
