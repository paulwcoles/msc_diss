EVERY YEAR HUNDREDS OF BRITISH GARDENS TRY DESPERATELY TO GET A PLACE IN THE YELLOW BOOK 
THIS ANNUAL GUIDE FROM THE NATIONAL GARDENS SCHEME 
LISTS PRIVATE GARDENS JUDGED BRILLIANT ENOUGH TO OPEN FOR CHARITY 
FOR THE FEW LUCKY PEOPLE WHO ARE ACCEPTED INTO THIS BOOK 
IT MEANS THE WORLD TO SHARE THEIR GARDENS WITH THE PAYING PUBLIC BUT OUT OF EIGHT HUNDRED APPLICANTS 
ONLY HALF WILL GET THROUGH 
WITH SUCH HIGH STANDARDS OF ENTRY THE ASSESSMENT IS RUTHLESS 
I'M GOING TO SAY NO 
I'LL SAY NO FOR THIS YEAR 
I'M GOING TO SAY NO 
I'LL BE FOLLOWING AVID GARDENERS STRIVING TO TURN THEIR PRIVATE PARADISES INTO OPEN GARDENS' 
TODAY I'LL BE MEETING TWO PEOPLE WHO HOPE THEIR GARDEN IS GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE THE GRADE 
A VERY CLOSE FRIEND RECENTLY HAD BREAST CANCER I'M PUTTING BACK 
I JUST HOPE THAT THE COUNTY ORGANISER LIKED WHAT I'VE DONE I A. M. NERVOUS YES 
WILL TODAY'S GARDENS HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO GET ACCEPTED INTO THE PRESTIGIOUS YELLOW BOOK 
OUR FIRST GARDEN IS LITTLECOURT COTTAGES IN DEVON 
HIDDEN AWAY BEHIND ELEGANT SEASIDE VILLAS IS THIS TOTALLY UNEXPECTED OASIS OF CALM 
IT'S ALMOST A BOTANIC GARDEN 
PACKED FULL OF RARE TREASURES FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD 
IT BELONGS TO GEOFFREY WARD AND SELWYN KUSSMAN WHO LIVE IN SIDMOUTH ON THE DEVON COAST 
IT'S TAKEN NINE YEARS OF HARD GRAFT TO GET THE GARDEN UP TO STANDARD 
IT MEANS AN AWFUL LOT TO ME 
I LOOK ON IT AS ANOTHER ROOM OF THE HOUSE 
I ENJOY THE CREATING AND REDESIGNING DIFFERENT AREAS 
IT'S THREE QUARTERS OF AN ACRE WRAPPED AROUND THEIR HOUSE AND HOLIDAY COTTAGES 
IT INCLUDES A COTTAGE GARDEN WATER FEATURE PATIO AREA 
ITALIANATE AREA AND A FORMAL GARDEN IN THE FRONT 
GETTING INTO THE YELLOW BOOK WOULD MEAN THE WORLD TO GEOFFREY I WOULD BE REALLY PLEASED 
I'D BE ABLE TO OPEN IT TO THE PUBLIC TO HELP RAISE MONEY FOR THEM 
AND PEOPLE COULD ENJOY WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED HERE 
CHARITY IS CRUCIAL TO GEOFFREY'S DRIVE TO TRY TO OPEN 
MOST OF THE MONEY THAT'S RAISED GOES TO CANCER CHARITIES 
I'VE GOT A VERY CLOSE FRIEND THAT'S RECENTLY HAD BREAST CANCER 
I THINK I'D LIKE TO PUT SOMETHING BACK 
FOR THE HELP SHE'S RECEIVED IT'LL BE A NICE WAY TO RAISE MONEY 
SELWYN KNOWS WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO GET ACCEPTED IT WOULD MEAN EVERYTHING TO GEOFFREY TO GET IN 
HE'S WORKED HARD AT THE GARDEN AND WE FEEL IT'S UP TO STANDARD 
IT WOULD BE NICE TO SHARE IT GEOFFREY AND SELWYN THOUGH HAVE GRAND DESIGNS FOR THE GARDEN 
WHAT ARE THE MOST AMBITIOUS PROJECTS YOU'VE GOT 
WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF IDEAS WE'D LIKE TO DEVELOP 
MOVE A FEW TREES ERECT A SUMMER HOUSE AND REDEVELOP A CORNER OF IT 
YOU'RE SERIOUS AND TURN FIFTY L. B. OF FLOUR INTO BISCUITS 
YOU TEASE 
WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO OPEN FOR THE NATIONAL GARDENS SCHEME 
THE FACT THAT IT'S FOR CHARITY WHICH IS A BIG THING 
WE'VE GOT A FRIEND GOING THROUGH TREATMENT FO R. C. A. N. C. E. R. 
AND THE MONEY THAT WILL BE RAISED WILL BE A FANTASTIC THING 
AND FOR PEOPLE TO COME AND ENJOY THE GARDEN AND GET IDEAS 
WITH THE ASSESSMENT JUST DAYS AWAY THERE ARE A FEW POTENTIAL HURDLES' 
THEY HAVE AMBITIOUS PLANS TO COMPLETELY REVOLUTIONISE THIS AREA UNDER THE TREE 
BUT IS THE COUNTY ORGANISER GOING TO BE CONVINCED THAT THEY CAN ACHIEVE THIS IN TIME FOR THE OPENING 
THE PERSON THEY'LL HAVE TO CONVINCE IS ASSISTANT COUNTY ORGANISER FOR DEVON JO HINDS 
JUDGING BY HER GARDEN UNFINISHED PROJECTS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED 
WATER IN A GARDEN I THINK IS REALLY GOOD IT'S A PERFECT THING TO HAVE IN A GARDEN 
ALL GARDENS HAVE TO BE AWARE OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY ASPECTS OF HAVING THE PUBLIC AROUND 
CERTAINLY SOME GARDENS MIGHT BE TURNED DOWN ON THE BASIS OF DANGER WITHIN THE GARDEN 
OUR SECOND GARDEN BELONGS TO ANDREA AND JOHN CLOUSE IN WALES 
LOOKING OUT ACROSS THE VALE OF GLAMORGAN IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS CIVILISED GARDEN 
HAS ONLY BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR THREE YEARS ANDREA AND JOHN HAVE HAD PLENTY OF PROBLEMS 
STRONG BITING WINDS AND STONY SOILS AND THE GARDEN WAS COVERED IN BRAMBLES 
BUT THEY'VE MANAGED TO CREATE THIS BEAUTIFUL GARDEN 
USING THIS GENTLE SLOPE TO MAKE A GARDEN OF TWO HALVES UP HERE IT'S FORMAL BUT VERY WINDY 
JUST TO GET A START GET THE CHORES DONE AND THEN BACK OUT AGAIN AFTERWARDS 
THIS EXPOSED GARDEN IS SURROUNDED BY A STONE WALL SOURCED FROM ITS OWN SOIL 
THE CENTRAL GRAVEL PATH LEADS YOU THROUGH THE LAWN WITH HERBACEOUS BORDERS TO THE MORE SHELTERED AREA 
HAVING ENJOYED GETTING THE GARDEN READY FOR TWO WEDDINGS IN THE PAST 
ANDREA LIKES NOTHING BETTER THAN WORKING TO A DEADLINE 
GETTING INTO THE YELLOW BOOK REALLY WAS SOMETHING THAT 
WE THOUGHT ABOUT AFTER WE'D FINISHED WITH ALL THE WEDDINGS 
WE THOUGHT WE WON'T HAVE A DATE ANY MORE TO HAVE THE GARDEN READY 
THE YELLOW BOOK SEEMED TO BE A REALLY GOOD WAY OF WORKING REALLY HARD FOR A PARTICULAR DATE 
AND GETTING IT AS GOOD AS YOU COULD GET IT AND THEN BEING ABLE TO ENJOY THE FRUITS OF YOUR LABOUR 
JOHN RECOGNISES JUST HOW IMPORTANT GARDENING HAS BEEN TO ANDREA 
SADLY ANDREA'S MOTHER PASSED AWAY LAST YEAR AND SHE PROBABLY FOUND THE GARDEN FAIRLY THERAPEUTIC 
SHE'S ALWAYS GOT A PROJECT ALWAYS WANTS TO DO THINGS' 
SHE THROWS HERSELF INTO THINGS AND GETTING INVOLVED WITH THIS HAS BEEN GREAT FOR HER FOR US BOTH 
THE GARDEN HASN'T BEEN EASY FOR ANDREA 
SO WHAT PROBLEMS SPECIFICALLY DO YOU ENCOUNTER IN THIS GARDEN 
THE ROCK IN THE GROUND 
THERE'S A LOT OF IT AND THEY ARE VERY BIG PIECES 
ALL THESE WALLS WERE BUILT FROM WHAT WE'VE DUG UP THERE'S STILL A LOT MORE IN THERE 
BUT THE WIND BURNS A LOT OF THE PLANTS 
SOME OF THEM DON'T LIKE IT YOU HAVE TO DO A BIT OF TRIAL AND ERROR 
IT'S A MATTER OF EXPERIMENT IT IS YES 
WHAT DO YOU LOVE ABOUT IT 
I LOVE THE VIEW AND I LOVE WHEN I'M IN IT I FEEL AS IF I'M ON THE EDGE OF THE COUNTRYSIDE 
SOME PEOPLE FIND THEIR GARDENS VERY THERAPEUTIC IS YOURS FOR YOU 
MY MOTHER DIED LAST YEAR 
JUST WORKING PEACEFULLY 
I COULD JUST BE HERE QUIETLY LOVELY 
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU WEREN'T ACCEPTED VERY DISAPPOINTED 
BECAUSE I THINK SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED IN THREE YEARS OTHER PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE WHEN WE CAME 
IT WILL BE JUDGED ON WHAT'S HERE YES I REALISE THAT 
WITH THE ASSESSMENT JUST AROUND THE CORNER IT WON'T BE PLAIN SAILING 
THE HOUSE MAY LOOK AS THOUGH IT'S BEEN HERE FOREVER BUT THEY'RE STILL STRUGGLING WITH THE GARDEN 
ITS EXPOSED SITE AND STONY SOIL REALLY CREATE A LOT OF PROBLEMS 
BUT THEY'VE GOT THEIR HEART SET ON BEING INCLUDED IN THE YELLOW BOOK 
COULD THE IMPACT OF THE ELEMENTS PUT PAID TO THEIR PLANS 
THE COUNTY ORGANISER FOR GLAMORGAN AND THE PERSON THEY HAVE TO PERSUADE IS ROSAMUND DAVIES 
WHOSE OWN GARDEN SHOWS HOW HIGH THE STANDARDS WILL BE 
IF THE GARDEN OWNER HAS LOTS OF PLANS AND SAYS I'M GOING TO PUT TWO THOUSAND TREES IN THERE 
DIG A LAKE OVER THERE I'D SAY PLEASE CAN WE COME BACK IN TWO YEARS' TIME 
I'M SURE IT WILL BE WONDERFUL BUT YOU NEED TIME TO DEVELOP IT 
OTHERWISE PEOPLE WOULD BE VISITING THAT GARDEN AND IT'S NOT READY 
WILL OUR TWO GARDENS BE GOOD ENOUGH TODAY IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO FACE THE ULTIMATE TEST 
ROSAMUND DAVIES IS ON HER WAY TO HILLCOT HOUSE IN GLAMORGAN 
HELLO ROSAMUND DAVIES HELLO HOW NICE TO MEET YOU 
BUT WILL THE GARDEN'S MANY PROBLEMS STOP ANDREA AND JOHN FROM GETTING INTO THE YELLOW BOOK 
IN DEVON JO HINDS HAS ARRIVED IN SIDMOUTH HIYA I'M JO HINDS NATIONAL GARDENS SCHEME 
MORNING I'M GEOFFREY 
BUT WILL THEIR GRAND PLANS BE VIEWED AS TOO MUCH 
IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT TO DO UNDER DRY SHADE THAT'S RIGHT YEAH 
I'M HOPING WE'LL HAVE SOME IDEAS FOR A NEW PROJECT 
SO HOW REALISTIC WOULD BE THE DEADLINE OF JUNE 
WE SHOULD DEFINITELY GET IT READY 
GEOFFREY'S FIRST OF MANY PROJECTS HAS ALREADY GOT JO CONCERNED 
IN GLAMORGAN IT ISN'T THE STUNNING VIEW THAT HITS ROSAMUND FIRST 
OH GOODNESS THE WIND 
I KNOW 
WHAT A WONDERFUL VIEW IT JUST GOES ON AND ON IT DOES 
ON A LESS WINDY DAY THIS IS OUR PROBLEM 
THERE'S NOT MUCH HAPPENING YOU'RE THINKING OF DIGGING THIS UP AND STARTING OVER AGAIN 
ROSAMUND'S PICKED UP ON ANDREA'S DIFFICULTY IN FINDING PLANTS THAT CAN COPE WITH HIGH EXPOSURE 
HOW WILL THIS AFFECT HER CHANCES 
IN DEVON JO'S ARRIVED AT THE NEXT PROJECT 
THIS IS THE COURTYARD AREA 
AND EVENTUALLY OR SOON WE'RE GOING TO BE GETTING A NEW SUMMER HOUSE WHEN 
HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT THREE WEEKS SO YOU'VE GOT QUITE A LOT OF WORK 
THE PROJECT IN THE FRONT GARDEN AND A SUMMER HOUSE GOING UP 
ERECTING THE NEW SUMMER HOUSE IS A HUGE PROJECT NOT SURPRISINGLY JO'S PERTURBED 
IN GLAMORGAN ANDREA AND ROSAMUND REACH THE MORE SHELTERED AREA 
SO WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE THIS IS OUR LITTLE COFFEE GARDEN WE GET THE MORNING SUN 
ANYTHING STRONGER ABSOLUTELY OVER HERE IS THE GIN AND TONIC CORNER IN THE EVENING SUN 
YOU'VE STILL GOT THIS FANTASTIC VIEW ROSAMUND'S STILL IMPRESSED 
BUT IN DEVON GEOFFREY'S MENTIONING YET ANOTHER PROJECT 
WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO MOVE THIS TREE 
AND USE IT IN THE FRONT GARDEN YOU'RE DOING THAT AS WELL 
IT LOOKS LIKE MOVING THE TREE COULD BE THE LAST STRAW 
YOU HAVE GOT QUITE A LOT OF WORK 
BOTH GARDENS HAVE BEEN ASSESSED NOW IT'S THE MOMENT OF TRUTH 
WELL IT'S A REALLY LOVELY GARDEN 
I'M A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THE QUANTITY OF PROJECTS ON THE GO 
THANK YOU SO MUCH I HAVE ENJOYED YOUR GARDEN 
IT'S A SURPRISE COMING FROM THE BACK TO THE FRONT 
A WONDERFUL VIEW OVER THE VALE OF GLAMORGAN IT JUST GOES ON FOREVER 
VISITORS WOULD LIKE THAT SURPRISE 
WE'VE GOT MOVING A TREE PUTTING UP A SUMMER HOUSE A LOT OF WORK 
YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE WORK UNDERWAY WHEN YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE COMING TO SEE THE GARDEN 
IT'S GREAT FUN WHEN IT DIPS DOWN TO THE TWO LOVELY GARDENS YOU'VE GOT AT THE BOTTOM 
YOUR TEA GARDEN AND YOUR GIN GIN AND TONIC GARDEN GREAT 
WAS IT A PROJECT TOO FAR FOR GEOFFREY AND SELWYN 
ACTUALLY IT'S A REALLY LOVELY GARDEN AND THANK YOU 
UNUSUAL WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU IN THE GARDENS SCHEME FANTASTIC 
THANK YOU I AM REALLY PLEASED I LOOK FORWARD TO OPENING IT THANK YOU 
GREAT NOW WE CAN GET ALL THOSE JOBS DONE 
THEY'RE IN AND IN A FEW MONTHS' TIME THIS STUNNINGLY EXOTIC COASTAL GARDEN WILL OPEN FOR THE PUBLIC 
WILL THEY GET EVERYTHING DONE IN TIME IT'S A REAL ACHIEVEMENT 
THAT SOMEBODY OF THAT STANDARD HAS COME ALONG ACCEPTED WHAT WE'VE GOT 
AND ALSO WILL GIVE US A LOT OF INSPIRATION TO DO MORE 
SO THAT PEOPLE CAN HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE GOT 
AT HILLCOT HOUSE IN GLAMORGAN ROSAMUND LOVED THE VIEWS 
BUT WILL IT BE ENOUGH I DO FEEL SOME OF THE BORDERS ARE NOT QUITE MATURE ENOUGH 
I THINK IT'S NO FOR THIS YEAR 
IT'S A NO ANDREA'S GARDEN WON'T BE IN THIS YEAR'S YELLOW BOOK 
BUT THEY WILL BE BACK FOR ANOTHER ASSESSMENT IN FIVE MONTHS' TIME 
CAN SHE MAKE THE CHANGES NEEDED 
I DO QUITE LIKE WORKING TO A DATE 
IT'S THE RIGHT TIME OF YEAR TO DO IT SO I AM DETERMINED 
IT'S SIX WEEKS BEFORE GEOFFREY AND SELWYN OPEN THEIR GARDEN FOR THE N. G.S 
AND THEIR MONUMENTAL PLANS FOR THE BEECH TREE AND ERECTING A SUMMER HOUSE HAVEN'T REALLY ADVANCED 
SO ARE YOU REALLY THRILLED ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED 
WE'VE GOT THIS MASSIVE PROJECT WE'VE GOT TO GET DONE WHICH WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT AS WELL 
THIS IS THE PLAN WE'VE HAD DRAWN UP GREAT ISN'T IT TRULY BEAUTIFUL 
THERE ARE A LOT OF STEPS THERE YES BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE THAT DIFFICULT 
THE SLEEPERS ARE EASY TO PUT IN 
I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT DISTURBING THE ROOTS OF THE BEECH TREE I DON'T THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM 
IT'S ALREADY UNDER THE SLOPE 
BEECH ARE VERY SUPERFICIALLY ROOTED AND YOU'RE NOT CUTTING MUCH AWAY 
SHOW ME WHERE THESE STEPS ARE GOING TO GO YEAH SURE 
THIS WAS A MAJOR PROBLEM ARE FOR THEM 
THE SHADY BUT DRY AREA UNDER THE BEECH TREE REALLY DID LET THE REST OF THE GARDEN DOWN 
THEIR SOLUTION OF STEPS UP TO A SECLUDED AREA IS BRILLIANT BUT AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK 
I'D ALSO LIKE TO GET SOME FRAGRANT PLANTS UP HERE SO YOU'VE GOT SOME NICE PERFUME IN THE AIR 
YES PERVADING THE AIR YES 
THE PROBLEM IS USUALLY YOU ASSOCIATE SCENTED PLANTS 
WITH VERY SUNNY DRY CONDITIONS 
IT'S CERTAINLY DRY BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SUNNY 
SURE SO MAYBE SARCOCOCCA WOULD BE A GOOD ONE TO GO FOR THAT WOULD BE GREAT 
ITS SCENT WILL BE THERE IN WINTER IT'S LOVELY AND DENSE AND EVERGREEN WHEN DOES IT FLOWER CHRISTMAS ON 
FOR THREE MONTHS OR SO 
IT'S THE PERFECT CANDIDATE BUT I BET YOU HAVE ALL SORTS OF OTHERS 
IN THIS VAST COLLECTION OF PLANTS YOU'RE BOUND TO COME UP WITH ONE 
WITH GLOBAL WARMING BECOMING A REALITY THEIR GARDEN THROWS UP INTERESTING EXAMPLES 
OF PLANTS THAT WILL BECOME MUCH MORE FAMILIAR IN THE FUTURE 
THIS GARDEN IS PACKED WITH EXCITING SHRUBS LOTS FROM THE ANTIPODES 
LIKE THIS LOVELY GREVILLEA ROBUSTA THIS ONE'S CRANBERRY JAM 
YOU'D HAVE TO GROW THIS IN A NORMAL GARDEN IN A VERY SHELTERED PLACE 
IT'S PLANTS LIKE THIS THAT MORE OF US ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TURN TO 
THEY COPE WITH DROUGHTY SUMMERS AND THE SORT OF CONDITIONS WE'RE ALL LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE 
A FEW WEEKS AFTER THE MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT OF NOT BEING ACCEPTED 
AND ANDREA IS STILL UNSURE WHAT TO DO WITH HER IMMATURE BORDERS' 
WHAT DID SHE SAY ABOUT IT 
WELL IT WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE INTERESTING 
PERHAPS WHAT I WANT AND WHAT SHE THOUGHT ISN'T QUITE DOESN'T COINCIDE 
THIS BED IS A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS 
ALTHOUGH YOU'VE GOT STONY SOIL IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE WET HERE 
THE VERY PLANTS YOU WOULD EXPECT TO ENJOY LIFE ON THE HILLSIDE IN A VERY EXPOSED PLACE 
MEDITERRANEAN PLANTS AND PLANTS FROM THE SEASIDE 
THEY'RE ACTUALLY NOT HAPPY WITH THEIR FEET IN WATER 
TO USE THOSE KIND OF PLANTS YOU NEED EVEN MORE STONY 
WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF THAT YES YOU HAVE PLENTY TO BRING UP HERE 
AND THEN FINISH THE WHOLE THING OFF WITH GRAVEL YOU MIGHT LINK UP THEN WITH THE PATH THE ENTRANCE 
AND MAKE MORE CONTINUITY OF IT 
PEOPLE COME ALONG AND THEY GET SOMETHING AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT 
WITHOUT ANY SORT OF SEPARATION 
AS WELL AS REVOLUTIONISING THE SOIL 
THERE ARE A FEW PLANTS HERE LOOKING A BIT THE WORSE FOR WEAR 
NO DIG IT UP 
I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN ABOUT STONES 
SISYRINCHIUM STRIATUM IS EVERGREEN BUT ITS FOLIAGE CAN GET SCORCHED BY SEARING WINDS 
DIG IT UP SHAKE OFF THE SOIL AND PULL IT INTO SEPARATE CLUMPS 
IF ANY OF THE OUTSIDE FOLIAGE LOOKS SHODDY JUST PULL IT OFF 
THAT WAY ONE PLANT CAN YIELD ABOUT TWENTY 
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT MOVE IT TO A SHELTERED POSITION IF YOU HAVE ONE 
IF YOU MOVE THESE SOMEWHERE ELSE WITH A BIT MORE SHELTER AND REPLACE THEM WITH LAVENDER LOVELY 
ONCE YOU'VE PUT THE GRAVEL IN 
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE PERFUME TO GREET YOUR VISITORS AS THEY COME 
LET'S HOPE WHEN IT'S DONE YOU MIGHT GET SOME YES 
AT GEOFFREY'S GARDEN IN SIDMOUTH THERE'S LESS THAN TWO MONTHS TO GO 
HE'S ALREADY HAD A PRETTY GOOD GO AT SOME OF HIS BIG PROJECTS 
THE SUMMER HOUSE HAS BEEN ERECTED AND THE STEPS UNDER THE BEECH TREE HAVE BEEN LAID 
BUT THERE'S STILL SO MUCH TO DO 
WE'VE STILL GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO 
A LOT OF PLANTING TO DO GET ALL THE HARDCORE IN RE STAIN THE STEPS 
WE'VE GOT HANGING BASKETS TO GET READY AND RE SHAPE THE LAWN SLIGHTLY 
YOU ALWAYS WILL PANIC ON THE DAY BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS NERVOUS AND PEOPLE ARE COMING AND PAYING 
EVERY PERSON WHO COMES THROUGH THE DOOR IS GOING TO BE DONATING MONEY TOWARDS A REALLY GOOD CAUSE 
MY CAUSE BEING BREAST CANCER BECAUSE OF MY FRIEND THAT MAKES IT AN EXTRA SPECIAL DAY FOR ME 
IN GLAMORGAN IT'S THE DAY BEFORE ANDREA'S REASSESSMENT TO GET BACK INTO NEXT YEAR'S YELLOW BOOK 
SHE'S JUST COME BACK FROM SOME LAST MINUTE PLANT BUYING 
I'VE HAD TO DO A LAST MINUTE SHOP TODAY TO GET SOME PLANTS 
TO FILL IN THIS GAP BETWEEN THE OLIVE TREE AND THE ESCALLONIA 
I WANTED TO BRING SOME BLUE AND SOME WHITE INTO IT TO GO WITH THE SILVER OF THE OLIVE TREE 
I HOPE SHE WILL SEE A LOT MORE COLOUR IN THE GARDEN I'M VERY NERVOUS ABOUT TOMORROW 
IT'S NEVER QUITE RIGHT 
BUT I JUST HOPE THAT THE COUNTY ORGANISER LIKES WHAT I'VE DONE 
BUT I AM NERVOUS YES 
THE NEW BED LOOKS GREAT BUT ANDREA HASN'T TOUCHED THE PROBLEM BED NEAR THE HOUSE 
I HOPE THIS WON'T BE AN ISSUE FOR TOMORROW 
THE NEXT DAY AND THE WEATHER IS SURPRISINGLY CLEMENT COULD THIS BE A GOOD OMEN FOR ANDREA 
ALL OF HER HARD WORK HAS PAID OFF IN SPADES THE GARDEN LOOKS RESPLENDENT 
THE ONCE SCORCHED AND DESOLATE BEDS ARE BRIMMING WITH PLANT LIFE 
WHERE THERE WAS ONCE A DISTINCT LACK OF COLOUR THE WHOLE GARDEN HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED 
AND EVEN JOHN'S VEG PATCH IS MAKING ITS CONTRIBUTION 
I THOUGHT I MIGHT POP ALONG TO SEE HOW THE ASSESSMENT GOES 
IT'S ALL GROWN UP A LOT IT HAS 
I CAN'T SEE VERY MUCH OF WHAT WE DISCUSSED 
WELL TO BE HONEST I HAVEN'T 
THAT LOOKS A BIT SCRUFFY HAVE YOU GOT SOMETHING TO PUT IN ITS PLACE 
A POT THAT WON'T LOOK RIGHT THERE 
GET JOHN TO STAND THERE YES 
HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT HER VISIT NERVOUS I AM 
I HAVEN'T DONE THIS AND IT'S THE FIRST THING SHE'LL SEE YEAH 
BUT I HOPE THE OTHER PLACES MAKE UP FOR THAT FINGERS CROSSED YES 
WITH THE COUNTY ORGANISER ARRIVING AT ANY MOMENT I SIT WITH JOHN 
WHAT'S ANDREA UP TO SHE'S PUTTING A PLANT IN A CORNER THAT LOOKS A BIT ROPEY 
HELLO ANDREA HELLO ROS SOMEBODY'S BEEN WORKING HARD IN THE VEG PATCH 
THAT'S JOHN SUPER AND YOU'RE STILL WORKING ON THIS ONE I AM STILL WORKING ON IT 
I DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE SUMMER WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS 
YOUR VISITORS WILL BE COMING IN PAST YOUR GOOD VEG PATCH TO A BORDER THAT NEEDS MORE WORK 
SHE MIGHT KNOCK A FEW POINTS OFF FOR THAT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THEY'RE WALKING TO THAT OTHER ONE 
THIS IS SUPER SO YOU'VE EXTENDED THIS BORDER THIS WAS A MUCH SMALLER BORDER 
YES BEFORE IT JUST FOLLOWED THE CURVE OF THESE PLANTS 
IT'S HARD TO FATHOM WHAT SHE THINKS YEAH 
SHE JUST SMILES ALL THE TIME DOES SHE 
AND YOU MUST SEE THIS BORDER FROM YOUR WINDOW I DO 
THAT'S MAGICAL REALLY LOVELY AND BUILT UP IN LAYERS ABSOLUTELY SUPER 
IT'S ALL OVER AND NOW FOR THE MOMENT OF TRUTH HAS ANDREA DONE ENOUGH 
THE GARDEN IS LOOKING GOOD I WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ENTRY INTO YOUR GARDEN 
IT'S A WORRY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY'LL SEE IF VISITORS COME 
IT'S THEIR FIRST VIEW OF THE GARDEN 
BUT AN AWFUL LOT OF HARD WORK HAS BEEN GOING ON 
SO I'D BE DELIGHTED IF YOU'D LIKE TO OPEN YOUR GARDEN OH THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THAT'S GREAT WELL DONE 
CONGRATULATIONS YOU DESERVE IT YOU'VE WORKED SO HARD 
I'M THRILLED I'VE WORKED HARD AND JOHN HAS AS WELL 
ANDREA'S DONE IT NEXT YEAR SHE'LL BE OPENING HER GARDEN FOR THE YELLOW BOOK 
IT'S THE END OF JUNE AND WE'RE AT GEOFFREY AND SELWYN'S WONDERFULLY EXOTIC GARDEN 
FOR THEIR VERY FIRST OPEN DAY NOT SURPRISINGLY THINGS ARE A LITTLE FRANTIC 
THERE'S ABOUT HALF AN HOUR TO GO 
I FEEL A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT 
I'M NOT FEELING TOO BAD 
DESPITE BOTH HAVING LOTS OF GRAND DESIGNS THAT NEVER SEEMED LIKELY TO GET DONE THEY'VE MADE IT 
WHAT WAS ALREADY A SMASHING GARDEN LOOKS EVEN MORE SPECTACULAR 
THE AREA UNDER THE BEECH TREE IS TRANSFORMED WITH THE NEW STEPS 
THE SUMMER HOUSE LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN THERE FOR YEARS 
AND ALL IN ALL THE WHOLE PLACE IS A JOY 
AND BEFORE TOO LONG VISITORS ARE STREAMING THROUGH THE GATES TO DISCOVER A REAL GEM 
THE SPECIAL GUEST OF HONOUR IS ANNE GEOFFREY AND SELWYN'S FRIEND WHO'S BEEN SUFFERING WITH CANCER 
WHEN YOU DISCOVERED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO OPEN THE GARDEN FOR THE NATIONAL GARDENS SCHEME 
AND IT WAS PROMPTED BY YOU WHAT DID YOU THINK WONDERFUL THAT'S THE SORT OF PEOPLE THEY ARE 
AND HOW HAS THE DAY TURNED OUT 
I DIDN'T EXPECT SO MANY PEOPLE FANTASTIC 
ALL THE HARD WORK THEY'VE PUT IN WE'VE HAD TO COME INSIDE TO GET AWAY FROM EVERYBODY 
IT'S GREAT THAT THE NATIONAL GARDENS SCHEME RAISES MONEY FOR CHARITY 
THE ASSISTANT COUNTY ORGANISER JO HINDS COULDN'T STAY AWAY 
IT'S A REALLY UNUSUAL AND INTERESTING COLLECTION OF PLANTS' 
AND INTERESTING GARDEN TO SEE 
THE WHOLE SETTING AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS LOVELY 
I'M REALLY PLEASED TO HAVE IT IN THE SCHEME 
SO WHAT DID YOU THINK IT WAS INCREDIBLE 
THE REACTION OF THE PEOPLE WAS GREAT IT GAVE US A LOT OF CONFIDENCE 
THE MONEY RAISED WAS JUST INCREDIBLE 
WE'RE REALLY PLEASED WITH IT 
WE'VE PROBABLY RAISED ABOUT SIX HUNDRED WHICH IS AMAZING 
ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT AGAIN NOW WE'VE BROKEN THE BACK AND WE KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT YES 
I DON'T THINK YOU TWO WILL EVER STOP NO 
DESPITE A REALLY DAUNTING START GEOFFREY AND SELWYN'S DREAM OF A PERFECT OPEN DAY 
BECAME A REALITY THE SUN SHONE THEY'VE HAD ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY VISITORS THROUGH THE GATES 
AND THEY'VE RAISED MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED FOR CHARITY IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN A MORE MAGICAL FIRST OPEN DAY 
SO UNFAIR YOU GET NO SAY OVER WHO'S ON YOUR TEAM BUT YOU GET THE BLAME 
IT'S RIDICULOUS 
TELEVISON EMPHASIS ON WINNERS AND LOSERS WHAT ABOUT IDEAS RESEARCH 
I PUT IN ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT YEAH MATE WE'VE ALL GOT A STORY LIKE THAT 
WHERE ARE WE 
ONE BRAND NEW SERIES TWO REGULAR CANDIDATES 
I AM A WINNER I AM
