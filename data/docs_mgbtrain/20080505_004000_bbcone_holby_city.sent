UNLESS OF COURSE YOU'D LIKE TO STAY AND OBSERVE 
AS TEMPTING AS THAT SOUNDS I DO HAVE A WARD TO RUN 
MESH AND SCISSORS PLEASE THERE'S ENOUGH DIAPHRAGM TO COVER THE DEFECT 
YES WELL MESH IS THE STANDARD REPAIR FOR A PUNCTURE WOUND OF THIS SIZE 
ALL YOU'RE DOING IS INTRODUCING MORE FOREIGN MATERIAL MESH OFFERS GREATER STABILITY THAN SUTURE REPAIR 
THE KIND OF PROFESSIONALISM I'VE COME TO EXPECT FROM A GENERAL SURGEON 
WE SHOULD DO THIS MORE OFTEN 
I HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO WITH MY TIME THAN WATCH SUCH PEDESTRIAN PROCEDURES 
BUT OF COURSE IF YOU'D LIKE TO WATCH SOMETHING MORE DYNAMIC 
I'M SURE MY TEAM ON DARWIN WILL MAKE YOU FEEL WELCOME 
LET'S GET THAT CLEANED UP FOR YOU 
EXCUSE ME A MINUTE

ERIC ARE YOU IN THERE 
IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER I'D SAY YOU WEREN'T PLEASED TO SEE ME 
SOME OF YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD THAT I HAVE RECENTLY TAKEN OVER AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE BYRNE FOUNDATION 
AND IN THAT CAPACITY I AM VERY PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE 
THAT TODAY MARKS THE BEGINNING OF AN EXCITING NEW CHAPTER FOR US 
SERVING NOT JUST TO REAWAKEN PUBLIC INTEREST IN WHAT WE DO 
BUT ALSO HIGHLIGHTING THE WONDERFUL WORK THAT GOES ON INSIDE THIS HOSPITAL 
ON WHICH NOTE I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE HUMPHREY 
HE HAS KINDLY AGREED TO STAR IN OUR CAMPAIGN 
NO ONE SAID ANYTHING ABOUT A COFFIN DODGER 
AS YOU CAN SEE WE WILL ALSO BE REQUIRING THE SERVICES OF A NURSE TO FEATURE ALONGSIDE HUMPHREY 
YOU WILL BE ASKED TO TAKE HUMPHREY'S BLOOD PRESSURE 
WHILST EMBODYING THE FIRST CLASS CARE THAT THIS HOSPITAL IS RENOWNED 
I RECKON SHE'S BEEN OVERDOSING ON THE H. R. T. PATCHES MYSELF 
BUT I MUST STRESS THAT THIS IS ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN JUST A PHOTOGRAPH

TWO HUNDRED QUID THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT TAKING THE PHOTOGRAPHS TODAY WILL BE JAKE

NURSE ANDERSON HERE WILL CHASE THEM UP FOR YOU WON'T YOU 
WELL I'VE GOT TO HAND IT TO YOU JAMIE 
THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE BEST ONE YET YOU SEE DOCTOR 
HE'LL DO ANYTHING TO MAKE SURE HE HAS THE LAST WORD 
BUT FAKING A HEART ATTACK WELL THAT'S IMPRESSIVE EVEN FOR YOU

SO HOW ABOUT GIVING HER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT 
I WOULD SAY THAT SPEED IS OF THE ESSENCE HERE 
SHE TURNED ME DOWN ORIGINALLY YEAH WELL I RATHER THINK SHE COULD USE THE CASH 
THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHO NEEDS THE MONEY MR. WILLIAMS 
THIS IS ABOUT FINDING THE BEST AMBASSADOR FOR THE FOUNDATION 
IT SEEMS I WAS A LITTLE PREMATURE IN MY DIAGNOSIS 
WHAT THE ECHO SHOWS AN INFECTION HAS CAUSED SOME OF THE SUTURES HOLDING IT IN PLACE TO DETACH 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IF THE VALVE COMES LOOSE IT COULD BE CIRCULATED AROUND THE BODY 
ARE YOU SAYING IT'S SERIOUS WE NEED TO GET YOU TO THEATRE 
GET EMMA FOR ME TELL HER I NEED HER HERE 
YOU HAD US ALL WORRIED BACK THERE THAT BOSS OF YOURS HAS REALLY PUT ME THROUGH THE WRINGER TODAY

WHERE ARE YOU GOING I'VE GOT A SERVICE 
PERHAPS WE SHOULD DELEGATE SOME OF THE TASKS YOU'LL BE BACK ON YOUR FEET IN NO TIME 
AND SHIRLEY IF YOU COULD INCORPORATE THE FLOWERS INTO YOUR ROTA I'D APPRECIATE IT 
I'M NOT GOING IN THERE I'M NOT GOING IN THERE I WANT EMMA 
IT REALLY IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE GET YOU INTO THEATRE 
IF THE VALVE COMES LOOSE IT COULD BE LIFE THREATENING 
I'M NOT GOING IN WITHOUT EMMA 
RIGHT I SAW HER IN RECEPTION TWENTY MINUTES AGO WE CAN'T DELAY THIS JOSEPH WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE 
THEN SEND A SCRUB NURSE IT'S MY MESS I'LL SORT IT 
EXCUSE ME SORRY
