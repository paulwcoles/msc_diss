ENJOYING THE SUNSHINE WITH ME IS

FORWARD TO YOUR COMPANY AND YOU 
KEEPING THE RIGHT IT IS A VERY 
INTERESTING TIME FOR ALL OF THE 
ROWERS AND IT ALL LATE IN CHINA IN 
FOUR MONTHS TIME WHO BETTER TO 
TAKE US THROUGH WHAT WE CAN EXPECT 
THAN THIS MAN 
THIS IS THE GREAT BRITAIN ROWING 
TEAM OVER FORTY ATHLETES GOING FOR 
GOLD AT THE REGATTA COURSE IN 
BEIJING ALL THE RACING OVER THE 
FIRST WEEK OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN 
FRONT OF THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND SPECTATORS THERE 
ARE FOURTEEN EVENTS ALL COVERING THE SAME 
DISTANCE THE BOAT CLASSES ARE 
DEFINED BY GENDER WEIGHT NUMBER 
OF CREW AND THE OARS LABEL TWO 
OARS MAKE IT A SCULLING BOAT THESE 
ARE SINGLE DOUBLE OR QUADRUPLE OF 
THE SIX CLASSES FOR THE WOMEN IN 
THE OLYMPICS FOUR ARE FOUR 
SCULLERS THE FIRST EVER GREAT 
BRITAIN WIN IN'S MEDAL WAS WON BY 
THE SQUAD WHO TOOK SILVER IN SYDNEY 
ONE ATHLETE ONE OAR FOR EXAMPLE 
THE COXLESS PAIR AND THE COXLESS 
FOUR THERE IS ALSO THE EIGHT AND 
DON'T FORGET THE LITTLE ONE AT THE 
END THIS IS THE ONLY BOAT AT THE 
OLYMPICS THAT HAS A COX THEIR JOB 
IS TO STEER THE BOAT AND INSTRUCT 
THE CREW HOW HAVE WE DONE IN 
PREVIOUS OLYMPICS GREAT BRITAIN 
HAS WON FORTY EIGHT MEDALS AND AT LEAST ONE 
GOLD MEDAL IN EACH OLYMPIC GAMES 
SINCE SO NO PRESSURE THEIR 
THEN YOU SHOW OFF THERE HAS BEEN 
A LOT OF STOCKPILING 
COMMODITIES MARKET BUT YOU GOT 
YOUR FAIR SHARE OF GOLD THIS 
WEEKEND IS THE FIRST OF THREE WORLD 
CUP REGATTAS IT HAS BEEN A BUSY 
WINTER FOR THE BRITISH TEAM NOT 
EVERYTHING HAS BEEN SETTLED AND 
CERTAINLY NOT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF 
WEEKS THEY HAVE BEEN ONE OR TWO 
CHANGES TO THE BRITISH SQUAD 
JUST NINETY DAYS TO BEIJING NOT THAT 
ANYBODY'S COUNTING 
SATURDAY TWENTY SECOND 
MARCH 
TWENTY NINTH MARCH TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
TWENTY FIRST APRIL MARCH THE LAST THREE MONTHS HAVE 
EFFECTIVELY BEEN A BOOT CAMP THE 
LONG REMEMBERS WINTER LAYING THE 
FOUNDATIONS FOR SUMMER OF HOPE 
AND EXPECTATION RELENTLESS WE WE ARE HERE THE OLYMPIC CREW 
SUGGESTION SELECTION THIS IS 
GOING TO BE THE LAST STAGE OF THE 
SERIOUS TESTING FOR THE OLYMPICS 
HOPEFULLY THIS IS WHERE THE FOUR 
GET SET AND WHERE JURGEN GROBLER 
PUTS OUT HIS IDEA OF THE WINNING 
BOAT 
HOW MUCH RACING ARE YOU GOING BOAT TO BE DOING WHO ARE YOU GOING TO 
PICK 
I KNOW NOW WHAT IS GOING ON PICK I THINK ME AND PETER HAVE BEEN 
DOING WELL THROUGHOUT THE YEAR 
WILL BE VERY INTERESTED TO SEE HOW 
JURGEN GROBLER TESTS ARE THE GUYS 
WE ARE GOING TO SEE THE CROWD THE 
CROWN HANDED OVER FROM GREAT 
BRITAIN WHO WOULD BELIEVE IT FOR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A DECADE THE 
GREAT BRITAIN CREWS FAILED TO MAKE 
THE PODIUM THEIR POSITION IN THE 
SPORT WAS UNDER THREAT AND THE AXE 
WAS ABOUT TO FALL 
THERE IS STILL 
TIME TO FINALISE THINGS PROPERLY 
BUT FOR THE MOMENT ANYWAY TOM 
JAMES IS GOING TO BE REPLACING ALEX 
ALEX WILL BE MISSED FOR EVERYTHING 
HE GAVE US TOM JAMES EARNED HIS 
PLACE HE HAS GOT A LOT OF GOOD 
QUALITIES I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO 
SEEING WHERE HE CAN TAKE THE BOAT 
WHAT NEW LEVELS HE CAN MAKE IS IS THERE ANY ROOM FOR LOYALTY IN 
PICKING CREWS OR DO YOU HAVE TO BE 
A HARD NOSED BUSINESSMAN 
I THINK 
YOU HAVE TO BE QUITE A HARD NOSED 
BUSINESSMAN OF COURSE YOU KNOW 
THOSE GUYS IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS 
YOU GO WITH THEM THROUGH THE CAMPS 
YOU SIT WITH THEM YOU HAVE FUN 
TOGETHER YOU KNOW THEM VERY WELL 
EVERYBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO BE IN 
THE BOAT 
BEST LAID PLANS TOM 
JAMES HAD BANNED HIS PLACE BUT WAS 
FORCED OUT IN THE LAST FEW DAYS 
BUT THERE WAS NO RECALL FOR ALEX 
PARTRIDGE INSTEAD TOM LUCY WHO 
WAS ALSO IN THE EIGHT GETS HIS 
CHANCE IN THE GLORY BOAT 
NO CHANGES IN THE LEAD WOMEN'S BOAT 
THE REIGNING WORLD CHAMPIONS ARE 
LOOKING TO WIN A FIRST OLYMPIC 
TITLE AND THEY ARE HAPPY FOR THE 
MEN TO TAKE THE STRAIN 
WE ARE 
UNDER A HUGE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE 
FROM OURSELVES AND THE REST OF THE 
COUNTRY IS PROBABLY EXPECTING 
FROM THE WOMEN'S TEAM 
BUT I STILL FEEL THE BIGGEST 
PRESSURE BECAUSE 
BECAUSE THEY PRESSURE BECAUSE HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN THE LEAD 
BOAT AND THERE IS AN INTEREST IN 
WHETHER THEY CAN COME BACK FROM 
THEIR LOSS FROM LAST YEAR SO IN 
WAY THERE IS MORE PRESSURE ON THEM 
AND JURGEN GROBLER HAS A FAULT WAS 
RECORD IN THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
WHEREAS WE ARE STILL TRYING TO MAKE 
OUR FIRST OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL SO IT 
IS A DIFFERENT PRESSURE 
AND THE BRITISH BOAT 
NOW FINALLY EASING OUT AGAIN HE IS 
NOW THREE FEET THE ITALIAN BOAT 
HAS MORE THAN THREE STROKES 
REMAINING AND IT IS GREAT BRITAIN 
THE WORLD CHAMPIONS IN THE MEN'S 
LIGHTWEIGHT COXLESS FOUR 
FIFTEEN YEARS SEPARATE GOALS FOR THE 
LIGHTWEIGHT MEN'S FOUR BUT THEY 
HAVE NEVER WON AND OLYMPIC MEDAL 
IS IT TIME FOR THE LAND THE LIGHT 
WEIGHTS TO ABOUT MUSCLE THEIR 
COUNTERPARTS HISTORY SUGGESTS AND 
DEMANDS THAT OUR MEDAL TALLY 
REMAINS AS BUOYANT AS EVER 
IN THE 
MODERN ERA NO RUNNING NATION HAS 
WON MORE THAN FIVE MEDALS SO WE 
ARE IN THE BALLPARK THE BIG CHANGE 
OF REFERENCE IS THAT LAST YEAR WE 
HAD TEN BOATS IN THE TOP FOUR OF THE 
WORLD THAT HAS TRANSFORMED THE 
DEPTH IF YOU LIKE OF THE SQUAD 
THE LIGHTWEIGHT SQUAD TWO OF THOSE 
THERE IS ONLY THREE OLYMPIC CLASSES 
THAT IS GOING TO LOOK DIFFERENT IF 
WE PULL THAT OFF OUR WOMEN HAVE 
THE DEPTH WE HAVE A WIN IN'S EIGHT 
QUALIFIED NOW WHICH WE DID NOT 
HAVE IN ATHENS AND WE HAVE AS 
STRONG AND THEN'S SCORED WITH 
SCULLERS AS WELL AS SWEEPERS SO I 
FEEL IT IS PRETTY SHARP 
SQUAD BUT BRINGING BACK THE MEDALS 
WILL NOT BE DIFFERENT 
WE HAD ABOUT 
SOME OF THE POLITICS TOM JAMES IS 
WITH US HE HAS BEEN MOVED INTO THE 
COXLESS FOUR BUT HE IS NOT IN THE 
SEAT TODAY BECAUSE HE IS INJURED 
BUT WE WONDERED WHETHER ALEX 
PARTRIDGE THE MAN HE REPLACED 
WOULD BE DEPUTISING FOR HIM THAT 
IS NOT THE CASE AND JURGEN GROBLER 
CAN EXPLAIN HIS REASONS WHY I I THINK WHEN THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN 
HAPPENING ALEX WAS ALREADY THERE 
AND IT WOULD HAVE A DOMINO EFFECT 
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY NEED TO 
DESTROY THE EIGHT WE HAVE A BIG 
HOPE WITH OUR EIGHT AND SO FAR I 
THINK IT IS GOOD NOT TO TOUCH THEM 
IF WE DO NOT NEED TO 
I KNOW YOU 
HAVE BEEN ITCHING TO GET INTO THE 
BOAT AND DISAPPOINTED TO MISS THE 
REGATTA TODAY WHAT IS THE INJURY 
IT WAS A SUSPECTED STRESS FRACTURE 
THERE SCAN SHOWED IT WAS ALL CLEAR 
BUT WITH BIT OF SORENESS IN THE 
BACK WHICH SHOULD HOPEFULLY GO BY 
THE END OF NEXT WEEK SO I SHOULD 
BE IN THE BOAT NEXT TUESDAY 
OVERALL HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE 
PROMOTION TO WHAT HAS BEEN 
DESCRIBED AS THE GLORY BOAT DOES 
IT FEEL LIKE A PROMOTION 
IT DOES 
COMPARED TO ATHENS WHICH WAS A 
REALLY DISMAL EXPERIENCE COMING 
LAST IN THE MEN'S EIGHT IT IS A 
NEW CHALLENGE TO BE IN THE LEAD 
BOAT GOING FOR THE WORLD MEDAL 
AND THERE IS A REALISTIC 
OPPORTUNITY THAT WE CAN DO THAT IT 
HAS BEEN MY AMBITION ALL YEAR AND 
IT HAS FINALLY COME TRUE THE THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE BY PUTTING 
TOM IN AND TAKING ALEX PARTRIDGE 
OUT RATHER LATE IT WAS ONLY IN 
THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS WERE 
YOU SURPRISED AT THE TINY 
IN SOME 
WAYS I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE THE 
FOUR SETTLED A BIT EARLIER SO THAT 
WE COULD CONCENTRATE ON THE EIGHT 
AND THE PAIR TO GET THOSE BOATS 
BRIGHT FOR THE FIRST WORLD CUP RACE 
AND FOR THE SEASON BUT JURGEN 
GROBLER DOES IT HIS WAY AND DOES 
NOT DO IT QUITE THE WAY THAT OTHER 
PEOPLE MAY DO IT AND THE WAY IT 
SEEMS THAT THE TIME AND HE PLAYS 
HIS CARDS AT THE TIME HE FEELS THEY 
HAVE TO BE PLAYED IT SEEMED LIKE 
IN EARLY PART OF THE WINTER THERE 
WAS NOT GOING TO BE ANY CHANGE IN 
THE FOUR EVERYONE SEEMED TO BE 
PLAYING WELL BUT THAT IS IN SOME 
WAYS WHAT I WOULD HAVE TRIED TO 
SELECT THE FOUR EARLIER COS THEN 
YOU COULD PUT THE EMPHASIS ON THE 
EIGHT PEOPLE WOULD BE THINKING DO 
I WANT TO BE IN THE EIGHT WE WON A 
MEDAL IN THE EIGHT AND THE FOUR 
CAME FOURTH BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE 
BEST CHANCE OF WINNING GOLD IS IN 
THE FOUR 
HAS IT BEEN PERCEIVED 
THAT THE JURGEN GROBLER'S 
PRIORITIES HAVE BEEN CHANGED I I CERTAINLY THINK WITH A GROUP OF 
GUYS THAT WE HAVE GOT THAT THIS 
ELECTION IS VERY CLOSE AND HE HAS 
TRIED THE EIGHT AS THE SECOND BOAT 
IN PRACTICE AND THEY HAVE DONE SOME 
GOOD TIMES REALISTICALLY THE 
EIGHT'S COMPETITION IT IS A BIT 
OPEN AND IT IS A GOOD AVENUE FOR 
GREAT BRITAIN TO PERFORM AND 
GETTING ANOTHER GOLD MEDAL SHOWS 
HOW STRONG THE SQUAD IS 
LET'S SEE 
HOW THE COXLESS FOUR GOT ON WITHOUT 
THIS MAN THIS MORNING IN THEIR 
FINAL 
THE FACT THAT WE ARE IN THE SAME 
SCENE THAT WE WERE NINE YEARS AGO 
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE 
OBVIOUSLY WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS 
START THE SEASON WELL AND WHATEVER 
HAPPENS HERE IN MUNICH IT IS NEVER 
GOING TO MAKE THAT GO AWAY AND IN 
A WAY WE DON'T WANT IT TO BECAUSE 
IT HAS BEEN VERY PAINFUL BUT IT 
HAS ALSO BEEN A REALLY BIG SOURCE 
OF MOTIVATION THAT HAS GOT US 
THROUGH REALLY TOUGH GRUELLING 
WINTER'S TRAINING AND WHATEVER 
HAPPENS TOMORROW WE DON'T WANT 
THAT TO GO IT IS THE FINAL OF THE 
MEN'S COXLESS FOUR MACRO GREAT 
BRITAIN SQUEEZE OFF IN LANE NUMBER 
SIX INSIDE THEM THE CZECH 
REPUBLIC IN FIVE JUST LOOKING AT ALL THE CREWS NOW 
POWERING OUT FOR THE FIRST ONE HUNDRED 
METRES AND GREAT BRITAIN ARE A 
LITTLE SHAKY ON THE FIRST TWO 
STROKES THEY CAUGHT THE WAVES AND 
THE WATER GIVING ITALY THE CHANCE 
TO MOVE OUT BUT THE CRUDES WILL 
START TO SETTLE IN IT IS IMPORTANT 
TO SETTLE INTO A GOOD LONG BRITAIN 
THAT IS WHAT THE BRITISH FOUR 
DISCOVERED IN A WAY THEY RATHER 
LOST IT LAST YEAR BUT I FOUND THE 
SECURITY OF GOOD RHYTHM THE 
DUTCH ARE VERY QUICK AND VERY GOOD 
IN TAIL WINDS THESE CONDITIONS 
SUIT THEM THEY WENT OUT EARLY 
ABOUT THESE CONDITIONS DO NOT SUIT 
THEM BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE BIG 
FINISH AND IN A HEAD WIND YOU 
HAVE TO SIT OUT IN THE FINISH THE 
DUTCH TRIED TO KEEP IT GOING IN AND 
NICE CIRCULAR MOVEMENT AND AS 
RESULT THEY DON'T GET THE MOMENTUM 
AT THE END OF THE STROKE THAT KEEPS 
IT RUNNING AS THEY RECOVER ALREADY 
HOLLAND ARE BEGINNING TO SLIDE BACK 
HALF A LENGTH UP GREAT BRITAIN ARE 
CLOSEST TO US KEEPING THE RATE 
REASONABLY HIGH THE CREWS ARE 
STARTING TO SETTLE IT IS IMPORTANT 
FOR THEM TO STEP ON THEY WANT A 
GOOD PRICE FROM THE FIVE HUNDRED METRE MARK 
TO LENGTHEN OUT GREAT BRITAIN HAD 
A FABULOUS START THE RACE IS GOING 
ACCORDING TO PLAN THEY ARE IN THE 
BETTER LANE BECAUSE OF THE WIND 
CONDITIONS IT IS STAGGERED SO THE 
TWO FASTEST CREWS FROM THE SEMI 
FINAL FIND THEMSELVES IN LANE SIX 
AND LANE FIVE WILLIAM EARL LYND 
GOING NOWHERE WE CAN'T SEE WITH AT 
THE CAMERA WHERE THE CZECH REPUBLIC 
OF EDGE LANE FOUR IT IS 
STARTING 
A IN THE SEMI FINAL THEY STARTING MADE A BIG PUSH AT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY METRES AND 
THAT OPEN THEM UP A LENGTH BEYOND 
THE REST OF THE FIELD THEY ARE 
DOING IT NOW THEY HAVE MADE A PUSH 
AND THAT EXTRA BIT OF FLEXIBILITY 
HAS GIVEN THEM THAT EXTRA CUSHION 
THAT IS SOMETHING THEY CAN LAY DOWN 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD INTO THE LAST FIVE HUNDRED METRES AND THAT 
IS IMPRESSIVE IT HAS BEEN LONG 
TIME SINCE GREAT BRITAIN HAVE BEEN 
WAY OUT OVER TWO LENGTHS BETWEEN 
GREAT BRITAIN AND THE REST OF THE 
FIELD THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE 
DISTANCE AT THIS STAGE IN THE 
SEASON STEVE WILLIAMS SPOKE ABOUT 
THE PAIN THE PAIN OF LOSING LAST 
YEAR NOT BEING ON THE MEDAL PODIUM 
THERE IS ALL MANNER OF THINGS 
DRIVING THIS CREW WARM BUT THEY 
LOOK VERY IMPRESSIVE THE DUTCH ARE 
STRUGGLING AGAINST THE CZECH 
REPUBLIC 
I SAW THE DUTCH AFTER THE REPUBLIC RACE YESTERDAY AFTER THE SEMI 
FINAL AND THEY WERE COMPLETELY 
BEMUSED BY WHY THEY HAD BEEN SO 
BADLY BEATEN THEY WERE REALLY 
RIGHT OUT OF IT 
THERE IS A GREAT 
RACE DEVELOPING FOR THE SILVER 
MEDAL POSITION GREAT BRITAIN OUT 
FRONT LOOKING BACK STRETCHING OUT 
THEIR LEAD BUT THE RACE IS ON FOR 
THE SILVER MEDAL BETWEEN LANE 
NUMBER FIVE THE CZECH REPUBLIC 
YOU HAVE GOT THE NETHERLANDS IN A 
NUMBER FOUR AND GERMANY IN LANE 
NUMBER TWO ANY ONE OF THESE THREE 
CREWS WITH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY METRES REMAINING CAN 
SNEAK INTO THE SILVER MEDAL 
POSITION THIS IS THE VIEW IF YOU 
ARE IN THE MEN'S COXLESS FOUR OUT 
FRONT GREAT BRITAIN PADDLE UP TO 
THE LINE THE RACE IS STILL 
DEVELOPING FOR THE SILVER MEDAL 
THE CZECH REPUBLIC HAVE FINALLY 
STARTED TO PUT THE SPRINT IN THE 
NETHERLANDS HAVE BEEN DEFEATED UP 
TO THE LINE GREAT BRITAIN OVER THE 
LINE GREAT BRITAIN ARE SAFE ON 
THE SILVER COMING THROUGH IT WILL 
BE THE CZECH REPUBLIC AND GERMANY 
STEAL THE BRONZE MEDAL A GREAT 
RACE A FANTASTIC RESULT 
BRITAIN ARE BACK 
PLENTY FOR THE COMMENTATORS TO GET 
THEIR TEETH INTO IN THAT COMMENTARY 
BOX SURE TO GET THE ADRENALIN 
LEVEL SURGING WHAT A DIFFERENCE A 
YEAR MAKES NOWHERE NEAR THE PODIUM 
LAST YEAR AND NOW A TWO LENGTHS 
AHEAD OF THE FIELD 
LET'S GET THEIR 
AHEAD OF THE FIELD LET'S GET THEIR REACTION CONGRATULATIONS HOW 
SATISFYING WAS THAT GIVEN THE 
RESULT YOU HAD LAST YEAR 
IT IS AN 
ENORMOUS RELIEF WE WORKED HARD 
LAST YEAR AND HARD THIS YEAR WE 
HAVE ADAPTED IMPROVED AND I AM 
GLAD IT IS PAYING OFF 
AT WHAT 
POINT IN THE RACE TO DO THINK WE 
ARE BACK ON TOP NOW 
IT FELT PRETTY 
GOOD YESTERDAY AFTER THE SEMI FINAL 
AND TODAY GOING THROUGH ONE THOUSAND 
METRES IT WAS JUST LIKE TWO THOUSAND FIVE WHEN 
WE DOMINATED THE RACE VERY EASY TO 
GROW WELL IN THOSE CONDITIONS NEW NEW ZEALAND WHEN WILL WE SEE THEM NO 
NO IDEA THAT IS IN THEIR HANDS ALL 
WE CAN DO IS KEEP WORKING AWAY AT 
WHAT WE DO TODAY WAS A GREAT RACE 
IT HAS TO BE SAID A FAIR ANALYSIS 
OF TODAY IS THAT THE CONDITIONS DID 
SPREAD OUT THE FIELD SO WE WILL BE 
REALISTIC IT WAS A GOOD 
START BUT 
THAT IS 
ALL IT IS TOM IF I WAS 
YOU AND THERE ARE LOT OF 
SIMILARITIES BETWEEN US I WOULD 
TALK TO JURGEN GROBLER AND SAY I 
STAKE MY PLACE 
THAT IS UP TO HIM 
YOU CANNOT SECOND GUESS THESE 
THINGS I WAS PLEASED WITH THE JOB 
I DID PLEASED WITH HOW WE RACED 
BUT I AM STILL GOING FOR A SEAT AT 
THE OLYMPICS AND I WILL LEAVE THE 
REST TO HIM 
I HAD 
A REALLY STRONG 
POWERFUL RHYTHM 
IT WAS 
A PLEASURE 
TO ROW THE BOAT 
I'M WONDER HOW TOM JAMES FEELS 
ABOUT 
THAT THE 
MAN TAKING YOUR 
PLACE TODAY WAS THAT OF SOME 
COMFORT TO YOU OR UNSETTLING IT IT IS FANTASTIC IT IS A GREAT RESULT 
I HOPED AND EXPECTED LOOKING 
WHAT WE HAD DONE BEFOREHAND SOME 
OF THE TIMES THE CONDITIONS SPREAD 
DACRUZ OUT SO 
WE HAVE 
GOT TO BE 
REALISTIC IT IS 
NOT QUITE 
GOING TO 
BE SEVEN SECONDS BUT THIS 
TIME OF 
YEAR IT IS A GREAT RESULT 
IT SHOWS 
ALL 
THE WORK WE HAVE DONE THE WINTER MOVING WELL TOGETHER 
IT IS POSITIVE 
WHAT WAS YOUR 
ASSESSMENT STEVE WHO ELSE COULD 
FEASIBLY CHALLENGE FOR THIS GOLD 
MEDAL IN A FEW MONTHS' TIME 
POTENTIALLY THE AMERICANS THEY 
NORMALLY PUT THEIR BEST GUYS IN THE 
MEN'S EIGHT EVERY TIME THEY HAVE 
TRIED TO DO THE FOUR AS WELL THEY 
HAVE LOST BOTH EVENTS SLOVAKIA 
DIDN'T QUALIFY IN MUNICH BUT DID 
FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIPS LAST YEAR 
QUITE YOUNG CREWS AND IN THE RIGHT 
CONDITIONS THEY CAN ROLL WELL 
ROW WELL THEY HAVE USED LAST YEAR 
AS MOTIVATION AND IT IS GREAT FOR 
THEM TO COME OUT AND SAY WE ARE 
BACK TO WHERE WE WERE 
BEFORE IT 
DOWN TO 
EVERYONE ELSE 
TO PUT THE 
MARKET OUT NOW WHEN THIS MAN COMES 
BACK WHAT MORE 
CAN HE 
HAD TO THAT 
QUARTET IF THEY 
WIN BY 
SEVEN QUARTET SECONDS THEY HAVE GOT TO TRY 
WIN BY MORE 
VERY BEST OF LUCK YOU 
WILL 
BE BACK 
HOPEFULLY FOR LUCERNE 
YES YES 
COULD IT BE THAT THE YES YES ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE BRITISH WOMEN 
MIGHT EQUAL OR EVEN SURPASSED THE 
ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE BRITISH MEN IN 
BEIJING IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED 
BEFORE THE BEST THE BRITISH WOMEN 
HAS ACHIEVED HIS TWO SILVER MEDALS 
BOOK BUT WITH THE QUAD SCULLERS IN 
THE MIX ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE ALL 
I HAVE GOT 
TO DO 
IS BEAT THE 
GERMANS IT APPEARS 
THE GERMANS HAVE WON EVERY SINGLE 
OLYMPIC TITLE IN THE WOMEN'S QUADS 
OUR AIM THIS YEAR IS TO WIN THAT 
FROM THEM BUT THEY WILL NOT GIVE 
ANYTHING AWAY 
THEY FEEL 
THIS IS 
THEIR EVENT THEIR RACE AND IT IS 
UP 
TO US 
TO CHALLENGE THEM THE WAY 
WE 
WENT OFF 
THE START YESTERDAY 
THERE IS 
A LOT 
OF DESIRE IN THIS 
GROUP TO CHANGE THAT THIS YEAR GERMANY AND GREAT BRITAIN LEAVE THE 
START AREAS IT LOOKS LIKE GREAT 
BRITAIN HAD THE BETTER START 
LOOKER THAT FROM AUSTRALIA IN LANE 
TWO WE HAVE GOT TO BE CLEVER IN 
THESE CONDITIONS THE BOAT LURCHED 
TO THE LEFT HAND SIDE LOOK AT THAT THE POWER THAT IS 
GREAT BRITAIN REALLY LOOKING TO 
MOVE OUT HALF A LENGTH ON THE 
GERMAN CREW THAT IS KATHERINE 
GRAINGER LEADING HER CREW VERY VERY IMPRESSED HOW THEY HAVE GOT OUT 
THERE BECAUSE THEY CAN BE LEFT 
BEHIND IN THE PAST THEY HAVE BEEN 
SLUGGISH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RACE 
I THINK THEY WILL BE VERY ALERT TO 
THAT I WILL BE VERY WORRIED ABOUT 
KATHERINE SITTING IN THE STROKE 
SEAT VERY HUNGRY TO GET BACK 
GERMANY HAVE NEVER BEEN BEATEN IN 
THIS EVENT AT THE OLYMPICS AND THEY 
DON'T WANT TO START NOW THEY HAVE 
A NEWALL VERY YOUNG THREE AND SHE 
IS A STRONG POWERFUL ATHLETE A 
NEW YOUNG ATHLETE A GREAT START FOR GREAT BRITAIN IN 
THIS FINAL OF THE WOMEN'S QUADRUPLE 
SCULLS ON THEIR LEFT IN LANE SIX 
THE GERMANS ON THEIR RIGHT AND ON 
THEIR RIGHT FIST CHINA GREAT 
BRITAIN DEFINITELY LOOKED SHARP 
BUT WE ARE WATCHING FOR CONTINUED 
BOAT SPEED SO THEY CONTINUE TO MOVE 
OUT AND AWAY FROM THE CHASING CREWS COMFORTABLE THROUGH THE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
METRES THEY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING 
THEY NEEDED TO DO THEY HAVE GOT TO 
MAKE SURE THEY KEEP TEAR HEADS 
BECAUSE THE GERMANS ARE A VERY 
EXPERIENCED GROUP IT HAS BEEN ALL GREAT BRITAIN SO 
FAR FOUR HUNDRED METRES REMAIN AND 
KATHERINE GRAINGER HAS TO COMPOSE 
AND CONSOLIDATE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE 
SO FAR 
THEY ARE ON SONG TO BECOME 
THE FIRST BRITISH WOMEN'S CREW EVER 
TO WIN AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL AND 
THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC THEY HAVE 
GOT TO AVOID INJURY AND MAKING 
SERIOUS MISTAKES BUT THIS IS VERY 
CLASSY LOOK AT THE POWER THE 
DYNAMIC THROUGH THE MIDDLE 
OF THE 
STROKE THEY PICK 
IT UP AND 
ACCELERATED THROUGH THE STROKE AND 
THAT IS KEY VERY GOOD QUAD GOOD BOAT 
ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE METRES REMAINING BOAT THERE ARE NO FIREWORKS NOW THEY 
HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY JUST 
HAVE TO CONTAIN THE GERMANS BECAUSE 
THEY KNOW THEY WILL GET A REAL BIG 
ROAR FROM THE CROWD IN THE 
GRANDSTAND CHINA ARE STARTING TO 
COME BACK THAT IS THE CREW ORDER 
AS WE COME UP TO THE LINE INSIDE 
ONE HUNDRED METRES NOW AND THE BRITISH CREW 
LOOK VERY IMPRESSIVE IT IS ONE 
LANE IT IS COMFORTABLE IT IS 
GREAT BRITAIN PADDLING TO THE LINE 
THEY ARE OPENING UP THEIR TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
SEASON AS THEY MEAN TO GO ON WHO 
KNOWS WHERE THEY WILL BE 
IN IN A FEW MONTHS' TIME 
HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE STANDING 
RIGHT THERE THEY BEGIN WHERE THEY 
LEFT OFF THIS SEASON WITH A WINNER 
ON GERMANY THEY ARE STRENGTHENING 
THEIR CLAIM TO THE TAG OF 
FAVOURITES HEADING INTO THE OLYMPIC 
YEAR THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
FAVOURITES HEADING INTO THE OLYMPIC YEAR THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
YEAR THE OLYMPIC GAMES CATHERINE A BIT OF A PERSONAL 
VICTORY THERE 
WE HAVE RACED OVER 
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS SHE IS 
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ATHLETE IN THE 
WORLD SO SHE BRINGS A LOT OF 
RESPECT AND SUCCESS WITH HER BUT IT 
IS GREAT THAT WE HAD THE TOUGHEST 
OPPOSITION ON THE DAY 
AND IT 
RAISES 
OUR STANDARD YOU 
HAVE HAD 
A COUPLE 
OUR STANDARD OF VICTORIES OVER 
THE LAST 
FEW 
YEARS BUT WHERE 
DOES THAT 
RANK 
THAT ONE WAS 
GOOD WE 
KNEW IT WAS 
REALLY 
STRONG OPPOSITION 
OUT THERE 
SO WE KNEW WE HAD 
TO PRODUCE 
OUR 
BEST AND WE STILL STAYED CALM AND 
PRODUCED 
A GOOD 
RACE DEFINITELY 
MORE TO COME 
IT SEEMED TO US ON 
THE BANK THAT IT WAS VERY MATURE 
THERE WERE NO WOBBLES YES WE WERE 
YES WE WERE REALLY COMPOSED WE KNOW VERY WELL 
THAT WE DON'T GET MANY RACES THE 
EASIER BUT EACH ONE IS 
PRACTISE FOR 
THE OLYMPIC FINAL SO WE 
HAVE GOT 
TO 
MAKE THE MOST 
OF EACH 
RACE WE HAVE 
WE WENT 
OUT WITH 
CONFIDENCE AND 
REACTED TO 
WHATEVER WAS 
THROWN AT 
US IT WAS 
A GOOD 
START OF THE YEAR 
FOR US 
FIRST THOUGHTS GOING OVER 
FOR US THE LINE 
THAT WAS REALLY HARD 
OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A RELIEF TO WIN IT 
ANYTHING LESS WOULD HAVE BEEN A 
DISAPPOINTMENT BUT IT WAS A LOT 
MORE LAST YEAR IT PERHAPS WE 
WERE TO FRONT ENDED IN THE RACES SO 
THIS YEAR WE SAID WE WANT TO BE THE 
FASTEST RIGHT THE 
WAY DOWN 
THE 
TRACK IT WAS 
GOOD TO 
COME OUT 
TRACK IT WAS GOOD TO COME OUT TODAY AND 
MIDDLE OF 
ANYTHING 
THE 
GERMANS WANTED TO THROW AT US 
UNUSUALLY IN THESE RACES THAT WAS 
A VERY VERY STRONG FINAL NO ONE 
STILL TO COME IN EFFECTIVELY IT 
MUST GIVE A LOT OF ENCOURAGEMENT 
FROM THE BRITISH PERSPECTIVE THEY 
ARE LIKELY TO BE THE THREE 
MEDALISTS 
THESE GIRLS NOW HAVE GONE THROUGH 
ALMOST UNBEATEN FOR THE LAST THREE 
YEARS THEY HAVE WON 
THERE IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF 
KNOWING THAT BRITAIN'S WOMEN HAVE 
NEVER WON AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
THERE IS PRESSURE BUT THIS GROUP 
OF GIRLS THAT WE HAVE GOT NOT JUST 
THE QUAD BUT THEY HAVE TO BREAK UP 
THE BACK OF THAT THEY HAVE DONE 
EVERYTHING IN ROWING THERE IS TO DO 
APART FROM WIN THAT GOLD MEDAL AND 
THAT IS GOING TO BE TOUGH TO COPE 
WITH BUT THEY CAN DO IT 
THE SUB 
PLOT IS THAT THE GERMAN DOUBLE A. IS 
TRYING TO DO AS STEVE REDGRAVE AND 
GET FIVE GOLD MEDALS 
NO CHANCE 
STEVE IT IS ONE OF THE HEAVYWEIGHTS 
OF THE ROWING WORLD BUT OUR 
LIGHTWEIGHT MEN HAVE BEEN TURNING 
ON THE POWER AS WELL LAST YEAR 
THE LIGHTWEIGHT COXLESS FOUR THEY 
MADE HISTORY BY WINNING A WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP GOLD FOR THE FIRST 
TIME EVER AND THAT HIS STORY LINE 
UP IS UNCHANGED TODAY HISTORIC 
WE KNEW THAT THE TRAINING WAS GOING 
WELL LAST YEAR AND THIS IS THE 
REGATTA THAT WE HAVE TO PROVE 
OURSELVES IN YET AGAIN THE SAME 
COURSE AS LAST YEAR IT IS STILL 
THE FIRST RACE OF THE SEASON AND WE 
CANNOT AS OUR COACH SAYS START 
SIX BOATS LEVEL IT IS ALL ABOUT 
YOUR BOAT AND HOW FAST YOUR BOAT 
MOVES HAVEN'T TAKEN ANYTHING FOR GRANTED A VERY NERVOUS START IN THE FIRST 
FEW METRES OF THIS FINAL GREAT 
BRITAIN HAD A PRETTY DODGY FIRST 
FIVE STROKES THEY HAVE HAD FEW 
STEERING ISSUES WHICH HAS RESULTED 
SO FAR IN CHINA EASING OUT TO A 
HALF LENGTH LEAD BUYING THEM 
GERMANY IN THE BLACK BOLD ARE ALSO 
PUTTING PRESSURE ON BEHIND THEM 
BLACKBALLED GREAT BRITAIN THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONS OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN ARE 
CURRENTLY IN LANE NUMBER SIX LANE 
NUMBER FIVE JUST CREEPING SADIQ IN 
LANE ONE FRANCE IN LANE TWO 
IRELAND GERMANY GREAT BRITAIN IN 
LANE SIX 
GERMANY ARE PUSHING HARD 
NOT GROWING WELL BUT THEY HAVE 
MOVED AHEAD AND AGAIN THAT MAN IN 
THE BRITISH BOAT IS LOOKING ACROSS 
IT DOESN'T HELP YOUR SPEED IF YOU 
ARE LOOKING AT YOUR OPPONENTS WILL 
STOP YOU START TO RACE TO YOUR 
OPPONENT'S' RACE AND NOT YOUR OWN 
RACE AND THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING 
THEY WILL TAKE A LOT OF STRENGTH 
FROM HAVING ROAD THROUGH THE WORLD 
CHAMPION THAT IS THE GREAT BRITAIN 
STROKE SIDE OUT TO THE RIGHT SIDE 
OF THINGS SO IT IS JAMES CLARKE 
AND JAMES LINDSAY FYNN STRUGGLING 
TO GET HOLD OF THE WATER 
IMPERATIVE IN THESE CONDITIONS THAT 
YOU ARE CLEAN AND SHARP ON LET'S 
SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE LAST FIVE HUNDRED 
METRES OF THIS FINAL GREAT BRITAIN 
HAVE BEEN NERVOUS OR AWAKE THROUGH 
THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT IS 
NERVOUS RAISED FROM THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONS THEY NEED TO THINK WE 
HAVE GOT HERE WE ARE STILL WITHIN 
SHOUTING DISTANCE CHINA HAVE NOT 
GONE AWAY IF ANYTHING THE GERMANS 
HAVE BEEN CREEPING SO THE CHINESE 
HAD A STRONG MIDDLE ONE THOUSAND AND THEY 
ARE NOT MOVING NOW IT IS TIME FOR 
GREAT BRITAIN TO MOVE RICHARD 
CHAMBERS HAS BEEN WATCHING AND HAS 
TO COAX HIS GUYS IN FRONT OF HIM 
WE CAN TURN THIS AROUND WE CAN 
MOVE ON THEY HAVE A FAST FINISH 
AND THEY NEED TO APPLY IT AND LIFT 
THE BOAT TO MOVE FORWARDS THEY THEY HAVE FOUND A RHYTHM AND A LITTLE 
MORE COHESION IT WAS A LITTLE 
UNSETTLED EARLIER ON BUT THEY HAVE 
CHECKED GERMANY'S ADVANCE IF THEY 
CAN TURN ON THAT EXTRA SPEED THAT 
THEY SHOWED LAST YEAR WHEN THEY WON 
THE GOLD MEDAL IF THEY CAN TURN 
THAT ON THEY CAN DO IT 
IT IS 
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE STROKES NOT AN AWFUL LOT 
IF YOU NEED TO LIFT IT UP BUT WE 
ARE LOOKING AT THE WORLD CHAMPIONS 
AND IF YOU ARE WORLD CHAMPIONS YOU 
HAVE TO SHOW YOUR CLASS THE 
PRESSURE IS ON AND THE GERMANS ARE 
HOLDING ON A VERY STRONG CHALLENGE 
FROM GREAT BRITAIN CHINA CONTINUE 
TO LEAD THEIR HEADS ARE GOING 
SLIGHTLY DOWN THE CHINESE KNOW 
THAT THE BRITISH ARE COMING BACK 
AND WITH THEM ARE GERMANY INSIDE 
ONE HUNDRED IT IS CHINA ANYTHING FROM 
GREAT BRITAIN AND GERMANY THE 
BRITISH CREW COULD JUST BE STROKE 
FOR STROKE COMING THROUGH IN SECOND 
POSITION THE FORMER WORLD 
CHAMPIONS CHINA WILL TAKE IT AND 
GREAT BRITAIN JUST SQUEEZE BACK 
INTO THE SILVER MEDAL POSITION 
THEY NUDGED OUT A VERY GALLANT 
GERMAN CREW WHAT A RACE WHAT A 
RESULT CHINA GREAT BRITAIN AND 
GERMANY 
I GUESS THERE WOULD BE A CONCERN AT 
HOW EASILY THE CHINESE GET AWAY 
EARLY IN THE RACE 
THE CHINESE DID 
WIN THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS TWO 
YEARS AGO OUR GUYS WON LAST YEAR 
SO THEY ARE A CLASS ACT BUT THEY 
DID SEEM TO HAVE QUITE A BIG MARGIN 
AT SOME POINT WHAT WE DID NOT SEE 
IS THAT THE CREW BORO GOING OFF THE 
START A OF FOUR STARTED TO SING TO 
THE WHEELS SPINNING THE BLADES 
SEEMED TO BE GOING REALLY QUICKLY 
I DUNNO IF THAT IS THE TENSION OF 
BEING WORLD CHAMPIONS IN A 
FANTASTIC YEAR THEY HAD LAST YEAR 
AND THE PRESSURE OF TRYING TO 
REPEAT IT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN 
TRYING TO GET AN CLOSE INTO THE 
RACE AND THERE WAS NOT MUCH IN THE 
FINISH 
TOO MUCH REVVING AT THE FINISH START BUT COMING GOOD AT THE END L. 
AM SURE OUR STEEDS AND MYSELF AND 
MANY OF YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT 
FANTASTIC THRASH AS I CALL IT IN 
THE TWO THOUSAND SYDNEY OLYMPICS WHEN THE 
BRITISH MEN'S EIGHT TOOK GOLD IN 
DRAMATIC CIRCUMSTANCES ALL THESE 
YEARS ON IT WOULD APPEAR THAT OUR 
SPIES HAVE BEEN TELLING US JURGEN 
GROBLER HAS BEEN LOADING THIS EIGHT 
WITH SOME VERY HEAVY WEIGHT TALENT 
AND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY COULD 
PRODUCE THE GOODS 
I AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT BEING 
HERE I'M REALLY PLEASED TO BE 
ROWING WITH THE GUYS I AM ROWING 
WITH WE HAVE TWO BRILLIANT 
COACHES AND THE EIGHT GOT THE 
BRONZE MEDAL LAST YEAR THEY ARE A 
GROUP OF NOT JUST EIGHT GUYS A 
GROUP OF ABOUT TWELVE GUYS AND THEY 
ARE ALL REALLY DRIVEN AND THEY KNOW 
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AND THEY HAVE 
GOT AN EQUAL CHANCE OF WINNING A 
GOLD MEDAL AS THE FOUR 
I THINK 
WITH THE EIGHT IT IS NOT FALLING 
INTO A DEEP HOLE WE HAVE TWO BOATS 
I SEE THEM QUITE LEVEL IN OUR 
EXPECTATION AT THE HALFWAY MARK THE 
AUSTRALIANS ARE LEADING BY ABOUT 
THREE QUARTERS OF A LENGTH LOOK 
HOW CLOSE IT IS BETWEEN GREAT 
BRITAIN AND CHINA THOSE THREE 
CREWS STEP UP AND TRY TO MOVE AWAY 
FROM THE GERMAN CREW WHO WENT 
THROUGH THE HALFWAY MARK IN FOURTH 
POSITION THE BRITISH COME TRUE 
HAVE CONTAINED NOW THAT WAS THE 
MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE SECOND 
FIVE HUNDRED CONTAIN THE AUSTRALIANS' SPEED 
THAT THEY HAD THE EASY SPEED IN 
THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED THE CHINESE ARE 
STARTING TO STRUGGLE AS WELL 
GERMANY ARE BEGINNING TO SHOW LITTLE BIT BUT THEY DID GET DROPPED 
QUITE SERIOUSLY 
I LIKE THE WAY THE 
AUSTRALIAN CREW IS MOVING THEY 
LOOK CONFIDENT THAT GREAT BRITAIN 
IS MOVING ON THEM THEY HAVE BEEN 
EATING BACK AUSTRALIA HAS TO DO 
TOO MUCH IN LANE FOUR NOT NICE 
PLACE TO BE GREAT BRITAIN MOVING 
WELL NOW 
GREAT BRITAIN WILL BE 
CONFIDENT THEY HAVE GOT A PRETTY 
QUICK LAST FINISH THEY HAVE THE 
CONFIDENCE AND THEY WILL BE TOLD 
THAT THEY ARE THE WORLD BRONZE 
MEDALLISTS FROM LAST YEAR THEIR 
SECRET TAPPING COMING OUT THEY 
HAVE BEEN DOING SOME QUICK TIMES IN 
TRAINING BUT THIS IS WHERE YOU 
REALLY HAVE TO DO IT THEY ARE 
CAPABLE OF MOVING ON 
THEY HAVE HAD 
SO MUCH INJURY AND DIFFICULTY 
THERE WAS ONE WEEK AT THE WHEN THEY 
HAD TEN DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN THE BOAT 
IT IS A CONSTANT CHANGE AROUND IT 
IS AN IN THE LAST WEEK THAT THEY 
HAVE BEEN TOGETHER AS THESE UNIT 
WE HAVEN'T GOT THE UNITED STATES OR 
CANADA HERE BUT THIS IS A VERY 
STRONG FIELD 
FORTUNE FAVOURS THE 
BRAVE AND WHO CAN GO EARLY AS WE 
GO THROUGH THE LAST TINY MARK IT 
IS ALL ABOUT SPRINTING AND KEEPING 
IT TOGETHER HERE COME THE BRITISH 
CREW IN LANE NUMBER FIVE TIMING 
OUTSIDE IN LANE SIX THE CHINESE 
ARE MOVING ON THE GAP IS 
INCREDIBLE AGAINST GERMANY WHO WENT 
THROUGH THE LAST MARK IN FOURTH 
POSITION TRACKING HUNTING 
CRAWLING BACK THE BRITISH CREW 
STROKE FOR STROKE COMING BACK NOW 
IT IS QUARTER OF A LENGTH AND THEY 
ARE RUNNING OUT OF WATER THE 
CHINESE ARE ALSO PUSHING ON HARD 
LOOKING AT THE GERMAN CREW IN LANE 
THREE AND THEY ARE NOT GOING TO 
CONTEND FOR THE GOLD TODAY THE 
BRITISH CREW GAINED HALF A SECOND 
ON THE AUSTRALIANS IN THE LAST FIVE HUNDRED 
METRES SO AGAIN THIS MOVING IT 
IS THE SPEED IT IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY METRES 
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE STROKES REMAIN IT IS NOW 
GETTING RIGHT DOWN TO THE WIRE THE 
CHINESE LOOK AS THOUGH THEY ARE 
GOING LEFT AND BACKWARDS THE 
BRITISH CREW ARE GOING FROM 
STRENGTH TO STRENGTH IT IS GREAT 
BRITAIN TRACKING AND HOUNDING AGAIN 
THE AUSTRALIANS HAVE HAD A FABULOUS 
REGATTA THEY HAVE TURNED AROUND 
THE RESULT FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THEY ARE 
HOLDING ON THE BRITISH HAVE TO 
KEEP THEIR HEADS UP THERE IS ONLY 
A QUARTER OF A LENGTH IN IT THEY 
ARE INSIDE ONE HUNDRED METRES IT IS 
DESPERATE HERE FOR THE BRITISH AS 
THEY COME BACK A CANVAS BETWEEN 
GOLD AND SILVER AND THE 
AUSTRALIANS WILL HOLD ON THEY WILL 
HOLD IT TO THE LINE AND IT IS GOAL 
FOR AUSTRALIA AND SILVER FOR GREAT 
BRITAIN IT IS BRONZE FOR CHINA 
WHAT IT WAS IS A FABULOUS RACE HERE 
ALL THEIR HEADS GO DOWN IN THE 
BOATS BECAUSE IT WAS A MONUMENTAL 
EFFORT FROM ALL THREE 
SILVER THIS TIME BUT BRUNO'S NEXT 
TIME IT DOES SHOW JURGEN GROBLER'S 
PRIORITIES ARE CHANGING WE HAD 
ABOUT ANY DECENT PAIR LAST YEAR AND 
THEY HAVE GONE INTO THE EIGHTH DOES 
IT SAY TO YOU THAT HIS SECOND 
PRIORITY IS THIS EIGHT 
IT IS FAIR 
FOR THE ATHLETES AS WELL THEY WANT 
TO DO AN EIGHT AND IT IS PUTTING 
ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET THE 
PAIR WILL CERTAINLY BE WHICHEVER 
ON THE CENT WILL BE OUR WEAKEST 
ROWING BOAT THAT IS UNLIKELY TO 
WIN A MEDAL THE GOLD MEDAL HAS TO 
COME FROM THE EIGHT THEY WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT SILVER 
SOUNDS GOOD BUT YOU HAVE GOT THE 
AUSTRALIANS AND THE CHINESE WHO 
DIDN'T MAKE THE FINAL LAST YEAR 
YOU HAVE GOT THE AMERICANS AND THE 
CANADIANS TO COME INTO THAT EVENT 
THEY WILL BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT 
I THINK THE AUSTRALIANS UNDER 
CHINESE ARE QUICKER THAN THEY WERE 
LAST YEAR'S SIDE MAY NOT BE AS DOOM 
AND GLOOM AS IT LOOKS AT FIRST 
THOUGHTS 
ALEX PARTRIDGE HAS NOT THOUGHTS HAD HIS TROUBLES WHEN IT COMES TO 
SELECTION HAS CERTAINLY HAD 
TROUBLES HE IS MAKING THE BEST OF 
THIS BY GOING INTO THE EIGHT 
TALKING ENTHUSIASTICALLY HOW DO 
YOU READ HIS THOUGHTS PERCEIVE HIS 
FEELINGS 
HE IS GOING TO BE FEELINGS DEVASTATED AT NOT BEING IN THE FOUR 
IT HAS BEEN HIS DRIVE FOR THE PAST 
FIVE OR SIX YEARS AND NOT GOING TO 
ATHENS WITH A PUNCTURED LUNG WAS 
DEVASTATING TO COME BACK AND THEN 
BECOME WORLD CHAMPION IN THE 
COXLESS FOUR AND BUILD UP HE HAS 
AT VARIOUS INJURIES ALONG THE WAY 
I SAW HIM IN JANUARY AND HE WAS 
PLEASED WITH THE WAY EVERYTHING WAS 
GOING THE PERFORMANCE ON THE 
ROWING MACHINES AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
WAS REALLY GOOD AND HE WAS VERY 
CONFIDENT THAT HE WAS IN HIS BEST 
CONDITION AND THEN NOT GETTING 
INTO THE ALL WAS DEVASTATING BUT 
RUMOUR HAS IT THAT IT IS GOING WELL 
IT IS TEN OR TWELVE OF THEM THAT COULD 
MAKE THAT BOAT STRONG FINGERS FINGERS CROSSED FOR ALEX PARTRIDGE A ROW 
WOULD LOVE TO SEE HIM HAVE AN 
OLYMPIC GOLD 
BACK TO SCULLING AND WE ARE GOING 
TO SEE THE MEN'S DOUBLE SCULLS AND 
THE SINGLES WHICH FEATURES 
NORTHERN IRELAND'S ALAN CAMPBELL 
HE TURNED TWENTY FIVE YESTERDAY AND WAS 
DETERMINED TO GIVE HIMSELF THE 
PRESENT TODAY 
THE PLAN IS TO BUILD UP THROUGH THE 
WORLD CUP SEASON AND BEING THE BEST 
SHAPE WE CAN BEFORE THE OLYMPICS 
BELIEVE WE ARE GOING ABOUT THAT THE 
RIGHT WAY THIS YEAR AND TO BE ON 
US THE SEMI WAS VERY GOOD 
INDICATION THAT THINGS HAVE BEEN 
GOING WELL FOR ME AND I AM LOOKING 
FORWARD TO THE FINAL TOMORROW AND 
IF I WIN YOU CAN BUY ME BEER ALAN CAMPBELL MOVES INTO THE FRONT 
FIVE CHASED BY A THE ROLLER FROM 
THE TANG REPUBLIC THE NORWEGIAN 
ALSO HAS GREAT FORM AT THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS HE PARTICULARLY IS 
THE OLYMPIC CHAMPION LET'S SEE AS 
THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED DEVELOPS THE TWO TIME WORLD CHAMPION THE 
FAVOURITE FOR THE OLYMPICS MIGHT BE 
ON THE BICYCLES BEHIND 
THEY WILL 
BE ON THE RADIO GIVING THEM A 
REPORT ON HOW THEY ARE GOING ALAN 
CAMPBELL WAS VERY QUICK IN THE 
WORLD CUP LAST YEAR AND EVERYBODY 
HAS BEATEN EVERYBODY IN THESE RACES 
ALAN CAMPBELL HAS BEATEN EVERYBODY 
IN THE SEASON LAST YEAR AND AT THE 
MOMENT HERE HE IS IN AN EXCELLENT 
POSITION TO TAKE THIS FIRST WORLD 
CUP 
ALMOST A LENGTH SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY METRES TO CUP GO HE NEEDS TO BREAK OUT OVER THE 
NEXT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YOU CAN GET OUT INTO 
CLEAR WATER BREAK CLEAR OF THE 
ATHLETE FROM THE CZECH REPUBLIC 
THAT WOULD BE A PSYCHOLOGICAL A 
REALLY BIG MOVE TO EASE OUT IT IS 
ALMOST A LENGTH IF YOU HAVE GOT 
THAT OVERLAP HE KNOWS HE COULD 
PULL HIM BACK ONCE YOU GET A BIT 
OF CLEAR WATER IT IS A GREAT 
FEELING THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE 
BROKEN THEM PSYCHOLOGICALLY NOW WE 
CAN START TO MOVE ON THAT IS THE 
RACE GOING ON IN ALAN CAMPBELL'S 
HEAD AS THEY COME UP TO THE LAST 
TIMING MARK THIS IS WHERE WE WILL 
SEE ALL FOUR SCULLERS ROOM LIFT 
THEIR GAME YOU CAN SEE THE SPREAD 
HERE THE WORLD CHAMPION FROM NORWAY IS 
CURRENTLY HOLD ON TO THE BRONZE 
MEDAL IN THIRD POSITION ALAN 
CAMPBELL HAS GOT THE DISTANCE 
ALLEN HAS JUST INCREASED THE RATE 
LOOK AT HIM GO HE IS UP THE RIGHT 
NOW HE WANTS TO HANG ONTO THAT 
ALL IMPORTANT CLEAR WATER 
HE IS A 
VERY FAST FINISHER VERY STRONG IN 
THE FINISH HE HAS DONE VERY WELL 
JUST WATCHING HINT SCULLING FROM 
THE SIDE HE HAS COME FORWARD VERY 
FAST AND THAT CAN CHECK THE BOAT 
HE NEEDS TO LET IT NOT MORE BENEATH 
HIM BUT HE IS MOVING PAST HE IS 
VERY STRONG MOVING UP TOWARDS THE 
FINISH BUT THEY HAVE STILL GOT THE 
WIND ON THEIR BACKS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY METRES REMAIN THE CROWD BOTH 
SIDES OF THE LAKE ALL THE COACHES 
ON THE BIKES IN THE GRANDSTANDS 
THEY WILL BE URGING THE SCULLERS 
COME THROUGH AS ALAN CAMPBELL DONE 
ENOUGH TO HOLD OFF THEIR COMPETITOR 
FROM THE CZECH REPUBLIC INSIDE ONE HUNDRED 
METRES ALAN CAMPBELL HIS HEAD 
GOES DOWN SLIGHTLY BECAUSE NOW IT 
IS PAINFUL FIVE OR SIX STROKES REMAINING ALAN 
CAMPBELL IS HOLDING ON HE WON BY 
HALF A LENGTH CZECH REPUBLIC IN 
SECOND AND NORWAY IN THE BRONZE 
MEDAL POSITION WHAT A FABULOUS 
CLOSING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY METRES 
THAT WAS VERY 
GOOD THE MIDDLE PART WAS VERY 
IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO LAY DOWN THE 
LENGTH IT IS OMINOUS HE HAD THE 
BEST LAYING HERE THE CZECH 
REPUBLIC'S PUSHED DID EAT AWAY AT 
HIS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY METRES 
BELATED HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ISLAND 
IT LOOKS LIKE GARRY HERBERT OWES AT 
ALAN A VERY NICE BEER FOURTH PLACE IN 
MUNICH WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS LAST 
YEAR A 
YEAR A 
VERY MATURE EFFORT FROM HIM 
TODAY THE MAN FROM THE CZECH 
REPUBLIC EXERTING PRESSURE IN THE 
LAST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY METRES GOOD STUFF 
CONGRATULATIONS A GOOD WIN WHAT 
WAS THAT OUT OF YOUR SKIN ALL WAS 
THAT CONTROLLED WIN 
THAT WAS A 
REALLY TOUGH RACE WE HAVE PUT 
EVERYTHING TOGETHER BUT I HAVE NOT 
PUT EVERYTHING IN IT THAT WE HAVE 
BEEN PRACTISING THIS YEAR L. WENT 
FOR THE WIN BUT I HAVE GOT MORE TO 
COME 
HE WILL STEP FORWARD NOW AS COME WE GO TO LUCERNE YES I AM LOOKING 
FORWARD TO THAT THOSE GUYS WERE 
NOT A MILLION MILES TODAY THEY 
WERE BITING ON MY HEELS SO MY JOB 
IS TO HOLD THEM AT BAY AND SEE HOW 
MUCH DAMAGE 
I CAN PUT ON THEM NOW I HAVE COME FORTH THREE TIMES ON 
THE SLATE HERE BEFORE AND I HAVE 
ONLY BEEN THREE TIMES ON 
THIS LAKE 
GREAT BRITAIN CURRENTLY IN SECOND 
POSITION A LOT OF DEMONS TO BANISH 
ON THIS CAST BOTH GUYS ARE THREE 
TIMES THEY HAVE ROAD ON THIS COURSE 
AND THREE TIMES THEY HAVE FINISHED 
FOURTH THEY SAID LAST NIGHT IT 
WAS A 
PERSONAL 
BATTLE TO 
MOVE ON FROM 
THIS PARTICULAR REGATTA GREAT 
BRITAIN ARE REMAIN NO FIVE OUTSIDE 
THEM IN MID MAY NO SIX GERMANY 
IN LANE NUMBER SIX GERMANY ALWAYS VERY STRONG IN 
SCULLING BUT THE BARMAN IS MISSING 
A LOT OF WATER ON THE FROM STROKE 
HE ONLY REALLY PICKS UP THE STROKE 
HALFWAY THROUGH ON THE FRONT 
STROKE I THINK OF FINISHING SPURT 
COULD CARRY THEM THROUGH 
IT IS 
ABOUT CONTAINMENT NOW INTO THE 
MIDDLE PART OF THE RACE JUST 
CONTAIN MAKE SURE YOUR RHYTHM IS 
FAST MAKE SURE YOU ARE MOVING YOUR 
BOAT UP THERE IN 
NO ONE 
DEFYING ALL LOGIC AUSTRALIA ARE 
CURRENTLY IN THIRD POSITION THEY THEY ARE DOING A FANTASTIC JOB IN A LANE 
AT NUMBER ONE THAT IS WHERE THE 
WOMEN'S BRITISH DOUBLE CAME IN THE 
SEMI FINAL THEY WERE THE ONLY CREW 
TO QUALIFY FROM LANE ONE IN THE 
SEMI FINALS YESTERDAY IT IS A VERY 
DIFFICULT TASK OUT THERE IN LANE 
ONE 
NOW WE ARE STARTING TO MOVE ONE GREAT BRITAIN HAVE INCREASED THE 
PRICE AND BROUGHT IT TO ALMOST 
LEVEL INCREASED THE PACE THEY 
HAVE TIMED A GREAT RACE SO FAR AND 
NOW HERE COMES STEPHEN ROWBOTHAM 
AND MATTHEW WELLS MANY TO GET MORE 
BOAT SPEED AND BE EFFICIENT WITH IT 
THEY HAVE TAKEN ON THE GERMANS 
LED THIS RAISED RIGHT FROM THE 
START 
YES 
THE GERMANS DON'T HAVE START THE SAME FLEXIBILITY OF RATE THEY 
DID NOT RESPOND THERE AND IT WAS 
NICE TO FEEL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
RACE THAT 
WE 
COULD LOOK 
BRITISH 
DOUBLE AND 
FEEL CONFIDENT 
THEY WOULD 
BE ABLE 
TO DO SOMETHING 
IN 
THE LAST 
FIVE HUNDRED FOR FOR THEY HAVE 
TAKEN A LENGTH NOW IN ABOUT THIRTY STROKES 
JUST COMING UP TO THE LAST STROKES TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MARK JUST TWO MORE PUSHERS IT 
IS A STEP UP THEY ARE REALLY 
MOVING ON NOW THE RATE GOES AGAIN 
THERE WILL PROBABLY BE ONE MORE 
CORNER HERE BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY 
HAVE GOT THE BETTER OF THE GERMAN 
DOUBLE SCULL ON THE FAR SIDE AN 
INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE FROM THE 
AUSTRALIANS IN LANE THAT NOBLE ONE 
HERE COME THE GERMANS AGAIN AS WE 
SAID THEY WOULD THE CROWD ARE 
ROARING THEM HOME THE GERMANS ARE 
GETTING STRONGER THEY ARE COMING 
BACK IT CAN ONLY BE THREE STROKES 
REMAINING AND THE GERMANS ARE GOING 
TO COME THROUGH HAVE THE BRITISH 
GOT ENOUGH ONLY BY ABOUT THREE 
CENTIMETRES THE ROAR OF THE GERMAN 
CROWD TOOK THE CREW HOME BUT IT WAS 
NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH TODAY GREAT 
BRITAIN HANG ON FOR GOLD GERMANY 
GET THE SILVER AND AUSTRALIA GET 
THIRD THIRD THAT WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE FROM THE 
GERMANS FOR THE LAST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY METRES 
THE BRITISH DOUBLE HAD GOT THROUGH 
THREE QUARTERS OF THE LENGTH FELT 
CONFIDENT LET THEIR CONCENTRATION 
LAPSE AND THEN CAME THE SURGE FROM 
GERMANY THEY DID HOLD ON TIGHT 
FINISH 
AT ONE POINT IT WAS FINISH COMFORTABLE THEN THEY HAD US ON 
THEIR FEET GREAT BRITAIN WIND 
JUST WHEN 
IT IS A MATTER OF CENTIMETRES BUT 
HE WAS COUNTING IT IS THEIR SECOND 
SEASON TOGETHER FOURTH IN THE 
WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS LAST YEAR GOLD NOW 
I WONDER STEVE LET'S SEE FIRST 
OF ALL WE HAVE A CHAT 
WELL DONE AN IMPRESSIVE START TO 
YOUR CAMPAIGN YES IT IS GOOD TO 
FINISH WHERE WE WANTED TO LAST YEAR 
IT AT LAST YEAR'S WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AFTER A WINTER THAT 
WE HAVE HAD IT IS GOOD TO COME OUT 
ON TOP 
YOU WERE PUSHED BY THE 
GERMAN CREW IT WAS COMFORTABLE FOR 
A BIT THEN THEY CAME RIGHT BACK AT 
THE 
LINE ARE 
YOU WORRIED NOT 
NOT REALLY IT WAS EASIER THAN IT 
LOOKED I THOUGHT WE COULD HAVE 
GONE A LOT EARLIER AND PUNISHED 
THEM MORE THAN WE DID OBVIOUSLY I 
DIDN'T EXPECT 
FAST 
AT THE LAST 
MINUTE BUT 
THEY WERE 
WE ALWAYS HAD IT UNDER CONTROL 
MORE CRUISE TO COME IN THAT EVENT 
THIS SUMMER BUT HOW MUCH 
PLAYING ITS PART AS THOSE TO GEL 
TOGETHER 
THEY HAVE HAD SOME GREAT TOGETHER RESULTS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND 
THAT WILL 
BOOST THEIR 
CONFIDENCE AS 
WELL THE GERMANS 
HAVE NOT 
HAD A 
VERY GOOD 
CREW FOR 
THE LAST TWO 
YEARS 
BUT THIS 
ONE IS QUITE GOOD SO 
THEY ARE 
PUSHING THEM HARD 
SLOVENIA 
ARE THE 
STRONGEST AND THEY 
WERE ENTERED 
HERE BUT 
HAD TO PULL 
OUT 
FOR INJURY 
THEY ARE STILL TO 
COME 
IN AS 
WELL WE ARE GOING 
COME IN AS WELL WE ARE GOING TO STICK WITH THE DOUBLES IT IS LIGHTWEIGHT DOUBLES SCULLS IN A 
MOMENT FIRST 
A QUICK WORD ON ALAN 
CAMPBELL HOW WELL DO YOU THINK 
ALAN HAS IMPROVED BECAUSE HIS 
PROGRESS IS SHOWING GREAT ISN'T 
IT 
HE IS COMING ON LEAPS AND IT BOUNDS PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY EXPECT 
HIM TO DO THAT WELL THEN HE WON A 
WORLD CUP RACE AND EVERYONE THOUGHT 
HE HAD A 
CHANCE OF 
BEING A 
MEDALLIST HE 
HAS ALWAYS 
JUST 
MISSED OUT HE 
HAS WON 
WORLD CUP 
RACES BEFORE HE 
WON THIS 
ONE BUT 
THE STYLE 
HE BEAT 
THEM IN THIS YEAR 
PUTS 
HIM IN 
WITH A GOOD CHANCE 
MAY NOT WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP MEDAL 
BUT HE 
MAY WIN AN OLYMPIC MEDAL 
MERIT OF HAVING DONE IT YOURSELF 
THE HIGHS ARE REALLY HIGH BUT THE 
LOWS ARE REALLY KNOW 
IT IS THE LIGHTWEIGHT DOUBLES 
SCULLS AND WE HAVE GOT ZAC PURCHASE 
AND MARK HUNTER IN AMONGST THE 
MEDALS IN MUNICH IN LAST YEAR'S 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS THEY MADE AN 
EXCELLENT START HERE THIS TIME YES YES THEY HAD A GOOD SEASON LAST YEAR 
IN LANE FIVE 
THEY HAD A GOOD 
SEASON LAST 
IN LANE FIVE SEASON LAST 
YEAR BUT THE CREW THAT 
IS NOT HERE IS THE DANISH CREW AND 
THEY DOMINATED 
THE SEASON LAST YEAR 
THESE TO 
HAVE GOT SO MUCH POTENTIAL 
ZAC PURCHASE DID THE LIGHTWEIGHT 
SINGLES SCULL FOR 
TWO YEARS 
STRAIGHT OUT 
OF JUNIORS WON A 
SILVER 
MEDAL WON 
THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS THE YEAR 
AFTER AND 
THEN WHEN INTO THE OLYMPIC CLASS AS 
A DOUBLES SCULLER THIS PARTNERSHIP 
IS PRETTY AMAZING BUT THE DANES 
ARE THE ONES THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT 
WATCHING THEM LAST YEAR I FELT 
THIS CREW WOULD GET STRONGER AND 
STRONGER IT 
WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME 
IF THEY COULD BEAT THE DANES THESE 
GUYS CAN SCARE THEM 
I GUESS THIS 
FINISH WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN 
THEY COULD HAVE THOUGHT AT THIS 
EARLY STAGE IN PROCEEDINGS THEY THEY HAVE GOT A LOT OF CONFIDENCE THEY 
KNOW THEIR ABILITY THEY HAVE HAD 
THEIR INJURIES AND PROBLEMS BUT TO 
WIN IN THIS SORT 
OF STYLE 
IS GOING 
TO BOOST 
THEIR CONFIDENCE 
AND THEY 
CANNOT WAIT 
TO GET 
HOLD OF THE 
DANES TO RAISE THEM I'M SURE THEY 
WERE 
DANES TO RAISE THEM I'M SURE THEY WERE DELIGHTED WITH THEIR VICTORY 
CONGRATULATIONS HOW IMPRESSED WERE 
YOU WITH THE RESULT TODAY REALLY REALLY IMPRESSED IT IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN 
WORKING ON FOR THE REGATTA AND TO 
DO IT IN THE FINAL WAS JUST GREAT 
WE GOT INTO THE RHYTHM AND IT WAS FANTASTIC IT WENT ACCORDING TO FANTASTIC PLAN YES WE WORKED REALLY 
HARD IN 
PLAN THE SECOND FIVE HUNDRED IT JUST WENT 
COMPLETELY THE 
WAY WE WANTED IT 
GO AND IT WAS AN AWESOME 
COMING AWAY FROM THIS NOW AT POINT SHE WILL HAVE TO MEET THE 
CREW FROM 
DENMARK THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS 
WHAT HAVE 
YOU GUYS 
GOT TO DO TO BEAT THEM 
WE WON THIS 
BY A CONVINCING MARGIN THEY HAVE 
GOT TO BEAT US

IMAGE

CHALLENGE 
US AND 
THAT IS HOW 
WANT TO TAKE THIS FORWARD

INJURY SET KEPT SARAH WINCKLESS

EASY IN LANE TURN IN THE CHOPPY 
POSITIONS AND THEY REFLECTED ON FIFTH 
PLACE AS DECENT OUTCOME IT WAS 
CHINA'S TWO CREWS WHO COMPLETELY 
DOMINATED THIS RACE 
SO FIVE GOLD MEDALS IN TOTAL TWO 
SILVERS HOW DO YOU RATE THE 
OPENING REGATTA 
IT IS A VERY GOOD 
START WE CAME AWAY WITH SEVEN 
WORLD MEDALS IN THE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
LAST YEAR IN THE OLYMPIC EVENTS WE
