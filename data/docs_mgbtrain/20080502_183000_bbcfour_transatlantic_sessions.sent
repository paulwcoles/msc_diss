THERE'S A CROSS ABOVE THE BABY'S BED 
THE SAVIOUR IN HER DREAMS 
BUT SHE WAS NOT DELIVERED THEN 
AND THE BABY BECAME ME 
THERE'S A LIGHT INSIDE THE DARKENED ROOM 
A FOOTSTEP ON THE STAIRS 
A DOOR THAT I FOREVER CLOSE 
TO LEAVE THOSE MEMORIES THERE 
SO WHEN THE SHADOWS LINK THEM 
LEAVES HAVE TURNED TO DUST 
FIRST THERE'S SUMMER THEN I'LL LET YOU IN 
SEPTEMBER WHEN IT COMES 
I PLAN TO CRAWL OUTSIDE THESE WALLS 
CLOSE MY EYES AND SEE 
AND CRAWL INTO YOUR HEART AND ARMS 
AND TOUCH YOUR FACE AND DREAM 
I CANNOT MOVE A MOUNTAIN NOW 
I CAN NO LONGER RUN 
I CANNOT BE WHO I WAS THEN 
IN A WAY I NEVER WAS 
I WATCH THE CLOUDS GO SAILING 
I WATCH THE CLOCK AND SUN 
OH I WATCH MYSELF DEPENDING ON 
SEPTEMBER WHEN IT COMES 
SO WHEN THE SHADOWS LINK THEM 
AND BURN AWAY THE PAST 
THEY WILL FLY ME LIKE AN ANGEL 
TO A PLACE WHERE I CAN REST 
WHEN WINDS BEGIN I'LL LET YOU IN 
SEPTEMBER WHEN IT COMES 
WHEN IT COMES 
YES YES IS WHAT I SAID YES YES YES 
DOWN BY THE SALLEY GARDENS 
MY LOVE AND I DID MEET 
SHE PASSED THE SALLEY GARDENS 
WITH LITTLE SNOW WHITE FEET 
SHE BID ME TAKE LIFE EASY 
AS THE LEAVES GROW ON THE TREE 
BUT I BEING YOUNG AND FOOLISH 
WITH HER I DID NOT AGREE 
IN A FIELD BY THE RIVER IN A FIELD BY THE RIVER 
MY LOVE AND I DID STAND MY LOVE AND I DID STAND 
AND ON MY LEANING SHOULDER AND ON MY LEANING SHOULDER 
SHE PLACED HER SNOW WHITE HAND SHE PLACED HER SNOW WHITE HAND 
SHE BID ME TAKE LIFE EASY SHE BID ME TAKE LIFE EASY 
AS THE GRASS GROWS ON THE WEIR AS THE GRASS GROWS ON THE WEIR 
BUT I WAS YOUNG AND FOOLISH BUT I WAS YOUNG AND FOOLISH 
AND NOW I AM FULL OF TEARS AND NOW I AM FULL OF TEARS 
DOWN BY THE SALLEY GARDENS 
MY LOVE AND I DID MEET 
SHE PASSED THE SALLEY GARDENS 
WITH LITTLE SNOW WHITE FEET 
SHE BID ME TAKE LOVE EASY SHE BID ME TAKE LOVE EASY 
AS THE GRASS GROWS ON THE WEIR AS THE GRASS GROWS ON THE WEIR 
BUT I WAS YOUNG AND FOOLISH BUT I WAS YOUNG AND FOOLISH 
AND NOW I AM FULL OF TEARS AND NOW I AM FULL OF TEARS 
AND FOOLISH 
AND NOW I AM FULL OF TEARS
