YOUNG ERNST AND AMP YOUNG ERNST AND AMP YOUNG 
YOUNG ERNST AND AMP YOUNG ERNST AND AMP YOUNG AFTERNOON FOLKS WELCOME TO THE 
DAILY POLITICS ONCE UPON A TIME IT 
WAS EASY FOR THE LITTLE PIGS TO 
ENTER THE HUEFG MARKET BUT NOW AN 
ILL HOUSING MARKET BUT NOW AN 
ILL WIND IS BLOWING HOMEOWNERS ARE 
BEGINNING TO FEEL THE CHILL WHAT'S 
GONE WRONG WITH YOU GET INTO TROUBLE 
THE WHOLE GANG IS GOING TO COME AND 
HELP YOU YOU FEEL YOU'RE BIG 
AND EVERYTHING 
WITH US FOR THE DURATION AN OLD 
FRIEND OF THE SHOW THE FOUNDER AND 
DIRECTOR OF THE CHARITY KIDS 
COMPANY CAMILA BATMANGHELIDJH 
WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAMME 
LOVELY TO SEE YOU THANK YOU JUST JUST AS WELL WE'RE NOT IN BLACK AND 
WHITE YEAH WHITE YEAH THIS TEN P. TAX ROW WE DID IT 
YESTERDAY IT'S IN ALL THE PAPERS 
IT CONTINUES GORDON BROWN 
ADDRESSED LABOUR M. P.'S LAST NIGHT 
ALL HIS BACKBENCHERS TO TRY TO 
HEAD OFF A REBELLION OVER HIS 
DECISION AND IT WAS HIS DECISION 
TO SCRAP THE TEN P. STARTING RATE OF 
INCOME TAX DESPITE HIS CALL FOR 
PARTY UNITY REPORTED THIS MORNING 
THIRTY NINE LABOUR M. P.'S HAVE SIGNED A MOTION 
CHALLENGING EVEN ATTACKING HIS 
DECISION DECISION LET'S GO LIVE TO THE B. B. C.'S 
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT VICKI 
YOUNG IN DOWNING STREET WITH THE 
LATEST IS IT TRULY TO SAY NOW THAT 
THIS REBELLION HAS GONE BEYOND WHAT 
WE MIGHT CALL THE USUAL SUSPECTS 
YES I THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT 
WE HAVE A LIST NOW OF THE THIRTY EIGHT M. P.'S 
BACKING FRANK FIELD'S AMENDMENT 
CALLING FOR FULL COMPENSATION FOR 
THOSE WHO HAVE LOST OUT IT DOES 
MAKE INTERESTING READING THERE ARE 
SOME WHO WE MAY BE UNFAIRLY CALL 
THE USUAL SUSPECTS BUT THERE ARE 
INTERESTING NAMES WE HAVE JANET 
ANDERSON A FORMER MINISTER UNDER 
TONY BLAIR INTERESTINGLY OVER THE 
DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER PEOPLE SHOULD 
BE HELD FOR TWENTY EIGHT DAYS WITHOUT CHARGE 
SHE WAS SOMEBODY WHO TRIED TO FIND 
A COMPROMISE SO SHE'S NOT A NORMAL 
PERSON YOU WOULD EXPECT TO BE 
REBELLING LIKE THAT ANOTHER NAME 
IS KAREN BUCK NOT WHAT WE WOULD 
CALL A USUAL SUSPECT IT'S 
INTERESTING WE HAVE PEOPLE LIKE 
THAT OF COURSE THE REBELLION IS 
STILL GOING ON DESPITE GORDON 
BROWN LAST NIGHT SPEAKING TO THE 
PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY THOSE 
WHO WERE THERE SAID HIS TONE WAS 
MORE EMOLLIENT THEY FEEL HE'S 
MOVING A CERTAIN WAY BUT AT THE 
MOMENT THERE'S STILL NO 
COMPENSATION ON THE TABLE FRANK 
FIELD PUT IT NICELY WHEN HE SAID 
EVEN MARIE ANTOINETTE OFFERED 
PEOPLE CAKE 
YOU CAN TELL FRANK 
THAT'S JUST A FAIRYTALE BUT LET'S 
NOT GO TO FRENCH HISTORY IS IT 
TRUE THAT BECAUSE THIS HAS TURNED 
OUT TO BE A VERY UNPOPULAR THING 
WITH THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL THERE'S 
PARTICULAR ANXIETY AMONG LABOUR M. P.'S 
IN MARGINAL SEATS 
I THINK IT'S 
ALWAYS FAIR TO SAY THAT M. P.'S ARE 
GOING TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR 
FUTURES OF COURSE THEY ARE THERE 
ARE ELECTIONS LOCAL ELECTIONS 
COMING UP NEXT WEEK THAT'S GOT TO 
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT IT'S 
ALSO THE GENERAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE 
PEOPLE ARE FEELING WORSE OFF IF 
YOU'RE FROM A POORER FAMILY AND YOU 
LOOK AT YOUR PAY PACKET THIS WEEK 
AND YOU'RE WORSE OFF THAN YOU WERE 
LAST MONTH YOU'RE GOING TO CLEARLY 
QUESTION WHAT'S GOING ON THE 
CABINET TODAY WAS DOMINATED BY THE 
ECONOMIC SITUATION THE MESSAGE 
FROM GEOFF HOON THE CHIEF WHIP 
SAID MINISTERS HAVE TO GO OUT THERE 
AND STATE THEIR CASE TALK ABOUT 
THE TAX CREDITS WINTER FUEL 
ALLOWANCE THINGS THEY'VE DONE TO 
HELP THE POOREST FAMILIES AN 
UNDERSTANDING IN A WAY THAT 
MINISTERS HAVE NOT BEEN TAKING THE 
MESSAGE OUT 
TELL THEM IF THEY WANT 
TO COME AND GIVE THEIR CASE WE'RE 
ALWAYS HEERL THEY'RE NOT THAT KEEN 
TO COME ON AND BE GRILLED IN THE 
DAILY POLITICS IF THEY WANT TO PUT 
UP THEY SHOULD PUT UP OR SHUT UP 
JUST BEFORE WE CAME ON AIR A SENIOR 
TORY FRONT BENCHER SAID TO ME THAT 
DESPITE THE REBELLION HE STILL 
THOUGHT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD WIN 
THIS WHAT'S YOUR ASSESSMENT I I THINK THE KEY THING IS OVER THE 
NECK FEW DAYS WHETHER THE 
GOVERNMENT DOES COME UP WITH ANY 
MONEY ON THE TABLE IF YOU LIKE 
ANY COMPENSATION BUT I THINK THE 
MESSAGE FROM THE WHIPS TO LABOUR 
M. P.'S WILL BE DO YOU REALLY WANT TO 
VOTE DOWN A LABOUR BUDGET THREE 
DAYS BEFORE THERE'S ELECTIONS AND 
POSSIBLY PUT GORDON BROWN'S 
LEADERSHIP ON THE LINE YOU WONDER 
IF THAT WILL FOCUS THE MINDS OF M. P.'S 
AND GET THEM TO DRAW BACK FROM THE 
PRECIPICE PRECIPICE THANK YOU FOR THAT UPDATE IT'S 
STILL THE BIG TALKING ABOUT 
IT IS 
HITTING HOME CAMILA AS WAS SAID 
THERE GORDON BROWN KEEN TO POINT 
OUT THAT OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS 
LABOUR HAS REDISTRIBUTED TO THE 
POOR IN EFFECT IT'S JUST THIS 
LATEST MOVE THAT DOESN'T DO THAT 
WHAT'S YOUR READING OF HOW LABOUR 
HAS TREATED THE POOR OVER THE 
YEARS 
I THINK GORDON BROWN'S YEARS INTENTIONS ARE VERY GOOD I'M 
BAFFLED BY THIS MOVE I'M ALSO 
REASSURED THAT SO MANY M. P.'S ARE 
RISING UP AND OBJECTING TO IT WE 
SHOULD BE HAPPY THAT POLITICS IS 
ALIVE AND THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE 
LABOUR PARTY WHO WERE BRAVE ENOUGH 
TO OBJECT 
IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING 
TO DO WITH THE LOCAL ELECTIONS 
AROUND THE CORNER IN THEIR 
CONSTITUENTS GETTING UNEASY L. ALWAYS 
I ALWAYS WANT TO FIND THE ALWAYS BEST IN PEOPLE IF I CAN I'M HOPING 
THIS OBJECTION IS ASPIRATIONAL 
RATHER THAN CLIMBING A CAREER 
LADDER 
DO YOU THINK FROM WHAT LADDER YOU'VE HEARD THAT THE REBELS ARE 
GOING TO WIN DO YOU THINK THAT 
WOULD BE A GOOD THING IN THIS CASE 
I THINK GORDON BROWN IS GOING TO 
HAVE TO COME UP WITH A COMPROMISE 
IT'S A QUESTION OF HOW QUICKLY THEY 
CAN DO THEIR FIGURES L. THINK 
SOMETHING WENT WRONG SOMEONE 
DIDN'T SEE THIS THROUGH PROPERLY 
AND IT'S COMING BACK TO HAUNT HIM 
S. N. L. YES 
TIME FOR OUR DAILY QUIZ S. N. L. YES AND WE GET TO SEE HOW MUCH YOU KNOW 
ABOUT BRITAIN'S GREAT TRADITION OF 
PHILANTHROPY PHILANTHROPY THE QUESTION TODAY IS 
HOPEFULLY AT THE END OF THE 
PROGRAMME CALM WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE 
US THE CORRECT ANSWER REMEMBER 
THIS IS JUST FOR FUN NO MUGS ON 
OFFER TODAY BUT LIKE LOT ELSE 
THIS QUIZ IS ON OUR WEBSITE IF YOU 
WANT TO SEND US YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT 
ANY OF OUR STORIES GET EMAILING 
THERE WILL BE MUGS TOMORROW THOUGH 
THERE WILL BE THERE WILL BE MUGS TOMORROW 
JUST DANGLE THAT IN FRONT TOMORROW OF THE VIEWERS 
LIKE JAM AS IF 
GORDON BROWN DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TO 
WORRY ABOUT WHAT WITH POTENTIAL 
BACKBENCH REBELLIONS AND QUESTIONS 
OVER HIS LEADERSHIP HE ALSO HAS TO 
CONTEND WITH THE POLITICAL FALL OUT 
OF A SLUMP OR POTENTIAL SLUMP IN 
THE HOUSING MARKET PRICES ARE 
BEGINNING TO DRIFT DOWN BUT IT'S 
NOT YET A SLUMP CHANCELLOR 
ALASTAIR DARLING IS MEETING 
MORTGAGE LENDERS THIS AFTERNOON 
HE'S GOING TO URGE THEM TO DO MORE 
TO HELP STRUGGLING BORROWERS 
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY MOVE FROM 
FAVOURABLE TERMS TO LESS FAVOURABLE 
TERMS HOW BAD IS THE THE CURRENT 
SITUATION FOR MORTGAGE OWNERS HERE 
IS JENNY WITH A TALE OF WOE 
YES ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WERE 
FOUR LITTLE PIGS WHO DECIDED TO BUY 
SMART NEW HOMES THE FIRST LITTLE 
PIG BOUGHT A FINE STRAW HOUSE BUT 
WAS DISMAYED TO FIND ITS VALUE WAS 
DROPPING 
DROPPING THE HALIFAX HAS REPORTED 
THAT HOUSE PRICES FELL BY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
NATIONWIDE LAST MONTH SO THIS 
LITTLE PIG BECAME TRAPPED BY 
NEGATIVE EQUITY IN OTHER WORDS 
HIS MORTGAGE WAS BIGGER THAN THE 
VALUE OF HIS HOME MORGAN STANLEY 
IS FORECASTING TWELVE MILLION 
HOUSEHOLDERS COULD BE CAUGHT BY 
THAT TRAP BY THE END OF THE YEAR 
THINGS WERE WORSE FOR THE SECOND 
LITTLE PIG WHO BOUGHT A FINE HOUSE 
MADE OF STICKS ONLY TO HAVE IT 
REPOSSESSED BY THE BIG BAD WOLF 
THE COUNCIL OF MORTGAGE LENDERS ARE 
PREDICTING THAT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND 
REPOSSESSIONS WILL TAKE 
LAST YEAR AND IT WOULD BE THE 
HIGHEST NUMBER SINCE THE EARLY 
NINETEEN NINETIES NINETEEN NINETIES THE THIRD LITTLE PIG WAS ON 
SLIGHTLY FIRMER FOUNDATIONS HE 
BOUGHT A RATHER UPMARKET HOUSE MADE 
OF BRICKS BUT LIKE MILLIONS OF 
OTHERS WHEN HE CAME TO REMORTGAGE 
HE FOUND HE HAD TO PAY A HIGHER 
RATE THAN HE HAD INTENDED 
THE FOURTH LITTLE PIG MEAN WHIEL 
COULDN'T EVEN BUY A HOUSE HE 
LACKED CAPITAL HE HAD HOPED TO GET 
A ONE HUNDRED PER CENT MORTGAGE BUT SADLY FOR HIM 
THOSE AREN'T AVAILABLE ANY MORE 
SO IT HAS BEEN A TALE OF WOE FOR 
OUR AS SPIRING YOUNG PIGS AND 
THEY'RE HOPING THE CHANCELLOR AND 
MORTGAGE LENDERS CAN AGREE ON WAYS 
TO HELP THEM TODAY I'M JOINED BY 
SCOTT PEARSON FROM MANCHESTER WHO 
IS A HOMEOWNER AND WORRIED ABOUT 
HIS MORTGAGE 
YOU BOUGHT A HOUSE LAST YEAR I 
UNDERSTAND AND YOU HAD TO GET A 
MORTGAGE BIGGER THAN THE VALUE OF 
YOUR HOME 
THAT'S RIGHT 
WE TOOK A MORTGAGE AT ONE HUNDRED FIVE PER CENT 
WHY ARE 
YOU WORRIED NOW 
WE TOOK A FIXED 
RATE PRODUCT WHICH IS DUE TO EXPIRE 
IN FEBRUARY 
AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO NEED NINETY FIVE PER CENT OR 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT WITH A LOT OF MORTGAGE 
LENDERS DISCONTINUING THIS WE MIGHT 
BE IN A POSITION WHERE WE CAN'T GET 
A MORTGAGE WITH ANOTHER LENDER SO 
WE'RE FORCED TO STAY ON WITH 
NORTHERN ROCK WHO MIGHT PUSH THE 
RATES UP OR WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE 
TO REMORTGAGE AT ALL 
SO DOES THAT LEAVE YOU WITH 
PRESUMABLY THE DANGER OF HAVING TO 
SELL YOUR HOME OR HAVE IT 
REPOSSESSED IF YOU CAN'T KEEP UP 
THE PAYMENTS 
POTENTIALLY WE'RE 
LED TO BELIEVE THAT NORTHERN ROCK 
ARE DISCOURAGING CUSTOMERS 
REMORTGAGING WITH THEM PUSHING 
THEM TO REMORTGAGE WITH ANOTHER 
COMPANY WHAT WE POTENTIALLY HAVE 
IS IF WE CAN'T GET A MORTGAGE WITH 
ANOTHER LENDER WE HAVE TO STAY WITH 
NORTHERN ROCK AND PAY A HIGHER RATE 
POTENTIALLY INCREASING OUR MONTHLY 
OUTGOING UP TO TWO HUNDRED A MONTH WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE REALISTICALLY TO 
SEE THE CHANCELLOR DO TODAY I I THINK PEOPLE IN OUR CIRCUMSTANCES 
REALLY WOULD LIKE SOME SORT OF 
GUARANTEE THAT IF YOU NEED A NINETY FIVE PER CENT OR 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT MORTGAGE THEN ONE IT'S 
AVAILABLE TO YOU BUT ALSO IT'S 
AVAILABLE AT A REASONABLE AND MORE 
IMPORTANTLY AN AFFORDABLE RATE 
THAT COULD BE DONE BY MAKING SURE 
MORTGAGE LENDERS DON'T TAKE 
ADVANTAGE AND PUSH THEM INTEREST 
RATES UP 
DO YOU THINK THAT IS THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT 
AND THE MORTGAGE LENDERS OR IS IT 
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR HAVING 
TAKEN OUT SUCH A HUGE MORTGAGE IN 
THE FIRST PLACE YOU MUST HAVE 
KNOWN THAT TAKING OUT A MORTGAGE 
OVER ONE HUNDRED PER CENT WAS A RISKY THING TO DO 
AT THE TIME THE PROFESSIONAL ADVICE 
WE WERE GIVEN WAS THAT IT WAS A 
RISK HOWEVER IT WAS CALCULATED 
AND MANAGEABLE RISK FOR EXAMPLE 
I'M RECENT GRADUATE MY SALARY 
INCREASES OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS 
WE KNEW AT THE TIME IT WAS 
SOMETHING AFFORDABLE AGAIN WHEN 
WE DO REMORTGAGE IT WILL BE 
AFFORDABLE BUT IT WILL BE VERY 
DIFFICULT DIFFICULT THANK YOU VERY MUCH DIFFICULT 
FOR MOST OF US HOUSING OUR HOMES 
ARE THE BIGGEST ATE SET WE'LL OWN 
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POLITICAL AND 
ECONOMIC ISSUE WE'RE JOINED BY THE 
FORMER CONSERVATIVE CHANCELLOR KEN 
CLARKE WHO HAS SEEN A FEW HOUSING 
CRISIS HIMSELF WELCOME BACK WHEN 
SOMEBODY SAYS I WANT A ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
MORTGAGE AND THE BANK OR BUILDING 
SOCIETY SAYS HAVE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PER CENT WHO'S TO 
BLAME ME FOR ASKING FOR IT AND 
TAKING IT OR THE BANK FOR OFFERING 
IT 
I PUT MOST OF THE BLAME ON THE IT BANK 
THEY SHOULDN'T OFFER THESE BANK KIND OF THINGS 
THE GUY WE'VE BEEN 
TALKING TO HE'S A VICTIM OF CRAZY 
IRRESPONSIBLE LENDING 
BUT NOT 
IRRESPONSIBLE BORROWING 
HE SHOULD 
HAVE REALISED HE WAS TAKING A BIG 
RISK WHAT BOTH WERE ACTING ON WAS 
THE BELIEF THAT IT WILL BE ALL 
RIGHT BECAUSE HOUSE PRICES ALWAYS 
GALLON UP 
TREES WILL GROW TO THE 
SKY 
HE'LL HAVE A TRICK YIM COUPLE SKY OF YEARS AND THEN IT WILL BE ALL 
RIGHT BECAUSE THE HOUSE WILL HAVE 
GOT MORE VALUABLE MOST SENSIBLE 
PEOPLE WERE WARNING FOR A LONG TIME 
THAT WASN'T THE CASE WE WERE IN 
THE MIDDLE OF A BUBBLE ALL 
WARNINGS WERE IGNORED 
AND BUBBLES 
BURST EVENTUALLY YEAH 
TAKING THE YEAH CASE OF PEOPLE IN HIS PREDICAMENT 
AND THERE ARE MANY OTHERS OF 
VARIATIONS THE GOVERNMENT YOU 
COULD SAY HAS DONE ITS BIT NOW BY 
GETTING THE BANK OF ENGLAND TO 
IMPROVE THE LIQUIDITY OF THE 
BANKING SYSTEM HOPING THERE WILL 
BE BE MORE MONEY AROUND SO 
MORTGAGES DON'T DRY UP BUM OTHER 
THAN THAT SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT 
REALLY BE INVOLVED IN THE DETAIL OF 
MORTGAGES SHOULD IT BE DOING 
THINGS TO STOP REPOSSESSION SHOULD 
IT BE LEANING ON THE MORTGAGE 
LENDERS NOT TO DO WHAT THEY'LL BE 
DOING TO THAT YOUNG MAN DEFINITELY DEFINITELY NOT FIRST OF ALL WHAT THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS DONE ISN'T GOING TO 
TRANSFORM THE SITUATION IT 
PROBABLY WON'T HELP THAT GUY AT ALL 
THEY'RE BOUND TO GO ON SAYING THE 
BANK SHOULD PASS ALL THE BENEFIT ON 
BUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS JUST 
ENABLING THE BANKS TO KEEP IN 
BUSINESS LENDING TO ANYBODY THE 
LENDING THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE AS 
THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
WAS SAYING SHOULD BE WITH A DEPOSIT 
LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF THE VALUE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT MORTGAGES ARE OVER NOW AREN'T 
THEY ABSOLUTELY 
THAT'S A GOOD THEY ABSOLUTELY THING 
IT'S A GOOD THING THE THING SUPPOSEDLY STRINGENT CONDITIONS FOR 
NEW MORTGAGES ARE COMMON SENSE 
THAT SHOULD ALWAYS PREVAIL L. HOPE 
IT'S MANY YEARS BEFORE WE GO BACK 
TO ONE OF THESE MAD BUBBLES 
MEANWHILE AND HE HAS TO SHOW HIS 
CONCERN I'M SURE HE IS CONCERNED 
BUT HE CAN'T ACTUALLY CONTROL 
ANYTHING HE WILL A HE GET THEM TO 
AGREE ON GOOD PRACTICE ONCE YOU 
GET REPOSSESSIONS GOING UP IT 
DOESN'T PAY THE BUILDING SOCIETY TO 
TAKE ALL THESE HOUSES THEY CAN'T 
SELL 
THEY DON'T SHOW UP AS SELL VALUABLE ON THEIR BALANCE SHEELTS 
SAY COULD YOU JUST PAY THE 
INTEREST ONLY FOR A A BIT 
SO THE 
LENDERS SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WAYS 
TO AMELIORATE 
I HOPE SOME GOOD 
NEWS COMES OUT FOR BORROWERS IT'S 
IN THE BANKS' OWN INTERESTS TO DO 
THAT IT'S NO USE GETTING THOUSANDS 
OF HOUSES 
IN YOUR JUDGMENT HOW 
BAD IS THE HOUSING MARKET SITUATION 
AT THE MOMENT 
SORRY I DON'T KNOW 
IF YOU HAVE AN EXPERT ON HERE WHO 
GIVES YOU A FIGURE HE'S TALKING 
NONSENSE I WAS AT A HIGH POWERED 
CONFERENCE YESTERDAY AND NOBODY 
REALLY KNOWS L. THINK HOUSE PRICES 
WILL FALL FURTHER I DON'T THINK 
THEY'LL FALL AS FAR AS THEY HAVE IN 
AMERICA IN AMERICA THEY HAVE A 
SURPLUS OF SUPPLY BECAUSE OF OUR 
PLANNING RULES WE DON'T 
WE DON'T WANT FIRST TIME BUYERS MY 
ADVICE TO A FIRST TIME BUYERS IS 
NOT TO BE ENCOURAGED BY THE 
POLITICIANS DON'T BUY RENT FOR A 
BIT THE HOUSE WILL BE CHEAPER IN 
TWELVE MONTHS' TIME AND A MORTGAGE WILL 
BE EASIER TO GET AND THAT MIGHT BE 
CHEAPER AS WELL 
YOU WERE PART OF A TORY GOVERNMENT 
THAT WENT THROUGH PERIOD OF 
MASSIVE REPOSSESSIONS IT IS 
POLITICALLY TOXIC FOR GOVERNMENT 
TO PRESIDE OVER A PERIOD OF 
REPOSSESSIONS 
IT WAS DISASTROUS REPOSSESSIONS POLITICALLY AS WELL QUITE RIGHTLY 
IT WENT BACK TO MISTAKES MADE IN 
THE LATE EIGHTIES WE CUT INTEREST 
RATES WHEN WE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE 
THE POLITICAL POISONS STAYED THERE 
FOR A WHILE AND ONE THING ALISTAIR 
MIGHT DO IS RESIST DAFT IDEAS THAT 
WERE BEING PUT TO ME ALL THE TIME 
THAT WOULDN'T DO ANY GOODS THE 
LAST THING WE WANT IS TO RECREATE 
THE HAPPY DAYS FOUR THEY ARE LENDING 
MONEY AND WE GO BACK TO 
IRRESPONSIBLE LENDING 
I'M SORRY 
FOR THE VICTIMS BUT NO MORE STUPID 
SUBSIDIES FOR PEOPLE TO BUY HOUSES 
THEY CANNOT AFFORD THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH MUCH IF I ASK YOU IF YOU'VE HAD 
POSTCODE BEEF AM I OFFERING YOU 
SOMETHING FROM THE NEAREST 
RESTAURANT RESTAURANT I'M SORRY I HAVE COUGH 
ARE YOU 
ALL RIGHT L. AM ASKING IF YOU'VE 
HAD AGGRESSIVE CONFRONTATIONS WITH 
OTHERS BECAUSE YOU HAVE STRAYED ON 
TO THEIR TURF IT IS SAID THAT MUCH 
OF THE VIOLENCE ON OUR STREETS 
COMES FROM GANGS OF YOUNGSTERS 
DEFENDING THEIR PATCHES 
IS THIS REALITY FOR MOST YOUNG KIDS 
IN BRITAIN TODAY GYLSE HAS BEEN ON 
A FOOTBALL PITCH TO FIND OUT 
FOURTEEN YEARS AGO NO AMOUNT OF RUNNING 
COULD SAVE A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD CALLED 
RICHARD EVERETT IN THE WRONG PLACE 
AT THE WRONG TIME HE WAS MURDERED 
BY A GANG A YEAR LATER CAMDEN 
UNITED FOOTBALL TEAM WAS BROURN OUT 
OF THE VIOLENCE SOME OF THOSE WHO 
PLAY TODAY ALONGSIDE EACH OTHER 
WOULD NEVER HAVE TALKED TO EACH 
OTHER ON THE STREET UNLESS TO 
SQUARE UP OR STRIKE IN A DIFFERENT 
WAY THESE YOUNG PEOPLE KNOW THE 
REALITY OF GANG SOCIETY 
THERE ARE 
GANGS AROUND EVERYWHERE YOU G. AND 
THEY'RE DIFFERENT GANGS THERE THERE COULD BE A NUMBER OF REASONS 
POVERTY TO NO ACTIVITIES AROUND 
THAT AREA OR JUST FAMILY LIFE 
MAYBE THERE ARE SOME KIDS WHO FEEL 
LIKE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE 
IN SOCIETY SO MAYBE THEY JUST STICK 
WITH WHAT THEY KNOW AND WHO THEY 
KNOW AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS FROM 
THERE 
USUALLY IT'S THE BOND IF THERE YOU'RE YOUR ONE BACKGROUND OR LIVE 
IN ONE AREA ONE ESTATE OR STREET 
THAT'S HOW YOU'RE VIEWED AT AND AND THEY THINK IF YOU GET INTO TROUBLE 
THE WHOLE GANG IS GOING TO COME AND 
HELP YOU SO YOU START TO FEEL LIKE 
YOU'RE BIG AND EVERYTHING IT'S 
DEFINITELY ABOUT GETTING RESPECT 
EVERY POSTCODE WANTS RESPECT 
RESPECT IS I'M BETTER THAN YOU 
DON'T COME TO ME AND MESS WITH ME 
OR SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO YOU 
EVERYONE CARRIES A KNIFE TO GET 
RESPECT 
IT'S EASY TO GET A KNIFE RESPECT GO TO A KITCHEN AND IT'S EASY TO 
GET GUNS AS WELL I'D RATHER 
EVERYBODY PUT THE GUNS DOWN BUT 
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IT'S 
OFTEN JUST FRONT TALK BUT THERE 
ARE GUNS OUT THERE 
ONCE EVERYONE 
GROWS UP THEY CONTINUED TO COME OUT 
OF THEIR GANG MY GROUP TWO YEARS 
AGO THEY WERE RAPPING AND THINGS 
BUT EVERYONE IS FOCUSING ON SCHOOL 
NOW 
GANGS HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR NOW SEVEN YEARS BUT NOW THERE ARE MORE 
KNIVES AND PEOPLE GET MORE SCARED 
AND BECAUSE PEOPLE GET MORE SCARED 
THEY WANT TO DO MORE THINGS 
SO IT 
IS LIKE A VICIOUS CIRCLE ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR YES YES IT REALLY IS 
THE FEELING IS THAT 
POLITICIANS AND YOUNGSTERS DON'T 
REALLY INTEGRATE AS SUCH THEY 
DON'T GET ALONG AS SUCH YOU CAN'T 
SEE THEM TOGETHER 
YOU WOULDN'T 
MIND SEEING ONE DOWN HERE PLAYING 
FOOTBALL WOULD YOU 
YES I 
WOULDN'T MIND 
FOOTBALL IS A GOOD 
WAY OF LINKING PEOPLE AND KEEPING 
THEM OFF THE STREETS WHERE THERE 
COULD TROUBLE 
SO BY THE TIME 
YOU LEAVE YOU'RE FEELING SO 
KNACKERED YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO DO 
ANYTHING WOULD YOU 
EXACTLY I'LL 
GO HOME AND EAT SOMETHING 
CAMILLA YOU SPEND MUCH OF YOUR 
LIFE DEALING WITH THESE THINGS AND 
MANY CHILDREN END UP IN GANGS CAN 
WE GET SOME PERSPECTIVE ON THIS WE 
SEEM TO THINK GANG CULTURE IS MORE 
PREVENTANT IN CERTAIN AREAS IS IT 
TRUE IT IS WORSE THAN BEFORE I I THINK THE VIOLENCE IS MORE 
PREVALENT SO WHEREAS YOU WOULD BE 
HARD PRESSED TO FIND FIREARMS IN 
THE HANDS OF SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS 
NOW IT IS MUCH MORE COMMON TO HAVE 
A FIGHT AND PUNCH SOMEONE IS ONE 
LEVEL TO STAND AT A DISTANCE AND 
SHOOT SOMEONE AND BE THAT REMOVED 
IS ANOTHER LEVEL THE OTHER ISSUE 
ARE DRUG DEALERS 
THEY'RE USING THE 
GANGS 
THE KIDS NOT NECESSARILY GANGS THE KIDS IN IN PROGRAMME BUT THE 
CENTRAL DUG DEALER TAKES THE 
CHILDREN WITHOUT COMPETENT PARENTS 
AND GETS THEM TO RUN THE TRADE FOR 
HIM AND THEN THOSE CHILDREN LEARN 
A LOT OF VIOLENCE AND THEN THEY 
FORCE YOUR KIND OF CHILDREN TO 
BECOME MORE VIOLENT IN ORDER TO 
SURVIVE THEM 
WE SHOULD SAY THAT 
THE CHILDREN ON THAT FILM WERE THE 
ONES WHO SEEMED TO HAVE AVOIDED A 
LOT OF THE GANG CULTURE AND DOING 
PRETTY WELL OR THE BEST THEY CAN 
IN DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES 
ABSOLUTELY 
BUT I WONDER TOO FOR ABSOLUTELY THE KIDS WHO END UP IN GANGS SOME 
WILL JOIN GANGS BECAUSE THEY FEEL 
SAFER ABOUT DOING SO WHEN THEY 
FEEL THREATENED BUT THESE ARE 
PROBABLY KIDS THAT HAVE PROBABLY 
BEEN FAILED BY THEIR PARENTS 
SCHOOL AND NEIGHBOURHOOD AND THE 
GANG IN A WAY IS NINE FIRST 
INSTITUTION THAT IN A WAY THEY 
CAN COUNT ON 
AND IT IS THE FIRST 
CREDIT RATING THEY HAVE EVERYWHERE 
ELSE THEY FEEL POWERLESS AND FEEL 
THEY CAN'T MOBILISE SOCIETY FOR 
THEIR NEEDS BUT BY USING VIOLENCE 
SUDDENLY THEY HAVE A SENSE OF 
POTENCY AND A WAY TO CHANGE THEIR 
OWN LIVES ALBEIT IN A NEGATIVE WAY 
SO MUCH OF IT IS ABOUT LACK OF CARE 
WHEN I WAS YOUNG WE WERE 
FRIGHTENED OF GANGS WE DIDN'T 
HAVE KNIVES OR GUNS BUT WE WERE 
FRIGHTENED OF THEM AND A LOT OF 
KIDS TODAY ARE FRIGHTENED OF GANGS 
AREN'T THEY 
THEY ARE VERY 
FRIGHTENED AND SOME PARENTS IN 
SOME NEIGHBOURHOODS ARE ADVISING 
KIDS TO JOIN A GANG IN ORDER FOR 
THE CHILD TO BE SAFE REALLY AND REALLY AND THE PROBLEM IS THE POLICE ARE NOT 
ABLE TO BRING ABOUT PROSECUTIONS 
BECAUSE THE KIDS ARE TOO FRIGHTENED 
TO GIVE EVIDENCE BECAUSE OF REVENGE 
ON THEIR FAMILIES 
IN THESE 
NEIGHBOURHOODS 
IN THESE NEIGHBOURHOODS NEIGHBOURHOODS SO THE LEGAL 
STRUCTURE IS NOT PROTECTING THESE 
CHILDREN AND THE VIOLENT 
INDIVIDUALS AT STREET LEVEL SEEM TO 
HAVE ALL THE POWER SO YOU MIGHT AS 
WELL JOIN THEM OR YOU ARE GOING TO 
BE THEIR VICTIMS AND THIS IS WHAT 
IS HAPPENING TO THE KIDS 
WHEN YOU 
DEAL WITH THESE KIDS YOU MUST FEEL 
IT IS A CONSTANT MOUNTAIN YOU ARE 
CLIMBING 
YOU KNOW WHAT IS VERY CLIMBING MOVING THEY WANT TO AS THEY SAY BE 
LEGIT EIGHTY PER CENT OF OUR KIDS GO BACK 
INTO EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT BUT 
YOU NEED TO PUT THE RESOURCES IN 
AND HOUSING IS A VERY BIG PROBLEM 
EIGHTY PER CENT OF OUR CHILDREN THAT ARRIVE 
HAVE NOWHERE TO LIVE SO WE NEED TO 
FIND SOMEWHERE FOR THEM TO LIVE AND 
STABILISE THEM BEFORE WE CAN 
EDUCATE THEM IT IS NOT ROCKET 
SCIENCE BUT IT REQUIRES RESOURCES 
AND HARD WORK AND THAT IS WHAT THE 
ADULTS ARE AVOIDING 
WELL LET'S 
HOPE SOME SEE THIS AND STOP IT YES YES LOTS OF REACTION TO THIS PETER 
PALMER SUGGESTS THAT ALISTAIR 
DARLING SIMPLY INCREASES THE TAX 
FREE PERSONAL ALLOWANCE AND THAT 
WAY TAKING SOME OF THE LOSERS OUT 
OF THE NET AND BOB SAYS BROWN IS 
AS DAMAGED BY TAKING AWAY THE TEN P. 
TAX BAND AS THATCHER WAS WITH THE 
POLL TAX 
THAT IS BAD IF THAT WAS 
TRUE THAT WOULD BE BAD 
AND GRAHAM 
SAYS THE REMOVAL OF THE TEN PER CENT BAND 
WILL BE LABOUR'S ACHILLES' HEEL 
AND REBECCA PIGEON MAKES THE POINT 
THAT HOUSE PRICES FALLING IS NOT 
ALWAYS BAD NEWS SHE SAYS 
ALTHOUGH GAMBLERS MAY BE 
DISAPPOINTED BUT SURELY THEY HAVE 
PREVENTED FIRST TIME BUYERS FROM 
ACCESSING THE MARKET FOR A LONG 
TIME NOW SO SHOULDN'T WE FROM 
THAT POINT OF VIEW WITH GLAD THAT 
THE CRASH IS APPROACHING KEEP 
YOUR OPINIONS COMING 
THE UKIP MAYOR CANDIDATE FOR LONDON 
LAUNCHED HIS BID FROM AN OPEN 
TOPPED BUS LAST WEEK HE TO 
INCREASE THE NUMBERS OF POLICE AND 
SEVERAL OTHER POLICIES GERARD 
BATTEN IS WITH US NOW YOUR CENTRAL 
PLANK IS THAT YOU WANT TO NEGOTIATE 
BRITAIN'S EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN 
UNION GIVEN THAT THE LONDON MAYOR 
HAS NO REMIT OVER THAT WHATSOEVER 
WHY SHOULD PEOPLE VOTE FOR YOU 
UKIP WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE AND I 
HELPED TO FOUND IT ON THE BASIS OF 
WITHDRAWAL FROM THE E. U. BECAUSE WE 
THINK IT IS AN ECONOMIC DISASTER 
BUT WE REALISE NOBODY WOULD VOTE ON 
A ONE PLANK POLICY PARTY SO WE HAD 
A FULL RANGE OF POLICIES IN TERMS 
OF LONDON MAYOR ABOUT EIGHTY PER CENT OF OUR 
LAWS COME FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION 
AND NOT WESTMINSTER SO I HAVE FAR 
MORE POWER AS MEP THAN 
WESTMINSTER BECAUSE I CAN VOTE 
YES OR NO 
SO WHY GIVE THAT 
UP 
THE FIRST THING I WOULD DO IS UP CLOSE DOWN KEN'S EMBASSY IN 
BRUSSELS AND ALL THE OTHERS AROUND 
THE WORLD 
AGAIN THAT HAS A AN E. U. 
HUE TO IT WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING 
ELSE 
I WOULD CUT CRIME GET ELSE TRAFFIC MOVING IN LONDON AND REDUCE 
THE TAX BURDEN ON THE TAX PAIR 
THEY ARE MY PRIORITIES AND I WILL 
CONCENTRATE ON THOSE AND ONLY SPEND 
MONEY ON ESSENTIALS FOR LONDON AND 
THE BIG BENEFITS FOR EARN 
AND LONDON IS OBVIOUSLY FAMOUSLY AN 
INCREDIBLY MULTI CULTURAL CITY 
GIVEN THAT A LOT OF LONDONERS DO 
COME FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND 
ARE IMMIGRANTS WHY ON EARTH ARE 
THEY GOING TO VOTE FOR YOU BECAUSE BECAUSE WHAT I WANT IS AN INCLUSIVE LONDON 
I DON'T BELIEVE IN MULTI CULTUREISM 
THAT IN A PRIVATE SENSE AND 
ENJOYING OTHER PEOPLE'S CUSTOMS AND 
GOING TO A WEDDING OR A PARTY BUT 
WHERE IT IS A PROBLEM IS WHEN IT 
INTRUDES INTO THE POLITICAL SPACE 
AND YOU GET PARALLEL BODIES SETING 
UP AND WE'VE SEEN THIS WITH SHARIA 
LAW I WANT ONE LANGUAGE ENGLISH 
AND YOU CAN HAVE A MULTI ETHNIC 
SOCIETY AND THAT WILL WORK FINE 
BECAUSE HUMAN BEINGS RUB ALONG 
TOGETHER BUT I'M OPPOSED TO MULTI 
CULTUREISM AND THIS IS POPULAR 
WITH A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS THEY DO 
WANT TO LIVE IN A COHESIVE SOCIETY 
AND WE ALL SIGN UP TO BASIC VALUES 
DEMOCRACY AND FREE SPEECH AND THAT 
KIND OF THING AND THAT IS WHAT I 
WANT TO PROMOTE 
CAMILLA IS THAT A 
VOTE WINNER FOR A LONDON MAYOR NO NO WHY NOT 
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS A 
NAIVE ARGUMENT YOU CANNOT DECLARE 
THE COLOUR OF A SOCIETY IT GETS 
CREATED BY THE SUM TOTAL OF THE 
PEOPLE IN THERE AND NOBODY IS 
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DICTATE WHAT 
THE CULTURE OF LONDON IS GOING TO 
BE IT IS UNREALISTIC 
IF YOU WANT 
TO EMIGRATE TO AMERICA THEY REQUIRE 
YOU TO STUDY THE CONSTITUTION AND 
UNDERSTAND IT AND PASS A TEST AND 
SWEAR ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG AND 
THEY HAVE A MULTI ETHNIC SOCIETY 
BUT THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN MULTI 
CULTUREISM AS WE DO IN THIS SOCIETY 
AND I THINK THAT IS A FAR MORE 
HEALTHRY WAY TO PROMOTE A COHESIVE 
SOCIETY BECAUSE IF YOU ARGUE FOR 
THIS AND THAT YOU END UP WITH A 
DIVISIVE SOCIETY AND WE'VE SEEN 
THAT AROUND THE WORLD WHERE THERE 
IS VIOLENCE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT AT THAT IF YOU 
WANT TO SEE A FULL LIST OF THE 
MAYORAL CANDIDATES GO TO OUR 
WEBSITE AND OUR QUIZ
