FROM THE U. K. HE FLEW OVER THE ATLANTIC TOWARDS THE AMERICAS 
HIS DESTINATION THE ARC OF ISLANDS LYING BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA 
THE CARIBBEAN 
HE'S HEADING TO ONE OF THE SOUTHERNMOST ISLANDS GRENADA 
GRENADA DOESN'T HAVE WARM AND COLD SEASONS LIKE OUR SUMMER AND WINTER 
IT'S VERY WARM ALL YEAR ROUND 
AND ANDY'S SUFFERING FROM ANOTHER FEATURE OF GRENADIAN WEATHER 
HE FEELS SO UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE THE AIR HERE IS VERY MOIST OR HUMID 
THE HUMIDITY MAKES IT FEEL HOTTER 
THAN THE TEMPERATURE OF THIRTY NINE DEGREES CELSIUS 
GRENADA DOESN'T HAVE SUMMER AND WINTER BUT IT HAS TWO SEASONS 
A DRY SEASON DECEMBER TO MAY AND A RAINY SEASON JUNE TO NOVEMBER 
ANDY'S HERE IN JULY THE MIDDLE OF THE RAINY SEASON 
SO IT LOOKS LIKE HE'LL GET WET 
BUT THE RAIN USUALLY ONLY LASTS AN HOUR 
THAT'S THE HEAVIEST SHOWER I'VE SEEN LOOK HOW MUCH WATER'S FALLEN 
UNLIKE ANDY EVERYONE WHO LIVES HERE IS PREPARED FOR THE DOWNPOURS 
THERE'S SO MUCH RAIN HERE THAT THIS FOREST IS CALLED A RAINFOREST 
IT LIES AROUND THE CRATER OF AN EXTINCT VOLCANO 
THE HOT STICKY AND DAMP CONDITIONS MIGHT NOT BE SO PLEASANT FOR ANDY 
BUT ALL THESE PLANTS LOVE IT 
GRENADA IS A GREEN FERTILE ISLAND 
WITH CASCADING WATERFALLS RIVERS AND LAKES 
THE RAINFOREST CONTAINS A VARIETY OF PLANTS AND TREES 
LIKE PALM TREES 
BAMBOO 
AND MANGO 
THE KIND OF HOT HUMID WEATHER WE FIND IN GRENADA IS CALLED TROPICAL 
SO WHICH OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE WEATHER LIKE THIS 
AROUND THE EARTH IS AN IMAGINARY LINE CALLED THE EQUATOR 
THE AREA CLOSE TO THIS FORMS A TROPICAL BELT 
MANY COUNTRIES WITHIN THIS BELT HAVE TROPICAL WEATHER 
THE RAINFORESTS OF THE FAR EAST 
SOUTHERN PARTS OF INDIA 
CENTRAL AFRICA 
SOUTH AMERICA 
AND OF COURSE THE CARIBBEAN ISLANDS LIKE GRENADA 
SO IF IT'S SO HOT AND STICKY HERE AND RAINS SO MUCH WHY COME HERE 
WELL GRENADA HAPPENS TO HAVE THE MOST FANTASTIC BEACHES 
FEELING HOT HOT HOT 
FEELING HOT HOT HOT

I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING IT'S SO HOT AND STICKY I STRUGGLE WITH IT 
WE'RE USED TO THE SUN EVERY DAY 
AND HERE IN GRENADA NOBODY LIVES MORE THAN SIX MILES FROM THE SEA 
SO THERE'S ALWAYS THIS BREEZE THAT KEEPS THE SUN UNDER CONTROL 
YOU'RE VERY LUCKY YES WHAT DO YOU DO IN THIS WEATHER I PLAY TENNIS 
SWIM AND PLAY BASKETBALL 
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT IT

I'M NOT COMPLAINING THOUGH 
BECAUSE IT'S GUARANTEED THAT BACK HOME IN LONDON IT WILL BE RAINING 
SO I'M MAKING THE MOST OF IT IT'S A WELCOME CHANGE YES 
HOW DO YOU STAY COOL IN THE HOUSE 
THE HOUSE HAS BEEN MADE FROM BLOCKS 
AND THE WINDOWS AND LOUVRES THEY ACTUALLY ALLOW THE FREE FLOW OF AIR 
A FAN IS ALSO USED 
AND THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE IS MADE FROM GALVANISED TIN 
WHICH REFLECTS THE SUN 
THIS MIGHT BE A SILLY QUESTION BUT DO YOU HAVE HEATING NO WE DON'T 
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GET VERY COLD 
THE COLDEST IT WOULD GET IS ABOUT NINETEEN DEGREES CELSIUS 
THAT'S MORE LIKE SUMMER FOR US IN THE U. K. 
HOUSES AREN'T ONLY DESIGNED TO COPE WITH THE HEAT BUT ALSO THE RAINS 
THE RAIN TRICKLES DOWN THE ROOFS 
INTO GUTTERS THAT CHANNEL THE WATER INTO STORAGE TANKS 
MANY HOMES IN GRENADA ARE BUILT ON THE SIDES OF HILLS ON STILTS 
AS THERE'S VERY LITTLE FLAT LAND 
AND THEY ALL HAVE A VERANDA 
WE SPEND QUITE A LOT OF TIME HERE IN THE AFTERNOONS EVENING TIMES

THE LOCATION OF GRENADA'S MOST IMPORTANT INDUSTRY

SPICES BRING IN A LOT OF MONEY TO GRENADA 
WE USE THEM TO ADD FLAVOURS WHEN WE'RE BAKING OR COOKING 
CLOVES CINNAMON GINGER AND NUTMEG ARE ALL GROWN HERE 
AND SOLD TO COUNTRIES ACROSS THE WORLD 
NUTMEG IS GRENADA'S BIGGEST EXPORT 
IF YOU BUY NUTMEG IN THE U. K. THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE IT WAS GROWN HERE

CAN YOU GUESS WHAT THIS RHYME IS ALL ABOUT CECIL 
I THINK THIS RHYME IS ALL ABOUT A STORM IT'S ABOUT A STORM CLOSE 
LET'S HEAR FROM OLABECE HURRICANE SEASON YOU GUESSED RIGHT 
THE FIRST RECORDED HURRICANE THAT STRUCK GRENADA WAS HURRICANE 
JANET JANET YOUR PARENTS DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT THAT GRANDPARENTS 
MY GRANDMOTHER'S BROTHER DIED IN HURRICANE JANET 
THAT WAS SAD 
HURRICANES ARE MASSIVE VIOLENT TROPICAL STORMS 
WITH TORRENTIAL RAIN HIGH WINDS AND VERY HIGH SEAS 
THEY'RE A FEATURE OF TROPICAL WEATHER 
THEY CAN BE DESTRUCTIVE AND DANGEROUS 
LARGE AREAS OF THE CARIBBEAN CAN BE AFFECTED BY HURRICANES 
GRENADA DOESN'T OFTEN GET HIT 
NOW JUST REMEMBER THAT THIS IS A SWEET POTATO THAT YOU ARE PLANTING 
THE CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT AGRICULTURE 
AS IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF LIFE HERE 
THE POTATO IS A ROOT SO IT'S GOING TO GO DOWN INTO THE SOIL 
IT MAY BE CALLED THE SPICE ISLAND 
BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE TO GRENADA THAN JUST SPICES 
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE KNOW THAT THEY LIVE IN A TROPICAL PARADISE 
IT WAS REALLY TOUGH ACTUALLY WORKING IN THE HOT STICKY WEATHER 
BUT I FOUND THE MOST WONDERFUL WAY TO COOL OFF
