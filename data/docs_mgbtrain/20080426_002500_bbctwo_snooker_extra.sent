THE FIRST YEAR I GOT HERE I PLAYED 
BALL HUNTER I MANAGED TO GET DOWN 
BACK TO DUBA NINETY FIVE TO NINE TO 
FIVE LAST YEAR I WAS PIPPED BY 
MARK SELBY L. DID NOT PLAY 
PARTICULARLY WELL AGAINST BARRY 
HAWKINS L. WAS THREE TO ZERO DOWN FOR TO HE 
DID NOT DO MUCH AT ALL IT TURNED 
ROUND A LITTLE BIT DOWN AT THAT 
POINT IN TIME I DID NOT THINK I 
WAS GOING TO WIN WHEN WE GOT 
PULLED OFF IT WAS TO MY ADVANTAGE 
I WAS LUCKY SHAUN MURPHY IS VERY 
CONFIDENT THAT IS HIS GREAT 
STRENGTH HE HAS WON A LOT OF 
MATCHES AND TOURNAMENTS HE IS VERY 
HAPPY IN HIS PERSONAL LIFE I HAVE 
WOULD IMAGINE HE HAS GOT 
EVERYTHING GOING FOR HIM HE IS 
YOUNGER THAN ME THE ATMOSPHERE 
HERE AT THE TWO TABLE SET UP I 
HAVE NOT BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET 
DOWN TO BEAT ONE TABLE SET UP YET 
ALI CARTER LAST IN A FINAL FRAME 
DECIDER LAST YEAR LOST HE IS UP 
AGAINST THE PROVISIONAL WORLD 
NUMBER ONE AND THE CUE FIVE MACRO 
AND THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE CHAMPION SHAUN 
MURPHY 
ALI CARTER IT GETS THIS FIRST FRAME 
IN THE SECOND ROUND MATCH UNDER WAY 
ALI CARTER 
SHAUN MURPHY RETURNS THE CUE BALL 
WITH A PRETTY GOOD SHOT AIDED BY 
THE FLICK ON THE GREEN 
THIS WILL BE THE SECOND TIME THAT 
ALI CARTER HAS PLAYED IN THE SECOND 
ROUND HE IS HE HAS HAD A BEST 
RANKING OF TWENTY FIVE SO FAR HE LOST TO 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN SHAUN MURPHY IS 
LOOKING AT THE LONG RED 
I THINK THIS IS WHERE SHAUN MURPHY 
HAS CHANGED HIS GAME HE HAS HAD A 
CHAT WITH YOU MYSELF AND RAY 
REARDON 
IT IS SAFETY APART FROM REARDON THAT SHOT HE IS USUALLY VERY 
PROFICIENT IN THE SAFETY DEPARTMENT 
IT WAS NICE TO GO AND SEE SHAUN 
WORK ON HIS BREAK BUILDING 
HE IS PROVISIONALLY WORLD NUMBER 
ONE ALI CARTER WAS A LITTLE BIT 
UNLUCKY HE PLAYED THE FULL BALL 
CANNON ON THE RED UNFORTUNATELY 
FOR HIM HE CAUGHT IT HALF BALL IT 
WAS VERY UNLUCKY 
HE IS LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF 
A PLANT 
THAT WAS A CARELESS SHOT FROM SEAN 
WE BUILT HIM A PREVIOUSLY ABOUT HOW 
GOOD HIS TACTICAL GAME WAS SHAUN 
MURPHY GOING FOR THE PLANT HE 
FORGOT ABOUT THE SAFETY SIDE OF THE 
SHOT L. KNOW IT IS THE BEST OF TWENTY FIVE 
BUT YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE LEAVING 
YOUR OPPONENT BARELY ON WITH GOOD 
OPPORTUNITIES EARLY 
ALI CARTER IS A GREAT PLAYER HE 
HAS BEEN GIVEN A TWO GOOD 
OPPORTUNITIES THIS IS A BETTER 
OPPORTUNITY GIVEN TWO GOOD 
OPPORTUNITIES 
HE DID NOT GET THE REQUIRED SCREW 
ON THE CUE BALL HE MUST POWER THIS 
ONE IN 
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO KISS THE 
BROWN IT IS BIT CLOSE TO THE CUSHION 
THE BROWN MAYBE THE BALL CUSHION HE DECIDES TO GET ON THE BLUE LOOKED THINNER FROM OUR 
COMMENTARY POSITION ONCE AGAIN HE 
WAS UNLUCKY THERE IS A LOT OF WORK 
TO DO THE BLUE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
PERFECT 
THAT WAS TRICKY WELL PLAYED THE 
PINK HAS GONE SLIGHTLY OUT OF 
COMMISSION AT THE MOMENT 
I WONDER 
IF THERE IS A SHOT ON TO POT THE 
RED AND CANNON IT THROUGH THE GAP 
HE HAS PLAYED IT WELL HE COULD NOT QUITE GET INTO THE CUE 
BALL A TWO REDS ARE THE KEY TO THE 
FRAME THIS IS EIGHT GOOD EFFORT 
FROM ALI CARTER THE TWO REDS 
HAS BEEN SAID THAT HE SOMETIMES 
LETS FRAME WINNING LEADS DISAPPEAR 
IN MATCHES 
HE KNOWS ALL THE SHOTS HE IS A 
VERY GOOD SCORER HE HAS A GREAT 
CUE ACTION 
NOW HE HAS DEVELOPED THESE INTO A 
CHANCE TO WIN FRAME AT THIS VISIT 
IF HE CANNOT PLAYED THE SCREW SHOT 
FOR THE BLACK HE MIGHT GET ON TOOK 
A ON TO A COLOUR 
JUST TWO OR THREE SHOTS AWAY FROM 
WINNING THE FRAME IT IS KEEP IN 
THE OPENING FRAME OF MATCH TO 
KEEP YOUR OPPONENT IN HIS CHAIR AT 
LEAST TRY TO CLEAR ALL THE REDS TO 
STOP SHAUN MURPHY GETTING TO THE 
TABLE 
HE IS ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS IN 
THE WORLD THE FRAME IS STILL LIVE 
AT THE MOMENT 
THIS IS JUST THE START THAT ALI 
CARTER WAS LOOKING FOR HE IS A 
TERRIFIC PLAYER 
IF YOU LET HIM GET HIS CONFIDENCE 
UP YOU COULD BE IN TROUBLE 
THE FRAME IS SAFE BET HE WANTS TO 
KEEP GOING BUT SHAUN MURPHY 
TRIED A SAFETY SHOT AND DID IT ALL 
WRONG IT WAS THE END OF THE FRAME 
HE HAS TAKEN THEM WELL 
ALI CARTER 
WILL TRY HIS HEART OUT TO MAKE A 
CENTURY AT THE CRUCIBLE 
HE NEEDS SOME SORT OF ANGLE ON THE 
RED IF IT IS STRAIGHT HE WILL 
STRUGGLE HIS HIGHEST BREAK IS ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR 
HE MADE THAT LAST YEAR AT THIS 
CHAMPIONSHIP HE HAS MADE EIGHT 
CRUCIBLE CENTURIES HE HAS HAD TWENTY 
CENTURIES THIS SEASON 
HE HAS BEEN KNOCKING THEM IN THE THE WAY HE HAS PLAYED HE DESERVES A 
CENTURY 
IT IS ALWAYS BEST TO PLAY THESE 
KIND OF SHOTS LIKE THAT THAT IS A 
SHAME 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SHAME CERTAIN CENTURY WHAT A START FOR 
ALI CARTER EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN BREAK GIVES HIM THE 
OPENING FRAME 
HE NEEDS TO PULL UP A LITTLE BIT 
THAT IS PRETTY GOOD THAT SOUNDED LIKE A KICK IF HE IS 
DEAD STRAIGHT IT MEANS THE NEXT 
POT WILL BE SLIGHTLY MORE DIFFICULT 
HE WAS DEAD STRAIGHT ALL HE COULD 
DO WAS RUN THE WHITE THROUGH L. 
THINK HE HAS FOUND THE GAP A FEW 
REDS WILL POT IN THE CORNER HE 
WILL PLAY FOR THE BLUE AGAIN 
HE STAND IN FOR THE BLUE STUNNED HE PLAYED IT WELL HE IS CONCERNED 
AT GETTING BACK IN THE FRAME AT THE 
MOMENT IT WILL BE TOUGH TO GET ON 
TO THE REDS 
THIS IS WHERE THE TROUBLE STARTS 
HE CAN PLAYED THE CANNON PLAY ODDS ARE AGAINST THE POT HE DID NOT HAVE THE WHITE IN THE 
RIGHT PLACE 
IT IS A VERY EASY 
SAFETY SHOT IT MUST BE A PLANT HE 
TOOK A LONG TIME LOOKING AT THAT 
WHERE WILL THE BLACK GO 
HE IS COMING ROUND AGAIN TO HAVE A 
LOOK THE ANGLE HE WOULD HIT IT AT 
HE COULD MAKE IT INTO A PLANT IT 
IS GOING TO THE LEFT OF THE POCKET 
IF HE CATCHES THE RED TOO THICK IT 
COULD MAKE THE PLANT 
THAT WAS FINE THAT HAS TURNED OUT A LOT BETTER THAN I AM SURE HE THOUGHT 
BE THINNED SHOT ON THE RED HE 
EITHER CANNONS INTO THE BOOK OFF 
THE BROWN 
INTO THE BOOK OR THE BROWN HE 
CAN SEE IT BUT CAN HE POT IT 
BLUE 
THAT IS TIGHT HE WILL HAVE BLUE TO OFF THE CUSHION HE WILL 
FLICK THE BROWN IF HE TRIES TO POT 
IT DIRECT B. T. IS SO DIFFICULT TO 
JUDGE THE ANGLE IT HE HAS GOT 
TO HIT IT HALF BALL 
THAT WAS CLOSE IT IS NOT TO EIGHT 
GOOD CUE BALL 
IT IS A BIG TARGET BEHIND THE GREEN 
AND BLACK THE ANGLE HE NEEDS HE 
WILL CANNON INTO THE OTHER REDS HE 
WILL BE RELUCTANT TO PLAYED THE 
SAFETY SHOT PLAY IS WHERE HE WOULD LIKE TO PUT THE CUE BALL 
HE HAS TAKEN A RISK IT WAS PLAYED 
AT EXCELLENT PACE THAT WAS A GOOD 
SHOT 
THAT IS ONE OF THE BEST LOOKS YOU 
WILL EVER HAVE WIS A WISH TO SEE 
HE WAS PLAYING A SAFETY SHOT HE 
HAS KNOCKED THE RED INTO THE MIDDLE 
POCKET THAT IS ONE OF THE ALL TIME 
GREAT LOOKS FLUKES 
OH DEAR THAT WAS A REALLY BAD 
MISTAKE HE PROBABLY FELT 
EMBARRASSED ABOUT THE FLUKE 
HE MISJUDGED THE SCREW SHOT I 
WOULD STILL HAVE A GO AT IT THE RED 
IN THE RIGHT CORNER AT THE RED 
THAT WAS GOOD CAN HE SCREW 
STRAIGHT DOWN OR IS HE GOING TO 
HAVE TO USE THE CUSHION 
IT WAS THE END OF THE WHITE LINE 
THAT HE WANTED TO GET TO 
UP TO AND INCLUDING THE PINK TO BE 
ABSOLUTELY SURE IT IS A BIT OF A 
BODY BLOW FOR SHAUN MURPHY IT 
LOOKED LIKE HE WAS GOING TO SCORE 
FEW MORE HE GOT TOP SIDE OF THE 
PINK 
HE PLAYED A BRILLIANT SAFETY SHOT 
BEFORE ALI CARTER GOT THE FLUKE 
THE BLUE IS NOT ON ITS USUAL SPOT 
HE IS STEADYING HIMSELF THAT IS CARELESS 
IF HE POTS THE BLUE HE WILL ONLY 
BE THIRTEEN IN FRONT HE HAS GOT TO TAKE 
THE BLUE INTO THE MIDDLE POCKET 
WELL PLATE A LONG STRAIGHT PINK 
TO TAKE THE SECOND FRAME 
THAT FRAME WILL HIT SHAUN MURPHY 
MORE THAN THE OPENING FRAME 
I DO NOT KNOW WHY IT IS BUT EVERY 
TIME YOU PLAY A PLANT YOU DO NOT 
SEEM TO GET THE WHITE IN A NICE 
POSITION 
HE IS RAISING THE BUTT OF THE TWO 
AND IT IS SO EASY TO GET A LITTLE 
BIT OF SIDE ON IT 
THAT IS UNLUCKY IF HE SLIPS PAST 
THE BLUE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
PERFECT 
ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT PERFECT KISS AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
KISS AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ON BOTH REDS 
WITH THAT SHOT HE IS JUST ABOUT 
FAVOURITE TO WIN THIS FRAME 
IT IS ALL ABOUT THE RED NEXT TO THE 
YELLOW 
THIS WOULD BE A BODY BLOW FOR SHAUN 
MURPHY WHO HAD THAT BREAK OF FORTY NINE 
IN THE PREVIOUS FRAME HE FLUKED 
TWO REDS AND CLEARED UP 
THIS TIME HE GOT HIMSELF IN WITH A 
GOOD PLANT DOES THE RED NEXT TO 
THE PINK POT 
HE PUT THE WHITE IN A POSITION 
WHERE HE WOULD HAVE A CHOICE OF 
REDS 
WHAT WOULD YOU BE THINKING ON NOT 
LAST RED WE DELIGHT GET ON THE 
BLUE TO MOVE THE RED OR ONE OF THE 
BOL COLOURS WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET 
ON THE BLUE OR ONE OF THE POLL 
COLOURS 
I WOULD LIKE TO GET ON COLOURS COLOURS BLUE THE PLAN OF ATTACK WOULD BE 
BLACK AT THIS RED AND THE DEFEAT 
GET ON THE BLUE HOPEFULLY ON THE BLUE 
IT IS ONE OF THE FEW OCCASIONS 
WHERE PLAYERS LOOK MORE THAN TWO 
SHOTS IN ADVANCE 
WOULD YOU BE TRYING TO GET THE CUE 
BALL ON THE SEMI CIRCLE OF THE KEY 
LINE HE IS LOOKING AT PLAYING THE 
BLACK AT THE SAFETY SHOT BUT I 
THINK I WOULD RATHER GET THE POINTS 
HE IS JUST PLAYING A SAFETY SHOT 
PROBABLY THE ONLY SHOT IN THIS 
FRAME THAT I HAVE NOT AGREED WITH 
BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS THE 
NEGATIVE CHOICE IT SEAN HIT THE 
RED AND GET IT SAFE HE MAY HAVE 
MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO WIN THE 
FRAME AT HIS NEXT VISIT 
I THINK 
THESE WORK SHOT HERE WOULD BE AS 
EASY AS THEN NOTHING BE SWERVING 
SHOT 
FOUL AND A MISS 
IT WAS 
THE RIGHT SHOT BUT HE DID NOT GOOD 
ENOUGH ON IT WITH THESE THIN 
CLOTHS YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM A 
LITTLE BIT MORE 
I THINK THE RED 
WAS JUST PAST THE YELLOW AND THAT 
MAKES A DIFFERENCE ON THE SHOT 
THAT IS WHERE IT WAS IT IS ONLY A 
FRACTION OUT 
ALI CARTER IS JUST 
QUESTIONING WHETHER RED WAS HE IS 
MAKING SURE THAT THE RED IS IN THE 
SAME PLACE HE LIKE MYSELF 
THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE BIT FURTHER 
BACK THAT LOOKS SPOT ON NOW THAT IS NOT BAD 
IF HE WAS NOT BRIDGING OVER THE 
YELLOW HERE HE WOULD HAVE A GO AT 
THIS INTO THE MIDDLE POCKET 
IT LOOKS AS IF HE STILL TOOK IT ON 
AND THIS IS A CHANCE L. THINK IT 
WAS A BIT TOO RISKY TO TAKE THE POT 
THE WAY THAT HE WAS BRIDGING OVER 
THE YELLOW THERE 
YELLOW IS THE EASIEST POT BUT HE 
NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER YELLOW COMES BACK ONTO ITS OWN SPOT 
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SECOND 
FRAME THIS WILL GET SHAUN MURPHY'S 
CONFIDENCE BACK 
THIS IS A TEST OF YOUR CUE ACTION 
NEAR THE CUSHION 
HE CUED BUT BEAUTIFULLY CUED AND 
THAT 
SHAUN MURPHY STARTED WITH A BREAK 
OF FORTY NINE AND ALI CARTER RESPONDED WITH 
A BREAK OF FORTY FOUR BUT THAT THIRTY THREE HAS 
GIVEN SHAUN MURPHY THE FRAME 
IT IS AN EASY SNOOKER IN BEHIND THE 
GREEN BUT IF YOU POT THE BROWN INTO 
THE MIDDLE YOU HAVE THE CHANCE OF 
WINNING THE FRAME 
BUT THE MIDDLE POCKET IS TOUGH 
COMING FROM THAT ANGLE 
VERY GOOD THE CUE BALL JUST 
RUNNING AWAY FROM HIM A LITTLE BIT 
BUT STILL OKAY 
NOT THE TALLEST OF PLAYERS ALI 
CARTER AND COULD NOT QUITE STRETCH 
A RANGE TO REACH THAT STRETCH 
AROUND 
IF HE HAD STOPPED SHORTER HE COULD 
HAVE DEVELOPED THE BLACK 
HE PLAYED IT WELL YOU CANNOT HIT 
THEM ANY BETTER THAN THAT 
IT IS A GREAT SHOT TO HAVE IN YOUR 
ARMOURY WHEN YOU CAN GENERATE 
ENOUGH SPIN 
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF DIFFICULT 
REDS THAT HE WILL HAVE TO BECAUSE 
SHE HAD THE ONE NEXT TO THE BLUE 
WILL COME INTO THE CORNER POCKETS 
HE WARBLED THAT ONE AT BIT HE 
BOUGHT ALL BUT ONE A BIT 
HE CAN BRING THE WHITE BACK JUST A 
LITTLE TOUCH AND THEN HE HAS AN 
ANGLE TO POT THE PINK AND DEVELOP 
THE RED NEAR THE MIDDLE POCKET 
FORTY THE DIFFERENCE SO THE PINK WILL 
ABSOLUTELY MAKE SURE 
THIS IS A GREAT START FOR ALI 
CARTER THE FORMER WORLD CHAMPION 
UP AGAINST THE FORMER WORLD 
CHAMPION SHAUN MURPHY WITH A 
LITTLE BIT TO THINK ABOUT DURING 
THE MID SESSION INTERVAL 
I AM 
SURE HE WAS AWARE THAT HE WOULD BE 
IN FOR A TOUGH MATCH BUT I HAVE 
BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE WAY ALI 
CARTER HAS STARTED THIS MATCH HE 
LOOKED TOTALLY AT EASE OUT THERE THAT COULD BE A VERY USEFUL FLUKE 
ALWAYS REMINDS ME OF BALLS WHEN YOU 
SEE THE BALL COMING OFF THE CUSHION 
LIKE THAT 
AN EXCELLENT SAFETY SHOT THERE MAY 
BE A PLANT ON BUT IT IS NOT A 
NATURAL WEREN'T IF HE DOES TAKE IT 
ON THE CUE BALL WILL BE TRAVELLING 
TO WARD RED AND BLACK 
THERE IS A 
BIT OF DIFFERENCE DISTANCE 
BETWEEN THE TWO BALLS 
HE IS TIGHT ON THE CUSHION AND THE 
WHITE WILL AUTOMATICALLY GO TOWARDS 
BLACK AND REDS 
HE DESERVED TO FINISH ON A COLOUR 
BECAUSE HE DID TAKE A RISK THERE 
AND IT COULD NOT HAVE TURNED OUT 
BETTER 
IF HE PLAYS THE BLUE HE COULD DO 
WITH NOT MAKING CONTACT WITH ANY OF 
THE REDS 
THAT IS A BAD MISS FROM SHAUN 
MURPHY HE CANNOT AFFORD BE MISSING 
THOSE CHANCES 
IT IS THE TYPE OF SHOT BUT TAKES A 
BIT OF YOUR CONFIDENCE THAT 
TAKES YOUR CONFIDENCE 
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SAFE REDS 
BUT ALI CARTER MAY HAVE THE FRAME 
SAFE BEFORE THEN HE WILL BE 
GETTING A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED 
PINK OR BLUE FROM THIS RED AND 
SHAUN MURPHY WILL NEED A SNOOKER 
THE PINK MEANS REGARDLESS OF WHAT 
HAPPENS ADDED CAR TOWED CANNOT 
PLEASE THIS SESSION ALI CARTER 
SHAUN MURPHY SIGNALS TO THE REFEREE 
THAT HE HAS HAD ENOUGH 
PRONE IS AVAILABLE BLUE IS 
AVAILABLE AROUND BROWN IS 
AVAILABLE 
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO FORCE THE 
ISSUE AND CHANGED THE WAY THE GAME 
IS GOING 
HE MAY HAVE BEEN LUCKY AGAIN BUT HE 
MISSED A SITTER OF UP BLACK AND HE 
HAS BEEN LUCKY 
THAT IS A COUPLE OF POTS BUT HE HAS 
TAKEN ON MISS THEM AND IT LOOKED 
AS THOUGH HE WAS GOING TO RELIEVE 
ALI CARTER IN AMONGST THE BALLS 
LEAVE ALI CARTER 
I WAS JUST 
A BAD TO SAY WAS A NICE LITTLE SHOT TO NOTHING CAN HE AVOID THE KISS UPON THE RED 
THIS IS A GOOD EFFORT THERE IS NOT 
MUCH LEFT NOT MUCH ROOM TO GET IN 
BEHIND THE GREEN BUT HE WILL NOT 
SEE A BETTER SAFETY SHOT THAN THAT 
THERE HAVE THAT WAS A DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR ALI CARTER 
HE WILL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING PRETTY 
CARELESS 
THE FACT THAT HIS FOUR TO ONE BEHIND A 
LITTLE BIT OF NERVES COMING IN 
EVENTUALLY HE COULD DO WITH TO 
WHITE SITTING WHERE THE PINK IS THAT IS CLEVER HE NEEDS THE TWO REDS 
SHAUN MURPHY'S SAFETY HAS NOT BEEN 
QUITE UP TO SCRATCH TODAY 
THE YELLOW IS THE EASIER POT TO GET 
TO THE RED PINK OR BLACK OFF THIS LAST RED 
SHAUN MURPHY HAS HELD HIMSELF 
TOGETHER IT IS A VERY GOOD BREAK 
THE BREAK OF FIFTY THREE COMES TO AN END 
SHAUN MURPHY SHOULD CLOSE THE GAP 
TO TWO 
ALI CARTER DECIDED THAT WAS ENOUGH 
SEAN RAP SHAUN MURPHY HAS STOPPED 
THE ROT HE JUST OVERDID THAT A LITTLE BIT 
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT HE GETS A 
GOOD 
ANGLE ON 
THE COLOUR 
TO GO INTO 
THE REDS IT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE THE GREEN 
THAT IS THE ANGLE HE WILL BE 
LOOKING FOR TO GET INTO THE REDS 
HE IS UNLUCKY HE IS VERY UNLUCKY 
IT IS AMAZING THAT SHOT WORKS NINETY NINE 
TIMES OUT OF ONE HUNDRED WE HAVE SEEN 
SHAUN MURPHY DO THAT AND STICK ON 
THEM AND WE HAVE SEEN 
ALI CARTER 
DIDA AND 
STICK ON THEM HOW 
STRANGE DO THAT 
THAT WAS A TRICKY PLANT BUT IT WAS 
A SHOT TO NOTHING IF THE PLANT 
GOES IN HE ROLLS UP BEHIND THE 
BROWN AND GREEN 
THE OTHER SESSION HAS FINISHED A 
BIT EARLIER THAN 
THIS ONE THEY 
HAVE GOT THE ARENA TO THEMSELVES 
THE SPECTATORS HAVE STAYED IN THEIR 
SEATS 
ON THE 
OTHER SIDE THERE ARE 
SEATS ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE ARE A FEW 
EMPTY ONES 
THE CAMERAS HAVE 
GOT MORE ROOM TO MOVE AROUND YOU 
CAN SEE WHERE THE SCREEN WAS IT IS 
THE GREATEST VENUE IN THE WORLD 
WHEN 
IT GETS 
TO ONE TABLE IT 
IT CHANGES COMPLETELY YOU HAVE GOT 
NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY PEOPLE THE ONES IN THE BACK 
ROW 
HAVE A 
PERFECT VIEW IT IS 
SPECIAL 
HE PLAYED IT JUST UP AND DOWN HE 
REALISED IT WAS TOO DIFFICULT TO 
GET BACK INTO THE PORK BULK 
IF ALI CARTER CAN GET THIS FRAME 
HE IS GUARANTEED AN OVERNIGHT LEAD 
IT WOULD BE FIVE TO THREE OR POSSIBLY EVEN 
SIX TO TWO HE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR 
ANY RESULT HE WOULD SETTLE FOR FIVE TO THREE 
SHAUN MURPHY WOULD LOVE TO GET BACK 
TO FOUR TO FOUR 
THE FACT THE CUE BALL HAS BOUNCED 
OFF THE CUSHION MAKES IT AN EASIER 
TARGET TO GET BEHIND THE GREEN AND 
BROWN 
THAT WAS TOO THIN IT IS A POOR 
SAFETY SHOT HE NEED SOME HELP FROM 
THE BLUE NEEDS AS YOU CAN SEE 
HE HAS GOT A BIT 
OF HELP 
FROM 
BLUE THERE ARE 
ANOTHER TWO REDS 
THAT CAN POT 
HE PLAYS THAT SHOT SO WELL SHAUN 
MURPHY HE CAN PUT ALI CARTER IN 
ALL SORTS OF TROUBLE HE IS VERY 
GOOD AT THIS TOUCH 
SHAUN MURPHY IS THINKING THAT THE 
CUE BALL ROLLED OFF HAS HE LEFT 
THIS RED OUT HIS HAND GESTURE 
SUGGESTED THE CUE BALL ROLLED OFF A 
BIT HE DID THE EASY BIT HE CAN 
GET THROUGH 
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT SHAUN MURPHY 
POTTED A RED 
AND TRIED 
TO GET 
BEHIND THE BROWN 
AND DID 
NOT DO HE 
HAS LOST THE ADVANTAGE THE BLACK 
LOOKS TOO THIN THE PINK LOOKS 
TRICKY IN THE MIDDLE HE WENT FOR THE SAFETY 
ALI CARTER WILL NEVER GET A 
CHANCE THAN THIS TO WIN ANOTHER 
FRAME JUST THREE REDS THREE 
COLOURS NO PROBLEM 
ALI CARTER APPEARS TO BE CERTAIN TO 
TAKE AT LEAST TWO FRAME WINNING LEAD INTO TOMORROW'S SESSIONS 
THAT WAS THE FRAME BALL HE HAS 
THIS GROUP THAT BUT HE IS SIXTY ONE AHEAD 
HE CAN ROLL THIS ONE INTO THE 
MIDDLE POCKET 
A LOT TO THINK ABOUT FOR THE FORMER 
WORLD CHAMPION HE HAS LOOKED VERY 
GOOD IN 
THIS 
OPENING SESSION ALI CARTER HIS 
HIGHEST BREAK WAS IN THE OPENING 
FRAME OF NINETY SEVEN 
HE HAS BEEN CONSISTENT THE MOST 
IMPORTANT THING IS THE SCORE LINE 
HE TRIED A VERY DIFFICULT GREEN 
THAT WAS A VERY COMFORTABLE FRAME 
FOR ALI CARTER BREAKS OF 
THEN HE HAS FINISHED WITH A BREAK 
OF FORTY ONE 
HE EXTENDS HIS LEAD 
AND IS 
NOW FIVE TO TWO IN FRONT 
SHAUN MURPHY BREAKING 
OFF IN 
THE LAST FRAME OF 
THIS AFTERNOON SESSION WITH IT 
BEING THE BEST OF TWENTY FIVE IF IT WERE 
THE 
BEST OF 
NINETEEN AND HE 
WAS SIX TWO 
BEHIND 
HE WOULD BE 
TO 
WIN YOU HAVE GOT 
TO PLAY THIS 
AS IF 
IT IS 
THE LAST FRAME OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
FIVE TO THREE IS EASIER TO COME BACK FROM 
DONE SIXTY TWO THAN SIX TO TWO 
THAT WAS A VERY GOOD SHOT FROM 
SHAUN 
MURPHY THERE IS NO 
BACK DOWN THE TABLE FROM THIS 
POSITION 
HE PLAYED THE DELICATE SHOT I AM 
JUST WONDERING IF THE RED 
POTS CAN 
SHAUN 
MURPHY SEE 
ENOUGH OF IT 
THE 
ONE NEXT TO THE BLACK 
I THINK IT IS TOO TIGHT ISN'T IT 
THERE IS NO 
WAY HE 
CAN GET TO THE 
POTTING ANGLE WITH THE 
POTTING ANGLE WITH THE BLACK BEING TIED UP RATHER 
THAN MOVE THE 
RED 
AWAY RICHES 
IN OPEN 
PLAY I 
WOULD 
TRY TO 
GET BEHIND THE GREEN 
WHICH 
IT HIS BEST FOR HIM T. FORCE ALI 
CARTER TO MAKE A 
SAFETY SHOT 
L. 
THINK HE MAY HAVE LEFT IT TO 
FORCE ALI CARTER OF IT DID GO CLOSE TO 
THE PACK 
BUT IT 
WAS THEN ENOUGH 
TO KEEP THE WHITE 
IN PLAY THING THIN 
ALI CARTER IS LOOKING AT THE RED 
NEXT 
TO THE 
BLACK WE 
KNOW IT 
IS 
NOT AVAILABLE 
THE PINK IS 
AVAILABLE INTO COUPLE OF POCKETS I THINK THE ONLY PROBLEM IF HE 
PLAYS FOR THE 
PINK IT MAY BE TIED 
UP THE BLACK SPOT IS CERTAINLY 
TIED UP 
YOU CAN SEE THERE IS A BRAVE 
VIRTUALLY ON THAT LIVE CROSS RED 
COULD CHAMPIONSHIP TABLES ALWAYS 
HAVE LITTLE CHALK MARK GOOD 
HE TRIED TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN HE WAS TRYING TO CLEAR THE PINK 
SPOT IF IT GOES ON ITS OWN SPOT 
HE WILL HAVE DONE 
HIS JOB THAT 
IS 
WHAT YOU 
HAVE TO DO 
THE BLACK 
IS 
OUT OF 
PLAY HE 
CAN STILL WIN 
THE FRAME 
WITH THE 
PINK'S BLACK 
IS OUT HE IS ON IT NICELY 
A VERY COMPACT PLAYER ALI CARTER 
WITH NICE STANCE AND NICE TIRE 
OF IT IS BIT LIKE WHEN YOU WATCH 
IAN WOOSNAM PLAYED GOLF HE IS 
SMALL AND NOT MUCH CAN GO WRONG 
WITH DEEP SWING ALI CARTER IS LIKE 
THAT VERY COMPACT 
HE IS A VERY DANGEROUS PLAYER HE 
SCORES HEAVILY HE SEEMS TO GO IN 
SPELLS WHERE HE PLAYS GREAT AND 
THEN HE WILL DISAPPEAR FOR A COUPLE 
OF TOURNAMENTS HE SUFFERED WITH A 
LOT OF ILL HEALTH AND THAT DID NOT 
DO HIM ANY FAVOURS IT IS NICE TO 
SEE HIM BACK FIGHTING FIT NOW 
IN TWO THOUSAND THREE HE HAD CROHN'S DISEASE AND 
HAD TO HAVE HOSPITAL TREATMENT 
THERE WERE A FEW COMPLICATIONS BUT 
HE IS BACK TO NORMAL 
WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING WELL WHEN HIS 
CLUB TO REDS LIKE THAT YOU ALWAYS 
SEEM TO GET THE NICE RUN WHEN YOU 
ARE STRUGGLING SOMETHING SEEMS TO 
GET IN THE WAY 
IF SOMEONE HAD TOLD ALI CARTER HE 
WOULD BE LEADING SIX TO TWO AFTER THE 
FIRST SESSION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
MORE THAN DELIGHTED SHAUN MURPHY 
MUST BE IN A LITTLE BIT OF SHOCK 
ALI CARTER IS QUITE CAPABLE OF 
DOING THIS HE DEFEATED STEPHEN 
HENDRY LAST YEAR AT THIS STAGE 
HE STARTED THE MATCH WITH A BREAK 
OF NINETY SEVEN AND HE MAY FINISH THIS 
SESSION WITH ONE A LITTLE HIGHER 
THAN THAT PERFECT 
I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT HE HAS HAD 
TWENTY CENTURY BREAKS AT THE CRUCIBLE 
THEATRE IN FACT IT IS EIGHT 
CENTURIES AT THE CRUCIBLE TWENTY 
CENTURIES THIS SEASON 
HE HAS TO THINK THAT IF HE CAN SHED 
THE TWO SESSIONS LEFT TO PLAY HE 
WILL BE THROUGH TO THE QUARTER 
FINAL VERY WELL PLAYED 
NOT A TOTAL CLEARANCE THERE BUT 
ALI CARTER PLAYED THE BEST SNOOKER 
THIS AFTERNOON AND SHAUN MURPHY HAS 
IT TO DO NAIRN 
WE WILL BE BACK LATER ON TODAY AT 
ONE P. M. YOU CAN COPE TO THE 
INTERACTIVE OPTION FIRE THE RED 
BUTTON AT TEN A M. THAT HAS THE SECOND 
SESSION OF THE MATCH WE HAD JUST 
BEEN WATCHING PAST THE CONCLUSION
