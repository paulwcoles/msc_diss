OF COURSE I MEAN THE SPOON AND NOT THE ICE CREAM 
SPOONS START OFF LOOKING LIKE THIS 
RAW METAL 
THIS IS RAW SILVER 
THE METAL IS MELTED HERE IN THE MELTING SHOP 
IT TURNS INTO LIQUID WHEN IT IS VERY HOT 
THE HOT METAL GOES DOWN THIS FUNNEL 
THEN INTO THIS MOULD CALLED A DIE 
IT HARDENS VERY QUICKLY AND TURNS INTO THIS SOLID METAL BAR 
THE METAL BAR IS STILL VERY HOT TOO HOT TO TOUCH 
IT'S COOLED DOWN BY LOTS OF COLD WATER 
THE METAL BAR IS FLATTENED AND THEN FED INTO THIS MACHINE 
THE MACHINE IS CUTTING THE METAL INTO STRIPS 
THERE ARE THE METAL STRIPS COMING OUT THE OTHER END 
THEN THE STRIPS ARE FLATTENED AT ONE END 
THE FLAT BIT'S GOING TO BE THE EATING END OF THE SPOON 
THIS MACHINE IS CUTTING OUT SPOON SHAPES FROM THE METAL 
CAN YOU SEE THE CUT OUT SPOON SHAPE IN THE MIDDLE 
AND THERE ARE THE CUT OUT SPOONS 
THESE SPOONS ARE GOING TO HAVE A PATTERN ON THE HANDLE 
IT'S STAMPED ON BY THIS HEAVY STAMPING MACHINE 
NOW FOR THE EATING END OF THE SPOON 
IT'S BEING MADE INTO A BOWL SHAPE SO YOU CAN SCOOP FOOD UP INTO IT 
ALL THE ROUGH EDGES ARE BEING SMOOTHED 
SO THAT THE HANDLE IS EASY TO HOLD 
AND NOW THEY JUST NEED A GOOD POLISH 
THEY'RE ALL SO SHINY 
THIS FINISHED SPOON IS SO SHINY YOU CAN SEE YOUR FACE IN IT 
MAYBE THEY'LL END UP ON YOUR DINNER TABLE 
DIDN'T THOSE SPOONS LOOK SHINY 
NOW YOU USE SPOONS TO EAT ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT FOOD
