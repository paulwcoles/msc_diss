WE'VE A BIT OF GARLIC IN THERE AND THAT'S GOING TO GO INTO AN OVENPROOF DISH LOVELY 
THEN IT WILL GO IN THE OVEN AND GET NICE AND CARAMELISED ON TOP 
REALLY REALLY GOOD WOW IS THAT FAMILIAR TO YOU JOHN 
YEAH WITH THE GARLIC THE CREAM AND THE STILTON GOING THROUGH IT 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I COULD DO MYSELF 
WHEN YOU GO IN TO A RESTAURANT THAT'S WHAT YOU ENJOY ISN'T IT 
THE SAUCES AND WHAT HAVE YOU ABSOLUTELY 
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU GROWING UP JOHN WERE YOU EXPOSED WAS THAT A TOUGH TIME 
YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER ON YOUR MUM HAD TO TAKE THAT TIN OF SALMON AND EXTEND IT 
WAS IT GENERALLY LIKE THAT DID YOU HAVE LOTS OF BROTHERS AND SISTERS 
YES WELL THERE WAS SEVEN OF US IN THE FAMILY 
MY FATHER WAS A CRANE DRIVER ON SALFORD DOCKS 
SO IT WAS AMAZING HOW THEY COULD MAKE ALL THAT FOOD GO AROUND 
I THINK HE USED TO EARN ABOUT NINE TEN SHILLINGS A WEEK WAS THE BASIC WAGE 
AND YET HE USED TO FEED SIX SEVEN PEOPLE IT'S UNBELIEVABLE 
THAT'S WHY AS I SAY WITH THE SALMON 
MY MOTHER USED TO CHOP IT UP AND MIX IT UP WITH BREAD AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
AND WITH VINEGAR THAT'S HOW I THOUGHT SALMON TASTED YOU KNOW 
THAT'S AMAZING SO WHAT ABOUT TWELVE MINUTES TO GO GUYS 
WHAT ABOUT THE SNOOKER BIZ WHO INSPIRED YOU THEN WHO GOT YOU INVOLVED IN THAT 
WELL MY FATHER USED TO PLAY IT FUNNY ENOUGH FROM THE FIRST DAY I REMEMBER 
WE USED TO GET THE CLOTHES OFF THE WASHING LINE WITH AN OLD BROKEN SNOOKER CUE 
WHEN I WAS ABOUT ELEVEN HE BOUGHT ME A SNOOKER TABLE 
A LITTLE ONE JUST TO FIT ON THE DINING TABLE 
WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN I WON THE BOYS' SNOOKER CHAMPIONSHIP OF GREAT BRITAIN 
SO WHEN YOU WIN SOMETHING AS A KID YOU WANNA DO THAT OF COURSE 
DID YOU KNOW THAT WILLIE THORNE WAS INVITED TO PLAY ON POT BLACK 
BECAUSE HE WAS THE BEST LOOKING SNOOKER PLAYER AROUND OH REALLY 
WELL YOU CAN TELL SURELY NOTHING'S CHANGED THEN EH WILL 
DID YOU HAVE YOUR BARNET IN THOSE DAYS 
I HAD MY HAIR TILL I WAS TWENTY TWO 
THEN IT JUST DISAPPEARED PICTURE HIM WITH HAIR 
MARK SPITZ REMEMBER MARK SPITZ 
THE SWIMMER I DO YEAH THAT'S WHO HE LOOKED LIKE 
HE WON ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN GOLD OLYMPIC MEDALS DIDN'T HE 
IN THE SWIMMING YEAH AMAZING 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK TURNED SNOOKER AROUND 
WHEN YOU STARTED PLAYING IT WASN'T A TELEVISED SPORT 
WHAT SUDDENLY BROUGHT IT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE PUBLIC 
WELL I THINK IT WAS A COUPLE OF THINGS OBVIOUSLY WHEN COLOUR TELEVISION CAME IN 
I ALSO THINK YOU NEEDED SOMEONE TO MAKE IT EXCITING 
I THINK ALEX HIGGINS DID THAT 
I ALWAYS THINK HE WAS A VERY IMPORTANT INGREDIENT OF THAT 
D'YOU REMEMBER ALEX HIGGINS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF COURSE 
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THINGS ABOUT ALEX BUT I'M ONLY TALKING ABOUT HIM AS A SNOOKER PLAYER 
TO ME HE WAS A GENIUS HALFWAY GENTLEMEN 
HE WAS AN INGREDIENT WE NEEDED 
YOU KNOW LIKE I THINK EVERY SPORT NEEDS A GENIUS 
IS THERE A GENIUS NOW IS RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IN THAT CATEGORY HE'S DEFINITELY IN THAT CATEGORY 
YOU'D HAVE TO SAY THAT RONNIE IS THE MOST NATURAL PLAYER THAT'S EVER PLAYED THE GAME 
LOVELY TALKING TO YOU LET'S GET BACK TO THE FOOD 
DOESN'T IT SMELL FANTASTIC LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SO MUCH IS GOING ON HERE 
LET'S FIND OUT FROM OUR CHEF EXACTLY WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING

HERE'S OUR SALMON SMOKING AWAY NICELY 
I DON'T WANT TO OVERPOWER THIS IT'S JUST GENTLY GOT A LOVELY COLOUR TO IT CAN YOU SMELL IT 
LOOK UNDER THERE JOHN YOU SEE ALL THE SMOKINESS THAT'S COOKING THAT 
OH THAT'S RIGHT YOU GET THEM IN THE CHINESE RESTAURANT THAT'S RIGHT IT'S THAT LITTLE BAMBOO STEAMER 
WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE HERE CHEF YOU'VE POACHED THIS OFF IN WHAT 
IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN YOU POACH FISH I MUST REITERATE 
ALL THE TIME I'M TELLING PEOPLE THIS DON'T OVERCOOK IT 
YOU BRING YOUR BOUILLON TO THE BOIL WHICH IS IN THIS CASE A LITTLE BIT OF GARLIC 
A LITTLE BIT OF DILL FISH STOCK SOME WHITE WINE AND SOME CLOVES 
TO THE BOIL POP YOUR FISH INTO IT TAKE IT OFF THE HEAT 
O. K. AND THEN IT DEPENDS ON THE THICKNESS THOUGH ABSOLUTELY 
FOR THAT KIND OF THICKNESS WHICH YOU SAW THERE THAT ONLY NEEDS FIVE MINUTES IN ITS OWN LIQUOR 
IT JUST FLAKES OFF THE BONE IT WILL BE FANTASTIC 
LET'S GIVE EVERYBODY A LOOK AT THAT SO YOU KNOW AT HOME 
LOOK AT THAT THAT'S WHAT THE CHEF IS REFERRING TO THERE 
FOR THAT TYPE OF THICKNESS STRAIGHT INTO THAT STOCK 
AND THE RESIDUAL HEAT WILL COOK THAT 
DON'T WORRY IF IT'S A LITTLE BIT PINK THINK OF SOMETHING LIKE SUSHI 
THIS IS MY HOT PAN NOW IT'S GOT ENOUGH FLAVOUR I'M GOING TO FINISH IT IN THIS PAN 
HOT OIL SKIN SIDE DOWN I WANT IT CRISPY AND DIGESTIBLE 
THAT GOES IN THERE AND I'M GOING TO FINISH OFF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE SPINACH 
I'LL CUT THAT DOWN VERY GENTLY A LITTLE BIT OF NUTMEG IN THERE 
THAT'S GOING TO GO ALONGSIDE THE SALMON 
THE OTHER HALF I'M GOING TO PUT IN WITH MY COOKED POTATOES HERE

VERY VERY IMPORTANT ACTUALLY 
ALTHOUGH I USED FIRE TO OPEN THOSE ONES I WANTED THE HEAT TO OPEN IT 
WITH MOULES MARINIERE YOU WANT TO DO IT A LITTLE BIT CALMER 
IF IT'S TOO HOT IT SCALDS THE MUSSELS AND THEY ACTUALLY SHUT TOO TIGHT 
SO NICE WHITE WINE REDUCE THAT DOWN THEN PUT SOME CREAM IN THERE

AND A PIECE OF FRESH GINGER 
SHE WON AN AWARD WITH THOSE INGREDIENTS BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO COME UP WITH GARY 
WELL I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THE CHALLENGE AND TRY AND MAKE A SOUP 
SO LET'S USE THE WATERCRESS GINGER AND RHUBARB SEE WHAT HAPPENS THERE YOU NEVER KNOW 
THESE POTATOES ARE COOKED SO WE'LL DO A ROASTED POTATO BLUE CHEESE AND WALNUT SALAD USING THE WATERCRESS 
AND THEN MAYBE LIKE A BIT OF CRYSTALLISED GINGER TO GO WITH THE WATERCRESS 
WE'LL SEE O. K. A FEW THINGS WILL JUST KIND OF RESURFACE THEMSELVES AS YOU START TO COOK EXACTLY 
THAT'S WHY WE PUT OUR CHEFS UNDER PRESSURE HERE THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANY OF THESE INGREDIENTS 
AUDIENCE IF YOU LIKE THAT PRESS THE RED BUTTON OVER TO RICHARD 
WATERCRESS POTATO AND A SMALL AMOUNT OF GINGER 
SERVE IT WITH A POACHED EGG AND FINISH IT OFF WITH A GASTRIC 
BALSAMIC AND RED WINE VINEGAR REDUCED DOWN 
PUT IT OVER THE TOP AND THAT WILL GIVE IT SOME VIBRANT FLAVOURS 
I'M GONNA USE HALF OF THE WATERCRESS FOR THAT 
THE OTHER HALF I'M GONNA DO A POTATO SALAD 
BUT WE'LL MAKE LIKE A MOUSSE BLEND THIS DOWN WITH THE SKIN ON 
SOME WALNUTS IN THERE A LITTLE BIT OF GARLIC A LITTLE BIT OF HONEY 
BLEND THAT UP AND THAT WILL SIT NICELY WITH THESE POTATOES 
THEN I'M GONNA DO A WALNUT AND A WALNUT CRUMBLE SO WE'LL MAKE 
THE WALNUTS ROASTED DOWN WITH THE FLOUR AND BUTTER TO MAKE A CRUMBLE 
SPRINKLE IT OVER THE TOP WITH POACHED RHUBARB A TOUCH OF WHITE WINE AND GINGER 
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK HARD IF HE WINS AREN'T WE

SORRY O. K. RICHARD'S TEN MINUTES' 
SO RIGHT GARY IF I GET YOU TO MAKE A SALAD FOR ME SO TAKE HALF OF THOSE POTATOES 
A BIT OF WATERCRESS BUT RESERVE ME QUITE A LOT FOR THE SOUP 
YEAH BLEND IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF HONEY A TOUCH OF GARLIC 
INTO THE FOOD PROCESSOR AND A TOUCH OF DOUBLE CREAM 
THAT WILL MAKE A NICE PARFAIT 
AINS YOU CAN DO ME A CRUMBLE MIX PLEASE NO PROBLEM 
A FEW WALNUTS A REGULAR CRUMBLE MIX BLENDED WITH THE WALNUTS 
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO PUT THIS IN THE OVEN 
ONE OF THOSE WAYS YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE SEEN A CRUMBLE DONE BEFORE

THEN WE'LL JUST SPRINKLE IT ON THE LOVELY POACHED RHUBARB BROWN OR WHITE SUGAR CHEF 
LET'S GO BROWN PLEASE AINS O. K. THANK YOU 
ONE OF MY PET HATES OF CRUMBLE IS PEOPLE ALWAYS HAVE A SOGGY CRUMBLE DON'T THEY 
MY GENERAL RULE OF THUMB IS TWO PARTS OF THE FRUIT TO ONE PART CRUMBLE 
THAT WAY IT'S NICE AND CRUMBLY NICE AND RICH AND CRISP 
O. K. SO YOU MAKE YOUR CRUMBLE SEPARATE THEN SPRINKLE THAT ON THE TOP I DO YES IT WORKS FOR ME 
THAT'S O. K. I LIKE THE IDEA OF THAT ACTUALLY 
YOU CAN PUT ANYTHING IN THERE YOU LIKE REALLY YEAH O. K. SO LET'S 
LET'S GET THE RHUBARB ON THE GO 
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A PERFECT TIME OF YEAR FOR RHUBARB 
FORCED RHUBARB GENERALLY FROM THE YORKSHIRE TRIANGLE 
WE WANT TO JUST CUT THESE INTO LITTLE BATONS REALLY 
BUT COOK THEM QUITE QUICKLY AND THAT KEEPS THE COLOUR 
WHAT HAPPENS IS A LOT OF RHUBARB IT GOES ALL GREEN AND HORRIBLE 
VERY IMPORTANT WE KNOW WHAT NOT TO DO WITH THAT EAT IT 
STRAIGHT INTO THE BIN VERY IMPORTANT THAT O. K. LOVELY 
YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT WATERCRESS ON THE PROGRAMME TODAY 
AND SHE'S WON ALL THESE AWARDS FOR WATERCRESS BUT BEFORE THAT JENIFER WHEN IS WATERCRESS SEASON 
HOW LONG DOES IT LAST FOR IT'S TRADITIONALLY A WINTER SALAD CROP 
SO IT'S REALLY IN SEASON FROM SOMETHING LIKE SEPTEMBER THROUGH TO MAY TIME 
SO IT'S ONLY THOSE KEY SUMMER MONTHS WE DON'T HAVE IT WE DO NOW BUT IT WAS ALWAYS A WINTER SALAD CROP 
THAT'S WHEN YOU GET THE REAL FLAVOUR THAT PEPPERY FLAVOUR 
IT'S LIKE STRAWBERRIES OOH ALL ABOUT SEASONAL STUFF 
O. K. THEN GUYS 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL IT'S LOVELY AND VIBRANT AND GREEN 
HOW OFTEN DO YOU INCLUDE IT IN YOUR RECIPES QUITE A LOT 
IT'S GOOD FOR WHAT WE'RE DOING I'M GOING TO INCORPORATE A LITTLE OF THE GINGER INTO AS WELL 
AND I THINK THAT WILL WORK WELL ACTUALLY I'VE NOT DONE IT BEFORE 
I LIKE WATERCRESS IT'S NICE IT'S A BIT OUT OF FASHION REALLY DON'T YOU THINK IN A SALAD YEAH 
PEOPLE TEND TO SORT OF GO FOR MICRO CRESSES AND THE FANCY FRISSEE LETTUCES AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
SURE WHAT ABOUT YOU GARY DO YOU USE WATERCRESS I LOVE WATERCRESS 
ABSOLUTELY ACTUALLY A FRIEND OF MINE HE WAS A WATERCRESS PICKER 
AND HE USED TO TELL ME IT'S ACTUALLY A FANTASTIC INDUSTRY TO BE IN 
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND YOU WORK IN THE MORNINGS 
YOU'RE PICKING THE WATERCRESS ALL DAY A BIT WET AND BENT OVER ALL DAY 
THEN HE USED TO PLAY GOLF ALL AFTERNOON SO IT'S A GOOD INDUSTRY TO BE IN AND A FANTASTIC PRODUCT 
SO VERSATILE IT'S A BACK BREAKING INDUSTRY TO BE IN 
WHAT'S IMPORTANT THOUGH WHEN YOU ARE COOKING WATERCRESS IS IT GOES IN RIGHT AT THE END O. K. 
WHAT WE WANT TO DO WE WANT TO KEEP THAT LOVELY VIBRANT GREEN COLOUR 
IF IT WENT IN NOW IT'LL GO BROWN AND HORRIBLE ON US 
WE DON'T WANT THAT HOWEVER THE STALKS TAKE A BIT LONGER TO COOK 
THE STALKS GO IN NOW BUT RESERVE BACK THE LEAVES THEY'RE GOING TO GO IN AT THE LAST MINUTE

HELLO HOW ARE YOU DOING O. K. THANK YOU ENJOYING IT YEAH IT'S LOVELY 
PICKING UP ONE OR TWO TIPS YES BUT YOU'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR A TIP THEN KIM GO ON ASK OUR CHEFS 
WHAT'S THE TOP TIP YOU CAN GIVE ME FOR BINDING MEATBALLS BEFORE YOU FRY THEM OOH 
WHEN YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER TO MAKE A MEATBALL MASSAGE THEM IN YOUR HAND 
WHEN YOU PUT IT TOGETHER THEY FORM TWO HALVES 
SO JUST BIND THE MIX ITSELF WITH A LITTLE BIT OF EGG O. K. 
JUST MAKE SURE YOU MASSAGE THE MEAT AND IT WILL STAY TOGETHER I PROMISE 
AND DO YOU NEED A SLIGHTLY FATTIER MEAT WOULD YOU SAY GARY 
A LOT OF THE MINCE WE GET NOW IS SO LEAN BECAUSE WE'RE ALL SO HEALTH CONSCIOUS 
IT IS I MEAN FIVE PER CENT FAT IS FINE 
FIVE OR TEN PER CENT NO MORE THAN THAT THAT WILL HELP JUST FINE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE USING PORK FANTASTIC 
RICHARD WHAT ABOUT YOU AND YOUR MEATBALLS 
YEAH FAT IS GOOD FAT IS FLAVOUR IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO USE IT 
WHAT I WOULD DO AS A LITTLE TIP IS I WOULD 
I'D MAKE THEM LIKE GARY SAID BUT I'D SET THEM UP IN THE FRIDGE 
SO PUT THEM IN YOUR HANDS GET THEM NICE AND TIGHT LIKE YOU WOULD A BURGER INTO THE FRIDGE 
LET THEM SET FOR ABOUT AN HOUR MINIMUM IDEALLY TWO HOURS THEN WHEN THEY COME OUT COOK THEM 
WHEN THEY GO INTO THE PAN THEY'LL HOLD TOGETHER A LOT BETTER 
FANTASTIC OFTEN WHEN WE MAKE MEATBALLS WE WANT THEM STRAIGHTAWAY DON'T WE 
YEAH I DO IT THE OLD FASHIONED WAY MOMMA SCUDAMORE USED TO GET A BIT OF BREADCRUMB AND POUR SOME WHITE WINE 
IT'S NOT FOR KIDS OR YOU COULD USE APPLE JUICE IF IT'S FOR THE KIDS 
MOISTEN THE BREADCRUMBS LET IT SOAK UP ALL THAT LOVELY FLAVOUR 
A BIT OF OREGANO CRACK AN EGG INTO THAT AND THEN MIX IT IN 
AND THEN MASSAGE THE MEAT INTO IT SALT AND PEPPER THEN FRY THEM OFF 
THAT WILL BIND THEM UP LOVELY AND EXTEND IT A BIT LIKE JOHN VIRGO
