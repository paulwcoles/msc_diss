MOVING HOME IS STRESSFUL SO IMAGINE TRYING TO FIND A DREAM HOME IN THE COUNTRY 
FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY WITH SHOPS AND SCHOOLS NEARBY WITHIN STRIKING 
DISTANCE OF LONDON ALL WHILE TRYING TO SET UP A NEW BUSINESS 
WELCOME TO THE M. TWENTY FIVE 
ALSO KNOWN AS THE LONDON ORBITAL OR LONDON'S BIGGEST CAR PARK DEPENDING ON YOUR POINT OF VIEW 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN MILES OF MOTORWAY HELPING OR HINDERING OVER HALF A MILLION COMMUTERS THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS OF THE YEAR 
IT'S HERE IN THE ESSEX BOROUGH OF THURROCK 
THAT THE MOTORWAY OFFICIALLY ENDS 
IT IS LITTLE WONDER THAT IT IS NOW KNOWN AS THE GATEWAY TO LONDON 
AND IS PRIME COMMUTER TERRITORY FOR THE CITY 
BUT THERE ARE ENTIRE WORKFORCES HERE IN THURROCK ITSELF 
THE INDUSTRIAL ESTATE SURROUNDING THE THAMES GATEWAY EMPLOYS 
HALF A MILLION PEOPLE IN INDUSTRIES FROM PAPER MAKING TO OIL REFINERIES 
AND FOR THOSE LIVING HERE SUBURBAN THURROCK REVOLVES AROUND A SERIES OF ROUNDABOUTS AND SHOPPING CENTRES 
AS HOUSING ESTATES GO THEY DON'T GET MUCH BIGGER THAN CHAFFORD HUNDRED IN THURROCK 
THIS IN NEIGHBOURHOOD HAS TAKEN OVER TWENTY YEARS TO BUILD AND IT IS STILL NOT COMPLETE 
FIVE THOUSAND HOMES HAVE BEEN SQUEEZED ON TO THIS FORMER CHALK QUARRY 
ALONG WITH THE THREE SCHOOLS THREE SUPERMARKETS AND A TRAIN STATION 
EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR REAL LIFE EVEN IF IT LOOKS MORE LIKE TOY TOWN 
EVERYTHING IS GEARED TOWARDS YOUNG FAMILIES AND FIRST TIME BUYERS KEEN TO GET ONTO THE PROPERTY LADDER 
BUT FOR LI AND STEVE BROOKMAN CHAFFORD HUNDRED PLUS TWO KIDS IS NOT ADDING UP 
RUNNING A FAMILY IS NEVER EASY 
CLEANING WASHING IRONING BUT IN THE BROOKMAN HOUSE EVERYDAY TASKS CAN BE AN EVEN BIGGER UNDERTAKING 
BECAUSE OF THE LAYOUT WE'RE A LONG WAY FROM OUR GARDEN 
WE'RE ON TOP OF FOUR GARAGES SO TO GET TO IT YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AROUND THE SIDE 
IT'S A PROBLEM FOR JUST A SIMPLE TASK LIKE TAKING THE WASHING OUT 
AND WITH ONE CHILD SOMETIMES TWO IF EADIE'S NOT AT SCHOOL IT'S JUST A REAL PALAVER TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE 
COME ON LET'S GO TO THE GARDEN OH OH OH OH 
ONCE YOU'RE OUT THERE THEY'RE BOUND TO NEED THE LOO OR SOMETHING 
SO IT ALWAYS ENDS UP BEING SUCH A PAIN 
TO BE HONEST IT WOULD BE NICE JUST TO HAVE A BACK DOOR 
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS I'VE GOT TO GET IT ALL IN AGAIN 
SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES STEVE LONGS FOR MORE SPACE 
AND THE INSPIRATION FOR THE NEW FAMILY HOME IS RIGHT UNDER HIS NOSE 
WHEN I LOOK OUTSIDE MY WINDOW ALL I SEE ARE OTHER HOUSES AND CARS 
WHEN I WATCH PROGRAMMES LIKE THE VICAR OF DIBLEY 
AND THOSE KIND OF COUNTRY PROGRAMMES THAT'S WHAT I WANT 
I CAN PICTURE MYSELF ON A VILLAGE GREEN WITH THE GIRLS MAYBE A DOG PUB FOR ME THAT IS MY LIFE 
LI AND STEVE BOUGHT THEIR HOUSE THREE YEARS AGO FOR TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN THOUSAND 
BEING BRAND NEW THEY HAVE DONE VERY LITTLE TO IT AND THEY HAVE PUT IT BACK ON THE MARKET FOR TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND 
BUILT ACROSS FOUR GARAGES THE FRONT DOOR LEADS TO A STAIRCASE UP TO THE LIVING ACCOMMODATION 
ON THIS FLOOR IS THE FIRST BEDROOM AND THE MAIN FAMILY SHOWER ROOM 
DOWN THE HALL IS A LARGE OPEN PLAN DINING KITCHEN AND LIVING ROOM 
UP A FURTHER STAIRCASE TO THE TOP OF THE HOUSE IS ANOTHER CHILD'S BEDROOM AND FINALLY 
THE MASTER SUITE WITH ITS OWN BATHROOM AND LARGE SLEEPING AREA 
AND ALL THE WAY ROUND THE BACK OF THE HOUSE IS THAT DIFFICULT TO ACCESS GARDEN 
SO STEVE AND LI THE BRILLIANT NEWS IS THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY GOT AN OFFER ON THIS HOUSE 
YES WE'VE MANAGED TO GET AN OFFER WHAT DID YOU ACCEPT 
TWO HUNDRED THIRTY IN THE END HOW DOES THAT COMPARE WITH WHAT YOU PAID THREE YEARS AGO 
IT'S NOT GONE UP SIGNIFICANTLY BUT WE'RE HAPPY WITH IT IN THE END 
THE IMPORTANT THING IS HOW MUCH WE'VE GOT TO SPEND ON YOUR NEXT HOUSE 
THE MAXIMUM WE'D REALLY LIKE TO GO TO IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIVE 
STEVE I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE COMMUTING SO TELL ME WHERE YOU'D LIKE TO MOVE TO 
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AROUND THE KENT ASHFORD AREA 
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TOO MUCH OF A COMMUTE BUT THAT IS A GOOD BASE 
WE NEED TO WRITE A MORE DEFINITE SHOPPING LIST SO LET'S DO OUR ESSENTIALS 
WE'VE GOT THE TWO CHILDREN SO THREE BEDROOMS WOULD BE JUST PERFECT 
I NEED SPACE FOR A STUDIO I'LL BE SETTING UP A PHOTOGRAPHY BUSINESS WHEN WE MOVE 
IT COULD BE A GARAGE THAT I COULD CONVERT THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO HAVE A GARDEN LARGE ENOUGH 
TO TAKE A GARDEN BUILDING LIKE A SUMMER HOUSE WHICH I'M PERFECTLY PREPARED TO PUT IN 
GARDEN IS A FAIRLY ESSENTIAL WORD ISN'T IT YEAH DEFINITELY 
THE LOCATION IS ALMOST AS IMPORTANT AS THE PROPERTY ITSELF 
SCHOOL IS REALLY IMPORTANT EADIE IS IN THE RECEPTION YEAR 
A NICE COUNTRY PUB WOULD BE ONE OF MY ESSENTIALS AS WELL 
OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY IS ABSOLUTELY THE M. TWENTY FIVE AND LAKESIDE 
IT'S A NICE PLACE BUT THERE'S JUST NO COMMUNITY SPIRIT 
I'M NOW GOING TO ALLOW YOU A FEW WISH LIST ITEMS 
IDEALLY WE'D HAVE A STATION THAT I CAN WALK TO 
VIEWS WOULD BE LOVELY IT'S NOT ESSENTIAL BUT VIEWS WOULD BE VERY NICE 
EXCELLENT I'VE GOT A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT ROUND LOOKING FOR EASY BIT FOR YOU NOW 
STAY AT HOME KEEP AN EYE ON WHAT I'M FINDING 
HOPEFULLY I'LL FIND A PROPERTY THAT YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH MARVELLOUS LOVELY 
WELL STEVE AND LI ARE REFRESHINGLY UNUSUAL BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT THAT BOTHERED ABOUT THE PROPERTY ITSELF 
HOWEVER THEY'VE GOT SOME PRETTY HEFTY DEMANDS WHEN IT COMES TO LOCATION 
AN EASY COMMUTE GOOD LOCAL SCHOOLS AND THE ARCHETYPAL VILLAGE 
LET'S HOPE THEY'LL BE PREPARED TO MAKE THE ODD COMPROMISE 
SO THE BROOKMAN FAMILY HAVE A TIGHT BUDGET OF AROUND THREE HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND 
FOR A QUAINT CHARACTER COTTAGE 
THEY'RE AFTER THREE BEDROOMS AND A GARDEN LARGE ENOUGH 
TO HOUSE A STUDIO FOR LI'S PHOTOGRAPHY BUSINESS 
BUT WITH THIS FAMILY IT'S ALL ABOUT THE LOCATION 
THEY'RE AFTER A VICAR OF DIBLEY STYLE VILLAGE WITH SCHOOLS 
SHOPS AND GOOD TRANSPORT LINKS ALL ON THEIR DOORSTEP 
WHEN YOU THINK OF ASHFORD YOU COULD BE FORGIVEN FOR PICTURING A BUSTLING HOME COUNTIES VERSION OF WATERLOO 
KENT'S VERY OWN GATEWAY TO EUROPE VIA THE CHANNEL TUNNEL 
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE TO IT NOT SO MUCH SLICK CITY COMMUTER AS THE DARLING BUDS OF MAY 
BECAUSE OUTSIDE THE TOWN YOU'LL FIND A LANDSCAPE THAT'S DOTTED 
WITH PICTURE POSTCARD VILLAGES OPEN PASTURE AND OASTHOUSES 
AND YOU CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THE ADUNDANCE OF WHITE WEATHERBOARD COTTAGES THAT MAKE UP THE VILLAGES 
HISTORICALLY WHEN WOODLAND WAS CLEARED TO MAKE SPACE FOR SETTLEMENTS 
THE HOUSES WERE BUILT WITH THE READY SUPPLY OF TIMBER 
I'M STARTING MY SEARCH IN IDEN GREEN WHICH IS LOCATED HALFWAY BETWEEN ASHFORD AND TUNBRIDGE WELLS 
MEANWHILE BACK IN CHAFFORD HUNDRED LI AND STEVE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON MY PROGRESS 
IDEN GREEN MAY SEEM A LITTLE ISOLATED AT FIRST BUT LI AND STEVE NEEDN'T WORRY 
I'VE DISCOVERED THAT NOT ONLY IS THIS A GREAT AREA FOR LONDON COMMUTING THERE ARE ALSO LOADS 
OF ACTIVITIES IN THE AREA TO KEEP EVEN THE BUSIEST FAMILY OCCUPIED 
STEVE WILL BE PLEASED TO HEAR THAT THE HAMLET HAS ITS OWN LOCAL PUB 
HURRAH GOOD NEWS FOR YOU YEAH 
MY FIRST PROPERTY WAS BUILT IN TWO THOUSAND TWO 
IN TRADITIONAL WHITE WEATHERBOARDING 
IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND NEAR THE TOP END 
OF LI AND STEVE'S BUDGET THAT'S NOT BAD IS IT IT'S NICE 
THE COTTAGE'S OWNER ULI VON HARWORTH IS SHOWING ME AROUND 
SO THAT'S A HANDY LITTLE AREA THERE ISN'T IT 
MM HMM IT'S GOT ALL YOUR COATS YES FOR SCHOOL BAGS COATS 
LOTS OF STORAGE SO BASICALLY THIS IS ALL VERY OPEN PLAN 
SHALL WE START AT THE KITCHEN END FIRST DO YOU WANT OPEN PLAN AGAIN 
YEAH WELL YOU KNOW 
WE ARE USED TO IT AREN'T WE 
OH LOVELY NEW LOOKING KITCHEN 
IT'S VERY SPACIOUS YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF CUPBOARD SPACE THERE YEAH 
THE HOUSE WAS ONLY BUILT IN TWO THOUSAND TWO YEAH 
LET'S GO BACK THROUGH AND STUDY THE REST OF THE SPACE 
THAT'S NICE SO WHAT'S ACTUALLY RATHER GOOD IS THAT ALTHOUGH IT IS OPEN PLAN THAT'S A GLAZED WALL 
SO YOUR KITCHEN IS SEPARATE REALLY ISN'T IT YES 
SO WHAT DO YOU USE CENTRAL THIS SPACE HERE FOR 
I'VE DECIDED RATHER THAN USING IT AS A DINING ROOM TO KEEP IT AS A PLAY ROOM 
I NOTICE YOU'VE GOT YOUR DINING TABLE IN THE KITCHEN 
BUT EQUALLY STEVE AND LI COULD PUT A PROPER DINING TABLE IN HERE 
I WOULD USE THAT AS A DINING ROOM AND NOT A PLAY ROOM 
AND THEN WE KIND OF FLOW THROUGH INTO YOUR SITTING ROOM PROPER 
THOSE BEAMS ARE GOING TO BE SOMETHING THE KIDS WILL RUN INTO 
THEY'VE TRIED TO GIVE IT PERIOD CHARACTER HAVEN'T THEY 
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT WITH THE FIREPLACE 
NOW I'M GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT SCHOOLS 
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT TWO GIRLS I'M INTERESTED WHERE THEY GO TO SCHOOL 
THEY GO TO THE LOCAL PRIMARY SCHOOL IN BENENDEN 
AND IT'S A FIFTEEN MINUTE WALK UP THE HILL ON THE FOOTPATH 
FIFTEEN MINUTES IS WHAT WE DO HERE IT'S ABSOLUTELY DO ABLE FOR WALKING 
YEAH 
I DO LIKE THIS FEATURE OF THE DOORS OPENING OUT ON TO THE GARDEN 
I'M LESS EXCITED ABOUT THE GARDEN I'M DISAPPOINTED IN THE SIZE 
THAT'S TOO SMALL 
THAT'S FAR TOO SMALL TO THINK ABOUT STICKING THE STUDIO INTO YEAH 
WHICH IS A SHAME A GOOD THING IS IT'S ALL REALLY 
TIGHTLY FENCED SO IT'S DEFINITELY DOT AND EADIE FRIENDLY 
YOU COME UP THE LITTLE STAIRS HERE AND THERE'S A GATE AT THE BACK 
ONTO OFF STREET PARKING WHICH IS ANOTHER GOOD THING 
IT'S JUST THE PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIO WHICH IS A BIT OF A LET DOWN 
HOWEVER STANDING HERE YOU LOOK ON TO OPEN COUNTRYSIDE AND THERE'S A FIELD AT THE BACK HERE 
MAYBE THE NEIGHBOURS WOULD GIVE LI A BIT OF THEIR LAND 
I DOUBT THAT IT'S BE PARTICULARLY SOMETHING WE'D INVESTIGATE 
UPSTAIRS WE HAVE THREE BEDROOMS THE FIRST IS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE 
IT IS SMALL BUT WE ACCEPT WE'LL HAVE SMALLER BEDROOMS FOR THE CHILDREN 
IT'S A STRANGE MIXTURE THEY'VE GOT IN PLACES VERY GOOD HEIGHT CEILINGS AND THERE IS SPACE 
FOR A DOUBLE BED SO IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR ONE OF THE GIRLS AND THEY HAVE GOT LITTLE GIRL SIZED WARDROBES 
POSSIBLY WE COULD FIT THE SMALLEST ONE IN THERE A LITTLE DOT ROOM 
ON DOWN THE CORRIDOR THAT IS A VERY GOOD SIZED STORAGE AND AIRING CUPBOARD 
IN THE CENTRE IS THE SMALLEST OF THE BEDROOMS THAT SEEMS TOTALLY 
YEAH IT DOES SEEM QUITE SMALL YEAH DEFINITELY 
BECAUSE IT'S GOT THAT SLOPING WINDOW YOU'VE GOT BEAUTIFUL VIEWS ACROSS OVER TO BENENDEN 
LOVELY VIEWS BUT I'D BANG MY HEAD ON THAT YOU'D KNOCK YOURSELF OUT 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUSE YOU'VE GOT THE FAMILY BATHROOM 
IT'S NOT A BAD SIZE ALL VERY NICELY FITTED BRAND NEW OF COURSE 
I REALLY NEED A SHOWER I CAN'T BE DEALING WITH BATHS FIRST THING 
RIGHT AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE WE'RE NOW AT THE FRONT OF THE PROPERTY IS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
IT'S GOT REALLY GOOD CEILING HEIGHT 
THAT LOOKS A LOVELY SIZE DOESN'T IT 
NOW WE ARE ON THE ROADSIDE BUT OF COURSE ANOTHER ADVANTAGE 
OF A NEW BUILD HOUSE IS ALL THE WINDOWS ARE DOUBLE GLAZED 
IT'S ALSO GOT GOOD FITTED CUPBOARDS AND LOOK AT THIS 
AN EN SUITE SHOWER ROOM 
NOW BIG BONUS POINTS FOR INNOVATIVE USE OF SPACE 
AT LEAST THERE'S A SHOWER AT LEAST THERE'S A SHOWER IN THE PROPERTY 
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT CAREFUL IN THE SHOWER BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T GOT A LOT OF HEAD HEIGHT 
YOU'RE GONNA BASH YOUR HEAD IN THERE DEFINITELY 
I'VE NOW TRAVELLED EIGHT MILES NORTH TO THE WELL ESTABLISHED 
VILLAGE OF STAPLEHURST BUILT ON A STRETCH OF ROMAN ROAD 
A VILLAGE ONCE RUMOURED TO BE A CENTRE OF WITCHCRAFT 
IT'S SEEN MUCH BRIGHTER DAYS SINCE 
BEING NAMED KENT VILLAGE OF THE YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND THREE 
AS VILLAGES GO STAPLEHURST REALLY IS PRETTY BIG 
ON THE PLUS SIDE IT TICKS A LOT OF BOXES FOR THE BROOKMANS 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF YOUNG FAMILIES LIVING HERE AND LI 
WILL BE INTERESTED TO KNOW IT EVEN HAS ITS OWN PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY 
OOH 
THIS END OF TERRACE COTTAGE IS ON THE MARKET AT JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND 
WHICH WOULD LEAVE LI AND STEVE WITH A GOOD AMOUNT OF SPARE CASH TO PLAY WITH 
I'VE JUST WALKED PAST WHAT LOOKS LIKE THE MAIN FRONT DOOR WHICH OBVIOUSLY ISN'T USED 
NO NOT AT THE MOMENT THERE IS A FRONT DOOR THERE BUT LIKE A LOT OF COTTAGES OF THIS AGE 
THE CURRENT OWNERS USE THEIR SIDE DOOR AS THEIR MAIN ENTRANCE 
HOW BIZARRE THEY'RE NOT USING THE FRONT DOOR 
WHY WOULD YOU 
PERFECTLY ADEQUATE SIDE DOOR FORGET THE FRONT DOOR 
ACTUALLY IT WORKS QUITE WELL BECAUSE YOU DO STEP INTO A HALLWAY 
ESPECIALLY THIS ONE WHICH IS QUITE A LARGE HALLWAY AND TILED WALLS 
THAT IS SLIGHTLY UNUSUAL 
IT MUST'VE BEEN THE FASHION AT THE TIME CHIP THOSE OFF 
I'M WITH CATHERINE WITH THE CHIPPING OFF OF THE THEY'RE COMING OFF TILES 
GOSH I'M GETTING A FEELING OF AGE COMING IN HERE DEFINITE LY 
I REALLY LIKE THOSE BEAMS AND THE FACT THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE NOT BEEN TAMPERED WITH GREATLY 
I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF WEATHERBOARDED HOUSES IN KENT 
SO IT'S REFRESHING TO COME INTO A HALF TIMBERED ONE 
TELL ME ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THIS ONE 
WE BELIEVE IT WAS BUILT AT SOME POINT IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
WE'RE NOT SURE EXACTLY WHEN 
IT WAS PART OF A FARMHOUSE 
RIGHT SO ALL THESE TIMBERS DO YOU THINK THESE ARE ORIGINAL 
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT SO YES 
ORIGINALLY IT WOULD'VE BEEN JUST THESE TWO ROOMS AND UPSTAIRS 
THE BATHROOM AND KITCHEN AREA WOULD'VE BEEN A LATER ADDITION 
RIGHT GOSH SO PRETTY TINY THESE ROOMS 
THEY'RE USING THIS AS A DINING ROOM EFFECTIVELY 
FAIRLY SMALL BUT SPACE FOR FOUR COMFORTABLY 
I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT'S SEVENTEEN CENTURY OPEN PLAN 
IT GIVES IT A BETTER FEELING OF SPACE DOESN'T IT 
DEFINITELY IT WAS TWO ENCLOSED ROOMS IT WOULD FEEL MUCH SMALLER 
THEY'VE GOT THAT CABINET IN FRONT OF THE FRONT DOOR IT SEEMS LIKE A SHAME 
THAT THEY DON'T USE THE FRONT DOOR IT DOES DOESN'T IT 
IT HAS GOT QUITE DECENT PROPORTIONS AND AN IMPRESSIVE FIREPLACE 
THE FIREPLACE IS THE FOCAL POINT OF THE ROOM RIGHT O. K. WE'VE SEEN THE OLDER PART 
SHALL WE GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE NEW EXTENSION 
COULD BE POTENTIALLY TOO SMALL 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN EXTEND OUTWARDS OR WHATEVER 
BUT THAT WOULD BE I FEEL IT WOULD BE A BIT TOO SMALL 
O. K. SO WHAT'S DOWN HERE IT'S THE BATHROOM THROUGH HERE 
O. K. DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM IT ALL LOOKS QUITE NEWLY FITTED IS IT 
THIS IS A NEWLY FITTED WHITE SUITE WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY FASHIONABLE 
ALSO HAS A NEW BOILER IN THE CUPBOARD WHICH IS ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS OLD THAT'S A GOOD THING 
IT'S REASSURING HAVING A BRAND NEW BOILER 
CONSIDERING THE AGE OF THE PROPERTY SHALL WE CARRY ON ROUND THE CORNER 
COMING BACK THROUGH THE HALL BACK TO WHERE WE STARTED AND INTO THE KITCHEN 
THIS IS PART OF WHAT WOULD'VE BEEN THE EXTENSION THIS WOULD'VE BEEN ADDED LATER 
OBVIOUSLY THEY'VE TRIED TO MATCH IT TO THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
YES IN KEEPING WITH THE CHARACTER OF THE FRONT PART OF THE PROPERTY IT'S NOT A BAD SIZED KITCHEN 
IT'S NOT IT'S A USEFUL AREA TO WORK WITH IT'S AN OLD KITCHEN 
IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD USE OF SPACE 
SO WHAT A TRANSFORMATION FROM LI'S CURRENT SITUATION HAVING TO 
RUN UP AND DOWN ALL THOSE STAIRS TO HER GARDEN BECAUSE SHE CAN COME STRAIGHT OUT FROM THE KITCHEN 
IT'D BE PERFECT FOR DOT AND EADIE 
THERE IS ONE THIRTY F. T. OF GARDEN HERE 
THAT GARDEN IS A GREAT SIZE 
THAT IS MASSIVE REALLY GOOD SIZED GARDEN 
LI'S REALLY INTO HER LOVELY HOME GROWN FRUIT AND VEG 
WELL SHE CAN GROW HER OWN BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO A VEGETABLE PATCH 
SORRY WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING 
I'VE SEEN YOU WITH PLANTS IN THE HOUSE 
COME ON I DO WELL WITH HERBS 
I LOVE THIS BIG CHUNKY MULE POST AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS 
I'M NOT SURE HOW CHILD FRIENDLY THEY ARE BECAUSE THERE IS A BIT OF A DROP THERE 
OR EQUALLY HOW TALL ADULT FRIENDLY THEY ARE BECAUSE YOU NEED TO MIND YOUR HEAD ON THAT 
BUT THAT IS THE JOY OF PERIOD COTTAGES 
YOU CAN STICK A BANISTER UP THERE THAT'S NOT SO MUCH OF AN ISSUE NO 
ALL THE BEDROOMS ARE IN THE OLDER PART OF THE HOUSE 
THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT THEY DO HAVE SLIGHTLY LOW CEILINGS 
THE UP SIDE IS THAT THEY HAVE KIND OF QUIRKY CHARACTER TO THEM 
I QUITE LIKE THE FIRE 
I LOVE THE FIREPLACE THAT'S LOVELY THE BARE BRICK WALL IS JUST LOVELY 
BEDROOM TWO IS PRETTY SMALL 
BUT IT IS QUITE CHARMING IT'S GOT SOME LOVELY PERIOD CHARACTER 
NICE OLD FLOORBOARDS AND I LOVE THESE OLD DOORS 
REALLY LIKE THE BARE BRICK I REALLY LIKE THE 
THE FLOORBOARDS ARE BEAUTIFUL I THINK IT IS LOVELY 
IT IS OBVIOUSLY SMALL 
IF LI AND STEVE THINK THAT THE BEDROOMS IN THIS PROPERTY ARE A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING 
I HOPE THIS ONE IS GOING TO CHANGE THEIR MIND BECAUSE I LOVE THIS 
YEAH THAT IS A GREAT ROOM IT'S LOVELY IT IS LOVELY 
I CAN SEE YOU FALLING DOWN THOSE STAIRS AT SOME POINT 
THIS IS A DEATH TRAP IT'S ANTI STEVE I'M TELLING YOU 
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD SIZE YOU'RE KIND OF BRUSHING SIX FOOT ON THE HEAD HEIGHT BUT OTHERWISE 
PLENTY OF SPACE FOR A BIG DOUBLE BED LOADS OF LIGHT FLOODING IN THROUGH THE WINDOWS 
AS A CHARACTER PROPERTY IT'S VERY LOVELY IT DOES CONCERN ME THAT 
I AM GONNA BE CONSTANTLY BANGING MY HEAD AND HAVING TO STOOP DOWN 
IT'S DAY TWO OF MY SEARCH AND I'VE TRAVELLED TO THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY 
VILLAGE OF WOODCHURCH SEVEN MILES SOUTH OF ASHFORD 
OOH THAT'S MORE LIKE IT OOH THAT LOOKS NICE 
I'VE HAD A LOOK AROUND AND IT SEEMS THAT WOODCHURCH NOT ONLY 
HAS BAGS OF COMMUNITY FEELING BUT ALSO ALL THE AMENITIES THAT STEVE AND LI ARE HOPING FOR 
JUST BEHIND ME IN THAT DIRECTION THERE'S THE LOCAL PRIMARY SCHOOL AND NO LESS THAN TWO LOCAL PUBS 
AND DOWN IN THAT DIRECTION YOU'VE GOT TRADITIONAL VILLAGE SHOPS 
WOODCHURCH HAS MORE LISTED BUILDINGS THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN KENT INCLUDING THE IMPRESSIVE 
NINETEENTH CENTURY WINDMILL THAT OVERLOOKS THE VILLAGE 
IT CLOSED NEARLY ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND IS ONE OF THE FEW WINDMILLS LEFT STANDING IN KENT TODAY 
ANOTHER LISTED BUILDING IN THE CENTRE OF WOODCHURCH IS THE NEXT PROPERTY I'M SHOWING LI AND STEVE 
THE WHITE HOUSE IS ON THE MARKET FOR NEARLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
ANOTHER WEATHERBOARDED HOUSE 
GOOD JOB WE LIKE IT 
THE OWNER MARK IS SHOWING ME AROUND HELLO NICE TO SEE YOU 
QUITE ON THE ROADSIDE BUT I LOVE ITS SYMMETRY AND THE LITTLE DOOR IN THE MIDDLE 
DO YOU USE THAT MUCH NO WE USE THE BACK WAY 
WHY DO THESE PEOPLE ALWAYS USE BACK DOORS AND SIDE DOORS 
WHY WOULD YOU USE THE FRONT DOOR HOW FUNNY 
THIS IS YOUR DRIVEWAY HERE SHARED ACCESS DRIVE 
SHALL WE GO ROUND AND HAVE A LOOK AT THAT FIRST 
SO THIS IS YOUR ACCESS THAT YOU SHARE WITH THIS NEIGHBOUR YEAH 
AND DOES THAT GARAGE BELONG TO THAT HOUSE IT DOES YES 
WHERE EXACTLY IS YOUR PARKING HERE MARK THIS IS THE PARKING AREA 
TWO TO THREE CARS AND THERE IS SCOPE TO PUT A GARAGE AS WELL 
THAT'S PERFECT IT'S JUST WHAT THEY WANTED IN TERMS OF THE VIEW THE SURROUNDINGS 
LOVELY VIEWS AND STUFF TERRIFIC 
SO WHERE EXACTLY IS YOUR GARDEN JUST ROUND THIS WAY 
IT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY NICE LITTLE GARDEN 
YOU DON'T LOOK AS IF YOU'RE TOO OVERLOOKED NO YOU'VE GOT NO NEIGHBOURS OVERLOOKING AT ALL 
EXCELLENT NICE LITTLE SPACE THERE 
BUT I THINK THIS IS THE THING THAT REALLY SOLD IT TO ME AND HOPEFULLY TO LI IS YOUR SUMMER HOUSE 
THIS IS WHAT I'M THINKING OF AS THE PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIO 
LOVELY THEY'VE PUT ONE OUT THERE FOR ME ALREADY 
DID YOU PUT THIS IN MARK IT WAS ORIGINALLY HERE AND WE'VE JUST RECLAD IT AND RE ROOFED IT 
IT'S IN REALLY GOOD ORDER IT IS 
IT'S LIKE A LITTLE DIDDY VERSION OF YOUR HOUSE WHICH IS RATHER NICE 
LET'S GET INSIDE AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE HOUSE NICE AND WARM IN HERE 
THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO TAKE COATS AND HATS OFF 
THIS IS LIKE A LITTLE LEAN TO IT IS 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT THROUGH HERE 
THROUGH THERE THE DOWNSTAIRS TOILET EXCELLENT 
WORTH HAVING A DOWNSTAIRS LOO 
THIS MUST BE THE KITCHEN IS IT IT IS 
INTO THE KITCHEN NOW THIS IS ALL LOOKING VERY NEW AND LOVELY 
THAT'S A CRACKING KITCHEN LOOK AT THE ROOM YOU'VE GOT 
AM I RIGHT THAT THE HOUSE DATES BACK TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THAT'S RIGHT 
YOU'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD EATING AREA THERE WHICH WOULD BE PERFECT FOR LI AND STEVE AND THE TWO GIRLS 
AND THIS IS KIND OF YOUR WORKING KITCHEN DOWN HERE 
I LOVE THE BIG BELFAST SINK WE'VE KEPT THE ORIGINAL BUTLER'S SINK 
LOVELY SINK REALLY NICE 
NICE FEATURE I LIKE THAT A LOT 
THERE'S A NICE BLEND OF SOME OF THE OLD FEATURES AND A NICE MODERN GLOSS ON TOP OF IT 
YES FOR MODERN DAY LIVING 
RIGHT I THINK MY FAMILY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GET THEIR HEADS AROUND COTTAGE PROPORTIONS 
BECAUSE THEY ARE LIVING IN A BIG OPEN PLAN SPACE AT THE MOMENT 
IT IS A QUESTION OF LOOKING AT LOTS OF DIFFERENT LITTLE ROOMS 
IT IS ALL NEW ISN'T IT MM 
THE FIREPLACE IS LOVELY YOU CAN FIT IN REASONABLE SOFAS SO IT DOESN'T LOOK THAT SMALL THAT AREA DOES IT 
NO IT DOESN'T AS YOU SAY IT DOES LOOK ALL NEW SO YOU'RE LOSING ALL OF THE PERIOD FEATURES 
WHAT I NOTICED FROM THE OUTSIDE AND I IMAGINE THIS IS PARTLY DUE TO THE GRADE THE SECOND LISTING 
IS YOU KEPT THE ORIGINAL WINDOWS WE HAD THEM RE WEIGHTED 
BEAUTIFUL WINDOWS THEY'RE FANTASTIC AREN'T THEY REALLY NICE 
AND THEY ARE SO PLEASING LOTS OF NATURAL LIGHT COMING IN RIGHT 
IF WE CARRY ON AND GO ROUND IN A CIRCLE INTO THE FINAL ROOM 
THIS IS YOUR LITTLE HALLWAY BASICALLY 
AND THAT IS THE DOOR THAT YOU DON'T USE STAIRS WHICH I WILL COME BACK TO IN A MINUTE 
THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE USING AS A DINING ROOM 
THAT'S A GREAT ROOM AS WELL 
YOU COULD HAVE THAT AS A DINING ROOM PLAYROOM FOR THE KIDS 
WE'RE AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE LOOKING OUT OVER THE VILLAGE STREET YEAH 
THE OTHER THING I NOTICED FIREPLACES IN BOTH ROOMS 
ARE THEY OPEN YES SWEPT AND READY TO GO 
FANTASTIC THAT'S NICE ISN'T IT I DIDN'T THINK THE OTHER ONE WAS OPEN THAT'S REALLY NICE 
WHAT REALLY PLEASES ME ABOUT THIS HOUSE IS THE SYMMETRY OF IT 
UPSTAIRS YOU HAVE THREE BEDROOMS WHICH OPEN UP OFF THIS LITTLE LANDING HERE 
THE FIRST ONE IS OVER THE LOUNGE 
I AM PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BECAUSE FOR A COTTAGE THIS IS A REALLY DECENT SIZED BEDROOM 
IT'D MAKE A LOVELY MASTER BEDROOM FOR STEVE AND LI 
AND THE ADDED BONUS IS THAT THERE IS A GOOD INTEGRATED FITTED CUPBOARD AS WELL 
IT'S QUITE BLAND IN THE WAY HE HAS CHOSEN TO DO IT BUT IT'S EXACTLY LIKE A NEW HOUSE INSIDE 
YES THERE IS THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE THAT MORE INTERESTING 
ACROSS THE HALLWAY THERE IS AN EQUALLY SIZED BEDROOM AGAIN AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
YOU CAN CHANGE THE RADIATORS ADD FLOORBOARDS IN THERE 
YOU'VE GOT THE BARE BONES REALLY HAVEN'T YOU 
THE THIRD BEDROOM IS THE SMALLEST BUT IT STILL WOULD BE REALLY GOOD FOR EITHER DOT OR EADIE 
GOOD SIZED BEDROOM FOR THE GIRLS 
ANOTHER STORAGE CUPBOARD HERE NOW THIS IS PROBABLY THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE UPSTAIRS 
IT'S A VERY FUNKY FITTED NEW BATHROOM MARK PUT THIS IN 
IT IS QUITE LARGE FOR A COTTAGE IT IS A NICE SIZE 
IT SEEMS NICE AND OPEN 
THE BEST PART ABOUT IT FOR ME IS THAT FROM HERE YOU CAN LIE IN THE BATH 
AND LOOK OUT ONTO OPEN COUNTRYSIDE 
I REALLY DO LIKE THE HOUSE I LIKE THE WAY IT'S LAID OUT 
I LIKE THE SIZES OF THE ROOMS 
I LIKE THE FEATURES THAT REMAIN AND I REALLY LIKE STUDIO IN THE GARDEN AND THE OUTSIDE 
YEAH THAT IS FANTASTIC OBVIOUSLY IT DOES LOOK VERY NEW INSIDE BUT WE ARE USED TO THAT SO 
I THINK THAT IS THE DOWNSIDE 
FOR MY FINAL PROPERTY I HAVE TRAVELLED FIVE MILES NORTH TO THE BEAUTIFUL VILLAGE OF BETHERSDEN 
HEY THE FAMILY BUTCHER 
HISTORICALLY THE VILLAGE TRADED IN WOOL BUT ITS MOST FAMOUS EXPORT 
IS LOCAL STONE WHICH IS FOUND IN THE WALLS OF CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL 
THESE DAYS BETHERSDEN IS BEST KNOWN FOR SELLING WOOD IN THE FORM OF ROCKING HORSES 
BETHERSDEN IS ONLY SIX MILES FROM ASHFORD WHICH MAKES IT 
EXCELLENT FOR COMMUTING AND FOR THE SENIOR SCHOOLS THERE 
IT STILL FEELS REALLY RURAL A PROPER COUNTRY VILLAGE WITH PUBS 
TRADITIONAL SHOPS AND A CRICKET PITCH 
LAUREL COTTAGE IS ON THE MARKET FOR JUST BELOW THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
AND IT'S ANOTHER WHITE BOARDED PROPERTY 
THIS SEVENTEENTH CENTURY GRADE THE SECOND LISTED COTTAGE IS POSITIONED RIGHT IN THE HUB OF THE VILLAGE 
NO FRONT DOOR 
VERY KENTISH 
HOME OWNER JUSTINE KINGSLAND IS GOING TO SHOW ME AROUND 
THERE SEEMS TO BE A THEME IN KENT THAT YOU DON'T COME IN THE FRONT DOOR YOU COME IN THE BACK DOOR 
IT'S FAR EASIER 
ESPECIALLY ON THE MAIN ROAD 
WE FIND IT MUCH EASIER BUT ACTUALLY THIS IS A PROPER HALLWAY ISN'T IT 
ALMOST LIKE COMING IN THROUGH A FRONT DOOR LET'S HEAD IN THIS DIRECTION 
VERY NICE KITCHEN YES 
SOME NICE FEATURES WITH BEAMS AND STUFF 
QUITE A REASONABLE SIZED KITCHEN I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE TABLE IT SEEMS TO REALLY CUT DOWN THE SPACE 
HOW DO YOU FIND IT IN TERMS OF PRACTICAL FAMILY LIFE 
IT'S GREAT 
I THINK IT'S JUST A BIT DATED THAT LOOK THE STYLE OF THE KITCHEN 
BUT THESE THINGS CAN ALWAYS BE CHANGED AT SOME POINT 
NOW THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS ON LI'S BONUS LIST IS THAT STAYING 
YES SORT OF NEGOTIABLE 
BUT IT CERTAINLY CAN STAY YES 
THE RANGE IS JUST FANTASTIC THAT IS LOVELY 
ARE THERE OTHER DINING OPTIONS YES THE DINING ROOM IS THROUGH THERE LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THAT 
PROPER ADULT GROWN UP DINING ROOM WHICH YOU DO NOT SEE VERY OFTEN 
I LIKE THAT ROOM IT IS QUITE DARK IN THE WAY THEY HAVE DECORATED IT BUT THAT IS EASILY REMEDIED 
AND IS THAT AN OPEN FIRE THAT IS A GAS FIRE RIGHT CHEATS 
YES WE SAVE THE REAL THING FOR NEXT DOOR 
GAS FIRE 
THESE ARE ALWAYS THINGS YOU CAN CHANGE WITH TIME OR NOT 
SO WE CAN CARRY ON ROUND IN A CIRCLE THROUGH HERE 
SO STEP UP INTO THE SITTING ROOM THIS IS RATHER LOVELY IT DOESN'T FEEL COTTAGEY ACTUALLY 
IT HAS A VERY ELEGANT FEEL TO IT IT IS MORE OF A FORMAL ROOM 
THE ROOM ITSELF IS VERY LOVELY IT IS NICE WITH THE BEAMS 
HAVE YOU DONE A LOT WHILE YOU'VE BEEN HERE 
YES WE HAVE BEEN THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE REDECORATED 
MAGNIFICENT FIREPLACE THIS IS THE ONE THAT'S OPEN YES WE USE THAT A LOT 
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT IT BECOMES LOVELY AND COSY IN HERE 
THE FIREPLACE IS LOVELY 
IT'S LOVELY TO ACTUALLY HAVE ONE THAT IS A WORKING FIREPLACE 
WE'RE AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE HERE SO WE ARE UP ON THE ROADSIDE 
I MENTION THE ROAD BECAUSE IT IS SLIGHTLY BUSIER THAN I WAS EXPECTING IS THIS THE A TWENTY EIGHT 
YES INTO ASHFORD 
YOU DO GET USED TO IT 
AND WE HAVE HAD SECONDARY GLAZING PUT IN AS WELL O. K. 
THAT IS TO STOP THE SOUND AND KEEP YOU NICE AND TOASTY WARM AS WELL 
I'M A BIT DISTURBED ABOUT THE WINDOWS 
WHAT HAVE THEY DONE 
SECONDARY GLAZING WHICH IS JUST WHERE THEY HAVE PUT SOMETHING INSIDE I GUESS YES 
BACK TO THE HALLWAY 
ONE FINAL DOOR TO HAVE A LOOK IN WHAT'S IN HERE 
THAT'S THE FAMILY BATHROOM LOVELY VERY SWANKY I LIKE THAT 
I LIKE THAT BATHROOM I MIGHT TAKE ISSUE WITH THE WALLPAPER 
IT IS VERY GIRLY I LOVE IT 
THE ONE THING THAT IS NOT IN ITS FAVOUR IS THAT IT IS DOWNSTAIRS 
WE DO HAVE THE EN SUITE IN BEDROOM ONE SO YOU'VE GOT ONE ON EACH FLOOR 
LOVELY CHARACTER AND IT IS NO PROBLEM BEING DOWNSTAIRS 
THERE ARE THREE BEDROOMS IN THIS HOUSE 
THE FIRST TWO ARE PRETTY IDENTICALLY SIZED PERFECT FOR DOT AND EADIE 
THIS ONE HAS GOT A DOUBLE BED IN IT BUT YOU COULD TAKE THAT OUT 
AND HAVE PLENTY OF PLAY SPACE AS WELL 
AND IT HAS ALREADY GOT PINK SPOTTED WALLPAPER 
IT IS A DOTTY ROOM FOR DOTTY IT IS YES 
AND NEXT DOOR THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE GIRL'S ROOM 
PERFECT FOR EITHER DOT OR EADIE TO TAKE IT OVER 
EADIE'S NAME IS ALL OVER THAT 
FINALLY THE MASTER BEDROOM 
THIS IS THE LOWEST DOOR IN THE WHOLE HOUSE 
BUT ONCE YOU'RE IN IT HAS GOT VERY GOOD CEILING HEIGHT 
I THINK THIS IS A PERFECT COMBINATION BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT PERIOD CHARACTER 
WITH ALL THIS BEAMAGE HERE 
IT FEELS LIKE A GOOD PRACTICAL MASTER BEDROOM 
THAT IS A GOOD SIZED ROOM 
THAT IS VERY NICE 
I LOVE THAT THE LITTLE DOOR 
IN HERE THERE'S A FEATURE WHICH IN ITSELF WOULD SELL THE HOUSE TO ME 
AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY STYLE WALK IN WARDROBE 
WALK IN WARDROBE THAT WOULD BE CONVENIENT THAT'S FOR ME 
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY HIDDEN BONUS IN THIS ROOM BECAUSE BEHIND THIS LITTLE DOOR IS 
AN EN SUITE BATHROOM 
ADMITTEDLY IT IS VERY DIDDY 
AND YOU'D BE BEST ADVISED NOT TO JUMP UP AND DOWN WHEN YOU'RE IN THE SHOWER 
I JUST THINK YOU NEED TO SHRINK CUT MY LEGS OFF 
BUT GIVEN THAT THE MAIN BATHROOM IS DOWNSTAIRS 
IT DOES TRANSFORM THE PRACTICALITIES OF THIS PROPERTY 
I THINK THAT EN SUITE IS LOVELY IT IS 
IN BETWEEN BEING BUSY INSIDE THE HOUSE JUSTINE'S ALSO HAD TIME TO TRANSFORM THE GARDEN 
AND HER AIM WAS TO MAKE A FAMILY FRIENDLY SPACE WHICH IS PERFECT FOR THE BOOKMANS 
FOR STARTERS YOU'VE GOT A LOVELY STABLE DOOR THERE GIVING THEM DIRECT ACCESS OUT TO THEIR GARDEN 
NICE PATIO AREA HERE 
THROUGH THE LITTLE ARCHWAY IT'S MOSTLY LAID TO LAWN 
THERE'S A CHILDREN'S PLAY AREA WHICH DOT AND EADIE ARE GOING TO FALL IN LOVE WITH 
THAT IS A REALLY NICE GARDEN IT'S FANTASTIC A LOT OF THOUGHT GONE INTO THAT 
AND ROUND THE CORNER HERE WE'VE GOT A DECKED AREA WITH NO LESS THAN WITH A HOT TUB 
NOW THAT'S AVAILABLE BY SEPARATE NEGOTIATION IF STEVE AND LI REALLY FANCY IT 
I'M A FAN OF THE HOT TUB 
GOODNESS ME HOT TUB 
WOW 
SO YOU MIGHT THINK THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE OUT HERE TO PUT A PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIO 
BUT YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO BECAUSE IN HERE 
THIS WAS THE DOUBLE GARAGE BUT JUSTINE'S BEEN BUSY IN THERE TOO SHE'S CONVERTED IT 
SO THAT DOWNSTAIRS SHE'S GOT A UTILITY AREA AND A GYM SPACE 
UPSTAIRS THERE'S A SMALL OFFICE AND A LITTLE DEN FOR THE CHILDREN 
SO THE GYM TO ME WOULD MAKE THE PERFECT STUDIO 
THIS HAS GOT TO BE A BIG BONUS FOR THIS PROPERTY 
PERFECT FOR WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE I KNOW 
HAVING SEEN ALL FOUR PROPERTIES LI AND STEVE MUST DECIDE WHICH TWO 
THEY WANT TO CHECK OUT FOR THEMSELVES 
BEECH COTTAGE IS ON THE MARKET FOR TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
AND BENEFITS FROM BEING A RELATIVELY MODERN LOW MAINTENANCE PROPERTY 
SPACE MAY BE A PROBLEM BOTH IN THE BEDROOMS AND IN THE SMALL GARDEN 
THE END OF TERRACE COTTAGE IN STAPLEHURST HAS A MUCH LARGER GARDEN 
AND AMPLE ROOM FOR THE STUDIO LI 
AT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND IT STILL NEEDS A FAIR BIT OF WORK DOING TO IT 
AND ITS BUILT UP LOCATION MAY NOT BE THE VICAR OF DIBLEY VILLAGE 
THE FAMILY ARE AFTER 
THE WHITE HOUSE IS IN A MUCH MORE SLEEPY VILLAGE 
AND HAS THE SPACE LI AND STEVE ARE AFTER INSIDE AND OUT 
BUT IT HAS BEEN RECENTLY RENOVATED 
AND THOSE CHARACTER FEATURES THEY'RE AFTER ARE LESS OBVIOUS HERE 
IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR FIFTY SHY OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
FINALLY LAUREL COTTAGE 
WHICH OOZES CHARACTER AND HAS A LARGE STUDIO AND GARDEN 
BUT IT'S ON A BUSY ROAD AND IS NEAR THE TOP END OF THEIR BUDGET 
AT JUST UNDER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE GOT RIGHT BEECH COTTAGE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
ER 
NOT REALLY NO THAT'S A NO REALLY 
STAPLEHURST HOUSE THAT WAS ONE WITH ALL THE BEAMS WASN'T IT 
AND THE MAIN ROAD 
I DIDN'T GET THE WARM FEELING ABOUT BEING IN THE COUNTRY 
IT JUST SEEMS A BIT TOO BUILT UP FOR ME AT THE MOMENT 
THE WHITE HOUSE 
I LIKED THE WHITE HOUSE 
ALTHOUGH WE DID FEEL THAT IT LACKED SOME OF THE CHARACTER 
I LIKED THAT I LIKED THE PLACE 
SO THAT'S MAYBE 
YES DEFINITELY 
LAUREL COTTAGE 
THAT'S PROBABLY MY FAVOURITE YOU'VE GOT THE SUMMER HOUSE 
OR GARAGE THAT'S BEEN CONVERTED I THINK FOR YOU THAT WOULD BE PERFECT 
YES I WOULD AGREE 
IT HAS GOT THOSE MORE TRADITIONAL FEATURES THAT YOU'D EXPECT TO FIND IN A COTTAGE 
YES I THOUGHT IT WAS LOVELY SO THAT'S A DEFINITE DEFINITE 
SO IT'S THE WHITE HOUSE AND LAUREL COTTAGE 
WONDERFUL 
HAVING CHOSEN THEIR FAVOURITE TWO COTTAGES 
LI AND STEVE JOIN ME IN KENT HOPING TO FIND THEIR VERY OWN DIBLEY 
AND SO FAR SO GOOD AS WE HEAD TO WOODCHURCH 
SO HERE'S THE FIRST PROPERTY THE WHITE HOUSE FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
I THINK IT LOOKS LOVELY PRETTY YEAH 
YOU HAVE GOT THE ROAD HERE IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT 
IT DOESN'T SEEM A MAIN ROAD SO IT'S PROBABLY NOT TOO BUSY JUST BEAR IT IN MIND 
SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO LET'S GET ACROSS AND HAVE A LOOK LOVELY 
WE'RE BREAKING WITH KENTISH TRADITION COMING IN THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR 
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ALLOWED NO 
THIS IS YOUR SITTING ROOM LI WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S A NICE ROOM YES IT'S A NICE SIZE 
IT IS A NICE SIZE INITIALLY I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A BIT NARROWER 
BUT IT IS ACTUALLY QUITE A NICE SIZE ISN'T IT 
NICE WINDOWS NICE WINDOWS YES LOVELY OLD PROPER WINDOWS 
YEAH LOVELY FIREPLACE AS WELL 
FOLLOW ME THROUGH HERE 
IN FACT I'LL LET YOU GO FIRST AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE KITCHEN 
IT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY NICE SIZE 
YOU CAN SEE THE CABINETS THERE THE CUPBOARDS ARE LOVELY 
LOTS OF SPACE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE WE'RE CONSTRAINED WITH AT THE MOMENT 
I LOVE THE SINK AS WELL YEAH THAT WAS ORIGINAL TO THE COTTAGE 
SO HE'S BUILT THE KITCHEN AROUND THE SINK WHICH IS A REALLY NICE FEATURE 
SO THIS IS YOUR PRACTICAL COOKING END 
AND THIS IS YOUR SEATING END IT'S LOVELY YOU'VE GOT SO MUCH ROOM IN HERE 
YEAH QUITE A SURPRISE WHAT DO YOU THINK THE GIRLS WOULD THINK OF IT I THINK THEY'D REALLY LIKE IT 
LOTS OF SPACE TO GAMBLE ABOUT REALLY YEAH YES DEFINITELY 
IF YOU WANTED TO ADD MORE SPACE IN THE FUTURE THERE'S THIS LEAN TO HERE 
WHICH BECAUSE IT'S AN EXISTING STRUCTURE WOULD BE VERY EASY TO GET PLANNING PERMISSION 
RIGHT TO DO A PROPER EXTENSION 
THE CURRENT OWNERS LOOKED INTO THAT SO IT'S DEFINITELY A POSSIBILITY 
GREAT WELL LET'S CARRY ON COS WE CAN GO IN A CIRCLE DINING ROOM NEXT 
MIND YOUR HEAD 
ACTUALLY FOR A COTTAGE YOU'VE GOT REALLY GOOD HEAD HEIGHT HERE 
YOU DON'T FEEL CRAMPED AT ALL WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS ROOM THE DECOR 
IT'S NOT REALLY TO MY TASTE BUT IT'S EASILY CHANGED I THINK 
IT'S GOT A LOT MORE CHARACTER THAN IT APPEARED TO 
WHEN WE FIRST LOOKED AT IT ON THE LAPTOP 
THE DOOR FRAMES AND THE FIREPLACE I THINK IT'S LOVELY 
SO YOU FEEL IT HAS RETAINED THAT AGE THAT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU 
JUST SMALLER DETAILS THAT YOU MISS OUT ON ON THE LAPTOP REALLY 
DO YOU THINK YOU'D USE IT AS A DINING ROOM I THINK SO YEAH YEAH 
WE'VE GOT QUITE A LARGE TABLE ABOUT THE SAME KIND OF SIZE 
IT IS NICE TO GET AWAY FROM THE KITCHEN AND EAT IN A DIFFERENT ROOM 
I'M GOING TO LET THE TWO OF YOU HAVE TIME TO ABSORB ALL OF IT SO HEAD OFF UPSTAIRS AND WE'LL MEET LATER 
GREAT LOVELY BYE BYE 
THIS IS A GREAT BATHROOM LOOK AT THAT BATH REALLY PRACTICAL FOR THE KIDS 
THEY CAN BOTH GET SEPARATE SIDES OF IT 
THERE'S SOME GREAT VIEWS OUT THERE AS WELL 
AND A SEPARATE SHOWER WHICH IS A REAL BONUS 
ABSOLUTELY WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR 
I THINK THE STUDIO SPACE IS REALLY NICE 
IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD TO USE IT 
YEAH AND THE GARDEN'S A GREAT SIZE YOU'RE NOT OVERLOOKED YOU'VE GOT PRIVACY FANTASTIC VIEWS 
IT'S LOVELY 
HI HI HI SO YOU'VE SEEN THE WHOLE THING WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT 
VERY NICE WE REALLY LIKE IT ACTUALLY 
I THINK WHEN WE SAW IT ON THE LAPTOP WE WERE A BIT CONCERNED IT LACKED SOME CHARACTER 
BUT HAVING SEEN IT IN THE FLESH ALL THE DETAILS THAT WE HADN'T PICKED UP ON 
ON THE LAPTOP ALL OUR WORRIES HAVE BEEN IT'S LOVELY 
SO THE WHITE HOUSE IS LOOKING POSITIVE LET'S HEAD OFF TO THE NEXT VILLAGE GREAT O. K. 
SO HERE WE ARE IN BETHERSDEN FOR LAUREL COTTAGE 
SO THIS IS THE HOUSE WHAT'S YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS FROM THE OUTSIDE 
VERY NICE I'M A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THE ROAD 
YES IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY AN A ROAD 
IT IS FAIRLY BUSY BUT I THINK THE HOUSE MAKES UP FOR IT 
THIS IS THE TOP OF YOUR DRIVE SO IN TERMS OF THE GIRLS YOU COULD GATE IT 
SO THAT THERE'S NO WORRY OF THEM RUNNING OUT ONTO IT OR ANYTHING 
ANYWAY LET'S GO INSIDE AND HAVE A LOOK AROUND 
RIGHT SO BEFORE WE GO IN THE HOUSE I THOUGHT I'D JUST SHOW YOU THE GARDEN 
IT'S A GREAT SIZE ISN'T IT IT'S VERY PRETTY 
HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO THE OTHER ONE 
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT MORE ESTABLISHED THERE'S A LOT MORE TO IT 
IT'S GOT ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT AREAS 
THERE'S QUITE A DINKY LITTLE AREA AT THE BACK THERE FOR THE GIRLS 
THE ALL IMPORTANT GARAGE BUT I'LL LET YOU LOOK AT THAT LATER AND THEN THIS 
WA HEY THE HOT TUB 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT HAVING A HOT TUB IN YOUR GARDEN 
OH DEFINITELY I'LL BE UP FOR IT 
I'M NOT REALLY SURE 
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF PERSUASION 
IF STEVE'S GONNA GET HIS HOT TUB 
RIGHT LET'S GO INSIDE AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE HOUSE ITSELF LOVELY FOLLOW ME 
IN WE COME 
SO LET'S GO THIS WAY FIRST O. K. 
THE ALL IMPORTANT KITCHEN SEE WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS 
IT'S LOVELY ISN'T IT LOVELY SIZE 
REALLY NICE AND PARTICULARLY I LIKE THE OVEN 
I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE THAT THAT WAS ONE OF YOUR BONUS THINGS IT WAS THAT'S GORGEOUS 
WHAT ABOUT THE LAYOUT OF THE KITCHEN WOULD IT WORK FOR YOU IN TERMS OF FAMILY LIFE 
YEAH ALTHOUGH WHEN WE WERE WATCHING ON THE LAPTOP WE DID THINK THIS WAS UNNECESSARY IN HERE 
JUST SEEMS TO MAKE THE ROOM A LOT SMALLER AND I'D STICK WITH THAT 
SO YOU'D GET RID OF THIS ALTOGETHER YEAH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN WHAT ABOUT THE STYLE OF IT 
IT IS SOMETHING I WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE I THINK 
IN THE LONG TERM BUT IN THE SHORT TERM IT'S VERY PRACTICAL 
NICE SINK LOVELY SINK 
IT LEADS ON INTO THE DINING ROOM YOU GO AND HAVE A LOOK 
OH THESE DOORS 
YES NOW THEN STEVE THESE DOORS I'M DUCKING AGAIN 
I QUITE LIKE THIS ROOM YEAH THE BEAMS ARE VERY LOVELY THEY ARE 
AND THE FIREPLACE AS WELL THIS DINING ROOM IS INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE WE SAW THIS MORNING 
WHICH ONE DO YOU PREFER DO YOU THINK IN A WAY I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THE ONE FROM THIS MORNING 
AND THE REASON WHY IS JUST BECAUSE IT FELT A MUCH LIGHTER AND OPEN SPACE 
YOU COULD JUST PAINT THE WALLS AND MAY BE BRIGHTEN IT UP A BIT 
THE FURNITURE'S QUITE DARK IN HERE AS WELL I SUPPOSE 
IT HAS THAT OLD FEEL ABOUT IT 
YEAH SO AGAIN LOTS OF CHARACTER 
YES YES LOTS OF IT I DO REALLY LIKE THE BEAMS 
GOOD AND AS STEVE'S GOT CLEARANCE ON THEM YEAH 
I THINK THEY'RE GONNA PASS EXCELLENT IF YOU GO THROUGH THAT DOOR 
THAT LEADS YOU INTO THE SITTING ROOM 
THIS IS NICE IT IS NICE THE FIREPLACE IS SUPERB 
LOVELY FIREPLACE 
IT'S A LOVELY SIZE ROOM THOUGH ISN'T IT IT IS A NICE BIG WINDOW 
THIS IS WHERE THEY PUT IN THE GLASS AS WELL 
YES THE SECONDARY GLASS 
SO THESE ARE THE ORIGINAL FRAMES 
RIGHT BUT BECAUSE OF THE ROAD NOISE THEY'VE PUT IN DOUBLE GLAZING WHICH ISN'T THE PRETTIEST THING NO 
SO SPEAKING OF THE ROAD WE'VE BEEN IN THE HOUSE A LITTLE WHILE 
HOW HAVE YOU FOUND THE ROAD NOISE 
I'VE BEEN QUITE AWARE OF IT I THINK 
YEAH I'M CONSCIOUS OF IT 
IT DOESN'T SEEM AS IDYLLIC AS I WOULD WANT 
I DON'T IF IT'S BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A QUIET STREET AT THE MOMENT 
WE'RE NOT USED TO THE TRAFFIC NOISE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S JUST BECAUSE 
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S LOADS MORE TO SEE 
SO HAVE A REALLY GOOD EXPLORE AND WE'LL GET TOGETHER LATER GREAT 
QUAINT BUT IT'S NOT TERRIBLY PRACTICAL IS IT 
IT REALLY IS A LOVELY ROOM BUT IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE WITH THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIT IN THE SHOWER 
IT'S A GOOD STUDIO SPACE IT NEEDS TO BE TIDIED UP A LITTLE BIT 
IT'S LOVELY SORT IT OUT GET RID OF THE GYM STUFF 
I CERTAINLY DON'T NEED IT DO I 
SO WE'VE VISITED BOTH THE PROPERTIES YOU PICKED OUT 
WHICH ONE DO YOU PREFER DEFINITELY THE WHITE HOUSE DEFINITELY 
I'M QUITE SURPRISED BECAUSE I THOUGHT THIS ONE'S GOT SO MUCH CHARACTER IT'S SLIGHTLY BIGGER 
FOR ME IT'S THE ROAD IT'S SUCH A BUSY ROAD 
I DON'T FEEL AS IF I'D BE IN THE COUNTRY 
THE WHITE HOUSE DOES HAVE A LOT OF CHARACTER WHICH WE DIDN'T EXPECT BUT IN A VERY SUBTLE WAY 
IT WAS SUCH A LIGHT AND AIRY HOUSE 
IT WAS A LOT BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE 
IT'S GOT A LOT OF ROOM THE GARDEN'S A LOT BIGGER 
WHAT ABOUT THE VILLAGE IT WAS THAT VICAR OF DIBLEY TYPE VILLAGE IT HAD THE GREEN 
IT HAD SOME LOVELY PUBS 
IT JUST FELT A LOT MORE HOMELY 
SO DO YOU LIKE IT ENOUGH TO PUT IN AN OFFER YEAH YEAH DEFINITELY 
WE WERE VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE HOUSE AND THE VILLAGE WE'LL REALLY THINK ABOUT IT 
THE ASKING PRICE IS TWO HUNDRED NINETY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY BUT THE OWNER HAS INTIMATED TO ME THAT HE'S OPEN TO OFFERS RIGHT 
THAT MIGHT MAKE IT EVEN MORE ATTRACTIVE 
WELL I THINK YOU SHOULD GO FOR WOODCHURCH 
THAT'S MY FINAL WORDS ON THE SUBJECT 
O. K. GET YOUR LITTLE GIRLS MOVED OUT TO THE COUNTRY YES I THINK SO 
I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADING 
GOOD BEST OF LUCK THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
TRUE TO THEIR WORD LI AND STEVE PUT IN AN OFFER OF TWO HUNDRED NINETY TWO THOUSAND 
ON THE WOODCHURCH PROPERTY AND IT'S BEEN ACCEPTED 
NOW THEY JUST NEED TO COMPLETE THE SALE OF THEIR OWN PLACE 
AND THEY'RE GOOD TO GO
