FOR A COUPLE WHO WANT THEIR PROPERTY TO FACE EAST WHICH IS 
IT'S THIS WAY THAT WAY 
ED EAST IS EAST IT IS YES 
YEAH AND IT'S THERE HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT 
HOW DO I KNOW COME ON 
TAKE YOUR WRISTWATCH LAY IT FLAT IN YOUR HAND 
YOU POINT THE HOUR HAND TOWARDS THE SUN 
THEN YOU DISSECT THE HOUR HAND BETWEEN TWELVE AND 
GIVING YOU THE NORTH SOUTH LINE WHICH MEANS THAT'S EAST 
THAT'S NONSENSE THAT'S ABSOLUTE NONSENSE 
ED WOULD I LIE TO YOU 
YES YOU WOULD YOU JUST HAVE 
NOW EAST REALLY MUST BE EAST FOR OUR BUYERS TODAY RAJ AND JOHERTY CHOHAN 
JOHERTY FOLLOWS THE HINDU PRINCIPLES OF VASTU SHASTRA 
WHICH MAINTAINS THAT THE DIRECTION AND LAYOUT OF YOUR HOUSE 
AFFECTS YOUR WELL BEING LIKE FENG SHUI 
THE FAMILY LIVE AT DARLASTON IN THE WEST MIDLANDS AND HAVE THREE GROWN UP CHILDREN 
ONE IS MARRIED AND TWO LIVE AT HOME 
RAJ ISN'T SO BOTHERED WHERE HE MOVES AS LONG AS THERE'S A SHED FOR HIS THREE LAWNMOWERS 
JOHERTY ON THE OTHER HAND HAS GOT A LONG WISH LIST 
I'D LIKE A BIG HOUSE WITH BIG GARDEN A NICE BIG LOUNGE 
SEPARATE DINING ROOM 
NICE BIG KITCHEN UTILITY ROOM FOUR DOUBLE SIZED BEDROOMS 
MY PRAYER YOGA ROOM NICE BIG GARAGE 
SHALL I CARRY ON WHAT ELSE 
HOLD ON YOURS WAS QUITE A SMALL LIST WAS IT RAJ 
OF COURSE IT'S LIKE FOUR BEDROOMS AND A LARGE KITCHEN 
AS SHE DOES MOST OF THE COOKING AS WELL AS I DO AS WELL SO 
RIGHT I'M GOING WITH RAJ I LIKED HIS LIST 
HIS LIST WAS GREAT YOURS WAS FABULOUS HIS WAS QUICKER 
WHY ARE THE FOUR BEDROOMS IMPORTANT WELL THE CHILDREN HAVE GROWN UP 
AND WE'RE HAVING A PROBLEM WITH TWO AND A HALF BEDROOMS YOU CAN SAY RIGHT 
AND A FOUR BEDROOMED WOULD HELP WHEN MY OTHER DAUGHTER COMES HOME SO WE HAVE A SPARE ROOM TO STOP IN 
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ARE WE TALKING THIS AREA ARE WE MOVING AWAY 
ROUGHLY ABOUT FIVE TO TEN MILES RADIUS O. K. 
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU GOT TO SPEND 
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THAT'S THE MAXIMUM 
I'D IMAGINE THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS YOU'VE BEEN ALREADY 
PUTTING OUT SOME FEELERS LOOKING AT PROPERTIES 
THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT SOUNDED LIKE TEN YEARS 
NO THEY'D HAVE FOUND A HOUSE COURSE WE'RE ONLY HERE FOR A DAY 
SO IN THE LAST TEN DAYS YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A HOUSE NO TEN YEARS 
IT STILL SOUNDS LIKE YEARS DOESN'T IT YEARS YES 
JUST BRUSH OVER IT SMILE NICELY AT THEM 
SO SERIOUSLY REALLY TEN YEARS YES 
YOU MUST HAVE SEEN A LOT OF THINGS YOU DON'T LIKE OVER TEN YEARS 
WELL THERE ARE HOUSES THAT IF I LIKE 
RAJ SAYS IT'S TOO FAR OR THE GIRLS SAY NO WE DON'T LIKE THIS 
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT ONE OF US 
SO YOU THINK WHAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO IN TEN YEARS WE CAN DO IN ONE DAY 
PRAY 
OH YES OH YES IT'S POSSIBLE IT'S POSSIBLE THIS WAY COME ON 
SEE YOU LATER BYE THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR TEN YEARS FOR THIS PLACE 
RIGHT WE'VE GOT ALL THE DAYLIGHT LEFT IN TODAY TO FIND THEM A HOUSE 
YOU'RE WASTING IT BY TALKING YES I AM 
IT'S NOT THE TEN YEARS THAT WORRY ME BUT PUTTING THE HOUSE IN THE RIGHT POSITION KIND OF THING 
LOOK AT THAT NO A COMPASS NO WHICH WAY DO YOU WANT TO WALK 
I'M GOING TO GO EAST I'M GOING TO GO SOUTH 
GREAT I'LL SEE YOU LATER ON SEE YOU LATER ON 
NO IT'S THIS WAY SORRY YOU'RE THAT WAY RIGHT 
WALSALL IS AN UP AND COMING AREA WITH MUCH TO SHOUT ABOUT 
THE TOWN CENTRE IS THRIVING AND HAS A MULTI MILLION POUND ART GALLERY 
THE TOWN'S TRADITIONAL INDUSTRY IS LEATHER AND MOST PEOPLE STILL WORK IN MANUFACTURING AND RETAIL 
PROPERTY IS REASONABLE 
THE HOUSING STOCK IS MOSTLY SEMIS WHICH AVERAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
DETACHED HOUSES AVERAGE TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND SEVENTY GRAND BELOW THE NATIONAL NORM 
SO A TWO FIFTY K. BUDGET SHOULD STRETCH QUITE FAR AROUND HERE BUT WHAT WOULD IT BUY AROUND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY 
WELL HOW ABOUT THIS THREE BED TERRACE IN BRISTOL 
TASTEFULLY MODERNISED YOURS FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
OR YOU MIGHT LIKE THESE CONVERTED STABLES IN GARMOUTH SCOTLAND 
WITH FABULOUS VIEWS FOR TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
BUT FINALLY IT MIGHT BE 
THIS TWO BED APARTMENT IN NANTWICH CHESHIRE YOU'D FANCY 
PRECISELY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
RIGHT I'M BRACING MYSELF FOR A CHALLENGE OF A LIFETIME 
JOHERTY AND RAJ HAVE BEEN HOUSE HUNTING FOR OVER A DECADE 
WE HAVE A MUCH SMALLER TIME FRAME BUT FEAR NOT BECAUSE I'M ARMED WITH EDWARD'S COMPASS 
I HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S LIVED IN THEIR HOUSE FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS 
THEY'VE BEEN HOUSE HUNTING FOR TEN YEARS RIGHT IT'S TRICKY 
WE HAVE AN ESTATE AGENCY 
BUT IT'S NOT EAST FACING SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO IN IT 
THE HOUSE NEEDS TO FACE EAST YEAH HAVE YOU EVER HAD PEOPLE ASKING FOR THIS BEFORE WE HAVE INDEED 
YOU SEE THIS REALLY IS VERY DIFFICULT BUT AS THEY SAY TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE 
VASTU SHASTRA RIGHT 
THIS IS THE OVERRIDING THING 
WHERE ARE GOOD HOUSES ROUND HERE WHERE SHOULD I BE LOOKING 
BUNGALOW POSSIBILITY IN THE RIGHT PRICE RANGE 
IF YOU HAD THREE MOWERS WOULD YOU FEEL SLIGHTLY AT A LOSS TO DO WITH TWO OF THEM 
I'D SUSPECT YES UNLESS THEY'RE INTO CRICKET AND IT'S AN OUTFIELD MOWER AND A CRICKET AND WICKET MOWER ETC 
HE DOES LIKE HIS CRICKET THAT COULD BE WHY HE WANTS THREE 
HIS WIFE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND APPARENTLY HE'S GOT AN OBSESSION AND KEEPS BUYING MOWERS

JUST PERFECT THAT IS 
JOHERTY WHAT DO YOU RECKON 
I LIKE WHAT I SEE FROM THE FRONT BUT I WANT TO GO INSIDE AND HAVE A LOOK 
KRISTIAN DO YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN WHY THIS IS THE WILD CARD 
IT DOESN'T LOOK TOO SCARY OR UNCONVENTIONAL 
IT'S THE LOCATION O. K. WILLENHALL

GO IN THERE AND SEE IF WE'RE TICKING THE BOXES 
IT'S ALL YOURS ENJOY THANK YOU 
ISN'T SHE LOVELY SHE IS YOU FORGOT TO DO THE OLD EAST THING

ACTUALLY IT DOES ALMOST YEAH IF IT WAS 
IF WE JUST MOVED IT A BIT 
IT'S LOVELY THOUGH LOVELY 
OH WOW THAT'S NICE ISN'T IT 
ISN'T IT NICE 
SO WE'VE HAD A CERAMIC EGG A STRANGE MECHANICAL SEESAW 
AND A TRAMPOLINE WE'RE DOING ALL RIGHT 
IT SEEMS ONLY FITTING 
DO YOU THINK THIS IS GONNA BE THE ONE 
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL ISN'T IT YEAH NICE AND BIG 
THAT'S THE DINING AREA 
GOOD SIZE AS WELL 
IT IS BUT I WOULD HAVE LIKED SEPARATE 
OH NO IT'S NOT AS BIG AS THE OTHER TWO WE'VE SEEN 
NO BUT IT'S NICE DECENT SIZE YEAH 
IT'S JUST AN EXTENSION OF A LIVING AREA AGAIN ISN'T IT MM 
THIS CONSERVATORY ISN'T AS LARGE AS THE OTHERS BUT IN TERMS OF 
DESIGN AND THE WAY IT LOOKS THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST 
RIGHT LET'S GO AND SEE THE GARDEN SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FROM THE CONSERVATORY 
I DON'T THINK IT LOOKS VERY BIG FROM HERE 
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT 
THE COMPASS YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE ENERGY AND WHERE THE HOUSE IS SITTING IT'S GOOD 
IT'S FACING THE SAME AS OUR HOUSE IS AT PRESENT 
MORE OR LESS COS EAST IS THAT WAY 
SO IT IS A SOUTH FACING GARDEN 
SO THIS MUST BE THE KITCHEN 
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA FIND THIS KITCHEN A BIT SMALL 
SAME SIZE AS THE ONE WHAT WE'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT 
YES I'M A BIT DISAPPOINTED WITH THE KITCHEN 
COS IT IS SMALL AND I WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT MUCH BIGGER 
WELL IF THEY WANT TO EXTEND THE KITCHEN IT WILL GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO DO 
YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER ROOM THERE SO YOU CAN MAKE THAT INTO SLIGHTLY BIGGER 
WHAT'S THIS ANOTHER DINING ROOM 
YOU COULD MAKE THIS KITCHEN A LOT BIGGER 
THIS IS QUITE A BIG SIZE YES WELL THAT'S INTERESTING 
BUT THEN THAT MEANS MORE WORK FOR YOU AND YOU DON'T WANT TO DO ANY WORK DO YOU 
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD SIZE 
THIS IS YOUR UTILITY ROOM THAT'S A GOOD SIZE AS WELL 
WELL THAT'S FINE FOR THE UTILITY ROOM BUT I WOULD DEFINITELY NEED 
TO HAVE MY KITCHEN EXTENDED BECAUSE THAT'S TOO SMALL 
THIS IS ONE BEDROOM YEAH 
OH THAT'S A GOOD SIZED BEDROOM ISN'T IT 
IT'S THE QUANTITY AS WELL AS THE QUALITY 
OH THAT'S THE BOX ROOM 
THEY'VE STILL GOT A SINGLE BED IN THERE 
AND THERE'S SPACE HERE FOR THE CUPBOARDS AND THINGS 
A GOOD SIZE FOR A BOX ROOM AS WELL AT LEAST IT'S GOT A SINGLE BED IN 
RAJ IS SNIFFING THAT THE HUNT IS OVER 
HE'S TRYING TO CALL THE DOGS OFF 
IT'S A GOOD SIZED BATHROOM AS WELL 
YEAH 
HAVE THEY GOT A SHOWER IN THERE DO YOU WANT TO GO AND HAVE A LOOK 
YEAH THEY HAVE AN ELECTRIC SHOWER 
THAT'S JUST RIGHT THERE IS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
VERY NICE THAT SEEMS NICE SIZE AS WELL 
YEAH IT IS ISN'T IT AND YOU'VE GOT THE SPACE FOR UNITS AND THINGS 
THAT'S THEIR FOURTH BEDROOM ONE TWO THREE 
THAT'S THE FOURTH BEDROOM AND THERE'S ANOTHER ROOM HERE 
OH YOU CAN MAKE YOUR PRAYER ROOM IN THIS ONE 
THIS IS A TIGHT SQUEEZE ISN'T IT 
WELL YOU CAN MAKE THAT AS YOUR PRAYER ROOM 
YEAH I SUPPOSE I COULD IT DEPENDS LET'S JUST HAVE A LOOK AND SEE 
WHICH WAY WOULD I BE FACING IF I DID MY PRAYER 
I'D HAVE TO PUT MY TEMPLE FACING EAST AND THAT LOOKS SOMEWHERE LIKE 
YOU COULD PUT IT ANYWHERE THERE 
HE IS LEADING THE WAY HE IS CARRYING A BEACON OF HOUSE HUNTING LIGHT ROUND THIS PROPERTY 
WE CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THE GARDEN BECAUSE I WANT A BIG 
WE'LL HAVE A LOOK AT THE GARDEN O. K. 
THAT'S REALLY NICE 
NOW THIS HAS BEEN YOUR PROBLEM HASN'T IT IN EVERY SINGLE HOUSE THE GARDEN 
YOU'VE BEEN DESPERATE TO GET IN HERE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
THIS IS A DECENT SIZED GARDEN 
YOU'VE GOT YOUR DECKING AS WELL I LIKE THAT 
I'VE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE THAT MODERN HOUSES HAVE SMALL GARDENS 
THE WAY ROUND IT BECAUSE YOU QUITE FANCY A MODERN HOUSE IS TO HAVE RAJ 
FIND A PLOT FOR YOU AND BUILD A HOUSE ON THERE AND HAVE A GIGANTIC GARDEN 
CAN YOU SEE HIM DOING THAT 
I WANNA SAY YES 
I DOUBT IT I DOUBT IT 
RIGHT SO THE GARDEN'S GONNA BE A FACTOR BUT I THINK THIS LAID OUT IS LOVELY 
NOW YOU LIKE THE HOUSE 
THE BIG QUESTION IS MONEY 
AND WITH THOSE FOOTSTEPS IS ONE MAN 
THOSE FOOTSTEPS HAVE BEEN ALL ROUND 
I'VE JUST HAD ANOTHER LOOK I THINK IT IS A GREAT HOUSE 
SO IT IS GONNA BE HARD WHEN YOU DO GUESS THE PRICE BECAUSE IT IS A LOVELY PROPERTY IN A NICE AREA 
IT HAS GOT POTENTIAL IT'S GOT POTENTIAL 
NOW JOHERTY YOU'VE GOT BOTH RIGHT SO RAJ YOU'VE GOTTA BE CLOSEST THIS TIME 
I THINK THE PRICE I WOULD SAY ROUGHLY ABOUT 
TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE I THINK 
TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE ALL RIGHT THERE OR THEREABOUTS 
COME ON JOHERTY YOU GONNA GO HIGHER OR LOWER 
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
OH YEAH COURSE YOU WERE I WAS 
NOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO A BIT 
I'LL LET YOU WIN I'LL GO LOWER 
YOU'VE LET HIM WIN HE'S BANG ON THE NOSE OF TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE RAJ CONGRATULATIONS 
O. K. NOW THIS IS THE BIG MOMENT 
YOU'VE GOTTA GO AWAY YOU'VE GOTTA THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU'VE GOTTA LET HIM WIN SOMETHING 
MAYBE LET HIM CHOOSE HE'S WON ME THAT'S ENOUGH 
I THINK THAT'S A NICE PRIZE 
I'M GONNA LET YOU DISAPPEAR AND WE'LL SEE YOU LATER FOR A BIG ANSWER 
BYE EXCELLENT 
NO WONDER SHE KNOWS ALL THE PRICES AFTER TEN YEARS OF HOUSE HUNTING 
IT IS QUITE ABSURD ISN'T IT TRUE 
O. K. WHILST THEY GO OFF AND MAKE THE BIG ONE 
THE VERY BIG DECISION HERE IS A QUICK RECAP FOR YOU AT HOME 
FIRST UP THERE WAS MY CHOICE THE FORMER SHOW HOME NO LESS 
FIVE BEDROOMS AND LOTS OF SPACE FOR ENTERTAINING AND AN ASKING PRICE OF TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
THEN THERE WAS MY LITTLE NUMBER 
ONLY FOUR BEDS BUT WITH A GARAGE AND A BARGAIN PRICE TAG OF TWO HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
FINALLY THERE WAS THE WILD CARD OUTSIDE THEIR TARGET ZONE 
BUT A LOVELY HOUSE NONETHELESS ON FOR TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND 
SO THEY'VE DECIDED TO TEST DRIVE THE WILD CARD 
AND YOUNGEST DAUGHTER PREJA IS ROUND ALREADY TO OFFER HER OPINION 
BUT IT SEEMS SHE'S NOT KEEN ON THE KITCHEN 
IT'S QUITE SMALL ISN'T IT 
SHE MAY HAVE TURNED HER NOSE UP AT THE CULINARY POTENTIAL HERE 
BUT RAJ SEEMS MORE THAN SATISFIED WITH THE MOWING POTENTIAL OF THE BACK GARDEN 
AND JOHERTY SEEMS QUITE HAPPY TO WORK ON HER YOGA MOVES IN THAT CONSERVATORY 
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THEY'VE INVITED AN EXPERT AROUND 
WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT THE HINDU PRINCIPLES OF VASTU SHASTRA 
DOCTOR PRAVEEN KUMAR IS ASSESSING THEIR BIRTH SIGNS AND THE ORIENTATION 
OF THE HOUSE TO SEE IF IT'S SUITABLE FOR THEM 
BUT BLAST THOSE COMPASSES THE OUTLOOK ISN'T ROSY 
IT IS NORTHWEST TOWARDS THE NORTH SO IT IS NOT SUITABLE 
NOT SUITABLE FOR US 
FOR YOU O. K. 
WE'VE SEEN YOU DO YOUR TEST DRIVE IT WAS INTERESTING 
WHAT'S YOUR PERSONAL FEELING ON IT NOW JOHERTY YOU'VE HAD IT LOOKED AT 
THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK ABOUT IS IT'S GOT TOO MANY CORNERS 
IF YOU HAD SAID SOMETHING TO US ABOUT TOO MANY CORNERS WE COULD HAVE 
LOOKED FOR A TURRET AND THAT WOULD HAVE ERADICATED CORNERS I HAD A GOOD WINDMILL AROUND THE CORNER 
MISSED ALL THOSE OPPORTUNITIES 
I CAN'T SEE HIM WITH A CHISEL I CAN SEE HIM WITH A MOWER 
WE CAN ALL SEE HIM WITH A MOWER REGULARLY WITH THREE DIFFERENT ONES AND TWO STRIMMERS 
IT'S THE BIG QUESTION 
IT'S THE END OF YOUR JOURNEY AND THERE IS A NATION HOPING THAT THIS PLEASE THIS 
COULD BE THE END 
TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY AFTER TEN YEARS 
THAT IS THE PROFOUND QUESTION 
IT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE GOT POSSIBLY ANOTHER FIVE OR TEN YEARS OF HOUSE HUNTING 
NO I THINK WILL PROBABLY FIND SOMETHING WITHIN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS OR SO 
THAT'S A DESPERATE MAN 
HE'S HOPING I'M CROSSING MY FINGERS FOR YOU 
WE WILL SEE YOU SOON GOOD LUCK 
TAKE CARE 
BYE ED WHO WERE WE TRYING TO KID THEY WERE GOING TO BUY THIS HOUSE 
AFTER TEN YEARS OF HOUSE HUNTING WE WERE MAD 
WE WERE TRYING TO DO IT IN A DAY 
TEN YEARS VERSUS A DAY IT'S LIKE TRYING TO FRENCH KISS A LION 
LIKE TRYING TO STOP LORNE SPICER FROM GETTING INTO YOUR ATTIC 
IT'S LIKE TRYING TO SEE THE FUNNY SIDE OF EASTENDERS 
WE WILL BE BACK SOON 
IF YOU ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND A HOUSE THEN PLEASE 
GET IN TOUCH WE NEED TO GET TO THE STATION 
WHICH IS WHY I AM PULLING THIS OUT IT IS EAST OF HERE WHICH IS 
THIS WAY
