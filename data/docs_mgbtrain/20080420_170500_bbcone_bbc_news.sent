JOHN PRESCOTT REVEALS A TEN YEAR 
BATTLE WITH THE EATING DISORDER 
BULIMIA BULIMIA HE SAYS BINGE EATING WAS A REACTION 
TO STRESS HE HOPES OTHERS WILL NOT 
SUFFER IN SILENCE 
I NEVER ADMITTED TO THIS OUT OF 
THE SHAME AND EMBARRASSMENT L. 
FOUND IT DIFFICULT AS A MAN LIKE ME 
THAT I SUFFERED FROM BULIMIA 
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE TEN PENCE 
TAX ROW THE CHANCELLOR OF THE 
EXCHEQUER TELLS THE B. B. C. THERE WILL 
BE NO U. TURN 
WILLIAM UNDER FIRE SHOULD A 
HELICOPTER TRAINING FLIGHT HAVE 
INCLUDED A STOP AT THE MIDDLETON'S 
HOME CHAMPION OF THE WORLD 
AND VICTORY FOR CALZAGHE STILL 
UNDEFEATED AFTER AN EPIC FIGHT BACK 
IN LAS VEGAS 
GOOD EVENING IT'S A DISORDER MORE 
COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH TEENAGE 
GIRLS BUT TODAY JOHN PRESCOTT HAS 
REVEALED A TEN YEAR STRUGGLE WITH 
BULIMIA NERVOSA THE FORMER DEPUTY 
PRIME MINISTER SAYS SHAME AND 
EMBARRASSMENT PREVENTED HIM FROM 
ADMITTING TO THE EATING DISORDER 
BEFORE BUT HE SAYS HE HOPES OTHER 
PEOPLE AFFECTED WILL NOT SUFFER IN 
SILENCE OUR CORRESPONDENT DANNY 
SAVAGE HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO HIM 
BY HIS OWN ADMISSION JOHN PRESCOTT 
LOVES HIS FOOD 
AND AFTER LABOUR CAME TO POWER IN 
NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN IN HIS OWN WORDS HE STUFFED 
HIS FACE WITH ANY OLD RUBBISH BUT 
OUT OF THE PUBLIC EYE HE WAS OFTEN 
SICK AFTERWARDS A CLASSIC SYMPTOM 
OF BULIMIA HE HAS WRITTEN ABOUT 
SUFFERING FROM IT IN HIS NEW BOOK 
BUT TODAY SAID IT WAS HARD TO COME 
TO TERMS WITH THE STIGMA OF THE 
CONDITION CONDITION I NEVER ADMITTED TO THIS OUT OF THE 
SHAME AND EMBARRASSMENT 
I FOUND IT DIFFICULT AS MAN LIKE ME 
TO ADMIT THAT I SUFFERED FROM 
BULIMIA THE DOCTORS TOLD ME IT WAS 
PROBABLY DUE TO STRESS HOW HOW DIFFICULT WAS IT TO GO AND SEEK 
TREATMENT 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO ADMIT TREATMENT IT AND GO WHEN YOU ARE A PUBLIC 
OFFICIAL HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WILL 
STAY SECRET YOU NEED TO TAKE 
MEDICAL ADVICE YOU HAVE TO GET 
OVER THAT THAT'S WHY I WANT TO SAY 
TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DO TAKE 
ADVICE IT CAN HELP IT CAN HELP 
YOU OUT OF A LOT OF MISERY IF YOU 
SUFFER IN SILENCE 
THE FORMER DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER 
HAS ALWAYS ADMITTED TODAY THAT THIS 
IS HIS FAVOURITE RESTAURANT IN THE 
WORLD CHINESE RESTAURANT IN HULL 
THE MENU IS SEVERAL PAGES LONG AND 
HAS NINETY THREE DISHES ON IT BUT STAFF HERE 
SAY JOHN PRESCOTT IS USUALLY 
SATISFIED WITH ONE OF THE SET 
BANQUETS BANQUETS MR. PRESCOTT'S ADMISSION IS LIKELY 
TO HIGHLIGHT THE PLIT OF ELEVEN 
MILLION PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM 
EATING DISORDERS IN THE U. K. THE 
MAJORITY ARE WOMEN BUT ONE IN TEN 
MEN ARE AFFECTED 
BULIMIA IS THE MOST COMMON EATING 
DISORDER DISORDER THE AVERAGE AGE OF A SUFFERER IS 
BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE 
IT'S EXTREMELY UNUSUAL IN MY 
EXPERIENCE FOR A MAN OF THIS AGE TO 
PRESENT WITH THIS PROBLEM AND IT 
DOES MAKE ME WONDER WHETHER THERE 
IS A SILENT NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT 
THERE THAT ARE NOT SEEKING THE 
APPROPRIATE HELP 
JOHN PRESCOTT ADMITS THAT SOME 
PEOPLE COULD ACCUSE HIM OF NOT 
BEING VERY SUCCESSFUL BULIMIC 
BECAUSE HIS WEIGHT DIDN'T DROP HIS 
MOTIVATION NOW THOUGH IS TO TRY AND 
REMOVE THE STIGMA OF EATING 
DISORDERS DISORDERS THERE WILL BE NO CLIMB DOWN OVER 
THE GOVERNMENT'S ABOLITION OF THE 
TEN PENCE TAX RATES THAT WAS THE 
CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER'S 
MESSAGE TODAY ALISTAIR DARLING 
SAID IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO UNRAVEL 
HIS BUDGET DESPITE A DAMAGING ROW 
WITH LABOUR REBELS TODAY ONE 
LABOUR M. P. INSISTED THAT THE PRIME 
MINISTER WAS IN DENIAL OVER THE 
ISSUE JAMES HARDY REPORTS 
IT WAS HIS LAST ACT AS CHANCELLOR 
OF THE EXCHEQUER BUT IT'S FROM 
BEHIND THE DOOR OF NUMBER TEN THAT 
GORDON BROWN'S COUNTING THE COST OF 
HIS DECISION TO SCRAP THE TEN PENCE 
TAX RATE NOW IT'S HIS SUCCESSOR 
WHO IS HAVING TO PICK UP THE PIECES 
HIS MESSAGE TO LABOUR M. P.'S TODAY 
YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE IT BUT THERE CAN 
BE NO QUICK FIXES 
I INTEND AS I 
SAY IN FUTURE BUDGETS TO DO MORE 
WHAT I CAN'T DO IS TO REWRITE THE 
BUDGET THE FINANCIAL YEAR HAS 
ALREADY BEGUN THERE ARE MILLIONS 
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY GOING TO 
BE PAYING TAX AT TWENTY PENCE RATHER 
THAN AT TWENTY TWO PENCE 
BUT LEAVING CHANGES TO FUTURE 
BUDGETS WON'T BUY OFF A LOOMING 
COMMONS REBELLION OR SATISFY PEOPLE 
LIKE THIS BEAUTICIAN WHO WILL LOSE 
OUT AND ARE NOT IMPRESSED BY TAX 
CREDITS 
A LOT OF TIME WHEN THEY CREDITS SAY YOU CAN APPLY FOR THIS OR NOT 
THEY SAY YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR 
IT WHAT IS THE POINT IN TRYING 
LABOUR M. P.'S ARE BOMBARDING THE 
TREASURY WITH COMPLAINTS BECAUSE 
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT SCRAPPING THE 
TEN PENCE RATE COULD HIT FIFTY THREE 
MILLION HOUSEHOLDS MOST VULNERABLE 
WOULD BE PEOPLE WHO EARNED LESS 
THAN NINETEEN THOUSAND YEAR HAVE NO 
CHILDREN AND ARE UNDER TWENTY FIVE OF THEM 
THE WORST AFFECTED COULD LOSE MORE 
THAN TWO HUNDRED THIRTY A YEAR 
AS LABOUR M. P.'S SQUABBLE AMONGST 
THEMSELVES THE OPPOSITION PARTIES 
ARE RUBBING THEIR NOSES IN IT 
WE SHOULD REOPEN THE PACKAGE THAT 
WAS PRESENTED AT LAST YEAR'S BUDGET 
WHICH WE COMPLAINED ABOUT AS A TAX 
CON AND LOOK AT HOW WE CAN HELP THE 
FIVE POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES 
WHO ARE GOING TO SEE THEIR TAX GOES 
UP 
WHAT THE LABOUR BACKBENCHERS UP SEE IS THE WAY THIS IS BEING 
FINANCED IS BY TAKING IT AWAY FROM 
PEOPLE RIGHT AT THE VERY BOTTOM 
THERE ARE CERTAINLY CERTAIN GROUPS 
OF PEOPLE PARTICULARLY SINGLE 
YOUNGER WORKERS WHO DON'T HAVE 
ACCESS TO THE TAX CREDIT SYSTEM 
WHO WILL BE WORSE OFF 
THE ROW 
LOOKS TO HAVE OPENED TENSIONS 
BETWEEN MR. DARLING AND MR. BROWN 
WITH THE CHANCELLOR AT LEAST SEEING 
TO BE IN CLOSEST TOUCH WITH PUBLIC 
CONCERNS CONCERNS POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING WHETHER A 
MAN WHO DIED AT A HOTEL IN CORNWALL 
SUFFERED CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING 
THE BODY OF A MAN IN HIS FIFTIES 
WAS DISCOVERED AT THE GREAT WESTERN 
HOTEL IN NEWQUAY ANOTHER FIVE 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO HOSPITAL 
SUFFERING FROM SYMPTOMS OF CARBON 
MONOXIDE POISONING 
IT'S EMERGED THAT PRINCE WILLIAM 
LANDED AN R. A. F. HELICOPTER IN A FIELD 
AT THE FAMILY HOME OF HIS 
GIRLFRIEND KATE MIDDLETON THE 
BRIEF STOP HAPPENED DURING A 
TRAINING FLIGHT BUT IT COMES JUST 
DAYS AFTER CONFIRMATION THAT THE 
PRINCE HAD USED A CHINOOK TO FLY 
WITH HIS BROTHER HARRY TO A STAG 
PARTY AS NAVDIP DHARIWAL REPORTS 
THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE HAS 
DEFENDED BOTH FLIGHTS 
WILLIAM WAS AWARDED HIS R. A. F. WINGS

AT R. A. F. ODIUM TO A FIELD BELONGING 
TO HIS GIRLFRIEND KATE MIDDLETON'S 
PARENTS IN BERKSHIRE THE CHINOOK 
HELICOPTER LANDED FOR TWENTY SECONDS 
NOBODY GOT ON AND NOBODY GOT OFF 
THE PRINCE FLEW BACK AGAIN IT'S 
THE TRIP THAT WILLIAM TOOK 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER GRADUATING THAT 
HAS CAUSED THE MOST CONTROVERSY 
THE PRINCE FLEW A CHINOOK 
HELICOPTER FROM R. A. F. CRANWELL TO 
LONDON TO PICK UP HIS BROTHER 
HARRY HE THEN FLEW ON TO THE ISLE 
OF WIGHT OFFICIALS SAY THIS WAS TO 
MAKE A WATER CROSSING AND APPROACH 
TO A CIVILIAN AIRFIELD 
THIS PICTURE TAKEN ON THE ISLAND 
SHOWS WILLIAM WENT ON TO JOIN HIS 
COUSIN PETER PHILLIPS TO 
CELEBRATE A STAG WEEKEND 
IT'S A WASTE OF SCARCE TRAINING 
HOURS ON THE CHINOOK YOU KNOW THE 
MONEY SPENT ON THAT SORTIE MIGHT 
PERHAPS HAVE BEEN SPENT ON TRAINING 
A GUY WHO IS ACTUALLY GOING TO FLY 
A CHINOOK AS HIS CAREER RATHER 
THAN SOMEONE WHO IS MERELY GOING TO 
BE THE C. AND C. OF THE R. A. F. THE THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE SAYS THE 
PRINCE'S TRAIN WAS DESIGNED TO GIVE 
HIM AN INSIGHT INTO THE MANY ROLES 
OF THE ROYAL AIR FORCE 
SCOTLAND'S FIRST MINISTER ALEX 
SALMOND HAS ADDRESSED HIS PARTY AT 
THE SPRING CONFERENCE IN EDINBURGH

THAT SUPPORT FOR AN INDEPENDENT 
SCOTLAND WOULD INCREASE AFTER ITS 
RECORD IN ITS FIRST YEAR IN 
GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT SOME SAY THAT GOOD GOVERNMENT FROM 
THE S. N. P. WILL MEAN THAT SCOTS ARE 
SATISFIED TO BE IN THE UNION SAY 
THAT GOOD GOVERNMENT FROM THE S. N. P.

TAKEN PART IN A MAJOR OPERATION TO 
SMASH AN INTERNET PROSTITUTION RING

INDUSTRY THE REWARDS ARE MASSIVE 
PIMPS CAN EARN AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND A 
WEEK PREYING ON WOMEN WHO THEY'VE 
TURNED INTO MODERN DAY SLAVES SO 
WHAT HAVE THE POLICE BEEN DOING TO

CULMINATION OF A FOUR MONTH COVERT 
INQUIRY IT'S ALLEGED THAT 
CRIMINALS CONTROL THE WOMEN THROUGH 
AN ESCORT AGENCY WEBSITE A NEW 
PHENOMENON CLIENTS BOOK WHAT THEY 
WANT FROM A MENU OF SERVICES ONLINE

EVER STRIKE AGAINST BROTHELS 
OPERATING ON THE INTERNET 
THE POLICE SAY THIS NETWORK IS 
BELIEVED TO HAVE SOLD ON THE WOMEN 
TO OTHER PIMPS THE THREATS MEAN 
THAT THE VICTIMS HAVE NO CONTROL 
OVER THEIR LIVES 
IT CAN RANGE FROM 
QUITE SIMPLE USE OF FORCE THROUGH 
TO A MORE IMPLYED THREAT OF PERHAPS 
A THREAT TO FAMILY BACK HOME IN 
THEIR HOME COUNTRY A THREAT TO 
FRIENDS OR IT MIGHT BE SOME SORT OF 
DEBT BONDAGE WHERE THE WOMEN ARE 
FINANCIALLY TIED TO THE MEN 
INVOLVED IN THE ACTIVITY THE THE POLICE RAIDED TWENTY SIX PROPERTIES IN 
PLACES LIKE THIS ACROSS CENTRAL 
LONDON ON SUSPICION THEY WERE BEING 
RUN AS BROTHELS THEY SAY THAT
