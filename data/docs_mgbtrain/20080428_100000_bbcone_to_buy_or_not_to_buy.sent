WELCOME TO TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY TODAY WE HELP A COUPLE RESTORE THEIR WORK LIFE BALANCE 
THEY WANT MORE STABLE TIME TOGETHER IN THE GLORIOUS COUNTRYSIDE OF WARWICKSHIRE 
IMAGINE SPENDING FOUR HOURS EVERY DAY TRAVELLING TO AND FROM WORK 
AND WITH HARDLY ANY TIME TO ENJOY AT HOME YOU'D BE WANTING A CHANGE 
TODAY'S COUPLE ARE LOOKING TO US TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM 
WE WILL FIND THEM A SELECTION OF THREE SUPERB PROPERTIES 
SO THEY CAN TRY BEFORE THEY BUY 
CLAIRE AND PAUL HORTON LIVE IN THIS FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE WITH SEVEN ACRES IN MALVERN WORCESTERSHIRE 
BUT CLAIRE'S JOB AS GENERAL MANAGER OF WARWICK UNIVERSITY STUDENT UNION 
MEANS SHE HAS TO LEAVE THE HOUSE AT SIX FORTY FIVE A M. TO DRIVE TWO HOURS TO WORK 
THEY ARE BOTH PASSIONATE ABOUT HORSES BUT FIND THERE ISN'T ENOUGH TIME TO ENJOY THEM 
SO THEY'LL SELL THEIR GRAND HOME AND MOVE NEARER TO CLAIRE'S WORK 
SO IS THIS THE RIGHT THING TO DO 
PAUL CLAIRE HERE WE ARE QUINTESSENTIAL ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE 
ROLLING HILLS BEAUTIFUL VIEWS FROM YOUR HOUSE SO YOU'RE MOVING 
IT'S MY FAULT I HAVE TO WORK UNFORTUNATELY I WORK SIXTY MILES AWAY 
IT'S TAKING ME FOUR HOURS EVERY DAY TO COMMUTE THERE AND BACK 
I'M NEVER AT HOME SO I REALLY NEED TO GET A BIT CLOSER TO WHERE I WORK 
FIGURE THAT SO LET ME JUST CLARIFY WHERE ARE WE LOOKING 
WE'RE LOOKING IN A RADIUS OF ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY MINUTES OF WARWICK O. K. 
YOU'VE GOT SOME PETS TWO HORSES FIVE SHEEP TWO DOGS 
TWO CATS A HUSBAND AND A SON 
IT'S A MENAGERIE OF STRANGE CREATURES 
SO GETTING THIS SOMEWHERE ELSE COULD BE QUITE TRICKY 
WHAT ARE WE ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEWHERE WITH LAND SO SOMETHING FOR THE HORSES 
AND PROPERTY THAT'S TRADITIONAL IT'S GOT TO HAVE SOME CHARACTER 
O. K. AND IT'S GOT TO HAVE WHAT ELSE THREE BEDROOMS AT LEAST 
MINIMUM THREE OBVIOUSLY WE'VE GOT FOUR HERE BUT THREE WOULD BE O. K. 
TALKING OF HORSES PAUL ONE STEPPED ON YOUR FOOT DIDN'T IT 
IT DID AND DID SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE IT DID 
YOU'VE GOT A FOOT PROBLEM DOES THAT AFFECT THE HOUSE 
THE KIND OF SPACE HOW MUCH GROUND AND MAINTENANCE 
YEAH THAT WOULD BE A BIG ISSUE 
SO AGAIN SOMETHING WITH A VERY SMALL LAWNED SLABBED AREA 
AND AGAIN A LIMITED SORT OF ACRE PROBABLY TWO ACRE MAINLY SORT OF PASTURE REALLY FOR THE HORSES 
HOW MUCH IS YOUR BUDGET HOW MUCH ARE WE SPENDING HERE WE'RE TALKING FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY 
BUT THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MY PARENTS IF THE PROPERTY IS SUITABLE TO JOIN US 
IF THERE'S AN ANNEXE A SEPARATE SOMETHING SHED ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
WE COULD GO UP TO FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY SO WE'VE GOT A BIT MORE IN THE BUDGET IF THE RIGHT PROPERTY COMES ALONG 
FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY IF WE CAN BRING THE PARENTS HORSES CATS DOGS SHEEP HUSBAND AND SON SEE YOU LATER ON 
SEE YOU LATER BYE BYE THANK YOU 
WHEN YOU'VE GOT IT SO BLATANTLY GOOD WHY NOT CHANGE YOUR JOB INSTEAD OF CHANGE YOUR HOUSE 
BECAUSE OURS IS NOT TO WONDER WHY OURS IS JUST TO TRY AND BUY 
IT'S THE FINDING THAT MAKES ME SO ANXIOUS THINK OF THE BUDGET 
YEAH WE'VE GOT OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO SPEND

OR THIS FOUR BED FARMHOUSE IN CORNWALL IT'S GOT A LARGE KITCHEN 
OUTBUILDINGS AND A MASSIVE TEN ACRES ALL FOR FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

ALL THE STUFF THEY WANTED THE BEAMS FIREPLACES VIEWS 
LOOK AT THE MANTEL THIS IS GREAT PLENTY OF ROOM MULTI FUEL 
SHE KNOWS ALL THE LINGO INDEED 
FOUR WINDOWS IN HERE 
WHEN YOU HAVE TWO WINDOWS IT'S DUAL ASPECT PLENTY OF LIGHT 
WHEN YOU'VE GOT FOUR WHAT DO YOU CALL IT QUADRALASTIC 
THAT'S HOLDING UP MY BOXER SHORTS 
YEAH IT'S QUITE NICE 
THAT'S NOT A MAN FULL OF PASSION NO IT'S NOT 
MY TILES YOUR TILES 
I JUST LOVE THESE TILES 
SOUNDS LIKE THE SAME TILES SHE HAS AT HOME 
AGA YEAH 
VIEWS OVER THERE BUT WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN HERE 
THIS WOULD BE IDEAL EXACTLY THE RIGHT SIZE FOR YOUR TABLE 
YOU SEE TICKING BOXES CONSERVATORY 
ANOTHER SORT OF ROOM TO RETIRE TO 
THIS IS ODD WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS HAVE A LOOK 
SHALL WE LOOK DARE WE LOOK 
OH GOSH GOOD IDEA WASHING MACHINE SPIN DRIER 
THEIR BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE THEY'RE WORKING UP INTO A LATHER NOW YES 
NICE LANDING PAUL IT'S GORGEOUS ISN'T IT 
PAUL'S DOING AN OLYMPIC JOB ON HIS CRUTCHES HE IS 
A HA FIRST ROOM IS OH VANITY UNIT 
IT'S GOT THE IT DOES WHAT IT IT'S GOT STORAGE THERE TOO 
YES THERE'S ENOUGH SPACE IN THERE TO DO WHAT'S NEEDED IDEAL FOR SORT OF A GUEST ROOM 
HOW LONG BEFORE THEY SPOT THIS HOUSE WAS A B. AND AMP B. 
YOU'LL BE HAPPY I'M HAPPY 
YES NICE SUNKEN BATH THERE AND A SHOWER 
HOW DO YOU SINK A BATH PULL THE PLUG OUT 
OH THIS IS QUITE THIS IS NICE 
SMALLISH BUT IT IS QUITE SMALL ISN'T IT BUT PRETTY GOOD 
I DON'T KNOW IF OUR BED'S GONNA FIT IN HERE IT'S HUGE 
SMALL LITTLE NEAT AND TIDY 
SHOWER YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME THERE IS A SHOWER IN HERE THAT'S FINE 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT YOU'D LOSE YOUR BATH BUT THERE'S ANOTHER ONE I CAN USE THAT'S FINE 
A LITTLE SMALL ISN'T IT IT IS IT'S BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED AGAIN 
WELL CLAIRE SEEMS COMPLETELY IN LOVE WITH THE DECOR 
UPSTAIRS ISN'T AS IMPRESSIVE AS DOWNSTAIRS OH MY 
YOUR UPSTAIRS ISN'T AS GOOD AS YOUR DOWNSTAIRS EVER HEARD THAT ONE NO HAVE YOU 
THIRD BEDROOM 
AND WE SPOKE EARLIER THE COMPUTER ABOUT AN OFFICE 
THIS IS YOUR OFFICE SPACE YEAH 
CERTAINLY OTHER THAN A LITTLE BIT OF DECOR TO CHANGE 
YOU COULD JUST WALK STRAIGHT IN THERE'S BARELY ANYTHING TO DO 
SIMON THAT SOUNDED CONVINCING BUT I THINK WE SHOULD DOUBLE CHECK I THINK THEY'RE IN THE KITCHEN 
PAUL I HOPE YOU AGREE IT'S A LOVELY PLACE IT IS IT IS 
BUT WHAT IT DOESN'T HAVE QUITE OBVIOUSLY ARE THE SEVEN ACRES YES 
BUT YOU DID SAY YOU WANTED SOMETHING MORE MANAGEABLE 
IT DOES HAVE QUITE A LOT OF SPACE OUT BACK HERE IT HAS 
IT WOULDN'T BE TOO HARD TO KEEP ON TOP OF 
I WANT TO APOLOGISE FOR THE LAWN 
THEY'VE JUST HAD A NEW SEPTIC TANK INSTALLED SO THAT'S A JOB DONE 
FOR AN ANIMAL LOVER YOU DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE MUCH ABOUT YOUR HORSES WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING AT THE HOUSE 
I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO TELL ME THERE WERE ACRES OF LAND HIDDEN SOMEWHERE 
ACRES MEANING MORE THAN ONE UM ER NERVOUS GRUMBLES FROM ME 
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO LAND HERE FOR THE HORSES 
WHAT WE DO HAVE ARE THE OUTHOUSES 
YEAH WITH A BIT OF WORK YOU SAID YOU WERE HANDY I'VE SEEN THE FURNITURE YOU'VE MADE 
YOU CAN CONVERT THESE INTO STABLES WHICH IS ONE OF THE BIG EXPENSES WITH KEEPING HORSES INDEED 
SO THERE ARE POSSIBILITIES 
TO YOUR RIGHT YOU HAVE A LIVERY 
SO THAT COULD BE UP FOR RENT AND IT'S USUALLY QUITE AFFORDABLE 
WITH A LAWN THIS SIZE THERE'S ALWAYS A LITTLE KICK ABOUT 
GIVE SOME OF IT TO THE SHEEP 
SAVE ON THE OLD LAWN MOWER AN ENVIRONMENTALLY BENIGN WAY TO CUT YOUR LAWN 
WHAT'S THE PHRASE WHERE YOU TRAIN THE HORSES A MENAGE 
IF YOU PUT THREE HORSES IN THERE THAT FALL IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER YOU GET A MENAGE A TROIS COME ON 
O. K. GUESS THE PRICE EVERY TIME WE SHOW A PROPERTY WE WANT YOU TO INDEPENDENTLY GUESS THE VALUE 
TO SEE WHO'S WEARING THE PANTS OF POWER WHO'S GOING FIRST HE IS 
LADIES FIRST LADIES FIRST GO ON YOU CAN DO THIS O. K. 
ARE YOU PRAYING HERE I'M HOPING I DON'T GO TOO FAR OUT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY 
RIGHT O. K. 
PAUL I'D GO FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
YOU'RE JUST HEDGING YOUR BETS 
THE ACTUAL PRICE OF THIS PROPERTY IS YOU WEREN'T TOO FAR OUT FOUR HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND ON THE MARKET 
SO A BARGAIN STILL YOU LOST TO BE BLUNT ABOUT IT YOU LOST 
I WAS HAPPY WITH THE FOUR HUNDRED TEN RATHER THAN FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY 
THE BIGGEST LOSER HERE WILL BE SIMON AFTER YOU'VE SEEN MY CHOICE PROPERTY TWO WE SHALL SEE 
THERE ARE ENOUGH RECEPTION ROOMS IN PROPERTY ONE FOR CLAIRE AND PAUL TO THINK ABOUT MUM AND DAD MOVING IN 
AND THERE WILL BE OODLES OF CASH TO MEET THE COST OF CONVERSION 
THEY NEED TO CHECK THEY CAN CONVERT THE OUTBUILDINGS TO KEEP HORSES 
IT WOULD CUT DOWN ON LIVERY COSTS 
THE SECOND PROPERTY IS MY CHOICE AND WHAT A PROPERTY 
THIS BARN CONVERSION BOASTS TOP SPECIFICATION AND BESPOKE FIXTURES AND FITTINGS 
IT'S GOT FOUR BEDROOMS AND IT COMES WITH A TWO AND A HALF ACRE PADDOCK 
WITH VIEWS ACROSS OPEN COUNTRY 
PROPERTY NUMBER TWO IS MY CHOICE 
IT'S A BIT OF A TOUGHIE BECAUSE SIMON'S PROPERTY WAS A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW 
IT WAS SO NOT WANTING TO BE UPSTAGED BY HIM EVER 
I AM OFFERING YOU THIS RATHER GORGEOUS TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD BARN CONVERSION 
EXCELLENT I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED YET I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA SAY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
YES PRICE AND AGE 
AND ALL OVER HERE IS YOUR TWO AND A HALF ACRES OF LAND 
SO YOU HAVE THE LAND THE PROPERTY IT HAS THE INTERIOR YOU WANTED 
ALL I NEED NOW IS YOUR POSITIVE COMMENTS FANTASTIC 
GREAT WE HAD THE PICTURE POSTCARD COTTAGEY FEEL 
NOW WE'VE GONE BACK TO A TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD FEATURE BUILDING WITH BEAMS AND CHARACTER 
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'LL GET IT'S A BEAUTIFUL BARN CONVERSION 
I DON'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT YOU BEFORE YOU EVEN GET IN THERE BUT IT IS ONLY THREE BEDROOM 
PARDON IT'S ONLY THREE BEDROOM 
DO YOU THINK THERE MIGHT BE FOUR POSSIBLY IN THE END WING THAT YOU OVERLOOKED 
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM HE'S JUST TRYING TO PLAY SABOTAGE 
THE WORD WING SOUNDS VERY NICE YOU'LL LOVE THIS HOUSE THEN 
BEFORE HE GETS MORE NASTY GO IN AND HAVE A LOOK ROUND GO FOR IT 
THREE BEDROOMS YOU DIDN'T COUNT IT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AN OFFICE AS WELL THINK THINK 
THEY WON'T LIKE IT WHY'S THAT IT'S NOT TRADITIONAL ENOUGH 
TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD AND NOT TRADITIONAL ENOUGH WE'LL SEE 
SHALL WE YEAH YEAH AFTER YOU WOW A HA 
ONLY POSITIVE NOISES SIMON IT'S ALL GOING WELL 
THEY'RE NOT SAYING MUCH YEAH THEY'RE SPEECHLESS 
THIS IS THE SORT OF THING I LIKE BEAMS AND NOT YOUR TILES BUT AGAIN THE RANGE 
PLENTY OF ROOM KITCHEN SLASH DINER FANTASTIC ROOM FOR YOUR TABLE 
HIGH CEILINGS PLENTY OF SPACE I LOVE THAT 
THAT ROOM IS A SHOW STOPPER YOU SEE THE BEAMS AND THE LIGHT IT'S GORGEOUS 
DOORS TO A PATIO LOOKING OVER THE FIELDS 
FOR THE HORSES PEACEFULLY GRAZING 
IF EVER A VIEW WAS A FEAST YOU'D DINE OUT ON THE VIEW FROM THOSE WINDOWS 
THIS MUST BE THE WING 
THIS IS THE WING THE GRAND WING 
THIS COULD BE ANYTHING THIS COULD BE THAT FOURTH BEDROOM OR IT COULD BE AN OFFICE YEAH 
YEAH SELF CONTAINED THIS IS GREAT ALL YOUR BITS AND PIECES 
AND ALSO IT COULD DOUBLE UP AS THAT FOURTH BEDROOM IF NEED BE IT'S REALLY NICE 
THEY KNOW IT'S THE FOURTH BEDROOM EVEN IF YOU DON'T LET'S SEE IF THEY CAN FIND AN OFFICE 
IS THIS THE MAIN LOUNGE OR JUST A SITTING ROOM I DON'T KNOW IT FEELS LIKE I DON'T KNOW 
THEY'RE IN THE FIRST SITTING AREA 
WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IT THE MORNING ROOM THE PARLOUR 
THERE'S NO NEED TO MOURN IN THERE WE LOVE IT THE PARLOUR 
OR IT COULD BE THE DINING ROOM BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR MAIN LOUNGE 
THIS IS NICE THIS IS BETTER 
THAT WOULD BE TOO FAR AWAY FOR A DINING ROOM NO LISTEN CAREFULLY CONCENTRATE WOW YOU BITE SIMON 
YEAH THIS IS WHAT FEELS RIGHT NOW THAT MAKES GOOD SENSE NOW 
AN AWFUL LOT MORE SENSE PATIO DOORS OUT ON TO THERE VERY NICE 
NICE FIREPLACE BIG WINDOWS 
AGAIN NOT A BIG ROOM BUT NICE AND COMPACT 
THEY SUGGESTED THE FIRST SITTING ROOM COULD BE A DINING ROOM 
IF I COULD SEE THROUGH THE WALL I WOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD LISTEN TO WHAT'S SAID HE'S SO UNFORGIVING 
ALREADY YOU'RE GETTING A MUCH BETTER VIEW OF THE FIELDS 
I THINK THEY LIKE THIS HOUSE A LOT SO DO I 
YEAH NEARLY AS MUCH AS PROPERTY ONE NO THEY REALLY LIKE THIS 
OH 
WELL I'M HAPPY 
YOU CAN MOVE AROUND IN HERE THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF SPACE 
IT'S QUITE A SUBSTANTIAL ROOM 
IT'S O. K. AND IT'S GOT A BATH 
GLASS OF WINE CANDLE THAT'S IT NO SHOWER FOR YOU 
HE NEVER TOLD US THAT HE REQUIRED A SHOWER NO HE CAN HAVE A BATH AND LUMP IT 
LOOK AT THOSE LIGHTS DO THE LIGHTS COME WITH THE HOUSE FANTASTIC 
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL THAT'S SWEET LOOK AT THAT 
OH MY GOODNESS LOOK UP THERE 
IS THAT A BIT SCARY IT COULD BE 
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT 
NOT A BAD SIZE ACTUALLY NICE ROOM ISN'T IT NOT A BAD SIZE 
SIMON YOU HAVE BEEN DEFEATED THEY LOVE THIS PROPERTY I JUST WANT TO TAKE A PICTURE 
THIS IS QUITE SMALL ACTUALLY YOU'D GET A SINGLE IN HERE 
YOU COULD HAVE YOUR OFFICE HERE YEAH IT'S SMALL ENOUGH 
AND THEN HAVE THAT ROOM DOWNSTAIRS AS YOUR GUEST SUITE 
H. M. M. 
THAT TRULY IS THE FACE OF DEFEAT ISN'T IT NO IT'S NOT 
AGAIN IT'S GOT THAT NICE SORT OF HEIGHT TO IT A GREAT BIG BED 
OUR BED WOULD FIT IN HERE IT'S THIS SIZE 
THIS IS NICE 
THERE'S PLENTY OF SCOPE TO DO ALL SORTS OF FABULOUS DECORATIVE THINGS IN HERE AND HERE'S YOUR SHOWER 
THEY'RE HAVING A GOOD FERRET ROUND THEY ARE 
NOW I NEED TO LOOK THROUGH THAT WINDOW FROM THE AREA OF THE BED 
SO I CAN SEE WHEN YOU'RE GIVING ME BREAKFAST IN BED 
I CAN BE LOOKING OUT TWO GRAZING HORSES AND THIS IS THE VIEW I GET 
YOU SEE NOW THAT'S THE ONE ISN'T IT IT IS 
THAT'S REALLY NICE 
SORRY KRISTIAN I THINK THEY HATED THIS PLACE YEAH DENIAL IT'S A VERY PITIFUL THING 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE BEAUTIFUL OLD BEAMS AS FEATURES IN HERE 
I THINK THEY'RE WONDERFUL GLORIOUS 
BUT DOES THIS NOT WORRY YOU RIDDLED WITH WOODWORM 
NO I THINK IT'S CHARACTER IT'S LIVED IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS IT'S USED 
THEY'RE ALSO STOPPING THE ROOF FROM SPLITTING IN TWO INDEED 
I'M GLAD YOU SAID THAT BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT WOODWORM 
AND IT RARELY DOES SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE 
IT ONLY OPERATES A MILLIMETRE OR TWO UNDER THE SURFACE 
IT BURROWS ALONG AND ALL YOU SEE ARE THE EXIT HOLES 
THIS BEAM WILL QUITE HAPPILY TAKE MY WEIGHT YOU TRUST ME DON'T YOU 
NOT REALLY 
I'LL JUST STAND OUT THE WAY 
THERE YOU GO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG 
SHALL WE JOIN THE OTHERS BEFORE THIS LOT COMES DOWN AFTER YOU 
WHAT IS REALLY INTERESTING IS THE CURRENT OWNERS WERE THINKING ABOUT HAVING A MENAGE 
AND SOME STABLES IT WOULD GO PERFECTLY IN THERE 
THEY DIDN'T GO THROUGH WITH IT BUT YOU WOULD NEED PLANNING PERMISSION 
THEY CAN SEE NO REASON WHY THAT WOULD BE REFUSED SO THAT'S A GOER 
IT'S ALL GREEN BELT LAND SO THERE'S NO PYLONS 
IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL COUNTRYSIDE 
BUT WE ARE STILL GOOD IN TERMS OF COMMUTING TO YOUR WORK 
IN FACT NOW THE COMMUTE WOULD ONLY TAKE THIRTY MINUTES 
WE'RE DOING THE HUMAN COMPUTER THING THAT MEANS YOU WOULD BE SAVING TWENTY DAYS A YEAR 
WHERE IS HE I CAN'T KISS HIM NOW 
OH WE'VE DONE THE KISSING THING ONCE OR TWICE 
TWENTY DAYS IS FANTASTIC IT'S A GOOD SAVING 
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY FOR THAT KIND OF SAVING FOR ALL THIS LAND FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF HERITAGE 
AND TO BE ABLE TO KISS HIM NOW HE'S ARRIVED 
TWENTY DAYS ARE WE DOING THIS AT EVERY HOUSE LEAVE EACH OTHER ALONE 
IT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE IT'S GUESS THE PRICE YOUR FAVOURITE BIT 
CLAIRE YOU'RE ONE NIL DOWN WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST OR SECOND 
I'LL GO SECOND PLEASE PAUL 
I WOULD SAY THIS WOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FIVE O. K. 
I WAS GONNA GO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FORTY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FORTY YEAH 
YOU'RE SO WRONG I'M EMBARRASSED ON YOUR BEHALF I'LL GIVE YOU A CLUE 
YOU WOULD BE MOVING IN WITH YOUR PARENTS 
FIFTY QUID SHORT OF FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
O. K. PROPERTY ONE LOOKS SO NICE AGAIN COMPARE IT WITH SIMON'S 
YOU'VE GOT FAR MORE LAND HERE IT'S DETACHED 
YOU'RE CLOSER TO WORK YOU'RE IN GREEN BELT I'LL DEFEND THAT PRICE 
BEAR IT IN MIND WHILE WE GO AND LOOK AT OUR WILD CARD LET'S GO 
IF THEY GO FOR PROPERTY TWO THEY WILL NEED TO CONSIDER SOME THINGS 
THIS PROPERTY SHARES A DRIVE WITH TWO OTHER HOUSES 
SO THEY'LL NEED TO CHECK HOW MUCH PARKING SPACE IS WITH THE PROPERTY 
THERE ARE UNSPOILT VIEWS AS IT'S GREEN BELT LAND AND THAT SHOULDN'T CHANGE 
CHECK WITH THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT THAT THERE ARE NO BUILDING PLANS 
THE NEXT PROPERTY CHARMED KRISTIAN AND MYSELF IT HAS THREE BEDROOMS AND A COSY LOUNGE 
AND IT'S GOT ACRES OF LAND AND A STUNNING LANDSCAPE GARDEN 
FOR OUR WILD CARD CHOICE WE'VE GONE COMPLETELY OUT THERE 
IN PROPERTY ONE I REALLY DID NEGLECT YOUR MENAGERIE 
KRISTIAN WENT SOME OF THE WAY TO REDRESS THAT WITH PROPERTY TWO 
BUT FOR THIS PROPERTY WE'VE GIVEN EVERYTHING OVER TO YOUR LOVELY ANIMALS 
IT'S CALLED HORSE SHOE COTTAGE FOR GOOD REASON WHAT DO YOU THINK 
YEAH IT'S SMALL A HINT OF THE BLACK AND WHITE 
AGAIN THE STUFF AROUND THE COTTAGE AND THE WINDOWS DOORS 
BUT IT'S GOT POTENTIAL YEAH IT MAY HAVE WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE A LOOK SEE WHAT HAPPENS AROUND THE BACK 
YOU WANTED CHARM AND CHARACTER 
THAT IS IN THAT COTTAGE LYING DORMANT IT NEEDS REDISCOVERING 
SO GO IN THERE I'M NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING MORE BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO BE SAYING A LOT 
MARK MY WORDS GO AND HAVE A LOOK OFF WE GO 
I'VE SUDDENLY GOT A BAD FEELING SUDDENLY JUST HERE 
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT WE FORGOT TO SAY IT IS CLOSE TO WORK 
TOO LATE FOR THAT 
RIGHT SIMON LET'S SWING INTO ACTION I LIKE THAT 
WOULD YOU CALL THIS THE CONSERVATORY VERANDAH INDEED 
LEAN TO 
THE PINE 
O. K. SO WE'RE BRACING OURSELVES FOR A PROJECT 
YOU'VE GOT NICE QUARRY TILE FLOORS A LOT OF LIGHT THEY'RE MISSING THAT 
LOOKS LIKE A NICE GARDEN AND VIEWS PLENTY OF GLASS 
NO FOCUS ON THE HOUSE 
THIS IS SMALL HOW MUCH ROOM DO YOU NEED TO CRACK AN EGG NOT MUCH 
OBVIOUSLY A PROJECT FOR THE KITCHEN TOO 
YOU COULD OPEN THE KITCHEN UP INTO THE CONSERVATORY SPACE 
RAYBURN WHICH IS WARM IT'S ALREADY VERY WARM IN HERE 
THAT'S WORKING WELL O. K. THAT'S WARM SO YOU'D RIP EVERYTHING OUT 
I'M NOT 
OH RIGHT IT'S GOT THE BEAMS WHICH IS WHAT WE ASKED FOR 
A FIREPLACE THAT'S NOT TOO BAD 
THAT IS A WORKING FIREPLACE 
IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH ROOM THERE IS IN THE REST OF THE HOUSE BUT THIS IS QUITE COSY IT'S QUITE SWEET 
COSY SNUG SWEET 
A LITTLE SITTING ROOM WITHOUT EVERYTHING IN IT 
AND YOU'D TAKE THAT OUT YOU COULD THEN REDESIGN IT 
I'M GUESSING THAT IS THE FIREPLACE IT'S A BIT DATED THAT'S TRUE 
COS THIS IS FAR TOO SMALL YOU'D NEVER GET OUR FURNITURE IN HERE 
YOU'D NEVER GET U. S. IN HERE THAT'S A POINT 
PAUL IS A BIG FELLA AND HE IS FEELING CLAUSTROPHOBIC IN THERE 
THIS IS WHERE THEIR DINING TABLE IS AND IT'S RIGHT UP AGAINST THE WALL 
IT'S BACK TO HOW SMALL IT IS YOU CAN'T MANOEUVRE YOURSELF AROUND THE FURNITURE 
WELL COTTAGES BY THEIR VERY NATURE TEND TO BE QUITE SMALL 
WHAT WILL THEY SAY ABOUT THE BEDROOM 
YOU'D HAVE TO RIP THIS OUT AND START AGAIN IT'S A QUEEN SIZE BED SO YOU'D BE O. K. 
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR BEDROOM DOWN HERE NO BUT IF YOU WERE TO USE IT THAT WAY YOU COULD DO THAT 
IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD OFFICE SPACE IT'S A BIT DARK 
IT'S DARK BECAUSE THE WINDOW IS BEING SUFFOCATED BY OLD NETS GET 'EM DOWN AND NICE WINDOW TREATMENT 
IT'S A BATHROOM OH RIGHT 
WELL THIS IS TINY AND IT'S GOT SOME NICE COLOURS 
WHAT COLOUR WOULD WE SAY THAT IS A CLARET A BURGUNDY YES 
BURNT UMBER GO FOR BURGUNDY MARVELLOUS 
IT'S GOT A FUNNY FEEL ABOUT IT 
IT'S GOT A. 
IT'S ALMOST THERE'S A BIT OF MOTION SICKNESS UP HERE 
WHY IS THAT IS THE FLOOR NOT LEVEL 
IT WASN'T LEVEL IN THE KITCHEN IT'S AN OLDE WORLDE COTTAGEY FEEL IT'S ON A SLANT 
I LOVE THAT OLDE WORLDE STRIPPEDY WOODY DRIFTY WOODY THING 
HE'S STRUGGLING TO FIND COMPLIMENTS 
COMPUTER SPACE MM HMM 
O. K. 
I CAN SEE DAYLIGHT THROUGH THAT FLOOR 
YOU'VE GOT DAYLIGHT COMING THROUGH THE WINDOWS BUT ALSO THROUGH THE FLOOR UPLIGHTING 
THAT COSTS A FORTUNE IT'S A TREND 
SO THIS IS REALLY BRIGHT 
YEAH IT'S GOT STORAGE 
TWO WINDOWS NOT A BAD SIZE 
AGAIN ANOTHER SPACE THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE RIPPED OUT 
AND REJIGGED 
THERE'S A CERTAIN CHARACTER TO THE PLACE 
IT'S REALLY HARD SOMETIMES TO SEE PAST THE DECOR 
WE LOVE CLAIRE SHE'S LOOKING THROUGH THE DECOR SHE'S BEING VERY PERCEPTIVE 
THAT'S IMPORTANT WHEN PEOPLE GO INTO A HOUSE 
IF IT'S NOT THEIR TASTE THEY DON'T WANT IT USE SOME IMAGINATION 
HOW MANY BEDROOMS IS THAT THREE YEAH 
THAT INCLUDES THE ONE DOWNSTAIRS AND NOT THAT BIG REALLY EITHER 
SO YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING AT A TWO BEDROOM 
THEY'RE REARRANGING THE FLOOR PLAN TO ONLY ALLOW THEM TWO BEDROOMS 
SORRY I THINK I MIGHT CATCH THAT TRAIN AND DISAPPEAR OFF YEAH 
TRAIN GOING BY DID YOU HEAR THAT INDEED 
YOU COULD WATCH THEM FROM YOUR BED GET YOUR NUMBERS OUT 
PAUL'S A BIT OF A TRAINSPOTTER YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL WHAT THIS WILL BE A VERY BRIEF ENCOUNTER 
BUT THERE MAY BE POTENTIAL IN THE LAND OUTSIDE 
IF WE LOOK AT THAT THEN HAVE A CHAT ABOUT IT ALL YEAH O. K. 
WE'VE GOT OUR WORK CUT OUT LET'S SELL THEM THIS OUTSIDE SPACE 
I'M SURE YOU'RE CHOMPING AT THE BIT TO SEE THE GROUNDS AND WHAT GROUNDS YOU HAVE 
NEARLY FOUR ACRES SO A LOT OF SPACE AROUND THAT COMPACT COTTAGE 
THEN WHAT CLAIRE WANTED A MENAGE 
IT'S HERE AND STABLES YEAH 
I NEED TO ASK YOU WITH ALL SINCERITY IS IT TOO MUCH LAND 
NO IT'S A MANAGEABLE SIZE IT'S HALF WHAT WE HAVE NOW 
SO THAT'S WHAT WE CAN MANAGE QUITE EASILY AND IT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER THINGS TOO 
YOU COULD EVEN RUN A BUSINESS HERE AND STABLE OTHER PEOPLE'S HORSES 
YEAH I'D LIKE TO LOOK AT THAT YOU'D BE UP FOR THAT DEFINITELY VERY GOOD 
YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKED ABOUT YOU WHEN YOU WERE WALKING AROUND THIS PROPERTY WHAT YOUR IMAGINATION 
YOUR ABILITY TO LOOK AT THIS PLACE AND IT IS A BIT DATED VERY 
BUT WITH A BIT OF IMAGINATION YOU COULD REALLY UPDATE THIS PLACE 
YOU COULD IT HAS THE POTENTIAL 
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO SEE PAST WHAT'S ALREADY HERE 
I THINK YOU JUST RIP IT ALL OUT AND START AGAIN YOU HAVE A BLANK CANVAS AND YOU BUILD ON IT FROM THERE 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE SPACE EXACTLY 
I KNOW YOU'RE UNSURE ABOUT THIS PLACE BUT LET'S JOIN THE OTHERS 
AND WE MIGHT JUST SHOW YOU WHY WE PICKED THIS AS OUR WILD CARD O. K. 
OUR WILD CARD IS A CHARMING COTTAGE WITH AN IDYLLIC PLOT OF LAND 
BUT IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO A MAJOR TRAIN LINE 
PROPERTY PARTICULARS RARELY TELL YOU THAT SO IF NOISE IS AN ISSUE 
SCOUT AROUND THE AREA PRIOR TO THE VIEWING 
YOU GO FIRST PAUL GIVE US A PRICE FOR THIS 
I WOULD SAY WITH THE LAND THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER THINGS AROUND FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY 
CLAIRE COME ON THE PRESSURE'S ON 
I'M REALLY SCARED SO I'M GONNA G. O. FOUR EIGHTY FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY 
BECAUSE THE ACTUAL PRICE ON THE NOSE IS FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE SHE NEEDED TO WIN SOMETHING 
O. K. MORE IMPORTANTLY DO EXCUSE ME DEAR FRIEND 
DOWN HERE I HAVE A LAPTOP 
WE NEED YOU TO DECIDE WHICH PROPERTY TO TEST DRIVE 
A CHANCE TO SPEND TIME IN A PROPERTY AND SEE IF IT FEELS LIKE HOME 
IN THIS LAPTOP ARE IMAGES PRICES ALL THE VIEWS SO YOU CAN DECIDE 
WHO DO I ENTRUST THIS WITH NEITHER OF YOU 
LET ME TAKE THAT DISAPPEAR OFF AND WE'LL SEE YOU LATER ON 
THANK YOU GO GO GO 
AND WHILE THEY MAKE THAT IMPORTANT DECISION HERE'S A REMINDER FOR YOU 
PROPERTY ONE IS THIS COUNTRY COTTAGE 
ITS FOUR BEDROOMS AND THREE RECEPTION ROOMS SIMPLY OOZE CHARM 
AND THERE'S AN ACRE OF MATURE GARDEN 
IT COULD BE THEIRS FOR FOUR HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
MY DEAR FRIEND I AM GOING TO WIN BY A MILE WITH MY CHOICE 
THIS CLASSY FOUR BEDROOM BARN CONVERSION 
THE VIEW ALONE MAKES THIS PROPERTY 
WORTH EVERY PENNY OF THE FIVE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY PRICE TAG 
MAYBE OUR WILD CARD WILL BE A DARK HORSE A PERIOD DETACHED HOUSE 
WITH A THREE ACRE PADDOCK OFFERING BUSINESS POTENTIAL PLUS TWO HOURS LESS COMMUTING A DAY 
PRICE 
THREE PROPERTIES WHICH ONE WILL PAUL AND CLAIRE CANTER OFF TO 
PROPERTY ONE WONDERFUL EXTERIOR I REALLY LIKE IT 
PICTURE POSTCARD ISN'T IT SO BEAUTIFULLY PRESENTED 
THAT CONSERVATORY WAS A USEFUL SPACE 
THAT KITCHEN IS GORGEOUS WITH ALL THOSE TILES I LOVE THOSE TILES 
BEDROOMS LOVELY UNITS THERE 
JUST A BIT SMALL PROPERTY TWO 
O. K. EXCELLENT I REALLY LIKED IT IT WAS LOVELY 
IT'S BEAUTIFULLY DONE RECENTLY DONE TOO I LOVED THE KITCHEN 
THOSE BEAMS IN THERE AND THE UNITS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
BEDROOMS AGAIN ON THE SMALL SIDE 
THREE HAD ALL THE EXTERIOR STUFF THAT WE WERE WANTING 
IT HAD ALL THE LAND IT HAD THE MENAGE BUT THE HOUSE IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH MONEY TO DO 
THE GARDENS WERE WELL LAID OUT IT HAD REAL POTENTIAL 
WHAT WORRIED ME WAS THE RAILWAY LINE NEXT TO THE HOUSE 
I'VE GOT A GOOD IDEA WHERE I'M GOING I THINK I HAVE TOO 
PAUL AND CLAIRE WHAT A REVELATION 
BECAUSE YOU'VE DECIDED THE ONE YOU WANTED TO TEST DRIVE WAS MY CHOICE 
THE CONVERTED BARN MUTTER MUTTER MUTTER HE'S ANGRY YOU CAN TELL 
SO WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO COME BACK TO THIS ONE FOR A SECOND LOOK 
WELL I THINK THE POTENTIAL OF THE LAND THE LOCATION 
THE FACT THE HOUSE IS SO BEAUTIFUL INSIDE HAS JUST TEMPTED US BACK 
BEFORE YOU DO YOUR TEST DRIVE OUR PROPERTY SURVEYOR HAS GIVEN THIS HOUSE A THOROUGH GOING OVER 
THIS IS NOT A LEGALLY BINDING SURVEY 
AND IF YOU'RE BUYING A PROPERTY HAVE A FULLER SURVEY DONE BY A QUALIFIED SURVEYOR 
OUR CANTANKEROUS OLD BADGER LOVES TO FIND FAULT IN PROPERTIES AND HE HASN'T FOUND ANY HERE 
YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED IN PLACES THERE WERE GAPS BETWEEN THE PLASTERBOARD AND THE BEAMS 
AND EVEN BETWEEN THE FLOOR AND THE WALLS 
IN ONE AREA YOU CAN GET YOUR FINGER UNDER THE SKIRTING 
BUT IT IS NATURAL FOR A GREEN OAK FRAME TO SHRINK LIKE THIS SO WHEN YOU DECORATE JUST CLOSE THE GAPS 
IF YOU BUY A PROPERTY YOU CHECK OUT YOUR BOUNDARIES BUT HERE'S A CURIOUS THING 
SOME OF THE LAND IS AGRICULTURAL AND SOME IS DOMESTIC 
IT'S GREEN BELT AGRICULTURAL SO YOU CAN DO CERTAIN THINGS WITH THAT AND WITH DOMESTIC LAND 
SO YOU NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT YOUR DOMESTIC CURTILAGE IS WHAT YOU CAN AND CAN'T DO 
I'VE SAID ENOUGH GET IN THERE AND DO YOUR TEST DRIVE SEE YOU LATER 
YOU AND I NEED TO TALK ABOUT SKIRTING AND CURTILAGE NO NO

WE'VE HAD A GOOD OLD TOUR CERTAINLY HAVE NOW YOU'VE HAD YOUR TEST DRIVE IT'S DECISION TIME 
SO HAVE YOU GIVEN IT SOME THOUGHT ARE YOU GOING TO BARTER OR SCARPER 
WE'VE GIVEN IT LOTS OF THOUGHT HAVEN'T WE WE HAVE INDEED 
PARTICULARLY WITH THIS ONE WHICH WE REALLY LIKE 
IT'S TAKING A LONG TIME TO GET AN ANSWER 
MILKING THE MOMENT WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO SCARPER 
SCARPER IT SHOULD BE LOVELY BUT IT'S NOT WE SHOULD BE REJOICING WHAT WENT WRONG 
IT'S SLIGHTLY ABOVE OUR PRICE RANGE FOR A PROPERTY FOR OURSELVES 
BUT INCLUDED WITHIN THE PRICE THAT WE COULD AFFORD TO BRING THE PARENTS IT JUST ISN'T BIG ENOUGH 
WITH THE PLANNING PERMISSION ON THAT THERE WOULD BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING CURTILAGE 
TALKING CURTILAGE WHAT CAN I SAY YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
