IT'S YOUR BACON RATION FOR THE WEEK SO YOU MAY AS WELL ENJOY IT 
THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FEW YEARS MAY WELL DECIDE 
THE FUTURE OF CIVILISATION FOR DECADES OR FOR CENTURIES 
OH YOU LUCKY PEOPLE 
IF BY AN ACT OF SCIENTIFIC MAGIC A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE 
FROM POST WAR BRITAIN COULD TRAVEL THROUGH TIME WHAT WOULD THEY MAKE OF US 
WE'RE FAR WEALTHIER NOW AND YET THEY WERE MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN WE ARE 
MANY OF THEM HAD KNOWN HUNGER NOTHING WAS WASTED 
VERY FEW HAD EVER BEEN ABROAD EXCEPT TO FIGHT 
ALMOST ALL OF THEM WERE WHITE 
THEIR BRITAIN WAS A COUNTRY OF NOISY FACTORIES AND COAL SMOKE 
A COUNTRY EVEN MORE SHARPLY DIVIDED BY REGION AND CLASS 
YET THESE SHABBY OPTIMISTIC PEOPLE WERE US 
THESE FLOPPY HAIRED CHILDREN ARE OUR PENSIONERS NOW 
AND THEIR CHOICES MADE US WHAT WE ARE 
IN THIS SERIES I'M GOING TO TELL THE STORY OF THIS AMAZING TRANSFORMATION 
THE PEOPLE WHO COME OUT OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR ARE HUNGRY FOR THE PLEASURES OF PEACE 
THE ROAD AHEAD IS GOING TO BE BUMPY AND FULL OF NASTY SURPRISES 
THE GAP BETWEEN THEM AND US IS LESS THAN THE SPAN OF A HUMAN LIFETIME 
IT'S EASY TO THINK WE KNOW THIS STORY BUT THE MORE YOU LOOK AT IT 
THE ODDER THE MORE MOVING AND THE GRANDER IT REALLY IS 
OUR INNER FEARS OFTEN TAKE SHAPE MYSTERIOUSLY WHILE WE'RE ASLEEP WAITING TO POUNCE WHEN WE AWAKE 
ON THE MORNING OF JULY TWENTY SIXTH NINETEEN FORTY FIVE WINSTON CHURCHILL WOKE UP 
WITH WHAT HE CALLED A SHARP STAB OF ALMOST PHYSICAL PAIN 
HE'D JUST FOUGHT ONE OF THE FEW REALLY BAD CAMPAIGNS OF HIS LIFE 
AND HE WAS SUDDENLY SURE HE'D LOST THE GENERAL ELECTION 
HE WAS QUITE RIGHT 
HARDLY ANYONE SEEMS TO HAVE EXPECTED THIS 
NOT HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS NOT THE NEWSPAPERS NOT THE KING 
NOT STALIN IN MOSCOW NOT THE AMERICANS EITHER 
AFTER ALL ONLY THREE MONTHS EARLIER THE CROWDS HAD POURED 
ONTO THE LONDON STREETS TO CHEER THEIR WARTIME LEADER 
THIS SURELY WAS CHURCHILL'S HOUR 
THIS IS YOUR VICTORY 
AND HE'D SUMMONED THE VISION OF AN EVEN GREATER FUTURE 
WITH THE IMPERIAL RALLYING CRY ADVANCE BRITANNIA 
AND WHY NOT BRITAIN IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE STILL CONTROLLED 
THE WORLD'S GREATEST EMPIRE A QUARTER OF ALL THE PEOPLE ALIVE ON EARTH 
AND CHURCHILL WAS A LIVING SYMBOL OF BRITISH POWER 
BUT THE BRITISH PEOPLE PROVED TO BE A STROPPY LOT UNPREDICTABLE AND UNSENTIMENTAL 
THEIR FIRST BIG DECISION AS THE WAR DREW TO AN END WAS TO DUMP THEIR WARTIME LEADER 
THEY EVEN HECKLED HIM 
I CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT AN ENORMOUS MASS OF 
OF WORK 
WE WANT CLEMENT WE WANT CLEMENT WE WANT CLEMENT 
CLEMENT ATTLEE'S LABOUR PARTY WON BY A LANDSLIDE 
CHURCHILL MUCH ENJOYED MOCKING ATTLEE 
A MODEST LITTLE MAN WITH MUCH TO BE MODEST ABOUT 
OR AN EMPTY TAXI DREW UP AT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND ATTLEE GOT OUT 
BUT CHURCHILL WASN'T LAUGHING NOW 
NOR SHALL THE SWORD SLEEP IN MY HAND TILL WE HAVE BUILT JERUSALEM IN ENGLAND'S GREEN AND PLEASANT LAND 
CLEMENT ATTLEE WAS ONE OF ONLY TWO PRIME MINISTERS WHO REALLY CHANGED MODERN BRITAIN 
THE OTHER WAS MARGARET THATCHER 
AND THERE THE COMPARISON ENDS 
ATTLEE WAS A QUIET HUMDRUM FELLOW 
A PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATED TIMES CROSSWORD OBSESSED 
OLD FASHIONED DO GOODER OF THE VERY BEST SORT 
EVERYBODY WHO REALLY KNEW ABOUT POLITICS KNEW THAT CLEM WAS JUST GOING TO BE A STOP GAP 
EVEN SOME OF ATTLEE'S OWN M. P.'S THOUGHT HE WASN'T UP TO THE JOB 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ELECTION VICTORY THEY POURED IN HERE FROM ALL ROUND BRITAIN 
TO THIS HALL AT WESTMINSTER FOR A VICTORY CELEBRATION 
AND AS THEY WERE GOSSIPING IN THE CORRIDORS AND TOILETS 
SWIRLING AROUND EXCHANGING CAMPAIGN STORIES A PLOT DEVELOPED 
IT WAS TO HOLD A LEADERSHIP ELECTION 
GET RID OF ATTLEE AND PUT IN HERBERT MORRISON 
NOW HERBERT WAS A WILY POLITICAL OPERATOR EXPERIENCED MINISTER VERY POPULAR IN THE LABOUR PARTY 
SO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MORRISON GOVERNMENT OF NINETEEN FORTY FIVE 
TOO LATE HERBERT EVEN AS THE M. P.'S PLOTTED TO GET RID OF HIM 
ATTLEE AND HIS WIFE VI WERE POOTLING QUIETLY IN THEIR MODEST LITTLE CAR 
TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE 
AND THERE A MILDLY SURPRISED KING GEORGE THE SIXTH DULY HANDED HIM CONTROL 
OVER BRITAIN AND ITS SPRAWLING EMPIRE 
HOORAY HOORAY HOORAY MISERY'S ON THE WAY 
THERE ARE BAD TIMES JUST AROUND THE CORNER 
THERE ARE DARK CLOUDS HURTLING THROUGH THE SKY 
BRITAIN DIDN'T LOOK LIKE A GLITTERING PRIZE 
A QUARTER OF A MILLION HOMES HAD BEEN DESTROYED IN THE WAR 
FACTORIES WERE CLAPPED OUT OR SHATTERED AND THE PEOPLE GRIMY AND TIRED 
AS THEY WAITED FOR THE ARMIES TO COME HOME CIVILIANS CROWDED 
INTO THE DANCE HALLS AND CINEMAS 
TO ESCAPE THE CHILLY BOREDOM OF EVERYDAY LIFE 
THERE ARE BAD TIMES JUST AROUND THE CORNER 
CLEMENT ATTLEE HAD WON A HUGE PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY BY PROMISING 
TO BUILD A COUNTRY OF FAIR SHARES FOR ALL WHERE THE SICK JOBLESS OLD AND POOR WOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF 
ATTLEE'S NEW JERUSALEM HAD BEEN PLANNED HERE 
IN OLD BLACKPOOL DURING THE WAR 
AN ARMY OF EVACUATED CIVIL SERVANTS FURIOUSLY TYPING AWAY IN FOUR HUNDRED HOTELS 
AND BED AND BREAKFASTS CREATED WHAT IS STILL THE CORE OF BRITAIN'S WELFARE SYSTEM 
THE MAN BEHIND THE PLAN WASN'T A SOCIALIST AT ALL 
HE WAS A PURITANICAL LIBERAL CALLED WILLIAM BEVERIDGE 
I HOPE THAT WHEN YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO STUDY THE REPORT IN DETAIL YOU'LL LIKE IT 
THAT IT'LL GET ADOPTED 
WILLIAM BEVERIDGE GOT UP EVERY MORNING AT SIX FOR AN ICY BATH 
AND THEN HE SPENT THE REST OF THE DAY WALLOWING IN COLD STATISTICS 
HE BELIEVED IN HARD WORK AND CLEAN LIVING FOR EVERYONE 
BUT ALSO THAT ANYONE WHO WAS GENUINELY IN TROUBLE 
BECAUSE OF SICKNESS OR UNEMPLOYMENT SHOULD BE HELPED 
THIS WAS THE POETRY OF FAIRNESS 
WANT MUST NOT BE KNOWN AGAIN 
IDLENESS THERE MUST BE NO MASS UNEMPLOYMENT 
IGNORANCE SAID SIR WILLIAM NO DEMOCRACY CAN NOWADAYS AFFORD 
DISEASE THE EVIL OF DISEASE MUST BE OVERTHROWN 
SQUALOR NO MORE GENERATIONS MUST BE STUNTED IN SQUALOR 
THE BEVERIDGE REPORT SHOWS HOW TO BEGIN OVERTHROWING THE FIVE GIANT EVILS 
AND INSPIRES US ALL TO GREATER EFFORT 
BRITISH BOMBERS DROPPED COPIES OF THE BEVERIDGE REPORT 
ACROSS OCCUPIED EUROPE AS PROPAGANDA 
BRITISH DIPLOMATS CARRIED IT TO WASHINGTON AND MOSCOW 
AND WHEN THE RUSSIANS BROKE INTO HITLER'S BUNKER AT THE END OF THE WAR 
THEY FOUND A SPECIAL PAPER PREPARED FOR THE FUHRER 
WHICH SAID THAT THE BEVERIDGE REPORT WAS SUPERIOR 
TO ANY SYSTEM OF SOCIAL INSURANCE DREAMT UP BY THE GERMANS 
WILLIAM BEVERIDGE NOT AS PRETTY AS A SPITFIRE BUT A BRITISH NATIONAL TRIUMPH 
NOW CLEMENT ATTLEE WAS ABOUT TO PICK UP BEVERIDGE'S PLAN 
AND MAKE IT THE HEART OF LABOUR'S NEW JERUSALEM 
POWER AND PLANNING WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG 
WITHIN WEEKS OF THE ELECTION THE WAR WITH JAPAN CAME TO AN END 
TRIGGERING A SERIES OF EVENTS 
WHICH WOULD TURN LABOUR'S PLANS UPSIDE DOWN 
AND HAUNT THIS COUNTRY FOR DECADES TO COME 
WE'D FOUGHT THE WAR WITH AMERICAN GUNS 
WE'D SURVIVED ON AMERICAN LOANS WE'D EATEN AMERICAN FOOD 
AND NOW WITHOUT WARNING AMERICA'S PRESIDENT TRUMAN PULLED THE PLUG 
FOR BRITAIN THE EFFECTS WERE CLOSE TO CATASTROPHIC 
BUT THERE WAS WORSE TO COME 
HAVING CUT OFF OUR LIFELINE THE AMERICANS NOW SENT US THE BILL 
FOR EVERYTHING WE HAD BORROWED DURING THE WAR 
BRITAIN HAD ONCE BEEN THE WORLD'S BANKER 
WE WERE NOW THE WORLD'S SINGLE BIGGEST DEBTOR NATION 
WE OWED THREE POINT FIVE BILLION TO OTHER COUNTRIES 
BRITAIN WAS ONLY WEEKS AWAY FROM GOING BANKRUPT 
ATTLEE REALISED THAT ALL HIS PLANS FOR RE BUILDING BRITAIN WERE SUDDENLY ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE 
HE TURNED TO THE ECONOMIST JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES AND SENT HIM TO WASHINGTON 
HIS MISSION WAS TO ARGUE THE CASE FOR A GIFT OR INTEREST FREE LOAN OF UP TO EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS 
KEYNES WAS AN ECONOMIC GENIUS HE WAS QUITE POSSIBLY THE CLEVEREST MAN THEN ALIVE IN BRITAIN 
BUT HE WAS SENT HERE TO THE U. S. FEDERAL RESERVE THE NATIONAL PIGGY BANK OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO BEG 
BECAUSE DURING THE WAR THE AMERICAN ECONOMY HAD BOOMED AND OURS HAD BEEN FLATTENED 
POLLS SHOWED SIXTY PER CENT OF AMERICANS WERE AGAINST GIVING US A LOAN NEVER MIND A FREE GIFT 
THE BRITISH WERE IMPERIALISTS AFTER ALL AND NOW THEY WERE SOCIALISTS TOO 
AS KEYNES MARCHED SLOWLY UP THE MARBLE STEPS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE 
HE WAS UNDER TERRIBLE PRESSURE 
HE WAS SERIOUSLY ILL WITH A WEAK HEART 
BUT HE HAD PROMISED ATTLEE THAT HE ALONE COULD SAVE BRITAIN 
WHEN THE TIME FINALLY CAME TO PUT BRITAIN'S CASE 
KEYNES'S PERFORMANCE WAS SPARKLING 
EVERY LAST DETAIL OF BRITAIN'S AWFUL DILEMMA WAS LAID BARE 
EVERY QUESTION HE WAS ASKED ANSWERED IN DETAIL AND IN FULL 
HE HELD COURT FOR THREE SOLID DAYS 
PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE SAID IT WAS THE FINEST EXPOSITION THEY HAD EVER HEARD OR WERE EVER LIKELY TO HEAR 
AND AT THE END OF IT ALL THE AMERICANS SAID NO 
AND NO AND NO AND THEN MAYBE 
THEIR MINDS ARE SO SMALL KEYNES ANGRILY WROTE 
AS THE UNEQUAL HAGGLING DRAGGED ON FOR THREE STIFLING MONTHS 
KEYNES EMERGED EXHAUSTED WITH NO GIFT 
BUT A LOAN OF JUST UNDER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WITH INTEREST 
JUST HALF OF WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS VITAL 
AND NOW WASHINGTON ADDED A FINAL VERY DANGEROUS CONDITION 
EXCHANGE CONTROLS WHICH HAD PROTECTED THE POUND AND THE WEAK BRITISH ECONOMY 
MUST COME DOWN TWELVE MONTHS AFTER THE LOAN BEGAN 
KEYNES WAS FURIOUS BUT THIS WAS TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT TIME AND WE TOOK IT 
THE LAST OF THAT LOAN WAS FINALLY PAID OFF IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX 
CLEMENT ATTLEE PUT ON A BRAVE FACE HE WELCOMED THE LOAN 
JERUSALEM MIGHT STILL BE BUILT AFTER ALL 
YET BRITAIN'S FUTURE WAS NOW FIRMLY IN AMERICAN HANDS 
AS FOR KEYNES HE HAD SHATTERED HIMSELF IN THE SERVICE OF HIS COUNTRY 
AND HE DIED SHORTLY AFTERWARDS 
THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE FIRST OF THE AMERICAN MONEY BEGAN TO ARRIVE 
AS BRITAIN CAME TO TERMS WITH ECONOMIC DEPENDENCE ON WASHINGTON 
A FILM PRODUCER CALLED MICHAEL BALCON 
WAS FIGHTING FOR BRITAIN'S CULTURAL INDEPENDENCE 
HIS DETERMINATION TO PRESERVE A DISTINCTIVLY BRITISH CINEMA AT EALING STUDIOS MAKES HIM FOR MY MONEY 
THE MOST IMPORTANT CULTURAL FIGURE OF THE TIME 
I DO HAPPEN TO THINK THAT THE ONLY SORT 
OF NATIONALISM THAT'S WORTH A DAMN IS CULTURAL NATIONALISM AND I THINK THAT SHOULD APPLY TO FILMS 
WE WANTED THEM TO BE ABSOLUTELY ROOTED IN THE SOIL OF THIS COUNTRY 
BALCON'S CULTURAL NATIONALISM HAD BEEN FIRED UP 
BY HIS OWN PERSONAL ENCOUNTER WITH AMERICAN ECONOMIC SWAGGER AND MUSCLE 
HE KNEW HOLLYWOOD HE'D WORKED THERE AND FALLEN OUT VICIOUSLY WITH THE GREAT AMERICAN MOGUL LOUIS B. MAYER 
WHO SAID HE'D DESTROY BALCON IF IT COSTS ME A MILLION DOLLARS 
BALCON TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND CAME HOME HERE TO WEST LONDON TO SET UP OPERATION ANTI HOLLYWOOD 
THIS IS BRITAIN'S REBEL FACTORY OF DREAMS 
THE FIRST EALING COMEDY HUE AND CRY 
WAS FILMED IN THE RUINS OF POST WAR LONDON 
AND THIS REALLY WAS A CITY WITH GANGS OF FERAL CHILDREN HIDING OUT IN SHATTERED STREETS 
LONDON'S POPULATION HAD SHRUNK BY TWO MILLION DURING THE WAR 
AND IT WAS STILL RIFE WITH ARMED GANGS AND DESERTERS 
WILD LONDON WOULD SOON BE TAMED 
A VIGOROUS PROGRESSIVE BELIEF IN A BETTER TOMORROW WAS A HALLMARK OF EALING FILMS 
BUT IT WAS A YOUTHFUL OPTIMISM MANY IN BRITAIN COULDN'T SHARE 
OH HOW I LOATHE ADVENTUROUS MINDED BOYS 
THE ATTLEE GOVERNMENT WAS STRUGGLING TO PAY OFF BRITAIN'S DEBTS 
BY EXPORTING MOST OF WHAT THE COUNTRY PRODUCED 
THIS DIDN'T LEAVE MUCH IN THE SHOPS AND THE AGE OF MAKE DO AND MEND 
WAS GETTING AS BIZARRE AS ANY EALING COMEDY 
ALL THESE HATS ARE MADE FROM RUGS AND CARPETS 
SO IF YOU'VE GOT ANY OLD BITS OF AXMINSTER WILTON BUKHARA 
OR EVEN A SPARE BATH MAT WHY NOT CUT 'EM UP AND BE IN THE FASHION 
BY NOW RATIONING IS BITING EVEN MORE TIGHTLY THAN DURING THE WORST DAYS OF THE WAR 
HERE'S MY QUOTA 
SIX OUNCES OF BUTTER SUGAR A VERY SMALL PIECE OF COOKING FAT 
A MEAGRE PIECE OF CHEESE ONE EGG TWO PINTS OF MILK A PIECE OF MEAT 
THAT'S BARELY LARGER THAN AN I POD 
AND BY NOW NEVER HAPPENED DURING THE WAR EVEN BREAD IS RATIONED 
THIS IS PERFECTLY SUFFICIENT FOR A MEAL 
IT WOULD GET YOU BY ALL RIGHT FOR A DAY 
BUT THIS IS MY RATION FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK 
AND RATIONING GOES ON AND ON 
MEAT IS STILL BEING RATIONED IN NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR 
THAT'S YOUR RATION FOR THE WEEK THERE'S NO MORE IS THIS ALL 
THAT'S THE LOT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THAT WHAT YOU LIKE 
COULD YOU SAY A FEW WORDS FOR MOVIETONE NEWS 
NO I NEVER SAY ANY WORDS 
THE LIVING SYMBOL OF ATTLEE'S AUSTERITY BRITAIN 
WAS THE STERN FIGURE OF SIR STAFFORD CRIPPS 
FORMER MARXIST CHRISTIAN VEGETARIAN 
PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE AND ALL ROUND PAIN IN THE BUM 
LIKE THE FAMILY HOUSEKEEPER 
I OFTEN HAVE TO REFUSE YOU ALL SORTS OF THINGS 
I KNOW THIS CHRISTMAS WON'T BE A LUXURY ONE AND THAT YOU HOUSEWIVES 
ARE GOING TO HAVE A HARD JOB MAKING A CHRISTMAS SHOW 
I KNOW YOU WANT TO HEAR THE TRUTH 
I ONLY WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY NO 
OH YEAH 
WELL I'M NOT MOVING ANYWAY I BEG YOUR PARDON 
IF THE NAZIS COULDN'T DRIVE ME OUT OF MY HOME WITH ALL THEIR BOMBS 
YOU DON'T CATCH ME PACKING UP NOW 
HERE HERE TIME AND AGAIN EALING FILMS CATCH THE POLITICAL MOMENT WITH UNCANNY PRECISION 
FANCY A NICE BIT OF BREAM FOR YOUR SUPPER 
THERE WAS A GROWING REBELLION AGAINST RATIONING AND THE ENDLESS NO 
OF SIR STAFFORD CRIPPS AND IT'S CAPTURED IN THE BEST OF ALL OF THEM PASSPORT TO PIMLICO 
IT'S A FANTASY ABOUT A FEW STREETS IN LONDON THAT DECLARE INDEPENDENCE FROM THE REST OF BRITAIN 
BLIMEY I'M A FOREIGNER 
BURGUNDY BURGUNDY 
TO GREAT CELEBRATION 
RATIONING IS BROUGHT TO AN END BY THE NEW BREAKAWAY COUNTRY OF BURGUNDY 
COME TO THINK OF IT I SHAN'T NEED THIS ANY MORE EITHER 
THAT'S THE STUFF SCRAP 'EM ALL 
THE PEOPLE OF PIMLICO RIP UP THEIR RATION BOOKS AND GORGE THEMSELVES ON BLACK MARKET GOODS 
LOVELY BLACK MARKET BUTTER 
IN THE LINE PLEASE MADAM 
THE GOVERNMENT TRIES TO STARVE THEM INTO SUBMISSION BUT ORDINARY LONDONERS COME TO THE RESCUE 
THIS WASN'T JUST GLORIOUS EALING FANTASY 
A REAL REVOLT LONG FORGOTTEN WITH STRIKING ECHOES OF PIMLICO WAS UNDER WAY ALL OVER BRITAIN 
PEOPLE WAITING FOR HOMES HAD LOST PATIENCE WITH THE GOVERNMENT 
FLOUTING THE LAW THEY SIMPLY SEIZED ANY SHELTER THEY COULD FIND 
AND I FELT IF IT WAS RIGHT FOR ANIMALS TO BE PUT IN 
IT WAS MUCH MORE RIGHT THAT HOMELESS HUMAN BEINGS SHOULD HAVE THEM 
WE TAKE THE VIEW THAT ANY RIGHT MINDED MEN 
WOULD AGREE WITH THE ACTIONS OUR DESPERATION FORCED US TO TAKE 
THE GREAT SQUATTING REVOLT CAME TO A HEAD ON A WET SUNDAY AFTERNOON 
IN SEPTEMBER NINETEEN FORTY SIX WHEN HERE IN KENSINGTON HIGH STREET 
ABOUT ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE SUDDENLY CONVERGED 
MOST OF THEM WERE YOUNG MARRIED COUPLES WITH CHILDREN AND BABIES 
MOST OF THEM WERE CARRYING SUITCASES 
BUT THIS WAS A HIGHLY ORGANISED OPERATION 
THE LONDON COMMUNIST PARTY HAD SEIZED THE ISSUE 
AND FROM HERE RIGHT THE WAY DOWN TO NEARLY AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE 
EMPTY PROPERTIES WERE DULY BROKEN INTO AND TAKEN OVER 
WHAT SORT OF ACCOMMODATION DID YOU HAVE MRS. BARNES 
I HAD ONE ROOM WITH TWO FAMILIES FOUR PEOPLE IN ONE ROOM 
YES SIR FOR A POUND A WEEK THAT SEEMS RATHER MUCH IT DO SIR 
AT FIRST THE RESPONSE WAS ALMOST HILARIOUSLY BRITISH 
THE POLICE DECIDED THE BEST THING THEY COULD DO WAS MAKE ALL THE SQUATTERS A NICE CUP OF TEA 
OUTSIDE THE HOUSES CROWDS FORMED HUMAN CHAINS TO PASS FOOD 
AND CIGARETTES AND CHOCOLATE AND BLANKETS THROUGH TO THE FAMILIES INSIDE 
THE PRESS WAS BROADLY SYMPATHETIC 
STUDENTS MARCHED THROUGH THE CENTRE OF LONDON IN SUPPORT OF THE SQUATTERS 
IN FACT ALTHOUGH THIS WAS ENTIRELY ILLEGAL THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE COUNTRY WAS CHEERILY SYMPATHETIC 
EALING PERFECTLY CAPTURES THIS CLASSIC BRITISH TENSION 
BETWEEN ORDER ON THE ONE HAND RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY QUEUING FAIR SHARES FOR ALL 
AND A TURBULENT BUBBLING UP DEMAND FOR THE GOOD LIFE ON THE OTHER 
NOW IN PASSPORT TO PIMLICO RIGHT AT THE END AUSTERITY BRITAIN WINS OUT 
WE'RE BACK IN ENGLAND 
BUT THE FILM ALSO REMINDS US THAT BRITAIN CAN BE A ROWDY NATION 
WHICH WON'T BE PUSHED TOO FAR 
AND ATTLEE'S PROMISES OF JAM TOMORROW WERE WEARING THIN 
ONE LITTLE BIT OF STEAK ON FRIDAY AND BLIMEY WE'VE HAD IT FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK THEN 
GOOD GOD WHAT DOES A MAN LIVE ON 
ELEVEN PENCE OF MEAT DISGUSTING 
WE FEEL THAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAD LED US UP THE GARDEN PATH 
BROODING FROM THE SIDE LINES AS THE CRISIS DEEPENED WINSTON CHURCHILL 
OBSERVED THAT LABOUR'S INSATIABLE LUST FOR POWER WAS ONLY EQUALLED BY THEIR INCURABLE INCOMPETENCE 
FORCED INTO OPPOSITION HE HAD RETREATED TO CHARTWELL HIS HOME IN KENT 
BUT IN MARCH NINETEEN FORTY SIX CHURCHILL MADE WHAT HE CALLED THE MOST IMPORTANT SPEECH OF HIS LIFE 
WELL THERE ARE A FEW TO CHOOSE FROM BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT 
IT WAS MADE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT TRUMAN 
AND IT ECHOED IMMEDIATELY ACROSS A DIVIDED WORLD 
FROM STETTIN IN THE BALTIC TO TRIESTE IN THE ADRIATIC 
AN IRON CURTAIN HAS DESCENDED ACROSS THE CONTINENT 
BEHIND THAT LINE LIE ALL THE CAPITALS 
OF THE ANCIENT STATES OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE 
CHURCHILL WAS WARNING THE WEST OF A NEW TYRANNY JUST AS DANGEROUS AS THE NAZIS 
BUT HE ALSO MADE AN EQUALLY SIGNIFICANT PRIVATE STATEMENT 
WHILE TRAVELLING ON PRESIDENT TRUMAN'S TRAIN 
CHURCHILL TURNED TO THE PRESIDENT GREAT BRITAIN HAS HAD ITS DAY 
HE SAID NOW AMERICA IS IN THE ASCENDANCY 
THIS IS THE NATION OF THE FUTURE AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE PART OF IT 
HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT IF HE HAD BEEN BORN THEN HE WOULD PREFER TO HAVE BEEN BORN AN AMERICAN 
BLUNT STUFF IT WOULD HAVE SHOCKED A LOT OF PEOPLE BACK HOME 
BUT COMING TO TERMS WITH THAT LOSS OF STATUS 
THAT BUMP DOWN IN THE WORLD 
HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS 
WE HAVE HAD TO LEARN IN THE MODERN WORLD 
AND GIVING UP THE EMPIRE WAS WHERE THIS ALL THAT HAD TO START 
BRITAIN COULDN'T ANY LONGER AFFORD ITS IMPERIAL PRETENSIONS 
CLEMENT ATTLEE KNEW THIS AND INDIAN INDEPENDENCE WAS NOW TOP OF THE GOVERNMENT'S AGENDA 
CHURCHILL EVER THE IMPERIAL ROMANTIC 
HAD SPENT DECADES DOING EVERYTHING HE COULD TO HOLD INDIA INSIDE THE EMPIRE 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WAR HE SAID I DID NOT BECOME THE KING'S FIRST MINISTER 
TO PRESIDE OVER THE DISSOLUTION OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE 
BUT ATTLEE WAS DETERMINED TO CUT THE KNOT 
MILLIONS OF BRITONS SHARED CHURCHILL'S DEEP SADNESS 
THAT THE EMPIRE THEY HAD CREATED AND FOUGHT TO DEFEND WAS NOW CRUMBLING 
WHEN CHURCHILL PRESENTED HIS FINAL SPEECH IN THE INDIAN INDEPENDENCE DEBATE HE SAID 
IT IS WITH DEEP GRIEF THAT I WATCH THE CLATTERING DOWN OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE WITH ALL ITS GLORIES 
MANY HAVE DEFENDED BRITAIN AGAINST HER FOES 
NONE WILL DEFEND HER AGAINST HERSELF 
ON THE FIFTEENTH OF AUGUST NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN 
BRITISH RULE IN INDIA FINALLY CAME TO AN END AFTER NEARLY TWO HUNDRED YEARS 
AT THE STROKE OF THE MIDNIGHT HOUR 
WHEN THE WORLD SLEEPS 
INDIA WILL AWAKE TO LIFE AND FREEDOM 
THE PRICE OF INDEPENDENCE WAS THE PARTITION OF INDIA INTO SEPARATE MUSLIM AND HINDU STATES 
IT WOULD LEAD TO TERRIBLE VIOLENCE AND THE GREATEST FORCED MIGRATION IN HISTORY 
UP TO SIXTEEN MILLION PEOPLE WERE UPROOTED FROM THEIR HOMES 
NO ONE KNOWS HOW MANY DIED IN THE CHAOS 
SOME SAY AS MANY AS A MILLION 
THE ATTLEE GOVERNMENT NOW BEGAN TO TRY TO ESTABLISH 
NEW RELATIONSHIPS WITH BRITAIN'S FORMER COLONIES ALL ROUND THE WORLD 
AND IT PASSED THE BRITISH NATIONALITY ACT WHICH GAVE ABSOLUTE RIGHTS TO COME AND LIVE HERE 
TO MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE FROM ALL ROUND THE COMMONWEALTH 
IT SEEMS ASTONISHING NOW BUT AT THE TIME IT PASSED ALMOST ENTIRELY WITHOUT COMMENT 
NO ONE IMAGINED THAT PEOPLE FROM AFRICA ASIA AND THE WEST INDIES 
WOULD EVER BE ABLE TO TRAVEL TO BRITAIN OR THAT THEY'D WANT TO 
BUT IN THE YEARS AHEAD THIS SINGLE GENERALLY FORGOTTEN PIECE OF LEGISLATION 
WAS GOING TO RESHAPE MODERN BRITAIN 
AS THE WINDING UP OF EMPIRE BEGAN 
ATTLEE'S GOVERNMENT WAS ALSO PUSHING THROUGH RADICAL CHANGES TO BRITISH INDUSTRY 
SMALL SIGNS SPRANG UP ON THE GATES OF EVERY COAL MINE IN BRITAIN 
ANNOUNCING THEY WERE NOW BEING RUN ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE 
MANNY SHINWELL ONE OF THE VETERAN SOCIALISTS IN THE CABINET 
WAS LEADING THE BATTLE TO NATIONALISE THE COAL INDUSTRY 
THE CONSERVATIVE PRESS WAS BITTERLY HOSTILE 
IF SOME OF THE NEWSPAPER PROPRIETORS AND THEIR EDITORS AND THE WRITERS OF LEADING ARTICLES 
AREN'T SATISFIED WITH WHAT THE MINERS ARE DOING 
WE'RE SHORT OF LABOUR LET THEM COME AND DIG SOME COAL THEMSELVES 
FOR LABOUR PEOPLE THE MINERS HAD ALMOST MYTHIC STATUS 
THEY WERE THE HEROES THEY WERE THE PEOPLE ON THE FRONT LINE 
AND THEREFORE TAKING THE MINES UNDER THE OWNERSHIP OF THE PEOPLE 
WAS A DEBT OF HONOUR FOR THE LABOUR PARTY 
FAIR ENOUGH BUT HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY DO IT 
SURELY THERE MUST BE SOME PLAN 
SOME STRATEGY 
CASTING AROUND SHINWELL EVENTUALLY FOUND A SINGLE FLIMSY PIECE OF PAPER 
AND IT WAS IN WELSH 
THERE WAS NO PLAN NO FULL EXPLANATION WRITTEN IN ENGLISH EVEN THOUGH NATIONALISING COAL 
AND STEEL AND THE RAILWAYS WAS AT THE HEART OF LABOUR'S ECONOMIC VISION 
NINETY PER CENT OF THE COUNTRY'S ENERGY WAS PROVIDED BY COAL 
POLITICALLY COAL MEANT POWER 
HERE IS PERHAPS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY EXAMPLE 
THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY FORERUNNER TO THE EUROPEAN UNION WAS TAKING SHAPE 
AT THIS TIME AND THE FRENCH WERE KEEN FOR BRITAIN TO SIGN UP 
THE GOVERNMENT WAS WARY OF COMPROMISING 
ITS OWN INDUSTRIAL POLICY AND ATTLEE EVADED THE QUESTION FOR MONTHS 
WHEN THE FRENCH FINALLY ISSUED AN ULTIMATUM HE WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY 
SO IT WAS LEFT TO THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER HERBERT MORRISON TO RESPOND 
MORRISON HAD BEEN TO THE THEATRE AND HE WAS TRACKED DOWN TO THE IVY RESTAURANT IN LONDON'S COVENT GARDEN 
AND THERE IN A DUSTY BACK ROOM PILED HIGH WITH CHAIRS FOREIGN OFFICE OFFICIALS TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO HIM 
THE FRENCH PLAN THAT WOULD LEAD ONE DAY TO THE EUROPEAN UNION 
AND MORRISON THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT 
AND THEN HE BRUSHED ASIDE BRITAIN'S BEST CHANCE OF PLOTTING EUROPE'S MODERN FUTURE WITH THE WORDS 
IT'S NO GOOD WE CAN'T DO IT 
THE DURHAM MINERS WOULD NEVER WEAR IT 
AND SO BRITAIN WOULD STAY OUT OF EUROPE FOR ANOTHER GENERATION 
A SNAP OF THE FINGERS DECISION THAT WOULD HAUNT WHITEHALL FOR DECADES 
BUT IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN SOMETHING ARRIVED FROM OUT OF THE BLUE 
WHICH WOULD CONFOUND MINISTERS MINERS AND THE REST OF US 
THERE IS STILL NO BREAK IN THE COLD SPELL 
HEAVY SNOW SHOWERS HAVE AFFECTED RAIL TRAFFIC BLOCKING THEM COMPLETELY 
ON THE TWENTY THIRD JANUARY BRITAIN AWOKE TO WHAT WOULD BECOME THE COLDEST WINTER OF THE CENTURY 
ICY WINDS HEAVY FROST AND QUITE A BIT OF SNOW REAL AUSTERITY WEATHER 
FOR THREE MONTHS THE COAL WAITING BY THE PITS HAD TO STAY THERE FROZEN AND BURIED 
ONE BY ONE THE POWER STATIONS BEGAN TO CLOSE 
WITHIN A WEEK TWO MILLION PEOPLE HAD BEEN LAID OFF 
NEW JERUSALEM GROUND TO A MISERABLE HALT EVEN THE AMERICANS NOTICED 
ENGLAND TODAY ENGLAND CAUGHT IN THE COLD GRIP OF ECONOMIC CRISIS 
THE SEA FROZEN FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE NINETEEN TWENTY NINE IS SYMBOLIC OF ENGLAND'S EVER PRESENT GLOOM 
HERE WITH COMPRESSED AIR DRILLS PARSNIPS ARE HARVESTED 
AND HERE ON THIS FROZEN ISLAND A LITTLE PIECE OF COAL BECOMES OF GREAT IMPORTANCE 
AS THE CRISIS GREW ATTLEE'S GOVERNMENT WAS DRAWING UP SECRET PLANS 
FOR DEALING WITH MASS STARVATION 
AND HERE ARE THOSE PLANS THEY WERE DECLASSIFIED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT 
AND THEY'VE BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE MOST ALARMING ECONOMIC FILE 
EVER WRITTEN IN POST WAR BRITAIN NOT SURPRISINGLY 
THEY TALK ABOUT GOING FORWARD WITH A FAMINE FOOD PROGRAMME ABOUT THE NEED FOR MILITARY STYLE 
CONSCRIPTION TO WORK THE LAND ABOUT BRINGING FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL TO TAKE IN THE HARVEST 
THERE'S A HANDWRITTEN NOTE HERE BY A SENIOR CIVIL SERVANT WITH THE FILE WHICH SAYS 
THE SITUATION BEING CONSIDERED WAS SO DESPERATE 
THAT ANY DELAY MIGHT EXHAUST THE FEW REMAINING RESOURCES THAT MIGHT HELP US TO SURVIVE 
THE MEDIEVAL THREAT OF FAMINE WAS AVOIDED BUT THE COUNTRY WAS EXHAUSTED 
THIS WASN'T THE END OF LABOUR'S NEW JERUSALEM BUT THE GREAT VISION WAS BADLY KNOCKED ABOUT 
I'M LEANING ON A LAMP MAYBE YOU THINK I LOOK A TRAMP 
THESE WERE BOOM TIMES FOR AN EVER EXPANDING BLACK MARKET 
ILLEGAL STREET DEALERS THESE FAMOUS INFAMOUS SPIVS 
WERE FEEDING BRITAIN'S GROWING URGE TO FORGET THE REGULATIONS AND GET ITS HANDS ON LIFE'S LITTLE TREATS 
I PROMISE YOU THERE'S A WATCH IN EVERY PACKET WHAT ABOUT YOU 
THERE IS NO WHISKY 
YET AGAIN MICHAEL BALCON'S EALING CAPTURES THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THE NATION'S MOOD CHANGES 
ENOUGH OF RATIONING AND TIME FOR SOME OF THE FUN THAT THE SPIVS SEEMED TO OFFER 
I TELL YOU WE'RE NOWHERE NEAR ANY ISLAND 
WHISKY GALORE WAS BASED ON THE TRUE STORY OF A WARTIME SHIP 
FULL OF RATIONED WHISKY WHICH RUNS AGROUND OFF THE HEBRIDES 
AND IS PROMPTLY LOOTED BY THE THIRSTY ISLANDERS 
IN REAL LIFE THE SHIP WAS CALLED THE S. S. POLITICIAN 
HERE IT'S CALLED THE S. S. CABINET MINISTER BUT THE STORY'S PRETTY BLATANT 
ONCE YOU LET PEOPLE TAKE THE LAW INTO THEIR OWN HANDS IT'S ANARCHY 
ANARCHY YES 
WHEN THE AUTHORITIES TRY TO SEIZE THE WHISKY BACK THEY'RE BAMBOOZLED OUTWITTED 
THE PURITANICAL STATE IS BEATEN AT LAST 
IT'S COMPLETELY CLEAR WHICH SIDE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ROOTING FOR 
BRITAIN WAS READY FOR GOOD TIMES WHATEVER THE GOVERNMENT THOUGHT 
SOMETIMES THE REVOLTS WERE STARTED BY THE MOST UNLIKELY PEOPLE 
WHEN A YOUNG FRENCH DESIGNER CALLED CHRISTIAN DIOR UNVEILED HIS NEW LOOK IN THE SPRING SHOWS IN PARIS 
WOMEN WERE DELIGHTED BY THE INVITATION TO TURN THEIR BACKS ON CLOTHING COUPONS 
AND WHITEHALL APPROVED FASHIONS 
THE VOICE OF OFFICIAL BRITAIN WAS INSTANTLY DISMISSIVE 
THE NEW LINE IS CALLED ENVOL OR FLY AWAY ALL VERY CHARMING 
BUT I SHOULD THINK IT WOULD FLY AWAY WITH YOUR MONEY AND YOUR COUPONS 
JUST LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL IN THIS ONE 
A JUNIOR MINISTER AT THE BOARD OF TRADE CALLED HAROLD WILSON 
JOINED IN THE DEBATE HIS WIFE MARY SITTING SILENTLY BY HIS SIDE 
I'M SURE ALL THE LADIES WILL UNDERSTAND THAT THE LONGER YOU HAVE YOUR SKIRTS 
THE FEWER THERE'LL BE OF THEM 
THE BUBBLING REVOLTS BUBBLED FURTHER AS THE GOVERNMENT TRIED TO FORCE 
AN EVER ODDER DIET DOWN RELUCTANT BRITISH GULLETS 
OILY WHALE STEAKS HORSEMEAT EVEN REINDEER 
BUT NOTHING NOTHING WAS WORSE THAN SNOEK 
A SOUTH AFRICAN FISH REPUTED TO HISS LIKE A SNAKE AND BARK LIKE A DOG 
FIRST IMPORTED DURING THE WAR NOW THE GOVERNMENT IMPORTED HUGE QUANTITIES OF THE STUFF 
OFF CAPE TOWN THE FISHING FLEETS ARE BUSY 
LANDING SHOALS OF SNOEK S. N. O. E. K. 
AND WE'LL BE TASTING IT IN TINNED FORM BEFORE VERY LONG 
THEY'RE SAVAGE LOOKING BUT GOOD EATING 
TINNED THEY TRIED TO PERSUADE PEOPLE THAT IT WAS DELICIOUS IN SALADS 
OR SANDWICHES OR PASTIES 
OR EVEN AS SNOEK PIQUANT SERVED WITH SPRING ONIONS AND VINEGAR AND SYRUP 
IN TRUTH SNOEK WAS A VILE DISGUSTING MUSH 
EVENTUALLY THE GOVERNMENT GAVE IN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TINS OF SNOEK WERE SOLD OFF AS FISH BAIT 
OR CAT FOOD 
YOU COULD PUSH THE BRITISH PEOPLE ONLY SO FAR AND SNOEK WAS FURTHER THAN THAT 
AND THERE WAS MORE TROUBLE AHEAD 
THE FINANCIAL TIME BOMB ATTACHED TO THE GOVERNMENT'S HARD WON LOAN FROM WASHINGTON WAS ABOUT TO EXPLODE 
ATTLEE'S CHANCELLOR HUGH DALTON NOW HAD TO SUSPEND THOSE EXCHANGE CONTROLS 
WHICH PREVENTED PEOPLE FROM TAKING MORE THAN FIVE OUT OF THE COUNTRY 
THERE WAS A RUSH TO BUY DOLLARS AND THE POUND TUMBLED A SEVERE BLOW 
TO BRITISH PRIDE AND ONE THAT ALSO MADE IMPORTS EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE 
SO GOOD TIMES WERE YET AGAIN POSTPONED 
THE GOVERNMENT WAS IN CHAOS 
THE CHANCELLOR HUGH DALTON WAS SEEN CHARGING AROUND WESTMINSTER HIGH ON BENZEDRINE 
AND COVERED IN BOILS EXCLAIMING WHY CAN'T LIFE GET BETTER 
IT WASN'T AS IF THE GOVERNMENT HADN'T TRIED TO MAKE DRASTIC SAVINGS 
WITH THE ECONOMY IN CRISIS AND THE EMPIRE SHRINKING 
EVEN THE ROYAL NAVY WAS BEING RIPPED APART 
EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY OF ITS WARSHIPS WERE STRUCK OFF THE NAVY LIST 
NOW THIS WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY THING 
ENTIRE FLEETS SHRANK AND THEN THEY VANISHED 
INDIVIDUAL VESSELS WERE BROKEN UP FOR THEIR STEEL 
OR THEY WERE TOWED OUT TO SEA AND USED FOR TARGET PRACTICE AND SUNK 
OR THEY WERE SOLD TO RIVAL NAVIES 
MANY OF THEM WERE MOTHBALLED THAT IS THEY WERE WRAPPED IN PLASTIC AND THEN LEFT TO ROT 
BY NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN THE MIGHTY BRITISH HOME FLEET HAD A SINGLE SERVING BATTLESHIP LEFT 
BRITAIN WAS A COUNTRY WHOSE POWER WHOSE SENSE OF HERSELF HAD COME FROM THE SEA FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS 
THESE WERE DRAMATIC CUTS 
BUT NOT DRAMATIC ENOUGH 
THE NEW BURDENS OF THE COLD WAR WERE STRETCHING THE ECONOMY TO BREAKING POINT 
IN AN ACT OF DESPERATION THE FOREIGN SECRETARY ERNEST BEVIN BROUGHT THINGS TO A HEAD 
HE TOLD THE UNITED STATES THAT BRITISH TROOPS WOULD HAVE TO BE PULLED BACK 
IMMEDIATELY FROM GREECE AND TURKEY WHERE THEY WERE FIGHTING COMMUNISM 
SOVIET TROOPS WERE POISED TO EXTEND THEIR CONTROL TO THE MEDITERRANEAN 
ITALY AND FRANCE WERE SAID TO BE ON THE VERGE OF GOING RED 
NOW AT LAST WASHINGTON BEGAN TO TAKE NOTICE 
THE AMERICANS DEVISED A UNIQUELY GENEROUS PACKAGE OF ECONOMIC AID FOR EUROPE 
IT WAS CALLED THE MARSHALL PLAN AND IT IGNITED THE FASTEST PERIOD OF GROWTH IN EUROPE'S HISTORY 
BRITAIN GOT THE LARGEST SHARE 
JUST LIKE NATO ESTABLISHED SOON AFTERWARDS 
WE WERE TRADING SUCCOUR AND SECURITY FOR NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE 
BUT PERHAPS WE HAD NO CHOICE 
AS ERNEST BEVIN SAID OF THE MARSHALL PLAN IT WAS LIKE A LIFELINE TO SINKING MEN 
THE MINISTER ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THE BRITISH STANDARD OF LIVING 
HAS IMPROVED AND THAT THIS IMPROVEMENT IS DUE PRIMARILY 
TO THE GENEROSITY OF AMERICAN AID THROUGH THE MARSHALL PLAN 
THE AMERICANS HAD SAVED US FROM FINANCIAL DISASTER AT THE LAST MINUTE 
AND ATTLEE'S GOVERNMENT WAS ABLE TO DELIVER ITS MOST ENDURING ACHIEVEMENT 
THE ONE THING IT'S REALLY REMEMBERED FOR 
ON JULY FIFTH THE NEW NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE STARTS 
CHOOSE YOUR DOCTOR NOW 
TODAY WE OFTEN COMPLAIN ABOUT THE STATE OF NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE HOSPITALS 
BUT BEFORE THE N. H. S. THERE WAS A PATCHWORK 
A RAGGED SPRAWL OF PRIVATE CHARITY VOLUNTARY AND COUNCIL RUN HOSPITALS 
IS IT POSSIBLE TO CARRY ON MODERN TREATMENT IN A HOSPITAL LIKE THIS 
WHERE TO REACH THE OPERATING THEATRE A SERIOUS CASE MAY HAVE TO BE 
WHEELED ACROSS A BRIDGE IN HAIL OR IN SNOW 
NOW ATTLEE'S VISION OF JERUSALEM WAS FINALLY ABOUT TO BECOME REAL 
ANEURIN BEVAN ARCHITECT OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE SET OUT 
TO CREATE A SINGLE CENTRALISED BRITISH SYSTEM FREE TO ALL 
BUT IT WOULDN'T BE BUILT WITHOUT A FIGHT 
MANY OF THE DOCTORS WHO WERE AFTER ALL INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONALS 
UNCONNECTED TO THE STATE SAW ALL THIS AS SOCIALIST TYRANNY A POWER GRAB 
AND THAT WAS A PROBLEM BECAUSE NO DOCTORS NO NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE 
THE DOCTORS ORGANISED AN OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT 
WE ALL WANT BETTER HEALTH SERVICES AND BETTER HEALTH 
BUT IN ORGANISING THEM LET'S MAKE SURE THAT YOUR DOCTOR DOESN'T BECOME THE STATE'S DOCTOR 
BEVAN BEGAN BY DIRECTLY ATTACKING THEIR LEADERS AS A SMALL GROUP OF POLITICALLY POISONOUS MEN 
I SEE A SQUALID POLITICAL CONSPIRACY 
BUT THEN HE STARTED TO ACT A LITTLE MORE CLEVERLY DIVIDING AND CAJOLING 
AND IN THE CASE OF THE CONSULTANTS A BIT OF THIS 
AS HE SAID LATER I STUFFED THEIR MOUTHS WITH GOLD 
ON JULY FIFTH NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT HERE AT THE PARK HOSPITAL IN MANCHESTER 
BEVAN PROUDLY UNVEILED THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE 
WE NOW HAVE THE MORAL LEADERSHIP OF THE WORLD HE CRIED 
NOT CRIPPLED BY MODESTY 
ALL OVER BRITAIN MILLIONS SUFFERING FROM HERNIAS CANCERS TOOTHACHE ULCERS 
FLOODED INTO HOSPITALS CHEMISTS AND SURGERIES 
NO LONGER FEARING THE HUMILIATION OF BEING UNABLE TO PAY FOR TREATMENT 
THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CHANGED THE COUNTRY 
THE VERY FIRST N. H. S. PATIENT A YOUNG GIRL CALLED SYLVIA WAS TREATED ROUND THE CORNER 
SHE DID WELL 
AND SHE WAS THE FIRST OF ALL OF US 
IF THERE WAS ONE THING THE BRITISH PEOPLE TOOK FROM THE WAR EXPERIENCE 
IT WAS A HEALTH SERVICE FREE AT THE POINT OF USE 
AND NO GOVERNMENT OF ANY STRIPE HAS DARED TRY AND TAKE IT AWAY FROM US SINCE 
NEW JERUSALEM 
THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE 
BUT THE SURVIVAL OF ATTLEE'S GREATEST TRIUMPH WAS IMMEDIATELY THREATENED 
ON TWENTY FIFTH JUNE NINETEEN FIFTY THE FOREIGN OFFICE BEGAN DECRYPTING THE MOST ALARMING NEWS FROM WASHINGTON SINCE NINETEEN FORTY FIVE 
COMMUNIST NORTH KOREAN FORCES HAD CROSSED INTO SOUTH KOREA IN AN ALL OUT OFFENSIVE 
CHINA'S RED ARMY FOLLOWED 
AT AMERICA'S REQUEST BRITAIN AGREED TO SEND TROOPS MANY OF THEM YOUNG CONSCRIPTS ON NATIONAL SERVICE 
MASSIVELY OUTNUMBERED BRITISH REGIMENTS LIKE THE GLORIOUS GLOUCESTERS 
THREW BACK WAVE AFTER WAVE OF CHINESE ATTACKS 
ON ONE OCCASION THEY WERE SO SHORT OF AMMUNITION THEY WERE REDUCED TO THROWING TINS OF PROCESSED CHEESE 
AT THE COMMUNIST ATTACKERS HOPING THAT THESE WOULD BE MISTAKEN FOR HAND GRENADES 
THINGS ARE GETTING A BIT STICKY HERE THE BRITISH COMMANDER RADIOED BACK 
BUT THE AMERICANS NOT REALISING THIS WAS CLASSIC BRITISH UNDERSTATEMENT FOR WE'RE BEING SLAUGHTERED 
FAILED TO SEND ANY SUPPORT 
OUR ROLE IN KOREA IS TOO OFTEN FORGOTTEN 
THIS WAS THE MOMENT THE COLD WAR WENT HOT 
THE ONLY TIME BRITAIN DIRECTLY FOUGHT A RED ARMY 
BACK AT HOME A MASSIVE INCREASE IN DEFENCE SPENDING DISRUPTED BRITAIN'S 
FRAGILE ECONOMY AND PUNCHED A HOLE IN THE NEW NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE 
SMALL CHARGES FOR DENTISTRY AND SPECTACLES WERE IMPOSED TO SAVE MONEY 
PROVOKING A FURIOUS ROW INSIDE THE GOVERNMENT 
MR. BEVAN WOULD YOU CARE TO SAY A FEW WORDS TO THE NEWSREELS 
IN MANY WAYS THIS WAS A TRIVIAL ARGUMENT THE AMOUNTS OF MONEY INVOLVED WERE VERY SMALL INDEED 
BUT IT WAS ABOUT PRINCIPLE THE AMERICAN ALLIANCE OR THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE GUNS OR BUTTER 
FALSE TEETH OR FIGHTERS 
NYE BEVAN FOLLOWED BY HAROLD WILSON STORMED OUT OF THE GOVERNMENT 
AND THIS WAS THE ORIGIN OF A SPLIT IN THE LABOUR PARTY 
WHICH WOULD CAUSE IT TERRIBLE TROUBLE FOR DECADES TO COME 
IN THE EARLY FIFTIES ATTLEE'S GOVERNMENT WAS BEING DESCRIBED BY ONE JOURNALIST 
AS AN OLD WOUNDED ANIMAL BITING AT ITS OWN INJURIES 
BUT IT STILL HAD ONE FINAL TRICK UP ITS SLEEVE 
THAT ODD NATIONAL PARTY AND MOMENT OF SWAGGER THE FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN 
IT WAS MASTERMINDED BY ATTLEE'S OLD RIVAL HERBERT MORRISON 
THE FESTIVAL COMMITTEE PROMISED THE BRITISH PEOPLE FUN AND FANTASY AND COLOUR 
WHILE SOBERLY SURVEYING OUR GREAT PAST AND OUR PROMISING FUTURE 
THEY SAID WE CAN FOR ONCE LET OURSELVES GO 
FOR THE CONSERVATIVE PAPERS THIS WAS SOCIALIST EXTRAVAGANCE 
THEY CALLED IT MORRISON'S FOLLY 
DON'T MAKE FUN OF THE FESTIVAL DON'T MAKE FUN OF THE FAIR 
WE DOWNTRODDEN BRITISH MUST LEARN TO BE SKITTISH 
AND GIVE AN IMPRESSION OF DEVIL MAY CARE TO THE WIDE WORLD 
IT WAS ALWAYS AN ODD IDEA HERE WERE HIGH MINDED POLITICIANS AND MODERNIST DESIGNERS TRYING 
TO CHEER UP A COUNTRY BY NOW HUNGRY FOR BASIC CONSUMER GOODS 
GRAB THE TRAVELLERS' CHEQUES MY LADS AND PLAY 
STILL OVER EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE THRONGED TO SEE BRITAIN'S BRIGHTER FUTURE 
A WORLD OF SCIENCE AND PROGRESS 
BUT SCRATCH THAT SURFACE AND IT WAS ALL 
JUST A LITTLE BIT DODGY 
THE FESTIVAL PROUDLY SHOW CASED GLEAMING NEW STEAM ENGINES 
THE FRENCH RAIL SYSTEM HAD GONE ELECTRIC A YEAR BEFORE 
WE'VE NEVER BEEN EXACTLY KEEN ON SHOWING OFF OR 
AND THEN THERE WAS THE SKYLON 
AN IMPRESSIVE PIECE OF FUTURISTIC ENGINEERING WITH NO PARTICULAR PURPOSE 
SUSPENDED WITHOUT VISIBLE MEANS OF SUPPORT PEOPLE SAID 
NOT UNLIKE THE BRITISH ECONOMY ITSELF 
WE'LL PAY FOR THE FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN 
PEOPLE DID ENJOY THE FESTIVAL BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE LABOUR'S GOODBYE TO THE COUNTRY FOR A VERY LONG TIME 
WE HAVE BUT TO CASTAWAY BY AN EFFORT OF WILL 
THE ENFEEBLING TENDENCIES OF SOCIALISM 
AND THEN TO STAND ERECT ONCE MORE 
AND TAKE OUR PLACE AMONG THE GREAT POWERS OF THE WORLD 
ATTLEE'S VISION OF A NEW JERUSALEM WAS FINALLY REJECTED AT THE POLLS IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE 
AND REPLACED BY WINSTON CHURCHILL AND HIS GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL NOSTALGIA 
DESPITE LABOUR'S REFORMING ZEAL 
MANY OF BRITAIN'S OLD HIERARCHIES AND TRADITIONS REMAINED ENTIRELY INTACT 
THE DEBUTANTES CONTINUED TO BE PRESENTED TO THE QUEEN 
THE GRAND GENTLEMEN'S CLUBS WENT ON SERVING THEIR TURTLE SOUP AND VENISON 
AND EVEN THE GREATEST PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD EASILY SURVIVED THE SOCIALISTS 
BACK AS PRIME MINSTER CHURCHILL RETURNED TO HIS OLD SCHOOL 
WE IN THIS SMALL ISLAND 
HE TOLD THE BOYS HERE AT HARROW NEED TO MAKE A SUPREME EFFORT 
TO KEEP OUR PLACE AND STATUS 
THE PLACE AND STATUS TO WHICH OUR UNDYING GENIUS ENTITLES US 
BUT WHAT WAS THAT PLACE 
ALL OF HIS LIFE CHURCHILL HAD BEEN DOMINATED BY WAR PREPARING FOR WAR FIGHTING WAR 
BUT BY THE MID NINETEEN FIFTIES HE HAD AN ACUTE SENSE OF THE DANGER OF IMMINENT NUCLEAR CONFLAGRATION 
AND HIS LAST PERSONAL CRUSADE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO BRING RUSSIA AND AMERICA BACK ROUND THE NEGOTIATING TABLE 
A FINAL SURPRISE FROM THE OLD MAN 
FOR A SHORT PERIOD WINSTON SPENCER CHURCHILL BECAME THE WORLD'S LEADING PEACENIK 
CRISS CROSSING THE ATLANTIC CHURCHILL SEEMED TO HAVE A GREATER GRASP OF HOW THE ATOM 
BOMB HAD CHANGED THE WORLD THAN ANYONE IN WASHINGTON 
BUT IN THE END THE AMERICANS IGNORED HIS PLEAS FOR TALKS WITH RUSSIA 
HE CAME HOME WITH LITTLE TO SHOW FOR HIS TROUBLE 
WE HAVE NOT ENTIRELY FAILED 
NOTHING COMES BEFORE THE 
TRUE AND LASTING FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN BRITAIN AND THE UNITED STATES 
SO MUCH FOR BRITAIN'S SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH WASHINGTON 
THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR BRITAIN AT THE TOP TABLE ANY MORE 
BUT WE STILL CLUNG TO THE GLORIES OF OUR IMPERIAL PAST 
IN HYDE PARK THEY SALUTE THE NEW QUEEN ELIZABETH 
THE NAME THAT ONCE BEFORE SPELLED GLORY FOR BRITAIN 
THE NEW QUEEN SET ON FIRE CHURCHILL'S ALWAYS HIGHLY COLOURED SENSE OF HISTORY 
ELIZABETH WOULD GO ON TO REIGN FOR DECADES 
AS A CENTRE OF CONTINUITY WHEN EVERYTHING AROUND HER WAS CHANGING 
BUT FOR CHURCHILL SHE WAS THE CHANGE 
AND HER CORONATION REPRESENTED THE END OF THE OLD PURITAN COMMONWEALTH 
OF THE LABOUR YEARS AND THE BEGINNING OF RESTORATION 
RESTORATION OF THE EMPIRE AN AGE OF PAGEANTRY 
A NATIONAL OPTIMISM IN WHICH CHURCHILL COULD WALLOW 
IN PLACE OF ATTLEE'S NEW JERUSALEM CHURCHILL OFFERED THE NEW ELIZABETHAN AGE 
THE NATION REBORN ATTENDED BY GREAT ADVENTURERS 
COMPOSERS SPORTSMEN ARTISTS AND SCIENTISTS 
THE EMPIRE WOULD ARISE IN NEWLY DEMOCRATIC CLOTHES AS THE COMMONWEALTH 
AUSTRALIA AND SOUTH AFRICA WERE MARKETED AS PART OF A GOLDEN FUTURE 
A KIND OF BRITISH CALIFORNIA NOW WITHIN REACH OF A BRIGHT EYED NEW GENERATION 
IT'S EASY EASIER TO TRAVEL NOW I SHALL GO EVERYWHERE 
I SHALL SEE EVERY KIND OF PEOPLE 
HOW THEY LIVE HOW THEY BRING UP THEIR FAMILIES' 
THE CORONATION ALSO KICK STARTED THE PROPER ARRIVAL OF TELEVISION IN BRITAIN 
IT WAS A GREAT PATRIOTIC EVENT LONG LIVE THE QUEEN 
ADVANCE BRITANNIA WELL MAYBE 
BUT TELEVISION WAS ALSO PART OF A NEW CONSUMER REVOLUTION NOT YET PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD 
THESE HIGH BUTTON BOOTS OF GRAN'S WERE ALL RIGHT IN HER DAY 
BUT THEY'RE TOO OLD FASHIONED FOR TODAY'S MODERN WOMAN 
SHE WANTS THE NEWEST THE LATEST THE SMARTEST 
THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS IN A CLEANER TOO 
BRITAIN'S LEADERS STILL HADN'T COME TO TERMS WITH WHAT PEOPLE WANTED MOST 
COMFORT AND PLEASURE TODAY NOT TOMORROW 
BRIGHTER KITCHENS NOT THE BRITISH COMMONWEALTH 
HMM WONDERFUL 
AND HOLLYWOOD EXCITEMENT NOT INCREASINGLY TWEE EALING COMEDIES 
I SAY IS THIS A NORMAL HAZARD OF RAILWAY TRAVEL 
THE MAN WHO'D TRIED TO BUILD OUR BRITISH NATIONAL CINEMA LEFT EALING IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE 
HE PUT UP A MODEST PLAQUE AT THE GATES OF THE STUDIOS 
HERE DURING A QUARTER OF A CENTURY 
MANY FILMS WERE MADE PROJECTING BRITAIN AND THE BRITISH CHARACTER 
I ASK FROM YOU ALL 
FOR SUPPORT THROUGH DIFFICULT YEARS 
FOR THE GREAT ERA 
WHICH IS OPENING BEFORE US 
MODEST CLEMENT ATTLEE ALSO STOOD DOWN THAT YEAR 
ADMITTING HE NO LONGER UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOUNGER PEOPLE WANTED 
LABOUR'S GREATEST LEADER WITHDREW TO THE SHADOWS 
EVEN THE COUNTRY'S INDESTRUCTIBLE SAVIOUR WAS NOW CONFUSED AND TIRED 
HAROLD MACMILLAN VISITED CHURCHILL TOWARDS THE END OF HIS TIME IN DOWNING STREET 
AND HE FOUND HIM SITTING IN BED WITH A GREEN BUDGERIGAR ON HIS HEAD 
DICTATING TO HIS SECRETARY 
AND FROM TIME TO TIME THE LITTLE BIRD WOULD TAKE SIPS OUT OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S WHISKY AND SODA 
HE WAS GETTING READY TO HAND OVER TO A NEW GENERATION AT LAST 
CHURCHILL SAID THAT HE FELT LIKE AN AEROPLANE AT THE END OF ITS JOURNEY 
WITH THE PETROL RUNNING OUT IN SEARCH OF A SAFE LANDING 
MANY PEOPLE IN BRITAIN KNEW JUST HOW HE FELT 
IN THE NEXT PROGRAMME A NEW SPIRIT SWEEPS THE COUNTRY 
SEX SCANDALS A SHAMEFUL GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY 
AND THE STIRRING OF MODERN BRITAIN'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH JAMES BOND
