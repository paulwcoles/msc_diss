THE PREMIERSHIP DECIDER 
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT SAINT HELENS AND 
THE FORM THEY HAVE BEEN IN RECENTLY 
AND THEY REALLY SEEM TO BE REACHING 
A PEAK LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK 
WITH DAMIEN JOHNSON 
IT IS JUST TWO WEEKS SINCE SAINTS 
FANS LAST CELEBRATED THE VICTORY 
OVER WARRINGTON AT THE HALLIWELL 
JONES SAINTS LED FOURTEEN TO TEN AT HALF 
TIME THANKS TO SCORES FROM PAUL 
CLOUGH ADE GARDNER AND HIS 
BREAKAWAY EFFORT FROM FRANCIS MELI 
WARRINGTON HIT BACK IN THE SECOND 
HALF THE HOME SIDE WERE ON 
ULTIMATELY UNDONE BY CLOUGH TWO 
SHORT RANGE SCORES SECURING A THIRTY TO TWENTY TWO 
WIN IT WAS A LOT EASIER FOR DANIEL 
ANDERSSON'S MEN LAST WEEK AGAINST 
WIGAN WIGAN'S DEFENCE WERE NON 
EXISTENT AND SAINTS RAN RIOT SEAN 
LONG OPENED THE SCORING AND THEY 
COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THE LACK OF 
OPPOSITION ESTABLISHING A THIRTY FIVE TO ZERO 
HALF TIME LEAD EMBARRASSING SAID 
WIGAN BOSS BRIAN NOBLE IT GOT 
LITTLE BETTER AFTER THE BREAK LONG 
GOT A HAT TRICK HE CONTRIBUTED TWENTY SEVEN 
POINTS OVER ALL ADE GARDNER'S 
SECOND OF THE DAY SAW SAINTS 
CRASHED THROUGH THE FIFTY MARK WITH 
TWENTY MINUTES TO PLAY LEE GILMOUR 
WRAPPED THINGS UP WITH HIS SIDE'S 
TENTH TRY THE FIFTY POINT MARK 
DANIEL ANDERSON POINTS OUT THEY HAD 
SCORED TWO HUNDRED ONE POINTS IN FOUR GAMES AND 
CONCEDED FIFTY ONE PLAYER WHO HAS 
IMPRESSED IN HIS SEAN LONG HE SAYS 
HE IS ONE OF THE HARDEST WORKING 
TRAINERS HE IS AT THE HUB OF 
EVERYTHING HAPPENING YOU WOULD 
CONCUR 
YES BUT HE IS NOT ON HIS CONCUR OWN KEIRON CUNNINGHAM JAMES ROBY 
LEON PRYCE SHOWED UP THEY CAN 
GRIND A PERFORMANCE OUT THEY HAVE 
A WINNING MENTALITY THEY HAD 
SEASONED PLAYERS WATCH OUT 
EVERYBODY ELSE 
THE TROUBLE IS YOU 
GET THROUGH THEIR FIRST FRONT OF 
THE TAX ATTACK AND THEY HAVE SUCH 
GOOD PLAYERS ON THE BENCH 
THAT IS 
WHERE THEY ARE STRONG WHEN THEY 
HAVE PEOPLE LIKE FA'ASAVALU COMING 
OFF THE BENCH THEY ADD A HUGE 
AMOUNT OF IMPACT L. L. THINK THE 
PEOPLE THAT TURN UP EVERY WEEK 
BRYN HARGREAVES THESE TYPE OF 
PLAYERS THEY TURNED UP AND DO THE 
JOB FOR SAINT HELENS THAT GIVES THE 
STARS THE CHANCE TO SHINE SEAN 
LONG LEON PRYCE THEY ARE VERY 
GOOD TEAM IT IS A GREAT 
ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM AND I THINK 
THEY WILL GO ON A ROLL 
CAN I GIVE 
YOU AN ANORAK STATISTIC ABOUT 
MAURIE FA'ASAVALU HE HAS PAID ONE HUNDRED EIGHT 
GAMES FOR SAINT HELENS HOW MANY HAS 
HE STARTED ONLY SIX ONE HUNDRED TWO TIMES HE 
HAS COME OFF THE BENCH L. THINK 
THAT IS INTERESTING KEIRON 
CUNNINGHAM WILL BE THE MOST ICONIC 
FIGURE HE HAS MADE THREE HUNDRED ONE APPEARANCES 
AND WANT THIRTEEN TROPHIES IN THESE 
PARTS HE IS JUST KNOWN AS KEIRIN 
I AM JUST A LOCAL BOY DONE GOOD L. 
HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN MY ROOTS L. L. HAVE 
BEEN PART OF SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL 
OH IT IS A TRY 
I AM LIVING THE 
DREAM WHAT EVERY KID STARS WHO 
WATCHES RUGBY LEAGUE L. STARTED 
PLAYING WHEN I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD 
I WAS A TOUGH AND GRITTY KIT THAT 
GOT STUCK IN AND DIDN'T CARE WHO HE 
WAS TACKLING KID ALL OF A 
SUDDEN ALL THESE CLUBS WERE 
CHASING ME IT WAS ONLY REALLY 
WIDNES AND SAINT HELENS THAT CAME UP 
WITH THE GOODS THIS PLACE WAS 
WHERE I WANTED TO GO L. WOULD HAVE 
SIGNED FOR A TRACKSUIT THAT IS THE 
FAMOUS PHRASE ANYWAY 
HOW MANY 
FANTASTIC MEMORIES HAVE YOU CREATED 
ON THIS PITCH 
YOU KNOW I HAVE 
BEEN SO I HAVE BEEN PART OF 
SOMETHING THAT IS SPECIAL L. WAS 
THE NEW BREED COMING THROUGH THE 
START OF A NEW ERA OF SAINT HELENS 
RUGBY LEAGUE 
CUNNINGHAM DRIVING 
HIM WHAT A GOOD GAME 
WE HAD SOME 
GREAT PLAYERS THEY CAME THROUGH 
AND GAVE US SOME EXTRA SPACE YOU YOU HAVE A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH 
THE CHALLENGE CUP SAINT HELENS HAVE 
WON IT SIX TIMES IN TWELVE SEASONS FOR FOR ME IT IS THE BIGGEST TROPHY IN THE 
RUGBY LEAGUE SEASON GOING BACK TO 
WEMBLEY GIVES IT THAT AUTHENTICITY 
GIVES IT WHAT IT DESERVES L. WAS 
LUCKY ENOUGH TO PLAY TWICE AT THE 
OLD WEMBLEY STADIUM THAT IS WHAT 
THE CHALLENGE CUP IS ABOUT FOR ME 
THAT FIRST TIME NINETY SIX AGAINST 
BRADFORD YOU SCORED THE TRY WHAT 
DO YOU REMEMBER 
THEY WENT INTO A 
MASSIVE LEAD AND I WAS THINKING 
THIS CAN'T HAPPEN IN MY FIRST FINAL 
I WAS LOOKING TO EVERYBODY THE 
LIKES OF BOBBY GOLDEN THINKING 
SOMEBODY HAS TO DO SOMETHING L. 
CAN'T LOSE THIS THE NEXT MINUTE 
THE 
BOMBS FROM BOBBY CAME RAINING 
THE BOMBS FROM BOBBY CAME RAINING DOWN I JUST SCORED 
IT LOOKS LIKE 
KEIRON CUNNINGHAM WHO FOLLOWED UP 
AT PACE 
I WAS LOOKING ROUND AND 
THE PLAYERS WERE JUMPING IS THIS 
HAPPENING BUT IT WAS REAL THE 
TRIBE WAS ALLOWED AND WE WENT ON 
THAT WAS THE START OF ONE OF THE 
GREATEST FINALS THE TRY WAS 
ALLOWED AND 
LAST YEAR BACK ALLOWED AT THE NEW WEMBLEY AND YOU LIFTING 
THE TROPHY HOW SPECIAL WAS THAT 
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS TO DO 
THAT 
KEIRON CUNNINGHAM LIFTS THE THAT TROPHY ALOFT SAINT HELENS FANS ROARED 
THEIR APPRECIATION 
I HAVE BEEN 
CAPTAINED BY SOME GREAT CAPTAINS L. 
FELT ALMOST LEFT OUT THAT WAS MY 
TIME AND I WAS COMING TO MAKE SURE 
THAT TROPHY WAS GOING TO BE LIFTED 
BY ME LAST YEAR GOING TO MAKE 
SURE 
THE FUTURE BEYOND PLAYING SURE WHAT DO YOU SEE YOURSELF DOING I I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE CHAIRMAN WE ARE 
DECIDING NEXT YEAR THERE IS A ROLE 
AT THE CLUB FOR ME L. WILL STAY IN 
COACHING OR MAYBE STRENGTH 
COMMISSIONING OR SOMETHING ALONG 
THOSE LINES STOP ARE YOU GOING TO 
HAVE A STATUE BUILT IN YOUR IMAGE 
IN SAINT HELENS 
ALONG THOSE LINES 
STOP IT IS IN HONOUR OF ALL THAT 
YOU AND SAINT HELENS HAVE ACHIEVED IT IT IS AMAZING AMAZING TO BE 
IMMORTALISED IN BRONZE IS SOMETHING 
EVERY SINGLE PLAYER PERSON IN LIFE 
DREAMS ABOUT L. AM GOING TO BE 
STUCK THERE LOOKING AT THESE 
PEOPLE FOR EVER AND EVER 
HE REALLY IS AN IMMENSE FIGURE 
THAT WAS PHIL JONES TALKING TO 
KEIRON CUNNINGHAM HE SEEMS BRIAN 
SO LOW KEY 
HE IS NOT FLASH HE IS 
A GREAT BLOKE YOU SPEAK TO HIM OFF 
THE FIELD IF YOU HAVE A 
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM HE IS CALM 
COLLECTED AND KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS 
TO ACHIEVE HE HAS TRANSCENDED A 
LOT OF ERAS OF RUGBY LEAGUE HE HAS 
BEEN THE BEST MAN IN THIS GAME FOR 
A LONG TIME HE HAS LEARNED THE 
DIFFERENT FACETS AS THE GAME HAS 
GOT FASTER SUMMER RUGBY FOOTBALL 
AND THINGS LIKE THAT HE HAS BEEN A 
PROTOTYPE IN PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING 
I'M SURE HIS STATUE WILL END UP 
SCORING TRIES 
JUSTIN YOU PLAYED 
WITH HIM FOR WALES DIDN'T YOU YES YES FANTASTIC TO PLAY WITH ONE OF THE 
GREATEST PLAYERS IN THE MODERN 
ERA I THINK HE IS ONE OF THE 
BEST NINE IN THE WORLD WHEN HE IS 
ON HIS GAME TO BE ABLE TO EVOLVE 
INTO SO MANY DIFFERENT ROLES OF THE 
HOOKER IF YOU THINK OF THE LAST 
TEN OR SO YEARS THAT ROLE HOW IT 
HAS CHANGED HE HAS ADAPTED AND IS 
STILL AT THE TOP OF HIS FIELD L. 
FEEL VERY PRIVILEGED TO HAVE PLAYED 
WITH HIM JUST A CHAMPION DIED OFF 
THE FIELD VERY HUMBLE AND DOWN TO 
EARTH A CHAMPION GUIDE THERE 
ARE NO ISSUES THE TALKING TO THE 
FANS OR SOMEBODY WITH LESS ABILITY 
A CHAMPION DIED 
YOU HAVE DONE 
WELL TO LOSE THAT WELSH ACCENT 
DOWN PITCH SIDE IN AMONGST THE 
PLAYERS IS ROBBIE PAUL WHO HAS 
PLAYED IN SIX CHALLENGE CUP FINALS 
WHAT ARE WARRINGTON GOING TO DO TO 
STOP THE LIKES OF KIERAN CUNNINGHAM 
AND SEAN LONG WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO 
DO TODAY 
THEY HAVE A BIG TASK 
AHEAD OF THEM WE ALL KNOW THAT 
WARRINGTON HAVE TWO OF THE BEST 
HALF BACKS IN THE WORLD OF RUGBY 
LEAGUE MONAGHAN AND LEE BRIERS TO 
STOP ALL HALF BACKS TO KNOW THAT 
THE GAME STARTS AND IS ONE IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE PACK WE HAVE CLASS 
PLAYERS WHO ARE GOING TO LEAD THE 
WARRINGTON PACK THEY WILL NEED TO 
STAY ON TOP OF SAINT HELENS 
OFFENSIVELY THEY NEED TO GET 
FORWARD GET THEIR NOSES DOWN PLAY 
THE BALL QUICKLY DEFENSIVELY THEY 
ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE TO SLOW SAINT 
HELENS DOWN THIS IS WHAT SAINT HELENS 
DO THEY GET YOU ON THE BACK FOOT 
CUNNINGHAM ROBY LEON PRYCE GET 
YOU ON THE BACK FOOT ONCE THEY 
HAVE GOT YOU YOU CAN NEVER STOP 
IF THEY ARE GOING TO DO WELL THEY 
WILL HAVE TO PLAY WELL FROM THE 
MIDDLE OF THE PACK DOMINATE IN THE 
MIDDLE SLOW THEM DOWN PLAY THE 
GAME AT WARRINGTON'S PACE AND GET 
STUCK INTO THEM MONAGHAN AND LEE 
BRIERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PULL 
OUT ALL THE STOPS AND BRING IN A 
FULL BAG OF TRICKS 
IT IS HARD TO 
GAUGE FROM THE STUDIO HOW WARM IS 
IT ON THE PITCH 
IT IS A VERY 
STICKY MUGGY DAY BUT THEY ARE 
VERY GOOD CONDITIONS FOR PLAYING 
RUGBY LEAGUE WE SHOULD SEE SOME 
ATTRACTIVE EXPANSIVE RUGBY BUT I 
HAVE TO SAY THIS THE ATMOSPHERE IS 
EXCITING THE FANS PACKED IN EARLY 
YOU REALLY FEEL IT IS STARTING TO 
PICK UP I'M A LITTLE JEALOUS I AM 
NOT PLAYING 
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU ARE 
GOING TO PUT PECKETT ON FOR EITHER 
SIDE FOR THE HELL OF IT WHAT ABOUT 
WARRINGTON PUT A KIT ON 
THE ONE BRIGHT SPOT FOR WARRINGTON 
IN THEIR DEFEAT AGAINST SAINT HELENS 
WAS THE FORM OF WINNER KEVIN PENNY 
HE COMBINED WITH MATT KING ON THE 
LEFT WING TO BRING IN A WELL TAKEN 
HAT TRICK HIS FINAL TRY WAS 
SPECIAL HE HAS BEEN COMPARED TO 
MARTIN OFFIAH AND THE FORMAL WIDNES 
AND WIGAN LEGEND WOULD HAVE BEEN 
PROUD OF THIS FINISH WARRINGTON 
WERE HEADING TO CARDIFF WITHOUT A 
WIN IN FOUR GAMES AND IT DIDN'T 
LOOK GOOD FOR COACHED PAUL CULLEN 
WHEN HUDDERSFIELD OPENED UP A BIG 
LEAD AT HALF TIME COACH BUT THE 
GAME WAS TO TURN ON TWO INCIDENTS 
AT THE START OF THE SECOND HALF 
JENSEN DROPPED THE BALL THEN 
STUART REARDON GOT WARRINGTON BACK 
INTO THE GAME WITH THE 
CONTROVERSIAL SCORE THE REFEREE 
APPEARED TO CALL THE TACKLE BEFORE 
REARDON TOUCHED DOWN BUT THE TRY 
WAS GIVEN THAT GAVE WARRINGTON THE 
IMPETUS THEY NEEDED FURTHER SCORES 
FROM LEE BRIERS AND TWO FROM ANDY 
BRACEK SET THEM ON COURSE FOR AN 
UNLIKELY VICTORY THE GIANTS GOT 
BACK WITHIN TWO POINTS BUT BRIERS'S 
SECOND TRY SEALED THE COMEBACK THE 
VICTORY WAS JUST WHAT THEY NEEDED 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE SUPER 
LEAGUE TABLE WARRINGTON ARE IN FIFTH 
PLACE SAINT HELENS IN THIRD IT IS 
VERY VERY TIGHT UNDERNEATH LEEDS 
NO RELEGATION THIS YEAR TO WORRY 
ABOUT BUT EVERYBODY THINKING ABOUT 
THE NEW LICENCES THEY ARE TRYING TO 
EARN LETS HEAR FROM PAUL CULLEN 
HE MADE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY APPEARANCES FOR 
WARRINGTON AS A PLAYER NOW HE IS 
THEIR COACH AND HE HAS BEEN TALKING 
TO DAMIEN 
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE HOLD SAINT 
HELENS HAVE OVER WARRINGTON L. 
DON'T IN YOU HAVE BEATEN THEM HERE 
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR IS THAT GENERALLY A 
FACTOR OR IS IT JUST MEDIA TOUR 
TALK 
WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON PLAYING WELL 
IT IS A BIT OF EVERYTHING WE 
SCORED SOME SUPERB POINTS 
UNFORTUNATELY WE KEEP INVITING THEM 
BACK WITH SOME DUMB PENALTIES THEY 
ARE TOO GOOD FOR US TO GIVE THEM 
FREE BALL AND FREE FIELD 
IT WAS A 
TERRIFIC GAME A FEW WEEKS AGO 
YOU LEARN ANYTHING THAT YOU DIDN'T 
KNOW ABOUT SAINT HELENS 
WE KEEP 
TRYING TO RELEARNING THE SAME 
LESSON THAT WHEN THE TO COMPETE 
WITH SAINT HELENS WHEN WE DO GET IN 
FRONT AS WE 
DO ON 
MANY OCCASIONS 
WE 
HAVE GOT 
TO STOP GIVING THEM 
BALL SO ONE UTTER EMOTIONAL 
PENALTIES RATHER THAN TACTICAL 
PENALTIES WHERE MAYBE THE PRESSURE 
OF BEATING SAINT HELENS IN A BIG GAME 
GETS 
TO ONE OR TWO THAT IS TO BE A DECIDING FACTOR TODAY WE 
ARE CONFIDENT WE CAN SCORE POINTS 
AND 
CAN GO 
FULL 
LENGTH AND 
FULL 
WIDTH OF THE FIELD AGAIN AND SCORE 
POINTS A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED 
THAT WE CONCEDED EIGHTEEN POINTS AGAINST 
SAINT HELENS 
IF YOU LOOK FOR MATCH 
WINNERS SUPPOSE YOU DON'T LOOK 
MUCH FURTHER THAN KEVIN PENNY A 
GREAT FINISHER 
HE CAUSED SOME 
GREAT TRIES AGAINST WORLD CLASS 
OPPONENTS SAINT HELENS WILL NOT BE 
FIELDING MANY JUNIOR PLAYERS TODAY 
THEY HAVE INTERNATIONALS RIGHT 
ACROSS THE BOARD WE HAVE GOT TO GO 
THROUGH THEM AGAIN 
THANK YOU FOR FOR YOUR WELCOME 
AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED IF YOU WERE 
LOOKING AT THE TEAM THIS MARTIN 
GLEESON IS OUT PAUL JOHNSON 
REPLACES HIM THAT WILL LET MAKE 
LIFE MORE DIFFICULT 
I THINK SO HE 
IS AN EXCITING PLAYER JOHNSON HAS 
A SOLID PAIR BUT NOT RENOWNED FOR 
HIS SPEED AND ATHLETICISM L. THINK 
THEY NEED TO GLEESON IN TODAY IF 
THEY 
WERE GOING 
TO BE IN WITH A 
CHANCE 
THE PLAYER THEY WERE CHANCE EXPECTED BIG MATCH FROM HIS KEVIN 
PENNY I REMEMBER SEEING HIM LAST 
YEAR WHEN HE WAS NINETEEN 
I THINK HE HAS 
GOT SOME HUGE THINGS IN HIS GAME 
HE HAS CERTAINLY GOT SPEED SPEED 
TO BURN ONE LOOK AT HIS TRY GREAT 
IN AND OUT SWERVE WITH HIS HIPS 
REMINISCENT OF A TRY HE SCORED LAST 
WEEK WE KNOW THEY CAN SCORE TRIES 
THEY NEED TO GET THE BALL IN 
POSITIONS WHERE THEY CAN UTILISE 
THAT SPEED AND SPACE THEY 
CERTAINLY TRY AND DO THAT AT 
WARRINGTON 
HE IS A TALL SLENDER WARRINGTON LAD BUILT FOR SPEED BUT HE HAS 
MUSCLED A PIPIT FROM LAST YEAR HE HE HAS HE HAS PUT ON MORE WEIGHT IN 
THE OFF SEASON HIS SPEED IS HIS 
BIGGEST ASSET MAYBE THEY NEED TO 
GIVE HIM SOME DECENT BALL TODAY 
HOW MUCH PRESSURE AS COACHES YOU 
OBVIOUSLY UNDER PRESSURE EVERY 
WEEKEND HOW MUCH PRESSURE DO YOU 
THINK PAUL CULLEN HAS BEEN UNDER I I DON'T THINK ANY MORE THAN NORMAL 
THE TIGHTNESS OF THE SUPER LEAGUE 
AND THE TIGHTNESS OF THE CHALLENGE 
CUP HAS MADE EVERYONE'S JOB A 
LITTLE BIT 
HARDER THIS YEAR BUT 
AGAIN PART AND PARCEL OF THE JOB 
THE TAKE THE PRESSURE L. THINK WOULD NOT 
FEEL UNDER 
ANY 
PRESSURE THAN HE NORMALLY WOULD BE 
YES 
THEY HAVE 
GONE OUT 
AND BOUGHT 
SOME DECENT PLAYERS AND SPENCER 
MONEY BUT WE ALL HAVE 
AND WILL 
NEED 
RESULTS SO 
HE'S NO DIFFERENT 
FROM ANYBODY ELSE 
WE HAVE GOT A 
VERY 
GOOD POSITION 
FOR HEARING ALL 
THE STADIUM ANNOUNCEMENTS ONE 
COACH WHO KNOWS HE IS DEFINITELY 
NOT GOING TO BE WITH HIS CLUB NEXT 
IS DANIEL ANDERSON THE SAINT HELENS 
COACH GOING HOME TO AUSTRALIA WITH 
HIS FAMILY 
I GUESS YOU ARE IN PRETTY GOOD 
SHAPE AFTER BEATING WIGAN LAST 
WEEK 
IN GOOD SHAPE AND HEALTHY WEEK TOO WE HAVE A COUPLE OF PLAYERS 
BACK PAUL LAWRENCE HAS BEEN IN 
DOUBT ALL WEEK BUT HAS PULLED UP 
WELL AND WILL PLAY TODAY FOR FOR SAVANNAH ALSO INCLUDED 
YES SOME 
BOYS WILL BE PLAYING WITH INJURIES 
BUT IT IS THE NATURE OF THE GAME FA'ASAVALU DO YOU GOING TO HAVE 
THIS FEELING LIKE YOU HAVE GOT 
MOMENTUM 
YOU SEEM 
TO HAVE THIS 
WHOLE DOUBLE WARRINGTON WE'RE WE'RE GOING IN CONFIDENT L. CERTAINLY 
DON'T TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED WE 
RESPECT WARRINGTON THEY ARE VERY 
DANGEROUS TEAM BUT IF WE PLAYED TO 
THE LEVEL WE HAVE BEEN PLAYING IN 
THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS IT IS 
GOING TO 
BE VERY HARD FOR 
WARRINGTON 
WE MENTIONING BEEN A WARRINGTON BIG WAY KIERON CUNNINGHAM HE IS A 
FANTASTIC SERVANT FOR THIS CLUB AND 
HE TURNS IT ON WEEK IN WEEK OUT I I AM BLESSED SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE 
HE HAS PLAYED ONE HUNDRED PLUS GAMES L. 
THINK HE'S A WARRIOR HE IS A 
FANTASTIC PLAYER HE HE IS A GOOD 
BOTTLE OF RED GETTING BETTER WITH 
AGE 
BEST OF LUCK 
THANK YOU AGE THAT IS THE SCENE OUT THERE AT THIS 
GREAT OLD STAND WHAT'S KNOWN AS 
WAS KNOWN AS KNOWSLEY ROAD IS IT 
ANY MORE AS FAR AS WARRINGTON ARE 
CONCERNED THEY HAVE A BIT UPHILL 
STRUGGLE AHEAD OF THEM SEAN LONG 
WE HAVE MENTIONED HIM BRIEFLY 
LET'S 
TALK ABOUT 
HIM IN MORE DETAIL 
JUSTIN THE RANGE OF THINGS THAT HE 
IS ABLE TO DO 
THAT HE IS SO 
GOOD HE HAS ALL THE TRICKS IN HIS 
BACK HE HAS A GOOD SHOT KICKING 
GAME AND A LONG KICKING GAME L. 
THINK HIS BEST ATTRIBUTE IS HIS 
SENSE OF THE GAME HE CAN READ WHAT 
IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO ALL THREE 
PLAYS AHEAD HE CAN PUT HIS PLAYERS 
AROUND THE PARK 
AND HE 
IS A VERY 
INSPIRATIONAL PLAYER HE WILL SAY 
GIVE ME THE BALL I 
WILL GO 
AHEAD 
AND DO IT MYSELF HE HAS A VAST 
ARRAY OF TRICKS UP HIS SLEEVE HE 
HAS A VERY GOOD PARTNER IN CRIME 
HE HAS VAST ARRAY OF HAIRSTYLES 
AS WELL WHAT ABOUT LEE BRIDGES 
HE'S HUGE 
LEE BRIERS 
HE IS 
PROBABLY THE BEST IN THE GAME HE 
WILL KEEP SAINT HELENS AT THEIR END OF 
THE FIELD WHERE THEY ARE LESS 
DANGEROUS HE ALSO HAS THE ABILITY 
TO TAKE THE LINE ON HE HAS GOOD 
SPEED AND 
EVASION AND 
HE WILL LOOK 
TO EXPLOIT THAT HE WILL NEED IS 
FORCED 
WHAT HE IS ABLE TO DO HE FORCED INSPIRES THE PLAYERS AROUND HIM 
YOU CAN SEE HIM THERE HE IS 
STANDING UP AT THE BACK HE IS 
JUMPING AROUND ON HIS FEET GETTING 
EVERYBODY WOUND UP PAUL CURRAN 
GIVING HIS FINAL WORDS OF 
ENCOURAGEMENT AND ADVICE L. WOULD 
THINK EMPHASISING HOW IMPORTANT IT 
IS THAT THEY START WELL THE CROWD 
LIT CROWD REALLY LOOKING FORWARD 
TO THIS ONE DOES THE ONE PLAYER IS BOUND AN 
IMPACT THE 
MAN 
WHO WILL COME OFF THE BENCH OR 
KIERON CUNNINGHAM JAMES ROBY WE WE MENTIONED BEFORE THE GAME SAINT 
HELENS LIKE TO GET IN YOUR FACE 
ROBBIE MENTIONED THAT THEY LIKE TO 
GET IN THE TIGHT SPOT THEY 
NICE AND FLAT AND THEIR BIG 
FORWARDS 
HE IS 
EQUALLY AS 
AS ANY OF THE PACK OF FORWARDS YOU 
CAN RUN OR 
PASS 
HE IS 
A FANTASTIC 
PLAYER AND 
CERTAINLY ONE FOR THE 
FUTURE HE ONE MAN OF STEEL LAST 
YEAR THAT IS A GOOD ACCOLADE HE HE STILL ONLY TWENTY TWO THOSE ARE SOME OF 
THE INDIVIDUALS TO WATCH OUT FOR 
BUT OVERALL WE ARE LOOKING THE 
TEAM PERFORMANCES FOR PLAYERS TO 
GEL TOGETHER BECAUSE WHAT WE WOULD 
HAVE TO SEE IS A VERY HIGH QUALITY 
GAME 
I THINK 
WE'RE GOING TO GET GAME I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET THAT JAMES ROBY MAN OF STEEL 
TWICE HE IS A VERY VERY GOOD 
PLAYER BUT I THINK THE QUALITY AND 
EXPERIENCE RIGHT ACROSS BOTH TEAMS 
WILL LEAD US TO HAVE A GOOD GAME 
TODAY 
KEVIN PENNY ON THE LEFT TODAY LEON PRYCE IN THE CENTRE THE 
PLAYERS ARE READY LET'S JOIN 
JONATHAN DAVIS AND RAY FRENCH TWO OF THE MOST POWERFUL FORWARDS 
LEAD AT THE TEAMS TWO MEN OF THE 
HIGHEST QUALITY FEARED THROUGHOUT 
THE WORLD OF RUGBY LEAGUE TOUGH 
COMPETITORS MORLEY A WINNER WITH 
LEEDS IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE CUNNINGHAM SIX 
CHALLENGER CUP MEDALS ALREADY GOOD 
CROWD PACKING IN HERE GOOD SUPPORT 
FROM BOTH SAINT HELENS AND WARRINGTON THANKS TO THE DISTRIBUTION AND 
GUILE OF PRYCE THE BACK DIVISION 
HAVE ALREADY REGISTERED FORTY SIX TRIES 
CAYLESS CUNNINGHAM AND GRAHAM ARE 
CAPABLE OF ADDING TO THAT HICKS KING AND MONAGHAN WILL BE 
WANTING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE 
CONDITIONS BUT THEIR ATTACKING 
POTENTIAL WILL ONLY BE RELEASED IF 
LEE BRIERS CAN WEAVE HIS MAGIC IN 
MIDFIELD IF HE DOES THEY WILL 
MAKE THEIR PRESENCE FELT UP FRONT 
AND THE EMBERSON BROTHERS HAVE THE 
PACE TO TROUBLE SAINTS ANDERSON 
BROTHERS ROKEBY AND FA'ASAVALU ARE BOTH 
CAPABLE OF TURNING A GAME FOR SAINT 
HELENS ROKEBY THE PITCH IS IN 
SUPERB CONDITION THE REFEREE IS 
READY TO GET THIS FIFTH ROUND OF THE 
CARNEGIE CHALLENGE CUP IN ACTION 
GREAT ANTICIPATION AFTER TWO 
TREMENDOUS BATTLES BETWEEN THESE 
SIDES IN THE SUPER LEAGUE SAINTS 
JUST EDGING OUT WARRINGTON TWICE 
BUT RATHER NARROWLY DIFFICULT JONATHAN TO GUESS THE RESULT 
WELL YOU HAVE GOT TO GO RESULT WITH SAINT HELENS MOST OF THEIR 
PLAYERS ARE BACK FROM INJURY THEIR 
BENCH LOOKS INCREDIBLY STRONG L. 
THINK WE SAY WHAT AN ATTACKING 
SIDE THEY ARE BUT DEFENSIVELY THEY 
ARE SOLID A BIG BLOW FOR WARRINGTON WAS THAT 
PULLING OUT OF MARTIN GLEESON THE 
CENTRE HE HAD PROBLEM WITH A VIRUS 
A GOOD CHASE BY VINNIE VIRUS ANDERSON YOU CAN'T ALLOW THIS MAN 
TO SIT BACK IN THE POCKET YOU HAVE 
TO PUT PRESSURE ON HIM HIS KICKING 
GAME IS SO GOOD L. THINK THAT THE 
WARRINGTON PACK GLEESON AND 
RAUHIHI HAVE TO STAND UP BECAUSE 
SAINT HELENS ARE VERY DOMINANT WARRINGTON IN THEIR AWAY STRIP 
BLACK AND BLUE SAINT HELENS OF 
COURSE IN TRADITIONAL RED AND 
WHITE MARK GLEESON IS THE YOUNGER BROTHER OF MARTIN WHO IS ABSENT TODAY HE IS THE ONE WHO CAN TAKE THIS WARRINGTON PACK FORWARD HE HAS BEEN IN GOOD FORM THIS 
SEASON GARDNER FOURTEEN TRIES IN CUP 
AND LEAGUE THAT SURELY SHOULD HAVE BEEN A 
PENALTY LIFTING HER LEGS UP ABOVE 
THE HORIZONTAL 
THEY WERE CLUMSY 
LIFTING THE LEGS UP 
IT DOESN'T 
MATTER IF IT IS CLUMSY OR AN 
ACCIDENT IT IS A PENALTY IT 
WOULDN'T MATTER IF YOU CAME DOWN 
ON YOUR HEAD WHETHER IT WAS CLUMSY 
OR NOT WOULD IT THAT IS TRUE NOT MUCH GROUND MADE BY SAINT HELENS THERE A GOOD CATCH FROM STUART REARDON NO PROBLEM WITH CATCHING TODAY PERFECT CONDITIONS FOR ROKEBY RUGBY MATT KING WITH A SHAVEN HEAD 
HAVEN'T SEEN THAT THIS SEASON 
FORMER AUSTRALIAN TEST CENTRE GOOD NATURED BOOZE FROM THE CROWD BOUSSES GOOD DRIVING BACK BY BEN WESTWOOD 
AND MORLEY CUNNINGHAM JUST LOOKING 
AT THE OPTIONS TALAU IS IN THE LAST SEASON OF HIS CONTRACT AT KNOWSLEY ROAD WELL LEE PENNY A FORMER 
BASKETBALL PLAYER BUT HE DIDN'T 
EXACTLY LEAP HIGHER THERE 
I THINK 
YOU READ THAT WELL THE KICK WAS A 
OVERCUT SLIGHTLY HE READ THAT 
WELL HE KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON HE 
READS IT WELL REALLY THERE WILL 
BE QUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT HIS 
DEFENSIVE FRAILTIES ADE GARDNER 
HAS RUN A GREAT RUN OF TRIES 
AGAINST WARRINGTON SO THEY WILL 
TARGET THE YOUNG PENNY CHRIS HICKS ANOTHER WIN MAN IN 
SUPERB FORM THIS YEAR WHEN MAN 
WING MAN ON THE FIFTH TATTLE TACKLE THAT 
SEEMS TO BE HIS ACHILLES SUPERBLY SUPERBLY TAKEN WE HAVE GOT DAMIEN DOWN 
THEIR PITCH SIDE 
YES SOME CONCERN 
ABOUT STUART REARDON BUT ALSO A 
WORD ABOUT THE CONDITIONS IT IS 
VERY MUDDY SOME OF THE PLAYERS 
TAKING WATER ON MUGGY 
WARRINGTON BLEW UP AGAINST SAINT 
HELENS A FEW WEEKS AGO AFTER TAKING 
THE LEAD WE WILL SEE HOW THAT 
DEVELOPS 
THERE IS THE SORRY DEVELOPS PICTURE OF STUART REARDON BEING LED 
FROM THE PITCH 
AN ACHILLES PROBLEM 
A BIG BLOW THAT IS AN ACHILLES 
PROBLEM I THINK THAT IS WHAT IT 
LOOKED LIKE BUT YOUNG RILEY IS ON 
AT FULL BACK PENNY LOOKING FOR SUPPORT BUT THE 
LAD DID WELL TO PICK UP AT ALL 
PICKUP THAT BALL CHRIS RILEY 
YOUNG FORMER ACADEMY PLAYER JUST 
TWENTY YEARS OF AGE PREPARING TO COME 
ON FOR STUART REARDON SAINT HELENS THE HOLDERS OF THIS 
CHALLENGE CUP THIRTY TO EIGHT AGAINST THE 
CATALANS DRAGONS AT WEMBLEY LAST 
SEASON DEFUSED A BOMB PAUL CULLEN WAS SAYING BEFORE KICK 
OFF THAT HE HAD TO DENY SAINT HELENS 
THE BALL HE IS DOING THAT SO FAR 
YES HE IS THE KICKING GAME IS O. K. 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOT GOOD FIELD 
POSITION THE IMPORTANT FACTOR IS 
THAT DEFENSIVELY THEY HAVE KEPT 
THE YARDAGE DOWN FOR THE SAINT HELENS 
FORWARD SO HE WILL BE HAPPY WITH 
THAT THEY HAVE TO KEEP FOCUSED IT 
IS LIKE ARM WRESTLING WHEN YOU ARE 
LOSING YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR FOCUS 
THAT IS WHAT WARRINGTON HAVE 
SOMETIMES FELT LIKE 
THEIR PROBLEM 
COULD BE OVERNIGHT LOSS MARTIN 
GLEESON AND NOW STUART REARDON TWO 
VERY EXCITING BACKS OH IT LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL A THIRD 
FROM FRANCIS MELI A BEAUTIFUL 
EFFORT HE IS LOOKING TO SEE IF 
THERE IS AN OBSTRUCTION OR A PUSH 
BUT FRANCIS MELI SEVEN TRIES IN 
THE SUPER LEAGUE THIS SEASON USING 
HIS HEAD PLEASE 
HEADPIECE THERE 
IS NOTHING REALLY ON DOES HE PUSH 
HIM OR NOT MAYBE HE PUSHES HIM BUT HIS EYES 
ON THE BALL I THINK THAT IS JUST 
A CALL FOR THE VIDEO REFEREE MR. 
SMITH IS THE ONLY ONE HE 
DEFINITELY PUSHES HIM BUT HIS EYES 
ARE ON THE BALL 
WITH HIS RIGHT 
HAND 
I THINK IT IS A PENALTY IT HAND IT MIGHT BE 
PENALTY I THINK YOU YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT ALTHOUGH THAT YOUNG 
LADY IS HOLDING THE TRY POSTER UP 
SHE IS OPTIMISTIC WILL SHE BE 
RIGHT BOOS FROM SAINT HELENS FANS CHEERS 
AND APPLAUSE FROM THE WARRINGTON 
SUPPORTERS NOT VERY HAPPY FRANCIS 
MELI IT WAS A GOOD PIECE OF RUGBY 
WASN'T IT 
VERY GOOD BUT I WOULD 
DEFINITELY THINK THAT WOULD YOU 
PUT HICKS AT FULL BACK RATHER THAN 
YOUNG CHRIS RILEY BECAUSE CHRIS 
RILEY IS NOT THE TALLEST OF GUYS 
YOU NEED SOMEBODY WITH A BIT OF 
HEIGHT I WOULD PUT CHRIS HICKS 
INTO FULL BACK PENALTY 
WHAT DO PENALTY YOU THINK 
IT IS A PENALTY 
MONAGHAN TRYING TO MAKE A QUICK 
KICK 
WOULD YOU CHANGE HICKS TO KICK FULL BACK INSTEAD OF RILEY L. JUST 
FEEL THAT RILEY HAS APPEARED AND HE 
IS NOT THE TALLEST GUY LOOK AT THE 
SIZE OF THE TWO WINNERS YOU NEED 
SOMEBODY WITH SOME HEIGHT 
YOU DO 
BUT HICKS IS QUITE DEVASTATING DOWN 
THIS WING WARRINGTON PRESSING HERE NOW SEVEN METRES FROM THIS LINE OH A TERRIFIC PUSH FROM ADRIAN 
MORLEY HE MENTIONED HIS POWER 
BEFORE KICK OFF HE SHRUGS OFF A 
COUPLE OF TACKLERS AND THE SKIPPER 
IS LEADING FROM THE FRONT FOUR TO ZERO TO 
WARRINGTON A LOVELY BREAK GOES THROUGH 
CAYLESS THERE IS THE STEP THERE 
WE ARE INSIDE BALL L. THINK HE RUNS AT GILMOUR WARRINGTON THEN LOOKING TO ADD 
ANOTHER TWO POINTS AND IT IS 
CHRIS HICKS THE POINTS GATHERER 
SIX TO ZERO THANKS TO THAT LAD ADRIAN 
MORLEY CELEBRATING HIS THIRTY FIRST 
BIRTHDAY THAT IS WELLENS THE FULL BACK 
HE'S GOT AND RUNS QUITE OVER HIM 
HE TARGETS THE FULL BACK HE 
SPOTS HIM WELLENS IS A VERY GOOD 
DEFENDER BUT AGAINST RAMPAGING 
PROP IT IS VERY DIFFICULT AND YOU 
HAVE TO GO LOW 
JONATHAN EVERYONE 
ALL WEEK HAS BEEN TALKING UP THE 
HISTORY AND THE STATISTICS ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
NINETEEN HUNDRED WHEN THEY LAST WON THE

PAUL WELLENS 
WHO HAS HAD ANKLE PROBLEMS ALL WEEK 
JUST MISTIMING THAT BALL BUT 
WARRINGTON ARE MOVING IN VERY 
QUICKLY FEROCIOUSLY UP FRONT JAMES GRAHAM ONE OF THE MANY YOUNG 
CONTENDERS FOR THE GREAT BRITAIN 
TRIP TO THE WORLD CUP AT THE END OF 
THIS YEAR 
AGAIN WARRINGTON ARE 
CONTROLLING THE TACKLE THEY ARE NOT GIVING SAINT HELENS ANY 
ROOM TO MOVE IT 
ALSO THERE IS A 
LOT OF PRESSURE ON WHERE THEY ARE 
KICKING FROM SO NOTHING FANCY 
JUST KEEP THE BALL COMPLETE THE 
SET AND GET A GOOD KICK THAT IS 
ALL THEY HAVE TO DO WARRINGTON 
THEY HAVE BEEN A SIDE IN A SUPER 
LEAGUE WHO HAVE MADE LOT OF ERRORS THIS SEASON BUT FEW SO FAR THEY HAVE GOT TO KEEP THEIR 
DISCIPLINE NO PENALTIES AND KEEP 
THE DEFENCE TIGHT NO MISTAKES 
WHATSOEVER SAINT HELENS LOOKING VERY STATIC THEY 
ARE VERY FLAT THEY ARE NOT GETTING 
QUICKLY OF THE BALLS QUICK PLAY 
OF THE BALLS 
HONESTLY I THINK IT 
NEEDS A RUN FROM LEON PRYCE HE 
COMES IN AT NUMBER ONE LIKE AN 
OLD FASHIONED LOOSE FORWARD BUT 
WITH MORE PACE THAT IS A KNOCK ON LOOK WHERE THEY ARE PRESSURE ON SEAN LONG MATT KING COMING IN WELL LOOKING 
AFTER GIDLEY 
A GOOD BACK PLAYER 
GIDLEY AND KING GREAT RUN GOOD TACKLE HE IS A METRE SHORT A COUPLE OF TACKLES REMAINING SHOCKING PASS YET THE FIRST KNOCK ON YET THE FIRST NOT ON DEFINITELY GET A HAND IN GARDNER 
TRY SAVING GREAT DECISION GREAT 
TACKLE GARDNER 
MY APOLOGIES TO 
LOUIS ANDERSON 
GREAT DEFENSIVE 
PLAY BY THE WINGER 
BUT WARRINGTON 
LOOK SO CONFIDENT WHETHER THEY ARE 
DRIVING FORWARD OR MOVING IT FLAT 
RABENI RAUHIHI TOOK THE OFFLOAD 
AND SUCKED IN THREE DEFENDERS IT IS A PENALTY WOULD YOU GO FOR GOAL 
YES I WOULD 
KICK IT GOT TO GOAL KICK IT THERE WE ARE LYING ON TOP 
OF HIM DOESN'T REALLY GET OFF 
PENALTY CONCEDED THERE BY JON 
WILKIN THE REFEREE INDICATED VERY 
EARLY ON HE WANTS QUICK MOVEMENT 
AWAY FROM THE TACKLE CHRIS HICKS ONE THING ABOUT SAINT HELENS THEY 
WILL KEEP THEIR COMPOSURE THEY 
WILL NOT PANIC THAT IS WHAT 
WARRINGTON HAVE TO DO AS WELL 
CAN'T GET ALL EXCITED THROUGH THIS 
SILLY PAST HICKS THEN WITH THE SECOND 
CONVERSION ATTEMPT CAME OVER HERE 
FROM AUSTRALIA QUITE UNHERALDED AT 
THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON BUT HE 
CERTAINLY HAS MADE A NAME FOR 
HIMSELF THERE IS ANOTHER TWO AND 
THE WARRINGTON SCORE MOVES OUT EIGHT TO ZERO HE HAD TO COME IN THE WISE A TWO 
MAN OVERLAP ON THE LEFT 
OTHERWISE PAUL WELLENS LONG AND LOW PICKED 
UP WELL BY MONAGHAN RAUHIHI 
LURKING THERE WHISTLE HAVE ROBBIE 
PAUL ON TOUCHLINE WHAT DO YOU 
THINK OF THIS WARRINGTON SO FAR 
THEY ARE BEING WELL LED BY THEIR 
TWO FRONT RUNNERS THEY HAVE BEEN 
COMPLEMENTED BY THE OTHER TWO 
FORWARDS THE ANDERSTON BROTHERS 
ANDERSON 
THAT IS THE FIRST MISTAKE ANDERSON WHICH WILL GIVE THEM FIELD POSITION 
IT IS A SENSE OF HOW EAGER THESE 
WARRINGTON PLAYERS ARE TO RUN ON TO 
THE BALL 
WE MENTIONED BEFORE THE 
GAME THAT IS THE TEST MATCH SAINT 
HELENS UP FRONT THIS IS NOW A TEST 
FOR WARRINGTON FIRST REAL TEST OF 
THEIR DEFENCE SAINT HELENS TRAILING IN BOTH THEIR 
SUPER LEAGUE CLASHES AGAINST 
WARRINGTON THIS SEASON AND CAME 
BACK IN THE FINAL QUARTER LONG 
TIME REMAINING HERE EIGHT TO ZERO 
FA'ASAVALU HAS JUST ANNOUNCED HE IS 
ON 
THE PITCH TO MR. WEST WOOD HE RECKONS THAT ANDERSON KNOCKED THE BALL OUT 
AGAIN GOOD DEFENCE 
COMING OUT OF THE BLOCKS VERY 
QUICKLY 
WARRINGTON WATCHING PRYCE QUICKLY VERY VERY CAREFULLY SAINT HELENS NOW ON THE ATTACK WILLIE TALAU INVADES GOOD MOVEMENT 
OF THE BALL ACROSS FIELD AT LAST A 
SMILE ON THE SAINT HELENS CROWD BASIS 
WILLIE TALAU 
JUST WATCH THEY HAVE 
BEEN DRAWN INTO THE LEFT HAND SIDE 
THERE IS THE DUMMY A QUICKSTEP AND 
HE GETS OUTSIDE FAR TOO EASY LEE 
BRIERS WILL NOT BE HAPPY WITH THAT 
NICE LITTLE SKIP AND A JUMP FIRST 
YOU JUST CAN'T GIVE HIM TOO MUCH 
SPACE 
A SCORER IN THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND A SPACE TWO THOUSAND SIX CUP FINALS HE RELISHES THE 
CHALLENGE CUP AND I THINK PLAYING 
FOR A NEW CONTRACT WELL WORTH IT 
ON THE FORM SO FAR THIS SEASON 
VERY SOLID 
AND SEAN LONG WITH THE 
CONVERSION HE HAS BEEN PLAGUED 
WITH INJURIES FOR THE LAST SIX 
MONTHS A GOOD SHOT IT GOES IN ON THE NEAR 
SIDE OF THAT FAR UPRIGHT AND SAINT 
HELENS ARE RIGHT BACK BANG IN THIS 
MATCH 
AS THE BALL HAS COME ACROSS MATCH THERE IS THE DUMMY IF WE STOP IT 
THERE THIS IS THE MISMATCH THERE 
IS THE BLAIR HE GIVES INTO MUCH 
SPACE HE PUT THE STEP ON HIM 
PUTS LEE BRIERS 
WILL NOT 
BE HAPPY 
WITH THAT TACKLE FOR SAVANNAH ONE OF THE MANY SAINT 
HELENS PLAYERS WHO WERE INJURED AT 
THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON 
RETURNING TO ACTION NOW 
FA'ASAVALU HE JUST MANAGED TO GET HOLD OF IT 
FRANCIS MELI USING HIS WEIGHT 
AS I 
FRANCIS MELI USING HIS WEIGHT AS I SAID KEEP THEIR COMPOSURE KEEP 
THEIR DISCIPLINE ONE FORWARD PASS 
GET IN FIELD POSITION AND A SCHOOL 
LET'S SEE THE CHARACTER OF THIS 
WARRINGTON SIDE 
DAMIEN AT PITCH 
SIDE 
YES I'M WITH MATT COOPER A SIDE TEAM MAN FOR WARRINGTON WHAT ARE 
YOU SURE YOUR IMPRESSIONS OF THE 
WIND TO START 
AGO THE THEY STARTED 
TO WELL I DON'T THINK THEY 
STARTED TO WELL 
A TERRIFIC EFFORT 
FROM CHRIS FLANNERY THE AUSSIE 
SECOND ROW THEY WHIPPED THE BALL 
TO THE RIGHT THE SPEED OF THEIR 
HANDLING AND SAYINGS ARE IN THE 
LEAD SAINT HELENS PAUL WELLENS COMING INTO THIS 
MOVEMENT SUPERBLY 
LOVELY PLAY 
HELD THE DEFENCE OUT TRY CHRIS FLANNERY FORMER SYDNEY 
ROOSTERS PLAYER AGAIN A LITTLE 
UNFORTUNATE LAST SCENE SEASON 
SUFFERED BROKEN LEG GREAT FINAL 
MEMBER OF THIS SAINT HELENS SIDE 
UTILITY PLAYER PLAYS IN THE PACK 
PLAYS IN THE CENTRE NO PROBLEM NONCHALANTLY RUNS BACK 
IT GREAT PLAY AGAIN THERE IS 
THE DUMMY THERE IS THE PLAYER WHO 
HAS BEEN CAUGHT HE HAS COME IN 
THE OTHER DEFENDER HAS GOT TO COME 
IN MONAGHAN HAS GOT TO COME IN 
JUST PULLED THE DEFENCE IN TWELVE EIGHT TO SAINT HELENS ROW BE APPEARING ON THE PITCH AS A INTERCHANGE FOR CUNNINGHAM ROBY ROBY BRINGING A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THE GAME THAN KIERON CUNNINGHAM THE MOMENTUM WITH SAINT HELENS 
WARRINGTON BACK PEDALLING L. L. DON'T 
THINK I HAVE EVER SEEN BY SOME 
VALUE KICK A BALL BEFORE EVER 
SEEN FA'ASAVALU THEY MAKE TO MISTAKES AND ANOTHER 
TWELVE POINTS TWO MISTAKES YOU HAVE 
JUST GOT TO KEEP YOUR DISCIPLINE 
AND OF COMPOSURE AND YOUR 
COMPOSURE GREAT PLAY OF THE BALL 
BY MORLEY A LITTLE CHIP THROUGH WELLENS HAD 
IT COVERED GOOD RUNNING FROM PAUL 
WELLENS HE HAD IT COVERED ALL THE 
TIME LOVELY KICK OF THE BALL BUT 
WELLENS IS THERE IN THE RIGHT 
POSITION AS HE USUALLY IS SIMON GRIX NUMBER NINETEEN COMING ON 
HE HAS BEEN OUT FOR TWO OR THREE 
MONTHS WITH ANKLE LIGAMENT DAMAGE 
A BIT OF GAMBLE BUT PAUL CULLEN 
QUITE HAPPY I THINK HE HAD 
RESERVE GAME EARLIER THIS WEEK 
ANOTHER REPLACEMENT BEN HARRISON 
YOUNG MAN 
FROM BARROW HARRISON DID WELL FANTASTIC BALL A TREMENDOUS REPLY FROM WARRINGTON NO PROBLEMS WITH 
THE ATTACKING SKILLS OF THIS WOLVES 
SIDE THAT MAN HICKS ADDS ANOTHER IT IS A GREAT BALL COMMITS MELI GOES IN OUT THE BACK DOOR TRY PICKS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT 
CLEVER PIECE OF PLAY FROM PAUL 
JOHNSON HICKS GOOD RESPONSE CARL HICKS ALREADY 
WITH EIGHT POINTS TO HIS CREDIT A 
TRY AND TWO GOALS A LOT OF NOISE FROM BEHIND HIM A 
SUPERB EFFORT HE IS A REALLY CALM 
FOOTBALLER HICKSON IT IS ALL ABOUT CREATING THE SPACE 
THE OFFLOAD IS MAGNIFICENT HE 
COMMITS THREE DEFENDERS TO THE RUN 
THERE WAS NOTHING ON THERE REALLY 
JOHNS AND GOES IN WRITES ONE 
TACKLE MAGNIFICENT OFFLOAD MELI 
IS SUCKED IN HE RIDES ONE TACKLE GOOD RUNNING AGAIN FROM MORLEY ALWAYS DIRECT EXCELLENT NUMBER ONE ADRIAN MORLEY HAS BEEN SUPERB IN THIS FIRST HALF HOUR GOOD KICK KEEPS SAINT HELENS MOVING 
FORWARD THAT WILL SATISFY PAUL 
CULLEN SLOWLY SLOWLY WALKED TO THE 
CERTAINLY THIS WARRINGTON FRONT ROW 
OPERATING VERY VERY WELL IN 
MIDFIELD 
RAUHIHI IS GOING OFF MIDFIELD THOSE TWO PROPS WILL BE CRUCIAL TO 
THE OUTCOME OF THIS GAME WHEN YOU 
LOOK AT THE SAINT HELENS BENCH 
HARGREAVES KLUFT PICKED UP A HAT TRICK OF 
TRIES IN THE LEAGUE GAME OVER AT 
WARRINGTON KLUFT COUGH THEY WILL BE HAPPY WITH THAT CHRIS VERY SENSITIVE BE LET THAT 
BALL JUST ROLL INTO TOUCH 
SENSITIVELY LETTING THAT BALL CERTAINLY A VERY EXPERIENCED SQUAD 
JACK JONATHAN THIS WARRINGTON 
SIDE THESE AUSTRALIANS HAVE PLAYED 
IN THE GRAND FINALS MORLEY IN THE 
FINAL THEY HAVE WILL BE USED TO 
THIS TENSION 
YES BUT THEY HAVE 
JUST GOT KEEP THEIR COMPOSURE GOOD GOOD RUNNING AND GOOD DISTRIBUTION FROM 
NUMBER ELEVEN BENNY ANDERSON A 
VINNIE ANDERSON VINNIE ANDERSON DIDN'T MANAGE TO GET THROUGH BUT A 
KNOCK ON NOWHERE HE SAID BUT MR. 
SILVERWOOD ISN'T CONCERNED THERE IS A GOOD RELATIONSHIP THERE 
BETWEEN THE HOOKER AND THE REFEREE 
THEY CAN BOTH SMILE EVEN THOUGH 
THEY DISAGREE A TERRIFIC RUN FROM FRANCIS MELI 
HE IS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE STONE AND YOU DON'T STOP 
A MAN LIKE THAT TWO OR THREE METRES 
FROM THE LINE HE LOOKED AT THE 
LINE HE KNEW WHERE HE 
WAS GOING 
AND THERE WAS NO STOPPING HIM IT'S 
ALL ACTION HERE YES GREAT TRY UNFORTUNATELY LEE BRIERS GET 
SUCKED IN AND IS CAUGHT OUT A 
LITTLE BIT LOVELY BALL AGAIN IT IT WAS A GAME EFFORT BY CHRIS RILEY 
BUT HE JUST WASN'T BIG ENOUGH TO 
STOP A HUGE WINNER LIKE THIS ONCE ONCE HE HAS THE BALL IN HIS 
HANDS THERE 
IS ONLY 
ONE 
THING HE 
IS GOING TO DO 
RUN STRAIGHT AND RUN OVER THE 
OF THE UN CHRIS RILEY 
UNFORNATE Y. 
OF YOUNG CHRIS 
UNFORTUNATELY OF YOUNG CHRIS RILEY IT HAS BOUNCED IN I DON'T THINK HE 
AIMED FOR THAT BUT HE CERTAINLY 
STRUCK IT WELL FROM THE FLOOR TWO 
MORE POINTS FOR SEAN LONG AND 
SAINTS RACE BACK IN TO THE LEAD AGAIN IT IS THIS GENTLEMAN HERE 
BRIERS HE GOT HELD IN AND THEN THE 
WING AIR IS SUCKED IN IS THAT A 
FORWARD PASS AND NOT REALLY SURE 
ONCE HE 
GETS THE 
BALL IN HIS HANDS 
ONCE HE GETS THE BALL IN HIS HANDS HE REALISES STRAIGHT OVER THE TOP 
OF RILEY EVERYONE EXPECTED THIS TO BE AT A 
HARD FOUGHT GAME BUT WE ARE 
CERTAINLY NOT ONLY GETTING THAT WE 
ARE GETTING SOME EXCELLENT RUNNING A VERY IMPORTANT COUPLE OF MINUTES 
NOW FOR WARRINGTON THEY HAVE GOT 
TO HOLD OUT 
ADRIAN MORLEY THE 
SKIPPER GOING OFF HAVING A REST 
GOOD KICK PINPOINT ACCURACY THERE 
SUDDENLY SEAN LONG BEGINNING TO 
CONTROL MATTERS IN MIDFIELD GREAT GREAT KICKING GAME JUST TWO MINUTES REMAINING IN THIS 
FIRST HALF AND ALREADY FIVE TRIES 
THE INSCRUTABLE DANIEL ANDERSSON 
THERE JUST WEIGHING UP PERHAPS 
CONSIDERING HIS TALK AT HALF TIME THAT WAS DANGEROUS BUT IT PAID OFF WARRINGTON JUST NOT MOVING IN AS 
QUICKLY AS THEY DID IN THAT OPENING 
PERIOD PERHAPS THE HEAT AND IT IS 
HOT BEGINNING TO TELL LITTLE BIT YES VERY MUGGY DOWN THERE WELL THE HOOTER HAS GONE IT IS 
ALL OVER ALMOST ANOTHER TRY THEIR 
FOR SAINT HELENS BUT I AM SURE THAT 
AFTER THOSE EARLY SHOPS AND THAT 
EIGHT ZERO START FOR WARRINGTON THAT 
LAST TRY FROM FRANCIS MELI WOULD AT 
LEAST PUT A SMILE ON ONE OR TWO OF 
THOSE SAINT HELENS PLAYERS JONATHAN 
STILL ANYBODY'S GAME 
AGAIN JUST A 
QUESTION OF CUTTING SAINT HELENS OUT 
THEY ARE TOO GOOD A SIDE TO OFFER 
AN OPPORTUNITY TO THEY HAVE TAKEN 
THEIR OPPORTUNITIES AND THEY ARE IN 
FRONT 
WELL WE HAVE A GAME ON A HANDS 
FRANCIS MELI THOUGHT HE HAD SCORED 
BUT THAT WAS PUSHED TOO FAR 
WARRINGTON WERE FIRST ON THE 
SCOREBOARD ADRIAN MORLEY ON HIS 
THIRTY FIRST BIRTHDAY SAINTS 
CAME STRAIGHT 
THIRTY FIRST BIRTHDAY SAINTS CAME STRAIGHT BACK WILLIE TALAU FORT STREET'S FIRST 
TRY FLANNERY ADDED ANOTHER TWO 
MINUTES LATER AT THIS POINT IT 
LOOKED LIKE THE HOME SIDE MIGHT RUN 
AWAY BUT CHRIS HICKS ON THE END OF 
A BRILLIANT OFFLOAD THE MAN WITH 
THE BIG HAIR PICKED UP THE LONG 
PASS AND MELI WAS IN FIVE TRIES 
AND ONE DISALLOWED A WONDERFUL 
GAME SO FAR 
LET'S HEAR FROM DAMIEN JOHNSON AND 
ROBBIE PAUL WHO HAVE BEEN PITCH 
SIDE SIDE YES AN ABSORBING FORTY MINUTES WHAT 
ARE YOUR IMPRESSIONS 
IT IS VERY 
WARM DOWN HERE IT IS VERY HOT L. 
THINK THE TRIES THAT WERE SCORED 
THEY WERE JUST STARTING TO TIRE 
SEAN LONG WAS DOING THE SMART THING 
HE WAS KICKING THE BALL DEAD AND 
DICTATING THE PACE 
ONE OR TWO 
ERRORS FROM WARRINGTON AND SAINTS 
SEIZED ON THEM 
YES THEY WILL YOU 
CAN'T GIVE SAINTS THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO GET A SNIFF AND COME BACK INTO 
THE GAME YOU MUST PRESS HOME KEEP 
THE SCORE IN FRONT AND KEEP THEIR 
DEFENCE UP 
HOW BIG A LOSS OF 
GLEESON AND REARDON 
THEY ARE BOTH 
INTERNATIONAL CLASS BOTH PLAYED 
INTERNATIONAL FOOTBALL GLEESON IS 
AN AMAZING CENTRE A GREAT WEAPON 
ON THE RIGHT SIDE TO LIZ STUART 
REARDON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME 
EARLY ON IN THE HALF IT MUST BE 
DEVASTATING TO LOSE STUART 
REARDON WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IS 
KEEP PRESSURE AND DEFENCE UP THEY 
NEED TO KEEP PRESSURE ON SEAN LONG 
IN THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES SEAN LONG 
WAS REALLY DICTATING THE PACE THIS 
IS WHAT SAINT HELENS WANT TO DO TO 
MAKE SURE YOU PLAY AT THEIR SPEED 
WARRINGTON ARE ALL PROFESSIONALS 
BUT WILL THAT HOLD THAT SAINT HELENS 
SEEMED TO HAVE ON THEM PLAY ON 
THEIR MINDS IN THE DRESSING ROOM 
POSSIBLY BUT A LOT OF THE 
WARRINGTON OVERSEAS PLAYERS HAVE 
COME NEW TO THE GAME THE 
INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS SO THAT WILL 
NOT KICK PLAY A PART L. AM REALLY 
LOOKING AT THE ENERGY LEVELS CAN 
YOU CAN THEY KEEP UP THEIR 
INTENSITY INTENSITY PAUL CULLEN GOING IN TO URGE MORE 
OF THE SAME LET'S LOOK AT THE 
STATISTICS IT IS A VERY HIGH QUALITY GAME 
HOW MUCH JUSTIN AND BRIAN IS THE 
WEATHER GOING TO BECOME A FACTOR IN 
THE SECOND HALF WITH THE INJURIES 
TO KEEP WARRINGTON PLAYERS THEY 
WILL HAVE TO TAKE MORE OUT OF SOME 
OF THE BIG MEN THAT THEY WOULD WANT 
TO 
THE OUTSIDE BACKS WILL PLAY A TO KEY ROLE WE WILL SEE MORE DUMMY 
HEART'S RUNNING LEE BRIERS CAN 
IMPROVE A HE THE KICKING GAME 
THORINGTON THE TEAM THAT CONTROLS 
THE FOOTBALL FOR LONG PERIODS OF 
TIME ARE LIKELY TO GO ON AND GET 
THE VICTORY 
IT IS EXHAUSTING OUT 
THERE AND A BIT UNFAIR THAT SAINT 
HELENS HAVE SO MANY PLAYERS TO FALL 
BACK ON 
IT IS INTERESTING THAT TWO 
OF THE TRIES FOR SAINT HELENS HAVE 
COME FROM WARRINGTON ERRORS THAT 
IS WHAT YOU CAN'T DO YOU WANT A 
FAIR SHARE OF THE BALL THEY WERE 
DOING REALLY WELL FOR LONG PERIODS 
OF THE GAME MORI MORLEY AND 
RAUHIHI AND THE ANDERSON BROTHERS 
THEY WERE LOOKING DOMINANT ON THE 
FRONT FOOT A COUPLE OF ERRORS AND 
WE SEE WHAT SAINT HELENS ARE REALLY 
GOOD AT THE WARRINGTON TEAM WERE 
SLIGHTLY TIRING AND THEY EXPLOITED 
FRINGES GOOD LINES TO STOP 
DEFENDERS AND OPENED UP HOLES YOU YOU BOTH PREDICTED A HIGH SCORING MATCH 
THE FIRST TRY WAS DISALLOWED THIS 
IS THE ONE THAT WAS DISALLOWED FROM 
FRANCIS MELI I THINK THEY GOT IT RIGHT HE 
THINKS CHIP KICK FOR ME 
UNFORTUNATELY HE GIVES CHRIS RILEY 
A PUSH IN THE BACK IT IS CLEARLY 
THE RIGHT DECISION FROM THE VIDEO 
REFEREE RIGHT GET OUT OF MY WAY 
THAT IS MY PAUL 
HOW CAN YOU PUSH A 
MAN WHEN YOU ARE NOT LOOKING AT HIM 
POSTMARK REFLEXES 
IF HE HAD 
CONTINUED TO RUN HE MIGHT HAVE 
SCORED ANYWAY IF HE HAD JUST KEPT 
HIS HANDS TO HIMSELF HE COULD 
POSSIBLY HAVE SCORED FOR A START 
ADRIAN MORLEY WHEN HE WOKE UP THIS 
MORNING HE WOULD HAVE SAID I 
WOULD LIKE TO SCORE A TRY 
THE WIN 
IS YET TO BE DECIDED GLEESON JUST STICKING HIS NOSE 
THROUGH A NICE FAST PLAY OF THE 
BALL ISOLATION OF WELLENS A BIG 
MAN ON THE SMALLER MAN IS ALWAYS 
GOING TO WIN THE DUMMY HALF 
GETTING OUT DRAWING ONE OF THE 
MARKERS TO THE SIDE IT GIVES 
MORLEY THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A ONE 
ON ONE FANTASTIC TRY BY MORLEY HE HE IS SO STRONG HE COULD TAKE THREE 
MEN WITH HIM 
HE HAS GOT GREAT LEG 
SPEED ONCE THEY ARE PUMPING AWAY 
HE IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO STOP YOU 
NEED TO TAKE A FEW MEMBERS OF THE 
CROWD WITH YOU TO STOP ADRIAN 
MORLEY HE HAD THE BIT BETWEEN HIS 
TEETH 
WARRINGTON COULD HAVE GOT TEETH FURTHER AHEAD WERE IT NOT FOR SOME 
GREAT DEPENDS FOR SAINT HELENS AND 
KEY TO THAT WAS ADE GARDNER GRIT 
THE FENCE 
HIS FIRST GREAT 
DEFENCE PAUL WELLENS PROBABLY 
CALLED FOR THAT BUT HE MADE THE 
DECISION TO BE BOSS WE SEE THE 
NEXT PLAY THEY ARE OUTNUMBERED 
WARRINGTON SHOULD SCORE EVERY DAY 
OF THE WEEK HE GETS HIS HAND OUT 
WHICH STOPS THE PLAYER 
AFTER THAT 
YOU WERE SAYING WHY HAVE THEY 
TAKEN THE KICK WHY DIDN'T THEY GO 
FOR THE LINE 
THAT WAS THE TURNING 
POINT THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
PUT MORE PRESSURE ON SAINT HELENS AND 
DECIDED TO GO FOR THE TWO POINTS 
UP IN THE STUDIO WE PREDICTED THEY 
WERE GOING TO SCORE IF THEY MAY BE 
DECIDED TO TAKE THE TAP TURN THE 
HEAT UP MORE TAKE PETROL OUT OF 
THE TANK BY MAKING THEM DEPEND 
THEY COULD HAVE GOT ANOTHER SCORE 
UP BUT THEY WENT FOR THE GOAL THEY MAY SAINT HELENS LOOK A BIT 
ORDINARY UNTIL SEAN LONG DECIDED TO 
DO SOMETHING SPECIAL 
THE HAVE 
GIVEN HIM FREE FIELD POSITION A 
GREAT BALL OUT THEY HAVE GOT SOME 
GREAT QUALITY RIGHT TO CROSS THEIR 
LINE HE GIVES HIMSELF LITTLE BIT 
TOO MUCH TO DO DOES LEE BRIERS 
THERE ARE THE SAINTS TEAM AND DANNY 
ANDERSON GOING THROUGH HOW MUCH 
CAN YOU SAY AT HALF TIME YOU DO 
NOT WANT TO 
FILL THE 
HEADS WITH TOO 
MUCH SUPPOSE 
THEIR LUNGS ARE 
BURNING AND THEY ARE A BIT WEARY 
EACH COACH IS DIFFERENT A COUPLE 
OF POINTS HERE AND THERE MAY BE 
SOME TECHNICAL TIPS TO SOME 
INDIVIDUALS OTHER PLAYERS 
GENERALLY HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT IS 
GOING ONE NOT SO WELL SOMETIMES 
THEY JUST NEED A BIT REINFORCEMENT FROM THE COACH BUT 
WHEN YOU 
HAVE A 
TEAM FULL 
OF 
PLAYERS 
LIKE SAINT 
HELENS 
THEY KNOW 
WHAT IS WORKING AND WHAT IS NOT 
WORKING I'M SURE HE'S DOES GUIDING 
THEM IN THE REC RIGHT DIRECTION 
WHAT WARRINGTON MUST DO IS NOT 
ALLOWED THEM TO GET MOMENTUM BUT 
THERE WAS THAT TIME WHEN THEY 
SCORED QUICKLY AFTER THE LAST ONE 
MONAHAN HAD TO COME IN AND STOP 
WELLENS OR HE WAS THREATENED BY 
WELLENS IT IS GREAT FIXING BY THE 
SAINT HELENS PLAYERS YOU SEE ANDERSON 
GOING THE OTHER WAY WHICH OPENS UP 
IT IS COMMITMENT BEYOND BELIEF 
WHEN THEY ARE ON THE FRONT FOOT 
THEY ARE DIFFICULT TO DEFEND 
AGAINST 
IT WAS AS IF 
THEY THOUGHT AGAINST THEY NEEDED TO HIT BACK AND THEY DID 
OFTEN YOU SEE WITH SAINT HELENS DID TEAMS THEY GET A SCORE ON THE 
BOARD GREAT PLAY BY JOHNSON HE 
DREW IN THREE DEFENDERS IN A SHORT 
SPACE HE GETS FRANCIS MELI 
INTERESTED AND IT IS A NICE EASY 
RUN FOR PICKS A WELL WORKED TRY BY 
JOHNSON 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE SUCH GOOD JOHNSON CONTROL AND STRONG WRISTS TO FLICK 
OUT LIKE THIS 
IT IS A FLICK OF THE 
WRIST LIKE A SQUASH PLAYER YOU 
HAVE TO GIVE CHRIS HICKS CREDIT FOR 
STAYING NEAR TO THE SIDELINES AND 
PAUL JOHNSON DID THE JOB FOR HIM 
THE LAST FIVE OR TEN MINUTES OF THIS 
HALF AS THE WARRINGTON PLAYERS 
START TO DRAW ON THE BOTTOMS OF 
THEIR PETROL TANKS SAINT HELENS MAKE 
SURE THEY SCORED AND FRANCIS MELI 
WAS THE MAN 
YES HE HAS HAD A GOOD 
GAME THE GOOD THING ABOUT SAINT 
HELENS EACH MAN THAT CARRIES THE 
BALL IS A THREAT TO THE DEFENSIVE 
LINE THAT NOT A FORWARD PASS A LINE A LITTLE SUSPECT ON THE FINAL PASS 
FRANCIS MELI VERY HARD TO STOP 
CLOSE TO THE LINE WHY SAINT HELENS 
ARE SO GOOD THEIR GREAT PASSES OF 
THE FOOTBALL BUT THE CLOSER THEY 
GET TO THE LINE THEY ARE EQUALLY 
THREATENING CARRYING THE BALL AS 
THEY ARE PASSING IT 
WOULD YOU 
FANCY SAINT HELENS TO WIN THIS NOW I I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE 
FACT THAT THEY DO GENERALLY DO 
SECOND HALVES AS WELL AS FIRST 
START THE CHALLENGE FOR WARRINGTON 
IS TO RAISE THEIR INTENSITY LEVEL 
TO THE SAME START AS IN THE FIRST 
HALF 
THEY ONLY HAVE A FOUR POINT HALF LEAD JUSTIN SAYS HE'S BEEN CONFIDENT 
ALSO IN MANCHESTER THIS IS 
HAPPENING TOMORROW 
ONE LAST CHANCE TO CHECK OUT THEIR 
OPPONENTS TO STAMP THEIR AUTHORITY 
AND TO GET THEIR HOME CROWD BEHIND 
THEM BRITAIN'S BEST PARALYMPIANS 
TAKE ON THE WORLD IN MANCHESTER 
ONE FINAL TIME BEFORE BEIJING THE 
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT PARALYMPIC WORLD CUP TOMORROW 
AT FOUR O'CLOCK P. M. ON B. B. C. TWO 
ALSO TOMORROW ALL THE FINALS AT 
THE WORLD CUP ROWING IN MUNICH IF 
YOU PRESS YOUR RED BUTTON FROM 
NINE THIRTY AM YOU CAN SEE LIVE SEVERAL 
RACES THEM HIGHLIGHTS AT THREE O'CLOCK P. M. ON 
B. B. C. TWO LET'S GO TO PITCH SIDE AND 
DAMIAN JOHNSON 
WOULD YOU CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE 
SECOND HALF 
WE NEED TO CARRY ON 
DOING WHAT WE ARE DOING WE JUST 
NEED TO CONTROL LEE BRIERS ADRIAN 
MORLEY IS HAVING A GREAT GAME KEEP 
UP GOOD POSSESSION AND KEEP THE 
BALL AND PLAY SOME GOOD FOOTBALL 
MELI'S TRY WAS IT FORWARD PASS NO 
IT WAS AS TENSE AND TIGHT AS NO EVERYBODY EXPECTED 
YES IT IS A 
LOCAL DERBY L. HOPE WE ARE GOING TO 
GET TO WEMBLEY 
BEST OF LUCK 
CHEERS FIVE TRIES IN THE FIRST HALF 
CONVERSIONS FROM THE TOUCHLINE 
BOTH SIDES LEADING TWICE ENOUGH 
ACTION TO FILL ANY MATCH BUT I AM 
SURE THE HEAT COULD TAKE ITS TOLL 
IN THIS FINAL FORTY MINUTES 
YES IT 
COULD THAT IS WHEN THE BENCH WILL 
BE IMPORTANT L. THINK FIELD 
POSITION IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR 
WARRINGTON 
WE MIGHT WELL SEE MORE WARRINGTON THAN FIVE TRIES ACTUALLY FOR ONE 
SIDE IF ONE SIDE FADES IN THAT 
FINAL TWENTY NO SIGN OF FADING YET 
THOUGH WARRINGTON TRYING TO GET 
BACK IN THIS GAME ONLY TRAILING BY 
FOUR POINTS BUT AS OUR PITCH SIDE 
REPORTERS AND BRIAN NOBLE AND 
JUSTIN WAY INDICATING A BIG ASK 
HERE WERE INDICATING COULDN'T 
GO ON THE OUTSIDE BECAUSE GARDNER 
WAS HANGING BACK VERY CLEVERLY 
WAITING FOR HIM 
BRIERS WILL NOT BE 
HAPPY WITH THAT MELI NO PRESSURE 
TOOK IT EASY 
I THINK WARRINGTON 
SUPPORTERS WOULD PROBABLY LIKE TO 
SEE LEE BRIERS RUNNING A BIT MORE 
BRING SAINT HELENS DEFENDERS ON HIM 
YES HE IS A VERY DANGEROUS RUNNER 
JASON CAYLESS COULD SWITCH BY ROBY 
TO GRAHAM GOOD SWITCH I THINK LEON PRYCE IS A CLASS ACT HASN'T DONE MUCH YET A TEST FOR YOUNG RILEY PENNY TAKES IT 
THEY ARE BOUND TO PEPPER HIM IT WITH HIGH BALLS THAT COULD HAVE 
GONE ANYWHERE HE WAS FORTUNATE TO 
GET AWAY WITH THAT NEVER EVER LET 
THAT RUGBY BALL BOUNCE ESPECIALLY 
WHEN YOU ARE ONLY A YARD FROM THE 
TRY LINE 
I THINK THE SUN IS 
PROBABLY TROUBLING HIM QUITE A BIT 
OF MR. BATT THOUGH MIST ABOUT HARRISON AGAIN CHARGING FORWARD 
WARRINGTON REALLY DO HAVE TO HOLD 
THIS BALL STOP SAINT HELENS FROM 
GETTING IT THAT'S AN EASY KICK TO 
RETRIEVE GARDNER AGAIN GOOD CHASE 
THOUGH MELI GETTING IN A LOT OF EXTRA WORK IN MIDFIELD GOOD COVERING ACROSS FIELD BY PAUL JOHNSON WELL JUDGED PRYCE LOOKED DANGEROUS THEN 
YES A LITTLE CHIP THEY THEN THINK RILEY ALWAYS HAD IT COVERED 
I THINK RIGHTLY THEY NEED TO GET A 
GOOD SET AND A GOOD KICK AND GET SOME FIELD 
POSITION PUT SOME PRESSURE ON SAINT 
HELENS WHAT A PASS HAS HE GOT THAT BALL 
OUT I THINK HE HAS SENSATIONAL 
PASS I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE HAD 
PASSED IT JONATHAN L. THOUGHT HE 
WAS TACKLED 
A GREAT BALL AGAIN 
WONDERFUL EFFORT 
AGAIN THEY HAVE 
GOOD FIELD POSITION GOOD WIDTH 
OUTSIDE OUTSIDE STAY ON HIM WHAT 
A BALL AGAIN WELLENS HAS 
COMPLAINED IT WAS FORWARD JUST A 
LOVELY LONG PASS HE GOES IN THAT 
IS A GREAT BALL AGAIN BUT IS IT 
FORWARD 
POSSIBLE FORWARD PASS BUT FORWARD THE TOUCH JUDGE IS RIGHT ON THE 
SPOT THERE WELLENS LOOKING IN THE 
DIRECTION OF THE TOUCH OF MR. 
SILVERWOOD BUT THE TRY TO CHRIS 
HICKS HAS BEEN GIVEN THE VIDEO 
REFEREE CANNOT ADJUDICATE ON A 
FORWARD PASS 
IT IS A BIT OF GIVE 
AND TAKE ISN'T IT NO OF NO SO ALL SQUARE SAINT 
HELENS EIGHTEEN WARRINGTON EIGHTEEN JUST FIVE 
MINUTES GONE IN THE SECOND HALF 
AND AGAIN YOU KNOW AS THE BALL 
GOES HE IS JUST GOING TO TARGET 
THIS GUY HE GOES HE GOES HE GOES 
ONCE HE TURNS AND GOES IN THAT IS 
A FORWARD PASS BUT 
IT IS 
A 
TRY AND 
IT IS A GREAT BALL 
HICKS DOES WELL 
TO KEEP IN THE FIELD OF PLAY AS AS BRIAN NOBLE SAID HE JUST STAYED ON 
THE TOUCHLINE RUN THE TRAMLINE 
VERY SILLY TO THROW THE BALL IN 
THERE 
WELL HE WAS GOING INTO THERE TOUCH 
I STILL THINK HE WOULD HAVE TOUCH BEEN BETTER TO GO INTO TOUCH THAN 
THROW THE BALL OUT WIDE WHERE 
TALENT CAN PICK IT UP 
WHY THROW 
THE RISKY BALL WHEN YOU HAVE JUST 
SCORED YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO GIVE 
THE BALL OVER TO SAINT HELENS IN THIS 
PART OF THE FIELD BECAUSE THEY ARE 
SO DANGEROUS 
YOU CAN BE A LITTLE 
BIT TOO AMBITIOUS AGAINST SAINT HELENS 
THERE IS A PENALTY THE REFEREE HAD 
CALLED HELD HOLDING DOWN SAINT 
HELENS ARE ELECTED TO RUN THE BALL ROBY GOOD BALL BUT GOOD TACKLE RED WELL READ BY ANDERSEN WELL WRAPPED UP THERE BY MATT KING GREAT CENTRE PLAY BY GIDLEY A KNOCK ON SUPERB TACKLE GOOD 
DEFENCE THEY HAD TO COME IN HE 
LOST CONTROL 
GOOD TACKLE FROM 
BRACEK WOULD YOU HAVE GONE 
FROM FOR GOAL FROM A PENALTY FROM THAT PENALTY 
IF SAINT HELENS LOSE THE GAME PENALTY NOW IT MEANS THEY SHOULD HAVE 
TAKEN THAT KICK THIS IS THE TIME WHEN YOU NEED TWO BIG MEN UP FRONT NOW GOOD RUNNING BY GARDINER JUST COULDN'T QUITE GET AWAY SAINT HELENS GETTING A PENALTY AGAIN 
HOLDING DOWN 
PUTTING THEMSELVES 
UNDER PRESSURE WE HEARD PAUL CULLEN SPEAKING 
BEFORE KICK OFF ABOUT THE PROBLEM 
OF PUTTING HIS SIDE UNDER PRESSURE 
BY GIVING PENALTIES AWAY I THINK HE HAS GOT IT DOWN IN THE 
CORNER A ADE GARDNER GETS THE 
TOUCHDOWN THE TOUCH JUDGE SIGNALS 
A TRY AND ANDERSON HAS A WORD OF 
ADVICE FOR THE ASSISTANT COACH BUT 
SAINT HELENS BACK IN THE LEAD AGAIN 
AND IT ALL CAME FROM THAT PENALTY 
YES AGAIN THE PENALTY THEY ARE 
SUCKED IN GOOD DUMMY RUNNING BY 
THE SAINT HELENS PLAYERS SUPERB BUT 
AGAIN THEY ARE JUST DEFENDING A 
LITTLE BIT TOO TIGHT 
GOOD PASS 
FROM LEON PRYCE JONATHAN 
JUST 
YES LOVELY PASS PRYCE FLOATING THE PASS OUT THERE 
EFFECTIVELY CUTTING THE WARRINGTON 
WING MAN AT KEVIN PRICE KEVIN 
PENNY RATHER SORRY SEAN LONG AGAIN ACTUALLY GAVE UP KICKING THE GOALS 
LAST SEASON JONATHAN BUT HE LOOKS 
AS CONFIDENT AS EVER THIS YEAR 
DOESN'T HE 
YES SOMETIMES IF IT IS 
ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE HE WILL 
TAKE THE KICK IT IS STILL TWENTY TWO TO EIGHTEEN AS THE BALL 
GLIDES ACROSS THE FACE OF THE POST 
JUST WATCH THE DUMMY RUNNING THERE 
ARE TWO DUMMY RUNNERS THERE THERE 
IS THE NEXT DUMMY RUNNER IT JUST 
TIGHTENS ALL THE DEFENCE YOUNG 
PENNY IS CAUGHT HE HAS GIVEN SELF 
TOO MUCH NO MATTER HOW QUICK HE IS 
HE WILL NEVER STOP THAT A DUMMY 
RUN IS VERY EFFECTIVE FOR SAINT HELENS YOU CAN SEE IT HAS BEEN A CLOSE 
GAME HASN'T IT ALL THE WAY 
THROUGH YOU JUST FEEL OF SAINT HELENS 
GET TWO SCORES IN FRONT THAT MIGHT 
JUST BE ENOUGH SO IT IS CRUCIAL 
VERY EARLY IN THE SECOND HALF THAT 
WARRINGTON HIT BACK AGAIN 
I THINK 
THERE IS A GREAT RESULT IN THIS 
WARRINGTON 
PACK THEY 
ARE COMING IN 
THEY ARE MOVING FORWARD THEY ARE 
NOT SHAKING ANY TACKLING SHIRKING PAUL CLOUGH NUMBER TWENTY ONE MOVING UP 
WELL IN THAT CHASE GOOD RUNNING 
FOR A PROP FORWARD WELL IT WAS WELL INTENDED GILMOUR 
READ THAT LIKE BOOK HE WAS 
TRYING TO RELEASE HIS RIGHT ARM 
GILMOUR STAYED THERE WAITING FOR 
THE OFFLOAD WELL THE REFEREE HAD A WORD WITH 
ADRIAN MORLEY JUST AFTER THE LAST 
CONVERSION ATTEMPT ABOUT THE 
PROBLEMS AT THE TACKLE HE ASKS LEE BRIERS IS HE THE 
CAPTAIN WELL HE USED TO BE HE 
ISN'T NOW STILL INTERFERING WHEN THE TACKLE 
HAS BEEN MADE ACCORDING TO THE 
REFEREE 
I'M NOT SURE IF HE IS REFEREE HOLDING ON TO HIM AND YOU WANT TO 
GET A WAY TO GET BACK IN THE 
DEFENSIVE LINE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE 
TO DO THAT 
IT IS A SPLIT SECOND 
YOU CAN BE RIGHT OR WRONG 
HE IS 
NOT PUNCHING HIM HE IS HOLDING ON 
TO HIM HE IS NOT GOING TO PUNCH 
HIM IT WOULD BE STUPIDITY 
HE HAS 
DONE HIM FOR PUNCHING HIS ARM OFF 
YOU HAVE TO GET BACK IN THE 
DEFENSIVE LINE OH YES NOT A HIGH TACKLE ACCORDING TO THE 
REFEREE HE SAID IT WAS AROUND THE 
COLLAR A HOT COLOUR COLLAR FIFTEEN METRES FROM THE WARRINGTON TRY LINE WELL READ WELL PLAYED KEVIN PENNY IS RAISING A WAY HE 
HAS GONE THE FULL LENGTH OF THE 
FIELD RAISING A WAY A 
MAGNIFICENT TRY FROM KEVIN PENNY 
ABSOLUTELY SENSATIONAL SCORE 
WARRINGTON ARE BACK IN BUSINESS 
WHAT A GAME WE HAVE ON OUR HANDS I I THINK THIS BALL BEHIND THE TRY LINE 
SETS IT UP QUICK AWARENESS AND THE 
ABILITY TO PUT THIS GUY IN SPACE 
THERE IS THE KICK O. K. THERE IS THE 
PAST HICKS IS AWAY IT IS A LOT TO 
DO THERE IS THE PAST PASS 
STILL A LOT TO DO JUST ACCELERATES 
PAST MELI A FANTASTIC TRY GREAT 
PLAY HICKS IS A WAY JUST GOT TO 
GET HIS HANDS FREE TOP CLASS WING 
HER ACCELERATES AWAY FROM 
FA'ASAVALU WINNER GREAT TRY 
WINNETH 
WARRINGTON FANS AND WINNETH WARRINGTON HISTORIANS TELL THE 
STORY OF THE LEGENDARY AUSTRALIAN 
WING MAN BRIAN BEVAN WHO SCORED 
FOR THEM FROM BEHIND HIS OWN LINE 
A GREAT TRIER FANTASTIC TRY KEVIN KEVIN PENNY AND CHRIS HICKS AGAIN LOOKING TO 
ADD TO HIS POINTS TALLY TO DATE 
AGAIN THE CONVERSION RIGHT ON THE 
TOUCHLINE IT IS THE BEAUTY THE WARRINGTON 
FANS GO UP IN THE AIR THE PRIMROSE 
AND BLUE FLAGS OF WAVING THEY ARE 
BACK AGAIN IN THIS GAME THANKS TO 
THAT FLAT JUST WATCH THIS DRIVE 
THANKS TO THIS LAD JUST WATCH THIS 
TRIBE 
WHAT A FINISH IN ALT L. TRIBE WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO PLAY WITH THAT 
MAN NOTHING BETTER THAN IN A RUGBY 
THEN WHEN YOU WATCH A WINNER A 
WINNER LIKE THAT 
BUT THE AMBITION 
BEHIND THE POST IN THE WAY THAT 
PAUL WAS MANOEUVRED OUT 
WHEN YOU 
HAVE SOMEONE OF THAT PLACE ON THE 
WING YOU HAVE AN AWARENESS TO TRY 
TO GET THE BALL TO HIM WHAT AN ATMOSPHERE THE WARRINGTON 
FANS ARE SINGING THEY ARE 
DELIRIOUS THE SAINTS FANS ARE 
ROARING THEIR FAVOURITES ON DID WE 
SAY ABOUT SITE HIRING SAEED TIRING 
I THINK THE QUESTION IS NOW TIRING YOU KNOW THAT SAINTS ARE GOING TO 
BE THERE OR THEREABOUTS AT THE END 
BECAUSE THEY ARE A GREAT FOOTBALL 
INSIDE IT IS A QUESTION OF 
BELIEVING FOR WARRINGTON 
FOOTBALLING SIDE FA'ASAVALU IS BACK ON THE PITCH WELL NO ADVANTAGE TACKLE COMPLETE 
SAYS THE REFEREE 
AN OPPORTUNITY 
HERE YEAH LOST IT WHEN HE HIT THE 
FLOOR WELL HE SAID TACKLE WAS 
COMPLETE BECAUSE LEE BRIERS WAS 
SCORING THE REFEREE 
JUDGING THAT THE TACKLE WAS COMPLETING SAINTS ARE DEFENDING DESPERATELY NOW MONAGHAN IS COMING INTO THE GAME AS WELL NOW A GOOD FOOTBALLER THAT IS A PENALTY DO REFEREE JUDGING THAT A HAND WENT INTO THE PLAY OF THE BALL TO INTERFERE A WATER CARRIER WAS RUNNING ON I 
DON'T KNOW IF PAUL CULLEN HAD SAID 
GO FOR GOAL OR NOT THAT IS A KNOCK ON SURELY A HEAVY ONE TWO POINTS HAVE GONE BEGGING THERE 
IT IS ALL ABOUT COMPOSURE NOW IT 
IS A LONG TIME TO GO IN THIS GAME 
IT WAS INTERESTING I'M SURE PAUL 
CULLEN SAID GO FOR THE TWO POINTS 
AND NERVOUS TWENTY MINUTES REMAINING 
FOR PAUL CULLEN HE HAS BEEN HERE 
BEFORE AND SEEMED WARRINGTON 
LEADING SAINT HELENS IN THE FINAL 
QUARTER 
I THINK HE PLAYED THE LAST QUARTER TIME WARRINGTON BEAT THEM AT SAINT 
HELENS ANYWAY 
YOU DID 
YES 
THINK HE PLAYED IN THAT GAME A 
DIFFICULT PLACE TO COME AND WIN A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY AND SAINT HELENS AWAY 
THE OVERLAP WAS A WAY SAINT AWAY HELENS COME AWAY THE OVER UP WAS 
THERE OVER LAP 
YOU WOULD THINK 
WE WERE IN THE LAST TWO MINUTES 
BUT THERE IS A LOT OF TIME TO GO CUNNINGHAM CALLING ON ALL HIS 
FEARS OF CUP RUGBY 
SAINTS WHEN 
THEY GET THE BALL PICK UP THE 
TEMPO SAINTS ELEVEN TIMES THE CHALLENGE CUP 
WINNERS WARRINGTON FIVE TIMES 
YOU HAVE THE FEELING WITH THINGS 
THAT THEY SEEM TO BE ALWAYS IN 
CONTROL THAT FEELING WITH SAINT 
KITTS SAINT KITTS SAINT KITTS THERE WAS NOTHING REALLY DANGEROUS IN THE CAKE ADRIAN MORLEY WILL SURELY GIVE THE 
INSTRUCTIONS JUST HOLD ON TO THE 
BALL DRIVE IT FORWARD THAT IS THE 
MESSAGE COME ON YOU SAINTS 
RINGING AROUND THIS ARENA I DON'T THINK ADRIAN MORLEY WILL 
DEPART THEY WOULD HAVE TO DRAG HIM 
OFF SUPERB PLAY DOWN THE LEFT HAND SIDE THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLE THE PACE 
AT WHICH THESE PLAYERS ARE 
PLAYING ANYBODY'S GAME AT THIS STAGE TERRIFIC EFFORT FROM GIDLEY SEAN LONG JUST TAKING HIS EYE OFF ROBBIE PAUL WHAT DO YOU THINK 
ABOUT THIS SITUATION 
WHAT CAN YOU 
SAY WHAT AN EXCITING GAME THIS IS 
PROBABLY THE MOST DANGEROUS TIME 
FOR WARRINGTON THE NEXT TEN MINUTES 
IF THEY CAN HOLD ON AND GET INTO 
THE LAST TEN MINUTES OF THE GAME 
THEY WILL HAVE SOMETHING TO REALLY 
PLAY FOR BUT THIS COULD BE 
DANGEROUS SAINT HELENS CAN STRIKE AT 
ANY TIME 
DO YOU THINK THAT NOT 
HAVING WON HERE FOR FORTY YEARS IT 
WILL BE BEGINNING TO GO ON THEIR 
MINDS 
NO I THINK THEY HAD A SNIFF MINDS OF IT THEY HAVE A LOT OF PLAYERS 
THAT WILL NOT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED 
WITH ANY OF THAT BEFORE A LOT OF 
OVERSEAS PLAYERS THAT HAVE BEEN 
VERY SUCCESSFUL FOR THEM L. DON'T 
THINK IT WILL PLAY TOO MUCH ON 
THEIR MINDS PAUL WELLENS JUST GETS THERE AND 
FLICKS IT OVER THE DEAD BALL LINE 
THIS IS ALL ABOUT BELIEVING THAT 
YOU CAN WIN IT IS ABOUT THE TOP 
TWO INCHES WHEN YOU GET INTO THE 
LEVEL OF RUGBY THESE BOYS ARE 
PLAYING AT IT IS THE TOP TWO 
INCHES ALL IN 
THE MIND CERTAINLY CERTAINLY THE FANS ON THE TERRACE THEY 
CERTAINLY BELIEVED WARRINGTON CAN 
WIN DO THESE PLAYERS THEY 
CERTAINLY BELIEVE AS FATIGUE KICKS IN YOU HAVE TO RAISE YOUR CONCENTRATION LEVELS HE HAS LOST 
THE BALL I JUST HAD THE FEELING IN THAT FIVE OR SIX 
MINUTES THAT'S THE WARRINGTON PACK 
WAS BEGINNING TO DOMINATE THE STOP 
YES PAUL JOHNSON IS INJURED AS 
WELL 
HE HAS DONE SOMETHING HE HAS WELL GONE OFF JOHNSON HAS DONE 
SOMETHING SERIOUS 
I THINK IT IS 
HIS ANKLE OR HIS KNEE 
HE KNEW 
STRAIGHT AWAY BECAUSE WELLENS 
BEING A SPORTSMAN THAT HE IS 
THE RIGHT KNEE WENT WELLENS JUST 
CALLED OVER THE PHYSIO STRAIGHT 
AWAY FOR THE OPPOSITE PLAYER WILLIE TALAU GOES RACING IN AGAIN 
THE KEY WEEK WITH A GRIN ON HIS 
FACE HAS WON ANOTHER ONE THE 
KIWI SAINTS REP RIGHT BACK WHILE 
WARRINGTON ARE REJIGGING THEIR 
PLAYERS RIP RIGHT BACK THAT IS 
PROFESSIONALISM A LITTLE BLOCK BY GILMOUR THE WARRINGTON DEFENCE SHUFFLED ACROSS AND FOLLOWED LEON PRYCE TERRIFIC MATCH HERE BUT PRESSURE 
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE GETTING TO SEAN 
LONG THE LEAD HAS CHANGED HANDS 
SEVEN TIMES NOW THESE CONVERSIONS AND PENALTY GOALS COULD BE VITAL TWO SPORT SEAN LONG SAINTS 
RECOVER REGAIN THE INITIATIVE AND 
MOVED OUT TWO POINTS FOR SEAN 
LONG 
THAT ALL CAME FROM A TURNOVER LONG JUST WATCH THIS MAN DOES HE HINDER 
THESE TWO DEFENDERS THAT IS WHERE THEY SCORE A WELL WORKED MOVE IT WOULD BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT THE BOY IS 
IN THE STUDIO THINK OF THAT VERY 
CLEVER PLAY BY SAINT HELENS THE 
BOYS IN THE STUDIO GOODNESS ME THERE IS A TRY OH PAUL KEVIN PENNY ARE BUT 
WONDERFUL BUT PAUL CLOUGH WAS ON 
HAND PAUL KEVIN PENNY COMING 
ALONG AT THE RIGHT TIME AFTER THAT 
SENSATIONAL TRY SAINT HELENS REALLY 
ARE IN BUSINESS NOW 
THERE WAS 
NOTHING ON HERE REALLY IT IS A 
KICK ON THE FOURTH TACKLE WHAT IS HE 
TRYING TO DO 
HE WAS HOLDING IT 
WITH ONE ARM AND IT WAS TUCKED 
UNDER THE REST 
YOU JUST CAN'T DO 
THAT IN THAT POSITION UNDER THE 
WRIST 
HE PUTS IT UNDER HIS WRIST WRIST THAT IS VULNERABLE 
YOU CAN'T DO 
THAT THAT HIS INEXPERIENCE BUT BUT JUST LOOK AT CLOUGH THE FORWARD 
THREE TRIES AGAINST WARRINGTON IN 
THE LEAD HERE WITH ANOTHER ONE 
THAT COULD BE VITAL HAVE SAINT HELENS NOW MOVED INTO A WINNING LEAD SEVENTY ONE MINUTES GONE NOT THE MOST DIFFICULT OF KICKS AS 
SEAN ON CONTINUES AS SEAN LONG 
CONTINUES TO PROVE 
RIGHT CYMRU 
TAKES THE BALL GETS UP HE'S HELD 
GET TO THE FLOOR RIGHT HE TAKES 
THE BALL YOU HAVE JUST GOT TO GET 
HOLD OF IT PRIORITY IS POSSESSION 
FROM HERO TO VILLAIN IN TEN MINUTES 
I KNOW IT IS A BIDS BIG ASK TEN 
POINTS IN IT THE CROWD ARE RILING 
HIM NOW AS WELL GREAT TRY GREAT FINISH THEY HAVE 
BEEN ON THE BACK FOOT THANKS TO 
SOME TERRIFIC PLAY FROM WARRINGTON 
BUT SAINTS ARE RAMPANT LEE GILMOUR 
PICKING UP THE BALL AND SHOWING THE 
PACE THAT HE HAD IN HIS OWN OLD 
CENTRE DAYS DANNY ANDERSON THE 
SAINTS COACH CAN HE RELAX AND 
THINK ABOUT THE DRAW ON MONDAY 
NIGHT FOR THE QUARTER FINALS 
AS WE 
SAID IT IS A FOUR GAME WITH 
ANYONE IN IT A GREAT FINISH GOOD 
PACE I THINK INJURIES TO JOHNSON 
HAS MADE A HUGE IMPACT ON THIS GAME 
THAT WAS A GREAT FINISH THOUGH 
AND HE ENJOYED IT 
ONE OF THE GREAT 
ASPECTS OF THIS SAINT HELENS SIDE IS 
THE WAY THEY'D JUST PICK UP A 
CHANCE TWO OR THREE PASSES AND 
BANG IT IS A TRY 
THEY HAVE A FOUR 
POINTS GAME ONE MISTAKE BY PENNY 
THEN A BOUNCING BALL OPPORTUNITY 
AND THEY SCORE SEAN LONG SET TO ADD ANOTHER TWO 
POINTS AND SAINT HELENS NOW WITH JUST 
SIX MINUTES REMAINING MOVE OUT TO 
FORTY TO TWENTY FOUR POINTS WATCH THIS NISH GREAT RUN LEE GILMOUR LEON PRYCE COME INTO THE PLAY HE 
HAS COME IN THE MORE THIS GAME HAS 
GONE ON WAS THAT A FORWARD PASS A A CLOSE CALL 
THREE TRIES IN FIVE 
MINUTES FROM SAINT HELENS WILLIE 
TALAU LOOKING FOR A HAT TRICK JUST JUST FORWARD I HAVE SEEN THEM GIVEN IT 
IS A QUALITY SIDE WHEN YOU CAN JUST 
TURN THE MATCH ON ITS HEAD WHETHER 
IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY OR A MISTAKE 
BY THE OPPOSITION BUT THE PENNY 
INCIDENT WAS THE TURNING POINT AS 
I SAID EARLIER ON TWO SCORES IN 
FRONT FOR SAINTS CRUCIAL A GOOD PASS WARRINGTON ARE NOT 
DONE YET ANOTHER FOUR TO FROM 
WESTWOOD IT MUST SURELY BE TOO 
LATE NEVER SAY NEVER GOOD PLAYER FROM BEN WESTWOOD THE 
WARRINGTON PLAYER OF THE YEAR LAST 
SEASON NO GREAT ROAR FROM THE WARRINGTON 
SUPPORTERS I THINK THEY REALISE 
THAT POSSIBLY TIME HAS RUN OUT YES YES IT IS A LOVELY ANGLE CUTS INSIDE 
CONSOLATION ADRIAN MORLEY WHO HAS WORKED SO 
HARD UP FRONT HAS LED THIS 
WARRINGTON SIDE WELL NO DISGRACE 
WERE ANY OF THESE PLAYERS IT HAS 
BEEN A MARVELLOUS GAME A WONDERFUL 
SPECTACLE AND IT IS NOT OVER YET 
KING WHO HAS THREATENED DANGER ALL 
THE TIME ON THIS LEFT WING THREE SETS REMAINING THEY HAVE GOT 
TO SCORE IN THIS SET 
SOME TIRED 
BODIES IN RED AND WHITE HOLDING OUT THAT WAS A CHANCE FOR HICKS BUT NO SUPPORT MONAGHAN WAS TWO METRES SHORT TEN 
POINTS THE DIFFERENCE 
THEY HAVE 
GOT TO SCORE THIS SET HE IS OVER SENSATIONS HERE 
PRESSURE KICK THIS SENSATIONS SENSATIONS HERE PRESSURE KICK FOR HICKS HE HERE HAS GOT TO KICK THE GOAL OH HE HAS MISSED 
IT HE HAS MISSED IT I THINK HE WAS LITTLE BIT TOO 
HURRIED WITH IT JONATHAN 
YES HE 
RUSH IT AGAIN THERE IS THE LOVELY 
KICK I THOUGHT HICKS GOT INJURED 
THERE ACTUALLY THERE WAS ANOTHER 
SIX HE COMES IN STEPS STEPS 
SEES THE LINE GOOD STRENGTH TRY 
SIMON GRIX REWARDED FOR HIS EFFORTS SIX POINTS THE DIFFERENCE 
WARRINGTON CAN AT LEAST MAKE THE 
DRAW THEY HAVE GOT TO THROW IT 
ABOUT THERE IS NO QUESTION SAINTS 
HAVE GOT TO HANG IN HERE NOW THE 
SECONDS ARE TICKING DOWN LESS THAN 
A MINUTE WHAT MATCH HE HAS LOST THE BALL AGAIN THAT SURELY WILL BE ALL OVER FIFTEEN SECONDS SAINT HELENS WERE JUST 
HOLD THE BALL TO COMPLETE A VICTORY 
IN WHAT HAS BEEN A SENSATIONAL GAME 
SAINT HELENS ARE THE WINNERS FOURTEEN YEARS 
SINCE THEIR LAST DEFEAT HERE FOR 
SAINTS AGAINST WARRINGTON WHAT 
STAGGERING SENSATIONAL GAME THE THE MAN OF THE MATCH COULD HAVE BEEN 
ANYONE MORLEY PLAYED EXCEPTIONALLY 
AND SO DID JOHNSON HICKS TALENT 
BUT FOR ME MY CARNEGIE MAN OF THE 
MATCH HAS GOT TO GO TO SEAN LONG 
NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF HIS KICKING 
HIS DEFENSIVE WORK ON THAT KING AS 
WELL SUPERB GAME OF RUGBY LEAGUE 
WELL THE JINX FOR WARRINGTON 
WOLVES CONTINUES AT THIS GROUND 
BUT SAINTS CONTINUED THEIR MARCH 
FOR THEIR THIRD SUCCESSIVE 
CHALLENGE CUP FINAL CHRIS DICK 
SCORED EIGHTEEN POINTS AND IT WAS ON THE 
LOSING SIDE KEVIN PENNY SCORED A 
MAGNIFICENT TRY AND WAS STILL ON 
THE LOSING SIDE BUT ALL CREDIT TO 
THOSE MEN IN RED AND WHITE THEY 
STUCK IN THEY CAME BACK THE LEAD 
CHANGED HANDS SO MANY TIMES BUT SAINT 
HELENS THE WINNERS FOURTEEN TO THIRTY AND I'M 
SURE DANNY ANDERSON WELL THERE IS 
NO SMILE ON HIS FACE BUT I'M SURE 
THEY WILL BE TONIGHT WHEN 
REFLECTS ON THIS GAME ONE OF 
GREAT GAMES OF CHALLENGE CUP 
HISTORY DAMIEN 
DANNY ANDERSON IS 
WITH ME 
WOULD YOU CONCUR THAT WAS ONE OF 
THE GREAT GAMES IN CHALLENGE CUP 
HISTORY 
IT WAS NOT GREAT FOR THE HISTORY COACHES IT WAS TIGHT AT THE END COACHES DID YOU THINK THEY WOULD SPEAK UP 
YES THEY WERE VERY DANGEROUS TEAM 
WAS IT ALL ABOUT SEIZING ON 
WARRINGTON'S MISTAKES 
WE MADE A 
FEW AS WELL IT SHOWS THE TALENT OF 
BOTH SIDES BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME 
AWFULLY ATTRACTIVE TRIES AND VERY 
CLASSY PLAY FROM INDIVIDUALS WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE 
QUARTER FINALS NOW 
I DON'T WANT 
ANOTHER ONE LIKE THAT L. LOVE THE CROWD HERE SO HOPEFULLY A HOME TIE 
THAT IS 
ALL I CAN ASK OF THE 
THE CARNEGIE MAN OF THE MATCH SEAN 
LONG IS WITH US ANOTHER SAINTS 
WARRINGTON EPIC 
IT ALWAYS IS 
ISN'T IT IT IS ALWAYS ENTERTAINING 
FOOTBALL IF YOU EVER WANT TO WATCH 
A GOOD GAME OF RUGBY LEAGUE COME 
AND WATCH SAINTS AND WARRINGTON 
PLAYERS DEAD ON THEIR FEET AT THE 
END THEY OFTEN ARE AT THE END OF 
SUPER 
LEAGUE GAMES 
BUT THE 
CONDITIONS WERE HORRENDOUS 
YES IT 
STARTED TO GET A BIT WARM WE 
CONTROL THE BALL BIT BETTER THAN 
WARRINGTON DID L. THINK THAT 
WHAT KIND OF GOT US THROUGH BUT WE 
DID DROP OUR GUARD IN THE LAST FIVE 
OR TEN MINUTES A THOUGHT THEY WERE 
GOING TO PIPPA SAT THE POST WHEN WHEN YOU COME TO A 
GAME LIKE 
THAT 
YOU BEGIN TO THINK YOUR NAME 
IS ON 
THE CHALLENGE 
CUP TROPHY AGAIN NO 
NO I NEVER TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED 
IN RUGBY LEAGUE ANYTHING CAN 
HAPPEN 
YOU'RE 
THE CARNEGIE MAN OF HAPPEN THE MATCH HERE IS YOUR CHAMPAGNE 
WILLIE TALAU TWO TRIES FOR YOU IT 
WAS ANOTHER BIG GAME BETWEEN THE 
TWO SIDES 
YES THEY HAVE ALWAYS 
BEEN TIGHT TUSSLES WE WENT RIGHT 
DOWN TO THE WIRE TODAY IT IS 
EXCITING FOR THE FANS 
BE HONEST 
DID YOU THINK THEY WERE CREEPING UP 
ON YOU AT THE END 
YES NAIL BITING 
STUFF THEY ARE A CLASS OUTFIT A 
GOOD ATTACKING SIDE WE JUST HUNG 
IN THERE 
WE SAW SOME TERRIFIC 
TRIES THIS AFTERNOON DIDN'T WE 
YES WITH THE WEATHER WE CAN THROW 
THE BALL ABOUT A BIT IF THE 
WEATHER STAYS LIKE THIS THERE WILL 
BE SOME MORE GOOD GAMES 
DO YOU 
MAYBE BEGIN TO SEE YOUR NAME ON THE 
CHALLENGE CUP AFTER THAT BATTLE 
MAYBE NOT THERE ARE STILL LOT OF 
GOOD TEAMS 
THOUGHTS ON THE 
QUARTER FINALS 
WE WILL JUST TRY QUARTER FINALS AND CONCENTRATE ON THE LEAD THANK THANK YOU YOU WHAT A SENSATIONAL MATCH SEVENTY FOUR IN 
TOTAL THIRTEEN TRIES EXCITEMENT MIGHT 
TO THE END END TO END STUFF THAT 
HAD EVERYTHING DIDN'T IT YES YES FANTASTIC GAME OF RUGBY LEAGUE WE 
HAD DANIEL ANDERSON SAY THERE WERE 
SOME GREAT INDIVIDUAL DISPLAYS FROM 
BOTH TEAMS BUT NOT GREAT FOR THE 
COACHES 
AS THE CROWD STOOD AND COACHES APPLAUDED YOU HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT 
TO WARRINGTON 
EVERYBODY GAVE THEIR 
ALL WARRINGTON CAME BACK FROM 
ADVERSITY TO GET BACK INTO THE GAME 
WHEN JOHNSON GOT THE INJURY THEY 
WERE LOOKING LIKE GOING TWO SCORES 
AHEAD WITH FIFTY MINUTES TO GO SAINTS 
GO THE LENGTH OF THE FIELD AND WE 
THOUGHT IT WAS OVER BECAUSE THEY 
SCORED THEN WARRINGTON MIGHT A 
DIFFERENT SCRIPT IT WAS LIKE 
BASKETBALL THEY WILL BE TIRED BODIES IN THAT 
DRESSING ROOM WHEN YOU HAVE WON 
MATCH LIKE THAT THE EXHAUSTION 
DOESN'T KICK IN UNTIL LATER I I THINK THEY WOULD BE PROUD OF THEIR 
EFFORT THEY SCORED SOME GREAT 
TRIES AT THE SAME TIME WARRINGTON 
RALLIED A COUPLE OF TIMES THEY 
WERE GOOD ENOUGH TO RESIST THEY 
KEPT THEIR COMPOSURE AND STAYED 
FOCUSED ON WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO 
DO THE VICTORY IS WHAT CUP GAMES 
ARE ABOUT IN THE END 
JONATHAN SAID 
WHEN HE HAD TO MAKE THE CHOICE FOR 
MAN OF THE MATCH IT WAS HARD HE 
COULD HAVE PICKED ANY ONE OF TEN 
PLAYERS TO STOP CHRIS HICKS WOULD 
HAVE BEEN A CONTENDER HE SCORED 
TWO TRIES FOR WARRINGTON BOTH WERE 
SET UP BY PAUL JOHNSON FULL CREDIT TO PAUL JOHNSON HE DOES REALLY WELL ON THE SECOND ONE GREAT DISCIPLINE FROM HICKS 
WHETHER YOU THINK IT IS PAUL WOOD 
OR NOT IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNIST 
TRY WHETHER YOU THINK IT IS 
FORWARD OR NOT IT IS DIFFICULT TO 
SUGGEST HOW IT COULD AND PEOPLE 
WOULD BUT SAINT HELENS PROBABLY HAD A 
TRY THAT WOULD BE DEBATABLE 
COULDN'T BE FORWARD GENERALLY GENERALLY SPEAKING THE DECISIONS LEVELLED 
THEMSELVES OUT DIDN'T THEY I I DON'T DISAGREE WE SAW A FANTASTIC 
EFFORT FROM WARRINGTON AT THE END 
THERE ARE A GREAT ATTACKING TEAM 
WARRINGTON BUT SAINTS HAD DONE 
ENOUGH THEY WERE LIKE A SHARK 
FRENZY AT TIMES WHEN WARRINGTON 
GAVE THEM AN AIR OR PENALTY THEY 
RALLIED AND SCORED AN ERROR OR A 
PENALTY ADE GARDNER WAS CALLING 
FOR THIS FOR AGES 
THEY WANT THE BALL AND AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO SCORE BECAUSE THAT 
IS WHAT THEY LOVED DOING 
STRAIGHTENED UP LONG ENOUGH TO HOLD 
KEVIN PENNY OFF NICE FINISH BY 
GARDNER HE HAD A SOLID GAME 
IMPORTANT THAT THEY CARRIED THE 
BALL WELL OUT OF THEIR OWN HALF 
RUGBY LEAGUE IS VERY CRUEL SPORT 
BECAUSE THIS SAINTS CROWD WERE 
SCREAMING AND SHOUTING THERE IS 
ONLY ONE KEVIN PENNY FOR THE 
MISTAKE HE MAKES LATER BUT THIS IS 
THE BEST DRIVE YOU WILL SEE IN 
RUGBY LEAGUE FOR A LONG TIME THE 
BEST TRY 
WARRINGTON NEVER SAY DIE 
AS SOON AS YOU GET KEVIN PENNY YOU 
THINK LONG IS GOING TO GET IN THERE 
I DON'T THINK MANY PEOPLE WOULD 
CATCH KEVIN PENNY IN THAT SITUATION 
EVEN DWAIN CHAMBERS COULDN'T HAVE 
RUN QUICKER 
IT WAS A GREAT DART 
TOWARDS THE STICKS SUPERB PLAY 
FROM THE WARRINGTON TEAM THAT THAT GREAT DODGED HE IS NOT A BIG GUY 
THESE ARE BIG MEN CHARGING HIM DOWN 
HE KEEPS HIS FOCUS AND KEEPS 
HEADING FOR THE LINE 
HE DID A 
GREAT JOB L. THOUGHT 
SEAN LONG SEAN LONG HAD HIM 
THE FANTASTIC TRY THE CRUCIAL MOMENT HAPPENED TRY NOT LONG AFTER THAT PAUL JOHNSON 
WENT OUT WITH A KNEE INJURY AS 
WARRINGTON WERE ABOUT TO SCORE THE 
GUYS WERE WINCING IN THE STUDIO SAINT 
HELENS SCORED FROM THIS 
THEY GOT A 
PENALTY LEON PRYCE HEAVILY 
INVOLVED WILLIE TALAU THAT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN THE AREA JOHNSON WOULD 
HAVE BEEN DEFENDING THEY FOUND 
SOMEBODY IN THAT ROLE THAT NORMALLY 
WOULD NOT DEFEND THERE A NICE PLAY 
BACK ON THE INSIDE A VERY CRUEL 
GAME IF WARRINGTON HAD SCORED 
THEY COULD HAVE WON THE GAME BUT 
SAINT HELENS TOOK THEIR PENALTY TOOK 
THE FIELD POSITION AND GOT THE 
OPPORTUNITY 
IT ALSO UNPREDICTABLE OPPORTUNITY GOING ONE WAY AND THEN THE OTHER 
KEVIN PENNY SCORED THE BEST TRY OF 
ANY US ANY OF US HAD SEEN AND 
THEN THIS HAPPENS THEY HAVE CLOSED THE PLAYERS DOWN 
LEON PRYCE HAS TO MANUFACTURE A KIP 
KEVIN PENNY DOES HIS JOB 
EVERYTHING ASKED OF HIM 
MANUFACTURE KINNOCK YOU HAVE TO CREDIT THE SAINTS 
PLAYERS BECAUSE THEY PICKED UP THE 
SPOILS 
JONATHAN AVIES HAS RUSHED SPOILS DOWN TO JOIN US WHAT WOULD YOU SAY 
TO KEVIN PENNY AT THE END OF THIS 
MATCH HOW DO 
YOU PICK HIM UP WHEN WHEN YOU 
ARE IN THAT POSITION WHY DO YOU CARRY THE BALL IN ONE HAND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GO THE LENGTH YOU 
HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU HOLD THE BALL 
THAT IS IT AS I MENTIONED YOU 
JUST CAN'T GET TWO SCORES AHEAD 
AGAINST SAINTS THEY JUST CAN'T GO 
AND GO AGAIN IT WAS JUST TWO 
MINUTES AT 
TURNAROUND AND THE 
END OF THE MATCH 
I SUSPECT SAINTS 
ARE RELIEVED EIGHT HUNDRED TEN POINT 
TURNAROUND 
KIERAN AFTER A WONDERFUL GAME ONE 
OF THE BEST I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG 
TIME HOW DO YOU AFTER BEING SO 
SUCCESSFUL AND EXPERIENCED SO MUCH 
SUCCESS HOW DO YOU GET YOURSELF UP 
FOR BIG GAMES LIKE THIS HAS TO MARK 
YOU KNOW YOURSELF PLAYING FINALS 
AND WINNING TROPHIES IS THE BIGGEST 
MOTIVATION 
TODAY WE HAVE THIS MOTIVATION AMAZING RECORD AGAINST WARRINGTON 
SIMILAR TO LAST YEAR'S GAME IT 
WENT DOWN TO THE WIRE WE GOT SOME 
GREAT TRIES TOWARDS THE END IT WAS 
GREAT ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE B. B. C. IT 
IS CERTAINLY NOT GOOD FOR THE 
COACHING STAFF 
DANIEL WAS VERY 
RED FACED AFTER THE GAME FIFTEEN 
MINUTES AGO THEY HAD THEIR NOSES 
IN FRONT WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH 
YOUR MIND AS TO MARK YOU HAVE TO 
STAY WITH IT AND BE PATIENT AND TO 
THE PROCESSING 
YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT 
INTO THE LAST THAT IS WHAT YOU 
PRACTICE FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES 
WHEN YOUR BACK IS AGAINST THE WALL 
AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO SCORE AND 
NOT CONCEDE POINTS WE STARTED 
PREMATURELY CELEBRATING AND THE 
NEXT THING IT IS A SIX ACCRA BALL 
GAME AND THE FANS ARE PANICKING WE 
ARE PANICKING SIX MACRO FOUR 
ALSO YOU GOT BACK TO WEMBLEY LAST 
YEAR HOW GOOD WOULD IT BE TO GET 
BACK THERE AGAIN 
AMAZING EVERY 
TIME YOU GET TO A MAJOR FINAL IT IS 
SPECIAL IT IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF 
YOUR CAREER THAT YEAR IT IS ALMOST 
LIKE A DRUG YOU GET ADDICTED TO 
WINNING THINGS WE HAD TO TAKE IT 
ROUND BY ROUND IT IS ALWAYS AT THE 
BACK OF YOUR MIND PLAYING THE BIG 
SHOW 
CONGRATULATIONS BACK TO THE SHOW STUDIO STUDIO KEIRON CUNNINGHAM MAKING A FAIRLY 
GOOD PLAYED FOR THE B. B. C. TO DO THE 
QUARTER FINAL AT ONE POINT IT 
LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO RUN 
AWAY AND WIN EASILY WARRINGTON 
WERE MAKING MISTAKES HE HAS JUST THROWN THE BALL OUT 
THAT WAS WARRINGTON BALL LEE 
GILMOUR ONE ON ONE FIFTY TO FIFTY GREAT 
SKILL TO CATCH THIS ONCE HE IS ON 
THE FLIGHT IT PUTS HIM ON THE 
FRONT FOOT HE FIND THE OPPORTUNITY 
PACKS HIS BEAT AND YOU THINK THE 
GAME IS OVER 
TOTALLY BACKS HIS 
SPEED BUT WARRINGTON CAME BACK AND 
SCORED TWO TRIES BEN WESTWOOD AND 
SIMON RIX SIMON GRIX 
THEY COULD 
EASILY ROLL OVER IN THAT SITUATION 
YOU MIGHT WANT TO REST ON YOUR 
LAURELS AND SAY WE COMPETED FOR SIXTY 
OR SEVENTY MINUTES BUT THEY WANTED TO 
MAKE A GAME OF IT L. THINK THEY 
WILL BE IN THE DRESSING ROOM 
DISAPPOINTED THEY WILL FEEL AS 
THOUGH THEY DID ENOUGH TO WIN A 
COUPLE OF SILLY ERRORS GIFTED SAINT 
HELENS SOME CRIES THEY WILL RUE 
THAT OPPORTUNITY BUT I'M SURE THEY 
WILL WALK AWAY CONFIDENT THEY HAVE 
HAD SOME INDIFFERENT FORM BUT THEY 
WILL BE CONFIDENT AFTER LEADING 
THIS STADIUM AND GETTING CLOSE IT IT MAY TAKE THEM A FEW DAYS TO FEEL 
THAT CONFIDENCE L. SUSPECT THEY ARE FEELING PRETTY SICK 
A FANTASTIC GAME BUT COLD COMFORT 
FOR YOU THEY HAD DONE YOU AGAIN 
WHETHER THEY HAVE DONE SO OR NOT 
YOU HAVE TO OFFER THE HEADLINES TO 
THE QUALITY OF PLAY THE PLAYERS 
WERE SUPERB AS COACH YOU CAN 
ONLY ASK THE PLAYERS TO GIVE 
EVERYTHING THEY HAVE GOT THINGS GO 
OUT OF YOUR CONTROL IN DECISIONS 
THERE WAS MASSIVE EFFORT IN 
DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES 
YOU MUST 
HAVE FELT YOU WERE IN IT UNTIL THE 
DEATH 
OBVIOUSLY THE POSITION WE DEATH HAVE COME BACK AGAINST SAINT HELENS IN 
THE LAST TEN MINUTES IS A TESTAMENT 
TO THE FITNESS LEVELS OF THE 
PLAYERS 
THE TWO SIDE OF KEVIN PLAYERS PENNY A FANTASTIC TRY AND THEN A 
MISTAKE WHICH REVEALS HE IS STILL A 
YOUNG MAN THE CORRECT 
YOUNG MAN THE CORRECT OBSERVATION HE IS A TREMENDOUS TALENT HE JUST 
HAD A FRACTION OF AN EDGE TODAY 
WHEN IT CAME TO THE BIG GAME 
WINNING MENTALITY BUT THAT DOES 
NOT DETRACT FROM WHAT WAS A VERY 
COURAGEOUS AND SKILFUL EFFORT WE WE SAW SOME TERRIFIC OFFLOAD PAUL 
JOHNSON IN PARTICULAR DO YOU HAVE 
TO PLAY IT AND TAKE RISKS 
THEY ARE 
CALCULATED RISKS NOBODY IS GOING 
TO BEAT SAINT HELENS IN GAMES LIKE 
THIS WITH A KICK AND GRIND YOU 
HAVE TO OUTPLAY THEM IT IS A 
WORLD CLASS SAINT HELENS TEAM AND WE 
HAVE SCORED A LOT OF TRIES WE ARE 
BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED THAT WE HAVE 
TAKEN ONE OF THE BEST TEAMS IN THE 
WORLD AT RUGBY LEAGUE ON WE WERE A 
FRACTION OFF 
PEOPLE WILL SAY THAT 
THE SAINTS WHO DO CONTINUES THAT THAT IS FOR THE MEDIA THE SUPPORTERS 
WHOEVER WANTS TO GET INVOLVED YOU 
HAVE TO ADMIRE THE QUALITIES OF THE 
PLAYERS WE HAVE PLAYED OUR PART IN 
WHAT WAS AN ABSOLUTE RUGBY LEAGUE 
CLASSIC 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH CLASSIC JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAR GIVEN THEY 
WERE MISSING MARTIN GLEESON AND 
LOST STUART REARDON AND MARTIN 
GLEESON LATER IT WAS GOOD JON CLARKE NOT AVAILABLE EITHER 
FIRST CHOICE HOOKER A NICE LINE BY 
WESTWOOD HE IS GOOD PLAYER HE 
WAS PLAYER OF THE YEAR LAST YEAR 
HE HAS IMPROVED IMMENSELY AND NICE 
LONG PASS BY GLEESON THEY GOT A 
BIT OF LUCK THERE WITH THE BALL 
BOUNCING BACK INTO THEIR HANDS BUT 
YOU MAKE THE BEST OF YOUR LAP 
UNFORTUNATELY THEY COULDN'T KICK 
THE GOAL IN AND MAKE IT AN EXCITING 
LAST MINUTE 
IT WAS STILL PRETTY 
EXCITING I WAS STARTING TO THINK 
IT IS TEN MINUTES EACH WAY FOR EXTRA 
TIME ISN'T IT 
THAT WAS A GREAT ADVERT FOR THE 
BRITISH GAME 
IT SURE WAS IT WAS 
VERY TIMELY IT WAS A GREAT TIME TO 
GET ON THE NATIONAL TELEVISION AND 
GO RIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY IT WAS 
A REAL TREAT FOR EVERYBODY BOTH 
HERE AND I AM SURE WATCHING ON T. V. 
AS THE COACH DID YOU FEEL SAINTS 
WOULD ALWAYS HAVE THE EDGE WAS IT 
NAIL BITING RIGHT TO THE END IT IT COULD HAVE GONE EITHER WAY WHAT 
WARRINGTON REALLY NEEDED TO DO WAS 
CALL TO MICRA TRIES IN A ROW THEY 
SAY TO THAT RIGHT TO THE END BUT 
THEY COULDN'T BREAK AWAY FROM SAINT 
HELENS TO STOP WHAT THEY NEEDED 
TO DO WAS SCORED TWO TRIES IN A ROW 
IT WAS A PLEASURE FOR EVERYBODY TO 
WITNESS 
AS QUIT BRITAIN COACH WITNESS AGAIN LIKE THAT HOW DOES THE DEPTH 
OF TALENT HELP YOU GREAT BRITAIN 
IT IS GREAT FOR ME TO STOP I WILL 
WATCH IT COUPLE OF TIMES AND WATCH HOW PEOPLE HANDLE PRESSURE 
THAT WAS PRESSURED GAME IN TOUGH 
CONDITIONS IT IS THE FIRST REALLY 
HOT DAY OF THE YEAR BOTH TEAMS 
SHOWED SIGNS OF FATIGUE AT TIMES 
BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS UNDER PRESSURE 
IT GIVES ME A CHANCE TO SEE WHO 
HANDLES IT AND WHO HANDLES IT WELL 
IT IS WORLD CUP YEAR ARE THINGS 
ARE SHAPING UP WELL 
VERY WELL 
THERE ARE A LOT OF TALENTED PLAYERS 
DOING A GREAT JOB AT THE MOMENT AND 
PUTTING ON GAMES LIKE THAT THERE 
IS A LOT OF BRITISH TALENT OUT 
THERE THEY ARE PUTTING IT ON 
DISPLAY IT IS GREAT FOR ME THEY 
ALL HAVE THE CHANCE OF BEING PICKED

SIDE WHILST LIAM KILLEEN ARE SOUTH 
AFRICAN GOAL KICKER KICKED A SEVENTY 
METRE PENALTY AND I KNEW THEN WE

OR BREAK A CAREER 
MORE DETAIL ON 
OUR WEBSITE JONATHAN 
I ONLY WENT 
THERE ONCE AND WE LOST AGAINST 
WIGAN UNFORTUNATELY BUT THE SEMI 
FINAL WE PLAYED LEEDS AND WIGAN 
AND ONE QUITE CONVINCINGLY SO THAT 
WAS A MEMORY FOR ME 
AND BRIAN YOU 
WERE COACHING BRADFORD WHEN ROBBIE 
SCORED THAT HAT TRICK 
I WAS 
ASSISTANT BUT IT WAS A GREAT MEMORY 
BECAUSE IT WAS A SUPERB HAT TRICK 
WE GOT TO MURRAYFIELD A COUPLE OF 
YEARS AFTER AND WON THE TROPHY L. 
CHIP KICK FROM NATHAN MCAVOY WAS A 
GREAT MEMORY THIRDLY I WAS STUCK 
IN THE LIFT WHEN WE WON THE TROPHY 
I WAS BEATING UP ON WELSH PEOPLE 
SANE GET ME OUT 
THEY NEED TO LOOK 
AT THEIR LIFTS L. WANT TO TALK ABOUT DWAIN CHAMBERS AND WE HAVEN'T 
GOT A 
LOT OF TIME THE DECISION WAS 
MAKING EARLIER THIS MONTH TAKEN 
EARLIER THIS WEEK THAT HIS CONTRACT 
WOULD NOT BE EXTENDED WITH 
CASTLEFORD HE PLAYED ONE RESERVES 
GAME WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF HIM IN 
ACTION 
IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME THAT ACTION HE HASN'T BEEN GIVEN A CONTRACT HE 
HASN'T PLAYED THE GAME BEFORE 
CREDIT TO HIM FOR HIS ATTITUDE HE 
HAS SPEED TO BURN BUT WHETHER HE 
HAS THE OTHER ATTRIBUTES TO MAKE A 
PROFESSIONAL RUGBY LEAGUE PLAYER 
AND WHETHER HE HAS THE TIME ON HIS 
SIDE BEING OVER THE AGE OF THIRTY I'M 
NOT SURE CREDIT TO HIM FOR MAKING 
THE ZIP MAKING THE DECISION TO 
HAVE A GO BRIAN YOU TO 
GIVE HIM 
A BIT 
OF CREDIT FOR TRYING 
HAVEN'T YOU 
I DON'T THINK IT WAS A 
P. R. STUNT AS PEOPLE SAID L. THINK HE 
WAS HAVING A SHOT AT IT 
UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T THINK HE HAS 
TIME BERTIE IS PRETTY DETERMINED 
DO YOU THINK HE WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH 
FOR LOWER LEAGUE 
IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO SAY IT TOOK ME MAYBE THREE TO 
SIX MONTHS TO ADJUST FROM UNION TO 
LEAGUE AND I PLAYED UNION ALL MY 
LIFE I KNEW HOW TO TACKLE AND HAD 
TO BEAT A 
WHERE 
TO BE ON 
THE FIELD ALL HE HAS TO DO IS RUN 
STRAIGHT IN HIS SPORT BUT YOU HAVE 
TO APPLAUD HIM FOR TRYING 
ONE OF 
THE REASONS I DIDN'T ASK YOU ABOUT 
YOUR CHALLENGE CUP MEMORIES IS 
THAT HOPEFULLY YOU WILL HAVE GOOD 
MEMORIES NEXT YEAR 
WE ARE PLODDING 
ALONG NICELY GETTING SOME PLAYERS 
BACK ALMOST HAVE A FULL SQUAD TO 
CHOOSE FROM WE KNOW HUDDERSFIELD 
WILL BE DIFFICULT THEIR FORM HAS 
BEEN A LITTLE INDIFFERENT OVER THE 
PAST MONTH OR SO THEY 
HAD A 
SUCCESSFUL RUN IN 
THE CUP 
A COUPLE 
OF YEARS AGO I'M SURE 
THEY WILL 
SEE 
IT AS 
AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
SOME GLORY 
FOR THEIR 
SEASON 
BUT WE 
HAVE A GOOD 
RECORD AT 
CRAVEN 
AND 
I'M REALLY 
LOOKING FORWARD TO 
THE CLASH TALKING OF 
THEIR FORM 
THE CLASH AND 
YOURS LET'S 
HAVE A 
CLOSER LOOK 
AT IT WITH DAMIEN 
WITH SIX WINS ALREADY THIS SEASON 
HULL K. R. ON COURSE TO BETTER LAST 
YEAR'S CISS FINISH THEY PUSHED 
LEEDS CLOSED TWO YEARS TWO WEEKS 
AGO THEY TOOK AN EARLY LEAD 
THROUGH DAVID MILLS KEITH SENIOR 
HAD A PAR FOUR SECOND HALF PUSH 
A DERBY DATE AGAINST DEADLY RIVALS 
HULL IT STARTED BADLY FOR JUSTIN 
MORGAN'S MEN WITH GARETH RAYNOR 
OPENING THE SCORING IN THE FIRST 
MINUTE BACK CAME ROVERS WITH 
SCORES FROM PETER FOX AND THIS TRY 
FROM DANNY FIX HENRY RAIN HAS 
SCORED HIS ONE HUNDRED TRY FOR HULL TO TIE 
THINGS UP 
AT THE 
BREAK 
IT WAS 
JUST 
AS TIGHT IN THE SECOND HALF CHEV 
WALKER LEVELLED THINGS UP ONCE 
AGAIN ADAM PIPE'S DROP GOAL SEVEN 
MINUTES FROM TIME GAVE HULL A 
PRECIOUS ONE POINTS ADVANTAGE 
ROVERS HAD THE FIELD POSITION THEY 
NEEDED JAKE WEBSTER CRASHED OVER 
TO MAKE MONKEYS OUT OF THEIR RIVALS 
IT FINISHED TWENTY TWO TO SEVENTEEN 
BY CONTRAST HUDDERSFIELD COME INTO 
TODAY'S GAME ON THE BACK OF THE HOT 
BAKING DEFEAT AGAINST WARRINGTON IN 
CARDIFF JOHN SHARPLES BESIDE RACED 
INTO A TWENTY TWO TO SIX HALF TIME LEAD ROB 
JONES AND'S SCORE UNDERLINED THE 
TIMES DOMINANCE THEY LOOK SET TO 
EXTEND THE ADVANTAGE AFTER THE 
BREAK ONLY FOR JOHNSTONE TO DROP 
THE BALL THEN CAME A MOMENT OF 
CONTROVERSY THAT TURNED THE GAME 
WARRINGTON'S WAY THE REFEREE 
APPEARED TO CALL THE TACKLE BEFORE 
STUART REARDON TOUCHED DOWN BUT THE 
TRY WAS GIVEN THAT GAVE WARRINGTON 
IMPETUS THEY NEEDED FURTHER SCORES 
FROM LEE BRIERS AND TWO FROM ANDY 
BASIC SET THEM ON COURSE FOR AN 
UNLIKELY VICTORY THE GIANTS WERE 
BACK WITHIN TWO PINT BUT 
BRIERS'S SECOND TRY SEALED THE 
COMEBACK IT LEFT THE CHANCE 
SECOND FROM BOTTOM IN THE 
SUPERLEAGUE SUPERLEAGUE IF MODEST YOU CAN BE THAT CLOSE TO 
A THEM THEY COULD BEAT YOU 
MICHAEL DOBSON BIG SIGNING FOR YOU
