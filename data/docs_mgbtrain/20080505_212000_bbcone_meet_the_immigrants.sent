MONICA LIMINOVITCH IS FROM POLAND 
SHE WORKS IN BOURNEMOUTH CARING FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE 
HELLO 
SORRY 
OH DEAR

SOMETIMES IT'S THREE TIMES A DAY 
AUTOMATICALLY YOU ARE 
VERY IMPORTANT PERSON FOR EACH OTHER ESPECIALLY FOR THEM 
SHE'S NOT BAD REALLY 
ARE YOU YOU'RE NOT BAD ARE YOU 
BEING A CARE WORKER IS A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR MONICA 
IN POLAND MONICA WORKED AS A PHARMACEUTICAL REP IN HER HOMETOWN OF POZNAN 
BUT SHE NEEDED A NEW CHALLENGE AND HAS GIVEN HERSELF A YEAR TO SEE IF SHE CAN COPE WITH LIFE IN ENGLAND 
O. K. 
DO YOU THINK POLISH PEOPLE THAT COME HERE ARE SURPRISED THEN BY I THINK SO YES YES 
HOW VERY EXPENSIVE LIFE IS HERE 
FLAT FOOD AND EVERYTHING 
DZIEKUJE 
DZIEKUJE IS THANK YOU THANKS 
YES THANKS 
AND GOOD MORNING IS DZIEN DOBRY 
DZIEN DOBRY BEAUTIFUL 
NOBODY KNOWS THE NUMBER OF NEW EUROPEAN MIGRANTS LIVING HERE 
NUMBERS AREN'T EVEN CALCULATED UNTIL THEY HAVE BEEN RESIDENT IN THE U. K. FOR A YEAR 
IN BOURNEMOUTH IT'S ESTIMATED ONE IN TWELVE OF THE POPULATION IS POLISH 
THE POLES MAKE UP THE LARGEST GROUP OF EUROPEAN MIGRANTS SETTLING IN BRITAIN 
THEY'VE SET UP THEIR OWN RADIO STATIONS AND POLAND UNITED ARE TOP OF THE LOCAL LEAGUE 
OUTLYING TOWNS AND VILLAGES ARE ALSO HOME TO LARGE NUMBERS OF POLISH PEOPLE 
TO COPE WITH THE RISING DEMAND FOR POLISH BREAD POLISH BAKERS HAVE STARTED THEIR OWN BUSINESSES 
IN BOURNEMOUTH EVEN MASS IN HELD IN POLISH 
THE CHURCH IS ALWAYS FULL TO OVERFLOWING AND THOSE WHO CAN'T GET IN WORSHIP OUTSIDE 
ON THE PAVEMENT 
THERE'S POLISH PEOPLE THERE'S POLISH COMMUNITY AND THE POLISH PRIESTS 
OF COURSE I CAN GO TO MY PLACES 
TO POLISH PLACES BUT 
THIS IS SOME KIND OF PROOF 
THAT ENGLAND IS OPEN BECAUSE WE CAN HAVE THESE PLACES HERE 
IN ENGLAND POLISH CHURCH IN ENGLAND 
SO I THINK YOU KNOW ENGLAND IS REALLY TOLERANCE COUNTRY 
I AM TRYING TO BE INTEGRATED YOU KNOW 
BUT MOST POLISH PEOPLE ARE REALLY CLOSE GROUP 
POLAND IN ENGLAND SMALL POLAND IN ENGLAND 
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO BE IN ENGLAND AND KNOW AS A POLISH 
PROUD OF MYSELF AND PROUD OF MY POLISH CULTURE NO ANOTHER CULTURE 
AT THE END OF THE SERVICE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY ARISES 
THIS TIME FOR THE LOCAL POLISH NEWSPAPER 
LATVIA JOINED THE EUROPEAN UNION AT THE SAME TIME AS POLAND 
AND MANY OF ITS CITIZENS HAVE ALSO HEADED WEST IN SEARCH OF A BETTER LIFE 
VICTOR TAMULIS IS TWENTY ONE AND IS COMING TO THE U. K. FOR THE FIRST TIME 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST ECONOMIC REASONS THAT HAVE MADE HIM LEAVE HIS WIFE AND SON AT HOME 
SO YOU'RE TIRED OF ME 
THANK YOU WELCOME THANK YOU 
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN GO I DON'T KNOW STRAWBERRY PICKING OR WHATEVER 
THEY GO THERE FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS O. K. THEY EARN SOME MONEY 
THEY COME BACK BUT IN THE END IT'S STILL YOU LEAVE LATVIA AS NO ONE 
BASICALLY AND YOU COME BACK AS NO ONE BUT WITH SOME MONEY 
THEN I REALLY DON'T SEE A POINT IN THAT 
SO BASICALLY WHAT I AM THINKING THAT 
WELL AT LEAST I HAVE PLANS THAT SOME DAY WE COULD MAKE IT A PERMANENT MOVE 
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT RIGHT 
YEAH REALLY YEAH YEAH 
VICTOR'S NEW JOB IS AT A HOTEL IN BOURNEMOUTH WHICH EVERY NIGHT HOSTS BALLROOM DANCING 
HE'S GOING TO BE THE HOTEL'S ODD JOB MAN BUT EVEN DOING THIS 
HE'LL TREBLE HIS LAST WAGE IN LATVIA AND BE ABLE TO HELP HIS FAMILY BY SENDING MONEY HOME 
THE HOTEL HAS THIRTY FIVE STAFF MOST OF WHOM ARE MIGRANTS 
FROM COUNTRIES LIKE BRAZIL COLUMBIA AND PORTUGAL 
ARE YOU O. K. WITH THE CHICKEN OR YOU ON A SPECIAL DIET 
VEGETARIAN NO YOU O. K. 
VICTOR'S NEW BOSS IS TERRI FLETT WHO USED TO BE A PROFESSIONAL DANCER 
GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR COMING 
IT'S ALL VERY WELL ME TROTTING AROUND AND YOU'RE SHOWING ME HOW TO RUN A HOTEL 
SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DANCE NOW 
OUR GUESTS COME HERE TO DANCE DON'T THEY 
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE IF YOU COULD FEEL WHAT THEY FEEL AND UNDERSTAND WHY THEY COME 
I WORKED AT A TRAVEL AGENCY BEFORE 
I HAVE SEEN ALL SORTS OF HOTELS WITH CATERING FOR ALL SORT OF NEEDS AND THINGS 
SOMETHING NEW AT LEAST FOR ME 
I DON'T WANNA BE ME THE BOSS AND THEM THE WORKERS 
I WANT US TO ALL BE ONE UNIT AND I THINK DANCING IS A GREAT THING YOU KNOW 
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU'RE OLD OR YOUNG 
IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER WHAT YOUR ABILITY IS IT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN DO ALL TOGETHER 
YOU CAN HOLD A LOVELY GIRL IN YOUR ARMS 
I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD BONDING THING 
GO ONE TWO THREE ONE TWO THREE BACK STEP 
I'VE ALWAYS HAD A VERY LIBERAL UPBRINGING THAT YOU DON'T GO BY 
THE COLOUR OF SOMEBODY'S SKIN OR RELIGION YOU TAKE THEM AS THEY ARE 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX 
BACK STEP ONE TWO THREE 
FOUR FIVE SIX 
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER THOUGHT ABOUT MYSELF AS AN ECONOMICAL MIGRANT 
AS FOR PEOPLE COMING OVER AND TAKING ALL THE JOBS 
JUST LOOK AT SOME NUMBERS AND PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THE PEOPLE 
THAT ARE COMING OVER WORK IN EITHER HOSPITALITY CATERING 
HONESTLY SPEAKING I DON'T SEE THE PROBLEM 
JESSICA CAN YOU PRINT FOR ME MY ROTA FOR SATURDAY SUNDAY MONDAY AND TUESDAY 
AND PREPARE FOR ME THIS P. FORTY SIX AND I LEFT SIGNED TODAY O. K. 
MONICA'S AMBITION TO COMPLETE A YEAR IN ENGLAND IS PROVING QUITE A CHALLENGE 
PROBLEM IS WHEN I ARRIVE FROM POLAND NOBODY TOLD ME THAT I SHOULD GET 
INSURANCE NUMBER TAX CODE 
THERE IS SOMETHING LIKE P. FORTY SIX OR SOMETHING LIKE EMERGENCY TAX 
I HAVEN'T GOT I HAVEN'T GOT IDEA 
I AM FEELING VERY UPSET AND VERY CONFUSED WITH NEW INFORMATION 
WHICH ACTUALLY I SHOULD FIX MYSELF AND FIGURE OUT I DON'T KNOW 
THIS IS NOT RIGHT I THINK 
IT SHOULD BE 
EASIER 
ALL RIGHT BYE BYE SEE YOU AT FRIDAY O. K. TAKE CARE 
ALL RIGHT BYE 
I START AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING FINISH AT TEN 
BETWEEN I HAVE A COUPLE OF HOURS TWO HOURS BREAK AND THEN I HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK 
SO I START AT MORNING AND I FINISH AT NIGHT 
THAT'S MY ALL DAY AND MY ALL WEEK 
EVERY TIME EVERY TIME THE SAME 
HOW MANY DAYS A WEEK DO YOU DO THAT 
SIX SIX 
I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER MUCH BETTER EASIER 
NOT EASIER BECAUSE I AM LAZY BUT EASIER BECAUSE IT'S VERY HARD 
VERY VERY VERY HARD 
YOU NEED TO WAKE UP EVERY DAY AT SIX O'CLOCK 
AND START AGAIN NEXT DAY THE SAME 
AFTER A MONTH AT THE HOTEL VICTOR'S GOT HIS FIRST APPRAISAL 
I SUPPOSE THE ONLY THING I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS BEING LATE 
I MEAN MAKING IT UP IS ONE THING YOU KNOW THAT CAN BE DONE 
BUT IT'S HARD FOR OTHER MEMBERS OF STAFF WHEN THEY'VE 
GOT OUT OF BED GOT READY AND THEY'RE HERE TEN MINUTES BEFORE TO START WORK 
AND VICTOR'S STILL IN BED 
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY REALLY NEED TO ADDRESS 
WE'D LIKE YOU TO SMILE BEFORE TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON BUT I THINK I'LL HAVE TO WORK ON THAT ONE 
I DO SMILE 
YOU ARE NOW AND WHAT A HANDSOME LAD YOU ARE WHEN YOU SMILE 
I SUPPOSE REALLY IT'S JUST REMEMBERING THAT YOU AND I 
WE'RE ON SHOW FOR THE WHOLE TIME WE'RE AT WORK 
YES I CAN FEEL GRUMPY OR UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING 
AND I COULD BE LIKE THAT WHEN I'M DOING SOMETHING IN THE ROOMS 
WHEN THE GUESTS AREN'T AROUND OR IN MY MAINTENANCE CUPBOARD YOU KNOW 
YEAH YOU DON'T HAVE TO SMILE IN THE CUPBOARD IT'S O. K. 
YEAH BUT IT'S ONLY MY PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW 
I LIKE TO SEE EVERYBODY SMILING COS ALL OUR GUESTS ARE ON HOLIDAY 
I'M ON THE HARD STUFF 
WITH ICE AND LEMON 
NO ICE I'LL HAVE A BIT OF LEMON PLEASE 
COULD BE FRENCH 
SPANISH MAYBE 
I COULD TELL EVERYONE I'M FRENCH VICTOR 
WELL WHAT ARE YOU TELL US 
I AM FROM LATVIA LATVIA OH I SEE VERY NICE 
YOUR ONE WITH LEMON ANYTHING ELSE NO THAT'S ALL FOR NOW THANKS VERY MUCH 
DO YOU KNOW WHERE LATVIA IS NOT REALLY NOT REALLY I'M NOT THAT EDUCATED 
YES PLEASE ORANGE JUICE AND A TONIC WATER MIXED TOGETHER PLEASE WITH A BIT OF ICE 
I DON'T LIKE WORKING IN A BAR 
I DON'T ENJOY THE WHOLE PART OF SPEAKING WITH CUSTOMERS 
AND PRETENDING YOU'RE ALL HAPPY AND YOU LIKE THEM A LOT YEAH 
I DO EXPECT YOU TO DO YOUR JOB AND IF THAT DOESN'T GET DONE 
THEN I WILL BE ON YOUR BACK IT'S NOT EASY TO FIRE ANYBODY ANY MORE EITHER 
YOU KNOW THOSE DAYS ARE GONE WHERE YOU CAN SAY YOU KNOW 
WE REALLY HAVE TO WORK THROUGH WARNINGS AND LETTERS ETC 
BUT I SUPPOSE I'M LUCKY AT THE MOMENT IT HASN'T ACTUALLY COME TO THAT 
FOUR MONTHS AFTER ARRIVING IN BOURNEMOUTH MONICA HAS HAD SOME BAD NEWS 
YESTERDAY I WAS JUST FIRED FROM MY JOB 
I LEFT MY WHOLE HEART IN THIS JOB AND THEY JUST FIRE ME LIKE SHIT ACTUALLY FROM JOB LIKE NOTHING 
DID THEY GIVE YOU WRITTEN REASONS 
NO O. K. WITHOUT GOING INTO THE SYSTEM IT SEEMS YOU'VE GOT A FEW OPTIONS 
CERTAINLY YOU DESERVE A WRITTEN REASON FOR A DISMISSAL 
THEY MUST GIVE YOU A WRITTEN REASON WHY YOU HAVE BEEN DISMISSED IF YOU ASK FOR IT 
WE CAN ASK FOR THAT ON YOUR BEHALF 
LEAVE IT WITH ME FOR A WHILE AND TRY TO PUT IT BEHIND YOU 
IF YOU KNOW ABOUT KIND OF THIS JOB WHICH WE ARE DOING IT'S 
MONICA I CAN SEE YOU'RE EMOTIONAL 
I CAN SEE HOW MUCH THIS HAS AFFECTED YOU 
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THE ACTIONS THAT WE CAN TAKE ARE LIMITED 
I'M GONNA KEEP YOUR DETAILS AND I'M GONNA TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT I CAN 
AFTER MORE ENQUIRIES PAUL HEATH FROM CITIZENS' ADVICE HAS HEARD BACK FROM MONICA'S FORMER EMPLOYER 
THE COMPANY DID STATE THAT THIS WAS A CASE OF GROSS MISCONDUCT 
AS TO WHETHER SHE'S GOT A CASE OR NOT I WOULDN'T BE TOO CLEAR ON THAT 
I SPOKE TO THE MANAGER AT THIS COMPANY WHO SAID TO ME THAT 
COS YOU ARE ABLE TO ELECT OUT OF WORK AND TIME REGULATIONS AND THAT'S WHAT SHE DID 
I SAID PROBABLY SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT 
IF WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THAT SHE AGREED TO OPT OUT OF THE WORK AND TIME REGULATIONS 
THEY WOULD HAVE EXPECTED HER TO PERFORM THE DUTIES BECAUSE THEY WERE SUPPORTING ELDERLY PEOPLE 
UNLESS SHE'S GOT PEOPLE WILLING TO SAY OH SHE WAS REALLY THERE ALL THE TIME 
THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO 
ACCORDING TO YOUR EMPLOYERS THEIR VERSION OF IT WAS 
ACTUALLY THEY THEY TELL ME ON FOUR OR FIVE OCCASIONS YOU FAILED TO COMPLETE YOUR ROTA IS THAT CORRECT 
NO THEY DISCOVERED MY ROTA AND I DIDN'T FINISH 
AND I CANCELLED JUST TWO LAST VISITS IT'S FRIDAY 
BECAUSE I WAS REALLY TIRED AND I JUST COULDN'T 
SO THAT'S THREE VISITS THAT YOU DIDN'T FINISH 
STEVE BUT THIS IS 
I'M NOT FEELING COMFORTABLE AT ALL NOW O. K. 
VICTOR'S WIFE ANITA HAS COME TO LONDON FOR A SHORT BREAK 
IT'S THEIR FIRST TIME TOGETHER IN TWO MONTHS 
I ALSO DON'T SPEAK A LOT 
IF I HAD AN OPTION I WOULDN'T SPEAK AT ALL 
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT AND HARD FOR ME TO ACCEPT BECAUSE I LIKE TO TALK A LOT 
IF I HAD AN OPTION TO SPEND A WEEK LET'S SAY IN TURKEY IN A FIVE STAR RESORT 
OR SOMEWHERE DEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF FOREST ALL BY MYSELF 
I WOULD GO FOR THE SECOND WITHOUT EVEN THINKING REALLY 
MONICA HAS RETURNED TO POLAND 
HE'S MY DADDY 
THE BIGGEST FACE IN THE WORLD AND I HAVE THE SAME FACE 
I USED TO HAVE COMPLEX BECAUSE OF THIS SO I WAS SHOUTING DADDY I WILL KILL YOU FOR THIS FACE 
I HAVE BIG HERE BIG HERE SO 
NOW IT'S O. K. 
IS ERM 
NO WORDS I DON'T HAVE TO USE WORDS 
YOU CAN SEE THAT 
NOW WHEN I'M HERE I FORGOT ABOUT REASON WHY WHY I WHY I WAS IN ENGLAND 
I KNOW THAT I REALLY LOVE THIS COUNTRY I'M FEELING MUCH MUCH STRONGER 
I'M NOT THINKING AT ALL ABOUT ENGLAND I'M JUST WITH MY FRIENDS 
WITH MY FAMILY AND I APPRECIATE REALLY EVERY SECOND EVERY 
MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER 
BUT IN THE ENGLAND THEY THEY REALISED THAT IT'S NOT GOOD AS AS THEY THOUGHT BEFORE 
BUT MAYBE I WISH HER VERY GOOD BUT IT DEPENDS ON HER 
MONICA PROMISED HERSELF SHE'D SPEND A YEAR IN ENGLAND 
AND THAT'S WHAT SHE'S GOING TO DO RETURN AND FIND ANOTHER JOB 
I MADE DECISION AND THIS IS IMPORTANT DECISION FOR ME 
AND IT'S ONE YEAR OF ERM OF CHALLENGE FOR ME 
MY FAMILY GAVE ME WORDS LIKE MONICA YOU ARE AMAZING MONICA YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT 
AND THEY SAID THIS IS YOUR CHOICE YOU HAVE TO STAY IN YOUR CULTURE WITH HUGE RESPECT FOR SOMEONE ELSE 
AND ESPECIALLY FOR ENGLISH PEOPLE WHICH YOU ARE STILL GUEST 
LET'S FACE IT WE OPEN THE GATES AND ASK THESE WORKERS TO COME BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO DO 
THESE JOBS THAT THEY DO THEY WORK RIDICULOUSLY LONG HOURS 
YOU KNOW WITHOUT OUR MIGRANT WORKERS WE JUST WOULDN'T HAVE AN INDUSTRY 
AFTER TWO MONTHS OF LESSONS VICTOR'S READY TO TAKE TO THE DANCE FLOOR WITH THE GUESTS 
AND A SMILE 
I THINK I HAVE INTEGRATED 
I DON'T DOUBT THAT MAJORITY OF PEOPLE STILL ARE ARE LOOKING AT ME AS OUTSIDER 
BUT IT DOESN'T DOESN'T REALLY BOTHER ME 
IT'S EVERYONE'S RIGHT TO THINK SOMETHING ABOUT ANOTHER PERSON 
AT LEAST SO FAR I HAVEN'T FELT IT AS A PROBLEM FOR ME 
THAT UPSETS ME OR AFFECTS MY LIFE IN ANY WAY 
IT IS HARD YES I MISS MY FAMILY I MISS SEEING MY SON 
EVEN MORE NOW HE'S PICKING UP MORE AND MORE THINGS NEW WORDS 
THEN AGAIN I SUPPOSE THAT'S A CHOICE THAT WAS MADE 
SO I CAN FEEL SORRY ABOUT IT 
I CAN FEEL BAD ABOUT IT 
AND THE SAME TIME IT'S STILL IT ALL BOILS DOWN THAT 
I I. I CAN'T TURN BACK 
I MEAN IT IT'S BEEN DONE AND THAT'S IT 
WHATEVER YOU DO NEXT IN THE FUTURE THERE'LL NEVER BE ANOTHER JOB LIKE THIS ONE I PROMISE YOU 
TURN THE GIRLS OUT LITTLE SPIN 
THANK YOU 
NEXT WEEK WE MEET SUZY 
YOU SEE MY ROOM NO LOCK
