SOME OF MY PIZZA TO BE HONEST WOULD 
IT BE WHOLE PIZZA 
NO WE ONLY DO 
HALF HALVES I'M THINKING ABOUT THE 
OBESE NATION 
YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT 
AS THIS TASK CAME UP AS ONE WHO 
LIVED IN PUBS FROM FOURTEEN YOU MUST 
HAVE THOT I CAN'T LOSE THIS ONE 
YOU DON'T USE THE WORD LOSE I 
REMEMBERED 
I'M DISAPPOINTED TO BE REMEMBERED HONEST BECAUSE AS YOU RIGHTLY SAY I 
GREW UP IN AND AROUND THE INDUSTRY 
SO TO NOT HAVE WON IS A HUGE 
DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME 
YOUR ZAD A 
CHEF 
PRETENDS TO BE 
HE WAS IN THE CHEF AUDIENCE HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT 
LETTING YOU DOWN DID YOUR BOY LET 
YOU DOWN 
YES IT'S ONE OF THOSE 
THINGS 
CHEER DAD 
HE WAS SUPPOSED THINGS TO BE IN CHARGE OF TASK HECLE ONLY 
RUN SO MANY THINGS FROM WHERE HE 
WAS IF I MANAGE MY KITCHEN I 
EXPECT PEOPLE WORKING FOR ME TO 
COMPLETE THE TASK THEY DO IF THEY 
CAN'T IT DOPBLT COME TOGETHER IF 
ONE PART OF THE TEAM IN THE KITCHEN 
DOESN'T WORK YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
YOU DID EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY WHICH YOU TOOK IN ONE 
NIGHT NIGHT THE BOTTOM LINE COUNTS THE COSTS 
WEREN'T REALLY CONTROLLED THEY 
WERE FIVE HUNDRED FORTY THREE 
WE SPENT A COUPLE OF 
QUID IT HAS TO BE SAID 
THAT IS 
WHERE IT WENT WRONG LET'S REMIND 
YOURSELVES HOW IT WENT WRONG 
I'M A 
GREAT LEADER 
HOW WAS IAN AS A TEAM 
LEADER 
I'M CONCERNED LEE MCQUEEN IS 
CONCERNED WHAT WE ARE DOING IS 
PLUCKING PRIZES OUT OF THE AIR YOU YOU FIXED THE PRIZES BUT YOU HAD IDEA 
OF THE QUANTITIES YOU WERE GOING TO 
SAY OR WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO NEED 
TO BUY 
I WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU 
DIDN'T HAVE SOME FORM OF CONTROL OF 
THE COSTINGS 
DON'T YOU THINK YOU 
OVERSMENT OVERSPENT HIS HIS MANAGEMENT STYLE WAS AKEEN TO DAVID 
BRENT 
KEEP TUP THERE 
WE NEED TO BRENT COOK 
IF WE DON'T HAVE THE FOOD COOK READY IT'S YOUR FAULT FINE CAN FINE CAN YOU GET US BLACK BAGS 
WHY HAVE I 
GOT TO BUY BLACK BAGS FUCKING TIN 
OPENERS ARE YOU HAVING A LAUGH 
I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH DELEGATION 
ANY CHANCE WHEN I GO TO TO THE LOO 
YOU CAN WIPE MY BUM THAT IS WHAT 
IT WAS LIKE YOU DIDN'T DO NOTHING 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT BLOODY CLUE NOT 
A BLOODY CLUE 
SO AS CHEF WHERE DID THEY GO 
WRONG WITH THE COST FRPLTS WELL 
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THEY DIDN'T 
WORK OUT EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE 
GOING TO SELL IN THE FIRST INSTANCE 
THEY DIDN'T COST STUFF IN VOLUME 
THEY MP TALKING ABOUT ONE PORTION 
RATHER THAN TALKING ABOUT HUGE 
AMOUNTS OF FOOD THEY ARE TALKING 
ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE MONEY THAT IS 
THE BIG THING THE GREAT OLD SAYING 
WHICH IS TURNOVER IS VANITY AND 
PROFIT IS SANITY THERE WASN'T THE 
PROOF THAIT WENT WITH IT THAT IS 
THE BIG ISSUE THERE WAS AN 
INTERESTING POINT WITH THE WHOLE 
IDEA OF BUYING STUFF IN BULK AND 
THEN TRYING TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT 
TOMATO THING BUYING THE TOMATOES 
AND MAKING SOMETHING UP WHICH IS 
GENERIC TO AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT 
TOMATO SAUCE MAKES ALL SORTS OF 
THINGS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE 
RIGHT IDEA HE BOUGHT READY MADE 
SAUCES 
DIGGING THROUGH THE SHELVES SAUCES POTS OF READY MADE SAUCE TO PUT 
INTO A BOWL OF PASTA ITALIAN FOOD 
ISN'T EXPENSIVE TO MAKE SPAGHETTI 
BOLL NIECE WE CAN MAKE IT AT HOME 
NOT AN ISSUE 
WHEN JUMPY GRANDAD OR 
SIR ALAN TOLD THEM THEY WERE GOING 
TO BE WORKING IN A PUB I THOUGHT 
GREAT GIVEN THE LAST TWO WEEK'S 
RECORD THEY WILL HAVE TO ORGANISE A 
PISS UP IN A BRUERY THIS WEEK L. 
WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO HOW THEY GOT 
ON I JUST THINK ORGANISATIONLY IT 
WAS A MESS REALLY 
BECAUSE I THINK THEY COOKED THE 
WRONG STUFF THEY DID COMPLICATED 
STUFF I MEAN ITALIAN FOOD THEY 
COULD HAVE JUST DONE FRIED BREAD 
SANDWICH OR SOMETHING WHICH IS 
WHAT I USED TO HAVE AT COLLEGE YOU 
KNOW SPAGBOL HOW CAN YOU MAKE IT 
THAT TASTES RUBBISH L. EWESED TO 
DRINK FOURTEEN PINTS OF VODKA WITH A 
BAILEY'S CHASER AND MAKE A DECENT 
SPAG BOL 
CAN I HAVE YOUR RECIPE 
PLEASE 
YES 
YOU CAN I WILL TAKE PLEASE YOU OUT AS WELL 
THERE IS AN OFFER 
YOU CAN SPEND MONEY CHASING 
CELEBRITES AROUND FOR EXAMPLE YOU 
SPEND AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY HOW DO 
YOU KEEP COSTS DOWN AND HOW DID 
THEY FAIL TO DO IT 
PLANNING WAS A 
PROBLEM YOU SAID AT THE BEGINNING 
YOU SAID YOU WOULD OFFER CLEAR AND 
CONCISE LEADERSHIP I DON'T THINK 
YOU OFFERED ANY L. GOT THE 
IMPRESSION I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS 
THE TRUE YOU WENT IN SAYING YOU 
WILL KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN AT THE 
FIRST HALF OF THE SERIES AND TEAM 
LEADER IN YOU WERE TAKEN AABACK YOU 
WERE TEAM LEADER THIS EARLY YOU 
WANTED TO PUT EVERYTHING ON TO 
KEVIN IS THAT CORRECT YOU GOT 
WORRIED ABOUT BEING IN CHARGE OF 
THAT TEAM 
I WASN'T WORRIED ABOUT 
BEING IN CHARGE OF THE TEAM PARDON 
ME PUTTING THE BANKER IN CHARGE OF 
COSTS BEING IN CHARGE OF THE TEAM 
I WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO DO IT 
HAPPENED THE TASK I SHOULD HAVE 
EXCELLED IN OBVIOUSLY IN THE END 
DIDN'T NO I DIDN'T HAVE ANY 
TACTICS TO KEEP MY HEAD DOWN AT ALL 
NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST L. WAS MORE 
THAN WILLING TO STEP UP WHEN NEEDED 
GOING BACK TO THE COSTS IS THERE 
FORMULA FOR CALCULATING WHAT A MEAL 
SHOULD COST THEY NTH COULDN'T WORK 
OUT HOW TO PRICE THINGS DO YOU 
LOOK AT THE INGREDIENTS 
YOU DO 
MORE BECAUSE OF VAT YOU HAVE TWENTY PER CENT OF 
VAT 
I DON'T THINK THEY WERE VAT VAT REGISTERED OR THEY WOULD NOT MAKE 
PROFIT YOU HAVE TO MULTIPLY IT BY 
THREE IT IS NOT JUST FOOD COST 
STAFF RENT RESTAURANTS DON'T MAKE 
MONEY WE CAN SEE WHY THERE WAS 
THE ISSUE OF THIS MEETING THAT WAS 
CALLED IT DID SEEM TO US THAT YOU 
DID TELL A BIT OF A PORKY IN THE 
BOARD ROOM LET'S EXAMINE THE FACTS 
SHALL WE 
YOU SAY ARE YOU A STICKLEER FOR HONESTY TO BE FAIR 
DISHONESTY IN THE WORKPLACE PISSES 
ME OFF 
AT FIVE P. M. I WAS CONCERNED AT 
THE LACK OF LEADERSHIP I TOOK 
EVERYONE OUTSIDE 
YOU DID 
YES I 
DID YOU DID FANTASTIC JOB OUT 
THERE I HAD TO TAKE CHARGE OR IT 
BOO HAVE FALLEN APART HE HAD NO 
LEADERSHIP SKILLS 
DID HE CALL THE 
TEAM OUTSIDE AND HAVE A PEP TALK 
NO HE DIDN'T 
HE DID OR HE DIDN'T 
HE DIDN'T HE DID

I DID I WANT A BIG DRIVE GO OUT DID THERE SMILES ON YOUR FACES HE 
DIDN'T DO IT 
KEVIN DIDN'T GET THE 
TEAM TOGETHER SIFR ALAN 
HE SAID TO 
ME I CALLED THE TEAM TOGETHER AND 
I GAVE THEM A PREP TALK YOU ARE 
SAYING HE DIDN'T 
LOAD OF RUBBISH 
HOW THE HELL CAN HE SAY I DIDN'T

ABOUT GOING INTO POLITICS

DID DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER 
LET'S GIVE HIM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE 
YOUR JOB MARK BROADCASTING AND 
WRITING ABOUT CELEBRITES THAT IS 
ONE BIG LIE CELEBRITY REALLY ISN'T 
IT 
SOME OF THEM CHOOSE TO LIE L. IT THINK IT IS VERY INTERESTING WHEN 
YOU TRY AND DIG IN THERE AND TRY TO 
FIND WHOUT IS TELLING THE TRUTH AND 
WHO ISN'T TELLING THE TRUTH WHEN 
YOU HAD TWO OF THEM GANGING UP ON 
YOU IT WAS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM L. 
THINK YOU CAN WIN YOUR WAY IN THE 
BOARD ROOM IF SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
HAPPENED BY CONFUSING THINGS A 
LITTLE BECAUSE OF THE TWO OF THEM 
YOU KNOW HAVING A GO AT YOU FROM 
BOTH SIDES THAT IS WHEN IT BECOME 
AS PROBLEM 
YOU SAY ANYTHING IT WAS 
FIGHTING A REAR GUARD ACTION YOU 
WOULDN'T BLAME HIM FOR LYING AT 
THAT POINT YOU MIGHT TRY ANYTHING 
I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR DOING THAT 
THE PROBLEM WITH LYING ON THE TELLY 
IS THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE AND 
PEOPLE CAN SPOT IT CAN'T THEY 
THAT IS MY RULE DON'T LIE WHEN ARE 
YOU ON THE TELLY AND IT WILL BE ALL 
RIGHT 
WHAT THE BOYS COSTS RIGHT SPIRALLING OUT OF CONTROL THE GIRLS

UGLY TEAM WE DIDN'T FLIRT ENOUGH

AS MUCH AS YOU CAN IN THE FIRST 
INCOMPETENT STANCE THERE IS NO 
REASON WHY THEY SHOULD VNT BOUGHT 
FROM THE MARKETS 
MEDIA TYPES LIKE

YOU ARE IN THE POSITION OF VICTIM 
AND PORTRAY OTHER PEOPLE IN BAD 
LIGHT TO ACTUALLY ELEVATE YOUR 
POSITION I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WHAT 
YOU ARE SAYING IS A CORRECT B. 
ACCURATE I THINK YOU ARE HIGHLY 
MANIPULATIVE YOUNG LADY 
NEVER DID SHE LOOK MORE LIKE A 
SCHOOL MISTRESS WHEN WAS THE LAST 
TIME SOMEONE CALLED YOU YOUNG 
LADY LIKE THAT IT IS A DISGRACEFUL 
WAY TO TALK TO SOMEONE 
NOT EVEN 
WHEN I WAS TEN THEY SHOULD EMPLOY 
HER AS A STATION ANNOUNCER THAT 
WOULD SORT OUT OVERCROWDING ON THE 
TRAINS SHE HAS A VOICE THAT MAKES 
YOU FEEL SUICIDAL EVEN IF SHE WAS 
BEING NICE TO YOU YOU WOULD WANT TO 
KILL YOURSELF WOULDN'T YOU SHE 
SOUNDS LIKE A HEAD MISTRESS IT'S 
HORRIBLE 
EVEN IF SHE IS RIGHT IN HORRIBLE AN ARGUMENT YOU WOULD SIDE AGAINST 
HER BECAUSE OF THE MANNER OF DOING 
IT WE SAW HER IN HER REAL LIGHT 
LAST WEEK HER CARDS ARE MARKED AS 
FAR AS THIS SERIES IS CONCERNED 
HOW WOULD YOU HAVE LIKED TO HAVE 
BEEN LED BY JENNY 
I WOULD LOVE TO 
HAVE BEEN LEAD BY JENNY IT WOULD BE 
AN EXPERIENCE IT WOULD BE VERY 
INTERESTING INDEED TO TRY AND GET A 
WORD IN EDGE WAYS 
YOU LIKE THE 
MORE DOMINATING WOMAN 
NO COMMENT 
I COULDN'T COMMENT 
LET'S HEAR WHAT YOUR BOSS SAID 
ABOUT YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES AND 
FRIENDS FRIENDS BRACE YOUR SELF THIS IS THE 
DIFFICULT BIT 
IAN CAME FROM A FAMILY THAT LIVED 
IN PUBS WORKED IN PUBS HE LIVED 
ABOVE PARKS L. THOUGHT THIS WOULD 
BE A WALK IN THE PARK 
I'VE WORKED 
IN PLACES LIKE THIS SINCE THE AGE 
OF ABOUT FOURTEEN 
YOU'VE BEEN TELLING ME 
TO CALM DOWN AND NOBODY LISTENED 
YESTERDAY WHEN I SAID WE HAD TO GET 
THIS SET 
HE DISMISSED ME OUT OF HAND AND 
TOLD ME TO BE POSITIVE GREAT IAN 
I'LL BE POSITIVE BUT GIVE ME 
SOMETHING TO BE POSITIVE ABOUT HE HE DOESN'T USE THE WORD LOSER BELIEVE 
ME HE WAS A LOSER IN THIS CASE 
USELESS 
IF IAN RUN A BANK EVERY USELESS CUSTOMER WOULD CLOSE THEIR ACCOUNT 
COMPANY WOULD LOSE 
MILLIONS OF POUNDS AND THE STAFF 
WOULD WALK OUT 
HIS COSTS WERE 
TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL THEY DIDN'T 
EXIST HE PURCHASED FROM THE WRONG 
PLACES HIS LEADERSHIP OF THE MEN 
WAS USELESS THAT'S WHY I FIRED HIM 
HE JUST HAD TO GO 
DO YOU WANT TO 
CHEERS BUDDIES DO DO YOU WANT TO REACT TO THAT 
IT WAS A 
STRESSFUL SITUATION AT THE END OF 
THE DAY WE TOOK OVER EIGHT HUNDRED IN ONE 
NIGHT WE HAD TO RESOURCE WE HAD 
TO GET ALL THE STAFF THE MARKETING 
WE HAD TO GET BUMS ON SEATS AND 
SERVE PEOPLE IN AN ESTABLISHMENT 
THIS PLACE HAD NEVER DONE FOOD 
BEFORE REGARDLESS OF EVERYTHING I 
WILL GIVE MY DIGNITY FOREVER AND 
I'M PROUD OF ALL OF THEM WITH WITH KEVIN 
GOD LOVE HIM 
WERE YOU 
TRYING TO DROP HIM IN IT 
VOLUNTEER FOR THE CHEF'S JOB HE HE WANTED TO BE HEAD CHEF SOY MADE 
HIM HEAD CHEF THERE WASN'T A PLACE 
FOR A GAY WELSH COMEDY CHARACTER 
OTHER OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN DAVYYD 
EVEN WHEN HE 
VOLUNTEERED TO BE CHEF AND YOU 
EXPLAINED HOW IMPORTANT THE JOB WAS 
AND HOW HE'D BE IN TROUBLE WHEN HE 
GOT IT WRONG IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT 
IT DAWNED ON HIM 
WHAT HE HAD DONE 
EVERYTHING THAT COMES OUT THAT 
KITCHEN ON YOUR HEAD BE IT 
IT'S A 
LIGHTBULB MOMENT HE HAD A GO AT 
YOU SAYING IF YOU WERE A BANK 
MANAGER IT WOULD BE A DISASTER AS 
A BANK MANAGER I HOPE HE'S BETTER 
AT COUNTING MONEY THAN COUNTING 
TOMATOES HERE HE SAYS FOR FOUR 
PEOPLE HE NEEDS TEN TOMATOES THEN 
HE SAYS FOR FIFTEEN PEOPLE HE NEEDS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
TOMATOES THAT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT 
YOU CAN ALSO SEE HIS HANDS MOVING 
AS HE TRIES TO COUNT UP HE GETS 
MORE CONFUSED AS HE GOES ALONG HOW HOW MANY TOMATOES DO YOU NEED 
FOR THE 
SOUP FOR FOUR PEOPLE WE NEED TEN 
FRESH TOMATOES IF YOU'RE LOOKING 
AT SAY FIFTEEN PEOPLE ORDERERING THE 
SOUP YEAH 
RIGHT THEN YOU KNOW SOUP YEAH IS IT WORTH BECAUSE WE'RE CATERING 
FOR OTHER PEOPLE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
IS IT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY WORTH CONSIDERING 
TEN FOR FOUR 
GIVE ME MINUTE 
GO ON 
IF WE'RE 
CATERING FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND DOING 
ITALIAN FOOD MOST ITALIAN FOOD I 
KNOW IS TOMATO BASED 
WE NEED FORTY 
INDIVIDUAL TOMATOES EVEN IF YOU 
HAVE ONE TABLE OF FOUR AND THEY ALL 
ORDERED SOUP THAT'S FOUR PORTIONS 
DOWN THAT MEANS YOU'D ONLY HAVE 
WHAT SIX ELEVEN PORTIONS LEFT 
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT HIM 
THEN THINKING HE'S GOT TO GET FIRED 
HERE EVEN IF HE WE WIN HE LOOKED 
SO INCOMPETENT 
I THOUGHT HE 
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HIS NUMBERS ARE 
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW HIS 
NUMBERS THE PERSON ON THE MARKET 
STALL BEHIND US HE HAD PACKED UP 
AND GONE HOME 
ALL THINGS 
CONSIDERED WE THINK KEVIN IS 
DEFINITELY THIS WEEK'S HUE DEANY 
THE ONE WHO MANAGED TO ESCAPE I I CAME UP WITH THE CONCEPT OF HAVING 
ITALIAN L. EAT IN A LOT OF ITALIAN 
RESTAURANTS AND I KNOW WHAT'S 
POPULAR 
YOU DESIGNED THE MENU POPULAR BECAUSE I EAT IN ITALIAN 
RESTAURANTS 
IT'S TASTELESS IT RESTAURANTS NEEDS TO BE SEASONED 
I'VE JUST 
GIVEN AWAY TWO MAIN MEALS BECAUSE 
THE CUSTOMERS ARE DISGUSTED WITH 
THE FOOD 
I'D LIKE TO THINK I'M A 
CULINARY ADVENTURER 
I WAS THINKING OF A CARBONARA SO 
BASIC BASON OR HAM OR CHICKEN 
BACON OR HAM OR CHICKEN L. DON'T 
KNOW SALTED POTATOES 
HOW ITALIAN 
IS THAT 
I'VE SEEN THAT IN A LOT OF 
ITALIAN RESTAURANTS 
I'LL DO THAT 
NOW FOR YOU RELAX 
MATE I'M THE 
CHEF THAT'S WHAT CHEFS DO WE 
COULD GET A THIRTY MACHINE AND MAKE 
LATTES 
LET'S CONCENTRATE ON LATTES DESERTS 
COFFEE COMES UNDER DESERT DESERTS DOES COFFEE COME UNDER DESERT NO NO RIGHT O. K. MOVE ON THEN 
WE HAVE 
JACK ACKLAND WITH US WHO WAS 
DESPERATELY FAILING IN THE TOND 
KEEP A STRAIGHT FACE THERE WHAT 
DUE MAKE OF HIM AS A CHEF SNFRPBLTS 
HE DIDN'T STAND OUT AS THE HEAD 
CHEF ALL THE BOYS MUCKED IN 
TOGETHER IF IT WAS ON TEAM WORK 
THEY WOULD HAVE WON BUT IT WAS 
DOWN TO MAKING MONEY AND SERVING 
THE FOOD 
DID HE STRIKE YOU AS THE MAN WHO 
HAD THE FAINTEST IDEA OF HOW TO 
MAKE A CARBONARA NO L. 
DON'T THINK 
MAKE A CARBONARA NO I DON'T THINK HE COULD HAVE MADE A LATTE TO BE 
HONEST WITH YOU 
THEY SHOULD HAVE 
GONE SIMPLER 
IF YOU THINK ABOUT 
THE CONCEPT OF IT WHY REDRESS AN 
ENGLISH PUB SERVE ENGLISH FOOD IN 
AN ENGLISH PUB YOU DON'T KNOW HOW 
TO COOK MAKE FISH FINGER SANDWICH 
WITH MAYONNAISE SAUSAGES AND CHIPS 
BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL GO TO A PUB FOR 
FOOD 
MY FAVOURITE BIT OF THAT FOOD DISCUSSION WAS WHERE THEY WERE 
TALKING ABOUT THE ITALIAN THING AND 
SOMEONE SAID LET'S ALL PUT 
MOUSTACHES ON AND THEN LET'S SPEAK 
IN ITALIAN ACCENT A LITTLE VOICE 
WENT HOW DO YOU SPELL ACCENTS AT 
THAT POINT ONE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE 
SAID CRAP AYE DEEA 
THEN THE IDEA OF 
THE SHRINKING PEETSYA THE CUSTOMER 
CONCERNED ABOUT HAVE HE DID HAVE A 
RUDIMENTARY GRASP OF GEOMETRY THE THE SALT IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU 
NEED 
IS THIS A WHOLE PIZZA IT IT ISN'T THERE'S BEEN BASICALLY THE 
CHEF SAID TO ME BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T 
GOT ANY MORE WHOLE PIZZAS LEFT 
THEY'VE KIND OF PIGGER PIECES THAT 
WE'VE SEGMENTED FIFTY FIFTY T. H. S. 
IT DOESN'T 
SEEM WE HAVE A WHOLE PIZZA I I UNDERSTAND THAT L. WILL GET YOU A 
PROPER PIZZA L. APOLOGISE ABOUT
