THIS IS FABLE SHE'S A TEN MONTH OLD LABRADOR PUPPY 
SHE DOESN'T KNOW IT YET BUT TONIGHT SHE'S GONNA BE INVOLVED IN A VERY IMPORTANT RESCUE 
THAT'S BECAUSE FABLE BELONGS TO THE CLIFF RESCUE TEAM 
WHICH HELPS PEOPLE WHO GET STUCK OR LOST ON THE CLIFFS 
FABLE COME HERE 
TONIGHT FABLE AND HER OWNER ROB HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT PRACTICE 
BACK AT HEADQUARTERS THE TEAM WAS GETTING READY FOR THE NIGHT AHEAD 
FOR A NIGHT RESCUE LIGHTS ARE VITAL EVEN FOR A PRACTICE RUN BY THE TIME WE HIT THOSE CLIFFS 
IT'LL BE PITCH DARK OUT THERE 
IT'S A BIT LIKE A GAME OF HIDE AND SEEK BUT FOR REAL 
AS THE HELICOPTER LIFTED UP WE SAW THE LIGHTS OF THE TOWN SPREAD OUT BELOW US 
WITHIN A FEW MOMENTS WE'D LEFT THEM FAR BEHIND AND DARKNESS WAS ALL WE COULD SEE 
I REALISED JUST HOW MUCH WE'D NEED ALL THE TORCHES AND LAMPS WE HAD WITH US TO CUT THROUGH THE DARKNESS 
IN THE END IT WAS THE POWERFUL HELICOPTER LIGHTS WHICH PICKED OUT ROB AND FABLE SAFE ON THE CLIFF 
BUT FAR BELOW US 
IT WAS A STEEP AND TRICKY CLIMB 
THROUGHOUT THE RESCUE 
THE HELICOPTER HOVERED OVERHEAD 
TO GIVE US ALL THE LIGHT WE SO DESPERATELY NEEDED 
OUR BRAVE LABRADOR WAS THE REAL HERO OF THE NIGHT 
NOT IN THE LEAST BIT WORRIED BY THE BRIGHT HELICOPTER HEADLIGHTS 
SHE REACHED THE CLIFF TOP SMOOTHLY AND SAFELY 
SHE DID MAKE IT LOOK EASY BUT DON'T BE FOOLED BY ALL THAT TAIL WAGGING 
A CLIFF TOP NIGHT RESCUE IS A REAL ADVENTURE 
YOU LOT SEEM TO THINK US BADGERS AREN'T VERY FRIENDLY COS YOU DON'T SEE US DURING THE DAY 
THE REAL REASON IS OUR EYES SEE A LOT BETTER IN THE DARKNESS 
SO WE LIKE TO GO OUT AT NIGHT LOOK AROUND LIKE ME HERE IN THIS PLAYGROUND 
LET'S SEE OOH NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THAT 
THE GOOD THING IS I CAN SEE WHERE I'M GOING AND SMELL MY WAY AS I GO 
I LIKE TO EXPLORE ALL THE FOOD YOU'VE LEFT FOR ME OVERNIGHT 
HUMAN BEINGS ARE LAZY ABOUT PUTTING THINGS IN BINS THERE'S PLENTY FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS TO EAT 
LIKE THIS FELLOW HERE 
WE CAN GO AROUND ALL NIGHT WITHOUT BEING DISTURBED AND EAT WHATEVER WE FANCY WHAT'VE YOU GOT THERE 
NOT JOINING ME O. K. 
ANCHOU LOVED HIS BED IT WAS WARM AND COSY 
A VERY SNOOZY WOOZY SORT OF BED 
AND EVERY NIGHT DAD SAID THE SAME THINGS GOOD NIGHT ANCHOU 
THEN HE'D WALK TO THE DOOR AND SAY SLEEP TIGHT ANCHOU SWEET DREAMS 
BEFORE TURNING OUT THE LIGHT AND CLOSING THE DOOR 
NOW ANCHOU WASN'T AFRAID OF THE DARK BUT HE WAS A LITTLE CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS 
AND EVERY NIGHT IT WAS THE SAME 
FIRST IT WAS DARK 
VERY DARK 
ANCHOU WONDERED ARE MY EYES OPEN OR CLOSED 
HE COULD FEEL MR. BEANS HIS VERY FAVOURITE TEDDY BEAR BUT HE COULDN'T SEE HIM AT ALL 
AND THEN HE STARTED TO KNOW THAT HIS EYES WERE OPEN BECAUSE GRADUALLY 
ONE BY ONE HE NOTICED LIGHTS IN THE DARKNESS 
IN THE ROOM WAS A GENTLE LIGHT WHICH ALWAYS MADE HIM FEEL SAFE AND COSY 
THEN AS HIS EYES WANDERED HE COULD SEE A LONG THIN SLIVER OF LIGHT 
SOMETIMES WHITE LIGHT RACED ACROSS THE CURTAINS LIGHTING UP THE ROOM 
MAKING SHADOWS THAT SWEPT AROUND THE WALLS 
THEN WHEN ALL WAS QUIET 
ANCHOU WOULD PEEP THROUGH A GAP IN THE CURTAINS TO LOOK AT THE GLOWING YELLOW STREETLIGHT 
BUT THIS TIME HE ALSO SAW TWO TINY YELLOW LIGHTS WHAT COULD THEY BE 
THEN THEY BLINKED AT HIM 
BUT THERE WAS ALSO A SPECIAL LIGHT WHICH HE SOMETIMES SAW IN HIS ROOM AT NIGHT TIME 
A SOFT SILVER GLOW WHICH CREPT ACROSS THE CARPET 
THIS WAS ANCHOU'S FAVOURITE 
NOW THAT ANCHOU'S EYES WERE GETTING USED TO THE DARK HE COULD SEE HIS TOYS AND BOOKS ON THE SHELF 
BESIDE THEM NUMBERS FLASHED STEADILY ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT 
AND AS HE WATCHED HIS EYES GREW HEAVY AND SOON HE WAS FAST ASLEEP 
DREAMING SWEETLY OF CATS AND CLOCKS 
AND MOONS AND CARS AND 
THE CITY OF TROMSO IS BUILT ON AN ISLAND IN NORWAY 
AND IS THE MOST NORTHERLY CITY IN THE WHOLE WORLD 
IT IS SURROUNDED BY ICY SEAS VICKY IS ARRIVING AT ELEVEN AT NIGHT 
THE SIGHTSEEING HAD BETTER WAIT TILL DAYLIGHT I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING 
AT NINE O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING HER ALARM GOES OFF 
IT'S STILL DARK 
IT'S NOW TEN IN THE MORNING AND VICKY LOOKS OUTSIDE AGAIN 
STILL DARK 
ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING 
AND IT'S STILL DARK 
STILL DARK 
IT'S NOW TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AND IT'S STILL DARK I RECKON I NEED A BIT OF ASSISTANCE 
FROM THE WEATHER STATION 
THIS IS A METER FOR MEASURING THE NUMBER OF HOURS OF SUNLIGHT 
THE SUNSHINE METER'S ALL THE WAY UP HERE IS IT YES VICKY IT IS 
BUT IT'S BECAUSE THIS IS THE BEST PLACE TO OBSERVE THE SUN 
BUT YOU SEE WE DON'T USE IT NOW WE HAVEN'T USED IT FOR A LONG TIME 
BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE'S NO SUNSHINE TO MEASURE I WAS BEGINNING TO WONDER IT'S SO DARK YES 
IT'S THE DARK TIME OF THE YEAR FOR MORE THAN EIGHT WEEKS WE HAVEN'T HAD A SUNRISE WE HAVE DARKNESS 
WOW OR TWILIGHT A FEW HOURS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY 
IN TROMSO IN WINTER 
THE NIGHTS SEEM TO LAST FOREVER 
THE SUN NEVER RISES 
BUT JUST BEFORE MIDDAY 
A FAINT GOLDEN GLOW CAN BE SEEN IN THE SKY 
THEN BY TWO O'CLOCK 
IT'S DARK AGAIN 
WHEN IT'S NOT LIGHT 
WEAR SOMETHING BRIGHT 
PUT IT ON YOUR LEFT 
PUT IT ON YOUR RIGHT 
GET SEEN BY TRAFFIC 
MORNING AND NIGHT
