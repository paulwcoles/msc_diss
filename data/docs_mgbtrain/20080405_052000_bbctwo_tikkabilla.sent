WE'VE FINISHED 
OH I HAVEN'T QUITE FINISHED 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A DOOR IN MY BLOCK OF FLATS JUST YET 
COME WITH ME AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE YOUR DOOR 
NOW OVER HERE 
I'VE CUT OUT A NICE RED DOOR SHAPE 
IT'S A LOVELY COLOUR A BIT LIKE THE TIKKABILLA DOOR 
I'M PUTTING GLUE ALL AROUND THE BACK OF THIS 
THEN I'M GOING TO STICK IT TO THE BOTTOM 
OF THESE TWO BOXES 
HEY LOOK AT THAT LOVELY RED DOOR 
I'M ALSO GOING TO ADD A COUPLE OF WINDOWS 
TWO OF MY BLUE SQUARES OF PAPER 
ONE HERE

THERE WE ARE MAKE SURE IT'S NICE AND FIRM 
ONE WINDOW 
TWO WINDOWS 
AND THERE WE HAVE OUR LOVELY BLOCK OF FLATS 
WOW IT'S SO HIGH 
THERE ARE MORE BIG BUILDINGS THROUGH THE WINDOWS TODAY 
AND SOME ANIMALS WHO LIVE NEAR THEM LET'S SEE 
HOW MANY WINDOWS 
ONE TWO THREE 
ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED 
WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
IT'S THE SQUARE WINDOW 
DO YOU LIVE IN A CITY 
CITIES ARE FULL OF LOTS AND LOTS OF PEOPLE 
DID YOU KNOW THAT LOTS OF ANIMALS LIVE IN CITIES TOO 
THESE ARE PIGEONS 
PIGEONS ARE VERY COMMON BIRDS 
WHICH MEANS THAT YOU SEE LOTS OF THEM QUITE OFTEN 
ESPECIALLY IN CITIES 
SOMETIMES BIGGER BIRDS CALLED FALCONS 
TRY TO CATCH PIGEONS FOR SUPPER 
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE IN CITIES 
THEY MAKE LOTS AND LOTS OF RUBBISH 
SOME ANIMALS FIND OUR RUBBISH VERY TASTY 
THIS IS A RAT AND IT HAS SNIFFED OUT SOME TASTY LEFTOVERS IN THE BIN 
BUT IT HAD BETTER WATCH OUT 
THERE'S ANOTHER ANIMAL LOOKING FOR FOOD IT'S A FOX 
FOXES LIKE LIFE IN THE BIG CITY AS WELL 
AND THEY COME IN TO LOOK FOR FOOD AT NIGHT 
HERE'S ANOTHER ANIMAL WHICH SOMETIMES COMES INTO THE CITY 
ESPECIALLY INTO BACK GARDENS 
THIS PERSON HAS LEFT SOME FOOD OUT FOR THESE BADGERS 
SO THEY COME HERE QUITE OFTEN FOR A TASTY TREAT 
SOME ANIMALS DON'T JUST COME LOOKING FOR FOOD IN THE CITY 
THEY LIVE THERE 
THESE ANIMALS ARE CALLED RACCOONS 
AND THEY LIVE IN SOME CITIES IN AMERICA 
A NICE COSY ATTIC MAKES THE IDEAL HOME FOR THEM 
IF THEY CAN'T GET INTO THE ROOF 
THEN THEY'LL HAPPILY SETTLE FOR THE CHIMNEY 
IN SOME CITIES THERE ARE BIG PARKS 
PARKS ARE THE BEST PLACES OF ALL TO SEE ANIMALS IN THE CITY 
ISN'T IT AMAZING HOW MANY DIFFERENT ANIMALS 
CAN LIVE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY 
IF YOU LIVE IN A CITY SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT ANY ANIMALS 
OR MAYBE YOU LIVE HIGH UP IN A BLOCK OF FLATS 
OH

IT'S A LIGHTHOUSE 
AND TODAY'S STORY IS CALLED LILY AND THE MAGICAL MOONBEAM 
PERCHED ON A ROCKY REEF BESIDE THE SALTY SEA STOOD A LIGHTHOUSE 
INSIDE LIVED LILY THE LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER AND HER LITTLE DOG ANGUS 
LOOKING AFTER THE LIGHTHOUSE WAS BUSY WORK 
EVERY DAY LILY SKIPPED UP AND DOWN THE TOWER 
POLISH THE LAMP SHE HUFFED 
SOUND THE FOGHORN SHE PUFFED 
FEED THE SEAGULLS OH SHE PANTED 
WOOF WOOF BARKED ANGUS 
WHEN DARKNESS FELL LILY TURNED ON THE LIGHTHOUSE LAMP 
TO GUIDE THE FISHING BOATS AROUND THE ROCKY REEF 
ONE DARK NIGHT WHEN THE WIND HOWLED AROUND THE LIGHTHOUSE 
LILY HEARD A SPLASH 
HELP CRIED A LITTLE VOICE 
LILY THREW A LIFEBELT INTO THE WAVES AND PULLED IT HARD 
THERE ALL SHIVERING AND WET 
LAY A POOR SOGGY CREATURE 
WHO ARE YOU ASKED LILY 
I AM A MAGICAL MOONBEAM CROAKED A TINY VOICE 
THE WIND WAS SO STRONG 
THAT IT BLEW ME OUT OF THE SKY 
ANGUS FETCHED A SOFT FLUFFY TOWEL 
DON'T WORRY YOU'RE SAFE NOW LITTLE MOONBEAM LILY SAID 
THE MOONBEAM BEGAN TO GLOW 
TIME TO START WORK SAID LILY THE NEXT MORNING 
CAN I HELP ASKED THE MOONBEAM 
SO UP AND DOWN THE TOWER THEY SKIPPED 
POLISH THE LAMP THEY HUFFED 
SOUND THE FOGHORN THEY PUFFED 
FEED THE SEAGULLS THEY PANTED 
WOOF WOOF BARKED ANGUS 
WHEN IT GREW DARK 
LILY AND THE MOONBEAM TURNED ON THE LIGHTHOUSE LAMP 
OH WHAT A LOVELY NIGHT SAID LILY 
LOOK AT ALL THOSE STARS 
THEY'RE MY TWINKLY FRIENDS SMILED THE MOONBEAM 
AND HE REMEMBERED HOW HE USED TO GLISTEN AND GLOW BESIDE THEM 
LILY LOVED HAVING THE MAGICAL MOONBEAM IN THE LIGHTHOUSE 
SHE HAD MOONLIT SUPPERS 
HAD MOONLIT BATHS AND AT BEDTIME 
THE MOONBEAM GLOWED ABOVE HER PILLOW 
THE MAGICAL MOONBEAM LOVED BEING WITH LILY TOO 
BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN HE WOULD GAZE UP INTO THE NIGHT SKY 
AND THINK OF HOME 
ONE DAY LILY NOTICED THAT THE MOONBEAM WASN'T GLOWING 
AS BRIGHTLY AS USUAL 
WHAT'S THE MATTER LILY ASKED 
I MISS MY FRIENDS SAID THE MOONBEAM SADLY 
I THINK IT'S TIME I WENT HOME 
LILY DIDN'T WANT TO SAY GOODBYE 
OH PLEASE STAY A LITTLE LONGER SHE SAID 
THE MAGICAL MOONBEAM'S LIGHT WAS BEGINNING TO FLICKER AND FADE 
LILY KNEW THAT SHE HAD TO DO SOMETHING 
BUT HOW COULD SHE HELP HER FRIEND 
WOOF WOOF BARKED ANGUS 
HE HAD SPOTTED SOME SEAGULLS 
GOOD IDEA ANGUS SAID LILY 
CAN YOU HELP US LILY CALLED TO THE SEAGULLS 
BUT WITH A SCREECH AND A SQUAWK THEY SKIMMED OUT OF SIGHT 
LILY LOOKED DOWN AT THE MOONBEAM 
HIS LAST LITTLE GLIMMER HAD ALMOST GONE 
MY POOR MAGICAL MOONBEAM SHE WHISPERED 
JUST THEN LILY HEARD SOMETHING 
SCREECHING AND SQUAWKING 
A WHOLE FLOCK OF SEAGULLS SWOOPED DOWN TO THE RESCUE 
GENTLY LILY PUT THE MOONBEAM IN HER BUCKET 
GOODBYE MY LITTLE MOONBEAM SHE SAID SOFTLY 
THEN THE SEAGULLS LIFTED THE MOONBEAM UP INTO THE STARRY SKY 
HIGHER AND HIGHER THEY FLEW 
UNTIL AT LAST THE MAGICAL MOONBEAM WAS BACK WITH HIS TWINKLY FRIENDS 
LILY MISSED HAVING HER MAGICAL FRIEND IN THE LIGHTHOUSE 
SLOWLY SHE TRUDGED UP AND DOWN THE TOWER 
POLISH THE LAMP 
SOUND THE FOGHORN 
FEED THE SEAGULLS 
THAT NIGHT A GREAT STORM RAGED AROUND THE ROCKY REEF 
THE WHISTLING WIND AND CRASHING WAVES KEPT LILY AWAKE 
IF ONLY MY MAGICAL MOONBEAM WAS HERE SHE THOUGHT 
THEN SUDDENLY THE LIGHTHOUSE WENT DARK 
OH NO CRIED LILY THE LAMP'S BROKEN 
NOW THE FISHING BOATS ARE IN DANGER 
IN THE DARKNESS SHE HUGGED ANGUS WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO 
ALL AT ONCE THE DARKNESS VANISHED 
AND A BRIGHT LIGHT SWEPT OVER THE SEA 
ABOVE THE LIGHTHOUSE GLOWING BRIGHTER THAN EVER 
SHONE LILY'S MAGICAL MOONBEAM 
WOOF WOOF BARKED ANGUS 
NOW EVERYONE'S SAFE CRIED LILY 
THANK YOU MAGICAL MOONBEAM 
THE MOONBEAM GLOWED BRIGHTER STILL 
YOU'RE WELCOME HE SAID 
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR 
AT LAST THE STORM BLEW OVER AND LILY SNUGGLED DOWN IN HER BED 
GOODNIGHT ANGUS GOODNIGHT MAGICAL MOONBEAM SHE WHISPERED
