THIS CITY HAS BEEN VOTED BEST PLACE TO STAY IN THE U. K. 
AFTER LONDON IT'S THE COUNTRY'S MOST POPULAR VISITOR DESTINATION 
THIRTY MILLION PEOPLE COME HERE EVERY YEAR AND ALMOST ALL OF THEM COME FOR JUST ONE STREET 
TONIGHT ON A WALK DOWN EDINBURGH'S ANCIENT ROYAL MILE 
WE MEET THE MAN WHO KEEPS THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT IN ORDER 
ORDER 
HEAR ABOUT THE LEGACY OF SCOTLAND'S MOST FAMOUS DOG 
AND LORD DAVID STEEL REVEALS THE TRAGIC HISTORY 
OF ONE OF HIS ANCESTORS 
WE'RE RIGHT IN THE VERY OLDEST PART OF EDINBURGH THE ROYAL MILE 
FROM EDINBURGH CASTLE AT THE TOP WHICH DOMINATES THE CITY FROM ALMOST EVERY ANGLE 
IT RUNS RIGHT DOWN FOR A MILE TO THE ROYAL PALACE OF HOLYROODHOUSE 
DURING AUGUST EVERY YEAR IT'S THE HEART OF THE FESTIVAL 
AND EVEN WHEN THAT MADNESS SUBSIDES IT'S STILL A MAGNET FOR TOURISTS 
JUST BEYOND THE ROYAL MILE 
ON LAND ORIGINALLY GIVEN TO THE CITY MANY CENTURIES AGO BY MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS 
IS THE OLD GREYFRIARS KIRK 
IT'S HERE WE'VE COME FOR TONIGHT'S SONGS OF PRAISE 
IT'S PROBABLY TYPICAL OF OUR SENTIMENTAL AGE 
THAT IN A CHURCHYARD CRAMMED FULL OF EDINBURGH'S ILLUSTRIOUS CITIZENS 
THE MOST FAMOUS RESIDENT OF ALL IS A DOG 
THE DOG IN QUESTION WAS GREYFRIARS BOBBY WHO SAT FAITHFULLY ON HIS MASTER'S GRAVE FOR FOURTEEN YEARS 
HE SHOULD'VE BEEN PUT DOWN AS A STRAY 
BUT INSTEAD WON THE HEARTS OF EDINBURGH CITIZENS 
INCLUDING THE LORD PROVOST WHO PAID FOR HIS DOG LICENCE 
WHEN OLD BOBBY DIED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO 
A WEALTHY EDINBURGH WORTHY BARONESS BURDETT COUTTS PAID FOR A STATUE OF HIM 
IT'S BECOME ONE OF THE MOST PHOTOGRAPHED STATUES IN SCOTLAND 
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE 
THE GOOD BARONESS WAS ONE OF MANY EARLY SUPPORTERS 
OF THE SCOTTISH SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS 
TODAY THE SOCIETY EMPLOYS FIFTY INSPECTORS ACROSS SCOTLAND 
BILLY LINTON IS ONE OF THEM 
IT WAS SOME THIRTY YEARS BEFORE GREYFRIARS BOBBY THAT THE SOCIETY WAS FOUNDED 
THE ROLE IS TO PREVENT CRUELTY TO ANIMALS 
AND ENCOURAGE KINDNESS AND HUMANITY IN THEIR TREATMENT 
AS WELL AS DEALING WITH CRUELTY THE S. S. P. C. A. REHOMES TODAY'S STRAYS 
AND CARES FOR WILD ANIMALS IN TROUBLE 
SINCE AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER I'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN WILDLIFE 
PARTICULARLY SCOTTISH WILDLIFE 
AND THROUGHOUT MY WORKING LIFE I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN ANIMALS 
BILLY THINKS THE SWAN HAS EATEN SOMETHING 
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE AND HAS TAKEN IT TO THE VET 
SO PRETTY MUCH WE TOOK SOME X. RAYS OF THE SWAN 
BECAUSE WE SUSPECTED IT HAD LEAD POISONING 
BUT SADLY OFTEN THERE ARE MORE DISTRESSING CASES TO DEAL WITH 
YOU CAN HAVE VERY HARD DAYS' 
YOU GO ALONG TO AN ANIMAL NEGLECT AND YOU CAN SEE NEGLECT THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE 
THROUGHOUT THE FAMILY 
THE ANIMAL IS IN A SITUATION WHERE IT MAYBE SHOULD NOT BE 
AND YOU COULD BE TELLING PEOPLE THAT THE HOUSE IS MAYBE NOT FIT FOR ANIMALS TO BE IN 
BUT YOU'RE QUITE SAFE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU CAN TAKE THE ANIMAL OUT OF THAT SITUATION 
WHAT IS EVERYBODY SAYING WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS THAT 
WHAT IS THAT EH 
THIS IS KAYA A FEMALE AKITA SHE'S HERE AS AN ABANDONMENT 
SHE WAS ABANDONED BY HER OWNER SHE'S SETTLED DOWN QUITE WELL 
VERY FRIENDLY DOG LOOKING FOR A HOME AT THE MOMENT 
WHEN YOU'RE INVOLVED IN RESCUES WHETHER IT'S A SWAN 
THAT'S BEEN PARTIALLY INJURED IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE IT TAKING OFF 
AT THAT POINT WHEN YOU SEE THAT YOU KNOW THEY ARE GOD'S CREATURES 
AND WE ARE ALL PART OF GOD'S CREATION 
THE HIGH KIRK OF SAINT GILES IS VERY MUCH AT THE HEART OF SCOTLAND'S CEREMONIAL 
BUT IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN THAT FORMAL DIGNITY WAS DISRUPTED 
WHEN A STOOL WAS THROWN AT THE MINISTER AND THE CONGREGATION RIOTED 
THEY WERE FURIOUS BECAUSE KING CHARLES I HAD FORCED THEM TO HAVE PRAYERS READ FROM A BOOK 
INSTEAD OF PRAYING SPONTANEOUSLY 
IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT JUST A YEAR LATER 
A HUGE CROWD GATHERED IN THIS KIRKYARD OF GREYFRIARS 
TO SIGN WHAT WAS CALLED THE NATIONAL COVENANT 
IN PROTEST AGAINST THE KING'S ATTEMPTS TO IMPOSE ANGLICANISM ON SCOTLAND 
ONE OF THEM WAS DAVID STEEL AN ANCESTOR OF LORD DAVID STEEL 
FORMER LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER 
SO THEY SIGNED THE COVENANT HERE 
IN THE KIRK AND THAT'S HOW THEY BECAME KNOWN 
AS THE COVENANTERS AND KING CHARLES 
OF COURSE REGARDED THAT AS A POLITICAL REBELLION AGAINST HIS AUTHORITY 
THAT'S WHY HE SENT IN THE TROOPS AGAINST THE SCOTS 
THE COVENANTERS RESISTED SUCCESSFULLY FOR A WHILE 
EVEN CAPTURING THIS IMPREGNABLE SYMBOL OF POWER IN SCOTLAND 
EDINBURGH CASTLE IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY NINE 
SO THEY THOUGHT IN THE EARLY SIXTEEN HUNDREDS THEY REALLY HAD WON THE RIGHT TO WORSHIP AS THEY WISHED 
BUT THE TIDE TURNED AND THE KING REGAINED THE INITIATIVE 
HE REGARDED PRESBYTERIANISM AS NO RELIGION FOR GENTLEMEN 
AND THE COVENANTERS AS GUILTY OF HIGH TREASON 
THROWN OUT OF THEIR CHURCHES THE COVENANTERS MET FOR WORSHIP 
IN SECRET OUTDOOR LOCATIONS 
PROTECTED BY ARMED GUARDS 
BUT IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE THEY WERE ROUNDLY DEFEATED 
AT THE BATTLE OF BOTHWELL BRIG 
AND ONE THOUSAND OF THEM WERE IMPRISONED HERE IN GREYFRIARS KIRKYARD 
IN THE OPEN AIR 
ONE OF THE PEOPLE AT THE BATTLE WAS MY ANCESTOR DAVID STEEL 
HE ESCAPED AND HE WAS IN HIDING FOR FIVE YEARS 
AND THEN WHEN HE WENT BACK TO VISIT HIS FAMILY 
HE WAS SPOTTED AND HE WAS ACTUALLY SHOT IN FRONT OF HIS WIFE AND CHILD 
SO IT'S A SEMINAL PART OF SCOTTISH HISTORY 
I THINK IT'S GOT TWO LESSONS FOR US TODAY 
ONE IS THAT IT SHOWS US THE COURAGE OF PEOPLE WITH REAL CONVICTION 
BUT IT ALSO SHOWS US THE DANGER OF PEOPLE ACTING AS THOUGH THEY ALONE HAD GOD ON THEIR SIDE 
A FEW HUNDRED YARDS FURTHER DOWN THE ROYAL MILE IS THE ANCIENT CANONGATE KIRK 
PARISH CHURCH OF THE PALACE OF HOLYROODHOUSE 
THE QUEEN'S OFFICIAL RESIDENCE IN SCOTLAND 
AND BURIED IN ITS CHURCHYARD IS THE PROLIFIC EDINBURGH HYMN WRITER HORATIUS BONAR 
THIS NEXT HYMN SET TO AN OLD FOLK TUNE IS ONE OF HIS 
FOUR CENTURIES AGO WHEN THE RESIDENTS OF THE ROYAL MILE 
WENT TO CHURCH THEY'D HAVE SUNG NOT SONGS OR HYMNS BUT PSALMS 
THAT PSALM SINGING TRADITION'S BEEN REFRESHED FOR NEW GENERATIONS 
BY NEW TRANSLATIONS ONE OF WHICH IS SUNG FOR US NOW 
BY NEW SCOTTISH 
WERE I TO CROSS FROM LAND TO LAND 
OR SAIL AFAR BY SEA 
DESCEND THE DEPTHS OR CLIMB THE HEIGHTS 
MY LORD REMAINS WITH ME 
BEFORE THE BLOOD RAN IN THESE VEINS 
THE DAYS ORDAINED FOR ME 
WERE WRITTEN IN YOUR BOOK O. LORD 
BEFORE I CAME TO BE 
I GRIEVE TO HEAR YOUR ENEMIES 
SPEAK HATRED LORD OF YOU 
LONG THOUGH THEY SCHEME WITH ILL INTENT 
THEIR DAYS ARE NUMBERED TOO 
HOW PRECIOUS ARE YOUR THOUGHTS TO ME 
AND COUNTLESS LORD THEY ARE 
MORE THAN THE SHORES HAVE GRAINS OF SAND 
MORE THAN THE SKIES HAVE STARS 
COME SEARCH AND TEST THIS HEART O. LORD 
DISPEL EACH ANXIOUS THOUGHT 
AND LEAD ME ONWARD EVERMORE 
TO TREAD THE PATH I OUGHT 
HOW BLESSED AM I SO BOUND WITH LOVE 
SURROUNDED YET SO FREE 
IN DOUBT OR BLESSING LIFE OR DEATH 
MY LORD REMAINS WITH ME 
IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE OLD BUILDINGS OF THE ROYAL MILE 
THE STUNNING ARCHITECTURE OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PARLIAMENT BUILDING 
IS A SYMBOL OF A NEW AGE 
WHERE DIFFERENCES ARE HAMMERED OUT WITH WORDS RATHER THAN SWORDS 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MEMBERS OF THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT MEET HERE 
AND ARE RESPONSIBLE AMONG OTHER THINGS FOR SCOTLAND'S HEALTH 
EDUCATION AND LAW AND ORDER 
ALEX FERGUSSON IS THE PRESIDING OFFICER THE PARLIAMENT'S EQUIVALENT 
OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS' SPEAKER 
AS A PARLIAMENT WE HAVE TRIED TO BE VERY OPEN 
AND ENGAGE WITH ALL THOUGHTS 
AND ALL PHILOSOPHIES 
IN TRYING TO BRING 
A BALANCE OF UNDERSTANDING TO THE DECISIONS WE MAKE 
GOOD AFTERNOON THE FIRST ITEM OF BUSINESS THIS AFTERNOON IS TIME FOR REFLECTION 
I'M PLEASED TO WELCOME THE RIGHT REV SHEILAGH KESTING 
MODERATOR OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND 
WHEN JOHN THE BAPTIST WAS IN PRISON 
A REGULAR ROUTINE IN THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT IS TIME FOR REFLECTION 
WHERE SPEAKERS COME FROM ALL FAITHS 
LEADER WHO WOULD BRING IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD ON EARTH 
THERE WAS A VIEW THAT THIS SHOULD BE PURELY PRESBYTERIAN GIVEN THE FACT WE'RE IN SCOTLAND 
THERE WAS A WIDER VIEW THAT IT SHOULD BE PURELY CHRISTIAN 
BUT I TOOK THE VIEW AND INDEED PARLIAMENT EVENTUALLY AGREED 
THAT THIS SHOULD BE MORE WIDE RANGING WITH A BRAND NEW PARLIAMENT THERE SHOULD BE A BRAND NEW WAY 
OF LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHIES AND BELIEFS AND INFLUENCES ON OUR LIVES 
MAY ALL BE HAPPY THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
MY FATHER WAS A MINISTER IN THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND IN THE SECOND HALF OF HIS LIFE 
AND I WAS BROUGHT UP IN A MANSE IN A SMALL RURAL CHARGE PARISH IN SOUTH AYRSHIRE 
AND THEREFORE THE CHRISTIAN INFLUENCE 
AND BEING PART OF A CHRISTIAN HOUSEHOLD AND A CHURCH GOING EXISTENCE 
BECAME VERY MUCH PART OF MY LIFE AND STILL IS 
LIKE ALMOST EVERYBODY I HAVE ENORMOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT MY FAITH THAT I WOULD LOVE TO GET ANSWERED 
BUT THAT'S WHAT FAITH IS ALL ABOUT 
MAXIMISE SCOTLAND'S ENERGY MIX AND ENERGY SECURITY 
THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF GENERAL QUESTIONS AND WE WILL MOVE NOW TO FIRST MINISTER'S QUESTIONS 
QUESTION NUMBER ONE WENDY ALEXANDER 
IN TERMS OF HOW MY BACKGROUND AND MY FAITH AFFECTS HOW I ACT AS PRESIDING OFFICER 
I'M ALWAYS VERY MINDFUL OF THE WORDS OF THE LATE LORD MUNRO 
WHO WHEN ASKED THIS QUESTION ALWAYS SAID 
THAT HE HOPED THAT HE ALWAYS KNEW THE RIGHT DECISION TO TAKE 
IN ANY PARLIAMENTARY DECISION HE WAS HAVING TO TAKE 
BUT WHEN AND IF HE WAS IN DOUBT 
HE ALWAYS TRIED TO BRING A CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVE TO THAT DECISION MAKING PROCESS 
I THINK THOSE ARE WONDERFUL WORDS AND I TRY TO REFLECT THAT IN HOW I GO ABOUT MY DUTIES AS PRESIDING OFFICER 
HERE WE ARE NOW AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE ROYAL MILE 
THIS IS THE PALACE OF HOLYROODHOUSE WHERE THE QUEEN STAYS WHEN SHE'S IN TOWN 
AROUND FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO ANOTHER QUEEN LIVED HERE MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS 
AND IT WAS AROUND THAT TIME THAT IN ENGLAND THOMAS TALLIS WAS COMPOSING HIS FAMOUS CANON 
GOD GRANT WE GRACE

ALL GENTILES SPY 
THE ERIC LIDDELL CENTRE IS A CONVERTED CHURCH RUN IN HONOUR 
OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALLIST ERIC LIDDELL 
BUT IT'S NOT SO MUCH HIS ATHLETIC SKILL THAT'S INSPIRED THE WORK HERE 
BUT RATHER HIS SELFLESS EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF THE VERY NEEDIEST PEOPLE AS A MISSIONARY IN CHINA 
THE BUILDING WHICH HONOURS HIS MEMORY IS A COMMUNITY RESOURCE 
FOR A VARIETY OF PEOPLE INCLUDING THOSE WHO LIKE ANNE CRAIGEN CARE FOR LOVED ONES 
MY SON HAD PROBLEMS AT SCHOOL 
HE WAS A TEENAGER AND HE SEEMED TO BE HAVING DIFFICULTIES 
AND THEN HE BECAME QUITE WITHDRAWN 
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY TROUBLED 
PLAYED REALLY LOUD MUSIC AND STAYED IN HIS ROOM A LOT WHICH YOU WOULD THINK WAS QUITE NORMAL 
BUT HE SAID LATER THAT HE WAS HEARING VOICES AND THE MUSIC WAS TO DROWN THEM OUT 
ANNE'S SON NEIL WAS DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA 
IT WAS DEVASTATING BECAUSE AT TIMES HE ALMOST DIDN'T KNOW ME 
HE WAS SO DISTANT BUT THAT WAS THE ILLNESS IT WASN'T HIM 
YOU KNOW HE SEEMED TO BE SOMEBODY DIFFERENT 
AND THERE WAS A CONSTANT SENSE OF GRIEF THAT I'D LOST THE CHILD THAT I'D BROUGHT UP 
I WAS A CHRISTIAN THEN AND OF COURSE I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND 
WHY GOD HAD ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN 
I HAD NO SOCIAL LIFE TO END UP WITH AND I'D LOST CONTACT WITH THE CHURCH I'D BEEN IN 
AND I WAS REALLY QUITE ISOLATED 
I FOUND IT REALLY HARD TO PRAY BUT I DID KNOW THAT GOD WAS STILL CARING FOR NEIL AND CARING FOR ME 
BUT I MOVED TO THIS PART OF EDINBURGH THREE YEARS AGO 
AND I DISCOVERED THE CARE PROJECT 
THE CARE PROJECT PROVIDES A LISTENING EAR AND MUTUAL SUPPORT 
FOR THOSE WHOSE LIVES ARE DOMINATED BY LOOKING AFTER THEIR LOVED ONES 
ANNE NOW WORKS AS ONE OF ITS COORDINATORS 
I GOT OFF THE TWENTY THREE 
IT GAVE ME WONDERFUL HOPE AND GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT 
BECAUSE I MET SO MANY NICE PEOPLE LOVELY PEOPLE 
AND I FOUND GRADUALLY MY CONFIDENCE WAS COMING BACK 
AND NOW I REALISE LOOKING BACK 
THAT GOD WAS WITH ME ALL THE TIME EVEN AT THE REALLY DARK TIMES 
HE WAS THERE AND HE WAS WORKING IN ME AND CHANGING ME AND HELPING ME TO COPE 
ALTHOUGH I COULDN'T ALWAYS SEE IT AT THE TIME HE WAS ALWAYS THERE 
HOW IS YOUR SON NOW 
HE'S HE'S REASONABLY REASONABLE AT THE MOMENT 
HE'S HE'S QUITE SETTLED AND HE'S DOING QUITE WELL 
THE LORD MAKE HIS FACE TO SHINE UPON YOU 
TO SHINE UPON YOU AND BE GRACIOUS 
AND BE GRACIOUS UNTO YOU 
THE LORD BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU 
THE LORD MAKE HIS FACE TO SHINE UPON YOU 
TO SHINE UPON YOU AND BE GRACIOUS 
AND BE GRACIOUS UNTO YOU 
THE LORD LIFT UP THE LIGHT 
OF HIS COUNTENANCE UPON YOU 
THE LORD LIFT UP THE LIGHT 
OF HIS COUNTENANCE UPON YOU 
AND GIVE YOU PEACE 
AND GIVE YOU PEACE 
AND GIVE YOU PEACE 
AND GIVE YOU PEACE 
A A A A AMEN 
A A A A AMEN 
A A A A AMEN 
A A A AMEN 
A MEN 
A A A A AMEN 
A AMEN 
GOD GIVE US GRACE TO ACCEPT WITH SERENITY THE THINGS THAT CANNOT BE CHANGED 
COURAGE TO CHANGE THE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE CHANGED 
AND THE WISDOM TO DISTINGUISH THE ONE FROM THE OTHER 
MAY YOU REJOICE ALWAYS IN THE GOODNESS OF YOUR MAKER 
MAY CHRIST JESUS BE YOUR ABIDING COMPANION AND FRIEND 
AND MAY THE SPIRIT OF GOD FILL YOUR HEARTS WITH JOY AND PEACE 
AMEN 
LOOK I KNOW IT'S FULL OF KITSCH BUT I LOVE THE ROYAL MILE 
THE STONES JUST BREATHE HISTORY 
AND IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CITY IN THE WORLD
