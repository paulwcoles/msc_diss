CAN'T BE BEHIND OVERNIGHT IF HE

WOULD BE PUSHING IN 
THE LAST FRAME 
OF 
THE DAY FOR A NINE TO SEVEN OVERNIGHT LEAD THE FIRST SESSION THIS 
THINK EVERYBODY WAS 
THINK EVERYBODY WAS FEARING THE WORST A 
LOT OF BALLS WERE BEING 
MISSED AND IT SEEMED TO BE 
MISSED AND IT SEEMED TO BE A LONG PROTRACTED SAFETY 
BATTLE BUT SINCE 
THEN WE HAVE 
THEN WE HAVE HAD SOME SUPERB SNOOKER FROM BOTH

CAME FROM CARTER 
WE HAVE 
HAD A 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY THREE AND EIGHTY FOUR 
AND 
FROM EBDON

FROM EBDON SEVENTY NINE AND EIGHTY ONE FROM CARTER BUT IN BETWEEN ALL THOSE 
SOME TACTICAL PLAY SOME SEARCHING 
FOR OPENINGS AND SOME 
THAT ADDS TO THE FUN FOR US

YOU FORGET 
ABOUT THE MAXIMUM 
HE 
YOU FORGET ABOUT THE MAXIMUM HE MIGHT WELL TAKE IT BECAUSE IT IS 
WINNING THAT'S OF PRIME IMPORTANCE

IF HE DOES 
GET TO 
A 
SEVENTY THREE WITH REDS 
AND BLACKS YOU 
COULD BET HE 
WOULD 
AND BLACKS YOU COULD BET HE WOULD BE GOING FOR THE MAXIMUM 
A LITTLE BIT SHORT IN TERMS OF 
RETAINING 
BLACK BALL POSITION 
OR 
RETAINING BLACK BALL POSITION OR RIGHT DEAL BLACK BALL POSITION 
OR IDEAL BLACK BALL POSITION HE 
HAS HAD A GOOD LOOK AT THAT PLANT 
THAT HAS IMPROVED HIS CHANCES 
ALTHOUGH HE 
IS A 
LITTLE LOW ON THE 
ALTHOUGH HE IS A LITTLE LOW ON THE BLACK 
EAST HE ON THE RED THE TO 
US IN THE 
LEFT CORNER 
IS HE 
ON THE 
RED HE HAS WALKED

A GOOD SOLID POT PERFECT ANGLE ON 
THE BROWN 
COMMENTARY BY DENNIS TAYLOR AND 
JOHN PARROTT 
IF HE CAN SCREW THIS BACK IN A 
STRAIGHT LINE AND AVOID THE BLUE 
STEPHEN JUST CHECKING TO SEE IF THE 
BLACK IS AVAILABLE IT LOOKS LIKE 
IT IS OBVIOUSLY IT DOES GO 
TWENTY EIGHT POINTS IS THE DIFFERENCE 
ANOTHER THREE REDS AVAILABLE CAN 
YOU BELIEVE THAT 
THE BLACK JUST HAMPERING HIM BUT 
ONLY SLIGHTLY THAT WAS EXETER HE 
MISSED THAT WAS AN EASY POT HE 
MISSED 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER RYAN HAS GOT 
TO PLAY THE SHOT TO GET THE RE IN 
TO GET THE GREEN AND THE REDS OUT 
HE IS ON A RED IF HE CAN POT THIS 
ONE SCREW BACK AND LEAVE HIMSELF 
ON THE GREEN NOT A BAD CHANCE A 
COUPLE OF SHOTS TO GET RIGHT THAT 
WAS THE FIRST ONE SLIGHTLY OR 
SCREW BACK MADE IT A LITTLE MORE 
DIFFICULT 
THAT IS VERY POOR THAT WAS A GOOD 
CHANCE ONCE YOU PUT THEM ON TO 
THAT MEIR JOLT YOU HAVE NO CHANCE 
THAT PART OF THE POCKET YOU 
ANOTHER CHANCE NO CHANCE 
HE LOST THE LAST THREE FRAMES BUT 
STEPHEN HENDRY IS BACK ON TRACK A 
BREAK OF FIFTY FOUR HELPED HIM TO TAKE THE 
FRAME HE NOW LEADS BY NINE TO FOUR 
STEPHEN LOOKING VERY RELAXED HE IS 
THREE POINTS BEHIND IN THE NEXT 
FRAME FOUL AND A MISS 
A GOOD CHANCE JUST THE RED BUT AS 
NEXT TO THE PINK THAT COULD BE THE 
REAL PROBLEM THE RED THAT'S NEXT 
TO THE PINK 
HE PLAYED A LITTLE CANNON HE DIDN'T DO BY THE YELLOW BUT IT 
HAS COME FAR ENOUGH BACK UP THE 
TABLE TO GIVE HIMSELF TO GIVE HIM 
A CHANCE OF THAT RED INTO THE 
MIDDLE POCKET 
THERE IS STILL HOPE FOR RYAN DAY 
HE ONLY NEEDED MACKIE ALI ME THAT 
RED HE WAS ON THE BLACK HE ONLY 
NEEDED THAT RED 
JUST BACK INTO A BLIND POCKET YOU 
CANNOT SEE THE POCKET WHEN YOU 
BLIND SIDE MAC ONE WHO ARE BLIND 
SIDE ON THE YOU'RE BLIND SIDE 
HE HAD TO MAKE SURE OF THE YELLOW 
IF HE HAS GOT LITTLE BIT OF ANGLE 
HERE HE CAN DROP THE GREEN IN AM 
NOT SURE WHAT ANGLE HE HAS BUT HE 
WOULD LOVE TO GET THE WHITE 
SOMEWHERE NEAR THE CIRCLE HE CAN 
GET HIMSELF OR THE BLUE ONTO 
THE BLUE PLAYED INSIDE THE BLACK 
HE STILL NEEDS THE BLACK HE IS 
SEVEN IN FRONT 
STEPHEN HENDRY DID HAVE A CHANCE TO 
MAKE IT TEN TO FOUR RYAN DAY IN WITH A 
VERY TIMELY CLEARANCE HE HAS 
PULLED ONE FRAME BACK RYAN DAY 
WITH A VERY TIMELY CLEARANCE 
RYAN DAY IS ACTUALLY ONE FOUR OF 
THE SIX FRAMES THEY PLAYED THIS 
EVENING HE ESTABLISHED SIXTEEN POINT 
LEAD IN THIS IN THE NEXT IT IS 
HENDRY AT THE TABLE 
WHAT A GOOD POT THAT WAS EXCELLENT 
CUEING OFF THE CUSHION A VERY 
TIGHT ANGLE HE IS GOING TO TAKE ON 
THE BLUE 
WHY HE DID THAT HARD LOOK WHERE 
THE WHITE HAS FINISHED 
TENSION THERE US NO OTHER REASON 
IN THE WORLD BUT PENSION 
DENNIS HE HAS BEEN LUCKY AGAIN 
BECAUSE HE PLAYED SUCH A HARD SHOT 
HE IS HAVING A GOOD RUN OF LUCK HE CAN CHIP THIS IN PAST THE YELLOW 
TOO THIN THAT IS A BAD MISTAKE NO 
WAY HE SHOULD HAVE CANNONED INTO 
THE GREEN 
STEPHEN HAS TO GET FROM YELLOW ALL 
UP THE TABLE TO GREEN AND ALL THE 
WAY BACK DOWN THE TABLE TO BROWN 
WOULD YOU BE TEMPTED TO PLAY ON THE 
GREEN GREEN ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY POT THAT NO WE CANNOT BE ON THE 
YELLOW THERE IS NO WAY YOU 
CANNOT BE ON THE YELLOW 
RYAN DAY MIGHT JUST HAVE MISSED THE 
BOAT HERE HE HAD A GREAT CHANCE OF 
CLOSING DID JUST THREE BEHIND THE 
TO JUST THREE BEHIND 
BLUE AND PINK AFTER THE BROWN WOULD 
BE ENOUGH AND HE WILL BE PRETTY 
RELIEVED STEPHEN HENDRY 
RYAN DAY HAD THE CHANCE TO GET TO 
NINE TO NINE TO SIX THAT CLEARANCE FROM 
STEPHEN HENDRY WILL MAKE A MUCH 
MORE COMFORTABLE HE EXTENDS HIS 
LEAD LEAD IT LOOKS LIKE STEPHEN HENDRY COULD 
BE INCHING TOWARDS HIS TWELFTH 
APPEARANCE IN AT CRUCIBLE SEMI 
FINAL HOWEVER IN THE LAST FRAME 
OF THE SESSION RYAN DAY HAS IT ALL 
TO DO 
RYAN PLAYED THE SCREW SHOT THERE 
WHEN IT NEEDED TO BE A STUNT 
WESTON WESTON IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER STONE 
GREAT SHOT BEAUTIFULLY CUED 
STRAIGHT THROUGH THE BALL RIGHT IN 
THE CENTRE OF THE POCKET 
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF NOISE COMING 
FROM THE OTHER TABLE THERE IS 
STILL A LOT OF NOISE HE IS WELL 
USED TO IT HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE 
THIS TURN RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THE 
POCKET THIS TIME RIGHT IN THE 
HEART OF THE POCKET 
IT SHOULD BE PLAIN SAILING NOW FIFTY TWO 
AHEAD 
HE DESERVES TO WIN THIS FRAME AFTER 
THAT BIT OF A LONG RED AFTER 
THAT BEAUTIFUL LONG RED HE CAN 
TAKE THE PINK 
IF HE ROLLED THE BLUE IN HE WOULD 
ONLY BE FIFTY EIGHT AHEAD AND THERE FIFTY NINE ON 
THE TABLE THERE IS FIFTY NINE ON THE 
TABLE TABLE THAT WAS A BETTER SHOT THAN IT 
LOOKED JUST THIS RED REQUIRED 
IT HAS BEEN A STRUGGLE IN PARTS 
THIS EVENING STEPHEN IS MUTTERING 
TO HIMSELF SOMETHING OR OTHER OF 
THE AS HE IS CLEARING UP 
HE MISSED QUITE A FEW BUT RYAN TO 
BE FAIR DID NOT CAPITALISE 
IT HAS BEEN A FUNNY SESSION IT HAS 
NOT BEEN AT TYPICAL STEPHEN HENDRY 
SESSION RYAN HAD A FEW CHANCES A 
COUPLE OF FRAMES HE SHOULD HAVE WON 
BUT ALL CREDIT TO STEPHEN HERE AND 
THE LAST FRAME GOOD LEVELS OF 
CONCENTRATION 
WHEN YOU OPEN UP A GOOD LEAD IN THE 
OPENING SESSION IN YOU KNOW IF YOU 
CAN KEEP SHEERIN THE SESSIONS 
SHARING THE SESSIONS THERE IS NO 
WAY YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE HE IS 
GOING TO SHARE THIS SESSION FOUR 
FRAMES EACH RYAN DAY HAD LITTLE 
RUN OF FOUR FRIENDS AT A FIVE FOUR 
FRAMES AT OF FIVE 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT THIS WILL BE 
STEPHEN HENDRY'S HIGHEST BREAK IN 
THIS EVENING'S SESSION HE AND FIFTY FOUR 
IN FRAME TWELVE HE HAD FIFTY FOUR 
OVERALL STEPHEN HENDRY WILL BE 
DELIGHTED TO HAVE SHARED THIS 
SESSION FOR MARK GROW FRAMES EACH 
THAT BREAK OF SIXTY IT GIVES HIM AN 
OVERNIGHT LEAD OF ELEVEN FRAMES TO FIVE 
THERE WILL BE 
NOT TAKE TOO LONG 
BUT THERE AGAIN RYAN WILL HAVE 
DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT THAT LET ME
