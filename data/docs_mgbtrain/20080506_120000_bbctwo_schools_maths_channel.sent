MATHS CHANNEL THE CHANNEL YOU CAN COUNT ON 
THIS SHOW IS ABOUT READING SCALES 
WHEN WE MEASURE THINGS LIKE HOW TALL WE ARE HOW MUCH WE WEIGH 
HOW FAR WE CAN JUMP OR HOW MUCH MILK WE NEED FOR HOT CHOCOLATE 
WE OFTEN USE MEASURING EQUIPMENT 
WHATEVER EQUIPMENT WE USE WHETHER IT'S A RULER 
A MEASURING TAPE WEIGHING SCALES OR A JUG IT WILL HAVE A SCALE 
WITH MARKS AND NUMBERS THAT TELL US THE CORRECT HEIGHT WEIGHT 
LENGTH OR QUANTITY OF WHATEVER WE'RE MEASURING 
THESE CHILDREN ARE SEEING WHO CAN JUMP THE FURTHEST 
EACH COMPETITOR HAS TO JUMP FROM THE SAME PLACE 
AND JUMP AS FAR AS THEY CAN OVER THE WHITE LINE 
THIS GIRL MARKS WHERE THEY LANDED 
AND MEASURES HOW FAR THEY HAVE JUMPED OVER THE WHITE LINE 
START AT THE WHITE LINE MEASURE TO THE MARK IN THE SAND 
MAKE SURE THE SCALE IS STRAIGHT 
LINE UP YOUR EYE WITH THE SCALE AND READ THE ANSWER 
SO THE GIRL JUMPED SEVENTY C. M. OVER THE WHITE LINE 
SCALES CAN BE USED TO SHOW LARGER AMOUNTS 
HERE WE HAVE A SCALE TO SHOW HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS 
WENT TO SEE A FOOTBALL MATCH BUT ALL THOSE NUMBERS LOOK CRAMPED 
SO OFTEN SCALES SIMPLIFY THE NUMBERS LIKE THIS 
INSTEAD OF SAYING TEN THOUSAND TWENTY THOUSAND AND SO ON 
THE NUMBERS NOW SAY TEN TWENTY AND SO ON 
BUT THE LABEL TELLS US THAT THESE ARE THOUSANDS 
TEN THOUSAND TWENTY THOUSAND THIRTY THOUSAND 
FORTY THOUSAND FIFTY THOUSAND 
FIFTY THOUSAND SUPPORTERS AT A FOOTBALL MATCH 
SCALES ARE A BIT LIKE A NUMBER LINE 
NOT ALL SCALES LOOK THE SAME 
THE SCALE ON THIS MEASURING JUG IS STILL A NUMBER LINE 
ONLY NOW IT GOES UPWARDS INSTEAD OF ACROSS 
SO READING UP FROM THE BOTTOM 
HOW MANY MILLILITRES OF ORANGE JUICE IS THERE 
FIVE HUNDRED 
NOW HOW MANY MILLILITRES OF MILK 
READ UP FROM THE BOTTOM 
FOUR HUNDRED 
THIS CHEF IS NOW USING ANOTHER TYPE OF MEASURING SCALES 
IT'S CIRCULAR AND MARKED IN GRAMS AND KILOGRAMS AROUND THE EDGE 
AND MEASURES UP TO FIVE KILOGRAMS 
THE ARROW MOVES ROUND CLOCKWISE 
SAY WHEN IT GETS TO TWO KILOGRAMS 
YES THE SCALE READS TWO K. G. OF FLOUR 
MEASURING SCALES CAN HAVE THE NUMBERS AROUND THE EDGE OF A CIRCLE 
OR READ ALONG A STRAIGHT LINE 
BUT THEY'RE ALL REALLY DIFFERENT SORTS OF NUMBER LINES 
TODAY'S QUIZ IS ALL ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF SCALES 
OFF WE GO THEN OUR FIRST CONTESTANT KATE 
KATE ON THE LARGE SCREEN WE HAVE A SCALE STARTING AT ZERO 
AND FINISHING AT TEN WITH EQUAL STEPS IN BETWEEN 
WHAT NUMBER DOES THE RED LINE REACH ON THE SCALE 
I THINK THE RED LINE REACHES FIVE ON THE SCALE 
YES THAT'S RIGHT WELL DONE CAN YOU TELL US HOW YOU WORKED THAT OUT 
WELL I COUNTED THE NUMBER OF EQUAL STEPS 
FROM ZERO TO TEN AND THERE ARE TEN 
SO EACH STEP IS A STEP OF ONE 
THAT MEANS THE RED LINE GOES UP TO FIVE 
THAT'S RIGHT WELL DONE NOW OUR NEXT CONTESTANT CARLTON 
WE NOW HAVE THE SAME SCALE FROM ZERO TO TEN BUT WITH FEWER EQUAL STEPS 
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT NUMBER DOES THE RED LINE REACH THIS TIME 
THIS TIME THERE ARE ONLY FIVE EQUAL STEPS 
COMING FROM ZERO TO TEN 
SO EACH STEP MUST MEAN TWO 
WHICH MEANS THE RED LINE COMES UP TO FOUR THAT'S CORRECT WELL DONE 
O. K. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT DIFFERENT THINGS BEING MEASURED 
USING DIFFERENT TYPES OF SCALES 
O. K. KATE HOW MANY MILLILITRES OF LIQUID ARE THERE IN THIS JUG 
THE LEVEL OF THE LIQUID IS HALFWAY BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED 
IT'S TWO FIFTY M. L. 
YES YOU'RE RIGHT AGAIN WELL DONE 
NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ANOTHER TYPE OF SCALE 
O. K. SO CARLTON HOW MANY KILOGRAMS OF FLOUR ARE THERE ON THE SCALES 
THE HAND ON THE SCALES IS POINTING HALFWAY BETWEEN THE ONE AND THE TWO 
THERE IS FIFTEEN K. G. OF FLOUR ON THE WEIGHING SCALES 
YES RIGHT AGAIN WELL DONE 
LET'S SEE HOW FAR THESE CHILDREN HAVE JUMPED BEYOND THE WHITE LINE 
O. K. KATE HOW FAR HAS THE LONG JUMPER JUMPED BEYOND THE LINE 
WELL THE MARK IN THE SAND IS BETWEEN EIGHTY AND NINETY C. M. 
IT'S ONE MARK ON FROM EIGHTY ON THE SCALE 
SO I THINK THEY'VE JUMPED EIGHTY ONE C. M. 
CARLTON WHAT'S THE RIGHT ANSWER 
I'D SAY THE MARKER IS EXACTLY HALFWAY 
BETWEEN THE EIGHTY AND NINETY C. M. MARK 
SO THEY HAVE JUMPED EIGHTY FIVE C. M. 
YES THAT'S RIGHT WELL DONE 
WHAT A CLOSE RUN THING BUT TODAY CARLTON YOU'RE THE WINNER 
BLUE WHALE 
BLUE WHALE 
MEASURING THE SIZE OF THAT GREAT BLUE WHALE 
WHEN YOU MEASURE A WHALE 
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF PLUSES 
IT'S AS LONG AS A CLASS OF KIDS 
OF THREE BIG BUSES 
YOU'RE GONNA NEED A VERY LONG 
MEASURING SCALE 
TO MEASURE THE LENGTH 
OF THAT LONG BLUE WHALE 
THIRTY METRES 
BLUE WHALE 
BLUE WHALE 
MEASURING THE LENGTH OF THAT LONG BLUE WHALE 
THE WHALE EATS MILLIONS OF TINY CREATURES CALLED KRILL 
IT SUCKS THEM INTO ITS MOUTH IN HUGE MOUTHFULS 
HOW BIG A MOUTHFUL IS THAT EXACTLY 
WHAT IT EATS IS TINY 
BUT A WHALE'S A BIG EATER 
EVERY MOUTHFUL IT TAKES 
IS THOUSANDS OF LITRES 
YOU'LL BE NEEDING A JUG 
THAT REACHES THE SKY 
A MEASURING JUG 
SIX KILOMETRES HIGH 
ONE MOUTHFUL IS FORTY THOUSAND LITRES 
BLUE WHALE 
BLUE WHALE 
MEASURING A MOUTHFUL FOR THAT BIG BLUE WHALE 
IT'S EARTH'S HEAVIEST CREATURE 
SINCE LIFE HERE BEGAN 
YOU NEED TWENTY FIVE ELEPHANTS 
TO BALANCE THE PAN 
YOU'RE BETTER TO BE READY 
TO BUY SOME NEW SCALES 
WHEN YOU MEASURE THE WEIGHT 
OF THE GREAT BIG BLUE WHALE 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND KILOGRAMS 
BLUE WHALE 
BLUE WHALE 
MEASURING THE SIZE OF THAT GREAT BLUE WHALE
