THREE HUNDRED MILES NORTH OF JERUSALEM THE PILGRIM ROAD RUNS THROUGH MAARRAT AN NUMAN 
IN MIDWINTER OF THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND NINETY EIGHT THIS SMALL TOWN WAS INVADED BY CANNIBALS 
MEN WHO HAD MARCHED TWO THOUSAND MILES TO DO GOOD IN THE NAME OF CHRIST 
IN MAARRAT OUR TROOPS BOILED PAGAN ADULTS IN COOKING POTS 
THEY IMPALED CHILDREN ON SPITS AND DEVOURED THEM GRILLED 
THIS WAS THE FIRST CRUSADE 
WHAT MADE THE CRUSADERS INTO MONSTERS 
THE SEARCH FOR AN ANSWER BEGINS IN CONSTANTINOPLE 
TAKE ME BACK TO CONSTANTINOPLE 
NO YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO CONSTANTINOPLE 
NOW IT'S ISTANBUL NOT CONSTANTINOPLE 
WHY DID CONSTANTINOPLE GET THE WORKS 
NOBODY'S BUSINESS BUT THE TURKS' EXACTLY THE POINT 
IT MAY BE NOBODY'S BUSINESS BUT THE TURKS' NOW BUT NINE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
THIS WAS THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 
ITS LATIN NAME WAS BYZANTIUM NOT THAT THEY SPOKE LATIN HERE 
IT WAS A GREEK CITY AND THEY CALLED IT CONSTANTINOPOLIS 
NOWADAYS OF COURSE IT'S JUST CALLED BY THE GREEK WORDS IN THE CITY EIS TIN POLIN ISTANBUL 
EVERYONE THINKS IT'S TURKISH NO WONDER IT'S CALLED BYZANTIUM 
IF THE EMPEROR OF CONSTANTINOPLE OR BYZANTIUM 
OR EIS TIN POLIN OR WHATEVER WHOSE NAME WAS ALEXIUS COULD SEE THESE MINARETS HE'D TURN IN HIS GRAVE 
HE SPENT HIS WHOLE LIFE DEFENDING THIS CHRISTIAN CITY AGAINST THE MUSLIMS 
THE TURKS WERE NOMADIC WARRIORS FROM CENTRAL ASIA 
NEWLY CONVERTED TO ISLAM 
THEY INVADED THE MIDDLE EAST AND PART OF ALEXIUS'S EMPIRE 
TWENTY YEARS LATER ALEXIUS WAS READY TO KICK THEM OUT BUT HE NEEDED MORE SOLDIERS 
IT'S ONE THOUSAND NINETY FIVE THE TURKS HAVE ESTABLISHED THEIR CAPITAL ONLY ONE HUNDRED MILES FROM CONSTANTINOPLE 
ALEXIUS DECIDED HE NEEDS HELP FROM HIS BROTHER CHRISTIANS IN THE WEST 
SO HE'S SENDING A LETTER TO THE POPE ASKING FOR HELP 
IT SEEMS A REASONABLE PROPOSITION 
ACTUALLY ALEXIUS CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO IMAGINE THE EFFECT THIS LETTER WILL HAVE 
THIS LETTER BLEW THE WORLD APART 
ALEXIUS RULED THE BYZANTINE CHURCH AND HE ASSUMED THE POPE WOULD ACT LIKE A BYZANTINE OFFICIAL 
ORGANISING THE RECRUITMENT OF A FEW PAID PROFESSIONAL SOLDIERS 
THIS WAS A MISTAKE 
THERE WERE PLENTY OF PROFESSIONAL SOLDIERS IN EUROPE 
THE BARBARIANS WHO DESTROYED THE ROMAN EMPIRE HAD BUILT A SOCIETY BASED ON FIGHTING 
THEY HAD CONVERTED TO CHRISTIANITY AND THEY RECOGNISED THE AUTHORITY 
OF THE BISHOP OF ROME PAPA THE POPE 
BUT THE POPE WAS NOT A BYZANTINE OFFICIAL 
HE WAS AN AMBITIOUS POLITICIAN BUILDING A SUPERPOWER 
AT ITS CENTRE WAS THE MONASTERY OF CLUNY IN FRANCE 
THERE WERE ONCE SEPARATE CHURCHES 
EACH CONTROLLED BY THE ARMOURED THUG WHO RULED THAT PARTICULAR BIT OF GROUND BUT NO MORE 
CLUNY SPOKE OF A GREATER CHURCH THE CHURCH THAT EMBRACED CHURCHES 
AND SUPERVISED AND CONTROLLED EVERY CHURCH AND EVERY CHURCHMAN AND ALL CHRISTIAN SOULS 
TODAY THE LARGEST ENCLOSED SPACE ON EARTH IS THE PENTAGON 
IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY IT WAS CLUNY 
IN ONE THOUSAND SEVENTY THREE A CHURCHMAN INVOLVED WITH CLUNY 
HAD BECOME POPE GREGORY THE SEVENTH AND HE BEGAN DEMANDING THAT THE MEN IN ARMOUR BOW BEFORE THE POWER 
OF THE CHURCH OR RISK THE WRATH OF GOD 
NO ONE HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO STAND IN HIS WAY 
FOR THE ONLY TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE PAPACY 
A GROUP OF EXTREME RADICAL REFORMERS HAD SEIZED CONTROL OF IT 
IN A SERIES OF BREATHTAKING ACTIONS WHICH INCLUDED EXCOMMUNICATING THE PATRIARCH OF CONSTANTINOPLE 
EFFECTIVELY DISMISSING THE KING OF GERMANY AND WESTERN EMPEROR FROM HIS POST AS THEIR PROTECTOR 
SUMMONING NOBLES FROM ALL OVER EUROPE TO PROTECT THE PAPACY 
DEMANDING OF BISHOPS THAT THEY SHOULD BE FREE BUT SUBJECT TO ROME 
IN A SERIES OF THESE BREATHTAKING MOVES THESE RADICALS HAD COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED THE PAPACY 
WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE WESTERN CHURCH WAS THAT THE POPE WAS BECOMING THE HEAD OF THE STATE 
IT WAS BECOMING CHRISTENDOM UNITED UNDER THE POPE 
POPE GREGORY CREATED A MILITANT REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT 
STRUGGLING TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE WHOLE WORLD AND MAKE IT TRULY CHRISTIAN 
POPE GREGORY'S SUCCESSOR URBAN WAS CARRYING ON THE GOOD WORK 
AND THEN THE EMPEROR'S LETTER FELL AS IT WERE INTO HIS LAP 
THE POPE DECIDED TO USE ALEXIUS'S LETTER AS AN EXCUSE 
FOR CREATING HIS OWN ARMY AND CONQUERING THE EAST 
WHEN THE POPE TALKED ABOUT LIBERATING THE HOLY LAND 
WHAT HE MEANT WAS BRINGING THEM UNDER THE POWER OF THE POPE UNDER THE POWER OF THE WESTERN CHURCH 
NOW YOU CAN WELL SAY THAT THIS IS NOT A VERY RELIGIOUS EXERCISE 
JESUS TOLD HIS FOLLOWERS TO LOVE THEIR ENEMIES NOT EXTERMINATE THEM 
JESUS'S WORDS WERE A PROBLEM FOR ALL CHRISTIAN KNIGHTS IN ANY CASE 
IF A KNIGHT WAS ATTACKED HE WAS SUPPOSED TO KILL HIS ATTACKER AND ALL HIS RELATIVES 
BUT THE LORD HAD ORDERED HIS FOLLOWERS TO TURN THE OTHER CHEEK 
TAKE A RICH YOUNG WARRIOR LIKE TANCRED DE HAUTEVILLES 
EVEN ON A BAD DAY HE WOULD END UP KILLING SOMEONE 
IF YOU COULD AFFORD THE RIGHT KIT THERE WASN'T MUCH CHANCE OF BEING KILLED YOURSELF 
HE WAS TRAINED TO DESTROY THE WEAK 
BUT TANCRED'S BIOGRAPHER RECORDED THAT THIS SENSITIVE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD 
WAS VERY WORRIED THAT GOD DISAPPROVED OF KILLING PEOPLE 
THIS CONFLICT OF MORAL AUTHORITIES MADE FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL INSTABILITY 
WE CAN ALL RECOGNISE IN TANCRED A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THE DOUBLE BIND THEORY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA 
AND KNIGHTS HAD NO TEDDY BEARS NO WONDER THEY LASHED OUT IN A CRISIS 
THE POPE RETURNED TO CLUNY AND BEGAN TO ORGANISE BACKING 
FOR HIS PLAN TO CREATE A CHURCH ARMY 
THEN HE SUMMONED A LARGE CHURCH COUNCIL AT CLERMONT CATHEDRAL 
HE MADE IT KNOWN THAT HE WAS GOING TO MAKE AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT 
AT THE END OF THE MEETING THERE WAS TREMENDOUS EXCITEMENT 
NOBODY KNEW WHAT IT WOULD BE 
BUT THEY KNEW IT WOULD BE OUT OF THE ORDINARY 
AN ACCURSED RACE 
A RACE UTTERLY ALIENATED FROM GOD 
HAS INVADED THE LANDS OF THOSE CHRISTIANS 
IN THE EVENT THE CROWDS THAT TURNED UP TO HEAR HIM WERE SO VAST 
THEY HAD TO HOLD THE MEETING IN A FIELD OUTSIDE THE CATHEDRAL 
THE CHAP WHO PAINTED THIS PICTURE FOUR HUNDRED YEARS LATER DIDN'T GET IT RIGHT 
YOUR OWN BLOOD BROTHERS ARE EITHER SUBJECTED IN THEIR HOMES TO OTHER MASTERS 
OR ARE DRIVEN FROM THEM OR ARE FLOGGED 
AND EXILED AS SLAVES FOR SALE IN THEIR OWN LAND 
SLIGHTLY MISLEADING THE INVASION HAD BEEN OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO AND THEY TREATED CHRISTIANS QUITE REASONABLY 
THIS IS MEDIAEVAL TABLOID JOURNALISM 
TURKS HAD ONLY MASSACRED ARABS BUT THE POPE WAS BUILDING UP WAR FEVER 
TO DO IT HE OFFERED A SPECTACULAR SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF BEING A CHRISTIAN KNIGHT 
CHRIST HAD BEEN MISQUOTED IT WAS ONLY A SIN TO KILL CHRISTIANS 
YOU ARE ARROGANT WITH GREAT PRIDE 
YOU RAGE AGAINST YOUR BROTHERS AND CUT EACH OTHER TO PIECES 
YOU SHOULD SHUDDER BRETHREN 
YOU SHOULD SHUDDER TO RAISE AN ANGRY HAND 
AGAINST CHRISTIANS 
IT IS LESS WICKED 
TO BRANDISH YOUR SWORDS AGAINST SARACENS 
THAT IS THE ONLY WARFARE THAT IS RIGHTEOUS 
TANCRED'S DILEMMA WAS SOLVED 
IT WAS HIS CHRISTIAN DUTY TO GO OUT AND KILL FOR GOD 
HIS BIOGRAPHER WAS THRILLED 
AT LAST AS IF PREVIOUSLY ASLEEP HIS VIGOUR WAS AROUSED 
HIS POWERS GREW HIS EYES OPENED HIS COURAGE WAS BORN 
AND OF COURSE WHAT THE POPE WAS PROPOSING 
WAS WAR AS A PENANCE A PENITENTIAL WAR 
A WAR WHICH ASSISTED A MAN TOWARDS SALVATION 
WAR AS A DEVOTION 
AND IF ONE THINKS OF FASTING PENANCE PRAYER AS DEVOTIONS 
THIS IS WAR AS THE EQUIVALENT OF PRAYER 
NOW I CAN THINK OF NO PRECEDENT IN CHRISTIAN HISTORY FOR THAT 
IT WAS A WAY OF THE IMITATION OF CHRIST 
VERY PECULIAR SINCE CHRIST SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A PACIFIST 
WHO HAD MORE IN COMMON WITH GANDHI THAN THIS AGGRESSIVE CHRISTIANITY 
A PILGRIM ADVENTURE 
YOUR PRIEST SAYS GO 
YOUR BISHOP SAYS GO 
YOUR POPE SAYS GO 
TAKE THE CROSS TO JERUSALEM 
AS PILGRIMS IN ARMS 
THE POPE'S CALL NOW WENT OUT ACROSS EUROPE 
TO GET BUMS ON SADDLES THE CHURCH COULD BOAST IT HAD A CAST OF STARS 
SEE RAYMOND COUNT OF TOULOUSE 
HE HAMMERED THE MOORS IN SPAIN HE'LL SMASH THEM IN JERUSALEM 
HE TAKES HIS FAMILY HE EXPECTS TO BE IN CHARGE FOR THE WHOLE CRUSADE 
CRUSADING DUKE GODFREY OF LORRAINE 
HE'S IN A PRECARIOUS SITUATION AT HOME HE'S DESPERATE TO BE IN CHARGE 
THRILL TO HUGH OF FRANCE 
HE THINKS A LOT OF HIMSELF AS HIS BROTHER'S THE KING BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY MONEY HE'S ON THE MAKE 
JOIN THESE GREAT KNIGHTS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO SAVE THE HOLY SEPULCHRE FROM THE BLOOD CRAZED INFIDELS 
RIDE WITH THE HEROES 
GET YOUR PLACE IN HEAVEN BY SENDING INFIDELS TO HELL 
THERE WERE NO FILMS BUT THE CHURCH HAD A MEANS OF MASS COMMUNICATION 
THE CRUSADE WAS THE FIRST ON GENERAL RELEASE THE IMPACT WAS STUNNING 
THERE HAD BEEN HOLY WARS BEFORE BUT THIS WAS NEW A FIGHTING PILGRIMAGE 
EACH PILGRIM WORE A CROSS TO SHOW THEY'D TAKEN THE VOW TO REACH JERUSALEM 
THEY'D BE EXCOMMUNICATED IF THEY TURNED BACK 
IF NOT THEY'D BE FREED PENALTIES IN THIS LIFE OR THE NEXT FOR ANY SINS 
THIS IS A COMPLETELY REVOLUTIONARY AND RADICAL IDEA WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE COME FROM THE MIND OF THE POPE 
BECAUSE ONE REALLY CAN SEE NO PREHISTORY IN IT 
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE FIRST CRUSADE WAS THAT THE TRADITIONS OF HOLY WAR IN CHRISTIANITY TOOK A SHIFT 
ONTO A MUCH MORE RADICAL PLANE 
AND WHAT IS AMAZING IS THE WAY PEOPLE RESPONDED TO IT 
THE INFIDEL BARBARIANS IN THEIR FRENZY HAVE INVADED AND RAVISHED THE CHURCHES OF GOD 
IN THE CITY OF CHRIST DEPOPULATED THEM BY THE SWORD PILLAGE AND FIRE 
THEY CIRCUMCISE THE CHRISTIANS AND THEY SPREAD THE BLOOD ON THE ALTARS 
LISTEN GOOD PEOPLE NOTHING LIKE IT HAD EVER HAPPENED BEFORE 
BUT IT WASN'T MEANT TO HAPPEN THESE WEREN'T MIGRANTS OR NOMADS 
THESE WERE SETTLED COMMUNITIES WHO STOPPED WORK PACKED THEIR BAGS AND SET OFF TO PUT THE WORLD TO RIGHTS 
WHAT ON EARTH MADE THEM DO IT 
THE CHURCH HAD A POWER OVER PEOPLE THAT IT REALLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND 
IT HAD SUCCEEDED AT MAKING HEAVEN AS REAL AS ANYTHING ON EARTH 
THE CHURCH TAUGHT THAT JUDGMENT DAY WAS AT HAND AND THE FIRES OF HELL WERE VERY REAL INDEED 
ALL MEN GOING THERE WHO DIE WHETHER IT IS ON THE JOURNEY OR WHILE FIGHTING THE PAGANS 
WILL HAVE THEIR SINS REMITTED 
GOD HAS GIVEN THE POPE THE POWER TO GRANT THIS TO THOSE ABOUT TO GO 
THE ENEMIES' POSSESSIONS WILL BE YOURS 
YOU WILL SEIZE THEIR TREASURES AND RETURN HOME VICTORIOUS OR YOU WILL DIE GLORIOUSLY 
GO TO YOUR SWORDS EVERY ONE OF YOU I SAY GOD WILLS IT GOD WILLS IT 
THE POPE HAD EXPECTED TO RAISE AN ARMY 
HE GOT A MASS MIGRATION 
AND NO ONE KNOWS HOW MANY PEOPLE SET OUT 
TO DO WHAT THEY MUST THEY WERE PREPARED TO FOLLOW ANY LEADER 
INCLUDING IN ONE CASE A DIVINELY INSPIRED GOOSE 
WELL I HAD ON GOOD AUTHORITY THAT THE GOOSE ON THE RIGHT 
IS A DIRECT DESCENDENT OF THE FAMOUS CRUSADE LEADER SO I'M GOING TO HAVE A WORD 
EXCUSE ME I'D LIKE TO KNOW ER I'D LIKE TO KNOW 
UM HAVE YOU ANY FAMILY STORIES OF YOUR GREAT ANCESTOR 
DO YOU REMEMBER HIM PERSONALLY YOURSELF 
DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT THE GOOSE 
I SAID IT WAS A SILLY IDEA INTERVIEWING A GOOSE 
IT WAS NOT ONLY POULTRY THAT LED THE WAY 
AN ECCENTRIC TRAMP CALLED PETER THE HERMIT ATTRACTED A HUGE FOLLOWING 
HE INSPIRED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO SET OFF FOR JERUSALEM LEAVING EVERYONE ELSE TO CATCH UP 
HE HAD TRIED TO GO ON A PILGRIMAGE AND HAD BEEN SENT BACK 
SO HE COULD SPEAK WITH PERSONAL EXPERIENCE ABOUT IT 
IT WAS TO RENEW THE PILGRIMAGE THAT WAS THE MOTIVE THAT MADE SO MANY OF THE HUMBLER PEOPLE 
EAGER TO GO ON THE CRUSADE 
PETER CERTAINLY HAD CHARISMA 
HE RODE A DONKEY THAT HIS FOLLOWERS REVERED ALMOST AS MUCH AS PETER HIMSELF 
HIS CRITICS SAID IT LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE HIM 
PETER SOON HAD A FOLLOWING OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
BUT OTHER MORE SINISTER LEADERS EMERGED FROM THE GERMAN FORESTS 
BARBARIOUS WARLORDS WHO CLAIMED MYSTERIOUS POWERS AND SEEMED ATTRACTED BY THE SMELL OF BLOOD 
THEY WERE KEEN TO SPILL IT AND THEY SOON FOUND THEIR FIRST VICTIMS 
NOT AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT MUSLIMS BUT JEWS 
IT SEEMED NONSENSE TO MARCH THREE THOUSAND MILES TO KILL MUSLIMS IN THE HOLY LAND 
PEOPLE ABOUT WHOM THEY KNEW VIRTUALLY NOTHING 
WHEN THE PEOPLE WHO HAD OR SO THE CRUSADERS BELIEVED KILLED CHRIST WERE ALIVE ON THEIR DOORSTEPS 
THE TOMBS OF THE VICTIMS CAN STILL BE SEEN IN THE JEWISH CEMETERY 
AT WORMS IN GERMANY 
ALL OF A SUDDEN LIKE A THUNDERBOLT 
IN ONE THOUSAND NINETY SIX AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST CRUSADE A HORRIBLE POGROM 
A HORRIBLE DESTRUCTION WHICH DESTROYED THE COMMUNITY 
BANDS OF MARAUDERS ATTACKED THE JEWISH QUARTER 
SOME TRIED TO FIND REFUGE AT THE BISHOP'S PALACE HIS RESIDENCE 
THEY WERE PRIVILEGED AND THEY WERE PROTECTED BY IMPERIAL DECREE 
BUT IT DIDN'T HELP 
IT HAPPENED THROUGHOUT THE REGION 
WORMS MEINZ AND COLOGNE WERE HARDEST HIT 
CRUSADING REALLY INSTITUTIONALISED ANTI SEMITISM IN EUROPE 
AND MADE IT AN INCURABLE DISEASE 
HENCEFORTH EVERY TIME A CRUSADE TO THE HOLY LAND WAS CALLED 
THERE WERE POGROMS AGAINST JEWS BACK HOME 
TODAY WORMS HAS A SYNAGOGUE BUT NO CONGREGATION 
THE PROCESS BEGUN IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY WAS COMPLETED IN THE TWENTIETH 
THIS MASSACRE WAS JUST A BEGINNING 
THESE UNOFFICIAL CRUSADERS WITH PETER THE HERMIT HAD NO ORGANISATION OR FORMAL LEADERS 
BUT THEY KNEW WHERE THEY WERE GOING 
ALL MEDIAEVAL MAPS SHOWED JERUSALEM AS THE CENTRE OF THE WORLD 
AND THEY KNEW THEY HAD TO HEAD FOR CONSTANTINOPLE 
IT WAS A WELL TRODDEN ROUTE FOR PILGRIMS 
OF COURSE NO ONE HAD DONE ANY PLANNING OR THOUGHT TO PROVIDE FOOD OR DRINK FOR ALL THESE HORDES 
SO THERE WAS CONSTANT TROUBLE AS THEY STOLE FROM AND FOUGHT THE LOCAL PEOPLE ON THE WAY 
IN SEMLIN FOR EXAMPLE AN ARGUMENT OVER A PAIR OF SHOES TURNED INTO A RIOT THAT LEFT FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE DEAD 
WHEN IMPERIAL TROOPS TRIED TO CONTROL THEM AS THEY CROSSED THE SAVA RIVER THEY KILLED THE TROOPS 
THEN THEY ENTERED BELGRADE WHICH THEY PILLAGED AND SET ON FIRE 
PETER THE HERMIT'S ARMY FINALLY ARRIVED OUTSIDE THE FABLED WALLS OF BYZANTIUM ON FIRST AUGUST ONE THOUSAND NINETY SIX 
THEY'D BEEN WALKING FOR FOUR MONTHS COVERING AS MUCH AS TWENTY FIVE MILES IN ONE DAY 
BUT THEY WERE NOT AT ALL WHAT HAD BEEN REQUESTED 
WHAT THE EMPEROR HAD IN MIND WHEN HE APPEALED TO THE WEST WAS A FEW HUNDRED MERCENARIES OR KNIGHTS 
WHAT PETER'S TURNED UP WITH IS THIS VAST VOLATILE INCOMPREHENSIBLE RABBLE OF SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
THIS IS A HEADACHE NOT A HELP 
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THE CRUSADES WERE BASICALLY A BARBARIAN INVASION 
BUT BARBARIAN INVASIONS CAN BE INSPIRED BY A BELIEF THAT ONE'S DOING ONE'S RELIGIOUS DUTY 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEIR IDEA OF GOD'S WORK WAS RATHER DESTRUCTIVE AND NOT FRIGHTFULLY CIVILISED 
WITH THE WARRIORS CAME A HOST OF CIVILIANS OUTNUMBERING THE SANDS OF THE SEASHORE OR THE STARS OF HEAVEN 
THEY WERE CARRYING PALMS AND BEARING CROSSES ON THEIR SHOULDERS 
THERE WERE WOMEN AND CHILDREN TOO WHO HAD LEFT THEIR OWN COUNTRIES 
THOSE WERE THE WORDS OF THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER ANNA 
NEITHER SHE NOR HER FATHER REALISED THAT THESE PEOPLE HAD COME BECAUSE OF HIS OWN LETTER TO THE POPE 
THE EMPEROR WAS CURIOUS TO MEET PETER THE HERMIT 
BUT HE KEPT THE GATES OF HIS CITY FIRMLY CLOSED AGAINST PETER'S ARMY 
THEY WERE EVENTUALLY LET IN BUT ONLY IN SIGHTSEEING PARTIES OF SIX SO I DOUBT ALL SIXTY THOUSAND GOT INSIDE 
THOSE THAT DID GET IN HAD PROBABLY NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE BYZANTIUM 
BYZANTIUM CONSTANTINOPLE WAS LARGER THAN ALL THE CHRISTIAN CITIES OF THE WEST ADDED TOGETHER 
AND CONSTANTINOPLE WAS STILL FILLED WITH THE RICHES OF A ROMAN IMPERIAL CAPITAL 
THIS PLACE FOR EXAMPLE WAS BUILT BY THE EMPEROR CONSTANTINE IN THE FOURTH CENTURY 
IT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE 
IT'S EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE WHEN YOU REALISE IT WASN'T BUILT AS A PALACE 
THIS WAS JUST BUILT AS ONE OF THE CITY'S UNDERGROUND WATER SYSTEMS 
IT WASN'T EVEN THE BIGGEST ONE OF THOSE 
THE CITY WAS DOMINATED BY A HUGE NEW PALACE COMPLEX THE BLACHERNAE 
WHOSE GARDENS HOUSED A MENAGERIE OF EXOTIC BEASTS 
IT HELD THE GREATEST CHURCH THE CHURCH OF HAGHIA SOPHIA ALREADY FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
AND THE GIGANTIC RACETRACK AND SPORTS ARENA THE HIPPODROME 
THE CITY HOUSED A COLLECTION OF HOLY RELICS THAT INCLUDED THE CROWN OF THORNS 
AND A PORTRAIT OF THE VIRGIN PAINTED BY SAINT LUKE 
BUT THIS WASN'T WHAT PETER'S PEASANTS HAD COME TO SEE 
THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO JERUSALEM AND THAT LAY ACROSS THE BOSPHORUS 
ALEXIUS KNEW THAT THIS RABBLE WOULD BE BUTCHERED ONCE THEY GOT INTO TURKISH TERRITORY 
AND HE ADVISED PETER TO WAIT FOR THE POPE'S REAL ARMY TO ARRIVE 
PETER INSISTED THEY WERE GOING ON 
THE BOSPHORUS IS ONLY EIGHT HUNDRED YARDS WIDE BUT IT FEELS LIKE AN OCEAN 
YOU STILL HAVE THIS SENSE OF ADVENTURE LEAVING ONE CONTINENT AND RISKING ANOTHER 
THANK YOU THANK YOU 
FOR ANY EUROPEAN THERE'S A SENSE THAT HERE IS WHERE THE REAL JOURNEY BEGINS 
IT STILL FEELS LIKE THAT TODAY 
AT LAST THE CRUSADERS WERE IN THE LAND OF THE INFIDEL 
ASIA WAS THE CONTINENT OF BARBARIAN HORDES BUT RIGHT NOW EUROPE WAS ABOUT TO GET ITS OWN BACK 
THE BARBARIAN HORDES OF REIMS AND BRUSSELS COLOGNE AND MILAN 
LANDED ON THE UNSUSPECTING ASIAN SHORE 
THIS WAS THE PILGRIM ROAD TO JERUSALEM 
IT'S A NICE WALK BUT THE PEASANTS' CRUSADE DIDN'T GET FAR ALONG IT 
THEY MADE A BASE CAMP AT CIVETOT 
FROM THERE THEY SET ABOUT THEIR GOD GIVEN MISSION TO TORTURE AND MASSACRE THE LOCALS WITH A WILL 
THE ONLY SNAG WAS THAT MOST OF THE LOCAL INHABITANTS WERE CHRISTIANS 
I DON'T SUPPOSE THE CRUSADERS COULD BE EXPECTED TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE 
A FEW THOUSAND FRENCHMEN IN THE PARTY DECIDED TO ATTACK THE TURKISH CAPITAL NICAEA 
THEY COULDN'T GET INTO THE CITY BECAUSE IT HAD STOUT WALLS 
BUT THEY COULD LOOT THE VILLAGES AROUND IT 
THEY RAVAGED THE OUTSKIRTS OF NICAEA ACTING WITH HORRIBLE CRUELTY TO THE WHOLE POPULATION 
THEY CUT SOME OF THE BABIES TO PIECES 
THEY IMPALED OTHERS ON WOODEN SPITS AND ROASTED THEM OVER A FIRE 
OLD PEOPLE WERE SUBJECTED TO EVERY KIND OF TORTURE 
WELL THIS ACTION WAS OF LIMITED EFFECTIVENESS IN REDUCING THE WORLD POPULATION OF MUSLIMS 
BECAUSE THE CRUSADERS' VICTIMS WERE ONCE AGAIN CHRISTIANS 
NEVERTHELESS THE FRENCH RETURNED TO CIVETOT PLEASED WITH THEMSELVES AND BRAGGING ABOUT THEIR BOOTY 
THE GERMAN CONTINGENT DECIDED TO GO ONE BETTER 
THEY MARCHED BEYOND NICAEA AND TOOK A CASTLE WHICH THE TURKS SURROUNDED 
UNFORTUNATELY IN THEIR RUSH TO GET IN 
THEY FAILED TO NOTICE THAT THE CASTLE WELL WAS OUTSIDE THE WALLS 
AFTER A WEEK OF ROASTING IN THE ANATOLIAN SUN THEY WERE DESPERATE 
DRINKING THEIR HORSES' BLOOD AND EVEN THE CONTENTS OF A SEWER 
EVENTUALLY THEY SURRENDERED HOWEVER SURRENDER WASN'T THAT EASY 
THEY WERE GIVEN A CHOICE 
THEY COULD EITHER BE KILLED OR THEY COULD CONVERT TO ISLAM AND BE ENSLAVED 
NO MUSLIM IS PERMITTED IN ISLAMIC LAW TO ENSLAVE ANOTHER MUSLIM 
BUT NEITHER THE CRUSADERS NOR THE TURKS SEEM TO HAVE KNOWN THIS 
THE CONVERSION INVOLVED SAYING ALLAH IS GREAT AND MOHAMMED IS HIS PROPHET AND A LITTLE CEREMONY 
THIS IS THE END OF THE CEREMONY 
THESE YOUNG MEN ARE CELEBRATING THE FACT THAT THEY WILL NEVER HAVE TO BE CIRCUMCISED AGAIN 
FACED WITH A CHOICE OF CIRCUMCISION OR DEATH A LOT OF THE CRUSADERS SEEM TO HAVE CHOSEN THE LATTER 
THEIR LEADER RAINALD FACED UP TO HIS LIKE A MAN AND WAS LED OFF INTO CAPIVITY 
THE TURKISH SULTAN SENT TWO SPIES BACK TO THE FRENCH STILL AT CIVETOT 
TO SPREAD THE RUMOUR THAT THE GERMANS HAD CAPTURED NICAEA AND WERE GOING TO KEEP THE LOOT 
THE FRENCH GOT SO EXCITED THAT WHEN THE RUMOURS PROVED TO BE FALSE 
CRIES FOR JUSTICE BECAME CRIES FOR VENGEANCE AND THEY SET OFF ANYWAY 
THEY WALKED STRAIGHT INTO THE TRAP 
THEY WERE AMBUSHED HERE AND THE PEOPLE'S CRUSADE WAS FINALLY WIPED OUT 
SO GREAT A MULTITUDE DIED 
THAT WHEN THEY GATHERED UP THE REMAINS OF THE FALLEN 
THEY HEAPED UP NOT JUST A MIGHTY RIDGE OR HILL OR PEAK 
BUT A MOUNTAIN OF CONSIDERABLE HEIGHT AND DEPTH AND WIDTH 
SO HUGE WAS THE MASS OF BONES 
BUT THE OFFICIAL FORCES WERE MOVING 
HUGH OF FRANCE WAS THE FIRST TO CONTACT ALEXIUS 
KNOW EMPEROR THAT I AM THE KING OF KINGS 
THE GREATEST OF ALL BENEATH THE HEAVENS 
IT IS MY WILL THAT YOU SHOULD MEET ME ON MY ARRIVAL 
AND RECEIVE ME WITH THE POMP AND CEREMONY DUE TO MY NOBLE BIRTH 
UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS THEN SHIPWRECKED AND HAD TO BE RESCUED BY THE IMPERIAL COASTGUARD 
HE ARRIVED IN A SORRY STATE 
BUT IT GAVE THE EMPEROR A CHANCE TO SET A PRECEDENT 
FOR HANDLING MORE AWKWARD FORCES THAT WERE ALREADY ON THEIR WAY 
BY NOW THE WHOLE OF THE POPE'S OFFICIAL ARMY WAS ON THE ROAD 
OR RATHER A WHOLE SERIES OF ARMIES THAT WOULD MEET IN CONSTANTINOPLE 
RAYMOND COUNT OF TOULOUSE 
FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRENCHMEN FROM PROVENCE WELL ARMED AND READY FOR WAR 
DUKE GODFREY OF LORRAINE 
TWENTY THOUSAND NORTHERN FRENCH VERY CAPABLE 
AND FROM ITALY AND NORMANDY TANCRED'S FRIENDS AND RELATIONS 
THE NORMAN WAR MACHINE LED BY TANCRED'S UNCLE BOHEMOND 
THE EMPEROR'S FEAR WAS THAT IF THEY ALL JOINED TOGETHER AT CONSTANTINOPLE 
THEY MIGHT EVEN TURN ON THE CITY ITSELF 
ALEXIUS FERRIED EACH ARMY OVER THE BOSPHORUS BEFORE THE NEXT ARRIVED 
BUT HE ALSO WANTED THEM TO SWEAR THAT ANY LAND THEY CONQUERED WOULD BE HIS AND NOT THEIRS 
HUGH SUBMITTED WILLINGLY 
THE OATH MEANT NOTHING TO ALEXIUS HE WAS THE AUTOCRAT THE RULER OF ALL MEN 
BUT HE KNEW THESE THINGS HAD SOME SORT OF MEANING IN THE WEST 
SO HE WAS GOING TO EXTRACT AN OATH OF ALLEGIANCE FROM ALL THE LEADERS 
AND THEN GODFREY OF LORRAINE AND HIS BROTHER BALDWIN ARRIVED WITH TWENTY THOUSAND ARMED FOLLOWERS 
THEY'D TAKEN THREE MONTHS TO GET THROUGH GERMANY AND EASTERN EUROPE 
WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT BYZANTIUM THE EMPEROR SENT HUGH TO GREET THEM TO INVITE THE LEADERS TO HIS PALACE 
AND OF COURSE TO TRY AND PERSUADE THEM TO TAKE THE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE 
THEY WERE AT ONCE RESENTFUL 
THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING TO PAY HOMAGE TO HIM IN ANY WAY 
WHEREAS ALEXIUS WHO HAD SEEMS TO HAVE RATHER DISCOVERED THIS WESTERN IDEA ABOUT HOMAGE 
DELIGHTED TO TRY AND USE IT 
THEY WOULD NOT SWEAR HOMAGE 
SO ALEXIUS CLOSED THE GATES OF THE CITY AGAINST THEM AND REFUSED TO FEED THEM 
THESE MEN HAD MARCHED ONE THOUSAND MILES 
THEY'D MARCHED ONE THOUSAND MILES ALREADY AND IN PRETTY DANGEROUS CONDITIONS SOME OF THEM OVER WINTER 
AND THE ONE THING THAT ANY ARMY COMMANDER CARED MORE ABOUT THAN ANYTHING ELSE WAS PROVISIONS 
THEY HAD TO FEED THEIR FOLLOWERS 
THEY THOUGHT THE EMPEROR WAS GOING TO LEAD THEM IN THIS GREAT ARMY 
THEY FOUND A CHAP WHO WOULDN'T GIVE THEM ANY SUPPLIES UNLESS THEY GOT ACROSS THE BOSPHORUS 
THEY BECAME VIOLENT WHAT DO YOU EXPECT 
THERE WAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF UNFORTUNATE BEHAVIOUR FROM GODFREY AND BALDWIN 
THEY AMBUSHED SIXTY LOCAL POLICEMEN AND THEN IN THE MIDDLE OF HOLY WEEK 
TRIED TO STORM CONSTANTINOPLE THE GREATEST CHRISTIAN CITY ON EARTH 
ALEXIUS OPENED THE GATES AND SENT A WELL TRAINED MILITARY FORCE TO TEACH THESE WESTERNERS SOME MANNERS 
GODFREY AND BALDWIN TOOK THE OATH LIKE GOOD BOYS 
THE EMPEROR WOULD RULE ANY LAND CONQUERED 
AS THEY TOOK THE OATH ONE FRENCH KNIGHT SAT DOWN ON THE EMPEROR'S THRONE 
IF SAFETY PINS HAD BEEN INVENTED GODFREY'S FOLLOWERS WOULD HAVE WORN THEM IN THEIR NOSES 
THEY WERE UTTERLY BOORISH 
FACED WITH AN ANCIENT RATHER CEREMONIAL CIVILISATION 
WHICH THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND 
THEY THOUGHT THAT ALL THESE STUFFY OLD OFFICIALS HAD NO SENSE OF 
MANLINESS 
AND THEY REALLY WERE DISGRACEFUL 
GODFREY AND BALDWIN'S ARMIES WERE THEN SHIPPED ACROSS THE BOSPHORUS 
AND ANOTHER ARMY ARRIVED AND ANOTHER 
AS THE FERRYMEN KEPT SHUTTLING THEM OVER A MASSIVE WAR MACHINE 
WAS BEING ASSEMBLED ON THE ASIAN COAST 
THEIR FIRST OBJECTIVE WAS NICAEA THE TURKS' CAPITAL 
AND THE BARRIER THAT HAD SPELT DOOM TO PETER THE HERMIT'S FOLLOWERS 
SULTAN KILIJ ARSLAN HADN'T EXPECTED THIS LOT TO BE WORSE THAN THE LAST 
SO HE HAD LEFT HIS WIFE AT HOME AND HAD GONE OFF TO FIGHT A NEIGHBOUR 
WHEN HE HEARD THE CRUSADERS WERE BESIEGING NICAEA HE KNEW HE'D MADE A BIG MISTAKE 
THESE WERE NOT MAD CIVILIANS ARMED WITH LITTLE MORE THAN BAD BREATH 
KILIJ ARSLAN WAS UP AGAINST HEAVILY ARMOURED KILLERS AND PROFESSIONAL WARHORSES 
THIS IS ONE AND THIS IS MIKE LOADES 
THIS IS MAX HE'S UNIQUE PROBABLY THE ONLY LIVING REPRESENTATIVE OF A NORMAN WARHORSE 
HE'S GOT ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS WELL MUSCLED DENSELY BONED 
AND SHORT EASY TO GET ON AND OFF IN ARMOUR 
THE OTHER THING TO NOTICE ABOUT MAX IS THAT HE'S A STALLION EUROPEAN KNIGHTS ALWAYS RODE STALLIONS 
STALLIONS ARE PROUD NOBLE AND BRAVE CAPABLE OF GOING RIGHT INTO THE THICK OF BATTLE 
KILIJ ARSLAN FOUND HIMSELF FACING THE LARGEST GROUP OF ARMOURED KNIGHTS EVER ASSEMBLED ON EARTH 
THEY COULDN'T WAIT TO ATTACK HIM 
THE TURKS FOUGHT IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY 
THEY DIDN'T USE THEIR LANCES UNTIL THE ENEMY WERE CONFUSED AND DAMAGED 
THEY USED HORSE ARCHERS HUNDREDS OF THEM 
SWOOPING IN CIRCLING ROUND THE ENEMY AND PICKING THEM OFF 
UNLIKE THE EUROPEAN KNIGHTS THEY RODE MARES SINCE MARES ARE FASTER AND MORE BIDDABLE 
HOWEVER A FAIR PROPORTION OF THESE MARES MUST HAVE BEEN ON HEAT 
WHICH MAKES THE AFFAIR INTERESTING FROM A STALLION'S POINT OF VIEW 
IMAGINE BEING ASKED TO CHARGE A THOUSAND ORIENTAL MARES 
NO DOCUMENT RECORDS WHAT HAPPENED 
ALL THAT WE KNOW IS THAT THE TURKS FLED FROM THE BATTLEFIELD 
AND KILIJ ARSLAN FELT HUMILIATED 
THE KNIGHTS RETURNED TIRED BUT HAPPY 
WE'RE NOT SURE HOW THEIR STALLIONS FELT 
KILIJ ARSLAN WITHDREW INTO THE HILLS 
NICAEA LAY UNDEFENDED 
THE CRUSADERS HAD TO FIND A WAY OF GETTING THROUGH OR OVER ITS WALLS 
SOONER OR LATER THEY WOULD CAPTURE THEIR FIRST MUSLIM CITY 
ALEXIUS SUSPECTED THAT ONCE THE CRUSADERS DID THEY MIGHT NEVER GIVE IT BACK TO HIM 
NOW IT SO HAPPENS THAT NICAEA FACES ONTO A LAKE 
ONE NIGHT ALEXIUS'S MEN CROSSED THE WATER AND MADE THE INHABITANTS AN OFFER THEY COULD HARDLY REFUSE 
SURRENDER TO US OR WE LEAVE YOU TO BE SLAUGHTERED BY THE MEN IN ARMOUR 
AS DAWN BROKE THE CRUSADERS WERE ABOUT TO LAUNCH THEIR GREAT ASSAULT 
BUT THEY FOUND THE CITY HAD ALREADY SURRENDERED TO ALEXIUS 
THEY FELT BETRAYED BY THE EMPEROR THEY HAD COME TO HELP 
THEY WERE SHOCKED WHEN THE EMPEROR DIDN'T TORTURE HIS TURKISH CAPTIVES 
OR MASSACRE THE CIVILIANS GREEK CHRISTIANS OR PILLAGE THEIR HOMES 
HOW COULD GOD FEARING SOLDIERS OF CHRIST EVER TRUST A MAN LIKE THAT 
NOW THEY WERE ON THEIR OWN WHICH IS EXACTLY HOW THEY LIKED IT TO BE 
NOW THEY COULD GET ON WITH WALKING A THOUSAND MILES THROUGH HOSTILE TERRRITORY 
AND RESCUE JERUSALEM WITH NO HELP FROM ANYBODY 
WHAT WAS IT LIKE WALKING ACROSS ANATOLIA IN THE BLAZING SUMMER IN FULL ARMOUR 
AND THIS IS THE MAIL 
GONNA PUT THAT ON AM I THIS MAIL HAS ABOUT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND RINGS 
HOW MUCH DOES IT WEIGH A COUPLE OF STONE OH GOOD 
DAVID LAZENBY A MEDIAEVAL WARFARE EXPERT CAME TO MAKE SURE I WAS PROPERLY DRESSED FOR THE WALK 
NOW WHAT ELSE DO I NEED I NEED A SWORD DON'T I THAT'S RIGHT 
YOU WANT A SWORD YEAH IT'S GOOD FOR THE FIGURE ISN'T IT 
WHERE'S THE 
THEN I NEED THE HELMET 
THE IRON HELMET OF SPANGANHELM CONSTRUCTION MADE IN SEGMENTS 
RIGHT A SHIELD AND THE KITE SHIELD 
YEAH THIS LOOKS LIKE A BAYEUX TAPESTRY TYPE 
EXACTLY IT'S A NORMAN STYLE SHIELD 
AND A SPIKE A SPEAR RIGHT 
I SUPPOSE WE'D BETTER GO FOR IT STILL A THOUSAND MILES TO GO AND WE'D BETTER GO 
WHEN THE CRUSADERS SET OFF DOWN THIS ROAD 
THEY COULD HAVE HAD LITTLE IDEA WHAT LAY IN STORE FOR THEM 
ONE CRUSADER WROTE HOME THAT THEY WOULD BE IN JERUSALEM IN FIVE WEEKS 
BUT THIS ROAD LED TO TWO YEARS OF HELL
