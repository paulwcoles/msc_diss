THERE ARE JUST TWO LEGS TO GO 
ON OUR EPIC CIRCUMNAVIGATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM 
BEHIND ME IS THE NORTH SEA OVER THERE THE NORTH YORKSHIRE MOORS 
BETWEEN THE TWO THE STARTING POINT FOR THE NEXT LEG OF OUR JOURNEY 
FROM HERE WE'LL BE TRAVELLING SOUTH FROM THE CRAGGY GRANDEUR OF THE YORKSHIRE COAST 
ACROSS THE RIVER HUMBER ALONG THE LINCOLNSHIRE SEASIDE 
AND ON DOWN TO THE MARSHY FENLANDS BY THE WASH 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CHARACTERISES THIS STRETCH OF COAST 
IS A TASTE FOR INNOVATION 
WE'LL TELL STORIES OF PIONEERS VISIONARIES AND THOSE WITH A TALENT FOR TURNING A FAST BUCK 
I'LL BE ACCOMPANIED ON MY JOURNEY BY OUR USUAL BAND OF SPECIALISTS 
NEIL OLIVER LOOKS AT WHAT MADE US WANT TO BE BESIDE THE SEASIDE 
I HAVE TO SAY VICTOR IT'S NOT SAYING LUXURY HOLIDAY 
ALICE ROBERTS CONDUCTS A SEVENTEENTH CENTURY CHEMISTRY EXPERIMENT WITH STALE URINE 
YUCK 
WHILE MIRANDA KRESTOVNIKOFF GOES BIRD TAGGING IN THE WASH 
MARK HORTON SAILS DOWN THE RIVER HUMBER IN A FOUR THOUSAND YEAR OLD BOAT 
AND ME I GET TO INVESTIGATE FISH FINGERSIN GRIMSBY 
TOGETHER WE'LL TAKE YOU FOR A BRACING TRIP ALONG THIS WINDSWEPT EASTERN SEABOARD 
THIS IS THE STORY OF COAST 
OUR JOURNEY TAKES US TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILES 
FROM ROBIN HOOD'S BAY DOWN TO KING'S LYNN 
OUR STARTING POINT IS A TIGHT KNIT COMMUNITY ON THE YORKSHIRE COAST 
WHOSE RELATIVE ISOLATION MADE IT A BIT DIFFERENT FROM YOUR USUAL FISHING VILLAGE 
THIS IS ROBIN HOOD'S BAY A CASCADE OF COTTAGES AND NARROW LANES 
CARVED INTO A CLIFF 
IT'S THE PRETTIEST KIND OF PLACE TO VISIT 
BUT DON'T LET ITS INNOCENT FACADE FOOL YOU 
FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS SMUGGLING WAS THE UNOFFICIAL TOWN TRADE 
FROM THE EARLY SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS CONTRABAND REGULARLY ARRIVED HERE FROM ALL OVER EUROPE 
BECAUSE OF ITS LOCATION ROBIN HOOD'S BAY COULD HAVE BEEN CUSTOM DESIGNED FOR ILLEGAL IMPORTS 
IT WAS ONE OF THE FEW SAFE HAVENS ON THE EAST COAST 
A BROAD BAY PROTECTED BY MASSIVE HEADLANDS AND BACKED BY INACCESSIBLE MOORLAND 
AND THE CLIFFS MADE PERFECT LOOKOUTS FOR THE SMUGGLERS 
FROM HERE THEY COULD SIGNAL TO THEIR ACCOMPLICES OUT AT SEA 
AND AT THE SAME TIME WATCH OUT FOR THE REVENUE MEN 
SMUGGLING WAS AT ITS PEAK IN THE SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS 
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SLAPPED HEFTY IMPORT DUTIES ON LUXURY GOODS LIKE SILK TOBACCO AND TEA 
TO PAY FOR ITS ALMOST CONSTANT WARS WITH FRANCE 
LOCAL KNOWLEDGE GAVE THE SMUGGLERS ACCESS TO A LABYRINTH OF SECRET ROUTES 
UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS THEY COULD CREEP UP THE BEACH WITH THEIR BOOTY 
AND DISAPPEAR INTO THIS TUNNEL 
THEY VENTURED INTO DRAINAGE TUNNELS LIKE THESE AT ENORMOUS RISK 
SMUGGLING CARRIED THE DEATH SENTENCE 
BUT THE REWARDS WERE WORTH THE RISKS 
BRINGING IN JUST A POUND OF TEA 
WOULD HAVE NETTED THE SMUGGLER THE EQUIVALENT OF A WEEK'S WAGES 
AT ONE POINT EIGHTY PER CENT OF ALL THE TEA DRUNK IN BRITAIN 
WAS IMPORTED ILLEGALLY 
THE SMUGGLERS TURNED THIS TUNNEL TO THEIR ADVANTAGE 
I'M LOOKING FOR HOLES IN THE CEILING ABOVE MY HEAD LIKE THIS 
THEY COULD CREEP UP HERE AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THEM STUFFING RUM AND TOBACCO 
UP THROUGH HERE INTO THE HOUSE ABOVE 
IT'S VERY INGENIOUS 
IT WASN'T JUST THE MEN WHO STRUGGLED THROUGH TUNNELS LIKE THIS 
THAT MADE MONEY OUT OF SMUGGLING 
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY IN THE VILLAGE HAD THEIR HANDS DIRTY 
THE BOATMEN THE STORER EVEN THE LOCAL SQUIRE 
WHO LIVED HERE AT THORPE HALL 
HE FINANCED THE SMUGGLING AND WOULD HAVE EXPECTED A GOOD RETURN ON HIS INVESTMENT 
HERE IN THE GROUNDS OF THE SQUIRE'S HOUSE IS AN UNDERGROUND CHAMBER 
WHERE HE STASHED HIS SHARE OF THE BOOTY LOOK 
IT'S CAREFULLY LINED IN STONE YOU CAN IMAGINE IT PACKED WITH GIN TOBACCO BRANDY AND SILK 
BY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTEEN AT THE END OF THE NAPOLEONIC WARS 
SOLDIERS WERE REDEPLOYED AS EXCISE MEN 
PUTTING A STOP TO LARGE SCALE SMUGGLING 
BUT NOT ENTIRELY 
TODAY CUSTOMS AND EXCISE RECKON NEARLY FOUR BILLION WORTH 
OF REVENUE IS LOST EVERY YEAR TO ILLEGAL IMPORTS OF TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL 
BUT THERE'S NEVER BEEN A SHORTAGE OF LEGAL WAYS TO MAKE A LIVING ALONG THIS COAST 
IF YOU'VE GOT THE INGENUITY 
WHILE THE VILLAGERS OF ROBIN HOOD'S BAY WERE LINING THEIR POCKETS BY SMUGGLING 
THE PEOPLE HERE AT RAVENSCAR JUST THREE MILES DOWN THE COAST 
MADE THEMSELVES RICH WITH A STARTLING SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY 
THESE ARE THE REMAINS OF ONE OF THE U. K.'S VERY FIRST CHEMICAL FACTORIES 
ANTHROPOLOGIST ALICE ROBERTS HAS COME TO SEE WHAT'S LEFT 
FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE CLOTH AND WOOL TRADE 
FORMED THE BACKBONE OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY 
NONE OF IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT AN INDUSTRY THAT GREW UP HERE 
I'M MEETING ARCHAEOLOGIST JOHN BUGLASS 
WHO KNOWS THE EXTRAORDINARY ROLE RAVENSCAR PLAYED 
IN SAVING BRITAIN'S CLOTH INDUSTRY 
I HAVE TO SAY JOHN THIS LOOKS RATHER DISTURBINGLY LIKE A QUARRY 
I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW ROCK CAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH CLOTH 
IT IS A QUARRY IT'S AN ALUM QUARRY 
THE TYPE OF ROCK THAT'S HERE IS ACTUALLY SHALE 
SHALE IS A SEDIMENTARY ROCK WHICH IS LAID DOWN ON THE SEABED YEAH 
HIDDEN INSIDE THE SHALE ARE CRYSTALS OR SALTS OF ALUMINIUM 
RIGHT THE ALUMINIUM SALTS CAN BE USED AS A MORDANT IN THE DYEING INDUSTRY 
WHAT'S A MORDANT BASICALLY IT'S A GLUE 
IT ACTS TO STICK THE DYE MOLECULES IN THE CLOTH 
IT STOPS THE COLOURS FADING AND IT MAINTAINS THE BRIGHTNESS 
SO WHAT IS THE ACTUAL SUBSTANCE THAT THEY'RE AFTER 
WHAT THEY'RE AFTER IS THIS MATERIAL IT'S CALLED ALUM RIGHT 
THAT'S A CRYSTAL OF PURE NATURALLY OCCURRING ALUM 
WHY DON'T THEY USE NATURAL ALUM THEN 
NATURAL ALUM DOESN'T OCCUR IN THIS COUNTRY YEAH 
THEY'RE HAVING TO BRING IT IN FROM OTHER PLACES SO THEY'D TRY TO SEEK AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE 
IN ORDER TO BREAK THE MONOPOLY 
FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO SITES LIKE THIS ONE AT RAVENSCAR 
WERE LARGE INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITIES 
EMPLOYING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN THE PRODUCTION OF THIS PRECIOUS SUBSTANCE 
YOU'D HAVE GANGS OF MEN WORKING UP AGAINST THE QUARRY FACE 
PICKAXES AND SHOVELS DIGGING IT OUT SHOVELLING IT INTO BARROWS 
THEN THEY'D BURN IT FOR THREE MONTHS WHY ARE THEY BURNING IT 
THAT CHANGES THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION SLIGHTLY 
THEY CAN THEN EXTRACT THE SALTS IT'S VERY ACIDIC SO THEY HAVE TO BURN ALKALI IN THERE 
THEY HAD A SPECIAL INGREDIENT THEY USED FOR THAT REALLY 
THAT SPECIAL INGREDIENT COMES COURTESY OF THE PRODUCTION TEAM 
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE ALUM ON THIS SITE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS 
WE'LL TRY TO RECREATE THE PROCESS 
AND HOPEFULLY DISCOVER WHY THEY NEEDED TO USE STALE HUMAN URINE 
I'VE TEAMED UP WITH OPEN UNIVERSITY CHEMIST JAMES BRUCE 
RIGHT JAMES THIS IS A NATURAL ALUM CRYSTAL 
YOUR CHALLENGE IS TO MAKE US ONE OF THOSE 
THIS IS A SOLUTION OF ALUMINIUM SULPHATE ISN'T IT YES 
EQUIVALENT TO THE LIQUOR THEY GOT FROM THE SHALE YES 
WE HAVE TO ADD THE MAGIC INGREDIENT 
YES COME ROUND THIS SIDE 
TO YOU FALLS THE HONOUR OF TAKING THE PISS THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
RIGHT 
HOW DID THEY KNOW URINE WOULD WORK 
BECAUSE URINE WAS USED FOR OTHER PROCESSES 
IT WASN'T THAT UNUSUAL TO BE USING URINE IN THESE SORTS OF PROCESSES 
IT WAS A BOTTLE ON THE SHELF THEY WOULD HAVE SAID LET'S TRY THIS 
YUCK YOU CHEMISTS ARE A WEIRD LOT 
WE SIMMERED THE DISGUSTING SOLUTION FOR HALF AN HOUR 
UNTIL SOMETHING INTERESTING HAPPENED IT'S WORKING 
THAT IS THE ALUM COMING OUT NOW THAT CLOUDY STUFF THAT WHITE STUFF IS THE ALUM 
BOIL OFF THE REMAINING LIQUID AND WHAT REMAINS IS ALUM 
THESE ARE SOME OF THE CRYSTALS WE'RE LEFT WITH LIKE SNOW YES 
THEY'RE NOT AS BIG AS THE ONE YOU SHOWED ME BEFORE 
BUT SIZE DOESN'T MATTER THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GROWN OVER A LONG PERIOD 
BEFORE WE DYE THESE PIECES OF CLOTH ONE'S TREATED WITH OUR ALUM SOLUTION 
SO HOPEFULLY IT WILL HOLD THE DYE BETTER THE OTHER IS UNTREATED 
IT LOOKS ABOUT DONE LET'S SEE WHAT THE RESULT IS 
THIS ONE IS MUCH BRIGHTER 
THERE'S MUCH MORE DYE IN THIS CLOTH 
THAN IN THIS CLOTH 
IT BECOMES OBVIOUS WHY ALUM WAS SO IMPORTANT TO THE CLOTH INDUSTRY 
BRIGHT FAST COLOURS SOLD FOR MUCH HIGHER PRICES' 
WE'VE MADE ALUM ON A TINY SCALE 
BUT THE ORIGINAL ALUM WORKS WAS MASSIVE PRODUCING SIX HUNDRED TONNES OF THE STUFF EVERY YEAR 
IN THIS CLIFF TOP CHEMICAL FACTORY 
HOWEVER IT WAS RAVENSCAR'S PROXIMITY TO THE COAST THAT WAS CRUCIAL TO ITS SUCCESS 
TO MAKE THE ALUM TONNES OF COAL FROM NEWCASTLE AND GALLONS OF URINE FROM THE SLUMS OF HULL AND LONDON 
ARRIVED BY SEA 
CLUES ON THE BEACH SHOW US HOW THIS HAPPENED 
WHAT THEY HAVE OFF TO THE SIDE ARE THESE RUT WAYS USED TO BRING THE CARTS IN 
WITH THE MATERIAL IN BARRELS 
READY TO BE LOADED STRAIGHT INTO THE BOATS 
YEAH 
YOU CAN SEE QUITE A NICE CHANNEL 
YEAH SO THESE ARE TO STOP THE CARTS SLIPPING ON THE ROCKS 
PARTLY 
IT'S BAD ENOUGH KEEPING YOUR FOOTING WITHOUT A CART FULL OF PRODUCT YOU NEED TO SELL 
THE OTHER ONE'S OVER HERE YES THEY RUN OFF DOWN THE BEACH 
THE RUTS ARE GOING TO GUIDE THE WHEELS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
LIKE A TRAIN TRACK VERY MUCH 
THIS IS THE DOCK ITSELF 
THESE ROCKS WOULD BE CLEARED OUT SO THE BOATS DIDN'T DAMAGE THEMSELVES 
IT'S BADLY ERODED NOW BUT IT'S ALL BEEN CUT AWAY BY HAND 
THE BOAT WOULD SIT TO ONE SIDE SO IT COULD BE LOADED LARGE BOATS 
YES THERE'D BE ROOM FOR TWO EVEN THREE 
HOW DID THEY GET THE ALUM DOWN FROM THE CLIFF TOP THAT COMES DOWN THERE 
THERE'S A DIAGONAL LINE THAT RUNS ALL THE WAY DOWN THE CLIFF YES 
THEY'D COME DOWN THERE ONTO THE BEACH THEN UP TO THE HARBOUR 
IF YOU HADN'T HAVE POINTED THAT OUT I WOULDN'T HAVE NOTICED THAT 
THAT'S THE EDGE OF A ROAD YOU CAN SEE COBBLES STICKING OUT 
YOU CAN SEE THE LINE OF THE ROADWAY 
THE BOATS WOULD BE IN THE DOCK 
THEY'D LOAD THE STUFF UP THE TIDE COMES IN THEY'D WALK THE BOAT BACK 
TURN THEM ROUND AND OFF TO SEA TO SHIP THE ALUM WHEREVER REQUIRED 
POSSIBLY WORLDWIDE CERTAINLY ACROSS BRITAIN AND NORTHERN EUROPE A VERY VALUABLE COMMODITY 
BUT THE INVENTION OF SYNTHETIC DYES RANG THE DEATH KNELL FOR ALUM FACTORIES 
AFTER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS 
THIS INGENIOUS INDUSTRY CREATED BY PEOPLE MAKING THE MOST OF SCANT RESOURCES AROUND THEM ENDED 
RAVENSCAR FINALLY CLOSED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY TWO 
ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT THIS JOURNEY FOR ME 
IS THE CHANCE TO SEE SOME OF THE LESS WELL KNOWN COAST PATHS 
THIS IS CLEVELAND WAY A WONDERFUL HIKE WHICH TEETERS BETWEEN THE MOORS AND THE SEA 
A FEW MILES SOUTH WE TEMPORARILY LEAVE BEHIND 
THE WILD YORKSHIRE HILLS AND THE SHORELINE CHANGES COMPLETELY 
WELCOME TO BRITAIN'S FIRST SEASIDE RESORT IT SAYS ON THE SIGN AS YOU DRIVE INTO SCARBOROUGH 
THIS IS WHERE THE SEASIDE HOLIDAY WAS INVENTED WAY BACK IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN 
HISTORIAN NEIL OLIVER HAS BEEN MAKING THE ACQUAINTANCE OF WHAT THE GUIDEBOOKS CALL 
THE QUEEN OF THE YORKSHIRE COAST 
I REMEMBER COMING ON HOLIDAY TO SCARBOROUGH WITH MY MUM AND DAD 
INNOVATIONS IN HOLIDAY MAKING YOU'RE AFTER THIS IS THE PLACE 
VICTORIAN ENGINEERS TRANSFORMED A REMOTE FISHING PORT 
INTO ONE OF EUROPE'S PREMIER RESORTS 
SCARBOROUGH HAS ALWAYS PRIDED ITSELF ON BEING ABLE TO STAY ON TOP OF THE TOURISM GAME 
IT HAD THIS THE WORLD'S FIRST CLIFF TRAMWAY OPENED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR EUROPE'S BIGGEST HOTEL THE GRAND 
AND IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE LARGEST AQUARIUM IN THE WORLD 
AND IT HAD THIS THE FOCAL POINT OF EVERY VISIT TO SCARBOROUGH 
THE SPA OPENED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT AND ITS ELEGANT SUN COURT 
THOUGH THAT'S NOT TO SAY THE SUN ALWAYS SHINES 
DURING ITS VICTORIAN HEYDAY THE SPA'S REPUTATION GREW AS A PLACE OF ENTERTAINMENT AND RELAXATION 
AND WAS THE MOST POPULAR MUSIC VENUE OUTSIDE OF LONDON 
SIMON KENWORTHY IS THE LEADER OF THE SPA ORCHESTRA AND SOMETHING OF AN EXPERT ON THE TOWN'S HISTORY 
WHEN WAS SCARBOROUGH'S HEYDAY 
WELL THE TRAINS ARRIVED IN SCARBOROUGH IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
FROM THEN ON PEOPLE STARTED TO COME TO SCARBOROUGH IN THEIR MASSES 
BY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY WHEN THIS WONDERFUL BUILDING WAS BUILT THE PLACE WOULD HAVE BEEN HEAVING WITH PEOPLE 
PEOPLE OF A CERTAIN QUALITY AS WELL BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO COME IN 
YOU'D HAVE THE ARISTOCRACY PROMENADING ABOUT IN FRONT OF THE SPA LISTENING TO THE MUSIC 
SCARBOROUGH WAS ALIVE WITH PEOPLE IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE TOURIST RESORT 
PEOPLE SAY THAT THE BAY HERE LOOKS LIKE THE BAY OF NAPLES 
A LOT OF THE ARCHITECTURE IS TO DO WITH THE LIE OF THE LAND IN SCARBOROUGH 
IT'S QUITE HILLY 
SO WE'VE GOT THESE WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITIES FOR TERRACES BRIDGES WE'VE GOT THE CASTLE ON THE HILL 
WAS THERE A LOT OF SNOBBERY DURING THE HEYDAY WE ARE THE BEST 
THERE IS NOW IT CARRIES ON THIS SNOBBERY 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO COME TO US COME SPECIFICALLY TO SCARBOROUGH 
BECAUSE IT HAS THIS AIR OF QUIET GENTILITY ABOUT IT 
IT DOES MAKE THEM FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THIS FANTASTIC ATMOSPHERE 
I'M SOLD GREAT I'M GOING TO SEE OUT MY TWILIGHT YEARS HERE AS WELL 
DESPITE ITS SNOBBERY SCARBOROUGH'S SUCCESS AS A SEASIDE RESORT 
WAS ACTUALLY BASED ON AN ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERY 
THE WHOLE FORTUNE OF THIS TOWN IS BASED ON THIS LITTLE BIT OF WATER COMING OUT HERE 
PEOPLE CAME TO SCARBOROUGH AFTER THE WATER WAS DISCOVERED IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY 
BY A LOCAL LADY 
SHE DISCOVERED IT HAD MIRACULOUS PROPERTIES THIS IS WHAT'S LEFT THAT'S IT THAT'S IT 
WHAT'S THAT 
IT'S JUST A LITTLE BROWN SMEARY MESS IT'S THE MAGIC WATER OF SCARBOROUGH 
IT'S NOT REALLY SAFE TO DRINK THESE DAYS BUT YOU CAN HAVE A GO 
DO YOU THINK NOT 
PEOPLE WERE TAKING THE WATERS INTO THE NINETEEN FIFTIES FOR ITS MEDICINAL PROPERTIES 
INSTANT DYSENTERY I'D HAVE THOUGHT 
I WOULDN'T FANCY IT MYSELF IT LOOKS FAIRLY HORRIBLE 
WHERE THERE'S MUCK THERE'S BRASS 
THE WATER SIMPLY CONTAINED MAGNESIUM SULPHATE AS EFFECTIVE AS ALKA SELTZER IS TODAY 
DID THEY MAKE MUCH USE OF THE BEACH ITSELF INITIALLY NO 
PEOPLE JUST CAME FOR THE WATERS 
BUT DOCTOR WITTIE IN ABOUT ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY WROTE A TREATISE WHICH WENT AROUND THE WHOLE OF THE COUNTRY 
IN THIS TREATISE HE EXTOLLED THE VIRTUES OF SEA BATHING 
HE SAID THAT A NAKED PLUNGE INTO THE SALTY WATERS FOLLOWED BY A SWEAT IN A WARM BED 
WAS A GOOD CURE FOR GOUT 
PEOPLE THOUGHT WE CAN TAKE THE WATERS AND ALSO PLUNGE INTO THE SEA AND WE'LL BE CURED 
WITH A FEW ACHES AND PAINS MYSELF I THINK I'LL GO FOR A PADDLE 
OH 
OH 
IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE THE BAY OF NAPLES BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT 
OH 
IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY 
SCARBOROUGH WAS STILL ANXIOUS TO BRING IN THE HIGH SPENDING UPPER CLASSES 
BUT WITH COMPETITION FROM NEWER BRASHER RESORTS IT WAS TIME TO RETHINK ITS IMAGE 
IT HAD TO THINK BIG 
SCARBOROUGH TURNED TO BIG GAME HUNTING FOR ITS NEXT ATTRACTION 
AFRICA HAD LIONS INDIA HAD TIGERS 
SCARBOROUGH HAD THE TUNNY TO YOU AND ME THE TUNA FISH 
TUNNY FISHING BROUGHT THE GENTRY AND THE WEALTHY BACK TO SCARBOROUGH 
FISHERMAN FRED NORMANDALE WAS JUST A SMALL BOY WHEN THEIR YACHTS AND ROLLS ROYCES PULLED INTO TOWN 
LOVELY 
I HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE TUNA HERE I THOUGHT IT WAS A TROPICAL FISH 
THE BLUE FIN TUNA LIVES IN THE ATLANTIC AS MUCH AS ANYWHERE 
IT GOES ALL OVER EUROPE 
YES 
IT WAS QUITE AN AMAZING WAY OF LIFE 
LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT 
THAT LINE UP THERE 
THE BIGGEST ONE CAUGHT ROUND HERE WAS NINE OH NINE L. B. 
THEY HAD TO BE CAUGHT FROM AN OPEN BOAT A ROWING BOAT 
THEY COULD BE ATTACHED TO THE ROD AND LINE BUT NOT THE BOAT 
IMAGINE HAVING A NINE HUNDRED L. B. FISH ON YOUR ROD IT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE A NANTUCKET SLEIGH RIDE 
A REAL DANGER OF GETTING PULLED OUT I'D SAY THAT AND THEY WEREN'T CATCHING THEM TO EAT 
IT WAS BIG GAME FISHING JUST AS YOU'D HUNT MARLIN OR SWORDFISH 
IT DIDN'T LAST LONG THE FIRST WERE CAUGHT IN THE EARLY THIRTIES AND THE LAST WAS CAUGHT IN FIFTY FOUR 
THEY STARTED TO DECLINE WITH THE DECLINE OF HERRING A SPECIAL FEW YEARS IT WAS EXCLUSIVE 
PEOPLE CAME FROM ALL OVER EUROPE THEY CAME IN THEIR YACHTS 
THEY CAME IN THEIR PRIVATE SHIPS TO GO TUNNY FISHING AT SCARBOROUGH 
TODAY BLUE FIN TUNA ARE CLOSE TO EXTINCTION WORLDWIDE 
IT'S UNLIKELY THERE'LL BE TUNNY FISHING HERE AGAIN 
IT MAY BE A BIT OLD FASHIONED AND TRYING A LITTLE TOO HARD TO IMPRESS 
BUT I LIKE SCARBOROUGH 
WHAT REALLY COMES ACROSS IS THE PRIDE PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR TOWN 
AND THAT'S GOT TO BE A GOOD THING 
FROM SCARBOROUGH OUR JOURNEY TAKES US PAST A SHELTERED BAY WHICH EMBRACES THE RESORT OF FILEY 
AND ONTO THE MOST NOTORIOUS HEADLAND ON THE YORKSHIRE COAST 
THIS IS FLAMBOROUGH HEAD 
A LETHAL SPIKE OF LAND JUTTING SIX MILES OUT INTO THE NORTH SEA 
IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR SHIPS WERE WRECKED HERE IN JUST THIRTY SIX YEARS 
THIS PART OF THE COAST STILL SEES PLENTY OF SHIPPING ACTION 
FIFTY THREE MILES FURTHER SOUTH WE COME TO SPURN HEAD 
ANOTHER REMOTE SPIT OF LAND 
LOCATED AT THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER HUMBER'S BUSY SHIPPING LANE 
IT'S HOME TO THE COUNTRY'S ONLY FULL TIME RESIDENTIAL LIFEBOAT STATION 
DURING BIG STORMS THE ROAD FLOODS 
CUTTING OFF FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD THE SEVEN FAMILIES WHO LIVE HERE 
FOR THEM ISOLATION'S A WAY OF LIFE 
LAST WINTER WE WAS CUT OFF FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS 
UM 
UNTIL THE SEA DECIDED TO BEHAVE ITSELF AND WENT BACK TO NORMAL 
WHEN WE KNOW IT'S COMING UP TO WINTER AND THE HIGH TIDES WE TEND TO DO A REALLY BIG SHOP 
I'VE GOT THREE FREEZERS ON THE GO 
AND THEY'RE ALWAYS FULL 
US WIVES ON THE STATION DO EVERYTHING BECAUSE THE MEN CAN'T GET OFF IT NO MATTER WHAT 
TO GO OUT THERE IN ROUGH WEATHER 
YOU HAVE TO BE PROUD OF HIM OF ALL OF THEM 
I WOULDN'T BE NORMAL IF I DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT HIM 
WITH THE BEACH ON THEIR DOORSTEP IT MAY LOOK IDYLLIC 
BUT THIS IS PART OF THE FASTEST ERODING SHORELINE IN EUROPE 
IN SOME PLACES LOSING UP TO TWO METRES EVERY YEAR 
BEFORE LONG THE MAP OF SPURN HEAD MAY HAVE TO BE REDRAWN 
FROM HERE WE FOLLOW THE COAST INLAND 
WHERE MARK HORTON IS INVESTIGATING OUR EARLIEST SEAGOING TRADITIONS 
THIS IS THE ENORMOUS HULL DOCKS 
FROM HERE SHIPS BRING THEIR CARGOES FROM ALL ROUND THE WORLD 
THIS IS WHERE THE FERRIES LEAVE FOR CONTINENTAL EUROPE THE TIMBER COMES IN FROM SCANDINAVIA 
THE IRON AND STEEL FROM ITALY 
THIS IS THE RIVER HUMBER THE GATEWAY TO BRITAIN 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST RECENTLY THAT THE HUMBER HAS BEEN SO BUSY 
PEOPLE LIVING AROUND HERE HAVE BEEN USING THIS RIVER FOR TRADE AND TRANSPORT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
I'VE COME TO MEET HULL ARCHAEOLOGIST BEN GEAREY 
TO FIND OUT WHY THE HUMBER ESTUARY WAS OUR BIRTHPLACE AS A SEAFARING NATION 
THERE ARE LOTS OF HARBOUR INSTALLATIONS ALL THE WAY ROUND 
IT'S IMPORTANT NOWADAYS WAS IT IMPORTANT IN THE PAST AS WELL 
YOU MAY NOT THINK OF HUMBER MUD 
AS BEING AN IMPORTANT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCE BUT IT IS 
THE MOST IMPORTANT FINDS OF THE LAST FIFTY YEARS HAVE COME OUT OF THE HUMBER MUD 
BOAT REMAINS DATING BACK THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS THE BRONZE AGE 
THESE REMAINS ARE WHAT WE CALL SEWN PLANK BOATS 
THEY'RE THE EARLIEST EXAMPLES OF THAT OUTSIDE EGYPT 
FIVE BRONZE AGE BOATS WERE EXPOSED 
BY THE SHIFTING MUD OF THE ESTUARY 
NEAR THE SMALL VILLAGE OF FERRIBY JUST OUTSIDE HULL 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE AMATEUR ARCHAEOLOGISTS WADED KNEE DEEP IN THE MUD 
RACING TO DIG OUT THE MOST COMPLETE FIND 
BEFORE THE INCOMING TIDE WASHED IT AWAY 
FORTY YEARS AFTER THIS BOAT WAS REMOVED 
ONLY NOW HAS THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FIND BECOME APPARENT 
NEW RADIOCARBON DATES REVEAL THE FERRIBY BOAT TO BE FOUR THOUSAND YEARS OLD 
THE OLDEST SEAGOING BOAT EVER FOUND IN EUROPE 
BEFORE THE BOAT DISINTEGRATED 
ENOUGH WAS LEARNT ABOUT ITS DESIGN FOR BOAT BUILDERS TO MAKE THIS HALF SIZE REPLICA 
WHAT DID THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS ACTUALLY DIG OUT OF THE MUD THE THREE BOTTOM PLANKS 
AND ALSO THIS PART OF THE SIDE HERE 
THIS IS KEY TO DECIPHERING THE TECHNOLOGY USED TO BUILD THE BOAT 
WE'RE SEEING A TRANSITION FROM A DUG OUT CANOE TECHNOLOGY TO THIS SEWN PLANK CONSTRUCTION 
WHERE YOU HAVE INDIVIDUAL PLANKS AND BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE IRON NAILS YOU SEW THEM TOGETHER 
EXACTLY YES 
AS WE PADDLE OUR WAY TOWARDS FERRIBY 
I WANT TO FIND OUT WHY OF ALL THE PLACES ALONG THE BANKS OF THE HUMBER 
SO MANY ANCIENT BOATS WERE FOUND HERE 
WE THINK WE HAVE A BRONZE AGE BOAT YARD 
WE HAVE EVIDENCE OF BOATS BEING DISMANTLED WORKING ON BOATS 
IT'S A BOAT YARD THEY WOULD HAVE CHOSEN THIS PARTICULAR SPOT 
WE'VE THE WHOLE ESTUARY WHY HERE 
WHAT YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE IS THE ENVIRONMENT BEING VERY DIFFERENT 
EXTENSIVE SALT MARSHES AROUND THE RIVER WET WOODLAND AT THE EDGES 
IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO FIND SOMEWHERE DRY 
THIS WAS THE ONLY DRY LAND AROUND YES 
AS YOU'RE GOING UP AND DOWN THIS ESTUARY THIS IS THE IDEAL PLACE TO BEACH YOUR BOAT TO REPAIR IT 
EXACTLY 
TWO OF BEN'S COLLEAGUES HAVE SOME OTHER FINDS FROM NEARBY 
WHICH SUGGEST THE FERRIBY BOATS WEREN'T ONLY SAILING ALONG RIVERS 
BUT ALSO CAPABLE OF CROSSING THE NORTH SEA 
WHAT'S THIS ONE THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING EXAMPLE 
THIS IS A FRENCH AXE THIS IS TRADE 
EXACTLY THIS HAS BEEN BROUGHT OVER FROM THE CONTINENT 
THE SORT OF AXES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TRADED IN BOATS LIKE THE FERRIBY BOAT QUITE POSSIBLY 
ISN'T IT EXTRAORDINARY 
PRESUMABLY IT'S THAT NEW MARITIME TECHNOLOGY THAT ENABLED THE BRONZE AGE TO HAPPEN 
ENABLED SOCIETIES TO HAVE METAL 
IT WAS THE BOAT EXACTLY THE BOAT IS CENTRAL TO DEVELOPMENT AT THIS TIME IN THIS AREA WE THINK 
IT SEEMS FERRIBY WAS ONCE AN INTERNATIONAL BRONZE AGE TRADING CENTRE 
THIS AREA WOULD HAVE BEEN A HIVE OF ACTIVITY YES 
COMMUNITIES CONNECTING THEMSELVES TO OTHER COMMUNITIES BY BOAT YES 
TO TRAVEL THESE LONG DISTANCES 
IT'S THOUGHT THE FERRIBY BOATS HAD SAILS 
WE'VE BUILT A REPLICA AND ACTUALLY SHOWN IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO THIS 
THAT'S THE IMPORTANT STEP FROM A FEW BITS OF WOOD IN THE MUD 
TO A FANTASTIC OBJECT LIKE THIS THAT COULD HAVE HAD AN INCREDIBLE IMPACT ON SOCIETY 
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN OVERESTIMATE THE IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE HAD 
THE FERRIBY BOATS REALLY ARE EXTRAORDINARY 
THEY WERE BEING USED AT THE SAME TIME STONEHENGE WAS BEING BUILT 
PROOF OF OUR EARLIEST ADVENTURES 
AS SEAFARERS AND TRADERS WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD 
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IN THE BRONZE AGE 
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BUILT THIS BRIDGE FOUR THOUSAND YEARS LATER 
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE MIX OF OLD AND NEW 
FERRIBY MAY HAVE BEEN THE HUB OF LIFE ON THE HUMBER FOUR THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
BUT IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES THAT ROLE BELONGED TO GRIMSBY 
THEN THE LARGEST FISHING PORT IN THE WORLD 
SAILING AS FAR AWAY AS THE ARCTIC CIRCLE AND NEWFOUNDLAND 
FISHERMEN OFTEN WORKED IN APPALLING CONDITIONS 
BUT THEY REAPED A RICH HARVEST WITH TRAWLER SKIPPERS BEING SOME OF THE BEST PAID MEN IN ENGLAND 
THESE DAYS IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT PICTURE 
SEAGULLS CALL 
OVER FISHING DEPLETED STOCKS AND NOW FISH QUOTAS 
HAVE REDUCED THAT MIGHTY FLEET TO ONLY TEN VESSELS 
BUT GRIMSBY'S STILL A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE FISH BUSINESS 
AHOY THERE MATES ANYONE PARTIAL TO A BIRDS EYE FISH FINGER 
FISH FINGERS FIRST MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE 
AND WERE CONSIDERED A LUXURY AFTER WARTIME RATIONING 
BY THE EARLY SIXTIES THEY'D FORMALLY ESTABLISHED THEIR ASSAILABLE POSITION AS A CHILD'S STAPLE DIET 
SO TAKE A TIP FROM CAPTAIN BIRDS EYE GIVE 'EM BIRDS EYE FISH FINGERS 
AND GRIMSBY IS FISH FINGER CENTRAL 
PROCESSING NEARLY A MILLION TONS OF FISH A YEAR 
ALTHOUGH SADLY NONE OF IT'S CAUGHT LOCALLY ANY MORE 
MOST OF IT ARRIVES IN FROZEN BLOCKS FROM AS FAR AWAY AS ALASKA 
HERE AT THIS PROCESSING PLANT THREE THOUSAND FISH FINGERS ROLL OFF THE CONVEYOR BELT EVERY MINUTE 
AT FULL THROTTLE GRIMSBY CAN SPLATTER BREADCRUMB AND FLASH FRY TEN MILLION FISH FINGERS WEEKLY 
THE OUTSIDE IS COOKED SO FAST 
THAT THE INSIDE REMAINS FROZEN 
FROM BLOCK TO BOX TAKES ONLY THIRTY FIVE MINUTES 
TODAY COD STOCKS ARE DIMINISHING WORLDWIDE AND SO MANUFACTURERS ARE LOOKING AT NEW IDEAS 
AND AT MORE EXOTIC FISH 
FOR ADDED CONTINENTAL PANACHE 
YOUNG'S HAVE EVEN BROUGHT IN A FRENCH CHEF SERGE NOLLENT 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE 
SO WE'VE GOT THE BARRAMUNDI WHICH COMES FROM THE INDIAN OCEAN 
THREE DAYS OLD THAT'S SHARP BE CAREFUL THIS IS VERY SHARP 
BIG UGLY MOUTH WOULDN'T WANT TO GET YOUR ARM STRUCK DOWN THERE 
AND WHAT ABOUT THIS GUY HERE O. K. 
THIS ONE IS A BARRACUDA IT'S GOT BIG TEETH HASN'T IT 
IT'S A VERY LIVELY FISH BARRACUDA AGAIN FROM THE INDIAN OCEAN 
WILL THE BRITISH REALLY WARM TO BARRACUDA AND CHIPS 
POSSIBLY 
THE CHALLENGE FOR SERGE AND HIS TEAM IS TO DEVISE A DISH THAT WILL SELL AS WELL AS THE TRUSTY FISH FINGER 
SERGE CLEARLY HAS ASPIRATIONS FOR HAUTE CUISINE 
BUT I CAN'T HELP WONDERING IF THERE'S REALLY A PLACE FOR THESE IN THE SUPERMARKET 
IS THAT FISH WRAPPED AROUND THE ASPARAGUS IT'S FILLETED SEA BASS 
SOME BRITISH ASPARAGUS AND A LITTLE BEURRE BLANC SAUCE 
WHICH IS A REDUCTION OF SHALLOTS WHITE WINE BUTTER AND CREAM 
THESE DISHES LOOK DELICIOUS 
BUT ONE USES SCALLOPS THE OTHER USES ASPARAGUS 
AND NEITHER ARE MASS PRODUCED FACTORY FODDER TO THE U. K. PUBLIC THEY'RE SPECIALISED FOOD 
HAVE YOU CREATED A DISH WHICH IS ECONOMICAL 
AND WHICH CAN BE MASS PRODUCED IN FACTORY LIKE THIS ONE 
WE HAVE WE'RE ACTUALLY WORKING ON IT AT THE MOMENT WITH SCALLOP 
SERGE HAS COME WITH WAIT FOR IT 
THAT IS THE BIGGEST FISH FINGER I HAVE EVER SEEN SERGE 
AN OLD RECIPE WITH A NEW TWIST 
WHAT'S INSIDE HERE 
INSIDE WE GOT SOME MUSHY PEA 
WHICH IS A CLASSIC CLASSIC UM 
ACCOMPANIMENT WITH FISH AND CHIPS YEAH 
DO YOU MIND IF I PERFORM A SMALL AUTOPSY ON IT NOT AT ALL 
SO YOU'VE GOT A BATTER LAYER ON TOP YEP 
AND THAT'S THE POLLOCK THERE IS IT YES IT IS YEAH 
THEN INSIDE THERE'S THE MUSHY PEAS THE MUSHY PEAS YEP 
CAN I TRY A BIT YES YOU CAN 
LOOKS VERY HOT 
YEAH I PREFER THOSE TO FISH FINGERS YEAH YEAH 
THE MUSHY PEAS GIVES SOME STRONG FLAVOUR IT'S GOT A TANG IN THE MIDDLE 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO CALL THIS I DON'T KNOW JUMBO 
JUMBO MUSHY PEAS FINGERS JUMBO MUSHY PEAS FINGERS 
SORRY SERGE JUMBO MUSHY PEAS FINGERS IS NOT GOING TO WORK 
YOU NEED A GOOD NAME 
SOMETHING WE'RE WORKING ON YOU'VE GOT THE PRODUCT YOU NEED THE NAME 
LEAVING GRIMSBY WE FOLLOW THE FLAT WINDSWEPT COAST SOUTHWARDS INTO LINCOLNSHIRE 
GRIMSBY'S FISH FINGERS AND YOU NEVER KNOW 
MAYBE EVEN SERGE'S JUMBO MUSHY PEAS FINGERS MAY END UP BEING EATEN HERE 
AT ONE OF LINCOLNSHIRE'S BRACING SEASIDE RESORTS 
CLEETHORPES MABLETHORPE INGOLDMELLS 
TOGETHER THEY BOAST IF THAT'S THE RIGHT WORD THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF VANS IN EUROPE 
WITH SIXTY FIVE MILLION VISITORS EVERY YEAR 
THIS COAST'S FLAIR FOR INGENUITY AND INNOVATION IS NOWHERE MORE EVIDENT THAN HERE 
IN SKEGNESS 
ONE DAY THE FAIRGROUND SHOWMAN CAME UPON AN OLD TURNIP FIELD BY THE SEA 
AND THERE HE SAW GOLD 
HIS NAME WAS BILLY BUTLIN 
BUTLIN WAS ABOUT TO REVOLUTIONISE THE GREAT BRITISH HOLIDAY 
BY INVENTING THE MEGA CAMP 
BUTLIN'S SKEGNESS THE FIRST CAMP BILLY BUILT IS STILL PACKING THEM IN 
BOLD BRASH AND BRASSY AS EVER 
NEIL OLIVER HAS JOINED THE CROWD 
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME AT BUTLIN'S SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT'D BE LIKE 
BUT I THINK I EXPECTED IT TO BE WINDING DOWN 
BUT LOOK AT THIS PLACE IT'S JUMPING AND IT'S GOING LIKE A FAIR 
COME ON FEEL THE MUSIC 
IT'S PARTY TIME COME ON 
BILLY BUTLIN OPENED THIS PLACE IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX 
AND IT BECAME THE TEMPLATE FOR EVERY HOLIDAY CAMP IN THE COUNTRY 
EVEN TODAY JUST ABOUT WHEN YOU CAN GET A CHEAP HOLIDAY ANYWHERE 
FOUR MILLION OF US CHOOSE TO COME ON HOLIDAY TO SOMEWHERE LIKE THIS EVERY YEAR 
THE NAME BUTLIN'S HAS BEEN SYNONYMOUS WITH THE BRITISH SEASIDE HOLIDAY FOR SEVENTY YEARS 
BUT WHY DID IT ALL START HERE 
IT WAS IN SKEGNESS THAT BUTLIN OPENED HIS FIRST FUNFAIR IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN 
HE SAW THE OPPORTUNITY TO CATER FOR THE DAY TRIPPERS COMING HERE IN THEIR MASSES 
FROM THE INDUSTRIAL CITIES OF NOTTINGHAM DONCASTER AND LEICESTER 
I'M MEETING PROFESSOR VICTOR MIDDLETON AN EXPERT ON BRITISH TOURISM 
HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT THE SECRETS TO BILLY'S SUCCESS' 
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT BILLY THAT MADE HIM DIFFERENT 
I THINK HE WAS FIRST AND FOREMOST A BRILLIANT ENTREPRENEUR 
YOU KNOW THE DODGEMS STORY I DON'T 
HE WENT TO OLYMPIA IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN 
SAW AN U. S. MANUFACTURER DEMONSTRATE THESE CARS 
AND IMMEDIATELY WENT BACK INVESTED EVERY PENNY IN A FLEET OF DODGEMS IN SKEGNESS 
NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT WAS THE FIRST SEASON AND THEN HE MANAGED YOU SAW HOW POPULAR THEY WERE 
HE GOT THE SOLE AGENCY FOR SELLING DODGEMS IN U. K. AND WHOLE OF EUROPE 
THAT IS SHEER GENIUS ABSOLUTELY 
SO THE MONEY THAT HE MADE FROM DODGEMS BUILT EVERYTHING ELSE IT WAS A KEY PART OF THE WHOLE EMPIRE 
AN EMPIRE BUILT ON DODGEMS YEAH THEY'RE STILL MY FAVOURITE THING 
BILLY BUTLIN'S TIMING WAS PERFECT 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT THE HOLIDAY WITH PAY ACT WAS PASSED 
THIS YEAR WE'VE GOT HOLIDAYS WITH PAY LOOK AT THAT 
WHOO ISN'T THAT LOVELY 
HOLIDAYS WITH PAY WHO SAYS THE WORLD DOESN'T PROGRESS 
NOT EVERY BUSINESS PAYS THIS PREMIUM YET 
BUT A START HAS BEEN MADE AND WHAT HAS LONG BEEN AN OFFICE PRIVILEGE WILL BECOME THE RULE IN FACTORIES 
THE HOLIDAY EXODUS HAS BEGUN SO A HAPPY TIME TO ALL OF YOU 
FOR THE FIRST TIME 
MILLIONS OF ORDINARY WORKERS HAD A WEEK'S PAID HOLIDAY AND WANTED SOMEWHERE CHEAP TO GO IN THE SUMMER 
BUTLIN'S MASTERSTROKE WAS TO OFFER THE MASSES AN ALL INCLUSIVE SEASIDE HOLIDAY FOR A WEEK'S WAGE 
AND BY PROVIDING ALL THE FACILITIES AND ENTERTAINMENT ON SITE 
THE HOLIDAY MAKERS WOULD NEVER NEED TO LEAVE THE CAMP 
THE ORIGINAL CAMPERS STAYED IN BASIC WOODEN CHALETS LIKE THESE 
THOUGH THE CHALETS WERE SMALL THE CAMP WAS ON A SCALE NOT SEEN BEFORE 
ACCOMMODATING OVER TWO THOUSAND HOLIDAY MAKERS 
SO THIS IS THE ORIGINAL HOME FROM HOME THEN YES I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE LAST 
OF THE ORIGINAL NINETEEN THIRTY SIX CHALETS OF WHICH THERE WERE HUNDREDS IN LINES AROUND THE CAMP AT THAT TIME 
WE'LL HAVE A LOOK INSIDE 
I'LL HAVE TO SAY VICTOR IT'S NOT SAYING LUXURY HOLIDAY TO ME 
NO I THINK TO BE FAIR IT IS LOOKING A LITTLE BIT SAD 
AT THE PRESENT TIME LISTED BUILDING THOUGH IT IS 
BUT IT'S GOT EVERYTHING PEOPLE NEEDED THEY HAD SINGLE BEDS 
BASIC FURNITURE A MIRROR A SINGLE LIGHT BULB 
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SORT OF CONDITIONS THAT PEOPLE LIVED IN AT THAT TIME 
THEIR HOUSES THE INDUSTRIAL SMOG VERY SMALL HOUSES OVERCROWDED 
THIS WOULD HAVE SEEMED LIKE A HOLIDAY HEAVEN TO PEOPLE PERHAPS COMING FOR THEIR FIRST EVER HOLIDAY 
AND SO YOU'D HAVE A WHOLE FAMILY IN HERE YES BUT THEN THEY WERE USED TO DOING THAT 
IN BOARDING HOUSES YOU WOULD HAVE HAD ROOMS WITH FIVE OR SIX PEOPLE IN 
IT'S THE WAY PEOPLE TOOK HOLIDAYS AT THAT TIME 
AMAZING M. M. M. I'M AMAZED 
YES 
SO WHAT WAS THE DAILY ROUTINE HERE FOR THE CAMPERS 
WELL RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING BREAKFAST WOULD HAVE BEEN ARRANGED IN A FAIRLY REGIMENTED WAY 
IT WAS THE MASS CATERING 
THEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SERIES OF ACTIVITIES ALL ANNOUNCED OVER A TANNOY SYSTEM 
THE REMAINDER OF YOUR AFTERNOON PROGRAMME IS EXACTLY AS PRINTED 
SO GO OUT AND ENJOY YOURSELVES AND HAVE A GOOD TIME 
THIS IS GEORGE SAYING BYE BYE 
SO IF PEOPLE WANTED IT VIRTUALLY EVERY HOUR WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN UP 
WITH THE HOLIDAY ARRANGEMENTS WHICH WERE PROVIDED AND THAT OF COURSE 
WAS COMPLETELY UNUSUAL AND A NEW PART OF THE BUTLIN PLAN 
BUT THE CAMPERS' FUN CAME TO AN ABRUPT HALT WITH THE START OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE 
NOT ONE TO MISS A TRICK THE EVER RESOURCEFUL BUTLIN HIRED OUT THE SITE TO THE MILITARY 
AND BUTLIN'S SKEGNESS BECAME A NAVAL CAMP 
WHEN THE WAR ENDED THE TROOPS WERE REPLACED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY 
BY AN ARMY OF HOLIDAY MAKERS IN EVEN BIGGER NUMBERS EAGER TO LET THEIR HAIR DOWN AFTER WARTIME AUSTERITY 
AS A RESULT MORE AND MORE HOLIDAY CAMPS OPENED 
PONTIN'S AND WARNER'S ALSO CAPITALISED ON THE TREND 
BUTLIN'S WAS THE MARKET LEADER AND SEEMED UNSTOPPABLE 
BY NINETEEN SIXTY SIX BILLY'S EMPIRE HAD GROWN FROM ONE CAMP TO NINE 
AND IT'S ADVERTISING PULLED IN EVEN MORE VISITORS 
HERE'S YOUR TEA MISS SALES OH THANK YOU 
GOSH ISN'T THIS EXCITING I DO ENVY YOU YOUR JOB YES I MUST ADMIT I DO LOVE IT 
AND FOR HOLIDAYS YOU CAN STOP OFF ANYWHERE YOU LIKE IN THE WORLD 
WELL I COULD BUT I DON'T I ALWAYS GO TO BUTLIN'S 
INSTEAD OF HONOLULU YES YOU SEE BUTLIN'S CAN NEVER NEVER BE A LETDOWN 
YOU KNOW FOR A START THAT YOU'RE CERTAIN TO MEET A GANG OF YOUNG PEOPLE 
SO YOU'RE BOUND TO FIND FRIENDS 
AND IT'S FOR SURE YOU'LL NEVER GET BORED 
STOP THE PLANE I'M GETTING OFF FOR BUTLIN'S NOT THIS TRIP PERHAPS BUT NEXT TIME 
THIS BOOM PERIOD FOR BRITISH HOLIDAY CAMPS PEAKED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO WITH SIX MILLION VISITORS 
BUT THE BUBBLE WAS ABOUT TO BURST 
BY THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES PACKAGE HOLIDAYS TO THE MED TOOK THEIR TOLL ON THE OLD FASHIONED CAMPS 
AFTER FORTY YEARS OF UNRIVALLED SUCCESS BUTLIN'S NEEDED TO REINVENT ITSELF 
IF IT WAS GOING TO SURVIVE 
AN ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN FROM NINETEEN NINETY TWO SHOWS JUST HOW DETERMINED THEY WERE 
TO BLAST AWAY THE IMAGE OF THE TIRED OLD HOLIDAY CAMP 
A HOLIDAY EXPERIENCE IS BORN 
THE REGIMENTED KEEP FIT CLASSES AND PRE PLANNED SING ALONGS HAVE ALL GONE 
AND THE CHALETS HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY APARTMENTS LIKE THIS 
THE REINVENTION SEEMS TO BE WORKING OVER A MILLION VISITORS CAME TO BUTLIN'S LAST YEAR 
IT'S THEIR SEVENTIETH ANNIVERSARY NEXT YEAR 
BUT I WONDER IF IT WILL ALL STILL BE HERE IN ANOTHER SEVENTY YEARS 
I THINK SOME OF IT WILL BE MUCH THE SAME 
IN THE SENSE THAT THE BEACHES WILL STILL BE HERE GIVE OR TAKE WHAT GLOBAL WARMING DOES 
THE RESORTS WILL STILL BE HERE BECAUSE I SEE NO REASON WHY PEOPLE 
WILL NOT WANT TO SPEND LEISURE TIME IN ATTRACTIVE ENVIRONMENTS 
AND THE TYPE OF ACCOMMODATION WILL CHANGE 
THE TYPE OF MEALS WILL CHANGE THE TYPE OF ENTERTAINMENT WILL CHANGE 
AND POSSIBLY ANOTHER BRILLIANT ENTREPRENEUR WILL COME ALONG 
WITH A TOTALLY DIFFERENT IDEA AND WILL CHANGE THE MOULD AGAIN 
DO YOU THINK THEY CAN CHANGE THE WEATHER 
NO THAT WOULD BE A VERY TALL ORDER I WOULDN'T GUARANTEE THAT 
BUTLIN'S IS A SURVIVOR 
DESPITE ALL THE COMPETITION IT'S HUNG ON CHANGING WITH THE TIMES 
BUT PERHAPS WHAT IS SAYS MORE THAN ANYTHING IS 
THAT PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS WANT TO BE BESIDE THE SEASIDE 
EVEN IF IT IS COLD WET AND WINDY 
JUST FOUR MILES DOWN THE COAST FROM SKEGGY 
WE COME TO A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF SEASIDE 
FROM HERE ON IT BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFINE WHERE THE LAND ENDS AND WHERE THE SEA BEGINS 
IT'S A COAST IN A CONSTANT STATE OF FLUX 
THIS IS THE SALT MARSH OF THE WASH ONE OF BRITAIN'S LAST GREAT WILDERNESSES 
WITH HALF A MILLION MIGRATING BIRDS PASSING THROUGH EVERY YEAR 
ARTISTS AND CONSERVATIONIST SIR PETER SCOTT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO RECOGNISE ITS IMPORTANCE 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE SCOTT CAME TO LIVE AT THIS LIGHTHOUSE ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER NENE WHERE IT ENTERS THE WASH 
AS A PAINTER HE WAS DRAWN TO THE BEAUTY AND THE EXTRAORDINARY VARIETY OF MIGRATING BIRDS 
AND THROUGH HIS ART 
HE INCREASED HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIRDS' BEHAVIOUR 
BUT SCOTT'S INTEREST IN WILDFOWL WASN'T JUST IN PAINTING THEM 
IT WAS ALSO IN SHOOTING THEM 
I'D NEVER REALLY THOUGHT SERIOUSLY ABOUT THE CONFLICT OF EMOTION OR INTEREST IN KILLING 
AND IN ENJOYING THE BIRDS ALIVE 
IT WAS A NATURAL THING ALMOST A NOBLE THING TO BE TRYING TO OUTWIT THEM 
THE CARNAGE OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR WAS TO SHIFT SCOTT'S PERSPECTIVE 
BEFORE THE WAR I'D BEEN A TREMENDOUSLY KEEN WILDFOWLER 
AND AFTER THE WAR I WAS NO LESS INTERESTED IN THE BIRDS THEMSELVES 
BUT I WAS MUCH LESS KEEN ON DESTRUCTION I THINK I'D HAD ENOUGH OF THAT DURING THE WAR 
AND SO I DECIDED TO GIVE UP THE SPORTING PART 
AND SIMPLY CONCENTRATE ON STUDYING AND PAINTING 
AND IF POSSIBLE HELPING TO CONSERVE THESE MARVELLOUS BIRDS 
ONE OF THE INNOVATIVE CONSERVATION METHODS HE INTRODUCED 
WAS THE RINGING PROGRAMME USING CANNON NETS 
TO CAPTURE THE BIRDS AND TAG THEM 
EVENTUALLY HE WENT ON TO FOUND THE WILDFOWL AND WETLANDS TRUST 
WHICH PROTECTS AND MANAGES THE U. K.'S PRECIOUS WILDLIFE HABITATS 
AND IT'S STILL GROWING STRONG 
OUR ZOOLOGIST MIRANDA KRESTOVNIKOFF 
HAS COME TO THE MARSHES OF THE WASH 
TO SEE SIR PETER SCOTT'S LEGACY IN ACTION 
AND TO MEET ORNITHOLOGIST SARAH DAWKINS 
A MEMBER OF THE WASH WADER RINGING GROUP 
THE WASH IS THIS HUGE EXPANSE OF MUD FLATS 
THEY'RE PACKED FULL OF FOOD THAT THE BIRDS CAN EAT 
THAT'S WHY IN WINTER WE'VE GOT SOMETHING LIKE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND BIRDS HERE 
THEY'RE EATING THE FOOD THAT'S IN THE MUD FLATS 
ESTUARY MUD IS SO FULL OF FOOD 
THAT IT ATTRACTS HUGE FLOCKS OF WADING BIRDS 
WHEN THE TIDE COMES IN IT PUSHES THE BIRDS OFF THE MUD FLATS 
CREATING ONE OF THE U. K.'S GREAT WILDLIFE SPECTACLES 
BUT SARAH HASN'T COME JUST TO LOOK AT THE BIRDS HER GROUP COMES HERE EVERY MONTH TO CATCH AND RING THEM 
AND IT'S ONLY AT HIGH TIDE WHEN THE BIRDS ARE CONCENTRATED IN ONE PLACE 
AT THE TOP OF THE BEACH THAT THEY STAND ANY CHANCE OF DOING THIS 
THE PLAN IS TO FIRE A CANNON NET 
ADAPTED FROM THE ONE INVENTED BY SIR PETER SCOTT OVER THE GROUP OF BIRDS 
IT'S A TRICKY OPERATION 
AND HIDDEN BEHIND THE SEA WALL 
WE ALL WAIT ANXIOUSLY FOR THE NET TO BE FIRED 
FIRE 
THE GROUP HAVE WORKED TOGETHER FOR SO LONG THAT THEY OPERATE LIKE A WELL OILED MACHINE 
AND AS SOON AS THE NETS ARE FIRED EVERYONE SPRINTS INTO ACTION 
THE NETS HAVE GOT TO BE LIFTED AWAY FROM THE APPROACHING TIDE AND THEN COVERED 
ONCE THEY'RE IN THE DARK THEY CALM DOWN THEY DON'T GET TOO DISTRESSED 
EXACTLY NOW YOU CAN LEAVE THEM HERE WE CAN SORT OURSELVES OUT 
WE CAN GET SOME CAGES THINK ABOUT AND CALM DOWN IT WAS DRAMATIC WASN'T IT 
ONE OF THE REASONS FOR NETTING THE BIRDS IS TO SEE IF THEY'VE BEEN CAUGHT HERE BEFORE 
IF NOT THEY GIVE THE BIRDS AN IDENTIFYING RING 
OH MY HANDS ARE SO COLD I CAN'T SQUEEZE 
WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RINGS IT'S GOT A NUMBER AND AN ADDRESS 
IT'S UNIQUE TO THIS BIRD ANYONE IN THE WORLD WHO CATCHES THIS BIRD 
CAN CONTACT THAT ADDRESS 
AND FIND OUT THIS BIRD WAS RINGED ON THE WASH TODAY 
THEY'RE SO EASY TO HANDLE AREN'T THEY THE RINGING I'VE DONE IN THE PAST HAS BEEN FRANTIC 
BECAUSE THE BIRDS ARE A BIT SKIPPY AND NOT HAPPY BEING HANDLED 
BUT THIS IS VERY EASY WADERS ARE MUCH CALMER THAN OTHER BIRDS 
WHICH MAKES IT EASY FOR US TO DEAL WITH THEM IN THIS WAY 
IN ORDER TO MINIMISE STRESS WE RELEASE THE OYSTER CATCHERS AS SOON AS WE'VE RINGED AND MEASURED THEM 
WE JUST LITERALLY PICK THEM UP AND POP THEM OUT 
AND THEN OFF THEY GO 
WHAT THE RESEARCH OF THE WASH WADER RINGING GROUP HAS SHOWN 
IS THAT MOST OF THESE BIRDS ARE ON HUGE MIGRATIONS 
BREEDING IN THE SUMMER IN THE HIGH ARCTIC 
AND THEN TRAVELLING SOUTH SOME AS FAR AS AFRICA IN THE WINTER 
IT'S ALWAYS NICE RELEASING THEM AND REALISING YOU'VE NOT DAMAGED OR AFFECTED THEM IN ANY WAY 
AND FOR THE BIRDS TO MAKE THESE MIGRATIONS 
OUR ESTUARIES ARE VITAL 
THE BIRDS USE THEM LIKE SERVICE STATIONS ON A MOTORWAY 
IF THEY CAN'T STOP OFF AND REFUEL THEY'RE UNABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR MIGRATION 
BUT RISING SEA LEVELS THREATEN ESTUARIES LIKE THIS 
FOR THE FUTURE OF THESE BIRDS WE'LL HAVE TO THINK LONG AND HARD 
ABOUT HOW TO PROTECT PLACES LIKE THE WASH 
THE QUICKSANDS AND THE QUAGMIRES OF THE WASH'S FICKLE LANDSCAPE 
ARE ALSO THE STUFF OF LEGEND 
THIS IS THE MUD THAT EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS AGO SWALLOWED THE TREASURE OF BAD KING JOHN 
IT'S AUTUMN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN AND KING JOHN IS IN THE FINAL DAYS OF A BITTER STRUGGLE AGAINST REBEL BARONS 
HE'S LOST LONDON AND IS TRYING TO MOUNT A LAST STRIKE AGAINST THE REBEL HEARTLAND IN EAST ANGLIA 
EFFECTIVELY HOMELESS HE'S CARRYING EVERYTHING WITH HIM 
INCLUDING THE CROWN JEWELS 
THE KING TOOK THE LONGER BUT SAFER INLAND ROUTE AROUND THE WASH 
BUT SENT HIS SLOW MOVING BAGGAGE TRAIN TOGETHER WITH THE JEWELS 
ON THE MORE DANGEROUS DIRECT ROUTE ACROSS THE MARSHES 
NAVIGATION ON THE WASH WOULD HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT THERE ARE NO NOTABLE FEATURES 
AND WATER IN CREEKS LIKE THESE RISES QUICKLY WITH THE TIDE 
THE STORY GOES THAT THEY MISTIMED THE CROSSING AND GOT CAUGHT BY THE INCOMING TIDE 
CHRONICLER RALF OF COGGESHALL SAID MANY MEMBERS OF JOHN'S HOUSEHOLD WERE SUBMERGED IN THE SEA 
AND SUCKED INTO THE QUICKSAND 
THE TREASURE WENT DOWN WITH THEM 
BUT DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF HOPEFUL TREASURE HUNTERS DOWN THE CENTURIES 
KING JOHN'S CROWN JEWELS HAVE NEVER BEEN FOUND 
THE MUD FLATS THAT CONSUMED THE TREASURE STRETCHED ABOUT FOUR MILES ACROSS THE WASH 
BUT ALL THAT HAS NOW BECOME FIRM FERTILE LAND 
WELCOME TO THE FENS 
OVER THE LAST EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS HUMAN INTERVENTION AND INVENTION 
HAVE ALTERED THE LINE OF THE COAST AND COMPLETELY CHANGED THE FACE OF THIS LANDSCAPE 
AT THE TIME OF KING JOHN THE FENS STRETCHED FORTY MILES ALONG THIS COAST 
AND TWENTY MILES INLAND 
BUT NOT ANY LONGER 
MAISIE TAYLOR A LOCAL ARCHAEOLOGIST 
KNOWS WHAT BROUGHT ABOUT THIS DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE FENS 
I CAN'T BEGIN TO IMAGINE WHAT THE FENS MUST HAVE LOOKED LIKE 
FOUR HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE LOOKED LIKE HOW BIG WERE THEY AND HOW DIFFICULT WAS IT TO TRAVEL 
THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY VAST WHICH WAS WONDERFUL FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED HERE AND EXPLOITED IT 
BUT FOR OUTSIDERS IT WAS AN EVIL GODFORSAKEN PLACE 
WHAT MAKES A FEN SO FERTILE TO SOME EXTENT IT'S THE SILTS AND SEDIMENTS THAT WASH IN 
BUT MOSTLY IT'S LIKE A COMPOST HEAP JUST LEAVES AND STEMS 
AND SOFT PARTS OF PLANTS 
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THE FENS ARE JUST A GIANT GROW BAG 
TO TURN THIS GIANT GROW BAG INTO FERTILE FARMLAND 
SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ENGINEERS CAME UP WITH THIS 
SOFT LINES BECAME SHARP MEANDERING CURVES BECAME STRAIGHT 
THE MARSHLANDS WERE DRAINED AND TAMED BY THE CREATION OF ARTIFICIAL WATERWAYS 
THESE RIVERS WERE PUT RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE FENS 
TO TAKE ALL THE WATER BY THE SHORTEST ROUTE TO THE SEA 
SO THIS IS A MAN MADE LANDSCAPE IT'S COMPLETELY MAN MADE 
AND THIS GOES RIGHT ACROSS THE FENS IT'S MASSIVE I KNOW EXTRAORDINARY ISN'T IT 
RECLAMATION FROM THE SEA CONTINUED UNTIL THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
AND CREATED OVER ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE MILES OF FARMLAND 
AN AREA ONE FIFTH THE SIZE OF WALES 
NO OTHER PART OF THE U. K. COASTLINE HAS BEEN AS EXTENSIVELY ALTERED BY HUMAN INTERVENTION 
FOR THE TIME BEING THIS IS THE FRONT LINE BETWEEN MAN AND THE SEA 
BUT WITH SEA LEVELS RISING THE QUESTION FOR THE FUTURE 
IS WHETHER TO DEFEND THIS MAN MADE LAND OR TO HAND IT BACK TO NATURE 
THIS AWESOMELY FLAT RECLAIMED LANDSCAPE IS A TRIBUTE TO MAN'S INGENUITY 
THIS PART OF THE EAST COAST REALLY DOES FEEL LIKE NOWHERE ELSE IN BRITAIN 
BUT OUR HOLD HERE IS PRECARIOUS 
IT'S NOT JUST FARMLAND ON THE FRONT LINE BUT ALSO LOW LYING TOWNS LIKE KING'S LYNN
