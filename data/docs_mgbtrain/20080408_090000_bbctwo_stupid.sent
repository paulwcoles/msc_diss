PARTICULARLY STUPID BUT AS LONG AS YOU THOUGHT I WAS GOOD THAT'S O. K. 
I'M KING STUPID OF COURSE THE KING 
I HATE GRAFFITI 
I HATE GRAFFITI BECAUSE IT AFFECTS LOADS OF PEOPLE IN THIS COMMUNITY 
IT MAKES THE PLACE LOOK WORSE 
MY FRIEND FEELS THE SAME WAY I DO 
GRAFFITI MESSES UP THE STREETS AND IT TAKES MONEY TO CLEAN IT UP 
USUALLY IT'S USED IN A BAD WAY ON WALLS PAVEMENTS COUNCIL PROPERTY 
IT GETS OUT OF CONTROL WITH LIKE WORDS THAT ARE NOT VERY APPROPRIATE 
THIS IS MY BROTHER AND HE FEELS THE SAME WAY I DO ABOUT GRAFFITI 
I HATE GRAFFITI IT MAKES OUR AREA LOOK BAD 
NEAR OUR HOUSE THE BUS STOP HAS BEEN VANDALISED BY BREAKING WINDOWS 
EVERYTHING ON THE GROUND GRAFFITI ON THE CHAIRS 
WHEN I SEE IT IT MAKES ME FEEL SAD 
GRAFFITI IS DONE MOSTLY BY TEENAGERS 
I THINK THEY DO IT COS THEY'RE BORED 
IT DISTURBS PEOPLE AND MAKES THEM FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE AREA 
IT AFFECTS THE NEIGHBOURS THEY LIVE NEXT TO A WALL COVERED IN GRAFFITI 
I WANT TO STOP IT AND MAKE PEOPLE THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
AND ASK THEM WHY THEY'RE DOING IT 
I CLEAN THE GRAFFITI WITH MY BROOM 
THERE SHOULD BE A SPECIAL PLACE FOR GRAFFITI A GRAFFITI ART GALLERY 
THE COUNCIL SHOULD TAKE MORE ACTION 
PEOPLE CAN SEE IT IF THEY WANT TO NOT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO 
THE PEOPLE WHO GRAFFITI SHOULD BE PUNISHED 
THIS IS HOW YOU CLEAN GRAFFITI UP 
THAT'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT GRAFFITI 
THESE ARE NO ORDINARY KIDS 
THEY'RE SUPERKIDS GENETICALLY DESIGNED TO BEAT ADULTS 
JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN I'VE GOT QUITE A LOT STORED UP HERE 
I'M TWENTY SIX HE'S THIRTEEN SO ACCORDING TO ME HE'S HALF AS INTELLIGENT 
YOU WANNA FIND OUT WHO WINS 
JOIN US AND SEE IF THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT
