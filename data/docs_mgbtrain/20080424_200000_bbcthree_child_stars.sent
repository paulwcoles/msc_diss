RICHMOND SURREY IS HOME TO A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD WHO TO WANTS TO PUT THE GREAT BACK INTO BRITISH TENNIS 
MY NAME'S OLIVER GOLDING AND MY AMBITION IS TO BE NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD OF TENNIS 
BASICALLY MY DREAM IS TO WIN ANY GRAND SLAM AND IF I COULD PICK ONE OF COURSE IT WOULD BE WIMBLEDON 
IN ORDER TO BE NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD I'M GOING TO HAVE 
TO BE BETTER THAN FEDERER OR NADAL SO YOU'VE GOT TO BE TALENTED AND YOU'VE GOT TO WORK 
OLIVER LIVES WITH MUM SANDRA A TENNIS COACH 
AND THE HOUSE HAS EVERYTHING A BUDDING TENNIS STAR NEEDS 
THIS IS THE GYM 
WELL SORT OF STUDIO NOT EXACTLY A GYM 
IT'S JUST A LITTLE STUDIO FOR DOING PRESS UPS SIT UPS AND WHATEVER IN HERE 
MOST HOUSES ALONG THIS ROAD HAVE THE SAME SORT OF GARDEN UP TO HERE BUT WE'VE GOT A LITTLE EXTRA BIT 
AND THIS IS WHERE I LEARNT MY TRADE 
THE BACK GARDEN 
REMEMBER THE NAME BY FORT MINOR 
I LOVE IT BECAUSE I'M COMPETITIVE FOR A START 
AND I LOVE HITTING TENNIS BALLS 
IT'S A REALLY NICE FEELING 
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE WHO'S ADDICTED TO COCAINE I'M ADDICTED TO HITTING A TENNIS BALL 
THIS IS TEN PERCENT LUCK TWENTY PERCENT SKILL 
FIFTEEN PERCENT CONCENTRATED POWER OF WILL 
I LOVE HITTING IT AND MOST OF ALL I LOVE WINNING 
THAT'S AN UNBELIEVABLE FEELING 
OLIVER STARTED TENNIS BECAUSE HE HAD TO BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE 
A NANNY OR A BABYSITTER 
HE HAD TO COME TO WORK WITH ME EVERY DAY 
AS A BABY AND BY THE TIME HE WAS THREE OR FOUR HE WAS PLAYING TENNIS 
AND THEN AT FIVE SIX I THOUGHT HE'S REALLY GOOD 
I THOUGHT I'D LOOK AROUND FOR A TOURNAMENT TO PUT HIM IN SO 
I PUT HIM IN A MINI TOURNAMENT AND HE DID REALLY WELL 
THEN HE DECIDED HE LIKED THE IDEA OF WINNING AND HE'S LIKED WINNING EVER SINCE 
HE WANTED TO GO TO ANOTHER TOURNAMENT THEN ANOTHER TOURNAMENT IT JUST WENT FROM THERE 
BUT OLIVER HATES LOSING SO MUCH IT'S GETTING HIM INTO TROUBLE 
OLIVER COME HERE PLEASE 
IF YOU WANT TO PLAY TENNIS PLAY TENNIS 
STOP ALL THIS ACTING 
JUST GET ON WITH THE GAME 
ONE ELEVEN YEAR OLD CAN REMEMBER THE EXACT MOMENT SHE BEGAN TO DREAM OF FAME 
KEEKI BENNETTS WANTS TO BECOME A SUPERSTAR OF STAGE AND SCREEN 
I FELT LIKE THAT I WANTED TO BECOME FAMOUS WHEN I WAS ABOUT THREE YEARS OLD 
I WAS DOING A SHOW WHEN I WAS THREE AND I SUNG LOTS OF SONGS AND I HAD 
LOADS OF AUDIENCE CLAPPING AND I FELT REALLY 
EXITED BECAUSE I WAS VERY YOUNG AND I WANTED TO BECOME FAMOUS LIKE PEOPLE ON T. V. 
I WOULD LIKE TO BE ON STAGES PERFORMING TO THE WORLD AND THINGS AND HAVING A BIG HOUSE 
KEEKI LIVES WITH HER FAMILY IN FELTHAM MIDDLESEX 
THERE'S TEN OF US IN A FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE MY SISTERS DEMI SIGOURNI MEEMI ROSE AND FEEFI 
AND MY BROTHER KAI AND TWO LODGERS FRAN AND ELLIE THEY'RE SISTERS AND MY MUM AND DAD 
KEEKI'S NAMED AFTER POP STAR KIKI DEE DEMI AFTER DEMI MOORE 
HER OTHER SISTERS ARE NAMED AFTER CELEBRITIES TOO 
THEY'RE ALL ASPIRING PERFORMERS 
MUM SAM USED TO BE A DANCER AND FULLY SUPPORTS HER DAUGHTERS 
MY MUM HELPED ME A LOT 
SHE TAUGHT ME HOW TO DANCE AND SING AND THINGS AND THEN SHE TOOK ME TO DANCE SCHOOL AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
KEEKI FIRST IN SONG AND DANCE KEEKI FIRST IN SONG AND DANCE 
KEEKI MOST PROMISING PERFORMER 
MOST OF THESE ARE ALL KEEKI'S REALLY 
FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE WE SAW SOMETHING IN KEEKI 
EVERYONE SAW SOMETHING IN KEEKI AND THEY STILL DO 
I THINK SHE DOES WANT US TO BE FAMOUS BECAUSE THEN WE CAN HAVE A GOOD LIFE 
WE'LL NOT BE LIKE ANY FAMOUS PEOPLE WHO TAKE DRUGS AND THINGS 
WE'LL JUST HAVE A GOOD LIFE LOOK AFTER OUR FAMILY 
WATCH THIS WILL CRACK YOU UP 
SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW 
KEEKI IS ALREADY A SEASONED PERFORMER 
HER MUM HAS BEEN PUTTING HER UP FOR AUDITIONS SINCE SHE WAS VERY YOUNG 
A LAND THAT I'VE HEARD OF ONCE IN A LULLABY 
OH GOD 
AND THE THING IS THEY WERE SO GOOD AT THAT AGE AND NOW YOU LISTEN BACK IT'S AWFUL THAT'S NOT ME 
THAT'S A GIRL CALLED JUGJER 
BECAUSE I COULDN'T SING 
KEEKI AND HER SISTERS NOW ATTEND DRAMA SCHOOL 
THERE'S A STRANGE EXHILARATION 
CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN AFRICA THEIR DREAM IS LIKE TO HAVE A WARM HOME 
TO BE IN A SAFER PLACE BUT LIKE PEOPLE IN MY SCHOOL 
THEY DREAM OF BECOMING FAMOUS AND DOING WHAT THEY WANT TO DO 
ONE ELEVEN YEAR OLD'S AMBITION HAS SEEN HIM TAKEN OUT OF SCHOOL AND MOVED FAR FROM HOME 
MY NAME'S KALI 
I WANT TO BE A SKI RACER WHEN I'M OLDER 
I WANT TO BE THE FIRST BRIT TO WIN A WORLD CUP RACE 
I'VE COME TO VERBIER IN SWITZERLAND 
AND I'M OUT HERE FOR THE SEASON 
ALL THE KIDS THAT ARE GOOD AT SKIING AT THE BEST LEVEL 
THEY LIVED IN THE MOUNTAINS SO WE'VE GOT TO DO THAT AS WELL 
SO THAT I CAN BECOME A SKI RACER AS WELL 
KALI CONNERY AND HIS DAD ARE ON A TIGHT BUDGET 
AND ARE STAYING IN A FRIEND'S HOUSE ALONG WITH OTHER GUESTS 
THIS IS TOM 
G'DAY 
HE'S AUSTRALIAN 
AND THIS IS MY DAD 
HIYA 
I STARTED BECOMING INTERESTED AT THE END OF LAST WINTER 
I SAID I REALLY WANT TO BE A RACER AND YOU SAID SHALL WE GO FOR THE SEASON THEN 
MY BACKGROUND IS SKI RACING SO KALI 
THROUGH MY INFLUENCE HAS SKIED SINCE HE WAS EIGHTEEN MONTHS OLD 
I NEVER REALLY MADE IT IN SKI RACING SIMPLY BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE 
THE MONEY OR THE BACKING WHEN I WAS YOUNGER 
SO BASICALLY I DECIDED TO NOT WORK FOR CLOSE TO FOUR MONTHS I THINK IT WILL BE TO ALLOW KALI TO DO THAT 
IT'S A HUGE LIFE EXPERIENCE FOR US BOTH 
AND A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR KALI AND LET'S HOPE FOR HIS SAKE 
THAT HE REALLY TAKES IT AND AND DOES WELL WITH IT I'M SURE HE WILL 
GARY IS A STUNT MAN AND SKIING ISN'T THE ONLY THING KALI'S LEARNED FROM HIM 
THREE TWO ONE GO K. A. L. GO 
KALI'S BEEN A DAREDEVIL SINCE HE WAS THREE 
HE'S EVEN DONE STUNT WORK HIMSELF 
I'VE DONE 
SEVEN DIFFERENT JOBS AND I'VE DONE ONE THAT WAS WHERE MY DAD 
CHUCKED ME OUT OF A BURNING BOAT HOUSE 
INTO A HAY BARREL 
I DID A JERK BACK 
I DID 
A BOMB EXPLODED AND I HAD TO JUMP AS THOUGH 
I WAS UM 
BLOWN AWAY 
KALI CAN EARN FIVE HUNDRED A DAY DOING STUNTS BUT DESPITE THIS HE SEES HIS FUTURE ON THE SNOW 
EVERYTHING OUT HERE IS EXCITING 
IT'S JUST AMAZING BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE FOR MILES WHEN YOU'RE 
UP ON THE MOUNTAINS ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE AT THE HIGHEST 
YOU CAN SEE DOWN IN ALL THE VALLEYS 
IT'S A VERY BIG EXPERIENCE FOR ME 
HI HO HI HO IT'S OFF TO SKI WE GO 
BUT THIS IS NO HOLIDAY FOR KALI 
K. A. L. COME ON GET A GRIP GET A GRIP 
WHAT HAPPENED MATE I SLIPPED 
COME ON MATE PICK THEM UP CLIP THEM TOGETHER 
GOOD LET'S GO 
I'VE TOLD YOU THIS BEFORE HAVEN'T I 
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS TRAIN THE SAME AS YOU'RE GONNA RACE 
GOTTA GET THAT INTO YOUR HEAD MATE AND THEN YOU'LL GO WINNING 
WE'RE GONNA GO RACE TRAINING ON THE STADE 
IT'S A G. S. TODAY 
WE DO THREE HOURS OF RACE TRAINING 
I LIKE GOING THROUGH THE GATES AND YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A PRECISE MOMENT WHERE TO TURN 
YOU GET TO GO FAST AND YOU JUST GET A GREAT BUZZ WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE DOING WELL 
I WAS VERY SURPRISED ABOUT HIS LEVEL 
HE'S ENGLISH AND HE'S GOT A GOOD LEVEL HE CAN SKI WITH THE CHILDRENS FROM HERE 
HE HAS THE SAME LEVEL SOMETIMES BETTER 
BUT BECOMING FAMOUS REQUIRES MORE THAN JUST TALENT 
COME ON GIRLS UP YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE MOVE IT 
IT'S QUARTER PAST SIX 
IT'S MONDAY MORNING AND THE START OF ANOTHER LONG WEEK FOR KEEKI BENNETTS 
I'LL GET UP AND I JUST FEEL SO EXHAUSTED AND THINGS SO I GET DRESSED AND BRUSH MY TEETH 
AND I'LL HAVE BREAKFAST AND I FALL BACK TO SLEEP IN MY BED 
YOU'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES GIRLS 
KEEKI'S DAYS WHICH CAN BE FOURTEEN HOURS LONG 
BEGIN WITH A NINETY MINUTE JOURNEY TO RAVENSCOURT THEATRE SCHOOL IN WEST LONDON 
OUR SCHOOL IS DIFFERENT FROM A NORMAL SCHOOL BECAUSE AT MY SCHOOL WE HAVE THE MORNING WITH JUST ACADEMIC STUFF 
AND THEN THE AFTERNOON WITH SINGING DANCING OR ACTING 
OH MY GOD I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S YOU 
AT THE END OF SCHOOL KEEKI BEGINS REHEARSALS FOR A CABARET SHE'S IN 
THAT OPENS IN TWO WEEKS' TIME 
KEEKI'S MUM SAM IS HELPING TO CHOREOGRAPH THE SHOW ALONGSIDE ADAM COLEMAN A PROFESSIONAL DANCER 
MY MUM USED TO BE IN THE BALLET RAMBERT WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD 
BUT THEN SHE HURT HER BACK DOING GYMNASTICS 
SHE WAS ON A BEAM AND SHE DONE A FLIP AND SHE FELL 
SHE HURT HER BACK AND SHE COULDN'T DANCE ANY MORE 
AFTER THE CABARET SHE HAS EXTRA TUITION SEVERAL NIGHTS A WEEK 
AFTER SCHOOL I DO EXTRA DANCE CLASSES 
ONE TWO IN 
O. K. AND THEN IT KIND OF SPRINGS 
I'M WORKING VERY HARD BUT I ENJOY IT BECAUSE IT'S LOTS OF FUN TO DO 
AND WHEN YOU GROW UP IT'S GOOD TO HAVE ALL OF THIS IN YOUR BACKGROUND 
EYES UP KEEKI 
SO MY DAY IS QUITE BUSY AND WHEN I GET HOME IT'S LIKE TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT 
EVEN AFTER A FULL DAY OF SCHOOL REHEARSALS AND EXTRA DANCE CLASSES 
KEEKI AND HER FAMILY CAN STILL END UP PRACTISING THE CABARET INTO THE NIGHT 
IN SWITZERLAND KALI'S DAY IS JUST AS DEMANDING 
WHEN HE ISN'T RACE TRAINING AT SKI SCHOOL HE'S COACHED BY HIS DAD 
I WANT HIM TO ENJOY HIMSELF DON'T GET ME WRONG 
BUT WE'RE HERE TO TRAIN IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BEING ON A JOLLY 
YOU KNOW WHAT WE WERE TAKING ABOUT ON THE LIFT ABOUT GENERATING MORE SPEED 
I TRY TO LISTEN TO EVERYONE WHEN THEY ARE SAYING 
TO ME MY TECHNIQUES I NEED TO CHANGE AND THEN I TRY AND PUT IT INTO PRACTICE 
ALLOW THE SKIS TO RUN STRAIGHT 
THIS IS GOING TO GENERATE A LOT OF SPEED BEFORE WE THEN KICK INTO OUR NEXT TURN 
WHEN SKIING IS OVER TRAINING DOESN'T STOP 
LET'S GO MUSH FACE 
READY 
LET'S GO 
STOP MESSING AROUND MATE GO 
WELL DONE 
MY FATHER DOES PUSH ME QUITE HARD 
HE'S ALWAYS SHOUTING AT ME WHEN WE'RE DOING SPRINTS 
AND THE FOUR MILE RUN 
HE'S ALWAYS PUSHING ME AND SHOUTING COME ON 
COME ON MATE LET'S GO 
COME ON 
TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH HIM 
THREE PRESS UPS THEN HOP 
YOU CHOOSE WHICH LEG 
A BIG PART OF IT IS STRENGTH IN BODY BUT ALSO IN MIND 
QUICK AS YOU CAN EVERYBODY WORKS AT A HIGHER LEVEL IF THEY'VE GOT SOMEONE ENCOURAGING THEM 
COME ON YOU'RE NEARLY THERE 
BACKWARD JUMPS 
I DON'T FEEL THAT I'M PUSHING KALI 
WHAT I FEEL I'M DOING IS ENCOURAGING HIM TO 
TRAIN AS HARD AS HE CAN TRAIN 
STAND UP STRAIGHT SUCK IT IN 
TEN PRESS UPS FACING UP THE HILL 
AND THEN DOUBLE FOOTED JUMPS ALL THE WAY UP FACING FORWARDS 
I SHOUT BACK AT HIM IN MY HEAD BUT I DON'T SHOUT IT OUT LOUD 
I DON'T PUT A HUGE AMOUNT OF EMPHASIS ON THE RUNNING OR THE SPRINT SIDE OF THINGS AT THE MOMENT 
KALI'S STILL SMALL 
HE'S GOT A LOT PHYSICALLY TO DEVELOP YET 
WE PROBABLY DO THAT THREE TO FOUR TIMES A WEEK 
THIS HILL MY DAD BEASTS ME UP 
HE BEASTS ME FROM THERE TO HERE 
WHAT DOES BEAST MEAN 
HE SAYS COME ON K. A. L. 
AND DOESN'T GIVE ME A CHANCE 
YOU SEE WHERE THAT RED AND BLUE POLE IS 
AND WE'VE ALREADY DONE ABOUT ELEVEN SPIRITS UP ANOTHER HILL JUST DOWN THERE 
IT'S QUITE TIRING 
I ONLY ENJOY IT BECAUSE I KNOW I'M GOING TO GET FITTER 
SO I CAN SKI RACE 
BUT WHEN I'M ACTUALLY DOING IT IT'S NOT FUN 
NOW TAKE ALL YOUR CLOTHES OFF AND ROLL AROUND IN THE SNOW 
PARDON TAKE ALL YOUR CLOTHES OFF AND ROLL DOWN THE HILL IN THE SNOW 
O. K. 
HE WOULD AS WELL HE'D SEE IT AS PART OF TOUGHENING UP TRAINING 
HE JUST TAKES IT TOTALLY ON FACE VALUE WHICH IS WONDERFUL 
SO YOU CAN REALLY HAVE A PLAY WITH HIM 
K. A. L. YEP 
DO YOU WANT TO GRAB YOUR MATHS BOOK AND GET ON WITH DOING SOME MATHS 
COME ON LAD 
EVEN AFTER A HARD DAY THERE'S NO ESCAPING SCHOOLWORK 
I HAVE TO DO TWO HOURS A DAY JUST FOCUSING ON SCHOOL WORK 
IT'S JUST LIKE A NORMAL SCHOOL DAY EXCEPT IT'S A LITTLE BIT SHORTER 
KALI WANTS TO BE FIRST IN EVERYTHING HE DOES SO ALTHOUGH HE MAY NOT SEE 
SCHOOLING AS HIS NUMBER ONE PRIORITY 
HE SEES COMING FIRST AS HIS NUMBER ONE PRIORITY SO HE PUTS THE EFFORT IN 
OOH 
A BIT OF BLOOD IN YOUR DINNER TONIGHT K. A. L. 
WHY 
NEARLY CHOPPED MY FINGER OFF 
BEING AWAY FROM HOME IS VERY HARD COS I MISS MY MUM AND MY SISTER 
AND MY FRIENDS AT SCHOOL 
THE DISTANCE WE ARE AWAY AS WELL MAKES IT HARD TO JUST GO BACK FOR A WEEKEND OR SOMETHING 
BUT IT'S ALSO VERY FUN ON THE OTHER SIDE BECAUSE I LIKE DOING WHAT WE ARE DOING OUT HERE 
AND THERE ARE FEW THINGS KALI LIKES MORE THAN WINNING THAT'S MIN E. 
I'M BLACK 
NO I'M BLACK NO YOU CAN'T JUST DO THAT BECAUSE THE CAMERA'S ON 
KALI YOU BIG CHEAT 
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU JUST COS I BEAT YOU 
YOU'RE A CHEAT KALI COME ON 
YOU CHEATER KALI DON'T BE SO SILLY 
ABSOLUTE CHEAT 
OLIVER'S LIFE IS ALSO BUILT AROUND ACHIEVING HIS AMBITIONS 
HE'S SCHOOLED AT HOME AND HAS ALREADY PASSED SIX GCSES TWO YEARS EARLY 
GIVING HIM TIME TO CONCENTRATE ON HIS TENNIS 
I'VE BEEN MADE TO GROW UP BEFORE MY TIME YOU CAN ALMOST LOOK AT IT IN A WAY THAT I'M DOING A FULL TIME JOB 
NOT A GREAT DAY REALLY THE BUSES HAVEN'T TURNED UP NOTHING 
IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THEM FUN DAYS 
MOST OF MY DAY IS DEVOTED TO TENNIS 
HIS MUM SANDRA HAS ASSEMBLED A TEAM OF SPECIALISTS TO DEVELOP HIS CAREER 
MY LITTLE TEAM I'VE GOT 
OBVIOUSLY MY FITNESS TRAINER GET A BIT LOWER KEEP YOUR KNEE BENT 
AND I'VE GOT A PHYSIO RAYMOND 
I'VE GOT MY HITTERS THEY BASICALLY ARE JUST BETTER PLAYERS THAN ME 
THAT I CAN PLAY WITH AND IMPROVE MY GAME 
I'VE GOT MY TENNIS COACH OTTO 
HE IS PARTICULARLY TALENTED 
HE DOES TIME THE BALL EXTREMELY WELL 
IT HELPS THAT HE'S INCREDIBLY COMPETITIVE 
BUT OLIVER'S DESIRE TO WIN IS BECOMING A PROBLEM 
CONCENTRATE O. K. ABSOLUTELY CONCENTRATE AND DON'T REACT 
JESUS TAKE YOUR TIME TAKE YOUR TIME 
DON'T RUSH THROUGH IT 
JESUS THAT IS TERRIBLE 
OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU PUT A LOT OF TIME IN AND YOU GO 
ON THE COURT AND YOU PLAY RUBBISH IT'S VERY VERY FRUSTRATING 
SHIT 
OLI SERIOUSLY PLEASE DON'T DO THAT 
OLIVER'S TRAINING FOR A MAJOR TOURNAMENT THAT WILL PIT HIM 
AGAINST SOME OF THE BEST YOUNG PLAYERS IN EUROPE 
WHATEVER HAPPENS YOU'VE GOT TO TRY AND FIND A WAY OF STAYING LEVEL HEADED ABOUT IT 
YOU LOSE POINTS BECAUSE YOU'RE PISSED OFF 
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'VE DONE THAT 
BACK AT RAVENSCOURT THEATRE SCHOOL AND KEEKI'S CABARET REHEARSALS ARE IN FULL SWING 
TOGETHER EVERYONE 
TOGETHER TOGETHER COME ON LET'S HAVE SOME FUN 
SAM'S WORRIED AS WELL WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING GOES RIGHT 
I'M SURE IT WILL GO RIGHT BUT IT WOULD BE ONLY HUMAN NOT TO I MEAN TO WORRY 
THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE TO GET THIS RIGHT 
THE SCHOOL COULD GET EXTRA WORK AND PUBLICITY IF IT GOES WELL 
BUT TENSIONS ARE HIGH 
WHEN KEEKI'S MUM SAM CHANGES SINGERS ON A SONG A FIGHT BREAKS OUT 
GO AWAY KEEKI YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT WHEN OTHER PEOPLE WERE PICKING ON YOU YESTERDAY 
BASICALLY I PICKED SOME BOYS TO DO A SONG 
I WAS GOING TO DO A YOUNGER GIRL WITH THEM 
WHICH WAS ELLIE BUT THEN I THOUGHT LET'S GO WITH THE BOYS 
YOU KNOW GIVE THEM THAT CHANCE THEY'VE GOT UNTIL TOMORROW TO LEARN IT 
AND THEN IT ALL KICKED OFF 
ALL I SAID WAS YOU DIDN'T GET THE PART AND YOU START CRYING AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT 
THIS IS WHAT I SAID TO ELLIE YOU'RE ALL ON YOUR OWN IN THIS BUSINESS AND YOU KNOW THAT 
PEOPLE ARE GONNA SAY THINGS COS PEOPLE ARE JEALOUS OF YOU 
IT'S OVER SOMETHING SILLY 
ELLIE DIDN'T MENTION YOUR NAME ONCE 
SHE DID NOT TO ME SHE DIDN'T COME ON WHEN SHE WENT GO AWAY 
JUST IGNORE DEMI THAT'S SISTERS 
THE CABARET ISN'T THE ONLY THING KEEKI'S REHEARSING 
IT'S HALF SIX NOW AND I'VE BEEN DOING THE CABARET 
I'M ON THE TRAIN NOW TO DO SOME REHEARSALS FOR HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 
I'M FEELING VERY ILL 
AND WE'RE LATE AND WE'RE LATE 
COME ON WE'RE GONNA BE LATE WE'RE ALREADY LATE 
I STILL WENT TO THE CABARET AND HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL BECAUSE I LOVE TO PERFORM EVEN THOUGH I HAD A COLD 
BUT I LOVE TO PERFORM 
SINGING DANCING ACTING PRACTICALLY IS MY LIFE 
YESTERDAY I HAD A REALLY BAD THROAT AND I THINK IT'S MY GLANDS 
NOW I'VE GOT A BAD THROAT AND A BELLY ACHE AND I JUST FEEL REALLY SICK 
A LOT OF THE MEMBERS OF THE CABARET HAVE BEEN ILL TODAY 
I THINK THERE HAVE PROBABLY BEEN 
SEVEN EIGHT 
KEEKI BEING ONE OF THEM 
THE HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL THING LAST NIGHT I SAID TO THEM IF THEY WEREN'T UP TO IT NOT TO GO 
BUT BECAUSE THEY HADN'T SEEN EVERYONE OR PERFORMED IT SINCE NOVEMBER THEY WANTED TO GO 
IT'S ONLY TWO AND A HALF WEEKS AWAY AGAIN TILL WE ACTUALLY PERFORM IT ON STAGE 
I DON'T THINK IT'S BECAUSE I DO TOO MUCH 
IT'S JUST BECAUSE I FELT REALLY ILL 
THEY LIKE TO BE BUSY AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S 
LIKE I SAID BEFORE I DON'T WANT THEM OUT AND ABOUT ON AN ESTATE WITH HIGH TEENAGE PREGNANCIES 
I'VE GOT FIVE GIRLS I DON'T WANT TO BE A GRANDMA YET 
SO I WANT TO KEEP THEM BUSY AT ALL TIMES AND THEY WANT TO BE BUSY 
OLIVER CAN SPEND TWENTY WEEKS A YEAR AWAY FROM HOME PLAYING IN TENNIS TOURNAMENTS 
TODAY I'M LEAVING FOR FRANCE 
MY EUROSTAR GOES IN ABOUT 
THREE HOURS 
UNFORTUNATELY I DO ALL THIS WORK BUT I VERY RARELY GET TO GO 
IT'S A BIT BORING FOR ME REALLY 
THIS BIGGEST DRAG ABOUT MY LIFE IS PROBABLY THAT I DON'T SPEND ENOUGH TIME AT HOME 
I MISS SLEEPING IN MY OWN BED AND BEING ABLE TO DO WHAT PEOPLE WOULD USUALLY TAKE FOR GRANTED 
OLIVER'S TOURNAMENT IN LILLE IS THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS HE'S EVER PLAYED IN 
IT ATTRACTS SOME OF EUROPE'S BEST UNDER SIXTEEN PLAYERS 
I'M NOT REALLY NERVOUS 
IT'LL BE GOOD TO SEE HOW I'M FARING UP WITH THE GUYS ABROAD 
HE'S ALREADY ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS IN THE COUNTRY 
BUT BEING ONE OF THE BEST IN THE U. K. ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
HE HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS IN EUROPE UNDER SIXTEEN TO BE THINKING ABOUT PLAYING TENNIS PROFESSIONALLY 
OLIVER ISN'T EXPECTED TO DO WELL 
HE'S FOURTEEN AND SMALLER THAN MANY OF THE PLAYERS HERE 
THEY'RE ALL A YEAR OLDER THAN ME SO IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY TOUGH 
THERE'S NO WEAK PLAYERS SO IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY 
HIS LACK OF EMOTIONAL CONTROL FLARES UP AGAIN IN PRACTICE 
JUNIOR TENNIS PLAYERS OFTEN FIND IT DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THEIR COMPETITIVE STREAK 
TOO HIGH 
TOO HIGH FOR IT 
ROGER FEDERER WAS THE SAME IN JUNIORS HE WAS EXTREMELY VOLATILE 
OLI'S AT A STAGE WHERE HE HAS TO START CHANNELLING IT FOR IT TO BE REALLY USEFUL FOR HIM 
AS YOU GET OLDER ANY SMALL THING WHETHER IT'S PHYSICAL OR MENTAL 
CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WINNING AND LOSING 
OLIVER'S FIRST GAME IS AGAINST A HIGHLY RATED FRENCH PLAYER 
I THINK HE'S KEEPING HIMSELF IN CHECK REASONABLY WELL BUT THEN HE IS WINNING 
OLI'S MAKING THIS PLAYER LOOK VERY ORDINARY AND HE'S NOT 
A STRAIGHT SETS WIN SEES OLIVER THROUGH TO THE NEXT ROUND 
THIS TIME IT'S HIS OPPONENT STRUGGLING TO ACCEPT DEFEAT 
THIS IS BRILLIANT REALLY HE'S ONE OF THE TOP IN FRANCE 
UNDER SIXTEEN AND I'M ONLY FOURTEEN AND SO TO BEAT HIM IS PRETTY BIG 
NOW COMING UP I'M PLAYING A GUY WITH ABSOLUTELY CRAZY HAIR CALLED KONSTANTINOS MIKOS FROM GREECE 
HE'S THIRTEEN IN EUROPE UNDER SIXTEEN AND HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE PRETTY GOOD BUT I THINK I'VE GOT QUITE A GOOD CHANCE 
O. K. OLI'S JUST BEEN BROKEN AGAIN 
THAT GAME WAS PRETTY IMPORTANT 
HE IS STARTING TO GET UPSET 
WHICH IS NOT HELPING HIS CONCENTRATION AND DECISION MAKING 
EVERYTHING THAT'S CLOSE HE THINKS IS OUT 
AND HE BUILDS UP THIS BARRIER IN HIS HEAD AND IT JUST CAUSES HIM UNNECESSARY PROBLEMS 
YOU MADE HIM FUCKING GO BEFORE ME BECAUSE YOU SPENT SO FUCKING LONG DOING EVERYTHING AROUND HERE 
THAT WAS A BAD CALL 
OLI'S SO USED TO LOSING IT THAT HE ACTUALLY CAN GET IT BACK QUITE QUICKLY 
HELLO HELLO 
HOW DID YOU GET ON I DID IT I BLOODY DID IT 
YOU WON YEAH OH SHIT 
UNBELIEVABLE IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER 
I'M FOURTEEN AND I'VE JUST BEATEN THE NUMBER THIRTEEN IN EUROPE UNDER SIXTEEN WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD 
AND I SAVED TWO MATCH POINTS IN DOING SO IN THE SECOND SET SO I AM BLOODY PLEASED TO BE HONEST WITH YOU 
PUT IT THAT WAY 
THE TOURNAMENT REFEREE HOWEVER ISN'T QUITE SO HAPPY 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BETTER BEHAVIOUR ON COURT 
O. K. 
THE UMPIRE TAKES A DECISION 
NO NO THREE TIMES ON THE SECOND SET 
YOU ARE A GOOD PLAYER 
IF YOU HAVE THIS BEHAVIOUR ON COURT YOU LOSE THE MATCH 
O. K. I WANT YOU TO STOP 
THE POINT HE'S MAKING IS IT DOESN'T MATTER 
WHETHER THEY'RE RIGHT OR WRONG OR WHETHER YOU ARE 
AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE A DECISION AND YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH IT 
WE DON'T WANT HIM TO LOSE HIS PASSION 
WE DON'T WANT HIM KILL IT DEAD 
BUT HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN TO CHANNEL IT AND USE IT IN THE RIGHT WAY 
ELEVEN YEAR OLD KALI'S ALSO LEARNING ABOUT HIS COMPETITIVE STREAK IN HIS QUEST TO BECOME A SKI RACER 
TODAY IS RACE DAY 
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TODAY 
WHAT'S YOUR GAME PLAN 
WHAT DO YOU USUALLY SAY IT'S AGGRESSIVELY 
CONTROLLED AGGRESSION CONTROLLED AGGRESSION 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE FIRED UP 
ABSOLUTELY DEMOLISH EVERYBODY ELSE 
DEMOLISH THE COURSE BUT BE TOTALLY IN CONTROL WITH YOURSELF O. K. O. K. 
DON'T KNOW WHETHER YEAH I HOPE TO DO FIRST 
GOT TO BE POSITIVE MATE YOU'VE GOT TO WANT IT I KNOW I HOPE TO BE FIRST 
AND I HOPE TO BE FIRST GOOD BE FIRST 
YOU KNOW HAVE THAT POSITIVE ATTITUDE THAT YOU ARE COMING FIRST 
THERE WE GO YOUNG MAN THANK YOU OLD MAN 
I'M VERY COMPETITIVE IT'S A CLUB RACE AND IT'S IMPORTANT STILL 
THEY'RE REALLY TREATING IT LIKE A FULL ON RACE 
WHICH IS GREAT FOR THE KIDS BECAUSE IT MEANS THEY REALLY GET THE RACE ENVIRONMENT IN THEIR MINDS 
ONE TWO AND DEPART 
DEPART ALLEZ OLIVIER DEPART 
I THINK KALI HAS A GOOD CHANCE 
SOME GUYS ARE ONE OR TWO YEARS OLDER WE'LL SEE 
I THINK HE HAS A GOOD CHANCE TO FINISH IN THE TOP THREE 
IT'S HARD BECAUSE I'M WITH PEOPLE THAT 
ARE OUT HERE ALL THE TIME BUT 
I'VE GOT A GOOD FEELING ABOUT TODAY 
THREE TWO ONE GO 
GO KALI 
I DIDN'T SEE WHAT HAPPENED BUT HE BLEW OUT 
HE'S GOT TO LEARN HE'S GOT TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL HIMSELF 
GOING BONKERS HITTING THE GATES ISN'T GOING TO MAKE YOU GO QUICKER 
TROIS DEUX UN DEPART ALLEZ HUP 
KALI HAS A SECOND RUN TO TRY AND IMPROVE HIS POSITION 
I FELT I DID MUCH BETTER ON THE SECOND ONE THAN THE FIRST ONE 
THAT ONE I DIDN'T DO VERY WELL AT ALL 
I FELT I WAS EARLY ON MOST GATES SO I FELT I DID WELL 
A LA DEUXIEME PLACE FORTY SIX SIXTY TWO EDUARDO 
HIS SECOND RUN NEARLY EARNS HIM A PLACE ON THE WINNERS' PODIUM 
OH YEAH I GOT FOURTH 
NO I CAME FOURTH YOU GOT FIFTH I GOT FOURTH HONESTLY I GOT FOURTH HONESTLY 
LUDOVIC YOU ARE FOURTH AND KALI YOU'RE FIFTH 
YES I DID BEAT YOU 
IT'S YOUR THIRD SEASON THOUGH 
NO SECOND 
I THINK HE WAS TOO MUCH FOCUSED ABOUT THE RESULT HE WANTED TO BEAT THE GUYS 
YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT LONGER HE CAN DO IT MUCH BETTER 
IF HE CHANGE A LITTLE BIT IN THE MIND 
HE THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT THE OTHER GUY 
HE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HIM AND HIS JOB 
FIFTH PLACE IS O. K. 
I WISH I DID BETTER BUT I'M HAPPY 
KALI HAS SOMETHING TO SMILE ABOUT THOUGH 
HIS MUM AND SISTER ARE HERE FOR A VISIT 
HELLO 
WE DECIDED TO SHARE YOU 
LOVE YOU DAD 
LOVE YOU TOO LOVE YOU MUM LOVE YOU TOO 
HAVE A LOOK TO SEE WHAT'S IN THERE THAT I MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE WANTED 
DO YOU WANT TO GET ALL YOUR STUFF OUT 
COAT 
OH 
ANOTHER CAT SUIT 
I'M GOING TO GO RUNNING IN THIS 
I BET HE SLEEPS IN IT TONIGHT 
I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT AND THE PHILIPPE ROUX JACKET 
I'M PROUD OF YOU 
IT'S DAY THREE OF OLIVER'S TENNIS TOURNAMENT 
HE'S THROUGH TO THE LAST SIXTEEN BUT WILL GET DISQUALIFIED IF HE MISBEHAVES ON COURT AGAIN 
UNFORTUNATELY HE'S GOT THE SAME MATCH UMPIRE HE SCREAMED AT IN HIS LAST GAME 
WELL WHENEVER I GO ON THE COURT I DON'T OBVIOUSLY TRY AND GET ANGRY 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I TRY AND DO 
I THOUGHT THERE WERE QUITE A FEW BIG DECISIONS THAT REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE AGAINST ME AND THEY DID 
TO ADD TO THE PRESSURE THE TOURNAMENT REFEREE HAS TURNED UP TO KEEP AN EYE ON OLIVER 
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DONE THAT TWICE ON TWO BREAK POINTS 
I HAD THE PISS EASIEST PASSES AND HIT THEM STRAIGHT TO HIM 
HE THINKS THAT PLAYING BADLY IS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT MAGICALLY 
HAPPENS WHEREAS ACTUALLY HE'S CONTROLLING HOW HE PLAYS 
OH MY GOD 
DID YOU HONESTLY NOT SEE THAT 
I SEE O. K. 
AAAAARH 
OLIVER LOSES IN STRAIGHT SETS 
HOW SHIT CAN YOU POSSIBLY PLAY IN A MATCH 
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN THAT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY TEN 
HE LOST THE MATCH TODAY 
A GOOD DEAL OF IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS AFFECTED BY HIS EMOTIONS 
LIKE ANYTHING ELSE LIKE A BACKHAND HAS TO BE WORKED ON WE HAVE TO WORK ON IT 
ON AVERAGE BRITISH PARENTS SPEND OVER SEVEN HUNDRED A YEAR ON THEIR CHILDREN'S HOBBIES 
BUT THOSE RAISING FUTURE STARS FIND IT A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE 
HELPING KEEKI FULFIL HER PERFORMING AMBITIONS ISN'T CHEAP 
ON TOP OF HER SCHOOL FEES WHICH ARE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED A TERM HER EXTRA PRIVATE CLASSES COST MONEY TOO 
DON'T RELY ON THE SHOE THE SHOE IS THERE TO HELP YOU NOT TO MAKE YOU O. K. 
WE'RE NOT RICH PEOPLE WE DON'T HAVE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO BE RICH 
IT'S LIKE MY MUM AND MY DAD AND MY NAN PAY ABOUT TWO THOUSAND ON EXTRA CURRICULUM DANCING FEES A YEAR 
MY DAD I LOVE MY DADDY BUT I BARELY EVER SEE HIM BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS AT WORK 
EVEN WITH KEEKI'S DAD WORKING ALL HOURS THERE ISN'T ENOUGH FOR THE SCHOOL FEES I LIVE IN THE RED 
I LIVE IN THE RED 
I STILL OWE BILLS FROM LAST TERM I'M STILL PAYING BUT THE TEACHERS KNOW THEY'RE GONNA GET THEIR MONEY 
IT JUST COMES IN DRIBS AND DRABS WITH ME 
WE'VE GOT A SPONSORSHIP WITH THE SCHOOL WHICH MEANS WE DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE FULL FEES 
WE PAY A SET AMOUNT WITH THE SCHOOL AND ANYTHING THE CHILDREN EARN GOES 
TO THE SCHOOL UNLESS THEY GET SOMETHING REALLY BIG THEN THE SCHOOL WILL GIVE SOME OF THAT BACK 
KEEKI'S SCHOOL HAS A THEATRICAL AGENCY WHICH HAS EXCLUSIVE CONTRACTS WITH ALL THEIR STUDENTS 
THE AGENCY THEY'RE LIKE 
A GROUP OF PEOPLE AND THEY FIND JOBS AND THINGS FOR US AND PEOPLE RING 
AND THINGS AND WE GET SENT OFF TO AUDITIONS THROUGH THE AGENCY 
HERE WE HAVE SIGOURNI HERE WE HAVE MEEMI HERE WE HAVE KEEKI 
SHE'S DOING VERY WELL SHE'S LOVELY EXCELLENT 
SHE'S A LOVELY LITTLE ACTRESS NICE LITTLE DANCER 
SAYING THAT THE CHILDREN DO WORK A LOT 
MOST OF THEM GO OUT EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS I WOULD SAY 
WE'RE DOING HARRY POTTER NOW IT INVOLVES CHILDREN GOING OUT FILMING 
THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN LICENSED TO DO PERFORMANCE WORK HAS RISEN EIGHTY PER CENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE 
TODAY KEEKI'S ON A SHOOT FOR GIRL TALK A TEEN MAGAZINE 
YOU KEEP LOSING THINGS THAT'S YOUR THING ON THIS STORY 
FOR HALF A DAY'S WORK THE SCHOOL WILL EARN AROUND FORTY WHICH WILL GO TO KEEKI'S FEES 
THE MAGAZINE IS ONE OF HER REGULAR CONTRACTS 
THAT'S PERFECT 
I LIKE WORKING BECAUSE IT GETS ME MORE EXPERIENCE 
AND IT'S BETTER FOR MY FUTURE 
TO KEEP OLIVER PLAYING TENNIS COSTS OVER TWELVE THOUSAND A YEAR 
IT'S GOT TOUGH FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS AND THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE SPENDING THIS SORT OF MONEY 
FOR REALLY ONLY A FEW PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE THE MONEY 
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO ACTUALLY START MAKING BACK ANY OF THE MONEY SPENT TO GET TO THIS POINT 
UNTIL I'M TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT SORT OF AGE 
EVEN THEN I HAVE TO BE LITERALLY TOP FIFTY IN THE WORLD TO BE MAKING BACK THE MONEY 
SANDRA'S A SINGLE MUM AND SPENDS EVERY SPARE PENNY ON OLIVER'S CAREER 
IT IS A VERY EXPENSIVE BUSINESS 
BY THE TIME YOU'VE GOT TO THE TOURNAMENT PAID FOR THE HOTEL 
PAID FOR THE FOOD PAID FOR THE TRAVEL YOU'RE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOWN 
EVERY SINGLE WEEKEND BECAUSE THERE'S A TOURNAMENT EVERY WEEKEND 
AND THAT'S WITHOUT EVEN GOING ABROAD 
I ALMOST WHEN HE SAYS HE'S WON MY HEART ALMOST SINKS BECAUSE I THINK WHAT AM I GOING TO DO NEXT 
THAT'S ANOTHER LOAD OF MONEY 
OLIVER'S FRIEND HARRY IS OVER FOR DINNER AND SANDRA HAS SOME NEWS 
WAIT FOR IT BIG NEWS 
YOU ARE IN THE MASTERS YES 
I'M HAPPY I'M FEELING GLAD 
I'VE GOT SUNSHINE IN MY HAND 
WHAT'S SO GOOD ABOUT IT IS THE FACT THAT TO GET TO THE MASTERS 
ONLY WILL COST YOU A BIKE RIDE 
YOU ONLY HAVE TO GO ROUND THE CORNER WHICH IS A BIG BREAKTHROUGH 
MY DREAM IS TO FLY 
OVER THE RAINBOW SO HIGH 
THE MASTERS TOURNAMENT IS RESERVED FOR BRITAIN'S BEST TENNIS PLAYERS 
IT'S RUN BY THE BRITISH LAWN TENNIS ASSOCIATION WHO HELP DEVELOP U. K. TALENT 
OLIVER'S CAREER NOW HANGS ON HIS ABILITY TO ATTRACT MORE SPONSORSHIP MONEY 
OLIVER GETS TWO INSTALMENTS OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FOR THE YEAR 
WHICH JUST GOES NO WAY TO COVERING IT 
I WORK SEVEN DAYS A WEEK TO SUBSIDISE IT AND IT'S QUITE HARD GOING 
IF HE PLAYS WELL THEY MIGHT GIVE US A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY 
AND WE NEED MONEY AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE MONEY IS HOLDING HIM BACK 
KALI'S SKI SEASON AND GARY'S LOST INCOME COST OVER FORTY THOUSAND 
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT KALI WILL HAVE TO DO YEAR AFTER YEAR 
OBVIOUSLY IT'S AN EXPENSIVE THING THAT WE'VE TAKEN ON 
THIS KIND OF TRAINING IN THIS ENVIRONMENT 
AND ME NOT WORKING FOR THREE OR FOUR MONTHS BECOMES AN EXPENSIVE BUSINESS 
WE'RE HOPING THAT WITH KALI IMPROVING ALL THE TIME 
THAT HE WILL FIND SPONSORS SO THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY TAKE SOME OF THE BURDEN AWAY FROM US 
UNTIL THEN KALI'S PARENTS WILL HAVE BEAR THE COST 
GO ON THEN GET ON WITH YOUR PRESS UPS 
COME ON LET'S SEE THE EFFORT IN THEM 
I BELIEVE THAT THE ROLE OF A PARENT IS TO FACILITATE YOUR CHILDREN TO LIVE THEIR DREAMS 
AND SO THE FACT THAT IF KALI WANTS TO BE A SKI RACER 
I KNOW THAT HE HAS TO TRAIN FROM A YOUNG AGE SO THERE IS NO PERSUASION 
IF THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO THEN I'LL FULLY FULLY SUPPORT HIM 
VERY OFTEN I WILL GET ASKED ISN'T THIS ALL ABOUT GARY LIVING OUT HIS DREAM THROUGH KALI 
ISN'T THAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE'S GETTING FORCED OR PRESSURED INTO 
LIVING GARY'S DREAMS COS GARY WOULD HAVE LOVED TO BE A SKI RACER 
AND I THINK REALLY NO IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH GARY 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY KALI'S DREAM IN FACT YOU ONLY HAVE TO TURN ROUND AND LOOK BEHIND YOU 
IT'S KALI'S PASSION 
ISN'T IT MATE MM HMM 
IT WAS HOT TODAY 
WE DID A LOT OF SITTING AROUND AS WELL DIDN'T WE 
IT'S NOT JUST MY DAD THAT MAKES ME WANT TO BECOME A SKIER 
IT'S ALSO MYSELF BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO LIKE THE THINGS I LIKE 
I DO FEEL PRESSURE FOR ME DOING WELL COS OF THE TIME DAD HAS TAKEN OUT 
HE'S SACRIFICED A LOT 
I DON'T KNOW HOW MY PARENTS WOULD REACT IF 
IF I DON'T BECOME A SKIER 
ALL THIS LISTENING TO YOU RAISES QUESTIONS IN MY HEAD ABOUT YOUR ANSWERS 
EVEN THOUGH I'VE TOLD YOU SO MANY TIMES YOU DON'T KNOW HOW 
WHAT MY REACTION WOULD BE IF YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT 
I KNOW YOU DO SAY THAT BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S TRUE 
YOU MIGHT THINK IT INSIDE BUT NOT SHOW IT ON THE OUTSIDE 
WE CAN KEEP DOING THIS FOR AS LONG AS YOU'RE HAPPY 
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE YOU'VE CHOSEN TO BE HERE 
ALL I'M DOING IS ACTING AS A SPRINGBOARD TO TAKE YOU WHERE YOU'VE SAID YOU WANT TO BE 
ZERO PRESSURE ON YOU 
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT YOU TELL ME WE PACK UP WE GO HOME YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO 
O. K. O. K. 
I KNOW FROM MY CHILDHOOD ABOUT PEOPLE SAYING NO 
BECAUSE MY MUM AND DAD NEVER HAD THE MONEY O. K. 
SO FOR ME YOU'LL ALWAYS KNOW 
AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WITH YOU 
YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE MATE O. K. 
LOVE YOU MATE 
LOVE YOU TOO 
IT'S A BIG DAY FOR KEEKI 
TONIGHT SHE'S APPEARING IN THE CABARET SHE AND HER SISTERS HAVE BEEN WORKING SO HARD TO PREPARE FOR 
IT'S BEEN QUITE TIRING DOING REHEARSALS ALL WEEK 
BUT WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE EARLY SO WE CAN HAVE A PRACTICE FIRST 
I DON'T REALLY GET NERVOUS BUT WHAT GOES THROUGH MY MIND IS THE STEPS 
A SLIGHT TECHNICAL PROBLEM BEFORE THE SHOW HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE SERIOUS PROBLEMS 
BETWEEN KEEKI AND HER SISTER SIGOURNI 
THERE'S ONLY TWO MICS AND WE NEED THREE 
AND NOW SIGOURNI'S COMING AT ME STARTING AN ARGUMENT 
APPARENTLY SHE NEEDS A MIC WHEN SHE BARELY SINGS SO 
YEAH BUT THAT'S UNFAIR WHY CAN'T ADAM BRING HIS OWN P. A. SYSTEM AND MICS 
SHE'S TELLING ME I DON'T NEED A MIC WHEN I SING MORE THAN HER I DIDN'T SAY THAT YES YOU DID 
YOU SAID I DON'T NEED A MIC WHEN WE HAVE TO SING LOUDER THAN THE MUSIC 
THIS IS AN EXTRA SPECIAL NIGHT FOR KEEKI 
IN THE CABARET CHARLIE BROOKS IS GOING TO BE THERE 
I'M REALLY EXCITED BECAUSE SHE'S ONE OF MY IDOLS AND I HOPE SHE LIKES ALL OF OUR PERFORMANCE 
MY NAME IS CHARLIE BROOKS 
SOME OF YOU MIGHT KNOW ME AS JANINE FROM EASTENDERS 
I'M HERE TO PRESENT TO YOU TONIGHT RAVENSCOURT THEATRE SCHOOL 
WHO ARE GOING TO BE DOING SOME DANCE ROUTINES FOR YOU ALL 
HEY MAMA HEY MAMA LOOK AROUND 
EVERYBODY'S MOVING TO THE BRAND NEW SOUND 
HEY MAMA HEY MAMA FOLLOW ME 
I KNOW SOMETHING PARTICULAR THAT YOU WANNA SET FREE 
SO LET GO GO GO COME NOW 
SING ALONG TO THE LIGHT IN YOUR EYES 
I'M HOT SWEATY SMELLY AND I NEED A DRINK 
I THINK IT WAS REALLY REALLY GOOD 
OUR PERFORMANCE WAS REALLY GOOD TODAY 
DID YOU ENJOY IT YEAH 
I SAW YOU I THOUGHT YOU WERE FANTASTIC THANK YOU 
CHARLIE BROOKS WAS SAYING TO ME HOW GOOD I WAS AND I WAS SMILING A LOT AND IT MAKES ME FEEL REALLY HAPPY 
BECAUSE IT'S NICE TO GET LIKE TOLD THAT BY ONE OF MY IDOLS 
KEEKI NEIL WANTS TO SEE YOU 
SEE LOOK SHE'S GOT A FAN BASE ALREADY THEY'RE ALL SCREAMING TO SEE KEEKI KEEKI 
A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE 
OLIVER'S IN FRANCE ALSO ENJOYING SUCCESS 
IT'S ANOTHER BIG TOURNAMENT AND HE'S IN THE SEMI FINALS 
THEY'VE GOT YOU A YEAR OLDER THAN YOU ACTUALLY ARE 
THEY'VE SPELT MY NAME WRONG LEFT THE G. OFF THE END 
IT'S QUITE FUNNY TO SEE MYSELF IN THE PAPER 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU SEE EVERY DAY IS IT 
I DON'T OPEN UP THE DAILY MAIL OH HELLO THERE I AM AGAIN 
HIS COACH OTTO HAS BEEN WORKING WITH HIM OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS 
TO TRY AND HELP HIM CONTROL HIS ON COURT BEHAVIOUR 
EMOTIONALLY IT'S BEEN BETTER I HAVEN'T SNAPPED AS MUCH 
I'VE ONLY BROKEN SIX RACQUETS I WAS FANTASTIC I WAS MENTALLY GREAT 
THE GUY I BEAT YESTERDAY HAD A SIMILAR RANKING TO THE GUY THAT I'M PLAYING TODAY 
SO IT SHOULD BE A SIMILAR MATCH 
IT'S A BIG MOMENT IN OLIVER'S CAREER 
WINNING HERE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY RAISE HIS PROFILE 
YOU CAN SEE FROM THERE THAT IT'S ABOUT THIS FAR OUT 
IT WAS SO FAR OUT 
IT'S JUST A BAD DAY AT THE OFFICE I THINK 
OLIVER'S BEHAVIOUR RAISES CONCERNS TOMORROW HE'S PLAYING IN THE U. K. MASTERS 
AN EVENT THAT COULD HELP HIM WIN EXTRA FUNDING TO DEVELOP HIS CAREER 
BYE BYE MERCI AU REVOIR 
AT ROEHAMPTON IF HE LOSES IT COMPLETELY AND SNAPS 
THEN THEY WON'T HELP HIM LTA WON'T HELP HIM 
THE MASTERS TOURNAMENT IS HELD AT THE LAWN TENNIS ASSOCIATION HEADQUARTERS IN ROEHAMPTON 
THIS IS THE HEART OF THE BRITISH TENNIS ESTABLISHMENT 
THE GREAT AND THE GOOD OF THE GAME ARE HERE TO SEE THE BEST UNDER SIXTEENS DO BATTLE 
EVEN OLIVER'S MUM HAS MANAGED TO MAKE IT 
IT'S IMPORTANT I'M PLAYING THE NUMBER ONE IN MY AGE GROUP IN THE COUNTRY 
AND I'M TWO OR THREE IN THE COUNTRY SO IT'S A BIG MATCH 
THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE TO PERFORM 
IF I'M NOT LOOKING VERY GOOD THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE ME AS MUCH SUPPORT 
HE'S NERVOUS HE'S PUTTING A LOT ON THIS MATCH IT'S A BIT OF A PRESSURE COOKER ENVIRONMENT 
ADDING TO THE PRESSURE PAUL ANNACONE WHO USED TO TRAIN PETE SAMPRAS 
AND IS NOW AN LTA COACH HAS COME TO WATCH 
DESPITE THE PRESSURE OLIVER STAYS IN CONTROL 
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A CERTAIN BALANCE BETWEEN PASSION AND NOT LETTING IT BOIL OVER 
KNOWING WHEN TO NOT SHOUT AND SCREAM AND DING YOUR RACQUET 
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A PASSION BUT YOU'VE GOT TO CONTROL IT 
YOU CAN'T LET IT FLY ALL OVER THE PLACE 
HE ALSO PLAYS WELL 
SO SHIT 
I'M SO SURPRISED IN THE DIFFERENCE IN HIM AGAINST HIM I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS 
THIS IS A NICE SURPRISE 
ALL THE WORK THAT I'VE BEEN DOING HAS REALLY PAID OFF 
JUST IN THE FIVE MINUTES THAT I'M LOOKING AT THIS MATCH 
I FEEL REALLY POSITIVE 
OLI'S GOT SOME VERY GOOD TALENT 
HE'S DONE WELL HE SEEM TO HIT THE BALL EXTREMELY WELL HE'S GOT SOME VERY GOOD WEAPONS WHICH YOU NEED 
TIME WILL TELL BUT HE'S GOT A GOOD FOUNDATION TO BUILD FROM 
OLIVER DIDN'T WIN THE COMPETITION BUT HE'S IMPRESSED THE RIGHT PEOPLE 
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF POINTS HERE AND THERE THAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM WINNING AND ME WINNING 
IT WAS CLOSE I GAVE IT MY BEST SHOT SO I CAN'T ASK FOR ANYTHING MORE 
BUT FOR OLIVER THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO 
STATISTICALLY SPEAKING 
PLAYING TENNIS HE'S ALMOST GUARANTEED TO FAIL 
BUT IN MANY WAYS THAT'S NOT THE POINT 
THE FACT THAT HE'S DOING IT AT ALL IS A FANTASTIC THING FOR HIM 
THE WORST THING IN THE WORLD IS REGRET 
TO BE GOOD ENOUGH TO DO SOMETHING AND NOT TO HAVE TRIED IS A WORSE CRIME THAN TO DO IT AND FAIL 
I DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT FAILURE REALLY 
I JUST FOCUS ON WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO TO WIN 
I DON'T THINK ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I DON'T WIN UNTIL I'VE LOST 
IF I COULDN'T PLAY TENNIS AT ALL 
I'D OBVIOUSLY BE A TENNIS COACH IF I WASN'T A TENNIS PLAYER 
IF COULDN'T PLAY TENNIS AT ALL 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I WANT TO THINK ABOUT ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT YET 
WHAT WOULD I BE 
DUSTMAN PROBABLY 
THERE'LL BE MANY OPENING NIGHTS ON KEEKI'S THE ROAD TO FAME 
I WOULDN'T MIND IF I DIDN'T BECOME FAMOUS BECAUSE I COULD BE A DANCE TEACHER 
OR DO YOU KNOW THE JOB THAT THEY DO ON SHIPS WHERE THEY SING 
BIG SHIPS LIKE TITANIC 
I'D DO ONE OF THEM I'D AUDITION FOR IT 
I DEFINITELY WOULDN'T GO AND BE A BANKER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST BORING AND I'D CRY 
AND AS FOR KALI 
THERE AREN'T ANY OTHER THINGS I'D LIKE TO BE WHEN I GROW UP 
THIS IS THE ONLY THING I'D LIKE TO DO 
THIS IS THE ONLY THING I'M CONCENTRATING ON 
THIS AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING EXPERIENCE FOR KALI REGARDLESS OF WHERE IT LEADS TO IN HIS LIFE 
ALL RIGHT YEAH 
NOT ONLY FOR WHAT HE IS LEARNING ABOUT THE SKIING 
BUT THE WAY HE'S LIVING AND THE RELATIONSHIP HE'S DEVELOPED WITH HIS DAD 
THIS HAS GIVEN THE TWO OF THEM SUCH AN AMAZING BONDING OPPORTUNITY 
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT NOT HAVE WITH THEIR DADS 
WE'RE TOGETHER A LOT 
ESPECIALLY NOW 
SO HE'S BECOMING A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE 
OH IS THAT THE PRETEND LIMP 
OOH I'VE GOT ONE OF THOSE AS WELL 
THIS IS TEN PER CENT LUCK TWENTY PER CENT SKILL 
FIFTEEN PER CENT CONCENTRATED POWER OF WILL 
FIVE PER CENT PLEASURE FIFTY PER CENT PAIN 
AND ONE HUNDRED PER CENT REASON TO REMEMBER THE NAME
