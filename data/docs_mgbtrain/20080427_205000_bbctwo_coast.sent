OUR JOURNEY STARTS HERE AT THE BUSY FERRY PORT OF HOLYHEAD 
POINT OF EMBARKATION AND DEPARTURE FOR OVER TWO MILLION PASSENGERS A YEAR CROSSING TO AND FROM IRELAND 
BUT OUR OWN JOURNEY IS GOING TO TAKE A VERY DIFFERENT ROUTE 
ROUND THE EAST COAST OF ANGLESEY 
ACROSS NORTH WALES TO THE WIRRAL AND FINALLY TO LIVERPOOL 
THE JOURNEY ALONG THIS COAST IS ONE THAT'S FULL OF PROMISE 
AND THAT SAME JOURNEY BY SEA IS NO DIFFERENT 
FOR CENTURIES IT WAS LIKE 
THE M. FOUR FOR COMMERCIAL SHIPPING 
FOR A SHIP'S CAPTAIN PUTTING IN AT HOLYHEAD ON A RETURN VOYAGE 
MEANT ONE THING NEXT STOP LIVERPOOL 
AND THAT MEANT HOME AND PROFIT 
NOW IT'S A HECK OF A LONG WAY 
BUT IF A SHIP'S OWNER SITTING AT LIVERPOOL COULD GET AN INSTANT MESSAGE 
THAT HIS SHIP AND ITS PRECIOUS CARGO HAD TURNED UP SAFE AND WELL AT HOLYHEAD 
THEN IMAGINE THE ADVANTAGE THAT WOULD GIVE HIM WHEN IT CAME TO PLAYING THE MARKET 
IT WOULD ALSO PUT HIM AHEAD OF THE GAME WHEN IT CAME TO MAKING PROVISION FOR THE NEXT VOYAGE 
BECAUSE IN THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS TIME THEN AS NOW WAS MONEY 
AND SOMEHOW SHIPPING COMPANY MESSAGES 
WERE BEING SENT FROM HOLYHEAD TO LIVERPOOL IN MERE MINUTES 
I'M ON MY WAY TO MEET A RETIRED PHYSICS TEACHER 
NAME OF FRANK LARGE OVER AT POINT LYNAS LIGHTHOUSE AND APPARENTLY 
FRANK'S MADE A LIFE STUDY OF WHAT HE CALLS THE HOLYHEAD TO LIVERPOOL OPTICAL TELEGRAPH 
WHAT ON EARTH IS AN OPTICAL TELEGRAPH 
WELL OPTICAL TELEGRAPH IS ONE IN WHICH YOU CAN SEE THE SIGNAL FROM ONE STATION TO THE NEXT 
IT'S VISUAL SO YOU'VE GOT TWO MASTS 
AND ONE MAST PUTS THROUGH A SIGNAL AND THE OTHER ONE THEN SEES IT 
AND THEY RELAY IT FROM ONE TO THE NEXT 
THIS IS THE LONGEST STAGE 
THIS IS THE HARDEST BIT TO DO THE TWELVE MILES FROM 
THERE'S THAT STATION UP THERE ON THE HILL WITH THE BAY WINDOW 
OH YES THAT ONE RELAYED ACROSS TO PUFFIN ISLAND JUST THERE 
THE STATION IS ON THE LEFT HAND END AND THEN THE NEXT ONE IS AT THE TOP 
OF THE GREAT ORME WHICH IS ACROSS THERE 
SO HOW MANY STATIONS IN THE TELEGRAPH THERE WAS ABOUT ELEVEN 
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS BETWEEN SIX AND TWELVE MILES 
HOW QUICKLY COULD YOU COMMUNICATE ONE END TO THE OTHER 
WE'VE GOT VARIOUS REPORTS WE'VE GOT ONE REPORT WHICH SAYS TWENTY SEVEN SECONDS 
THERE'S A VERY WELL DOCUMENTED CASE THAT SOMEBODY IN LIVERPOOL ASKED A QUESTION OF HOLYHEAD 
AND THEY GOT THE MESSAGE BACK IN THREE MINUTES 
BUT THE ROUTINE MESSAGES PROBABLY TEN TO TWELVE MINUTES 
THAT WAS BRILLIANT IN THOSE DAYS WHAT DOES A MESSAGE LOOK LIKE 
IT'S CODED YOU HAVE A NUMBER AND THE NUMBER CORRESPONDS TO A MESSAGE 
NOW THE ACTUAL NUMBERS WERE SENT BY THE ARMS OF THE TELEGRAPH 
ANY CHANCE OF SEEING ONE OF THESE MAGNIFICENT STRUCTURES 
THE REAL ONES HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY 
BUT WE DO HAVE A SMALL SCALE MODEL OVER HERE 
SO LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT THAT 
WELL NEIL THIS IS OUR REPLICA TELEGRAPH 
IT'S ABOUT A THIRD OF THE SIZE 
TO HELP US CONDUCT AN EXPERIMENT TO SEE HOW EFFECTIVE THE OPTICAL TELEGRAPH WAS 
AND HOW FAST I'VE ENLISTED THE SUPPORT OF SOME FINE YOUNG MEMBERS OF THE HOLYHEAD SEA CADETS' 
SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS TRY AND SEND A SIGNAL FROM HERE DOWN TO A DISTANT STATION 
FOUR OF YOU ARE COMING WITH ME 
WE'LL LEAVE YOU TO SEND THE MESSAGE GOOD LUCK WE'LL PICK IT UP ON THE OTHER SIDE 
DIFFERENT POSITIONS OF THE TELEGRAPH'S ARMS WILL REPRESENT DIFFERENT NUMBERS 
AND WE CAN TRANSLATE THESE NUMBERS INTO A MESSAGE IN THE TELEGRAPHER'S CODE BOOK 
SO ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY ONE MEANS SUNK DURING THE NIGHT 
SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO HAVE YOU ANY SICK ON BOARD 
TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY SHE'S A COMPLETE WRECK 
THERE'S EVEN ONE FOR PAST APPRENTICES 
THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO YOU'RE FIRED 
HERE'S THE MESSAGE THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEND RIGHT 
ONE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED TEN AND FORTY 
O. K. NUMBER ONE DO YOUR JOB 
THAT'S IT 
ONE HUNDRED CAN YOU INDICATE 
YEAH GOT IT 
FOUR HUNDRED 
TEN 
AND FORTY 
EXCELLENT 
O. K. THAT'S THE MESSAGE COMPLETE 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT WIND AT PT LYNAS SOUTH SOUTHWEST MODERATE BREEZE 
NOTHING NOTHING MORE TO REPORT 
LOVELY THAT'S THE WHOLE MESSAGE CAN YOU SEND THAT BACK THAT WAS QUICK 
I THINK I'LL BE OPTIMISTIC AND GET MY PHONE READY 
THERE IT IS THAT'S OUR FOUR NUMBERS 
WE'VE JUST SENT FOUR COMPLEX MESSAGES IN TWENTY FOUR SECONDS 
IF ALL THE TELEGRAPHERS FROM HOLYHEAD TO LIVERPOOL WERE ON STANDBY 
AND VISIBILITY ALLOWED THEM TO SKIP SOME STATIONS 
TWENTY SEVEN SECONDS TO SEND ONE MESSAGE DOES SEEM A VERY REAL POSSIBILITY 
I'M DETERMINED TO SEE IF MODERN TECHNOLOGY CAN HOLD A CANDLE 
TO THE SPEED OF THE OPTICAL TELEGRAPH 
ACROSS THE MERSEY TO LIVERPOOL THE LIVER BUILDING AND THE END OF OUR TELEGRAPH ROAD 
IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING I'VE BEEN ITCHING TO HAVE A GO AT 
WELCOME TO THE ROYAL LIVER BUILDING CHALLENGE I'VE GOT FRANK WITH ME 
AND WE'VE GOT A FANTASTIC PLAN 
WE'RE GOING TO USE MODERN TECHNOLOGY TO TRY AND BEAT THE UNOFFICIAL RECORD 
SET BY THE HOLYHEAD TO LIVERPOOL OPTICAL TELEGRAPH OF TWENTY SEVEN SECONDS 
NOW I KNOW I KNOW WE COULD SIMPLY USE A MOBILE PHONE AND SEND A TEXT HUNDREDS OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF MILES 
BUT THAT WOULD BE NO CHALLENGE 
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS ARRANGE EIGHT VOLUNTEERS AT SET LOCATIONS BETWEEN HERE AND HOLYHEAD 
A FOUR FIGURE CODED MESSAGE IS GOING TO BE SENT 
FROM ONE LOCATION TO THE NEXT UNTIL IT REACHES US HERE IN LIVERPOOL 
AND REMEMBER THE TARGET TO BEAT IS TWENTY SEVEN SECONDS 
I'LL GET MY MAN OWAIN ON THE BLOWER AND I'LL TIME IT 
GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD RIGHT GO AHEAD 
HELLO OWAIN HELLO 
ARE YOU GUYS READY IN HOLYHEAD 
YES WE ARE READY HERE I'M GOING TO COUNT YOU DOWN FROM FIVE 
FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE 
SEND YOUR MESSAGE 
MESSAGE LEFT HOLYHEAD 
O. K. CLOCK'S RUNNING WE'RE AWAY FIVE SECONDS ALREADY 
HOW LONG TO THE RECORD 
THE RECORD IS COMING UP TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR 
IT'S SLIPPING AWAY FROM US TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN 
THAT'S TWENTY SEVEN SECONDS 
OH MY HOPES WERE SO HIGH WELL YES 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT TELL US 
I WROTE A FEW DOWN THESE ARE JUST ONE LINERS 
SO IT COULD BE I HAVE A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE ON BOARD 
THAT'S A MINUTE IS THAT A MINUTE 
I HAVE LOST MY RUDDER THAT'S SERIOUS 
ONE OF THE BEST ONES I THINK WAS THE ONE THAT SAID WHAT BOOK OF CODES HAVE YOU 
SO UNLESS YOU'VE GOT THIS BOOK OF CODES YOU CAN'T DECODE IT 
TO FIND THE QUESTION WAS WHAT BOOK OF CODES HAVE YOU GOT 
OOH HERE IT IS HANG ON 
SO MUCH FOR MODERN TECHNOLOGY THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY 
WORK PHONE WORK PHONE QUICK 
THIS IS TWO MINUTES COMING UP NOW RIGHT OH 
I'VE GOT THINGS I COULD BE DOING I KNOW 
YOU DON'T HAVE A PACK OF CARDS DO YOU 
UM NO I SPY 
IT'S COMING UP TO TWO MINUTES THIRTY 
WERE SHIPS PLYING UP AND DOWN THAT WATERWAY ABLE TO GET INVOLVED WITH THESE MESSAGES 
YOU COULD SEND A MESSAGE TO AN INDIVIDUAL CAPTAIN 
YOU'D SIMPLY SEND A MESSAGE FROM HERE SAYING TELL CAPTAIN WHATEVER OF SUCH AND SUCH A SHIP 
THEN IT WOULD GO ALONG THE LINE AND THE MESSAGE WOULD GO TO THE SHIP AND THE SHIP COULD SEND A MESSAGE BACK 
WELL WE'RE COMING UP TO AROUND ABOUT THE FOUR MINUTES 
WHAT DO WE LOOK LIKE STOOD ON THE ROOF OF THE LIVER BUILDING 
I KNOW 
RIGHT 
STAND BY EVERYONE MESSAGE RECEIVED 
TIME FOUR MINUTES TEN SECONDS 
MESSAGE IS ONE NINE ZERO TO FOUR ONE NINE ZERO TO FOUR 
REFER TO THE CODEBOOK PLEASE THE CODEBOOK 
IT SAYS BOIL THE KETTLE 
ALL THAT FOR ALL THAT FOR BOIL THE KETTLE 
MIND YOU FOUR MINUTES IS NOT BAD 
I'M GOING TO INVEST IN OPTICAL TELEGRAPHY 
I THINK MOBILE PHONES HAVE HAD THEIR DAY 
BY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY ONE THE HOLYHEAD TO LIVERPOOL TELEGRAPH 
THE FIRST AND LAST COMMERCIAL OPTICAL TELEGRAPH SYSTEM IN THE U. K. 
HAD BECOME DEFUNCT SUPERSEDED BY THE ELECTRICAL TELEGRAPH
