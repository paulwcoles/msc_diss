THE TEAM MANAGING TAXPAYERS' MONEY 
AND SOUTH FACING SLOPES AND JOCKEYS 
ARE MAKES SURREY AN IDEAL PLACE FOR 
PRODUCING WINE L. AM AT ENGLAND'S 
LARGEST VINEYARDS OR HEAD OF 
ENGLISH WINE WEEK 
HELLO AND GOOD EVENING UP TO SIXTY 
PEOPLE ARE SPENDING A SECOND NIGHT 
IN HOTELS AFTER A HUGE EXPLOSION IN 
NORTH WEST LONDON WHICH DESTROYED 
THREE HOUSES AND LEFT ONE MAN DEAD 
THESE ARE SOME OF THE IMAGES OF THE 
AFTERMATH YOU SENT US TODAY POLICE 
HAVE NOT RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY 
THAT THE BLAST IN SOUTH HARROW WAS 
SPARKED DELIBERATELY EMMA NORTH 
HAS SPENT THE DAY THERE 
THEY USED TO BE THREE VICTORIAN 
TERRACED HOUSES HERE BUT A SINGLE 
EXPLOSION LAST NIGHT BLEW THEM TO 
BITS AND WATCHING THE DEBRIS IN 
STANLEY STREET THIS MORNING ONE 
MAN CREDITED WITH DRAGGING A SEVENTEEN 
YEAR OLD GIRL ALIVE FROM THE CHAOS 
I COULD HEAR SOMEBODY SHOUTING HELP 
I MANAGED TO FIND HER ON THE GROUND 
HER HAND WAS STICKING OUT OF THE 
RUBBLE AND I HELD ON TO HER HAND 
AND TOLD HER WE WERE GOING TO DIG 
OUT IT TOOK FIFTEEN MAYBE TWENTY MINUTES 
YEAH SHE WAS SHE LOOKED BADLY 
BURNED 
THE GIRL IS NOW IN A BURNED SPECIALIST BURNS UNIT ANOTHER MAN 
IS IN HOSPITAL WITH HEAD INJURIES 
BOTH IN A STABLE CONDITION WITH A 
COURT AND KEEPING THEM AT A SAFE 
DISTANCE FROM THEIR OWN HOMES 
THOSE WHO WITNESSED THE BLAST AND 
ITS AFTERMATH 
ONLY BY THE GRACE OF 
GOD THAT ANYONE CAME OUT OF THAT 
IN THAT HOUSE THERE WAS THREE 
CHILDREN AND MYSELF IF THE BUSTARD 
GONE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER I'M 
SORRY 
THEY HEARD A SCREAM SORRY WALKING PAST SCREEN PRETTY 
HORRIFIC SCENE 
FOLLOWING THE 
DISCOVERY OF A YOUNG ASIAN MAN'S 
BODY IN THE RUBBLE ONE OF SCOTLAND 
YARD'S TOP MURDER DETECTIVES HAS 
BEEN BROUGHT IN POLICE SAY THERE 
ARE NO SUGGESTIONS OF TERRORISM OR 
DRUGS BUT THE EXPLOSION WAS BIG 
ENOUGH TO DRAW THEIR ATTENTION 
TONIGHT IT REMAINS A MYSTERY WHAT 
HAPPENED AND AFTER BEING PUT UP IN 
HOTELS LAST NIGHT DOZENS HAVE NOW 
BEEN TOLD THEY STILL CANNOT GO HOME 
LONG TERM PLAN IS GET PEOPLE BACK 
INTO THEIR HOUSES THOSE THAT ARE 
SAFE TO GO BACK INTO IN THE 
SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME SOME 
BUILDINGS WILL HAVE TO BE PULLED 
DOWN WE WILL HELP OUR VERY CAN 
THE REMAINS OF THE DEAD MAN ARE 
STILL TRAPPED IN RUBBLE BUT IT IS 
TOO DANGEROUS FOR ANY RECOVERY TO 
START THAT IS NOT EXPECTED TO 
HAPPEN UNTIL AT LEAST TOMORROW 
STAY WITH US AT NOT MORE AHEAD 
HOW A DOLPHIN CARTOON CHARACTER 
CALLED HECTOR IS HELPING YOUNG 
LONDON SCHOOLCHILDREN STAY SAFE 
ONLINE 
ONE WEEK INTO HIS NEW JOB BORIS 
JOHNSON HAS STARTED WIELDING AXE 
WITH THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF 
TAXPAYERS' MONEY AT THE LONDON 
DEVELOPMENT AGENCY HIS FIRST TARGET 
TODAY HE ASKED HIS CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
AND CHAIR TO LEAVE THEIR JOBS HE 
HAS ALSO SET UP A PANEL OF EXPERTS 
TO LOOK OVER ITS ACCOUNTS THE MOVE 
FOLLOWS ALLEGATIONS SURROUNDING THE 
LDA AND THE FORMER MAYOR'S RACE 
ADVISER LEE JASPER OVER THE 
HANDED OUT OF GRANTS TO COMMUNITY 
GROUPS GROUPS JUST ONE WEEK AFTER THE ELECTION 
BORIS JOHNSON HAS ALREADY STARTED 
THE CLEAR OUT HIS FIRST TARGET 
THE LONDON DEVELOPMENT AGENCY OUT 
GO CHIEF EXECUTIVE MANNY LEWIS AND 
CHAIR MARY REILLY BOTH APPOINTED 
BY KEN LIVINGSTONE INCOME PETER 
ROGERS FROM WESTMINSTER COUNCIL AND 
BUSINESSMAN HARVEY MCGRATH 
TOGETHER THEY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THE LDA SPENDS 
EACH YEAR MONEY SPENT ON PROVIDING 
JOBS AND TRAINING FOR LONDONERS 
BUT BEFORE THE ELECTION IS WAS AT 
THE CENTRE OF ALLEGATIONS ABOUT 
HOWARD HANDED OUT GRANTS AND THE 
ROLE OF THE MAYOR'S CHIEF RACE 
ADVISER IN DECIDING AT WHERE THE 
MONEY WENT 
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT 
SIX ANXIETY ABOUT THE LDA THIS THIS WAS THE SECOND DAY AT THE LDA HOURS 
THE CAKE OF THE MORNING WITH A NEW 
PANEL OF EXPERTS BROUGHT IN TO GO 
THROUGH THEIR ACCOUNTS HE KATE 
OF THE MORNING THAT WILL REPORT 
BACK IN THIRTY DAYS' TIME HE SAID IT 
WAS NOT A WITCH HUNT 
INSOFAR AS 
THERE IS WASTE AND IN SO FAR AS WE 
DISCOVER THERE HAS BEEN MAN 
ADMINISTRATION THIS IS NOT A 
WITCH HUNT IF THERE HAS BEEN 
PROBLEMS WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE 
CHANGES 
SO THE MESSAGE FROM CITY CHANGES HALL WAS CLEAR NO RUSHING TO 
JUDGMENT AND THE WITCH AND TIME 
FOR A QUICK CUP OF COFFEE BUT 
BEFORE THE FROTH HAD EVEN SETTLED 
ON THIS WE GOT A PRESS RELEASE 
THROUGH SAY THAT MANNY LEWIS AND 
MARY REILLY HAD BEEN ASKED TO LEAVE 
THEIR JOBS THE MAYOR WAS NOT 
AVAILABLE FOR INTERVIEW AFTER THE 
DECISION WAS ANNOUNCED BUT 
THANKFULLY JUSTIN URQUHART STEWART 
WAS THREE MONTHS AGO THIS 
FINANCIAL EXPERT LOOK AT THE LDA 
ACCOUNTS FOR US 
THE BOOKS WE SAW 
BEFORE MOCKED AS IF THEY DID NOT 
HAVE PROPER CONTROL OF VALIDATION 
ON THEM AT ALL IF IT HAD BEEN A 
PUBLIC COMPANY THEY WOULD HAVE 
BEEN THROWN OUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY 
I FIND IT WHOLLY HEALTHY THAT THEY 
ARE STARTING AFRESH 
MANNY LEWIS 
AND MARY REILLY WILL STAY IN POST 
UNTIL THE BOARD BACKS THE MAYOR'S 
REQUEST A MEETING IS PLANNED FOR 
NEXT WEEK 
POLITICAL EDITOR TIM DONOVAN IS AT 
CITY HALL TONIGHT WHAT THESE TWO 
FIGURES HAVE EXPECTED TO STAY UNDER 
BORIS JOHNSON 
I DO NOT THINK THEY 
WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THEM TO BE 
IMPOSED IN A YEAR'S TIME PERHAPS 
IN A FEW MONTHS' TIME THEY WERE 
APPOINTED BY KEN LIVINGSTONE AND 
BORIS JOHNSON WANTS TO GET HIS OWN 
PEOPLE IN ALTHOUGH I'M TOLD MANNY 
LEWIS IS SURPRISED AT EASE WITH 
THIS OF ALL THIS THERE WAS 
SOMETHING ODD ABOUT THE WAY THIS 
WAS HANDLED TODAY FROM THE MAYOR 
PROMISING MORE TRANSPARENCY AND 
OPENNESS HE GAVE NO INDICATION 
WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THIS NEW 
INVESTIGATION THIS PANEL LOOKING 
AT PAST LDA SPENDING THAT HE WANTED 
TO SEE CHANGES AT THE TOP FOUR SAID 
HE SAID HE WAS NOT PREJUDGING THE 
INVESTIGATION THAT IT WOULD BE NO 
WITCH HUNT ONE HOUR LATER WE HEARD 
THAT HE WANTED TO SEE THE CHANGES 
WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE OUT SO CLEARLY 
HE HAS MADE HIS MIND UP THAT THERE 
ARE PROBLEMS AT THE TOP A SOURCE 
AT THE LDA TELL TO ME THAT HE MAY 
BE SAYING THERE'S NO WITCH HUNT 
BUT IF IT LOOKS AND SMELLS LIKE A 
WITCH HUNT THERE WE GO 
WHAT WILL 
THIS PANEL LOOK AT THAT HAS NOT 
BEEN EXAMINED ALREADY 
THAT IS AN 
INTERESTING QUESTION BECAUSE AFTER 
THIS NEGATIVE PUBLICITY ABOUT THE 
GROUNDS THAT THE UP AND OVER THESE 
LAST FEW MONTHS THE LDA HAS 
ALREADY PUT IN NEW PROCEDURES BUT 
REVIEWING HISTORIC FRANCE AND ABOUT 
HOW IT IS GOING TO MONITOR THE 
SPENDING OF MONEY IN FUTURE 
FRANCE THE AUDIT COMMISSION HAS 
BEEN HAPPY WITH THE PROCEDURES 
MANNY LEWIS AND HIS CHIEF FINANCE 
OFFICER BUT THOSE IN PLACE IT WILL 
BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT IS 
ORDERED PANEL WILL FIND WHEN IT 
FIND EXAMPLES OF WASTE AND 
INCOMPETENCE OR JUST EXAMPLES OF 
KEN LIVINGSTONE'S SPENDING ON 
THINGS THAT BORIS JOHNSON NO LONGER 
WANTS TO SPEND MONEY ON 
PARENTS IN LONDON ARE BEING WARNED 
TO TAKE THEIR CHILDREN ARE FULLY 
VACCINATED AGAINST DIPHTHERIA AFTER 
A CHILD DIED FROM THE DISEASE AT SAINT 
THOMAS'S HOSPITAL IT IS THE FIRST 
DEATH FROM THE STRAIN OF THE 
ILLNESS IN ENGLAND SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR 
SYMPTOMS TO LOOK OUT FOR INCLUDE 
SORE THROAT FEVER AND SWOLLEN 
LYMPH GLANDS IN THE NECK 
THE WIFE OF A BARRISTER SHOT DEAD 
BY POLICE IN CHELSEA HAS RELEASED 
STATEMENT SAYING SHE HAD A STRONG 
UNION WITH HER HUSBAND AND THE 
COUPLE WERE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO 
EACH OTHER MARK SAUNDERS WIFE HAS 
DENIED BEING AT HOME WITH HER 
HUSBAND BEFORE THE FIVE HOUR STAND 
OFF WITH POLICE MARKSMEN TUESDAY 
AND AN INVESTIGATION IS UNDER WAY 
AFTER AN EXPLOSION AT AN 
ELECTRICITY SUB STATION IN ESSEX 
WHICH LEFT ONE MAN DEAD THE BLAST 
IN CHELMSFORD LEFT NEARBY SHOPS AND 
HOUSES WITHOUT POWER THOUSANDS OF 
STUDENTS FROM ANGLIA RUSKIN 
UNIVERSITY HAD TO BE EVACUATED 
A NEW SCHEME HAS BEEN LODGED TO 
TEACH CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS FIVE 
ABOUT THE DANGERS OF THE INTERNET 
LAUNCH CEOP HAS DEVELOPED 
SERIES OF ANIMATED VIDEOS FOR 
YOUNGSTERS SARAH HARRIS VISITED A 
SCHOOL IN WESTMINSTER TO FIND OUT 
HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS 
CHILDREN AT SAINT VINCENT DE PAUL 
ROMAN CATHOLIC SCHOOL AND 
WESTMINSTER KNOW ALL ABOUT HOW TO 
GET ON LINE FROM YOUNG AGE WHILE 
TEACHERS WELCOME COMPUTER LITERACY 
THEY HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE NUMBERS OF 
YOUNG CHILDREN SURFING THE INTERNET 
AT HOME UNSUPERVISED 
I THINK A LOT 
OF PARENTS ARE NOT AWARE IN THE 
HOME OF WHAT CHILDREN DO ON THE 
INTERNET AND IF IT COMES FROM 
SCHOOLS IT IS PROBABLY TAKEN A BIT 
MORE SERIOUSLY 
THERE ARE SIX HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND 
PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN IN AND 
AROUND LONDON AND OF THOSE MORE 
THAN SIXTY PER CENT HAVE ACCESS TO THE 
INTERNET AT HOME MORE THAN TWENTY PER CENT OF 
THOSE CAN USE IT EVELYN THEM ARE 
MORE THEIR DAD ON NOT SUPERVISING 
THEM HECTOR THE DOLPHIN IS THE 
STAR OF A CAMPAIGN TO HELP CHILDREN 
UNDERSTAND THE DANGERS OF GOING 
ONLINE HE AND HIS FRIENDS LEARN TO 
SURF SAFELY THROUGH THE INTERNET 
OCEAN 
MAYBE IT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA OCEAN TO PUT DOWN ALL THAT STUFF WE WE DON'T WANT TO SCARE CHILDREN AT 
WHAT THEY'RE DOING ON LINE IS 
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SO WE HAVE 
TAKEN A SOFTER APPROACH LOOK AT 
THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THEY ARE 
PLACING ON LINE AND WE HAVE 
CREATED A CARTOON WHICH IDENTIFY AS 
WITHOUT CHILDREN FEEL IN THE ONLINE 
ENVIRONMENT 
YOU NEED TO BE VERY ENVIRONMENT CAREFUL WHEN YOU MAKE FRIENDS 
BECAUSE MAYBE THEY ARE A STRANGER 
MY BIG SISTER SHE TALKS TO 
STRANGERS 
WHO CAN TELL ME WHAT IS STRANGERS NOT GOOD ABOUT USING THE INTERNET 
MOST CHILDREN KNOW THEY SHOULD NOT 
TALK TO STRANGERS ON THE STREET 
BUT ONLINE IS NOT SO OBVIOUS THE 
PLAN IS BAGHDAD HIS FRIENDS WILL 
MAKE THAT MESSAGE JUST AS CLEAR 
HECTOR AND HIS FRIENDS 
IT HAS BEEN THE DREAM OF YOUNG BOYS 
AND GIRLS SINCE SPACE TRAVEL BEGAN 
THE CHANCE TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT 
NOW THAT DREAM COULD BECOME 
REALITY THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY 
HAS BEEN IN LONDON TODAY TRYING TO 
RECRUIT WOULD BE ASKED TO MARS 
VICTO R. I. A. HOLLANDS IS AT THE 
GREENWICH OBSERVATORY THIS EVENING 
SO ONE LUCKY PERSON COULD END UP ON 
THE MOON 
ABSOLUTELY ON THE MOAN OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION FOR 
THE REST OF US THE GREENWICH 
OBSERVATORY IS ABOUT AS CLOSE AS WE 
ARE GOING TO GET THE ORIGINAL HOME 
OF ASTRONOMY APPLICATIONS ARE OPEN 
IF YOU WANT TO GET THAT LITTLE BIT 
CLOSER BUT THE CRITERIA ARE PRETTY 
TOUGH 
ASTRONAUTS WELCOME NO EXPERIENCE 
NECESSARY TWENTY YEARS AGO A BRITISH 
SCIENTIST HELEN SHARMAN AND SITS 
JUST SUCH AN ADVERT AND BECAME AN 
ASTRONAUT ON THE RUSSIAN SPACE 
STATION NEAR NOW THE EUROPEAN 
SPACE AGENCY IS APPEALING FOR 
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO APPLY TO 
ITS ASTRONAUT CORPS CANDIDATES 
SHOULD BE BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWENTY SEVEN 
AND THIRTY SEVEN THEY SHOULD HAVE A SCIENCE 
ENGINEERING OR MEDICAL DEGREE AND 
THEY NEED TO BE PSYCHOLOGICALLY 
STABLE TO DEAL WITH THE RISKS AND 
THRILLS OF SPACE TRAVEL 
AT A RECRUITMENT DRIVE IN CENTRAL 
LONDON EARLIER YOUNG HOPEFULS WERE 
ALREADY PUTTING IN THEIR 
APPLICATIONS 
I HAVE WANTED TO APPLICATIONS BEING ASKED NOT SINCE I WAS TWELVE MY 
ENTIRE LIFE I HAVE BEEN REALLY 
AMBITIOUS AND REALLY DETERMINED WE WE ARE INTERESTED IN YOUNG PEOPLE WHO 
ARE WILLING AND READY TO EXPLORE 
WHO FEEL THE URGE TO EXPLORE HE 
WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THE 
UNKNOWN 
BUT BRITISH APPLICATIONS UNKNOWN MAY NOT GET OFF THE GROUND THAT IS 
BECAUSE FOR YEARS THE U. K. HAS NOT 
PAID TO TAKE PART IN THE EUROPEAN 
ASTRONAUT PROGRAMME BUT THE 
COMPETITION IS PRETTY TOUGH 
SOMEBODY WHO WAS PREPARED TO TAKE 
ON THAT CHALLENGE IS KATHERINE JOY 
A HOPEFUL APPLICANTS AND A LUNAR 
GEOLOGISTS WHY ON EARTH DO YOU 
WANT TO DO THIS 
IT SOUNDS LIKE A 
TOUGH CHALLENGE DOESN'T IT L. HAVE 
ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN SPACE 
EXPLORATION AND ASTRONOMY AND 
STUDYING GEOLOGY AND LUNAR GEOLOGY 
AT UNIVERSITY HAS GIVEN ME AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK DOWN AND OUR 
PLANET AT WHAT IS IT FROM ABOVE AND 
UNDERSTAND THE PROCESSES L. AM 
MOTIVATED BY THE IDEA OF GOING TO 
THE MOON HOW AMAZING WOULD THAT 
BE 
THE PHYSICAL CHALLENGES ARE BE TOUGH 
VERY TOUGH THERE IS GOING TOUGH TO BE A LOT OF EXERCISING AND 
GETTING READY MENTALLY AND 
PHYSICALLY PREPARING FOR THE 
CHALLENGE BUT HOPEFULLY I'LL BE 
HAVE TO FACE UP TO THOSE CHALLENGES 
GOOD LUCK I THINK YOU WILL NEED IT 
AT THE MOMENT WE KNOW THERE ARE 
ABOUT TEN THOUSAND APPLICANTS BUT THEY 
COULD BE UP TO FORTY THOUSAND IF THAT DOES 
NOT PUT YOU OFF YOU HAVE UNTIL 
FIFTEENTH JUNE TO GET YOUR APPLICATION 
IN IN BUT WHAT AN UNBELIEVABLE 
OPPORTUNITY STILL TO COME BEFORE 
SEVEN AS THE FINAL WEEKEND OF THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE SEASON APPROACHES 
WILL FOUR POLL OF THE GREAT ESCAPE 
AS AND THEY ARE THE PREMIERSHIP 
FOOTBALLERS OF CONTEMPORARY DANCE 
CELEBRATED TALENT AND NO TOYS THE 
BALLET BOYZ BRING THEIR GREATEST 
HITS TO SADLER'S WELLS 
AMIDST GROWING CONCERN THAT ALLOW 
ARMED FORCES ARE NOT GETTING THE 
RECEPTION THEY DESERVE WHEN THEY 
RETURN HOME THOUSANDS ARE EXPECTED 
AT WINDSOR CASTLE TONIGHT TO GIVE 
BRITISH TROOPS A HERO'S WELCOME 
THERE WILL BE A MILITARY MUSICAL 
CELEBRATION THERE OVER THE NEXT FEW 
NIGHTS THE FIRST TIME SUCH AN 
EVENT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE CASTLE 
GROUNDS GROUNDS A MOCK BATTLE WITHIN RANGE OF 
WINDSOR CASTLE BUT IT WON'T 
BOTHER THE ROYALS THE QUEEN 
APPROVED THIS EVENT THE FIRST 
MILITARY TATTOO AT WINDSOR IT IS 
FOR SOLDIERS LIKE TRIPPER MATTHEW 
JACQUES FROM EPSOM IN SURREY WHO 
HAS SEEN ACTION IN IRAQ AND FOUND 
NOT EVERYONE AT HOME AGREES WITH 
HIS ROLE TROOPER 
SOMEONE HAS 
SAID THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WRONG 
WE'RE DOING IT FOR THE WRONG 
REASONS BUT I DISAGREE 
THE IDEA 
IS THAT SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN WHO 
HAVE SEEN ACTION WILL GET A HERO'S 
WELCOME HOME OVER THE NEXT THREE 
NIGHTS 
THE AIR IS A GENERAL SWELL NIGHTS OF FEELING IN THE COUNTRY THAT HAS 
DEVELOPED PARTICULARLY OVER THE 
LAST FEW MONTHS THAT NOTHING HAS 
BEEN DONE TO SHOW GRATITUDE AND 
THERE IS 
THERE WILL BE SOME PEOPLE 
WHO THINK THIS EVENT SHOULD NOT BE 
STAGED BECAUSE THEY DO NOT BELIEVE 
BRITISH TROOPS SHOULD BE IN IRAQ 
AND AFGHANISTAN BUT THE INVITED 
AUDIENCE FOR THIS DRESS REHEARSAL 
CERTAINLY APPROVED 
RETAKE IT FOR 
GRANTED I THINK OUR HEROES THEY 
ARE HEROES SHOULD BE RECOGNISED 
WE HAVE SUCH BUSY LIVES THAT IT IS 
EASY TO FORGET THEY ARE FIGHTING 
FOR AS 
MY SON IS IN AFGHANISTAN AT 
THE MOMENT AND THEY NEED OUR 
SUPPORT 
WHAT DID THE TRICK BUT SUPPORT THINK OF HIS WELCOME HOME 
IT SHOWS 
THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT WHAT WE DID 
FOR THE COUNTRY 
WHAT DID IT FEEL 
LIKE TO BE IN THE MARCH PAST IT IT FELT GOOD BECAUSE OF WHAT WE HAVE 
BEEN THROUGH LOTS OF PEOPLE CAME 
TO WATCH US AND SEE THEIR HEROES 
IT WAS REALLY GOOD UNNECESSARY UNNECESSARY JINGOISM OR AN IMPORTANT 
DEVELOPMENT IN A TIME OF CONFLICT 
UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WILL ATTEND AND 
MAKE UP THEIR MINDS WITH 
ORGANISERS SAYING IT IS A SELL OUT 
MORE MONEY A SPEND ON WINE IN 
LONDON'S RESTAURANTS THAN ALMOST 
ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD IS 
SPENT SOUTH EAST ENGLAND'S 
REPUTATION FOR PRODUCTION IS ALSO 
GROWING STRONGER BY THE AIR THE 
BIGGEST VINEYARD IN ENGLAND HAS 
JUST OUTSIDE DORKING IN SURREY 
WHERE WE JOIN KATHARINE CARPENTER 
ALL IN DAY'S WORK 
IT IS A HARD 
LIFE THIS VINEYARD IS BLESSED WITH 
SOUTH FACING SLOPES AND CHALKY SOIL 
IT HAS SEEN A SLOW INCREASE IN THE 
POPULARITY OF ENGLISH WINES WITH 
ENGLISH WINE WEEK ONLY A FORTNIGHT 
AWAY IT HOPES WE WILL ALL START 
ENJOYING A MORE LOCAL TIPPLE 
QUEUING UP TO LEARN THEIR CHABLIS 
FROM THEIR CHARDONNAY THE SHERAZ 
FROM THEIR SAUVIGNON OVER THE NEXT 
TWO WEEKS VISITORS TO THIS WINE 
TASTING EXPERIENCE WILL BE 
ENCOURAGED TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH 
MORE HOME GROWN GRAPES WINE EXPERT 
OZ CLARKE SAYS THERE IS PLENTY TO 
BE PROUD OF 
THAT IS CLASS 
CHAMPAGNE IN EVERYTHING BUT NAME 
IT IS MADE BY THE SAME METHOD THE 
SAME GRAPE ON THE SAME SOIL AS 
CHAMPAGNE IT WILL TASTE JUST LIKE 
PETER FOR CHAMPAGNE 
WHAT DO 
UNTRAINED NURSES MAKE OF ENGLISH 
WINE 
VERY NICE AND FRESH VERY WINE CRISPY 
MEDIAN TWENTY IT TENDS TO BE A CRISPY FOUR BOTTLE OF BLOSSOM HILL 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS REALLY NICE 
AND ME BEING TWENTY 
WHAT YOU PICK 
ENGLISH WINE IN THE FUTURE 
IF IT 
TASTED LIKE THIS WOULD YOU 
PRODUCERS LIKE THIS ONE ARE SO KEEN 
TO TEACH US ABOUT ENGLISH WINE 
THERE WERE VINEYARDS IN SERIE IN 
ROMAN TIMES BUT THE JUDGES TO 
FIRST SAW THE POTENTIAL OF THIS 
SITE SAYS THE SOUTH EAST SHOULD 
MAKE THE MOST OF GREAT GROWING 
CONDITIONS WHERE THEY LAST THE 
GEOLOGIST 
AS TEMPERATURES CONTINUE GEOLOGIST TO RISE VARIETIES WHICH WILL 
PRODUCE RED WINE WILL FLOURISH 
OVER THE NEXT WINTER OF THIRTY YEARS 
WE WILL SEE INCREASING AMOUNT OF 
RED WINE PRODUCED IN ENGLAND AS 
THE TEMPERATURE CONTINUES TO RISE 
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BY THE END OF 
THE CENTURY CERTAINLY IN SOUTHERN 
ENGLAND TEMPERATURES MAY BE TOO 
HIGH FOR WINEMAKING AT ALL MORE MORE VINES WERE BEING PLANTED TODAY 
DESIRE FOR ENGLISH WINE IS 
INCREASING AND PRODUCERS ARE 
TRYING TO KEEP UP THE GENERAL 
MANAGER OF DENBIGH IS CHRISTOPHER 
WHITE HE IS WITH US TODAY 
CHRISTOPHER HOW MUCH OF THIS ARE 
YOU SELLING 
ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND BOTTLES 
THE AIR WE HAVE SEEN A GROWTH IN 
SALES OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM IS 
KEEPING UP WITH DEMAND 
DO YOU 
THINK THAT ENGLISH WINE IS A 
NOVELTY OR DO PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIKE 
IT 
IT WAS A NOVELTY HISTORICALLY IT THERE HAS BEEN LOTS OF INVESTMENT 
IN THE INDUSTRY AND I THINK THAT 
IS KEY TO ANY SERIOUS BUSINESS 
YEAR AFTER YEAR IT IS GOING UP 
DRAMATICALLY 
THE ONE THING THAT DRAMATICALLY PERHAPS PUT SOME PEOPLE OFF HIS 
MONEY YOU CAN BUY OTHER WINES MORE 
CHEAPLY 
THAT IS A MISCONCEPTION CHEAPLY ESPECIALLY NOW WITH THE INCREASED 
VALUE OF THE EURO FOR EXAMPLE AND 
INCREASED DISTRIBUTION COSTS IT IS 
VERY COMPETITIVE NOW 
VERY BRIEFLY 
SOMETHING LIKE YOU ARE HOLDING IN 
YOUR HANDS HOW MUCH 
THIS IS OUR 
FLAGSHIP SPARKLING WINE IT RETAILS 
AT TWENTY ONE 
PERHAPS NOT EVERYONE WOULD 
THINK THAT IS A BARGAIN BUT THEY 
ARE HOPING THAT SOME ENGLISH WINES 
WILL BE ON THE TABLE AT THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
OLYMPICS OLYMPICS WE WILL LEAVE YOU TO THE TASTING 
IT IS WORTH MILLIONS THAT IS THE 
VIEW OF FULHAM ON THEIR FINAL MATCH 
OF THE SEASON THIS WEEKEND IT IS 
ONE OF THEIR BIGGEST GAMES IN YEARS 
A WIN WOULD GUARANTEE THEIR 
PREMIER LEAGUE SURVIVAL ANY OTHER 
RESULT AND THE CLUB MAY WELL BE 
RELEGATED FROM THE WORLD'S RICHEST 
LEAGUE LEAGUE REAL HOPE FOR FULHAM THEY WILL GO 
TO PORTSMOUTH LAST DAY OF THIS 
SEASON WITH THEIR SURVIVAL 
PROSPECTS STILL INTACT 
IT HAS COME 
DOWN TO THIS THE THIRTY EIGHTH AND FINAL 
MATCH OF THE SEASON FULHAM HAVE A 
CHANCE OF STAYING UP FOUR WEEKS 
AGO PRETTY MUCH NO CHANCE BUT NOW 
THEY BELIEVE 
THIS WILL PROVE IF AL 
FAYED STILL PROVES CARES IF WE 
GO DOWN WE WOULD FALL APART IF HE 
PULLED OUT 
WHAT YOU THINK HE WILL 
DO 
I 
THINK HE WILL STAY BUT I DO THINK WE WILL STAY UP ANYWAY WE WE WERE IN A DIRE SITUATION BASICALLY 
TO USE THE OLD CLICHE WE HAVE BEEN 
DEAD AND BURIED FOR A LONG TIME 
ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY HAVE SAID TO 
US WELL LOOK IF YOU WIN YOUR LAST 
GAME MAY BE ONE UP IN THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
ELEVEN YEARS AGO MOHAMED CHAMPIONSHIP AL FAYED SAID THIS 
I GOT A CHANCE 
TO HELP IT WILL BE ANOTHER GREAT 
FOOTBALL CLUB 
HE PROMISE TO MAKE 
FROM THE MANCHESTER UNITED OF THE 
SOUTH FIGHTING RELEGATION IS NOT 
QUITE THE SAME FULHAM DO NOT WANT 
THIS TO HAPPEN AGAIN 
IT IS TWO 
YEARS WHERE THE CLUB HAS BEEN 
STARING RELEGATION IN THE FACE THE 
FIRST THING WE WOULD HAVE TO THINK 
ABOUT DOING IS MAKING A FOUNDATION 
STRONGER 
THAT MEANS MONEY THE STRONGER PREMIER LEAGUERS WHETHER MONEY WAS 
THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO GO DOWN 
PREMIER LEAGUE YEARS 
QPR MANAGER LIZZIE LUIGI DI CANIO 
HAS LEFT AFTER SEVEN MONTHS THE 
CLUB'S WEALTHY OWNERS ARE THOUGHT

WIND PICKS UP IT WILL BREAK THE 
CLOUD UP BY THE AFTERNOON PLENTY

AGAIN GETTING UP TO TWENTY SIX CELSIUS TWENTY THREE 
IS A BETTER GUIDE TEMPERATURE FOR 
MOST OF US OVER THE WEEKEND THE 
TWO AREAS OF HIGH PRESSURE EITHER 
SIDE OF THE BRITISH ISLES WILL JOIN 
FORCES WE WILL END UP WITH ONE BIG 
HIGH CENTRED OVER SCOTLAND A 
FAIRLY WEAK WEATHER FRONT HEADING 
DOWN TOWARDS SOUTHERN ENGLAND THAT 
WILL MEAN A BIT OF A SCORCHED ON 
SATURDAY AGAIN BUT A LITTLE BIT 
MORE CLOUD IN THE SKY FOR SUNDAY 
FROM THAT WEAK WEATHER FRONT 
TEMPERATURES WILL PROBABLY BE DOWN 
TWO OR THREE DEGREES ON SATURDAY S. 
APART FROM THAT LITTLE BIT OF RAIN
