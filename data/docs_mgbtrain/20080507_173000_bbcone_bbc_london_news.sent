A UNION SAYS THE 
WILL CHANGE IDEA IS A JOKE WE ASK WHAT IT 
MEANS FOR FUTURE RELATIONS BETWEEN 
THE TWO ALSO TONIGHT ANGER AS THE 
AXE FALLS ON ONE HUNDRED FIFTY OF THE CAPITAL'S 
POST OFFICES 
WE WILL BE LIFE AT SAINT PAULS AHEAD 
OF A SPECTACULAR PAGEANT RAISING 
MONEY FOR INJURED SERVICEMEN AND 
WOMEN PLUS AN EMOTIONAL MEETING 
AFTER SIXTY FIVE YEARS THE R. A. F. NAVIGATER 
AND THE DUTCHMAN WHO SAW HIM FALL 
FROM THE SKY 
GOOD EVENING WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMME HALFWAY THROUGH HIS 
FIRST WEEK OF BEING MAYOR AND BORIS 
JOHNSON HAS HAD HIS FIRST RUN IN 
WITH THE TUBE UNION TODAY HE 
ANNOUNCED AN ALCOHOL BAN ON THE 
TRANSPORT SYSTEM FROM THE FIRST JUNE 
CARRYING OPEN CONTAINERS OF ALCOHOL 
WILL BE ILLEGAL ON THE UNDERGROUND 
BUSES AND D. L. R. BUT THE IDEA HAS 
BEEN MOCKED AS UNWORKABLE BY THE 
HEAD OF THE RMT UNION WE CAN CROSS 
TO OUR TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT TOM 
EDWARDS AT BAKER STREET DOES THIS 
BODE WELL FOR A GOOD WORKING 
RELATIONSHIP 
WELL THE RMT UNION RELATIONSHIP SAY THEY DO WANT A GOOD WORKING 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NEW MAYOR 
BUT THEY'RE ANNOYED THEY WEREN'T 
CONSULTED ABOUT THIS NEW 
ANNOUNCEMENT EITHER WAY FROM JUNE 
FIRST IT MEANS YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO 
DRINK THIS ON THE TUBE OR BUSES 
BORIS JOHNSON'S FIRST NEW POLICY 
AND A SHOW OF SOLIDARITY BETWEEN 
THE NEW MAYOR AND THE TRANSPORT 
COMMISSIONER BOOZE WILL NOW BE 
BANNED ON BUSES AND THE TUBE AND 
TRAM THE STAFF WE HAVE SPOKEN TO 
HAVE DOUBTS THEY WILL BE ABLE TO 
POLICE THIS 
I THINK YOU ARE GOING 
TO FIND THAT IT DOES WORK AND THAT 
PEOPLE NATURALLY DECIDE THAT THEY 
DON'T WANT TO SEE A CLIMATE IN 
WHICH PEOPLE CAN DRINK ALCOHOL ON 
THE TUBE ON THE BUSES IN A WAY 
THAT'S THREATENING AND IMTIM DATING 
ONCE INTIMIDATING EVERYONE 
EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THIS IS NOT 
ALLOWED THE CLIMATE WILL WILL 
CHANGE 
INITIALLY A NEW CHANGE ANNOUNCEMENT WILL GREET THOSE 
DRINKING ALCOHOL THE AIM TO 
CRACKDOWN ON DRUNKENNESS AND ANTI 
SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR ON PUBLIC 
TRANSPORT THOSE DRINKING WILL BE 
ASKED TO LEAVE OR REFUSED ENTRY 
BUT IN THE FUTURE IT WILL BECOME 
ILLEGAL AND THAT MEANS FINES IT'S 
BEEN BACKED BY SOME UNIONS AND 
PASSENGERS 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT PASSENGERS BANNING IT SPECIFICALLY IT 
PROBABLY WORK OUT THE BEST IN THE 
LONG RUN DEFINITELY 
THERE SHOULD 
BE SAFE TRAVEL LIKE ON THE TUBES 
AND BUSES AND THEREFORE I BELIEVE 
IT IS A GOOD DECISION TRANSPORT TRANSPORT FOR FOR LONDON ARE INTRODUCING THIS 
BAN BY CHANGING THE CONDITIONS OF 
CARAGE IT WILL CARRIAGE IT WILL 
LEAVE US WITH AN ANOMALY IN LONDON 
FOR THE MOMENT YOU WILL STILL BE 
ABLE TO DRINK ALCOHOL ON TRAINS 
THERE IS NO DOUBT THERE WILL BE 
MORE CHALLENGES NEW POLICIES AHEAD 
TO INTRODUCE FOR TRANSPORT FOR 
LONDON BUT THEY SAY THEY'RE 
EMBRACING THE CHANGES 
WE ARE BIG ORGANISATION WE HAVE 
CAPABLE PEOPLE HERE AND WHAT THE 
MAYOR SAYS WE DO 
YOU CAN WORK WITH 
THE MAYOR IN THE FUTURE NO DOUBT 
ABOUT THAT 
LOOKS LIKE IT 
THE RMT 
UNION THOUGH SAYS IT HASN'T BEEN 
CONSULTED AND IF STAFF INTERVENE IT 
COULD MAKE MATTERS WORSE 
IS HE 
GOING TO COME DOWN TO LONDON 
UNDERGROUND LIKE SUPERMAN PUT HIS 
UNDERPANTS ON AND SAY I WILL TAKE A 
CAN OF BEER OFF PEOPLE PERHAPS HE 
SHOULD WAIT FOR THE LIVERPOOL FANS 
HE IS GOOD FRIENDS WITH THEM AND 
SKWRUFR ON TO THE TRAIN AND SAY I 
AM GOING TO TAKE YOUR BEER OFF YOU 
IT'S NOT BEEN THOUGHT OUT 
TRANSPORT FOR LONDON SAYS IT WILL 
CONSULT WITH STAFF OVER THE NEXT 
MONTH BUT ALCOHOL WILL BE BANNED 
ON BUSES AND THE TUBE FROM JUNE FIRST 
IT HAS TO BE SAID ANOTHER TUBE 
UNION THE TSSA THINK THIS IS A 
GREAT IDEA IT SEEMS FOR THE RMT 
UNION THEY'LL NEED MORE CONVINCE 
WILLING 
CONVINCING WILLING DETECTIVES INVESTIGATING THE FATAL 
STABBING OF A TEENAGER IN SOUTHWARK 
HAVE ARRESTED A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD IN 
CONNECTION WITH HIS MURDER FIFTEEN 
YEAR OLD LYLE TULLOCH WAS STABBED 
TO DEATH ON A STAIRWAY IN A HOUSING 
ESTATE IN PECKHAM LAST SATURDAY A 
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH 
HIS MURDER 
PLANS FOR A NEW CONTAINER PORT ON 
THE THAMES ESTUARY HAVE BEEN GIVEN 
THE GO AHEAD BY THE GOVERNMENT THE 
DEPARTMENT FOR TRANSPORT HAS GIVEN 
PERMISSION FOR CONSTRUCTION WORK TO 
BEGIN ON THE SITE WHICH IS WHICH 
IS TWENTY FIVE MILES FROM CENTRAL LONDON 
THE PORT WILL COST ONE POINT FIVE BILLION TO 
BUILD BUILD THAMES WATER SAYS EVERY HOME IT 
SUPPLIES WILL HAVE A WATER METRE BY 
TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THE COMPANY SAYS IT'S THE 
ONLY WAY TO PREVENT SHORTAGES 
TODAY IT PUBLISHED ITS STRATEGY FOR 
THE FUTURE AND SAYS ITS PRIORITY 
WILL BE TO CUT LEAKS THE COMPANY 
ADMITS THAT ITS PAST PERFORMANCE 
COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER UNDER NEW 
OWNERSHIP AND NEW MANAGEMENT WE ARE 
HITTING LEAKAGE TARGETS SOME 
PEOPLE WOULD SAY ABOUT TIME TOO 
THAT'S RIGHT TWO YEARS RUNNING WE 
HIT THE TARGETS AND ARE FOCUSED ON 
CONTINUING TO HIT THEM IT'S A LONG 
PROGRAMME IT'S DISRUPTIVE WE HAVE 
FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY STREETS DUG UP IN LONDON AT ANY 
ONE TIME 
IT'S A ROLLING PROGRAMME 
IT NEEDS TO BE DONE WE ARE GOING 
TO KEEP DOING IT 
FARMERS IN THE SAOUS ARE BEING URGE 
SOUTH EAST IN ARE BEING AOURGED 
TO USE A NEW VACCINE AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE TO PROTECT LIVESTOCK 
AGAINST THE BLUETONGUE DISEASE 
EARLIER THIS YEAR CASES WERE FOUND 
IN UXBRIDGE AND WATFORD NOW THE 
HOT WEATHER IS INCREASING THE RISK 
FROM BITING PHEUPBLGS THAT SPREAD 
THE VIRUS EVOLUME HALL I IMAGINE 
SOME AM WORRIED FARMERS THERE 
YES INDEED IT'S NOT JUST THE 
CATTLE AND SHEEP FARMERS THESE 
FANTASTIC CREATURES ARE PART OF A 
HERD OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY NEAR MORDEN THIS 
FARMER AND HIS WIFE ARE INOCULATING 
THE HERD TONIGHT WITH THE NEW 
VACCINE LIKE PETER HUNDREDS OF 
FARMERS ACROSS THE SOUTH EAST ARE 
DESPERATELY TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR 
LIVESTOCK LIVESTOCK A HEALTHY JERSEY HERD AT THIS FARM 
IN KINGS LANGLEY BUT THESE COWS 
ARE INCREASINGLY AT RISK FROM THE 
DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF BLUETONGUE 
DISEASE DISEASE SHEEP ARE THE WORST SUFFERERS OF 
THE DISEASE YOU CAN EXPECT QUITE 
HEAVY LOSSES OF MORTALITY AND VERY 
SICK ANIMALS CATTLE ALSO GET THE 
DISEASE BADLY BUT IT'S NOT QUITE 
SO SEVERE AS WITH SHEEP 
THIS IS 
WHAT BLUETONGUE LOOKS LIKE IT 
MAINLY AFFECTS CATTLE AND SHEEP 
IT'S KILLED THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS IN 
HOLLAND FRANCE AND GERMANY BITING 
MIDGES HAVE PARADE IT TO ENGLAND 
THE SPREAD IT TO ENGLAND THERE 
ARE NOW TWO OFFICIAL BLUETONGUE 
PROTECTION ZONES EAST ANGLIA IN 
THE SOUTH EAST AND PART OF DORSET 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN CASES HAVE BEEN FOUND SO FAR 
ONE NEAR WATFORD JUST A FEW WEEKS 
AGO THIS IS WHAT FARMERS HERE HAVE 
BEEN DESPERATE TO GET HOLD OF THE 
FIRST EVER VACCINE AGAINST 
BLUETONGUE BUT IT ONLY ATTACKS ONE 
STRAIN OF THE DISEASE A DIFFERENT 
TYPE HAS ALREADY BEEN FOUND IN 
FRANCE AND THERE ARE TWENTY TWO OTHERS 
ACROSS THE WORLD THE GOVERNMENT'S 
BEING URGED TO START PREPARING FOR 
MORE STRAINS POSSIBLY ARRIVING IN 
THE U. K. 
THEY'VE JUST GOT TO BE VERY 
VIGILANT AND KEEP CHECKING WHAT 
STRAINS OF THE VIRUS WE HAVE GOT 
AND KEEP PRODUCING THE VACCINES FOR 
THE DIFFERENT STRAINS HOPEFULLY IN 
ONE INJECTION WE ARE TOTALLY IN 
THEIR HANDS AND OUR LIVELIHOODS ARE 
IN THEIR HANDS REALLY 
WELL THOSE SENTIMENTS YOU HEARD 
THERE ARE FELT THROUGHOUT THE 
FARMING COMMUNITY PETER IS HERE 
NOW INOCULATING HIS HERD HOW HAS 
BLUETONGUE ALREADY AFFECTED YOUR 
BUSINESS 
WELL I THINK PEOPLE ARE BUSINESS VERY NERVOUS ABOUT COMING IN TO THE 
LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY WITH DISEASES 
SUCH AS BLUETONGUE AROUND PART OF 
OUR BUSINESS APART FROM SUPPLYING 
THE WOOL IS WE BREED ALPACAS AND 
SELL THEM TO NEW FARMERS THERE IS 
A RELUCTANCE GENERALLY TO VENTURE 
INTO LIVESTOCK INDUSTRIES 
YOU HAD 
A BIG NATIONAL SHOWCOUNCIL IT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THIS WEEKEND 
COMING UP IT WAS CANCELLED BECAUSE 
THE COUNTRY IS DIVIDED INTO ZONES 
AND MANY PEOPLE CAN'T CROSS ZONES 
SO IT WAS NOT THOUGHT RIGHT TO HAVE 
A NATIONAL SHOW THAT HALF THE 
BREEDERS COULD NOT GET TO 
BLUETONGUE HAS BEEN TRACKED COMING 
UP THROUGH EUROPE FOR YEARS HOW 
SURPRISED ARE YOU THAT YOU ARE ONLY 
NOW GETTING THE VACCINE 
WELL WE 
ARE A LITTLE SURPRISED WE ARE 
RELIEVED TO HAVE IT TODAY BUT WE 
WERE AWARE THAT BLUETONGUE WAS 
COMING UP THROUGH NORTHERN EUROPE 
AND FOR A YEAR OR TWO THEY'VE HAD 
IT CREEPING UP TO BELGIUM IT WAS A 
QUESTION OF TIME BEFORE IT CAME 
ACROSS THE CHANNEL WE WOULD LIKE 
TO HAVE HAD THE VACCINE BEFORE THE 
DISEASE ARRIVED AT LEAST WE HAVE 
IT NOW 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
WELL THE VACCINE ABSOLUTELY OFFERS 
NO GUARANTEE THAT IS IT WILL STOP 
THE SPREAD OF BLUETONGUE FARMERS 
KNOW THAT BUT THEY ALSO KNOW THAT 
IT IS THEIR ONLY HOPE 
ONE PERSON HAS BEEN KILLED AFTER AN 
EXPLOSION AND SERIOUS FIRE AT AN 
ELECTRICITY SUBSTATION IN 
CHELMSFORD AN EXCLUSION ZONE IS 
NOW IN PLACE AROUND THE SITE NEAR 
ANGLIA RUSKIN UNIVERSITY RICHARD 
DANIEL IS THERE FOR US WHAT 
EXACTLY HAPPENED 
WELL IT WAS 
ABOUT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THIS LUNCHTIME IN THE 
HEART OF THE UNIVERSITY'S CAMPUS 
HERE THERE WAS A HUGE EXPLOSION 
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEE THE 
SUBSTATION STILL SMOULDERING WHAT 
FOLLOWED WAS A VERY INTENSE FIRE 
AND A POOL OF SMOKE BILLOWED INTO 
THE AIR AND FLOATED OVER HOMES 
NEARBY IT WAS SO BAD THAT THE 
POLICE LAUNCHED THEIR HELICOPTER 
AND THEY WERE SHOUTING THROUGH 
AMEGAPHONE WARNING PEOPLE TO SHUT 
THEIR DOORS AND WINDOWS HERE AT 
THE UNIVERSITY MEANWHILE THE ENTIRE 
CAMPUS WAS EVACUATED ALL EIGHT THOUSAND 
STUDENTS WERE TOLD TO LEAVE THEN 
BY MID AFTERNOON THIS AFTERNOON THE 
FIRE WAS STILL RAGING IT EMERGED 
THAT THAT ONE PERSON HAD DIED AND 
FIREFIGHTERS BROUGHT IN FOAM TO TRY 
AND DOUSE THE FLAMES 
WHAT MORE DO 
WE KNOW ABOUT THE PERSON WHO WAS 
KILLED 
WELL IN THE LAST FEW FEW KILLED MINUTESEDF ELECTRICITY THE COMPANY 
THAT RUNS THIS SUBSTATION HAVE 
ISSUED A STATEMENT THEY SAY 
THEY'VE BEEN TOLD BY THE EMERGENCY 
SERVICES THAT THE EMERGENCY 
SERVICES BELIEVE THE DEAD PERSON 
WAS ONE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES THEY 
WON'T SAY MORE AT THIS STAGE OTHER 
THAN TO SAY THEY'RE PASSING THEIR 
CONDOLENCES ON TO THE FAMILY 
CONCERNED AND THEY WILL LAUNCH 
THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION BUT AT THE 
MOMENT INVESTIGATORS FROM THE 
HEALTH AND SAFETY EXECUTIVE ARE 
HERE HAVING A GOOD LOOK TO TRY AND 
FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 
BIGGER PICTURE THERE ARE STILL MANY 
PLACES IN IN CHELMSFORD TONIGHT 
WITHOUT POWER ABOUT TWO THOUSAND ODD 
CUSTOMERS WE BELIEVE ARE STILL 
WITHOUT POWER AND E. D. F. SAY IT MAY 
TAKE SOMETIME BEFORE THEY ARE 
RECONNECTED THERE WAS ALSO 
TRAVEL CHAOS IN 
CHELMSFORD TODAY BECAUSE MANY OF 
THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS IN THE CENTRE OF 
THE TOWN FAILED AS WELL 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
YOU HAVE FINISHED YOUR MEAL AND 
COULDN'T QUITE MANAGE THAT LAST 
MOUTHFUL SO YOU THROW IT OUT IN 
IT GOES TO YOUR RECYCLING BIN AND 
FOR MANY OF US THAT IS THE LAST WE 
THINK OF IT BUT HAVE YOU WONDERED 
WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR FOOD WASTE 
ONCE IT LEAVES YOUR DOORSTEP KARL 
MERCER HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THE 
LEFTOVERS FROM EALING THEIR WAY TO 
A NEW LIFE 
THESE MEN ARE HARD AT IT EVERY 
MORNING IN EALING THE FOOD WASTE 
AS USUAL IS PILING UP FAST TONNES 
OF THE STUFF IS COLLECTED EACH WEEK 
AND THE NUMBERS ARE GROWING 
BUT THIS BIN ON THE END OF THEIR 
VAN ISN'T THE END OF THE JOURNEY 
FOR THE FOOD THAT THE PEOPLE'S QUIZ 
OF EALING HAVE PEOPLE THAT THE 
GOOD PEOPLE OF EALING HAVE THROWN 
OUT NONE OF THE WASTE IS GOING TO 
WASTE WASTE THIS IS WHERE EALING'S FOOD WASTE 
ENDS UP EVERYTHING FROM ORANGE 
PEELS FISH HEADS THEY'RE ALL IN 
THERE FROM HERE IT'S TURNED NOT 
JUST INTO ELECTRICITY BUT INTO 
FERTILISER FOR THE FIELDS ON THE 
SURROUNDING FARMS THE IDEA IS 
SIMPLE ONE EALING THOUGH SO FAR 
THE ONLY BOROUGH IN LONDON TO TAKE 
IT UP FOR ALL ITS 
FOOD WASTE THE THE FOOD RECYCLING IS ONE OF THE KEY 
ELEMENTS OF OUR RECYCLING POLICY 
IT IS THE BEST MATERIAL WE CAN GET 
IN TERMS OF RECYCLING BUT ALSO WE 
HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT HOW WE DISPOSE 
OF THE RECYCLING IN THE MOST 
ENVIRONMENTLY FRIENDLY WAY 
THIS IS IT THIS IS WHAT YOUR 
THROWN OUT FOOD LOOKS LIKE AFTER THIRTY 
DAYS STORED IN GIANT TANK ALONG 
WITH PIG SLURRY PUBBLING AWAY AND 
MAKING METHANE GAS WHICH MAKES 
ENOUGH ELECTRICITY TO RUN ONE THOUSAND 
HOMES IT'S A PROCESS CALLED 
ANAROBIC DIGESTION THIS WHEAT IS 
BOOMING THANKS TO LEFTOVERS THIS THIS WORKS IN TWO WAYS FOR THE LOCAL 
AUTHORITY FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL 
POINT OF VIEW BUT AN ECONOMIC 
POINT OF VIEW AS WELL AS IT STANDS 
AT THE MOMENT THIS COMPETES VERY 
WELL WITH GOING TO LANDFILL IT'S 
ACTUALLY OFTEN A CHEAPER OPTION FOR 
THEM 
SO THE HUMBLE ROADSIDE THEM COLLECTIONS EVERY WEEK ARE DOING 
MORE THAN JUST KEEPING THE STREETS 
CLEAN THEY COULD HELP KEEP YOUR 
COUNCIL TAX DOWN AND DO THE BIT FOR 
THE ENVIRONMENT TOO

THAT WAS THE B. B. C. ROYAL 
CORRESPONDENT CORRESPONDENT IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THE EVENT IT 
IS ON B. B. C. TWO FROM EIGHT P. M. 
THE PARENTS OF AN EIGHT YEAR OLD 
BOY FROM KENT WHO DIED SUDDENLY 
HAVE ACCUSED THE LOCAL PARISH 
COUNCIL OF BLOCKING TACTICS 
PREVENTING THEM PUTTING UP A BAR 
SIMPSON HEADSTONE ON HIS GRAVE THE 
PARENTS SAY THE DECISION MEANS 
THEY WON'T HAVE A PERMANENT 
MEMORIAL TO MARK THE FIRST 
ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH 
CHARLIE WAS EIGHT WHEN HE DIED OF 
SUDDEN DEATH SYNDROME ASTUTE HE 
WAS A HUGE SIMPSON FAN BUT WHEN 
HIS PARENTS WANTED A TWENTY ONE IN STATUE 
OF THE CARTOON CHARACTER 
INCORPORATED ON HIS HEADSTONE THE 
PARISH COUNCIL SAID IT WOULD HAVE 
TO GO TO A VOTE 
I AM ANGRY THAT WE 
ARE HAVING TO GO THROUGH ALL OF 
THIS COMING UP TO THE ANNIVERSARY 
IT SHOULD BE BEING MADE WE WERE 
EXCITED WHEN WE CAME OUT OF THE 
STONEMASON HAVING GONE IN THERE 
HAVING TO DO SOMETHING HORRENDOUS 
CHOOSING YOUR SON'S HEADSTONE AND 
THINKING IT WAS PERFECT ACCORDING ACCORDING TO THE PARISH COUNCIL IT IS IN A 
DIFFICULT POSITION BECAUSE 
FOLLOWING A PUBLIC CONSULTATION 
THERE WAS OPPOSITION TO IT 
WE HAVE 
TO REMEMBER THIS IS CONSECRATED 
GROUND WE HAVE HAD TO CONSULT 
LOCALLY WITH THOSE PEOPLE TO TRY 
AND GET SOME VIEWS OF WHAT THEY 
THINK WERE BART SIMPSON IS 
ANYWHERE ELSE IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE 
APPROPRIATE FOR IT TO BE IN A 
CHURCHYARD 
BUT HIS FATHER SAYS IT CHURCHYARD IS A TASTEFUL AND FITTING TRIBUTE 
TO THEIR SON 
IT IS THE LAST THING 
I CAN POSSIBLY DO FOR HIM WHY 
CAN'T I HAVE IT IT IS NOT A CHURCH 
WELL THERE ARE NO RULES IF THERE 
ARE NO RULES WHY IS IT A PROBLEM 
THE FINAL DECISION WILL BE MADE BY 
PARISH COUNCILLORS WHO WILL VOTE ON 
THE ISSUE AT MEETING NEXT MONTH 
LONDON IS NOT SHORT OF LANDMARKS 
BUT THEY BE ECLIPSED BY NEW ONE 
PLAN FOR JUST OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL 
DEVELOPERS WANT TO BUILD SOUTHERN 
EQUIVALENT TO THE ANGEL OF THE 
NORTH SOME OF THE PROPOSALS ARE 
AND LITTLE UNCONVENTIONAL 
RIO GETS JESUS TO WATCH OVER IT 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY F. T. TALL SHIP TOWERING OVER THE 
CITY GATESHEAD GET TWO HUNDRED STEEL AND 
COPPER ANGEL KENT GETS BIG HORSE 
IN 
THE END IT IS A HORSE IN HORSE THE FIELD 
OR SOMETHING THAT LOOKS 
LIKE A SATELLITE DISH 
IT IS HUGE 
BUT NOT IMPRESSIVE 
OR A STEEL MAST 
OR ONE OF THESE WHICH WE WILL 
FIND OUT IN A FEW MONTHS AND BY 
TWO THOUSAND TEN IT ALSO BE STANDING TALL OF 
THE EBBSFLEET BARRY VALLEY THAT 
BUILDING THE CHANCES ARE IF YOU 
LIVE IN LONDON YOU WILL KNOW 
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS OUTSIDE LONDON 
MORE THAN A THIRD OF PEOPLE ASKED 
THOUGHT IT WAS SAINT PETER'S IN THE 
VATICAN BUT NEARLY ALL OF THEM 
INSTANTLY RECOGNISED THE END OF THE 
NORTH NOW THEY WANT ANOTHER 
LANDMARK WITH THE SAME MAGNITUDE 
DOWN IN THE SOUTH WHY NOT IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE CAPITAL WHERE ALL 
THESE PEOPLE CAN SEE IT EBBSFLEET EBBSFLEET WHERE IT WILL BE BUILT IT IS A 
DISUSED QUARRY NEXT TO A NEW 
RAILWAY STATION IT IS A NO 
WORKPLACE THE PEOPLE DEVELOPING IT 
NEEDS TO TURN IT INTO A SOME 
WORKPLACE 
FORTY MILLION PEOPLE EVERY WORKPLACE YEAR WOULD SEE IT WHEN IT IS 
INSTALLED IN THIS FIELD BY ROAD 
BECAUSE IT IS NEXT TO THE BUSY 
MOTORWAY BY RAIL BECAUSE THE 
EUROSTAR WILL GO PAST IT IS A 
WELCOME ADDITION TO THE PORTFOLIO 
OF MOVIE SETS BUT THE FILM MAKERS 
THEY SAY THEY WILL PROBABLY STICK 
TO THE CAPITAL 
LONDON HAS 
CONSTANTLY GOT NEW BUILDINGS 
MONUMENTS ARCHITECTURE BEING 
DEVELOPED ALL THE TIME THE STOCK WE 
ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A GIGANTIC 
BUILDING SITE THAT IS EAST LONDON 
NOW LEADING UP TO THE OLYMPICS IT 
IS FANTASTIC KENT HAS THAT BUT IT 
DOES NOT AFFECT THE PROMINENCE OF 
LONDON 
FOR SOME THE STATUES WOULD LONDON LOOK BETTER ON A SMALLER SCALE IN A 
GLASS CASE INDOORS BUT FOR THE 
PEOPLE OF KENT THERE WILL BE NO 
GETTING AWAY FROM THEM BUT WHICH 
ONE WE WILL HAVE TO SEE 
THERE HAS BEEN DISMAY AT THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT MORE THAN ONE IN 
FIVE POST OFFICES ARE TO CLOSE IN 
LONDON IT COMES AFTER A SIX WEEK 
PUBLIC CONSULTATION AND IT WILL 
MEAN BRANCHES CLOSING FROM NEXT 
MONTH THERE ARE SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT POST OFFICES 
IN THE CAPITAL ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE WILL CLOSE 
SEVEN OTHERS THREATENED WILL REMAIN 
OPEN OPEN THIS MAN HAS BEEN SUB POSTMASTER 
HERE IN WESTBOURNE FOR NEARLY TWENTY 
YEARS HE WOULD HOPE TO BE HERE FOR 
AT LEAST TWENTY MORE 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
I WILL BE DOING WILL I BE WITH THE 
POST OFFICE SOMEWHERE ELSE L. DO 
NOT KNOW L. AM VERY VERY 
DISAPPOINTED IT IS NOT NICE THE THE POST OFFICE IS IN A BUSY AREA OF 
NORTH WEST LONDON SITUATED ON THE 
HARROW ROAD AND THERE ARE TWO 
ESTATES EITHER SIDE AND A NEW CITY 
ACADEMY ACROSS THE SEATS STREET 
A PETITION WAS GATHERED AND 
CAMPAIGNERS SAY ITS CLOSURE WOULD 
BE A LOSS FOR LOCAL PEOPLE 
YOU TRY 
GOING TO THE BIG POST OFFICE THEY 
DON'T EXPLAIN WHAT THE DIFFERENT 
PAPERWORK IS AT LEAST HE WILL 
EXPLAIN IT TO YOU 
MOST OF THE TIME 
YOU HAVE TO QUEUE BECAUSE THERE ARE 
SO MANY PEOPLE USING IT 
IF THEY 
CLOSE THIS WE HAVE TO TRAVEL BY BUS 
WHEN YOU GET THERE THERE ARE QUEUES 
A MILE LONG 
WITH THE RISE OF THE 
INTERNET AND E. MAIL FEWER PEOPLE 
ARE USING POST OFFICES THEY ARE 
LOSING THOUSANDS OF POUNDS A DAY IN 
PROFITS AND CUTS ARE NEEDED SO 
ACCESS ACROSS THE COUNTRY CAN BE 
GUARANTEED 
SOME PEOPLE LIVE CLOSER GUARANTEED TO BRANCHES NOW IF WE CLOSE A 
BRANCH IT IS AN INCONVENIENCE 
OTHER PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THAT 
BENEFIT NOW THE WASTE WILL HAVE 
MORE BRANCHES THAN BANKS AND 
BUILDING SOCIETIES COMBINED 
TRAVELLING TO BUILDING SOCIETY IS 
IS A NONSENSE PEOPLE NEED TO GET 
TO THEIR OWN MONEY WE SEE BENEFITS 
THE LIST GOES ON IT IS BASICALLY 
THE MOST HONOURABLE IN SOCIETY WHO 
ONCE THOUGHT THE GOVERNMENT WAS 
SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTING 
WESTMINSTER CITY COUNCIL ARE STILL 
WAITING TO HEAR IF THEY CAN 
MAINTAIN POST OFFICE SERVICES IN 
THE BOROUGH BUT FOR THIS MAN 
ANYWHERE ELSE WON'T BE THE SAME 
THE FIRST CLOSURES IN LONDON WILL 
START NEXT MONTH 
A SINGER FROM THE BEE GEES IS 
HEADING A CAMPAIGN FOR A NATIONAL 
MEMORIAL IN LONDON IN MEMORY OF THE 
THOUSANDS WHO LOST THEIR LIVES 
DURING WORLD WAR TWO THESE ARE THE 
FORGOTTEN HEROES THE BOMBER 
COMMAND 
OVER HALF THE MEN WHO VOLUNTEERED 
FOR BOMBER COMMAND EITHER DIDN'T 
SURVIVE WERE WOUNDED OR WERE 
PRISONERS OF WAR THIS MAN WAS ONE 
OF THOSE WHOSE LANCASTER BOMBER 
FAILED TO RETURN 
AS SOON AS YOU 
GOT OVER THE WATER HE SAID WE'RE 
NOT GOING TO MAKE IT TURN ROUND 
THE NEXT THING WE KNEW THE PLANE 
BLEW UP L. WAS FALLING INTO SPACE 
THERE WERE SEARCHLIGHTS ALL AROUND 
THE IN SIXTY FIVE YEARS HE HAS NEVER BEEN 
BACK TO THE SITE OF THE CRASH WE 
DECIDED TO TAKE HIM BACK TO MEET 
THE PEOPLE WHO PIECED TOGETHER AS 
STORY OF THAT FINAL FATAL MISSION 
BLACK MAN IN OCCUPIED EUROPE WOULD 
HAVE FOUND ESCAPE IMPOSSIBLE HE 
RELIED ON DUTCH LOCALS TO ATTEND TO 
HIS WINS BEFORE HIS GERMAN CAPTORS 
SHOWED UP 
THERE YOU ARE COMING 
DOWN IN ENEMY TERRITORY AT NIGHT 
AND IN THE DISTANCE YOU CAN HEAR 
DOGS BARKING THE SENSATION WAS 
LIKE A BIG SHADOW SWALLOWING YOU 
IT WAS THE EARTH MY FEET LANDED ON 
THE GROUND AND I WAS RUNNING IN 
THAT DIRECTION 
AS AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD 
THIS MAN RACED ON HIS BICYCLE TO 
THE SCENE OF THE CRASH 
THERE WERE OVER ONE THOUSAND ENGINES 
NEVERTHELESS THESE BOMBERS PASSING 
OVERHEAD MEANT LIBERATION FOR THE 
DUTCH IT HAS LEFT AN ENDURING 
LEGACY OF GRATITUDE WHAT DOES IT 
MEAN TO YOU TO HAVE THIS MAN HERE 
AT HOME MANY BELIEVE THE DEPTH OF 
APPRECIATION FOUND IN HOLLAND IS 
MISSING HERE IN THE REMEMBRANCE OF 
BOMBER CREWS 
IT IS ABOUT SUPPORT 
AND RECOGNITION OF WHAT IS MORALLY 
RIGHT IT IS NOT ABOUT PEOPLE 
PUTTING THEIR HANDS IN HER POCKET 
IT IS ABOUT SAYING WE ON OF THESE 
BOYS THESE MEN WHO LOST THEIR 
LIVES AND WENT FREELY TO LAY DOWN 
THEIR LIVES 
MEETING SIXTY FIVE YEARS ON 
LIBERATOR AND LIBERATORS INSISTED 
IS THEIR DUTY TO REMIND US WHY SO 
MANY 
MEN FAILED TO RETURN YOUNG YOUNG MEN DIED FOR PEACE NOT FOR THE 
PERPETRATION OF WAR IN HOPE THERE 
WOULD BE NO MORE WAR IT SHOULDN'T 
BE A WAR MEMORIAL IT IS A PEACE 
MEMORIAL WE FOUGHT FOR PEACE 
WE HEARD ABOUT THE CITY SALUTE THIS 
EVENING PETER IS THERE NOW WITH 
THE WEATHER
