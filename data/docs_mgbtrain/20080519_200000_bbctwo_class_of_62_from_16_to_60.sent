THAT'S GREAT 
I'VE ORGANISED A REUNION FOR MY CLASSMATES IN LEEDS 
WE LEFT SCHOOL AT SIXTEEN IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO 
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT TO CATCH UP ON 
AND THAT'S ME YEAH AND THAT'S MARILYN IT'S NOT IT IS 
YOU'VE CHANGED YOUNGER THAN EVER 
ARE YOU A GRANDMOTHER 
I'VE GOT EIGHT GRANDCHILDREN AND TWO GREAT GRANDCHILDREN ON MY SECOND MARRIAGE 
ARE YOU OH YES 
WE'RE ALL SIXTY AND HAVE LIVED LIVES OUR WORKING CLASS MUMS COULD ONLY HAVE DREAMT OF 
WITH A SIGN TATTOOED ACROSS HER FOREHEAD I'M AVAILABLE 
AND IT IS AMAZING COS NOBODY'S DEAD 
AND AFTER ALL WE ARE GETTING ON A BIT 
I FIRST FILMED MY OLD CLASSMATES AT A REUNION BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE 
IT WAS TO BE THE START OF A TWENTY FIVE YEAR JOURNEY INTO THEIR LIVES' 
I REMEMBER YOU 
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MADE MY DREAMS COME TRUE 
A FEW KISSES AGO 
I REMEMBER YOU 
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID I LOVE YOU TOO 
YES I DO DIDN'T YOU KNOW 
I REMEMBERED MY OLD SCHOOLFRIENDS AS GIDDY SCHOOLGIRLS 
CLEVER ENOUGH TO TAKE GCES BUT NOT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE LOCAL GRAMMAR 
WE WERE THE GENERATION THAT WAS TO LIVE THROUGH THE START OF WOMEN'S LIBERATION 
THE FREEDOMS OF THE PILL AND THE TEENAGE REVOLUTION OF THE SIXTIES 
TODAY WE'RE ALL PUSHING FORTY AND I WONDERED HOW THEY FELT ABOUT THEMSELVES 
AS THE LOOKED BACK ON THEIR LIVES' 
WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO SAY TO YOU MARILYN WAS IN FACT 
THEY'RE GANGING UP PRACTICALLY LIKE THEY WERE WHEN THEY WERE AT SCHOOL 
I DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF AS A LIBERATED WOMAN 
I'VE NEVER FOUND IT NECESSARY TO BE LIBERATED 
IF I CAN HAVE EVERYTHING THAT I WANT GIVEN TO ME WITH GOOD FEELING 
WHERE'S THE POINT OF HAVING TO TAKE IT AND GRAB IT 
I WOULD SAY IN ALL HONESTY THAT MY LIFE IS A VERY TRAVELLED PATH 
THINGS DIDN'T COME TOO WELL FOR ME WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN 
THE SAME WEEK THAT MY GCES CAME UP MY GRANDFATHER DIED 
MY FATHER LEFT HOME AFTER BEING MARRIED TWENTY ONE YEARS TO MY MOTHER 
IN THE NOVEMBER SLASH DECEMBER I HAD THIS FACIAL STROKE 
WHICH ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED MY FACE FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS 
UP TO THAT TIME I'D HAD LOTS OF BOYFRIENDS SORT OF NO INSECURITY 
THEN YOU FIND YOURSELF LOOKING LIKE THAT AND YOU THINK 
OH GOD NOBODY'S GONNA WANT ME LOOKING LIKE THAT 
I HAD A BOYFRIEND WHO WAS OLDER AND WAS VERY VERY KIND TO ME 
DURING THAT TIME AND SO I JUST UPPED AND MARRIED HIM 
JUST UPPED AND MARRIED HIM AS SIMPLE AS THAT 
AND I WAS SORT OF QUIETLY REGRETTING IT FROM SQUARE ONE 
BY THE TIME KATY WAS TWENTY ONE SHE WAS A DIVORCEE WITH TWO CHILDREN 
I WAS SORT OF ON MY OWN FOR A WHILE JUST LOOKING AFTER THEM BASICALLY 
AND THEN JUST ONE DAY OUT OF THE BLUE NORMAN CAME ALONG 
MY MARRIAGE NOW IS DIFFERENT ENTIRELY FROM WHEN I WAS MARRIED BEFORE 
NORMAN ADOPTED THE CHILDREN 
WELL THEY WERE BABIES AT THE TIME JUST BABIES 
AND HE'S BEEN A PERFECT FATHER 
I WOULD SAY THAT WE'VE BUILT UP SORT OF A PARTNERSHIP OVER THE YEARS 
EVEN SO MARRIAGE IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT IT'S A FIFTY FIFTY THING 
IF YOU'RE FIFTY ONE PER CENT HAPPY STICK TO IT 
IF YOU'RE FORTY NINE PER CENT HAPPY RETHINK 
I WOULDN'T SAY I'M ONE HUNDRED PER CENT HAPPY 
I CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING I WANT AND WE FIGHT LIKE FIENDS 
BUT WE'RE DEFINITELY WELL OVER THE FIFTY PER CENT MARK SO WE STICK TOGETHER 
BUT IF WE WEREN'T I WOULDN'T HAVE IT 
I CAN SURVIVE COMPLETELY ON MY OWN IF I HAVE TO 
I THINK I'M A SURVIVOR REALLY 
WELL WE'RE STILL RUNNING OUR OWN BUSINESS AFTER TWELVE YEARS 
AND PEOPLE HAVE SAID TO US FOR YEARS 
YOU'RE MAKING SUCH A SUCCESS WHY DON'T YOU HAVE ANOTHER FRANCHISE IT DO A CHAIN 
THE ONLY BENEFIT I WOULD GET OUT OF HAVING EXTRA BUSINESSES FLOATING AROUND 
IS I COULD SIT HERE AND I COULD SAY TO YOU 
OH MARILYN MARILYN 
WE'VE GOT THIS AND WE'VE GOT THAT AND WE'VE GOT THE OTHER 
BUT SOMEONE POOR NORMAN FOR INSTANCE WOULD HAVE THE HEADACHE 
OF HAVING TO RUN IT SORT IT OUT AND LOOK AFTER IT 
IF YOU'VE GOT ONE THING AND YOU DO IT PROPERLY IT'S GOTTA BE EASIER HASN'T IT 
JOANNE'S FINALLY GETTING MARRIED 
OH ON THE TOP THIS IS IT NO IT WON'T 
AT THE MOMENT IT'S A BIT RATTY BUT WE'LL SOON SORT THAT OUT 
JOANNE'S TWENTY EIGHT NOW SO IT'S ABOUT TIME SHE WENT REALLY 
WELL IT'S A LONG TIME PAST 
MAM YOU HAVE THIS ONE HERE 
I CAN'T FIND MY TIGHTS CHRIST I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE DONE WITH THEM 
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY HUSBAND HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY 
WE NEVER HAD ANY TIME TO OURSELVES AT ALL UNTIL JOANNE WENT OUT WITH JOHN BECAUSE SHE WAS ALWAYS AT HOME 
SHE WAS VERY MUCH A HOMEBODY AND SO WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS TO GO OUT ON OUR OWN TOGETHER 
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER WE WERE GONNA GET ALONG TOGETHER 
IT FELT RIGHT FUNNY JUST THERE BEING THE TWO OF US NO ONE ELSE THERE 
KATHLEEN KATHLEEN WHAT 
CAN YOU JUST FASTEN ME THIS I'M ALL RIGHT THEN 
OH GOD ONE NEEDED THAT RIGHT O. K. 
JUST THAT AND OH COME ON 
SOUND AS A POUND THEN SOUND AS A POUND 
I THINK AT THAT POINT IN LIFE THIS IS WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE SPLIT UP 
BECAUSE THEY SUDDENLY GET TOGETHER AND THEY FIND THAT HECK WHO IS THIS PERSON 
I DON'T KNOW THIS PERSON AND I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE 'EM 
BUT WE'VE FOUND YEAH WE DO GET ALONG WELL WITH EACH OTHER 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT YOU 
THAT'S GREAT WELL IF YOU WEREN'T ALREADY MARRIED 
I'D MARRY YOU MYSELF THANKS GET WED NOW 
WHERE'S MY BAG WHERE AM I GOING THIS WAY 
THANK GOD ONE DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THIS I TELL YOU WHAT YEAH 
IT'S AN AWFUL LOT EASIER JUST TO GO TO THE REGISTER OFFICE AND HAVE A SIMPLE WEDDING 
OR IF YOU'VE GOT SOME SPARE CASH I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU TELL YOUR KIDS 
TO GO AND GET MARRIED IN A WEDDING CHAPEL IN LAS VEGAS 
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S PREFERABLE TO ALL THIS I DO 
OUR LITTLE WEDDING OH HE'S HERE IS T'OLD MAN 
COME HERE LOOK AT YA YOU'RE LIKE A BAG OF RAGS SORT YOU OUT 
I'VE BEEN RUNNING UP AND DOWN LIKE A BLUE ARSED FLY 
BUT OUR WEDDING WAS SO SIMPLE WASN'T IT YEAH SO EASY YEAH 
ISN'T THIS A NIGHTMARE A NIGHTMARE 
TELL ME ABOUT IT 
I'M TOLD ALL MEN MOAN WHEN THERE'S A WEDDING COMING UP 
BUT GOD HE REALLY RUINS THE ACT HE REALLY DOES WITH HIS 
ARMS AND LEGS ARE DROPPING OFF WITH THE EXPENSE YOU KNOW 
I KEEP EXPECTING HIM TO GO LIKE THIS YOU KNOW 
IT'S AWFUL ISN'T IT SWEATING AS WELL 
SWEATING THAT'S YOUR AGE YOU'RE BE GOING INTO T'MENOPAUSE CAN'T BE HELPED NO 
HE CAN BE A MOANING OLD BEGGAR BUT HE'S 
I WOULDN'T SWAP HIM 
NO NO HE'S GRAND 
HE'S JUST LIKE T'ROCK OF GIBRALTAR 
I DON'T HONESTLY HAVE A CLUE WHAT I WOULD DO IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO HIM 
WONDERFUL 
NOT TOO LONG AFTER JOANNE GOT MARRIED NORMAN GOT THROAT CANCER 
NO ONE COULD BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING COULD TOUCH HIM 
HE WERE PRACTICALLY INVINCIBLE 
AND THEN HE FOUND 
SOMETHING HAD COME UP ON HIS BACK 
IT WAS MELANOMA AND THAT WAS THE START OF IT IT WAS ABSOLUTE HELL 
HE MUST HAVE HAD PROBABLY TWENTY OPERATIONS ALL IN ALL 
LUMPS COMING UP HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE TAKING THEM AWAY 
THINGS GOING WRONG OPERATIONS GOING WRONG 
HE WAS SO NEEDY OF ME 
IT'S AWFUL TO SAY IN A WAY I QUITE ENJOYED THAT 
BECAUSE HE'D NEVER BEEN NEEDY OF ME BEFORE I WAS ALWAYS 
HE WAS ALWAYS SO STRONG AND LOOKED AFTER ME AND I WAS ALWAYS WEAKER 
AND FOR SIX YEARS I WASN'T A WIFE I WAS MORE OF A MOTHER 
AND THEN THEY DIE AND YOU THINK OH 
AND IT JUST ABSOLUTELY HITS YOU LIKE A BRICK THAT YOU'RE ALONE 
WHEN YOU BECOME A WIDOW YOU DIE 
YOU DIE ALONG WITH THEM THEY DIE YOU DIE 
AND IT TOOK ME I WOULD SAY 
PROBABLY THREE MONTHS TO STOP ABSOLUTE DREADFUL GRIEVING 
I FELT LIKE I WAS BEING PENALISED YOU KNOW 
I MEAN I KNOW THAT IT'S A SELFISH THING 
BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THERE WILL BE PROBABLY NEARLY EVERY WIDOW THAT HAS EVER BEEN MADE A WIDOW 
IS IN THAT POSITION WHERE THEY FEEL AT TIMES WHERE ARE YOU WHEN I NEED YOU 
THE PLUG NEEDS CHANGING THIS NEEDS DOING 
AND ALSO WHERE'S THE HAND TO HOLD 
ONLY YOU 
CAN MAKE THIS WORLD SEEM RIGHT 
ONLY YOU 
CAN MAKE THE DARKNESS BRIGHT 
ONLY YOU AND YOU ALONE 
DON'T ANYBODY THINK TO PITY ME 
DON'T EVER DO THAT BECAUSE I HAVE LOST MY HUSBAND WHO I CARED ABOUT 
HE WAS A LOVELY BLOKE AND I CARED ABOUT HIM AND I HAD HIM FOR MANY YEARS 
BUT I CONSIDER MYSELF ONE OF THE MOST FORTUNATE WOMEN ON EARTH 
BECAUSE I'VE GOT ANOTHER ONE JUST AS GOOD THERE IS 
BOTH BOTH MEN ARE WONDERFUL 
ONE WAS WONDERFUL ONE IS WONDERFUL 
AND THEY LOVED AND CARED FOR ME 
AND WHAT MORE CAN YOU WANT 
HOW MANY WOMEN CAN SAY THAT 
HE JUST TREATS ME LIKE A QUEEN AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT 
HE HAS HIS MOMENTS 
HE'S EIGHT YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME 
HE WAS FORTY NINE WHEN WE GOT TOGETHER AND I WAS SORT OF EARLY FIFTIES 
AND IT WAS BETTER 
IN MY HEAD IT'S BETTER BECAUSE IF I'VE GOT A MAN WHO'S OLDER 
AND I'M HAVING TO LOOK AFTER HIM 
IT MEANS A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME FOR US TO HAVE SOME FUN 
I WANNA GO OUT I WANT TO DO THINGS AND I'M GONNA GROW OLD DISGRACEFULLY 
I AIN'T GOT A LOT OF CHOICE WITH HIM ANYWAY HAVE I 
CARNATIONS HE'S GOT THIS THING ABOUT CARNATIONS HAS KEITH 
YEAH ROSES SAY I LOVE YOU 
CARNATIONS SAY I WANT YOU 
JUST GET HOME 
COS HE'S YOUNGER THAN ME I HOPE THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE 
IN THE SITUATION WHERE I'M GONNA FIND MYSELF ALONE AGAIN I DON'T 
I I DON'T THINK I CAN HANDLE THAT 
KEITH 
WITHOUT A GOOD MAN YOU MIGHT AS WELL FORGET IT 
UNLESS YOU'RE GONNA DO IT ON YOUR OWN 
IF YOU CAN DO IT ON YOUR OWN IF YOU'VE GOT THAT THAT'S FANTASTIC 
KATY SOLD HER RESTAURANT IN LEEDS TO HER DAUGHTER AND SON IN LAW 
IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR SHE BOUGHT A RUIN IN ITALY 
WHICH KEITH WHO'S A BUILDER IS RENOVATING 
OVER A COUPLE OF YEARS HE'S GRADUALLY GOT THIS PLACE 
FROM JUST A LITTLE RUIN INTO THIS 
BY THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR HE'LL HAVE THE POOL DONE PROBABLY BY JULY 
WE'LL BE THREE METRES LONG 
M. M. M. HE DESPERATELY WANTS TO GET MARRIED 
AND HE DOESN'T WANNA GET MARRIED UNTIL THE POOL'S COMPLETE 
COS HE'S GOT THIS THING ABOUT GETTING MARRIED 
AND THEN THROWING ME IN THE POOL AND I THINK HE MEANS TO JUMP IN AS WELL 
SHIT 
NOT THERE 
BUILDERS WORK VERY HARD 
BUT BUILDERS' MATES TEND TO WORK EVEN HARDER 
BECAUSE THEY GET THE RUBBISH JOBS AND THE RUBBISH JOBS TEND TO BE HEAVY 
WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG YOU TAKE EVERYTHING FOR GRANTED 
YOU TAKE YOUR YOUTH FOR GRANTED AND YOUR HEALTH 
AND WHEN YOU'RE OLDER YOU TREAT IT AS A GIFT 
NOW I CONSIDER THAT I'VE BEEN GIVEN A GIFT 
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE AS FIT AS I AM 
AND IT'S ALSO A GIFT TO FIND LOVE AGAIN AFTER YOU'RE IN A SITUATION 
WHERE YOU REALLY WOULD LIKE TO PUT YOUR HEAD IN THE OVEN 
IT'S NOT CLEVER TO SIT IN THE DOLDRUMS AND THINK 
I AM DEAD MEAT 
I'M GONNA ENJOY MYSELF WHILE I'VE GOT THE CHANCE 
I'M GOING TO HAVE FUN 
HE'S THE SORT OF BLOKE WHO IS DEFINITELY GOING TO HELP ME HAVE FUN 
FOR ME TURNING SIXTY IS DEFINITELY NOT AN END IT'S ABSOLUTELY A BEGINNING 
GREAT BLOKE NEW PLACE OUT OF THE RAT RACE EVERYTHING THAT I WANT 
BACK IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO GILLIAN HAD DREAMED OF BEING A SCHOOLTEACHER 
LIKE HER BROTHERS 
BUT HER FATHER DIDN'T BELIEVE IN CAREER GIRLS 
AND MADE HER LEAVE SCHOOL BEFORE HER FINAL EXAMS 
SHE'D SPENT HER LIFE DOING KITCHEN AND CLEANING WORK 
AND BY NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WAS AN UNEMPLOYED DIVORCEE WITH TWO CHILDREN 
OH I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU'RE WASHING UP 
I'VE BEEN DIVORCED FIVE YEARS 
AND BRINGING THE TWO OF THEM UP ON MY OWN IS NOT EASY 
SUZANNE'S THIRTEEN ANDREW'S TWELVE 
BUT THE ONE THING THAT I AM DOING IS MAKING THEM BOTH EQUAL 
WHAT ONE WILL DO THE OTHER ONE WILL DO AS REGARDS WASHING UP HOUSEWORK OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
WHAT YOU EXPECT A GIRL TO DO YOU KNOW HE HAS TO DO IT 
I'M NOT TOO KEEN ON HIS IRONING HE DOESN'T IRON MUCH 
DID YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE WITH THE BUSES TODAY 
NO I'VE GOT SOME HOMEWORK 
AT THE MOMENT MY PURPOSE IN LIFE IS TO MAKE IT WORK FOR THEM 
I CAN GIVE THEM THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE WHETHER TO GO TO UNIVERSITY AND TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO 
HAVE YOU GOT ANY HOMEWORK YET ANDREW 
AS SOON AS YOU'VE DONE YOUR PAPER ROUND YOU CAN DO THAT 
AND DON'T FORGET 
AND ONCE THEY HAVE FINISHED THAT THEN I CAN START 
GOING TO COLLEGE BE A MATURE STUDENT 
MOST NIGHTS IS AT HOME WITH THE CHILDREN WITH MILLS AND BOONS OR MY KNITTING 
I WOULD NOT LIKE TO GO WITHOUT MY MILLS AND BOONS BEING DELIVERED 
IT'S A BIT OF ROMANCE IN MY LIFE 
YOU GET TWELVE EACH MONTH YOU KNOW AND IT KEEPS YOU GOING 
ALL THE MEN ARE DIFFERENT IN THE ROMANCES 
YOU KNOW TALL DARK SOME HAVE A BEARD SOME HAVE A MOUSTACHE 
AND IT'S LIKE HAVING A NEW MAN EVERY NIGHT YOU GO TO BED 
YOU'RE LIVING IN A DREAM WORLD ALL THE TIME WITH THOSE 
YOU HAD DREAMS 
YOU STILL HAVE DREAMS TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT AND THEN 
WHAT'S THE POINT IN DREAMING NOTHING EVER COMES OF IT 
BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO GET THEM THERE 
TO COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY SO THEN THEY COULD HAVE A CHANCE 
WHICH THEY EVIDENTLY DIDN'T WANT 
ANDREW GOT MARRIED LAST YEAR AND THEY'VE GOT TWO CHILDREN 
AND SUZIE IS AN UNMARRIED MOTHER AND HAS GOT KIERAN WHO'S THREE 
FOR THE PAST FOUR MONTHS GILLIAN HAS BEEN HER GRANDSON KIERAN'S GUARDIAN AND FULL TIME CARER 
I'VE GOT A CLEANING JOB AT THE CHURCH 
THE PLAYSCHOOL IS AT THE CHURCH 
SO HE'S USED TO GOING TO THE CHURCH HALL AND HE'S QUITE HAPPY REALLY 
MY FURTHER EDUCATION HAS BEEN PUT ON HOLD AGAIN' 
IF I'VE GOT FAMILY PROBLEMS 
I DON'T THINK I CAN GIVE IT MY BEST SHOT AT NIGHT SCHOOL 
AND SO EVERY TIME SOMETHING HAPPENS LIKE THAT 
I I TEND TO JUST STOP GOING 
AND THEN THIS THING WITH SUZIE BLEW UP AND SO I DIDN'T GO ON WITH IT 
THERE'S MUMMY MUM MUM 
SHE HAD A CHILDMINDER TO LOOK AFTER KIERAN 
AND THINGS GOT A BIT OUT OF HAND AND KIERAN WAS TAKEN INTO CARE 
THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DON'T REALLY WANT TO GO INTO BECAUSE THEY DON'T CONCERN ANYBODY ELSE 
IT IS ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT HE WAS IN CARE UNFORTUNATELY 
ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED IN SUZIE IN THIS MATTER 
CUT 
WE DISCOVERED THAT UNDER THE CHILDREN'S ACT GRANDPARENTS CAN APPLY FOR A RESIDENCE ORDER 
SO THAT KIERAN COULD COME AND LIVE WITH ME 
SO THAT'S WHAT WE DID 
A RIGHT LOT 
ARE YOU GONNA TAKE THOSE IN ME YEAH TAKE THEM TO MUMMY 
INITIALLY SHE HAD TO BE SUPERVISED WITH HIM 
AND IS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE FOR HIM TO TO PUT HIM TO BED 
COME ON SHOW ME WHAT A BIG BOY YOU ARE 
BUT I INSIST THAT SHE GOES HOME AT NIGHT 
A MESS REALLY 
IT IS A MESS IT IS A MESS YEAH 
I FEEL AS THOUGH I'VE FAILED HER IN SOME WAY AND FAILED HIM 
I FEEL AS THOUGH IT IS MY FAULT 
ARGHH ARGHH 
BUT I'VE ACTUALLY DONE SOMETHING ABOUT IT TO CHANGE THE SITUATION 
ARE YOU GOING SWIMMING NOW 
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO DO IT YOU KNOW 
TO SET MY STALL UP AND GO AND FIGHT FOR HIM 
MOST PEOPLE THINK I'M AN IDIOT APPROACHING FIFTY AND TAKING ON A THREE YEAR OLD 
BUT WHEN HE WAKES UP IN THE MORNING THE SMILE THAT HE GIVES YOU IT'S WORTH IT 
HE'S JUST LOVELY 
HE'S THE LATE CHILD I NEVER HAD 
GIVE US A KISS 
SEE YOU LATER BYE BYE BE GOOD 
BLOOD'S THICKER THAN WATER IN THE END 
AND IF HE DOES GO BACK TO HIS MUM WHICH HE COULD DO 
BEING SIXTY IS A TURNING POINT IN YOUR LIFE 
I DON'T HAVE TO WORK ANY MORE IF I DON'T WANT TO 
I WAS REALLY CHUFFED COS I NEVER THOUGHT I'D GET THERE 
ALL OF A SUDDEN I CAN HAVE A BUS PASS AND GO WHERE I WANT IN IN WEST YORKSHIRE 
I THOUGHT IT WAS LOVELY 
GET OUT AND GO WHERE I WANT TO GO 
I WENT TO SALTAIRE BINGLEY OTLEY 
ALTHOUGH THEY'RE ONLY NEAR BUT IT'S SOMETHING I HAVEN'T DONE FOR A LONG TIME 
I WOULDN'T GO ANYWHERE SOMETIMES UNLESS SOMEBODY ELSE WAS GOING 
BUT NO I THINK I CAN DO IT BY MYSELF 
SO MUCH SO I'M EVEN THINKING OF GOING ON MY HOLIDAY ON MY OWN YEAH 
I DON'T SEE MUCH OF MY SON OR MY GRANDDAUGHTERS 
BUT I STILL SEE KIERAN AND SUZIE 
KIERAN WILL BE FIFTEEN IN OCTOBER AND HE DID GO BACK TO HIS MUM 
WHEN HE FINALLY WENT BACK 
THE ODD NIGHTS I DID FEEL LONELY 
BECAUSE I WASN'T HAVING TO PUT HIM TO BED BUT I COULD HAVE A LONGER SLEEP 
I DIDN'T HAVE TO GET UP SO EARLY 
KID'S CHICKEN NUGGETS THAT ONE 
SUZIE HAD ANOTHER BABY SEVEN YEARS AGO AND IT WAS ANOTHER BOY JORDAN 
SUZIE DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY SHE'S NEVER WORKED SO SOMETIMES I GO OUT AND TREAT THEM 
USUALLY IT'S BIRTHDAYS AND THAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IT A FAMILY AFFAIR 
I CAN'T REMEMBER COMING WITH GRANDDAD 
I KNOW I'VE BEEN HERE A FEW TIMES WITH YOU 
I'VE BEEN HERE WITH GRANDDAD 
WE USED TO MEET HIM ON A FRIDAY SOMETIMES OH RIGHT 
WHEN HE WAS COMING TO TOWN 
WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IN THE FUTURE IS ALL THE GRANDKIDS WITH JOBS' 
KIERAN WOULD LIKE TO GO INTO THE ARMY OR TO GO INTO IT 
BUT HE CAN HE CAN DO BOTH IF HE GOES IN THE ARMY 
I WOULD BE ANXIOUS FOR HIM BUT THEN YOU CAN'T STOP THEM WHAT THEY WANT TO DO 
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH SUZIE IS A LOT BETTER 
SHE EVEN GIVES ME A KISS WHEN SHE LEAVES ME NOW YOU KNOW 
I MIGHT GET FRUSTRATED AT TIMES 
BUT I DIDN'T WANT THE SAME RELATIONSHIP WITH SUZIE I HAVE WITH MY MOTHER 
AND THAT IS A CONSCIOUS DECISION THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE 
SINCE I LAST FILMED WITH GILLIAN IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE 
HER MOTHER HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY FRAIL AND NEEDS HELP AT HOME 
OH I'M SAT ON OH MOTHER SAT ON SOMETHING HOW ARE YOU 
DYING SLOWLY 
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AFTER MY MOTHER FOR TEN YEARS SINCE NINETY SEVEN THEN 
TEN YEARS I'VE BEEN GOING OVER AND SLEEPING TWO NIGHTS A WEEK 
TEN YEARS TEN YEARS OF IT AND I BECAME OFFICIALLY MY MOTHER'S CARER 
EH YOU LOOK UNCOMFORTABLE 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT 
SIX FOOT FELLA EH 
VIRILE SIX FOOT FELLA VIRILE 
I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIM 
HE'D SHOW YOU 
WHEN SHE'S HOUSEBOUND IT'S A VERY HARD THING TO TO PUT UP WITH 
I HAVE TO KEEP EVERYTHING TO HAND SAVE ME GETTING UP BENDING MY KNEES 
WASHING ON EH WASHING 
OH YEAH WASHING THERE WON'T BE MUCH 
A JUMPER AND KNICKERS 
I'VE GOT TWO BROTHERS WHO COULD DO A LOT MORE AND WHO DON'T 
MY MOTHER ONCE TURNED ROUND AND SAID SHE'D ALWAYS WANTED A GIRL 
I'M SURE THEY ONLY WANTED A GIRL BECAUSE GIRLS AREN'T SUPPOSED TO HAVE CAREERS 
AND THAT ONE SHOULD STAY AT HOME AND LOOK AFTER THEIR OWN PEOPLE 
THE PARENTS WHEN THEY GROW OLD 
I DO LOVE MY MOTHER BUT I DO THINK SHE SAYS THE MOST HURTFUL THINGS 
THAT I HAVE LEFT THE HOUSE IN TEARS WHEN I'VE COME HOME 
SHE USUALLY SAYS PULL MY TROUSERS UP AND HER JUMPER DOWN 
AND SHE ALWAYS SAYS DON'T BE ROUGH WITH ME 
I THOUGHT I'VE NEVER BEEN ROUGH WITH HER IN MY LIFE 
AND I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT I GET DON'T BE ROUGH WITH ME 
BRAMLEY GREGOR'S THESE ARE 
BRAMLEY'S BRAMLEY 
I'M WORTHLESS ACCORDING TO MY MOTHER 
MY BROTHERS THEY'RE THE WORTHWHILE THINGS IN HER LIFE 
OH MAKING HER MOUTH WATER NOW 
I THOUGHT MORE OF HER WHEN MY DAD WAS ALIVE 
BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE WAS ON MY SIDE AS MUCH AS SHE COULD BE 
WHETHER SHE THOUGHT HE WAS THE PATRIARCH TO BE OBEYED ALL THE TIME 
I DON'T KNOW OR WHETHER SHE JUST WANTED AN EASY LIFE 
SHE COULD HAVE DONE A LOT MORE AND EVEN SUPPORT ME NOW 
AND SHE SHE DOESN'T I MEAN I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S IN A COUNCIL HOUSE 
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S NOT GOT A PROPER CAREER 
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS TO NURSE HER GO THROUGH AND NURSE HER 
NO JUSTICE IN THIS WORLD 
I FEEL AS A CHRISTIAN DUTY I SHOULD LOOK AFTER HER 
BUT IT DOESN'T ALTER THE FACT HOW I FEEL 
JUST A MINUTE LET ME GET OUT 
IF IT WAS THE OTHER WAY AROUND AND MY DAD WAS STILL ALIVE 
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN GOING OVER I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN GOING OVER NO 
NIGHT NIGHT OH NIGHT NIGHT 
YES I WISH I'D BELONGED TO A CARING FAMILY 
I WISH MY MUM AND DAD HAD BEEN LIKE YOUR MUM AND DAD 
I JUST WISH THEY'D BEEN MORE LOVING 
MY MOTHER WOULD LIKE ME TO GIVE UP MY HOUSE AND GO AND STAY THERE ALL THE TIME 
BUT WHEN SHE HAS PASSED ON THE HOUSE WILL HAVE TO BE SPLIT FOUR WAYS AND I'LL BE HOMELESS 
I DON'T INTEND TO DO THAT 
I STILL LIKE MY MILLS AND BOONS 
THEY ARE A GOOD WAY OF GETTING YOU TO SLEEP 
AND WHEN I'M AT MY MOTHER'S I DO NEED A BIT OF ROMANCE 
IT MUST BE THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN YEARS SINCE I LAST HAD A DATE 
I DON'T WANT A FELLA BUT IF ONE CAME ALONG I WOULDN'T MIND 
WHEN I FIRST GOT DIVORCED I THOROUGHLY THOUGHT THAT I WOULD BE MARRIED AGAIN WITHIN A FEW YEARS 
BUT THERE WAS NOWHERE TO GO AND MEET 'EM 
I MEAN THERE'S NO SINGLE MEN AT CHURCH 
SINGLE MEN DON'T GO UNLESS THEY'VE LOST THEIR WIVES AND THAT 
PLEASE 
WELL I WANT A NICE YOUNG MAN 
HE'S THE ONLY FELLA I CAN GET 
HEY DON'T BE LIKE THAT 
AND IT'S MY DAD NOW SHOULD BE THE BEST TIME IN MY LIFE 
IT WILL BE THE BEST TIME OF MY LIFE 
BECAUSE I SHALL BE DOING WHAT I WANT TO DO I AM SIXTY 
NOBODY WANTS ME ANY MORE 
BUT I AM WORTHWHILE 
AND I DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE NOW BUT YOU KNOW YOU DO REALLY 
I KNOW BUT I CAN SAY THAT 
NO 
DEFINITELY THE HAPPIEST TIME OF MY LIFE I THINK WILL BE NOW 
YOU KNOW I'M SIXTY 
I NEVER HAD MUCH OF A LIFE BEFORE I WANT ONE NOW 
AND YOU SHALL HAVE IT 
I SHALL HAVE IT I SHALL 
I SHALL HAVE IT YEAH 
RIGHT THAT ALL RIGHT 
TWENTY ONE TODAY 
WE'VE GOT THE KEY OF THE DOOR 
NEVER BEEN TWENTY ONE BEFORE 
BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE I'D FOUND OUT THAT DENISE HAD BEEN A BATTERED WIFE 
DIVORCED FROM HER VIOLENT HUSBAND 
SHE SURVIVED FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AS A SINGLE MOTHER 
RAISING HER THREE DAUGHTERS WITH THE HELP OF SOCIAL SECURITY 
OH SMASHING LOVE 
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A VERY GOOD MAN THAT I'D BE PREPARED TO TAKE ON AGAIN 
THEY'RE TOO MUCH TROUBLE AND BOTHER AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED 
I CAN RUN MY OWN LIFE I CAN COPE FINANCIALLY 
SO IF YOU'RE ALL RIGHT FINANCIALLY YOU DON'T REALLY NEED THEM 
UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL AT THE MOMENT 
YEAH WELL I MISS SEX 
I MEAN DON'T YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU'VE NO BLOKE THAT THAT IS THE MAIN CONSIDERATION 
M. M. M. I DO ANYWAY 
I MEAN I ENJOY SEX BUT IT DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT I GET A LOT OF IT 
I MEAN AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED I JUST DO WITHOUT AT THE MOMENT 
I HAVEN'T MET ANYBODY THAT I PARTICULARLY WANT TO GO TO BED WITH 
I MEAN IN THE NORTH THE MAN STILL EXPECTS TO BE BOSS 
THEY STILL EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT TO THE PUB WHEN HE WANTS 
WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A BY YOUR LEAVE 
THAT'S WHY I WON'T TAKE ON A MAN 
BECAUSE WITH THE ATTITUDES THEY'VE GOT I DON'T WANT TO KNOW 
I COULDN'T ACCEPT A MAN'S DICTUMS ON WHAT I SHOULD BE DOING 
IT'S EITHER A PARTNERSHIP OR IT'S NOTHING 
ON ITS OWN NUMBER NINE 
ON ITS OWN NUMBER THREE 
I'VE JUST TAKEN TWO GCE O. LEVEL EXAMINATIONS 
SOCIOLOGY AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE 
AND TO MY GREAT SURPRISE AND AMAZEMENT I'VE PASSED BOTH OF THEM 
I GOT A GRADE A IN MY ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND A GRADE B. IN SOCIOLOGY 
SO I'M OVER THE MOON ABOUT THAT 
IT MEANS THAT I'LL NOW GO ON AND TAKE MY A LEVELS 
AND MAYBE GO ON TO A TEACHING COURSE OR INTO SOCIAL WORK 
AND THEN MAYBE I WILL BE FREE OF SOCIAL SECURITY 
BE ABLE TO COCK A SNOOK AT THEM AND SAY WELL BYE BYE 
I'M ON MY OWN FROM NOW ON 
AND THANK GOD FOR IT 
I THINK I WANTED TO PROVE MYSELF 
I WANTED TO PROVE TO EVERYBODY AND ANYBODY 
THAT BELIEVED THAT WOMEN ON THEIR OWN WITH KIDS 
CCOULDN'T MAKE ANYTHING OF THEIR LIVES 
I WAS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND IN DEBT WHEN I GOT WORK 
AND IT TOOK ME TWO YEARS TO GET OUT OF THAT TRAP OF DEBT 
BUT MY WHOLE LIFE HAS ALTERED IN JUST TWELVE SHORT YEARS 
AND SOMETIMES I JUST THINK I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS 
MORNING STEPHEN MORNING DENISE 
I'VE HAD A LOT OF CHANGES 
A LOT OF THINGS HAVE HAPPENED TO ME 
I'VE PASSED MY DRIVING TEST I'VE BOUGHT MY HOUSE I'VE GOT A NEW JOB 
AND I'VE GOT PROMOTION IN MY JOB DURING THOSE TWELVE YEARS AS WELL 
AH GREAT STUFF RIGHT I'LL SEE YOU LATER SEE YOU LATER 
GOOD MORNING SOCIAL SERVICES 
THERE'S A BABY IN FOSTER CARE 
BUT I DID FIND THAT I WAS FINDING MYSELF VERY LONELY 
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY YOUR KIDS HAVE GOT THEIR OWN FAMILIES 
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP THEIR WEEKENDS 
BY VISITING ALL THE TIME AND SUCH LIKE 
I THINK I'D GIVEN UP ON FINDING ANYONE THAT WAS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR 
I DIDN'T THINK HE EXISTED REALLY 
HI LOVE HI 
'. I THOUGHT LOOK IN OTHER DIRECTIONS 
AND THEN I MET KEN AND MY PRIORITIES CHANGED 
WE JUST CLICKED EVERYTHING WE DO WE DISCUSS AND WE SORT IT OUT 
AND IF WE'VE GOT DIFFERENT IDEAS ON IT WE COMPROMISE 
IT'S THE PARTNERSHIP I WAS LOOKING FOR 
COS HE'S JUST A WONDERFUL MAN 
AND GOODNESS KNOWS WHERE I FOUND HIM BUT I HAVE 
WELL MY DAUGHTERS NOW ALL OF THEM ARE HAPPY FOR ME 
THERE WAS A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT IT WHEN WE FIRST MET 
THERE WAS THIS SHE'S STARTING A NEW LIFE AND WE WON'T FIGURE IN IT 
BUT KEN BEING KEN THEY'VE ACCEPTED HIM 
AS PART OF THE FAMILY AND THERE ISN'T A PROBLEM 
IT'S ALL WORKED OUT PRETTY WELL 
PLUS BETWEEN THEM THEY'VE GIVEN ME SEVEN GRANDCHILDREN 
WHICH I THINK IS WONDERFUL 
I SAYS GIVE US A CLOTH HE WENT HERE 
AS YOUR CHILDREN GROW UP YOU THINK OH WELL THIS IS MY TIME NOW 
AND I'VE GOT ALL MY LIFE AHEAD OF ME THAT I CAN DO WHAT I WANT WITH 
AND THEN YOU FIND THAT YOUR PARENTS START TO GET ILL 
OR THEY NEED LOOKING AFTER MORE 
AND YOU FIND YOURSELF BEING A PARENT TO YOUR PARENT 
YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY IN MY CASE COS MY MUM'S GOT ALZHEIMER'S 
AND IT'S JUST LIKE LOOKING AFTER A CHILD 
OR AT LEAST IT WAS WHEN SHE WAS AT HOME 
THE COMPANIONSHIP WAS WHAT I MISSED MORE THAN ANYTHING 
IT WAS LIKE IT HAD NEVER BEEN 
IT WAS REALLY STRANGE LIKE A BIG GAP IN MY LIFE 
THAT HAD JUST DISAPPEARED AND WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN 
AND THERE'S THE AWFUL FEELING THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE THERE AT ALL 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME NATURE COMPENSATES AND I FOUND KEN 
I FEEL THAT I'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT I'VE MISSED ALL MY LIFE REALLY 
AND I FEEL VERY LUCKY FOR THAT 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT 
I NEVER ANTICIPATED HAPPENING TO ME QUITE HONESTLY 
WE'VE BOTH GOT GOOD PRIVATE PENSIONS 
WE'VE BOTH GOT STATE PENSIONS SO LIFE IS A PLEASURE AT SIXTY 
YOU'VE NOT GOT THE RESTRICTIONS OF BOSSES AND PARENTS AND HUSBANDS 
MY HUSBAND DON'T BOSS ME SO I CAN SAY THAT WITH CONFIDENCE 
YEAH YOU'VE GOT THE FREEDOM TO DO WHAT YOU WANT 
AND I'M LUCKY IN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO DO IT AS WELL 
COS WITHOUT THE MONEY OF COURSE YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING 
IT'S ALL RIGHT SAYING THAT MONEY DOESN'T BRING HAPPINESS BUT IT HELPS 
WE'VE BEEN COMING TO GREECE NOW FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS AND WE LOVE IT 
LAST YEAR WE DECIDED THAT NOW WE'VE RETIRED 
THIS IS WHERE WE WANT TO LIVE 
WE PUT A DEPOSIT DOWN FOR A HOUSE THAT WAS BEING BUILT JUST OUTSIDE OF RHODA 
THE VILLAGE THAT WE LIKE TO VISIT 
WE'VE PUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND EUROS DOWN WHICH IS ABOUT TEN THOUSAND 
WHICH WE BORROWED FROM THE BANK 
WE'VE HAD THE ARCHITECT'S DRAWINGS DONE 
WE'D A SWIMMING POOL PLANNED IN THE GROUNDS 
SO WE COULD SPEND ALL OUR DAYS OUTSIDE 
WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE AT HOME ANY MORE 
THE PENSIONS JUST DO NOT STRETCH 
TO THE SORT OF MONEY THAT WE HAVE TO PAY OUT IN ENGLAND 
HERE WE CAN LIVE A LOT CHEAPER WE'VE GOT A NICE LIFESTYLE 
THE WEATHER'S GOOD PENSIONS STRETCH A LOT FURTHER 
EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS A BONUS 
BUT WE HOPE OF COURSE THAT WE'RE GONNA LIVE WELL INTO OUR NINETIES' 
AND BE LITTLE GREEK MAN AND WOMAN IN OUR LITTLE GREEK HOUSE 
THOROUGHLY BROWN AND THOROUGHLY ENJOYING LIFE UNTIL THE END 
TO PAY FOR THEIR PLACE IN THE SUN 
DENISE AND KEN HAVE ALREADY PUT THEIR TERRACED HOUSE IN LEEDS UP FOR SALE 
KEN AND I DECIDED TO MOVE TO GREECE 
BECAUSE WE'RE SICK OF THIS NANNY STATE 
I MEAN THERE'S THIS NO SMOKING AT THE MOMENT AND I HATE IT 
I HATE IT WITH A VENGEANCE 
THE INTOLERANCE IS JUST OVERWHELMING 
YOU GO TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND NO MATTER WHETHER YOU GO TO A RESTAURANT 
A BAR OR WHATEVER THERE'S SOMEONE ALWAYS AT THE DOOR ASKING YOU 
SMOKING MADAM OR NON SMOKING 
WHY THE HECK COULDN'T THEY HAVE DONE THAT HERE 
WHY IS IT THAT EVERYONE HAS TO BE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE 
IT'S LIKE SHEEP FOLLOWING SHEEP 
I MEAN BRITAIN WAS RENOWNED FOR BEING A COUNTRY 
OF FREE SPEECH FREEDOM LIBERTY 
WHERE'S IT ALL GONE 
SINCE WE LAST FILMED KEN AND I HAVE GOT MARRIED 
I ASKED KEN TO MARRY ME AND 
ON VALENTINE'S DAY AND HE SAID YES 
AND WE HAD A BIG CHURCH WEDDING 
COS MY FIRST MARRIAGE WAS A REGISTRY OFFICE DO 
AND I SAID IF I EVER GOT MARRIED AGAIN I WAS GONNA DO IT PROPERLY 
WE HAD THE MONEY SO WE WENT AHEAD 
NO NO YOU'LL SPILL IT DOWN MY THROAT 
IN THE SIXTIES WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT SORT OF MONEY 
PARENTS DIDN'T HAVE THAT SORT OF MONEY AND YOU COULDN'T ENVISAGE IT 
MOST PEOPLE THAT I KNEW CAME FROM COUNCIL HOUSES AND WE DIDN'T HAVE CARS 
AND WE DIDN'T GET OUR FIRST TELEVISION WHILE I WAS TWELVE YEAR OLD 
I MEAN WE NEVER EVEN DREAMT THAT WE'D GO ABROAD 
YOU WERE LUCKY IF YOU GOT A WEEK AT SCARBOROUGH 
I MEAN TO JUMP FROM THAT TO GOING TO LIVE ABROAD 
AND BUYING A HOUSE ABROAD IT'S LIKE A FAIRYTALE REALLY 
I THINK I'LL BE BOUND TO MISS THE CHILDREN THEY HAVE BEEN MY LIFE 
I STILL THINK THAT I WILL STILL SEE A LOT OF THEM 
BECAUSE IT'LL BE FREE HOLIDAYS SO THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO KEEP AWAY 
JULIE MY ELDEST DAUGHTER A FEW YEARS AGO SHE CAME TO ME 
AND TOLD ME THAT IN ACTUAL FACT SHE WAS GAY 
AND SHE'D FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO TELL ME 
I JUST SAID THAT'S FINE LOVE GIVE US A HUG 
AND SHE BURST INTO TEARS COS SHE'D BEEN SO AFRAID OF TELLING ME 
AND WHAT MY REACTION MIGHT BE 
IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME AS LONG AS THEY'RE HAPPY 
SO SHE'S RUNNING A PUB NOW WITH HER PARTNER WHO IS CLAIRE 
JULIE WAS TELLING ME THAT THEY'VE GOT A GREAT DEAL OF SUPPORT FROM THE VILLAGE THAT THEY'RE IN 
THEY'RE ALL AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THEY ARE A GAY COUPLE 
AND THEY'RE ALL QUITE HAPPY ABOUT IT 
SHE SAYS YOU DO GET THE ODD PERSON 
THAT IF YOU'VE TO THROW THEM OUT OF THE PUB THEN THEY MAKE SOME SORT OF COMMENT 
YOU KNOW REGARDING THEM BEING LESBIAN AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING 
SHE SAID BUT YOU EXPECT THAT COS THAT'S 
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN SORT OF GET BACK AT YOU 
THAT'S NICE THE THEME'S GONNA BE PINK AND WHITE 
YEAH ALL GIRLIE RIGHT 
THEY'RE GETTING MARRIED IN SEPTEMBER CIVIL CEREMONY 
WE'RE ALL GOING TO THE WEDDING 
AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO 
WE'RE GOING TO MANCHESTER FOR A NIGHT OUT THERE'S FORTY EIGHT OF US 
OH I'M GLAD I'M NOT GOING ON A BUS SO GOOD LUCK MANCHESTER 
ALL RIGHT THEN WE'LL SEE YOU IN A FORTNIGHT ALL RIGHT 
DON'T FORGET TO DROP THEM INVITES OFF WILL YOU BYE 
DENISE AND KEN'S HOUSE HAS BEEN ON THE MARKET FOR ALMOST A YEAR 
THEY'RE TAKING A LONG PLANNED TRIP TO CORFU 
TO CHECK ON THE PROGRESS OF THEIR LUXURY VILLA 
MY WINTER CARDIE 
YEAH DON'T FORGET THAT IT COULD BE COLD IN THE NIGHT 
SELLING THE HOUSE HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE 
WE DID GET ONE RIDICULOUS OFFER OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THERE WAS NO WAY WE WERE GONNA TAKE THAT 
AND IN ANY CASE WE HAD TO GET A CERTAIN LEVEL FOR THIS HOUSE 
IN ORDER TO MAKE THE DREAM COME TRUE 
UNFORTUNATELY THE GREEK END THEY'RE NEEDING THEIR MONEY 
YEAH JUST LOOK AT THAT EH OH 
WE'VE BECOME GOOD FRIENDS WITH THE PROPERTY DEVELOPER 
HE'S CALLED MICHAELIS O. K. YEAH 
WELL DEPRESSED BUT O. K. YEAH YEAH 
WE GO DOWN AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT OF COURSE O. K. 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE'VE GOT TO PAY THE BANK BACK AT THE MOMENT 
THE DEPOSIT WE PAID YOU WE HAVE TO PAY THAT BACK TO THE BANK 
WHEN WE GET IT BACK FROM YOU YOU SEE 
BUT I THINK WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO LOOK AT IS SELLING OUR HOUSE 
FIRST FIRST AND THEN COMING OVER AND SAYING 
RIGHT WE'VE GOT THE MONEY HERE WE ARE 
WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE ANY MONEY WITH THIS STORY 
YEAH AND YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES 
TAKE YOUR MONEY BACK AND GO BACK HOME OR WE CAN MAKE A NEW DEAL IF YOU WISH 
YEAH IT'S UP TO YOU YEAH 
COS THAT'S WHAT WE'D PREFER TO DO 
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT I THINK THAT WITHIN TWO MONTHS YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY HOUSE HERE 
THAT'S THE ONLY PROBLEM NO THEY'LL BE SOLD YEAH 
YEAH I STILL CALL IT OURS AND IT ISN'T ANY MORE 
MIND YOU YOU SEE WE PLANNED IT DIDN'T WE 
YEAH WE PLANNED THIS HOUSE 
I MEAN EVEN TO THE CEILINGS 
I WANTED THE CEILINGS UP THERE 
YEAH LOOKS A LOT DIFFERENT TO WHEN WE CAME LAST TIME 
YEAH YOUR DREAM 
IT IS LOOKING GOOD YEAH 
VERY DEPRESSING REALLY IS 
PRESENT FOR THE BABY 
THANK YOU FOR THIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME 
AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT HE'S PREPARED TO GIVE US OUR FULL DEPOSIT BACK 
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA LOSE OUT 
BUT I'M JUST SO PISSED OFF 
OH YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ON TELEVISION CAN YOU 
BUT THIS IS THE LIFE WE WANTED AND LOOK AT IT 
IT'S JUST IDYLLIC ISN'T IT SOME PEOPLE HAVE ALL THE LUCK DON'T THEY 
AND OURS JUST SEEMS TO HAVE HIT ROCK BOTTOM AT THE MOMENT WHAT A BUMMER 
NOWT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT I KNOW I KNOW THAT 
COME HERE OR YOU'LL GET RUN OVER 
PERHAPS WE SHOULD GET SOME COMMISSION FOR LAYING OUT THE PLANS ORIGINALLY 
AFTER WE'D HAD TO GIVE BACK THE GREEK HOUSE 
AND WE CAME HOME I JUST WENT INTO A SPIRAL OF DEPRESSION 
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING WASN'T INTERESTED IN ANYTHING 
EVENTUALLY I'VE COME OUT OF IT AND THEY'VE SAID TO ME 
PERHAPS IT JUST WASN'T MEANT TO BE 
BECAUSE BOTH KEN AND I HAVE HAD MEDICAL PROBLEMS SINCE WE CAME HOME THAT REQUIRED N. H. S. CARE 
AND ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE HOSPITALS OUT IN GREECE 
THEY ARE DIFFICULT TO GET TO 
YOU NEED AN HELICOPTER TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL IN CORFU TOWN 
BECAUSE THE TRAFFIC IS THAT BAD OUT THERE 
SO IN A WAY I'M BETTER OFF WHERE I AM AS AND AS HE IS YOU KNOW 
SO YEAH PERHAPS IT WAS MEANT FOR THE BEST 
I STILL LOVE HIM TO BITS AND HE'S AN ABSOLUTELY SWEETIE YOU KNOW 
DID IT GO OVER MOUNT IT WENT OVER THERE 
AND WELL I COULD JUST EAT HIM REALLY 
GET ON GO ON GO ON 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE THANKFUL FOR WHAT YOU'VE GOT 
DISAPPOINTMENTS YOU HAVE TO GET OVER THEM AND GET ON WITH LIFE 
YOU'RE ON'T GREEN 
LIFE'S PRETTY GOOD 
BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE 
MARGARET HAD TRAVELLED FROM SWITZERLAND 
TO BE WITH US AT THE REUNION IN LEEDS 
HERS HAD BEEN A CINDERELLA STORY 
AT THE THE AGE OF NINETEEN SHE'D BEEN WHISKED AWAY FROM YORKSHIRE 
BY A HANDSOME FOREIGNER FULFILLING ALL OUR ROMANTIC TEENAGE DREAMS 
IT WASN'T AS ROMANTIC ACTUALLY AS I'D THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE 
WHICH CAME AS RATHER A SHOCK 
ATTITUDES TO WOMEN HERE IN SWITZERLAND ARE VERY DIFFERENT 
I MEAN A SWISS MAN DOESN'T EVEN CLEAN HIS OWN SHOES 
HE EXPECTS HIS WIFE TO DO LITERALLY EVERYTHING FOR HIM 
AND HE HAD BECAUSE HIS MOTHER HAD DONE IT 
WELL WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE THAT DIDN'T REALLY BOTHER ME 
BECAUSE I HAD THE CHILDREN REASONABLY QUICKLY 
I MEAN I HAD JULIA WHEN I WAS TWENTY TWO AND I HAD JANE WHEN I WAS TWENTY FOUR 
WHEN I REACHED THEN TWENTY NINE AND I THOUGHT 
GOD YOU KNOW NEXT YEAR YOU'RE GONNA BE THIRTY 
THEN IT WAS REALLY THE TIME WHEN I STARTED TO ASK MYSELF 
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH YOUR LIFE 
AND I THOUGHT VERY LITTLE 
I DON'T REALLY THINK FEMINISM HAS AFFECTED MY LIFE 
I WOULDN'T WANT MY DAUGHTERS TO GET MARRIED AT TWENTY 
AND HAVE CHILDREN AT TWENTY TWO 
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS IN LIFE THAN JUST GETTING MARRIED AND HAVING CHILDREN 
I FELT I'D MISSED OUT I REALLY FELT I'D MISSED OUT 
I SAID I'M FED UP AND I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING WITHOUT OTMAR 
BECAUSE OTMAR AND I DON'T HAVE AN AWFUL LOT IN COMMON 
THROUGH WORK I MET A LOT OF NEW PEOPLE ENGLISH SPEAKING PEOPLE 
WHICH WAS NICE FOR ME AND IT REALLY HELPED ME 
WHEN I GO TO A DISCO AND I'M NOT ASKED TO DANCE IT'S VERY DEPRESSING 
I LIKE ATTENTION FROM MEN I'M A MAN'S WOMAN ANYWAY 
I GET ON FAR BETTER WITH MEN THAN I DO WITH WOMEN 
AND I NEED SOMETHING THAT BELONGS TO ME YOU KNOW MY SCENE 
WHEN I SAW THE FILM TWELVE YEARS AGO I WAS ANGRY AND I WAS UPSET ABOUT IT 
BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE MYSELF AT THAT TIME 
IT UNDERLINED THOSE POINTS 
SO IT WAS VERY UPSETTING FOR ME 
DEEP DOWN INSIDE I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WANT TO LOOK AT THEMSELVES 
AND WHEN SOMEBODY COMES AND STARTS TO 
BORE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE SURFACE YOU JUST START AND ASK YOURSELF QUESTIONS 
SEVEN MONTHS AFTER THE FILM WAS MADE I SEPARATED 
AND TWO YEARS AFTER THAT WE GOT DIVORCED 
MY EX HUSBAND SOLD THE HOUSE 
AND I TOOK AN APARTMENT AND I HAD THE GIRLS LIVING WITH ME 
I HAD MONEY FROM MY EX HUSBAND TO SUPPORT MY DAUGHTERS 
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE MONEY TO SUPPORT ME 
AND THAT WAS VERY GOOD FOR ME 
I DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE ANY MONEY I WANTED TO BE FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT 
SO I DID A TYPING COURSE 
AND THROUGH THAT I BECAME FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT 
AND I'M VERY LUCKY I HAVE WONDERFUL FRIENDS AND 
DIFFERENT FRIENDS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT 
FROM THAN I HAD TWELVE YEARS AGO 
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT 
THERE'S NO MORE DANCING IN BARS AND GOING OUT ON THE TOWN 
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO ME ANY MORE 
I REMEMBER IN THE LAST FILM THAT I SAID I'M A MAN'S WOMAN ANYWAY 
I LIKE THE COMPANY OF MEN THAT'S CHANGED 
IT'S TOTAL REVERSE NOW 
I MEAN MOST OF MY FRIENDS ARE WOMEN 
A GIRLFRIEND OF MINE USED TO GO TO MEDITATION ONCE A WEEK 
AND SHE REALLY SAID THAT SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR ME 
AND IT REALLY DID CHANGE MY LIFE 
I STARTED TO QUESTION WHAT LIFE WAS ALL ABOUT 
AND MY ATTITUDES TO LIFE CHANGED 
MY ATTITUDES TO MATERIAL THINGS CHANGED 
MY ATTITUDES TO MAKING OTHER PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR YOUR HAPPINESS OR UNHAPPINESS THAT CHANGED 
MARGARET'S YOUNGEST DAUGHTER JANE HAS MOVED TO SPAIN WITH HER BOYFRIEND 
A BULGARIAN POLITICAL REFUGEE 
HER OTHER DAUGHTER JULIA LIVES IN A FLAT BELOW HERS 
WHEN THE GIRLS LEFT THAT WAS THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE 
THAT I'D LIVED ALONE AND IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT AT THE BEGINNING 
I DID HAVE A FRIEND FOR FOUR YEARS 
HE DIED THREE YEARS AGO OF A HEART ATTACK VERY SUDDENLY 
MARGARET WAS ALONE FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS BEFORE FINDING SOMEONE ELSE 
I MET SOMEBODY TWENTY YEARS OLDER THAN MYSELF A VERY STRONG CHARACTER 
AN ARTIST A LOT OF CHARISMA 
I'D ONLY KNOWN HIM SIX WEEKS AND WE GOT MARRIED 
MY INTUITION TOLD ME BEFOREHAND IT WAS NOT GOING TO WORK 
BUT I WANTED IT TO WORK AND I STILL HAD THE ROSE TINTED GLASSES ON 
AND I THOUGHT 
THIS IS GONNA BE ROMANTIC BEING MARRIED TO AN ARTIST 
AND IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER 
IT WAS A VERY PAINFUL PROCESS AND TEN MONTHS LATER WE GOT DIVORCED 
FINANCIALLY IT LEFT ME MORE OR LESS BROKE 
BECAUSE I HAD TO PAY THE COURTS AND EVERYTHING 
BUT I DON'T FEEL ANY BITTERNESS 
I DON'T EVEN FEEL ANY BITTERNESS TOWARDS HIM 
HE WASN'T A VERY NICE PERSON BUT I'VE NOT LOST MY FAITH IN MEN 
IT'S THROUGH PAINFUL EXPERIENCES THAT YOU HAVE IN LIFE 
THAT YOU LEARN SO IT WAS IT WAS O. K. 
I HAVE SOMEBODY NOW WHO REALLY CARES 
AND DOES THE THINGS FOR ME THAT I HAVE IN THE PAST DONE FOR MEN 
LUIGI IS FIFTY SIX YEARS OLD AND HAS BEEN IN SWITZERLAND FOR THIRTY TWO YEARS 
HE COMES FROM SOUTHERN ITALY AND HAS A HOUSE THERE AND WOULD EVENTUALLY LIKE TO RETIRE BACK TO ITALY 
HE WANTS TO GO BACK TO HIS ROOTS 
AND OBVIOUSLY WHEN THAT HAPPENS THAT IS THEN GOING TO BE ANOTHER TURNING POINT IN MY LIFE 
WHAT DO I DO I MEAN DO I GO TO ITALY OR DO I STAY HERE 
I REALLY DON'T KNOW TO BE HONEST WITH YOU BECAUSE I DON'T TEND TO PLAN TOO FAR AHEAD 
AND ONE THING I DO KNOW I WOULD BE ALL RIGHT 
CHEERS 
I'M CELEBRATING MY SIXTIETH BIRTHDAY 
I'VE BEEN ORGANISING IT BELIEVE IT OR NOT FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS 
MY DAUGHTER JANE HAS COME ALL THE WAY FROM THE CANARY ISLES SHE'S LIVED ABROAD NOW FOR ABOUT TWELVE YEARS 
SHE'S JUST A FLOATING GYPSY AND SHE'S EXTREMELY HAPPY 
IN THE MEANTIME JULIA HAS MARRIED 
SHE'S HAD TWO CHILDREN A BOY AND A GIRL AND THAT'S GREAT 
WHAT'S IT LIKE BEING A GRANNY 
A NONNA A NONNA I HATE THE WORD GRANNY 
SINCE YOU LAST FILMED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THINGS HAVE REALLY CHANGED TREMENDOUSLY FOR ME 
GIGI WAS OFFERED EARLY RETIREMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND WE DECIDED TO MOVE DOWN TO ITALY 
LOOKING BACK ON IT HAD WE NOT BEEN MARRIED I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I WOULD BE IN ITALY NOW BECAUSE 
I HAD BEEN DESPERATELY MISSING SWITZERLAND WHICH IS REALLY MY HOME 
I HAD THE PROBLEM OF THE FACT I MISSED MY DAUGHTER I MISSED SWITZERLAND I MISSED MY FRIENDS 
AND WHEN WE FIRST CAME DOWN HERE GIGI TOLD ME IF I MAKE THIS MOVE 
DOWN TO ITALY THAT'S IT I AM NOT MOVING ANYWHERE EVER AGAIN 
AND THEN IN THE PROCESS OF DOING ALL THE WORK ON THE HOUSE HE DID HIS BACK IN 
I'M JUST SAYING IT IS NOT WHAT WE PERSONALLY WERE USED TO 
WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE BECAUSE HE HAD INTERNATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE 
I PHONED THEM AT YOU KNOW FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING 
AND BY THE AFTERNOON WE WERE ON OUR WAY BACK TO ZURICH AND THE HOSPITAL WAS ORGANISED 
AND THE SPECIALIST WAS ORGANISED AND WE WENT BACK AND HE HAD HIS TREATMENT THERE 
AND WHEN HE WAS IN HOSPITAL HE SAID TO ME LOOK WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE 
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT HAPPY BEING IN ITALY YOU KNOW ON A FULL TIME BASIS 
AND HE SAID WHY DON'T YOU YOU KNOW TAKE A LOOK AROUND AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND AN APARTMENT THAT 
WOULD BE AFFORDABLE SO THAT WE HAVE A BASE IN SWITZERLAND IN CASE THERE IS YOU KNOW 
ANYTHING REOCCURRING LIKE THIS 
AND THIS HAS ENABLED US TO GO BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC 
GIGI DIDN'T GET MARRIED UNTIL HE WAS FIFTY NINE 
AND I THINK HIS IDEA OF MARRIAGE WAS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TO MY IDEA OF MARRIAGE BECAUSE HE HATES ARGUING 
FOR ME IT WAS PERFECTLY NORMAL 
I'D BEEN MARRIED BEFORE SO I KNEW THAT YOU KNOW YOU DO ARGUE AND IT'S ALL PART OF THE WHOLE PATTERN 
BUT FOR HIM IT WASN'T AND THAT CAUSED US QUITE A LOT OF DIFFICULTIES 
AND I MADE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE WENT AND HAD COUNSELLING 
BUT HE WAS OF THE OPINION THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM THAT I DID 
AND HE DID IN THE END GO WITH ME 
AFTER THAT I REALISED THAT I WAS SELFISH AND AN EGOIST AND 
THERE WERE LOTS OF ASPECTS TO ME THAT I REALLY REALLY DIDN'T LIKE 
I HAD TO TAKE A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE 
I HAD TO STOP YOU KNOW PICKING UP ON THINGS THAT WERE ACTUALLY TOTALLY UNIMPORTANT I HAVE CHANGED 
I HAVE EVOLVED I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT IF I'D HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF DOING THAT IN MY FIRST MARRIAGE 
I'D PROBABLY STILL BE MARRIED TO MY HUSBAND MY FIRST HUSBAND 
BUT I WASN'T YOU NEVER STOP LEARNING 
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TO LEARN 
LIVING IS THE SCHOOL BENCH YOU KNOW AND THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE 
WHEN I WAS AT SCHOOL I WANTED TO GO TO ART SCHOOL 
BUT I WASN'T EVEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY MY FATHER DIDN'T WANT HIS DAUGHTER TO GO TO ART SCHOOL 
BECAUSE SHE'D BE MIXING WITH ALL KINDS OF BEATNIKS AND FUNNY PEOPLE BUT THAT'S THE PAST 
AND NOW I PAINT AND WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL PLACE IN THE VILLAGE THAT YOU CAN RENT FOR EXHIBITIONS 
SO I THOUGHT WELL IF I'M REALLY GONNA DO SOMETHING THEN I'M GOING TO BOOK THIS EXHIBITION 
AND WHEN I ACTUALLY DID THAT I DIDN'T HAVE ONE SINGLE PAINTING 
I DIDN'T HAVE ONE SINGLE PAINTING TO EXHIBIT NOT ONE 
AND I EXHIBITED FORTY PAINTINGS 
AND IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS 
I SOLD EIGHTY PER CENT OF MY PAINTINGS SO I WAS REALLY I WAS REALLY VERY HAPPY 
AND IT HAS GIVEN ME ENCOURAGEMENT AND I'VE SOLD PAINTINGS SINCE 
I'VE EVEN HAD PEOPLE THAT HAVE COMMISSIONED PAINTINGS 
I'VE BEEN VERY VERY LUCKY 
AND I'VE BEEN LUCKY TO MEET GIGI WHO IS SO SUPPORTIVE IN WHAT I'M DOING 
BUT I REMEMBER ONCE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF LECCE AND I WAS GRINNING ALL OVER MY FACE 
AND GIGI CAME UP TO ME AND HE SAID WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING SO HAPPY FOR 
AND I SAID YOU KNOW REALLY EVEN IF WE WON A MILLION EURO TOMORROW 
WE COULDN'T HAVE IT BETTER THAN WE HAVE 
WE COULD HAVE IT BIGGER OR WE COULD HAVE IT MORE EXPENSIVE BUT WE COULDN'T HAVE IT BETTER 
WHEN YOU GO INTO A PARTNERSHIP WHEN YOU GET TO OUR AGE YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO GIVE AND TAKE 
THE VERY FACT THAT WE MOVE BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS TWICE A YEAR 
MEANS THAT WE'RE NEVER IN ONE PLACE LONG ENOUGH TO GET BORED 
WE HAVE MUCH MORE A RELAXED AND LAID BACK LIFE IN ITALY AND WE HAVE OUR ROUTINE 
GOING FOR A WALK 
HAVING A COFFEE OR HAVING A GLASS OF WINE BEFORE DINNER OR WHATEVER OR EVEN JUST A WALK ON THE BEACH 
LITTLE THINGS TAKE ON A DIFFERENT KIND OF IMPORTANCE AND YOU BECOME 
MORE CONTENT WITH THE SIMPLE THINGS IN LIFE 
I'M CONTENT WITH MY LOT AND I HAVE A LOT TO BE CONTENT ABOUT 
AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT NOT TO TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED 
SHE WAS ONLY SIXTEEN 
ONLY SIXTEEN 
I LOVED HER SO 
MARGARET'S CLASSMATE DOROTHY HAS BEEN HAPPILY MARRIED 
TO HER CHILDHOOD SWEETHEART FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS 
I HAVE KNOWN MY HUSBAND IAN NOW EVER SINCE I WAS SEVENYEARS OLD 
WE WERE FOURTEEN WHEN WE STARTED GOING OUT TOGETHER AND THEREFORE WE SEEM TO BE MORE CLOSE KNIT 
SO HAVING PROBLEMS WITH OUR STEPHEN AND NOT BEING ABLE TO GET OUT VERY MUCH WITHOUT HIM 
WE DECIDED THAT IT WERE A GOOD THING IF WE WENT MORRIS DANCING BECAUSE WE COULD GO AS A FAMILY 
WELL I WASN'T A VIRGIN WHEN I GOT MARRIED BUT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT I WAS IN A PERMISSIVE SOCIETY REALLY 
I GOT MARRIED ON TWENTY SIXTH OF MARCH NINETEEN SIXTY SIX AND THEN HAD 
OUR DEBBIE ON FIFTEENTH OF MARCH SIXTY SEVENTH BUT THEN CAME THE SHOCK OF STEPHEN 
I COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM AS SOON AS HE WAS BORN 
BECAUSE HE'S NOW FOURTEEN IN HIS OWN MIND HE'S ABOUT MAYBE FIVE SIX YEAR OLD 
I NOW BELONG TO THE MENCAP GROUP IN HEMSWORTH AND IT GIVES YOU SOMETHING TO FIGHT FOR 
I DID HAVE IT IN MY MIND THAT HE MIGHT DIE IN A LOT OF WAYS YOU THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE A RELIEF 
BUT I DON'T KNOW REALLY 
I THINK THERE IS A THING CALLED DESTINY AND I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT 
I THINK IN THE LAST TWELVE YEARS I HAVE PERHAPS ALTERED QUITE A BIT 
MAYBE YOU GET HARDER IN MANY WAYS 
WHEN I FINALLY FOUND OUT THAT MY HUSBAND WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR I THINK 
I REALLY HAD KNOWN AT THE BACK OF MY MIND THAT SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING 
BUT IT WAS A BIG SHOCK BECAUSE I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME 
THEY TALK ABOUT THE MALE MENOPAUSE WHICH SEEMS TO BE A CLICHE IN ITSELF 
BUT EVERYTHING SEEMED TO HAPPEN WHEN IAN REACHED FORTY 
AND HE JUST DIDN'T LIKE IT AND SEEMED TO BE WANTING TO GO BACK TO HIS TEENAGE YEARS 
WHEN HE LEFT HOME THE FIRST THING THAT HE BOUGHT WAS A MOTORBIKE AGAIN 
I THINK WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEBODY AND YOU PUT YOUR TRUST IN THEM YOU NEVER GOT OVER THE HURT 
I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER GET OVER THAT REALLY 
BEEN ON MY OWN FOR GOING ON TEN YEARS 
I'VE NO PLANS AT ALL AT THIS TIME ANYWAY TO TO RE MARRY OR TAKE UP ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP 
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SOMEBODY REALLY SPECIAL FOR 
ME TO GIVE UP MY INDEPENDENCE NOW EVEN THOUGH MAYBE REALLY I DON'T FEEL INDEPENDENT BECAUSE I'VE GOT STEPHEN 
MY CHILDREN HAVE BOTH GROWN UP 
MY DAUGHTER HAS LEFT HOME 
SHE'S BEEN TO COLLEGE DONE A HONOURS DEGREE IS NOW TEACHING 
MY SON GOES TO A TRAINING CENTRE IN HEMSWORTH WHICH IS NOT VERY FAR AWAY 
AT THE TIME WHEN IAN LEFT MY MOTHER IN LAW LIVED NEXT DOOR 
AND BECAUSE OF THAT IT WAS EASIER PERHAPS FOR ME TO GET A JOB 
SHE OFFERED TO PUT STEPHEN ON THE BUS TO THE TRAINING CENTRE AND TO LOOK AFTER HIM UNTIL I GOT HOME FROM WORK 
AND THEN SHE MOVED AWAY 
THEN MY MOTHER CAME TO LIVE IN THE VILLAGE AND SHE TOOK OVER THIS CARING ROLE WHAT'S IT LIKE OUTSIDE 
IT'S THROWING IT DOWN IS IT OH NO 
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT MY MUM'S NOW ILL SHE'S HAD THREE HEART ATTACKS 
AT THE MOMENT SHE'S STAYING WITH ME 
BUT HOPEFULLY SHE'LL BE GOING BACK TO HER OWN HOUSE WHICH IS REALLY ONLY FIVE MINUTES' WALK AWAY FROM HERE 
I'M NOW AN OFFICE ADMINISTRATOR AT THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 
THERE'S MORE AND MORE WOMEN MY OWN AGE GROUP WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT ON THEIR OWN 
I THINK WE KNOW THAT WE CAN RELY ON EACH OTHER BYE 
TO HELP OUT WITH EACH OTHER'S CHILDREN EACH OTHER'S FAMILIES THE GRANDCHILDREN OR WHATEVER 
IT COMES NATURALLY TO STICK TOGETHER 
ULTIMATELY I MAY HAVE TO GIVE MY JOB UP IF IT JUST DOESN'T WORK OUT 
I SEE THAT I WOULD REALLY HAVE NO CHOICE 
I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO ASKING PEOPLE FOR HELP 
THE FOLK CLUB THAT I GO TO ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT GETS GOING USUALLY ABOUT QUARTER TO NINE 
USUALLY HIS DAD COMES AND LOOKS AFTER HIM ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
BUT IF HE'S ON HOLIDAY THEN I DON'T JUST STOP AT HOME I TAKE HIM WITH ME 
AND STEPHEN DOES ENJOY COMING WITH US IN FACT HE LOVES IT 
BUT BY THE TIME I'M DRIVING HOME AGAIN IT'S VERY OFTEN QUARTER TO TWELVE AND STEPHEN GETS VERY TIRED 
I SUPPOSE I'M THE PERPETUAL SINGLE PARENT REALLY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T JUST GO AND DO WHATEVER YOU WANT 
YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT TO BE THINKING ABOUT STEPHEN AS WELL 
BUT IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO GO AND YOU KNOW JUST HAVE A NIGHT OUT ON MY OWN 
I'M WAITING TO GO TO BED 
GIVE ME A KISS 
NIGHT NIGHT GOD BLESS 
ALL RIGHT 
IT'S BEEN A BIG CHANGE IN THESE LAST TWELVE YEARS 
WHEN I WAS AT WORK I I DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT STEPHEN BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD HIS GRANDMAS THERE 
COME ON GET TO BED NOW 
GO ON CHEEKY 
MY MUM DYING MEANT THAT I DIDN'T HAVE THE BACK UP THAT I HAD PREVIOUSLY 
AU REVOIR 
MY DAUGHTER DEBBIE SHE'S ALWAYS HELPED ME WITH STEPHEN AND EVEN MORE SO SINCE MY MUM DIED 
BUT AT THE MOMENT SHE'S QUITE ILL SO SHE CAN'T LOOK AFTER HIM THEN 
WHEN THEY WERE NO LONGER ON THE SCENE THEN YOU KNOW THE WORRY 
OF THINKING YOU KNOW IF HE'S ILL YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE TIME OFF WORK 
THE STRESS FINALLY GOT TO ME AND 
SINCE I HAVE GIVEN UP WORK I'VE FOUND I CAN LIVE QUITE HAPPILY ON WHAT I HAVE GOT 
WHEN I WAS SIXTY I DECIDED THAT I WOULD HAVE TO GO AND SORT MY WILL OUT 
NOT BECAUSE YOU KNOW I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE 
YOU KNOW BUT BECAUSE OF STEPHEN 
I HAVE HAD TO THINK ABOUT PUTTING MY LIFE IN ORDER TALKING TO MY DAUGHTER 
ABOUT WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN WITH STEPHEN 
SHE DID ACTUALLY SAY TO ME WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT DYING FOR 
AND I SAYS NO I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT DYING I'M JUST PUTTING MY HOUSE IN ORDER 
I'M GETTING UP 
HAVE YOU HAD A GOOD SLEEP YEAH 
AH COME ON THEN 
WITH THERE ONLY BEING THE TWO OF US HE'S VERY CLINGY 
I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO THINK THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO LIVE LONG ENOUGH 
TO SEE STEPHEN TO THE END OF HIS LIFE 
NOT THAT I WANT HIM TO DIE BUT BECAUSE HE'S JUST TOO USED TO THERE JUST BEING ME AND HIM 
OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT PLACES 
FOR STEPHEN TO GO ON RESPITE 
TO HELP HIM TO GET USED TO BEING WITH OTHER PEOPLE 
SHOULD ANYTHING HAPPEN TO ME 
UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NOT MANY WHAT I WOULD CALL AS GOOD HOMES 
MAYBE IT'S ME BEING FUSSY BUT AS A MOTHER YOU WANT THE BEST 
FOR YOUR OWN CHILD AND HE IS STILL A CHILD IN MY EYES AND VULNERABLE 
AND IT'S ALWAYS ON THE TELEVISION ABOUT PEOPLE BEING ABUSED 
THERE'S YOUR VIKING RING 
HE LOVES TO GET DRESSED UP AND HE HAS GOT A WIDE VARIETY OF INTERESTS' 
AND HE DOESN'T JUST SIT IN A CHAIR AND WATCH TELEVISION 
YOU PUT YOUR BOX AT THIS SIDE 
TODAY IT'S STEPHEN'S BIRTHDAY AND WE'RE GOING TO YORK WITH THE FULL INTENTIONS OF BUYING SOME CHAIN MAIL 
EACH YEAR HE'S GATHERED LITTLE MEMENTOS TO BOOST HIS VIKING OUTFIT 
STEPHEN REGARDS IT AS HIS BIRTHDAY TREAT 
STEPHEN'S THIRTY EIGHT AND WHEN HE WAS BORN THE DOCTORS WERE SAYING TO ME HE'LL PROBABLY NEVER REACH FIFTEEN 
SO FOR YEARS I HAD IT RUNNING THROUGH MY MIND THAT HE WAS GOING TO DIE 
NICE TO SEE YOU STEPHEN 
NICE TO SEE YOU ARE YOU O. K. YEAH 
SAW YOU LAST YEAR YOU'VE COME TO DO SOME MORE VIKING FIGHTING HAVE YOU 
I HAVE GOOD GOOD 
OH I DON'T EXPECT TO LIVE TO A GREAT AGE 
BECAUSE MOST OF THE REST OF THE FAMILY HAVE GONE BEFORE THEY'VE BEEN SEVENTY FIVE 
SO IF I LIVE TO TURN EIGHTY I SUPPOSE I WOULD REGARD IT AS 
A BONUS REALLY PROVIDING I'VE GOT ALL MY FACULTIES AND CAN GET ABOUT 
COULD HE TRY IT ON 
YEAH SURE 
THE WORST THING WOULD BE TO GET TO AN OLD AGE AND BE JUST SITTING IN A WHEELCHAIR 
YEAH THAT'S FITTING YOUR HEAD PERFECTLY 
BYE 
NOW THE BATTLE'S OVER 
THERE WE ARE 
ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE IT OFF YEAH 
IN MANY WAYS I'VE BEEN SPARED 
A LOT OF THE ANGUISH OF WHAT A LOT OF TEENAGERS ARE GOING THROUGH 
WITH DRUG ABUSE AND GOING OUT AND GETTING DRUNK AND INTO FIGHTS' 
I BET YOU'LL NEVER COME CLEAN 
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT WHILE WE GET YOU BACK GIVE YOU A WASH 
COME ON THEN 
STEPHEN HAS HAD 
A FEW GIRLFRIENDS AS HE CALLS THEM 
UM BUT IT'S IT'S ONLY 
UM A BOY GIRL UM FRIENDSHIP 
I DON'T THINK FOR ONE MINUTE THAT IT EVEN CROSSES HIS MIND THAT YOU KNOW 
ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT SORT OF RELATIONSHIP WOULD HAPPEN 
IF HE WATCHES SOMEONE ON TELEVISION AND THEY'RE KISSING HE'LL SAY OH LOOK THEY'RE GETTING MARRIED 
ALMIGHTY GOD WHO FORGIVES ALL WHO TRULY REPENT HAVE MERCY UPON YOU 
I'VE ALWAYS GONE TO CHURCH EXCEPT AFTER I GOT DIVORCED 
I ACTUALLY CAME BACK TO GOING TO CHURCH AFTER MY DAD DIED 
GOD'S HOLY GIFTS FOR GOD'S HOLY PEOPLE 
I'M THE SORT OF PERSON THAT'S MAYBE GOT INNER STRENGTHS 
AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT SOMETIMES I'VE NOT GONE TO PIECES BECAUSE I HAVE 
UM YOU KNOW IT'S UM 
PEOPLE THAT ARE CLOSE TO ME KNOW THAT I'VE HAD VERY VERY LOW MOMENTS 
WHERE I'VE MAYBE YOU KNOW CRIED NON STOP FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS 
THEN I'VE SORT OF COME OUT OF IT AT THE OTHER END 
BUT I'VE HAD A LOT OF HELP FROM SOME REALLY VERY GOOD FRIENDS 
THE BODY OF CHRIST KEEP YOU IN ETERNAL LIFE 
AMEN 
I THINK I'VE HAD QUITE A NICE LIFE REALLY 
I'VE GOT MY OWN HOUSE I'VE GOT A CAR 
I'VE YOU KNOW GOT MONEY FOR FOOD AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
NICE CLOTHES AND REASONABLE HEALTH 
SO I DON'T THINK I CAN GRUMBLE REALLY 
THERE'S PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW HAVE ACTUALLY SAID TO ME 
WE ENVY YOU BECAUSE WE'RE COMPLETELY ON OUR OWN 
AND YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY THERE ALL THE TIME 
YOU KNOW SO IT'S I OFTEN HAVE THIS YOUNG CHILD IF YOU LIKE 
WHO YOU KNOW JUST LOVES TO MAKE FUN 
BLAH HA 
THE THING THAT I'VE LEARNT MOST IN LIFE IS THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS LOVE 
RATHER THAN MONEY OR ANYTHING ELSE 
I THINK I SUPPOSE MOSTLY WE'VE GOT TO LOVE OURSELVES 
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T LOVE OURSELVES THEN WE MIGHT AS WELL NOT BE HERE 
I'M CONFESSIN' THAT I LOVE YOU BY FRANK IFIELD 
I'M CONFESSIN' THAT I LOVE YOU 
TELL ME DO YOU LOVE ME TOO 
I'M CONFESSIN' THAT I NEED YOU HONEST I DO 
OF ALL OF US BACK AT THE REUNION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE 
SALLY HAD BEEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL 
AND PERHAPS THE ONE WITH THE MOST CLAIM TO FAME 
WHEN I LEFT SCHOOL I LEARNT THAT IN FACT ACTING WAS THE ONLY THING 
THAT I HAD ANY APPLICATION FOR THAT I STUCK AT 
COME ON 
EVERYTHING ELSE I'D TRIED I'D JUST GIVEN IT UP GET A STICK NOW 
MY MOTHER REALLY WAS THE INFLUENCE BECAUSE SHE WAS A GREAT AMATEUR ACTRESS THAT WAS HER LIFE REALLY 
SHE DEFINITELY INTRODUCED ME TO IT 
NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO I WENT INTO CROSSROADS THE BIG C. 
AND I GOT THE PART OF A VERY STRANGE YOUNG LADY CALLED JANE SMITH 
SHE WAS A WAITRESS BUT WAS GENERAL DOGSBODY AS WELL SHE OFTEN WAS FOUND 
IN THE CHALETS DOING A BIT OF CLEANING AND THEN BEHIND RECEPTION AND MOSTLY IN THE KITCHEN THOUGH 
YEAH CHATTING UP THE CHEF 
I LEFT CROSSROADS SAYING COULD I HAVE SIX MONTHS OFF WITH THE INTENTION 
OF ENDEAVOURING TO GET PREGNANT 
AND IT WORKED OUT EXACTLY 
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SORT OF BEEN AT HOME WITH HER FOR ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS I SUPPOSE 
AND THEN GONE BACK 
BUT THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT QUITE LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT ME BACK 
HERE WE ARE JACK 
I STAYED AT HOME AND LOOKED AFTER DAISY TILL SHE WAS TWO 
GOT THOROUGHLY BORED WITH IT SO I HAD TO DO SOMETHING 
IT WAS IAN'S IDEA THAT I SHOULD WRITE A BOOK HE ALWAYS THOUGHT I COULD WRITE 
SO HE'S NOW OUT OF WORK AND HE LOOKS AFTER DAISY WHILST I WRITE 
A WHIRLPOOL OF DESOLATION TUGGED AT HER DRAWING HER TOWARDS THE CRUMPLED BED 
WHERE THE IMPRINT OF RICHARD'S LONG BODY STILL CREASED THE COVER 
I READ LOTS OF MILLS AND BOON BOOKS BEFORE I EVEN STARTED WRITING TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT THEY WANTED 
AND IF IT'S PUBLISHED I SHOULD LIKE TO WRITE LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS 
MILLS AND BOONS AND MAKE LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF MONEY OUT OF IT AND THEN AFTER THAT 
I WOULD THEN LIKE TO START TO WRITING A COMEDY 
COMEDY BOOKS 
COME ON THEN WE'RE COMING UP FOR OUR TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY IN THIS HOUSE 
STILL LOVING IT 
HELLO 
I WAS GOING TO WRITE LOTS AND LOTS OF MILLS AND BOONS AND MAKE LOTS AND LOTS OF MONEY 
I DID MAKE QUITE A BIT OF MONEY BUT I ONLY DID ONE 
AND REALLY THE FANTASTIC MONEY IS WHEN YOU WRITE ABOUT TWO A YEAR 
AND IT ALL ACCUMULATES THEN 
THEN MY MOTHER WHO WAS LIVING WITH US WAS TAKEN VERY ILL 
WITH WHAT I TAKE TO BE MIDDLE ONSET ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 
AND FROM THEN ON I'VE JUST HAD TO LOOK AFTER HER 
I'M AN ONLY CHILD SO THERE'S NOBODY ELSE WHO CAN LOOK AFTER MOTHER 
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE IT'S WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO SEE 
IT'S HAVING A VERY GREAT EFFECT ON THE FAMILY 
YES I THINK IT HAS ON ANY FAMILY 
GET AWAY GOOD GOD DON'T YOU DARE 
I'M NOT IT HASN'T BEEN A STRAIN ON THE MARRIAGE WE'VE ACTUALLY GROWN TOGETHER 
BUT WE FIND THAT YOU KNOW WE WANT TO BE MORE TOGETHER ALL THE TIME 
AND WE CAN'T BE 
IAN GOES OFF TO WORK AT FOUR AND HE HAS THE CAR 
SO MOTHER AND I ARE JUST ON OUR OWN TOGETHER 
OH 
THERE WE ARE IS THAT BETTER YEAH THAT'S LOVELY THANK YOU 
SHE CAN'T HELP BEING THE WAY SHE IS' 
AH 
PORTUGUESE SHAMPOO AGAIN 
OH REALLY I WISH I WISH I WISH THAT I COULD BE MORE SYMPATHETIC TO HER AND MORE CARING 
AND LOVING AND ALL THE THINGS I WANT TO BE TO HER 
WHEN DAISY WAS PLAYING THE PIANO THERE 
PHOTOGRAPH OF HER ON THE PIANO 
A VITAL ENERGETIC 
LOVELY AN AWFUL LOT OF THE TIME BUT THEN SHE'S VERY VERY HARD WORK 
WELL IT'S GOT A NICE LITTLE KINK TO IT NICE LITTLE KINK TO IT YES 
DAISY AND GRAN 
IT WAS NEVER A COSY RELATIONSHIP NO NEVER GRANDMA GRANDDAUGHTER RELATIONSHIP 
AND IT'S NOW BECOME THEY'RE JUST TOTALLY ESTRANGED 
THEY CAN BARELY BARELY BRING THEMSELVES TO SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER 
WHICH IS A VERY SAD THING 
I DO FEEL TRAPPED 
AND I DO HATE MOTHER 
AND I HATE MYSELF FOR HATING MOTHER 
AND I HATE MYSELF FOR HATING ME 
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IT'S POINTLESS ABSOLUTELY POINTLESS HATING YOURSELF 
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN ALL THE TIME 
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS TEN YEARS AGO I COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT 
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE JUST I WOULD HAVE THROWN IN THE TOWEL 
SO I'VE GROWN 
TEN YEARS AGO 
WE DECIDED FOR OUR TWENTY FIFTH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY 
THAT WE WERE GOING TO GO ON A FANTASTIC TRIP 
WE WENT TO THE ISLAND OF SAINT HELENA IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN 
AND WE PUT MY MOTHER IN RESPITE CARE 
SHE'D ALWAYS SAID TO ME DON'T EVER PUT ME IN A HOME 
YOU KNOW AND IT WAS KIND OF WRITTEN IN STONE BUT ANYWAY I HAD TO 
AND SHE WENT INTO THE HOME FOR RESPITE CARE WHILST WE WERE AWAY 
AND AND WHEN WE CAME BACK WE SAID WELL YOU KNOW HOW DID YOU GET ON 
AND SHE SAID OH WELL IT WAS ALL RIGHT AND SHE STAYED THERE 
AND SHE LIVED THERE FOR SIX MONTHS AND THEN DIED 
I THINK I FELT GUILT ALL THE WAY ALONG 
BUT SHE'D WASTED SO MUCH OF MY LIFE 
I'D SPENT ALL THIS TIME LOOKING AFTER THIS OLD DRUNKEN LADY 
YES IT WAS JUST 
THAT YOU FELT RELIEF DID YOU YOU KNOW HUGE RELIEF 
I FELT RELIEF FOR HER AS WELL I MEAN SHE WAS SO UNHAPPY 
AND IT WAS A RELEASE BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU ARE ALONE 
YOU'RE AN ORPHAN 
WE LIVED HERE WITH DAIS Y. 
THEN SHE WENT TO UNIVERSITY 
AND THEN SHE CAME BACK AND TOOK A FEW THINGS AWAY 
AND I SUDDENLY REALISED THAT THAT WAS IT SHE'D GONE 
AND I FELL APART FOR ABOUT THREE DAYS 
AND AND THEN AFTER THAT IAN AND I SORT OF LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER 
AND WE THOUGHT RIGHT KIDS THIS IS IT WE ARE ALONE 
AFTER THREE YEARS OF RELENTLESS DIY 
SALLY AND IAN ARE SELLING THEIR WELSH FARMHOUSE 
TO FINANCE THEIR DREAMS FOR THE FUTURE 
WE'RE JUST SELLING WE'RE NOT GOING TO TRY AND FIND ANYWHERE TO MOVE IN TO STRAIGHTAWAY 
WE'LL BUY A CAMPERVAN AND SEE WHERE WE WANT TO LIVE 
I'LL START FROM THE BOTTOM AND WORK UP AND YOU START FROM THE TOP AND WORK DOWN 
NOW THAT I'M SIXTY EVERYBODY ELSE SAYS IT'S SORT OF YOU KNOW 
THE END YOU'VE REACHED YOUR RETIREMENT AGE 
GO AND GET YOUR SLIPPERS AND YOUR PIPE AND SIT BY THE FIRE 
WELL I DON'T THINK LIKE THAT 
I THINK THAT I HAVE AT LEAST ANOTHER GOOD TWENTY YEARS OF ADVENTURE 
OH THIS IS JOY WE BOTH THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS A GOOD PLAN 
CRETE WE'D MAKE FOR YEAH IF WE FIND SOMETHING ELSE ON THE WAY 
YOU KNOW IF THIS HOUSE IN A BEAUTIFUL VILLAGE SOMEWHERE IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE 
JUST SAYS BUY ME WE WILL OR WE'LL YOU KNOW CARRY ON 
WE MAY NEVER FIND A PLACE WE MAY JUST GO AROUND EUROPE FOREVER YOU KNOW ENJOYING OURSELVES 
ON THE ROAD TO FIND OUT BY CAT STEVENS 
WELL I LEFT MY HAPPY HOME 
TO SEE WHAT I COULD FIND OUT 
I LEFT MY FOLK AND FRIENDS 
WITH AN AIM TO CLEAR MY MIND OUT 
IT WAS MY GRANDFATHER'S DESK 
THAT WAS WHAT I WAS GONNA WRITE MY NEXT NOVEL ON 
I HIT THE ROWDY ROAD AND MANY KINDS 
IT'S TINY MANY STORIES TOLD ME ME A WAY 
TO GET THERE OOH OOH 
THE NIGHT BEFORE WE CAME TO GET THE CAMPERVAN NEITHER OF US SLEPT 
WE WOKE UP AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND WE JUST CHURNED EVERYTHING 
I MEAN I WAS CHURNING ALL SORTS OF THINGS ABOUT THE MONEY AND UM PRACTICALITIES 
I'VE SENT AWAY FOR MY DRIVING LICENCE AND WHERE IS IT GOING TO BE SENT YOU KNOW 
JUST REAL PRACTICAL STUFF IS VERY DIFFICULT WHEN YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY GOT A HOME YEAH 
I THINK HE'S FEELING SCARED BUT HE DOESN'T EMOTE 
I THINK HE'S NERVOUS AND HE'S VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT LEAVING DAISY BEHIND YOU KNOW WE BOTH ARE 
WE'RE LEAVING HER BEHIND WHICH IS WHAT PARENTS USUALLY EXPERIENCE 
THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GET LEFT BEHIND AND HAVE THE EMPTY NEST AND IT'S DAISY WHO'S EXPERIENCING THAT 
LOOK AFTER YOURSELF AND YOU 
THAT'S THE BIG WRENCH 
THAT REALLY IS IT'S 
IT'S NOT PLACES IT'S PEOPLE 
THEN I FOUND MYSELF ALONE HOPING SOMEONE WOULD MISS ME 
THINKING ABOUT MY HOME AND THE LAST WOMAN TO KISS ME 
KISS ME 
BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO MOAN 
NOTHING SEEMS TO SUIT YOU 
BUT NEVERTHELESS YOU KNOW 
YOU'VE LOCKED THE DOOR TOWARDS THE FUTURE 
M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. 
SO ON AND ON YOU GO 
THE SECONDS TICK THE TIME OUT 
THERE'S SO MUCH LEFT TO KNOW AND I'M ON THE ROAD TO FIND OUT 
OOH OOH OOH OOH OOH 
THE MOMENT WE LANDED ON CRETE I FELT AS IF I'D COME HOME 
THIS IS IT 
ISN'T IT FANTASTIC 
WE'VE BEEN ON THE ROAD NOW FOR THREE MONTHS 
WELL I SET OFF REALLY TO HAVE A WANDER ROUND 
AND FIND OUT WHAT I LIKED AND WHERE WE MIGHT LIVE 
AND I THOUGHT OH IT COULD TAKE ABOUT A YEAR YOU KNOW BUT IAN'S MORE SENSIBLE THAN I AM 
HE'S A ROMANTIC BUT HE'S NOT AS DAFT AS I AM 
AND HE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS IF WE DID ALL THAT FOR OVER A YEAR WE'D END UP WITH NO MONEY 
SO HE SAID THE BEST THING TO DO WOULD BE TO BUY SOMETHING 
AND HAVE SOMETHING CONCRETE AND THEN DO THE WANDERING ABOUT 
I'VE BEEN MORE AWARE OF IAN'S NEEDS AND WANTS AND THINGS' 
AND I HAVE REALISED ACTUALLY THAT I'VE BEEN QUITE SELFISH I'VE BEEN TOTALLY SELFISH 
WHAT SALLY WANTED WAS PERHAPS NOT WHAT WE BOTH WANTED 
IT WAS A CASE OF THE COMPROMISE 
WE HAVEN'T JUST BEEN CAMPING IN THE VAN WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT HOUSES 
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT WELL OLD RUINS ACTUALLY SO THAT WE CAN BUY AN OLD RUIN AND DO IT UP 
AND WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF RUINS 
BUT WE ALSO DECIDED THAT WE'D HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING 
THAT WAS LIVEABLE IN THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY BE COMFORTABLE IN SO WE'VE BOUGHT A LITTLE HOUSE 
LOTS OF LITTLE PLANTINGS ALL OVER THE PLACE 
WE BOTH LOVE OUR COMFORT AND OUR LUXURY 
THIS IS A FAIRLY LUXURIOUS CAMPERVAN IN ITS WAY BUT IT'S STILL PRIMITIVE 
WE KNEW THAT IF WE ACTUALLY BOUGHT THIS HOUSE AND HAD IT 
THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GO IN THERE AND USE THE SHOWER AND HAVE COMFORT 
IT WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLE 
WE SWILLED OURSELVES UNDER THE SHOWER AND HAD A WONDERFUL TIME 
THIS HOUSE IS TO LET REALLY AND IT WAS VERY CHEAP IT WAS ALREADY UP WE COULD MOVE INTO IT STRAIGHTAWAY 
IT COST US FIFTY NINE THOUSAND THERE'S A WHOLE GROUP OF US HERE 
THERE ARE TEN OF THESE LITTLE HOUSES 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE ACTUALLY LIVED IN THIS KIND OF VILLAGE COMMUNITY 
WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR BUSINESS THEY ALL KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND WHERE YOU'VE BEEN 
AND I FIND IT A BIT CORONATION STREET IN THE WILDS OF CRETE 
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE MOVING OUT OF HERE 
AND GOING TO LIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE WE'LL BE FAR MORE SPREAD OUT 
WHILE ENJOYING THE COMFORTS OF THEIR NEW HOUSE 
SALLY AND IAN CONTINUED TO HUNT FOR THEIR PERFECT RURAL RETREAT 
ALL OUR FRIENDS SAID DON'T BUY A RUIN YOU'VE DONE THAT ONE YOU'RE SIXTY JUST SIT BACK AND RELAX 
YES INTERESTING 
I LOVE THIS ONE I REALLY LOVE IT 
IT MUST BE OLD AND WE BOUGHT IT 
IT LOOKS IT IS A RUIN 
IT'S A WRECK OH IT'S SUCH A SHAME 
M. M. M. IT'S GOING TO TAKE US ALL OUR TIME AND EFFORT AND YOUTH WHAT'S LEFT OF IT TO DO IT UP 
YEAH THIS WOULD BE GREAT AS A BEDROOM ACTUALLY 
IT'S BIG ENOUGH ISN'T IT YEAH WHERE'S THE BED GOING TO BE THEN HERE 
OBVIOUSLY THE WHOLE LOT'S GONNA COME DOWN 
YEAH IT WAS ALWAYS A DREAM 
I'VE WORKED OUT THAT IF YOU ACTUALLY VISUALISE SOMETHING ENOUGH SEE IT IN YOUR MIND 
AND WORK TOWARDS IT THEN IT WILL COME TO BE 
I HAVEN'T REALLY CONSIDERED ANYTHING FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF SECURITY 
FOR THE WHOLE OF MY LIFE I DON'T HAVE A PENSION I DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW 
JUST THE STATE PENSION I HAVEN'T PLANNED ANYTHING I JUST SAID 
OH THE WELL THE HOUSE WILL BE MY PENSION WHICH IT'S TURNED OUT TO BE 
BUT I'VE ALWAYS LET THE FUTURE HAPPEN WHAT WILL BE WILL BE 
CIRCLE GAME BY JONI MITCHELL 
AND THE SEASONS THEY GO ROUND AND ROUND 
AND THEN THE PAINTED PONIES GO UP AND DOWN 
WE'RE CAPTIVE ON A CAROUSEL OF TIME 
WE CAN'T RETURN WE CAN ONLY LOOK BEHIND 
FROM WHERE WE CAME AND GO ROUND AND ROUND 
AND ROUND IN THE CIRCLE GAME 
IN THE CIRCLE GAME
