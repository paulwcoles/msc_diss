NOT TOO MUCH DAMAGE THANK YOU GOD 
DIBLEY MUST BE IN FAVOUR AT THE MOMENT 
OR NOT 
MEETING OPEN NOW DAMAGE AFTER THE GREAT STORM 
DO YOU WANT TO CALL IT THE GREAT STORM COS THERE WAS ONE IN SIXTY SIX 
ALL RIGHT THE QUITE GREAT STORM 
HOW ABOUT THE BIG FOR GOODNESS SAKE OVER TO YOU VICAR 
AS YOU KNOW OUR WINDOW WAS SMASHED BY A TREE IN THE STORM WITH NO NAME 
DO WE REPLACE IT WITH THE SAME IMAGE OR DO WE GO FOR SOMETHING A BIT MORE MODERN AND EXCITING 
LIKE THIS CHAGALL WINDOW HERE OH YES 
I LIKE THE OLD ONE ME TOO 
YES YOU'RE RIGHT ARTY FARTY FROGGIE NONSENSE 
SO ANOTHER TRADITIONAL RENDITION OF JESUS FEEDING THE FIVE THOUSAND 
RIGHT NO NO I DON'T THINK IT WAS JESUS 
IT WERE TOO FAT FOR JESUS 
NOT JESUS I THINK IT WAS MOSES 
MOSES AND THE FEEDING OF THE FIVE THOUSAND DOES HAVE A SLIGHTLY ODD RING TO IT 
IT WASN'T MOSES MOSES HAD A BEARD 
SO NOT JESUS NOT MOSES ANYONE GOT ANY IDEA WHO OUR MYSTERY MAN WAS 
SAINT BARNABUS AS WE'RE IN THE CHURCH OF SAINT BARNABUS 
LOGICAL 
THERE WAS A CHAP WITH A BEARD IN THE BACKGROUND HOLDING A BIG LUMP OF STONE 
MOSES CARRYING THE COMMANDMENTS FOR SAINT BARNABUS 
I'M NOT SURE THAT MOSES OF EGYPT AND SAINT BARNABUS OF WOLVERHAMPTON WERE THE BEST OF FRIENDS 
BUT IF IT WASN'T MOSES WHY WAS HE HOLDING THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 
PERHAPS IT WASN'T PERHAPS IT WAS JUST A BIG BOOK 
SO WHERE ARE WE WE'VE GOT SAINT BARNABUS AND A MYSTERIOUS CHAP HOLDING A BIG BOOK 
COULD IT BE THAT WE HAVE HERE THE FIRST DEPICTION IN STAINED GLASS OF THIS IS YOUR LIFE 
PERHAPS THE BLOKE WITH THE BOOK WAS A LIBRARIAN 
A LIBRARIAN 
YES AND SAINT BARNABUS WENT INTO THE LIBRARY 
IN WOLVERHAMPTON 
TO BORROW A HOLY BOOK 
WELL IF IT WAS A LIBRARY WHY WERE THERE FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN IT 
I NEVER THOUGHT THEY WERE PEOPLE 
SORRY JIM I ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY WERE SHEEP 
JESUS AND THE FEEDING OF THE FIVE THOUSAND SHEEP 
BUT I THOUGHT WE'VE AGREED IT WASN'T JESUS IT WAS SAINT BARNABUS 
AND THE LIBRARIAN 
PRETTY BLOODY ODD LIBRARY WITH FIVE THOUSAND SHEEP IN IT 
ALL RIGHT HOLD IT THERE WE'RE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF LOONY LAND HERE HEADING FOR CITY CENTRE 
WE SHOULD FIND OLD PICTURES OF THE WINDOW 
I MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE ONE ON ME HERE OH 
EXCELLENT PROBLEM SOLVED 
HERE WE GO THERE 
THIS IS A PICTURE OF YOUR DOG JIM 
NO NO NO NO THAT'S RIGHT 
BUT 
BUT HE WAS STANDING OUTSIDE THE CHURCH 
AND I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU MIGHT SEE THE WINDOW 
IN THE REFLECTION IN HIS EYE 
I'VE HAD A THOUGHT 
THE OLD BOOK OF MINUTES HAS THE ENTRY FROM WHEN THE WINDOW WAS ACTUALLY BUILT 
WORTH A TRY AND YOU'LL FIND IT DEPICTED JESUS DELIVERING THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT 
ABSOLUTELY FROM A BOAT 
I BEG YOUR PARDON 
JESUS WAS STANDING IN A BOAT 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A BOAT SHAPED CIGAR 
DING DING EVERYONE OFF LOONY LAND CITY CENTRE 
FRANK'S HAD A TRIUMPHANT WEEK TELL US FRANK 
WELL TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT I FINALLY FOUND THE OLD BOOK OF MINUTES 
AND THERE WAS A DRAWING BY THE ORIGINAL ARTIST OF OUR NORTH WINDOW 
AND ITS BEAUTIFUL PORTRAYAL OF NOAH'S ARK 
NOAH'S ARK RIGHT 
SO THE MAN IN THE FRONT WAS NOAH RIGHT 
THE FIVE THOUSAND WERE ANIMALS YES AND THE MAN WITH THE BEARD 
A LLAMA 
IMAGINE MOSES LOOKING LIKE A LLAMA 
NO WONDER EVERYBODY TOOK SUCH NOTICE OF HIM 
WELL BRAVO FRANK 
UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE SOME RATHER BAD NEWS 
THE LAST TIME I HEARD THAT VICAR IT WAS THE END OF REAL TEETH 
I HAVE SPENT THE WEEK INVESTIGATING THE PRICES OF STAINED GLASS 
AND THE LOWEST QUOTE WE HAD WAS ELEVEN THOUSAND 
BUGGER ME 
YOU COULD GET SOMEONE KILLED FOR THAT 
I'M AFRAID THAT THAT PUTS US IN AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION 
MINUTE THAT DIBLEY CAN'T AFFORD A NEW WINDOW 
CAN'T ISN'T IN THE CHRISTIAN VOCABULARY IT IS 
YOU CAN'T COMMIT ADULTERY YOU CAN'T STEAL 
AND YOU CAN'T EVEN COVET YOUR NEIGHBOUR'S ASS 
EVEN IF IT IS VERY ALLURING 
I MEAN WE CAN ACHIEVE ANYTHING WE WANT 
THEY SAID TO JESUS YOU CAN'T WALK ON WATER YOUR DRESS'LL GET WET BUT HE DID 
THEY SAID TO ROLF HARRIS YOU CAN'T DO STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN BUT HE DID 
AND VERY SUCCESSFULLY IN MY OPINION 
THAT'S ALL VERY WELL BUT HAVE YOU ANY IDEA HOW TO RAISE ELEVEN THOUSAND 
WELL NO BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO STICK A STUPID THERMOMETER OUTSIDE THE CHURCH FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
ADDING A NANOMETRE OF RED FELT TIP EVERY TIME SOMEBODY GIVES US TWO P. 
I WANT OUR CHURCH TO BE A CHURCH NOT A CHURCH SHAPED BEGGING BOWL 
I WANT PRINCESS ANNE TO KNOCK ON MY DOOR AND SAY I'VE DUMPED TIM LAWRENCE I'M ALL YOURS BIG BOY 
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IS IT 
WELL 
ENOUGH OF THIS 
IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME SOME OF US HAVE SOME WORK TO DO THANK YOU 
WHOO OOH WHOO WHO OOH OOH
