ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE PRIOR TO EVITA I WAS IN THE CHORUS OF JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR 
WHICH AGAIN WAS HIS SHOW AND THEN AND THEN I MANAGED TO GET THE LEAD 
I WAS IN THE CHORUS OF ONE SHOW AND THEN THE LEADING ROLE IN EVITA 
SO HE'S BEEN VERY MUCH PART OF 
HE WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE BEGINNING OF MY CAREER 
AND IT'S BEEN FANTASTIC A CAREER IN MUSIC AND THEATRE 
WHAT YOU DIDN'T REALISE OF COURSE IS THAT SHE REALLY WANTED TO BECOME A TENNIS PLAYER 
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT WELL I'VE SEEN YOU DOWN AT QUEENS LOVE

NOW THE RISOTTO'S VERY SIMPLE WE FRIED THE ONION 
WE FRIED THE RICE FIRST BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS NICE AND COATED WITH THE OIL 
THEN WE PUT A VEGETABLE CUBE INTO IT BOILING WATER 
WE STARTED TO COOK WITH PLENTY OF PARMESAN CHEESE 
THE MUSHROOM WENT IN THERE WITH THE BROCCOLI AT THE END A LITTLE KNOB OF BUTTER TO MAKE IT CREAMY YEAH 
WHAT'S THE CHESTNUT LIKE IN THERE IT'S DELICIOUS IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE THE DIFFERENT TEXTURES 
AND THE IMPORTANT THING IS PUT THE MUSHROOM AT THE END 
DON'T PUT THEM TOO EARLY OTHERWISE 
M. M. M. SO SUCCULENT
