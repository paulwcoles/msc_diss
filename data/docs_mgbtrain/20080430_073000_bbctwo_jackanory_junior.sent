AND QUICK AS THE WIND HE TURNED AND FLED 
ALL WAS QUIET IN THE DEEP DARK WOOD 
THE MOUSE FOUND A NUT 
AND THE NUT WAS GOOD 
THIS STORY IS ABOUT A NICE WITCH 
WHO HAD BIG PROBLEMS ON A STORMY DAY 
MIAOW THE WITCH HAD A CAT AND A VERY TALL HAT 
AND LONG GINGER HAIR 
WHICH SHE WORE IN A PLAIT 
HOW THE CAT PURRED AND HOW THE WITCH GRINNED 
AS THEY SAT ON THEIR BROOMSTICK AND FLEW THROUGH THE WIND 
BUT HOW THE WITCH WAILED AND HOW THE CAT SPAT 
WHEN THE WIND BLEW SO WILDLY IT BLEW OFF HER HAT 
DOWN CRIED THE WITCH AND THEY FLEW TO THE GROUND 
THEY SEARCHED FOR THE HAT BUT NO HAT COULD BE FOUND 
THEN OUT OF THE BUSHES ON THUNDERING PAWS 
THERE BOUNDED A DOG WITH THE HAT IN HIS JAWS 
HE DROPPED IT POLITELY THEN EAGERLY SAID 
AS THE WITCH PULLED THE HAT FIRMLY DOWN ON HER HEAD 
I'M A DOG AS KEEN AS CAN BE 
IS THERE ROOM ON THE BROOM FOR A DOG LIKE ME 
YES CRIED THE WITCH AND THE DOG CLAMBERED ON 
THE WITCH TAPPED THE BROOMSTICK AND WHOOSH THEY WERE GONE 
THE WITCH LAUGHED ALOUD AND HELD ON TO HER HAT 
BUT AWAY BLEW THE BOW FROM HER LONG GINGER PLAIT 
DOWN SAID THE WITCH AND THEY FLEW TO THE GROUND 
THEY SEARCHED FOR THE BOW BUT NO BOW COULD BE FOUND 
THEN OUT FROM A TREE WITH AN EAR SPLITTING SHRIEK 
THERE FLAPPED A GREEN BIRD WITH THE BOW IN HER BEAK 
SHE DROPPED IT POLITELY AND BENT HER HEAD LOW 
AND SAID AS THE WITCH TIED HER PLAIT IN A BOW 
I'M A BIRD AS GREEN AS CAN BE 
IS THERE ROOM ON THE BROOM FOR A BIRD LIKE ME 
YES CRIED THE WITCH SO THE BIRD FLUTTERED ON 
THE WITCH TAPPED THE BROOMSTICK AND WHOOSH THEY WERE GONE 
OVER THE REEDS AND THE RIVERS THEY FLEW 
THE BIRD SHRIEKED WITH GLEE AND THE STORMY WIND BLEW 
THEY SHOT THROUGH THE SKY TO THE BACK OF BEYOND 
THE WITCH CLUTCHED HER BOW BUT LET GO OF HER WAND 
DOWN CRIED THE WITCH AND THEY FLEW TO THE GROUND 
THEY SEARCHED FOR THE WAND BUT NO WAND COULD BE FOUND 
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN FROM OUT OF A POND 
LEAPT A DRIPPING WET FROG WITH A DRIPPING WET WAND 
HE DROPPED IT POLITELY THEN SAID WITH A CROAK 
AS THE WITCH DRIED THE WAND ON THE FOLD OF HER CLOAK 
RIBBET I'M A FROG AS CLEAN AS CAN BE 
IS THERE ROOM ON THE BROOM FOR A FROG LIKE ME 
YES CRIED THE WITCH SO THE FROG BOUNDED ON 
THE WITCH TAPPED THE BROOMSTICK AND WHOOSH THEY WERE GONE 
OVER THE MOORS AND THE MOUNTAINS THEY FLEW 
THE FROG JUMPED FOR JOY AND THE BROOM SNAPPED IN TWO 
DOWN FELL THE CAT AND THE DOG AND THE FROG 
DOWN THEY WENT TUMBLING INTO A BOG 
THE WITCH'S HALF BROOMSTICK FLEW INTO A CLOUD 
AND THE WITCH HEARD A ROAR THAT WAS SCARY AND LOUD 
I AM A DRAGON AS MEAN AS CAN BE 
AND I'M PLANNING TO HAVE WITCH AND CHIPS FOR MY TEA 
NO CRIED THE WITCH FLYING HIGHER AND HIGHER 
THE DRAGON FLEW AFTER HER BREATHING OUT FIRE 
HELP CRIED THE WITCH FLYING DOWN TO THE GROUND 
SHE LOOKED ALL AROUND BUT NO HELP COULD BE FOUND 
THE DRAGON DREW NEARER AND LICKING HIS LIPS SAID 
MAYBE THIS ONCE I'LL HAVE WITCH WITHOUT CHIPS 
BUT JUST AS HE PLANNED TO BEGIN ON HIS FEAST 
FROM OUT OF A DITCH ROSE A TERRIBLE BEAST 
IT WAS TALL DARK AND STICKY AND FEATHERED AND FURRED 
IT HAD FOUR FRIGHTFUL HEADS IT HAD WINGS LIKE A BIRD 
AND ITS TERRIBLE VOICE WHEN IT STARTED TO SPEAK 
WAS A YOWL AND A GROWL AND A CROAK AND A SHRIEK 
IT DRIPPED AND IT SQUELCHED AS IT STRODE FROM THE DITCH 
AND IT SAID TO THE DRAGON BUZZ OFF THAT'S MY WITCH 
THE DRAGON DREW BACK AND HE STARTED TO SHAKE 
I'M SORRY HE SPLUTTERED I'VE MADE A MISTAKE 
IT'S NICE TO HAVE MET YOU BUT NOW I MUST FLY 
AND HE SPREAD OUT HIS WINGS AND WAS OFF THROUGH THE SKY 
THEN DOWN FLEW THE BIRD AND DOWN JUMPED THE FROG 
DOWN CLIMBED THE CAT AND PHEW SAID THE DOG 
AND THANK YOU OH THANK YOU THE GRATEFUL WITCH CRIED 
WITHOUT YOU I'D BE IN THE DRAGON'S INSIDE 
THEN SHE FILLED UP HER CAULDRON AND SAID WITH A GRIN 
FIND SOMETHING EVERYONE THROW SOMETHING IN 
SO THE FROG FOUND A LILY THE CAT FOUND A CONE 
THE BIRD FOUND A TWIG AND THE DOG FOUND A BONE 
THEY THREW THEM IN AND THE WITCH STIRRED THEM WELL 
AND WHILE SHE WAS STIRRING SHE MUTTERED A SPELL 
ICKERTY ZICKERTY ZAGGERTY ZOOM 
THEN OUT ROSE A TRULY MAGNIFICENT BROOM 
WITH SEATS FOR THE WITCH AND THE CAT AND THE DOG 
A NEST FOR THE BIRD AND A SHOWER FOR THE FROG 
YES CRIED THE WITCH AND THEY ALL CLAMBERED ON 
THE WITCH TAPPED THE BROOMSTICK AND WHOOSH THEY WERE GONE 
AND IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO TOO 
WATCH OUT FOR WITCHES 
SEE YOU SOON BYE BYE
