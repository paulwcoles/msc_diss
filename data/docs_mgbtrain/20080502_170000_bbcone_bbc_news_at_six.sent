THEY LOSE HUNDREDS OF COUNCIL SEATS 
AS THEY ARE PUSHED INTO THIRD PLACE 
BEHIND THE LIB DEMS JUBILATION FOR 
THE CONSERVATIVES WHO TAKE A 
MASSIVE FORTY FOUR PER CENT OF THE VOTE WAY AHEAD 
OF LABOUR 
THESE RESULTS ARE NOT 
JUST A VOTE AGAINST GORDON BROWN 
AND HIS GOVERNMENT THEY ARE A VOTE 
OF POSITIVE CONFIDENCE IN THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
IT IS CLEAR 
THAT THIS HAS BEEN A DISAPPOINTING 
NIGHT A BAD NIGHT FOR LABOUR WE 
HAVE LESSONS TO LEARN FROM THAT AND 
THEN WE'LL MOVE FORWARD 
TONIGHT'S OTHER STORIES 
TWO MEN ARE FOUND GUILTY OF A GAY 
SEX BLACKMAIL PLOT AGAINST A MEMBER 
OF THE ROYAL FAMILY 
AND THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
RESULTS ARE DECLARED IN ZIMBABWE 
BUT THERE'S NO OUTRIGHT WINNER 
AND B. B. C. LONDON 
HAS BORIS JOHNSON CLINCHED IT WE 
ARE LIVE AT CITY HALL AS LABOUR 
FEARS KEN LIVINGSTONE'S REIGN AS 
MAYOR MAY BE OVER 
IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE CRUCIAL 
COUNTS TAKING PLACE NOW 
GOOD EVENING FROM CITY HALL WHERE 
THE COUNTING IS STILL GOING ON IN 
THE CONTEST FOR MAYOR OF LONDON IT 
HAS BEEN A TERRIBLE DAY FOR LABOUR 
RIGHT ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES 
AFTER YESTERDAY'S LOCAL ELECTIONS 
AND AS THINGS STAND IT IS NOT 
LOOKING GOOD FOR LABOUR'S KEN 
LIVINGSTONE THE CURRENT MAYOR WHO 
IS FACING DEFEAT AT THE HANDS OF 
BORIS JOHNSON AND THE CONSERVATIVES 
ALL OF WHICH MEANS THAT GORDON 
BROWN IN HIS FIRST BIG ELECTORAL 
TEST AS PRIME MINISTER HAS LED 
LABOUR TO ITS WORST LOCAL RESULTS 
FOR AROUND FORTY YEARS THIS IS THE 
SCALE OF THE CONSERVATIVE VICTORY 
THEY HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SIX EXTRA COUNCILLORS 
LABOUR ENDED UP WITH A THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE FEWER 
COUNCILLORS AND THE LIB DEMS 
GAINED THIRTY FOUR SEATS MORE STRIKING 
PERHAPS IS THE SHARE OF THE VOTE 
THE CONSERVATIVES TOOK FORTY FOUR PER CENT OF THE 
VOTES CAST LABOUR WERE WAY BEHIND 
ON TWENTY FOUR PER CENT FORCED INTO THIRD PLACE BY 
THE LIB DEMS WHO WON TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
ACCORDING TO OUR PROJECTIONS LAURA 
KEUNSSBERG HAS THE LATEST 
THE LABOUR PARTY CANDIDATE SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE A A QUIET ANNOUNCEMENT A DRAMATIC 
RESULT NUNEATON TOWN COUNCIL IS 
TORY AFTER THIRTY FOUR YEARS GORDON BROWN 
THIS MORNING COULD NOT PRETEND IT 
WAS ANY DIFFERENT 
IT IS CLEAR THIS 
HAS BEEN A DISAPPOINTING NIGHT 
INDEED A BAD NIGHT FOR LABOUR WE 
HAVE LESSONS TO LEARN FROM THAT AND 
THEN WE WILL MOVE FORWARD MY JOB 
IS TO LISTEN AND TO LEAD AND THAT 
IS WHAT I WILL DO 
LABOUR IS NOW 
CONFRONTED WITH A MORE HOSTILE 
POLITICAL MAP IT LOST NUNEATON 
SUPPORT IN MIDDLE ENGLAND CRUMBLING 
READING HAS GONE TOO THE ONLY 
COUNCIL HELD IN THE SOUTH EAST 
OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL AND DEFEAT 
AFTER DEFEAT IN WALES IN AREAS FOR 
DECADES SOLIDLY LABOUR IN STEPPED 
THE CONSERVATIVES DAVID CAMERON 
CLOCKING UP VICTORIES IN WALES AND 
ACROSS MUCH OF ENGLAND HIS PARTY 
GAINING CONTROL OF TWELVE NEW COUNCILS 
SO FAR 
WHO HAS HAD SOME SLEEP HE HE MAY NOT HAVE HAD MUCH SLEEP LAST 
NIGHT BUT WITH THESE RESULTS HE 
DID NOT NEED TO DREAM OF 
THEY SAID 
WE COULD NOT WIN IN THE NORTH OF 
ENGLAND AND IN BURY YOU HAVE SHOWN 
THE WAY WE HAVE NOT WON AT BURY 
SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AND IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT 
CAMPAIGN 
THERE WAS SURPRISE IN CAMPAIGN SOUTHAMPTON THE CONSERVATIVES 
TAKING CONTROL FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IN YEARS THE PARTY ALSO SHOWED IT 
CAN WIN IN TRADITIONAL LABOUR 
PLACES LIKE BURY IN LANCASHIRE AND 
FURTHER NORTH SUGGESTIONS THE 
TORIES COULD BE WELCOMED IN AREAS 
LIKE TYNESIDE THE LABOUR PARTY HAS 
NOT PERFORMED SO BADLY IN COUNCIL 
ELECTIONS FOR FOUR DECADES BACK 
THEN HOW WOULD HAROLD WILSON WAS 
IN NUMBER TEN TWO YEARS LATER HE 
WAS OUT OF DOWNING STREET AND 
LABOUR WERE OUT OF POWER IF THESE 
RESULTS WERE TRANSLATED INTO THE 
NATIONAL PICTURE AT THE NEXT 
GENERAL ELECTION THE CONSERVATIVES 
WOULD TAKE FORTY FOUR PER CENT OF THE VOTE LEAVING 
LABOUR TRAILING THEM BY TWENTY POINTS 
WITH JUST TWENTY FOUR PER CENT 
IF WE SIMPLY TAKE 
THE RESULTS TONIGHT AND TRANSLATE 
THEM DIRECTLY INTO A GENERAL 
ELECTION WE WOULD BE LOOKING THE 
CONSERVATIVES WOULD BE WINNING 
SOMETHING LIKE A PARLIAMENTARY 
MAJORITY OF ONE HUNDRED TO THAT DEGREE IT 
IS GOOD NEWS FOR THE CONSERVATIVES 
WE SHOULD BEAR IN MIND THOUGH 
THAT PEOPLE DO NOT NECESSARILY VOTE 
IN LOCAL ELECTIONS IN THE WAY THEY 
WOULD AT EIGHT GENERAL ELECTION 
LABOUR WAS NOT JUST BEHIND THE 
CONSERVATIVES IF THIS HAD BEEN A 
GENERAL ELECTION THEY WOULD HAVE 
BEEN THIRD BEHIND THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS WHOSE PROJECTED SHARE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN TWENTY FIVE PER CENT THEIR SUPPORT 
CAME IN PLACES LIKE SAINT ALBANS THE 
LIB DEMS CELEBRATED TAKING CONTROL 
IN THEIR FIRST TEST UNDER NICK 
CLEGG'S LEADERSHIP THEY GAINED 
NEARLY THIRTY SEATS BUT PROJECTING THE 
RESULT INTO A GENERAL ELECTION 
THEIR SHARE WAS SLIGHTLY DOWN THE 
PARTY ONCE KINGSTON UPON HULL 
COUNCIL FROM NO OVERALL CONTROL A 
SIMILAR VICTORY FOLLOWED IN 
SHEFFIELD ON NICK CLEGG'S HOME 
TURF BUT THEY LOST OUT IN THE 
NORTH WEST IN PENDLE 
WE HAVE ONE 
MORE COUNCILS UP AND DOWN THE 
COUNTRY I HAVE BEEN READING FOR 
WEEKS THAT WE WOULD BE DOING WELL 
IF WE LOST UP TO FIFTY COUNCILS WE 
HAVE MORE COUNCILLORS AND WE ARE 
WINNING AGAINST LABOUR IN THEIR 
URBAN HEARTLANDS AND AGAINST THE 
CONSERVATIVES IN SAINT ALBANS 
OXFORDSHIRE COLCHESTER 
IN LONDON 
LABOUR'S MAVERICK IS NEARLY CERTAIN 
TO BE PUSHED OUT BY THE 
CONSERVATIVE'S OWN BIG CHARACTER 
WITH EVERY MINUTE THE WAITING IS 
MORE GRIM FOR KEN LIVINGSTONE BUT 
IT IS GORDON BROWN WHO HAS BEEN HIT 
HE IS PROMISING NOW TO LEAD AND 
LISTEN BUT HE MIGHT NOT LIKE WHAT 
HE HEARS 
SOME OF LABOUR'S BIGGEST LOSSES 
WERE IN THE HEARTLANDS OF SOUTH 
WALES AND IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
IN WALES THEY LOST THE FORMER 
STRONGHOLDS OF BLAENAU GWENT AND 
TORFAEN AND IN THE NORTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWENTY TWO 
YEARS THE CONSERVATIVES GAINED 
BURY FROM LABOUR PARTY MEMBERS ARE 
ALREADY DEBATING WHAT DROVE THE 
VOTE AS A WAVE IN A MOMENT JO 
COBURN WHO HAS BEEN TALKING TO 
VOTERS IN BURY FIRST WYRE DAVIES 
REPORTS FROM EBBW VALE 
DOZENS OF BALLOT BOXES COST 
ARRIVING TO BE COUNTED AT A BAIL 
MEASURES UNTIL LAST NIGHT NORMALLY 
A STRAIGHTFORWARD PROCESS WHERE 
LOTS OF LABOUR CANDIDATES ARE 
RETURN WITH BIG MAJORITIES EBBW 
VALE BACK TO NORMAL AT THE LEISURE 
CENTRE TODAY AND SOME OF THE MANY 
VOTERS FROM THIS TRADITIONAL LABOUR 
HEARTLAND WHO ABANDONED THE PARTY 
THIS TIME TOLD US WHY FED UP WITH 
GOING NOWHERE FAST INACTION AND 
THEY SAY HOLLOW PROMISES PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY STRUGGLING WITH THE 
COST OF LIVING IT IS GETTING OUT 
OF PROPORTION TO WHAT WE EARN 
THERE ARE NO JOBS HERE AT ALL 
THERE ARE A LOT OF WORKING CLASS 
PEOPLE SUFFERING AND WE WANT A 
CHANGE 
LABOUR'S LEADER IN WALES CHANGE ADMITS IT WILL TAKE A BIG EFFORT TO 
WIN VOTERS BACK BUT SAYS THE BLAME 
IS NOT ENTIRELY HIS 
IT IS A MID 
TERM VERDICT ON LABOUR GENERALLY 
IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU 
CONSIDERED TO BE LABOUR BLAIR AND 
BROWN IT DOES NOT MATTER REALLY 
IT IS JUST THAT WE OTHER PARTY IN 
AUTHORITY AND WE HAVE BEEN IN FOR A 
LONG TIME 
THERE WERE ALSO STRONG 
LOCAL ISSUES IN THE CAMPAIGN ACROSS 
WALES THE CLOSURE OF SMALL SCHOOLS 
IN RURAL AREAS WAS A PARTICULARLY 
VOCAL TOPICS COUNCILLORS FROM 
NORTH TO SOUTH HAVE ALSO HAD TO 
JUSTIFY CONTROVERSIAL AND UNPOPULAR 
REFUSE COLLECTION POLICIES THAT 
MIGHT PARTLY EXPLAIN LABOUR'S POOR 
PERFORMANCE AND THAT OF PLAID 
CYMRU ITS COALITION PARTNER IN THE 
WELSH ASSEMBLY GOVERNMENT 
IT WAS 
NOTHING TO DO IT SEEMS TO ME WITH 
THE SITUATION IN THE ASSEMBLY THIS 
WAS A VERDICT ON GORDON BROWN 
THESE VALLEYS ONCE SOLIDLY LABOUR 
ARE NOW A MURKY COALITION GREY FOR 
THE TIME BEING THE POLITICAL MAP 
OF WALES IS POLITICAL IS 
REMARKABLY DIFFERENT 
A POIGNANT SCENE FOR DAVID 
CAMERON'S ARRIVAL IN THE NORTH 
UNDER THE WATCHFUL GAZE OF SIR 
ROBERT PEEL FOUNDER OF THE MODERN 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND BURY'S MOST 
FAMOUS SON 
THEY SAID WE COULD NOT 
WIN IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND 
YOU HAVE SHOWN THE WAY IN BURY IT IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING BUT 
AFTER TWENTY TWO YEARS THE TORIES HAVE A 
FOOTHOLD IN A TOWN FAMOUS FOR ITS 
OPEN AIR MARKET AND BLACK PUDDING 
WE BE TAKING BLACK PUDDING HOME I I DON'T THINK I'VE GOT TIME THE THE RESULT MAY INDICATE A CHANGE IN 
POLITICAL TASTES HERE BUT IS THERE 
AN APPETITE FOR WHAT DAVID 
CAMERON'S CONSERVATIVES HAVE TO 
OFFER OR IS IT THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
GONE OFF LABOUR MARKET TRADERS 
GAVE THEIR VERDICT 
IT IS NOT ABOUT 
PARTIES OR WHAT THEY ARE PROMISING 
WHAT WE SEE IS SOMEBODY WHO IS 
APPROACHABLE WHO HAS GOT SOME 
CHARISMA AGAINST A MAN WHO IS 
BURIED HOUR 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE 
THE TORIES 
I AM OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE 
SERVED UNDER THE CONSERVATIVES SO 
I AM APPREHENSIVE ABOUT THE TORIES' 
COMING IN 
WHEN HE FIRST CAME IN 
CHARGE OF THE CONSERVATIVES IT 
MADE ME GO AND VOTE BECAUSE I 
THOUGHT HE COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
BURY IS ONE OF THOSE BELLWETHER 
TOWNS KNOWN TO RETURN M. P.'S FROM THE 
PARTY OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY 
THE FACT THAT THE TORIES HAVE WON 
THE COUNCIL HERE COULD SEND A 
CHILLING MESSAGE TO NUMBER 
SO WE HAVE HAD THE PICTURE IN THE 
NORTH OF ENGLAND AND SOUTH WALES 
WHAT ABOUT LONDON WHO WILL BE 
RUNNING THIS CITY FOR THE NEXT FOUR 
YEARS WILL IT BE KEN LIVINGSTONE 
AGAIN OR THE CONSERVATIVE BORIS 
JOHNSON WHO IS DOING VERY WELL 
ACCORDING TO THE LATEST REPORTS ON 
THE COUNT WE DO NOT EXPECT FINAL 
RESULT FOR ANOTHER COUPLE OF HOURS 
MAYBE LONGER BUT WE DO KNOW THAT 
THE TURNOUT HAS BEEN RELATIVELY 
HIGH AFTER A VERY HIGH PROFILE 
CAMPAIGN JAMES LANDALE IS 
MONITORING THE COUNT FOR US WHAT 
IS THE LATEST 
THE LATEST IS A VERY 
HIGH TURNOUT OF ABOUT FORTY FIVE PER CENT WILL 
STOCK A GOOD THREE QUARTERS OF THE 
VOTES HAVE NOW BEEN COUNTED THEY 
ARE COMING UP IN PROPORTIONATE 
TERMS ON THE SCREEN BEHIND ME IN 
THE VAST MAJORITY OF CONSTITUENCIES 
THROUGHOUT LONDON BORIS JOHNSON IS 
AHEAD IN THE COUNT OF THOSE FIRST 
PREFERENCE VOTES OBVIOUSLY THERE 
ARE MORE VOTES TO BE COUNTED BUT 
THERE ARE NOT MANY AROUND HERE WHO 
ARE PREDICTING A KEN LIVINGSTONE 
WIN WIN THE LATEST THAT WE HAVE IS THAT THE 
RESULT COULD BE AS LATE AS TEN P. M. 
NICK ROBINSON IS WITH ME NOW AND 
HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THINGS 
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AND THE DAY 
THE FIRST THING TO ASK IS WE ARE 
MAKING BIG DEAL OF THESE LOCAL 
RESULTS BUT SHOULD WE BE READING 
AS MUCH INTO THEM 
I THINK WE CAN 
BECAUSE UP AND DOWN THE LAND 
SOMETIMES IT WILL BE THE BINS 
SOMETIMES THE COUNCIL TAX THAT 
WILL EXPLAIN WHY LABOUR DOES BETTER 
HERE AND WORSE THERE BUT THEY HAVE 
GONE DREADFULLY EVERYWHERE AND THE 
TORIES HAVE DONE WELL PRETTY MUCH 
EVERYWHERE THAT IS WHY THIS IS SO 
SERIOUS IT MEANS THAT FOR ONCE 
IT IS NOT ONE OF THOSE TIMES WHEN 
YOU HAVE TO SPIN THE RESULTS WHEN 
THE GOVERNMENT CAN SAY LET'S LOOK 
AT DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS ONE 
TEST OF THAT IS THAT GORDON BROWN 
PROMISED TO RENEW HIS PARTY AS A 
NEW LEADER AND HE IS DOING WORSE 
THAN HIS PREDECESSOR TONY BLAIR 
EVEN WHEN THE PUBLIC HAD MADE CLEAR 
THEY HAD HAD ENOUGH OF TONY BLAIR 
AND HIS WAR THAT HAD GONE SO BADLY 
WRONG 
SO HOW DOES HE COPE WITH WRONG WHAT IS PROBABLY INEVITABLE LABOUR 
M. P.'S THINKING IS THIS THE MAN WE 
WANT TO LEAD US INTO THE NEXT 
GENERAL ELECTION 
HE COPES BECAUSE 
HE HOPES HE HAS ALREADY HAD HIS 
LEADERSHIP CRISIS OVER THE TEN PENCE 
TAX RATE THAT WAS WHEN LABOUR M. P.'S 
COULD HAVE SAID YOU HAVE GOT TO GO 
HE TRIED TO PRE EMPT THAT BY 
LISTENING AND CHANGING HE IS NOW 
OPENLY I'M TOLD IN PRIVATE 
COMPARING HIMSELF WITH JOHN MAJOR 
THE DEFEATED TORY PRIME MINISTER 
BUT NOT WITH THE DEFEAT BUT THE 
MOMENT WHEN JOHN MAJOR HELD OFF 
DEFEAT WHEN HE FIRST FACED THE 
ELECTORATE HE IS SAYING YES YOU 
MIGHT LIKE THE CHARISMA OF DAVID 
CAMERON BUT WHEN YOU HAVE TO 
CHOOSE BETWEEN US AND OUR POLICIES 
I BELIEVE YOU WILL STICK WITH ME 
RATHER THAN TAKE THE RISK OF GOING 
WITH HIM IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLL 
EVIDENCE OF TODAY AND THAT WILL BE 
REINFORCED I SUSPECT WITH THE 
LONDON RESULTS TONIGHT HE LOOKS 
LIKE JOHN MAJOR IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE FACING 
DEFEAT NOT LIKE THE JOHN MAJOR OF 
NINETEEN NINETY TWO LOOKING FORWARD TO A NARROW 
SQUEAK OF A VICTORY 
WE WILL HAVE A 
WORD WITH YOU LATER THANK YOU

OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT LABOUR HAS

RESULT FOR FORTY YEARS AND NOT 
LOOKING GOOD FOR KEN LIVINGSTONE 
WHO IS FACING DEFEAT FROM THE 
CONSERVATIVE'S BORIS JOHNSON AND 
COMING UP BRITISH BLUBELLS ARE 
THEY UNDER THREAT FROM A SPANISH 
INVASION IT LAER ON B. B. C. LONDON 
NEWS A CHANCE FOR YOU TO WORK 
WITH THE ANONYMOUS GRAFFITTI ARTIST 
BANKSY AS HE UNVEILS AN EXHIBITION 
IN AN UNUSED TUNNEL 
TOMORROW MARKS THE FIRST 
ANNIVERSARY SINCE FOUR YEAR OLD 
MADELEINE MCCANN DISAPPEARED SHE 
WENT MISSING WHILE ON HOLIDAY WITH 
HER FAMILY IN PORTUGAL TWELVE MONTHS 
ON THERE IS NO ED OF WHAT HAPPENED 
TO THE LITTLE GIRL POLICE AND A 
DETECTIVE AGENCY HAVE BEEN 
INVESTIGATING THE DISAPPEARANCE 
WHAT IF ANY PROGRESS HAS BEEN 
MADE MADE IMAGES THAT ARE PART OF ALL OF OUR 
LIVES THE INVESTIGATION THE 
ACCUSATIONS IT HAS BEEN GOING ON 
FOR A YEAR BUT WHAT OF THOSE AT 
THE HEART OF THE SEARCH FOR 
MADELEINE MCCANN WELL HER PARENTS 
ARE STILL SUSPECTS AND STILL IN THE 
PUBLIC EYE THEY SPENT THE LAST 
MONTH CAMPAIGNING FOR MADELEINE AND 
FOR ALL MISSING CHILDREN THEIR ON 
GOING HORROR IS SHARED WITH THE 
NATION THEY LOATH THE INTRUSION OF 
THE MEDIA BUT STILL THINK IT MIGHT 
BE THE BEST WAY OF BRINGING THEIR 
DAUGHTER BACK 
IT IS PRETTY MUCH A 
DAY BY DAY WEEK BY WEEK TO BE 
HONEST WE DON'T LOOK TOO FAR AHEAD 
REALLY NOW WE HAVE GOT TO THIS 
POINT WE NEED TO USE THAT 
OPPORTUNITY I GUESS TO FOCUS ON 
WHAT IS IMPORTANT WHICH IS 
MADELEINE 
WHAT OF THE OTHER MADELEINE SUSPECTS ROBERT MURAT VILIFIED IN 
THE MEDIA HE IS SUING THIRTEEN 
PUBLISHERS HE HAS ALLOWED THE B. B. C. 
TO FILM HIM BUT DOES NOT SPEAK TO 
THE MEDIA HIS FAMILY SAY HE WANTS 
HIS LIFE BACK 
HE JUST WANTS HIS 
NAME CLEARED HE WANTS AN APOLOGY 
FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED REALLY SO HE 
CAN CARRY ON WITH HIS LIFE HE 
NEVER HAD A SINGLE THING TO DO WITH 
THAT 
SO EVERYTHING COMES BACK TO THAT THE POLICE CRITICISED IN THE EARLY 
STAGES DETECTIVES CAME TO THE U. K. 
LAST MONTH TO OVERSEE FRESH WITNESS 
INTERVIEWS BUT PORTUGUESE 
DETECTIVES CAN FEEL THE PRESSURE 
HERE AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF 
PORTUGAL'S DETECTIVE FORCE IN 
LISBON THE MADELEINE MCCANN CASE 
LOOMS LARGE BECAUSE IT IS FROM 
HERE THAT THE INVESTIGATION HAS 
BEEN CO ORDINATED IT IS ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST INVESTIGATIONS IN 
PORTUGUESE HISTORY YET A YEAR 
SINCE IT BEGAN THERE HAS BEEN NO 
BREAK THROUGH EVEN IN LEGAL 
CIRCLES HERE SOME SAY THAT IS NOT 
GOOD ENOUGH 
THIS MAN CHAIRS THE PORTUGUESE 
LAWYERS' ASSOCIATION 
HE SAYS A YEAR IS TOO LONG GOOD 
OR BAD IT IS URGENT WE KNOW THE 
STATE OF THE POLICE INQUIRY SO 
WHAT OF MADELEINE A YEAR AGO 
TONIGHT WAS HER LAST NORMAL NIGHT 
WITH HER FAMILY WE ALL NOW KNOW 
HER FACE BUT WE STILL HAVE NO IDEA 
WHERE SHE IS 
THE QUARTET OF MIDDLE EAST PEACE 
NEGOTIATORS SAY CONDITIONS NEED TO 
BE IMPROVED URGENTLY THEY 
CONDEMNED RECENT VIOLENCE AND 
CALLED ON ISRAEL TO STOP BUILDING 
SETTLEMENTS THE MEETING DEMANDED 
THAT PALESTINIANS TACKLE TERRORISM 
HERE HEAD TEACHERS ARE CALLING FOR 
MORE CLARITY OVER THE INTRODUCTION 
OF DIPLOMAS IN ENGLAND THE NEW 
QUALIFICATIONS WILL BE TAUGHT 
ALONGSIDE GCSES AND A LEVELS THE 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HEAD 
TEACHERS HAVE RAISED CONCERNS SUCH 
AS THE LACK OF TRAINING FOR 
TEACHERS AND THE DIFFICULTY OF 
VETTING EMPLOYERS OFFERING WORK 
EXPERIENCE ELECTION OFFICIALS IN 
ZIMBABWE HAVE AT LAST RELEASED 
RESULTS FROM THE COUNTRY'S 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS OVER A MONTH 
AGO THEY CLAIMED THE OPPOSITION 
LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI WON THE 
MAJORITY OF VOTES BUT NOT ENOUGH 
FOR AN OUTRIGHT VICTORY PAVING THE 
WAY FOR A RUN OFF WITH PRESIDENT 
MUGABE THEY ARE DISPUTING THAT 
SAYING THE ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN 
RIGGED THE B. B. C. IS BANNED FROM 
ZIMBABWE BUT WE CAN SPEAK TO OUR 
CORRESPONDENT IN JOHANNESBURG SO 
WHAT HAPPENS NOW 
WELL THE 
OPPOSITION IS STILL MAINTAINING 
THAT THE ELECTION HAS BEEN STOLEN 
FROM IT IT IS TALKING OF GOING TO 
THE COURTS TO GET MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
DECLARED THE VICTOR AND THE 
PRESIDENT THEN THERE IS THE OPTION 
OF GOING FOR THIS PRESIDENTIAL RE 
RUN THAT IS SOMETHING THE 
OPPOSITION DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO 
DO BUT THE TALK TONIGHT FROM THE 
OPPOSITION IS OF A GOVERNMENT OF 
WHAT THEY CALL NATIONAL HEELING 
SO LONG AS ROBERT MUGABE IS NOT 
PART OF IT THEY SAID THEY WOULD 
GUARANTEE HIS SAFETY ASSETS AND 
RIGHT TO STAY IN ZIMBABWE FRANKLY 
TONIGHT THERE IS NO SUGGESTION THAT 
ROBERT MUGABE IS LIKELY TO 
RELINQUISH POWER 
REPORTS ARE 
SAYING THAT HE WANTS TO GO FOR A 
RUN OFF IF THAT TAKES PLACE WHAT 
GUARANTEES IF ANY ARE THERE THAT 
IT WOULD BE FAIR 
THIS IS THE REAL 
CONCERN THE OPPOSITION IS SAYING 
THAT AT THE MOMENT UNDER CURRENT 
CONDITIONS THERE COULD NOT BE A 
LEGITIMATE VOTE THERE HAS BEEN A 
CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE AGAINST 
OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS AND ACTIVISTS 
THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE 
SAY ITS STRUCTURES HAVE BEEN 
DECIMATED IT IS VERY DIFFICULT AT 
THE MOMENT HOWEVER FOR THE 
MOVEMENT OF DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IT 
IS IN A QUAN DRI THAT IT 
EFFECTIVELY HANDS ROBERT MUGABE A 
VICTORY I THINK THEY WILL BE 
THINKING LONG AND HARD OVER THE 
WEEKEND ABOUT WHAT THEIR STRATEGY 
SHOULD BE 
THANK YOU

INSOLVENT IN ENGLAND AND WALES HAS

ITS VIGOROUS SPANISH COUSIN THIS 
WOOD IS DOMINATED BY THE BRITISH 
BLUBELL IN SOME AREAS THE SPANISH 
VARIETY HAS SPREAD OVER THE PAST 
ONE HUNDRED YEARS THAT IS THREATENING THE 
PURITY OF OUR NATIVE FLOWER THE 
TWO ARE CROSSING AND PRODUCING A 
HYBRID NOW BOTANISTS WANT PEOPLE 
TO BUILD AN ARCHIVE OF WHAT THEY 
ARE FINDING 
THE OUTLINE IS SIDE 
STRAIGHTED THEY ARE OFTEN DARK
