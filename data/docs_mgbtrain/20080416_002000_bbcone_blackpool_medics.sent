BLACKPOOL ONE OF THE TEN MOST POPULAR TOURIST SPOTS IN THE WORLD 
LAST SUMMER THE B. B. C. WAS GRANTED EXCLUSIVE ACCESS 
TO THE REGION'S AMBULANCE CREWS AND TO BLACKPOOL VICTORIA HOSPITAL ONE OF THE BUSIEST IN THE COUNTRY 
SIX MONTHS LATER WE'RE BACK TO SEE HOW OUR BLACKPOOL MEDICS COPE 
WITH THE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES THAT WINTER BRINGS 
TONIGHT TOO MUCH BLOOD CAN KILL YOU 
ALICE SELBY'S LIFE THREATENING CONDITION 
I WOULDN'T BE HERE IF IT WASN'T FOR THEM 
EVERY DAY'S A BONUS 
WE MEET THE COUPLE HOPING THE SURGEON'S KNIFE WILL SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS IN THE BEDROOM 
THIS IS WHERE MARK SLEPT MOST OF THE NIGHT AND AS YOU CAN HEAR 
AND MARY SAUNDERS SUBMITS TO A MORE HANDS ON APPROACH BY HER CONSULTANT 
IN THE YEAR OF ITS SIXTIETH BIRTHDAY THIS IS THE N. H. S. THROUGH THE EYES OF THE MEDICS 
WHOSE JOB IT IS TO KEEP THE NATION HEALTHY AND TO SAVE LIVES TWENTY FOUR SEVENTHS 
JUST OPEN YOUR EYES FOR ME 
TURN YOUR HEAD THIS WAY SWEETHEART JUST GIVING YOU SOME OXYGEN O. K. STEVEN 
THE PEAK TOURIST SEASON MAY HAVE COME TO AN END BUT THERE'S STILL THE LOCAL POPULATION TO SERVE 
THE NORTHWEST HAS THE HIGHEST RATE OF CANCER RELATED DEATHS IN ENGLAND AND WALES 
SOMETHING THAT IMPACTS DIRECTLY ON THE WORKLOAD 
OF EAR NOSE AND THROAT SURGEON AJAY NIGAM 
HIS MOST DEMANDING AND COMPLEX OPERATION OF THE WEEK 
WILL BE HIS THROAT CANCER SURGERY ON SEVENTY THREE YEAR OLD BRIAN 
THE CANCER IS MASSIVE IT EXTENDS FROM THE TONGUE 
IT'S GONE THROUGH THE FOOD PASSAGE AND IS SITTING IN THE NECK 
AND IT'S GONE THROUGH THE SKIN AS WELL NOW 
IT'S A MASSIVE TUMOUR 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO GIVE HIM STRENGTH HE HAS TO KNOW WE'LL LOOK AFTER HIM WELL 
MR. NIGAM HAS TO REMOVE BRIAN'S LARYNX AS PART OF THE PROCEDURE 
AND NEEDS TO ENSURE HIS PATIENT IS STRONG ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND SUCH MAJOR SURGERY 
RIGHT IT HAS RUPTURED HASN'T IT 
WHAT CAN I SAY I'VE NO ALTERNATIVE 
I'VE GOT TO TAKE THIS SHOT I'VE NO ALTERNATIVE AT ALL 
AND MR. NIGAM SEEMS TO THINK IT'S GOT A GOOD OUTCOME 
SO THAT'S A MODEL OF THE LARYNX 
THAT'S THE VOICE BOX SO YOUR VOICE BOX COMES OUT COMPLETELY AND THE FOOD PASSAGE ALSO BEHIND IT 
IT IS COMPLEX BUT WE'VE DONE IT A FEW TIMES AND HOPING YOU SHOULD ALL RIGHT 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE LARYNX TAKEN OUT LOSE THE ABILITY TO SNIFF AIR INTO THEIR NOSE TO SMELL 
SO HE MAY NOT ENJOY HIS FOOD AS MUCH AS HE IS DOING NOW BCCAUSE IF YOU CAN'T SMELL YOUR FOOD 
YOU DON'T ENJOY IT SO MUCH YOU THINK YOUR TASTE IS GONE EVEN THOUGH IT'S NORMAL 
CONSIDERING THE DISEASE THAT HE HAS THAT IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY 
I KNOW I'M IN GOOD HANDS I'LL TELL YOU THAT 
NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT 
I SHALL SEE YOU TOMORROW THANK YOU NOT AT ALL 
I DON'T FEEL TOO NERVOUS AT ALL 
BRIAN KNOWS THAT IF HE IS TO SURVIVE HIS CANCER HE NEEDS TO HAVE THIS OPERATION 
HE IS HAPPY TO PUT HIS LIFE IN MR. NIGAM'S HANDS 
IF YOU GO BY NATIONAL FIGURES THEN YOU MIGHT LOSE ONE OUT OF SIX PATIENTS 
HAVING SAID THAT WE'VE BEEN EXTREMELY FORTUNATE 
WE HAVEN'T LOST ANYBODY WITHIN 
TWO OR THREE WEEKS OF THIS OPERATION IN THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN DOING IT 
THE AMBULANCE SERVICE COVERS THREE HUNDRED SQUARE MILES OF THE FYLDE COAST 
SERVING A LOCAL POPULATION OF THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
ANY DOWNTIME IS THE EXCEPTION RATHER THAN THE RULE DID SOMEONE SAY BREW 
NO OH JUST THOUGHT 
I'D LIKE TO SAY THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME WAS SPENT HERE BUT IT'S THAT BUSY WE'RE OUT ALL THE TIME ANYWAY 
BUT WHEN WE DON'T HAVE JOBS YEAH WE STAY HERE 
AND IF THERE'S OTHER VEHICLES ON BASE THEN WE SEE OUR COLLEAGUES AND CATCH UP 
SO IT'S QUITE NICE AT TIMES WHEN IT'S A QUIET DAY 
BUT TODAY ISN'T A QUIET DAY 
MICK NAYLOR AND CLARE ALGIE ARE SOON ON THEIR WAY TO THEIR NEXT JOB 
EVEN IN MID NOVEMBER THERE ARE STILL PLENTY OF VISITORS TO KEEP THE LOCAL HOTELS BUSY 
AND KEEP BLACKPOOL'S AMBULANCE SERVICE BUSY AS WELL 
WE'VE BEEN CALLED TO THE SAVOY HOTEL 
APPARENTLY THERE'S BEEN A FEMALE THERE UNABLE TO WALK 
POSSIBLY DUE TO A DISLOCATED KNEECAP 
AFTER LEAVING THE AMBULANCE THE PARAMEDICS ARE FACED 
WITH A FURTHER JOURNEY ON FOOT DOWN THE LONG HOTEL CORRIDORS 
NOTHING LIKE A LONG CORRIDOR 
I'M GOING TO GET LOST 
HELLO SIR BY YOU'VE DONE WELL LAD LISTEN 
WHAT'S YOUR NAME JENNY JENNY 
DOES THAT HURT NOT BAD IT'S PAINFUL BUT YOU'RE NOT HURTING ME 
LEEDS COUPLE JENNY AND ERNIE KIDD ARE IN BLACKPOOL ON WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A DANCING HOLIDAY 
JUST HOURS AFTER ARRIVING JENNY HAS FALLEN OVER BADLY INJURING HER KNEE 
IF IT'S GOT TO COME OFF TELL ME 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT HAVE JUST POPPED OUT AND DISLOCATED 
HAVE YOU EVER HAD GAS AND AIR 
FOR MY FIRST BABY RIGHT 
WELL THAT WAS ONLY TWO YEARS AGO 
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME MORE GAS AND AIR 
YOU DO THIS YOURSELF CHICK 
YOU WANT ME TO YEAH PUT THAT IN MY MOUTH AND CLAMP MY MOUTH SHUT 
AND DON'T TALK AND JUST BREATH NORMALLY 
IN THROUGH YOUR MOUTH OUT THROUGH YOUR NOSE 
THE TEAM DECIDE TO PUT AN INFLATABLE SPLINT AROUND JENNY'S LEG BEFORE THEY CAN MOVE HER 
GOOD GIRL THAT'S IT THAT'S IT 
AND SINCE SHE NOW WON'T FIT INTO THE HOTEL'S LIFT MICK AND CLARE HAVE TO CARRY HER DOWN TO THE AMBULANCE 
A VISIT TO A AND AMP E. WILL REVEAL WHETHER JENNY'S PLANS FOR A DANCING HOLIDAY HAVE COME TO A PREMATURE END 
BLACKPOOL VICTORIA'S HAEMATOLOGY UNIT PLAYS A CENTRAL ROLE 
IN THE PROVISION OF BLOOD SERVICES FOR THE WHOLE HOSPITAL 
PREPARING BLOOD FOR ONE THOUSAND PATIENTS A MONTH IT ALSO STOCKS SUPPLIES IN CASE OF EMERGENCY 
CONSULTANT HAEMATOLOGIST HERE FOR THE PAST NINETEEN YEARS IS DOCTOR PAUL KELSEY 
I'M A BLOOD SPECIALIST THAT'S MY JOB SO I TREAT PEOPLE 
WITH BLOOD DISEASES I RUN A BLOOD BANK I RUN A BLOOD LABORATORY 
SO YEAH I'M A BLOODY DOCTOR 
A REGULAR VISITOR TO THE DEPARTMENT IS ALICE SELBY 
WHO SUFFERS FROM A LIFE THREATENING BLOOD DISORDER 
DID YOU HAVE ANY BLOOD OFF LAST TIME 
NO YOU LET ME OFF YOU GOT LET OFF LIGHTLY 
BUT YOU'LL NEED SOME TAKING OFF THIS TIME 
BECAUSE YOUR BLOOD IS A LITTLE ON THE THICK SIDE 
ALICE HAS POLYCYTHEMIA A CONDITION AFFECTING ONLY ONE IN FORTY THOUSAND 
HER BODY'S BONE MARROW IS PRODUCING DANGEROUSLY HIGH LEVELS OF BLOOD 
IF LEFT UNTREATED THE CONDITION IS POTENTIALLY FATAL 
SO EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS DOCTOR KELSEY HAS TO DRAIN SOME OF ALICE'S BLOOD 
JUST GENTLY SQUEEZE AND RELEASE AND WE'LL BE COLLECTING ABOUT HALF A LITRE OF BLOOD 
NORMALLY OUR BONE MARROW PRODUCES THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF BLOOD TO BALANCE 
WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT'S DESTROYED BUT WHEN THESE GET OUT OF SYNCH 
THE POTENTIAL IS FOR THE BLOOD TO ACCUMULATE AND BECOME VERY THICK 
WHEN IT'S VERY THICK IT DOESN'T CIRCULATE PROPERLY 
BUT BY DOING THIS SIMPLE PROCEDURE WE CAN KEEP IT TO THE NORMAL LEVEL 
I WOULDN'T BE HERE IF IT WASN'T FOR THEM 
THEY'VE GIVE ME AN EXTRA 
ELEVEN YEARS EVERY DAY'S A BONUS 
BLACKPOOL VICTORIA HOSPITAL'S RESIDENT EAR NOSE AND THROAT CONSULTANT AJAY NIGAM 
IS PREPARING FOR ANOTHER LONG AND VARIED LIST OF PATIENTS 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING THESE CASES THEY'RE ALL INTERESTING 
AND WE ARE PREPARED FOR THEM WE HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT THEM 
SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING THEM 
FIRST INTO THEATRE IS TWO YEAR OLD HARVEY BROWN 
HE HAS A PAINFUL CONDITION KNOWN AS GLUE EAR WHICH AFFECTS ONE IN FOUR CHILDREN 
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO TO YOUR EARS OFF 
OFF NO THEY'RE GONNA MAKE THEM BETTER 
THE SOLUTION TO HARVEY'S PROBLEM LIES IN THE USE OF TINY VENTILATION TUBES KNOWN AS GROMMETS 
HI MY NAME IS MR. NIGAM ARE YOU WELL YEAH THANK YOU ARE WE READY 
SO THE PLAN TODAY IS TO PUT SOME GROMMETS IN HIS EARS HOPEFULLY TO STOP HIM GETTING THESE INFECTIONS 
HAS HE HAD AN INFECTION RECENTLY 
ABOUT TEN DAYS AGO HE'S JUST FINISHED ANTIBIOTICS 
EARS NOT BEEN RUNNING AT ALL 
NO JUST LAST WEEK OH GOOD EXCELLENT THAT'S GOOD 
POP IT OVER ARE YOU GONNA BLOW ALL THAT NASTY SMELL AWAY 
BEFORE THE OPERATION CONSULTANT ANAESTHETIST JASON CUPITT HAS TO GIVE HARVEY A GENERAL ANAESTHETIC 
TRAUMATIC FOR BOTH MOTHER AND CHILD 
YOU'VE GOT TO BLOW THIS BALLOON UP I'LL HOLD HIM FOR YOU COME ON THEN NO NO 
HE'S AT THAT TYPICAL AGE GROUP WHERE THERE'S NO USE PRODDING AND POKING AND TRYING 
TO FIND A VEIN WITH THE NEEDLE SO WE JUST WENT FOR THE SMELLY GAS 
HARVEY LISTEN LISTEN DON'T GET SAD 
DON'T GET SAD 
AS EXPECTED THEY JUST TEND TO BE QUITE EXCITABLE 
AND FIGHT AND STRUGGLE BUT YOU ALWAYS WIN IN THE END 
DURING THE OPERATION THE GROMMETS ARE INSERTED INTO HARVEY'S EARDRUMS IN ORDER TO DRAIN AWAY THE FLUID 
AND NOW WE CAN SEE THE DRUM 
IN A CHILD THE EAR CANAL IS VERY NARROW SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO CAUSE ANY INJURY 
AND START ANY BLEEDING BECAUSE IF THERE IS ANY BLOOD THERE THEN YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT YOU ARE DOING 
SO THE CHILD OBVIOUSLY HAS SOME FLUID BEHIND THE EAR DRUM 
THE GROMMET SITS IN THE EAR DRUM YOU CAN SEE THE HOLE THERE THROUGH WHICH AIR GOES INTO THE MIDDLE EAR 
THAT'S THE EAR DRUM THERE 
AND THAT'S THE GROMMET AND YOU CAN SEE THE HOLE THERE 
THOUGH IT'S A SIMPLE PROCEDURE IT'S AN ANXIOUS TIME FOR HARVEY'S MOTHER GILL 
WHEN HE WAS GOING TO SLEEP IT WAS LIKE GOD WHEN HE WENT DEAD FLOPPY IT WAS HORRIBLE 
MY LONGEST FORTY FIVE MINUTES EVER 
I JUST WANT TO GO IN TO HIM NOW AND MAKE SURE HE'S ALL RIGHT IT WAS HORRIBLE 
SOON HARVEY IS AWAKE AND REUNITED WITH HIS PARENTS 
AFTER A SUCCESSFUL OPERATION IT'S HOPED THAT HARVEY'S EAR INFECTIONS WILL BECOME A THING OF THE PAST 
IT'S TIME FOR MR. NIGAM'S OUTPATIENT CLINIC 
IT'S A QUICK FIRE SERVICE SEEING PATIENTS WHO MAY REQUIRE ANYTHING 
FROM NON INVASIVE PROCEDURES TO MAJOR SURGERY 
MARY SAUNDERS PLEASE YES 
MARY SAUNDERS SUFFERS FROM BOUTS OF DIZZINESS A CONDITION MANY LIVE WITH IN SILENCE 
WHEN DO YOU GET THIS DIZZINESS 
IT'S ONLY WHEN I'M LYING DOWN IT SEEMS TO BE WHEN I'M ON MY LEFT SIDE 
I JUST FEEL THAT MY BODY'S FLOATING 
DOES IT HAPPEN ON LOOKING UP AT ALL SOMETIMES 
IN THE SUPERMARKET YOU LOOK UP 
I LOOK UP AT THE SHELF I FEEL 
YOU FEEL UNEASY WHEN THAT HAPPENS I FEEL FUNNY 
THE CONDITION YOU HAVE IS CALLED BENIGN PAROXYSMAL POSITIONAL VERTIGO 
AND IT'S CAUSED BY A PIECE OF CHALK IN YOUR INNER EAR 
THE INNER EAR HAS TWO PORTIONS THAT'S FOR HEARING THAT'S FOR BALANCE 
THERE ARE THREE CANALS OVER HERE 
SO IF I PUT MY HEAD LIKE THIS OR PUT MY HEAD THERE 
IT'S THESE CANALS TELLING MY BRAIN WHERE MY HEAD IS AT ANY TIME 
THE CURE IS VERY SIMPLE 
IN THIS CONDITION YOU HAVE A PIECE OF CHALK FLOATING IN THIS CANAL 
BY TURNING IT LIKE THIS TWISTING IT LIKE THIS 
IMAGINE THERE'S A MARBLE INSIDE IT TURNING IT IN A CERTAIN WAY 
I GUIDE IT AND DROP IT IN THERE 
WHERE IT CAN'T DO ANY MISCHIEF 
I SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY PATIENTS A YEAR AND PROBABLY SEE ONE HUNDRED WITH THIS CONDITION 
SO WE ARE STILL MISSING SOME OUT THERE IN THE COMMUNITY 
BUT BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT THEY DON'T COME TO SEE US 
O. K. SO WE'LL START BY THE FIRST POSITION AGAIN 
KEEP LOOKING AT MY NOSE 
THE EPLEY MANOEUVRE REQUIRES MARY'S HEAD TO BE MANIPULATED 
THROUGH SIX DIFFERENT POSITIONS 
GUIDING THE TINY PIECE OF CHALK 
OUT OF HARM'S WAY FROM ONE SIDE OF HER INNER EAR TO THE OTHER 
THIRTY SECONDS 
O. K. TURN YOUR HEAD TO FACE THE FLOOR YOU'RE DOING EXTREMELY WELL 
O. K. SO IF YOU JUST SIT UP FOR ME 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT BECAUSE PATIENTS COME BACK THE NEXT WEEK THE VAST MAJORITY ARE CURED 
BRING IT INTO YOUR CHEST THAT'S THE LAST POSITION 
THEY CAN'T BELIEVE THAT A SIMPLE THREE MINUTE PROCEDURE CAN CURE DIZZINESS 
IF THE TREATMENT HAS WORKED FOR MARY SHE SHOULD BEGIN TO FEEL THE BENEFIT WITHIN A WEEK 
JENNY KIDD HAS BEEN BROUGHT INTO A AND AMP E. TO HAVE HER KNEE INJURY ASSESSED 
SHE'S ANXIOUS TO DISCOVER WHETHER HER DANCING HOLIDAY HAS COME TO A PREMATURE END 
CAN YOU WIGGLE YOUR TOES FOR ME 
EXCELLENT FINE 
ANY PAIN THERE 
NO YOU'LL KNOW ABOUT IT IF THERE IS 
CAN YOU TRY TO LIFT YOUR LEG 
LIFT IT YEAH AH NOW THEN HANG ABOUT 
MM TRY IF I CAN I WILL 
THAT'S FINE THAT'S FINE 
NOW I'M GOING TO SEND YOU FOR X. RAY 
YOU'RE NOT TAKING IT OFF THEN 
NO I'LL THINK ABOUT IT LATER 
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ENJOYING OUR DANCING I'M MISSING HAPPY HOUR 
ELDERLY PATIENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER FRACTURES AFTER FALLING AS THEIR BONES ARE MORE BRITTLE 
X. RAYS ARE THEREFORE TAKEN AS A MATTER OF COURSE 
BUT MR. ALIDARI HAS GOOD NEWS FOR THE DANCING PENSIONER FROM LEEDS 
I'VE SEEN THE X. RAY I'M HAPPY 
ARE YOU HAPPY NOTHING'S BROKEN 
OH A LITTLE BIT OF BRUISES BLEEDING UNDERNEATH THE SKIN THERE YEAH 
ANY QUESTIONS YEAH WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT 
YOU'VE GOT YOUR HUSBAND 
ENT PATIENT MARK NUTTALL AND HIS PARTNER ALISON MANSFIELD 
HAVE A PROBLEM 
IT'S A PROBLEM SHARED BY FIFTEEN MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U. K. 
AND IT'S DRIVEN ALISON TO DESPAIR 
IT'S REALLY LOUD SOMETIMES LIKE A B. L. LLD O. ZE R. 
SOME PEOPLE THINK IT'S A LAUGHING MATTER OH SOMEBODY SNORES JUST GET OVER IT BUT 
WHEN IT'S QUITE AS BAD AS MARK'S SNORING YOU CAN'T GET OVER IT 
THIS IS WHERE MARK SLEPT 
MOST OF THE NIGHT 
AND AS YOU CAN HEAR 
HE'S STILL SNORING 
THEY'VE TRIED AIR STRIPS NASAL SPRAYS EVEN EARPLUGS ALL HAVE FAILED 
MORE DRASTIC ACTION IS REQUIRED 
MARK IS HAVING HIS TONSILS REMOVED 
ANOTHER CASE TO ADD TO MR. NIGAM'S VARIED AND BUSY SCHEDULE 
THIS IS PROBABLY THE LAST ROUTE TO BE ABLE TO RELIEVE THE PROBLEM 
OBVIOUSLY IF THIS ISN'T SUCCESSFUL IT'S DOWN TO SEPARATE BEDROOMS WHICH ISN'T IDEAL 
THAT'S THE INSIDE OF YOUR NOSE 
APART FROM SURGERY MUCH OF IT CAN BE RECTIFIED YOURSELF 
THERE ARE THREE MAIN RISK FACTORS SMOKING IF YOU SMOKE YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO SNORE 
ALCOHOL SOMETHING LIKE NINETY PER CENT OF MEN AND SIXTY PER CENT OF WOMEN SNORE AFTER EXCESS ALCOHOL 
AND THEN WEIGHT IF YOU'RE OBESE YOU TEND TO SNORE MUCH MORE 
TRY AND SNORE FOR ME NOW 
AND AGAIN 
SURGERY MAY SEEM EXTREME 
BUT IN MARK'S CASE IT'S HIS FINAL HOPE OF CURING HIS SNORING PROBLEM 
HAEMATOLOGIST PAUL KELSEY HAS A PASSION FOR CYCLING 
A HOBBY HE'S USED TO RAISE MONEY FOR BLACKPOOL VICTORIA HOSPITAL 
WE WENT FROM THE HEADWATERS OF THE AMAZON OVER THE ANDES 
AND DOWN TO THE PACIFIC COAST AND THEN WE DID FIVE HUNDRED MILES ACROSS BRAZIL 
WE RAISED NEARLY FORTY THOUSAND IN THE TWO EVENTS AND WE PLAN TO DO ANOTHER 
THIS IS ME JUST GETTING BACK INTO TRAINING AGAIN STARTING TO GET GOING AGAIN 
AND LYCRA OF COURSE REVEALS EVERY BULGE SO I HAVE TO HOLD MY BREATH 
LIKE SUPERMAN IN A TELEPHONE BOX I EMERGE LOOKING LIKE A CONSULTANT IN MY SUIT 
SO I HAVE A SPARE SET OF CLOTHES AT WORK 
THE MONEY RAISED HAS GONE TOWARDS VITAL PATIENT CARE WITHIN HIS UNIT 
WHICH THIS YEAR BECAME A REGIONAL CENTRE FOR THE INTENSIVE TREATMENT OF LEUKAEMIA 
COME IN 
JOE LONGTHORNE IS DOCTOR KELSEY'S MOST FAMOUS PATIENT 
SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THE BLACKPOOL BASED CABARET SINGER 
HAS BEEN FIGHTING NON HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA AND THEN LEUKAEMIA 
WITHOUT THE HELP OF DOCTOR KELSEY'S TEAM HE WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY 
OPEN YOUR MOUTH FOR ME 
THE FIRST TIME I WAS HERE AND DOCTOR KELSEY FIRST SAW ME 
IF I HAD LIVED HALF AN HOUR AWAY IT WOULD HAVE PROBABLY BEEN CURTAINS FOR ME FOR THE FINAL TIME 
THAT FINAL CURTAIN WOULD'VE FELL 
JOE'S DOING FANTASTICALLY WELL WITH NO LONG TERM SIDE EFFECTS FROM HIS BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT 
NOTHING UNTOWARD EXCELLENT UP YOU COME 
HIS ORIGINAL DISEASE SHOWS NO SIGNS OF RECURRING 
HIS BLOODS ARE NORMAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION IS FINE 
AND HE APPEARS TO BE AS HE PUT IT IN THE BEST OF HEALTH 
MORNING MORNING MORNING TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU 
THE TIME JOE NOW SPENDS VISITING OTHER PATIENTS IN THE UNIT 
IS JUST ONE WAY OF EXPRESSING HIS GRATITUDE TO DOCTOR KELSEY AND HIS TEAM 
YOU'RE LOOKING WELL JOE 
THANK YOU I FEEL WELL THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED YOU DOING ALL RIGHT 
YES SMASHING THAT'S IT HEY IT'S GONE UP ME BLOOD COUNT 
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT INNIT YEAH 
THEN JOE HEADS OFF TO PREPARE FOR ANOTHER PERFORMANCE IN HIS ADOPTED HOME TOWN KEEP GOING BYE BYE 
IT'S THE MOMENT OF TRUTH FOR SNORER MARK NUTTALL 
HIS HOPE OF AVOIDING A FUTURE OF SEPARATE BEDROOMS RESTS IN THE HANDS OF ENT SURGEON AJAY NIGAM 
THIS IS THE UVULA THAT WE SEE DANGLING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOUTH 
SO THE PLAN IS TO REMOVE BOTH THE TONSILS 
AND THIS SECTION HERE THAT WILL CREATE A MUCH WIDER OPENING 
A CUTTING DEVICE KNOWN AS A COBLATION WAND IS THE LATEST ALTERNATIVE TO LASER SURGERY 
SO THAT'S ONE TONSIL OUT 
OPERATING AT A RELATIVELY LOW SIXTY DEGREES CELSIUS 
THE WAND REMOVES MARK'S TONSILS 
WHILST KEEPING HIS POSTOPERATIVE PAIN TO A MINIMUM 
THEN THE NEXT STEP IS TO REMOVE THE UVULA 
THAT'S WHAT THE UVULA LOOKS LIKE 
THOUGH TONSILLECTOMIES ARE COMMON THE PROCEDURE IS NOT WITHOUT RISK 
THERE IS NO ROOM FOR ERROR AT ALL IN THIS 
IF THE PATIENT BLEEDS THEN YOU HAVE TO SET UP THEATRE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 
ANAESTHETISTS NURSING STAFF THEATRE 
AND THAT CAN TAKE TIME EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY SETUP HERE 
THIS IS A COMMON OPERATION NOT LIFE THREATENING WHY TAKE ANY CHANCES WITH IT 
I WOULD SAY ABOUT A SEVENTY TO EIGHTY PER CENT CHANCE THAT HE WILL STOP SNORING 
SO HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO HOME TONIGHT AFTER HE'S HAD SOMETHING TO EAT AND DRINK 
THIS WILL BE SORE SO I'VE PUT HIM ON PAINKILLERS TO TAKE HOME 
BUT HOPEFULLY THE PAIN WONT BE TOO BAD 
ONLY TIME WILL TELL WHETHER MARK'S OPERATION HAS CURED HIS SNORING FOR GOOD 
PARAMEDICS ARE THE FRONT LINE OF THE N. H. S. 
AMBULANCES ARE INCREASINGLY USED AS MOBILE HOSPITALS 
BRINGING HIGH STANDARDS OF PATIENT CARE TO THE POINT OF NEED SUCH AS ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS OR RTAS 
WE'RE JUST EN ROUTE TO A TWO VEHICLE RTA 
THE ONLY REPORT WE'VE GOT IS THAT THERE'S A VEHICLE IN A HEDGE 
ARE YOU INJURED ANYWHERE MY LOVE MY HEAD HURTS AND MY KNEE HURTS 
LET'S GET YOU IN THE AMBULANCE DON'T WORRY 
IT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE GOING ANYWHERE 
WE'LL HAVE A QUICK LOOK AT YOU I'LL JUST DO YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE ALL RIGHT 
THOUGH BETTY PUTNAM HAS A HISTORY OF HEART TROUBLE 
THE PARAMEDICS ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE INJURY TO HER NECK 
SO THE PAIN IS IF I'M RIGHT DOWN THE SIDE HERE 
DOWN THERE RIGHT 
IT'S WHIPLASH REALLY NOW WE'LL HAPPILY TAKE YOU TO HOSPITAL CHICK 
GET IT CHECKED OUT OH NO YOU DON'T WISH TO GO 
WITH PARAMEDICS ABLE TO ASSESS AND TREAT PATIENTS NOT ALL CASES NEED BE REFERRED TO HOSPITAL 
THEREBY FREEING UP VALUABLE RESOURCES 
BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S UP TO THE PATIENT 
AND BETTY HAS DECIDED SHE WANTS TO GO HOME 
WHAT YOU WILL FIND PROBABLY WITHIN THE NEXT HOUR OR TWO IS THAT YOU'LL STIFFEN UP A LOT 
YES YOU WILL STIFFEN UP O. K. SO YOU DON'T WISH TO GO TO HOSPITAL DO YOU 
NO O. K. OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS LITIGATION AND THINGS 
WE'VE HAD TO GET MORE PROFESSIONAL AND DO ALL OBS AND THINGS 
TO MAKE SURE ALL BASES AS THE CLICHE GOES ARE COVERED REALLY 
MICK AND CLARE'S NEXT CASE SEES THEM ATTEND TO SEVENTY THREE YEAR OLD OLIVE KELLY 
SHE'S FALLEN WHILST AT HOME AND THE FEAR IS SHE MAY HAVE INJURED HER HIP 
DO ME A FAVOUR CAN YOU RAISE THIS LEG UP THAT ONE 
YEAH O. K. PUT THAT ONE DOWN 
OLIVE YES WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH YOU CHICK 
SHALL WE TAKE YOU UP TO HOSPITAL AND GET YOU CHECKED OUT NO 
YOU MIGHT ONLY BE UP THERE FOR THE DAY 
THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS DECLINING TO GO TO HOSPITAL HAS BECOME A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE 
A SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION FOR BLACKPOOL'S PARAMEDICS 
I WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF JOBS 
PATIENTS REFUSE TO GO TO HOSPITAL 
I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED OLIVE TO HAVE GONE TO HOSPITAL 
HAVE YOU HAD A FLU JAB THIS YEAR OR NOT 
I SHOULD HAVE GOT THEM THIS WEEK 
BUT YOU'VE NOT HAD IT YET COME WITH US TO HOSPITAL AND YOU CAN HAVE IT THERE 
NO I'M NOT GOING 
TWO FOR ONE DO YOU A DEAL NO NO 
MY WORRY IS IF FIVE MINUTES AFTER WE LEAVE AND THE CARER LEAVES 
IF SHE FALLS AGAIN AND SHE DOES SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S MY WORRY 
MARY SAUNDERS HAS RETURNED TO THE EAR NOSE AND THROAT DEPARTMENT 
TO REPORT ON THE SUCCESS OF MR. NIGAM'S CURE FOR HER DIZZINESS 
WHAT'S THE DIZZINESS LIKE I'VE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY 
NO MORE SPINNING THAT FEELING IS GONE THE FEELING YOU DESCRIBED 
IF YOUR DIZZINESS COMES BACK YOU NEED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH ME 
AND WE CAN REPEAT THE MANOEUVRE NOW THAT YOU KNOW HOW SIMPLE IT IS 
TO GET RID OF THE CHALK IN YOUR EAR 
ANOTHER SUCCESS STORY BUT MR. NIGAM'S BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS STILL TO COME 
IT'S THE DAY OF BRIAN'S CRITICAL THROAT CANCER OPERATION 
OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT TWELVE HOURS HE WILL UNDERGO LIFE SAVING SURGERY 
EVERYONE'S TOLD ME WHAT TO EXPECT HOPEFULLY I'LL COME THROUGH THIS 
TODAY WILL ALSO SEE JOAN LILLEY GO UNDER THE SURGEON'S KNIFE 
FOR THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS SHE'S BEEN ANAEMIC AND SHORT OF BREATH 
MR. NIGAM PLANS TO PERFORM A BIOPSY ON A GLAND IN HER NECK 
TO DETERMINE WHETHER SHE HAS CANCER OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM 
I'M QUITE PLEASED THAT IT IS BEING DONE 
AS I DO WANT A RESULT 
I WANT TO FACE UP TO WHATEVER IT IS 
SO TODAY MR. NIGAM WILL BE RUNNING TWO OPERATING THEATRES AT THE SAME TIME 
FIRST UP IS BRIAN AN EX SMOKER LIKE MR. NIGAM HIMSELF 
THE CRUNCH CAME WHEN MY WIFE WAS PREGNANT TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO 
AND SHE WOULDN'T ALLOW ME TO SMOKE BECAUSE OF PASSIVE SMOKING SO I HAD TO GIVE UP AS WELL 
THIS GENTLEMAN WAS A SMOKER BUT UNFORTUNATELY EVEN WHEN YOU STOP SMOKING 
THE RISK OF GETTING A CANCER CONTINUES IT DOESN'T STOP IMMEDIATELY 
IT TAKES TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER YOU'VE GIVEN UP SMOKING 
TO BE AT THE SAME RISK OF CANCER AS A NON SMOKER 
TODAY'S OPERATION IS SO COMPLEX THAT TWO SURGEONS WILL HAVE TO WORK SIMULTANEOUSLY 
ALTOGETHER MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE STAFF WILL BE INVOLVED 
IN THE PROCEDURE TO REMOVE BRIAN'S LARYNX AND FOOD PASSAGE 
I HAD INITIALLY THOUGHT THE TUMOUR FINISHED HERE BUT IT DOESN'T 
SO I HAD TO READJUST MY INCISION TO TAKE SOME MORE SKIN OFF 
BECAUSE THE TUMOUR IS FURTHER INTO THE SKIN THAN I EXPECTED 
THIS IS A TUMOUR 
A FEW HOURS INTO THE LARYNGECTOMY AND MR. NIGAM MAKES A DISTURBING DISCOVERY 
I'VE FOUND SOME SUSPICIOUS TISSUE ON THIS SIDE OF THE CAROTID ARTERY WHICH LOOKS LIKE TUMOUR 
SO I'M SENDING IT FOR FROZEN SECTION WHICH MEANS THAT THE PATHOLOGIST CAN LOOK AT IT JUST NOW 
AND GIVE ME AN ANSWER BACK WITHIN THE NEXT TWENTY TO THIRTY MINUTES ON WHETHER THIS PIECE IS TUMOUR OR NOT 
IF FOUND TO BE CANCER THE NERVE SUPPLYING BRIAN'S TONGUE MAY NEED TO BE SEVERED 
BUT THE PATHOLOGY LAB SOON REPORTS BACK ON THE SUSPICIOUS SAMPLE 
IT'S NORMAL LYMPH NODES NO EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC SPREAD 
THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS PARALYSE THE TONGUE 
SO THE TISSUE I SENT OFF TO THE LAB DOESN'T SHOWN ANY TUMOUR 
WHICH MEANS I DON'T HAVE TO DISSECT ANY MORE AROUND IT THAT IS VERY VERY GOOD 
FIVE HOURS INTO THE OPERATION AND DESPITE A FEW SCARES 
EVERYTHING'S GONE TO PLAN 
THE TUMOUR'S ALL OUT IT'S JUST A MATTER OF PUTTING THE PLUMBING IN 
AS THE REST OF THE TEAM CONTINUE WITH THE PROCEDURE MR. NIGAM MOVES INTO HIS SECOND OPERATING THEATRE 
TO PERFORM JOAN LILLEY'S BIOPSY 
I HAVE SOME TIME NOW WHILST THE JEJUNUM IS BEING PUT INTO THE NECK 
I CAN GO ACROSS TO THE THEATRE DO THIS OPERATION AND BE BACK IN TIME TO DO THE NEXT BIT 
WHICH IS RAISE THE FLAP OF SKIN ON THE CHEST TO BRING IT TO THE NECK 
THE SAMPLE TAKEN WILL DETERMINE WHETHER JOAN HAS CANCER 
THAT'S THE NODE THAT WE'VE JUST TAKEN OUT 
THE BIOPSY WILL NOW BE SENT OFF FOR TESTING 
MEANWHILE THE OTHER OPERATION ENTERS ITS FINAL PHASE 
THE TEAM HAVE PUT BRIAN'S NEW FOOD PASSAGE IN PLACE 
ALL THAT'S LEFT IS FOR MR. NIGAM TO COMPLETE THE PROCEDURE 
THE EPIC TWELVE HOUR OPERATION IS OVER 
BRIAN WILL BE CLOSELY MONITORED IN INTENSIVE CARE WHERE THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL BE CRUCIAL 
IT'S GONE EXTREMELY WELL MUCH BETTER THAN I'D THOUGHT WE WOULD BE DOING 
MENTALLY NO PROBLEM I FEEL ELATED BECAUSE THE OPERATION WENT SO WELL 
ALL THE AREAS I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT DID NOT PROVE TO BE TRUE AND EVERYTHING WENT SO WELL 
PHYSICALLY YES I THINK I'LL SLEEP QUITE WELL TONIGHT 
MARK NUTTALL'S SNORING PROBLEM IS GREATLY IMPROVED 
MUCH TO THE DELIGHT OF HIS PARTNER ALISON MANSFIELD 
BEEN BRILLIANT BEEN SLEEPING ALL NIGHT 
BAR THE ODD ROLLING OVER 
BUT NOTHING HALF AS BAD AS IT WAS BEFORE 
UNFORTUNATELY JOAN LILLEY'S BIOPSY RESULTS SHOW SHE DOES HAVE CANCER OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM 
SHE'LL NOW RECEIVE TREATMENT IN THE HAEMATOLOGY UNIT 
BUT FOLLOWING HIS MAMMOTH THROAT CANCER OPERATION 
BRIAN IS WELL ON HIS WAY TO MAKING A GOOD RECOVERY 
WE'VE REACHED THE END OF ANOTHER DRAMATIC PERIOD IN THE LIFE OF BLACKPOOL VICTORIA HOSPITAL 
PATIENTS WERE TREATED AND LIVES WERE SAVED BUT THE MEDICS HERE KNOW THAT IN THE ERA OF PATIENT CHOICE 
THE N. H. S. OF THE FUTURE WILL FACE EVEN GREATER CHALLENGES 
PATIENTS HAVE TO BE CONFIDENT THEY ARE GETTING THE BEST CARE 
DELIVERED RAPIDLY IN THE LOCAL HOSPITAL 
OR ELSE THEY WILL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE 
THE NEW SYSTEM IS CREATING CHOICE AND WE HAVE TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT 
TO MAKE SURE THAT PATIENTS CHOOSE BLACKPOOL AND NOT OTHER HOSPITALS 
YOU'VE BEEN THE ONE TO BEAT 
THERE IS NO COMPETITION 
NO ONE'S GONNA MAKE A FOOL OUT OF ME 
DING DING ROUND TWO 
WHICH IS BETTER THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT 
THE BIGGEST NAMES IN BRITISH T. V. GO HEAD TO HEAD 
LEOPARDS KILL TIGER CUBS WITHOUT HESITATION
