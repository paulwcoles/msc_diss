IN ORDER TO GO DOWN AND STEAL THESE ITEMS FROM B. AND AMP Q. ON THEIR BEHALF 
IF YOU GO DOWN TO THE SHOPS THESE DAYS YOU COULD BE IN FOR A SURPRISE 
WE'RE SEARCHING HIM COS HE TOLD THEM HE HAD A KNIFE 
IF YOU GO DOWN TO THE SHOPS THESE DAYS YOU'D BETTER GO IN DISGUISE 
WHO'S GOT ANY I. D. ON THEM 
IF YOU GO DOWN TO THE SHOPS THESE DAYS YOU'D BETTER NOT GO ALONE 
TASER HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM PUT THEM OUT 
IT'S LOVELY DOWN AT THE SHOPS THESE DAYS 
BUT SAFER TO STAY AT HOME 
I'LL KILL YOU DEAD 
I'LL KILL YOU 
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE IT 
I'D HAVE SAID HIS BEHAVIOUR WASN'T EVEN HUMAN 
TWENTY MILES EAST OF HULL IN THE NORMALLY QUIET SEASIDE TOWN 
OF WITHERNSEA TROUBLE IS BREWING IN THE HIGH STREET 
C. C. T. V. CAMERAS ARE TRAINED ON THE CHEMIST SHOP WHERE A MAN INSIDE IS PICKING UP A PRESCRIPTION 
UNAWARE THAT COPS ARE WATCHING AND WAITING FOR HIM OUTSIDE 
HE'S WANTED BECAUSE THEY SUSPECT THAT WHEN HE LAST WENT SHOPPING 
HE HELD UP A SUPERMARKET ARMED WITH A HANDGUN 
WHAT'S HE WEARING PLEASE 
HE'S WEARING A BROWN BOBBLE HAT GREY JUMPER AND BLACK TROUSERS 
JUST CROSSING SEASIDE ROAD NOW 
WHAT'S HE GOT BROWN BOBBLE HAT YEAH 
C. C. T. V. WILL MONITOR HIM AND THERE WAS A LOCAL OFFICER TALKING TO US 
SO WE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE HE WAS GONNA BE 
BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM TIME IS RUNNING OUT 
ANOTHER FIFTEEN SECONDS AND HE'LL BE OUT OF C. C. T. V. COVERAGE 
WE WERE DOWN TO SECONDS BEFORE WE WERE GOING TO LOSE CONTACT 
WITH HIM VIA THE C. C. T. V. WHICH WE HAD 
P. C. BROOKE AND P. C. COLE AREN'T ORDINARY TRAFFIC COPS THEY'RE ARMED COPS 
BUT BEFORE THEY CAN PROCEED WITH FIREARMS 
THEY NEED OFFICIAL PERMISSION OR AUTHORITY FROM THEIR BOSS 
BECAUSE A GUN WAS USED IN THE ARMED ROBBERY OBVIOUSLY WE WERE DEPLOYED TO GO AND DEAL WITH HIM 
THEY'RE HOPING THEY CAN USE A NEW LESS THAN LETHAL WEAPON TODAY 
YOU ARE AUTHORISED BY THE CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT FOR A PRE EMPTIVE TASER OVER 
A TASER GUN WHICH FIRES A FIFTY THOUSAND VOLT CHARGE 
AT SUSPECTS RENDERING THEM DEFENCELESS INSTANTLY 
WE HAD AUTHORITY FOR A PRE EMPTIVE TASER 
IT MEANS THAT THE SUSPECT DOESN'T HAVE TO MAKE ANY THREATS TO ANYONE HE'S CONSIDERED SO DANGEROUS THAT 
THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH HIM IS TO USE A TASER AND THEN ARREST HIM WITH A MINIMUM OF FORCE AND FUSS 
NOW THERE'S ANOTHER COMPLICATION 
THE SUSPECT HAS MET UP WITH A FRIEND WHO COULD ACCIDENTALLY BE CAUGHT IN THE FIRING LINE 
STILL MONITORING THE C. C. T. V. STILL STATIONARY AT THE TELEPHONE BOX OPPOSITE EDWARDS STREET 
IT APPEARS THE MALE HE'S MET IS USING THE TELEPHONE 
THE COPS HAVE SEEN THEIR CHANCE THOUGH 
WHILE THE FRIEND IS MAKING A PHONE CALL THE SUSPECTED ARMED ROBBER IS IN FOR A SHOCKING SURPRISE 
TASER TASER TASER HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM 
PUT YOUR HANDS OUT PUT YOUR HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM 
IT FIRES OUT TWO BARBS WHICH ARE CONNECTED BY WIRES TO THE TASER DEVICE 
IT TENDS TO LOCK YOU UP AND YOU'LL JUST DROP TO THE FLOOR 
AT WHICH POINT FIFTY THOUSAND VOLTS IS GOING THROUGH HIM 
STAY THERE 
PUT YOUR HANDS ON THERE 
IF HE'S NOT COMPLIANT WE'VE GOT THE CAPABILITY 
TO JUST BE ABLE TO PULL THE TRIGGER AND HE GETS TASERED AGAIN 
UNTIL HE REALISES HE'S GOT TO COMPLY 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE TASER HAS EVER BEEN USED IN HUMBERSIDE AND IT'S WORKED 
THE SUSPECT'S COMING QUIETLY 
HE'S BEEN FINE HE'S BEEN FULLY COMPLIANT 
YOU'VE GOT TO BEAR IN MIND HE'S JUST HAD THE SHOCK OF HIS LIFE 
WALKED TO THE CHEMIST 
NO WEAPONS HAVE BEEN FOUND ON THE MAN AND HE'S PROTESTING 
HIS INNOCENCE AS IS HIS MATE STILL IN THE PHONE BOX 
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT AN ARMED ROBBERY 
WHAT'S HE SAID TO YOU THIS MORNING 
I JUST LITERALLY MET HIM JUST FIVE METRES DOWN THE ROAD 
AND I WALKED TO THE PHONE BOX TO RING MY MUM TO SEE IF SHE WAS IN 
AND THEN YOU LOT TURNED UP SO HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO ME 
SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE'S BEEN THIS MORNING OR ANYTHING ALL RIGHT MATE O. K. 
I CAN PROVE WHERE I'VE BEEN THIS MORNING WE'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT DON'T WORRY 
YEAH DON'T WORRY 
I'M NOT IN ANY WAY CONNECTED TO AN ARMED ROBBERY AM I 
NO NOT THAT WE'RE AWARE OF AT THIS STAGE GOOD 
YOU JUST HAPPENED TO BE IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME 
THE MAN IS AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER 
HE CAN NOW GET BACK TO HIS MOBILE PHONE CALL 
NO I'M BEING DEADLY SERIOUS 
COME OUT AND HAVE A LOOK THERE'S LOADS OF COPPERS EVERYWHERE 
THE SUSPECTED ARMED ROBBER IS UNHURT BUT HE'S NOT AT ALL HAPPY ABOUT BEING TASERED 
IT'S A COMPLETE BALLS UP I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T EVEN SUPPOSED TO FIRE THEM UNLESS I ATTEMPT 
TO DO SOMETHING I DIDN'T DO NOWT THEN 
IT WAS AUTHORISED 
I AIN'T DONE NOTHING NOT SINCE I GOT OUT OF JAIL TWO YEAR AGO I AIN'T DONE A THING 
WE CAN'T DISCUSS WHY YOU'VE BEEN ARRESTED YOU KNOW THE SCORE 
THE COPS ARE CARRYING CONVENTIONAL GUNS AS WELL 
WITHOUT THE TASER THE STAKES COULD HAVE BEEN A WHOLE LOT HIGHER 
THEY'RE THE BARBS THAT ARE ACTUALLY FIRED INTO THE SUSPECT OR THE SUSPECT'S CLOTHING 
OBVIOUSLY THE POINTY BIT WITH THE HOOKED END TO STOP IT COMING STRAIGHT BACK OUT 
THE WIRES ARE WHAT IS ATTACHED TO THE ACTUAL TASER 
FROM WHICH THE CURRENT IS DISCHARGED DOWN THE WIRES INTO THE BARBS 
ONE HIT HIM IN THE CHEST THERE AND THE SECOND ONE WAS SOMEWHERE ON THE LEFT FOREARM 
REMOVING THE TWO BARBED PROBES AND CHECKING THE SUSPECT OVER IS A JOB FOR THE AMBULANCE CREW 
IT SORT OF SMARTED A BIT WHEN THEY WERE REMOVED AS OBVIOUSLY IT'S A SMALL FLESH WOUND SO IT WILL HURT 
THE AMBULANCE CREW JUST TOOK ALL THE BARBS AND PULLED THEM OUT 
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'D SEEN IT BEING USED AGAINST A PERSON 
I DIDN'T SEE ANY AFTER EFFECTS AT ALL 
HE HAD TWO SMALL CUTS WHERE THE TASER BARBS HAD ACTUALLY LANDED BUT APART FROM THAT HE WAS FINE 
NOT ALL BOBBIES ARE BORN INTO THE JOB 
ELEVEN YEARS AGO BEN TOWNHILL MANAGED SUPERMARKETS IN HULL 
BEFORE SIGNING UP FOR THE POLICE AFTER GETTING FED UP WITH SOME OF HIS CUSTOMERS 
SOME OF THE SHOPS I WORKED AT 
WERE IN THE LESS AFFLUENT AREAS OF THE CITY 
WE HAD OUR FAIR SHARE OF SHOPLIFTERS 
ME BEING THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT I AM 
MADE A POINT OF CHALLENGING THEM 
I JUST KIND OF FOUND IT A NATURAL PROGRESSION REALLY 
A DIFFERENT KIND OF CUSTOMER ONE WHO IGNORES THE HIGHWAY CODE 
IS THE CHALLENGE FOR P. C. TOWNHILL THESE DAYS 
HE CAN HAVE A TICKET CAN'T HE HE CAN HAVE A TICKET 
THERE'S TROUBLE IN STORE 
THAT'S RIDICULOUS 
BLOCKING THE VIEW ISN'T HE YEAH HE IS JUST GET HIM TO SHIFT 
JUST PULL UP THERE FOR US MATE PLEASE 
TOWNHILL HAS A WAY OF DEALING WITH PEOPLE WHO BREAK THE RULES OF THE ROAD EVEN IF IT IS JUST STOPPING 
ON A ZIGZAG LINE GIVING THEM A TICKET 
I'LL DO A CHECK ON HIM 
PEOPLE THAT PARK ON ZIGZAGS THAT USE A TELEPHONE 
DON'T WEAR THEIR SEATBELTS IT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME 
I'LL DEAL WITH IT IN A POSITIVE MANNER 
NOW THEN I'VE STOPPED YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE PARKED WITHIN THE LIMITS OF A PELICAN CROSSING 
I KNOW HE WAS JUST COME OUT FROM THE SHOP HE WAS AWAY TO THE GUY 
MY BOSS HE WORK AT THE SHOP HE WAS GOING FOR CIGS IN THE SHOP 
SO IT'S ALL RIGHT TO PARK ON ZIGZAGS FOR THAT THEN IS IT 
NO NO IT'S NOT RIGHT IT'S NOT A VALID REASON AT ALL 
ZIGZAGS ARE THERE FOR A REASON AREN'T THEY THEY'RE NOT THERE 
FOR PEOPLE TO JUST PARK ON COS THEY NEED TO NIP IN FOR CONVENIENCE 
I'M REPORTING YOU FOR PARKING WITHIN THE LIMITS OF A ZEBRA CROSSING 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING BUT IT MAY HARM YOUR DEFENCE IF YOU FAIL TO MENTION WHEN QUESTIONED 
SOMETHING YOU LATER RELY ON IN COURT ANYTHING YOU DO SAY MAY BE GIVEN IN EVIDENCE HAVE YOU GOT YOUR LICENCE 
NO I'M JUST WORKING UM NOT REALLY NOW 
PARDON CAN PROVE WITH THE LICENCE BUT NOT WITH ME 
HAVE YOU GOT A DRIVING LICENCE YEAH 
BRITISH DRIVING LICENCE IS IT ER ITALIAN ITALIAN RIGHT O. K. WHOSE VAN IS IT 
IT'S MY BOSS IT'S YOUR BOSS'S ARE YOU INSURED TO DRIVE IT YEAH 
RIGHT BECAUSE YOU'VE TOLD ME YOU'VE GOT AN ITALIAN LICENCE OBVIOUSLY 
I CAN'T GIVE YOU A TICKET FOR THAT WHICH IS WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO 
THE OFFENCE ITSELF CARRIES THREE POINTS AND A SIXTY FINE 
SO WHAT I HAVE TO DO IS SUMMONS YOU TO COURT 
YOU HAVE TO GO TO HULL MAGISTRATES' COURT 
O. K. AT THE END OF THE DAY 
IS THERE ANY THERE ISN'T I'M AFRAID NO COS 
IT'S DANGEROUS O. K. NO BUT IT'S ONLY ONE SECOND 
NO YOU WEREN'T THERE ONE SECOND YOU WERE THERE AT LEAST A MINUTE OR SO BECAUSE I PASSED YOU 
AND TURNED ROUND TO COME BACK AND YOU WERE STILL THERE NO BUT THAT'S WHY 
NOT ONLY THAT BUT YOU WERE MESSING AROUND WITH YOUR MOBILE TELEPHONE 
YOU DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT WAS GOING ON AROUND YOU 
HAVE YOU GOT ANY IDENTIFICATION ON YOU AT ALL NO NOT AT ALL

RIGHT WE NEED TO VERIFY WHO YOU ARE THEN DON'T WE 
HIS BODY LANGUAGE WAS ALL WRONG 
JUST HAVE A SEAT IN THE BACK OF THE CAR FOR ME PLEASE SIR 
TOWNHILL IS GOING TO HAVE TO PAY A VISIT TO THE MAN'S HOUSE 
TO FIND THE DETAILS HE NEEDS TO VERIFY HIS IDENTITY 
THERE'S NO TRACE ON THE DRIVING LICENCE 
YEAH HE SAID HE'S GOT AN ITALIAN LICENCE 
RIGHT IT'S DEFINITELY ONLY INSURED TO PASQUALE CUOMO 
RIGHT WE'LL RUN HIM BACK TO HESSLE THEN AND VERIFY WHO HE IS 
HE GAVE ME AN ADDRESS IN HESSLE 
WHICH WAS A LITTLE BIT FURTHER UP THE ROAD 
BUT HE COULDN'T GIVE ME AN EXACT ADDRESS WHERE IS YOUR HOUSE 
I LIVE WITH MY BROTHER 
IN HESSLE NO NO DOWN HERE 
RIGHT

GIVEN THE CHANCE THEY'LL TRY AND PULL THE WOOL OVER YOUR EYES LIKE HE WAS CLEARLY TRYING TO DO 
IT'S YOUR LAST CHANCE COS WE'LL FIND OUT WHO YOU ARE IF YOU'RE LYING TO US 
I'M WORKING I DON'T DO NOTHING 
YOU CAN'T GIVE THEM AN INCH COS THEY'LL TAKE A MILE 
AND IF YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT YOU'RE NOT PASQUALE O. K. 
AND YOU'RE HIS BROTHER YOU'RE NOT INSURED TO DRIVE THAT VAN 
NO I'M PASQUALE 
YOU'RE PASQUALE RIGHT SO WHY ARE YOU LYING TO US THEN 
BECAUSE THERE'S NO ONE TO CALL I DON'T LIKE 
THE TRUTH IS OUT 
PACO IS PASQUALE BUT SOMETHING STILL DOESN'T QUITE ADD UP 
BY YOU TELLING ME THAT YOU'RE NOT PASQUALE I'VE REPORTED YOU FOR AN OFFENCE THAT YOU HAVEN'T EVEN 
COMMITTED COS YOU'RE THE MAN INSURED TO DRIVE THE VAN AREN'T YOU MM HMM I'M SORRY 
SO I'M REALLY SORRY I THINK YOU'VE BEEN A LITTLE 
I'VE NOT GOT ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FINE AS WELL RIGHT O. K. 
WATCH YOUR LEGS IF HE'D HAVE BEEN HONEST WITH US TO START WITH 
WE'D HAVE DEALT WITH HIM AND HE'D HAVE BEEN ON HIS WAY 
BUT HE JUST KEPT DIGGING HIMSELF DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THIS HOLE 
JUST A COUPLE OF MILES AWAY AT A RETAIL PARK ON THE WATERFRONT THERE'S MORE TROUBLE IN STORE 
AT A B. AND AMP Q. 
A GANG HAS BEEN RUMBLED TRYING TO PULL OFF A CLEVER PLOT 
TO STEAL SOME EXPENSIVE POWER TOOLS 
TWO OF THEM HAVE FLED IN THE DIRECTION OF A NEARBY MCDONALDS 
TRAFFIC COPS ALEX WEEKS AND LEE ROBINSON HAVE BEEN CALLED IN TO CATCH THEM 
AS WE WERE MAKING OUR WAY DOWN 
MORE AND MORE INFORMATION WAS FILTERING THROUGH 
THERE WERE TWO LADS AS WE ARRIVED IN PUFFA JACKETS 
THE RETAIL PARK HAS GOT REASONABLE SECURITY AND C. C. T. V. AS WELL 
AND THEY'VE MONITORED THE TWO LADS GOING ACROSS THE RETAIL PARK 
AWAY FROM THE B. AND AMP Q. TOWARDS THE MCDONALD'S RESTAURANT 
AS WE CAME IN THEY WERE WALKING ACROSS HERE 
THERE WAS SOMETHING WITH THE BASEBALL CAPS AND THEIR DEMEANOUR AND HOW THEY WERE EDGING ACROSS THE CAR PARK 
IT'S JUST A FEELING YOU GET THEY'VE GONE INSIDE 
P. C. ROBINSON'S ABOUT TO CUT SHORT THE MEN'S HAPPY MEAL 
WHAT HAVE WE DONE MATE 
HOW ABOUT THE TWO WE'RE LOOKING FOR THAT'S JUST COME OUT OF B. AND AMP Q. 
WHY 
YOU MISSING YOUR BLUE GOLF THAT'S SAT OVER THERE 
IT'S NOT OUR BLUE GOLF ISN'T IT NOT 
YOU'RE THE TWO THAT HAVE JUST BEEN POINTED OUT TO US 
I'M SURE THE STAFF'LL BE HAPPY TO IDENTIFY YOU TWO ALL RIGHT 
YOU WHAT WHAT FOR THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING 
I THINK THEY WERE TRYING TO PLAY THE SYSTEM WITH US A BIT 
AND PLEAD IGNORANCE TO WHAT HAD GONE ON 
JUST SIT IN THERE AT THE MOMENT 
YOU TWO HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED 
WHEN WE CONFIRM THINGS YOU'LL BE GETTING YOURSELVES ARRESTED 
THEY WERE PROBABLY QUITE ADEPT AT TRYING TO PULL THE WOOL 
OVER POLICE OFFICERS' EYES AND FEIGNING A BIT OF INNOCENCE 
WHO'S GOT ANY I. D. ON THEM 
WHAT'S YOUR NAME 
THE MEN AREN'T LOCAL 
THEY'VE TRAVELLED SIXTY MILES TO GRAB A BARGAIN IN HULL TODAY 
IF YOU'RE BOTH FROM BARNSLEY HOW DID YOU GET HERE 
COME FOR THE MISSION HOW HAVE YOU GOT DOWN HERE WITH ME MATE 
HOW DID YOU GET HERE THEN 
MATE IN T'CAR WHICH CAR THAT GOLF 
MM SO WHERE'S YOUR MATE 
I DON'T KNOW HE AIN'T COME OUT 
HE AIN'T COME OF WHERE OUT OF THE SHOP 
THEIR MATE HASN'T COME OUT OF B. AND AMP Q. BECAUSE HE'S BEING HELD BY SECURITY 
I SUGGEST IF YOU WANT TO COMMIT CRIME STICK TO SOUTH YORKSHIRE 
WE HAVEN'T COME TO COMMIT CRIME 
WHO IS IT THAT'S IN THE SHOP WE'VE BEEN INTO HALFORDS 
I RANG HIM I GOES WHERE ARE YOU 
HE GOES I'M SAT IN CAR 
THERE'S BEEN A PROBLEM I SAYS WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE'S BEEN A PROBLEM 
AND HE PUT T'PHONE DOWN I TRIED RINGING HIM BACK AND I COULDN'T GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM 
IT'S NOT YOUR TYPICAL TAKING SOMETHING FROM A DISPLAY 
TRYING TO CONCEAL IT AND WALKING OUT THE STORE 
THEIR PLAN MEANT REMOVING AN ELECTRIC LAWNMOWER VALUED AT SIXTY 
FROM ITS BOX AND REPLACING IT WITH POWER TOOLS WORTH NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED 
BUT BEFORE THE THIRD MEMBER OF THE GANG COULD PAY FOR THE SIXTY MOWER 
STORE DETECTIVES WHO HAD SEEN THE SCAM BEFORE 
STEPPED IN AND SPOILED THEIR PLAN 
RIGHT YOU'RE IN CUSTODY ON SUSPICION OF THEFT 
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING BUT IT MAY HARM YOUR DEFENCE IF YOU DO NOT MENTION 
WHEN QUESTIONED SOMETHING WHICH YOU LATER RELY ON IN COURT AND ANYTHING YOU DO SAY MAY BE GIVEN IN EVIDENCE 
YOUR ARREST IS NECESSARY FOR A PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE INVESTIGATION 
THE THIRD LAD FROM WHAT I GATHER I DIDN'T SEE HIM 
HE WAS QUITE NERVOUS IN THE STORE AND ONCE HE'D BEEN DETAINED 
HE'S BASICALLY SPILLED THE BEANS ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT'S GONE ON AND DROPPED HIS TWO MATES RIGHT IN IT 
OFF HESSLE ROAD THE VAN DRIVER IS ALSO RIGHT IN IT THE HOLE HE'S BEEN DIGGING FOR HIMSELF 
IF HE'S GOT AN ITALIAN LICENCE THEN HE'S 
HAVE YOU HAD POINTS BEFORE NO PARDON 
YOU MUST HAVE DONE COS YOU'VE GOT A BRITISH DRIVING LICENCE NUMBER 
WHICH MEANS THEY'VE CREATED A LICENCE NUMBER FOR YOU AT SOME POINT FOR SOME REASON 
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN DEALT WITH FOR ANY TRAFFIC OFFENCES BEFORE YEAH 
WHAT 
SPEEDING SPEEDING RIGHT HOW MANY HAVE YOU GOT FOR SPEEDING THREE 
DESPITE WHAT HE'D TOLD US ABOUT NOT BEING INVOLVED 
WITH THE POLICE BEFORE HE HAD IN FACT BEEN PROSECUTED FOR SPEEDING 
WHICH IS GOOD NEWS FOR TOWNHILL 
DOES THAT MEAN WE CAN GIVE HIM A TICKET THEN 
BUT NOT SO GOOD FOR PASQUALE 
CAN YOU JUST CLARIFY THAT WITH THEM COS I CAN'T SEE THE PROBLEM 
IF HE'S GOT A DRIVING LICENCE NUMBER THAT'S GOT POINTS ON IT 
WE CAN GIVE HIM MORE 
OH JEEZ 
A DRIVER NUMBER IT'S LIKE A GHOST LICENCE IF YOU LIKE 
IT'S COMPLICATED IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE INS AND OUTS 
IT'S EFFECTIVELY A DRIVING LICENCE THAT DOESN'T EXIST 
IT'S PURELY FOR POINTS 
INSTEAD OF GOING TO COURT I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THREE POINTS NOW AND A FINE OF SIXTY 
FOR THE OFFENCE THAT YOU'VE COMMITTED 
JUST BEAR IN MIND IF YOU'D BEEN HONEST ME FROM THE START YOU'D HAVE BEEN ON YOUR WAY NOW 
CAN I AVOID THE POINTS PLEASE 
NO NO BECAUSE THE FINE COMES WITH THE POINTS I'M AFRAID 
AND VICE VERSA 
NOWADAYS EVERYTHING IS LINKED TO THE POLICE NATIONAL COMPUTER 
THE INSURANCE DATABASE THE DRIVING LICENCE DATABASE IT'S ALL ON THERE FOR US TO FIND OUT 
AND FIND OUT THEY HAVE 
HE'S GOT SIX POINTS FOR LICENCE OFFENCES AND INSURANCE 
THAT'S HIS DRIVER NUMBER THEY'VE JUST CHANGED THE NAMES AROUND 
HIS NAME IS QUAMAR PASQUALA SPELT LIKE THAT 
TWENTY EAST GROVE 
BUT THEY'RE STILL NOT THERE YET 
HE WON'T HAVE A LICENCE TO SURRENDER WILL HE 
IT WAS CHALLENGING 
THIS IS NOT YOUR STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN ONE COS HE AS IT WENT ON HE WAS JUST MAKING UP MORE AND MORE THINGS 
THAT WE HAD TO NEGATE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER 
AT THE MAIN POLICE STATION IN HULL THE TWO SHOPLIFTERS CAUGHT IN MCDONALD'S ARE BEING BOOKED IN 
WHEN WE GOT THEM INTO THE CUSTODY SUITE THEY WEREN'T 
STRANGERS TO THE ENVIRONMENT 
CAN YOU TAKE EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT IN YOUR POCKETS OUT AND STICK IT ON THE COUNTER FOR ME 
THE THIRD MAN INVOLVED BROUGHT IN BY P. C. STEVENSON WAS JUST EARNING A LITTLE EXTRA CASH ON HIS DAY OFF 
THE CAR THAT HE WAS USING WAS HIS MUM'S CAR WHICH 
HE HAD PERMISSION TO DRIVE AND HE HAD RELEVANT DOCUMENTATION FOR 
HE'D COME FROM OUT OF TOWN WITH THESE TWO LADS 
WHO HAD AGREED TO PAY HIM A SET SUM OF MONEY 
IN ORDER TO GO DOWN AND STEAL THESE ITEMS FROM B. AND AMP Q. ON THEIR BEHALF 
HE WAS ACTUALLY QUITE A NICE POLITE YOUNG CHAP WHO HAD OBVIOUSLY GOT TAKEN IN BY 
A COUPLE OF ALLEGED FRIENDS 
HE WAS TOLD THE PLAN OF WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND IT WORKED 
TO PLAN UNTIL GUILT GOT THE BETTER OF HIM AND HE GAVE HIMSELF UP 
CRACKING GOOD JOB 
BACK BY HESSLE ROAD THERE ARE STILL MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS 
HAVE YOU GOT AN ITALIAN LICENCE 
YEAH WHERE IS IT 
IT'S AT HOME 
IS IT TO HAND 
CAN YOU FIND IT YEAH YEAH I CAN FIND IT 
RIGHT DO WHAT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE 
WHAT I HAVE TO DO I HAVE TO TAKE HIM BACK TO MY WIFE 
YOU KNOW IN THE ARMY IN ITALY OH THIS GETS BETTER 
HAVE YOU OR HAVEN'T YOU GOT AN ITALIAN LICENCE AT YOUR HOME ADDRESS 
I DON'T THINK NOW IF YOU GO WITH ME 
IS IT AT HOME NO RIGHT 
WE WERE JUST GOING TO SUMMONS HIM FOR THE ZEBRA CROSSING OFFENCE THEN IT TRANSPIRED THAT 
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE AN ITALIAN DRIVING LICENCE 
WHERE IS IT THEN 
WHAT'S THAT WHERE IS YOUR LICENCE 
GO BACK TO ITALY BECAUSE AFTER THEN CHANGED TO ENGLISH 
SO WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT YOU'VE GOT AN ITALIAN LICENCE AT HOME THEN 
WITH NO VERIFICATION THE MAN EVEN HAS A LICENCE IN ITALY TOWNHILL IS GOING IN FOR THE KILL 
I CAN'T PROVE CAN I O. K. SO WE'RE SEIZING YOUR VAN FROM YOU AS WELL 
HE GAVE ME NO ALTERNATIVE REALLY THAN TO REPORT HIM FOR DRIVING OTHER THAN 
IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS LICENCE WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY NO DRIVING LICENCE AND SEIZING HIS VAN 
WHAT I HAVE TO DO I HAVE TO GO ROB TOMORROW 
WELL THERE'S NO NEED TO BE LIKE THAT IS THERE 
I'VE GOT FAMILY TO FEED AT THE END OF THE DAY 
I HAVE TO GO ROB OR I HAVE TO GO KILL SOMEBODY IT'S A BIT OVER THE TOP ISN'T IT 
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY HE'S COMMITTED 
I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR PEANUTS IN THIS COUNTRY I'M WORKING 
I ACCEPT THAT BUT THAT'S COMPLETELY SEPARATE AS TO WHY I'VE STOPPED YOU 
WHILST I CAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SYMPATHY FOR HIS POSITION 
I'VE GOT NO SYMPATHY FOR THE FACT THAT HE'S IN THAT POSITION BECAUSE THAT'S OF HIS OWN VOLITION 
NOBODY ASKED HIM TO DO WHAT HE DID 
HE CHOSE TO UNLOAD HIS VAN ON THE STREET 
THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THE VAN JUST STARTED APPEARING 
WELL I'VE LOST MY JOB THAT IS MY JOB 
BECAUSE I'M NOT ON THE DOLE THE GOVERNMENT TO GIVE ME A PENNY 
I HAVE TO WORK TO KEEP MY FAMILY GOING 
I'LL HAVE TO GO DO THINGS I DON'T WANT TO DO BUT YOU HAVE TO TO SURVIVE 
THESE DAYS MANY SHOPS ARE FITTED WITH PANIC ALARM BUTTONS 
WHEN THEY'RE HIT THE THEORY IS THE COPS SPRING INTO ACTION 
LIKE THIS AFTERNOON 
FRESH FROM DEMONSTRATING THEIR CUSTOMER CARE AT B. AND AMP Q. P. C.'S WEEKS AND STEVENSON 
ARE RESPONDING TO AN ALARM SET OFF IN TESCO'S 
WE HAD AN UPDATE FROM THE STORE 
THAT THERE'S BEEN THREE MALES KICKING OFF IN THE STORE ONE OF THEM'S BEEN DETAINED 
QUITE OFTEN THE ALARMS ARE FALSE BUT NOT THIS ONE TODAY 
AS SOON AS WE WALKED IN IT WAS LIKE WORLD WAR THREE HAD BROKEN OUT 
THERE WAS BITS OF BARRIER STREWN AROUND 
THERE WERE MEMBERS OF STAFF TRYING TO KEEP OTHER PEOPLE OUT OF THE STORE 
WATCH YOUR LEGS 
CALM DOWN CALM DOWN FELLA LET GO OF ME NOW 
CALM DOWN 
LET GO OF ME THEN TELL HIM TO LET GO OF ME 
JUST LET GO OF HIM LET GO OF ME NOW 
THE TWO LADS ON THE FLOOR DIDN'T COME IN TO DO THEIR SHOPPING THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A FIGHT 
THEY'D BEEN OBSERVED BY A MEMBER 
OF THE PUBLIC URINATING UP A DOORWAY 
AND THE MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC FELT THAT THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE AND 
MADE A PASSING COMMENT TO THEM OF DO YOU THINK IT APPROPRIATE TO BE HAVING A PIDDLE UP A DOORWAY 
IT'S NOT REALLY ON IS IT AND THEN HE'D GONE INTO TESCO EXPRESS TO DO HIS SHOPPING 
THE TWO LADS HAVE FOLLOWED HIM IN AND ASSAULTED HIM IN THE AISLES 
WHAT'S YOUR NAME I'M NOT TELLING YOU YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME 
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST ON SUSPICION OF ASSAULT 
NO WE'RE NOT STANDING UP AT THE MOMENT STAND ME UP NOW 
YOU MUST BE MR. SMITH THEN 
GET ME UP NOW CALM DOWN 
THE LADS HAVE BEEN HANDCUFFED BUT THEY ARE STILL MORE THAN A HAND OR A LEG FULL 
IT WAS JUST A CASE OF MAKING BEST USE OF OURSELVES AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC UNTIL OTHER PATROLS ARRIVED 
JUST SLIDE SIDEWAYS SO HE CAN TALK TO HIM THAT MIGHT CALM HIM DOWN CALM HIM DOWN FOR US CALM DOWN 
WHEN WE ARRIVED I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE IT 
THERE WAS A CROWD GATHERING OUTSIDE 
YOU'VE GOT BIG GLASS WINDOWS AND PEOPLE CAN SEE RIGHT INTO THE SHOP 
IT WAS ABSOLUTE CHAOS 
STAY CALM I WILL I'LL KILL YOU 
I WILL I'LL KILL YOU YES I'LL KILL YOU 
I'LL KILL YOU I'LL KILL YOU 
I'LL REDUCE SOME PRESSURE OFF YOU JUST AS LONG AS YOU RELAX 
YOU GONNA KEEP CALM NOW YEAH 
THESE TWO KIDS WERE BROTHERS AND ALL THESE TWO BROTHERS DID WAS WIND EACH OTHER UP 
ARE YOU GOING TO STAY CALM TO START WITH I'M GONNA LET MARK SIT UP 
LUCKILY SOME GALLANT SHOPPERS HAD WADED IN TO RESTRAIN THE BROTHERS 
BEFORE THERE WAS A CHANCE OF ANYONE GETTING BADLY HURT 
I DID A SEARCH OF HIM TO MAKE SURE HE HAD NOTHING ELSE ON HIM 
AND HE DISCLOSED HE HAD A KNIFE BLADE IN HIS BACK POCKET 
I ACTUALLY FOUND A THREE INCH PEN KNIFE BLADE THAT HAS BEEN SNAPPED OFF 
WITH A BIT OF BLUE MASKING TAPE ON IT TO ACT AS A HANDLE 
YOU SHOULD'VE STABBED HIM 
THE POTENTIAL OF IT WAS QUITE SINISTER THERE'S NOT MANY REASONS PEOPLE NEED TO CARRY KNIFE BLADES 
YOU SHOULD'VE STABBED HIM MAN YEAH WHATEVER 
OFF YEAH WHAT OF IT OFF HEY 
COME ON THEN STAY THERE AND STAY CALM 
WE'VE GOT A VAN HERE FOR YOU 
KEEP YOURSELF NICE AND CALM KEEP AWAY FROM ME THEN 
HE'S NOT COMING WITH YOU 
BROTHERLY LOVE I THOUGHT YOU SAID HE WAS YOUR BROTHER AND YOU LOOKED OUT FOR HIM 
HE IS WELL CALM DOWN THEN 
WHEN WE WALKED OUT OF TESCO EXPRESS WITH THIS LAD TRUSSED UP AND TAKING HIM TO THE VAN 
ALL I CAN SEE IS THE WHOLE SHOP FRONT OF TESCO EXPRESS 
FULL OF CHINESE STUDENTS AND LOCAL HULL FOLK 
ALL WITH THEIR DIGITAL CAMERAS 
AND VIDEO PHONES ALL FILMING EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON 
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN THE ANTICS OF OUR SHIFT ON YOUTUBE 
AND I CAN'T IMAGINE IT'LL BE THE LAST 
BEND OVER 
ARGH MY ARM 
KEEP WALKING YOU 
WE ARE VERY MUCH AWARE THAT VIOLENCE VIOLENT SITUATIONS WEAPONS ETC ARE ON THE INCREASE 
TAXI UP THE STEPS DON'T MESS ABOUT 
IN YOU GET 
ANOTHER HAPPY CUSTOMER 
NOBODY WANTS TO BE CONFRONTED WITH VIOLENT SITUATIONS 
NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THEM BUT IT'S THE NATURE OF THE JOB 
THE TWO BROTHERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE POLICE STATION DOWNTOWN 
WHERE ONE OF THEM HAS SWAPPED RAGING ON THE FLOOR OF TESCO'S WITH RAGING ON THE FLOOR OF HIS CELL 
DON'T LIE TO ME STEPHEN 
STAY CALM 
STAY CALM STEPHEN STAY CALM 
THEY WEREN'T SO MUCH SPEAKING TO US AS SNARLING AND GRUNTING AT US A LOT OF IT WASN'T COHERENT 
YOU COULDN'T WORK OUT WHAT THEY WERE SAYING 
BUT IT WAS ALMOST BACK TO CAVEMAN MENTALITY OF 
WANTING TO FIGHT WITH THE WORLD 
PUT YOUR HEAD TO THE OTHER SIDE FOR ME STEPHEN NO 
YES TURN YOUR HEAD NO 
YES TURN YOUR HEAD 
LUCKILY THE COPS HAVE A PROCEDURE TO GET OUT OF THE CELL ALIVE 
WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A COUPLE OF THE OTHER 
OFFICERS THAT WERE PRESENT IN THE CUSTODY SUITE AT THE TIME THE CELL EXIT ROUTINE WAS PERFORMED ON HIM 
MOVE 
THE OTHER BROTHER IS CALM FOR NOW EXCEPT THE COPS HAVE GOT HIS DRIVING LICENCE 
LET GO OF THAT NOW CALM DOWN FELLA 
LET GO OF THAT NOW 
WHAT DID WE SAY ABOUT BEING DAFT ARGH AARGH 
YOU WERE WARNED WEREN'T YOU FELLA 
HE DIDN'T LIKE HAVING HIS DRIVING LICENCE TOUCHED AND WENT A BIT BALLISTIC AT THAT POINT 
WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO ASCERTAIN HIS FULL DETAILS 
AND CONFIRM THEM WITH HIS DRIVING LICENCE 
SO HE HAD TO BE RESTRAINED RE HANDCUFFED TAKEN TO THE CELL 
AND PLACED PROPERLY IN A CELL FOR HIS OWN SAFETY AND EVERYBODY ELSE'S 
BEHAVE YOURSELF 
CROSS YOUR LEGS OVER FOR ME 
DO YOU WANT TO DO A SEARCH ON HIM FOR US 
DO A FULL SEARCH 
IT'S SOMETHING YOU SEE AS A POLICE OFFICER BUT I WOULDN'T SUGGEST IT'S A DAILY OCCURRENCE 
WE DON'T SEE THAT SORT OF BEHAVIOUR EVERY DAY 
CERTAINLY NOT THE MOST VIOLENT PEOPLE I'VE DEALT WITH 
BUT I THINK THE POTENTIAL FOR THEM TO BECOME QUITE VIOLENT AND MORE NASTY WAS CERTAINLY QUITE HIGH 
THE THREAT OF POTENTIALLY VIOLENT SITUATIONS HAS LED TO COPS WITH GUNS 
NOW ROUTINELY PATROLLING THE STREETS 
A MALE HANGING AROUND 
P. C. STEVE COLE AND P. C. HELEN MANN ARE ARMED AND ON THE LOOKOUT FOR A SUSPECTED RAPIST 
FOREIGN MALE FIVE F. T. SIX OR FIVE F. T. SEVEN 
BUT THE DESCRIPTION IS ONLY A RATHER VAGUE ONE 
FOREIGN LOOKING MALE A FOREIGN LOOKING MALE THAT'S IT FIVE F. T. SIX OR FIVE F. T. SEVEN 
RECEIVED WE'LL GO AND HAVE A LOOK 
THERE'D BEEN A CALL RECEIVED THAT A FEMALE WAS MAKING AN ACCUSATION 
OF RAPE PRIOR TO BEING IN ONE OF THE LOCAL NIGHTCLUBS' 
WE WEREN'T TOO FAR FROM THE AREA 
SO WE DECIDED TO CARRY OUT AN AREA SEARCH FOR THIS MALE 
THERE'S BEEN A POSSIBLE SIGHTING OF THE MAN ROUND THE BACK OF SOME BUILDINGS 
SECURITY HAD REPORTED A SUSPICIOUS MALE WITHIN 
THAT AREA AND THAT'S WHY WE DROVE INTO THE YARD 
IS THAT SOMEBODY THERE WHERE

HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IF HE'D MATCHED THE DESCRIPTION OF THE GUY WE WERE LOOKING FOR 
WE OBVIOUSLY CHECKED HIM OUT TO MAKE SURE HE WASN'T WANTED 
AND ULTIMATELY HE DIDN'T MATCH THE DESCRIPTION AT ALL 
YOU'VE GOT ON A WHITE T. SHIRT 
YEAH WHITE T. SHIRT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A REASON FOR HIM 
BEING DOWN THERE SO WE NEEDED TO GET HIM TO EXPLAIN WHAT THAT REASON WAS 
I DON'T HAVE MY WALLET YOU HEARD WHAT MY MATE SAID YOU'VE JUST SHOWED HER THAT 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH YOUR WALLET 
COULDN'T REALLY REMEMBER ANYTHING HOW HE'D GOT DOWN THERE WHAT HE WAS DOING DOWN THERE 
BUT HE'D LOST HIS WALLET 
HOW I COULD FIND MYSELF WITHOUT MY WALLET'S EVEN WORSE 
RIGHT I NEED TO KNOW HOW YOU FOUND YOURSELF DOWN HERE 
YOU WERE FALLING ASLEEP ON THE SIDE THERE 
I FALL ASLEEP ANYWHERE ME 
HAVE YOU DROPPED IT ROUND THERE I DUNNO DO YOU MIND IF I HAVE A LOOK 
NO LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
YOU GET A FEEL FOR THESE THINGS AND IT WAS JUST VERY STRANGE THAT HE WAS' 
DOWN THERE AT THAT TIME OF NIGHT YOU KNOW IN THAT STATE IN AN AREA 
THAT WAS BOARDED OFF AND CLEARLY NOT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND I DON'T CARRY MY CREDIT CARD 
SO YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR WALLET ON YOU 
I HAVE YOU HAD IT WHEN YOU CAME OUT 
WITHOUT A DOUBT WHAT'S THAT IN YOUR POCKET PHONE YEAH 
THE COPS HAVE NO IDEA WHY THE MAN'S DOWN HERE BUT THEY DO HAVE THEIR SUSPICIONS 
IT'S NOT A MILLION MILES AWAY FROM THE RED LIGHT AREA 
IT MAY WELL HAVE BEEN THAT HE'D BEEN USING THE SERVICES OF ONE OF THE LADIES OF THE NIGHT SHOULD WE SAY 
AND SHE'D DECIDED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS DRUNKEN STATE AND HAD HIS WALLET OFF HIM

BUT THERE CERTAINLY WASN'T ANYBODY LYING INJURED 
OR ANYBODY ELSE IN THE HOUSE 
AT THE NICK THOUGH IT'S APPARENT JUST HOW SERIOUS THE INCIDENT WAS 
JUST NEED TO FIND CONTAINERS TO PUT THEM IN CHARGE ROOM 
THEN BOOK THEM INTO PROPERTY 
THE MALE THAT I'D ARRESTED 
WAS BEING BOOKED INTO CUSTODY BY OTHER OFFICERS 
HE APPEARED TO HAVE NO INJURIES SO IT MAY WELL HAVE BEEN 
THAT HE WAS JUST COVERED IN THE OTHER GUY'S BLOOD NOT HIS OWN 
SCARBOROUGH FAIR BY SIMON AND GARFUNKEL 
THE OTHER MAN WHO COLLAPSED WITH A KNIFE WOUND 
MADE A FIGHTING RECOVERY AFTER TREATMENT 
HE KICKED OFF AT THE HOSPITAL AND TRIED TO ATTACK THE POLICE PEOPLE 
THAT WERE THERE WITH HIM SO HE SUBSEQUENTLY GOT ARRESTED AS WELL 
AND AS A RESULT 
HE WAS SENT TO A YOUNG OFFENDERS' INSTITUTION FOR EIGHT WEEKS 
HIS BARE SHIRTED COMRADE WHO ATTACKED HIM WAS DEPORTED BACK TO RUSSIA 
THE TWO BROTHERS MASSACRING TESCO 
APPEARED IN CROWN COURT ON VALENTINE'S DAY 
AND WERE SENTENCED TO TEN AND TWELVE MONTHS IN A YOUTH DETENTION FACILITY FOR AFFRAY 
THE B. AND AMP Q. BOYS ALL PLEADED GUILTY IN COURT TO ATTEMPTED THEFT 
THE TWO CAUGHT IN MCDONALD'S WERE GIVEN TWELVE MONTH COMMUNITY ORDERS 
WHILE THE ONE WHO WAS EARNING A LITTLE EXTRA ON HIS DAY OFF WAS FINED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
AFTER QUESTIONING THE ALLEGED ARMED ROBBER GIVEN THE SHOCK TREATMENT 
WAS ELIMINATED FROM POLICE INQUIRIES 
FURTHER ARRESTS WERE MADE 
BUT NO ONE WAS PROSECUTED FOR THE SUPERMARKET ROBBERY 
AND IT TURNED OUT THE UNINVITED VISITOR 
WHOSE SHOES HAD TURNED INTO SPACE DEBRIS 
BELIEVED HE WAS A WASHING MACHINE

REMEMBER ME
