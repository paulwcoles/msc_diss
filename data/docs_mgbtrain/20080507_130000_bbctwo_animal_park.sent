HELLO AND WELCOME TO ANIMAL PARK 
I'M BEN FOGLE AND IN TODAY'S PROGRAMME I'M OUT IN KENYA 
WHERE I'LL BE RUNNING IN A MARATHON ACROSS A GAME RESERVE TO HELP RAISE MONEY FOR CONSERVATION 
BUT THIS IS NO LITTLE FUN RUN 
IT'S ONE OF THE TOUGHEST ENDURANCE RACES IN THE WORLD 
AND IF THE HEAT DOESN'T GET YOU THERE'S ELEPHANTS 
IF HE GOES TO THE CROWDS YOU HAVE A PROBLEM 
NOT TO MENTION A PRIDE OF HUNGRY LIONS STALKING THE START LINE 
AND WHILE BEN IS SCAMPERING ACROSS THE PLAINS OF KENYA I'M ENJOYING THE SUN HERE IN WILTSHIRE 
I'LL BE BRINGING YOU A BEHIND THE SCENES GLIMPSE OF THE HOUSE THE ESTATE AND OF COURSE 
THE ANIMALS IN THE SAFARI PARK INCLUDING 
THE GANGSTERS OF THE BIRD WORLD 
WE'LL DISCOVER WHAT MAKES THE VULTURE SUCH A SUCCESSFUL SCAVENGER 
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL BEAK 
THEY GO THROUGH EVERYTHING SKIN BONE FLESH THE LOT 
AND THEN I'LL BE HIPPO SPOTTING 
TO FIND OUT WHY THERE'S NOTHING LIKE MUD MUD GLORIOUS MUD 
OH THAT'S FANTASTIC 
BUT FIRST KEEPER RYAN HOCKLEY AND I ARE ABOUT 
TO EMBARK ON A CHALLENGE THAT WILL TEST OUR COURAGE TO THE VERY LIMITS 
RYAN HAS WORKED AT LONGLEAT SAFARI PARK FOR OVER EIGHTEEN YEARS 
SO HE'S SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH THE BIG ANIMALS 
HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT THEM DESPITE THE FACT HE'S NEVER ACTUALLY MET THESE CREATURES IN THE WILD 
EVERY DAY HE COMES UP TO THE EAST AFRICA RESERVE 
BUT HE'S NEVER BEEN TO AFRICA UNTIL NOW 
SEVEN THOUSAND KILOMETRES FROM WILTSHIRE RYAN AND I HAVE JUST ARRIVED IN THE REAL EAST AFRICA 
WE'RE ON A MISSION TO HELP SAVE THE WILDLIFE 
THIS IS THE LEWA CONSERVANCY 
A SIXTY ONE THOUSAND ACRE WILDLIFE RESERVE IN KENYA 
IT'S A SAFE HAVEN FOR ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS WHOSE SURVIVAL IS UNDER THREAT 
THERE ARE RHINO HERE GREAT HERDS OF ELEPHANTS AND PLENTY OF LIONS 
BUT KEEPING THIS NOAH'S ARK SAFE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS IS AN EXPENSIVE BUSINESS 
SO TO RAISE FUNDS EVERY YEAR THEY HOLD THE LEWA SAFARICOM MARATHON 
ON A CROSS COUNTRY ROUTE RIGHT THROUGH THE CONSERVANCY 
IT'S A TOUGH RACE 
ATTRACTING MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED FIFTY COMPETITORS FROM OVER TWENTY COUNTRIES 
WHO BETWEEN THEM USUALLY RAISE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS 
THERE ARE INTERNATIONAL CLASS RUNNERS HERE AND THERE'S RYAN AND ME 
IT'S THE DAY BEFORE THE RACE AND WE NEED TO REGISTER 
HELLO HIYA 
BEN FOGLE AND RYAN HOCKLEY PLEASE 
BEN FOGLE ONE HUNDRED NINETY TWO THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THANK YOU 
WE'VE BOTH SIGNED UP FOR THE HALF MARATHON THAT'S TWENTY ONE KILOMETRES OR THIRTEEN MILES 
RYAN WHOSE NICKNAME IS COS HAS SPENT THE LAST TWO MONTHS RAISING SPONSORSHIP MONEY 
MY MAIN REASON FOR DOING IT IS GOING TO BE TO HELP THE WILDLIFE 
IT'S A FUND RAISING THING 
ACTUALLY NOW I'VE ARRIVED OUT HERE AND SEEN WHERE HOPEFULLY THE MONEY WILL BE SPENT 
IT'S GIVEN ME A REAL LIFT 
IT'S GIVEN ME A REAL BUZZ FOR DOING IT 
BOTH OF US HAVE BEEN TRAINING FOR SEVERAL WEEKS 
BUT IN THIS RACE THERE'S MORE TO CONTEND WITH THAN JUST THE RUNNING 
DAVID PARKINSON THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE LEWA CONSERVANCY 
IS TAKING US ON A RECCE OF THE COURSE 
HE KNOWS THE DANGERS BECAUSE HE'S RUN IT THREE TIMES HIMSELF 
SO WHAT ARE GOING TO BE OUR MAIN PROBLEMS 
THE FIRST THING TO REMEMBER IS WE'RE ON THE EQUATOR 
AND ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT TOO HOT TODAY ON SATURDAY IT COULD BE A LOVELY DAY 
FOR EVERYBODY BAR YOU 
AND IT DOES GET VERY HOT 
TEMPERATURE WILL GET UP TO TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY DEGREES 
BUT THE HUMIDITY WILL REMAIN FAIRLY LOW 
THE NEXT POINT IS WE'RE AT FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET 
AND THAT REALLY TAKES IT OUT OF YOU 
YOUR PACING IS KEY 
YOU HAVE TWENTY ONE KILOMETRES KNOW YOUR DISTANCE 
IT'S GOOD TO THINK BEFORE YOU START ABOUT WHAT KIND OF TIME YOU'RE SETTING YOUR SIGHTS ON 
HAVE YOU GOT AN IDEA FOR YOUR TIME 
I'LL JUST BE THANKFUL IF I FINISH ON TWO LEGS AS OPPOSED TO ALL FOURS 
I HAVE TO ASK ABOUT THE WILDLIFE WE HAVE HERE ELEPHANTS RHINO LION EVERYTHING 
OF COURSE IT'S A MAJOR CONCERN OF OURS IT IS A RISK 
HAVING SAID THAT THE SECURITY PLAN THAT IS IN PLACE 
AND WE HAVE DONE THE EVENT SIX TIMES 
FIRST OF ALL WE'RE CHECKING THE ANIMALS WHICH ARE LIKELY TO CAUSE PROBLEMS 
THE RISKS ARE VERY REAL 
LAST YEAR A CHARGING RHINO SENT COMPETITORS DIVING FOR COVER 
AND TO A HUNGRY LION A MARATHON RUNNER JUST LOOKS LIKE FAST FOOD 
SO THE RANGER SERVICE WILL BE OUT IN FORCE TO PROTECT US FROM THE GROUND 
AND FROM THE AIR 
THEY'RE LED BY LEWA'S HEAD OF SECURITY RICHARD MOLLER 
HE RECKONS THAT ELEPHANTS ARE THE GREATEST THREAT 
THEY'RE DANGEROUS ANIMALS 
THEY'RE ANIMALS THAT HAVE AN INSTINCT THAT HUMANS ARE A DANGER TO THEM 
IF THEY SEE A LONE RUNNER OR A GROUP OF RUNNERS IT'S VERY POSSIBLE 
THAT AN ELEPHANT BULL PARTICULARLY AN ELEPHANT BULL IN MUSK 
WILL CHARGE THEM 
AGAIN A SERIOUS POTENTIAL DANGER TO 
TO THOSE PEOPLE RUNNING 
AND NOW THERE'S BEEN A REPORT OF LIONS IN THE AREA 
MAYBE THEY'VE BEEN ATTRACTED BY THE POSSIBILITY OF AN EASY KILL 
I HOPE NOT BECAUSE RYAN AND I REALLY NEED TO GO OUT THERE TO DO A TRAINING RUN 
AT LEAST IF ANYTHING UNTOWARD SHOULD OCCUR 
BEN AND RYAN CAN HAVE THE COMFORT OF KNOWING THAT IN AFRICA NOTHING GOES TO WASTE 
VULTURES ARE ESSENTIAL TO THIS FEARSOME RECYCLING 
AND RECENTLY A WHOLE FLOCK CAME TO LAND IN WILTSHIRE 
THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY FLY TO LONGLEAT BUT WERE SHIPPED FROM A ZOO IN HOLLAND 
WHILE THEY'RE BECOMING ACCLIMATISED THEY'RE BEING KEPT TEMPORARILY IN THE OLD FLAMINGO HOUSE 
I'VE COME TO FIND OUT MORE FROM THE KEEPER WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THEM MARK TYE 
HOW MANY BIRDS HAVE YOU GOT 
WE'VE GOT TEN ALTOGETHER 
HOPEFULLY FIVE MALES FIVE FEMALES 
YOU SAY HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T KNOW 
APPARENTLY THEY HAVE BEEN D. N. A. TESTED 
IS THAT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE 
IT IS WITH THESE BIRDS OBVIOUSLY IF YOU LOOK AT THEM THERE'S NO REAL DISCERNIBLE DIFFERENCE 
SO YOU HAVE TO GET THEM CHECKED THAT WAY 
THE PLAN IS MALES AND FEMALES ARE YOU HOPING YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BREEDING FLOCK 
THAT IS THE PLAN 
BUT SOME OF THE BIRDS PARTICULARLY THE DARKER ONES 
ARE JUVENILES SO IT'LL PROBABLY TAKE A GOOD FOUR OR FIVE YEARS FOR THEM TO MATURE AND SETTLE IN 
HOPEFULLY THEN THEY SHOULD BREED I DO FEEL LIKE I'M IN AN EPISODE OF THE JUNGLE BOOK 
THEY'RE ALL SITTING THERE HUNCHED UP 
THEY'RE JUST INCREDIBLE LOOKING THINGS 
THE FIRST THING YOU NOTICE ABOUT THEM IS REALLY POWERFUL BEAKS AND BALD HEADS 
YES THEY HAVE A BALD HEAD BECAUSE THEY'RE A SCAVENGER AND THEY WOULD COME ACROSS A CARCASS OR SOMETHING 
THAT HAD DIED AND IT ENABLES THEM TO GET THEIR HEADS RIGHT IN AMONGST THE JUICY BITS IF YOU LIKE 
AND NOT GET TOO DIRTY ON TOP OF THEIR HEADS AND ALL MATTED BECAUSE THEY CAN'T CLEAN THEIR HEADS VERY WELL 
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL BEAK 
THEY GO THROUGH EVERYTHING SKIN BONE FLESH THE LOT 
IT'S A VERY VERY STRONG WEAPON THEY'VE GOT 
O. K. WELL I KNOW YOU HAVE A JOB TO DO HERE TODAY 
AND I HAVE A HORRIBLE FEELING YOU'RE GOING TO ASK ME TO HELP WHAT IS IT 
CLEAN UP THE MESS THEY MAKE RIGHT HOW DO WE DO THAT 
PRESSURE WASHER IT'S THE ONLY WAY 
IS THIS GOING TO FREAK THEM OUT 
IT DOES A BIT IF YOU JUST WANT TO PULL THE TRIGGER 
OH MY WORD 
IT'S A BIT POWERFUL IT IS VERY POWERFUL 
DO THEY MIND GETTING WET WHEN THEY'RE FROM SUCH A WARM DRY AREA 
THEY ACTUALLY QUITE LIKE GETTING WET 
GIVES THEM A BIT OF A WASH 
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A VERY NOISY JOB 
AND I THINK IT MAY TAKE ME A LITTLE BIT OF TIME 
BECAUSE I KNOW HOW PICKY MARK IS 
HE'S GOING TO NOT LET ME OUT TILL IT'S PERFECT 
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A PERFECT CLEAN HOUSE BOYS AND GIRLS 
BACK IN KENYA LONGLEAT KEEPER RYAN HOCKLEY AND I ARE OUT ON A SHORT TRAINING RUN 
TOMORROW WE'LL BE FACING 
TWENTY ONE GRUELLING KILOMETRES OF STEEP AND RUGGED TERRAIN WHEN WE TACKLE THE LEWA SAFARICOM HALF MARATHON 
AN ARMED RANGER KEEPS A LOOKOUT TO PROTECT US FROM DANGEROUS ANIMALS 
BUT OF COURSE HERE AS IN MOST PARTS OF AFRICA IT'S THE ANIMALS THAT NEED TO BE PROTECTED 
MANY SPECIES ARE UNDER THREAT FROM HUNTING POACHING AND THE LOSS OF THEIR NATURAL HABITATS 
CHARLIE MAYHEW SET UP THE TUSK TRUST 
THE BRITISH BASED CONSERVATION CHARITY THAT ORGANISES THE LEWA MARATHON 
HE KNOWS WHAT'S AT STAKE 
IT REALLY IS VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THIS MARATHON 
AND THESE FUND RAISING INITIATIVES TO SUPPORT LEWA 
THE COST OF PROTECTING RHINO IN PARTICULAR IS REALLY HUGE 
WITHOUT THE DONOR SUPPORT THEY SIMPLY WOULDN'T BE ABLE 
TO RETAIN THAT SECURITY AND WE'D BE SEEING THE SPECIES DISAPPEARING 
POACHERS ARE THE BIGGEST SINGLE DANGER TO RHINO 
THEIR HORNS ARE WORTH A LOT OF MONEY IN THE MIDDLE EAST WHERE THEY ARE USED FOR CEREMONIAL DAGGER HILTS 
AND IN CHINA WHERE THEY'RE WIDELY THOUGHT TO HAVE APHRODISIAC QUALITIES 
SO TO PROTECT THE RHINO IT'S NECESSARY TO RUN HIGHLY ARMED ANTI POACHING PATROLS 
ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE MONEY RAISED BY THE MARATHON WILL GO TOWARDS MAINTAINING THESE TEAMS 
BUT THE LARGEST PROPORTION OF FUNDS WILL GO TO A VARIETY OF SCHEMES 
THAT AT FIRST GLANCE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ANIMALS AT ALL 
COMMUNITY PROJECTS TO DEVELOP EDUCATION HEALTH CARE WATER SUPPLIES AND THE TOURIST INDUSTRY 
THE IDEA IS TO GET LOCAL PEOPLE TO SUPPORT CONSERVATION IN EVERY WAY 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST SUCCESS STORIES HAS BEEN THE PROJECT AT IL NGWESI 
IN THE MASAI TRIBAL LANDS BORDERING LEWA 
IT'S A TOURIST LODGE SET IN A CONSERVATION GAME PARK 
IL NGWESI IS ENTIRELY OWNED AND RUN BY THE LOCAL MASAI COMMUNITY 
JONATHAN KIP MANAGER OF THE LODGE CAN SEE HOW THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE SAVING THE WILDLIFE 
WE USED TO KILL LIONS BECAUSE THEY WOULD COME AND KILL MY COW 
WHERE AM I GOING TO GET ANOTHER COW 
THE ONLY OPTION WE HAD WAS TO KILL IT GET RID OF IT 
BUT AT THE MOMENT 
OUR LOGO IS A WARRIOR THE ONE WHO USED TO BE THE ENEMY OF A LION 
IT'S A WARRIOR AND A LION A WARRIOR HOLDING A LION AND SAYING WE'RE FRIENDS 
WE'RE FRIENDS BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING A LOT FROM THE WILD ANIMALS 
ANOTHER MEASURE OF IL NGWESI'S SUCCESS IS THE RECENT REINTRODUCTION OF BLACK RHINO 
AFTER DECADES OF POACHING WIPED THEM OUT 
THEY'VE GOT ONLY ONE MALE TO START WITH A YOUNG CHAP CALLED OMNI 
WE'RE SO PROUD OF OMNI NOT ONLY ME BUT THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY LET ALONE GUESTS 
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THE RHINO THE BLACK RHINO BUT THE SECOND THING 
WE ARE THE FIRST COMMUNITY TO HAVE A BLACK RHINO BACK HOME 
THERE WAS A TIME WE HAD SOMEBODY WHO USED TO BE A POACHER 
WE BROUGHT HIM TO SEE OMNI AND WHEN HE TOUCHED OMNI AND SMELT 
HE STARTED CRYING REGRETTING WHAT HE DID 
IN THE WORLD'S POOREST CONTINENT PROJECTS LIKE IL NGWESI DON'T JUST HAPPEN BY THEMSELVES 
IT COSTS MONEY TO GET THEM STARTED 
BACK AT LEWA RYAN HOCKLEY AND I ARE GETTING READY TO DO OUR BIT TO HELP 
BUT NOW THERE'S A PROBLEM 
RICHARD MOLLER THE HEAD OF SECURITY 
HAS SPOTTED SOMETHING THAT COULD PUT THE WHOLE MARATHON IN JEOPARDY 
A PRIDE OF LIONS IS LURKING NEAR THE CAMPSITE JUST TWO HUNDRED METRES FROM THE START LINE 
THOSE LION TRACKS ARE ALL OVER THE ROAD 
IF IT'S THE SAME ONES WE'RE THINKING THERE'S EIGHT 
THERE'S TWO FULLY GROWN LIONESSES 
EACH WITH THREE CUBS 
IF THOSE LIONS HAVEN'T FED FOR A FEW DAYS THEY'RE GOING TO BE HUNGRY 
ONE OF RICHARD'S TEAMS HAS ARRIVED TO TRY AND KEEP TABS ON THE LIONS 
THEY'LL HAVE TO WATCH THEM ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT 
MEANWHILE WE'RE BACK AT CAMP IT'S ALMOST DUSK AND TOMORROW IS THE BIG DAY 
WELL THIS IS IT IT'S THE NIGHT BEFORE THE RACE 
COS AND I HAVE DONE ALL THE TRAINING WE CAN DO 
WE'VE REGISTERED AND NOW ALL THAT'S LEFT IS TO GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP 
COS DO YOU THINK YOU CAN MANAGE THAT 
I THINK I'M GOING TO SLEEP LIKE A BABY TONIGHT 
WHAT ARE YOUR WORST WORRIES ABOUT TOMORROW 
IT GOES ON FOR ABOUT A KILOMETRE AND A HALF THAT'S REALLY GOING TO HURT 
I'M DREADING IT I'M GOING TO HAVE NIGHTMARES ABOUT THAT THAT AND SOME OF THE WILDLIFE 
I'VE GOT ISSUES ABOUT THE LIONS I MUST ADMIT 
WHAT NICE DREAMS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TONIGHT IT'S AN INCENTIVE TO RUN 
BACK IN WILTSHIRE YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ACTUALLY RUNNING INTO A LARGE WILD ANIMAL 
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN EVERYTHING AT LONGLEAT IS PREDICTABLE 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU MIGHT SEE 
I'M OUT ON THE LAKE WITH MICHELLE STEVENS AND WE'RE SO LUCKY 
BECAUSE WE'VE JUST SPOTTED THAT ONE OF THE HIPPOS IS RIGHT OUT 
I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN THIS CLOSE AND THIS FAR OUT BEFORE 
IT'S JUST GREAT I WONDER WHERE THE OTHER ONE MIGHT BE 
IF YOU KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER YOU'LL SEE SOME BUBBLES IN A SECOND OH THERE SHE IS 
OH THAT'S FANTASTIC 
I DO FIND IT AMAZING THAT THESE ARE AFRICAN HIPPOS LIVING IN WILTSHIRE SWIMMING IN VERY COLD WATER 
HOW ON EARTH DO THEY MANAGE TO SURVIVE HERE 
THEY HAVE VERY THICK SKIN 
ALSO THEY DO HAVE A MUD WALLOW IN THAT GRASSY AREA OVER THERE WHICH THEY'VE MADE THEMSELVES 
THE MUD WILL ACT AS A SUNSCREEN BUT ALSO WILL ACT AS AN INSULATOR TO KEEP THEM WARM 
REALLY SO IN THE WINTER WILL THEY GO AND DIG IN THERE 
THEY SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF THEIR TIME JUST LAYING THERE KEEPING WARM 
HOWEVER HAVING SAID THAT THEY LIVE IN VERY WARM CLIMATES IN THE WILD 
THEY CAN BE FOUND IN SOME MOUNTAINOUS AREAS IN AFRICA 
WHICH DO GET QUITE COLD 
SO THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD AT SURVIVING COLD WEATHER 
AMAZINGLY ADAPTABLE YOU JUST THINK OF THEM PURELY AS ANIMALS THAT LIVE SOMEWHERE VERY WARM INDEED 
SO THE MUD AS WELL AS BEING AN INSULATOR 
WHEN YOU SAY IT'S A SUNSCREEN HOW DOES THAT WORK 
THEY PRODUCE THEIR OWN SUNSCREEN IN THE FORM OF A PINK SUBSTANCE WHICH IS EXCRETED FROM THE SKIN 
BUT ALSO THE MUD WILL JUST CAKE ON THEIR SKIN AND DRY 
AND IT PROTECTS THE SKIN FROM BEING BURNT FROM THE SUN 
ONE OF THEM HAD SOME MUD ON THEIR FACE TO KEEP IT LOOKING BEAUTIFUL 
A LITTLE MUD PACK 
MICHELLE IT'S BEEN GREAT TO SEE THEM 
DAWN IN AFRICA IT'S THE MORNING OF THE LEWA MARATHON 
SIX HUNDRED FIFTY RUNNERS AND OVER TWO THOUSAND SPECTATORS ARE GATHERING 
FOR THE START OF ONE OF THE TOUGHEST ENDURANCE RACES IN THE WORLD 
LAST YEAR SEVERAL RUNNERS HAD TO BE GIVEN EMERGENCY MEDICAL ATTENTION 
I ONLY HOPE THAT THIS YEAR RYAN AND I AREN'T AMONG THE CASUALTIES 
IT'S FREEZING 
DID YOU THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE THIS COLD I WASN'T EXPECTING TO SEE MY BREATH 
SO QUITE A SURPRISE 
QUITE A RESTLESS NIGHT LAST NIGHT 
ALL I COULD THINK OF WAS DIFFERENT SCENARIOS AS I WAS RUNNING ALONG 
WHAT SORT OF ANIMALS WOULD I MEET 
WHAT WOULD I DO IF I CAME ACROSS CAPE BUFFALO 
COS I HEARD SOME HORROR STORIES LAST NIGHT ABOUT BUFFALO 
AND HOW AGGRESSIVE THEY CAN BE 
SO THAT TOOK UP MOST OF MY THOUGHTS 
AT LEAST THE PRIDE OF LIONS THAT WAS LURKING IN THE LONG GRASS NEAR THE START LINE HAS MOVED OFF 
BUT THERE ARE STILL ALL SORTS OF DANGEROUS ANIMALS OUT THERE 
ARMED RANGERS A SPOTTER PLANE AND A HELICOPTER HAVE ALL BEEN DEPLOYED TO PROTECT US 
NOW A HERD OF ELEPHANTS HAS WANDERED ONTO THE COURSE 
JUST FIVE HUNDRED METRES FROM THE START LINE AND ALL THE CROWDS 
THE CHOPPER MOVES IN TO DRIVE THEM OFF 
FLYING THE HELICOPTER IS PHIL MATHEWS 
IT'S JUST AS WELL HE'S A VERY EXPERIENCED BUSH PILOT 
IF HE STARTS GOING TOWARDS THE CROWDS 
YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM 
OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT THAT 
SO JUST PUSH THEM AS GENTLY AS POSSIBLE GET THEM AWAY 
LOTS OF DANGERS REALLY 
YOU'RE FLYING LOW LEVEL OBVIOUSLY ALL THE TIME 
SO IN HELICOPTER TERMS YOU'RE IN DEAD MAN'S CURVE ALL DAY 
NOT A HEALTHY PLACE TO BE 
YOU'VE GOT ZERO FORWARD SPEED AND YOU'RE HOVERING BELOW A SAFE ALTITUDE BASICALLY 
SO IF YOUR ENGINE DID COUGH OR STOP 
IT WOULD BE A DIFFICULT ONE TO WALK AWAY FROM 
BUT NOW PHIL HAS MOVED THE ELEPHANTS OFF THE COURSE SO THE RACE IS CLEAR TO BEGIN 
I'VE JUST GOT TIME FOR SOME LAST MINUTE NERVES 
WELL THE ADRENALINE IS BEGINNING TO PUMP 
I'M A BIT NERVOUS BECAUSE I THINK EVERYONE HERE THINKS 
BECAUSE WE BROUGHT A CAMERA WE MUST BE REALLY REALLY GOOD 
IT'S SLIGHTLY WORRYING ISN'T IT 
IT'S SEVEN A M. AND THE LEWA MARATHON IS ABOUT TO BEGIN 
SIX HUNDRED FIFTY HAVE STARTED BUT IT'S EXPECTED 
THAT QUITE A FEW WON'T BE ABLE TO FINISH THIS GRUELLING RACE 
AHEAD OF US ARE SOME OF THE BEST LONG DISTANCE RUNNERS IN THE WORLD 
WE CAN'T HOPE TO KEEP UP WITH THEIR BLISTERING PACE 
LAST YEAR THE WINNER OF THE FULL MARATHON RAN THE TWENTY SIX MILES IN A STAGGERING TWO HOURS NINETEEN MINUTES 
WE'RE HOPING TO FINISH OUR HALF MARATHON IN UNDER THREE HOURS 
THIS IS A RACE AGAINST THE CLOCK IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE 
IT'S COOL NOW BUT SOON THE SUN WILL CLIMB 
HEAT EXHAUSTION AND DEHYDRATION WILL BECOME A VERY REAL DANGER AS THE RACE GOES ON 
THE FIRST WILDLIFE TO CROSS OUR PATH IS A HERD OF STAMPEDING ZEBRA 
THEY'RE NOT TOO MUCH OF A WORRY BUT UP AHEAD THE SPOTTER PLANE HAS SIGHTED A BULL ELEPHANT 
HEADING TOWARDS THE COURSE AT THE THREE KILOMETRE MARK 
HE COULD BE A MUCH BIGGER DANGER 
TIME TO CALL IN THE CHOPPER AGAIN 
WHEN YOU HAVE A STAND OFF IF HE WANTS TO COME A LITTLE BIT 
LET HIM COME AND THEN GO BACK AND CHASE HIM AGAIN 
WE'VE HAD SOME SITUATIONS WITH THEM 
TEARING UNDERNEATH THE HELICOPTER REACHING UP WITH THEIR TRUNK 
TO TRY AND GRAB YOU OUT OF THE AIR 
WITH THEIR TRUNK TRY AND WRAP IT ROUND ONE OF THE SKIDS 
THEY ARE CLEVER ANIMALS 
BUT THE BULL AND HIS HERD MOVE AWAY FROM THE COURSE 
BACK ON THE GROUND RYAN AND I HAVE BEEN RUNNING FOR TWENTY MINUTES NOW 
WE'RE AT THE FIRST WATER STOP 
O. K. FIVE KILOMETRES 
HOW ARE YOU FEELING I FEEL FINE 
WELL DONE KEEP GOING I'M QUITE HAPPY ABOUT THAT 
IT'S VERY HOT 
WE'VE ALREADY HAD TO STOP TO GO TO THE TOILET ONCE ALREADY 
I DIDN'T HAVE TO GO IT'S THE PROBLEM WITH RUNNING IN PAIRS 
BUT WE'VE BEATEN A RHINO 
IF YOU TURN ROUND YOU'LL SEE 
HOW HE'S DOING THAT I HAVE NO IDEA 
WELL DONE RHINO 
HE'S OVERTAKEN US 
I THINK THAT'S OUR CALL WE'VE STILL GOT OVER FIFTEEN KILOMETRES TO GO 
AND NOW WE'RE FINDING OUT JUST HOW FAST IT GETS HOT IN AFRICA 
THE TEMPERATURE IS SOARING SEVERAL RUNNERS HAVE ALREADY COLLAPSED 
AND ARE RECEIVING EMERGENCY MEDICAL ATTENTION IN THE RECOVERY TENTS 
NOW IT'S VITAL FOR RYAN AND ME TO KEEP OUR PACE STEADY 
IF WE'RE TO HAVE ANY HOPE OF REACHING THE FINISH LINE 
AT TIMES THOUGH IT'S DIFFICULT TO CONCENTRATE THERE'S SO MUCH WILDLIFE HERE 
AND THIS OF COURSE IS WHAT THE MARATHON IS ALL ABOUT 
EVERY COMPETITOR IS RUNNING TO RAISE FUNDS TO PRESERVE KENYA'S WILDLIFE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS 
THE TWELVE K. M. WATER POINT IS A WELCOME SIGHT 
REALLY REALLY HOT THE FIELD IS SPREADING OUT QUITE A BIT 
SO WE HAD A BIT OF TIME PRACTICALLY ON OUR OWN OUT THERE 
WHICH WAS GREAT YOU FEEL COMPLETELY 
A VERY SOLITARY FEELING 
AS SOON AS WE WERE ANYTHING MORE THAN A COUPLE OF HUNDRED METRES APART YOU REALLY FEEL ALONE 
MY CALF FEELS A BIT TIGHT 
I'M FEELING A BIT TIGHT ON THE BACK OF MY LEG DOWN THERE 
MY THROAT ISN'T BRILLIANT AND I'M VERY SWEATY 
BUT WE'RE OVER HALFWAY 
WE'VE ONE MORE HILL THEN IT'S MOSTLY DOWNHILL 
MIGHT HELP OUR TIME A LITTLE BIT 
SPEAKING OF WHICH I THINK WE HAVE TO GO 
SEE YOU ALL LATER 
THIS IS WHERE THE GOING GETS REALLY TOUGH 
THE TEMPERATURE IS NOW ALMOST THIRTY DEGREES CENTIGRADE 
AND WE ARE AT OVER ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED METRES AT THIS ALTITUDE THE THINNESS 
OF THE AIR CAN LEAVE EVEN THE FITTEST STRUGGLING FOR BREATH 
IT'S REALLY HURTING ME NOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT COS 
MY LEGS ARE FEELING QUITE TIRED 
AND I THINK I'VE GOT A BIT OF CRAMP 
SOMEWHERE IN MY RIGHT TOES 
BUT IT'S QUITE HARD TO DISTINGUISH WHICH ONES ARE HURTING 
I FEEL THE PRESSURE IS REALLY ON NOW 
BECAUSE THE FULL MARATHON RUNNERS AREN'T QUITE BACK BUT THEY WILL BE ANY MINUTE 
AND WE REALLY WANT TO TRY AND GET BACK 
BEFORE THEM BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN 
THEY'RE GOING TO GO PAST US ANY MINUTE YOU JUST WAIT AND SEE 
WE'RE ON A CIRCULAR COURSE 
THE FULL MARATHON RUNNERS GO AROUND TWICE 
THE QUICKEST OF THE HALF MARATHON COMPETITORS ARE ALREADY HOME 
AND AT THE FINISH LINE CELEBRATIONS HAVE STARTED 
NOW THE FULL MARATHON LEADERS ARE COMING IN 
TIMES ARE REALLY FAST THIS YEAR 
SOME ARE IN BETTER SHAPE THAN OTHERS 
AFTER TWENTY KILOMETRES RYAN AND I ARE ON THE HOME STRETCH 
OUR FINAL TIME IS TWO HOURS AND SEVENTEEN MINUTES 
WE ARE THE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHTH AND TWENTY NINTH PAST THE POST 
NOT BAD FOR TWO NOVICES FROM ENGLAND 
THE LAST TWO KILOMETRES WERE KILLERS 
IT WENT ON AND ON AND ON 
WE SAW SOME ELEPHANTS LOADS OF ELEPHANTS 
IT WAS NICE IT GAVE YOU A SPURT 
THANK YOU 
IT GAVE YOU A SPURT TO GET A MOVE ON BECAUSE YOU COULD SEE 
HOPEFULLY THE BENEFIT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING OUT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU 
SO VERY GOOD 
I'M REALLY PROUD OF MYSELF YEAH 
TO BE HONEST A YEAR AGO I WOULD NEVER HAVE SEEN MYSELF DOING ANYTHING LIKE THIS 
RUNNING UP THE STAIRS WAS AN ISSUE FOR ME A YEAR AGO 
SO TO BE HERE STOOD HERE NOW I'M ELATED 
YOU'VE DONE VERY WELL MATE CHEERS BEN 
WELL DONE YOU REALLY HAVE 
I CAN'T EXPLAIN HOW BEAUTIFUL IT WAS OUT THERE 
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACES AND WHAT A SAFARI 
I THINK WE NEED TO SIT DOWN WE DO EXCUSE US 
SADLY THAT'S THE END OF TODAY'S VERY SPECIAL PROGRAMME 
AND COS AND I HAVE COLLAPSED AFTER COMPLETING THAT HALF MARATHON 
A NICE REWARD WOULD YOU SAY YEAH I'M ENJOYING THIS 
ANY FOND MEMORIES TO TAKE HOME 
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE DAY BEN 
I'LL REMEMBER EVERYTHING FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE 
ME TOO ESPECIALLY THIS MASSAGE 
WHILE WE ENJOY THIS HERE'S WHAT'S COMING UP ON THE NEXT ANIMAL PARK 
I'LL BE IN KENYA HELPING TO CATCH A WILD RHINO 
MY HEART IS POUNDING AWAY THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS ANIMALS IN AFRICA 
AT LONGLEAT I'LL FIND OUT WHY THEY CALL HIM THE EGG MAN 
MARK YOU DEFINITELY HAVE EARNED YOUR TITLE 
AS WELL AS BIG RHINO WE'LL BE MEETING SOME SMALL RHINO 
IT'S FEEDING TIME FOR TWO ORPHANED BABIES TULA AND MAX 
YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT AS WELL 
WE'LL HAVE ALL THAT AND MORE ON THE NEXT ANIMAL PARK
