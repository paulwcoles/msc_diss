IT'S NOT YOUR IMAGINATION IT'S OZONE OZONE OXYGEN O. TWO HAS TWO ATOMS PER 
MOLECULE BUT OZONE IS A SPECIAL 
TYPE OF OXYGEN IT'S GOT THREE 
ATOMS PER MOLECULE WHICH IS WHY 
IT'S REFERRED TO AS O. THREE 
IT FORMS NATURALLY IN THE UPPER 
ATMOSPHERE CREATING A LAYER THAT 
PROTECTS US FROM THE SUN'S HARMFUL 
ULTRA VIELT RAYS CLOSE TO HOME IT 
OCCURS AFTER THUNDER STORMS WHEN 
LIGHTNING CHANGES THE MAKE UP OF 
OXYGEN OXYGEN OZONE IS CHEMICALLY UNSTABLE AND 
THE EXTRA OXYGEN ATOMS TEND TO FLY 
OFF THEY THEN ATTACK AND RUPTURE 
THE CELL WALLLES OF LIVING 
ORGANISMS AS IT OXIDISES IT KILLS 
THEM IN FACT IT'S OVER THREE THOUSAND 
TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE THAN CHLORINE 
BLEACH THAT'S HIGH OZONE IS SO 
GOOD AT KILLING SUPERBUGS LIKE MRSA 
AND CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE 
SO THAT'S THE SCIENCE BIT BUT HERE 
AT RIVERSWAY NURSING HOME IN 
BRISTOL IS WHERE THEY'VE PUT THAT 
THEORY INTO PRACTISE 
MATRON ANGELA GLOVER GETS THE 
LAUNDRY CLEAN BY USING A SPECIAL 
WASHING MACHINE INSTEAD OF HOT 
WATER AND DETERGENT IT USES COLD 
WATER AND OZONE ONE TO KILL 
BACTERIA 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT 
TO ME BACTERIA TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS AN ORGANISM 
FREE AREA BECAUSE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY 
LOTS OF SUPERBUGS ABOUT IF YOU 
HAVE GOT SIXTY NINE RESIDENTS YOU CAN 
IMAGINE THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY THE 
MACHINES ARE WORKING FLAT OUT WERE WERE YOU WORRIED ABOUT SUPERBUGS AND 
INFECTIONS 
THERE'S ALWAYS A WORRY INFECTIONS OF CROSS INFECTION BUT WE CERTAINLY 
HAVE FOUND A HUGE DIFFERENCE SINCE 
WE HAVE BEEN USING 
THE SYSTEM WITH WITH THE NUMBER OF DEATHS LINKED TO 
C.DIFFICILE ON THE INCREASE YOU 
MIGHT THINK THE N. H. S. WOULD BE USING 
THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY BUT IT'S NOT 
THAT SIMPLE HOSPITALS USE HUGE 
MACHINES TO WASH THEIR LINEN AND 
THE TECHNOLOGY ISN'T YET AVAILABLE 
ON THAT SCALE AND THERE'S ANOTHER 
PROBLEM CURRENT N. H. S. GUIDELINES 
STATE THAT LINEN SHOULD BE WASHED 
AT TEMPERATURES ABOVE SEVENTY C. 
OZONE DOESN'T USE TEMPERATURE IT 
RELIES ON 
THE OZONE TO KILL THE 
BACTERIA SO THEREFORE IT DOESN'T 
COMPLY WITH CURRENT GUIDELINES WE 
ARE USING THE SYSTEM HERE IN SEVENTEEN 
HOSPITALS UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY 
BUT IT'S ONLY USED AT THE MOMENT 
FOR CLEANING CLOTHS 
BUT OZONE DOESN'T JUST KILL 
BACTERIA IN THE WASH AT HIGHER 
CONCENTRATION THE PORTABLE OZONE 
MACHINE CAN BE USED TO DISINFECT AN 
ENTIRE ROOM CURTAIN CARPETS THE 
LOT IT'S ALSO EFFECTIVE AT GETTING 
RID OF ODOURS 
SIMILAR TO THE WASHING MACHINE WE 
CREATE OZONE BUT IN A MUCH 
LAFRPBLGER AND CONCENTRATED LEVEL 
AND WHICH PUSH THAT OUT INTO THE 
ROOM AND WHEN IT COMES IN CONTACT 
WITH BACTERIA ON THE SURFACES IT 
KILLS THE BACTERIA LIKE IT DOES IN 
THE WASHING MACHINE 
THIS TECHNOLOGY IS WIPING OUT LIFE 
THREATENING BACTERIA AND BY USING 
LOWER TEMPERATURES AND LESS 
DETERGENT IT'S ALSO BETTER FOR THE 
ENVIRONMENT 
LUCY IS IT THE SOLUTION THEN WHAT 
ARE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SAYING 
ABOUT IT 
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE GOOD 
THINGS TO SAY ABOUT IT ESPECIALLY 
TREATING SUPERBUGS BUT THE N. H. S. 
GUIDELINES STIPULATE THAT LAWN 
TRIHAS TO BE WASHED AT SEVENTY ONE C. AND 
OZONE IS A COLD SYSTEM THAT'S WHY 
THEY ARE NOT USING IT ALSO THE N. H. S. 
IS GEARED UP WITH MASSIVE LAUNDRY 
SYSTEMS SO THERE IS NO 
INFRASTRUCTURE TO USE IT IT'S NOT 
HAD ANY CLINICAL TRIALS YET SO 
THAT'S ANOTHER REASON HIGH IT'S NOT 
BEING EYESED IN ALL HOSPITALS WE WE ARE ALSO CONSCIOUS OF MRSA THAT'S 
THE REASON HOSPITALS HAVE TO BE 
FEARFUL DON'T THEY 
YES IT USED 
TO BE IN THE OLD DAYS CERTAINLY IN 
MY LIFETIME NURSES WERE IN CHARGE 
OF CLEANING IN HOSPITALS THAT WAS 
PART OF YOUR DUTY SO YOU WERE 
BROUGHT UP AND EDUCATED IN THE 
STRICT DISCIPLINES OF CLEANLINESS 
IN HOSPITALS THEN THEY STARTED 
CONTRACTED OUT AS SOON AS THEY 
STARTED DOING THAT THE ROT SET IN 
BECAUSE THINGS WERE NOT AS CLEAN 
BECAUSE PEOPLE WEREN'T AS 
DISCIPLINED AS NURSES WE SHOULD 
PAY THE NURSES IN ADDITION TO WHAT 
THEY ARE BEING PAID NOW 
WHY NOT 
GIVE THE NURSES THE RIGHT TO MANAGE 
THE CONTRACT CLEANERS PROPERLY 
IT'S THE GETTING PEOPLE IN FROM 
OUTSIDE IT'S RIGID DISCIPLINE 
THAT OUGHT TO BE ENFORCED REALLY 
AND NURSES WERE ALWAYS TRAIN AND 
BROUGHT UP IN THAT 
THERE IS SOME 
SUGGESTION THAT IT COULD BE A CURE 
FOR CANCERS 
YES OZONE'S BEEN USED 
AS A COMPLIMENTARY MEDICINE BUT 
IT'S NOT CLINICALLY PROVEN SO IT'S 
STILL IN THAT NICHE IDEA THERE IS 
EVIDENCE TO SHOW IT'S USEFUL FROM 
EVERYTHING TO ECZEMA TO MRSA AND 
THE COMPLIMENTLY TREATMENT FOR 
CANCER 
HOW DO THEY APPLY IT ALL CANCER ALL KINDS OF WAYS THERE IS TALKS OF 
INJECTIONS BUT IT'S NOT CLINICALLY 
PROVEN SO WE ARE WAITING FOR TRIALS 
BEFORE THEY CAN GO ANY FURTHER YOU YOU KNOW IT WORKS 
THERE IS ANECDOTAL 
EVIDENCE THAT'S ALL THEY CAN SAY 
AT THE MOMENT 
DO THEY WIPE IT ON 
YOU CAN WIPE IT THERE ARE ALSO 
INJECTIONS 
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE INJECTIONS COLD IF THERE WAS LIQUID 
GO AND 
GET HIM SOME OZONE GO ON A 
GEOGRAPHY QUESTION FOR YOU YOU 
HAVE PROVED YOUR WORTH IN SCIENCE 
NOW GEOGRAPHY SOME OF SHIRLEY 
VALENTINE WAS FILMED IN MIKINOS 
CAN YOU POINT TO IT 
DOWN DOWN 
DOWN TO THE RIGHT SOMEWHERE UP 
THERE 
THERE MARKS THE SPOT VERY THERE WELL DONE INDEED THERE IS A REASON 
FOR US ASKING 
OUR KNOWLEDGE OF GEOGRAPHY OF THE 
REST OF EUROPE IS TERRIBLE A 
SURVEY SUGGESTS NEARLY HALF OF 
BRITISH ADULTS DON'T KNOW WHERE 
SWITZERLAND AND NEARLY ONE IN TEN 
CAN'T POINT TO FRANCE ON A MAP 
THAT IS SHOCKING IN CASE YOU ARE A 
DIVVIE THAT IS FRANCE THERE I 
DON'T WANT ANYBODY WATCHING THE ONE 
SHOW WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHERE FRANCE 
IS O. K. 
THE BIG PINK BIT 
THAT IS FRANCE ISN'T IT 
CAROLE KIRKWOOD CHECKED IN AT LUTON 
AIRPORT TO CHECK OUT IF THOSE GOING 
ON HOLIDAY HAVE A CLUE WHERE THEY 
ARE ACTUALLY GOING 
WE ALL LOOK FORWARD TO PACKING OUR 
SUITCASES AND HEADING OFF FOR TWO 
WEEKS OF WELL DESERVED RELAXATION 
ON A SANDY BEACH YET IF THESE 
FIGURES ARE TO BE BELIEVED AROUND 
SIXTY PER CENT OF US COULDN'T TRACK DOWN THE 
COSTA DEL SOL AND ONLY HALF OF US 
KNOW WHERE TO FIND THE ALGARVE HAS 
NOBODY BEEN PAYING ATTENTION IN 
GEOGRAPHY LESSONS 
THE FINDINGS OF THE SURVEY DON'T 
SURPRISE ME BECAUSE WE ALL TRAVEL 
MORE NOW WE BELIEVE PEOPLE KNOW 
MORE ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE GOING I 
DON'T THINK IT WORKS LIKE THAT 
FIRST OF ALL THE MAP OF EUROPE HAS 
CHANGED SO MUCH IN THE LAST TEN OR 
FIFTEEN YEARS PEOPLE FIND IT HARD TO 
KEEP U. UP 
HERE AT LUTON IT'S THE 
USUAL THRONG OF PEOPLE DESPERATE TO 
GET AWAY AND WE ARE GOING TO FIND 
OUT IF THEY ARE USELESS WHEN IT 
COMES TO EUROPE DO THEY HAVE THE 
SLIGHTEST IDEA WHERE THEY ARE GOING 
TO END UP BEFORE THEY CHECK IN 
THEIR LUGGAGE LET'S GO FOR AN EASY 
ONE WHERE'S ITALY 
THAT'S FAIRLY 
SIMPLE 
SPOT ON WHEREABOUTS IS SIMPLE POLAND 
I'M NOT SURE 
DON'T LOOK SO POLAND WORRIED 
I JUST JUAN THAT GO ON WORRIED HOLIDAY 
WHERE IS SWEDEN THERE HOLIDAY THERE THAT'S BELGIUM WHERE'S ITALY 
SOMEWHERE SUNNY NO I DON'T KNOW 
WHERE I AM POLAND 
POLAND IS THERE POLAND YOU KNOW YOUR GEOGRAPHY 
CAN YOU FIND MINUTE ORCA YOU ARE 
VERY CLOSE BUT ACTUALLY THAT'S 
MAJORCA MINORCA WHERE'S CORSICA 
NEVER HEARD OF THE PLACE 
WHERE ARE 
YOU GOING STAGS BUDAPEST PLACE BUDAPEST PLACE THE SYMBOL OF HUNGARY 
DOWN DOWN 
DOWN THERE 
TOP OF THE CLASS STAG 
DO FAVOURITE PRAGUE 
PUT IT IN THE 
MIDDLE 
THAT ONE 
OVER HERE YES MIDDLE YES THERE'S YOUR PRIZE WELL DONE 
THANK YOU 
I'M IMPRESSED PEOPLE 
HAVE DONE REALLY WELL BUT ENOUGH 
OF THE HOLIDAY MAKERS NOW ON TO A 
COUPLE THAT REALLY SHOULD KNOW 
WHERE THEY ARE HEADED TWO CABIN 
STAFF DO YOU FLY TO THE CZECH 
REPUBLIC YES 
FIND IT THEN THE REPUBLIC YES THE PILOTS DO THAT I JUST GIVE OUT THE 
TEAS AND COFFEES 
NO THAT'S 
ACTUALLY POLAND I'M GLAD YOU ARE 
NOT PILOTS 
I DON'T FLY THERE HOW HOW SHAMEFUL NONE OF OUR STAFF WOULD 
BE SO DAFT WOULD THEY 
OF COURSE 
NOT 
LUCY AND ME ARE GOING TO DO A NOT LITTLE TEST FOR US LET'S MAKE THE 
TEST A BIT HARD FOR THEM L. THINK 
WE'LL START WITH LUCY PLEASE COULD 
YOU POINT TO HUNGARY ON THE MAP OH OH NO THIS IS SO CRUEL 
WHERE IS IT 
IS IT SOMEWHERE 
JUST POINT AT 
SOMETHING STOP HELPING HER I I THINK IT'S THERE 
AND I BELIEVE YOU 
ARE CORRECT WELL DONE MARVELLOUS 
THANKS FOR THAT YOU HAVEN'T GOT A 
MAP HIDDEN IN THE BUCKET HAVE YOU 
I DIDN'T GET WHERE I AM TODAY

MY BEST PAL 
TOM CHAPMAN 
AT THE END OF THE SHOW 
THERE CAN'T BE MUCH YOU DON'T KNOW 
ABOUT THE POTATO WE HAVE SHOWED 
YOU EVERY VARIETY 
AND SHOWED YOU 
HOW THE SPUD COULD SAVE THE WORLD 
HOW DID IT GET IN IN THE FIRST 
PLACE HOW DID IT BECOME POPULAR 
IT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE MUCH BUT THE 
HUPBLBL POTATO'S PLAYED A MIGHTY 
ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR 
SOCIETY HUMBLE POTATO IT CAME 
FROM SOUTH AMERICA IN THE SIXTEENTH 
CENTURY SPANISH ADVENTURERS WENT 
IN SEARCH OF GOLD BUT CAME BACK 
WITH THE SPUFPLTD HOW IT CAME TO 
ENGLAND IS MUCH LESS CLEAR SPUD 
TRADITION HAS IT THAT SIR WALTER 
RALLY PRESENTED ONE TO QUEEN 
ELIZABETH FIRST SOME FOLK SAY HE 
INTRODUCED IT TO IRELAND MAIN HE 
DID MAYBE HE DIDN'T HISTORIANS 
STILL BICKER ABOUT THAT TO THIS DAY 
BUT WHAT IS TRUE IS THAT IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN 
LEADING HERBALIST MENTIONED THE 
POTATO IN HIS BOOK IT WASN'T 
ALWAYS POPULAR THOUGH FOR ONE 
THING IT WAS THOUGHT UNCHRISTIAN 
BECAUSE IT ORIGINATED FROM 
HEATHEN SOCIETY AND PEOPLE BELIEVED 
YOU HAD TO TREAT IT WITH CAUTION 
BECAUSE ITS LEAVES WERE POISONOUS 
IT WAS HERE IN IRELAND IN THE SEVENTEENTH 
CENTURY THAT THE POTENTIAL OF THE 
POTATO WAS FIRST SPOTTED 
THE POTATO SOON BECAME THE MAIN 
CROP IN IRELAND THEY REALISED THEY 
COULD GET LOT OF POTATOES FROM 
EVEN THE SMALLEST PLOT OF LAND LIKE 
THIS ONE NOW THESE WILL CALLED 
LADY BEDS THE SOIL'S BEEN HEAPED 
UP IN ROWS TO MAKE IT DEEPER AND 
MORE PRODUCTIVE THE POTATO SOON 
BECAME THE MAIN CROP IN IRELAND 
FARMERS IN THE NORTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND BECAME THE NEXT TO GROW IT 
THEN THE SCOTS FOLLOWED THEN TOO 
BECOMING GREAT POTATO PRODUCERS 
THE INCREASED POPULARITY WAS PARTLY 
DOWN TO ITS COST LOOK AT THE 
PRICES IN THIS SHOP WINDOW FROM 
ABOUT NINETEEN TEN THEY ILLUSTRATE AN 
IMPORTANT POINT AT A TIME WHEN 
SAUSAGES WERE EIGHT P. A POUND EGGS WERE 
SIX P. THE POTATO WAS A FARTHING FOR 
STONE SO IT'S EASY TO SEE HOW BY 
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE POTATO HAD 
BECOME A STAPLE FOOD THEY WERE 
CHEAP ABUNDANT AND MOST IMPORTANT 
THEY WERE EASY TO GROW IT BECAME 
THE FOOD OF NATIONS BUT TROUBLE 
WAS LOOMING FOR THE HUMBLE SPUD 
IN THE MID ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINTH CENTURY POTATO 
BLIGHT ANNIHILATED CROPS NINETEENTH 
CENTURY 
IT WAS 
A FUNGUS VISIBLE AS CENTURY A BLACK SCAB ON THE FOLIAGE OF THE 
PLANT BUT WITH RAIN WOULD HAVE 
DRIPPED DOWN INTO THE SOIL AND 
AFFECTED THE TUBE AND THE SOIL IT IT HIT SCOTLAND AND THE NORTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND BUT IT WAS IN IRELAND THAT 
ONE MILLION PEOPLE DIED AND TWELVE 
MILLION PEOPLE LEFT 
THE FAMINE ADDED TO THE EXODUS OF 
PEOPLE TO AMERICA THE FAILURE OF 
THE POTATO CROP WAS PIVOTAL IN THE 
CREATION OF A NEW NATION THE U. S. A. 
WORLD WAR TWO MARKED THE NEXT 
MILESTONE IN THE POTATO'S HISTORY 
AS BRITAIN CAME UNDER ATTACK THE 
RATIONING OF FOOD WAS IMPOSED THE 
GOVERNMENT EVEN RAN A CAMPAIGN 
ASKING PEOPLE TO PLANT POTATOES 
POTATO PEAT AND THE TROOPS WERE 
RALLIED WHILE THE GERMANS STARVED 
THE BRITISH SURVIVED THE POTATO 
HELPED WIN THE WAR 
SINCE THEN THE POTATO'S CONTINUED 
ITS BID TO BE BRITAIN'S TOP VEG 
I'VE COME TO SEE THE LATEST ADVANCE 
IN POTATO VARIETIES YOU COULD SAY 
THE POTATO'S COME FULL CIRCLE AS 
IT'S BEEN DEVELOPED TO RESEMBLE THE 
FIRST SPUDS FROM SOUTH AMERICA 
THIS IS VERY TYPICAL OF THE 
POTATOES IN THE FOOTHILLS OF THE 
ANDES WHERE THEY STILL GROW THE OLD 
VARIETIES BECAUSE OF THEIR FLAVOUR 
AND THEY TEND TO HAVE THIS YELLOW 
FLESH WHICH HAS A FLAVOUR WHICH IS 
CALLED UMARMY IT'S THE FIFTH 
FLAVOUR SENSATION ON YOUR TONGUE 
YOU HAVE SWEET SOUR SALT BUILTER 
AND THEN UMARMY WHICH IS A 
SENSATION THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO 
EAT MORE 
FROM OUTCAST TO FOOD THAT 
FUELLED THE NATIONS TO WINNER OF 
WARS TO BRITAIN'S BEST LOVED 
VEGETABLE VEGETABLE QUICK REMINDER ABOUT THE ANIMAL 
ROAD SHOW COMING TO A TOWN NEAR YOU 
NEXT WEEK COURTESY OF THE ONE SHOW 
WE ARE WILLING TO CHECK OUT YOUR 
PET FOR FREE JUST COME ALONG AND 
SEE THE VETS FOR AN ANIMAL M. ZERO TWO SIX SEVEN 
NEXT TO N. ZERO T. 
M. O. T. CLINICS START AT THREE P. M. BE 
THERE 
TOMORROW IS THE F. A. CUP FINAL AND 
JUST FOR A CHANGE NONE OF THE BIG 
CLUBS ARE IN THERE IT THREATENS 
NOT TO BE BORING NO ONE IS NAILED 
ON TO WIN IT 
IT'S IMPORTANTS MOUTH V. CARDIFF 
NONE HAVE WON THE CUP OR INDEED 
ANYTHING ELSE REALLY SINCE THE 
SECOND WORLD WAR 
MUCH HAS CHANGED 
ABOUT THE GAME SINCE THEN PHIL 
TUFFNELL'S PITTED NEW CLOBBER WITH 
HAVANT AND WATERLOOVILLE 
WE HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED A KILL ABOUT 
HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO THE BALLS 
RANGED FROM PIG'S BLADDERS AND 
STITCHED UP CLOTH TO HUMAN HEADS 
PEOPLE CALLED IT FOOTBALL THE 
BEAUTIFUL GAME IS FAR FROM BEING 
THAT GRUESOME TODAY IT'S THE 
WORLD'S MOST POPULAR SPORT A 
MULTIBILLION POUND INDUSTRY AND THE 
KIT HAS GONE HI TECH I'M GOING TO 
JOIN PLAYERS AT HAVANT AND 
WATERLOOVILLE F. C. FOR A GAME BUT 
FIRST I'M MEETING PETER EVANS FROM 
THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL MUSEUM FOR FOR MUCH OF THE LAST FIFTY YEARS EIGHTEEN PANEL 
BALLS MADE OF LELTER WITH A 
BLADDER WHICH YOU PUNK AND LACE UP 
LEATHER THEY STARTED A POUND IN 
WEIGHT AND THEY DOUBLE OR TREBLE IN 
WEIGHT WHEN THEY GET WET MODERN 
BALLS THESE ARE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT 
THIS IS MAN MADE MATERIALS BECAUSE 
OF THE RUBBERISED COATING 
FOOTBALLERS CAN GET MORE GRIP WITH 
THEIR BOOTS 
A LOT BETTER TO HEAD I 
IMAGINE 
YES THAT ONE COULD KNOCK IMAGINE YOU OUT THAT ONE IS DIFFERENT TWO TWO DIFFERENT SHIRTS 
YES THIS IS A 
HAND KNITTED ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE PROBABLY 
KNITTED BY THE MUM OR GRANDMUM AND 
IT WOULD HAVE GOT WET AND HEAVY AND 
SOAKING IT WOULD HAVE GOT VERY HOT 
IN THE NICER WEATHER 
AND THIS IS 
UP TO DATE 
YES THIS IS MICHAEL UP TO DATE OWEN'S SHIRT AGAINST CROATIA MADE 
OF THIS FANTASTIC MATERIAL CALLED 
ECSTATIC AND IT KEEPS THE PLAYER 
COOL WHEN IT'S HOT KEEPS HIM WARM 
WHEN IT'S COLD KEEPS HIM DRY WHEN 
IT'S WET AND IT'S ANTI BACTERIAL 
THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS THE 
BOOTS LOOK AT THESE FELLAS THEY THEY ARE ROCK HARD PEOPLE OFTEN THINK 
IT'S WOOD OR STEEL IT'S LEATHER 
STUDS EVERYTHING IS LETSER AND 
THEY PROTECTED THE TOP OF THE FOOT 
MORE THAN THE MODERN ONES 
LEATHER 
TIME TO FIND OUT IF THE LEATHER NEW KIT REALLY DOES OUTPERFORM THE 
OLD WE ARE IN TRADITIONAL NINETEEN FORTIES 
GEAR WITH MY TEAM 
THE HAVANT FOOTBALL ACADEMY HAVE 
THE HI TECH KIT THAT MY TEAM 
MEMBERS USUALLY WEAR SEAN YOU 
BOYS WERE REAL HEROES IN ANFIELD 
FOR THE F. A. CUP HOW DO YOU THINK 
YOU WILL FARE IN THIS CLOBBER 
WE'LL STRUGGLE HOW THEY WALKED OR 
PLAYED FOOTBALL IS HARD TO BELIEVE 
WE HAVE STEEL TOE CAPS HERE BOB BOB THE BUILDER'S BOOTS 
LET'S HAVE A 
GO COME ON BOYS 
A LITTLE LESS CONVERSATION 
LITTLE MORE ACTION PLEASE 
HTIONHTION 
UNBELIEVABLE YOU HAVE HTIONHTION GOT NO TOUCH YOU CAN'T TURN OR DO 
ANY TRICKS IN THEM NOT THAT I CAN 
DO ANY TRICKS AND I THINK I'VE GOT 
NAILS IN MY FEET L. WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF I'M BLEEDING IN THERE 
THIS SHIRT'S VERY VERY VERY HOT 
COULDN'T SEE MYSELF LASTING NINETY 
MINUTES AND THE SHORTS ARE VERY 
LONG THE BIGGEST THING IS HAVING 
SOMETHING WRAPPED AROUND YOUR ANKLE 
AT FULL TIME THE SCORE IS ONE TO ONE 
WELL DONE BOYS FOR A BIT OF DRAMA 
WE HAVE SET UP A PENALTY SHOOT OUT 
OLD BALL OLD KIT V. NEW BALL NEW KIT 
LET'S GET IT ON COME ON BOYS IF 
ANYTHING IS GOING TO TEST SKILL 
AGAINST TECHNOLOGY SURELY THIS 
WILL 
OH NO 
THAT'S GONE TO ROW Z. 
NO I THOUGHT ALL THAT AFTER ALL 
THAT IT'S A DRAW IT WASN'T EXACTLY 
A SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT BUT IT 
DOES SHOW THAT SKILL COUNT FORCE 
SOMETHING FANCY ANOTHER NINETY MINUTES 
IN THIS GEAR 
NOT FOR ME NO NO NO NO BETTER GET THESE BOOTS OFF 
WE HAVE GOT THE CUP FINAL TOMORROW 
AND WE HAVE GOT FAN OF PORTSMOUTH AND A FAN OF CARDIFF HERE FROM 
PORTSMOUTH EDDIE YOU ARE 
CONFIDENT YOU ARE FLAPPING 
UNDERNEATH 
I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT UNDERNEATH WE HAVEN'T PLAYED WELL IN THE CUP 
BUT I THINK TOMORROW WILL BE OUR 
DAY I'M PREDICT AGO THREE TO ZERO 
ARE YOU 
REALLY FIGHTING TALK THAT'S WHAT 
I LIKE YOUR GRANDAD WASN'T BORN I 
SUPPOSE WHEN CARDIFF WERE LAST 
THERE MARK HOW DO YOU FEEL 
CONFIDENT TOO IT'S THE YEAR OF THE 
UNDERDOG AND PORTSMOUTH HAVE 
KNOCKED OUT MANCHESTER UNITED AND 
BARNSLEY KNOCKED OUT CHELSEA HE HE SAYS THREE TO ZERO WHAT DO YOU THINK TWO TO ONE TWO TO ONE WE CAN ASK TOM FOR HIS PREDICTION 
BUT WE HAVE SOMEONE EVEN WISER WE 
HAVE OUR OWN ONE SHOW PUNDIT NOT 
ONLY IS HE GOING TO PREDICT WHO'S 
GOING TO WIN HE'LL GET THE SCORE 
RIGHT PRETTY IMPRESSIVE TIME TO 
MEET HIM IT'S TREVOR THE FOOTBALL 
PREDICTING HAMSTER AND WE HAVE HIS 
OWNER HERE POPPY PUT HIM IN THE 
ARENA THERE WE ARE GOING TO SET 
POPPY RUNNING AND WHEREVER HE 
FINISHES AFTER TEN SECONDS THAT'S 
WHERE THE SCORE IS GOING TO BE IN 
REHEARSAL HE DID POO ON CARDIFF 
HE'S STICKING TO PENALTIES IT'S 
LOOKING IN PORTSMOUTH'S FAVOUR OH 
WHAT WAS IT 
IT WAS EITHER TWO TO ONE TO 
PORTSMOUTH OR PENALTIES I THINK L. 
THINK IT WAS TWO TO ONE TO PORTSMOUTH 
QUITE POSSIBLY YES 
WE THINK THAT'S JUST BIT OF FUN 
BUT FOR FOOTBALL FANS HE'S REALLY 
THINKING HARD ABOUT THAT HE THINKS 
IT REALLY MIGHT BE TWO TO ONE TO 
PORTSMOUTH THAT'S IT TONIGHT
