THE B. B. C. YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR COMPETITION 
IS BRITAIN'S MOST PRESTIGIOUS CONTEST FOR YOUNG CLASSICAL PERFORMERS 
THE COMPETITION IS DIVIDED INTO FIVE CATEGORIES 
STRING WOODWIND BRASS PERCUSSION AND KEYBOARD 
ALL THE COMPETITORS 
HAVE TO PERFORM IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE AND A PANEL OF JUDGES WHO HAVE THE POWER TO TRANSFORM 
ONE OF THEIR LIVES FOR EVER AT THIS STAGE 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR ONE FINALIST WHO'LL STAND UP 
WITH THE B. B. C. NATIONAL ORCHESTRA OF WALES IN THE MILLENNIUM CENTRE IN FRONT OF A HUGE AUDIENCE 
AND THEY NEED TO REALLY CAPTIVATE 
AND SELL THE PIECE THEY'RE PLAYING 
SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR THAT SPARK 
THERE ARE JUST FIVE PLACES UP FOR GRABS IN THE GRAND FINAL 
ONE FOR THE WINNER OF EACH OF THE CATEGORIES 
THAT JOURNEY BEGINS WITH A CONTEST BETWEEN FOUR OF BRITAIN'S MOST TALENTED YOUNG WOODWIND PLAYERS 
WINNING THE TITLE OF YOUNG MUSICIAN WOULD JUST BE OUT OF THIS WORLD 
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE 
NOW THAT I'M HERE I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A CHANCE HOWEVER SMALL 
THEY'VE GOT TO SEE SOMETHING IN YOU TO PUT YOU THERE 
THERE ARE THREE OTHER AMAZING MUSICIANS 
WHO HAVE AS MUCH CHANCE AS I DO OF GETTING THROUGH 
THE WINNER OF THE WOODWIND CATEGORY WILL GO ON TO THE GRAND FINAL THIS SUNDAY 
WHEN THE BEST OF THE BEST WILL BATTLE IT OUT TO BE CROWNED 
B. B. C. YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
AND 
JOSEPH SHINER 
DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
AND THE FOUR WOODWIND FINALISTS HAVE JUST BEEN ANNOUNCED 
WHAT AM I DOING 
OH MY GOD 
MOST OF THE LUCKY FOUR HAVE LONG BEEN FRIENDS 
NOW THEY FACE WEEKS OF INTENSE WORK BEFORE THEY'RE PITCHED AGAINST EACH OTHER AT THE WOODWIND FINAL 
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE I'VE GOT TO DO SOME WORK NOW OH GOD 
WE'RE ALL REALLY GOOD FRIENDS AND WE STICK TOGETHER 
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A COMPETITION BECAUSE I'M WITH MY FRIENDS 
IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE GETTING THIS FAR I NEVER DREAMT OF GOING FURTHER 
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE 
I SUPPOSE WINNING THE WHOLE THING WOULD BE YOU KNOW THE ULTIMATE 
YEAH ALL MY HARD WORK HAS COMPLETELY PAID OFF 
IT WOULD MEAN SO MUCH TO ME IT'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY ISN'T IT 
I'D TAKE IT WITH ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE 
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD DAVID SMITH 
IS SOMETHING OF A STAR AT SAINT MARY'S SCHOOL OF MUSIC IN EDINBURGH 
THOUGH HE CAME TO MUSIC LATE DAVID HAS RISEN FAST 
HE'S BEEN PLAYING HIS INSTRUMENT THE FLUTE FOR LESS TIME 
THAN THE OTHER THREE FINALISTS 
I'VE BEEN AT THIS SCHOOL FOR FOUR YEARS NOW 
I NEVER FOUND ANYTHING THAT I REALLY WANTED TO DO UNTIL I STARTED PLAYING THE FLUTE WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN 
SO I'M STUCK WITH IT I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING I'M PLAYING THE FLUTE 
I'M DETERMINED 
BASED ON HEY 
DOES ANYONE NEED ANY HELP 
WHEN HE'S NOT PRACTISING OR GOING TO LESSONS DAVID HELPS OUT WITH THE YOUNGER CHILDREN 
MOSTLY BUDDING MUSICIANS THEMSELVES 
YEAH YEAH WE'RE DAVID'S FAN CLUB 
DAVID WHAT ROUND ARE YOU IN NOW 
THE CATEGORY FINALS 
THERE'S FOUR WOODWIND PLAYERS 
EVERY CATEGORY LIKE BRASS AND PERCUSSION AND PIANO THEY ALL HAVE FOUR PLAYERS AS WELL 
WE'RE COMPETING TO GET THROUGH TO THE BIG GRAND FINAL 
IS THERE ANYONE YOU KNOW YEAH MELANIE AND ANKE AND JOE SHINER 
EVERYONE KNEW EACH OTHER IN THE SEMIFINALS AND I WAS KIND OF LEFT OUT 
I HADN'T BEEN IN FOR ANY COMPETITIONS AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT ME 
BUT IT WAS SO NICE TO HAVE THE OTHER THREE THEY'RE SO LOVELY 
WILL I HAVE TO SHOW MY OUTFIT FOR PERFORMING TO YOUS FOR THE ALL CLEAR 
YES ARE YOU GOING TO WEAR YOUR UGG BOOTS 
MY UGG BOOTS NO DON'T THINK SO I'LL TRY AND GET A PAIR OF GUCCI SHOES WHICH'LL LOOK REALLY FUNKY 
REALLY COOL HE WILL WIN HE WILL WIN HE'S GONNA WIN 
WE HEAR YOU PRACTISING NEXT DOOR IN MATHS SOMETIMES 
I PRACTISE NEXT DOOR A LOT DON'T I YEAH IT'S MY FAVOURITE ROOM IS IT 
THIS YEAR I WASN'T ACTUALLY GOING TO ENTER 
JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE DEADLINE FOR APPLICATIONS I WAS STILL GOING ROUND SAYING NO I'M NOT DOING IT 
WHEN YOU PLAY THE FLUTE FOUR YEARS YOU DON'T THINK OH I'M GONNA TAKE UP A MAJOR COMPETITION 
THE SHOWCASE PIECE DAVID'S BEEN WORKING ON FOR THE WOODWIND FINAL 
PACKS A FEW SURPRISES 
I PLAY A PIECE CALLED ZOOM TUBE 
IT'S LIKE A BLUES FUNKY JAZZ INFLUENCED PIECE 
YOW 
HOW OFTEN DO YOU HEAR SOMEONE SCREAM DOWN A FLUTE NOT VERY OFTEN 
I LOVE PUTTING THAT INTO A PROGRAMME AND SEE AN AUDIENCE'S FACE LIGHT UP 
I THINK IT REPRESENTS ME AS A PERSON AS WELL 
ANKE BATTY THE CLARINET PLAYER IS REALLY FUNNY WE HAD SUCH A GOOD NIGHT WITH HER WHEN WE GOT THROUGH 
I DIDN'T KNOW HIM BEFORE THE COMPETITION HE'S SO NICE 
AND SO UM 
SO CAMP AS WELL IT'S WONDERFUL 
THE CLARINET OCCUPIES A SPECIAL PLACE IN THE LIFE OF EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD ANKE BATTY 
NOT LEAST BECAUSE SHE'S THE ONLY ONE OF THE FOUR FINALISTS WHO DOESN'T GO TO A MUSIC SCHOOL 
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT MUSIC WAS LIKE MY RELEASE 
I THOUGHT THAT IF I ACTUALLY WENT AND STUDIED MUSIC 
THEN IT WOULDN'T BE A RELEASE ANY MORE IT WOULD BE A TASK 
I REALLY COULDN'T BEAR THE THOUGHT THAT I WOULD START RESENTING THE CLARINET 
BECAUSE I HAD TO DO IT 
SO I THOUGHT I'D QUITE LIKE TO GO TO UNI AND DO SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
THE KILLING OF SLAVES WE LOOKED AT DIRECT AND INDIRECT CAUSATION THE INFLICTION OF HARM 
I'M IN MY SECOND TERM OF LAW WITH LAW STUDIES IN EUROPE IN OXFORD 
IT'S BEEN QUITE TOUGH ACTUALLY 
THEY EXPECT US TO DO FORTY FIVE HOURS A WEEK 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP WITH THAT 
AND I END UP GOING TO THE LIBRARY SOMETIMES FOR TEN HOURS AT A TIME 
TUESDAYS ARE REALLY HECTIC 
BECAUSE I USUALLY HAVE TWO ESSAY DEADLINES 
THEN I'VE GOT A GERMAN CLASS FROM FOUR TILL SIX 
AND THEN I'VE GOT ORCHESTRA FROM SEVEN TILL TEN 
AND THEN SOMETIMES I GO OUT AFTER THAT SO IT'S QUITE A LONG DAY 
COS I USUALLY END UP GETTING UP AT FIVE 
THIS WAY 
I NEVER HAD TO WORK THAT HARD AT PLAYING THE CLARINET 
I JUST PICK IT UP AND I WORK AT IT 
UNTIL I CAN PLAY IT THE WAY I LIKE IT AND IT DOESN'T STRESS ME OUT 
AND THIS IS MY ROOM 
I CALL THAT MY CLARINET CORNER AND I'VE GOT A BEAN BAG 
WHICH I GOT THIS TERM BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED A BEAN BAG IN MY ROOM 
MUSIC IS THE BEST PART OF BEING AT UNI 
BECAUSE I WILL GET BACK FROM THE LIBRARY AND I'LL FEEL REALLY 
REALLY AWFUL AND I'LL COME BACK IN HERE 
AND THEN I'LL PLAY CLARINET AND I'LL FEEL GOOD AND I'LL FEEL LIKE I'M GOOD AT SOMETHING 
BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE HERE IT'S REALLY REALLY HARD TO KEEP YOUR SELF ESTEEM 
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE 
IN THIS COMPETITION WE ALL KNOW EACH OTHER 
BECAUSE MOST OF US WERE FROM NYO THE NATIONAL YOUTH ORCHESTRA 
I REMEMBER MY FIRST NYO SECTIONAL 
I WAS ON THE END ALL LITTLE AND VERY SCARED 
AND I REMEMBER ANKE WAS SO SUPPORTIVE 
JOE WAS ALWAYS THE LITTLE BROTHER OF THE CLARINET SECTION ACTUALLY 
WHO YOU'D SORT OF PAT ON THE HEAD AND SAY HEY JOE 
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD JOSEPH SHINER BOARDS AT WELLS CATHEDRAL SCHOOL IN SOMERSET 
IT'S A SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOL 
SO JOE CAN CONCENTRATE ON HIS CLARINET 
TO BE PRACTISING BY SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY FIVE EIGHT A M. RELIGIOUSLY EVERY WEEKDAY 
IS ALMOST HARDER THAN THE BREATHING EXERCISES 
AND THE ACTUAL FACING OF THE PIECES' 
RIZLA IS KIND OF LIKE A TOOTH GUARD 
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING LOTS OBVIOUSLY 
THE TEETH MAKE A GROOVE IN YOUR LIP 
SO IT'S TO PROTECT AGAINST THAT A BIT 
YOU KNOW DOING THREE FOUR HOURS OF PLAYING A DAY 
IT GETS QUITE WEARING AND SOMETIMES HURTS A BIT 
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME 
JOE HAS SET HIS SIGHTS ON BECOMING YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR 
I WAS VERY SMALL WHEN I DID IT BEFORE I WAS ONLY TWELVE OR THIRTEEN AND I DIDN'T GET PAST THE FIRST ROUND 
THIS COMPETITION I'VE GOT SUCH BIGGER BREADTH OF REPERTOIRE 
THAT I CAN CHOOSE FROM JUST COS I'VE PLAYED MORE I'VE LEARNT MORE PIECES I'VE PERFORMED MORE 
I MIGHT DO SOME DEBUSSY ACTUALLY WHICH IS IN MY FINAL PROGRAMME 
I DON'T THINK CLARINET REPERTOIRE CAN GET MUCH BETTER THAN THIS PERSONALLY 
THERE'S JUST SO MUCH DETAIL IT'S UNTRUE 
AND THE FIRST THREE NOTES ARE HARD 
IT LOOKS SO SIMPLE BUT IT'S THE FIRST THING THE JUDGES WILL HEAR 
WHEN I PLAY 
JUST PRACTISING THAT JOIN OVER THE BREAK IS QUITE TEDIOUS 
BUT IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE 
LOOKS LIKE A GOOD PLACE TO STOP 
COOL 
THERE IS SUCH A THING AS GOOD AND BAD PRACTICE I THINK 
IT'S ALWAYS BETTER TO DO NOT AS MUCH BUT VERY FOCUSED PRACTICE 
IF I FEEL I'VE ACHIEVED SOMETHING THEN I'LL HAVE NO QUALMS 
ABOUT LEAVING AFTER AN HOUR OR EVEN FORTY FIVE MINUTES IF I FEEL I'VE MADE SOME PROGRESS 
WHEREAS IF I SLOG AWAY FOR TWO HOURS AND DON'T FEEL I'VE GOT ANYWHERE 
I DO TEND TO GET VERY ANNOYED 
HOW MUCH PRACTICE I DO ENTIRELY DEPENDS ON WHAT I HAVE THAT DAY 
HOW MANY REHEARSALS I HAVE HOW MANY MUSIC LESSONS I HAVE THAT DAY 
JOE GETS SINGLED OUT IN HIS MUSIC NOTATION CLASS ONE WONDER IF OUR CAMERAS HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT 
THANK YOU CAN YOU JUST PUT IN THE TOP PART 
HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO PUT THE QUAVER RESTS IN 
I'M NOT SURE IF THE FACT THAT I'M GOING TO BE PLAYING IN THE FINAL AND IT'LL GO OUT IN THREE WEEKS 
HAS DAWNED YET 
I THINK IT WILL 
ONCE I ACTUALLY GET TO CARDIFF 
WHEN'S THE NEXT STAGE THE WEDNESDAY AFTER HALF TERM 
WHEN JOE ENTERS SOMETHING YOU JUST SHOULDN'T ENTER IT YOU'VE GOT NO CHANCE HE'S A BIT GOOD THIS ONE 
ESPECIALLY AT MY SCHOOL I REALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE AN OUTSIDER AT ALL 
YOU KNOW COMING UP TO B. B. C. WHERE I'VE BECOME SORT OF A SOCIAL RECLUSE 
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT I'M REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT IT 
AND SO THEY APPRECIATE SORRY I CAN'T COME IN TO TOWN I CAN'T COME OVER 
BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO PRACTISE 
BUT SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD MEL ROTHMAN KEEPS HAVING HER OBOE PRACTICE INTERRUPTED 
THIS IS WHEN THE PROBLEMS ARISE 
BASICALLY AN OBOIST IS COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON HOW THEIR REED IS IF THE REED'S NOT VERY NICE 
YOU SOUND HORRIBLE 
IF IT'S NOT VERY RESPONSIVE 
IT MEANS YOU CAN'T PLAY QUIETLY OR VERY EASILY 
JUST EVERYTHING COUNTS ON IT 
SO BASICALLY BEFORE A PERFORMANCE 
THE THING I'M MOST NERVOUS ABOUT IS THAT STUPID THING 
THAT ONE'S RUBBISH THAT ONE'S RUBBISH THAT ONE'S RUBBISH 
BRILLIANT 
ACTUALLY THOSE TWO ARE QUITE GOOD BUT I'M NOT PLAYING THEM 
BECAUSE THEY'RE TO BE SAVED FOR THE CATEGORY FINAL 
BASICALLY ALL OF MY WEEK IS TAKEN UP DOING MUSIC AND PRACTISING 
SOMETIMES IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO MOTIVATE YOURSELF 
BUT YOU'VE JUST GOT TO PUSH REALLY HARD 
PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS TOLD ME 
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE TALENTED YOU'VE GOT TO WORK MORE 
WHICH IS TRUE YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP UP WITH IT 
EVEN THOUGH THE OBOE USED TO BE A HOBBY IT'S BECOME MY LIFE NOW 
AND I ENJOY IT PERHAPS EVEN MORE THAN I DID BEFORE WHEN IT WAS A HOBBY 
BECAUSE IT'S PART OF ME NOW I THINK 
ALMOST LITERALLY 
SO I DON'T KNOW 
MEL WENT THROUGH A VERY DIFFICULT TIME DURING THE EARLY AUDITION ROUNDS 
HER MOTHER WAS SERIOUSLY ILL 
MY MUM DIED THE DAY BEFORE MY SECOND ROUND 
UM 
MY FAMILY ARE SORT OF SAYING TO ME IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO YOUNG MUSICIAN THAT'S FINE 
AND OF COURSE YOU THINK IF THAT HAPPENS TO YOU WHY WOULD YOU GO AND DO AN AUDITION THE NEXT DAY 
WHAT'S THE POINT IN DOING THAT WHEN YOU'RE GRIEVING ABOUT SOMETHING 
BUT I WENT THERE AND JUST WANTED TO DO IT FOR HER 
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY I GOT THROUGH BECAUSE I KNOW MY OBOE PLAYING WASN'T GREAT THAT DAY 
BUT I THINK I HAD A DEPTH OF EMOTION THAT PERHAPS OTHER PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY 
I THINK IT HELPS THE GRIEF BECAUSE PLAYING IS SUCH A PERSONAL THING IT'S LIKE SINGING TO SOMEONE 
IT'S YOUR OWN VOICE AND I SHOWED MY EMOTIONS 
AND I SUPPOSE THAT KIND OF HELPED ME TO GET IT OUT AS IT WERE 
ARCHIE YOU'RE GONNA GET YOUR HAIR TAKEN OUT 
ARCHIE ARCHIE ARCHIE 
THERE'S A GOOD BOY 
I DON'T GET INVOLVED IN THE ACTUAL MUSIC AT ALL 
THAT WOULD NOT BE THE RIGHT THING 
BECAUSE I'VE GOT NO QUALIFICATION TO DO THAT 
DAD KEEPS OUT OF MY WAY 
IT'S JUST REALLY TRYING AS A FATHER 
HAVING KNOWN HER FOR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN YEARS 
JUST NEED TO HELP TO CALM HER DOWN 
AND GET HER TO FOCUS ON THE PERFORMANCE 
SHE MAY GIVE HER BEST PERFORMANCE AND MAYBE SHE WON'T 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS 
BUT THAT'S BEING IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS I GUESS 
WE'RE ALL TALKING OVER THE INTERNET BECAUSE EVERYBODY OUR AGE IS ADDICTED TO FACEBOOK 
YOU CAN SEE ALL THE YOUNG MUSICIAN PEOPLE MESSAGING ONE ANOTHER 
THE WOODWIND CATEGORY IS THE BEST CATEGORY COS THERE JUST SEEMS TO BE 
MUCH MORE FRIENDLY AND CLOSE BONDS BETWEEN THE PLAYERS IN THE WOODWIND SECTION 
OH THERE'S ANKE 
DOESN'T WANT TO DO THE TUTORIALS THIS WEEK 
I'M PROBABLY GOING TO WRITE ON JOE SHINER'S WALL JUST TO COMPARE NOTES 
I HAVEN'T WRITTEN ON HIS WALL FOR AGES I THINK IT'S A GOOD BUNCH 
IN THE FINAL THIS YEAR BECAUSE WE ALL GET ON REALLY WELL 
AND SO IT WON'T BE TOO TENSE HOPEFULLY 
I'VE GOT EXAMS AT THE END OF THIS TERM 
AND IF I DON'T PASS THOSE EXAMS 
I DON'T STAY IN OXFORD 
SO I WANT TO PRACTISE 
BUT THEN I HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH MY WORK 
WITH LESS THAN A FORTNIGHT TO GO ANKE IS STILL STRUGGLING WITH ONE OF THE PIECES 
SHE'LL BE PLAYING IN THE WOODWIND FINAL 
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE ONE OF THEM 
BUT THE OTHER ONE IS JUST REALLY DIFFICULT 
SO HOPEFULLY I'LL LEARN TO LOVE IT BEFORE THE COMPETITION 
THE ONE I'M GOING TO NEED TO LEARN TO LOVE IS THE ABIME DES OISEAUX 
BY MESSIAEN 
AND I'M GETTING THERE ACTUALLY 
I TEND TO GO 
FOR NOT VERY SERIOUS PIECES 
AND I THOUGHT WELL IF I DO GET THROUGH 
I SHOULD PROBABLY DO SOMETHING THAT SHOWS THAT I CAN DO SERIOUS 
IT'S SORT OF THIS SLOW MELANCHOLIC TUNE 
WHICH IS MEANT TO STOP TIME 
AND IT'S JUST SO SLOW AND SO PAINFUL AND SO DESOLATE REALLY 
AND GETS LOUDER AND LOUDER 
COS IT'S NOT SO MUCH MY PERSONALITY 
FINDING THAT IN MYSELF IS QUITE DIFFICULT 
IAN CLARKE THE COMPOSER OF ZOOM TUBE IS COMING TO DO A MASTER CLASS SORT OF THING 
I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY THE PIECE TO HIM BECAUSE I'VE GOT A PARTICULAR APPROACH TO IT 
I DON'T WANT TOO MUCH TO CHANGE ABOUT IT JUST BEFORE THE COMPETITION 
IT'S NICE TO KEEP THAT LITTLE SPARK DON'T WANT IT TO DIE DON'T WANT ME TO GET UNCONFIDENT ABOUT IT 
I JUST LOVE THINGS THAT ARE NEW AND DIFFERENT 
I DON'T MIND IF IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE ME O. K. I WANT IT TO SOUND LIKE YOU THAT'S GOOD 
BUT COMPOSER IAN CLARKE TRIES TO CHIP AWAY AT DAVID'S FLAT REFUSAL TO PLAY IT 
YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY ZOOM TUBE TO ME NO 
IT'S A REALLY INDIVIDUAL PIECE 
YOU MUST HAVE WROTE IT VERY INDIVIDUALLY IT'S VERY WHEN I FIRST WROTE IT 
I DIDN'T EXPECT ANYONE ELSE TO PLAY IT 
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY IT TO ME 
BUT IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO COMMENT ON WOW THAT'S FANTASTIC HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF DOING THIS 
AND YOU CAN TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT I DON'T WANT TO BREAK YOUR SPELL 
O. K. 
I'LL DO IT LET'S GO FOR IT 
I'M GONNA KEEP THIS JUST IN CASE I FORGET SOMETHING NEED HINTS 
I WAS KIND OF TERRIFIED ACTUALLY 
TO KNOW THAT I WAS GOING IN THERE AND SOMEONE WHO'S COMPOSED THIS PIECE AND TOTALLY CHANGED MUSIC 
FOR FLUTE ESPECIALLY 
YOU DID IT I MUCKED UP A LITTLE BIT THAT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER 
YOU DO PLAY IT REALLY WELL 
I MEAN I DIDN'T REALLY EXPECT ANYTHING ELSE 
WHEN YOU GET INTO A GROOVE 
THAT'S COOL 
YOU CAN SAY LOOK WE'VE GOT A GROOVE 
I'M PLAYING A CONTEMPORARY PIECE AND IT HAS A SENSE OF PULSE WHAT ABOUT THE MULTIPHONICS IN THE 
THAT'S IT I NEVER NOTICED THAT BEFORE NOT EVEN A WEE BIT 
I'M REALLY IMPRESSED WITH MEL SHE'S ONE OF THE MOST NATURAL MUSICIANS 
I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE 
VERY VERY TALENTED 
EVERY SATURDAY I COME TO THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF MUSIC FOR THE JUNIOR ACADEMY 
I HAVE A MUSIC CLASS IN THE MORNING AND I HAVE A QUINTET MY CHAMBER MUSIC GROUP 
AND ALSO AN ORCHESTRA AND CHOIR WHICH I PLAY IN 
IT'S GOOD FUN 
I'VE GOT ELEVEN DAYS 
UNTIL TWENTIETH FEBRUARY WHICH IS THE SCARIEST DATE IN MY DIARY 
YEUGH 
IN THE CATEGORY FINAL 
I'M STARTING WITH THESE TWO BAROQUE MOVEMENTS FROM A SONATA BY TELEMANN 
TO INTERPRET IN THE RIGHT WAY AND USE THE DYNAMICS WISELY IS A DIFFICULT THING 
OH IT'S TIRING THE SECOND MOVEMENT 
WHICH IS A LOT FASTER 
IS JUST SO HARD FOR BREATHING 
I'M CONCENTRATING ON THE BREATHING SO I'M NOT REALLY PLAYING THE PHRASES AS WELL AS I COULD BE 
AND THEN I'M PLAYING A SONG BY SCHUMANN AND BECAUSE IT'S A SONG AND IT WASN'T WRITTEN FOR AN INSTRUMENT 
IT'S HARD TO PULL OFF 
I HAVE TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF A VOICE 
OR SOMETHING THAT IS TO BE SUNG 
I'M FINISHING WITH THIS BLUESY PIECE 
WHICH IS JUST CRAZY IT GOES SO FAST AT THE END 
BLEUGH 
I TRY NOT TO DO MORE THAN TWO OR THREE HOURS 
BECAUSE BY THAT POINT MY LIPS ARE COMPLETELY GONE 
I CAN'T REMEMBER 
I HATE THAT ONE 
IT'S TOO HARD 
MEL SHE'LL HATE ME FOR SAYING THIS BUT SHE IS COMPLETELY BONKERS 
COMPLETELY OFF HER TROLLEY BUT I LOVE HER FOR IT 
SHE'S JUST A LOVELY LOVELY PERSON 
JOE'S A REALLY GOOD FRIEND WE WERE IN THE NATIONAL CHILDREN'S ORCHESTRA TOGETHER ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO 
AND NOW WE'RE IN THE NATIONAL YOUTH ORCHESTRA TOGETHER WE'RE THE SAME AGE AND BOTH GO TO MUSIC SCHOOLS 
SO WE KNOW HOW IT FEELS 
IN A PRACTICE ROOM IT'S VERY STERILE 
THERE'S ONLY ONE POINT OF VIEW WHEREAS IF YOU'RE PLAYING TO A TEACHER IN A LESSON OR A FRIEND 
YOU GET DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW AND IDEAS 
AND YOU KNOW OH WELL MAYBE I COULD TRY PLAYING IT LIKE THAT 
THREE FOUR FIVE SIX ONE TWO THREE 
THE TASK AHEAD FOR JOE 
IT'S THE DEBUSSY AND IT'S THE NUANCE 
THE DIFFICULT THING ABOUT THIS PIECE FOR THE CLARINETTIST IS CONTROL 
AND INTONATION 
WHEN YOU TAKE A BREATH AND YOU COME BACK IN BE CAREFUL THAT THERE'S NO BUMP AND IT DOESN'T GO SHARP 
LOVELY ALL RIGHT LET'S GO FROM ONE 
NICE 
COME ON COME ON 
BACK 
GOOD 
NOW KEEP COMING KEEP COMING 
KEEP COMING 
AND 
NOW PUSH 
RELAX 
GOOD NOW GENERALLY I WOULD SAY WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PLAY A BIT MORE 
TO THE HALL WE'RE GONNA PLAY IN RATHER THAN THIS ONE A BIT LOUDER EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE BIGGER 
THIS HALL IS GONNA SUCK ALL OF THE NUANCE OUT OF YOUR PROGRAMME SO YOU'LL HAVE TO PUT IN A BIT MORE 
THERE ARE THREE PREREQUISITES FOR BEING A MUSICIAN TALENT DISCIPLINE AND INTELLIGENCE 
JOE HAS GOT ALL OF THOSE AND YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW RARE IT IS 
TO FIND ALL THREE IN THE SAME PLACE I'M GONNA BLUSH 
NO 
OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU'RE NERVOUS YOU DON'T TAKE ENOUGH BREATH IN 
SO YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER TO ALWAYS BREATHE 
I FIND A KIND OF STATE OF RELAXED CONCENTRATION DURING THE PERFORMANCE 
IF I KNOW THAT I'VE ENJOYED IT THEN I KNOW MY TIME HAS NOT BEEN WASTED AND THE AUDIENCE'S TIME 
AND WELL SPENT MONEY HAS NOT BEEN WASTED 
I'M NOT SURPRISED HE'S GOT THIS FAR IF HE GETS THROUGH TO THE FINAL I'LL BE VERY PROUD OF HIM 
AND IF HE DOESN'T I STILL COULDN'T BE PROUDER AND I PREDICT GOOD THINGS FOR HIM 
I LOVE THE WAY THAT THEY'RE RUNNING 
GUYS I CAN'T RUN IN HEELS YOU KNOW 
WHEN I PLAY I HAVE A DIFFERENT SIDE TO MY PERSONALITY 
WHICH IS KIND OF THE PERSON I WAS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER 
I USED TO BE A COMPLETE INTROVERT I WOULDN'T TALK TO ANYBODY 
THESE GUYS HAVE ORGANISED A PARTY FOR ME 
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING 
IF I KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH BY NOW IT SHOULD BE GOOD 
AS I GREW UP I JUST DECIDED THAT IT'S ACTUALLY MORE FUN 
TO HANG AROUND WITH PEOPLE BUT WHEN I PLAY THE CLARINET 
I ACTUALLY THINK THAT I END UP PORTRAYING THE PART OF ME THAT'S QUITE SENSITIVE 
HELP IS THERE A PAVEMENT SOMEWHERE 
I FEEL THINGS A LOT MORE THAN PEOPLE THINK 
AND I THINK THAT COMES ACROSS WHEN I PLAY THE CLARINET 
ANY IDEA WHERE YOU ARE ARE YOU JOKING I'VE GOT A BLINDFOLD ON 
I CAN'T SEE WHERE I'M GOING 
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY TODAY AND I TURNED NINETEEN 
AT ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK THIS MORNING 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU 
AT NINETEEN ANKE IS NOW THE OLDEST OF THE FINALISTS 
AND HER AGE MEANS THIS IS HER LAST SHOT AT BEING YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
I'M TOO OLD TO GO FOR IT ANOTHER TIME SO THIS IS IT BASICALLY 
I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT WITH HER OXFORD DEGREE AS WELL COS WE'RE STRESSED OUT ENOUGH AS IT IS 
IT'S SCARY THEY'RE ALL SO YOUNG IT IS SCARY YEAH THE PRESSURE MUST BE INTENSE 
SHE'S DONE US ALL REALLY PROUD 
I THINK HER CHANCES ARE PRETTY HIGH 
SHE FOCUSES ON WHAT HAS TO BE DONE THAT'S THE WAY TO GET THROUGH OXFORD AND YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR 
SHE JUGGLES BOTH WELL AT THE MOMENT AND THERE'S NO REASON WHY SHE CAN'T DO BOTH LATER ON SO HOPEFULLY 
SHE'LL STAY WITH US IF SHE WINS 
WHEN WE HEARD HER IN THE CHAPEL WE WERE STUNNED 
VERY GOOD ON YOU YOU'RE GOING TO EMBARRASS ME 
YOU'RE A BIT I THINK SHE'S A BIT TOO MODEST 
I'M NOT BEING MODEST I'M JUST SAYING 
THAT THE CHANCES OF ME BEATING THREE MUSIC SCHOOL KIDS NO 
WHO ARE PRACTISING THREE HOURS A DAY NO LOOK AT YOU 
THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT YOU 
OH AND I'M NOT BEING BIASED 
AH YEAH YOU ARE I'M NOT BIASED BUT I DON'T MIND YOU BEING BIASED 
PREPARED FOR THE CATEGORY FINAL 
HOPE ALL IS GOOD AND YOU'RE NOT PRACTISING TOO HARD WINK LOTS OF LOVE MEL 
IF JOE WON I'D BE SO HAPPY FOR HIM YEAH 
HE REALLY DESERVES IT HE WORKS REALLY HARD 
I'LL WRITE ON MEL'S WALL AS WELL TO LET HER KNOW I'M HOPEFULLY GETTING MY DRESS TOMORROW 
I DON'T KNOW 
I MEAN I'M QUITE COMPETITIVE 
BUT I GET ON WITH THE OTHER THREE SO WELL 
THAT I DON'T WANT TO LOSE ANY FRIENDS OVER IT 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT SHE'S GOING TO WEAR AND GIVE HER A WEE KISS 
WHAT A SPECIAL BOY I AM 
HEY ANKE HOW ARE YOU 
DID YOU GET A GREEN DRESS I BET YOU LOOK STUNNING 
I GOT A PINK ONE COULD NEVER MISS OUT ON A PINK DRESS 
IT'S REALLY NICE 
AND IT FITS REALLY WELL 
UM I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT WEARING IT 
WITH THE GIRLS' DRESSES ORGANISED IT'S THE PERFECT EXCUSE FOR DAVID TO GO SHOPPING 
YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT TO DRESS THE PART 
YOU'RE ON STAGE PERFORMING AND YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK LIKE A PERFORMER 
AND REALLY IMPRESS AND LOOK GOOD 
WHAT IS IT DRACULA 
DAVID'S TAKEN ALONG HIS FRIEND TABEA AS FASHION ADVISER 
SHOULD I WEAR A WAISTCOAT COULD BE COOL 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE JUDGES WOULD LIKE WELL SMART OBVIOUSLY 
DO YOU THINK THEY'D LIKE SOMETHING THAT STOOD OUT 
DO YOU MEAN COLOUR NOT A COLOUR BUT SOMETHING TOTALLY WITHIN WHAT I SHOULD BE WEARING 
BUT JUST SOMETHING THAT STANDS OUT A BIT QUIRKY O. K. 
BECAUSE I'M A BIT QUIRKY 
QUIRKY YEAH THAT'S COOL HELLO 
THANK YOU CHEERS 
FINALLY 
O. K. THERE'S A WAISTCOAT THERE 
THAT IS A HOT BELT 
OH IT'S PAUL SMITH THAT IS NICE

YOU'VE GOT SOME OF THESE HAVEN'T YOU 
OH WILD WELL IF I WANT TO LOOK FUNKY AND STAND OUT A BIT 
WE SHOULD TRY THESE SHOULDN'T WE I DARE YOU TO WEAR THEM 
WHAT DO YOU THINK FUNKY 
IS THIS A GOOD COMBINATION FOR A YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR PLEASE GO AND CHANGE 
JUDGES LOOK AT ME I'M STRIPY AND I'M MULTICOLOURED MAYBE NOT 
THE SHOES ARE COOL BUT NOT WITH THE SHIRT OFF YOU GO 
DOES IT LOOK GOOD WITH THE FLUTE SIZZLING HOT WE NEED NEW HAIR DON'T WE 
BETTER GO CHANGE BYE BYE THAT'S REALLY GOOD BYE 
AS THE FINAL APPROACHES 
MEL INTENSIFIES HER TOUGH REGIME OF PRACTICE AND LESSONS 
EVEN IF YOU'VE PERFECTED A PIECE YOU'VE STILL GOT TO KEEP PRACTISING IT 
AS SOON AS YOU DON'T PRACTISE FOR A DAY OR TWO THE STANDARD GOES DOWN YOU HAVE TO KEEP GOING WITH IT 
DO YOU WANT TO JUST TRY IT FROM THE TOP JUST LAZIER JUST ALL LAZIER 
GREAT 
IT'S NOT FOR EVERY STUDENT THE CAMERAS 
AND THE PRESSURE BUT WHENEVER MEL GETS UP IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE 
SHE GETS VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT 
AND THEN WHEN SHE'S ON STAGE IT'S LIKE SHE REALLY CAN JUST LET SOMETHING GO 
AND REALLY COMMUNICATE WITH HER AUDIENCE 
I THINK THAT'S A REAL GIFT 
BACK AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF MUSIC 
ORCHESTRA PRACTICE ISN'T GOING QUITE AS WELL AS MEL WOULD LIKE 
A LAST MINUTE CHANGE TO THE PIECE THEY'RE PLAYING MEANS 
SHE'S NOT READY FOR HER SOLO 
I'M JUST REALLY ANNOYED THEY DIDN'T DO SCHEHERAZADE 
BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH A NICE OBOE SOLO AND IT'S LIKE I NOW HAVE TO PLAY SOME RAVEL PIECE OH WELL 
WHICH IS REALLY NOT VERY NICE O. K. 
I'M ANNOYED WE HAD TO DO THAT SOLO IN THE RAVEL WHICH IS NOT A NICE SOLO 
WITH DAYS TO GO BEFORE THE CATEGORY FINALS 
THE FRUSTRATIONS ARE BEGINNING TO SHOW 
HELLO HI 
ON WEDNESDAY I SORT OF FORCEFULLY PUT MY OBOE DOWN AND BENT THE FEATHER KEYS 
SOMEONE BENT THEM BACK BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE O. K. THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM 
I WAS VERY ANGRY 
BAD REHEARSAL 
I WAS QUITE ANNOYED AND JUST PUT IT DOWN AND DIDN'T REALISE WHAT I'D DONE UNTIL I TRIED PLAYING IT AGAIN 
THESE THINGS HAPPEN 
IT HAS TO BE AIRTIGHT FOR THE INSTRUMENT TO WORK PROPERLY 
SO WE USE THE THINNEST CIGARETTE PAPERS WE CAN FIND AND DRAG TEST 
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FINE 
O. K. THANK YOU YOU'RE VERY WELCOME 
AND GOOD LUCK THANK YOU 
IT'S THE DAY OF THE CATEGORY FINALS 
AND OUR FOUR FRIENDS BEGIN TO ARRIVE 
ALL OF THEM KNOWING THAT AT THE END OF TONIGHT'S CONCERT 
THERE WILL ONLY BE ONE WINNER 
THIS IS THE FUN PART 
THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WORKING TOWARDS 
AFTER WEEKS APART 
IT'S QUITE A REUNION FOR THEM ALL 
HELLO ALL RIGHT HOW ARE YOU

HOW'S YOUR TERM BEEN HAS IT BEEN AS STRESSFUL AS YOU IMAGINED M. M. M. 
HELLO HEY YOU O. K. I'M GOOD

THERE'S NO TENSION 
BUT COME ON EVERYONE KNOWS THAT WE ALL WANT TO GET THROUGH MORE THAN THE OTHER ONE 
I WANT TO GO THROUGH OVER SOMEONE ELSE OF COURSE I DO 
THIS IS EXCITING 
I'M SO DETERMINED TO GET THROUGH JUST THE FACT THAT I MIGHT GET 
THAT AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY WITH AN ORCHESTRA IS JUST FANTASTIC 
PRACTICE IT'S GOTTA HAPPEN I'M SORRY IT REALLY HAS TO NOW 
OTHERWISE NO 
EACH ONE KNOWS THAT TO GET THROUGH TONIGHT THEY'LL HAVE TO GIVE THE BEST PERFORMANCE OF THEIR LIVES 
THE TITLE IS WITHIN SIGHT SO I MEAN I'M GONNA GO FOR IT 
AND I'M GONNA TRY MY VERY VERY BEST 
BUT I'M NOT EXPECTING TO GO ANY FURTHER AND I'VE ALREADY PROMISED MY TUTORS THAT I WON'T 
SO I'M QUITE HAPPY TO JUST GO AND PLAY 
READY WHOO 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO EASY TO JUST GET 
SO FRUSTRATED AND SO BURNED OUT AND END UP JUST HATING THE PIECES 
BUT I LOVE PLAYING THE CLARINET 
AND SHOWING PEOPLE HOW MUCH I LOVE PLAYING THE CLARINET 
THEY BRING GOOD LUCK 
HE'S STILL GETTING DRESSED NO

THEY'LL EACH HAVE JUST FIFTEEN MINUTES ON STAGE TO PERSUADE THE JUDGES 
THAT THEY SHOULD BE THE ONE CHOSEN TONIGHT 
ZERO POINT TWO ZERO COMPETITORS OUT OF A STARTING FIELD 
AND THAT JUDGING PANEL CONSISTS OF CLARINET SOLOIST AND CONDUCTOR EMMA JOHNSON 
RENOWNED FLAUTIST ANDREW NICHOLSON 
AND BEN FOSTER COMPOSER CONDUCTOR AND CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDGES 
FIRST COMPETITOR TONIGHT JOSEPH SHINER 
THE DEBUSSY THE PREMIERE RHAPSODIE 
MY TEACHER SAID YOU CAN WOW THEM WITH THE FIRST THREE NOTES 
I THINK O. K. NO PRESSURE 
I THOUGHT HE HAD A LOVELY OPEN STAGE PRESENCE 
I SUPPOSE MY ONLY RESERVATION 
IS IN THE DEBUSSY TO REALLY BRING IT OFF 
YOU NEED TO HAVE A WIDER DYNAMIC RANGE 
I DIDN'T QUITE FEEL HE HAD THAT 
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT PIECE FOR BREATHING ISN'T IT 
IT IS AND I JUST FELT SOMETIMES 
HE STRUGGLED A BIT WITH THE LENGTH OF PHRASES 
HOWEVER THE HOROVITZ FANTASTIC YOU REALLY FELT THAT STYLE 
IT WAS REALLY GOOD FUN HE REALLY BROUGHT THAT OFF 
HE HAD AN INCREDIBLE SENSE OF GROOVE AND TIMING 
AND FEEL FOR THAT SECOND PIECE THAT WAS EXCELLENT YES 
HE OBVIOUSLY HAS A HUGE FAN CLUB WITH HIM TONIGHT I THINK SO YES THE WHOLE AUDIENCE WARMED TO THAT 
YES THERE WAS A REAL ENTHUSIASM 
YOU GOT PLENTY OF CHEERS I WAS I'M GONNA GET MORE THAN YOU 
IT WAS O. K. 
IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
IT'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT PERFORMANCE THAT CHANGES ME COMPLETELY 
I THINK I'M A DIFFERENT PERSON WHEN I'M ON STAGE 
THE SCHUMANN IT WAS SO EMOTIONALLY CHARGED 
IT WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL TO LISTEN TO AND YOU COULD TELL 
THAT SHE WAS VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THE MUSIC 
SO FOR ME THAT WAS MY FAVOURITE PIECE OF THE WHOLE EVENING 
THE TELEMANN 
IS NOT NORMALLY PLAYED ON THE OBOE NO 
SHE'S DECIDED SHE'S GOING TO ADOPT IT FOR THE OBOE I WAS REALLY PLEASED 
THAT SHE CHOSE THAT BECAUSE IT SUITED HER 
AND I THOUGHT JAZZ OBOE WOULD BE SOMETHING I'D NEVER WANT TO HEAR BUT I'D LIKE TO HEAR IT AGAIN 
BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY GOOD IT WAS SURREAL BUT AMAZING 
IT WAS A GOOD SHOW 
THERE WERE FIREWORKS TOWARDS THE END BUT THERE WERE MOMENTS OF CONCENTRATION AND REAL EMOTION 
BIG ISN'T IT IT'S REALLY BIG 
SCARY 
YAY 
THERE ARE BOTTLES DOWN THERE 
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT ME AND THAT CAN'T CHANGE 
OH DEAR I JUST HOPE IT WAS A GOOD THING 
I THINK IT'S AMAZING I MEAN GREAT FINGERS GREAT SOUND 
I THINK THAT JOLIVET IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE HARDEST PIECES 
HE HAD A SLIGHT PROBLEM THE WAY THAT THE SOUND WAS MM HMM 
LOOKING AT THE MUSIC TOO MUCH IT WAS A SHAME THAT HE USED MUSIC 
HE WAS A BIT INDIFFERENT BECAUSE HE WAS SLIGHTLY TO THE SIDE 
WHEN HE TURNED TO THE AUDIENCE AND PLAYED HIS LAST PIECE THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE 
I WAS EXCITED TO HEAR THIS PIECE ZOOM TUBE 
COS I KNOW IT'S A GREAT THEATRICAL PIECE 
IT COULD EASILY SOUND RIDICULOUS IF YOU DIDN'T GET THAT ATTITUDE 
YOW 
I FELT I WAS IN REALLY SAFE HANDS WITH HIM AND I DIDN'T WORRY 
IF THERE WERE GOING TO BE BREATHING PROBLEMS OR ANY TECHNICAL PROBLEMS 
JUST CONCENTRATE ON THE MUSIC WHICH IS WHAT YOU WANT 
A LITTLE BIT SHAKY WHICH I'M NOT USED TO 
USUALLY I'M SHAKY AFTERWARDS 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT GLASS OF WINE 
THANK YOU 
THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN 
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I CAME OUT WITH A SMILE ON MY FACE THAT WAS SUCH A BLAST 
THE ABIME DES OISEAUX BY MESSIAEN IS MEANT TO STOP TIME 
IT'S JUST DESOLATE REALLY 
I JUST HOPE I CAN PULL IT OFF 
DID SHE PULL THE MESSIAEN OFF EMOTIONALLY IT WASN'T QUITE THERE 
I NEEDED TO FEEL A LITTLE MORE OF THAT DESOLATION AND DESPERATION 
HER FACE AT THE END DIDN'T SAY DESOLATE IT JUST SAID WHAT'S NEXT REALLY 
WHEN SHE STARTED THE WEBER IT WAS A RELEASE 
AND FOR ME THE SOUND SHE MADE IN THAT PIECE WAS FIRST CLASS 
VERY FLUENT 
VERY QUICK FINGERWORK AND SHE WAS REALLY ON TOP OF IT 
THE BREATHING WASN'T QUITE EFFORTLESS ENOUGH 
SOMETIMES YOU WERE VERY AWARE OF HER NEEDING TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH 
I GOT TO THE END AND I WAS JUST LIKE PBBBBTT PBBT 
BUT YEAH IT SHOULD BE FINE HOPEFULLY 
WHILE THE JUDGES RETIRE FOR THE UNENVIABLE TASK OF CHOOSING A WINNER 
FOR OUR FOUR FINALISTS AT LEAST THE PERFORMANCES ARE OVER

ANDREW FOR ME YEAH REALLY I'M TORN AT THE MOMENT 
BETWEEN BETWEEN A COUPLE OF THEM 
OH MY GOODNESS THEY'RE TAKING A WHILE AND I'M IMPATIENT 
ANDREW IS THERE A NAME THAT YOU HAVE ON THE TIP OF YOUR TONGUE 
I'M TOO HYPED UP 
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW I'D RATHER JUST GO LA LA LA LA LA 
I THOUGHT THE RISK TAKING WAS FABULOUS AND SHE WAS COMMITTED
