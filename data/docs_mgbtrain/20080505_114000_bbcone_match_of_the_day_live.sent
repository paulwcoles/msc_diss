FORM TEAM BUT IT HAS NOT GONE 
THEIR WAY THIS SEASON AS WE PROVED 
IN THE LEAGUE CUP FINAL THEIR THEIR POTENCY UP FRONT FOUR GOALS AN 
AVERAGE IN EVERY SINGLE GAME IN THE 
LEAD SO FAR OTHER THAN HAVING UN 
GOAL HOW TO STOP THEM SCORING 
THEY ARE GOING TO BE VIA A VERY 
TOUGH FORCED UP FRONT KELLY SMITH 
RACHEL FRANKIE JULIE FLEETING ALL 
OF PEOPLE CAN SCORE GOALS FOR THEM 
TELFORD IN GOAL FOR LEEDS WILL HAVE 
A TOUGH GAME SHE WILL BE THE 
BUSIER OF THE TWO KEEPER'S SHE 
WILL BE SOMEONE WHO COULD GIVE 
THOSE GOALS AT BAY 
A BIG DAY FOR 
CARLY CAN SHE RISE TO THIS 
OCCASION 
SHE IS VERY CONFIDENT OCCASION TECHNICALLY VERY GOOD I AM SURE 
SHE WILL BE UP FOR THE OCCASION 
GAVIN YOU WATCHED LEEDS DE MOSS FIVE 
ZERO A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO BY ARSENAL 
WHY WILL IT BE DIFFERENT TODAY 
HOPEFULLY THEY WILL HAVE LEARNED 
FROM THAT EXPERIENCE THEY MUST NOT 
CONCEDE AN EARLY GOAL LIKE THEY 
DID IN THAT FINAL ARSENAL HAVE 
SCORED TWENTY NINE GOALS ON AWAITED THIS 
FINAL LEEDS HAVE GOT HERE BUT HAVE 
ONLY CONCEDED THREE DEFENSIVELY 
THEY HAVE BEEN PRETTY SOUND AND 
THEY HAVE TO CONTINUE THAT TODAY 
SET UP VERY NICELY INDEED IF YOU 
ARE SURPRISED THERE IS NO SUE SMITH 
SHE IS CONCENTRATING ON HER FIRST 
LOVER AND LINING UP FOR LEEDS IN 
THE SECOND THAT A CUP FINAL WE 
WILL HEAR FROM HER IN A MOMENT BUT 
CARRIE DAVIS HAS BEEN TALKING WITH 
THE ARSENAL GOAL MACHINE LIANNE 
SANDERSON SANDERSON FROM THE MOMENT SHE COULD KICK 
BALL THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING 
LIANNE SANDERSON WANTED TO DO AND 
SHE LEARNT HER TRADE RIGHT OUTSIDE 
HER FRONT DOOR 
MY ABILITY HAS COME 
MOSTLY FROM PLAYING RAUL STREET 
FOOTBALL AND I USED TO PLAY 
PEOPLE WILL KNOW ME FROM PLAYING ON 
THE ROAD WITH ALL THE KIDS L. WAS 
PLAYING UP UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO 
WHEN I STARTED PLAYING IN THE FIRST 
TEAM BECAUSE AS A YOUNGSTER YOU 
PLAY ANYWHERE L. STARTED PLAYING 
FOR A BOYS' TEAM WHEN I WAS NINE L. 
HAD GROWN UP WITH THEM BUT I LOOK 
BACK ON IT AND IT WAS A GOOD THING 
AND I JOINED ARSENAL WHEN I WAS 
NINE ARSENAL HAVE MADE ME THE 
PLAYER THAT I AM TODAY 
LIANNE HAS 
ENJOYED CUP FINAL SUCCESS AGAINST 
LEEDS BEFORE THE FIVE TO ZERO HAMMERING 
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX 
THEY HAVE MORE 
EXPERIENCE THAN THEY DID BEFORE 
THAT WAS THEIR FIRST F. A. CUP FINAL 
THIS IS GOING TO BE THEIR SECOND 
AND IT IS GOOD EXPERIENCE FOR YOUNG 
PLAYERS TO GET TO THEIR SECOND 
FINAL 
BECAUSE YOU ARE WINNING ALL FINAL THAT TIME DO YOU FEEL THEY DID I I WOULD NOT SAY WE HATED BUT WE ARE 
THE BEST AND WE HAVE PROVED THAT 
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT IS 
NOT ABOUT BEING COMPLACENT BUT 
STATING THE OBVIOUS IF WE WIN THE 
DOUBLE THAT IS A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT 
BUT BECAUSE WE WON FOUR LAST YEAR 
THIS YEAR IS SEEN AS A FAILURE YOU YOU HAVE A SAY IN THE MUSIC THAT GOES 
ON IN THE DRESSING ROOM YEAH YEAH SOMETIMES WE HAVE MASTER OF THE 
TIME WE HAVE MUSIC AND ME OR ALEX 
WILL SORT THAT OUT L. WAS STITCHED 
UP AND IN A PROGRAMME I WAS MUSIC 
AND ENTERTAINMENTS MANAGER L. GET 
ASKED EVERY TIME WHAT DOES THAT 
INVOLVE I JUST LIKE MUSIC MUSIC 
CAN GET YOU BUZZING FOR A GAME L. 
KNOW THE GOALS LISTEN TO WHAT 
BEFORE THE GAME IT IS PART OF THE 
PREPARATION 
WHAT IS GOING ON IN PREPARATION THE DRESSING ROOM BEFORE WE RUN 
OUT 
R. AND AMP B. ANY TYPE 
OF MUSIC A LOT OUT OF THE GOALS OF OLDER THAN ME AND 
THEY ARE QUITE OLD AND THE WAY THEY 
THINK THEY WILL KILL ME FOR SAYING 
THAT BUT THEY LIKE OLD MUSIC 
DAY'S LATE ME FOR MY MUSIC THEY 
SAY TURN IT OFF L. PUT JUSTIN TURN 
BY GONE TO WIND THEM UP TURN IT 
OFF 
THE NERVES MAY NOT BE A OFF PROBLEM NOW 
NO MATTER HOW MANY CUP 
FINALS YOU PLAY IN YOU ARE ALWAYS 
NERVOUS YOU'RE ALWAYS NERVOUS BUT 
IN A GOOD WAY L. MEAN NERVES CAN 
BE A GOOD THING AND IT SHOWS IT 
REALLY DOES MATTER TO YOU AS SOON 
AS THE WHISTLE GOES AND THE GAME 
STARTS YOUR NERVES GO AND AT THE 
END OF THE DAY IT IS ELEVEN AGAINST ELEVEN 
YOU HAVE GOT TO DO WHAT YOU HAVE 
GOT TO DO 
YOU RARELY SEE SUE SMITH 
WITHOUT A SMILE ON HER FACE SADLY 
RECALLING THEIR LAST CUP FINAL 
AGAINST ARSENAL IS NO LAUGHING 
MATTER 
IT WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTING MATTER WE WERE HAPPY TO BE THERE TWO YEARS 
AGO WE GOT TO THE FINAL AND WE DID 
NOT EXPECT TO GET THERE SO A LOT 
OF PLAYERS FROZE IT WAS A BIT 
NERVE RACKING PLAYING IN FRONT OF 
TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT WAS PRETTY 
DIFFICULT FOR SOME OF THE YOUNG 
PLAYERS AND FOR MYSELF IT IS HARD 
AND NERVE RACKING HOPEFULLY WE 
HAVE LEARNED FROM THAT L. L. HOPE IT 
IS NOT FIVE TO ZERO AGAIN 
EN ROUTE TO THE 
FINAL LEEDS MADE GOING THROUGH ON 
PENALTIES SOMETHING OF A SPECIALITY 
SMITH SCORED THE WINNING KICK TRIES 
I ACTUALLY HOPE IT GOES TO 
PENALTIES I'D DONE THAT WILL 
BECAUSE THAT IS NERVE RACKING BUT 
WE PLAYED CHELSEA BRISTOL AND 
EVERTON AND WE WON ALL OF THOSE ON 
PENALTIES WE HAVE NOT PRACTISE 
THEM SO I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY 
CAME FROM CARLY TELFORD IS THE 
ENGLAND KEEPER SO WE HAVE GOT 
CONFIDENCE IN HER WE HAVE BEEN 
PRETTY GOOD AT PENALTIES 
SUE HAS 
BECOME A REGULAR ON THE PUNDITS' 
COUCH TOO BUT SHE WILL NOT GIVE 
UP HER DAY JOB JUST YET 
IT IS 
SOMETHING I WOULD LOVE TO GET INTO 
AFTER FOOTBALL BUT MY FIRST LOVE 
IS FOOTBALL AND I WAS REALLY 
JEALOUS OF ALL THE GOALS LAST TIME 
WHEN I WAS DOING THE F. A. CUP FINAL 
I JUST WANTED TO BE PLAYING IT IS 
GREAT THAT WE HAVE GOT THERE BUT I 
WILL MISS GAVIN AND DOING THE 
PUNDITRY STUFF BUT IT IS GREAT TO 
BE PLAYING 
LAST SEASON ARSENAL 
WERE INVINCIBLE THIS TIME THOUGH 
THEY HAVE NOT HAD IT ALL THEIR OWN 
WAY WITH THE LEAGUE CUP GOING TO 
EVERTON GIVING THESE MACRO A 
GLIMMER OF HOPE 
I SPOKE TO THE 
EVERTON GIRLS AFTER THE GAME 
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE TRICKS L. 
THINK THEY ALL BELIEVE IN 
THEMSELVES THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE 
AND THOUGHT THEY COULD GO OUT AND 
WIN WHICH A LOT OF TEAMS BECAUSE 
ARSENAL ARE SO GREAT AND HAVE BEEN 
FOR TEN YEARS YOU ARE PROBABLY 
NERVOUS WHEN YOU GO YOU ARE BEATEN 
BEFORE YOU KICK A BALL WE HAVE TO 
BELIEVE IN OURSELVES AND WE HAVE 
TO NOT FREEZE AND DEFINITELY NOT 
CONCEDE AN EARLY GOAL THAT IS THE 
MAIN THING HOLD THEM AND HOPEFULLY 
PUSH ON 
THESE ARE THE ELEVEN LADIES 
WHO THE MANAGER BELIEVES CAN DO THE 
BUSINESS TODAY SOME WOULD REFER TO THESE AS THE 
ENGLAND YOUTH TEAM 
THEY HAVE GOT 
HERE AND LEGS ARE THERE AND THEY 
WILL BE UP AND DOWN THE PITCH THE 
TWO WIDE PLAYERS SMITH AND CLARKE 
WILL HAVE TO GET BACK INTO THE 
MIDFIELD AREA TO BLOCK IT UP 
OTHERWISE ARSENAL WILL RUN RIOT 
THAT IS THE KEY AMANDA BARR FRONT 
IS ALSO CRUCIAL FOR THEM BECAUSE 
SHE IS GOING TO HOLD UP THE PLAY 
TRY AND GET FORWARD AND SCORE A 
GOAL SHE WILL BE THREAD FOR THEM 
EXPERIENCED INTERNATIONALS IN THE 
ARSENAL STARTING LINE UP THAT IS 
PRETTY DAUNTING LOOKING LINE UP 
WHEN YOU START WITH THIS TEAM YOU 
LOOK AT THE FRONT FOUR KELLY SMITH 
FROM BEHIND SANDERSON AND CANNY 
AND YANKEY OUT WIDE THE OTHER 
THING IS LUDLOW ONE OF THE BEST 
BOX TO BOX PLAYERS IN THE COUNTRY 
JULIE FLEETING ON THE BENCH HAS 
BEEN OUT WITH AN INJURY AND WHAT A 
GOAL SCORER SHE HAS HOW TO STOP 
THEM THEY WILL ALL BE ABOUT 
IMPOSING THEIR GAME ON LEEDS 
LIANNE SANDERSON ON A ROME PLAYING 
UP FRONT SHE WILL BE WANTING TO 
PUT IN A BIG GAME PERFORMANCE THAT 
IS NOT WHAT SHE HAS BEEN ABLE TO 
DELIVER 
SHE IS STILL A YOUNG GOW DELIVER BUT I'M SURE SHE WILL WANT TO GET 
ON THE SCORESHEET SHE WILL WANT TO 
PUT IN A GOOD PERFORMANCE FOR THE 
TEAM 
SUE MENTION THAT THEY HAVE TEAM BEEN ON THE PHONE TO YOU FINDING 
OUT WHAT YOU DID RIGHT AGAINST 
ARSENAL WOULD YOU FIND BELIEF WE WE CARRIED MOMENTUM FROM THE WHOLE 
SEASON INTO THAT GAME EVERYTHING 
WAS ALWAYS POSITIVE IN THE CHANGING 
ROOM WE HAD GATHERED SOME KIND OF 
FORM WE WENT INTO THAT GAME WITH 
THE MOST BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE EVER 
HAD AND THAT WAS WHAT GOT US 
THROUGH THAT GAME AND GOT AS THE 
WIN 
LINING UP FOR HER SECOND CUP WIN FINAL SO ISN'T IT IS ONLY THINKING 
OF YOU 
SHE IS A NATURAL IN FRONT 
OF THE CAMERA THERE IS A CAREER 
FOR THE THERE BUT THIS IS HER 
FIRST LOVE AND WHAT SHE IS PURSUING 
I AM PLEASED FOR THAT SHE HAS GOT 
ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM AND NEEDS TO 
LEAD BY EXAMPLE TODAY 
WILL LEEDS 
BE USING THE PREVIOUS DEFEAT AS 
MOTIVATION TODAY OR WILL THE BOSS 
HAVE TRIED TO BANISH THAT FROM 
THEIR MEMORIES 
YOU TRY TO BANISH 
IT BUT YOU HAVE TO LEARN FROM THAT 
FROM THE PAST L. THINK THAT THEY 
WILL HAVE DONE THAT YOU ARE 
PLAYING A SIDE THAT IS VERY GOOD 
VERY ACCOMPLISHED VERY EXPERIENCED 
LOT OF FIREPOWER YOU MUST NOT 
THERE THEN GET THEIR NOSES IN FRONT 
TOO EARLY 
NO BONES ABOUT THIS IT 
IS NOT GOING THE BE EASY FOR LEEDS 
TODAY ARSENAL THE TEAM THEY WERE 
LAST SEASON THEY ONLY GOING FOR 
THE DOUBLE 
THE DIFFERENCE FROM 
LAST YEAR IS THAT THEIR BELIEF 
THEY TEAM BONDING IS NOT WHAT IT 
USED TO BE L. THINK MAYBE THAT HAS 
BEEN THEIR UNDOING THIS SEASON 
WILL IT BE ENOUGH GIVE US YOUR 
SCORE FOR TODAY 
AND ARSENAL WIN 
NOT TOO MUCH OF AN UNDERLING 
I SAY 
THE SAME 
ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE 
THIS A CLEAN SWEEP 
LEEDS' BEST 
HOPE IS TO TAKE IT TO EXTRA TIME 
AND PENALTIES 
AS FAR AS I'M 
CONCERNED NO COMMENT LUCY WARD 
MAYBE OUT WITH A KNEE INJURY BUT 
SHE WILL BE WILLING ON HER TEAM 
MATES FROM THE COMMENTARY BOX

ROUTE TO THE FINAL ONLY FACING ONE 
PREMIER LEAGUE TEAM BIRMINGHAM IN 
THE QUARTER FINALS THEY WON THAT

WEST HAM AND LINCOLN CITY OUT COME THE TEAMS FOR THE THIRTIETH F. A. WOMEN'S CUP FINAL ARSENAL ARE THE RECORD HOLDERS

NEXT WEEK FOR AN IMPORTANT EURO 
TWO THOUSAND NINE QUALIFIER LET'S GET A WORD 
FROM LUCY YOU WERE WITH THE 
PLAYERS LAST NIGHT AND THIS MORNING 
TWO YEARS AGO WHEN YOU PLAYED IN 
THE FINAL IT WAS LEEDS'S FIRST 
APPEARANCE IN THE FINAL HOW IS IT 
THIS TIME 
I AM MORE NERVOUS THAN 
WHEN I PLAYED TWO YEARS AGO THE 
GIRLS ARE MORE PREPARED THIS TIME 
AND I THINK ARSENAL WILL NOT WALK 
IT LIKE THEY DID TWO YEARS AGO WE 
HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE EVEN 
THOUGH THE GIRLS ARE YOUNG THAT IS 
IMPORTANT COMING INTO THE CUP 
FINAL 
THE NERVES ARE SETTLED THEY FINAL MIGHT JUST JANGLE AGAIN WITH THE 
HEARING OF THE NATIONAL ANTHEM EVERYBODY LOOKS KEEP UP KEYED UP 
THE ARSENAL MANAGER SHOULD BE USED 
TO THIS SORT OF OCCASION HE IS 
LOOKING TO EVERY SUCCESS THAT IS 
POSSIBLE IN WOMEN'S FOOTBALL A 
FAMILIAR FIGURE ALONGSIDE ARSENE 
WENGER ON THE WOMEN'S THE ARSENAL 
BENCH THERE IS FAYE WHITE LEADING 
HER TEAM ALONG THE LINE THEY HAVE 
MET ONCE THIS SEASON THEY ARE YET 
TO PLAY IT IN THE LEAGUE IN THE 
LAST MEETING LEEDS WON BY PORTERS 
ZERO IN MARCH KELLY SMITH WAS HAILED BY HER 
MANAGER LAST QUICK AS THE BEST 
PLAYER CURRENTLY IN THE WORLD 
LAST WEEK JAYNE LUDLOW SCORED 
TWICE IN LAST YEAR'S FINAL FOUR 
TEENAGERS IN THE LEEDS LINE UP 
EMPHASISES THE DIFFERENCE IN BEEN 
THERE AND DONE IT TERMS THE 
YOUNGEST JAYNE MOORE IS ONLY SEVENTEEN LEEDS'S CUP FINAL DEFEAT TWO YEARS 
AGO TO ARSENAL IS THE ONLY TIME 
THEY HAVE GOT THIS FAR BEFORE VIC AKERS HAS BEEN A MEMBER OR A 
PART OF ARE SOLD FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS 
JOINED THE CLUB IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AS HEAD OF 
THE COMMUNITY DEPARTMENT PART OF 
ARSENAL SINCE THEN HE HAS LED THE 
TEAM TO WIN TWENTY EIGHT MAJOR TROPHIES LAST 
YEAR IT WAS THE QUADRUPLE 
INCLUDING THE WAY FOR A CUP FINAL 
IF THEY WIN TODAY JUST THE DOUBLE 
FOR THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW SUCH 
IS THEIR DOMINANCE FAYE WHITE HAS COME DOWN TO JOINT 
THE MATCH OFFICIALS JUST WRITE 
WILL JOIN HER NOW JESSICA WRIGHT 
THE REFEREE IS ORIGINALLY FROM 
SLOVAKIA AND NOW BASED IN 
SHROPSHIRE IT LOOKS AS THOUGH FAYE 
WHITE HAS WON THE TOSS SHE HAS 
MADE HER CHOICE THE ASSISTANT REFEREE THE REFEREE 
IS A REGULAR ASSISTANT REFEREE IN 
THE MEN'S FIXTURES THERE IS RICK 
PASSMOOR HEAD COACH OF LEEDS 
UNITED WHAT AN EXCELLENT FIRST 
SEASON IN CHARGE ONLY APPOINTED 
LAST SEASON HE HAS GUIDED HIS SIDE 
TO ONLY THEIR SECOND EVER F. A. CUP 
FINAL LEEDS UNITED ARE GOING TO GET THE 
ACTION UNDER WAY IN A BRAND 
SPANKING NEW F. A. CUP FINAL KICK 
KATE KENNET KENNET LEEDS UNITED'S FINISH OF THIRD 
BEHIND EVERTON AND THE GUNNERS HAS 
BEEN CONFIRMED IT WAS THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY THAT 
SUNDERLAND BEAT YOU'D BEAT LEEDS 
UNITED AT WEMBLEY FOR ARGUABLY THE 
GREATEST EVER ETHIC CUP FINAL MEN'S 
UPSET WERE LEEDS TO WIN TODAY IT 
WOULD BE THE BIGGEST EVER UPSET IN 
A WOMEN'S EPEE CUP FINAL F. A. CUP 
LUCY YOU WILL BE KEEPING A CLOSE 
WATCH ON WHO IS NERVOUS ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY BOTH TEAMS WILL BE NERVOUS ARSENAL 
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO WIN AND 
MAINTAIN THEIR DOMINANCE AND LEEDS 
BECAUSE FOR MOST OF THE GIRLS 
THIS IS THEIR FIRST EXPERIENCE 
THEY ARE YOUNG AND THEY DON'T HAVE 
THE FEAR OF LOSING THEY JUST WANT 
TO HAVE A GO AS WE KNOW FROM WATCHING ENGLAND MARY PHILLIP IS DECEPTIVELY PACY MARY PHILLIP SCORED HER FIRST TWO 
ARSENAL GOALS THIS SEASON BOTH IN 
THE RUN TO TODAY'S'S TODAY'S 
FINAL IN THE F. A. CUP THEY HAD AN ELEVEN TO ONE WIN AGAINST 
SOUTHERN DIVISION NEWQUAY THAT WAS 
A GOAL CELEBRATED MORE THAN ANY 
OTHER THIS SEASON FOR ARSENAL RACHEL YANKEY LOOKS LIKE SHE HAS 
BEEN STRUGGLING WITH AN INJURY SHE 
HAS STRAPPING ROUND HER KNEE L. 
DON'T KNOW HOW SERIOUS THAT IS SHE SHE DID MISS ARSENAL'S LAST GAME EIGHT 
DAYS AGO A FIVE TO ONE WIN AGAINST 
BLACKBURN ROVERS THEY HAVE GONE 
THROUGH THE ENTIRE SEASON UNBEATEN 
FOR THE FOURTH SEASON IN A ROW 
ARSENAL I WON'T SPEAK TOO SOON 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE LEEDS TO PLAY IT 
YET AT HOME 
THEY DREW AGAINST 
EVERTON AND EVERTON ARE CATCHING 
THEM UP CLEARED OFF 
THE LINE AND AWAY IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ARSENAL TO GET THE DOMINANCE EARLY ON AND FOUR 
LEEDS TO NOT CONCEDE A BIT OF 
NERVES OUT THERE BEFORE ARSENAL 
DASHBOARD LEEDS A HALF HEARTED APPEAL BUT SHE IS 
CONTINUING WITH HER APPEAL SHE SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A PENALTY L. THINK 
SHE GOT TO SHOUT FROM SOPHIE 
BRADLEY DID JESSICA SHE GOT A 
SCHELDT A SHOUT KAREN CARNEY THE LEAST EXPERIENCED 
OF THE ARSENAL SIDE SHE HAS ONLY 
ONE THIS THING ONCE LAST YEAR 
AGAINST CHARLTON ATHLETIC THEY WON 
FOUR TO ONE LAST YEAR THE GIRL WHO SCORED 
FOR CHARLTON KATIE HOLTHAM IS IN 
THE LEEDS LINE UP THIS YEAR IT WAS LUCKY FOR LEEDS THAT KAREN CARNEY DIDN'T GET HOLD OF THE BALL NOT SO WELL STRUCK FOR LUDLOW THAT TIME FOR A MIDFIELDER WHO SITS PRETTY 
DEEP SHE ALWAYS GETS HER FAIR 
SHARE OF GOALS ONLY LIANNE 
SANDERSON HAS SCORED MORE WHAT 
ARSENAL THIS SEASON 
JAYNE LUDLOW 
COMES ACROSS VERY QUICKLY SHE IS 
UP THERE ATTACKING AND SCORING THE 
GOALS 
NINETEEN THIS SEASON LIANNE GOALS SANDERSON HAS JUST GOT FIFTY SO FAR 
QUITE INCREDIBLE 
LIANNE SANDERSON 
IS AN INCREDIBLE FINISHER SHE 
PLAYS IN A TEAM FULL OF QUALITY 
PLAYERS WHO GIVE HER THE 
OPPORTUNITIES AND SHE PUTS THEM 
AWAY 
TWO GOALS AT LEAST IN EVERY AWAY ROUND THIS SEASON SHE GOT FOUR IN 
THE FOURTH ROUND AGAINST NEWQUAY YOU CAN'T GIVE KELLY SMITH THAT 
MUCH SPACE IN THE BOX THE BALL 
CAME TO HER SHE HAD A COUPLE OF 
YARDS THE GIRLS DID WELL TO GET IN 
FRONT CARLY TELFORD IS IN THE WAY 
CARLY TELFORD ENGLAND'S NUMBER THREE STEVE WHARTON USUALLY PLAYS IN THE 
MIDDLE OF MIDFIELD STEPH HORTON 
STEPH HOUGHTON A LITTLE NUDGE IN THE BACK OF SUE 
SMITH COURTESY OF RACHEL YANKEY 
BRINGS ABOUT A LEEDS FREE KICK AND 
AN END FOR THE MOMENT TOO THAT 
SPELL OF ARSENAL PRESSURE TWO TWO SIMILAR SIZED PLAYERS GOING FOR THE 
BALL AND NEITHER WANTED TO HEAD IT SUE SMITH IS VERY MUCH THE FACE OF 
LEEDS UNITED THAT MAKES YOU THE 
VOICE LUCY NO COMMENT OF THE CROSSBAR KELLY SMITH TRIED 
TO FOLLOW UP OFF THE CROSSBAR 
ARSENAL BATTERING AWAY AT THAT 
LEEDS UNITED DOOR GREAT STOP 
BY TELFORD AND CLEARED BY CULVIN 
IF LEEDS ARE GOING TO 
GET ANYTHING FROM THIS GAME CARLY 
TELFORD WILL HAVE TO BE ON TOP OF 
THE GAME WHAT A STRIKE THAT WAS SHE KNEW SHE WAS IN FOR A BUSY 
AFTERNOON THERE IS COMING TO BE 
LOTS MORE OF THE SAME I FEEL 
THERE IS GOING TO BE BE USEFUL CHALLENGE MADE BY SOPHIE 
SOPHIE BRADLEY 
IT IS IMPORTANT 
THAT LEEDS TRIED TO SOAK UP THIS 
PRESSURE I MAKE THAT THREE EXCELLENT SAVES ALREADY FROM CARLY TELFORD USUALLY WHEN YOU WATCH WOMEN'S 
FOOTBALL ARSENAL MATCHES 
GOALKEEPING ERRORS YOU TEND TO 
TALK ABOUT THE CLASS OF ARSENAL IT 
IS LUCKY THAT CARLY TELFORD HAS 
STARTED WELL 
SHE WENT TO THE WORLD 
CUP LAST TIME FOR EXPERIENCE AS THE 
NUMBER THREE NOWHERE NEAR CLOSE ENOUGH TO RACHEL YANKEY COME OUT FOR A LEEDS THROW LEEDS 
HAVE TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE LITTLE BIT OF BREATHER IF 
THEY CAN JUST GET HOLD OF IT AND 
PASS IT AROUND A LITTLE BIT BUT IT 
IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE AGAINST 
THIS FANTASTIC ARSENAL SIDE THE BALL NEVER WENT IN ARSENAL GET THE THROW RICK PASS 
MORE WHO HAS DECIDED TO SIT A 
LITTLE BIT HIGHER UP IN THE STAND 
FOR THE START OF THE GAME YOUR YOUR TWIN BROTHER GARY GOOD LOOKING GOOD LOOKING FELLA YOU SAID IT FREE KICK FOR ARSENAL SANDERSON WILL TAKE THE FREE KICK FAYE WHITE ATTACKS BUT COULD NOT 
QUITE GET A TOUCH TO IT THINK 
SHE WAS ONSIDE 
CARNEY WAS MORE 
CONFIDENT THAN I WOULD HAVE BEEN AS 
THAT BALL CAME ACROSS FAYE WHITE 
IS VERY GOOD AT SET PIECES KATIE HOLD THEM GETTING A HEAD 
START ON THE TWO ARSENAL PLAYERS 
NEAREST TO IT K. D. HOLTHAM TENACITY SHOWN BY SO THE BRADLEY 
FORCES THE AIR FROM CIARA GRAEME 
SHE WILL BE ONE FOR THE FUTURE 
FOUGHT AT THAT 
FROM THIS PART OF 
THE WORLD SHE STARTED AT 
NOTTINGHAM FOREST AND COMES FROM 
THIS CITY 
AN EXCELLENT PROSPECT 
THESE SIDES DID MEET IN A MAJOR 
FINAL LAST SEASON THE LEAGUE CUP 
FINAL AND IT WAS ONE TO ZERO FOR ARSENAL 
SO THE BRADLEY WAS PRETTY MUCH THE 
PLAYER OF THE MATCH THE SO THE 
BRADLEY 
SHE KEPT ARSENAL QUIET BRADLEY SHE HAD A VERY GOOD GAME IT IS AN ARSENAL CORNER ARSENAL GOT TO THE LEAGUE CUP FINAL 
AGAIN THIS SEASON BUT LOST WOULD 
YOU BELIEVE AGAINST EVERTON ONE TO ZERO 
AT THE END OF FEBRUARY THEIR ONLY 
DOMESTIC DEFEAT OF THE SEASON THEY 
DID RUN OF FIFTY EIGHT SUCCESSIVE WINS CARLY TELFORD HAS BUILT THAT ONE 
AND WAS INDEBTED TO ALEX CULVIN ON 
THE LINE WHO CLEARED KEEPERS KEEPERS USUALLY GET FREE KICKS FOR THOSE 
KIND OF THINGS EVEN IF IT IS NOT A 
FOUL BUT THE REFEREE LET PLAY STAY 
ON KATIE HOLTHAM LIKES TO BREAK 
MIDFIELD BUT COULD NOT GET THERE 
QUICKLY ENOUGH THIS TIME 
SHE TRIES 
TO PUT IT OVER THE TOP A CHALLENGE 
FROM LEANNE BUT THE REFEREE DID 
NOT GIVE IT CARLY LOOKED CONFIDENT 
ANYWAY 
SHE WILL BE DELIGHTED WITH ANYWAY THE WAY SHE HAS STARTED THE GAME 
LEEDS UNITED WILL BE GENERALLY 
KEEPING OUR STOCK AT BAY IN THE 
EARLY STAGES THAT IS THEIR FIRST 
MISSION KEEPING ARSENAL AT BAY CARNEY TRYING TO SLOT ONE IN TWO 
SANDERSON'S PATH A POOR CLEARANCE 
CARNEY FINDS YANKEY THIS TIME 
ASKED ARE NOT EXACTLY FLOODING THE 
BOX WITH RED AND WHITE SHIRTS 
ARSENAL LUDLOW GOES FOR GOAL WHAT A SAVE 
THAT IS THE BEST YET FROM CARLY 
TELFORD I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO 
BE ANOTHER LONG RANGE CRACKER FROM 
JAYNE LUDLOW BUT TELFORD STRETCHED 
A WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE SO FAR FROM 
THE LEEDS KEEPER 
LUDLOW NOTICE 
THAT CARLY WAS FURTHER FORWARD FROM 
HER LINE AND THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE 
A GO BUT SHE IS TALL AND HAS GOT A 
GOOD REACH EXCELLENT SAVE ANOTHER ARSENAL CORNER LEEDS 
UNITED JUST CANNOT GET THE BALL OUT 
OF THEIR OWN HALF OF THE FIELD TELFORD COULD NOT GET THROUGH THE 
CROWD BUT SHE DID GET ENOUGH ON IT 
THIS TIME THE WHISTLE HAS GONE FOR 
A FOUL ON THE KEEPER SHE LOOKS TO 
ME AS IF HE DOES NOT SHOW ANY SIGNS 
OF NERVES WHATSOEVER 
SHE IS A VERY 
GOOD KEEPER AND THESE YOUNG ONES 
NOWADAYS JUST DO NOT CARE THEY 
JUST GO OUT AND PLAY THAT IS WHAT 
MOST OF THE LEEDS TEAM ARE LIKE 
NOT LIKE ME THINKING IT MIGHT BE 
THEIR LAST GAME THEY JUST DON'T 
CARE A LOOK AT THE ARSENAL PLAYERS 
AND SEE THEM AS ORDINARY PEOPLE 
AND SO THEY SHOULD 
SHE IS ONE OF 
THE MAIN REASONS WHY LEEDS ARE IN 
THIS FINAL THEY GOT THROUGH FOUR 
ROUNDS THREE TIMES ON PENALTY 
SHOOT OUTS IN THE SEMI FINAL 
AGAINST EVERTON SHE EVEN SAVED ON 
FROM WILLIAMS IN THEIR SECOND 
MINUTE 
I WAS ON THE BENCH WITH MY MINUTE HEAD BETWEEN MY KNEES ARE THINKING 
OH DEAR BUT SHE DID WELL FARA 
JUST HAD AN OFF DAY SHE DOES NOT 
HAVE MANY OF THOSE ARSENAL ARE NOT THE SORT OFFSIDE TO 
LET FRUSTRATION GET THE BETTER OF 
THEM VIK AKERS DOES PLEAT PATIENCE 
UNLIKE THE REST OF US HE DOES NOT 
EXPECT TO WIN EVERY GAME TEN TO ZERO HE 
WILL BE QUITE HAPPY WITH THE WAY 
THEY ARE DOMINATING BUT BY THE 
SAME TOKEN RICK HAS MORE WILL BE 
PLEASED TO SEE THE CONFIDENCE 
LEVELS RISING WITH EVERY PASSING 
MINUTE 
WHEN YOU PLAY ARSENAL YOU MINUTE EXPECT NOT TO HAVE THE BALL AS MUCH 
AS THEM BUT IT IS THE GOALS THAT 
COUNT NOT POSSESSION IF LEEDS CAN 
KEEP POSSESSION IT IS GAME ON 
KELLY SMITH'S BALL BLOCKED BY 
CULVIN SHE THEN FOUND HERSELF IN 
RACE WITH AMANDA BARR JUST THREE 
YEARS AGO SHE WAS JUST ABOUT AN 
AUTOMATIC PICK FOR ENGLAND BUT 
THESE DAYS SHE CANNOT WORKER WAY 
INTO THE SQUAD DESPITE BEING THE 
LEEDS TOP SCORER 
A QUALITY SCORER 
SHE SCORED GOAL AFTER GOAL FOR 
ENGLAND IF SHE GETS A CHANCE TODAY 
I AM SURE SHE 
WILL PUT IT AWAY YOU YOU WILL HAVE TO EXPLAIN HER NICKNAME TO US SHE IS ON THE BALL NOW A LITTLE BIT HOPEFUL I THINK I 
WENT ON THE PITCH BEFORE THE GAME 
AND IT IS VERY HARD THERE IS NOT 
MUCH OF A BREEZE AND THAT WILL 
AFFECT THE GOALS AS THEY GO ALONG 
THE GIRLS 
BYRNE THE ARSENAL 
GOALKEEPER NOW ANITA ASANTE ALEX CULVIN MADE UP THE GROUND 
GOOD PLAY SHE KEPT UP WITH KAREN 
CARNEY AND MADE SURE IT WAS 
DIFFICULT FOR KAREN AND GOT THE 
BALL AWAY GOOD PRESSURE FROM KELLY SMITH 
SOPHIE WALTON MANAGED TO HOLD ON TO 
THE BALL AND TROY FOUL FROM THE 
ENGLAND STAR 
KELLY SMITH IS VERY 
CLEVER IN THE WAY THAT SHE DEFENCE 
AS WELL AS A TAX AND THE REFEREE 
SAW A BIT OF SHORT BOWLING I THINK 
SHOULD BOWLING 
ALEX CULVIN THE 
LEEDS LEFT BACK LOOKING TO 
CHALLENGE FOR AN ENGLAND PLACE THE FLAG HAS GONE UP AGAINST AMANDA 
BARR AS THE FREE KICK WAS TAKEN 
SHE SHOULD NOT BE OFFSIDE FOR THAT 
LENGTH OF FREE KICK 
I TOLD YOU IT 
WAS A WARM AFTERNOON RICK HAS GOT 
RID OF THE JACKET 
UNUSUAL TO SEE 
HIM IN A SUIT ACTUALLY AND VIC 
THEY USUALLY HAVE THEIR SHORTS ON ALL KAREN CARNEY COULD DO WAS 
FLITTED BACKWARDS IT MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN A GOOD IDEA IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN DIFFICULT TO SCORE FROM THERE 
GOOD PLAY BY JESS CLARKE SHE TRIED 
TO PUT HER IN BUT SHE WAS NOT 
HAVING ANY OF IT ALEX SCOTT HAS BEEN JUST ABOUT 
ARSENAL'S BIGGEST ATTACKING THREAT 
SO FAR 
SHE ALWAYS IS SHE IS 
TRADITIONALLY A FORWARD SHE PLAYS 
IN MOST POSITIONS A RIGHT BACK FOR 
ENGLAND BUT FOR ARSENAL SHOULD GET 
A LOT OF SPACE TO GO FOR IT AND 
ENDS UP SCORING GOALS 
SHE ALMOST 
PLAYS RIGHT WING AT RIGHT BACK AT 
THE SAME TIME SUCH IS HER SPEED 
ABSOLUTELY QUALITY PLAYER 
SHE WAS 
SIGNED FROM BIRMINGHAM THREE YEARS 
AGO PLENTY FROM LEEDS 
THAT IS ALL 
MY FAMILY JESS CLARKE A BIRTHDAY TO REMEMBER 
NINETEEN TODAY SHE BEATS JAYNE LUDLOW 
AGAIN YANKEY ANTICIPATED THAT WELL 
PURSUED BY SOPHIE WALTON THAT HAS 
BEEN GIVEN AS A FREE KICK TO 
ARSENAL A SOFT ON SHE COULD NOT GET PAST WALTON LEEDS COME AWAY WITH SUE SMITH SOPHIE WALTON STARTED WELL GUY 
THERE IS NOT ANY MIDFIELDERS TO GET 
THE BETTER OF HER SHE GAVE A FREE 
KICK A WAY THAT I AM NOT SURE ABOUT 
BUT SHE CAME AWAY WITH THE BALL SO 
GOOD PLAY 
WHAT A JOB AS THE SOLE 
HOLDING MIDFIELDER IN THE LEEDS 
SIDE SHE HAS GOT TO MARSHAL KELLY 
SMITH AS BEST SHE CAN SMITH IS 
SUCH A DIFFICULT PLAYER TO MARK 
SHE GETS SO DEEP 
SHE IS SUCH A 
CLEVER PLAYER THE MOVEMENT THAT 
SHE HAS WITHOUT THE BALL IS 
EXCEPTIONAL UNTIL YOU MARKER YOU 
DO NOT REALISE HOW GOOD SHE IS I I WONDER IF WE ARE GOING TO GET A 
CELEBRATION TO REMEMBER AGAIN TODAY EMMA BENN CAN AFFORD A TOUCH BEFORE 
CLEARING BACK TO FILL UP MR. 
BYRNE PHILLIP PLAYING IN HER SIX 
THE F. A. CUP FINAL THREE OF THOSE 
WERE WITH FULHAM CARNEY DID NOT MAKE THE BEST OF THAT STEPH FORTON YOU WOULD HAVE HER 
NAME A LOT MORE ON THE B. B. C. BUT FOR 
A BROKEN ANKLE A COUPLE OF DAYS 
BEFORE SHE WAS DUE TO GET OUT TO 
CHINA WITH THE ENGLAND SQUAD LAST 
SEPTEMBER THEIR PLACE WAS TAKEN BY 
EVERTON'S LINDSAY JOHNSON 
THAT IS 
THE ULTIMATE TWO DAYS BEFORE SHE 
WAS DUE TO FLY OUT IT WAS NOT A GREAT EFFORT BUT TWO 
MORE BRILLIANT SAVES FROM CARLY 
TELFORD 
I AM NOT SURE WHETHER THAT TELFORD WAS OFFSIDE NO IT WAS NOT GOOD 
SAVE EXCELLENT 
THE SECOND ONE WAS 
EVEN BETTER 
GOOD PLAY BY ALEX 
SCOTT KELLY EQUAL TO IT THE 
SECOND TIME AS OF GOOD GOALKEEPING 
A QUARTER OF THE GAME GONE I DO 
NOT THINK THERE IS ANY DOUBT ABOUT 
THE PLAYER OF THE MATCH SO FAR 
CARLY TELFORD ASIDE FROM 
SUNDERLAND LAST SUMMER SHE SAVED 
PENALTY AFTER PENALTY TO GET LEEDS 
TO THIS FINAL AND WHAT GAME SHE IS HAVING IT DRIFTS BEHIND KELLY SMITH DID 
HER LEVEL BEST TO MAKE SURE IT DID 
NOT 
AS THE GAME GOES ON TWENTY FIVE NOT MINUTES GONE LEEDS WILL START TO 
GROW IN CONFIDENCE A LITTLE BIRD 
LIKE I SAID BEFORE YOU EXPECT 
ARSENAL TO HAVE THE BALL BECAUSE 
THEY ARE SUCH GOOD PLAYERS THEY 
ARE VERY EXPERIENCED BUT IF THEY 
ARE NOT GOING TO BE INCISIVE 
PERHAPS 
THEY MONTAGE OF PERHAPS EVERYTHING CARLY TELFORD HAS DONE 
SO FAR SHE IS THE REASON WHY IT IS 
ZERO TO ZERO PREDOMINANTLY 
ABSOLUTELY SHE 
HAS DONE INCREDIBLY WELL UNDER 
PRESSURISED CONDITIONS SHE WILL GET A BUZZ FROM THE SAYS 
SHE HAS MADE HOPEFULLY THAT WILL 
GIVE HER CONFIDENCE THIS SAVES 
SHE 
HAS MADE YOU GET THE FEELING A BIT OF STING HAS BEEN DRAWN FROM ARSENAL 
ANYBODY WHO WATCHED THE LEAGUE CUP 
FINAL WITH EVERTON THAT WAS A 
PERFECT EXAMPLE OF PLAYING AGAINST 
ARSENAL THE LONGER THAT THEY 
PERSEVERED AND KEPT ARSENAL OUT 
THE EASIER IT IS TO PLAY HOPEFULLY 
LEEDS HAVE LEARNED FROM THAT A PRETTY CLEAR FOUL AN EASY 
DECISION FOR THE REFEREE SHE WAS 
LUCKY TO ESCAPE BUT BOOKING IN 
TRUTH 
ESCAPE A BOOKING SOPHIE TRUTH WILL LAUGH AT THAT LATER I I UNDERSTAND MOST REFEREES TO KNOW 
HER NAME PRETTY WELL 
HER BROTHER 
HAS A FAMOUS SISTER 
SIMON WALTON 
OF HULL CITY IS SOPHIE'S BROTHER 
FROM THE MEN'S GAME HE HAS A BIG 
COUPLE OF WEEKS AHEAD FAYE WHITE FOR THE SECOND TIME NARROWLY FAILING THESE DEFENDERS HAVE TO GET IN 
FRONT I KNOW SHE IS TALL BUT YOU 
HAVE TO COMPETE WHEN THE BALL COMES 
OVER FROM SET PIECES 
I KNOW FOR A 
WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW SHE WILL BE 
CURSING HERSELF FOR NOT GETTING ON 
THE END OF THOSE I KNOW FAYE FAYE IS AN ABSOLUTE PROFESSIONAL RICK PASSMOOR GOES DOWN TO THE 
TOUCHLINE DIRECTING OPERATIONS I I THINK HE WILL BE QUITE PLEASED WITH 
THE FIRST TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES 
I THINK HE 
WILL BE DELIGHTED LEANNE HALL HIS 
ASSISTANT WITH HIM PLAYED IN A 
COUPLE OF CUP FINALS FOR DONCASTER 
YANKEY HELD ON TO LONG I THINK IF YANKEY HAD BEEN RIGHT PUTTER SHE 
WOULD HAVE STRUCK THAT STRAIGHT 
AWAY A RIGHT OF THE TURF THAT THAT REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING 
INTO THE BEST CHANCE OF THE GAME SO 
FAR JAYNE LUDLOW WAS FURIOUS THE 
BALL DIDN'T WORK ITS WAY OVER TO 
HER KAREN CARNEY SLIPPED AS SHE HIT IT 
SHE CAUGHT IT INCREDIBLY WELL BUT 
IT WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR HER 
TO BE ON TARGET AS SHE SLEPT SHE 
POWERED THE BALL WIDE 
UNFORTUNATELY FOR ARSENAL IF RACHEL HAD HIT THAT WITH HER 
RIGHT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD AN 
OPPORTUNITY GOOD PLAY BY KELLY 
SMITH JUST HOW WAS THROUGH RACHEL RACHEL YANKEY IS PLAYING IN HER EIGHTH F. A. CUP 
FINAL SHE HAS CAUGHT IN THREE OF 
THEM SHE SCORED THE THIRD IN 
ARSENAL'S FIVE TO ZERO VICTORY AGAINST 
MILLWALL SHE LEANT BACK AS SHE STRUCK IT 
GOALWARDS KELLY SMITH HAVING A 
WORD WITH KAREN CARNEY THERE ARE 
FEW SIGNS OF ARSENAL FRUSTRATION 
DEVELOPING 
YOU CAN SEE HOW DEVELOPING POWERFUL SANDERSON'S STRIKE IS 
KELLY SMITH IS ONLY A BIT SMALLER 
THAN ME BUT SHE IS SO POWERFUL AND 
STRONG THAT YOU CAN'T GET THE BALL 
FROM HER LIANNE SANDERSON HAS NOT BEEN ABLE 
TO FIND THE NET FOR ARSENAL WHO 
HAVE BEEN TOTALLY DOMINANT BUT WE 
DID NOT EXPECT ANYTHING ELSE LEEDS 
UNITED ARE HOLDING ON WELL AND 
THEIR GOALKEEPER CARLY TELFORD IS 
HAVING A GAME PAUL LEEDS IF THEY GET AN 
OPPORTUNITY COMING FORWARD THEY 
HAVE TO BE DECISIVE AND CREATE AN 
OPPORTUNITY ON GOAL BEFORE LEEDS 
THERE WILL NOT BE MANY 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM STRAIGHT INTO THE MORE THAN CAPABLE BLUBS OF CARLY TELFORD GLOVES AMANDA BARR IS HAVING TO DROP SO 
DEEP TO GET ANYWHERE NEAR THE BALL 
WE WILL GIVE CARLY TELFORD THAT ONE 
SHE DESERVES IT 
IT WAS FOR THE 
CAMERAS IT SHOWS HOW MUCH 
CONCENTRATION IS NEEDED BY A KEEPER 
FOR NINETY MINUTES WITH THE YOU HAVE 
THE BALL OR NOT WHETHER YOU HAVE 
THE BALL OR NOT 
ARSENAL ARE NOW 
RESORTING TO SHOOTING FROM TWENTY FIVE YARDS 
PLUS 
THE THING IS THEY CAN SCORE PLUS FROM THAT DISTANCE WHICH IS THE 
WORRYING THING FOR LEEDS THAT WAS CARLY TELFORD'S ONE HORAN 
MOMENT FOR THE GAME SO FAR IT WAS 
NEVER GOING TO LEAD TO ANYTHING 
SIGNIFICANT HORROR MOMENT I THINK LEEDS NEED TO GET THE LIKES 
OF JESSICA CLARKE ON THE BALL MORE 
TO CREATE SOMETHING A BRILLIANT FINISH BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER IT IS OFFSIDE I KNOW 
THE WHISTLE HAD GONE BUT THE QUALITY OF AMANDA BARR'S 
FINISHES HIS SECOND TO NONE IF SHE 
GETS A CHANCE I EXPECT IT TO GET 
AWAY 
IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION AWAY JUST IT WAS L. THOUGHT MAYBE SHE JUST DID KNOW BUT SHE DID NOT HAVE CLUE 
SHE DIDN'T SEE THE BLACK OR HEAR 
THE WHISTLE SHE WENT ON TO FINISH 
SUPERBLY SEE THE FLAG 
YOU DON'T 
TEND TO HEAR BECAUSE OF THE CROWD 
AND THE HORNS YOU CARRY ON UNTIL 
SOMEBODY SHOUTS LOUDLY PARDON PARDON JOKE THERE HAS BEEN A TERRIFIC 
ATMOSPHERE FROM THREE HOURS BEFORE 
KICK OFF WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE 
CITY GROUND THIS MORNING PLENTY OF 
PEOPLE WERE MILLING AROUND 
NOTTINGHAM HAS STAGED PORT OF 
WOMEN'S FOOTBALL THROUGH THE WEEK 
THEY HAD A MAJOR TOURNAMENT 
YESTERDAY A CARNIVAL OF WOMEN'S 
FOOTBALL I THINK THIS COULD BECOME 
A REGULAR FIXTURE ON THE CALENDAR 
NOTTINGHAM IS DOING ITSELF PROUD NOTTINGHAM HAD DONE WELL THEY DID 
WELL LAST YEAR AND THAT IS 
OBVIOUSLY WHY THEY HAVE GOT IT 
AGAIN THIS YEAR THE CROWDS TURN UP 
AND IT IS A FAMILY ATMOSPHERE IT 
IS IMPORTANT FOR YOUNG GIRLS TO BE 
ABLE TO SEE THEIR HEROES IN ACTION KATIE HOLTHAM IS FROM JUST DOWN THE 
ROAD HER FAMILY ARE HERE AGAIN 
SHE SCORED AFTER THE FIRST MINUTE 
OF THE GAME FOR CHARLTON LAST 
SEASON FOR NO AVAIL FAYE WHITE PUT IT OVER THE TOP SHE 
WILL BE LIVID ABOUT THAT THAT WAS 
ON A PLATE FOR THE ENGLAND CAPTAIN 
YOU CANNOT GIVE FAYE WHITE THAT 
MUCH SPACE THEY JUST DROPPED OFF 
HER THAT IS A FREE HEADER IF EVER 
THERE WAS ONE FAYE HAS SCORED FIVE GOALS FOR 
ARSENAL THIS SEASON IN THE LEAGUE 
SHE CAME BACK FROM THE SECOND 
CRUCIATE LIGAMENT INJURY TO LEAD 
ENGLAND IN THE WORLD CUP LAST YEAR I REMEMBER IN PARTICULAR THAT GAME 
WHERE ENGLAND TOOK GERMANY ALL THE 
WAY FAYE WHITE WAS MAGNIFICENT I I HAVE SPOKEN TO HER A FEW TIMES 
ABOUT MY CRUCIATE INJURY SHE HAS 
HAD HIRST TWICE HIRST TWICE 
OVER THE TOP AND LITTLE WIDE HERS TWICE SOPHIE BRADLEY WAS TREKKING AND 
GETTING ACROSS JUST A BIT OF 
TIREDNESS AND NERVOUS ENERGY 
TREKKING LEEDS IS GOOD BECAUSE 
ARSENAL COULD NOT PUT IT ON TARGET 
LEEDS ESCAPE EMMA BYRNE FOR THE MOST PART 
MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN SITTING 
WITH US 
NOBODY REALISED HOW GOOD 
SHE WAS UNTIL THEY WATCHED THE WAY 
THE CUP FINAL LAST YEAR SHE WAS 
SUPERB BUT SHE DOES SPEND A LOT OF 
THE TIME NOT PUTTING MUCH EFFORT IN 
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO L. WAS 
GOING TO SAY LOOKING GLAMOUROUS 
BUT THAT SOUNDED A BIT PATRONISING SHE HAD A SPELL PLAYING IN SWEDEN FOR A WHILE SANDERSON HAD THE TIME TO TURN WE 
HAVE SEEN HER SCORE THAT SORT OF 
GOAL BEFORE THIS TIME NOT INTO 
THE TOP CORNER 
YOU WOULD BE AMAZED 
HOW MANY TIMES LIANNE SANDERSON 
SCORES LIKE THAT IN THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE SHE IS A TERRIFIC FINISHER 
A LOT OF PRESSURE ON BY SOPHIE 
WALTON AND STEPH HOUGHTON MANAGED 
TO PUT THE BALL OVER THE TOP SOPHIE WALTON JUST DOING ENOUGH TO PUT HER OFF AT THE LAST TELFORD IS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER COULD PLAY AGAIN BY CARLY TELFORD 
EVERYTHING THAT HAS COME TOWARDS 
HER SHE HAS BEEN EQUAL TO IT AND 
BATTERED 
SHE IS STOPPING BATTERED EVERYTHING EQUAL TO IT AND 
BETTER LEEDS WILL KNOW THAT CANNOT 
CONTINUE FOR THE WHOLE GAME SURELY 
THEY HAVE TO TRY TO CREATE 
SOMETHING OF THEIR OWN BUT I'M 
SURE GETTING TO HALF TIME GOAL LESS 
WILL BE THE FOCUS NOW ANITA ASANTE IS SUCH A GOOD 
DEFENDER SHE DIDN'T TOUCH THE BALL 
BUT PUT JESSICA CLARKE OFF ENOUGH 
TO KICK THE BALL OUT FOR THROW IN 
CARLY TELFORD'S LATEST STOP WAS 
ACTUALLY A MISTAKE A POOR 
CLEARANCE 
KAREN CARNEY A GOOD CLEARANCE EFFORT GOOD DEPENDING AS WELL 
GETTING HOLD OF THE SECOND BALL 
DEFENDING 
WE HAVE SEEN EVERY TYPE DEFENDING OF SAVED FROM HER 
SHE IS SUCH A 
SHOW OF EVERY TYPE OF SAVOURED JESSICA WRIGHT IS DOWN REQUIRING TREATMENT 
YOU CAN SEE HOW HOT IT TREATMENT IS THE GIRLS ARE STRUGGLING A BIT 
A WELCOME REST WHICH GIVES THE 
MANAGER THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A 
WORD 
THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT RICK WORD PASSMOOR SURELY WILL BE THE HAPPIER 
OF THE TWO COACHES AT THE MOMENT 
ABSOLUTELY HE CAME INTO THIS GAME 
WITH GAME PLAN L. THINK THE ONLY 
THING HE WOULD SAY IS HE WANTS HIS 
FORWARDS ON THE BALL A BIT MORE AND 
A BIT MORE COMPOSURE IN THE MID 
FIELDERS TO GET HOLD OF THE BALL 
AND PASS IT YOU TEND TO BE NERVOUS 
WHEN YOU GET HOLD OF THE BALL WE 
HAVE SEEN THAT FROM A FEW LEEDS 
PLAYERS ENJOYING THE DAY OUT JUST OVER 
TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED HERE IT WILL BE ABOUT THE 
SAME THIS YEAR VIC AKERS WAS 
SAYING IN THE BUILD UP HE WOULD 
RATHER IT HAD BEEN AT WEMBLEY HE 
WAS SAYING IT WAS ABOUT TIME THE F. A. 
WOMEN'S CUP GOT THAT RECOGNITION 
WHICH IS FAIR ENOUGH BUT NOT HIM 
DOES ITSELF JUSTICE 
EVERY OTHER 
MAJOR FINAL IS AT WEMBLEY SO WHY 
NOT THE WOMEN IT 
WAS BLOCKED BY KATIE HOLTHAM WAS IT SAVED BY AIR 
BY THE SHEER 
TWO HANDS AND THAT MAYBE JUST THE 
ONE THAT IS WHY IT WAS NOT HAND 
BALL I THINK SHE GOT TWO HANDS ON 
THAT FIRST MOMENT OF REAL CONTROVERSY IN 
THE GAME KATIE HOLTHAM MIGHT JUST 
HAVE GOT AWAY WITH ONE INSIDER OWN 
PENALTY AREA THERE WERE STRONG 
ARSENAL SHOUTS WE WILL HAVE A LOOK 
BACK AT 
IT JUST AS SOON AS WE CAN YANKEY SETS UP LUDLOW ONCE AGAIN IT IS SKY OF 
THEY ARE CREATING 
THE OPPORTUNITIES AND THAT IS THE 
IMPORTANT THING FOR ARSENAL THAT THAT IS THE ONE WE HAVE JUST SEEN GOAL 
OF THE TOP WAS THERE A REAL CASE 
FOR A PENALTY L. DO NOT THINK SHE 
KNOWS A LOT ABOUT THAT 
SHE DOES 
NOT BUT SHE DID GET BOTH HANDS ON 
IT 
WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN AGREED L. IT I MOAN ABOUT EVERYTHING SO WHY WOULD 
HAVE MOANED ABOUT THAT BUT I DO 
NOT THINK SHE COULD HAVE GOT THEIR 
HANDS OUT OF THE WAY WE WOULD GIVE 
HER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT BUT 
NOT HAVE I HAD BEEN THE ONE 
SHOOTING 
I DID DETECT A SMILE ON SHOOTING HER FACE AS SHE GOT BACK TO HER 
FEET 
SHE HAS PROBABLY BEEN FEET PRACTISING THAT 
EVERYBODY IS 
SAVING THEM FOR LEEDS TODAY MARY PHILLIP IS IN CLOSE ATTENDANCE 
I SHE WILL BE ALL DAY IT IS A 
LEEDS CORNER 
SUE SMITH RARELY 
GIVES IT AWAY AND CREATE AN 
OPPORTUNITY FOR JESS CLARKE TO 
ATTACK MARY PHILLIP AND THAT IS 
WHERE WE HAVE GOT TO GO DOWN THE 
LINE WE HAVE GOT A CORNER THREE THREE MINUTES OF THAT FIRST HALF TO GO 
LEEDS' FIRST CORNER OF THE GAME 
THE FIRST THING EMMA BYRNE HAS HAD 
TO DO ALL DAY SHE PASS THE BALL 
BEHIND 
I THINK SHE DID NOT EXPECT BEHIND THAT AND THAT WAS GOING IN IT IS 
A GOOD JOB SHE IS SIX F. T. TWO SHE WAS 
UNDER PRESSURE IN THE END SUE SMITH WILL HAVE ANOTHER GO A CLEVER BALL BACK TO SUE SMITH BY PORTON HOUGHTON HANDBALL NOT GIVEN CAN ARSENAL STRAIGHT AWAY THAT IS THE DANGER FOR LEEDS PUSH 
EVERYONE UP FOR A CORNER AND 
ARSENAL BREAKS SO QUICKLY THEY THEY HAVE BEEN STOPPED FROM BREAKING SO 
RAPIDLY BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO BE 
A FREE KICK KELLY SMITH DOWN 
LEEDS HAVE REALISED THAT IS THE 
ONLY WAY TO SLOW THE ATTACK DOWN A 
SMIDGEN OF A HAND BALL BUT THAT IS 
ONE EACH NOW CANCELLED OUT 
I WILL 
LET YOU GET AWAY WITH THAT FAYE WHITE POLICED BY JESS WRIGHT SANDERSON WAS FIRST TO REACT GOOD 
PLAY SHE STEPPED IN FRONT OF THE 
DEFENDER WHILE EVERYBODY ELSE WAS 
WATCHING IT FAYE WHITE'S EFFORT WAS ALWAYS 
BOBBLING WIDE 
SOPHIE WALTON WAS A 
LITTLE BIT INDECISIVE WITH WHAT SHE 
WAS GOING TO DO WITH IT THERE AND 
ENDED UP GETTING HARDLY ANY POWER 
ON THE HEADER THAT GIVES FAYE A 
CHANCE TO SWING A LAGAT IT LUCKILY 
FOR SOPHIE IT WAS THE RIGHT SIDE 
OF THE POST FOR THERE SHE WANTED 
TO GIVE IT A BIG WAG BUT FAYE GOT 
IN FRONT OF HER 
INTO FIRST HALF 
STOPPAGE TIME NOW IF LEEDS COULD GET THE BALL INTO 
THAT LAST THIRD AND PUT ARSENAL 
UNDER PRESSURE THEN THE DEAD JUST 
ONE AND THAT BALL WHEN USUALLY SHE 
MIGHT CALMLY TIGHT 
DOUBT ANY DOUBT ANY DEAD JUST SWUNG AT THAT ONE ARSENAL HAVE HAD A CHANCE AFTER 
CHANCE WAVE AFTER WAVE OF ATTACKS 
BUT LEEDS ON THE ONLY TEAM TO OF AT 
THE BALL IN THE NET SO FAR SHE WAS 
OFFSIDE 
YES SHE WAS A MYHILL OFFSIDE OFFSIDE MAYBE ONE LAST CHANCE SHE SAW IT OPEN UP FOR A SHOT AT 
MUST HAVE HEARD A SHOT AS WELL 
GOOD PLAY BY STEPH HOUGHTON THE 
DECIDED TO DUCK OVER THE TOP OF IT 
INSTEAD OF TAKING IT DOWN AND MAYBE 
CREATING ANOTHER CHANCE FOR ARSENAL 
ALEX GOT IN THE MID OF THE ACTION 
FOR ARSENAL AGAIN ALEX SCOTT 
THE REFEREE HAS HAD A LOOK AT HER 
WATCH IT IS HALF TIME IN 
NOTTINGHAM IN THE THIRTIETH F. A. CUP 
FINAL SO FAR SO GOOD BUT RICK 
PASSMORE'S LEEDS HAS HELD FIRM AND 
KEPT OUT WAVE AFTER WAVE OF ARSENAL 
ATTACKING PRESSURE THE LEEDS 
GOALKEEPER IS HAVING AN ABSOLUTELY 
WONDERFUL MATCH AT THE BREAK IT 
IS CLOSE ZERO TO ZERO 
AN ENTERTAINING FIRST HALF LOTS OF 
CHANCES MOSTLY FOR ARSENAL THE 
MESSAGE FROM RICK PASSMORE AT HALF 
TIME IS THAT IS HALF OF THE JOB 
WELL DONE 
DEFINITELY LEEDS HAVE 
COME WITH A GAME PLAN AND WORKED 
REALLY HARD AND GONE IN AT HALF 
TIME WITH A ZERO TO ZERO DRAW 
YOUR ENGLAND 
GOALKEEPING RIVAL OR FRIEND YOU 
SAID BEFORE THE GAME THAT SHE WOULD 
RISE TO THE OCCASION AND THAT IS 
EXACTLY WHAT CARLY TELFORD HAS DONE 
SHE HAS BEEN OUTSTANDING IN THIS 
FIRST HALF SHE HAS ALLOWED LEEDS 
TO GO IN WITH A ZERO TO ZERO DRAW AT HALF 
TIME OUTSTANDING SAVES 
WE HAD 
EARLY FEARS FOR LEEDS BECAUSE THEY 
WERE ONE GOAL DOWN INSIDE THREE 
MINUTES FIVE YEARS AGO 
THEY HAVE 
DONE REALLY WELL ALTHOUGH I HAVE 
BEEN AMAZED THAT ARSENAL HAVE NOT 
SCORED SCOTT HAS BEEN UP AND DOWN 
THE RIGHT HAND SIDE AND HAS 
BASICALLY HAD FREE REIN TO DO WHAT 
SHE WANTS SHE IS MAKING LATE RUNS 
SHE GETS IN EARLY ON AND AT THIS 
STAGE WITH A COUPLE OF MINUTES GONE 
IT IS CLEARED OFF THE LINE BY 
BRADLEY WHO HAS HAD A GOOD GAME 
TO BE HONEST AS SHE COMES IN THAT IS GOOD 
COVERING DEFENDING FROM BRADLEY 
BUT THAT HAS BEEN A REAL PROBLEM 
FOR LEEDS THE SPACE THAT SCOTT HAS 
BEEN GIVEN 
LET'S DISCUSS ARSENAL 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN PRETTY 
SPECIAL PEOPLE ARE THINKING IT IS 
ZERO TO ZERO BUT IT IS CARLY TELFORD ONE 
ARSENAL ZERO 
LIKE I SAID SHE HAS 
BEEN THE DOMINANT FIGURE FOR LEEDS 
THIS HALF AS MUCH AS ARSENAL HAVE 
BEEN DOMINANT 
THIS IS CARLY 
TELFORD AND ALL OF THEIR GLORY 
GAVIN SHE HAS SAVED THE BALL WITH 
JUST ABOUT EVERY PART OF THEIR BODY 
YOU NEED A GOALKEEPER TO HAVE A 
GOOD GAME THAT WAS FROM SMITH 
FANTASTIC POINT BLANK SAVE SHE DID 
NOT REALLY SHE MADE HERSELF ALL 
RIGHT IT WAS STRAIGHT AT HER BUT 
SHE DID NOT GO DOWN TOO EARLY FROM 
SHE BEGAN TO GROW IN 
THERE SHE BEGAN TO GROW IN CONFIDENCE AND THIS IS SCOTT 
COMING DOWN THE RIGHT HAND SIDE 
WATCH THIS FOR A ONE TWO BACK TO 
SCOTT AGAIN AT THIRTY THING SHE HAS 
JUST SMASHED IT ONTO THE BAR BUT 
TELFORD GETS HAND TO IT AT 
FIRST YOU THINK 
SHE WHAT IS THE 
PLAYER MO FROM LEFT TO RIGHT 
MOVING ACROSS THE GOAL GETTING 
INTO A GREAT POSITION 
HAVE YOU 
BEEN SURPRISED BY HOW WELL SHE HAS 
DONE RACHEL 
NOT AT ALL WE WERE 
TRAINING TOGETHER LAST WEEK AND SHE 
IS PULLING OF SAVES LIKE THAT ALL 
THE TIME SHE IS VERY CONFIDENT 
THAT IS GROWING NOW 
SHE HAS GOT 
GOOD HEIGHT AS WELL 
SHE IS VERY 
AGILE AS WELL 
THIS IS THE 
SANDERSON CHANCE GOOD REFLEX SAVE 
PUSHING IT AWAY FROM DANGER THERE THERE POSITIONING MAKES IT VERY HARD FOR 
THE ATTACKERS SHE MAKES THE GOAL 
LOOKED VERY SMALL THERE IS NOT A 
LOT TO AIM FOR 
THIS EMPHASISES THE 
VALUE OF HAVING A BIT OF HEIGHT 
BECAUSE FROM LUDLOW HERE SHE JUST 
TIPPED IT OVER GOOD FEET SHE SHE WATCHES IT ALL THE WAY BACK STEPS 
BACKWARDS NOT A SIMPLE TOUCH OVER 
BUT SHE GOT IN THE RIGHT POSITION 
AND MAKES THE SAVE EASIER 
SHE HAS 
BEEN THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE TWELVE 
MONTHS AGO JAYNE LUDLOW HAD A 
CHANCE LIKE THAT JUST BEFORE HALF 
TIME AND IT WAS IN THE BACK OF THE 
NET 
EXACTLY WHAT THE COMMENTATOR NET WAS SAYING THAT IS WE ARE LOOKING 
AT THE DOMINANCE OF ARSENAL NOT 
THE NEGATIVES OF THE OPPOSITION 
GOALKEEPER WHICH IS A GOOD THING 
FOR THE GAME CARLY IS PROVING THAT 
THERE ARE EXCELLENT FEMALE 
GOALKEEPERS OUT THERE 
SO CAN SHE 
KEEP ON DOING IT FOR ANOTHER FORTY FIVE 
MINUTES 
I AM SURE SHE CAN WE SAW MINUTES ONE NEGATIVE NOT SUCH A GOOD KICK 
BUT SHE MADE UP FOR IT USING 
ANOTHER PART OF THE BODY VERY VERY ASSURED THE AMOUNT OF TIME SHE HAS 
DONE UP MADE HERSELF BIG USING 
HER FEET THEIR CONFIDENCE SHE IS 
UP FOR IT 
AND I IMAGINE THAT 
CONFIDENCE WILL THE TEAM WHEN THEY 
SEE THEIR GOALKEEPER DOING ARE ON 
THE CUP THIS YEAR 
IF YOU HAVE GOT 
A SOLID LINE OF DEFENCE THE LAST 
LINE BEING CARLY TELFORD YOU GIVE 
YOURSELF HALF A CHANCE ARSENAL ARSENAL HAVE HAD OTHER CHANCES AS WELL 
LEEDS WILL BE SLIGHTLY COUNTING 
THEIR BLESSINGS 
TYPICAL ARSENAL 
REALLY RELENTLESS THEY HAVE GOT 
PACE AND POWER GOING FORWARD AS 
YOU SAY IT IS THAT JUST LIANNE 
SANDERSON ALEX SCOTT CAN COME FROM 
RIGHT BACK AND SCORE L. AM SURE 
THEY WILL BE FEELING UNLUCKY AT 
HALF TIME 
A COUPLE OF THE ARSENAL HALF TIME CHANCES LEEDS HAVE NOT DEFENDED 
BADLY BUT THEY HAVE BEEN LUCKY AT 
TIMES 
THEY HAVE HAD TO SCRAMBLE IT TIMES AWAY TELFORD HAS BEEN BRILLIANT 
BUT EVEN WHEN SHE HAS BEEN UNDER 
PRESSURE TWO HANDS ON THE BALL 
HERE SHE GETS A NUDGE FROM 
SANDERSON THERE ARE PLAYERS AROUND 
HIM 
A FOUL AND YOUR BOOK 
AS THE HIM BALL POPS UP IT ENDS UP TWO AND 
SON THE BALL AND LIANNE'S EYES ARE 
NOT ON THE BALL IT IS A FOUL FOR 
ME 
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR ARSENAL ME HERE 
THIS IS INTERESTING IT COMES HERE ACROSS TO EON AND WHEN SHE SLIPS 
SHE CONNECT REALLY WELL CARNEY 
ARSENAL HAVE HAD SO MANY CHANCES IN 
THIS GAME I WILL BE AMAZED IF 
LEEDS CAN HOLD OUT THEY NEED TO GO 
DOWN THE OTHER END AND HAVE A 
THREAT 
FAYE WHITE USUALLY THREAT THREATENS BUT SHE HAS NOT SHOWN 
TODAY 
THAT IS A REALLY GOOD TODAY OPPORTUNITY FOR HER TO FINISH SHE SHE HAS HAD A COUPLE OF GOOD CHANCES 
AND I CANNOT BELIEVE SHE HAS NOT 
SCORED WITH ALEX SCOTT FROM RIGHT 
BACK FOR A WIDE FROM CENTRE HALF 
JUST BEFORE HALF TIME WE FOUND OUT 
THERE IS NOT JUST ONE DECENT 
GOALKEEPER IN THE LEEDS SIDE THERE 
MIGHT BE TWO WAS THIS PENALTY 
FOR YOU 
I AM NOT TOO SURE L. THINK 
SHE IS LOOKING AWAY FROM THE BALL 
BUT AS IT COMES DOWN SHE IS 
FALLING HER HANDS TO STRIKE THE 
BALL AND TWENTY STAR A GOALSCORING 
OPPORTUNITY WITH YOUR HANDS IT IS 
A PENALTY AND WHEN YOU STOP A 
GOALSCORING OPPORTUNITY LEEDS 
WOULD FEEL UNLUCKY GAVIN THINK GAVIN I THINK SHE SLIPS THERE L. AM NOT SURE 
ACTUALLY MY FIRST INSTINCT WAS 
PENALTY BUT HER FEET JUST GIVE 
AWAY AS SHE TURNS SHE ACTUALLY 
THROUGH THE BODY AT THE BALL BUT 
MAYBE SHE SLIPS A BIT 
ZERO TO ZERO AT HALF 
TIME WE WILL TALK ABOUT HOW LEEDS 
WILL COPE IN A FEW MOMENTS BUT A 
DECADE AGO SHE SCORED IN THE F. A. CUP 
FINAL BUT LOST TO ARSENAL SINCE 
THEN AS THE GAME HAS LEVELLED THAT 
BROWN SHE SEEMS TO HAVE ALWAYS 
BEEN THERE GIVING EVERYONE A 
LITTLE BIT OF HOPE 
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG KID I WANTED TO 
BE A PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLER 
COULD NOT BE HOW CAN I EARN SOME 
MONEY IN THE GAME OUR COACH AND 
HERE 
I AM TEN YEARS LATER OH GOD I CAME FROM PLAYING END OF THE 
SEASON STRAIGHT INTO MANAGEMENT 
SO OBVIOUSLY IT WAS VERY NEW A 
CLEAN SLATE ONE THING I DID DO WAS 
COMPARE THE NUMBER OF GAMES THEY 
YEAR FOR OURSELVES COMPARED TO 
GERMANY HOW MANY CAPS THEY GOT L. L. 
THINK OURS WAS FOUR FIVE OR SIX 
MAXIMUM WHEREAS THEIRS WAS FIFTEEN 
YEAR SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS 
I THOUGHT DEFINITELY NEEDED 
CHANGING WE NEEDED MORE 
INTERNATIONALS THAT WAS ONE OF THE 
THINGS I WANTED TO CHANGE AND HAD 
TO FIGHT FOR 
IN TERMS OF 
PERCEPTIONS OF THE WOMEN'S GAME 
HAVE YOU NOTICED MUCH DIFFERENCE 
ABSOLUTELY IT IS NOT SO MUCH TO DO 
NOW IT IS NOT OH GIRLS PLAYING 
FOOTBALL ARE YOU SURE IT IS NICE 
THAT THE GAME HAS MOVED ON WITH 
THE HELP OF THE MEDIA BECAUSE MORE 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO IT 
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY OTHER HIGHLIGHTS 
OF YOUR TIME IN CHARGE DEFINITELY DEFINITELY QUALIFYING FOR THE WORLD CUP AND 
DEFINITELY BEING PART OF IT L. 
ACTUALLY REMEMBER THE OPENING GAME 
JAPAN AND JUST SITTING STANDING 
IN THE DUG OUT AND THINKING THIS 
IS REALLY GOOD I QUITE LIKE THIS 
I TURNED ROUND TO DAWN SCOTT THE 
EXERCISE SCIENTIST AND WENT 
WHATEVER HAPPENS WE HAVE DONE WELL 
A DISAPPOINTING THAT WE GOT KNOCKED 
OUT BUT GLAD TO BE PART OF IT IS IS THAT THE DISAPPOINTMENT BIGGEST 
DISAPPOINTMENT OF YOUR TIME IN 
CHARGE 
YES WE TRULY BELIEVED WE CHARGE COULD BEAT THE U. S. A. WE WERE DOING 
WELL IT WAS A BIG CHALLENGE 
PERHAPS THE WAY WE LOST IT IS 
QUITE HARD TO TAKE BUT IT MAKES 
YOU APPRECIATE LOOK WE WANT TO 
QUALIFY FOR THE NEXT ONE 
THE F. A. 
ARE IN CONSULTATION AS TO HOW TO 
TAKE THE GAME FORWARD WITH THOUGHTS 
ABOUT A SUMMER LEAGUE WHAT ARE 
YOUR THOUGHTS 
I ENDORSE IT AND 
PROMOTE IT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO 
COMPETE AGAINST THEM IN SLEEP T. V. 
MEDIA IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER 
AGAINST THE MEN'S LEAGUE THE 
LEAGUE NEEDS TO BECOME MORE 
COMPETITIVE 
HAVE YOU BEEN TEMPTED COMPETITIVE TO WALK AWAY AT ANY STAGE 
AT TIMES 
I GUESS SO IT IS TIRING HARD WORK 
IT IS THE TRAVELLING WHICH 
EVERYBODY THINKS HIS GLAMOUROUS IT 
ISN'T AT TIMES I FELT I NEED SIX 
MONTHS OF WHERE I CAN STAY HOME AND 
NOT DO ANYTHING AND GO IN MY GARDEN 
AND RELAXED BUT ONCE YOU ARE IN 
IT AND WORKING WITH THE PLAYERS AND 
THE STAFF YOU GET THAT BARS AGAIN 
HAVE YOU COME CLOSE TO SAYING I 
CAN'T DO THIS ANY MORE 
I HAVE SAID 
IT HUNDRED TIMES OF COURSE YOU CAN 
O. K. 
ARE YOU UP FOR ANOTHER TEN O. K. YEARS 
PROBABLY NOT L. WILL BE TOO YEARS OLD IT IS MY PASSION TO BE 
INVOLVED IN FOOTBALL IN SOME WAY 
WHAT THAT WILL BE WE WILL HAVE TO 
THAT DECISION YOU ARE THE 
MAKE THAT DECISION YOU ARE THE FIRST WOMAN TO PASS THE WAY FOR PRO 
LICENCE ARE YOU TEMPTED TO USE IT 
IN THE MEN'S GAME 
MAKE ME AN OFFER 
I CAN'T REFUSE AND I WOULD 
CONSIDERATE I AM HAPPY WITH WHAT 
I'M DOING AT THE MOMENT CONSIDER 
IT WE ARE NOT THE BEST TEAM IN THE 
WORLD GERMANY HAVE BEEN FOR SO 
MANY YEARS ONE OF MY AMBITIONS IS 
TO BEAT GERMANY AND WIN SOMETHING 
RACHEL YOU PLAYED UNDER HER DO 
YOU THINK SHE IS COACH THAT CAN 
MAKE THE MOVE TO THE MEN'S GAME AS AS YOU HEARD SHE IS THE FIRST WOMAN 
TO GET PROFESSIONAL LICENCE SHE 
HAS EVERYTHING ON PAPER FIVE TEN 
YEARS AGO WE NEVER THOUGHT WE 
WOULD SEE A FEMALE ASSISTANT 
REFEREES OR REFEREES IN THE MEN'S 
GAME AND THAT HAS HAPPENED I I THINK THE DRUMMERS HAVE GONE TO THE 
OTHER END OF THE CITY GROUND WHICH 
IS HELPFUL HOPE HAS THE 
QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE THE 
QUESTION IS IS THE MEN'S GAME 
READY FOR OF WOMEN COACH 
SHE IS 
HIGHLY RESPECTED IT WOULD BE VERY 
DIFFICULT FOR HER YOU SAW WHAT 
HAPPENED WITH CLIVE WOODWARD COMING 
TO THE HOUSE TO SOUTHAMPTON A 
DIFFERENT SPORT BUT IT DID HAPPEN 
TO HIM FOR A WOMAN MANAGER TO 
BREAK THROUGH THEY HAVE TO TAKE 
HOLD OF A NON LEAGUE CLUB GET THEM 
PROMOTED AND EARNED THE RESPECT AND 
CONFIDENCE OF THE PLAYERS VERY 
DIFFICULT IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE 
BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN MADE ABOUT 
WOMEN'S OFFICIALS YOU WOULD NOT 
HAVE BOUGHT YOU WOULD SEE THEM IN 
THE GAME TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO HOW HOW CLOSE IS HOPE TO ACHIEVING HER 
DREAM 
NOT R. OFF WE HAD SOME DREAM GREAT TALENT IN THIS COUNTRY IT IS 
JUST SHOWING THE YOUNGER GIRLS 
COMING THROUGH WE PROVED IN THE 
EUROS WE DID WELL WE WERE NOT AS 
HAPPY AS WE WOULD LIKE TO BE BUT 
GOING INTO THE WORLD CUP WE DID 
EVEN BETTER L. AM SURE THE NEXT 
YEAR WE WILL GO ONE STEP FURTHER 
LET'S TURN ATTENTION TO THE SECOND 
HALF PEOPLE WILL COME TO THIS 
THINKING LEEDS HAVE DONE WELL TO 
SURVIVE WHAT DO THEY NEED TO DO TO 
TURN IT INTO VICTORY 
THE NEED TO 
THREATEN THE ARSENAL GOAL MORE A 
SET PIECE PERHAPS OR A BREAKAWAY 
CHANCE WE MENTIONED AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAMME AMANDA 
BARR A SHE WAS OFFSIDE BUT SHE DIDN'T 
KNOW WHAT ABOUT THAT POOR FINISH 
THEY HAVE SOMEONE WITHIN THEIR 
RANKS THAT CAN PUT THE BALL AWAY A 
GREAT BALL IN FROM SUE SMITH 
SCRAMBLED AWAY IN THE END WE WE MENTIONED HOW DELIGHTED RICK 
PASSMOOR IS GOING TO BE WITH HIS 
LEEDS GIRLS WHAT WOULD BE THE 
MESSAGE FOR ARSENAL 
REMAIN PATIENT 
AND STICK TO THEIR PLAN TOWARDS 
THE END THEY WERE TAKING LONG 
RANGE SHOT WHERE THEY DIDN'T NEED 
TO 
LEEDS HAVE WON THREE PENALTY TO SHOOT OUT ON THE WEIGHT TO THIS 
FINAL CAN YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING 
I'M SURE I COULD IF THEY CONTINUE 
TO PLAY THE WAY THEY DID I DON'T 
SEE WHY NOT 
ONE OF THE FEARS FOR 
LEEDS IS THAT JULIE FLEETING IS ON 
THE BENCH FOR ARSENAL SHE IS A 
GREAT PLAY IT 
SHE IS SOMEONE WHO 
COULD COME ON AND CHANGE AGAIN A 
GREAT PLAYER THEY HAVE ENOUGH 
PLAYERS TO SCORE A GOAL IF THEY 
CAN KEEP THE PRESSURE GOING THEY 
WILL BREAK THROUGH LEEDS NEED TO 
SHOW SOME TEETH 
VERY HOT OUT THERE 
HOW DO YOU SEE THIS SECOND HALF 
GOING 
AS LONG AS LEEDS CAN STEM GOING THE ATTACK AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TEN 
MINUTES THEY WILL KEEP THEMSELVES 
IN THE GAME 
CAN ARSENAL 
DISAPPEARED OUT OF SIGHT IN THE 
SECOND HALF TIME TO HAND YOU OVER 
TO THE MATCH COMMENTATORS LYSINE 
LUCY WARD AND GUY MOWBRAY IT IS BEAUTIFUL OUT HERE I'M SURE 
IT IS HOT OUT IN THE MIDDLE NO 
CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE BY EITHER 
COACH I SHOULD THINK THE MESSAGE 
FROM BOTH CAMPS WOULD BE CARRY ON 
AS YOU ARE FOR LEEDS IT IS 
WORKING WELL FOR ARSENAL VIC 
AKERS IN HIS USUAL CALM WAY WE 
HAVE SAID KEEP GOING THE CHANCES 
WILL GO IN EVENTUALLY OF COURSE 
YOU HAVE JULIE FLEETING TAKING A 
SWIG OF WATER FIT AND READY TO 
TAKE HER PLACE ON THE FIELD WHEN 
NEEDED SHE HAS NOT PLAYED FOR 
ARSENAL SINCE THEY BEAT LEEDS FOUR TO ZERO 
IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE AT TADCASTER 
SHE HAS BEEN OUT WITH A BROKEN 
METATARSAL A BROKEN FOOT IN OLD 
MONEY BUT SHE WAS BACK IN ACTION 
AT THE WEEKEND PLAYING FOR 
SCOTLAND IN A EURO TWO THOUSAND NINE QUALIFIER 
AWAY TO PORTUGAL AND SCORED A HAT 
TRICK SHE IS BIT AGAIN FIT 
AGAIN FOUR YEARS AGO A DAY AFTER PLAYING 
FOR SCOTLAND AND SCORING FLEETING 
SINGLE HANDEDLY TOOK CHELTENHAM A 
PART IN AN F. A. CUP FINAL SCORING A 
HAT TRICK 
I WAS THERE SHE IS A HAT TRICK VERY GOOD PLAYER ARSENAL BRING QUALITY 
INTERNATIONALS ON 
THEY SEEM TO 
HAVE A NEVER ENDING SUPPLY JUST A 
QUICK WORD ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO WAS 
INELIGIBLE TODAY KIM LITTLE A SEVENTEEN 
YEAR OLD WHO JUST SIGNED TO ARSENAL 
TOO LATE FROM HIBERNIAN BUT SHE 
MAY BE THE BEST YET 
SHE IS AN 
EXCITING PROSPECT L. SAW HER IN 
MARCH YOU CAN SEE THE QUALITY 
ALREADY SHE HAS DONE WELL ON THE 
INTERNATIONAL STAGE FOR SCOTLAND 
SHE IS DEFINITELY ONE FOR THE 
FUTURE LEEDS ARE SPENDING CONSIDERABLE 
TIME IN THE ARSENAL HALF BUT THIS 
THROW IN HAS GONE TO THE GUNNERS I I THOUGHT ARSENAL WOULD COME OUT A 
BIT QUICKER THAN THIS L. WOULD HAVE 
THOUGHT THEY WOULD COME OUT QUICKER 
BUT THEY HAVEN'T EVEN ALEX SCOTT CAN'T KEEP THAT ONE 
IN THERE IS VIK AKERS HE LED THE 
TEAM TO SEVEN TROPHIES OVER THE 
LAST THREE SEASONS DURING THAT 
TIME ARSENE WENGER'S TEAM HASN'T 
WON A THING LEEDS UNITED GET A CORNER LEEDS ARE NOT GOING TO GET MANY 
CORNERS THEY JUST NEED TO GO FOR 
IT I SHOULD THINK THEY WILL WANT TO SWING THIS INTO THE PENALTY AREA KELLY SMITH LOOKED FOR KAREN CARNEY 
THE WHISTLE HAS GONE FOR FREE 
KICK TO ARSENAL THAT WILL BRING AN 
END TO THAT SPELL OF LEEDS 
ATTACKING 
WASN'T THAT HANDBALL ATTACKING SHE HAD A LONG TIME TO GET HER HAND 
OUT OF THE WAY I WILL LET YOU OFF I THINK CARLY TELFORD NEEDED TO BE 
MORE DOMINANT THERE YOU HAVE TO 
CONCENTRATE ALL THE TIME I THINK THE PACE OF THE SECOND HALF HAS BEEN DICTATED BY THE WEATHER A FAMILIAR PATTERN EMERGING AS ARSENAL PRESS I THINK THAT CAME OFF KAREN CARNEY 
IT IS INDEED A GOAL KICK TO LEEDS 
UNITED KAREN CARNEY WAS JUST A 
SUBSTITUTE LAST SEASON WHEN 
ARSENAL GOT RID OF CHARLTON PRETTY 
COMFORTABLY 
I THINK SHE WAS A COMFORTABLY SURPRISING SUBSTITUTE LIKE I SAID 
BEFORE ARSENAL HAVE AN 
EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES IN THEIR 
SQUAD VIC AKERS COULD PICK A GOOD 
ELEVEN WHOEVER HE USES IF SHE HAD LET THAT GO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A CORNER SUE SMITH BLASTS THE BALL IT IS 
GOING TO BE A FREE KICK FOR LEEDS 
HANDBALL 
THE REFEREE IS NOT REALLY HANDBALL DOMINANT THE REFEREE IN A GAME 
LIKE THIS SHOULD HAVE TO BE 
DOMINANT SHE IS BLOWING THE 
WHISTLE A BIT HALF HEARTEDLY THAT THAT IS SOMEBODY USED TO TROUBLING 
REFEREES DAVE WATSON FORMER 
ENGLAND CENTRE BACK AND A MEMBER OF 
THAT SUNDERLAND TEAM WE MENTIONED 
EARLIER THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY THEY 
BEAT LEEDS UNITED ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST SHOCKS IN F. A. CUP FINAL 
HISTORY ARE WE GOING TO GET A MAJOR SHOCK 
IN THE WOMEN'S F. A. CUP FINAL WITH 
LEEDS ON THE RIGHT END OF IT THIS 
TIME IT MIGHT ONLY TAKE ONE GOAL IT IS GOING TO BE A THROW IN THEY 
HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF FILES THAT 
HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF A YELLOW CARD 
I'M SURE BUT YOU HAVE TO CREDIT 
THE REFEREE FOR THAT A COUPLE OF 
FOULS 
BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE CONTROL FOULS OF THE GAME 
DON'T BE SO AND THE 
REFEREE ANTTI REFEREE DO YOU GET THE FEELING ARSENAL 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOLD BY VIK AKERS 
TO BE PATIENT THEY ARE NOT EXACTLY 
GUNG HO 
IT IS SO OBVIOUS THAT GUNG HO PERHAPS THAT IS WHAT HE HAS SAID L. 
THINK IF I WERE ARSENAL I WOULD 
GO FOR IT THINKING THAT AT SOME 
POINT THE RESISTANCE FROM LEEDS 
WOULD BREAK DOWN BUT YOU LOOK AT 
THE EVERTON GAME AND ARSENAL HAD 
THAT AT THE BACK OF THEIR MINDS AND 
THEY LOST ONE TO ZERO BECAUSE EVERTON DID 
A GOOD JOB ON THEM EMMA BYRNE WITH PLENTY OF TIME 
FAYE WHITE ABLE TO BRING THE BALL 
OUT SMITH ONE CHANCE THAT IS ALL 
KELLY SMITH NEEDS AND ARSENAL'S 
DOMINANCE IN THE GAME HAS FINALLY 
BEEN MADE TO COUNT IT HAD TO BE 
KELLY SMITH THE GOLDEN GOAL OF 
ENGLISH WOMEN'S FOOTBALL 
A GOOD 
RUN BY YANKEY CUTTING ACROSS 
WATCH KELLY'S MOVEMENT SHE 
DICTATED WHERE THE PASS WOULD GO 
IT JUST NEEDED A DEFT TOUCH WITH 
THEIR LEFT FOOT GOOD FINISH 
EXCELLENT FINISH 
A CLASSIC KELLY 
SMITH PIECE OF GOALSCORING SHE 
KNEW EXACTLY WHEN SHE WAS GOING TO 
STRIKE 
THERE IS NOT MUCH THAT STRIKE CARLY COULD HAVE DONE ABOUT THAT 
GOOD MOVEMENT GOOD FINISH KELLY KELLY SMITH SCORED TWO GOALS IN THE F. A. 
CUP FINAL LAST YEAR AS ARSENAL 
EASILY BEAT CHARLTON FOUR TO ONE THIS SO 
FAR HAS BEEN FAR FROM EASY FOR THE 
GUNNERS BUT NOW THEY HAVE THEIR 
LEAD NOW LEEDS HAVE TO COME OUT 
AND PLAY 
LEEDS HAVE GOT NOTHING TO 
LOSE THEY HAVE GOT TO GO FOR IT 
THEY WERE THE UNDERDOGS ALL THE WAY 
THROUGH AND 
BEHIND FOR AN 
ARSENAL GOAL KICK 
ONE THING LEEDS 
CANNOT DO IS LOSE FOCUS AND 
CONCENTRATION AND CONCEDE AGAIN 
QUICKLY THE CARS ARSENAL ARE 
RUTHLESS THEY WILL SCORE AS MANY 
GOALS AS YOU LET THEM SCORE 
NOT A 
FLICKER FROM VIK AKERS BUSINESS 
AS USUAL I THOUGHT AMANDA BARR STAYED ONSIDE 
BUT THE FLAG WENT UP 
I DO NOT KNOW 
WHETHER THAT WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE 
OF PASS BECAUSE JESS CLARKE WAS 
RUNNING THROUGH AS WELL L. DO NOT THINK SHE WAS OFFSIDE LIANNE SANDERSON ARE ARSENAL GOING 
TO GO ON AND STEAMROLLER LEEDS 
THAT WILL BE THE PLAN SANDERSON'S DAY WILL NOT BE 
COMPLETE WITHOUT GOAL WHAT IS IT 
ABOUT THESE BIG OCCASIONS THAT 
MAKES KELLY SMITH COME TO THE FORE 
TIME AND AGAIN WALTON DID NOT MAKE CONTACT WITH 
THE BALL PROPERLY RACHEL YANKEY 
SHOOTS BUT SHE CUTS ACROSS THE 
BALL AND SLICES WIDE GOOD GOOD DEFENDING SOMETHING LEEDS CANNOT 
DO IS MAKE MISTAKES AND GIVE THE 
BALL TO ARSENAL IN THOSE AREAS 
GOOD RUNNING GOOD MOVEMENT BY 
KELLY SMITH EXCELLENT DEFENDING I I AM SURE WE WILL TELL US ALL ABOUT 
THE BATTLING QUALITIES OF YOUR 
LEEDS COLLEAGUES IF ARSENAL WERE 
TO GO TWO TO ZERO UP IS THAT IT 
IN A 
SITUATION LIKE THIS IN A FILE THE 
GIRLS ARE DETERMINED TO GIVE NINETY 
MINUTES WHATEVER AND THEY WILL 
GIVE WHATEVER THEY WILL NOT GIVE 
UP UNTIL THE END THAT IS ONE THING 
YOU ARE GUARANTEED HOPEFULLY THEIR 
HEADS WILL NOT GO DOWN AND START TO 
CONCEDE ANY MORE 
SOMETHING ALONG 
THE PRESSURE OF THE ORIGINAL MATCH 
BALL A REPLACEMENT 
THE REFEREE 
HAS GOT THAT UNDER CONTROL ONE ONE THING CARLY TELFORD COULD HAVE DONE 
ABOUT THE KELLY SMITH GOAL THAT HAS 
GIVEN ARSENAL THE LEAD NOTHING 
FIRST HALF HEROICS FROM THE LEEDS 
GOALKEEPER BUT ARSENAL HAVE THE 
LEAD THAT THEY PRESSURE CERTAINLY 
WARRANTS LIKE I SAID IN THE FUR STAFF JUST 
CLARKE AMANDA BARR AND SUE SMITH 
IF THEY CAN JUST GET ON THE BALL 
AND GIVE SOME PRESSURE BUT IT IS 
EASIER SAID THAN DONE THEY HAVE TO 
HAVE THE PASS INTO THEM FIRST SANDERSON PUTS IT IN TOO HIGH FOR 
FAYE WHITE BUT IT IS CHARGED IN BY 
JAYNE LUDLOW ARSENAL ARE PULLING 
AWAY THEY ARE LOOKING TO WIN THE 
LEAGUE AND F. A. CUP DOUBLE FOR THEIR 
THIRD SUCCESSIVE SEASON VIK AKERS' 
TEAM LEAD BY TWO TO ZERO THEY ARE ALMOST 
THERE 
THE BALL TRAVELLED A LONG THERE WAY WITHOUT A DEFENDER GETTING A 
TOUCH ON IT AND JAYNE LUDLOW WAS 
SURPRISED THAT IT GOT TO HURT BUT 
A QUALITY TOUCH STRAIGHT THROUGH 
CARLY'S LEGS 
THIS TIME FAYE WHITE 
GOOD THAT GET ANYWHERE NEAR IT BUT 
A WELL TIMED RUN BY LUDLOW POKED 
OUT A GOOD GOT THE DECISIVE TOUCH 
I DO NOT THINK HE WOULD BE HAPPY 
WITH THAT DEFENSIVELY BUT LUDLOW 
DID EXACTLY WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO 
THERE IS GOING TO BE A LEEDS UNITED 
SUBSTITUTION IN THE IMMEDIATE 
AFTERMATH OF THAT GOAL IS THAT THE 
GOAL THAT FINALLY KILLS OFF HIS 
MOST DETERMINED OF EFFORTS FROM 
LEEDS JADE MOORE THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD 
MIDFIELDER IS MAKING WAY AND 
COMING ON HIS FELLOW SEVENTY YEAR OLD 
MEL SUTCLIFFE WHO HAS PROGRESSED 
THROUGH THE ACADEMY SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD 
SHE CAME ON IN THE LEAGUE CUP FINAL 
AGAINST ARSENAL LAST YEAR SHE WILL 
BE EIGHTEEN IN TWO WEEKS' TIME 
SHE HAS 
GONE TO RIGHT BACK HALL AND MOVING 
INTO THE MIDDLE THAT IS WHERE STEP 
IS USED TO PLAYING BUT AT 
INTERNATIONAL SHE IS A FULL BACK 
ASH STEPH SANDERSON'S SHOT IS THROUGH ARSENAL ARE RUNNING RIOT NOW WAS THE GAME REALLY GOING TO GO FAR 
WITHOUT LIANNE SANDERSON GOAL NOT A CHANCE IT IS THE FIFTY FIRST TIME THAT SHE HAS 
NETTED THIS SEASON ELEVEN OF THOSE IN 
THE F. A. CUP IT IS ARSENAL'S CUP NOW 
THAT GOT A LITTLE BIT OF DEFLECTION 
AND BACKSPIN AND SPUN OVER THE TOP 
OF CARLY TELFORD THEY ALL COUNT 
SHE NEVER NEEDS A SECOND INVITATION 
TO SHOOT DOES SHE 
THAT IS WHY SHE 
HAS SCORED THAT MANY GOALS GUYS 
THREE TIMES AN F. A. CUP WERE NOW 
MAKE THAT FOUR ARSENAL THREE LEEDS UNITED ZERO THERE IS 
SURELY NO WAY BACK FOR LEEDS FROM 
HERE 
IT IS GOOD FOR THE GAME AND HERE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT LEEDS DO NOT 
FALL APART COMPLETELY NOW BECAUSE 
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT WITH THE CROWD 
WHEN YOU'RE UNDER DOGS AND THE 
START CONCEDING GOALS QUICKLY 
EXPERIENCED PLAYERS LIKE SUE SMITH 
NEED TO GET ON THE BALL AND FLAG FLAG UP AGAINST KATY HOLFORD PEOPLE PEOPLE NEED TO STAY ONSIDE 
IT WILL FEEL 
THAT MUCH HOT OUT THERE NOW AS WELL 
WORLD CARLY TELFORD FIRST HALF 
HEROICS PLAYER OF THE GAME BY A 
COUNTRY MILE NOTHING SHE COULD 
HAVE DONE ABOUT ANY OF THE GOALS 
THAT ARSENAL HAVE PUT PAST HAS 
SINCE HALF TIME AND IT IS CRUEL ON 
LEEDS THAT ARSENAL'S THREE GOAL 
SHOULD HAVE COME AFTER AN OPENING 
TO THE SECOND HALF IN WHICH LEEDS 
LOOKS LIKE THEY MIGHT POSE A 
GREATER ATTACKING THEFT 
LIKE YOU 
SAY TWENTY SIX TO ONE THREE GOALS MAYBE LEEDS 
COULD TRY AND PUSH FORWARD NOW BUT 
THREE GOALS IS QUITE A DEFICIT 
PARTICULARLY A GAINSAY SIDE AS GOOD 
AS THIS 
ARSENAL HAVE NEVER LOST AN 
F. A. CUP FINAL AND THIS IS THE NINTH 
TIME THEY HAVE BEEN AND ONE THEY 
HOLD A JOINT RECORD WITH 
SOUTHAMPTON THEY WERE THE FIRST 
EVER WINNERS AT THE START OF THE 
NINETEEN SEVENTIES BUT ARSENAL THROUGHOUT THE 
NINETIES AND MORE RECENTLY HAVE BEEN THE 
BEST TEAM IN ENGLISH WOMEN'S 
FOOTBALL THEY ARE SHOWING IT AGAIN 
RICK PASSMORE IS CALLING FOR THE 
EFFORTS TO CONTINUE RIGHT UNTIL THE 
LAST TO GET DOWN FIELD AND GET A 
GOAL 
THIS IS WHERE THE LEEDS GOAL PLAYERS WILL LEARN ABOUT THEMSELVES 
AND MAINTAINING CONCENTRATION AND 
NOT JUST GIVING UP BECAUSE THAT IS 
THE EASIEST THING TO DO THE 
HARDEST THING TO DO IS FIGHT UNTIL 
THE END IN THIS GAME 
THE LAST 
SEVEN MEETINGS OF THESE TWO TEAMS 
ARSENAL HAVE WON ALL OF THEM 
SCORING THIRTY TWO GOALS IN THE PROCESS I I SCORED ONE OF THEM YEAH MEMORABLY 
YEAH MEMORABLY TWO YEARS AGO YOU TOLD ME NOT TO 
MENTION THAT 
I KNEW AT SOME POINT 
IT WOULD COME OUT 
IT IS IN MY 
NOTES SMITH LUDLOW SANDERSON THREE TO ZERO ARSENAL YOU EXPECT THE PACE OF THE GAME TO 
DEATH AS THE CLOCK TICKS ROUND 
BECAUSE IT IS ONLY GETTING WARMER TOO CLOSE TO JESS WRIGHT WHO HAS 
THE BALL OUT OF PLAY THAT 
DEMONSTRATED QUITE A BIT OF 
FRUSTRATION AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN 
THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES 
AS CAPTAIN 
CHESS LOVES TO DRIVE THE BALL 
FORWARD AND HAVE CONTROL FROM THE 
BACK SHE WILL BE DISAPPOINTED THAT 
THEY CONCEDED QUICKLY LIKE THAT NOT EASILY PASSED COLE THEN AND ARSENAL CORNER CULVIN THIS RECORD BREAKING ARSENAL SIDE MARCHES ON KEPT IN PLAY AND PUT ONTO THE TOP 
OF THE NET BY JAYNE LUDLOW CARLY CARLY GOT A TOUCH TO THAT AS IT CAME OVER 
BUT SHE WAS UNDER PRESSURE FROM BIG 
PLAYERS LIKE FAYE WHITE HE WAS 
TALLER THAN CARLY SO SHE HAS GOT 
TO REACH ACROSS THE TOP OF VERVE 
THE TOP OF HER 
JUST GOT THE RIGHT 
GLOVE TO IT JAYNE LUDLOW FOLLOWING 
UP LIANNE SANDERSON WE TOUCHED 
AND IS IN THE FIRST HALF SHE HAS 
TAKEN A GOALSCORING TOTAL FOR THE 
SEASON TO TWENTY AND THAT IS FROM A 
CITY MIDFIELD ROLE THAT SUMS UP 
WHAT ARSENAL ARE ABOUT 
LIKE I SAID 
BEFORE LUDLOW CAN GET ABOUT THE 
PITCH SO SHE CAN DEFEND AS A 
SITTING MIDFIELDER BUT GET ON THE 
END OF THE TAX AND SHE FINISH AS 
WELL SHE IS ATHLETIC ARSENAL 
SCORE LOADS AND LOADS OF GOALS YOU 
WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU DID 
NOT GET ABOVE FIFTEEN IN THEIR TEAM 
THERE ARE SIX PLAYERS IN THAT TEAM 
WHO HAVE GOT TO DOUBLE FIGURES THIS 
SEASON LEEDS UNITED'S TOP SCORER AMANDA 
BARR HAS GOT NINE AS SHE 
I THINK 
THAT IS JUST IN THE LEAGUE SHE 
WILL HAVE A FEW MORE 
SHE HAS HAD 
THE BALL IN THE BACK OF THE NET 
TODAY OF COURSE BUT SHE HAD 
ALREADY 
BEEN FLAGGED OFFSIDE WHAT A DIFFERENT GAME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THE FLAG HAD STAYED DOWN CLEARED COMPREHENSIBLY BY BRADLEY A CHANCE TO CROSS IT DRIFTS 
HARMLESSLY BEHIND THE GOAL THE THE PACE OF THE GAME LIKE I SAID IS 
DICTATED BY THE HEAT ON THE PITCH 
IT IS THE FIRST DAY WE HAVE AT THIS 
YEAR OF WARMTH AND I THINK THE 
GIRLS WILL NOT BE USED TO THAT SO 
THAT IS WHY THE PACE IS LIKE THAT 
VIK IS NOT HAPPY RICK IS NOT 
HAPPY 
LAST SEASON WE GOT A RECORD HAPPY CROWD IN THE HISTORY OF THE WOMEN'S 
F. A. CUP FINAL AND I AM PLEASED TO 
ANNOUNCE THAT THERE ARE FIFTY THREE MORE 
INSIDE THE CITY GROUND TODAY 
TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO ENJOY IN THE EARLY MAY 
SUNSHINE I DO NOT THINK ANYONE AS 
LEFT GET EITHER LEEDS UNITED FANS 
STAYING UNTIL THE END TO SEE IF 
THEIR FANS CAN SCORE AGAINST HIS 
ALL CONQUERING LINE UP 
OF COURSE 
THEY ARE LEEDS FANS AFTER ALL MARY PHILLIP ABOUT TO CELEBRATE 
HER FIFTH F. A. CUP TRIUMPH SHE 
ACTUALLY LOST THE FINAL ONCE 
WHILST WITH FULHAM PERISH THE 
THOUGHT WELL WIDE FROM MEL SUTCLIFFE I 
THINK SHE REALISED WHERE SHE WAS 
AND COULDN'T QUITE GET THE SHOT OFF 
PROPERLY WE HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH OF EMMA BYRNE TODAY HAVE WE THE MOST UNDER EMPLOYED GOALKEEPER AT ANY LEVEL OF FOOTBALL ANYWHERE I WILL VOUCH FOR HER SHE MIGHT BE A FAKE SHE NEVER HAS 
ANYTHING TO DO SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE 
THERE LEEDS UNITED HAVE A GOAL 
SURELY IT IS TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR IT 
TO BE WAY BACK BUT THERE IS HOPE 
FOR LEEDS 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS IN 
OFF THE BAR JESS CLARKE FOLLOWING 
UP GOOD PLAY BY SUE SMITH SHE GOT 
HOLD OF IT KEEPER BEATEN GOOD HEADER YOU 
COULD HEAR THE LEEDS FANS THAT IS 
GOOD TO HEAR 
A TREMENDOUS SHOT BY 
SUE SMITH EMMA BYRNE WAS BEATEN 
SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE CHANCE JESS 
CLARKE DID WHAT EVERY GOOD FORWARD 
SHOULD DO FOLLOW UP AND SCORE 
THAT WAS DIFFICULT FINISH FOR 
JESS CLARKE AND SHE DID WELL HAPPY HAPPY NINETEENTH BIRTHDAY 
I AM REALLY PLEASED 
FOR CHESS TOP QUALITY STRIKE 
FOR JEFFERS JESS ANOTHER GOOD CHANCE FOR ARSENAL 
BUT KELLY SMITH MISSED A SITTER 
FOR HER 
GOOD BUILD UP PLAY BY 
ARSENAL A GOOD BALL IN SHE JUST COULDN'T GET THE RIGHT 
AMOUNT OF PRESSURE ON TO THE BALL 
AND WIDE THE REACTION FROM THE LEEDS UNITED 
BENCH WAS NOT THE HANDSHAKE AND A 
SMILE IT WAS WE ARE BACK IN THIS 
WHY NOT YOU HAVE TO GO FOR IT 
THAT IS WHAT LEEDS WILL DO THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT BLOCK MADE 
BY SOPHIE BRADLEY 
EXCELLENT PLAY 
AGAIN BY SOPHIE BRADLEY SHE TENDS 
TO FIND HERSELF IN THE RIGHT PLACE 
AT THE RIGHT TIME THAT IS QUALITY KAREN CARNEY TO TAKE IT IT HAS BEEN A GRIPPING F. A. WOMEN'S 
CUP FINAL ANOTHER CHANCE AND OFF 
THE LINE AMANDA BARR LEEDS'S 
GOALSCORER IN CHIEF BECOMES GOAL 
SCARE ARE GOAL SAVER A GOOD HEADER THAT JAYNE LUDLOW THIS TIME IT IS OVER THE BAR YOU 
TRY AND PICK UP ARSENAL'S BEST 
HEADERS FROM THE BALL AND THERE 
ARE TOO MANY YOU LOOK AT THE SIZE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TEAMS AND 
YOU JUST HAVE TO TRY YOUR BEST TO 
GET IN THE WAY 
LAST YEAR I 
DISCOVERED JAYNE LUDLOW WAS A 
BRITISH UNDER SEVENTEEN TROUBLE JOB RECORD 
HOLDER TRIPLE JUMP RECORD HOLDER JAYNE LUDLOW SCORES A LOT OF GOALS FROM SET PIECES AS DOES FAYE WHITE AMANDA BARR WAS OFFSIDE SHE 
MANAGED TO GET HERSELF IN FRONT OF 
FAYE WHITE BUT TOO SOON 
SHE WAS 
DEFINITELY OFFSIDE IT IS WHEN THE BALL IS PLAYED 
ISN'T IT SHE LOOKED IN LINE AT 
LEAST THREE ARSENAL CHANGES IS 
THAT A MEASURE OF RENEWED THREAT 
FROM LEEDS UNITED LIANNE SANDERSON 
IS COMING OFF THAT IS A SURPRISE 
NOT A BAD REPLACEMENT IN JULIE 
FLEETING SOMEBODY JUST AS PROLIFIC 
LIANNE SANDERSON HAS BEEN KILLED 
SHE WENT HOME FROM THE ENGLAND CAMP 
DURING THE WEEK BECAUSE SHE WAS ILL 
LIANNE SANDERSON HAS BEEN ILL 
OFF COMES YANKEY TO BE REPLACED BY 
GEMMA DAVISON TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD CHEKHOV 
BACK UP STRIKER YVONNE TRACY IS 
COMING ON WHO IS GOING OFF HIS CIARA GRANT GOING OFF MARY PHILLIP THOUGHT IT WAS HER A JOSIE MARINO ESQUE CHANGE MADE 
THERE THREE OF THREE ON JOSE 
MOURINHO ESQUE LEEDS UNITED HAVE GIVEN THEMSELVES 
A PRAYER 
IT MAKES FOR A BETTER 
GAME OR IF THE CROWD ARE THINKING 
WHAT IF LEEDS GET ANOTHER ONE ON A HOT DAY OF COURSE IT MEANS ARSENAL HAVE SOME FRESH LEGS ON BELTED AWAY BY BRADLEY KAREN 
CARNEY TURNED ROUND AND FIRED 
FEROCIOUS VOLLEY TO THE FORCED 
OFFICIAL THE FIRST YELLOW CARD OF 
THE GAME IS CULVIN THE FOURTH 
OFFICIAL I DON'T THINK IT WAS AS BAD AS ALL 
THAT BUT IT WAS A YELLOW CARD 
KAREN CARNEY TURNED THE AIR AS BLUE 
AS THOUGH HIS LEEDS SHIRTS ASBOS 
LEEDS SHIRTS TURNED BEHIND FOR A 
CORNER TO ARSENAL AS THOSE LEEDS 
SHIRTS RICK PASSMOOR AND LEANNE HALL HAVE 
JUST BEEN IN CONTEMPLATION 
CONTEMPLATED ANOTHER LEEDS CHANGE 
THE FIRST THING IS TO KEEP THIS 
CORNER OUT CLARKE COULDN'T BEAT MARY PHILLIP 
MANY PLAYER HAS TRIED AT 
INTERNATIONAL LEVEL TO DO THAT AND 
FAILED THEY NEEDED TO GET THE BALL OVER MEL SUTCLIFFE IS A VERY QUICK 
PLAYER AND SHE IS MANAGING TO GET 
AWAY FROM DEFENDERS LEEDS APPEAL FOR A PENALTY ARSENAL GET IT AWAY BUT NOT CONVINCINGLY ALEX SCOTT WASTES THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO MAKE IT FOUR TO ONE 
THAT SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN A GOAL REALLY IT WAS ON THE 
PLATE NO PRESSURE BUT OVER THE 
TOP LEEDS ARE GOING TO PUSH 
FORWARD LEAVING GAPS BEHIND THEM 
IF YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO GET THE 
GOALS BACK THAT IS WHAT LEEDS PATH 
TO DO 
I WOULDN'T MIND BETTING WE 
WILL SEE AT LEAST ONE MORE GOAL 
WHAT LEEDS HAVE TO DO IF YOU HAD 
ASKED ME TEN MINUTES AGO I WOULD 
HAVE SAID FOR CERTAIN IT WOULD BE 
AN ARSENAL GOAL BUT NOW I AM NOT 
SO SURE 
THAT WAS AT EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD WHO BROKE INTO THE 
FIRST TEAM SQUAD LAST SEASON THE 
PITCH HAS AN UNWANTED VISITOR ON IT 
WE WILL NOT RUIN YOUR BANK HOLIDAY 
MONDAY LUNCH BY BOTHERING WITH THAT 
THAT IS HILARIOUS THAT IS FIRST 
IN WOMEN'S FOOTBALL 
RICK PASSMOOR 
ENJOYED IT ANYWAY I DIDN'T MIND IT APOLOGIES TO YOU AT HOME THERE IS AN EXCITED MURMUR AROUND THE GROUND NOW MEL SUTCLIFFE IS JUST ADDING A BIT 
OF EXTRA ENERGY TO THE LEEDS TIME 
A TEAM OLIVIA THACKRAY 
HAS COME ON SHE HAS DONE WELL SHE JUST COULDN'T 
GET THE CLEARANCE 
ANOTHER PLAYER 
WHO HAS BEEN CAPPED BY ENGLAND AT 
YOUTH LEVEL SHE IS ONLY EIGHTEEN THEY 
ARE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT AT THE 
COACHING LEVEL AT LEEDS BECAUSE 
THERE IS A PRODUCTION LINE OF 
PLAYERS COMING THROUGH ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY WE HAVE STILL GOT GIRLS COMING 
THROUGH QUITE A FEW OF THEM ARE ON 
THE PITCH SUE SMITH TRIED TO PUT A TELLING 
CROSS IN SHE GOT THE BETTER OF 
YVONNE TRACY BUT I THINK EMMA 
BYRNE KNEW WHERE THE BALL WAS 
HEADING 
WORTH AN EFFORT BUT I HEADING THINK SHE HAD IT COVERED THE 
KEEPER IS VERY TALL ANYWAY FOLLOWING UP TO SCORE KELLY SMITH 
HAS HER SECOND GOAL OF THE GAME 
ARSENAL HAVE WON IT ALL OVER AGAIN 
NO WAY BACK FOR LEEDS NOW AND THAT 
IS FOSTER 
JULIE FLEETING HAD A 
SIGHT ON GOAL THERE WAS NO WAY SHE 
WAS COMING TO PASS IT GOING TO 
PASS IT WASN'T QUITE ON TARGET BUT 
FOLLOWING UP UNFORTUNATELY FOR 
LEEDS AN ARSENAL PLAYER KELLY 
SMITH 
VIC AKERS ARSENAL LADIES SMITH SIDE THEY ARE BETWEEN TO WIN YET 
ANOTHER LEAGUE AND CUP DOUBLE 
THEY ARE GOING TO WIN THEY ARE 
HUNGRY FOR MORE GOALS IT IS GOING TO BE A CORNER THERE 
WAS A DEFLECTION AS SCOTT FIRED 
THEM 
I DO NOT KNOW WHO WOULD WAS THEM FROM I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
I'M NOT SURE THERE WAS ONE 
ACTUALLY 
WELL DONE REFEREE THIS ACTUALLY THIS ARSENAL TEAM AS WE SAW FLEETING 
HITS THE POST KELLY SMITH FOLLOWS 
UP IF ONE OF THE BIG NAMES DOES 
NOT GET YOU ONE OF FIVE OR SIX 
OTHERS WILL A THUMPING HEADER BUT IT IS WIDE 
FROM FLEETING LEEDS TOUCH ANOTHER 
CORNER KAREN CARNEY IS DOWN HAVING TAKEN 
THE CORNER JAYNE LUDLOW RUSHED 
ACROSS I THINK IT IS A TOUCH OF 
CRAMP FOR THE ENGLAND WINGER 
COLLAPSED IN A HEAP THE MOMENT SHE 
PUT THAT BALL INTO THE PENALTY AREA 
YEAH DEFINITELY CRAMP A GOOD 
CONNECTION JUST CHECKING THAT 
THE ASSISTANT REFEREE DID NOT PUT 
THE STUDS DOWN THE BACK OF THE NET 
NOT AS EXCITING AS THE UNWANTED 
VISITOR 
KAREN CARNEY LEAVES THE VISITOR FIELD FOR A FEW MOMENTS TO GET 
TREATMENT ARSENAL HAVE USED ALL 
THE SUBSTITUTES MEANWHILE ANOTHER 
CORNER KELLY SMITH THIS TIME IT 
IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER CORNER KELLY SMITH WILL TAKE IT AGAIN TWO 
GOALS AND LAST YEAR'S CUP FINAL 
TWO GOALS AGAIN THIS YEAR NOT AT RATHER HOPEFULLY TOWARDS THE 
BACK POST BY FAYE WHITE BUT IT IS 
WIDE A LEEDS GOAL KICK FIVE 
MINUTES TO GO AND ANOTHER LEEDS 
CHANGED TO TAKE PLACE JESS WRIGHT HAS LOOKED AS THOUGH 
SHE WAS FEELING THE HEAT FOR THE 
LAST FIVE OR TEN MINUTES SO THE 
CAPTAIN IS GOING TO MAKE WAY AT 
HAND OVER THE ARMBAND TOO GEMMA 
BONNER IS COMING ON OFF GOES JESS 
WRIGHT GEMMA BONNER ONLY SIXTEEN YEARS 
OLD 
YEAH JESS WILL BE OLD DISAPPOINTED TO BE TAKEN OFF BUT 
THAT IS HOW O'SHEA'S GEMMA BONNER 
GETS AN OPPORTUNITY AT SIXTEEN CAPTAIN CAPTAIN OF THE ENGLAND UNDER SEVENTEEN S. ON AT 
THE TAIL END OF A CUP FINAL LATE 
ON THE I'M SURE SHE WILL BE PART OF 
THE UNDER SEVENTEEN SQUAD PLAYING THE 
WOMEN'S WORLD CUP IN NEW ZEALAND 
THE TRIP OF A LIFETIME TELFORD PREVENT THE CORNER GOOD 
DEFENDING LEEDS ARE PUSHING 
FORWARDS AND ON HOT DAY LIKE 
THIS IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET BACK 
IT IS EASIER FOR ARSENAL TO GET 
FORWARD IT IS JUST PULLED WIDE NO FIFTH GOAL YET NOT A BAD EFFORT FROM DAVISON A GOAL KICK FOR CARLY TELFORD TO TAKE ARSENAL CAN TEND TO KEEP POSSESSION 
CONTENT AS I SAY THAT THEY 
MIGHT WANT ANOTHER GOAL TO WHILST 
REMAINING BARS I HOPE LEEDS DO NOT 
CONCEDE ANOTHER ONE BALANCED 
CHARLTON LAST FOUR TO ONE HERE A 
YEAR AGO AND THIS GAME HAS BEEN 
NOTHING LIKE AS ONE SIDED AS THAT 
ONE WAS YES ARSENAL HAVE BEEN DOMINANT 
BUT LEEDS HAVE GIVEN A BIT MORE OF 
A SCRAP VIK AKERS IS PREPARING TO 
CELEBRATE HIS TWENTY NINTH MAJOR TROPHY 
WITH THIS ARSENAL LADIES TEAM EACH 
ONE HAS BEEN AS KIELY CELEBRATED AS 
A LAST THE QUADRUPLE LAST SEASON 
THE DOUBLE IN THIS DISAPPOINTING 
SEASON SUE SMITH WITH A CHANCE PERHAPS IT WILL NOT REACH JESS CLARKE SHE CANNOT GET PAST KELLY SMITH 
WOULD YOU BELIEVE THE FURTHEST 
PLAYER BACK FOR ARSENAL 
I DO NOT 
DUE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS 
DOING THERE PERHAPS HAVING A REST WE ARE GETTING TO THAT TIME WHEN 
YOU HAVE GOT TO NAME PLAYER OF THE 
MATCH HE WAS IT GOING TO ARSENAL ARSENAL HAVE BEEN DOMINANT AND A FEW 
PLAYERS HAVE STOOD OUT FOR ME 
KELLY SMITH ETCETERA BUT IF IT HAD 
NOT BEEN FOR CARLY TELFORD IN THE 
LEEDS GOAL HIS CUP FINAL WOULD 
HAVE BEEN A LOT DIFFERENT AND SO 
FOR ME IT IS CARLY JUST FOR THE 
QUALITY SHE HAS DISPLAYED 
THROUGHOUT THE GAME 
I THINK THAT 
IS A PRETTY GOOD CALL ARSENAL FANS 
WILL BE HAILING KELLY SMITH BUT 
SHE HAS GOT MORE AWARDS THAN I HAVE 
HAD HOT DINNERS 
NOW O'SHEA HAS 
NOT 
SHE HAS GOT TWO GOALS NOTHING NOT NOTHING AGAINST GELI THAT WAS AGAINST YOU 
GUY 
SHE HAS SCORED GOALS THAT GUY HAVE HELD ARSENAL TO THE F. A. CUP YET 
AGAIN AND ARSENAL WILL BE HAILING 
HER YET AGAIN WE ARE BIASED 
TOWARDS ENGLAND BUT I THING SHE IS 
THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD 
BIRGIT PRINCE CAN ARGUE WITH ME 
LATER 
I THINK BECAUSE RIGHT SHE LATER IS ABSOLUTE QUALITY SHE HAS SHOWN 
THAT TODAY THAT IS 
GOING 
TO BE A FREE KICK FOR 
LEEDS UNITED WE HAVE ALREADY 
PLAYED OVER ONE MINUTE OF THE THREE 
ADDITIONAL TWO GOALS FOR KELLY 
SMITH ONE FOR JAYNE LUDLOW ONE 
FOR LIANNE SANDERSON OF ONE FOR 
RICK PASSMORE'S LEEDS UNITED SUE 
SMITH HITTING THEIR BARK JESS 
CLARKE FOLLOWING UP TO SCORE ON HER 
NINETEENTH BIRTHDAY THAT GAVE LEEDS JUST 
A GLIMMER OF HOPE BUT IT WAS 
ALWAYS LIKELY THAT ARSENAL WERE 
GOING TO GET IN FOR ONE OR TWO MORE 
CHANCES 
ARSENAL ARE VERY DOMINANT CHANCES IN THIS LEAGUE EVERTON AND LEEDS 
WERE TRYING TO CATCH THEM AND WILL 
HOPEFULLY DO SO IN THE NEXT FEW 
YEARS BECAUSE WE NEED THE LEAGUE 
TO BE MORE COMPETITIVE AT MAKE 
PEOPLE WANT TO WATCH MORE BUT YOU 
CANNOT TAKE IT AWAY FROM ARSENAL 
CAN THEY CHANGE WITH THE BACKING 
FROM THE MEN'S FOOTBALL CLUB THAT 
ARE STUCK GET CAN ANYONE GET TO 
THEIR LEVEL 
DEFINITELY THERE ARE 
QUALITY PLAYERS COMING THROUGH AT 
EVERY SINGLE CLUB EVERTON HAVE 
SHOWN THEY ARE NOT INVINCIBLE AND 
THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT 
IT IS 
GOING TO BE AN ARSENAL DAY AGAIN 
TODAY THEY ARE A WELL SUPPORTED WOMEN'S 
FOOTBALL TEAM L. MENTIONED THE 
LEEDS SUPPORTERS COMING UP BUT THEY 
OUGHT HAVE COME TO SUPPORT ARSENAL 
THEY LOVE WINNING AND WATCHING 
THEIR TEAM THEY ARE NOT USED TO 
ANYTHING ELSE THE LEEDS FANS ARE STILL THE BEST 
I HAVE TO SAY THAT 
THEY ARE STILL 
MAKING A LOT OF NOISE THE LAST SECONDS OF THE GAME 
PERHAPS THERE WILL BE A FIFTH 
ARSENAL GAME TELFORD HOLD ON 
PLAYER OF THE MATCH IT MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN ALL OVER BY HALF TIME BUT FOR 
LUCY'S CHOICE CARLY TELFORD IT IT WOULD BE DISAPPOINTING IF LEEDS 
CONCEDED AGAIN BECAUSE THIS IS NOT 
THE GAME IT WAS A COUPLE OF YEARS 
AGO AND THE GAME IT WAS LAST YEAR 
AS WELL 
CARLY TELFORD HAS DONE HER 
ENGLAND HOPES NO HARM AT ALL ONLY 
TWENTY YEARS OLD SHE HAS THE ADVANTAGE 
ON RACHEL BROWN AND SIOBHAN 
CHAMBERLAIN JAZZ AND A SUPER AGAIN 
TODAY BUT SHE WILL ONLY TAKE A 
RUNNERS UP MEDAL FROM IT BECAUSE 
ARSENAL HAVE DONE IT AGAIN SHE 
HAS HAD A SUPER GAME TODAY VIK 
AKERS' TEAM CANNOT STOP WINNING 
FOOTBALL MATCHES TWO GOALS FOR 
KELLY SMITH ONE EACH FOR LIANNE 
SANDERSON AND JAYNE LUDLOW THAT IS 
WHY ARSENAL ARE SO DOMINANT RICK 
PASSMORE I'M SURE WILL BE SO 
PROUD OF THE WAY HIS PLAYERS HAVE 
TAKEN TO THEIR TASK TODAY AS ARE 
YOU LUCY BECAUSE WHAT DID YOU SAY 
TO ME JUST BEFORE KICK OFF L. JUST 
BUILD ON THE TEAM TO BE EMBARRASSED 
THEY HAVE GROWN FROM TWO YEARS AGO 
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN 
LEEDS HAVE DONE 
REALLY WELL IT WAS IMPORTANT THEY 
PUT ON A SHOW AND ARSENAL ARE SO 
DOMINANT THEY PUT ON A 
PROFESSIONAL PERFORMANCE TODAY AND 
BEAT LEEDS BUT LEEDS HAVE NOTHING 
TO BE ASHAMED OF FOR DEFINITE 
LET'S GET THE THOUGHTS OF THE GUYS 
BACK IN THE STUDIO WE WILL BE BACK 
IN A FEW MOMENTS TIME FOR THE 
PRESENTATION IT IS ARSENAL'S F. A. 
CUP YET AGAIN ARSENAL'S LEAGUE AND 
CUP DOUBLE YET AGAIN ARSENAL FOUR 
LEEDS UNITED ONE 
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED 
THE THOUGHTS OF MY STUDIO GUESTS 
ARE CONGRATULATIONS TO ARSENAL BUT 
LEEDS PLAYED THEIR PART 
IT LOOKED 
LIKE ARSENAL WERE GOING TO THEY 
DID NOT GET A GOAL INITIALLY BUT 
IT LOOKED LIKE IT COULD BE A ROUT 
IT HAS NOT ENDED UP LIKE THAT 
LEEDS CLARK IS BACK AFTER A COUPLE 
OF EARLY GOALS IN THE SECOND HALF 
THEY CAME BACK AND CAUSED A PROBLEM 
FOR THEM AND THEY HAD A BIT OF 
MOMENTUM GOING AND IT COULD HAVE 
WORKED A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY BUT 
ULTIMATELY ARSENAL PROVED THEIR 
DOMINANCE IN WINNING THE GAME IT IT WAS A REALLY GOOD SHOT AT JOB FROM 
THE LEEDS OR THE BEST PART OF AN 
HOUR BUT IT FELT LIKE THEY WERE 
DELAYING THE INEVITABLE 
THEY WERE 
JUST HANGING ON IN THE END WOULD 
THEY ARSENAL ARE RELENTLESS THEY 
PRESS AND PRESS AND BRASS THEY DO 
NOT LET UP AND ONCE THEY GOT ONE 
GOAL THEY WANTED TO GET MORE THEY 
ENDED UP SCORING FOUR 
NOT THE 
QUADRUPLE THIS SEASON WHICH IS 
WHAT THEY WON LAST SEASON BUT TAKE 
NOTHING AWAY FROM VIK AKERS' 
MANAGEMENT THEY ARE THE BEST TEAM 
IN THE COUNTRY 
WITHOUT A DOUBT 
ABSOLUTELY SUPERB ALL AREAS OF THE 
FIELD THEY ARE STRONG THEY GOT 
GOALS FROM EVERYWHERE THAT IS THE 
KEY YOU KEEP THEM OUT FOR SO LONG 
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY COME THROUGH 
LUCY WAS RIGHT TO CALL TELFORD 
PLAYER OF THE MATCH ARSENAL HAD FORTY 
ATTEMPTS AND THAT SHOWS THE 
DOMINANCE IN THEIR ATTACK BUT AT 
TELFORD IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE 
HER HEROICS WERE NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP 
ARE STILL AT BAY THREE OF THE 
ARSENAL GOALS THERE WAS JOINED US 
NOW KELLY SMITH LEEDS MEHDI TOUGH 
IT OUT IN THE FIRST OF RELIEVED TO 
GET THE BREAKTHROUGH 
WE ARE GLAD 
THE GOAL CAME EARLY IN THE SECOND 
HALF SO WE COULD CONTROL THE TEMPO 
OF THE GAME WE WERE FRUSTRATED IN 
THE FIRST HALF WE DID NOT TAKE OUR 
CHANCES BUT WE GOT THE GOAL IN THE 
END 
ENGLAND TEAM MATE CARLY END TELFORD WHAT A GAME SHE HAD 
PLAYER OF THE MATCH FOR ME

PIECES ANOTHER ONE TODAY 
I AM 
JUST GLAD TO GET ON THE SCORESHEET

HALF BECAUSE THE FIRST HALF WAS 
DISAPPOINTING PERSONALLY BECAUSE 
WE SHOULD BE FINISHING THINGS 
BETTER THAN THAT LEEDS WORKED HARD

IT'S GOING TO CELEBRATE BECAUSE 
FOR THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW WE

TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FANS L. THINK EVEN THE LEEDS 
SUPPORTERS WILL GO AWAY HAVING HAD 
A GOOD AFTERNOON 
ABSOLUTELY GAMES 
LIKE THIS ARE ABOUT PROMOTING THE 
WOMEN'S GAME THE CROWD TURNED OUT 
AND ENJOYED IT THAT IS MOVING 
WOMEN'S FOOTBALL ONWARDS AND 
UPWARDS 
SOMETHING STRANGE HAPPENED UPWARDS THIS SEASON ARSENAL LEAD TO A CUP 
FINAL AND LOST ONE TO ZERO TO EVERTON IN 
FEBRUARY IN THE LEAGUE CUP FINAL 
BUT BUSINESS AS USUAL TODAY 
BEATING LEEDS FOUR TO ONE IT COULD HAVE 
BEEN MORE BUT FOR CARLY TELFORD 
THE LEEDS KEEPER 
YOU WERE PHENOMENAL IN THE FIRST 
HALF 
THAT IS WHAT I AM THEREFORE HALF TO KEEP THE BALL OUT OF THE NET L. 
TRIED MY HARDEST WE TRIED TO GIVE 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT TO STOP THAT IS ALL YOU CAN 
ASK THERE WERE SOME FLUKEY GOALS 
AND GOOD GOALS 
YOU HAVE TO BE 
PROUD OF YOUR PERFORMANCE YOU MUST 
BE PROUD OF IT 
I AM THERE TO DO A 
JOB CLEAN SHEETS IN THE FIRST HALF 
I WOULD HAVE LIKED A CLEAN SHEET IN 
THE SECOND HALF BUT YOU CAN'T DO 
EVERYTHING WELL DONE TO THE GIRLS 
GREAT FOR YOUR INCOME CHANCES 
DEFINITELY I AM ALWAYS TRYING TO 
IMPRESS ENGLAND CHANCES THAT 
WILL BE A GOOD FIRST HALF BUT I 
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE SECOND HALF 
YOU ARE TEAM OF YOUNGSTERS THIS 
IS THE TEAM FOR THE FUTURE THIS 
PERFORMANCE WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING 
TO BUILD ON 
DEFINITELY SUE IS THE 
OLDEST TWENTY EIGHT THE YOUNGEST IS SIXTEEN THE 
MIDDLE AGE IS ABOUT TWENTY WE ARE 
REALLY YOUNG SIDE WHAT MORE COULD 
WE ASK FOR IT IS JUST UNFORTUNATE 
WE DIDN'T WIN 
WELL DESERVED PLAYER OF THE MATCH 
A VALIANT DISPLAY BY HER BUT I 
SUPPOSE IT IS ARSENAL'S 
RUTHLESSNESS 
THAT SAID EVERYTHING RUTHLESSNESS ABOUT THEM THEIR GOAL POWER AND 
QUALITY KELLY SMITH WAS EXCELLENT 
IN THE SECOND HALF IT TOOK A GOAL 
FROM HER TO OPEN IT UP WHAT ABOUT THE RUN FROM SMITH SHE 
TIMED IT TO PERFECTION STAYED 
ONSIDE YOU CAN ARGUE ABOUT THE 
DEFENDING BUT FROM KELLY SMITH'S 
POINT OF VIEW YANKEY DOES WELL 
SMITH HOLDS A RUN AND SHE WATCHES 
THE BALL ALL THE WAY SHE 
CONCENTRATES ON MAKING GOOD CONTACT 
GUY MOWBRAY WAS ASKING WHY LIANNE 
SANDERSON TAKES THE FREE KICK HE 
IS THE ANSWER 
SHE IS GREAT AT SET 
PIECES SHE DOESN'T JUST HOLD UP 
THE BALL AND SCORES WELL SHE SETS 
UP PLAYED REALLY WELL 
YOU DON'T 
WANT TO SCORE FIFTEEN GOALS IN A SEASON 
AND NOT IN A CUP FINAL DO YOU 
ABSOLUTELY SHE WOULDN'T MISS A 
CHANCE LIKE THAT GREAT STRIKE 
PROBABLY A DEFLECTION GOOD TOUCH 
OUT OF HER FEET SITS UP NICELY 
CORNER OF THE GOAL 
ALL THREE GOALS 
IN SIX MINUTES LEEDS DID A LOT TO 
COME BACK INTO IT 
IT SAYS A LOT 
ABOUT THEIR PERFORMANCE AND 
CHARACTER THAT WAS BRILLIANT FROM 
SUE SMITH L. THOUGHT IT WAS GOING 
IN AND THEN CLARKE FOLLOWED UP AT 
THIS STAGE YOU THOUGHT IF THEY 
COULD GET TO THE NEXT ONE QUICKLY 
WE HAVE GOT THE GAME ON BUT 
ARSENAL GO ON AND GET THE FOURTH GOAL 
KELLY SMITH ACTUALLY GETS IT TWO 
TOP QUALITY PLAYERS IN THIS MONTH 
FLEETING AND SMITH 
I WAS SAYING TO 
RACHEL I WOULD HAVE PASSED THAT 
BUT FLEETING IS ALWAYS GOING TO 
TAKE THAT CHANCE ON SHE WAS 
UNLUCKY TO TAKE TO HIT THE POST 
JULIE FLEETING HAS QUICK FEET GET 
ROUND THE DEFENDER HITS IT WITH 
THE OUTSIDE OF HER FOOT THE SPIN 
OF IT BRINGING IT BACK INTO PLAY 
LET'S GO BACK TO PITCH SIDE THE 
ARSENAL CAPTAIN FAYE WHITE IS 
WITH KAREN DAVIES ALONGSIDE SUE 
SMITH 
A FAYE CONGRATULATIONS 
IT IS A 
GREAT FEELING IT IS THE SEVENTH TIME 
BUT NINE FOR THE CLUB I THINK THAT 
IS A RECORD FOR ARSENAL REALLY 
PLEASED IT IS AN AMAZING OCCASION 
YOU DIDN'T HAVE IT OWN YOUR OR 
YOUR OWN WAY BUT DOMINANT PAID OFF 
IN THE END 
IN THE FIRST HALF SOME 
OF THE SHOT BUT A BIT WAYWARD AND 
CARLI MADE SOME GOOD SAVES WE SAID 
AT HALF TIME IF WE CAN KEEP THE 
PRESSURE GOING WE GOT A GOAL 
THEY GOT ANOTHER GOAL BACK SUE SUE SMITH WELL DONE SECOND HALF 
PERFORMANCE GREAT GOAL FOR JESS 
YES WE ARE JUST DISAPPOINTMENT 
DISAPPOINTED WE DEFENDED QUITE 
WELL BUT LIKE FAYE SAID AS SOON 
AS THEY SCORED ONE THE FLOODGATES 
ARE OPEN THE BEST TEAM WON ON THAT 
DAY WE BATTLED HARD THE GIRLS 
WORKED HARD JUST DISAPPOINTING 
BUT A GREAT EXPERIENCE FOR THE 
YOUNGSTERS TO COME TO THE STAGE 
LIKE THIS 
WITHOUT A DOUBT THE 
FANS WERE FANTASTIC ALL THE LEEDS 
FANS WHO TRAVELLED DOWN YOU PLAY 
FOOTBALL TO PLAY GAMES LIKE THIS 
FINGERS CROSSED WE WILL BE BACK 
NEXT YEAR HOPEFULLY WINNING IT 
ARE YOU EVER GOING TO RELINQUISH 
THIS TROPHY 
NO IT IS TO SPECIAL 
AN OCCASION WE KEEP WANTING TO WIN 
WE DIDN'T HAVE IT ALL AWAY WE LOST 
THE LEAGUE CUP BUT THIS IS THE ONE 
EVERYTHING EVERYONE WANTS WELL WELL DONE DONE THE ROMANTIC INSIDE ME WAS KEEN FOR 
SUE SMITH TO GET HER HANDS ON THE 
F. A. CUP WHAT A FANTASTIC DISPLAY 
FROM CARLY TELFORD 
SHE WAS REALLY 
AMAZING IN THE FIRST HALF SHE 
KEPT THE BELIEF ALIVE FOR THE TEAM 
TO GO OUT IN THE SECOND HALF SOME OF HER GOALKEEPING WAS 
OUTSTANDING SHE COVERS A LOT OF 
GROUND WHAT A GREAT REACTION SAVE 
THAT WAS FINGERTIP ON TO THE BALL 
OTHERWISE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN 
ENGLAND'S EURO QUALIFICATION 
CAMPAIGN GOES ON SHE HAS DONE HER 
CHANCES NO HARM AT ALL 
NOT AT ALL 
SHE IS A GREAT PERSON TO TRAIN WITH 
IF SHE PAUSED PUPILS OF DISPLAYS 
LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME TODAY SHE 
KEPT THEM IN THE GAME ON THE 
BIGGEST STAGE AT DOMESTIC LEVEL IN IN THE PROGRAMME ARSENAL HAVE A 
WHOLE SUMMER OF HOW GOOD WILL THEY 
BE NEXT SEASON 
EVERTON HAVE HAD A 
FEW GOALS A WAY AS WELL IT WILL BE

OUT THERE TODAY THAT THE OTHER 
THING ABOUT FROM ABOUT THEM IS

ARE VERY MUCH TOGETHER THERE IS 
SOMETHING GOOD DEVELOPING AMONGST 
THE LEEDS PLAYERS IT BODES WELL 
FOR THE FUTURE 
THREE GOALS IN SIX 
MINUTES FOR ARSENAL WHICH THEY DID 
MANAGE AGAINST EVERTON IN THE 
LEAGUE CUP WHAT DID YOU DO THAT 
LEEDS DIDN'T MANAGE 
WE STEMMED THE 
FLOW OF KELLY SMITH DRIVING FROM 
WHERE SHE WAS WE TRIED TO BLOCK 
THAT OUT WHERE AS A PINK LEEDS 
BACKED OFF WHEN LEE AND DID THAT

TRIED TO STEM THE FLOW OF THEIR 
FOOTBALL IT HITS YOU MORE CHANCE
