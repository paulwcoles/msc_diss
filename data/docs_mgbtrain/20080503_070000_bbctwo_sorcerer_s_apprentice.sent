TWO WEEKS AT MAGIC SCHOOL 
THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE WINNER 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE 
A LITTLE HELP HERE PEOPLE 
ON TODAY'S SHOW MAKEOVER MAGIC AS THE SORCEREES DANCE TO A NEW TUNE 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY 
NO 
BUT COULD IT BE THE UNDOING OF ONE OF THE GROUPS 
THEY HATED US THEY ALL HATED IT 
DEEP IN THE HEART OF THE ANCIENT ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE 
A MASTER MAGICIAN IS SEARCHING FOR AN APPRENTICE 
A BOY OR GIRL WHO CAN MASTER 
THE SECRETS THE ART AND HISTORY OF MAGIC 
A PROTEGE TO MAKE THE LIGHT OF MAGIC SHINE ETERNAL 
AT THE END OF LAST WEEK 
ALL THE SORCEREES STARED ELIMINATIO IN THE FACE 
I THINK I'M QUITE READY 
WHEN THEY PERFORMED IN FRONT OF THEIR FIRST LIVE AUDIENCE 
I THOUGHT MY PERFORMANCE WENT REALLY WELL I WANT TO STAY 
I DO WANT TO STAY 
TEN SURVIVED 
MEHMET SULIMAN 
GET IN THERE MY SON 
FOUR WERE SENT HOME 
GOODBYE SAFE JOURNEY 
THANK YOU 
FOR THE REMAINING SORCEREES SADNES SOON TURNED TO DETERMINATION 
IT'S GETTING REALLY COMPETITIVE 
WE WANT TO PRACTISE HARDER THAN WE DID 
EVERYONE WANTS TO WIN 
THE CHALLENGES SET BEFORE THEM ARE GREATER 
THAN WHAT WE WERE REQUIRING OF THEM PREVIOUSLY 
AT THE END OF THIS WEEK ONLY ONE OF THESE MAGICIANS CAN BE CROWNED 
THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE 
THE SORCEREES ARE UP BRIGHT AND EARLY AS USUAL 
THEY'RE OFF TO MORNING ASSEMBLY TO FIND OUT THE NEXT TYPE OF MAGIC 
ON THE SCHOOL TIMETABLE 
SORCEREES WELCOME 
TODAY'S GENRE IS ESCAPOLOGY 
THROUGHOUT THE AGES MAGICIANS HAVE ESCAPED FROM ALL SORTS OF 
STRANGE CONTRAPTIONS 
THIS IS A NINETEEN THIRTIES HAND SHACKLE 
THEY USED TO USE THESE IN NINETEEN THIRTIES PRISONS IN ENGLAND 
LET'S HAVE A VOLUNTEER 
MEGAN COME AND JOIN ME ON THE STAGE 
I WANT YOU TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE BAR 
IT'S A WELDED BAR I WANT YOU TO CHECK THAT BAR IS SOLID FABULOUS 
MEGAN'S JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THE SORCERER IS LOCKED IN SECURELY 
BEFORE HE ATTEMPTS HIS ESCAPE 
AND LEONIE IS INVITED ON STAGE TO DOUBLE CHECK THERE'S NO 
FUNNY BUSINESS 
I WANT YOU TO TUG AT AT MY ARMS MAKE SURE I'M IN THERE TIGHTLY YES 
YES O. K. YOU CAN BOTH HAVE A SEAT DO YOU NEED THE KEYS 
NO KEEP THE KEYS OR IT WOULDN'T BE MUCH OF AN ESCAPE WOULD IT 
SO THAT'S ON TIGHTLY AROUND MY HANDS VERY VERY TIGHTLY 
NOW I DID ACTUALLY TELL YOU A FIB 
I'M NOT ACTUALLY AN ESCAPOLOGIST UNFORTUNATELY 
HOWEVER I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO A MAN HE'S AN ESCAPOLOGIST TODAY 
HOLD ON A MOMENT THAT'S WHAT I CALL HANDS FREE 
PLEASE PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER FOR MY VERY GOOD FRIEND MR. DAVID PENN 
THANK YOU SORCERER 
GOOD MORNING SORCEREES 
THIS PIECE OF APPARATUS IS KNOWN AS THE VILLAGERS' REVENGE 
YEARS AGO IT WOULD STAND IN THE CENTRE OF A MARKET SQUARE AND 
IF SOMEONE COMMITTED A CRIME THEY WERE STRAPPED INTO IT 
AND PELTED WITH FRUIT 
TODAY MISS EVANS WILL BE HELPING DAVID PERFORM HIS TRICK 
WOULD YOU MIND STRAPPING ME IN TO THE VILLAGERS' REVENGE 
FIRST OF ALL GUYS THE FIRST STRAP GOES ON STRAPS MY NECK 
THE NEXT ONE STRAPS MY CHEST IN PLACE 
AND EACH ONE RESTRICTS MY MOVEMENT MORE AND MORE 
THE NEXT ONE GOES AROUND THE WRIST 
AND THE NEXT ONE AROUND THE KNEES 
FINALLY THE LAST ONE WILL GO AROUND THE ANKLES 
STRAPPING ME TO THE BOARD 
I LITERALLY CANNOT MOVE 
BUT TODAY AS A TEAM 
WITH THE HELP OF YOUR MENTORS YOU'LL BE LEARNING HOW ESCAPOLOGY 
CAN REALLY ENHANCE YOUR MAGIC 
THE SORCEREES NOW HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO PROTECT THEIR OWN ESCAPOLOGY TRICKS 
I DON'T HAVE A CLUE HOW THEY'RE GOING TO TEACH US 
TO ESCAPE FROM SOMETHING BUT I'M UP FOR THE CHALLENGE 
I'D LIKE TO ESCAPE FROM A STRAITJACKET 
I THINK IT'LL BE SOMETHING LIKE HANDCUFFS OR SOMETHING 
HANDCUFFS WOULD BE GOOD 
BUT THEN WHEN WE GET ARRESTED WE'D JUST GET OUT OF IT 
I'M AFRAID THERE ARE NO HANDCUFFS INVOLVED IN THIS TRICK MEHMET 
IF YOU CAN ALL SQUEEZE ON THAT BENCH THAT WOULD BE GREAT 
ESCAPOLOGY COMES IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES 
THE SORCEREES' TRICKS INVOLVE JUST TWO LENGTHS OF ROPE 
THAT'S THE FIRST PART WHERE I'M GOING TO TIE THE BODY TOGETHER 
I'LL HOLD ON TO THESE TWO ENDS AND THREAD THEM THROUGH THE JACKET 
IF YOU COULD TAKE THOSE AND PULL FANTASTIC 
DO EXACTLY THE SAME AT THIS END THOSE GO THROUGH 
TAKE THOSE O. K. WE'RE GOING TO DO A KNOT IN THE CENTRE AS WELL 
THAT'S FOR YOU TAKE THAT AND THAT IS FOR YOU TAKE THAT 
YOUR JOB LADIES IS 
ON THE COUNT OF THREE IS TO PULL AS HARD AS YOU CAN 
YOU READY THREE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE PULL PULL PULL KEEP GOING 
THAT'S HOW YOU CAN MAKE IT GO THROUGH YOUR BODY THROUGH YOUR 
JACKET AND OUT THE OTHER SIDE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
SO FAR THE SORCEREES HAVE BEEN SPLIT INTO BOYS' AND GIRLS' GROUPS 
TO STIR THINGS UP THEY'RE NOW DIVIDED INTO THREE MIXED TEAMS 
COME OVER HERE EVERYONE 
FROM BEING BOYS TO GIRLS 
WE'VE NOW MADE THEM WORK IN MUCH SMALLER TEAMS 
LEONIE HERE 
FRANKIE 
THAT'S A DIFFERENT DYNAMIC WHICH WILL CREATE TENSIONS 
FOR EACH TRICK OUR SORCEREES WILL BE TIED UP TO A DIFFERENT OBJECT 
LEONIE'S GROUP HAVE A JACKET 
THREE TWO ONE PULL YAY 
ELLIE'S CREW HAS A CHAIR 
LADIES PULL SEE WHAT HAPPENS THERE YOU GO 
IT GOES RIGHT THROUGH OUT THE OTHER SIDE THAT'S A REALLY COOL 
AND MEGAN'S GANG HAS A MEGAN 
YES WE HAVE SUCCESS 
AT THE HEART OF ALL THREE TRICKS IS ONE SIMPLE SECRET 
THE TWO ROPES ARE IN FACT LOOPED 
AND HELD TOGETHER WITH A PIECE OF COTTON THREAD 
THAT'S WHERE MY HAND IS 
IT MIGHT LOOK EASY BUT DON'T TRY IT AT HOME WITHOUT A PROFESSIONAL 
PLEASE DON'T HURT ME 
IT'S NOT SNAPPING 
IT'S NOT SNAPPING 
ONE TWO THREE 
CAREFUL NOT TOO TIGHT 
THERE WE WANT TO AVOID THAT 
HOLD ON STOP STOP STOP PULLING 
NOW PULL THERE WE GO 
GREAT ESCAPE 
TOP MAGICIAN DAVID PENN HAS COME TO WATCH AND OFFER HIS EXPERT ADVICE 
HOW ARE YOU DOING GUYS 
WE'RE DOING WELL 
THIS LOOKS ALL VERY EXCITING DON'T STOP KEEP GOING 
TWO THREE AND PULL 
WOW THAT LOOKS FANTASTIC 
MEGAN'S GROUPS SEEM TO HAVE IT SUSSED 
AS DO ELLIE'S 
IT'S REALLY FUNNY YOU'VE GOT THAT BIT LET'S TIE HIM UP 
AND YOU TRY AND SNEAK OFF 
THAT'S REALLY FUNNY 
BUT FOR LEONIE'S GANG IT'S NOT THE ESCAPOLOGY THAT IS 
TYING THEM UP IN KNOTS 
FRANKIE THERE'S IS A LOT BETTER THAN OURS 
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF ANYTHING THAT'S WHY 
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE AND GET REALLY BAD MARKS 
LEONIE YOU COMING UP WITH US OR NOT NO 
WE'LL JUST DO IT OURSELVES THEN 
SHE'S REFUSING TO WORK WITH US 
YOU'RE JUST CUTTING OFF YOUR NOSE TO SPITE YOUR FACE 
SEASONED CIRCUS GIRL LEONIE 
IS USED TO WORKING WITH A HIGHER CLASS OF PERFORMER 
I'M LEONIE GIBBS AND I GREW UP IN A CIRCUS 
MY WHOLE FAMILY WAS IN THE CIRCUS 
MY DAD WAS CIRCUS HIS DAD WAS CIRCUS MY GREAT GRANDDAD WAS CIRCUS 
IT GOES ON AND ON WHEN YOU'RE LIVING AT THE CIRCUS 
YOU SEE DIFFERENT PEOPLE PRACTISING THEIR ROUTINE AND DOING THEIR ACT 
YOU MEET PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE LIKE HUNGARY AND MONGOLIA 
SOME PEOPLE FROM AFRICA 
THEY COME AND SHOW WHAT THEY CAN DO AND WHAT THEY LIKE DOING BEST 
IT'S LIKE A TRAVELLING VILLAGE IN A WAY LIKE A BIG FAMILY 
BUT TODAY SHE HAS TO SETTLE FOR THIS PAIR OF CLOWNS 
YOU'RE BLAMING ME 
WE DIDN'T SAY YOUR NAME AT ALL 
YOU ARE YOU'RE BLAMING ME 
WE DIDN'T SAY YOU 
GUYS GUYS THIS IS NO GOOD YOU'RE MEANT TO BE WORKING AS A TEAM 
DO YOU NOT NEED ANY ADVICE THEN DO YOU WANT ME TO WATCH 
O. K. ARE YOU ACTUALLY PERFORMING NOW YEAH 
RIGHT I'VE GOT TO STOP YOU GUYS 
THE OTHER TEAMS AT THE MOMENT THEY SEEM A BIT AHEAD OF YOU 
LET'S HAVE MORE OF THE TEAM WORK 
IT SEEMS THAT TWO'S COMPANY BUT THREE'S A CROWD 
EVERYTHING WAS GOING GOOD AND THEN LEONE 
STARTED BOSSING US AROUND AND TELLING US TO DO THIS AND THIS 
AND WANTING TO BE THE CENTRE OF ATTENTION YES 
THERE'S TWO STRONG CHARACTERS LEONE AND MEHMET 
WHEN LEONIE TRIES TO TAKE CHARGE MEHMET DOESN'T LIKE IT 
FRANKIE IS GONNA BACK MEHMET UP SO THE BOYS ARE AGAINST THE GIRLS 
BUT WHEN YOU'RE WORKING IN A GROUP IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ONE PLAYER 
IT'S ABOUT EVERYONE IN THE GROUP 
YES 
IT'S LUNCHTIME LEONIE FRANKIE AND MEHMET'S ARGUMENT HAS SPREAD 
LEAVING A DARK CLOUD HANGING OVER THE ENTIRE SCHOOL 
THE SORCERER WANTS THEM TO MAKE UP 
QUITE LITERALLY 
LOOKING GOOD ON STAGE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO A MAGICIAN 
SO OUR SORCEREES HAVE BEEN ENROLLED IN A MAKE UP LESSON 
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING THE BOYS IN A MAKE UP LESSON 
THEY'RE NOT GONNA LIKE THAT 
THINK AGAIN 
A GLOSSY APPEARANCE COMPLEMENTS A GOOD PERFORMANCE 
WE WANT YOU LOOKING GOOD UNDER THE LIGHTS 
WE WANT YOU LOOKING GOOD IN FRONT OF YOUR AUDIENCE 
YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK HEALTHY 
THE SORCERER HAS INVITED MAKE UP ARTIST ARIANNE POOLE 
TO HELP THE TRAINEES INJECT SOME MUCH NEEDED GLAMOUR INTO THEIR ACTS 
I WORK WITH CELEBRITIES AND IF YOU THINK OF YOUR BIG FILM STARS 
LIKE YOUR JAMES BONDS 
THEY MAY NOT LOOK LIKE IT BUT EVEN THEY WEAR MAKE UP 
UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYE OF THE SORCERER 
IT IS TIME TO SLAP ON THE SLAP 
I LOOK ORANGE AND OTHER BEAUTY ESSENTIALS 
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE DOING THIS 
JUST BLEND IT ALL IN HOW'S THAT FEELING GOOD 
REALLY NICE 
THIS IS REALLY REALLY GOOD I LOVE DOING MAKE UP 
REBECCA'S IN HER ELEMENT BUT IT'S SHOCK FOR FELLOW SORCEREE ELLIE 
I DON'T USUALLY HAVE COLOUR ON MY FACE SO IT'S PRETTY STRANGE 
LET'S FACE IT PINK WOULDN'T NORMALLY BE ELLIE'S FIRST CHOICE 
I'M ELLIE COWGIE BUT YOU CAN CALL ME EMO CHILD 
ROCK ON EMO IS EMOTIONAL ROCKER 
EMOS WEAR BLACK EYELINER DIFFERENT COLOURS ON EACH FINGER BECAUSE JUST 
THE SAME COLOUR IS QUITE BORING 
I KNOW I'M NOT A GIRLY GIRL 
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN GIRLY GIRL MAKE UP 
LEAVE THOSE 
WELL YOU MIGHT THINK IT'S GIRLY BUT THE BOYS DON'T SEEM TO MIND 
I'VE GOT EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE JAMMED ON MY FACE 
MASCARA EYELINER BLUSHER 
OCCASIONALLY I'VE BEEN KNOWN TO WEAR A BIT OF MAKE UP 
BIT OF A FLUTTER HERE AND THERE 
I'M NOT SKILLED AT THIS 
IT'S A NATURAL TALENT 
AS MY MOTHER ALWAYS USED TO SAY TO ME 
KEEP YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL 
IT'S YOUR DUTY TO BE BEAUTIFUL 
KEEP YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL IF YOU WANT TO BE LOVED 
DON'T FAIL TO DO YOUR STUFF WITH A LOT OF POWDER AND A PUFF 
I THINK MEHMET LOOKS GOOD ACTUALLY MAYBE NOT THE MASCARA 
JOE IS TAKING IT TOO FAR HE'S A RIGHT POSER 
I LIKE TO POSE IN THE MIRROR WITH MY MAKE UP ON 
HE'S WEARING EYE SHADOW 
I'VE GOT SO MUCH ON I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU 
I HOPE TO SEE YOU UP ON A STAGE REAL SOON 
BYE 
IT'S PRACTICE TIME LEONIE FRANKIE AND MEHMET ARE STILL NOT TALKING 
AND NOW A NEW ROW HAS ERUPTED 
WAIT GIVE ME CHANCE 
GO BACK TO THAT BIT J. UST LEAVE IT 
NO ONE SAID TEAMWORK WAS EASY 
FROM THE START JOE SAVAGE HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE IS IN IT TO WIN IT 
BUT HIS COMPETITIVENESS HAS ALIENATED MEGAN 
WE'RE GONNA GO FOR THE 
YOU AND JOE ARE ARGUING YEAH 
HE'S GETTING ON MY NERVES I CAN'T WORK WITH HIM 
OF COURSE YOU CAN 
I THINK THE WAY IT WORKED TODAY WAS WONDERFUL 
TO BE IN WITH A CHANCE OF IMPRESSIN THE SORCERER 
JOE MUST SOMEHOW GET THE TEAM WORKING TOGETHER 
MEGAN AND ALEX ARE SAYING THAT I'M DOING 
TOO MUCH AND I'M GETTING TOO BOSSY 
IF THEY LOOK BAD THEN IT WILL BRING 
ME DOWN AND MAKE ME LOOK BAD 
I DON'T WANNA GET KICKED OUT COS OF SOMEONE ELSE 
IT'S A NEW DAY AT MAGIC SCHOOL 
BUT WILL IT BE A FRESH START FOR OU SQUABBLING PUPILS 
AS OUR SORCEREES ALREADY KNOW WITH MAGIC 
PRESENTATION AND TEAMWORK WITH YOUR ASSISTANT ARE VERY IMPORTANT 
YOU CAN GET HELP WITH THAT FROM THE MOST UNLIKELY OF PEOPLE 
TODAY I'VE INVITED A COUPLE OF MY VERY GOOD FRIENDS WHO HAVE CARVED 
OUT FOR THEMSELVES A VERY STRICTLY STRICT DISCIPLINE INDEED 
BRACE YOURSELVES 
FOR THE DAZZLING IAN WAITE 
AND THE DELECTABLE CAMILLA DALLERUP LIGHTS DOWN 
CAMILLA AND IAN OF STRICTLY COME DANCING FAME ARE HERE TO SHOW THE 
SORCEREES HOW TO COMMAND A STAGE AND DAZZLE THEIR AUDIENCE 
NOW DOES THAT LOOK LIKE SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE TO TRY 
NO 
IF THE BOYS PAIR UP WITH THE GIRLS IN THE FRONT AND JOIN US 
HAVING BEEN PROFESSIONAL DANCE PARTNERS FOR OVER THREE YEARS 
THIS PAIR KNOW ALL ABOUT TEAMWORK 
GREAT TO SEE YOU SO KEEN TO WORK IN PAIRS 
WE'LL TAKE YOU 
COME FORWARD A LITTLE BIT SO WE CAN SEE YOU 
OH DEAR LOOK WHO'S DANCING TOGETHER 
STEP TOGETHER ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT

I CAN'T WORK WITH HER 
SHE'S THE WRONG TEMPERATURE 
SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER 
WELL THEY SAY IT TAKES TWO TO TANG 
CHA CHA CHA STEP STEP 
AFTER A SHAKY START OUR COUPLES A. R. WORKING WELL TOGETHER 
ROLL HER OUT ROLL HERE IN 
AND ARE READY TO STRUT THEIR STUFF IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE CLASS 
O. K. LET'S CUE THE MUSIC PLEASE 
LATER THEY'LL HAVE TO INCORPORATE THESE MOVES 
INTO THEIR ESCAPOLOGY ROUTINE 
FOR NOW THEY'RE DANCING IN PERFECT HARMONY 
WELL ALMOST 
ZERO POINT TWO THREE FOUR ONE TWO THREE GOOD 
TURN 
CHA CHA CHA 
TURN CHA CHA CHA ROLL IN 
ROLL IN 
MY PARTNER WAS MEHMET 
HE EMBARRASSED ME SO MUCH 
SHE WENT YOU DONE IT WRONG AND IT WAS HER THAT WENT THE WRONG WAY 
I DID IT RIGHT SHE MESSED UP 
HE WAS GOING LEFT INSTEAD OF RIGHT 
AND HE WASN'T CONCENTRATING 
HE WAS TOO BUSY BEING STUPID 
THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO BE BEZZIE MATES BUT CAN THEY CALL A TRUCE 
FOR LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE IT THROUGH THEIR ESCAPOLOGY ROUTINE 
IT'S MORNING BREAK TIME AND THE SORCEREES SEEM TO HAVE CAUGHT 
SOME SERIOUS DANCE FEVER 
THEY ARE IN HIGH SPIRITS TODAY 
THE SUN IS SHINING AND THEY'VE BEEN DANCING 
AND WITH THE CLOCK COUNTING DOWN TO SHOWTIME THEY'VE 
FINALLY STARTED WORKING TOGETHER EVEN IF THERE IS NO MAGIC INVOLVED 
DON'T FALL DON'T FALL 
WHOA 
O. K. GRAB YOUR THINGS 
THERE'S JUST ENOUGH TIME TO PERFECT THEIR NEW IMAGE 
EVEN EMO ELLIE IS BRUSHING UP ON HER FRESHLY ACQUIRED MAKE UP SKILLS 
BUT TO CREATE HIS NEW HAIRY LOOK 
COMPETITIVE JOE'S ENTHUSIASM HAS CLEARLY GOT THE BETTER OF HIM 
ACID FREE NON TOXIC WATER RESISTANT 
BUT AT LEAST IT'S PHOTO ACTIVITY TESTED 
SO BASICALLY JOE YOU'VE JUST PUT PERMANENT MARKER ON YOUR FACE 
GOOD LUCK GETTING THAT OFF 
WE'VE NOT GOT MUCH TIME LEFT PEOPLE SO GET A MOVE ON 
PUT YOUR FINAL BITS OF MAKE UP ON 
IT'S TIME FOR THE NEXT PERFORMANCE AND ALSO A GOOD CHANCE FOR SORCEREES 
TO SHOW HOW MUCH THEY HAVE LEARNT ABOUT THEIR 
NEW MAGIC TECHNIQUE ESCAPOLOGY 
WITH THE COMPETITION NOW IN THE FINAL WEEK 
THERE'S MORE AT STAKE THAN EVER 
THE BAR'S BEEN RAISED SLIGHTLY THEY'VE GOT A LOT MORE WORK TO DO 
THEY'VE GOT TO BE MORE FOCUSED 
I THINK EVERYONE HERE AT THE MOMENT 
HAS A CHANCE OF BEING THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE 
I'M NERVOUS IN CASE I GET ANYTHING WRONG 
IN A MOMENT YOU WILL BE PERFORMING FOR US IT'S THE CULMINATION 
OF A LOT OF HARD WORK AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES 
SO CONSEQUENTIALLY WE HAVE DAVID IAN AND CAMILLA 
TO BE IN OUR AUDIENCE WATCHING AND HELPING COMMENT AND JUDGE 
YOUR PERFORMANCES THIS AFTERNOON 
FIRST TO PERFORM WITH THEIR 
COMEDY SLAPSTICK ROUTINE IS MEGAN A JOE'S GROUP 
COME ON MEGAN 
GET OFF ME 
DON'T DRAG ME 
BUT TO SUCCEED THEY MUST PUT THEIR DIFFERENCES BEHIND THEM 
SMILE 
SO WE GIVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE AS OUR FIRST GROUP PERFORMS FOR US 
THEIR ESCAPOLOGY ROUTINE 
VERY THEATRICAL SORCEREES 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IAN 
I REALLY LIKED YOU GUYS 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ENTERTAINING AND YOU GAVE ME COMEDY VALUE 
WELL DONE FOR COVERING ALL THOSE STEPS IN SUCH A SHORT TIME 
WHAT ABOUT YOU DAVID 
ESCAPOLOGY CAN BE BORING YOU MADE IT ENTERTAINING 
YOU TURNED YOUR BACK ON THE AUDIENCE AT ONE POINT 
KEEP THE FRONT OF YOUR BODY TOWARDS THE AUDIENCE WHEN TYING THE KNOTS 
YES I MUST SAY THAT WAS A VERY GOOD ACHIEVEMENT 
GIVE THEM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE 
AFTER THE SQUABBLES MEGAN JOE AND THE TEAM HAVE PULLED IT OFF JUST 
I THINK WE DID REALLY WORK WELL AS A TEAM 
YEAH TEAM 
MEANWHILE ALL THE OTHER WARRING GROUP CAN DO IS SIT TIGHT 
AS REBECCA ELLIE AND TOMOS TAKE TO THE STAGE FOR THEIR ROUTINE 
IN PRACTICE THIS LOT DIDN'T PUT A FOOT WRONG 
NICE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS VERY ANIMATED 
HOWEVER IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL MAGIC MOMENT 
IT WASN'T SO CONVINCING 
IT LOOKED LIKE HE'D PULLED HIS HANDS OUT FROM BEHIND 
HE LOOKED LIKE WHEN HE DID THAT HE TRIED TO PULL HIS HANDS OUT 
SO THE MAGIC MOMENT WAS MISSED 
BUT EVERYTHING INCORPORATED AROUND IT WAS VERY FUNNY VERY ENTERTAINING 
YOU HAVE FABULOUS STAGE PRESENCE WHAT DO YOU THINK DAVID 
I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE END EFFECT 
IT KIND OF DID GO WRONG 
O. K. THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
SO THAT LEAVES 
THE COMPETITION WIDE OPEN AS THE TROUBLED TRIO TAKE TO THE STAGE 
AND NOW A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE PLEASE FOR MR. KNIGHT'S GROUP 
AS THEY GIVE THEIR ESCAPOLOGY SHOW 
INTERESTING LOTS OF BUMBLING AROUND ON THE STAGE I THOUGHT 
I UNDERSTOOD THE PLOT 
OBVIOUSLY HE'S THE VILLAIN HE'S OBVIOUSLY STOLEN YOUR MAKE UP 
WHAT DID YOU THINK DAVID 
I LOST IT A BIT WITH LIKE YOU SAY THE BUMBLING AROUND SORCERER 
YOU WERE STRUGGLING TO GET THE ROPE OVER YOUR ARM AT ONE POINT 
BUT I'VE GOT TO SAY WHEN I SAW THIS GROUP YESTERDAY 
THEY HAD NOTHING NO ROUTINE AND THEY WERE STRUGGLING TO 
WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM 
THEY'VE COME UP WITH ALL THESE IDEAS AT THIS STAGE UNBELIEVABLE 
WHAT DID YOU THINK 
THESE GUYS DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH SUBSTANCE IN THE CHOREOGRAPHY 
THERE COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE STAGE CRAFT INVOLVED 
THEY HATED IT THEY ALL HATED IT 
YOU COULD HAVE GONE ON YOUR KNEES AND WE COULD HAVE TIED YOU UP 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FUNNY 
WE DIDN'T THINK OF ALL THIS AND SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THIS BEFORE 
BUT HAS IT GONE AS BADLY AS THEY THINK 
IT'S THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE COMPETED IN MIXED GROUPS 
AND NO ONE WANTS TO LET THEMSELVES OR THEIR TEAM DOWN 
WELL WE'VE WATCHED YOUR PERFORMANCES AND 
FABULOUS USE OF THE LATIN AMERICAN LOVELY EXPRESSIONS VERY ANIMATED 
SO AS FAR AS THE WINNER IS CONCERNED WELL I'LL LET YOU KNOW 
OVER LUNCH TODAY AFTER I HAVE MADE MY DELIBERATIONS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
AS THE SORCERER DELIBERATES ONE OF THE TRAINEES IS 
BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED WITH HIS OWN PERFORMANCE 
MEMHET KNOWS HE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER 
WHY DIDN'T YOU ENJOY IT 
IT DIDN'T GO WELL 
YOU DIDN'T MESS UP 
DON'T BE HARD ON YOURSELF 
IT'S HARD WORKING AS TEAM FOR THE FIRST TIME 
COME ON LEARN TO ACT PUT A BIG SMILE ON SHOW ME THAT BIG SMILE 
YES YOUR MASCARA MIGHT SMUDGE MEHMET 
YES DON'T RUIN YOUR MAKE UP ALL THAT EFFORT YOU PUT INTO 
CRYING IT OFF 
DO YOU WANT SOME OF THIS PAPER TOWEL 
MEHMET IS NOT ALONE ALL THE TRAINE HAVE THEIR EYE ON THE PRIZE 
AND WITH JUST FOUR DAYS TO GO

EVERY SECOND OF IT WAS FANTASTIC 
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
NEXT TIME ON THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE 
THE PUPILS CLEAN UP THEIR ACT 
IT'S GONE ALL DOWN MY SHIRT
