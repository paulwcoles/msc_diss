TO RETURN TO VICKY'S FLAT IN NEARBY AVONDALE ROAD TO CARRY ON DRINKING 
SIX WEEKS AGO THIS MAN MARK DIXIE WAS CONVICTED OF THE BRUTAL MURDER OF SALLY ANNE BOWMAN 
HIS APPALLING ACTS SHOCKED THE NATION 
WE DESCRIBE IT AS A FRENZIED KNIFE ATTACK BUT A CONTROLLED FRENZIED KNIFE ATTACK 
THIS IS A HIGHLY DANGEROUS INDIVIDUAL WHO'S COMMITTED THE MOST AWFUL MURDER 
A SAVAGE CRUEL SELF SERVING BEAST 
TONIGHT IN A CRIMEWATCH SPECIAL 
WE TELL THE REMARKABLE STORY OF HOW POLICE CAUGHT HIM 
THERE'S NOT A SECOND OF THE DAY THAT I DON'T THINK OF HER 
IN THE EARLY HOURS OF A SUNDAY MORNING TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO THE BODY OF EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD ASPIRING 
MODEL SALLY ANNE BOWMAN WAS FOUND RIGHT HERE 
SHE'D BEEN BRUTALLY STABBED AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED JUST YARDS FROM HER OWN FRONT DOOR 
THAT EVENING SALLY ANNE WENT OUT DRINKING IN CROYDON WITH ONE OF HER THREE OLDER SISTERS 
AT THE END OF THE NIGHT SHE CONVINCED HER BOYFRIEND OF TWO YEARS LEWIS SPROSTON 
TO LEAVE HIS FRIENDS PICK HER UP 
AND TAKE HER HOME BUT WHEN HE ARRIVED LEWIS WAS FAR FROM PLEASED 
I MUST HAVE MUG TATTOOED ON MY FOREHEAD I HAD NO OTHER WAY OF GETTING HOME 
DON'T START DON'T START 
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG WHAT TOOK ME SO LONG GET IN IT'S FREEZING 
WHY COULDN'T YOU CALL A CAB WOULD YOU RATHER I WAS STRANDED 
I'M NOT A TAXI SERVICE AM I 
I DIDN'T SAY YOU WERE UNBELIEVABLE 
OUR RELATIONSHIP WAS 
IT WAS GOOD BUT WE DID HAVE QUITE A FEW ARGUMENTS 
BECAUSE WE WERE BOTH STUBBORN AND ARGUMENTATIVE 
BUT WE'D ALWAYS GET BACK TOGETHER 
WE'D ALWAYS HAVE BEEN TOGETHER IN MY VIEW IN MY OPINION 
ME AND SALLY WERE GENERALLY JUST DOING WHAT ME AND SALLY ALWAYS DONE 
JUST ARGUING MAKING UP LAUGHING PLAY FIGHTING MESSING ABOUT 
THAT WAS PERFECTLY NORMAL FOR US TO BE OUT AT THEM TIMES IN THE CAR 
LEWIS AND SALLY ANNE SAT IN THE CAR FOR AROUND AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES 
AT ABOUT FOUR TEN LEWIS HAD HAD ENOUGH OF THEIR ARGUING AND DROVE OFF 
LEAVING SALLY ANNE ALONE IN THE STREET JUST TEN YARDS FROM HER FRONT DOOR 
I JUST WISH I COULD HAVE WALKED HER TO HER FRONT DOOR LIKE SOME TIMES I HAVE DONE 
I ALWAYS GO OVER THE WHAT IFS LIKE WHAT IF I'D TOOK HER BACK TO MY HOUSE 
IT DOES AFFECT YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE 
BUT IT'S JUST HARD KNOWING I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO SPEND ANOTHER DAY WITH SALLY 
SEVERAL NEIGHBOURS HEARD SALLY ANNE'S SCREAMS 
BUT DISMISSED THEM AS EITHER A SIMPLE DOMESTIC DISPUTE OR THE CRIES 
OF FOXES A COMMON ENOUGH SOUND IN THAT AREA AT NIGHT 
BUT WHEN THEY LOOKED OUT OF THEIR WINDOWS THEY SAW NOTHING SUSPICIOUS 
AS THEY RETURNED TO THEIR BEDS THE KILLER WENT EVEN FURTHER 
HE HAD INTERCOURSE WITH HER BODY AS SHE LAY DEAD OR DYING 
SALLY ANNE LAY EXPOSED AND UNDISCOVERED ON HER DRIVEWAY UNTIL SIX THIRTY AM 
WHEN HER NEIGHBOURS BEGAN TO RISE 
I GOT THE PHONE CALL EARLY PART OF THE MORNING ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK 
TO SAY THAT A YOUNG GIRL HAD BEEN MURDERED AT THAT TIME DIDN'T KNOW HER NAME IN SOUTH CROYDON 
IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE FIRST OFFICERS ON THE SCENE TO THE DETECTIVES WHO TURNED UP 
THIS WAS GOING TO BE AN HORRIFIC MURDER 
IT WAS CLEAR THAT SHE'D BEEN STABBED A NUMBER OF TIMES IT WAS CLEAR THAT SHE'D BEEN BITTEN A NUMBER OF TIMES 
THERE WAS NO WAY BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE SCENE ITSELF THAT WE WANTED THE RESIDENTS TO SEE SALLY 
SO WHAT WE OFTEN DO IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IS WE TOOK A POLAROID 
AND THE PHOTOGRAPH WAS SHOWN TO ONE OF THE OCCUPANTS WHO IDENTIFIED 
THE GIRL AS SALLY ANNE BOWMAN 
I WAS WOKEN UP WITH A KNOCK ON THE DOOR 
I LOOKED OUT THE BEDROOM WINDOW 
AND SAW TWO POLICEWOMEN IN UNIFORMS AND A GUY IN A SUIT 
SO OBVIOUSLY I WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND OPENED THE DOOR AND THE GENTLEMAN IN THE SUIT SAID ARE YOU MRS. BOWMAN 
I SAID YES HE SAID DO YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER CALLED SALLY ANNE 
THE FIRST THING I SAID WAS WHAT HAVE THEY DONE NOW BECAUSE I KNEW THE SISTERS HAD BEEN OUT TOGETHER 
AND HE SAID CAN WE COME IN SO I SAID YEAH 
AND AS WE WALKED ROUND INTO THE LOUNGE I HADN'T EVEN SAT DOWN 
AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW HE JUST SAID SHE'S BEEN KILLED STABBED TO DEATH 
I JUST REMEMBER SCREAMING AND AS I LOOKED ROUND MY ELDEST DAUGHTER DANIELLE HAD COME INTO THE ROOM 
SHE WAS LITERALLY SLIDING DOWN THE LIVING ROOM DOOR ONTO THE FLOOR 
IT'S KIND OF A DISBELIEF THING THAT GOES COMPLETELY THROUGH YOU 
EVEN THOUGH LINDA'S TOLD ME A POLICE OFFICER TOLD ME IT'S TOTAL DISBELIEF 
YOU DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT THE RULE OF THUMB IS THAT I'LL 
ALWAYS TELL THE FAMILY EVERYTHING UNLESS THERE'S A VERY GOOD REASON NOT TO TELL THEM A SPECIFIC DETAIL 
I'D MADE THE PERSONAL DECISION THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE ME WHO WAS GOING TO 
TELL THEM THE FULL HORRIFIC NATURE OF WHAT HAD BEEN DONE TO SALLY 
IT'S PROBABLY A MOMENT THAT WILL LIVE WITH ME I'M SURE IT'S A MOMENT THAT WILL LIVE WITH SALLY'S FAMILY 
TO HEAR WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOUR EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER SOMEONE WHO'S JUST TURNED EIGHTEEN 
NOT A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE FOR ANYBODY TO HEAR THAT 
TRULY TRULY AWFUL 
SALLY ANNE HAD BEEN STABBED 
SEVERAL TIMES PRINCIPALLY IN THE NECK AND ABDOMINAL AREA 
SO SAVAGE WERE THE STAB WOUNDS THAT IN THREE PLACES THE KNIFE BLADE PASSED RIGHT THROUGH HER BODY 
ENTERING AT THE FRONT AND EXITING AT THE BACK 
WE DESCRIBE IT AS A FRENZIED KNIFE ATTACK BUT A CONTROLLED FRENZIED KNIFE ATTACK 
THE INJURIES THAT SALLY SUSTAINED NOT JUST THE STAB WOUNDS SOME OF WHICH WENT THROUGH THE BODY 
BUT ALSO THE DEFENSIVE INJURIES SOME OF THE WORST DEFENSIVE INJURIES THAT I'VE EVER SEEN 
A SEVERE ONE TO HER HAND WHERE SHE'D UNDOUBTEDLY PUT HER ARMS UP TO PROTECT HERSELF 
AND THE SEXUAL ATTACK AS WELL EVERYTHING SUGGESTED THAT WAS AFTER SHE'D BEEN KILLED 
IT WAS THE SCALE OF THE HORRIFIC INDIGNITIES THAT WERE PERFORMED ON SALLY'S BODY 
JUST INCREDIBLE PAIN 
CRYING SHOUTING WANTING TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE WANTING TO GET TO SALLY 
MYSELF AND SALLY'S NEXT SISTER UP MICHELLE 
HAD TO GO TO THE MORTUARY WHICH IS TWO MINUTES FROM MY FRONT DOOR 
AND I WAS TAKEN INTO THIS ROOM 
I WASN'T ALLOWED TO TOUCH HER OR HOLD HER OR KISS HER 
I JUST TALKED TO HER THROUGH THE GLASS 
I COULD JUST HEAR MICHELLE SOBBING AND SCREAMING AT ME TO WAKE HER UP 
BEGGING ME TO WAKE HER UP 
IN THE INITIAL HOURS AND DAYS OF THE INVESTIGATION SUSPICION INEVITABLY FELL ON SALLY'S BOYFRIEND LEWIS 
AS AN INVESTIGATOR YOU LOOK AT WHO'S ADMITTING TO BE 
WITH THE VICTIM IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THEIR DEATH 
OR WHO'S GOT A SPECIAL CLOSE RELATIONSHIP 
LEWIS FITTED THE BILL ON BOTH THOSE POINTS 
HE ADMITTED BEING AT THE SCENE AND HE ADMITTED HAVING ARGUMENTS 
WHICH WAS SUPPORTED BY WITNESSES OUTSIDE HER ADDRESS 
BUT OVER THE FOUR DAYS HE WAS IN CUSTODY IT WAS QUITE CLEAR TO US THAT HE WASN'T RESPONSIBLE 
THE SWAB THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM SALLY'S NECK FROM THE BITE MARKS TO 
HER NECK WHICH WAS TAKEN AT THE CRIME SCENE BEFORE THE BODY WAS MOVED 
ON THE WEDNESDAY SO THIS IS FOUR DAYS INTO THE INVESTIGATION 
I HAD A CALL FROM THE FORENSIC SCIENTIST AND SHE BASICALLY TOLD ME THERE'S GOOD AND BAD NEWS 
THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU HAVE A MATCH TO THE D. N. A. PROFILE FROM YOUR CRIME SCENE 
THE BAD NEWS IS THAT PROFILE WASN'T LEWIS SPROSTON 
WITH LEWIS ELIMINATED ALL THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTED THAT SALLY ANNE HAD BEEN KILLED BY A STRANGER 
AND POLICE SOON DISCOVERED THAT SHE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN HIS FIRST VICTIM THAT NIGHT 
FORTY MINUTES BEFORE THE MURDER IN NEARBY SANDERSTEAD ROAD 
A WOMAN ON HER WAY HOME HAD PULLED OVER TO MAKE A PHONE CALL 
I'M GOING TO MAKE IT BUT THE CAR'S GIVING ME REAL TROUBLE 
HE LOOKED NORMAL HE LOOKED A NICE YOUNG LAD 
I LOOKED DOWN AND I SAW A KNIFE 
AND THEN HE JUST LOOKED AT ME AND SAID I'M SORRY 
AND THAT'S WHEN HE TOOK THE KNIFE AND HE RAISED IT UP AND I JUST FOLLOWED THE KNIFE GOING 
UP IN THE AIR AND I WATCHED IT COME DOWN ON ME 
I'M SORRY 
HE HIT ME TWICE ON THE HEAD AND HE CUT ME ACROSS THE FACE 
I THEN EVENTUALLY PUT MY HANDS UP TO PROTECT MY FACE AND HE CUT ME ACROSS THE KNUCKLE 
LUCKILY JUST AT THAT MOMENT A TAXICAB CAME INTO VIEW AND THE ATTACKER WAS FORCED TO FLEE 
STOP STOP 
I'M VERY LUCKY THINGS COULD HAVE ENDED UP AN AWFUL LOT WORSE FOR ME 
THE ONE EMOTION I'D SAY THAT I FEEL IS GUILT 
AND I WONDER IF SALLY ANNE'S FAMILY LOOK UPON ME AND THINK IF SHE'D DIED THAT NIGHT 
THEN HE WOULDN'T HAVE ATTACKED AGAIN 
I FEEL GUILTY THAT I SURVIVED AND SOMEBODY ELSE DIDN'T 
THIS IS A HIGHLY DANGEROUS INDIVIDUAL WHO'S COMMITTED THE MOST AWFUL MURDER 
AND THE PUBLIC ARE AT RISK AND THERE WAS AN OVERWHELMING DECISION FROM ALL OF US THAT WE HAD TO DO 
A BIG MEDIA APPEAL AND LET THE PUBLIC KNOW THE SORT OF PERSON THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR 
POLICE HUNTING THE KILLER OF A TEENAGE MODEL HAVE 
SAID THEY COULD BE LOOKING FOR A SERIAL SEX ATTACKER 
OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS STUART CUNDY WAS RARELY OFF OUR SCREENS 
YOU'RE HUNTING A SERIAL SEX ATTACKER I'M SEEKING THE PUBLIC'S ASSISTANCE 
ONE OF THE OUTLETS STUART TURNED TO WAS CRIMEWATCH 
WHERE SALLY ANNE'S LAST KNOWN MOVEMENTS WERE RECONSTRUCTED 
I URGE ANYBODY WHO HAS ANY SUSPICION ABOUT SOMEONE 
CALL THE POLICE OR HERE IT'LL BE TREATED IN CONFIDENCE 
WE COULD NEVER ARTICULATE IN ANY APPEAL THE FULL NATURE OF THE INJURIES THAT SALLY ANNE SUFFERED 
BUT THROUGH THE RECONSTRUCTION I WAS THINKING OF PROVOKING THAT ONE PERSON 
WHO MIGHT HAVE THAT ONE BIT OF SUSPICION ABOUT SOMEONE THEY KNEW OR THEIR NEIGHBOUR 
AND IT WAS ONLY EVER GOING TO TAKE THAT ONE PHONE CALL 
POLICE TURNED THEIR ATTENTION TO PREVIOUSLY UNSOLVED SEXUAL ATTACKS 
THE D. N. A. FOUND ON SALLY ANNE'S BODY MATCHED THAT FOUND AFTER 
A SEXUAL ASSAULT AT A PHONE BOX IN NEARBY PURLEY IN TWO THOUSAND ONE 
BUT THEY STILL DIDN'T HAVE A NAME 
SO THE POLICE HAD TO EMBARK ON A MASSIVE PROCESS OF ELIMINATION 
WE HAD A REASONABLE DESCRIPTION 
HE WAS A WHITE OR LIGHT SKINNED MALE 
WE HAD AN APPROXIMATE AGE BETWEEN TWENTY TO FORTY AND THEN WE HAD THE LOCAL CONNECTION 
TWO KNOWN ATTACKS PLUS THE WOMAN WHO WAS ATTACKED EARLIER IN THE NIGHT ALL IN A VERY SMALL AREA OF CROYDON 
POLICE HAD A MATRIX OF SOME TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NAMES TO WORK WITH 
THEY LAUNCHED AN ENORMOUS HOUSE TO HOUSE OPERATION OF AROUND SIX THOUSAND HOMES 
IN THE AREA AROUND BLENHEIM CRESCENT TRYING TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF THE YOUNG MEN MATCHING 
THE DESCRIPTION WHO WERE IN THE AREA ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER 
WE HAVE SO MANY TECHNIQUES OF IDENTIFYING PEOPLE THROUGH FORENSICS BUT THERE'S NO SUBSTITUTE 
FOR KNOCKING ON PEOPLE'S DOORS AND FINDING WITNESSES AND ALSO FINDING POTENTIAL SUSPECTS 
THEY ALSO LAUNCHED ONE OF THE BIGGEST VOLUNTARY D. N. A. SCREENING PROCESSES IN MET POLICE HISTORY 
LOCAL MEN WERE INVITED TO VOLUNTEER THEIR OWN D. N. A. TO HELP POLICE WHITTLE DOWN THE NUMBERS 
OVER A TWO WEEK PERIOD NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED MEN CAME TO BE SWABBED 
AND EVERY DAY IT WAS TAKING PLACE LINDA BOWMAN AND SALLY ANNE'S SISTERS WERE THERE 
YOU DON'T REALISE THE EFFECT IT HAS HAD ON THE OUTSIDE WORLD HOW MANY HEARTS HAVE BEEN 
BROKEN BY THIS UNTIL YOU GO SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT 
AND YOU SEE PEOPLE AND THEY COME UP AND SHAKE YOUR HAND AND TOUCH YOUR SHOULDER 
AND JUST THE KINDNESS FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO DIDN'T EVEN SALLY DIDN'T KNOW US AS A FAMILY 
IT WAS JUST AMAZING IT WAS A REALLY NICE WARM FEELING THAT PEOPLE DO CARE AND DO WANT TO HELP 
AS WEEKS OF INVESTIGATION TURNED INTO MONTHS THE CLAMOUR TO FIND THE KILLER REMAINED ENORMOUS 
SALLY ANNE'S IMAGE WAS RARELY OFF OUR SCREENS AND OUT OF OUR NEWSPAPERS 
FOR THE DETECTIVES THE PRESSURE WAS HUGE 
DRAINING PHYSICALLY MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY 
A LOT OF THE TEAM KNOW IT DID BECOME AN OBSESSION FOR ME 
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE CAUGHT THE PERSON WHO MURDERED SALLY BEFORE HE ATTACKED AGAIN 
AND THAT WAS ALWAYS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS 
IF HE'S DONE THIS TO SALLY WHAT MIGHT HE DO TO THE NEXT PERSON 
I WAS ALWAYS PROMISED BY EVERYONE IN THE SQUAD THAT THEY WOULD GET HIM ONE WAY OR THE OTHER 
EVERYONE WAS FANTASTIC AND THEY KEPT SPIRITS UP 
BUT YOU DO HAVE IN THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD IS HE EVER GOING TO BE CAUGHT 
IS HE GOING TO GET AWAY WITH THIS 
BUT LUCK WAS ABOUT TO RUN OUT FOR SALLY ANNE'S KILLER 
A TOTALLY UNCONNECTED EVENT WAS TO REVEAL HIS IDENTITY 
NINE MONTHS AFTER THE MURDER THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD CHEF MARK DIXIE WENT OUT WITH FRIENDS TO A SURREY PUB 
TO WATCH ENGLAND IN THE WORLD CUP 
SORRY 
IT WAS AN AFTERNOON THAT WOULD CHANGE THE LIVES OF EVERYONE 
INVOLVED IN THE SALLY ANNE BOWMAN CASE 
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM 
I HAVEN'T GOT ONE YOU HAVE YOU SPILLED MY DRINK ALL RIGHT 
THE FIGHT SPILLED INTO THE STREET WITHIN FULL VIEW OF LOCAL COMMUNITY OFFICERS 
MARK DIXIE WAS ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT AND TAKEN TO CRAWLEY POLICE STATION 
AS IS STANDARD PRACTICE HE WAS PROCESSED AND SWABBED FOR D. N. A. 
AT THE TIME POLICE THOUGHT DIXIE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR NOTHING MORE THAN A SIMPLE PUB FIGHT 
THEY HAD NO IDEA HOW IMPORTANT THIS D. N. A. SAMPLE WOULD PROVE TO BE 
IT WAS SENT TO THE FORENSIC SCIENCE SERVICE FOR ANALYSIS 
TWELVE DAYS LATER THE RESULTS CAME BACK 
IT WAS A PERFECT MATCH FOR THE D. N. A. FOUND ON SALLY ANNE'S BODY 
GUV 
UP UNTIL THIS POINT DIXIE'S NAME HAD NEVER COME UP IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INQUIRY 
I THINK THE FIRST THING THAT PROBABLY WENT THROUGH MY MIND WAS THANK GOD 
NINE MONTHS HAS BEEN A LONG TIME A LONG TIME FOR EVERYONE CONNECTED TO SALLY ANNE OR TO THE INVESTIGATION 
AND THEN IT'S THE ACCELERATION OF 
WE NOW KNOW WHO HE IS WE NOW NEED TO FIND HIM 
WHO IS MARK DIXIE 
BUT DIXIE WAS NO LONGER IN CUSTODY 
HE HADN'T BEEN CHARGED AND HAD BEEN RELEASED HOURS AFTER THE SWAB WAS TAKEN 
POLICE NEEDED TO FIND HIM AND QUICKLY 
IT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO GET AS MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT HIM AS POSSIBLE 
WHERE DID HE LIVE WHERE DID HE WORK WAS HE MARRIED DID HE HAVE ANY CHILDREN 
WHERE WAS HE GOING TO BE SO WE COULD ARREST HIM 
THE TEAM QUICKLY DISCOVERED THAT AT THE TIME DIXIE WAS AT WORK INSIDE A PUB KITCHEN IN CRAWLEY 
BUT THAT PRESENTED POLICE WITH A BIG PROBLEM 
HE HAD KNIVES CLEAVERS POTS OF BOILING WATER 
ANYTHING HE COULD USE AS A WEAPON IN A KITCHEN 
WE HAD TO DECIDE HOW ARE WE GOING TO ARREST HIM SAFELY 
THEY NEEDED TO LURE DIXIE OUT OF THE KITCHEN 
TWO OFFICERS WERE SENT INSIDE THE PLAN BEING TO GET THE PUB MANAGER TO SUMMON DIXIE TO THE OFFICE 
BUT BEFORE POLICE COULD LAY THE TRAP DIXIE STUMBLED RIGHT INTO THEIR HANDS 
I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO GET BACK INTO THE PUB BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE LOST CONTROL OF HIM 
I DIDN'T WANT TO RUN AT HIM BECAUSE HE'D HAVE REALISED THAT WE WERE POLICE OFFICERS 
HE COULD HAVE RUN INSIDE THE PUB TAKEN A HOSTAGE AND CAUSED INJURY TO ANYBODY THERE 
MARK DIXIE 
I TOLD HIM HE WAS BEING ARRESTED FOR THE MURDER OF SALLY ANNE BOWMAN 
WHILST HE WAS BEING RESTRAINED I ACTUALLY HAD TO PLACE 
MY HANDS ON HIS CHEST AND I COULD FEEL HIS HEART 
AND IT DIDN'T MISS A BEAT 
THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN HIS HEARTBEAT 
IT WAS CHILLING THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO REACTION FROM HIM 
THIS IS MARK DIXIE BEING PROCESSED AT SUTTON POLICE STATION 
HE'S STILL WEARING HIS CHEF'S WHITES 
THE PERSON TO THE RIGHT OF DIXIE IS IN NO WAY CONNECTED TO HIM 
SHE'S HIS DESIGNATED APPROPRIATE ADULT 
THESE ARE VOLUNTEERS FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY BROUGHT INTO INTERVIEWS TO ENSURE THEY'RE CONDUCTED FAIRLY 
AND THAT EACH SUSPECT KNOWS THEIR RIGHTS 
IT WAS VITAL THAT THE INTERVIEWING OFFICERS REMAINED OBJECTIVE 
YOU'RE SITTING OPPOSITE SOMEONE 
WHO HAS COMMITTED SUCH A HORRENDOUS CRIME 
YOU'VE SEEN THE PHOTOS OF WHAT HE'D DONE TO SALLY AND IT'S HARD NOT TO BE 
EMOTIONAL BUT YOU'VE GOT TO TO ENSURE YOU DO YOUR JOB PROPERLY 
DIXIE ANSWERED NO COMMENT TO EVERY QUESTION PUT TO HIM 
HE WAS THE SAME THROUGHOUT AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE WORST BITS 
HE SHOWED NO EMOTION WHATSOEVER 
HE VIEWED THAT PHOTO FOR WHAT APPEARED TO BE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME 
LOOKED AT THE GROUND AND AGAIN NO COMMENT 
AND AS SOON AS HE DID THAT I KNEW HE'D COMMITTED THAT OFFENCE 
DIXIE WAS CHARGED WITH THE MURDER LATER THAT NIGHT 
BUT THE WORK WAS FAR FROM OVER 
TO GET IT THROUGH COURT THE POLICE NEEDED TO FIND OUT EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM 
DIXIE HAD BEEN BORN IN STREATHAM IN NINETEEN SEVENTY 
BY THE AGE OF FOURTEEN HE WAS LIVING IN CARE 
A FATHER OF THREE AT THE TIME OF HIS ARREST HE'D SPLIT FROM 
HIS PARTNER AND WAS LIVING IN A ROOM IN THE PUB IN WHICH HE WAS WORKING 
FRIENDS DESCRIBED HIM AS A LARGER THAN LIFE CHARACTER WHO WAS THE LIFE AND SOUL OF THE PARTY 
STARTLINGLY NO ONE WHO KNEW DIXIE THOUGHT THERE WAS ANYTHING STRANGE ABOUT HIM 
THE EVIDENCE ALL POINTED TOWARDS DIXIE HIS D. N. A. WAS ALL OVER BOTH THE CRIME SCENE AND SALLY ANNE'S BODY 
HIS FINGERPRINT WAS FOUND IN BLOOD ON THE BACK OF HER STILETTO SHOE 
BUT POLICE NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND WHY AND HOW DIXIE HAD ENDED UP HERE 
IN BLENHEIM CRESCENT ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER 
IT WAS DIXIE'S THIRTY FIFTH BIRTHDAY 
AROUND SEVEN P. M. THAT EVENING DIXIE AND TWO FRIENDS VICKY CHANDLER AND DIANE GLASSBOROW 
ARRIVED AT THE WINDSOR CASTLE PUB ON THE BRIGHTON ROAD IN SOUTH CROYDON TO MEET SOME OF THEIR MATES 
OVER THE COURSE OF THE EVENING DIXIE A RECREATIONAL DRUG USER 
HAD TWO LINES OF COCAINE AND DRANK SEVERAL PINTS BUT WITNESSES DESCRIBED 
HIM AS BEING LUCID AND STABLE AND BY NO MEANS OUT OF HIS HEAD 
HE SEES A DORSAL FIN BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW IF IT'S A SHARK OR A DOLPHIN 
SO HE STARTS SWIMMING LIKE THAT HE GETS UP DO I GO BACK TO THE PEDALO OR DO I GO TO THE YACHT 
DIXIE'S THEN PARTNER HAD REFUSED TO COME OUT AND HELP HIM CELEBRATE 
ACCORDING TO HIS FRIENDS THIS SEEMED TO UPSET HIM 
FOR A TIME HE BECAME UNCHARACTERISTICALLY QUIET AND WITHDRAWN 
YOU ALL RIGHT YEAH YEAH I'M FINE WHAT WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT 
AT CLOSING TIME DIXIE AND THE GIRLS LEFT THE PUB AND DECIDED 
TO RETURN TO VICKY'S FLAT IN NEARBY AVONDALE ROAD TO CARRY ON DRINKING 
AVONDALE ROAD IS JUST TWO STREETS AWAY FROM BLENHEIM CRESCENT WHERE 
A LITTLE OVER FIVE HOURS LATER SALLY ANNE BOWMAN WOULD BE MURDERED 
WHEN WE GOT BACK TO THE FLAT MARK WAS CHEERFUL 
AND WE JUST HAD NORMAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MUSIC AND FILM AND STUFF 
SATURDAY NIGHT WE GO AND SEE THIS BAND AND THEY'RE CALLED VILLAGE IDIOTS 
THEY'RE REALLY REALLY BAD 
I'M SHOUTING OUT THE VILLAGE PEOPLE 
STARTED GIVING IT Y. M. C. A. 
JUST AFTER TWO ME AND DIANE WENT TO BED LEAVING MARK ON THE SOFA 
DIANE IT'S TWO THIRTY SHALL WE GO OFF TO BED LET'S GO TO BED 
MARK YOU ALL RIGHT HERE YEAH YEAH 
NIGHT NIGHT 
WHEN WE GOT UP THE NEXT MORNING MARK WAS STILL LYING ON THE SOFA 
I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING OUT OF CHARACTER OR DIFFERENT ABOUT HIM 
THE GIRLS HAD NO IDEA THAT IN THE TIME SINCE 
THEY'D LAST SEEN HIM SITTING ON THE SOFA DIXIE HAD COMMITTED ONE OF THE MOST SHOCKING MURDERS IMAGINABLE 
GOOD NIGHT LAST NIGHT WASN'T IT YEAH IT WAS ALL RIGHT 
WITH THE GIRLS TUCKED UP IN BED THIS IS WHAT WE NOW THINK HAPPENED NEXT 
NIGHT MARK NIGHT 
THE MOVEMENTS OF MARK DIXIE ARE SOMETHING THAT WE CANNOT FACTUALLY SAY 
IT'S ONLY MARK DIXIE WHO KNOWS WHAT HE DID 
I THINK HE WENT OUT DEFINITELY ARMED WITH A KNIFE 
THAT COULD'VE BEEN A KNIFE FROM THE PREMISES WHERE HE WAS STAYING IN THE FLAT 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF HIS OWN HE'S A CHEF HE HAS HIS OWN KNIVES' 
DIXIE CLAIMS HE WENT OUT LOOKING TO SCORE SOME DRUGS 
BUT POLICE HAVE NEVER BELIEVED THIS 
I BELIEVE HE WENT OUT WITH THE INTENTION OF ATTACKING AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTING A WOMAN 
WHETHER IT WAS THE INTENT TO KILL OR SOME OTHER ATTACK WHO REALLY KNOWS 
HE FOUND HIS FIRST VICTIM IN SANDERSTEAD ROAD 
CHANCING UPON THE WOMAN WHO'D STOPPED TO MAKE HER MOBILE PHONE CALL AT AROUND THREE THIRTY 
I'M SORRY I'M GONNA MAKE IT BUT THE CAR'S GIVING ME REAL TROUBLE 
I'M SORRY 
BUT HIS ASSUMPTION WILL THEN BE THAT THE POLICE ARE GOING TO BE CRAWLING ALL OVER THIS AREA 
SO I THINK HE THEN WENT TO WHERE HE FELT COMFORTABLE WHERE HE FELT SECURE 
AND I THINK THAT WAS BLENHEIM CRESCENT 
INCREDIBLY DIXIE HAD LIVED IN BLENHEIM CRESCENT IN TWO THOUSAND THREE SOME TWO YEARS BEFORE SALLY ANNE MOVED THERE 
AS HE'S GOT UP THERE HE'S HEARD VOICES 
OR HE'S SEEN SALLY AND LEWIS IN THE CAR 
SALLY WAS IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT 
IT WOULDN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST FOR HIM TO THINK IF THE GIRL'S 
IN THE PASSENGER SEAT SHE'S ABOUT TO BE DROPPED OFF 
LEWIS LEAVES AT ABOUT FOUR TEN IN THE MORNING 
MARK DIXIE THEN LAUNCHES INTO THE FRENZIED ATTACK 
ONCE HE'S STABBED HER HE LEAVES DOESN'T GO FAR PROBABLY GOES BACK TO HIS OLD FRONT GARDEN 
THE REASON THAT I THINK THAT HE LEAVES IS THAT HE'S WAITING TO SEE 
WILL ANYONE COME OUT OF THE HOUSES WILL ANY OF THE BEDROOM LIGHTS GO ON 
HE'S COMMITTED AN ATTACK IN FULL VIEW OF NEIGHBOURING HOUSES' 
THERE ARE NO BEDROOM LIGHTS COME ON NOBODY COMES OUT OF THEIR HOUSE 
WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THERE WAS A GARDEN TAP AT HIS OLD FRONT GARDEN 
THERE'S EVERY POSSIBILITY THAT MARK DIXIE HAD ALREADY GONE AND WASHED OFF 
WHATEVER BLOOD HE MIGHT HAVE HAD ON HIS HANDS BEFORE HE WENT BACK TO SALLY 
AND THAT'S WHEN HE COMMITTED THE SEX ATTACK 
MARK DIXIE HAS THEN STOLEN VARIOUS ITEMS FROM SALLY ANNE 
HE'S STOLEN HER UNDERWEAR HE'S STOLEN HER BAG HER MOBILE PHONE UNDOUBTEDLY AS TROPHIES' 
THEN BACK TO THE FLAT IN AVONDALE ROAD AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED 
DESPITE EXTENSIVE EFFORTS POLICE HAVE NEVER FOUND A MURDER WEAPON 
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HE SIMPLY WASHED IT AND RETURNED IT TO THE KITCHEN WHERE HE'D FOUND IT 
HE THEN RETURNED TO THE SOFA READY TO GREET HIS FRIENDS WHEN THEY AWOKE THE NEXT DAY 
MORNING ALL RIGHT BIRTHDAY BOY YEAH HOW DID YOU SLEEP 
NOT TOO GOOD HOW ARE YOU 
DO YOU WANT COFFEES YOU TWO YES PLEASE MORNING MORNING 
HOW YOU FEELING M. M. M. GOOD NIGHT LAST NIGHT THOUGH 
YEAH IT WAS ALL RIGHT 
IN THE MORNING HE WAS EXACTLY THE SAME 
THERE WAS NOTHING TO SUGGEST HE'D DONE ANYTHING MORE THAN BE ON THE SOFA ASLEEP ALL NIGHT 
WHEN I GOT THE PHONE CALL FROM THE POLICE I WAS IN DENIAL THAT IT COULD'VE BEEN HIM 
COS HE WAS IN THE FLAT LESS THAN FIVE FEET AWAY FROM WHERE WE WERE SLEEPING 
WHEN THE POLICE SAID THEY WERE NINETY NINE PER CENT SURE IT WAS HIM 
MY BODY WENT INTO SHOCK I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE SICK 
IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT NO ONE REALLY KNEW MARK DIXIE 
THE MAN THEY ALL THOUGHT WAS THE LIFE AND SOUL OF THE PARTY WAS IN FACT A SECRET SERIAL SEX OFFENDER 
HE'S CLEARLY GOT THE ABILITY TO INTEGRATE INTO SOCIETY AND COVER UP 
THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS LIFE 
EVERY PERSON THAT WE SPOKE TO FRIENDS FAMILY ALL WERE SURPRISED 
WHEN THEY FOUND OUT MARK DIXIE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HER DEATH 
HE JUST MANAGED TO DECEIVE EVERYONE AROUND HIM AS TO THE SORT OF PERSON HE WAS 
AS POLICE DUG DEEPER INTO HIS PAST THEY DISCOVERED A SHOCKING HISTORY 
DIXIE HAD A STRING OF CONVICTIONS FOR INDECENT ASSAULT AND EXPOSURE STRETCHING BACK TO HIS LATE TEENS 
SO POLICE WERE CONVINCED THAT THE MURDER OF SALLY ANNE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN HIS FIRST VIOLENT ATTACK 
THE NATURE OF THE MURDER THE SEXUAL MURDER OF SALLY 
IT DOESN'T TAKE A POLICE OFFICER IT'S COMMON SENSE TO THINK 
IT WOULD BE SO UNLIKELY FOR THAT TO BE A FIRST OFFENCE 
DETECTIVES SENT DIXIE'S D. N. A. ROUND THE WORLD 
TO SEE IF IT MATCHED ANY UNSOLVED CRIMES ON OTHER COUNTRIES' DATABASES 
WE KNOW THAT BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY THREE AND NINETEEN NINETY NINE MARK DIXIE LIVED IN AUSTRALIA 
IN SIX YEARS IN AUSTRALIA I COULDN'T BELIEVE MARK DIXIE HADN'T DONE SOME AWFUL ATROCITIES OUT THERE 
SO DIXIE'S D. N. A. WAS COMPARED TO THOSE FOUND AT THE SCENES OF A HOST OF SERIOUS UNSOLVED SEX CRIMES 
AND LO AND BEHOLD THEY FOUND A MATCH 
THAT NIGHT A THAI NATIONAL STUDYING AT THE UNIVERSITY WAS ON HER OWN HOUSE SITTING FOR A FRIEND 
HOW'S YOUR BROTHER 
I'LL CALL YOU BACK O. K. 
WHAT DO YOU WANT GIVE ME YOUR MONEY 
I HAVE NO MONEY GIVE ME YOUR MONEY 
PLEASE I HAVE NO MONEY 
I'M A STUDENT I HAVE NOTHING 
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY 
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE YOUR TOP OFF NO 
NO 
THE GIRL WAS STABBED SEVERAL TIMES IN THE BACK AND THEN RAPED WHILST SHE WAS UNCONSCIOUS 
MIRACULOUSLY SHE SURVIVED 
THE ATTACKER LEFT TRACES OF HIS SEMEN ON HER UNDERWEAR 
BUT AUSTRALIAN POLICE HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO MATCH IT TO A NAME 
UNTIL NOW 
THE SEMEN WAS DIXIE'S 
HE'D LEFT THE COUNTRY TEN MONTHS AFTER THE ATTACK 
THERE WERE SO MANY STRIKING SIMILARITIES TO WHAT HAPPENED TO SALLY ANNE 
HE STABBED THIS FEMALE SEVEN TIMES SALLY ANNE WAS STABBED SEVEN TIMES 
SEX HAD TAKEN PLACE WHILE THE VICTIMS WERE UNCONSCIOUS 
AND ITEMS OF PROPERTY HAD BEEN TAKEN AS TROPHIES 
POLICE HAD COMPELLING EVIDENCE AGAINST DIXIE 
BUT ONE QUESTION REMAINED 
WHY HAD HE DONE IT 
HE HAS NEVER ADMITTED HIS PART IN THIS 
THIS IS SOMEONE WHO 
IS ARROGANT IN NATURE 
HAS AN AGGRESSIVE SEXUAL APPETITE 
AND ON THE NIGHT OF SALLY ANNE'S MURDER 
IT WAS HIS BIRTHDAY 
HE WAS ON THE VERGE OF BREAKING UP WITH A PARTNER 
SHE'D REFUSED TO COME OUT ON HIS BIRTHDAY AND I THINK HE WAS QUITE ANGRY 
WHAT MADE DIXIE DO WHAT HE DID 
WAS IT STRAIGHTFORWARD SEXUAL AGGRESSION 
WAS IT DISLIKE OF REJECTION OR THE NEED TO FEEL POWERFUL 
WHATEVER WAS HAPPENING IN DIXIE'S MIND THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT 
THAT SALLY ANNE WAS POWERLESS TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
NO ONE BUT NO ONE WOULD EXPECT TO BE ATTACKED ON YOUR OWN DRIVEWAY BY A MONSTER LIKE MARK DIXIE 
BY UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE MARK DIXIE WAS OUT ON THE PROWL AND CAME 
ACROSS SALLY ANNE AND LEWIS IN THAT CAR AND THEN TOOK HIS OPPORTUNITY 
NEVER MIND THE NATURE OF THE ATTACK ON SALLY I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST 
ONE OF THE MOST SHOCKING THINGS IS THAT YOU KNOW IF IT PERHAPS HAD BEEN TEN MINUTES LATER 
THIS WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SALLY ANNE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN NOBODY 
MARK DIXIE'S TRIAL BEGAN AT THE OLD BAILEY ON FOURTH FEBRUARY THIS YEAR 
HE DIDN'T MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH ANY OF US NOT ONCE 
I COULD HEAR GASPS FROM MY GIRLS 
SEEING HIM 
I THINK IT WAS JUST GASPS OF DISGUST 
MY EYES WERE JUST FIXED ON HIM I COULDN'T STOP LOOKING AT HIM 
DESPITE THE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE 
AGAINST HIM HIS SEMEN ON HER BODY HIS FINGERPRINT IN HER BLOOD HE PLEADED NOT GUILTY 
MARK DIXIE'S DEFENCE AT COURT WAS PREPOSTEROUS 
THAT HE WASN'T THE MURDERER THAT HE WASN'T THERE AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER 
BUT HE HAPPENED ACROSS SALLY ANNE THOUGHT SHE WAS UNCONSCIOUS NOT THAT SHE WAS DEAD 
BUT THOUGHT SHE WAS UNCONSCIOUS AND HE THEN TOOK OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE SEX WITH SALLY 
HE MAINTAINS THAT THE ONLY TIME HE REALISED THAT SHE WAS DEAD WAS AFTER THE SEXUAL ATTACK 
WHEN HE BIT HER AND THERE WAS NO RESPONSE 
THERE WAS SO MUCH BLOOD AT THE SCENE THAT ANYBODY WALKING DOWN THAT ROAD 
WOULD HAVE SEEN SALLY AND REALISED THE NATURE OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER 
HE'D HAVE KNOWN THAT SHE WASN'T JUST UNCONSCIOUS 
HE'D HAVE KNOWN WHEN HE TOUCHED SALLY THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN COLD 
IT'S MY BELIEF THAT HE WAS GETTING GRATIFICATION OUT OF RELIVING WHAT HE'D DONE GETTING GRATIFICATION 
ABOUT PUTTING THE FAMILY THROUGH THE DISGUSTING ACTS THAT HE'D COMMITTED 
WHEN IT COMES FROM THE PERSON WHO'S PERPETRATED A CRIME LIKE THAT 
ON SOMEONE YOU LOVE 
AND HE'S TELLING YOU IN WORDS AND IN ACTIONS IN FRONT OF YOU WHAT HE DID 
MY GOD HOW LOW CAN A HUMAN BEING GO 
EVEN AT THIS LATE STAGE AT THIS ELEVENTH HOUR 
STILL STAND UP THERE AND MAKE IT EVEN WORSE 
BUT THE JURY SAW RIGHT THROUGH HIM 
AFTER JUST THREE AND A HALF HOURS THEY FOUND MARK DIXIE GUILTY OF SALLY ANNE'S MURDER 
I THINK I JUST UTTERED THE WORD YES 
IT WAS JUST VERY EMOTIONAL AND TEARFUL 
I LOOKED ROUND AT HIM IN THE BOX AND HE WAS JUST SHAKING HIS HEAD IN SHEER DISBELIEF 
AS THOUGH HOW CAN YOU SAY YES 
HE ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE DIDN'T DO THIS 
HE'S A SICK HUMAN BEING 
FOR ME IT WAS AN AT LAST 
I WASN'T DENIED THAT MOMENT IN TIME TO HEAR THOSE IMMORTAL WORDS 
TO HEAR THAT WE'D DEFINITELY GOT THE RIGHT MAN 
AND IT WAS A TREMENDOUS FEELING OF SATISFACTION 
AND THEN RELIEF AT THE SAME TIME 
MARK DIXIE WAS NOW NO LONGER ABLE TO WALK THE STREETS OF LONDON 
AND TO COMMIT ANOTHER HORRIFIC ATTACK AS HE'D DONE ON SALLY 
SHE GOT TO ABOUT NINE WHEN LINDA AND I SPLIT 
WHICH WAS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME 
NOT BEING AROUND HER EVERY DAY 
AND I ALWAYS HAD THIS IDEA IN MY HEAD THAT I'D MAKE UP 
WHEN SHE WAS AN ADULT I'D MAKE UP FOR THE TIMES WHEN WE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN TOGETHER 
AND THAT'S BEEN TAKEN NOW 
SO NOW WHAT I'M LEFT WITH IS JUST THE REGRET AND 
THE PAIN OF KNOWING THAT I CAN NEVER MAKE UP 
FOR THE LACK OF 
ME IN HER LIFE 
AND HER IN MINE 
YOU EXPECT TO WALK PAST THE BEDROOM AND SHOUT OUT CAN YOU KEEP THE NOISE DOWN YOU'RE TOO LOUD 
TURN THE VOLUME DOWN 
AND I WAS SITTING THERE THINKING JUST YESTERDAY 
THE AMOUNT OF TIMES THAT I USED TO SCREAM UPSTAIRS IT'S TOO LOUD 
OR HAVE STUPID ARGUMENTS 
YOU LOOK BACK NOW AND YOU REGRET EVERY SECOND OF IT 
I'LL NEVER GET OVER IT 
AND CERTAINLY NEVER EVER 
SAY GOODBYE TO HER I COULDN'T DO IT 
THERE ISN'T A SECOND IN THE DAY THAT I DON'T THINK OF HER 
THE IMPACT OF MARK DIXIE'S BRUTAL AND DEPRAVED ACTS WILL CONTINUE TO 
BE FELT BY ALL THOSE INVOLVED FOR YEARS TO COME 
WE MAY NEVER KNOW WHY HE DID WHAT HE DID TO SALLY ANNE 
BUT THANKS TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST POLICE MANHUNTS IN RECENT TIMES 
HE'LL NOW SPEND AT LEAST THE NEXT THIRTY FOUR YEARS BEHIND BARS 
IS EVERYTHING O. K. EVERYTHING'S FINE 
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE BOY HE MIGHT BE LOOKING FOR 
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
HE'S FEEDING OFF HIS ANGER AND HIS GRIEF YOU CAN'T DO THIS 
FIND OUT WHERE THEY'RE KEEPING HIM 
DAD DAD 
WAKING THE DEAD RETURNS NO
