I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU ARE FREE 
SPENDING IT STPITS IN WITH THE BE 
A FAB THING YOU WERE IN NINETIES 
CONSUMERISM I WILL ASK YOU WAS 
THERE AS MUCH BOLLINGER BEHIND THE 
SCENES HERE YOU ARE 
YOU HAVE GOT 
THE INFORMATION HAVEN'T YOU MOST MOST OF IT YEAH OH YEAH UNTIL THE 
SPECIAL THING BROKE 
WHAT THING 
THE THING THAT'S 
ATTACHED TO THE TYPEWRITER LITTLE 
ANIMAL WITH A BALL 
WHAT ANIMAL 
LITTLE ANIMAL SMALL 
CREEPS ABOUT 
NOT A RAT 
A GERBIL A MOUSE YEAH YEAH I LOVE IT WHAT WAS IT LIKE WORKING 
IN THOSE DAYS WAS THAT AS MUCH FUN 
AS IT LOOKED 
YEAH IT WAS IT WAS 
LOVELY WORKING WITH JENNIFER SHE 
JUST ADAPTED THINGS FOR YOU SO YOU 
COULD BRING THINGS TO THE TABLE AND 
SHE WOULD BE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF 
THAT THAT TELL US ABOUT YOUR NEW PLAY YOU 
CAN PRONOUNCE IT 
THE GOOD SOUL OF SCEHWAN 
I I RAN A 
MILE I THOUGHT MY SMALL BRAIN 
WOULDN'T GET AROUND IT L. THOUGHT 
THAT UNTIL I READ THE PLAY AND THEN 
I THOUGHT I UNDERSTAND THIS IT IS 
VERY EASY A SIMPLISTIC STORY IT 
IS MORALISTIC 
IT IS TWO ROLES YES 
SO YOU PLAY YES AN ALTER EGO YES 
HOW DOES TA PAN YES OUT FOR YOU YOU'RE ON STAGE 
CONSTANTLY IT IS INTENSE THE THE CHARACTER IS CHOSEN BY THE GODS TO 
BE THE GOOD PERSON OF S. ZECHUAN 
SHE FINDS SHE IS IN A CORRUPT 
SOCIETY AND CAN'T SURVIVE SHE 
INVENTS A ALTER EGO THAT IS A MALE 
WHO IS IN WHOSE CHARGE ARE YOU MOST 
COMFORTABLE IN THE GOOD CHARACTER 
OR THE EVIL CHARACTER 
WHAT AM I 
MOST COMFORTABLE I'M ENJOYING BOTH 
THERE ARE LOVELY SCENES FOR BOTH OF 
THEM IT IS QUITE A FETE TRYING TO 
PLAY A MAN L. MEAN THIS CHARACTER 
IS VERY STEELY AND EMOTIONALLESS 
AND COOL SO IT IS TRYING TO CUT 
YOURSELF OFF FROM ANYTHING FEMALE 
THAT YOU'VE GOT AND TRYING TO 
ERADICATE THAT 
YOU SING IN THIS 
ONE AS WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE AN ALL 
LOT OF HARD WORK 
I'M NOT GOING TO 
TAKE ON A SECOND JOB 
YOU'RE TAKING 
ON TWO CHARACTERS SO IT IS THE SAME 
THING THE PLAY WAS WRITTEN IN THE 
WAR YEARS NINETEEN FORTY THREE BUT IT IS A 
TIMELESS TALE BETWEEN RIGHT AND 
WRONG AND TIME CAN BEAT THE MORALS 
OUT OF YOU AS WE GET OLDER DO THE 
MORAL FEELINGS DECLINE TIME FOR 
OUR MORAL GENERATION GAME IT'S THE 
ONE SHOW SAINTS AND SINNERS SURVEY 
I'M GOOD PERSON BECAUSE I ALWAYS 
BRUSH MY TEETH AND ALWAYS HAVE A 
BATH AT NIGHT AND I ALWAYS PUT MY 
PYJAMAS ON 
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE IN 
THE WORLD WHO IS BAD 
WHEN I'M GOOD 
I'M VERY VERY GOOD BUT WHEN I'M 
BAD I'M BETTER 
SOMETIMES IT HELPS TO BE BAD NOW NOW WOULD YOU EVER LIE 
I NEVER TOLD A 
LIE NOT EVEN A LITTLE ONE 
I NEVER 
TELL ANY LIES BECAUSE THEN MY 
FRIENDS WILL BE UPSET AND I WON'T 
HAVE ANY FRIENDS ANY MORE I I WOULDN'T TELL LIES BECAUSE I WOULD 
GET IN TROUBLE 
LITTLE WHITE LIES SOMETIMES SO AS 
NOT TO HURT PEOPLE'S FEELINGS IN IN MY NINETY THREE YEARS I HAVE TOLD LIES WHEN WHEN THE SITUATION REQUIRED I SAID WHAT 
L. HAD TO SAY WHETHER IT WAS A LIE 
I HAD TO SAY WHETHER IT WAS A LIE OR NOT 
WOULD YOU RATHER BE A DEVIL 
OR AN AIN JILL 
I DON'T WANT TO BE 
A DEVIL L. WANT TO BE AN ANGEL 
BECAUSE THEN I CAN HELP OTHER 
PEOPLE 
I WANT TO BE AN ANGEL PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE NIGHT AND NOT 
HORRIBLE 
YEAH DON'T MIND BEING A HORRIBLE DEVIL NOW AND AGAIN 
I THINK A 
DEVIL HAS MORE FUN IN THE LONG RUN 
SO CONCLUSIVELY THE INNOCENCE OF 
YOUTH HAS TRIUMPHED BUT MAYBE 
DEVILS HAVE MORE FUN 
ARE YOU A DEVIL OR ANGEL 
I'M A BIT 
OF BOTH 
DO YOU THINK YOU GET MORE 
UNSCRUPULOUS AS YOU GET OLDER YOU YOU CAN'T ASK A LADY THAT 
I THINK IT 
IS LIKE THE OLD PEOPLE SAID 
WHATEVER IS GOING TO WORK FOR YOU 
AT THE TIME 
YOU JOHN 
I THINK THAT'S THE POINT 
WHEN YOU'RE A CHILD YOU MUST TELL 
THE TRUTH FOR A GROWNUP YOU ARE 
CAREFUL AT BLURTING OUT THE TRUTH T. 
MIGHT HURT PEOPLE IF PEOPLE SAY DO 
YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU HONESTLY 
WHAT'S GOING ON AND THEN FRANKLY 
JOHN THEN MY HEART SINKS L. THINK 
WAIT A MOMENT THIS COULD HURT ME 
OF COURSE YOUR VIEWS CHANGE 
I BET 
THOSE KIDS' PARENTS ARE GOING WILD 
AT THEM TONIGHT ANGEL YOU 
IT IS 
BETTER TO BE HONEST WHEN PEOPLE 
SAY THAT NO 
NOT NECESSARILY ALL 
THIS WEEK ON THE SHOW ANGELLICA 
BELL'S BEEN PAYING TRIBUTE TO THOSE 
PACKING THE MOST IN THEIR LATE 
YEARS GETTING BETTER AT THINGS AS 
THEY GET OLDER ACTIVITIES SHE'S 
LOOKING AT TODAY SHE TAKES TO THE 
SKY WITH A PILOT WHO HAS BEEN 
FLYING HIGH FOR SIXTY FOUR YEARS NOW 
FLYING IS ONE OF THE SAFEST WAYS OF 
TRAVEL YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO MEET 
A STICKY END DRIVING TO THE AIRPORT 
RATHER THAN FLYING TO HOLDAIFPLT 
THERE'S A GOOD REASON FOR THAT 
ALMOST ANYONE CAN GET A DRIVING 
LICENSE BUT TO FLY A PLANE YOU 
HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
TRAINING IS AS ARDUOUS AS TRAINING 
TO BE A DOCTOR WHICH MAKES THIS 
MAN OVER A SIXTY FOUR CAREER THE 
EQUIVALENT OF A BRAIN SURGERY 
WE FLY A D. R. ONE HUNDRED AND HE'S LICENSED 
TO CARRY PASSENGERS ALL OVER EUROPE 
HELLO JIM 
GOOD MORNING 
IT IS AN 
HONOUR TO MEET YOU WHAT 
QUALIFICATION DOS YOU HAVE NOW TO 
FLY THIS PLANE 
I HAVE A JER SEP 
LICENSE SEP MEANS SINGLE ENGINE 
PISTON JER IS EUROPEAN LICENSE TO 
FLY PLANES 
TELL US A BIT ABOUT THE 
FLYING TRIPS YOU DO WHERE DO YOU 
GO AND WHO DO YOU TAKE 
I FLY 
SINGLE SEATERS SO I PREFER FLYING 
BY MYSELF 
BEING EIGHTY ONE DO YOU THINK 
THAT HINDERS YOUR ABILITY TO BE A 
GREAT PILOT OR NOT 
NOT AT ALL L. 
THINK THE BIGGEST CONCERN IS 
PASSING THE MEDICAL AND EVERYTHING 
ELSE IS THE SAME AS IF I WERE TWENTY 
TWENTY ONE 
YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD THEN YES TWENTY ONE YES INDEED AS LONG AS I PASS THE 
MEDICAL I'M O. K. 
SHALL WE GET 
INSIDE 
YES IT'S EASY YOU'LL INSIDE ENJOY IT 
HOW DID YOU GET STARTED 
IN THIS FLYING GAME 
WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN 
AND TEN MONTHS I JOINED THE NAVY 
THE WARFARINISHED BEFORE I FINISHED 
TRAINING I REJOINED IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE AS A 
CADET AND CAME OUT OF THE SERVICE 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE GAINED A COMMERCIAL 
LICENSE BUT THEN THERE WAS SO MANY 
PILOTS I COULDN'T GET A JOB AND I 
HAD TO HAVE A JOB L. GAVE UP FLYING 
FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS UNTIL I DECIDED TO 
START AGAIN PICKED UP THE FLYING 
AGAIN AND GAINED MY PRIVATE PILOT'S 
LICENSE SO FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS 
SORE SO I'VE BEEN FLYING AS AN 
ADMINISTRATOR AND FLYING IN BETWEEN 
SO IS FLYING THIS LITTLE THING 
EASIER THAN BEFORE 
IT IS EASIER 
MAINLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORE 
INSTRUMENTATION YOU KNOW WHAT IS 
GOING ON AND THE WHOLE PLANE IS 
LIGHTER LIGHTER A LIGHTER IT MAY BE BUT LANDING IN 
THIS PLANE IS STILL A GRIPPING 
EXPERIENCE 
BACK ON TERRA FIRMA WE HEAD FOR 
THE OFFICERS MESS WITH SEVENTY TWO YEAR OLD 
GODFFERY AND PAUL FOWLER WHAT IS 
IT ABOUT FLYING THAT KEEPS YOU BACK 
FOR MORE 
FLYING IN ACTUAL IN FACT 
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE PART IN IT 
AND JIM IS AN EXAMPLE IT KEEPS YOU 
YOUNG 
IT IS THE ONE THING 
I THINK YOUNG I CAN DO WELL AND I'VE ALWAYS 
ENJOYED IT 
SO PAUL WHAT DO YOU 
THINK OF THE YOUNG WHIPPER 
SNAPPERS 
NUISANCE IN THE SKIES IT SNAPPERS IS GREAT IT DEMONSTRATES TO PEOPLE 
THAT ONCE YOU GOT A PASSION YOU 
CAN KEEP IT GOING IT IS THE 
PASSION THAT'S THERE PEOPLE CAN 
LEARN TO FLY WELL IN THEIR SEVEN ZEROS 
AND EIGHTIES AND SOME ARE BETTER 
BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT THE LIFE SKILLS 
AND THEY TEND TO BE LESS GUNG HO 
SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING 
THAT YOU CAN DO JUST AS WELL IN 
YOUR EIGHT ZEROS AND TWENTIES FORGET ABOUT 
PLAYING BRIDGE OR DOING THE CROSS 
WORD YOU NEED TO TAKE UP FLYING 
IT IS INTERESTING POINT THERE YOU 
GOT BETTER AS YOU GET OLDER DO YOU 
GET BETTER AS AN ACTOR WHEN YOU GET 
OLD SNER 
PERHAPS THE PARTS GET MORE 
ROUNDED SO YOU'VE MORE LIFE 
EXPERIENCE YOU CAN BRING YOUR LIFE 
EXPERIENCE TO THE PART BUT I THINK 
WHEN YOU'RE VERY OLD AS AN ACTOR 
THE LINES THEN BECOME QUITE A WORRY 
I THINK OF PEOPLE LIKE LIZ SMITH 
WHO SEEMS TO GET BETTER WITH AGE 
SHE'S ALWAYS FANTASTIC OLD 
CHARACTER ACTORS BECOME MORE AND 
MORE WONDERFUL I THINK BECAUSE 
THEY SEEM TO BE RARER 
THE ROLES EVOLVE AND ARE CREATED TO 
SUIT YOU AS WELL YOU'RE WELL 
ESTABLISHED WE WERE READING THINGS 
OF WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN SUPPOSEDLY 
LIVE LONGER ACCORDING TO OF 
RESEARCHERS I'M GOING TO LIVE TWELVE 
YEARS LONGER BECAUSE OPTIMISTIC 
PEOPLE LIVE LONGER THAN 
PESSIMISTSTIC 
I WILL BE GONE ANY PESSIMISTSTIC DAY NOW

SOUTH PACIFIC AND THEY DIDN'T GET 
OFF THE PORTS THAT WAS ONE WAY OF 
TELLING AND CREW WAS TAKING BETS 
HOW MANY WOULD SURVIVE 
IN THE 
NICEST POSSIBLE WAY FROM A MODERN 
CRUISE SHIP TO THE BEGINNING OF THE 
TRANSPORT REVOLUTION EXPERTS 
ESTIMATE THE WHEEL WAS IN THE FOURTH 
B. C. IT MUST BE A BUMPY RIDE 
BECAUSE IT WAS ANOTHER FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT YEARS 
THAT ANYONE THOUGHT OF INVENTING 
THE TYRE 
DAN SNOW THANKED HIM FROM THE 
BOTTOM OF HIS HEART 
I RIDE MY BIKE 
EVERYWHERE IT IS CHEAP GREEN AND 
QUICK THANKS TO A RATHER CUNNING 
INVENTION MADE HERE IN BELFAST OVER 
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO IT IS ALSO 
COMFORTABLE COMFORTABLE BUT THAT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN THE 
CASE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO THE FIRST 
BICYCLES HAD SOLID WHEELS THEY 
WERE SO UNFORTUNATELY THEY WERE 
NICKNAMED BONE BONE SHAKERS 
THEY'VE COME IN ALL SHAPES AND 
SIZES HEALTHY AND EMISSION FREE 
THERE'S NO SURPRISE THEY'VE BECOME 
A BEIGE OF HONOUR FOR THE MODERN 
POLITICIAN I VERY MUCH DOUBT THAT 
DAVID CAMERON WOULD BE CYCLING TO 
HIS OFFICE EVERY DAY IF THE MAN 
WHO USED TO WORK HERE HADN'T COME 
UP WITH AN IDEA THAT MADE HIM A 
HOUSEHOLD NAME HIS NAME WAS JOHN 
DUNLOP HIS IDEA WAS TO GET A 
RUBBER TUBE FILL IT WITH AIR AND 
ATTACH IT TO THE BICYCLE WHEEL HE 
WAS A SCOTTISH VET HE BEGAN 
EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS KNEW MATIC 
TYRE WHEN HE SAW THE PAIN HIS SON 
WAS IN RIDING THE COBBLED STREETS 
IN BELFAST ON HIS SOLID WHEELED 
TRIKECAL MARK KENNEDY EXPLAINS IT 
WAS AN AGE WHEN NORMAL AGE INVENTED 
THESE INCREDIBLE THINGS HOW DID HE 
DO IT 
THE VERY SIMPLY HE GOT SOME 
SHEET RUBBER CUT IT OUT GLUED IT 
TOGETHER WITH SOLUTION GLUE AND 
USED HIS SON'S FOOTBALL PUMP TO 
PUCH IT UP 
WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL IT 
MAKE 
THE BEST WAY IS TO FIND OUT MAKE WHAT A SOLID TYRE WAS LIKE WHAT WHAT BETTER INTRODUCTION TO SOLID TYRES

MAKE A VERSION OF HIS TYRE 
THERE IS THE WORKSHOP DUNLOP MADE 
THE ORIGINAL TYRE WITH RUBBER 
SHEETING WE'RE CHEATING BY ADAPT 
AGO STANDARD BICYCLE IN A TUBE BUT 
ATTACHING IT TO A WHEEL AS PER HIS 
DESIGN WITH SHEETS OF CANVAS AND 
TACKS TACKS THAT'S LOOKING GOOD 
MOMENT OF TRUTH HOW DO WE TEST IT 
THROW IT DOWN THE ROAD 
HIGH TENSION HERE ON THE TESTING 
FACILITY FACILITY THAT'S A TYPICAL SOLID TYRE OF THE 
PERIOD TRY BOUNCE TEST FIRST 
NOT IMPRESSIVE 
GIVEN THIS HE MADE IT IN ONE 
AFTERNOON HE DID IT IN A BIT MORE 
TIME 
LOOK AT THAT NOT VERY FAR 
YOU CAN SEE HOW IT WAS BEGINNING OF 
A TRANSPORT REVOLUTION 
IT WAS 
DUNLOP'S TYRE WENT INTO 
PRODUCTION ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETEEN AND CHANGED THE 
WORLD OF CYCLING AND ALL ROAD 
TRANSPORT FOREVER EYE IRONICALLY 
IT DIDN'T MAKE HIS FORTUNE FIVE 
YEARS LATER HE SOLD HIS PATENT BUT

THIS DAY IS STILL ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST BRANDS IN THE WORLD L. BET 
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ONE AS BIG AS
