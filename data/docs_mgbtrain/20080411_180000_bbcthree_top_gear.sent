TONIGHT IS A PEUGEOT FASTER THAN TWO MEN 
HAS LAMBORGHINI GONE MAD AGAIN 
AND CAN WE BUILD A WHOLE CAR IN EIGHT HOURS 
HELLO AND WELCOME WE START TONIGHT WITH PEOPLE CARRIERS 
WE'VE ALWAYS SAID THEY'RE FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE REALLY GIVEN UP ON LIFE 
YOU KNOW IT'S BORN MARRIED CHILDREN PEOPLE CARRIERS STANNAH STAIR LIFT DEAD 
THING IS THOUGH THERE ARE NOW SOME NEW PEOPLE CARRIERS 
WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SENSIBLE AND FUN TO DRIVE 
SO RICHARD AND JAMES HAVE BEEN OUT AND ABOUT TO SEE WHAT'S WHAT 
YES THAT'S OUR TASK FOR TODAY TO TRY AND FIND A FAMILY CAR 
THAT HAS SOME ZEST AND CHARISMA TO IT 
A CAR THAT BASICALLY SAYS DADS DON'T DESPAIR 
OUR FIRST CONTENDER IS THE BRAND NEW FORD S. MAX 
IT'S LIKE THE GALAXY PEOPLE CARRIER BUT WITH BIG ALLOY WHEELS 
AND THREE INCHES LOPPED OFF THE ROOFLINE 
SO IT'S LOWER AND SPORTIER 
YOU CAN GET IT WITH THE TURBO CHARGED ENGINE FROM THE FORD FOCUS SO IT'S FASTER 
AND NOW HERE'S JAMES WITH THE NEXT CONTENDER 
IT'S THE MERCEDES B. CLASS 
KEEN STUDENTS OF THE ALPHABET WILL PROBABLY HAVE WORKED OUT ALREADY 
THAT THIS IS ONE UP FROM THE A CLASS 
THIS CAR PRIDES ITSELF ON HAVING THE MAXIMUM INTERIOR SPACE 
FOR THE LEAST EXTERIOR SIZE 
AND THIS IS THE B. TWO HUNDRED VERSION WITH TURBO POWER 
OH AND THAT MAKES ME FEEL REALLY GOOD 
AND FINALLY FROM LUTON THE VAUXHALL ZAFIRA VXR 
BLIMEY 
NOW THIS HAS A TWO LITRE TURBO CHARGED ENGINE 
PUTTING OUT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN BRAKE HORSEPOWER 
AND BECAUSE OF THAT IT CLAIMS THE TITLE OF WORLD'S FASTEST M. P. V. 
SO THERE WE ARE THEY'RE ALL PEOPLE CARRIERS 
THEY'RE ALL TURBO CHARGED 
AND THEY ALL COST BETWEEN TWENTY THOUSAND AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND 
TIME THEN TO FIND A WINNER 
AND THIS BEING TOP GEAR WE START WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION 
WHICH ONE'S THE FASTEST 
AND FOR THAT WE NEED AN INDEPENDENT ADJUDICATOR 
SOMEONE WHO HAS NO MORTGAGE NO NINE TO FIVE JOB AND NO CHILDREN 
THREE TWO ONE GO 
THE B. CLASS IS THE LEAST POWERFUL HERE 
WITH ONLY ONE HUNDRED NINETY HORSEPOWER 
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE FROM HERE SLOW 
IT'S ALSO THE SMALLEST AND THE LIGHTEST 
HERE HE COMES 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX POINT OH SIX 
THREE TWO ONE GO 
WHEEL SPINNING START VERY UN FAMILY 
AT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY BRAKE HORSEPOWER IT'S THE SECOND MOST POWERFUL BUT IT'S THE BIGGEST 
LAST CORNER HERE IT COMES 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX TO BEAT 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN POINT OH THREE IT'S SLOWER 
BE BE BE BE BE WHEEL SPIN REV LIMITER ACTION 
IF THIS THING ISN'T THE FASTEST 
THERE'S RATHER A NICE OLD CHURCH OVER THERE 
WITH TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN HORSEPOWER THE VXR IS THE QUICKEST ON PAPER 
BUT WILL IT BE ABLE TO USE ALL THAT POWER 
OR WILL IT UNDER STEER WILDLY LIKE THAT VECTRA LAST WEEK 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX POINT FOUR FOUR 
TECHNICALLY THAT'S SECOND UH 
WHICH MEANS THE MERCEDES IS FASTEST THE MERCEDES HAS WON 
THAT'S THE FORD'S SLOWEST 
NOW MOST FAMILY CARS ARE BORING TO LOOK AT 
BUT THESE THREE HAVE MADE AN EFFORT TO LOOK LIVELY 
HOWEVER THE ZAFIRA VXR TRIES A BIT TOO HARD 
WE LIKE THE CHUNKY EIGHTEEN INCH ALLOYS 
BUT THE SKIRTS AND SPOILERS ARE ALL A BIT MID LIFE CRISIS 
AS FOR THE MERCEDES AGAIN WE APPROVE OF THE BIG A. M. G. WHEELS 
BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS A BIT TOO DARK AND DULL 
THE S. MAX HOWEVER IS JUST RIGHT 
THE INTERIOR IS UP TO DATE AND ON THE OUTSIDE IT'S SMOOTH AND SLEEK 
NICE GILLS TOO 
WITH THAT SORTED WE TOOK THE CARS FOR A DRIVE STARTING WITH PETER STRINGFELLOW 
OOH DO YOU HAVE TO DO THAT 
WELL IT'S THE WORLD'S FASTEST M. P. V. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT DOES GO QUITE WELL BUT IT TORQUE STEERS LIKE A. 
IT SETS OFF IN WHICHEVER WAY THE WHEELS WANNA GO IN ANY GIVEN MOMENT 
THE LAIRYNESS WASN'T THE ONLY PROBLEM 
COMFORTABLE NOT REALLY IT'S A BIT JIGGLY 
NEXT UP THE MERCEDES B. CLASS 
IT'S GOT QUITE A LOT OF KIT BUT I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY 
IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY 
WHAT'S THE STANDARD ONE OF THESE IT'S TWENTY THREE GRAND ACTUALLY 
BUT THIS ONE COSTS 
THIRTY ONE 
THIRTY ONE THERE'S A LITTLE BUTTON THAT MAKES THE MIRRORS FOLD IT'S HERE 
THERE'S A LITTLE BUTTON THERE 
GO ON ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE QUID 
I LIKE THE SUNROOF KIDS WOULD LOVE THAT 
OH LISTEN YOU CAN HEAR THE TURBO YOU CAN I LOVE HEARING A TURBO 
FINALLY THE FORD S. MAX 
SOUNDS GOOD IT DOES SOUND GOOD 
GIVE IT A BOOTFUL YOU HAVEN'T GOT THAT MAD TORQUE STEER 
RIDE'S A GOOD COMPROMISE YOU CAN FEEL THE BUMPS BUT 
YOU COULD SAY IT WAS INFORMATIVE BUT NOT UNCOMFORTABLE 
ABSOLUTELY IF YOU WERE A BIT OF AN IDIOT YOU COULD SAY THAT 
THE S. MAX JUST HANDLED ITS POWER MUCH BETTER THAN THE VXR 
WITH THE VXR IT'S A LOT OF FUN IT'S THE FASTEST IT'S GOT A TURBO 
THE CHILDISH STUFF IS GREAT BUT DAY TO DAY IT'S GOING TO DRIVE YOU ROUND THE TWIST 
WHATEVER THE DIFFERENCES THE AMAZING THING WAS WE'D SPENT A DAY DRIVING PEOPLE CARRIERS 
AND HADN'T LOST THE WILL TO LIVE 
HEY 
NOW 
SO WE'VE ESTABLISHED IN THE FILM THEN THAT THEY ARE FUN TO DRIVE YEAH ALL THESE THREE YEAH 
AND THAT THE MERCEDES IS THE FASTEST ROUND A TRACK IT IS 
BUT IT'S THIRTY ONE THOUSAND WHICH IS VERY EXPENSIVE 
AND YOU ONLY GET FIVE SEATS EVEN IF YOU'VE GOT TWO KIDS THEY'LL WANT TO BRING FRIENDS YOU NEED SEVEN SEATS 
EXACTLY DON'T BUY THAT FORD OR VAUXHALL O. K. 
I'VE ALWAYS QUITE LIKED THE ZAFIRA BECAUSE IT'S GOT THIS BRILLIANT SEAT ARRANGEMENT IN THE BACK O. K. 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIFT THE SEATS IN AND OUT THEY FOLD IN THE FLOOR AND THEN YOU JUST 
YOU JUST LIFT IT OUT YOU LIFT IT OUT YOU FOOL 
HAS ANYBODY GOT A ZAFIRA YOU MOVE THE BACK SEATS FORWARD 
WE KNEW THAT MOVE THE BACK SEATS FORWARD 
WHERE'S THE LEVER 
THAT DOESN'T HELP WHERE'S THE LEVER 
BEHIND THE SEAT THAT ONE WE KNEW THAT 
WE'RE REALLY GOOD ON THIS SHOW AT CONTROLLING POWER SLIDES BUT NOT THIS 
AND THEN YOU CAN JUST LIFT THESE SEATS 
THIS IS BAD THIS IS EMBARRASSING 
YOU'VE GOT A SHOPPING BAG CHILD SEAT BRUTE FORCE IS ALWAYS THE ANSWER 
I MIGHT HAVE BROKEN THAT 
HANG ON SORRY HAVE YOU GOT A ZAFIRA 
COULD YOU JUST COME AND GIVE US A HAND I'VE BROKEN IT 
NO NO NO IT'S THIS LOOK 
YEAH YOU HAVE BROKEN THAT 
THAT SHOULD LOCK UNDER THERE 
HAVE YOU WORKED IN A VAUXHALL DEALERSHIP THERE YOU GO THANK YOU 
THAT'S UM QUITE EMBARRASSING 
I FEEL A BIT SILLY MATE 
YEAH I'M GOING TO JUST 
AH THERE YOU GO 
THAT'S IT YEAH 
THAT'S UP 
THE THING IS ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT YOU'VE GOT TO GET IN THERE 
EVEN I COULDN'T GET IN THERE THE BOOT'S FAR TOO SMALL 
THERE ISN'T ANY BOOT BUT YOU DON'T GET ANY OF THOSE PROBLEMS WITH THE FORD 
I HAVE HAD A GO WITH THIS ONE SIMILAR SYSTEM BUT BETTER 
OPEN THE BOOT LIFT THE SEAT SQUABS ONE TWO 
LIKE THAT UP WITH THE BACK 
DOWN AND THERE YOU GO SEVEN SEATS ALL IN PLACE 
AND AND WHAT'S MORE LOOK 
COME BACK WITH YOUR HEAVY SHOPPING JUST ONE LEVER SLIDES THAT FORWARDS 
THEN YOU CAN GET IN NOT ONLY THAT YOU'VE GOT A PROPER BOOT SPACE 
THERE'S A BIT UNDER THERE AND THE ACTUAL BOOT YOU COULD GET TOP GEAR IN FACT I'LL GET HER 
COME ON TOP GEAR DOG TOP GEAR DOG GOING IN THE BOOT 
IF I CAN LIFT HER TOP GEAR DOG HAS A USE SHE CAN GO IN QUITE HAPPILY 
NO DOGS WERE HARMED IN THE MAKING OF THIS PROGRAMME PUT YOUR HEAD UP THERE THERE 
YOU SEE IT WORKS 
AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN THE ZAFIRA 
OH YEAH 
THE FORD IS THE MOST PRACTICAL WE'VE SHOWN THAT 
IT'S NOT THE FASTEST ON THE TRACK BUT IN THE REAL WORLD IT'S THE BEST ONE TO DRIVE 
IT'S THE BEST LOOKING AND IF YOU GET THE BASIC ONE IT'S THE CHEAPEST LET'S DO THE NEWS 
YES AND WE BEGIN WITH GOOD NEWS WHICH IS THAT M. G. IS BACK 
SORT OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENED IS THAT THE CHINESE COMPANY WHICH BOUGHT THE RIGHTS TO THE M. G. ROVER NAME 
HAS SAID THAT IT WILL REOPEN THE LONGBRIDGE FACTORY 
AND THAT NEXT YEAR IT WILL START MAKING THE M. G. T. F. AGAIN HOLD ON 
AREN'T THEY GOING TO MAKE IT IN CHINA TAKE IT TO PIECES 
SHIP IT HERE AND THEN ASSEMBLE IT IN BIRMINGHAM SO THEY CAN SAY IT'S BRITISH YES AS WE UNDERSTAND IT 
BUT THE CHINESE THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO BE INVESTING TEN MILLION IN LONGBRIDGE YEAH YEAH 
BUT I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON THIS 
SERIOUSLY MERCEDES SPENT TEN MILLION ON RESEARCH ALONE 
EVERY SINGLE DAY SO WHERE'S THAT GOING TO GO AND THEY END UP WITH CARS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO BUY 
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYONE I'VE EVER MET WHO THINKS YES MY LIFE WOULD BE COMPLETE 
IF I COULD BUY AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD SPORTS CAR THAT'S MADE IN CHINA 
AND THEN NAILED TOGETHER BY A BUNCH OF BLOKES IN BIRMINGHAM THE THING THAT YOU'RE FORGETTING 
IS THE GREAT AFFECTION THAT IS FELT ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR THE TRADITIONAL BRITISH SPORTS CAR 
HEY I'VE GOT BIG MOTORING NEWS THIS WEEK OF MY OWN 
BOUGHT A NEW FAMILY CAR VERY EXCITED 
I BOUGHT A SECOND HAND LAND ROVER DEFENDER IT'S A SPECIAL EDITION IT'S BRIGHT YELLOW 
BECAUSE THEY DON'T MAKE IT ANY MORE THEY GAVE US A POT OF YELLOW PAINT 
TO TOUCH OUT ANY SCRATCHES OH YEAH FIRST DAY IN IT FAMILY PILED IN AN ADVENTURE IN OUR NEW CAR 
TWO MILES DOWN THE ROAD LET'S GO FOR OUR FIRST FILL UP IN A PETROL STATION WENT TO TURN LEFT 
I LOOKED ACROSS AND SAW MY WIFE HOLDING THE POT OF PAINT 
THAT MUST HAVE PRESSURISED IN THE HEAT BECAUSE EVERYTHING APART FROM HER EYES EVERYTHING WAS YELLOW 
THE CARPET THE CEILING ALL DRIPPING OFF 
IT LOOKED LIKE A TEENAGER'S MIRROR IT WAS JUST RUINED 
IT WAS JUST DRIP DRIP 
I HAD A FAMILY OUTING THIS WEEK IN MY FORD G. T. 
TOOK MY SON TO THE FAIRFORD AIRSHOW GLOUCESTERSHIRE AND 
IT'S STILL THERE 
IT DECIDED THAT IT DIDN'T WANT TO LET THE ENGINE TO REV BEYOND SIX HUNDRED R. P. M. WHICH ISN'T MUCH 
NOT ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY MAKE PROGRESS OH NOW 
LOTS OF NEW CARS HAVE BEEN COMING OUT IN RECENT WEEKS THERE'S THIS NEW HONDA CIVIC TYPE R. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT CAR TO DRIVE YOU JUST KNOW BY LOOKING AT IT 
THERE'S A NEW LAND ROVER FREELANDER AGAIN YOU KNOW THAT'S ALL GOING TO BE FINE 
NEW CHRYSLER IT'S CALLED THE SEBRING 
YOU LOOK AT THAT AND YOU KNOW IT'LL BE RUBBISH IT WILL WON'T IT 
YOU KNOW THEY'RE IN TROUBLE 
I WAS READING THE DETAILS THEY SENT US A ONE PAGE THING ON THAT CAR 
ONE PAGE TO GET ALL THE THINGS ABOUT THAT CAR 
HALFWAY DOWN THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW THE CUP HOLDERS WILL CHILL YOUR DRINK AS YOU'RE DRIVING ALONG 
YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN TROUBLE WHEN THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT THAT IS DESPERATION ISN'T IT 
OH QUICKLY THE TOP GEAR SURVEY IT'S WHERE YOU TELL US ABOUT CARS 
WE CAN TELL YOU HOW FAST THEY ARE HOW BIG THE BOOT IS 
BUT NOT WHAT THEY'RE LIKE TO LIVE WITH FROM DAY TO DAY 
SO IF YOUR CAR IS AN OH THREE A FIFTY THREE AN OH FOUR OR A FIFTY FOUR PLATE WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU WHATEVER IT IS 
ANY EXPERIENCES YOU'VE HAD WITH YOUR CAR OR THE DEALERSHIP MAYBE HE HAS THE MANNERS OF A BABOON 
WRITE TO US WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT AND IF YOU GO TO THE WEBSITE BBCCOUK SLASH TOPGEAR WHAT 
IT'S VERY GOOD YOU REMEMBERED IT THAT'S IT 
TALKING OF GETTING IN TOUCH SOME PEOPLE GOT IN TOUCH AFTER LAST WEEK'S SHOW TO COMPLAIN THEY DID 
I SAID SOMETHING ABOUT A MUSLIM O. K. TWO COMPLAINTS 
REMEMBER JESUS LAST WEEK TALKED TO HIM THREE COMPLAINTS 
WE WERE SLIGHTLY RUDE ABOUT CARAVANNERS WE SET ONE ON FIRE A BIT 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY COMPLAINTS 
SERIOUSLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE NOW DEMANDING AN APOLOGY THEY ARE SO WE REALLY ARE SORRY 
AND WE PROMISE THAT WE WILL ALL THREE OF US 
NEVER EVER GO CARAVANNING AGAIN NO NO NO NO I'M SORRY WE DIDN'T BURN MORE CARAVANS 
RIGHT SO AM I YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
RIGHT NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PORSCHE NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN 
O. K. NOW THIS IS DESIGNED TO BE AS FAST AS THE LAWS OF PHYSICS ALLOW 
AND THAT'S GREAT BUT IT'S RATHER A SERIOUS CAR IT DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF A SENSE OF HUMOUR 
AND IT'S THE SAME STORY WITH THE FERRARI FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY 
YOU DON'T WANT TO SIT NEXT TO SOMEONE AT DINNER WHO'S GOT ONE 
IN CASE HE STARTS TELLING YOU ABOUT HIS FIVE WAY TRACTION CONTROL 
THERE IS HOWEVER ONE SUPER CAR MAKER THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT 
LAMBORGHINIS ARE FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MOVE ABOUT IN A BIG PANTOMIME 
A MASSIVE WEST END MUSICAL FULL OF COLOUR OF NOISE 
AND TO HELL WITH HOW FAST YOU CAN GO ROUND A CORNER 
UNFORTUNATELY THE GALLARDO THE BABY LAMBO 
NEVER REALLY CUT THE MUSTARD 
AS YOU'D EXPECT IT ISN'T QUITE AS NICE TO DRIVE AS A FERRARI FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY 
THE STEERING ISN'T QUITE AS DELICATE THERE'S LESS IMMEDIACY FROM THE ENGINE 
THERE'S NOT QUITE AS MUCH POISE 
SURE IT HAS A FLAPPY PADDLE GEARBOX AND THEY DRESSED UP THE POWER A BIT 
BUT IT STILL ISN'T A PROPER DRIVER'S CAR 
NOW THAT WOULD BE FINE 
IF IT WAS FLAMBOYANT AND MAD BUT IT ISN'T 
IT FEELS SORT OF LIKE A BIG AUDI T. T. 
NOW THOUGH THEY'VE LAUNCHED A ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE THOUSAND CONVERTIBLE VERSION 
AND I'M DELIGHTED TO SAY 
THE LUNACY'S BACK 
THERE ARE FAULTS 
THE STEERING WHEEL FOR INSTANCE IS COVERED IN A BATHMAT 
AND IF YOU PUSH THE SEATS ALL THE WAY BACK AS I HAVE TO IT SQUEAKS AGAINST THE FIREWALL CAN YOU HEAR 
IT DOES THAT THE WHOLE TIME YOU'RE DRIVING ALONG AND YOU CAN NEVER FIND THE SEATBELT AND I DON'T CARE 
SURE YOU'RE GOING TO GET PEOPLE COMING UP TO YOU SAYING 
OH YOU COULD HAVE GONE ROUND THAT CORNER OH OH OH THREE OF A SECOND FASTER IF YOU'D HAD A FERRARI 
OOH YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE HUNDRED K. G. HEAVIER THAN THE COUPE DON'T YOU 
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER 
BECAUSE I'VE GOT NINETY THREE MILLION MILES OF HEADROOM AND I'VE GOT ORANGE SEATS AND LISTEN TO THIS 
OH HO HO HO 
THAT'S THE SOUND OF A FIVE LITRE V. TEN ENGINE 
IT'S THE NOISE OF FIVE HUNDRED TWELVE RAMPAGING ITALIAN HORSEPOWERS 
IT'S LIKE LISTENING TO THE CIRQUE DU SOLEIL BEING CHOPPED UP BY THEIR OWN CHAINSAWS 
ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE MOST ABOUT THIS CAR THOUGH 
IS THAT THEY'VE PAINTED IT GREY AND FITTED ACTIVE EXHAUSTS 
WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO BE QUIET AT LOW SPEEDS 
BUT THEY'RE NOT FOOLING ANYONE 
YOU CAN TRY TO DRIVE IT QUIETLY IF YOU WANT TO BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE 
BECAUSE IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY STRAY OVER THREE FIVE HUNDRED R. P. M. 
YOU JUST GET THIS SORT OF BARK LIKE THAT HEAR THAT QUIET 
BARK ARGH 
DRIVING THROUGH MY LOCAL TOWN THE OTHER DAY 
AND I NEARLY GAVE SOME OLD WOMAN ON THE PAVEMENT A HEART ATTACK SORRY LOVE SORRY 
THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF REMOVING A DODGY TOOTH 
THE FERRARI WAY WHICH IS AN EXQUISITE HIGH SPEED DRILL 
AND THERE'S THE LAMBO WAY WHICH IS BIG HAMMER YAH 
THIS IS BEING ALIVE NOW 
WHO CARES ABOUT FIVE WAY TRACTION CONTROL 
I DON'T WANT THAT 
I WANT MORE OF THIS 
I'M IN LOVE 
IT ISN'T ALL CLOWN SHOES AND SPINNING BOW TIES THOUGH 
IT HAS FOUR WHEEL DRIVE SO THERE'S LOTS OF GRIP 
IT'LL GO FROM ZERO TO SIXTY IN FORTY SEVEN SECONDS 
AND FLAT OUT IT'LL BE DOING ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
THAT IS PRETTY SERIOUS 
BETTER STILL IT HAS A PROPER GEARBOX 
THE FLAPPY PADDLE NONSENSE IS A FIVE THOUSAND OPTIONAL EXTRA 
WHAT'S MORE LAMBO IS OWNED THESE DAYS BY AUDI SO YOU EVEN GET SOME GERMAN COMMON SENSE 
THE NOSE FOR INSTANCE CAN BE RAISED UP WHEN YOU GET TO A SPEED BUMP AND THERE'S MORE 
INSIDE A LOT OF THE EQUIPMENT THE SAT NAV THE AIR CON THE DIALS 
ALL COME FROM A A EIGHT SO THEY SORT OF WORK 
I REMEMBER THE AIR CONDITIONING IN LAMBOS OF OLD USED TO BE AN ASTHMATIC SITTING IN THE DASHBOARD 
BLOWING AT YOU THROUGH A STRAW 
THAT DIDN'T WORK 
BUT MY ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE THING ABOUT THIS CAR IS THE WAY IT LOOKS 
HOOD DOWN OR HOOD UP IT IS DESPERATELY PRETTY 
AND IT'S TINY 
IT'S THE SAME LENGTH AS A FORD FOCUS WHICH MEANS IT'S EASY TO PARK 
AND EASY TO DRIVE IN TOWN 
WHAT WE HAVE HERE THEN IS NOT BY ANY MEANS THE BEST DRIVER'S CAR IN THE WORLD 
BUT YOU COULD USE IT EVERY DAY IF YOU WANTED TO 
AND IT HAS THE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC THAT I LOOK FOR IN A CAR IT'S A LAUGH 
YOU DRIVE A FERRARI WITH A RATHER SERIOUS EXPRESSION ON YOUR FACE 
YOU DRIVE ONE OF THESE GIRNING LIKE YOU MAY TECHNICALLY BE AN IDIOT 
AH 
I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY TREMENDOUS 
I KNOW IT'S NO LONGER A ROD STEWART MOBILE 
NO 
YOU UH 
YOU LIKED IT THEN 
I ADORED IT IT'S THE LUNACY I LOVE MOST OF ALL 
SOME CARS HAVE SPOILERS ON THE BACK THAT COME UP AT A CERTAIN SPEED 
THEY'VE ALL GOT A BUTTON SOMEWHERE INSIDE SO YOU CAN OVER RIDE IT 
YOU CAN PUT IT UP WHEN YOU WANT IT THIS DOESN'T 
THAT SPOILER COMES UP AT EIGHTY WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT 
SO IT MIGHT AS WELL HOIST A FLAG ON THE BACK THAT SAYS I'M SPEEDING EXACTLY 
AND NOW WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUT HOW FAST THIS GOES ROUND OUR TRACK 
THAT OF COURSE MEANS HANDING IT OVER TO OUR TAME RACING DRIVER 
SOME SAY THAT ON REALLY WARM DAYS HE SHEDS HIS SKIN LIKE A SNAKE 
AND THAT FOR SOME REASON HE'S ALLERGIC TO THE DUTCH 
ALL WE KNOW IS HE'S CALLED THE STIG 
AND HE'S OFF LITTLE PLUMES OF TYRE SMOKE THERE BUT THE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE SOON GOT THAT REINED IN 
HERE'S THE FIRST CORNER 
LOOK HOW KEENLY IT TURNS IN AND NOW HE'S BACK ON THE POWER 
LISTEN TO THAT 
IS IT DANGEROUS 
STIG'S STILL LEARNING GREEK IT SEEMS 
NOT A BIT OF IT LOADS OF GRIP AND THAT V. TEN THUNDER 
WHAT A LOVELY DRIFT ON THE WAY OUT 
I'VE LOST MY PURSE 
FOLLOW THROUGH NOW 
OH HE'S HAVING TO GIVE IT A FLICK OF OPPOSITE TORQUE NOW 
TWO CORNERS LEFT 
OH HE VEERS INTO THAT ONE HE'S VERY COMMITTED THROUGH THERE 
HARD ON THE BRAKES SHOVING IT INTO GAMBON 
AND ACROSS THE LINE YUP 
YUP 
IT DID IT IN ONE MINUTE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN SECONDS 
SO IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'D CALL THE FASTEST SUPER CAR IN THE WORLD 
BUT I HAVE TO SAY IT IS MY NEW FAVOURITE 
AND NOW IT'S TIME TO PUT A STAR IN OUR REASONABLY PRICED CAR 
NOW MY GUEST TONIGHT ONCE WENT ROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS 
I HOPE HE'S FASTER THAN THAT ON OUR TRACK 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PLEASE WELCOME STEVE COOGAN 
SINCE YOU WERE LAST HERE YOU'VE BECOME THE BIG HOLLYWOOD STAR 
NOT REALLY NO 
WELL YES 
I'VE TRIED YOU HAVE APPEARED IN A NUMBER OF HOLLYWOOD FILMS YEAH 
CLEESE KNEW THIS'D HAPPEN WHAT DID JOHN CLEESE ONCE SAY TO YOU YES 
I DID A FILM WITH UM JOHN CLEESE AND TERRY JONES 
IT WAS CALLED WIND IN THE WILLOWS AT THE TIME I HAD A RED FERRARI 
MAGNUM P. I. STYLE 
UM HENCE THE SHIRT 
AND JOHN CLEESE SAW ME DRIVING OFF IN IT 
AND HE SAID TO THE PRODUCER HE WENT WHO WAS DRIVING THAT FERRARI 
HE WENT THAT'S STEVE COOGAN 
HE'S A VERY VERY TALENTED YOUNG MAN ISN'T HE 
I DO HOPE HE GETS CANCER 
I'M QUITE ENVIOUS OF HOW YOUR LIFE'S TURNED OUT TO BE BRUTALLY HONEST 
BECAUSE EVERYTHING YOU EVER DO SEEMS TO TURN TO GOLD UM I'VE HAD A FEW MISSES 
YOU HAVE A NICE TIME WHILE HAVING THE MISSES WHEN I DID AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS THERE WAS A SCENE 
IN A JACUZZI I WAS BETWEEN JACKIE CHAN AND ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER IN A CHAN SCHWARZENEGGER SANDWICH 
AND I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS MY SMALL TALK I SAID ARE YOU STILL DRIVING YOUR HUMMER ARNOLD 
YES I HAVE FIVE 
HE SAID ONE IS EX MILITARY STRIPPED OUT 
I LIKE TO DRIVE IT ROUND L. A. WITH MY CIGAR 
HOW DOES THE CONVERSATION GO TO END UP IN A HOT TUB WITH YOU 
GET IN THE HOT TUB WITH ME STEVE 
IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT YEAH 
YOU'RE EASILY PLEASED AREN'T YOU ANYWAY SAXONDALE'S YOUR NEW SERIES THIS IS A CHARACTER WHO IS 
HE'S A FIFTY YEAR OLD EX ROADIE TURNED PEST CONTROLLER 
THERE'S A LOT OF THEM AROUND 
THE THING IS I WAS WATCHING THE SECOND EPISODE 
WHEN YOUR MAN SAXONDALE GOES TO SEE A MOTORING JOURNALIST 
H. M. M. SHALL WE HAVE A LOOK AT A LITTLE CLIP OF THAT 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THIS O. K. 
HI PEST CONTROL FOR THE MICE 
THE VERY SAME 
EXCELLENT SHIMMY ON IN THEN GENTS 
CAN I JUST HALT PROCEEDINGS TO DOFF THE PROVERBIAL TO THE GUV'NOR RE THE WHEELS 
R. E. S. P. E. C. T. 
YEAH RESPECT 
ARE YOU AN AFICIONADO GOT A MUSTANG IN THE DRIVE SHELBY 
I WISH NO BOSS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE 
SEVENTY TWO TWEAKED FLOORING THE GAS ON A TWEAKED THREE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE YOU'LL STILL PUT YOUR BOWELS IN YOUR BACK POCKET 
TELL ME ABOUT IT SHALL WE HUNT SOME RODENT THEN GENTS 
THERE HE GOES 
WELL WHO'S THAT THEN 
HE'S CALLED JEROME WILSON 
SO 
SO SOMEONE POINTED OUT TO ME AFTERWARDS THAT IT REMINDED HIM A BIT OF YOU WHICH IS PURE COINCIDENCE 
I'M VERY FLATTERED AND HONOURED I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU TO DO IT 
I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU TO BE IN IT AS YOURSELF 
BUT THEN I THOUGHT I COULDN'T QUITE STICK THE KNIFE IN IF IT WAS YOU 
IT'S GONE IN NICE AND DEEP BECAUSE IT DOES END UP WITH BIT OF A DICK ISN'T HE 
IT'S HOW THAT SERIES ENDS YOU CAN ONLY SATIRISE SOMETHING IF YOU TRULY LOVE IT WELL NO 
BECAUSE MY WIFE WATCHED IT AND WHEN IT GOT TO THE BIT WHERE I'M A BIT OF A DICK SHE WAS GOING YEAH YEAH 
ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT THE WAY YOU WRITE STUFF 
IS HOW MUCH ATTENTION TO DETAIL YOU PUT INTO IT 
PARTICULARLY THE CARS 
GARETH CHEESEMAN HAD THE PROBE 
PARTRIDGE HAD THE WELL THE ROVER AND THEN THE LEXUS BOTH SPOT ON FOR HIM 
AND NOW SAXONDALE HAS GOT THE MUSTANG 
I MEAN THAT'S JUST A BRILLIANT PIECE OF CASTING 
WELL I WAS VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT IT 
THIS IS WHERE WE GET REALLY ANAL ABOUT CARS 
BUT I DIDN'T WANT THE G. T. FASTBACK MUSTANG FROM BULLITT 
NO THAT STEVE MCQUEEN DROVE IT'S TOO COOL THE THREE HUNDRED NINETY THAT'S RIGHT 
GOOD WELL DONE 
SO UM 
I WANTED THE BOSS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE 
THAT'S THE BOND ONE FROM IT'S THE ONE FROM DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER 
THAT GOES SIDEWAYS ON ITS SIDE WHEELS THROUGH THAT ALLEYWAY BUT THERE'S A CONTINUITY ERROR IN IT 
THERE IS AND THERE ISN'T 
I KNOW ABOUT THIS GO ON THEN O. K. 
WHEN THEY DID THE JAMES BOND FILM DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER THERE IS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS MISTAKES ON FILM 
THE CAR GOES THROUGH ON ITS WHEELS THAT WAY LIKE THAT 
THEN WHEN IT COMES OUT OF THE ALLEY IT'S THE OTHER WAY ROUND YEAH 
SO WHAT THEY DO IS THEY PUT IN A SHOT IN THE MIDDLE 
WITH HIM DRIVING ALONG SUDDENLY YOU SEE THEM IN THE CAR AND IT GOES 
AS IF SOMEHOW 
IF IT COULD DO THAT IT COULD DRIVE THROUGH THE GAP NORMALLY 
THAT WAS MY FAVOURITE BIT YOU CAN SEE THEM IN THE EDIT GOING OH DEAR OH NO 
I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT THIS IS REALLY I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT FLIP THE IMAGE 
BUT WHEN HE DRIVES OUT THERE'S LOTS OF SIGNS IT'S LAS VEGAS 
AND ALL THE SIGNS WOULD BE BACKWARDS SO 
CAN I GIVE YOU A REALLY ANAL ONE ON THAT YOU'LL LIKE THIS 
CAR ADVERTS THAT ARE RUN ALL ROUND THE WORLD ONE OF THE NUMBER PLATES IS YHY ONE HUNDRED ONE 
IT'S SO THAT WHEN THEY FLIP IT TO MAKE IT LEFT OR RIGHT HAND DRIVE THE NUMBER PLATE STILL MAKES SENSE 
I LIKE THAT FACT 
I MIGHT USE THAT A DINNER PARTY WHEN THERE'S AN AWKWARD PAUSE YES 
I DO 
AND THEN THE PAUSE IS EVEN LONGER 
NOW THE LAP OH GOD 
WHAT'S REALLY FUNNY O. K. IS ROB BRYDON WHO'S YOUR PROTEGE REALLY I KNOW 
HE HAS THE MOST WRETCHED CAR HISTORY OF ANYONE WHO'S BEEN ON THE SHOW 
HIS HIGHLIGHT WAS HIS CAVALIER AND HE LIKED IT 
AND HE WAS FASTER THAN YOU I KNOW 
THAT WAS PROBABLY THE WORST MOMENT IN MY LIFE ACTUALLY 
AND MY BUILDER CAME ROUND TO MY HOUSE AND TOLD ME 
YOUR MATE ROB BRYDON HE WIPED THE FLOOR WITH YOU 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE WAS FASTER NO AND I RANG HIM AND HE NEVER LETS ME FORGET THAT 
WHEN I SEE HIM HE SAYS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER STEVE BUT I WAS SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN YOU 
SO LAP 
HOW DID IT GO TODAY WITH THE NEW REASONABLY PRICED CAR 
I ER 
SOMEONE SAID TO ME ACTUALLY THE STIG SAID TO ME 
THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE SPORTSMEN AND WHO ARE LIKE TECHNICAL PEOPLE 
TEND TO DO BETTER BECAUSE THEY LISTEN MORE 
I'M MORE A SORT OF LET ME JUST GO SO I'M PROBABLY NOT THE MOST DISCIPLINED 
THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF THAT ON ONE OF YOUR PRACTICE LAPS WHO'D LIKE TO SEE THAT YES 
LET'S RUN THE TAPE 
YOU'VE GOT YOUR TAIL OUT NEARLY HELD IT AND THEN OH DEAR 
SOFT SUSPENSION 
VERY GOOD 
IT WAS QUITE ENJOYABLE ACTUALLY SHALL WE SEE YOUR LAP 
YEAH GO ON WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THAT YEAH PLAY THE TAPE 
AND WE'RE OFF 
PLEASE LET ME BE BETTER THAN ROB BRYDON PLEASE 
YOU CUT THAT CORNER AND IT SKIDDED BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER THAT'S WHAT IT DOES 
NICE AND TIGHT THROUGH THERE I LIKE THAT 
MY SECOND A BIT COARSE THERE 
SUDDENLY ALAN PARTRIDGE HAS TAKEN OVER THE WHEEL THERE 
IT WASN'T REALLY A COMIC CREATION IT WAS YOU 
GO FASTER 
THERE'S A LOT OF STARING AT THE GEAR LEVER 
BRIAN COX WAS STARING AT IT IN THE HOPE THAT OOH 
THAT WAS VIOLENT TWO TURNINGS FOR THAT CORNER IN A ROW 
NICE AND BRAVE KEPT IT ON THERE NICELY USING THAT TO KEEP THE TAIL OUT 
AND THERE WE ARE ACROSS THE LINE 
WHERE DO YOU RECKON THEN 
I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT I'M ABOVE MICHAEL GAMBON 
CAN I JUST BE HONEST WITH YOU GO ON 
THE STIG THINKS THAT THE HEAT MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO YOU 
OR THE CAR OR THE TRACK OR SOMETHING 
COS HE WAS VERY FLATTERING ABOUT YOUR DRIVING HE SAID YOU WERE VERY GOOD COMPETENT LATE BREAKING 
AGGRESSIVE ALL THE RIGHT THINGS 
BUT NOT Q. L. I. K. 
TO BE BRUTAL 
ONE MINUTE FIVE HUNDRED NINE SECONDS 
SO IT'S THERE BUT GIVE HIM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO 
THE FIRST ONE EVER HOT 
THAT'S NOT THE LAP THAT'S THE TEMPERATURE DO YOU WANT TO KNOW THE REALLY BAD THING 
ROB BRYDON 
IN THE OLD LESS POWERFUL CAR 
WAS QUICKER 
IT'S STILL SLOWER THAN ROB YEAH 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO STAY THE NIGHT HERE 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN STEVE COOGAN 
NOW 
IN THE OLDEN DAYS IF YOU WANTED A GREAT SMALL CAR 
YOU COULDN'T DO MUCH BETTER THAN BUY A SMALL PEUGEOT 
BUT IN RECENT YEARS THEY SEEM TO HAVE LOST THE PLOT 
TAKE THE TWO HUNDRED SIX YOU'D ONLY HAVE BOUGHT ONE BECAUSE IT WAS MADE IN BRITAIN 
BUT NOW THEY'VE CLOSED THE FACTORY IN COVENTRY AND IT'S GOING TO BE MADE IN TURKMENISTAN OR SOMEWHERE 
SO NOW IT'S GOING TO BE A BAD CAR MADE BADLY 
BUT PEUGEOT HAVE LAUNCHED A NEW SMALL CAR AND I'VE BEEN DRIVING IT 
HERE IT IS IT'S CALLED THE TWO HUNDRED SEVEN 
AND IT'S PEUGEOT'S BIGGEST SMALL CAR YET 
AS WE CAN SEE IT'S A VERY PRETTY CAR 
BUT IS IT ANY GOOD 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK ON THE INSIDE IT'S GOT AN IPOD CONNECTOR SAT NAV AND RADIO 
AND IT'S BEAUTIFULLY LIT BY THIS CALIFORNIAN ARCHITECT'S SUN ROOF 
HOWEVER IT STILL LOOKS A BIT LIKE THE INSIDE OF JACQUES COUSTEAU'S WETSUIT 
IT'S ALSO GOT THIS A BUILT IN AIR FRESHENER 
IT'S WANG CHUNG OR JOJOBA OIL 
SO YOU GET MORE SPACE AND MORE TOYS 
BUT YOU HAVE TO PART WITH MORE MONEY 
THIS ONE IS THE SIXTEEN DIESEL 
AND IT COSTS ALMOST FIFTEEN THOUSAND WHICH IS A LOT OF MONEY FOR A SMALL CAR 
EVEN IF IT IS QUITE A BIG ONE 
TO SEE IF IT'S WORTH IT I'M GOING TO TEST THIS GINORMOUS CITY CAR 
ON THE STREETS OF LIVERPOOL 
TO SPUR ME ON A BIT I'M GOING TO HAVE A RACE 
AND IT'S AGAINST THE LATEST FRENCH DEVELOPMENT IN URBAN TRANSPORT YOUNG MEN IN SILLY TROUSERS 
ARE YOU READY 
THREE POINT ONE GO 
THESE ARE NOT JUST ANY YOUNG MEN 
THEY ARE MASTERS OF SOMETHING CALLED PARKOUR 
IT'S A FRENCH INVENTION AND INVOLVES THAT SORT OF THING 
RUNNING AROUND THE CITY LEAPING ACROSS BUILDINGS AND BENCHES 
KEEPS THEM OFF THE STREET 
OUR RACE WILL RUN FROM THE EDGE OF LIVERPOOL TO THE FINISH LINE AT THE LIVER BUILDING 
FOR ME IT'LL BE ABOUT SIX MILES 
THEIR JOURNEY IS PRETTY MUCH AS THE CROW FLIES 
WHAT AM I DOING TWENTY FIVE M. P. H. 
THEY'LL HAVE DIFFICULTY MATCHING THAT 
SO THE CAR IT HAS A NICE DRIVING POSITION 
THE STEERING'S NICE AND WEIGHTY AND THE SEAT IS EXCELLENT 
AND THERE'S QUITE A BIT MORE ROOM THAN IN THE OLD ONE 
BUT THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT YOU FEEL ON THE CITY STREETS 
BECAUSE THE TWO HUNDRED SEVEN IS BIGGER AND HAS MORE GIZMOS AND SAFETY 
IT'S ALMOST THREE HUNDRED POUNDS HEAVIER THAN THE OLD CAR 
AND YET IT STILL HAS TO HAUL ITSELF AROUND WITH THE SAME ENGINE AS THE TWO HUNDRED SIX 
THE CAR I'M IN HAS A SIXTEEN DIESEL 
THE BEST OF THE CURRENT RANGE 
BUT IT'S NOT GREAT IT'S SLUGGISH AND THAT'S ANNOYING 
WE'REOFF 
NOT ONLY WERE THE SCOUSE SPIDER MEN UNSTOPPABLE THEY ALSO KNEW WHERE THEY WERE GOING 
WHICH I DIDN'T 
EXCUSE ME SIR DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE LIVER BUILDING IS 
NO THE LIEVER BUILDING 
WHY ISN'T IT CALLED LIEVERPOOL THEN WELL 
THERE THEY ARE THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'VE NICKED SOMETHING 
BUT I DIDN'T CATCH THEM FOR LONG 
PLEASE 
MEANWHILE THE AIR FRESHENER DEVICE WAS GETTING UP MY NOSE 
YOU BUY A BRAND NEW CAR AND THEY IMMEDIATELY MAKE IT SMELL LIKE A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD MINI CAB 
COME ON WE'RE NOT ALL SHOPPING 
I HAD JUST TWO MILES TO GO IN THE SLUGGISH PEUGEOT 
I'M NOT GOING TO BE BEATEN BY SOME PRE PUBESCENT TEENAGERS 
IN CAMOUFLAGE TROUSERS 
I MUST HAVE AVERAGED TEN TO TWELVE M. P. H. I SHOULD WIN 
GO GO GO 
I WAS CLOSE BUT SO WERE THEY 
COME ON 
THAT MUST BE THE LIVER BUILDING 
AND THEY'RE NOT HERE THEY ARE NOT HERE 
NO SIGN OF COMBAT TROUSERS MAN 
THAT IS A VICTORY FOR BEER GUTS OVER WASHBOARD STOMACHS 
FASHIONABLE CLOTHES FROM ARMY SURPLUS SHOPS STUPID EXPENSIVE TRAINERS 
HERE I AM IN MY TATTY JEANS AND I'VE WON 
OH FOR PETE'S SAKE 
SO YOU LOST BUT I DON'T MIND BECAUSE I THINK THOSE BLOKES ARE AMAZING WHAT ABOUT THE CAR 
THAT'S NOT SO AMAZING IT'S TOO BIG AND HEAVY IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE 
ALL OF THOSE BLOKES WHO WERE FIRED FROM THE COVENTRY FACTORY YES THEY WANTED TO DO AN ANTI PEUGEOT AD 
TO PROTEST AT HOW THEY HAD BEEN TREATED YES 
I CAN THINK OF A BETTER REASON FOR NOT BUYING ONE WHAT IT'S RUBBISH 
NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A VERY SPECIAL RACE AT THE KNOCKHILL CIRCUIT IN SCOTLAND 
TWO TEAMS THE STIG ON ONE AND RICHARD JAMES AND ME ON THE OTHER 
THE CARS WE ARE USING ARE CATERHAMS WHICH ARE KIT CARS 
AND WHAT MAKES THE RACE SPECIAL IS THAT THE WINNER ISN'T THE FIRST TO FINISH BUT THE FIRST TO START 
LET ME EXPLAIN 
AT PRECISELY NINE A M. THE STIG WILL LEAVE THE CATERHAM FACTORY HERE 
AND HE WILL DRIVE TO SCOTLAND 
MEANWHILE WE WILL START HERE AT THE TRACK 
IT SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE A BIG ADVANTAGE BUT BEFORE WE SET OFF WE HAVE TO BUILD OUR CAR FROM SCRATCH 
SO CAN WE DO THAT FASTER THAN THE STIG CAN DRIVE TO SCOTLAND 
THERE IS A SERIOUS POINT TO THIS 
WHICH IS HOW HARD CAN IT BE TO BUILD A KIT CAR 
WELL AS IT TURNS OUT VERY COS ALL YOU DID ALL DAY WAS SHOUT AT JEREMY 
AND ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS STICK A SCREWDRIVER IN THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD YOU WOULDN'T LOOK AT THE DIAGRAM 
YOU SPENT EIGHT HOURS CARESSING EVERY SINGLE BOLT BEFORE PUTTING IT ON THE CAR 
YOU'D HAVE PUT EVERY PIECE ON UPSIDE DOWN COS YOU WON'T LISTEN STOP ARGUING AND JUST LOOK AT THE FILM 
RIGHT IT'S TEN TO NINE AND WE'RE IN ONE OF THE PIT GARAGES AT THE KNOCKHILL CIRCUIT 
AND HERE'S OUR CAR 
WHILE WE'RE BUILDING OUR CAR WE HAVE THIS SATELLITE TRACKING SYSTEM 
WHICH WE CAN USE TO MONITOR THE STIG'S PROGRESS 
HE'S AT THE CATERHAM FACTORY IN SURREY 
WE'VE GOT THE ENGINE THE GEARBOX THE DRIVE SHAFT 
THE BODYWORK MAJOR SUSPENSION COMPONENTS RADIATOR INTERIOR TRIM AND WIRING TO DO 
OF COURSE WE ARE IDEALLY SUITED FOR THE JOB IN HAND 
I TRAINED AS A LOCAL NEWSPAPER REPORTER HAMMOND TRAINED AS A RADIO D. J. AND MAY TRAINED AS A PIANIST 
HE'S OFF HE'S MOVED 
THE PIANIST HAD APPOINTED HIMSELF AS PROJECT LEADER 
AND INSISTED WE ALL READ THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL 
WE'VE ONLY GOT EIGHT HOURS I CAN'T READ THAT DON'T NEED THAT 
THE STIG HAD FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILES TO COVER AND WAS A MAN ON A MISSION 
JAMES HOWEVER WASN'T 
SPACER BUSH THREE SLASH EIGHTS INTERNAL DIAMETER 
HALF AN INCH INSIDE DIAMETER 
FROM THE REAR MOUNT USING BOLTS THREE INSERTED FROM THE FRONT OF THE MOUNTING 
YES OR NO 
YOU HAVE TO BE FASTER SPEED IS WHAT MATTERS SERIOUSLY 
GUESS AND GO FAST SHUT UP JEREMY 
LUCKILY WE DID HAVE ONE ADVANTAGE 
THE STIG HAD REFUSED TO GO ROUND THE M. TWENTY FIVE AND WAS PLOUGHING STRAIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF LONDON 
AT RUSH HOUR 
WHY IS HE DOING THAT I AM GOING AS THE CROW FLIES I AM STIG STRAIGHT LINE I WILL NOT DEVIATE 
WHILE HE'S STOPPED WE WORK LIKE MAD MEN 
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT HOW TO BUILD A CAR 
IT'S BROKEN DON'T HIT IT WITH THE HAMMER WHY IT'S THE TOOL OF A PIKEY 
SO IF YOU BUY IT IN THIS STATE AND BUILD IT YOURSELF IT'S FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
IF YOU BUY IT READY MADE LIKE THE STIG'S IT'S TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MORE 
THINK OF THE FUN OF ASSEMBLY IT'S NOT FUN TO DO THIS YOUR WIFE'S IN BED WITH THE MILKMAN 
AND YOU'RE WHERE'S MY FRONT SUSPENSION UNIT 
IT TOOK THE STIG NINETY MINUTES TO GET ACROSS SOUTH LONDON 
I THINK HE'S CROSSING THE RIVER THAMES 
AND WE HAD USED THE TIME WELL 
ONE HOURS THE REAR SUSPENSION IS ON 
REAR BRAKES DRIVE SHAFT EVERYTHING DONE THERE 
UP FRONT THIS CORNER A MAGNIFICENT ACHIEVEMENT 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
WE HAVE TO CLAMP THE STEERING BACK DOWN OH I KNEW THAT 
JAMES CAN I START ON THE INTERIOR I THINK THAT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA I'LL GET A HAMMER 
SO WHILE JAMES AND RICHARD BUSY THEMSELVES WITH THE STEERING I TACKLE THE SEATS 
THEY HADN'T LINED THEM UP IN THE FACTORY BUT I HAVE BRILLIANTLY 
THE STIG WAS NOW ON THE M. FORTY AND HAD THE HAMMER DOWN 
I TOO HAD PUT MY HAMMER DOWN AND PICKED UP A SPANNER SOMETHING WAS BOUND TO GO WRONG 
HOW DID I DO THAT YOU DID IT COS YOU DIDN'T LOOK AND BUMPED IT IN 
HAVE I GOT TO TAKE IT OUT AGAIN YOU HAVE LET'S THINK ABOUT IT 
NO MATTER THE STIG WAS STILL FOUR HUNDRED MILES AWAY AND COMING TO A HALT AGAIN 
THIS TIME AT THE OXFORD SERVICES 
HE'S AT OXFORD AND WE'RE PUTTING THE ENGINE IN VICTORY IS OURS 
MEANWHILE DOWN IN OXFORD THE STIG WAS REVEALING SOMETHING NEW ABOUT HIMSELF 
HE HAS A BLADDER 
UM WHAT ENGINE 
HELLO STIG SIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN 
YOU'VE GOT TO GET THIS ROUND NO 
WHERE'S THE STIG 
WHOSE FAULT WAS THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP IS IT 
HOW STRONG ARE BRAKE DISCS PRETTY STRONG 
ARE THEY STRONG ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND A CAR NO 
YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS UNDERNEATH AND I SAID CAN IT FALL OFF ITS THINGS 
AND YOU SAID NO AND WHAT A SHAME IT DIDN'T 
QUICKLY I'M GOING TO DROP THE CAR YOU'RE ALL RIGHT 
THERE YOU GO EVERYBODY'S HAPPY 
THE STIG WAS NEARING BIRMINGHAM WE HAD LOST TIME AND OUR ENGINE STILL WOULDN'T GO IN 
YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS BECAUSE THE GARAGE IS ALL ON A SLOPE 
WE REALLY NEED THE CAR POINTING THAT WAY 
WE HAVEN'T GOT TIME WE HAVE TO MOVE THE ENGINE OUT TURN THE CAR ROUND MOVE THE JACKS 
HE'S ABOUT TO GET ON TO THE M. FORTY TWO SERIOUSLY 
ANNOYINGLY THE PIANIST WAS RIGHT 
JAMES TELL ME WHAT TO DO AND I'LL PUSH IT DOWN 
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE BIG HEAVY ENGINE AND THE SMALL GUY HOLDING IT 
YOU NEED TO STOP WHEN I SAY 
JAMES LOOK AT THE MAP BEHIND YOU I KNOW JEREMY SHOULD WE JUST LIE IT ON THE TOP CAN WE NOT BICKER 
JIGGLE IT I'M JIGGLING LIKE A BUGGER 
NOW YOU CAN GO DOWN 
OH JEREMY 
YOU JUST DROPPED IT THROUGH THE BLOODY CAR 
HE IS TWO HUNDRED NINETY NINE MILES AWAY 
AT STIG SPEEDS THAT COULD BE AN HOUR 
JEREMY WAS SACKED FROM ENGINE MANAGEMENT 
AND JAMES AND I DID IT OURSELVES 
IT'S IN YES 
START IT UP IT'S NOT THAT IN 
ALL THE BRAKES HAVE TO BE CONNECTED UP BRAKES ANCILLARIES ANCILLARIES BATTERY BATTERY 
THROTTLE LINKAGE THROTTLE LINKAGE CLUTCH CLUTCH GEARS GEARS QUITE A LOT IF WE'RE HONEST 
DURING OUR ENGINE FITTING CALAMITY THE STIG HAD MADE UP ALL THE TIME HE'D LOST IN LONDON 
WE WERE NOW ON THE BACK FOOT 
A LITTLE LESS CONVERSATION A LITTLE MORE ACTION PLEASE 
HAMMER NO 
A LITTLE MORE BITE A LITTLE LESS BARK 
I HAVE TO ATTACH THIS BEFORE I CAN ATTACH SOMETHING ELSE HERE 
THAT MEANS I CAN THEN ATTACH THE ROLL BAR NO 
OH GOD 
LOOK AT THE PICTURE IT DOESN'T TELL ME ANYTHING IT DOES 
THEY MAY AS WELL HAVE PHOTOGRAPHED YOUR ARSE 
THE STIG HAD NOW COVERED TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILES AND WAS MAKING GOOD TIME 
THE ONLY BLESSING WAS HIS SMALL FUEL TANK 
I THINK HE'S STOPPED FOR FUEL 
HAS THE STIG EVER STOPPED FOR FUEL BEFORE 
HOW WILL HE PAY FOR IT 
YOU GOT A NECTAR CARD 
WHILE THE STIG WAS POWERING THROUGH THE LAKE DISTRICT JEREMY WAS ATTACHING THE STEERING WHEEL 
BROKEN 
AND THEN HE HAD HIS SECOND GO AT FITTING THE SEATS 
BORED BORED BORED BORED BORED BORED BORING 
DULL TEDIOUS ANNOYING BACK ACHE ARM ACHE 
CRAMP MISERABLE HATE JAMES 
HOW FAR FROM SCOTLAND IS CARLISLE 
IT'S FINISHED NO IT WASN'T 
JEREMY BEFORE YOU GO ANY FURTHER CAN I MAKE A POINT 
YOU HAVE TO MOUNT THE HARNESS BEFORE YOU PUT THE SEATS IN YOU'RE JOKING 
EVERY SINGLE THING I DO IS RUBBISH 
YOU DON'T THINK ANYTHING THROUGH YOU JUST THINK THAT GOES THERE 
THIS IS THE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE EVER 
THE STIG HIT SCOTLAND HE WAS NOW JUST ONE HUNDRED MILES AWAY 
AND WE STILL HAD TO DO THE BRAKES THE BODYWORK AND THE ELECTRICS 
THANK GOD RICHARD AND I HAD TAKEN SOME SHORTCUTS 
I'M SAVING TIME BY NOT PUTTING WASHERS AND BOLTS ON BUT THESE ARE ALL REALLY IMPORTANT 
I KNOW JAMES WOULD FLIP IF HE KNEW 
PREDICTABLY THOUGH JAMES WAS BEING TOO ANAL TO NOTICE 
THAT'S ALL HE DOES HE FILES 
HE TAKES STUFF OUT AND THEN PUTS IT BACK WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE 
JAMES WHAT STOP FILING 
I'M LOOKING FOR THE SODDING SOCKET THING THAT YOU NEED DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS NO 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE YES 
WITH THE STIG PITTING FOR HIS FINAL SPLASH AND DASH 
WE HAD TO START BLEEDING THE BRAKES 
WHICH IT TURNED OUT IS A MINEFIELD OF DOUBLE ENTENDRES 
THE NIPPLE IS OFF THE TUBE IS IN THE HOLE I'LL BE NEEDING SOME PUMP 
WHERE IS HE WHY HAVE YOU GOT THAT HE'S GOING TOWARDS GLASGOW 
YOU SHOULD FEEL IT GO STIFF NOW PUMP MAN PUMP 
YEAH THAT'S MUCH BETTER THAT'S HARD 
THE STIG WAS NOW OFF THE MOTORWAY AND BEARING DOWN ON US 
A LIGHT IT BREATHES IT LIVES 
HAS HE CROSSED THE FORTH YET HE'S ABOUT TO NOW 
THAT MADE HIM JUST TWENTY MILES AWAY 
WE'VE GOT MINUTES COME ON 
PETROL 
GEAR KNOB ON IT WILL BE REQUIRED 
PRESS THE BUTTON 
IT LIVES IT'S DEAD 
IF THAT GOES ON WILL THIS CAR WORK 
FUEL PUMP'S WORKING 
WHY DID IT DO THAT 
FIVE MILES AWAY 
JUST LEAVE IT A MINUTE 
NOW 
I'M JUST GETTING RID OF TOOLS 
WHO'S DRIVING CAN YOU DO IT WITH THREE YES 
DO WE GO ON ONE OR THREE THREE TWO ONE GO 
THREE TWO ONE GO 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN PAPER WRAPS STONE YOU'RE DRIVING 
ENGINE DOESN'T START 
COME ON OH GOD 
ALL WE HAD TO DO TO WIN WAS CROSS THE START LINE 
THREE TWO ONE GO 
THAT'S ENOUGH WE WON 
WE HAD WON BUT HOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE STIG 
HE WAS RIGHT ON TOP OF US 
DOES THIS CAR BELONG TO YOU SIR 
CAN I ASK WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO 
CAN I ASK WHERE YOU'VE COME FROM 
HE WAS THREE MILES AWAY TEN MINUTES AGO 
IS THE CAR STOLEN SIR 
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT EVEN WITH TRAFFIC OR TROUBLE GETTING IN 
THE STIG RESERVED THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT 
SO PROOF THAT YOU CAN BUILD AN ENTIRE CAR IN EIGHT HOURS 
AND IT IS A GREAT THING TO DO 
IT'S NOT LIKE MENDING AN OLD CAR EVERYTHING IS CLEAN 
IT ALL GOES TOGETHER PERFECTLY IT'S A GREAT EXPERIENCE 
JAMES I WOULD RATHER STAPLE MY EARS TO A HORSE 
APART FROM THE FACT THAT YOU CHAFE YOUR KNUCKLES EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES THERE'S THE EXPENSE 
O. K. IT'S TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED LESS TO BUY THE CAR IN BITS BUT THEN YOU NEED TOOLS THERE'S THE DIVORCE SETTLEMENT 
AND WHAT DO YOU END UP WITH WOULD ANYONE HERE DRIVE A CAR I BUILT 
NO EXACTLY LET'S TAKE THIS ONE AS AN EXAMPLE 
THEY'VE PUT A LITTLE PLAQUE HERE DOWN AT CATERHAM 
THAT HAS RENDERED IT WORTHLESS 
AND ON THAT BOMBSHELL IT'S TIME TO END THANKS FOR WATCHING GOOD NIGHT
