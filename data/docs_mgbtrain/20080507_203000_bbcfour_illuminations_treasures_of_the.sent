THE MODERN DAY BOOK IS A COMMODITY REPRODUCED IN LARGE PRINT RUNS 
EACH TEXT IS AN OBJECT CLONED FOR MASS CONSUMPTION 
BUT ONCE UPON A TIME WHEN EVERY BOOK WAS UNIQUE AND HAND MADE 
THE WORD HAD AN AURA OF MAGIC AND POWER ABOUT IT 
FOR MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND YEARS ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS BROUGHT 
SCRIPTURES STORIES MYTHS AND LEGENDS TO LIFE 
IN THEIR GLITTERING PAGES ARE PRESERVED THE IDEAS 
THE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND THE MANY MYSTERIES OF THE MEDIEVAL AGE 
ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS FLOURISHED BETWEEN THE SIXTH AND THE SIXTEENTH CENTURIES 
AND WERE AMONG THE MOST PRECIOUS POSSESSIONS OF THE TIME 
THEY'RE NOW VALUABLE COLLECTORS' ITEMS MANY WORTH MILLIONS APIECE 
CAMBRIDGE CONTAINS ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST COLLECTIONS 
BUT BECAUSE IT'S DISPERSED AMONG THE UNIVERSITY'S MANY COLLEGES AND THE LIBRARY 
IT'S REMAINED UNTIL NOW SOMETHING OF A SECRET RESOURCE A GREAT HIDDEN MUSEUM OF THE PAINTED WORD 
BUT THE FITZWILLIAM HAS HAD THE BIG IDEA OF BRINGING TOGETHER THE VERY BEST OF THE BOOKS IN CAMBRIDGE 
AND PUTTING THEM INTO A SINGLE EXHIBITION 
IT IS LITERALLY A BRILLIANT EXHIBITION BRILLIANT IN THE SENSE 
THAT GOLD GLEAMS OFF EVERY ONE OF THESE PAGES AND LOOKING AT IT IS BREATHTAKING 
LIKE LOOKING THROUGH A THOUSAND WINDOWS ONTO A WORLD THAT'S GONE FOREVER 
THE REASON WHY MANUSCRIPTS ARE IMPORTANT IS THAT THEY CONTAIN MOST OF WHAT SURVIVES 
OF THE ART AND THE CULTURE OF EUROPE 
FOR THE BEST PART OF A THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
THEY CONTAIN THE FINEST EXAMPLES OF MEDIEVAL ART BECAUSE MOST PAINTING OF THE MIDDLE AGES HAS BEEN LOST 
FRESCOES HAVE FADED OR CRUMBLED THE TAPESTRIES HARDLY EXIST 
WITHOUT THE MANUSCRIPT BOOK WE WOULD KNOW NOTHING OF PLATO OR ARISTOTLE 
WE WOULD KNOW NOTHING OF JESUS OR MOHAMMED OR AT LEAST VERY LITTLE 
WE'D KNOW NOTHING OF THE BATTLE OF HASTINGS 
OF THE DEATH OF THOMAS BECKET 
BECAUSE MEDIEVAL MANUSCRIPT ARE SO EXTRAORDINARILY PRECIOUS 
THEY ARE ALSO VERY VULNERABLE 
AND THIS MAKES THEIR STUDY QUITE DIFFICULT 
IN THE END SEEING THEM IN AN EXHIBITION CASE 
LIKE BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLIES PINNED UP AS SPECIMENS IS ONE THING 
ACTUALLY TO EXPERIENCE THE BOOK IS TO OPEN IT AND TO TURN THE PAGES 
AND TO SEE THE FLASH OF GOLD AND THE GLIMMER OF COLOUR 
AND EVEN TO SMELL IT I MEAN BOOKS ARE MADE OF ANIMAL SKIN THEY'RE WONDERFULLY FRAGRANT THINGS 
CALFSKIN OR VELLUM AS IT'S KNOWN WAS INTRODUCED IN THE FOURTH CENTURY AD 
BEFORE THEN MANUSCRIPTS A WORD WHICH LITERALLY MEANS WRITTEN BY HAND 
WERE MADE FROM STONE CLAY AND LATER PAPYRUS SCROLLS 
BUT CLAY WAS HEAVY AND SCROLLS WERE UNWIELDY 
SO IN THE FOURTH CENTURY THE RECTANGULAR FORMAT KNOWN AS THE CODEX EMERGED 
THE BOOK AS WE KNOW IT NOW WAS BORN 
WITHIN TWO HUNDRED YEARS MONKS IN ITALY BEGAN TO ILLUSTRATE THEIR BOOKS 
THE MONASTIC WAY OF LIFE IN WHICH MEN AND WOMEN REMOVE THEMSELVES FROM THE WORLD TO PRAY 
AND MEDITATE HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED IN EARLY CHRISTIAN TIMES 
BUT IN THE SIXTH CENTURY THE ROMAN CLERIC BENEDICT OF NURSIA 
GAVE THE PRACTICE A WHOLE NEW IMPETUS BY DEVELOPING THE INSTITUTION OF THE MONASTERY 
MONKS WERE EXPECTED TO BECOME FULLY ACQUAINTED WITH SCRIPTURE 
BUT BENEDICT STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF WORK AS MUCH AS PRAYER 
AS A CONSEQUENCE BENEDICT'S MONASTERIES 
BECAME CENTRES WHERE CHERISHED BOOKS WERE LOVINGLY MADE AS WELL AS READ 
IN SAINT BENEDICT'S TIME PEOPLE WOULD SPEND HOURS OF THE DAY READING SCRIPTURE VERY SLOWLY 
AND OF COURSE THAT'S WHERE ALL THE WORK OF THE MEDIEVAL MANUSCRIPTS 
AND ILLUMINATIONS ACTUALLY GROWS OUT OF THAT TRADITION 
IT'S FROM THAT VERY SLOW CAREFUL READING THAT 
THE TRADITION WHICH PRODUCED ALL THE ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPT GROWS BECAUSE IT'S FALLING IN LOVE WITH THE TEXT 
IT'S GIVING IT SO MUCH ATTENTION IN REPRODUCING IT AND COPYING IT 
THAT YOU START TO ELABORATE IT DECORATE IT 
AND YOU ALLOW YOUR LIFE TO FLOW INTO IT 
BY THE SIXTH CENTURY BENEDICTINE MONASTERIES WERE ESTABLISHED ACROSS EUROPE 
THE MONKS WHO'D BEEN SCRIBES AND ILLUMINATORS ALSO BECAME MISSIONARIES 
THEY WERE SPREADING THE WORD AND THE IMAGE OF GOD 
ENGLAND WAS THEN IN WHAT WE WOULD CALL THE DARK AGES THEY WERE PAGAN 
THE ROMANS BEGAN A KIND OF MOVEMENT OF EVANGELISM INTO NORTHERN EUROPE FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IT'S A KIND OF NEW ROMAN EMPIRE A CHRISTIAN EMPIRE 
IN THE YEAR FIVE HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN THE CHURCH OF ROME ARMED A MONK 
WITH A LAVISHLY ILLUMINATED SET OF GOSPELS AND DISPATCHED HIM TO ENGLAND 
THAT MONK WAS TO BECOME SAINT AUGUSTINE AND HIS MANUAL OF SALVATION 
WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN ENGLAND'S CONVERSION TO CHRISTIANITY 
IT CONTAINS FOUR OR ORIGINALLY CONTAINED A PICTURE OF EACH OF THE FOUR WRITERS OF THE GOSPELS 
MATTHEW MARK LUKE AND JOHN TOGETHER WITH A SERIES OF ALMOST 
COMIC BOOK PICTURES OF SCENES THAT WERE UNIQUE TO EACH OF THE GOSPELS 
WE THINK OF THE COMIC STRIP AS SOMETHING THAT WAS INVENTED 
AROUND NINETEEN HUNDRED WITH THE INVENTION OF THE COMIC AND THE ANNUAL AND THAT SORT OF THING WELL IN FACT NOT 
THERE'S A WHOLE HONOURABLE HISTORY OF THE COMIC STRIP 
THE STORIES THE BIBLICAL STORIES HOW WILL YOU MAKE THEM CLEAR TO PEOPLE WHO CAN'T READ 
YOU CREATE A COMIC STRIP 
THIS IS THE EARLIEST SURVIVING PICTURE OF THE LAST SUPPER TAKING PLACE 
THE CUP THAT CHRIST IS HOLDING OF COURSE IS THE HOLY GRAIL AND THEY'RE SEATED AT A ROUND TABLE 
IT'S A VERY ODD THING 
AND I WONDER WHETHER IN THE LATE MIDDLE AGES THE INVENTORS THE 
EMBROIDERERS OF THE ARTHURIAN STORY LOOKED AT THIS AND FOUND INSPIRATION 
NO SINGLE BOOK HAS BEEN IN ENGLAND LONGER THAN THE GOSPELS OF SAINT AUGUSTINE 
AND FOURTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AFTER IT CAME TO THESE SHORES 
ITS HALLOWED PAGES CONTINUE TO HAVE A PLACE IN MODERN RELIGIOUS RITUAL 
IT IS STILL USED FOR THE OATH TAKING OF EACH OF THE NEW ARCHBISHOPS OF CANTERBURY SO WHEN DOCTOR WILLIAMS 
WAS ENTHRONED AS ARCHBISHOP RECENTLY 
THE MASTER OF CORPUS CHRISTI AND I MYSELF AS FELLOW LIBRARIAN OF CORPUS CHRISTI TOOK THIS MANUSCRIPT 
DOWN TO CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL AND I CARRIED IT IN THE PROCESSION 
A GOTHIC CATHEDRAL ABSOLUTELY FILLED WITH PEOPLE SINGING VERY LOUD MAKES THE AIR VIBRATE 
AND I HAD THIS EXTRAORDINARY EFFECT THAT THE PARCHMENT IN THE BOOK BEGAN 
TO VIBRATE IN TIME WITH THE MUSIC 
HAD I BEEN OPEN TO A SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE 
I WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THE BOOK ITSELF WAS SINGING 
THE MYSTICAL CHARGE OF SUCH MANUSCRIPTS HAD AN ELECTRIFYING EFFECT ON PEOPLE 
WHO HAD NEVER SEEN THE WRITTEN WORD GIVEN SUCH MAJESTY AND MAGNIFICENCE 
THESE EXTRAVAGANT ILLUSTRATIONS WERE LIKE SPIRITUAL CLUSTER BOMBS 
AND THEIR IMPACT HELPED THE CHURCH SUCCEED 
IN ITS MISSION TO CONVERT ENGLAND TO CHRISTIANITY 
FROM THE SIXTH CENTURY ONWARDS THERE WAS A HUGE RISE IN THE NUMBER AND POWER OF MONASTERIES AND CHURCHES 
SOON THE BRITISH ISLES WERE CAUGHT IN AN EVANGELICAL PINCER MOVEMENT 
FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE SEVENTH CENTURY MISSIONARIES FROM THE CONTINENT 
WERE JOINED BY MONKS FROM IRELAND WHO CONVERTED THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN ENGLAND 
AS THEIR STRENGTH INCREASED THE MONKS PRODUCED ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS 
THAT ACTED AS INSTRUCTION MANUALS TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE WAS SINGING FROM THE SAME HYMN BOOK 
THE EXHIBITION IN CAMBRIDGE SHOWS THE FULL GAMUT OF 
THE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF RELIGIOUS BOOKS THAT THE MONKS EMBELLISHED 
THERE ARE BREVIARIES OR PRAYER BOOKS PRIMARILY FOR PRIVATE USE 
AND THESE ARE MISSALS OR GUIDEBOOKS FOR THE LATIN MASS 
IN THIS ONE A CRUCIFIXION SCENE HAS BEEN PLACED OPPOSITE THE TEXT LIKE A PAINTING HUNG ON A WALL 
A POTENT VISUAL REMINDER OF THE SOLEMNITY REQUIRED WHEN TAKING COMMUNION 
SUCH IMAGES TURNED THE WRITTEN WORD INTO A MEDIEVAL MULTIMEDIA EXPERIENCE INCREASING 
THE POWER AND INTENSITY OF THE TEXT 
AND MAKING ITS MESSAGE BOTH VISUALLY AND VISCERALLY UNFORGETTABLE 
BASICALLY I WOULD SAY THAT ILLUMINATION WAS THERE 
NOT AS EXPLANATION OR EVEN ILLUSTRATION 
BUT AS DECORATION AS GLORIFICATION 
AND AS A WAY OF GIVING ADDED VALUE TO THE WORD OF GOD 
THEY DID NOT HAVE A SOLELY RELIGIOUS PURPOSE 
THEY WERE MEANT TO BE REPOSITORIES OF VALUE BUT DOES GOD LIKE GOLD REALLY DO WE KNOW 
STRICTLY SPEAKING FOR A MANUSCRIPT TO BE DESCRIBED AS ILLUMINATED 
IT SHOULD HAVE DECORATION OF GOLD OR SILVER ALTHOUGH THE TERM 
IS NOW WIDELY USED TO DESCRIBE ANY BRIGHTLY ILLUSTRATED TEXT 
ONE OF THE MOST UNASHAMEDLY OPULENT OF SUCH MANUSCRIPTS WAS THE PONTIFICAL 
A MANUAL FOR BISHOPS GIVING GUIDANCE ON SPECIAL SERVICES SUCH AS THE CONSECRATION OF CATHEDRALS 
THIS ONE WAS CREATED FOR THE BISHOP OF METZ 
I LOVE THE SPECTACULAR ABSTRACT BACKGROUNDS 
ESPECIALLY THIS DAZZLING DIAMOND LATTICE OF GOLD AND BLUE 
IT IMBUES YOU WITH A SENSE OF THE SACRED 
IN THE BOOK'S PAGES THE WORLD SEEMS TO SHIMMER WITH SPIRITUAL ENERGY 
THE ARTIST'S WAY OF EXPRESSING THE INEFFABLE MYSTERIES OF THE DIVINE 
AS PART OF HER RESEARCH FOR THE EXHIBITION 
PENNY PRICE SPENT MONTHS REPRODUCING A SINGLE LEAF FROM THE METZ PONTIFICAL 
SHE USED EXACTLY THE SAME MATERIALS AS THE ORIGINAL ARTIST 
WHEN IT COMES TO CREATING SOMETHING LIKE THIS A PAINTING ON A PAGE 
HOW MANY STAGES OF PROCESS ARE INVOLVED THERE 
THIS LITTLE ARRAY OF THINGS THAT YOU'VE GOT OUT HERE 
SUGGESTS THAT BEFORE YOU PAINT YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR PAINT 
YEAH YOU ARE THEN GOING TO WHAT 
A PESTLE AND MORTAR 
OR ON A SLAB 
AND THE RESULT IS THIS WHICH IS THE POWDERED LAPIS WHICH I'M NOT GOING 
TO TIP OUT BECAUSE IT'S TOO PRECIOUS 
IN THE PAST IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A BOOK OF GOLD 
BUT IF WE COME TO THE CENTREPIECE THE STAR ATTRACTION 
PRESUMABLY IT'S NOT JUST DRAWN OUT IN FREE HAND 
PRESUMABLY THERE'S SOME KIND OF DESIGN AND TRANSFER PROCESS YES 
I HAVE HERE A PIECE OF SLUNK VELLUM WHICH IS CALFSKIN SO IT'S FROM AN UNBORN CALF 
AND IT'S VERY THIN YOU CAN PROBABLY SEE MY FINGERS THROUGH IT 
SOMETHING SLIGHTLY GHOULISH ABOUT THAT ISN'T THERE 
IT'S PRODUCED FROM A FOETUS YES 
I WOULD PLACE MY UTERINE VELLUM OR THIN PAPER ONTO THE IMAGE 
AND TRACE IT DOWN FIRST OF ALL WITH A STYLUS 
SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE A FORM OF PRINT TRANSFER PROCESSING ISN'T IT 
IT IS NOT FAR AWAY 
IT'S REALLY VERY GOOD ISN'T IT 
I WONDER WHAT THE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS OF IT WERE A BIT OF LEAD POISONING 
A BIT OF LEAD POISONING YES PRESUMABLY SOME VERY VERY SORE EYES 
VERY SORE EYES SOMETIMES YOU GET A LITTLE COLOPHON AT THE END OF A PIECE OF WORK SAYING 
THANK GOD I'VE FINISHED THIS PIECE OF WORK 
REALLY IT'S FULL OF LOVELY LITTLE HUMAN TOUCHES 
I ALWAYS WONDER 
WHAT DID THEY DO IF THEY MADE A MISTAKE 
AFTER ALL THAT WHAT WOULD THEY DO 
IF THEY MADE A MISTAKE THERE WERE SEVERAL OPTIONS 
THE MORE INVENTIVE SCRIBE WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE A LADDER OR A FISHING LINE AND HE'D BE HAULING UP 
THE CORRECT WORD OR THE WORD THAT WAS MISSING 
THAT'S GREAT I LOVE THE IDEA OF 
HAVING THE RIGHT LETTER SORT OF HOVERING ON A CRANE 
AS IF TO BE WINCHED INTO PLACE THAT SORT OF SENSE THAT THEY PUT THE MISTAKE ACTUALLY IN 
THEY DID THEY MAKE A VIRTUE OR A JOKE OUT OF IT YES 
AS WELL AS CORRECTING THEIR OWN MISTAKES SOME SCRIBES WERE PREPARED TO AMEND THE WORK OF OTHERS 
WHILE PRODUCING A FOUR VOLUME EDITION OF THE BIBLE FOR THOMAS BECKET THE TWELFTH CENTURY ARCHBISHOP 
HERBERT OF BOSHAM UPDATED KEY PASSAGES OF SCRIPTURE 
NOW HERBERT WAS THE MOST LEARNED 
HEBREW SCHOLAR OF THE LATE TWELFTH CENTURY 
AND WHEN HE EMBARKED ON THIS VAST PROJECT 
HE DECIDED TO CREATE MORE THAN JUST A GLOSSED BIBLE FOR HIS MASTER 
HE CREATED THE CRITICAL EDITION 
HE COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO CORRECT 
THE COMMENTARY WRITTEN BY HIS GREAT MASTER PETER LOMBARD 
CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY 
WHAT HERBERT DID WAS HE INCLUDED IMAGES IN THE MARGINS OF THE COMMENTARY 
POINTING WITH LANCES AT THE WRONG PASSAGES AND SAYING I DIDN'T SAY THAT 
THERE'S ANOTHER SUCH ERROR IN THE BURY BIBLE WHERE MOSES IS DEPICTED WITH HORNS 
THIS WAS A COMMON BLUNDER REPEATED RIGHT UP TO THE RENAISSANCE BY NO LESS A FIGURE THAN MICHELANGELO 
IT HAD ITS ORIGINS IN A SIMPLE TRANSLATION MISTAKE 
IT WAS A WRONG TRANSLATION OF THE HEBREW WORD WHICH 
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY MEANS THAT LIGHT WAS EMANATING 
IT WAS LIKE A NIMBUS LIKE A HALO AROUND MOSES'S HEAD 
BUT THE TRANSLATION OF THE HEBREW WORD WAS WRONG 
AND HE APPEARED IN THE TEXT IN LATIN AS HORNED MOSES 
OF COURSE ARTISTS PICKED UP ON THAT AND FROM THERE ON MOSES WAS ALWAYS DEPICTED WITH HORNS 
BY THIS STAGE IT WASN'T JUST MONKS AND CLERICS MAKING THE OCCASIONAL ERROR 
BECAUSE ILLUMINATION WAS BECOMING BIG BUSINESS 
THE TWELFTH CENTURY HAD SEEN THE EMERGENCE OF PROFESSIONAL SCRIBES AND ILLUMINATORS 
A NEW CLASS OF ARTISANS WHO WERE IN IT FOR THE MONEY AS WELL AS FOR THE GLORY OF GOD 
AT THE SAME TIME RICH INDIVIDUALS HAD BEGUN 
TO COMMISSION BOOKS OF THEIR OWN PAYING HANDSOMELY FOR THE PRIVILEGE 
THE MORE THEY SPENT THE FINER THE WORK AND THE MORE PRECIOUS GOLD LEAF AND LAPIS LAZULI LAVISHED UPON IT 
WORLDLINESS AND SPIRITUALITY WERE INEXTRICABLY LINKED DURING THE MIDDLE AGES 
AND NOWHERE MORE SO THAN IN THE STATUS SYMBOL CUM HOLY SONGBOOK THAT WAS 
THE ILLUMINATED PSALTER THE PAGES OF WHICH CONTAINED ALL ONE HUNDRED FIFTY OLD TESTAMENT PSALMS 
FOR CENTURIES THIS BOOK THE MACCLESFIELD PSALTER LAY FORGOTTEN IN THE LIBRARY AT SHERBORNE CASTLE 
IT NARROWLY AVOIDED BEING SOLD TO AN AMERICAN MUSEUM 
AFTER A CAMPAIGN RAISED SUFFICIENT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DONATIONS 
TO FIND A NEW HOME FOR IT HERE AT THE FITZWILLIAM IN CAMBRIDGE 
OFTEN THE EXPERIENCE OF LOOKING AT BOOKS IN EXHIBITIONS IS DEEPLY FRUSTRATING 
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO GET INTO THE CASE AND OPEN THEM 
BUT BECAUSE THE MACCLESFIELD PSALTER WHICH IS PROBABLY THE SINGLE MOST 
ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPT TO HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN RECENT MEMORY 
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN UNBOUND FOR RESTORATION YOU CAN FOLLOW IT PAGE BY PAGE 
IT OPENS A WINDOW ON SO TO SPEAK THE UNOFFICIAL ASPECTS OF THE MEDIEVAL IMAGINATION 
YES YOU GET THE OFFICIAL ILLUSTRATION OF THE SCENES FROM THE BIBLE BUT WHAT 
YOU ALSO GET ARE ALL THESE WONDERFUL MARGINALIA WHERE THE ARTIST HAS JUST LET HIS FANTASY FLOW FREELY 
WHY MEDIEVAL BOOKS HAVE MARGINALIA WHICH ARE FUNNY AND RUDE 
AND SATIRICAL IS A BURNING QUESTION 
BECAUSE TO OUR EYES IN A SENSE WE HAVE A RATHER SOLEMN VIEW OF RELIGION AS SOMETHING SLIGHTLY SANITISED 
BUT CLEARLY IN THE MIDDLE AGES THE WHOLE QUESTION OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES APPLYING 
DIFFERENT OR LACK OF BOUNDARIES APPLYING IS VERY RELEVANT 
WHEN YOU SEE A BUNNY PLAYING AN ORGAN VERY HAPPILY AND THERE'S A DOG PUMPING THE ORGAN AT THE BACK 
AND THE DOG LOOKS REALLY FED UP WHY WAS THIS FOUND FUNNY 
THERE'S A LOT ABOUT RABBITS AND ANIMALS IN THESE BOOKS 
THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE USED ANIMALS AS METAPHORS FOR HUMAN SITUATIONS 
WHAT A DEAR LITTLE BOOK THE MACCLESFIELD PSALTER IS 
IT'S A MAD LITTLE BOOK 
THE PERSON WHO'S ILLUMINATING THAT 
SEEMS TO BE ON HIS MOBILE PHONE TO HIERONYMUS BOSCH THE WHOLE TIME 
I'VE NEVER SEEN GROTESQUES LIKE THAT 
AND YOU KNOW THAT SOME OF THEM HAVE GOT THE FACE OF THE TAX COLLECTOR ONLY IT'S ON SOMEBODY'S BOTTOM 
THAT'S JUST GREAT 
THERE'S A MAN HAVING A FIGHT WITH A SNAIL 
WELL YOU CAN LOOK FOR A MEANING AS TO WHY A MAN IS HAVING A FIGHT WITH A SNAIL 
BUT IF THE WHOLE CONTROL OF SCALE IS IN YOUR HANDS 
YOU HARDLY NEED A MEANING 
YOU CAN DO IT AND IF YOU'RE FREEWHEELING DOWN IN THE CORNER 
WHERE NO ONE IS PARTICULARLY GOING TO SEE YOU THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT I THINK 
WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHAT THE MIDDLE AGES WERE LIKE 
THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SOME WAY THAT PEOPLE COULD ENCOMPASS IMMENSE DEVOTION 
WITH AN INVERSION OF THAT DEVOTION 
SO THAT YOU COULD PARODY IT MOCK IT TURN MONKS INTO MONKEYS 
YOU COULD SHOW FORNICATION DEFECATION YOU COULD SHOW THE WHOLE GAMUT OF BODILY FUNCTIONS 
ALL ROUND THE EDGES OF WHAT WAS AN INCREDIBLE ACT OF DEVOTION AND PIETY 
BY THE LATE MIDDLE AGES PSALTERS WERE VERY POPULAR 
NO AFFLUENT HOME WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT ONE BUT THE MOST TREASURED POSSESSION IN ANY HOUSEHOLD 
WAS THE BOOK OF HOURS A COMPENDIUM OF TEXTS HONOURING THE VIRGIN MARY 
MOST WERE OWNED BY WOMEN WHO WOULD READ THEM IN PRIVATE AT SET TIMES DURING THE DAY 
THEY TENDED TO BE SMALL 
BUT THEY WERE THE MOST RICHLY JEWELLED AND COLOURFUL BOOKS 
A FAMILY COULD POSSESS 
FOR MOST PEOPLE IT WAS THE ONLY BOOK THEY EVER OWNED 
FOR MANY OF OUR ANCESTORS THE ONLY BOOK THEY'D EVER SEEN 
IT WAS THE BOOK FROM WHICH CHILDREN WOULD LEARN TO READ IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
YOU SOMETIMES GET THE ALPHABET WRITTEN OUT IN A BOOK OF HOURS AND A CHILD WOULD LEARN FROM IT 
IT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST WIDELY CIRCULATED BOOK 
IN THE MIDDLE AGES AND OFTEN THE MOST RICHLY ILLUSTRATED 
SO WE SEE A BOOK OF HOURS FUNCTIONING AS THE PRIVATE GALLERY THE PRIVATE PRAYER BOOK 
THE SYMBOL OF THE ARTISTIC PATRONAGE 
AND A REALLY POWERFUL STATEMENT OF THE WEALTH AND TASTE OF AN INDIVIDUAL 
POSSESSION OF THESE BOOKS SIGNALLED THE PRESTIGE OF THE OWNER BUT THEY ALSO OFFERED SOMETHING ELSE 
IN AN AGE BEFORE THE TECHNOLOGIES OF DISTRACTION TELEVISION 
OR THE INTERNET THESE BOOKS WERE A GATEWAY INTO ANOTHER WORLD 
FOR THOSE WHO COULD AFFORD THEM THEY WERE A MEANS OF ESCAPE 
I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU COULD COMPARE 
YOUR PRIVATE BOOK OF DEVOTIONS AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SOMETHING LIKE A CUSTOM BUILT IPOD 
WITH YOUR INITIALS EMBOSSED IN GOLD OR SOMETHING BUT EVEN THEN YOU'RE NOWHERE NEAR THE VALUE OF THE THING 
PERHAPS OWNING A MANUSCRIPT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIKE OWNING A MOTOR CAR NOW 
A WEALTHY PERSON WOULD BUY A NEW ONE MOST OF US WOULD BUY A SECOND HAND ONE 
A BOOK MADE IN A MONASTERY WOULD PROBABLY BE THE EQUIVALENT TO COMMISSIONING A NEW BUILDING NOW 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ENORMOUS UNDERTAKING 
UNTIL THE END OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY MOST ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS WERE RELIGIOUS TEXTS 
DECORATIVE LITERATURE CREATED FOR THE GREATER GLORY OF GOD 
BUT NEW SECULAR INSTITUTIONS WERE ABOUT TO EMERGE 
AND THEY WOULD CREATE THE DEMAND FOR A NEW STYLE OF BOOK 
THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY SAW THE RISE OF A NEW KIND OF INSTITUTION THE UNIVERSITY 
THE EARLIEST UNIVERSITIES WERE AT BOLOGNA PARIS OXFORD AND HERE AT CAMBRIDGE 
WHERE THE TEACHING CURRICULUM WAS DIVIDED INTO FOUR MAIN FACULTIES 
THEOLOGY MEDICINE THE LAW AND THE ARTS 
AS THE STUDENT POPULATION ROSE SO TOO DID THE NEED FOR BOOKS 
YOU GET HISTORY GEOGRAPHY SCIENCE MEDICINE ASTRONOMY ASTROLOGY TRAVEL 
BOOKS OF ANIMALS ENCYCLOPAEDIAS 
BOOKS OF LAW VERY COMMON INDEED OFTEN NOT VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT VERY IMPORTANT 
BOOKS OF MANY ASPECTS OF MEDIEVAL ADMINISTRATION SURVIVE AND THEY'RE NOT AT ALL RELIGIOUS 
THESE ACADEMIC TEXTS WERE LESS DECORATIVE AND MORE FUNCTIONAL 
THEY NEEDED TO BE PRODUCED QUICKLY AND CHEAPLY FOR THE GROWING STUDENT POPULATION 
MOST WERE LESS ELABORATE AND LESS BEAUTIFUL THAN THE BOOKS THAT PRECEDED THEM 
THIS INCREASINGLY LITERATE NATION SOUGHT TO BE ENTERTAINED AS WELL AS EDUCATED 
PEOPLE WANTED TO READ FOR PLEASURE 
ALTHOUGH THE BIBLICAL ACCOUNT OF THE APOCALYPSE MIGHT NOT BE EVERYONE'S PERFECT BEDTIME STORY 
IT BECAME HUGELY POPULAR IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
THE APOCALYPSE IS AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TEXT TO REALISE 
YOU'VE ONLY GOT TO READ IT IT'S VERY STRANGE 
HOW DO YOU FLESH IT OUT HOW DO YOU MAKE SENSE OF IT 
AND OF COURSE THE MEDIEVAL MIND RESPONDED VERY LITERALLY 
IF A BEAST WAS HELD TO HAVE SO MANY HEADS AND WINGS AND OTHER PHYSICAL FEATURES 
THEY'RE REPRESENTED BUT THE KEY THING IS WHEREAS 
THE MODERN SENSE OF THE WORD APOCALYPSE IS NEGATIVE WE THINK ABOUT AN APOCALYPTIC SCENARIO 
THE CHRISTIAN APOCALYPSE IS AN OPTIMISTIC TEXT 
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE THE POWERS OF GOOD WILL WIN OUT OVER THE POWERS OF EVIL ALL THAT KIND OF THING 
THEN AS NOW ROMANCE WAS AN ESPECIALLY POPULAR GENRE 
THOUGH IN THE MIDDLE AGES ROMANCE DIDN'T SIMPLY MEAN A LOVE STORY 
IT MEANT AN ADVENTURE AND ONE THAT COULD INVOLVE ALL KINDS OF EXTREMELY LURID AND VIOLENT EVENTS 
THE FIRST REALLY HUGE BESTSELLER IS THE GOLDEN LEGEND 
AND WE'VE GOT A COPY OF THE FRENCH TRANSLATION 
FROM THE LATIN OF THE LEGENDA AUREA IN THIS EXHIBITION 
AND IT'S REALLY FUN TO SEE IT THERE ALTHOUGH THEY CHOSE RATHER DREARY SAINTS TO ILLUSTRATE 
I WANTED SOME BREASTS BEING SAWN OFF AND SOME EYES BEING POKED OUT BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE THEM 
ILLUSTRATORS BEGAN TO EMBELLISH THE WORKS OF THE MOST FAMOUS WRITERS OF THE DAY 
THIS MOTIF IS FROM TROILUS AND CRISEYDE GEOFFREY CHAUCER'S GREAT NARRATIVE POEM 
PAINTED BY AN UNKNOWN ARTIST IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THE FRONTISPIECE CONTAINS AN IMAGINARY LANDSCAPE 
WITH A FAIRY TALE CASTLE SET AGAINST A SKY CREATED FROM PURE GOLD LEAF 
INSTEAD OF ILLUSTRATING THE VERSE THE ARTIST DEPICTS CHAUCER HIMSELF READING HIS STORY TO THE PEOPLE 
THE AREA BESIDE HIS HEAD HAS BECOME BLURRED BY GENERATIONS 
OF OILY FINGER POINTING PEOPLE TOUCHING THE PAGE TO POINT AND SAY LOOK THAT'S GEOFFREY CHAUCER 
IT'S A WONDERFUL LITTLE PIECE OF EVIDENCE OF THE AWE AND PLEASURE 
THAT THE ILLUSTRATED BOOK CAN AROUSE 
WITHIN A DECADE OF THE CREATION OF THAT VIVID PORTRAIT OF CHAUCER 
THE WHOLE CULTURE OF THE BOOK WAS REVOLUTIONISED BY A NEW INVENTION 
THE PRINTING PRESS DEVELOPED BY GUTENBERG IN GERMANY AND SOON TAKEN UP BY WILLIAM CAXTON IN ENGLAND 
PRINTING CHANGED MAN'S ENTIRE SPIRITUAL AND INTELLECTUAL LANDSCAPE 
IT WAS TECHNOLOGY OF A KIND THAT COULDN'T BE RESISTED 
BUT LIKE ALL NEW TECHNOLOGIES IT LEFT CASUALTIES IN ITS WAKE 
AND THE BEAUTIFUL HAND CRAFTED ILLUMINATED BOOK WAS DESTINED TO BE ONE OF THEM 
IT WASN'T DEAD YET BUT IT SOON WOULD BE 
THE PRINTING SO TO SPEAK WAS ON THE WALL 
IF YOU LOOK AT A REALLY BEAUTIFUL EARLY PRINTED BOOK PAINTED BY HAND 
AT FIRST SIGHT YOU COULD BARELY TELL THAT IT'S NOT A MANUSCRIPT AND THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT 
THEY HAD TO LOOK LIKE MANUSCRIPTS 
BECAUSE WE KNOW OF SOME LEADING BIBLIOPHILES IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY WHO DESPISED PRINTED BOOKS 
THE EARLY PRINTERS NEEDED PATRONAGE AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL AND THE ONLY WAY TO ENTICE BIBLIOPHILES 
TO SUPPORT THEIR NEW ENDEAVOUR WAS TO CREATE PRINTED BOOKS 
AS OPULENT AND RICH AS THE MANUSCRIPT 
AS TECHNOLOGY IMPROVED THE ADVANTAGES OF THE PRINTED BOOK 
WOULD RENDER THE ELABORATELY HAND CRAFTED TEXT OBSOLETE 
IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY THE LIGHTS BEGAN TO GO OUT 
ON THE ONE THOUSAND YEAR OLD TRADITION OF ILLUMINATION 
THE EMERGENCE OF PRINTING LEFT ILLUMINATION MORTALLY WOUNDED 
BUT IN ENGLAND IT WOULD BE HENRY THE EIGHTH WHO DELIVERED THE COUP DE GRACE 
HAVING SEVERED ALL LINKS WITH THE CHURCH OF ROME 
HE ORDERED THE DISSOLUTION OF THE MONASTERIES AND THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL ROMAN CATHOLIC LITERATURE 
COUNTLESS NUMBERS OF PRECIOUS MANUSCRIPTS WERE CONSUMED BY HENRY'S FIRE 
YET DESPITE THE TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD BEFALL ANYONE DEFYING THE KING 
SOME MANUSCRIPTS WERE SAVED FROM THE FLAMES 
I THINK PEOPLE'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS RELIGIOUS BOOKS 
IS ALWAYS COMPLICATED BECAUSE IF THEY CONTAIN THE WORD OF GOD YOU KNOW TO DESTROY THEM 
ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL AS WELL IS 
ONE WOULD THINK A RISKY ACT TO UNDERTAKE SO 
THERE IS A SENSE IN WHICH 
IT COULD BE PRUDENT TO KIND OF HEDGE YOUR BETS BY SAVING BOOKS AND PRESERVING THEM 
THE DISSOLUTION OF THE MONASTERIES IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY SAW THE END OF 
A GREAT MANY LIBRARIES AND IRONICALLY CAMBRIDGE WAS THE BENEFICIARY OF THIS DISSOLUTION 
THE LIBRARIES OF CORPUS CHRISTI COLLEGE AND TRINITY COLLEGE 
WERE CREATED TO A LARGE EXTENT FROM THE SPOILS OF THESE MONASTIC LIBRARIES 
IN THE SAFE RESTING PLACE OF THE ACADEMIES MANY OF THESE MANUSCRIPTS HAVE SURVIVED ENTIRELY INTACT 
THEY'RE AS COMPLETE AS COLOURFUL AND VIBRANT AS THEY WERE WHEN THEY WERE CREATED 
MUCH MORE SO THAN MANY OF THE PAINTINGS AND SCULPTURES OF THE TIME 
TO ME THEY REALLY ARE AMONG ENGLAND'S GREATEST TREASURES 
I HAVE SEEN AND HANDLED PROBABLY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS 
I CAN NEVER PICK ONE UP WITHOUT AN EXTRAORDINARY THRILL 
YOU ARE HOLDING IN YOUR HANDS ACTUALLY THERE A REAL OBJECT THAT HAS SURVIVED FOR FIVE HUNDRED OR ONE THOUSAND YEARS 
AND IT'S RATHER LIKE THE THRILL OF MEETING A VERY FAMOUS PERSON 
YOU PRETEND IT'S OF NO SIGNIFICANCE BUT THERE IS 
THE BOOK SEEMS INCREASINGLY UNDER THREAT BECAUSE WE SEEM TO BE 
ON THE CUSP OF A WHOLE NEW TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION 
I CAN EVEN IMAGINE THE DAY WHEN WE WON'T READ BOOKS ANYMORE 
WE'LL ONLY DOWNLOAD FILES AND LOOK AT THEM ON SCREENS 
AND I THINK THE MAIN REASON WHY I FIND THE EXHIBITION IN CAMBRIDGE SO TOUCHING 
IS BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE US BACK VERY VIVIDLY TO A TIME WHEN THE ACTS OF READING 
AND WRITING WERE CHARGED WITH A SOLEMNITY AND SERIOUSNESS OF PURPOSE THAT SEEM ALMOST UNIMAGINABLE TODAY 
WHATEVER THE FUTURE HOLDS IN STORE FOR THE BOOK I THINK ONE THING'S FOR CERTAIN 
BOOKS THEMSELVES WILL NEVER BE AS BEAUTIFUL AS FINELY CRAFTED 
AS VISUALLY MEMORABLE AS THOSE GATHERED UNDER GLASS HERE IN CAMBRIDGE
