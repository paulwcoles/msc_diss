WELCOME TO A SUPER QUICK BLINK OR YOU'LL MISS IT EDITION OF FOOTBALL GAFFES GALORE 
FIRST UP THE TOP SEVEN CARELESS HANDS 
IN WORLD WAR ONE THERE WAS A SAYING 
CARELESS TALK COSTS LIVES 
IN FOOTBALL THERE'S A SAYING TOO 
GREAT CORNER GREAT HEADER GREAT SAVE 
OH YOU DIV 
OH IT'S A MISTAKE BY THE GOALKEEPER 
AND RUDI VOELLER FOLLOWED IN 
CAN'T BLAME THE KEEPER HERE 
VOELLER'S MULLET IS BEARING DOWN ON HIM LIKE A HEAD MOUNTED FERRET 
THAT'S ENOUGH TO PUT ANYONE OFF 
THE SOCCEROOS KEEPER WAS KNOWN AS SPIDER 
IN THE DRESSING ROOM HE COULDN'T GET OUT OF THE BATH 
AN AWFUL ERROR FROM THE AUSTRALIAN GOALKEEPER 
AND HE ATE FLIES AND REGURGITATED HIS FOOD 
I MADE THAT UP TO BE HONEST I HAD TO THE TRUTH IS PRETTY BORING 
HE'S GOT EIGHT LEGS 
OH AND DROPPED COMPLETELY BY BROWN 
LATER ON BROWN LET IN TEN GOALS IN ONE GAME AGAINST GILLINGHAM 
HERE HE IS GETTING A BIT OF PRACTICE IN 
SCOTLAND ROMPED HOME TWO TO ZERO AGAINST THIS ULTRA MOBILE ZAIRE TEAM 
AND THROUGH THE GOALKEEPER TWO TO ZERO 
LET'S SEE THAT AGAIN 
I'VE SEEN SUBBUTEO PLAYERS REACT QUICKER THAN THAT 
DALGLISH TWISTS TURNS 
THE SHOT IS NOTHING SPECIAL BUT WATCH THE GUY BEHIND THE GOAL 
ONE CAN ONLY FEEL DESPAIR FOR RAY CLEMENCE 
HIS JOB IS TO MEASURE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN RAY CLEMENCE'S LEGS 
THERE IT IS 
SIX FEET TWO INCHES A NEW WORLD RECORD 
GARY SPRAKE FORGETS THE LAWS OF GRAVITY 
WHAT GOES UP MUST COME DOWN 
AND A GOAL 
AND SPRAKE FURIOUS WITH HIMSELF 
AS INDEED HE OUGHT TO BE 
THINK OF YOUR OWN CAREER IF IT HELPS GARY 
NEXT IT'S THE TOP FOUR CUP FINAL CATASTROPHES 
IN AT FOUR CALAMITY JAMES IS BACK 
OH AND JAMES HASN'T QUITE GOT THAT AND IT'S IN 
THIS WAS THE LAST F. A. CUP FINAL PLAYED AT WEMBLEY 
THIS MISTAKE WAS SO BAD THEY DECIDED TO KNOCK THE WHOLE STADIUM DOWN IMMEDIATELY 
AT THREE IT'S JAMIE CARRAGHER A CLASSIC CENTRE FORWARD GOAL 
AND IT'S GOING TO BE AN OWN GOAL 
IT'S AN OWN GOAL 
HANG ON IT'S THE WRONG END DOES THAT COUNT 
AND ALL THE PRESSURE NOW ON ROBERTO BAGGIO WHO HAS TO SCORE 
BAGGIO WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN GETTING ITALY TO THIS WORLD CUP FINAL 
IT'S OVER THE TOP 
ITALIAN MANAGER SACCHI NEVER PICKED HIM FOR ITALY AGAIN 
BUT HE LATER WENT ON TO BE ENGLAND'S PENALTY COACH 
HANG ON ISN'T THAT GARY SPRAKE AGAIN 
AND HE SCORES 
YEAH THAT'S VINTAGE SPRAKE ALL RIGHT 
RUBBISH SEE YOU 
TONIGHT HUGH GRANT STARS IN OUR REASONABLY PRICED CAR 
AND IS THE NEW AUDI T. T. ANY GOOD 
WE FIND OUT BY PLAYING GOLF 
HELLO AND WELCOME THANK YOU FOR THAT 
THANK YOU 
NOW 
AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW 
AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW JAMES MAY IS THE SLOWEST MAN IN THE ENTIRE WORLD 
BY THE TIME HE SETS OFF ANYWHERE NORMALLY HIS HAIR HAS GROWN ANOTHER INCH 
SO PLAINLY HE WAS THE IDEAL MAN 
TO TRY AND MAX THE FASTEST CAR IN THE WORLD 
LAST YEAR THE MIGHTY BUGATTI VEYRON STARRED IN OUR GREATEST TOP GEAR CHALLENGE EVER 
WHEN IT RACED AN AEROPLANE ACROSS THE CONTINENT 
IN THAT FILM JEREMY TALKED ENDLESSLY 
ABOUT THE VEYRON'S FEROCIOUS POWER AND ITS INCREDIBLE TOP SPEED 
BUT BECAUSE HE WAS ON PUBLIC ROADS HE HAD TO STICK TO THE SPEED LIMIT 
BUT TODAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT WE'RE GOING TO DO IT 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE FASTEST PRODUCTION CAR IN THE WORLD UP TO ITS TOP SPEED 
THAT TOP SPEED IS TWO FIFTY THREE M. P. H. 
MUCH FASTER THAN A FORMULA ONE CAR 
AND WHEN YOU THINK THAT IT HAS AIRBAGS AIR CONDITIONING A STEREO 
A BOOT AND ALL THE OTHER STUFF F. ONE CARS AREN'T BURDENED WITH 
YOU REALISE WHAT AN INCREDIBLE MACHINE THIS IS 
THE VEYRON IS ABOUT PUSHING THE OUTSIDE OF THE ENVELOPE 
IT'S ABOUT DOING THINGS THAT PEOPLE SAID JUST WERE NOT POSSIBLE 
THIS CAR IS A SORT OF CONCORDE MOMENT 
GETTING THE CAR TO DO ONE FIFTY FIVE M. P. H. FRANKLY ISN'T REALLY VERY DIFFICULT 
THE VEYRON NEEDS JUST A PIFFLING TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY HORSEPOWER TO REACH THAT SPEED 
BUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THREE CRIKEY 
THE FASTER YOU GO THE MORE MOTHER NATURE TRIES TO HOLD YOU BACK 
SO TO DO THE NEXT ONE HUNDRED M. P. H. 
THE ONE HUNDRED M. P. H. THAT TAKES YOU UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
NEEDS ANOTHER SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY HORSEPOWER 
SO WHAT YOU END UP WITH IS A SIXTEEN CYLINDER ENGINE 
WITH FOUR TURBO CHARGERS 
PRODUCING ONE THOUSAND ONE HORSEPOWER 
AND A LOT OF HEAT 
THAT'S WHY YOUR CAR HAS ONE RADIATOR 
AND THIS CAR HAS TEN 
THE ENGINEERS REALLY WERE IN UNCHARTED TERRITORY WITH THIS CAR 
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE WHEN THEY WANTED TO SORT OUT THE HIGH SPEED AERODYNAMICS 
THEY WENT TO THE SAUBER F. ONE TEAM TO ASK TO USE THEIR WIND TUNNEL 
AND THEY SAID SORRY BUT WE DON'T GO UP TO THOSE SPEEDS 
IN FACT CRACKING TWO FIFTY THREE M. P. H. CAUSED NIGHTMARE AFTER NIGHTMARE 
BUT BUGATTI INSIST THAT THIS EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CAR CAN DO IT 
MIND YOU ACTUALLY TESTING THEIR BOLD CLAIM IS A BIT OF A PALAVER 
THIS IS EHRA LESSIEN VOLKSWAGEN'S MAXIMUM SECURITY TEST TRACK IN GERMANY 
WHEN IT WAS BUILT DURING THE COLD WAR IT WAS DELIBERATELY SITED IN A NO FLY ZONE 
NEAR THE EAST GERMAN BORDER 
IN ORDER TO STOP PRYING EYES FROM SEEING SECRET PROTOTYPES 
IT HAS OVER SIXTY MILES OF PRIVATE TRACK BUT THE BIT WE'RE INTERESTED IN 
IS THE MAIN STRAIGHT WHICH IS A WHOPPING FIVE MILES LONG 
ALTHOUGH IT IS TECHNICALLY A FLAT AND LEVEL ROAD 
IF YOU STAND HERE YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY SEE THE OTHER END 
AND THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S FOLLOWING THE CURVATURE OF THE EARTH 
BUT EVEN WHEN YOU'VE SORTED THE VENUE YOU CAN'T JUST JUMP IN THE CAR AND GO 
THIS IS GERMANY THERE ARE PROCEDURES TO GO THROUGH 
I LIKE PROCEDURES 
YOU HAVE TO INSERT A SPECIAL KEY INTO A SLOT BY THE DOOR 
AND WHEN YOU DO THE DIFFUSER FLAPS CLOSE THE REAR SPOILER RETRACTS 
AND THE WHOLE CAR HUNKERS DOWN TO BECOME AS SLIPPERY AS POSSIBLE 
THE TELEMETRY BOX WE'RE USING TO RECORD THE SPEED 
MEASURES IN KILOMETRES AN HOUR SO THE MAGIC NUMBER WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS FOUR HUNDRED SEVEN 
RIGHT HERE WE GO I'M APPROACHING THE BANKING AT THE TOP OF THE CIRCUIT 
I HAVE TO DO THIS AT TWO HUNDRED KILOMETRES AN HOUR THAT'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
AROUND THE BANKING AND LOOK FOR MY ACCELERATION POINT AND GIVE IT THE BEANS DOWN THE STRAIT 
TWO HUNDRED K. M. SLASH H. THAT'S ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
WE HAVE TO GET THE CAR SETTLED FOURTH GEAR FIVE THOUSAND REVS 
I'M LOOKING FOR THE EXIT WHERE I BURY IT 
HERE WE GO 
THE CLIMB FROM TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED KILOMETRES AN HOUR WAS OVER IN JUST NINETY FOUR SECONDS' 
THE WORLD VIEWERS IS A TOTAL BLUR 
WE ARE ALREADY DOING THREE HUNDRED THIRTY KILOMETRES I CAN'T DO THE MATHS 
GETTING UP TO AROUND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY 
CAPTAIN SLOW IS DOING THREE HUNDRED SIXTY K. I. L. O. M. E. T. R. E. S. THREE SEVENTY 
THAT'S TWO THIRTY M. P. H. 
I WAS NOW LEAVING F. ONE CARS BEHIND 
IT'S NO WONDER MICHAEL SCHUMACHER RETIRED HE'S SLOWER THAN ME 
AT THESE SORT OF SPEEDS 
THIS ENGINE IS SUCKING IN AS MUCH AIR IN A MINUTE AS I BREATHE IN FOUR DAYS 
GETTING CLOSE TO THE MAXIMUM WHICH MEANS THE TYRES WILL ONLY LAST FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES 
BUT IT'S O. K. BECAUSE THE FUEL RUNS OUT IN TWELVE MINUTES 
THIS IS A ROAD CAR AND I'M GETTING UP TO FOUR HUNDRED FOUR 
FOUR HUNDRED FIVE COME ON 
COME ON GIVE ME ONE MORE 
FOUR HUNDRED SIX I NEED ONE MORE ONE MORE 
I'M COVERING A FOOTBALL PITCH EVERY SECOND 
I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT'S AS FAST AS I'M EVER GOING TO GO IN A CAR 
INCREDIBLE 
THAT IS 
IT'S MADE MY EYES WATER 
I'M IMPRESSED JAMES 
THE THING IS THOUGH WHEN YOU TAKE A FERRARI OR PARTICULARLY A KOENIGSEGG TO ITS TOP SPEED 
NO NO ACTUALLY YOU WOULDN'T 
BUT WHEN YOU DO THEY FIZZ AND THEY BUZZ AND IT FEELS LIKE THE BODY PANELS ARE PEELING AWAY 
COS YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF WHAT'S PHYSICALLY AND TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE 
I DIDN'T GET ANY OF THAT THE ONLY THING I GOT WAS AT THE END OF THE STRAIGHT 
I HAD TO TOUCH THE BRAKE SO YOU COULD SEE THE SPOILER COME UP AND YOU GOT A SORT OF 
AND THAT'S IT YEAH SO IT'S SAFE AND RELAXING EVEN AT TWO FIFTY M. P. H. 
ABSOLUTELY YEAH 
IT'S TOTALLY UNDRAMATIC BUT I WOULD GIVE YOU A WARNING IT'S A BIT DISORIENTATING 
WHEN I COME OFF THE BANKING I WAS SLOWING DOWN TO STOP AND I WAS GOING TO OPEN THE DOOR 
FORTUNATELY I LOOKED AT THE SPEEDO AND I WAS STILL DOING SEVENTY 
U. N. O. K. S. O. 
WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT THIS IS FASTER ACROSS EUROPE THAN YOUR LIGHT AIRCRAFT YEP 
WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT IT REALLY WILL DO TWO FIFTY M. P. H. 
BUT WE'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW FAST IT WILL GO AROUND OUR TRACK 
THE PROBLEM IS BUGATTI ARE HAPPY FOR US TO HAVE ONE HERE AND FOR YOU DO TO THAT 
BUT THEY WON'T LEND THE STIG ONE 
SO THIS IS AN APPEAL IF YOU'VE GOT A VEYRON AND YOU'D LIKE TO LEND IT TO US 
WE ARE PREPARED TO PAY ANYTHING UP TO THIRTY 
NOW THE NEWS WE START OFF WITH THE PORSCHE CAYENNE 
THEY'VE COME UP WITH A NEW ONE WITH NEW BITS AND PIECES AND ENGINES 
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT IT HAS NEVER BEEN THE BEST LOOKING CAR 
NOT EVEN SLIGHTLY WE CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THIS NEW ONE STILL ISN'T THE BEST LOOKING CAR 
BECAUSE HERE'S THE OFFICIAL PHOTOGRAPH THAT PORSCHE SENT FOR US TO LOOK AT 
I CAN HEAR THE DISCUSSION THAT THE PHOTOGRAPHER HAD WITH THE DIRECTOR 
IS THE LIGHT GOOD FOR YOU NO THERE STILL IS SOME EXACTLY 
YOU KNOW THAT YOUNG RUSSIAN BUSINESS KID WHO BOUGHT TVR A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO 
WE HAVE A PICTURE OF HIM HERE AT A BUSINESS MEETING 
DIDN'T HE CLOSE DOWN A FACTORY IN BLACKPOOL AND MAKE EVERYONE REDUNDANT EXACTLY 
IT TURNS OUT THAT ALL THE TVR OWNERS ARE GONNA THROW A PARTY FOR THE WORKERS WHO'VE BEEN MADE REDUNDANT 
THE PARTY WILL INCLUDE A BUFFET DINNER 
HOW MUCH DO I NOT WANT TO GO TO THAT 
BAR DISCO AND LIVE BAND 
WOW A TVR BAND SO THEY'LL PLAY PRESUMABLY REALLY LOUD REALLY FAST 
AND THEN BURST INTO FLAMES 
FIREWORKS 
HERE'S SOME NEWS YOU KNOW THE HOT RENAULT CLIO 
THEY'VE DONE A HOTTER ONE IT'S CALLED THE R. TWENTY SEVEN IT'S GOT A LOWER STIFFER CHASSIS 
WE HAVE A PHOTOGRAPH OF IT HERE 
THESE ARE THE FOUR RENAULT FORMULA ONE RACING DRIVERS FOR THIS YEAR 
THIS CHAP THE NEW ONE HE REALLY LIKES THIS CAR HE'S VERY VERY EXCITED BY IT 
VERY VERY EXCITED 
WHOA OH 
WHOA 
HE'S REALLY PLEASED TO SEE IT ISN'T HE REALLY PLEASED 
OH OH WHAT I LOVE AS WELL IF YOU LOOK AROUND 
THE OTHER GUYS WHO CLEARLY SPOTTED THE PROBLEM 
WELL YOU COULD HARDLY MISS IT ARE ALL VERY EMBARRASSED 
O. K. I GOT THIS PHOTOGRAPH FROM A FRENCH WEBSITE 
THE OFFICIAL PHOTOGRAPH THAT WAS SENT BY RENAULT LET ME SHOW IT TO YOU 
THEY'VE SAID GO AND STAND BEHIND THE CAR YOU'RE AN EMBARASSMENT 
BUT THEY'RE ALL RACING DRIVERS COULDN'T THEY HAVE LENT HIM A CRASH HELMET TO HOLD 
IT WAS HIS CRASH HELMET THAT CAUSED THE PROBLEM LEAVE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE 
OH NOW NEWS FROM THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS 
WHO I DISCOVERED THIS WEEK IS CALLED KEN SOMETHING 
IT'S NOT KEN KEN IS THE NAME OF A MAN YOU BORROW A STEP LADDER FROM 
YEAH NOT THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS 
KEN HAS ANNOUNCED THERE'S A WHOLE RAFT OF MOTORING OFFENCES FOR WHICH YOU CAN GO TO PRISON 
ONE OF THEM IS RETUNING YOUR RADIO DON'T BE STUPID WHAT SERIOUSLY 
WHAT IF THE ARCHERS COMES ON 
I CAN'T LISTEN TO AN EPISODE OF THE ARCHERS IN THE CAR 
WITHOUT LOSING MY TEMPER AND HAVING A CRASH DELIBERATELY TO END IT 
KEN HAS DECIDED THAT WE WILL HAVE TO TOLERATE THESE THINGS 
COS YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO RETUNE THE RADIO YOU ALSO CAN'T PUT LIPSTICK ON 
AGAIN WELL 
GET THIS ONE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BE AN UNDERTAKER 
WHY NOT HANG ON ARE YOU AN UNDERTAKER 
YOU'RE AN UNDERTAKER YEAH YOU'RE GOING TO PRISON 
KEN SAYS KEN SAYS IF YOU UNDERTAKE SOMEONE 
OH HANG ON 
WELL IT IS I'VE ALWAYS HAD A BIT OF A BEEF ABOUT THIS 
BECAUSE I RECKON IF YOU GO PAST SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE THERE'S ROOM TO DO THAT 
THERE WAS ROOM FOR THEM TO GET OUT OF THE WAY IN THE FIRST PLACE 
SO IT'S THEM THEY'RE THE ONES WHO SHOULD BE PROSECUTED 
THEY CAN'T FIND PRISONS TO PUT PAEDOPHILES IN 
BUT THEY'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING HIM IN FOR BEING AN UNDERTAKER 
IT'S RIDICULOUS THEY CAN'T FIND THE PAEDOPHILES 
COS THREE HUNDRED HAVE GONE MISSING I KNOW WHERE THEY ARE 
IF YOU DRIVE DOWN THE OUTSIDE LANE OF A MOTORWAY 
NOT RETUNING THE RADIO AT FIFTY MILES AN HOUR YOU ARE IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION 
SO IT'S THE IDEAL PLACE TO GO IF YOU'RE BEING LOOKED FOR BY THE LAW 
SO THEREFORE ANYONE DOING FIFTY IN THE OUTSIDE LANE OF A MOTORWAY IS A CHILD MOLESTER 
WOW THAT'S AMAZING 
YOU'VE USED LOGIC THERE THAT'S INCREDIBLE 
ARGUE WITH THAT HEY NOW CAN I JUST SAY 
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE WE SAT HERE AS A GROUP 
AS YOU KNOW SO I THOUGHT IT'D BE A GOOD IDEA TO SEE 
THE GOOD AND BAD CARS WE'VE DRIVEN WHILE WE'VE BEEN OFF AIR 
AND I HAVE TO SAY GOOD CARS FOR ME LEXUS 
PARTICULARLY THE G. S. THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE 
I'M WITH YOU THE HYBRID ONE THOUGH 
THIS LOOKS LIKE A NORMAL CAR THE GREAT THING IS 
ITS BATTERIES WILL ONLY TAKE YOU LESS THAN A MILE 
WHICH MEANS MOST OF THE TIME YOU'RE ON THE V. SIX 
YOU'RE CHEWING FUEL WARMING THE WORLD UP EVERYBODY'S HAPPY 
IT'S VERY QUIET VERY FAST VERY VERY COMFORTABLE 
AND YOU CAN DRIVE IT TO LONDON DO U. TURNS ON PICCADILLY 
KEN LIVINGSTONE CAN'T CHARGE YOU A PENNY 
A PROPERLY BRILLIANT CAR THAT 
I'M GONNA PUT A NINE V. BATTERY IN A HUMMER 
IT'S A HYBRID 
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED IF I MAY BE BY THE SUZUKI SWIFT SPORT OH YEAH 
THIS IS THE MOST UNDERRATED 
IT'S NOT GOING OVER WELL MATE WAIT 
BEFORE YOU ALL CHIME IN IT'S A SMALL CAR 
BUT YOU KNOW I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THE NEW MINI 
IT'S TOO BIG AND LUMPEN THAT I THINK IS THE NEW MINI 
TRY IT YOU'LL BE AMAZED IT'S BRILLIANT 
THAT IS AN ORDER FROM HIM I QUITE LIKE IT 
I ACTUALLY REALLY DID LIKE THE VOLVO C. THIRTY DON'T THINK I'VE GONE MAD 
BUT IT'S A GOOD LOOKING CAR AND YOU CAN GET IT WITH THAT FIVE CYLINDER ENGINE 
THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME ONE AS IN THE FOCUS ST 
WORSE CARS ONE OF THE TOP FIVE VOLKSWAGEN GOLF G. T. THERE 
IT HAS A SUPERCHARGED TURBO ENGINE WHICH IS AS SMOOTH AS FALLING DOWN STAIRS WEARING LEG CALLIPERS 
BASICALLY 
JUST WORK HARDER AND BUY THE GOLF G. T. I. 
THERE'S A TOP GEAR TOP TIP GOOD ADVICE 
I WAS DISAPPOINTED I HATE TO HAVE TO SAY THIS 
BY THE BENTLEY ARNAGE T. NOT THE R. 
THIS IS USEFUL ADVICE FOR PEOPLE IN THE NORTH 
WELL ACTUALLY IT IS THE T. HAS A BIT MORE POWER AND A BIT MORE TORQUE AND IT'S JUST ENOUGH TO SPOIL IT 
IF YOU STICK WITH THE R. WHICH IS BEAUTIFUL IT COSTS TWELVE THOUSAND LESS SO YOU CAN BUY A HOUSE 
FOR ME IT WAS THE SUBARU TRIBECA 
IT'S AN M. P. V. AND TECHNICALLY IT'S NOT BAD BUT IT'S HIDEOUS 
AND IT'S A FAMILY CAR SO MY KIDS WERE TOO TERRIFIED TO GET IN IT 
HATED IT IT'S JUST IT IS HIDEOUS HEY NOW 
JAGUAR HAVE MADE A CONCEPT CAR NOT ANOTHER ONE 
THAT'S WHY THEY NEVER MAKE MONEY THEY KEEP MAKING CONCEPT CARS INSTEAD OF CARS YOU CAN BUY I KNOW 
THEY HAVEN'T UNDERSTOOD THAT IF YOU SELL A CAR YOU GET MONEY 
ANYWAY THIS ONE O. K. THEY SAY WE'VE GOT A PICTURE OF IT 
THEY SAY THAT IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT S. TYPE 
IT'LL LOOK THE SAME AS THAT IF THAT'S TRUE THAT'S FANTASTIC IT LOOKS BRILLIANT I KNOW 
I WENT TO SEE IT THE OTHER DAY THE DESIGNER WAS THERE AND HE SAID THE S. TYPE WILL LOOK LIKE THAT 
IF THAT CAR COMES OUT LIKE THAT I WILL CUT MY LEFT LEG OFF BEAT MYSELF TO DEATH WITH IT 
REALLY YEAH 
DO IT 
MAKE IT JUST MAKE IT NOW 
IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO SPEND BETWEEN TWENTY THOUSAND AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ON A COUPE 
YOUR CHOICE JUST BECAME A LOT MORE COMPLICATED 
SO TO SEE IF WE COULD HELP YOU OUT THE THREE OF US HAVE BEEN TO SCOTLAND FOR A ROW 
THESE ARE THE CARS THAT HAVE CAUSED THE PROBLEM 
THERE'S THE NEW AUDI T. T. 
THE NEW ALFA ROMEO BRERA 
AND THE NOT SO NEW BUT STILL QUITE INTERESTING MAZDA R. X. EIGHT 
SO LET'S START WITH THE AUDI 
I WANT TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY PLAIN THAT I DID NOT LIKE THE OLD T. T. 
BECAUSE ALL THEY DID TO MAKE IT WAS PUT A GOLF IN A PRETTY FROCK 
THAT'S LIKE PUTTING A COW IN A TRACK SUIT 
STILL NOT GOING TO WIN ANY RUNNING RACES 
WITH THIS NEW ONE THOUGH THEY REALLY HAVE GONE TO TOWN 
IT'S LONGER WIDER AND MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN THE OLD MODEL 
AND EVEN THOUGH THIS IS THE BABY OF THE RANGE IT'S MORE TECHNICAL AS WELL 
TAKE THE BODY FOR EXAMPLE 
FROM HERE BACK IT'S STEEL FROM HERE FORWARDS IT'S ALUMINIUM 
THAT NOT ONLY MAKES IT LIGHTER NINE STONE LESS THAN THE OLD T. T. IT IMPROVES WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION 
THEN THERE'S THE SUSPENSION THE FLUID IN THE SHOCK ABSORBERS HAS IRON FILINGS IN IT 
AROUND THE OUTSIDE THERE'S A MAGNET 
TURN THE MAGNET ON THE IRON FILINGS MOVE ABOUT EVERYTHING BECOMES FIRMER 
HOW MUCH DO YOU NOT WANT TO GO ON HOLIDAY WITH THE MAN WHO THOUGHT OF THAT 
THE UPSHOT IS 
THIS IS NO LONGER A COW IN A TRACK SUIT 
IT'S A COW GTI IN RACING OVERALLS 
THE STEERING IN THE OLD CAR WAS NUMB IN THIS IT FEELS CONNECTED 
THE RIDE IN THE OLD CAR WAS AS COMFORTABLE AS FALLING DOWN STAIRS 
IN THIS IT'S SMOOTH WHEN THE IRON FILINGS ARE DORMANT AND WHEN YOU PUSH THE SWITCH 
TO TURN THE MAGNETS ON 
IT BECOMES RACING CAR SHARP 
THIS IS NOT A CAR FOR TAKING YOUR HAIR TO THE HAIRDRESSERS ANY MORE 
THIS IS A CAR FOR MAKING YOUR HAIR STAND ON END IT'S A PROPER SPORTS CAR 
RUBBISH 
WHAT YOU WANT IS ONE OF THESE 
THIS IS THE NEW ALFA ROMEO BRERA 
IT IS A PRETTY CAR 
ON THE FACE OF IT THE ALFA IS EXACTLY LIKE THE T. T. 
THEY ARE BOTH FOUR SEAT COUPES 
THEY BOTH HAVE FOUR CYLINDER ENGINES THEY BOTH HAVE SIX SPEED GEAR BOXES 
THEY BOTH COST AROUND TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND 
AND THEY WILL BOTH ALSO BE AVAILABLE WITH THIRTY TWO LITRE V. SIX ENGINES AND FOUR WHEEL DRIVE 
BUT ACTUALLY THIS IS NOT LIKE A T. T. AT ALL 
WE'VE SAID THIS TIME AND AGAIN ON TOP GEAR 
YOU CANNOT CONSIDER YOURSELF A TRUE PETROL HEAD UNTIL YOU'VE OWNED AN ALFA ROMEO 
THEY ARE NOT CARS FOR POSERS THEY ARE FOR CONNOISSEURS 
SOMETIMES THEY WILL INFURIATE YOU 
OTHER TIMES THEY WILL THRILL AND EXCITE YOU 
THEY ARE NEVER EVER BORING 
IT WAS NOT DESIGNED LIKE THE AUDI USING JUST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
AND IRON FILINGS IT ALSO HAS SOUL AND PASSION THIS CAR HAS A HEART 
YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY SWINGS IT FOR ME 
IT'S THE INTERIOR 
SITTING IN HERE FEELS LIKE YOU'RE SITTING IN A MILANESE ESPRESSO BAR 
SITTING IN THE AUDI FEELS LIKE YOU'RE TRAPPED IN A BERLIN POST OFFICE 
O. K. THEN JAMES HAVE YOU TOLD THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN HOW FAST THE BRERA GOES FROM ZERO TO SIXTY 
NO I HAVEN'T I WAS RATHER HOPING YOU WOULDN'T BRING IT UP 
IT DOES IT IN EIGHTY ONE SECONDS 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED PRETTY BRISK 
YOU COULD BE OUT DRAGGED BY A CANAL BOAT 
IT'S NOT A SLOW CAR IT'S JUST NOT QUITE AS QUICK AS YOUR CAR 
WHICH IS FOR PEOPLE USING MOISTURISING PRODUCTS 
I PREFER AN ALFA TO AN AUDI BUT NOT THAT ALFA ROMEO 
THAT'S TOO SLOW AND THAT'S AN END OF IT 
IT'S PLENTY FAST ENOUGH OUR COLLEAGUE HAS ARRIVED 
HERE HE IS LORD WOOLWORTHS IS HERE 
IF IT'S POWER YOU WANT THEN THIS IS YOUR ANSWER 
THE WANKEL ENGINED MAZDA R. X. EIGHT 
WHEN IT COMES TO SPEED 
IT'LL DO ZERO TO SIXTY IN SIXTY FOUR SECONDS 
THAT'S FASTER THAN THE AUDI AND A LOT FASTER THAN THE ALFA 
TOP SPEED NIGH ON ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
PUT IT ON A TRACK AND YOU QUICKLY REALISE WHAT THIS CAR'S ALL ABOUT 
ABOUT THIS ENGINE 
IT IS DIFFERENT IT'S A ROTARY SO YOU USE IT DIFFERENTLY 
ALL THE POWER IS AT THE TOP END 
SO YOU CAN THRASH IT MERCILESSLY AND IT'LL THANK YOU FOR IT 
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE TOO 
THE ALFA IS A SALOON UNDERNEATH 
AND THE AUDI IS A GOLF IN A FROCK 
THE R. X. EIGHT HOWEVER IS BESPOKE 
IT WAS DESIGNED FROM THE GROUND UP TO BE A THRILL A MINUTE SPORTS CAR 
THIS IS THE ONLY ONE WITH REAR WHEEL DRIVE 
IT IS A PROPER BLUE BLOODED DRIVER'S CAR 
LISTEN TO THAT SEVEN EIGHT NINE 
AND YET DESPITE ALL THAT IT HAS FOUR DOORS 
YOU SEE YOU GOT YOUR BIG DOOR AT THE FRONT USUAL SORT OF THING 
AND THEN YOU HAVE A LITTLE DOOR FOR BACK SEAT PASSENGERS LOOK AT THAT 
IT'S BRILLIANT 
THERE ARE A FEW DISADVANTAGES I ADMIT 
YOU WILL STRUGGLE TO GET MORE THAN TWENTY THREE M. P. G. 
IT USES QUITE A LOT OF OIL 
AND THE DEPRECIATION IS A BIT STEEP 
BUT THEN AN R. X. EIGHT IS TWO THOUSAND CHEAPER TO BUY THAN THE OTHERS 
AND TWO THOUSAND TIMES BETTER AND I DON'T CARE WHAT THOSE OTHER IDIOTS SAY 
A TRICKY DECISION THEN 
THREE SIMILAR CARS BUT THREE DIFFERENT OPINIONS 
TO SEE IF WE COULD FIND A WINNER THE THREE OF US NEEDED TO MEET UP 
SO THIS BEING SCOTLAND 
THE HOME OF GOLF WE DECIDED TO BREAK OUT THE PRINGLE 
WHAT WILL YOU BE USING HERE 
HOW THE HELL DO I KNOW I HAVE NEVER EVER PLAYED GOLF 
IT'S LIKE THAT ISN'T IT 
YOU SEEM TO LOOK LIKE SOMEBODY WHO'D DONE IT 
YOU GOT DRESSED UP IN THAT OUTFIT TO DO THAT 
I COULD HAVE CARRIED IT THAT FAR 
THAT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT 
HOW CAN IT NOT LOOK RIGHT 
SHUT UP WATCH AND LEARN 
IT'S GONE IN THE SEA 
IT'S GONE IN THE SEA 
I TELL YOU WHAT RICHARD YOUR MAZDA WOULD LOOK GOOD HERE 
GET OFF IT IS NOT A GOLFIST'S CAR 
IT IS I'M FAIRLY CONFIDENT WE WON'T SEE AN ALFA ROMEO IN THE CAR PARK 
NO WE WON'T BUT I COULD SEE YOUR CAR AS WELL 
A T. T. YEAH 
T. T. IS A CAR FOR THE KIND OF MAN WHO MATCHES HIS BELT TO THE TAG ON HIS TROUSERS AND IS PLEASED WITH THAT 
HE'S DOING IT AGAIN 
I'M GOING TO KILL HIM 
THAT WASN'T BAD WELL IT WAS 
I'VE JUST GOT A HOLE IN TWENTY ONE 
WE WERE EXTREMELY QUICK AT GETTING TO A NEW HOLE 
OH NO O. O. O. 
WELL DONE 
BUT EVERY TIME WE GOT THERE 
YES 
ARE YOU USING AN S. 
PARTLY BECAUSE WE WERE USELESS AND PARTLY BECAUSE WE KEPT ARGUING ABOUT OUR CARS' 
THAT MAZDA IS CHINTZY 
CHINTZY I'M SORRY BOTH OF YOUR CARS ARE POMPOUS 
RUBBISH RUBBISH RUBBISH 
RUBBISH RUBBISH DO YOU WANT ME TO KEEP SAYING RUBBISH 
THIS ANNOYED THE PROPER MEN OF PRINGLE WHO WERE QUEUING UP BEHIND US' 
THERE'S NO RUCHED LEATHER IN THE AUDI 
THERE'S PEOPLE BEHIND US I AM TRYING TO GET ON WITH IT I KNOW 
NO 
AFTER AN HOUR WE REACHED THE THIRD HOLE AND WERE STILL ARGUING 
THE MAZDA MAY BE GOOD TECHNICALLY BUT IT'S NOT WHAT IT'S ABOUT ON THE ROAD IT'S TOO JIGGLY AND HARSH 
JIGGLY JUST BECAUSE THE ALFA IS SLIGHTLY SLOWER 
IT'S NOT SLIGHTLY SLOWER JAMES 
IN THE WAY IT FEELS THE BALANCE THE RIDE THE LITTLE NIGGLES 
HOW FAR CAN I HIT HIS HEAD UP ITS FUNDAMENT LIKE YOURS HAVE 
THAT'S JUST CHILDISH AND DOESN'T SOLVE THE ARGUMENT 
AFTER THIS WE WERE ASKED TO LEAVE 
AND ALL WE HAD MANAGED TO AGREE ON IS THAT THE ALFA WAS THE LEAST GOLF CLUBBISH 
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE GOING TO PICK THAT UP LATER ON 
BUT NOW IT'S TIME TO PUT A STAR IN OUR REASONABLY PRICED CAR 
OUR GUEST IS A GLOBAL MEGASTAR 
HE'S MADE HIS NAME PLAYING THE KIND OF DITHERING ENGLISHMAN WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE 
SO I GUESS IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME WHEN HE'S ASKED TO PLAY THE LEAD IN JAMES MAY THE MOVIE 
PLEASE WELCOME TO THIS POKY MOTORING SHOW HUGH GRANT 
HAVE A SEAT 
HAVE A SEAT 
GREAT OF YOU TO COME 
THIS IS A THRILL FOR ME IT'S A THRILL FOR ME 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN AN INTERVIEW WE'VE GIRLS ALL AROUND THE FRONT 
NORMALLY AT THIS POINT THEY'RE ALL OUTSIDE TALKING TO HAMMOND BUT NOW HE'S OUTSIDE ALL BY HIMSELF 
STARTING OFF WITH CARS 
BIG HOLLYWOOD STAR SO I PRESUME YOU'VE GOT A TOYOTA PRIUS 
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT BUT UM NO 
IN MY LIFE I'VE HAD TWO MODES OF CAR 
LITTLE TINY TOSSERS' CARS 
AND A GREAT BIG CARS 
YOU ARE IN WHICH MODE NOW 
FOR THE FIRST TIME I AM RIDING BETWEEN THE TWO 
THE TOSSERS' CARS BEGAN WITH A CITROEN DYANE 
AND I DON'T THINK YOU CAN GET MUCH TOSSIER THAN THAT 
THE GREAT THING IS THAT YOU CAN CRASH IT AND NOBODY EVER KNEW 
THERE WERE SO MANY DIFFERENT ANGLES ON IT ALSO YOU COULDN'T 
HURT ANYONE BECAUSE IT HAD THE POWER OF FOUR HARNESSED CHILDREN 
THEN YOU GOT INTO THE KIND AS YOU PUT IT CARS WHICH STARTED WITH 
WELL IT STARTED WITH AN ASTON MARTIN VANQUISH WHICH IS A BEAUTIFUL CAR 
AND YOU WANT TO LICK IT OR MATE WITH IT OR SOMETHING 
BUT I NEVER REALLY WANTED TO DRIVE IT VERY MUCH 
BECAUSE THE GEARS JUST OCCASIONALLY WHEN YOU WERE FEELING HAPPY IN YOUR CAR 
WOULD SEIZE UP IT WOULD STOP AND YOU COULDN'T EVEN PUSH IT TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD 
YOU WERE THERE ON THE A THREE SIXTEEN WITH PEOPLE GOING PAST MAKING SIGNS 
A LOVELY CAR THEN IT WAS A BENTLEY YEAH 
I HAD A FOOTBALLER'S CAR A BENTLEY G. T. CONTINENTAL 
VERY NICE AGAIN BUT I'VE GOT A BAD BACK 
AND FOR SOME REASON IT MANIFESTS ITSELF AS BACK PAIN AND SOMETIMES AS BOLLOCK PAIN 
AND WITH THE G. T. I GOT TERRIBLE BOLLOCK PAIN 
SOME CAR SEATS DO IT TO ME 
MY BROTHER'S GOLF G. T. I. WAS THE FIRST ONE HENCE THE SYNDROME IS NOW KNOWN AS GOLF BALL 
I GOT IT VERY BADLY WITH THE G. T. SO THAT HAD TO GO BACK AFTER SIX MONTHS 
BECAUSE OF YOUR TESTICLES YES I DIDN'T SAY THAT TO THE GARAGE 
AFTER THE BENTLEY WAS 
THEN I HAD A BEAUTIFUL PORSCHE WHICH I PHONED YOU ABOUT 
NO YOUR GIRLFRIEND PHONED ME UP AND SAID I HAVE TO GET HUGH A CAR 
A PORSCHE THAT'S WRONG FOR A START ANYWAY SHE WAS ADAMANT IT WAS GOING TO BE A PORSCHE 
AND WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER IT WAS GOING TO BE AN AUTOMATIC OR MANUAL I SAID AUTOMATIC 
YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND OF COURSE I GOT THE MANUAL 
IT'S SO EXHAUSTING ALL I WANT IS A COMFY ENVIRONMENT AND A NICE ARMCHAIR AND FOR MY BALLS NOT TO HURT 
IT'S NOT ASKING MUCH OF A CAR THE PORSCHE ALSO HAS THE INTERESTING THING I THINK IT'S FINE 
IF THE STEERING WHEEL IS ON THE LEFT FOR THE GERMANS BUT ON THE RIGHT FOR THE BRITS SOMETHING'S WRONG 
THE PETROL TANK IS IN THE WRONG PLACE SO YOU'RE FACING FORWARD LIKE THIS AND YOUR LOWER BODY IS HERE 
SO YOU ARE LOOKING DIRECTLY LEFT AND I FOUND THAT TRICKY THAT IS TRICKY 
I ONCE HAD THAT IN A LANCIA STRATOS BUT ANNOYINGLY ALL OF YOU FACE THIS WAY 
WHILE TRAVELLING 
IT REALLY DOES MAKE THE SENSATION OF SPEED IS TREMENDOUS BUT YOU HIT THINGS QUITE OFTEN 
NOW YOUR DRIVING HOW'S THAT 
DO YOU HAVE ROAD RAGE 
TERRIBLE YES AND ER 
IT'S ROAD RAGE THAT THEN BECOMES TERRIBLE ROAD MEEKNESS IN AN INSTANT 
THERE WAS A GUY THAT GAVE ME THE LIGHTEST OF KNOCKS AND I WENT INTO COMPLETE MELTDOWN 
AND I ATTACKED HIM AND WHEN HE WOULDN'T GET OUT OF HIS CAR I THOUGHT I'LL ATTACK THE CAR 
I RIPPED THE WINDSCREEN WIPERS RIGHT OFF HIS CAR AMAZED AT MY OWN STRENGTH 
AND HE SAID YOU'VE RIPPED THE WINDSCREEN WIPERS OFF MY CAR 
IMMEDIATELY I WAS I'M SO SORRY 
I SAID I WOULD DRIVE HIM TO A GARAGE IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE ANGRY FOLLOW IT THROUGH 
I ONCE TOLD SOMEONE 
WHO HAD A DOG IN A HOTEL NEXT TO WHERE I WAS STAYING THAT KEPT BARKING AT FIVE A M. 
I GOT UP AND HADN'T PLANNED IF YOU DON'T PLAN WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO SAY IT ALL GOES WRONG 
I GOT OUT AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY AND I SAID I'VE KILLED BEFORE 
MY WIFE WAS SAYING WHAT HAVE YOU KILLED BEFORE ANYWAY 
LET'S TALK ABOUT FILMS IF WE MAY 
THE NEW FILM O. K. IS YOU AND DREW BARRYMORE YES SIR IT'S CALLED 
MUSIC AND LYRICS 
WE NEVER NORMALLY DO PLUGGING ON THE SHOW BUT HAVE YOU GOT ANY CLIPS HERE 
THAT DOESN'T WORK DOES IT WE DO HAVE A CLIP 
I PLAY THIS EX EIGHTIES POP STAR WHO HAS FALLEN ON HARD TIMES 
AND I GET A NEW CONTRACT TO WRITE A SONG FOR A FAMOUS SINGER I WRITE MUSIC 
I CAN'T FIND ANYONE TO WRITE THE LYRICS UNTIL I COME ACROSS THIS GIRL DREW BARRYMORE 
AND WE WRITE THIS SONG TOGETHER IN THE CLIP WE SEE WE ARE JUST MAKING A LITTLE DEMO TAPE 
IT SOUNDS SO GOOD I CAN'T BELIEVE IT 
NO YOU SEE YOU HAVE TO SING INTO THE MICROPHONE 
IT WON'T FOLLOW YOU BUT I CAN'T 
IT'S A DUET FOR A MAN AND A WOMAN 
WE ARE AS CLOSE AS WE'VE GOT YOUR HEADPHONES AND A LEVEL 
YOU LOOK NICE IN THOSE 
HOW IS THAT 
YES O. K. SHUSH SHUSH SHUSH 
IT'S O. K. AND 
WAY BACK INTO LOVE TAKE ONE 
I'M GETTING REALLY NERVOUS 
JUST USE YOUR NORMAL NICE VOICE THAT I'VE HEARD SO MUCH OF IN THE LAST THREE DAYS 
MY THROAT IS CLOSING UP UGH 
IT'S FINE IT'S JUST A THREE MINUTE SONG 
I'VE BEEN LIVING WITH A SHADOW OVERHEAD 
JUST A LITTLE LOUDER BECAUSE THIS SONG IS INTENDED FOR HUMANS O. K. 
VERY GOOD 
IT'S A ROMANTIC COMEDY JEREMY WHICH IS SOMETHING I'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE SO 
I LIKE TO STRETCH MYSELF IT'S ALL ABOUT DISCOVERY AND TRYING NEW STUFF 
I THINK IT'S A LOVELY FUNNY FILM AND IT OPENS ON NINTH FEBRUARY 
CAN I JUST ASK YOU WE ARE THE SAME AGE GIVE OR TAKE 
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE TO LOOK AT US 
FRANKLY IT IS YEAH ARE YOU STARTING TO FALL TO PIECES YET 
YES I AM YES I AM JEREMY YES 
WORST BIT FOR ME IS WHEN YOU'RE 
YOU'VE SHAVED YOU'RE RINSING YOUR FACE LIKE THIS AND YOU LOOK UP INTO THE MIRROR 
AND I HAVE ONE TO THE SIDE 
AND MY EYES LOOK UP AND MY FACE IS STILL POINTING DOWN 
THAT'S HELL ALSO DIDN'T YOU HAVE TROUBLE WITH YOUR BOTTOM 
THAT WAS A TERRIBLE MOMENT YEAH 
FUNNILY ENOUGH IT WAS FOR GOLF BALL 
I WENT TO SEE A DOCTOR IN HARLEY STREET AND I WAS SUSPICIOUS OF HIM 
BECAUSE HE SAID IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SLIP ALL YOUR CLOTHES OFF 
AND I TOOK THEM ALL OFF AND THEN HE INTERVIEWED ME 
I SAT NAKED AS A BABY IN FRONT OF HIM IN A VERY EXPENSIVE BIG CONSULTATION ROOM WHILE HE WROTE DOWN THINGS 
AND HE SAID RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO DO A QUICK PROSTATE EXAMINATION 
BENT ME OVER AND I SWEAR TO GOD STUCK HIS HEAD UP MY BOTTOM 
BECAUSE WHEN HE SAID DOES THAT HURT IT WAS MUFFLED 
IT WAS DOES THAT HURT 
IT WAS THE WORST PAIN I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE 
I WANT TO GET ON TO YOUR LAP OBVIOUSLY HOW DID IT GO THERE 
I THOUGHT QUITE BADLY 
I LIKE THE STIG VERY MUCH 
HE WAS VERY KIND TO ME BUT IT'S NOT EASY 
IT'S NOT EASY YOU DIDN'T THINK SO 
NO BECAUSE IT'S COUNTERINTUITIVE 
JUST WHEN YOU ARE THINKING NOW I'M GOING TO DIE SO I'LL BRAKE 
HE SAYS FLAT DOWN WITH THE ACCELERATOR AND THE OTHER WAY AROUND 
AND I KNOW I'M GOING TO BE BAD 
WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE HUGH'S LAP YES PLAY THE TAPE 
THIS IS YOU AND THERE YOU GO 
WHAT A CAR 
VERY UNATTRACTIVE HELMET 
DON'T CHANGE GEAR YOU 
THAT CANNOT BE MY BEST 
THAT WAS VERY GOOD THROUGH THERE EXCELLENT WHERE ARE YOU GOING NOW THOUGH 
HAMMER HEAD LOOKING SMOOTH 
I HAVE NEVER MASTERED THAT IS THAT A PENALTY 
NO THAT'S GOOD 
OH WHAT A PIECE OF ART 
OH 
SOON YOU ARE GOING TO CUT INSIDE AND YOU WON'T BE SWEARING 
EVERY TIME I CAME WOBBLING THROUGH A TURN THERE WAS ANOTHER EX B. B. C. CAMERAMAN RIGHT IN MY WAY 
DID EXACTLY THE WRONG THING AGAIN 
LAST CORNER THIS IS VERY GOOD THAT'S GOOD AND WIDE OH 
RIGHT ACROSS THE LINE 
I KNOW IT'S NOT GOOD I FEEL I'VE LET EVERYONE DOWN INCLUDING THE STIG ONLY YOURSELF 
WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'VE COME ON THE BOARD I WISH I KNEW 
I WOULDN'T LIKE TO COME LOWER THAN MICHAEL GAMBON 
MICHAEL GAMBON YOU BEAT HIM 
THAT'S GOOD 
IN THAT CASE I'D QUITE LIKE TO BEAT EWAN MCGREGOR 
WELL YOU ACTUALLY DID IT IN ONE MINUTE YES 
FORTY YES 
SEVEN YES POINT SEVEN 
OH HELLO CONGRATULATIONS 
YOU ARE IN FACT ONLY OH ONE SECOND BEHIND THE WELL SPOKEN MAN 
YES YES ANYWAY SO THERE YOU ARE 
JAMIE OLIVER WAS IN THE SNOW SO HE MOVES UP IS THAT RIGHT 
NO IT HAD MELTED IT HAD MELTED THE SNOW 
HE CLAIMS IT WAS SNOW AND WE'VE PUNISHED HIM YES 
I THINK YOU'RE BETTER AND FUNNIER AND MUCH BETTER LOOKING WITH A SMALLER TONGUE 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN HUGH GRANT 
RIGHT EARLIER WE WERE TESTING THREE COUPES TO DECIDE WHICH ONE IS BEST 
I REALLY REALLY LIKE THIS ALFA ROMEO BRERA 
CLARKSON STUPIDLY PREFERS THIS NEW AUDI T. T. 
AND THE DAMN FOOL HAMMOND SEEMS TO THINK IT SHOULD BE THIS MAZDA R. X. EIGHT 
SO FAR WE HAVE ESTABLISHED PRETTY MUCH NOTHING 
BUT NOW IN THE SECOND PART OF THE FILM WE ARE DRIVING TO EDINBURGH AND STILL ARGUING 
CAN YOU SET THE SATNAV IN YOUR CAR O. K. 
NO I HAVEN'T GOT SATNAV 
CAN YOU DO THAT RICHARD 
I GO BY INSTINCT IN THE END 
SO IT'S THE DRIVER'S CAR OR THE NAVIGATOR'S CAR 
OR THE AIR HOSTESS'S IN THE CASE OF YOURS JEREMY 
I THINK I HAVE A BIT OF DUST ON MY HEAD LAMP SO I'LL WASH IT OFF 
I'VE DONE THAT WITH MY HEAD LAMP WASHERS HAVE YOU DONE THAT JAMES 
I DID THAT EARLIER WITH A HANKY AND THE END OF MY FINGER 
HAVE EITHER OF YOU TWO GOT A D. S. G. GEARBOX NO NO 
HAVE YOU GOT ADJUSTABLE SUSPENSION EITHER OF YOU 
NO NO 
BUT THEN I FIRED A TORPEDO STRAIGHT INTO THE SIDE OF H. M. S. CLARKSON 
JEREMY CAN I JUST ASK HOW MUCH OF THAT STUFF IS STANDARD 
ALMOST EVERYTHING REALLY IS AN OPTIONAL EXTRA 
HOW MUCH DOES THAT LOT COST THE OPTIONAL EXTRAS ON THIS CAR 
ADD UP TO ISH THOUSAND POUNDS HOW MUCH 
SI SIX THOUSAND POUNDS 
SIX GRAND 
IT'S ACTUALLY EIGHT GRAND BUT SHUSH 
IT WAS TIT FOR TAT ALL THE WAY AND NOBODY WAS GOING TO GIVE IN 
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THIS THE CAR YOU REALLY WANT 
LOOKS LIKE THE ALFA DRIVES LIKE THE MAZDA AND IS BUILT LIKE THE AUDI 
SINCE THAT DOESN'T EXIST YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE AUDI 
COS IT'S THE BEST ALL ROUNDER THE BEST COMPROMISE AND THAT 
THAT'S AN END OF IT 
IT WASN'T THE END THOUGH 
COUPES ARE ALL ABOUT LOOKS AND TO FIND OUT WHICH OF OURS WAS THE BEST LOOKING 
WE HAD BEEN TOLD TO GO TO THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL GALLERY OF MODERN ART IN EDINBURGH 
THE CHALLENGE WAS SIMPLE 
IF THIS PRESTIGIOUS GALLERY WAS TO ACCEPT JUST ONE OF OUR CARS 
BASED ON STYLING ALONE WHICH WOULD IT BE 
A PANEL OF EXPERTS HAD BEEN ASSEMBLED TO MAKE THE CHOICE 
TO HELP THINGS ALONG WE HAD EACH BEEN GIVEN TWO MINUTES 
TO ARGUE THE ARTISTIC MERITS OF OUR PARTICULAR CAR BUT BEFORE THAT 
FIVE MINUTES IN THE GALLERY BOOKSHOP TO BONE UP ON ART A BIT 
IS THERE ANYTHING JAPANESE AT ALL 
DO YOU HAVE A SINGLE VOLUME ON THE ARTISTIC INFLUENCE OF ALFA ROMEO COUPES 
JAPANESE CULTURE MAY BE LIKENED TO AN OYSTER 
OPENING ITSELF UP TO REPEATED ONSLAUGHTS FROM THE 
OYSTER 
UNFORTUNATELY THE CRASH COURSE IN THE BOOKSHOP JUST CONFUSED US EVEN MORE 
AS THE EXPERTS DISCOVERED WHEN JAMES KICKED THINGS OFF 
GOOD AFTERNOON PROFESSORS 
I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ASKING THE QUESTION CAN A CAR BE A PIECE OF ART 
I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT I THINK NO 
THAT IS NOT A PIECE OF ART BUT CAN WE FIND ART IN THAT DESIGN 
I'LL PUT IT DOWN THERE 
CAN I REALLY ARGUE THAT THE AUDI T. T. WAS A REACTION 
TO THE OVERCOMPLICATED CEILING ROSE OF VICTORIAN HOUSES 
FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN SEE IN THE LIGHTS OF THE ALFA ROMEO I THINK THE INFLUENCE 
OF THE SCOTTISH COLOURISTS NAMELY FERGUSSON AND PEPLOE 
YOU WENT TO ART SCHOOL YOU SHOULD BE GOOD AT THIS 
DID YOU GO TO ART SCHOOL NO THEN YOU WOULDN'T KNOW ALL YOU DO IS DRINK AND PURSUE WOMEN 
ALL ART SHOULD BE ABOUT TWO THINGS TRUTH AND BEAUTY 
IT'S TRUE BECAUSE IT'S REAL IT'S NOT A PIECE OF ART 
HOW DO WE SHUT THIS MAN UP 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE MADE AMPHIBIOUS CARS 
A CONVERTIBLE PEOPLE CARRIER I HAVE RACED YOU TO OSLO THIS IS THE HARDEST THING I HAVE FACED 
HE HAS GIVEN THE IMPRESSION HE HAS TAKEN HIS BRUSH OR EVEN HIS CALLIGRAPHY PEN 
I THINK WE HAVE PROBABLY HEARD ENOUGH IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU THANK YOU 
I WANTED TO TALK OF THE RENAISSANCE AND THE MEANING OF TRUTH LET'S LEAVE THAT FOR ANOTHER DAY 
THESE TROUSERS ARE NOT BAUHAUS 
WERE WE MADE TO LOOK A BIT LIKE A MONKEY THEIR BRAINS ARE BIG 
JUSTIFY WHY YOU THINK YOUR CAR SHOULD BE IN THIS GALLERY 
ONE CAN SEE INFLUENCES OF THE BAUHAUS THINKING IN SO MANY OF THE THINGS AROUND US TODAY 
SOME OF THE DESIGN CLASSICS LIKE THE VARIOUS DESIGNER CHAIRS 
WHY IS HE TALKING ABOUT CHAIRS 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING SOMEWHERE IT'S PURPOSEFUL 
THAT IS THE INSIDE OF THE MAZDA THAT IS NOT BAUHAUS 
THAT'S MY TROUSERS 
I HAVE FOUND HIS NOTES TROUSERS FAT HITLER TIGER MAZDA ALFA MODERNISM MINIMALISM 
MINIMALISM MODERNISM I THINK IT CREATED CUBISM 
CUBISM CAME ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS EARLIER BUT GO ON 
I THINK THE AUDI IS BAUHAUS BUT IT HAS A VERY CONTEMPORARY VENEER 
ONE SHOULDN'T HANG THE WHOLE ARGUMENT ON THE BAUHAUS 
E.'S IST EINFACH NICHT WAHR AS THEY SAID OF THE BAUHAUS IT'S JUST NOT TRUE 
WHAT DOES IT SYMBOLISE 
THE AUDI SYMBOLISES 
FREEDOM 
FREEDOM LIKE THAT 
WARM IN THERE ISN'T IT 
GENTLEMEN GOD IS THE REASON WHY YOU MIGHT LOOK AT THIS CAR 
THE MAZDA R. X. EIGHT AND SEE IT AS SOMETHING A BIT UNUSUAL 
THE MAZDA IS A JAPANESE CAR 
IN UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY THIS CAR IS DIFFERENT TO OUR EYES 
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT EXPRESSED THROUGHOUT JAPANESE CULTURE AND PAINTINGS 
YOU PUT YOUR HAND IN YOUR POCKET YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY REFERRING TO NOTES I CAN DO THAT 
IF YOU REFER TO CATCHING CATFISH WITH A GOURD 
FROM THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY BY ER JU JITSU 
ONE OF THE BLOKES IN THERE IS AN EXPERT IN JAPANESE AND ORIENTAL ART 
CAN YOU JUST REITERATE SOME OF THOSE POINTS 
WHICH POINTS THE ONES YOU JUST MADE 
DID YOU FEEL A BIT THICK THICK HOW DO YOU THINK HE'S GONNA FEEL 
HE'LL PROBABLY PUNCH ONE I HAVE EATEN BRIGHTER VEGETABLES 
YOU PUT THIS CAR IN A GALLERY 
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE IN THE ENVIRONMENT 
MAYBE TO HAVE SOME OTHER JAPANESE STUFF IN THERE 
DO YOU HAVE ANY EXAMPLES THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE OF VALUE 
SOME JAPANESE PAINTINGS BY ANYONE IN PARTICULAR 
THAT WOULD BE FOR PERHAPS YOU KNOW SPECIALISTS TO CHOOSE 
HOW DID THAT GO 
I THINK WELL I THINK WELL 
DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE BRIGHT RED YEAH I'M HOT VERY HOT 
THE BOFFINS CONFERRED AND THEN CALLED US ALL IN TO GIVE THEIR VERDICTS 
I THINK THE AUDI IS SORT OF CONSTRAINED IT IS MODEST 
IT IS TIDY BUT IT'S NOT SAYING VERY MUCH TO ME 
THIS LESSNESS IS LESS FOR ME NOT MORE 
I'M MOST PERSUADED BY THE ALFA 
I AGREE ENTIRELY 
THE MAZDA LOOKING AT IT FROM VARIOUS ANGLES 
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AS CLEAN CUT AN EXPRESSION 
OF WHAT THE MODERN AUTOMOTIVE COUPE IS AND I THINK THAT IS THE ALFA 
IN TERMS OF THE LOOK THE STYLE EVERYTHING IT DENOTES 
WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO SHOW THAT CAR IN THIS GALLERY THE ALFA ROMEO 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT IT WOULD BREAK DOWN BEFORE IT GOT HERE 
YOU WOULD GET OIL ALL OVER YOUR NICE FLOOR 
STOP BEING PETTY 
THESE THREE MEN ARE EXPERTS IN ART AND ARTISTIC EXPRESSION 
IT'S ONLY COS I SAID FREEDOM THAT'S WHAT WAS WRONG 
AS RICHARD SAID THEY WERE WRONG SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO DO A MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TEST 
WHICH IS THE FASTEST ROUND OUR TRACK 
OBVIOUSLY TO FIND THAT OUT WE HAVE TO HAND THEM OVER TO OUR TRAINED RACING DRIVER 
SOME SAY HE ONCE HAD A VICIOUS KNIFE FIGHT WITH ANTHEA TURNER 
AND THAT HE IS IN NO WAY IMPLICATED IN THE CASH FOR HONOURS SCANDAL 
ALL WE KNOW IS HE'S CALLED LORD STIG 
THAT'S WASTED ABOUT AN HOUR WITH WHEEL SPIN 
HE'S STARTING IN THE ONLY PROPER SPORTS CAR THE MAZDA 
REAR WHEEL DRIVE IT FEELS LIKE A SPORTS CAR BECAUSE IT WAS DESIGNED AS A SPORTS CAR 
LUCY LOOKED AT HIM AT HIS STRONG KIND FACE AND THE ENDEARING LOOK IN HIS EYES 
IT'S HIS ROMANTIC FICTION HE'S INTO IT NOW 
LOOK AT THAT IT IS SO CONTROLLED YOU CAN STEER IT WITH THE REAR END 
IS IT MOVING RUBBISH IT'S FAST MATE 
LOOK AT THAT IT'S LIKE THAT'S MILES OFF 
THAT'S ELEGANT AND CONTROLLED THAT REALLY IS 
HE'LL BE ENJOYING THAT THAT'S FAMILIAR TERRITORY FOR HIM FORTY 
IT LOOKS AT HOME ON A TRACK UNLIKE THE OT H. E. R. T. WO 
HE HAD TO LIFT OFF THERE FORTY FIVE LOOK AT THAT BRAKING 
LAST BUT ONE CORNER FINAL CORNER 
UNDER CONTROL 
WHAT A SPECTACLE 
GOOD FRONT END GRIP GOOD BALANCE EXCELLENT BRAKES 
DID YOU SEE THAT DIVE IT'S LIKE WATCHING THE STUDIO GO ROUND 
THAT'S BALANCE AND POISE 
ARE YOU GOING TO TELL US IT'S THE MOST PRACTICAL CAR 
IT IS YOU CAN GET TWO IN THE FRONT AND TWO IN THE BACK AND A SET OF GOLF BATS IN THE BOOT VERY USEFUL 
WE KNOW IT IS NO GOOD FOR GOLF BECAUSE IT IS THE LEAST PRINGLEY 
IT IS NOT TURNED AT ALL THERE LOOK AT THAT 
HE'S USING ALL THE TRACK HE NEEDS ALL THE TRACK 
HERE WE GO IT WILL JUST CRASH NOW NO 
BEAUTIFUL HERE HE GOES UNDERSTEERED 
NO HE'S PULLED IT IN 
OUT OF CONTROL 
OIL COMING OUT OF THE BOTTOM RIGHT GENTLEMEN BEHOLD THE MAGNIFICENT 
OFF TO THE HAIRDRESSER SIR 
I KNOW YOU ARE THINKING THIS IS THE OLD T. T. 
DON'T MUDDLE THEM UP THAT WAS FOR AIR HOSTESSES PEOPLE WHO'RE ORANGE THIS IS A NEW MODEL 
THIS IS ONLY THE FRONT WHEEL DRIVE ONE THE BABY ONE 
FRONT WHEEL DRIVE 
YOU JUST SAW THE BACK COMING ROUND THERE 
I SAW THE FRONT NOD 
LOOK AT THIS COMPARED TO YOUR ONE JAMES IT'S WORSE 
THAT'S SO SLOW IT'S NOT WORSE HE'S ALMOST ON THE GRASS 
HONESTLY THIS IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ANIMAL THAN THE ONE WE USED TO HAVE 
THIS IS FAST YES NO 
ONLY THE TWO LITRE ONE JUST THE BABY THE V. SIX IS NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THIS 
WE COME TO THE FINAL CORNER 
IT'S GONNA CRASH 
IT'S AIRBORNE 
RIGHT 
READY 
TIME FOR THE AUDI 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE POINT FOUR CHECK IT OUT 
I WOULDN'T BE SO CONFIDENT MY CAR I THINK ON A RACE TRACK YOU WILL FIND THAT 
FIVE SECONDS 
LISTEN YOU CAN STOP BEING QUITE SO COCKY ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOUR AUDI HASN'T WON ANYTHING YET 
IT'S NOT THE BEST LOOKING IT'S THE MOST EXPENSIVE 
NOT THE MOST PRACTICAL WE ARE ABOUT TO FIND IT OUT IT ISN'T THE FASTEST WHEN MY MAZDA BEATS IT 
OH DAMN YOU'VE WON I'VE LOST 
I WILL OWN UP NOW SECRETLY ALL ALONG I HAVE PREFERRED THE ALFA 
WHAT NO SERIOUSLY IF IT WERE MY MONEY THAT'S WHAT I'D BUY 
AND I BET YOU ANY MONEY IT'S THE SAME FOR YOU YES I KNEW IT 
BEFORE YOU GET TOO COCKY I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ONE TO A FRIEND THAT'S THE THING YOU WOULDN'T 
THEY WOULD SPEND THE REST OF THEIR LIFE IN A CLOUD OF STEAM AT THE SIDE OF THE MOTORWAY 
I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND ONE WOULD YOU NO I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND ONE NO 
WOULD YOU NO ALL RIGHT 
THERE YOU ARE WHAT WE HAVE MANAGED TO ESTABLISH IS THE BEST CAR HERE IS THE WORST 
WE'RE GOOD AT THIS WE ARE AND THAT IS THE END OF THE SHOW
