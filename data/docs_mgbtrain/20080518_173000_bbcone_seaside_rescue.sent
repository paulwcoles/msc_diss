WHAT HAVE YOU HAD NOW 
PILOT JOHN ROONEY AND HIS CREW ARE ABOUT TO SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE 
WHISKY BRAVO'S BEEN SCRAMBLED 
THE MAST ON A YACHT HAS COLLAPSED 
THE RIGGING HAS RIPPED LOOSE A CABLE AND SLASHED THROUGH A CREW MEMBER'S LEG LIKE A CHEESE WIRE 
RESCUE WHISKY BRAVO 
WE'VE BEEN TOLD IT'S BEEN SEVERED TO THE BONE OVER 
IF THE CABLE HAS SLICED A MAIN ARTERY A PINT OF BLOOD CAN BE LOST EVERY THIRTY SECONDS 
THERE'S QUITE A FEW YACHTS AHEAD OF US HERE WHICH IS NOT WHAT WE NEED 
THE YACHT IS TAKING PART IN A RACE AND FINDING THE CASUALTY AMIDST THIS SEA OF SAILS WON'T BE EASY 
GOT THE POWER ON A BIT SUNNY 
CAN YOU HEAR ME O. K. 
WHISKY BRAVO THE VESSEL WE'RE COMMUNICATING WITH 
IS CALLED TWIN WAKES HE'S STANDING BY 
SOMEWHERE THE RACE ORGANISER IS CIRCLING THE CASUALTY 
IN THE HOPE THAT WHISKY BRAVO WILL SPOT THEM 
WHISKY BRAVO TWIN WAKES 
IF YOU WILL TURN RIGHT I HAVE A MAN ON THE REAR DECK POINTING 
THERE'S ONE WITH HIS HANDS WIDE OPEN ON THE DECK OF THE CASUALTY VESSEL 
BUT WHISKY BRAVO CAN'T GET A FIX ON THEM 
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE 
IF THEY DON'T FIND THE CASUALTY SOON HE COULD BLEED TO DEATH 
GOOD AFTERNOON CORNWALL IT LOOKS AS IF THE CLOUDS HAVE FINALLY PARTED AND THE SUN IS PUSHING THROUGH 
GET DOWN ON THE BEACH WHILE IT LASTS AND REMEMBER TO BE SAFE OUT THERE 
THE SUN HAS FINALLY BROUGHT OUT THE SURF LOVERS AT PERRANPORTH BEACH 
THE RNLI HAVE GOT THEIR WORK CUT OUT KEEPING IT ALL SAFE 
THE SURF IS SO UNPREDICTABLE A SUDDEN CHANGE CAN HAPPEN IN SECONDS 
ONE MINUTE YOU CAN HAVE A NICE CALM DAY AND ALL OF A SUDDEN FLASH RIPS UNDERCURRENTS 
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN WITHIN SECONDS 
PERRANPORTH IS RENOWNED FOR ITS STRONG CURRENTS THAT CAN DRAG A SWIMMER OUT TO SEA 
LIFEGUARD LUKE ESSERY HAS GOT TO PLAY IT TOUGH 
TO KEEP THE WAVE LOVERS FROM WANDERING OUT BEYOND THE FLAGS 
SANDY HILL IS ON THE JET SKI AS BACK UP 
AND ALREADY SHE HAS SPOTTED A SURFER IN DISTRESS 
HE'S CAUGHT IN A RIP CURRENT 
IF SANDY DOESN'T GET TO HIM HE'LL BE DRAGGED FURTHER AND FURTHER OUT TO SEA 
CLIMB ON CLIMB ON 
THE CURRENT JUST TOOK YOUR FEET FROM UNDER YOU 
THERE WAS NO WAY YOU COULD GET YOUR FEET BACK ON THE GROUND 
AND THE WAVES JUST GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND POUNDING YOU 
YOU GET TIRED VERY VERY QUICKLY WITHOUT REALISING IT 
AND ONCE I STARTED DRIFTING THAT WAS IT 
I JUST COULDN'T GET BACK IN AT ALL 
THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU CAN FIGHT AGAINST IT IT'S JUST TOO MUCH 
THIS IS NOT A GOOD SIGN 
WITH A RIP CURRENT JUST OUTSIDE THE FLAG ZONE ANYONE WHO STRAYS COULD GET INTO DANGER 
IT GETS REALLY FRUSTRATING AND GETS ON OUR NERVES A FAIR BIT 
THEY DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION 
THEY JUST THINK THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
PRETTY MUCH THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WE ARE ALWAYS RESCUING 
LUKE AND SANDY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LAY DOWN THE LAW 
IF YOU WOULD TURN RIGHT COME BACK TOWARDS US 
WHISKY BRAVO IS STILL LOOKING FOR THE MAN WITH A SEVERE LEG INJURY 
HE'S JUST BEHIND US OVER THERE HE IS 
ANY BLOOD LOSS MUST BE STEMMED BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN THINK OF MOVING HIM 
SHALL I JUST ORBIT FOR THE MOMENT JOHN NO COME DOWN NEXT TO HIM 
JOHN SPENCER MUST GET DOWN TO PUT PRESSURE ON THAT WOUND 
THE WINCH OPERATOR SIGNALS TO THE RACE ORGANISER TO GET OUT OF THE WAY 
IN THAT POSITION HE'S GOING TO BE A BATTLE TO GET IN THE AIRCRAFT QUITE A FEW YACHTS AHEAD OF US JOHN 
WHISKY BRAVO WILL CONDUCT THE WINCH FROM A GREATER HEIGHT THAN NORMAL 
TO STOP THE CASUALTY FROM BEING BLASTED BY THE DOWN WASH 
FORTY FIVE FORTY FEET CLEAR THE WINCH 
I'M READY 
JOHN'S OUT THE DOOR 
WHAT HEIGHT YOU WANT TO GO TO I'M GOING TO GO TO EIGHTY FEET 
WE ARE MOVING LEFT TO RIGHT STEADY STEADY 
WHEN WINCHING FROM A HEIGHT IT'S HARD TO KEEP THE LINE STABLE 
STEADY STEADY 
THE ONLY WAY TO STABILISE THE LINE IS TO DROP JOHN IN THE SEA 
JUST GOT TO DROP JOHN IN THE WATER TO STOP THE SWING STEADY STEADY 
O. K. THE SWING HAS STOPPED FORWARD FOUR 
FORWARD ONE FORWARD ONE 
STEADY CONTACT 
STEADY STEADY 
HOOK'S CLEAR MAINTAIN YOUR HEIGHT 
HIS FIRST PRIORITY IS TO GET PRESSURE ON THAT WOUND 
YOU'VE GOT THAT TIGHT HAVE YOU 
I'M GONNA HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR WOUND 
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS EASE THAT OFF 
CAN I OPEN THESE JEANS UP 
LET ME GET MY KNIFE OUT 
MIND YOUR HANDS OUT THE WAY 
STRAIGHT TO THE BONE LET'S GET THAT PAD UP THAT 
LET'S GET THIS ON IT 
YOU'RE DOING FINE 
THAT'S REALLY GOOD 
RIGHT 
THIS IS GOING TO HURT BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE YOUR LEGS SLIGHTLY THIS WAY 
ARE YOU O. K. NOT TOO BAD GIVING HIM ANY MORE GYP 
THIS MAY BE AGONY FOR THE CASUALTY BUT IT IS ESSENTIAL FAIRLY TIGHT AS I HOLD THE PAD ON 
THE BANDAGE IS ONLY A TEMPORARY MEASURE 
THEY MUST GET HIM TO HOSPITAL FOR IMMEDIATE SURGERY 
WHISKY BRAVO THE GUY IS OBVIOUSLY IN A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN SO WHAT IS IT 
IT IS A SLICE THROUGH HIS THIGH IS IT QUITE A BAD LACERATION IS IT 
VERY BAD WE'RE GONNA NEED THE STRETCHER DOWN HERE 
BECAUSE THE GUY'S LEG IS IN A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN 
SO IF YOU CAN GET THE STRETCHER DOWN 
HIS LEG MUST BE IMMOBILISED BUT GETTING HIM ON TO THE STRETCHER IS GOING TO BE TOUGH 
THAT WAS GOOD THAT WAS GOOD 
RIGHT GENTS 
COME HERE 
WE'RE GONNA PASS A STRETCHER DOWN RIGHT 
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE CHARGE OF IT YEP 
DON'T ATTACH IT TO ANYTHING JUST COIL IT UP JUST HERE YEAH 
RIGHT THE STRETCHER'S GONNA COME DOWN ON THAT YES 
GONNA DISCONNECT THE STRETCHER O. K. 
EVERYBODY NEEDS TO PULL TOGETHER TO GET THE CASUALTY SAFELY OUT OF HERE 
BACK IN PERRANPORTH LUKE IS PUMPING UP THE VOLUME ON HIS MESSAGE 
CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION IN THE WATER PLEASE A FEW BODY BOARDERS DRIFTING OUTSIDE THE AREA ONCE AGAIN 
IF YOU ARE SWIMMING BATHING OR BODY BOARDING 
YOUR SAFE AREA IS BETWEEN THE TWO RED AND YELLOW FLAGS 
YOUR CO OPERATION WAS MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU 
THE RIPS RIDING PRETTY STRONG SO WE TRY AND KEEP DOING P. A.'S FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY 
BUT IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE SANDY IS ON ANOTHER RESCUE 
COME RIGHT UP HOLD THE TOP ONE CLIMB ON CLIMB RIGHT UP RIGHT UP 
MAYBE I WAS A BIT STUPID IN TRYING TO GET ONE MORE WAVE 
BUT YES THERE WAS A SECURITY BLANKET I GUESS AND IT WAS A GOOD THING TO KNOW THEY WERE THERE 
THEY ARE ALWAYS THERE FOR THE LIFEGUARDS SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT 
YEAH JUST KIND OF PAING THEM AND WARNING THEM BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH 
WHERE WE HAD THE FLAGS ON THAT BANK YOU PROBABLY DON'T FEEL THE PULL AS MUCH 
BUT AS SOON AS THEY GO A COUPLE OF METRES TO THE RIGHT THEN THEY SUDDENLY FEEL IT 
THAT'S WHEN THEY START TO PANIC AND WE HAVE TO PICK THEM UP PRETTY QUICKLY 
WITH SO MANY HOLIDAYMAKERS IGNORING THE LIFEGUARDS SOMETHING HAS GOT TO GIVE 
THE CURRENTS ARE STILL THERE AND STILL VERY STRONG 
THERE'S ONE SOLUTION BUT IT'S DRASTIC 
MOVING EVERYONE AWAY FROM THE RIP CURRENT BUT IT'S HIGH SEASON AND THERE ARE TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE HERE 
IN THE SOLENT JOHN AND HIS HELPERS ARE READY TO PUT THE CASUALTY ON THE STRETCHER 
FORWARD EIGHT FORWARD SIX 
REDUCE SPEED FORWARD FIVE 
MOVING HIM WITHOUT CAUSING HIM MORE PAIN IS IMPOSSIBLE 
BUT THE BIGGEST RISK IS THAT THE WOUND WILL TEAR EVEN MORE 
STEADY CONTACT 
STEADY 
STEADY 
RIGHT I'M GONNA TURN THE STRETCHER ROUND 
I NEED SOME OF YOU TO HELP ME NOW 
O. K. LET'S DO THIS NICE AND GENTLY 
O. K. PUT BOTH ARMS AROUND MY NECK 
RIGHT LET ME LIFT YOU O. K. 
ALL RIGHT MATE WATCH HIS LEG 
KEEP HANGING ONTO ME RIGHT 
COME ON EDWARD I WANT YOUR HEAD BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS 
ANOTHER FOOT EDWARD COME ON EDWARD 
THAT'S IT YOU'RE NEARLY THERE 
THERE WE GO 
RIGHT GIVE ME THAT OTHER STRAP 
ED MUST BE SECURELY FASTENED THROUGH A FAILSAFE SYSTEM OF CLIPLOCKS 
RIGHT THAT THAT THAT 
READY FOR PICK UP FULLY FORWARD WHAT'S GONNA BE YOUR HEIGHT JOHN 
ABOUT EIGHTY FEET THAT'S YOUR HEIGHT GOOD THEN 
RIGHT TWO OF YOU FENDING OFF HERE IN CASE WE SNAG ON ANYTHING 
RIGHT YOU TWO FEND IT OFF THERE 
I'M GOING TO FEND THIS LEG AS BEST I CAN 
THREE STEADY ATTACH WINCHES ARE BOTH CLEAR 
SO WE'RE RIGHT OVER THE YACHT AT THE MOMENT OH HE'S GOT A SMILE ON HIS FACE THAT'S THE CASUALTY CLEAR 
O. K. WE'VE CLEARED THE YACHT SO WHEN YOU'RE HAPPY WE'LL DESCEND SLOWLY FORTY FEET ROGER HEIGHT'S GOOD 
APPROACHING THE AIRCRAFT 
OVER THE STEP 
POSITION THE STRETCHER AND BRING IT IN THE DOORWAY 
BRING THE STRETCHER SLOWLY ABOARD 
LOWER THE STRETCHER TO THE FLOOR 
STILL HAVE THE WINCH TO STOW 
DID YOU SAY YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN YEAH 
HERE WE GO MATE BREATHE 
YEAH JUST BREATHE IT IN 
NICE DEEP BREATHS 
SOLENT RESCUE WHISKY BRAVO WE HAVE THE CASUALTY ON BOARD NOW 
WHISKY BRAVO SOLENT THAT'S RECEIVED

THE TWO CASUALTIES HAVE ALREADY BEING TRYING TO KEEP THEIR HEADS ABOVE WATER FOR TWENTY MINUTES 
SOLENT COASTGUARD THIS IS THE LYMINGTON LIFEBOAT WE'RE LAUNCHED ON TASK 
IT MAY BE SUMMER BUT THE SOLENT IS STILL COLD ENOUGH TO KILL 
LYMINGTON LIFEBOAT LYMINGTON LIFEBOAT SOLENT COASTGUARD ROGER 
THE LIFEBOAT IS INFORMED THAT A PASSING YACHT HAS PULLED THE CASUALTIES OUT OF THE WATER

THE LIFEBOAT TRIES TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE YACHT 
SUNSAIL FORTY ONE THIS IS LYMINGTON LIFEBOAT OVER

NOW THEY CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THE YACHT WILL SPOT THEM 
BUT IT'S AN EMPTY HORIZON AHEAD 
SUNSAIL FORTY ONE SOLENT COASTGUARD CONFIRM WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN SEE THE LIFEBOAT YET OVER 
THEY HAVEN'T SEEN US YET 
IN PERRANPORTH THE LIFEGUARDS HAVE FINALLY BITTEN THE BULLET 
TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE ON THE MOVE 
GET OUT OF THE SEA AND WALK UP ON THE SAND 
CAN YOU MOVE TO SWIMMING OVER THERE BECAUSE THERE ARE RIP CURRENTS HERE 
THE RIPS ARE GOING TO BE A LOT STRONGER FOR EVERYONE'S SAFETY 
WE'RE TRYING TO GET EVERYONE OUT OF THE WATER 
THE LIFEGUARDS HAVE FOUND AN AREA WHERE THERE ARE NO RIP CURRENTS 
AT THIS STAGE NOW WE'VE MOVED TO THE OTHER SIDE NOW 
IT'S PRETTY SAFE FOR THE MOMENT 
WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO REASSESS LATER ON BUT NOW IT'S FINE 
WE'VE STILL GOT THE JET SKI IN THE WATER 
YEAH FOR NOW IT'S ALL RIGHT 
WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES 
PEACE HAS RETURNED TO PERRANPORTH FOR NOW 
OVER THERE 
IN THE SOLENT A BREAKTHROUGH 
SUNSAIL FORTY ONE WE HAVE VISUAL

THE CASUALTIES WERE TAKEN STRAIGHT TO HOSPITAL AND MADE A FULL RECOVERY 
THANKS TO THE QUICK RESPONSE OF THE LYMINGTON LIFEBOAT TEAM 
IT'S STILL PACKED AT PERRANPORTH AND THE LIFEGUARDS ARE KEEPING A SHARP EYE ON THE WATER 
BUT IT'S ON THE BEACH BEHIND THEM THAT SOMEBODY IS IN DISTRESS 
I WANT MY MUMMY

IT'S UP TO LIFEGUARD ANNABEL BARSCH TO REUNITE THIS LITTLE RUNAWAY WITH HER PARENTS 
SHE WON'T LET US ANYWHERE NEAR HER AND SHE'S VERY YOUNG 
SHE'S PROBABLY BEEN TOLD BY HER PARENTS NOT TO SPEAK TO STRANGERS 
BUT WE'RE ONLY TRYING TO HELP HER 
I'VE GOT TO KEEP AN EYE ON HER SHE'S RUNNING OFF AT THE MOMENT 
NEVER KNOWN A GIRL LIKE YOU BEFORE 
BUT TRYING TO ESCORT THIS LITTLE BUNDLE OF DETERMINATION BACK TO THE LIFEGUARD BASE IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE 
ON THE DORSET COAST ANOTHER FULL SCALE EMERGENCY IS IN OPERATION 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS A RAPID EVACUATION OVER 
TWO RNLI LIFEBOATS AND WHISKY BRAVO HAVE BEEN SCRAMBLED 
NO PULSE AT THIS TIME OVER NO PULSE THAT'S NOT GOOD 
A MAN ON A FISHING TRIP HAS COLLAPSED CLUTCHING HIS CHEST 
IF THERE'S NO PULSE ARE THEY TRYING TO RESUSCITATE HIM 
PORTLAND COASTGUARD YES WE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A LINK CALL WITH THE DOCTOR AT THE HOSPITAL 
BUT WITH NO DOCTOR ON THE BOAT EVERYONE'S RACING TO SAVE THE MAN'S LIFE 
IS THAT IT THAT LITTLE BLACK DOT AT THE SIDE OF CHESIL BEACH 
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT 
YEAH IT'S HARD UP AGAINST THE BEACH IT'S THERE 
THE CASUALTY HAS REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS BUT HE'S UNSTABLE 
AND NEEDS TO GET TO HOSPITAL BEFORE HE COLLAPSES AGAIN 
YOU ARE CLEAR TO WINCH

FORWARD ONE AND RIGHT 
AND STEADY ON THE DECK 
WHAT HAVE YOU HAD NOW

CAN YOU GET THAT FOR ME 
THE BOAT CREW HAVE TREATED THE CASUALTY FOR ANGINA 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT 
WE'LL GIVE HIM A PROPER CHECK IN THE AIRCRAFT 
PUT YOUR ARM THROUGH THERE 
HIS SYMPTOMS COULD MEAN HE'S HAD A HEART ATTACK 
THAT ONE THROUGH THERE JUST NICE AND GENTLY 
NICE AND EASY THAT'S IT WELL DONE 
HE LOOKS QUITE ELDERLY DOESN'T HE 
I'M GONNA PUT THESE STRAPS ROUND YOU 
WHEN THE CAB COMES BACK WE'LL BE GENTLY LIFTED OFF 
BRIAN SHOROCKS IS SIXTY SIX YEARS OLD AND IN HIS FRAGILE CONDITION A WINCH CAN ONLY ADD TO THE TRAUMA 
IF YOU'RE ABOUT READY FOR US 
BUT WHISKY BRAVO CAN GET BRIAN TO HOSPITAL MUCH FASTER THAN THE LIFEBOATS 
AT PERRANPORTH ANNABEL'S ATTEMPTS TO REUNITE THE LITTLE GIRL WITH HER MUM AREN'T GOING TO PLAN 
MY MUMMY MIGHT BE IN MY CAR 
THEY ARE A LONG WAY FROM THE BASE AND HEADING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION 
I WANT TO GO TO SEE THEM NOW 
THIS LITTLE GIRL'S RUNNING UP DROSKIN'S STEPS NOW 
SHE'S ADAMANT SHE'S NOT COMING BACK DOWN TO THE BEACH 
SHE WON'T LET ME GET HOLD OF HER 
ANNABEL IF YOU CAN KEEP AN EYE ON HER STAY WITH HER FOR THE MOMENT 
JUST TRY AND CALM THE SITUATION DOWN OVER 
ANTONIA CAN YOU LET ME TAKE YOU BACK TO THE LIFEGUARD HUT 
YOUR PARENTS WILL COME THERE TO LOOK FOR YOU 
I WANT TO SEE IF MY CAR'S STILL HERE 
IT'S BECOMING CLEAR THAT ANTONIA IS FRIGHTENED THAT HER PARENTS HAVE LEFT PERRANPORTH WITHOUT HER

O. K. I'LL LOOK AFTER YOU YOU CAN KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED IF YOU WANT 
STARTING WINCHING NOW FORWARD TWENTY AND DESCENDING 
AND STEADY STEADY CONTACT 
AND FORWARD AND TURN AND STEADY 
KEEP CLEAR OF THE DECK CLEAR THE DECK CLEAR THE DECK 
COMING UP SLOWLY 
AT THE DOOR AND IN THE CABIN 
HE IS GIVEN MEDICATION IMMEDIATELY TO EASE THE STRAIN ON HIS HEART 
HE IS JUST MINUTES FROM HOSPITAL 
I'M COLD 
I'M JUST LOOKING SEE IF YOU CAN SEE HER ACROSS THERE 
ANTONIA IS CLINGING TO ONE LAST HOPE THAT HER PARENTS HAVEN'T ABANDONED HER 
BUT SHE CAN'T SEE THEM 
IT'S ALL RIGHT THEY WON'T HAVE LEFT WITHOUT YOU ANTONIA 
THEY WILL THEY WON'T 
THEY ARE RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS BUT THEN THERE'S A BREAKTHROUGH 
HI THERE IT'S PERRANPORTH LIFEGUARDS HERE 
WE'VE JUST REPORTED A CHILD WE HAD FOUND WHICH SHE'S LOST HER PARENTS 
ANTONIA'S MUM HAS BEEN FOUND 
YOU WERE GOING TO SEND OUT A UNIT TO US 
WELL I THOUGHT SHE WAS PLAYING WITH HER BROTHER THEN HE COME BACK ON HIS OWN 
SO WE WENT DOWN THERE AND LOOKED FOR HER I WALKED ALL ALONG HERE 
IT'S JUST SO 
SHE KNOWS THE CAR'S UP THERE BECAUSE IT'S UP ON THAT HILL UP THERE 
SHE'S QUITE DETERMINED 
A LADY FOUND HER I FOLLOWED HER THE WHOLE WAY TO MAKE SURE SHE WAS ALL RIGHT 
MY MUMMY'S HERE 
I TOLD YOU NOT TO WANDER OFF DIDN'T I 
I SAID YOU'D FIND HER DIDN'T I 
YOU FOUND HER THANK YOU 
JUST TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE MOTHER AND THEY'RE BEING REUNITED BY THE STREAM 
WERE YOU SCARED 
YOU WEREN'T SCARED 
WE DID THINK WE'D LOST YOU 
YEAH WHERE'S OUR CAR MUMMY 
OUR CAR'S RIGHT UP THERE ON THAT HILL ISN'T IT 
I THOUGHT IT WAS ON THE ROOF 
DON'T BE SILLY 
AND IT'S NOT ONLY THE LIFEGUARDS WHO ARE ALWAYS THERE TO KEEP OUR COASTLINE SAFE 
IT'S QUITE A BAD LACERATION IS IT VERY BAD READY FOR WINCHING LINE 
FOR WINCHMAN JOHN SPENCER THE RESCUE OF THE MAN WITH THE GASHED LEG WAS ALL IN A DAY'S WORK 
IT WAS A VERY SERIOUS INJURY 
YOU'RE REALLY GOT TO GET ON WITH IT AND GET THE JOB DONE 
YOU TWO FEND IT OFF THERE I'LL TRY AND FEND THIS LEG THE BEST I CAN 
IT MAKES IT A LOT EASIER TO WORK AS A TEAM TO ACHIEVE THE TASK OF GETTING HIM SAFELY AIRLIFTED 
AND AS FOR ED HE'S HAVING INTENSIVE PHYSIOTHERAPY TO REGAIN THE FULL USE OF HIS LEG 
I'LL LOOK AFTER YOU CLEAR THE DECKS O. K. COMING UP 
AND BRIAN WAS EVENTUALLY DIAGNOSED AS HAVING SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK 
IF IT WASN'T FOR THEM WELL I MIGHT NOT BE HERE MIGHT I 
BUT HAPPILY HE MADE A FULL RECOVERY 
I'M EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO THEM 
BRILLIANT I DON'T THINK I'D BE BRAVE ENOUGH TO DO IT 
NEXT TIME ON SEASIDE RESCUE THE CREW OF WHISKY BRAVO RESCUES TWO DIVERS IN TROUBLE 
YOUR HEAD IS GONNA NEED STITCHES 
AND THE LIFEGUARDS HELP A GRANDMOTHER WITH A NASTY HEAD INJURY 
SHARON OH THAT FAT SHAZZA WHOA
