GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME AS 
ARSENAL'S HOPES APPEAR TO HAVE GONE 
UP IN SMOKE MANCHESTER UNITED CAN 
FINISH OFF THE GUNNERS' SEASON BUT 
ARSENE WENGER INSISTS THEY ARE NOT 
OUT OF IT YET 
WE GO TO MANCHESTER 
UNITED ON SUNDAY AND WE BELIEVE THE 
SEASON ISN'T OVER 
FIVE WINS WOULD 
GIVE CHELSEA TITLE BUT FIRST THEY 
HAVE TO GET PAST STEVE BRUCE AT 
WIGAN LIVERPOOL STAND IN THE WAY 
OF CHELSEA REACHING THE CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE FINAL BUT WILL BOARD RL IN 
FIGHTING RERAIL THE KD RED'S HOPES 
STRIKER MIKAEL FORSELL SAYS ARRESTS 
WON'T STOP HIS TEAM RANGERS ARE 
LOOKING FOR A REMARKABLE QUAND 
RUEPLE FOCUS ASKS DOES ANYONE WANT IT WAS VERY 
IT WAS VERY RELIEVED WHEN THE REFEREE BLEW THE 
WHISTLE 
WITH ME TWO MORE SPRING WHISTLE CHICKENS MARTIN KEOWN AND MARK 
LAWRENCE SON IT'S LAST CHANCE 
SALOON FOR ARSENE WENGER AS 
MANCHESTER UNITED ARE UP AGAINST 
ARSENAL THE GUNNERS ARE OUT OF THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE AND SIX POINTS 
BEHIND UNITED IN THE TITLE RACE SO 
IS IT ALL OVER FOR ARSENAL THIS 
SEASON IF SO WHY WE ASKED MARTIN 
WHO WON THREE LEAGUE TITLES AND 
THREE F. A. CUPS UNDER WENGER TO 
DISSECT WHERE IT HAS ALL GONE WRONG 
FOR HIS FORMER CLUB 
I WAS HIDING BEHIND THE SOFA 
REALLY WHAT AN INCREDIBLE GAME IT 
LOOKS LIKE IT WAS GOING TO BE 
LIVERPOOL'S NIGHT THEO WALCOTT 
COMES OFF THE BENCH AND GOES ON AN 
INCREDIBLE RUN GREAT GOAL FOR 
ARSENAL THEY WERE ALL SAYING 
WENGER IS GENIUS AND THIRTY SECONDS 
LATER IT BLOWS UP IN ARSENAL'S FACE 
THIS COULD TAKE 
LIVERPOOL THROUGH AND GERRARD 
SCORES LIVERPOOL IN SECONDS OF 
GOING OUT COULD BE GOING THROUGH 
THE OVERCELEBRATION THAT LITTLE 
BIT OF KNIFEITY ON THE NIGHT HAS 
REALLY COST THEM SIX WEEK AGO THEY 
WERE SIX POINTS CLEAR AND NOW THEY 
ARE SIX POINTS BEHIND MASSIVE 
REVERSAL WE CAN LOOK BACK TO OLD 
TRAFFORD 
WE LOOK BACK TO THE CARLING CUP 
WHEN THEY WENT OUT AS WELL BIG 
BLOWS FOR ARSENAL THE SQUAD HAS 
GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER WITH THE 
INJURIES THAT THIF HAD ROSICKY 
BEING OUT AND VAN YERSTY BEING OUT 
AND VAN PERCY BEING OUT AND 
SAGNOL BEING OUT A MAJOR LOSS FOR 
THEM PEOPLE HAD TO COME IN TO 
REPLACE THE LEVELS THEY HAVE BEEN 
LACKING IN MATURITY AND EXPERIENCE 
AND THAT HAS REALLY PUNISHED THEM 
DO YOU REGRET PERHAPS NOT MAKING A 
BIG SIGNING 
LET'S GO UNTIL THE END 
OF THE SEASON AND SEE WHAT WE 
ACHIEVE AND FOR YOU THE THE SEASON 
IS OVER FOR ME IT'S 
NOT OVER I'M I'M NOT GOING 
TO ASK ARSENE WENGER HOW TO DO HIS JOB HE WILL KNOW WHAT 
THEY ARE CAPABLE OF HE WILL HAVE 
PHONE WHAT HE WAS EXPECTING OF THEM 
AND IF HE DOESN'T FEEL THAT IS 
READY HE WILL ADD TO THAT THEY ARE 
IN A VERY VERY GOOD POSITION A 
MUCH STRONGER POSITION FINANCIALLY 
IN THE PAST SO THOSE DECISIONS 
WILL BE MADE IN THE SUMMER 
WHAT DO 
YOU SAY TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
QUESTIONING YOUR OWN POSITION IT'S IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM IT'S NOT MY WORRY 
YOU KNOW WHAT IS MY ONLY WORRY IS 
TO DO MY BEST EVERY DAY AND TO ACT 
AS IF I WOULD STAY MY WHOLE LIFE 
HERE THE AT THE CLUB 
PEOPLE ARE 
ASKING HIM ABOUT HIS FUTURE IS 
QUITE RIDICULOUS IF YOU LOOK AT 
THE CLUB NOW TO WHEN HE ARRIVED 
IT IS LIGHT YEARS AWAY THE 
STRUCTURE OF THE CLUB THE TRAINING 
GROUND AND THE STADIUM THE BRAND 
OF FUET BALL THAT THEY PLAY I 
THINK WENGER HAS BEEN A REAL 
PIONEER FOOTBALL IT MAY HAPPEN 
NEXT YEAR OR THE YEAR AFTER BUT I 
FEEL CERTAIN THE FANS WILL BE ABLE 
TO SHARE IN THAT SUCCESS AGAIN CAN CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THOSE SUPPORTERS AND 
PEOPLE IN THE IMMEDIATE SAYING SAYING ARSENAL'S SEASON IS OVER NOW 
NO 
MEDIA NO BECAUSE THE SEASON IS 
NOT OVER 
REALISTICALLY YOU CAN'T 
WIN THE TITLE CAN YOU 
WHY NOT IT IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED YOU ARE TOO FAR 
BEHIND 
WE ARE NOT IT DEPENDS ON BEHIND OUR RESULT ON SUNDAY DO WE WIN OR 
SUNDAY AND WE CAN WIN TITLE IT'S IT'S NOT COMPLETELY OVER THIS WEEKEND 
THEY GO TO OLD TRAFFORD THERE IS 
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PLAYERS TO 
GET BACK TO WINNING THREE POINTS 
FROM MANCHESTER UNITED THEY ARE 
GOING TO NEED PERSONALITY THE 
CHINS ARE ON THE FLOOR THEY ARE 
LOOKING FOR CHARACTER NOW TO 
BOUNCE BACK REALISH GOING TO 
MANCHESTER UNITED AND IT'S A 
DIFFICULT PLACE TO GO REAL 
CAULDRON ATMOSPHERE REAL CHAMPIONS 
AND WINNERS RELISH THAT SO THAT'S 
WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR AND THERE 
IS A FUTURE THERE FOR PLAYERS 
THEY HAVE TO GO AND PROVE IT 
MARTIN THAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT OF 
WHERE IT HAS GONE WRONG THIS SEASON 
LAWRO DO YOU AGREE 
YEAH L. THINK 
TO WIN THE PREMIERSHIP YOU HAVE TO 
HAVE YOUR BEST PLAYERS AVAILABLE 
FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE GAME 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY EVERY SINGLE 
GAME IT'S NICE TO HAVE THEM ON THE 
BENCH LIKE MANCHESTER UNITED WHO 
ARE OBVIOUSLY TOP THERE IS SUCH A 
FINE LINE BETWEEN WINNING A 
COMPETITION AND NOT SIX MINUTES 
AWAY FROM QUALIFYING FOR THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI FINAL THAT THAT IS ALL THAT WAS LEFT 
THEY ARE 
MISSED ROBIN VAN PERSIE AND EDUARDO 
AND YOU LOOK AT ARSENAL AND YOU SEE 
THEY ARE ADEBAYOR AND FABREGAS AND 
THEY SEEM TO BE WORKING ON EMPTY L. 
AM PRIZED SURPRISED HE DIDN'T 
PLAY FOR FOR AND GALLAS THE SPINE 
HAS TO BE REALLY STRONG 
WHY PLAY 
HIM AT RIGHT BACK 
I DON'T KNOW L. 
AM GUESSING THAT HE DOESN'T TRUST 
ABUYA AND HE PLAYED SENDEROS 
DECENT PLAYER THAT HE IS FOR THAT 
PLAYER AT THAT LEVEL HE MAKES A 
MISTAKE BUT THEY ARE THAT FAR AWAY 
AND FOR PEOPLE TO QUESTION HIS 
FUTURE AT THE CLUB IS ABSOLUTELY 
NUTS BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE FELLA 
THAT YOU WOULD LET TAKE OVER YOUR 
CLUB AND SAY GET ON WITH IT BUT 
YES WE UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU ARE 
TOP FOUR TEAMS YOU HAVE TO WIN A 
COMPETITION BUT THEY ARE VERY 
VERY CLOSE AND IT'S NOT BEYOND THE 
REALMS OF POSSIBILITY THAT GO TO 
OLD TRAFFORD AND WIN BUT I THINK 
THEY ARE RUNNING ON EMPTY AND 
WHATEVER YOU SAY I THINK THE 
GALLAS INCIDENT AT BIRMINGHAM AND 
HE IS SEVENTY YARDS AWAY SENT COMPLETELY 
THE WRONG SIGNAL AND EVEN IF THERE 
IS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN THAT AND 
THEIR FORM I THINK THE PLAYERS 
LOOK AT HIM AND THINK HE IS OR 
CAPTAIN WHAT IS HE DOING 
SOME OF 
THE FANS ARE A LITTLE UPSET THAT 
MONEY HASN'T BEEN SPENT BUT I 
DON'T THINK HE COULD HAVE FORESEEN 
THE INJURIES 
HE STARTED WITH A 
RELATIVELY SMALL SQUAD 
YEF BUT 
IT'S INEXPERIENCED THREE OR FOUR 
YEARS AGO WITH THE STADIUM THEY HAD 
TO GO THIS ROUTE AND BUYING YOUNG 
FOR THE FUTURE L. BELIEVE THEY 
WANTED TO STICK WITH THAT POLICY 
AT CHRISTMAS HE COULD SPENT AND HE 
DIDN'T THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT 
IN THE SUMMER AND I FEEL CERTAIN 
THEY WILL ADD TO THE SQUAD IN 
WHICH AREAS IT WILL BE DOWN TO 
WENGER 
THE OTHER THING IS FANS WENGER SAY WE SHOULD IS BOUGHT PLAYERS 
BUT THE THING IS IF THEY ARE NOT 
AS GOOD AS WHAT YOU GOT WHAT THE 
POINT JONATHON WOODGATE WAS TEN 
MILLION EUROS YOU LOOK AT HIM AND 
YOU THINK HE MIGHT MISS AS MANY 
GAMES AS EVERYBODY ELSE IT'S NOT 
WORTH DOG THEY HAVE A SMALLISH 
SQUAD HE WILL ALL ADD IN THE 
SUMMER BUT I REITERATE TEAR NOT 
FAR AWAY 
LIKE FOR LIKE THEY DON'T 
HAVE A REPLACEMENT FOR FABREGAS AND 
WHEN FLAM FLAM WENT OFF HAVE HAVE MANCHESTER UNITED HAVE A 
REPLACEMENT FOR RONALDO 
WHO HAS 
EXACTLY FABREGAS IS ABSOLUTELY 
OUTSTANDING YOU FIND THE FABREGASS 
OF THIS WORLD ONCE IN EVERY TEN 
YEARS THAT IS DIFFICULT AND 
ROSICKY HAS BEEN OUT ROSICKY WAS 
BOUGHT WITH PROVEN EXPERIENCE IN 
THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE THAT IS AN 
AREA OF THE TEAM IT'S MORE OF A 
GAMBLE TO GO WITH YOUNGSTERS IF 
THES GOING TO BUY AN INEXPERIENCED 
PLAYER WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT IN 
FRONT OF THE TEAM 
WHAT ABOUT THE 
FREE FLOWING ATTACKING FOOTBALL 
SHOULD WENGER REASSESS THAT NO ONE NO ONE EVER QUESTIONS IT WHEN THEY ARE 
WINNING ALL THE COMPETITIONS IT'S 
GREAT IT THEY HAD SURVIVED THE SIX 
MINUTES WE WOULD BE DOING THE TOP 
OF THE PROGRAMME ABOUT LIVERPOOL 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM AND WHERE 
IS RAFAEL BENITEZ GOING AND WHAT IS 
HAPPENING BEHIND THE SCENES IT'S 
THAT FINE LINE 
IT'S THE BALANCE 
IT IS MORE STEEL FROM ARSENAL THEY 
PLAY THE LOVELY ARTISTIC FOOTBALL 
AND ONCE THEY GET THE MIX RIGHT IT 
WILL COME FROM EXPERIENCE WITHOUT 
DOUBT 
LET'S HEAR FROM JONATHAN DOUBT PEARCE J. P. DO YOU BELIEVE THERE IS 
ANY LIFE LEFT IN ARSENAL'S SEASON 
I THINK IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT 
FOR THEM TO GO TO MANCHESTER UNITED 
AND WIN AND CHANGE THEIR CURRENT 
MIND SET AND MANCHESTER UNITED 
KNOW IF THEY CLEAR THIS HURDLE 
TOMORROW THEY ARE HOMING IN ON THE 
THE TITLE AGAIN AND RETAINING THE 
TITLE I ECHO THE SENTMENTS OF THE 
BOYS ESPECIALLY WHAT LAWRO HAS 
SAID ABOUT THE INCIDENT AT SAINT 
ANDREWS I WAS THERE AND THE 
BEHAVIOUR OF GALLAS I THINK SPOKE 
VOLUMES HIS BEHAVIOUR TOLD THE 
SUPPORTERS WE HAVE LOST THE TITLE 
TODAY IT WAS ALL ABOUT HIM AND NOT 
ABOUT GAEL CLICHY OR EDUARDO THE 
INJURY WAS A FACTOR AND ROBIN VAN 
PERSIE WHEN THEY WON THE DOUBLE 
THEY HAD SIX PLAYERS OUT FOR SIX 
WEEKS OR MORE THEY HAD STRONG 
SQUAD PLAYERS TO COME IN STRONGER 
THAN THEY HAVE AT THE MOMENT 
NICKLAS BENDTNER IS NOT THERE ONE 
OR TWO AREN'T THE FINISHED PRODUCT 
I THINK IT'S A HORRIBLE SITUATION 
AND THE MARGIN IS MINIMAL L. DO 
BELIEVE HE WILL STRENGTH IN THE 
SUMMER HE WON'T GO WILLY NILLY AND 
WHO CAN SAY HIS RECORD IN THE 
TRANSFER MARKET HAS BEEN 
MAGNIFICENT 
WHAT ABOUT HIS MAGNIFICENT EXPERIENCE THE PLAYERS ARE DOWN 
GALLAS MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE 
WEEK HE WILL HAVE A JOB TO TRY TO 
PICK THE PLAYERS UP FOR TOMORROW I I THINK HE WILL AND YOU HAVE TOUCHED 
ON A PROBLEM THERE WITH GALLAS AS 
THE CAPTAIN IS HE OF TONY ADAMS 
MATERIAL I COULD THE NOT SEE AN 
ARSENAL DEFENCE CONCEDING A PENALTY 
AS BADLY AS THAT THERE IS NO 
LEADERSHIP AT THE BACK NOT 
SUBSTANTIAL NO ONE THAT CUE REALLY 
WHOLEY RESPECT FABREGAS FOR ME 
WOULD BE A BETTER TEAM LEADER 
THANK YOU LOOKING AT THE BIGGER 
PICTURE WITH THE YOUNG SQUAD HE 
HAS THEY'VE DONE SURPRISINGLY 
WELL 
WELL THEY HAVE L. WAS AROUND WELL THAT TEAM SO OF TWO OR THREE YEARS 
AGO AND I REALISED THAT THE BOYS 
WERE COMING THROUGH A LOT OF 
PEOPLE SAID THEY WOULDN'T MAKE THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE YOU HAVE TO BE 
VERY CAREFUL LIKE J. P. TALKING ABOUT 
GALLAS WHEN THE RIVALS ARE GOING 
AFTER YOU YOU DON'T WANT TO SEND 
MESSAGES OUT THAT DON'T GO OUT THE 
RIGHT WAY AND THAT WAS A 
DISAPPOINTING MOMENT AND HE'S AN 
EMOTIONAL GUY EVERYONE WAS SAYING 
HE HAD BEEN AN INSPIRATION AND IT 
TOOK HIM TO ANOTHER LEVEL THERE 
STILL A CHANCE BUT NEVER WRITE 
THEM OFF MANCHESTER UNITED WILL 
KNOW THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE A 
VERY TOUGH GAME 
THEY HAVE DRAWN 
TOO MANY LATELY 
FOUR IN A ROW 
THEY HAVE NOT HAD A ENOUGH MATCH 
WINNERS IT IS THAT SMALL 
O. K. OF 
COURSE IF ARSENAL CAN GET ANYTHING 
OUT OF TOMORROW'S GAME AT OLD 
TRAFFORD CHELSEA WILL TAKE THE 
TITLE BY WINNING THE LAST FIVE 
THEY WOULD HAVE TO BEAT MANCHESTER 
UNITED AT STAMFORD BRIDGE THE 
FIRST HURDLE IS WIGAN ON MONDAY 
THEIR MANAGER IS A MANCHESTER 
UNITED LEGEND BUT STEVE BRUCE 
KNOWS WHERE HIS PRIORITIES LIE I I HAVE TO THINK OF THE CLUB THAT 
EMPLOYS ME NOW OF COURSE THAT IS 
THE ONLY THING THAT I HAVE GOT IN 
MY MIND NOW IS THAT WE STILL NEED 
A FEW POINTS TO GO TO TAKE CHELSEA 
ON WHEN THEY HAVEN'T BEEN BEATEN 
FOR FOUR YEARS IT'S A BIG ASK BUT 
IF YOU HAVE GOT ANYTHING ABOUT YOU 
YOU WANT TO PLAY IN THEM AND 
INVOLVED IN THEM MONDAY NIGHT THE 
TEAM GOING FOR THE THE TITLE 
PACKED WITH BIG PLAYERS FULL HOUSE 
FULL OF EXPECTATION BRILLIANT 
BRING IT ON LET'S HAVE A GO ARE ARE ARSENAL OUT OF IT 
YOU CAN'T SAY 
THAT BECAUSE IF THEY HAVE A GOOD 
WEEKEND IF THEY GET A RESULT 
AGAINST MANCHESTER AND CHELSEA AND 
MANCHESTER HAVE GOT TO GO HEAD TO 
HEAD SO I DON'T THINK YOU CAN RULE 
ANYBODY OUT JUST YET 
YOU HAVE IN 
THE THE IN THE GAME FOR A FEW YEARS 
AND A VERITABLE VETERAN 
IT SHOWS 
NOW 
ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT THE NOW FLAK WENGER HAS BEEN GETTING 
NOTHING SURPRISES US ANY MORE 
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE THE NATURE 
OF IT IF IT'S NOT ARSENE WENGER 
TEST AVRAM GRANT AND THERE IS SUCH 
A MEDIA ATTENTION TO EVERYTHING 
THAT IS INVOLVED WITH THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE THESE DAYS THAT WE ARE 
ALWAYS JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AWAY 
FROM CRISIS L. THINK YOU 
HAVE TO HAVE HAND IN THAT WHY SHOULD WE 
QUESTION ARSENE WENGER HE HAS 
PRODUCED A GREAT TEAM 
WHERE IS 
YOUR MONEY ON FOR THE TITLE STEVE 
OF COURSE EVERYONE KNOWS MY 
ALLEGIANCE AND WHO I PLAYED FOR 
FOUR TEN YEARS THEY ARE GOING TO 
TAKE ALL THE STOPPING L. THINK IT'S 
GREAT FOR THE GAME THAT THERE ARE 
TWO OR THREE STILL INVOLVED IT IS 
FASCINATING AND STILL IT COULD GO 
DOWN TO THE WIRE IT'S A CALL BUT 
I THINK I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF 
SIR ALEX IS PICKING UP HIS TENTH 
KNOW THEY ARE COMING TO US THE LAST 
GAME OF THE SEASON WHO WILL 
IT BE ALL OVER WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT 
THAT WOULD BE QUITE A GAME ON THE 
LAST DAY IT'S A POINT THAT HAS 
OFTEN BEEN LOST IF MANCHESTER 
UNITED DROP POINTS AND CHELSEA NEED 
TO WIN THE REST OF THEIR GAMES AND 
THEY WIN THE TITLE 
YEAH BUT 
CHELSEA ARE WINNING AT THE MOMENT 
BUT NOT PLAYING PARL WELL THEY ARE 
WINNING IN SPITE OF THE MANAGER 
NOT BECAUSE OF HIM BUT THE 
DIFFERENCE FOR ME AND ARSENAL IS 
THEY CAN PLAY POORLY BUT BECAUSE 
THEY ARE SO MENTALLY STRONG THEY 
GET THROUGH AND WIN THAT IS JUST 
THE DIFFERENCE BUT I CAN'T 
HONESTLY SEE ARSENAL WINNING AT OLD 
TRAFFORD TOMORROW L. CAN SEE THEM 
MAYBE GETTING A POINT BUT NOT 
WINNING 
CAN YOU SEE THEM PICK ENOUGH POINTS 
AND PIPPING UNITED TO THE POST 
CHELSEA DO HAVE REAL CHANCE 
QUIETLY THEY HAVE GONE ABOUT THEIR 
WORK YES THEIR FORM HAS BEEN 
INDIFFERENT BUT THAT WON'T BOTHER 
THEM THEY HAVE SEEN THE PLAYERS 
SEEM TO BOSS IT LITTLE BIT YOU 
WONDER WHO IS IN CHARGE AT TIMES 
BUT WIGAN EVERTON THOSE TWO AWAY 
GAMES IF THEY CAN WIN THEY CAN GO 
AHEAD OF MANCHESTER UNITED 
THAT WILL GIVE THEM A PSYCHOLOGICAL 
TO SEE THEIR NAME AT THE TOP OF THE 
TABLE 
AN INTERESTING COMMENT FROM TABLE PETER KENYON WHICH WAS ABOUT 
CHELSEA AND THEIR STYLE OR LACK OF 
THAT WILL TELL YOU MORE ABOUT WHAT 
HAPPENS TO THEIR MANAGER THAN 
ANYTHING ELSE BUT I DON'T THINK 
THE FOOTBALL IS WHERE THEY WANT TO 
BE 
IF YOU SPENT HALF A MILLION YOU BE WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND YOU ALSO 
WANT TURN UP AND GO ENTERTAIN ME 
CHELSEA ARE IN THE MIX FOR EUROPEAN 
SILVERWARE BENITEZ'S LIVERPOOL RAFA 
REVELS IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
AGAINST CHELSEA BUT WHEN IT COMES 
TO THE PREMIER LEAGUE IT'S A 
DIFFERENT STORY IN FACT IN EIGHT 
PREMIER LEAGUE MEETINGS THE REDS 
HAVE MANAGED JUST ONE WIN IN 
JANUARY LAST YEAR 
AWAY BY ESSIEN IT FALLS FOR 
PENNATNT CHELSEA WON FIVE OF THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE GAMES ONE MAN HAS 
GRABBED THE WINNER TWICE 
IT'S JOE COLE WITH THE GOAL WHEN WHEN IT COMES TO CUP COMPETITION RAFA 
IS IN A DIFFERENT LEAGUE HIS 
EUROPEAN EXPLOITS ARE LEGENDARY IN 
HIS SIX MEETINGS CHELSEA HAVE BEEN 
SPECIAL JUST ONCE WHILE IN THE 
OTHER CUP CHELSEA GAVE LIVERPOOL 
THE PLUS IN THE TWO THOUSAND SIX CITY FINAL 
IT'S RIISE 
RIISE REPEATED THE RESULT IN THE 
COMMUNITY TALK ABOUT 
FAMILIARITY BREEDING CONTEMPT IT'S 
LIVERPOOL V.'S CHELSEA AGAIN IN THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE THE FACT THAT 
CHELSEA ARE AT HOME IN THE SECOND 
LEG GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE I I THINK IT MIGHT DO L. THINK 
LIVERPOOL HAD THE BENEFIT OF TWO 
BIG DECISIONS AGAINST ARSENAL 
WHICH CHELSEA WILL BE HOPING FOR 
BOTH GAMES ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO CALL 
REALLY THEY WON'T BE ANYTHING LIKE 
THE GAME ON TUESDAY NIGHT THAT IS 
FOR CERTAIN L. THINK IT WILL BE 
VERY MUCH A DOG EAT DOG NOT GREAT 
AFFAIRS IT'S A REAL FIFTY FIFTY T. H. S. THAT L. 
KNOW THE SECOND LEG IS AT STAMFORD 
BRIDGE L. DON'T THINK IT'S THE CALL 
DROWN OF ON FIELD L. SEE LIVERPOOL 
COMING THROUGH THEY HAVEN'T DONE 
IT AT ALL IN THIS COMPETITION I 
THINK LIVERPOOL WILL TAKE TO 
ANOTHER LEVEL L. HAVE BEEN AT A FEW 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE GAMES THIS SEASON 
YOU KNOW YOU ARE IN TROUBLE WHEN 
YOU GIVE ALL THE FANS A FLAG TO 
WAVE DO ME A FAVOUR WHAT COLOUR 
TO CHELSEA PLAY IN OH BLUE 
TOM HICKS STILL SQUABBLING AT 
LIVERPOOL HE HAS DEMANDED RICK 
PARRY'S RESIGNATION 
THAT IS NOT GOING HAPPEN BECAUSE 
HE IS GOING TO VOTE FOR HIMSELF 
TURKEYS FOR CHRISTMAS COMES TO MIND 
IT'S A AS FAR AS ISN'T IT 
IT IS THEY SAY IT'S ABOUT AN OLD 
MARRIED COUPLE ABOUT TO SPLIT UP 
AND DIVORCED SORT OUT THE MONEY 
ONE YOU OF BUY THE OTHER OUT THEN 
WE CAN GO FORWARD UNTIL THAT 
HAPPEN YOU WONDER ABOUT BENITEZ'S 
TRANSFER TARGET YOU WONDER WHO HE 
GOES FOR 
IT'S A BIG CLUB IT'S 
EMBARRASSING 
TALKING OF JOB EMBARRASSING SECURITY YOU ALLUDED TO THE POINT 
ABOUT VAM VAM AND THE BACKING PETER 
KENYON DO YOU EXPECT HIM TO BE AT 
THE CLUB NEXT SEASON 
NO I DON'T 
THINK SO 
YOU COULD SEE HIM WINNING 
THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
SURELY THAT 
WILL SECURE HIS JOB FOR ANOTHER 
YEAR AT LEAST 
I THINK CHELSEA HAVE BECOME LIKE 
REAL MADRID AND BARCELONA WITH 
THEIR MANAGERS CAN YOU WIN ANY 
COMPETITION WHATSOEVER AND SCUDLY 
YOUR LIFE SPAN IS OVER THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH HERE IS SOME MORRIS 
MONEY OFF INTO THE SUNSET WE ARE 
BRINGING X. IN THAT IS WHO WILL 
HAPPEN IN CHELSEA 
WE HAVE BARCELONA TAKING ON 
MANCHESTER UNITED WHO DO YOU FANCY 
IN THAT ONE 
BARCELONA AGAIN THEY 
HAVE HAD PLAYERS OUT IF YOU CAN 
GET THOSE TWO BACK 
MESSI IS BACK 
HENRY HAS BEEN INDIFFERENT WITH HIS 
FORM FOR THE MOMENT IT LOOKS LIKE 
MANCHESTER UNITED WILL LOOK 
COMFORTABLE IN THAT GAME YOU 
WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT TWO OR 
THREE SEASONS AGO 
TALKING OF 
BARCELONA RONALDINHO COULD BE ON 
HIS WAY TO A. C. MILAN ACCORDING TO 
REPORTS IN ITSLY SURPRISED BY THAT 
HE IS OUT OF THERE IS HE NOT 
PLAYING THE REST OF THE SEASON HE 
HAS DONE HIS TIME THERE HE WANTS 
TO GO ON THIS ONE OF THE 
MAJOR PLAYERS OF HIS ERA SOMETHING 
MAJOR HAS GONE ON FOR HIM TO HAVE 
TO LEAVE 
LET'S GET J. P.'S THOUGHTS 
ON THE LIVERPOOL CHELSEA TIE IT'S 
TOO CLOSE TO CALL SAYS LAWRENSON 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I WOULDN'T BE 
SURPRISED IF THEY SCORE THAT COULD 
BE DECISIVE L. THINK THEY HAVE ONE 
OR TWO MORE GAME BREAKERS 
LIVERPOOL HAVE THE OUTSTANDING 
FERNANDO TORRES IT'S DIFFICULT TO 
CALL AS FOR RAFA'S POSITION IT IS 
SAFE IT'S A CRYING SHAME WHAT IS 
GOING ON L. DON'T THINK THAT 
GILLETTE AND HICKS UNDERSTAND THAT 
THE LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB IS 
UNIQUE IN MANY WAYS IT REPRESENTS 
THE CITY IT'S PEOPLE HUGELY 
IMPORTANT TO THEM IT'S A LIVING 
THING NOT JUST A STOCK OR A SHARE 
THE QUICKER THEY DECIDE WHAT MONEY 
THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE CAN THEY BE 
GREEDY IN A TERRIBLE MONEY MARKET 
OR CAN THEY BE REASONABLE AND LET 
DIC COME BACK N. I AM SURE THE FANS 
WOULD PREFER THAT AS FAR AS AVRAM 
GRANT'S POSITION IT WOULDN'T 
SURPRISE ME IF HE WAS MOVED UP 
JUDGE STAIR AND GUUS HIDDINK COMES 
IN HE HAS TO WIN THE CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE THREE FOUR TO ZERO IN THE FINAL TO 
STAY IN THE JOB IT'S A SHAME HE 
IS GOOD MAN BUT PLAYERS HAVE AN 
ENORMOUS AMOUNT TO SAY AT CHELSEA 
IT'S AN INTERESTING SITUATION DO 
THEY WIN IT FOR THEMSELVES OR THE 
MANGSNER 
MANAGER L. HEAR YOU ARE MANGSNER DOING THE MARATHON 
I WILL BE A 
BLUR ON THE SCREEN ONE AM THAT FAST 
I AM RAISING MONEY IN MEMORY OF MY 
NIECE WHO DIED AGED EIGHT MONTHS 
LAST YEAR PLEASE SUPPORT US ON 
THAT THE LILY FOUNDATION YOU YOU MIGHT CATCH A GLIMPSE OF J. P. 
POUNDING THE STREETS OF LONDON IT 
SHOULD BE QUITE A SIGHT LIVER 
COVERAGE OF THE LONDON MARATHON 
TOMORROW RIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK 
AT THE WEEKEND'S FIXTURES IN THE 
BARCLAYS PREMIER LEAGUE SOME KEY 
GAMES AT THE BOTTOM NOT LEAST FOR 
BIRMINGHAM MORE ON THEM SHORTLY 
ELSEWHERE BOLTON NEED TO BEAT WEST 
HAM TO GIVE THEMSELVES A CHANCE OF 
STAYING UP 
IVAN GASKILL HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO 
MIKAEL FORRSELL AND MANAGER ALEX 
MCLEISH 
I AM SURE IT'S SOMETHING MCLEISH THAT KAREN AND DAVID WILL SORT OUT 
I HAVE NEVER SPOKEN TO THE PLAYERS 
ABOUT IT IT'S NOT BEEN THAT 
UNUSUAL OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO 
IT SEEMS TO BE PART OF FOOTBALL 
LIFE AT THE MOMENT IT SEEMS TO BE 
IN VOGUE LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY WE 
SEE IT AGAIN I AM CONFIDENT THAT 
KAREN AND DAVID WILL BE O. K. OUT OF 
THIS THE ARRESTS OF DAVID SULLIVAN 
AND KAREN BRADY RELATE TO AN 
ONGOING INVESTIGATION INTO FOOTBALL 
THOUGH THE CLUB DENIES ANY WRONG 
DOING HAUNTED BY RELEGATION FEARS 
THE TIMING IS NOT IDEAL BUT 
BIRMINGHAM INSIST THEY WON'T TAKE 
THEIR EYE OFF THE BALL FOR THE 
MOMENT WE ARE JUST CONCENTRATING ON 
FOOTBALL 
AND THAT SATURDAY GAME AGAINST 
SEVER EVERTON WE NOT TALK NOT 
TALKINGING ABOUT THAT 
IT'S NO A 
WORRY NO 
SO TIME TO CONCENTRATE WORRY NO ON THE NEXT GAME THE FIRST OF FIVE 
THAT WILL DETERMINE BIRMINGHAM'S 
IMMEDIATE PREMIER LEAGUE FUTURE 
THOUGH WITH FOURTH SPOT UP FOR 
GRABS EVERTON ARE UNLIKELY TO GO 
EASY 
I THINK THE SEASON HAS BEEN A EASY BIT SPECIAL FOR US WE HAVE BEEN 
ACTUALLY PLAYING BETTER AGAINST THE 
BIGGER TEAMS 
HERE IS MIKAEL 
FORRSELL IT'S A HAT TRICK WE WE BELIEVE THAT THERE COULD BE THREE 
POINTS FOR US SPECIALLY IF WE KNOW 
THAT IF WE GET THREE POINTS THAT 
TAKE US A MASSIVE STEP TOWARDS 
SAFETY SO IT'S A BIG EVEN THOUGH 
I UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE A BIG THING 
TO PLAY FOR SO HAVE WE 
YOU SEEM 
TO HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME 
BUT I AM RIGHT IN SAYING YOU ARE 
JUST TWENTY SEVEN YOU ARE A SPRING CHICKEN 
THE BEST IS YET TO COME HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY I CAN AGE WISE IN FOOTBALL TWENTY SEVEN TO 
THIRTY IS THE PEAK AGE THAT IS WHAT I 
AM WORKING FOR OBVIOUSLY NOW I AM 
PLAYING GAMES IN THE LAST FEW 
MONTHS AND THE MANAGER HAS HAD 
TRUST IN ME AND THAT HELPS 
HOPEFULLY MY AIM IS TO SCORE AS 
MANY GOALS AS I CAN TOWARDS THE END 
OF THE SEASON INDIVIDUALLY AND TO 
HELP THE TEAM TO STAY UP AND TO 
BUILD FOR THE NEXT SEASON 
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE RELEGATED 
HAVE YOU HAD THAT BEFORE BACK INTO 
MIKAEL FORRSELL IT'S THE 
OPPORTUNITY EMILE HESKEY GIVEN 
AGAIN CAN YOU BELIEVE IT SHAI 
GIVEN MAY HAVE REL GETED BURM CITY 
WHAT HAS IT BEEN LIKE 
TO BE HONEST 
EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN A DIFFICULT 
SEASON WE KNEW AT THE GIING OF THE 
SEASON IT IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT 
IF YOU COMPARE THIS TEAM AND THE 
FEELING WE HAVE HAD TO THE TEAM WE 
HAD TWO YEARS AGO THAT WENT DOWN 
IT'S BEEN DIFFERENT WE HAVE HAD A 
VERY POSITIVE ATMOSPHERE A VERY 
POSITIVE MOOD AND THAT MOOD THE 
WHOLE TEAM WILL KEEP US UP GUY GUY MOWBARY IS AT SAINT ANDREWS DO WE 
KNOW MORE ABOUT THE AIR RESTS HELD 
EARLIER IN THE WEEK 
JUST THAT THEY 
WERE HELD FOR FIVE HOURS FOR 
QUESTIONING AND THAT DAVID 
O'SULLIVAN IS FURIOUS ABOUT IT THE 
CLUB DENY ANY WRONGDOING DAVID 
SULLIVAN WAS SAYING THAT BASICALLY 
THE WORD ARREST IS A LITTLE BIT OWE 
PHONESIVE AS WELL THEY WENT IN FOR 
QUESTIONING THEY HAVE SAID WHAT 
THEY KNOW ABOUT IT IT'S A TAX AND 
NATIONAL INSURANCE YUSH THAT SEEMS 
TO BE AT THE ISSUE THAT SEEMS TO 
BE THE AT THE ROOT OF IT ALL AND 
THIS IS THE LAST THING THEY NEED 
RIGHT NOW AS REGARD THE PLAYERS I 
DON'T THINK IT WILL EFFECT THEM 
THERE IS AN EVEN BIGGER SOAP OPERA 
GOING ON AT LIVERPOOL 
I BET YOU 
ARE REGRETTING NOT BRINGING A 
BROLLY 
IT'S NOT TOO BAD SUNSHINE BROLLY AND SHOWERS IF THEY WIN WE MIGHT 
HAVE A RAIN BOW AND A POT OF GOLD 
WITH THEM STAYING IN THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE 
DO YOU RECKON JAMES LEAGUE MCFADDEN MIGHT BE BACK TO FACE HIS 
FORMER CLUB 
IT'S AN OUTSIDE CHANCE 
HE HAS NOT DONE A LOT OF TRAINING 
THEY HAVE BEEN HOLDING HIM BACK 
FOUR GAMES TO GO AFTER THIS IF 
THEY RUSH HIM BACK TODAY THEY 
MIGHT REGRET IT HE WILL BE 
CHAMPING AT THE BIT TO PLAY AGAINST 
EVERTON 
WE HEARD FROM MIKAEL EVERTON FORRSELL EARLIER HIS GOALS ARE 
GOING TO BE CRUCIAL IF BIRMINGHAM 
ARE GOING TO STAY UP 
THEY ARE HE 
SHOWED SIGNS IN MARCH IT'S KEY TO 
THAT MCLEISH HAS A GOOD ATMOSPHERE 
GOING IN THE TEAM THEY WILL NEED 
TO GET MORE POINTS I SEE BOLTON 
WINNING AT HOME TODAY BIRMINGHAM 
WILL GO OUT ABOUT THEIR JOB 
PROFESSIONALLY THEY HAVE DONE WELL 
RECENTLY 
DO YOU SEE THE PLUS RECENTLY STAYING UP 
I THINK THAT BOLTON ARE 
GOING DOWN IN ALL HONESTY THE 
GREAT WORRY ABOUT MCLEISH WITH HIS 
TEAM HE HAD A RELATIVELY YOUNG 
TEAM I THINK THEY HAVE ENOUGH TO 
STAY UP BECAUSE BOLTON HAVEN'T GOT 
ENOUGH TO STAY UP 
YOU THINK FULHAM 
AND BOLTON WILL BE THERE COME THE 
END OF THE SEASON AS THE 
RELEGATION BATTLE HOTSS UP SCORE 
WILL HAVE THE LATEST ON THE KEY 
GAMES WE WILL HAVE PREMIER LEAGUE 
HIGHLIGHTS FROM TEN THIRTY P. M. 
NOW EARLIER WE HEARD FROM THE 
BIRMINGHAM CAMP ON THEIR NEED FOR A 
WIN OVER EVERTON TODAY FOR THE 
TOFFEES VICTORY AT SAINT ANDREWS WILL 
PUT THEM LEVEL ON POINTS WITH 
LIVERPOOL IN FOURTH PLACE EVERTON 
REMAIN IN THE HUNT FOR CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE QUALIFICATION THANKS TO ONE 
OF THE MEANEST DEFENCES IN THE TOP 
FLIGHT WITH GOALKEEPER TIM HOWARD 
BOASTING FOURTEEN CLEAN SHEETS SO FAR 
THIS SEE SON TIM HAS BEEN SPEAKING 
TO HIM 
FOR EVERTON FANS TO FINISH ABOVE 
LIVERPOOL WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH ON 
ITS OWN FOR TIM HOWARD TO BEAT 
THEIR RIVALS TO A CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
SPOT WOULD BE SOMETHING ELSE 
WE ARE FEELING GOOD LAST YEAR WE 
FINISHED IN THE UEFA CUP SPOT AND 
IT REALLY WASN'T A BATTLE FOR 
FOURTH SO THIS YEAR THE FACT THAT 
IT'S GOING SEEMINGLY DOWN TO THE 
WIRE WE ARE ALL EXCITED FOR IT 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT EXTRA MOTIVATION 
WE NEED HOW FRUSTRATED ARE YOU 
AFTER THE LATEST MERSEYSIDE DERBY 
RESULT AT ANFIELD 
WE ARE 
FRUSTRATED BASED ON THE FACT WE 
PLAYED THEM CLOSE TWO TO ONE AND ONE TO ZERO WE 
WOULD ADMIT THE GAME AT ANFIELD 
DIDN'T GO OUR WAY WE ARE DOING OUR 
BEST AT THE MOMENT TO MAKE SURE WE 
GET OR AT LEAST TRY AND GET FOURTH 
PLACE OUR DESTINY IS NOT IN OUR 
OWN HANDS NOW WE NEED TO DO OUR 
BUSINESS AND HOPE FOR A SLIP UP 
HOWARD HAS PLAYED IN THE CHAMPIONS 
LEAGUE WITH MANCHESTER UNITED A 
PERIOD IN HIS LIFE WHICH TAUGHT HIM 
SO MUCH 
I SEE IT AS THE BEST THING 
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO MY CAREER IT 
REALLY WAS A SPRINGBOARD FOR ME L. 
LEARNT SO MANY THINGS FROM THE 
GAMES AND THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE 
IMPORTANCE OF THE GAMES SOME 
LEGENDARY PLAYERS I PLAYED WITH IT 
HAD SUCH AN EFFECT ON ME L. L. HAVE 
TAKEN SO MANY POSITIVE THINGS OUT 
OF PLAYING THEM I DENT THINK I 
WOULD BE CLOSE TO THEM AT EVERTON 
AND AT AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL IF I 
HAVEN'T HAD THAT EXPERIENCE A FEW 
OF BOYFRIENDSS IN OUR DRESSINGROOM 
HAVE HAD A FEW OF OUR PLAYERS IN 
THE DRESSINGROOM HAVE HAD THAT 
OPPORTUNITY WE WOULD LOVE THAT 
BUT TO BE IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
IS THE PINNACLE 
HOW MUCH ARE YOU 
MISSING TIM CAHILL 
H. E. IS BIG LOSS FOR US AT ANY 
POINT IN THE SEASON BUT 
PARTICULARLY NOW THE THING ABOUT 
TIM IS HE IS INFECT SHUS AROUND THE 
TRAINING ROOM HE MIXS IT UP WITH 
EVERYONE HE GETS HIS GOALS AND HE 
IS HAVING GOOD TYPE IS HE ONE 
PLAIFTERS IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
BEGINING OF THE PLAYERS IF YOU 
LOOK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON 
WILL WE STRUGGLE HE IS THE ONE 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR GAMES 
DO YOU LOOK AND THINK WE SHOULD 
WIN THAT ONE YOU MIGHT SLIP UP 
THERE 
YOU ME AND EVERYONE ELSE THERE PROBABLY DOES THAT L. SAY TO ALL OF 
THE PEOPLE BACK HOME WHO DON'T KNOW 
WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE IN AMERICA 
THEY SAY YOU PLAY MANCHESTER UNITED 
THAT WILL BE A TOUGH ONE THEN THEY 
SAY YOU ARE GOING TO A RELEGATION 
TEAM YOU WILL WIN THAT IT DOESN'T 
WORK LIKE THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO 
GO TO FULHAM AND WIN BASED ON THE 
FORM THEY BEAT US WHEN SATURDAY 
COMES AT THREE HUNDRED P. M. AND THE GAME KICKS 
OFF IT NEVER WORKS LIKE THAT L. 
CAN GARN TEE YOU THE LAST KICK OF 
THE BALL AT THE END OF THE SEASON 
NEITHER YOU OR I WILL BE RIGHT 
AWAY TO BIRMINGHAM IS A DIFFICULT 
GAME CHELSEA AT HOME IN BETWEEN 
WE DON'T KNOW WE UP FOR IT WE 
KNOW THE TASK AHEAD 
TIM HOWARD HE 
CERTAINLY PLAYED HIS PART AT YOUR 
FORMER CLUB 
YOU DOESN'T GET MANY 
MENTIONS HE GOES ABOUT HIS JOB HE 
WENT TO MANCHESTER UNITED AND IT 
DIDN'T WORK OUT FOR HIM HE BOUNCED 
BACK 
RECENTLY EVERTON'S FORM HAS BACK DIPPED A LITTLE BIT ONE WIN FROM 
FOUR THIS TIME OF THE SEASON THEY 
PLAYED THIRTEEN GAMES MORE THIS YEAR THAN 
THEY DID LAST YEAR L. THINK THEY 
HAVE RUN OUT OF STEAM A LITTLE BIT 
THEY WILL BE PREPARING FOR THIS 
WEEKEND'S GAME TIM CAHILL IS OUT 
JOHNSON HAS BEEN OUT AS WELL THEY 
HAVE HAD AN OUTSTANDING SEASON 
THEY NEED TO FINISH IT OFF CAN 
THEY MAKE THAT NEXT STEP THEY HAVE 
AN OUTSTANDING MANAGER IF YOU LOOK 
AT THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS 
THEY HAVE ALL BEEN SUCCESSFUL 
CAHILL ARTETA LESS LESS AND 
NEVILLE ALL OF THOSE PLAYERS HAVE 
DONE BETTER ONE OR TWO CAN PLAY IN 
DIFFERENT POSITIONS THEY HAVEN'T 
GOT THE BIGGEST OF SQUADS BUT HE IS 
THE BEST IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE FOR 
ME 
HE SPENT IT VEE WISELY CAN HE ME CATCH LIVERPOOL 
NO 
THE GULF IS TOO BIG THESE GUYS NO HAVE BEEN IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
FOR SUCH A LONG TIME THE POOL OF 
MONEY THEY HAVE ABOVE AND BEYOND 
EVERTON THEY ARE MAKING A GOOD 
FIST OF IT 
MEANWHILE PORTSMOUTH 
ARE FIGHTING FOR EUROPEAN FOOTBALL 
ON TWO FRONTS THEIR IMPRESSIVE 
LEAGUE SEASON CONTINUED ON TUESDAY 
NIGHT AGAINST WEST HAM 
THREE DAYS EARLIER POMPEY BOOKED 
THEIR PLACE IN THE F. A. CUP FINAL 
BEATING WEST BROM OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP AT WEMBLEY FORMER 
BAGGY KANU SCORED THERE WAS A 
SUGGESTION PIGS OF HAND BALL BY 
BAROS IN THE BUILD UP 
ROBERT CORAN NEARLY SQUARED THINGS 
UP THE WOODWORK HELPED SEE 
PORTSMOUTH THROUGH TO THEIR FIRST 
F. A. CUP IN SIXTY NINE YEARS THEY WILL 
FACE CARDIFF CITY UNDER THE ARCH 
WHO COULD BECOME THE LOWEST RANKED 
SIDE TO WIN THE F. A. CUP IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
IT REKINDLES MEMORY WAS THE 
FAVOURITE CUP WIN IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN ON THE 
TERRACE IS NINETY SEVEN YEAR OLD DAVID MORGAN 
HEY RELIVING THAT SPECIAL DAY HE 
HAS BEEN RELIVING THAT SPECIAL DAY 
THIS IS A TALE OF A TEAM AND A FAN 
THE FAN WAS A TEENAGE SUPPORTER AT 
ANYONEIAN PARK WHO FOLLOWED CARDIFF 
CITY ON THEIR EPIC JOURNEY TO 
WEMBLEY EIGHTY ONE YEARS AGO TOGETHER 
CARDIFF CITY AND DAVID MORGAN WERE 
PART OF AN HISTORIC CUP FINAL THE 
OPPOSITION WERE ARSENAL LLOYD 
GEORGE WAS THERE AND OF COURSE 
THERE WAS ROYALTY ON AN 
UNFORGETTABLE DAY FOR A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD 
IT'S QUITE A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE FOR 
ME I ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE OF IT 
BASICALLY WONDERFUL ATMOSPHERE 
THE F. A. CUP IS FAR MORE EXCITING 
THAN ANY ORDINARY LEAGUE MATCH 
EVEN IF YOU REFER TO THE 
PREMIERSHIP 
NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN SET A BENCH MARK PREMIERSHIP WEMBLEY ITSELF ONLY FOUR YEARS OLD 
PUT ON A FIRST OF FIRSTS ABIDE 
WITH ME MADE IT'S DEBUT AND B. B. C. 
RADIO COVERED ITS FIRST CUP FINAL 
AND THE PRIME MINISTER WAS A 
WELSHMAN AND CARDIFF'S MASCOT WAS A 
CAT FOR SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES THE GAME WAS 
NERVEY AND GOALLESS AND THEN CAME A 
MOMENT FOR DAN LEWIS ARSENAL'S 
GOALKEEPER 
IT WAS A VERY GOOD SHOT GOALKEEPER AND ALTHOUGH THE GOALKEEPER WENT 
DOWN THE GOALKEEPER SCRAMBLED THE 
BALL AND TURNED AROUND TO TRY AND 
GRAB IT AND IT WENT INTO THE NET TO 
MY GREAT DELIGHT EVEN LLOYD GEORGE 
WAS PLEASED IT'S THE LONGEST FIFTEEN 
MINUTES OF MY LIFE L. WAS VERY 
RELIEVED WHEN FINALLY THE REFEREE 
BLEW THE WHISTLE 
SO THE CUP WAS 
CARRIED OUT OF ENGLAND FOR THE 
FIRST AND SO FAR ONLY TIME WHAT OF 
THE LUCKY MASCOT TRICKSY THE CAT 
HE IS HONOURED STILL THAT IS WHY 
CARDIFF HAVE WORN BLACK SHI'ITES 
THROUGHOUT THIS RUN HAVING WAITED 
EIGHTY ONE YEARS THE BLUEBIRDS ARE HAPPY 
IN BLACK AND NO ONE HAPPIER THAN 
NINETY EIGHT YEAR OLD DAVID MORGAN WHO GIVES 
NEW MEANING TO THE TERM LIFE LONG 
SUPPORTER DAVID WAS AT WEMBLEY FOR 
THE SEMI FINAL JOE LEDLEY SCORED 
WITH EIGHTY ONE MINUTES LEFT THEY HELD ON 
AND NOW EIGHTY ONE YEARS AFTER A TEENAGER'S 
FIRST TRIP TO THE OLD WEMBLEY 
DAVID MORGAN WILL BE BACK AT THE 
NEW WEMBLEY TO SEE CARDIFF TAKE ON 
PORTSMOUTH BUT IT HAS BEEN A LONG 
WAIT 
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE WAIT TO WAIT UNTIL I WAS NINETY SEVEN BEFORE I HAD 
THE PLEASURE OF WATCHING CARDIFF 
CITY PLAY AT WEMBLEY AGAIN 
YES IT'S GOING TO BE A SPECIAL DAY 
FOR DAVID MORGAN ON SEVENTEENTH MAY IT 
WILL BE A TERRIFIC OCCASION ALL 
ROUND 
IT WILL BE COMPLETELY ROUND DIFFERENT I THINK ANYONE WHO WAS 
AT THE TWO SEMIS LAST WEEKEND 
GREAT ATMOSPHERE AND I'VE NEVER 
SEEN SO MANY SUPPORTERS IN AND 
AROUND THE GROUND SO EARLY IN MY 
LIFE ALL FOUR TEAMS WANTED TO 
ENJOY IT CARDIFF HAVE A CHANCE 
JUDGING ON PORTSMOUTH'S PERFORMANCE 
AGAINST WEST BROM AND THEY DIDN'T 
LOOK ON THE DAY THAT THEY WERE 
GOING TO WIN 
WE SHOULD PLAY 
TRIBUTE TO BARNSLEY THEY PUT UP A 
FIGHT AGAINST CARDIFF 
THEY DID AND 
TO GET TO THIS COMPETITION LOOK AT 
THIS THIS WAS THE DEFINING MOMENT 
IN THE GAME THIS WILL LIVE WITH 
HIM FOR THE REST OF HIS CAREER 
BECAUSE HE SHOULD HAVE PUT THAT 
AWAY 
AGONISINGLY CLOSE 
YOU SEE AWAY QUICKLY HOW PEOPLE FORGET HE 
SCORED THE GOAL AGAINST CHELSEA 
THAT GOT THEM THERE IN THE FIRST 
PLACE 
YOU THINK PORTSMOUTH MIGHT PLACE BE TAKEN ALL THE WAY IN TERMS OF 
THE FINAL NO NO L. THINK IT'S NO NO GOING TO BE TIGHT L. TELL YOU ONE 
THING I WISH AND I HOPE I'M AS 
LUCID AS THAT GUY IS AT NINETY SEVEN SOME SOME MIGHT QUESTION THAT EVEN NOW WE 
WILL BE AT WEMBLEY FOR ALL THE 
BUILDUP 
TO SCOTLAND NOW AND RANGERS CAN 
STILL COMPLETE A UNIQUE QUADRUPLE 
TONIGHT THEY PLAY PARTICK THISTLE 
THEY ARE SEVEN POINTS CLEAR IN THE 
S. P. L. WITH A GAME IN HAND AND ALREADY 
BAGGED THE LEAGUE CUP AND REACHED 
THE UEFA CUP SEMI FINAL WITH A TWO TO ZERO 
WIN IN LISBON HAVING DRAWN ZERO TO ZERO IT 
TOOK AN HOUR BEFORE THE DEADLOCK 
WAS BROKEN THIS CROSS WENT IN NOT 
BAD FROM THE FORMER FOREST STRIKER 
AND THEN A TERRIFIC EFFORT HERE 
WITH VICTORY IN THE FINAL MINUTE 
HE LOOKS AROUND FOR SOMEONE TO 
TACKLE HIM AT FIRST AND HE THINKS 
COME ON COME AND TACKLE ME L. DID 
THIS GAME AND THAT IS THE SAD OWE 
THAT I AM AND RANGERS PLAYED REALLY 
WELL SPORTING WERE NOT THE BEST 
OPPOSITION BUT THEY HAVE TOUCH 
TIME AGAINST FI ORETNINA IN THE 
END THIS GUY DID WELL DEFENSIVELY 
IT'S JUST GREAT GREAT GOAL THAT THAT IS WHAT CONFIDENCE DOES FOR YOU 
ANY CHANCE OF THEM PROGRESSING IT 
AND MAKING IT TO MANCHESTER FOR THE 
FINAL 
TOUGH BAYERN MUNICH WERE FINAL THE STORY GAT GETAFFE WERE 
THROUGH TALK ABOUT TWO LATE GOALS 
THERE IS HOPE BECAUSE EVERTON BEAT 
THEM AT HOME BUT IT WILL BE REALLY 
TOUGH 
IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP IT'S SO TOUGH TIGHT AT THE TOP THE LEAD HAS 
CHANGED SIX TIMES IN THE PAST FEW 
WEEKS 
THE BATTLE FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
TITLE IS A CONUNDRUM THAT NO ONE 
WANTS TO RESOLVE THE LATEST TEAM 
IS WEST BROM GARY JOHNSON'S 
BRISTOL CITY LIES SECOND DESPITE 
ONE WIN IN SEVEN STOKE CITY AND 
TONY PULIS ARE THIRD JUST NINE 
POINTS FROM THEIR LAST TWENTY FOUR

FROM TEN AIDY BOOTHROYD'S WATFORD 
ARE HANGING IN THERE ON THE RAILS 
IN A WEEK WHY COMPLY OR DIE RMPED 
TO VICTORY AT AINTREE'S GRAND 
NATIONAL COURSE THE RACE FOR THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP IS A LITTLE LESS 
CLEAR CUT ROMPED IT'S A FIVE 
HORSE RACE AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW 
WHO WILL BE THE FIRST PAST THE POST 
IN A LEAGUE THAT NO ONE WANTS TO 
WIN ON THIS CHILLY APRIL EVENING 
AT VICARAGE ROAD WE CAN SEE THE 
CLUB THAT LIES FIFTH LEAPFROG THE 
OPPOSITION AND GO TOP IN THIS TOPSY 
TURVY LEAGUE THIS MISS FROM 
WATFORD'S JORDAN STEWART SET THE 
TONE FOR THE EVENING AND IT GOT 
WORSE WHEN BARNSLEY'S KAYODE 
ODEJAYI BEGAN TO PUT HIS WEMBLEY 
NIGHTMARE BEHIND HIM DEFENDER 
STEPHEN FOSTER MADE IT TWO TO ZERO 
SILENCING THE HOME AID AND AIDY 
BOOTHROYD WAS HELPLESS ON THE TOUCH 
LINE ONCE AGAIN KAYODE ODEJAYI 
COMPLETED THE GAME YET ANOTHER 
CHAMPIONSHIP SIDE FAIL TO TAKE TOP 
SPOT BARNSLEY HAVE SHAKEN OFF 
THEIR F. A. CUP BLUES AND LEAVING AIDY 
BOOTHROYD WITH A LOT TO THINK ABOUT 
AND THINK ABOUT IT HE DID THE THE 
NEXT MORNING I MET A WATFORD 
MANAGER DETERMINED TO HOLD HIS 
NERVE AND GUIDE HIS SIDE BACK TO 
THE TOP IT'S THE MORNING AFTER THE 
NIGHT BEFORE HOW HAS DESPAIR 
GONE AWAY YET 
NO NOT QUITE YOU 
WILL BE ABLE TO GATHER FROM MY EYES 
THAT I DIDN'T GET VERY MUCH SLEEP 
LAST NIGHT ALONG WITH AROUND 
FIFTEEN THOUSAND OTHER WATFORD FANS AND 
CERTAINLYLY THE TEAM AND THE GROUP 
OF STAFF SO DISAPPOINTED 
DISAPPOINTED BUT YOU KNOW EVEN 
NOW AS I WAS REMINDED THIS MORNING 
BOSS WE STILL HAVE FOUR GAMES TO 
PLAY AND TWO POINTS OFF THE TOP 
WOULD WE HAVE TAKEN THAT YES I 
WOULD AND SAT THE SAME TIME YOU GET 
THE OPPORTUNITIES TO GO TOP YOU 
WANT TO TAKE THEM AND IT'S SO 
IRRITATING WHEN YOU DON'T AND 
THAT'S NOT JUST US BUT EVERY OTHER 
TEAM 
YOU HAVE LOOKED AT THE MATHS TEAM YOU HAVE FOUR LEFT HAVE YOU SORT 
OF SAID A NUMBER OF POINTS SHOULD 
CLINCH IT OR ARE YOU JUST MORE 
PRAGMATIC THAN THAT 
I HAVE DONE IT 
AND I'VE LOOKED AT IT AND I'VE THAW 
WELL THAT WOULD BE LIKE IN A 
NORMAL LEAGUE BUT THIS IS NOT 
NORMAL IT WILL BE THE LOWEST 
POINTS EVER IN SECOND IT MIGHT NOT 
BE EIGHTEEN THAT DOES IT THAT WILL BE 
THE LOWEST EVER AND I THINK IT WILL 
BE THE HIGHEST IT WILL BE FIFTY TWO FIFTY THREE 
POSSIBLY FIFTY FOUR THAT KEEPS TEAMS UP 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE LEAGUES WHERE IT 
IS DIFFICULT TO KIND OF IF YOU 
ARE A BETTING MAN YOU WOULD CHOSE A 
DIFFERENT LEAGUE TO BET ON 
YOU BET 
ON WATFORD GOING UP WOULDN'T YOU 
I WOULD YEAH BECAUSE I WORK HERE 
AND I KNOW THE PEOPLE AND I KNOW 
THE PLAYERS L. KNOW WHAT THEY ARE 
CAPABLE OF TALK IS KEEP IT'S 
TO DO SIMPLE AS THAT 
IT'S AN 
EXTRAORDINARY SEASON IN THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP THIS TIME AROUND IT 
IS THE LEAGUE NOBODY WANTS TO WIN 
APPARENTLY 
WELL I THINK THEY ALL APPARENTLY WANT TO WIN IT NOBODY CAN IT'S 
THE STATISTIC THIS MORNING THAT EIGHTEEN 
TEAMS IN THAT LEAGUE CAN STILL BE 
MATHEMATICALLY STILL BE PROMOTED L. 
SAID THE OTHER WEEK AND MY MAIL BAG 
HAS BEEN COMPLETELY FULL WHICH IS 
THE WEAKEST CHAMPIONSHIP IT HAS 
BEEN FOR A LONG TIME L. S. T. I. BELIEVE 
IT IS IF YOU TURN THAT ON ITS HEAD 
AND THINK IF YOU ARE IN THE BOTTOM 
SIX OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE THIS 
YEAR IF YOU STAY IN THAT LEAGUE 
THE PREMIER LEAGUE AND YOU LOOK AT 
THE QUALITY OR LACK OF QUALITY OF 
THE TEAMS WHO ARE COMING UP IF YOU 
ARE THE CHAIRMAN YOU ARE THINKING 
HAPPY DAYS THEN ALSO IF YOU TAKE 
THAT STEP FURTHER BOLTON SELL 
ANELKA AND DON'T REPLACE HIM THEY 
DIDN'T GAMBLE TO STAY IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE AND GET THE THIRTY 
MILLION KNOWING THE THREE WHO COME 
UP WILL BE A LOT WEAKER 
IF YOU 
LOOK THE THE CHAMPIONSHIP TEAMS IN 
THE F. A. CUP THEY'VE DONE WELL WEST 
BROM BARNSLEY CARDIFF 
THERE IS A 
MARK OVER THE STANDARD OF THE 
LEAGUE 
I THINK IT DOES THERE ARE LEAGUE NOT MANY PLAYING FOOTBALL WEST 
BROM ARE THE BEST SIDE WE WATCHED 
THE STOKE MATCH AND THERE WASN'T A 
GREAT DEAL OF FOOTBALL PLAYED WEST WEST BROM ARE TOP AND SAY IF THEY GO UP 
THAT IS THE TEAM THAT HAS LOST ONE 
QUARTER OF THEIR GAMES IN THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
THEY SCORE GOALS CHAMPIONSHIP THINK YOU TAKE TESTIMONY SEPARATE 
FROM THE OTHERS BECAUSE THEY ARE 
NOT GOOD AT THE BACK BUT THEY 
SCORE GOALS THE THING ABOUT 
STAYING IN THE PREMIERSHIP IS IT IS 
SCORING ENOUGH GOALS THAT IS HOW 
WHEN PEOPLE COME UP WE ALWAYS LOOK 
AT THEM AND WE GO RIGHT WHO IS 
GOING TO SCORE THE GOALS 
LOOK AT 
THE FORM GUIDE 
HULL MAY BE TOO MUCH IN FORM THEY 
MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A TROUGH 
THAT MIGHT BE ENOUGH THE MOMENTUM 
THEY NEED THINK WEST BROM AND 
PERHAPS HULL ALONGSIDE THEM BUT IT 
IS ONLY ONE FROM ANOTHER TWELVE SIDES 
I TELL YOU WHO HAVE BEEN 
INTERESTING IS CRYSTAL PALACE 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE PLAYED YOUNG 
PLAYERS AND THEY HAVE GOT 
THEMSELVES IN THE PLAYOFFS THERE THERE WAS NO FOOTBALL FOCUS LAST WEEK BUT 
WE WANTED TO PLAY TRIBUTE TO JIM 
FINNEY ENGLAND'S MOST FAMOUS 
REFEREE OF THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WHO PASSED 
AWAY ON FIRST APRIL AT EIGHTY THREE HE REFER 
REED THE NINETEEN SIXTY TWO F. A. CUP FINAL AT 
WEMBLEY BY SPURS AND BURNLEY THE 
SPURS CAM TIN PRESENTED HIM WITH

THE WORLD CUP IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND WAS IN 
CHARGE OF THE QUARTER FINAL BETWEEN 
WEST GERMANY AND URAGUAY SENDING 
OFF TWO URAGUAYIANS AS THEY LOST FOUR 
ZERO HE WAS RULED OUT OF REFER RUGBY 
LEAGUE IN THE FINAL BECAUSE ENGLAND 
WERE IN IT 
YOU KNOW I THINK THE GREAT THING

SLOWLY WORKING IN FAIRNESS FOR THE 
PLAYERS 
WELL THAT IS IT FROM US PLAYERS MARTIN AND LAWRO THANK YOU PRESS
