HELLO 
WE'RE FROM STAFFORDSHIRE 
THERE IS IT 
WE PLAY SPECIAL INSTRUMENTS CALLED STEEL PANS 
THEY MAKE LOVELY SUMMERY SOUNDING MUSIC 
YES THE STEEL PANS MAKE YOU THINK OF HOT SUNSHINE 
LOVELY BEACHES AND SANDCASTLES 
COOL ICE CREAM 
SO WHAT BETTER PLACE TO PERFORM FOR YOU THAN IN A SNOWDOME 
WHAT A SNOWDOME WITH SNOW YES OF COURSE 
O. K. THEN I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO COLD FOR OUR SURFING MUSIC 
SEE YOU IN THERE 
WIPE OUT 
THAT WAS A BIT CHILLY 
WE NEED TO GET CHANGED INTO WARMER CLOTHES 
THAT'S BETTER NOW WE LOOK THE PART IN THIS SNOW 
THIS IS FUN AND OUR NEXT PERFORMANCE IS FULL OF FUN TOO 
WHEN CAN WE SEE THE SHARK
