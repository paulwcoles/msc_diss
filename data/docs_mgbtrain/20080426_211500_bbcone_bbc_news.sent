TONIGHT AS REFINERY WORKERS 
PREPARE TO STRIKE 
TONIGHT AS REFINERY WORKERS PREPARE TO STRIKE 
PREPARE TO STRIKE THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS THERE ARE 
PLENTIFUL STOCKS OF PETROL AND 
DIESEL BUT THE INDUSTRY CALLS ON 
MINISTERS TO STEP IN 
WHAT WE ARE 
CALLING UPON THE GOVERNMENT TO DO 
NOW IS TO GET THE TWO PARTIES IN 
THIS DISPUTE INEOS AND UNITE TO 
THE AND BASH THEIR HEADS TOGETHER 
AND GET SENSE INTO THIS WEEKS WEEKS AFTER ZIMBABWE'S PRESIDENTAL 
ELECTION THE AUTHORITIES SAY THEY 
ARE PREPARING TO DECLARE THE 
RESULTS RESULTS THE DOG WITH RABIES THAT BIT THREE 
PEOPLE AT A BRITISH QUARANTINE 
CENTRE CENTRE AND ANOTHER BLOW FOR LEWIS HAMILTON 
AS KIMI RAIKKONEN TAKES POLE IN THE 
SPANISH GRAND PRIX 
GOOD EVENING TO YOU B. P. ARE TONIGHT 
SHUTTING DOWN A KEY PIPELINE THAT 
DELIVERS MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF THE 
U. K.'S OIL PRODUCTION IT COMES AS 
WORKERS AT SCOTLAND'S BIGGEST 
REFINERY PREPARE TO GO ON STRIKE 
FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING IN A 
DISPUTE OVER PENSIONS 
WELL THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS THERE 
ARE SUFFICIENT STOCKS OF FUEL BUT 
THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY HAS CALLED 
ON MINISTERS TO INTERVENE TO SETTLE 
THE DISPUTE ANDREW CASSELL IS THE 
A GRANGEMOUTH 
TONIGHT WITH PRODUCTION HALTED AT 
THE GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY THEY ARE 
PREPARING FOR TOMORROW'S WALKOUT 
BUT THE STRIKE BY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED WORKERS 
HERE MEANS THAT UP TO EIGHTY PLATFORMS 
IN THE NORTH SEA WHICH PUMP THEIR 
OIL DIRECTLY INTO B. P.'S KINNEIL 
PLANT NEXT DOOR WILL ALSO HAVE TO 
STOP OPERATIONS THAT'S PROMPTED 
FRESH CALLS FOR URGENT GOVERNMENT 
INTERVENTION 
WHAT WE ARE CALLING INTERVENTION UPON THE GOVERNMENT TO DO NOW IS TO 
GET THE TWO PARTIES IN THIS DISPUTE 
INEOS AND UNITE TOGETHER AND BASH 
THEIR HEADS TOGETHER AND GET SENSE 
INTO THIS IT IS UNNECESSARY IT 
ONLY TAKES A MODICUM OF EXTRA 
EFFORT TO PROVIDE THE ESSENTIAL 
UTILITIES TO THE PLANT AT KINNEIL 
THE FORTIES PIPELINE IS CRUCIAL TO 
BRITAIN'S OIL SUPPLIES B. P. HAS 
CONFIRMED IT WILL BE SHUT DOWN 
OVERNIGHT THAT WILL STOP NEARLY 
FORTY PER CENT OF THE U. K.'S OIL GETTING ASHORE 
AND THIRTY PER CENT OF THE NATURAL GAS OUTPUT 
EVEN SO MINISTERS INSIST THERE IS 
NO IMMINENT FUEL CRISIS 
THERE IS 
ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF BOTH PETROL 
AND DIESEL IN SCOTLAND TO TAKE US 
THROUGH THIS PERIOD AND BEYOND WE 
HAVE BEEN STOCKPILING AND BUILDING 
UP SUPPLIES IN SCOTLAND KNOWING 
THIS DISPUTE WAS LIKELY TO HA THE 
MESSAGE FOR EVERYONE IN SCOTLAND IS 
THAT THERE IS ENOUGH PETROL OR 
DIESLE 
TODAY LORRIES ADENED WITH DIESLE FUEL WERE STILL LEAVING THE 
GRANGEMOUTH DEPOT BUT EFFORTS TO 
SHIP FOREIGN TOIL AUGMENT THE 
STOCKS HAVE FAILED BECAUSE THE 
COMPANY SAYS IT CAN'T GET AGREEMENT 
TO UNLOAD THE VESSELS 
AT THE 
MOMENT THE TRADE UNION'S POSITION 
IS THAT THEY NEED ASSURANCE THAT IS 
ANY FUEL LEAVING THE SITE DURING 
THE STRIKE PERIOD WOULD ONLY BE 
SUPPLIED TO THE ESSENTIAL SERVICES 
INEOS SAYS THAT COULD LEAD TO 
SHORTAGES IN THE HIGHLAND AND 
ISLANDS BUT ACROSS MUCH OF SCOTLAND 
FUEL STATIONS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN 
LESS BUSY THAN IN RECENT DAYS MOST 
MOTORISTS IT SEEMS HAVE ALREADY 
TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO FILL UP 
WELL WE CAN TALK TO ANDY NOW 
IT LOOKS LIKE DEADLOCK THIS EVENING 
IS THERE A DANGE THEY ARE DISPUTE 
COULD REALLY ESCALATE AND GET OUT 
OF HAND 
BEN IN SHORT THERE IS 
EVERY CHANCE LEAVE ASIDE THE ISSUE 
OF THE FUEL CRISIS OR THE CHANCES 
OF TRYING TO KEEP THE FORECOURTS 
SUPPLIED WITH PETROL AND DIESEL 
ONE OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS HERE IS 
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THIS TWO DAY 
STRIKE IS OVER WHERE IS THE COMMON 
GROUND FOR THE TWO SIDES TO COME 
TOGETHER THE UNION HAS MADE IT 
QUITE CLEAR TODAY THAT IN THE IN 
THE WEEKS AFTER THE STRIKE THERE IS 
NO COMPROMISE ON THE PART OF THE 
COMPANY AS THEY PUT IT ON THIS 
ISSUE OF FINAL SALARY PENSION 
SCHEMES THEN THEY WILL ESCALATE 
THEIR ACTION THAT I THINK IS WHY 
YOU ARE SEEING GROWING CONCERNS 
EXPRESSED BY MEMBERS INSIDE THE 
BRITISH OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY 
AFTER WEEKS OF SILENCE ZIMBABWE'S 
ELECTORAL COMMISSION HAS SAID IT IS 
PREPARING TO ANNOUNCE THE WINNER OF 
THE COUNTRY'S PRESIDENTAL ELECTION 
EARLY NEXT WEEK 
PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE AND HIS 
CHALLENGER THE OPPOSITION LEADER 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI HAVE BEEN TOLD 
THAT THE VOTES HAVE BEEN COUNTED 
AND THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO 
VERIFY THE RESULTS BEFORE THEY ARE 
PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED CAROLINE HAWLEY 
REPORTS FROM JOHANNESBURG 
FOUR WEEKS AFTER THE DISPUTED 
ELECTIONS THIS MAN HAS CONTINUED 
TO CLING TO POWER 
USING THE MACHINERY OF STATE THE 
OPPOSITION SAYS IT WON THE 
PRESIDENTIAL POLL BUT ROBERT MUGABE 
HAS DUG IN HIS HEELS TODAY AFTER 
A LONG SILENCE FINALLY WORD FROM 
ZIMBABWE'S ELECTORAL COMMISSION BY 
MONDAY IT SAYS AFTER RE COUNT 
BALLOT FIGURES WILL AT LAST HAVE 
BEEN PROPERLY PROCESSED THE THE RETURNING OFFICER WHO IS THE CHIEF 
ELECTIONS OFFICER WILL INVITE THE 
FOUR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES OR 
THEIR AGENTS TO A VERIFICATION AND 
COLLATION EXERCISE LEADING TO THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE RESULTS OF THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
HE IS HERE 
IS THE MAN WHO BELIEVES HE WON HE 
SAYS HE WON'T PARTICIPATE IN ANY 
RUN OFF AND SO ZIMBABWEANS WAIT 
AND IN THE POLITICAL VACUUM THERE 
ARE FEARS THE VIOLENCE AND 
INTIMIDATION WILL ONLY INCREASE 
ROUNDED UP YESTERDAY N. E. A R. L. Y. ZERO ZERO 
OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS ARE STILL IN 
CUSTODY TONIGHT SO FAR NO CHARGES 
A PARTIAL RECOUNT OF THE 
PARLIAMENTARY POLLS APPEARS TO SHOW 
THAT THE OPPOSITION DID WIN THE 
HISTORIC MAJORITY IT CLAIMED SO IF 
ROBERT MUGABE DOES SUCCEED IN 
STAYING IN OFFICE HE WILL HAVE TO 
DEAL WITH THE PARLIAMENT THAT'S 
WORKING AGAINST HIM THE MAN WHO 
HAS RULED ZIMBABWE FOR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS IS 
NOW UNDER GROWING PRESSURE BOTH AT 
HOME AND ABROAD AND NO ONE KNOWS 
QUITE HOW HE'LL RESPOND 
HERE THREE PEOPLE ARE BEING 
TREATED FOR EXPOSURE TO RABIES 
AFTER THEY WERE BITTEN BY A DOG 
INFECTED WITH THE DISEASE THE 
PUPPY WAS BEING HELD IN QUARANTINE 
AFTER BEING BROUGHT INTO THE U. K. 
FROM SRI LANKA NONE OF THE THREE 
PEOPLE WHO WERE BITTEN ARE SHOWING 
ANY SIGNS OF ILL HEALTH 
THIS IS THE KENNEL AT THE CENTRE OF 
THE RABIES SCARE TODAY ONLY STAFF 
WERE ALLOWED BEHIND THESE GATES 
FIVE PUPPIES BROUGHT FROM SRI 
LANKA BY A BRITISH ANIMAL CHARITY 
SHOWED SIGNS OF ILLNESS AND WERE 
PLACED IN ISOLATION ONE WHICH HAS 
SINCE DIED OF RABIES BIT THREE 
PEOPLE TWO WERE WORKERS AT THE 
CENTRE THE THIRD THIS WOMAN RUNS 
ANIMAL S. O. S. SRI LANKA AND BRUGT THE 
PUPPIES INTO THE COUNTRY BROUGHT 
THE PUPPIES 
I NOTICED SHE WAS 
SNAPPED AND WENT TO FIGHT WITH 
ANOTHER PUPPY L. PARTED THEM AND 
THAT'S WHEN I HAD A COUPLE OF NIPS 
ON MY HAND ON MY WRIST AREA AND A 
NIP ON MY CHIN 
ALL THREE RECEIVED 
TREATMENT AT THIS LOCAL HOSPITAL 
THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN GIVEN 
RABIES VACCINES SO HAD BOOSTERS AS 
A PRECAUTION THEIR RISK OF 
DEVELOPING THE DISEASE IS SAID TO 
BE MINIMAL AND THE KENNEL'S OWNERS 
INSIST PROPERLY PROCEDURES WERE 
FOLLOWED 
IT IS TO 
THE CREDIT OF FOLLOWED THE VETS AND THE STAFF I BELIEVE 
THAT THE ILLNESS WAS RECOGNISED AND 
THIS OF COURSE LED TO THERE BEING 
NO RISK WHATSOEVER OF THEM CROSS 
INFECTING OTHER ANIMALS IN OUR CARE 
BRITAIN HAS TOUGH LAWS FOR ANIMALS 
ENTERING THE COUNTRY SO RABIES HAS 
BEEN VIRTUALLY ERADICATED FROM 
ANIMALS WITHIN THE U. K. FOR MANY 
YEARS THE QUARANTINE LAWS ARE 
DESIGNED TO PREVENT ANY IMPORTED 
ANIMAL WERE SPREADING THE DISEASE 
TO OTHER ANIMALS BUT VETS SAY 
THERE ARE PROPOSALS TO RELAX THESE 
LAWS LAWS IT'LL BE FEW DAYS BEFORE WE KNOW 
THE STRAIN OF THE RABIES OR ITS 
SOURCE BUT IT SEEMS AS IF THE 
QUICK ACTION OF STAFF HERE HAS 
PREVENTED THE FROM SPREADING ANY 
FURTHER FURTHER AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SAY THAT 
THERE IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE BEEN ANY 
RISK TO PUBLIC HEALTH
