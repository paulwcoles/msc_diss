FOLLOWING TWO DAYS OF VIOLENT ANTI 
CHINESE PROTEST HERE AND IN PARIS 
B. B. C. LONDON HAS LEARNED THAT 
ORGANISERS OF THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE GAMES ARE TO 
SCALE BACK THEIR TORCH RELAY IN 
FOUR YEARS' TIME 
NO MORE WORLD TOURS FOR THIS FAMOUS 
FLAME WE HAVE LEARNED THERE ARE 
SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT IN THE OLYMPIC 
MOVEMENT FOR THE LONDON TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TORCH 
RELAY TO BE LARGELY A NATIONAL 
AFFAIR SCENES LIKE THIS YESTERDAY 
FOR THE BAYYING RELAY HAVE 
EFFECTIVELY PUT AN END TO THE 
GLOBAL TOUR THE IDEA OF TAKING THE 
FLAME AROUND THE WORLD WAS 
INTRODUCED FOR THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR ATHENS 
GAMES BUT THE NOISY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RELAY HAS 
BECOME LESS ABOUT THE OLYMPICS AND 
MORE ABOUT CHINA AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT INTERNATIONAL 
OLYMPIC OFFICIALS HAVE ALREADY 
DISCUSSED THE RETURN TO A NATIONAL 
RELAY AND THAT LONDON TWO THOUSAND TWELVE ARE ALSO 
BELIEVED TO BE IN FAVOUR OF IT 
THAT MEANS USING THE TORCH TO 
GALVANISE SUPPORT ACROSS BRITAIN 
ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH WHERE 
PEOPLE ARE MORE SCEPTICAL ABOUT THE 
BENEFITS OF THE GAMES WITH ALL 
THIS CONTROVERSY OVER BEIJING HAVE 
AN IMPACT ON TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
PEOPLE ARE NOT 
AGAINST THE OLYMPICS THEY'RE 
RAISING ISSUES RELEVANT IN THE HOST 
COUNTRY MAYBE IN FOUR YEARS' TIME 
THERE WILL BE AN ISSUE THAT PEOPLE 
WILL RAISE ABOUT LONDON L. DON'T 
THINK SO 
IT WASN'T A GOOD WEEKEND 
FOR THE CAPITAL 
THIS WAS NOT A 
GOOD ADVERTISEMENT FOR LONDON 
PEACEFUL PROTEST IS ONE THING POOR 
OLD KONNIE HUQ HAVING THE FLAME 
WRESTLED FROM HER GRASP IS NOT A 
GOOD AD FOR LONDON 
WITH SOMETHING 
LIKE TIBET WHERE FEELINGS RUN SO 
HIGH THERE WILL BE DEMONSTRATIONS 
AND A GREAT DEAL OF STRONG PUBLIC 
FEELING BUT YOU'VE GOT TO ASK 
YOURSELF SHOULD WE GO TO BEIJING 
SHOULD OUR ATHLETES GO THERE OR 
SHOULD THEY NOT L. THINK 
FUNDAMENTALLY THEY SHOULD 
WE HAD 
TO HAVE THE TORCH RELAY SAD IT WAS 
MISERABLE WEATHER INSTEAD OF HALF 
A MILLION LONDONERS LINING THE 
STREETS REALLY IT WAS THE PERFECT 
PROTESTERS IT GAVE QUITE THE 
WRONG IMAGE 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT 
OLYMPIC ORGANISERS WANT TO AVOID IN 
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AFTER THE DISRUPTION AT HEATHROW'S 
TERMINAL FIVE WHICH LEFT FLIGHTS 
CANCELLED AND THOUSANDS OF BAGS 
STRANDED PILOTS HAVE ACCUSED THE 
MANAGEMENT OF BRITISH AIRWAYS OF 
MAKING THE BRAND A LAUGHING STOCK 
THE UNION BALPA MADE THE COMMENTS 
IN A LETTER TO THE CITY AND THE 
GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT A SOLICITOR WHO STOLE MORE THAN ONE 
MILLION FROM A PERSONAL INJURY 
CLIENT HAS BEEN JAILED FOR TEN 
YEARS FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD KEITH ANDERSON 
WAS AWARDED COMPENSATION AFTER 
BEING PARALYSED IN A CAR CRASH 
THOMAS MCGOLDRICK WAS CONVICTED OF 
FIFTY THREE CHARGES 
CANNABIS SWEETS HAVE BEEN SOLD TO 
CHILDREN IN A SHOP IN SOUTH WEST 
LONDON NO LOU HAS BEEN BROKEN AS 
THE SWEET DOESN'T CONTAIN ANY 
INGREDIENTS FOUND IN THE DRUG IT'S 
CAUSED OUTRAGE AMONGST LOCAL 
PARENTS PARENTS LONDIS IN SOUTH WEST LONDON 
LOCALLY BEST FOR CONFECTIONARY 
AERO MUNCHIES FLAKE CANNABIS 
IT'S MADE IN SWITZERLAND THERE'S 
NO PSYCHO ACTIVE INGREDIENT IT'S 
LEGAL TO MAKE AND SELL ONE MOTHER 
THINKS IT SHOULDN'T BE THOUGH AT 
LEAST NOT ON THE SWEET COUNTER MY MY PROBLEM WITH IT IS THAT IT'S 
TRADING ON A NAME WHICH IS THE NAME 
OF A SOFT DRUG ONE OF MANY NAMES 
OF SOFT DRUGS IT DESENSE TIESS 
CHILDREN TO THE FACT THAT IT'S 
SOMETHING THAT THEY NEED TO BE 
CAUTIOUS OF 
THIS WOMAN IS A HEALTH 
PROFESSIONAL AND LECTURER SHE'S 
VERY PERSUASIVE SOON OTHER MUMS ON 
THE SCHOOL RUN ARE TRYING CANNABIS 
IT'S DESIGNED TO MAKE THEM THINK 
CANNABIS IS COOL 
IT'S LIKE A 
MEDICINE TASTE 
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT 
THE LEGALITY BUT MORALLY IT'S NOT 
A GOOD IDEA 
THE SWEET IS MADE BY A 
COMPANY CALLED SWISSMINTS THEY 
SAID CANNABIS IS THE LATIN NAME FOR 
THE HEMP FLOWER AND POINTED OUT 
THERE IS A PERFUME CALLED OPIUM 
WHICH IS PERFECTLY LEGAL TO SELL 
IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE ONE OF THE 
MOTHERS WAS CHOSEN AS A 
SPOKESPERSON WAS MICED UP AND SENT 
INTO THE SHOP 
YOU'VE GOT THESE 
SWEETS AND DO YOU THINK IT'S 
APPROPRIATE TO SELL THESE TO 
CHILDREN 
NOT REALLY FOR THE CHILDREN CHILDREN 
AN ERROR OF JUDGMENT HAS CHILDREN BEEN MADE IT DOESN'T GO WITH KIDS 
AND SWEETS L. HAVE INSTRUCTED THE 
MANAGER TO TAKE IT OFF THE SHELF 
IMMEDIATELY 
WHICH IS JUST AS WELL IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE TODAY RICHMOND TRADING 
STANDARDS TOLD US THAT THEY'RE WITH 
THE SCHOOL RUN MUMS ON THIS ONE AND 
DON'T CONDONE THE USE OF CANNABIS 
IN CONNECTION WITH SWEETS 
SIX MASAI WARRIORS WHO WILL RUN THE 
LONDON MARATHON IN FULL WARRIOR 
DRESS HAVE BEEN JOGING ROUND 
TRAFALGAR SQUARE TO GET USED TO 
CONDITIONS THEY WANT TO RAISE 
SIXTY THOUSAND TO PROVIDE CLEAN WATER IN
