THE PEOPLE THAT SAT IN DARKNESS HAD SEEN 
JESUS WALKING BY THE SEA OF GALILEE 
CASTING A NET INTO THE SEA 
HE SAW TWO OTHER FRIENDS JAMES THE SON OF ZEBEDEE 
AND HE SAYETH TO THEM COME YE AFTER ME AND I WILL MAKE YOU BE FISHERS OF MEN 
WHY ARE PEOPLE SAINTS 
WHY DO SOME PEOPLE ATTRACT WORSHIP VENERATION RATHER THAN OTHER PEOPLE 
MOTHER TERESA SAID A SAINT IS A PENCIL IN THE HAND OF GOD 
THE SAINT IS NOT NECESSARILY A GOOD PERSON 
IT IS SOMEBODY WHO IS REACHING OUT FOR SOMETHING 
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE APOSTLES THE BLESSED MOTHERS ANGELS 
YOU TALK ABOUT THESE EARLY FIGURES AS BEING CLOSEST TO GOD BECAUSE OF 
THEIR PARTICULAR MOMENT IN LIFE THAT THEY LIVED WITH CHRIST 
THEY WORKED WITH CHRIST SO THAT GRADUALLY IN THE VERY FIRST CENTURIES 
THERE WAS A SPONTANEOUS NATURAL DEVOTION TO THESE PEOPLE WHO WERE CLOSEST TO CHRIST 
CLOSENESS TO CHRIST BEING THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENT DOWN THROUGH THE CENTURIES AS TO WHAT IS A SAINT 
IN OTHER WORDS THAT LIFE IN CHRIST BEGINS ON EARTH 
AS YOU LIVE AND IS BROUGHT TO ITS FULLNESS ITS FRUITION IN HEAVEN 
ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK AND THIS HAS A RELATION TO THE SAINTS 
IS THAT I DON'T THINK THE CHURCH IS ABOUT MORALITY 
I THINK THE LAST THING IT IS ABOUT IS MORALITY 
BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT'S INTERPRETED 
I THINK THAT'S A PITY BECAUSE I THINK MORALITY IS FOR ALL OF US 
TO ME SAINTS ARE ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF GOD IN THE WORLD 
AND I FIND THAT A MUCH MORE POWERFUL CONCEPT THAN THE MOTION THAT THEY ARE EXEMPLARS TO FOLLOW 
THE ODDER THE LIFE THEY LEAD THE MORE I BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE TRUE 
IN A DOWNSTAIRS ROOM FOUR WRITERS HAVE GATHERED TOGETHER TO EAT DRINK 
AND WRESTLE WITH THE IDEA OF SAINTHOOD 
MICHAEL WALSH IS A FORMER JESUIT PRIEST WHO HAS WRITTEN BOOKS ON OPUS DEI CATHOLIC CATECHETICS 
AND IS CURRENTLY COMPILING A DICTIONARY OF SAINTS 
WILLIAM DALRYMPLE IS A TRAVEL WRITER AND HISTORIAN 
HIS WORK IS MUCH PREOCCUPIED WITH THE EASTERN ROOTS OF CHRISTIANITY 
AND CHRISTIANITY'S RELATIONSHIP WITH ISLAM 
MARINA WARNER IS A NOVELIST AND CULTURAL HISTORIAN 
HER WORK MOVES WITH EASE FROM FOLKLORE AND FAIRYTALES 
TO JOAN OF ARC AND JEAN LUC GODARD 
CIARAN CARSON IS A POET AND TRANSLATOR OF DANTE'S INFERNO 
HE ALSO WRITES UNCLASSIFIABLE PROSE 
IMAGINE THE CHANCE ENCOUNTER AT A SEWING CLASS IN BELFAST OF JORGE LUIS BORGES AND BRENDAN BEHAN 
JAMES WAS BEHEADED ON TWENTY FIFTH MARCH THE FEAST OF THE LORD'S ENUNCIATION 
AND WAS TRANSFERRED TO COMPOSTELA ON TWENTY FIFTH JULY 
AFTER JAMES WAS BEHEADED HIS DISCIPLES WENT AT NIGHT 
GOT HIS BODY AND PUT IT ABOARD A RUDDERLESS BOAT 
COMMENDING THE BURIAL TO DIVINE PROVIDENCE THEY SET SAIL AN ANGEL 
OF THE LORD BEING THEIR PILOT AND MADE PORT IN GALICIA SPAIN 
THEY CARRIED THE SAINT'S BODY OFF THE BOAT AND LAID IT ON A LARGE ROCK 
AND THE ROCK PROMPTLY SOFTENED 
MIRACULOUSLY SHAPING ITSELF INTO A SARCOPHAGUS FOR THE BODY 
THAT WHOLE THING 
THE IDEA OF THE ICON OF THE SAINT IS SHE IS FROM HERE 
AND THAT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT IN THIS SMALL TOWN LAND 
THE SAINT WOULD HAVE A ROD OR STAFF BANG ON A ROCK 
IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO FIND WHAT PROPORTION OF PLACE NAMES 
EVERY K. I. L. SOMETHING IS A SAINT ISN'T IT KILMARTIN OR KILPATRICK 
THAT'S CELTIC NAMES IN GENERAL 
YES CORNWALL IS PARTICULARLY SO AND ALSO WALES 
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE 
ALL SORTS OF SAINTS WHOSE NAMES ARE PLACES 
BUT YOUR POINT ABOUT THE GEOGRAPHY 
WHERE IT'S TO DO WITH A ROCK OR A SPRING OR A MIRACULOUS 
A ROCK OR A HOLE OR A STONE WHERE THE SAINT HAD HIS HAND ON THE STONE 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY ABOUT THE EARTH AND THE ROCKS 
THERE ARE TWO THINGS ABOUT THAT 
ONE IS THAT IT CONNECTS TO THE PAST AND TO IDEAS 
THAT ARE MUCH OLDER THAN CHRISTIANITY OF A SACRED PLACE 
AND THAT'S OFTEN TO DO WITH THE BOUNTY OF THE PLACE THE WATER THE SHELTER WHATEVER 
AND SOMETIMES THE ORACULAR NATURE OF THE CAVE 
BUT ALSO IT UNCOUPLES IT COMPLETELY FROM MORALITY 
THIS IS THE MIRACLE OF DISCOVERING SOMETHING NOTHING TO DO WITH SANCTITY OR HOLINESS 
IT IS TO DO WITH THE MIRACLE WORK IN PRESENCE 
THE SAINT IS THE PERSON WHO REVEALS THE PLACE WHO BECOMES 
THE NAME ATTACHED BECAUSE HE OR SHE WAS THE FOUNDER 
OF THIS FOUNT OF SANCTITY 
AND THE PROPHET TOO 
IT'S CONNECTED TO PROPHECY IT BECOMES QUITE MODERN 
IT'S QUITE A MODERN FORM AS WELL BERNADETTE DID THAT AT LOURDES 
SHE SCRAPES THE GROUND AND A SPRING COMES 
AND THEN OF COURSE SHE IS THE CHOSEN ONE AND THEREFORE HER LIFE 
SHE'S A YOUNG POOR PIOUS GIRL 
AFFLICTED WITH SOME DIFFICULTIES SO SHE IS A HOLY PERSON 
I'M NOT SAYING THESE PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE MORAL THEMSELVES 
THAT'S NOT A NECESSARY CONDITION TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE HOLY PLACE 
THE HOLY PLACE MAKES THEM RATHER THAN THEY MAKE THE PLACE 
I HAD THE IDEA OF TWO MEN WALKING FROM PARIS 
TO SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA IN SPAIN AS IF THEY WERE PILGRIMS 
THIS IDEA CAME QUITE EARLY IF I REMEMBER THE IDEA OF 
HAVING TWO MEN WALKING 
WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT THEM EXCEPT THAT THEY ARE NOT RICH 
WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE INNOCENT 
IF THEY HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME IF THEY ARE THIEVES AT ALL 
THE ONLY THING WE KNOW IS THEY ARE WALKING TODAY BUT 
THEY HAVE THAT CAPACITY 
TO GO FROM TODAY TO THE PAST 
AND TO GO TO THE FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE TO PALESTINE TO ROME AND OTHER COUNTRIES 
IN OTHER WORDS THE FIRST IDEA WAS TO ABOLISH TIME AND SPACE 
I LIKE THIS IDEA OF WALKING 
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL IMAGE THE FACT IS 
WHAT WE SAY IN THE MILKY WAY 
WE GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE ON THE SURFACE OF EARTH 
WE SUPPOSE WE DECLARE WE DECIDE THAT THIS PLACE IS SACRED 
WE REGARD THIS LIFE ITSELF AS A PILGRIMAGE AS A JOURNEY 
AND THE GOAL IS HEAVEN AS WE WANT TO GET THERE 
IT IS SOME KIND OF SPIRITUAL EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT CATHOLIC AND YOU HAVE NO RELIGION 
IT'S LIKE YOU SEE A LOT OF THINGS ALSO THIS CHURCH 
THERE ARE PLACES TO THINK 
IT'S LIKE SOME KIND OF TEST 
YOU NEED TO TEST YOURSELF 
I REALLY DON'T THINK ABOUT SAINTS 
I DON'T KNOW REALLY WHAT SAINT JAMES DID I JUST HEARD A BIT OF IT BUT NOT REALLY 
NOTHING ESPECIALLY 
I JUST KNOW THAT HE WAS WALKING AROUND HERE AND I'VE HEARD 
SOME OF THE STORIES AROUND HERE BUT NO NOT MUCH 
JAMES WAS REALLY I WOULD SAY 
THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT WORD MUCH MORE A FRIEND OF CHRIST 
SAINT JAMES WAS ALWAYS ONE OF THE THREE MENTIONED 
PETER JAMES AND JOHN ARE THE ONES WHO ARE TAKEN IN A SPECIAL WAY 
TO DIFFERENT SITUATIONS WITH THE LORD 
SAINT JAMES WAS A MAJOR APOSTLE OF CHRIST 
WHO WAS PRESENT AT THE TRANSFIGURATION 
NOT ALL THE APOSTLES WERE THERE 
SO CHRIST WAS SHOWING AT LEAST BY THIS FACT 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT CHRIST WAS PARTICULARLY IN FAVOUR OF THIS SAINT 
HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST APOSTLE MARTYRS 
WHEN HE WAS EXECUTED IN THE REIGN OF HEROD AGRIPPA 
BECAUSE THEY WERE FAITHFUL TO CHRIST 
BECAUSE THEY FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY IN THEIR VIOLENT DEATH AND MARTYRDOM 
THEY MADE THE GRADE THEY GOT THE CROWN 
THEY BLED AS CHRIST BLED 
IT MADE THE CHURCH THE BLOOD OF THE MARTYRS 
AGATHA COMES FROM AGIOS 
WHICH MEANS HOLY AND THEOS GOD 
HENCE SAINT OF GOD 
THE VIRGIN AGATHA WAS HIGH BORN AND A GREAT BEAUTY LIVING IN THE CITY 
OF CATANIA WHERE SHE WORSHIPPED GOD AT ALL TIMES AND IN ALL HOLINESS 
QUINTIANUS THE CONSULAR OFFICIAL IN SICILY WHO WAS BASE BORN LIBIDINOUS GREEDY 
AND A WORSHIPPER OF IDOLS WAS DETERMINED TO GET HER IN HIS GRASP 
AND BEING A PAGAN HE WOULD FORCE HER TO SACRIFICE TO THE GODS 
WHEN SHE REFUSED HE ORDERED HER STRETCHED ON THE RACK 
AND TORTURED AND AGATHA SAID THESE PAINS ARE MY DELIGHT 
THIS MADE QUINTIANUS SO ANGRY THAT HE ORDERED THE EXECUTIONERS TO TWIST 
HER BREAST FOR A LONG TIME AND THEN CUT IT OFF 
SAID AGATHA IMPIUS CRUEL AND BRUTAL TYRANT ARE YOU NOT ASHAMED 
TO CUT OFF FROM A WOMAN THAT WHICH YOUR MOTHER SUCKLED YOU WITH 
HE ORDERED AGATHA TO BE ROLLED NAKED OVER POTSHERDS AND LIVE COALS STREWN ON THE GROUND 
WHILST THIS WAS GOING ON A TREMENDOUS EARTHQUAKE SHOOK THE CITY AND CAUSED THE PALACE TO COLLAPSE 
AT THIS THE WHOLE POPULACE CAME RUNNING AND SHOUTING 
THAT SUCH THINGS WERE BEING VISITED ON THEM 
BECAUSE OF THE UNJUST TREATMENT BEING METED OUT TO AGATHA 
SO QUINTIANUS CAUGHT BETWEEN THE EARTHQUAKE AND THE POPULAR UPRISING 
ORDERED AGATHA BACK TO PRISON 
THERE SHE PRAYED SAYING LORD JESUS KEEP MY BODY FROM DEFILEMENT 
SHE CALLED OUT IN A LOUD VOICE AND GAVE UP HER SPIRIT 
ABOUT THE YEAR OF THE LORD TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THREE IN THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR DECIAN 
ONCE THE CONSTANTINE MADE CHRISTIANITY THE RELIGION OF THE REALM 
THERE WERE LESS AND LESS MARTYRDOMS AND PERSECUTIONS 
AND SO PEOPLE BEGAN TO ASK THE QUESTION 
HOW CAN WE FOLLOW CHRIST CLOSELY IN ORDER TO GET TO HEAVEN 
SO YOU HAVE THIS WHOLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DESERT SPIRITUALITY THE MONKS AND THE ASCETICS 
FOLLOWING CHRIST CLOSELY BY SEPARATING THEMSELVES FROM THE WORLD 
SO THEN WE BEGAN TO SEE THE DEVELOPMENT OF WHAT YOU MAY CALL A WHITE MARTYRDOM 
RED MARTYRDOM BEING THE GIVING OF ONE'S LIFE AS A MARTYR IN A VIOLENT DEATH 
AND A WHITE MARTYRDOM IS KIND OF LIKE DYING TO YOURSELF EACH AND EVERY DAY 
IN ORDER TO BE IN UNION WITH GOD WHICH IS THE GOAL OF OUR LIVES 
THAT OLD SELF THE EGO SELF HAS TO DIMINISH 
AND ULTIMATELY BE LEFT BEHIND 
I MEAN IF YOU TALK ABOUT GOING OUT TO THE DESERT 
THE ORIGINAL SUGGESTION WAS THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE BREAKING THE BONDS OF WHAT'S EXPECTED OF THEM 
WHY DID ANTHONY AND PAUL THE HERMIT GO TO THE DESERT 
THEY WENT OUT POSSIBLY BECAUSE THEY WERE IN DEBT THEY HAD TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL 
AND SAINT ANDREW ESCAPE FROM HIS FAN CLUB 
EXACTLY HIS FAN CLUB FOLLOWED HIM AND THEN HE HAD TO GO FURTHER INTO THE DESERT 
AND SAINT SIMON STYLITES GOT ONTO HIS PILLAR BECAUSE 
PEOPLE KEPT PLUCKING OFF HAIRS FROM HIM AND TAKING CLOTHING 
THIS IS ALL BEFORE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SAINTS AS A CULT 
WHICH IS A MUCH MORE SOCIOLOGICAL THING 
THAT'S ABOUT BISHOPS CONTROLLING 
WHO IS WORSHIPPED AND SAINT AUGUSTINE 
MUCH LATER A CENTURY LATER THAN SAINT ANTHONY 
AT LEAST WHEN HE STARTED 
IS VERY ANXIOUS ABOUT SAINTS 
THEY'RE NOT REALLY PART OF THE LANDSCAPE WHEN HE WAS A BISHOP 
DON'T YOU THINK THAT THIS SORT OF SELF MORTIFICATION 
THAT THEY WENT IN FOR AND THESE ORDEALS 
ARE KIND OF STANDING IN FOR THE BODILY SELF IMMOLATION 
MARTYRDOM WHICH IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE 
YES THE SORT OF SELF SACRIFICE 
AND ALL THAT IS PART OF SOMETHING 
THAT WAS CERTAINLY IMPORTANT TO SAINTS IN THE EARLY PERIODS 
BUT NO LONGER SO IMPORTANT 
AND THAT IS THIS IDEA OF THE RENUNCIATION ENTIRELY OF SEXUALITY OF RELATIONSHIP 
YOU KNOW YOU RENOUNCE YOUR CONNECTIONS TO FAMILY 
TO WELLBEING IN SOCIAL TERMS TO STATUS 
BUT BEYOND THAT VERY VERY SEVERE SELF PUNISHMENT 
THERE'S A COMPILATION OF THE SAINTS OF SYRIA 
BY A BISHOP CALLED THEODORET OF CYRUS 
AND IT IS LIKE A JOURNALIST COLLECTING SAUCY STORIES 
HE GOES AROUND THE HERMITAGES AND STYLITES 
AND FINDS A SAINT WHO'S IN A CAGE 
ANOTHER ONE WHO'S BURIED HIMSELF ALIVE 
ANOTHER WHO'S IMMOLATED HIMSELF IN A WALL AND YOU CAN SEE HIM COMING UP 
PULLING OUT THE PLUG IN THE WALL AND CHATTING WITH THIS GUY 
IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE SPECIAL IN YOUR LIFE WHO YOU LOVE 
YOU TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH OUT OF YOUR WALLET AND LOOK AT YOUR LOVED ONE 
IT COULD BE YOUR GRANDMOTHER SPOUSE WHATEVER 
IT REMINDS YOU OF THE RELATIONSHIP YOU HAVE WITH THEM 
THE SAINTS THAT ARE DEPICTED IN STATUES ICONS ARE REMINDERS 
AND THEY'RE JUST THERE AS YOUR FRIENDS TO HELP YOU THOSE WHO HAVE TROD THE PATH 
THAT YOU CAN IDENTIFY WITH AND EMULATE 
I REMEMBER ONE THING ABOUT SCHOOL WHICH WAS THAT WE HAD NO PERSONAL POSSESSIONS REALLY 
WE WERE ALLOWED TO EXCHANGE GIFTS ON HOLY DAYS ON FEAST DAYS 
AND THERE WAS HOLY SHOP AND WE WERE ALLOWED TO GO TO HOLY SHOP 
ON THESE SPECIAL FEAST DAYS AND WE BOUGHT HOLY PICTURES 
AND THE HOLY PICTURES VARIED BETWEEN RAPHAEL MADONNAS 
HIGH ART WHICH LOOKED A BIT SMULTZY AND KITSCH ACTUALLY IN THIS FORM 
AND LITTLE GERMAN PHOTOGRAPHS OF GERMAN PORCELAIN FIGURINES OF INCREDIBLE KITSCH 
AND THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TWO WE WERE JUST AS HAPPY TO HAVE 
LITTLE BABY JESUS AS A PORCELAIN FIGURINE 
AND COO OVER HIM AND LOVE HIM OR TO HAVE THESE BEAUTIFUL MADONNAS 
AND WE COLLECTED THEM 
YES I STILL HAVE THEM LITTLE HOLY PICTURES THEY WERE DONE VERY WELL DONE WITH SOME STYLE 
TO DEAR MARINA ON THE FEAST OF SAINT LUCY WITH LOVE FROM MOTHER BARBARA 
MOTHER BARBARA 
OH HOLY SAINT JUDE TO YOU I HAVE RECOURSE FROM THE DEPTH OF MY HEART AND HUMBLY BEG YOU 
LORD OUR GOD YOU GRACIOUSLY CHOSE 
OH ALMIGHTY GOD 
THE VERY FIRST FIGURATIVE IMAGES START THROUGH THE VENERATION OF THE SAINTS 
THE ICON IN A SENSE WAS A KIND OF ARTISTIC RELIC 
AND RECEIVED VENERATION IN THE SAME WAY AS SAINT'S BONES 
OR SAINT'S BLOOD OR MANNA FROM SAINT'S BODIES 
AND IT'S VERY CENTRAL TO THE EUROPEAN ARTISTIC TRADITION THAT THE FIRST PORTRAITS WERE THAT 
ONE THINKS OF PORTRAITS BEING NATURAL 
BUT THE FIRST PORTRAITS ARE ICONS OF SAINTS AND THE USE OF A. 
WHAT ABOUT THE IMAGES AT AL FAYYUM I'M NOT SURE 
I'M BEING PEDANTIC ABOUT THIS BUT THEY ARE NOT SAINTS THEY ARE NOT CHRISTIANS 
IT IS A VERY GOOD LINK BECAUSE THE FAYYUM WAX TECHNIQUE 
IS TRANSFERRED IN SAINT CATHERINE'S THE VERY EARLIEST IMAGES OF JESUS 
THE FACIAL PORTRAITS ARE IN CAUSTIC WAX 
AND SO YOU HAVE A DIRECT TRANSFERENCE OF THE PRE CHRISTIAN 
PORTRAIT TRADITION USED ON MUMMYS AGAIN CONNECTED WITH THE DEAD 
AND VENERATION AND REMEMBRANCE OF THE DEAD TO THE CHRISTIAN TRADITION OF PORTRAITURE 
THE IDEA THAT THE LIVING LIKENESS SOMEHOW REPELS DEATH 
THAT IF YOU CAN KEEP THE IMAGE THE LIVING SPEAKING LOOK OF THE PERSON 
AND IF ABOVE ALL IT CAN HAVE A CONNECTION TO THAT PERSON 
WHEN THEY WERE ALIVE LIKE SAINT LUKE PAINTING THE VIRGIN 
THE IDEA THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY PRESENT 
THAT SOMEHOW LIGHT FROM HER ACTUAL BEING KIND OF TRANSFERRED ITSELF 
OR IN THE CASE OF THE VERONICA THE ACTUAL LIKENESS OF CHRIST ON VERONICA'S VEIL 
OF COURSE ONE THING IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T RECOGNISE THEM ANY MORE 
WHEN I WENT TO FRANCE WITH A FRIEND OF MINE WHO WAS BROUGHT UP PROTESTANT 
IN FACT RATHER AGNOSTIC SHE WAS SORT OF NONPLUSSED 
SHE SAID WHO IS THAT PERSON WITH HER EYES ON STALKS HOLDING THEM OUT 
THIS LANGUAGE OF ATTRIBUTES 
THAT YOU RECOGNISE IMMEDIATELY WHAT THE STORIES ARE WHO THE PEOPLE ARE 
SAINT PETER MARTYR SAINT LUCY SAINT AGATHA 
THAT REALLY HAS BEEN UTTERLY LEACHED FROM THE CULTURE MY KIDS WOULD NOT 
BE ABLE TO RECOGNISE ANY OF THIS AT ALL 
WE'RE THE LAST GENERATION DOES IT MATTER 
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW EVEN TO IMAGINE 
WHAT OUR ART WOULD HAVE BEEN WITHOUT RELIGION 
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE 
WHAT WOULD THE PAINTERS HAVE PAINTED 
IN AN ATHEIST SOCIETY 
AND IT'S A HARD LIFE 
FOR A MAN WITH NO WIFE 
BABE IT'S A HARD LIFE 
GOD MAKES YOU LIVE 
BUT WITHOUT IT DON'T DOUBT IT 
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE 
YOUR TEARS TO GIVE 
FRANCIS SERVANT AND FRIEND OF THE ALMIGHTY 
WAS BORN IN THE CITY OF ASSISI 
HE BECAME A MERCHANT AND UNTIL HE WAS TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OLD 
LIVED A VAIN AND FRIVOLOUS LIFE 
THE LORD CHASTENED HIM WITH THE WHIP OF ILL HEALTH AND QUICKLY MADE 
A DIFFERENT MAN OF HIM AND HE EXHIBITED THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY 
ONCE HE AND A NUMBER OF COMPANIONS WERE CAPTURED BY THE PERUGIANS 
AND CONFINED IN A HORRID PRISON 
WHERE THE OTHERS BEMOANED THEIR FATE AND WHERE FRANCIS ALONE REJOICED 
KNOW THAT I REJOICE NOW BECAUSE IN TIME AT THE WHOLE WORLD WILL WORSHIP ME AS A SAINT 
ANOTHER TIME HE WENT TO ROME FOR REASONS OF DEVOTION 
HE PUT OFF HIS FINE CLOTHES AND DRESSED IN BEGGAR'S RAGS 
HE WOULD HAVE DONE THIS MORE OFTEN 
BUT WAS DISSUADED BECAUSE IT EMBARRASSED THOSE WHO KNEW HIM 
HIS FATHER HAD HIM BOUND AND HELD IN CUSTODY WHEREUPON HE GAVE 
ALL HIS MONEY TO HIS FATHER AND THE CLOTHES OFF HIS BACK 
THEN HE FLEW NAKED TO THE LORD AND PUT ON A HAIRSHIRT 
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO REMEMBER SOME WORDS OF SAINT FRANCIS OF ASSISI 
WHICH I THINK ARE REALLY JUST PARTICULARLY APT AT THE MOMENT 
IT COULD BE THAT SOME SAINTS ARE 
NOT COMPLETELY 
IN THE REFRAME OF OUR RATIONALITY 
WHERE THERE IS DISCORD MAY WE BRING HARMONY 
WHERE THERE IS ERROR MAY WE BRING TRUTH 
WHERE THERE IS DOUBT MAY WE BRING FAITH 
AND WHERE THERE IS DESPAIR MAY WE BRING HOPE 
IF YOU ANALYSE THE SAINTS THEY WOULD NOT NECESSARILY 
COME OUT IN THAT SORT OF GREAT LEVEL OF HUMAN MATURITY 
SO GOD WOULD USE FLAWED MATERIAL 
WE WOULD SAY 
WHEN HIS FATHER CAME AND SAID DON'T DO THIS PLEASE DON'T BECOME 
THIS MONK OR WHATEVER THIS FRIAR 
HE SAID I REJECT ALL 
JUST LIKE A HIPPY OR SOMETHING 
I REJECT ALL TO DO WITH YOU YOU HORRIBLE BOSS YOU HORRIBLE RICH MAN 
ONE OF THE SAINTS THAT I HAVE BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN IS SAINT DYMPHNA 
WHO IS INDEED AN IRISH SAINT SHE IS THE PATRON SAINT OF INSANITY 
AND HER STORY REALLY DOESN'T BRING IN MUCH OF CHRISTIANITY 
NOR INDEED MUCH OF EXEMPLARY LIFE 
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT SHE FINDS HERSELF LOSING HER MOTHER 
AND AS IN A FAIRY TALE HER MOTHER STIPULATES ON HER DEATHBED 
THAT HER FATHER SHOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN 
SO HE WEEPS HE MOURNS AND THEN SHE GROWS UP 
AND COURTIERS ARE VERY KEEN THAT THE KING SHOULD REMARRY 
BECAUSE THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE KINGDOM'S SECURITY 
THEY WANT AN HEIR AND OF COURSE HE NOTICES THAT 
THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD THAT LOOKS IN THE LEAST BIT LIKE 
HIS DEAD WIFE IS HIS DAUGHTER SO HE ASKS HER TO MARRY HIM 
AND SHE FLEES 
SHE FLEES 
AND SHE TAKES THE COURT JESTER WITH HER 
SHE DISGUISES HERSELF AS A JESTER IN MALE CLOTHES THERE'S SOME LOVELY TOUCHES 
AND THEY END UP IN THE TOWN OF GHEEL 
THAT'S RIGHT SPELT G. HEEL GHEEL I THINK IT'S CALLED 
IN FLANDERS IN FLANDERS WHICH IS NOW THE HOME OF A LARGE ASYLUM 
THE TOWN OF GHEEL IS AN OPEN ASYLUM AND HAS BEEN SINCE THE MIDDLE AGES 
ON ACCOUNT OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MADNESS OF HER FATHER 
THIS IS THE WAY THAT SAINT'S SUFFERINGS BECOME TRANSFERRED TO THEIR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE 
IF A SAINT HAS SUFFERED FROM TOOTHACHE 
SHE BECOMES THE PATRON SAINT OF DENTISTRY 
IF A SAINT HAS SUFFERED INCEST OR THREATENED INCEST FROM HER FATHER 
SHE BECOMES THE PATRON SAINT OF INSANITY 
I RECALL A LONG TIME AGO 
ON THE FALLS ROAD THIS OLD MAN WHO USED TO STAND ON THE CORNER 
OF THE STREET AND HE WAS UNSHAVEN HIS EYES WERE RED 
HE HAD LONG HAIR AND THE STORY WAS 
ACH SURE HE'S ALL RIGHT HE'S NOT ALL THERE 
AND FOR SOME KIND OF STRANGE REASON HE WAS SEEN AS 
SOMEBODY WHO WAS STRANGE AND ECCENTRIC WHO WASN'T ALL THERE 
BUT WHO YOU WERE IN SOME KIND OF AWE OF 
WAS HE CONSIDERED TO BE TOUCHED BY THE DIVINE YEAH HE WAS INDEED 
THEN BLESSED ANDREW SETTLED IN ACHAEA 
FILLED THE WHOLE REGION WITH CHURCHES 
AND LED A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO THE CHRISTIAN FAITH 
AMONG OTHERS HE CONVERTED THE WIFE OF THE PROCONSUL AGIUS AND BAPTISED HER 
AS SOON AS THE PROCONSUL HEARD OF THIS HE CAME TO THE TOWN OF PATRAS 
AND COMMANDED THE CHRISTIANS TO SACRIFICE TO THE IDOLS 
SAYING TO ANDREW IF YOU REFUSE TO OBEY ME 
I SHALL HAVE YOU HUNG UP ON THE CROSS YOU BOAST ABOUT 
AND HE THREATENED HIM WITH OTHER TORMENTS 
HE RESPONDED MAKE THEM THE WORST YOU CAN THINK OF 
THE MORE BRAVELY I BEAR SUFFERING IN HIS NAME THE MORE ACCEPTABLE I SHALL BE TO MY KING 
AGIUS COMMANDED TWENTY ONE MEN TO SEIZE HIM FLOG HIM 
AND BIND HIM HAND AND FOOT TO A CROSS TO MAKE HIS AGONY LAST ALL THE LONGER 
WHILE THE SAINT WAS BEING LED TO THE CROSS 
A GREAT CROWD GATHERED SHOUTING 
AN INNOCENT MAN IS BEING CONDEMNED TO SHED HIS BLOOD WITHOUT CAUSE 
THE APOSTLE HOWEVER BEGGED THEM NOT TO TRY TO SAVE HIM FROM HIS MARTYRDOM 
THEN SEEING THE CROSS IN THE DISTANCE HE SAID HAIL O. CROSS 
SACRIFICED BY THE BODY OF CHRIST AND ADORNED WITH ALL HIS LIMBS 
AS WITH PRECIOUS STONES BEFORE THE LORD WAS LIFTED UP ON YOU 
YOU WERE GREATLY FEARED ON EARTH BUT NOW YOU DRAW DOWN LOVE FROM HEAVEN 
O. GOOD CROSS HONOURED AND BEAUTIFIED BY THE LIMBS OF THE LORD 
HAVING SAID THESE WORDS HE SHED HIS GARMENTS 
AND GAVE THEM TO THE EXECUTIONERS WHO FIXED HIM TO THE CROSS 
FOR TWO DAYS ANDREW HUNG ALIVE AND PREACHED TO TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
AS ANDREW FINISHED HIS PRAYER A DAZZLING LIGHT SHONE FROM HEAVEN 
AND ENVELOPED HIM FOR THE SPACE OF HALF AN HOUR HIDING HIM FROM SIGHT 
AND AS THE LIGHT FADED HE BREATHED HIS LAST 
CANONISATION WAS A TRIAL USED TO BE A TRIAL 
HOW MANY PEOPLE INVOLVED 
WELL YOU WOULD HAVE THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED ON ONE SIDE BY THE POSTULATOR OF THE CAUSE 
AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE ON THE OTHER SIDE ARGUING THE OPPOSITE CASE 
AND THEN THERE WOULD BE A TRIBUNAL SIT LISTENING TO THIS EVIDENCE 
AND THEY WOULD TAKE A VOTE EXACTLY 
THE WHOLE PROCESS OR THE GOAL OF THE PROCESS OF CANONISATION IS NOT TO CANONISE 
IT'S TO GET AT THE TRUTH 
IN THE ORTHODOX CHURCH THERE IS 
I SUPPOSE THIS IS WHY WE TEND TO TALK ABOUT SAINTS 
BECAUSE THEY ARE EITHER WESTERN OR EASTERN 
BUT IN BOTH CHURCHES EAST AND WEST THERE IS A STRUCTURE FOR PRODUCING SAINTS 
THERE ISN'T IN THE ANGLICAN CHURCH OR IN THE PROTESTANT CHURCH 
ALL THE DIFFERENCE SECTS THAT YOU SEE 
ALL THE DIFFERENT EVANGELICAL MOVEMENTS ALL INVOKE 
CHRIST AS THE INTERCESSOR HE IS THE ONLY LEGITIMATE UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES 
HE WILL BE THE SAVIOUR HE WILL BE THE REDEEMER OR HE WILL HAVE MANY IMAGINATIVE NAMES TOO 
THERE WILL NEVER BE A HUMAN 
WE WANT SOMEBODY ON OUR BEHALF 
THAT'S WHAT SAINTS ARE ABOUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT'S EXACTLY IT 
THEY ARE OUR LINK BETWEEN THIS WORLD AND THE NEXT 
YOU CAN'T ASK GOD FOR YOUR CREDIT CARDS IT'S A BIT TOO MUCH 
I AM WORKING IN THE CONGREGATION OF SAINTS AS A POSTULATOR 
I AM RESPONSIBLE OF FIFTEEN CAUSES 
JUST TO TELL YOU ABOUT ONE CAUSE VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME 
IS THE CAUSE OF MOTHER MARIANNE COPE 
THIRTY YEARS AGO I STARTED THAT CAUSE BECAUSE MOTHER MARIANNE COPE 
LIVED THIRTY FIVE YEARS IN MOLOKAI IN THE ISLAND OF LEPROSY 
WHERE FATHER DAMIEN AS WELL SPENT HIS LIFE AS A MISSIONARY 
SO IT WAS A GREAT SATISFACTION WHEN LAST MAY 
THE POPE DECLARED MOTHER MARIANNE COPE BEATUS BLESSED 
SCRIPTURE SAYS THAT ONLY GOD KNOWS THE HEARTS OF MEN AND WOMEN 
AND THAT IS VERY TRUE WE ALL ACT OUT OF MIXED EMOTIONS FOR MIXED MOTIVES 
AND SO WHEN WE SEE SOMEONE WHO DIES THE DEATH OF A MARTYR 
OR IF WE SEE SOMEONE WHO LIVES A LIFE OF VIRTUE 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IN THEIR HEARTS WHAT IS REALLY AND TRULY MOTIVATING THEM ONLY GOD KNOWS 
SO GOD CONFIRMS THAT HUMAN JUDGMENT 
GOD CONFIRMS THAT THE PERSON IS TRULY IN HEAVEN 
BY GRANTING MIRACLES GRACES AND FAVOURS THROUGH THAT PERSON'S INTERCESSION 
FOR THE BEATIFICATION SHE WAS CURING A GIRL A UNIVERSITY STUDENT 
FROM CANCER 
THIS IDEA THAT AN ILLNESS IS REVERSED AND THEN YOU HUNT AROUND FOR SORT OF 
LOTS OF DOCTORS WHO WILL CERTIFY THAT THIS COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE HAPPENED I MEAN COME ON 
DON'T LOOK AT ME I'M NOT GONNA DEFEND IT NO NO 
BUT ACTUALLY I HAVE A HIGHER REGARD FOR THEOLOGY THAN THIS 
I DO THINK THIS IS THE MOST REDUCTIVE POSSIBLE WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THE MIRACULOUS 
I MEAN IT'S JUST THE PLACE WHERE SCIENCE CANNOT FIND THE ANSWER 
COME ON I'M NOT GOING TO DEFEND THIS 
SO DON'T SAY COME ON TO ME 
BUT I'M JUST TELLING YOU THAT'S THE WAY IT IS 
ACCORDING TO THE PROCEDURE AFTER THE CHURCH HAS DECLARED A PERSON BLESSED 
THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER MIRACLE 
AFTER THE BEATIFICATION AFTER ROME HAS RECOGNISED 
THAT THIS MIRACLE HAS BEEN DONE 
BY THE INTERCESSION OF MADAM MARIANNE COPE 
THEN SHE'LL BECOME A SAINT 
BUT SAINT ONLY MEANS HOLY 
I MEAN THEY ARE HOLY PEOPLE BUT MOST OF THEM 
I MEAN I CALCULATED ONCE AND I THINK THERE ARE ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND SAINTS IN ANY MARTYROLOGY 
ANY LIST OF ROMAN CATHOLIC SAINTS WESTERN SAINTS 
OF THOSE I THINK TEN THOUSAND ARE NOT CANONISED 
THE WHOLE IDEA OF ATTEMPTING TO CONTROL IT 
THROWS UP HUGE PROBLEMS DOESN'T IT 
IN ONE SENSE WHERE OFFICIALDOM GOES YOU GET A DIMINUTION OF SANCTITY 
IN THE HISTORY OF CANONISATION WHAT WE SAW IS A TWO PRONGED DEVELOPMENT AT THE SAME TIME THEOLOGICALLY 
THE FIRST ONE WAS THAT SAINTS ARE UNIVERSAL FIGURES AND NOT JUST FIGURES OF THE LOCAL CHURCH 
AND THE SECOND ONE THE SECOND THEOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT WAS THAT 
ONLY THE ROMAN PONTIFF THE HOLY FATHER HAS UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION 
SO SINCE YOU HAVE A SAINT AS BEING A UNIVERSAL FIGURE AND THE ROMAN PONTIFF OR THE HOLY FATHER 
AS HAVING A LONE UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION THEN ONLY THE POPE CAN CANONISE 
SO GRADUALLY AS TIME WENT ON AND THIS THEOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT BEGAN TO TAKE HOLD 
THEN THE PROCESS WAS MORE AND MORE CONCENTRATED IN ROME BUT PRIOR TO THAT IT WAS NOT 
IT WAS A LOCAL PROCESS THAT BEGAN AMONG THE LOCAL PEOPLE WITH THE LEADER OF THE LOCAL CHURCH 
IN OTHER WORDS THIS IDEA OF PUBLIC ACCLAMATION WAS AND STILL IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE PROCESS 
PRACTICALLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS DEATH ALL THE POPULATION OF ROME CAME TO HONOUR HIS BODY 
IT WAS SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR TO THE SITUATION THAT WE LIVE HERE AND NOW IN THE PROCESS OF JOHN PAUL THE SECOND 
ALL THE POPULATION OF ROME WENT TO GRIEVE CONVINCED THAT HE WAS SENT 
ONE OF THE CENTRAL ISSUES IN ISLAM TODAY 
IS WHETHER IT'S LEGITIMATE OR NOT IN THE SAME WAY 
THAT IT WAS A CENTRAL ISSUE IN EUROPE IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
IS IT LEGITIMATE TO GO TO GOD THROUGH A SAINT 
AND FOR CENTURIES MOST MUSLIMS HAVE LIVED POPULAR ISLAM WHICH IS THROUGH THE SAINTS 
AND SO YOU HAVE A SAINT SHRINE LIKE NIZAMUDDIN IN DELHI WHICH IS WHERE I LIVE FOR MOST OF THE YEAR 
AND ON THURSDAY NIGHTS EVERYONE GATHERS CHRISTIANS HINDUS SIKHS ALL COME 
THEY VENERATE THE SAINT 
NOW IF YOU'RE A WAHHABI MUSLIM FROM SAUDI ARABIA THIS IS ABSOLUTE HERESY 
YES AND THESE ARE REAL LIVE ISSUES 
IF YOU GO TO SOMEWHERE LIKE PESHAWAR IN THE NORTH WEST FRONTIER 
YOU FIND THERE ARE SAUDI FUNDED MADRASSAS WHICH HAVE SPRUNG UP 
PRODUCED THIS VERY LIKE REFORMIST PROTESTANT CHRISTIANITY 
ABSOLUTELY AND PEOPLE COME AND THEY BREAK THE SAINT'S SHRINES 
AND ATTACK THE MUSICIANS WHO ARE SINGING THERE 
AND THEY SAY THIS IS NOT RIGHT THIS IS NOT WHAT ISLAM IS 
AND WHAT THE REFORMATION WAS 
THE ISSUES OF WHETHER THE RELICS OF SAINT ANDREW'S BEING ATTACKED BY JOHN KNOX 
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LIVE AND PRESENT AND CRUCIAL TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD TODAY 
AND THE WHOLE QUESTION OF THE DIFFERENT SORTS OF ISLAM 
AND WHETHER ONE HAS THE TOLERANT PLURALISTIC SUFI ISLAM WHICH IS MORE OR LESS 
THE SAME AS SORT OF A POPULAR CHRISTIANITY AND THE ADORATION OF SAINTS IN REFORMATION ENGLAND 
ONE THING THAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST WAS THAT THERE WAS A SENSE OF AN IMAGINARY WORLD OF POSSIBILITIES 
AND THESE WERE MET BY A SERIES OF STORIES 
LIKE MYTHS THERE ARE JUST SO MANY 
IT'S THE WHOLE OF THE GOLDEN LEGEND ACTUALLY IN THE GOLDEN LEGEND THE BEHAVIOUR OF 
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A NUN 
THE VIRGIN MARINA WAS HER FATHER'S ONLY CHILD 
WHEN HE WAS WIDOWED AND ENTERED A MONASTERY 
HE CHANGED HIS DAUGHTER'S ATTIRE AND DRESSED HER AS A MALE 
HE THEN ASKED THE ABBOT AND THE MONKS TO ADMIT HIS ONLY SON 
AND WHEN THEY AGREED 
MARINA WAS ADMITTED AS MONK 
AND WAS CALLED BROTHER MARINUS BY ALL 
MARINUS THEN BEGAN TO LIVE THE RELIGIOUS LIFE AND TO OBSERVE STRICT OBEDIENCE 
WHEN THE FATHER FELT THE APPROACH OF DEATH HE CALLED HIS DAUGHTER 
ENCOURAGED HER TO REMAIN FIRM IN HER RESOLUTION AND NEVER TO REVEAL THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN 
AT LENGTH HAVING LED A LIFE FILLED WITH GOOD WORKS MARINUS MIGRATED TO THE LORD 
WHEN IT CAME TIME TO BATHE THE CORPSE 
BEFORE BURYING IT IN SOME GRUBBY CORNER THE MONKS SAW THAT IT WAS A WOMAN 
THEY WERE STUPEFIED AND FRIGHTENED AND ADMITTED THEY'D GROSSLY MALTREATED THIS HANDMAID OF GOD 
THEY THEREFORE GAVE HER HONOURABLE BURIAL IN THE CHURCH 
SOMETIMES YOU CAN EVEN FEEL STORIES PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE 
THE SPIRIT IS DIFFERENT THAN IN NORMAL CHURCHES IN CITIES 
I FEEL IN A SECULAR SPIRIT I FEEL THERE WAS A LOSS OF IMAGINATIVE RICHNESS WHEN THE REFORMATION 
CAME AND WANTED ALL THESE THINGS TO BE TRUE IN A POSITIVIST WAY 
I DON'T NEED A SAINT I DON'T NEED ANY OTHER SORT OF GOD 
OR ANY OTHER IMAGE TO TAKE OUT MY BAD ENERGY 
IT'S JUST MYSELF AND 
LIKE WALKING GOING UP BIG MOUNTAINS 
YOU CAN'T REACH UP TO THE TOP AND YOU'RE JUST TAKING ALL THE BAD STUFF OUT OF YOU 
THE CATHOLIC MARTYROLOGY AND HAGIOGRAPHY 
CONTAIN AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF INTERESTING STORIES 
THEY WERE CHASED OUT AS BEING FOOLISH AND SUPERSTITIOUS 
AND FOR THE COMMON PEOPLE AND WE WERE TOO SOPHISTICATED TO HAVE THEM 
BUT THEY'RE NOT LIKE THAT THEY REALLY ARE FULL OF HUMAN RICHNESS 
I THINK THERE IS A PROBLEM THERE 
THERE IS POPULAR RELIGION AND WHEN YOU SEE IT IN LATIN AMERICA IT REALLY IS VIBRANT 
IT DOESN'T EXIST IN WESTERN EUROPE 
I MEAN IT MIGHT DO IN SPAIN 
THEY HAVE THE GOOD THIEF THEY HAVE A CULT OF THE GOOD THIEF WHAT A GOOD IDEA 
LET'S HAVE REPENTANT THIEVES GIVEN THEIR DUE 
I THINK THAT IS PARTLY THE PROBLEM OF TALKING ABOUT SAINTS IN ONE SENSE 
AT THE END OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY THE PEOPLE THAT WROTE THE LIVES OF SAINTS 
THE ACADEMIC LIVES OF SAINTS THE SCIENTIFIC LIVES OF SAINTS 
THEY ONLY TOOK PEOPLE WHO THEY THOUGHT AS YOU RIGHTLY SAY THEY THOUGHT HAD A HISTORY 
THEY WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE TRUE WHO WERE REAL 
THEY GET INTO THE CALENDAR MOST OF THE SAINTS WERE NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL 
WERE LEGENDS WERE LEGENDS 
A CERTAIN WOMAN OF SUFFOLK CAME TO READING WITH HER DAUGHTER 
NATURE HAD SO CONDEMNED THIS GIRL FROM BIRTH THAT FROM HER KNEES DOWN 
SHE APPEARED TO HAVE NO FIRM BONES IN HER SHINS 
AND COULD NOT BEND OR STRAIGHTEN HER KNEES 
WHEN THE GIRL SAW IN PROCESSION THE RELIQUARY 
IN WHICH THE HAND OF THE BLESSED SAINT JAMES WAS KEPT 
SHE FELT THE AID OF DIVINE POWER 
AND THE ASSISTANCE OF THE APOSTLE'S PRESENCE 
IN FACT HER SHINS IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO HARDEN AND TO GAIN STRENGTH AS FIRM BONES 
AS THEY DID SO HER FEET AND THE SOLES OF HER FEET INSTANTLY HARDENED WITH THE RESULT THAT 
IN A SHORT WHILE SHE WAS VERY FULLY RESTORED TO HEALTH AND ACQUIRED THE POWER OF WALKING 
THE HAND OF SAINT JAMES AT READING WAS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT RELIC OF A SAINT 
WHAT YOU DID AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT AT THAT TIME YOU WENT OUT 
YOU HIRED THESE GUYS TO GO OUT AND SEE 
IF THE RELIC OF SAINT WHOEVER IT WAS FROM WHEREVER IT WAS 
IN THE SMALL HOURS ONE OF THESE GUYS WOULD GO 
AND WOULD COME BACK WITH AN EXACT THING 
OF THE RELICS AND THE BONES OF WHOEVER 
THE PARDONER'S TALE 
THE WHOLE THING ABOUT THE ICONS AND THE BONES AND THE RELICS OF THE SAINTS 
WERE EXCHANGED YOU KNOW 
YOU'VE GOT THE STUFF THEY'VE GOT THE STUFF 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE FINGER OF SAINT JAMES 
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT FOR THAT 
I'VE GOT A THUMB OF SAINT PAUL HERE YOU KNOW 
IN MOST CASES THE HAND WAS BROUGHT INTO USE AS IT WERE THROUGH WHAT WAS CALLED WATER OF SAINT JAMES 
THAT IS TO SAY WATER IN WHICH THE HAND OR THE RELIC WE ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE HAD BEEN DIPPED 
THIS WATER WAS THEN EITHER DRUNK 
HE'S GOING TO TASTE IT HE'S GOING TO DRINK IT 
THE DRINKING OF THE WATER OF SAINT JAMES WAS AN IMPORTANT WAY 
OF EFFECTING THE CURE PARTICULARLY FOR INTERNAL PROBLEMS 
WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE 
I CAN'T SAY IT'S MANNA FOR THE BODY 
IT'S MANNA FROM THE SHRINE OF SAINT NICHOLAS IN BARI WHICH IS MY MOTHER'S HOME TOWN 
IS THERE A SPRING THAT RUNS THROUGH IT IT COMES OUT OF THE TOMB 
IT COMES OUT OF THE TOMB IT'S THE SWEAT THE MANNA THEY CALL IT 
MANNA LIKE IN THE DESERT 
SAINT NICHOLAS IS SANTA CLAUS 
IT'S THE WRONG TIME OF YEAR 
I NEVER FELT INSIDE MYSELF THE NEED TO BELIEVE 
I FEEL THE NEED TO KNOW 
WHICH IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT 
IN THE CASE OF SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA 
THERE IS THE TOMB OF SAINT JAMES OF SANTIAGO 
WHICH IS THE GODFATHER OF SPAIN 
BUT APPARENTLY THE GRAVE IS EMPTY 
A LONG TIME AGO THE BODY IF EVER THERE WAS A BODY HAS BEEN STOLEN 
THAT ALSO IS QUITE INTERESTING TO WALK TOWARDS AN EMPTY GRAVE 
DO YOU FEEL THE SAME ABOUT SANTIAGO 
DID YOU WANT TO GO BACK 
NO I DIDN'T WANT TO GO BACK 
I QUITE ENJOYED IT 
IT WAS JUST BEFORE MY MARRIAGE IT WAS A CLEANSING THINKING THING 
BEFORE ACTUALLY GOING ON TO THE ALTAR AND MAKING THE VOWS 
I REMEMBER 
WITH ONE PART OF THE TRIP I WAS WITH TWO PANEL BEATERS FROM FIAT IN MILAN 
THEY WERE THESE BIG GUYS 
THEY HAD THESE HUGE RUCKSACKS 
THEY WERE SERIOUS ITALIAN PEASANTS AND I WAS TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THOSE GUYS 
AND I LOVED IT BUT I WOULDN'T GO BACK IT'S TOUGH 
I KNOW THE IDEA IF YOU DO GO ON ONE OF THESE THINGS 
WHAT YOU MIGHT DO EVERY STEP OF THE WAY 
YOU THROW YOURSELF DOWN ON THE ROAD GET UP AGAIN 
YOU GO EVERY STEP OF THE ROAD 
COMPOSTELA 
NO IF YOU ARE GOING THE WHOLE HOG 
YOU WALK ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES 
I REMEMBER THERE WAS A CHARACTER IN RUNCIMAN'S CRUSADES WHO MURDERED SOMEBODY 
IN PENANCE HE WENT FROM ANTIOCH WHICH IS NOW IN TURKEY 
TO JERUSALEM WHICH IS NOW IN ISRAEL WHICH IS A DISTANCE OF FIVE HUNDRED MILES 
FIVE HUNDRED MILES ON YOUR KNEES 
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR A DIRECTOR TO MAKE MIRACLES 
THE MIRACLES HAVE TO BE FAKE WHEN YOU MAKE A FILM ABOUT A SAINT 
BUT ONCE A MIRACLE HAPPENED IN A FILM IN THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC 
BY DREYER 
IN THE PAST THE OFFICIAL PAINTERS 
MAKING THE PORTRAIT OF THE GRANDEE 
WOULD PUT A FLY SOMEWHERE ON THE PAINTING WOULD PAINT THE FLY 
THE FLY MEANING DEATH 
THE FLY CARRIES THE WORMS WHICH ARE GOING TO EAT THAT DUKE OR PRINCE OR KING 
THAT'S A SYMBOL OF DEATH 
NOW IN JOAN OF ARC AT ONE POINT 
WHEN JOAN IS TOLD SHE'S GOING TO BE KILLED TO BE BURNT 
A FLY COMES AND GOES TO HER CHEEK LIKE THIS 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE BECAUSE OF COURSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DO IT'S A REAL FLY 
AND FALCONETTI THE ACTRESS IS SO MUCH INVOLVED IN HER ACTING THAT SHE JUST GOES LIKE THIS AND CONTINUES 
WITHOUT LOSING HER CONCENTRATION FOR ONE SECOND 
TO MY KNOWLEDGE IT'S THE ONLY MIRACLE IN THE HISTORY OF THE MOVIES 
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SAINTS AND HOW SAINTS CAME TO BE 
IT WAS IN THE CHRISTIAN TRADITION 
SAINTS CAME TO BE IN A WORLD IN WHICH PEOPLE WERE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR SALVATION 
WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE NOT 
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SAINTS WHO WERE ACTUALLY HERETICS 
THERE'S MORE OF THEM THAN YOU'D THINK 
LIKE FOR INSTANCE SAINT AUGUSTINE WAS A REAL HERETIC 
BUT HE CONVERTED AND HE WENT TO THE RIGHT AND TRUE RELIGION 
AND THEN HE BECAME A PROSECUTOR OF HERETICS 
AND SENT THEM TO THE FLAMES WITHOUT ANY PITY 
THAT'S WHY I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW 
THE STORY OF HERESIES LIKE BEING THE CRADLE OF FANATICISM 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE IT IS BORN 
WHEN I WANT TO DEFEND AT ANY PRICE MY TRUTH 
I ACCEPT THE DOGMA OF THIS RELIGION 
ALMOST ENTIRELY EXCEPT FOR ONE POINT 
THAT POINT IN THE DOGMA I DON'T ACCEPT 
I HAVE TO I'M OBLIGED TO CHANGE AND TO DECIDE THAT THAT'S NOT THE TRUTH 
THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT POINT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT IT IS 
AND THIS LITTLE PIECE OF TRUTH IS MINE 
AND FOR THAT LITTLE BIT OF TRUTH I'M READY TO KILL OR TO DIE 
OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME SAINTS CREATED BY THE PERSECUTORS WITHIN THE CHURCH 
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE FIGURES LIKE JOAN OF ARC JOAN OF ARC WAS BURNED BY THE CHURCH 
SHE'S NOW A SAINT OF THE CHURCH 
SHE WAS TRIED BY THE INQUISITION FOUND TO BE A HERETIC AND BURNED WHAT WAS HER HERESY 
HAVING DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH GOD YES 
SEVERAL OTHER THINGS TOO I DO THINK WE DO 
SHE'S ONE OF THE FEW ROMAN CATHOLIC 
SAINTS WHO WAS ACTUALLY BURNED FOR HERESY EXACTLY 
SHE'S AN INTERESTING CHARACTER SHE IS 
SHE WAS CLEARLY MADE A SAINT PARTICULARLY JOAN OF ARC 
BECAUSE THE VATICAN WAS TRYING TO DO A DEAL WITH THE FRENCH STATE 
THE POLITICS OF CANONISATION IS A WHOLE STORY IN ITSELF 
THE CHURCH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY ONCE BETRAYED AND BURNT JOAN OF ARC AS A HERETIC 
SHE IS NOW HONOURED BY THEM AS THE SYMBOL OF FRENCH PATRIOTISM 
DURING THE CRUSADES WHEN THE CHRISTIANS 
WERE ON THEIR WAY TO BESIEGE JERUSALEM 
A VERY BEAUTIFUL YOUNG MAN APPEARED TO A CERTAIN PRIEST 
HE TOLD THE PRIEST THAT HE WAS SAINT GEORGE 
THE CAPTAIN OF THE CHRISTIAN HOST 
AND THAT IF THE CRUSADE HAS CARRIED HIS RELICS TO JERUSALEM 
HE WOULD BE WITH THEM 
THEN WHEN THEY HAD LAID SIEGE TO THE CITY 
THEY DIDN'T DARE MOUNT THE SCALING LADDERS IN THE FACE OF THE SARACENS' RESISTANCE 
BUT SAINT GEORGE APPEARED TO THEM WEARING WHITE ARMOUR MARKED WITH A RED CROSS 
AND MADE THEM UNDERSTAND THEY COULD FOLLOW HIM UP THE WALLS IN SAFETY 
AND THAT THE CITY WOULD BE THEIRS 
THUS REASSURED THE ARMY TOOK THE CITY AND SLAUGHTERED THE SARACENS 
SAINTS ARE ALWAYS SEEN AS MILITARY HEROES 
THE BEAUTIFUL MAN ON THE HORSE THAT YOU SEE IN THE GREEK ICONS 
AND IN EASTERN SAINTS THERE ARE A LOT MORE MILITARY SAINTS 
WE HAVE SAINT GEORGE AND SAINT MICHAEL 
THERE'S HUGE NUMBERS OF SAINTS ON HORSEBACK CARRYING LANCES AND SWORDS AND SPEARS 
GOING BACK TO SAINT JAMES OF COMPOSTELA THIS IDEA OF A SAINT NOT NECESSARILY BEING GOOD 
WITH SAINT JAMES ONE HAD THIS IDEA OF MATAMOROS THE MOOR KILLER 
YOU STILL HAVE CENTRAL TO SPAIN'S IDEOLOGY 
THE PATRON SAINT IS SOMEBODY WHO KILLS SOMEBODY OF ANOTHER FAITH 
WE'RE USED TO THINKING OF NAZISM AS BEING UNIQUE IN WIPING OUT ANOTHER RELIGIOUS FAITH IN EUROPE 
BUT SAINT JAMES' WHOLE REASON 
AS REMEMBERED IN SPANISH MYTH IS THAT HE'S THE MOOR KILLER 
AND ABOVE EVERY PARADOR ON THE WAY TO COMPOSTELA 
YOU HAVE THESE IMAGES OF SAINT JAMES ON HIS HORSE KILLING AND BEHEADING PEOPLE WITH TURBANS ON 
I THINK THAT'S A BIT UNFAIR IN A SENSE 
BECAUSE ISLAM HAD CONQUERED SPAIN AND IT WAS ALL THE BUSINESS ABOUT 
YES BUT IF YOU HAVE A SAINT WHOSE ENTIRE RAISON D'ETRE IS KILLING ANOTHER FAITH 
IT'S NOT GOODNESS IN THE SENSE THAT WE THINK OF SAINTS AS BEING GOOD TODAY 
I THINK THAT'S BEEN A BIT MODERN 
MASS MURDERING SOMEBODY FROM ANOTHER FAITH IS NOT GOODNESS 
MURDER IS MURDER 
KILLING IS KILLING 
TODAY WE CONSIDER THE CHRISTIANS HAVE SOFTENED 
THEY TEACH YOU ABOUT TRUTH AND THEY'RE MUCH LESS FANATICAL THAN THEY USED TO BE IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
EVEN IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THEY WERE QUITE CRUEL 
CHRISTIANS HAD A RIGHT TO KILL THE UNFAITHFUL 
EXACTLY LIKE TODAY SOME OF THE RADICAL ISLAMISTS GIVE THEMSELVES THE RIGHT 
NOT ONLY THE RIGHT THE DUTY TO KILL THE UNFAITHFUL 
YOU KNOW THE NON ISLAMICS 
THERE ARE TWO THEMES AREN'T THERE ABOUT THE MARTYR 
ONE IS SELF SACRIFICE FOR A GREATER CAUSE AND THE OTHER 
IS THAT SOMEHOW YOU PUT YOURSELF AS AN INDIVIDUAL ON THE LINE 
SO IT'S KIND OF YOU IN RELATION TO A LARGER ISSUE 
BUT OF COURSE THE SUICIDE BOMBER OF OUR ERA HAS TWO MAJOR DISTINCTIONS 
ONE IS THAT THE SUICIDE BOMBER IS AN EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE WEAPON 
IN HIMSELF OR HERSELF AND IS USED PRECISELY AS A WEAPON 
THEY ARE DETONATED AS WEAPONS 
SO THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT 
BECAUSE IT'S A PHYSICAL WEAPON AS OPPOSED TO SIMPLY A STATEMENT 
IT ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT 
IF YOU WANT TO BE A SUICIDE BOMBER 
YOU'RE GOING TO ASPIRE TO BE A SUICIDE BOMBER 
I KNOW A BIT ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THERE'S SOME 
YOU CAN BE VERY EASILY 
I COULD HAVE BEEN EASILY LED TO SAY 
IF YOU PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE IT WILL BE FOR THIS 
IT'S GONNA BE A GOOD THING IT'S GONNA BE O. K. YOU KNOW 
WE MUST NEVER FORGET THAT WHAT WE ARE MAD ABOUT TODAY 
YOU KNOW WHEN WE SEE PEOPLE KILLING BLINDLY IN LONDON 
IN MADRID YOU KNOW INNOCENT PEOPLE WE HAVE DONE IT IN THE PAST 
NO DOUBT THE CRUSADES AND MANY OTHER WARS 
WERE LED ONLY TO KILL PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T SHARE OUR BELIEFS 
WE MUST NEVER FORGET THAT ON ONE SIDE OF THE BARBED WIRE 
YOU HAVE A HERO AND ON THE OTHER SIDE A CRIMINAL 
YOU LOOK LIKE AN ANGEL 
LOOK LIKE AN ANGEL 
WALK LIKE AN ANGEL 
WALK LIKE AN ANGEL 
TALK LIKE AN ANGEL 
BUT I GOT WISE 
YOU'RE THE DEVIL IN DISGUISE 
OH YES YOU ARE 
DEVIL IN DISGUISE 
OH YEAH YOU ARE 
DEVIL IN DISGUISE 
OH YES YOU ARE 
DEVIL IN DISGUISE 
IF YOU WANT TO RAISE MONEY FOR CHARITY 
IF YOU COULD GET A PAIR OF BECKS' JEANS TO AUCTION 
I MEAN CHARITIES DO TRY AND DO THAT THEY TRY TO GET 
THE CLOTHING OF THESE PEOPLE IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY 
IMRAN KHAN RAISED THE MONEY FOR HIS CANCER HOSPITAL IN LAHORE 
BY DOING ALL HIS SPORTS RELICS HIS GLOVES AND BALLS AND HIS BATS DID HE 
BUT YOU SEE HOW THIS BIFURCATES COMPLETELY BETWEEN 
THE CHARISMATIC PERSONALITY IN THE PUBLIC EYE WHO IS ICON RELIC 
AND THAT'S ALL OUR SORT OF POP IDOLS WHO COME AND GO 
ALTHOUGH WHEN I WAS YOUNG I MEAN I FELT IT FROM THE BEATLES 
IF YOU SAW THEM LIVE WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED 
OR BOB DYLAN IT WAS BOB DYLAN 
YES DYLAN BUT THAT'S STILL THE CASE 
ON THE FALLS ROAD IT WAS 
THAT'S STILL THE CASE WE'D HEARD THIS GUY 
BUT TALKING ABOUT THE FALLS ROAD YOU'VE HAD SAINTS ON THE FALLS ROAD YEAH 
YEAH AND WE HAD DENNIS FALL TO QUOTE A NAME THAT'S JUST DIED 
YEAH YOU KNOW AND THERE WAS ACTUALLY THIS IDEA ON THE FALLS ROAD 
THAT YOU COULD AT ANY TIME AT ALL 
COME ACROSS AN OSTENSIBLY ORDINARY OR ODD GUY 
WHO WAS A S. S A S. YOU KNOW 
YOU ALSO HAVE THE MARTYROLOGY AND THE ICONOGRAPHY DON'T YOU WITH THE MURALS UP ON THE 
YEAH THE PRISONERS IN PRISON THEY DO THE STARVATION AND HUNGER STRIKES 
AND EVEN THE IDEA OF THE POLLUTION OF THE SACRED 
YOU KNOW THE DIRT AND THINGS BECAUSE THEY WORE THESE YOU KNOW 
BOBBY SANDS IS A MODERN 
YEAH REVOLUTIONARY MARTYRS IN THE NATIONALIST MOVEMENT WHO USED FAECES TO I NOW HAVE A LINE 
I NOW HAVE A LINE RIGHT 
THE KEEPERS OF THE PRISON THEY ASKED IT OF ME 
HOW GOOD HOW GOOD DOES IT FEEL TO BE FREE 
AND I ANSWERED THEM MOST MYSTERIOUSLY 
ARE THE BIRDS FREE IN THE CHAINS OF THE SKYWAYS 
AND IT IS ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW HOW FAR ARE YOU INVOLVED IN THE OLD STORY 
HOW FAR ARE YOU COMING TO DO YOUR OWN THING 
I MEAN SOMETIMES I'VE FOUND LOOKING 
I MEAN YOU'VE JUST REMINDED ME OF A SORT OF PROCESS THAT HAPPENS IN THE MAKING OF SAINTS 
WHICH IS THAT SOMETIMES BY CHANCE 
A PERSON'S LIFE OR CHARACTERISTICS FIT A PRECONCEIVED FORMAL PATTERN 
OR THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO WHICH LIFE LEADS THEM 
AND YOU SAY THAT IS THE PERSON LO AND BEHOLD YOU KNOW 
THAT HE OR SHE FITS TO WHATEVER 
SOME CLASSIC FORM OF A MARTYR OR CLASSIC FORM OF THE 
WHATEVER KIND OF AN ICON YOU KNOW AND I THINK THAT 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN ALL OF THIS IS THAT IT'S AN ICON 
IT'S AN ICON THAT WAS BUILT ON AN ICON 
THAT WAS BUILT ON AN ICON THAT WAS BUILT ON AN ICON 
YOU SAW ME CRYING IN THE CHAPEL 
THE TEARS I SHED WERE TEARS OF JOY 
I KNOW THE MEANING OF CONTENTMENT 
NOW I'M HAPPY WITH THE LORD 
WE SEE THE HOUSE OF ELVIS PRESLEY YOU KNOW 
I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE REALLY BELIEVE THAT PRESLEY IS NOT DEAD 
AND WILL COME BACK TO LIFE ONE DAY RESURRECT AND MAKE MIRACLES 
MAYBE WE ARE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER YOU KNOW 
WHICH COULD BE QUITE INTERESTING TO UNDERSTAND THE RELIGIONS FROM THE PAST HOW THEY WERE BORN YOU KNOW 
IT TAKES ALWAYS A LONG TIME 
IT TOOK TWO CENTURIES TO 
CHRISTIANITY TO BECOME A REAL RELIGION YOU KNOW 
WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE AND AN ORGANISATION AND A POPE YOU KNOW 
AND A SACRED TEXT VERY WELL CHOSEN AND REWRITTEN 
SO WHO KNOWS 
MAYBE WE ARE LIVING NEXT TO GODS TO COME 
WHEN YOU SPEAK ABOUT AN ICON I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT ANYBODY FROM THE MEDIA AS BEING AN ICON 
SUCCESS IS NOT DEFINED BY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT ONE MAKES OR THE STYLE OF HAIR 
OR THE KIND OF CLOTHES OR THE DEVELOPED BODY BUT THESE ARE ALL PASSING 
EPHEMERAL THINGS THAT THE HUMAN BEING WOULD DO WELL TO THINK SECONDARILY ABOUT 
BUT WHAT ART DOES WHAT SAINTS DO IS THEY CALL US TO THINK BEYOND 
TO THINK OF THE VALUES THAT NEVER CHANGE THE VALUES THAT ARE ETERNAL 
THE IN DEPTH VALUES THAT TOUCH OUR HEART AND SOUL AND TOUCH THE HEART AND SOUL OF HUMANKIND 
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT LAST THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE ETERNAL 
THEY DON'T DEPEND ON THE WHIMS OF TELEVISION OR A T. V. PROGRAMME OR 
OR A FILM OR AN ART CRITIC 
DIDN'T YOU LONG TO BE A SAINT 
MY FATHER MY MOTHER 
YOUR FATHER PROBABLY WAS A SAINT TALKED TO ME FROM THE AGE OF YOU'RE GOING TO BE A SAINT 
YOU KNOW YEAH 
WHAT ABOUT A PRIEST THEY WANTED YOU TO BE A PRIEST TOO 
OH YES 
TWICE A WEEK 
SAINT PILATES 
I THINK FOR MOST OF US WE WILL GET TO HEAVEN BY BEING DILIGENT IN THE LITTLE THINGS 
SOMETIMES WE WAIT FOR SOMETHING DRAMATIC TO HAPPEN AND IT SELDOM DOES 
OUR LIVES ARE FULL OF POTS AND PANS AS IT WERE 
AND I THINK THAT IS WHERE WE FIND THE SAINTS IN THE ORDINARY THINGS OF LIFE 
THAT ON THIS DAY ALL THE SAINTS COME TOGETHER 
TO INTERCEDE UNIVERSALLY FOR US WAS SHOWN IN A VISION 
WHICH WE ARE TOLD OCCURRED A YEAR AFTER THE INSTITUTION OF THE FEAST 
ON THIS DAY THE WARDEN OF THE CHURCH OF SAINT PETER DEVOUTLY WENT AROUND 
TO ALL THE ALTARS AND IMPLORED THE HELP OF ALL THE SAINTS 
WHEN HE'D GOT BACK TO SAINT PETER'S ALTAR HE RESTED FOR A SHORT WHILE AND WAS RAPT IN ECSTASY 
HE SAW THE KING OF KINGS SEATED ON A HIGH THRONE SURROUNDED BY ALL THE ANGELS 
THEN THE VIRGIN OF VIRGINS CAME FORWARD WEARING A GLEAMING DIADEM 
AND FOLLOWED BY AN INNUMERABLE MULTITUDE OF VIRGINS 
THEN CAME A MAN CLAD IN CAMEL SKINS WHOM A LARGE NUMBER OF ANCIENTS FOLLOWED 
AND AFTER THEM ANOTHER MAN WEARING PONTIFICAL VESTMENTS 
AND ACCOMPANIED BY A CHORUS OF MEN SIMILARLY ATTIRED 
NEXT A GREAT ARMY OF SOLDIERS ADVANCED AND THEN A VAST THRONG OF MEN AND WOMEN OF EVERY RACE 
ALL GATHERED BEFORE THE KING'S THRONE AND KNELT DOWN TO ADORE HIM 
THE MAN IN CAMEL SKINS WAS JOHN THE BAPTIST WITH THE PATRIARCHS AND PROPHETS 
THE ONE IN THE ROBES OF A PONTIFF WAS SAINT PETER WITH THE OTHER APOSTLES 
THE SOLDIERS WERE THE MARTYRS 
ALL THESE PEOPLE HAD COME BEFORE THE KING TO THANK HIM FOR THE HONOUR 
DONE THEM BY MORTALS ON THIS DAY AND TO PRAY FOR THE WHOLE WORLD 
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN RATHER FOND OF BOOKS
