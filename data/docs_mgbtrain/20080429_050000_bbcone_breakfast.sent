HER SIX SURVIVING CHILDREN ARE NOW 
BEING CARED FOR BY THE AUTHORITIES 
OUR CORRESPONDENT IS IN AMSTETTEN 
THAT IS IN AUSTRIA A SENSE OF 
SHOCK HOW DID NOBODY KNOW WHAT WAS 
GOING ON IN THAT HOUSE BEHIND YOU 
THAT IS RIGHT TODAY'S NEWSPAPERS 
TODAY IN AUSTRIA ASK THAT 
QUESTIONMENT THIS MORNING HE 
REMAINS IN PRETRIAL DETENTION THE 
SEVENTY THREE YEAR OLD RETIRED ENGINEER HAS 
CONFESSED HIS CRIMES CRIMES WHICH 
HAVE LEFT THIS TOWN AND COUNTRY IN 
SHOCK SHOCK UNDER ARREST THE AUSTRIAN PENSIONER 
WITH A TERRIFYING SECRET FOR TWENTY FOUR 
YEARS HE HAD KEPT HIS DAUGHTER 
LOCKED UP IN THE BASEMENT OF THE 
FAMILY HOME HELD HERE FROM EIGHTEEN SHE 
WAS ABUSED BY HER FATHER SHE GAVE 
BIRTH TO SEVEN OF HER FATHER'S 
CHILDREN ONE DIED 
HIS DAUGHTER AT 
THE TIME EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD WAS SELECTED 
BY HIM AND LOCKED IN HIS CELLAR HE 
ADMITTED TO THAT HE ALSO ADMITTED 
THAT HE PRESSURISED HER THERE 
BEATED HER THERE INCARCERATED HER 
AGAINST HER WILL 
IMAGINE LIVING 
HERE FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS IN THIS 
UNDERGROUND DUNGEON LOW CEILINGS 
WITHOUT A SINGLE WINDOW NEVER 
SEEING THE LIGHT OF DAY AND EXPOSED 
TO SEXUAL ABUSE THE BASEMENT IS 
SAID TO BE SO DEEP THAT ANY CRYS 
FOR HELP WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HEARD 
ELISABETH AND HER CHILDREN ARE

AUTHORITIES IT HAS BEEN HOW HIS 
WIFE SOCIAL WORKERS AND NEIGHBOURS 
COULD NOT HAVE NOTICED THE 
DISCOVERY OF AUSTRIA'S HOUSE OF 
HORROR HAS SHOCKED AND EMBARRASSED 
THIS TOWN AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY 
WELL HERE IS ONE REGIONAL AUSTRIAN 
NEWSPAPER THIS MORNING THE 
HEADLINE SAYS ONE CONFESSION AND 
ONE THOUSAND QUESTIONS THERE IS A 
FEELING HERE IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME 
A LONG TIME FOR ALL THESE QUESTIONS 
TO FIND AN ANSWER YOU CAN FIND OUT 
MORE ABOUT THAT STORY AS IT 
DEVELOPED WITH THE B. B. C. NEWS WEBSITE 
RESEARCHERS SAY THEY HAVE FOUND ED 
THAT GOING TO NURSERY OR PLAYGROUND 
HELPS PROTECT CHILDREN AGAINST 
LEUKAEMIA FOURTEEN STUDIES CONCLUDE THAT 
CHILDREN EXPOSED TO INFECTIONS AT 
YOUNG AGE SHOW RESISTANT TO 
DEVELOPING THE COMMONEST FORM OF 
THE DISEASE THESE TODDLERS ARE 
LEARNING TO PLAY TOGETHER AND 
ENCOUNTERING MORE INFECTIONS THAN 
THEY WOULD MEET AT HOME THAT MAY 
REDUCE BY THIRTY PER CENT THEIR RISK OF 
DEVELOPING THE COMMONEST FORM OF 
LEUKAEMIA THE THEORY IS THAT 
CHILDREN LIKE THESE WHO GET LOTS OF 
EXPOSURE TO INFECTION HAVE THEIR 
IMMUNE SYSTEMS CHALLENGED AT A VERY 
EARLY AGE KIDS WHO DON'T GET THAP 
AND HAVE A AGAIN MET TICK MUTIGS 
ARE FAR MORE ABLE TO GET LOUCK LUKE 
YOU CAN SAY TO PEOPLE SEND YOUR 
CHILDREN TO DAY CARE LET THEM EAT 
DIRT LET THEM HAVE LOTS OF EARLY 
INFECTIONS IT IS GOOD FOR THEM IT 
IS NICE TO BE ABLE TO SAY THOSE 
THINGS WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF 
CONFIDENCE 
PARENTS AT THIS GROUP CONFIDENCE ARE ALREADY KEEN TO MAKE SURE THEIR 
TODDLERS COME ACROSS LOTS OF BUGS 
IF I KEPT HER CLOSED UP AT HOME 
SHE WOULD PROBABLY BE VERY SICK 
WHEN I PUT HER INTO SCHOOL 
IF THEY 
DIDN'T AND THEY ARE FOUR AND GO TO 
SCHOOL THEN THEY WILL GET IT HARDER 
CHILDHOOD LEUKAEMIA IS 
COMPLICATED CONDITION WITH SEVERAL 
POSSIBLE CAUSES INCLUDING 
RADIOATION HIGH POWER VOLTAGE 
LINES AND TRAFFIC POLLUTION MAKING 
SURE YOUR TODDLERS ENCOUNTER LOTS 
OF INFECTIONS MAY BE ONE WAY TO 
HELP PREVENT IT

TIME TO MOVE ON THANKFULLY THAT 
STORY THAT YOU TWO SHOWED US FROM 
THE FRONT OF THE TELEGRAPH ABOUT 
TIN VESTGATION INTO THE 
SUPERMARKETS BUT BIG SUPPLIERS 
SUPERMARKETS HAVE MADE THE ARGUMENT 
ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE 
BALANCE OF RETAIL YOU SHOULD NOT 
FORGET YOU HAVE BIG GIANTS LIKE 
UNILEVER AND PROCTER AND AMP GAMBLE GOING 
NOSE TO NOSE WITH THE SUPERMARKETS 
WHEN IT COMES TO HOW MUCH WE PAY 
FOR THINGS THERE IS THE CREATER OF 
ANOTHER BIG SUPPLIER BECAUSE OF A 
DEAL IN THE UNITED STATES IT 
INVOLVES CONFECTIONARY THIS IS THE 
WALL STREET JOURNAL IN EUROPE IT 
SAYS THAT DEAL MIGHT SPARK ANOTHER 
DEAL POSSIBLY BETWEEN CADBURY'S 
AND THE AMERICAN CHOCOLATE FIRM 
WE'RE MONITORING TWO STORIES HERE 
THE FIRST IS MASSIVE PROFITS AT THE 
BIG OIL GIANTS BOTH B. P. AND SHELL 
TELL US IN THE NEXT HOUR HOW MUCH 
THEY'RE MAKING THEY'RE LIKELY TO 
TELL US THEY MADE A COMBINED PROFIT 
OF SIX BILLION IN THREE MONTHS OF 
TRADING THIS WOULD BE A RERIVAL 
FOR B. P. WHICH SAW PROFITS FALL LAST 
YEAR DOWN BY TWENTY PER CENT SHELL MADE 
RECORD PROFITS THE BIGGEST PROFIT 
EVER MADE BY A BRITISH COMPANY LAST 
YEAR THEY'RE ALL BENEFITING FROM 
THE RISE IN THE PRICE OF OIL CLOSE 
TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS A BARREL YESTERDAY FOR 
EVERY DOLLAR THAT THE BARREL GOES 
UP BY IT ADDS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION TO THE 
OPERATING PROFITS STORY NUMBER TWO 
IS HALIFAX BANK OF SCOTLAND MANY 
OF YOU WILL OWN SHARES IN THAT OF 
COURSE YOU GOT FREE SHARES WHEN 
THE HALIFAX TURNED NO AYE BANK 
WE'RE EXPECTING IT TO CONFIRM THAT 
IT WANTS SHAREHOLDERS INCLUDING 
YOU TO COUGH UP SOME FOUR BILLION 
BETWEEN YOU BY SELLING CHEAP SHARES 
IN THE BUSINESS 
SHARES OVERALL IN LONDON WERE ONE 
POINT LOWER 
THANK 
THANK YOU THIS IS BREAKFAST THESE 
ARE THE MAIN STORIES THE MAN WHO 
IMPRISONED HIS DAUGHTER IN A 
BASEMENT FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS FACES FURTHER 
QUESTIONING BY AUSTRIAN POLICE 
THERE'S NEW EVIDENCE TODAY THAT 
GOING TO NURSERY WITH OTHER 
CHILDREN REDUCES A TODDLER'S 
CHANCES OF GETTING LEUKAEMIA 
A CENSUS OF THE PUFFIN POPULATION 
GETS UNDER WAY WE LOOK AT THE 
DANGERS FOR THESE RAINBOW BILLED 
SEA BIRDS 
DID SOMEONE SAY RAINBOW 
YES HAVE 
WE GOT ONE LET'S HAVE CAROL 
DID SOMEONE SAY RAINBOW YES HAVE WE GOT ONE LET'S HAVE CAROL 
NOT YET BUT THERE WILL BE ONE 
TODAY WE'RE EXPECTING RAIN THE 
OTHER THING WE'RE EXPECTING ARE 
HEAVY SHOWERS SOME OF US HAVE 
SHOWERS ALREADY WE'LL HAVE HAIL 
THUNDER AND LIGHTNING AND SLOW 
MOVING SLOWER THAN YESTERDAY THAT 
MEANS THAT SOME OF US WILL MISS 
THEM ALL TOGETHER THIS MORNING ON 
THE RADAR YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE 
SHOWERS ARE SOMETHING I WANT TO 
DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO IS WHAT'S 
HAPPEN ANYTHING THE SOUTH WEST 
THERE'S A BAND OF RAIN SWEEPING 
ACROSS THE ISLES OF SCILLY THAT 
MOVES ACROSS US DURING THE DAY 
THIS MORNING A CHILLY START FOR 
SOME OF US WITH A TOUCH OF FROST 
SOME PATCHY FOG AROUND IN THE 
NORTH OF ENGLAND THERE'S SHOWERS 
AMIDST THE CLOUD SHOWERS TOO 
ACROSS THE FAR SOUTH OF ENGLAND AND 
QUITE A BIT OF CLOUD BUT BREAKS IN 
THE CLOUD AS WE HAVE HERE IN LONDON 
WITH SUNSHINE COMING THROUGH AS WE 
SWEEP INTO THE SOUTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND WELL YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE 
RAIN WILL BE ROUGHLY BY NINE A M. AHEAD 
THIS AFTERNOON RAIN BAND IN WALES 
AGAIN SOME SHOWERS BUT BRIGHTER 
SKIES TO THE NORTH OF WALES 
ARRANGE ANGLECY AS WELL BRIGHTER 
SKIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND SHOWERY 
DAY FOR SOME OF US THE RAIN 
SLOWING MOVING IN WHEN IT SETS IN 
IT WILL BE WITH US FOR UP TO FIVE 
HOURS AT TIME IT'S WILL BE QUITE 
HEAVY AS IT MOVE AS CROSS THE 
SOUTH OF ENGLAND WALES HEADING 
INTO THE MIDLANDS AND EAST ANGLA 
WINDY AROUND THIS RAIN BAND AS WELL 
THROUGH THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT 
THE RAIN CONTINUES TO MOVE 
NORTHWARDS IT PUSHES ACROSS WALES 
AS IT PIVOTS ROUND ALSO INTO THE 
NORTH OF ENGLAND AND SOUTHERN AND 
EASTERN SCOTLAND TONIGHT TOO MAYBE 
A TOUCH OF FROST AND PATCHY MIST OR 
FOG TOMORROW THE RAIN BAND IS 
STILL VERY MUCH WITH US THIS TIME 
ACROSS SCOTLAND POSSIBLY FRINGING 
EASTERN PARTS OF NORTHERN IRELAND 
WALES ELSEWHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT 
SPELLS OF SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS 
SOME OF THE SHOWERS MERGING SO AT 
TIMES AGAIN WE SEE HEAVIER DOWN 
POURS AND LIKE TODAY TOMORROW SOME 
OF THE SHOWERS WILL HAVE HAIL AND 
ALSO SOME THUNDER AND LIGHTNING 
SATURDAY IS LOOKING GOOD FOR MOST 
OF US 
SATURDAY IS LOOKING GOOD FOR MOST OF US 
OF US A BIT OF GOOD NEWS WITH THEIR 
RAINBOW BILLS AND DISTINCTIVE 
PLUMAGE YOU WOULD IMAGINE THAT 
PUFFINS WOULD BE EASY TO SPOT AND 
COUNT 
CONSERVATIONISTS ARE COUNT CARRYING OUT A CENSUS OF PUFFINS ON 
THE FARNE ISLANDS HAVE FOUND THE 
SEA BIRDS ARE NOT AS FRIENDLY AS 
THEY LOOK DANNY SAVAGE IS AT SEA 
HOUSES HARBOUR 
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MORNING HERE ON 
THE COAST OF NORTHUMBERLAND TODAY 
BUT IT'S A FAR CRY FROM LAST SUMMER 
ALTHOUGH IT RAIN AND SPOILED OUR 
HOLIDAYS FOR THE BIRDS WHO LIVE ON 
THE ISLANDS BEHIND ME IT WAS A LIFE 
OR DEATH SITUATION THOUSANDS OF 
THEM HAD THEIR NESTS WASHED AWAY 
PARTICULARLY FOR PUFFINS THEY LIVE 
IN BURROWS UNDERGROUND THEY WERE 
FLOODED OUT THE WARDENS WHO RUN 
THE GARDENS THERE FOR THE NATIONAL 
TRUST ARE HOPING FOR BETTER THING 
THAT'S YEAR 
THEY ARE AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS 
THE CLOWNS OF THE AIR THEIR BRIGHT 
BILLS INQUIZTIVE LOOKS AND FUNNY 
WALK MAKE PUFFINS A FIRM FAVOURITE 
OF VISITORS TO BRITAIN'S SEA BIRD 
COLONIES EVERY FIVE YEARS HERE ON 
THE FARNE ISLANDS THERE'S A HEAD 
COUNT NOT EASY WHEN THEY ALL LOCK 
THE SAME AND KEEP MOVING 
YOU CAN 
SEE ONE OF THE POSTS HERE FROM 
PREVIOUS SURVEYS 
THE COUNTERS SAY 
THERE'S REAL VALUE TO THE SURVEY 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE 
PUFFINS ARE AN ENVIRONMENTAL 
BAROMETER FOR THE FARNE ISLANDS AND 
THE NORTH SEA COUNTING THE 
POPULATION WE CAN SEE IF THEY'RE 
DOING WELL OR DOING BAD IF SO THE 
REASONS BEHIND THAT 
PUFFINS NEST 
IN BURROWS WHERE EACH PAIR RAISES 
A SINGLE CHICK SO TO GET AN 
ACCURATE POPULATION COUNT THE LONG 
ARM OF THE WARDEN COMES CALLING 
WE'LL RING A SMALL NUMBER OF BIRDS 
DURING THE COURSE OF THE SEASON WE 
BRING THEM OUT AND CHECK THEIR BODY 
WEIGHT AND BODY MASS AND THEN PUT 
IT BACK 
THE RESULTS SO FAR THIS 
YEAR ARE ENCOURAGING IF THE PUFFIN 
NUMBERS ARE ON THE INCREASE THAT'S 
GOOD 
ALL THE OTHER BIRDS 
THAT LIVE HERE TOO LIKE THIS RAZOR 
BILL AND THE SHAD CLEANING ITSELF 
BEHIND IT THERE'S PLENTY OF FOOD 
IN THE SEA TO SUPPORT THE TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF BIRDS WHO LIVE HERE 
THROUGHOUT THE SPRING AND SUMMER 
BUT IT'S THE PUFFINS THAT DRAW THE 
CROWDS 
IT'S A MOST LIKEABLE BIRD CROWDS VERY COMICAL THEY DO LITTLE ANTICS 
VERY ENDEARING LOVELY LITTLE 
THINGS 
EXPERTS HOPE TO COUNT THINGS SIXTY THOUSAND PAIRS BREEDING ON THIS 
COLONY IN THE COMING WEEKS 
THAT WILL BE TEN THOUSAND MORE BIRDS THAN 
WERE HERE FIVE YEARS AGO THAT'S 
GOOD NEWS FOR THE PUFFIN POPULATION 
IT'S GOOD NEWS FOR THE FARNE 
ISLANDS REALLY THEY DEPEND ON 
TOURISM AND PEOPLE COMING HERE TO 
SEE THE BIRDS HOWEVER IT IS FAIRLY 
REGIONAL YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO FAR 
FURTHER NORTH IN THE NORTH SEA OR 
ROUND TO THE ATLANTIC COAST OF THE 
U. K. TO FIND SIMILAR BIRD COLONIES 
SUFFERING BADLY IT'S DOWN TO THE 
MAIN SOURCE OF FOOD FOR THEM SAND 
EELS IF THEY'RE NOT IN THE SEA 
THE BIRDS HAVE NO FOOD AND THAT 
MEAN THAT'S THEY STARVE AND THE 
YOUNG AS WELL THANKFULLY THAT'S 
NOT SITUATION HERE WHICH MEANS 
THAT THE FARNE ISLANDS ARE 
INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT HABITAT FOR 
WILDLIFE SNFPT THANK S. VERY MUCH

BILLION FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS 
OF TRADING SO IN JUST THREE MONTHS 
OF TRADING SHELL MADE PROFIT OF 
THREE POINT NINE BILLION THAT IS TWELVE PER CENT MORE THAN 
IT WAS MAKING THIS TIME A YEAR AGO 
IT IS PUTTING THE INCREASE IN 
PROFITS DOWN TO THE RISE IN THE OIL 
PRICE SO THREE POINT NINE BILLION PROFIT AT 
SHELL OVER THREE MONTHS OF TRADING 
WE WILL HAVE ANALYSIS FOR THAT IN 
FIFTEEN MINUTES' TIME THANK YOU FOR ALL 
YOUR E. MAILS TEXT MESSAGES ABOUT 
SECRETARIES AND THE THINGOUS ARE 
ASKED TO DO BY YOUR BOSSES WHETHER 
YOUR BOSS IS MALE OR FEMALE 
WALKING THE DOG ORGANISING HOUSE 
HOUSES THAT SORT OF THING LET'S 
TURN ATTENTION TO THAT STORY OF 
LEUKAEMIA YOU HEARD IN THE NEWS IT 
IS A DISTRESSING ILLNESS IT 
AFFECTS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN EVERY YEAR 
IN THE U. K. A REPORT SUGGESTS SOME 
TODDLERS WHO GO TO NURSERY ARE 
BETTER PROTECTED AGAINST DEVELOPING 
THE DISEASE BECAUSE OF EXPOSURE TO 
INFECTIONS EARLY LER IN LIFE WE 
TALK TO PATRICIA BUFFLER FROM THE 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IT IS 
INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU HAVE 
REACHED A BIG CONCLUSION FROM 
ANALYSING OTHER STUDYS IN EFFECT 
IT IS A SORT OF BIG PICTURE BREAK 
THROUGH RATHER THAN A MEDICAL BREAK 
THROUGH YOU SEEM TO BE CELEBRATING 
THAT IS CORRECT 
TILL US IN DETAIL 
THEN IF YOU CAN WHY WOULD IT BE 
BETTER FOR CHILDREN TO GO TO PLAY 
GROUP TO AVOID THE RISKS OF 
LEUKAEMIA 
WELL WE DON'T UNDERSTAND LEUKAEMIA THE MECHANISMS THAT ARE BEHIND THIS 
BUT IT DOES APPEAR WHEN WE LOOK AT 
THE WORLD LITERATURE THERE ARE FOURTEEN 
PUBLISHED STUDIES KNOW FROM 
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THAT OVERALL 
WE ARE SEEING A THIRTY PER CENT REDUCTION IN 
LEUKAEMIA RISK FOR THE CHILDREN WHO 
HAVE BEEN IN PLAY GROUPS HAD THE 
OPPORTUNITY THAT SOCIAL 
EXPERIENCE OF BEING AROUND OTHER 
CHILDREN EARLY IN LIFE COMPARED TO 
CHILDREN WHO DON'T HAVE THOSE 
EXPERIENCES THAT PROVIDES US WITH 
SOME FIRMER UNDERSTANDING OF THE 
POTENTIAL ROLE OF INFECTION OR A 
NEW REGULATION OF N. THIS DISEASE 
PROCESS 
REMIND US WHAT LEUKAEMIA PROCESS DOES TO PEOPLE 
LEUKAEMIA IS A MALIGNANSY OF THE 
BLOOD CELLS 
WITH CHILDHOOD LEUKAEMIA TODAY 
TREATMENT IS FAIRLY EFFECTIVE AND 
SEVENTY FIVE TO EIGHTY PER CENT OF THESE CHILDREN IN THE 
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES DO SURVIVE THE 
DISEASE HOWEVER THE TREATMENT AND 
THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE IS SUCH THAT 
WE WOULD PREFER TO PREVENT THIS 
DISEASE 
SO IT IS LINKED TO WHEN DISEASE KIDS GO TO NURSERIES THEY PICK UP 
COLDS AND CUFFS THAT SORT OF THING 
IS THAT DEVELOPING THAT STRENGTH 
AGAINST THAT SORT OF THING IS THAT 
WHAT IS DOING IT IN TERMS OF 
LEUKAEMIA 
IT IS BELIEVED HAVING LEUKAEMIA THAT EXPERIENCE EARLY IN LIFE DOES 
PREPARE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM BETTER 
THAN IF A CHILD WAS ISOLATED AND 
DIDN'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF 
HAVING A LARGE NUMBER OF SIBLINGS 
OF THE EXPERIENCE IN PLAY GROUPS 
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF CHILD 
DEVELOPING LEUKAEMIA ANY WAY ABOUT ABOUT ONE IN TWO THOUSAND CHILDREN WILL DEVELOP 
LEUKAEMIA 
ARE THERE ANY OTHER WAYS LEUKAEMIA YOU FOUND THAT PARENTS CAN AVOID 
THEIR CHILDREN CONTRACTING THE 
DISEASE IN ADDITION 
EXPERIENCE THAT WE PUT TOGETHER 
WITH REGARD TO SOCIAL GROUPS THE 
RESEARCH WE AND OTHERS ARE 
CONDUCTING RIGHT NOW HAS INDICATED 
UNDERLYING THE IMPORTANCE OF A DIET 
BALANCED IN FRUITS VEGETABLES 
PROTEIN BOTH THE MOTHER'S DIET AND 
CHILD'S DIET 
BACK TO FIVE A DAY 
ABSOLUTELY JUST WHAT YOUR 
GRANDMOTHER TOLD YOU 
DOCTOR BUFFLER 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW IT IS THE 
COMPUTER GAME WHICH LOOKS SET TO 
BREAK SALES RECORDS IT IS THE 
FOURTH INSTALMENT OF GRAND THEFT 
AUTO IT IS A CERTIFICATE EIGHTEEN THERE 
IS CONCERN ABOUT THE VIOLENT 
CONTENT WHICH INCLUDES SHOOTINGS 
AND DRUGS SEVERAL SHOPS OPENED AT 
MIDNIGHT FOR THE LAUNCH SOME FANS 
COULD NOT WAIT TO GET THEIR HANDS 
ON A COP PI WE WENT ALONG TO 
COPY WE WENT ALONG TO MEET SOME 
IT IS FUN THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE 
REAL ACTORS AND JUST LIKE THE STORY 
LINES ARE OSCAR WORTHY 
I THINK IT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM 
EVERYTHING ELSE A LOT OF GAMES TRY 
AND COP PI IT THIS IS ORIGINAL FOR 
WHAT IT DOES 
SMUGGLE PEOPLE SHOOT PEOPLE 
IT IS 
A VERY VIOLENT GAME BUT AT THE END 
OF THE DAY IT IS A GAME 
IT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST FRANCHISES 
EVEN SINCE ITS BIRTH ON P. S. ONE IT WAS 
STILL BIG 
SO FANS QUEUING UP FOR THE NEW 
VERSION OF GRAND THEFT AUTO LET'S 
SPEAK TO THE TECHNOLOGY ED DOR FOR 
THE B. B. C. NEWS WEBSITE HAVE YOU 
PLAYED IT YES 
WHAT IS THE BIG YES THING 
THE EPIC NATURE OF THE GAME THING IT HAS BEEN THREE YEARS IN THE 
MAKING COST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS 
OF DOLLARS TO MAKE LIKE A MOVIE 
IT IS EXPECTED TO TAKE MORE THAN 
THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN JUST ONE WEEK THAT 
WOULD MAKE IT THE BIGGEST 
ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCT OF ALL TIME 
ANY OTHER FILM OW VIDEO GAME IT IS 
BIG MONEY BIG BUSINESS 
HOW IS IT 
DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER STROO GAME 
ON THE MARKET NOW 
IT IS VERY EPIC 
YOU PLAY AN IMMIGRANT WHO HAS COME 
TO NEW YORK A FICTIONAL NEW YORK 
TO FIND FAME AND FORTUNE HE HAS A 
DODGEY PAST HE IS IN A WORLD OF 
DRUGS PROSTITUTION IT IS LIKE THE 
MOVIE SCAR FACE IT IS VERYVY LEBT 
AND INTENSE 
IT HAS AN EIGHTEEN 
CERTIFICATE IT DOES NOT MEAN 
CHILDREN CANNOT PICK IT UP ON LINE 
OR EVEN IF THEIR PARENTS BUY IT FOR 
THEM 
WE ARE ONLY A FEW MONTHS THEM AFTER THE BIR RON REVIEW IT SAID 
TWO THINGS THAT THE GAMES INDUSTRY 
IS A SENSIBLE INDUSTRY WHICH TAKES 
CARE TO MAKE SURE THE GAMES DON'T 
FALL INTO THE HANDS OF CHILDREN IT 
TALKS ABOUT PARENTAL KNOWLEDGE 
PARENTS DO NOT UNDERSTAND THESE 
RATINGS THEY ARE FILM RATINGS EIGHTEEN 
MEANS YOU HAVE TO BE EIGHTEEN YEARS TO 
PLAY IT IT DOES NOT MEAN EIGHTEEN YOUR 
LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE ROCK STAR 
THE DEVELOPERS THEY PORTRAY 
THEMSELVES AS MATURE RESPONSIBLE 
THERE HAS NOT BEEN ADVERTISING ON 
TELEVISION'S MAGAZINES OR 
TELEVISION THEY SEE THIS AS AN 
ADULT GAME 
IS THERE ANY SUGGESTION 
THAT IF YOU PLAY A VIOLENT VIDEO 
GAME YOU ARE LIKELY TO REPLICATE 
THAT VIOLENCE IN REAL LIFE 
ALL THE 
CLINICAL STUDIES DOCTOR B. YRON SAID 
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT YOU WOULD 
COP PI THE VIOLENCE YOU SEE IN REAL 
LIFE THERE HAVE SOME BEEN REPORTS 
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SAY THERE 
IS A LINK 
WATCHING IT THERE IT 
WOULD BOOST YOUR ADRENALINE LEVELS 
IT WOULD PUMP YOU UP 
IT IS AN 
INCREDIBLY EXCITING GAME YOU ARE 
RUNNING AROUND SHOOTING DRIVING 
CARS AT HIGH SPEED THERE IS 
DRUNKEN DRIVING SEX IT IS AN 
INTENSE EXPERIENCE BUT NO MORE SO 
THAN WATCHING A MOVIE LIKE SCAR 
FACE WHICH IS IN YOUR FACE YOU YOU CANNOT DIRECT 
THE ACTION YOU YOU CANNOT DIRECT THE ACTION THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTERACTIVE 
ENTERTAINMENT AND MOVIES OF COURSE 
YOU SWITCH THE CONSOLE OFF L. HAVE 
BEEN PLAYING IT ALL YESTERDAY AND I 
FEEL PRETTY NORMAL 
JUST AS WELL AS 
HE IS SITTING NEXT TO US IT IS ALL 
WHOLESOME STUFF DRUNKEN DRIVING 
PROSTITUTION ALL NORMAL THINGS 
YOU DO 
THIS IS BREAKFAST THESE ARE OUR 
MAIN STORIES THIS MORNING THE MAN 
WHO IMPRISONED HIS OWN DAUGER IN A 
BASEMENT FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS WILL FACE 
FURTHER QUESTIONING BY AUSTRIAN 
POLICE TODAY THERE IS NEW EVIDENCE 
THAT GOING TO NURSERY WITH OTHER 
CHILDREN REDUCES A CHILD'S CHANCES 
OF GETTING LEUKAEMIA WE WILL MEET 
A CHEF WHO HAS PERSUADED MILLIONS 
OF INDIAN FAMILIES TO TRY 
SHEPHERD'S PIE AND FISH AND CHIPS

LET'S LOCK AT 
THIS MORNING'S PAPERS 
LET'S LOCK AT THIS MORNING'S PAPERS THE SUN LEADING ON THE AUSTRIAN 
STORY AS WE R. THEY HAVE A PICTURE 
INSIDE THE HOUSE THE MONSTER'S 
DUNGEON IT SAYS IN WHICH JOSEF 
FRITZL KEPT HIS DAUGHTER AND THREE 
CHILDREN QUESTION ON THE FRONT 
PAGE OF THE DAILY MAIL WHICH A LOT 
OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING THIS MORNING 
HOW COULD HIS WIFE NOT HAVE KNOWN 
SHE WAS BRINGING UP THREE OF THE 
CHILDREN THEY HAD ALLEGEDLY BEEN 
LEFT ON THE DOORSTEP THE DAUGHTER 
WAS DOWN STAIRS ALL THE TIME THE 
MAIN STORY GORDON BROWN IS TO TAKE 
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
TOUGHENING THE LAW ON CANNABIS THE 
PRIME MINISTER WANTS TO RETURN IT 
TO CLASS B. STATUS 
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH HAS WHAT IT'S 
CALLING AN EXCLUSIVE SAYING ABOUT 
ONE HUNDRED LEADING HOUSEHOLD BRANDS ARE AT 
THE CENTRE OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO 
ALLEGATIONS OF PRICE FIXING 
INCLUDING GROCERY PRODUCTS DRAWN UP 
BY THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING 
THE DAILY EXPRESS IS TALKING ABOUT 
BIG DIESEL AND PETROL RIP OFF 
BRITISH MOTORISTS ARE BEING RIPPED 
OFF BY PROFITEERING OIL COMPANIES 
AND THE GOVERNMENT THIS COMES AS 
WE HEAR DECLAN BREAKING NEWS 
EARLIER THAN SHELL'S PROFITS HAVE 
GONE UP BY THIRTY NINE BILLION MORE ON 
THAT IN A MOMENT 
THE METRO FOCUSES ON THE FAMILY 
WHICH MADE A NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE CALL AS AXE 
WIELDING BURGLARS ENTERED THEIR 
HOME AND THE POLICE WERE TOO BUSY 
LET'S GET MORE ON THE PROFITS FROM 
SHELL HERE'S DECLAN 
LET'S GET MORE ON THE PROFITS FROM SHELL HERE'S DECLAN 
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT'S HAPPENING 
WITH THE NEWS FROM SHELL THE OIL 
GIANT TELLING US IN THE LAST 
COUPLE OF MINUTES THAT ITS PROFITS 
HAVE GONE UP SHARPLY IT MADE A 
PROFIT OF THREE POINT NINE BILLION IN JUST 
THREE MONTHS OF TRADING THAT'S TWELVE PER CENT 
MORE THAN IT DID THIS TIME A YEAR 
AGO WE'RE ALSO EXPECTING NEWS FROM 
B. P. WITHIN THE NEXT FIFTEEN MINUTES OR SO 
IT'S ALSO EXPECTED TO TELL US THAT 
PROFITS ARE UP SHARPLY THEY'RE ALL 
GOING UP BECAUSE OF THE HIGH OIL 
PRICE ON THE WORLD MARKETS COST OF 
OIL AROUND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS A BARREL OVER THE 
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS OR CERTAINLY 
COMING CLOSE TO THAT FIGURE WHEN 
WE SPEND MONEY AT THE PUMPS WE SAY 
THAT THE PRICE OF OIL AT THE PUMPS 
IS REACHING RECORD HIGHS BUT WHEN 
WE SPEND MONEY AT THE PUMPS WHERE 
DOES THE MONEY GO THE OIL 
COMPANIES SAY THAT THEY DON'T 
ACTUALLY MAKE MUCH OF THEIR 
PROFIT 
BUYING FUEL IF WE TAKE THE 
ASSMUPTION THAT THE COST IS TEN SEVENTY NINE P. 
A LITRE THIS IS HOW THAT BREAKS 
DOWN FOR THAT AMOUNT SOME FIFTY P. OF 
THAT IS FUEL DUTY THAT'S GOING TO 
THE CHANCELLOR AS TAX THEN THERE'S 
MORE TAX ON TOP OF THAT VAT IS SIXTEEN P. 
GOING TO THE CHANCELLOR THE 
OVERALL COST OF THE OIL WHICH GOES 
BACK TO THE OIL COMPANY COMES IN AT 
THIRTY THREE P. LESS THAN A THIRD IS GOING 
BACK TO THE OIL COMPANIES 
APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRDS GOING IN 
TAX THE REMAINING NINE P. THAT'S WHAT 
THE RETAILER GETS ON THE FORECOURT 
FROM THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THE 
COST OF SHIPPING THE OIL AND 
STORING IT ONSITE RETAILERS SAY 
THEY END UP MAKING VERY LITTLE IN 
FACT IF ANY PROFIT AT ALL LET'S 
TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THIS WITH 
SIMON WARDELL AN OIL ANALYST AT 
GLOBAL INSIGHT GOOD MORNING 
THESE 
GLOBAL INSIGHT GOOD MORNING THESE AREN'T STAGGERING THESE ARE 
STAGGERING LARGE FIGURES IS IT 
DOWN TO THE HIGH PRICE 
IT IS 
PREDOMINANTLY DOWN TO THE HIGH OIL 
PRICE ALSO GAS PRICES WHEN OIL 
RISES NATURAL GAS TENDS TO FOLLOW 
THEY ARE INDEX LINKS THE 
PERFORMANCE REFLEGTS THE HIGH 
PRICES 
THEY JUST SIT BACK AND PRICES ENJOY THE MONEY 
THEY HAVE TO PLAN 
FOR THE FUTURE PLAN FOR LONG TERM 
INVESTMENTS THINK ABOUT THE PRICE 
FOR THE FUTURE AND MAKE INVESTMENTS 
BASED ON THAT 
YOU TALK ABOUT 
INVESTMENTS THERE'S AN INTERESTING 
FIGURE IN HERE ABOUT HOW MUCH IS 
BEING PRODUCED THE OIL COMPANIES 
ARE CERTAINLY PRODUCING MORE SHELL 
SAYING IT'S PRODUCING MORE THIS 
YEAR THERE'S A QUESTION OF HOW 
MUCH IS GAS AND HOW MUCH IS OIL IN IN OIL TERMS THEY'RE PRODUCING 
SLIGHTLY LESS THAN THIS TIME LAST 
YEAR N. GAS TERMS MORE THERE'S MORE 
GAS AVAILABLE THEY HAVE MORE 
ACCESS TO RESERVES THE OIL 
RESERVES ARE UNDER PRESSURE SO 
WE'RE SEEING THE PRICE HIGH WHAT'S WHAT'S KEEPING THE PRICE HIGH 
THERE'S THE 
WEAK DOLLAR AND IT'S A VERY SLIM 
SPARE CAPACITY MARGIN OPEC DOESN'T 
HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL 
OIL TO PUMP WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS 
THE SENSE OF SCARCITY IN THE MARKET 
TONE COURAGE MORE INVESTMENT TO 
CREATE MORE OIL TO CREATE A WIDER 
BUFFER 
SIMON WARDELL THANKS FOR BUFFER JOINING US WE'LL BRING YOU THE 
NEWS FROM B. P. AS SOON AS WE GET IT 
HERE PROBABLY JUST A COUPLE OF 
MINUTES MINUTES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BAD DOINGS IN

CONSIDER A DAFFODIL TO BE A WEAPON 
BUT GREEN FINGERED LAW BREAKERS ARE 
USING FLOWERS TO TRANSFORM 
NEGLECTED WASTE LANDS WE TOLD YOU 
ABOUT THE GUERRILLA GARDENERS TWO 
YEARS AGO WE'RE GOING TO SPEAK TO

TOO DESTRUCTIVE 
THE ILLICIT 
GUERRILLA GARDENER RICHARD 
REYNOLDS IS HERE NOW NICE TO SEE 
YOU ONCE AGAIN WE REMEMBER WHEN 
YOU DID THAT FOR US A COUPLE OF 
YEARS AGO WATCHING WHAT YOU WERE

FOR ME I'M AN ENTHUSIASTIC FROM GARDENER I MOVED TO A TOWER BLOCK 
IN SOUTH LONDON L. DIDN'T EVEN HAD 
HAVE A WINDOW SILL RIGHT OUTSIDE 
WERE NEGLECTED FLOWER BEDS WHICH 
COULD BE MY GARDEN AND IT WOULD BE 
SIMPLER TO DO IT MYSELF ONCE YOU 
START DOING IT YOU SEE POTENTIAL 
ALL OVER THE PLACE THAT PATCH 
THERE IS ABOUT FIVE MINUTES FROM 
ME AND IT'S FAR BIGGER THAN WHAT 
WAS OUTSIDE MY FLAT SO I MADE THAT 
MY GARDEN TOO 
HAS IT SURVIVED 
ABSOLUTELY IT'S GONE FROM STRENGTH 
TO STRENGTH THE LAVENDER THAT 
NIGHT IT'S NOW TWO YEARS OLD 
THEY'VE NEVER TAKEN IT AWAY NO NO CORRESPONDENCE 
IS THAT IT THAT'S CORRESPONDENCE THAT'S THE LAVENDER BED LAST SUMMER YOU'D YOU'D HAVE TO WIND DOWN YOUR WINDOW AS 
YOU WERE GOING PAST YOU'VE BROUGHT

GARDENING LOVELY 
PURE ILLICITLY GARDENING LOVELY GROWN LAVENDER 
NO DEALSEL IN 
THERE THERE HOW'S THE SCOPE OF GUERRILLA 
GARDENING DEVELOPED 
IT BEGAN AND 
THE TERM WAS COINED IN THE EARLY 
NINETEEN SEVENTIES IN NEW YORK OVER THERE THEY 
BUILT COMMUNITY GARDENS WHICH HAVE 
BEEN LEGITIMISED EVEN A BIT OF 
WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING HAS BEEN LE 
JIZ MITED LEGITIMISED AS WELL 
IT'S JUST GETTING OUT THERE DOING 
IT AND DEALING WITH THE 
CONSEQUENCES AFTER MOST CASES THE 
AUTHORITIES DON'T ARGUE WITH IT 
ONCE THEY SEE THE COMMITMENT AND 
TRANSFORMATION THAT PEOPLE HAVE PUT 
INTO THAT SPACE IT NOW REALLY IS 
TAKING OFF AROUND THE WORLD L. L. HAVE 
E. MAILS FROM PEOPLE IN VERY FAR 
FLUNG CORNERS SAYING HEARD ABOUT 
WHAT YOU'RE DOING THIS IS GREAT 
I'VE FOUND A PATCH I'M GOING TO 
GET GARDENING 
DO YOU HAVE ANYONE 
EVER DIGGING IT UP SAYING CAN'T DO 
THAT ROUND HERE YOU'RE DOING IT 
ILLEGALLY 
I'VE LOST TWO FLOWER ILLEGALLY BEDS ONE BECAUSE THE TOWER BLOCK 
IS NOW STANDING THERE AND ANOTHER 
BECAUSE THE ROAD JUNCTION HAS BEEN 
RECONFIGURED THIS NEGLECTED LAND 
DOES HAVE OTHER USES NO MORE OFTEN 
THAN NOT IT GOES FROM STRENGTH TO 
STRENGTH 
YOU'VE PRODUCED A BOOK STRENGTH THIS BOOK IS BOTH HISTORY OF THE 
MOVEMENT IT'S WHY WE DO IT WHAT 
WE'RE FIGHTING AGAINST AND ALSO A 
HAND BOOK FOR HOW TO DO IT AS WELL

THE TIME EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD WAS SELECTED 
BY HIM AND LOCKED IN HIS CELLAR HE 
ADMITTED TO THAT HE ALSO ADMITTED 
THAT HE PRESSURISED HER THERE BEAT 
HER THERE HE INCARCERATED HER 
AGAINST HER WILL 
IMAGINE LIVING HERE FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS IN 
THIS UNDERGROUND DUNGEON OF TINY 
CHAMBERS LOW CEILINGS WITHOUT A 
SINGLE WINDOW NEVER SEEING THE 
LIGHT OF DAY AND EXPOSED TO SEXUAL 
ABUSE THE BASEMENT WAS SAID TO BE 
SO DEEP THAT ANY CRYS FOR HELP 
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HEARD 
ELISABETH AND HER SIX SURVIVING 
CHILDREN ARE BEING CARED FOR BY NOW 
THE AUTHORITIES AUSTRIANS ASK HOW 
SUCH LONG TERM ABUSE COULD HAVE 
GONE UNNOTICED BY HIS WIFE BY THE 
POLICE SOCIAL WORKERS AND 
NEIGHBOURS THE DISCOVERY OF 
AUSTRIA'S HOUSE OF HORROR HAS 
SHOCKED AND EMBARRASSED THIS TOWN 
AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY WHEN THIS 
STORY BROKE AT THE WEEKEND MANY 
PEOPLE HERE THOUGHT IT COULD NOT BE 
TRUE IT WAS TOO TERRIFYING NOW WE 
HAVE HEARD JOSEF FRITZL'S 
CONFESSION VIA THE POLICE THE 
WHOLE HORROR OF WHAT HAPPENED IN 
THIS HOUSE BEHIND ME HAS HIT HOME 
AND CAUSED SHOCK ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
AND YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ABOUT 
THAT STORY AS IT DEVELOPS WITH B. B. C.

TWO BIG OIL COMPANIES HAVE JUST 
ANNOUNCED THEIR PROFITS THIS 
MORNING WE HEARD ABOUT SHELL 
EARLIER NOW B. P. IS IN AS WELL 
DECLAN IS AT THE STOCK EXCHANGE B. P. 
HAS MATCHED SHELL BOTH OF THE BIG 
BRITISH COMPANIES HAVE ANNOUNCED 
BUMPER PROFITS B. P. THIS IS THE 
NEWS JUST REACHING US AS I TALK TO 
YOU NOW PROFITS THERE UP FORTY EIGHT PER CENT IT 
MADE A PROFIT OF THREE POINT THREE BILLION IN 
THREE MONTHS OF TRADES THREE POINT THREE 
BILLION IN THREE MONTHS OF TRADING 
FOLLOWS ON THE NEWS FROM SHELL IT 
MADE THREE POINT NINE BILLION IN THREE MONTHS 
OF TRADING SO FOR JUST THE START 
OF THIS YEAR BOTH THOSE OIL 
COMPANIES MAKING COMBINED PROFIT 
OF SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION AGAIN FOR THREE 
MONTHS OF TRADING THAT LEAVES THEM 
ON TRACK FOR RECORD PROFITS THIS 
YEAR BEATING THEIR COMBINED TOTAL 
LAST YEAR OF TWENTY FIVE BILLION THE 
REASON THEY ARE MAKING SO MUCH 
MONEY THE OIL COMPANIES SAY IT IS 
BECAUSE OF THE RECORD HIGH OIL 
PRICES W. THE COST OF OIL CLOSE TO 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS A BARREL AS ONE ANALYST PUT 
IT TO ME THEY ARE SITTING BACK AND 
TAKING THE MONEY RESEARCHERS SAY 
THEY HAVE FOUND THE CLEAREST 
EVIDENCE YET THAT GOING TO NURSERY 
OR PLAY GROUPS HELPS PROTECT 
CHILDREN AGAINST LEUKAEMIA A 
REVIEW OF FOURTEEN STUDIES CONCLUDES 
CHILDREN EXPOSED TO INFECTIONS AT A 
YOUNG AGE HAVE A LOWER RISK OF 
DEVELOPING THE COMMONEST FORM OF 
THE DISEASE 
THESE TODDLERS ARE LEARNING TO PLAY 
TOGETHER THEY ARE ALSO 
ENCOUNTERING MORE INFECTIONS THAN 
THEY WOULD MEET AT HOME TODAY'S 
RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT MAY REDUCE 
BY THIRTY PER CENT THEIR RISK OF DEVELOPING THE 
COMMONEST FORM OF LEUKAEMIA THE 
THEORY IS THAT CHILDREN LIKE THESE 
WHO GET LOTS OF EXPOSURE TO 
INFECTION HAVE THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS 
CHALLENGED AT A VERY EARLY AGE BUT 
KIDS WHO DON'T GET THAT AND WHO 
HAVE PARTICULAR GENETIC MUTIGS 
ARE FAR MORE VULNERABLE TO GOING ON 
TO DEVELOP LEUKAEMIA 
YOU CAN BE 
CONFIDENT AND SAY TO PEOPLE SEND 
YOUR CHILDREN TO DAY CARE LET THEM 
EAT DIRT LET THEM HAVE LOTS OF 
EARLY INFECTIONS IT IS GOOD FOR 
THEM IT IS NICE TO BE ABLE TO SAY 
THOSE THINGS WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT 
OF CONFIDENCE 
PARENTS AT THIS 
GROUP ARE ALREADY KEEN TO MAKE SURE 
THEIR TODDLERS COME ACROSS LOTS OF 
BUGS 
I KEEP HER IF I KEPT HER BUGS CLOSED UP AT HOME SHE WOULD 
PROBABLY BE SICK WHEN I PUT HER 
INTO SCHOOL 
IT IS GOOD BECAUSE IF 
THEY DIDN'T AND THEY WERE FOUR WHEN 
THEY WENT TO SCHOOL THEN THEY WOULD 
GET IT HARDER 
CHILDHOOD LEUKAEMIA 
IS A COMPLICATED CONDITION WITH 
SEVERAL CAUSES RADIO HIGH VOLTAGE 
POWER LINES AND TRAFFIC POLLUTION 
MAKING SURE YOUR TODDLERS ENCOUNTER 
LOTS OF INFECTIONS MAY JUST BE ONE 
WAY TO PREVENT IT 
ONE OF SADDAM HUSSEIN'S LEADING 
MINISTERS GOES ON TRIAL IN BAGHDAD 
TODAY ON CHARGES CONNECTION WITH 
THE EXECUTION OF FORTY PEOPLE IN THE 
NINETEEN NINETIES ADS AZIZ WAS ONE OF THE 
PUBLIC FACES OF THE SADDAM REGIME 
HOLDING POSITIONS SUCH AS FOREIGN 
MINISTER AND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER 
NOW THE STRIKING WORKERS AT 
GRANGEMOUTH OIL REFINERY IN 
SCOTLAND ARE NOW RETURNING TO WORK 
AT THE END OF OF THEIR FORTY EIGHT HOUR 
STOPPAGE THE STRIKE HAS DISRUPTED 
FUEL SUPPLIES AND BROUGHT HALF OF 
THE NORTH SEA OIL PRODUCTION TO A 
HALT LET'S GET THE LATEST FROM OUR 
CORRESPONDENT WHO IS IN GRANGEMOUTH 
FOR US THEY WERE BEHIND YOU NOW 
THEY ARE NOT THEY HAVE CLEARLY 
GONE IN THOSE STRIKING WORKERS 
WHAT HAS THE MOOD BEEN LIKE THEY THEY HAVE STARTED GOING BACK INTO WORK 
IT HAS BEEN A VERY QUIET DISPUTE IN 
TERMS OF THE SITUATION AROUND THE 
VARIOUS GATES AROUND GRANGEMOUTH 
OVER THE PAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS IT HAS BEEN 
A VERY BITTER DISPUTE THE TWO 
SIDES AT LEAST ON THE SURFACE 
APPEARING AS FAR APART AS EVER OVER 
THESE NEGOTIATIONS OVER WHAT 
HAPPENS TO THE FINAL SALARY PENSION 
SCHEME BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS 
THAT THERE IS A CHANCE OF SOME 
MOVEMENT ON TALKS WITH UNITE 
OFFICIALS MEETING THE OWNER OF THIS 
PRIVATE COMPANY LATER TODAY 
TELL US WHAT THE EFFECTS OF THE 
TWO DAY WALKOUT HAVE BEEN IN TERMS 
OF COSTS TO THE ECONOMY 
IT HAS HAD 
A SUBSTANTIAL COST TO THE ECONOMY 
SHUTTING DOWN THE PIPELINE HAS 
MEANT OILFIELDS HAVE HAD TO SHUT 
DOWN IT HAS COST FIFTY MILLION A DAY 
ABOUT ONE MILLION AN HOUR IN TERMS 
OF TAX THEN OF COURSE THERE HAS 
BEEN SOME PETROL SHORTAGES 
RATIONING AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT 
OF ADDITIONAL FUEL BEING SHIPED 
FROM THE CONTINENT THE SITUATION 
ON THE FORECOURT IS GETTING BACK TO 
NORMAL THE PIPELINE COULD TAKE 
ABOUT A DAY TO SWITCH BACK ON THE 
REFINERY ITSELF COULD TAKE UP TO A 
WEEK GORDON BROWN AND ALEX SALMOND 
HAD A MEETING LAST NIGHT TO DISCUSS 
THIS CRISIS AND OF COURSE ON HOW 
THIS DISPUTE CAN BE RESOLVED 
THANK YOU AUSTRALIAN SCIENTISTS 
MAY HAVE DISCOVERED A WAY THAT 
PEOPLE CAN LOSE WEIGHT WITHOUT 
HAVING TO CUT BACK ON HOW MUCH THEY 
EAT RESEARCHERS FOUND BY 
MANIPULATING FAT CELLS IN MICE THEY 
WERE ABLE TO SPEED UP THE ANIMAL'S 
MET TABISM AND MAKE THEM BURN MORE 
CALORIES SCIENTISTS SAY IT COULD 
DEVELOP DRUGS TO ASSIST WEIGHT LOST 
THOUSANDS OF OLD BUILDINGS COULD BE 
AT RISK BECAUSE OF SHORTAGE OF 
SPECIALIST WORKERS MAINTENANCE OF 
HISTORIC BUILDINGS HAS BEEN FALLING 
BEHIND ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL 
HERITAGE TRAINING GROUP WHILE THE 
SHORTAGE OF STONE MASONS AND DRY 
STONE WALLERS HAS EASED THERE ARE 
STILL NOT ENOUGH CRAFTS PEOPLE 
MILEY CYRUS THE STAR OF HANNAH 
MONTANA HAS APOLOGISED FOR 
APPEARING HALF NAKED SHE SAID SHE 
THOUGHT THE PICTURES FOR VANITY 
FAIR WERE GOING TO BE ARTISTIC SHE 
SAID WHEN SHE SAW THEM SHE FELT 
EMBARRASSED HERE IS THE PICTURE IN 
FULL IN THE DAILY MAIL THIS MORNING 
THAT IS WHAT SHE NORMALLY LOOKS 
LIKE THIS IS WHAT SHE LOOKS AFTER 
AFTER THE PHOTOGRAPH THIS IS WHAT 
YOU WOULD NOT THINK SHE IS THE SAME 
PERSON 
SHE IS SO YOUNG AND PERSON PROJECTS A WHOLESOME IMAGE 
IT IS 
VERY SUGGEST SIEVE IN A WAY HER HER PARENTS AND MINDERS WERE THERE 
VANITY FAIR OBVIOUSLY DELIGHTED 
WITH IT THEY THINK IT IS A 
GORGEOUS PHOTO BUT OTHER PEOPLE 
PERHAPS THE DISNEY CHANNEL NOT 
HAPPY AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE NOW NOW IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE HOW 
ANYBODY COULD COPE PHYSICALLY AND 
MENTALLY WITH BEING IMPRISONED IN 
YOUR OWN HOME FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS THAT 
CASE INVOLVING JOSEF FRITZL AND HIS 
DAUGHTER RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT 
WHAT CAN NOW BE DONE TO HELP THEM 
RECOVER WE HAVE THE CLINICAL 
PSYCHOLOGYIST SIMON MEYERSON IN THE 
STUDIO WHEN WE SAY IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO IMAGINE LOCKED UP UNDERGROUND 
FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS WITH YOUR FATHER 
SEXALLY ABUSING YOU AND BRINGING UP 
SIX CHILDREN L. MEAN HOW ON EARTH 
WOULD ANYONE BE ABLE TO RECOVER 
FROM THAT COULD THEY EVER RECOVER 
FROM THAT 
WELL IT IS A MOST 
HORRIFIC SCENARIO ON THE EXTREME 
RANGE OF THE SERIAL WORK BUT YES 
THEY CAN RECOVER THERE WOULD BE A 
LOT OF WORK REQUIRED PARTICULARLY 
ON THE MOTHER OF THE SEVEN KIDS 
THEY WOULD HAVE TO CONCENTRATE A 
LOT ON HER AND WHAT SHE HAS GONE 
THROUGH AND THE OLDEST DAUGHTER THE 
ONE WHO CAUSED THE WHOLE THING TO 
COME TO THE SURFACE BY GOING TO THE 
HOSPITAL BY BEING QUESTIONED BY AN 
ACUTE PER ACCEPTIVE DOCTOR IN THE 
HOSPITAL IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR 
HIM IT MIGHT HAVE CONTINUED UNTIL 
WHEN WE DON'T KNOW BUT THE WORK 
CAN BE DONE AND IT WILL BE THEY 
HAVE TO HAVE A PLACE OF SAFETY AND 
SAN KNITTY AND SLOW WORK ON THEM 
BUT FORTUNATELY THEY ARE A FAMILY 
AND THE THREE THAT HAVE BEEN OUT 
WILL SORT OF WELCOME THE OTHERS AND 
THERE'LL BE A FAMILY REUNION THERE 
WOULD HAVE TO ABANDON THE PREMISES 
WHERE THEY ARE IT WILL HAVE TO BE 
A COMPLETELY NEW PLACE 
THAT IS THE 
EXTRAORDINARY THING SHE HAD SEVEN 
CHILDREN ONE DIED THREE WERE WITH 
HER AND THREE BROUGHT UP BY HER 
FATHER AND HER MOTHER L. MEAN HOW 
ON EARTH CAN YOU GET THAT FAMILY 
BACK TOGETHER FOR THOSE THREE 
CHILDREN LOOKED AFTER BY JOSEF 
FRITZL TO THINK OF THE WOMAN WHO 
HAD BEEN DOWN STAIRS THEY HAD 
NEVER SEEN HER 
THE MOTHER OF THE 
SEVEN KIDS THE DAUGHTER WHO IS 
THE MOTHER I DON'T KNOW IF THE 
MOTHER IS THIS IF THE MOTHER IS 
THEIR SISTER IT IS A TERRIBLY 
CONFUSING THING BUT THEY HAVE BEEN 
TOGETHER AND THEY WILL BE TOGETHER 
AND THEY WILL SURVIVE IT L. AM 
WORRIED ABOUT THE MOTHER IN THE 
SENSE A LOT OF WORK WILL HAVE TO BE 
DONE WITH HER AND THEN THE DAUGHTER 
WHO IS IN A COMA IN HOSPITAL NOW A 
LOT OF WORK WILL HAVE TO BE DONE ON 
HER 
WHEN YOU SAY A LOT OF WORK HER WHERE WOULD YOU START 
A PLACE OF 
SAFETY WORKING INDIVIDUALLY WITH 
THEM WITH THE FAMILY BRINGING 
NORMALITY THEY MAY HAVE TO HAVE A 
TIME OF ANONYMITY SO THAT THEY 
DON'T STAY SUBJECT TO RIDICULE OR 
SELF CONSUSSNESS OR DAILY REMINDING 
SO THERE MIGHT BE A NEW SCENARIO 
NATASCHA KAMPUSCH SURVIVED IT THE 
AUTHORITIES DID PROVIDE A VERY GOOD 
SERVICE IN THIS CASE BECAUSE IT 
IS INVOLVED WITH THE NATIONAL 
IDENTITY IT WILL BE EXTRAORDINARY 
GOOD 
IF YOU HAVE THREE CHILDREN GOOD WHO HAVE LIVED UNDERGROUND FOR 
THEIR WHOLE LIVES THE LITTLE BOY 
APPARENTLY WAS JUST VERY EXCITED TO 
BE ON A CAR HE HAD SEEN THEM ON A 
TELEVISION BECAUSE THERE WAS ONE IN 
THE CELLAR BUT THEY HAVE NOT 
EXPERIENCED REAL LIFE THAT IS 
SOMETHING YOU WOULD INTRODUCE YOU 
WOULD HAVE TO INTRODUCE IT SLOWLY 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO PROTECT THEM YOU 
WOULD NOT THROW THEM OUT THERE 
THEY WOULD HAVE A PROTECTED SLOWLY 
INTERACTING ENVIRONMENT L. THINK 
FORTUNATELY THE TELEVISION WOULD 
HAVE HAD A GOOD AFFECT IT WOULD 
HAVE HELP THEM TO FEEL WHAT IS 
OUTSIDE 
LIKE A WINDOW ON THE WORLD OUTSIDE THANK YOU 
LOTS OF COVERAGE OF THAT STORY 
THANK YOU LOTS OF COVERAGE OF THAT STORY 
THE SUN HAS FOUR PAGES OF COVERAGE 
THERE AS TO HOW IT COULD HAVE 
WORKED WITH THE PLAN OF THE HOUSE 
ALSO A PICTURE OF THE DAUGHTER 
ELIZABETH AS SHE WAS BEFORE SHE WAS 
IMPRISONED 
SHOW US THE FRONT PAGE IMPRISONED IF YOU LOOK AT THESE PICTURES HE'S 
EVEN PROVIDED LITTLE RUGS TO GO 
THROUGH FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER IN 
THIS TINY CORRIDOR IF YOU LOCK AT 
THE DETAIL AND STUCK THINGS ON THE 
WALLS THE FACT THAT THEY LIVED 
THERE FOR SO LONG SHE LIVE THRD 
FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS IS JUST ASTONISHING 
SOMEONE TOLD ME THAT THE ENTRANCE 
TO THE LAIR WAS VIATE GARAGE BUT I 
HAVEN'T SEEN GARAGE IN ANY OF THE 
PICTURES IF IT WAS A GARAGE IT'S 
EASY TO DRIVE IN AND GO SHOPPING 
FOR THE KIDS AND CLOTHES 
AND MAKE 
IT SEEM NORMAL 
WITHOUT ANYONE ELSE 
SEEING 
OTHER STORIES IN THE PAPERS SEEING GORDON BROWN IN THE MAIL IT SAYS IS 
TO TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
TOUGHENING OF LAW ON CANNABIS HE 
WILL ANNOUNCE THAT HE WANTS IT TO 
BE A CLASS B. STATUS DRUG WE'VE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT B. P. PROFITS UP THIRTY THREE

BRIGHTER IN THE NORTH OF WALES 
AROUND HOLYHEAD AS WE SWEEP

BRIGHTER SPELLS AND SHOWERS SO THE 
SHOWERS CONTINUE THROUGH THE COURSE 
OF THE DAY SOME OF THEM SLOW 
MOVING HEAVY DOWN POURS WITH THE 
HAIL AND THUNDER THE RAIN SWINGS 
IN ACROSS MUCH OF THE SOUTH OF 
ENGLAND SOUTHERN WALES AND 
EVENTUALLY IT GETS INTO CENTRAL 
ENGLAND AS WELL AS EAST ANGLIA IT 
FEELS COLD IF YOU'RE UNDER THE RAIN 
BAND THROUGH THIS EVENING AND 
OVERNIGHT THE RAIN BAND CONTINUES

PARTS OF ENGLAND AS WELL IN 
BETWEEN THERE WILL BE LOT OF 
SHOWERS SOME OF THEM MERGING 
HEAVIER DOWN POURS WITH HAIL AND 
THUNDER THE MESSAGE IS TAKE YOUR 
BROLLY BECAUSE YOU'RE PROBABLY 
GOING TO NEED IT THAT'S HOW IT'S 
LOOKING 
LOOKING LOOKING NICE FOR THE WEEKEND THOUGH 
WE'RE HEAD TO NORTHUMBERLAND NOW TO 
GO PUFFIN SPOTTING WITH THEIR 
RAINBOW BILLS AND DISTINCTIVE 
PLUMAGE YOU WOULD IMAGINE THEY'D 
BE EASY TO SPOT AND COUNT 
BUT CONSERVATIONISTS CARRYING OUT 
SENSE US HAVE FOUND THE SEA BIRDS 
NOT AS FRIENDLY AS THEY LOOK DANNY 
SAVAGE IS AT SEA HOUSES HARBOUR AT 
A SAFE DISTANCE ARE YOU 
GOOD MORNING FROM A BEAUTIFUL 
PERFECT MORNING ON THE COAST OF 
NORTHUMBERLAND YOU CAN SEE THE 
GOLDEN SANDS BEHIND ME AND THE 
DISTINCTIVE OUTLINE OF BANBOROUGH 
CASTLE THE REASON WE'RE HERE THIS 
MORNING ARE THE ISLANDS COUPLE 
OF MILES OFF THE COAST ACROSS 
FLAT AND CALM NORTH SEA THIS 
MORNING THE FARNE ISLANDS HOME TO 
THOUSANDS OF SEA BIRDS AT THIS TIME 
OF YEAR THEY HAD A DISASTROUS 
SUMMER LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF THE 
WEATHER WORST AFFECTED WERE THE 
PUFFINS THE WARDENS HERE ARE 
HOPING FOR BETTER THINGS THIS YEAR 
THEY ARE AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS 
THE CLOWNS OF THE AIR THEIR BRIGHT 
BILLS INQUIZTIVE LOOKS AND FUNNY 
WALK MAKE PUFFINS FIRM FAVOURITE 
OF VISITORS TO BRITAIN'S SEA BIRD 
COLONIES EVERY FIVE YEARS HERE ON 
THE FARNE ISLANDS THERE'S A HEAD 
COUNT NOT EASY WHEN THEY ALL LOOK 
THE SAME AND KEEP MOVING 
WE HAVE 
DIVIDING POINTS FROM PREEF IOUS 
SURVEYS 
THE COUNTERS SAY THERE'S A SURVEYS REAL VALUE TO THE SURVEY 
IT'S VERY 
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE PUFFINS ARE 
AN ENVIRONMENTAL BAROMETER FOR THE 
FARNE ISLANDS COUNTING THE 
POPULATION WE CAN SEE AFTER EVERY 
FIVE YEARS IF THEY'RE DOING WELL 
OR IF THEY'RE DOING BAD IF SO THE 
REASONS BEHIND THAT 
PUFFINS NEST 
IN BURROWS WHERE EACH PAIR RAISES 
A SINGLE CHICK TO GET AN ACCURATE 
POPULATION COUNT THE LONG ARM OF 
THE WARDEN COMES CALLING WE'LL WE'LL RING A SMALL NUMBER OF BIRDS DURING 
A SEASON AND THIS WILL BRING THEM 
OUT AND CHECK THEIR BODY WEIGHT AND 
BODY MASS AND RING THE BIRD AND PUT 
IT BACK 
THE RESULTS SO FAR THIS 
YEAR ARE ENCOURAGING IF THE PUFFIN 
NUMBERS ARE ON THE INCREASE IT'S 
GOOD NEWS FOR THE OTHER BIRDS TOO 
SUCH AS THIS RAZOR BILL BECAUSE IT 
MEANS THAT THERE'S PLENTY OF FOOD 
IN THE SEA TO SUPPORT THE TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF BIRDS THAT LIVE HERE 
THROUGHOUT THE SPRING AND SUMMER 
IT'S THE PUFFINS THAT DRAW THE 
CROWDS 
A 
MOST COMICAL BIRD AND CROWDS MOST LIKEABLE BIRD 
THEY DO FUNNY 
ANTICS AND HOP AROUND WHICH IS 
VERY ENDEARING THEY'RE LOVELY 
LITTLE THINGS 
EXPERTS HOPE TO COUNT SIXTY THOUSAND PAIRS 
BREEDING ON THIS COLONY IN THE 
COMING WEEKS 
THAT'S TEN THOUSAND MORE BIRDS THAN THERE 
WERE HERE FIVE YEARS AGO BUT THE 
WARDENS SAY THEY'RE THANKFUL THEY 
ONLY HAVE TO DO THIS ONCE EVERY 
FIVE YEARS BECAUSE STICKING THEIR 
ARMS DOWN THE BURROWS THEY GOT LETS 
OF SCRATCHES AND BIRDS FROM THE 
PUFFINS WHO ARE OBVIOUSLY 
DEFENSIVE WHEN SOMEBODY RUMAGES 
AROUND IN THEIR NESTS THIS IS NOT 
THE SITUATION ELSEWHERE ON THE 
BRITISH ISLES THERE'S KOLNILZ 
WHERE NUMBERS ARE GOING DOWN IT'S 
ALL DOWN TO THE SUPPLY OF FOOD IN 
THE SEA LUCKILY THERE'S PLENTY OF 
IT HERE IF YOU WANT TO SEE MORE

GAMES LEFT A SEMI FINAL A HOME

WIGAN AWAY DISASTER 
OH MISSED 
THE BEST BIT THERE WEST BROM NIDGE 
ALBION HAVE ALL BUT CLINCHED THEIR 
PLACE BACK IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
NEXT SEASON A ONE TO ONE DRAW AGAINST 
SOUTHAMPTON MEANS THAT ONLY A 
CRICKET SCORE BY HULL IN THEIR 
FINAL GAME OF THE SEASON WOULD 
OVERHAUL WEST BROM'S GOAL 
DIFFERENCE DIFFERENCE WEST BROM RESPONDED WITH AN 
QUALLISER FROM CHRIS BRUNT AND THAT 
GOAL ALL BUT SENDS THEM UP FOR THE 
THIRD TIME IN SEVEN SEASONS THE 
BAGGIES ARE READY TO PARTY ARSENAL

CRICKET BOARD SAY THEY FELT LET 
DOWN RONNIE O'SULLIVAN TRULY LIVED 
UP TO HIS NICKNAME THE ROCKET AT 
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS IN

ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN BREAK IT WAS A MAXIMUM BREAK 
OF O'SULLIVAN'S CAREER AND ONLY THE 
SEVENTH IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS HE HAS ALREADY 
SCORED THREE OF THOSE IT MEANS 
THAT RONNIE WILL NOW PLAY LIANG 
WENBO IN THE QUARTER FINALS HE 
ALSO PICKED UP A CHECK FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND 
WHEN I GOT TO THE FIRST BIT I 
THOUGHT YOU HAVE TO GO FOR THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO WIN THE 
GAME ONE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE HUNDRED SIX THOUSAND GIVES ME 
MORE CHOICES IN THE SUMMER L. CAN 
GET MY BENTLEY CONVERTIBLE HAVE 
BEEN DIEING TO GET ONE 
THERE IS 
THE BLACK WELL DONE HIM IT ONLY 
TOOK HIM NINE MINUTES AND FORTY FIVE 
SECONDS HIS FASTER IS FIVE MINUTES 
AND THIRTY SECONDS L. HAVE GOT TO BRING 
AUP STORY FROM THE TIMES YESTERDAY 
HE SAID HIS DAD HAS THE WORLD 
RECORD FOR THE WORST SNOOKER SHOT 
HE SAYS HIS DAD NOT ONLY MISSED A 
RED HE MISSED THE RED AND AS HE 
TRIED TO CHALK UP THE SCORE BOARD 
HE LIFTDED UP THE CUE BROUGHT DOWN 
THE LIGHT ON THE SNOOKER TABLE L. THINK WE CAN ALL RELATE TO THAT 
NOW VOTERS IN ENGLAND AND WALES GO 
TO THE POLLS ON THURSDAY IT OF 
COURSE IS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
ELECTIONS HERE ON BREAKFAST WE 
HAVE SPOKE ON THE ALL THE MAIN 
PARTIES AHEAD OF THAT VOTE TODAY 
IT IS THE TURN OF LABOUR WE ARE 
JOINED BY HARRIET HARMAN NICE TO 
HAVE YOU WITH US BUT I CANNOT HELP 
WONDERING WHERE THE PRIME MINISTER 
IS 
HE IS MEETING MINISTERS BEFORE IS WE HAVE THE CABINET MEETING 
GETTING ON WITH THE BUSINESS OF 
GOVERNMENT 
WE'VE HAD THE LEADERS GOVERNMENT OF THE CONSERVATIVES HERE ONE 
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WITH LABOUR UP 
AGAINST IT A BIT IN THESE ELECTIONS 
THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WOULD WANT 
TO FIGHT HIS CORNER MORE PUBLICLY 
WE ARE TEAM HE HAS SENT ME ALONG 
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS TODAY AND 
TALK ABOUT WHAT OUR LABOUR 
COUNCILLORS ARE STEPPING UP TO THE 
PLATE FOR 
THE MAIN QUESTION IS YOU 
ARE PRETTY MUCH UP AGAINST THIS 
AREN'T YOU 
I DON'T THINK IT IS 
RIGHT TO BE PREDICTING WHAT WILL 
HAPPEN WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT OUR 
COUNCILLORS ARE WORKING VERY HARD 
ON BEHALF OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES 
WHETHER IT IS THE NEW SHOPPING 
CENTRE IN NUN EATEN I AM GOING TO 
BE VISITING LATER ON TODAY OR JUST 
THE ZEBRA CROSSING THATLY MEET UP 
WITH A COUNCILLOR WHO HAS A NEW 
ZEBRA CROSSING IN HER AREA THE 
FIRST THING I WANTED TO SAY 
LEAVING ASIDE THAT OBVIOUSLY WE 
WANT PEOPLE TO VOTE LABOUR BUT THE 
MOST IMPORTANT THING I THINK IS 
THAT PEOPLE GO OUT AND VOTE IN 
COUNCIL ELECTIONS WHETHER IT IS 
TRANSPORT OR IT IS HOUSING OR 
WHETHER IT IS NEIGHBOURHOOD WARDENS 
THESE ARE VERY 
PEOPLE OFTEN FOCUS ON A 
GENERAL ELECTION THEY FORGET ABOUT 
THE REALLY IMPORTANT COUNCIL 
SERVICES 
PEOPLE TEND TO VOTE IT SERVICES IS OFTEN A BAROMETER ABOUT HOW 
PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT IN 
GENERAL PEOPLE FEEL BAD ABOUT 
LABOUR AT THE MOMENT ACCORDING TO 
THE POLLS THEY FEEL NOT GOOD ABOUT 
THE WAY THE ECONOMY IS GOING FOOD 
PRICES RISING FUEL GOING UP THE 
U. TURN OVER THE TEN PER CENT TAX RATE THAT 
DISCUSSION NOT OVER YET THE 
GOVERNMENT HERE HAS NOT GOT A GRIP 
HAS IT 
I AM NOT NECESSARILY SURE 
IT IS THE CASE THAT PEOPLE JUST 
VOTE ON NATIONAL ISSUES THIS IS 
NOT A PROXY FOR A GENERAL ELECTION 
THERE ARE ELECTIONS IN WALES THERE 
ARE ELECTIONS IN LONDON FOR THE 
MAYOR AND ELECTIONS IN ENGLISH 
COUNCILS SO ALL OF THEM L. HAVE 
BEEN AROUND THE COUNTRY CAMPAIGNING 
YOU CAN SEE DIFFERENT ISSUES BEING 
RAISED ON THE DOORSTEP AS FAR AS 
THE GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED I THINK 
I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PEOPLE HAVE GOT 
UNCERTAINTIES THERE ARE 
DIFFICULTIES PEOPLE ARE WORRIED 
ABOUT RISING PRICES IF YOUR 
SHOPPING BILL FOR FOOD IS GOING UP 
YOU ARE WORRIED EVEN IF THE PRICE 
OF CLOTHES AND ELECTRICAL GOODS IS 
COMING DOWN THERE ARE 
UNCERTAINTIES GLOBALLY IN THE 
FINANCIAL SITUATION BUT OUR JOB AS 
GOVERNMENT IS NOT TO LOOK OVER OUR 
SHOULDER AT OPINION POLLS BUT TO 
BE GETTING ON WITH THE BUSINESS OF 
TRYING TO MAKE BRITAIN BETTER OFF 
SAFER HEALTHIER AND THAT IS WHAT 
WE WILL BE DOING 
YOU DON'T THINK 
THAT PEOPLE WILL VOTE ON HOW THEY 
FEEL ABOUT THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
AND THE PRIME MINISTER IN 
PARTICULAR ESPECIALLY AFTER THE 
COMMENTS WE HAD FROM LORD LEVY AT 
THE WEEKEND WHO SAID THAT HE SAID 
HE COULD NOT BEAT DAVID CAMERON 
TONY BLAIR SAID THAT WAS NOT HIS 
VIEW WHAT HE WAS NOT TONY BLAIR'S 
VIEW I THINK WE SHOULD DISREGARD 
THAT IT IS NOT FOR ME TO TELL 
VOTERS WHAT ISSUES THEY SHOULD VOTE 
ON BUT I KNOW THAT WHAT IS 
IMPORTANT IN THIS LOCAL COUNCIL 
ELECTIONS OR FOR THE MAYOR OF 
LONDON ELECTIONS IS BUSES AND 
TRAINS AND WHETHER THERE IS 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THAT AREA OR 
WHETHER THE SCHOOLS ARE BEING 
REBUILT AND DOING AS WELL FOR THE 
PUPILS AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN THOSE 
ARE THE ISSUES THESE ARE VERY 
IMPORTANT ISSUES FOR PEOPLE TO BE 
VOTING ON AT LOCAL ELECTS 
HAS THE 
ROW OVER THE TEN P. TAX RATE BEEN 
RESOLVED YET THE GOVERNMENT 
COMMITTED A FAMOUS U. TURN LAST WEEK 
YET FRANK FIELD AND OTHER 
BACKBENCHER SAYING THEY ARE NOT 
SATISFYED THAT THE COMPENSATION 
WILL WORK OUT ADEQUATELY 
WE ARE 
ALWAYS CONCERNED WE WANT TO DO MUCH 
BETTER ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE WHO 
PERHAPS DO HAVE TO STRUG TOLL MAKE 
ENDS MEET WHETHER IT IS PENSIONERS 
WE HAVE MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO 
PENSIONERS OR FAMILIES WITH YOUNG 
CHILDREN OR JUST SINGLE PEOPLE 
WORKING HARD SO I THINK THAT 
ACROSS THE PIECE WE HAVE DONE A 
GREAT DEAL TO HELP PEOPLE ON LOWER 
INCOME LEVELS WE HAVE GOT TO DO 
MORE THAT IS WHY THE CHANCELLOR 
AND HIS TEAM OF MINISTERS IN THE 
TREASURY ARE GOING TO BE WORKING UP 
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE GOT A 
FAIR TAX SYSTEM AS WE REDUCE YOUR YOUR BACKBENCHERS ARE NT CONVINCED IT IT IS RIGHT THEY ALWAYS WANT TO SEE US 
DO MORE 
WE HAVE A STRONG RECORD OF TACKLING 
POVERTY AND SUPPORTING PEOPLE ON 
LOW INCOMES TWO OF THE MOST 
IMPORTANT THINGS IS TO MAKE SURE 
PEOPLE HAVE JOBS TO GO TO THAT WE 
RUN AN ECONOMY IN SUCH A WAY THAT 
THERE ARE JOBS AND THAT WE KEEP 
PRICES DOWN 
HAVE YOU MADE A 
CALCULATION OR HAS ONE BEEN MADE 
AS A WHOLE FOR HOW BAD THE DAMAGE 
COULD BE FOR YOUR PARTY AT THESE 
LOCAL ELECTIONS 
THE WAY WE LOOK AT 
IT IS WHETHER PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY 
HAVING A BETTER STANDARD OF LIVING 
AGAINST A BACKGROUND WHERE PRICES 
HAVE GONE UP FOR PETROL ANDESLE L. 
MEAN YOU KNOW OUR REAL CONCERN WE 
ARE IN GOVERNMENT WE HAVE A JOB TO 
DO OUR CONCERN IS NOT TO LOOK OVER 
OUR SHOULDER AT SOMETHING WHICH 
MIGHT HAPPEN IN A GENERAL ELECTION 
IN SOME YEARS TIME THIS IS NOT 
ABOUT US THIS IS ABOUT THE JOB 
THAT WE HAVE GOT THE PRIVILEGE OF 
BEING IN GOVERNMENT 
YOU ARE 
APPREHENSIVE ABOUT IT 
I AM NOT 
APPREHENSIVE WE KNOW WHAT WE WANT 
TO DO WE WANT TO SEE BETTER PUBLIC 
SERVICES WE WANT TO SEE A STRONG 
ECONOMY WE WANT SOCIETY TO BE 
FAIRER IS WHAT WE ARE DOING TO MAKE 
SURE WE CAN DO SURE EVERYTHING 
DOES NOT WORK OUT PERFECTLY ALL THE 
TIME WE HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF 
WHAT WE WENT INTO GOVERNMENT TO DO 
THANK YOU OF COURSE THE RESULTS 
FROM THE LOCAL ELECTIONS IN ENGLAND 
AND WALES AND THE LONDON MAYORAL 
ELECTIONS WILL BE ON BREAKFAST ON 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AS WELL WE ARE 
NOT EXPECTING ALL THE RESULTS 
NORMALLY WE GET THEM ON FRIDAY 
MORNING BUT THEY ARE GOING TO 
BLEED OVER THE WEEKEND THIS IS 
BREAKFAST TWO BIG OIL COMPANIES 
HAVE ANNOUNCED HUGE PROFITS THIS 
MORNING B. P. MADE THIRTY THREE BILLION AND 
SHELL THREE POINT NINE BILLION 
THE MAN WHO IMPRISONED HIS OWN 
DAUGHTER IN BASEMENT FOR TWENTY FOUR Y. O. R. S. 
WILL FACE FURTHER QUESTIONING BY 
AUSTRIAN POLICE COMING UP LATER 
HERE ON THE PROGRAMME THE PLANTING 
WHICH CAN MAKE SMILES GROW WE WILL 
MEET A GUERRILLA GARDENER 
HERE IS OUR OWN GUR LILLE LA 
GUERRILLA GARDENER IT IS WET HERE 
IN LONDON SHOWERS CONTINUING THAT 
IS THE PICTURE ACROSS MANY PARTS OF 
THE COUNTRY TODAY HEAVY SHOWERS 
SOME WITH HAIL SOME WITH THUNDER 
AND LIGHTNING EMBEDDED IN THEM 
UNLIKE YESTERDAY THEY WILL BE SLOW 
MOVING WE WILL GET A GOOD DELUGE 
WHEN THEY COME DOWN FOR MANY OF US 
WE WILL MISTHEM WHAT WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT INBETWEEN THE 
SHOWERS THERE'LL BE SUNSHINE AROUND 
THAT WILL NOT FEEL TOO BAD 
PLES PLEASANT IN THE LIGHT WINDS 
YOU CAN SEE THE RADAR PICTURE 
WHERE WE'VE HAD THE SHOWERS DURING 
THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT BUT WE ARE 
NOW LOOKING AT HEAVY RAIN SWEEPING 
IN ACROSS THE ISLES OF SCILLY AND 
MOVING INTO THE TIP OF CORNWALL 
FOR SCOTLAND THERE IS A LOT OF 
CLOUD AROUND AGAIN SOME SHOWERS 
BREAKS AND BRIGHTER SUNNY SPELLS 
THE NORTH OF ENGLAND A LOT OF 
CLOUD WITH SOME SHOWERS THE 
SHOWERS SPORADIC AT THIS STAGE 
FURTHER SOUTH SOME BREAKS AGAIN IN 
THE CLOUD SOME SUNSHINE BUT SOME 
SHOWERS AS WE HAVE WITNESSED HERE 
IN LONDON SOME OF THE SHOWERS ARE 
POKEY THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND 
SEEING SHOWERS AHEAD OF THE RAIN 
BAND BY NINE HUNDRED A M. THIS IS WHERE WE 
EXPECT THE RAIN THROUGH CORNWALL 
AND DEVON NOT QUITE IN WALESS AT 
THIS STAGE SHOWERS IN THE SOUTH 
MUCH BRIGHTER IN THE NORTH OF WALES 
FOR NORTHERN IRELAND SHOWERS AS 
WELL INTERSPERSED WITH BRIELGT OR 
SUNNY SPELLS SHOWERS CONTINUING 
THROUGH THE DAY THE RAIN BAND WILL 
DO THE SAME THING IT WILL CONTINUE 
TO PUSH ACROSS THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND 
IN THROUGH SOUTHERN WALES 
EVENTUALLY IT WILL REACH SOUTHERN 
ENGLAND AND EAST ANGLIA IF YOU ARE 
STUCK UNDER THE RAIN BAND OR THE 
HEAVY SHOWERS YOU WILL NOTICE IT 
DOES FEEL CHILLY THEN THROUGH THIS 
EVENING AND OVERNIGHT THE RAIN BAND 
CONTINUES TO MOVE STEADILY NORTH 
IT IS MOVING AROUND AN AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE PIVOTING INTO WALES AND 
THE SOUTH WEST 
BY TOMORROW IT WILL PUSH ACROSS THE 
REST OF SCOTLAND AND STILL AFFECT 
WESTERN WALES ALSO INTO THE SOUTH 
WEST OF ENGLAND IT MAY CLIP 
EASTERN PARTS OF NORTHERN IRELAND 
WHERE IT IS NOT RAINING THERE'LL BE 
SHOWERS SOME OF THEM WILL MERGE 
HEAVIER DOWN POURS WITH HAIL AND 
THUNDER SOME GOOD NEWS SATURDAY 
IS LOOKING BRIGHTER WELL A LOT 
BROIGTER FOR MANY PARTS OF THE 
BRITISH ISLES 
BRIGHTER FOR MANY PARTS OF THE 
BRITISH ISLES 
TIME TO TALK TO DECLAN 
BIG PROFITS AT BOTH SHELL AND B. P. 
THOSE COMPANIES TELLING US WITHIN 
THE LAST HOUR OR SO THAT BETWEEN 
THEM THEY MADE PROFIT OF SEVEN POINT TWO 
BILLION IN JUST THREEF MONTHS OF 
BUSINESS BOTH COMPANIES SAY THEY 
HAVE MADE THESE HUGE PROFITS 
BECAUSE OF THE HIGH VALUE OF THE 
COST OF OIL ON THE WORLD MARKETS 
BARREL OF OIL TOUCHING SOME ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS A 
BARREL THE PRICE HAS BEEN RISING 
AT THE BUMP OF COURSE WHERE DOES 
THE MONEY ACTUALLY GO WHEN WE SPEND 
IT ON THE PETROL FORECOURT THE OIL 
COMPANIES SAY THEY DON'T MAKE MUCH 
PROFIT AT THIS END OF THE BUSINESS 
AT ALL IT'S ALL MADE FURTHER UP 
THE PIPELINE TAKING AN ASSMUPTION 
OF A PRICE OF LITRE OF PETROL 
ASSUMING IT'S ONE OH SEVEN P. OVER FIFTY P. IS ON 
FUEL DUTY THAT'S TAX THAT GOES TO 
THE CHANCELLOR THEN ANOTHER BIT OF 
TAX ON VAT TWO THIRDS OF THE PRICE 
GOES TO NUMBER ELEVEN DOWNING STREET 
THEN THIRTY TWO P. IS THE COST THAT THE OIL 
COMPANIES GET MORE THE OIL THAT 
THEY SELL TO US AS PETROL THAT 
LEAVES NINE P. FOR THE PETROL RETAILERS 
THE PEOPLE ON THE FORECOURT FROM 
THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THE COST 
OF SHIPPING AND TRANSPORTING AND 
STORING THE PETROL AS WELL RICHARD 
HUNTER IS WITH ME FROM HARGREAVES 
LANSDOWN STOCKBROKERS GOOD MORNING 
BIG PROFITS FROM THE OIL COMPANIES 
THEY SAY IT'S DOWN TO THE HIGH OIL 
PRICE TRUE OR FALSE ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY IT'S A TAIL WIND THAT'S WORKED IN 
THEIR FAVOUR THIS TIME WHAT IT 
MASKS IS THE FACT THAT THE LIKES OF 
B. P. AND SHELL HAVE HAD A 
PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT YEAR OR SO 
THEY'VE HAD PROBLEM WITH ALASKAN 
PIPES WITH THE TEXAS REFINER 
THUNDER HORSE PLATFORM ETC NOT 
NECESSARILY AS EFFICIENT GETTING 
THE OIL OUT OF THE GROUND 
DIFFICULT YEAR 
OF COURSE HOW HOW MUCH WOULD THEY MAKE IF IT WASN'T 
DIFFICULT 
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IN DIFFICULT B. P. IS INEFFICIENCY LOOK AT THE 
SHARE PRICE OFF OVER TWENTY PER CENT THAT'S 
DIFFICULT ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE AN 
INVESTOR 
THEY'RE MAKING THIS HUGE INVESTOR PROFIT BECAUSE OF THE HIGH PRICE OF 
OIL THERE WILL BE MOTORISTS WHO 
WILL LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE PAYING AT 
THE PUMP AND ASK AN OBVIOUS 
QUESTION WHICH IS IF YOU'RE MAKING 
SO MUCH PROFIT WHY NOT JUST CUT THE 
COST OF PETROL WHY NOT ABSORB THAT 
COST AND GIVE MOTORISTS A BREAK 
YOU KNOW I CAN ONLY BASICALLY SAY 
WHAT THE OIL COMPANIES WOULD SAY 
AND THAT IS PRETTY MUCH THEY RUN 
THE FORECOURTS FAIRLY FLAT AT A 
VERY VERY SMALL PROFIT DEPENDING 
ON THE OIL PRICE OF COURSE 
SOMETIMES AT A SMALL LOSS THE FACT 
OF THE MATTER IS THEY ARE 
EXTRACTING OIL IN COUNTRIES WHERE 
OFTEN THE STATE IS WANTING AN 
INCREASING PAYMENT FOR THEM TO BE 
ABLE TO EXPLORE THEY HAVE TO 
NEWLOVE OIL IT'S FINITE RESOURCE 
THERE'S FIND NEW OIL THESE ARE 
MASSIVE COMPANIES THE PETROL PART 
OF THEIR BUSINESS IS QUITE SMALL ONE 
THERE'S ASS THE ARGUMENT THAT ONE IF YOU HAVE THE BIT OF SHELL OR B. P. 
THAT TAKES THE OIL OUT OF THE 
GROUND ISN'T PASSING IT DIRECTLY TO 
SHELL AND B. P. PETROL STATIONS THERE 
ARE BITS IN THE MIDDLE WHERE THE 
MARKET OPERATES FOR COMPETITIVE 
REASONS 
YOU'RE RIGHT THAT'S THE REASONS COST OF GETTING THE OIL OUT OF THE 
GROUND NOTWITHSTANDING THOSE 
PROFITS THE PROFIT MARGIN FOR 
GETTING THE OIL OUT OF THE GROUND 
IS HALVED IN THE LAST YEAR THANKS THANKS FOR TALKING TO YOU 
MORE AFTER EIGHT A M. 
THANK YOU DECLAN 
NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE 
COMPUTER GAME WHICH LOOKS SET TO

ORGANISING A PARTY CAN BE

I WASN'T SURE WHETHER I WAS GOING

THAT I COULD DO UNLIT IN L. DIDN'T 
KNOW WHAT PEOPLE WOULD BE LIKE 
ABOUT OPENING THEIR PLACES UP L. 
GUESS IN MY HEAD I THOUGHT THEY'RE 
NOT GOING TO BE INTO IT IT WAS 
QUITE DIFFICULT BUT EXACTLY THE 
SAME AS THE STATES PEOPLE ARE 
REALLY OPEN YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND 
THE RIGHT PEOPLE 
LET'S HAVE LOOK AT THE WEATHER 
WITH MATT 
TAYLOR GOOD MORNING IT'S 
A BIT CHILLY THIS MORNING BEFORE 
YOU HEAD OUT THE DOOR MAKE SURE YOU 
HAVE SOMETHING WATER PROOF WITH YOU 
THERE WILL BE RAIN AT TIMES AGAIN 
THIS MORNING A SCATTERING OF 
SHOWERS SOME DRY WEATHER IN 
BETWEEN THE SHOWERS AROUND LUNCH 
TIME MOST PLACES WILL BE DRY BUT 
IT WON'T LAST LONG DURING THE 
AFTERNOON WE'LL SEE THICKER CLOUD 
SPREADING FROM THE SOUTH AND 
SPELL OF STEADY AND QUITE HEAVY 
RAIN AT TIMES IN STIFF SOUTH TO 
SOUTH EASTERLY WIND MAKING IT FEEL 
COOLER THAN TWELVE THIRTEEN CELSIUS WOULD 
SUGGEST THAT RAIN LASTS FOR A TIME 
DURING THE EVENING CLEARS TO THE 
NORTH IT'S DRY THEN FOR WEE 
WHILE BEFORE WE SEE MORE SHOWERS 
PUSH IN SOME OF THOSE BY WEDNESDAY 
MORNING COULD BE HEAVY AND THUNDERY 
IT'S ANOTHER SHOWERY DAY ON 
WEDNESDAY LITTLE CHANGES DURING 
THURSDAY AS THE SHOWERS EASE DOWN 
ON FRIDAY AND INTO THE WEEKEND IT 
SHOULD TURN WARMER THAT'S ALL FOR 
NOW 
THIS IS BREAKFAST BUMPER PROFITS 
ANNOUNCED BY TWO OF THE BIGGEST OIL 
COMPANIES BETWEEN THEM B. P. AND 
SHELL MADE MORE THAN SEVEN BILLION IN 
JUST THREE MONTHS OF BUSINESS 
GOOD MORNING ALSO AFTER THE 
CONFESSION OF MORE QUESTIONS 
AUSTRIANS ASKED HOW WOMAN CAN BE 
HIDDEN FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS WITHOUT ANYONE 
KNOWING MIXING IT UP WITH OTHER 
CHILDREN COULD HELP YOUR TODDLER 
AVOID LEUKAEMIA 
I'M AFRAID WE COULDN'T HEAR DANNY 
SAVAGE THERE COUNTING PUFFINS IN 
NORTHUMBERLAND IT'S NOT EASY AND 
THE LEGEND OF BILLIE HOLIDAY 
MICHAEL BRANDON BRINGS TO LIFE THE 
STORY OF LADY DAY GOOD MORNING TO 
YOU TWO BIG OIL COMPANIES HAVE 
ANNOUNCED HUGE PROFITS B. P. MADE 
THREE POINT THREE BILLION AND SHELL THREE POINT NINE BILLION 
THAT IN JUST THREE MONTHS THEY ARE 
HUGE NUMBERS THERE 
IT IS BUT NOT UNEXPECTED THE OIL 
COMPANIES ARE MAKING THAT AMOUNT OF 
PROFIT BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF 
OIL ON THE WORLD MARKETS WITH A 
BARREL OF OIL COMING CLOSE TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS 
APIECE IT'S NO WONDER THAT THESE 
COMPANIES ARE MAKING THESE BIG 
PROFITS THE OIL COMPANIES SAY THAT 
WHEN YOU ARE FILLING UP AT THE PUMP 
WHEN YOU ARE PUTTING FUEL INTO YOUR 
CAR AND ARE LOOKING AT THE PRESS 
THAT YOU ARE PAYING FOR PETROL AND 
DIESEL THAT IS NOT THE REASON THAT 
THEY ARE MAKING THESE HIGH PROFITS 
THEY STRESSED THAT MOST OF THE 
MONEY WE PAY AS MOTORISTS GOES TO 
THE CHANCELLOR IN TAX THEY ARE 
RIGHT AND THAT ASSERTION SIXTY SIX PER CENT OF 
EVERYTHING YOU PAY AT THE PETROL 
PUMP GOES TO THE CHANCELLOR IN TAX 
PETROL RETAILERS SAY THEY MAKE 
BARELY ANY MONEY IN PROFIT AT ALL 
FROM SELLING PETROL SO WHERE IS 
THIS HUGE PROFIT COMING FROM IT 
COMES MUCH FURTHER UP THE PIPELINE 
THEY MAKE THEIR PROFIT AT THE POINT 
WHERE THEY TAKE THE OIL OUT OF THE 
GROUND AND BEFORE THEY SEND IT TO 
THE REFINERY IF THAT'S SO WHY 
DON'T THEY SIMPLY ABSORB THE PAIN 
THEMSELVES AND CUT THE PRICE OF 
PETROL AT THE PUMP THE REASON THEY 
CAN'T DO THAT IS BECAUSE THAT WOULD 
BE ANTI COMPETITIVE AND WOULD PUT 
B. P. AND SHELL OWNED PETROL STATIONS 
AT A DISADVANTAGE TO PETROL 
STATIONS OWNED BY INDEPENDENT 
RETAILERS AND OWNED BY THE 
SUPERMARKETS AS WELL SO THOSE BIG 
PROFITS ARE LOCKED IN AT THE START 
OF THE PIPELINE AND THEN THEY 
CARRY ON ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE 
END IT LEAVES MOTORISTS PAYING 
HIGH PRICES AT THE PUMP GORY 
ACTION ON THAT STORY THROUGHOUT THE 
MORNING AS THOSE OIL COMPANIES 
WERE PUBLISHING THEIR PROFITS TWELVE HUNDRED 
WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN ON STRIKE AT 
THE GRANGEMOUTH OIL REFINERY NEAR 
EDINBURGH STARTED WORKING 
RETURNING TO WORK AFTER THEIR FORTY EIGHT AT 
A STOPPAGE THE STRIKE HAS 
DISRUPTED FUEL SUPPLIES AND FOR 
ALMOST HALF OF THE U. K.'S NORTH SEA 
PRODUCTION OF OIL TO A HALT TELL 
US AS THE WORKERS ARE BACK IN THE 
BUILDING WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF THE 
FORTY EIGHT HOUR STRIKE 
THERE ARE STILL 
SOME LOCALISED SHORTAGES IN 
SCOTLAND BUT THERE HAVE BEEN 
ADDITIONAL TANKERS OUT ON THE ROAD 
AT THE SUPPLYING THOSE DAMAGES AND 
ADDITIONAL FUEL HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN 
FROM THE CONTINENT THOSE SHIPS 
DOCKING YESTERDAY AND THIS MORNING 
IN THE FIRTH OF FORTH THE REASON 
FOR THAT IS BECAUSE IT WILL TAKE 
SOME DAYS FOR THE REFINERY TO COME 
BACK ON LINE THAT THEY WILL NEED 
TO HAVE THAT ADDITIONAL FUEL IN 
POSITION OF COURSE THE FORTIES 
PIPELINE WAS SHUT DOWN AND THAT HAS 
COST THE ECONOMY ARE FIFTY MILLION A 
DAY ABOUT A MILLION POUNDS AN HOUR 
IN LOST TAX REVENUE THERE HAS SOME 
HARD WORK GOING ON TO BRING THESE 
TWO SIDES TOGETHER THEY'RE GOING 
TO GET AROUND THE NEGOTIATING TABLE 
AGAIN SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE UNION 
ARE MEETING JIM RATCLIFFE THE 
OWNER OF INEOS THE COMPANY WHICH 
OWNS GRANGEMOUTH LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON IN LONDON POLICE IN 
AUSTRIA WILL CONTINUE TO QUESTION A 
PENSIONER WHO CONFESSED TO 
IMPRISONING HIS DAUGHTER IN A 
CELLAR AND FATHERING SEVEN CHILDREN 
THE FORTY TWO YEAR OLD WOMAN AND THE SIX 
SURVIVING CHILDREN ARE BEING CARED 
FOR BY THE AUTHORITIES STILL A 
SENSE OF SHOCK AND BEWILDERMENT 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED 
A YES ABSOLUTELY THE QUESTION 
THAT EVERYONE IS ASKING IS HOW IS 
THIS POSSIBLE HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE 
THAT IN THIS SMALL SLEEPY AUSTRIAN 
TOWN FATHER COULD KEEPER'S 
DAUGHTER LOCKED UP A TWENTY FOUR YEARS IN 
THE HOUSE BEHIND ME SEXUALLY 
ABUSED HER AND NO ONE KNEW ABOUT 
IT NEITHER THE WIFE OF THE MAN WHO 
WAS LIVING UPSTAIRS THE NEIGHBOURS 
THE POLICE OR THE SOCIAL SERVICES 
THAT ASTONISHMENT IS REFLECTED IN 
SOME OF THE NEWSPAPER HEADLINES 
TODAY THIS HAS HEADLINE IS ONE 
CONFESSION BUT ONE THOUSAND QUESTIONS 
OTHER NEWSPAPERS REFLECT THE DRAMA 
OF WHAT HAPPENED THIS HEADLINE IS 
THE DUNGEON THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER IN 
AMSTETTEN ITS HEADLINE IS 
AMSTETTEN IN SHOCK BUT IT'S NOT 
ONLY THIS TOWN WHICH IS IN SHOCK 
IT'S THE WHOLE OF AUSTRIA UNDER 
ARREST THE AUSTRIAN PENSIONER WITH 
A TERRIFYING SECRET A TWENTY FOUR YEARS 
JOSEF FRITZL HAD KEPT HIS OWN 
DAUGHTER ELIZABETH LOCKED UP IN 
THE HIDDEN BASEMENT OF THE FAMILY 
HOME HELD PRISONER HERE FROM THE 
AGE OF EIGHTEEN SHE WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED 
BY HER FATHER IN THE CELLAR SHE 
GAVE BIRTH TO SEVEN OF HIS CHILDREN 
ONE OF THEM DIED JOSEF FRITZL 
DISPOSED OF THE BODY BY BURNING IT 
HIS DAUGHTER AT THE 
TIME EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD WAS SELECTED BY 
HIM AND LOST IN HIS LOCKED IN HIS 
CELLAR HE ADMITTED TO THAT IT 
ALSO ADMITTED THAT HE PRESSURISED 
EVENT PETER HE INCARCERATED HER 
AGAINST HER WILL 
IMAGINE LIVING 
HERE FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS IN THIS 
UNDERGROUND DID DUNGEON OF TINY 
CHAMBERS LOW CEILINGS WITHOUT A 
SINGLE WINDOW NEVER SEEN THE LIGHT 
OF DAY AND EXPOSED TO SEXUAL ABUSE 
THE BASEMENT IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN 
SO DEEP THAT ANY CRIES FOR HELP 
SIMPLY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HEARD 
ELISABETH FRITZL AND HER SIX 
SURVIVING CHILDREN ARE BEING CARED 
FOR BY THE AUTHORITIES AUSTRIANS 
ARE ASKING HOW SUCH LONG TERM ABUSE 
COULD HAVE GONE UNNOTICED BY JOSEF 
FRITZL'S WIFE THE POLICE SOCIAL 
WORKERS AND BY NEIGHBOURS THE 
DISCOVERY OF AUSTRIA'S HOUSE OF 
HORROR HAS SHOCKED AND EMBARRASSED 
THIS TOWN AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY 
WHAT IS THE LATEST ON ELISABETH 
AND A SIX SURVIVING CHILDREN 
CALLS WE BELIEVE THAT THREE OF 
THOSE CHILDREN WHO SPENT ALL THEIR 
LIVES IN THAT CELLAR ARE RECEIVING 
MEDICAL CARE IN HOSPITAL HER 
ELDEST DAUGHTER KIRSTEN IS VERY 
SERIOUSLY ILL WE BELIEVE SHE HAS 
LOST CONSCIOUSNESS AND IS ON A 
VENTILATOR RESEARCHERS SAY THEY 
HAVE FOUND THE CLEAREST EVIDENCE 
YET THAT GOING TO NURSERY OR 
PLAYGROUPS HELPS PROTECT CHILDREN 
AGAINST LEUKAEMIA A REVIEW OF 
FORTEAN STUDIES CONCLUDES THAT 
CHILDREN WHO ARE EXPOSED TO 
INFECTION THAT A YOUNG AGE AT A 
LOWER RISK OF DEVELOPING THE THIS 
FORM OF THE DISEASE THESE TODDLERS 
ARE LEARNING TO PLAY TOGETHER BUT 
THEY ARE ALSO ENCOUNTERING MANY 
MORE INFECTIONS THAN THEY WOULD 
MEET AT HOME AND TODAY'S RESEARCH 
SUGGESTS THAT MAY REDUCE BY THIRTY PER CENT 
THEIR RISK OF DEVELOPING THE COMMON 
AS A FORM OF LEUKAEMIA THE THEORY 
IS THAT CHILDREN LIKE THESE YOU GET 
LOTS OF EXPOSURE TO INFECTION HAVE 
THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS CHALLENGE AT A 
VERY EARLY AGE BUT KIDS YOU DON'T 
GET THAT AND TO HAVE A PARTICULAR 
GENETIC MUTATION ARE FAR MORE 
VULNERABLE TO GOING ON TO DEVELOP 
LEUKAEMIA 
YOU CAN BE QUITE LEUKAEMIA CONFIDENT AND SAY TO PEOPLE SEND 
YOUR CHILDREN TO DAY CARE LET 
LET THEM HAVE LOTS OF 
EARLY INFECTIONS IT'S GOOD FOR 
THEM IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO SAY 
THOSE THINGS WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT 
OF CONFIDENCE 
PARENTS AT THIS 
GROUP ARE ALREADY KEEN TO MAKE SURE 
THEIR TODDLERS COULD COME ACROSS 
LOTS OF DOGS 
I KEEP HER CLOSE TO 
AT HOME THEN SHE WOULDN'T SHE 
WOULD PROBABLY BE VERY SICK WHEN I 
DO PUT HER INTO SCHOOL 
I THINK IT 
IS GOOD BECAUSE IF THEY DIDN'T AND 
THEY ARE FOUR YEARS OLD AND GO TO 
SCHOOL THEN THEY'RE GOING TO GET 
IT HARDER 
CHILDHOOD LEUKAEMIA IS A 
COMPLICATED CONDITION OF SEVERAL 
POSSIBLE CAUSES INCLUDING 
RADIATION HIGH VOLTAGE POWER LINES 
AND TRAFFIC POLLUTION BUT MAKING 
SURE YOUR TODDLER'S ENCOUNTER LOTS 
OF INFECTIONS MAY JUST BE ONE WAY 
OF HELPING PREVENT IT ONE OF 
SADDAM HUSSEIN'S LEADING MINISTERS 
GOES ON TRIAL IN BAGHDAD TODAY ON 
CHARGES CONNECTED WITH THE 
EXECUTION OF AROUND FORTY PEOPLE IN 
THE NINETEEN NINETIES HE WAS ONE OF THE PUBLIC 
FACES OF THE SADDAM HUSSEIN REGIME 
HOLDING POSITIONS SUCH AS FOREIGN 
MINISTER AND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER 
AUSTRALIAN SCIENTISTS MAY HAVE 
DISCOVERED A WAY THAT PEOPLE CAN 
LOSE WEIGHT WITHOUT HAVING TO CUT 
BACK ON WHAT THEY EAT RESEARCHERS 
IN MELBOURNE FOUND THAT BY 
MANIPULATING FAT CELLS IN MICE THEY 
WERE ABLE TO SPEED UP THE ANIMALS 
METABOLISM AND MAKE THEM BURN MORE 
CALORIES THE SCIENTISTS SAY THE 
TECHNIQUE COULD BE USED TO DEVELOP 
DRUGS TO ASSIST WEIGHT LOSS 
THOUSANDS OF OLD BUILDINGS COULD BE 
AT RISK BECAUSE OF SHORTAGE OF 
SPECIALIST WORKERS MAINTENANCE OF 
HISTORIC PREMISES LIKE BUCKINGHAM 
PALACE AND WINDSOR CASTLE HAS BEEN 
FALLING BEHIND THAT'S ACCORDING TO 
THE NATIONAL HERITAGE TRAINING 
GROUP IT SAYS THAT WHILE THE 
SHORTAGE OF DONATIONS THATCHERS 
AND DRY STONE WALL AS HAS EASED 
THERE IS STILL NOT ENOUGH SKILLED 
CRAFTSPEOPLE TO MEET THE DEMAND 
THE FIFTEEN YEAR OLD STAR OF THE DISNEY 
CHANNEL SHOW HANNAH MONTANA HAS 
APOLOGISED TO HER FANS WERE 
APPEARING HALF NAKED IN A MAGAZINE 
PHOTO SHOOT SHE SAID SHE THOUGHT 
THE CONTROVERSIAL PICTURES FOR 
VANITY FAIR MAGAZINE WERE GOING TO 
BE ARTISTIC THEN WHEN SHE SAW THEM 
SHE SAID SHE FELT EMBARRASSED 
LET'S HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT 
ANNIE LEIBOVITZ THE MAGAZINE SAYS 
THEIR ARTISTIC BUT THE PROBLEM IS 
THE SHEET THE SHEET SUGGESTS THE 
BEDROOM HER MOTHER AND HER TEACHER 
HER GRANDMOTHER AND HER TEACHER 
WERE BOTH THERE THEY SAID THEY 
WERE HAPPY WITH IT THE DISNEY 
CHANNEL ARE VERY UNHAPPY WITH IT 
UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD YOU 
NORMALLY SEE SOMEBODY LIKE THAT 
CAN I READ YOU AN E. MAIL FROM A FAN 
OF HER L. SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH 
THE PHOTOGRAPH OF HER L. THINK WE 
SHOULD THANK HER FOR LETTING US SEE 
HER IN THAT WAY THE PHOTOGRAPHER 
HAS MADE TO SEEM VULNERABLE AND HAD 
LIKE THAT'S THAT HOW SHE IS 
NORMALLY PORTRAYED IT'S HIGHLY 
ARTISTIC AND THAT PHOTOGRAPHER 
PROBABLY HAD VERY GOOD REASONS FOR 
SHOWING HER THIS WAY SHE IS ONLY 
SHOWING HER BACK HOW CAN PEOPLE BE 
OUTRAGED IT'S BEAUTIFUL BUT YOU 
WOULDN'T LET YOUR FIFTEEN YEAR OLD DO IT 
WOULD YOU DISTRESSING DISEASE THAT 
AFFECTS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED CHILDREN EVERY 
YEAR IN THE U. K. LITTLE IS KNOWN 
ABOUT WHAT CAUSES LEUKAEMIA BUT WE 
HAVE BEEN TELLING YOU ABOUT A 
REPORT WHICH IS OUT THIS MORNING 
SUGGESTING THAT CHILDREN WHO GO TO 
NURSERY ARE BETTER PROTECTED 
AGAINST DEVELOPING THE DISEASE 
LET'S FIND OUT HOW AND TALK TO 
EDWARD FROM THE CHARITY CHILDREN 
WITH LEUKAEMIA DOCTOR ROSEMARIE HAS 
JOINED US WHAT ARE THE FACTS 
BEHIND THIS 
THE FACTS ARE THAT IT 
DOES SEEM THAT CHILDREN WHO HAVE 
CONTACT WITH OTHER CHILDREN IN 
SOCIAL GROUPS ARE VERY EARLY ON IN 
LIFE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE AGE 
WANT TO TWO YEAR OLDS HAVE A 
SLIGHTLY LOWER RISK OF GETTING 
LEUKAEMIA THAN THOSE WHO ARE MORE 
ISOLATED HOWEVER IT IS ONLY A 
MINOR EFFECT AND I WOULD HATE ANY 
PARENT WHO HAS HAD A CHILD WITH 
LEUKAEMIA TO THINK IT'S MY FAULT 
I DIDN'T TAKE THEM TO A PLAYGROUP 
THIS IS ONE OF ONE MINOR FACTOR 
THE EXACT CAUSE OF LEUKAEMIA IS NOT 
KNOWN BUT IT'S PROBABLY THAT YOU 
HAVE A GENETIC PREDISPOSITION AND 
THEN THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL FACTOR 
OF HAVING AN INFECTION EARLY ON IN 
LIFE GETTING MINOR INFECTIONS 
SOMEHOW CHANGES YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM 
AND MAKES YOU LESS LIKELY TO GET 
THE KEY HERE 
THIS IS A STUDY OF 
STUDIES IT'S NOT A LOCAL STUDY ON 
ITS OWN IT JUST LOOKED AT OTHER 
PEOPLE'S FIGURES 
THAT'S RIGHT 
YOU'RE TALKING TO THE SCIENTIST 
EARLIER AND SHE SAID SHE HAS TAKEN 
FOURTEEN OF THE LARGEST STUDIES IN THE 
WORLD AND POLLED THE RESULTS OF 
THOSE SHE HAS THAT EVER STUDY OF 
TWENTY THOUSAND CHILDREN WE CAN PROBABLY BE 
MORE CONFIDENT THAN EVER BEFORE 
THAT THERE IS SOMETHING TO DO WITH 
WHAT CHILDREN DO IN THE MONTHS OF 
THEIR LIVES UNDER THE YEARS WHICH 
IS PROVIDING A PROTECTIVE EFFECT 
FROM THAT WE CAN WORK OUT A BETTER 
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT REALLY CAUSED 
HIS CHILDHOOD LEUKAEMIA THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THEY MIGHT BE DOING OR 
EXPOSED TO IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS 
OF THEIR LIFE THE SUGGESTION IS 
THAT BY MIXING WITH OTHER CHILDREN 
THEY ARE BUILDING UP THEIR IMMUNE 
SYSTEM DOES THAT REALLY HELP 
PROTECT YOU AGAINST CHILDHOOD 
ILLNESSES 
WE ARE MORE CONFIDENT OF ILLNESSES THAT THAN EVER BEFORE WE CAN NEVER 
BE CERTAIN OF THESE THINGS BUT IT'S 
AN ASSERTION WE HAVEN'T FOUND THE 
MECHANISM YET BUT WHAT REALLY 
EXPLAIN OF ALL THE HYPOTHESES IT 
FITS BEST THAT'S WHY THE 
SCIENTISTS ARE SAYING IT THE GOOD 
IDEA TO MIX YOUR CHILDREN THE THE FACTS ARE BORNE OUT THAT A THIRTY PER CENT 
REDUCTION IN RISK FOR THOSE WHO ARE 
SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE DISEASE IS NO 
SMALL THING 
YES BUT I DON'T THING 
YOU SHOULD PUT A TIED IN A 
PLAYGROUP JUST TO TRY TO HELP 
PREVENT A KEEN EAR IT'S A GOOD 
THING FOR THEM ON LOTS OF DIFFERENT 
FRONTS LEUKAEMIA WE KNOW THAT 
GETTING LOTS OF INFECTIONS EARLY ON 
IN LIFE AND BEING EXPOSED TO DO IT 
CHILDREN GROWN UP IN FARMYARDS WHO 
WERE EXPOSED TO THE VETERANS GO FAR 
FEWER ALLERGIES IT DOES SEEM THAT 
THE MODERN IMMUNE SYSTEM NEEDS TO 
BE CHALLENGED PARTICULARLY WHEN 
YOU ARE LITTLE TO ME TO DEVELOP 
PROPERLY IT'S A GOOD THING FOR 
YOUR CHILD TO GO TO A PLAYGROUP L. 
KNOW A LOT OF CHILDREN FIND THAT 
WHEN THEIR CHILDREN'S DAMAGING 
MIXING SOCIALLY BIGGER ONE COLD 
AFTER ANOTHER AND THEY ARE OFTEN 
INTO THE SURGERY SAYING WHY IS 
THIS IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE BEING 
EXPOSED TO THEM IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD 
FOR CHILDREN TO GET INFECTIONS AND 
COLDS 
WE WERE TALKING EARLIER COLDS ABOUT THAT STUDY THAT SAY YOU 
SHOULD LET YOUR CHILDREN HAVE DOGS 
AND PETS BECAUSE THAT DEVELOPS 
THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM LET'S GO BACK 
TO LEUKAEMIA ARE PEOPLE BORN WITH 
A CANCER GENE HOW MUCH DO WE KNOW 
ABOUT WHY CHILDREN 
OR THERE ARE 
TWO ASPECTS OF CHILDHOOD LEUKAEMIA 
SOMETHING HAPPENS BEFORE A CHILD IS 
BORN IT'S USUALLY NOT PRESENT IN 
EITHER PARENT THAT MEANS THAT NINETY NINE PER CENT 
OF CHILDREN JUST CAN'T GET 
LEUKAEMIA WHEN WE LOOK AT THE 
GUTHRIE SPOT THE PINPRICK OF BLOOD 
THAT HAS TAKEN FROM THE HEEL OF A 
NEWBORN BABY THERE IS SOMETHING 
THERE WHICH BRIDGE CLUB GOING ALL 
THE CHILDREN WHO HAVE GOT LEUKAEMIA 
ANDERSON SHOW AND HAS A CAN'T GET 
LEUKAEMIA AFTER CHILDREN ARE BORN 
THERE IS ONE OF A NUMBER OF 
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS 
WHICH CAN TRIGGER LEUKAEMIA WE 
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE LEUKAEMIA LEUKAEMIA MAY ALREADY BE THERE BUT IT WILL BE 
TRIGGERED BY VARIOUS THINGS THE THE POTENTIAL FOR LEUKAEMIA BUT MOST 
OF THE CHILDREN WHO HAVE THE 
POTENTIAL DON'T GET THE KENIA 
MAYBE ONLY ONE PER CENT OF THEM IT COULD BE 
DIET NUTRITION TRAFFIC POLLUTION 
ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS IT TO BE A 
WHOLE HOST OF THINGS INFECTION HAS 
A PROTECTIVE EFFECT WHICH IS A 
REALLY USEFUL PIECE OF EVIDENCE 
STILL TO COME WE WILL CATCH UP 
WITH EIGHT GUERILLA GARDENER WHO 
HAS BEEN PLANTING SEEDS OF CHANGE 
IN THAT URBAN JUNGLE MANJU MALHI 
WILL BE TELLING US WHY SHE IS 
PERSUADING INDIANS TO TRY 
SHEPHERD'S PIE AND FISH AND CHIPS 
IN BRITAIN SHE WANTS US TO COOK 
MORE CURRY 
I AM ON THE FAR ISLANDS 
OFF THE COAST OF WHERE THERE 
ARE COUNTING 
TO SEE HOW 
MANY PUFFINS THERE ARE BUT THEY 
ARE 
GOOD MORNING AS YOU CAN SEE IT IS 
POURING BUCKETS FOR MANY PARTS OF 
THE COUNTRY THAT IS THE FORECAST 
HEAVY SHOWERS WITH HAIL AND THUNDER 
AND LIGHTNING THROWN IN FOR GOOD 
MEASURE UNLIKE YESTERDAY THE 
SHOWERS WILL BE SLOW MOVING TWELVE 
HOURS AGO THIS WAS OF THE SCENARIO 
YOU CAN SEE SOME RAIN WHICH IS 
CURRENTLY SHOWING ITS HAND RAIN IS 
STILL HANGING ON BY THE SKIN OF ITS 
TEETH IN THE FAR NORTH OF SCOTLAND 
SOME BREAKS IN THE CLARET FURTHER 
SOUTH ALLOWING SOME SUNSHINE THE 
SHOWERS ARE NEVER GOING TO BE TOO 
FAR AWAY WE HAVE GOT BIG LINE OF 
THEM AS WE HEAD TOWARDS THE 
MIDLANDS AND THE ISLE OF WIGHT AND 
GENERALLY TOWARDS THE SOUTH WE 
EXPECT THE RAIN TO BE MAKING GOOD 
PROGRESS ACROSS MUCH OF CORNWALL 
AND DEVON THERE ARE SOME SHOWERS 
AND BRIGHTER SPELLS FOR NORTHERN 
IRELAND THE SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE 
THROUGH THE DAY THE RAIN BAND WELL 
ADVANCED ADVANCE ACROSS MUCH OF 
ENGLAND AND THE SOUTHERN HALF OF 
WALES IF YOU ARE STUCK UP UNDER 
THE RAIN BAND THE TEMPERATURE WILL 
DROP QUITE SHARPLY STUCK UNDER 
THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT THE 
RAIN BAND WILL PUSH STEADILY 
NORTHWARDS AS IT MOVES INTO THE 
NORTH OF ENGLAND AND EASTERN 
SCOTLAND YOU CAN SEE HOW IT GOES 
BACK DOWN ACROSS WALES AND THE 
SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND THAT RAIN 
BAND WILL MOVE ACROSS THE REST OF 
SCOTLAND TOMORROW AND POSSIBLY CLIP 
EASTERN PARTS OF NORTHERN IRELAND 
IN BETWEEN WE ARE LOOKING AT AGAIN 
A LOT OF SHOWERS SOME OF THEM ARE 
MERGING WITH THE RISK OF HAIL AND 
THUNDER WHEREVER YOU ARE HEADING 
MAKE SURE YOU TAKE YOUR BROLLY 
THAT IS IT 
BEHIND EVERY GREAT BUSINESS 
EXECUTIVE THERE IS GREAT 
SECRETARY HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU ASK 
YOUR ASSISTANT TO DO FOR YOU IT IS 
O. K. FOR HIM OR HER TO ASK YOU TO 
FETCH CUP OF COFFEE WHAT YOU SAY 
NO IF THEY ASKED YOU TO PICK UP 
YOUR DRY CLEANING IS IT O. K. TO ASK 
YOUR SECRETARY TO FETCH SHOPPING OR 
SEND CHAMPAGNE TO YOUR WIFE OR 
HUSBAND VICTORIA HAS WORKED AS AN 
EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT AND JO CAMERON 
WAS A FORMER APPEARED ON THE 
APPRENTICE EXECUTIVE ASSISTANCE 
ARE VERY INVOLVED MORE WITH THE 
BUSINESS 
A SECRETARY MIGHT JUST BE BUSINESS DOING COPY AND AUDIO TYPING STUFF 
LIKE THAT 
DO YOU GET ASKED TO DO 
WEIRD PERSONAL THINGS FOR YOUR 
BOSS 
I AM HAPPY TO SAY THIS IS NOT BOSS ABOUT MY CURRENT EMPLOYER YOU YOU WOULD SAY THAT 
IN EVERY POSITION 
THERE WAS ONE PARTICULAR BOSS I AM 
GOING BACK A FEW YEARS HE WAS AN 
INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEUR WHEN HE 
WAS IN LONDON WE WOULD BE DOING 
THINGS LIKE SETTING THE AIR 
CONDITIONING IN HIS APARTMENT TO A 
CERTAIN TEMPERATURE STOCKING HIS 
FRIDGE WITH A READY MEALS AND 
DRIVING HIS CAR ROUND THE BLOCK 
UNTIL WE GOT A SPECIFIC SPOT 
OUTSIDE THE BUILDING SHE SHINING 
REPAIRING TROUSERS I HAVE PROBABLY 
DONE IT SUE 
ALAN SUGAR IS SCARY 
ISN'T HE YOU HAVE A SECRETARY I I DO INDEED 
SOMETIMES THE LINE GETS 
A BIT BLURRED BETWEEN WORK AND 
PERSONAL STAFF L. ALWAYS 
ACKNOWLEDGED ACKNOWLEDGE WHEN SHE 
DOES IT MY P. A. IS FABULOUS AND SO 
INVALUABLE DOES SHE MANAGE YOUR 
LIFE AS WELL 
SHE DOES THAT BUT I 
ALWAYS RECOGNISE THAT SHE DOES THAT 
I THINK BUSINESS PRIORITIES ALWAYS 
COME FIRST IF YOU ARE ABLE TO TAKE 
SOME OF THE PERSONAL WORK FROM YOUR 
BOSS IT ENABLES THEM TO 
CONCENTRATE ON THE BUSINESS THERE 
ARE TWO SIDES TO THE ARGUMENT HAVE HAVE YOU EVER SAID NO 
ON OCCASIONS MY 
CURRENT BOSS IS SO FANTASTIC THAT I 
DO NOT MIND WE HAVE GOT THE 
PERFECT BALANCE OF WORK AND 
PERSONAL BUSINESS 
GWENDA SAYS COME 
UP MY BOSS BROUGHT HIS SHIRTS TO MY 
HOME TO THE EYE O. K. OR NOT O. K. 
GOING INTO THE HOME IS TAKING ITS A 
BIT FAR 
THE HOUSE KEEPER AT THE 
HOTEL HAD NOT AT HEAT TWO 
INSTRUCTIONS ON GETTING ITS EIGHT FEB 
THEIR PILLOW SORTING OUT THINGS AT 
HOME AND WHEN YOU ARE ON HOLIDAY 
FEDAK 
I'M SURE MY P. A. HAS PROBABLY FEDAK DONE SOME OF THOSE THINGS WHEN YOU 
ARE RUNNING A BUSINESS AND YOU HAVE 
GOT AMBITIONS AND GOALS YOU NEED 
PEOPLE TO HELP YOU WITH THOSE 
THINGS ARE YOU GET A BIT OF A

ROUGH RIDE IT'S NOT FOR THE LIGHT 
HEARTED THIS IS THE TRUE STORY OF 
A VERY TALENTED WOMAN SHE WAS A 
PROSTITUTE SHE WAS A DRUNK A DRUG 
ADDICT BUT SHE WAS ALSO ONE OF THE 
MOST TALENTED JAZZ SINGERS THE 
WORLD'S EVER KNOWN L. THINK 
PROBABLY SHE WAS THE FIRST TO TAKE 
LYRIC AND MUSIC AND STRAIN IT 
THROUGH HER HEART AND POUR IT OUT 
THROUGH HER SOUL SO IT WAS HER OWN 
HIT THAT UNIVERSAL CHORD THAT 
STRUCK US IN OUR HEARTS WE 
RESPONDED WE HEARD HER SINGING

SAID I LOVE YOU YOU KNOW YOU 
JUST COULDN'T HELP RESPONDING 
THERE WAS IT CAME FROM SO DEEP 
INSIDE 
ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OF INSIDE THE MOST POWERFUL SONGS IN BLACK 
AMERICAN CULTURE STRANGE FRUIT 
THE FIRST TIME YOU HEAR THAT IT 
KNOCKS YOU SIDEWAYS 
IT BECAME PART 
OF HER CONTRACT THAT SHE WOULD HAVE 
TO SING THAT SONG BECAUSE IT MEANT 
SOMETHING TO HER IT'S ALSO WHAT 
PROBABLY TURNED THE NARCOTICS 
BUREAU AND REST OF THEM AGAINST HER 
BECAUSE THE SORT OF RACISM AT THE 
TIME SHE WAS OUT THERE WITH THAT 
SONG 
IT WAS ABOUT LYNCHINGS YEAH SONG YEAH MIRAPOLE WROTE THE SONG HE WAS 
AFFECTED BY THIS PHOTOGRAPH OF 
LYNCHING THAT HE SAW IT WAS JUST 
YOU KNOW ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT

EXISTENCE REALLY INFLUENCED HOW SHE 
SANG AND THE MEANING THAT SHE GAVE 
TO THE WORDS IT MADE HER A 
DIFFERENT SINGER DID IT IF SHE 
HADN'T HAD THAT LIFE WOULD SHE BE 
THE SAME

PICTURE I PLAY LES TREMAIN THE 
RADIO STAR L. GET TO DO WHAT I AM 
GOING TO DO LIVE ON FRIDAY AT 
SEVEN THIRTY P. M. IN THE FILM WE WERE ALL 
DRESS FOR NINETEEN THIRTY NINE THE WHOLE STUDIO 
AROUND THE WHOLE MICROPHONE RADIO 
SEEMS TO BE COMING BACK INTO 
SOMETHING 
WE ARE BIG FANS LOVELY SOMETHING TO SEE YOU IT IS ON FRIDAY SEVEN THIRTY P. M. 
AT CHELTENHAM 
AND RADIO TWO 
WITH THEIR RAINBOW BILLS AND 
DISTINCTIVE PLUMAGE YOU WOULD THINK 
PUFFINS WERE EASY TO COUNT 
SCIENTISTS CARRYING OUT A CENSUS OF 
THE FARNE ISLANDS FIND OUT THAT THE 
BIRDS ARE NOT AS FRIENDLY OR AS 
FUNNY AS THEY LOOK HAVE YOU 
STARTED TO COUNT THEM YET HOW MANY 
HAVE YOU GOT UP TO 
THERE ARE 
THOUSANDS OF PUFFINS OUT ON THE 
ISLAND HERE THE COUNT IS DUE TO 
START IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS ONCE 
THOSE BIRDS START SITTING ON THEIR 
EGGS AND REMAIN MORE STATIC HERE 
WE ARE BEHIND YOU CAN SEE THE 
LOVELY BEACH THE REASON WE ARE 
HERE THIS MORNING ARE THOSE ISLANDS 
A COUPLE OF MILES OFF SHORE THE 
FARNE ISLANDS OVER A VERY CALM SEA 
WHAT THE WARDENS HOPE FOR IS MORE 
GOOD WEATHER LIKE THIS OVER THE 
COMING SUMMER IT WAS BAD LAST YEAR 
THE WEATHER CAUSED MANY OF THE 
BUREAUS AND NESTS TO BE WASHED AWAY 
THEY HOPE FOR MUCH BETTER THINGS 
THIS YEAR 
THEY ARE AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS 
THE CLOWNS OF THE AIR THEIR BRIGHT 
BILLS INQUISITIVE NATURE AND FUNNY 
WALK MAKE PUFFINS FAVOURITE 
EVERY FIVE YEARS HERE ON THE FARNE 
ISLANDS THERE IS A HEAD COUNT NOT 
EASY WHEN THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME 
AND KEEP MOVING 
WE HAVE TO DIVIDE 
FROM PREVIOUS SURVEYS 
THE COUNTERS 
SAY THERE IS A VALUE TO THE SURVEY 
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THE PUFFINS 
ARE AN ENVIRONMENTAL BAROMETER FOR 
THE FARNE ISLANDS AND NORTH SEA 
COUNTING THE POPULATION WE CAN SEE 
EVERY FIVE YEARS WHETHER THEY ARE 
DOING WELL OR BAD IF SO THE 
REASONS BEHIND THAT 
PUFFINS NEST 
IN BUREAUS WHERE EACH PAIR RAISES 
A SINGLE CHICK SO TO GET AN 
ACCURATE POPULATION COUNT THE LONG 
ARM OF THE WARDEN COMES CALLING WE WE BRING A SMALL NUMBER OF BIRDS OUT 
AND CHECK THEIR WEIGHT AND MASS 
PUT THE BIRD BACK DOWN INTO THE 
BUREAU 
THE RESULTS SO FAR THIS BUREAU YEAR ARE ENCOURAGING IF THE PUFFIN 
NUMBERS ARE ON THE INCREASE THAT 
IS GOOD NEWS FOR OTHER BIRDS SUCH 
AS THIS RAZORBILL IT MEANS THERE 
IS PLENTY OF FOOD IN THE SEA TO 
SUPPORT THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
BIRDS WHO LIVE HERE THROUGHOUT THE 
SPRING AND SUMMER BUT IT IS THE 
PUFFINS WHO DRAW THE CROWDS THE THE MOST COMAL BIRD AND MOST LIKABLE 
BIRD 
VERY COMAL THEY DO FUNNY BIRD ANTICS HOP AROUND THEY ARE LOVELY 
LITTLE THINGS 
EXPERTS HOPE TO 
COUNT SIXTY THOUSAND PATIENTS BREEDING ON 
THIS COLONY IN THE COMING WEEKS 
THAT WILL BE TEN THOUSAND MORE BIRDS THAN 
THERE WERE AT THE LAST COUNT FIVE 
YEARS AGO THE WARDLEENS SAY THEY 
ARE THANKFUL THEY ONLY HAVE TO DO 
THIS ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS WHEN 
THEY PUT THEIR ARMS DOWN THE 
BUREAUS THEY GET A LOT OF SCRATCHES 
AND BITES IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT 
MORE ALL OF COUNTRYFILE THIS 
SUNDAY IS DEDICATED TO THE FARNE 
ISLANDS THAT IS ON AT ELEVEN OH CLOCK 
IF YOU MUST PICK UP A PUFFIN WEAR 
GLOVES OR PUT IT DOWN 
QUICKLY LUEWOS AND RAVE HAVE 
LOUISE AND RAV HAVE MISSING LIVE
