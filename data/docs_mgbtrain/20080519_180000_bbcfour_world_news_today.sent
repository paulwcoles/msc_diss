OF PESTICIDES LEAD TO CANCER WE 
HAVE A SPECIAL REPORT FROM INDIA ON 
WHETHER THEY HAVE DONE MORE HARM 
THAN GOOD THE CROWDS FLOCK TO SEE 
CHELSEA IN BLOOM 
HELLO WELCOME SIX THOUSAND MIGRANT 
WORKERS HAVE BEEN FORCED OUT OF 
THEIR HOMES ACROSS SOUTH AFRICA AS 
THE XENOPHOBIC VIOLENCE SPREADS AND 
SHOCKS THE COUNTRY POLICE ARE 
SPENDING REINFORCEMENTS TO 
JOHANNESBURG TO STOP THE VIOLENCE 
WHICH ERUPTED A WEEK AGO TWO HUNDRED 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED THE 
MIGRANT WORKERS ARE MOSTLY FROM 
OTHER AFRICAN STATES PARTICULARLY 
ZIMBABWE THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE A 
BETTER LIVING FOR THEMSELVES BUT 
THE BAD ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN SOUTH 
AFRICA WHERE MANY BELIEVE THE TRUE 
UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURE COULD BE FORTY PER CENT 
MEANS SOME POORER SOUTH AFRICANS 
ARE BLAMING FOREIGNERS FOR THEIR 
HARDSHIP HARDSHIP SOME OF THE PICTURES IN THIS REPORT 
ARE VERY GRAPHIC 
SECURITY FORCES TRYING TO CONTAIN 
ATTACKS BY HOSTILE RESIDENTS 
GROWING BOULDER BY THE DAY IT 
LOOKS MORE LIKE A WAR ZONE THAN THE 
ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE OF AFRICA 
CROWDS VENTING THEIR ANGER AGAINST 
FOREIGNERS FOREIGNERS MORE THAN TWENTY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
KILLED MANY MORE INJURED IN 
VIOLENCE THAT HAS RAGED TO T. R. PAST 
WEEK AND SHOWS LITTLE FOR THE 
PAST WEEK AND SHOWS LITTLE SIGN OF 
WANING ONE OF THE MOST DISTURBING 
IMAGES A MAN SET ALIGHT BY HIS 
ATTACKERS T. PROBLEMS IN 
NEIGHBOURING ZIMBABWE MAY HAVE BEEN 
A CATALYST BUT IT IS NOT THE FULL 
STORY 
I THINK BROADLY IT IS ABOUT STORY POLITICAL ALIENATION NOW WHAT IS 
HAPPENING IS THIS PERFECT STORM 
WHERE YOU HAVE RISING FUEL AND FOOD 
PRICES ELECTRICITY CUTS A 
POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION WITH THE 
LEADER THAT PEOPLE ARE UNEASY ABOUT 
AND THEN RHETORIC AND THE TRUTH OF 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF 
ZIMBABWEANS COMING OVER THE BORDER 
AND THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS NOT DONE MUCH EITHER TO ADDRESS 
THE PROBLEMS IN ZIMBABWE OR MORE 
IMPORTANTLY I THINK FOR THE PEOPLE 
HERE TO ADDRESS THE ZIMBABWEANS WHO 
COME TO SOUTH AFRICA 
BUT IT IS NOT JUST ZIMBABWEANS WHO 
FIND THEMSELVES THE VICTIMS OF THE 
VIOLENCE WHAT APPEARS TO BE 
TARGETED AND CAREFULLY PLANNED 
ATTACKS HOMES AND BUSINESSES RUN 
BY OTHER FOREIGN RESIDENTS ARE 
BEING LOOTED MOBS OF YOUTHS ARMED 
WITH CRUDE WEAPONS RUN AMOK SO THE 
NEATLY MOWED LAWNS OF THE CAPITAL'S 
POLICE STATIONS HAVE BEEN 
TRANSFORMED INTO REFUGEE CAMPS 
ZIMBABWEANS CONGOLESE AND OTHERS 
SHELTERING SIDE BY SIDE HERE TWO THOUSAND 
OF THEM 
SHE HAS PROBLEMS WE WE FOUND THIS FIFTY SIX YEAR OLD WOMAN 
LIMPING AND IN PAIN ATTACKED WITH 
A METAL BARBIE A YOUTH OF YOUTHS 
LAST NIGHT SHE AND HER DAUGHTER 
SAY THIS COUNTRY THAT THEY FLED TO 
FOR SAFETY NOW FEELS LIKE HELL 
I WANT TO GO NOW I AM NOT HAPPY 
YOU CAN SEE MANY PEOPLE NOW THEY 
HAVE PROBLEMS LIKE NOT PEOPLE HAVE 
THE PROBLEM NOW NOW I AM NOT HAPPY 
I JUST GO OUT TO BUY SOMETHING IT 
IS PROBLEM NOW 
DO YOU FEEL YOU 
WERE BETTER OFF IN CONGO THAN YOU 
ARE IN SOUTH AFRICA 
I WANT TO GO 
BACK BACK THE TALK IN THIS CAMP IS OF WHO IS 
TO BLAME 
THIS MAN SAYS HIS SOUTH AFRICAN 
NEIGHBOURS TURNED ON HIM 
WE WERE 
STANDING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW WE 
LAUGH WE SHARE JOKES INSIDE THEY 
HAVE SOMETHING WHICH 
IT IS NOT 
SOUTH AFRICA IT IS KILLERS AND CRIMINALS 
DON'T CONDEMN AN ENTIRE CRIMINALS NATION THIS WOMAN RETORTS 
WE KNOW 
THEM AS SOUTH AFRICANS 
BUT THERE 
IS A REAL SENSE HERE THAT THE 
ATTACKS HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY 
ORCHESTRATED PEOPLE HERE HAVE BEEN 
STUNNED THAT ANTI FOREIGN SENTIMENT 
HAS BEEN WHIPPED UP AND MANIPULATED 
TO SUCH DEVASTATING EFFECT LEAVING 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HOMELESS AND 
FOR SARN SOUTH AFRICANS IT IS 
REMINISCE SENSE OF IT IS R. E. M. 
MISSENT OF THE EIGHTIES IT MAY BE A 
FAMILIAR SCENE BUT IT IS A HUGE 
EMBARRASSMENT TO THE CONTINENT'S 
MOST PROSPEROUS NATION A NATION 
WHOSE CITIZENS SOUGHT REFUGE WITH 
RELATIVES OVER THE BORDER EARLIER 
ON I SPOKE TO A BISHOP WHO HAS 
SHELTERED UP TO ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED OF THOSE 
MIGRANT AFRICANS HE TOLD US OF 
THEIR FEARS OF BEING ATTACKED WELL WELL AT THE PRESENT MOMENT THEIR 
FEELINGS RANGE FROM TERROR TO 
BEING FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT THEY 
ARE O. K. IN THE CHURCH TO BEING 
ANGRY AT THE ATTACKS THAT ARE BEING 
LEVELLED AGAINST THEM BUT 
GENERALLY SPEAKING IT IS I MEAN WE 
ARE WITNESSING A HUGE TRAGEDY 
BEFORE US 
HOW MUCH SECURITY ARE 
THE SECURITY FORCES AND POLICE ABLE 
TO GIVE THESE PEOPLE THE THE DISTRESSED PEOPLE ARE LANDING 
THEMSELVES AT THE POLICE STATION 
ONE OF OUR POLICE STATIONS 
ALLEGEDLY HAS OVER TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE 
JUST SITTING ON THE PAVEMENTS 
OUTSIDE I KNOW THAT THEY PUT SOME 
PEOPLE IN A ROOM ON SATURDAY NIGHT 
OTHER POLICE STATIONS HAVE GOT OVER 
EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE CAN I ALSO SAY THAT 
YESTERDAY WE HAD THREE SKIRMISHS IN 
WHICH THERE WERE THREATS TO THE 
ACTUAL CHURCH ITSELF I WAS VERY 
GRATEFUL FOR THE PRESENCE OF THE 
POLICE THEY DID GOOD WORK THEY 
WERE FOCUSED I ACTUALLY THINK THEY 
SAVED OUR DAY YESTERDAY 
WHAT DO 
YOU THINK IS FUELING THIS ANTI 
FOREIGNER FEELING AMONG SOME SOUTH 
AFRICAN S. 
IT IS A FAIRLY AFRICAN S. ORCHESTRATED MANOEUVRE IT IS FAR 
TOO CAREFUL TO BE TO GIVE YOU AN 
ILLUSTRATION LAST NIGHT THERE WAS 
AN ATTACK ON A SPECIFIC BUILDING IN 
ONE OF OUR SUBURBS HERE IN 
JOHANNESBURG THE ONLY REASON WAS 
THAT THERE WERE FOREIGN NATIONS IN 
THAT BUILDING AND THE ONLY WAY ONE 
WOULD KNOW THAT IS IF THEY HAD SOME 
SORT OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS 
HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR 
TOO LONG POOR PEOPLE IN THIS 
COUNTRY HAVE FELT THEY HAVE DROPPED 
OFF THE MARGINS OF THE AGENDA SO 
THE ANXIOUSTYS AROUND POVERTY THE 
ANXIETIES AROUND POVERTY AND THE 
HOPE FOR THE FUTURE HAVE GROWN 
ENORMOUSLY SO THE COMBINATION OF 
THOSE TWO THINGS HAS BROUGHT ABOUT 
IN A SENSE IN THIS INSTANCE THE 
POOR FIGHTING AGAINST THE POOR HOW HOW WIDESPREAD IS SUCH SENTIMENT THERE 
ARE MANY SOUTH AFRICANS WHO WELCOME 
THESE MIGRANT WORKERS PARTICULARLY 
THE ZIMBABWEANS ARE WE TALKING 
ABOUT A SMALL MINORITY HERE I I SHOULD IMAGINE AT THIS STAGE IT IS 
BUT I HAVE A SENSE IN ACTUAL FACT 
I WAS APPROACHED BY SOMEONE FROM 
ONE OF THE COMMITTEES THAT WAS 
SITTING AND YOUNYOUN HEARING SOME 
OF THE STUFF BEING 
SITTING AND YOUNYOUN HEARING SOME OF THE STUFF BEING 
STUFF BEING 
ORGANISED 
HAS THE GOVERNMENT DONE ORGANISED ENOUGH TO STOP THE ATTACKS FROM 
ESCALATING 
I DON'T THINK THEY ESCALATING ANTICIPATED THE EXTENT OF IT SO 
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE PRE EMPTED THE 
ATTACK HERE NUMBER ONE BUT NUMBER 
TWO I THINK THAT WE ARE FAST 
COMING TO THE PLACE WHERE WE NEED A 
SIGN OF SECURITY ON EVERY STREET 
CORNER VISIBLE IN THE COMMUNITY 
TO BEGIN TO START NORM MALLISING 
HAVING NORMALISED THE MATTER I 
THINK WE ARE IN A PLACE WHERE WE 
MUST RECOGNISE THAT IS LIKE TAKING 
AN ANAL G. E. SICK THE PAIN WILL 
DISAPPEAR FOR A WHILE 
WE DO NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN RICH 
AND POOR IN THIS COUNTRY THIS WILL 
COME BACK WITH A VENGEANCE 
IT IS DUE TO RELAX BORDER CONTROLS 
AHEAD OF THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WORLD CUP IT IS 
HOSTING 
CONSIDERING THE WORLD CUP HOSTING WILL HAVE TO HOST FOREIGNERS THIS 
IS NOT A WONDERFUL OMEN IT WOULD 
BE THE RIGHT THING FOR SOUTH AFRICA 
TO RELAX SOME OF THOSE RESTRICTIONS 
ON THE BORDER PARTICULARLY AT THE 
MOMENT TO SUFFERING ZIMBABWEANS 
VERY VULNERABLE FROM ALL HAR 
RASHMENT AND POVERTY OBVIOUSLY THE 
GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE 
DISCUSSIONS ON MANY MANY LEVELS IF 
WE ARE GOING TO BE READY 
NOW LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE 
OTHER NEWS BURMA HAS AGREED TO 
ACCEPT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE AID FROM 
ABROAD TO HELP THE VICTIMS OF 
CYCLONE NARGIS BUT IT WANTS IT 
CHANNELLED THROUGH ASIAN 
ORGANISATIONS THREE DAYS OF 
NATIONAL MOURNING WILL BEGIN 
TOMORROW FOREIGN REPORTERS HAVE 
BEEN BANNED BUT OUR CORRESPONDENT 
MANAGED TO ENTER THE COUNTRY AND 
HAS SPENT THE LAST FEW DAYS IN THE 
RANGOON AREA 
TWENTY MINUTES OUTSIDE RANGOON A 
CHECKPOINT ON THE ROAD 
FOR A TENSE HOUR WE WAITED WE WERE 
IN BURMA ILLEGALLY 
OUR DRIVER WAS TAKEN AWAY TO BE 
QUESTIONED QUESTIONED ALL ROULTS HAD BEEN SEALED ALL 
ROUTES HAD BEEN SEALED OFF TO STOP 
REPORTERS GETTING INTO THE 
IRRAWADDY DELTA 
THEY TOLD ME 
AID WORKERS TOO ARE 
BEING KEPT IN RANGOON EVEN THOUGH 
AN ESTIMATED TWO AND A HALF MILLION 
PEOPLE ARE NEEDED OUTSIDE BURMA'S 
MILITARY RULERS ARE CONCERNED THEIR 
EFFORTS ARE INADEQUATE WOULD LOSEN 
THEIR HOLD ON POWER 
DESPITE THE SECURITY CLAMP DOWN WE 
MANAGED TO GET OUT TO ONE VILLAGE 
PEOPLE WERE SITTING BY THEIR RUINED 
HOMES WAITING FOR AID MEMBERS OF 
THE BURMESE RED CROSS HAD JUST 
ARRIVED TWO WEEKS AFTER THE 
CYCLONE HIT 
AND UNSENSORED INFORMATION IS 
GETTING TO BURMA'S PEOPLE WE 
BOUGHT THIS D. V. D. ON A STREET CORNER 
SHOT BY ANONYMOUS CITIZENS WITH KAM 
CORDERS THE SCENES OF DEVASTATION 
AND PEOPLE WITH LITTLE AID FUELING 
THE DISCONTENT ALREADY FELT HERE 
THESE SURVIVORS WERE HUDDLED IN A 
MONASTERY MONASTERY 
OUT OF THREE HUNDRED HOUSES ONLY ONE HUNDRED SURVIVED 
I HAD TO CLING ON TO A TREE TO SURVIVE 
BUT ONLY THE BOLD 
SPEAK OUT RISKING ARREST THIS MAN 
URGED FOREIGN WARSHIPS WAITING ON 
THE COAST TO BRING IN SUPPLIES 
REGARDLESS OF THE MILITARY 
GOVERNMENT'S WISHES 
THEY WANT TO 
HELP ME BUT OUR GOVERNMENT WANTS 
THEIR HELP THEY MUST COME BY FORCE 
ORDINARY PEOPLE OF RANGOON ARE 
TRAVELLING TO STRICKEN AREAS TO DO 
WHAT THEY CAN TO HELP THE RULERS 
SEEM MORE CONCERNED ABOUT SAVING 
THEMSELVES THAN THEIR PEOPLE 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS CHINA 
HAVE PAUSED FOR THREE MINUTES TO 
MOURN THE VICTIMS OF THE EARTHQUAKE 
A WEEK AFTER IT STRUCK AIR RAID 
SIRENS SOUNDED MOTORISTS BLUE 
THEIR HORNS AS THE COUNTRY CAME TO 
A STANDSTILL IT IS THE FIRST OF 
THREE NATIONAL DAYS OF MOURNING 
WITH THE OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY 
SUSPENDED THE AUTHORITIES SAY MORE 
THAN THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE KNOWN TO 
HAVE DIED WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS 
MORE MISSING CUSTODY HEARINGS FOR 
FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY THREE CHILDREN FOUND LIVING IN A 
POLYGAMIST SECT ARE STARTING 
SHORTLY IN TEXAS THE CHILDREN WERE 
PLACED IN FOSTER CARE THE 
AUTHORITIES SAID THEY WERE FORCED 
INTO UNDERAGE MARRIAGES BY THEIR 
FAM LIS THE GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN 
APPROVAL TO A SERIES OF PROPOSALS 
AIMED TO IMPROVE RELATIONS BETWEEN 
THE PUBLIC AND THE MILITARY AMONG 
THE REMINUTE R. MENATIONS ARE PLANS 
FOR A NATIONAL ARMED FORCES DAY AND 
MAKING IT AN OFFENCE TO 
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ANYONE WEARING 
A MILITARY UNIFORM NOW THE 
BOUNDARIES OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE 
SCIENTIFICLY ARE PUSHED ALL THE 
TIME BY DISCOVERIES IN BRITAIN THE 
WAY HAS BEEN CLEARED FOR SCIENTISTS 
TO USE HYBRID HUMAN ANIMAL EMBRYOS 
SCIENTISTS SAY THE RESEARCH COULD 
SAVE MILLIONS OF LIVES CRITICS SAY 
CREATING HYBRID EMBRYOS TAMPERS 
WITH NATURE AND IS IMMORAL THE AIM 
IS SIMPLE TO BRING BRITAIN'S EIGHTEEN 
YEAR OLD LAWS INTO LINE WITH 
SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES BUT THE ETHICS 
INVOLVED ARE COMPLEX AND EMOTIVE 
PERHAPS THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL 
ISSUE DEBATED BY M. P.'S IS WHETHER TO 
ALLOW RESEARCH USING HYBRID EMBRYOS 
TO CONTINUE HYBRID EMBRYOS ARE 
PART ANIMAL PART HUMAN THE STEM 
CELLS CAN BE USED TO STUDY 
ALZHEIMER'S OR PARKING SONS I 
ALLOWS PIONEERING RESEARCH NOW 
WHICH COULD HAVE BENEFITS LATER 
DON'T BAN IT TO DO SO WOULD REALLY 
INHIBIT BRITAIN'S ABILITY TO BE THE 
WORLD LEADER IN STEM CELL RESEARCH 
AND WOULD SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE 
THESE WILL BE USED BY SCIENTISTS 
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO DEVELOP NEW 
TERM THERAPIES FOR DISEASE 
THE TROUBLE IS SCIENTISTS CANNOT 
SAY WHEN THE RESEARCH WILL BEAR 
FRUIT AND CRITICS BELIEVE THE BASIC 
CONCEPT OF MIXING ANIMAL AND HUMAN 
IS FUNDAMENTALLY IMMORAL DESPITE DESPITE ALL THIS HYPE ABOUT THE FACT WE ARE 
GOING TO CURE PARKINSON'S DISEASE 
AND MOTOR NEURONE DISEASE AND 
NOBODY DOUBTS THESE ARE TERRIBLE 
DISEASES AFTER TWENTY YEARS NOT A 
SINGLE CURE HAS COME ALL WE HAVE 
IS SCIENTISTS TELLING US IT WILL 
COME YOU HAVE TO PUSH OUT THE 
ETHICAL BOUNDARIES UNTIL THERE ARE 
NO BOUNDARIES WHATSOEVER THE THE SECOND ISSUE IS ALSO PROVING 
CONTENTIOUS SOME SEVERE OR LIFE 
THREATENING CONDITIONS CAN BE 
TREATED BY AN INFUSION OF BLOOD 
CELLS TAKEN FROM A GENETICALLY 
MATCHED BABY SCIENTISTS CAN CREATE 
SUCH A MATCH IN IT AND LABORATORY 
SO CALLED SAVIOUR SIBLINGS IT IS 
WORKING FOR THE WHITAKER FAMILY 
BUT OPPONENTS ARGUE IT IS WRONG TO 
CREATE ONE LIFE SIMPLY TO SAVE 
ANOTHER 
BRITAIN IS NOT ALONE IN FACING SUCH 
DILEMMAS AND DIFFERENT COUNTRIES 
ARE TAKING DIFFERENT APPROACHES 
CHINESE AND AMERICAN SCIENTISTS 
HAVE CARRIED OUT RESEARCH ON HYBRID 
EMBRYOS FOR SOME TIME BUT SOME 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE BANNED THE 
CREATION OF EMBRYOS FOR RESEARCH 
PURPOSES ITALY ONCE HAD ONE OF THE 
MOST UNREGULATED APPROACHES TO 
EVERY A RESEARCH BUT HAS SINCE 
TIGHTENED ITS RULES CONSIDERABLY 
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THE AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT 
VOTED TO ALLOW EMBRYONIC STILL SOME 
RESEARCH BUT BAND D. CREATION OF ALL 
KINDS OF HYBRID EMBRYOS THE 
CHALLENGE IS TO KEEP THE 
LEGISLATION UP TO DATE 
WE MUST 
ALLOW BOTH THE THIS SORT OF 
RESEARCH AND ADULTS STEM CELL 
RESEARCH TO CONTINUE AND ALLOW 
SCIENTISTS AND THEIR FUNDERS TO 
CHOOSE WHICH ONE TO GO FOR AND 
INSURE THE REGULATOR IN THIS 
COUNTRY WHICH REGULATES THE 
RESEARCH REQUIRES SCIENTIFIC AND 
ETHICAL JUSTIFICATION 
M. P.'S HAVE 
BEEN TOLD THEY DO NOT HAVE TO 
FOLLOW PARTY LINES BUT ARE FREE TO 
VOTE ACCORDING TO THEIR CONSCIENCES 
AT THIS STAGE THEY FACE FURTHER 
DIFFICULT QUESTIONS ON TUESDAY 
WHETHER THE NEED FOR A FATHER 
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BEFORE SINGLE 
AND A SINGLE WOMEN AND LESBIAN 
COUPLES ARE APPROVED FOR I. V. F. AND 
WHETHER THE LEGAL LIMIT FOR 
ABORTIONS SHOULD BE REDUCED BECAUSE 
OF ADVANCES IN THE TREATMENT OF 
PREMATURE BABIES SCIENCE AND 
RELIGION PERSONAL BELIEF AND 
PUBLIC POLICY IT'S A TRICKY 
BALANCE TO FIND IN THE PAST HALF 
OUR M. P.'S HAVE VOTED ON THIS RACHEL 
HARVEY JOINS US WITH THE LATEST ON 
THOSE BOATS M. P.'S VOTING ON QUITE A 
FEW THINGS NOW VOTES 
THE MAIN 
HEADLINE GRABBER IF YOU LIKE WAS 
THE PROPOSAL TO BAN ALL RESEARCH ON 
HYBRID EMBRYOS THAT HAS BEEN 
COMPREHENSIVELY DEFEATED ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX IN 
SAY IT IN FAVOUR OF THE VAN AND 
THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX AGAINST BANNER SO BANNER 
THE SECOND AMENDMENT OF THE BILL 
HAS ALSO BEEN REJECTED 
I THINK THIS INDICATES THE TREND 
IT LOOKS AS IF THINGS ARE GOING IN 
FAVOUR OF CONTINUING THE RESEARCH 
AS YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR REPORT 
BRITAIN IS AHEAD OF THE PACK IN 
THIS AND TAKES THE LEAD IN STEM 
CELL RESEARCH 
IT HAS DONE IT HAS 
A REPUTATION FOR BEING THE VANGUARD 
OF THIS NEW RESEARCH DIFFERENT 
COUNTRIES TREE THESE ISSUES 
DIFFERENTLY THEY ALL HAVE THEIR 
OWN LINE IN THE SAND SO CATHOLIC 
COUNTRIES TEND TO BE CONSERVATIVE 
ON ABSTRACT RESEARCH BUT WOULD BE 
MORE IN FAVOUR OF ANYTHING THAT 
HELPS I. V. F. TREATMENT THERE IS AN 
ELEMENT OF COMPETITION ENORMOUS IF 
A COUNTRY BOUNCES KIND OF RESEARCH 
THEN THE EXPERTS INVOLVED IN IT 
WILL GO ELSEWHERE BANS THIS SO 
WHILE WE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH 
TECHNICAL AND ERUDITE ISSUES THE 
BOTTOM LINE IS JUST BECAUSE 
SCIENTISTS CAN DO SOMETHING SHOULD 
POLITICIANS AND ETHICS PROFESSOR 
HAS ALLOW THEM TO DO SO THAT IS 
THE CENTRAL QUESTION AND WILL BE 
FOR MANY YEARS 
ANOTHER VOTE ON 
SAVIOUR SIBLINGS TONIGHT AND A 
COUPLE MORE TOMORROW SPRAYING 
CROPS WITH PRESSED PESTICIDES 
PLAYS A ROLE IN THE MASS PRODUCTION 
OF AFFORDABLE FOOD BUT THEY COULD 
BE A DARKER SIDE TO THIS TECHNOLOGY 
RESEARCH CARRIED OUT AT PUNJAB 
UNIVERSITY HAS REVEALED THE USE OF 
PESTICIDES COULD HAVE CAUSED 
GENETIC DAMAGE AMONG RURAL 
COMMUNITIES IN INDIA SIGN TO SAY 
IT COULD BE THE REASON FOR 
INCREASED CANCER RATES FROM WORKERS 
MIXING UP A COCKTAIL OF CHEMICALS 
TO KILL PESTS HAS BECOME A ROUTINE 
PART OF FARMING WORLDWIDE BUT HERE 
IN PUNJAB THERE ARE INCREASING 
CONCERNS THAT THE PRACTICE COULD BE 
KILLING MORE THAN THE PESTS THAT 
ATTACK THEIR WE'D ALTHOUGH THE 
BOTTLE ALTHOUGH THERE ARE 
WARNINGS THAT THIS IS POISONOUS AND 
USERS SHOULD WEAR PROTECTIVE 
CLOTHING THEY JUST HAVE THIN 
CLOTHING FARMERS ALL HAVE STORIES 
OF HOW THEY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED 
THEY BELIEVE BY USING THE SPRAY 
IN THIS GROUP A YOUNG MAN RECENTLY 
COLLAPSED AND WAS PASSING BLOOD 
AFTER USING A SPRAY 
I AM AFRAID A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE 
DIED BECAUSE OF THE SPRAY 
THE FEAR 
OF WHAT THEY MAY BE DOING TO 
THEMSELVES IS A HARD THING TO ADMIT 
THE INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE PRACTICES 
THE GREEN REVOLUTION OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
HAS MADE THIS THE RICHEST FARMLAND 
IN INDIA THE WORST PART OF IT IS 
THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS SAVED THE 
LIVES OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND 
THE WORLD BY PROVIDING BETTER 
CHEAPER FOOD OVER THE LAST THREE 
DECADES IT HAS MADE PUNJAB BRIDGE 
BUT AT A TERRIBLE PRICE THERE HAS 
BEEN SUSPICION FOR YEARS ABOUT 
POTENTIAL LINKS BETWEEN PROCESSED 
PESTICIDE USE AND CANCER NEW 
RESEARCH AMONG THESE FARMWORKERS 
SUGGESTS WHY THEY MAY BE AFFECTED 
WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN 
THE D. N. A. SO WE CAN SAY THE 
LIKELIHOOD OF CANCER IS INCREASED 
THESE IMAGES SHOW NORMAL D. N. A. 
UNDAMAGED THEN AT THE BUILDING 
BLOCKS OF LIFE ITSELF D. N. A. DAMAGED 
WITH A LONG TAIL THEY CALL A IT 
WE ALSO CONSIDERED OTHER 
CONFOUNDING FACTORS AGE SMOKING 
ALCOHOL INTAKE AND DIETARY HABITS 
ALL OF THEM DID NOT SHOW ANY 
RELATION SO FROM THERE WE CAN SAY 
THE DAMAGE WAS BECAUSE OF THESE 
PESTICIDES ONLY MOST PROBABLY SO 
THE CANCER RISK IS GREATLY 
INCREASED 
WE FOUND THE INCIDENT OF D. N. A. DAMAGE 
HIGHER AMONGST THESE WORKERS THE THE REPORT DOES NOT TARGET ONE 
PARTICULAR FIRM THE PESTICIDE 
INDUSTRY DENIES THE CLAIMS THERE THERE IS NO PESTICIDE IN USE TODAY WHICH 
CAN CAUSE CANCER LET ME ALSO SAY 
NOBODY IS USING PESTICIDES ALL THE 
TIME THEY ARE USED FOR EIGHT 
SEASON ONE OR TWO SPRAYS AT A TIME 
THIS MAN AND HIS WIFE ARE OF A 
GENERATION WHO HAS BENEFITED MOST 
FROM THE GREEN REVOLUTION BOTH ARE 
NOW SUFFERING FROM CANCER TO KEEP 
THE PESTS DOWN THEY DO NEED TO 
SPRAY NIGHT AND DAY WE HAVE BEEN USING 
SPRAY FOR TWENTY YEARS AND IN THE 
BEGINNING WE USED SMALLER AMOUNTS 
BUT NOW WE USE MORE WE HAVE TO USE 
THEM ROUND THE CLOCK IN THE GROWING 
GROWING SEASON 
A REPORT IN THE LOCAL PAPER ASKS IF 
BABIES WITH A EXPLAINED BIRTH 
DEFECTS COULD BE CONNECTED WITH THE 
WAY THE SPRAY IS USED 
THE PROBLEM IS THE 
BEST SIDES IS NOT AFFECTING THE BE 
PESTS THERE ARE EVEN MORE PEST 
THE PROBLEM IS GETTING WORSE 
IN A SOCIETY WHERE PEOPLE LIVE 
CLOSE TO THE SOIL AND TO THEIR 
ANIMALS THE POSSIBILITY THE WAY 
THEY HAD BEEN USING PESTICIDES AS 
BEEN DAMAGING THEIR HEALTH IS A 
FRIGHTENING ONE IT IS THE WHOLE OF 
THE FOOD CHAIN WHICH COULD BE 
AFFECTED IT MIGHT MEAN A RADICAL 
CHANGE TO FARMING PRACTICES WILL BE 
NEEDED AT JUST AT THE TIME THE 
WORLD NEEDS RELIABLE CHEAP SAFE 
SOURCES OF FOOD HERE IT IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE 
ANNUAL CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW IT IS 
NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH GARDENING 
EXTRAVAGANCE BUT THIS YEAR IT ALSO 
TACKLES MORE PRESSING NEEDS SUCH AS 
PARKING YOUR BIG RUBBISH WE BEEN 
AND FINDING SOMEWHERE FOR THE 
CHILDREN TO PLAY HAVE WE BEEN 
WHEELIE BINS 
THE BLOOMS ARE PERFECT THE DESIGNS 
SPECTACULAR THIS IS WHERE THE RICH 
AND FAMOUS COME FOR GARDEN IDEAS 
IT IS INSPIRATIONAL TO COME HERE 
AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO IN A SMALL 
PLACE 
IT DOES REFLECT WIDER TRAINS PLACE SUCH AS THE NEW FASHIONABLE ELEMENT 
OF GROWING VEGETABLES 
MY SPINACH 
IS MAGNIFICENT GARLIC ONIONS POTATOES I NEVER DO WELL WITH 
CARROTS 
AND HAVING YOUR OWN CARROTS CHICKENS THIS IS CHELSEA S. TAKE 
ON THE CHICKEN COOKED AND THIS IS 
WHERE YOU GET THE EGGS FROM THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED 
FOR A CHICKEN COOKED AFTER THE 
FASHION FOR GREEN ROOM SO WE NOW 
HAVE GREEN WALLS THERE ARE ALSO 
OTHER DOUBLE ISSUES SUCH AS 
ALLOWING CHILDREN MORE OPPORTUNITY 
TO PLAY OUTSIDE HOWEVER MIXING 
KIDS AND CHELSEA BLAND PERFECTION 
IS NOT EASY ARE YOU NERVOUS 
A BIT 
BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT 
IT IS AN INCREDIBLY STIMULATING 
SPACE FOR THEM 
SO WHEN MIDST THE A 
BOTANICAL GLAMOUR AND UNOBTAINABLE 
GARDEN PERFECTION SOME SOLUTIONS TO 
REAL GARDEN PROBLEMS EVEN A 
PERENNIAL PLACE TO PUT THE WHEELIE 
BIN 
A REMINDER NOW OF THE TOP STORIES 
THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS LIVING IN 
SOUTH AFRICA HAVE TAKEN REFUGE IN 
POLICE STATIONS AND CHURCHES AFTER 
THEY CAME UNDER ATTACK POLICE SAY 
AT LEAST TWENTY TWO PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN KILLED SINCE THE VIOLENCE 
ERUPTED A WEEK AGO SPARKED BY THE 
BELIEF THAT FOREIGN WORKERS ARE 
TAKING SCARCE SOUTH AFRICAN JOBS 
MANY OF THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT 
REFUGE ARE ZIMBABWEANS WHO HAVE 
FLED VIOLENCE AND POVERTY AT HOME 
THE BOAT HAS BEEN TAKEN IN THE PAST 
HALF HOUR ABOUT EMBRYOS NEXT THE WEATHER GOODBYE 
IT WILL BE QUITE A FROSTY CHILLY 
START FOR TUESDAY AFTER THAT THE 
SKIES BRIGHTON AND CLOUD BUBBLES UP 
THEY COULD BE SOME SHOWERS IN THE 
AFTERNOON FOR THE MOST PART IT IS 
TRY AND A NICE DAY TRY DOWN TO THE MIDLANDS IT IS GOOD 
LONDON LOOKING FINE AND THE SOUTH 
COAST THERE WILL BE PATCHY CLOUD 
AND NUMBERS ABOUT FIFTEEN FOR PLYMOUTH 
SIMILAR IN CARDIFF A LOVELY DRY 
SUNNY AFTERNOON FOR WALES MUCH THE 
SAME IN NORTHERN IRELAND THANKS TO 
THE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE IN PLACE 
THIS SYSTEM WILL SPIRAL AROUND AND 
NURTURE AT THE HIGH PRESSURE 
THROUGH TUESDAY TO WHENCE IT IT 
WINS OUT EVENTUALLY AND EASES IN 
WEDNESDAY IS STILL DRY YOU COULD 
GET WET WEATHER IN NORTHERN IRELAND
