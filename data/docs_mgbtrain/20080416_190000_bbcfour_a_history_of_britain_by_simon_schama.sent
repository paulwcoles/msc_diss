IT WAS THE HAND OF GOD THAT DECIDED THE OUTCOME OF BATTLES 
THE FATE OF NATIONS AND THE LIFE OR DEATH OF KINGS EVERYONE KNEW THAT 
IT WAS WINTER THE SEASON OF FROST AND DEATH AND A KING LAY DYING 
HIS NAME WAS EDWARD THE CONFESSOR 
HE WAS DYING CHILDLESS AND IT WAS FAR FROM OBVIOUS WHO WOULD SUCCEED HIM 
AS THERE WAS NO HEIR MANY THOUGHT THAT THEY SHOULD BE THE NEXT KING 
INCLUDING SOME FOREIGN PRINCES LIKE DUKE WILLIAM OF NORMANDY 
BUT AMONG THOSE GATHERED ROUND THE BED OF THE DYING SAXON KING WAS THE NEXT MOST POWERFUL MAN IN ENGLAND 
HAROLD GODWINSON AND HE THOUGHT THE CROWN WOULD LOOK WELL ON HIS HEAD 
HE WAS HOPING FOR SOME SIGN THAT KING EDWARD FELT THE SAME WAY 
AND THEN EDWARD STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND TOUCHED HAROLD BUT WAS HE GIVING HIM A BLESSING OR A CURSE 
WAS THIS THE HAND OF GOD MAKING HAROLD KING NOBODY KNEW FOR SURE 
BUT HAROLD HAD NO QUALMS HAROLD SEIZED THE CROWN 
THE QUESTION NOW WAS FOR HOW LONG WOULD HE KEEP IT 
AND THEN IN THE APRIL SKY THE HAND OF GOD SHOWED ITSELF AS A COMET THE HAIRY STAR 
EVERYONE KNEW THIS WAS NO BLESSING BUT AN EVIL OMEN 
THE YEAR WAS ONE THOUSAND SIXTY SIX 
HISTORIANS LIKE A QUIET LIFE AND USUALLY THEY GET IT 
FOR THE MOST PART HISTORY MOVES AT A GLACIAL PACE WORKING ITS CHANGES SUBTLY 
IN BRITAIN WE LIKE TO THINK THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT OUR HISTORY LIKE OUR CLIMATE AND OUR LANDSCAPE 
THAT'S MODERATE NOT GIVEN TO EARTHQUAKES AND REVOLUTIONS 
BUT THERE ARE TIMES AND PLACES WHEN HISTORY BRITISH HISTORY 
COMES AT YOU WITH A RUSH VIOLENT DECISIVE BLOODY 
A TRUCKLOAD OF TROUBLE KNOCKING YOU DOWN 
WIPING OUT EVERYTHING THAT GIVES YOU YOUR BEARINGS IN THE WORLD LAW CUSTOM LOYALTY AND LANGUAGE 
AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES 
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE SITE OF A NATIONAL TRAUMA 
ESPECIALLY THESE DAYS WHEN IT LOOKS MORE SUITABLE FOR A COUNTY FAIR THAN A MASS SLAUGHTER 
BUT THIS IS THE BATTLEFIELD OF HASTINGS 
AND HERE ONE KIND OF ENGLAND WAS ANNIHILATED AND ANOTHER KIND OF ENGLAND WAS SET UP IN ITS PLACE 
SOME HISTORIANS WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MOST OF THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND 
HASTINGS DIDN'T MATTER THAT MUCH WITH NORMAN KNIGHTS REPLACING SAXON LORDS 
THE PEASANTS STILL PLOUGHED THEIR FIELDS PAID TAXES TO THE KING 
PRAYED TO AVOID POVERTY AND DISEASE AND WATCHED THE SEASONS ROLL ROUND 
BUT THE EVERYDAY CAN RUB SHOULDERS WITH THE GENUINELY CATASTROPHIC 
YES THE GRASS GREW GREEN HERE AGAIN BUT NOW THERE WERE BONES BENEATH THE BUTTERCUPS 
THE GOVERNING CLASS OF THE ENGLISH HAD BEEN DISPOSSESSED THEIR MEN LAND AND ANIMALS TAKEN FROM THEM 
AND GIVEN AS SPOILS TO THE VICTORIOUS FOREIGNERS 
YOU COULD SURVIVE AND STILL BE ENGLISH BUT NOW YOU BELONGED TO AN INFERIOR RACE THE CONQUERED 
YOU LIVED IN ENGLAND BUT IT WAS NO LONGER YOUR COUNTRY 
ANGLO SAXON ENGLAND WAS NO STRANGER TO INVASIONS VIKING RAIDS HAD BEEN PART OF LIFE FOR A CENTURY 
BUT SINCE THE DAYS OF ALFRED THE GREAT THE COUNTRY WAS STABLE ENOUGH TO SOAK THEM UP 
THE LONGBOATS CAME AND WENT BUT STILL THE KING'S LAW RAN THE SHIRES 
HIS CHURCHES AND ABBEYS WERE BUILT MORE BEAUTIFULLY THAN EVER 
A TOWN THAT WOULD ONE DAY BE CALLED LONDON WAS BEGINNING TO GROW AND PROSPER ON THE BANKS OF THE THAMES 
AND THEN ONE INVASION SUCCEEDED WHERE THE OTHERS HAD FAILED AND THERE WAS A VIKING ON THE THRONE 
HIS NAME WAS CANUTE WHO WE REMEMBER FOR TRYING TO HOLD BACK THE TIDES 
AND WHILE HE TURNED ANGLO SAXON ENGLAND INTO PART OF HIS VAST MARITIME EMPIRE HE CHANGED NOTHING 
HE EVEN CHOSE AS HIS CLOSEST ADVISOR 
ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL ANGLO SAXON NOBLES GODWIN EARL OF WESSEX 
A SCHEMING RUTHLESS MAN GODWIN BECAME VIRTUAL CO RULER WITH CANUTE 
OVER WHAT WAS STILL RECOGNISABLY ANGLO SAXON ENGLAND 
BUT CANUTE'S DEATH IN ONE THOUSAND THIRTY FIVE BEGAN A CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT WOULD CULMINATE 
IN THE ONE INVASION THAT ANGLO SAXON ENGLAND WOULD BE UNABLE TO SWALLOW AND WHAT A SAGA IT WAS 
IT STARTED WITH A BLOODY AND UNSPARING FIGHT FOR CANUTE'S THRONE AMONGST THE SURVIVING ELITE 
TREACHERY MURDER AND MUTILATION WERE PAR FOR THE COURSE 
THE LAST MAN STANDING WITH ANY KIND OF CLAIM TO THE THRONE WAS A DESCENDANT OF ALFRED THE GREAT 
A PRINCE OF THE SAXON ROYAL HOUSE 
HE WAS CALLED EDWARD AND WOULD BE FOREVER KNOWN AS THE CONFESSOR HE WAS CROWNED ON EASTER DAY ONE THOUSAND FORTY THREE 
BUT HE INHERITED MORE THAN JUST THE CROWN 
HE ALSO GOT EARL GODWIN IN NO MOOD TO LOSE POWER JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS A NEW KING 
UNLIKE CANUTE EDWARD HAD REASON TO HATE THE RIGHT HAND MAN FORCED ON HIM 
FOR GODWIN HAD ARRANGED HIS OLDER BROTHER'S MURDER 
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO ABOUT HIS BLOODSTAINED RIVAL YET 
KING EDWARD KNEW THAT GODWIN HELD THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM 
AND WHEN GODWIN OFFERED EDWARD HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE WHAT COULD HE DO BUT TAKE HER 
GODWIN WAS NOT EDWARD'S ONLY PROBLEM 
HE ALSO HAD TO LEARN HOW TO GOVERN A COUNTRY HE KNEW LITTLE ABOUT 
FOR HE'D GROWN UP IN EXILE IN A VERY DIFFERENT WORLD ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL IN NORMANDY 
WE THINK OF EDWARD THE CONFESSOR AS THE QUINTESSENTIAL ANGLO SAXON KING 
IN FACT HE WAS ALMOST AS NORMAN AS WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR 
HIS MOTHER EMMA WAS A NORMAN AND HE'D LIVED HERE IN NORMANDY FOR THIRTY YEARS 
EVER SINCE SHE'D BROUGHT HIM AS A CHILD REFUGEE FROM THE WARS BETWEEN THE SAXONS AND THE DANES 
BUT NORMANDY WAS NOT JUST AN ASYLUM FOR EDWARD 
IT WAS THE PLACE WHICH FORMED HIM POLITICALLY AND CULTURALLY 
HIS MOTHER TONGUE WAS NORMAN FRENCH AND HIS VIRTUAL GODFATHERS WERE THE FORMIDABLE DUKES OF NORMANDY 
THE NORMANS WERE DESCENDANTS OF VIKING RAIDERS 
BUT HAD LONG SINCE TRADED IN THEIR LONGBOATS FOR POWERFUL WARHORSES 
THE DUCHY OF NORMANDY WAS IN NO SENSE JUST A PIECE OF FRANCE 
THOUGH THE DUKES DID FORMAL HOMAGE TO THE FRENCH KING IN EVERY OTHER WAY THEY WERE INDEPENDENT 
POSSESSED OF CASTLES PATRONS OF CHURCHES 
THESE WARLORDS WERE CONSTANTLY IN THE SADDLE RULING VASSALS 
FIGHTING OFF REVOLTS AND FORGING SHAKY COALITIONS BUT THE DUCHY WAS ALSO HUMMING WITH ENERGETIC PIETY 
IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY HANDSOME STONE MONASTERIES AND CHURCHES WITH ROMANESQUE ARCHES BEGAN TO APPEAR 
THE FIRST GRANDIOSE STONE CASTLES AS TOUGH AS THE LORDS WHO HAD BUILT THEM BECAME PART OF THE LANDSCAPE 
SO UNTIL THE THRONE OF ENGLAND TEMPTED HIM BACK ACROSS THE CHANNEL AT THE AGE OF THIRTY SIX 
THIS WAS EDWARD'S HOME 
AND WHILE HE WAS HERE A CHILD WAS GROWING UP WHO WOULD CHANGE THE COURSE OF BRITISH HISTORY 
IT WAS ON THE SITE OF THIS CASTLE AT FALAISE IN ONE THOUSAND TWENTY SEVEN THAT WILLIAM 
KNOWN TO ALL HIS CONTEMPORARIES ALTHOUGH NOT IN FRONT OF HIS FACE AS WILLIAM THE BASTARD WAS BORN 
HE WAS INDEED THE ILLEGITIMATE SON OF DUKE ROBERT OF NORMANDY AND THE DAUGHTER OF A TANNER CALLED ERLEVE 
IN THE CUT THROAT WORLD OF FEUDAL NORMANDY IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT HE LEARN QUICKLY HOW TO SURVIVE 
HE WAS ONLY A CHILD WHEN HIS FATHER DIED ON A PILGRIMAGE TO THE HOLY LAND 
LEAVING EIGHT YEAR OLD WILLIAM AS HIS HEIR A LAMB THROWN TO THE WOLVES 
CERTAINLY EDWARD WOULD HAVE KNOWN THE YOUNG WILLIAM 
IT'S EVEN SUGGESTED THAT HE WAS ONE OF THE HAND PICKED COMPANIONS ENTRUSTED BY WILLIAM'S FATHER 
WITH KEEPING AN EYE ON THE VULNERABLE YOUNG BOY 
EDWARD WOULD HAVE SEEN HOW WILLIAM SURVIVED CHILDHOOD TRAUMAS NARROWLY ESCAPING ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS 
HOW WILLIAM WAS FORCED AGED JUST TEN 
TO WITNESS THE BRUTAL MURDER OF HIS BELOVED STEWARD IN HIS BEDCHAMBER BEFORE HIS VERY EYES 
AND EDWARD MUST HAVE MARVELLED AT THE WAY THE STRIPLING BOY GREW INTO A STEELY AND RUTHLESS YOUNG MAN 
EVENTUALLY TRIUMPHING IN BATTLE OVER A FORMIDABLE LEAGUE OF REBEL NOBLES 
WHILE WILLIAM WAS SECURING ABSOLUTE POWER IN NORMANDY 
EDWARD WAS BY NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF A NERVOUS REIGN AND WATCHING OUT FOR HIS BIGGEST THREAT EARL GODWIN 
BUT IN ONE THOUSAND FIFTY ONE EDWARD SEIZED HIS CHANCE TO RID HIMSELF OF HIS RIVAL 
EDWARD HAD BROUGHT OVER NORMAN ALLIES 
ESTABLISHED THEM IN CASTLES MADE ONE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY 
FEELING HIS MOMENT HAD NOW COME 
HE CONFRONTED GODWIN WITH THE CRIME OF HIS BROTHER'S MURDER AND THREW HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY 
BUT EDWARD'S BID TO RID HIMSELF OF HIS SWORN ENEMY FAILED MISERABLY 
IN EXILE THE EARL OF WESSEX WAS AS DANGEROUS AS AT HOME AND SAILED BACK WITH A FLEET TO HUMILIATE THE KING 
OUT WENT EDWARD'S NORMAN CRONIES BACK CAME THE GODWINS 
STRONGER THAN EVER 
EDWARD WAS NOW LITTLE MORE THAN A PUPPET KING 
HE TURNED TO THE RELIGIOUS LIFE SPENDING DAYS IN MEDITATION AND PRAYER BECOMING THE CONFESSOR 
DEVOTING HIMSELF TO THE FOUNDATION OF HIS BENEDICTINE ABBEY UPSTREAM OF LONDON HIS WEST MINSTER 
IMPOTENCE THOUGH HAS ITS USES 
GODWIN CLEARLY HAD AMBITIONS FOR THE FUTURE 
HE'D FOISTED HIS DAUGHTER EDITH ON EDWARD TO GET A YOUNG GODWIN AS THE NEXT KING OF ENGLAND 
BUT EDWARD HAD HIS OWN IDEAS YES HE'D MARRIED EDITH BUT HE WOULD NEVER SLEEP WITH HER 
HIS REVENGE WOULD BE HER CHILDLESSNESS 
NOW EDWARD HAD AN EVEN MORE MISCHIEVOUS THOUGHT 
IF GODWIN WANTS AN HEIR TO THE ENGLISH THRONE SO BADLY I'LL GIVE HIM ONE BUT ONE MORE TO MY LIKING 
AND IT'S AT THIS POINT SO NORMAN CHRONICLERS CLAIMED 
THAT EDWARD PROMISED THE SUCCESSION TO THE DUKE OF NORMANDY WILLIAM THE BASTARD 
OF COURSE NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS IN ENGLAND 
LEAST OF ALL GODWIN WHO IN ONE THOUSAND FIFTY THREE DIED SUDDENLY OF A STROKE WHILE AT DINNER WITH THE KING 
BUT THERE WERE PLENTY OF OTHER GODWINS READY TO TAKE THE GODFATHER'S PLACE 
HIS SONS NOW TOOK OVER WHERE HE HAD LEFT OFF CONTROLLING ENGLAND VIRTUALLY UNCHALLENGED 
PRESIDING OVER THE FAMILY EMPIRE WAS THE ELDEST SON HAROLD 
HAROLD GODWINSON SEEMED TO HAVE EVERYTHING LAND POWER RICHES CHARISMA AN ARISTOCRATIC WIFE 
AND A SUPPORTING TROOP OF LOYAL AND CLEVER BROTHERS 
HE EVEN MANAGED TO MAKE HIMSELF PATRON OF CHURCHES LIKE THIS ONE AT BOSHAM IN SUSSEX 
THOUGH HE DIDN'T DARE MAKE TOO BRAZEN A MOVE 
ANY DISPASSIONATE OBSERVER WOULD HAVE HAD TO CONCLUDE THAT ONCE EDWARD WAS GONE 
THE THRONE WAS HAROLD'S FOR THE TAKING 
AND THEN ALL AT ONCE AN ILL WIND BLEW AWAY THIS FAIR WEATHER VISION 
IT ALL STARTED WITH A VOYAGE THAT NO ONE CAN FULLY EXPLAIN EVEN TO THIS DAY 
IN ONE THOUSAND SIXTY FOUR HAROLD AND A GROUP OF MEN SET SAIL ACROSS THE CHANNEL FOR NORMANDY 
MAYBE IT WAS TO RESCUE HIS YOUNGER BROTHER WOLFSTAN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN HOSTAGE BY WILLIAM 
BUT TO NORMAN CHRONICLERS THE JOURNEY ONLY HAD ONE PURPOSE 
HAROLD WAS CONFIRMING EDWARD'S OFFER OF THE CROWN 
WHY WOULD HAROLD DO SOMETHING SO AGAINST HIS OWN BEST INTERESTS 
PERHAPS THAT'S WHY IT MAKES UP THE FIRST BIT OF THE STORY 
OF THE MOST GRANDIOSE PIECE OF NORMAN PROPAGANDA THE SEVENTY METRE LONG BAYEUX TAPESTRY 
THE TAPESTRY WAS COMMISSIONED BY WILLIAM'S HALF BROTHER BISHOP ODO OF BAYEUX AFTER THE CONQUEST 
BUT IT MAY HAVE BEEN MADE BY ENGLISHWOMEN EMBROIDERERS 
WHO WERE GENERALLY REGARDED AS THE MOST SKILLED STITCHERS IN EUROPE 
WHO ELSE WOULD HAVE MADE SUCH A GLAMOROUS HERO 
SOMETHING SEEMS TO HAVE GONE WRONG IN THE CHANNEL PERHAPS A STORM 
LANDING IN THE TERRITORY OF GUY OF PONTHIEU 
THEY WERE ARRESTED AND HANDED OVER TO GUY'S LIEGE LORD 
WILLIAM OF NORMANDY THE EMBROIDERERS MAKE IT DRAMATICALLY CLEAR 
THAT HAROLD AND HIS MEN NOW FIND THEMSELVES IN AN ALIEN WORLD 
THE SAXONS ARE MOUSTACHIOED AT THIS STAGE IN THE STORY 
WITH A CERTAIN AIR ABOUT THEM DESPITE THEIR PREDICAMENT 
THE NORMANS BY CONTRAST SHAVE THE BACKS OF THEIR HEADS 
THEY ARE THE SCARY HALF SKINHEADS OF THE EARLY FEUDAL WORLD 
REALISING HIS LUCKY NUMBER HAS COME UP WILLIAM CAN BE ALL CHARM AND GENEROSITY TO HIS PRISONER 
CLEVERLY BRINGING HIM INTO HIS MILITARY ENTOURAGE 
WILLIAM TOOK HAROLD ON CAMPAIGN WITH HIM IN BRITTANY 
WHERE HAROLD RETURNS THE FAVOUR BY RESCUING TWO OF WILLIAM'S SOLDIERS 
FROM THE QUICKSANDS OF MONT SAINT MICHEL ONE ON HIS LEFT ARM ONE ON HIS BACK 
BUT WILLIAM'S HOSPITALITY IS STEEL TIPPED 
HE MAKES HAROLD ONE OF HIS KNIGHTS A SOLEMN CEREMONIOUS BUSINESS BUT ONE INVOLVING A TWO WAY OBLIGATION 
WILLIAM NOW HIS LIEGE LORD WOULD BE OBLIGED TO PROTECT HAROLD HIS NEW KNIGHT 
BUT HAROLD WOULD HAVE HAD TO MAKE HIS OWN PROMISES 
AND THERE SEEMS NO DOUBT THAT HE DID SWEAR SOME SORT OF OATH TO THE DUKE 
TO THE MEDIEVAL MIND THERE WAS NOTHING MORE SERIOUS THAN AN OATH 
THE TAPESTRY MAKER MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THIS WAS A RELIGIOUS ACT 
BY HAVING A WITNESS POINT TO THE WORD SACRAMENTUM 
HAROLD'S OATH WAS A KIND OF SACRAMENT SINCE IT WENT TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ENGLAND AFTER EDWARD DIED 
THE ENGLISH SAID THAT HAROLD AGREED TO BE WILLIAM'S MAN ONLY IN NORMANDY 
AND THAT THIS HAD NO BEARING ON THE ENGLISH SUCCESSION 
THE NORMAN CHRONICLERS THOUGH SAID HAROLD HAD SWORN TO HELP WILLIAM TAKE THE THRONE OF ENGLAND 
THE OATH BECAME EVEN MORE BINDING WHEN IN A CHEAP THEATRICAL TRICK 
THE CLOTH WAS WHIPPED FROM THE TABLE OVER WHICH HAROLD HAD SWORN 
UNDERNEATH WAS REVEALED A RELIQUARY CONTAINING THE BONES OF A SAINT 
WELL HOW MUCH TROUBLE WAS HE IN HAD HAROLD PROMISED SOMETHING HE COULDN'T DELIVER 
OR HAD HE MADE NO PROMISES AT ALL ABOUT THE ENGLISH CROWN 
NORMAN CHRONICLERS LIKE TO IMAGINE HAROLD RETURNING HAUNTED BY GUILT SAYING ONE THING AND DOING ANOTHER 
BUT IN ENGLAND AT ANY RATE THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF A QUEASY CONSCIENCE AT ALL 
IN FACT TO GET HIS HANDS ON THE CROWN HAROLD DID SOMETHING INCONCEIVABLE FOR A GODWIN 
SOMETHING WHICH ONE DAY WOULD HAVE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES 
HE SOLD HIS OWN BROTHER TOSTIG DOWN THE RIVER 
TOSTIG WAS THE EARL OF NORTHUMBRIA 
HE WAS ALSO THE FAMILY HOTHEAD AND HAD MANAGED TO PROVOKE A NORTHERN REBELLION AGAINST HIM 
HE'D BEEN FLEECING ABBEYS AND MONASTERIES 
CREATING HIS OWN PRIVATE ARMY AND GENERALLY ACTING LIKE A GREEDY TYRANNICAL BRAT 
INEVITABLY THE LOCAL NOBLES ROSE AGAINST HIM DECLARED HIM OUTLAW 
AND PUT IN THEIR OWN MAN TO BE THE NEW EARL 
HAROLD WAS SENT BY KING EDWARD TO SORT OUT THE MESS AND IMMEDIATELY WAS FACED WITH TWO TOUGH CHOICES 
HE COULD BACK HIS YOUNGER BROTHER TOSTIG AGAINST THE REBELS BUT THAT MIGHT CREATE A CIVIL WAR 
OR HE COULD FORGET ALL ABOUT BLOOD TIES AND SUPPORT TOSTIG'S ENEMIES 
IN RETURN THEY MIGHT FEEL GRATEFUL ENOUGH TO OFFER HIM THEIR SUPPORT 
WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS BID FOR THE ENGLISH THRONE 
IN THE END HAROLD PUT AMBITION BEFORE BROTHERLY LOVE 
HE THREW OUT TOSTIG AND REPLACED HIM WITH THE EARL MORCAR HAROLD HAD BROKEN GODWIN CLAN SOLIDARITY 
AND TURNED HIS OWN BROTHER INTO A MORTAL ENEMY 
IT WAS THIS MERCILESS WAR OF BROTHERS WHICH IN THE END COST HAROLD HIS THRONE AND HIS LIFE 
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE DEATH OF ANGLO SAXON ENGLAND 
THE WINTER OF ONE THOUSAND SIXTY FIVE WAS MARKED BY TREMENDOUS GALES 
WHICH DESTROYED CHURCHES AND UPROOTED GREAT TREES 
AS KING EDWARD THE CONFESSOR LAY ON HIS DEATHBED HE WAS VISITED BY A STRANGE AND TERRIBLE DREAM 
WHICH HE INSISTED ON RELATING TO ALL THOSE WHO HAD GATHERED AROUND HIM 
TWO MONKS TOLD ME THAT BECAUSE OF THE SINS OF ITS PEOPLE GOD HAD GIVEN ENGLAND TO EVIL SPIRITS 
I SAID TO THEM WILL GOD NOT HAVE MERCY AND THEY REPLIED 
NOT UNTIL A GROWING TREE CLEFT IN TWO BY A LIGHTING STORM 
SHOULD COME TOGETHER OF ITS OWN ACCORD AND GROW GREEN AGAIN ONLY THEN WILL THERE BE PARDON 
BUT NO ONE PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO THE RAVINGS OF AN OLD MAN 
WHAT WAS MORE IMPORTANT WAS THAT EDWARD HAD TOUCHED HAROLD'S HAND 
MADDENINGLY THE KING HAD FALLEN SHORT OF DECLARING HIM HIS HEIR 
BUT IT WAS ENOUGH OF A SIGN FOR HAROLD AND FOR THE NORTHERN EARLS WHO SUPPORTED HIM 
ON JANUARY THE SIXTH ONE THOUSAND SIXTY SIX WESTMINSTER SAW THE FUNERAL OF ONE KING IN THE MORNING 
AND THE CORONATION OF ANOTHER IN THE AFTERNOON 
THERE ARE TWO HAROLDS DEPICTED IN THE BAYEUX TAPESTRY BUT WHICH WAS THE REAL ONE 
THE CONFIDENT KING WHO ISSUED COINS BEARING THE OPTIMISTIC SLOGAN PAX THE LATIN FOR PEACE 
OR THE GUILTY TWISTED USURPER STRICKEN BY OMENS HAUNTED BY A VISION OF SHIPS 
THE PHANTOM FLEET WHICH THE EMBROIDERERS SET IN THE BORDER OF THE TAPESTRY 
SUGGESTS HAROLD COULD ALL TOO WELL IMAGINE THE REACTION ACROSS THE CHANNEL TO HIS CORONATION 
A NORMAN HISTORIAN HAS WILLIAM HEARING THE NEWS WHILE OUT HUNTING 
WHEN THE DUKE HEARD THE NEWS HE BECAME AS A MAN OUTRAGED 
OFT HE TIED HIS MANTEL OFT HE UNTIED IT AGAIN AND SPOKE TO NO MAN 
NEITHER DARED ANY MAN SPEAK TO HIM 
FOR TEN YEARS WILLIAM HAD LET IT BE KNOWN THROUGHOUT EUROPE THAT HE'D SOON ADD ENGLAND TO HIS TERRITORIES 
HE WAS IN THE LETHALLY DANGEROUS POSITION OF LOOKING RIDICULOUS 
HE CONSULTED WITH HIS FEUDAL MAGNATES IN A SERIES OF ASSEMBLIES 
BY NO MEANS ALL OF THEM WERE THRILLED WITH THE IDEA OF INVADING ENGLAND 
THE RISKS SEEMED A LOT MORE DAUNTING THAN THE ENTICEMENT OF NEW LANDS AND WEALTH 
SO THE DUKE WENT TO STRATEGY NUMBER TWO TURNING THE MATTER INTO AN INTERNATIONAL CRUSADE 
COULDN'T THE POPE SEE THAT HIS CAUSE WAS JUST 
THAT HAROLD WAS AN INFAMOUS OATH BREAKER A DESPOILER OF CHURCHES 
WHILE WILLIAM WAS A BUILDER OF ABBEYS A PROTECTOR OF BISHOPS AGAINST BULLYING BARONS 
IT WAS ALL COMPLETELY ABSURD AND IT WORKED LIKE A DREAM 
THE POPE WAS WON OVER GAVE WILLIAM HIS PAPAL BLESSING AND INVESTED HIM WITH HIS RING AND HIS BANNER 
IT WAS NOW MUCH MORE THAN A DYNASTIC FEUD 
WILLIAM USED THE CONSECRATION OF HIS WIFE'S ABBEY HERE AT LA TRINITE IN CAEN 
TO PROCLAIM A CRUSADE AGAINST THE INFIDEL HAROLD 
AND THE BARONS WHO'D FOUGHT SHY OF RISKING THEIR NECKS ON THE DUKE'S PERSONAL VENDETTA 
NOW FLOCKED TO JOIN THE LEGIONS OF THE BLESSED 
THE BAYEUX TAPESTRY SHOWS WORK GOT UNDER WAY IMMEDIATELY TO BUILD AN AWE INSPIRING EXPEDITIONARY FORCE 
ROWS OF NORMANDY TREES WENT DOWN TO THE AXE TO EMERGE AS FOUR HUNDRED DRAGON HEADED SHIPS 
LOADED ONTO THE SHIPS WERE COATS OF MAIL BOWS ARROWS SPEARS 
AND THE MOST INDISPENSABLE ITEM OF ALL VAST CASKS OF WINE 
AND PACKED SO TIGHTLY INTO THE BOATS THAT THEY SUPPORTED EACH OTHER 
WERE PERHAPS SIX THOUSAND HORSES THREE FOR EACH KNIGHT 
ACROSS THE CHANNEL HAROLD RESPONDED BY PROVING HE TOO WAS A PHENOMENAL MILITARY ORGANISER 
AS THE CRACK TROOPS OF HIS ARMY HAROLD COULD CALL ON THE ELITE OF PERHAPS THREE THOUSAND HOUSECARLS 
PROFESSIONAL SOLDIERS TRAINED TO HANDLE A TWO HANDED AXE 
THAT COULD SLICE RIGHT THROUGH A HORSE AND ITS RIDER AT ONE BLOW 
THE CORE OF THE ARMY WAS PROVIDED BY THE FIVE THOUSAND THANES OR NOBLEMEN OF ENGLAND 
IN ADDITION THERE WERE THE THIRTEEN THOUSAND PART TIME SOLDIERS 
KNOWN AS THE FYRD WHO WERE OBLIGED TO GIVE THE KING TWO MONTHS' SERVICE EACH YEAR 
WITH AMAZING SPEED THIS ARMY WAS STATIONED ALONG THE SOUTH COAST 
BY AUGUST THE TENTH WILLIAM HAD HIS ARMY IN PLACE ALONG THE NORMANDY COAST 
TWO GREAT FIGHTING FORCES BENT ON EACH OTHER'S ANNIHILATION 
FACED EACH OTHER ACROSS A LITTLE STRIP OF WATER TO DETERMINE THE DESTINY OF ENGLAND 
AND THERE THEY SAT 
WILLIAM WAITING FOR A SOUTHERLY WIND THAT NEVER CAME AND HAROLD WAITING FOR WILLIAM WHO NEVER CAME 
THIS WAITING WAS PARTICULARLY SERIOUS FOR HAROLD BY THE FIRST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 
HE KEPT THE FYRD IN BATTLE POSITION FOR AT LEAST TWO WEEKS LONGER THAN THEIR TWO MONTH OBLIGATION 
WHAT'S MORE IT WAS NOW HARVEST TIME 
SO WITH WHO KNOWS WHAT MISGIVINGS AND UNEASINESS 
ON SEPTEMBER THE EIGHTH HAROLD DEMOBILISED THE FYRD AND SENT THE SOLDIERS HOME 
HE WAS RIGHT TO FEEL UNEASY 
JUST ELEVEN DAYS LATER HAROLD HAD A VERY NASTY SHOCK HIS YOUNGER BROTHER WAS BACK 
TOSTIG AND A NORWEGIAN KING HARALD HARDRADA HAD LANDED IN NORTHUMBRIA WITH AS MANY AS TWELVE THOUSAND MEN 
TOSTIG HAD SPENT HIS TIME IN EXILE LOOKING FOR ALLIES TO PURSUE HIS VENDETTA AGAINST HAROLD 
IT WAS A REAL COUP FOR HIM THAT HE'D FINALLY ENLISTED THE SUPPORT OF THE AWESOME KING OF NORWAY 
HARDRADA WAS QUITE SIMPLY THE MOST FEARED WARRIOR OF THE AGE 
BUILT LIKE A NORWEGIAN CLIFF FACE 
HE HAD A REPUTATION FOR SUPERHUMAN STRENGTH AND ELABORATELY CREATIVE CRUELTY 
HARDRADA ALSO HAD A FLIMSY CLAIM TO THE ENGLISH THRONE THAT WENT BACK TO CANUTE 
AND HE WASN'T ONE TO FLINCH AT A MILITARY CHALLENGE THAT COULD WIN HIM THE DISPUTED CROWN 
HAROLD HARDRADA SAILED SOUTHWEST FROM NORWAY ON AUGUST THE TWELFTH 
EN ROUTE TO ENGLAND HE STOPPED HERE IN THE VIKING EARLDOM OF THE ORKNEYS 
TO PICK UP YET MORE MEN AND SHIPS TO ADD TO HIS ALREADY FORMIDABLE FLEET 
EXPECTATIONS MUST HAVE BEEN HIGH THE NORSEMEN COULD ALMOST SMELL TRIUMPH IN THE SUMMER WINDS 
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN FEASTING 
SINGING AND THE READING OF POEMS SOME DOUBTLESS WRITTEN BY HARDRADA HIMSELF 
AND IT MAY BE HERE THAT TOSTIG JOINED THE VIKING FLEET 
IF HE DID AND IF HE LOOKED OUT AT THE WATER AND SAW THE THREE HUNDRED SHIPS 
HIS LITTLE HEART MUST HAVE SKIPPED A BEAT TO THINK OF THE CATASTROPHE AWAITING HIS BROTHER 
TOGETHER TOSTIG AND HARDRADA WOULD BE UNSTOPPABLE INVINCIBLE 
OR WOULD THEY 
HAVING LANDED ON THE NORTHUMBRIAN COAST 
THE VIKING ARMY HEADED FOR YORK WHERE IT FOUGHT OFF THE NORTHERN EARLS TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE CITY 
COMPLACENT WITH VICTORY HARDRADA AND TOSTIG TRAVELLED WITH JUST ONE THIRD OF THEIR ARMY 
EIGHT MILES EAST OF YORK TO STAMFORD BRIDGE WHERE THEY HAD ARRANGED TO COLLECT FIVE HUNDRED HOSTAGES 
BUT WHAT THEY SAW ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER DERWENT WAS NOT A FORLORN GROUP OF HOSTAGES 
BUT A MASSIVE ARMY THEIR WEAPONS GLITTERING LIKE SHEETS OF ICE AS THE VIKING BARD PUT IT 
TOSTIG KNEW IT MEANT TROUBLE IT WAS HIS BIG BROTHER 
GETTING HIS ARMY IN POSITION TO SURPRISE THE NORSEMEN WAS AN EPIC FEAT BY ANY STANDARDS 
HAROLD HAD TRAVELLED FROM LONDON PICKING UP HIS ARMY ON THE WAY 
COVERING ONE EIGHTY SEVEN MILES IN FOUR DAYS THIRTY SEVEN TO FORTY FIVE MILES A DAY 
IMAGINE THEN THOUSANDS OF MEN GOING AS FAST AS THEIR HORSES 
OR IN MANY CASES AS FAST AS THEIR LEGS COULD CARRY THEM 
UP THE GREAT NORTH ROAD TO PETERBOROUGH LINCOLN TADCASTER 
THE ULTIMATE HIGH IMPACT HIKE WITH THE HEAVIEST BACKPACKS IMAGINABLE 
AND AT THE END OF IT HAROLD FOUGHT ONE OF THE BLOODIEST BATTLES IN ENGLISH HISTORY 
IT WAS THE ENGLISH WHO BROKE THE VIKING LINE AND THE REMAINING NORSE WARRIORS COWERED ROUND THEIR CHIEFS 
WE MUST IMAGINE THE GREAT HARDRADA SWINGING HIS AXE BENEATH THE LAND WASTER FLAG 
BEFORE FINALLY SINKING DOWN WITH AN ARROW IN THE THROAT 
TOSTIG PICKING UP THE RAVEN FLAG AND IN HIS TURN BEING CUT DOWN 
THE CARNAGE WAS SO COMPLETE THAT IT TOOK JUST TWENTY FOUR OF THE THREE HUNDRED SHIPS THAT HAD SAILED TO ENGLAND 
TO RETURN THE PITIFUL REMNANT OF THE NORSE ARMY BACK TO NORWAY 
IN A FINAL ACT OF RESPECT HAROLD FOUND HIS DEAD BROTHER 
AND TOOK WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIM TO BE BURIED AT YORK MINSTER 
BUT HE HAD NO TIME TO GRIEVE OR EXULT OVER THE DEATH OF TOSTIG 
FOR THE DAY AFTER THE BATTLE OF STAMFORD BRIDGE 
THE NORMAN FLEET AT LAST FELT THE WIND CHANGE DIRECTION 
WITH GREAT HASTE THE DUKE WENT TO SEA WITH HIS FLEET SAILING SWIFTLY TO THE COAST OF ENGLAND 
THEIR FIRST SIGHT OF LAND WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CLIFFS AT BEACHY HEAD 
AND THEY LANDED IN THE NEARBY SHELTERING HARBOURS OF PEVENSEY 
AN OLD ROMAN FORT GUARDED THE BEACH 
WITHIN ITS EMPTY SHELL WILLIAM'S MEN ERECTED A PREFABRICATED TIMBER CASTLE LATER REBUILT IN STONE 
AS IF DECLARING THAT THEY WERE NOW THE HEIRS TO THE ROMANS 
EXPEDITIONS FOR FOOD AND FORAGE FROM THE BASE CAMP TOOK THE USUAL FORM 
BURNING EVERYTHING THAT COULDN'T BE SEIZED STRIKING TERROR INTO THE HEARTS OF THE LOCALS 
ONE OF THE MOST UNFORGETTABLE DETAILS IN THE BAYEUX TAPESTRY IS THIS SEEMINGLY INCIDENTAL DETAIL 
OF A MOTHER AND CHILD TURNED REFUGEE 
FLEEING FROM THEIR BURNING HOUSE MAYBE EVEN HASTINGS 
RESIGNED TO THEIR FATE NOT LOOKING BACK 
THIS IS THE FIRST OF THE IMAGES THAT WILL ECHO THROUGH EUROPEAN ART 
THROUGH RUBENS GOYA AND PICASSO'S GUERNICA 
OF THE VICTIMS OF WAR OF CIVILIANS OF INNOCENTS 
BUT WILLIAM SOON DISCOVERED THERE WAS NO EASY ROUTE TO GET FROM PEVENSEY TO LONDON 
THE COUNTRY BEHIND THE TOWN WAS WATERLOGGED CROSSED BY LITTLE RIVER VALLEYS THAT FED INTO THE SEA 
BUT THERE WAS ONE OLD ANGLO SAXON TRAIL THAT COULD TAKE HIM TO THE ROMAN ROAD GOING NORTH THROUGH KENT 
AND IT WAS FOR MASTERY OF THIS ANCIENT MUDDY RUTTED TRACK 
THAT THE MOST GRUELLING BATTLE IN EARLY BRITISH HISTORY WOULD BE FOUGHT 
HAVING BEATEN BACK THE THREAT OF THE VIKINGS AND HIS OWN BROTHER 
IT MUST HAVE SEEMED INCONCEIVABLE TO HAROLD THAT HE'D HAVE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN WITHIN A WEEK OR TWO 
IT WOULD NOT BE EASY WHO COULD HE CALL ON THE BRUISED AND BATTERED REMAINS OF HIS ARMY 
IT WOULD BE A LONG SHOT BUT AFTER STAMFORD BRIDGE PERHAPS HAROLD FELT HE COULD TRUST HIS LUCK 
BESIDES WILLIAM'S PUBLIC NAME CALLING HAROLD THE PERJURED HAROLD THE OATH BREAKER 
HAROLD THE PERFIDIOUS HAD MADE IT PERSONAL NOW A MORTAL DUEL 
LET THE HAND OF GOD DECIDE WHO WAS THE RIGHTEOUS PARTY WHO WOULD PREVAIL 
HAROLD LEFT LONDON AT FULL SPEED 
HE GATHERED WHAT HE COULD OF A NEW ARMY BY AN OLD GREY APPLE TREE 
AN ANCIENT BLASTED TREE THAT STOOD ON A HILL AT THE CROSSING OF THE TRACKS LEADING OUT OF HASTINGS 
THERE HAROLD PLANTED HIS BANNER THE DRAGON OF WESSEX 
THE NORMANS CALLED THIS PLACE SENLAC WHICH MEANS LAKE OF BLOOD 
IMAGINE YOURSELF THEN ON THE MORNING OF SATURDAY THE FOURTEENTH OF OCTOBER ONE THOUSAND SIXTY SIX 
YOU'RE A SAXON WARRIOR A HOUSECARL AS IT HAPPENS AND YOU'VE SURVIVED STAMFORD BRIDGE 
YOUR POSITION HERE COULDN'T BE BETTER 
YOU STAND ON THE BROW OF THE HILL LOOK DOWN HUNDREDS OF YARDS AWAY AT THE OPPOSITION 
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PREVENT THE NORMANS BREAKING THROUGH TO THE LONDON ROAD 
THEY HAVE THE HORSES BUT THEN THEY HAVE TO RIDE THEM UPHILL 
ALONG THE HILLSIDE YOU SEE A DENSELY PACKED CROWD OF ENGLISHMEN 
AT THE FRONT ARE THE HOUSECARLS A WALL OF SOLID SHIELDS AND WITH THEM THE AXEMEN 
BUT BEHIND THEM THE PART TIMERS THE FIGHTING FARMERS WHO MUST HAVE TIME TO FIND THEIR COURAGE 
DOWN AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL YOU CAN HEAR THE WHINNYING OF NORMAN HORSES 
AND WHAT SOUNDS LIKE THE CHANTING OF PSALMS 
YOU'RE A NORMAN FOOT SOLDIER 
AND YOU HOPE TO GOD THE GENTLEMEN ON HORSES KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
ALL AROUND YOU YOU CAN HEAR THE SCRAPING OF METAL THE SHARPENING OF BLADES THE MOUNTING OF HORSES 
ON THE BROW OF THE HILL YOU SEE A THIN GLITTERING LINE OF MEN 
YOU CROSS YOURSELF AND YOU FINGER THE RINGS ON YOUR COAT OF MAIL AND WONDER HOW SOLID THEY ARE 
YOU WONDER WHAT USE THEY'RE GOING TO BE AGAINST AN AXE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN AXES IN BATTLE BEFORE 
BUT THEN YOU CATCH SIGHT OF THE PAPAL BANNER AND TAKE HEART SURELY GOD IS ON YOUR SIDE 
THE REAL BEGINNING MUST BE IMAGINED AS THE CAVALRY RACED UP THE HILL ONE BY ONE GETTING INTO RANGE 
HEARING THE RHYTHMIC CHANT OF OOT OOT OUT OUT FROM THE SAXONS 
AND THEN HURLING THEIR JAVELINS AT THE FRONT LINE 
THEN CAME THE SLOW ADVANCE OF THE ARCHERS UNLOOSING THEIR FIRST ARROWS UNDER A HAIL OF ENEMY SPEARS 
AND FINALLY THE FOOT SOLDIERS BREAKING INTO A RUN BEHIND THEM 
THEN THERE WAS JUST THE MURDEROUS SMASHING AND CRASHING OF HORSES SLICING AND THRUSTING OF WEAPONS 
THE SCREAMS CRIES OF THE WOUNDED AND DYING 
IF THE AXEMAN STOOD FIRM AGAINST THE ONCOMING HORSE HE'D STILL ONLY GET ONE GOOD SWING 
IF HE MISSED HE WAS LEFT OPEN TO THE SLASH OF THE SWORD FROM THE RIDER ABOVE 
IT WAS THE INITIAL SUCCESS OF THE ENGLISH THAT ALSO THREATENED THEIR DOWNFALL 
ON THE LEFT FLANK OF WILLIAM'S ARMY HORSES STUMBLED AND RETREATED 
THE RIGHT FLANK OF HAROLD'S ARMY MANY OF THEM INEXPERIENCED FYRDMEN DECIDED TO CHASE THEM DOWN THE HILL 
BUT HAROLD ALWAYS CONSERVATIVE IN HIS TACTICS REFUSED TO ALLOW OTHERS TO FOLLOW 
HE SEEMS TO HAVE LOST MOMENTARY CONTROL OF HIS TROOPS 
WHO COULDN'T RESIST FOLLOWING THE HORSEMEN ELATED BY THE THOUGHT THAT THE DUKE OF NORMANDY WAS LOST 
BUT WILLIAM THREW BACK HIS HELMET TO PROVE HE WAS VERY MUCH ALIVE 
HE RALLIED THE RANKS OF THE NORMAN CENTRE ROUND THE REAR OF THE PURSUING SAXONS 
AND SET ABOUT SLICING THEM TO PIECES 
THE BATTLE WASN'T OVER YET 
IT WOULD TAKE AT LEAST SIX HOURS TO DECIDE 
THE BAYEUX TAPESTRY IS SHOCKINGLY EXPLICIT IN EXPOSING THE EXTENT OF THE CARNAGE AND MUTILATION 
BUT IT WAS THE ENGLISH ARMY THAT WAS EVENTUALLY AND VERY VERY SLOWLY GROUND DOWN 
WILLIAM EXPLOITED WEAK POINTS SETTLING INTO AN ALTERNATING RHYTHM OF ARCHERS AND CAVALRY 
THE ARROWS NOW SHOT HIGH INTO THE AIR AND FELL NOT ON THE FRONT LINE 
BUT THE HEADS OF UNPROTECTED MEN BEHIND THEM 
HOW DID HAROLD HIMSELF DIE LATELY THERE'S BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO READ THE DEATH SCENE IN THE TAPESTRY 
AS THOUGH HE WAS THE FIGURE CUT DOWN BY THE HORSEMEN 
NOT THE WARRIOR PULLING THE ARROW OUT OF HIS EYE THE STORY YOU AND I GREW UP WITH BUT IT SEEMS CLEAR 
THAT THE WORDS HAROLD REX OCCUR DIRECTLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE THE ARROW STRUCK FIGURE 
THEN CERTAINLY THE KNIGHTS WOULD HAVE BEEN ON HIM CUTTING HIM DOWN LEAVING HIM DISEMBOWELLED 
THE THANES BRAVELY MOUNTED A LAST STAND DEFENDING THE BODY OF THEIR KING 
BUT FOR MANY IT WAS A LOST CAUSE IT WAS TIME TO SAVE ONE'S NECK TO GET OUT OF THE WAY 
THERE ARE SUCH SAD STORIES OF WHAT FOLLOWS AND PERHAPS SOME ARE TRUE 
ONE OF THEM HAS HAROLD'S LOVER EDITH SWAN NECK WALKING THROUGH THE HEAPS OF GORY CORPSES 
TO IDENTIFY THE DEAD KING BY MARKS ON HIS BODY KNOWN ONLY TO HER 
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT AROUND HALF THE NOBILITY OF ENGLAND PERISHED ON THAT BATTLEFIELD 
WILLIAM HAD SWORN THAT SHOULD GOD GIVE HIM THE VICTORY 
HE WOULD BUILD A GREAT ABBEY OF THANKSGIVING AT THE EXACT SPOT WHERE HAROLD HAD PLANTED HIS FLAG 
HERE IT IS A STATEMENT IF EVER THERE WAS ONE OF PIOUS JUBILATION 
BUT WILLIAM HAD TO MAKE SURE HE'D WON NOT JUST A SINGLE BATTLE BUT THE WAR FOR ENGLAND 
THIS WAS DONE IN THE TIME HONOURED WAY 
CUTTING A SWATH OF FIRE RAPE AND PLUNDER THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE OF SOUTH EAST ENGLAND 
ONE BY ONE THE ANGLO SAXON CITIES FOLDED 
WILLIAM WAS CROWNED AT WESTMINSTER ON CHRISTMAS DAY ONE THOUSAND SIXTY SIX 
BUT THE EVENT WAS MORE LIKE A SHAMBLES THAN A TRIUMPH 
AT THE SHOUT OF ACCLAMATION 
THE NORMAN SOLDIERS STATIONED OUTSIDE THOUGHT A RIOT HAD STARTED 
TO WHICH THEIR RESPONSE WAS TO BURN DOWN EVERY HOUSE IN SIGHT 
AS FIGHTING BROKE OUT MANY OF THOSE IN THE ABBEY SMELLING SMOKE RUSHED OUTSIDE 
AND THE CEREMONY WAS COMPLETED IN A HALF EMPTY INTERIOR WITH WILLIAM 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE SEEN TO BE SHAKING LIKE A LEAF 
WHEN HE EMERGED FROM THE SMOKE AND CHAOS OF THE CORONATION 
JUST WHAT KIND OF KING DID THE SURVIVING REMNANT OF THE OLD GOVERNING CLASS IMAGINE THEY HAD 
DID THEY FONDLY SUPPOSE HE WAS GOING TO BE ANOTHER CANUTE 
WHO NOW HE'D WON HIS REALM WOULD DISBAND HIS ARMY AND SEND THEM HOME 
IF THEY DID THEY WERE IN FOR A VERY NASTY SHOCK 
BECAUSE EVEN IF WILLIAM HAD WANTED TO DO THIS IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE 
HIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN HAD BEEN BASED ON THE PROMISE OF THE LURE OF LAND 
THE PLEDGE TO HAND OVER SAXON LAND ON A GOLDEN PLATE OF CONQUEST 
THERE WAS NEVER THE REMOTEST CHANCE THAT WILLIAM WOULD BE ANOTHER CANUTE 
AND ASSIMILATE HIMSELF INTO THE WORLD OF ANGLO SAXON ENGLAND HIS CONQUEST TURNED THE COUNTRY AROUND 
ENGLAND'S ORIENTATION NOW WAS SOUTH AWAY FROM SCANDINAVIA AND TOWARDS CONTINENTAL EUROPE 
THE NORTH OF ENGLAND WHICH STILL RETAINED STRONG VIKING SYMPATHIES OFFERED THE MOST RESISTANCE 
THREE YEARS INTO WILLIAM'S REIGN YORK OPENED ITS GATES TO KING SWEYN OF DENMARK 
HAILING HIM AS A LIBERATOR FROM THE NEW KING OF ENGLAND 
WILLIAM'S RESPONSE WAS TO MOUNT A CAMPAIGN OF OPPRESSION IN THE NORTH 
THAT WAS NOT JUST PUNITIVE BUT AN EXERCISE IN MASS MURDER 
THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF MEN AND BOYS GRUESOMELY BUTCHERED THEIR BODIES LEFT TO ROT AND FESTER 
EVERY TOWN AND VILLAGE BURNT WITHOUT PITY 
FIELDS AND LIVESTOCK DESTROYED SO COMPLETELY THAT ANY SURVIVORS WERE DOOMED TO DIE IN A GREAT FAMINE 
HARD ON THE HEELS OF MASSACRE AND STARVATION CAME PLAGUE 
AND ALL ACROSS ENGLAND WILLIAM BUILT AT LEAST NINETY CASTLES 
DOMINATING AREAS OF POTENTIAL REVOLT 
ENGINES OF TERROR THAT HELPED WILLIAM CONTROL OVER TWO MILLION SAXONS WITH JUST TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND NORMANS 
MOST OF THE VOICES DESCRIBING TO US THE EVENTS AFTER ONE THOUSAND SIXTY SIX ARE WRITTEN FROM THE VICTOR'S PERSPECTIVE 
UNAPOLOGETIC AND CROWING SKETCHING THE STARKEST POSSIBLE CONTRAST 
BETWEEN THE MACHIAVELLIAN PERJURER HAROLD AND THE NOBLE BETRAYED WILLIAM 
BUT AMONG THIS RATHER NAUSEATING CHORUS OF CONGRATULATION THERE IS AT LEAST ONE THAT DARES BREAK RANK 
THAT IN FACT SEES THE CONQUEST AS IT SURELY WAS 
A BRUTAL RUTHLESS AND COMPLETELY SUCCESSFUL ACT OF AGGRESSION AND CRUELTY 
THE VOICE IS ALL THE MORE CREDIBLE BECAUSE IT BELONGS TO SOMEONE WHO BY RIGHTS 
SHOULD HAVE FOUND NOTHING TO FAULT IN THE NORMAN CONQUEST 
THE MONK ORDERIC VITALIS WHOSE FAMILY CAME OVER WITH WILLIAM AND BELONGED TO THE CONQUERING CLASS 
IN THE EARLY TWELFTH CENTURY HE BEGAN TO PEN HIS ACCOUNT OF THE CONQUEST 
IN COMPLETE CONTRAST TO THE OTHERS ORDERIC NEVER MINCES HIS WORDS ABOUT WHAT HE THOUGHT OF AS COLONISATION 
FOREIGNERS GREW WEALTHY WITH THE SPOILS OF ENGLAND WHILE HER OWN SONS WERE EITHER SHAMEFULLY SLAIN 
OR DRIVEN AS EXILES TO WANDER HOPELESSLY THROUGH FOREIGN KINGDOMS 
HIS ACCOUNT CONVEYS THE TRAUMATIC MAGNITUDE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN ENGLAND IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING ONE THOUSAND SIXTY SIX 
PRE CONQUEST ENGLAND WAS AN OLD COUNTRY AS ORDERIC DESCRIBES IT 
AFTERWARDS IT WAS A COMPLETELY NEW ONE 
OF COURSE NOT EVERYTHING CHANGED 
TO LOOK AT A LIST OF GOVERNING INSTITUTIONS YOU MIGHT SUPPOSE THAT NOTHING HAD CHANGED 
THAT ONE CLASS OF GOVERNORS HAD KICKED OUT ANOTHER CLASS BIG DEAL 
BUT I RATHER THINK IT WAS A BIG DEAL 
IMAGINE THE COUNTY GENTRY OF ENGLAND PRIESTS SQUIRES JUDGES ALL WIPED OUT OVERNIGHT 
HALF OF THEM DEAD THE REST HUMILIATED BROKEN REPLACED BY AN ALIEN CLASS 
THEY SPEAK DIFFERENTLY THEY LOOK DIFFERENT 
THEY TAKE WHAT THEY WANT WHEN THEY WANT AND RUBBER STAMP THE DECISION IN YOUR COURTS 
THEY ALSO BUILD DIFFERENTLY 
ELY CATHEDRAL IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES 
WHERE THE INTIMATE SCALE OF SAXON CHURCHES WAS REPLACED BY A STATEMENT OF MASSIVE TRIUMPHALISM 
THESE COLUMNS SPEAK OF AUTHORITY AND RAW POWER 
THEY COMMAND OBEDIENCE AND REVERENCE THEY ARE IN THE MOST LITERAL SENSE AWESOME 
IT WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMMENSE ROMANESQUE BULK OF THE GREAT NORMAN CATHEDRALS 
AND THE SMALL SPACES OF THE SAXON CHAPEL 
THERE WAS ANOTHER TELLING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OLD AND NEW RULERS OF ENGLAND 
ANGLO SAXONS DIDN'T USE SURNAMES THEY WERE CEDRIC OR EDGAR OF SOMEWHERE OR OTHER 
BUT THE NORMANS INCORPORATED PLACES INTO THEIR OWN NAMES LIKE AN ACT OF POSSESSION 
THEY WERE ROGER OF THE BEAUTIFUL HILL ROGER BEAUMONT 
BECAUSE THE PLACE WAS THEIRS THEY OWNED IT LOCK STOCK AND BARREL 
IN FACT PRESERVING THE ESTATE INTACT WAS WHAT THE NORMAN NOBILITY WAS ALL ABOUT 
IT WAS THEY WHO INTRODUCED THE PRACTICE OF PASSING ON WHOLE ESTATES INTACT TO ONE HEIR THE ELDEST SON 
THE UNSENTIMENTAL DECISIVE WAY WITH THINGS WAS THE NORMAN WAY 
GIVING A HARD NOSED EDGE 
TO THE FUZZY TANGLES OF CONTRACTS AND CUSTOMS THAT HAD BEEN USED BY THE ANGLO SAXONS 
AND IT WAS IN THIS SPIRIT THAT WILLIAM IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHTY FIVE 
HELD COURT IN GLOUCESTER AND LAUNCHED ARGUABLY THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CAMPAIGN OF HIS REIGN 
A CAMPAIGN FOR INFORMATION 
WE TEND TO THINK OF WILLIAM AS MORE OR LESS PERMANENTLY IN THE SADDLE 
HE GREW UP IN A WORLD AFTER ALL WHERE AUTHORITY WAS USUALLY DELIVERED ON THE BLADE OF A SWORD 
SO IT'S ALL THE MORE IMPRESSIVE THAT HE SEEMS TO HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT INFORMATION COULD ALSO BE POWER 
WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR WAS THE FIRST DATABASE KING 
HIS IMMEDIATE NEED WAS TO RAISE A TAX 
BUT THE COMPILATION OF THE DOMESDAY BOOK WAS MORE THAN JUST A GLORIFIED AUDIT 
WHO HAD OWNED WHAT BEFORE THE COMING OF THE NORMANS AND WHO OWNED WHAT NOW 
HOW MUCH IT HAD BEEN WORTH THEN AND HOW MUCH NOW 
THE KING SENT HIS MEN ALL OVER ENGLAND INTO EVERY SHIRE 
AND HAD THEM FIND OUT HOW MANY HIDES THERE WERE IN EACH SHIRE 
WHAT LAND AND CATTLE THE KING HIMSELF HAD IN THE COUNTY 
SO VERY NARROWLY DID HE HAVE IT INVESTIGATED THERE WAS NO SINGLE HIDE NOR SHAME TO RELATE IT 
BUT IT SEEMED NO SHAME TO HIM WAS THERE ONE OX OR ONE COW LEFT OUT AND NOT PUT DOWN IN RECORD 
WHILE SOME OF THE INFORMATION WAS TAKEN VERBALLY BY WILLIAM'S SCRIBES 
SOME MUST HAVE OWED ITS EXISTENCE TO SAXON RECORDS 
THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY PARADOX ABOUT THE DOMESDAY BOOK 
IS THAT WHAT WE THINK OF AS A MONUMENT TO NORMAN POWER AND STRENGTH 
OWED ITSELF TO THE ADVANCED MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT LEFT BEHIND BY THE OLD ANGLO SAXON MONARCHY 
AND IT WAS THANKS TO THIS THAT THE DATA WAS COLLECTED AT SUCH LIGHTNING SPEED LESS THAN SIX MONTHS 
THE RESULTS WERE PRESENTED TO WILLIAM HERE AT OLD SARUM 
AN ANCIENT IRON AGE FORT INSIDE WHICH HE'D BUILT A ROYAL PALACE 
WHEN GIVEN THE DOMESDAY BOOK IT WAS AS IF WILLIAM HAD BEEN HANDED THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM AGAIN 
AS IF HE'D RECONQUERED ENGLAND STATISTICALLY 
BECAUSE ITS INFORMATION WAS MORE IMPREGNABLE THAN ANY CASTLE 
IT WAS CALLED THE DOMESDAY BOOK BECAUSE IT WAS SAID ITS DECISIONS WERE AS FINAL AS THE LAST JUDGMENT 
THE CHURCH ITSELF HOLDS WENLOCK THERE ARE FORTY HIDES FOUR OF WHICH ARE EXEMPT FROM TAX UNDER KING CANUTE 
THERE ARE FIFTEEN SLAVES TWO MILLS SERVE THE MONKS PLUS ONE FISHERY 
ENOUGH WOODLAND TO FATTEN THREE HUNDRED PIGS AND TWO HEDGED ENCLOSURES VALUE NOW TWELVE POUNDS 
TWO CEREMONIES TOOK PLACE ON LAMMAS DAY ONE THOUSAND EIGHTY SEVEN AT OLD SARUM 
FIRST EVERY NOBLE IN ENGLAND GATHERED HERE TO TAKE AN OATH OF LOYALTY TO THE KING 
AND THEN CAME THE HANDING OVER OF THE BOOK THE ULTIMATE WEAPON TO KEEP THEM IN LINE 
NOW NOBODY COULD HOLD BACK ANYTHING 
AND IT WAS THIS BOOK THE DOMESDAY BOOK 
THAT MADE THE GATHERING AT OLD SARUM UNIQUE IN THE HISTORY OF FEUDAL MONARCHY IN EUROPE 
FOR THE BOOK ULTIMATELY WAS ENGLAND 
FOR CENTURIES AFTER THIS WAS THE SECRET OF ENGLISH GOVERNMENT 
A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE POWER OF THE LANDED CLASSES AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE 
BETWEEN THE GUARDIANS OF THE GREEN ACRES AND THE KEEPERS OF KNOWLEDGE 
IN ONE CORNER THE GENTRY IN THE OTHER CORNER THE CIVIL SERVICE 
AND IN BETWEEN THEM THE ETERNAL UMPIRE THE KING 
BUT THE UMPIRE WAS FINALLY FEELING THE STRAIN 
NOT SURPRISING WHEN AGED SIXTY WILLIAM STILL COULDN'T RESIST PLAYING THE WARLORD 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHTY SEVEN HE SUBDUED A BORDER DISPUTE IN FRANCE BY OF COURSE TOTALLY DESTROYING THE TOWN OF MANTES 
BUT PERHAPS THIS LAST DEVASTATION WAS ONE TOO MANY 
A FLAMING TIMBER FROM ONE OF THE HOUSES BURNED BY WILLIAM'S SOLDIERS FELL RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE KING 
WILLIAM'S HORSE SUDDENLY BUCKED THROWING THE NOW OVERWEIGHT KING VIOLENTLY AGAINST HIS SADDLE 
HIS GUT TOOK THE FORCE OF THE BLOW 
MORTALLY WOUNDED WILLIAM WAS TAKEN TO A PRIORY AT ROUEN 
AT THE VERY END ORDERIC VITALIS PUTS INTO WILLIAM'S MOUTH AN EXTRAORDINARY DEATHBED CONFESSION 
SO PENITENTIAL SO UTTERLY OUT OF CHARACTER THAT IT SEEMS ON THE FACE OF IT COMPLETELY INCREDIBLE 
BUT WHETHER WILLIAM ACTUALLY SPOKE THOSE WORDS OR NOT 
THEY CLEARLY REFLECTED WHAT SOME PERHAPS MANY PEOPLE FELT ABOUT WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR 
WHEN ALL THE BATTLES WERE WON WHEN THE LAWS HAD ALL BEEN LAID DOWN 
HE WAS WHAT HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A BRUTAL ADVENTURER 
AND THE CONQUEST OF ENGLAND NOT A RIGHTEOUS CRUSADE BUT JUST A GRAND THROW OF HISTORY'S DICE 
I APPOINT NO ONE MY HEIR TO THE CROWN OF ENGLAND FOR I DID NOT ATTAIN THAT HIGH HONOUR BY HEREDITARY RIGHT 
BUT WRESTLED IT FROM THE PERJURED KING HAROLD IN A DESPERATE BATTLE WITH MUCH EFFUSION OF HUMAN BLOOD 
I HAVE PERSECUTED ITS NATIVE INHABITANTS BEYOND ALL REASON 
WHETHER GENTLE OR SIMPLE I CRUELLY OPPRESSED THEM MANY I UNJUSTLY DISINHERITED 
INNUMERABLE MULTITUDES ESPECIALLY IN THE COUNTY OF YORK PERISHED THROUGH ME BY FAMINE OR THE SWORD 
HAVING THEREFORE MADE MY WAY TO THE THRONE OF THAT KINGDOM BY SO MANY CRIMES 
I DARE NOT LEAVE IT TO ANYONE BUT GOD ALONE LEST AFTER MY DEATH WORSE SHOULD HAPPEN BY MY MEANS 
ONCE HE HAD GONE IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING OF THE NINTH OF SEPTEMBER ONE THOUSAND EIGHTY SEVEN 
A SHOCKING SCENE TOOK PLACE 
HIS CLOSEST FOLLOWERS NOW PAID THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO WILLIAM BY ALL DESERTING HIM 
RACING OFF AROUND THE KINGDOM TO SECURE THEIR LAND AND PROPERTY 
LEAVING THE CORPSE TO BE LOOTED BY THE SERVANTS 
NAKED BLOATED AND BEGINNING TO PUTREFY ON THE MONASTERY FLOOR 
SO THE MAN WHO'D SPENT HIS LIFE TAKING WHATEVER HE COULD BY WHATEVER MEANS POSSIBLE 
WAS FINALLY ROBBED OF EVERYTHING EVEN HIS DIGNITY 
PERHAPS THE HAND OF GOD HAD DECIDED THAT THIS WAS A FITTING END 
AS FOR HIS OLD ANTAGONIST HAROLD 
HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T STAY BURIED ON THE SHORE FACING THE CHANNEL AS SOME NORMAN HISTORIANS SUGGESTED 
RUMOURS HAD IT THAT HE ESCAPED AND LIVED AS A HERMIT BUT ANOTHER STORY IS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE THE TRUTH 
THAT ONCE IT WAS SAFE 
THE FEMALE SURVIVORS OF THE FAMILY TOOK HAROLD'S REMAINS AND HAD THEM INTERRED HERE AT WALTHAM ABBEY 
ACCORDING TO WILLIAM AND THE POPE HAROLD WAS A DESPOILER OF THE CHURCH DESERVING OF DESTRUCTION 
BUT THE MONKS AT WALTHAM DIDN'T SEEM TO AGREE FOR THEY SECRETLY BURIED HIM AND PRAYED FOR HIS SOUL 
SOMEWHERE THEN BENEATH THE COLUMNS AND ARCHES OF THIS ROMANESQUE CHURCH 
IS THE LAST ANGLO SAXON KING 
LITERALLY PART OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF NORMAN ENGLAND 
THERE'S MUCH MORE TO DISCOVER AND DEBATE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF BRITAIN
