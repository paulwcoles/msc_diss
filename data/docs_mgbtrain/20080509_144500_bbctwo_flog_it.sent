WE'VE GOT TO BE ON OUR BEST BEHAVIOUR IN CASE SOMEONE IMPORTANT POPS IN TO OUR VALUATION DAY 
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST A STONE'S THROW AWAY FROM THE QUEEN'S OFFICIAL RESIDENCE WE'RE IN WINDSOR 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT A FLOG IT VALUATION DAY 
IS YOU NEVER KNOW EXACTLY WHAT OR WHO IS GOING TO TURN UP 
WILL WE FIND ANYTHING WITH A ROYAL CONNECTION IT'S ANYBODY'S GUESS 
ONE THING WE CAN BE SURE OF ALL OF OUR EXPERTS NICK HALL 
ADAM PARTRIDGE AND THOMAS PLANT WILL TREAT EVERYTHING WITH COURTESY AND RESPECT 
WHETHER THEY'RE RAGS OR RICHES WON'T YOU CHAPS OF COURSE WE WILL YES PAUL 
HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE SELLING EVERYTHING LATER ON FOR A RIGHT ROYAL PROFIT 
RIGHT NOW IT'S TIME TO SEE WHAT NICK HAS COME UP WITH 
HELLO JOHN WELCOME TO SUNNY WINDSOR THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IN THIS GREAT LITTLE PLANT POT WITH YOU 
IT CAUGHT MY EYE IN THE QUEUE I LIKED THIS AS SOON AS I SAW IT 
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOU CAN TELL ME ABOUT IT HOW YOU CAME TO OWN IT 
YES WELL IT CAME TO US WHEN MY MOTHER DIED 
SHE WAS ACTUALLY NINETY WHEN SHE DIED 
IT'S BEEN IN YOUR FAMILY A LONG TIME THEN YES AS FAR AS I KNOW IT'S ALWAYS BEEN IN THE FAMILY YES 
SO YOU INHERITED IT YES DO YOU HAVE PLANTS IN IT AT HOME NO WE DON'T 
RELEGATED TO THE CUPBOARD UNDER THE SINK OR SOMEWHERE UP IN THE LOFT 
IT'S A SHAME IT REALLY NEEDS TO COME OUT AND BE APPRECIATED FOR WHAT IT IS 
OBVIOUSLY WE CAN SEE FROM THE MARKS UNDERNEATH THAT IT'S A PIECE OF MINTONS IT'S FULLY MARKED MINTONS 
WE CAN TELL THAT IT'S GOT THE S. ON THE END OF MINTON WHICH SAYS IT'S AFTER ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO 
ALSO WE'VE GOT THE ENGLAND STAMP ON THERE SO IT'S AFTER ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY ONE 
SO WE CAN DATE IT QUITE ACCURATELY 
WE'VE GOT SOME VARIOUS IMPRESSED MARKS WHICH HELP WITH THAT 
I'D DATE THIS TO PROBABLY AROUND ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FIVE NINETEEN HUNDRED THAT SORT OF DATE 
IT FALLS INTO THE CATEGORY THAT WE'D CALL ARTS AND CRAFTS 
IT'S JUST A SHORT PERIOD OF THE LATE VICTORIAN ERA 
AND YOU'VE SOME WONDERFUL DESIGNERS WORKING MINTONS 
A LOT OF THE OTHER GREAT CERAMIC FACTORIES OF THE U. K. 
UM I PARTICULARLY LIKE THE PATTERN OF THE FLOWERS ON THESE 
THERE'S ONE NAME THEY DRAW ME TO CHRISTOPHER DRESSER RIGHT 
IT'S KNOWN THAT HE WAS DOING SOME DESIGNS FOR MINTONS 
AND WE'VE SEEN AND SOLD A LOT OF HIS WORK OVER THE YEARS 
A LOT OF IT'S SIGNED AND IT MAKES A LOT OF MONEY WHEN IT'S SIGNED 
THIS IS ONLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIM BECAUSE IT'S NOT SIGNED I CAN'T SAY IT'S DEFINITELY DRESSER 
WOULD IT DEFINITELY BE SIGNED IF IT WAS NOT ALWAYS IT'S NEVER THAT SIMPLE SADLY 
IT WOULD MAKE OUR JOB HARDER AND WE'D HAVE TO WORK FOR A LIVING RATHER THAN TELLING US EVERYTHING ON THE FRONT 
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE WORTH WELL I THOUGHT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED 
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED NOT A BAD STARTING PRICE 
I'VE HAD A LOOK ROUND IT THE ONLY FAULT I CAN SEE 
IS THERE'S A VERY SMALL HAIRLINE CRACK JUST DOWN THE RIM THERE WE'VE NOTICED THAT 
WE'VE GOT A BIT OF CRAZING UNDER THE GLAZE 
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM IT'S JUST THAT CRACK 
YEAH VALUE WISE IF IT'S JUST A PIECE OF ANONYMOUS MINTONS ART POTTERY OF CIRCA NINETEEN HUNDRED 
IT'S GOING TO MAKE ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MAYBE 
IF THE BUYERS DECIDE YES I THINK IT COULD BE DRESSER WE COULD BE LOOKING AT TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED PERHAPS RIGHT 
SO LET'S GET IT IN WITH A FIRM RESERVE OF SAY ONE HUNDRED SO YOU'RE NOT DISAPPOINTED 
AND THEN FINGERS CROSSED IT'LL MAKE A GOOD SALE FOR YOU AND WE CAN FLOG IT VERY GOOD 
JENNY HELLO TELL ME WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR DECANTER AND STOPPER FROM 
I FOUND IT IN THE SHED WHEN WE MOVED BACK TO MY MOTHER'S FAMILY HOME AND THE SHED WAS FULL 
OF FURNITURE AND VARIOUS BITS AND PIECES THAT HAD BEEN OWNED BY HER PARENTS AND OTHER RELATIVES 
THERE IT WAS AND I WAS SEVEN SO I'VE HAD IT A LITTLE WHILE NOW 
SOME TIME CERTAINLY SO IT'S BEEN WITH YOU YOU KNOW THROUGH THICK AND THIN PROBABLY 
YEAH MOVED HOUSE A FEW TIMES IT'S IN REMARKABLY GOOD CONDITION 
WHY DO YOU RECKON YOUR FAMILY HAD IT 
I DON'T KNOW I IMAGINED IT'S PROBABLY 
EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY 
I DON'T KNOW NO WHAT IT IS IS IT'S NINETEENTH CENTURY 
OH RIGHT IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTIES ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTIES SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
AND IT'S WHAT WE CALL BOHEMIAN GLASS 
BOHEMIAN GLASS BECAUSE IT COMES FROM THAT PART OF THE WORLD 
RIGHT THIS IS A TYPICAL DECORATION AND DESIGN FROM BOHEMIA 
WHAT HAPPENS IS 
GLASS IS BLOWN AND IT'S A CLEAR GLASS 
MM H. M. M. THEN THIS RED RUBY YOU CAN SEE AROUND IT 
IS FLASHED OVER THE GLASS SO THE CLEAR GLASS IS BLOWN 
AND THEN IT'S DIPPED IN A RUBY GLASS AND TAKEN OUT IMMEDIATELY 
OH RIGHT IT'S THEN SHAPED AND LEFT TO COOL 
THEN HOW DOES THE DECORATION GET MADE 
BY A WHEEL ENGRAVER A WHEEL ENGRAVER COMES ALONG AND TAKES AWAY THE RUBY 
TO LEAVE WHAT WE SEE NOW AND IT CREATES AN EFFECT A THREE D. EFFECT 
EACH SIDE HAS AN ARCHITECTURAL BUILDING ON IT 
NOW THEY LOOK AND CERTAINLY THE PLACE NAMES UNDERNEATH LOOK TO BE MORE 
AUSTRO HUNGARIAN SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
MIDDLE EUROPEAN DESIGN OF ARCHITECTURE AND THE LETTERING UNDERNEATH 
QUITE POPULAR TODAY THERE'S QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WHO COLLECT IT 
WHEN IT COMES TO PUTTING A PRICE ON THIS I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU A KING'S RANSOM 
OR SEND YOU ON AN EXOTIC HOLIDAY AT ALL 
HOWEVER THEY'RE QUITE COLLECTIBLE 
AND I'D FEEL DISAPPOINTED IF YOU DIDN'T GET BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY AND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
NOW AS REGARDS TO RESERVE WOULD YOU BE HAPPY WITH A RESERVE OF ONE HUNDRED MM 
HOW DOES THAT GRAB YOU THAT'S FINE YEAH YOU SEEMED VERY RELAXED 
WELL I'M HERE BECAUSE I'VE DECIDED TO GET RID OF IT 
THANK YOU FOR COMING WILL WE SEE YOU AT THE AUCTION YES 
SHEILA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING IN 
YOU KNOW I LOVE WOOD I LOVE TREEN THIS IS A GORGEOUS BIT OF TREEN 
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS FOR A FEW MINUTES AND I'M A BIT FOXED 
AND I HOPE YOU ARE AS WELL BECAUSE I CAN'T QUITE WORK IT OUT 
I KNOW I KNOW IT'S BEEN WELL USED 
YES IT'S A QUALITY ITEM IT'S MADE OF CUBAN MAHOGANY AND IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING FROM A JACQUARD LOOM 
YOU SORT OF SEPARATE SOMETHING BUT I KNOW IT'S NOT THAT BECAUSE IT'S TOO REFINED 
IT COULD BE A PAGE TURNER IF THERE WAS ONLY ONE PRONG YES 
BUT I'M NOT SURE IT'S A SEPARATOR OF SOME SORT WHAT IS IT 
IT USED TO BE USED IN THE OLD LEATHER LEDGERS 
WHEN YOU GET TO THE END 
WHEN YOU HAVE A BOOK THAT'S THAT THICK A TO Z. AND VERY THICK 
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT NOW IT'S DIFFICULT 
YOUR HAND WOULD JUST FALL OFF THE END ONCE YOU GOT TO THE END OF THE LINE SO YOU NEED TO SUPPORT IT 
SO THAT GOES IN THE PAGES LIKE SO AND THEN YOU REST YOUR HAND 
YES THIS TAKES THE WEIGHT 
THERE YOU GO IT'S LOGICAL ISN'T IT 
O. K. SO HOW DID YOU COME BY THIS 
WELL MY HUSBAND'S HAD IT FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER 
WE'D BEEN MARRIED FIFTY TWO AND A HALF YEARS WHEN HE DIED RECENTLY 
HE'S JUST HAD IT HANGING UP ON THE WALL 
WELL IT'S VICTORIAN CIRCA ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE 
YES THAT TIES IN 
WAS HE A CLERK AT ALL 
MY HUSBAND WAS AN ACCOUNTANT AH 
THERE YOU GO HIS FATHER WHO WAS IN THE CHOIR AT SAINT GEORGE'S WAS A BOOK KEEPER 
BETWEEN SINGING THEY HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER JOB ALL LAY CLERKS 
YEAH IN CHAPELS AND COLLEGES SAINT GEORGE'S HERE YOU MEAN HE WAS SINGING IN SAINT GEORGE'S 
YES HE WAS BORN HERE MY HUSBAND HE WAS BORN IN THE CASTLE HE WAS BORN IN WINDSOR CASTLE 
HE WAS BORN IN THE ARCHWAY WHERE YOU GO IN YOU GO IN TO THE HENRY THE EIGHTH GATE 
HE COULD ALMOST CLAIM TO HAVE BLUE BLOOD HE COULD BE ROYALTY 
THAT WOULD BE GOOD 
AS A VALUE IT'S A CURIO AS I'VE NOT SEEN ONE BEFORE IT'S VERY HARD TO PUT A PRICE ON IT 
BUT I THINK BECAUSE OF ITS SOCIAL HISTORY BECAUSE IT'S A SORT OF GENTLEMEN'S TOY 
I THINK WE CAN PUT THIS INTO AUCTION AND HOPEFULLY GET AROUND SIXTY TO NINETY 
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY WITH THAT 
YES I WOULD YEAH YES WE'LL LET THE AUCTIONEER USE HIS DISCRETION 
WE'LL PUT A RESERVE OF FIFTY IN THERE YES THANK YOU YEAH SHALL WE FLOG IT YES PLEASE 
HELLO HARRY WHAT A NICE BOWL YOU'VE GOT 
HOW DID YOU COME TO OWN SUCH A NICE BIT OF GLASSWARE 
MY MOTHER WAS CLEARING OUT CLUTTER ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO 
AND HANDED IT ON TO ME 
SHE GOT IT FROM HER MOTHER HER MOTHER IN TURN GOT IT FROM HER SISTER MY GREAT AUNT 
GOING BACK MANY YEARS TO WHEN I WAS A CHILD I HAVE A RECOLLECTION 
OF THIS BEING ON MY GREAT AUNT DORIS'S KITCHEN TABLE WITH WINDFALL APPLES IN IT 
WOW WHAT A GREAT FAMILY HISTORY 
WHERE DO YOU THINK IT CAME ORIGINALLY HOW DID IT COME INTO THE FAMILY 
MY DEAR GREAT AUNT AND MY GRANDMOTHER LIVED IN THE PEMBROKESHIRE VILLAGE OF NEWPORT 
O. K. I RATHER SUSPECT THAT THIS WAS BOUGHT 
AT THE THEN REGULAR AUCTIONS AT NEWPORT MEMORIAL HALL 
THAT'S INTERESTING IT STILL DOESN'T TELL US HOW IT'S GOT FROM WHERE IT WAS MANUFACTURED OVER TO HERE 
THIS IS A PIECE OF AUSTRIAN GLASS 
IT DATES A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THAN YOUR FAMILY HISTORY GOES BACK I WOULD DATE THIS TO ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED 
SLAP BANG IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ART NOUVEAU PERIOD 
STYLISTICALLY IT LOOKS LIKE A PIECE OF LOETZ GLASS 
WHICH WAS ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT FACTORIES IN THE REGION OF THAT ERA 
BUT OF COURSE I'VE HAD A LOOK UNDERNEATH AND AS IS ALWAYS THE WAY THERE'S NO SIGNATURE IS THERE 
NO FACTORY MARK NO SIGNATURE 
SO WHAT WE CAN SAY IS IT'S AUSTRIAN IT'S ART NOUVEAU CIRCA NINETEEN HUNDRED IN THE STYLE OF LOETZ 
LOETZ IS A VERY COLLECTIBLE FACTORY OF THIS IRIDESCENT GLASS BEAUTIFUL COLOURS 
WHAT REALLY INTRIGUES ME IS THESE LOVELY LITTLE FLOWER HEADS PASTED ONTO THE SIDE 
ABSOLUTELY AS FAR AS I CAN SEE UNCHIPPED AS WELL 
YEAH NO DAMAGE WHICH IS AMAZING CONSIDERING IT'S BEEN USED IN YOUR FAMILY FOR SIXTY YEARS 
HAD APPLES GALORE STUFFED IN IT 
A NICE THING WHY DO YOU WANT TO SELL IT NOW AFTER ALL THAT FAMILY HISTORY 
I DO LOVE IT I LOVE THE SHAPE I LOVE THE COLOUR 
BUT IT DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TOWARDS DECORATION IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND SIX 
AND IT'S SUCH A WASTE TO KEEP IT IN A BOX 
LET'S PUT IT INTO THE AUCTION BUT LET'S FIND SOME COLLECTORS WHO WILL DISPLAY IT AND APPRECIATE IT 
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHAT YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE WORTH I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT'S WORTH 
EIGHTY MAYBE ONE HUNDRED MAYBE MORE I DON'T KNOW 
YOU'RE CERTAINLY NOT FAR OFF THE MARK ONE WOULD THINK IT OUGHT TO MAKE CLOSER TO A COUPLE OF HUNDRED POUNDS 
O. K. 
I THINK A SENSIBLE AUCTION ESTIMATE SHOULD BE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED RIGHT 
AND MAYBE PITCH THE RESERVE SLIGHTLY UNDER THE LOWER FIGURE 
SO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE AS A FIRM RESERVE O. K. 
I THINK IT WILL ATTRACT BUYERS IN 
AND I THINK ONCE THEY'RE THERE AND THEY SEE THE BEAUTY AND THE QUALITY 
PARTICULARLY THESE FLOWER HEADS WHICH ARE REMINISCENT 
OF A LOT OF THE TOP DESIGNERS AT THE LOETZ FACTORY THEY'LL LOVE IT TOO 
AND I THINK THEIR BIDS WILL FOLLOW ACCORDINGLY AND HOPEFULLY GET THE TOP END FOR YOU 
I SHOULD BE VERY VERY INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
SOME OF THE COLOURFUL ITEMS GOING IN TODAY'S AUCTION HAVE BEEN GIVEN A NEW LEASE OF LIFE 
THERE'S JOHN'S JARDINIERE WHICH WAS RESCUED FROM THE LOFT AND THE RUBY DECANTER

WHICH YOU DON'T LIKE 
WELL DONE HARRY THANKS FOR COMING IN 
POLO IS ONE OF THE OLDEST AND FASTEST TEAM GAMES IN THE WORLD 
THE FIRST RECORDED GAME WAS PLAYED IN PERSIA AROUND 
AND WAS PROBABLY A TRAINING EXERCISE FOR THE PERSIAN CAVALRY AS WELL AS A SPORT 
AS THE CAVALRY WERE MADE UP ALMOST ENTIRELY OF NOBLES 
IT EARNED THE GAME THE TITLE THE SPORT OF KINGS 
THE FIRST POLO CLUB WAS OPENED IN INDIA AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT 
THERE'S STILL A VERSION OF POLO THAT'S PLAYED ON ELEPHANTS INSTEAD OF PONIES 
IN THE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED POLO WAS ADOPTED BY THE ENGLISH TEA PLANTERS THERE 
AND BROUGHT BACK TO BRITAIN 
I TELL YOU WHAT I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS THIS IS SO EXCITING FOR ME 
IT'S POSSIBLY THE MOST EXCITING THING I'VE EVER DONE ON THE SHOW 
I'M GONNA GET THE OPPORTUNITY NOT ONLY TO LEARN THE RULES 
AND HOW TO PLAY THE GAME AND ALSO LEARN ABOUT THE HISTORY OF POLO 
BUT GET ON A POLO PONY AND TRY IT FOR MYSELF 
NOW HOW EXCITING IS THAT 
I'M SPENDING THE DAY HERE AT THE PRESTIGIOUS ROYAL COUNTY OF BERKSHIRE POLO CLUB 
WHERE PRINCE CHARLES HIMSELF IS A MEMBER 
WELL THERE'S ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO NOW THAT'S GET THE KIT ON 
I GUESS I'D BETTER GO AND MEET MY INSTRUCTOR MARK 
HERE HE IS 
HI MARK HELLO PAUL THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME OUT TO TALK TO US TODAY AND GIVING ME A LESSON 
RIGHT I'M PETRIFIED 
I HAVE RIDDEN A HORSE BEFORE SO THAT'S THE O. K. BIT 
BUT HITTING A BALL FROM A HORSE IS GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME 
TALK ME THROUGH THE TECHNIQUE 
O. K. WE'RE GONNA USE THE WOODEN HORSE TO START YOU OFF YES 
SO AT LEAST THE HORSE IS KEEPING STILL WHEN YOU'RE PRACTISING YOUR SWING TECHNIQUE 
WE START OFF JUST SITTING IN THE SADDLE AS NORMAL WHEN YOU'RE RIDING AROUND BUT THE BIG CHANGE FOR YOU 
AS A RIDER WILL BE THAT YOU HOLD YOUR REINS IN YOUR LEFT HAND ONE HANDED 
TO ENABLE YOU TO SWING THE MALLET 
YOU HIT IT WITH THE FRONT OF THE MALLET HERE 
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK WE HIT LIKE THIS THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE 
SO WE ACTUALLY HIT IT WITH THIS PART OF THE MALLET 
THAT WAY TO GO FORWARDS 
AND USE THE BACK OF THE MALLET TO GO BACKWARDS 
O. K. WHAT'S THE BALL MADE OF 
NOWADAYS THE BALL IS MADE OF A VERY VERY HARD PLASTIC ALMOST LIKE AN ICE HOCKEY PUCK IT'S ROCK HARD 
OH IT IS ISN'T IT 
I CAN MAKE THAT THING TRAVEL AT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED M. P. H. WHEN I HIT IT REALLY HARD 
MOST GOOD PROFESSIONAL PLAYERS 
THAT'S GONNA HURT IT IS IF YOU GET IN THE WAY 
ORIGINALLY IT WAS MADE FROM THE PULU ROOT FROM THE PULU TREE 
A VERY HARD ROOT WHERE THE MODERN NAME POLO COMES FROM AH WHERE THE NAME COMES FROM 
GO ON THEN MARK GIVE IT A GOOD OLD SWING AND LET'S SEE IT PUT INTO PRACTICE 
YOU CAN SEE I'VE GOT THIS SWEET SORT OF PENDULUM TYPE MOVEMENT 
THE KIND OF THING YOU SEE A GOLFER PLAY 
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY IT OFF THE SIDE OF A HORSE WHICH WE RIDE AT FORTY M. P. H. 
THAT'S THE DIFFICULT BIT THAT IS THE TRICKY BIT YEAH 
I START BY PUTTING ANGLES INTO THE SHOTS 
I'M TWISTING MY BODY THROUGH NINETY DEGREES 
I'M BENDING MY ELBOW AND COCKING MY WRIST 
I JUST RELEASE ALL THAT STORED UP POWER 
ONTO THE BALL AND HIT THROUGH HERE LIKE SO 
I DON'T TRY AND HOLD ONTO THE MALLET 
I JUST RELEASE RELAX AND LET IT SWING 
BECAUSE IF I'VE MISSED THE BALL I'LL NEED TO SWING AGAIN 
O. K. YOU DO THAT BOTH FORWARDS BOTH SIDES OF THE PONY 
LIKE SO 
THEN YOU JUST GIVE THIS BALL A LITTLE TAP 
I'LL JUST DEMONSTRATE THE SHOT 
O. K. 
O. K. NOW IT'S MY TURN 
RIGHT 
IT'S A LOT EASIER THAN BEING ON THE REAL THING THAT'S FOR SURE 
RIGHT O. K. HEELS DOWN 
HEELS DOWN THERE YOU GO CAN YOU DO THAT YOURSELF 
ON THE OUTSIDE GOOD THERE YOU GO 
LET'S JUST GET THAT SEATED PROPERLY IN YOUR HAND 
YOU'VE GOT A NICE LOOSE GRIP ACTUALLY THAT'S EXCELLENT 
RIGHT O. K. THEN IT'S TIME TO HIT THE BALL 
TIME TO HIT THE BALL OH DEAR I'LL JUST STEP BACK A LITTLE 
OH A BEAUTY 
WHAT A LOVELY FEELING 
JAMMY 
ONCE YOU'VE HIT IT ONCE ALL YOU WANT TO DO IS HIT IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN 
THAT'S WHY POLO IS SO ADDICTIVE AND PEOPLE LOVE IT SO MUCH 
SO MUCH FOR THE PRACTISING TIME FOR THE REAL THING 
WHAT'S HER NAME THIS IS PEANUT 
THIS IS ONE OF MY LITTLE HORSES 
ONE TWO THREE AND YOU'RE ON 
RIGHT O. K. WELL THE SCARY BIT IS NOW TRYING TO HIT THE BALL ISN'T IT 
LET'S COME OUT ONTO THE POLO PITCH AND SEE IF YOU CAN REMEMBER WHAT YOU LEARNT 
I BET I WON'T HIT THE BALL 
OH 
COME ON PAUL 
I MISSED IT 
A GAME CONSISTS OF FOUR PERIODS OF PLAY AND THEY'RE CALLED CHUKKAS 
EACH ARE SEVEN MINUTES LONG AND THE GAME IS SO FAST AND FURIOUS 
THAT THE PLAYERS USE A FRESH PONY FOR EVERY CHUKKA 
THERE ARE FOUR PLAYERS TO A TEAM AND THE OBJECT IS TO SCORE THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF GOALS 
HOW CAN YOU HIT A BALL THAT HARD 
THAT WAS A SLOG 
I'VE GOT TO TRY AND SCORE A GOAL 
THAT'S IT PAUL JUST RELAX INTO IT AND SWING RIGHT BACK 
THAT'S IT 
IT'S NOT QUITE THERE QUICKLY 
QUICKLY QUICKLY 
THAT'S IT WELL DONE 
OH BRILLIANT ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
THANK YOU SO MUCH MARK 
ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS POLO SCHOOL'S DEFINITELY WORTH A VISIT 
IN FACT I'M GONNA REPHRASE THAT IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH SEVERAL VISITS 
AND YOU MAY EVEN GET TO RIDE ON GOOD OLD PEANUT HERE WHAT A DAY OUT 
THANK YOU MY PLEASURE 
THERE'S EVEN ONE WITH WINDSOR ON IT 
AND BACK AT THE VALUATION DAY LET'S SEE WHAT ADAM HAS FOUND 
SHEILA THIS IS SOMETHING I REALLY LIKE MYSELF 
I LOVE THE ART NOUVEAU MOVEMENT AND THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE 
WHERE DID YOU GET IT FROM IT WAS MY MOTHER'S AND I BELIEVE HER PARENTS' AS WELL BEFORE THAT 
I'VE HAD IT ALL THIS TIME AND I'VE USED IT AS A LITTLE VASE 
YOU'VE USED IT NICELY AS A VASE 
IT'S NICE TO HAVE THESE THINGS USED AS WELL 
IT'S MADE REALLY FOR ORNAMENT 
IT'S MADE BY THE HUNGARIAN FACTORY CALLED ZSOLNAY 
SOME PEOPLE SAY ZOLNAY BUT I THINK IT'S Z. S. O. L. N. A Y. 
ESTABLISHED IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTIES 
THEY STARTED INITIALLY MAKING QUITE TRADITIONAL ITEMS 
AT THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN 
THEY WENT TO MAKING ART NOUVEAU ITEMS 
THEY'RE WELL KNOWN FOR THESE IRIDESCENT GLAZES THAT WE SEE ON THE FRONT AND THE RED PARTICULARLY 
I JUST LOVE THIS FLOWING DRESS AROUND THE CENTRAL VASE 
I THINK SHE'S ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL 
IT DATES FROM THE TURN OF THE CENTURY AROUND NINETEEN HUNDRED RIGHT 
AND IT ORIGINATES FROM HUNGARY 
VERY POPULAR NOWADAYS 
I SEE THERE'S A FEW LITTLE BITS OF DAMAGE 
I'M SURE YOU'VE NOT DONE THOSE NO 
YOU CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN THEY WERE DONE CAN'T REMEMBER 
THERE'S A FEW LITTLE MARKS ALONG HERE 
AND A BIT OF DAMAGE ON HER ARM YES I KNEW THAT WAS THERE 
WE'LL HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS WITH THE VALUE 
WHEN WE WERE TALKING BEFORE YOU DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VALUABLE DID YOU NO I DIDN'T 
I'M GONNA DISAGREE REALLY 
SOME OF THE ZSOLNAY PIECES CAN FETCH THOUSANDS NOW 
I DON'T THINK WE'RE IN THAT LEAGUE 
NO BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY MORE THAN TWENTY TYPE OF THING 
I WOULD SUGGEST AN ESTIMATE OF ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THAT'S A SURPRISE 
THAT'S A NICE SURPRISE WE'LL PUT A RESERVE OF EIGHTY SHALL WE 
I THINK IF IT DOESN'T MAKE EIGHTY IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH HANGING ONTO 
JUST BEING A BIT CAUTIOUS BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGE 
I THINK FINGERS CROSSED WE COULD BE IN FOR A LITTLE SURPRISE THERE 
SHALL WE SHOW EVERYONE AT HOME WHAT THE MARKS ARE LIKE SO THEY CAN SPOT IT THEMSELVES 
OR SHOULD WE LEAVE IT FLAT ON THE TABLE YOU CAN SHOW THEM THE MARKS 
THERE'S THE ZSOLNAY MARK AND THESE ARE THE USUAL SHAPE AND PATTERN NUMBERS 
AND A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE ART NOUVEAU MOVEMENT 
LET'S HOPE IT GOES AND MAKES A FORTUNE 
I WON'T BE EMBARRASSED IF IT MAKES A LOT MORE 
OH GOOD 
MORNING KEITH MORNING 
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IN THIS WONDERFUL CHINESE POT 
TELL ME HOW DID YOU COME TO OWN IT 
IT BELONGED TO MY LATE MOTHER IN LAW AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IT ON DISPLAY 
SHE WAS QUITE PROUD OF IT 
SO IT'S A FAMILY PIECE IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME 
AS LONG AS YOU CAN REMEMBER 
YES OVER THIRTY YEARS REALLY AS LONG AS THAT 
AS FAR AS YOU KNOW DID YOUR FAMILY EVER TRAVEL TO CHINA 
OR WAS THERE ANY NAVAL HISTORY TO IT 
WELL HER HUSBAND WAS IN THE NAVY 
HE WAS SO HE TRAVELLED EXTENSIVELY WHICH COULD EXPLAIN HOW THIS CAME 
AS I SAID IT'S CHINESE 
IT'S OBVIOUSLY WHAT WE CALL A PIECE OF BLUE AND WHITE 
I SUSPECT IT HAD A LID AT SOME POINT AS MOST GINGER JARS TENDED TO 
UNDERNEATH THERE'S THIS TELL TALE RIM WHERE IT WOULD HAVE STOOD ON A STAND ORIGINALLY AS WELL 
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW OLD IT MIGHT BE NO 
NONE AT ALL WELL IT'S PRETTY OLD 
AN AWFUL LOT OF THESE AND MOST THAT WE SEE ARE WHAT WE CALL EXPORT PIECES 
MADE AT THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
THEY WERE MASS PRODUCED AND SHIPPED OVERSEAS TO EUROPE BUT THIS IS EARLIER THAN THAT 
THIS IS PROBABLY AROUND ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THAT SORT OF ERA 
ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTIES 
WE CAN TELL THAT BY THE PARTICULAR COLOURING OF THE BLUE 
THE HUES OF THE BLUE AND THE GLAZE 
THIS SORT OF TO PEARLESCENT GLAZE TO IT WHICH GIVES AN INDICATION OF THAT EARLY AGE 
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT SORT OF VALUE IT MIGHT HAVE 
WELL SHE DID TELL US SOMEONE SAW IT MANY YEARS AGO AND OFFERED FIFTY FIFTY 
O. K. THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ON THE MEAN SIDE 
I THINK IT'S WORTH A BIT MORE THAN THAT 
WE HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS WHEN WE VALUE IT BECAUSE THE LID'S MISSING AND THE STAND'S NOT THERE 
AND THERE'S A VERY SLIGHT HAIRLINE CRACK JUST ALONG THE TOP 
VALUE WISE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED 
THAT SORT OF REGION MAYBE A LITTLE MORE ON A GOOD DAY 
IF IT'S ILLUSTRATED AND NOTIFIED TO THE RIGHT BUYERS PROPERLY 
WE NEED TO PUT A FIRM RESERVE ON IT 
SOMETHING TO SAFETY GUARD IT FROM BEING SOLD TOO CHEAP IF THE RIGHT BUYERS AREN'T THERE ON THE DAY 
YOU WERE OFFERED FIFTY FOR IT 
I THINK IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO PUT ONE HUNDRED FIRM RESERVE 
IF IT DOESN'T MAKE THAT TAKE IT HOME AND TRY AND SELL IT ANOTHER DAY 
BUT IT SHOULD BE A GOOD STARTING PRICE AND SOMETHING NOT TO LET IT GO LESS THAN 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT YES O. K. THANK YOU KEITH 
LYNN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING TODAY AND BRINGING ALONG THIS GREAT COLLECTION 
TELL ME THEY DON'T BELONG TO YOU DO THEY 
NO THEY'RE AN ELDERLY NEIGHBOUR'S WHO'S NOT WELL AT THE MOMENT 
SO I BROUGHT THEM ALONG FOR HIM 
RIGHT AND HE'S GIVEN YOU PERMISSION TO THINK ABOUT SELLING THEM 
YEAH HE WAS GOING TO SELL THEM ANYWAY 
DO YOU KNOW MUCH OF THE STORY BEHIND HOW HE COLLECTED THESE 
ALL I KNOW IS THAT HE'S BEEN COLLECTING FOR ABOUT THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS 
HOW HE GOT STARTED I DON'T REALLY KNOW 
HOW OLD IS HE NOW SEVENTY 
WHAT'S HIS NAME PHILIP PHILIP 
AND DO YOU LOOK AFTER HIM WHEN HE'S NOT VERY WELL YEAH THAT'S VERY GOOD OF YOU VERY NOBLE VERY NICE 
THESE ARE ALL STICKPINS STOCKPINS FOR ONE'S STOCK TIE 
SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN CONVERTED FROM A HATPIN A LADY'S HATPIN 
TO MAKE IT INTO A TIE OR A STOCKPIN 
HE'S GOT A WIDE COLLECTION HERE 
HOW MANY DO YOU RECKON ARE HERE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THREE HAVE YOU COUNTED THEM 
I HAVEN'T BUT HE HAS I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT 
DID HE SAY TO YOU OH THAT ONE'S A REALLY NICE ONE HE DIDN'T 
BUT MY FAVOURITE IS THE DOG ONE 
YEAH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE DOG ONE HAVEN'T WE 
THE DOG ONE IS THE MOST VALUABLE YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT 
THIS ONE HERE IF WE JUST TAKE THIS ONE OUT 
THIS ONE IS ROCK CRYSTAL 
IT'S WHAT WE CALL DOMED WHICH IS CALLED CABOCHON BECAUSE IT'S DOMED 
THE WAY THEY'VE DONE THIS LOVELY DOG PICTURE 
IS THEY HAVE REVERSE CARVED THE BASE IN THE SHAPE OF A DOG WHICH IS REALLY DIFFICULT 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE CARVING IN A MIRROR IMAGE THEN THEY PAINTED IT 
HENCE THEY'VE GOT THE PRETTY DOG 
THESE ARE CALLED REVERSE PAINTED INTAGLIOS 
OR COMMONLY KNOWN AS ESSEX CRYSTALS 
BECAUSE AN ESSEX JEWELLER INVENTED THE PROCESS 
THAT ONE INDIVIDUALLY IS WORTH ABOUT EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
THE OTHER NICE ONE IS THIS ONE HERE 
IT'S CARVED AGATE WITH A LITTLE DIAMOND IN IT CAN YOU SEE THAT 
YEAH THIS IS A CARVED AGATE 
CARVED AS A SHELL 
LOOKING LIKE AN OYSTER SHELL 
THEN THE LITTLE DIAMOND IN THERE MAKES IT LOOK LIKE A BIT OF A GEM 
LIKE A LITTLE SHINING GEM INSIDE THE SHELL 
THAT'S WORTH AROUND FORTY TO SIXTY 
LOTS OF THEM HERE ARE WHAT WE WOULD CALL ALMOST QUITE PEDESTRIAN 
YOU'VE GOT THE LITTER ONE HERE FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS QUITE FUN 
AND ALL OF THESE HORSESHOES AT THE FRONT ARE NOT WORTH A GREAT DEAL 
WHAT WE DO IS WE GET THIS COLLECTION OF TWO HUNDRED THIRTY 
THREE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THREE DIVIDE THEM INTO ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN OR WHATEVER IT'S GOING TO BE 
MAYBE ONE WILL BE MORE THAN THE OTHER 
BUT EACH OF THOSE TWO DIFFERENT LOTS 
WE SEPARATE OUT THE GOOD ONES AND DIVIDE THEM UP BETWEEN THE TWO LOTS 
ONE LOT WOULD HAVE THE SHELL AND ONE LOT WOULD HAVE THE ESSEX CRYSTAL 
THE ESTIMATES FOR BOTH OF THOSE LOTS WOULD BE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED 
AS REGARDS TO RESERVES ON EACH OF THOSE LOTS I'D SAY TWO HUNDRED WITH THE AUCTIONEER'S DISCRETION 
THERE'S NO POINT GIVING THEM AWAY 
IS PHILIP GOING TO COME ALONG TO THE AUCTION YEAH 
I'VE ALREADY SPOKEN TO HIM AND HE SHOULD BE UP TO COMING 
AND YOU'LL GIVE HIM A LIFT YEAH 
IT'S VERY GOOD OF YOU TO DO THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU THERE
