WELCOME TO TUESDAY'S WORKING LUNCH 
ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST BANKS 
ASKED FOR ONE BILLION IN EXTRA 
FUNDING THE SHARES HAVE FALLEN 
WHAT DOES THE MOVE MEAN FOR 
INVESTORS AND THE WHOLE BANKING 
SECTOR SECTOR ALSO TOASTING SUCCESS THE BAKERS 
OF KINGSMILL AND OWNERS OF PRIMARK 
BEAT THE CREDIT CRUNCH WITH A NICE 
RISE IN PROFITS 
I AM NICK WOOD COMING UP THE 
GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES A REVIEW OF 
THE WAY BRITAIN'S AIRPORTS ARE RUN 
FOOD PRICES ARE ON THE UP 
THE PRICE OF WHEAT IS GOING THROUGH 
THE ROOF THE PRICE OF FLOUR AND 
BREAD IS ON THE RISE TOO WHAT 
DOES THAT MEAN FOR BUSINESSES IN 
THIS INDUSTRY AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN 
FOR THE CONSUMER L. HAVE COME TO 
ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S OLDEST 
PRODUCERS OF FLOUR TO FIND OUT ON 
THE DAY THE CHANCELLOR MEETS 
MORTGAGE LENDERS WE WILL ALSO HAVE 
ADVICE IF YOU ARE FACING A MORTGAGE 
SQUEEZE SQUEEZE FIRST ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND IS 
ASKING SHAREHOLDERS FOR AN EXTRA 
TWELVE BILLION TO SHORE UP ITS 
FINANCES ALTHOUGH ONE HAS TO SAY 
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SUGGESTION 
THAT THE BANK IS ACTUALLY IN ANY 
TROUBLE IT IS AGOING TO DO THAT 
GET THAT MONEY BY ISSUING NEW 
SHARES IN WHAT IS CALLED A RIGHTS 
ISSUE THAT IS GOING TO HAVE A BIG 
IMPACT ON INVESTORS ITS COMPANY 
AND MIGHT BE THE START OF A FLURRY 
OF BANKS CALLING FOR NEW CASH TO 
SUPPORT THEIR BUSINESSES BEFORE WE 
GET TO THE DETAIL OF THAT DEAL LET 
ME STEP BACK A BIT AND EXPLAIN WHO 
ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND ARE IT IS AL 
MASSIVE COMPANY BIGGER THAN THE 
BRAND ITSELF HERE ARE RBS'S MANY 
FAVOURITE THINGS ROYAL BANK OF 
SCOTLAND OWNS NATWEST BANK IT ALSO 
OWNS KOOTS AND CO IT ALSO OWNS 
ULSTER BANK AND LOMBARD ASSET 
FINANCE BIZARRELY IT OWN ANGEL 
TRAINS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BANK 
WHICH LEASES TRAINS TO COMPANIES 
IT THEN OWNS JAMJAR CARS THAT IS 
AN INTERNET BASED CAR SELLER IT 
OWNS SOMETHING CALLED STREAMLINE 
WHICH ORGANISED CREDIT CARD PAYMENT 
SYSTEMS FOR COMPANIES RELATED 
BUSINESS WORLD PAY WHICH ALSO 
PROCESSES PAYMENTS IT ALSO OWNS 
CHURCHILL INSURANCE DIRECT LINE 
AND WE SHOULD PUT ON A POSH VOICE 
FOR PRIVILEGE INSURANCE DESPITE 
OWNING ALL THOSE THINGS IT SAID 
TODAY IT MAY ACTUALLY HAVE TO SELL 
SOME OF THESE ASSETS IN ORDER TO 
RAISE SOME FOUR BILLION AS A RESULT 
IT IS REVIEWING ITS INSURANCE 
DIVISIONS INCLUDING CHURCH ILL AND 
DIRECT LINE SPECIFICALLY THE BANK 
SAID IT HAS SEEN A SEVERE AND 
INCREASING DETERIORATION IN THE 
CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS THE 
WORSENING ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND 
INCREASED LIKELIHOOD THAT CREDIT 
MARKETS WOULD REMAIN DIFFICULT FOR 
SOMETIME AS A RESULT THE BANK HAS 
ANNOUNCED THIS RIGHTS ISSUE A 
RIGHTS ISSUE IS ALL ABOUT THIS 
PEOPLE DEMANDING RIGHTS ABOUT 
SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT HERE IT IS WHEN A COMPANY 
ISSUES MORE SHARES AND EXISTING 
SHAREHOLDERS HAVE A RIGHT TO BUY 
THEM AT A DISCOUNT UNDER THE TERMS 
OF THIS PARTICULAR RIGHTS ISSUE WE 
HAVE HEARD THIS MORNING ELEVEN NEW 
SHARES WILL BE ISSUED FOR EVERY 
EXISTING EIGHTEEN SHARES 
THAT RIGHTS ISSUE IS VALUING IT AT 
FORTY SIX PER CENT LESS THAN MONDAY'S CLOSING 
PRICE OF THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PENCE QUITE AL 
DISCOUNT THERE THE PROBLEM FOR 
SHAREHOLDERS IF THEY DON'T TAKE UP 
THEIR RIGHTS THE PRICE OF THEIR 
EXISTING SHARES FALL BECAUSE THEY 
NOW OWN A SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF THE 
COMPANY IF THEY DO TAKE UP THEIR 
RIGHT IT MEANS THEY HAVE TO INVEST 
MORE MONEY THESE ARE THEIR OPTIONS 
THE THIRD OPTION IS NOT TO BUY THE 
NEW SHARES BUT THEN THEY HAVE 
ACTUALLY THEY CAN SELL THE RIGHT 
THEMSELVES TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO 
WANT TO BUY THOSE RIGHTS AND THEY 
CAN BUY THOSE SHARES AND BUY THEM 
AT A DISCOUNT TONNES OF STUFF 
GOING ON HERE GAVIN OLDHAM IS 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE SHARE CENTRE 
AND HAS JOINED US TODAY 
IT IS A DIFFICULT DECISION IF YOU 
ARE AN RBS SHAREHOLDER NOW YOU 
HAVE EITHER GOT TO STUMP UP MORE 
MONEY IN AN ATTEMPT TO SAFEGUARD 
YOUR SHARE HOLDINGS OR NOT IN 
WHICH CASE YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE 
VALUE 
IF YOU ARE A LONG TERM VALUE SHAREHOLDER THE BEST THING TO DO 
IS CARRY ON HOLDING THE SHARES AT 
THIS LEVEL AND TO TAKE UP THE 
RIGHTS BUT THE THING IS RBS IS A 
VERY DIFFERENT ANIMAL NOW FROM WHAT 
IT WAS EVEN A YEAR OR TWO AGO L. 
THINK THAT'S A BIG CHANGE YOU YOU WOULD ADVISE PEOPLE THEREFORE 
GENERALLY TO SPEND THE MONEY ON 
BUYING THE SHARES EVEN THOUGH THE 
BANKING SECTOR IS IN ALL SORTS OF 
TROUBLE IT MIGHT BE SEEMED AS GOOD 
MONEY AFTER BAD 
THE ROYAL BANK OF 
SCOTLAND IS TAKING DECISIVE ACTION 
TO SORT OUT ITS BALANCE SHEET AND 
GET IT RIGHT UNFORTUNATELY A LARGE 
PART OF THAT SORTING OUT IS 
ACTUALLY MAKING GOOD THE VERY 
EXPENSIVE TAKEOVER IT MADE LAST 
YEAR OF A. B. N. AMRO IN A SENSE THE 
WHOLE STORY OF RBS IS LIKE A TALE 
OF TWO TAKEOVERS THE ORIGINAL ONE 
WITH NATWEST WAS EXTREMELY GOOD 
NEWS FOR IT AND EVERYTHING WENT 
VERY WELL FOLLOWING THAT BUT WITH 
A. B. N. AMRO THEY WENT INTO THAT 
TAKEOVER AT A VERY EXPENSIVE PRICE 
AND EXACTLY THE WRONG TIME IN TERMS 
OF 
THE MARKET L. SUSPECT A LOT OF THE WRITE DOWNS IT IS TAKING NOW 
ARE AGAINST A. N. B. AMRO BUSINESS DO DO YOU THINK THAT THE REST OF THE 
BANKS THE TALK TODAY IS WE HAVE 
KNOWN ABOUT RBS WE KNEW THEY WERE 
GOING TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE ARE 
GOING TO DO IT 
YES THAT IS ONE OF 
THE ADVANTAGES FOR RBS OF GOING SO 
EARLY IN THE PROCESS BECAUSE IT IS 
FRESH NEWS AND BASICALLY THEY ARE 
GOING FOR PEOPLE'S MONEY FIRST OFF 
IT IS A BIG RIGHTS ISSUE THIS TWELVE 
BILLION A HUGE AMOUNT 
IT MUST BE 
AMONGST THE BIGGEST 
ON TOP OF THAT 
AS YOU MENTIONED THERE IS TALK OF 
SELLING OFF THE INSURANCE SUB SID 
RHYS ALSO IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES 
TALKING ABOUT SELLING OFF THE ANGEL 
TRAINS SUBSIDIARY WHICH IS ANOTHER 
THREE BILLION THEY ARE RAISING A HUGE 
AMOUNT HERE IT WILL DWARF ANYTHING 
ELSE THAT THE BANKING SECTOR CAN DO 
FOR A WHILE 
WE SAID THERE IS NO NO 
SUGGESTION THE BANK IS UNSTABLE SO 
WHY DO THEY NEED SO MUCH CASH THE THE TRUTH IS IT IS TO PUT RIGHT A LOT 
OF THE BAD TIMING OF THE PURCHASE 
OF A. B. N. AMRO AT THE EXPENSIVE PRICE 
THEY DID L. SUSPECT MORE OF THE 
MONEY IS GOING TO SORTING OUT THE 
OLD PROBLEMS THAN ACTUALLY 
INVESTING FOR THE NEW IN THE 
COURSE OF IT THEY WILL END UP WITH 
A STRONGER BALANCE SHEET THEIR 
CAPITAL RATIO WILL INCREASE ALMOST 
FOUR POINT FIVE PER CENT TO SEVEN PER CENT 
WE SHOULD SAY PEOPLE 
SHOULD MAKE THEIR OWN MINDS UP AND 
TAKE ADVICE WHAT THEY DO DEPENDS 
ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES 
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS TAKE ADVICE GO 
TO SOMEWHERE WHICH PROVIDES ADVICE 
TAKE CARE OF YOUR OWN CIRCUMSTANCES 
AND MAKE SURE YOU GET THE RIGHT 
ADVICE FOR YOU 
AGAINST THAT BACKGROUND WITH THE 
BANKS THE CHANCELLOR WILL MEET SOME 
OF THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST MORTGAGE 
LENDERS THIS AFTERNOON TO URGE THEM 
TO DO MORE TO HELP HOME OWNERS WHO 
ARE STRUGGLING AS A RESULT OF THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH MR. DARLING BELIEVES 
THE BANKS SHOULD PASS ON THE 
BENEFITS OF THE FIFTY BILLION AID 
PACKAGE PROVIDED BY THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND FRANCES WALKER FROM THE 
CONSUMER CREDIT COUNSELLING SERVICE 
IS HERE ALSO ON THE AGENDA TODAY 
IS THE LENDERS SHOULD DO MORE TO 
AVERT POSSIBLE REPOSSESSIONS AND 
YOU HAVE SET UP A COUNSELLING 
SERVICE FOR PEOPLE WHICH SUGGESTS 
THERE IS A PROBLEM 
WE THINK THERE 
IS A PROBLEM THERE'S A LOT OF 
ISSUES A COMBINATION OF ISSUES 
YOU HAVE THINGS LIKE THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH CREDIT IS MORE EXPENSIVE 
PEOPLE HAVE BORROWED A LOT OF MONEY 
AND THERE'S ALSO BILLS GETTING 
HIGHER SO PEOPLE ARE REALLY 
FINDING THAT THEY ARE HAVING 
DIFFICULTY MAKING THEIR MORTGAGE 
PAYMENTS 
I WANT TO PUT THIS IN PAYMENTS PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THE PRESS AND 
MEDIA ARE QUICK TO BUILD THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH UP AS A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR 
ORDINARY HOUSEHOLDERS WHEN WE LAST 
HAD THE HOUSING CRIESS INTEREST 
RATES WERE FIFTEEN PER CENT THIS ISN'T THE SAME 
IS IT 
WELL WE HAVE QUITE LOW 
INTEREST RATES BUT WE ALSO HAVE 
MUCH MUCH HIGHER MORTGAGES WE 
ALSO HAVE RECORD LEVELS OF LOW 
SAVINGS HALF THE POPULATION 
HAVEN'T GOT ANY SAVINGS FOR THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH TO DEAL WITH THINGS 
AND LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE COMING OFF 
FIXED RATE MORTGAGES SO THEY 
ACTUALLY ARE PAYING FAR MORE FOR 
THEIR MORTGAGE OUT OF THEIR 
DISPOSABLE INCOME A GREATER 
PROPORTION OF THEIR TAKE HOME PAY 
IS GOING ON THE MORTGAGE THAN IN 
THE NINETIES 
YOU HAVE BEEN LOBBYING 
THE MORTGAGE COMPANIES IN ADVANCE 
OF THIS MEETING AND YOU SAY THEY 
COULD DO MORE TO HELP PEOPLE WHEN 
PROBLEMS START 
PART OF THE PROBLEM 
IS WHEN PEOPLE GET INTO 
DIFFICULTIES THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE 
TO TURN TO HELP THERE ARE A LOT OF 
PEOPLE OUT THERE PREYING ON THE 
VULNERABLE WE WOULD LIKE MORTGAGE 
LENDERS TO RECOGNISE WHEN PEOPLE 
ARE IN DIFFICULTIES WHICH IS EASY 
TO DO AND THEN REFER THEM TO A 
THIRD PARTY A CHARITY SUCH AS OURS 
SO WE CAN HELP THEM WE ACTUALLY 
HAVE A PILOT GOING WITH ONE LENDER 
AT THE MOMENT G. E. MONEY HOME 
LENDING AND WE THINK WE ARE GOING 
TO LEARN A LOT OF USEFUL STUFF OUT 
OF THAT 
TALKING TO YOUR MORTGAGE 
LENDER IS VITAL NOT PUTTING OFF 
THE DAY WE ARE HEARING TALK THIS 
AFTERNOON ON THE AGENDA OF PAYMENT 
HOLIDAYS THIS MEANS YOU CAN TAKE A 
BREAK BUT PAY THE MONEY IN THE END 
IT DEPENDS ON YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES 
WHAT PEOPLE MUST DO IS ENGAGE WITH 
THEIR LENDER THE KEY THING IS TO 
PREPARE AN INCOME AND EXPENDITURE 
PREPARE YOUR BUDGET YOU CAN DO 
THAT WITH A THIRD PARTY WHO CAN 
HELP YOU AND THEN YOU GO TO THE 
MORTGAGE LENDER AND SAY THESE ARE 
MY CIRCUMSTANCES IF IT'S SHORT 
TERM FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU CAN'T PAY 
IT BECAUSE MAYBE YOU ARE ILL OFF 
WORK SICK WIFE IS PREGNANT ON 
MATERNITY LEAVE AND THERE IS AN END 
IN SIGHT THEY MAY GIVE YOU 
PAYMENT HOLIDAY OR THEY MAY 
SUGGEST GOING ON INTEREST ONLY 
MORTGAGE OR THEY MAY SUGGEST LOWER 
MORTGAGE PAYMENTS THERE ARE 
SOLUTIONS DON'T IGNORE THE PROBLEM 
I WAS LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE TODAY 
AND THERE IS TALK ABOUT SOME 
COMPANIES COMING IN OFFERING TO 
TAKE YOUR HOME OFF YOUR MANEDS AND 
THEN RENT IT BACK TO YOU L. THINK 
THEY ARE CALLED FLASH SALES SHOULD 
WE CONSIDER THESE 
THEY GO UNDER A 
WHOLE LOT OF NAMES LIKE FLASH SALES 
OR SALE AND LEASE BACK IT IS AN 
UNREGULATED MARKET BEWARE AND 
DON'T GO FOR THEM AT ALL THERE'S 
ALL SORTS OF WARNINGS ALL OVER THE 
PLACE ABOUT THEM L. KNOW THE 
GOVERNMENT IT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE 
THINGS THEY ARE SUGGESTING TO 
MORTGAGE LENDERS TODAY THAT 
MORTGAGE LENDERS SHOULD GO INTO 
THIS SCHEME BUT WHETHER MORTGAGE 
LENDERS DO IT OR NOT I DON'T THINK 
SO AT THE MOMENT AVOID THOSE 
SCHEMES 
ZPLF WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING SCHEMES THE ADDRESS FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK AT 
SPEAK EARLY TO YOUR MORTGAGE 
COMPANY AND BEWARE 
WE HAVE HAD MANY E. MAILS OVER THE 
LAST FEW DAYS ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH TO ISA DELAYS 
THEY ARE VERY MUCH A TALKING POINT 
AFTER WE FEATURED THEM ON THE 
PROGRAMME A NUMBER OF VIEWERS HAVE 
WRITTEN IN 
ON TO THE MARKETS NOW AND 
ASSOCIATED BRITISH FOODS THEY MAKE 
KINGSMILL RYVITA AND OTHER STUFF 
REPORTED A RIDES IN PROFITS DESPITE 
THE CONCERN ABOUT RISING RAW 
MATERIAL COSTS PARTICULARLY IN THE 
FOOD AREA APART FROM MAKING ALL 
MANNER OF FOODS THEY ALSO OWN 
PRIMARK THE PROFIT HAUL WAS HELD 
BACK BY A SHARP FALL AT ITS SUGAR 
ARM WHICH SUFFERED CUTS IN THE E. U. 
SUGAR QUOTA PRIMARK REVENUES 
INCREASED TWENTY FIVE PER CENT UP TO EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY NINE MILLION 
AS THE CHAIN CLAIMED TEN PER CENT OF THE 
MARKET BY VOLUME THAT MAKES IT THE 
U. K.'S SECOND LARGEST CLOTHING 
RETAILER IT'S OPENED A STEADY 
STREAM OF NEW STORES IN THE U. K. AND 
IN SPAIN GIVING IT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE SHOPS AND 
FIVE MILLION SQUARE FEET OF SELLING 
SPACE SO FAMOUS FOR ITS FOOD AND 
AMID ST THE RETAIL TROUBLE ITS 
RETAIL ARM ARE DOING NICELY 
HERE IS HOW HOW THOSE SHARES 
COMPARE WITH THE RETAILERS 
D. S. G. LOST SIXTY PER CENT OF ITS VALUE 
DEBENHAMS THE THE SAME SITUATION 
A. B. F. ALTHOUGH IT IS DOWN NOTHING 
LIKE AS BAD AS THOSE OTHER 
COMPANIES THERE LET'S LOOK 
ELSEWHERE L. DON'T THINK THE F. T. S. E. 
ONE HUNDRED WILL HAVE DONE A HUGE AMOUNT 
TODAY BUT THERE ARE SOME OF THE 
WIDELY HELD SHARES LOGICACMG SAID 
IT IS GOING TO MAKE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED 
REDUNDANCIES AS PART OF ITS 
RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMME THE 
MAJORITY OF THE REDUNDANCIES ARE 
EXPECTED TO BE RELATED TO A 
REDUCTION OF AROUND FIFTEEN PER CENT OF SO 
CALLED LOGICA'S NON BILLABLE STAFF 
OIL IS REMAINING STRONG TODAY SOME 
STRENGTH IN RIO TINTO AS WELL THE F. T. S. E. ISN'T DOING MUCH 
WITHIN THE LAST HOUR THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED A REVIEW 
OF THE WAY BRITAIN'S AIRPORTS ARE 
RUN IT COMES ON THE DAY THAT THE 
COMPETITION COMMISSION SAID IT 
MIGHT LOOK AT BREAKING UP THE 
OPERATOR B. A. A. IF YOU ARE OFF ON 
HOLIDAY THIS SUMMER CHANCES ARE 
YOU WILL BE USING THE SERVICES OF 
B. A. A. THEY OWN SEVEN OF THE U. K.'S 
AIRPORTS INCLUDING HEATHROW 
AIRPORT GATWICK AIRPORT AND 
STANSTED AIRPORT IN LONDON 
SOUTHAMPTON AND GLASGOW EDINBURGH 
AND ABERDEEN IN SCOTLAND TODAY 
THE COMPETITION COMMISSION HAVE 
SAID THEY ARE WORRIED THIS HUGE 
OWNERSHIP MEANS B. A. A. MAY NOT BE 
SERVING THE INTERESTS OF EITHER THE 
AIRLINES OR THEIR PASSENGERS THE 
BRITISH AIRPORTS AUTHORITY IS 
ESTABLISHED BY AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT 
MORE THAN FORTY YEARS AGO WHEN THE 
GROUP WAS PRIVATISED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN IT 
WAS STRUCTURED TO INCLUDE ALL THREE 
MAJOR LONDON AIRPORTS THE HOPE WAS 
THIS WOULD HELP THE GROUP TO PLAN 
EXPANSION IN THE SOUTH EAST OF 
ENGLAND MAKING SURE THERE WERE 
ENOUGH RUNWAYS AND UP TO DATE 
TERMINALS B. A. A. WAS BROUGHT BY THE 
SPANISH GROUP PHOTOGRAPHIAL IN 
TWO THOUSAND SIX TODAY THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY 
THROUGH CHARGING AIRLINES LANDING 
FEES AND RETAILERS FOR SHOP SPACE 
IN THE AIRPORT WITH AN ONGOING 
INVESTIGATION BY THE COMPETITION 
COMMISSION B. B. A. MIGHT BE IN FOR A 
CRASH LANDING B. A. A. WHAT HA THE 
GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED 
JUST IN THE LAST HOUR OUR TRANSPORT 
SECRETARY RUTH KELLY HAS ANNOUNCED 
A REVIEW OF THE ECONOMIC 
REGULATIONS OF OUR AIRPORTS THAT 
IS WHAT THE COMPETITION COMMISSION 
CALLED IN THEIR FINDS TODAY 
INADEQUATE AM SURE THEY WILL 
WELCOME THAT ANNOUNCEMENT WE DON'T 
KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN JUST YET IN 
TERMS OF THE REVIEW SOME OF THE 
ASPECTS THE GOVERNMENT HAVE SAID IT 
WANTS CONSIDERED ARE INCENTIVES TO 
IMPROVE PASSENGER EXPERIENCE THEY 
WANT TO ENCOURAGE APPROPRIATE 
INVESTMENT IN CAPACITY AND ALSO TO 
ADDRESS THE WIDER ENVIRONMENTAL 
IMPACT OF AIRPORTS 
LET'S GO OVER TO THE COMPETITION 
COMMISSION WHAT ARE THEY SAYING 
IT'S IN A STATEMENT CALLED THE 
EMERGING THINKING THEY HAVE BEEN 
LOOKING AT THE ISSUE SINCE MARCH 
TWO THOUSAND TEN TODAY IS JUST A PROGRESS 
REPORT IT'S NOTHING FINAL IT'S 
JUST TELLING US WHERE WE ARE SO FAR 
EARLIER I SPOKE TO CHRISTOPHER 
CLARKE FROM THE COMPETITION 
COMMISSION HE SAID THIS EMERGING 
THINKS GOING FURTHER THAN THEY 
USUALLY DO AT THIS STAGE THEY ARE 
USED STRONG LANGUAGE REFERRING TO 
THAT SYSTEM AS INADEQUATE THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS RESPONDED TO THAT 
SOMETHING THEY EXPRESSED CONCERN 
OVER IS B. A. A. ACE APPROACH TO 
PLANNING DEVELOPMENT 
THERE SEEMS TO BE A LACK OF 
RESPONSIVENESS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS 
THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE THE AIRLINES 
AND DIFFERENT AIRLINES HAVE 
DIFFERENT NEEDS NOT EVERY AIRLINE 
HAS THE SAME BUSINESS MODEL OF THE 
LOW COST AIRLINES THEY ARE REALLY 
QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE MORE 
TRADITIONAL THE HISTORIC CARRIERS 
SUCH AS B. A. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT 
EACH OF THOSE AIRLINES GETS THE 
FACILITIES IT WANTS THE OTHER 
FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT YOU AS A 
PASSENGER ARE THINGS LIKE SECURITY 
A. R. YOUR PASSAGE THROUGH THE AIRPORT 
ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE CONCERNED 
ABOUT IS THE APPROACH OF B. A. A. WHICH 
MAY BE HAVING A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON 
THE LEVELS AND QUALITY OF SERVICE 
B. A. A. MUST BE FEELING WORRIED WHAT 
ARE THEY SAYING 
THEY HAVE ADMITTED 
THERE ARE PROBLEMS SPECIALLY IN 
TERMS OF THE LACK OF CAPACITY IN 
THE SOUTH EAST THEY GAVE A 
STATEMENT SAYING FOR 
SO WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS THEY 
KNOW THERE ARE PROBLEMS BUT THEY 
THINK THEY ARE THE PEOPLE TO SORT 
IT OUT THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP 
OWNERSHIP 
SO THE COMMISSION IS OWNERSHIP TALKING ABOUT EMERGING STATEMENT W. 
HE MIGHT DO THIS WITH CONSIDERATION 
WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE WHAT CAN 
THEY DO 
THEIR FINAL CONCLUSION 
ISN'T COMING OUT UNTIL MARCH TWINE 
IN THEIR VIEW IT'S LIMITING 
COMPETITION TWO THOUSAND NINE IF THEY STILL 
HOLD THAT VIEW WHEN THEY COME OUT 
WITH THEIR FINAL CONCLUSIONS THAT 
COULD HAVE SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS 
FOR B. A. A. 
WHAT HAVE THE GOVERNMENT 
SAID IN THE LAST HALF OUR THE THE GOVERNMENT HAVE SAID THEY ARE GOING 
TO REVIEW TRANSPORT AND ECONOMIC 
REGULATIONS OF AIRPORTS WHAT IT 
COULD MEAN FOR US IF MORE 
COMPETITION IS INTRODUCED TO COULD 
MEAN SMALLER PRICES LOWER PRICE 
AND ALSO HOPEFULLY A BETTER SERVICE 
RISING FOOD PRICES ARE GOING TO THE 
TOP OF THE POLITICAL AGENDA AS 
GORDON BROWN HOSTS MEETING OF 
LEADING EXPERTS TO DISCUSS THE 
PROBLEM WHEAT PRICES HAVE ROCKETED 
BY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY PER CENT IN JUST TWELVE MONTHS WE SENT 
ROB TO ONE OF OUR OLDEST FLOUR 
MILLS TO FIND OUT HOW THEY ARE 
COPING THIS IS HOW THEY USED TO 
MAKE FLOUR BACK IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
I AM IN THE MUSEUM SECTION OF THIS 
FLOUR MILL IN CUMBRIA THE COMPANY 
IS ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN YEARS OLD SO THERE ARE 
PLENTY OF OBJECTS ON DISPLAY HERE 
THERE IS PLENTY OF HISTORY TOO FOR 
A COMPANY LIKE THIS HIGH PRICES 
AND FOOD SHORTAGES ARE NOTHING NEW 
WHAT IS NEW IS THAT THE MODERN 
BUSINESS WORLD IS MORE CUT THROAT 
AND MORE COMPETITIVE THAN EVER 
BEFORE SO HOW DOES A COMPANY LIKE 
THIS COPE WITH PRESSURES LIKE THAT 
PERCHED BY THE SEA ON THE FAR WEST 
COAST OF CUMBRIA IT MIGHT SEEM A 
REMOTE LOCATION BUT IT'S AN 
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND THE MILL 
BUYS ITS WHEAT FROM ALL OVER THE 
WORLD IT GETS THROUGH THREE THOUSAND TONNES 
OF THE CEREAL EVERY WEEK IT'S 
HAVING TO PASS ON THE RISING PRICE 
TO ITS CUSTOMERS THIS IS A COMPANY 
WITH ITS FOOT IN EVERY SECTOR OF 
THE MARKET IT SELLS TO BISCUIT AND 
PIE AND SMALL CRAFT SHOPS IT ALSO 
SELLS ITS PRODUCTS IN SUPERMARKET 
TOO WHAT EFFECT DOES THIS HAVE 
DUNCAN MONROE IS THE MANAGING 
DIRECTOR HOW DOES THIS EFFECT YOUR 
BUSINESS 
WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST TWO 
YEARS WHEAT PRICES VERY NEARLY 
TREBLE WE ARE PAYING FOR GOOD 
QUALITY HOME GROWN BREAD WHEAT 
ABOUT NINETY THOUSAND A TONNE NOW THAT SAME 
WHEAT IS COMING INTO THE MILL AT 
PRICES OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND A TONNE IT'S 
MEANS WE HAVE NO IMPACT BUT TO PASS 
THOSE INCREASES ON THE PERCENTAGE 
RISE WE HAVE SEEN ASTROE NOPIC 
COMPARED TO THE PROFIT MARGINS WE 
ARE USED TO IT'S STRAIGHT FORWARD 
WE HAVE NO CHOICE 
PASS ON 
THE INCREASES 
WHAT IS IT LIKE IN 
THE MARKET DO SALES GO DOWN 
NO L. THINK PROBABLY BECAUSE 
CONSUMERS AND OUR CUSTOMERS 
UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF THE 
SITUATION IT'S NOT JUST A CASE OF 
CARS TRYING TO SQUEEZE A LITTLE BIT 
OF EXTRA PROFIT IT'S PURELY A 
REFLECTION OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN 
THE MARKETPLACE AFTER ALL WHEAT IS 
A COMMODITY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN 
THE WHEAT MARKETS HAVE BEEN WELL 
CHRONICLED L. THINK PEOPLE GENERAL 
UPLY UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A GLOBAL 
THING IT'S NOT SPECIFIC US TO 
THEY HAVE INCREASED THE PRICE OF 
ITS PRODUCT FROM FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED PER CENT IT'S 
ALSO RECORDED A RISE IN ITS SIX 
MONTH AMOUNT 
I THINK IT REFLECTS A YEAR AGO WE 
WERE MOVING INTO THIS VERY 
DIFFICULT PERIOD AND THERE IS A 
TIMELAG SO THAT MARGINS A YEAR AGO 
WERE UNHEALTHILY LOW EVEN NOW 
YEAH THE OPERATING PROFITS ARE UP 
BUT WORKING CAPITAL EMPLOYED IN OUR 
BUSINESS BECAUSE OF THE INCREASES 
IS FOUR OR FIVE MILLION HIGHER THAN 
IT WAS AT THE SAME TIME LAST YEAR 
THAT TAKES FINANCING SO NO WE 
ARE WE HAVE OUR SHAREHOLDERS TO 
ANSWER TO AND IN TERMS OF THE 
RETURNS ON THE CAPITAL INVESTED IN 
THIS BUSINESS YOU COULD STILL 
ARGUE WOULD ARGUE THAT THE MARGIN 
BEENS ARE BARELY ACCEPTABLE TO TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT IT'S LIKE 
WHEN YOU GO OUT TO BUY WHEAT IS 
THERE STRONG COMPETITION THERE IS 
LESS OF IT HAVE YOU GOT NEW 
COMPETITORS COMING IN 
THERE ARE NEW COMPETITORS FOR WHEAT 
AND GRAINS MOST NOTICEABLE FOR THE 
BIOFUEL INDUSTRY L. THINK IT'S 
PREDICTED THAT IN THE NEXT TWELVE 
MONTHS THE U. S. WILL USE EIGHTY MILLION 
TONNES OF CORN FOR BIOFUEL 
PRODUCTION 
WHAT ABOUT THE LONG PRODUCTION TERM LOW DO YOU SEE PRICES IN THE 
FUTURE ARE THEY GOING TO 
STAY HIGH 
IF I KNEW THE ANSWER TO THAT 
QUESTION I WOULD BE DOING A 
DIFFERENT JOB L. THINK STHER GOING 
TO REMAIN HIGH CERTAINLY IT'S TOO 
EARLY TO SAY HOW THE HARVEST THIS 
YEAR IS GOING TO LOOK THE SIGNS 
ARE WE ARE GOING TO PRODUCE MORE 
WE ARE GOING TO PRODUCE AN EXTRA 
THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE MILLION TONNES OF WHEAT BUT 
THERE ARE STILL BIG IFS THE TWO 
BIGGEST WHEAT PRODUCERS IN THE 
WORLD ARE CHINA AND INDIA NOT 
COUNTRIES WOULD YOU NORMALLY 
ASSOCIATE WITH THEM THERE ARE SOME 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE CHINESE HARVEST 
IF THEY DROP THIRTY PER CENT THAT IS MILLION 
TONNE OUT OF THE WORLD'S BREAD 
BASKET SO STILL A LOT OF 
UNCERTAINTY SO WE WILL WAIT TO SEE 
THE HARVEST BEFORE WE CAN BE 
CONFIDENTLY PREDICT WHAT WILL 
HAPPEN TO PRICES 
WITH ITS ROOTS IN 
THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION CARS CAN 
AFFORD TO TAKE A LONG TERM VIEW 
BUT FOR SEVEN OF THE LAST EIGHT 
YEARS THE AMOUNT OF WHEAT PRODUCED 
IN THE WORLD HAS BEEN LOWER THAN 
THE AMOUNT OF WHEAT CONSUMED IT 
MEANS RESERVES HAVE ALL BUT 
DISAPPEARED THIS COMPANY LIKE THE 
REST OF THE INDUSTRY IS WAITING TO 
SEE WHAT THIS YEAR'S HARVEST WILL 
BRING 
THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO CELEBRATIONS 
IT'S EARTH DAY HELD EACH YEAR TO 
PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IT 
WAS FIRST STARTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY IT WAS 
BEGAN BY THIS CHAP GAYLORD NELSON 
FROM WISCONSIN BUT IT'S ALSO THE 
TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE JUPITER 
ECOLOGY FUND SO FOR THIS PART OF 
THE PROGRAMME WE ARE GOING TO 
GREEN THERE WE ARE NOW HOWARD 
BOYD IS HEAD OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBLE 
INVESTMENT AT JUPITER WELCOME TO 
THE PROGRAMME L. SHOULD SAY EMMA 
HOWARD BOYD HAPPY BIRTHDAY IS IT 
THE BRT DAY 
THE LAUNCH OF THE FUND 
WAS THE FIRST OF APRIL WE ARE 
CELEBRATING OVER THE MONTH 
WHEN I 
LOOKED AT THE SHARES IN THIS FUND ONE 
WAS SURPRISED L. THOUGHT IT WOULD 
BE ABOUT TREES AND GREEN ISSUES 
THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS THERE 
WERE A COUPLE OF RAILWAY COMPANIES 
AND A PIG FARMER SUDDENLY YOU ARE 
THINKING ABOUT WHOSE ETHICS IS 
INVESTED 
WE PUT A LOT OF INVESTED INFORMATION ON TO OUR WEBSITE THE 
TRANSPORT COMPANIES FIT INTO OUR 
GREEN TRANSPORT SCHEME THAT ABOUT 
GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF CARS INTO BUS 
ON TO TRAINS BUT WE ALSO LOOK 
BEYOND COMPANIES LIKE FIRST GROUP 
AT THOSE SORTS OF COMPANIES THAT 
ARE PROVIDING ENGINE TECHNOLOGIES 
LIKE RICARDO TO GREEN UP TRANSPORT 
FLEETS WE ARE LOOKING AT THE 
BROADER ASPECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL 
SOLUTIONS FROM AN INVESTORS POINT 
VIEW IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS 
AREA THEY SHOULD BE CAREFUL ABOUT 
THE ETHICS YOURS COULD BE 
DIFFERENT TO ONE FROM A DIFFERENT 
PROVIDER BECAUSE OUR FRONT WAS 
LAUNCHED TWENTY YEARS AGO WE DO HAVE A 
BROAD SELECTION OF THINGS FROM 
AREAS LIKE ARMAMENT MANUFACTURE 
OUR FOCUS IS VERY MUCH AROUND OUR 
GREEN SOLUTIONS AND OUR INVESTMENT 
SCREAMS 
MAYBE PEOPLE ARE SCHEMES SCREAMS MAYBE PEOPLE ARE ATTRACTED TO THIS 
BECAUSE THEY FEEL BETTER TO THOSE 
WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE PROFIT IN 
THE SHORT TERM THE FUND HAS NOT 
PERFORMED WELL IT'S PERFORMED 
WORSE THAN IF I CHUCKED IT INTO THE 
AVERAGE STOCK MARKET 
IT'S WORTH 
STARTING OUT BY SAYING THIS IS A 
LONG TERM STRATEGY THE TRENDS 
AROUND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES HAVE 
BEEN STRENGTHENING AROUND THE TWENTY OR 
THIRTY YEAR SWRES BEEN MANAGING THE 
FUND CERTAINLY OVER THREE OR FIVE 
YEARS THE FUND HAS BEEN 
OUTPERFORMING IT'S IMPORTANT FOR 
INDIVIDUALS TO LOOK AT THE FACT 
OVER THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE OF ITS 
FOCUS ON SMALL E. MIDCAPPED 
COMPANIES THAT ARE ARE VIDING THE 
SOLUTIONS IT WILL SHOW VOLATILITY 
FINALLY VERY INTERNATIONAL FUND 
WITH THE POUND SO WEAK AT THE 
MOMENT THAT MUST BE A PROBLEM AS 
WELL YOU MAY MAKE THE BEST 
INVESTMENT DECISION IN THE WORLD 
IF THE POUND IS FALLING BY THE TIME 
YOU HAVE BROUGHT IT HOME IT IS NOT 
WORTH MUCH 
TO INVEST IN 
ENVIRONMENTAM SOLUTIONS HAVE YOU TO 
TAKE A GLOBAL STRATEGY THE COMPANY 
AND THE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES ARE 
BEING SET UP AROUND THE WORLD 
AGAIN ACROSS JUPITER'S PORTFOLIOS 
WE DON'T HEDGE FOR CURRENCY IT IS 
SOMETHING THAT WITH OUR LONG TERM 
FOCUS WE BELIEVE CANCELS OUT OVER 
THE LONG TERM 
I KNOW IT'S A 
POPULAR GROWINGLY POPULAR PART OF 
THE MARKET GOOD LUCK FOR THE NEXT 
TWENTY YEARS AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY FOR 
THIS ONE WE WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW 
AT ONE THIRTY P. M.
