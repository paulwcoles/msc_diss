OTHERS THE E. D. F. ENERGY FINAL IS A 
REPEAT OF LAST YEAR'S WITH 
LEICESTER TIGERS LEICESTER TIGERS 
WHATEVER THE RESULT POLICE MORE OF 
THE SAME PLEASE MORE OF THE SAME THE OSPREYS ARE BACK A GREAT GREAT FINAL 
IS OVER 
YOU CAN ALMOST SMELL THE END OF THE 
SEASON WHEN THE SUN IS OUT IT 
FEELS LIKE SUMMER BUT WHEN IT IS 
NOT WE ARE PLUNGED BACK TO 
FEBRUARY 
THAT IS THE LAST TIME MOST OSPREYS 
PLACE LED BY RYAN JAMES THEY BEGAN 
AS POTENTIAL ALSO RUNS AND SEVEN 
WEEKS LATER HAD PLAYED FIVE AND FIFTEEN 
THE OSPREYS INFLUENCE CRUCIAL ON 
THE OPENING DAY AGAINST ENGLAND 
THE SAME OSPREYS WERE IN A 
DEVASTATING FORM IN THE SEMI FINAL 
AT CARDIFF AGAINST SARACENS THEIR 
STYLE OF RUGBY IS THE TYPE THAT 
TERRIFIES OPPONENTS AND SHANE 
WILLIAMS IS WORTH ADMISSION 
WHATEVER SHIRT HE IS WEARING 
THEY NEEDED BADLY ALL THE TROPHY 
CABINET COULD BE BED THIS SEASON 
WE HAVE MOVED INDOORS AND THE SUN 
IS OUT WE HOPE FOR A REALLY GOOD 
FINAL REPRESENTING THE WELSH CAMP 
IS FORMAT NEATH PLAYER JONATHAN 
DAVIES AND AUSTIN HEALEY THE 
COMPETITION HAS A LOT OF DETRACTORS 
BUT WE CANNOT TELL A BETTER FINAL 
IN POTENTIAL 
IT HAS A STUTTERING 
START EVERYONE COMPLAINS BUT WHEN 
IT GETS TO THE SEMI FINALS AND 
FINALS WE HAVE HAD SOME FANTASTIC 
GAMES THE TWO BEST SIDES ARE IN 
THE FINAL TODAY 
ABSOLUTELY YOU DO 
NOT KNOW WHO WILL WIN THE GAME IT 
IS SO TIGHTLY MATCH IF THE WEATHER 
CHANGES ONE WAY OR IT MAY FAVOUR 
ONE SIDE OSPREYS LIKE OPEN STYLE 
THE WEATHER COULD HAVE A BIG 
OUTCOME 
BEFORE WE FOCUS ON THE OUTCOME MATCH WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE 
GREY BURNING ISSUE OF THE ENGLISH 
GAME IS MARTIN JOHNSON AT TAKING 
THE JOB AS ENGLAND SUPREMO YOU 
MUST BE THE MAN WHO HAS HIS EAR HE HE IS NOT SAYING A GREAT LOSS MANY 
PEOPLE OFFERED JOBS BEHIND PEOPLE'S 
BACKS I HAVE BEEN OFFERED YOUR JOB 
AND IF YOU CARRY ARE WE THIS LINE 
OF QUESTIONING I WILL BE INCLINED 
TO TAKE IT THERE IS A LOT OF 
TALKING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS THERE

DISARRAY LONG MAY IT CONTINUE 
FROM WELSH PERSPECTIVE YOU WILL 
BE DELIGHTED SHAUN EDWARDS IS 
GOING TO REMAIN AS PART OF THE 
WELSH COACHING SET UP YOU HAVE A

GOT ON VERY WELL WE TALKED ABOUT 
RUGBY AND TACTICS HE LEADS THE N. F. L. 
AS WELL IT WAS ENJOYABLE IN THE 
END THAT HAPPENED LATE THERE WAS

DISCUSS THERE L. HAD A CHAT WITH 
MARTIN AND HE ASKED WHERE I WAS UP

DISAPPOINTED

AROUND AND TALKING TO PEOPLE MAYBE 
HE IS JUST INTERESTED 
LET'S TELLY 
ABOUT A COUPLE OF GAMES EARLIER 
TODAY THREE FINALS HE TODAY THE 
INTERMEDIATE FINAL KICK OFF AT TEN A M. 
BETWEEN BIRKENHEAD PARK THE FIRST 
CLUB AUSTIN HEALEY PLAYED FOR THAT 
WAS DAVID BLYTH SCORING THE FIRST 
OF TWO TRIES 
THAT WAS SIMON LOVE IT MUST HAVE 
FELT LIKE FIFTEEN HUNDRED METRES THAT WAS SIX 
MINUTES TO GO THE VICTORY FOR 
CHESTER IN THE INTERMEDIATE FINALS 
WERE YOU HER BRIGHT AND EARLY TO 
SEE THERE 
ABSOLUTELY THE FIRST 
CLUB YOU PLAY FOR WILL ALWAYS 
REMAIN WITH YOU IT IS GREAT IT IS 
GOING OUT TO THE SMALLER CLUBS 
STRANGELY HAD TWO CLUBS TEN MILES 
FROM OUR OLD HOUSE IN THE FINAL 
HOPEFULLY MY FINAL CLUB WOULD DO 
BETTER 
NOT GOOD FOR THE CARBON BETTER FOOTPRINT THEY COULD TELL PLAYED A 
WATERLOO MOVING ON TO THE NATIONAL 
TROPHY FINAL WHICH PHYLLIS TEN 
MINUTES AGO NORTHAMPTON FANS ARE 
DEVOTED TO THE GUYS THE SAINTS GOT 
OFF TO THE BEST POSSIBLE START IT 
SEEMED AS THOUGH THEY WOULD 
RUN 
AWAY WITH IT IN THE SECOND HALF 
THE EXETER CHASE CAME BACK INTO 
CONTENTION TWO REALLY BIG SIDES HAVE HAD 
DOMINATED NATIONAL DIVISION ONE 
THIS SEASON NORTHAMPTON WILL BE 
PLAYING IN THE PREMIERSHIP NEXT 
SEASON DYLAN HARLEY PLAYING FOR 
NORTHAMPTON TODAY HE COULD BE ON 
THE ENGLAND TOUR IN THE WINTER 
CHRIS ASHTON OUTSIDE THERE HAS BEEN 
THE MOST PROLIFIC TRY SCORER IN 
ENGLISH RUGBY THIS SEASON WHO IS 
TO SAY HE WILL NOT PLAY FOR THE 
FULL ENGLAND TEAM BEFORE LONG 
VICTORY FOR THE SAINTS IN AGAIN 
THAT TAKES US ON SUIT THIS MATCH 
TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES AWAY FROM KICK OFF 
THE OSPREYS BOYS ARE IN A HUDDLE 
BEHIND US WHAT KIND OF A GAME CAN 
WE EXPECT 
NOT SURE THEY HAD THE 
BIG HER CUP WHEN THEY LOST AGAINST 
SARACENS IT DEPENDS HOW THEY REACT 
TO THE DEFEAT IT IS A BIG GAME FOR 
THEM IF THEY DO NO WIN TODAY THAT 
IS IT THE EXPECTATION IN WALES IS 
GREAT FOR THIS SIDE NOSE TO PLAY 
FOR WALES IT IS A PRESSURE 
SITUATION MOST PLAY FOR WALES 
LAST WEEK THEY CREATED A LOT OF 
OPPORTUNITIES AND SQUANDERED THEM 
ALL THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO THAT 
TODAY 
YOU TALK ABOUT THE PLAY IS TODAY UNDER PRESSURE THE COACH WILL BE 
FEELING THE HEAT MORE THAN ANYBODY 
A LITTLE BIRD SAYS YOU WERE RUNNING 
IN RICHMOND PARK DID THAT HELP 
CLEAR THE MIND 
IT HELPS WHEN YOU GONNA SO MANY 
THOUGHTS FANTASTIC 
HOW MUCH 
PRESSURE WOULD YOU SAY YOU ARE 
UNDER AFTER WHAT HAPPENED AT 
SARACENS LAST WEEK 
A LOT OF 
DISAPPOINTMENT FROM LAST WEEK WHEN 
YOU'RE CONSTANTLY PERFORMING AT A 
HIGH LEVEL YOU WILL GET THE 
OCCASIONAL DIP L. AM SURE THERE 
WILL BE NO MISTAKES THIS WEEK WE 
HAVE TRAINED AND PREPARED WELL WE 
ARE SHARPER L. AM LOOKING FORWARD 
TO IT 
A REPEAT OF LAST YEAR'S 
FINAL HOW CONFIDENT YOU CAN 
REVERSE THE RESULT PRETTY PRETTY CONFIDENT WE HAVE TURNED UP TODAY 
WITH A BIG FOCUS LAST YEAR WAS A 
FREAK BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAPPEN TO 
US BEFORE OR SINCE WE HAD TO TURN 
THE TABLES AROUND 
GOOD STUFF GOOD 
LUCK LUCK SHANE WILLIAMS IS PLAYING YOU JUST 
WANT TO SEE HIM PLAY BECAUSE HE IS 
AN EXCITING PLAYER PERHAPS THE 
MOST EXCITING PLAYER IN THE WORLD 
GAVIN HENSON IS NOT TAKING PLUS 
HOW BIG A LOSS IS THE TWO OSPREYS 
QUITE A BIG LOSS HE HAS BEEN IN 
GOOD FORM AND CENTRAL TO THE WAY 
THE NEW FORD WITHOUT HIM THEY 
WILL PLAY A MORE ATTRACTIVE WHY THE 
GAME GAVIN HAS DEVELOPED THIS 
STRONG INSIDE CENTRE APPLY WHERE HE 
TAKES THE BALL UP AND BIG TACKLES 
OVERALL IT WILL NOT AFFECT THEM 
TOO MUCH 
THE TIGERS WE WILL TALK 
ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS ARE SHORTLY 
LET'S FOCUS ON THEIR COACHING MAN 
RICHARD POSSIBLY YOUR ONLY CHANCE 
OF SILVERWARE THIS SEASON IS IT 
TAKE DOUBLY DETERMINED TEAM I I THINK SO THE OSPREYS ARE A GRAND 
SLAM WINNING TEAM IN MANY RESPECTS 
WE NEED TO QUALIFY FOR EUROPE AND 
THIS IS A WAY IN WE WANT 
SILVERWARE IT MIGHT BE THE ONLY 
CHANCE 
SMITH 
ON THE WING VARNDELL CHANCE ON THE BENCH ONE EYE ON TUESDAY 
NIGHT AND BATH IN THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE 
NO OLLIE SMITH IS ON FORM LEAGUE PACE TO BYRNE IT SUITS US TODAY A 
VERY GOOD TEAM THE WEATHER IS 
SHOWERY AND GREASY IT WILL BE A 
DAY FOR THE FORWARDS AND TRIED TO 
STOP OSPREYS PLAYING EXPANSIVE 
GAMES 
HOW MUCH DO FEAR THE SIDE GAMES WITH A POINT TO PROVE AFTER THE 
EXIT TO SARACENS 
A HUGE AMOUNT OF 
RESPECT NOT A HUGE AMOUNT OF FEAR 
TO BE FAIR 
SURELY NOT THEY ARE A 
GRAND SLAM WINNING SIDE 
WE ARE A 
GOOD TEAM AS WELL WE ARE USED TO 
THE BIG STAGE WE WON TROPHIES LAST 
YEAR WE ARE A WELL STRONG SIDE 
THE RAIN HAS STARTED LET'S HOPE IT 
DOES A TOUCH TOO MUCH OF AN IMPACT 
INTERESTING POINT BY RICHARD 
COCKERILL THEY PICKED OLLIE SMITH 
ON THE WINGER TO COUNTERACT SHANE 
WILLIAMS WOULD YOU MAKE OF THAT A A HUGE MISTAKE OLLIE SMITH IS NOT A 
WINGER YOU NEED EXPERIENCED IN THE 
POSITION SHANE WILL LOVE IT HE 
WILL STEP ON THE INSIDE ALL THE 
TIME OLLIE SMITH WAS SCARED THAT 
IS AS A SHOULDER IT IS A MASSIVE 
MISTAKE 
THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE THE MISTAKE PACE VARNDELL HE IS LIGHTNING 
QUICK THIS IS THE OCCASION HE 
EXPLAINED IT WILL BE A FANTASTIC 
CHALLENGE FOR VARNDELL A CATT AND 
US THAN THE DECISION 
LET'S FOCUS 
ON SOMEONE WHO TO CURE MANTLE AT 
WELFORD ROAD HARRY ELLIS HE HAS 
BEEN INJURED FOR THE PAST YEAR HE 
IS RETURNING TO SOMETHING LIKE HIS 
OLD FORM HE IS PROBABLY THE MAN 
WHO CAN TAKE HOLD OF THE ENGLAND NO 
NINE JERSEY 
YOU LIKE TO THINK SO 
REMARKABLE THE WAY HE HAS COME BACK 
TO COME BACK AND AFTER A MONTH TO 
BE AT FULL SPEED AGAIN IT IS GREAT 
THE PRESSURE HE APPLIES ON THE 
OPPOSITION IN DEFENCE AND SPEED HE 
OPERATES HAVING HIM BACK HAS 
TRANSFORMED THE LEICESTER BACK LINE 
JUSTIN MARSHALL HE IS AN ENIGMATIC 
FIGURE THIS MIGHT BE THE LAST BIG 
OCCASION HE PLAYS HE WOULD HAVE 
POINT TO PROVE 
HE DIDN'T HAVE HIS 
BEST GAME LAST WEEK BUT HE HAS BEEN 
THERE DONE THAT HE IS A CLASS 
PLAYER HE IS DIFFERENT PLAYER TO 
MICHAEL PHILLIPS A DIFFERENT 
PLAYER THIS IS THE BAD START HE 
BRINGS PEOPLE INTO THE GAME HE HAS 
A BIG ROLE TO PLAY TODAY IT IS 
MOTIVATING HIM TO SAY WE HAD THE HE 
CUP LAST WEEK IT'S TIME TO TURN 
THINGS AROUND 
DOES THIS HELP THE 
TIGERS 
IT DOES IT PLAYS INTO LESS TIGERS THE'S HANDS THEY WOULD TRY AND 
DOMINATE THE BREAKDOWN THE OSPREYS 
I THOUGHT BEFORE THE WEATHER WOULD 
HAVE EXPANDED THE GAME THIS PLACE 
TOWARDS LEICESTER 
WE MENTIONED IN 
A FEW TIMES YOU DO GET TIRED OF 
TALKING AS SOMEONE WHO IS AS 
EXCITING AND ENERGISING A PLAYER AS 
WILLIAMS THIS SEASON HE HAS BEEN 
BETTER THAN EVER 
AT THE MOMENT 
THERE IS NO BETTER PLAYER IN THE 
WORLD BACK AT CLUB LEVEL AFTER 
BEING SLASHED THIS SEASON HE WAS 
NOT IN THE GAME AGAINST ULSTER TWO 
TRIES OUT OF NOTHING HE IS PLAYING 
OUT OF HIS SKIN CONFIDENCE IS HIGH 
HE KNOWS WHEN TO KICK AND COME OFF 
HIS WING HE LOOKS FOR WORK AND 
SPOTS MISMATCHES IN MIDFIELD WITH 
THE BIG FORWARDS HE IS A JOY TO 
WATCH 
HOW DOES HE MANAGE TO NOT WATCH FIND HIMSELF IN A SITUATION WHERE 
THERE ARE SEVENTEEN STONE SECOND ROWS 
RUNNING AT HIM AND HE IS NOT 
STEAMROLLERED 
AGILITY IF YOU KNOW STEAMROLLERED A BIG GUY IS COMING AT YOU AND YOU 
CAN MOVE TO INCHES HE WILL NOT 
TAKE YOU HEAD ON PEOPLE 
UNDERESTIMATE HIS STRENGTH WHEN HE 
STARTED HE WAS A FASTER GUY NOW 
HIS LEG STUMP IS PHENOMENAL HE IS 
EXPLODING THROUGH 
ONE OF THE 
STRONGEST IN THE WELSH SQUAD ON 
THE LEG PRESS HE WAS IN CONTACT 
BEFORE YOU DO NOT SEE THAT ANY 
MORE HE IS THE COMPLETE PACKAGE 
THE BRAIN IS HAMMERING DOWN IT 
OBSCURES THE FLAG FOR MANY WELSH 
PLAYERS THE LAST TIME THEY WERE 
HERE WAS ONLY TEN WEEKS AGO WHEN 
BRIAN JONES SAID TO THEM IN THE 
DRESSING ROOM GUYS THEY ARE ONLY 
ENGLAND WOULD HE BE SAY THEY ARE 
ONLY LEICESTER TODAY 
I THINK SO 
IF THEY PERFORM THEY CAN BEAT 
ANYONE EVERY TIME THEY HAVE BEEN 
HERE WALES WERE NINETEEN POINTS DOWN 
LAST YEAR IN THE FINAL DOWN 
AGAINST LEICESTER THEY CANNOT 
AFFORD TO START SLOWLY TODAY THEY 
MUST COME OUT OF THEIR BLOCKS WITH 
CONFIDENCE AFTER LAST WEEK'S DEFEAT 
IT IS A BIG GAME FOR THEM THEY 
HAVE IT ALL TO DO THEY ARE THE 
UNDERDOGS 
LEICESTER KNOW THIS IS A UNDERDOGS MASSIVE GAME FOR THEM THEY HAVE 
DROPPED OUT OF THE TOP FOUR IN THE 
PREMIERSHIP WITHOUT A WIN THEY 
COULD FINISH WITHOUT ANY SILVERWARE 
IT IS ABSOLUTELY HAMMERING DOWN 
AUSTIN A GOOD JOB WE HAVE 
ECONOMISED WHERE WE HAVE NO 
UMBRELLA WE ARE GOING TO LEAVE THE 
SITE OF THE PITCH AND HANDOVER TO 
HE WILL WIN 
I FEEL LEICESTER HAVE 
THE EDGE 
NOW IT IS RAINING MY 
MUMMY IS ON ESTHER 
A THREE POINT 
MATCH WHICH GIVES YOU HOW CLOSE IT 
MIGHT BE 
ON LEICESTER 
WE WILL 
VACATE THE STAGE AND LEAVE IT FOR 
THE COMMENTARY TEAM THE LAST TIME 
YOU'LL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF WITS OF 
BRIAN MOORE AND EDDIE BUTLER A HANDOVER TO US AND A SHOT OF AN 
IDIOT BIRD IT IS HAMMERING DOWN IN 
TWICKENHAM TWICKENHAM THEY SPRING SHOWER 
WELL THIS GUY'S DO NOT LOOK 
UNRELENTING POTENTIALLY THIS HAS 
THE HALLMARKS OF A CRACKER BUT THIS 
ALSO LEICESTER MORE THEY ARE USED 
TO PLAYING IN THIS WE WILL SEE HOW 
THE OSPREYS SECOND ROW IS 
PARTICULARLY ALUN WYN JONES 
SARACENS UPSET THE OSPREYS RHYTHM 
FROM THE WALES GRAND SLAM THROUGH 
THE SEMI FINAL AGAINST SARACENS 
OSPREYS KEPT GOING AND GOING THEY 
COMPLETELY WERE DERAILED LAST WEEK 
WELL THAT HAVE A BEARING 
I DOUBT IT SILVERWARE L. AM 
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE HALF BACK 
BATTLE BATTLE AS YOU CAN SEE IT IS NOT THE BEST 
DAY FOR RUGBY THEN AGAIN LOT OF 
INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS ARE 
PROFESSIONAL AND MASCOT MINUTE 
HARRY ELLIS ON HIS RETURN JOURNEY 
OUTSTANDING ON HIS IMMEDIATE RETURN 
HE IS BECAUSE JUSTIN MARSHALL HE 
HAD A POOR GAME IN THE FINAL LAST 
YEAR BUT REMAINS AND EIGHTY ONE CUP ALL 
BLACK HE IS UP AGAINST JUSTIN 
MARSHALL MARTIN CORRY THIRTY FOUR YEARS OLD OVER SIXTY 
CAPS FOR ENGLAND ONE OF THE GREAT 
TRIERS OF RUGBY HE LEADS OUT THE 
TIGERS A WELCOME BLAST OF HEAT 
FROM THOSE FLAMES OPPOSITE HIM 
WEARING NUMBER SIX RYAN JAMES 
GRANDSON CAPTAIN NAME FOUR MACRO 
TAKES OVER AT EIGHT FILO TIATIA 
TAKES THERE AT EIGHT DOLLARS AND 
THOMAS GOES TO THE BENCH THE 
LEICESTER BEN HERRING THE NEW ZEALANDER PLAYS SEVEN RICHARD HIBBARD POSITIVE NOT IN THE WELSH TEAM YET WHO WILL COME OFF THE BENCH TOM 
CROFT ON THE BENCH FOR ENGLAND TOM 
VARNDELL HE WAS DROPPED FOR OLLIE 
SMITH THE RAIN HAS EASED ALAIN ROLLAND 
IS THE REFEREE THE E. D. F. ENERGY CUP 
FINAL AT TWICKENHAM A GOOD CROWD 
EXCELLENT PLAYING SURFACE GREAT 
REPUTATION FOR PLAYERS SUCH AS 
JUSTIN MARSHALL A REPEAT OF LAST 
YEAR'S FINAL WHEN THE OSPREYS 
STARTED HORRIBLY IT TURNS IN THE 
END INTO A CLASSIC THE OSPREYS 
WERE ABJECT LEICESTER IN POSSESSION HARRY ELLIS CHECKS WHERE GOODE IS ADAM JONES THE PROP WILL PLAY SCRUM HALF OSPREYS HAD SCRAMBLED IT BACK AND INCONCLUSIVE START FOR BOTH 
SIDES INTERESTINGLY LEICESTER'S 
BACK LINE WHEN DEFENDING HAS ANDY 
GOODE WELL BACK AT FULL BACK NOT 
QUITE CERTAIN WHY THAT IS BUT WE 
WILL SEE AS IT DEVELOPS THIS WILL 
BE AN IMPORTANT AREA AS WELL IT IS INTERESTING HOW LEICESTER ARE 
A LINES ON THIS VERY NEAR TOUCHLINE 
FULLBACK JOHNNY MURPHY THE OSPREYS GO UP IN THE FRONT ROW 
ALAIN ROLLAND EXPLANATION COMING 
NO HE SIGNALS FRONT ROW STANDING 
UP BUT HE COULD EASILY HAVE GOT THE 
OSPREYS FOR PULLING THE SCRUM ROUND A KNOWING STARE FROM ALAIN ROLLAND ANDY GOODE FROM HIS OWN HALF IT 
LOOKS LOOKING AT THE FLAGS AS IF 
HE HAS NO ASSISTANCE FROM THE WIND SHORT BY A MILE IAIN EVANS MAKES THE CATCH NOT ALL IT COULD HAVE BEEN THAT 
ONLY FIFTEEN METRES FROM WHERE HE KICKED 
IT THE LEICESTER LINE OUT IS USUALLY 
SOLID CHUTER A GOOD CONFIDENT 
FLOWER THROWER MARTIN CORRY CLAIMED IT JORDAN CRANE A COUPLE OF ONCE AGAIN THE OSPREYS GIVE AWAY A 
PENALTY IRELAND DON'T AND SAYING 
PULLING MAN INTO THE ROCK HE WAS 
NOT INVOLVED WAS PROBABLY HARRY 
ELLIS ALAN I WAS ABOUT TO SAY OSPREYS HAD DONE 
WELL TO SLOW THE BALL DOWN GET OUT 
AND DEFEND SO ONE OF THOSE STARS BY THE 
OSPREYS THEY CANNOT GET OUT OF 
THEIR BLOCKS AT THE GAP LEICESTER INTO THE LEAD HAVE 
THEY IDENTIFIED A REASON WHY THEY START OFF SLOWLY IT IS 
APPARENT THEY WENT SHORT LAST TIME 
BUT THE CHASING WAS INEFFECTUAL 
LET'S SEE WHAT IT IS BETTER THIS 
TIME MORE HEIGHT GREAT WORK BY JAMES THEY WILL GO 
BACK OUTSIDE THE TWENTY TWO THE KICK 
THAT IS VERY SCARY STUFF SO 
NEARLY AN INTERCEPTION HOW MANY 
HAVE WE SEEN THIS SEASON 
THAT MAN DID INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT 
WORK LEICESTER WERE FLYING OSPREYS MANAGED TO GET THE BALL TO 
GROUND THEY HAVE DONE WELL ON THE 
LINE OUTS GOOD WORK BY RICHARD HIBBARD TURNED OVER BY THE OSPREYS HOOKER PUT IT BEHIND A LEICESTER THROW TO SUE THE 
PIECES OF PLAY BY JAMES HOOK HAVE 
TAKEN THE OSPREYS SIXTY METRES FIRST 
OF ALL A DUMMY ACCELERATION HE 
COULD NOT GET OUT SIDE THERE ARE 
FIVE OR SIX PLAYERS HE COULD NOT 
GET THE BALL FREE LET'S SEE WHAT 
THE OSPREYS CAN DO AGAINST THE LESS 
THE THROW LEICESTER THROW WHO HAS HAD AN INJURY STANKOVICH 
A OF A BLOOD HE 
WILL BE O. K. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT THE 
OSPREYS DO ON THE GEORGE CHUTER 
THROW MARTIN CORRY THERE WAS A CASE FOR 
SECOND ROW LONG TIME AGO HE IS A USEFUL LINE OUT ADJUNCT SIX FOOT FIVE MARTIN CORRY I AM NOT SURE WHY HE IS TAKING SO LONG HERE HERE WE GO WELL TAKEN DEACON FIVE GOOD PROGRESS BEING MADE BY 
THE LEICESTER FORWARD WITH THE FOLLOW UP TACKLE 
NOT QUITE 
SURE WHY BYRNE WENT FOR THAT I HE 
CAME A LONG WAY FROM MIDFIELD HE 
WAS HOLDING ON TO THE BALL HE 
TRAINED IT WELL TIMED MURPHY COMES FORWARD HEARING IS CLEAR A 
EXCELLENT TACKLE BY TIATIA IS 
OUT SURELY A SWITCH OF PLAY 
GOOD OF LOT TO ANDY GOODE OF OLD 
SUPERB RECOVERY WORK 
THAT IS THE 
CORNER FLAG THERE ARE PLAYERS 
AVAILABLE ON THIS NEAR SIDE THEY CANNOT SAY 
THE FLY HALF THAT THE MOMENT AT THE MOMENT 
LEICESTER AHEAD AND REALLY THEY 
HAVE HAD ALL THE PLAY IT HAS BEEN 
ALL GREEN AND WHITE SO FAR THIS IS 
VERY SLOW FOR LEICESTER 
THAT MAY 
WELL BE TURNED OVER IF HE DID NOT 
GET THE BALL ON THE FLOOR 
IT IS UP 
SHORT STILL JUST 
WHO IS LETTING 
GO WHO IS HOLDING ON WHAT A MISS THE OSPREYS WHEN THAT LITTLE 
CONTEST THEY HELPED SHANE WILLIAMS 
THERE THEY ARRIVED IN NUMBERS IF IF IT WAS NOT JUST THAT IT WAS THEIR 
DETERMINED DEFENCE THAT BROUGHT 
DOWN THE TURNOVER IN THE END 
SEVERAL TIMES THEY COMMITTED 
THEMSELVES LIKE THIS HE TOOK HIS 
EYE OFF THE BALL A BIT JUST BEFORE 
HE WAS ABOUT TO RECEIVE IT IT WAS 
NOT A BAD PASS DEACON IS LINED JUST ABOUT WHERE 
THE OSPREYS MIDFIELD FLY IN 
LYING GOOD WORK BY THE OSPREYS 
FORWARDS 
I THOUGHT LEICESTER WERE FORWARDS OFFSIDE THERE HE IS CERTAINLY NOT 
ONSIDE ALUN 
JONES HELPED A ONSIDE LOT OF OSPREYS SHIRTS A PENALTY TO 
LEICESTER A LOT OF OSPREYS SHIRTS 
WERE LEFT BEHIND ON THE FLOOR YES YES 
HE GOES DOWN AND HE HAS TO LET GO 
OF THEIR LET GO THERE IT WAS A 
SHAME BECAUSE THEY HAD TO HAVE AND 
TEN OR TWELVE METRES GIRVAN DRIVEN 
YOU HAVE TO GET IT WHEN IT IS STILL 
MOVING BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO AN 
END IT DOES NOT SUIT THE DEFENCE 
PARTICULARLY 
THE RAIN HAS STOPPED PARTICULARLY THERE IS BLUE SKY OVERHEAD THAT 
HAS GOT THE DISTANCE NOT QUITE THE 
ACCURACY OF FULL STOP THE THE PROBLEM IS THE OSPREYS HAVE HAD NO 
FIELD POSITION THAT OFFER THE FIRST 
FIFTEEN MINUTES THEIR ATTACKS HAVE COME 
FROM DEEP THERE WAS A MARGIN FOR 
ERROR THERE HOW CLOSE WAS THIS 
VERY HE WAS UNLUCKY THE UPSHOT IS 
THAT LEICESTER HAVE A GREAT 
ATTACKING POSITION 
TWO PLAYERS 
DIRECTLY BEHIND THE SCRUM AND ANDY GOODE SIX TO ZERO LEICESTER LEAD ANDY GOODE 
DECIDED IN 
THE END THE BALL THE NUMBER EIGHT 
TO ELLIS I HE HAD TO WAIT AND THEREFORE THE DEFENCE 
WAS RIGHT THEN HIS FACE IN HIS 
FACE THREE THREE POINTS 
OSPREYS HAVE HAD ONE ATTACK IT HAS 
BEEN ALL LEICESTER THE FORWARDS IN FRONT OF HIM HAVE 
TO GET BACK WELL TAKEN BOOK IT COVERED HOOK WITH ONLY THEIR SECOND ATTACK THEY 
HAVE A CHANCE FOR POINTS 
WHAT A 
PLAYER JAMES HOOK IS TWICE HE HAS 
MADE SEARING BREAKS HE GETS A 
FAVOURABLE BOUNCE BUT LOOK AT THAT MARSHALL KEEPING OUT OF THE WAY ANDY GOODE IS HAVING TEN ATTENTION 
THIS IS NOT AN EASY KICK EITHER A 
LEICESTER SHARING THE POSSESSION 
THAT SURPRISES ME THE OSPREYS 
TERRITORY THAT MUST ONLY HAVE BEEN 
A FRACTION AND A LESSER HAVE 
BECAUSE IT HAS NOT BE ANYWHERE NEAR 
COME APART FROM ONE PARTICULAR TIME 
THE NEED THIS TO SETTLE THEM WAS THAT SHORT SHORT UNUSUAL 
JAMES COOK HAS ARRANGED FOR THAT 
SORT OF DISTANCE USUALLY RANGE 
IT WENT VERY HYPHAL SOME VERY 
HIGH PARKER HAD COME IN FATHER CLOSE 
PASS THAT PUTS THE OSPREYS INTO 
THE LEICESTER TWENTY TWO 
THEY NEED TIME IN 
THE LEICESTER HAVE THERE IS ANY 
PENALTIES THEY HAVE HAD HAVE BEEN 
VERY LONG RANGE BECAUSE IT 
LOOKED AS IF IT WAS GOING TO DRIFT 
THEN FILL SOME AT THE VERY LAST 
SECOND ITS IT DIPPED SLASH OSPREYS BALL AT THE SCRUM SHANE 
WILLIAMS HAS STARTED TO LEAVE HIS 
WIN HERE STANDING BEHIND JAMES 
HOOK HE IS NOT RIGHT ON THE WING I YEARS BEHIND THE SCRUM NOW TIATIA TAKES ON ELLIS MAKES A FEW 
YARDS A BIRD TAKES ON A CRANE AND 
MAKES A COUPLE OF YARDS HIBBARD 
A TRY FOR THE OSPREYS 
VERY SIMPLE 
ALMOST TRAINING GROUND STAFF ARE 
THE OSPREYS THE IMPORTANT THING 
WAS THE VERY QUICK BALL FOR 
MARSHALL LEICESTER WERE FOUND 
WANTING AT THE TACKLING ON THE GAME 
LINE FALSE L. AM SORRY THAT IS 
NOT GOOD ENOUGH TOO BECOME A FOUR THE KEY THING ABOUT THAT WAS THE 
SPEED OF THE FORWARDS THAT KEPT 
LEICESTER RUN THE BACK FOOT ON 
THE BACK FOOT LEICESTER DEPENDED 
THEY ERRORS BY NOT TACKLING ON THE 
GAME LINE 
JAMES AT THE THREE 
GAME LINE POINTS THIS TIME AFFAIR ONCE A 
QUESTION OVER WHETHER THE OSPREYS 
WITH MISS GAVIN HENSON COME OF THE 
ANSWER IS AND ALTHOUGH NO 
HAVE THE ABILITY TO PUT THE POINTS 
ON THE BOARD THAT WAS A BIT LONG FOR THE WINNER 
WINGER WAS VERY BROADCAST 
BY LEICESTER 
IT WAS POOR HE DID 
NOT HAVE ANY OPTION BUT HE HAD TO 
REACH FOR THE PASS 
HIBBARD VERY 
PROMISING FULL STOP WHO TOOK IT WELL AND KICKS IT 
STRAIGHT OUT HOOK 
THAT BALL JUST DIPPED IT MIGHT HAVE PUT HIM 
OFF BALANCE IT IS INTERESTING THE 
WAY THAT THE SECTOR DE VARENNE IN 
THEIR CHOICE OF OUT TO STOP THE 
DRIVE US FROM THE LINEOUT SIDES 
ARE DIFFERING OF THE TWO THE 
OSPREYS HAVE BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL 
BEN KAY POINTED OUT NUMBERS TO THE 
REFEREE THAT WAS A MORAL VICTORY 
TO THE OSPREYS IN THE DEBATING 
CHAMBER IT WAS BEN KAY TRYING TO DO 
THE NUMBERS AND THE OSPREYS TRYING 
TO GET THE BALL IN AND THE OSPREYS 
ONE FREE KICK TO THEM TIATIA DID WELL HE DID NOT DO 
WELL BUT THE IDEA WAS RIGHT 
I 
I THOUGHT THE ONE BEFORE WAS MORE OF 
A FALL PAST IT DOES NOT MATTERED 
IT HAS BEEN GIVEN OUT IT IS 
INTERESTING NOT IN MARSHALL 
WATCHING MARSHALL HE WILL RUN LEFT 
TO WRITE YOU CANNOT TAKE YOUR EYES 
OFF HIM BECAUSE HE IS SO STRONG IF 
YOU LEAVE HIM TO TAKE A GAP YOU'RE 
QUEEN TO PAY FOR IT 
HE TAKES SOME 
GETTING USED TO HE INVADES YOU TO 
RUN THE ANGLES AND STRAIGHTEN THE 
LINE WHILE HE IS DRIFTING 
INVITES YOU 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE 
COMPLAINING WHEN HE CAME COME I'VE 
BEEN BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ON HIS 
WAVELENGTH I THINK IT IS NOT 
USUAL FOR SCRUM HALVES TO STAY IN 
POSITION FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME 
LIKE THAT 
THERE IS THE WINNING THE BATTLE LEICESTER COULD 
BE IN TROUBLE LEICESTER HAVE HAD A 
POOR TEN MINUTES THEY HAVE BEEN 
CAUGHT ON THE BACK FOOT THEY NEED 
TO RE ESTABLISH SOME SORT OF 
MOMENTUM THE FORWARD PASS BY 
TIATIA THE REFEREE SAYING YOU'RE 
WALKING AROUND HE IS RIGHT L. 
WOULD NOT NECESSARILY SAY L. WOULD SEE 
IT WAS JOHN SPILLING BUT IT DOES NOT MATTER THE TIGERS WILL 
HAVE A THROW JUST OUTSIDE THE 
OSPREYS TWENTY TWO IT IS A GOOD POSITION 
A WESTERN NEEDED SOMETHING TO GET 
BACK ON TRACK LEICESTER BEN KAY DOING THE SUMS TALKING TO THE REFEREE AGAIN THE OSPREYS HAVE DROPPED 
THERE WOULD BE LESS TO DRIVE 
LEICESTER 
BRILLIANTLY TAKEN AND LEICESTER CUTS INSIDE AS HE REALISES HE IS 
RUNNING RUNNING OUT OF PACE AND 
SPACE PILE UP THE OSPREYS ATTACK 
COMES 
A VERY 
COMES TO NOTHING BUT IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS PLOY THIS WILL MAKE LESS 
TO THINK AGAIN SURELY 
LEICESTER 
FOR A MOMENT THERE HE'S GOT TEAM 
MATE OF THE WAY HE THOUGHT HE 
WOULD CALL ALL THE WAY THE THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT BURN IS A 
VERY TOP PLAYER SO HE WILL BE 
FIELDING THOSE CROSSFIELD KICKS SMITH CAN DUCK UNDER THE TACKLES 
TWICE HE MADE DIFFICULT SITUATION 
INTO UNEASY CLEAN IT'S INTO AN 
IT EASY CLEARANCE THE STANDARD OF 
COOKING HAS NOT BEEN PARTICULARLY 
GREAT FROM EITHER SIDE KICKING 
GOING BACK TO THAT CROSSFIELD KICK 
IT IS QUITE IMPORTANT TO GET 
SOMEONE STATIC BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE 
SOMEONE GOING FAR WOULD YOU HAVE A 
MOUNTAIN FORWARD THAT IS NOT THE BEST BALL BUT THE 
OSPREYS ARE GETTING SOME SPEED 
THAT IS BETTER GAVIN HENSON INJURED LAST WEEK AGAINST SARACENS MARSHALL THOUGHT THERE WAS AN 
OPENING THERE STILL MIGHT BE 
SOMETHING ON GOOD DRIVE BY STANKOVICH CROSSING IN FRONT OF LABOUR AND 
LEE BYRNE 
FEES DO DUG ABOUT TO 
LEE BYRNE WHACK SOMEBODY THERE AND THEN 
REALISE IT WAS CASTROGIOVANNI AND 
THOUGHT BETTER OF IT HE STOOD UP 
THE REASON HE HAD A CLEAN CATCH IN 
THE END WAS THAT THE CHEESE IT WAS 
SHEPHERDED OUT OF THE WAY CHASER 
HE JUST STOPS IN FRONT OF THE MAN 
NO REASON TO BE THERE HE KNEW WHAT 
HE WAS DOING CANNOT COMPLAIN LEICESTER GOING NOWHERE YET THEY 
WANT TO TACKLE HIPKISS EARLY 
BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW STRONG HE IS 
ON HIS FEET AFTER THE TACKLE 
PENALTY TO THE OSPREYS GOOD 
DEFENSIVE OPERATION FROM START TO 
FINISH WE AWAY 
HE IS GOING TO 
SPEAK TO SOMEONE AS WELL 
IT COULD 
BE YELLOW NO NOTHING IT IS GOING 
TO BE A PENALTY SMACK IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE FIELD JAMES COOK S. DO 
MINUTE TOWARDS THE CORNER THE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE LAST TWENTY MINUTES 
HAS BEEN THE FIRST FIFTEEN USED OFFER 
LEICESTER BEN HEADING MAKING A 
COUPLE OF DRIVES THE LEICESTER 
ABOUT ROLE THE LAST TWENTY MINUTES IT 
HAS BEEN REVERSED JONES AND TIATIA 
HAVE BEEN FEATURING MORE AND MORE 
AND THAT IS WHERE THE BASIS OF THE 
CHANGING FORTUNES HAS COME FROM THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE STUCK A GUN 
THAT TOUCH LINE ONE THAT TOUCH 
LINE MARSHALL LENT WEIGHT AND 
COMES BACK ROUND 
I AM NOT SURE WHY 
THE REFEREE DID NOT CONSIDER THAT 
HAD BEEN COLLAPSED 
THE OSPREYS WON 
A PENALTY THIS MIGHT BE YELLOW A A WARM AND I THINK WARNING 
THE BALL ALONE THAT IS NOT VERY 
MUCH THAT IS A WARNING WAS 
ABOUT TO SAY I WISH HE WOULD GET 
TEAMS EARLIER IN THIS BECAUSE I 
THINK ALONG A FEW TENS IF HE BLEW 
EARLIER THEN IT WOULD STOP PEOPLE 
PLAYING NEGATIVELY 
FOR A SIDE THAT 
STARTS BADLY TO BE SEVEN TO SIX UP AT 
TWICKENHAM AND WITH THIS PENALTY 
THEY MUST BE FEELING PRETTY GOOD AND USUALLY THE OSPREYS DRIVING 
WALLS HAVE BEEN STAYING ON THEIR 
FEET AND UNUSUALLY 
ACROSS THE 
ACROSS THE FACE OF THE POST JUST ONE OUT OF 
THE THREE 
IT WAS AN EASY 
THE THREE IT WAS NOT AN EASY KICK BUT THE UPSHOT IS THAT THE 
OSPREYS DE DOWN THERE AT RECEIVE 
THIS IN THEIR OWN HALF THE OSPREYS HAVE LET THAT HAPPEN A 
COUPLE OF TIMES NOW GOOD ATTACKS 
AND THEN THE BALL POPS OUT AND NO 
ONE IS THERE MARSHALL FORTY YARDS 
AWAY FROM THE BREAKDOWN AREA 
HE IS 
SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS BECAUSE HE 
KNOWS THE OSPREYS SHOULD HAVE 
CONVERTED THERE SUPER PASSAGE OF 
PLAY WHICH HE STARTED WITH A 
SUPREME PIECE OF HANDLING PARKER DECIDED TO TAKE THE CONTACT 
A CHANCE GONE BEGGING 
AND OSPREYS 
THROW MAYBE THE LAST PLAY OF THIS 
FIRST HALF DOES LOOK GO FOR GOAL OR THE CORNER HE IS GOING FOR THE CORNER AN ATTACKING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE 
OSPREYS THEY WANT THIS TO BE THE 
LAST DECISIVE PLAYER OF THE FIRST 
HALF 
YOU MENTIONED OSPREYS BEING HALF PLEASED WITH THIS IF THEY DO NOT 
SCORE HERE LEICESTER WILL BE 
PLEASED BECAUSE THEY HAVE HAD A 
POOR LAST TWENTY MINUTES AGAIN IT HAS GONE LOOSE SHANE 
WILLIAMS HAS TO GO BACK TO RETRIEVE HE IS JUST A JOY FANTASTIC TO WATCH ISN'T IT BYRNE TOOK ON HERRING AND BEATEN WITH THE HAND OFF MARSHALL DIDN'T WANT TO PUT SHANE WILLIAMS AGAINST TWO DEFENDERS ON HIS OWN ANDY GOODE HAS GOT BACK THERE IT 
SEEMS JAMES HOOK WAS IN THE CLEAR 
GOOD COVERING BY ANDY GOODE GOOD OPENING BY LEICESTER THEN IT 
WAS ALL OSPREYS THE WELSH TEAM 
LEAD AT HALF TIME IN THE E. D. F. ENERGY 
CUP FINAL BY SEVEN POINTS TO SIX IT IS A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY DAY NOW BUT 
IT STARTED OF MISERABLE ANDY GOODE 
WITH PENALTY AND DROP KICK THE 
FIRST TWENTY FIVE MINUTES WAS NEITHER HERE 
NOR THERE JAMES HOOK HAD SOME 
GREAT BREAKS A MARVELLOUS TACKLE 
BY HARRY ELLIS ANDY BISHOP OVER 
THE MAN REPLACING GAVIN HENSON THE 
PENALTY WENT ASTRAY SEVEN TO SIX AT HALF 
TIME THE FORCE IS WITH THE OSPREYS 
THEY SCORED THE ONLY TRY AND WERE 
IN THE ASCENDANCY AS THE HALF TIME 
WHISTLE WAS BLOWN EARLIER WE HAD 
THE FINAL OF THE EADIE OF TROPHY 
WHICH SAW NORTHAMPTON SAINTS BEAT 
EXETER JEEVES X. ACHIEVES L. ASKED 
IF HE WAS WATCHING THE OSPREYS 
AGAINST LEICESTER HE SAID NO IT 
CAPS A GREAT SEASON FOR YOU BACK 
IN THE PREMIERSHIP 
WE ARE VERY 
PLEASED WE HAVE WORKED HARD TO GET 
THERE FULL CREDIT COACHES AND THE 
SQUAD EVERYONE HAS WORKED HARD TO 
ACHIEVE THE GOALS WE HAVE TWO MORE 
GAMES TO FINISH THE SEASON UNBEATEN 
A SEASON IN DIVISION ONE DIDN'T DO 
HARLEQUINS ANY HARM DO YOU FEEL AS 
A SQUAD TO HAVE EMERGED STRONGER 
DEFINITELY WE HAD TOO MANY CRACKS 
IN THE SQUAD AND MANAGEMENT THAT 
IS ALL SORTED EVERYONE HAS WORKED 
HARD TO GET THAT RIGHT WE HAVE 
ACCRUED IT WELL FOR NEXT YEAR TO TO BELIEVE THE CRACKS ARE PLASTERED 
OVER BECAUSE THERE WERE RUMOURS OF 
DIVISION AND CLIQUES AMONGST THE 
KIWI CONTINGENT AMONGST THE REST 
EVERYONE HAS WORKED HARD WE KNOW 
NO ONE IS BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE 
WE ARE AS STRONG AS EACH OTHER 
FULL CREDIT TO EVERYONE INVOLVED 
SOME GOOD YOUNG PLAYERS DYLAN 
HARLEY POSSIBLY GOING WITH ENGLAND 
HOW DO YOU FEEL YOU WILL THEN NEXT 
SEASON 
IT IS A TOUGH IT IS A SEASON MASSIVE STEP UP WE HAVE RECRUITED 
WELL WHAT THESE YOUNG FELLOWS 
COMING THROUGH WITH THE NEW 
TRAINER HE WILL PUSH THEM THROUGH 
TO THEIR BOUNDARIES 
WE YOU STAY AS 
CAPTAIN 
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO WE CAPTAIN HAD NEW GUYS COMING IN 
GOOD STUFF 
BREEZE THEY HAVE BEEN DYING TO 
FILL THE CHAMPAGNE TROPHY WITH 
CHAMPAGNE IT LEAKS OUT OF THE 
SIDES SIDES TWO MORE GAMES BEFORE NORTHAMPTON 
CAN CLAIM AN UNBEATEN RECORD FOR 
THE SEASON IT IS SUMMER IN 
TWICKENHAM THIS AFTERNOON THOSE 
FIGURES TWENTY MINUTES AGO WOULD HAVE 
BEEN SO DIFFERENT IT WAS ALL 
LEICESTER POSSESSION AND TERRITORY 
LOOK AT THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES OF THE 
GAME HAVE CHANGED THE FIGURES 
LEICESTER STARTED STRONGLY 
DOMINATED 
THE DEFENCE WAS GOOD THE BALL HAS BEEN SLOW BEING RECYCLED 
LEICESTER REALLY HAD THEM RECYCLED UNDER THE HAMMER FOR THE FIRST FIFTEEN 
OR TWENTY MINUTES 
WHEN IT WAS POURING 
DOWN PRE MATCH WE THOUGHT THIS 
SUITS LEICESTER IT SEEMED TO STOP 
AND COINCIDE WITH THE RESURGENCE OF 
THE OSPREYS THE BALL DRIED UP 
THEY GOT A QUICKER BALL LEICESTER 
ARE NOT COMPETING HARD ENOUGH AT 
EVERY BREAKDOWN JUSTIN MARSHALL 
HE IS A GREAT SCRUM HALF BUT HE IS 
SLOWING THEIR OWN BALL DOWN 
LEICESTER SHOULD TARGET THAT THE 
SECOND HALF 
THEY GAVE FOR 
PENALTIES AWAY NO FEAR POSITION 
THE OSPREYS THEY HAVE TURNED IT 
AROUND 
PERHAPS NOT A HUGE AMOUNT AROUND OF CREATIVITY JAMES COOKE HAS WON 
A TOOK SHIMMIES WHICH MAKES YOU 
THINK WITH MORE SPACE WHO KNOWS 
WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN JAMES BROOKE 
THINK WITH MORE SPACE WHO KNOWS WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN JAMES BROOKE 
FROM HERE A QUICK TAP THROWS A 
DUMMY JUST ON THE OUTSIDE HIPKISS 
COMES IN AGAIN A CHIP AHEAD HE 
EXPOSES HIMSELF HERE 
THIS IS A FANTASTIC TACKLE HARRY 
ELLIS 
IF HARRY DOES NOT MAKE THE ELLIS TACKLE HE LOOK GETS OUT 
UP WHEN HE HAS THE BALL WITH NO 
OPTION HE IS ELUSIVE 
WHEN THEY DO 
RECYCLE HE NEEDS TO RUN RUNNERS 
EITHER SIDE OF HIM 
WE SPOKE ABOUT THERE BEING NO GAVIN 
HENSON HIS REPLACEMENT SCORED TRY 
HE IS A SOLID PERFORMER TRY BISHOP ON THIS OCCASION AN INSIDE 
BALL THERE HE IS COMING FROM DEEP 
IT SHOULD BE AN EASY TACKLE FOR 
CHUTER OR GOODE 
IT IS A TACKLE THAT HAS TO BE MADE 
HE DRIVES THROUGH A VERY GOOD 
FINISH 
WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT FINISH TOO SAVE MY MAN 
IF THE STEPS AND 
YOU'RE INSIDE IT IS NORMALLY THE 
INSIDE ANDY GOODE NEEDS TO MAKE 
THE BETTER IT SOLID TACKLE HE WAS 
LIKE A TURNSTILE WITH HIS ARM OUT 
HE WILL NOT BE HAPPY WITH THE 
TACKLE 
HE SHOULD NOT HAVE GOT TO TACKLE THE LINE WHEN SEE GOT THE TACKLE A A VERY GOOD FINISHER 
THE TRY AND 
CHANGE THE MOMENTUM OF THE HALF 
AFTER THAT IT WAS ALL THE OSPREYS 
I THOUGHT LEE BYRNE 
WAS QUICK L. WAS SURPRISED HE GOT CAUGHT WHAT WHAT YOU CANNOT SEE IS IT LOOKS AS IF HE 
IS A THREE BUT IN FRONT OF HARRY 
ELLIS IS ANDY GOODE BURNS WITH AN 
EXCELLENT FIRST 
EVERYTHING ASKED OF A BYRNE HE HAS 
DEVELOPED DELIVERED 
I WAS 
CRITICAL OF THEM AT THE START OF 
THE SEASON HE WAS PONDEROUS WITH 
NO CONVICTION HE LEFT THE BALL 
BOUNCE ON THE FLOOR AS A FULLBACK 
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE BALL AND 
DOMINATE HE HAS BEEN SUPERB HE IS 
ONE OF THE STAR PLAYERS FOR WALES 
THIS YEAR 
TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE SHANE 
WILLIAMS TOUCHED THE BALL WHICH 
GAVE AN INDICATION OF WHAT KIND OF 
GAME IT WAS IN THE LAST TEN MINUTES 
HE GOT A COUPLE OF TIMES YOU FEEL 
THEY WILL PLAY TO THE OSPREYS HANDS 
HE COMES LOOKING FOR BALLS HE IS 
ON THE TOP OF HIS GAME WHEN YOU 
ARE IN RICH VEIN OF FORM YOU WON 
THE BALL IN YOUR HANDS WITH WITH LEICESTER DRIFT DEFENCE HE IS MORE 
DANGEROUS WE SAW FROM A TURNOVER 
KICK WHERE GIOVANNI WAS THERE 
LEICESTER ARE DOMINATING THE SCRUM 
BECAUSE THEY LOST LAST WEEK AND 
MADE FEW CHANGES BENNETT IS NOT 
PLAYING DUNCAN JAMES IAN GOUGH 
MAYBE NOW THEY'LL BE TIME TO SAY 
LET'S GET ON AND GET THE BASED 
STRONG IF THEY GET THAT RIGHT THE 
LINE OUT HAS BEEN GREAT FOR THEM 
THEY ARE IN FRONT AND HAVE NOT 
PLAYED THAT WELL 
FOR BOTH TEAMS 
THIS HAS BECOME A BIGGER GAME THAN 
YOU MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED BECAUSE 
THEY BOTH NEED TO WIN IT TOOK 
GUARANTEE A TROPHY CAN THE OSPREYS 
PLAY A CONTAINING PRAGMATIC GAME 
ORDER THEY HAVE TO THROW IT OPEN 
THEY CAN AGAINST IRELAND AND 
IRELAND THEY CLOSE THE GAME DOWN 
THEY ARE CAPABLE OF DOING IT WHEN 
THE TIME IS RIGHT THEY WOULD DO 
THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO YET THEY 
HAVE TO PLAY IN THE RIGHT AREAS 
GET A GOOD KICK GAME GOING AT THE 
MOMENT THEY HAVE GOT TO PLAY THE 
WAY THEY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH HIS HIS ANDY GOODE INJURED 
I THINK SO 
LEICESTER LOOKED TO BE LACKING 
INVENTION THINGS IN THE SEMI FINAL 
CHIPS IN BEHIND THEY ARE NOT GOING 
THEIR WAY THEY HAVEN'T MOVED AWAY 
FROM DROPPING BALLS TO THE INSIDE 
BREAKING TACKLES AND OFFLOADING AND 
BREAKING THROUGH 
IT IS NEGATIVE 
BECAUSE I FEEL THEY HAVE VARNDELL 
THEY ARE OUTGUNNED BY THE OSPREYS 
BACK LINE WITH SHAME THEY ARE A 
BIT PONDEROUS THERE IS NEGATIVE TO 
THERE 
A LOVELY SUNNY DAY THERE GLOUCESTER ARE PLAYING SARACENS 
THE WEATHER WILL BE OF NO INTEREST 
IN THE SWIMMING CHAMPIONSHIPS THE 
MASTERS THIRD ROUND TIGER IS HERE 
AND THE MARATHON TOMORROW MANY 
WATCHING US THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE 
TAKING PART IN THAT MANY THOUSANDS 
AT TWICKENHAM THIS AFTERNOON HE 
WILL BE RUNNING L. HAD AN E. MAIL 
FROM A YOUNG MAN COLIN PARTRIDGE 
WHO HAS NOT SHOWN FOR FIVE MONTHS 
IF DURING THE DAY ARE CAMERAS FOCUS 
ON THE SUMMER WITH AN UNBELIEVABLY 
STUPID BIT COLIN IS RUNNING THE 
MARATHON FORCE BOX GOOD LUCK TO 
HIM AND EVERYONE ELSE FORCED 
BARKS 
HER THANK YOU WE 
STARTED IN A DOWNPOUR AND NOW IT IS 
TIME TO START IN GLORIOUS SUNSHINE THERE WAS SOME SHENANIGANS ON THE TACKLE ON JUNE LANEY RYAN JAMES PICKED UP BAD PASS THEIR TO BEN HERRING GOOD WORK BY THE OSPREYS SCRUM HALF SCRAPPY OLD BREAKDOWN AREA IT COULD BE ON IF RYAN JAMES SPOTS IT HAS GONE LOOSE AGAIN FOR THE 
OSPREYS LACK OF CONTROL AT THE 
BACK OF THE RUCK THIS HAS BEEN VERY PONDEROUS BY 
LEICESTER THEY HAD A GOLDEN 
OPPORTUNITY WITH NUMBERS AND THEY 
LOST FIFTEEN YARDS 
THEY COULD NOT GET THE BALL QUICKEN 
UP AND THEN WENT THE WRONG WAY FOR A SECOND THERE WAS EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THERE THE BALL DIDN'T COME LESS HEIGHT MORE DISTANCE THIS 
TIME BETTER RESULT TOO HE WAS 
FORTUNATE WITH THE BOUNCE BECAUSE 
YOU CANNOT CONTROL THEIR EYES HE 
PUT IT IN THE AREA WHERE THAT MIGHT 
OCCUR WE WERE DISCUSSING THE LATERAL RUN 
IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL IT DRAWS 
PEOPLE TO HIM AND LEAVES GAPS IN 
BETWEEN IT WAS ALUN WYN JONES WHO JUST THE FIRST PENALTY AGAINST HER LAUGH LEICESTER WILL HAVE THIS LINE OUT 
GEORGE CHUTER TO THROW OLLIE SMITH 
HAS LEFT HIS WING AND IS STANDING 
BEHIND ANDY GOODE MURPHY RIGHT ON THE TOUCH LINE IT 
WILL NOT WORK IF YOU GET THE BALL 
LIKE THAT ELLIS HAS A CHANCE TO FEED THE THREE QUARTERS THE OSPREYS GET A PENALTY THE PASS STOP EVERYTHING DEAD DIDN'T IT IT SLIPPED BUT YOU CANNOT DO THAT WAS THAT HIGH NOT REALLY IN HIS DAY AARON MAUGER WAS A PLAYMAKER FOR THE ALL BLACKS GOOD WERE WORD LEE BYRNE THE OSPREYS EXPLOITING A HAPHAZARD 
DEFENCE FROM LEICESTER THEY COULD 
NOT GROUP QUICKLY ENOUGH IT WAS AN 
IMPORTANT SWITCH BEFORE THERE HE DECIDES NOT TO GO ON THE OPEN 
SIDE HE COMES BACK AND TURNS BACK 
ON HIMSELF L. DO NOT KNOW WHETHER 
THERE WAS INSTINCTIVE BUT THAT IS 
WHERE THE OSPREYS WERE STRONG 
LEICESTER WERE WEEK THEY HAVE MADE 
THEM PAY SECOND TRY TO THE OSPREYS SECOND CONVERSION WOULD JAMES LOOK ALTHOUGH OSPREYS HAVE LOOKED MORE 
DANGEROUS IN OPEN PLAY THE BASIS 
OF THEIR SUPERIORITY FROM ABOUT FIFTEEN 
OR TWENTY AFTER THE KICK OFF WAS THEY 
HAVE STOPPED THE LEICESTER FORWARDS 
GETTING MOMENTUM GREAT KICK FIVE POINTS IS TURNED 
INTO SEVEN AND EARLY DAYS TO SIX TO 
THIRTEEN SIX TO FOURTEEN WELL THEY GOT THEMSELVES OUT OF A 
BUT THAT WAS NOT PRETTY THAT IS 
THE LACK OF CONTROL AT THE 
BREAKDOWN AREA FOR OSPREYS THE 
BALL IS SPRAYING OUT NOBODY IS 
THERE TO PUT A FOOT ON IT DUE LARGELY HAS SEEN VERY LITTLE THE BOUNCE WAS GOOD MARTIN CORRY NOW HAS A SECOND CHANCE THE OSPREYS GET THE PENALTY THAT IS ALL FROM FILO TIATIA TACKLE YOU CANNOT BLAME DEACON THERE JAMES AND FILO TIATIA LEICESTER 
HAVE GOT TO GET SOMEONE ON TO THE 
FORWARD DRIVES WHITE COMES ON HE WILL GIVE SOME 
HEAVY WEIGHT TO THE SCRUMMAGE 
STANKOVICH GOES OFF THAT IS A WASTE FOR THE OSPREYS APART FROM THAT RICHARD HIBBARD 
HAS HAD A GOOD GAME HIS THROWS 
HAVE BEEN GOOD I AM TRYING TO WORK OUT WHAT HIPKISS IS DOING SHANE WILLIAMS A GOOD PAIR OF HANDS OVER HIS SHOULDER THIS IS THE SORT OF AREAS OSPREYS LIKE PLENTY OF SPACE ON BOTH SIDES OSPREYS FERRYING IT NICELY THE 
WIDTH AND THE DRIVE IN MIDFIELD 
VARYING IT NICELY IT IS A LINE OUT THE MORE 
INVENTIVE PLAY AND MORE DANGEROUS 
PLAYERS COMING FROM THE OSPREYS WHO 
ARE PREPARED TO TAKE CHANCES TWO 
PLAYERS HERE WILLIAMS AND BURN 
SUPREMELY CONFIDENT AT THE MOMENT 
EVEN THOUGH HE IS UNDER PRESSURE 
IT DID NOT MATTER 
THE WHISTLE WENT 
BEFORE LEICESTER STORE THE LINEOUT 
HE IS HAVING A WORD WITH CORRY NOT NOT SHORT OF ADVICE ABOUT THIS FOR BOTH 
PACKS THAT IS SO NOT STRAIGHT AGAIN IT IS A SCRAP TO GET THAT BALL AWAY LEICESTER MAY HAVE TURNED IT A 
PENALTY COME OFF SAID THEY THINK 
OF SIDE I THINK OFFSIDE 
THERE 
THERE IS A REPETITIVE SHOT BY THE OSPREYS 
WHICH IS ALLUDING LEICESTER 
COMPLETELY THERE IS A SILENCE 
THEY'RE NOT WHEN THEY'RE ON SONG 
HE CARRIES ON GOING BECAUSE HE HAS 
GOT TACKLED IT IS ONLY FIVE L. DO 
NOT SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT 
IT WAS NOT HIM THAT IS FOR SURE 
THERE WAS A RUCK THERE WAS NO 
TACKLE 
I THINK HE SAID IT WAS TACKLE SOMETHING HE WAS ABOUT TO PENALISE 
FOR BEFORE HE CAME IN 
ENOUGH 
FAIR ENOUGH 
HIS OTHER KICKS HAVE 
BEEN AS TRICKY AS THIS THIS IS 
NUMBER FIVE THAT IS ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL KICK HE 
LANDED THE CONVERSION FROM THERE 
HE HAS JUST PICKED OVER THE PENALTY 
AS WELL BOOT OF HER 
JAMES HOOK 
SINCE HE CAME ON TO THE CIRCUIT HAS 
NEVER LOOKED LESS THAN CONFIDENT 
HE IS GAINING A TOUR DITTY IN 
ALMOST EVERY GAME NOT QUITE THE 
COMPLETE PLAYER MATURITY HE IS 
ONE HELL OF A PLAY A PLAYER CROFT HAS COME ON WHEN THEY DO MANAGE TO GET THE BALL 
IT FILLS SPELLS 
THE OTHERS THEN 
THE WITH VAN THEY WILL NOT BE IN 
THERE IT MEANS THAT IF THE OSPREYS 
WANT TO KEEP LONG YEARS BIG BUT IS 
NOT GOING TO GO THE LINE AT THE 
MOMENT THEY ARE CONTENT TO KEEP THE 
BALL AND POLICE BALL IN PLACE MURPHY HAS BEEN STRONG ON THE COUNTER ATTACK CLUMSY BY LEICESTER PERHAPS THAT 
IS THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN THE 
BALL GOES OUT OF PLAY 
THEY HAVE 
BEEN A COUPLE OF PASSES ABDUCTED IF 
WE ARE OFF AGAIN OF WILL THAT LOOKED DANGEROUS THEY 
SHOULD HAVE KEPT THAT IN HAND 
ALTHOUGH THE CAN PICKS UP THE CAN DEACON DEACON NO ONE AT ALL ON THE BLIND DEACON SIDE 
THE OSPREYS WOULD HAVE LIKED SIDE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE FROM THAT 
I CANNOT BELIEVE LEICESTER HAVE PUT 
SO MUCH FOR ALL TO PLAY A STANDING 
STILL PLAYERS 
HE WAS FELT THERE 
BY THE TACKLE THAT COMES IN BECAUSE 
IT STOPS HIS MOMENTUM AND HE WAS 
ABLE TO PASS HELPED EVIDENCE ALL 
OVER THE FIELD FOR THEIR SPACE 
THE OSPREYS 
IF HE HAS TO GO OFF 
LEICESTER WILL BE LOSING THE ONLY 
BAKU HAS BEEN OF USE THIS AFTERNOON 
BACK WHO 
THAT DID 
NOT QUITE WORK THAT IS NOT A TACKLE THAT IS A CHEAP SHOT 
A GIVE ME A DEFINITION OF THE 
TACKLE 
MURPHY HAS TO BE IN TACKLE POSSESSION OF IT IS START WITH BUT 
TIATIA IS JUST ARRIVING HE IS NOT 
GOING TO STOP BECAUSE SOMEBODY IS 
IN HIS WAY 
O. K. FINE 
IT WAS NOT A 
TACKLE BECAUSE HE DID NOT USE ANY 
OF HIS ARMS BUT IT WAS CONTACT 
COME ON 
YOU COULD DO THAT TO 
ANYONE THEN O. K. 
HE IS ALL RIGHT O. K. THAT IS THE MAIN THING 
MURPHY HAS 
PLAYED WELL HE IS VERY STRONG 
BOTH SIDES WIDE OPEN A GOLDEN 
POSITION AS LONG AS THE SCRUM HOLDS 
UP IT HAS IT IS A STUTTERING START NOW THERE IS MOTION ANDY GOODE TRIES TO GO ON HIS OWN WEST TO HAVE TURNED A DANGEROUS 
DEFENSIVE SCRUM INTO THIS BREAKDOWN 
SITUATION LEICESTER SLOW BALL AND GETTING SLOWER THAT IS 
THE STRENGTH OF HIPKISS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN THAT TODAY OF SAID HE GET AWAY WITH THAT ONE 
SO SLOW IS CROFT WINNING NUMBER NINETEEN WEARING LEICESTER'S GAY PUT BACK BUT IT IS 
SLOW AGAIN FOR BEN KAY SCRAPE IT 
BACK PENALTY ADVANTAGE TO LEICESTER 
CROFT HAS ONE HAND ON IT 
TO LEICESTER 
I THINK THEY HAVE TO 
KICK FOR TOUCH EROTICA SCRUM 
BECAUSE THE POINTS OR TAKE A 
SCRUM 
AND HE HAS HAD ITS DEBT AND NO 
OPTIONS FROM THE CENTRE WATCHED 
HIM 
FORWARDS HANGING ABOUT IN THE 
MIDFIELD 
THE OTHER THING IS THE MIDFIELD BALL WAS COMING OUT SO SOLID ANDY 
GOODE SO SLOWLY TO ANDY GOODE BACK ROW RESTARTED A FEW MOMENTS 
AGO BACK WHERE WE STARTED HE HE HAS MADE HIS OWN DECISION I HE IS 
NOT GOING TO THEIR TELEVISION MATCH 
OFFICIAL HE WAS IN THE RIGHT 
POSITION GOOD REFEREEING COME AND 
HE HAS BEEN DECISIVE 
HE WILL BE WELL AWARE THAT 
LEICESTER NEED TO SCORE A TRY HERE 
BENNETT COMES ON HIBBARD HAS HAD 
GOOD GAME 
YES HOW OLD 
IS HE HE HE IS SLIGHTLY OLDER THAN YOU WOULD 
THINK TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE IN JUNE ANCIENT ANCIENT HE ANCIENT HE IS NOT A NEWCOMER HE HAS BEEN 
AROUND FOR A COUPLE OF SEASONS BUT 
HE IS GROWING IN STATURE 
I WONDER 
IF LEICESTER WILL GO FOR THIS AGAIN 
THEY ARE GOING 
A BIT OF CHIT CHAT 
GOING ON THERE IT IS ALWAYS INTERESTING HOW THEY 
REFEREES REFEREE THE DRIVES FOR IT 
LEICESTER WILL NOT BE MOVING THAT 
SCRUM AROUND BECAUSE THEY WANT A 
STEADY PLATFORM 
IF THEY DID WANT 
TO MOVE IT WOULD BE IN THAT 
DIRECTION I THINK THAT WAS JULIAN WHITE 
DECIDING IT WAS NOT IDEAL SO HE 
WOULD GO DOWN IT IS VERY DIFFICULT 
FOR REFEREES I UNDERSTAND THAT 
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT PEOPLE 
WERE TRYING TO DO WEST THERE ARE 
TRYING TO GET SET BOLSOVER CAN 
STAND OVER THE LINE LEICESTER 
STEADY BALLS WE HAVE AN INJURY 
CASTROGIOVANNI YES 
HE PLAYS IN 
ITALY LEAD WAS A GREAT ACCOLADE TO 
BECOME THE PREMIERSHIP PLAYER OF 
THE YEAR LAST YEAR AFTER ARRIVING 
IN ENGLAND IT IS NEVER EASY TO 
COME FROM OVERSEAS AND MAKE YOUR 
MARK 
ALSO WHERE HE PLAYS AS WELL MARK IT IS NOT EXACTLY A GLAMOUR 
POSITION WHETHER THAT IS CAMP 
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE WILL NOT BE 
RUNNING THE MARATHON TOMORROW 
CRAMP LEICESTER KNOCKED IT ON FIRST THE 
OSPREYS WILL HAVE THEIR PICK OF THE 
SCRUM 
THAT IS POOR FROM LEICESTER SCRUM A QUICK WORD FROM AUSTEN 
IF YOU 
LOOK AT THE CLOCK SIXTY THREE MINUTES 
LEICESTER GIVEN A PENALTY INSTEAD 
OF GOING FOR THE LINEOUT THE WASTED 
SIX MINUTES IN SCRUMS SCRUMS A 
VERY DIFFICULT TOCOHEN AFTER THE 
COLLAPSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO SCORE 
FROM THEM IT IS NOT THE REAL 
LEICESTER ARE GOING TO WIN THIS 
GAME 
IN THE SIX NATIONS THERE WERE GAME MORE TRIES SCORED FROM SCRUMS THAN 
FROM LINEOUT WHICH BUCKS THE TREND 
EON GOLF IS ON IAN GOUGH THIS IS OFF SIDE THAT WAS HORRIBLE 
SUCH A GOOD PLAYER IT ALWAYS 
SEEMED IT WAS GOING TO BE A MISHAP 
THESE ARE PROFESSIONAL PLAYERS 
THEY WELL KNOW THE MAN COMING FROM 
BEHIND THE MAN IS FURTHEST BACK AS 
THE COST OF THE BALL THE MAN 
BEHIND HAS PRECEDENCE TO BE FAIR 
THERE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN APPALLED 
BUT IF THERE WASN'T THEM BETWEEN 
THE TWO OF THEM IT WAS MESS IT IS OUT HE IS LUCKY COME OTHER 
CARS THAT BALL WAS JUST OUT OF THE 
RUCK BECAUSE 
YES ONE OF THE 
THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
INTRODUCED IS THERE WHEN THE BALL 
IS IN THAT POSITION THERE PER 
REFEREE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY 
THAT YOU HAVE FIVE SECONDS TO PLAY 
IT BECAUSE IT IS EFFECTIVELY AT 
DEAD OF BED THE BALL DEAD 
BALL 
IT IS OUT 
THAT MEANS THE BALL REFEREE DOES NOT CONSIDER IT TO BE 
OUT AND I THINK IT WAS OUT I I THINK IT WAS UNLUCKY THERE 
CORRY CORRY JAMES IS OFF STANKOVICH IS COMING 
BACK ON FOR LEICESTER WHITE IS 
STILL ON PRESUMABLY CASTROGIOVANNI 
MUST HAVE GONE OFF 
YES HE HAS 
HOLDING HIS HAMSTRING IF THIS GOES 
OVER IT EFFECTIVELY SEALS THE GAME 
IT WOULD BE THE WRONG SORT OF ISSUE 
TO SETTLE THE GAME ON BUT I CANNOT 
SEE LEICESTER SCORING THEY HAVE 
HAD OPPORTUNITIES BUT THEY CANNOT 
SEE THEM SCORING THREE TIMES I 
CANNOT JAMES HOOK PLANS A PEACH OF A KICK 
LANDS 
YOU COULD SAY JUSTIFIABLY 
LANDS THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 
TEAMS HAS BEEN THE CREATIVITY OF 
THE OSPREYS BACK BUT JUST AS MUCH 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS IS THE WAY 
THEY HAVE DEFENDED 
WHAT A GOOD 
GAME LEAD BYRNE HAS HAD HE DOES NOT NEED TO DO ANYTHING ELSE 
VAUGHTON AGAINST MURPHY ELSE HE ELSE HE HAS BEEN LESS THAN'S BEST PLAYER 
LEICESTER THE OSPREYS HAVE NOT LET LEICESTER GET ANY MEANT MOMENTUM IT LOOKS AS AFFAIR REIN IS GOING TO 
FOLLOW ON THE END OF THE GAME 
THE RAIN 
THEY ARE SCREAMING ABOUT 
THIS HE SLIPS AS HE GOES DOWN L. 
DO NOT BLAME THE OSPREYS PLAYER 
THEIR HE WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT IN 
THE MIDRIFF IF HE HAD NOT BEEN 
GOING DOWN THE RESULT FAR HIPKISS 
WAS THAT HE GOT A WHACK ON THE JOB 
JAW 
I THINK WE WILL HAVE A BREAK 
HERE BECAUSE THEY WILL TAKE THEIR 
TIME PUTTING HIPKISS ON A STRETCHER 
THEY ALWAYS TAKE GREAT CARE WITH 
HEAD AND NECK INJURIES IN SOME 
WAYS THERE IS MORE TROUBLE FOR 
LEICESTER IS SOMEBODY DOWN ON THE 
LEFT HAND SIDE THIS GAME IS TAKING 
ITS TOLL ON THE LEICESTER PLAYERS 
THEY HAVE THE BATTLE FOR PLAY OFFS 
WE HAVE STANKOVICH TOM BALMER DEAL 
COMES ON AS WELL VARNDELL THERE 
IS STANKOVICH BACK ON HIS FEET 
CHARGE SHOULD TO HAS GONE OFF 
GEORGE CHUTER THIS IS HIPKISS WHO 
WENT DOWN 
IN FIVE MINUTES HE IS 
NOT GOING TO BE INFLUENCING THEIR 
GAME AT ALL THANKFULLY HIPKISS IS 
ALL RIGHT AFTER THAT ACCIDENT 
STANKOVICH COMES OFF AGAIN WHO IS 
IN THE FRONT ROW GEORGE CHUTER 
WEIGHT IS STILL THERE WHITE 
JAMES HOOK HAS ANOTHER SHOT AT GOAL 
THIS WOULD STOP THE GAME COLD BED 
WHAT WAS THE PENALTY FOR DO YOU 
REMEMBER 
I DON'T THINK I'D DO I REMEMBER DO THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES HAVE NOT BEEN 
THAT ENTHRALLING IF YOU'RE AN 
OSPREYS FAN YOU HAVE TO MARVEL AT 
THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE PUT 
LEICESTER UNDER SO MUCH PRESSURE 
FIVE SUCCESSFUL KICKS FOR JAMES 
HOOK MORE CHANGES FOR THE OSPREYS 
BISHOP GOES OFF NOT GOOD KICKING SKILLS HE USED TO 
PLAY GOALKEEPER FOR A PISTOL ROLE 
ROVERS 
THAT IS WHY HE WAS NOT AN ROVERS OUT PLAYER OBVIOUSLY 
BRISTOL 
ROVERS THERE WILL BE A SCRUM THERE HAVE 
BEEN RUMBLINGS ABOUT LESSER ABOUT 
THE ATTACKING THREAT THEY POSE AND 
THE CAMP IS NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY 
LEICESTER BECAUSE SHE DID SO WELL 
WITH ARGENTINA MAYBE IT IS TAKING 
HIM TIME TO SETTLE COACH THEY 
HAVE BEEN TO VOTE DEVOID OF TEETH 
TODAY 
YES THEY HAVE BUT CREDIT TODAY TO THE OSPREYS THEY HAVE NOT 
ALLOWED THEM TO GET OVER THE GAME 
AT ALL STILL IT IS SIMPLE IT IS FORWARD THE 
REFEREE AWARDS A SCRUM 
SHOULD HAVE 
SCORED THAT DEFINITELY A PLAYER 
OF SHANE WILLIAMS EXPERIENCE AND 
ABILITY HE SHOULD HAVE GONE WAY 
BEFORE THEN YOU CANNOT SEE FROM 
THAT ANGLE IT WAS FORWARD IT WAS 
GIVEN UNCONTESTED SCRUM WHICH 
MEANS YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO PUSH IN 
EITHER DIRECTION THEY ARE STARTING TO SHOW BOAT THE OSPREYS IT IS NOW COMING DOWN WITH HALE MAN OF THE MATCH I WISH I COULD 
GIVE ITS AT ALL OF THE OSPREYS 
BACKS MARTIN HORROR HIS MAN THE I WISH I COULD GIVE IT TO THE THREE 
OF THEM THEY HAVE WORKED WELL 
TODAY COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER WELL 
IN RELATION TO IT RYAN JONES 
PLAYING FANTASTIC IT WOULD BE IRONIC IF THE VARNDELL WHEN THE LENGTH OF THE FIELD WE WILL HAVE WON LAST LINE OUT THERE IS VARNDELL BENNETT'S IS A REPLACEMENT HIMSELF IT IS ALL OVER THE OSPREYS HAVE 
SOME SILVERWARE KNOCKED OUT THE 
HEINEKEN CUP LAST WEEK WHAT A 
CHANGE OF THIS WEEK THEY ARE THE 
CHAMPIONS IT COMES WITH PLACE IN 
EUROPE GUARANTEED THEY WOULD 
PROBABLY BE THERE ANYWAY SOMETHING 
THAT BRINGS GREAT RELIEF TO LYN 
JONES IN THE END IT WAS 
CONVINCING THERE IS A LYN JONES 
THE COACH AND THE PLAYERS HAVE DONE 
HIM PROUD THEY RESPONDED TO DEFEAT 
LAST WEEK AND HAVE DEFEATED THE 
LEICESTER TIGERS A REVERSE OF LAST 
YEAR'S FINAL THIS YEAR THE 
OSPREYS ARE THE CHAMPIONS 
TEN WEEKS AFTER THE OSPREY PLAYERS 
CAME HERE AS IN RED JERSEYS THEY 
RETURNED TO BEAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
NAMES IN THE ENGLISH GAME 
LEICESTER TIGERS AN INCREDIBLY A 
SOGGY END TO THE GAME RYAN JONES 
I BET YOU DO NOT CARE I DO NOT 
REALLY CARE YOU ARE RIGHT A 
FANTASTIC OCCASION L. THINK WE HAVE 
THEIR REWARD WE HAVE DESERVED 
THERE WERE TWENTY TWO HEROES UP THERE TO 
THERE 
AFTER THE EXIT FROM THE THERE HEINEKEN CUP DID YOU FEEL YOU HAD 
TO COME OUT HERE AND RE ESTABLISH 
THE OSPREYS AND PROVE A POINT YEAH YEAH WE WERE DISAPPOINTED LAST WEEK 
WHITTAKER TOM BOARD AND HAVE WORKED 
HARD I AM PROUD WE HAVE TURNED IT 
AROUND 
WHOLE ARE YOU ARE THE MAN AROUND OF THE MATCH HOW TOUGH OR WAS IT 
AGAINST TIGERS 
A VERY TOUGH L. AM 
NOT SURE ABOUT MAN OF THE MATCH IT 
WAS A TEAM EFFORT MASSIVE CREDIT 
TO OUR FRONT FIVE AND EIGHT THEY 
TOOK A FEW KNOCKS L. THOUGHT WE 
DOMINATED UP FRONT 
HOW MUCH SOUL 
SEARCHING HAS THERE BEEN IN THE 
SQUAD AFTER THE SARACENS RESULT IT IT WAS A TOUGH TO PICK OURSELVES UP 
BY TUESDAY NIGHT WE WERE REFOCUSED 
AND ON A HIGH 
I SAW LYN JONES 
YOUR COACH RUNNING UP THE STAIRS 
LIKE A SCHOOLBOY HOW MUCH DO YOU 
OWE THE PERFORMANCE OF TO HIM I I THINK HIM AND THE MANAGEMENT IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTING TO 
COME AWAY WITH A SILVERWARE THIS 
IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN SHOW WE DID 
LET OURSELVES DOWN LAST WEEK AND 
DESERVE TO GET THROUGH TO A SEMI 
FINAL ON THE HEINEKEN CUP 
CONGRATULATIONS 
WELL RYAN JONES WAS NOT HANGING 
AROUND 
BACK IN THE ASCENDANCY OF THE 
OSPREYS PLAYED WELL BUT LEICESTER 
WERE POOR 
VERY POOR ONE 
DIMENSIONAL THEY STARTED IN THE 
RAIN THE RAIN STOPPED AND THEY 
DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE 
STRATEGY ULTIMATELY THAT WAS 
THEIR DOWNFALL CALL DO NOT TAKE 
ANYTHING FROM THE OSPREYS A GOOD 
PERFORMANCE FROM INDIVIDUALS IN THE 
BACK HOOK LEE BYRNE 
THEY HAD NO 
ANSWERS TO THE OSPREYS DEFENCE 
LEICESTER NEVER QUESTIONED THE 
OSPREYS DEFENCE AND FOR THE LAST 
HOUR CLEARLY ONLY ONE WINNER AND 
DESERVEDLY SO 
SIXTY SIX THOUSAND HERE AT 
TWICKENHAM A TERRIFIC CROWD THE 
FIRST FIFTEEN MINUTES OF THE SECOND HALF 
WE THOUGHT WE COULD BE ON FOR A 
GOOD SECOND HALF BUT IF ONE TEAM 
DOES NOT PLAY AND LEICESTER DIDN'T 
PLAY YOU GET NO SPECTACLE WHY WHY DIDN'T THEY PLAY WE HAVE WATCHED 
LEICESTER THROUGH THE YEARS WHEN 
AUSTIN WAS PLAIN VARNDELL IS THERE 
MAUGER CLUELESS THOUGH ABSOLUTELY 
CLUELESS TODAY WHEN YOU HAVE 
SOMEONE OF THAT CLASS OF IT MAUGER 
AT TWELVE YOU HAVE THAT THE THINK WHAT 
ARE THEY DOING ON THE TRAINING 
SHOULD WE HAVE A RED INTO THAT'S 
SELECTION OUGHT NON SELECTION HOW 
LEICESTER WERE APPROACHING THE 
GAME 
SUCH A NEGATIVE DECISION THE GAME THE COACHING STAFF NEED TO SIT DOWN AND 
REASSESS WHERE THEY'RE GOING YOU 
PICK VARNDELL TO WIN GAMES FOR YOU 
WITH MAUGER HE HAS BEEN CARRYING 
INJURY FOR TWO OR THREE WEEKS THEY 
SELECTED HIM FOR THERE GAME WAS HE 
PRESSURE RIGHT REALISTICALLY 
LEICESTER APART FROM THE WASPS 
GAME IN THE SEMI FINAL WHERE ONE 
ARE TWO PLAYERS SHONE THEY HAVE 
TAKEN A HUGE BACKWARDS STEP IN IN THAT THE TIMES A DEAL IS ALL BUT 
DONE WITH HERNANDEZ TO PLAY FOR 
LEICESTER TIGERS WELL THAT ADDS AN 
EXTRA DIMENSION YOU HAVE TO CHANGE 
THE LOSS OF IT 
IF YOU HAVE 
HERNANDEZ PLAY ONE OF THE BEST 
BACKS YOU DO KNOW WHAT YOUR 
FORWARDS CONGREGATING AROUND THE 
BALL AND SLOWING IT DOWN YOU PICK 
THEM UP THE BACKSIDE TO MAKE SURE 
THEY DO AT IT AGAIN 
MARTIN CORRY 
A GREAT SERVANT OF LEICESTER TIGERS 
LEADING THE TEAM UP TO RECEIVE THE 
RUNNERS UP MEDALS HIPKISS IS IN 
ONE PIECE IT LOOKED WHEN HE TOOK 
IT WAS A SWINGING ARM BUT 
INADVERTENT FROM ALUN WYN JONES IT 
LOOKED AS IF HE MIGHT BE VERY 
SERIOUSLY INJURED SOME OF FAMOUS 
FACES CASTROGIOVANNI THEY'LL BE 
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PERFORMANCE 
YOU COULD SAY ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF 
HOW WELSH RUGBY HAS MOVED FORWARD 
IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS 
THEY WILL BE 
BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED WITH LAST 
WEEK'S EFFORTS AGAINST SARACENS 
BUT IS THE PRIZE THEY WOULD LIKE 
TO KEEP GOING TODAY BY TUESDAY 
THEY WERE FOCUSED COME UP FOR THE 
GAME THEY ARE UP THERE THEY NEED 
THE LEVEL OF CONSISTENCY WHICH 
LEICESTER HAVE HAD OVER THE LAST 
DECADE THE OSPREYS ARE GOING THE 
RIGHT DIRECTION AND THEY ARE THE 
BEST TEAM IN WALES AT THE MOMENT 
THEY ARE DRAGGING THE OTHER REGIONS 
WITH THE CARDIFF WERE IN THE SEMI 
FINAL AGAINST TOULOUSE 
JAMES COOKE 
HOOK HE IS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED 
AS IF YOU'RE PICKING A LIONS 
TEAM NOW HE WOULD BE THERE HE HE DIDN'T PLAY A LOT OF RUGBY 
QUESTION MARKS OVER HIS GAME 
MANAGEMENT BUT TODAY HE ANSWERED 
THAT HE PUT THE BALL IN THE RIGHT 
AREAS TO CLOSE THE GAME OFF LEAVE 
LEICESTER HE HAS HAD A GOOD SEASON 
JONES BACK FROM INJURY HAS BEEN 
IMMENSE LEE BYRNE HALF TIME ALSO 
GAVIN HENSON THEY DIDN'T MISS HIM 
TODAY BUT HE PLAYED A BIG ROLE IN 
WALES'S SUCCESS THIS YEAR HE 
KICKED WHEN HE HAD TO AND THEY 
HAVE GENIUS THERE 
THE MAJORITY OF 
THOSE PLAYERS IF THEY CAN HANG ON 
TO THREE YEARS UNTIL THE WORLD CUP 
IT IS A BIG ASS 
THEY'RE NOT THAT 
OLD 
THERE IS THE MOMENT FOUR JONES OLD A FANTASTIC PICTURE FOR THE FAMILY 
SCRAPBOOK AFTER ALL THE EVENTS FOR 
WALES WINNERS OF THE U. D. F. TROPHY 
E. D. S. E. D. F. ENERGY 
I THINK E. D. F. ENERGY ARE PLEASED IT 
HAS BEEN AN EXTREMELY GOOD 
COMPETITION FROM START TO FINISH 
WHEN IN SEPTEMBER THEY THOUGHT ONLY 
SECOND SCENES MIGHT BE PUT IN IT 
HAS NOT BEEN A WAVE THEY HAD BEEN 
REPAID AND THE CROWD OF SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND ONE OF LEADER THERE 
VERY SPORTING OF YOU TO APPLAUD THE 
OSPREYS WERE NO UP THERE YOU'RE 
BEATEN BY THE BETTER TEAM TODAY AS AS MUCH AS IT PAINS ME TO SAY BUT IS 
RIGHT THEY OUTPLAYED US TODAY WE 
UNDERPERFORM THAT IS THE HARDEST 
THING YOU WANT TO PUT TUNNEL BEST 
SHOW AND WE DIDN'T 
WHY WERE LESS 
THE SO FLAT MARTIN 
WE COULD NOT 
GET INTO THE GAME WE COULD NOT GET 
THE BALL CREDIT TO OSPREYS DEFENCE 
WE HAD CHANCES AND THEY CLOSED US 
DOWN I'LL GAME COULD NOT FUNCTION 
IT WAS NOT THROUGH LACK OF EFFORT 
A LACK OF APPLICATION 
WHEN YOU 
LOOK AT THE TEAM SHEET DID YOU 
SEND UP THE WRONG MESSAGE OLLIE 
SMITH ON THE WING 
NO NOT AT ALL 
I DISAGREE INVESTOR WE HAVE A 
COMPETITIVE SQUAD AT LEICESTER 
WE HAVE A COMPETITIVE SQUAD WE 
WENT OUT TO WIN THIS GAME IT 
DIDN'T HAPPEN YOU CAN LOOK FOR ALL 
THE EXCUSES YOU LIKE BUT THE FIFTEEN ON 
THE FIELD DIDN'T TAKE THE CHANCES 
THERE IS A NEW COACHING SET UP IS 
IT TAKING TIME TO ADJUST 
WE HAVE 
LOST A CUP FINAL AT TWICKENHAM AND 
SO ANYONE CAN LOOK FOR EXCUSES WE 
ARE NOT POINTING FINGERS AND SAY 
ANYTHING THEY'RE ALL FIFTEEN PLAYERS ON 
THE FIELD TODAY THEY WERE MORE THAN 
CAPABLE OF WINNING THE GAME WE 
DIDN'T THE BUCK STOPS WITH THE 
PLAYERS 
WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE LESS PLAYERS THE'S SEIZING YOU ARE NOT 
GUARANTEED A TOP FINISH IN THE 
PREMIERSHIP SEASON 
WE HAVE A 
GAME AWAY TO BATH WE MUST RECOVER 
PROPERLY AT THE MOMENT WE ARE OUT 
OF THE TOP FOUR WE HAVE TO FIGHT 
TO GET IN THE TOP FLOOR TOP FOUR 
THANK YOU 
MARTIN ALWAYS TELLS IT LIKE IT IS 
HE HAS NOT HAD MANY GOOD INTERVIEWS 
ON THE PITCH YOU DO NOT A YOUR 
DIRTY WASHING IN PUBLIC THERE ARE 
PROBLEMS AT LEICESTER IT IS 
SOMETHING THEY NEED TO RECTIFY IT 
YOU CAN TELL THE WAY HE BATTED OF 
THE QUESTION THAT IT WAS NOT 
SOMETHING HE WANTED TO DISCUSS I I RESPECT LEICESTER FOR BATH WHAT 
ARE THE PROBLEMS THEY HAVE THEY 
ARE IN IT OUT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS 
WE NEED TO BRING SOMEONE IN FROM 
ANOTHER COUNTRY FOOTBALL IS 
ESTABLISHED YOU CAN BRING IN A 
FRENCH MANAGERS BUT BRINGING IN AN 
ARGENTINIAN COAT TO A CLUB LIKE 
LESTER A TIGHT KNIT FAMILY CLUB 
AND AFRAID IT SEEMS A NICE GUY BUT 
IT 
MUST BE DIFFICULT MARRIAGE HE HE MUST BE FRUSTRATED BY NOT BEING 
ABLE TO TRANSFER HIS MESSAGE ACROSS 
WHAT IT IS THE ARGENTINE WAY OR 
WHETHER HE WILL ADOPT A DIFFERENT 
APPROACH AND TAKE MR. FORD L. THINK 
IT HAS NOT WORKED PEOPLE CAN SIT 
FROM THE OUTSIDE BUT INSIDE THERE 
ARE ISSUES LEICESTER WERE ALWAYS 
INCESTUOUS PEOPLE FROM INSIDER 
DRIVING THE TEAM IT DOES NOT SEEM 
AWAY NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO GET 
IDEAS FROM HIM 
IN ARGENTINA THE 
GAME PLAN IS SIMPLE GOOD FORWARDS 
GOOD DEFENCE A LOT OF UP AND 
ANDERS MAYBE MORE THAN THAT WHEN 
YOU'RE PLAYING CLUB RUGBY BECAUSE 
YOU ARE THERE WEEK IN AND WEEK OUT 
TODAY SHOWED THEY WERE LIMITED YOU 
LOOK AT THE OSPREYS THEY HAVE HAD 
CONTINUITY WITH LYN JONES 
QUESTIONS ABOUT HIM WINNING THINGS 
ADDED PRESSURE BECAUSE WALES WON IT 
WITH OSPREYS BUT THEY HAVE STUCK 
WITH HIM AND REPAID THE FAITH AND AND LEICESTER DID GUTS HAVE THE SNAP 
LEE BYRNE HAD ONE GREAT RUN IN THE 
SECOND HALF AND THAT CREATED THE 
TRY THERE WAS ONE OF SEVERAL 
DURING THE COURSE OF THE GAME LEE LEE BYRNE GOES BETWEEN TWO PLAYERS 
CHUTER DOES NOT MAKE THE TACKLE FROM HERE HE SPOTS AND RUNS AT 
HIM RUNS ON SO HE CAN ADRIFT HE 
HOLDS AND BY THE TIME HE HAS GIVEN 
THE PASS HE HAS ISOLATED THE 
WINGER IT IS AN EASY RUN IN FOR 
ALUN WYN JONES LOOK AT THIS STEP 
CHUTER IS THERE AGAIN FOR HIM THEY 
DO NOT PANIC ONCE THEY BREAK THEY 
HAVE GREAT SUPPORTING PLAYERS IDEA 
OF THICK LEICESTER HAD MANY 
OPPORTUNITIES MAYBE IN THE FIRST 
TEN MINUTES BUT WAS IT I DO NOT 
THINK LEICESTER HAD MANY 
OPPORTUNITIES 
THERE WAS ONE POINT AT THE END YOU 
SHOT UP THE STAIRS TO SEE IT LIKE A 
CHILD AT CHRISTMAS EVE HOW MUCH 
DOES IT MEAN TO 
AN IMPORTANT STEP 
WE WON THE MAGNERS LEAGUE A FEW 
TIMES WE HAVE CROSSED THE LINE WE 
NEED TO BELIEVE AND BUILD IN THE 
FUTURE WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH GOOD 
TIMES AND BAD TIMES IT WAS A TOUGH 
PILL TO SWALLOW DELIGHTED WE 
FULLY DESERVED IT WE KNEW WE WOULD 
WIN WHEN WE TURNED UP IT WAS 
DEVASTATING LAST SUNDAY TODAY WE 
WOULD DEFINITELY GOING TO WIN WE 
HAVE LEARNED A LOT AGAINST 
LEICESTER TODAY IS A MOMENT HOW HOW MUCH SOUL SEARCHING WAS THERE IN 
THE WAKE OF THE DEFEAT TO SARACENS 
THAT BALL YOU BACK TO THIS POINT 
UNLUCKY THERE WAS HARD TALKING AND 
TO BE FAIR THE BOYS HAVE BEEN 
THROUGH A LOT OF HIGHS IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN ALONG THE WAY 
YOU HAVE TO TAKE A DIP WE HAD A 
KICK IN THE PANTS AGAINST SARACENS 
WE WERE FOCUSED AND CAME BACK 
BETTER WE WERE DETERMINED THE 
FELLERS HAD THEIR JUST REWARDS 
WHAT A BY YOUR JUST REWARDS YOU 
CAME UNDER PERSONAL CRITICISM AS A 
COACH OF THE STAR STUDDED TEAM 
LOSING TO SARACENS DO YOU FEEL 
YOUR JOB IS SECURE AND YOU CAN WIN 
IT 
IT COMES TO THE TERRITORY L. IT LOVE THE GAME OF RUGBY AND COACHING 
THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE IN THE 
WELSH SQUAD AS WELL IS PHENOMENAL 
WE ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING WE 
ARE PLUGGING AWAY SLOWLY BUT SURELY 
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE THEIR JOBS TO DO 
LET THEM CARRY ON THANK YOU WELL WELL DONE YOU GOT A SMILE AT THE END 
MORE RUGBY TOMORROW ON B. B. C. TWO

MARATHON TOMORROW GET THE BALL OF
