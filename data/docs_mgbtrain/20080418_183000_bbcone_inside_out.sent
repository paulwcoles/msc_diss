IN HALF AN HOUR EASTENDERS 
BUT NOW INSIDE OUT LONDON 
WITH THREE SURPRISING STORIES 
CLOSE TO HOME 
HELLO WELCOME 
I'M MATTHEW WRIGHT 
YOU'RE WATCHING INSIDE OUT HELLO HELLO HERE'S WHAT'S WELCOME 
COMING UP 
ON TONIGHT'S SHOW 
FIFTY YEARS ON 
WHY VICTIMS OF THALIDOMIDE 
ARE STILL FIGHTING FOR COMPENSATION FIFTY YEARS ON 
THESE PEOPLE MUST MADE 
TO PAY FOR THEIR CRIME 
WHATEVER WE DO THEY HAVE TO PAY 
FOR THEIR DREADFUL CRIME 
THAT IS A BIG RAT 
LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT 
THERE'S ONE BORN EVERY SECOND 
HOW WE'RE HELPING LONDON'S RATS 
BREED OUT OF CONTROL 
TAKE ME ON A TRIP 
AND HOW LONDON'S 
MUSIC MOGULS FAILED TO SPOT 
ESTELLE'S RISING STAR 
I'VE BEEN OFFERED A JOB IN AMERICA 
AND THEY WON'T OFFER ME 
A JOB IN LONDON SO I WENT 
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 
THE CURE FOR MORNING SICKNESS 
BUT THE DRUG PRESCRIBED BY 
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 
THALIDOMIDE CAUSED THE DEATHS 
OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND BABIES WORLDWIDE 
AND THOSE THAT SURVIVED 
WERE LEFT WITH SEVERE DEFORMITIES 
HERE IN BRITAIN 
THE THALIDOMIDERS' FAMILIES 
WON COMPENSATION BASED ON 
THE BELIEF THEIR CHILDREN WOULDN'T 
LIVE LONG BUT FIFTY YEARS ON THEY 
ARE GROWN UP AND STILL GOING STRONG 
AND THEIR PRINCIPAL CARERS 
HAVE EITHER DIED OR ARE TOO OLD 
TO CARE FOR THEM 
SO THE VICTIMS OF THE DRUG FACE NEW 
BATTLES L. WENT TO FIND OUT MORE 
WE DON'T WANT EMPATHY 
WE WANT FINANCIAL SUPPORT 
WHAT WE WANT IS JUSTICE 
AND WE WANT AN APOLOGY FROM THEM 
IT'S A DISGRACE THAT AFTER FIFTY YEARS 
WE HAVE TO STAND OUTSIDE 
THE GERMAN EMBASSY IN LONDON 
AND TRY AND ASK FOR MORE MONEY 
ALL THE PEOPLE DEPICTED 
IN THESE PAINTINGS ARE PART OF 
A CAMPAIGN TO GET COMPENSATION 
FOR THALIDOMIDE SURVIVORS 
THEY'RE ALL MIDDLE AGED 
AS YOU SEE WHICH IS IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE RECORDS 
THEY SHOULDN'T BE HERE ANY MORE 
IN FACT WHEN THEY WERE BORN FORTY ODD 
YEARS AGO HARDLY ANYONE THOUGHT 
THEY'D SURVIVE BEYOND CHILDHOOD 
ONE OF THOSE TO HAVE SURVIVED 
AGAINST THE ODDS IS DOMINIC GALVIN 
HE'S BRAIN DAMAGED AND AT FORTY NINE 
DEPENDS ON HIS MUM FOR EVERYTHING 
SHALL WE DRESS UP TODAY 
LN MY BEST SUIT 
AS WELL AS SPOON FEEDING HIM 
HIS MOTHER SHAVES HIM 
WASHES HIM BRUSHES HIS TEETH 
AND EVEN DRESSES HIM EVERY DAY 
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY QUALITY OF 
LIFE ONLY THE ONE I MAKE FOR HIM 
THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO 
HE CAN'T BE IN CROWDS 
HE CAN'T TAKE FLASHING LIGHTS 
HE WILL NEVER MARRY NOR HAVE 
CHILDREN HE CAN'T BATHE HIMSELF 
CAN'T DRESS CAN'T CO ORDINATE 
I HAVE TO BE HIS CO ORDINATION 
LIKE MANY PREGNANT WOMEN 
IN THE LATE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
SADIE WAS PRESCRIBED THALIDOMIDE 
FOR MORNING SICKNESS BUT THE DRUG 
HAD A DEVASTATING EFFECT 
I THINK IT WAS NINE TABLETS 
THREE DAYS AND NINE BITS OF POISON 
THAT RUINED HIS LIFE AND MINE 
COME ON SWEETHEART 
THAT'S A GOOD BOY 
CARING FOR DOMINIC IS A TWENTY FOUR HOUR 
SEVEN DAY A WEEK JOB 
AND WITH NO ELSE TO HELP 
THERE'S NO RESPITE FOR SADIE 
WITHOUT ME HE'S DEAD 
HE'LL HAVE A FIT AND DIE 
ONE NIGHT RECENTLY 
I ALWAYS HAVE MY EYE ON THE BALL 
I DON'T WHY I TURNED BACK 
BUT HE WAS UPSIDE DOWN 
IN THIS CHAIR UNCONSCIOUS 
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD 
IN THE MORNING 
AND THAT'S ONLY ONE OF HUNDREDS OF 
INCIDENTS YOU NEVER EVER LOOK AWAY 
AT EIGHTY ONE SHE'S GETTING ON 
AND STRUGGLING TO GIVE HER SON 
THE RELENTLESS CARE HE NEEDS 
BUT REPLACING HERSELF WITH 
PROFESSIONAL CARERS ISN'T AN OPTION 
AT THE COST TWO THOUSAND A WEEK 
IT'S MONEY SHE JUST HASN'T GOT 
IF YOU'RE RUNNING A HOSPITAL 
SCHOOL AND HOME YOU NEED MONEY 
SHE FEARS FOR DOMINIC'S FUTURE 
AND WANTS TO ENSURE THERE ARE FUNDS 
TO LOOK AFTER HIM WHEN SHE'S GONE 
SO TODAY THEY'RE JOINING 
A PROTEST MARCH 
THEIR AIM IS SIMPLE 
TO GET COMPENSATION FROM GRUNENTHAL 
THE GERMAN COMPANY THAT 
PRODUCED THALIDOMIDE 
AMAZINGLY THE COMPANY'S NEVER PAID 
A PENNY TO BRITISH SURVIVORS 
ALTHOUGH THEY RECEIVED A PAYOUT 
FROM A DISTRIBUTOR OF THE DRUG 
I THOUGHT THALIDOMIDE VICTIMS 
HAD BEEN COMPENSATED YEARS AGO 
WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING FOR WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IS WHEN COMPENSATION WAS PAID IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE 
THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A 
THALIDOMIDER WAS PROBABLY BELOW THIRTY 
AND AND DIDN'T EXPECT THEM 
TO GET MARRIED 
HAVE CHILDREN AND LIVE TO OLD AGE T. 
TO GET MARRIED 
HAVE CHILDREN AND LIVE TO OLD AGE 
SO THE MONEY AWARDED INITIALLY 
WAS LITERALLY TO SEE YOU THROUGH 
TO WHEN THEY THOUGHT YOU'D DIE 
ABSOLUTELY NOW 
THE BIG PROBLEM FOR THALIDOMIDERS 
IS THEIR PARENTS ARE DYING 
SO THE PEOPLE THEY RELY ON TO LOOK 
AFTER THEM AREN'T AROUND ANY MORE 
SO BRITISH THALIDOMIDERS ARE GOING 
TO HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME 
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THOSE WHO 
HAVE SPENT THEIR LIVES DEALING WITH 
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THALIDOMIDE 
HAVE HAD OTHER CHALLENGES 
TO CONTEND WITH 
AS THEY'RE MOVING INTO MIDDLE AGE 
MANY ARE SUFFERING FROM 
AN UNCHARTED AND UNEXPECTED RANGE 
OF DEBILITATING AILMENTS 
A UNIQUE PHENOMENON 
DOCTORS HAD NOT ANTICIPATED IT OFTEN TAKES ME A FEW ATTEMPTS 
THREE YEARS AGO 
WHEN HE TURNED FORTY TWO KARL FELT 
HIS BODY WAS LITERALLY GIVING UP 
I USED TO BE ABLE TO 
BEND DOWN AND TIE MY SHOES 
USING MY TEETH AND HANDS 
NOW I'LL TAKE THE SHOE OFF 
PUT IT ON THE TABLE TIE IT 
AND FORCE MY FOOT BACK INTO IT 
BENDING AND STRETCHING 
IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT 
I'M GETTING PAINS IN MY HANDS NOW 
PAINS IN MY SHOULDERS 
THE PAIN MEANS 
HE HAS TROUBLE GETTING AROUND 
THERE'S A PARTICULAR MOVEMENT 
I DO TO PUT THE CAR INTO DRIVE 
WHICH INVOLVES PRESSING A BUTTON 
THAT MOVEMENT IS VERY PAINFUL 
IF I DON'T GET IT FIRST TIME 
I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE STRENGTH 
RECOVERS IN MY HAND TO TRY AGAIN 
I'M WEARING MY JOINTS OUT 
IF YOU WERE TO DESIGN A JOINT 
THAT LASTED A LONG TIME 
YOU WOULDN'T DESIGN WHAT I'VE GOT 
THALIDOMIDERS ARE SUFFERING 
FROM ACHES AND PAINS 
IN THEIR FORTIES AND HAVING 
DISABILITIES THAT THEY WOULD EXPECT 
TO HAVE MUCH LATER IN LIFE 
IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH 
THE DRUG ITSELF BUT TO DO WITH 
THE ABNORMAL SKELETAL PATTERNS 
MUSCLES TENDONS AND JOINTS ARE 
BECOMING INFLAMED OR WEARING OUT 
WITH PAIN AND RESTRICTED MOVEMENT 
THE LONG TERM PROSPECT 
OF NORMAL LONGEVITY WHICH THERE IS 
AND INCREASING DISABILITY 
IS A SOMBRE ONE 
THE ACCELERATED AGEING PROCESS HAS 
HUGE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR 
THE SURVIVORS OF THALIDOMIDE 
NOW IN THEIR FORTIES THEY'RE ALREADY 
HAVING TO FORK OUT FOR THE KIND 
OF MEDICAL SUPPORT AND DAILY CARE 
YOU AND I WOULDN'T EXPECT 
TILL WE HIT SEVENTY 
SO THE NEED FOR CASH TO ENSURE THEY 
ARE DECENTLY CARED FOR IS URGENT 
IN WEST LONDON SUKESHI IS 
STRUGGLING TO COME TO TERMS 
WITH HER INCREASING DISABILITY 
HER SPINE IS LITERALLY 
CRUMBLING AWAY 
I'VE RECENTLY BEEN DOWN 
TO ROEHAMPTON TO HAVE X. RAYS TAKEN 
AND I'VE BEEN TOLD 
I HAVE DEGENERATION OF THE SPINE 
WHICH IS DUE TO THALIDOMIDE 
BECAUSE OF MY POSTURE 
HER CONDITION MEANS 
SHE'S IN CONSTANT PAIN 
SHE IS NO LONGER INDEPENDENT 
AND HAS TO EMPLOY A CARER 
TO HELP HER TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY 
DAILY LIFE BEGINS WITH 
SO I HAVE A CARER HELP ME DO THAT 
WITHOUT THE CARER 
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FUNCTION 
BECAUSE NOT AN HOUR GOES BY 
WHEN I DON'T NEED SOME SORT OF HELP 
SUKESHI HAS TO PAY FOR THE CARER 
OUT OF HER OWN POCKET 
AND IS NOW WORRIED ABOUT 
THE EXTRA MEDICAL BILLS SHE'LL FACE 
MONEY IS BENEFICIAL 
BECAUSE I HAVE TO GET 
THE TREATMENT THAT I KNOW I DESERVE 
DO YOU GET SUPPORT 
FROM THE HEALTH SERVICE 
YES I DO I HAVE FOUND 
THE HEALTH SERVICE VERY GOOD 
BUT IT TAKES JUST AS LONG FOR ME AS 
ANY OTHER NATIONAL HEALTH PATIENT 
AND YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING FROM 
GRUNENTHAL THE DRUG MANUFACTURERS 
OF COURSE NOT NO NO 
AND THAT'S THE WHOLE FIGHT 
WHY SHOULD MONEY BE ONE OF THE 
FACTORS THAT WE WORRY ABOUT 
WHEN IT'S BEEN GRUNENTHAL HAS 
SAID THAT IT'S THEIR FAULT 
BACK AT THE DEMONSTRATION 
NICK AND GUY ARE PLANNING 
TO DOORSTEP THE GERMAN AMBASSADOR 
THEY'RE HOPING 
TO CONVINCE HIM TO PUT PRESSURE 
ON GRUNENTHAL THE DRUGS COMPANY 
BUT THEY'RE NOT HAVING MUCH JOY 
I'M ASKING YOU TO RECEIVE A 
DELEGATION OF THALIDOMIDERS WHO 
HAVE COME ALL THE WAY FROM GERMANY 
THE AMBASSADOR IS NOT IN TOWN TODAY 
SO HE CAN'T SEE YOU TODAY 
YOU DON'T SEEM TO CARE 
ABOUT THE THALIDOMIDERS 
NO NO THAT'S NOT CORRECT 
WHY WON'T YOU SEE THEM 
I'M TALKING TO YOU NOW 
YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS FOR WEEKS 
I'M DEPUTY TO THE AMBASSADOR WHO 
IS NOT HERE 
YOU CAN'T MEET MONIKA 
I AM MEETING YOU NOW EVENTUALLY EVENTUALLY THE DEPUTY AMBASSADOR GIVES UP 
AND INVITES THE DELEGATION INSIDE 
FINALLY THEY WENT IN 
BUT IT NEEDED A LOT OF PERSUASION 
ONLY EMBARRASSING THEM WORKED 
WE DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS THEM 
WE JUST WANT TO SIT DOWN WITH THEM 
BUT HE'S NOT WILLING TO TALK TO US 
BUT HOPEFULLY THEY'LL START 
TO SLOWLY CHANGE THEIR MINDS 
THE CAMPAIGN MAY HAVE 
A LONG WAY TO GO 
BUT THALIDOMIDERS HAVE SPENT THEIR 
LIVES FIGHTING FOR THEIR CAUSE 
AND THEY'RE DETERMINED 
TO WIN IN THE END 
IT'S TAKEN FORTY SIX YEARS SO FAR 
FIFTY REALLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO STOP 
IT'S NOT GOING TO AFFECT MORALE 
THESE PEOPLE MUST BE MADE 
TO PAY FOR THEIR CRIME 
THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THE DREADFUL 
CRIME THEY HAVE COMMITTED 
THIS IS ONLY THE START 
OF SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER 
I'D LIKE TO SAY TO GRUNETHAL 
AND THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT 
THIS IS ONLY A DRESS REHEARSAL 
YOU CAN RUN 
YOU CAN HIDE BUT NOT FOREVER TO FIND OUT MORE GO TO 
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT ADDRESS AGAIN 
AT THE END OF TONIGHT'S SHOW 
STILL TO COME 
THE URBAN MUSIC HOPEFULS STRUGGLING 
TO BE HEARD 
THE NEW ARTISTS BECOME 
DISILLUSIONED 
THEY THINK THERE'S THIS BATTLE 
TO TRY AND MAKE THINGS HAPPEN 
THEY'RE BIG THEY'RE HAIRY 
AND THEY MOVE LIKE GREASE LIGHTNING 
WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT 
RATS THAT'S WHAT 
IT'S SAID THAT LONDONERS WERE NEVER 
MORE THAN A FEW METRES FROM A RAT 
WELL NOW THEY'RE GETTING CLOSER 
THE LATEST FIGURES SHOW 
RATS ARE REPRODUCING 
AT ONE PER SECOND 
ONE FRESH NEW RAT 
FOR EVERY SECOND OF TIME PASSED 
AND OUR FILTHY DIRTY HABITS MEAN 
WE'RE ALL TO BLAME 
MIKE DILGER HAS MORE KNOWN AS RATUS NORVEGICUS 
OR TO THE LIKES OF YOU 
AND ME THE COMMON BROWN RAT 
THEY CAN WEIGH UP TO FOUR HUNDRED GRAMS 
AND ARE UP TO EIGHTEEN CM IN LENGTH 
BUT THESE RODENTS ARE CAUSING 
QUITE A STIR IN THE CAPITAL 
SOUTHALL IS JUST ONE OF 
THE MANY AREAS ACROSS THE CAPITAL 
WHICH HAS BIG PROBLEMS 
WITH THESE RODENTS 
ON AVERAGE EALING COUNCIL 
DEALS WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED REPORTED 
RAT SIGHTINGS EVERY MONTH 
TODAY ROY INNIS 
FROM EALING COUNCIL'S PEST CONTROL 
HAS BEEN CALLED IN 
TO DEAL WITH 
AN ONGOING PROBLEM AT THIS CHURCH 
AFTER COMPLAINTS 
FROM LOCAL RESIDENTS 
OUR CHURCH BACKS ONTO THE ALLEYWAY 
WHICH IS WHERE THE SHOPS ARE 
YOU GET A LOT OF WASTE LEFT LYING 
AROUND AND IT ATTRACTS RATS 
YOU CAN SEE THEM 
SCURRYING OUT THE BACK 
L. FOUND ABOUT ONE HUNDRED DROPPINGS 
AT THE BOTTOM OF MY GARDEN 
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN TWO HUNDRED 
THEN ENDED UP WITH FIVE HUNDRED 
I HATE IT 
I HAVE TO MAKE MYSELF PUT ON GLOVES 
AND GET RID OF THE RATS 
BUT I KNOW IT'S FROM THE SHOPS 
JUST AROUND KING STREET 
THEY LEAVE THEIR FOOD 
AND RUBBISH AROUND 
OLIVER MADGE IS FROM THE BRITISH 
PEST CONTROL ASSOCIATION 
HE ESTIMATES THAT 
OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS 
THE NUMBER OF RATS IN LONDON 
HAS INCREASED BY A THIRD 
IT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM 
AND WE'RE ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR IT 
AS A GOOD HIGH STREET EXAMPLE THIS 
IS PROBABLY JUST WHAT YOU'RE AFTER 
WE'VE GOT FAST FOOD OUTLET AND IT 
PROBABLY ISN'T CLEANED UP THAT WELL 
OF AN EVENING AND SO WHEN 
IT'S QUIET AND DARK 
IT'LL BE A HAVEN FOR THEM THERE 
WHAT ABOUT THE BINS OVER HERE 
THE PROBLEM IS THE BUNG AT THE 
BOTTOM THAT ALLOWS THE WATER OUT 
IS MISSING AND LETS THE RATS IN 
THE RATS COME AND FEED WITHOUT WITHOUT ANYONE KNOWING THEY'RE THERE 
RATS HAVE AN AMAZING ABILITY 
TO ADAPT TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT 
ALL THEY NEED IS FOOD 
WATER SHELTER AND WARMTH 
ALL OF WHICH WE PROVIDE FOR THEM 
THEY'RE GREAT AT REPRODUCING TOO 
AN ESTIMATED FOUR THOUSAND RATS ARE BORN 
IN THE CAPITAL EVERY HOUR 
YOU MUST HAVE A SNEAKING 
ADMIRATION FOR THEM 
THEY'RE RESILIENT LITTLE SWINE 
THEY ARE VERY CLEVER 
THEY LIVE OFF HUMANS THE QUANTITY 
OF FOOD THEY NEED ISN'T MUCH 
AND THEY CAN GENETICALLY 
CHANGE THEIR BODIES WITHIN A FEW 
GENERATIONS THEY'RE FASCINATING 
RESIDENTS LIVING ON THIS STREET 
IN SOUTHALL ARE SO FED UP 
OF THEIR FURRY NEIGHBOURS THAT SOME 
OF THEM HAVE DUBBED IT RAT ROAD 
WE'RE IN YOUR GARDEN 
AND YOU'VE HAD SERIOUS 
PROBLEMS WITH RATS 
YES IT USED TO BE A LOVELY 
GARDEN WITH SHRUBS SCENTED JASMINE 
AND I HAD MINT FLOWERS 
OVER THERE TOO 
BUT THEN SUDDENLY I JUST WAS 
INFESTED WITH HUGE RATS 
I WAS SO SCARED CAN SEE THREE FOUR FIVE AT THE SAME TIME 
THAT'S HIDEOUS YOU CAN SEE 
THE DAMAGE THEY HAVE DONE HERE 
THERE'S A HOLE HERE TWO THERE 
AND YOU CAN SEE THEY'VE GNAWED 
THROUGH THE FENCE AMAZING 
AKIMA HAS DECIDED TO TAKE DRASTIC 
ACTION TO GET RID OF THE RATS 
I'M GOING TO PAVE IT AND GET RID OF 
ALL THE PLANTS I HAD HERE 
WHICH IS A SHAME 
I USED TO LOVE IT WE USED 
TO HAVE BBQS AND FRIENDS OVER 
BUT I'M JUST GOING 
TO GET RID OF EVERYTHING NOW 
JUST ACROSS THE ROAD 
CHARLIE HAD TO CALL OUT THE R. A. C. 
TO MEND HIS NEW CAR 
AFTER RATS STARTED NESTING IN IT I GOT INTO THE CAR TO GO TO WORK 
AND AS I WENT TO PUT IT 
IN REVERSE IT WOULDN'T MOVE 
AFTER ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HOURS OF REMOVING 
MOST OF THE COMPONENTS HERE 
THE AIR FILTER HE LOOKED DOWN 
AND SAID I DON'T BELIEVE 
WHAT I'M LOOKING AT 
IT LOOKS LIKE A LAMB BONE 
I SAID YOU'RE JOKING 
IT WAS JAMMED IN 
AND TOOK HIM TWENTY FIVE HOURS TO REMOVE IT 
WHAT PROBLEMS 
HAVE YOU HAD IN THE HOUSE 
THEY'VE DIED UNDER THE FLOOR 
AND THE STENCH IS UNBELIEVABLE 
SEE ALL THE DROPPINGS 
THEY RUN IN AND OUT OF HERE 
IT DOESN'T TAKE A GENIUS TO REALISE 
THIS STREET IS A DES RES FOR RATS 
THOSE BINS ARE OVERFLOWING 
AND THEY'RE A GREAT FOOD SOURCE 
DOWN HERE MATTRESSES COULD EASILY 
PROVIDE THE PERFECT AREA TO NEST 
THAT HOUSE THE FORECOURT 
IS COVERED WITH DROPPINGS 
AND UNDERNEATH THEY'VE GOT UNDER 
THE FLOORBOARDS AS WELL 
BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM 
DESPITE THE SIGNS PEOPLE CONTINUE 
TO PUT FOOD DOWN FOR THE BIRDS 
THERE'S MORE FOOD PUT DOWN 
THAN THE PIGEONS CAN EAT 
WHICH MEANS THERE'S PLENTY 
OF FOOD LEFT FOR THE RATS 
ALSO MANY LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
HAVE STARTED CHARGING 
TO GET RID OF THESE RODENTS 
NEARLY FORTY PER CENT OF LONDON BOROUGHS NOW 
MAKE HOUSEHOLDERS PAY UP TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
TO ERADICATE THEIR RATS 
CONSUMERS AREN'T CALLING 
THE COUNCIL SO THE URBAN AREAS 
THE COMMON AREAS AREN'T BEING 
TREATED BY PEST CONTROLLERS 
THE PROBLEM 
THEN STARTS TO ESCALATE 
IF THEY LEAVE IT TOO LONG 
TO CALL US THEY HAVE MORE RATS 
AND ALL THE BAIT WILL GO 
IT COULD TAKE A COUPLE OF VISITS 
I'VE GOT MY GLOVES 
I'M YOUR ASSISTANT FOR THE DAY 
WHERE DO WE START 
WE'LL START BY 
BAITING THE HOLES ALONG THE FENCE 
GONE ARE THE DAYS OF RAT CATCHING 
ROY'S JOB IS TO BAIT THE AREA 
WITH RAT POISON AND WAIT FOR 
THE GREEDY RODENTS TO FIND IT 
PUT THE BAIT DOWN 
AND COME BACK A WEEK LATER 
WE CHECK THE BAIT SEE WHAT'S EATEN 
AND BACK A WEEK LATER 
AND HOPEFULLY THE CUSTOMER 
ISN'T SEEING ANY MORE RATS 
THIS AREA HAS BEEN BAITED NOW 
FOR SEVERAL WEEKS 
AND THE RATS 
ARE BEGINNING TO DIE OFF 
OH HERE WE GO 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT DEAD RAT 
WE HAVE A RAT A DEAD ONE IS IT 
UGH I CAN SEE ITS TAIL 
JUST GRAB HOLD OF HIM 
HE'S A LOVELY ONE 
YOU SAID HE WAS A LOVELY ONE 
LOOK AT THAT I'VE GOT MY GLOVES ON 
SO I'M FINE 
THAT'S BIG HEAVY RAT LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT THAT'S AN ADULT 
O. K. SO THEY COME OUT AT NIGHT 
HAVE BIG TEETH AND CHOMP ON RUBBISH 
BUT THERE IS SERIOUS SIDE TO THIS THE HEALTH HAZARD 
RATS HAVE TWO MAIN ISSUES ONE IS 
LEPTOSPIROSIS OR WEIL'S DISEASE 
TRANSMITTED THROUGH RAT URINE 
PEOPLE STILL DIE AROUND EIGHTEEN 
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS 
WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS 
VERY SIMILAR TO FLU 
AND THIS CAUSES PART OF THE PROBLEM 
PEOPLE GO TO THE DOCTORS 
IT'S WRITTEN OFF AS FLU 
GO HOME TAKE PARACETAMOL 
AND IT ESCALATES FROM THERE 
THE OTHER SIDE IS SALMONELLA 
A BIG PROBLEM WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT 
THEY CAN LIVE UNDERGROUND IN 
THE SEWERS WITH ALL THE BACTERIA 
THEY THEN POP UP AND IF IT'S 
IN A FOOD PREPARATION AREA 
OR THEY WALK OVER FOODS IT CAN BE 
TRANSMITTED THAT WAY AS WELL 
IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT REDUCING 
THE NUMBER OF RATS IN THE CAPITAL 
THEN WE ALL NEED TO START TAKING 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR RUBBISH 
THE MAIN PART WE HAVE TO START WITH 
IS TAKING AWAY THEIR FOOD SOURCE 
TAKE AWAY WATER FOOD AND DON'T 
GIVE THEM ANYWHERE TO LIVE 
THE PUBLIC HAVE TO BE AWARE THAT 
THIS IS VERY SERIOUS ISSUE 
IT'S NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM 
THE U. K.'S URBAN MUSIC SCENE 
HAS SPAWNED SOME BIG NAMES 
OVER THE YEARS INCLUDING ESTELLE 
WHOSE SINGLE AMERICAN BOY 
TOPPED THE U. K. CHARTS 
BUT MANY SAY HER SUCCESS 
OWES NOTHING TO THE 
LONDON MUSIC BUSINESS 
YOUNG URBAN MUSICIANS SAY 
THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO BE HEARD 
AND MAKE IT BIG TIME 
JORDAN KENSINGTON WHO'S CLOSELY 
INVOLVED WITH URBAN MUSIC 
WENT TO FIND OUT WHAT'S HOLDING 
BACK OUR YOUNG HOMEGROWN TALENT 
I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE U. K.'S 
URBAN MUSIC SCENE FOR TEN YEARS 
RUNNING INVINCIBLE MAGAZINE RADIO 
T. V. AND THE URBAN MUSIC AWARDS IN 
THE U. K. AND U. S. AND WORLDWIDE 
ALL WITH THE AIM 
OF SUPPORTING URBAN MUSIC 
FIVE YEARS AGO MOST U. K. URBAN 
ARTISTS LIKE BEVERLEY KNIGHT 
MIS DYNAMITE AND LEMAR WERE DOING 
WELL IN THE U. K. AND INTERNATIONALLY 
NOWADAYS SUPPORT FOR URBAN MUSIC 
ISN'T ONE HUNDRED PER CENT LIKE IT SHOULD BE 
THERE'S DEFINITELY TALENT OUT THERE 
BUT IT'S NOT BEING NURTURED 
IN THE WAY IT SHOULD BE 
FOR CASE IN POINT JUST LOOK AT ESTELLE 
THIS IS A NUMBER ONE 
CHAMPION SOUND 
FOUR YEARS AGO SHE WAS A RISING 
STAR ON THE CAPITAL'S HIP HOP SCENE 
BUT NONE OF THE U. K. RECORD LABELS 
SEEMED TO KNOW HOW TO PROMOTE HER 
SO RATHER THAN SEE HER CAREER STALL 
SHE MOVED TO NEW YORK AND CUT AN 
ALBUM WITH KANYE WEST 
TAKE ME ON A TRIP 
I'D LIKE TO GO SOMEDAY 
TAKE ME TO NEW YORK 
I'D BEEN OFFERED A JOB IN AMERICA 
BUT NOT IN LONDON SO I WENT 
SHE HAD BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY 
FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND PEOPLE WERE JUST NOT INTERESTED 
MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT 
YOU GET TO A CERTAIN LEVEL 
AND THEY DON'T KNOW 
WHAT TO DO WITH IT 
OR THEY DON'T EXPECT IT 
TO GO TO A CERTAIN LEVEL 
ESTELLE THOUGHT O. K. YOU DON'T 
WANT TO LISTEN TO ME HERE 
I'LL GET MY MATES AROUND ME 
AMERICANS WHO EVERYBODY LISTENS TO 
AND I'LL SHOW YOU EXACTLY 
WHAT I CAN DO 
IT TAKES A FEW TO REALLY PUSH AND 
BELIEVE LIKE THEY HAVE WITH ME 
AND BE LIKE NO THIS IS IT 
ESTELLE'S NUMBER ONE SINGLE PROVES 
THAT WITH THE RIGHT SUPPORT 
U. K. ARTISTS CAN BE BIG THE ISSUE 
IS THE RADIO STATIONS PROMOTERS 
AND T. V. STATIONS ARE NOT PREPARED 
TO INVEST THEIR MONEY INTO A SCENE 
THAT'S GOT THE POTENTIAL 
TO BECOME EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL 
WHEN I STARTED CHATTING TO ARTISTS 
IT WAS CLEAR THAT ALL OF THEM 
FROM RISING TALENT TO MASSIVE STARS 
RECKON THERE ARE MAJOR PROBLEMS 
WITH THE U. K.'S URBAN SCENE 
THE PROBLEM IS WHEN RADIO STATIONS 
OR T. V. WANT TO PLAY YOUR STUFF 
THEY HEAR URBAN AND THINK 
WE DON'T WANNA DO THIS 
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH 
SUPPORT IN THE U. K. 
AND NEW ARTISTS 
BECOME DISILLUSIONED 
AND THERE'S THIS CONSTANT BATTLE 
TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN 
OUR URBAN MUSIC INDUSTRY 
HAS NEVER HAD SUPPORT 
IT'S HARD FOR URBAN ACTS 
IN THIS COUNTRY 
AND WITH THE BRITS GETTING RID OF 
THE URBAN DIVISION 
AND WHEN THEY HAD IT 
URBAN PEOPLE NOT WINNING IT 
SO ITS ALWAYS BEEN HARD 
TO PLAY IT COOL IN A COOL WAY 
COS I KNOW YOU'RE NO FOOL 
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT THERE ARE 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO FEEL 
THAT THEIR MUSIC ISN'T GETTING 
THE SUPPORT THAT IT DESERVES 
AND FOR ARTISTS WITHOUT ANY 
TRADITIONAL INDUSTRY SUPPORT 
THERE'S AN EVEN STRONGER SENSE 
OF GRIEVANCE 
YOU'VE GOT AT LEAST FORTY U. K. URBAN 
ARTISTS DOING REALLY WELL 
BUT NOT THROUGH THE HELP OF 
A RECORD COMPANY 
BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN HARD GRAFT 
I'M IN THAT CATEGORY 
COS I'M UNSIGNED AND EVERYTHING 
I'VE ACHIEVED MYSELF 
SOME FINGERS ARE DEFINITELY BEING 
POINTED AT THE RECORD LABELS 
SO I MET UP WITH A PROMOTER WHO'S 
WORKED AT SOME OF THE U. K.'S BIGGEST 
TO FIND OUT WHY THEY'RE NOT GETTING 
BEHIND THE TALENT HERE 
WITH AMERICA THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS 
TOTALLY DIFFERENT TO OUT HERE 
OUT THERE YOU'VE NOT JUST GOT 
THE ASSOCIATION WITH BIG ACTS 
YOU HAVE A AND AMP R. TEAMS AND MANAGERS WHO 
ARE MORE EXPERIENCED THAN U. K. ONES 
DO YOU THINK IT'S A LACK OF 
CREATIVITY ON THE PART OF LABELS 
OR DO YOU THINK RADIO STATIONS ARE 
MORE TO BLAME ABOUT THAT 
EVER SINCE WE'VE DONE PROMOTION 
WE'VE ALWAYS HAD TROUBLE 
ON THE DAYTIME RADIO PLAYLIST 
SPECIALIST SUPPORT'S BEEN GREAT 
BUT TO TAKE IT TO DAYTIME RADIO 
HAS BEEN QUITE DIFFICULT 
THE MENTALITY OF RECORD LABELS IS 
PART OF THE PROBLEM 
BUT ARTISTS ALSO NEED 
DECENT AIRPLAY ON RADIO AND T. V. 
TO STAND A CHANCE OF MAKING IT BIG 
EVEN THOUGH SOME OF ITS SHOWS HAVE 
HAD A STRONG AMERICAN BIAS 
THE B. B. C.'S ONE X. T. R. A IS ONE OF THE FEW 
PLACES REALLY BEHIND U. K. URBAN MUSIC 
BUT I WANTED TO HEAR FROM THE D. J.'S 
WHY SO LITTLE MUSIC 
IS GIVEN EXPOSURE ON 
MORE MAINSTREAM STATIONS 
IT'S EIGHT IN THE MORNING FOR 
THE ONE X. T. R. A BREAKFAST SHOW 
IT'S NOT EASY TO MARKET 
AN URBAN ACT PROPERLY 
IF YOUR RECORD COMPANY IS 
BUILT ON POP AND ROCK AND INDIE 
OUTSIDE LONDON IT'S VERY STRANGE 
PLACE IN TERMS OF BLACK MUSIC 
YOU'RE GOING TO A PLACE 
WHERE ROBBIE WILLIAMS IS KING 
AND THEY DON'T HAVE A GRASP OF 
BASSLINE GRIME AND URBAN MUSIC 
THE DAY I SEE BLACK ARTIST BORN 
IN THE U. K. DOING A KNEBWORTH 
THE SIZE OF A ROBBIE WILLIAMS 
I WILL EAT MY FOOT 
FRANCE HAS A QUOTA SYSTEM 
WHICH MEANS THAT FORTY PER CENT OF THE SONGS 
PLAYED ON RADIO THERE 
HAVE TO BE FRENCH LANGUAGE THIS 
HAS GIVEN FRENCH HIP HOP BOOST 
SHOULDN'T THE SAME PRINCIPLE BE 
USED TO PROTECT URBAN MUSIC HERE 
IF RADIO STATIONS STARTED PLAYING 
FORTY PER CENT U. K. MUSIC AND IT WASN'T HOT 
PEOPLE WOULD GO ELSEWHERE 
TO GET THEIR MUSIC 
I'M NOT A AND AMP R. 
THAT I WANT TO MAKE AN ARTIST 
I JUST WANT TO REFLECT 
WHAT IS HAPPENING OUT THERE 
IF YOU WANT TO BE AN ARTIST 
YO START MAKING RECORDS 
PUT THEM OUT AS M. P. THREES START 
CREATING THAT MOVEMENT AND MOMENTUM 
IT STILL DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT TO ME 
THAT ALL THE PRESSURE 
IS PUT ON THE ARTISTS THEMSELVES 
TO GENERATE THE FIRST WAVE OF 
SUPPORT FOR THEIR MUSIC 
AT THE END OF THE DAY 
D. J.'S ARE TASTEMAKERS 
WHO WIELD HUGE POWER AND INFLUENCE 
WHAT ABOUT THE ACTS THAT HAVE 
THE TALENT BUT NOT THE MARKETING 
SKILLS TO GET NOTICED 
M. T. V. BASE WAVES THE FLAG FOR U. K. 
URBAN ACTS ALONGSIDE AMERICAN ONES 
BUT THEY STILL DEPEND ON LABELS TO 
DELIVER THEM PRODUCT THEY CAN USE 
WE CAN ONLY TAKE IN 
WHAT RECORD LABEL SEND US 
IF THE RECORD LABELS AREN'T 
INSPIRED BY U. K. URBAN MUSIC 
IF THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT 
IF MOST OF THEIR M. D.'S ARE WHITE 
MIDDLE AGED MEN 
WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MUSIC 
WHO CANT RELATE TO IT 
WHO ARE SCARED OF IT THEY WON'T 
GET THEIR STAFF TO SUPPORT IT 
IF THERE WERE MORE OF US 
WITHIN THOSE RECORD LABELS 
WHO COULD SELL OUR MUSIC 
BACK TO OUR COMMUNITIES 
IT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL 
IT'S BEEN A FRUSTRATING PROCESS 
SPEAKING TO PEOPLE 
FROM THE INDUSTRY IT FEELS LIKE 
EVERYONE'S PASSING THE BUCK 
RATHER THAN ACCEPTING 
RESPONSIBILITY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DIFFICULTIES 
FACING URBAN ACTS HERE 
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO BE 
ANY OVERNIGHT SOLUTIONS 
BUT PERHAPS ONE OF THE KEYS TO 
ENSURING THE ESTELLES OF TOMORROW 
CAN SUCCEED HERE LIES IN MORE 
COMPREHENSIVE GRASSROOTS TRAINING 
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE INDUSTRY 
OR SOME COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY 
COULD PUT A COURSE TOGETHER FOR 
PERFORMERS TO EDUCATE THEMSELVES 
ON THE BUSINESS SIDE OF THINGS 
SENDING E. MAILS LIAISING 
THE LANGUAGE THEY NEED TO BE ABLE 
TO SPEAK IN ORDER TO BRIDGE IT 
FROM CORPORATE TO URBAN 
OR URBAN TO CORPORATE 
IT'D BE GREAT IF IN FIVE YEARS' 
TIME NO ONE HAD TO DISCUSS 
AIRPLAY QUOTAS AND ARTISTS BEING 
FORCED TO MOVE ABROAD AND INSTEAD
