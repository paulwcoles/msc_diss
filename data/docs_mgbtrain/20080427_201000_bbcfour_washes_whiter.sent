FANTASY IS CRUCIAL WHEN ADVERTISERS SELL TO WOMEN AS INDIVIDUALS 
SELLING ITEMS FOR THEIR OWN PLEASURE 
BUY YOURSELF ENJOY YOURSELF 
CADBURY'S FLAKE SIXPENCE WORTH OF HEAVEN 
WE'RE TRYING TO SELL EFFECTIVELY 
SO WE TAP INTO EXISTING TRENDS EXISTING FANTASIES 
EXISTING ASPIRATIONS MORE THAN INVENT THEM 
MAKE UP NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE TELL MORE IT'S GLAMOROUS 
IT GIVES YOU THE PEARLIEST PEACHIEST COMPLEXION 
GROOVY 
IT'S HARD TO GET WOMEN TO FANTASISE 
WITHOUT USING THE CLICHE OF MALE FANTASY THEY'VE BEEN FED FOR YEARS 
WOMEN TEND TO TROT OUT A CADBURY'S MILK TRAY FANTASY 
TURKISH DELIGHT FANTASY THAT SORT OF TERRITORY 
YOU FEEL YOUR HEART MISS A BEAT 
IT'S THE SULTAN'S FAVOURITE TREAT 
ADVERTISING IS AN EMOTIONAL BAROMETER OF THE TIMES 
IF IT GETS THE FANTASY WRONG IT WON'T WORK 
IN THE PERSONAL INDULGENCE MARKET 
PRODUCTS AIMED AT WOMEN RELY ON FANTASY AND ASPIRATION TO SELL 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DRINK I'D LOVE A BABYCHAM 
NOT ALL BRANDS HAVE MANAGED TO GET THE FANTASY RIGHT 
HEY I'D LOVE A BABYCHAM 
BABYCHAM HAS BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN MANY 
I'D LOVE A BABYCHAM I'D LOVE A BABYCHAM 
I'D LOVE A BABYCHAM 
HEY BABYCHAM 
BABYCHAM'S CARTOON CHAMOIS MADE HIS DEBUT IN THE SECOND COMMERCIAL 
BROADCAST ON INDEPENDENT T. V. 
WITH AUSTERITY IN MIND HE PROMISED INNOCENT RESTRAINED INDULGENCE 
BUT INDULGENCE NEVERTHELESS 
BABYCHAM 
I'D LOVE A BABYCHAM EVERYONE LOVES A BABYCHAM 
GENUINE CHAMPAGNE PERRY 
THE BABYCHAM BOTTLE FILLS A CHAMPAGNE GLASS 
BABYCHAM WAS DESIGNED TO APPEAL TO WOMEN AS A FEMININE DRINK 
BRIGHT LIGHT SPARKLING SPECIAL 
AND GOT AWAY FROM THOSE RATHER GREY YEARS OF THE WAR AND THE POST WAR 
AND MADE THEM FORGET EVERYTHING 
THEY FELT PAMPERED AND SPECIAL 
THE PROBLEM FOR INDULGENCE BRANDS IN THE FIFTIES 
WAS HOW TO COMPETE WITH THE GLORIOUS HUES OF CINEMA ADVERTS 
CADBURY'S ROSES CHOCOLATES IN THE GAYEST OF WRAPPERS 
WONDERFUL WONDERFUL ROSES MAGIC COLOURS TO TOUCH YOUR HEART 
ENJOY THESE CHOCOLATES THAT LOOK DIVINE 
CHOCOLATES WITH WRAPPERS THAT SPARKLE AND SHINE 
ON THE BIG SCREEN ADVERTISERS RESTORED COLOUR TO POST WAR LIFE 
BUT T. V. WAS A BLACK AND WHITE WORLD 
DIRECTORS PERSEVERED REGARDLESS 
HARMONY COMES IN FIVE SHADES HONEY BLONDE 
GOLD BROWN NATURAL BROWN 
CHESTNUT BROWN AUBURN 
FOR YOU HARMONY HAIR COLORANT 
IMAGINE PARIS CAPTURED IN WATERCOLOURS 
THE WARM PINK OF HER SUNRISE SOFT GREEN LEAVES BLOSSOMS OF YELLOW 
THE BLUE OF HER RIVER AND FRESH WHITE SAILS 
NOW CAMAY SOAP HAS THE SAME LOVELY PASTELS 
COLOUR WAS CRUCIAL 
PINK SOAP UNOBTAINABLE DURING THE WAR 
WAS SEIZED ON AS IRRESISTIBLY FEMININE 
FABULOUS PINK CAMAY IS THE WORLD'S MOST LUXURIOUS BEAUTY SOAP 
CAMAY AND OTHER SOAP BRANDS DISCOVERED THAT THE BATHROOM 
NEEDN'T BE FUNCTIONAL IT WAS A SYMBOL 
REMEMBER A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE BATHROOMS 
OR ELSE THEY WERE INADEQUATE 
A BATHROOM WAS A PLACE OF PRIVACY IT WAS ALSO A PLACE OF INDULGENCE 
IT WAS A SUBSTITUTE FOR SEXUAL INDULGENCE WHICH WAS FORBIDDEN 
SO YOU HAD YOUR BATH INSTEAD 
SURRENDER TO THE CARESSING LUXURY OF PINK CAMAY OH THAT PERFUME 
THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING SO LINGERINGLY LOVELY 
IN A BEAUTY SOAP 
IT WAS A PLACE WHERE YOU COULD PAMPER YOURSELF 
AND ASPIRE THROUGH THE PRODUCTS TO SOME DEGREE OF LUXURY 
A STAR 
A STAR 
THE LUXURY SOAP FROM LEVER BROTHERS DREW ITS GLAMOUR FROM HOLLYWOOD 
A NEW STAR ENTERS THE FIRMAMENT 
SHE'S A STAR A STAR A STAR 
INTRODUCING MISS KAY KENDALL HER APPEAL IS FUNDAMENTAL 
HER ADVICE TO YOU 
IF YOU ARE LONGING TO KEEP YOUR SKIN LIKE SATIN 
IS WHEN YOU CHOOSE THE SOAP TO USE 
BE QUITE SURE IT'S WHITE AND PURE 
IT'S USED BY NINE OUT OF TEN FILM STARS 
I MEAN GIRLS NOT MEN 
YOU KNOW THE NAME I HOPE 
IT'S LUX LUX LUX LUX LUX TOILET SOAP 
THE REMOTENESS OF FILM STARS HOWEVER MIGHT BE A LIABILITY 
ON OCCASIONS LUX ADVERTISING PLACED THE CONSUMER BACK IN THE FANTASY 
TIME TO DREAM 
LUX IS A FILM STAR FEELING 
LOOK THERE'S GEORGE BAKER 
SHE'S PRETTY SHE'S GOT A LOVELY COMPLEXION 
WHO'S THE YOUNG LADY MR. BAKER 
LUX IS A FILM STAR FEELING 
LUX LATHER YOUR BEAUTY CARE 
PALMOLIVE PITCHED THE FANTASY LOWER 
THEIR HEROINES WERE DRAWN FROM ASPIRATIONAL PROFESSIONS 
DANCERS AIR HOSTESSES AND FASHION MODELS 
HERE'S ANNE A LOVELY MODEL 
WHO KNOWS PALMOLIVE'S RICH LATHER CLEANS AND SOOTHES SKIN 
KEEPS HER COMPLEXION SOFT AND YOUNG 
MODELS IN THESE COMMERCIALS WERE GENERALLY BRUNETTES 
BLONDES HAD BEEN TARNISHED BY THEIR BAD GIRL IMAGE IN FIFTIES CINEMA 
AND THE CATWALK WAS NOW ACCEPTABLE 
YES I ALWAYS USE PALMOLIVE 
NO OTHER SOAP KEEPS MY SKIN SO SOFT AND SMOOTH 
THERE'S AN INVITATION TO ROMANCE 
FOR THE GIRL WITH THE CAMAY COMPLEXION 
IN ADVERTISING FANTASIES CLASS AND ROMANCE WENT HAND IN HAND 
BEAUTY WAS THE PASSPORT TO BOTH 
A MOTIF OF HIGH SOCIETY WAS THE BALL 
LOOK YOUR LOVELIEST WITH KNIGHT'S CASTILE 
THE FIFTIES WAS ALL ABOUT ROMANCE WHERE A PRINCE WOULD CARRY YOU OFF 
TO A WONDERFUL WORLD OF ROMANCE WHERE WASHING UP DIDN'T EXIST 
BUT IT WAS ALSO AN ASPIRATION BEING A WIFE WAS A CAREER 
MARRIAGE WAS A PASSPORT TO A DIFFERENT LIFE 
YOUR WISH COMES TRUE 
WHEN WOMEN OF THE FIFTIES SAID WHAT THEY WANTED IN A HUSBAND IT WAS 
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T ROUGH ME UP 
THIS ASPIRATION TO A GENTLE MAN WAS TRANSLATED INTO 
SOMEONE WHO WILL LOOK AFTER ME 
AS SOON AS JOHN SAW ANNE 
HE CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT FINDING AN EMPTY COMPARTMENT 
DURING THESE EARLY YEARS ROMANCE WAS A PASSIVE AFFAIR 
A GIRL HAD TO WAIT FOR IT 
SO WHEN ROMANCE STEPS INTO YOUR LIFE 
WHEN THE CURTAIN RISES ON ROMANCE 
WHEN ROMANCE DRIFTS DOWN THE RIVER 
WHEN ROMANCE FINDS YOU 
LOOK YOUR LOVELIEST BY USING KNIGHT'S CASTILE 
THE NINETEEN FIFTIES HEROINE HAD ALWAYS TO APPEAR PASSIVE 
SHE HAD TO BE CONSTANTLY WAITING FOR HER HERO TO TURN UP 
WITHOUT APPEARING TO WAIT 
AND HER TIME WAS DEVOTED TO GETTING READY FOR THAT MOMENT 
FOR SILKEN CURLS HE LOVES TO TOUCH 
HER CASTILE COMPLEXION CATCHES ANY MAN'S EYE 
THIS IS THE LOOK HE'LL NOTICE THE SKIN NO MAN CAN IGNORE 
A BETTER CATCH FOR ANY MAN 
FOR SILKEN CURLS HE LOVES TO TOUCH USE TWINK 
THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC 
CALLED LO O. OVE 
BUT THIS DISPLAY OF AFFECTION BROUGHT A PROBLEM ALL OF ITS OWN 
IF MEN WERE ALLOWED THIS CLOSE HOW WOULD WOMEN MEASURE UP TO SCRUTINY 
IN THE CLOSEST OF CLOSE UPS AVA GARDNER HAS A FLAWLESS SKIN 
REMEMBER YOU HAVE YOUR CLOSE UPS TOO 
YOUR COMPLEXION CAN BE YOUR MOST ATTRACTIVE FEATURE 
SMALL WONDER WOMEN FOREVER CHECKED THEIR APPEARANCE 
BECAUSE YOU CARE ABOUT THE WAY YOU LOOK CHOOSE PALMOLIVE 
MADE WITH OLIVE OIL 
SOON THEY FOUND ANOTHER WORRY 
I WAS GOOD AS A SECRETARY BUT I WASN'T SURE MY BOSS KNEW 
THEN ONE DAY 
B. O. 
B. O. 
B. O. 
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A FEAR OF REVEALING YOUR CLASS ORIGINS 
BY APPEARING UNWASHED 
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE CLASS DISTINCTION 
THOSE WHO SMELT BAD AND THOSE WHO SMELT NICE 
BUT IT WAS VERY MUCH REINFORCED DURING THIS PERIOD 
THE SECRETARY WHO EMERGED LOOKING PERFECT WANTED PEOPLE TO BELIEVE 
SHE HAD A WONDERFUL BATHROOM 
BUT SHE WAS ADMIRED FOR LOOKING PERFECT WITHOUT A BATHROOM 
THE SHAME WAS OF BEING FOUND OUT 
I EVEN GOT A BONUS LAST WEEK 
YES I SAY THANK YOU TO LIFEBUOY TOILET SOAP 
SELLING PRODUCTS ON FEAR SOON CLASHED WITH THE MOOD OF THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
ADVERTISING SHED INHIBITIONS 
PALLADIUM GIRLS PROVE SARONGSTER GIRDLES WITH CROSS OVER PANELS 
A NEW ADVERTISING STRATEGY 
BROUGHT A PROMISE OF PLEASURE AND PHYSICAL SENSATION 
IT'S THAT LOVELY LIVELY LYRIL FEELING 
YOU JUST BUBBLE OVER 
I THOUGHT SOAP WAS JUST SOAP BUT OH THIS LYRIL 
GET THAT LOVELY LIVELY LYRIL FEELING 
IT'S SENSATIONAL 
TOOTHPASTE OFFERED TO THE TONGUE WHAT SOAP DID FOR THE SKIN 
TINGLING FRESH TINGLING FRESH 
PERSONAL HYGIENE WAS NO LONGER CONFINED TO THE BATHROOM 
FEEL THAT HEALTHY S. R. TINGLE 
THAT TINGLE TELLS YOU S. R. PROTECTS TEETH AND GUMS 
FEARS ABOUT SMELL AND BACTERIA 
WERE REPLACED BY A MORE POTENT SELLING PROPOSITION SEX 
WHO SAYS NICE GIRLS DON'T GET FRESH WHEN YOU'RE LIFEBUOY FRESH 
NICE THINGS HAPPEN TO NICE GIRLS 
A FAVOURITE LOCATION FOR THESE NEW PERMISSIVE COMMERCIALS WAS THE BEACH 
NEW REXONA'S WONDERFUL 
STRICTLY FOR THE BIRDS 
I FEEL GOOD 
I FEEL FRESH 
I FEEL PRETTY 
I FEEL A WOMAN 
FRESH AND FEMALE THE NEW REXONA 
STRICTLY FOR THE BIRDS 
SOMETIMES THE BEACH WAS USED VERY MUCH AS A GET AWAY FEELING 
A FEELING OF FREEDOM 
AND A FEELING THAT ANYTHING CAN BE ACHIEVED YOU CAN BE WHO YOU WANT 
THE REAL TERRITORY OF THE BEACH AND OF THE WATER 
IN PSYCHOLOGICAL TERMS IS DEEPLY YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS 
WHAT IT REPRESENTS IS YOUR DESIRES AND YOUR INNER FEELINGS 
THESE DESIRES AND FEELINGS WERE ASSISTED BY ANOTHER ROMANTIC SYMBOL 
THE HORSE 
GALAXY MILK CHOCOLATE TASTES SMOOTHER THAN YOU EVER DREAMED 
SMOOTHER SMOOTHER SMOOTHER 
THIS IS NO ORDINARY BLONDE THIS IS A WOOD NYMPH BLONDE 
ENJOY FLAKE 
CADBURY'S FLAKE 
FOLD UPON FOLD OF CREAMY MILK CHOCOLATE 
CADBURY'S FLAKE TOOK INDULGENCE ADVERTISING TO NEW HEIGHTS 
WITH ITS SUGGESTIVE NOW CLASSIC IMAGERY 
IT'S A BRAND YOU CLEARLY DON'T SHARE 
THAT'S WHY FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS ADVERTISING STARTED WITH 
A HEAVEN ALL OF YOUR OWN 
THEN SIXPENCE WORTH OF HEAVEN WHEN THEY WERE SIX D. 
NOW IT'S THE CRUMBLIEST FLAKIEST MILK CHOCOLATE ALWAYS ONE PERSON 
BUY YOURSELF ENJOY YOURSELF 
TALKING OF PRIVATE SPACE IS BEING A LITTLE COY 
IT'S WHAT YOU DO IN YOUR PRIVATE SPACE THAT MATTERS 
THOSE COMMERCIALS ARE ABOUT SENSUALITY NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT 
PEOPLE LIKE LICKING AND SUCKING 
A FLAKE COMMERCIAL IS HONESTLY ABOUT THE PLEASURE OF CONSUMPTION 
BUY YOURSELF ENJOY YOURSELF 
I THINK IT'S A MALE INTERPRETATION OF TIME ALONE 
IT MAY BE WHAT A MAN IMAGINES A WOMAN MIGHT DO WHEN SHE'S ALONE 
BUT I CAN TELL THEM IT'S NOT WHAT A WOMAN MIGHT DO WHEN SHE'S ALONE 
SHE EATS HER FLAKE OR WALNUT WHIP 
BUT MALE DIRECTORS REGULARLY TOOK LIBERTIES WITH INDULGENCE BRANDS 
ONE OF THEIR FAVOURITE EUPHEMISMS FOR FEMALE PLEASURE 
WAS CAMERA SUN GLARE 
ONLY THE CRUMBLIEST FLAKIEST CHOCOLATE 
TASTES LIKE CHOCOLATE NEVER TASTED BEFORE 
THE REFRESHER 
LET'S GET AWAY ON A SUNNY DAY WITH REFRESHER 
CHOCOLATEY COATING ON GOLDEN VANILLA ICE CREAM 
BUT WHAT IT DOES 
WALL'S ICE CREAM CHOC BAR THE REFRESHER 
NOT ALL BRANDS WERE SO PREOCCUPIED WITH SEX 
SUNSILK'S DEPICTION OF PRIVATE PLEASURE WAS MORE INNOCENT 
A GIRL'S MOST IMPORTANT COSMETIC IS HER SHAMPOO HER SUNSILK 
SHAMPOOS BY THE NINETEEN SIXTIES HAD DISPLACED HOME PERMS 
AS THE BRITISH WOMAN'S FAVOURITE BEAUTY PRODUCT 
A SUNSILK TO PUT SUNSHINE IN YOUR HAIR AND MAKE IT FEEL LIKE SILK 
LETTING YOUR HAIR DOWN EXPRESSED A RELAXED ATTITUDE TO LIFE 
THE BRUNETTE CHERISHED DURING THE PREVIOUS DECADE 
NOW FOUND A NEW RIVAL THE SIXTIES BLONDE 
SUNSILK HAS STOLEN GYPSY KNOWLEDGE OF HERBS AND BEAUTIFUL HAIR 
SKOL LAGER LOVELY NOW 
AND AFTER LAGER SKOL 
WOODPECKER WOODPECKER WOODPECKER CIDER 
YOU'LL REMEMBER THE TASTE JUST REMEMBER THE NAME 
BLONDE DUBONNET 
DUBONNET BLONDE 
GENTLEMEN PREFER DUBONNET BLONDE 
SOME BLONDES WERE FALSE BLONDES 
WHAT ONE'S MOTHER CALLED RACY FAST LADIES UNNATURAL 
THE OTHER SORT OF BLONDES ARE THE INNOCENT ONES 
ELIDA GIBBS TACKLED THE TARNISHED REPUTATION OF THE BLONDE 
WITH WOOD NYMPH 
A HAIR BLEACH WHICH ACTUALLY PROMISED INNOCENCE THIS IS NO ORDINARY BLONDE 
THIS IS A WOOD NYMPH BLONDE 
WOOD NYMPH THE NEW HAIR LIGHTENER BY ELIDA 
WOOD NYMPH WAS A BLEACH 
BUT IT ALSO HAD SOME COLOURS SOME DYE IN IT 
BLEACH ON ITS OWN TAKES COLOUR OUT AND LEAVES HAIR LOOKING BRASSY 
HENCE FAST LADIES BECAUSE THEY HAD FALSE LOOKING HAIR RACY 
BUT WOOD NYMPH ALLOWED THE HAIR TO HAVE A BIT OF TONE PUT BACK IN 
MORE NATURAL CHILD LIKE INNOCENCE 
BUT AS ELIDA GIBBS KNEW INNOCENCE WASN'T ALWAYS WHAT A GIRL WANTED 
THERE WERE SEVEN OF US 
THOUSANDS HAVE TRIED BEFORE 
THIS IS WHERE THEY LEFT THEIR BONES 
WE KNEW WHAT WAS WAITING FOR US 
IF HAIR BLEACH REHABILITATED BLONDES BY ASSOCIATION WITH INNOCENCE 
HAIR DYES PROMISED THE OPPOSITE TURNING NICE GIRLS INTO VAMPS 
THE SEA WITCHES THE GREEKS KNEW ABOUT THEM 
THE FACES OF MORTAL WOMEN BUT THEIR HAIR 
THEIR HAIR IS LEGEND 
WERE THESE THE VANISHED DESCENDANTS OF EVE THERE WERE SEVEN OF US 
THIS IS WHAT WE WERE AFTER 
THE HAIR COLOURS OF SEA WITCH SEMI PERMANENT SIMPLE TO USE 
TWELVE COLOURS 
THERE'S ONE FOR YOU 
AT YOUR CHEMIST FOUR SLASH ELEVEN D. 
THEY ALLOWED YOU TO BE ANYTHING THAT YOU WANTED TO BE 
THE ADVERTISING REFLECTS THAT ASSERTIVENESS 
AND IT REFLECTS THE FANTASTIC CINEMATIC IMAGES SUCH AS JAMES BOND 
THAT WERE POPULAR AT THE TIME 
AND SHOWED VERY VERY DOMINANT WOMEN 
IN THESE NEW AGGRESSIVE FANTASIES 
BAD GIRLS WERE BRUNETTES THEY WENT OUT AND GOT IT 
MONDAY FELT MONDAYISH 
TUESDAY BOUGHT A PACKET OF HARMONY HAIR COLOUR 
PERSONAL TRANSFORMATION PERFECTLY FITTED THE VALUES OF SIXTIES BRITAIN 
WHERE YOU CAME FROM DIDN'T MATTER WHERE YOU WERE GOING TO DID 
WEDNESDAY WEDNESDAY FELT RATHER BETTER 
THIS GATE CRASHING SOCIETY INVITED A NEW TYPE OF HEROINE 
LUX IS BEAUTIFULLY MILD 
I WOULDN'T TRUST ANYTHING ELSE 
NEW LUX LATHER WITH NATURAL OILS GIVES LULU THE LUX LOOK 
I HOPE YOU'RE USING LUX 
CELEBRITIES LIKE LULU DISPLACED THE PAMPERED HOLLYWOOD STAR 
DREAMS HAD TO BE ACHIEVABLE 
HEROINES WITHIN REACH LIKE THE CELEBRITY POP STAR 
I ASKED IF I COULD SING ABOUT NEW LUX BUT THEY SAID NO 
JUST CHOOSE YOUR OWN WORDS 
WELL I THINK NEW LUX IS FANTASTIC 
REALLY NEW IT HAS A NEW WRAPPER 
NO LONGER SOLD AS THE SOAP USED BY MOVIE STARS LUX NOW BECAME THE SOAP 
THAT CONFERRED STAR STATUS 
IF YOU'RE ASKED TO MAKE A LUX FILM YOU'RE REALLY A STAR 
SO I'M PLEASED TO INTRODUCE YOU TO NEW LUX 
THOSE PERSONALITIES WERE CLOSER TO THE REAL WORLD 
LULU WAS A LITTLE GIRL FROM GLASGOW WHO DID RATHER WELL 
AND SANDIE SHAW CAME FROM AN ORDINARY BACKGROUND 
DIANA RIGG WAS MUCH MORE OF AN ACTRESS 
BUT IN THE CASE OF THE OTHER TWO 
WE'D BE CLOSER TO THEM THAN GLAMOROUS HOLLYWOOD PERSONALITIES 
PEOPLE IDENTIFY MORE CLOSELY WITH STARS NOW 
THE CHANGING SOCIAL VALUES OF THE LATE SIXTIES PUT NEW PRESSURE 
ON ROMANCE AND MARRIAGE 
A GIRL'S TRADITIONAL PASSPORT TO HAPPINESS 
THE OBSERVER ANALYSES MARRIAGE 
IS IT WORTH THE EFFORT 
DOES YOUR HUSBAND DRIVE YOU MAD 
ARE YOUR CHILDREN GETTING A FAIR DEAL 
ARE WE THE LAST MARRIED GENERATION 
ROMANCE WAS DYING OFF AS AN IDEAL 
PROVOCATIVENESS AND INDEED SEX CAME IN 
SO RELATIONSHIPS TOOK ON A DIFFERENT PATTERN 
THE PILL CAME IN AND STARTED TO ALLOW WOMEN TO BELIEVE THEY 
COULD MAKE CHOICES OF THEIR OWN 
WERE NOT SO DEPENDENT ON THE NEED TO BE VIRGINAL AT MARRIAGE 
SO THE FOCUS WENT AWAY FROM ROMANCE 
MUCH MORE INTO ACTIVE SEXUALITY AND THE PROJECTING OF THAT 
WITH SEX FIRMLY ON THE AGENDA 
LUSTY INNUENDO PERMEATED A RANGE OF UNLIKELY PRODUCTS 
FOOD ONCE SOLD ON NUTRITION WAS NOW FLAVOURED WITH A NEW INGREDIENT 
GRANNY 
WHAT NICE COOKIES YOU'VE GOT 
GRANNY'S COOKIES SWEET LITTLE BISCUITS YOU CAN'T STOP EATING 
OH GRANNY 
M. M. M. M. M. M. M. 
CAPE GRAPES FOR AFTERS INSTEAD OF PUDDINGS KEEP ME A MAGNET TO WOMEN 
NOT WHILE I'M EATING DARLING 
M. M. M. M. M. M. M. 
IT'S LOVELY ALL SORT OF SMOO OOTH 
AND SOFT AND SUBTLE TASTING AND 
OOH I'VE GONE RIGHT OFF 
M. M. M. M. M. M. M. 
NICE 
VERY VERY NICE 
VERY COCONUT VERY COCONUT NICE 
M. M. M. M. M. M. M. VERY GOOD 
I MIGHT EVEN BUY ONE MYSELF 
THIS MARRIAGE BETWEEN FOOD AND SEX 
SPAWNED A TROUBLESOME OFFSPRING GUILT 
DARK DEMON JELLY WITH LOTS OF COLD ICE CREAM BELOW 
PURE INDULGENCE TRY IT 
IT WAS A SMALL STEP FROM FUN FOOD TO SINFUL FOOD HELLO 
I MAKE THINGS TO TEMPT PEOPLE 
SWEETS WHISKY HOT PANTS ALL MINE 
I'VE JUST FINISHED THESE BISCUITS FOR CADBURY'S 
CURLED THEN GENTLY BAKED NO ONE CAN RESIST THEM 
SO NO ONE WILL KNOW WHO MADE THEM 
I'VE CALLED THEM ANGEL TRUMPETS 
WHY DON'T YOU TRY ONE 
WE WERE BEING TEMPTED BY THESE WONDERFUL VERY SEXY FOODS 
BUT THE SIXTIES REVOLUTION HAD LED TO THE UNISEX BODY 
AND WOMEN WERE EXPECTED TO BE STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN 
SO THEY WERE PULLED APART BY THESE TWO ADVERTISING GENRES 
ONE WAS STUFFING YOUR FACE WITH INDULGENT FOOD 
AND THE OTHER WAS HAVING TO LOOK LIKE A BOY 
IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME 
ARE YOU FIGHTING THE INCH WAR 
RYVITA CAN HELP 
YOU NEED TO EAT FEWER CALORIES 
NO CRISPBREAD HAS FEWER THAN RYVITA 
RYVITA HAS A CRISP NATURAL NUTTY 
WHOLE RYE TASTE IN THE INCH WAR RYVITA HELPS YOU WIN 
WE WANT TO DISCUSS YOUR YOU KNOW WHAT 
YOU CAN'T CALL THAT PUPPY FAT WHEN YOU'RE NOT A PUPPY 
WANT SOME HELP IN KEEPING TRIM 
TRY THE WEIGHT WATCHER'S BREAKFAST WITH KELLOGG'S SPECIAL K. 
THE TASTIEST WAY TO STAY TRIM 
WOMEN WHO DIDN'T DIET WERE CALLED IRRESPONSIBLE AND WEAK WILLED 
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE ON A DIET 
SHE WOULDN'T NEED THAT IF SHE HAD A WEIGHT WATCHER'S BREAKFAST 
WONDER WHAT HER WAISTLINE WILL BE LIKE IN FIVE YEARS' TIME 
SPECIAL K. WAS SELLING A SUBSTITUTE FOR CONTROL 
THERE WAS AN ASSUMPTION THAT WOMEN WERE NOT IN CONTROL OF THEIR BODIES 
MAYBE QUITE A LOT OF THEM WEREN'T 
SPECIAL K. SAID THE PRODUCT CAN TAKE ON THAT CONTROL FOR YOU 
AND YOU CAN HAVE A NICE LIFE AND NOT WORRY 
SHE FLIES LIKE A BIRD IN THE SKY 
PRINCIPLES OF GOOD HOUSEKEEPING WERE NOW APPLIED TO THE FEMALE FIGURE 
INSTEAD OF COUNTING PENNIES WOMEN WERE ENCOURAGED TO COUNT CALORIES 
CALORIE COUNTING OFFERED A WAY 
OF RATIONALLY MEASURING WHAT WOMEN WERE EMOTIONALLY SEEKING 
WHICH WAS A BEAUTIFUL BODY 
AND A WAY OF SITTING IN THE KITCHEN AND ADDING IT ALL UP 
TO REACH A CERTAIN CONCLUSION 
SO IT WAS BRINGING IN RATIONAL VALUES 
IN AN ESSENTIALLY EMOTIONAL AREA 
BY THE MID SEVENTIES WOMEN'S BODIES FACED A NEW CHALLENGE 
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG IT WASN'T EASY TO TELL YOU FROM THE BOYS 
BUT LITTLE GIRLS GET BIGGER EVERY DAY 
THE CLEAVAGE MADE A COME BACK MUCH TO THE DELIGHT OF ADVERTISERS 
COMMERCIALS FOR DAIRY PRODUCTS COULD RARELY RESIST ASSOCIATING BREASTS 
WITH MILK TO RAISE A LAUGH 
SEEMS PRETTY CREAMY TO ME LOOK AT MY BITS OF FRUIT 
TRY SOME OF THESE PHILLY BAKED POTATOES 
PHILLY CHEESE CAKE 
MRS. HART'S MADE SOME LOVELY LIGHT CREME CARAMELS 
ALTHOUGH AMUSING TO THE YOUNG MEN OF THE INDUSTRY 
THIS ADVERTISING REINFORCED MANY WOMEN'S ANXIETIES 
THE SOLUTION TO SUCH STRESS WAS NOT A CHANGE IN ADVERTISERS' ATTITUDES 
BUT A NEW BRA 
THIS PART MOVES WITH HER BUT THE CRISS CROSS BANDS ARE SEPARATE SECURE CUPS 
THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY ITSELF 
AFFECTED THE SEVENTIES PORTRAYAL OF WOMEN 
IT HAD BEEN A SORT OF GENTLEMEN'S CLUB BUSINESS 
BUT STARTED TO ATTRACT JACK THE LADS 
THEY FOUND IT EASIER TO PORTRAY WOMEN AS SEXY AND SEX SYMBOLS 
SO YOU SAW THESE IMAGES OF WOMEN 
IT'S THOSE VIKINGS AGAIN 
PILLAGING PLUNDERING RUNNING AMOK 
PREPARE YOURSELVES OUR LEADER SAID I HAVE 
I'VE USED ONE OF SUPERSOFT'S NEW SHAMPOOS 
THEY USE GOOD OLD FASHIONED THINGS 
LIKE HONEY AND ALMONDS LEMON AND MALT VINEGAR 
OH AH H. H 
OOH 
THERE'S ONE FOR EVERY KIND OF HAIR BUT I'M NOT TELLING THE OTHER GIRLS 
IT'S EVERY GIRL FOR HERSELF 
AS A PROFESSIONAL ADVERTISER ON ONE LEVEL IT'S JUST UNFORGIVABLE 
BECAUSE IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PRODUCT 
IN THE MIDDLE THERE'S A NATURAL INGREDIENT STORY 
BUT WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH VIKINGS TAKING A VILLAGE BY STORM 
I'VE NO IDEA 
BUT THE WHOLE ASPECT OF PLAYING ON RAPE AND PILLAGE 
BEING SOMETHING THAT WOMEN WANT 
IS UNACCEPTABLE AND UNBELIEVABLE 
AH H. H 
THESE VERY SEXY ADS WERE NOT REAL ABERRATIONS 
IT WAS THE AD BUSINESS PICKING UP ON CURRENT IMAGES 
IT WAS THE SUN PROGRAMMES LIKE BENNY HILL 
THERE WAS A PROGRAMME CALLED FUTTOCK'S END BY RONNIE BARKER 
WHICH SHOWED THE MAID IN THE SCANTY BLACK DRESS AND SO ON 
SO YOU PICKED UP ON THESE IMAGES 
BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER THE ADS INSULTED WOMEN 
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T ASK THEM 
AH H. H 
ADVERTISING WENT THROUGH A RECESSION LIKE EVERYONE ELSE 
BUDGETS WERE CUT BACK PARTICULARLY MARKET RESEARCH BUDGETS 
AS WE LOST TOUCH WITH THE CONSUMER 
WE LOST TOUCH WITH OUR PORTRAYALS OF THE CONSUMER 
ALL ABOUT WOMEN STARTS TOMORROW IN THE SUNDAY TIMES 
AND ASKS HOW DO YOU SEE YOURSELF 
THE MEDIA HAVE SPECULATED ON THIS FOR A DECADE 
WHAT'S ALL THIS I HEAR ABOUT WOMEN'S LIB 
IT'S SOMETHING TO DO WITH WOMEN'S RIGHTS 
WOMEN'S RIGHTS THEY'VE GOT BOATS HUSBANDS WHAT MORE DO THEY WANT 
AS FAR AS I CAN GATHER THEY'RE NOT TOO KEEN ON THE IDEA OF HUSBANDS 
SOUNDS LIKE LOTS OF OLD MADAM TO ME 
WOMEN'S LIB IS HAPPENING NOW 
HOW WILL IT CHANGE OUR LIVES READ THE OBSERVER TOMORROW 
THE EARLY SEVENTIES WAS VERY FRIGHTENING FOR MEN 
WOMEN'S LIB SEEMED LIKE A SERIOUS THREAT 
AND I THINK WOMEN WERE CONFUSED ABOUT LIBERATION 
IN PARTICULAR SEXUAL LIBERATION 
THEY HAD LEARNT NOT TO HANG ON TO THEIR SELF RESPECT 
AND THEIR VIRGINITY 
THEY HAD TO BE SEXUALLY AVAILABLE 
BUT THEY HADN'T LEARNT WHETHER THEY HAD A RIGHT TO CHOOSE 
TO WHOM THEY WERE AVAILABLE 
I'M TESTING YARDLEY LIPSTICK 
YARDLEY SUKI PEARL LIPSTICK 
IT'S VERY GOOD PEARLY SHINY 
TASTES SO NICE SMOOTH LUSTROUS 
AND THAT WAS JUST THE SEA PINK 
GET TESTED TODAY 
SUN PEACH 
EVEN BABYCHAM REPLACED ROMANCE WITH EASY VIRTUE 
DOESN'T THAT LOOK LIKE A GOOD TIME 
UH UH SORRY DARLING YOU'VE GOT WORK TO DO I HAVE TOO 
BABYCHAM'S GOT SPARKLE BABYCHAM'S GOT LIFE 
WE WANTED A SITUATION WHICH WAS DIFFERENT 
WITH A MAN WHO WAS A SYMBOL OF MALE PROWESS 
A SEX SYMBOL IF YOU LIKE 
SO HERE WE ARE LIVING OUR LIFE OUR OWN WAY 
AND I DON'T CARE WHAT MOTHER THINKS 
WHETHER WOMEN THOUGHT THAT WAY I DON'T KNOW 
BUT WE THOUGHT IT WAS A SEVENTIES FEMALE FANTASY 
DOESN'T THAT LOOK LIKE A GOOD TIME IT WAS A MALE FANTASY 
HOWEVER WOMEN AT THAT STAGE 
WOULD NOT HAVE FOUGHT VERY HARD AGAINST THAT 
SO THEY WERE PARTLY THEIR OWN WORST ENEMY IN THAT THEY WOULD ALLOW 
THIS MALE FANTASISING 
AND THEY ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE THE OBJECT OF 
IT'S NOT AGGRESSION BUT THE MALE PICK UP 
THERE'S A FRAGRANCE THAT'S HERE TO STAY 
THEY CALL IT CHARLIE 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE THE AMERICAN FRAGRANCE CHARLIE WAS LAUNCHED IN BRITAIN 
ITS IMAGE OF A STRIDENT INDEPENDENT WOMAN WAS CLEARLY LONG OVERDUE 
CHARLIE THE KIND OF FRAGRANCE THAT'S GONNA SAY CHARLIE 
NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO CHARLIE 
SHE WAS ASPIRATIONAL BUT SHE WAS INDEPENDENT HER OWN PERSON 
SHE DIDN'T NEED THE KIND OF MALE APPROBATION 
PEOPLE IN ADS SEEMED TO NEED IN THE FIFTIES AND EARLY SIXTIES 
SO IT WAS SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE IT WAS DIFFERENT 
A DIFFERENT FRAGRANCE THAT THINKS YOUR WAY 
AND THEY CALL IT CHARLIE 
CHARLIE SPAWNED MANY IMITATORS WITH HEROINES WEARING TROUSERS 
NOT SO LONG AGO YOU WEREN'T THIS FREE 
MAX FACTOR WOULDN'T HAVE MADE A PERFUME LIKE BLASE 
DINNER RIGHT NOW I'M NOT DRESSED FOR IT CAN I COME AS I AM 
THE SIMPLE ASSUMPTION WAS THAT WOMEN'S INDEPENDENCE 
COULD BE EXPRESSED THROUGH MEN'S FASHION 
BUT THIS ADVERTISING WAS STILL ABOUT PULLING A MAN 
AN ASSUMPTION THAT WOULD BE CHALLENGED 
PUT ON A HAPPY FACE 
WHAT YOU SEE IS A WOMAN ENJOYING 
PAINTING HER FACE NOT FOR A MAN 
BUT TO EXPRESS HER PERSONALITY 
IN THAT ONE COMMERCIAL SHE'S BEING COQUETTISH AGGRESSIVE 
AND HAVING A LAUGH 
WHICH WOMEN DO A LOT 
WE HAD BEEN THROUGH THE PUNK ERA 
THAT FASHION GAVE US PERMISSION TO PAINT WOMEN'S FACES THAT WAY 
THOUGH A LANDMARK TO WOMEN 
THIS PUNK STYLE IMPROVISATION 
WOULD BE CHALLENGED BY THE NEW EIGHTIES CONCERNS 
TAKE CONTROL WITH NEW SUNSILK STYLING MOUSSE 
AND YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH YOUR HAIR 
THE STRUGGLE NOW WAS ABOUT COMPETING WITH MEN AND PERSONAL CONTROL 
NOW HAVE THE STYLE YOU WANT 
I'M A FASHION MODEL RIGHT ON TOP 
ALWAYS BUSY NO TIME TO STOP 
I DRINK INSTANT BOVRIL WHEN MY BODY'S ON GO 
ONE CUP TWENTY CALORIES THAT'S LOW 
THIS BUSY NEW HEROINE WAS ALWAYS ON THE MOVE ALWAYS MAKING CONNECTIONS 
DAVID 
THAT WOMAN THE ONE YOU HAD BREAKFAST WITH 
WON'T BE ABLE TO MAKE IT TOMORROW OH 
YOU'LL BE SEEING LESS OF HER HOW COME 
OH YOU KNOW FLYING HERE YOU GOT THE JOB 
ONE DEAL AFTER ANOTHER 
YOU USUALLY SEE THE EXECUTIVE WOMAN 
DEFINED BY HER LOOKS SLICK TOGETHER AND NOT OVERTLY SEXY 
AND BY THE FACT THAT SHE'S ON THE MOVE 
GOING ON AN AEROPLANE OR SOMETHING 
VIRGIN ATLANTIC VOTED THE BUSINESS PERSON'S FAVOURITE AIRLINE 
YOU DON'T SEE HER AT WORK IN THE OFFICE DOING REAL THINGS 
THE REASON IS THE AGENCIES DON'T KNOW HOW TO SHOW HER 
OR WHAT REAL PROPS TO USE 
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT SORT OF WOMAN WILL TURN ON 
OR OFF THE FEMALE VIEWER 
WHAT'S THIS A NEW BANK ACCOUNT 
VERY TRENDY QUITE USEFUL TOO 
FREE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OVERDRAFT WHAT'LL YOU DO WITH THAT 
I'LL THINK OF SOMETHING 
INTEREST ON YOUR CURRENT ACCOUNT 
KILLING BANK CHARGES NO FIXED FEE INSTEAD 
THE LISTENING BANK STRIKES AGAIN 
ARE WE GOING SOMEWHERE NO WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE 
I'M GOING SOMEWHERE SUE 
THEN SHE LEAVES AND HE'S DUMBSTRUCK 
COS SHE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT 
WATCH THAT IN AN AUDIENCE NOT JUST T. V. AT HOME AND THE WOMEN CHEER 
THE MEN LOOK VERY UPTIGHT 
ONE WONDERS IF THAT CHEERING IS HELPFUL 
BECAUSE IT THREATENS THE STATUS QUO MOST PEOPLE WANT 
BUT THREATENING THE STATUS QUO HAS BECOME FASHIONABLE 
THE ROW HAS COME TO SYMBOLISE A WOMAN'S FIGHT FOR EQUALITY 
LOVE IS THE SWEETEST THING 
THIS CAR DOES HAVE FIVE GEARS WANT TO DRIVE NO SURE POSITIVE 
YOU WON'T BE NEEDING THE CAR TODAY THEN THE CAR 
ARGUMENT IS SHORTHAND FOR PARITY 
THE IDEA THAT THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP IN WHICH THE WOMAN 
CAN GIVE AS GOOD AS SHE GETS 
BECAUSE SHE'S JUST AS IMPORTANT AND SHE'S A WAGE EARNER TOO 
HAVING A ROW IN WHICH IT'S EVEN STEVEN 
YOU CAN SET THAT UP IN TWENTY SECONDS 
BUT ROWS SOMETIMES LEAD TO DIVORCES 
AS YOUR SOLICITOR I ASK YOU TO BE REASONABLE 
REASONABLE I WANT EVERYTHING HIS LORDSHIP'S GOT 
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A GOOD THING THAT THE EIGHTIES HEROINE WANTS INDEPENDENCE 
FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE THAT IS 
BUT WHAT SEEMS TO HAVE HAPPENED 
IS THAT SHE HAS BECOME OBSESSED WITH THE POWER GAME 
RATHER THAN WANTING INDEPENDENCE FOR POWER OVER HERSELF 
SHE WANTS POWER OVER OTHERS 
HIS LORDSHIP GIVES YOU HIS LONDON MANSION 
AND HIS COUNTRY ESTATE 
HE'D JUST LIKE TO KEEP THE BUDGIE NO BUDGIE ACKROYD 
EVERYONE IS GOING THROUGH CHANGES 
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON 
AND EVERYBODY CHANGES PLACES 
BUT THE WORLD STILL CARRIES ON 
IF THIS MODERN HEROINE SEEMS UNLUCKY IN LOVE 
ADVERTISERS HAVE GIVEN HER AN EMOTIONAL SUBSTITUTE THE CAR 
IN THE MID AND LATE EIGHTIES THEY STARTED SHOWING CARS AS BEING 
AN ESSENTIAL WORKING TOOL PART OF A WOMAN'S LIFE 
THE CAR WOULD NEVER LET HER DOWN 
THOUGH MEN WERE SECOND RATE 
SO THE CAR WAS THE KEY LOVER IN THE LIFE OF A RATHER ISOLATED 
UNHAPPY CAREER WOMAN 
WOMEN ARE OFTEN QUITE FRIGHTENED BY THAT POWER BROKING YUPPIE 
CAREER ORIENTATED WOMAN 
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT COMMERCIALS WHERE THAT IS USED 
IT'S INTIMATED THAT SHE HAS NO MAN IN SIGHT 
NOR DOES SHE HAVE A DECENT RELATIONSHIP A SENSE OF HUMOUR 
AND SHE ISN'T A HUMAN BEING 
THEY'RE SAYING I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT 
HOWEVER INDEPENDENT THEY MADE HER 
ONE PROBLEM CONTINUED TO TORMENT THE ADVERTISERS OF THE EIGHTIES 
WHAT TO DO ABOUT ROMANCE 
SORRY I MISSED YOU CALL YOU AT EIGHT 
WOMEN WHO CHOOSE TO PLEASE THEMSELVES 
CHOOSE A SOAP THAT GIVES PLEASURE CAMAY 
THE CAMAY FRAGRANCE IS GENTLE 
ITS LATHER FEELS MORE LIKE A CREAM THAN A LATHER 
IT LEAVES YOUR SKIN FEELING SOFT ALL OVER RICH CREAMY CAMAY 
FOR WOMEN WHO CHOOSE TO PLEASE THEMSELVES 
THE CAMAY COMMERCIAL WAS WRITTEN BY AN ALL FEMALE TEAM 
IT ATTEMPTED TO SHOW A WOMAN AS TOTALLY INDEPENDENT 
PROBABLY THE WOMEN WHO WROTE THAT COMMERCIAL WERE SO INDEPENDENT 
THAT THEY COULD BEHAVE THAT WAY 
BUT WOMEN SAID EVEN A GROTESQUE MAN IS BETTER THAN A BATH ALONE 
CAMAY RESTORED A TRADITIONAL MALE TOUCH CAMAY LEAVES MY SKIN SO SOFT 
AND BEAUTIFUL WE'LL MISS THE PARTY WHAT PARTY 
I THINK IN THE EIGHTIES THE WAY WOMEN ARE PRESENTED 
IS TRUE TO THE ROOT TENSION GOING ON IN SOCIETY 
WOMEN THEMSELVES THESE DAYS ARE NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER THEY WANT 
THE INDEPENDENT FINANCIALLY O. K. WAY 
OR WHETHER THEY WANT TO HANG ON TO BUT WHERE'S MY MAN 
BUT SHOWING HER TRYING TO GET HER MAN POSES PROBLEMS 
FOR CONTEMPORARY ADVERTISERS I'LL BE AN HOUR 
NICK YES GIVE ME TWENTY MINUTES 
ALL SEXUAL FANTASIES ARE A BIT DIFFICULT IN THE LATE EIGHTIES 
BECAUSE THERE'S AN AIDS VIEW 
THE AIDS VIEW OF SEX COLOURS THE WAY PEOPLE SEE 
ALL KINDS OF REPRESENTATIONS OF SEX 
SOME ALARM BELLS RING SOONER 
SOMETIMES YOU NEED A LITTLE SOMETIMES YOU NEED A LOT 
THE PREDATORY WOMAN IS SOME WAY DOWN THAT LIST NONETHELESS 
SHE'S STARTING TO SHOW UP 
FOR INSTANCE IN ONE OF THE ANTI AIDS COMMERCIALS 
IT'S QUITE LATE 
WILL YOU STAY 
WHICH MEANS THAT ADS WHICH SHOW PREDATORY WOMEN 
EXCEPT IN A JOKEY ROLE REVERSAL WAY 
ARE BEGINNING TO BE DIFFICULT 
CONFRONTED WITH THIS PROBLEM SOME ADVERTISERS ARE PREDICTING 
A RENEWED CELEBRATION OF MARRIAGE AND SECURITY 
IF THEY'RE RIGHT DE BEERS CAN ONLY BE THE WINNERS 
THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO SHOW YOUR WIFE YOU LOVE HER 
BUT NONE LASTS AS LONG AS A DIAMOND ETERNITY RING 
AS WE MOVE INTO THE NINETIES 
MANY WOMEN ARE LOOKING FOR STABILITY FOR ROMANCE 
FOR GOOD OLD FASHIONED VALUES 
A LOT OF WOMEN'S FANTASIES ARE MADE UP OF THOSE ELEMENTS 
BUT THEY'RE LOOKING IN EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS 
OF THE MANY FANTASIES NOW AVAILABLE TO ADVERTISERS 
MONOGAMOUS ROMANCE SEEMS PARTICULARLY ELIGIBLE 
FOR A FUTURE STILL CLOUDED BY THE THREAT OF AIDS 
MY BABY DON'T CARE FOR SHOWS 
BUT AT THE CLOSE OF THE DECADE 
COMMERCIALS LIKE THIS MUST CONTINUE WRESTLING WITH CONFLICTING DESIRES 
ASSERTION AND INDEPENDENCE MUST STILL BE SQUARED WITH ROMANCE 
AND MALE APPROVAL 
MY BABY DON'T CARE FOR CARS AND RACES 
MY BABY DON'T CARE FOR HIGH TOWN PLACES 
I THINK ONE COULD INTERPRET IT SIMPLY AS SHOWING A WOMAN 
WHO REALLY HAS THE FREEDOM AND THE RIGHT AND THE CONFIDENCE 
TO CHOOSE ON HER OWN GROUNDS 
SO SHE MAY REJECT CONVENTIONAL SYMBOLS 
OF MALE POWER AND WEALTH 
AND ALSO REJECT THE ATTRACTIONS OF A SIMPLE FLING 
BUT AT THE END COMING TO CONFRONT ON HER OWN TERMS 
THIS VERY ROBUST SYMBOL OF MALE POTENCY 
SHARE THE FANTASY 
I THINK THE FANTASIES THAT ARE USED AND THE ASPIRATIONS IMPOSED 
AFFECT PEOPLE MORE THAN THEY KNOW 
WHEN YOU RESEARCH COMMERCIALS WITH WOMEN 
THEY SAY THEY CAN KEEP A DECENT DISTANCE FROM ADVERTISING 
AND REAL LIFE ISN'T LIKE THAT 
BUT CUMULATIVELY SUCH COMMERCIALS ARE ON EVERY TWENTY MINUTES 
OF COURSE IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO HOW THEY SEE THEMSELVES IT MUST 
YOUR TOWN 
YOUR STREET 
YOUR HOME 
IT'S ALL IN OUR DATABASE 
NEW TECHNOLOGY MEANS IT'S EASY TO PAY YOUR T. V. LICENCE 
AND IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE IF YOU DON'T
