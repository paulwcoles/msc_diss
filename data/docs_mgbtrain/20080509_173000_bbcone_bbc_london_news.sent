TONIGHT THE VULNERABLE PEOPLE WHO FEAR A NEW IMMIGRATION RULES WILL 
LEAVE THEM WITHOUT CARERS AND THE 
END OF AN ERA AS RICHARD HILL ONE 
OF ENGLAND'S RUGBY GREATS HANGS UP 
HIS BOOTS PLUS THE WEEKEND'S 
WEATHER FROM PETER COCKCROFT IN A 
RATHER UNUSUAL GARDEN 
HELLO IT WAS A HUGE EXPLOSION 
WHICH LEFT ONE PERSON DEAD AND TWO 
MORE INJURED AND THREE HOUSES 
DESTROYED THE MYSTERY DEEPENED 
TODAY INTO WHAT CAUSED IT 
DETECTIVES NOW SAY THEY ARE TRYING 
TO TRACE A GROUP OF TEENAGERS SEEN 
HANGING AROUND THE AREA THEY WANT 
TO FIND OUT ABOUT A PURPLE LIQUID 
POURED THROUGH THE LETTERBOX OF ONE 
OF THE HOUSES 
IT'S A PAINSTAKING TASK FORENSIC 
OFFICERS ARE SIFTING THROUGH WHAT 
IS LEFT OF THREE HOUSES BLOWN APART 
IN STANLEY STREET IN HARROW BUT 
THEY ARE ALSO CHECKING EACH STREET 
SURROUNDING THE BLAST GAS WAS 
THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF 
THE EXPLOSION BUT POLICE NOW 
BELIEVE IT WAS A SERIES OF EVENTS 
EARLIER THAT MORNING WHICH MAY 
PROVE CRUCIAL TO THE INVESTIGATION 
AT ABOUT ONE THOUSAND FIFTY ON WEDNESDAY MORNING 
THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL WHO LIVED 
UPSTAIRS AT NUMBER TWENTY ONE DIALLED NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
SHE SAYS THERE WAS A SMALL GROUP OF 
PEOPLE MAINLY GIRLS AND YOUNG WHO 
WERE CAUSING HER TROUBLE A COUPLE 
OF MINUTES LATER SHE RAN BACK TO 
SAY THEY HAD GONE AWAY ABOUT THE 
SAME TIME A QUANTITY OF PURPLE 
LIQUID WAS POURED THROUGH THE 
LETTERBOX AT NUMBER TWENTY ONE ABOUT TEN 
HOURS LATER 
LIQUID COULD CAUSE THE DESTRUCTION 
OF THREE HOUSES 
I REALLY DON'T 
KNOW WE'RE SPEAKING TO SCIENTISTS 
AND EXPERTS IT WAS DESCRIBED TO US 
AS LOOKING LIKE RYE BEEN A THAT 
SORT OF COLOUR PURPLE COLOURED 
AND IT HAD A DISTINCTIVE SMELL 
RIBENA PAUL REDMOND'S HOUSE IS 
DIRECTLY NEXT DOOR TO WHERE THE 
BLAST OCCURRED HE DOES NOT KNOW 
WHEN HE WILL BE ALLOWED TO MOVE 
BACK IN 
I HAVE NOT HAD ANY WORD 
FROM THE FIRE BRIGADE OR THE POLICE 
TO SAY THAT MY HOUSE WOULD BE 
TUMBLING DOWN SO I HAD TO MAKE MY 
OWN INQUIRIES 
POLICE SAY THE 
SEARCH WILL TAKE UNTIL NEXT WEEK 
BUT WITH THE PURPLE LIQUID 
UNIDENTIFIED AND THE GROUP OF 
TEENAGERS STILL TO BE TRACED THEIR 
JOB WILL BE FAR FROM SIMPLE LOTS 
MORE TO COME INCLUDING IT IS 
GREEN AND TRANQUIL AND IT'S ABOUT 
TO BECOME ONE OF LONDON'S LARGEST 
BURIAL GROUNDS L. WILL BE 
EXPLAINING WHY PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING 
TO EPPING FOREST AS THEIR FINAL 
RESTING PLACE CHOOSING EPPING 
FOREST 
CAMPAIGNERS CLAIM NEW IMMIGRATION 
RULES COULD LEAVE HUNDREDS OF 
ELDERLY PEOPLE IN LONDON WITHOUT 
THEIR LIVE IN CARERS THE HOME 
OFFICE SAYS THE POLICY WOULD MEAN 
MORE BRITISH PEOPLE GETTING THE 
JOBS BUT THERE ARE FEARS THAT ONE 
CONSEQUENCE COULD BE GREATER 
NUMBERS OF OLD PEOPLE BEING FORCED 
INTO RESIDENTIAL CARE 
CAN I PUT TUNER THE OXYGEN TO GET 
YOU BETTER YES 
CAN I PUT YOU 
NOW JOSIE HAS BEEN THE LIVE IN 
CARER FOR THIS LADY FOR MORE THAN 
TWO YEARS PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE 
IMMIGRATION RULES WOULD MEAN THAT 
SHE COULD ONLY STAY HERE FOR SIX 
MONTHS MONTHS LIKE MY OWN FAMILY I TREAT HER 
LIKE MY OWN FAMILY 
CAN IT BE 
CHALLENGING SOMETIMES 
YEAH BUT I 
TRY MY 
B. ST 
WE HAD CARERS COMING 
IN IN THE MORNING AND THEN AT 
LUNCHTIME SHE DIDN'T GET TO KNOW 
THEM SHE NEEDS PEOPLE HERE AND 
JOE'S A HAS BECOME LIKE ONE OF THE 
FAMILY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO MY 
MOTHER JOSE TATAYA HAS BECOME 
LIKE ONE OF THE FAMILY 
THE FAMILY 
ARGUE THE MOVE WILL CREATE A 
SHORTAGE AND THAT SOME CARERS MAY 
END UP ON LOW WAGES PAYING NO TAX 
OR NATIONAL INSURANCE 
I THINK THE 
GOVERNMENT IS NAIVE IF THEY ASSUME 
THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LEAVE THE 
COUNTRY AND IT WILL GO BACK TO HOW 
IT WAS PRE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THEY WILL GO 
UNDERGROUND THEY WILL BECOME 
ILLEGAL AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF 
EMPLOYERS OUT THERE WHO WILL BE 
MORE THAN HAPPY TO EMPLOY 
UNOFFICIALLY THEIR HELPERS THE THE THAT MIGHT MEAN A DROP IN WAGES 
JOSE TATAYA EARNS MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED A 
WEEK WITH NO RENT OR FOOD TO PAY 
HER EMPLOYERS COVER HER TAX AND 
INSURANCE THE HOME OFFICE SAYS THE 
REASON IT HAS INTRODUCED THIS NEW 
AUSTRALIAN STYLE POINTS SYSTEM IS 
TO GIVE BRITISH AND E. U. WORKERS THE 
FIRST CRACK OF THE WHIP IT WILL BE 
BROUGHT INTO FORCE OVER THE NEXT TWELVE 
MONTHS AND IT WILL MEAN THERE WILL 
BE AROUND FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEWER FOREIGN 
WORKERS IN LONDON EVERY YEAR MRS. 
BLAKE IS DETERMINED TO STAY AT HOME 
AS LONG AS SHE CAN HER FAMILY SAY 
THAT SIMPLY WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE 
WITHOUT THE HELP OF JOSE TATAYA 
THE LAW CAUGHT UP TODAY WITH SOME 
OF THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
RECENT SPATE OF TEENAGE MURDERS TEN 
TEENAGERS WERE SENTENCED OVER THE 
MERGER OF SIXTEEN YEAR OLD KODJO YENGA 
AND FOURTEEN YEAR OLD PAUL ERHAHON BUT 
IN ANOTHER EXTRAORDINARY TRIAL THE 
JURY FOUND ANOTHER TEENAGER GUILTY 
OF SHOOTING DEAD A YOUTH WORKER 
DESPITE THERE BEING NO FORENSIC 
EVIDENCE IN A MAJOR COUP FOR THE 
MET THE CONVENTION WAS ACHIEVED 
BECAUSE FOUR YOUNG WITNESSES WERE 
PREPARED TO GIVE EVIDENCE IN COURT 
BREAKING DOWN THE SO CALLED RULE 
OF SILENCE 
HIS NAME OF AN ACE AND FOSTER BUT 
HE WAS KNOWN TO HIS FRIENDS UNDER 
HIS NICKNAME HIS NAME WAS NATHAN 
FOSTER THIS IS WHERE HE WAS SHOT 
DEAD LAST SUMMER ANOTHER TEENAGER 
FIRED SIX BULLETS INTO HIM AS HE 
WAS SITTING ON A WALL WITH FRIENDS 
HE WAS A YOUTH WORKER HE DIED IN 
WHAT THE PROSECUTION DESCRIBED AS A 
COLD BLOODED PREMEDITATED ACT OF 
REVENGE TODAY AN OLD BAILEY JURY 
FOUND HIS KILLER GUILTY NATHAN'S 
FAMILY WERE RELIEVED IT WAS ALL 
OVER THEY ARE NOW LEFT WITH JUST 
MEMORIES 
HE WAS HARD WORKING MEMORIES FRIENDLY VERY LOYAL JUST MY 
LITTLE BROTHER JUST EVERYTHING TO 
ME 
NATHAN WAS KILLED BECAUSE OF AN ME OR ARGUMENT OVER A GOLD CHAIN 
NEITHER THE MURDER WEAPON NOR THE 
SCOOTER HAVE EVER BEEN FOUND IN 
FACT NO HARD EVIDENCE WAS 
PRESENTED TO THE JURY APART FROM 
THE COURAGE OF THE PROSECUTION 
WITNESSES FOUR OF THEM TEENAGERS 
WHO KNEW THE KILO IDENTIFIED HIM 
AT THE OLD BAILEY AS PULLING THE 
TRIGGER KNEW THE KILLER THEY 
WERE GIVEN FULL WITNESS PROTECTION 
THEIR VOICES WERE DISGUISED THEIR 
NAMES WERE CHANGED AND THEY WERE 
HIDDEN BEHIND A SCREEN IN COURT 
HIS LAWYERS AND THE DEFENDANT WERE 
UNABLE TO SEE THEM 
THEY HAVE COME 
TO COURT GIVEN EVIDENCE ASSISTED 
THE POLICE THEY HAVE DONE THEIR 
COMMUNITY PROUD NOW THEY HAVE 
REINTEGRATED INTO THE COMMUNITY 
BUT DESPITE SPECIAL PROTECTION FOR 
KEY WITNESSES AND OTHER SIMILAR 
CASES FAILED TO BE SOLVED JAMES 
SMARTT FORD ALSO LOST HIS LIFE ONE 
OF TWENTY SIX TEENAGERS IN LONDON WHO LOST 
THEIR LIVES LAST YEAR HE WAS SHOT 
AT THE ICE RINK IN SHEPPERTON THREE HUNDRED 
PEOPLE WERE THERE BUT NO ONE HAS 
YET BEEN CHARGED STREATHAM 
NATHAN LOVED HORSES AND 
VOLUNTEERED TO WORK AT THESE 
STABLES IN WEST LONDON NATHAN NATHAN WOULD ALWAYS BE THERE HE TOOK 
MAXIMUM ADVANTAGE AND HE ACHIEVED 
A LOT IN HIS SHORT LIFE 
THIS TRIAL 
SHOWED THAT FOUR YOUNG WITNESSES 
FELT CONFIDENT ENOUGH THAT THEIR 
IDENTITIES WOULD BE PROTECTED IN 
SO MANY OF THESE MURDER CASES IN 
PARTICULAR WITH GUN CRIME 
DETECTIVES FACE A WALL OF SILENCE 
PEOPLE WHO MAY KNOW SOMETHING OFTEN 
DON'T COME FORWARD FOR NATHAN 
FOSTER'S FAMILY THOUGH TODAY 
THEY GOT JUSTICE 
SO THE MET THERE WINNING TRUST TO 
TACKLE YOUTH CRIME BUT IT APPEARS 
THAT ANOTHER TACTIC COULD BE HAVING 
THE REVERSE EFFECT IN SOUTH LONDON 
WHERE CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS FOURTEEN ARE 
BEING STOPPED SEARCHED AND 
PHOTOGRAPHED BY OFFICERS WHAT HAVE 
PEOPLE THERE BEEN SAYING ABOUT 
THIS THIS THIS LATEST TACTIC CAME TO LIGHT 
DURING MONTHLY POLICE COMMUNITY 
MEETING THAT WAS HELD LAST NIGHT 
AND THIS IS THE FRONT PAGE OF THE 
LOCAL NEWSPAPER YES IT IS CAUSING 
CONSTERNATION AMONGST YOUNG PEOPLE 
I SPOKE TO THE MOTHER WHO WAS FOURTEEN 
YEAR OLD SON WAS STOPPED SHE SAID 
POLICE WERE LOOKING FOR A BOY WHO 
FITTED HIS DESCRIPTION SHE 
DESCRIBED WHAT HAPPENED 
THEY ASKED HIM WHEN WAS THE LAST 
ARRESTED HE SAID HE NEVER EVER 
WAS THEY THEN CONTINUED TO SAY 
WELL WE NEED TO TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH 
AREN'T YOU GOING TO SMILE FOR THE 
CAMERA I WAS PRETTY SHOCKED AND 
QUITE DISMAYED BECAUSE I THOUGHT TO 
MYSELF QUITE AT WHY WOULD YOU TAKE 
A PHOTOGRAPH OF YOUNGSTER AGED 
FOURTEEN AND HE HAS NEVER GOT INTO ANY 
TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE BEFORE HE 
IS A LAW ABIDING CITIZEN HE HAS 
NEVER BEEN ARRESTED WHY WOULD YOU 
TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH 
NOW SHE RANG 
POLICE AND THEY TOLD HER THAT HIS 
PHOTO WOULD BE KEPT ON A 
SURVEILLANCE DATA BASE COMMUNITY 
RELATIONS HERE WITH POLICE HAVE 
BEEN RATHER STRAINED L. SPOKE TO 
THE CHAIR OF THE COMMUNITY POLICE 
GROUP HAS SAID THIS REVOLUTION 
COULD DAMAGE THE ONCE AGAIN 
REVELATION 
THAT LED TO YEARS OF REVELATION BITTERNESS AND UNHAPPINESS IN 
LAMBETH PEOPLE HAVE WORKED 
EXTREMELY HARD IN LAMBETH TO FORM A 
GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR LOCAL 
POLICE AND I THINK WE HAVE DONE 
THAT EVERYBODY TOGETHER AND THERE 
WAS AN UNEASY FEELING THAT THAT 
THOSE YEARS OF WORK NOW ARE BEING 
UNDERMINED UNDERMINED SOME LITTLE PEOPLE I HAVE SPOKE TO 
SAY THEY DO NOT MIND STOP AND 
SEARCH IF IT IS PROVED THAT CRIME 
IS FALLING LOCAL PEOPLE LAMBETH 
POLICE TOLD ME THAT THEY DO NOT 
HAVE EXACT FIGURES FOR THE NUMBER 
OF PHOTOS ON THE DATABASE BUT THEY 
CLAIM THAT CRIME IN THE AREA 
THANKS TO OVERT PHOTOGRAPHY HAS 
BEEN REDUCED 
NOW IT IS BORIS JOHNSON'S FIRST 
WEEK AS MAYOR HE HAS BEEN BUSY 
ENTERTAINING HIS NEW YORK 
COUNTERPART WHILE MICHAEL 
BLOOMBERG MAKES HIS WHISTLE STOP 
VISIT A NEWLY THE NEWLY ELECTED 
LONDON ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HAVE BEEN 
GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR NEW 
SURROUNDINGS IT SOUNDS LIKE IT HAS 
BEEN A BUSY DAY YES AND THE SUN 
HAS BEEN SHINING FOR BORIS JOHNSON 
ALL WEEK HE HAS BEEN GETTING HIS 
FEET FIRMLY UNDER THE TABLE AND 
WHILE THE JOB HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN 
AND WE ARE TOLD THAT STRATEGISTS 
ARE GOING TO BE WORKING HERE OVER 
THE WEEKEND TO PLAN HIS NEXT MOVES 
THERE IS BROAD AGREEMENT IT HAS 
BEEN A GOOD WEEK AND YESTERDAY HE 
WAS PLAYING HOST TO HIS FIRST 
INTERNATIONAL GUEST GOOD MORNING 
BORIS JOHNSON WAS BORN IN NEW YORK 
AND IS BORN WITH THE CITY JUST GOT 
STRONGER 
IT IS A CRYSTAL APPLE STRONGER THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH 
A GIFT 
FROM MR. BLOOMBERG AND FROM THE 
HOST THIS SHOW IT WITH A CHUTE MAP 
ON THE FRONT PERHAPS NOT FOR EVERY 
OCCASION TUBE MAP THEY TALKED 
TACTICS AND NEW YORK'S BOSS 
ADVISED THE NEW BOY TO KEEP FOCUSED 
ON WHAT LONDONERS CARE ABOUT AND 
ALSO TO BE VISIBLE AS IF THERE WAS 
ANY CHANCE OF ANYTHING ELSE WE 
HARDLY THOUGHT THIS MAN WOULD BE 
VISIBLE TODAY BUT KEN LIVINGSTONE 
TURNED UP TO WATCH THE FIRST 
ASSEMBLY MEETING HE IS VOWING TO 
MAKE IT A REGULAR OCCURRENCE 
I MY 
ENTIRE LIFE HAS BEEN ORGANISED 
AROUND THE GOVERNANCE AND POLITICS 
OF LONDON I AM ACTUALLY INTERESTED 
IN IT 
OUT SIDE A SMALL PROTEST 
ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF THE B. N. P. 
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHEN THE SESSION 
WAS OVER THE NEW MAYOR MET THE NEW 
ASSEMBLY AND THEN SURELY 
UNEXPECTED FOUND HIMSELF HERE AT 
CITY HALL CONVERSING WITH THE MAN 
HE HAD TURFED OUT JUST A WEEK AGO 
SO HOW WOULD YOU ASSESS BORIS 
JOHNSON'S FIRST WEEK IN THE JOB 
THE THING HE AND HIS TEAM WILL BE 
PLEASED IT HAS BEEN A BRISK START 
A BRISK PACE I THINK ALCOHOL 
HAS BEEN BANNED FROM THE TUBE AND 
YOUTH CRIME HAS BEEN MADE A 
PRIORITY HE HAS GOT A FEEL FOR THE 
PUBLIC SIDE OF HIS ROLE BUT AT THE 
SAME TIME THERE IS HUGE AMOUNT 
OF WORK GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES 
TO BED DOWN THIS ADMINISTRATION 
NOT LEAST TRYING TO FIND SEVERAL 
MORE KEY ADVISERS TO FILL KEY 
POLICY POSTS 
WHAT HAS NOT WORKED 
DO YOU THINK 
ONE NOTE OF DISCORD 
HAS BEEN HIS ANNOUNCEMENT OF THIS 
AUDIT PANEL TO INVESTIGATE THE 
SPENDING OF THE LONDON DEVELOPMENT 
AGENCY HE PROMISED THIS WOULD BE 
AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW BUT THE 
NATURE OF THIS PANEL LOOKS VERY 
CONSERVATIVE LEANING THERE ARE TWO 
COUNCIL LEADERS THE TORY 
BUSINESSMAN AND CERTAINLY LABOUR 
AND THE OTHER PARTIES ARE SAYING 
SAYING HOW CAN THIS BE A FAIR 
ASSESSMENT IS IT REALLY 
INDEPENDENT SO HOSTILITIES HAVE 
FINALLY RESUMED HERE 
COMING UP THE FIRST TRIP TO 
WEMBLEY FOR THE CLUB OWNED BY ITS 
FANS 
IT IS BEST KNOWN AS THE CIRCUIT 
WHERE TOP GEAR TESTS ITS CARS BUT 
NOW DUNSFOLD PARK NEAR GODALMING IN 
SURREY IS SET TO BE TRANSFORMED AND 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY THE 
PLAN IS TO CREATE AN ECO TOWN WITH 
TWO THOUSAND CARBON NEUTRAL HOMES WHY ALL 
THE FUSS WE WENT TO FIND OUT 
RUSH HOUR IN DUNSFOLD IS NOT QUITE 
LIKE CENTRAL LONDON THE 
INHABITANTS ARE USED TO SLOWER 
PACE OF LIFE PLANS TO TRANSFORM 
THE AERODROME HERE INTO NEW ECO 
TOWN HAVE CAUSED QUITE A STIR WE WE ARE DRIVING THROUGH NOW WHAT WOULD 
BE PART OF THE RESIDENTIAL 
DEVELOPMENT 
JIM MCALLISTER IS DEVELOPMENT PROUD OF HIS VISION IT IS NO 
ORDINARY ONE OVER TWO THOUSAND HOMES JOBS 
A SCHOOL EVEN A ROADS CHARGE TO 
GET PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS 
IT IS 
TAKING THE BEST FROM THE PAST 
BLENDING IT WITH THE BEST FROM THE 
PRESENT AND TRYING TO CREATE THE 
FUTURE AS TO HOW WE WILL LIVE IN 
THE FUTURE 
IT WOULD ALL BE BUILT 
HERE ON THIS AS STRIP CURRENTLY 
HOME TO ANY CAR LOVER'S DREAM SHOW 
THIS IS THE VERY CENTRE OF THE TOP 
GEAR TRACK WHERE THEY RACE CARS UP 
AND DOWN AS FAST AS THEY CAN IT 
WOULD ALSO BE THE VERY CENTRE OF 
THIS NEW ECO TOWN DESPITE PROMISES 
IT WOULD BE GREEN AND SUSTAINABLE 
IT HAS ALREADY SET PULSES RACING 
PETE IS ONE OF THE ENGINEERS OF 
OPPOSITION 
THIS WILL AFFECT SOME OPPOSITION SEVENTEEN THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS 
CLAIMING TO HAVE 
ONE THOUSAND BACKERS HE FEARS SUCH A LARGE 
DEVELOPMENT SIMPLY HAS TO IMPACT 
THE SURROUNDING AREA 
ROADS ARE 
ALREADY CONGESTED IN THE AREA AND 
ANOTHER THREE THOUSAND PLUS CARS WILL ADD A 
UNNECESSARY BURDEN LOCAL SERVICES 
HOSPITALS SCHOOLS RAILWAYS ETC 
WILL BE AFFECTED LET ALONE THE 
FACT THAT WE HAVE OUR BEAUTIFUL 
LOCAL COUNTRYSIDE WHICH WILL BE 
SCARRED BY THE INTRUSION OF THIS 
SIZE 
THE FINAL DECISION WILL REST SIZE WITH THE LOCAL COUNCIL OF COURSE 
IT IS VERY MUCH IN THE PUBLIC 
DOMAIN ANY RECOMMENDATION THAT THE 
PLANNING OFFICE HAS COME UP WITH 
WILL BE THOROUGHLY JUSTIFIED CAN 
CERTAINLY ASSURE YOU THAT THERE IS 
NO DONE DEAL 
BUT THERE IS ALREADY 
A HUGE AMOUNT OF PASSION OVER 
DUNSFOLD'S FUTURE ANYONE ELSE WITH 
AN OPINION WILL HAVE TO RACE 
CONSULTATION CLOSES AT THE END OF 
MAY MAY WITH A MASSIVE SHORTAGE OF SPACE IN 
OUR CEMETERIES PLANNING A FUNERAL 
HAS BECOME A HARSH REALITY OF 
LIVING IN LONDON TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE 
BURIED IN THE CAPITAL EVERY YEAR 
SO PERHAPS IT IS NOT SURPRISING 
THAT LONDONERS ARE LOOKING FOR NEW 
ALTERNATIVES TO A TRADITIONAL 
BURIAL GROUND KATHARINE CARPENTER 
EXPLAINS EXPLAINS IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE A MORE 
PEACEFUL SPOT EPPING FOREST IS NOW 
HOME TO THE LARGEST WOODLAND BURIAL 
PARTY IN THE U. K. ANYONE CAN BUY A 
SPACE HERE EACH OF THE PARTS IS 
MARKED WITH ONE OF THESE WOODEN 
STAKES THEY'RE OFTEN CLUSTERED 
AROUND ONE OF THE FOREST TREES 
BECAUSE THE WOODLAND IS CHANGING 
ALL THE TIME CAUGHT IN ITS ARE 
TAKEN AT THE HEAD AND FOOT OF EACH 
GRAVE SO YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU 
WILL FIND YOUR YOUR FINAL RESTING 
PLACE WILL BE 
PEOPLE FEEL 
COMFORTABLE IN THE WOODLAND 
ENVIRONMENT THEY LOVE TO COME AND 
VISIT AND WALK AROUND AND VISIT THE 
BLUEBELLS AND LISTEN TO THE 
BIRDSONG IT IS A LOVELY AND 
PEACEFUL ENVIRONMENT AND IT IS ALSO 
A LOVELY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH TO 
REMEMBER PEOPLE 
IT COULD BE A MORE 
PRACTICAL OPTION TOO LONDON'S 
COUNCIL CEMETERIES AND CHURCHYARDS 
ARE RAPIDLY RUNNING OUT OF SPACE 
AND SOME GRAVES ARE BEING RE USED 
THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY SAID GOODBYE 
TO LOVED ONES AT THE BURIAL GROUND 
SAY IT WAS A WELCOME ALTERNATIVE 
IT IS RELAXING IT IS PEACEFUL IT 
IS NOT UNIFORM EVERYTHING ABOUT IT 
IS WONDERFUL 
TODAY THE PARK WAS 
OFFICIALLY OPENED BY FORMER B. B. C. 
NEWS CORRESPONDENT KATE ADIE IF IF YOU ARE A REPORTER YOU GO TO A LOT 
OF FUNERALS YOU SEE A LOT OF HOW 
PEOPLE TREAT THE END OF LIFE FOR 
YEARS I HAVE BEEN CONVINCED THAT 
WHAT YOU NEED IS SOMETHING WHICH 
PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH 
BURIALS ARE BIG BUSINESS DOUBLE 
PLOT COST BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN ONE THOUSAND 
HEADSTONES ARE NOT ALLOWED AND 
MEMORIALS HAVE TO BE BIODEGRADABLE
