ABSOLUTELY I JUST GOT HOOKED I CAN QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT NOW YOU'RE A PHYSIOTHERAPIST I AM YES 
HOW DID YOU START AS A PHYSIOTHERAPIST I USED TO WORK IN A LOCAL FACTORY 
IT'S QUITE A BIG CHANGE IN CAREER THAT IT WAS A BIG CHANGE WORKING IN A FACTORY TO LOOK FOR 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND DECIDE WHAT IT IS I REALLY WANT TO DO 
I HAD TWO CHILDREN AT THE TIME AND HAD TO PUT EVERYTHING ON THE BACK BURNER GO BACK TO UNIVERSITY 
BUT THEY SUPPORTED YOU THROUGH IT ALL 
THE TWO CHILDREN AND MY WIFE DID TO GET ME THROUGH BRILLIANT EXCELLENT YEAH 
NOW THERE IS ONE EXPERT THAT STANDS HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE ALL THE REST IN YOUR OPINION RIGHT 
YES ABSOLUTELY AND WHO WOULD THAT BE THEN 
IT'S PAUL LAIDLAW HE'S OUR HERO THE REASON HE'S OUR HERO 
IS BECAUSE OF HIS CATCHPHRASE WHICH IS WHAT THINK YOU OF THIS 
SOMETIMES IF I'M COMING OUT OF A CUBICLE AFTER SEEING A PATIENT AND IT'S A PRETTY DIFFICULT PATIENT

SO PAUL YOU ARE A PHYSIOTHERAPIST LIKE DAVE HERE YEP 
WHAT GOT YOU INTO THE PROFESSION 
WELL MY WIFE'S A TEACHER AND SHE WAS AT UNIVERSITY 
DOING HER TEACHER TRAINING WHEN WE WERE STILL GOING OUT 
SHE SHARED A HOUSE WITH THREE PHYSIO STUDENTS AND AT THE TIME I WAS WORKING IN THE FACTORY AS WELL 
AND I USED TO GO ALONG AND TALK TO THEM REALLY YEAH RUBBISH YOU FANCIED THE PHYSIO STUDENTS

YES WE WANT TO BE THE FIRST TEAM TO MAKE A LIFE CHANGING SUM OF MONEY PAY THE MORTGAGE OFF MOVE ABROAD 
YOU'VE HAD TO WAIT FIVE HUNDRED PROGRAMMES TO FIND A TEAM TO MAKE A LIFE CHANGING SUM OF MONEY 
ANYWAY HERE WE GO THREE HUNDRED HERE'S YOUR THREE HUNDRED YOU KNOW THE RULES YOUR EXPERTS AWAIT AND SHOVE OFF 
WELL WHAT ABOUT THAT 
A PAIR OF DECORATORS VERSUS A PAIR OF PHYSIOTHERAPISTS 
WHATEVER'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT 
I'M PUTTING ON MY TOP HAT 
TYING UP MY WHITE TIE BRUSHING OFF MY TAILS 
PUTTING ON HIS TOP HAT FOR THE REDS IT'S CHARLES HANSON 
AND WHAT THINK YOU OF THIS 
IT'S PAUL LAIDLAW FOR THE BLUES 
CHARLES WHAT DO YOU RECKON TO THIS OIL PAINTING 
ARE YOU A SAILOR I'M NOT CHARLES 
I DO LIKE GALLEONS YES WHAT DO YOU RECKON IT'S NICE ISN'T IT 
WHAT CONCERNED ME FIRST OF ALL MICK IS ITS FRAME 
THIS FRAME IN ALL HONESTY IS NO MORE THAN TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS OLD 
WE CAN SEE VERY CLOSELY THAT IT IS OIL 
THIS IMPASTO TECHNIQUE IS RAISED OIL LAID ON CANVAS 
AND THEN ON TO BOARD AND WE CAN SEE THIS CLIPPER SHIP 
TYPICALLY LATE EIGHTEENTH EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY GALLEON 
IS PARTICULARLY WELL PAINTED WITH A FEW MASTS 
WHAT CONCERNS ME ALSO SLIGHTLY IS THIS OVERPAINTING 
YEAH DO YOU THINK SOMEBODY'S HAD A GO AT CLEANING IT AT ONE TIME NO 
I THINK IT'S BEEN OVERPAINTED OR IT'S VARNISH IT'S BEEN CLEANED OFF TO AN EXTENT 
BUT STILL IN THE LEFT CORNER IT'S THERE STILL IT'S SIGNED AS WELL IT IS 
IT'S E. K. REDMORE DO YOU KNOW THE ARTIST 
I DON'T KNOW THE ARTIST NO OBVIOUSLY HE'S VERY COMPETENT 
HE WASN'T AN AMATEUR ARTIST 
HOW OLD IS IT MICK THAT'S THE IMPORTANT QUESTION 
I HATE TO GUESS THAT WAS QUITE ORIGINAL IT'S BEEN REFRAMED 
YEAH YOU CAN SEE IT LOOKS LIKE SOME OLD POSTER OR SOMETHING ON THERE 
IT'S A FUNNY OLD THING THIS WE'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT AN OIL ON CANVAS WHICH IS I HOPE ONE HUNDRED TEN YEARS OLD 
IT COULD BE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY IT COULD BE ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO NINETEEN TEN AS A PERIOD 
BUT DON'T FORGET THE CHINESE WERE VERY GOOD AT AUTOREPRODUCING THIS 
WHICH ARE OUTRIGHT FAKES AND FORGERIES 
WHAT'S IT WORTH CAPTAIN HE'S ACTUALLY ASKING ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOR IT 
IS HE BUT I'VE HAD A WORD AND HE WILL COME DOWN TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
YES WILL IT SINK OR SWIM MICK THAT'S THE QUESTION ISN'T IT 
DECISION TIME DECISION TIME I LIKE IT 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON MICK YEAH YEAH WE'LL GO FOR IT 
WOW ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PAID BUT ARE THEY SAILING TOO CLOSE TO THE WIND 
THINGS TO DO 
IT'S JUST LIKE BEING AT HOME WITH YOU GUYS 
WHAT THINK YOU OF THIS 
STEADY 
WHAT THINK YOU OF THIS WE WERE BOTH WALKING PAST FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS 
AND SAW IT IN THE CABINET AND BOTH STOPPED AND LOOKED AT IT 
BUT APART FROM BEING A PAPERWEIGHT DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS WELL THAT'S THE EFFECT WE NEED ISN'T IT 
A PIECE THAT JUST GRABS YOU FROM AFAR 
EXCELLENT WELL LOOK THIS HAS ALL THE HALLMARKS OF DITCHFIELD GLASS 
DITCHFIELD'S THE GLASSMAKER 
NOT A PLACE A GLASS WORKER FATHER AND SON 
OUT OF OF ALL PLACES BLACKPOOL 
WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A LILY PAD PAPERWEIGHT 
PRETTY MUCH BREAD AND BUTTER FOR DITCHFIELD WITH THIS LITTLE SIGNATURE SILVER FROG HERE 
HOW OLD DO YOU THINK ANY IDEAS 
I DON'T THINK IT'S OLD I THINK IT'S QUITE CONTEMPORARY 
YEAH YOU'RE SPOT ON BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE TECHNIQUE AND EVEN THE AESTHETIC 
I THINK IT HARKS BACK TO THE LATE NINETEENTH EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY 
WE'RE THINKING OF CONTINENTAL MANUFACTURERS AND INDEED THERE IS A TOUCH OF THE ART NOUVEAU GOING ON 
NATURALISTIC BUT YOU'RE SPOT ON THIS IS MODERN GLASS 
SO DO YOU THINK WE'LL GET A PROFIT OUT OF THAT I'VE SOLD THEM UP TO EIGHTY 
LAST OUTING I'LL BE HONEST I THOUGHT THE MARKET HAD CALMED DOWN A LITTLE BUT WHERE ARE WE WITH THIS 
I THINK WE'VE TALKED THE BLOKE DOWN TO ABOUT FORTY 
DOWN TO FORTY YEAH 
I THINK YOU'RE ON THE MONEY AT THAT IN ALL HONESTY I THINK THAT'S A CAUTIOUS LOW ESTIMATE 
I'D TAKE A PUNT EXCELLENT UP FOR IT 
YEP GO ON LET'S GO FOR IT 
COME ON AND JUMP TO THE BEAT 
THE BLUES HAVE CERTAINLY JUMPED TO IT 
FORTY DISHED OUT FOR THE PAPERWEIGHT 
IS THAT NOT JUST THE MOST GORGEOUS OBJECT 
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S MARVELLOUS 
THIS KIND OF EPITOMISES THE LATE VICTORIAN PERIOD 
WHEN EXCITEMENT AND NOVELTY WERE ALL THE RAGE 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FOUR THE BLACKPOOL TOWER WAS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING COMPLETED 
FIVE YEARS EARLIER THE EIFFEL TOWER WAS FINISHED 
BLACKPOOL CORPORATION THOUGHT THEY'D LIKE ONE SO THEY COMMISSIONED ONE 
AND HAVING BEEN TO SEE THIS MARVELLOUS STRUCTURE YOU'D WANT TO TAKE HOME A LITTLE MEMENTO 
AND THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ULTIMATE INEXPENSIVE TAKE AWAY TOY TO COMMEMORATE YOUR VISIT 
IT'S MADE OF GLASS TRADITIONALLY THESE PIECES OF GLASS WERE MADE IN NAILSEA OUTSIDE BRISTOL 
WE START OFF WITH A NICE BLUE FLAG FLYING PROUDLY ON THE TOP 
AND THEN THERE'S THE KIND OF ONION DOME WHICH IS RETICULATED 
WHICH MEANS IT'S FULL OF LITTLE HOLES 
AND THEN YOU GO DOWN TO THESE STRAIGHT SECTIONS WHICH ARE INTERLACED AS IF WITH METAL 
BUT ACTUALLY IN TINY PIECES OF GLASS WITH OCCASIONAL BLOBS OF COLOUR WHICH IS RATHER FUN 
AND THEN AT THE BOTTOM THE BASE IS SIMPLY MADE OUT OF MORE LITTLE FILAMENTS OF GLASS 
WOUND AROUND AND ABOUT SO THAT THE THING WILL STAND SQUARE ON A TABLE 
AS A LOVELY REMINDER OF YOUR DAY OUT SO WHAT'S A THING LIKE THIS WORTH 
FRANKLY IF YOU COME FROM BLACKPOOL AND YOU'RE PROUD OF YOUR TOWN 
AND YOU LIKE THE HISTORY OF THE TOWER IT OUGHT TO BE WORTH BETWEEN SAY FIFTY AND ONE HUNDRED 
BUT ACTUALLY THE SPECIAL THING IS THAT HERE IN BARNARD CASTLE 
THIS CHAP IS AVAILABLE FOR A FIVE NOTE 
PATHETIC ISN'T IT FIVE 
WOULDN'T EVEN BUY YOU A PLATE OF FAGGOTS AND PEAS IN BLACKPOOL TODAY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT IT'S NICE ISN'T IT VERY COLOURFUL 
YEAH IT MAKES A NICE OBJECT ACTUALLY IT'S VERY DECORATIVE PRETTY IF WE TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN 
WE WANT TO KNOW WHO'S MADE IT WHERE WAS IT MADE AND WHAT YEAR AND ON THE BASE HERE 
WE'VE GOT THIS VERY VERY TYPICAL PSUEDO CHINESE MARK AND IN FACT IT'S FRENCH 
IT'S A FRENCH HARD PASTE BODY OF PORCELAIN WHICH IN STYLE IS PURPORTED TO BE 
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IN WORCESTER BUT IN FACT A GREAT FORGER 
WHO WAS FRENCH IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY EMILE SAMPSON HE MADE THIS IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETIES 
ALMOST TO DECEIVE A BUYING PUBLIC THAT WHAT THEY WERE BUYING WAS IN FACT WORCESTER 
IT'S A NICE OBJECT THE COLOURING'S GOOD 
IT'S WHAT WE CALL THE KAKIEMON CHRYSANTHEMUM PALLET AND I LIKE IT WHO'S IT GOING TO APPEAL TO JEFF 
I THINK IT COULD APPEAL TO QUITE A FEW COLLECTORS YEAH WOULD YOU BUY IT FOR YOUR WIFE 
NO 
IT WOULDN'T BE HER TASTE WHAT'S THE CONDITION LIKE JEFF IS IT FAIRLY GOOD IT LOOKS VERY GOOD 
BUT I'VE JUST SPOTTED A HAIRLINE CRACK A DISCERNING EYE HERE YEAH 
NOTHING WILL GET PAST YOU WILL IT WELL HOPEFULLY NOT 
O. K. WHAT'S IT WORTH 
WELL HE'S ASKING EIGHTY FIVE 
IS THAT WHAT'S ON IT O. K. YEAH 
EMILE SAMPSON FRENCH PORCELAIN JUG OF THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETIES 
IT OUGHT TO FETCH SOMETHING CERTAINLY EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED A NICE POT JEFF ARE YOU IN WITH THAT 
I THINK WE'LL GO FOR IT YEP 
THE REDS MANAGED TO GET TWENTY OFF THE JUG GOOD WORK BOYS SIXTY FIVE PAID 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS PAUL THAT LOOKS QUITE NICE DOESN'T IT A LITTLE SILVER SET 
WHAT'S THIS FOR PAUL FOR A START THAT LITTLE SPOON THERE WHO'S USING THAT BABY SPOON 
ABSOLUTELY WE THINK THIS IS A NURSERY PIECE AS WELL 
O. K. NOT TO BE TRUSTED WITH FORKS THESE LITTLE BLIGHTERS 
PUSHER PUSHING IT ON 
YEAH MASHED TO AN EXTENT AS WELL SWEET LITTLE INFANTS' FEEDING SET ARE THEY SILVER 
LET'S HAVE A LITTLE LOOK HAVE WE GOT MARKS WE HAVE 
AND THOSE ARE ENGLISH HALLMARKS 
INTER WAR TWENTIES THIRTIES 
AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT DECORATION ON THE TERMINALS THERE ISN'T THAT SWEET 
IN RELIEF A LITTLE BABY IN ITS CRADLE AND THE LITTLE LEGEND HUSH A BYE BABY 
ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL WHAT MADE YOU PICK THAT UP 
WELL AS I WAS JUST GOING PAST I JUST SAW IT IN THE CASE THERE 
AND IT LOOKED A NICE SET AND I JUST WONDERED IF IT WAS SILVER 
I'VE BEEN ALONG TO THE SHOP OWNER AND GOT HIM DOWN TO THIRTY FIVE 
YOU'RE THERE ALREADY AT THIRTY FIVE 
WELL WOULD YOU BUY THEM AT THAT PERSONALLY I WOULD CHRISTENING PRESENT SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THAT'S THE MARKET SMALL SILVER COLLECTORS YES COLLECTORS OF NURSERY RELATED MATERIAL 
BUT EVERY DAY THERE'S A MARKET FOR THIS CHRISTENING PRESENT 
AND WHAT A SWEET ONE IT WOULD MAKE AT THAT 
I THINK YOU'VE DONE ALL RIGHT AT THAT 
SURELY ANY AUCTIONEER'S GOING TO ESTIMATE THIRTY TO FORTY ON THOSE AND BE CAUTIOUS IN SO DOING 
THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT OVER EGGING THE CAKE AT THIRTY TO FORTY 
I THINK THAT'S A WINNER GAME ON 
THE BLUES FORKED OUT THIRTY FIVE FOR THE LITTLE TOAD'S FEEDING SET 
I WONDER HOW THE REDS ARE GETTING ON 
O. K. CHAPS LIFE'S TOO SHORT IT REALLY IS 
AND IT'S NOT OFTEN YOU COME INTO AN ANTIQUES SHOP 
AND YOU SEE SOMETHING REALLY QUITE RARE AND QUITE EXCITING BECAUSE HERE THEY ARE 
FIRST OF ALL COUNTRY OF ORIGIN 
CHINESE THEY'RE THESE VERY EXCITING DOGS OF FOE OR INCENSE STANDS 
THEY'RE VERY CRUDE THEY'RE VERY COARSE 
AN EARTHENWARE BODY BUT JUST POSSIBLY JUST POSSIBLY 
THEY COULD BE MING IN PERIOD 
AND BY MING I MEAN PRE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FORTY FOUR OR PRE THE MID SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
GOING BACK TO ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT 
AS OLD AS THAT ABSOLUTELY 
THEY COULD BE IN OUR ENGLISH HISTORICAL TERMS ELIZABETHAN 
WE'RE TALKING FOUR HUNDRED OR FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
HOW CAN YOU DATE SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT JEFF AND YOU GET A FEEL FOR AN OBJECT 
JUST THROUGH HANDLING OVER TIME POTTERY 
AND JUST HOW THE WEAR AND TEAR THE CHIPS THE FRAGILE NATURE OF THEM 
AND HOW THE GLAZE HAS PITTED THAT GIVES US A CERTAIN ANGLING THAT THEY COULD BE THAT FAR BACK 
I SPOKE TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO OWNS THEM IN THE SHOP 
AND THEY WERE OWNED BY THE LATE TED SEATON 
WHO WAS A VERY IMPORTANT COLLECTOR OF CHINESE WORKS OF ARTS 
SO THEY'VE GOT GOOD PROVENANCE BUT THEY'RE HIGHLY SPECULATIVE 
WHO WOULD THESE APPEAL TO CHARLES THEY APPEAL TO ME 
BECAUSE I LOVE HISTORY AND WE THINK WE'RE HANDLING SOMETHING HERE 
WHICH COULD BE FOUR HUNDRED OR FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD DOESN'T THAT GIVE YOU THE WOW FACTOR 
IT DOES IT DOES THEY'VE GOT TO BE VERY RARE 
YEAH THEY WEREN'T MADE FOR THE FINE EXPORT CHINESE PORCELAIN MARKET 
THEY WERE MADE FOR THE FOR THE LOWER CLASS FOR THE LOWER MARKET FOR THE PEASANTS 
WHAT ARE THEY WORTH 
THEY COULD ONLY FETCH FIFTY BUT TO ME THEY'RE ON OFFER FOR NINETY 
AND WHAT CAN YOU BUY FOR NINETY TODAY WHICH JUST MAY BE JUST MAY BE MING 
THAT WONDERFUL WORD MING IF THEY WERE MING PLATES IN BLUE AND WHITE 
AND MADE FOR THE IMPERIAL MARKET THEY'D BE WORTH MILLIONS 
BUT THESE ARE FROM A LOWER LEAGUE YEAH 
BUT THEY'RE STILL DELIGHTFUL ARE YOU WITH ME YEAH WE'RE WITH YOU 
I CAN'T GUARANTEE BIG MONEY 
I CAN'T GUARANTEE PROFIT BUT I THINK FOR WHAT THEY ARE IT'S A GAMBLE WORTH TAKING 
THE REDS ARE BETTING BOYS THEY PURCHASED THE CHINESE DOGS FOR NINETY AH SO 
WHAT WOULD SHE BE CALLED YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER BROGAN 
BROGAN AT THE AGE WHEN SHE GETS VERY EMBARRASSED 
WELL DONE BROGAN 
YOU BE A GOOD GIRL NOW 
THE CHEEK OF IT 
NO SITTING DOWN ON THE JOB 
RIGHT LOOK 
MIGHT JUST HAVE YOUR LAST LOT WHAT DOES THAT DO FOR YOU GUYS 
THAT'S LOVELY IT REMINDS ME OF A PIECE I MADE AT SCHOOL IN METALWORK 
PLANISHED OUT LIKE THAT 
MINE WASN'T SILVER YEAH YOU DID SILVERSMITHING IN 
HOW DOES ONE MAKE A BOWL LIKE THAT THEN 
WELL WE HAD LIKE A LEATHER CUSHION FORMER 
AND WE GOT A FLAT PIECE OF COPPER ON THE FORMER AND THEN HAMMERED IT 
PLANISHED AROUND TILL IT CURVED UP 
YEP GOT ALL THOSE LITTLE MARKS IN 
SPREAD IT ROUND TILL IT CURVED ANY IDEA WHY YOU WOULD DO THAT 
WELL WE JUST DID IT FOR DECORATIVE EFFECT 
IT DOES GIVE A LOVELY DECORATIVE EFFECT AND IMPORTANTLY IT HARDENS THE METAL 
SO IT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO PRODUCING A STRONG BODY 
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THESE CAST FEET HERE SUGGESTIVE OF ART NOUVEAU 
ABSOLUTELY AND THAT GIVES US AN INCLINATION OF THE PERIOD 
SO YOU'VE GOT THE STYLISED IVY LEAVES HERE TYPICAL A NATURALISTIC FORM 
AND THAT IS REPEATED IN THAT FOOT 
SO ACTUALLY YOU'VE GOT A MARRIAGE OF ARTS AND CRAFTS INFLUENCE IN THAT HAND FINISH 
BUT IN THESE CAST FEET HERE YOU'VE GOT THE ART NOUVEAU 
AND THAT'S SUGGESTING TO US THAT IT'S LATE NINETEENTH EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY 
AND WE'LL LOOK AT THE HALLMARKS NINETEEN OH SEVEN SHEFFIELD EDWARDIAN SILVER 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE WEIGHT IN THAT 
IT'S PRETTY IT'S GOOD ISN'T IT 
SO MUCH SMALL SILVER THAT WE PICK UP IT'S WAFER THIN 
BUT MY WORD THAT'S CONSIDERABLE IS IT NOT 
YEAH IT IS YEAH 
SO HOW MUCH WOULD YOU SAY FOR THIS THEN 
WELL IT WAS QUITE EXPENSIVE 
I'VE GOT IT DOWN TO SEVENTY 
NOW I'M NOT GUARANTEEING YOU A PROFIT ON THAT 
I'M GUARANTEEING YOU INTEREST 
ON A GOOD DAY THAT'S ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED TWENTY WORTH OF SILVER 
BUT THAT'S A GOOD DAY ON A BAD DAY IT'S WORTH SIXTY TO EIGHTY SO 
IT'S A GAMBLER'S PIECE BUT I'M THINKING OF THE CLOCK 
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING WITH STYLE QUALITY CONDITION 
WE'RE THERE OR THEREABOUTS BUT IT'S OVER TO YOU GUYS

AND IT'S BEAMISH MUSEUM NEAR NEWCASTLE 
IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO GET A TASTE OF THE PAST IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE 
FANCY SOME HUMBUG WELL THERE'S CERTAINLY PLENTY OF THAT ON BRITISH T. V. TODAY 
THE HUMBLE HUMBUG WAS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SWEETS OF THE VICTORIAN ERA 
AND THE SWEETIE SHOP HERE AT BEAMISH TODAY 
IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR SHOPS IN THE HIGH STREET 
BEHIND THE SCENES HERE IS A FASCINATING STORY OF VICTORIAN SWEET SUCCESS 
GOSH THAT LOOKS DANGEROUS DOESN'T IT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE THEN 
WE'RE MAKING BARLEY SUGAR TODAY FLAVOURING IN 
SO THIS IS JUST MOLTEN SUGAR IS IT 
YEAH RIGHT IT'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX DEGREES CELSIUS 
IT'S A GREAT COLOUR 
THIS IS A COOLING TABLE IT'S GOT COLD WATER FLUSHING THROUGH IT ALL THE TIME 
SO WHEN I MOVE THESE RETAINING BARS AWAY 
IT SHOULD BE IN ONE PLACE 
ISN'T THAT EXTRAORDINARY 
MOVING IT INTO THE MIDDLE IT LOOKS LOVELY AND MESSY DOESN'T IT 
ARE ANY OF THESE SWEETS MEDICINAL 
A LOT OF THEM ARE SARSAPARILLA WAS FOR RHEUMATICS 
BLACK BULLETS THAT THE PITMEN TOOK DOWN THE PIT TO CLEAR THE THROAT 
CINDER TOFFEE WAS FOR A HANGOVER OH WAS IT YEAH HOW BRILLIANT 
THE BARLEY SUGAR THAT WE'RE MAKING TODAY WAS FOR TRAVEL SICKNESS 
IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE YOUR MOUTH WATER ISN'T IT 
IT'S LIKE AN ORGANIC LIVING THING 
SOMETHING OUT OF E. T. 
YEAH 
DOES IT FEEL HOT OH YES LOOK YOU COULD WARM YOUR HANDS OFF IT

WHEN THE SUGAR HAS COOLED AND SOLIDIFIED JUST ENOUGH 
CHUNKS ARE CUT OFF AND PRESSED THROUGH A SPECIAL MANGLE

WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HOPE FOR SWEET PROFITS TODAY AT THE AUCTION AREN'T WE YEAH 
WELL IT'S GRAND TO BE IN YORKSHIRE 
IN LEYBURN WITH RODNEY TENNANT IN HIS VERY OWN SALE ROOM RODNEY 
YOU'RE ALWAYS VERY WELCOME 
NOW MICK AND JEFF THEY WENT WITH THIS SO CALLED SAMPSON POT 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT 
WELL I'VE HAD A CLOSE LOOK AT IT AND I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY LATER THAN SAMPSON 
SAMPSON A FRENCH MANUFACTURER IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY COPIED WORCESTER 
THIS IS BASICALLY AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WORCESTER SHAPE 
THEY WOULD USUALLY PUT A WORCESTER MARK ON IT WHICH WOULD BE A CRESCENT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
COS THEY'RE COPYING WORCESTER YEAH 
THIS HAS GOT A RIBBON EMBLEM WHICH IS REALLY COPYING THIS ORIENTAL PATTERN RIGHT 
SO I THINK IT'S A COPY OF A COPY A COPY OF A COPY 
IT'S VERY GOOD QUALITY PORCELAIN AND VERY GOOD QUALITY DECORATION BUT IT JUST AIN'T SAMPSON 
NO I WOULDN'T CATALOGUE IT AS SAMPSON WHAT WOULD YOUR ESTIMATE BE 
FORTY TO SIXTY O. K. SIXTY FIVE PAID THEY MIGHT JUST STRUGGLE TO IT MIGHTN'T THEY 
OH THEY SHOULD WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE MARIE CELESTE HERE 
WELL I THINK THIS IS JUST BRAND NEW YOU DON'T THINK IT'S GOT ANY AGE AT ALL I DON'T 
NOW WE DO GET THESE IN AND THE MARKET'S FLOODED WITH THEM 
WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS A BRAND NEW FRAME 
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY OBVIOUS ISN'T IT YES YES 
WE'VE GOT WHAT LOOKS TO BE AN OLD BACK BUT THE OLD BACK 
IS JUST A COBBLED TOGETHER BIT OF NONSENSE IS IT YES 
THAT OLD CARDBOARDY THING IS TO FOOL YOUR EYE YES 
THEN YOU SHOVE A NAME ON IT YES 
OF A REASONABLE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY ARTIST WHO DID MARINE VIEWS 
EXACTLY O. K. WE'RE GETTING THE MESSAGE HERE RODNEY 
BECAUSE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY WAS PAID FOR THIS MASTERPIECE KNOCK ONE HUNDRED OFF 
KNOCK ONE HUNDRED OFF PROBABLY 
WELL THERE WE GO WE'D BETTER STAND BY 
WHAT ABOUT THESE OLD DOGS THEN 
WELL THEY'RE TRYING TO BE TANG AREN'T THEY 
WELL THEY'RE TRYING TO BE TANG BUT THEY'RE NOT TENTH CENTURY OR NINTH CENTURY 
THEY ARE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
TYPICAL TURQUOISE GLAZE I THINK THIS IS GENUINE WEAR AND TEAR 
SOMETIMES YOU GET THINGS THAT ARE FAKE THAT ARE KNOCKED ABOUT TO MAKE THEM LOOK OLD 
I THINK THESE HAVE AGED BUT I THINK THEY'RE JUST TOO FAR GONE 
RIGHT THEY'RE INTERESTING THINGS TO HAVE 
THEY'RE THINGS TO TALK ABOUT BUT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO ADD THEM TO AN ORIENTAL COLLECTION 
O. K. USE THEM AS JOSS STICK HOLDERS THIRTY OR FORTY FOR THAT PURPOSE 
RIGHT NINETY PAID 
DO YOU KNOW I'M FEELING SO MUCH TENSION ABOUT THESE ITEMS 
THAT I'M ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED THEIR BONUS BUY 
SO LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
NOW CARLOS WE GAVE YOU TWENTY FIVE LEFTOVER LOLLY 
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN THE WAY OF AN INVESTMENT I ONLY SPENT FIFTEEN 
A NICE LITTLE BOX WHAT WE'VE GOT TIM 
IS A NICE LATE VICTORIAN PASTRY CUTTER 
TREEN IT'S A REQUISITE LOTS OF COLLECTORS FOR SUCH AN ITEM 
AND LIKEWISE ALL TOGETHER WITH A VERY NICE EDWARDIAN PENCIL 
AND AGAIN MOUNTED IN IVORY AND ALSO STAMPED SO IT HAS A NICE CONTEXT 
AND THERE ARE LOTS OF COLLECTORS OF THESE ITEMS WHAT DO YOU THINK 
IT'S NOT WHAT I WERE EXPECTING 
THAT'S GOOD THEN ISN'T IT 
THAT'S TRUE WE LIKE TO KEEP YOU ON YOUR TOES YOU KNOW YEAH 
THAT OLD EMULSION BRUSH OF YOURS WHO WOULD USE THIS NOWADAYS THOUGH 
THERE'S LOTS OF COLLECTORS OF QUIRKY PARAPHERNALIA 
AND THESE SORTS OF DECORATIVE ACCOMPANIMENTS TO A DESK OR TO A KITCHEN 
ARE WHAT THE MARKET LIKES AND REQUIRES 
YEAH BUT WOULD THEY BRING ANYTHING IN AUCTION 
I THINK SO IT'S AMAZING THE MARKET TODAY FOR 
PARTICULARLY BUYERS WHO ARE ONLINE THEY LIKE THESE QUIRKY OBJECTS 
AND TO ME I SPENT FIFTEEN ON THESE 
MY AUCTION GUIDE PRICE WOULD BE CERTAINLY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAH 
IT'S NOT A HUGE AMOUNT IS IT FIFTEEN AND THEY'RE IN GOOD NICK I THINK THE BOY'S DONE WELL DON'T YOU 
YEAH YEAH FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME 
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT IT 
PASTRY CUTTER ANY GOOD WELL IT IS 
HOPEFULLY WITH THIS ADVENT OF ALL THESE TELEVISION PROGRAMMES 
ON COOKERY THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING BACK INTO IT THAT NIGELLA LAWSON 
AND MAKING THINGS YES AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT 
THEN HAVE A FEW OLD PASTRY MAKING THINGS WITH YOU 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE WORTH 
WELL I THINK THEY'RE BOTH LITTLE TREEN CURIOSITIES 
AND THEY MUST BE WORTH THE BACK END OF TEN EACH 
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WELL HE PAID FIFTEEN THAT'S FINE 
A TYPICAL EXAMPLE IF YOU CAN BUY INTERESTING THINGS ON A BUDGET 
THAT SEEMS TO BE IT FOR THE REDS 
NOW FOR THE BLUES DAVE AND PAUL 
THEY WENT WITH THIS FEEDING SET 
LOVELY IF YOU'VE GOT A CHRISTENING IN MIND I SUPPOSE 
YES YOU GET A LOT OF THESE IN 
AND YOU HARDLY EVER FIND THEY'VE BEEN USED SADLY 
I THINK THIS HAS THIS HAS GOT WEAR TO IT GOT TEETH MARKS ON IT ABSOLUTELY 
HOW MUCH THEN WELL THEY'LL PROBABLY MAKE TWENTY THIRTY 
THEY'RE WORTH MORE THAN THAT BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT IT'S WORTH AND WHAT IT MAKES 
THIRTY FIVE PAID FINE 
THEY MIGHT BE LUCKY TO MAKE A PROFIT ON THAT YEAH HOPE THEY WILL 
NOW MR. DITCHFIELD I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT THIS STUFF 
BUT IT'S GOOD ISN'T IT YOU CAN SEE WHY 
IT'S A VERY DECORATIVE LITTLE PAPERWEIGHT WITH THE FROG ON IT IT SHOULD BE FORTY TO SIXTY 
THAT'S GREAT THEY PAID FORTY YEAH 
SO THAT SHOULD BE A PROFIT WHICH WOULD BE MARVELLOUS 
AND THE LITTLE BONBON DISH I MEAN IT'S QUITE SOLID IT'S SILVER SOLID SILVER AGAIN 
YES IT'S QUITE A HEAVY GAUGE USEFUL LITTLE BOWL 
SHOULD BE FORTY TO SIXTY FORTY TO SIXTY 
I THINK SO OH LORD SEVENTY PAID 
THEY MAY STRUGGLE TO GET IT BUT LET'S HOPE THEY GET THAT AND MORE LET'S HOPE 
WE LIVE IN HOPE BUT REALISTICALLY FOR ME ANYWAY FORTY TO SIXTY IS PLENTY 
ANYWAY OVERALL I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO NEED THEIR BONUS BUY 
SO LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
SO YOU SPENT ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE WENT TO PAUL WHAT DID YOU SPEND IT ON PAUL 
I SPENT IT ON 
THAT BIZARRE OBJECT 
WHAT MAKE YOU OF THAT CHAPS 
ANY IDEAS WE CAN PLAY THE GUESSING GAME FIRST 
I'LL GIVE YOU THE CHANGE IF YOU GUESS WHAT IT IS OVER TO YOU 
COULDN'T BE A WASP TRAP COULD IT WHAT 
THIS HAS JUST COST YOU THE CHANGE THAT WAS A VERBAL CONTRACT ONLY 
RIGHT THEN 
I'LL GET MY JACKET 
WELL IF THAT'S WHAT IT IS 
PERIOD NINETEENTH CENTURY 
THEY'RE GENERALLY SOLD AS GEORGIAN 
I LOVE THESE I LIKE GEORGIAN GLASS 
I LIKE DOMESTIC COLLECTABLES YOU KNOW THE PRINCIPLE OF COURSE 
WE'VE SKIPPED OVER THAT YOU PUT A SWEET FLUID IN HERE 
COULD BE WATER WITH SOME BITS OF FOOD OR WHATEVER 
YOUR FLY CRAWLS IN UNDER 
IN HE GOES GLUG GLUG GLUG EX FLY 
I KNOW THE CORK WENT IN THERE SO HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR THAT 
I PAID ALL OF TWENTY 
NOW THEY'RE NOT EVERYONE'S CUP OF TEA BUT WHEN I'VE SEEN THEM SOLD GENERALLY THERE'S THIRTY IN THEM 
AND FORTY ON A GOOD DAY OR BAD DAY DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU WANT IT OR YOU'RE SELLING IT 
SO PAUL IT SEEMS TO ME HE'S PREDICTING MAYBE TEN OR TWENTY PROFIT ON THAT YEAH 
THINK ABOUT DEAD FLIES WASPS 
THINK ABOUT ALL THE CASH YOU'RE GOING TO PICK UP FROM HIM FROM THAT INITIAL OFFER 
AND WE'LL SHOVE OFF AND SEE WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT IT 
RIGHT IS THIS GOING TO CATCH A FLY OR NOT 
WELL I'M SURE IT WOULD CATCH A FLY IT WOULD PROBABLY DIE BEFORE IT GOT IN THERE 
IT WOULD CUT ITSELF ON THE TOP 
COS IT'S GOT SO BADLY CHIPPED IT'S GOT BADLY BROKEN YES 
IT'S A HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUE FOR THE FLY GETTING OVER THAT EDGE 
YES THAT'S RIGHT YES WHAT WOULD YOUR ESTIMATE BE 
WELL IN OUR AUCTION SALE TODAY WE HAVE CLEARED THE HOUSE AND ON A TRAY LOT 
AND THERE ARE THREE PERFECT ONES OF THESE 
WE'RE EXPECTING SORT OF FORTY FIFTY FOR THE TRAY FULL OF OBJECTS INCLUDING THREE OF THESE RIGHT 
SO THAT SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE IN THE REGION OF FIVE TO TEN AT THE MOST 
TWENTY PAID AS THE BONUS BUY I THINK I'LL TAKE THAT BACK FROM YOU NOW RODNEY YES 
AND I THINK I'LL CROSS EVERYTHING 
NOT LEAST FOR YOU OLD FRUIT RIGHT 
ANYWAY VERY GOOD LUCK ON THE ROSTRUM WE'RE IN SAFE HANDS 
WELL HERE WE ARE IN NORTH YORKSHIRE YET I HAVE BEEN TRANSPORTED TO THE MOTHER COUNTRY 
TO DEVON HOW'S THAT COME ABOUT 
WELL IT'S HAPPENED FOR ME THROUGH THESE THREE POTS 
IF I TURN THIS ONE UPSIDE DOWN IT SAYS C. H. BRANNAM BARUM ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT 
WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH DEVON 
WELL BARUM BARUM IS THE OLD ROMAN WORD FOR BARNSTAPLE 
AND THAT OF COURSE IS IN DEVON 
AND THAT OF COURSE IS WHERE I WAS BORN 
AND THAT'S WHY I'M SO ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT MY LOCAL POTTERY BARUM WARE 
WHEN CHARLES BRANNAM STARTED HIS POTTERY IN BARNSTAPLE 
INSTEAD OF CALLING IT BARNSTAPLE POTTERY HE REVERTED BACK TO THE OLD ROMAN NAME 
AND IT'S BEEN KNOWN AS BARUM WARE EVER SINCE 
THIS IS A PARTICULARLY NICE POT 
IT'S AN OVOID JARDINIERE BUT OLD MR. BRANNAM TOOK THE TROUBLE 
OF GLAZING IT INSIDE SO YOU GET THAT NICE BLUE FINISH INSIDE 
AND THE DECORATION IS STYLISED FOLIAGE AND THESE ROUNDELS 
ALL PICKED OUT IN COLOURED SLIP 
IT'S A TYPE OF SCRAFFITO WHERE HE'S SCRATCHED THROUGH THE DESIGN 
INTO THE WET CLAY BEFORE IT'S GONE OFF TO BE FIRED 
THIS THING IS A PRETTY STANDARD FLOWERPOT SHAPE 
EXCEPT HE'S DECORATED IT WITH A CONTINUOUS BAND 
A RATHER DOPEY LOOKING FISH 
THEY'RE FISH THAT HAVE BEEN ON TABLETS I THINK 
WITH ODD BITS OF WEED DRIFTING AROUND 
THE LAST ITEM IS THIS OVAL JARDINIERE WHICH I THINK IS MAGNIFICENT 
LOOK AT ALL THIS SWIRLING MOVEMENT THAT HE'S ACHIEVED IN THE CLAY 
WITH THESE GREEN AND BROWN GLAZES 
AND THIS ONE IS DATED NINETEEN OH SEVEN 
MAGNIFICENT ANYWAY WE'RE A LONG WAY AWAY FROM DEVON 
THE ESTIMATE IS TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED FOR THE THREE PIECES SO WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WON'T WE MY DEAR
