TONIGHT THE STIG TESTS A TUBE TRAIN 
RICHARD TESTS A PAIR OF SHORTS 
AND I TRY MY HAND AT RUNNING 
THANK YOU THANK YOU 
HELLO HELLO AND WELCOME 
WELCOME WELCOME TO AN AWARD WINNING TOP GEAR YEAH 
WE'VE GOT A GONG FOR BEST FACTUAL PROGRAMME 
WHICH IS ASTONISHING WHEN YOU THINK WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY PUT A FACT IN THE SHOW FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS 
NO MATTER WE'RE KICKING OFF TONIGHT WITH RICHARD NOT IN SHORTS 
HE IS IN FACT IN AN ASTON MARTIN 
THIS IS IT THE NEW V. EIGHT VANTAGE ROADSTER 
AND IT'S PIG UGLY 
ACTUALLY THOUGH IT'S NOT IT'S UNBELIEVABLY GORGEOUS 
NOT ONLY IS IT A LOOKER 
IT'S ALSO GOT THE SAME FORTY THREE LITRE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY HORSEPOWER V. EIGHT 
AS YOU GET IN THE VANTAGE COUPE 
WHICH MEANS IT MAKES THE SAME NOISE 
OH 
THAT ALONE IS WORTH NINETY THOUSAND OF THE NINETY ONE GRAND ASKING PRICE 
BUT LET'S NOT GET CARRIED AWAY 
BECAUSE WHEN ASTON HACK THE TOP OFF A CAR 
THEY'RE PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF TURNING A GOOD SPORTS CAR 
INTO A SOGGY BLANCMANGE 
THE D. B. NINE FOR INSTANCE IS FABULOUS TO DRIVE AS A HARD TOP 
BUT MUCH LESS THAN FABULOUS AS A ROADSTER 
THE QUESTION IS HAVE THEY MADE THE SAME MISTAKE HERE 
NOT EXACTLY 
USUALLY WHEN THEY MAKE A CABRIO VERSION 
THEY HAVE TO SOFTEN IT UP BECAUSE IT CAN'T HANDLE THE SPORTY TREATMENT 
THE CHASSIS ON THIS ROADSTER IS SO STIFF 
THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY GIVE IT FURTHER SUSPENSION 
RESULT IT ACTUALLY LIKES GOING ROUND CORNERS 
YES 
SO A ROADSTER THAT DRIVES LIKE A HARD TOP 
AND THOUGH IT PAINS ME TO SAY IT 
THIS THING MAKES A NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN LOOK LIKE A BIT OF A MINGER 
THERE ARE HOWEVER A FEW REMINDERS 
THAT ALTHOUGH ASTON IS NOW PRIVATELY OWNED 
THIS CAR CAME FROM THE FORD ERA 
AND THAT IT WAS INDEED CONCEIVED BY FORD'S CRACK TEAM 
OF ACCOUNTANTS 
THE KEY FOB MIGHT HAVE A NICE CLASSY LEATHER BACK 
BUT ACTUALLY IT'S TAKEN STRAIGHT FROM A TWENTY GRAND VOLVO 
AND THIS SCREEN HERE FOR ALL THE COMPUTER FUNCTIONS 
LOOKS LIKE IT CAME OFF AN AMSTRAD IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE 
AND WHY WHEN THEY GOT SOMEONE TO RECORD THE VOICE COMMANDS 
DID THEY CHOOSE THE WARDER FROM A WOMEN'S PRISON 
ONE HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD TURN RIGHT 
TURN RIGHT 
BUT I'M NIT PICKING BECAUSE REALLY THIS IS A GREAT CAR 
TOP SPEED IS ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR 
ZERO SIXTY TAKES FORTY NINE SECONDS 
OFTEN AT THIS POINT WE LIKE TO DEMONSTRATE A CAR'S STRAIGHT LINE PERFORMANCE 
BY HAVING A DRAG RACE 
TODAY IS NO EXCEPTION 
WE THOUGHT WE'RE NOT GONNA DRAG RACE AGAINST ANOTHER CAR 
WE THEREFORE RACE AGAINST A MAN 
HE'S CALLED DIRK 
AND HE'S FROM GERMANY 
NOW IF HE'S GOING TO RACE ME 
I'D BE STUPID TO LET HIM HANG ON TO MY COAT TAILS 
AND DIRK AGREES' 
WHICH IS WHY HE'S GOT THREE JET ENGINES 
TOGETHER MAKING THREE HUNDRED HORSEPOWER 
THAT HE'S GOING TO STRAP TO HIS BACK 
KITTED OUT WITH AN AERODYNAMIC HELMET AND SPECIAL INLINE SKATES 
THIS HUMAN CRUISE MISSILE CLAIMS HE CAN HIT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MILES AN HOUR 
TIME TO FIND OUT IF THAT'S JUST HOT AIR 
ASTON MARTIN SO THIS CAR WILL DO QUARTER OF A MILE IN JUST OVER THIRTEEN SECONDS 
HE DIDN'T EVEN FLINCH WHEN I TOLD HIM THAT SO 
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN BRITAIN AND GERMANY IN QUITE AN ODD WAY 
I MUST ADMIT GO TO BATTLE ONCE AGAIN 
IF YOU'D TOLD ME YOU'D HAD A DREAM IN WHICH YOU'D DRAG RACED AN ASTON MARTIN 
AGAINST A MAN ON JET POWERED ROLLER SKATES 
PEOPLE WOULD TELL YOU TO LAY OFF THE STRONG CHEESE AT NIGHT 
WE'RE AWAY 
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW QUICKLY THAT THING GETS OFF THE LINE 
EIGHTY 
NINETY 
ONE HUNDRED 
WE'RE LEVEL PEGGING HE'S ON ROLLER SKATES 
COME ON 
YEAH 
I WON 
I BEAT A MAN ON ROLLER SKATES 
IN AN ASTON MARTIN 
YES 
WELL DONE 
WELL DONE 
SO ER 
SO A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO YOU LOST AGAINST THE EUROFIGHTER 
BUT NOW YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO BEAT A GERMAN WITH BUNSEN BURNERS ON HIS BACK YES I HAVE 
BUT ONLY JUST AND THAT'S THE THING ABOUT THIS CAR 
IT'S JUST NOT QUITE AS FAST AS IT LOOKS AND SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GONNA BE 
IT'S THE SAME STORY WITH THE HARD TOP 
YOU THINK I'M GOING A MILLION AND THE SPEEDO SAYS YOU'RE DOING FORTY THREE 
BUT ULTIMATELY BE HONEST DO YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT THE SPEED 
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN A CONVERTIBLE ASTON MARTIN AND THERE'S NO BETTER PLACE TO BE 
YOU'RE THINKING AM I IN THE POST OFFICE QUEUEING 
NO I'M IN A CONVERTIBLE ASTON AND IT'S BRILLIANT 
I WOULD RATHER BE IN THIS THAN IN KEIRA KNIGHTLEY 
I WOULDN'T 
AND NOW THE NEWS THIS JUST IN FROM KEIRA KNIGHTLEY 
SHE SAYS SHE'S DISAPPOINTED BUT SHE UNDERSTANDS 
ANYWAY ON WITH ROAD SAFETY NEWS 
SWISS RESEARCHERS AT A UNIVERSITY HAVE FOUND THAT YOUNG MEN 
DRIVE FASTER WHEN THEY HEAR MASCULINE WORDS 
SOME PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS WORDS THEY'VE IDENTIFIED ARE 
MUSCLE AND BEARD 
WHAT THEY DRIVE FASTER WHEN THEY HEAR THOSE WORDS YEAH 
BUT THE INTERESTING THING IS HOLD ON A MINUTE 
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT IF I SEE HIM COMING THE OTHER WAY 
I WILL SPEED UP YES IT'S A BEARD IT IS A BEARD 
YOU WILL SPEED UP BY ONE MILE AN HOUR 
BUT THE CONVERSE IS TRUE 
BECAUSE THEY SLOW DOWN AGAIN IF THEY HEAR FEMININE WORDS SUCH AS 
PINK AND LIPSTICK 
IF I HEAR THE WORD LIPSTICK I JUST ASSUME MY DOG'S GOT EXCITED AGAIN 
I HAVE TO SAY THOUGH 
THIS WOULD BE BRILLIANT NEXT TIME HE GIVES US A LIFT 
AND WE WANT HIM TO SPEED UP I. E. ALWAYS 
WE JUST SIT IN THE BACK SHOUTING MANLY WORDS AT HIM 
WHAT JUST POWER DRILL WORK BOOTS 
WE COULD LOSE HIM HIS LICENCE 
WAIT UNTIL HE'S COMING UP TO A SPEED CAMERA AND WHISPER BIG PLIERS 
A HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR JAMES MAY JUST IN A FLUSTER 
AND THEN WHEN WE WANT HIM TO SLOW DOWN WE USE FEMININE WORDS 
PINK FLUFFY JOKING APART I THINK THIS IS QUITE INTERESTING 
IF WE ACTUALLY SAID BRA YOU'D SCREECH TO A HALT IMMEDIATELY 
BUT I THINK THE REASON THAT I TEND TO DRIVE MAYBE A BIT TOO SLOWLY 
IS THAT I'M ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT THE JOHN LEWIS KITCHEN DEPARTMENT 
O. K. NOW LISTEN 
LAST WEEK WE WENT TO BOTSWANA I HOPE YOU SAW IT 
AND THE IDEA OF THE STORY WAS THAT YOU DON'T NEED A FOUR WHEEL DRIVE CAR TO DRIVE OFF ROAD 
AND YOU'D BE AMAZED HOW LONG AN OLD CAR CAN BE KEPT GOING EVEN WHEN YOU THINK IT'S DEAD 
UNFORTUNATELY IT BECAME REALLY A LOVE STORY 
IT WAS THE STORY OF A YOUNG MAN WHO WENT OUT THERE TO AFRICA 
AND HANG ON A MINUTE WHAT 
BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN IMPROVE THIS WITH AN OLD TOP GEAR PROP 
WHAT OLD TOP GEAR PROP HANG ON I'LL FIND IT 
YOU'RE AN OLD TOP GEAR PROP 
AH NOW THAT THIS'LL IMPROVE IT IMMENSELY 
I'LL START AGAIN WOULD YOU YEAH WAIT FOR IT O. K. 
SO IT'S THE STORY OF A YOUNG CHAP 
WHO WENT TO AFRICA AND FELL IN LOVE WITH A FORTY THREE YEAR OLD OPAL CADET 
CALLED OLIVER 
AND THEY WOULD SIT FOR MANY HOURS UNDER THE STARS 
TELLING EACH OTHER THEY HAD EYES LIKE POOLS OF MOONLIGHT 
AND NOW HE'S DECIDED TO SHIP HIM HANG ON 
HIM SHIP IT BACK TO ENGLAND HAVEN'T YOU YEAH I HAVE 
IT'S COMING HOME ARE YOU GOING TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY TOGETHER 
EMBROIDER CHURCH KNEELERS ARE YOU SURE THIS ISN'T JUST THE TYPICAL HOLIDAY ROMANCE 
WHEN YOU WERE OUT THERE YOU THOUGHT HE HAD A LOVELY MOUSTACHE 
BUT GET HIM HOME AND HE'LL BE HORRID RICHARD 
HE ONLY WANTS A BRITISH PASSPORT 
YEAH 
OR AN M. O. T. LISTEN IT'S REAL 
AND HE LOVES ME AND HE'S COMING HOME 
THAT'S A FACT AWW 
I'M GOING TO BE SICK 
LOOK AT HIM THERE HE IS 
HE'S ON A BOAT RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK I KNOW 
NO YOU'RE NOT OFFLOADING HIM BRISTOL AND I KNOW WHEN 
OH GOD 
ANYWAY LET'S MOVE IT ON SHALL WE 
GO ON YES NOW YOU MAY REMEMBER THE FIRST PROGRAMME OF THIS SERIES 
WHEN WE WENT OVER TO EUROPE AND DROVE ALL AROUND THE PLACE 
TO FIND FABULOUS DRIVING ROADS IN THOSE LIGHTWEIGHT SUPERCARS 
AND WE HEARD FROM A CHAP WHO DID THE SAME 
WE'D SAID LOOK DO IT IT'S BRILLIANT AND A CHAP DID 
AND HE'S SENT US HIS HOLIDAY PHOTOGRAPHS HERE HE IS 
ON THE FIRST DAY OF HIS TRIP AT THE STELVIO PASS WHERE WE WERE 
WITH HIS LAMBORGHINI AND HE ALSO SENT US A PHOTO OF 
HOW IT ENDED UP ON HIS HOLIDAY HERE IT IS 
THE THOUGHTS HE'S HAVING ABOUT TOP GEAR NOW ARE NOT GENEROUS 
NOT GOOD NOW THE POLICE IN HAMPSHIRE ARE RUNNING AN ADVERT 
OF A JOLLY POLICEMAN IN HIS TALL HELMET ON THE BACK OF A BUS 
WE'VE GOT IT HERE 
IT'S FINE EXCEPT FOR WHERE THE BUS'S EXHAUST PIPE IS 
THERE'S HIS NO 
OH THAT POOR MAN IMAGINE DRIVING BEHIND THAT 
THERE'S ME THERE'S MY SMALL METAL PENIS 
HE WILL BE THE CROSSEST POLICEMAN IN THE WORLD 
IF YOU GET PULLED BY HIM IT'S BAD NEWS IF YOU GET PULLED BY HIM FOR SPEEDING 
DON'T SAY AREN'T YOU THE ONE WITH THE EXHAUST PIPE FOR A PENIS 
NOW LISTEN YOU KNOW YOU TWO YOU KNOW LONDON WELL ENOUGH YEAH 
NAME FOR ME WHAT YOU THINK IS THE TRADITIONAL LONDON MINICAB 
WHAT CAR TOYOTA CAMRY NISSAN PRIMERA YEAH HYUNDAI SONATA 
YOU'RE WRONG WHERE ARE MY GLASSES NOT AGAIN 
HERE WE GO SOMEBODY HAS COMPILED O. K. 
A LIST OF MINICABS REGISTERED IN LONDON I'VE GOT THEM HERE 
SEVENTEEN OF THEM ARE BENTLEY CONTINENTAL G. T.'S 
THREE ARE MAYBACHS THE BIG ONES THE SIXTY TWOS 
AND THERE ARE EIGHT TWO SEATER MERC S. L.'S 
MINICABS WANNA KNOW WHY YES 
BECAUSE IF YOU REGISTER YOUR CAR AS A MINICAB 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE CONGESTION CHARGE 
BUT YEAH BUT HANG ON 
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO REGISTER YOUR CAR AS A MINICAB 
O. K. CONGESTION CHARGE EIGHT A DAY 
THAT'S GOING UP BUT IT'S EIGHT A DAY NOW 
THAT'S FORTY A WEEK 
IT COSTS TWENTY SEVEN A YEAR TO REGISTER AS A MINICAB 
AND WITH A ONE OFF APPLICATION FEE OF EIGHTY TWO 
BUT HANG ON YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO USE YOUR CAR AS A MINICAB 
WELL THEY'RE GONNA SAY ARE YOU A MINICAB DRIVER YEAH 
WE'RE GONNA TEST YOU DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING NO YOU ARE THEN 
DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A POOL OF SICK AND A BEADED SEAT COVER IN YOUR CAR 
TO QUALIFY I HOPE NOT BECAUSE FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING 
THEY'RE GETTING AN APPLICATION FOR A LAMBORGHINI GALLARDO SPYDER MINICAB 
I LOOK FORWARD TO FALLING OUT OF A KEBAB SHOP AND VOMITING IN IT 
I VOMITED IN IT JUST NOW SO IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE 
ER BRIEFLY TO TALK ABOUT A CAR OH YES THAT WAS A GOOD ONE 
MITSUBISHI YOU KNOW MAKERS OF THE EVO AND ALL THAT 
THEY'VE NOW INTRODUCED A NEW TURBO CHARGED MID ENGINE CAR 
YEAH DO YOU WANNA SEE IT YEAH HERE IT IS 
IT'S CALLED THE I. COS 
NO HOLD ON BECAUSE 
O. K. IT MIGHT BE UGLY BUT AT LEAST IT'S SLOW 
SIXTY FOUR BRAKE HORSEPOWER 
BUT IT'S GOT SOME CLEVER BITS AND PIECES 
IT'S GOT A SPECIAL FILTER ON THE AIR CONDITIONING 
THAT AND I QUOTE IS OF MAJOR BENEFIT TO ALLERGY SUFFERERS 
I'M ALLERGIC TO BILL ODDIE WILL IT STOP HIM GETTING IN 
BILL ODDIE CANNOT BE BLOWN THROUGH THE FILTER VENTS AT YOU 
THE FILTER GETS RID LIKE IT IT'S VERY GOOD 
IT'S ALSO GOT HYPOALLERGENIC SEATS THAT GIVE YOU ECZEMA NO 
CHLAMYDIA NO 
NO THEY STOP YOUR ECZEMA AND IT'S GOT A DEODORISING ROOF LINING 
A HA I WAS READING ABOUT THAT THE OTHER DAY 
IF YOU BREAK WIND FOR INSTANCE IN THAT CAR 
THE SMELLS ARE ABSORBED INTO THE ROOF LINING IT'S TRUE HONESTLY 
IT'S DEODORISING THAT'S WHAT IT DOES 
SO THE SEATS ABSORB YOUR ECZEMA 
AND THE ROOF LINING ABSORBS YOUR FARTS 
WHICH IS VERY CLEVER 
BUT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO BUY ONE SECOND HAND WOULD YOU 
NO 
RIGHT IT'S NOW TIME TO MOVE ON AND FOR ME TO DRIVE A CAR 
IT'S CALLED THE CAPARO T. ONE AND IT'S POSSIBLY THE MOST AMAZING 
MAYBE THE FASTEST 
AND ALMOST CERTAINLY THE SCARIEST CAR EVER MADE 
REMARKABLE LOOKING THING ISN'T IT 
AND EVEN MORE REMARKABLE WHEN YOU NOTICE IT HAS LIGHTS AND INDICATORS 
AND SPACE FOR A PASSENGER 
WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT IS THE FIRST REALISTIC ATTEMPT 
TO MAKE A FORMULA ONE STYLE CAR THAT YOU CAN USE ON THE ROAD 
IT HASN'T HAD A PARTICULARLY EASY BIRTH 
AT THE LAUNCH A DUTCH JOURNALIST WAS IN IT WHEN SOME ASPECT OF THE FRONT SUSPENSION CAME ADRIFT 
AND IT SPEARED OFF INTO THE UNDERGROWTH 
THEN AT THE GOODWOOD FESTIVAL OF SPEED THE THROTTLE JAMMED WIDE OPEN 
AND THAT HAPPENED AGAIN WHEN FIFTH GEAR WERE TESTING IT 
AND THEN AT ONE FIFTY M. P. H. IT CAUGHT FIRE MASSIVELY 
BURNING THE DRIVER QUITE BADLY ON THE HAND THE NECK AND THE FACE 
AND NOW IT IS MY TURN 
BECAUSE OF THIS CAR'S VIOLENT HISTORY AND THE IMMENSE SPEEDS IT CAN ACHIEVE 
THE B. B. C. HAS INSISTED WE BEEF UP OUR SAFETY PRECAUTIONS 
THIS IS WHAT WE NORMALLY USE A VAN WITH SOME STICKING PLASTERS AND ASPIRIN IN IT 
TODAY THOUGH WE HAVE ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH A MEDIUM SIZED PLANE CRASH 
CAPARO THEMSELVES SAY I AM NOT ALLOWED TO DRIVE IT UNLESS I WEAR A FULL FACE CRASH HELMET 
AND ONE OF THESE ROMPER SUITS PRESUMABLY SO THAT IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG 
ALL MY ORGANS WILL BE HELD TOGETHER IN ONE SORT OF BIG FIREPROOF BAG 
MAKING IT EASIER TO COLLECT 
SO EVERYTHING IS IN PLACE 
I AM IN 
FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE TO PUT THE STEERING WHEEL ON 
IT GOES ON THE OTHER WAY UP 
SEAT BELTS 
RIGHT ON THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER SYSTEM MASTER SWITCH ON IGNITION 
IT'S A ROAD CAR SO IT WILL PROBABLY BE QUITE QUIET 
HERE WE GO 
AND BURST INTO LIFE 
NO IT ISN'T QUIET 
IF THIS ALL GOES WRONG I'LL DO THE TEAM AMERICA SECRET SIGNAL 
O. K. PEEP PEEP 
HORN WORKS 
HERE WE GO 
WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUSS IS ALL ABOUT THIS IS VERY SAFE 
I CAN SEE NO DANGER HERE AT ALL 
DESIGNED BY THE PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT YOU THE MCLAREN F. ONE THE CAPARO HAS A THIRTY FIVE LITRE V. EIGHT RACE ENGINE 
WHICH DELIVERS FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE HORSEPOWER 
THAT IS A HUGE AMOUNT IN A CAR THAT WEIGHS ABOUT THE SAME AS A PATIO HEATER 
AS A RESULT IT HAS TWICE AS MUCH BRAKE HORSEPOWER PER TONNE 
AS A BUGATTI VEYRON TWICE AS MUCH 
IN A ROAD CAR THAT IS A TRULY TERRIFYING PROSPECT 
SO FAR ALL FOUR WHEELS ARE STILL ON YEAH 
THE THROTTLE HAS NOT JAMMED OPEN 
AND THERE IS NO FIRE 
SO GOODBYE SAFETY PEOPLE 
OH MY GOD GOD ALMIGHTY 
YOU CAN FORGET ENZOS 
YOU CAN FORGET EVERYTHING THIS IS IN A DIFFERENT LEAGUE 
IT DOES NOUGHT TO SIXTY IN TWO AND A HALF SECONDS 
NOUGHT TO ONE HUNDRED IN FIVE AND IT WILL STILL BE GOING LIKE A BEE OUT OF HELL 
ALL THE WAY UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIVE 
WHERE HOPEFULLY THE TWIN TAIL PLANES LIKE YOU GET ON AN S. R. SEVENTY ONE BLACKBIRD SPY PLANE 
WILL KEEP IT STABLE 
I AM BRAKING OH GOD 
YOU COULDN'T STOP MORE QUICKLY IF YOU RAN INTO A TREE 
TO EXPERIENCE ANYTHING LIKE THIS YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE 
IN A FORMULA THREE THOUSAND CAR 
THIS IS ACCELERATION LIKE I HAVE NEVER EVER EXPERIENCED 
AND THEN THE FLOOR CAME OFF 
I AM GOING TO DO THE SECRET SIGNAL 
THANKFULLY IT WASN'T A BIG JOB 
AND SOON THE T. ONE WAS BACK 
AND THEN THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE FUEL IT WASN'T TURNING OUT TO BE VERY RELIABLE THIS 
AND THEN THERE IS THE PRICE 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO SOFTEN THE BLOW ON THIS SO I'LL COME STRAIGHT OUT WITH IT 
IT'S TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND 
REALLY THEN THE ONLY PEOPLE FIT BRAVE AND RICH ENOUGH TO BUY SUCH A CAR ARE PREMIERSHIP FOOTBALLERS 
I AM SURE MR. ROONEY WILL LIKE THE SPEED AND THE LOOKS VERY MUCH 
BUT HE IS IN FOR A NASTY SURPRISE WHEN HE GETS IT BACK FROM THE MENDER'S 
BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT AS GOOD AT TAKING CORNERS AS HE IS 
OH NO THAT IS A LOT OF UNDER STEER 
THAT IS A LOT OF UNDER STEER 
I AM FEELING THE POWER BUT THERE IS SO MUCH POWER IN THIS 
I AM JUST GOING TO SPIN OUT OH GOD THIS IS A DISASTER 
THE SHAPE HAS BEEN DESIGNED SO THE AIR FLOWING OVER IT 
WILL PRESS THE CAR INTO THE ROAD 
IT WILL ACTUALLY GENERATE THREE G. IN A FAST BEND 
UNFORTUNATELY IN A SLOW BEND THE AIR ISN'T MOVING OVER THE BODY QUICKLY ENOUGH 
AND YOU HAVE ALMOST NO GRIP AT ALL 
LOOK AT IT SNAKING FIGHTING FOR GRIP THAT JUST ISN'T THERE 
IF THE TYRES ARE COLD THE PROBLEM IS TEN TIMES WORSE 
IF THE ROAD IS WET IT'LL SPIN UP THE REARS THROUGH THIRD AND FOURTH 
IF YOU TRY TO GO ROUND A NORMAL ROUNDABOUT AT A NORMAL SPEED IN THIS 
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A HUGE ACCIDENT 
WHEN THIS THING GOES ON SALE THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE A DITCH IN THE LAND OR A HEDGEROW 
THAT ISN'T FULL OF FOOTBALLERS ALL BROKEN AND ON FIRE 
BECAUSE OF THIS CAR I WOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED IF GRIMSBY TOWN WON THIS YEAR'S F. A. CUP 
HANG ON TO GENERATE ENOUGH DOWN FORCE TO GET ROUND A CORNER YOU HAVE TO GO REALLY FAST YES 
BRILLIANT EXCUSE FOR THE POLICE I HAD TO GO ROUND THE CORNER OFFICER AT ONE ZERO ZERO ZERO M. P. H. 
DOING THIRTY I'D HAVE CRASHED 
THE THING I LIKE IS THAT IT IS AMAZING THAT THIS IS ALLOWED 
THERE'S A REGULATION THAT SAYS THAT HEADLIGHT HAS TO BE THAT HEIGHT 
THEY HAVE TO PUT THE SEATBELTS IN BUT THERE ARE NO LAWS GOVERNING HOW FAST IT CAN GO NO 
AND WE MUST NOW FIND OUT HOW FAST IT CAN GO ROUND OUR TRACK 
WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO HAND IT OVER TO SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS DOWN FORCE 
SOME SAY THAT TO UNLOCK HIM YOU RUN YOUR FINGER DOWN HIS FACE 
LIKE THAT 
AND THAT IF HE WERE GETTING DIVORCED FROM PAUL MCCARTNEY HE'D KEEP HIS STUPID WHINING MOUTH SHUT 
ALL WE KNOW IS HE'S CALLED THE STING 
AND HE'S OFF LITTLE BIT OF WHEEL SPIN THERE 
NOW HE'S HEADING FOR THE FIRST CORNER 
FAIRLY FAST SHOULD BE JUST ENOUGH DOWN FORCE TO GET HIM ROUND 
LOOK AT THE SPEED HE'S GOING THE TAIL KICKED OUT A LITTLE BIT 
IT'S SNAKING 
NOW HE'S GOT TO BUILD UP THE SPEED AGAIN HE'S GOT NO STEREO TODAY SO NO SELF HELP 
AS HE TURNS INTO CHICAGO RUNNING A A BIT WIDE THE UNDER STEER KICKING IN NOT MUCH HE CAN DO ABOUT THAT 
NOW BACK ON THAT THREE LITRE ENGINE INTO THE HAMMERHEAD TURNING HE'S GONG TO BE IN SERIOUS BOTHER HERE 
UNDER STEER AGAIN THEN OVER STEER THEN UNDER STEER THEN OVER STEER 
NOW HE CAN GET BACK ON THE POWER THIS WILL BE PHENOMENAL TO FOLLOW THROUGH 
THREE G. THROUGH THERE EASY PEASY 
GETTING ON FOR FORMULA ONE LEVELS OF GRIP THAT'S QUICK 
NOW HE'S GOT MORE BOTHER AGAIN 
COS HE'S GOT TO GO SLOWLY FOR THE SECOND TO LAST CORNER TURNING IN 
HELD THAT ONE VERY NICELY LAST CORNER 
AGAIN RUNNING WIDE AND ACROSS THE LINE 
THIS IS DESPITE THE HANDLING ISSUES WE ARE EXPECTING THIS TO BE PRETTY FAST 
MIXING IT UP HERE WITH THE TOP CROWD 
THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEENS THE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEENS THE ONE HUNDRED NINETEENS 
IT ACTUALLY DID IT IN ONE MINUTE TEN POINTS 
STAGGERING ABSOLUTELY STAGGERING 
THAT'S THE FASTEST THING BY MILES AND NOW I AM GOING TO TAKE IT OFF AGAIN 
WHAT 
YOU KNOW THE RULES JAMES 
IF A CAR CAN'T GET OVER A SLEEPING POLICEMAN IT CAN'T GO ON THAT BOARD 
WE'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT AND LOOK AT THE NOSE ON THIS 
YOU'D RIP THAT OFF IF YOU RAN OVER GHANDI 
SO SORRY ABOUT THAT AND NOW WE'RE MOVING ON BECAUSE IT IS TIME TO PUT A STAR IN OUR REASONABLY PRICED CAR 
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A VERY BUSY MAN 
SO BUSY THAT THE ONLY HOLE WE COULD FIND IN HIS DIARY WAS TWO WEEKS AGO 
SO WE INTERVIEWED HIM THEN AND THEN WE THOUGHT WE'D SLIDE IT INTO TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME 
AND NOBODY WOULD BE ANY THE WISER 
I'VE HAD MY HAIR CUT TO MATCH I AM WEARING ROUGHLY THE SAME CLOTHES WE'RE IN THE SAME BUILDING 
IT WAS ALL VERY AMBITIOUS BUT AS IS SO OFTEN THE WAY WITH TOP GEAR 
I AM AFRAID IT HASN'T QUITE WORKED 
BECAUSE IF YOU WATCH VERY CAREFULLY 
THIS POPPY IS ABOUT TO MAGICALLY DISAPPEAR 
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN FROM THE PAST SIMON COWELL 
WELCOME BACK 
HOW ARE YOU HOW ARE YOU VERY GOOD THANK YOU HAVE A SEAT 
NOT YOUR FIRST VISIT OF COURSE 
I WAS HERE WAS IT FOUR YEARS AGO YES WHEN WE HAD THE SUZUKI LIANA 
WE'VE MOVED ON NOW OH YOU'VE REALLY MOVED UP IN THE WORLD 
ABSOLUTELY AND SO HAVE YOU 
BECAUSE THEN IT WAS POP IDOL WASN'T IT YES SECOND POP IDOL 
AND SINCE THEN YOU'VE GOT AMERICAN INVENTOR BRITISH INVENTOR 
AMERICAN IDOL X. FACTOR HOW MANY MORE OPPORTUNITIES ARE THERE FOR YOU TO GET MONEY FROM PHONE LINES 
WHERE PEOPLE VOTE ON THINGS 
WE ONLY DO THE PHONE LINES SO THE AUDIENCE CAN VOTE SO WE'RE GIVING SOMETHING BACK TO THE AUDIENCE 
YOU CAN DO AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ONE A WHAT WHERE PEOPLE COMPETE 
FOR A BRITISH PASSPORT

I AM THINKING I MIGHT DO IT IT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA 
IT'S FANTASTIC IT'S YOURS 
I MEAN I JUST HAVE IDEAS ALL THE TIME O. K. THEY'RE NOT VERY GOOD 
WHAT AND X. FACTOR IS 
YEAH YES 
WHY ARE THEY CLAPPING 
COME ON FAIR'S FAIR

WE'VE GOT TO HELP A POOR STRUGGLING PROGRAMME LIKE X. FACTOR COS YOU'VE NEARLY GOT AS MANY VIEWERS AS US 
NO WE GET MORE THAN YOU 
SORRY OURS IS A BETTER PROGRAMME NO IT'S NOT 
YOU RECKON THERE ARE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN TOP GEAR AND X. FACTOR 
THE PANEL ARE SIMILAR I CAN SEE SIMILARITIES IN THE PANEL 
JAMES IS LOUIS 
IN SO MANY WAYS 
IN SO MUCH AS HE HASN'T GOT A MASSIVE EGO DOESN'T REALLY CARE TOO MUCH ABOUT BEING ON T. V. 
MM HMM LITTLE BIT GREY 
RICHARD IS DANNII 
SMALL BUT CUTE 
WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE 
AND I REALLY DO MEAN THAT BY THE WAY 
I TELL YOU WHY I SAY THAT 
ANYONE IN THIS AUDIENCE COULD DO WHAT YOU DO 
WHICH IS SIT IN A CAR AND GO I LIKE IT I DON'T LIKE IT 
YOU'VE NEVER MADE A CAR 
I TALK ABOUT MUSIC BUT I HAVE ACTUALLY MADE IT HAPPEN 
THAT'S RIGHT YOU DID THE MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS

THAT WE ARE BOTH QUITE OUTSPOKEN BUT I AM THE ONE WITH THE ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE 
I'M SORRY MATE I'M 
WE TOUCHED ON THIS LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE ABOUT MUSICAL TASTE MM 
YOURS IS TERRIBLE 
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY COULD I BE A JUDGE ON X. FACTOR 
SHALL I TELL YOU WHY YOU COULDN'T WHY 
BECAUSE I AM AGEING QUITE WELL AND YOU ARE NOT 
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU THE OTHER DAY I WAS READING ONE OF YOUR REVIEWS 
ABOUT A JAGUAR ABOUT HOW JAGUARS HAVE TO UPDATE THEMSELVES OVER THE YEARS 
M. M. M. 
AND YOU ARE THE EQUIVALENT OF A JAGUAR WHO NEEDS HELP 
IN OTHER WORDS YOU KNOW HOW YOU DO A FACELIFT ON THE NEW JAG 
OH I CAN'T DO A FACELIFT 
NO YOU DO YOU NEED BOTOX YOU NEED A FACELIFT 
JUST HAVE HALF AN EYE DONE OR SOMETHING 
I LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND JUST GO 
NO I'M FALLING TO PIECES AND I DON'T CARE 
NO I DON'T THINK THAT YOU CARE 
I THINK I LOOK GOOD 
YOU DO LOOK GOOD BUT I KNOW I DO AND WE'RE THE SAME AGE 
AND I DON'T CARE YOU MUST DO SHOULD I CARE ABOUT IT

AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID ON THE SHOW 
ABOUT IT BEING BETTER THAN A PORSCHE 
M. M. M. AND I WAS THINKING WHY IS IT BETTER THAN A PORSCHE 
THE REASON IT'S BETTER THAN A PORSCHE IS THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU IN IT 
I PROMISE YOU AT THAT SPLIT SECOND SOMEONE OVERTOOK ME 
PUT THEIR HAND OUT THE WINDOW AND WENT TOSSER 
AT EXACTLY THAT MOMENT PERHAPS TELLING YOU TO PUT YOUR SEATBELT ON

BECAUSE AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY 
WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING IT AROUND THE TRACK HERE IT'S FANTASTIC 
DRIVING IT IN LONDON IT'S IMPOSSIBLE WHY 
YOU CAN'T DO MORE THAN TEN MILES AN HOUR IN THIS CAR 
IT'S LIKE NAOMI CAMPBELL PHONING YOU UP GOING OUT FOR DINNER

THE STIG SAID YOU HAVE GOT A KNACK 
THE CAMERAMEN SAID THEY'D NEVER SEEN CONSISTENCY LIKE IT IN THE PRACTICE LAPS 
YOU SHOULD NEVER LISTEN TO WHAT YOU'RE BEING TOLD 
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE RIDING A BICYCLE IF SOMEONE TELLS YOU HOW TO DO IT 
YOU START THINKING ABOUT TOO MANY THINGS 
SO YOU'VE JUST GOT TO GET YOURSELF ROUND 
BUT I'M GENUINELY THRILLED I'M GLAD I CAME 
I'M VERY GLAD COS I WAS GETTING BORED WITH HAVING A SCOT 
NOT ONLY IN NUMBER TEN BUT ALSO AT THE TOP OF OUR LEADERBOARD 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SIMON COWELL 
I'M SO HAPPY WELL DONE 
WOW WHAT A NIGHT THE RECORDS ARE JUST TUMBLING 
FIRST THE CAPARO BLITZES THE KOENIGSEGG ROUND THE TRACK 
NOW WE'VE GOT A NEW FASTEST LAP IT'S 
YEAH HELLO MY POPPY'S GROWN BACK 
IT'S A MIRACLE YOU ARE SUCH A CLOT 
I AM AND NOW IT IS TIME FOR ONE OF OUR EPIC RACES 
YOU KNOW THE SORT OF THING 
WHERE A BUGATTI RACES ACROSS THE ALPS AGAINST A TRUFFLE 
OR A MCLAREN MERCEDES RACES A POWERBOAT TO OSLO 
OH YES AND THIS ONE ISN'T THAT BIG TO BE HONEST 
BUT IT IS MORE RELEVANT BECAUSE IT'S A RACE TO FIND OUT 
WHAT IS THE QUICKEST WAY TO CROSS A BUSY CITY 
CAR BICYCLE PUBLIC TRANSPORT WHATEVER 
WE'VE CHOSEN LONDON WE START FROM KEW BRIDGE 
WHICH IS THE MOST WESTERLY POINT OF THE NORTH CIRCULAR 
WHICH IF YOU LIVE IN NEPAL OR COVENTRY 
IS A SORT OF RING ROAD AROUND LONDON 
AND WE THEN FINISH UP OVER HERE AT LONDON'S CITY AIRPORT 
WHICH IS AT THE MOST EASTERLY POINT OF THE NORTH CIRCULAR 
SO THAT IS A RACE RIGHT ACROSS THE CENTRE 
OF ONE OF THE MOST CONGESTED CITIES IN THE WORLD 
NOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AREN'T ACCUSED OF BIAS TOWARDS THE CAR 
IT WILL BE DRIVEN BY THE SLOWEST MAN IN THE WORLD 
A MAN WITH NO KNOWN SENSE OF DIRECTION 
HIM 
TO MAKE IT EVEN LESS FAIR THE CAR THEY'VE GIVEN ME IS NOT A SMART CAR 
OR MY FIAT PANDA OR ANYTHING SENSIBLE LIKE THAT IT'S THIS 
THE NEW MERCEDES G. L. IT'S SEVENTEEN FEET LONG 
IT'S ABOUT SIX AND A HALF FEET WIDE IT WEIGHS TWO AND A HALF TONS 
IT IS THE CHELSEA IST OF ALL THE CHELSEA TRACTORS 
AND I SHALL ATTEMPT TO BEAT HIM ON THIS 
IT'S A SPECIALISED SERIES LIMITED 
A CARBON FIBRE SUPER LIGHTWEIGHT BICYCLE 
IT'S BUILT ON A FIVE PIECE CONSTRUCTION 
WITH A BODY GEOMETRY SADDLE 
IT'S GOT CARBON FIBRE CRANKS AIR CARBON FIBRE HANDLEBARS 
CARBON FIBRE BRAKE LEVERS 
AND IT'S EVEN GOT ITS OWN UNIQUE GEL BASED SUSPENSION SYSTEM 
SO IT CAN COPE WITH THE BUMPS OF LONDON 
IT'S ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED IT IS QUITE EXPENSIVE YES 
ANYWAY THIS ISN'T JUST A RACE BETWEEN A CAR AND A BIKE 
COS WE NEED TO SEE HOW PUBLIC TRANSPORT WILL FARE 
SO WE NEED A THIRD PERSON 
SOMEONE WHO'S NEVER BEEN ON A TRAIN OR A BUS 
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW THE MISERY 
THANKFULLY WE HAVE JUST SUCH A PERSON 
NOW AS WE RACE ACROSS LONDON IN THE CAR AND ON THE BIKE 
HE WILL CATCH A BUS AROUND THE CORNER 
THEN HE WILL GET AN UNDERGROUND TRAIN TO MONUMENT STATION 
AND FROM THERE HE WILL GET ON THE DOCKLANDS LIGHT RAILWAY 
WHICH TAKES HIM TO THE AIRPORT ARE WE READY 
YES READY 
LET'S GO EXCELLENT OH HANG ON 
HANG ON THERE IS A FOURTH WAY 
OH GOD 
DON'T TELL ME A JET PACK 
NO HARRIER JUMP JET NO PLASMA POWERED HORSE NO 
I'VE GOT A BOAT HOW WILL YOU GET A BOAT UP KNIGHTSBRIDGE 
I'M NOT THE RIVER THAMES IS JUST UP THERE 
IT GOES ALL THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT 
LIKE A BLUE MOTORWAY 
SO YOU ARE GOING TO ROW UP THE THAMES DOING ONE MILE AN HOUR 
IT'S GOT AN ENGINE 
ALL WE KNOW IS THIS HAMMOND IT'S EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY TWO YES ON A MONDAY MORNING 
YEAH PEAK RUSH HOUR I'D CALL HUMID 
SWEATY YES 
SO WE GENUINELY HAVE NO IDEA WHO'S GOING TO WIN THIS I AM 
YOU'RE NOT I KNOW FULL WELL YOU'RE NOT I AM 
ARE WE READY YES WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT 
THREE TWO HANG ON HE'S JUMPING THE GUN GO NOW 
O. K. NO RUSH 
I'M GONNA CREAM IT 
SEE YOU HAMMOND 
THAT'S THE LAST TIME YOU'RE IN THE LEAD 
SO WHAT I'VE GOT IS A GENTLE WALK TO THE RIVER ON THE BOAT 
THROUGH THE CITY IT'S A LOVELY DAY 
SEE YOU MATE 
HAMMOND SHOT PAST THE TRAFFIC ON KEW BRIDGE 
I HONESTLY THINK I CAN WIN THIS ONE 
CAPTAIN SLOW WAS ALSO FULL OF HOPE THIS IS A CAR 
THIS IS A CAR PROGRAMME I KNOW YOU WANT THE CAR TO WIN 
I WANT THE CAR TO WIN I SHALL NOT LET YOU DOWN 
I HAVE A ROUGH IDEA WHERE I'M GOING 
I KNOW THE RIVER'S ON MY RIGHT NO IT'S ON THE RIGHT 
SADLY THOUGH BOTH OF THEM WERE GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTED 
LET'S GO 
O. K. WHAT I'VE GOT HERE IS A FIFTY TWO THOUSAND COUGAR SPORT RACING BOAT 
IT'S GOT A THREE AND A HALF LITRE V. TECH HONDA ENGINE ON THE BACK 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BRAKE HORSEPOWER TOP SPEED SEVENTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR 
UNFORTUNATELY ON THIS PART OF THE RIVER SORT OF CHISWICK 
THERE ARE MANY HERONS AND OTTERS 
SO I'M LIMITED TO NINE MILES AN HOUR ISH 
THE SPEED LIMIT IS ENFORCED ALL THE WAY TO WANDSWORTH BRIDGE 
BUT FROM THERE THE THAMES HAS NO SPEED LIMIT AT ALL 
BYE BYE GOOD LUCK ON THE BUS 
MEANWHILE THE STIG SAW A HUGE RED CAR APPROACHING 
AND HE GOT ON IT USING SOMETHING CALLED AN OYSTER CARD 
WHICH IS USEFUL IF YOU HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING OF MONEY 
I'M IN A BUS LANE WHICH IS GOOD I CAN USE THEM 
HOWEVER THE OTHER THING THAT USES THEM BUSES 
THE MONDAY MORNING RUSH HOUR WAS SLOWING JAMES 
BUT I COULDN'T OPEN UP THE BIG LEAD I'D HOPED FOR 
FOR ONE SIMPLE REASON 
I'VE GOT TO WAIT AT THE LIGHTS I'M ON TELLY 
I ALWAYS WAIT AT THE LIGHTS 
HELLO OH 
WITH THE CAR POTTERING ALONG NICELY 
I DECIDED TO SEE IF HAMMOND WAS AS COMFORTABLE AS ME 
HAMMOND 
HELLO HAMMOND 
NOW HERE'S ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS THAT YOU HAVE ON THE RIVER 
WHICH IS THE ROWERS 
WHO RESERVE A SPECIAL KIND OF HATRED FOR PEOPLE WITH ENGINES ON THEIR BOATS 
THEY ARE THE CYCLISTS OF THE WATERWAY THE HAMMONDS 
DO YOU WANT A LIFT 
SEE SHE HATES ME 
CHANGE CHANGE I'M BLOODY CYCLING IT'S HARD WORK 
YOU CAN GO FASTER COS YOU'VE GOT BANDY LEGS 
I CAN'T GO FASTER I HAVEN'T GOT BANDY LEGS 
IT WAS TIME FOR THE STIG TO GET OUT OF THE BIG RED CAR 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PLEASE KEEP YOUR BELONGINGS WITH YOU 
SINCE I WAS STUCK AT NINE AND ALMOST CERTAINLY LAST 
I DECIDED TO REVIVE THE ANCIENT ART OF USING A TELEPHONE WHILE DRIVING 
JAMES HELLO CAPTAIN CLARKSON 
WHERE ARE YOU HAMMERSMITH YEAH HAMMERSMITH BROADWAY 
NO WAY 
WHERE'S HAMMOND I TRIED TO RING HIM 
BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE HIS FACE WAS RUBBING ALONG THE ROAD 
SO HE MAY HAVE HAD IT ALREADY 
JAMES I HAVE TO BEAT YOU 
BUT I WANT YOU TO WIN WITH THAT CAR DON'T GET LOST 
TO MAKE SURE I DIDN'T GET LOST I WAS USING THE SAT NAV 
KEEP LEFT THEN KEEP RIGHT I KNOW 
I'M KEEPING RIGHT I KNEW THAT I WAS ALREADY KEEPING RIGHT 
PLEASE KEEP LEFT IN ONE HUNDRED YARDS' 
EXACTLY YOU GO DOWN THERE TOWARDS 
MY PHONE'S GOING HELLO HAMMOND 
HOW'S IT GOING MATE 
OH NO 
NO 
OH THAT WAS THE SOUND OF A SKULL UNDER A BUS'S PIRELLI 
RIGHT TIME TO RING THE STIG 
SEE HOW HE'S GETTING ON 
WE'D GIVEN HIM A PHONE BUT ER 
AFTER TWENTY FIVE MINUTES THIS IS HOW THINGS STOOD 
HAMMOND WAS ALIVE AND IN THE LEAD 
MAY WAS BREATHING DOWN HIS NECK IN SECOND 
THE STIG WAS THIRD AND I WAS GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION 
ON ONE OF THE RIVER'S ENDLESS AND ANNOYING MEANDERS 
I HAVE TO MAKE EVERY MILE AN HOUR COUNT BECAUSE MY AVERAGE SPEED 
IS SO LOW 
DON'T PULL OUT DON'T PULL OUT DON'T PULL OUT 
I HATE BUSES 
STINKING HORRIBLE THINGS 
GO BIT OF CHRISTIAN MOTORING THERE THAT MAN WANTED TO PULL OUT 
LET HIM PULL OUT WHAT COMES AROUND GOES AROUND 
HE WHO IS LAST SHALL BE FIRST O. I. CHUFFING 
BUS DRIVING BULLYING NAZI 
WHY DON'T YOU JUST WAIT AND GIVE YOUR PASSENGERS A BETTER RIDE 
THE NEXT STATION IS STAMFORD BROOK 
THE STIG NOW IN AN UNDERGROUND CAR HAVE NOTICED THAT EVERYONE WAS DOING THE SAME THING 
THIS HAS TO BE THE MOST 
STRESS FREE AND RELAXING MONDAY MORNING RUSH HOUR COMMUTE 
SINCE THE DAWN OF CIVILISATION 
OH NOT ANOTHER SET OF SODDING LIGHTS 
OH BLOODY HELL 
HAVE A NICE WALK ENJOY YOURSELVES 
I KNEW MAY WAS GETTING STUCK AT THE LIGHTS TOO 
BUT GETTING UP TO SPEED AGAIN DIDN'T WEAR HIM OUT 
NOT THAT HE COULD GET UP TO ANY SORT OF SPEED IN THE FIRST PLACE 
NOW I'D NEVER TRY TO BAN PEOPLE FROM HAVING CARS LIKE THIS COS THAT WOULD BE LIKE COMMUNISM REALLY 
BUT I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ANYBODY WOULD HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR DRIVING AROUND TOWN 
BECAUSE IT'S SO BIG AND UNNECESSARY 
IT'S MORE THAN SIX FEET WIDE IT'S ALMOST SIX AND A HALF FEET WIDE 
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE 
THAT DOOR IS HALF THE WIDTH OF THAT WHOLE SCOOTER 
MEANWHILE THE STIG WAS PLAINLY BEMUSED BY A STRANGE NEW WORLD 
NO NO YOU FILTHY FOUL STINKING 
HAMMOND 
OH YOU STINKING EVI 
FOUL REEKING HELL MAKING 
HAMMOND'S STOPPED SWEARING LONG ENOUGH TO ANSWER THE PHONE HELLO 
HELLO YEAH WHAT 
I'M JUST COMING UP TO THE ALBERT HALL I WONDERED HOW YOU WERE DOING 
YOU'RE JUST BEHIND ME I'M STUCK AT THE LIGHTS AGAIN OOH RIGHT 
I'LL GIVE YOU A FRIENDLY PEEP AS I GO PAST I'LL KICK THE CRAP OUT OF YOUR CAR IF YOU DO 
THIRTY FIVE MINUTES INTO THE RACE AND RICHARD WAS STILL IN THE LEAD 
JAMES WAS STILL ON HIS TAIL THE STIG WAS STILL IN A TUNNEL 
AND I WAS STILL FOLLOWING A PATH FORGED BY NATURE AT NINE 
BUT I WASN'T WORRIED AT ALL 
HAMMOND BY NOW WILL JUST BE BATHED IN SWEAT 
HE IS SMELLY PEOPLE WILL VOMIT WHEN THEY GO NEAR HIM 
JAMES OF COURSE HE'LL END UP IN HUDDERSFIELD PERHAPS 
PONTEFRACT WHO KNOWS 
NOT THE CITY AIRPORT ER 
STIG DON'T KNOW MIGHT THINK HE'S A BRAZILIAN ELECTRICIAN 
AND THEN ME HAVING A LOVELY TIME AND I'M GOING TO WIN 
I WAS NOW SCYTHING DOWN PICCADILLY 
AND JOY OF JOYS THE TRAFFIC WAS HORRIBLE 
AS IT TURNED OUT JAMS WERE THE LEAST OF MY PROBLEMS 
OH CRIKEY IT'S THE ROZZERS 
THE POLICE ONLY WANTED TO CHECK THE PERMIT FOR OUR CAMERA CAR BUT IT STILL COST ME VALUABLE TIME 
SO ON THE BASIS THAT 
STOPPING HERE I'VE LOST ABOUT THREE OR FOUR MINUTES IN THE RACE 
AND THAT SORT OF CORRUPTS THE RESULT 
CAN WE JUST DO FOUR MINUTES OF BLUES AND TWOS AND I'LL FOLLOW YOU 
I CAN GIVE YOU A FIFTY NINETY T. H. S. TO SAY THAT I'VE STOPPED YOU 
AND THEN YOU CAN SUBMIT THAT TO YOUR SUPERIORS AS A RECORD OF ME STOPPING YOU WHAT 
I WAS PULLING FURTHER AHEAD 
CYCLE LANE ONE TWO THREE METRES OF IT AND THEN I'M BACK UNDER THAT BUS 
WITH PLOD OF MY BACK 
I NOW HAD TO PAY KEN LIVINGSTONE FOR PERMISSION TO SIT IN HIS JAMS 
I'M SORRY THAT WAS AN INCORRECT CONNECTION
