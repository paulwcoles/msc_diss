IT SAYS SOLDIERS WILL BE CALLED UPON TO MAKE PERSONAL SACRIFICES 
I'M KEN HAMES I WAS IN THE MILITARY FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS 
I SERVED IN THE ARMY ROYAL MARINES AND SPECIAL FORCES 
SINCE I LEFT SIX YEARS AGO 
I'VE USED MY SKILLS TO CARVE OUT A CAREER AS A MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER AND T. V. PRESENTER 
CHALLENGING OTHERS TO TEST THEIR OWN LIMITS 
I'VE BEEN REALLY LUCKY BUT OTHERS HAVEN'T 
SOME WHO SERVED THEIR COUNTRY DON'T HAVE THE MOST BASIC NECESSITY 
SHELTER 
ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT IN LONDON THERE ARE THOUGHT TO BE OVER ONE THOUSAND HOMELESS VETERANS' 
ONE THING I LEARNT IN THE ARMY 
IS THAT YOU NEVER LET YOUR MATES DOWN YOU NEVER LEAVE THEM BEHIND 
IF SOMEBODY DROPS WE CARRY THEM BACK TO SAFETY 
I WANT TO KNOW WHY SO MANY VETERANS ARE HOMELESS IF THEIR EXPERIENCE IN THE MILITARY HAS CAUSED IT 
ON MY JOURNEY I'LL BE FORCED TO CONFRONT MY OWN EXPERIENCES 
AM I THAT DIFFERENT TO BRITAIN'S HOMELESS SOLDIERS 
I DECIDED TO JOIN THE ARMY WHEN I WAS ABOUT FOURTEEN 
MY DAD GAVE ME SOME OLD BADGES AND BITS OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT 
AND IT WAS ADVENTURE I THINK THAT ATTRACTED ME 
DURING MY CAREER I SERVED IN NORTHERN IRELAND THE FALKLANDS AND THE GULF 
I FOUGHT ALONGSIDE MEN AND WOMEN WHO LIKE ME WERE PREPARED TO LAY DOWN THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR COUNTRY 
BUT IT'S NOT A ONE SIDED COMMITMENT 
IT'S PART OF THE MILITARY COVENANT THE TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD TERMS 
BY WHICH THE ARMY GOES TO WAR ON THE NATION'S BEHALF 
IT SAYS SOLDIERS WILL BE CALLED UPON TO MAKE PERSONAL SACRIFICES 
INCLUDING THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE 
AND IN RETURN THE NATION WILL LOOK AFTER THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES 
WHY ARE PEOPLE WHO SERVED WITH ME SLIPPING THROUGH THE CRACKS 
IN PARTS OF THE U. K. VETERANS ARE THOUGHT TO MAKE UP TWELVE PERCENT OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION 
HOLBORN VIADUCT IN LONDON IS ONE PLACE I'VE BEEN TOLD HOMELESS SOLDIERS SLEEP ROUGH 
IT'S A REALLY SAD OLD PLACE HERE IT STINKS OF URINE 
IT'S COLD IT'S MISERABLE 
IN THESE DOORWAYS THERE'S FAG BUTTS AND MATCHES 
EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE WERE HERE LAST NIGHT 
IT'S THE LAST PLACE I THINK ANYONE 
LET ALONE A SOLDIER SHOULD HAVE TO LIVE 
IT'S HERE UNDER THE VIADUCT THAT I FIND DAVIE PASCOE 
HE'S BEEN HOMELESS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ONE 
IN AND OUT OF HOSTELS AND LIVING ROUGH ON THE STREETS' 
HOW ARE YOU DOING PAL DO YOU WANT A FAG DO YOU WANT A REAL ONE 
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT TO LOOK AT HIM BUT DAVIE WHO'S FORTY ONE 
COMES FROM A FAMILY WITH A LONG MILITARY HISTORY 
TWO SONS AND A DAD WHAT ABOUT YOUR GRANDDAD HE WAS IN THE ROYAL NAVY 
SECOND WORLD WAR 
SO THREE GENERATIONS OF YOUR FAMILY 
SERVED THIS COUNTRY 
YEAH 
DAVIE SPENT FIVE YEARS IN THE ARMY 
AS A TANK DRIVER AND A MACHINE GUNNER 
HE TELLS ME THAT STAYING IN PEAK CONDITION PROVED DIFFICULT 
COMING OUT THE TANKS WAS A BIT DAFT I WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH FITNESS 
AT THE TIME MY FITNESS WAS GETTING BAD YEAH 
YOU GOT UNFIT AND YOU HAD TROUBLE KEEPING UP WITH YOUR BFTS 
YOUR BATTLE FITNESS TESTS YEAH AND WHAT HAPPENED THEN 
YEAH THEN I CAME OUT DID YOU JUST DECIDE TO LEAVE 
YOU SAID I'M GOING TO LEAVE OR YEAH 
I GOT ON THE TRAIN BACK TO ME MUM'S 
SHE SAID WHAT ARE YOU DOING I SAID I'VE COME OUT THE ARMY 
SHE WENT MAD MY BROTHER WENT MAD HE'S IN THE ARTILLERY 
HOW DID YOU BECOME HOMELESS AND SLEEPING ROUGH 
I SORT OF GONE DOWN THE CROOKED PATH GOT IN TROUBLE GOT IN WITH THE WRONG CROWD 
ENDED UP IN TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS 
DAVIE LOST CONTACT WITH HIS PARENTS AND BROTHER AND IS COMPLETELY ON HIS OWN 
YEARS IN AND OUT OF HOSTELS BAD EXPERIENCES LEFT HIM UNABLE TO TRUST ANYONE 
A FEW WEEKS AGO THE FEW POSSESSIONS HE HAD WERE STOLEN 
IT'S HEARTBREAKING THAT A HIGHLY TRAINED TANK DRIVER 
CAN END UP HOMELESS FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS' 
I FEEL A BIT CHOKED UP TO BE HONEST I FEEL REALLY SORRY FOR HIM 
IT'S DESPERATE ISN'T IT DESPERATE 
I AM BEING NOW I'M BEING PATHETIC OH GOD 
I JUST WANT TO SCOOP HIM UP AND TAKE HIM HOME YOU KNOW 
REALLY 
IT'S DESPERATELY SAD 
IT'S JUST AWFUL AWFUL 
DAVIE HAS TOUCHED A NERVE 
I CAN'T MAKE EVERYTHING INSTANTLY ALL RIGHT BUT I CAN KEEP HIM COMPANY 
FOR A BIT 
I'LL BE O. K. HERE YEAH YEAH 
I WANT A SENSE OF WHAT DAVIE GOES THROUGH UNDER THE VIADUCT 
SURVIVING AND FENDING FOR HIMSELF 
IT'S QUITE NICE DOWN HERE 
IT'S BETTER THAN THE STRAND 
THIS IS ABOUT THE NICEST PLACE YOU'LL GET IN LONDON 
YEAH I GUESS SO 
I'VE SLEPT IN JUNGLES DESERTS ALL MANNER OF INHOSPITABLE PLACES THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE 
A WHOLE NEW SET OF SURVIVAL TECHNIQUES 
I DON'T KNOW HOW DAVIE GETS ANY REST HERE 
I'LL BE SURPRISED IF I SLEEP AT ALL 
THERE'S JUST SO MUCH NOISE AND 
NO I DON'T THINK I'LL SLEEP VERY MUCH TO BE HONEST 
APPARENTLY SOMETIMES GANGS COME ROUND AND STEAL WHAT YOU'VE GOT 
THAT'S WHY I'M LYING ON MY BOOTS 
YOU FEEL JUST TOTALLY ISOLATED 
VULNERABLE COLD 
DAVIE'S GETTING HIS HEAD DOWN NOW 
I WONDER WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT WHEN HE'S ASLEEP 
WHAT GOES THROUGH HIS MIND 
THE WATER TRUCK THE DISINFECTING TRUCK'S JUST COMING BY 
TO SPRAY US 
HE'S REVERSING NOW 
VERY NICE 
THE WASHING OF THE GREAT UNWASHED 
IT'S A SLEEPLESS NIGHT FOR ME DAVIE'S USED TO IT 
THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE'S COPING 
ONE THING THAT REALLY STRUCK ME LAST NIGHT 
IS THAT DAVIE HERE IS GOING DOWNHILL 
HE STARTED TO RAMBLE HE'S NOT COHERENT 
HAVING LIVED ROUGH FOR SO LONG HE'S ALMOST BEYOND REPAIR 
HE NEEDS HELP 
ALL RIGHT MATE KEEP SAFE YEAH 
I'LL BE IN TOUCH YEAH 
SPENDING TIME WITH DAVIE MAKES ME WONDER IS BEING HOMELESS IN ITSELF ENOUGH TO AFFECT HIS MENTAL STATE 
WHO BETTER TO SAY THAN JOHN BIRD FOUNDER OF THE BIG ISSUE 
THEY SAY THAT THREE MONTHS OF HOMELESSNESS 
TAKES THREE YEARS TO GET OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM 
BECAUSE YOU'LL START LOOKING NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING FOR THE NEXT DAY 
BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING FOR THE NEXT HOUR 
IT CREATES A KIND OF PSYCHOSIS THAT'S THE FORERUNNER OF DEPRESSION 
DEPRESSION IS THE KILLER OF PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO RECONNECT WITH SOCIETY 
DAVIE'S BEEN ON THE STREETS FOR THE BEST PART OF TWO DECADES 
ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF VETERANS END UP IN HIS EXTREME SITUATION 
MOST END UP HOMELESS YEARS AFTER LEAVING THE SERVICES WHEN PROBLEMS OVERWHELM THEM 
SO WHO ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE 
I CAN TALK ABOUT MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BECAUSE I WAS A YOUNG OFFENDER I WAS A BOY SOLDIER 
A MEMBER OF THE LONDON IRISH RIFLES A TERRITORIAL THING 
WHEN IT CAME TO LEAVING SCHOOL AND JOINING THE ARMY I WAS NOT ALLOWED 
THEY WEREN'T LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS THEY HAD TOO MANY PEOPLE 
I WANTED TO JOIN THE ARMY BECAUSE I WANTED SOMEBODY MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT MY LIFE 
OTHERWISE I WOULD GET INTO TROUBLE LO AND BEHOLD I GOT INTO TROUBLE 
YOU WILL FIND THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO GO INTO THE ARMY 
THEY WANT A VERY RIGID LIFESTYLE 
I WAS ONE WHO WANTED STRUCTURE AND DISCIPLINE AND BENEFITED FROM IT 
I GREW UP WITH DAD'S TALES OF HIS ARMY CAREER 
FROM THE DAY I JOINED I LOVED THE CAMARADERIE AND ADVENTURE 
AND WAS REALLY PROUD OF SERVING MY COUNTRY 
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I SAID TO MYSELF ENOUGH'S ENOUGH 
I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO LEAVE THE ARMY 
I'D BEEN IN THE ARMY SO LONG 
I KIND OF NEEDED TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE NOT TO WEAR THE UNIFORM 
TO BE OUT HERE JUST AS ME NOT AS MAJOR KEN ANY MORE JUST AS ME 
BUT IT WAS A DIFFICULT DECISION 
FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS THE ARMY HAD GIVEN ME EVERYTHING 
I WONDER WHETHER A RIGID LIFESTYLE THAT ATTRACTED PEOPLE LIKE ME 
IS THE VERY REASON SOME STRUGGLE WHEN THEY LEAVE 
GRAHAM APPLETON IS FIFTY TWO HOMELESS AND AN ALCOHOLIC 
FOR FOURTEEN YEARS HE WAS A HIGHLY TRAINED GUNNER ON A FRIGATE 
HE JOINED THE NAVY WHEN HE WAS SIXTEEN 
LIFE ON A WARSHIP WHAT WAS IT LIKE AS A COMMUNITY IT WAS BRILLIANT 
I LOVED IT BECAUSE I SAW THE WORLD AND GOT PAID FOR DOING IT 
I'VE DONE MORE THAN NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HAVE DONE 
AND GOT PAID FOR IT YEAH 
WERE YOU PROUD OF THIS ELITE TEAM 
I LOVED THE UNIFORM I LOVED WEARING THE UNIFORM 
IT GIVES YOU THAT BIT OF SELF WORTH YOU KNOW 
PRIDE YEAH A BIT OF PRIDE YOU HAD THIS WONDERFUL TIME YEAH 
THIS NEW FAMILY THE ROYAL NAVY TAUGHT YOU A LOT OF SKILLS 
THOSE LADS THAT TEAM THEY WERE YOUR FAMILY YEAH IN A WAY 
THE DAY YOU LEFT THE DAY YOU HANDED IN YOUR I. D. CARD 
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU FELT 
I I'M NOT BASICALLY SURE 
IT'S LIKE A SENSE OF LOSS WHAT AM I GOING TO DO NOW 
YOU WERE GUTTED YEAH GUTTED 
YOU'RE INSTITUTIONALISED RIGHT YOU DON'T WANT FOR NOTHING 
IF YOU WANT MONEY YOU WENT TO THE SUPPLY OFFICER AND SAID CASH ME A CHEQUE 
BUT IT'S HOW CAN I PUT IT IT'S 
WHETHER IT MAKES YOU WEAK WILLED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS DONE FOR YOU 
GRAHAM STRUGGLED WHEN HE LEFT THE NAVY 
HE WAS QUICKLY DRAWN BACK TO THE FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS OF HIS BASE IN PLYMOUTH 
I KEPT GOING FOR DRINKS DOWN UNION STREET 
SO IN A WAY YOU HADN'T REALLY LEFT NO 
DID YOU FEEL LIKE THAT SOMETIMES YEAH IT WAS JUST A VICIOUS CIRCLE 
THE ONLY PEOPLE YOU KNEW WELL I KNEW WERE SEAMEN 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
I NEVER MANAGED TO ADAPT TO CIVILIAN LIFE 
HIS INABILITY TO COPE WAS MADE WORSE BY HIS DRINKING 
THE STRAIN LED TO A SPLIT FROM HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN 
HE ENDED UP HOMELESS HERE IN LONDON 
WHEN YOU CAME DOWN TO LONDON YOU SLEPT ROUGH WHAT WAS IT LIKE IT WAS HARD 
HOW WERE YOU FEELING AFTER YOUR TIME IN THE NAVY PROUD BEING ON A SHIP 
A FIGHTING WAR MACHINE 
HOW DID YOU FEEL AS A PERSON BASICALLY LOST 
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN SUM IT UP YOU JUST FEEL LOST 
WHETHER IT'S A LACK OF SELF CONFIDENCE 
LOW SELF ESTEEM YOU JUST GET THIS QUESTION IN YOUR HEAD ALL THE TIME 
WHY ME WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE THIS 
WHEN I TALK TO GRAHAM HALF OF ME DOESN'T WANT TO FEEL SORRY FOR HIM 
AND HALF OF ME DOES 
BECAUSE I STILL WANT TO 
I'M STILL RESPECTING HIM AS A GUNNER ON THAT FRIGATE 
THAT'S HOW I SEE HIM IN MY MIND 
I DON'T SEE GRAHAM WITH A DRINK PROBLEM IN A HOSTEL 
HASN'T SEEN HIS KIDS FOR YEARS AND WHO HAS NO PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE 
BUT IT IS IT'S INCREDIBLY SAD 
IT'S INCREDIBLY SAD THAT SOMEONE LIKE HIM 
WHO WAS PART OF THIS WELL OILED MACHINE PROUD PRESSED HIS UNIFORM 
LOOKED AMAZING SERVED HIS QUEEN AND COUNTRY 
THE CONTRAST IS JUST ENORMOUS 
GRAHAM IS IN TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION 
HOSTELS HAVE DRAMATICALLY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF ROUGH SLEEPERS 
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS 
BUT LIKE MANY HOMELESS PEOPLE 
GRAHAM IS TRAPPED IN A CYCLE OF GOING FROM HOSTEL TO HOSTEL 
NEVER ABLE TO CONQUER HIS DRINKING 
REBUILDING HIS LIFE AS A CIVILIAN HAS PROVED EXTREMELY DIFFICULT 
I HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCES TO GRAHAM 
I JOINED WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN I KNEW NOTHING 
THE ARMY MADE ME 
GAVE ME TRAINING AND DISCIPLINE AND ALL THE THINGS THAT I NEEDED 
AND LIKE HIM I WAS EXTREMELY PROUD OF WHERE I WAS WHAT I DID 
LIKE HIM WHEN I LEFT AFTER THE INSTITUTIONALISATION AND BEING IN UNIFORM FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS 
THE SHOCK WAS ACUTE 
THAT MONEY'S NOT COMING INTO THE BANK LIKE IT USED TO BY MAGIC 
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE TO PROVIDE THAT ROOF OVER EVERYBODY'S HEAD 
IT WAS ONLY TILL I TOOK MY UNIFORM OFF AND STOOD OUT HERE 
THAT I REALISED IT WAS A HARSH ENVIRONMENT 
IT WASN'T GOING TO BE AS EASY AS I THOUGHT TO BE A CIVILIAN IT WAS GOING TO BE TOUGH 
IN RECENT YEARS THE RESETTLEMENT TRAINING 
PROVIDED BY THE ARMED SERVICES HAS GREATLY IMPROVED 
EVERYONE GETS ASSISTANCE IN RETURNING TO CIVILIAN LIFE REGARDLESS OF RANK 
NEVERTHELESS IN REALITY MAKING THAT TRANSITION IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT 
IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED THE STRESS OF COMBAT ADJUSTING TO CIVILIAN LIFE CAN BE EVEN HARDER 
I'VE COME NORTH 
I'VE BEEN TOLD ABOUT A GLASWEGIAN EX SOLDIER WHO JOINED THE ARMY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO THE YEAR BEFORE I DID 
HE NOW LIVES IN THIS HOMELESS HOSTEL 
PRETTY GRIM AUSTERE LOOKING BUILDING 
LIKE ME HE WAS A MEMBER OF AN ELITE TEAM 
HIS WAS THE PARACHUTE REGIMENT 
GOOD MORNING MORNING 
IT'S KEN HAMES HERE TO SEE GEORGE MILLER 
THE PARAS ARE HIGHLY REGARDED BECAUSE SELECTION IS NOTORIOUSLY TOUGH ONLY THE VERY BEST GET IN 
THEY'RE TRAINED FOR SOME OF THE HARDEST COMBAT MISSIONS 
THEIR MOTTO IS READY FOR ANYTHING 
HERE WE GO 
GEORGE MILLER'S FIFTY SIX 
HE SERVED WITH THE PARAS IN NORTHERN IRELAND AT THE HEIGHT OF THE TROUBLES IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
I WAS THERE THEN AS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD AFTER BASIC TRAINING 
I REMEMBER THE PARAS' AWESOME REPUTATION 
EXCUSE ME WHILE I HAVE A SMALL LIBATION I NEVER SAY DRINK 
I SAY LIBATION COS I'M A SOPHISTICATED EX PARATROOPER 
I KNOW WHAT LIBATION MEANS 
THE CHEAP CIDER HIS POSSESSIONS IN PLASTIC BAGS 
GEORGE HASN'T SEEN HIS WIFE OR CHILDREN IN TEN YEARS 
HE'S A LONG WAY FROM BEING A CRACK PARATROOPER 
WHEN YOU THINK OF ALL THAT TRAINING 
SPECIALISATION AND YOU KNOW THE INCREDIBLE CAMARADERIE 
OH AYE AND TEAMWORK THAT'S NEEDED 
TO MAKE UNITS LIKE THE PARACHUTE REGIMENT MARINES AND S. A. S. OPERATE 
IT TAKES INCREDIBLE DEDICATION 
IT TAKES COURAGE YOU'RE FORMED HOW CAN I EXPRESS THIS 
BY THE VERY NATURE OF THE UNIT 
IT SOUNDS LIKE AN AMERICANISATION I SUPPOSE 
BUT YOU DO BECOME A BAND OF BROTHERS 
THERE'S NO NEED TO SAY THAT'S MY STUFF THAT'S YOUR STUFF 
IF FOR INSTANCE YOU RUN OUT OF SMOKES OR SOMETHING 
ONE OF YOUR BUDDIES GIVE YOU A SMOKE 
IT'S AUTOMATIC YOU DO BECOME A BAND OF BROTHERS 
DO YOU THINK THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM 
WHEN YOUNG MEN LEAVE THE BAND OF BROTHERS YEAH 
I DON'T THINK THEY REALISE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE 
YOU ARRIVE IN CIVILIAN LIFE YOU LOSE A HELL OF A LOT 
YOU'VE NO GOT A BUDDY 
YOU CAN'NAE GET OUT YOUR KIT BAG OR YOUR SLEEPING BAG RATHER 
IN THE MORNING AND GO SHIT I DON'T HAVE ANY TOOTHPASTE OR SHAVING CREAM 
THEN SAY TO ONE OF THE BOYS GIVE US A SHOT OF YOUR TOOTHPASTE 
THAT'S NOT THERE ANYWHERE NO YOU KNOW 
YOU'RE YOU'RE ACTUALLY ABANDONED INTO CIVILIAN LIFE 
AND THE CIVILIANS THAT AREN'T EX FORCES DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND YOU 
HOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO SOMEONE 
YOUR FEELINGS THE FIRST TIME SOMEBODY SHOOTS AT YOU 
THEY'RE REAL BULLETS YOU KNOW THE OLD LEAD HORNETS 
IT'S NO SOLDIER FIRING BLANKS IT'S REAL BULLETS GOING 
RUSHES OVER YOUR HEAD IT'S A RATHER SOBERING EXPERIENCE YEAH 
WHAT SORT OF EFFECT DO YOU THINK 
BEING IN THAT SORT OF SITUATION HAD ON YOU MENTALLY 
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU OR SOME OF YOUR COLLEAGUES CAME AWAY 
FROM THOSE TIMES IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
WITH A FEW MENTAL SCARS TO OH AYE DEFINITELY MENTAL SCARS 
NEVER MIND CLINT EASTWOOD AND STEVE MCQUEEN 
TO SHOOT AND KILL SOMEONE IS A PRETTY DRAMATIC EXPERIENCE 
IT REPLAYS IN YOUR MIND YEAH 
IN THE WEE QUIET HOURS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE LYING IN YOUR BED 
IT GOES THROUGH YOUR MIND SHIT I SHOT AND KILLED THAT GUY 
AND MAYBE HE'D A WIFE AND KIDS 
PROBABLY DID 
YOU DON'T KNOW 
THAT SCARS THEM SCARRED ME 
IT DOES SCAR YOU IF IT DOESN'T THEN YOU'RE A PSYCHOPATH 
OR A SOCIOPATH OR WHATEVER KIND OF PATH NAME THEY WANT TO PUT ON IT 
YOU CANNOT SHOOT AND KILL SOMEONE 
AND WALK AWAY UNBLEMISHED 
THAT WAS QUITE A HARROWING EXPERIENCE TALKING TO GEORGE 
IT'S NEVER GOOD TO SEE A FELLOW HUMAN BEING IN CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THAT 
HE'S OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW DEPENDENT ON DRINK 
HE KNOWS THAT HIMSELF 
BUT I THOUGHT HE SPOKE A LOT OF TRUTHS 
MAYBE HE'S DRINKING TO BLOT OUT THE MEMORIES OF WHAT HE SAW AND DID IN THE ARMY 
IT MIGHT BE HIS WAY OF DEALING WITH POST TRAUMATIC STRESS 
NO MATTER HOW STRONG HIS BAND OF BROTHERS 
NOTHING PREVENTED HIM FROM BEING SCARRED 
I KNOW HOW THAT FEELS 
I WAS A TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD LIEUTENANT DURING THE FALKLANDS WAR 
I WAS PHYSICALLY UNSCATHED BUT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH POST TRAUMATIC STRESS 
AFTER AN ANXIETY ATTACK A FEW WEEKS AFTER RETURNING HOME 
I WAS RUNNING DOWN THE ROAD AND I JUST COLLAPSED IN A HEAP 
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME I'M A FIT GUY WITH THE ROYAL MARINES 
I WAS A LEADER OF COMBAT TROOPS 
ALL OF A SUDDEN TO FIND YOURSELF SCARED ANXIOUS 
YOU'RE SWEATING I THOUGHT MY HEART WOULD PACK UP EVERY FIVE MINUTES 
I THEN STARTED TO GET BAD DREAMS THOSE DREAMS STILL OCCUR 
IN THE DREAMS I'M BEING CHASED WITH SOLDIERS 
WE CAN'T GET OUT WE'RE TRAPPED 
THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO 
PEOPLE DIE GET KILLED 
OH I WOULDN'T WISH IT ON ANYBODY I KNOW HOW AWFUL IT HAS BEEN FOR ME 
SOME PEOPLE HAVE GOT IT FAR WORSE 
AND THEY'LL NEVER EVER RECOVER FROM IT 
IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE LODGED IN THEIR BRAIN AND WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO TRIGGER IT OFF 
I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT TRIGGERED THE MENTAL STRESS I LIVE WITH 
I SUSPECT ITS ROOTS ARE BEFORE THE FALKLANDS MY CHILDHOOD 
AND MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY FATHER 
MY DAD WAS TOUGH REALLY TOUGH 
HE WAS PARTICULARLY HARD ON ME 
HE WOULDN'T THINK TWICE ABOUT GIVING ME A CLOUT ROUND THE HEAD 
KNOCKING ME ACROSS THE ROOM 
I LIVED IN FEAR OF HIM FOR A LOT OF MY FORMATIVE YEARS 
IT WAS A KIND OF RELIEF WHEN I LEFT HOME AND WENT TO THE ARMY 
BECAUSE HE WAS QUITE A FIERCE CHARACTER 
A LOT OF BULLET HOLES IN HIM 
AND A MAN WHO'D SEEN A LOT OF WAR 
HE HAD A LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE OLD WHISKY BOTTLE A BIT 
I SOMETIMES THINK HE DRANK TO FORGET 
SOME OF THE HORRIBLE THINGS HE'D SEEN 
IT ONLY OCCURRED TO ME RECENTLY THAT MAYBE HIS POST TRAUMATIC STRESS 
HIS COMBAT STRESS HIS SHELL SHOCK WAS THERE INSIDE HIM 
AND IT WASN'T CATALYZED TILL MUCH LATER IN HIS LIFE 
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO FORGIVE MY FATHER FOR WHAT HE DID TO ME 
PARTLY BECAUSE I NOW UNDERSTAND THE KIND OF TRAUMA HE STRUGGLED WITH 
I KNOW THAT WEARING A UNIFORM 
DOESN'T PREVENT YOU BEING VULNERABLE 
THANKFULLY IN LONDON ONE CHARITY HELPS EX SERVICEPEOPLE 
BY TACKLING PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS 
THE PROJECT WAS SET UP TEN YEARS AGO WHEN THE SCALE OF THE HOMELESS VETERAN PROBLEM WAS REALISED 
MOST OF THE PEOPLE WE SEE WILL HAVE HAD DYSFUNCTIONAL BACKGROUNDS 
BEFORE THEY COME INTO THE MILITARY 
IT TENDS TO MEAN THAT PEOPLE 
WHO COME IN WITH SERIOUS PROBLEMS 
MAY BE CONTAINED VERY WELL AND FUNCTION O. K. WHILE THERE 
BUT WHEN THEY COME OUT THE OTHER END 
ARE IN A SIMILAR EMOTIONAL PLACE TO WHERE THEY WERE WHEN THEY WENT IN 
I WAS CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED WITH P. T. S. D. 
BUT I. I DON'T THINK THAT MY EXPERIENCES IN THE FALKLANDS 
I DON'T THINK THAT WAS THE REAL DRIVER OF MY KIND OF STRESS 
I THINK IT GOES MUCH FURTHER BACK TO A DYSFUNCTIONAL HOUSEHOLD 
WHERE I USED TO HIDE FOR FEAR OF MY FATHER 
WHO WOULD COME HOME FULL OF WHISKY AND BE AGGRESSIVE 
AND HIT ME AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I LEFT 
IT MAY SOUND A BIT BONKERS TO SAY THIS YOU MAY NOT WANT IT ON FILM 
BUT ISN'T IT INTERESTING THAT SOMEBODY 
WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF AN AGGRESSIVE FATHER GOES INTO THE FORCES 
WHERE AN AGGRESSIVE SERGEANT MAJOR IS STANDARD 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN YES 
YOU GO INTO AN INSTITUTION WHERE THE PATERNAL FUNCTION 
WHETHER THAT'S THE ARMY THE REGIMENT THE OFFICERS 
NCOS WHATEVER IT IS 
IS THIS VERY STRONG DOMINANT AUTHORITATIVE PATERNAL FUNCTION 
A DISCIPLINE FIGURE YES 
THIS IS A MAJOR FACTOR 
WITH ALL THE PEOPLE WE'LL BE GETTING COMING INTO OUR SERVICE 
DESPITE WHATEVER EXPERIENCES THEY'VE HAD IN THE MILITARY 
THE EXPERIENCE IN CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE WILL PROBABLY BE MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT 
WILL EXPLAIN SOME OF THE REASONS FOR GOING INTO THE MILITARY 
BUT WILL ALSO TELL US A LOT ABOUT WHY THINGS WENT A BIT WRONG 
IN THE MILITARY OR AFTERWARDS AND THEY ENDED UP HOMELESS 
THE KEY TO AVOIDING THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL IS FACING YOUR DEMONS NO MATTER WHERE THEY CAME FROM 
THAT'S NOT EASY AS I'VE DISCOVERED 
I'VE HEARD THAT THERE IS A HOMELESS EX SOLDIER IN THE SOUTHWEST WHO FACED HIS PROBLEMS SUCCESSFULLY 
I WANT TO FIND OUT HOW HE DID IT 
IN CORNWALL THE BRITISH LEGION DEALS WITH HOMELESS VETERANS AT A RATE OF ONE A DAY 
SIXTY TWO YEAR OLD DAVE MACLAMONT IS A FELLOW EX ROYAL MARINE COMMANDO 
HE SERVED FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS AND WE BOTH FOUGHT IN THE FALKLANDS 
FOR EIGHT YEARS HE'S LED A NOMADIC LIFE 
LIVING ROUGH AND TRAVELLING AROUND BRITAIN ON HIS HORSE 
HE STOPS TO BORROW THE CORNER OF A FIELD OR A DISUSED CARAVAN 
ONE OF THE VERY FEW WHO CHOOSE TO BE HOMELESS' 
DID YOU AT ANY TIME 
AFTER YOU LEFT THE ROYAL MARINES RECOGNISE THAT YOU WERE HOMELESS 
YEAH 
YOU STILL ARE IN A WAY OH YEAH I RECOGNISED THAT 
BUT I'M WARM I'M DRY 
I'VE GOT FOOD RIGHT 
I'VE GOT AN AMAZING OLD HORSE 
I CAN GET FROM A TO B. I DON'T NEED MUCH MORE 
I UNDERSTAND WHY DAVE GRAVITATED BACK TO CORNWALL 
A FEW MILES FROM HIS BORROWED CARAVAN ARE THE CLIFFS WE TRAINED ON 
AS COMMANDOS PREPARING FOR THE FALKLANDS WAR 
I REMEMBER 
YOU COULDN'T COME IN WHEN IT WAS AS ROUGH NO YOU'D NEVER GET ON SHORE 
WHEN IT WAS NOT SO ROUGH WE USED TO LAND ON THE ROCKS AT THE BOTTOM 
YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFICULT LITTLE MOVE AROUND THE OVERHANG 
WHEN YOU DID THE NIGHT CLIMB THE MOON WAS THAT SIDE YEAH 
YOU COULDN'T SEE BUGGER ALL 
BLACK AS SPADES IT WAS HELPFUL 
THAT WAS ON PURPOSE IT WAS A FULL MOON BUT YOU COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING 
DAVE SEEMS QUITE HAPPY WITH LIFE 
YET LIKE ME HE SUFFERED POST TRAUMATIC STRESS WHEN HE CAME BACK FROM THE FALKLANDS 
UNLIKE ME HE SEEMS TO HAVE FOUND A WAY OF DEALING WITH IT 
I'VE NEVER KNOWN WHAT TRIGGERED MY FIRST ANXIETY ATTACK AND RECURRING NIGHTMARES 
DAVE KNOWS THE SPECIFIC MOMENT THAT SET OFF HIS OWN STRESS 
COINCIDENTALLY WE WERE ADVANCING A FEW MILES APART 
AND HE HAD TO CROSS A BRIDGE WIRED WITH EXPLOSIVES' 
EVERY TIME I PUT MY FOOT DOWN I WAS SAYING TO MYSELF BANG BANG 
AND IT DIDN'T YOU THINK THAT WAS THE TRIGGER 
THAT WAS THE P. T. S. D. TRIGGER 
YEAH I KNOW IT WAS 
DO YOU KNOW I HAVE TO I'M SORRY TO KEEP INTERRUPTING YOUR STORY 
I WONDER NOW THIS IS A REVELATION FOR ME TALKING TO YOU 
BECAUSE MEANWHILE WE WERE STUCK WITH TWO COMPANY FROM THE WELSH GUARDS IN A MINEFIELD 
WE GOT STUCK IN A MINEFIELD OH GOD 
TWO OF OUR LADS ONE OFFICER AND ONE MARINE GOT BLOWN UP YEAH 
AND UM 
THAT'S THAT'S WEIRD 
I'VE NEVER LOOKED ON THAT AWFUL NIGHT IN THAT MINEFIELD 
I'VE NEVER LOOKED ON THAT AS A POSSIBLE TRIGGER 
THERE ARE PROBABLY NUMEROUS OTHER 
LITTLE THINGS IN YOUR MILITARY CAREER 
SOME OF WHICH ARE INSIGNIFICANT OR MY CHILDHOOD I GUESS 
OR YOUR CHILDHOOD IT COULD START THERE 
ANYWHERE DOWN THE LINE BUT IT NEEDS ONE TRIGGER 
FOR DAVE RECOGNISING THAT THE MOMENT ON THE BRIDGE 
TRIGGERED HIS POST TRAUMATIC STRESS LET HIM START TO DEAL WITH IT 
THE FACT THAT I CAN NOW LOOK AT ALL THAT 
AS IF I WAS LOOKING AT A FILM 
WITH NO EMOTION WHATSOEVER 
MEANS THAT THE P. T. S. D. THAT WAS TRIGGERED ISN'T THERE ANY MORE 
I CAN LOOK AT EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED LIKE A B. MOVIE 
I CAN'T LOOK AT IT LIKE THAT LIKE A B. MOVIE LIKE YOU CAN NO 
BECAUSE I DON'T PERHAPS I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT 
LIKE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND YOURS YET 
MAYBE ONE DAY I WILL 
WHEN I LOOK BACK TO THAT NIGHT STUCK IN A MINEFIELD 
AND YOU WERE HOPPING AROUND ON ONE 
IT STILL FILLS ME FULL OF DREAD 
THERE ARE TWO THINGS YOU'VE GOT TO DO 
YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THE SITUATION IN WHICH YOU FIND YOURSELF 
HAVING DONE THAT 
YOU THEN HAVE TO DECIDE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
I SAY MY JOURNEY HASN'T FINISHED YET WITH COPING WITH THIS 
I HAVE TO FACE MY FEAR 
YEAH I HAVE TO DO IT AS I'M DOING NOW TALKING TO YOU 
IT'S STILL THERE INSIDE ME I DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER IT 
I CAN'T SUBDUE IT TO THE EXTENT WHERE THAT'S TOMORROW'S PROBLEM 
RIGHT I I HAVE TO CONFRONT IT 
I'M LOOKING FOR THE ANSWER WHICH YOU'VE CLEARLY FOUND 
I HAVEN'T QUITE YET NO BUT IT'S THERE 
IT'S GETTING THERE IT'S HONESTY ISN'T IT 
YES 
I'M KIND OF OPENING MY HEART AND SAYING I'M FACING THE PROBLEM 
AS OPPOSED TO EXACTLY 
AND UNTIL YOU TOTALLY ACCEPT THE SITUATION WHICH YOU'RE IN 
WHICH IS NOT OF YOUR MAKING WHICH IS P. T. S. D. YOU'RE GOING NOWHERE 
I KNOW THAT THERE'S A THIN LINE BETWEEN COPING WITH MENTAL PRESSURE 
AND NOT 
I STILL HAVEN'T CONQUERED ALL MY DEMONS 
THANKFULLY THAT HASN'T LED ME TO BECOME HOMELESS OR TURN TO DRINK 
BUT I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT LIFE CAN BE WHEN YOUR MIND'S IN TURMOIL 
IT'S BEEN THREE WEEKS SINCE I MET THE TANK DRIVER SLEEPING ROUGH UNDER HOLBORN VIADUCT 
THERE'S NO SIGN OF DAVIE TODAY 
A COUPLE OF POLICEMEN HAVE JUST TOLD ME THAT APART FROM BEING MOVED ON 
HE'S ALSO BEEN SECTIONED UNDER THE MENTAL HEALTH ACT 
IT PROVES THAT LIVING ROUGH ALCOHOL POOR DIET ALL CAUGHT UP WITH HIM 
I JUST HOPE THAT HE CAN NOW GET THE HELP HE NEEDS AND DESERVES 
IT'S SAD THAT BEING SECTIONED MIGHT BE THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO A SOLDIER SINCE HE LEFT THE ARMY 
I STARTED TRYING TO FIND OUT WHY SOME OF OUR EX SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN 
WERE LIVING ROUGH OR HOMELESS 
I'VE DISCOVERED THAT IT'S AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX SUBJECT 
MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS 
THAT STARTED EARLY IN LIFE CAN AFFECT ALL HOMELESS PEOPLE 
FOR SOME VETERANS THAT MAY JUST BE THE BEGINNING 
ADJUSTING TO A COMPLETELY NEW WAY OF LIFE WITHOUT THE BAND OF BROTHERS 
WILL ALSO TAKE ITS TOLL 
THEY MAY HAVE TO STRUGGLE WITH MENTAL STRESS 
BROUGHT ON BY THE TRAUMA OF WHAT THEY'VE SEEN AND DONE 
I'VE REALISED THAT I'VE BATTLED THESE PROBLEMS TOO 
BUT I'VE BEEN LUCKY THOUSANDS HAVEN'T 
PLENTY MORE WILL FACE THESE DIFFICULTIES HAVING EXPERIENCED IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN 
WHEN THE NEXT GENERATION LOSE THEIR BAND OF BROTHERS 
THEY MAY NEED ALL THE HELP THEY CAN GET IF THEY AREN'T TO JOIN BRITAIN'S HOMELESS ARMY 
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE IS STOLEN 
APART FROM ME 
I'M THE BEST SAFE CRACKER THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER PRODUCED 
I AM WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE BOBBY MOORE AND THE BEATLES 
AND ONCE BLOOD RAN THROUGH MY VEINS 
NOW COME ON LET'S DO IT 
THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS ARE OUT OF RETIREMENT 
ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS JOB OR WHAT THAT'S MORE LIKE IT I'LL KILL YOU 
THE MAURICE I KNOW CATCH THEM IF YOU CAN
