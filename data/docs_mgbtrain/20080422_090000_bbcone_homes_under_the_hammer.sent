HOW MUCH COULD IT BE WORTH IF THOSE ISSUES WERE RESOLVED 
HELLO NOW WHETHER YOU'RE BUYING PROPERTY AS AN INVESTMENT 
OR AS A HOME YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'VE BOUGHT WISELY 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIND BUT WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS VALUE FOR MONEY 
ONE PLACE YOU CAN FIND THAT IS AT THE PROPERTY AUCTIONS 
FROM SPRAWLING MANSIONS TO ONE BEDROOM FLATS THERE ARE ALL SORTS AT A PROPERTY AUCTION 
SO HERE ARE THE LOTS THAT MADE OUR BUYERS PUT THEIR HANDS IN THEIR POCKETS ON TODAY'S PROGRAMME 
COULD THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS HASLEMERE HOUSE BE ITS DOWNFALL 
ALTHOUGH THIS WOOD LOOKS VERY PRETTY IT COULD BE A PROBLEM IF YOU NEED A LOAN TO PURCHASE THE PLACE 
THE MEMORIES COME FLOODING BACK IN THIS FORMER SCHOOL NEAR NOTTINGHAM 
THE MOMENT YOU WALK THROUGH THE DOOR YOU ARE STEPPING BACK TO YOUR SCHOOLDAYS 
THIS INDUSTRIAL UNIT IN ROCHESTER KENT MIGHT NOT BE TO EVERYONE'S TASTE 
BUT WHAT YOU ARE BUYING HERE IS THE SPACE 
AND THERE IS LOTS OF IT 
ALL OF THESE PROPERTIES WENT TO AUCTION WE'LL FIND OUT WHO BOUGHT THEM AND WHAT THEY PAID 
WHEN THEY WENT UNDER THE HAMMER 
SOLD 
I'M IN HASLEMERE ONCE DESCRIBED AS THE FASHIONABLE CAPITAL OF THE BEAUTIFUL SURREY HIGHLANDS 
WHILST NOT THE REMOTE COUNTRY TOWN IT ONCE WAS 
THE VILLAGES IN THE HILLS AROUND HASLEMERE STILL HAVE AN AWAY FROM IT ALL FEEL 
AND THE TOWN ITSELF IS THE GATEWAY TO THESE FANTASTIC BEAUTY SPOTS 
ALL OF THOSE FACTORS MEAN THAT PROPERTIES HERE ARE IN DEMAND 
IN EVERY AUCTION THERE'S ALWAYS A LITTLE GEM LURKING AND I THINK I'VE FOUND IT TODAY 
ON OFFER IS A UNIQUE THREE BEDROOM DETACHED PERIOD PROPERTY WITH CHARACTER 
AND THE PICTURE IN THIS CATALOGUE LOOKS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 
NOW IT'S BEEN RECENTLY REFURBISHED AND IT'S IN A WONDERFUL LOCATION VERY NEAR TO THE STATION 
THE CATALOGUE ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THERE'S POTENTIAL TO REDEVELOP 
IT ALMOST SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE 
AND LOOK YOU EVEN GET YOUR OWN FOOTBRIDGE TO THE FRONT DOOR 
HOW COOL IS THAT THIS INTERESTING HOUSE WENT TO AUCTION WITH A GUIDE PRICE OF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND 
WHAT A STRANGE EXTERIOR MOCK TUDOR MEETS TREEHOUSE WITH ITS OWN GANGPLANK 
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE INSIDE 
THIS IS CALLED THE OLD WEAVING HOUSE AND IT DATES BACK TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT 
WHERE DURING THE ARTS AND CRAFTS MOVEMENT 
A WEAVING WORKSHOP WAS SET UP FOR LOCALS TO WEAVE FABRICS TO MAKE CLOTHES 
WELL AS YOU CAN SEE I'VE WALKED STRAIGHT INTO THE UPSTAIRS PART OF THE HOUSE 
YOU CAN SEE OVER HERE THIS HUGE WINDOW IT'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AND IT'S LETTING LOADS OF LIGHT IN 
WHICH MAKES ME THINK THAT THIS IS THE SPACE WHERE THE WEAVERS MIGHT HAVE WORKED YEARS AGO 
BUT JUST TAKE A LOOK AND SEE HOW MODERN IT IS TODAY 
YOU'VE GOT CREAM PAINT EVERYWHERE NEW CARPETS EN SUITE BATHROOMS 
THIS IS THE MIDDLE ROOM THERE ARE TWO OTHER BEDROOMS EITHER SIDE 
AND YOU'VE GOT A LONG AIRY CORRIDOR BETWEEN THEM 
I CAN'T WAIT TO HAVE A NOSE AROUND DOWNSTAIRS 
THE WEAVING HOUSE IS BUILT ON THREE LEVELS IN A KIND OF HOLLOW 
FROM THE STREET YOU GO ACROSS THE FOOTPATH TO THE TOP OF THE HOUSE 
WHICH IS WHERE THE THREE BEDROOMS ARE 
THEY ALL HAVE INDIVIDUAL EN SUITES BUT THERE'S NO SEPARATE FAMILY BATHROOM 
WITH SO MANY WINDOWS IT'S A LOVELY LIGHT SPACE 
WHAT'S THE LAYOUT DOWNSTAIRS 
NOW THIS IS A HUGE SPACE 
THIS ROOM ALONE HAS GOT TWELVE INDIVIDUAL WINDOWS 
BUT I'M LOOKING STRAIGHT OUT ONTO A CAR PARK WHICH I'VE GOT TO SAY IS QUITE DISAPPOINTING FOR ME 
NOW THROUGH HERE OH WE'VE GOT A KITCHEN WHICH I REALLY LIKE 
IT'S GOT THAT SORT OF VERY FASHIONABLE PAINTED WOOD LOOK 
I LIKE THE COLOUR BUT MAYBE IT'S NOT TO EVERYBODY'S TASTES 
NOW THROUGH THERE THERE'S A UTILITY ROOM WHICH I THINK IS A REAL BONUS FOR FAMILIES 
YOU CAN STORE AWAY ALL THAT WASHING AND IRONING 
BUT I HAVE NOTICED THERE IS NO SEPARATE TOILET IN THE WHOLE HOUSE 
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A BEDROOM TO GET TO ONE WHICH ISN'T IDEAL 
I GUESS IT'S JUST ANOTHER QUIRKY FEATURE WHICH ADDS TO THE ECCENTRIC NATURE OF THE PLACE 
WE'VE SEEN THE TOP TWO FLOORS AND THERE'S MORE SPACE TO CONJURE WITH AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOUSE 
BUT IS IT INSIDE OR OUTSIDE 
SO HERE WE ARE OUTSIDE 
YOU HAVE TO ACCESS THIS VIA A SHARED DRIVEWAY NEXT DOOR 
BUT UNDERNEATH THIS HOUSE WE'VE GOT THIS HUGE GARAGE 
YOU'VE ALSO GOT A STORAGE AREA JUST HERE 
BUT THERE IS NO GARDEN AT ALL JUST THIS AND THAT'S A DOWNSIDE FOR SUCH A BIG HOUSE 
THE OTHER THING TO NOTE IS THE TIMBER FRAME CONSTRUCTION 
NOW THIS CAN BE A STICKING POINT FOR MORTGAGE COMPANIES 
AND ALTHOUGH THIS WOOD LOOKS VERY PRETTY 
IT COULD BE A PROBLEM IF YOU NEED A LOAN TO PURCHASE THE PLACE 
I BETTER KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK ON WOOD 
THAT MIGHT BE WHAT PUTS OFF SOME BUYERS 
THE LACK OF GARDEN IS A DRAWBACK AND IT'S NOT IDEAL TO OVERLOOK A CAR PARK OH AND THERE'S ANOTHER THING 
BEYOND THAT CAR PARK THERE'S A BUSY RAILWAY LINE 
SO WHO DOES THE LOCAL PROPERTY EXPERT SEE THIS UNUSUAL HASLEMERE HOUSE APPEALING TO 
THIS PARTICULAR STREET ATTRACTS A LOT OF FIRST TIME BUYERS 
AND COMMUTERS BECAUSE OF ITS CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE MAINLINE STATION 
THE PROPERTY ITSELF WILL PROBABLY ATTRACT A LOT OF INTEREST 
BUT I THINK THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE MAY BE PUT OFF 
BECAUSE OF ITS TIMBER FRAME CONSTRUCTION 
IT ALSO HAS THE RAILWAY LINE BEHIND IT AND PARKING IS VERY POOR IN THE AREA 
IT WOULD BE USEFUL IF IT HAD A SEPARATE CLOAKROOM 
SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO ACCESS A CLOAKROOM THROUGH A BATHROOM 
HOW MUCH COULD IT BE WORTH IF THOSE ISSUES WERE RESOLVED 
I WOULD SUGGEST IF THE IMPROVEMENTS WERE DONE TO THE PROPERTY THAT WE MIGHT BE LOOKING 
TO ACHIEVE A GUIDE PRICE OF SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED THIRTY AND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
THE GUIDE PRICE WAS SIXTY THOUSAND BELOW THAT WHEN THE WEAVING HOUSE WENT TO AUCTION 
SO THERE COULD BE A RETURN HERE FOR SOMEONE 
WHAT A SHAME THAT THE HOUSE HAS SO MUCH SPACE ON THE GROUND FLOOR 
BUT YOU CAN'T ACCESS IT FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE 
THAT COULD BE THE CHALLENGE TO TACKLE HERE 
THIS IS A STUNNING PROPERTY AND GREAT VALUE WITH A TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND GUIDE PRICE 
IT'S IN GREAT CONDITION AND SO NEAR TO THE RAILWAY STATION 
HOWEVER IT'S THE SORT OF PLACE SOMEONE WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH 
LET'S SEE WHO FELL FOR IT WHEN IT WENT TO AUCTION 
RIGHT MOVING ON NOW TO LOT EIGHTY SIX WHICH IS THE WEAVING HOUSE 
WITH DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL OFFERING IT WITH VACANT POSSESSION 
WHO'D LIKE TO GIVE ME A START ON THIS 
SOMEBODY WANT TO START ME AT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
BIDDING HOW MUCH TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THANK YOU 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THANK YOU TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE 
TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY 
TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN 
TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE 
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND 
ONE MORE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE 
LOSE IT FOR ONE THOUSAND 
YES NO IF NOT IT GOES TO THE GENTLEMAN THERE 
IT'S TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND IT'S AGAINST YOU AND AGAINST YOU 
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FOR THE FIRST 
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FOR THE SECOND 
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FOR THE THIRD AND FINAL TIME ARE WE ALL DONE 
SOLD TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SIR WELL BOUGHT 
THE FINAL BID OF TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND WAS MADE BY ANDY AND HIS WIFE SARAH 
THEY WERE DRAWN TO THE PROPERTY AS THEY BOTH WORKED 
IN WEAVING AND TEXTILE DESIGN WHICH IS HOW THEY MET 
THEY BOUGHT THE HOUSE TO LIVE IN WITH THEIR TWO CHILDREN 
SO I MET UP WITH ANDY BACK AT THE WEAVING HOUSE TO LEARN HOW 
IT WILL BE WOVEN INTO THE TAPESTRY OF THEIR LIVES 
ANDY CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU YOU MUST BE ABSOLUTELY THRILLED 
YEAH THIS REALLY WAS THE JEWEL ON AUCTION DAY I THINK IT WAS YEAH IT CERTAINLY WAS FOR US ANYWAY 
SO WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU LOVED ABOUT THIS PROPERTY 
WELL WE'VE GOT A BACKGROUND OF WEAVING 
I WAS A WEAVER AND MY WIFE IS A WEAVER AND THIS IS CALLED THE WEAVING HOUSE 
SO WE JUST WANTED TO COME AND HAVE A LOOK 
BECAUSE WEAVING HOUSES BUILT AROUND THIS TIME HAVE HUGE WINDOWS 
SO THE WEAVERS CAN SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
SO DID YOU JUST COME AND HAVE A LOOK TO BE NOSY OR BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT YOU MIGHT PURCHASE 
MOSTLY TO BE NOSY BUT THEN WE WALKED IN 
AND WE KIND OF GLANCED AT EACH OTHER AND THOUGHT YOU KNOW WE COULD LIVE HERE 
IT'S WEIRD WALKING IN BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST LIKE A NEW PROPERTY 
HMM IT'S BEEN PAINTED IT'S BEEN DECORATED THERE ARE MODERN SPOTLIGHTS EVERYWHERE 
YEAH ARE YOU GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO CHANGE THE CHARACTER INTERNALLY 
ONE THING WE'VE THOUGHT ABOUT WAS PUTTING A BALCONY OUTSIDE 
SO YOU CAN MAYBE PUT DOORS INTO THE WALL HERE 
AND THEN A BALCONY AT THIS LEVEL IT MIGHT PUT A BIT OF CHARACTER IN 
WHAT ABOUT THE TOILET SITUATION YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF LOOS UPSTAIRS BUT NO SINGLE TOILET 
THAT'S RIGHT FOR YOUR GUESTS THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH A BEDROOM 
THE SPARE BEDROOM AT THE END WE'LL PROBABLY MAKE A. 
WE'LL HAVE A BED THAT CAN BE MADE INTO A DOUBLE AND WE'LL HAVE A TABLE FOR AN OFFICE 
AND JUST HAVE THAT AS THE SORT OF THE TOILET THAT PEOPLE CAN USE 
WELL ANDY'S GOT A PLAN TO SORT OUT THE BATHROOM PROBLEM 
BUT SELLING THEIR CURRENT HOME ISN'T PROVING SO EASY 
FORTUNATELY HIS DAD HAS HELPED WITH THE FINANCES SO THEY CAN BUY THE WEAVING HOUSE 
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY HAVE BEEN PUT OFF BECAUSE OF THE WOODEN STRUCTURE 
BECAUSE IT'S VERY HARD TO GET A MORTGAGE THAT'S RIGHT 
WE'RE TRYING NOT TO THINK ABOUT THAT WE'RE BEING POSITIVE 
WE ARE BUT I JUST HAVE TO TAKE YOUR ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU SEE OUT THE WINDOW A BIG CAR PARK 
YEAH NOW HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT 
WE DREW UP A LIST OF DOWNSIDES AND UPSIDES TO THIS PLACE 
THERE'S THE CAR PARK THERE'S A RAILWAY LINE QUITE NEARBY 
THE PARKING OUTSIDE ISN'T FANTASTIC BUT WE JUST PUT UP WITH THOSE BECAUSE OF THE UPSIDES 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO DO WITH THIS ROOM 
CURTAINS UP OR NETS UP 
TO SHIELD THE CAR PARK OR WILL YOU JUST HAVE IT THERE 
NO WE'RE GOING TO PUT CURTAINS UP WE'LL HAVE SOME CURTAINS WOVEN TO SARAH'S ONE OF SARAH'S DESIGNS 
WILL SARAH BE ACTUALLY DOING ANY WEAVING FROM HERE HERSELF 
NOT IN THE BUILDING BUT WE MAY WELL PUT A LARGE SORT OF CHALET 
KIND OF SHED WORKSHOP OUTSIDE BECAUSE SARAH'S LOOM IS VERY 
IT'S QUITE BIG AND IT'S VERY VERY TALL 
ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE OUTSIDE YOU HAVE A GRAVELLY GARDEN AREA 
YEAH WITH A COUPLE OF EMPTY ROOMS UNDERNEATH RIGHT ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT 
A LOT OF IT WILL BE STORAGE WHICH IS VERY UNINSPIRING 
BUT WITH TWO BOYS IT'S CRYING OUT FOR A BIG TRAIN SET IN THERE OR 
YES SOMETHING LIKE THAT I CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK AND SEE YOU 
I KNOW YOU KNOW A LOT OF HISTORY ABOUT THIS PROPERTY 
AND YOU'VE BROUGHT SOME CUTTINGS WE HAVE YES SHALL WE GO AND HAVE A LOOK YEAH 
WEAVER OF LIFE 
LET ME LOOK AND SEE 
THE PATTERN OF MY LIFE GONE BY 
SHOWN ON YOUR TAPESTRY 
ANDY I'M SO EXCITED TO FIND OUT ALL THE HISTORY THAT TOOK PLACE IN THIS HOUSE 
O. K. LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THESE YEAH 
SO THE PICTURE HERE 
THIS IS THE UPSTAIRS BUT BEFORE IT WAS SEPARATED INTO THREE BEDROOMS 
WHICH PART OF THE HOUSE WAS THIS PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN IN 
THIS IS MORE OR LESS THIS ROOM 
THE WHOLE OF THE TOP FLOOR WAS PUT OUT TO WEAVING 
SO THERE ARE TEN LOOMS THAT WE CAN SEE HERE 
THIS WINDOW THAT WE CAN SEE HERE IS THE ONE THERE 
AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE LINE OF THE WOODWORK ALONG THE TOP YES 
SO OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE NO PARTITIONS IN THIS TOP FLOOR NO IT WAS JUST ONE BIG ROOM RIGHT 
IT'S BEEN TURNED INTO LIVING SPACE AFTERWARDS BUT THIS IS WHAT IT WAS ORIGINALLY 
THIS IS WHAT THE HOUSE ORIGINALLY LOOKED LIKE THAT'S RIGHT 
SO THIS IS THE HOUSE FROM THE OUTSIDE YOU CAN SEE THE SORT OF LITTLE ENTRANCE GATE 
AND THAT'S STILL THE ORIGINAL GATE AND YOU CAN SEE ALL THE WINDOWS ARE THE SAME 
AMAZING IT LOOKS LIKE THE ONLY THINGS THAT HAVE CHANGED ARE THE HEDGE AND THE TREES 
ANDY I CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK AND SEE HOW YOU'VE TURNED THIS WEAVING HOUSE INTO A HOME 
IT'S BEEN LOVELY MEETING YOU THANK YOU 
THIS IS A PURCHASE FROM THE HEART AND THERE'S NOTHING NICER 
THAN MEETING SOMEONE PASSIONATE ABOUT A NEW HOME 
THERE'S STILL HURDLES AHEAD FOR ANDY HERE'S HOPING THOUGH HE GETS HIS FINANCES IN ORDER 
AND MOVES THE FAMILY IN WITH NO HITCHES 
FIND OUT HOW HE GETS ON LATER IN THE PROGRAMME 
I'VE COME TO HUCKNALL 
IT'S AN EX MINING TOWN SEVEN MILES OUTSIDE NOTTINGHAM 
AND FAMOUS AS THE BURIAL PLACE OF ROMANTIC POET LORD BYRON 
IT'S CLOSE TO THE M. ONE HAS A MAINLINE TRAIN LINK AND THERE'S AN EXPRESS TRAM SYSTEM THAT CONNECTS HUCKNALL 
TO NOTTINGHAM SO IT'S POPULAR WITH COMMUTERS AND IT'S A LOT CHEAPER TO BUY HERE THAN IN THE CITY CENTRE 
THIS IS SPRING STREET SCHOOL IT WAS BUILT IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE AND CLOSED IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX 
WHEN IT WAS AMALGAMATED WITH ANOTHER LOCAL SCHOOL 
SO HOW MUCH DO YOU RECKON FOR THE OLD SCHOOL BUILDINGS 
LOTS OF OTHER BUILDINGS ALL AROUND AND LOADS OF LAND 
GUIDE PRICE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
SOUNDS LIKE A BIT OF A BARGAIN TO ME 
THE MAIN SCHOOL BUILDINGS MAKE UP PART OF THE SITE 
AND THERE ARE ALSO ONE AND A QUARTER ACRES OF LAND THE OLD PLAYING FIELDS AND THE PLAYGROUND 
IN TOTAL THERE ARE TWO ACRES OF POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT LAND SO IT SOUNDS LIKE A TEXTBOOK OPPORTUNITY 
WOW 
THE MOMENT YOU WALK THROUGH THE DOOR IT'S 
YOU ARE STEPPING BACK TO YOUR SCHOOLDAYS 
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT THIS IS JUST LIKE MY PRIMARY SCHOOL WAS 
PICTURES ON THE WALLS THE COLOURS OF THE WALLS THEMSELVES I MEAN IT 
THE BUILDING ITSELF IS VICTORIAN IT'S IN VERY GOOD CONDITION AND THAT'S NOT SURPRISING 
COS IT'S ONLY IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS THAT THIS PLACE HAS CLOSED DOWN 
SO YOU'VE STILL GOT ALL THOSE MEMORIES OF THE KIDS WHO WERE HERE 
OH 
A BIT WEIRD ACTUALLY 
THERE ARE JUST SO MANY MEMORIES HERE 
LIKE THOSE TEARFUL FIRST DAYS AT SCHOOL P. E. IN THE GYM HALL AND GETTING YOUR COAT FOR PLAYTIME 
PLAY LITTLE CHILDREN 
NOW WHY AIN'T YOU PLAYING OUTSIDE 
THE SCHOOL IS BEING SOLD AS A DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY 
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE PLANNING PERMISSION YET 
THE VICTORIAN BUILDINGS AREN'T LISTED SO IF YOU HAD PLANNING PERMISSION 
YOU COULD KNOCK THEM DOWN AND REDEVELOP THE WHOLE SITE 
WELL ONE OF THE BIG COSTS YOU'VE GOT TO CONSIDER IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT REDEVELOPING THIS SITE 
IS THE DEMOLITION AND GETTING RID OF THE RUBBISH 
HOWEVER I RECKON THAT THERE'S ENOUGH ARCHITECTURAL SALVAGE IN THIS PLACE 
TO ACTUALLY OFFSET THE COSTS OF THAT DEMOLITION 
I MEAN THINK ABOUT IT A RADIATOR LIKE THIS BELIEVE IT OR NOT IS PROBABLY WORTH ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO FOUR HUNDRED 
BY THE TIME YOU'VE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE SLATES ON THE ROOF 
THE BRICKS THEMSELVES AND STUFF LIKE THIS I RECKON YOU COULD ALMOST PAY 
TO CLEAR THIS SITE OR HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE COME 
AND SAY I'LL TAKE ALL THIS STUFF AWAY AND CLEAR THE SITE FOR YOU FOR NOTHING WORTH CONSIDERING 
IT'D BE A SHAME TO LOSE THE LOVELY PERIOD PROPERTIES BUT DEVELOPING IS OFTEN ABOUT NUMBERS 
SO TIME TO BRUSH UP ON MY MATHS 
O. K. CLASS ATTENTION 
TODAY'S PROJECT ASSESSING THE DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL OF THIS PLOT OF LAND O. K. 
EVERYONE'S ATTENTION PLEASE ESPECIALLY YOU ROBERTS 
O. K. LET'S ASSUME WE GET IT FOR THE GUIDE PRICE OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
RIGHT HOW MANY HOUSES COULD WE GET ON TWO ACRES ROBERTS 
TWENTY FIVE PER ACRE 
THE APPROXIMATE BUILD COST OF A HOUSE ROUGHLY TWO BEDROOMS SIR 
YES SIXTY THOUSAND 
SIXTY THOUSAND EACH 
SO HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO COST US TO DEVELOP THIS BIT OF LAND 
ROBERTS THREE MILLION POUNDS 
RIGHT LET'S ADD A LITTLE BIT OF THINGS FOR ARCHITECTS ET CETERA LET'S SAY ANOTHER HMM TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
SO THAT'S THREE MILLION TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
ROUGHLY HOW MUCH CAN WE SELL THESE HOUSES FOR ROBERTS 
E. R. ONE FIFTY ZERO ZERO ZERO 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TIMES OUR FIFTY HOUSES IS ROUGHLY SEVENTY FIVE MILLION POUNDS 
SO CLASS WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL PROFIT FROM DEVELOPING THIS LAND 
PRESUMABLY OF COURSE YOU CAN GET THE PLANNING PERMISSIONS ME SIR 
ROBERTS E. R. FOUR TWO FIFTY ZERO ZERO ZERO 
CORRECT FOUR MILLION TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT THAT CLASS 
I WANT TO BE A PROPERTY DEVELOPER WHEN I GROW UP SHREWD MOVE MY BOY 
O. K. THAT WAS A BIT OF FUN 
BUT IF I'VE DONE MY SUMS CORRECTLY THEN YOU COULD BE LOOKING AT HUGE PROFITS ON THIS PURCHASE 
I'D BE SAD TO SEE THIS OLD SCHOOL DEMOLISHED BUT I WONDER IF A LOCAL AGENT THINKS 
THERE'S ANY POTENTIAL FOR A DEVELOPER TO CONVERT THE SCHOOL INTO SEPARATE APARTMENTS 
THERE'S POTENTIAL TO DO TWO THINGS 
THEY COULD POSSIBLY REFURBISH THE BUILDINGS THAT ARE ALREADY EXISTING 
POTENTIALLY INTO APARTMENTS 
BUT REALISTICALLY WE THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DEMOLISH THE SITE AND BUILD STARTER HOMES REALLY 
SORT OF SMALLER TWO BED HOUSES 
OBVIOUSLY THERE COULD BE RESTRICTIONS AND IT IS ALL SUBJECT TO PLANNING 
WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT THE COUNCIL WILL PROBABLY INSIST ON HAVING 
AROUND THIRTY PER CENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SOME AREA OF PUBLIC OPEN SPACE 
WELL THERE'S PLENTY OF LAND BUT IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE TO SEE THE PLAYING FIELDS BUILT OVER 
UP IN THE MORNING AND OUT TO SCHOOL 
THE SCHOOL AND THE OLD PLAYING FIELDS WENT TO AUCTION AT A GUIDE PRICE OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
PROVIDED PLANNING PERMISSION WERE OBTAINED 
HOW MUCH COULD A NEW HOUSE OR FLAT WITH A COUPLE OF BEDROOMS SELL FOR 
TWO BED APARTMENTS WILL BE AROUND SORT OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TO ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
AND YOUR TWO BEDROOM HOUSES MEWS HOUSE TYPE HOUSE 
WOULD BE AROUND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE 
RING RING GOES THE BELL 
MY SUMS WEREN'T FAR OUT THEN MY OLD MATHS TEACHER WILL BE VERY PROUD 
WELL WHAT AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY THIS PLACE PRESENTS 
YES THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION QUID IS A LOT OF MONEY FOR A GUIDE PRICE 
BUT LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE GETTING 
AND SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS YOU COULD DO WITH THIS 
IT IS TINGED WITH A BIT OF POIGNANCY THOUGH 
IT'S A SHAME TO SEE THE SCHOOL POTENTIALLY CLOSE AND THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION 
IS THIS GONNA BE THE FINAL BELL 
FOR OUR SCHOOL 
LOT TWENTY THREE LADIES AND GENTLEMAN

AT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THE FIRST TIME 
AT EIGHT HUNDRED FOR THE SECOND TIME 
THIRD AND FINAL TIME AT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND 
ALL DONE 
SO THE FORMER SPRING STREET SCHOOL WAS BOUGHT FOR EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND 
THE WINNING BID WAS MADE BY ERIC AND HIS BUSINESS PARTNER BINDA 
ERIC USED TO WORK FOR A SPORTSWEAR BUSINESS BUT ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO HE JOINED BINDA'S PROPERTY COMPANY 
THEY HAVE AN IMPRESSIVE PORTFOLIO OF OVER TWO HUNDRED PROPERTIES THE LATEST BEING HERE AT SPRING STREET 
SCHO O. O. OL'S OUT FOR 
SO WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU FIRST CAME ROUND THIS PLACE 
WELL IT WAS TWO FOLD WHEN WE FIRST CAME TO VISIT IT 
I MEAN PRIMARILY WE LOOKED AT THERE IS AN ACRE OF LAND NEXT DOOR 
HMM WHICH IS THE FORMER PLAYING FIELDS WHICH OBVIOUSLY HAS GOT A NEW BUILD INTEREST 
AND THEN THERE'S THE BUILDINGS THEMSELVES THE EXISTING BUILDINGS 
SO AGAIN WE THOUGHT CAN WE UTILISE THE BUILDINGS WAS OUR FIRST INITIAL THOUGHT 
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE DO A LOT OF RENTING OUT ON A COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL BASIS 
IF NOT IS THERE ANY ORDERS ON PRESERVATION ORDERS CAN WE KNOCK THE BUILDING 
THEN YOU'VE GOT A TWO ACRE SITE 
WE LOOKED AT BOTH ANGLES WE LIKED THE SOUND OF BOTH OF THEM SO WE THOUGHT WE'D GO AHEAD 
AS A COMPANY AND PURCHASE IT 
IT'S NOT THE FIRST SCHOOL THEY'VE BOUGHT 
BEARING IN MIND THEY PAID EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND AT AUCTION FOR IT AND THE PLAYING FIELD 
WHAT ARE THEIR PLANS FOR SPRING STREET 
WE'VE GOT SOME OPTIONS WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF OFFERS ALREADY 
FOR WHAT WELL BOTH REALLY TO WALK AWAY REALLY YEAH YEAH 
SOMEBODY'S OFFERED TO BUY IT OFF YOU YES ALREADY HOW MUCH FOR ER I WON'T TELL ANYBODY 
NO IT'S A VERY GOOD OFFER WE DECLINED THAT OFFER AT THIS STAGE 
WHICH ISN'T BAD TO SAY WE HAVEN'T COMPLETED YET WELL I HOPE YOU'RE BREAKING OUT THE CHAMPAGNE 
BECAUSE THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN A SUCCESS STORY I KNOW 
IT WAS A VERY GENEROUS OFFER BUT THAT OFFER COULD COME AGAIN AND IT'LL NOT GO DOWN IN THE NEXT YEAR 
WHILE WE MAKE DECISIONS BUT WE'RE VERY CLOSE 
TO MORE OR LESS RENTING PART OF THE BUILDINGS OUT ANYWAY TO BE FAIR 
WHAT THE EXISTING BUILDINGS HERE OR SOME OF THE SMALLER ONES AROUND 
HMM THE SCHOOL SITE ITSELF AGAIN WE'VE HAD ANOTHER OFFER OF AN INTERESTED PARTY LOCAL 
WANT TO DO A PLAYGROUP CENTRE ON THE WHOLE SITE 
TOP MARKS FOR ERIC AND BINDA 
THEY DID THEIR HOMEWORK AND PAID A VERY ATTRACTIVE EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THIS SCHOOL ON A TWO ACRE SITE 
THEY'RE ALL CAST WE'RE ON FOR A SMALL FORTUNE BUT IT'D BE NICE TO KEEP THEM SEEN THE BEAMS 
THEY'VE ALREADY TURNED DOWN ONE OFFER FOR THE LAND AND HAVE A TENANT LINED UP FOR THE SCHOOL 
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT FOR YOU I MEAN WHAT'S THE TIMESCALES AND WHAT'S THE SORT OF BUDGETS 
AND WHAT WILL YOU DO IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY 
YEAH IT'S DIFFICULT TO PUT A TIMESCALE YEAH 
I THINK IMMEDIATELY IT'S JUST A CASE OF TAKING IT AS IT COMES 
HMM WE'RE NOT IN A RUSH OURSELVES YEAH 
HOPEFULLY IF WE CAN RENT THIS SITE OUT THAT SIDE OF IT'S NOT REALLY A PROBLEM 
SO WE CAN JUST SIT BACK AND WAIT AND SEE WHAT OFFERS COME IN 
WHATEVER HAPPENS CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU I HOPE IT TURNS OUT THANKS REALLY WELL FOR YOU BOTH 
WELL THIS JUST GOES TO PROVE THAT IF YOU'VE GOT MONEY 
YOU CAN SPECULATE TO ACCUMULATE I DON'T THINK IT'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER ERIC BINDA AND HIS BROTHERS 
WILL MAKE MONEY BUT A QUESTION OF HOW MUCH THEY WILL MAKE 
WILL THEY KEEP THE SCHOOL THOUGH AND WHAT WILL THEY DO WITH THAT LAND 
LET'S FIND OUT LATER IN THE SHOW 
COMING UP 
THERE COULD BE A SINKING FEELING AT THIS INDUSTRIAL UNIT IN KENT 
WOW 
WHAT A SPACE 
BACK AT SCHOOL NEAR NOTTINGHAM HAS ANYONE LEARNED FROM MY LESSON 
HOW MUCH COULD WE SELL THESE HOUSES FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TIMES OUR FIFTY HOUSES 
SEVEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
AND IN HASLEMERE THERE WERE TWO REASONS WHY ANDY BOUGHT THIS HOUSE 
THE WEAVING BIT WAS THE INITIAL DRAW TO IT BUT NOW IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT IT'S A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE 
IT IS PRETTY UNUSUAL WHEN THE NAME OF A HOUSE ATTRACTS BUYERS TO THE AUCTION 
DUNROAMIN AND THE RETREAT DON'T EXACTLY PACK THEM IN 
BUT THE WEAVING HOUSE IN HASLEMERE APPEALED TO ANDY AND HIS WIFE SARAH ON TWO COUNTS 
FIRST BECAUSE IT WAS JUST ROUND THE CORNER FROM WHERE THEY LIVED 
AND SECOND BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH WEAVERS IDEAL 
THEY PAID TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND FOR THE UNUSUAL HOUSE THAT ONCE DID EXACTLY WHAT ITS NAME IMPLIES 
ANDY WHICH PART OF THE HOUSE WAS THIS PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN IN 
THIS IS MORE OR LESS THIS ROOM 
THE WHOLE OF THE TOP FLOOR WAS PUT OUT TO WEAVING 
SO THERE ARE TEN LOOMS HERE 
THREE MONTHS LATER WE'VE THREADED OUR WAY BACK TO SEE IF ANDY AND SARAH HAVE MOVED IN 
WELL THEY CERTAINLY HAVE 
THEY'VE TRANSFORMED THE WEAVING HOUSE INTO A HOME 
THEIR FAMILY'S FURNISHINGS MAKE IT FEEL REALLY COSY 
THEY'VE CHANGED THE COLOUR SCHEME IN THE KITCHEN AND UP AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE 
THE THREE BEDROOMS HAVE BEEN VERY TASTEFULLY DECORATED 
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK IN THE WEAVER'S HOUSE THAT LAIDBACK LIFESTYLE LOOMS LARGE 
IT DOES FEEL LIKE HOME FOR US IT FELT LIKE HOME ON THE FIRST NIGHT 
STRAIGHTAWAY IT WAS IT FELT LIVED IN IT FELT VERY HOMELY WE PUT THE LITTLE LIGHTS ON 
IN THE CORNERS OF THE ROOM AND IT JUST FELT LIKE WE'D LIVED HERE FOR A LONG LONG TIME 
THE HOUSE HAD BEEN UNOCCUPIED BUT HAD RECENTLY BEEN DECORATED AND WAS IN FANTASTIC CONDITION 
SO VERY LITTLE NEEDED TO BE DONE 
SO IN THE LOUNGE THE FLOORBOARDS WERE ALL PAINTED BROWN SO FAIRLY NASTY 
WE SPENT A COUPLE OF DAYS SANDING THEM DOWN 
AND THEN WE OILED THEM SO IT'S A LOVELY WARM FEEL TO THEM 
AND THEN REALLY SORT OF PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER IN HERE 
AS THEY'RE BOTH WEAVERS THE HOUSE MAKES A VERY APPROPRIATE HOME 
THEY MET WHEN ANDY RAN A TEXTILE MILL AND ALTHOUGH HE'S NOW A WEBSITE DESIGNER 
SARAH CONTINUES TO WEAVE ON A HAND LOOM 
SHE TOOK A TEXTILE DEGREE AT ART SCHOOL AND HAS ROPED IN AN OLD FRIEND TO HELP 
STEPHANIE'S A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF OURS FROM A LONG TIME BACK 
SHE HELPED US TO MOVE IN SHE HELPED US TO STYLE THE PLACE 
I'VE LITERALLY JUST BEEN AN EXTRA PAIR OF HANDS 
BUT I SUPPOSE BECAUSE MY BACKGROUND'S IN INTERIOR STYLING I HELPED 
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS I THINK WAS JUST TO CREATE A SORT OF COSY HOME FEEL 
BECAUSE THEY DID COME FROM QUITE A SMALL HOUSE SOMETIMES THEIR FURNITURE COULD LOOK A BIT LOST 
SO IT WAS JUST TO CAREFULLY PLACING THINGS IN ROOMS TO STILL GIVE A COSY FEEL REALLY 
STEPHANIE'S ACHIEVED A GREAT LOOK THROUGHOUT 
EVEN THE KITCHEN'S TAKEN ON A COUNTRY COTTAGE FEEL 
WELL THIS IS A GREAT ROOM WE'VE 
THIS UNIT HERE WAS COMING OUT FROM THE WALL WE TOOK IT AWAY TO SAND THE FLOOR AND WAX IT AND OIL IT 
AND THEN WE JUST PUT IT BACK IN THE CORNER THERE TO KEEP IT OUT OF THE WAY 
WE JUST PUT THIS SHELF UP AND THIS UNIT HERE 
THESE CUPBOARDS WERE ALL FINE BUT THE WRONG COLOUR 
THEY WERE A HORRIBLE BLUE SO SARAH POINTED THESE THIS NICE GREEN AND PUT SOME NEW HANDLES ON 
SO I THINK IT'S REALLY BROUGHT IT BACK TO LIFE 
FOR ANYONE MOVING HOUSE IT CAN BE TRAUMATIC 
BUT FOR ANDY AND SARAH'S TWO BOYS WELL IT WAS JUST ANOTHER DAY 
WE'RE IN MINE AND SAMUEL'S BEDROOM 
AND I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S GOT BIG WINDOWS 
AND IT'S GOT MORE SPACE TO KEEP ALL OUR TOYS IN AND EVERYTHING 
THERE'S BEEN VERY LITTLE WORK REQUIRED ON THIS HOUSE SO HAVE ANDY AND SARAH HAD TO SPEND MUCH MONEY 
IN TERMS OF COST IT HASN'T REALLY COST US ANYTHING OTHER THAN BUYING SOME OTHER BITS AND PIECES 
OTHER BITS OF FURNITURE THAT WOULD FIT THE HOUSE 
I THINK COSTS GOING FORWARDS ARE GOING TO BE ON THE GARDEN 
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP A FIGHTING FUND FOR THE FACT THAT IT'S A WOODEN BUILDING 
AND YOU JUST NEED TO BE SENSIBLE ABOUT IT 
NOW THEY'VE SETTLED IN HAVE THEY BEEN DISTURBED BY THE CAR PARK AT THE BACK 
OR BY THAT BUSY RAILWAY LINE 
THE CAR PARK HASN'T BEEN A PROBLEM IN THE SLIGHTEST AND WE QUITE LIKE THE TRAINS 
IT'S SORT OF A LITTLE BIT OF LIFE GOING PAST 
SO WE WATCH THE PEOPLE GOING BY AND WAVE AT THEM 
THE WEAVING HOUSE IS PROBABLY A BIT OF A LANDMARK YOU DON'T SEE MANY LIKE THIS ON A TRAIN JOURNEY 
TIME TO SEE IF TWO LOCAL ESTATE AGENTS THINK THAT THE PROPERTY IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK 
FOLLOWING ANDY'S ARRIVAL 
I'M IMMENSELY IMPRESSED WITH THE WORK THEY'VE DONE 
IT FEELS MORE SPACIOUS AND LIVED IN AND LOVED 
IT'S AN UPSIDE DOWN HOUSE 
ALL THE BEDROOMS HAVE GOT EN SUITE ACCOMMODATION WHICH IS FANTASTIC 
YES IT WOULD BE AN ADVANTAGE IF IT HAD A CLOAKROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR 
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE WALKING THROUGH A BEDROOM TO A CLOAKROOM 
THE KITCHEN IS AMAZING THEY'VE DONE A LOVELY JOB 
IT FEELS HOMELY AND IT'S NICE THAT THEY'VE GOT SPACE FOR A TABLE 
IT IS A SMALL GARDEN BUT I THINK THAT CAN BE OVERCOME 
IF THEY DO SOME CLEVER REDESIGNING AT THE FRONT 
ANDY AND SARAH PAID TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND FOR THE HOUSE AT AUCTION 
WHAT'S IT WORTH NOW WILL THEY SEE A RISE 
I THINK IF I WAS TO MARKET THE PROPERTY TODAY 
I WOULD MARKET IT AROUND THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY LEVEL 
I'D PUT THIS ON THE MARKET AT A GUIDE OF FOUR HUNDRED 
THAT'S AT LEAST SEVENTY THOUSAND MORE THAN ANDY PAID QUITE AN INCREASE 
IT IS A LOT MORE YES WE PAID H. M. TWO EIGHTY ZERO ZERO ZERO I THINK FOR IT 
BUT I THINK IT'S THE VALUE IT'S ADDED TO OUR LIFE THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
WE BOUGHT THE HOUSE FOR THE CHARACTER OF THE HOUSE FOR THE HISTORY FOR THE SOUL OF THE HOUSE 
WE DIDN'T BUY IT TO MAKE ANY PROFIT ON IT OR ANYTHING WE BOUGHT IT TO LIVE IN AND TO BE A FAMILY HOME 
THE WEAVING HOUSE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN TRANSFORMED 
WE'RE REALLY HAPPY THAT WE FOUND IT WE DIDN'T WANT TO MOVE FROM WHERE WE WERE 
BUT THIS PLACE FOUND US IT'S SO CHARACTERFUL IT'S JUST RIGHT FOR US 
IT'S THE BEST MOVE THAT WE'VE MADE 
WE'RE IN KENT JUST ACROSS THE RIVER MEDWAY FROM ROCHESTER 
BUT WE COULD BE A WORLD AWAY FROM THAT HISTORIC CITY 
AT AUCTION YOU GET ALL SORTS OF PROPERTY FROM THE QUIRKY TO THE DERELICT TO PLOTS OF LAND 
AND ALSO YOU GET COMMERCIAL PROPERTY 
WELL I'M HERE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF ROCHESTER TO VIEW THIS 
IT'S AN INDUSTRIAL UNIT ON A PURPOSE BUILT ESTATE 
AND IT WAS GUIDED AT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TO TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
THE UNIT IS AT THE END OF THE ROAD WITH ONLY ONE OTHER BUSINESS NEXT TO IT 
THERE'S ONE BIG ADVANTAGE IT'S THE FREEHOLD OF THE BUILDING THAT WENT UNDER THE HAMMER 
NOW MY BACKGROUND IS IN RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY BUT I KNOW THERE ARE CERTAIN BOXES 
YOU HAVE TO TICK FOR A BUSINESS PREMISES 
NOW LOCATION ACCESSIBILITY AND SQUARE FOOTAGE 
NOW THIS UNIT IS EASY TO GET TO IT'S JUST OFF THE MAIN ROAD LEADING TO THE M. TWO 
IT'S GOT PARKING FOR NINE CARS OUTSIDE AND AS FOR SQUARE FOOTAGE 
WELL LET'S TAKE A LOOK AROUND INSIDE 
WELL THIS IS THE HALLWAY YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF STORAGE IN HERE 
THERE'S A DOWNSTAIRS TOILET IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T FEEL PLUSH IN HERE 
IT'S GOT THAT INDUSTRIAL FEEL 
IT'S PRACTICAL ATTRACTIVE AND SURPRISINGLY SMALL 
SO IT DOESN'T LOOK THAT BIG UNTIL YOU GET TO HERE 
WOW WHAT A SPACE 
THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SQUARE FOOT TO BE PRECISE 
IT'S GOT GREAT CEILING HEIGHT IN HERE WHICH WILL BE EXCELLENT FOR STORAGE 
YOU COULD PUT UP BIG RACKS IN HERE 
NOW I DO KNOW THE SHUTTER DOOR AT THE BACK HERE IS BROKEN 
AND THERE'S A BIG OLD DENT ON THIS WALL OVER HERE 
WHERE A FORK LIFT TRUCK DROVE INTO IT SO THERE'S A FEW REPAIRS TO LAY OUT FOR 
BUT WHAT YOU ARE BUYING HERE IS THE SPACE AND THERE IS LOTS OF IT 
ONCE THE SHUTTER DOOR'S REPAIRED YOU COULD DRIVE SOME SERIOUS STOCK IN AND OUT 
IF YOU'RE TEMPTED BY THE FREEHOLD POTENTIAL OF THIS PROPERTY THERE'S MORE GOOD NEWS IN STORE 
THERE'S ANOTHER WHOLE FLOOR 
SO HERE WE ARE UPSTAIRS IN THE OFFICE NOW THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT UP HERE 
YOU'VE GOT A TOILET AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT DOES LOOK A BIT DATED 
IT COULD DO WITH SOME PAINTING 
BUT THIS WHOLE UNIT CURRENTLY HAS B. TWO AND B. EIGHT USAGE 
SO IT'S O. K. TO USE FOR GENERAL INDUSTRIAL AND STORAGE 
IT'S ALSO O. K. TO CHANGE THE USAGE TO B. ONE 
SO YOU CAN USE IT AS OFFICES WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH PLANNING 
BUT THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS 
YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY BUSINESS THAT INVOLVES MAJOR NOISE NOXIOUS SMELLS AND SUBSTANCES 
JUST AS WELL REALLY BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK OUT THE WINDOW YOU GET A GREAT VIEW OF THE LOCAL TIP 
I'VE INVITED A LOCAL ESTATE AGENT ALONG TO DISCOVER MORE ABOUT THIS UNIT AND THE INDUSTRIAL ESTATE 
UNLESS HE'S STOPPED FOR A CUP OF TEA ON THE WAY BY MY RECKONING HE SHOULD BE HERE ANY MOMENT 
FOR RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES I'M MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT GIVING ADVICE 
BUT KERB APPEAL AND AVOCADO BATH SUITES AREN'T SO RELEVANT HERE 
SO HOW DOES THIS LOCATION RATE FOR SMALL FACTORY UNITS 
IT'S A GOOD BASIC INDUSTRIAL ESTATE IT'S NOT A BUSINESS PARK 
BEFORE IT WAS AN INDUSTRIAL ESTATE IT WAS MARSHLAND 
NOTHING MORE THAN THAT 
LOTS OF LITTLE TRIBUTARIES OFF THE RIVER 
THE WAY THE UNITS ARE BUILT ON POWERFUL FOUNDATIONS WITH BIG LONG TUBES OF CONCRETE 
GOING INTO THE GROUND MEANS THAT THE UNITS ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE 
BUT THE GROUND AREAS AROUND IT WHICH ARE STILL ON UNDERLYING SOFT GROUND ARE SINKING 
THAT MEANS THERE'S OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENTIAL MOVEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO 
SO THE RAMPS FOR EXAMPLE INTO THE UNIT ARE GETTING STEEPER AND THAT CAN 
AND HAS BEEN A PROBLEM ON SOME UNITS ON THE ESTATE HERE 
BUT THIS ONE LOOKS GOOD AND THE MOVEMENT LOOKS TO BE FAIRLY MINIMAL 
THERE'S A MANHOLE COVER WHICH YOU CAN SEE OUTSIDE 
WHERE THERE IS SEVEN INCHES OF MOVEMENT AROUND THAT 
SO THAT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT ANY PURCHASER WOULD NEED TO DEAL WITH 
AN EASY THING TO MISS UNLESS YOU'VE GOT AN EXPERIENCED EYE 
WHO KNOWS MAYBE YOU COULD END UP HIGH AND DRY IN THIS UNIT 
AS THE SURROUNDING LAND SINKS BACK INTO THE MARSH 
ONE BIG ADVANTAGE HERE IS THAT THE UNIT WAS SOLD AS A FREEHOLD OPPORTUNITY 
SO HOW MUCH INCOME COULD YOU GENERATE 
WELL THE POTENTIAL RENT IF YOU WERE LETTING 
WOULD BE IN THE ORDER OF TWENTY TWO THOUSAND 
WHICH REPRESENTS ABOUT SIX PER SQUARE FOOT 
THAT WOULD REPRESENT A RETURN OF TEN PER CENT 
IF THE UNIT WAS BOUGHT AT THE LOWER END OF THE GUIDE PRICE RANGE OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TO TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE RESALE VALUE 
IF THE UNIT WAS IN GOOD ORDER AND IT WAS PURCHASED BY AN OWNER OCCUPIER 
I WOULD EXPECT IT TO REACH SOMETHING IN THE ORDER OF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
SO UNITS LIKE THIS ONE HAVE A SCARCITY VALUE 
THEY DON'T COME ONTO THE MARKET VERY OFTEN AND THAT MAKES THIS A VERY DESIRABLE PROPERTY 
WHAT ABOUT THE CAR PARK AND THE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS OF THE LAND SINKING 
LET'S FIND OUT IF THAT GAVE THE BIDDERS A SINKING FEELING WHEN IT WENT TO AUCTION 
LOT NO ONE HUNDRED FOUR IS THE MODERN FREEHOLD INDUSTRIAL PREMISES 
MASSIVE BUILDING THIS ONE 
GOOD FREEHOLD PREMISES 
EXCELLENT VALUE AT THIS SORT OF GUIDE OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TO TWO HUNDRED FORTY 
WHERE YOU GOING TO START ME IS THERE A BID OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TO START ME ON THE WAY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY 
I'M ON THE WAY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY I'VE GOT 
TWO HUNDRED THIRTY IF YOU LIKE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY I HAVE AND FORTY NOW IF YOU LIKE 
TWO HUNDRED FORTY I'VE GOT SITTING IN FRONT 
TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE I'M OBLIGED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY IT'S AGAINST YOU 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY IT'S WITH YOU AND FIFTY FIVE 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE AND SIXTY 
AND SIXTY FIVE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE AND SEVENTY AND SEVENTY FIVE 
AT EIGHTY AT EIGHTY FIVE AND NINETY NINETY FIVE 
AND THREE HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED FIVE AND TEN THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE 
THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE KEEP GOING THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
AND THIRTY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND 
AT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND I'M BID TO THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE YELLOW JUMPER ON 
THREE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO IF IT HELPS IT'S BEEN WITH YOU A WHILE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO 
ONE MORE GO THREE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO AND FIVE 
THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE AND EIGHT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT 
THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE I'VE GOT I'M GOING TO BE SELLING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IF YOU WANT TO BID THREE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT COME BACK IN 
THREE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT HE SAYS YES 
THREE HUNDRED FORTY'S AGAINST YOU HE SAID YES QUICKLY 
FORTY TWO AT THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND I'M BID SO WE'RE BACK TO THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE YELLOW JUMPER 
FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND FOR THE SECOND ONE MORE CHANCE 
THREE HUNDRED FORTY FOR THE THIRD AND FINAL TIME HE'S LOOKING AWAY 
IT'S YOURS SIR FOR THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND WELL DONE 
THAT FINAL BID OF THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND WAS MADE BY SONNY WHO PAID ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OVER THE GUIDE PRICE 
WITH HIS BUSINESS PARTNER STEVE THEY'VE GOT MANY YEARS' EXPERIENCE IN BUILDING AND CONTRACTING 
WHY DID THEY CHOOSE THIS INDUSTRIAL UNIT 
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A PREMISES WELL WE HAVE 
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A PREMISES FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND THERE'S A VERY 
THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF WAREHOUSES FREEHOLD WAREHOUSES TO PURCHASE 
WE SAW THIS THE NIGHT BEFORE IN THE AUCTION CATALOGUE AND WE WENT DOWN THERE 
IT WAS A MATTER OF WE HAD TO HAVE IT NOW SO 
I KNOW I PAID A BIT OVER THE ODDS HE DIDN'T MIND 
HOLD ON A MINUTE YEAH YOU PAID THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND FOR THIS YEAH 
AND IT WAS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN YOU PROBABLY WANTED TO PAY 
WE THOUGHT WE'D GET IT FOR ABOUT THREE WE DID WE THOUGHT WE'D GET IT A BIT LOWER 
WE DEFINITELY WANTED TO BUY SOMETHING FREEHOLD 
BECAUSE WE KNEW ALL THE UPGRADING WE WANTED TO DO TO THE PREMISES 
AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT WITH A LEASEHOLD PURCHASE 
SO WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH IT 
WE'LL HAVE A MEZZANINE FLOOR ALL THE WAY ACROSS 
MADE OUT OF STEEL FRAME AND WE'LL GOING TO HAVE A BOARDROOM DOWN HERE 
A COUPLE OF SECURE UNITS HERE FOR OUR POWER TOOLS AND WHAT HAVE YOU 
UPSTAIRS A FEW MORE OFFICES PERHAPS ONE OPEN PLAN OR PERHAPS A FEW LITTLE ONES 
STEVE'S FAMILY HAVE BEEN IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY FOR YEARS 
SONNY'S FATHER OWNS A BUILDERS' MERCHANTS AND THEY'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER SINCE THEY WERE LITTLE BOYS 
THEY'VE BOTH BEEN BUILDERS THEMSELVES 
SONNY BOUGHT HIS FIRST PROPERTY AT EIGHTEEN WHEN HE WAS AT UNIVERSITY 
IT WAS A BASEMENT FLAT THAT HE RENTED OUT 
HE'S ALSO OWNED A FISH AND CHIP SHOP AND BEEN A FITNESS INSTRUCTOR 
NOW WITH STEVE AS A BUSINESS PARTNER THEY'RE RUNNING A CONTRACTING BUSINESS AS WELL 
AND THE PLAN IS FOR STEVE AND SONNY'S BUSINESSES TO COME TOGETHER UNDER THIS ONE ROOF 
SO WHAT IS IT THAT YOU GUYS DO 
WE COVER EVERYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY 
FROM SELLING THE MATERIAL ALL THE WAY TO BUYING REFURBISHMENTS NEW BUILDS WE'VE DONE IT ALL 
WE ALSO ON THE DEVELOPMENT SIDE OF THINGS WE'VE ENCUMBERED A LAND AGENCY 
SO FROM POINT OF SOURCING LAND FOR OURSELVES AND OTHER DEVELOPERS 
AND SOMETIMES WE SELL THOSE PROPERTIES OTHER TIMES WE KEEP THEM FOR PERSONAL PORTFOLIOS 
SO DO YOU HAVE CURRENT OFFICES THAT YOU'LL BE MOVING OUT OF TO MOVE INTO HERE 
WELL YES I'VE GOT OFFICES NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE 
AND THIS PROJECT WE'RE DOING HERE IS JOINT 
BECAUSE WE'RE BRINGING MY CONTRACTING PART OF MY BUSINESS TOGETHER WITH SONNY'S 
SO WE CAN BRING ALL OUR OFFICES TOGETHER HIS OFFICE AND MINE WE'LL ME RGE I. 
IT'S ABOUT TIME TO DO THAT 
CLEARLY SONNY AND STEVE ARE THINKING BIG 
THIS THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND INVESTMENT WILL BE THEIR NEW HEADQUARTERS 
THEY'VE GOT AMBITIOUS PLANS 
I THINK WE'LL BE TAKING OUR NEXT STEP UP IN OUR INDUSTRY AND SETTING IT UP IN SUCH A FASHION 
THAT WE'VE GOT AN ACCOUNTS DEPARTMENT A BUYING DEPARTMENT A SURVEYING DEPARTMENT 
AND THE MEETING ROOMS ALL TO CREATE YOU KNOW THE NEXT PART OF OUR JOURNEY 
TO GO FORWARD AND DO THOSE BIGGER JOBS 
IN A MORE PROFESSIONAL MANNER AND THE SET UP TO OBVIOUSLY LET US ACHIEVE THAT 
HAVE YOU GOT A BUDGET IN MIND SONNY FOR THIS WELL I WAS THINKING AROUND THIRTY TO FORTY K. 
LISTEN GUYS IT'S BEEN REALLY LOVELY MEETING YOU HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO TAKE YOU 
IF WE ALLOW EIGHT TO TEN WEEKS I THINK IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR US TO TURN IT AROUND 
IN OUR WAY TO THE STANDARD WE WANT 
MEZZANINE READY TO WALK ACROSS 
EVERYTHING YOU'LL PUT YOUR FEET UP AND HAVE SOME TEA HARD HAT ON 
YOU WON'T NEED THAT AT THAT STAGE 
IT'S BEEN LOVELY TO MEET YOU I CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK AND HAVE THAT TEA NO PROBLEM 
SEE YOU SOON THANKS THANK YOU 
WE GET TO SEE A RANGE OF PROPERTIES ON THIS PROGRAMME 
SOMETIMES THE BATHROOM IS BUST OR THE LOFT LEAKS BUT ON THIS ONE 
SONNY AND STEVE HAVE TWO FLOORS TO TACKLE AS THEY TRY TO RELOCATE THEIR TWO BUSINESSES 
AT THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND I DO THINK THE BOYS PAID OVER THE ODDS FOR THIS 
BUT IT SUITS THEIR NEEDS PERFECTLY 
THEY HAVE BIG PLANS AND IT'S A BIG ENOUGH SPACE TO ENABLE THEM TO EXPAND 
THEY'RE CERTAINLY THINKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE 
FIND OUT LATER IN THE SHOW IF SONNY AND STEVE MANAGE TO BUILD THEIR PERFECT BUSINESS BASE 
THE CLOCK HAS BEEN TICKING AND WORK SHOULD BE WELL UNDERWAY ON THOSE PROPERTIES 
BUT WILL THE PILES OF BRICKS AND THE BAGS OF CEMENT HAVE GONE 
WILL THE PAINT BE DRYING ON THE WALLS LET'S FIND OUT 
WHEN WE WERE LAST IN HUCKNALL NEAR NOTTINGHAM ERIC AND BINDA 
HAD BOUGHT THIS FORMER SCHOOL AND FURTHER ONE ACRE OF LAND FOR EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND 
THEY WORK TOGETHER IN THEIR OWN PROPERTY DEVELOPING COMPANY 
ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO PLANNING PERMISSION THERE WERE PLENTY OF OPTIONS 
WOULD THEY KNOCK DOWN THE SCHOOL AND APPLY TO REDEVELOP THE WHOLE SITE 
OR MAYBE RENT OUT THE SCHOOL AND JUST DEVELOP THE LAND 
WE GAVE THEM A WHOLE YEAR TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK AND HAVE RETURNED TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED 
THE SCHOOL IS STILL STANDING BUT WILL DEVELOPMENT HAVE STARTED ROUND THE BACK 
TO FIND OUT LET'S ASK BINDA AND ERIC 
WE HAD TWO DIFFERENT OPTIONS ONE WAS TO DEVELOP 
WHICH WOULD TAKE QUITE A BIT LONGER OR ONE WAS TO TRY AND RENT OUT 
WE GOT AN APPROACH FROM ONE OF THE LOCAL AGENTS 
WITH A COUPLE OF TENANTS THAT APPROACHED US ALMOST IMMEDIATELY 
SO THAT REALLY FINALISED EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO WITH THE SITE FROM THERE 
IT KEPT THE BUILDINGS INTACT AND SERVED THE LOCAL COMMUNITY WHICH WAS THE PREFERRED OPTION 
HMM AND IT'S DOING SORT OF THE SAME THING AS IT WAS ANYWAY 
O. K. IT'S PRE SCHOOL CHILDREN YEAH BUT IT'S KEPT THE THEME GOING REALLY 
YES THE KIDS ARE BACK 
IN THE MAIN SCHOOL BUILDING THE CLASSROOMS HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO A CHILDREN'S PLAY CENTRE 
WITH BALL POOL CLIMBING ROPES AND SLIDES 
IT'S BEEN SET UP BY TWO FRIENDS JULIE AND KERRY 
THEY WORKED TOGETHER IN ADVERTISING BUT DECIDED IT WAS TIME FOR A CHANGE AS JULIE EXPLAINS 
IT'S A NEW BUSINESS FOR BOTH OF US PREVIOUSLY WE'VE ALWAYS WORKED FOR SOMEONE ELSE 
BUT WE JUST THOUGHT LET'S GIVE IT A GO YOU GET ONE CHANCE IN LIFE SO WE DID 
THEY'D BEEN HUNTING FOR A RESIDENTIAL UNIT 
BUT COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY CAME ACROSS THE SCHOOL 
WE THOUGHT IT'D BE QUITE EASY WITH IT BEING A SCHOOL TO CHANGE THE USE INTO A PLAY CENTRE 
BUT IT TOOK SIX MONTHS 
WE HAD TO DO QUITE A LOT OF WORK TO THE BUILDING OBVIOUSLY TO GET IT TO WHERE WE ARE NOW 
IT'S BEEN A CLASS ACT 
NOT JUST THE SCHOOL ROOMS BUT ONE OF THE OFFICES HAVE ALSO BEEN CONVERTED INTO A KITCHEN 
SO IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE END OF THE TUNNEL FOR THE SCHOOL 
BUT WHAT'S THEIR PLAN FOR THAT ONE ACRE PLOT OF LAND 
ARE THEY LOOKING TO DEVELOP THAT 
THE LAND OVER THE LAST YEAR HAS REMAINED EMPTY 
WE'VE JUST AS A COMPANY EXPLORED OUR OPTIONS WITH DEVELOPERS 
THE POTENTIAL OF SELLING IT ARCHITECTS 
AND JUST GENERAL CONSULTATION WITH AGENTS OF THE VIABILITY OF THE LAND 
OF COURSE ANY DEVELOPMENT WILL DEPEND ON PLANNING PERMISSION BEING GRANTED 
PLANS WILL NEED TO BE SUBMITTED AND THAT'S STILL SOME WAY OFF 
AT LEAST HAVING PAID EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THE SCHOOL AND THE LAND 
THEY ARE GENERATING SOME INCOME FROM THE ACTIVITY CENTRE 
WE'RE RENTING OUT THE SITE CURRENTLY AT FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND PER ANNUM 
WITH A FIVE YEAR LEASE WITH A BREAK CLAUSE TO EXTEND FOR A FURTHER FIVE YEARS 
GOOD NEWS FOR THE BOYS BUT THAT FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND RENT IS A LOT FOR THE GIRLS TO FIND EACH YEAR 
WHEN WE TOOK ON THE LEASE WE DID ASK THAT WE COULD SUBLET ANY OF THE BUILDINGS 
FORTUNATELY WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LET ONE OF THE BUILDINGS ALREADY 
IT'S A LOCAL TRAINING COMPANY THAT ARE EXPANDING 
AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE WORKING FROM ONE OF THE OTHER BUILDINGS 
AND THAT'S HELPED THE GIRLS' CASH FLOW NO END 
ALL IN ALL YOU'RE JUST ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL 
WE PAY FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND A YEAR AND WE'RE ASKING SIXTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR FROM THE TRAINING COMPANY 
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY PAYING A THIRD TOWARDS OUR RENT IT'S HELPING US A GREAT DEAL 
HEY TEACHER 
LEAVE THEM KIDS ALONE 
WE'VE BEEN OPEN ABOUT THREE MONTHS NOW AND IT'S GOING FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH 
WE'VE JUST HAD OUR FIRST SCHOOL HOLIDAY AND IT PROVED REALLY POPULAR 
WE WERE PACKED EVERY DAY AND WE'RE GETTING LOADS OF REPEAT BUSINESS 
IT SOUNDS LIKE A FANTASTIC SUCCESS FOR THE GIRLS' FIRST BUSINESS VENTURE 
WHAT ABOUT ERIC AND BINDA DO THEY FEEL THEIR INVESTMENT HAS BEEN AS REWARDING 
IF YOU CAN GAUGE SUCCESS AT THE FACT THAT WE'VE MANAGED TO FIND A TENANT THAT COVERS OUR COSTS 
FROM CAPITAL THAT WE'VE OBVIOUSLY BORROWED 
AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME POINT WE'VE STILL GOT A LOT OF LAND THERE THAT WE CAN DEVELOP 
THEN I'D SAY THAT'S QUITE SUCCESSFUL DEFINITELY 
SO EVERYONE SEEMS HAPPY 
TIME TO SEE IF TWO PROPERTY EXPERTS WILL BE AS ENTHUSIASTIC 
ABOUT THE MANY BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES HERE 
IT'S QUITE SIMILAR TO HOW IT WAS ORIGINALLY WHEN I FIRST VISITED 
HOWEVER AT THE TIME THERE WERE LOTS OF POTENTIAL OPTIONS 
NOW WE'VE ACTUALLY GOT SOME OF THE BUILDINGS RENTED OUT WHICH IS EXCELLENT 
I THINK THEY'VE DONE EXTREMELY WELL 
I THINK THEY'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE INDEED 
I THINK THE RENT OF FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND IS A GOOD LEVEL OF RENT 
I THINK IT'S A FULL REPAIRING LEASE AND THAT'S IN THEIR FAVOUR AS WELL 
THEY'VE GOT FIVE YEARS OF RENTAL INCOME BUT WHAT IS ERIC AND BINDA'S PLAN FOR THE LAND 
TIMESCALES FOR THE LAND 
FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE A VIEW OF SITTING ON IT AREN'T WE 
HMM AND JUST SEE WHAT TRANSPIRES AS THE YEAR WEARS ON 
SO ARE THEY SITTING ON AN ASSET 
REMEMBER THEY PAID EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THE SCHOOL AND THE LAND 
WHAT'S THE LAND NOW WORTH AS IT STANDS AND IF THEY WERE TO OBTAIN PLANNING PERMISSION TO BUILD ON IT 
THE LAND AT THE MOMENT IS ONLY CLASSED AS RECREATIONAL LAND 
SO IT WOULD BE VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE TO FIFTY THOUSAND 
IF PLANNING CONSENT WAS PASSED THEN YOU COULD LOOK AT POSSIBLY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
THE FIGURES TO BE FAIR THE TWENTY FIVE TO FIFTY WITHOUT PLANNING SEEMS A BIT LOW OR QUITE LOW YES 
BUT THE FIGURE WITH PLANNING AT HALF A MILLION THAT SOUNDS MORE REALISTIC 
WHICH IS WHAT WE WERE BASING OURSELVES ON ANYWAY 
THE FUTURE FOR THE BUILDINGS AND LAND IS IN RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT 
I THINK IF PLANNING PERMISSION WAS OBTAINED FOR REDEVELOPMENT OF THE WHOLE SITE 
INCLUDING THE EXISTING BUILDINGS 
I THINK THE VALUE WOULD BE IN THE RANGE OF FIFTEEN MILLION POUNDS TO ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION POUNDS 
TO DEVELOP THE WHOLE SITE WITH A VALUATION OF FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN 
IS A GOOD VALUATION 
IT TOOK ME BY SURPRISE I DIDN'T THINK IT MIGHT BE WORTH THAT MUCH 
BUT THE POTENTIAL ALWAYS HAS BEEN IN THE WHOLE TWO ACRES 
BUT A TWO ACRE DEVELOPMENT WOULD MEAN DEMOLISHING THE BUILDINGS 
AND THAT COULD BE THE END OF THE SCHOOL AND THE PLAY CENTRE THE KIDS WON'T BE PLEASED 
THE BUILDINGS WILL BE HERE FOR THE NEAR FUTURE AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOW COMMITTED TO A FIVE YEAR LEASE 
WITH A POTENTIAL OF A FIVE YEAR RENEWAL 
HMM SO I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE A LONG TERM VIEW 
YEAH IN FIVE YEARS' OR POTENTIALLY TEN YEARS' TIME TO 
IF WE DEVELOP THE WHOLE TWO ACRE SITE 
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE ACTIVITY CENTRE IS SAFE 
AND ANY DEVELOPMENT TO THE LAND COULD PROVIDE A NEW INTAKE TO THE SCHOOL 
IT'S BEEN A GREAT LESSON FOR ANYONE STUDYING CAREER CHANGES 
IT'S REALLY NICE JUST TO BE WORKING FOR OURSELVES AND DOING THIS SORT OF THING 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC IT'S REALLY GOOD WE'RE GLAD WE'VE TAKEN THAT STEP 
WE ARE IT'S THE BEST THING WE'VE EVER DONE YEAH 
WHEN WE WERE LAST ON THIS INDUSTRIAL ESTATE IN ROCHESTER KENT 
BUSINESS PARTNERS SONNY AND STEVE HAD BOUGHT THE FREEHOLD OF THIS WAREHOUSE 
AND ITS FIRST FLOOR OFFICES FOR THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
THEY PAID A WHOPPING ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OVER THE GUIDE PRICE 
BUT THE INDUSTRIAL UNIT WAS IDEAL FOR THEM TO RELOCATE 
THEIR TWO SEPARATE BUSINESSES AND PUT THEM UNDER ONE ROOF 
THREE MONTHS ON WE'VE RETURNED TO CHECK ON PROGRESS 
OUTSIDE THE PILES OF PALLETS HAVE GONE 
AND NOW YOU GO THROUGH TO A GREY RECEPTION TO REACH THE WAREHOUSE 
THEY SAID WE WOULDN'T NEED HARD HATS WHEN WE CAME BACK 
WELL THEY'RE RIGHT IT LOOKS MORE LIKE THE WORK IS ON HOLD 
THE STEEL FRAMEWORK FOR THE MEZZANINE FLOOR HAS GONE IN 
PLUS A KITCHEN 
AT LEAST THE OFFICE ON THE FIRST FLOOR IS NOW UP AND RUNNING BUT PROGRESS HAS BEEN SLOW 
AS YOU CAN SEE WE'VE NOT PUSHED ON AS MUCH AS WE'D HAVE LIKED BUT WE HAVE GOT THE MEZZANINE FLOOR IN 
IT'S READY FOR THE SECOND FITS TO BE DONE AND FOR THE REST OF THE PARTITIONS TO GO UP 
WE'VE HAD THE DRAWINGS DONE FOR OUR LAYOUT AND IT'S READY TO GO 
ALTHOUGH STEVE HASN'T MOVED IN YET SONNY HAS ALREADY RELOCATED HIS OFFICE TO THE FIRST FLOOR 
THIS IS OUR OFFICE AREA TEMPORARILY VERY CRAMPED AT THE MOMENT 
THERE WILL BE A WALL THAT COMES 
A STUD PARTITION A WALL THAT GOES ALL THE WAY ACROSS HERE 
AND THAT'LL BE A SEPARATE OFFICE AND THEN THIS WILL BE A WAITING AREA 
SOFA MAYBE A WATER MACHINE YOU KNOW FOR A DRINK 
AND DOUBLE DOORS COMING THROUGH HERE INTO A LARGE OPEN PLAN OFFICE GOING ON TOP OF THE MEZZANINE 
ADDING THE OFFICE IS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE SIZE OF THE WAREHOUSE 
AND IT REDUCES THE HEIGHT OF THINGS THAT CAN BE STORED 
BUT THE EXTRA SPACE WILL ALLOW STEVE TO RELOCATE AND JOIN SONNY 
SO WITH THE MOVE ONLY HALF COMPLETE HAS THAT CAUSED ANY PROBLEMS IT'S FINE 
WE GET ON FINE WE STILL WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER 
EVEN THIS MORNING WE'RE GOING OVER DEALS 
I'LL POP OVER HERE MY OTHER PREMISES IS ONLY LITERALLY LESS THAN A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY 
SO IT'S WORKING FINE AS IT IS IT'S NOT A HINDRANCE 
IT'LL BE NICE WHEN WE'RE IN THE SAME PLACE 
EVERYTHING WILL BE A BIT MORE FLUID AND WORK QUICKER 
THEY PAID THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND AT AUCTION FOR THE INDUSTRIAL UNIT 
HOW HAS THE BUDGET COPED WITH ALL THE STEELWORK NEEDED FOR THE MEZZANINE FLOOR 
ORIGINALLY WE EXPECTED IT TO COST AROUND THIRTY THOUSAND 
BUT WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE IT DONE IN TEN BY USING RECYCLED STUFF 
YOU'LL SEE THERE'S SOME FLIGHT OF STAIRS BEING PUT IN 
THAT CAME OUT OF A CONTRACT JOB THAT WE WERE DOING 
THE KITCHEN THAT CAME OUT OF A YOUNG LADY'S KITCHEN 
WE PUT A NEW ONE IN THAT'LL DO FOR OUR WAREHOUSE KITCHEN SO I CAN MAKE A CUP OF TEA 
THE WORK HAS BEEN DONE BY STEVE AND SONNY'S OWN WORKFORCE 
BUT ONLY WHEN THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO DO OTHER CONSTRUCTION WORK FOR THE BUSINESS 
WITH LOTS OF OTHER NEW WORK ON THEIR BOOKS THE RELOCATION HAS TAKEN LONGER THAN EXPECTED 
THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED SQUARE METRES OF GROUND FLOOR ACCOMMODATION AND THIRTY SEVEN SQUARE METRES UPSTAIRS 
SO EVEN WHEN STEVE'S OFFICE RELOCATES AND JOINS SONNY'S STAFF 
THERE'LL STILL BE SPARE CAPACITY IN THE BUILDING AN OPPORTUNITY THAT'S ALREADY BEING EXPLOITED 
WE'VE LET HALF THE CAR PARK TO SOMEBODY AND THE SAME COMPANY 
WANT TO RENT SOME OF THE WAREHOUSE SPACE BRINGING ABOUT TEN THOUSAND IN PER ANNUM SO IT ALL HELPS 
SONNY COULD WELL NEED SOME OF THAT MONEY 
REMEMBER THE INDUSTRIAL ESTATE IS BUILT ON RECLAIMED MARSHLAND 
THE BUILDINGS ARE ROCK SOLID BUT THE SURROUNDING LAND HAS BEEN SINKING IN PLACES 
THE CAR PARK COULD GET A BIT WOBBLY 
TIME TO SEE HOW TWO LOCAL AGENTS WHO SPECIALISE IN COMMERCIAL PROPERTY 
RATE SONNY AND STEVE'S INVESTMENT 
IT'S AN INTERESTING WAREHOUSE THAT'S GOT POTENTIAL 
FOR VARIOUS DIFFERENT TYPES OF USE AND OCCUPATION 
TO MAKE IT WORK THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO COMPLETE IT 
THERE ARE REPAIRS TO BE CARRIED OUT THE FLANK WALL'S DAMAGED 
AND THERE'S SOME COSMETIC REPAIRS EXTERNALLY 
OTHER THAN THAT JUST DECORATION AND GETTING THINGS ORGANISED 
THE EXTENSION TO THE OFFICE COULD BE CONSIDERED AN ADVANTAGE 
OR IN SOME CASES IT'D PUT PEOPLE OFF BECAUSE THEY NEED THE FULL HEIGHT 
WITH MEZZANINE FLOORS IT DOES TEND TO LIMIT THE MARKET IN SOME WAYS BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE 
WANT THE HEIGHT FOR STORAGE OTHERS WANT THE OFFICES 
THERE WASN'T AN AWFUL LOT OF OFFICE SPACE IN THIS UNIT ORIGINALLY 
SO THIS WILL GIVE EXTRA SPACE 
I THINK THERE WOULD CERTAINLY BE DEMAND IN THE MARKET IF THEY WANTED TO LET THE PROPERTY 
AND IT'D PROBABLY COMMAND A RENTAL OF BETWEEN TWENTY FOUR TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PER ANNUM 
I THINK IF THEY WERE LOOKING TO LET IT OUT IF THEY PUT IT INTO GOOD CONDITION 
THEY'D BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE AROUND TWENTY THREE TO TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND PER ANNUM 
THAT'S ACTUALLY MORE I THOUGHT IT WAS TWENTY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR FINE 
WILL THAT TEMPT HIM TO MOVE AND TAKE A RENTAL INCOME 
NO NO I'M NOT MOVING UNTIL IT'S THIRTY I HAVE TO 
THIS IS FOR OUR BUSINESS SO THIS IS WHERE WE'LL STAY 
REMEMBER SONNY AND STEVE PAID THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND FOR THE INDUSTRIAL UNIT 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OVER THE GUIDE PRICE 
AFTER THE CHANGES THEY'VE MADE HOW MUCH COULD IT BE WORTH NOW 
IF THEY DECIDED TO SELL THE PROPERTY WITH THE OFFICES ALL COMPLETED 
THEY COULD BE LOOKING AT A PRICE OF AROUND THREE HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED TEN MAYBE A LITTLE MORE 
EVEN ONCE IT'S COMPLETED IT'D BE DIFFICULT TO PUT A VALUE ON IT 
OF MORE THAN ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SO STILL LESS THAN THEY PAID 
THE THREE HUNDRED FORTY THEY PAID FOR IT AT AUCTION LOOKS TO BE OUT OF REACH 
BUT SONNY WAS PREPARED TO PAY A LOT FOR A PROPERTY HE DESPERATELY WANTED 
I WAS LOOKING FOR A GOOD SIX MONTHS AND YOU TRY FINDING A PLACE LIKE THIS SO YOU KNOW THE VALUATION 
I KNOW I PAID OVER THE TOP BUT I HAD TO HAVE IT I'M NOT WORRIED WHAT THE VALUATION IS 
OBVIOUSLY WE OWN IT OUTRIGHT IT'S A FREEHOLD AND IT'S A CENTRE POINT FOR OUR BUSINESS 
WE WISH STEVE AND SONNY WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO BE HERE FOR THE LONG HAUL 
I CAN SEE MYSELF STILL BEING IN THIS PREMISES IN TEN FIFTEEN YEARS' TIME I DON'T WANT TO MOVE 
I'LL ALWAYS HAVE MY OFFICE HERE IT DON'T MATTER HOW BIG I GET
