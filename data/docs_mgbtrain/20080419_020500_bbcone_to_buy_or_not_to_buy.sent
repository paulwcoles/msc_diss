KRISTIAN IF I SAID LEICESTERSHIRE TO YOU WHICH IS WHERE WE ARE TODAY WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IT'S FAMOUS FOR 
I WOULD SAY HOLD ON LET ME THINK ABOUT IT LET ME HAVE A THINK 
I WOULD SAY IT'S FAMOUS FOR PORK PIES WALKERS CRISPS AND RED LEICESTER CHEESE YEAH 
IT'S A SUPER LIST BUT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SAY CANALS 
CANALS WHICH I GUESS IS WHY WE'RE HERE 
YES KRISTIAN COULD YOU EVER IMAGINE YOURSELF LIVING LIFE ON A CANAL BOAT 
I THINK LIFE WOULD BE TOO SLOW 
I LIKE THINGS MORE COSMOPOLITAN 
I CANNOT SEE A FRENCH PATISSERIE OR A FANCY BOUTIQUE FOR MILES 
THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE WE'RE NOT HUNTING FOR YOU 
WE'RE HUNTING FOR A COUPLE WHO WOULD LOVE TO LIVE LIFE ON A CANAL BOAT 
WHICH IS SPLENDID BECAUSE WE CAN FIND THEM THREE SUPERB PROPERTIES 
AND WE'LL EVEN GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO TEST DRIVE 
HE'S ACTUALLY MEANT TO SAY TRY BEFORE THEY BUY 
HE DIDN'T THINK DID HE NO 
MEET MARILYN AND BARRY A VERY GLAMOROUS COUPLE 
WHO LOVE THEIR CURRENT HOME BUT FANCY A BIT OF A CHANGE 
MARRIED FOR THIRTY ONE YEARS THEY ARE READY TO SLOW THINGS DOWN AFTER YEARS OF HARD WORK AND WHY NOT 
THEY WANT THEIR HOBBY OF NARROW BOATING TO BECOME THEIR LIFESTYLE 
AND FOR THIS REASON THEY WANT THEIR NEW HOME TO BE NEAR WATER 
DREAMS OF SITTING ATOP THEIR OWN NARROW BOAT ALONG THE RIVER SOAR ARE HOPEFULLY GOING TO BECOME A REALITY 
YOU WANT TO LIVE BY WATER 
YES THAT'S RIGHT WE'VE BEEN ON NARROW BOAT HOLIDAYS QUITE A LOT 
AND BARRY'S GOT TO A CERTAIN AGE WHERE HE'D LIKE ANOTHER INTEREST IN HIS LIFE 
A BIT LESS WORK WHAT A LOVELY WAY OF DESCRIBING IT 
A BIT LESS WORK AND A BIT MORE PLAY WHEN YOU GET TO FIFTY 
EXACTLY YEAH SO WE JUST HAD THIS THOUGHT PERHAPS WE'VE LIVED WHERE WE'VE LIVED FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
SO WE THOUGHT DIDN'T WE PERHAPS WE'D MOVE HOUSE NEAR TO WATER HAVE A BOAT 
A BOAT THAT YOU OWN OR A BOAT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BUY 
WHERE ARE WE STANDING WITH THE BOAT 
WE WANT TO BUY A BOAT YOU WANT TO BUY A BOAT SO WE CAN JUST POP OFF AT THE WEEKEND LONG WEEKEND AWAY 
SO YOU'RE WATER BABIES YOU'RE LURED IN BY THIS WHOLE GLIMMERING SHINING YES 
LIKE A HIPPOPOTAMUS 
I WASN'T GOING TO MAKE THAT REFERENCE THEY ARE VERY GOOD SWIMMERS 
THEY ARE THEY'RE LIKE SUBMARINES 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT YOU TWO BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO OTHER BOYS INVOLVED IN THIS 
YES WE'VE GOT THREE BOYS ONE LIVES IN LONDON BUT WE'VE STILL GOT TWO WITH US 
SO YES WE NEED TO ACCOMMODATE THEM 
SO THE HOUSE ITSELF THAT WE'VE GOT TO FIND THEREFORE NEEDS FOUR BEDROOMS 
FOUR BEDROOMS O. K. YEAH REALLY 
WOULD YOU ACCEPT ANYTHING LESS 
YES IF IT WAS THE RIGHT PLACE 
THE HOUSE ITSELF OLD NEW PERIOD 
WE DON'T MIND I DON'T THINK 
YOU DON'T LIKE ANYTHING TOO OLD 
ANYTHING TOO OLD OR TOO MUCH WORK TO DO IN IT 
WE WANT THINGS TO BE EASIER NOW YOU WANT TO ENJOY LIFE YES 
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT SOCIABLE 
IT'S GOT TO BE A SOCIABLE HOUSE 
THE AREA WE ARE BROADLY SPEAKING NEARISH TO LEICESTER AT THE MOMENT 
WHAT ARE WE TALKING WHERE'S YOUR AREA OBVIOUSLY NEAR 
WELL BETWEEN MARKET HARBOROUGH AND LOUGHBOROUGH 
MARKET HARBOROUGH AND LOUGHBOROUGH THAT SORT OF AREA YES 
RIGHT I AM NOW GOING TO ASK THAT AWFUL SLIGHTLY EMBARRASSING VERY UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTION DO IT 
SHALL I YEAH 
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT TO SPEND I DIDN'T EVEN SAY IT 
YES HOW MUCH HAVE YOU GOT TO SPEND 
RIGHT WE DON'T WANT TO GO ANY MORE REALLY THAN OUR HOUSE WHICH WOULD BE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND 
BUT WE COULD BULLY YOU UP 
IF IT WAS LIKE THE REAL DREAM DREAM PLACE THE PLACE THAT WE THOUGHT OH THIS IS WONDERFUL 
I'M ON THE EDGE OF THE SOFA HERE COME ON THEN WE'D GO TO 
ABOUT FOUR MAXIMUM 
ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY ALL RIGHT SHE SAYS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY 
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND I LOVE THIS 
YOU TWO ARE SO LOOSE WITH THE CASH IT'S EXCITING 
I'VE KEPT A BIT TO ONE SIDE O. K. 
O. K. SO THE BUDGET THEN REALISTICALLY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

NO NO LATER 
LATER FINE FAIR ENOUGH 
I THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO FIND YOU ONE MY PROPERTY TEAM ARE BRILLIANT I WILL SEE YOU SOON 
SEE YOU LATER ON O. K. 
O. K. BYE 
THAT WENT WELL DIDN'T IT 
WENT O. K. IT DIDN'T GO ON THEN 
EVERYTHING GOING WELL UP UNTIL THAT LAST QUESTION NOW THEY'RE FIGHTING 
THEY MIGHT NOT WANT TO BUY A HOUSE ANY MORE 
ED IT'S THOROUGH PROPERTY RESEARCH YOU UNDERSTAND 
I'M GOING TO BECOME RATTY AND EXPLORE THE JOYS OF THE WIND AND THE WILLOWS ALONG THE WATERWAYS 
AND WHY DON'T YOU DO WHAT YOU DO BEST O. K. PLAY TOAD 
HOP INTO A VINTAGE CAR AND TALK TO AN ESTATE AGENT 
THE RIVER SOAR MEANDERS THROUGH THE CENTRE OF LEICESTERSHIRE 
AND WAS ONCE THE MOST PROFITABLE COMMERCIAL NAVIGATION IN THE COUNTRY 
NOW IT REMAINS A TRANQUIL RIVER CONTINUING THE LINE OF THE GRAND UNION CANAL FOR NARROW BOATS BARGES 
AND RIVER CRUISERS TRAVELLING THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE COUNTRY 
BARRY AND MARILYN WANT TO JOIN THE OTHER SEVENTY THOUSAND BOAT OWNERS CRUISING ALONG THE U. K. WATERWAYS 
AND THIS IS A GREAT COUNTY TO BEGIN THEIR JOURNEY 
WHILE PROPERTIES IN LEICESTERSHIRE ARE STILL UNDER THE NATIONAL AVERAGE 
WATERSIDE PROPERTIES ATTRACT A HIGH PREMIUM 
FLATS AND HOUSES AT MODERN MARINAS LAKESIDES OR ON THE BANKS OF CANALS CAN ATTRACT FIFTEEN PER CENT MINUS TWENTY FIVE PER CENT EXTRA 
MAYBE THIS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY GRAND BUDGET WON'T STRETCH AS FAR AS WE THOUGHT 
SO LET'S LEAVE THE WATER AND SEE WHAT THIS BIG BUDGET CAN GET US ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY 
FIRST UP WE HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL HOME NEAR SAINT IVES IN CORNWALL 
IT HAS TWO BEDROOMS AND FABULOUS EXPOSED ROOF TRUSSES AND BEAMS 
AND SURROUNDED BY COUNTRYSIDE 
IT'S NO SURPRISE THIS PROPERTY HITS THE BUDGET AT 
OR THIS STUNNING FOUR BED COTTAGE IN NORTH WRAXALL WILTSHIRE 
IT'S A DETACHED PERIOD HOME WHICH HAS BEEN LOVINGLY RESTORED AND MODERNISED 
WITH A PRIVATE WALLED GARDEN AT THE BACK IT ALSO COSTS 
OR FINALLY HOW ABOUT THIS GRADE THE SECOND LISTED COTTAGE IN BISHOP'S CLEEVE CHELTENHAM 
IF BEAMS ARE YOUR THING THEN THIS HOUSE IS THE ONE 
COMPLETE WITH INGLENOOK FIREPLACE AND SURROUNDED BY WELL ESTABLISHED GARDENS 
THIS TOO COSTS 
NOW WILL YOU LOOK AT THIS THERE'S THE RIVER 
THERE'S THE BOAT AND MOORINGS AND OVER HERE IS THE PROPERTY 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD BE THE PERFECT PROPOSITION FOR MARILYN AND BARRY 
SO ALL I'VE GOT TO DO BECAUSE THERE'S LOTS OF PROPERTIES ALONG THE RIVER IS FIND ONE THAT'S FOR SALE 
THIS IS THE BUSIEST ESTATE AGENCY I'VE EVER BEEN INTO 
HELLO MY NAME'S ED YOU SUCKED ME IN WITH YOUR EYES 
HELLO THERE HELLO 
COULD YOU HELP ME THERE'S A PROPERTY YOU'VE GOT ON YOUR BOOKS THAT'S FOR SALE RIGHT BY THE RIVER 
YES THAT'S THE ONE HAVE YOU GOT A PRICE FOR THAT

OR POP THE MOTHER IN LAW IN THERE 
YOU CAN SEE THE RIVER WHICH I IMAGINE YOU'VE GOT IN YOUR PROPERTY KRISTIAN O. K. ALL RIGHT 
NOW NOT EXACTLY RIGHT ON THE RIVER 
I FOUND A GORGEOUS NEW BUILD IN THE STYLE OF SOMETHING OLDER 
AND CAN I JUST READ TO YOU THIS LITTLE BIT AT THE BACK 
SILEBY MILL BOATYARD IF YOU HAVE SOME SPARE TIME TO SPEND WHY NOT GET AWAY FOR A FEW HOURS 
A DAY OR EVEN MORE AND EXPERIENCE THE RELAXING DELIGHTS OF EXPLORING THE BEAUTIFUL RIVER SOUR 
I WANT TO GO THERE NOW 
YOU DON'T BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE WILD CARD 
THIS PROPERTY HERE FROM THE OUTSIDE MAY NOT LOOK LIKE THE MOST EXCITING BUNGALOW EVER 
IT LOOKED LOVELY FROM THE OUTSIDE 
BUT ON THE INSIDE 
SPACE AGO GO

THAT MIGHT JUST FLOAT THEIR BOATS

BUT IT'S LOVELY IN THERE COME ON BE FRIENDS 
I'VE GOT A WEIRD FEELING ABOUT THIS HOUSE KRISTIAN 
I FEEL IT'S LOVELY IT IS LOVELY IT'S BEAUTIFUL IT IS BEAUTIFUL 
SOMETHING ABOUT IT SAYS IT'S NOT MARILYN AND BARRY 
MAYBE THAT THERE'S NO RIVER NEARBY MAYBE THAT THERE'S A MAIN ROAD NEARBY MAYBE THAT IT'S MODERN 
HELLO LET'S LISTEN ALL RIGHT 
THAT'S NICE I LIKE THIS OPEN THE OPENNESS DO YOU YEAH 
WITH THE KITCHEN AND DINING PART 
I CAN VERY MUCH IMAGINE THEM OPENING THE DOORS GUESTS COMING IN SOME CANAPES SOME VERY LOVELY 
I THINK STRONG CLARETY WINE ON THE TABLE AND PEOPLE JUST HAVING A JOLLY GOOD TIME A JOLLY GOOD TIME 
I'M NOT TOO SURE I LIKE THAT CUPBOARD OVER THE SINK MARILYN 
THERE'S A FRIDGE AND A FREEZER THERE LOOK 
I'M NOT TOO SURE I LIKE THAT CUPBOARD OVER THE SINK YEAH IT'S A BIT IN THE WAY 
THEY ARE BEING VERY THOROUGH 
THEY'RE OPENING THE CUPBOARDS THEY'RE INSPECTING THE MICROWAVE NOTHING IS BEING OVERLOOKED 
THE OLDER YOU GET THE WISER YOU BECOME 
COME THROUGH THIS WAY BARRY LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THIS I CAN'T WAIT 
SMALL LOUNGE SMALL SMALL NOT WHAT WE'RE USED TO 
I THINK AFTER SEEING THAT NICE AND OPEN THIS FEELS A BIT SMALL 
RIGHT SMALL O. K. 
SMALL O. K. BUT STILL CRAMMED FULL OF CHARACTER AND POSSIBILITIES 
YOU WOULDN'T GET OUR FORTY ODD FRIENDS IN HERE WOULD YOU FOR CHRISTMAS 
THAT'S IT WE CAN'T 
I FEEL LIKE I'VE FALLEN AT THE VERY FIRST HURDLE THAT'S HOW I FEEL 
WELL YOU DO HAVE ANOTHER HURDLE UPSTAIRS THAT COULD HELP THEM MAKE THAT HURDLE NOT SEEM SO OMINOUS 
THAT'S A NICE SHAPE ISN'T IT YEAH 
LET'S LOOK IN THIS ONE FIRST 
OH ANOTHER SITTING ROOM 
STUDY 
THAT'S NICE ISN'T IT 
BE GOOD FOR AN OFFICE WOULDN'T IT 
YEAH YEAH AND THEN IF YOU'VE GOT LIKE A SOFA BED IT'S AN EXTRA ROOM ISN'T IT THAT YOU CAN USE 
I WOULD LIKE TO PROCLAIM HERE THAT THERE IS A VERY VERY HIGH FINISH AND STANDARD TO THIS PROPERTY FACT 
AH BATHROOM 
OH SMALL 
TILED SMALL 
SMALL 
VERY SMALL AND THE SHOWER WITH THE BATH I DON'T LIKE TOO MUCH 
YEAH 
I SUPPOSE IT'S ADEQUATE ISN'T IT 
YEAH 
I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT REALLY SHOULD I 
BUT THAT'S HOW I FEEL IT'S ADEQUATE 
YES IT'S AS GOOD AS ADEQUATE 
I DON'T LIKE THAT WORD 
I WANT THAT WORD TAKEN OUT AND REPLACED WITH THE WORD THIS IS BRILLIANT 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
LOOKS LIKE MASTER BEDROOM 
IS IT THE MASTER WE DON'T KNOW DO WE 
LOOKS LIKE IT WITH A DOUBLE BED IN SO YEAH 
MARILYN CLEVERLY SAID WE HAVEN'T SEEN ALL THE HOUSE YET YEAH 
SO MANY PEOPLE GET THAT WRONG NO FITTED WARDROBES 
THERE WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH WARDROBE SPACE FOR YOU NOT ENOUGH FOR ME NO 
BUT YOU COULD HAVE MORE WARDROBES COULDN'T YOU HERE NO 
THEN IT TAKES OFF THE SIZE DOESN'T IT 
NO IF YOU OPEN THE DOOR YOU'D BE OPENING IT ONTO THE WARDROBES 
OH THAT'S TRUE SO YOU COULDN'T USE THAT 
WELL THE VERY VERY SIMPLE VERY SIMPLE SOLUTION DOWNSIZE ON YOUR SHOES AND YOUR FROCKS 
NEXT ONE 
THAT WOULD BE LUKE'S BEDROOM PRESUMABLY 
DIFFERENT STYLE OF WARDROBE 
AGAIN I JUST FEEL IT'S SMALL 
I THINK YOU GET THAT FEELING ABOUT IT 
EVERYTHING'S A BIT TOO CLOSED IN 
O. K. SERIOUS NOW THAT'S THE SERIOUS HAND 
WHY ARE THEY NOT LIKING IT 
OH LOOK 
NOW THIS IS MORE LIKE IT YES THIS IS A SHOCK 
THIS IS MORE LIKE IT ISN'T IT 
THIS IS MUCH BETTER 
AH THIS IS QUITE SURPRISING BECAUSE WE WALKED IN THE KITCHEN 
AND REALLY LIKED THAT AND THEN SINCE THEN IT'S ONLY BEEN ADEQUATE 
YEAH 
BUT NOW THIS IS LOVELY I LOVE THIS 
WE SHOULD'VE RESERVED OUR JUDGEMENT FOR THE TOP OF THE SHOP 
THEY'VE COME ROUND TO IT A LITTLE BIT 
I TOLD YOU THEY'D LIKE IT WHEN THEY GOT TO THE TOP OF THE HOUSE 
IT JUST BUILDS CHAPTER BY CHAPTER 
IT REALLY DOES NOW THE BEDROOM 
SEE I LIKE THIS BEDROOM BETTER DON'T YOU YES THIS WOULD PROBABLY BE THE MASTER BEDROOM THEN 
YEAH YEAH THIS IS MORE LIKE IT 
IT'S NICER ALTOGETHER ISN'T IT 
I'VE GOT IT WHAT HAVE YOU GOT YOU'VE PICKED THIS HOUSE FOR YOURSELF 
NOT FOR THEM 
I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY LIVING HERE I KNOW YOU WOULD 
I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING SOMETHING ELSE I'M NOT ABSOLUTELY STRUCK ON IT NO 
BUT THERE ARE SOME NICE FEATURES 
AT THE START OF THIS HOUSE TOUR I WAS LIKE THIS 
NOW ABSOLUTELY BROKEN 
MAYBE WITH A CUNNING HINT AND TIP YOU COULD TURN IT ROUND 
I LIKE THE WAY YOU THINK O. K. 
O. K. GUYS 
I KNOW YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT UNSURE ABOUT THE HOUSE BUT THE REASON WHY 
THE METHOD IN MY MADNESS IS THAT IT'S SO CLOSE TO THIS FANTASTIC MARINA 
IT'S GORGEOUS HERE LOVELY AND IT'S RIGHT ON YOUR DOORSTEP 
WHAT FIVE TEN MINUTE WALK FROM THE FRONT DOOR 
THAT'S RIGHT 
AM I SELLING IT TO YOU HERE WE LIKE IT WE LIKE THIS BIT 
WE'RE STILL A BIT WORRIED ABOUT THE BEDROOMS IN THE HOUSE 
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT NICER TO ME I COULD JUST PUSH YOU ALL IN 
THAT'S AN OPTION I'M CONSIDERING HERE 
LET'S GO BACK TO THE HOUSE LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PRICE AND SEE WHAT THAT IS O. K. 
ABOUT TURN OFF WE GO I'M TRYING 
O. K. BARRY AND MARILYN YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED THE HOUSE YES 
FLOATING VOTERS ON WHETHER YOU LIKE IT I WOULD SAY YES 
ALL RIGHT WELL MAYBE WHEN YOU FIND OUT THE PRICE IT MIGHT MAKE YOU EITHER HATE IT OR LOVE IT MORE 
O. K. MARILYN LADIES FIRST YOUR MAXIMUM BUDGET IS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND YOUR GUESS IS 
O. K. 
BARRY I THINK IT'S A BIT MORE THAN THAT 
O. K. LOOKING TOWARDS ABOUT THIRTY THREE 
MAYBE THIRTY FOUR 
YOU'VE ALL BEEN QUITE UNPLEASANT TO ME THIS MORNING SO CAN I JUST SAY TO YOU 
CAN I JUST SAY HA HA 
WE'RE WRONG BECAUSE THE ACTUAL PRICE IS ONLY TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND OH 
O. K. NOW HOW THE TIDE TURNS EH 
SO FOR THAT YOU GET A LOVELY PROPERTY GREAT LOCATION AND VERY AFFORDABLE YEAH 
SHALL WE GO TO MY CHOICE 
PROPERTY TWO YES 
IT WOULD BE RUDE NOT TO DO YOU KNOW 
WHICH WAY IT IS IT'S THIS WAY THAT WAY 
SETTING SAIL FOR PROPERTY NUMBER TWO AND ONTO THE QUAINT BARROW UPON SOAR MARINA 
AGAIN A QUICK STROLL UP THE LANE WILL TAKE YOU TO THIS EXTENDED DETACHED HOME 
IN A FANTASTIC LOCATION 
THIS HOUSE ALSO HAS THE ADDED BONUS OF A SELF CONTAINED FLAT SHOULD THEY NEED ONE 
BARRY AND MARILYN WELCOME TO OCEAN HEIGHTS 
IF YOU SMELL YOU CAN SMELL THE CANAL 
IF YOU GO INTO THE BACK BEDROOM YOU CAN SEE THE CANAL OH RIGHT 
IT DOES COST A LOT TO LIVE NEAR THE CANAL THIS IS MY COMPROMISE YOU CAN SEE THE CANAL 
YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR BOAT AND WAVE 
YOU GET TO KEEP ALL OF YOUR SONS WITH THIS HOUSE 
THAT'S NICE GOOD OR BAD I DON'T KNOW 
ONE OF THEM COULD HAVE THEIR OWN SEPARATE WING 
QUITE LITERALLY THIS IS BEAUTIFUL 
OH OH RIGHT LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS IF YOU WERE WALKING UP NOW WHAT WOULD YOU SAY

THAT'S THE ONLY THING 
BARRY SOCK IT TO ME I THINK THIS IS A LITTLE MORE THAN THE OTHERS BECAUSE IT'S A NICE AREA 
A NICE QUIET CUL DE S. A. C. AREA 
BUNGALOWS ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN HOUSES ANYWAY AND I'M GOING FOR THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND MAXIMUM BUDGET IS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SO QUITE NEAR THE TOP MARILYN 
I THINK IT'S POSSIBLY A BIT MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE OF THE AREA 
SO I'M GOING TO GO FOR THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT KRISTIAN SOMEONE'S GOING TO LOOK VERY SCARED NOW BECAUSE I'LL KISS THE WINNER 
MWAH WELL DONE YOU

NOT THAT TRICKY WHY THEY'RE NOT REALLY GOING TO PICK YOURS ARE THEY 
IT'S ONLY TWO CHOICES MINE AND THE WILD CARD 
YOURS WAS MORE EXPENSIVE EVEN THOUGH THEY LIKE IT IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE OTHERS 
I'M ABSOLUTELY COMPLETELY CONFUSED 
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR A RECAP 
YES REMEMBER MY BEAUTIFUL NEW BUILD HOUSE WITH THREE FLOORS 
AND THE LOVELY BOAT YARD THAT WAS JUST DOWN THE ROAD 
I STAND BY MY WORD THAT HOUSE WAS LOVELY AND I STILL HAVEN'T FORGIVEN THEM 
FOR THEIR COMMENTS AND IT ONLY COST TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
YEAH BUT REMEMBER MY BRILLIANT HOUSE A STONE'S THROW FROM THE RIVER 
THAT HOUSE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BUILT FOR BARRYLYN 
IT HAS EVERYTHING THEY NEED 
AND IT WAS EVEN LESS THAN KRISTIAN'S HOUSE AT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
BUT DON'T FORGET THE WILD CARD 
A DORMER BUNGALOW WITH A REAL PARTY LOUNGE A STUNNING GARDEN 
AND THE CHANCE TO BUY A NARROW BOAT WITH MOORINGS JUST UP THE ROAD 
NO SURPRISE THEN THAT IT'S AT THE TOP OF THEIR BUDGET AT THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
SO BARRY AND MARILYN HERE WE ARE AT YOUR CHOSEN PROPERTY

WELL THE SPACE INSIDE I THINK YES NICE GARDEN 
O. K. NOW BEFORE WE LET YOU GO IN THERE AND DO THE TEST DRIVE 
INTERESTINGLY WE'VE HAD OUR TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY PROPERTY SURVEYOR 
GIVE THIS PROPERTY A ONCE OVER ED 
NOW BARRY I KNOW YOU KNOW YOUR HOUSES 
IF YOU LOOK ON THAT WALL I DIDN'T SPOT THIS 
THERE'S SPORADIC DRILL HOLES IN THERE WHICH IS EVIDENCE OF 
AIR VENTS I THINK 
CAVITY WALL INSULATION A GOOD THING 
THAT'S BEEN PUT INTO THE HOUSE SO IT'S NOW MORE HEAT AND ENERGY EFFICIENT 
ABSOLUTELY AND AL GORE WOULD PAT YOU ON THE BACK HE WOULD INDEED 
THEN THE SURVEYOR SAID KRISTIAN I SAID ANY PROBLEMS 
HE SAID THERE'S FLAT ROOFS I SAID RIGHT I SAW THEM WHAT'S THE PROBLEM THEY'RE FLAT 
I SAID WHAT ABOUT FLAT ROOFS HE SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS 
I ASKED WHAT HAPPENS AND HE SAID OVER TIME YOU'D HAVE TO MAINTAIN THE ROOFS 
I SAID YEAH BUT WHAT'S THE PROBLEM HE SAID THAT'S IT 
I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS A PROBLEM 
HE THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD TELL YOU YOU'VE GOT FLAT ROOFS THEY ARE NOTORIOUS 
YEAH BUT I ASKED HIM IF THOSE ONES WERE IN GOOD SHAPE AND HE SAID YES 
SO FOR ME NO REAL PROBLEM 
ENOUGH OF THIS GET IN THERE HAVE A LOOK AROUND AT PROPERTY AND PLEASE ENJOY YOURSELVES
