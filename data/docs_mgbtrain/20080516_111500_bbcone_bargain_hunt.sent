I HOPE YOU GET TO BUY SOME ARTISTIC ITEMS TODAY

A HAPPILY MARRIED COUPLE RUTH AND MERVYN WELCOME TO BARGAIN HUNT 
SO HOW DID YOU GUYS MEET RUTH 
A LONG TIME AGO A FELLOW ASKED ME OUT AND I WAS REALLY EXCITED 
BUT HE ONLY WANTED ME TO COOK FOR THE PARTY THE NEXT DAY 
I THOUGHT YOU'D SAY HE ONLY WANTED YOU FOR YOUR BODY NO I DID 
HE WANTED ME TO COOK THE SALMON I WENT BACK TO THE PARTY STINKING AND I WAS REALLY UPSET 
AND THIS GUY OFFERED ME A DRINK HE THOUGHT THIS IS FISHY BUSINESS I WANT TO GET INVOLVED HERE 
YOU'RE NOW A WRITER BUT IT DIDN'T START OUT THAT WAY THAT'S RIGHT 
AFTER THE BIRTH OF MY TWO CHILDREN I HAD SEVERE POST NATAL DEPRESSION AND ANYTHING TO OFFSET THAT 
SO I ENTERED COMPETITIONS AND THAT'S HOW I ENDED UP GETTING THE COOK OF THE REALM FOR WALES 
PEOPLE STARTED TO ASK ME TO COOK FOR THEM AND I EVENTUALLY WROTE A COOKERY BOOK 
AND HAD A LITTLE ANTIQUE SHOP 
WHAT HASN'T THIS WOMAN DONE I MADE LINGERIE LINGERIE ANTIQUES 
YES FISH AND FISH BUT YOU'RE A WRITER NOW AREN'T YOU 
VERY MUCH SO TELL US WHAT YOU'RE INTO 
I GOT A COOKERY BOOK PUBLISHED A LONG TIME AGO 
THEN I HAVE THE MEMOIR OF ME LOOKING AFTER MY LATE MOTHER WHO HAD ANOREXIA 
THAT'S CALLED REMEMBERING JUDITH 
RIGHT AND IT'S STILL GOING O. K. IS IT STILL SELLING STILL SELLING

WHILST THE GUIDING LIGHT FOR THE BLUES IS DAVID HARPER 
O. K. YOU GUYS WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND 
ON THE BOTTOM IT SEEMS TO HAVE SOME SORT OF SPECIAL TRADEMARK 
GRAYS POTTERY IS THAT A GOOD SIGN 
GRAYS POTTERY IS A VERY NINETEEN THIRTIES POTTERY 
FROM THE SHAPE AND THE COLOUR OF IT YOU CAN SEE IT'S VERY NINETEEN THIRTIES 
AND THE PATTERN IS CALLED SUNBUFF 
IT'S QUITE NICE YOU'VE GOT QUITE A LOT 
SIX CUPS SAUCERS AND PLATES AND THERE'S NO DAMAGE ON IT NO 
DO YOU LIKE IT NORMA I'M NOT A YELLOW PERSON 
GRAYS POTTERY STARTED AT THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
IN STOKE ON TRENT IN STAFFORDSHIRE WHERE MOST POTTERIES ARE BASED 
BUT THEY REALLY CAME TO PROMINENCE IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES AND THIRTIES 
WHEN THEY PRODUCED A LOT OF ART DECO CERAMICS AND EMPLOYED THE DESIGNER SUSIE COOPER 
I DON'T THINK THIS IS SUSIE COOPER DESIGN BUT IT IS NICELY MARKED 
IT'S QUITE A REASONABLE PROPOSITION THE KEY POINT IS HOW MUCH IS IT 
IT'S SIXTY YOU GET A LOT FOR YOUR MONEY 
YOU DO BUT I THINK WE'D GET A LOT MORE FOR OUR MONEY IF YOU SMILED AT THE DEALER AND GOT THAT PRICE DOWN 
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO CHAT TO THE DEALER AND GET IT DOWN FOR US 
IT HAS BEEN KNOWN SEE YOU LATER THANK YOU 
SHE'S A LADY 
PATRICIA TWINKLED THE PORCELAIN DOWN TO A SUNNY FORTY QUID 
MERV DAVID HELLO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS 
WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT IT I LOVE THE CARVING 
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL THE PATTERN AROUND THE WOOD IT JUST LOOKS A LOVELY PIECE OF FURNITURE 
I THINK YOU'VE GOT A GOOD EYE THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UP MY STREET 
GOOD PERIOD FURNITURE FABULOUS QUALITY ENGLISH 
DO YOU KNOW HOW EARLY IT IS NO I JUST LIKE THE LOOK OF IT 
LATE REGENCY WILLIAM THE FOURTH ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS AS OLD AS THAT IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL 
LOOK AT THE CARVING THERE MERVYN IT WAS SO POPULAR AT THAT TIME AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY 
THEN DOWN THE LOVELY TWISTED COLUMN SO PRECISE AND PERFECT 
AND DOWN TO THE THICK HEAVY DECORATION AT THE BOTTOM 
CAN YOU IMAGINE THESE SCONCES LIT ON A DIM NIGHT IN YOUR BEDROOM 
DON'T GET TOO EXCITED RUTH'S WITH YOU AS WELL I'M SPARKLING ALREADY 
BUT THE CANDLE BURNING CATCHING THAT AND GLISTENING AND SHINING WONDERFUL WONDERFUL 
WE LOVE IT WE LOVE IT THE BAD NEWS IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
A FEW YEARS AGO WOULD HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF POUNDS 
BUT BROWN FURNITURE EVEN LOVELY PIECES HAVE GONE OFF THE BOIL 
HOWEVER IT'S PRICE RELATIVE 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN A STEAL FIVE YEARS AGO 
BUT IT NEEDS TO BE NEGOTIATED TO MAKE SOME PROFIT 
WHO'S THE KEEN NEGOTIATOR OUT OF YOU TWO RUTH I'LL SEND HER IN 
REALLY YEAH MISS SPARKLY SHALL WE GO A MOROCCAN HAGGLER I AM COME ON COME AND DO YOUR BIT 
THE SWEETEST THINGS ARE THERE FOR YOU 
HELP YOURSELF TAKE A FEW 
THAT'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO 
RUTH SWUNG THE PRICE DOWN TO ONE HUNDRED TEN 
IF YOU WORK FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS IN THE WORKS AND YOU KEEP YOUR NOSE CLEAN AND YOU COME TO RETIRE 
YOU MIGHT EXPECT A NICE GOLD WATCH 
THAT WOULD BE IN ENGLAND IN WALES THEY PRESENT YOU WITH A NICE SOLID LUMP OF SLATE 
LOOK AT THESE TWO THIS ENCRIER A FAIRLY STANDARD TWO BOTTLE INKWELL 
IS MADE OF SOLID SLATE 
SOMETHING HAPPENED ON OCTOBER THE FOURTEENTH ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY 
AND IT HAPPENED TO JOHN JONES 
HE RETIRED AND THEY PRESENTED HIM WITH THIS SOLID SLATE INKWELL 
AND THEN AN AMAZING EVENT HAPPENED NINE YEARS LATER 
SEPTEMBER FOURTH ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
HIS MISSUS AMY JONES SHE RETIRED AND THEY GAVE HER A PRESENT 
THEY LOOK LIKE FUNERARY URNS BUT THEY'RE SOLID LUMPS OF SLATE 
VERY APPROPRIATE IN WALES BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF SLATE HERE 
MOST OF THE SLATED ROOFS IN BRITAIN ARE SLATES THAT HAVE COME FROM SNOWDONIA 
WHICH IS PROBABLY WHERE THESE TWO OBJECTS ORIGINATED FROM 
WHAT ARE THEY WORTH WELL THEY'RE ASKING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EACH 
IS THAT REASONABLE I DON'T KNOW BUT THEY'VE DONE BETTER I FANCY THAN AN OLD GOLD PLATED WATCH 
NORMA PATRICIA LOOK WHAT I'VE FOUND WHAT IS IT 
WELL APART FROM BEING A PLATE I LOOKED AT THE SCENE AND THOUGHT 
THERE'S NORMA IN YELLOW AND PATRICIA IN PEACH AND THERE'S ME PLAYING MY MANDOLIN 
CHARMING ISN'T IT AND VERY CUTE YOU ARE 
IT HAS BEEN SAID A DECORATIVE ITEM 
AND A PLATE WHEN WE LOOK ON THE BACK IT'S GOT MARKS FOR MEISSEN 
EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY HAND PAINTED 
WITH THIS RATHER NICE GILT BORDER 
IT'S A TYPICAL EIGHTEENTH CENTURY SCENE EVEN THOUGH IT'S TWO HUNDRED YEARS LATER 
THE NICE THING IS IT'S MARKED UP AT SIXTY AND I'VE HAD A QUIET WORD WITH THE DEALER 
SHE'S OFFERED IT TO US FOR FORTY FIVE SO IF YOU TWO LIKE IT I THINK WE OUGHT TO DO THE DEAL

TRYING TO FIND THE MAGIC 
TRYING TO WRITE A CLASSIC 
LOOK WHAT I'VE FOUND OH MERVYN RUTH'S GONNA LOVE THIS 
OH I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS 
SHE IS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS AND A NICE SIZE TOO ISN'T SHE 
BUT IT'S A SPELTER FIGURE I THINK I DON'T THINK IT'S BRONZE 
IT HAS BEEN GILTED AT SOME POINT YOU CAN SEE WHERE SHE WAS GOLD 
I THINK IT DOESN'T HARM AT ALL 
BECAUSE WHERE IT'S WORN IT EMPHASISES THE FACE SO BEAUTIFULLY 
SHE REMINDS ME A BIT OF A MODIGLIANI SCULPTURE OR PAINTING 
I THINK SHE'S LOVELY SHE REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING OUT OF FLASH GORDON 
MERVYN WE LIKE HER YOU LIKE HER 
ARE WE GONNA LIKE THE PRICE WELL SHE'S THIRTY EIGHT 
I'D PAY THAT TO BUY HER FOR OUR HOME BUT WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC 
AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE A PROFIT SO WHAT DO YOU FEEL 
WELL I FEEL THAT YOU NEED OR YOU NEED TO GO AND CHARM THEM 
I'LL HAVE TO DO MY HAGGLING IT'S DOWN TO YOU LET'S GO GOOD LUCK 
MERVYN KEPT HIS HEAD FOR ONLY TWENTY EIGHT 
COME ON AND JUMP TO THE BEAT JUMP 
COME CLOSER COME CLOSER AND LISTEN 
THE BEAT OF MY HEART KEEPS ON MISSING

IT'S FEMININE AND PRETTY I LIKE THAT ERA 
VERY CLASSICAL ISN'T IT YES CLASSICAL POSE 
WHAT WE'VE GOT IS A PORCELAIN FIGURE OF A LADY DRAPED IN THIS RATHER DIAPHANOUS GOWN 
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY EMBLEMATIC OF PEACE 
AS SHE'S JUST ABOUT TO RELEASE THE DOVE OF PEACE 
IT'S IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE IVORY 
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY WHAT WE CALL BLUSH IVORY A SIMULATED IVORY 
AND IF WE LOOK FOR THE MARK WE'LL FIND IT'S ROYAL WORCESTER 
WHAT SORT OF AGE DO YOU THINK IT IS 
I'D GUESS ABOUT NINETEEN TWENTY OR POSSIBLY NINETEEN TEN SOMEWHERE ROUND THERE 
WOULD IT BE ART DECO OR ART NOUVEAU IN STYLE 
NEITHER BUT THERE'S A VERY GOOD WAY OF DATING ROYAL WORCESTER 
IF YOU COUNT THE LITTLE DOTS EITHER SIDE AND THE DOTS UNDERNEATH 
AND ADD THEM TO THE YEAR ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY TWO YOU COME UP WITH THE DATE 
O. K. NOW I THINK THERE ARE TWENTY DOTS THERE 
SO TWENTY AND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY TWO IS 
NINETEEN TWELVE ABSOLUTELY AND THAT'S WHEN THE FIGURE WAS MADE 
I THINK IT'S QUITE NICE BUT WHAT WORRIES ME NORMA IS THE PRICE 
THE LADY IS ASKING ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE WHICH I THINK IS MAYBE A BIT OVER OUR IT IS A LITTLE BIT RICH ISN'T IT 
BUT IT'S A QUALITY ITEM AND YOU TWO ARE QUALITY BIRDS OF COURSE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE NEED TO GET THAT PRICE DOWN 
AND EVEN IF WE DON'T MAKE A PROFIT WE'LL HAVE A NICE QUALITY FIGURE 
SO YOU NEED TO NEGOTIATE ON THAT PRICE AND GOOD LUCK THANK YOU SEE YOU LATER 
THE WORCESTER LOVELY STRETCHED THE REDS TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY WOOF

I JUST HOPE I'VE FOUND SOMETHING THAT'LL CATCH YOUR EYE 
CARDIFF CASTLE WOULD BE HARD TO MISS IT'S ONE OF THE CITY'S MOST OBVIOUS LANDMARKS 
INDEED IT GAVE ITS NAME TO THE CITY CAER BEING THE EARLY WELSH WORD FOR FORTRESS 
THE CASTLE KEEP BEHIND ME WHICH IS MEDIEVAL IN ORIGIN IS PART OF THOSE ORIGINAL FORTIFICATIONS 
AND IT'S AMAZING THAT IT'S SURVIVED SO WELL TO THIS DAY 
IT SAW ITS FAIR SHARE OF ACTION 
INDEED A DARING KIDNAPPING PLOT 
AND ALSO THE IMPRISONMENT OF ROBERT DUKE OF NORMANDY BY HIS YOUNGER BROTHER HENRY I OF ENGLAND 
SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS LATER AND THE CASTLE WAS INHERITED BY THE THIRD MARQUESS OF BUTE 
AN INCREDIBLY WEALTHY MAN FASCINATED BY MEDIEVAL HISTORY 
AT THE SAME TIME AN ARCHITECTURAL MOVEMENT KNOWN AS THE GOTHIC REVIVAL WAS ALL THE RAGE 
THE MOVEMENT SOUGHT TO REVIVE ALL THINGS MEDIEVAL IN ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN 
ONE OF ITS LEADING EXPONENTS WAS A MAN CALLED WILLIAM BURGESS 
BUTE AND BURGESS MET IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE 
AND TWO YEARS LATER BURGESS WAS COMMISSIONED TO REDESIGN THE WHOLE CASTLE 
INSIDE LARGE ROOMS WERE CREATED OUT OF A SERIES OF SMALLER ONES 
AND THAT WAS WHAT BURGESS DID HERE IN THE LIBRARY 
HE TURNED THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ENTRANCE HALL AND DINING ROOM INTO ONE LARGE ROOM 
THE LIBRARY HAS AN APPROPRIATE THEME OF LITERATURE AND LEARNING 
WHICH REFLECTS THE INTELLECTUAL INTERESTS OF THE MARQUESS 
HE WAS A NOTED SCHOLAR AND HERALDIST 
THOSE INTERESTS ARE REFLECTED BY BURGESS IN HIS CARVINGS OF ROMAN RULERS AND WELSH PRINCES 
IN THE CORBELS RUNNING AROUND THE ROOM 
LORD BUTE AS HE WAS WHEN THIS ROOM WAS COMPLETED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE 
WAS A NOTED THEOLOGIAN AND LINGUIST 
HE SPOKE A STAGGERING TWENTY ONE LANGUAGES 
AND THE CARVED FIREPLACE BEHIND ME SHOWS THE ANCIENT ALPHABETS 
THESE INCLUDE ANCIENT GREEK AND ARAMAIC 
SPOKEN BY LORD BUTE AND REPUTED TO BE THE LANGUAGE OF JESUS 
THE WALL DECORATION INCLUDES THE NAMES OF THE GREAT AND THE GOOD OF LITERATURE 
LORD BUTE WAS NOT YOUR STANDARD OR AVERAGE ARISTOCRAT 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT HE CAUSED A SENSATION BY CONVERTING TO ROMAN CATHOLICISM 
HE SUPPORTED THE REINTRODUCTION OF A SEPARATE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT 
HE SUPPORTED WOMEN'S RIGHTS TO UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 
HE DIDN'T SHOOT HE DIDN'T HUNT HE DIDN'T FISH BUT HE DID SUPPORT THE ANTI VIVISECTION MOVEMENT 
HIS LOVE OF ANIMALS CAN BE SEEN IN DECORATION THROUGHOUT THE CASTLE 
BUT MOST PARTICULARLY IN THE LIBRARY ON THESE CARVED AND INLAID DETAILS ON THE BOOKCASES 
THEY'VE ALSO BEEN USED IN FUN AND MISCHIEF OVER A DOOR A CHAMELEON CHANGES COLOUR AS IT MOVES 
WHILST THE MONKEYS ABOVE ANOTHER PUZZLE OVER THE FRUITS OF KNOWLEDGE A DIRECT DIG AT DARWIN 
LORD BUTE AS A DEVOUT CATHOLIC DID NOT APPROVE OF DARWIN'S IDEA THAT HUMANS EVOLVED FROM APES 
HE BECAME A RELIGIOUS SCHOLAR OF SOME NOTE AND WAS ALSO AN AUTHOR IN HIS OWN RIGHT 
HIS ENTRY IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM CATALOGUE RUNS INTO SOME THIRTY ITEMS 
ACROSS SUCH DIVERSE TOPICS AS TOPOGRAPHY HERALDRY AND HYMNOLOGY 
HE WAS ALSO A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE SCOTTISH REVIEW 
APART FROM HIS OWN WORKS HE EDITED AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE WORKS OF MANY OTHERS 
HIS MAIN WORK WAS THE TRANSLATION OF THE ROMAN BREVIARY INTO ENGLISH WHICH TOOK HIM SOME TEN YEARS 
HE WAS ALSO THE SUBJECT OF A BOOK HIMSELF 
IT'S SAID THAT HIS EARLY LIFE INSPIRED BENJAMIN DISRAELI'S NOVEL LOTHAIR 
TALKING ABOUT INSPIRATION I WONDER IF OUR LOTS WILL INSPIRE ANY INTEREST OVER AT THE AUCTION 
TIME TO GET THE WIND IN OUR SAILS AND SALLY FORTH TO BRISTOL 
A MARITIME CITY ONCE A CENTRE OF PIRACY AND PRIVATEERS 
SO WHO WILL BE MAKING OFF WITH OUR LOOT TODAY

FORTY PAID THAT'S A VERY GOOD BUY 
NEXT UP IS THE MEISSEN CRIMPED EDGED PLATE 
WHICH IS NOT SO JOLLY REALLY IS IT

OBVIOUSLY VERY POPULAR WITH THE LADIES WE THOUGHT IT WAS CUTE

BACK TO BACK THEN YOU HAVE A BIT OF VIOLENCE WHEN THEY CRACK THE NUTS ALL RIGHT VERY NICE 
WHAT DID YOU PAY MARK ONLY FIFTY FIVE

YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE NOW FOR THE AUDIENCE AT HOME WE'LL SHOW IT TO THE AUCTIONEER 
HE LIKED THEM DO YOU LIKE THEM I THINK THEY'RE QUITE FUN REALLY 
PUNCH AND JUDY IS ALWAYS POPULAR 
BUT THEY'RE MADE OUT OF A LOW VALUE MATERIAL COPPER COATED CAST IRON 
OH RIGHT SO THIS IS CHEAP CAST IRON FAKED UP TO LOOK LIKE BRONZE 
WHAT ARE THEY WORTH I DON'T REALLY RATE THEM PROBABLY TEN TO FIFTEEN 
FOR THE NOVELTY FACTOR TEN TO FIFTEEN 
PAID FIFTY FIVE FROM THE OLD LEFTOVER LOLLY THAT'S A BIT PUNCHY I DON'T THINK THIS IS MUCH OF A BONUS BUY

THEY PROBABLY PAID TWICE AS MUCH AS WHAT IT'LL GET IN THE AUCTION 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE YEAH 
NOW THE SPELTER BUST THAT'S EXTREMELY STYLISH ISN'T IT

CHEAP IN HER DAY ANYWAY IT'S STYLISH VERY MUCH FROM A PERIOD

MINTONS WERE FORMED IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY THREE IF YOU TURN IT OVER AND LOOK AT THE MARK 
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY SO IT'S IN THE EARLY YEARS 
IT'S IN GREAT CONDITION IT IS VERY NICE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M NOT BOWLED OVER 
GOOD ONE 
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK IT'S GONNA MAKE AT AUCTION IT SHOULD MAKE THIRTY FORTY I THINK 
BUT IT'S A RISKY ONE LOVELY WE'LL HAVE A THINK 
O. K. YOU DON'T NEED TO DECIDE ABOUT THIS UNTIL AFTER THE SALE OF YOUR FIRST THREE ITEMS 
BUT LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS 
IT'S A NICE THING IT'S GOT THIS LOUIS SEIZE TYPE MARK TO THE BASE 
IT'S VERY REMINISCENT OF THE MINTON FACTORY 
WE LOOKED IT UP AND WE'VE GOT IT TO ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHT 
IT'S OF INCREDIBLE AGE AND INCREDIBLE VALUE 
AGE DOESN'T ALWAYS DETERMINE HIGH VALUE WE PUT IT DOWN AS BEST BID 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT COULD MAKE FIVE TEN MAYBE FIFTEEN 
FIVE TEN OR FIFTEEN IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A BONUS BUY 
HE PAID TWENTY FIVE TO HELP THEM OUT 
OH DEAR THAT'S TERRIBLE ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE

HIMSELF MUST EITHER HOLD OR DRIVE 
DON'T HANG BACK GET OUT THERE AND MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS AND YOU WILL THRIVE 
VERY SENSIBLE VICTORIAN MOTTOS 
IT'S GOT A CURIOUS BLUEISH GLAZE WHICH IS A TYPE OF PEARLWARE 
INCREDIBLY CHEAPLY MADE 
A SLIGHTLY BETTER EXAMPLE OF PEARLWARE IS THIS CHILD'S MUG 
THIS ONE DATES FROM AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY OR ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY AND HAS GOT AN INSCRIPTION 
BUT IT'S A PECULIAR INSCRIPTION AND SAYS THAT IS FOR MARTHA 
INSTEAD OF IT SAYING RATHER NICELY A GIFT FOR MARTHA THIS MUST HAVE COME FROM A STROPPY OLD GRANNY 
WHO WANTED TO MAKE QUITE SURE MARTHA HAD IT AND THAT IS WHY SHE PUT THAT IS FOR MARTHA 
THE PROBLEM WITH THE MUG IS IT HAS A CHIP A HAIRLINE CRACK AT THE TOP 
AND A FEW CHIPS AT THE FOOT RIM 
HERE THEY HAVE A SYSTEM WHICH SAYS BEST BID THEY DON'T PUT AN ESTIMATE ON LOWER VALUE ITEMS 
BASICALLY YOU CAN BID AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE FIVE NOTE IT COULD BE YOURS
