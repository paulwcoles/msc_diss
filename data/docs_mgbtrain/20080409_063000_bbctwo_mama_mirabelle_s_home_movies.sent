THANK YOU KAYLA BUT YOU MENTIONED ONE ANIMAL I'VE NEVER HEARD OF 
WHAT DID YOU CALL IT AN ECHIDNA 
YEAH UNUSUAL LOOKING CRITTER TOO BIG NOSE EATS BUGS 
I THINK I'VE GOT A PICTURE OF ONE SOMEWHERE HERE IN MY POUCH 
GOOD GIRL KYLIE 
THIS HERE IS WHAT AN ECHIDNA LOOKS LIKE 
WHAT AN INTERESTING ANIMAL 
DO YOU KNOW WHERE I MIGHT FIND ONE MAYBE THIS WILL HELP 
UNDER THE THING THAT'S OVER YOUR LIPS 
AND UNDER THE THING THAT'S BENEATH YOUR EYES 
THAT IS WHERE THE ECHIDNA LIES 
OOH A RIDDLE HOW MYSTERIOUS 
I HAD A LOVELY TIME MEETING THE KANGAROOS 
BUT NOW I HAD A PUZZLING RIDDLE TO SOLVE 
IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG BEFORE I MET A VERY UNUSUAL LOOKING FRIEND 
HELLO MATE G'DAY 
GOOD DAY TO YOU TOO MR. 
PERCY'S MY NAME HELLO PERCY 
I'M MAMA MIRABELLE YOU'RE NOT AN ECHIDNA ARE YOU 
OH MERCY NO I'M WHAT THEY CALL A DUCK BILLED PLATYPUS 
I'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO MY MATES 
WE PLATYPUSES LIVE ON LAND AND IN THE WATER 
AND WE'RE GREAT SWIMMERS 
IN FACT WE SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME IN THE WATER FORAGING FOR FOOD 
AND YEAH WE KNOW WE'RE FUNNY LOOKING 
BUT PLATYPUSES ARE VERY POPULAR I CAN SEE WHY 
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO KNOW WHERE I'D FIND AN ECHIDNA WOULD YOU 
I HAVEN'T SEEN ONE LATELY THEY HAVE LONG POINTY TOES 
AND LAY EGGS YOU CAN'T MISS THEM 
GOOD LUCK OOH LONG POINTY TOES LAY EGGS 
H. M. M. MORE GOOD CLUES THANK YOU PERCY 
I KEPT ON HIKING ACROSS AUSTRALIA TRYING TO SOLVE THAT RIDDLE 
BUT WHILE I SEARCHED FOR ANY SIGN OF AN ECHIDNA 
I MET MORE WONDERFUL AND UNUSUAL ANIMALS THAT I'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE 
THESE KOALAS LIVE IN FORESTS AND LOVE TO CLIMB 
THEY'VE TWO THUMBS ON EACH HAND WHICH MAKES IT EASIER 
TO GRIP THOSE BRANCHES GUESS WHAT 
THE ONLY THING THEY EVER EAT ARE EUCALYPTUS LEAVES 
THEY HARDLY EVER DRINK BECAUSE THE LEAVES 
CONTAIN ALL THE WATER THEY NEED 
I ALSO SAW RAINBOW LORIKEETS 
AN AUSTRALIAN PARROT WITH FEATHERS MORE COLOURFUL 
THAN A NEW BOX OF CRAYONS 
I MARCHED EVERYWHERE AND SAW A LOT 
BUT STILL NO ECHIDNAS 
FINALLY MY FEET BEGAN TO HURT FROM ALL THE WALKING 
SO I SAT DOWN TO REST MY SORE TOOTSIES 
AND ANOTHER NEW FRIEND SAT DOWN NEXT TO ME 
G'DAY MISS OH WHAT A LOVELY IDEA IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY 
I'VE BEEN SNOOPING AROUND AFTER ANTS AND TERMITES SINCE DAWN

ECHIDNAS WHAT UNUSUAL ANIMALS THEY ARE 
HARDLY ANYONE EVER SEES THEM BUT THEY LIVE ALL OVER AUSTRALIA 
ANYWHERE THAT ANTS AND TERMITES LIVE COS THAT'S WHAT THEY EAT 
WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS STICKING UP FROM THEIR BACK 
THOSE ARE SPINES ECHIDNAS LOOK A BIT LIKE A HEDGEHOG OR A PORCUPINE 
WITH ALL THOSE SPIKES 
YOU MIGHT THINK THEY LOOK SCARY BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY VERY SHY 
SOME PEOPLE CALL THEM SPINY ANTEATERS 
COS THEY USE THEIR LONG STICKY TONGUES TO CATCH THEIR FOOD 
WOW ECHIDNAS ARE AMAZING AND THOSE LONG SNOUTS 
ARE BOTH THEIR NOSE AND MOUTH THEY CAN SMELL AND TASTE WITH THEM 
BUT EVEN MORE AMAZINGLY ECHIDNAS AND PLATYPUSES TOO HAVE FUR 
AND NURSE THEIR BABIES LIKE ELEPHANTS OR ZEBRAS OR CHEETAHS
