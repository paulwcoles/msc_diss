ALL ROME WAS WILD WITH JOY 
JULIUS CAESAR HAVING CONQUERED HIS GREAT RIVAL POMPEY 
HAS RETURNED IN TRIUMPH THE RULER OF THE WORLD 
CAESAR 
SPEAK CAESAR IS TURN'D TO HEAR 
BEWARE THE IDES OF MARCH 
WHAT SAY'ST THOU TO ME NOW SPEAK ONCE AGAIN 
BEWARE THE IDES OF MARCH 
HA HE IS A DREAMER LET US LEAVE HIM 
PASS 
BRUTUS 
I HAVE NOT FROM YOUR EYES THAT GENTLENESS 
AND SHOW OF LOVE AS I WAS WONT TO HAVE 
POOR BRUTUS WITH HIMSELF AT WAR FORGETS THE SHOWS OF LOVE TO OTHER MEN 
WHAT MEANS THIS SHOUTING 
I DO FEAR THE PEOPLE CHOOSE CAESAR FOR THEIR KING 
AY DO YOU FEAR IT 
THEN MUST I THINK YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT SO 
I WOULD NOT CASSIUS 
YET I LOVE HIM WELL 
WHY MAN HE DOTH BESTRIDE THE NARROW WORLD 
LIKE A COLOSSUS AND WE PETTY MEN 
WALK UNDER HIS HUGE LEGS AND PEEP ABOUT 
TO FIND OURSELVES DISHONOURABLE GRAVES 
WHAT SHOULD BE IN THAT CAESAR WHY SHOULD THAT NAME BE SOUNDED MORE THAN YOURS 
CAESAR IS RETURNING 
ANTONIUS 
CAESAR 
LET ME HAVE MEN ABOUT ME THAT ARE FAT 
SLEEK HEADED MEN AND SUCH AS SLEEP O' NIGHTS 
YOND CASSIUS HAS A LEAN AND HUNGRY LOOK 
HE THINKS TOO MUCH SUCH MEN ARE DANGEROUS 
FEAR HIM NOT CAESAR HE'S NOT DANGEROUS 
HE IS A NOBLE ROMAN AND WELL GIVEN 
WOULD HE WERE FATTER 
CASCA TELL US WHAT HATH CHANCED TO DAY 
THAT CAESAR LOOKS SO SAD 
WHY THERE WAS A CROWN OFFERED HIM HE PUT IT BY BUT TO MY THINKING HE WOULD FAIN HAVE HAD IT 
WHO OFFERED HIM THE CROWN 
MARK ANTONY 
WHAT WAS THE SECOND NOISE FOR 
WHY FOR THAT TOO THEN HE PUT IT BY AGAIN 
BUT TO MY THINKING HE WAS VERY LOATH TO LAY HIS FINGERS OFF IT 
AS HE REFUSED IT THE RABBLEMENT HOOTED AND UTTERED SUCH A DEAL OF STINKING BREATH 
THAT IT HAD ALMOST CHOKED CAESAR FOR HE FELL DOWN AT IT 
TIS VERY LIKE HE HATH THE FALLING SICKNESS 
NO CAESAR HATH IT NOT BUT YOU AND I 
AND HONEST CASCA WE HAVE THE FALLING SICKNESS 
I KNOW NOT WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT FAREWELL BOTH 
TO MORROW IF YOU PLEASE TO SPEAK WITH ME 
COME HOME TO ME AND I WILL WAIT FOR YOU 
I WILL DO SO TILL THEN 
THINK OF THE WORLD 
WELL BRUTUS THOU ART NOBLE YET I SEE 
THY HONOURABLE METAL MAY BE WROUGHT 
FOR WHO SO FIRM THAT CANNOT BE SEDUCED 
WHO'S THERE A ROMAN 
CASCA BY YOUR VOICE 
CASSIUS WHAT NIGHT IS THIS WHOEVER KNEW THE HEAVENS MENACE SO 
THOSE THAT HAVE KNOWN THE EARTH SO FULL OF FAULTS 
THEY SAY THE SENATORS TOMORROW MEAN TO ESTABLISH CAESAR AS A KING 
I KNOW WHERE I WILL WEAR THIS DAGGER THEN 
CASSIUS FROM BONDAGE WILL DELIVER CASSIUS 
SO WILL I 
STAND CLOSE AWHILE 
TIS CINNA HE IS A FRIEND 
O. CASSIUS IF YOU COULD 
BUT WIN THE NOBLE BRUTUS TO OUR PARTY 
GOOD CINNA TAKE THIS PAPER AND THROW THIS IN AT HIS WINDOW 
THREE PARTS OF HIM IS OURS ALREADY AND THE MAN ENTIRE 
UPON THE NEXT ENCOUNTER YIELDS HIM OURS 
IT MUST BE BY HIS DEATH AND FOR MY PART 
I KNOW NO PERSONAL CAUSE TO SPURN AT HIM 
BUT FOR THE GENERAL HE WOULD BE CROWN'D 
HOW THAT MIGHT CHANGE HIS NATURE 
CROWN HIM THAT 
AND THEN I GRANT WE PUT A STING IN HIM 
THEREFORE THINK OF HIM AS A SERPENT'S EGG 
AND KILL HIM IN THE SHELL 
THE TAPER BURNETH IN YOUR CLOSET SIR 
SEARCHING THE WINDOW FOR A FLINT I FOUND THIS PAPER 
IS NOT TO MORROW BOY THE IDES OF MARCH 
SIR MARCH IS WASTED FIFTEEN DAYS 
GO TO THE GATE SOMEBODY KNOCKS 
BRUTUS THOU SLEEP'ST AWAKE AND SEE THYSELF SPEAK 
STRIKE REDRESS 
BETWEEN THE ACTING OF A DREADFUL THING 
AND THE FIRST MOTION ALL THE INTERIM IS LIKE A PHANTASMA OR A HIDEOUS DREAM 
GOOD MORROW BRUTUS 
KNOW I THESE MEN THAT COME ALONG WITH YOU 
YES EVERY MAN OF THEM 
GIVE ME YOUR HANDS ALL OVER ONE BY ONE 
SHALL NO MAN ELSE BE TOUCH'D BUT ONLY CAESAR 
DECIUS WELL URGED 
I THINK IT IS NOT MEET MARK ANTONY SO WELL BELOVED OF CAESAR 
SHOULD OUTLIVE CAESAR 
OUR COURSE WILL SEEM TOO BLOODY TO CUT THE HEAD OFF AND THEN HACK THE LIMBS 
LET US BE SACRIFICERS BUT NOT BUTCHERS CASSIUS 
AND FOR MARK ANTONY THINK NOT OF HIM 
YET I FEAR HIM LET HIM NOT DIE 
BUT IT IS DOUBTFUL YET WHETHER CAESAR WILL COME FORTH TO DAY OR NO 
FOR HE IS SUPERSTITIOUS GROWN OF LATE 
NEVER FEAR THAT I CAN O'ERSWAY HIM AND I WILL BRING HIM TO THE CAPITOL 
TIS TIME TO PART 
BRUTUS MY LORD 
WHEREFORE RISE YOU NOW 
DEAR MY LORD 
MAKE ME ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CAUSE OF GRIEF 
PORTIA I AM NOT WELL IN HEALTH AND THAT IS ALL 
NO MY BRUTUS 
YOU HAVE SOME SICK OFFENCE WITHIN YOUR MIND AND UPON MY KNEES I CHARM YOU 
BY ALL YOUR VOWS OF LOVE THAT YOU UNFOLD TO ME WHY YOU ARE HEAVY 
AND WHAT MEN TO NIGHT HAVE HAD RESORT TO YOU 
KNEEL NOT GENTLE PORTIA 
I SHOULD NOT NEED IF YOU WERE GENTLE BRUTUS 
DWELL I BUT IN THE SUBURBS OF YOUR GOOD PLEASURE IF IT BE NO MORE PORTIA IS BRUTUS' HARLOT 
NOT HIS WIFE 
YOU ARE MY TRUE AND HONOURABLE WIFE 
AND BY AND BY THY BOSOM SHALL PARTAKE THE SECRETS OF MY HEART 
WHAT MEAN YOU CAESAR 
YOU SHALL NOT STIR OUT OF YOUR HOUSE TO DAY 
CAESAR SHALL FORTH 
I NEVER STOOD ON CEREMONIES YET NOW THEY FRIGHT ME 
THERE IS ONE WITHIN RECOUNTS MOST HORRID SIGHTS 
THESE PREDICTIONS 
ARE TO THE WORLD IN GENERAL AS TO CAESAR 
WHEN BEGGARS DIE THERE ARE NO COMETS SEEN 
THE HEAVENS THEMSELVES BLAZE FORTH THE DEATH OF PRINCES 
COWARDS DIE MANY TIMES BEFORE THEIR DEATHS 
THE VALIANT NEVER TASTE OF DEATH BUT ONCE 
ALAS MY LORD 
YOUR WISDOM IS CONSUMED IN CONFIDENCE 
CALL IT MY FEAR 
THAT KEEPS YOU IN THE HOUSE AND NOT YOUR OWN 
FOR THY HUMOUR I WILL STAY AT HOME 
OH 
CAESAR ALL HAIL 
PERCIUS YOU ARE COME IN VERY HAPPY TIME TO BEAR MY GREETINGS TO THE SENATORS 
AND TELL THEM THAT I WILL NOT COME TO DAY 
MOST MIGHTY CAESAR LET ME KNOW SOME CAUSE 
THE CAUSE IS IN MY WILL 
I WILL NOT COME 
THAT IS ENOUGH TO SATISFY THE SENATE 
BUT BECAUSE I LOVE YOU I WILL LET YOU KNOW 
CALPURNIA HERE MY WIFE STAYS ME AT HOME 
SHE DREAMT TO NIGHT SHE SAW MY STATUA 
WHICH LIKE A FOUNTAIN WITH AN HUNDRED SPOUTS 
DID RUN PURE BLOOD AND MANY LUSTY ROMANS 
CAME SMILING AND DID BATHE THEIR HANDS IN IT 
THIS DREAM IS ALL AMISS INTERPRETED 
IT SIGNIFIES THAT FROM YOU GREAT ROME SHALL SUCK 
REVIVING BLOOD 
AH AND THIS WAY HAVE YOU WELL EXPOUNDED IT 
AND KNOW IT NOW THE SENATE HAVE CONCLUDED 
TO GIVE THIS DAY A CROWN TO MIGHTY CAESAR 
IF YOU SHALL SEND THEM WORD YOU WILL NOT COME 
THEIR MINDS MAY CHANGE 
HOW FOOLISH DO YOUR FEARS SEEM NOW CALPURNIA 
I WILL GO 
HAIL CAESAR 
THE IDES OF MARCH ARE COME AYE CAESAR 
BUT NOT GONE 
I WISH YOUR ENTERPRISE TO DAY MAY THRIVE 
I FEAR OUR PURPOSE IS DISCOVERED 
BRUTUS WHAT SHALL BE DONE 
CASSIUS BE CONSTANT 
POPILIUS LENA SPEAKS NOT OF OUR PURPOSES 
FOR LOOK HE SMILES AND CAESAR DOTH NOT CHANGE 
CASCA 
YOU ARE THE FIRST THAT REARS YOUR HAND 
MOST HIGH MOST MIGHTY OH CAESAR PARDON CAESAR CAESAR PARDON

AMBITION'S DEBT IS PAID 
THEN WALK WE FORTH EVEN TO THE MARKET PLACE 
LET'S ALL CRY PEACE FREEDOM AND LIBERTY 
WHERE IS MARK ANTONY 
WELCOME MARK ANTONY 
O. MIGHTY CAESAR DOST THOU LIE SO LOW 
I KNOW NOT GENTLEMAN WHAT YOU INTEND 
WHO ELSE MUST BE LET BLOOD 
IF I MYSELF THERE IS NO HOUR SO FIT AS CAESAR'S DEATH HOUR 
O. ANTONY BEG NOT YOUR DEATH OF US 
YOUR VOICE SHALL BE AS STRONG AS ANY MAN'S IN THE DISPOSING OF NEW DIGNITIES 
WE WILL DELIVER YOU THE CAUSE 
WHY I THAT DID LOVE CAESAR WHEN I STRUCK HIM 
HAVE THUS PROCEEDED 
I DOUBT NOT OF YOUR WISDOM 
AND AM MOREOVER SUITOR THAT I MAY PRODUCE HIS BODY TO THE MARKET PLACE 
AND IN THE PULPIT AS BECOMES A FRIEND 
SPEAK IN THE ORDER OF HIS FUNERAL 
I WILL MYSELF INTO THE PULPIT FIRST AND SHOW THE REASON OF OUR CAESAR'S DEATH 
I KNOW NOT WHAT MAY FALL I LIKE IT NOT 
ROMANS COUNTRYMEN AND LOVERS HEAR ME FOR MY CAUSE 
O. PARDON ME THOU BLEEDING PIECE OF EARTH 
THAT I AM MEEK AND GENTLE WITH THESE BUTCHERS 
WOE TO THE HAND THAT SHED THIS COSTLY BLOOD 
CRY HAVOC AND LET SLIP THE DOGS OF WAR 
AS CAESAR LOVED ME I WEEP FOR HIM 
AS HE WAS VALIANT I HONOUR HIM 
BUT AS HE WAS AMBITIOUS I SLEW HIM 
I HAVE THE SAME DAGGER FOR MYSELF 
WHEN IT SHALL PLEASE MY COUNTRY TO NEED MY DEATH 
LIVE BRUTUS BRUTUS LIVE 
BRING HIM WITH TRIUMPH HOME UNTO HIS HOUSE 
GIVE HIM A STATUE LET HIM BE CAESAR 
FRIENDS ROMANS COUNTRYMEN LEND ME YOUR EARS 
I COME TO BURY CAESAR NOT TO PRAISE HIM 
THE EVIL THAT MEN DO LIVES AFTER THEM 
THE GOOD IS OFT INTERRED WITH THEIR BONE 
SO LET BE WITH CAESAR 
HE WAS MY FRIEND FAITHFUL AND JUST TO ME 
BUT BRUTUS SAYS HE WAS AMBITIOUS AND BRUTUS IS AN HONOURABLE MEN 
WHEN THAT THE POOR HAVE CRIED CAESAR HATH WEPT 
AMBITION SHOULD BE MADE OF STERNER STUFF 
YET BRUTUS SAYS HE WAS AMBITIOUS 
YOU ALL DID SEE 
I THRICE PRESENTED HIM A KINGLY CROWN 
WHICH HE DID THRICE REFUSE WAS THIS AMBITION 
METHINKS THERE IS MUCH REASON IN HIS SAYINGS 
CAESAR HAS HAD GREAT WRONG 
YET BRUTUS SAYS HE WAS AMBITIOUS 
I FEAR THERE WILL A WORSE COME IN HIS PLACE 
AND BRUTUS IS AN HONOURABLE MAN 
THERE'S NOT A NOBLER MAN IN ROME THAN ANTONY 
IF YOU HAVE TEARS PREPARE TO SHED THEM NOW 
LOOK IN THIS PLACE RAN CASSIUS' DAGGER THROUGH 
SEE WHAT A RENT THE ENVIOUS CASCA

TRAITORS VILLAINS WE WILL BE REVENGED 
NOW LET IT WORK 
MISCHIEF THOU ART AFOOT TAKE THOU WHAT COURSE THOU WILT 
THE CONSPIRATORS FLED FROM THE FURY OF THE PEOPLE 
ANYONE AGAINST WHOM THERE WAS THE SMALLEST SUSPICION

THEY HAVE THEIR EXITS AND THEIR ENTRANCES 
AND ONE MAN IN HIS TIME PLAYS MANY PARTS 
HIS ACTS BEING SEVEN AGES AT FIRST THE INFANT 
AND THEN THE WHINING SCHOOL BOY 
AND THEN THE LOVER 
THEN A SOLDIER 
JEALOUS IN HONOUR SUDDEN AND QUICK IN QUARREL 
AND THEN THE JUSTICE 
THE SIXTH AGE SHIFTS 
INTO THE LEAN AND SLIPPER'D PANTALOON 
WITH SPECTACLES ON NOSE 
LAST SCENE OF ALL THAT ENDS THIS HISTORY 
IS SECOND CHILDISHNESS 
SANS TEETH SANS EYES SANS TASTE SANS EVERYTHING 
COME HITHER COME HITHER COME HI THER 
COME HITHER COME HITHER COME HITHER 
DUKE FREDERICK DISCOVERED HIS DAUGHTER'S FLIGHT WITH ROSALIND 
AND SUSPECTED THEY HAD FLED TOGETHER WITH ORLANDO 
IN A RAGE HE SENT FOR ORLANDO'S BROTHER OLIVER 
AND ORDERED HIM TO FIND ORLANDO OR RISK BANISHMENT HIMSELF

TOO LITTLE PAYMENT FOR SO GREAT A DEBT 
WHY THERE'S A WENCH 
COME ON AND KISS ME KATE 
TWAS I WON THE WAGER 
AND BEING A WINNER GOD GIVE YOU GOOD NIGHT 
SANDWICHES SOME MORE WINE 
WHAT ALL THE PLAYERS GONE 
OH AM I NOT ALONE 
OH I HAVE HAD THE BRAVEST DREAM 
I KNOW NOW HOW TO TAME A SHREW 
A PAIR OF STOCKS 
YOU ROGUE 
SO YOU'RE THINKING 
WHY DO I NEED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT THIS SAFETY STUFF ON THE INTERNET 
TRUE MOST OF US KNOW HOW TO SURF 
IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO HAVE FUN WITH COOL SITES AND GAMES 
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM THEN 
WELL SURFING THE NET CAN BRING YOU INTO CONTACT WITH SOME DODGY PEOPLE 
AND SOME VERY RISKY SITUATIONS 
THIS VIDEO TELLS YOU HOW TO KEEP YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU 
AND PROTECT YOURSELF ON LINE 
FOR STARTERS ONE OF THE MOST CRUCIAL THINGS 
IS PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY 
SO IF YOU'RE IN A CHAT ROOM SAY 
IT'S BEST TO KEEP THINGS LIKE REAL NAMES PHONE NUMBERS 
E. MAIL ADDRESSES OR PASSWORDS TO YOURSELF 
JUST LIKE YOU WOULD IN THE REAL WORLD 
WOULDN'T YOU 
O. K. THAT WAS A BIT OTT 
BUT LET'S FACE IT 
HOW WEIRD WOULD IT BE TO GIVE A TOTAL STRANGER IN THE STREET 
YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER OR ADDRESS 
WELL THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS 
WHEN YOU GIVE OUT INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF ON THE INTERNET 
YOU ARE BROADCASTING IT TO A WORLD FULL OF STRANGERS 
SO A NUMBER ONE TIP 
WELL I LIKE TO USE THE INTERNET BECAUSE I GET TO MEET NEW PEOPLE 
WHO LOVE FASHION AND LOVE MUSIC 
I GENERALLY JUST LIKE TO GO ON THE INTERNET TO CHAT TO MY FRIENDS 
SEE WHAT'S ON THE TRAINING MARKET 
AND MAYBE CHECK OUT SOME NEW TECHNOLOGY 
I MET THIS REALLY NICE GUY IN A CHAT ROOM THE OTHER DAY 
NOW HE WANTS TO TALK ON A ONE TO ONE 
WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT ISN'T IT 
M. M. M. IS IT COOL 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
YOU SEE JUST LIKE THE STREET OUTSIDE 
THE INTERNET IS A PUBLIC PLACE 
SO THE SAME RULES APPLY 
I MEAN YOU WOULDN'T GO OFF WITH A STRANGER ON YOUR OWN WOULD YOU 
IN THE REAL WORLD YOU CAN SEE WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO 
SO IF YOU MEET SOMEONE FOR THE FIRST TIME 
AND THEY TELL YOU THEY'RE FIFTEEN YEARS OLD 
YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF IF THEY'RE TELLING THE TRUTH 
YOU CAN SPOT THE FAKE 
ON THE NET IT'S ANOTHER MATTER 
PHONEY PEOPLE CAN HIDE BEHIND NICKNAMES 
AND EVEN PRETEND TO BE THE SAME AGE AS YOU 
SO IT'S UP TO YOU TO NOT GET TAKEN IN BY THEM 
BE VERY WARY 
SO PICTURE THIS 
YOU'VE JUST MET SOMEBODY REALLY NICE ON THE NET 
GREAT AND YOU THINK YOUR NEW MATE IS REALLY COOL 
WHAT NEXT 
CHECK THIS OUT 
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO TONIGHT 
YEAH SO AM I 
YOU GOING TO SPEAK TO THAT BOY YOU MET THE OTHER DAY 
I DUNNO I'VE GONE OFF HIM A BIT 
WHAT D'YOU MEAN YOU WAS CRAZY ABOUT HIM LAST WEEK 
WELL I'VE KIND OF MET SOMEONE ELSE 
REALLY YOU HAVEN'T MENTIONED IT 
HIS NAME'S DARREN HE'S FIFTEEN HE'S REALLY REALLY NICE LOOKING 
AND WE'VE GOT ALL THE SAME THINGS IN COMMON 
AND I'M GONNA MEET HIM TONIGHT HE SAID HE WANTS TO MEET ME 
WHAT'S HE LOOK LIKE 
HE'S GOT BROWN HAIR BROWN EYES DARK SKIN 
I'VE SEEN HIS PICTURE HE'S REALLY REALLY REALLY NICE 
YOU'VE ONLY SEEN A PICTURE YEAH 
SO HOW DID YOU MEET HIM 
IN THE CHAT ROOM 
YOU MET HIM ON THE NET 
YEAH AND YOU'VE ONLY SEEN A PICTURE 
YEAH YOU CAN'T IT'S TOO DANGEROUS 
HE WOULDN'T HURT ME I KNOW IT 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE HIM 
I'VE SEEN HIS PHOTO HAVEN'T I 
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT YOU DON'T KNOW HIM BUT 
HE WOULDN'T LIE TO ME I KNOW HIM WE GET ON WELL 
D'YOU WANNA BE MUGGED NO 
D'YOU WANNA BE RAPED NO 
D'YOU WANNA BE HURT NO 
WELL DON'T MEET HIM IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT 
WELL YOU COME WITH ME 
I'M NOT TAKING THAT CHANCE EITHER 
AND IF YOU GO I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING 
KELLY I'M SORRY 
ALL RIGHT THEN FINE 
LISTEN I'VE GOT AN IDEA 
TELL HIM TO MEET YOU AND YOUR MUM DOWNTOWN ON SATURDAY 
DO I HAVE TO YES YOU DO TEXT HIM NOW 
WITH MY MUM YES WITH YOUR MUM 
LISTEN I'M ONLY DOING IT FOR YOUR OWN GOOD 
I DON'T WANNA SEE YOU GET HURT THAT'S WHAT MATES ARE FOR 
I'M TRYING TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU YEAH BUT WITH MY MUM 
IT'LL BE SAFER WITH YOUR MUM AROUND 
WELL IS KELLY RIGHT 
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE HER 
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE KATY 
IT'S HIM WHAT'S HE GOT TO SAY 
HE SAID HE CAN'T MEET ME ON SATURDAY HE'S BUSY 
SEE TOLD YOU 
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK 
WHY DO YOU THINK HE CHANGED HIS MIND 
WAS HE REALLY TOO BUSY 
WAS HE REALLY WHO HE SAID HE WAS 
MEET PEOPLE AND CHAT ON THE NET BY ALL MEANS 
BUT YOU SHOULD NEVER AGREE TO MEET ANYONE YOU'VE ONLY MET ON LINE 
EVEN IF YOU THINK THEY'RE O. K. 
PAEDOPHILES ARE SERIOUSLY CLEVER 
AND THEY WILL SPEND MONTHS GAINING YOUR TRUST 
BEFORE ASKING TO MEET YOU 
SO BE SMART 
HEY I'VE JUST GOT A TEXT 
AND IT'S PRETTY NASTY ACTUALLY 
TROUBLE IS I DON'T KNOW WHO THE SENDER IS 
BUT I'VE GOT THEIR NUMBER SO 
OH HI WARREN YEAH DID YOU JUST SEND ME A TEXT 
YEAH IT WAS PRETTY RUDE ACTUALLY 
OH I SEE YOU SENT IT TO THE WRONG NUMBER DID YOU 
WELL MAKE SURE IT'S THE RIGHT NUMBER NEXT TIME ALL RIGHT 
SEE HOW EASY IT IS FOR PEOPLE TO SEND YOU DODGY MESSAGES 
OR STUFF YOU DON'T WANT 
THAT WAS A MISTAKE 
BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE USE TEXTING TO SEND OFFENSIVE MESSAGES 
OR TO BULLY OTHERS 
AND THEY CAN DO IT ON LINE AS WELL 
HI MY FRIENDS SEEMED TO LIKE ME 
BEFORE MY MUM BOUGHT ME SOME NEW CLOTHES 
STUFF I'VE WANTED FOR AGES 
AND NOW THEY HATE ME ANY SUGGESTIONS 
HAVE YOU ASKED THEM WHY THEY HATE YOU 
MAYBE THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT JEALOUS 
WELL ONE OF THEM LISA WAS A BIT MIFFED 
BUT WE TALKED IT OVER AND NOW SHE'S FINE 
SO YOUR PROBLEM IS 
MY OTHER MATE EMMA 
SHE'S NEVER INTERESTED IN FASHION 
BUT TONIGHT ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE HATES ME 
SHE'S BLOCKED ME ON M. S. N. 
AND SHE'S POSTING BITCHY MESSAGES AIMED AT ME ON NEOPETS 
SHE WON'T EVEN GIVE ME A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO HER 
IF THEY'RE YOUR FRIENDS IT SHOULDN'T MATTER WHAT YOU WEAR 
SO MAYBE THEY'RE NOT THE FRIENDS YOU THOUGHT THEY WERE 
EVEN BEST MATES FALL OUT SOMETIMES WE ALL KNOW THAT 
SOMETIMES THINGS CAN GET NASTY THAT'S LIFE 
BUT SENDING UNPLEASANT E. MAILS OR POSTING HORRIBLE MESSAGES 
ARE JUST A COUPLE OF WAYS OF BULLYING PURE AND SIMPLE 
AND SOMETIMES BULLYING CAN GO BEYOND THE CLASSROOM 
AND THE PLAYGROUND AND THE STREETS 
RIGHT INTO THE PRIVACY OF YOUR OWN BEDROOM OR MOBILE PHONE 
IF SOMEONE GETS HOLD OF YOUR E. MAIL ADDRESS OR MOBY 
THEY CAN SEND YOU DODGY ATTACHMENTS AND VIRUSES 
THAT CAN REALLY MESS UP YOUR HARD DRIVE 
SO IF YOU WANT TO AVOID BEING BULLIED ON LINE 
OR GETTING DODGY STUFF SENT TO YOU 
CAN I TRUST EVERYONE ON THE NET 
HOW DO I KNOW IF I'M USING A SAFE SITE 
WHO WILL HELP ME IF THINGS TURN NASTY AND I GET HARASSED 
WHOA THERE IT'S NOT ALL DOOM AND GLOOM YOU KNOW 
THERE ARE TONS OF GOOD WEBSITES AROUND 
WHERE YOU CAN SURF OR CHAT SAFELY 
YOU JUST NEED TO KNOW WHERE TO LOOK 
I'M AN ASSISTANT PRODUCER ON THE B. B. C.'S WEBSITE FOR TEENAGERS 
SO I COMMISSION CONTENT AND WRITE CONTENT 
AND I'M ALSO HOST ON THE MESSAGE BOARD 
THE WEBSITE IS FOR BOYS AND GIRLS ROUGHLY AGED TWELVE TO SIXTEEN ISH 
IT'S GOT ENTERTAINMENT AND HOROSCOPES AND COMPETITIONS 
THERE'S THE HOROSCOPES REAL LIFE STORIES PROBLEM PAGES 
THAT KIND OF THING AND THEN ALSO OF COURSE THE MESSAGE BOARDS 
EVERY MESSAGE IS PRE MODERATED 
WHICH MEANS THERE'S A TEAM OF MODERATORS 
WHO READ EVERY SINGLE MESSAGE THAT ANYONE TRIES TO POST 
AND IF IT'S GOT ANYTHING OFFENSIVE IN IT 
OR WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WHO ISN'T REALLY A TEENAGER 
THEN THEY WON'T ALLOW IT ON THE BOARDS 
SO EVERY MESSAGE YOU SEE HAS BEEN CHECKED 
AND THERE'S ALSO A FILTER 
SO ANY MESSAGE THAT HAS A RECOGNISABLE SWEAR WORD IN 
ANY KIND OF ABUSE IN IT 
WILL AUTOMATICALLY GET REJECTED BY THE SYSTEM 
WHEN YOU REGISTER TO USE THE MESSAGE BOARDS 
THE ONLY PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT IT ASKS FOR 
IS YOUR FIRST NAME AND YOUR LAST NAME AND YOUR E. MAIL ADDRESS 
NONE OF WHICH WILL APPEAR ON THE SITE 
OR BE PASSED ON TO ANYONE ELSE 
IT'S SO THAT WE KNOW YOU ARE WHO YOU SAY YOU ARE 
THE NAME THAT APPEARS IS ONE THAT YOU CHOOSE 
IT'S YOUR SCREEN NAME ANY NAME YOU WANT 
BUT DON'T USE YOUR REAL NAME 
MOST WEBSITES ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE THESE SAFETY FEATURES 
ON THE B. B. C.'S TEENS WEBSITE 
IF THERE'S ANY MESSAGE YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE WITH 
THEN YOU CAN ALERT A MODERATOR 
THERE'S A BUTTON AT THE END OF EVERY MESSAGE WHICH YOU CAN CLICK ON 
THEN IT COMES UP IT SAYS IT'S FOR COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS MESSAGE 
THAT IT'S OBSCENE ABUSIVE THREATENING 
HARMFUL OR RACIALLY OFFENSIVE OR OTHERWISE OBJECTIONABLE 
YOU JUST WRITE A SUMMARY OF YOUR COMPLAINT 
WRITE YOUR COMPLAINT IN DETAIL 
CLICK ON SEND SOMEONE WILL READ IT AND GET BACK TO YOU 
WE'VE HAD PROBLEMS WITH PEOPLE TRYING TO POST RUDE MESSAGES 
BEING HORRIBLE TO SOMEONE ON THE BOARD 
OR EVEN THAT WE THINK THEY'RE NOT A TEENAGER AT ALL 
IN THAT CASE WE'VE HAD TO WARN THEM 
IF THEY CONTINUE THEN WE CAN BAN THEM 
THERE'S A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WE'VE HAD TO BAN BUT IT'S FAIRLY RARE 
BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE OTHER SITES OUT THERE IN CYBERSPACE 
WELL THERE ARE PLENTY OF COOL SAFE AND FRIENDLY ONES 
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO BE CLUED UP WHEN YOU USE THEM 
AND WHERE YOU CAN 
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT SETTING UP YOUR OWN WEBSITE 
WELL OLI WATTS DID 
HI I'M OLI WATTS 
I'M EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD AND I RUN A WEBSITE CALLED PUPILINENET 
PUPILINE IS INTENDED TO GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO HAVE A VOICE ON ISSUES THAT MATTER TO THEM 
IT STARTED AS A RESULT OF BULLYING I RECEIVED 
WHICH MEANT I HAD TO LEAVE MY FIRST SECONDARY SCHOOL 
I MOVED TO A NEW SECONDARY SCHOOL 
AND DECIDED I WANTED TO GIVE OTHER PEOPLE A CHANCE 
TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES THAT HAD HURT THEM JUST AS THINGS HAD HURT ME 
IT'S GROWN IMMENSELY AND COVERS ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT ISSUES 
FROM SEX AND DRUGS ALL KINDS OF THINGS 
THE BEAUTY OF THE INTERNET IS IT LETS YOU COMMUNICATE WITH ANYBODY 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A QUALIFIED JOURNALIST 
OR KNOW HOW TO FORMAT THINGS FOR A NEWSPAPER 
YOU CAN JUST SEND AN E. MAIL OR SEND ANYTHING 
AND WE CAN PLACE IT ON LINE 
THE WEBSITE'S AIMED AT PEOPLE AGED BETWEEN ELEVEN AND SEVENTEEN 
AND ANYONE FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD 
IT'S REALLY THE IDEA THAT ANY TEENAGER WHO HAS AN ISSUE 
CAN COME AND TALK TO US 
THE DIFFERENT THING ABOUT PUPILINE 
IS THAT IT'S RUN ENTIRELY BY YOUNG PEOPLE 
A LOT OF ON LINE WEBSITES AIMED AT YOUNG PEOPLE 
ARE WRITTEN BY JOURNALISTS 
THE PEOPLE WHO WRITE THE CONTENT ARE STUDENTS AND ARE YOUNG PEOPLE 
SO THE CONTENT IS FRESH IT'S UP TO DATE 
IT'S NOT BY SOMEONE PRETENDING TO KNOW WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE THINKING 
IT'S WRITTEN BY PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING IT AND THAT MAKES IT VERY POWERFUL 
I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER 
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING ON THE INTERNET 
OR WHEREVER WHETHER IT'S THE INTERNET OR PRINTED 
IS TO WORK OUT WHERE IT'S COME FROM AND WHO IT'S WRITTEN BY 
IF YOU'RE READING AN ARTICLE TALKING ABOUT SELF HARM 
BULLYING OR SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES 
YOU WANT TO KNOW THE INFORMATION HAS COME FROM A REPUTABLE SOURCE 
BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS ABOUT THE WEBSITE'S VALIDITY 
WHETHER OR NOT THE INFORMATION IS CORRECT 
HAVE A BROWSE AROUND MOST WEBSITES HAVE AN ABOUT US SECTION 
HAVE A LOOK AT THAT IT WILL EXPLAIN WHAT THE ORGANISATION IS 
WHETHER THEY'RE A COMPANY OR AN ORGANISATION OR A CHARITY 
THERE'S ALSO LIKELY TO BE A WEBMASTER'S E. MAIL ADDRESS 
SO E. MAIL THEM FOR ADVICE AND SUPPORT 
THE BEST THING TO DO IS ALWAYS TO TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS 
AND IF SOMETHING DOESN'T SOUND OR FEEL RIGHT 
THEN TAKE A LOOK AND SEE IF YOU CAN CHECK TO SEE WHAT THE BACKGROUND IS 
YOU SEE IT'S LIKE I SAID THE INTERNET IS A GREAT PLACE 
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE NET SAVVY 
STAY SMART AND STAY SAFE 
HAPPY SURFING
