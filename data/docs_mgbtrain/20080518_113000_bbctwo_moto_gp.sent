DIFFERENT WINNERS IN AS MANY RACES 
THE SEASON HAS BEEN FULL OF 
HEADLINES WORLD CHAMPION CASEY 
STONER SET THE BENCHMARK UNDER 
FLOODLIGHTS IN QATAR WITH ALWYN 
WHILE BRITAIN'S JAMES TASER TOOK 
FIFTH IN A TERRIFIC START JAMES 
TOSELAND LORENZO ANSWER BACK IN 
PORTUGAL IN CHINA VALENTINO ROSSI 
SAW A RETURN TO FORM WITH HIS FIRST 
WENT SO SHE SWITCHED TO BRIDGESTONE 
TYRES SO FOUR RACES AND DIFFERENT 
WINNERS AND BOTH TYRE COMPANIES 
MAKING IT A COMPETITIVE START 
THOSE RESULTS LEAVE THE TABLE 
LOOKING LIKE THIS LOOKING LIKE 
THIS 
WELL IT IS THE RATHER WINDY SUNNY 
QUEENIE GREY INDECISIVE DAY IN 
FRANCE AS WE REACH ONE OF THE 
CRUCIAL AND BUSY PART OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP THE FRENCH GRAND PRIX 
IS THE FIRST OF SEVEN RACES IN NINE 
WEEKEND BEFORE WE REACH GERMANY FOR 
THE SUMMER BREAK WHICH THE BOYS 
ARE GOING TO NEED THAT IS WHERE WE 
GET A GOOD INDICATION OF WHO COULD 
BECOME WORLD CHAMPION LET'S BE 
HONEST IT IS THIS PART THAT IS FUN 
THE FINDING OUT ROUND FIVE IS HOSTED 
BY LE MANS THE STOP START DUCATI 
CIRCUIT COULDN'T BE MORE DIFFERENT 
TO LAST ROUND IN SHANGHAI THIS 
TRACK IT'S ALL ABOUT AGILITY AND 
BRAKING THE WEATHER TENDS TO BE 
VERY CHANGEABLE AND CAN PLAY HAVOC 
WITH THE RESULTS COMING UP BEFORE 
THE RACE OF HIS VICTORY IN CHINA 
IS VALENTINO OFF THE SLOW BOAT AND 
BACK IN FORM MATT EXAMINES THE 
EVIDENCE WITH LORENZO'S HIGH SIDE 
FROM CHINA IN MIND WE LOOK AT 
TECHNICAL CLOTHING AND STAY WITH 
US AFTER THE RACE AS WE REMAIN ON 
B. B. C. TWO FOR MORE ANALYSIS AND 
FOOTAGE FROM BRITAIN'S CENTENARY 
ALL THAT TO COME THE RACE IS IN 
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES IF YOU WATCHED 
THE RACE LAST TIME VALENTINO ROSSI 
SHOWED US EXACTLY WHAT HE COULD DO 
MATT CAUGHT UP WITH HIM TO FIND OUT 
HIS THOUGHTS ON THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
VALENTINO AFTER THE WIN IN CHINA 
AND A GOOD START TO THE SEASON IS 
YOUR OLD MAGIC BACK OR DID IT NEVER 
GO AWAY 
NO SO WE HAD A DIFFICULT 
PERIOD ESPECIALLY LAST YEAR 
BECAUSE WE HAD SOME DIFFICULTIES 
WITH THE BIKE AND THE TYRES 
THEREFORE IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME 
FOR SURE BUT WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE 
THE RESULT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT IT 
WAS A VERY IMPORTANT VICTORY IN 
CHINA BECAUSE IT MAKES THE 
DECISION OF CHANGING TYRES SO WE 
HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE WE ARE GOING 
FASTER WITH BRIDGESTONE L. AM HAPPY 
BECAUSE IT WAS A GREAT RACE L. KNOW 
THAT ANYWAY THE CHAMPIONSHIP IS 
LONG AND DIFFICULT WE HAVE GREAT 
DRIVERS BUT I THINK WE ARE IN THE 
GAME 
WE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE GAME TYRES AND THE BIKE VALENTINO OF 
COURSE WHEN HE TAKES ON THE 
CHALLENGE HE REALLY GET ON WITH 
THE JOB L. THINK THIS BRIDGESTONE 
CHALLENGE HAS BEEN JUST WHAT THE 
DOCTOR ORDERED 
FOUR RACES FOUR 
WINNERS IT LOOKS AS IF IT WILL BE 
A FOUR HORSE RACE DO YOU AGREE 
FOR SURE THERE ARE LOT OF 
TALENTS IT IS DIFFICULT ALL THE 
RIDERS ALL THESE FOUR RIDERS TO 
BEAT THEM IT IS COMING TO BE A 
FUNNY CHAMPIONSHIP 
IT IS A VERY 
EARLY STAGE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE A 
LOT OF OPINIONS EARLY IN THE SEASON 
WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AS THE SEASON 
GETS TO THE HALFWAY POINT AND SEE 
WHO IS GOING TO BE COMING OUT IN 
FRONT 
FOUR WINNERS FOUR RACES IT FRONT LOOKS LIKE AN OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP WE 
WILL TRY TO KEEP OUR RHYTHM FOR THE 
NEXT RACES BUT OF COURSE THIS ONE 
IS VERY IMPORTANT WE WILL TRY TO 
IMPROVE 
WITHOUT QUESTION I CAN'T IMPROVE SEE ANY OTHER RIDER OTHER THAN THE 
FOUR THAT WE MENTIONED WHICH IS 
LORENZO CASEY STONER AND VALENTINO 
I CAN'T SEE ANYONE ELSE IN A NORMAL 
RACE THAT IS GOING TO GET ANYWHERE 
NEAR THOSE GUYS 
I'M JOINED BY CHARLIE AND STEVE IS 
THERE ANY SUCH THING AS AN ORDINARY 
MOTOGP RAISED 
NOT THIS YEAR FOUR 
DIFFERENT WINNERS IN FORMER 
CREDITOR AT RACES THIS IS 
SENSATIONAL 
IT HAS BEEN ASKED AN SENSATIONAL EXTRAORDINARY START WHY IS IT 
DIFFERENT FROM LAST YEAR EVERYBODY EVERYBODY HAS CAUGHT UP WITH CASEY STONER HE 
DOMINATED LAST YEAR EVERYBODY HAD 
WORKED HARD IF YOU NEVER GET A 
NORMAL RACE AT LE MANS COLIN 
EDWARDS FROM A POOR POSITION TO 
LAST 
GOING BACK TO VALENTINO ROSSI LAST A GOOD WIN FOR HIM IN CHINA LOTS 
OF RUMOURS WERE STARTING ABOUT HIM 
MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICE WITH THE 
BRIDGESTONE TYRES WHAT DO YOU 
RECKON 
I RECKON AFTER WATCHING RECKON COLIN EDWARDS GETTING READY FOR 
TODAY'S RACE IF I WAS VALENTINO I 
WOULD WANT TO BE ON MICHELINS 
BRIDGESTONE ARE GOOD TYRES AROUND A 
FAST CIRCUIT LIKE CHINA L. DON'T 
KNOW IF THEY ARE WHAT I WOULD HAVE 
HERE 
DO YOU STILL STICK WITH THE HERE FACT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE SWITCHED 
QUESTION OF I'D DO 
VALENTINO ROSSI 
COULD HAVE BEEN AS FAST AS COLIN 
HE CAN COME PUT CONVERT POLL 
POSITIONS TO RACE WINS 
TALKING OF 
MICHELIN DANI PEDROSA IS 
PHENOMENAL HE IS A DIFFERENT GUY 
TO LAST YEAR HE COULD WIN THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP BY PLAYING A CLEVER 
GAME 
A CLEVER GAME WINNING RACES GAME HE HAS MANAGED ONE OF THOSE HE IS 
A PERCENTAGE PLAYER IF HE IS NOT 
WINNING HE IS THEIR OR THEIR ABOUT 
HE IS PLAYING SMART 
THERE OR 
THEREABOUTS 
CASEY STONER IS NOT THEREABOUTS HAPPY BECAUSE HE IS NOT HAVING IT 
HIS OWN WAY PEOPLE HAVE CAUGHT UP 
HIS TYRES ARE NOT WORKING BIKES 
NOT WORKING BUT EVERYBODY IS THE 
SECOND ALSO FASTER 
ON THE DANI 
PEDROSA POINT YOU HAVE SAID BEFORE 
AT LEAST HE HAS LEARNED HOW TO 
BREAK LATE AND RIGHT IN THE RAIN BYKER LATE AND RIDE IN THE RAIN FOR 
ONE THING WE DIDN'T MENTION WAS 
GORGEOUS JORGE LORENZO THIS IS WHY 
EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT HIM 
LAST TIME DURING PRACTICE IN 
SHANGHAI GEORGE TOOK THIS HIGH 
SIDE WATCH FOR THE ANGLE AS HE 
LANDS THAT IS FRACTURED HE 
STILL MANAGED TO FINISH FOURTH ON HIS 
RETURN TO BARCELONA HE DISCOVERED 
HE HAD FRACTURED BOTH HIS ANKLES 
THAT MAKES THIS WEEKEND'S CRASH 
EVEN MORE EXCRUCIATING CAN YOU 
IMAGINE THE PAIN DURING QUALIFYING 
YESTERDAY HE HAD ANOTHER MISHAP 
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT IS TURNING 
OUT TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO WRITE 
KEEPING HIS FEET ON THE PEGS IS 
TRICKY ENOUGH TO RIDE 
WE HAVE 
TO BE HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS 
G. P. WE SHOULDN'T LOSE A LOT OF 
POINTS AND WE HOPE TO FINISH HE HE IS A BRAVE LITTLE SOLDIER MATTHEW 
ROBERTS IS IN THE PIT LANE HOW IS 
HE FEELING IT IS NOT JUST HIS 
ANKLES HE HAS BEEN ENDURING WELL WELL NO HE WAS QUITE LUCKY THIS WEEKEND 
HE HAS BEEN ENDURING HE WAS 
LUCKY NOT TO HURT HIS ANKLES MORE 
ENDURING AFTER TWO DAYS RIDING A 
ROUT AND NOT BEING ABLE TO USE HIS 
ANKLES AS HE WOULD NORMALLY DO IT 
HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL ON HIS ARMS AND 
SOLD TO DUST SHOULDERS HE WOKE UP 
WITH THE REEK SORT SHOULDERS L. 
GUESS THAT ADRENALIN WILL COME INTO 
IT REALLY SORE SHOULDERS L. 
THINK WE CAN GO ALONG WITH 
VALENTINO ROSSI'S OPINION THERE THERE ARE SOME FANTASTIC NAMES IN THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
RACE FOUGHT BRADLEY SMITH 
IT WAS 
BRILLIANT HE HAD A NIGHTMARE START 
HE FOUGHT HIS WAY UP FROM NINETEENTH THE 
RAIN CAME HE CAME THROUGH TO TAKE 
SECOND BEST EVER CAREER FINISH WE 
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HIS FIRST WIN 
BUT NEVER MIND THAT WILL COME SOON 
ENOUGH A CAREER BEST FOUR BRADLEY 
SUPERB WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO 
BRADLEY AFTER THE MOTOGP WE WILL 
CATCH 
GET HIS THOUGHTS ON 
THAT PODIUM FINISH WE GET ASKED A 
LOT OF QUESTIONS AS WHEN THE BOYS 
COME OFF HOW DO THEY MANAGED TO 
GET UP AND WALK AWAY IT IS DOWN TO 
AMAZING LETTERS BOOTS AND HELMETS 
AS THE CLOTHES GET MORE TECHNICAL 
STEVE HAS GONE TO INVESTIGATE 
AMAZING LEATHERS 
BEING MOTOGP RIDER IS A PRETTY 
COOL WAY OF MAKING LIVING BUT IT 
CAN HURT 
AT THIS TECHNOLOGY CENTRE AT THE 
FACTORY BASED IN ITALY A NEW FORM 
OF A WIDER PROTECTION IS IN 
DEVELOPMENT AND BEING READIED FOR 
ITS MOTOGP DEBUT IT IS DESIGNED TO 
PROTECT MOST EXPOSED PARTS OF THE 
RIDER SHOULDERS COLLARBONES AND 
NECK TO CREATE AHEAD TO FOOT 
SAFETY SYSTEM THIS ED BAIRD SYSTEM 
IS AT EXTERNAL POUCH WHICH SITS 
OVER THE SHOULDERS A LOT OF THE 
WORKINGS OF INSIDE THIS HUMP IT IS 
BULKY BUT IT DOES THE JOB HAVE 
ALESSANDRA THE PROJECT LEADER 
WHEN DID THIS START 
WE STARTED 
WORKING ON HIS RACING SOLUTION IN 
TWO THOUSAND FOR ONCE WE CONTINUED 
ACQUIRING THE ELECTRONICS AND 
DEVELOPING IT TO DETECT THE FALL OF 
THE RIDER 
IT MUST BE DIFFICULT TO 
MAKE OPERATE WITHOUT THE RIDER IF 
THE RIDER DOESN'T FALL OFF HOW DO 
YOU DEFINE WHERE THE BAG GOES OFF 
DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF FOUR THE 
ELECTRONICS DECIDE IF IT IS 
DANGEROUS OR NOT AT HER CRITICAL 
COULD BE THE IMPACT HE BASHED THE 
TYPE OF FALL 
THE TYPE OF BALL 
HOW DOES THIS WORK 
WHENEVER THE 
ELECTRONIC FIRES THE SYSTEM THE 
GAS INSIDE INFLATE THE BAG IT IS 
CALIBRATED STITCHING 
YOU MUST BE 
PLEASED WITH THE WAY THE SYSTEM 
WORKED IN VALENCIA IT DID A GREAT 
JOB 
WE ARE QUITE SATISFIED IT WAS JOB OUR FIRST ATTEMPT IT WAS QUITE 
CRITICAL WE HOPE THERE IS A 
POSSIBILITY TO PROVE THE SYSTEM WE 
ARE READY TO START THE JOB AFTER AFTER YEARS OF RESEARCH AND TRIALS IT 
WOULD APPEAR THE AIRBAG MAY BECOME 
A REALITY SOON IN MOTOGP SOMETHING 
THE TEAM HERE THINK THEY ARE CLOSE 
TO ACHIEVING 
THE BEGINNING WILL BE 
WITH WHAT WE HAD IN VALENCIA 
DURING THE SEASON HOPEFULLY WE CAN 
GIVE THIS SYSTEM BY THE END TO 
VALENTINO ROSSI 
BUT WHAT DOES 
VALENTINO THINK 
I THINK THEY GET 
THE SYSTEM PRETTY WELL SOME RIDERS 
HAVE HAD GREAT SUCCESS 
IT LOOKS 
LIKE THEY ARE QUITE READY TO TRY IT 
WITH MOTOGP L. THINK DURING THIS 
SEASON IN SOME TESTS WE WILL USE 
THE NEW AIRBAG SO THE SAFETY IS 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IF YOU 
IMPROVE THE SAFETY I AM HAPPY 
YES SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT A NICE 
CROWD HERE AT LE MANS WERE STOPPED 
LOT OF SUPPORT FOR VALENTINO ROSSI 
LIVE PICTURES ARE OF VALENTINO 
ROSSI ON THE GRID HE QUALIFIED ON 
THE SECOND ROW IN FOURTH PLACE 
HERE IS HOW EVERYBODY ELSE LINED UP HE DRAGS THE BIKE ACROSS THE LINE 
PROVISIONAL POLE GREAT STUFF 
CASEY STONER TRYING SO HARD LOOK 
AT THIS IN PRACTICE HE SHOULD HAVE 
CRASHED AT THAT DUCATI BUT HE 
REFUSED TO HAVE THE ACCIDENT AND 
THE DRIVE IT THROUGH THE CORNER 
COLIN EDWARDS FASTEST IN SO MANY 
SESSIONS ACROSS THE WEEKEND BUT SOMEBODY BEAT HIM DANI PEDROSA 
ON THE HONDA FINALLY DOES THE JOB 
AND PAID THE POLL COLIN WAS GIVEN 
TO TRY AND GET BACK IS GOING TO 
DRIVE NO ROOM FOR COLIN EDWARDS 
FULL STAFF BY MARCO MELANDRI HE 
WAS FORCED OFF LORIS CAPIROSSI 
ALMOST GOT TAKEN OUT 
IT WAS AN AMAZING WHEN HERE LAST 
YEAR YOU HAVE BEEN SOUNDING A BIT 
FRUSTRATED WITH SUZUKI THIS WEEK 
IT HAS BEEN GOOD THIS WEEKEND WE 
HAD A SLOW START THIS SEASON A 
REALLY BAD RESULT IN CHINA NO ZERO 
A SMALL MECHANICAL FAILURE WHICH 
HAS SUCKED BUT THE BIKE HAS BEEN 
GETTING BETTER 
HOW DO YOU FEEL 
ABOUT THE SET UP FOR THE RACE WE WE WILL WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE WEATHER 
DOES BUT WE ARE COMPLETELY DRY 
THE BIKEY SAID IT HARD IT FEELS 
FASTER WE WILL SEE WHAT IT DOES 
IF IT DOES RAIN PEOPLE KNOW THAT 
YOU OPERATE IN THE WET 
I DO NOT 
LIKE IT BUT YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR 
BEST 
DID YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE BEST THIS MORNING 
BUT DRY 
DE SO FAR 
SO GOOD ON THE THIRD ROW THAT IS 
HIS OLD TEAM MATE JOHN HOPKINS 
LET'S GO TO THE MAN HEADING OFF THE 
THIRD ROW JAMES TOSELAND ARE YOU 
O. K. TO SPEAK 
YES NOT TOO BAD A 
GOOD QUALIFYING SESSION JUST 
GETTING QUICKER AND QUICKER TO BE 
PUT OFF THE SECOND ROW WAS 
DISAPPOINTING BUT WE CAN DO WITH 
THEM IT SHOULD BE PRETTY GOOD FOR 
US TO THE LAYOUT IS NOT THAT 
COMPLICATED BUT IT IS VERY 
TECHNICAL NOT AS MUCH AS CHINA 
YOU CAN SEE HOW CLOSE EVERYBODY IS 
ON THE GRID L. WAS THE REPORT NINE 
OF THIS MORNING AND I WAS THIRTEEN I 
WAS OH NINE OFF 
LET'S GRAB HIS TEAM MANAGER 
CRASHING INTO EVERYBODY OVER THERE 
AND IT HAS BEEN A GOOD WE CAN SO 
FAR COLIN IS ON THE FRONT ROW 
JAMES HAS DONE A GOOD JOB HAVING 
TO LEARN THE TRACK 
SURE FOR JAMES 
THIS IS THE TOUGHEST TIME OF THIS 
SEASON A LOT OF TRACKS HE DOES 
NOT KNOW PEOPLE DO NOT REALISE HOW 
TOUGH IT IS THE MISSION TO LEARN 
THE TRACK AND TO PREPARE THE BIKE 
SO BUT FOR THE RACE IT HAS DONE A 
REALLY GOOD JOB HE IS VERY FOCUSED 
AND I AM QUITE SURE HE CAN DO A 
STRONGER RACE 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH 
THE SAID THAT EVEN A FAN 
YES THE 
MAIN POINT IS KEEP THE WEATHER 
DRY 
YOU CAN NEVER TELL HERE AND DRY COLIN IS ON THE FRONT ROW 
EVERYBODY IS PRAYING HE CAN TURN 
ONE OF THESE QUALIFYING POSITIONS 
IN TO A RESULT 
HE KNOWS THAT FOR 
HIM IT IS A BIT HEAVY BECAUSE 
EVERYBODY KEEPS ASKING HIM HOW CAN 
YOU PERFORM SO WELL IN QUALIFYING 
AND NOTHING IS HAPPENING IN THE 
RACE HE TOLD ME BEFORE THE RACE I 
WILL WIN THE RACE CROSS YOUR 
FINGERS AND IF THAT HAPPENS 
WILL ASK THE QUESTION 
NOBODY WILL ASK THE QUESTION ANYMORE 
NOBODY PUTS MORE PRESSURE ANYMORE ON HIM THAN YOU L. WILL RUN UP AND 
TRY TO FIND AND I WILL SEE IF I 
COULD HAVE A WORD WITH COMMENT 
COLIN HOW IS IT GOING WHAT YOU 
WHAT YOU HAVE THIS BIG LAND A 
I HAVE BEEN 
SPEAKING TO YOUR TEAM MANAGER AND 
HE IS WITH THE WEEKEND SO FAR 
HER WHY YOU FEELING ABOUT MARCO 
MELANDRI THIS MORNING HOW ARE 
YOU FEELING 
HE IS THE FURTHEST 
THING FROM MY MIND IT IS RACE TIME 
TIME TO DROP THE HAMMAN 
WHAT I DO 
THINKING ABOUT 
JUST DOING SOME 
LAPS BRICK MARKET THAT KIND OF 
STUFF 
WE WISH YOU LUCK LET'S GO STUFF BACK LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE 
SECOND ROW OF THE GRID HEADED BY 
THIS MAN VALENTINO ROSSI HE IS 
OFF AND LOOKING GOOD IN CHINA BUT 
THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT TRACK 
LET'S GRAB A QUICK WORD WITH HIS 
TEAM MANAGER 
A BIT OF A PROBLEM WITH THE FRONT 
OF THE BIKE THIS WEEKEND THE SOFT 
PLAYERS TOO SOFT THE HARD POSE TOO 
HARD 
WE HAVE GONE WITHOUT THE HARD STRONG ONES THE TEMPERATURES OF UP 
THAT AFTERNOON WITH THE STRONG 
ONES 
THE WIN IN CHINA HOW CRUCIAL ONES WAS THE TIMING OF THAT REGARDING 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
A VERY NECESSARY 
WHEN WE WENT THERE WE KNEW WE HAD 
TO WIN AT LEAST TWO OF THE NEXT 
THREE OR FOUR RACES AND STAY IN 
TOUCH WE ARE NINE POINTS OFF THE 
LEAD NOW IT WILL BE A GREAT RACE 
TODAY AND ITALY IN A FORTNIGHT IS 
VERY IMPORTANT 
THAT HAS ALWAYS AN 
AMAZING GRACE THAT IS ALWAYS AN 
AMAZING RACE AND WAS NOT QUITE DANI 
PEDROSA CLEAR OFF 
I HOPE NOT THE 
PLAYERS UP WORKED IMMEDIATELY AND 
HIS TOOK A BIT LONGER TO COME IN 
SO THE FIRST TWO LAPS WILL BE 
CRITICAL 
SO HE WILL TRY TO GET AN CRITICAL LEAD OF US AND START ABSOLUTELY 
LET ONE GO DOWN THE SECOND ROW 
LET'S WONDER AMAZING THIS GUY 
YOU CANNOT GET IN ENOUGH OF 
GEORGE LORENZO PAUL HAY LORENZO 
THERE HE IS COME ON THE SECOND ROW 
WATCH HIM GO THERE HE IS UP ON 
THE SECOND ROW NICKY HAYDEN 
QUALIFIED IN SIXTH PLACE AGAINST 
ALL SORTS OF RUMOURS HE HAS TO 
WRITE BETTER ALL SORTS OF RUMOURS 
THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE IN THAT SEAT 
FOR TOO MUCH LONGER IF HE 
NOT 
GET RESULTS FOLLOW ME 
IS THE REIGNING 
WORLD CHAMPION CASEY STONER IN 
THIRD PLACE NOT HAVING IT ALL HIS 
OWN WAY SO FAR THIS YEAR THE 
BRIDGESTONE PLAYERS ARE GETTING UP 
TO TEMPERATURE QUICKER THAN THE 
MICHELIN TYRES PERHAPS LOOK FOR A 
WHOLE SHOT FROM EITHER OF THOSE TWO 
WE SPOKE TO COLIN EDWARDS EARLIER 
HE WAS ON THE POLL LAST YEAR AND 
DID NOT GET RESULT AND IT REALLY 
FELL APART FOR HIM WE ARE ALL 
DESPERATELY HOPING HE CAN GET A 
TERRIFIC RESULT HERE DON'T FORGET 
IS HIS MICHELIN'S HOME RACE IN 
FRANCE SO THE FRENCH CROWD WERE 
LIKE THAT THE MANNER IN POLE 
POSITION SUPERB RIDER DANI 
PEDROSA LEADING THE STANDINGS BY 
SEVEN POINTS AND HEADING OFF THE 
TOP OF THE WORLD SO LET'S HAVE A 
LOOK AT THE AT HOW THE LAP AND 
THAT WITH VALENTINO ROSSI LOOK AT THIS WE ACCELERATE UP INTO 
SIX THE DEER THEN TIPPETT INTO 
THE CORNER FOR THE FIRST OF THE 
CHICANES IT IS REALLY HARD ON THE 
FRONT END OF THE BIKE SACRIFICING 
A BIT THERE FLICKING IT RIGHT FOR 
US THAT ACCELERATING SECOND THIRD 
GEAR ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREE CORNER QUITE BUMPY 
LUCIENNE LISTEN FOR THE TRACTION 
CONTROL WE ARE COMING INTO NEWS 
THIS IS LONG LEFT HANDER MUSEE 
UP TO THIRD GEAR BEFORE IT IS ALL 
THE WAY BACK DOWN RIGHT INTO FIRST 
GEAR GARAGE THERE NEW PART OF THE CIRCUIT GARAGE VET FIFTH GEAR AT THIS POINT BEFORE IT 
IS AGAIN VERY HARD ON THE BRAKES 
COMING THROUGH CHEMIN AUX BOEUPS RIGHT UP ON THE PAINED AND ON THE 
KERB BEFORE WE COME THROUGH TO THE 
S. E. S. AS YOU COME THROUGH HERE YOU 
HAVE TO SACRIFICE THIS THE PIT 
LANE EXIT ON YOUR RIGHT HAND SIDE 
BEFORE WE COME UP TO THE LAST AND 
A TRICKY FINAL CORNER UP OVER THE 
KERB BEFORE DRIVING IT HIDEOUT 
BACK TOWARDS THE CHEQUERED FLAG 
THE LAP RECORD STANDS WITH 
VALENTINO ROSSI ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE 
THE GRID CLEARING AND PRETTY TENSE 
HERE I ASK THE RIDERS IF THEY WANT 
TO TALK TO ME BEFORE I GO BOUNDING 
UP TO THEM STEVE AND CHARLIE IN 
THE COMMENTARY BOX 
THE START HERE IT IS REALLY 
CRUCIAL THERE ARE PARTS OF THIS 
TRACK THAT IF YOU DO NOT GET THEM 
RIGHT YOU SCREW UP THE WHOLE LAP 
I WOULD USE AS EXHIBIT A COLIN 
EDWARDS HE WAS POLE POSITION LAST 
YEAR HE GOT AT OF THE FIRST AGED 
CAME IN SEVENTY EIGHT 
YES THE BRAVE ONES WILL BE ON THE 
OUTSIDE WHO WILL BE ON THE INSIDE 
FOR THE LEFT HAND SIDE AND THE 
MORE MATURE ONES WILL STAY ON THE 
INSIDE YOU CAN VERY EASILY MAKE UP 
THREE PLACES LOSE THE WHOLE RACE 
BY A FALLING OFF LOSE A LOT OF 
GROUND IT IS A CRITICAL CORNER 
GETTING INTO THAT CORNER IS 
IMPORTANT FIRST OF IT SHOULD BE A 
VERY INTERESTING FIRST CORNER THE THE THOUGHTS ABOUT THE WEATHER IT IS 
AS IT HAS BEEN ALL DAY BLACK 
CLOUDS AND BRIGHT SUNSHINE IF IT 
IS DRY LET'S HAVE SOME PREDICTIONS 
OF WAS THAT WE WILL NOT GET WET 
HERE 
THERE HAS BEEN SOME DRIVING RAIN 
OUTSIDE THE DOOR IF IT STAYS DRY 
I AGREE WITH YOU I REALLY WANT TO 
SEE COLIN BACK BECAUSE IT IS 
OVERDUE BUT I THINK WELL WITH 
VALENTINO ROSSI 
I WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE HIM TAKE HIS FIRST WIN BUT I 
THINK DANI PEDROSA WILL WIN FOR A 
STAB WHAT IS YOUR PREDICTION 
WHAT A BAD IF IT IS WET CHRIS CHRIS VERMEULEN WILL BE A REAL THREAT 
WILL THAT HELP JAMES IF IT RAINS 
YES HE HAS NOT GOT A GOOD SET UP 
THEY ARE NOT QUITE THERE 
O. K. OFF 
WITH YOU 
SHE NEVER TELLS US HER 
PREDICTIONS CASEY STONER HE WILL ALREADY BE IN 
THE HUNT EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE IN 
THIS CHAMPIONSHIP 
IN THIS SERIES 
THERE IS NO STOPPING OF RACES AND 
AFTER THEY HAVE LEFT THE LINE 
EVERYONE WILL BE FRANTICALLY 
GETTING THE BIKES READY FOR WET 
WEATHER WHICH WILL MEAN THEY WILL 
HAVE TO PUT THE STEEL DISCS ON THE 
FRONT THEY WILL BE CHANGING THE 
STRINGS AS BRINGS FRANTIC ACTION 
IN THE PIT LANE FUSS THAT AGREED 
AERIAL SHOT OF 
THE FIRST CORNER WE HAVE HAD RAIN ALREADY IN BOTH OF THE OTHER RACES IN BETWEEN THE SUNSHINE 
YES A BIT MORE BLUE SKY SUNSHINE AND WE HAVE SEEN ALL DAY LONG L. THINK WE WILL GET AWAY WITH IT WE ONLY EVER GET AWAY WITH IT REALLY CHALLENGING A NEW PART OF 
THIS CIRCUIT 
THIS THEY HAVE SHORT 
AND THE CORNER BIT THE TARMAC IS 
ALARMING THEM TO RUN OFF BECAUSE 
WE HAD SO MANY CRASHES LAST YEAR 
THEY HAVE FLATTENED IT AND A BIT 
TOO 
THIS IS COMING DOWN TO CHEMIN TOO AUX BOEUPS INTO THIS VAST LEFT AND 
RIGHT AFFLICT THE STOCK CATHOLIC EVERYONE TRYING TO GET AS MUCH HEAT 
INTO THEIR TYRES AS POSSIBLE 
REALLY LEANING THE BIKE OVER 
SQUEEZING THE BRAKES AND EVERYTHING 
ELSE SO PEDROSA HIS STARTS ARE PRETTY 
GOOD AND HE IS ON POLL HE HAS TO 
GET OVER TO THE LEFT 
YES WE KNOW 
THE DUCATI HE ACCELERATES REALLY 
HARD SO GOOD SO STONER COULD GO 
TO THE INSIDE 
WE ARE AWAY A 
CRACKING START FROM COLIN EDWARDS 
GET THE DROP OF CASEY STONER BUT 
PEDROSA HAS MADE IT STICK A GREAT BIG RUN FROM JAMES TOSELAND 
THE SECOND OF THE YELLOW MACHINES 
JAMES IS UP INTO FIFTH PLACE 
SOMEBODY TAKING A SHORT CUT BRILLIANT STUFF FROM JAMES TOSELAND 
TWO PLACES UP L. CAN'T WORK OUT 
WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE COLIN 
CLEARLY GOT OFF THE LINE FIRST BUT 
THAT DUCATI REALLY KICKED IN I I LOVE THE FACT THAT DANI PEDROSA HAD 
A LOOK OVER HIS SHOULDER JUST TO 
SEE BUT I'D HEARD IT HERE 
COULD 
I TURN HERE NOT A TREMENDOUS START FROM VALENTINO BUT HE IS IN THE PACK JAMES JUST GOT SHUFFLED BACK A BIT 
VERMEULEN JUST MUSCLED HIS WAY PAST 
IT IS ROSSI AND VERMEULEN NOW OR IN 
FRONT JAMES TOSELAND IS UP FOR A 
SCRAP THAT WILL BE FUN TO WATCH STONER FROM PEDROSA FROM COLIN 
EDWARDS VALENTINO ROSSI OF COURSE 
VERMEULEN AND TOSELAND 
THE DUCATI 
EVEN ON THE SHORT STRAIGHT HAS 
ENORMOUS POWER L. THINK DANI 
PEDROSA WAS DOING A BIT OF BLOCKING 
HE WAS AWARE OF THE BIKE CLOSE 
BEHIND HIM CLOSING 
THE DOOR AGAIN LET'S SEE WHAT THE HONDA DOES UP THE INSIDE COLIN A WAY HERE NOW 
THIS IS HIS BEST CHANCE COLIN 
EDWARDS CAN GO FASTER THAN ANYONE 
IF HE CAN GET A CLEAR TRACK HE HAS 
GOT AWAY WELL LET'S SEE IF HE CAN 
CARRY ON 
WITH COLIN IT HAS ALWAYS 
BEEN THAT HE DOES THE FAST LAPS BUT 
HIS RACING IS NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH 
DANI PEDROSA IS THE QUICKER GUIDE 
ON THE CIRCUIT GUY DANI PEDROSA 
BELIEVES IN HIMSELF YOU CAN SEE 
THE BODY LANGUAGE IT IS MORE 
SPECTACULAR THE WAY HE ATTACKS I I THINK HE IS COMING TO GROW TALLER 
HE HAS GROWN TALLER IN STATURE AS 
FAR AS COPPERS IS CONCERNED NOT NOT SCARED OF THE RAIN NOW AS FAR AS 
CONFIDENCE IS CONCERNED 
HE HAS 
WORKED ON THE BRAKES YOU COULD 
TALK ABOUT HONDA NOT HAVING A 
PNEUMATIC ENGINE BUT WE HAVE HEARD 
THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN HE LOOKS LIKE A PNEUMATIC DRILL ON 
THE FRONT OF THAT ON THERE HE WAS 
GETTING RID OF ANY UNWANTED FLAB 
AROUND THE ARMS PEDROSA THAT IS 
AMAZING STONER HAS GOT A BIT TO THINK ABOUT 
RUNNING THAT THING HIM ON THE 
BRAKES CRANKED OVER DANI PEDROSA 
TRYING TO GET CLOSE TO CASEY STONER 
WHICH IS WORKING COLIN EDWARDS IS 
ABOUT TO GET THE UNWELCOME 
ATTENTION OF HIS OLD TEAM MATE 
VALENTINO 
HE IS VALENTINO IS ONE VALENTINO OF THE FASTER GUY IS ON THE TRACK 
HE HAS JUST PUT IN THE FASTEST LAP 
HE IS CLOSE ON THE BACK OF COLIN 
EDWARDS HE CAN GENERALLY PASSING 
QUITE EASILY IS THAT JAMES YES IS THERE A 
RIDER DOWN OR IS HE O. K. THAT IS BAD 
NEWS AND GOOD NEWS GLADKI LOOKS O. K. 
BUT ROTTEN LUCK HE HAD MADE A 
CRACKING START GLADKI LOOKS O. K. 
STONOR ONCE AGAIN ON THE BIG RED 
MACHINE GLAD HE LOOKS O. K. HOPEFULLY WE WILL GET TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO JAMES TOSELAND OH BOY THAT WAS ALMOST A LEAD 
TAPE TAKE NICELY DONE GOOD 
RECOVERY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
VALENTINO ROSSI IS ABOUT TO 
CAPITALISE HE VERY FIRM TAKING NO PRISONERS 
ARE YOU SURE THESE ARE NOT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVES NO NO THEY ARE MOTOGP BIKES I RECKON DANI PEDROSA IS THE 
QUICKEST GUY ON THE TRACK BUT HE 
IS REALLY GETTING BEATEN UP BY 
ROSSI 
HE DID REALLY WELL TO GET ROSSI BACK IN AT ALMOST HOLED OUT ROSSI 
AND ALMOST HOLED OUT ROSSI CLOSE 
BUT NO CIGAR 
HE IS SO CLASSED SO 
FAST INTO THAT CORNER IF HE COULD 
GET CLOSE ENOUGH HE COULD PASS 
STONE ON THE BREAKS INTO THAT 
CORNER STONER ON THE BRAKES 
STONER HAS GOT ROSSI ALL OVER THE 
BACK OF HIM BEAR IN MIND BOTH 
THESE FRONT RUNNERS STONER JUST 
HOLDING HIM OUT THE FRONT TWO GUYS 
ON BRIDGESTONE TYRES THEY ARE GOOD 
EARLY 
THEY ARE BATH STILL THINK EARLY DANI PEDROSA AS THE RACE GOES ON 
IS GOING TO BE TOUGH TO BEAT I 
STILL THINK L. AM SURE THERE IS 
GOING TO BE A CHANGE IN THE MINUTE 
TWENTY EIGHT LAPS THE JOURNEY ONLY FOUR 
DOWN SO PLENTY OF PUNISHMENT IN 
STORE FOR BOTH OF THESE TYRE 
MANUFACTURERS AND THESE ENGINES AND 
LORENZO'S FEET HE IS IN NINTH AT THE 
MOMENT MY EYES ARE STILL WATERING 
FROM THAT CRASHED YESTERDAY 
IT WAS 
VIRTUALLY BAREFOOT WATER SKIING 
THE WAY HE WAS SKIPPING ACROSS THE 
TOP OF THE GRAVEL AT THAT SPEED ROSSI THERE IS ALWAYS A 
CONCERTINA EFFECT WATCH HOW MUCH 
HE CLOSES IN RIGHT IN BEHIND HIM 
IF HE COULD JUST GET INTO THE 
BRAKING ZONE HE COULD PASS 
INTERESTINGLY THE TECH THREE TEAM 
THEY HAVE CHANGED TO A WIDER FRONT 
ROOM FOR THIS MEETING RIMMER 
THAT IS VALENTINA IT RIGHT BY VALENTINO RIGHT BEHIND US THE HONDA AND THE YAMAHA 
PARTICULARLY LOOK TO BE MORE NIMBLE 
THAN THE DUCATI IT LOOKS AS IF 
STONER IS WORKING THAT BIT HARDER I WOULD REMIND YOU THAT AT THE 
FRONT END OF THIS FIELD THE FIRST 
FOUR RIDERS ARE COVERED BY ZERO 
SEX OF A SECOND OH SIX CHRIS VERMEULEN IS ON A BRIGHT BLUE 
MACHINE THAT IS GOING TO CLOSE 
DOWN INTO FIVE WAY ALL OF THESE 
GUYS ARE TAKING A LITTLE BIT OUT OF 
EACH OTHER ROSSI DOWNY INSIDE 
DOWLER THE INSIDE SIDE BY SIDE THIS IS A REAL SCRAP ROSSI JUST RUNS IN A BIT TOO WIDE 
UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIM STONER GET 
ON HIS OWN AND RUNS HIM OUT A NEW LAP RECORD FOR COLIN EDWARDS 
AT THE MOMENT 
THAT IS ONE TICK IN 
THE BOX FOR COLIN THESE LONG OFF CAMERA RIGHT 
HANDERS SEEMED TO BE WHERE THE 
EBERHARDT TRACKS THAT MUCH TIGHTER 
OFF CAMBER WHETHER YAMAHA 
TRACKS THAT MUCH TIGHTER WHERE 
THEY YAMAHA THIS IS 
SHUFFLE YOU HAVE 
YAMAHA DUCATI HONDA ANOTHER 
YAMAHA THEN IT SUZUKI DIFFERENT 
MANUFACTURERS HE MADE THE MOVE COMING OUT OF THE 
RIGHT HANDER HAD THE POSITION FOR 
THE LEFT HANDER AT MUSEUM CORNER 
THESE ARE THE THREE BATTLING IT OUT 
FOR THE CHAMPION LORENZO IS ON NINTH 
HE IS LITERALLY ON DAMAGE 
LIMITATION 
THE BIG CRASH SHE HAD LIMITATION ON THE FRIDAY WHERE HE BRAKED TO A 
BIT TOO MUCH HE HAD ON ENTRANTS SPEED STONER IS A BIT 
SLOWER ON EXIT SPEED HE HAS IT 
ABOUT RIGHT ENTRANCE SPEED ON A TIGHT TRACK LIKE THIS WITH 
DIFFERENT RIDING STYLES TYRES AND 
BIKES EVERYWHERE HAS GOT THEIR 
STRENGTH YOU GET A CONCERTINA EFFECT HOW WILL NICKY HAYDEN FIELD ABOUT A 
BROKEN ANKLE SMALLER TESTICLES AND 
EVERYTHING ELSE 
HE GOT SUCH A 
GREAT START AS WELL DANI PEDROSA THIS IS HIS 
OPPORTUNITY CAN HE GET PAST HE IS 
MUCH BETTER ON THE BRAKES BUT 
NOBODY IS AS BRAVE AND SKILFUL AS 
VALENTINO ROSSI OF STICKING IT DOWN 
THE INSIDE HE SEEMS TO HAVE A BIT 
OF EXTRA CONFIDENCE OF 
HE IS PART 
MOTORBIKE RACER POT BALLERINA 
AT PART BALLERINA CASEY STONER'S BIKE IS NOT LOOKING HAPPY FOR US NOT DANI PEDROSA TRYING TO LINE UP HIS BIKE HE CANNOT QUITE DO IT THE HONDA LOOKS GOOD ON VALVES BEFORE STOCK VALVE SPEED THE REALLY HAVE GOT IT WORKING EXTREMELY WELL ALL CREDIT TO HIM THE WAY HE MOVES THE BIKE AROUND NOW HE IS RIGHT IN TOUCH THIS IS HIS BEST OPPORTUNITY I TELL YOU WHAT CASEY STONER 
SHOULD GET A BOX OF BERR FROM 
VALENTINO ROSSI BECAUSE WE SAW THE 
LIST OF GAP TIMES AND THE GAP IS 
OPENING UP BETWEEN VALENTINO ROSSI 
AND THE REST OF THEM CASEY STONER 
IS DOING A GOOD JOB HOLDING OFF 
DANI PEDROSA COLIN EDWARDS IS 
GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THIS AS WELL COLIN EDWARDS IS ALSO GETTING HELD UP IT IS EASY HERE YOU TRY IT OUT 
THERE YOU TRY AND BREAKING 
SOMEBODY LIKE CASEY STONER FOR DANI PEDROSA TO GET PAST HE 
HAS GOT TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE JUST 
THAT BIT MORE SIXTEEN POINTS IS BETTER THAN A TRIP TO HOSPITAL STILL EIGHTEEN LAPS TO GO DANI PEDROSA TRYING TO TAKE THE 
LONG WAY ROUND THIS IS VERY STRONG 
HE ALMOST LOST AT THE PLACE DE 
COLIN EDWARDS IN THE PROCESS BE 
PLACED TO COLIN EDWARDS THE PLACE TO COLIN EDWARDS A NEW LAP RECORD FOR VALENTINO ROSSI THIS IS LOVELY DOWN THE INSIDE 
BUT THEN HE IS ON THE OUTSIDE HE 
IS HANDING OUT ON YOUR LEFT IS THE 
DUCATI THEN AS THEY GOT TO THE 
NEXT CORNER 
DE THAT WAS A THREE 
CORNERED PASS A GREAT MOVE COLIN HAS 
BEEN STUDYING WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON HE HAS SEEN DANI PEDROSA RUN ROUND THE OUTSIDE LOOK AT THE DUCATI IT DOES NOT 
LOOK COMFORTABLE FOUR STAR THE THE SUSPENSION GET GOING JUST AS THEY GO TO TURN ON THE 
RIGHT CASES DINNER CASEY STONER 
KNEW THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO 
ABOUT IT 
CLEVER SCIENTIFIC STUFF 
THAT IS THE BATTLE NOW FOR SECOND 
PLACE BETWEEN THOSE BRAVE THOSE 
THREE CHRIS VERMEULEN FRACTIONS IF HE CAN JUST GET CLOSE TO THOSE 
GUYS HE CAN START PLAYING WITH 
THEM LORENZO IS NOT HANGING AROUND 
LOOK AT THE GAP TWENTY SIX FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
SECONDS DANI PEDROSA WILL HAVE TO 
GET WE GO ON STUNNING STUFF FROM 
LORENZO HE WILL NOT BE TAP DANCING 
FOR A WHILE BUT VERY USEFUL IN 
SIXTH PLACE COLIN IS THROUGH BUT HE CANNOT WHOLE BIT TIGHT ENOUGH HE CANNOT HOLD IT TIGHT ENOUGH IT DID NOT QUITE WORK FOR HIM 
MAYBE A DRESS REHEARSAL AS THE 
FUEL LOAD GOES DOWN AS THE TYRES 
LOSE THEIR EDGE BEGAN TO THE 
DUCATI WRIGGLING AND SQUIRMING 
TRYING TO GET THE GROUP DOWN WILL WILL FIND OUT MORE LATER ABOUT JAMES 
TOSELAND HE THINKS HE WAS TAKEN 
OUT BY ANDREA DOVIZIOSO FOUR STAR 
WILL FIND OUT LATER WE WILL FIND 
OUT LATER HE HAD DONE SO WELL HE 
WAS TENTH IN THE FIRST SESSION HE 
QUALIFIED VERY WELL I HOPE HE HAS NOT WEARING HIS 
CYCLING LEGS RUIN 
HAS HE WILL 
BE RIDING ROUND THE TRACK ON A 
BICYCLE AT DONINGTON'S RIDE OF 
CHAMPIONS HAVE YOU EVER RIDDEN A BICYCLE IT IS HARD WORK I CAN TELL YOU ARE THERE ANY BLUE MARKS ON THAT BIKE HE HAD A MAJOR EXCURSION AT THE 
VERY START AS WELL YES HE YES HE MANAGED TO STICK IT TOGETHER 
SOMEHOW THAT GAP IS BAD NEWS THE THE MAN TO WATCH NOW IS LORENZO HE IS DOING PRETTY WELL DEFINITELY 
PUTTING MORE PRESSURE ON CHRIS 
VERMEULEN JOHN HOPKINS AND ANDREA DOVIZIOSO PAST LORIS CAPIROSSI BEHIND COLIN EDWARDS CHRIS 
VERMEULEN N. LORENZO AND NICKY 
HAYDEN HAS HAD A BIT OF A RECOVERY 
IN SEVENTH PLACE HOPKINS IS IN 
EIGHTH NICKY HAYDEN WAS HAPPY DOWN THE BOTTOM THERE IS HE CLOSE ENOUGH CHRIS VERMEULEN IS HANGING ON TO 
THIS THE GOOD NEWS FOR CHRIS 
VERMEULEN IS THERE ARE SPOTS OF 
RAIN IN THE PIT LANE HE IS HALF 
MAN HALF FISH LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET THE BIKES 
WARMED UP BECAUSE IF THERE IS ANY 
MORE RAIN THERE ARE STILL BLUE 
SKIES LORENZO IS PHENOMENAL WHEN YOU 
THINK HOW BEATEN UP HE IS THE LAST 
TIME AROUND HE WAS FASTER THAN 
ANYONE BUT VALENTINO ROSSI 
I KNOW 
IT IS EARLY BUT WHO SAID THAT HE 
THOUGHT VALENTINO ROSSI COULD WIN 
THIS 
I HAVE NO IDEA L. HAVE A THIS SHORT TERM MEMORY PROBLEM LORENZO HAS GOT SO LITTLE POWER IN 
HIS LEGS AND WAS NOT IT IS HARD 
GRAFT ON YOUR LEGS THIS WAS THE MOVE A VERY BRAVE 
MOVE IT WOULD BE EASY FOR HIM TO 
THINK 
I CANNOT GET THIS RIGHT IF IF I WAS CHRIS VERMEULEN I WOULD KICK 
HIM ON THE FOOT 
THE WHITE FLAG SO 
YOU CAN NOW CHANGE YOUR BIKE IF YOU 
WISH THE RIDERS HAVE THE CHOICE TO COME 
MEN IT WILL BE TRICKY AT THE 
MOMENT THEY ARE STARTING TO GET THINGS 
READY IN THE PIT LANE 
THIS IS 
UNFORTUNATE FOR VALENTINO ROSSI 
THE HAS A BIG GAP HE HAS I THINK YOU WILL LOSE THIRTY FORTY SECONDS COMING IN PIER WILL MAKE THE GAMBLE WILL 
VALENTINO ROSSI KUMBH MELA WHO 
WILL MAKE A GAMBLE IF HE COMES IN EITHER STAY OUT HE COULD EASILY GET IT WRONG YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE NOTHING TO 
LOSE TO GAMBLE ON THIS LOT 
WHAT HE 
WON REALLY WANT IN THIS SITUATION 
IS FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO GO IN SEE 
IF THEY ARE FASTER THEN THE PIT 
CREW CAN GIVE THEM SOME INDICATION I DO NOT THINK THERE IS ENOUGH 
LOOKING OUT OF THE DOOR THERE IS 
NOT ENOUGH TO EVEN THINK ABOUT 
COMING IN AT THIS MOMENT WE ARE SCIENTIFIC WHICH AT THE 
GROUND AND IT IS AS STRAIGHT AS A 
BED WILL KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED 
AND SAVE THE STOCK SEEKS WE WILL 
KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED AND A C. AND SEE OH BOY THAT IS TIGHT THAT IS 
RANDY DE PUNIET FIRST UP THAT IS 
HIS HOME GRAND PRIX 
HE KNOWS IT IS 
ONLY FRENCH TRAINED BOUND TO BE 
SLIPPERY THAT IS FASCINATING RANDY DE PUNIET COMING UNDER PRESSURE THAT IS THE BATTLE FOR ELEVENTH TWELFTH 
AND THIRTEENTH THE FRENCHMAN IS A BIT 
FRUSTRATED HE WAS HOPING FOR 
BETTER BUT AS YOU HAVE SAID BEFORE HE HAS 
HAD A LOT OF CRASHES 
YES THE TEAM 
HAS RUN OUT OF BUDGET HE HAS GOT TO TRY 
AND HOLD THE PACE AND HE IS DOING IT TREMENDOUSLY WELL IT WAS THIRTY SIX LAST TIME IT IS NOW THIRTY ONE 
SO HE HAS LOST SOME GROUND BUT HE 
DOES NOT KNOW HOW FAST AGO DANI 
PEDROSA CAN LOOK UP THE TRACK AND 
SEEK THE YAMAHA IN FRONT OF HIM 
WATCHING DANI PEDROSA BEING ABLE 
TO HOLD UP HE COULD KEEP THE 
DUCATI AT 
THAT WAS A CHAIN BAD 
LUCK FOR THAT 
STRAYED OVER FOR 
LORIS CAPIROSSI 
THE CHAIN CAME OFF 
THE CAR WAS A KID THAT IS SO 
UNUSUAL THE CAT WAS A KEY KAWASAKI HE IS THE ONE GUY WHO CANNOT HAVE ANY MORE MOMENTS HE DOES NOT NEED THAT WITH A SHORT 
GAP TO THE NEXT ROUND PRIX ITALY 
JUNE FIRST GRAND PRIX THIS IS A GOOD BIT OF THIS CIRCUIT 
I THINK HE RAIN HAS GONE THE 
RAIN I THINK HE CAN GET THROUGH HERE FANTASTIC THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF YAMAHA CAN WE JUST REWIND FIFTEEN SECONDS LOOK 
AROUND NO RAIN AT ALL 
I CAN'T 
BELIEVE IT IT IS NOT RAINING HERE 
THE SUN IS OUT AT THIS END OF THE 
CIRCUIT A FEW SPOTS BUT STILL NOT 
ENOUGH BECAUSE THE SUN ON THE 
TRACK KEEPS IT RELATIVELY DRY LE MANS ALWAYS THROWS UP WHETHER SURPRISES THAT PICTURE WE SAW I RECKON IT 
WAS AN AIR CONDITIONING UNIT 
DRIPPING 
IF YOU ARE IN A HALL AS DRIPPING WINSTON CHURCHILL SAID STOP 
DIGGING IN A WHOLE THE HEAT IN YOUR TYRES GIVES YOU GRIP 
SLACK TYRES ARE AS GOOD AS GRIP ANYTHING UNLESS THERE IS RAIN AT 
LYING ON THE TRACK VALENTINO ROSSI SEEMS TO BE THE MASTER AT GAUGING THE GRIP A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN FROM THE 
BOYS AT YAMAHA 
I THINK YAMAHA HAVE 
GOT A BUCKET ABOVE THEIR GARAGE GUINTOLI IS HALF MIDLANDER HALF FRENCHMAN I THINK LORENZO HAS FORGOTTEN HE IS INJURED I THINK HE PROBABLY HAS REMEMBER I SAID YOU'VE GOT NOTHING 
TO LOSE WHY NOT 
HE IS NOW GOING 
TO BE LOST EVEN FURTHER AND HE IS 
GAMBLING IT IS GOING TO POUR WITH 
RAIN GOING TO BE LAST THIS IS A 
MENTAL RAIN IT IS HORRIBLE THEY 
ARE OBVIOUSLY PICKING UP A LOT MORE 
RAIN THAN EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE 
GRANDSTAND 
STONER HAS GOT A GRANDSTAND PROBLEM STONER IS OUT 
THE GREAT PROBLEM BATTLE IS OVER STONER IS OUT OF IT BUT PEDROSA 
LORENZO AND EDWARDS FURIOUS 
ACTIVITY DOWN AT YAMAHA THEY ARE 
OBVIOUSLY EXPECTING A CHANGE THAT THAT SOUNDED TO ME LIKE IT WAS REFFING 
AND DROP DRIVING REFFING I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHICH SCRIPT 
LORENZO HAS PICKED UP BUT IT IS 
THE I AM NOT AN INJURED RIDER 
SCRIPT WE JUST SAW THE YAMAHA PITS AND IT 
WAS RAINING BUT THE DUCATI PITS 
IT IS DRY YOU HAVE SAID THIS A MILLION 
TIMES OH COLIN FIGHTS BACK 
JAMS IN ON THE INSIDE OF PEDROSA 
PEDROSA PERHAPS BEING A BIT MORE 
CAUTIOUS AS THE RAIN STARTS TO FALL 
IN CHINA PEDROSA WAS VERY GOOD IN 
THE WET BUT HE NEVER LIKES THESE 
AWKWARD CONDITIONS WHERE YOU DON'T 
DO WHAT THE PACE IS 
AS I WAS 
SAYING IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT MORE 
RAIN WHEN YOU ON THE BACK OF THE 
BIKE 
IT SEEMS THAT MUCH MORE BIKE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE M. P. H. 
WHEN YOU'RE DOING CASEY STONER FOURTH IN THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP WITH FIFTY SIX POINTS IS 
GOING AWAY WITH NOTHING HERE 
BEACON AND A FOUR CASEY STONER 
THE IGNOMINY FOR CASEY STONER I THINK IT WAS THE DRIVE SYSTEM 
SOMEWHERE THE ENGINE STILL SOUNDED 
O. K. STONER IS NOT PLEASED WHEN THINGS 
DON'T GO WELL 
THIS IS 
EXTRAORDINARY THAT ROSSI IS ABLE TO 
ADAPT THESE GUYS BURGESS SAID THEY 
HAD GONE FOR THE HARDER TYRE BUT 
ONE THAT WOULD WORK IN THE HEAT AT 
THE MOMENT LAP TIMES LOOK AT 
THIS TEN SECONDS 
VALENTINO IS BY A MILE THE MOST GIFTED GUY IN DIFFICULT CONDITIONS STONER IS ON A WET WEATHER BY CANAL HE IS ALLOWED TO BUY THE RULES STILL SOME SPOTS OF RAIN ON THE CAMERA VALENTINO ROSSI IS PRETTY CAMERA UNFAZED BY MOST CHANGEABLE 
CONDITIONS HE IS PROBABLY THE MOST 
SKILLED GUY OUT THERE 
IF IT STOPS 
RAINING HE CAN AFFORD TO JUST 
CRUISE ROUND SIX LAPS TO GO THIS THIS WILL BLOW THE CHAMPIONSHIP WIDE 
OPEN VALENTINO HIS THIRD AT THE 
MOMENT TWO POINTS BEHIND LORENZO 
WHO IS SEVEN POINTS BEHIND PEDROSA 
STONER IS NOW OUT OF IT CAPIROSSI 
IS BACK IN FIFTH A GOOD RIDE FROM CHRIS VERMEULEN 
HE IS LAPPING VERY SOLIDLY THE 
SCRAP IS STILL GOING ON IT WILL BE A LOT OF FUN FOR CASEY 
STONER RIDING BIKE WITH DRY TYRES ROUND WET TRACK 
IF THERE A CLOUDBURST NOW HE 
WOULD BE IN THE FRONT SEAT 
YES HE 
WOULD BE IN GOOD SHAPE SO WOULD 
THE SKY VALENTINO ROSSI HAS A TEN 
SECOND BUFFER SO WOULD THIS GUY 
IT 
IS A PRETTY LONG PIT LANE ROSSI COULD AFFORD IT BECAUSE HE IS NINE SECONDS IN FRONT LORENZO JUST SET THE FASTEST LAP FOR THAT ONLY FOUR LAPS LEFT IF IT HAS COMPLETELY STOPPED 
RAINING DIFFICULT FOR US TO STAY 
PEDROSA WILL GATHER HIMSELF UP 
AGAIN I RECKON IT IS DRY AND PEDROSA WILL 
HAVE ANOTHER BIG STAB AT COLIN IN 
THE MINUTE DOVIZIOSO HAS HAD A COLOURFUL 
RAISED HE IS UP IN SIX HE HAS 
MADE GOOD HEADWAY A COLOURFUL 
RACE CAN'T SAY TOO MUCH ABOUT TONI 
ELIAS DANI PEDROSA'S TARGET IS SIMPLY 
COLIN EDWARDS HE HAS TWO AND A BIT 
LAPS TO GO CAN HE GET PAST COLIN 
EDWARDS AND GRAB THE FINAL SPOT ON 
THE PODIUM IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR 
HIS CHAMPIONSHIP HE LEADS THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP FROM JORGE LORENZO 
SEVEN POINTS THIS WOULD BE A BIG 
KNOCK FOR HIS CHAMPIONSHIP AS FAR 
AS ROSSI IS CONCERNED THESE GUYS ARE THE BEST IN THE 
WORLD BY SOME MARGIN CERTAINLY 
THESE FRONT GUYS JORGE LORENZO THE MAJORCA AND RIDER JUST TWENTY ONE LORIS CAPIROSSI AN EXPERIENCED 
CHARGE OF STILL YOUNG ENOUGH AS 
FAR AS I AM CONCERNED AND THE TWO THOUSAND SIX 
WORLD CHAMPION POOR OLD NICKY 
HAYDEN 
IT LOOKED TO ME LIKE HAYDEN CAPIROSSI WAS GETTING IN THE MODEL 
ON THAT CORNER 
NICKY HAYDEN IS 
DESPERATE TO GRAB SEVENTH POSITION FROM 
CAPIROSSI BACK AT THE FRONT VALENTINO ROSSI 
A CROSS THE STRIPE RIDING A HANDS 
AND HEELS AWAY FROM EVERYBODY ELSE 
ON THE LAST LAP IMPLAUSIBLY HOP 
ALONG LORENZO IS UP THERE INTO 
SECOND PLACE COULD IT LOOKS AS 
THOUGH HE HAS A COMFY ENOUGH BUFFER 
OVER COLIN EDWARDS HE STARTED IN 
SECOND PLACE HE IS COMING TO GET 
THE PODIUM ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL 
NOTHING VISIBLE IN MOTOGP AS SUZY 
SAID AT THE TOP OF THE SHOW WHAT A 
SHOVEL IT HAS BEEN NOTHING IS 
NORMAL IT MOTOGP ANY MORE WHAT A 
SHUFFLE I RECKON LORENZO IS COMFORTABLE 
OVER EDWARDS UNLESS SOMETHING 
HORRENDOUS HAPPENS ONLY A FEW 
CORNERS LEFT DOWN THE BACK STRAIGHT ONE MORE TIME HE MAKES IT LOOK SO EASY I THINK 
THEY ARE HIS LUCKY GLOVES NO LOAD 
FORD NO NEED FOR THE PIT LANE 
THIS IS THE LAST CORNER THE BOYS 
ARE GETTING READY FOR THE DOCTOR 
VALENTINO ROSSI IS JUST GOING TO 
CRUISE ACROSS THE LINE HE WINS IN 
FRANCE LORENZO WHO CAN OBVIOUSLY 
WALK ON WATER GET ACROSS IN SECOND 
PLACE COLIN EDWARDS FANTASTIC HE 
GETS A PODIUM WE WOULD LOVE HIM TO 
WIN ELEVEN DAY BUT A PODIUM WILL DO 
NICELY DANI PEDROSA IS OFF AND 
CHRIS VERMEULEN WINS THE RACE INTO 
FIFTH PLACE ANDREA DOVIZIOSO IN 
SIXTH COLIN EDWARDS AND VALENTINO ROSSI 
SHAKING HANDS WHAT A FANTASTIC 
RACE THAT IS THE RACE OF THE YEAR 
BY A COUNTRY MILE ALL OF THE 
YELLOW SHIRTS THAT IS THE 
VALENTINO ROSSI FAN CLUB A LEGION 
OF MEMBERS HOW ABOUT COLIN EDWARDS SO PLEASED HE HAS GOT A PODIUM 
HE PREDICTED HE WOULD WIN BUT A 
PODIUM IS GOOD RESULT 
IT IS A SHAME WE HAVE NOT HAD BOTH 
RIDERS FINISHING THE RACE JAMES 
WAS TAKEN BY ANOTHER RIDER BUT 
TODAY IT IS A GREAT RESULT THANK 
YOU EVERYBODY 
IT IS AN AMAZING RESULTS THEY HAVE 
WORKED SUPREMELY HARD THAT TEAM 
IT IS A SHAME ABOUT JAMES 
ANDREA DOVIZIOSO TOOK HIS NOSE AWAY 
YES AS WE WATCH VALENTINO ROSSI 
HIS BIKE WAS HIJACKED HE IS 
GETTING A RIDE HOME ON HIS OWN 
BIKE I FEEL SORRY FOR JAMES OF US 
NOT THAT IS REALLY INFURIATING 
BECAUSE ESPECIALLY IN THESE 
CONDITIONS IT WAS A DOG FIGHT 
THIS IS THE SORT OF CONDITION WHICH 
JAMES WOULD HAVE THRIVED IN 
WITHOUT QUESTION THE RACE OF THE 
YEAR 
RACE OF THE YEAR SO FAR 
AND YES I 
THINK SO CLASSIC VALENTINO ROSSI 
HE DEALT WITH THE CONDITIONS BETTER 
THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THOSE 
CONDITIONS HE WAS RIDING WELL 
WHAT HER ACHIEVEMENT FOR THIS GUY 
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD WRITTEN HIM OFF 
BUT HE IS BACK WHAT AN 
ACHIEVEMENT 
SOMEBODY SAID AT THE ACHIEVEMENT START WE SHOULD NOT HAVE STARTED 
WITH BRIDGED JONES THEY WOULD WELL 
TODAY BRIDGESTONE TYRES WERE 
STOCK YES THEY DID WELL TODAY 
VALENTINO ROSSI SAID HE WANTED THE 
TYRES AND HE GOT THEM AND HE IS 
RIGHT THERE IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP HE HE HAS GOT AN ABACUS UP THERE HAVE 
YOU DONE THE MATHS 
I AM WORKING AS 
FAST AS I CAN VALENTINO ROSSI WILL 
MOVE IN FRONT OF LORENZO UP INTO 
SECOND PLACE IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
ONE SECOND I WILL WORK IT OUT 
YOU HAVE GOT A CALCULATOR ON YOUR 
PHONE 
AND I HAVE TURNED IT OFF PHONE SURELY THE RENTS ARE WILL BE 
LEADING LORENZO 
HANG ON VALENTINO ROSSI IS WINNING 
ISN'T HE 
LEAVE HIM UP THERE ON HIS OWN ALL 
HE HAS GOT TO DO IS ADD SOME 
FIGURES UP HERE HE COMES 
VALENTINO ROSSI 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS MAN IS HE 
HUMAN 
I DO NOT THINK SO TO RIDE HUMAN AROUND LIKE HE DID IN THOSE 
CONDITIONS PHENOMENAL WHAT A 
START HE HAS BLOWN EVERYONE AWAY 
I HAVE WORKED IT OUT FINALLY NINETY SEVEN FINALLY NINETY SEVEN APIECE FOR THE FRONT TWO BUT 
BECAUSE VALENTINO ROSSI HAS WON 
BOTH MORE RACES HE WILL LEAD THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP BUT IN A ROSSI AND 
DANI PEDROSA OR TIED FOR THE LEAD 
AND I NEED A REST NOW COLIN COLIN EDWARDS IS ON THE PODIUM 
THE MOST POPULAR PODIUM OF THE DAY 
CONGRATULATIONS A GREAT DAY TO DO 
IT 
YES THE TOP THREE MY BIKE AND IT TYRES WERE GREAT THE OTHER STORY 
WAS I COULD NOT GET AROUND THEM L. 
FELT LIKE I HAVE MORE PACE BUT I 
COULD NOT GET THROUGH THE STOCK BUT 
IT WAS NOT A BAD RESULT 
NOT A BAD RESULT IT WAS GREAT IT 
WAS A DIFFICULT RACE THOSE THOSE CONDITIONS SPOILT IT A BIT BECAUSE 
NOBODY WAS SURE WHAT WAS GOING ON INCREDIBLE THE ONE TWO THIRTY FOUR YAMAHA 
SENSATIONAL JUST WHEN WE THOUGHT 
THAT THE CHAMPIONSHIP WAS ALREADY 
OPEN AND COMPETITIVE IT CANNOT BE 
CLOSER 
PITCH ON WHICH IT HAS CLOSER REALLY TIGHTENED UP L. THOUGHT THIS 
WOULD BE LORENZA'S BAD WEEKEND YOU YOU CANNOT BODY WITH FRACTURES HE HAS 
TWO BROKEN ANKLES YOU CANNOT 
ARGUE WITH FRACTURES SURELY POINTS 
WOULD HAVE BEEN A BONUS 
HE GOT TWENTY 
A DID YOU SEE HIS GOLD BOOTS HE HE GETS HIMSELF IN A TWIST AS TO 
WHETHER HE WEARS HIS RED BOOTS OR 
HIS GOLD BOOTS THIS HAS GONE ON 
ALL SEASON HE GOT SO CONFUSED IN 
CHINA HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO 
IT 
HE SHOULD WEAR A NAPPY AFTER IT THE JUMP OFF THE KERB IN PRACTICE 
THANK YOU FOR BAD FOR THAT 
A GREAT RACE STUNNING THAT IS 
WHAT MOTOR SPORT IS ALL ABOUT IT 
IS NO WONDER THEY LOVE MOTOGP HAVE 
YOU GOT SOME RESULTS STANDINGS FOR 
US 
I HAVE BEEN WORKING MY FINGERS US TO THE BONE 
JAMES TOSELAND WHAT A NIGHTMARE 
FOR THE BRITISH RIDER AFTER A 
SUPERB START HE LOOKED REALLY GOOD 
HE SPENT THE WHOLE WEEKEND LEARNING 
THE TRACK THINGS HAD GONE WELL 
WITH HIM BUT LET US SEE HIS START THIS HE GOT A REALLY GOOD START OF THE THIRD LINE MARCO MELANDRI DID NOT GET AWAY AT 
ALL BUT JAMES IS UP ON THE INSIDE 
HERE LOOK AT HIM GO THINGS ARE NOT GOING RIGHT FOR MARCO MELANDRI JAMES WAS ABSOLUTELY FURIOUS 
ANDREA DOVIZIOSO MADE A COCK UP OF 
IT HE CAME IN THEN HE COULD WIDE 
ON JAMES THEN HE TOOK HIM OUT A. N. N. A. N. N. JAMES IS BOASTER BE THE WILD RIDER 
JAMES IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE WILD 
WIDER 
LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE WIDER MOVES WE SAW IN THAT RACE SOME OF THE PASSING MOVES WERE 
FANTASTIC THIS ONE DANI PEDROSA 
FOLLOWING CASEY STONER ATTEMPTING ATTEMPTING TO TAKE THE LEAD HERE THEN HE GOT IT ALL WRONG THE 
FRONT END LOCKED UP HE RAN VERY 
WIDE LETTING EVERYONE ELSE GET 
THROUGH BUT HE DID A GOOD JOB OF 
SAVING THAT 
THIS IS VALENTINO ROSSI MUSCLING 
HIS WAY DOWN HE WAS STRONG AT THE 
BEGINNING HE LOOKED SO MUCH MORE 
CONFIDENT AND EVERYONE ELSE 
WE ARE 
REALLY SEEING VINTAGE VALENTINO 
ROSSI STRONG AND SOLID THIS IS HIM DOWN 
THE INSIDE HE RAN A LITTLE BIT 
WIDE CASEY STONER SAYS RIGHT YOU 
HAVE LEFT ME A GAP I WILL RUN YOU 
OUT TO THE EDGE OF THE TRACK 
ANOTHER MOVE FROM DANI PEDROSA AN EXCELLENT RACE IT WAS SUPERB I THINK WE CAN HAVE A CHAT WITH THE MAN HIMSELF MATTER IS WITH HIM 
CONGRATULATIONS TWO WENT ON THE 
BANDS TWO PERFECT PERFORMANCES 
TWO WINS IN A ROW 
IT IS A LONG 
TIME SINCE I WON TWO RACES IN EIGHT 
ROAD WE ARE ON THE PACE WE ARE 
BACK IN BUSINESS L. AM VERY HAPPY 
IT WAS A DIFFICULT PERIOD BUT NOW 
WE ARE SO STRONG THE LAP WITH 
ANGEL NIETO ON THE BIKE WAS 
UNFORGETTABLE NINETY VICTORIES IN MY 
CAREER A GREAT NUMBER NOW I'LL 
NOW WE ARE ALSO AT THE TOP OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP WE ARE TRYING TO WIN 
SO WE HAVE TO STAY CONCENTRATED 
FIRST OF IT SEEMS ANGEL NIETO CAN 
STILL RIDE A BIKE HE IS VERY FAST 
HE IS LESS THAN ONE SECOND SLOWER 
THAN US 
HE IS BACK IN BUSINESS 
YES HAPPY 
SMILING THAT IS SPECIAL PACKAGE 
RIDING THE BENAYOUN YAMAHA WITH 
THE WORLD CHAMPION OR THE FIVE 
TIMES WORLD CHAMPION SITTING 
BEHIND YOU 
AFTER THE CHINESE RACE 
THAT WAS NOT THAT EXCITING SO MANY 
PEOPLE SAID IT WAS BRILLIANT IT 
WAS ONLY BECAUSE HE WON 
CREDIT TO 
HIM HE HAS LIFTED THIS BOARD 
THE SPORT HE STILL WANTED TO BE 
WINNING 
ASTONISHING WITH WINNING VALENTINO ROSSI BUT JERRY BURGESS 
WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW QUICK THE 
TYRES WARMED UP AND HOW IMPORTANT 
IT WAS 
YES AT THE BEGINNING 
EVERYTHING GOT INTO PLACE AND THEN 
BIT BY BIT HE CHIPPED HIS WAY 
THROUGH HE DID NOT HAVE IT ALL HIS 
OWN WAY CASEY STONER RAN HIM OUT 
AT THE BEGINNING BUT HE IS SO 
SOLID 
THE MAN OF THE RACE FOR MATE SOLID WAS ALL HALER RENZO WAS LORENZO 
AN INCREDIBLE RESULT YOU MUST NOT 
KNOW WHETHER TO CRY OR SMILE 
YES I WILL SMILE BECAUSE NOW WE 
HAVE TO CELEBRATE WERE STOPPED IN 
NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THE PAIN NOW 
NOBODY IS REALLY PAINFUL MY BODY 
BUT MIKE PERSONALITY IS SO HAPPY 
MY PERSONALITY 
THE FIRST HALF 
SEEMED MORE DIFFICULT AND HIS 
SECOND THAN THE SECOND 
YES IT 
HAS BEEN RAINING IN THE MIDDLE OF 
THE RACE IT WAS A DANGEROUS 
SITUATION FOR THE RIDERS IT WAS 
DIFFICULT TO KEEP ON THE BIKE 
AN AN OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE WELL DONE AN INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE ASTONISHING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT HE HAD TO COME ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
HE DID NOT COME AWAY WELL AT THE 
START THIS IS HIM PASSING CHRIS 
VERMEULEN THAT WAS A TOUGH MOVE 
THIS IS HIM SITTING BEHIND COLIN 
EDWARDS DOWN THE INSIDE AGAIN 
THAT IS WHERE HE CRASHED HEAVILY ON 
FRIDAY HE HAS TO BE COMMITTED TO 
DO THE SAME THAT IS ANOTHER ONE WHERE IT 
BOBBLES HE WAS SO FAST PRETTY 
MUCH EVERYWHERE HE WAS ABLE TO 
PASS 
WITH THE INJURIES HE IS CARRYING 
THE HAVE TWO CRASHES THIS WEEKEND 
WE SHOWED YOU ONE EARLIER AND HE 
HAD THAT MOMENT DURING QUALIFYING 
BECAUSE HE COULD NOT STAND UP HE 
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE 
DAMAGED HIS CONFIDENCE BUT TODAY 
HE RODE SUCH A CLEVER RACE 
THE ONE THAT SHOULD HAVE KILLED HIS 
CONFIDENCE WAS THE CRASH IN 
PRACTICE WHERE HE SMACKED HIS HEAD 
ON THE GROUND HARD THAT NORMALLY 
WOULD MAKE SOMEBODY BACK WAY BUT 
HE MUST BE ABLE TO ERASE HIS MEMORY 
BANKS 
I THINK IT HAS KNOCKED HIM BANKS SENSELESS I THINK HE IS PERHAPS A SENSELESS LUNATIC LUNATIC CHARLIE HAVE YOU GOT SOME 
STANDINGS 
THERE IS THE CONSTRUCTORS 
CHAMPIONSHIP COURTESY OF MR. ROSSI 
AND MR. LORENZO YAMAHA ARE WAY OUT 
IN FRONT 
WE WILL COME BACK TO THE STANDINGS 
IN A MINUTE A QUESTION PEOPLE ARE 
PROBABLY WONDERING IS QUITE DOES HE 
KEEP IT IN HIS FOOT DOWN 
HE IS 
SHIFTING HIS BODY WEIGHT AROUND 
GOING INTO THE CORNERS WHAT HE 
DOES HIS HE TAKES HIS FOOT OF THE 
FOOT REST YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR TOE 
ON THE FOOTREST AS YOU DO THAT 
THE BRAKING FORCE MAKES YOUR FOOT 
GO OUT IN FRONT HE ADDS A BIT MORE 
WEIGHT TO THE INSIDE OF THE BIKE 
ONE OR TWO OTHER RIDERS ARE 
STARTING TO DO THAT NOW 
HE COULD 
DO WORSE THAN VALENTINO YOU CAN 
SEE THE BOY IS PREPARING TO GO OUT 
ON THE PODIUM HOBBLING JORGE WILL 
BE OUT THERE TO STOP CHARLIE A 
GREAT RESULT FOR YAMAHA 
A HAT 
TRICK COULDN'T BE BETTER THE MAN 
THAT FINISHED SECOND THERE HE IS 
MANAGED TO QUALIFY SECOND AND GET 
ON THE PODIUM IT IS A CLEAN SWEEP 
NO MATTER WHAT TYRES THEY PUT ON 
HIM 
COLIN WAS FURIOUS YESTERDAY HIM WITH MARCO MELANDRI WHEN HE MESSED 
UP HIS FIRST LAP 
IT WAS 
ASTONISHING 
BOY IS THIS DESERVED ONE DAY 
THAT TOP STEP A TWO TIMES WORLD 
SUPERBIKE CHAMPION COLIN EDWARDS 
HE HAD HIS FIRST PODIUM FOR YAMAHA 
AT THIS TRACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE COLIN 
EDWARDS THIRD AGAIN NOW LORENZO 
HOW ABOUT THIS AS THE 
UNDERSTANDABLY TAKES HIS TIME 
GETTING TO THE PODIUM HE STARTED 
FROM HIS LOWEST GRID POSITION FOR 
THE YEAR NOT DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE 
NORMALLY QUALIFIES IN POLL HE HAS 
ACHIEVED THE HIGHEST EVER SCORE 
AFTER FIVE RACES IN THIS PREMIERE 
CLASS HIGHEST EVER POINTS SCORE 
THAT IS A MAGNIFICENT ACHIEVEMENT 
WHAT ABOUT THIS GUY VALENTINO 
ROSSI AS WE JUST SAW HAD THE 
LEGEND ANGEL NIETO DOUBLE HIM 
AROUND ON HIS OWN BIKE TO BRING HIM 
BACK HE HAS EQUALLED THE NINETY G. P. 
WINS ACHIEVED BY ANGEL NIETO BUT 
HE HASN'T HAD BACK TO BACK 
VICTORIES SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX WITH THE 
ITALIAN AND CATALAN GRAND PRIX IS 
IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING 
GRAND PRIX ADS FUNDS FANTASTIC 
STUFF 
HE IS A NEW FORCE JORGE LORENZO 
ASTONISHING STUFF 
THE PRESIDENT CONGRATULATED ALL THE 
RIDERS THE BOSS OF A WHOLE WORLD 
WIDE SHOOTING MATCH WILL PROVIDE 
THE TROPHY TO THE GREATEST OF ALL 
TIME 
FAN CLUB FOLLOWS HIM EVERYWHERE 
THEY DON'T NEED TO HE HAS FANS 
WHENEVER HE GOES BRIDGESTONE FIRST 
ROSSI TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT 
IS PUT TOGETHER SEEING IF HE CAN 
RE ENGINEER IT APPEARED AS SUZY 
WAS SAYING WHAT A CLEAN SWEEP FOR 
YAMAHA 
EVERYBODY IS RATHER CAREFULLY 
CLEARING THE COUNTRY AS FAST AS 
THEY CAN BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT IS 
COMING NEXT DON'T YOU THOSE SILLY 
GIRLS IN RED TO BUT THEY ARE NOT 
GETTING OUT OF THE WAY WELL 
LORENZO OF COURSE IS IN A 
HOPELESS POSITION HE IS TRYING TO 
WIN A CHAMPAGNE SPRAYING 
COMPETITION SAT DOWN LOCH HE 
HASN'T GOT A PRAYER SAT DOWN SO 
ROSSI LORENZO AND EDWARDS L. 
TOILED AWAY LONG AND HARD WORKING 
ON THE STANDINGS AND I WILL NOW 
EXPLAIN AT HOPEFULLY PROVE MY MATHS 
ARE RIGHT 
THE BIG SHUFFLE IN ONE RACE THERE 
WASN'T THERE SOMEBODY THAT 
PROBABLY FELT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
ON THE PODIUM AND HE WOULD HAVE 
THOUGHT THAT FROM QUALIFYING IS 
CASEY STONER 
HE WAS STRUGGLING A 
BIT GOING BACKWARDS BUT HE 
PROBABLY WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN 
THERE 
IF HE IS REALLY WE ARE THERE THRILLED 
OFF THE STOCKLINE OR HE THRILLED WAS PRETTY SPECIAL THE START 
LINE YOU COULD ACTUALLY HEAR THE 
ENGINE REV ENSURE THE CLUTCH BROKE 
HE IT WAS A FORLORN FIGURE COMING 
IN I AM SURE THE CLUTCH BROKE 
HE HOPED IT WAS GOING TO CHUCK IT 
DOWN WITH RAIN 
YOU NEVER KNOW 
LAST YEAR COLIN EDWARDS DID THE 
SAME EVERYTHING IS WORTH IT HE IS 
CHASING HIS CHAMPIONSHIP 
JAMES HAS 
ALSO BEEN SHUFFLED DOWN IN THE 
STANDINGS AFTER THAT RACE 
UNFORTUNATE LUCK FOR HIM MATT 
CAUGHT UP WITH HIM EARLIER THIS IS 
WHAT HE HAD TO SAY

NEXT YEAR THIS IS THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE TEAM IT 
IS A CHINESE MANUFACTURER 
INVOLVING NONE OTHER THAN JOHN 
SURTEES AND GARY TAYLOR WHO USED 
TO BE WITH SUZUKI 
WHEN I WAS INTRODUCED TO THE IDEA 
WHEN I WAS FOLLOWING UP THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF YOUNG DRIVER 
PROGRAMMES WITH FOUR WHEELS THIS 
SUGGESTION WAS MADE AND I THOUGHT 
TO BRING CHINA IN AS MANUFACTURER 
WOULD BE WONDERFUL FOR MOTORCYCLING 
AND ALSO WONDERFUL TIKRIT SOME 
BRIDGES BETWEEN EUROPEAN TECHNOLOGY 
AND THIS COUNTRY IT'S THAT THE 
BUZZ GOING AND YOU HAVE SEEN THE 
RESULTS RESULTS SO IT WILL BE ON SCREEN NEXT YEAR 
IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP IT WILL BE 
TESTED THIS YEAR TO GET IT UP TO 
SPEC NO NEWS OF RIDERS WE THINK 
THEY COULD BE A BRITON 
WE HOPE SO 
WITH JOHN SURTEES GARY TAYLOR 
STEVE HARRISON INVOLVED I AM SURE 
THEY WILL WANT A CHINESE RIDER AS 
WELL THOUGH 
HE SAID THEY WOULD 
NOT HAVE A CHINESE RIDER 
I THINK 
THERE WOULD TRY IT WILL BE TESTED 
IN EUROPE FIRST 
BUT TALKING ABOUT 
A HALL OF FAME BEHIND THE THING 
LIVING LEGENDS A GREAT START OF 
BACKERS 
THE ONLY MAN WHO HAS WON BACKERS ON TWO WHEELS AND FOUR WHEELS 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS MICHAEL MICHAEL SCHUMACHER IS RACING IN THE GERMAN 
SYBARITE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
SUPERBIKE 
CASES TO A DOES NOT WANT TO SPEAK 
AT THE MOMENT WHAT HAPPENED 
CASEY STONER 
HE HAD AN ENGINE 
PROBLEM IT CAN HAPPEN 
UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS RACING HE HE SEEMED TO BE STRUGGLING TO KEEP THE 
PACE IN THE FRONT BEFORE THE ENGINE 
PROBLEM 
YES WE WILL HAVE TO INVESTIGATE 
BUT THE BRIGHT SIDE OF THE FRONT 
TYRE HAD SOMETHING WRONG THE 
RIGHT SIDE HE HAD TO KEEP THE BIKE 
UP WITH HIS KNEE IT IS VERY 
STRANGE THESE PLAYERS HAVE BEEN 
ABLE TO DO MORE ON THE RACE 
DISTANCE IN PRACTICE BUT IT WAS 
NOT AWARE THAT THERE 
LOOKING TO 
BOUNCE BACK IN ITALY IN A COUPLE OF 
WEEKS 
YES EVERYBODY WAS WEEKS COMPLAINING ABOUT HIM DOMINATING 
LAST YEAR SO WE ARE MAKING IT MORE 
INTERESTING THIS YEAR HE HAS 
PROVED THAT HE IS ABLE CHAMPION 
WORLD CHAMPION HE DESERVES ALL THE 
BEST BUT TODAY WAS NOT OUR DAY 
IT WAS NOT HIS DAY BUT IT IS 
LEAVING HIM THIRTY EIGHT POINTS OFF THE TOP 
OF THE TITLE WHICH IS A LOT 
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN BUT ON THE 
UPSIDE IT IS THE FIRST TIME THEY 
BEAT CASEY STONER 
DE TROUBLE FOR 
HIM IS IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT 
BECAUSE THE GUYS AT THE FRONT ARE 
REALLY ON FORM 
DANI PEDROSA IS DID YOUR PICK TO 
WIN RACES 
YES ONE WAS THE LAST 
TIME WE SOUGHT TO CATTY START WE 
SAW DUCATI LAST YEAR CASES TURNER 
COULD NOT DO ANYTHING WRONG BUT IT 
IS GOING WRONG FOR HIM THIS YEAR 
CASEY STONER IT IS ALL ABOUT PEAKS 
AND TROUGHS HE KNOWS ABOUT 
EVERYTHING 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE EVERYTHING CHAMPIONSHIP IN A WHILE BUT BEFORE 
WE DO IT WAS QUITE A NOSTALGIC 
TIME RECENTLY AT BROOKLANDS WHERE 
THE FIRST G. P. HAPPENED 
I WAS LIKE A 
DOG IN A BUTCHER'S SHOP 
AT IT WAS 
EXTRAORDINARY 
WELCOME SORRY'S BEST MOTOR RACING 
SECRET THIS USED TO BE A MAKER OF 
ENERVATION AND ENGINEERING IN YEARS 
GONE BY BUT I AM HERE FOR THE 
MOTORCYCLE CENTURY TO CHECKOUT THE 
GOOD OLD DAYS 
ONE HUNDRED 
AGO THIS HELP THE WORLD'S FIRST 
CLOSED CIRCUIT MOTORCYCLE RACE 
THIS WAS WHERE WORK THIS WAS 
WHERE MOTOGP BEGAN IT WAS KNOWN AS 
THE ASCOT OF MOTORSPORT THE PLACE 
TO BE SEEN AND A HOTBED FOR THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF BIKES CARS AND 
FLYING MACHINES BUILT IN NINETEEN OH SEVEN THE 
CIRCUIT WAS MADE UP OF TWO LONG 
STRAIGHTS AND WAS THE EPITOME OF 
SPEED THE CAMPBELL PART WAS ADDED 
IN NINETY PER TO SEVEN TO ADD AN 
ELEMENT OF ROAD RACING BUT THE 
MOST DAUNTING PART WAS THE BANKING 
NINETEEN OH SEVEN 
LOOK AT THIS THIS IS THE STEEPEST 
PART OF THE TRACK FORTY DEGREES CAN 
YOU BELIEVE IT IT IS THIRTY F. T. HIGH 
WHO ATE ALL THE PIES DOUBLE DECKER 
BUSES ONE HUNDRED F. T. ACROSS AND ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
AGO THEY WERE COMING THROUGH HERE 
ON THINGS THAT WERE LIKE BICYCLES 
WITH AN ENGINE IN GIVING ONE HUNDRED MILES 
AN HOUR A WHERE NUTS ONE OF THOSE 
MEN WHO BRAVED THE BANKING WAS 
DENNIS LOVEDAY WHO RACED THERE IN 
THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
IT ALSO VAST IT WAS FRIGHTENING 
IT WAS SO VAST THE TRACK WAS 
TERRIBLY BUMPY VERY ROUGH 
IT IS UNBELIEVABLE THAT ONE MAN 
CAME ALONG MANY YEARS AGO AND HE 
HIRED A BIKE DID HIS LAP GOT HIS 
GOAL START AND WENT HOME THAT WAS 
THE PRESTIGE 
THIS IS PRETTY MUCH 
WHERE IT STARTED THIS IS THE 
ACTUAL BIKE THAT WON THE NINETEEN OH EIGHT RACE 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IT IS JUST 
LIKE A BICYCLE WITH A BICYCLE 
BREAKS HERE BICYCLED FORKS NO 
SUSPENSION THE ENGINE IS MADE BY 
PEUGEOT ONE THOUSAND C. C. NO CLUTCH NO 
GEARBOX BELT DRIVEN MOVE INTO THE 
BACK NO SUSPENSION ONCE MORE 
ABSOLUTELY RIGID WHEN YOU LOOK 
AROUND THIS SIDE THIS IS WHERE IT 
GETS INTERESTING THE ADVANCE AND 
RETARD SYSTEM MAKING IT GO FASTER 
OR STRONG SLOWER THIS IS THE 
THROTTLE MOVE IN THE BUTTERFLY 
INSIDE THE CLUTCH YOU HAD TO PUMP 
THAT TO PUT OIL INTO THE ENGINE 
THERE IS THE FRONT BRAKE LEVER AND 
THIS IS THE COMPRESSION SYSTEM THE 
WINNER OF THE RACE WHO WON BY HALF 
A MILE GOT TWENTY SOVEREIGNS IF YOU 
GOT YOUR HEAD DOWN TOO FAR YOU HIT 
THE COILS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
SWITCH ON THE BIKE IS THAT BECAUSE 
IT TURNED IT OFF THAT IS THE ONLY 
WAY YOU COULD STOP IT IS BEAUTIFUL 
BUT THANK GOODNESS I DID NOT HAVE 
TO RAISE IT RACE IT 
AND THIS IS THE TESTING HILL A 
WHETHER YOU CAN GET UP OR NOT HE 
CANNOT SHALL WE DO IT AGAIN 
MOST GOT UP THERE IN THE END NOW 
IT WAS MY TURN TO GET ON A VERY 
SPECIAL BIKE ALL THE GEAR NO IDEA 
THIS IS THE BIKE I HAVE BEEN 
ENTRUSTED WITH RIDDEN IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE BY A 
NINE TIMES MORE CHAMPION THE WAS A 
LEGEND THE EQUIVALENT OF VALENTINO 
ROSSI THIS IS A HONDA IT ROSE TO 
FOURTEEN THOUSAND R. P. M. IT IS WORTH TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
IT IS INCREDIBLE VERY TINY AND 
SMALL AND I WILL RIDE IT UP THE 
HILL 
FANTASTIC EVEN THAT FELT 
INCREDIBLY BUMPY ROUND THE TRACK 
BUT IT WAS LIKE WITH NO 
SUSPENSION EVERY TIME I WENT UP 
THE HILL EVERYBODY WAS HOLDING 
THEIR EARS THE NOISE WAS 
UNBELIEVABLE I HAVE JUST WRITTEN A 
PIECE OF HISTORY TALKING OF 
HISTORY THE CROWDS WATCHING WERE 
TREATED TO THE RE ENACTMENT OF THE 
NINETEEN OH EIGHT RACE FULL OF PRE NINETEEN TWENTIES BIKES 
EVERYONE GOT TO RIDE THE CAMPBELL 
PART OF THIS CIRCUIT WHERE I PUT 
THE HONDA THROUGH ITS PACES JUST 
BRILLIANT 
WHAT THE DAY I HAVE HAD I HAVE 
RIDDEN THE T. T. WINNING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY HONDA A 
NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR A J. S. I HAVE NOT SEEN ONE 
BIKE WITH A LAPTOP AT DINNER NO 
SPARE WHEELS A FEW MORE BROLLY 
DOLLARS AND IT COULD NOT GET ANY 
BETTER 
WAS THAT YOUR AUDITION TAPE FOR THE 
ANTIQUES ROADSHOW 
IT PROBABLY WAS 
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY EVEN 
VALENTINO ROSSI WOULD BE ENVIOUS OF 
ME FANTASTIC 
HE ONLY WENT THERE 
TO MAKE HIMSELF FEEL YOUNG 
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
IT LOOK LIKE 
GREAT FUN 
YES LOVELY AND TO SEE 
SOME OF THOSE OLD GUYS THIS IS 
WHERE IT ALL STARTED THE THE TECHNOLOGY NOW IS UNRECOGNISABLE 
COMING FROM THE WAY THOSE BIKES 
WORK AND HOW BUMPY THEY MUST HAVE 
BEEN 
I THINK LORENZO WOULD HAVE BEEN LOVED IT 
THAT IS MY IDEA OF 
BICYCLE THAT IS WHAT I AM GOING TO 
WRITE THE DAY AS CHAMPIONS ON ONE ONE NOT RIDE ON A TANDEM BIKE SURE WE 
GET INTO SOME STANDINGS VALENTINO 
ROSSI HAS WON THE FRENCH GRAND PRIX 
IN ABSOLUTE STYLE HE WON BY A 
LARGE MARGIN HE ASTONISHED 
EVERYBODY WITH THAT MARGIN 
TERRIFIC THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE 
SO THE TYRE MAKERS ARE HAPPY AND 
YAMAHA ARE HAPPY THEY GOT A TOP 
THREE LORENZO IS VERY HAPPY HE 
HAS TWO BROKEN ANKLES AND WE ARE 
HAPPY FOR COLIN HE GOT ON THE 
PODIUM REALLY CLOSE AT THE TOP AS ABOLISHING IT IS ASTONISHING 
YOU HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS 
COMING INTO PLAY VALENTINO ROSSI 
GREAT ALL OVER COLIN EDWARDS 
MANAGING THE BIKE THROUGH THE RACE 
LORENZO COMING OUT OF NOWHERE AND 
CASEY STONER WHO FINISHED SIXTEENTH 
SHOVELLED PACK AND KEPT EVERYBODY 
HONEST YOU HAVE THIS FOUR WAY 
TUSSLE SO THAT IS WHAT HAS TURNED 
THE WHOLE THING ON ITS HEAD THAT 
WAS A RACE LIKE WE HAVE NOT SEEN 
ALL YEAR 
HAVE THE FAB FOUR TURNED 
INTO THE THREE MUSKETEERS NO NO CASEY STONER WILL BE BACK 
MECHANICAL PROBLEMS YOU CANNOT 
LEGISLATE FOR THAT L. THINK DANI 
PEDROSA WILL GET STRONGER 
VALENTINO ROSSI IT WILL NOT BE 
EASY FOR HIM 
WHEN YOU WATCH HIM ON 
THE BRAKES IF YOU RIDE A BIKE YOU 
CANNOT BELIEVE IT 
THE STANDING 
ASTOUNDING DANI PEDROSA HAS WORKED 
HARD TO CLAW IT BACK BUT THERE IS 
NOBODY WHO CAN DO IT BETTER 
IF YOU 
HAD TO PUT YOUR MONEY ON SOMEBODY 
TO WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP WOULD YOU 
SAY DANI PEDROSA 
HE SAID DANI 
PEDROSA WOULD WIN TODAY 
IT IS LIKE 
BEING A SCHOOL MISTRESS HERE IT 
WILL CONTINUE IN ITALY THIS AS 
YOU CAN IMAGINE IN TWO WEEKS TIME 
ONE OF OUR FAVOURITE RACES IT 
ATMOSPHERE ITS ATMOSPHERE 
IT IS ALWAYS A CRACKING RACE 
VALENTINO ROSSI WILL WANT TO WIN 
IT IS HIS HOME RACE

DUNLOP WAS KILLED FOLLOWING A CRASH 
AT THE NORTH WEST TWO HUNDRED ON THURSDAY
