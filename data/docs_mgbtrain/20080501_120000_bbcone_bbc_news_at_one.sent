INFLICTED BY SUZANNE HOLDSWORTH 
THAT SHAE HAD REPEATEDLY RAMMED HIS 
HOED AGAINST WOODEN BANNISTERS AT

WE FIRST TOLD HER SHE WAS SO 
OVERWHELMED WITH EMOTION SHE WAS 
CRYING BUT SHE SAID SHE WAS 
RELIEVED

IT EXPLAINED A PREVIOUS INJURY LEFT 
HIM WITH A DROOPING EYE HE HAD 
BRAIN ABNORMAL TIS AND A A. B. 
NORMALITIES AND A PREDISPOSITION TO

MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE THERE'S 
STILL A CHILD STILL DEAD THIS THIS LUNCH TIME SUZANNE HOLDSWORTH

THE LATEST IN A NUMBER OF CASES 
INVOLVING CHILDREN WHERE MEDICAL 
EVIDENCE HAS PLAYED A FUNDAMENTAL 
ROLE THEIR RULING THE JUDGES SAYS 
AND WARNED THAT PARTICULAR CAUTION 
IS NEEDED WHERE SCIENTIFIC 
KNOWLEDGE MAY BE INCOMPLETE AND 
WHERE THERE IS A DANGER THAT IT MAY 
BECOME OUTDATED 
A LODGER WHO LIVED AT THE HOUSE OF 
JOSEF FRITZL WHO IMPRISONED HIS 
DAUGHTER IN A CELLAR BENEATH HIS 
HOUSE FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS HAS SUGGESTED 
HE WAS NOT WORKING ALONE ALFRED 
DIVANOVSKY LIVED WITH THE FRITZL 
FAMILY FOR TWELVE YEARS HE CLAIMS HE 
SAW ANOTHER MAN ENTER THE BASEMENT 
WHERE FRITZL'S DAUGHTER AND 
CHILDREN HE HAD TO HER WERE KEPT 
PRISONER FROM AMSTETTEN IN AUSTRIA 
STEVE ROSENBERG REPORTS 
HE HAD LOCKED UP HIS OWN DAUGHTER 
IN LAW HIS CELLAR BUT JOSEF FRITZL 
WAS SO CONFIDENT HIS SECRET HAD 
BEEN BURIED UNDERGROUND THAT UP 
STAIRS HE TOOK IN LODGERS FOR TWELVE 
YEARS ALFRED DIVANOVSKY RENTED A 
ROOM IN FRITZL'S HOUSE 
SUCH A STRANGE GUY NONE OF THE LODGERS WAS ALLOWED 
INTO THE CELLAR OR ALLOWED TO TAKE 
PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE GARDEN AREA HE 
SAID THE CELLAR WAS HIS PRIVATE 
AREA AND HE DIDN'T WANT ANYONE 
THERE ONLY HE ALONE WAS LOUD TO GO 
INTO THE CELLAR HE WENT THERE 
ALMOST EVERY DAY THE I THOUGHT IT 
WAS A BIT STRANGE BUT DIDN'T FIND 
IT SUSPICIOUS 
DID YOU EVER SEE 
ANYONE ELSE GOING DOWN TO THE 
CELLAR 
HE DIDN'T GET 
MANY VISITORS SOMETIMES RELATIVE 
ORS FRIENDS WOULD COME TO THE HOUSE 
BUT ONCE FRITZL INTRODUCED HE TO A 
PLUMBER AND HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO 
DOWN TO THE CELLAR 
IN THE TWELVE YEARS 
YOU LIVED IN THAT HOUSE DID YOU 
NOTICE ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS 
BELOW MY ROOM A KIND OF BANGING BASHING KNOCKING 
NOISES ONE TIME I ASKED FRITZL 
WHAT IT WAS AND HE SAID IT WAS THE 
GAS HEATING ONE OF THE OTHER 
LODGERED SAID SHE SAW FOOD BEING 
TAKEN DOWN I DIDN'T SIGH THAT 
ALFRED DIVANOVSKY SAID ONE 
CONVERSATION IN PARTICULAR WITH HIS 
LANDLORD HAD STUCK IN HIS MIND HE 
SAID JOSEF FRITZL TOLD HIM ONE DAY 
HIS HOUSE WOULD GO DOWN IN HISTORY 
NEARLY ONE YEAR AFTER MADELEINE 
MCCANN WENT MISSING FROM THE RESORT 
OF PRAIA D. A. LUZ IN THE ALGARVE HER 
PARENTS KATE AND GERRY SAY THEY 
HAVE TO BELIEVE SHE CAN STILL BE 
FOUND ALIVE THEY'VE BEEN SPEAKING 
TO THE B. B. C.'S HUW EDWARDS ABOUT THE 
PORTUGUESE POLICE INVESTIGATION AND 
ABOUT HOW THEY CAN'T GIVE UP ON 
MADELEINE 
HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN THE MADELEINE HOPE THAT YOU MIGHT FIND HER ALIVE 
AND WHAT KEEPS THAT HOPE IN PLACE 
NUMBER ONE MADELEINE IS SO 
IMPORTANT TO US AND TO SEAN AND 
EMILY NUMBER TWO THERE IS NO 
EVIDENCE ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE 
THAT ANY HARM HAS COME TO HER AND 
THREE IF YOU LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE 
THE STATES WHERE THEY HAVE A LOT 
OF STATISTICS RELATE TO GO THIS 
KIND OF CRIME RELATING TO THIS 
KIND OF CRIME CHILDREN ARE 
RECOVERED A LOT OF CHILDREN ARE 
RECOVERED AND THE YOUNGER THE CHILD 
THE BETTER THE CHANCE OF THAT THEY THEY WENT ON TO EXPLAIN THAT ONE OF 
THEIR PRINCIPAL AIMS IS TO HAVE A 
EUROPE WIDE ALERT SYSTEM 
ON THE 
NIGHT WE SAID HAD THE LORD BORDERS 
BEEN ALERTED AND THE PORTS YOUR 
WORRY IS THAT CHILD WILL BE MOVED 
FAR AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF THE 
CRIME SO CLEARLY THE IDEA OF AN 
EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM IS THERE WE 
STARTED RESEARCHING AND HEARD ABOUT 
THE AMBER ALERT IN THE U. S. AND HOW 
EFFECTIVE IT'S BEEN THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE CHILDREN 
HAVE BEEN RECOVERED AS A RESULT OF 
THAT ALERT SYSTEM 
KATE AND JERY 
MCCANN ARE STILL OFFICIAL SUSPECTS 
AND YET SAY THEIR CONTACT WITH THE 
PORTUGUESE POLICE IS ALMOST NON 
EXISTENT 
WE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE EXISTENT TO KNOW WHAT'S BEEN DONE WHO HAS 
BEEN ELIMINATED ON WHAT GROUNTS 
AND WHAT LEADS ARE BEING 
FOLLOWINGED 
THIS IS CRIME A FOLLOWINGED HOFPBG CRIME AGAINST A YOUNG CHILD 
I THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT 
MADELEINE IS STILL MISSING AND A 
HIDEOUS CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED 
THAT PERSON IS STILL OUT THERE 
WHAT IS THE MESSAGE YOU ARE GIVING 
ON THIS FIRST ANNIVERSARY THE THE MESSAGE IS MADELEINE IS STILL 
MISSING AND SHE NEEDS TO BE FOUND 
I GUESS WE ARE URGING PEOPLE TO 
HELP US L. KNOW PEOPLE HAVE HELPED 
US FROM DAY TO DAY ONE BUT WE 
STILL NEED THAT HELP AND MADELEINE 
NEEDS THAT HELP WE NEED THAT CEBIT 
OF INFORMATION 
WHAT THE MCCANNS 
HOPE IS THAT THE INTENSE MEDIA 
PRESSURE ON THEM WILL SUBSIDE AFTER 
SATURDAY'S ANNIVERSARY ALLOWING 
THEM TO FOCUS ONCE AGAIN ON THE 
ONLY THING THAT MATTERS 
WE'LL NEMP 
GIVE UP ON MADELEINE L. WANT 
MADELEINE BACK WE NEED TO FIND 
MADELEINE THAT'S WHAT KEEPS US 
GOING GOING YOU CAN SEE MORE OF THAT INTERVIEW 
WITH KATE AND GERRY MCCANN LATER ON 
THE B. B. C. NEWS CHANNEL AT ONE THIRTY P. M. 
THE NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO DIE FROM 
HEART DISEASE HAS BEEN FALLING FOR 
SEVERAL DECADES BUT RESEARCHERS 
HAVE FOUND FOR WOMEN UNDER FIFTY THE 
RATE IS LEVELLING OFF THE FINDINGS 
COME FROM OXFORD AND LIVERPOOL 
UNIVERSITIES EXPERTS THINK THE 
TREND FORM THIS PLATEAU AMONG 
YOUNGER WOMEN IS CAUSED BY 
INCREASING RATES OF OBESITY AND 
DIABETES AND A LACK OF EXERCISE 
ALONG WITH MY SMOKING RATES 
HIGH SMOKING RATES 
PREPARE TO GO ASSESS PATIENT FOR 
HEART DISEASE AT THIS HEART 
CATHETER LAB IN SHEFFIELD THE 
CARDIAC CONSULTANT IS ABOUT TO 
CHECK THE HEART OF A WOMAN OF JUST 
FORTY FIVE SUFFERING FROM CHEST PAIN SHE 
IS SUSPECTED OF HAVING HEART 
DISEASE HERE A DYE SIN JECTED TO 
DETECT ANY BLOCKAGES THE DOCTOR 
SAYS HE IS SEEING TREND OF 
YOUNGER AND YOUNGER PEOPLE 
PRESENTING WITH THE DISEASE 
I AM 
WORRIED BECAUSE THIS GENERATION OF 
YOUNGER MEN AND WOMEN WILL HAVE 
MORE AND MORE PROBLEMS IN THE 
FUTURE THAT PROBLEM WILL MAGNIFY 
ITSELF AS THIS GROUP OF PATIENTS 
GETS OLDER 
IT IS WOMEN UNDER FIFTY 
WHO GIVE MOST CAUSE FOR CONCERN IN 
TODAY'S REPORT WHILE DEATHS FROM 
HEART DISEASE ARE FALLING IN ALL 
OVER AGE GROUP IT'S FIGURES HAVE 
LEVELLED FOR YOUNGER WOMEN THIS 
PATIENT IS TYPICAL OF THAT GROUP 
THIS LADY HAS THREE KEY FACTORS 
WHICH PUT HER AT GREATER RISK OF 
HEART DISEASE DIABETES HIGH 
CHOLESTEROL AND SHE'S BEEN AROUND 
HERSELF SMOKERS ALL HER LIFE SHE 
IS SURPRISED SHE MAY HAVE HEART 
DISEASE SO YOUNG 
I DON'T DRINK I 
DON'T SMOKE I WALK I'M FIT MY 
DIET'S PROBABLY NOT GOOD BUT I'M 
NORMALLY GENERALLY VERY FIT 
IT IS 
A BIG SURPRISE ISN'T IT 
YES SO IF 
IT CAN HAPPEN TO SOMEBODY WHO DON'T 
SMOKE I'VE NEVER SMOKED IN MY LIFE 
TODAY'S REPORT WARNS IF THIS TREND 
IS 
IT IS WHAT WE MIGHT ANTICIPATE THE THE FACTS ARE OUT THERE WHICH IS ONE 
GOOD THING WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE 
EDUCATION TO REMIND PEOPLE AND 
CONVINCE PEOPLE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO 
BE THIS WAY 
PARTICULARLY FOR WOMEN 
IT'S IMPORTANT THEY REALISE THEY 
ARE AT RISK OF HEART DISEASE 
THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO DIE OF HEART 
DISEASE THAN ANYTHING ELSE 
INCLUDING CANCER YOUNGER WOMEN ARE 
SETTING PATTERNS OF LIFESTYLE IN 
THEIR TWENTIES AND THIRTIES THEY WILL 
CONTINUE FOR THE REST OF THEIR 
LIVES THEY DON'T APPRECIATE THAT 
THOSE LIFESTYLE PATTERNS SMOKING 
AND NOT TAKING EXERCISE ARE SETTING 
THEM ON A PAST WAY TOWARDS HEART 
DISEASE 
PROFESSOR THANK YOU VERY DISEASE MUCH DISEASE MUCH MUCH NOW DON'T BE OVERCAUTIOUS THE 
MESSAGE FROM THE BANK OF ENGLAND TO 
HIGH STREET BANKS WHO HAVE CUT BACK 
ON LENDING TO PEOPLE OVER THE LAST 
FEW MONTHS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT 
TO LOSE MORE MONEY THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND SAYS IF MORTGAGES OR LOANS 
ARE NOT GIVEN TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T 
POSE A RISK THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
COULD WORSEN AND DELAY THE ECONOMY 
RECOVERY 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS POSING THE 
QUESTION HAS THE GLOOM GONE TOO 
FAR IT IS SAYING BANKS ARE TOO 
PESSIMISTIC ABOUT LIKELY LOSSES 
LINKED BACK TO THE U. S. HOUSING 
MARKET SLUMP THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
SAYS U. K. BANKS HAVE RISKY 
INVESTMENTS TOTALS AROUND ONE HUNDRED 
BILLION BUT THEY SHOULD NOT ASSUME 
ANYTHING LIKE THAT AMOUNT WILL BE 
LOST ITS FINANCIAL STABILITY 
REPORT SAYS PRICE IN THIS SOME 
CREDIT MACTS ARE SNOW LIKELY TO 
OVERSTATE THE LOSSES THAT WILL 
ULTIMATELY BE FELT BY THE SYSTEM 
WHAT'S THE KEY MESSAGE HERE WE 
ASKED A FORMER LEADING LIGHT AT THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND 
THE RISK THE BANK IS HIGHLIGHTING 
ARE THAT INSTITUTIONS MAY BE TOO 
RELUCTANT TO LEND AT THE MOMENT 
BECAUSE THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE 
PRICES OF THESE MORTGAGE ASSETS 
THEY CURRENTLY HAVE ON THEIR BOOKS 
AND THOSE PRICES MIGHT BE TOO LOW 
THEREFORE THE BANK IS NOW CHANGING 
ITS MESSAGE SLIGHTLY AND SAY TO GO 
PEOPLE YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BE BEING 
TOO CAUTIOUS AND PRICING RISK TO 
HIGHLY 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND WARNS HIGHLY THAT IF COMMERCIAL BANK GLOOM 
CONTINUES AND THEY RATION LENDING 
OTHER PARTS OF THE ECONOMY WILL 
SUFFER THE OFFICIAL BANK BASE RATE 
WAS RECENTLY CUT TO FIVE PER CENT BUT THE 
RATE AT WHICH BANKS LEND TO EACH 
OTHER KNOWN AS LIBOR IS MUCH 
HIGHER AT FIFTY EIGHT PER CENT BECAUSE THEY WANT 
TO HANG ON TO THEIR CASH THE 
RESULT IS ALREADY VISIBLE IN THE 
HOUSING MARKET IT IS HARDER TO GET 
A MORTGAGE AND MOST LENDERS HAVE 
PUSHED UP RATHER THAN CUT THEIR 
RATES RATES HOUSE PRICES ARE START TO GO FALL 
THE MARKET'S WEAKER THAN IT'S BEEN 
FOR A COUPLE OF DECADES THERE IS 
RISK THIS HOUSING WEAKNESS TURNS 
INTO ROUT IF THAT HAPPENS 
WHATEVER THE BANK OF ENGLAND SAYS 
MORTGAGES WON'T BE WORTH WHAT THEY 
WERE 
SO THE BANK OF ENGLAND MAY BE WERE HOPEFUL THAT THE WORST OF THE 
FINANCIAL MARKETS CRISIS 
THAT OTHERS MAY NOT 
SEE IT THAT WAY AND THERE ARE STILL 
RISKS TO THE HEALTH OF THE WIDER 
ECONOMY ECONOMY NINE TOURISTS HAVE BEEN KILLED 
AFTER A BUS OVERTURNED ON A DESERT 
ROAD IN EGYPT EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES 
SAY FOUR BRITISH TOURISTS ARE AMONG 
TWENTY EIGHT PEOPLE INJURED ALTHOUGH THAT 
HASN'T BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE 
FOREIGN OFFICE THE BUS WAS 
TRAVELLING FROM SHARM EL SHEIKH TO 
REQUIRE O. E. 
CAIRO 
ALL OF THOSE KILLED OR INJURED WERE 
IN THE SMALLER VESSEL CREWS OF 
PASSING BOATS HELPED TO PULL PEOPLE

NIGHT BECAUSE CHELSEA FANS HAVE 
BEEN CELEBRATING SOMETHING THEY'VE 
NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CELEBRATE BEFORE 
A PLACE IN THE FINAL OF THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
IN SOME WAYS THAT WAS THE EASY BIT 
THE CHALLENGE NOW IS GETTING TO 
RUSSIA AND GETTING A TICKET FOR THE 
MATCH THE MINUTE WE WILL BE

MOSCOW FIRST HERE'S ADAM PARSONS 
ON A NIGHT OF JOY AT STAMFORD

I CAN'T BELIEVE IT MATE SCRICTRY WE'RE GOING TO MOSCOW WE ARE GOING 
TO MOSCOW 
THEIR WIN INSTIGATED BY GOAL FROM 
DIDIER DROGBA THAT COMBINED 
OPPORTUNISM AND RAW POWER 
BUT THIS THE PIVOTAL MOMENT FRANK

TIME PENALTY TO PUT CHELSEA AHEAD 
AND RELEASE AN OUTPOURING OF 
EMOTION THEIR VICTORY SEALED BY

IT IS EXPENSIVE BUT IT'S A ONCE IN

WE WILL BE THERE 
THERE IS NO 
DEFINITIVE GUIDANCE FROM THE 
RUSSIAN EMBASSY ABOUT WHETHER FANS 
NEED A VISA 
THEY'RE ASKING FOR 
COPY OF YOUR MATCH TICKET TO 
ACCOMPANY YOUR VISA APPLICATION 
MANCHESTER UNITED ARE CLEAR AT THE

LAST NIGHT WAS A DEFINING EVENT FOR

PREPARED FOR US TO GET TOUGH ON YOU 
AT THE MOMENT THE RUSSIANS SAY

ZIMBABWE ELECTORAL COMMISSION 
SHOULD TODAY BEGIN VERIFYING THE 
RESULTS OF MARCH'S PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTIONS GOVERNMENT SOURCES HAVE 
SUGGESTED THAT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
HAS BEATEN ROBERT MUGABE BUT HIS 
LEAD IS NOT WIDE ENOUGH TO AVOID 
ANOTHER VOTE MR. TSVANGIRAI SAYS HE 
WON'T TAKE PART IN A RUN OFF THE 
B. B. C. IS BANNED FROM ZIMBABWE WE CAN 
TALK TO OUR CORRESPONDENT CAROLINE 
HAWLEY WHO IS IN NEIGHBOURING 
JOHANNESBURG JOHANNESBURG EXPLAIN THE PROCESS THAT WE ARE 
WAITING FOR HERE TODAY 
IT IS AN 
EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION IT IS NOW 
ALMOST FIVE WEEKS SINCE ZIMBABWEANS 
VOTED THERE IS STILL NO OFFICIAL 
PRESIDENTIAL RESULT BUT WHAT IS 
HAPPENING IS THAT THE ZIMBABWE 
ELECTORAL COMMISSION THAT HAS BEEN 
COUNTING THE VOTES BEHIND THE 
SCENES HAS CALLED IN THE FOUR 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES OR THEIR 
REPRESENTATIVES AND THEY THEN COME 
WITH THEIR OWN TALLIES THESE ARE 
TALLIES COMPILED FROM RESULTS THAT 
WERE POSTED UP AT POLLING STATIONS 
THE IDEA IS THAT EVERYONE TRIES TO 
REACH COMMON AGREEMENT AS YOU CAN 
IMAGINE IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW THEY 
CAN DO THAT I'D SAY EXPECT MORE 
DISPUTES AND DELAYS AHEAD THANK THANK YOU YOU POLICE HAVE TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT THEY 
BELIEVE BRITISH INVESTORS ARE BEING 
CONNED OUT OF AT LEAST HALF A 
BILLION POUNDS A YEAR BY WHAT IS 
KNOWN AS BOILER ROOM SCAMS THESE 
FRAUDS INVOLVE GANGS CONTACTING 
PEOPLE USUALLY OVER THE PHONE FROM 
ABROAD AND PERSUADING THEM TO 
INVEST THEIR SAVINGS IN SHARES 
WHAT THE PEOPLE DON'T REALISE IS 
THAT THE SHARES THEY'RE PUTTING ALL 
THEIR MONEY INTO ARE WORTHLESS 
SHARE INVESTMENTS ARE REGTDED BY 
THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY 
ITS HEAD OF ENFORCEMENT IS JONATHAN 
PHELAN PHELAN EASY TO THINK THAT IF WE GOT A 
PHONE CALL LIKE THAT THAT WE 
WOULDN'T FALL FOR IT BUT I GUESS 
THESE PEOPLE ARE EXTRAORDINARYLY 
PERSUASIVE 
OH YES THEY'RE TOO PERSUASIVE GOOD FOR THAT IT'S EASY TO FALL 
FOR THIS ONE IF YOU HAVE BOUGHT 
SHARES BEFORE THERE IS A GOOD 
CHANCE YOU ARE ON THE LIST FOR A 
BOILER ROOM AND THEY WILL GIVE YOU 
A CALL THEY WILL SOUND JUST LIKE A 
STOCKBROKER LIKE THE REAL DEAL 
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS YOU DIDN'T 
INVITE THAT CALL THAT IS THE WAY 
TO RECOGNISE THEM YOU DIDN'T ASK 
FOR THEM TO CALL YOU IF THAT 
HAPPENS YOU SHOULD BE REALLY WARY 
ABOUT DEALING WITH THEM IF IN 
DOUBT HANG UP THE PHONE MID 
CONVERSATION DON'T BE POLITE ABOUT 
IT IF YOU ARE TEMPTED AT ALL AND 
I DON'T ADVISE THAT YOU CAN CHECK 
WITH THE F. S. A. WHETHER THE FIRM WHO 
IS CALLING YOU IS AUTHORISED OR NOT 
IF IT'S NOT AUTHORISED PLEASE 
DON'T DEAL WITH IT HANG UP THE 
PHONE 
THAT'S A REALLY SIMPLE PHONE MESSAGE HANG UP BUT YOU CAN 
CONTACT YOUR ORGANISATION THAT IS 
ONE OF THE KEY THINGS YOU WOULD 
ADVISE 
INDEED WE HAVE A CONSUMER ADVISE CONTACT CENTRE AND A WEBSITE THAT 
WILL TELL YOU WHETHER THE FIRM THAT 
YOU ARE DEALING WITH IS NORISED OR 
NOT IF IT IS AUTHORISED THERE IS 
A COMPLAINTS' SCHEME YOU CAN USE 
IF IT'S NOT AUTHORISED THERE IS NO 
COMPLAINTS' SCHEME NO COMPENSATION 
SCHEME PLEASE DO CHECK WHETHER THE 
FIRMS YOU ARE DEALING WITH ARE 
AUTHORISED OR NOT 
JONATHAN PHELAN 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
IT'S WORTH TELLING YOU CAN SEE MUCH 
MORE ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF BOILER 
ROOM FIRMS IN TOMORROW'S EDITION OF 
WORKING LUNCH THAT'S ON B. B. C. TWO AT 
TWELVE POINT THREE OH ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY PROPERTY PRICES GOING DOWN THE 
STOCK MARKET IS JITTERY SO HOW 
ABOUT INVESTING IN GOLD BULLION A 
COMPANY IN NORTHERN IRELAND IS 
OFFERING SHARES IN TWENTY GOLD BARS FOR 
AS LITTLE AS FIFTY THERE IS A CATCH 
THOUGH AND IT'S QUITE A BIG ONE 
THE BULLION IS BURIED NEARLY FORTY 
METRES BENEATH THE SEA CHRIS 
BUCKLER EXPLAINS 
THE LAURENTIC LIES FORTY METRES BELOW 
THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND SHE 
STILL HOLDS THE PROSPECT OF GOLD 
WHEN THE SHIP SANK OFF THE NORTH 
COAST OF IRELAND IN NINETEEN SEVENTEEN SHE WAS 
CARRYING MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND GOLD BARS 
TWENTY OF THEM HAVE NEVER BEEN 
RECOVERED RECOVERED ON BOARD ANOTHER SHIP H. M. S. CAROLINE 
THE LAURENTIC WAS LAUNCHED AGAIN 
WITH PEOPLE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO BUY 
SHARES IN THE WRECK ALTHOUGH THERE 
IS LITTLE HOPE OF FINDING THAT 
REMAINING TEN MILLION FORTUNE IN 
GOLD BULLION 
IT'S NOT AN 
INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY ALTHOUGH 
LOOKING AT THE PRICES OF HOUSES 
THESE DAYS IT MIGHT NOT BE A BAD 
ONE IT'S A BIT OF FUN IT'S A BIT 
OF HISTORY IT'S A LOT OF THINGS 
ALL MIXED UP IT'S A CHANCE TO BUY 
INTO A DREAM TO ACTUALLY OWN A 
PART OF A WHITE STAR LINE THE THE LAURENTIC WAS BUILT HERE IN BELFAST 
AS A PASSENGER LINER BUT SHE WAS 
DRAFTED IN AS PART OF THE FIRST 
WORLD WAR EFFORT THE GOLD BULLION 
WAS BEING TAKEN TO CANADA TO HELP 
PAY FOR MEOW INITIALS WHEN THE SHIP 
HIT MINES THERE WAS A DREADFUL 
LOSS OF LIFE AND THE GOLD WENT DOWN 
WITH THE SHIP IN LESS THAN A 
DECADE ROYAL NAVY DIVERS RECOVERED 
ALMOST ALL OF IT BUT THE LAURENTIC 
STILL HOLDS A FASCINATION 
THE BOW 
IS STILL FULLY INTACT AND THE REST 
OF THE LAURENTIC IS JUST A 
SCRAPYARD BUT STILL EVERY DIVERS' 
DREAM TO DIVE IT YOU HAVE THAT 
BUZZ IT'S INCREDIBLE TO BE DOWN ON 
IT 
ON THE SEABED GOLD IS NOT THE IT ONLY ATTRACTION JUST ONE PART OF 
LAURENTIC'S RICH HISTORY THAT IS 
STILL BEING EXPLORED 
LET'S CATCH UP WITH THE WEATHER 
PROSPECTS WITH KIRSTY MCCABE 
WE'VE HAD MORE SHOWERS TODAY IT 
SEEMS LIKE ONE OF THOSE DAYS YET 
AGAIN AGAIN SOME SUNSHINE AROUND BUT STILL 
MORE SHOWERS AROUND AS WELL 
SOME OF THE SHOWERS PRETTY HEAVY 
WE'VE HAD SOME RUMBLES OF THUNDER 
MORE TO COME ACROSS THE SOUTH EAST 
AND IN EAST ANGLIA 
THERE WILL BE HAIL AND THUNDER TO 
WATCH OUT FOR 
IN BETWEEN THE SHOWERS SOME 
SUNSHINE AROUND SCOTLAND AND 
NORTHERN IRELAND ARE LOOKING AT 
HEAVY SLOW MOVING THUNDERY 
DOWNPOURS TOP TEMPERATURES AROUND 
TWELVE OR THIRTEEN DEGREES CELSIUS NOT GREAT 
FOR THE TIME OF THE YEAR I'M 
HOPEFUL THAT THINGS WILL GET WARMER 
LATER THIS WEEK 
ACROSS WALES A GOOD DEAL OF DRIER 
WEATHER JUST A FEW SHOWERS AROUND 
THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND WE ARE 
ALSO LIKELY TO SEE HEAVY DOWNPOURS 
HERE THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE 
SHOURKS IT'S HIT AND MISS IF YOU 
ARE LUCKY YOU MIGHT MANAGE TO 
AVOID THEM 
THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT MOST OF 
THE SHOWERS WILL FADE AWAY SO WE 
SHOULD SEE MORE IN THE WAY OF DRIER 
WEATHER OVERNIGHT WITH CLEARING 
SKIES AND LIGHTER WINDS 
WE ARE LOOKING AT LOWS OF FIVE TO 
SEVEN DEGREES CELSIUS 
TOMORROW FOR MOST IT WILL BE A 
FINE START TO THE DAY ENJOY THE 
MORNING SUNSHINE IT'S NOT LONG 
BEFORE THE CLOUD WILL BUBBLE UP 
AGAIN AND WE WILL SEE MORE SHOWERS 
DEVELOPING DEVELOPING NOT AS MANY SHOWERS AS WE HAVE 
AROUND AT THE MOPE 
A FEW HEAVY ONES AROUND ESPECIALLY 
ACROSS SCOTLAND 
TEMPERATURES ARE MOVING UP WE WILL 
SEE HIGHS OF FOURTEEN TO EIGHTEEN DEGREES 
CELSIUS CELSIUS THAT IS A THEME THAT IS SET TO 
CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND IT 
SHOULD BE WARMER BUT I'M NOT 
PROMISING WALL TO WALL SUNSHINE 
THERE IS MORE RAIN ON OFFER LOW 
PRESSURE IS MOVING INTO ATLANTIC 
THE WIND IS SOUTHERLY THAT MEANS 
MILDER AIR WE HAVE BANDS OF RAIN 
THAT WILL TRY TO MOVE FROM THE WEST 
THE WINDS WILL STRENGTHEN FOR A 
TIME WITH THE RAIN
