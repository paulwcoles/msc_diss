RYAN DAY PLAYED TERRIFICALLY WELL 
WE SAID EARLIER ON OR WE WERE 
WORRIED ABOUT THE TABLE BUT LET'S 
NOT TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM HIM HE 
PLAYED GREAT STUFF TODAY HE IS 
PLAYING THE CURRENT WORLD NUMBER 
ONE IT IS A FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE 
HE HAS BEEN BUBBLING UNDER YOU 
JUST THINK HE'S GOING TO WIN A 
TOURNAMENT SOONER OR LATER HER HER DIFFICULT A TASK WAS IT FOR STEPHEN 
HENDRY IN HIS MATCH IN CUT LIKE IT 
WAS GOING TO BE A TOUGH ONE 
AGAINST DING JUNHUI 
BUT HE CAN BE 
DELIGHTED WITH HIS PERFORMANCE HE 
CAN USE IT AS A SPRINGBOARD TO 
GIVEN A REALISTIC CHANCE OF HIS EIGHTH 
TITLE 
THE IS A BIG GOAL 
IF YOU TITLE GET HIS TAIL UP A COUPLE OF GOOD 
PERFORMANCES COULD GET STEPHEN 
HENDRY BACK TO RELAXED WAYS AND 
BELIEVES IN HIMSELF AGAIN 
HE IS IN 
THE QUARTERS FOR A RECORD SEVENTEEN NUMBER 
BACK TIME 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE IS PLAYING LAST 
YEAR'S PLAYER OF THE YEAR THE 
LEFT HANDER NEIL ROBERTSON 
THIS IS EXTREMELY UNUSUAL AGAINST 
A MAN OF ROBINSON'S QUALITY 
ROBERT AN'S QUALITY 
GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY IN A FEW 
MOMENTS WE WILL SHOW YOU SHOT 
THAT IS CRACKING EFFORT NEIL 
ROBERTSON PLAYED POT TOWARDS 
SAFETY PUT THE RED RIGHT OVER THE 
CORNER MAGUIRE PLAYED ONE KISS 
OVER THE OTHER AND HAS COME 
PERFECT ON THE BLACK THIS IS WHAT 
HE HAS GOT SO FAR HE HAS GOT THE 
BALLS IN A POSITION WHERE WE COULD 
BE SEEING SIX TO ZERO 
IT HAS NOT BEEN HIS DAY HE HAS NOT 
PLAYED WELL 
HE WAS A BIT ANGRY WE LOST THE FOURTH 
FRAME HE CRASHED HIS HAND ON THE 
WALL ON THE WAY OUT I DON'T THINK 
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THE FRUSTRATION 
WAS BEGINNING TO SHOW 
HE CAN BE PRETTY RELENTLESS AS A 
PLAYER STEPHEN MAGUIRE WHEN HE 
HAS BEEN GIVEN THE CHANCES 
HE HAS NEVER REALLY LOOKED LIKE 
MISSING 
HE'S JUST CHECKING THE SCORE WAS 
HE HAS A BIT MORE TO DO FOUR REDS 
LEFT 
HE HAS ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS SHOT 
HE REALLY HAD TO SCREW THAT HARD 
THE WAY IT WORKED OUT THE BLACK 
WENT IT WAS ON AT ALL TIMES THE 
PINK COULD HAVE CRASHED INTO THE 
BLACK BUT HE WOULDN'T HAVE 
DESERVED THAT THAT WAS A PRETTY 
CREATIVE WAY TO START A BREAK 
IT'LL BE THE BLACK AND A FURTHER 
RED NEEDED HE'S PILING ONE MORE 
AGONY FOR NEIL ROBERTSON 
VERY VERY WORRYING TIMES NOW FOR 
NEIL ROBERTSON WE MENTIONED THAT 
HE HAD TO WIN AT LEAST TWO OF THE 
REMAINING THREE FRAMES OF THE 
AFTERNOON SESSION 
YOU CAN COME BACK FROM A SIX TO TWO 
SCORELINE BUT A SEVEN TO ONE OR AT EIGHT TO ZERO IS 
A DISASTER 
HIS OPPONENT DOES NOT 
NEED ANY INVITATION NEIL ROBERTSON 
IS WELL AWARE OF THAT 
HE IS THE MAN IN FORM NOT MANY 
PLAYERS HAVE BROUGHT THEIR FIRST 
ROUND FORM INTO THE SECOND ROUND 
THIS YOUNG MAN SEEMS TO BE HITTING 
THE BALL AS GOOD AS ANYBODY COULD 
THIS BE A SECOND CENTURY 
THAT WAS A LOVELY SHOT NOW A GREAT 
CHANCE OF STEPHEN MAGUIRE'S FOURTH 
CENTURY OF THE CHAMPIONSHIPS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX WAS THE CENTURY EARLIER ON 
THE BOY IS IN FORM STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
PILING ON EVEN MORE PRESSURE TO 
NEIL ROBERTSON 
THIS CERTAINLY WASN'T IN NEIL 
ROBERTSON'S SCRIPT HE IS NOT 
HELPING HIMSELF 
ALL SEASON HE HAS 
BEEN STRUGGLING HE LOOKS A 
DIFFERENT PLAYER FROM LAST YEAR IT 
IS HARD TO PUT YOUR FINGER ON WHY 
YOU NEVER A GOOD SITTING IN YOUR 
CHAIR NEVER LOOKED GOOD YOU 
HAVE TO TAKE YOUR HAT OFF 
DOESN'T HELP NEIL ROBERTSON THE 
FACT THAT ACQUIRERS PLAY SO WELL 
IF YOU LEAVE HIM CHANCE HE MAKES 
THE MOST OF THEM IT MAY DEVISE THE 
PRESSURE EVERY CHANCE YOU GET YOU 
THINK HE IS NOT GOING TO MISS 
HOWARD USED CLOSER ONE LIKE THIS 
DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF A MATCH THAT DOES NOT WORK 
THE ONLY 
WAY TO 
SITTING IN THE 
CHAIR BY YOU POTTING 
SOME BALLS AT SOME STAGE IN 
THE GAME 
THE 
EMBARRASSMENT FACTOR BUILDS UP 
THE BIGGER THE GAP THE HARDER IT IS 
TO COME BACK IF 
FRAMES FOR 
ME OR THE MATCH IS OVER 
YOU DO NOT WANT THE SESSION WEIGHT 
WATCHER AT THE CRUCIBLE IT IS 
WHITEWASH 
NEIL ROBERTSON PROBABLY WHITEWASH THOUGHT HE 
FORM AND WAS LOOKING 
FORWARD 
GAME 
BUT HE 
IS BACK TO SQUARE ONE 
IT IS ALMOST REMINISCENT OF STEVE 
DAVIS OR STEPHEN HENDRY IN HIS DAY 
IT IS 
HARD TO PUT YOUR 
WHY YOU CAN 
CALL 
A PLAYER 
A 
BULLYING SORT OF PLAYER HE GOES 
INTO THE PACK EARLY HE HAS GUTS 
BUT 
WITH RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN 
NEVER 
FEEL LIKE 
YOU'RE BEING 
BULLIED BY HIM 
BUT WITH 
STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE 
STEPHEN HENDRY 
AND STEVE 
DAVIS YOU 
ARE ALMOST 
NOT GIVEN THE 
CHANCE TO PLAY 
I HAD SPOKE TO HIM 
AFTER HE LOST 
THE FIRST FOUR 
HE SAID HE HAD FORGOTTEN HIS HE HAD LEFT HIS SHOES BEHIND 
HAVING COME FROM CAMBRIDGE HE SAYS 
THE OTHER MOST UNCOMFORTABLE SHOES 
HE HAS EVER WALL IT IS NOT IDEAL 
SOME DAYS 
YOU JUST 
GET OUT 
OF BED 
THE WRONG SIDE HE IS OBVIOUSLY NOT 
HAPPY WITH THE SHOES OR NOT 
AT ALL 
HAPPY WITH THE SCORE LINE 
THE SHOES ARE VERY MODELLED FOR ME 
BUT THESE YOUNG LADS WHERE MODERN 
GAMES OF SHOES WEAR MODERN SHOES 
SOME THINGS WITH NEW SHOES YOU 
WOULD HAVE TO 
AND 
YOU COULD 
GET A 
BIT OF 
GRIP ON 
CARPET 
DON'T KNOW 
IF HE HAS DONE 
CARPET I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS DONE THERE GOOD OPENING POT 
ON A BAD DAY THOUGH YOU JUST HAVE 
TO KEEP PLAYING SAFE WE HAVE ALL 
HAD BAD DAYS AT THE OFFICE BUT 
HAS TO TRY AND MAKE SOMETHING OUT 
OF THE SESSION 
THAT LOOKS LIKE A GOOD SAFETY SHOT 
HE HAS 
COVERED THE 
REDS ON 
EITHER 
SIDE OF THE TABLE USING THE YELLOW 
AND THE BROWN L. WONDER IF HE HAS 
GOT A CLEAR SHOT AT ANYTHING NOT 
LOOKING GOOD HE CAN GET TO A 
COUPLE OF 
REDS BUT 
WHAT CAN HE DO 
WITH THEM 
HE CAN 
GET AN 
AGE TO 
PLAY THE SAFETY CAN'T GET AN 
EDGE 
HE MUST HAVE GOOD EYES HE HAS 
ALMOST HIT THAT TOOK THEM TOO 
THIN COAT OF PAINT JOB THAT THE THE RED HARDLY MOVED ONLY MOVED ABOUT 
HALF AN INCH HE HAS A 
CHOICE HERE 
BUT HE HAS TO 
DO 
CUE BALL WITH PINK AND BLACK BEING OUT OF PLAY 
IF THE BLACK 
WAS 
EITHER 
ONE OF 
THESE REDS WOULD BE 
NO PROBLEM IF HE TRIES TO POWER 
END HE HAS NOT HAD A GREAT LONG 
POT SUCCESS RATE 
POWER IT IN THAT IS THE PROBLEM 
PLAYING WITH POWER MAKES THE 
POCKETS THAT MUCH TIGHTER THE THE OTHER THING IS WE HAVE HAD 
SPECULATION ABOUT THE CUSHIONS 
BOUNCING SLIGHTLY THAT APPLIES TO 
THE JAWS OF THE POCKETS BECAUSE 
THEY ARE THE SAME CUSHION ROBBERS 
THAT SHORT ABSOLUTELY RATTLED IN 
THE JAWS CUSHION RUBBERS 
IS STEPHEN MAGUIRE GOING TO BE 
AGGRESSIVE HERE YOU BETCHA HE 
KNOWS THE BLACK IS OUT 
HE BRINGS 
THE REDS 
STRAIGHT INTO 
PLAY 
HE IS 
PROBABLY RELUCTANT 
PLAY HE IS PROBABLY RELUCTANT TO PLAY THE PINK AT 
THIS VISIT 
WILL 
TRY AND 
GET RID 
OF THE RED 
THAT IS ON THE PINK SPOT HE 
PROBABLY PLAY 
THE ONE 
TO THE LEFT 
OF THE PINK 
WILL HE BE RELUCTANT TO TAKE THE 
PINK AGAIN 
IT DEPENDS WHETHER 
THE 
PINK 
SPOT IS 
COVERED 
THE BLUE 
NOT BAD 
TO SCREW 
BACK IS 
TO TRY 
TO KISS ONE 
OF THOSE 
REDS AWAY 
FROM 
THE PINK 
SPOT TO 
MAKE THINGS EASIER THAT ONE SHORT 
HAS GIVEN THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
SCORE HEAVILY THE 
PINK IS 
ON TO AT 
LEAST THREE POCKETS 
A LITTLE SHAKE OF THE HEAD FROM 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE HE CANNOT QUITE 
GET 
TO THIS 
HE IS HAMPERED BY THE 
RED YOU CAN ALWAYS FLIPPED SOME 
SIDE 
ON THOSE SHOTS 
WHEN 
YOU ARE 
CUEING DOWN 
ON THE BALL IT IS 
MAGNIFIED BUT HE 
IS 
NOT HITTING 
THE BALL BADLY AT 
ALL SETTING 
THE STANDARD TODAY HE HAS A 
CHOICE OF 
TWO REDS TO 
FOR WENT TO THE RIGHT OF THE PINK 
HE DOES NOT LIKE EITHER OF THEM 
THE 
YELLOW IS 
JUST OFF ITS SPOT 
WHICH 
HELPS GIVING A 
ROOM TO HIT 
THE 
RIGHT HAND SIDE COMING BACK FOR 
THE PINK TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE 
THE FACT THAT THE YELLOW IS 
SPOT ANY THAT SHOT A LOT EASIER HE 
HAS PLAYED 
PURPOSEFULLY DOWN FOR 
HAS PLAYED PURPOSEFULLY DOWN FOR THESE THREE 
OR FOUR 
REDS HE 
CERTAINLY KNOWS HIS WAY ROUND EVERYTHING GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN 
HE CAN SEE ANOTHER X. REDS AND PINKS WHICH WILL BE ENOUGH TO WIN 
THE FRAME IT 
THE FRAME IT WILL BE COMPARATIVELY EASY TO GET ONTO THE PINK 
THE OTHER FACTOR TO CONSIDER IN 
THIS MATCHES THE HEAD TO HEAD 
RECORD HIS FIVE TO ZERO 
IN FAVOUR 
OF 
MAGUIRE NEIL ROBERTSON HAS NEVER 
BEATEN HIM 
BEFORE IT DOES 
PLAY A 
PART WHEN SOMEONE HAS SUCH 
SUPREMACY IN PREVIOUS MATCHES IN 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP QUALIFIERS 
A FEW 
YEARS AGO A 
COUPLE OF TIMES IN 
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THEY MET BUT ROBERTSON 
NEVER COME CLOSE TO BEATING HIM 
REALLY 
HE IS 
GOOD ENOUGH TO 
WIN 
NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT 
YOU CAN 
SEE HIM DOING A LITTLE OF MENTAL ARITHMETIC TO 
MANY REDS HE NEEDS WITHOUT 
MANY REDS HE NEEDS WITHOUT BRINGING THE BACK THE BLACK INTO PLAY HE CAN DO 
THIS WITHOUT 
BRINGING THE 
BLACK INTO PLAY 
HE TOOK THE RISK AND IT WAS A RISK 
HE MAYBE SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN HE 
COULD HAVE PLAYED 
FOR THE LOOSE 
RED BUT DECIDED 
TO TAKE THE 
HE HAS 
GOT A 
POT ON BUT IT IS 
HE HAS GOT A POT ON BUT IT IS MISSABLE 
HE MADE THAT SHOT LOOK EASY THERE 
WAS OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM WITH THE 
CUEING BUT MIRACULOUSLY HE COULD 
GET HIS CUE TO THE CENTRE OF THE 
WHITE BALL 
HE ALMOST JABBED AT IT 
DID 
NOT GO 
THROUGH THE BALL 
AFTER 
ALL AND PLAYED IT PERFECTLY 
HE PROBABLY HAD TO JAB IT BECAUSE 
THEY 
TWO REDS WERE 
THERE AND 
NOT WANT 
TO MAKE A 
TOUCH ONE OF THOSE WITH HIS CUE IT 
WAS A HARD 
PART BUT 
HE MADE 
EASY 
IT WAS LIKE 
HE WANTED TO 
THE CUE OUT OF 
THE WAY 
BEFORE HE 
HAD IT 
THIS IS BEGINNING TO LOOK VERY 
HONEST OMINOUS 
ONCE AGAIN THE FRAME IS LONG IT IS JUST QUESTION OF HOW MANY 
HE MAKES TWO CENTURIES IN 
SESSION AND 
THREE OTHER BREAKS OF 
SESSION AND THREE OTHER BREAKS OF FIFTY OR MORE 
HE HAS 
REALLY STARTED 
TO PEPPER AND WITH BREAKS PEPPER 
HIM 
HE CAN PLAY THIS THE STUN RUN 
THROUGH AND HALF BALL KISS ON THE 
BLACK THIS KISS COULD GO 
WRONG OF COURSE 
THIS KISS COULD GO WRONG OF COURSE MAKE NOT EVEN PLAY IT MIGHT NOT 
A BREAK OF SEVENTY NINE NO CENTURY BUT 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE WILL 
NOT BE 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE WILL NOT BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT 
MY GRANDPARENTS COULD NOT HAVE DONE 
ENOUGH FOR 
ME TO PLAY 
KNOCKED DOWN EVERY WALL 
IN THE 
UPSTAIRS OF THEIR 
HOUSE SO 
UPSTAIRS OF THEIR HOUSE SO THAT THEY 
COULD FIT THE 
SNOOKER TABLE IN 
FOR ME 
AND I WAS ONLY THIRTEEN I ALWAYS 
LOOKED UP 
TO THE 
LIKES OF 
STEVE 
LOOKED UP TO THE LIKES OF STEVE DAVIS AND THEY 
WERE THE 
DOMINANT FORCE AND 
THE GAME 
THEY HAVE NOT 
REALLY GOT 
THE GAME THEY HAVE NOT REALLY GOT A HERO AT THE MOMENT I HAVE NOT 
THESE DAYS IF 
YOU DO 
NOT PLAY WELL 
IT IS 
RARE THAT 
YOU GOING 
YOU 
GET THE 
ODD GAME WHERE 
BOTH 
PLAYERS PLAY IT 
BADLY BUT 
IT IS NOT 
PLAYERS PLAY IT BADLY BUT IT IS NOT THE 
SAME POWERS 
GOING IN 
DESTROYING 
KNOWING THAT YOU HAVE PLAYED REALLY 
WELL STEPHEN HAS JUST LEFT THE 
ARENA FOR A MOMENT 
THIS IS A 
ARENA FOR A MOMENT THIS IS A DEMOLITION JOB 
IT CERTAINLY IS 
FROM 
NEIL ROBERTSON'S PERSPECTIVE 
HE MUST HAVE 
BEEN LOOKING 
TO 
THIS MATCH 
TO 
THINK IT 
HAS BEEN 
EFFECTIVELY LOST AND 
THE 
EFFECTIVELY LOST AND THE FIRST SESSION 
IF IT GOES 
TO EIGHT ZERO IT 
IS ALL OVER YOU CANNOT SEE 
A WAY 
BACK IN FROM EIGHT ZERO YOU COULD 
FROM SEVEN TO ONE ALL THIS AND YOU SPEAK A 
HOPPING AS 
WELL 
THOSE SHOES MIGHT 
BE CONSIGNED TO THE THEN FOR 
THE 
BE CONSIGNED TO THE THEN FOR THE REST OF HIS CAREER THE BIN BUT 
THE ZERO IN THE FIRST SESSION THAT 
WILL BE DIFFICULT TO TAKE EIGHT TO ZERO 
ONE OF THE AMAZING STATISTICS WE 
HAVE BEEN PAST STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE GETS 
TO 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE GETS TO THE TABLE HE IS 
GETTING FIFTY 
OR 
PROBABLY ONE OF THE HIGHEST EVER 
THAT IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST SHORT 
NEIL ROBERTSON HAS HIT IN THIS 
SESSION SHOT 
THERE 
COMES A TIME WHEN 
PRESSURE FOR YOU LITTLE BIT 
AT SEVEN TO ZERO DOWN IT 
IS NEVER 
YOU CANNOT 
GO ANYWHERE 
BUT UP FROM 
YOU CANNOT GO ANYWHERE BUT UP FROM THERE 
FOR THE REDS FOR THE BLACKS HE 
WILL TRY TO 
SPLIT THE 
PACK BUT 
THAT PACK 
IS 
NOT PRETTY 
SCREWS OFF THE BLACK HE 
UP TIGHT 
TO THE BACK CUSHION HE HAS DONE WELL WELL CAP THE CUE BALL 
IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN COMING 
BACK TOWARDS 
CUSHION BUT 
IT 
CUSHION BUT IT FLIP AGAINST THAT OTHER RED HE'S HAD NOTHING WHEN 
YOU ARE 
SEVEN ZERO BEHIND 
NOT WANT TO BE PLAYING THESE SHORTS 
SAFETY SHOTS IT EASY WITH CLOSE TO 
THE RIGHT 
HAND POCKET HE 
CLOSE TO THE RIGHT HAND POCKET HE HAS 
GOT A 
THIN RED INTO 
THE LEFT 
HAND CORNER AS WELL WHATEVER HE PLAYS IT'S 
NOT EASY 
WHATEVER HE PLAYS IT'S NOT EASY HE IS TAKING 
ON THIS 
RED TRYING 
AVOID THE PINK 
BUT STAY ON THE 
AVOID THE PINK BUT STAY ON THE BLACK CAN HE GET 
ENOUGH PURCHASE 
ON CUE BALL TO 
MISS THE KISS 
ON THE PINK HE JUST CLIPPED THE PINK THAT 
PROBABLY TAKEN A LITTLE PACE 
OUT OF 
PROBABLY TAKEN A LITTLE PACE OUT OF THE CUE 
BALL THAT 
WAS CLEARLY A 
THE CUE BALL THAT WAS CLEARLY A GREAT SHOT NEARLY 
A BIT CLOSE 
TO THE CUSHION 
AGAIN EVEN 
IF HE 
TO THE CUSHION AGAIN EVEN IF HE POTS 
THIS BLACK THE 
NEXT RED IS 
POTS THIS BLACK THE NEXT RED IS NOT 
DRIVE THEM 
UP THE WALL MISSING 
DRIVE THEM UP THE WALL MISSING THAT HE HAS HIT 
THAT FAR JAW OF 
THAT POCKET AT 
LEAST THREE TIMES 
THAT POCKET AT LEAST THREE TIMES TODAY 
IT'S A TOUGH OPENER HE KNOWS THAT 
THE BLACK'S OVER THE POCKET 
HE COULD JUST PLAY ONE THEM 
IF HE 
WANTS TO OPEN THEM UP 
NOT BAD NOT THE BEST OF SHORTS 
THERE 
IS A 
REFLECTION OF 
THERE IS A REFLECTION OF HOW WELL STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
IS PLAYING 
HE IS 
UP TO 
NINETY FOUR PER CENT WHEN YOU 
ARE A TWENTY FOUR 
AFTER SEVEN FRAMES 
IT TELLS 
YOU HOW 
AFTER SEVEN FRAMES IT TELLS YOU HOW WELL YOU'RE PLAYING AT NINETY FOUR PER CENT 
THAT STATISTIC SHOWED 
US THAT 
NEIL 
THAT STATISTIC SHOWED US THAT NEIL ROBERTSON IS AT EIGHTY 
PER CENT WHICH 
THAT ONE 
IN 
THAT ONE IN FIVE CHANCES IS LEAVING STEPHEN MAGUIRE RIGHT AMONG THE 
BALLS AND 
HE IS 
SCORING 
BALLS AND HE IS SCORING SO HEAVILY IT 
IS NOT BEYOND 
THE REALMS OF 
IT IS NOT BEYOND THE REALMS OF POSSIBILITY 
THAT HE 
COULD 
WIN THE 
FRAME FROM 
HERE COULD THIS 
BE 
THE CLEAR 
OF ALL 
SESSIONS FOR 
ROBERTSON 
COULD THIS BE THE 
ROBERTSON COULD THIS BE THE NIGHTMARE 
I THINK HE PLAYED RIGHT IN BEHIND 
IT IF 
HE POTS 
THIS IT IS 
CUE BALL 
RIGHT AWAY FROM 
THE 
CUE BALL RIGHT AWAY FROM THE CUSHION ON TO THE BLACK IN THE 
SKIES DISGUISE THOSE FOUR REDS HE 
WOULD LIKE TO 
SHIFT BUT WHETHER HE HAS GOT 
SHIFT BUT WHETHER HE HAS GOT ENOUGH ANGLE TO PLAY WITH I THINK 
HE WILL SETTLE FOR 
THAT 
I THINK HE WILL SETTLE FOR THAT THERE 
IS A RED 
TO 
HAND POCKET WHICH YOU 
WOULD NOT BET 
AGAINST THEM 
POTTING HE 
AGAINST THEM POTTING HE STORMED INTO 
THOSE REDS SCREWING 
INTO THOSE REDS SCREWING INTO THEM WOULD HAVE SCREWED BACK OFF THEM 
HE STORMED STUNNED 
HE PLAYED THAT WITH A TOUCH OF 
RIGHT HAND SIDE 
THERE IS STILL A BIT OF WORK TO DO 
THERE IS 
A RED 
POTTABLE TO THE RIGHT CENTRE 
BUT THAT'S ANOTHER BREAK OF OVER THAT 
IS THE SEVENTH 
BREAK OF FIFTY 
OR MORE 
THAT IS THE SEVENTH BREAK OF FIFTY OR MORE IN 
THE MATCH WHICH SHOWS YOU 
THE 
IN THE MATCH WHICH SHOWS YOU THE KIND OF SNOOKER INCLUDING BREAKS OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY AND ONE HUNDRED TEN 
IF HE PINKS 
OR BLACKS HE WOULD NOT 
PINKS OR BLACKS HE WOULD NOT NECESSARILY NEED THIS DIFFICULT RED 
HE GETS THE 
IT IS A GREAT BREAK OF SIXTY SEVEN STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE SITTING HIMSELF HIGH 
STANDARDS HE WAS PRETTY 
FRUSTRATING FRUSTRATED AFTER 
MISSING IT WHAT CAN YOU DO THAT 
IS ABOUT ALL HE HAS MISSED IN THE 
MATCH COME ON STEPHEN THE GAME 
IS NOT THAT EASY 
THE KEY NOW FOR NEIL ROBERTSON IS 
KEEPING THE RED ON THIS SIDE OF THE 
TABLE 
HE MAY EVEN TAKE A CUT ON HE THOUGHT 
HE WOULD GO FOR THE CLIP HE HAD EVERY CHANCE OF KNOCKING THE BLACKS SAFE HE HASN'T SNOOKERED IT 
THAT IS A SHAME THE CHANCE HE HAD 
OF WINNING A FRAME HAS NOW GONE 
LOOK WHERE THE BLACK IS GOING TO 
FINISH 
THIS IS GREAT WHEN YOU WHAT IN 
FORM THIS GAME IS EASY 
UNBELIEVABLE 
THIS IS RELENTLESS SEVEN BREAKS OVER 
FIFTY INCLUDING TWO CENTURIES A 
MATCH FOR ANYONE THE WAY HE HAS 
PLAYED TODAY NEIL ROBERTSON IN 
THE EARLY PART OF THE MATCH COULD 
HAVE WON THREE OF THE FIRST FOUR 
SINCE THEN HE HAS NOT HAD MANY 
CHANCES TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST 
NOT MANY SESSIONS HERE AT THE 
CRUCIBLE HAVE ENDED EIGHT ZERO 
HE WON THE FIRST EIGHT AGAINST 
ANTHONY HAMILTON HE HAS WON THE 
FIRST EIGHT AGAINST NEIL ROBERTSON 
HE IS THE MAN IN FORM WITHOUT 
DOUBT 
HE WOULD HAVE WON THE SESSION BUT 
HE CERTAINLY HAD WHATEVER RUN THERE 
WAS GOING HE HAS TAKEN 
OF THE AFTERNOON SESSION 
AND THAT IS THE FORTY EIGHTH WHITEWASH IN A 
SESSION HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE THESE 
FELLOWS JOHN AND STEVE HAD 
INFLICTED TEN OF THOSE UPON 
UNSUSPECTING OPPONENTS WHAT DOES 
IT FEEL LIKE 
IT IS LOVELY YOU 
FEEL ABSOLUTELY INVINCIBLE AND YOU 
GET STRONGER BECAUSE OF IT IT IS 
LOVELY SHOVING THE BRIDGE IN 
WOULD YOU CAN OCCUR 
I WAS ON THE 
OTHER END OF HIM HE WAS PLAYING 
FANTASTIC AND BELIEVE YOU ME HE 
LOVED PUTTING HIS FOOT RIGHT ON 
YOUR NECK AND KEEPING IT THERE ON 
A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS I HAD THERE 
ARE TWO OTHER PEOPLE IT IS 
FANTASTIC YOU DON'T GET PAID 
OVERTIME GET IN WHEN THE MATCH 
GET OUT 
HAVE YOU COPE WITH IT FROM 
NEIL ROBERTSON'S WOULD HAVE YOU 
YOU GO BACK YOU SAY CANNOT GET 
ANY WORSE IT IS ONLY A GAME OF 
SNOOKER YOU COME OUT THE NEXT DAY 
TRY AND SHOW BIT OF PRIDE AND SEE 
WHERE IT TAKES YOU ONE FRAME AT A 
TIME THAT IS ALL YOU CAN DO 
IT IS 
OVER THOUGH 
YES AT LEAST YOU'RE 
NOT GETTING HE GOT A NOSE LIKE IN 
BOXING BUT HE WILL BE FEELING 
HORRIBLE IN THE DRESSING ROOM 
OBVIOUSLY LUBBOCK MIGHT BE DOUBT 
THAT IT WILL GO TO MONDAY AFTERNOON 
I THINK ISSUES WILL ALREADY HAVE 
BEEN PUT ON THE DAY TO SHOES 
ESAU ONE FOR NEIL ROBERTSON BUT 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE IS GOING TO FEEL 
GREAT TIME FOR SOME MORE SNOOKER 
TIPS FROM THE SHEFFIELD TRAIN 
STATION 
HELLO SIR WHAT'S YOUR NAME DO DO TONY I HAVE A QUERY ON MY CUEING 
ACTION 
SHE 
SHOW US THE PROBLEM ACTION SHOW WAS THE PROBLEM 
DEFINED THEIR 
DUTY TEND TO LET IT GO DO YOU 
FIND THAT YOU CAN TO LET IT GO THE THE ONE WORD YOU SHOULD NEVER USED HIS 
HEIGHT I DON'T LIKE THE WOULD GRIP 
IT SHOULD BE MORE OF A HOLD IT 
SHOULD BE ABOUT A FIVE TO SEVEN OUT OF 
NEVER MORE THAN THAT 
WOULD YOU 
NORMALLY FIND IS THAT PEOPLE WILL 
TALK ABOUT A GRIP YOU PICK THE CUE 
UP OF THE TABLE THAT WERE 
NATURALLY FORM YOUR GRIP IF YOU 
GRIP THE CUE IN THE RIGHT PRESSURE 
WHICH IS A FIVE OR SIX YOUR 
FINGERS NATURALLY GO AND THE CUE 
GOES INTO THE FRONT OF YOUR HAND 
AS IT COMES THROUGH IT GOES INTO 
THE BACK OF YOUR HAND THERE YOU 
SHOULD BE LEFT WITH A GAP THE THE SHOULD BE TOUCHING THE CUE 
MY DAD 
USED TO SAY IF YOUR KNUCKLES ARE 
TOO WIDE YOU'RE HOLDING IT TOO 
TIGHT 
SO NICE AND LEAST 
NICE AND LOOSE 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT THAT IS WHEN 
YOU TAKE THE CUE BACK THAT IS THE 
POINT YOU STOP NOW IT IS CAUGHT IN 
THERE AND THE THAT HAS FORMED THERE 
AND IT COMES BACK IT STOPS YOU 
FINISH EXACTLY THERE DID USE TORD 
GRIP HOLD THE CUE DON'T USE THE 
WORD GRIP 
YOU CAN DO IT WHEN EUROPE PRESSURE 
AGAIN YOU CAN GRIP IT TOO TIGHT 
END YOU MISS 
THING YOU DON'T GET 
ANY FLOW 
STEPHEN HENDRY USED TO 
SAY WHEN HE WAS UNDER MOST 
PRESSURE BUT HE USED TO GO 
STRAIGHT ON HOLDING THE CUE REALLY 
LIGHTLY LET'S HAVE A GO 
YOU ARE LEFT HANDED LET'S HAVE A 
LOOK AT THIS NICE AND LIGHT 
THAT IS O. K. TRY TO GET A BIT 
SNOOKER A BIT SMOOTHER 
NICE AND LIGHT JUST LET IT 
NATURALLY FLOW 
UNLIKE THE DENNIS 
TAYLOR'S GLASSES NO WIN NO FEE THANKS VERY MUCH 
SHAUN MURPHY SHOWING HIS COACHING 
PROWESS I'M NOT SURE ABOUT JOHN 
THE HAVE GONE TO GREAT EXPENSE 
HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT SO FOR IN 
THIS SERIES THE NUMBERS OF THE 
PUBLIC NOBODY HAS ACTUALLY POTTED 
A BALL 
THEY ONLY CAME FOR THE 
FIRST PART WHICH IS HOW TO GRIP IT 
HE HAD TO CATCH THE TRAIN TO 
DONCASTER OR 
AT LEAST YOU WOULD 
THINK SOME VERY WHAT GET IT WE WE WILL SEE IF SOMEONE CAN POT A BALL 
TOMORROW WE SAW SHAUN MURPHY'S 
COACHING PROWESS BUT A LOT OF 
SMART MONEY HAS BEEN AWAITED ON THE 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE WORLD CHAMPION COME INTO THIS 
YEAR'S CHAMPIONSHIP HE HAS BEEN 
PERHAPS THE MOST CONSISTENT PLAYER 
OF THE SEASON SO HE CAME IN HERE 
WITH A LOT OF CONFIDENCE BUT SO 
DID HIS OPPONENT ALI CARTER HE IS 
PRETTY CHILLED OUT ABOUT HIS OWN 
CHARGES THIS TIME OWN CHARGES 
THE FIRST YEAR I PLAYED PAUL 
HUNTER I MANAGED TO BRING IT ROUND 
BUT LAST YEAR WAS MY BREAK THROUGH 
GETTING THROUGH TO THE QUARTER 
FINALS UNLUCKY NOT TO GET TO THE 
SEMIS JUST GETTING PIPPED TO THE 
POST BY MARK SELBY THE FIRST MATCH 
AGAINST BARRY HAWKINS WE KNOW EACH 
OTHER WELL DIDN'T PLAY 
PARTICULARLY WELL IN THAT GAME AND 
NOR DID HE THREE TO ZERO DOWN THEN HE DID 
NOT DO MUCH AT ALL TURN ROUND A 
LITTLE BIT COME BEFORE WE KNEW IT 
IT WAS NINE TO NINE L. DIDN'T THINK I WAS 
GOING TO WIN AT THAT POINT BUT 
WHEN IT'S GOT CALLED OFF IT WAS TO 
MY ADVANTAGE L. WAS LUCKY TO CAPITALISE AND TAKE MY CHANCES 
SHAUN IS VERY CONFIDENT AT THE 
MOMENT THAT IS HIS GREAT STRENGTH 
HE HAS WON A TOURNAMENTS HE'S VERY 
HAPPY IN HIS PERSONAL LIFE I WOULD 
IMAGINE HE HAS EVERYTHING GOING 
FOR HIM HE IS YOUNG HE HAS IT ALL 
ON HIS SIDE THE ATMOSPHERE HERE 
AND THE TWO TABLE SET UP I HAVEN'T 
BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET DOWN TO 
THE ONE TABLE SET UP 
SHAUN MURPHY AND ALI CARTER BEGAN 
THEIR SECOND ROUND MATCH YESTERDAY 
ALI CARTER GOT OFF TO A FLYING 
START A BREAK OF NINETY SEVEN WAS BROUGHT TO 
A HALT BY THIS IN OFF 
THE CAPTAIN CARTER THEN TOOK A TWO 
ZERO LEAD WITH A BIT OF LUCK WITH 
THIS OUTRAGEOUS FLUKE 
YORKSHIRE BASED MURPHY ONE THAT 
THIRD FRAME BUT CARTER BUZZ MIGHT 
BREAK OF FIFTY SIX GAVE HIM A THREE TO ONE LEAD AT 
THE MET MID SESSION INTERVAL 
TWENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD CARTER THEN TOOK THE 
FIFTH FRAME BEFORE MATTHEW'S PAT THE 
CORNER ALSO GAVE HIM THE SIXTH 
MURPHY'S TACTICAL NOUS 
BREAKS OF FORTY FIVE AND FORTY ONE GAVE CARTER A 
FIVE TO TWO LEAD AND A CENTURY IN THE 
FINAL FRAME OF THE SESSION SEES HIM 
IN SIX TO TWO AHEAD WE'RE GOING TO JOIN THEM IN THE NEXT FRAME 
HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY A GOOD 
SHOT TO GET ON THE GREEN IN THE 
RIGHT CORNER THAT WAS A HORRIBLE SHOT 
HE GOT DOWN TO THE GREEN AND HAD 
DONE WELL TO DO THAT BUT THIS IS 
REALLY A TOUGH SHOT 
HE HAD TO ATTEMPT IT NICE SAFETY 
AVAILABLE NO SAFETY AVAILABLE 
CARTER'S TURNED TO HAVE A BIT OF 
GOOD FORTUNE 
THIS FRAME COMING UP TO TWENTY FIVE MINUTES 
IT IS THE SECOND LONGEST OF THE 
MATCH SO FAR IT IS A VERY GOOD TRY 
TIGHT UP AGAINST THE BLACK WOULD 
HAVE BEEN IDEAL THAT COULD HAVE GONE WRONG 
CERTAINLY TURNED OUT WELL FOR 
CARTER A FLICK SNOOKER HE FLUKE SNOOKER 
I WAS WONDERING WHY HE WAS TAKING 
SO LONG L. THOUGHT HE WAS TRYING TO 
DECIDE WHAT TYPE OF SAFETY SHOT HE 
WAS PLAYING BUT THAT LOOKS 
STRAIGHTFORWARD HE WAS ALWAYS 
GOING TO GIVE CARTER THE OPTION TO 
PLAY A GOOD SAFETY ON HIM 
WE WILL GIVE HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE 
DOUBT AND SAY HE PLAYED IT TO GET 
BEHIND THE PINK 
ALL THE WAY LESS 
CHARITABLE FORTY TRIED TO GET BEHIND 
THE BLACK ALL THE WAY LESS 
CHARITABLE THOUGHT HE TRIED TO GET 
BEHIND THE BLACK A FULL BALL SNOOKER 
HE WILL BE HOPING TO HIT THE GREEN 
AT THAT SORT OF ANGLE 
THE WAY YOU SUGGESTED WAS KNOCKING 
THE GREEN IT TOWARDS THE BLACK 
WITH THE BLACK COVERING THE POCKET 
THE WAY MURPHY CHOSE HAS LEFT THE 
GREEN ON 
A GILT EDGED CHANCE TO WIN THE 
FRAME NOW 
HE HAS LEFT HIMSELF A LITTLE MORE 
TO DO 
WELL WHAT AN IMPORTANT FAILURE 
THAT COULD TURN OUT TO BE IT 
LOOKED THE EASIEST THING IN THE 
WORLD 
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A FIGHT 
BACK 
HE HAS NOW PUT THE PINK SAFE HE TOOK THE CHANCE THEN OF PLAYING 
FOR SNOOKER OFF FOR BLUE FAIR 
WHICH I THINK WAS THE RIGHT SHOT 
HE WAS UNFORTUNATE TO CLIP THE PINK 
THE NURSE ON THE BLUE WAS EVEN 
WORSE THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS FRAME 
BALL THEN THIS ON THE BLUE THE MISS ON THE BLUE 
THERE HAS BEEN SOME GOOD STUFF IN 
THIS FRAME AND SOME VERY BASIC 
ERRORS FROM BOTH PLAYERS L. AM SURE IT WILL PICK UP AS WE GO ALONG CARTER HAS PLAYED THAT PERFECTLY 
THAT IS ONE OPTION I DON'T THINK 
HE HAS GOT THE SORT OF POSITION 
WITH A CUE BALL TO SCREW AROUND THE 
PINK AND BLACK EITHER SIDE 
HE IS ONLY NINE POINTS BEHIND SO HE 
POSSIBLY COULD ROLL UP THE FIRST 
TIME TO SEE IF YOU COULD JUST 
DROP ON THE BLUE IF HE HITS WITH 
PACE THERE IS NO GUARANTEE AS WE 
HAVE SEEN ON THE EARLIER GREEN HE 
PLAYED 
HE IS HAVING ANOTHER LOOK IF HE CAN 
SWERVE INSIDE THAT BLACK AND PINK PERFECTLY JUDGED 
IT HAS BECOME THE LONGEST FRAME OF 
THE MATCH NOW JUST COMING UP 
TOWARDS THIRTY THREE MINUTES NOT WHAT YOU 
WOULD EXPECT FOR TWO PLAYERS LIKE 
THIS WHO WAS VERY GOOD BREAK 
BUILDERS AND BOTH GET ON WITH THE 
GAME BUT IT IS THE ERRORS THAT HAVE 
PROLONGED THIS FRAME 
WELL AFTER ALL THE ADVENTURES AND 
MISADVENTURES CARTER NEEDS ONLY 
THIS BLUE TO GO FOURTEEN IN FRONT WITH 
ONLY THIRTEEN ON THE TABLE 
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A 
SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL BLOW FOR 
CARTER TO LOSE THIS FRAME 
UNLESS MURPHY GET THE SNOOKER HE 
NEEDS CARTER'S EARLIER FAILURE TO 
POT THE FRAME BALL BLUE WILL BE 
FORGOTTEN BY HIM 
HE ALMOST THREW THIS FRAME AWAY BUT 
AFTER THIRTY FIVE MINUTES PLAY HE HAS 
SECURED IT TO INCREASE HIS LEAD TO 
SEVEN TO TWO SEVEN TO TWO WELL SEVEN TO TWO BECAME EIGHT TO THREE AND NOW IN THE 
FRAME TWELVE IT IS THE MAN UNDER REAL 
PRESSURE HERE SHAUN MURPHY TO 
PLAY 
BEAUTIFUL THAT IS A BIT MORE LIKE 
WHAT WE EXPECT FROM SHAUN MURPHY 
WHEN HE TAKES ON THE DISTANCE POTS 
MR. A COUPLE OF LONG POTS IN THE 
LAST FRAME MISSED A COUPLE OF 
LONG POTS 
I CANNOT BELIEVE HE HAS MISSED THAT 
PINK THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK 
THERE IS THAT HE TOOK THE EYE OF 
THE POT LOOKING AT THE SPLIT HE 
WAS TRYING TO GET NO OTHER REASON 
THE ONLY SAVING GRACE THERE THE 
PINK HAS GONE SAFE AND IT HAS 
RESTRICTED CARTER'S ABILITY TO GET 
HIGH ON THE BLUE 
THE REDS LOOK PRETTY WIDE OPEN HE 
IS GOING TO NEED A GOOD FEW SHOTS 
HERE 
THAT WAS A VERY NICE STRIKER OF THE 
BALL HE MAY HAVE PLAYED FOR THE 
BLUE BUT WHEN HE COMES DOWN TO LOOK 
AT THE GREEN HE WILL NOTICE THAT 
THE YELLOW AND BROWN ARE IN THE WAY 
OF THE PATH HE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE 
TO COME BACK AND FOR THE RED 
BECAUSE OF THAT HE MAY HAVE TO POT 
THE BLUE 
IT LOOKED AS IF THE ODDS WERE IN 
HIS FAVOUR ABOUT GETTING ON RED 
IN THE END POTTING A DIFFICULT ONE 
IT WAS NOT ONE THAT HAD COME INTO 
HIS ORIGINAL CALCULATIONS 
AND HE 
GOT TO BOUNCE OF THAT BOTTOM 
CUSHION THEN CLIVE HE DIDN'T 
THINK HE WAS GOING TO BE ON THE 
SCREEN SOMETIMES THESE BOUNCERS 
CAN HELP THE PLAYERS THEY DON'T 
MENTION THAT BOUNCE SAYS 
CARTER WAS GIFTED THIS OPPORTUNITY 
BY NIFTY MISSING A PINK AT POINT 
BLANK RANGE BY MY FEET MISSING PINK 
WE ARE NOT GOING TO SEE ME IF THE 
MISS MANY OF THOSE MURPHY 
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH HE IS GOING TO 
DO ENOUGH TO WIN THE FRAME THIS 
SESSION COULD HAVE GONE FOUR TO OH TWO EITHER 
PLAYER CLIVE 
FOUR TO ZERO TO EITHER PLAYER 
QUITE TRUE 
BUT THIS IS FRAME BALL FOR NINETY THREE FOR 
CARTER FORTY NINE TO THREE 
AGAIN NOT ALL THAT DIFFICULT BUT 
THE DIFFICULTY MULTIPLY IT BY ITS 
SIGNIFICANCE 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN NINETY THREE IT STILL COULD 
BE SHOULD HAVE BEEN NINE TO THREE 
THAT WAS VERY UNLUCKY AND OF COURSE 
HE CANNOT AFFORD TO GET AWAY FROM 
THE BLACK 
IT IS FUTILE TO SAY HE 
COULD AFFORD ONE PINK BECAUSE THE 
PINK IS ON THE SIDE CUSHION 
HE HAS LEFT HIMSELF AN ANGLE NOW 
OF THE BLACK NOT EASY 
A WINNING CLEARANCE STILL A 
POSSIBILITY BUT THE PINK COULD 
PROVE A MAJOR OBSTACLE 
HE WOULD 
LIKE TO GET THAT FAR WOULDN'T HE 
HE NEEDS THE BLACK AND A GOOD ANGLE 
OFF IT TO GET DOWN TO THE YELLOW 
WHICH IS NOT IDEALLY PLACED 
NOT A HUGE MARGIN OF ERROR FOR THE 
POSITIONAL SHOT FROM BLACK TO 
YELLOW 
UNDOUBTEDLY THAT IS THE BEST SHOT 
POSITIONAL WISE OF THE SESSION 
EXCELLENT SHOT 
SO CARTER IS HAVING TO PIN HIS 
HOPES ON THE PINK SHAUN MURPHY 
CONTINUES TO PURSUE WINNING 
CLEARANCE THAT HE SHOULD NEVER 
HAVE HAD THE CHANCE OF 
THAT IS NOT 
THE BEST SHOT HE HAS EVER PLAYED 
THAT HAS CUT HIS OPTIONS DONE HE 
COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT CUE BALL A 
COUPLE OF INCHES FURTHER DOWN THE 
TABLE 
I NEVER FANCIED THAT SHOT HE 
DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE THE ANGLE TO 
ACHIEVE IT 
NOT A CLEARANCE BUT RIGHT BACK IN 
CONTENTION CARTER MISSED FRAME 
BALL IN THE FIRST FRAME THIS 
MORNING BUT STILL MANAGED TO WIN IT 
HE HAS MISSED FRAME BALL IN FIRST 
FRAME AND STILL COULD LOSE IT MR. 
FRAME BALL IN THIS FRAME 
I MENTIONED EARLIER ON THAT I HAVE 
A PLAYER COULD HAVE WON THIS 
SESSION FOR ZERO BUT TWO TO TWO WOULD BE A 
PITY PRETTY FAIR OUTCOME CARTER 
WAS PLAYING HIS SAFETY THERE WITH 
THE SECONDARY SIDE OF THE SHOT 
TRYING TO NUDGE THE BLACK ON TO THE 
CUSHION BUT HE HAS GOT THE SAFETY 
NOT QUITE SURE IF SHAUN MURPHY CAN 
PLAY THIS SHOT 
GOOD SHOT THE WORST OUTCOME WOULD 
HAVE BEEN IF THE PINK CAN AND THE 
BLACK 
HOW 
AM NOT SURE OF THAT I BLACK AM NOT SURE OF THAT THERE COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE 
AND SO MURPHY HANDS THE FRAME TO 
CARTER VERY UNLUCKY GREAT POT 
BUT BY GIVING SIX AWAY HE NOW 
NEEDS SNOOKER IT IS GOING TO BE NINE TO THREE TO CARTER 
LAST YEAR SHAUN MURPHY PRODUCED ONE 
OF THE GREATEST EVER CRUCIBLE 
COMEBACKS WHEN HE WAS IN THE 
QUARTER FINALS AGAINST MATTHEW 
STEVENS IF ANYTHING LIKE IT IS 
GOING TO HAPPEN THE RECOVERY MUST 
START SOON THAT IS AMAZING 
THIS IS TURNING INTO A CHAPTER OF 
ACCIDENTSS FOR MURPHY IN THE LAST 
FRAME BEFORE THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL HE POTTED A GREAT LONG 
PINK HE WENT IN OFF VERY UNLIKELY 
TO LOSE THE FRAME VERY UNLUCKY 
LEE THEN THAT COMPLETELY 
UNFORESEEN MISCUE 
THAT IS ALL TO DO WITH THE PRESSURE 
THAT IS OUT THERE BRING HIS GRIP 
ON TO THE CUE TOO EARLY OR TO 
CHARGE OR TOO TIGHT 
HOW MUCH ANGLE HAS HE GOT HERE 
VERY LITTLE HE STRUCK THAT WELL 
THESE TWO REDS IN THE RIGHT ARE A 
SLIGHT PROBLEM 
HE'S HAVING A LOOK IN FOUR OF THOSE 
REDS BELOW THE PINK PARTIES IT 
MUST BE TIGHT 
HE HAS GOT THE ANGLE TO STUN OFF 
THE CUSHION THAT WAS A NICE DROPPING DROP IN HE COULDN'T HAVE HIT IT BETTER 
COULD HAVE HIT THAT ONE SLIGHTLY 
BETTER WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO 
HAVE BEEN THREE QUARTER BALL ON 
THIS PINK COULD HAVE HELD FOR THIS 
NEXT RED USING CUSHION 
HE LOOKS A BIT AWARE OF THE RED 
TOWARDS THE RIGHT MIDDLE 
IF CARTER CAN STAY IN CLOSE HERE 
YOU HAVE GOT TO SAY THIS IS TEN TO THREE 
COMING UP 
DEFINITELY ONE OF HIS STRENGTHS IS 
CUE BALL CONTROL HE KEEPS IT 
PRETTY CLOSE TO THE OBJECT BALL 
BURST OF THE TIME THAT IS THE BEST 
WAY TO OFFSET THE OR BLUE IS 
PRESSURE OUT THERE THE OBVIOUS 
PRESSURE OUT THERE 
HE IS PRETTY STRAIGHT NOT GOT A 
LOT TO PLAY WITH HERE HE COULD 
JUST SCREW BACK AND AVOID THAT RED ALL THESE FROM A MURPHY MISCUE 
JUST A RED AND A COLOUR NEEDED 
THEN 
THE CHANCE THAT HE COULD FOUL THE 
RED BY THE SIDE CUSHION WITH HIS 
BODY SO HE GETS MORE LENGTH ON HIS 
CUE LONGER BRIDGE REQUIRED 
THIS IS CARTER'S AID FOR BREAK OVER 
FORTY HTH BREAK OVER FORTY 
ALTHOUGH HE IS NOT UNDULY BOTHERED 
ABOUT IT IT COULD DEVELOP INTO SECOND CENTURY JUST FAILED TO DEVELOP THE STORY OF THE FRAME SIMPLY TOLD MURPHY MISCUES CARTER WENT 
IT IS LOOKING GOOD FOR ALI CARTER 
THE TRAINEE PILOT HE IS GOING WELL 
I DON'T NEED TO KICK A MAN WHEN 
HE'S DOWN ESPECIALLY NOT SHAUN 
MURPHY BUT DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HE 
SAID AT THE TRAIN STATION JUST A 
FEW SHORT MINUTES AGO 
AS YOU TAKE 
YOUR CUE BACK IT GOES INTO THE 
FRONT OF YOUR HAND THERE AS IT 
COMES THROUGH GOES INTO THE BACK OF 
YOUR HAND THERE HE SHOULD BE LEFT 
WITH A LITTLE GAP IF IT IS 
TOUCHING IT IS TOO TIGHT MY DAD 
ALWAYS USED TO SAY IF YOUR 
KNUCKLES WERE TO WHITE YOU'RE 
HOLDING IT TOO TIGHT 
THE JUST 
SHOWS YOU THE PRESSURE THAT HE IS 
UNDER HE DIDN'T TAKE HIS OWN 
ADVICE WE FANCY 
AND THAT IS ALL TO DO WITH THE 
PRESSURE THAT IS OUT THERE AND 
BRINGING HIS GRIP ON TO THE CUE 
TOO EARLY OR TOO TIGHT 
WE CAN LAUGH ABOUT THIS BUT THIS 
IS SERIOUS IT DOES SHOW YOU 
EXACTLY WHAT THE ATMOSPHERE AND 
THE SITUATION CAN DO 
HE POTTED A 
FANTASTIC PINK EARLIER ON AND HE 
WENT IN OFF WHICH WAS DESPERATELY 
UNLUCKY 
WHAT IS YOUR VIEW OF THE UNLUCKY WAY THINGS ARE PROGRESSING IT IT TAKES TWO TO TANGO IT IS DOWN TO 
THE OTHER GUY TO PUT YOU UNDER THE 
PRESSURE WHEN YOU START TO CRACK 
UP TO SOME DEGREE AND ALI CARTER 
HAS LOOKED MAGNIFICENT IN THIS 
MATCH SO FAR NOBODY EXPECTED HIM 
TO BE COMING THROUGH LIKE THIS 
SHAUN MURPHY WAS ELEVEN TO FOUR ON FOR THIS 
MATCH NOBODY GAVE CARTER MUCH OF A 
HOPE ALL THE SUDDEN HE IS LOOKING 
A MORE ACCOMPLISHED PLAYER LIKE 
RYAN DAY WAS AGAINST JOHN HIGGINS 
LET'S GET STRAIGHT BACK INTO THE 
MATCH 
A GOOD SHOT FROM CARTER HE AGED ON 
THE THIN SIDE TO MAKE SURE HE CAME 
BACK DOWN THIS SIDE OF THE TABLE 
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY GETTING THE 
SNOOKER BEHIND THE PINK 
FORTUNATELY FOR MURPHY QUARTER'S 
CUEING IS IMPEDED CARTER'S 
CUEING OTHERWISE THIS WOULD BE 
REASONABLE 
NO ATTEMPT TO POT IT UNLUCKY TO GO 
IN OFF BUT AT LEAST THE BLUE 
FINISHED WAY HE INTENDED TO LEAVE 
IT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING THAT 
MURPHY CAN NOW PLAY IT AT A MUCH 
CLOSER RANGE 
MURPHY WILL NOT NEED THE DIFFICULT 
BLACK NOW HE IS THE FIRST PLAYER 
TO GET BLUE AND PINK STILL 
ADVANTAGE TO MURPHY 
MURPHY LACKS NOTHING IN RESOLVE IN 
A SITUATION LIKE THIS HE BEAT 
MATTHEW STEVENS FROM FIVE DOWN WITH 
SIX TO PLAY IN LAST YEAR'S 
QUARTER FINALS HERE 
THIS FRAME WHICH YOU SAID HE WILL 
HAVE TO WIN IT IS TURNING INTO 
ANOTHER TIED FRAME CARTER HAS BEEN 
WINNING MOST OF THOSE TODAY 
ANOTHER GOOD SAFETY SHOT 
THIS IS A MUST WIN FRAME FOR MURPHY 
PERHAPS THAT WILL GIVE HIM THE 
IMPETUS TO GO ON AND TAKE THE LAST 
FRAME OF THIS SESSION 
THIS IS A CHANCE A DIFFICULT ONE 
YOU DON'T ALWAYS TAKE THESE ON 
JUST DEPENDS HOW THE PLAYER FEELS 
WHEN HE TAKES IT ON IF HE FANCIES 
IT AWKWARD BRIDGING THEREFORE 
QUARTER AWKWARD BRIDGING THERE 
ARE FOUR CARTER THAT MAKES IT MORE 
DIFFICULT HAS TO REASSESS THE 
SITUATION 
THAT IS THE THIRD HAND POSITION HE 
HAS TRIED AND WHAT A GOOD SHOT 
PINK FOR TWELVE TO THREE 
THAT WAS SIMILAR TO 
THE YELLOW WE SHOWED YOU HE HAS 
GOT TOO MUCH BACKSPIN ON THIS IN IT GOES 
CARTER IS WITHIN A FRAME OF A PLACE 
IN THE QUARTER FINALS HE COULD WIN 
IT IN THIS SESSION 
BUT HE DID NOT 
BECAUSE SHAUN MURPHY WANT THE NEXT 
TWO TOO MUCH TO DO FOR SHAUN 
MURPHY 
EVEN IAN SIBBIT ERA MURPHY PERFORMANCES FROM LAST YEAR I'M 
NOT SURE IT WILL BE THAT EASY OF L. 
THINK THERE IS NO WAY BACK ALI ALI CARTER HIS INABILITY TO FINISH OFF 
MATCHES HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT MANY 
TIMES HE CAN GET ACROSS THE LINE 
HERE SURELY 
ABSOLUTELY LAST YEAR 
HE WAS INVOLVED IN A THRILLER WITH 
MARK SELBY IN THE QUARTER FINAL 
LOST THIRTEEN TO TWELVE CARTER IS USED TO 
PLAYING WELL IN THE CRUCIBLE I I WILL NEVER FORGET IT IT WAS 
MIDNIGHT I WAS STILL ON IT WAS 
FANTASTIC 
HE'S IN TERRIFIC FORM FANTASTIC HE'S VERY RELAXED AROUND THE HOTEL 
HE'S VERY CONFIDENT WITH HIS GAME 
AT THE MOMENT HE IS SCORING IN 
AMONGST THE BALLS 
A QUICK ONE 
ABOUT MARK WILLIAMS AGAINST RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN FUNNILY ENOUGH THOUGH 
HARDLY PLAY ONE ANOTHER 
I HAVE 
TRIED TO THINK BACK IT IS SORT OF 
AN X. FACTOR MATCH TO DECIDE HOW IT 
IS GOING TO GO MARK COLLINS LOOKS 
LIKE HE'S BACK TO SOME KIND OF FORM 
HE'S THE TYPE OF PLAYER HE'S VERY 
CLEVER SAFETY WISE HE PLAYS SOME 
GOOD SHOTS HE'S THE TYPE OF PLAYER 
WHO COULD UNNERVE RONNIE BUT YOU 
ALWAYS THINK RONNIE IS GOING TO BE 
ABLE TO FIRE A ROCKET OR TWO HE HE BLASTS OFF AT SEVEN P. M. 
WE ARE BACK ON AIR SHORTLY TWO A 
FORMER CHAMPIONS BOTH OF THEM HAVE 
WON THIS TITLE TWICE SOMETHING 
HAVE TO GIVE BUT FIRST A REMINDER 
OF SNOOKER PUTS BACK STEVE SPEED 
DEMON 
YOUR TOWN 
YOUR STREET 
YOUR HOME 
IT'S ALL IN OUR DATABASE 
NEW TECHNOLOGY MEANS IT'S EASY TO PAY YOUR T. V. LICENCE 
AND IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE IF YOU DON'T
