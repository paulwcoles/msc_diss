TUPID 
I'M JOSHUA AND I LIKE FIXING THINGS 
I'VE FIXED COMPUTERS ALARM CLOCKS AND MY BACK GATE 
WHEN WE FIRST MOVED INTO THIS HOUSE 
MY DAD NEEDED A LOT OF HELP FIXING THINGS 
HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO USE ALL THE TOOLS 
I GOT GOOD AT IT 
THIS IS SPANNER USED FOR TIGHTENING NUTS AND BOLTS 
PLIERS ARE USED FOR TIGHTENING THINGS GRIPPING THINGS 
AND CUTTING WIRES 
THIS IS A PIN HAMMER 
I HELP MY DAD FIX THE CAR BY PASSING HIM TOOLS AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT CARS BUT MY DAD'S TEACHING ME ABOUT HOW 
TO FIX THINGS INSIDE THE CAR 
MY DAD TRICKED ME WHEN I WAS FIXING THE GATE 
MY DAD WAS WATCHING ME IN CASE I HURT MYSELF 
HE PUT SOME KETCHUP ON HIS HAND AND WENT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GATE 
I PUT THE SCREW IN WITH THE DRILL AND MY DAD PRETENDED I HURT HIM 
I THOUGHT IT WENT THROUGH AND CUT MY DAD'S HAND 
IT DIDN'T CUT HIS HAND BUT I THOUGHT IT DID 
THE KETCHUP LOOKED LIKE BLOOD IT WAS HORRIBLE 
I LIKE FIXING COMPUTERS 
I HATE SCHOOL 
I FIXED MY NAN'S COMPUTER COS SHE NEEDED HER FILES IN ONE FOLDER 
I THINK I'M THE BEST AT COMPUTERS IN MY FAMILY 
I'VE GOT TWO SISTERS WHO ARE VERY ANNOYING 
AND BREAK NEARLY EVERYTHING 
MOST OF THE THINGS IN THE HOUSE 
THEY BROKE THE GATE SWINGING ON IT 
IF I DO FIX SOMETHING FOR THEM 
THEY NEVER SAY THANK YOU WHICH IS REALLY ANNOYING 
I DON'T FEEL I CAN FIX THINGS AGAIN FOR THEM 
MY NAME IS JOSHUA AND I LIKE FIXING THINGS
