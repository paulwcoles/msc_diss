GOOD EVENING THE RESCUE EFFORT IN 
CHINA HAS REACHED ITS MOST CRITICAL 
PHASE ACCORDING TO THE COUNTRY'S 
PRESIDENT AND FOR THE FIRST TIME 
CHINA HAS ALLOWED IN FOREIGN TEAMS 
TO HELP IN A NATIONAL DISASTER THE 
DEATH TOLL FROM THE EARTHQUAKE IS 
BELIEVED TO NUMBER SOME FIFTY THOUSAND NOW 
WITH SOME FIVE MILLION REMAINING 
HOMELESS A LUCKY FEW ARE STILL 
BEING PULLED FROM THE RUBBLE 
THE FIRST THING YOU NOTICE IS THE 
SILENCE SILENCE BEICHUAN HAS GONE QUIET 
WHEN A WHOLE TOWN HAS BEEN 
DESTROYED WHERE DO YOU EVEN START 
TO LOOK 
THIS MAN STANDS ON THE REMAINS OF 
HIS HOUSE AND CALLS OUT FOR HIS 
WIFE WU M. E. I. IT SEEMS INCREDIBLE 
ANYBODY MIGHT STILL BE ALIVE UNDER 
ALL THIS BUT ON THE THIRD FLOOR 
OF THE LOCAL TRANSPORT OFFICE 
RESCUERS HAVE FOUND A SURVIVOR YU 
KHAN IS TRAPPED UNDER THE CONCRETE 
GIVE ME TWO FOUR BOTTLES OF 
WATER 
WE NEED SOMETHING TO LIFT WATER THE CONCRETE TO GET HIS LEGS OUT 
RIGHT NOW ALL YU CHAN CAN DO IS 
WAIT HE HASN'T BEEN TOLD HIS 
MOTHER DIED IN THE EARTHQUAKE 
IN THE EARLY EVENING WE COME 
ACROSS MORE RESCUERS THEY'RE 
DIGGING THROUGH THE OFFICES OF A 
POWER COMPANY RIGHT HERE RESCUERS 
HAVE FOUND TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL 
ALIVE BUT THEY'RE TRAPPED INSIDE 
THE RUBBLE THEY'VE SPOKEN TO 
WOMAN WHOSE TRAPPED RIGHT UNDER 
THERE WITH A CHILD AND WE'VE JUST 
HEARD THEM SAY TO THE WOMAN DON'T 
WORRY WE WILL GET YOU OUT THEY 
REMOVE DEBRIS BIT BY BIT AN HOUR 
GOES BY 
THEN THE WOMAN IS BROUGHT OUT 
SHE PUTS HER ARM OVER HER EYES TO 
SHIELD HERSELF FROM THE LIGHT 
RESCUERS CARRY HER THROUGH THE 
WRECKAGE WRECKAGE THE PARAMEDIC GIVES HER SOME 
GLUCOSE GLUCOSE AND SHE'S CARRIED TO HOSPITAL 
AM I SERIOUSLY INJURED SHE ASKS 
THERE MAY BE MORE PEOPLE LIKE HER 
STILL UNDER THE WRECKAGE BUT 
EVERYONE ELSE WHO SURVIVED THE 
QUAKE HAS LEFT THEIR TONE NO 
LONGER EXISTS 
THESE CHILDREN FROM BEICHUAN MIDDLE 
SCHOOL HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO A NEARBY 
CITY THEY'RE WAITING FOR THEIR 
PARENTS TO PICK THEM UP 
BUT NO ONE KNOWS WHETHER OR NOT 
THEIR FAMILIES ARE STILL ALIVE 
THE CHINESE PRESIDENT HU JINTAO 
FLEW INTO THE EARTHQUAKE ZONE TO 
SEE THE DAMAGE HIMSELF THERE'S 
BEEN PRAISE BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE 
CHINA ON THE THERE'S ALSO GROWING 
ANGER ABOUT HOW EASILY SOME PUBLIC 
BUILDINGS SUCH AS SCHOOLS SUCCUMBED 
TO THE QUAKE 
EVEN THOUGH THE ODDS ARE AGAINST 
THEM THE RESCUERS DON'T RELENT IN 
THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING 
THEIR FAITH PAYS OFF YOUNG BOY 
TRAPPED IN THE DARKNESS FOR DAYS 
RE EMERGES INTO THE TORCHLIGHT 
BUT THESE GLIMMERS OF HE HOPE ARE 
BECOMING INCREASINGLY RARE 
AS DAY LIGHT BREAKS A HARSHER 
REALITY IT'S THE SAME TOWN BUT A 
DIFFERENT SCHOOL THE SPORTS TRACK 
BECOMES MORGUE THE PARENTS COME 
WITH AN AWFUL TASK THEY IDENTIFY 
THEIR CHILDREN AND TAKE THEM HOME 
IN THIS ONE SCHOOL ALONE SEVEN HUNDRED 
STUDENTS ARE FEARED DEAD IN 
SICHUAN PROVINCE NEARLY SEVEN THOUSAND 
SCHOOLS HAVE FALLEN PARENTS ACROSS 
CHINA WANT TO KNOW WHY 
AND IT'S NOT JUST SCHOOLS THIS IS 
ALL THAT'S LEFT OF BEICHUAN A 
WHOLE TOWN WIPED FROM THE MAP 
IT WAS HERE THAT CHINA'S PRESIDENT 
ARRIVED KEEP SEARCHING HE TOLD 
THEM THEM YOU ARE 
CONFIDENCE AND STRENGTH TO THE 
PEOPLE IN DISASTER AREAS YOU'RE 
LETTING THEM SEE HOPE 
THE COMMUNIST PARTY HE LEADS HAS 
RARELY BEEN MORE POPULAR THE 
COUNTRY IS UNIFIED IN THE FACE OF 
THIS DISASTER CHINA BEATS WITH ONE 
HEART IS THE SLOGAN OF THE MOMENT 
RIGHT NOW THE BENEFITS RIGHT NOW 
IT BENEFITS THE LEADERSHIP SO 
THERE'S GREATER PRESS FREEDOM THIS 
AFTER ALL IS A NATURAL DISASTER 
NOT A POLITICAL ONE BUT THIS NEW 
OPENNESS IS IS BOUND TO HAVE ITS 
LIMITS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE 
DIFFICULT QUESTIONS COME ABOUT WHY 
SO MANY BUILDINGS CRUMBLED 
THE OWNERS OF THESE APARTMENTS ARE 
ANGRY THEY WERE NEWLY BUILT AND 
COST TWENTY THOUSAND WHICH IS A LOT OF 
MONEY HERE THEY SAY THEY WERE 
SHODILLY BUILT AND THEY'RE 
WONDERING WHY THEIR APARTMENTS FELL 
SO QUICKLY WHILE THEIR NEIGHBOURS' 
ARE STILL STANDING 
GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION 
IS TO BLAIXT IT'S A DODGY PROJECT 
THE DEVELOPERS BRIBED THE 
GOVERNMENT THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT 
MONEY THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE 
PEOPLE PEOPLE THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER 
NEIGHBOURS TO BEAR THEY QUICKLY 
SHUT HER UP BUT THE QUESTIONS 
WON'T GO AWAY AS CHINA'S HOUSING 
MINISTER DISCOVERED 
I WAS HEAVY HEARTED 
WHEN I SAW THOSE STUDENTS BEING 
PULLED OUT IF WE FIND OUT THE 
COLLAPSED BUILDINGS HAVE QUALITY 
PROBLEMS THEN WE WILL DEAL WITH 
THEM AGGRESSIVELY 
BUT THOSE ARE QUESTIONS FOR LATER 
FOR NOW CHINA AND ITS SOLDIERS ARE 
FOCUSED ON A FAR MORE IMMEDIATE 
LOSS LOSS AND FOR ALL THE VERY LATEST 
INFORMATION ON THE EARTHQUAKE YOU 
CAN GO TO OUR WEBSITE 
THE B. B. C. HAS OBTAINED NEW IMAGES OF 
THE VIOLENCE IN MANCHESTER AS 
RANGERS FANS WENT ON THE RAMPAGE

HURT AS THE SUPPORTERS SET ON HIM 
HERE'S MARK SIMPSON 
ON THE RAMPAGE CHASING THE POLICE 
AND HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
KICKING AND THE SCREAMING IS A 
DEFENCELESS OFFICER 
THESE NEW PICTURES SHOW THE 
FEROCITY OF THE VIOLENCE INVOLVING 
RANGERS SUPPORTERS IN MANCHESTER ON 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
AND A FEW STREETS AWAY ANOTHER MOB 
AND ANOTHER POLICEMAN IS UNDER 
ATTACK 
THAT IS A PUNCTURE WOUND ATTACK OBVIOUSLY THE BANDAGE IS TO KEEP 
THE SWELLING DOWN 
HIS BODY IS 
COVERED IN BRUISING HIS HEAD IS 
STILL REELING AND HIS HANDS ARE 
STILL SHAKING 
AT THE TIME I 
THOUGHT I'D BEEN PUSHED OVER I'D 
JUST BEEN HIT ON THE LEFT ELBOW BY 
A BOTTLE AND I WAS STARTING TO BE 
DRAWN UP NEW TONNE STREET AND I 
ENDED UP ON THE FLOOR THE NEXT 
THING I KNEW I WAS GETTING KICKED 
ON THE BODY AND LEGS L. KNEW I WAS 
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE BECAUSE THE 
OTHER OFFICERS WERE BEING DRAWN 
INTO THE STREET AND I THOUGHT I WAS 
GOING TO START GETTING HURT AT THAT 
POINT I TRIED TO GET TO THE RADIO 
TO ACTIVATE MY MERGE BUTTON AND 
COULDN'T GET TO IT AT THAT POINT ONE 
THOUGHT I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE 
BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE WILL HURT ME 
AT THAT POINT I MANAGED TO GET GET 
UP AND RUN 
YOU CAN SEE MY 
COLLEAGUES AT THE TOP OF THE STREET 
THAT'S ME IN THE MIDDLE HERE 
THAT'S WHY THEY THREW THE BOTTLE AT 
ME I WAS TRIPPED UP BY THAT LAD 
THERE 
LOOKING AT THAT AGAIN HOW THERE DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL FUNNILY FUNNILY ENOUGH WATCHING IT FROM THERE NOW 
YOU IT'S IT BRINGS IT ALL BACK 
TO YOU AT THE TIME IT IS 
FRIGHTENING LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY 
IT'S LIKE A FLASHBACK 
AND IT SEEMS WORSE NOW NOW THAT I 
SEE THEM ATACT LIKE THAT NOT JUST 
ME OBVIOUSLY BUT MY COLLEAGUES AS

TO COME IN L. WAS JUST TRYING TO 
DEFEND MYSELF AS BEST AS I COULD 
THERE THERE AND AFTER THAT IT WAS JUST HELP 
GET ME OUT OF HERE 
IN TOTAL FIFTEEN 
POLICE OFFICERS WERE INJURED ON 
THESE STREETS ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
SINCE THEN TWO THINGS HAVE BECOME 
CLEAR THE EXTENT OF THE BRUTALITY 
THEY FACE AND JUST HOW CLOSE SOME 
POLICE OFFICERS CAME TO BEING 
KILLED KILLED IT WAS THE NIGHT THE BEAUTIFUL GAME 
TURNED UGLY WHEN THE EYES OF 
EUROPE WERE ON BRITAIN THE HOPE IS 
THAT THIS WAS SIMPLY A ONE OFF 
A WOMAN WHO SMUGGLED A BABY IN FROM 
NIGERIA IN ORDER TO GET A COUNCIL 
FLAT HAS BEEN JAILED FOR JUST OVER 
TWO YEARS PEACE SANDBERG PAID ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
FOR THE BABY BOY BEFORE RETURNING 
TO BRITAIN A COURT HEARD SHE WENT 
STRAIGHT FROM THE AIRPORT TO THE 
HOUSING DEPARTMENT TO MAKE HER 
CLAIM FOR A FLAT 
A HIGH COURT HAS RULED THAT FOURTEEN M. P.'S 
INCLUDING GORDON BROWN AND DAVID 
CAMERON SHOULD BE FORCED TO REVEAL 
THE DETAILS OF EXPENSES THEY 
CLAIMED FOR SECOND HOMES THE HOUSE 
OF COMMONS HAD HOPED TO KEEP THE 
DETAILS SECRET LET'S SPEAK TO OUR 
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT HOW 
SIGNIFICANT IS THIS DECISION 
POTENTIALLY VERY SIGNIFICANT 
BECAUSE IT COULD OPEN UP THE 
EXPENSES THAT M. P.'S CLAIM TO EVEN 
GREATER SKRUT KNEE WE HAVE HAD 
GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR 
SPENDING BEFORE BUT NOT THE SORT OF 
DETAILED BREAKDOWN THAT'S BEEN 
REQUESTED NOW WITH INVOICES AND 
RECEIPTS ON ALL EXPENSES CLAIMED ON 
THEIR SECOND HOMES THE COMMONS 
AUTHORITIES HAVE SPENT THREE YEARS 
FIGHTING THIS THEY COULD STILL 
APPEAL BUT IF THEY DON'T THE 
INFORMATION WILL BE REVEALED NEXT 
FRIDAY NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING 
ABOUT THIS IS THE COMMONS 
AUTHORITIES ARGUE THAT THEY DON'T 
WANT M. P.S' ADDRESSES TO BE RELEASED 
BECAUSE THAT MIGHT BE SECURITY 
RISK BUT THE JUDGES THEY DIDN'T 
THINK MUCH OF THIS BECAUSE THEY 
SAID THEY'D HEARD EVIDENCE THAT ONE 
M. P. NOT NECESSARILY ONE OF THESE 
FOURTEEN HAD BEEN CLAIMING EXPENSES ON 
A PROPERTY THAT DIDN'T EXIST THEY 
SAID THERE COULD BE OTHER M. P.'S WHO 
SUBLETTING PROPERTIES THAT 
WERE SUBLETTING PROPERTIES THAT THEY PAID FOR ON 
BECAUSE OF THIS SCOPE FOR 
THEY SAY THE ADDRESSES SHOULD BE 
PUBLISHED PUBLISHED ZIMBABWE'S ROBERT MUGABE ADMITTED 
TODAY THAT THE RESULT OF MARCH'S 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION HAD BEEN 
DISASTROUS A DATE FOR A SECOND 
ELECTION HAS BEEN SET FOR JUNE THE 
OPPOSITION LEADER MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI HAS TOLD OUR 
CORRESPONDENT HE WILL CONTEST THE 
RUN OFF BUT HAS ALSO NEGOTIATED THE 
POSSIBILITY OF A POWER SHARING 
DEALING DEAL YOU MAY FIND SOFT OF 
THE IMAGES IN THIS REPORT 
DISTURBING A WARM WELCOME FOR A 
LEADER FACING THE FIGHTING OF HIS 
LIFE MORGAN TSVANGIRAI MAKING A 
BRIEF APPEARANCE IN BELFAST ON THE 
EVE OF RETURNING TO HIS HOMELAND 
THE HOPES OF MANY ARE RESTING ON 
HIS SHOULDERS AND HIS MESSAGE HERE 
THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE'S DOWNFALL IS 
INEVITABLE IN AN EARLIER B. B. C. 
INTERVIEW HE SAID THE RULING PARTY 
IS MAKING OVERTURES ABOUT A 
NATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT 
WE'VE SAID LOOK YOU HAVE TO 
DEMONSTRATE TO US YOU HAVE CHEATED 
BEFORE YOU HAVE TO GIVE US THE 
SINCERITY THAT YOU'RE SERIOUS YOU YOU AS THE M. D. C. HAVE NO PRECONDITION 
ABOUT PRESIDENT MUGABE YOU'RE 
PREPARED TO ACCEPT HE MIGHT BE PART 
OF A UNITY GOVERNMENT 
WE'RE NOT 
PUTTING ANY PRECONDITIONS IF WE'RE 
SAYING TO THEM NO PRECONDITIONS 
EQUALLY SO THEY'RE NOT PUTTING ANY 
PRECONDITIONS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
THE COUNTRY'S FUTURE 
BACK IN 
ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT MUGABE'S MIND 
MIND WAS ON HIS OWN FUTURE NO ONE NO ONE INDIVIDUAL LIVES FOREVER NO ONE 
INDIVIDUAL GOVERNS FOREVER I HAVE 
TO BE SUCCEEDED 
BUT NOT HE VOWED BY THE M. D. C. 
ITS SUPPORTERS AREN'T SAFE EVEN ON 
SACRED GROUND 
THIS GROUP TAKEN FROM A CHURCH BY 
POLICE AND WE'VE BEEN TOLD 
DUMPED IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE 
IT'S IN THE REMOTE RURAL AREAS THAT 
THE RULING PARTY DOING ITS WORST 
M. D. C. VOTERS ARE BEING BURNT OUT OR 
STARVED OUT THEIR MEAGRE FOOD 
SUPPLIES HAVE BEEN TORCHED 
PAYBACK FOR OPPOSING ROBERT MUGABE 
AND IT CAN GET LOT WORSE 
NELSON A PARTY ACTIVIST WAS 
ATTACKED WITH SCREWDRIVER 
NOT LONG AFTER THESE PICTURES WERE 
TAKEN HE SLIPPED AWAY 
ONE OF MORE THAN THIRTY KILLED SO FAR 
ACCORDING TO THE M. D. C. SOME BURIED 
UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS SUCH IS 
THE FEAR 
THIS IS WHAT AWAITS MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI HE'S DUE BACK IN 
ZIMBABWE TOMORROW AFTER LONG 
ABSENCE TOO LONG SOME OF HIS 
SUPPORTERS SAY HE PLANS TO START 
CAMPAIGNING IMMEDIATELY TO RALLY 
THE PARTY FAITHFUL THE BIG UNKNOWN 
IS HOW MANY WILL HAVE BEEN SCARED 
AWAY AWAY COMING UP ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME 
ON THE EVE OF THE F. A. CUP HOW HARRY 
REDKNAPP'S PUT PORTSMOUTH FIRMLY 
BACK ON THE PATH TO GLORY 
BRITISH AIRWAYS MADE PROFITS OF 
NEARLY NINE HUNDRED MILLION LAST YEAR 
DESPITE SOARING OIL PRICES AND 
DISASTROUS OPENING OF HEATHROW 
TERMINAL FIVE BUT THE COMPANY'S CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE WILLIE WALSH HAS TURNED 
DOWN HIS BONUS AND WARNED THAT THE 
YEAR AHEAD WILL BE VERY CHALLENGING 
WHAT A YEAR FOR BRITISH AIRWAYS 
FROM A DRAMATIC AIR CRASH TO A 
CONVICTION FOR PRICE FIXING TO OF 
COURSE THE GLITTERING PROMISE AND 
DISASTROUS DEBUT OF TERMINAL FIVE 
BRITISH AIRWAYS'S PROFIT LAST YEAR 
WAS EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE MILLION ACHIEVED IN 
DIFFICULT TIMES FOR AIRLINES BUT 
BRITISH AIRWAYS'S DOING WELL 
BECAUSE IT'S CARRYING MORE PREMIUM 
PASSENGERS IN THE EXPENSIVE SEATS 
IT'S CUT ITS STAFF COSTS BUT THE 
FUEL BILL WAS NOT GOOD TWO POINT ONE 
BILLION LAST YEAR IN THE THREE 
YEARS SINCE WILLIE WALSH FORMER 
PILOT TOOK OVER BRITISH AIRWAYS 
PROFITS HAVE DOUBLED BUT TERMINAL 
FIVE SHOWED HOW HARD IT IS FOR BRITISH 
AIRWAYS TO PROVIDE WHAT'S CALLED 
THE BASICS CUSTOMER SERVICE YET 
DOING ROUND OF INTERVIEWS TODAY 
THE BRITISH AIRWAYS BOSS WAS TRYING 
NOT TO GET OBSESSED BY THAT FIASCO 
WE LOOK BACK ON THE YEAR AND SAY 
WHAT LESSONS CAN WE LEARN WHAT CAN 
WE DO BETTER WHAT ARE WE WE 
DETERMINED TO ADDRESS AND HOW CAN 
WE DELIVER BETTER SERVICE FOR OUR 
CUSTODYENERS ZBLND AT SERVICE IS 
GETTING BETTER AT TERMINAL FIVE WHERE 
GRATEFUL FOR ONE DECISION HE HAD 
MADE NOT TO TAKE A BONUS BRITISH BRITISH AIRWAYS AND WILLIE WALSH FACE TWO 
GREAT UNPREDICTABLES FIRSTLY 
MOVING ALL THE REMAINING FLIGHTS 
INTO THIS PLACE SECONDLY THE 
SOARING COST OF FUEL WHICH FOR 
ALL AIRLINES IS A NIGHTMARE EVERY 
TIME THE PRICE OF OIL GOES UP A 
DOLLAR SIXTEEN MILLION ARE WIPED FROM 
BRITISH AIRWAYS'S PROFITS THE 
AIRLINE SURVIVED BY SLIMMING DOWN 
THEY'VE SHRUNK INTO PROFITABILITY 
UNLIKE MANY AIRLINES IN THE WORLD 
THAT WILL PRESS ON ON REGARDLESS 
BUILDING AND BUILDING MARKET SHARE 
THEY'VE LOOKED AT THE BITS THAT 
MAKE MONEY AND CONCENTRATED ON THAT 
SO WHAT OF THE BOSS IF THE TIME 
MOVE INTO T. FIVE GOES BADLY WILL HE 
RESIGN NO 
YOU CAN'T SAY HE'S NOT RESIGN NO CONFIDENT CONFIDENT THE OFFICIAL DEATH TOLL OF THE 
CYCLONE DISASTER IN BURMA HAS RISEN 
TO SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND AS THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY 
REGIME CONTINUES TO BLOCK AID FROM 
REACHING THE SURVIVORS U. S. NAVY 
TASK FORCE LOADED WITH SUPPLIES HAS 
ARRIVED OFFSHORE BUT THE TEAMS ARE 
STILL NOT BEING ALLOWED TO LAND 
THE LARGEST VESSEL IS THE U. S. S. ESSEX 
EQUIPPED WITH HELICOPTERS AND 
LANDING CRAFT OUR CORRESPONDENT IS 
ON BOARD AND SENT THIS REPORT 
THE WATERS CLOSE TO THE IRRAWADDY 
DELTA AND AN AMERICAN NAVAL TASK 
FORCE DEPLOYED TO OFFER AID BUT 
PREVENTED FROM DOING SO BY THE 
BURMESE MILITARY JUNTA 
THEY'RE SO CLOSE THEY CAN ALMOST 
SEE THE SHORE JUST SIXTY NAUTICAL 
MILES FROM WHERE SO MANY PEOPLE ARE 
SUFFERING THEY'VE BEEN HERE ON 
TUESDAY WEIGHED DOWN WITH AID BUT 
WITHOUT THE PERMISSION TO DELIVER 
IT WE'RE GETTING INFERPBS ON THE 
MICROPHONE WE WANTED TO SHOW YOU 
THIS THE IDLE FLIGHT DECK THESE 
PLANES COULD BE GIVING AID TO BURMA 
IF THE AUTHORITIES GAVE THE GO 
AHEAD THEY'VE BEEN SAT IDLE SINCE 
TUESDAY 
ONCE WE GET THE PERMISSION TUESDAY TO GO AND DIRECTED TO DO SO THE THE COMMANDER KNOWS THE COURSE IT'S 
THE TIMETABLE THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
WE JUST WANT TO BE PREPARED WHEN 
CALLED UPON TO ACT AND TO ASSIST 
AND WHEN CALLED UPON WE'LL GET 
THERE AS QUICKLY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN 
FRESH FRESH DRINKING WATER THE 
KEY TO SURVIVAL IN ANY HUMANITARIAN 
DISASTER THE U. S. S. ESSEX CAN PRODUCE 
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND GALLONS A DAY ANOTHER 
LIFE SAVING RESOURCE THAT'S SIMPLY 
SITTING AWAITING AIRLIFT I'M I'M ANXIOUS TO BE ABLE TO HELP THOSE 
PEOPLE SO DESPERATELY AFFECTED BY 
THE CYCLONE ABSOLUTELY WE JUST 
HAVE SO MUCH TO GIVE THEM THE THE BURMESE MILITARY JUNTA HAS ALLOWED 
AMERICAN TRANSPORT PLANES IN LAND 
IN RANGOON OVER A DOZEN OF THEM 
SO WHY NOT AID FROM THIS NAVAL 
TASK FORCE POSITIONED OFF ITS 
SHORES 
THE SOUTH AFRICAN ATHLETE OSCAR 
PISTORIUS WHO IS A DOUBLE AMPUTEE 
WILL BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE AGAINST 
ABLE BODIED RUNNERS IF HE QUALIFIES 
FOR THE OLYMPIC GAMES THE COURT OF 
ARBITRATION FOR SPORT HAS 
OVERTURNED AN EARLIER RULING THAT 
HIS CARBON FIBRE BLADES GAVE HIM AN 
UNFAIR ADVANTAGE 
OSCAR PISTORIUS 
IS FLYING AWAY FROM ALL OF THEM 
THIS WAS OSCAR PISTORIUS AT THE 
LAST PARALYMPIC GAMES IN ATHENS A 
GOLD MEDALLIST AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN HE 
CHERISHED THE DREAM OF COMPETING 
AGAINST ABLE BODIED ATHLETES BUT 
WAS BANNED FROM DOING SO TODAY 
CAME THE BREAKTHROUGH HE CRAVED 
NOW CLEARED TO RACE AGAINST ANYBODY 
HE LIKES 
I THINK THIS THEY WILL GO 
DOWN IN HISTORY FOR THE QUALITY OF 
DISABLED PEOPLE IT IS SUCH A 
SIGNIFICANT DATE IN SPORTS AS I 
SAY I AM SO HAPPY THE LAST TWO 
DAYS HAVE BEEN STRESSFUL BUT THE 
OUTCOME HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BEST 
DAYS OF MY LIFE 
OSCAR PISTORIUS 
HAD HIS LEGS AMPUTATED BELOW THE 
KNEE AT THE AGE OF ELEVEN MONTHS HE IS 
TWENTY ONE BUT HAS ONLY BEEN RUNNING 
COMPETITIVELY FOR FOUR YEARS HE 
RELIES ON PROSTHETIC CARBON FIBRE 
LIMBS TO DROP HIM RUN IT IS THESE 
THAT HAVE CAUSED CONTROVERSY TO 
HELP HIM RUN A THE I. A. A. F. BANNED HIM 
FROM COMPETING AGAINST ABLE BODIED 
ATHLETES SAYING THE BLADES GAVE 
HIM AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE THAT 
DECISION HAS NOW BEEN REVERSED HE 
HAS ALREADY COMPETED IN TRIAL 
EVENTS AGAINST ABLE BODIED RUNNERS 
THIS WAS A RACE IN SHEFFIELD LAST 
YEAR NOW HIS POSITION IS NO 
LONGER IN DISPUTE AND HIS AMBITION 
IS CLEAR 
I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
CHASE MY DREAM OF PARTICIPATING IN 
THE OLYMPICS IF NOT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN 
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
TODAY'S RULING IS SPECIFIC TO TWO THOUSAND TWELVE HIM SO MAY NOT SET A PRECEDENT FOR 
EVERY ASPIRING PARALYMPIAN BUT FOR 
THIS EXTRAORDINARY YOUNG SOUTH 
AFRICAN IT OFFERS AN INVITATION TO 
LIVE UP TO GREAT PROMISE AND GREAT 
AMBITION AMBITION DWAIN CHAMBERS IS TO CHALLENGE THE 
BAN IMPOSED ON HIM COMPETING IN THE 
OLYMPICS HE TESTED POSITIVE FOR A 
BANNED SUBSTANCE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE AND SERVED 
A TWO YEAR SUSPENSION HE TOOK 
SILVER IN THE SIXTY METRES AT THE 
WORLD INDOOR CHAMPIONSHIPS THIS 
YEAR AND WILL CAMPAIGN IN THE 
COURTS TO HAVE THE BRITISH OLYMPIC 
ASSOCIATION'S RULE LIFTED 
TOMORROW PORTSMOUTH FACE CARDIFF AT 
WEMBLEY IN THE F. A. CUP FINAL THE 
SOUTH COAST TEAM LAST WON THE CUP 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE BUT THEIR FORTUNES HAVE 
CHANGED CONSIDERABLY IN RECENT 
TIMES THE MAN WHO HAS LED THE 
TRANSFORMATION IS THEIR SIXTY ONE YEAR OLD 
MANAGER HARRY REDKNAPP KEVIN 
GEAREY TAKES A LOOK AT THE MAN 
BEHIND THE TEAM AND HIS REPORT 
CONTAINS FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY 
JUST WILD ABOUT HARRY MAYBE NOT 
WILD BUT THERE IS SOMETHING 
ENDEARING ABOUT THE PORTSMOUTH 
MANAGER BE IT THAT MISLEADING 
CHEEKY CHAPPIE APPEARANCE OR THAT 
IN A MULTINATIONAL DIS HE MEETS 
THE CRITERIA FOR A TYPICAL ENGLISH 
FOOTBALL BOSS BUT THERE IS MUCH 
MORE TO HARRY REDKNAPP A SHREWD 
JUDGE OF TALENT THE ABILITY TO GET 
MOST OUT OF IT AND HOW TO STRIKE A 
DEAL 
HE IS THE CRAFTSMAN WHO HAS DEAL BEEN PUSHING IT FORWARD WE HAVE 
THE BEST MANAGER FOR A CLUB LIKE 
OURS AND IN GENERAL L. THINK WE 
HAVE THE BEST MANAGER IN ENGLAND 
IT HAS BEEN QUIETER YEAR FOR HARRY 
TOUTED BY SOME FOR THE ENGLAND JOB 
BUT OVERLOOKED ARRESTED ALTHOUGH 
NOT CHARGED IN A POLICE BUNG 
INQUIRY AND TURNING DOWN THE 
CHANCE TO MANAGE NEWCASTLE UNITED 
ALL THE TIME HIS UNDERRATED 
PORTSMOUTH TEAM HAVE ACHIEVED THEY 
HELD THE LEAD POSITION CAPPED BY 
THEIR FIRST CUP FINAL APPEARANCE 
SINCE NINETEEN THIRTY NINE BACK THEN THE WINDS OF 
WAR WERE BLOWING ACROSS EUROPE 
PORTSMOUTH ONE THAT DAY BUT THEIR 
DELIGHT WAS SOON OVERWHELMED BY 
GLOBAL CATASTROPHE HARRY 
APPRECIATES THE WEIGHT OF F. A. CUP 
HISTORY 
LEADING 
THE TEAM OUT IN HISTORY THE CUP FINAL IS FANTASTIC FOR THE 
POMPEY FANS TO BE GOING THERE FOR 
THE SEMIS AND TO GO BACK FOR A 
FINAL IS A GREAT DAY FOR A CLUB 
THE TOWN FOR EVERYBODY FANTASTIC 
EVEN NOW RUMOURS CIRCULATE THAT HE 
MIGHT CALL IT A DAY AFTER THE FINAL 
NOBODY IN PORTSMOUTH NOR MANY 
OTHERS BEYOND WANT TO BELIEVE THAT 
THE END OF HARRY'S GAME WILL BE 
MARKED AT WEMBLEY BY ONE OF THE 
OLDEST FOOTBALL ANTHEMS THE POMPEY
