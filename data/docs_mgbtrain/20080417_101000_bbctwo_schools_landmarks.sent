CARIBBEAN ISLAND RADIO 
LEAVING THE PARTY BEHIND IN TRINIDAD WE'RE HOOKING UP WITH DOMINICA 
IT'S FIVE HUNDRED FORTY KILOMETRES AWAY 
TOUCHING DOWN ON THE NORTHEAST COAST OF DOMINICA 
THE ATLANTIC OCEAN THRASHES AGAINST THE SHORELINE 
THIS AREA IS THE CARIB TERRITORY 
THE CARIBS ORIGINALLY LIVED IN THESE ISLANDS 
BECAUSE OF CARIBS THE ISLANDS ARE CALLED CARIBBEAN 
THEY LIVE THROUGHOUT DOMINICA BUT THE CARIB TERRITORY IS THEIRS ALONE 
THEY ARE PART OF MODERN SOCIETY BUT THEY MAINTAIN THEIR OWN TRADITIONS 
I'M SUSAN SANFORD I'M ELEVEN YEARS OLD 
I'M A CARIB AND ALSO A DOMINICAN 
MY ANCESTORS CAME TO THE CARIBBEAN THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO 
THEY TRAVELLED GREAT DISTANCES BY SEA 
THEY MADE THEIR CANOES FROM THE TRUNKS OF LARGE TREES 
THEY LIVED BY HUNTING FARMING AND FISHING 
AND GUESS WHAT MY DADDY STILL FARMS AND BUILDS CANOES TODAY 
HE WAS TAUGHT BY HIS DADDY WHO WAS TAUGHT BY HIS DADDY 
I'M GOING TO LEARN HOW TO BUILD A DUG OUT CANOE 
SUSAN IS HEADING FOR THE FOREST IN SEARCH OF A TREE TO BUILD HER CANOE 
THERE'S ONLY SO FAR YOU CAN DRIVE 
RIVERS HAVE TO BE CROSSED 
AND I'LL TELL YOU IT IS NO EASY TASK TREKKING THROUGH THE FOREST 
PATHS HAVE TO BE TRODDEN THROUGH COCONUT GROVES AND BANANA TREES 
RIGHT INTO THE HEART OF THE FOREST 
YOU GET IT ON THE TREE ITSELF SO YOU JUST REMOVE IT LIKE THAT 
I AM NAPOLEON SUSAN'S DADDY 
I FIRST HELPED MY FATHER BUILD A CANOE WHEN I WAS ABOUT EIGHT 
WHEN MY FATHER FIRST SHOWED ME HOW TO CHOP A TREE HE USED AN AXE 
IT TOOK HIM A DAY NOW WE USE A CHAINSAW WITH THE AXE 
THIS TREE SHOULD FALL DOWN IN HALF AN HOUR 
WHEN IT FALLS WE'LL BUILD A BOAT RIGHT HERE IN THE FOREST 
ALL THE BOATS ARE MADE TO MEASURE 
WHEN THE TREE IS CHOPPED IT'S CUT TO THE RIGHT LENGTH AND CUT IN HALF 
O. K. 
YES DADDY 
WE USE THE CHAINSAW TO TAKE OUT THE INSIDE 
AFTER A LONG DAY IN THE FOREST YOU'RE OWED A LITTLE BIT OF FUN 
CANOES STILL HAVE TO BE DRAGGED THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH THOUGH 
THEY'RE LAUNCHED BY THE SEA AT BAYS LIKE ATKINSON BAY 
AT A BAY IN THE CARIB TERRITORY YOU'D EXPECT TO SEE LOTS OF CANOES 
THEY ARE THERE BUT IN DISGUISE 
THIS IS THE CANOE BASE HIGH SIDES ARE ADDED TO MAKE IT INTO A BOAT 
IT'S STILL CALLED A DUGOUT CANOE 
WITH THE HIGHER SIDES IT'S SAFER TO SAIL THE ROUGH ATLANTIC SEA 
THERE WE GO WHEE 
WE FARM AND FISH FOR MOST OF OUR FOOD 
IN THE SAME WAY MY ANCESTORS HAVE DONE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
AS SUSAN GOES FISHING WITH HER DAD 
IT'S GOODBYE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE CARIBBEAN WHATEVER THEIR ROOTS 
AND TO ALL THOSE WHO TAKE THEIR PAST ON BOARD AND SAIL INTO THE FUTURE 
MAKING THE CARIBBEAN THE MIX OF PEOPLE AND CULTURES IT IS SEE YOU
