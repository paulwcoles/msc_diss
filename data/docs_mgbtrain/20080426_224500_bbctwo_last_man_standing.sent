THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS STRONG LANGUAGE 
SIX YOUNG ATHLETES HAVE ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE OF A LIFETIME 
TO TRAVEL THE WORLD AND COMPETE AGAINST THE MOST REMOTE TRIBES ON EARTH 
ON THEIR OWN TERMS 
I AM REALLY BRICKIN' IT 
OH SHIT I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE WE'RE GOING 
ALL SIX MEN ARE MASTERS IN THEIR CHOSEN FIELDS 
COVERING THE HEAVY LIFTING BRAD BRINGS THE BRAWN 
YEAH I'M A STRONG MAN 
EVERY COMPETITION YOU ARE YOUR ONE MAN ARMY 
OXFORD GRADUATE RICHARD IS ENGLISH GRIT 
I LOVE TO WIN I HATE LOSING NICE ONE 
JASON'S A CHAMPION B. M. X. SPRINTER WHO'S FOUGHT HIS WAY TO THE TOP 
THE OLD PHRASE CAN'T BEAT 'EM JOIN 'EM 
I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE IN THAT 
CAN'T BEAT 'EM YOU CHEAT 
MARK IS ALL TECHNIQUE 
A SALSA DANCER WITH A PUNCH 
I'M PRETTY GOOD AT EVERYTHING THAT I DO 
COREY'S A HARVARD EDUCATED SCIENTIST 
I USE MY BRAIN BEFORE MY MUSCLES AND A TOP ENDURANCE ATHLETE 
CONQUERED 
AND RAJKO'S A FITNESS GURU WITH A BODY HONED TO PERFECTION 
I WANT TO ACHIEVE MY OPTIMUM AS A PHYSICAL BEING 
OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS ALL SIX WILL BE PUT THROUGH HELL 
WILL THEIR WESTERN SKILLS COUNT FOR ANYTHING CAN'T BREATHE 
AS THEY'RE HURLED INTO A WORLD OF TRIBAL SPORT AND RITUAL 
UNLIKE ANYTHING THEY'VE EVER SEEN 
COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BE THE LAST MAN STANDING 
IT'S THE FINAL DESTINATION AND OUR ATHLETES ARE TRAVELLING TO THEIR MOST REMOTE LOCATION YET 
THE DENSE JUNGLE OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA 
LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS IT'S GONNA BE HARDCORE 
THE GUYS ARE COMING TO THE END OF A COMPETITION THAT'S TAKEN THEM TO EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD 
WE'RE IN THE FREAKIN' JUNGLE MAN 
SO FAR EVERYONE HAS AT LEAST ONE WIN 
OH EXCEPT THIS BLOKE 
IT JUST SEEMS UNNECESSARY 
BUT WITH TWO WINS EACH BRAD AND RAJKO STILL HOLD THE LEAD 
SO AS WE REACH THE LAST OF EIGHT COMPETITIONS THERE'S EVERYTHING TO PLAY FOR IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA 
ASSUMING THE HEAT DOESN'T GET THEM FIRST 
I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE HOTTEST PLACES I'VE EVER BEEN 
IT'S REALLY HOT THEY KNOW THEY'RE IN THE JUNGLE 
WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW IS THAT THEY'RE ABOUT THE FACE THE TOUGHEST OF ALL THEIR CHALLENGES 
THEY'RE ABOUT TO MEET THE KARAWARI A REMOTE TRIBE WITH A PARTICULAR SKILL ON THE WATER 
AND IN JUST FIVE DAYS OUR BOYS WILL HAVE TO MASTER THAT SKILL IN KARAWARI DUG OUT CANOES 
READY FOR AN INTENSE TWO DAY RACE THROUGH THE SWELTERING CROCODILE INFESTED JUNGLE 
OUR ATHLETES WILL LIVE HERE IN YIMAS A TRADITIONAL KARAWARI VILLAGE 
THEY DON'T GET MANY VISITORS SO THE CLAN ELDER HAS MADE A SPECIAL EFFORT 
LIKE MANY OF THE KARAWARI HE'S TAKEN A WESTERN NAME 
MEET DOMINIC 
THANK YOU SO MUCH 
WE'VE NEVER SEEN PEOPLE LIKE THIS 
THE VILLAGERS WILL DO THEIR BEST TO TURN OUR SIX INTO REAL MEN OF THE JUNGLE 
EACH ATHLETE WILL STAY IN A DIFFERENT HOME AND BE OFFICIALLY ADOPTED AS A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY 
OH THAT'S GREAT 
YEAH IT FEELS LIKE I'M GETTING MARRIED 
TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE TRIALS AHEAD 
THE GUYS WILL NEED ALL THE SUPPORT THEIR NEW FAMILIES CAN GIVE 
DOES EVERYBODY LIVE HERE EVERYBODY IN MY FAMILY YEAH 
ALL RIGHT MY FAMILY 
WHAT AN AMAZING PLACE THIS IS 
PROBABLY THE MOST TRIBAL THING WE'VE BEEN TO 
YOU EXPECT PEOPLE LIKE THAT TO 
UM TO BE PEERING THROUGH THE BUSHES AT YOU WITH BLOWPIPES 
WE HAD A COOL LITTLE JOURNEY INTO THIS SPOT 
THE MOST UNSTURDY CANOES I'VE EVER BEEN ON IN MY LIFE 
AND I HOPE WE DON'T HAVE TO MESS WITH THOSE ANY TIME SOON 
BAD NEWS FOR BRAD BECAUSE IT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO MESS WITH 
MASTERING A KARAWARI CANOE A SKILL THE LOCALS LEARN THE MOMENT THEY CAN WALK 
NICELY DONE 
OUR SIX HAVE JUST A WEEK BEFORE THEY TAKE ON THE CREAM OF LOCAL CANOEISTS 
THIS MAN WILL GET THEM READY AN UNDISPUTED CHAMPION OF THE RIVER HE'S CALLED PAUL 
RUGGED THIS IS GONNA BE SICK 
HE MAKES IT LOOK EASY BUT CONTROLLING A DUGOUT 
TAKES BALANCE TECHNIQUE AND INTENSE CONCENTRATION 
I THINK YOU'VE HAD MORE EXPERIENCE WITH THIS THAN YOU'RE LETTING ON THAT 
WHERE IN BIRMINGHAM AM I GOING TO DO THAT 
PAUL WANTS TO CHECK OUT EACH ATHLETE IN TURN TO SEE WHAT HE HAS TO WORK WITH 
HMM NO PRESSURE THEN 
YOU YOU COME ACROSS THERE SINK OR SWIM 
LOOK AT THAT OLD GUY IT'S NOT THAT HARD 
NO 
I THOUGHT IT'D BE MUCH EASIER THAN THAT 
CAN'T BELIEVE HOW RUBBISH I AM 
RAJKO ISN'T USED TO BEING RUBBISH 
HE CAME IN AS THE GROUP'S MOST CONFIDENT AND GIFTED ATHLETE 
AND HE'S GOT THE TRIBAL TROPHIES TO BACK IT UP 
BUT THIS CONTEST HAS TAUGHT OUR WALKING EGOS SOMETHING NEW 
A SPOT OF SPORTING HUMILITY 
I FEEL WEAK I THOUGHT I WAS STRONG 
I FEEL UNSKILFUL EVEN THOUGH I THOUGHT I WAS SKILFUL 
WE'RE GETTING THROWN INTO SITUATIONS WHERE YOU HAVE TO BE CRAP AT SOMETHING AGAIN 
IF RAJKO WINS HERE HE TAKES THE WHOLE CONTEST 
BUT NOT IF HE KEEPS DOING THAT 
I DON'T IMAGINE IT BEING THAT HARD 
EVER SAID SOMETHING YOU IMMEDIATELY REGRET 
IT'S NOT THAT HARD IT'S NOT THAT HARD 
THERE YOU GO JACE 
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANTED TO SEE 
LET'S DO IT OH OH 
OH MY GOD 
I CAN'T DO IT OH THIS IS GONNA BE ROCK HARD 
AT LEAST THERE ARE FOUR OTHERS TO UPHOLD THE ATHLETES' HONOUR 
COME ON WHAT IS THIS ABOUT 
IT'S JUST HARD WORK SWIMMING AND TRYING TO KEEP YOUR BALANCE 
AND I'M RIDICULOUSLY POOR AT IT 
AND BRAD 
OH DEAR OH ARGH 
DAMN IT I'M NOT EVEN CONCENTRATING ANY MORE IT'S JUST FUCKING IRRITATING 
BUT NOT EVERYONE IS LAUGHING 
LOOKING GOOD LOOKING GOOD 
THE GROUP'S PRIDE NOW RESTS ON RICHARD'S SLENDER SHOULDERS 
GOOD JOB RICH 
LOOK HOW PROUD HE LOOKS I KNOW 
HE'S JUST LIKE OH THESE AMATEURS YEAH 
HE'S DOING GOOD 
HE DID GOOD THOUGH LOOK AT HIM POP BACK IN 
HE'S TRYING HARD WELL HE'S RICH 
OXFORD EDUCATED RICHARD HAS GONE TRIBAL TO SHOW THAT POSH BOYS AREN'T SOFT 
I'M VERY VERY KEEN TO SHOW FROM THE OUTSET THAT I'M SOMEONE 
THAT CAN ROUGH IT WITH THE BEST 
BUT HE'S SPENT MUCH OF HIS TIME GETTING BASHED 
IT'S SCARY 
THAT IS UNTIL SENEGAL WHEN HE SURPRISED EVERYONE WITH A FIRST RATHER UNEXPECTED WIN 
NOW HE KNOWS HE'S GOT A REAL SHOT TO TIE FOR THE TITLE 
RIGHT NOW RICHARD'S FEELING PRETTY PLEASED WITH HIMSELF 
BUT AS NIGHT FALLS PAUL ISN'T CONVINCED ABOUT ANY OF THEM 
BOY WAS IT A BASTARD 
I NEVER IMAGINED IT'D BE SO HARD JUST TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP 
IN THAT PIECE LET ALONE BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY PADDLE 
IT WAS KIND OF LIKE STANDING IN A DRAINPIPE 
AND IT'S NOT GREAT FOR BALANCE 
IT'S GOING TO NEED A LOT OF PRACTICE AND I'M REALLY HOPING TO PRACTISE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 
IN JUST FOUR DAYS CANOEISTS FROM ACROSS THE REGION WILL DESCEND ON YIMAS FOR A MARATHON TWO DAY RACE 
THE LOCALS KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT BUT SO FAR NO ONE'S ACTUALLY MENTIONED IT TO OUR ATHLETES 
AND FRANKLY PAUL ISN'T SURE ANY OF THEM WILL EVEN MAKE IT TO THE START 
SO HE'S TAKING DRASTIC ACTION 
OUT WITH THE RACING CANOES AND IN WITH SOMETHING A BIT LESS SPORTY 
O. K. O. K. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
HE'S HONEST WHICH IS IMPORTANT YEAH 
HE DOESN'T TRY AND PRETEND THAT WE'RE ANY GOOD AT THE MOMENT 
PAUL'S JUST SPELT IT OUT TO ME FROM AN EXPERT'S POINT OF VIEW THAT I WAS ABSOLUTELY CRAP 
EVERYONE HAS BEEN STRIPPED OF THEIR KARAWARI FERRARIS AND GIVEN THE VOLVO ESTATE OF CANOES 
I THINK IT'LL BE QUITE EASY NOW 
BUT WILL IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE 
I WAS TALKING ALL BIG A FEW SECONDS AGO BUT IT'S EVEN STILL DIFFICULT ON THIS 
AS SOON AS YOU GOT ON HERE IT'S LIKE WOO WOO 
EVENTUALLY IT SEEMS THE EASIER CANOES HAVE AN EFFECT 
THAT AND THE FEAR OF CROCODILES 
AFTER A FEW HOURS EVERYONE STARTS TO LOOK MORE LIKE A KARAWARI 
EVERYONE THAT IS 
EXCEPT BRAD DAMN IT 
GO ON BRAD 
THE MORE YOU STAY TENSE THE MORE YOU TIRE YOURSELF OUT 
AND ONCE YOU'RE TIRED YOU'RE SCREWED 
I'M NOT GIVING UP I'M GONNA LEARN HOW TO DO THIS I'M SHOWING US UP 
I'M USED TO ABUSING MYSELF 
I'M A STRONGMAN BABY GONNA MAKE IT HAPPEN 
BUT JASON'S CLOCKED THE ATHLETE THAT'S REALLY MAKING STUFF HAPPEN 
RICHARD'S DOING AWESOME HE'S KICKING ASS 
BUT WHAT OUR ATHLETES HAVEN'T REALISED IS THAT BALANCING IS ACTUALLY THE EASY PART 
IN THE RACE THEY'LL HAVE TO PADDLE UPSTREAM 
BACK IN THE CURRENT IT'S REALLY 
YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY ENERGY SAPPING AND 
YOU TRY TO BE DEMANDING ON YOUR CORE IT'S LIKE DOING LOTS AND LOTS OF SIT UPS 
I SENSE THAT YOU FEEL YOU HAVE A CHANCE WHICH I THINK IS TOTALLY UNFOUNDED 
BUT IT'S INTERESTING FOR ME 
I'D SAY IF WE RACED RIGHT NOW I'D LEAVE YOU FOR DEAD 
RICHARD MIGHT GET A CHANCE TO PROVE HE'S RIGHT 
BY THE END OF THE AFTERNOON PAUL DECIDES THREE OF OUR ATHLETES ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR A TEST 
YOU YOU 
YOU 
IT'S THEIR FIRST CHANCE TO PIT THEMSELVES AGAINST ONE ANOTHER 
WHERE ARE WE RACING 
CLOSE CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TOO CLOSE 
THE IMPROMPTU CONTEST HAS ATTRACTED QUITE A CROWD 
O. K. READY GO NOW 
THE SHORT DISTANCE IMMEDIATELY DOUBLES BECAUSE NO ONE HAS QUITE MASTERED THE SKILL OF STEERING 
GET OUT OF THE HOLE RICH GET OUT THE HOLE 
PADDLE COREY RUN HIM OVER 
GET YOUR NOSE IN FRONT OF THEM YOU GO GET IT YEAH 
HE BEAT HIM BY A NOSE 
THEY MUSTERED ME OUT IT WAS A. 
TERRIBLE GANG UP 
EVERYONE BELIEVES COREY'S THE WINNER WELL ALMOST EVERYONE 
VICTORIOUS NO NO NO NO VICTORIOUS 
NOW YOUR CANOE CURVED AT THE TREE 
WHERE WAS THE RACE TO THE TREE NO 
AH HEY HEY IF YOU WANNA CHEAT YOU CAN BE THE VICTOR 
IF YOU WANT TO JUST KEEP PADDLING OFF TO THE END OF RACE I'LL ACCEPT A TIE 
I WON'T ACCEPT A TIE IT WAS A CLEAR VICTORY YOU JUST KEPT PADDLING AFTER TO THE CORNER 
OH YOU LOSER THERE WAS A PLAIN YOU DID NOT CROSS BECAUSE YOU ALMOST FELL IN THE WATER IT'S STILL GOING 
IT'S ALL RIGHT RAJKO 
NO NO YOU WIN YOU WIN COMPLETELY 
NO I'LL GIVE THE VICTORY TO YOU IF IT'S THAT IMPORTANT NO NO I INSIST 
RAJKO ISN'T USED TO LOSING AND COREY ISN'T USED TO WINNING 
SCIENCEY BRAIN BOX COREY IS THE ONLY ATHLETE STILL WITHOUT A WIN 
IF IT COMES DOWN TO A STRENGTH COMPETITION I'M THE WEAKLING 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST HIS STRENGTH THAT'S LET HIM DOWN 
DUCKING OUT OF A MEXICAN MARATHON 
I GOTTA END IT THERE AND STRIKING OUT IN A GAME OF TRIBAL CRICKET 
BUT WITH ALL THESE BOATING EXPERIENCE A CANOE RACE MIGHT JUST SAVE COREY'S PRIDE 
SO FAR OUR ATHLETES HAVE PADDLED ONLY A FEW HUNDRED METRES 
THEY STILL DON'T KNOW THAT THE RACE WILL BE MUCH MUCH FURTHER 
PAUL IS READY TO BREAK THE BAD NEWS 
WHAT 
ALL RIGHT 
HE SAID TWO DAYS 
AND TO MAKE IT MORE INTERESTING THE LAST TWO TO CROSS 
THE FINISH LINE ON DAY ONE WILL BE ELIMINATED AND WON'T BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE ON THE SECOND DAY 
THAT'S SICK 
AS THE SKIES DARKEN SO DOES OUR ATHLETES' MOOD 
IT IS VERY VERY DAUNTING KNOWING THAT IT'S OVER TWO DAYS 
MY GOD I STRUGGLED JUST TO GET UP LIKE A HUNDRED METRES OF THE RIVER UPSTREAM 
SO I NEED TO IMPROVE FAST 
EACH OF THESE DAYS WE'RE LOOKING 
AT CANOEING FOR ABOUT SIX HOURS 
I THINK AT MY CURRENT LEVEL 
THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT 
NOW THAT CHANGES THE LANDSCAPE OF THE WHOLE EVENT SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE 
IT'S NOW NOT JUST ABOUT TECHNIQUE IT'S MASSIVELY ABOUT STAMINA 
THIS IS THE RIVER OUR ATHLETES WILL HAVE TO CONQUER IN JUST THREE DAYS' TIME 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE CANOEING THEY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT 
AFTER STRUGGLING UPSTREAM ON DAY ONE OF THE RACE 
THEY'LL BE FORCED TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN THE DENSE JUNGLE 
BEFORE PADDLING ALL THE WAY BACK TO THEIR VILLAGE THE NEXT DAY 
SO TODAY THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN TO MAKE SHELTERS AND FIND FOOD 
FIRST OFF RICHARD AND BRAD ARE TAKEN HUNTING IN THE SWAMP 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE REALLY GETTING INTO BY THE LOOK OF THOSE WEAPONS IT LOOKS BIG 
WE'RE GONNA BE IN THE SHIT IF WE'RE GOING FOR A GATOR 
CATCH 'EM WHILE THEY'RE SLEEPING HOW WOULD YOU HAVE AN ARGUMENT 
WITH A ALLIGATOR JUST HIT IM ON THE HEAD 
ACTUALLY THEIR GUIDE BEN HAS SOMETHING A BIT SMALLER IN MIND 
GRUBS RIGHT 
I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE EATING SOME INSECTS MAN 
FANTASTIC 
THIS IS A FOR REAL JUNGLE MAN 
BRAD AND RICHARD ARE TOLD TO LOOK FOR GRUBS IN ROTTEN LOGS 
IF THE WOOD SOUNDS HOLLOW IT'S DINNER TIME 
FINDING A LOG IS THE EASY PART 
OH MAN 
LOOK PRETTY SOLID DOESN'T IT YEAH 
ACTUALLY GETTING THE GRUBS IS MUCH HARDER 
OH SHIT 
OH WE'RE FUCKED 
YOU SEE HIM YES 
A FEW HOURS LATER 
THERE HE IS 
THAT'S HORRIBLE THAT'S FILTHY 
OH I GOT ANOTHER ONE 
OH 
FAT BOY 
O. K. OVERGROWN MAGGOT WITH A BIG ASS HEAD 
THAT'S GOT TO BE THE MOST REVOLTING THING I'VE EVER SEEN 
BRAD AND RICHARD ARE SLIGHTLY EMBARRASSED BY THEIR MEASLY FOOD HAUL 
I WARN YOU THEY'RE NOT 
IT MIGHT NOT BE WHAT YOU'RE EXPECTING YEAH 
BUT GRUB CONNOISSEUR BEN IS DELIGHTED 
WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE 
TASTES GOOD TASTES GOOD 
AND HE WANTS TO SHARE OH THAT'S ONE OF THE 
VERY GOOD YES I TRUST YOU MAN 
THERE YOU GO 
THAT FACE SAYS A LOT MM 
FILTHY THAT'S BIG YOU'VE GOT A FAT BOY 
THIS IS DELICIOUS 
OH LISTEN TO THAT CRUNCH 
HMM M. M. 
IT'S SURPRISING 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WAS ER 
OH WOW THAT WAS AMAZING REALLY 
WITH DELICIOUS SNACKS SECURED IT'S TIME FOR THE SECOND PART OF TODAY'S LESSON 
ALL SIX ARE TAKEN DEEP INTO THE JUNGLE 
COME THE RACE THEY'LL HAVE TO MAKE THEIR OWN JUNGLE SHELTERS AND THIS IS THE CRASH COURSE IN HOW TO DO IT 
TIE IT UP THERE AND THEN YOU GO UP THIS WAY 
AS A TEST EACH ATHLETE HAS TO MAKE THEIR OWN SHELTER 
ONE SLEEPS HERE 
AND SLEEP IN IT TONIGHT 
AS LONG AS WE DON'T RUN OUT OF TIME I THINK IT WE'LL GET IT 
THERE'S JUST TWO HOURS TILL NIGHTFALL 
BUT JASON HAS A PLAN 
IF WE ALL WORK TOGETHER STARTING ON THE FIRST HUT 
THEN WE JUST WORK TOGETHER WE WON'T END UP AS A BUNCH OF UNCOMPLETE HUTS 
WELL THE COMMUNITY'S ALL ABOUT WORKING TOGETHER AND SHARING SO 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO THEN THERE'S JUST ONE ANNOYING PROBLEM 
I REALLY WANT TO DO IT MYSELF 
THE OTHERS WERE TALKING ABOUT 
DOING IT TOGETHER SO WE DO IT QUICKER AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT 
IN THOSE SITUATIONS I FIND OTHER PEOPLE TAKE OVER 
IT'LL BE A POSSIBILITY THAT WE'RE ALL SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THAT 
THIS AIN'T THE CANOE RACE RIGHT HERE 
BUT IT IS A RACE AGAINST THE FADING LIGHT 
IT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY HARD 
GETTING A LITTLE PARANOID ABOUT TIME 
AND TIME ISN'T THE ONLY WORRY 
I WAS AT ARM'S LENGTH SCUFFLING THROUGH THE LEAVES AND THERE WAS A DEATH ADDER RIGHT UNDERNEATH ME 
NOW I'M OFFICIALLY SHITTING MY PANTS 
SAKI WANTS EVERYONE TO SEE WHAT COULD BE LURKING UNDER THEIR PILLOWS 
WE'RE SLEEPING OUT IN THE OPEN IN A JUNGLE 
PLENTY OF SNAKES PLENTY OF SPIDERS PLENTY OF BUGS AND ALL WE'VE GOT TO SEPARATE US IS A HUT PHEW 
DOESN'T GET ANY MORE REALLER THAN THAT 
DESPITE THE TIGHT DEADLINE EVERYONE FINISHES THEIR SHELTER BEFORE DARK 
SO RICHARD AND BRAD CRACK OUT THE CELEBRATORY BUFFET 
OH NO 
NO LOOK AT THAT 
THIS IS ALL WE'VE GOT MAN 
ARE YOU SERIOUS 
THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME 
JUST DO IT MAN OH I'M GOING HUNGRY TONIGHT 
REALLY 
IT'S JUST A GRUB IT'S JUST A GRUB IF THEY CAN DO IT I CAN DO IT 
WHY IS HE STILL ALIVE DISGUSTING 
IT'S GOOD MAN 
JUST THE FEEL OF IT IS 
THAT FEELS LIKE A TESTICLE 
ARE YOU GONNA THROW UP DON'T DO IT YOU DON'T HAVE TO EAT IT MAN 
HANDLE IT COME ON 
ON THREE ONE TWO THREE 
OH 
IT'S GOOD THOUGH MAN YOU HAVEN'T ATE ONE 
THEY'VE GOT THROUGH DINNER NOW THEY JUST NEED TO GET THROUGH THE NIGHT 
HEAR THAT 
THERE'S SO MANY NOISES GOING ON 
I DEFINITELY HAVE IMAGES 
OF SNAKE SMOOTH CREEPING UP BESIDE ME WANTING A CHEW 
A SPIDER'S JUST JUMPED AT ME AND JASON AND HE CRAPPED HIMSELF 
YEAH BUDDY 
AFTER A NIGHT IN THE JUNGLE IT'S A RELIEF TO GET BACK ON THE CROCODILE INFESTED RIVER 
IT'S NOW JUST TWO DAYS UNTIL THE BIG RACE 
FAVOURITES RAJKO COREY AND RICHARD CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THEIR SUCCESS 
WHILST THE OTHERS TRY HARD TO CATCH UP 
JASON IS SHOWING IMPRESSIVE TECHNIQUE 
BUT HE'S EASILY DISTRACTED AND HE CAN'T STOP MUCKING ABOUT 
I CHALLENGE YOU TO A DUEL 
WHEN WE'RE NEXT TO EACH OTHER HE'S MORE FOCUSED ON 
TRYING TO WIN AND I'M MORE FOCUSED ON JUST FUCKING AROUND AND HAVING A GOOD TIME 
B. M. X. BRAWLER JASON HAS JUST ONE WIN TO HIS NAME A KICK FIGHT IN NORTHERN INDIA 
OFTEN THE FAVOURITE JASON'S NEVER BEEN BIG ON HUMILITY 
I'M NOT REALLY THAT COCKY WHEN I WIN 
YES YOU ARE BUT HIS RESULTS HAVE RARELY MATCHED THE HYPE 
HE GOT OUT 
I DIDN'T MAKE IT 
TOOK ME OUT MAN 
AIN'T NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT THAT 
IF JASON KNUCKLES DOWN HE COULD BE A SERIOUS CONTENDER 
WITH A CHANCE TO TIE FOR THE TITLE 
BUT THE OTHERS AREN'T GOING TO MAKE IT EASY FOR HI M. 
MARK'S BEEN GETTING EXTRA TUITION FROM HIS TRIBE DAD NOAH 
AND IT'S PAYING OFF 
YEAH 
EVEN ONCE STRUGGLING BRAD IS STARTING TO SHOW SOME SURPRISING FORM 
HE'S DOING A LOT BETTER 
THAT ASS IS ACTUALLY STAYING ON THE BOAT 
GOOD JOB MAN HEY WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME COMPETITION 
THE VILLAGERS ARE IMPRESSED 
FOR JASON SEEING HOW MUCH THE OTHERS HAVE IMPROVED IS A BIG WAKE UP CALL 
I WASN'T REALLY FOCUSING I WAS JUST HAVING FUN SO I NEED TO STOP 
I WAS REALLY THINKING 
JUST DO IT YOU KNOW 
I REALLY WANT TO WIN THIS ONE SO I NEED TO STOP STOP FUCKING AROUND AND DO THAT 
BUT WITH RACE DAY LOOMING JASON'S TIME IS RUNNING OUT 
THE RACE IS AT THE TOP OF EVERYONE'S MIND APART FROM BRAD'S 
IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY AND HE'S DREAMING OF HOME 
HE'S MISSING HIS DAUGHTER AMETHYST AND HIS PREGNANT WIFE HEATHER 
BRAD LEFT OKLAHOMA TO TAKE ON THE WORLD JUST TO MAKE HIS FAMILY PROUD 
HE'S MY ACTION HERO 
AND WITH TWO WINS HE'S DONE JUST THAT 
BUT HE'S ALWAYS NEEDED A LITTLE INSPIRATION FROM BACK HOME 
MY DAUGHTER AMETHYST I WANT HER TO BE PROUD OF ME 
AND NOW HE'S MISSING HIS FAMILY MORE THAN EVER 
HEATHER'S PREGNANT AGAIN AND DEALING WITH EVERYTHING HERSELF 
SHE'S ALREADY BEEN TO TWO DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS 
AND I HAVEN'T MADE IT TO ANY SO IT'S A TRIP IT'S A TRIP 
BRAD'S TRIBE FAMILY WANT TO CHEER UP THEIR GLOOMY HOUSE GUEST 
SO THEY GET EVERYONE FROM THE VILLAGE TOGETHER AND ORGANISE A SPECIAL BIRTHDAY SURPRISE 
HEY THIS IS LOVE 
THE LOCAL BAND HAS EVEN WRITTEN A SPECIAL BIRTHDAY SONG IN ENGLISH 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BRAD HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
THANK YOU THAT'S BEAUTIFUL 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY BRAD 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BRADLEY HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
BRAD THANKS THE VILLAGERS IN TEXTBOOK PIDGIN ENGLISH 
I'M ON CLOUD NINE RIGHT NOW CAN'T GET ANY BETTER 
JUST A BEAUTIFUL THING THE WHOLE TRIBE SHOWING UP AND SHOWING ME LOVE THE WAY THEY DID 
AND YOU KNOW DAMN NEAR DROPPED A TEAR 
IT'S THE DAY BEFORE THE RACE 
AND IN THE VILLAGE LAST MINUTE PREPARATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE 
TOMORROW MORNING CANOEISTS FROM ACROSS THE KARAWARI WILL BE ARRIVING TO COMPETE 
FOR OUR ATHLETES IT'S THE LAST FULL DAY 
OF PRACTICE BEFORE THE COMPETITION AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE ARMING THEM WITH WEAPONS TO DO BATTLE 
HEY YOUR PRESENT 
AH MAN 
THANK YOU SO MUCH 
WOW 
THE SYMBOL OF THE VILLAGE 
SYMBOL OF THE CLAN RIGHT ON 
THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU ARE WELCOME HOPEFULLY THIS WILL HELP ME WIN 
WITH THE CANOES AND PADDLES THEY'LL ACTUALLY RACE WITH PAUL SENDS THEM OUT FOR ONE LAST PRACTICE 
A SHORT DASH UPSTREAM AND BACK 
COREY RICHARD GO 
THE CROCODILE SPOTTERS ARE ON HIGH ALERT AS JASON AND COREY TUMBLE IN 
SHORTLY FOLLOWED BY MARK 
RAJKO TAKES THE LEAD 
AND WHILE THE OTHERS STRUGGLE HE'S ALREADY HEADING FOR HOME 
BUT THE BIG SURPRISE IS BRAD 
WHO MUSCLES HIMSELF INTO SECOND PLACE 
RAJKO CLAIMS AN EFFORTLESS VICTORY 
AND WITH BRAD TAKING SECOND THE TWO OVERALL CONTEST LEADERS ARE LOOKING STRONG 
CONGRATS HOMIE BUT RAJKO'S THE CLEAR FAVOURITE 
I STAYED CLEAR OF ALL THE MESS 
I WANT TO RACE AGAIN I WANNA REACH OUT I CAN'T HANDLE IT 
I WAS VERY RELAXED JUST USING MY BODY INSTEAD OF MY ARMS AND IT WASN'T THAT TIRING 
MY KNEES ARE BUCKLING JUST AFTER THAT LITTLE SPRINT I CAN'T IMAGINE OVER THE WHOLE LONG HAUL 
THAT LONG IN A RACE IS REALLY GONNA TAKE IT OUT 
I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE I COULD GO QUITE FAR 
IF RAJKO WINS THE BIG RACE HE TAKES THE OVERALL TITLE 
I'M REALLY HOPING RAJKO'S NOT GONNA WIN 
SO SEEING HIM COMING FIRST WAS KIND OF A BLOW TO MY EGO 
I THINK THE REASON RAJKO WON IS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T PANIC 
DIDN'T GET OVERCONFIDENT MANAGED TO KEEP HIS 
DIDN'T DO THAT RIDICULOUS NONSENSE WHERE HE STANDS ON BOTH SIDES 
OR YOU KNOW BIT LIKE AN ARSEHOLE 
SNEAKING IN SOME INSULTS HERE 
VERY GOOD 
WELL I FEEL PRETTY GOOD PRETTY DAMN GOOD 
SEE THIS IS THE PROBLEM 
THIS IS HIS BIGGEST FAULT WHAT CAN I SAY 
THIS IS WHAT WILL UNDO YOU TOMORROW 
BEFORE ANY IMPORTANT EVENT THE KARAWARI PERFORM ANCIENT RITUALS 
AND THREE OF OUR ATHLETES HAVE BEEN INVITED TO A NEIGHBOURING VILLAGE TO JOIN IN 
THIS FRIENDLY WELCOME IS DESIGNED TO TEST THEIR BRAVERY 
THERE WAS A MOMENT JUST THEN WHERE HE DAMN NEARLY HIT MY EYE BEHIND ME 
SO IT GETS THE PULSES RACING THAT KIND OF WELCOME 
THE KARAWARI SPIRIT HOUSE IS A SACRED PLACE 
WHERE MEN OF THE TRIBE ARE INITIATED 
WE'RE ABOUT TO BE GIVEN A SPECIAL SPIRITUAL WORD THAT'S GOING TO GIVE US POWER 
AND WE HAVE TO KEEP IT SECRET FROM ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE OF THE VILLAGE 
THE WOMEN THE CHILDREN ESPECIALLY 
OTHERWISE IT WON'T WORK 
AND IF WE'RE FEELING REALLY TIRED TOMORROW DURING THE RACE 
WE CAN WHISPER THAT WORD AND IT'LL GIVE US EXTRA POWERS 
AH THAT'S GOOD 
WEEBONGA 
WEEBONGONAH THANK YOU 
MENDAR 
MENDARHOO MENDARHOO 
CAUGHT UP IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE MOMENT 
RICHARD MAKES A BIT OF A FAUX PAS 
KOMANJAH 
KOMANJAH YES 
KOMANJAH 
ME MENDARHOO 
SSH SECRET MENDARHOO 
DON'T TELL HIM OR HIM 
HEY WHAT DID YOU SAY 
THE MAGIC WORD THE WORD 
MENDARHOO WIN THE RIGHT MAN 
THE RIGHT MAN 
THEY SAID EXPLICITLY DO NOT TELL WOMEN AND CHILDREN 
HE JUST CAME OUT AND ANNOUNCED HIS WORD TO ALL THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN ARMS RAISED 
BUT THAT'S WHY THEY BEFRIENDED YOU IT WAS BECAUSE I BETRAYED THE OTHER GUYS 
IT'S A CONSOLATION IT'S SHOCKING 
WELL NOW MAYBE I'VE CAST MYSELF AS A. 
IF I LOSE TOMORROW THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT CAN HAVE GONE WRONG 
LATER BACK IN THE VILLAGE PAUL DECIDES IT'S TIME TO GO THROUGH A FEW MINOR DETAILS 
THE SECOND DAY WILL BE DOWNSTREAM 
BUT TWICE AS LONG AT FOURTEEN KILOMETRES 
RIGHT 
SOUNDS GOOD 
TODAY RAJKO WAS THE CLEAR LEADER AND BRAD SHOWED HIS MUSCLE 
BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES BRIMMING WITH CONFIDENCE 
I'M CERTAINLY NOT SAYING I'M GONNA WIN IT BUT DON'T RULE ME OUT 
I'M GOING TO PUT MY MONEY ON MYSELF 
BECAUSE I I I ER 
I THINK NOW THAT GIVES ME AN EXTRA INCENTIVE TOMORROW TO DO WELL NOW 
THAT I'VE SAID THAT I REALLY HAVE TO OTHERWISE I LOOK REALLY STUPID 
BUT WITH HIS FAIR SKIN AND A HISTORY OF HEAT STROKE 
THE MAN FROM ALASKA IS NOT SO SURE 
NO MATTER HOW GOOD I AM TOMORROW'S NOT A BATTLE BETWEEN ME AND CANOEING 
IT'S A BATTLE BETWEEN ME AND THE SUN 
BETWEEN THE SUN THE DISTANCE AND FIERCE COMPETITION FROM THE LOCALS 
TOMORROW IS GOING TO BE A BATTLE ON ALL FRONTS 
TODAY THE RACE BEGINS 
IT'S THE BIGGEST EVENT OF THE YEAR AND THE BEST CANOEISTS 
FROM ACROSS THE KARAWARI ARE ARRIVING TO TAKE PART 
FOR OUR ATHLETES IT'S THE FINAL EVENT IN A TWELVE MONTH ORDEAL OF BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS 
I'M JUST GONNA TRY TO STAY FOCUSED 
I CAN'T WAIT TO DO IT AND GET IT OVER WITH 
A TWO DAY RACE THROUGH THE SUFFOCATING HEAT OF THE JUNGLE 
IT'S ALMOST MEDICALLY INSANE TO TRY THIS 
TODAY'S LEG IS SEVEN K. M. UPSTREAM AGAINST A RELENTLESS CURRENT 
IT'S GONNA COME DOWN TO ENDURANCE 
JUST GONNA TO BE A MATTER OF WHOSE MIND IS IN IT THE MOST 
WHEN THE DAY IS DONE THE LAST TWO ATHLETES WILL BE ELIMINATED 
GO 
THE START OF THE RACE WAS CHAOS 
THE WATER HAD SUDDENLY TURNED INTO AN OCEAN STORM WITH BIG WAVES 
GOING EVERYWHERE AND I TOLD MYSELF DON'T PANIC DON'T TRY AND RUSH THROUGH THIS 
THE CURRENT IS EVEN STRONGER THAN THE ATHLETES EXPECTED 
WITHIN SECONDS THE KARAWARI CANOEISTS ARE SO FAR AHEAD 
THAT FOR OUR ATHLETES IT'S NOW JUST A RACE AGAINST EACH OTHER 
AND THE STRONG CURRENT IS ALREADY CAUSING PROBLEMS 
BRAD CAN'T STEER AND IMMEDIATELY FALLS BEHIND 
RAJKO'S SO CONFIDENT HE'LL BE IN THE TOP FOUR AND SAFE FROM ELIMINATION 
THAT HE STAYS BACK TO HELP 
MY IDEA WAS THAT FROM BEHIND HIM I'LL SAY YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS 
YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS SET HIM OFF AND THEN OFF I GO 
AND THEN MY OFFER OF HELPING BRAD JUST WENT COMPLETELY WRONG 
AT THAT POINT EVERYONE'S WAY GONE BY NOW AND MY BOAT FILLED WITH WATER 
JUST TWENTY MINUTES IN AND THE FAVOURITE RAJKO 
IS SUDDENLY IN LAST PLACE AND REALLY STRUGGLING 
HALF A KILOMETRE UPSTREAM 
JASON IS CHASING MARK AND MARK IS CHASING THE LEADER RICHARD 
BUT RICHARD'S LEAD DOESN'T LAST AS HIS BRUMMIE RIVAL POWERS AHEAD 
COREY BRAD AND RAJKO ARE WAY BEHIND 
AND RAJKO'S CHANCES OF WINNING THE CONTEST OUTRIGHT ARE SLIPPING AWAY 
I SAID TO BRAD I'M SORRY I CAN'T HELP YOU 
I CAN'T EVEN HELP MYSELF AT THE MOMENT 
I WAS KIND OF ANGRY AND I WAS LIKE RIGHT GOT TO CATCH THE GUYS QUICK 
A THIRD OF THE WAY THROUGH RICHARD HAS EASED AHEAD OF MARK AGAIN 
BUT NOW IT'S JASON WHO'S IN THE LEAD 
SO I'M LIKE PADDLING HEART'S THUMPING 
AND I'M LIKE ALL RIGHT JASON DON'T FUCK IT UP MAN DON'T FUCK IT UP 
RAJKO IS GETTING DESPERATE 
IF HE FINISHES IN FIFTH PLACE HE'S OUT 
THE STIFLING CONDITIONS ARE TAKING THEIR TOLL 
I'M JUST WHERE I WANT TO BE 
NOT LAST AND I'M IN IT TO FINISH 
THIS IS A BEAST OF A TASK 
IT'S REALLY REALLY HOT 
AND I GOT A LONG WAY TO GO YET 
BY MIDDAY MANY OF THE LOCALS ARE FINISHING 
BUT JASON STILL LEADING OUR SIX IS LITTLE OVER HALFWAY 
AND WAY WAY BEHIND THINGS HAVE GONE FROM BAD TO TERRIBLE FOR RAJKO 
I GOT SETTLED AND I WAS CATCHING THESE GUYS THEN I HIT THAT STUPID TREE 
GOT STUCK UNDER IT THE BOAT GOT STUCK UNDER IT 
BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO SETTLE DOWN MENTALLY NOW 
COS I WAS REALLY PISSED OFF AT MYSELF ACTUALLY 
AND IN MY KIND OF HASTY PADDLING 
I'M FILLING THE CANOE WITH WATER AND I'M STILL DOING IT A BIT I'VE GOT TO SETTLE DOWN 
IT'S RIDICULOUS 
AT THE REAR BRAD IS GETTING NOWHERE FAST 
DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS TO BE OUT HERE 
I WANTED TO GIVE UP ABOUT AN HOUR AGO 
FOR SOME REASON I'M NOT LETTING MYSELF DO IT 
I'M RUNNING INTO THE SIDES I DON'T KNOW HOW TO CONTROL THE BOAT 
THE STREAM KEEPS CHANGING ITS DIRECTION 
WHATEVER THE HELL HAPPENS IT KEEPS THROWING ME AROUND AND I JUST KEEP 
I GO ABOUT TEN FEET AND THEN I GET BLOWN BACK ABOUT TWELVE 
AND I'M IN THE SAME DAMN SPOT 
RAJKO NEEDS TO TAKE FOURTH OR HE'S OUT OF THE RUNNING 
AND HE'S GIVING IT ALL HE'S GOT 
MEANWHILE TWO K. M. AHEAD JASON IS THE FIRST ATHLETE TO CROSS THE FINISH LINE 
I DIDN'T THINK I'D BE ABLE TO STAND UP IN A CANOE FOR TWO THREE HOURS STRAIGHT HOWEVER LONG IT WAS 
BUT I GUESS I CAN 
SHORTLY AFTERWARDS RICHARD TAKES SECOND 
AND MARK CRUISES IN THIRD 
GOOD JOB MARK YES I NEED WATER 
I REALLY NEED WATER 
THERE'S NOW JUST ONE PLACE LEFT IN TOMORROW'S FINAL 
IT WON'T BE BRAD 
BARELY HALFWAY THERE HE DECIDES TO CALL IT QUITS 
I WAS TELLING MYSELF I'M AT LEAST GONNA FINISH 
AND FAILURE IS SOMETHING HARD FOR ME TO COMPREHEND COS I DON'T FAIL 
THAT'S ONE THING I DON'T DO IS I DON'T FAIL AND I ALWAYS PUSH MYSELF TO THE LIMIT 
UNTIL I GET WHERE I WANT TO BE OR NEED TO BE FUCK 
AS FOR RAJKO HE'S STILL GOING ALL OUT TO MAKE THE FINAL CUT 
BUT AS HE CROSSES THE LINE 
HE STILL HAS NO IDEA WHETHER COREY'S AHEAD OF HIM OR BEHIND 
I'VE JUST BEEN PADDLING LIKE A LUNATIC FOR TWO HOURS 
PHEW I'M KNACKERED 
BUT LUCKILY COREY'S NOT FIRST 
I'M FOURTH AM I 
PLEASE TELL ME I'M FOURTH OH MAN 
TURNS OUT COREY WAS WAY WAY BEHIND HIM 
AND STILL IS 
NOT DEAD YET THAT'S ALL THAT COUNTS 
I'M GONNA MAKE IT 
DOESN'T MATTER HOW EASY IT WAS FOR SOME OR HOW TOUGH IT IS FOR ME 
AFTER MORE THAN SIX HOURS ON THE RIVER COREY STAGGERS HOME 
I FEEL LIKE I FEEL LIKE THE FAT KID AT THE END OF GYM PRACTICE 
OH BUDDY 
SIX HOURS COREY SIX HOURS HUH 
THIS IS NO PLACE FOR AN ALASKAN 
IT'S A NEW IT'S A NEW LOCAL RECORD 
MAN LOOK LIKE YOU LOOKED IN MEXICO 
LEAST I'M NOT SHIVERS 
WHAT'S THIS OH DUDE THAT'S HARSH IT'S ALL GOOD 
COREY AND BRAD ARE ELIMINATED AND MUST RETURN TO THEIR VILLAGE 
IT'S NOT ABOUT WINNING ANY MORE TO ME 
BEFORE IT WAS ALL ABOUT WINNING I DON'T GIVE A DAMN HOW WELL I DID 
HOW BAD I DID AS LONG AS I BEAT EVERYBODY ELSE 
GAME OVER AND NOW IT'S YOU SIT BACK 
ENJOY WHERE I'M AT ENJOY THE PEOPLE AND ABSORB THE VIBES OF THE VILLAGE 
YOU KNOW THE TRUE NOT HAVING ANYTHING BUT STILL BEING HAPPY 
YOU KNOW THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAN ANYTHING RIGHT NOW 
THE FOUR FINALISTS ARE LEFT TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN THE JUNGLE BEFORE TOMORROW'S ULTIMATE CONTEST 
AND RAJKO IS MORE DETERMINED THAN EVER 
I'M GOING TO STAY AHEAD AND I'M JUST NOT GOING TO STOP 
EVEN THOUGH HE PERFORMED LIKE SHIT TODAY 
WELL YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY HE'D BETTER BE ON HIS A GAME TOMORROW 
COS IF HE AIN'T I'M GONNA WIN THIS THING HANDS DOWN 
IT'S THE DAY OF THE FINAL 
AFTER A NIGHT IN THE JUNGLE THE FOUR REMAINING CONTENDERS 
NOW FACE A FOURTEEN K. M. RACE DOWNSTREAM AGAINST THE KARAWARI MEN 
WITH TWO WINS ALREADY IF RAJKO IS VICTORIOUS TODAY HE TAKES THE OVERALL TITLE 
BUT IF ANY OF THE OTHERS WIN THERE'LL BE A TIE 
UNLIKE SOME JASON DIDN'T GET A TRIBAL MAGIC WORD TO HELP HIM WIN 
SO HE'S COME UP WITH HIS OWN 
IT SAYS HARDER 
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE HELL I'M DOING JUST GO HARDER 
AFTER VISITING EVERY CORNER OF THE GLOBE 
AFTER A YEAR OF INTENSE COMPETITION 
IT'S THE LAST CHANCE FOR VICTORY 
READY GO 
RAJKO IMMEDIATELY STRIKES OUT IN FRONT WITH JASON JUST A FEW FEET BEHIND 
MY MAIN FOCUS WAS JUST THE FIRST FIVE OR TEN MINUTES I THOUGHT 
GOTTA GET SETTLED GET MY BALANCE RELAX NOT MAKE ANY STUPID MISTAKES 
BUT I LOST FOCUS FOR ABOUT A SECOND PROBABLY NO MORE 
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW I'M DRIFTING INTO THE SIDE VERY QUICKLY 
SO I QUICKLY TRY AND CORRECT IT BUT IT'S TOO LATE 
I HEAR RAJKO BEHIND ME FALL IN THE WATER AND ALL I COULD THINK 
IN MY MIND WAS JUST JUST KEEP PUSHING HARDER AND I JUST GRITTED MY TEETH AND WENT AS HARD AS I COULD 
BY THE TIME I GOT BACK IN THE CANOE HE WAS WAY AHEAD 
BUT STILL I WAS MENTALLY STILL WITH IT I THOUGHT WELL 
FOURTEEN KILOMETRES YOU KNOW I CAN CATCH HIM NO PROBLEM 
FUCK COME ON 
BACK IN YIMAS VILLAGE EVERYONE IS PREPARING FOR THE BIG FINISH 
WITH TWO WINS TO HIS NAME BRAD'S ONLY HOPE FOR THE OVERALL TITLE IS IF RAJKO LOSES 
MAN IF RAJKO COMES AROUND THAT CORNER FIRST 
I'M JUMPING OFF THIS CLIFF AND GETTING HIM 
COS I'M NOT LETTING HIM WIN 
HALF AN HOUR IN AND MARK IS LAST WITH RICHARD IN THIRD 
BUT RAJKO IS IN TROUBLE AGAIN 
ONE OF THE CROC SPOTTERS IS HELPING OUT BECAUSE SPLASHING AROUND IN THE SHALLOWS ISN'T A GREAT IDEA 
I MANAGED TO GET PAST HIM AND I THOUGHT BRILLIANT BECAUSE 
YOU KNOW THIS FITS MY RACE PLAN OF SLOW AND STEADY 
BUT SLOW AND STEADY IS NOT PART OF RAJKO'S PLAN 
RICHARD'S ADVANTAGE QUICKLY DISAPPEARS 
AND THREE HUNDRED METRES AHEAD JASON'S NOW IN RAJKO'S SIGHTS 
AND JASON HASN'T SPOTTED THAT RAJKO IS CLOSING THE GAP 
THE ONLY THING I SAW WAS THE LOCALS WHEN I LOOKED BEHIND ME 
AND I WAS THINKING ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IT TRULY CAN 
SO JUST KEEP DIGGING KEEP GOING YOUR HARDEST 
EIGHT KILOMETRES IN 
AND DESPITE THE PUNISHING HEAT 
RAJKO IS KEEPING UP A RELENTLESS PACE 
I THOUGHT I'M JUST GONNA GO STEADY BUT HARD 
I WAS JUST REALLY CHUGGING AWAY THINKING YEAH 
I MUST BE CATCHING HIM I DOUBT HE'S GOING FASTER THAN ME 
BY EARLY AFTERNOON THE FIRST KARAWARI COMPETITOR CROSSES THE FINISH LINE 
GOOD JOB 
MEANWHILE OUR ATHLETES STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO 
JASON IS STILL FIRST BUT HE'S PAYING THE PRICE FOR HIS EARLY PACE 
IT'S SO FUCKING HOT 
I'M JUST PUSHING MAN PUSHING 
I WAS REALLY GETTING DIZZY I WAS GETTING LIKE REALLY TINGLY FEELING 
ALL OVER MY BODY BECAUSE I WAS JUST SO DAMNED DEHYDRATED AND EXHAUSTED 
AND I WAS YOU KNOW I WAS REALLY GETTING TO A POINT WHERE I FELT LIKE I WAS GONNA FAINT 
WHERE'S THE FINISH LINE MAN WHERE'S THE FINISH LINE 
BUT THE FINISH LINE ISN'T IN SIGHT AND RAJKO IS STILL GAINING ON HIM 
MOSTLY I WAS JUST THINKING ACTUALLY DON'T THINK TOO MUCH 
JUST PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN PADDLE HARD I WILL DEFINITELY CATCH HIM 
IN THE VILLAGE THERE'S WORD THAT A WHITE MAN IS APPROACHING THE FINISH LINE 
I CAN SEE SOMEBODY CAN YOU SEE SOME WHITE SKIN 
STILL HAVEN'T SEEN HIM YET 
WAIT A MINUTE I SEE SOMEBODY 
IT MIGHT BE RAJKO OR RICHARD 
IT'S JASON JASON JASON 
THERE YOU GO THERE YOU GO TAME THE BEAST BABY 
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE KID THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT BABY 
YEAH BUDDY YOU WIN 
YOU GOT IT YEAH BREATHE BREATHE 
IT'S SO HARD 
WAS IT A GOOD BRO 
I DID IT MAN 
THAT WAS A LONG WAY 
JASON HAS EVEN BEATEN SOME OF THE LOCALS 
MAN GOOD JOB 
I TRIED SO HARD MAN 
MINUTES LATER RAJKO BRINGS IT HOME FOLLOWED BY RICHARD AND MARK 
BRAD'S WON TWO JASON'S WON TWO RAJKO'S WON TWO 
THERE'S NOW A THREE WAY TIE FOR THE OVERALL TITLE BETWEEN JASON BRAD AND RAJKO 
SO USING LEAVES AS BALLOTS THE SIX ATHLETES HOLD A SECRET VOTE TO BREAK THE DEADLOCK 
THE DECISION IS UNANIMOUS 
JASON IS THE LAST MAN STANDING 
OH MY GOD 
IT'S A BETTER DAY TODAY MAN 
JASON'S THE PERSON WHO'S GROWN A LOT WHO'S BEEN THROUGH 
A LOT OF STRUGGLE AND STILL BEEN ABLE TO PULL IT THROUGH 
HE WAS PRETTY MUCH THERE EVERY CHALLENGE WE'VE DONE ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING 
HIS HEART WAS THERE MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE'S AND ALLOWED HIM TO EXCEL THAT MUCH FARTHER 
I ACHIEVED SOMETHING 
TRULY AND 
I DON'T GET THAT FEELING THAT OFTEN IN MY LIFE
