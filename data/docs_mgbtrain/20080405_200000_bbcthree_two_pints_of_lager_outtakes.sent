WHAT DO YOU WANT 
THEY'VE MADE AN INCREDIBLE SEVEN SERIES 
AND THE OUTTAKES ARE FUNNIER THAN EVER 
CAN I DO THAT AGAIN I FUCKED IT UP 
TWO PINTS IS FULL OF OUTTAKES YOU COULD MAKE A SHOW WITH THEM 
I'M SORRY I'VE ONLY GOT ONE LINE AND I FUCKED IT UP 
IF THINGS GO WRONG AND IT'S MY FAULT I DO PUT MY HANDS IN THE AIR 
BALLS I FORGOT MY LINE 
WHO CAN SAY THEY COME TO WORK AND HAVE A LAUGH 
AND MESS AROUND WITH MATES IT'S BRILLIANT 
YOU'VE NO RIGHT TO BE LECTURING WHEN YOU'VE HAD S. C. H. SUCH TERRIBLE 
EVEN THOUGH I'VE WRITTEN A THING THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY 
IT STILL MAKES ME LAUGH AN AWFUL LOT WHEN THEY DO MESS UP 
I'VE COME TO APPLY FOR A P. P. P BOLLOCKS 
WHEN TWO PINTS STARTED THE CAST WERE LIKE LITTLE LAMBS 
TAKING THEIR FIRST WOBBLY STEPS IN SPRING 
THEY MAY NOW BE SEASONED PROS BUT WITH THIS LOT 
MATURITY ALSO GOES HAND IN HAND WITH MORE MIDDLE AGED MOMENTS 
HELLO 
OH NO I'M AFRAID YOU'VE COME THROUGH TO DON'T KNOW 
SORRY 
WRONG NUMBER GOODBYE 
AS YOU GET OLDER IT GETS HARDER TO REMEMBER LINES' 
I HAVE TO STUDY 'EM NOW 
REALLY GET A SET OF BINS ON READING GLASSES 
IT MAKES ME FEEL A BIT SCARED MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M GETTING OLD 
IT'S LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING 
COULD YOU TELL

I THINK AS WE'VE GOT OLDER IT'S GOT MORE 
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT I'M SAYING DEAR 
FUCK IS THAT ME

THEY'RE COMPLETELY MADE UP WORDS 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING

IT GOES OUT YOUR HEAD 
IT'S THERE ONE MINUTE THEN SOMEONE'S TOOK IT AWAY 
GONNA GET FIRED 
SHEEP B. A. A. QUICK GAZ 
DO SOMETHING THEY'RE BECOMING FERAL 
TWO PINTS HAS A REPUTATION FOR BAD LANGUAGE 
SO YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED TO HEAR THERE'S ONLY ONE F. WORD PER SERIES 
FUCK THE SHEEP 
IF ONLY THE SAME COULD BE SAID ABOUT THE OUTTAKES 
I LOVE HIM I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT HIM 
I GET THESE BUTTERFLIES FOR HIM 
SEE HE REALLY LIKES THEM 
PLUS JANET SORT OF MISSES HIM TOO 
IN TWO PINTS WE'RE ONLY ALLOWED ONE F. WORD 
IT COMES I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M BEING POLITE SAYING F. WORD 
BUT IT'S THE LAST EPISODE OF EVERY SERIES ONE OF US GETS TO SAY IT 
JONNY IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
WHO THE FUCK ARE MO MO AND PIXIE 
BUT THEN IN THE ACTUAL OUTTAKES THERE'S F.'S FLYING EVERYWHERE 
THAT RING IS A SYMBOL OF JONNY'S UNDYING LOVE FOR ME 
I'M GONNA RAISE THAT MONEY TO PROVE A A A FUCK OFF 
I THINK THAT'S WHY WHENEVER I MESS UP THE F.'S FLY 
COS I HAVEN'T HAD MINE FOR YEARS SO I USE THEM IN MY OUTTAKES 
IF YOU'RE BEING GENUINE I'M SORRY IT'S FUCK IT 
SHERIDAN'S USUALLY VERY PROFESSIONAL 
OCCASIONALLY SHE'LL SAY OH F. WORD 
WILL YOU BE A SHOP OWNER RIGHT AND I'LL BE A DISGRUNTLED WIDOW 
SHOP KEEPER NO FUCK OFF NOT A SHOP KEEPER 
FUCK IT 
THE THING THAT'D MAKE SHERIDAN MESS UP 
WOULD BE ANY SORT OF CONVOLUTED SENTENCE 
WHICH IS WHY I WRITE THEM IN A LOT 
LOOK DAD ALL I MEANT TO SAY IS THAT I DO UNDERSTAND 
DO YOU 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIDE THIS AS IF AS IF F. F. F. F. 
WILL AND RALF SAY THAT WHEN I GET NERVOUS 
AND I'M COMING UP TO A BIG WORD MY MOUTH GOES SLIGHTLY TO THE SIDE 
DONNA I'M SO TOUCHED 
AND THIS'LL 
BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE ACTOR'S FAULT WHEN THINGS GO WRONG 
SOMETIMES A PROBLEMATIC PROP STANDS BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR BAFTA

IN REHEARSALS I DID A DIFFERENT NOISE AND THEN 
I WAS DOING IT TO MYSELF IN THE MIRROR AND I THOUGHT

WHEN SHE ORGASMS SHE MAKES A NOISE LIKE THIS 
PREVIOUSLY IN THE WEEK HE'D DONE NOISES LIKE AAAAAAH AND STUFF

TWO PINTS IS RECORDED IN FRONT OF A STUDIO AUDIENCE 
WHICH MEANS THERE'S NO CANNED LAUGHTER ROUND HERE 
AND THEY ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

WHEN THEY GO WRONG THEY NORMALLY SWEAR

JANGLE JANGLE 
IF YOU GET SOMEBODY THAT HAS A FUNNY LAUGH
