WELCOME TO THE KEY STAGE THREE BITESIZE REVISION SERIES 
IF YOU'RE REVISING FOR YOUR ENGLISH TESTS AND NEED HELP 
WITH THE LITERARY ELEMENTS THIS IS THE PROGRAMME FOR YOU 
IT'S DIVIDED INTO THREE SECTIONS TO COVER MOST OF THE AREAS YOU'LL NEED 
FOR YOUR TESTS 
AND YOU CAN PLAY IT BACK AT YOUR OWN PACE IN BITE SIZED CHUNKS 
THERE ARE THREE TEST PAPERS 
FOR ENGLISH AND IN ONE OF THEM YOU'LL GET QUESTIONS ON READING 
ACROSS A RANGE OF TEXTS TO INCLUDE LITERARY AND NON LITERARY WRITING 
ONE OF THE PASSAGES YOU WILL BE ANSWERING QUESTIONS ON 
MAY BE FROM A SHORT STORY OR A NOVEL OR POSSIBLY A POEM 
AND EITHER THE LONGER OR SHORTER WRITING TASK 
COULD GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE YOUR OWN NARRATIVE TEXT 
THE SHAKESPEARE PAPER WILL BE ALL ABOUT THE TWO SECTIONS 
FROM A SHAKESPEARE PLAY WHICH YOU'LL HAVE BEEN STUDYING IN CLASS 
NOW WE'VE CHOSEN MACBETH BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU 
ARE DOING A DIFFERENT PLAY 
WE'LL GIVE YOU A STRUCTURE WHICH WILL HELP YOU ANSWER QUESTIONS ON 
WHATEVER PLAY YOU'RE STUDYING 
THIS PROGRAMME IS ALL ABOUT MAKING CHOICES 
WHEN YOU READ YOU'LL BE THINKING ABOUT THE CHOICES ANOTHER PERSON 
THE AUTHOR HAS MADE 
WHY MIGHT THE AUTHOR HAVE CHOSEN TO USE THOSE WORDS OR THOSE SENTENCES 
AND THE PEOPLE WHO MARK YOUR TEST THE EXAMINERS WILL BE LOOKING TO 
SEE WHETHER YOU'VE MADE YOUR OWN CHOICES OF LANGUAGE WHEN YOU WRITE 
YOU CAN EITHER WORK YOUR WAY THROUGH THE PROGRAMME IN ORDER 
OR FAST FORWARD TO VIEW THE SECTION YOU NEED THE MOST HELP WITH 
AND WHEN YOU SEE THIS IT GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
PAUSE AND HAVE A THINK MAKE NOTES AND TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS 
HERE ARE SOME TIPS TO HELP YOU MAKE A START ON YOUR REVISION 
CREATE A REVISION SPACE 
SOMEWHERE QUIET AND COMFORTABLE 
LET EVERYONE KNOW YOU'D PREFER NOT TO BE DISTURBED 
DRAW UP A REALISTIC REVISION PROGRAMME ONE THAT YOU'LL STICK TO 
OTHERWISE YOU'LL GIVE UP BEFORE YOU'VE STARTED 
WORK IN SHORT BURSTS 
EVERY THIRTY MINUTES OR SO CHANGE TOPIC OR SUBJECT 
BE ACTIVE WHEN REVISING 
DON'T JUST LOOK AT THE WORDS ON THE PAGE ANNOTATE HIGHLIGHT 
WRITE NOTES DRAW PICTURES OR MAKE CONCEPT MAPS OR FLOW CHARTS 
VARY HOW YOU REVISE TRY WORKING WITH A PARTNER OR SMALL GROUP TO 
TEST AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER 
TAKE REGULAR BREAKS AND GIVE YOURSELF A REWARD 
BUT MAKE SURE YOU GET BACK TO YOUR REVISION AFTERWARDS 
IN THIS UNIT ON NARRATIVES 
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT A SHORT STORY TO SHOW YOU HOW TO APPROACH 
QUESTIONS THAT ASK YOU TO READ BETWEEN THE LINES 
YOU MAY KNOW THIS AS USING THE SKILLS OF INFERENCE AND DEDUCTION 
THIS MEANS THAT WE LOOK UNDER THE SURFACE AT SUGGESTED MEANING 
LET'S SEE HOW THIS WORKS WITH CHARACTER 
WE'LL BE USING A DRAMATISATION OF TUNNEL VISION A SHORT STORY 
WRITTEN BY ALAN GIBBONS 
BEFORE WE START LET'S FIND OUT FROM THE AUTHOR WHERE THE IDEAS 
FOR HIS CHARACTERS CAME FROM 
THE CHARACTERS IN THE STORY ARE BASED ON PEOPLE I KNOW 
ONE OF THEM IS ME I'M THE CAUTIOUS NARRATOR BECAUSE 
ALL MY FRIENDSHIPS HAVE BEEN BUILT ON MY MATES ALL WANTING TO GET IN 
THESE DESPERATE SCRAPES AND I WAS ALL GOING DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD 
I WAS ALWAYS 
THE THOUGHTFUL ONE BEING DRAGGED ALONG 
BUT I ALWAYS WENT ALONG AND DID THE ADVENTURES BUT I WAS THE ONE 
WHO THOUGHT ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS AND THE ONE WHO TOLD THE STORIES LATER 
SO IT FOLLOWED THE PATTERN OF FRIENDSHIP IN MY CHILDHOOD 
NOW LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY 
WHICH PUTS IT IN CONTEXT AND INTRODUCES THE CHARACTERS 
IT WAS THE WEIRDEST THING 
I LOOKED INTO THE DARKNESS AND I FELT IT LOOKING RIGHT BACK AT ME 
THAT'S RIGHT 
IT WAS ALIVE 
SOME PEOPLE THINK DARKNESS IS JUST A PLACE WHERE THERE'S NO LIGHT 
BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN DOWN TRANTER LOUDEN'S KITCHEN 
THE DARKNESS THERE IS RICH AND PATTERNED LIKE A QUILT 
THE DEEPER YOU GO INTO IT THE MORE YOU SEE 
THERE ARE FACES THERE TWISTED LIMBS PRESENCES 
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND UNLESS YOU'D BEEN INSIDE THAT DARKNESS 
AND I HAVE 
FOR A WHILE I THOUGHT IT HAD ME 
THE WHOLE THING STARTED ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS THIRTEEN 
SOME WORKMEN WERE DIGGING A WATER MAIN 
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO FOUND A WAY INTO TRANTER LOUDEN'S KITCHEN AS 
IT'S KNOWN LOCALLY A VAST NETWORK 
OF SANDSTONE TUNNELS AND CAVERNS BELOW THE STREETS 
LOUDEN WAS A PREACHER HERE IN OAKFIELD BACK IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
IT SEEMS HE LIVED DOWN THERE 
HE WAS A LONER BY ALL ACCOUNTS 
THE DARKNESS BENEATH THE TOWN SUITED HIM 
THEN THE KIDS STARTED TO DISAPPEAR 
IN JUST A FEW WEEKS HALF A DOZEN BOYS AND GIRLS VANISHED 
IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE EVERYBODY SAID TRANTER LOUDEN 
HAD THEM DOWN IN HIS KITCHEN AND WAS BOILING THEM UP FOR SUPPER 
LOAD OF NONSENSE OF COURSE 
BUT THE TOWNSFOLK KICKED UP A STINK AND RAN TRANTER LOUDEN OUT OF TOWN 
THOUGH SOME SAY HE JUST WENT BACK UNDERGROUND 
KIDS HAVE BEEN DISAPPEARING EVER SINCE 
NOT OFTEN BUT OFTEN ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU WONDER 
IT'S ALL PART OF THE TRANTER LOUDEN LEGEND 
ONCE THOSE WORKMEN UNEARTHED TRANTER LOUDEN'S STRANGE WORLD 
ALL SORTS OF RUMOURS STARTED ABOUT GOLD RINGS AND COINS 
IT WAS THE IDEA OF HIDDEN TREASURE 
THAT GRABBED MY MATE CRAIG'S ATTENTION 
ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS FIND THE RIGHT TUNNEL AND WE'D BE RICH 
BEYOND OUR WILDEST DREAMS 
SO ONE SUMMER HOLIDAY WE BOOKED OURSELVES A GUIDED TOUR 
ON THE DAY WE WERE THE ONLY ONES AT THE TUNNEL OPENING 
THE GUIDE AN OLD BOY WITH A LIMP 
DIDN'T LOOK TOO PLEASED AT HAVING TO OPEN UP FOR A COUPLE OF KIDS 
BUT HE TOOK US ANYWAY 
WHAT HAVE YOU NOTICED SO FAR ABOUT THE STORYTELLER 
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE HIM TO SOMEBODY ELSE 
WOULD YOU MENTION THE FACT THAT THIS MEMORY HAS HAD A BIG IMPACT ON HIM 
HOW DO WE KNOW THIS 
IS IT HIS APPEARANCE 
OR MAYBE HIS REACTION TO CRAIG'S IDEA OF GOING INTO THE TUNNELS 
YOU'RE LEARNING ABOUT THE CHARACTER ALL THE TIME AND PICKING UP IDEAS 
IN MANY CASES THE CHARACTER'S THOUGHTS 
ACTIONS AND WORDS ARE THE KEY TO THE WHOLE MEANING OF THE PIECE 
WHEN I AM TAKING A LOOK AT HOW I CAN UNFOLD AND DEVELOP A CHARACTER 
I THINK THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY RATHER THAN LECTURING TO THE READER 
IS TO PUT THEM INTO A SITUATION OF PRESSURE OF CRISIS AND SEEING HOW 
THEY REACT WHAT WILL THEY SAY WHAT WILL THEY DO HOW WILL THEY 
EXPOSE THEIR INNER SELF WHEN THEY'RE DESPERATE TO ESCAPE A SITUATION 
IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN DESCRIBING WHAT COLOUR EYES 
THEY HAVE AND ALL THESE THINGS 
YOU ACTUALLY SEE HOW HE WORKS OR HOW SHE OPERATES IN A SITUATION 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT HOW THE STORY DEVELOPS 
WATCH THIS NEXT CLIP CAREFULLY AND CONCENTRATE ON WHAT WE FIND OUT 
ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CRAIG AND THE STORYTELLER 
THE MOMENT I GOT DOWN THERE IN THAT STARING DARKNESS I WANTED OUT 
I DON'T THINK THIS IS SUCH A GOOD IDEA DON'T BE SUCH A WIMP 
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF TRANTER LOUDEN AND HIS COOKING POT 
MY STOMACH FILLED WITH A DULL ACHE FEAR WAS CHEWING UP MY INSIDES 
WE WERE ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES INTO THE TOUR WHEN CRAIG DID IT 
ALL OF A SUDDEN HE GRABBED MY ARM AND DRAGGED ME DOWN ONE OF THE TUNNELS 
IT HAD A BIG SIGN THAT SAID DANGER KEEP OUT 
HEY HEY 
IT DIDN'T TAKE US LONG TO LOSE HIM 
WITH THAT LEG OF HIS HE WAS NEVER GOING TO CATCH US 
CRAIG PULLED OUT A FLASHLIGHT FROM HIS RUCKSACK 
READY TO FIND SOME TREASURE 
CRAIG I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD JUST GO BACK 
BUT HE WOULDN'T HAVE IT 
HE WAS DETERMINED TO PRESS FORWARD 
AS WE PENETRATED DEEPER INTO THE BLACKNESS I STARTED TO 
SEE DIFFERENCES IN THE GLOOM 
IT WAS AS IF THERE WERE DIFFERENT PLANES OF DARKNESS ALL SHIFTING AND 
SLIDING INTO EACH OTHER 
SO ON WE WENT 
UNTIL WE CAME ACROSS SOMETHING THAT WASN'T PART OF ANY TOUR 
UP AHEAD THERE WAS A LINE OF CANDLES 
WHO COULD HAVE DONE THAT CRAIG THIS ISN'T RIGHT 
LET'S GO BACK 
BUT CRAIG WAS HAVING NONE OF IT 
I SEE SOMETHING 
HE THREW DOWN HIS TORCH 
HE PICKED UP ONE OF THE CANDLES TO GUIDE HIS WAY 
I'VE FOUND IT THERE GLITTERING IN THE HALF LIT GLOOM WERE RINGS 
COINS ALTAR PIECES GOBLETS ALL MADE OF GOLD SO IT SEEMED TO ME 
AS YOU BEGIN TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND ABOUT A PARTICULAR CHARACTER YOU 
NEED TO LOOK AT THE WAY A CHARACTER 
TALKS AND BEHAVES AND HOW HE OR SHE RELATES TO OTHER CHARACTERS 
FROM ALL THESE THINGS YOU CAN BEGIN TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS 
IT'S LIKE UNWRAPPING LAYERS OF A PERSON'S PERSONALITY 
HOW DO WE KNOW THIS 
WHY DON'T YOU PAUSE HERE REWIND THE PROGRAMME AND WATCH THAT CLIP AGAIN 
THIS TIME CONCENTRATE ON 
FINDING THE EVIDENCE THAT SUGGESTS THESE THINGS ABOUT THE STORYTELLER 
HOW DID YOU GET ON 
DID YOU GET SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
AT NO POINT DOES THE AUTHOR TELL US 
THE STORYTELLER IS SCARED AND EASILY LED 
HE SHOWS US THE CHARACTER THROUGH 
THE WORDS HE SPEAKS AND THE WAY HE ACTS 
THIS IS READING BETWEEN THE LINES 
YOU FOUND KEY POINTS WHICH HELPED YOU TO FORM AN OPINION AND THESE 
WERE BACKED UP IN THE NARRATIVE 
AND OF COURSE NOT EVERYBODY WILL HAVE THE SAME OPINION 
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A QUESTION 
AND GO BACK OVER A COUPLE OF EXTRACTS FROM THE STORY IN DETAIL 
YOU'LL NEED A PEN AND PAPER READY TO JOT DOWN YOUR THOUGHTS 
TO TACKLE THIS QUESTION WATCH THE CLIP AGAIN AND NOTE 
DOWN DETAILS FROM THE NARRATIVE YOU COULD USE TO SUPPORT YOUR ANSWER 
YOU MIGHT BEGIN WITH TWO COLUMNS LIKE THIS 
AS YOU WRITE DOWN YOUR POINTS 
HIGHLIGHT THE KEY WORDS AND USEFUL PHRASES 
BEFORE YOU MAKE A START PAUSE HERE REWIND AND WATCH THE CLIP AGAIN 
SO HOW DID YOU DO 
LET'S START WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE STORYTELLER 
ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS FIND THE RIGHT TUNNEL AND WE'D 
BE RICH BEYOND OUR WILDEST DREAMS 
THE MOMENT I GOT DOWN THERE IN THAT STARING DARKNESS I WANTED OUT 
I DON'T THINK THIS IS SUCH A GOOD IDEA 
DON'T BE SUCH A WIMP 
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF TRANTER LOUDEN AND HIS COOKING POT 
NOW LET'S FOCUS ON WHAT WE LEARN ABOUT CRAIG 
CRAIG I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD JUST GO BACK 
BUT HE WOULDN'T HAVE IT 
HE WAS DETERMINED TO PRESS FORWARD 
EVEN THOUGH HIS FRIEND IS TERRIFIED 
AT THE RIGHT MOMENT HE GRABS HIS FRIEND SO 
THAT THEY CAN ESCAPE FROM THE GUIDE 
WE WERE ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES INTO THE TOUR WHEN CRAIG DID IT 
ALL OF A SUDDEN HE GRABBED MY ARM AND DRAGGED ME DOWN ONE OF THE TUNNELS 
IT HAD A BIG SIGN THAT SAID DANGER KEEP OUT 
CRAIG HAS NO CONCERN FOR HIS OWN SAFETY OR THAT OF HIS FRIEND 
AS HE IS SO DRIVEN BY THE THOUGHT OF FINDING TREASURE 
SO TO SUMMARISE THESE ARE THE POINTS YOU 
COULD MAKE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CRAIGAND THE STORYTELLER 
TO GAIN THE HIGHER MARKS IN THE FIVE MARK QUESTIONS 
YOU MUST BACK UP WHAT YOU SAY BY REFERRING TO THE TEXT AND TO THE 
WRITER'S CHOICE OF LANGUAGE 
YOUR QUOTATIONS MUST BE CONCISE APPROPRIATE AND TO THE POINT 
SOMETIMES IT IS ENOUGH TO JUST USE ONE OR TWO WORDS 
OR A SHORT PHRASE FOR EXAMPLE 
THIS PROVES TO THE EXAMINER THAT YOU 
KNOW HOW THE LANGUAGE OF THE PASSAGE WORKS 
WHEN YOU'RE USING QUOTATIONS TRY TO FIND A SINGLE SENTENCE OR PHRASE 
THE ONE WHICH ILLUSTRATES YOUR POINT MOST CLEARLY 
THEN TO SHOW YOU'RE USING A QUOTATION USE QUOTATION MARKS 
IF YOU ARE USING A COMPLETE SENTENCE PUT IT ON A SEPARATE LINE 
IF YOU ARE USING SINGLE WORDS OR SHORT PHRASES 
EMBED THEM WITHIN YOUR OWN SENTENCE 
THIS IS AN EXCELLENT WAY OF USING QUOTATIONS 
BUT IT DOES NEED PRACTICE 
SOMETHING ELSE YOU'LL DEFINITELY BE ASKED ABOUT 
IS THE AUTHOR'S USE OF LANGUAGE 
WE COVERED SOME OF THIS WHEN WE EXPLORED CHARACTERISATION 
YOU MIGHT BE ASKED 
IT'S OFTEN HARD TO KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN 
PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU'RE UNDER PRESSURE 
HOW DO YOU COMMENT ON AN AUTHOR'S USE OF LANGUAGE 
LET'S LOOK AT ANOTHER SECTION FROM TUNNEL VISION 
WHERE THE LANGUAGE IS VERY DISTINCTIVE 
AS YOU WATCH THINK ABOUT OR JOT DOWN 
YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF HOW THE LANGUAGE IS USED 
WE'RE RICH HE HANDED ME SOME OF THE STUFF AND STARTED SHOVING THE 
REST INTO HIS RUCKSACK 
THEN THE CANDLES BLEW OUT 
HOW I DON'T KNOW THERE WASN'T A BREATH OF WIND IN THAT DANK TUNNEL 
THAT'S WHEN THE DARKNESS GREW FINGERS AND NAILS 
THAT'S WHEN IT STARTED SCRATCHING MY ARMS AND LEGS 
I HEARD CRAIG DESPERATELY TRYING TO FIND THE TORCH BUT ITS LIGHT WAS OUT 
JUST LIKE THE CANDLES CRAIG WAS SOBBING 
I FELT SOMETHING CLAWING AT MY CLOTHES IT WASN'T CRAIG 
HE WAS STILL SCRABBLING FOR THE TORCH WRESTLING WITH HIS FEAR 
THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT THERE BESIDE ME 
A CREATURE OF THE INTENSE GLOOM 
THAT'S WHEN THE DARKNESS ROARED 
THE WAY ALAN GIBBONS USES THE LANGUAGE TO BUILD UP TENSION 
IS VERY DISTINCTIVE 
LET'S BEGIN BY LOOKING AT SENTENCE STRUCTURE 
AND THEN MOVE ON TO VOCABULARY 
THERE'S A VARIETY OF MAINLY 
COMPOUND SENTENCES INTERWOVEN WITH SHORT SIMPLE SENTENCES 
THIS IS A WELL KNOWN WAY OF BUILDING TENSION 
BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE SENTENCES ARE VERY SHORT 
YOU CAN ALMOST IMAGINE THE STORYTELLER 
PANTING WITH FEAR AND ONLY ABLE TO SPEAK IN SHORT SENTENCES 
SO WE HAVE 
THESE KEEP THE PACE GOING IT MOVES VERY QUICKLY 
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE VOCABULARY THE WORDS 
WHY DID THE AUTHOR MAKE THOSE CHOICES 
THE VOCABULARY I'VE USED IN THE STORY 
THERE'S A KIND OF RECEIVED NOTION THAT YOU MUST USE VARIED VOCABULARY 
NOW I DON'T DO THAT INSTEAD I WANTED TO FARM IMAGES OF 
DARKNESS REALLY INTENSIVELY SO DARKNESS GLOOM MURK AND 
PILED UP IMAGES BUT USING LANGUAGE TO KIND OF CONDENSE ALL THESE IMAGES 
OF DARKNESS INTO ONE OVERWHELMING FEELING OF DARKNESS AND THREAT 
SO THAT WAS HOW I APPROACHED THAT 
IN TERMS OF PUNCTUATION IT'S VERY SIMPLE 
MOST OF IT IS DEMARCATED WITH FULL STOPS AND VERY OCCASIONALLY 
QUESTION MARKS AND EXCLAMATION MARKS ASKING 
THE READER WHAT'S ROUND THAT CORNER WHAT'S COMING NEXT AND THEN KA BAM 
THE DRAMA 
IN THIS SECTION THE VERBS ARE VERY ACTIVE AND STRONG 
THE WORDS PAINT A VERY VISUAL PICTURE 
AND ALSO APPEAL TO OUR HEARING 
THERE'S THE USE OF REPETITION 
THESE BUILD EMPHASIS AT THE FRONT OF THE SENTENCE 
KEEPING US FOCUSED ON THE ACTION 
ADD THE MYSTERY ABOUT WHAT THE CREATURE IS 
AND YOU HAVE VERY SUCCESSFULLY CREATED TENSION 
BUT ALAN GIBBONS IS VERY CLEVER 
HE DOESN'T STOP THERE 
WATCH THE NEXT CLIP TO THE END AND SEE IF YOU CAN PINPOINT HOW 
HE CONTINUES TO BUILD THE TENSION 
BEFORE IT DROPS AWAY TOWARDS THE RESOLUTION 
CRAIG THE TREASURE GIVE IT BACK NEVER FINDERS KEEPERS 
THEN THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE 
A SECOND VOICE ECHOING AND CHATTERING IN THE BLACKNESS 
SAYING A PRAYER MAYBE OR A CURSE IT WAS TOO LOW 
TOO DULLED IN THE VELVET DARK FOR ME TO MAKE OUT THE WORDS 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE SCAMPER OF A RAT EXCEPT THAT IT WAS IN SOME WAY 
SOME FOUL COLD WAY HUMAN 
THIS ISN'T OURS IT BELONGS TO TRANTER LOUDEN 
SO I LET MY SHARE VANISH INTO THE SWARMING DARKNESS 
IMMEDIATELY THE TEARING SUCKING PRESENCE FELL AWAY FROM ME 
I COULD GO 
NOT CRAIG HE CLUNG TO THE DARK AND IT CLUNG TO HIM 
THEN I HEARD SOMETHING 
A BUTCHER SOUND IN THE GLOOM 
LIKE THE CRUNCH OF BONES THE CRACK OF CARTILAGE THE SPLASH OF BLOOD 
I SHOUTED CRAIG'S NAME CRAIG CRAIG 
BUT ALL I COULD HEAR WAS THE REVERBERATING CRUNCH CRACK SPLASH 
AND THEN SOMETHING BUBBLING IN THE KITCHEN 
I RAN FOR MY LIFE FIGHTING MY WAY OUT OF THE RAGING 
SCUTTERING BLACKNESS MORE ALONE MORE SCARED THAN I'VE EVER BEEN 
THERE HE IS 
THE RESCUE TEAM DISCOVERED ME A FEW HOURS LATER HALF DEAD WITH FRIGHT 
CRAIG'S NEVER BEEN FOUND 
TO THIS DAY WHEN I'M LYING IN BED I HEAR A BUBBLING SOUND IN THE NIGHT 
I'VE GOT A FEELING I KNOW WHAT'S COOKING IN THE KITCHEN 
WHAT DID YOU NOTICE ABOUT THE TENSION IN THAT SECTION 
THE SENTENCES FOLLOW VERY SIMILAR PATTERNS 
THEN I HEARD SOMETHING 
A BUTCHER SOUND IN THE GLOOM 
LIKE THE CRUNCH OF BONES THE CRACK OF CARTILAGE THE SPLASH OF BLOOD 
I SHOUTED CRAIG'S NAME CRAIG CRAIG 
BUT ALL I COULD HEAR WAS THE REVERBERATING CRUNCH CRACK SPLASH 
AND THEN SOMETHING BUBBLING IN THE KITCHEN 
I RAN FOR MY LIFE FIGHTING MY WAY OUT OF THE RAGING 
SCUTTERING BLACKNESS MORE ALONE MORE SCARED THAN I'VE EVER BEEN 
THESE SENTENCES ARE MUCH LONGER 
AND CONTRAST WITH THE SIMPLE SENTENCES WHICH HAVE GONE BEFORE 
THEY ALMOST READ AS LISTS 
THE AUTHOR BUILDS UP THE ACTION AS HE RELENTLESSLY 
PILES ONE IMAGE ON TOP OF THE OTHER 
NOW LET'S LOOK AT HOW A VERY FAMOUS 
AUTHOR FROM VICTORIAN TIMES USES LANGUAGE TO GREAT EFFECT 
THIS NEXT CLIP IS FROM THE START OF A NOVEL CALLED 
BLEAK HOUSE BY CHARLES DICKENS 
IT'S SET IN LONDON ON A DAY WHEN THE CITY 
IS UNDER A BLANKET OF GRIMY FOG 
AS YOU WATCH THINK ABOUT OR JOT DOWN 
YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THE WAY LANGUAGE IS USED 
FOG EVERYWHERE 
FOG UP THE RIVER WHERE IT FLOWS AMONG GREEN AITS AND MEADOWS 
FOG DOWN THE RIVER WHERE IT ROLLS DEFILED AMONG THE TIERS OF SHIPPING 
AND THE WATERSIDE POLLUTIONS OF A GREAT AND DIRTY CITY 
FOG ON THE ESSEX MARSHES FOG ON THE KENTISH HEIGHTS 
FOG CREEPING INTO THE CABOOSES OF COLLIER BRIGS FOG LYING OUT 
ON THE YARDS AND HOVERING IN THE RIGGING OF GREAT SHIPS 
FOG DROOPING IN THE GUNWALES OF BARGES AND SMALL BOATS 
FOG IN THE EYES AND THROATS OF ANCIENT GREENWICH PENSIONERS 
WHEEZING BY THE FIRESIDES OF THEIR WARDS 
FOG IN THE STEM AND BOWL OF THE AFTERNOON PIPE OF THE WRATHFUL 
SKIPPER DOWN IN HIS CLOSE CABIN 
FOG CRUELLY PINCHING THE TOES 
AND FINGERS OF HIS SHIVERING LITTLE PRENTICE BOY ON DECK 
CHANCE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGES PEEPING OVER THE PARAPETS INTO A NETHER SKY 
OF FOG WITH FOG ALL ROUND THEM AS IF THEY WERE UP IN A BALLOON 
AND HANGING IN THE MISTY CLOUDS 
I'M SURE YOU'LL HAVE NOTICED ONE OR TWO THINGS ABOUT THE LANGUAGE 
USED IN THAT PASSAGE ALREADY 
IT'S VERY DISTINCTIVE 
THERE'S A LOT OF REPETITION ISN'T THERE 
THE WORD FOG BEING USED SEVERAL TIMES IN EACH SENTENCE 
IT'S QUITE A LONG PASSAGE SO TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT HOW THE 
LANGUAGE IS USED LET'S CONCENTRATE ON A SHORTER SECTION 
AS YOU HEAR THE PASSAGE AGAIN MAKE SOME NOTES ABOUT THE AUTHOR'S 
CHOICE OF WORDS AND SENTENCES 
TO FOCUS YOUR THOUGHTS 
IMAGINE YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN THIS QUESTION IN THE TEST 
WITH THIS QUESTION THINK PARTICULARLY ABOUT 
THE CHOICE OF WORDS AND THE USE OF SENTENCES AND PAUSES WITHIN THEM 
IT WILL HELP IF YOU SPLIT YOUR NOTES INTO TWO SECTIONS 
THINK ABOUT THE EFFECTS THAT DICKENS USES TO CONVEY HIS MEANING 
SO WHAT DID YOU NOTE DOWN IN YOUR TWO SECTIONS 
FIRSTLY IN THE WORDS SECTION YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTED 
THE REPETITION OF THE WORD FOG 
AND THE WAY IT BEGINS NEW CLAUSES OR SECTIONS OF THE LONG SENTENCES 
LOOK AT THE GROUP OF WORDS ABOUT THE DIRT OF LONDON 
DEFILED POLLUTIONS DIRTY 
THE EFFECT OF THIS GROUP OF WORDS IS THAT WE GET A STRONG 
IMPRESSION OF THE DIRT AND GRIME 
OR PERHAPS THE WAY DICKENS WRITES ABOUT THE MOVEMENTS OF THE FOG 
THE VERBS AND ADVERBS HE USES 
CREEPING LYING HOVERING CRUELLY 
WHEN DICKENS PERSONIFIES FOG LIKE THIS WE BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT IT AS 
AN EVIL MALICIOUS PERSON 
IT SEEMS TO HAVE A STRENGTH OF ITS OWN DELIBERATELY PLANNING 
MISERY FOR LONDONERS 
DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING ABOUT THE SENTENCE STRUCTURE 
THERE ARE A WIDE VARIETY OF SENTENCE TYPES 
AND IF WE HIGHLIGHT THEM FOR YOU IT'S EASY TO SEE 
THE PARAGRAPH BEGINS WITH A VERY SIMPLE BLUNT STATEMENT 
SO BLUNT IT DOESN'T EVEN CONTAIN A VERB 
FOG EVERYWHERE 
THIS GIVES US A QUICK COMPLETE LOOK AT LONDON 
ALL YOU CAN SEE IS FOG AND THERE'S NO POINT TRYING TO ESCAPE 
LATER DICKENS USES SHORT STATEMENTS AGAIN BUT THIS TIME TWO IN THE SAME 
SENTENCE BALANCING THEM 
FOG ON THE ESSEX MARSHES FOG ON THE KENTISH HEIGHTS 
IT TAKES THE IDEA FURTHER LOOKING DOWN TO THE MARSHES 
AND UP TO THE HILLS THIS TIME WE'RE LOOKING AT ACTUAL PLACES 
AND THERE'S STILL NO ESCAPE 
THEN TOWARDS THE END OF THE PASSAGE 
WE READ TWO LONG SENTENCES SPLIT UP INTO SECTIONS WITH HEAVY PAUSES 
THESE TAKE US INTO MUCH GREATER DETAIL INTO SHIP'S CABINS 
UP INTO THE RIGGING EVEN INTO THE EYES AND THROATS OF OLD PEOPLE 
THE SENTENCES LIKE THE FOG DRIFT EVERYWHERE 
NOW HAVE A GO AT ANSWERING THIS QUESTION 
USE THESE BULLET POINTS TO STRUCTURE YOUR ANSWER 
MAKE SURE YOU WRITE SOMETHING ABOUT EACH BULLET POINT 
AND DON'T FORGET TO USE QUOTATIONS 
YOU MIGHT FIND A POEM WHEN YOU OPEN THE READING PAPER 
IT'S EASY TO BE THROWN BY POETRY 
IT CAN SEEM SO COMPLICATED 
BUT IS IT REALLY ANY DIFFERENT FROM READING NARRATIVES 
WE USE THE SAME READING SKILLS 
WE LOOK AT IMAGERY VOCABULARY LINE LENGTH 
SO IT ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT 
THE EXAMINER WILL STILL WANT TO KNOW ABOUT HOW THE WRITER HAS 
USED LANGUAGE AND YOUR IDEAS ABOUT THE EFFECT THEY HAVE ON THE READER 
POETRY IS ONLY DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE ARE USUALLY FEWER WORDS 
SO THE MEANING TENDS TO MORE COMPRESSED AND FOCUSED 
EVERY SINGLE WORD IN A POEM HAS TO WORK HARD 
THE WORDS WORK TOGETHER IN A MORE INTENSE WAY 
AS POETRY GENERALLY DOESN'T EXPLAIN 
IT MAKES AN IMPRESSION 
IT'S ABOUT IDEAS AND FEELINGS 
AND THAT MEANS PEOPLE RESPOND TO IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS 
TYGER TYGER 
BURNING BRIGHT IN THE FORESTS OF THE NIGHT 
WHAT IMMORTAL HAND OR EYE 
DARE FRAME THY FEARFUL SYMMETRY 
WILLIAM BLAKE WROTE THE TYGER IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY FOUR AND EVER SINCE THEN 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INTERPRETING IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS 
I LOVE THE POEM TYGER TYGER 
COS I THINK IT'S GOT LOTS OF LAYERS TO IT 
IT'S VERY 
IT'S VERY MYSTERIOUS AND VERY 
LIKE IT'S GOT A STRONG BEAT ALMOST OF THE JUNGLE AND OF 
IT'S QUITE AWESOME 
AND IT ALSO HAS A RELIGIOUS UNDERTONE AS WELL LIKE 
LIKE A PRAYER OR A HYMN OR A SPELL 
I THINK TYGER TYGER IS A VERY GOOD DESCRIPTION OF A JUNGLE CAT 
IT'S VERY GOOD IT TELLS YOU ABOUT THE MUSCLE IN THE HEART 
HOW STRONGLY IT BEATS 
IT'S ABOUT 
SOMEONE TALKING ABOUT A TIGER AND SAYING THAT HOW COULD SOMEONE 
WHO MADE A NICE FLUFFY LAMB 
COULD MAKE SOMETHING AS DANGEROUS AND VIOLENT AND AGGRESSIVE AS A TIGER 
I DON'T THINK THE POEM TYGER TYGER IS ABOUT A REAL TIGER 
I SAW IT AS A REAL TIGER 
JUST SOMEBODY ASKING WHAT THING WHAT GOD COULD MAKE 
SOMETHING SO PERFECT AND SO BEAUTIFUL AS THIS TIGER 
THE TIGER I THINK IS SOME KIND OF METAPHOR FOR THE WHOLE 
OF NATURE THE ENORMITY OF NATURE THE BEAUTY OF IT THE POWER OF IT 
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING MORE TO DO WITH RELIGION AS IT'S 
ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT THE SKIES AND HEAVEN AND THE FURNACES AND STARS 
AND THE WAY IT TALKS ABOUT HE MAYBE HE'S GOD 
HOW CAN THE SAME SET OF WORDS MEAN SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS TO SO MANY 
DIFFERENT PEOPLE AH 
BLAKE LIKE ALL POETS AWARE OF THE WAY IN WHICH WORDS CAN HAVE 
A POWERFUL EFFECT ON THE PERSON WHO READS THEM 
IN THE TYGER HE USED IMAGERY 
RHYTHM AND RHYME TO CREATE IDEAS AND EMOTIONS IN THE MINDS OF THE READER 
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT RHYME RHYTHM AND IMAGERY IN DETAIL 
IT'S USEFUL TO LOOK AT RHYME AND RHYTHM TOGETHER 
WHEN YOU READ A POEM ALOUD YOU GET A SENSE OF ITS RHYTHM 
TYGER TYGER BURNING BRIGHT IN THE FORESTS OF THE NIGHT 
WHAT IMMORTAL HAND OR EYE COULD FRAME THY FEARFUL SYMMETRY 
IN WHAT DISTANT DEEPS OR SKIES BURNED THE FIRE OF THINE EYES 
ON WHAT WINGS DARE HE ASPIRE 
WHAT THE HAND DARE SEIZE THE FIRE 
AND WHAT SHOULDER AND WHAT ART COULD TWIST THE SINEWS OF THY HEART 
AND WHEN THY HEART BEGAN TO BEAT WHAT DREAD HAND AND WHAT DREAD FEET 
WHAT THE HAMMER WHAT THE CHAIN IN WHAT FURNACE WAS THY BRAIN 
WHAT THE ANVIL WHAT DREAD GRASP DARE ITS DEADLY TERRORS CLASP 
WHEN THE STARS THREW DOWN THEIR SPEARS AND WATERED HEAVEN WITH THEIR TEARS 
DID HE SMILE HIS WORK TO SEE 
DID HE WHO MADE THE LAMB MAKE THEE 
TYGER TYGER BURNING BRIGHT IN THE FORESTS OF THE NIGHT 
WHAT IMMORTAL HAND OR EYE DARE FRAME THY FEARFUL SYMMETRY 
POEMS WHICH HAVE A REGULAR RHYTHM 
LIKE THE TYGER OFTEN USE A REGULAR RHYME TOO 
WORDS THAT RHYME CREATE ECHOES WORKING WITH 
THE RHYTHM TO PRODUCE PATTERNS OF SOUND 
IN WHAT DISTANT DEEPS OR SKIES BURNT THE FIRE OF THINE EYES 
ON WHAT WINGS DARE HE ASPIRE 
WHAT THE HAND DARE SEIZE THE FIRE 
THERE ARE REGULAR RHYMES IN THE POEM WHICH COME IN EVERY LINE 
BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME WHICH COME IN THE MIDDLE OF LINES 
THIS INCREASES THE EFFECT OF A TIGER STALKING 
REPETITION OF SOUNDS WHETHER IT'S IN A POEM OR A PIECE OF NARRATIVE 
HAS AN EFFECT ON THE READER 
AND WHAT'S THE BEST WAY OF DISCOVERING THE PATTERNS OF 
SOUND IN A PASSAGE OR POEM 
READ IT ALOUD 
THE RHYMES ARE PLACED CAREFULLY TO GIVE KEY WORDS EMPHASIS 
FOR EXAMPLE FIRE SLASH ASPIRE SKIES SLASH EYES 
THE RHYMING OF THE POEM FLOWS WELL WHICH ENHANCES THE RHYTHM 
ALL THE LINES ARE OF A SIMILAR LENGTH SO WE DON'T READ IT 
HESITANTLY BECAUSE IT JUST FLOWS 
OF COURSE IN THE TEST 
YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY SPEAK OUT LOUD BUT IT REALLY HELPS TO READ THE TEXT 
ON THE PAPER AS IF YOU WERE READING IT ALOUD IN YOUR HEAD 
THIS STOPS YOU SKIMMING OR READING THE TEXT VERY QUICKLY AND LETTING 
IT ALL RUN INTO ONE BLUR 
ONE THING YOU CAN DO IN THE EXAM IS HIGHLIGHT THE WORDS THAT ARE 
EMPHASISED BY THE RHYME AND RHYTHM 
ASK YOURSELF WHY THE WRITER WANTED TO EMPHASISE THESE WORDS 
DO THEY CARRY A SPECIFIC MEANING OR MESSAGE 
THE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT POETRY RELATES TO IMAGERY 
IT'S A VAGUE TERM AND HARD TO DEFINE 
BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE WRITER'S USE OF PARTICULAR WORDS AND PHRASES 
TO CREATE AN IMAGE IN YOUR MIND 
IMAGERY ACTS LIKE A TRIGGER IN YOUR IMAGINATION 
WHY DON'T YOU PAUSE HERE REWIND THE PROGRAMME 
AND LISTEN TO THE TYGER POEM AGAIN 
JOT DOWN SOME OF THE IMAGES IT CONJURES AS YOU HEAR IT 
WHAT DID YOU SEE IN YOUR HEAD AS YOU HEARD THE TYGER POEM 
LISTEN TO WHAT THE POET LIZ LOCHHEAD HAS TO SAY ABOUT BLAKE'S IMAGERY 
THE IMAGERY IN THE TYGER IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING 
HE USES BURNING BRIGHT STRIPES LIKE FLAMES THOSE EYES BLAZING 
AND THEN HE GOES ON TO HAMMER FURNACE ANVIL 
ALL THESE WORDS WHICH COME OUT OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
WHICH WAS GOING ON ALL AROUND BLAKE AS HE WAS WRITING 
IT'S NOT AS IF THE POEM IS ABOUT THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
THE POEM IS ABOUT A TIGER AND ABOUT THE CREATOR OF THE TIGER 
BUT WHEN HE WANTED TO GIVE US A PICTURE 
OF A TERRIFYING TERRIBLE AND AWESOME GOD 
HE WANTED AT THE SAME TIME TO USE THE PICTURES HE HAD AROUND HIM 
SO HE PRESENTED GOD AS THE MASTER OF A RATHER HELLISH FORGE AND FURNACE 
HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF IMAGERY 
A BIT OF JUNGLE IN THE STREET HE GOES ON VELVET TOES 
AND SLINKING THROUGH THE SHADOWS STALKS IMAGINARY FOES 
IN THE ALLEY CAT THE WORLD VELVET 
GIVES THE IDEA THAT THE CAT'S QUITE SINISTER 
I THINK IT'S CUSHIONING THE SOUND OF THE CLAWS ON 
THE PAVEMENT AND GIVES THE IDEA THAT IT'S QUITE SPOOKY THE CAT 
THE WORDING REMINDS ME OF A TIGER THAT'S LIKE QUITE WILD 
THE FIRST LINE A BIT OF JUNGLE IN THE STREET GIVES THE IDEA THAT 
THE CAT IS A STRAY CAT AND THAT IT'S SURVIVING 
IN THE JUNGLE WHICH IS A STREET 
THAT POEM IS ONLY FOUR LINES LONG BUT IT SAYS SO MUCH 
AND THAT'S HOW IMAGERY WORKS 
A BIT OF JUNGLE IN THE STREET 
IT THROWS TOGETHER JUNGLE AND STREET TO PUT TOGETHER THE TWO THINGS 
THE POET WANTED TO SAY ABOUT AN ALLEY CAT 
IT'S SCRUFFY AND ORDINARY BUT WILD AND RUTHLESS AT THE SAME TIME 
WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IMAGERY IT HELPS TO CONSIDER THE THREE MAIN 
TECHNIQUES WHICH WRITERS USE 
SIMILE METAPHOR AND PERSONIFICATION 
IF YOU WANT TO GIVE SOMEONE A VERY 
CLEAR PICTURE YOU MIGHT MAKE A DIRECT COMPARISON 
THAT'S A SIMILE SAYING SOMETHING IS SIMILAR TO SOMETHING ELSE 
FOR EXAMPLE MY BROTHER'S HEAD IS A STRANGE SHAPE 
LIKE AN EGG WITH HAIR 
IT'S A VERY DIRECT AND PRECISE IMAGE 
A METAPHOR DOES THE SAME THING IN A MORE SUBTLE WAY 
IT DOESN'T MAKE THE ACTUAL COMPARISON 
BUT IT PUTS WORDS TOGETHER SO THAT ONE THING ACTUALLY BECOMES ANOTHER 
THIS LETS YOU MAKE WHATEVER COMPARISON YOU WANT 
YOU MIGHT SAY THE KEY STAGE THREE TEST IS A DARK CLOUD ON MY HORIZON 
OR AFTER THE TEST YOU MIGHT SAY I WAS GLOWING WITH PRIDE 
WHEN I GOT MY TEST RESULTS 
NOW OBVIOUSLY THE KEY STAGE THREE TEST ISN'T REALLY A CLOUD 
IT MAY FEEL LIKE IT BUT IT'S NOT 
WHEN YOU'VE DONE BRILLIANTLY IN THE TEST YOU WON'T ACTUALLY BE GLOWING 
BUT YOU MAY FEEL AS IF YOU ARE 
AND FINALLY PERSONIFICATION IS THE WAY A WRITER WILL DESCRIBE 
SOMETHING IN A HUMAN FORM 
FOR EXAMPLE THE RAIN BATTERED AT THE WINDOW TRYING TO FIND A WAY IN 
IF WE GO BACK OVER THE POEMS AND THE PROSE WE LOOKED AT IN THE 
EARLIER UNIT ON NARRATIVES THERE ARE SOME REALLY POWERFUL IMAGES 
TO THINK ABOUT AND WE CAN SEE EXAMPLES OF ALL THESE TECHNIQUES 
THAT'S WHEN THE DARKNESS ROARED 
HE CLUNG TO THE DARK AND IT CLUNG TO HIM 
FOG CREEPING INTO THE CABOOSES OF COLLIER BRIGS FOG LYING OUT 
ON THE YARDS AND HOVERING IN THE RIGGING OF GREAT SHIPS 
THE SORT OF QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT GET 
IN THE TEST ON POETRY WILL BE SOMETHING LIKE 
OR 
OR 
TO ANSWER THESE HERE ARE SOME KEY POINTS YOU NEED TO REMEMBER 
IF YOU OPEN YOUR TEST PAPER AND FIND 
A POEM TRY TO READ THE POEM ALOUD IN YOUR HEAD 
THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO HEAR THE RHYTHM AND RHYME AND REMEMBER 
READ BY THE PUNCTUATION MARKS RATHER THEN THE LINES 
THE PUNCTUATION WILL TELL YOU WHERE THE PAUSES ARE 
THEN LOOK AT THE WAY THE 
AUTHOR HAS USED WORDS AND PHRASES TO CREATE THE IMAGERY PARTICULARLY 
IN YOUR ENGLISH TEST AS WELL AS ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT 
OTHER PEOPLE'S FICTION WRITING YOU GET THE CHANCE TO WRITE YOUR OWN 
THERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS WHICH TEST YOUR ABILITY TO WRITE 
ONE IS THE SHORTER WRITING EXERCISE 
AND THE OTHER IS THE LONGER WRITING TASK 
YOU HAVE FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO DO THE LONGER 
WRITING TASK AND MARKS ARE GIVEN FOR 
THERE'S A SEPARATE MARK FOR EACH OF THESE THREE STRANDS 
SENTENCE STRUCTURE AND PUNCTUATION TEXT STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION 
AND COMPOSITION AND EFFECT 
THE MARKS ARE GIVEN FOR YOUR IDEAS AND THE WAY YOU EXPRESS THEM IN 
YOUR WRITING AS WELL AS ACCURATE SPELLING PUNCTUATION AND GRAMMAR 
WHEN YOU'RE UNDER PRESSURE YOU'LL NEED SOMETHING 
TO HELP YOU FOCUS QUICKLY 
YOU'LL NEED A STRUCTURE 
THE THREE STEPS FOR SUCCESS 
IN WRITING NARRATIVES ARE THE SAME AS FOR WRITING NON LITERARY TEXTS 
PLANNING WRITING AND CHECKING 
AND IF YOU'RE PREPARED FOR EACH OF THESE YOU'LL HAVE A BETTER 
CHANCE OF WRITING REALLY WELL IN TEST CONDITIONS 
WHAT YOU NEED TO REMEMBER IS THAT BY THE TIME YOU GET TO 
DO YOUR OWN PIECE OF WRITING 
YOU WILL ALREADY HAVE ANSWERED QUESTIONS ON SOMEONE ELSE'S 
LET'S GO BACK TO SOME MAIN POINTS TO REMEMBER FROM 
THE LITERARY TEXTS WE COVERED EARLIER IN THIS PROGRAMME 
IN NARRATIVES WE LOOKED AT SUGGESTED MEANING 
AND HOW THIS WORKS WHEN WE READ ABOUT A CHARACTER 
THEN WE LOOKED AT USE OF LANGUAGE 
INCLUDING CHOICE OF VOCABULARY AND SENTENCE STRUCTURE 
AND THE SECTION ON POETRY LOOKED AT SPECIFIC EFFECTS SUCH AS HOW 
RHYTHM AND RHYME WORK TOGETHER AND THE IMPORTANCE OF POWERFUL IMAGERY 
BUT WHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO REMEMBER IS THAT THESE FEATURES WORK ACROSS 
MOST TEXTS NOT JUST PROSE AND POETRY 
IF YOU HAVE TO WRITE IMAGINATIVELY OR DESCRIPTIVELY IN THE TEST 
YOU'LL NEED TO KEEP ALL THESE THINGS IN MIND 
TO GIVE YOUR OWN WRITING IMPACT AND BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY RELATE 
IT TO YOUR PURPOSE AND AUDIENCE 
I TEND IN TESTS TO WRITE OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD SO THAT 
WAS SOMETHING I HAD TO LOOK FOR SO ADVICE TO STUDENTS WHO DO THAT 
KIND OF THING IS TO WRITE DOWN BULLET POINTS OR SPIDER DIAGRAMS AND MAKE 
SURE YOU KEEP TO THAT SO THAT YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE WRITING 
I LIST DOWN ALL OF THE EVENTS AND IDEAS I HAVE IN MY BRAIN AND 
THEN I THINK WHICH ONE IS THE BEST AND EASIEST TO UNDERSTAND 
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE STORY SO I DON'T END UP JUST PICKING OFF 
IDEAS FROM THE TOP OF MY HEAD 
THE WAY I DID IT WAS TO PUT ALL MY IDEAS DOWN IN BULLET POINTS AND 
THEN PRIORITISE THEM BY PUTTING NUMBERS ALTHOUGH ANOTHER GOOD WAY 
IS TO DO IT AS A FLOW CHART SO YOU KNOW THE ORDER 
AND THEN ONCE YOU'VE GOT YOUR IDEAS DOWN ON PAPER 
IT MAKES IT MUCH EASIER TO WRITE A BETTER END RESULT 
WHEN IT COMES TO IMAGINATIVE WRITING YOU NEED TO THINK OF A 
GOOD IDEA AND PLAN HOW YOU'RE GOING TO COMMUNICATE IT TO YOUR AUDIENCE 
IF IT'S AN ORIGINAL IDEA SOMETHING 
WHICH IS UNEXPECTED OR DIFFERENT YOU'RE IMMEDIATELY ONTO A WINNER 
THERE'S NO FORMULA FOR HAVING A BRILLIANT IDEA 
BUT YOU CAN TAKE A MINUTE OR SO TO ASK YOURSELF WHETHER YOU'RE GIVING 
THE EXAMINER SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
FOR EXAMPLE 
LET'S SAY YOU'RE ASKED TO WRITE A DESCRIPTION OF A COASTLINE 
YOU MIGHT START TO THINK STRAIGHT AWAY ABOUT A CROWDED BEACH 
CHILDREN PLAYING DECK CHAIRS SUN SHINING HAPPY SOUNDS 
BUT IF YOU STOP FOR A MOMENT 
YOU MIGHT REALISE THAT'S BEEN DONE BEFORE 
WHAT ABOUT TURNING THAT ON ITS HEAD 
NOT CROWDED BUT DESERTED MAYBE 
NOT SUMMER BUT WINTER 
NOT LOVELY AND INVITING BUT COVERED IN OIL AND POLLUTED 
IT'S NOT A PRETTY PICTURE BUT IT'S ORIGINAL 
AND THAT MEANS IMPACT 
NEXT THINK WHAT OVERALL EFFECT YOU WANT TO HAVE ON YOUR READERS 
DO YOU WANT TO FRIGHTEN THEM 
AMUSE THEM 
YOUR OPENING SENTENCE IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL HERE 
PRACTISE IT SO IT WILL HAVE MAXIMUM IMPACT AND SET THE 
TONE FOR THE REST OF THE PIECE 
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WERE WRITING A HORROR STORY YOU MIGHT START 
BUT IF YOU WERE TRYING TO AMUSE THE READERS YOU COULD START LIKE THIS 
WORK OUT A PARAGRAPH PLAN WHICH WILL MAKE SURE YOU CAN WORK EFFECTIVELY 
WITHIN THE TIME YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR WRITING AROUND THIRTY MINUTES 
AND FINALLY DON'T FORGET TO THINK ABOUT HOW 
YOU'RE GOING TO END YOUR WRITING 
THE NEXT STEP IS THE WRITING ITSELF 
THIS IS MORE OF AN INSTINCTIVE THING BUT YOU NEED SOME 
CLEAR IDEAS IN YOUR HEAD WHICH WILL KEEP YOU ON TRACK 
WHEN YOU START YOUR OWN PIECE OF WRITING TRY TO COME UP WITH 
THE BEST IDEA IN THE TIME AVAILABLE 
AND KEEP THINKING ABOUT THE EFFECT YOU WANT TO HAVE ON YOUR READER 
DESCRIBING SOMETHING ALWAYS MEANS CHOOSING AND USING WORDS 
AND THERE ARE SO MANY TO CHOOSE FROM THAT SOMETIMES IT'S QUITE 
EASY TO TALK AND TALK AND GET CARRIED AWAY AND NOT REALLY SAY WHAT YOU MEAN 
AT ALL UNTIL IN THE END EVERYONE ELSE IS AS CONFUSED AS YOU ARE 
IT'S UP TO US TO CHOOSE WHICH WORDS TO USE 
THE MORE CAREFULLY YOU CHOOSE THE MORE ACCURATE A PICTURE 
YOU COMMUNICATE TO OTHER PEOPLE 
A CAT WHAT KIND OF CAT 
A BIG STRIPY CAT 
WHAT LIKE MY TIDDLES AT HOME 
NO NO A WILD CAT 
A JUNGLE CAT A TIGER 
RIGHT SO WHAT ABOUT IT 
WHAT ABOUT WHAT WHAT ABOUT THIS TIGER MAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
WELL WHAT'S IT DOING DOING 
WELL IT'S MOVING ISN'T IT 
MOVING WHAT RUNNING RAPIDLY 
SNEAKING SLOWLY JUMPING JOYOUSLY 
OR DOING THE HOKEY COKEY NO 
IT'S WALKING SOFTLY ON ITS PAWS LOOKING OUT FOR DANGER I SEE 
PADDING WARILY 
PADDING WARILY WHERE IS IT DOING THIS WARY PADDING THEN WHERE 
IN THE JUNGLE 
WHEREABOUTS IN THE JUNGLE 
IN THE TREES BY THE STREAM 
AMONG THE LEAVES 
WHAT ARE THE LEAVES LIKE 
WELL THEY'RE LIKE 
LEAVES AREN'T THEY 
YOU KNOW GREEN AND THAT BORING 
BORING YEAH 
WHAT DO THEY LOOK LIKE THESE LEAVES 
WELL THEY'RE LONG AND NARROW AND THEY WAVE ABOUT 
AND THEY END IN LITTLE POINTS 
WHAT LIKE LONG GREEN FINGERS WITH SHARP NAILS 
YEAH YEAH YEAH 
SUPPOSE SO SO THE JUNGLE CAT'S PADDING WARILY AMONG LONG 
GREEN SHARP NAIL LEAVES 
NO THE TIGER'S WALKING IN THE JUNGLE INNIT 
OH I GIVE UP 
IF YOU CAN ASK YOURSELF QUESTIONS LIKE THAT YOU'LL BE SURE YOU'RE 
GIVING THE READER ENOUGH DETAIL AND PICTURES THAT ARE VIVID AND STRONG 
WHEN DOING YOUR OWN PIECE OF IMAGINATIVE WRITING REMEMBER TO 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT SOME SENTENCES TO SEE IF WE CAN 
IMPROVE THE CHOICE OF WORDS 
YOU CAN ASK YOURSELF WHETHER GOOD 
IS REALLY THE WORD YOU WANT 
YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS 
OR IF YOU SAID JASON IS A GOOD PERSON 
YOU COULD CHOOSE FROM 
TODD AND BLOD THE STORY CONTINUES 
I'VE ALWAYS FANCIED A GO ON A LAND YACHT 
SO WHERE'S OURS TODD RIGHT THERE BLOD 
I BOUGHT IT IN KIT FORM 
I HAVEN'T STUCK THE BITS TOGETHER YET 
JUST LIKE YOUR SENTENCES TODD 
JAMES KNEW ABOUT CATS HE TRAINED DOG FOOD TO SNIFF OUT EXPLOSIVES 
DOG FOOD HAD A BIONIC NOSE 
HE COULD SMELL DYNAMITE AT A HUNDRED PACES 
THEY'RE PROPER SENTENCES 
BUT THEY'RE ALL SEPARATE BITS OF INFORMATION 
YOU HAVEN'T WELDED THEM TOGETHER 
BY WELDING THEM TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE MUCH BETTER SENTENCES 
HOW DO WE DO THAT THEN 
LOOK THIS IS YOUR FIRST SENTENCE 
JAMES KNEW ABOUT CATS IS IT 
THIS IS YOUR SECOND SENTENCE 
HE TRAINED DOG FOOD TO SNIFF OUT EXPLOSIVES 
BLOD BLOD 
NOW I'LL COMBINE THE TWO 
JAMES WHO KNEW ABOUT CATS 
TRAINED DOG FOOD TO SNIFF OUT EXPLOSIVES SEE YES 
LET'S JUST LEAVE THE CONSTRUCTION TO ME BLOD 
GOT TO USE THE RIGHT CONNECTORS 
EXACTLY WHAT I WAS SAYING TODD NOW 
WE'LL SAY THIS IS YOUR THIRD SENTENCE OH NO 
DOG FOOD HAD A BIONIC NOSE 
AND THIS IS YOUR FOURTH 
DOG FOOD COULD SMELL DYNAMITE AT A HUNDRED PACES 
HOW COULD WE CONNECT THESE TWO 
NOT WITH THAT 
OH SHAME 
SO HOW DO WE CONNECT THEM LIKE THE OTHER TWO 
DOG FOOD WHO HAD A BIONIC NOSE COULD SMELL EXPLOSIVES AT 
GOOD 
BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS 
FOR EXAMPLE USING HIS BIONIC NOSE DOG FOOD COULD SMELL EXPLOSIVES 
AT A HUNDRED PACES 
AND USING MY GREATER PRACTICAL SKILLS I WILL MAKE THE LAND YACHT 
I THINK YOU'RE GETTING IT TODD 
OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY WAYS OF CONNECTING SENTENCES 
AS DOG FOOD HAD A BIONIC NOSE 
HE COULD SMELL EXPLOSIVES AT A HUNDRED PACES 
THE BIONIC NOSE TO DOG FOOD COULD SMELL 
EXPLOSIVES AT A HUNDRED PACES 
OH VERY GOOD 
A MARVELLOUS CONSTRUCTION TODD 
TODD STREET SAILING ACROSS THE SAND COMPLETED ANOTHER 
BRILLIANT SENTENCE 
IN THE TEST YOU NEED TO 
CHECKING IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL 
IF YOU GIVE YOURSELF FIVE MINUTES TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO YOUR WORK 
YOU CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
TRY TO HEAR THE PASSAGE YOU HAVE WRITTEN READ ALOUD IN YOUR HEAD 
BECAUSE ONE OF THE WEAKNESSES THAT MARKERS COMPLAIN ABOUT IS PUPILS 
WRITING IN A PARTICULAR STYLE 
AND THEN CHOOSING AN INAPPROPRIATE WORD OR PHRASE SOMETHING THAT JARS 
AND IF YOU CAN HEAR THE FLOW THE TONE THE STYLE OF YOUR WRITING 
BY HEARING IT ALOUD AS IT WERE IN YOUR HEAD 
IT MIGHT JUST BE THE CASE THAT YOU 
CAN SPOT THOSE WORDS WHICH ARE NOT QUITE APPROPRIATE AND CHANGE THEM 
IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EXAM THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS STOP WRITING 
SO YOU CAN HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO CHECK OVER WHAT YOU'VE DONE WHEN 
YOU'VE GOT MANY MORE IDEAS THAT YOU'D RATHER GET DOWN AND GET MORE MARKS 
BUT YOU'RE ALSO MARKED ON SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION 
SO IT REALLY IS WORTH IT TAKING FIVE MINUTES OUT AT THE END TO JUST GO 
OVER IT AND MARK IT YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU WILL GAIN MORE MARKS THIS WAY 
OUR TEACHER TAUGHT US TO REMEMBER A WAY OF SAYING SPAG 
IT STANDS FOR SPELLING PUNCTUATION AND GRAMMAR 
THOSE ARE THE THREE THINGS THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT 
AND DON'T FORGET TO USE THINGS LIKE FULL STOPS AND COMMAS 
EVEN THOUGH IT SOUNDS A BIT SILLY 
YOU REALLY NEED TO CONCENTRATE BECAUSE IN TEST CONDITIONS 
YOU DO TEND TO FORGET THINGS LIKE THAT 
THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION TO ASK YOURSELF IS WHETHER YOUR PUNCTUATION 
IS HELPING THE READER 
ARE YOU PROVIDING THE RIGHT SIGNPOSTS 
SO THAT THE PAUSES ARE CLEAR 
READ YOUR WORK ALOUD TO YOURSELF AND MAKE CHANGES 
ESPECIALLY TO SENTENCES WHICH HAVE BEGUN TO RAMBLE 
THEN BE REALLY CRITICAL OF THE WORDS YOU'VE CHOSEN 
CONCENTRATE ON PARTICULAR WORDS OR PHRASES 
COULD THEY BE CHANGED SO THEY'RE MORE EXPRESSIVE 
THINK ABOUT YOUR CLOSING SENTENCE IN PARTICULAR 
HAVE YOU FINISHED YOUR WRITING IN STYLE 
AND LOOK CAREFULLY AT WORDS WHICH YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TROUBLE SPELLING 
IF THEY DON'T LOOK RIGHT THEN THEY PROBABLY AREN'T RIGHT 
FINALLY DON'T WORRY ABOUT UNTIDINESS 
IF YOU'VE MADE CHANGES CLEARLY 
THE EXAMINERS WHO MARK YOUR TEST WON'T WORRY 
IN FACT IT'LL PROBABLY IMPRESS THEM 
TO KNOW YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT YOUR WORK 
REMEMBER TO PLAN SO THAT YOU'VE THOUGHT THROUGH THE BEGINNING 
MIDDLE AND THE ENDING OF YOUR PIECE 
VARY YOUR SENTENCE STRUCTURE TO KEEP YOUR READER INTERESTED 
CHOOSE WORDS WHICH HAVE THE RIGHT EFFECT ON YOUR READER 
AND GIVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DESCRIBE 
FINALLY CHECK YOUR WORK TO MAKE SURE YOU'VE SPOTTED MARK LOSERS 
SUCH AS POOR SPELLING PUNCTUATION AND GRAMMAR 
IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER HOW TO SPELL A PARTICULAR WORD USE ANOTHER 
THIS IS THE END OF THE SECTION ON LITERARY TEXTS 
YOU CAN PLAY IT BACK AS MANY TIMES AS YOU LIKE 
UNTIL YOU FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT IT 
TAKE A BREAK HERE OR IF YOU PREFER 
MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SECTION ON SHAKESPEARE 
THIS PART OF THE PROGRAMME LOOKS AT THE SHAKESPEARE PAPER 
ALL SHAKESPEARE LEFT US WERE THE PLAYS WRITTEN DOWN THERE AREN'T 
ANY NOTES ATTACHED TO THEM TO EXPLAIN WHAT WAS ON HIS MIND 
HE COULDN'T HAVE DONE ANY INTERVIEWS ON T. V. AND THE ONLY STAGE DIRECTIONS 
HE GAVE US WERE ENTRANCES AND EXITS 
SO THE REST IS UP TO YOU 
THE WORDS ON THE PAGE ARE JUST A STARTING POINT AND THE PEOPLE WHO 
SET THE QUESTIONS WILL WANT TO KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE IDEAS 
ABOUT HOW THE WORDS SHOULD BE PERFORMED 
IDEALLY TO GIVE SOMEONE YOUR RESPONSE TO A SHAKESPEARE SCENE 
YOU'D GET UP AND ACT IT 
SO TO ANSWER THE TEST QUESTIONS YOU HAVE TO TRY AND IMAGINE THAT'S 
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
GETTING INTO THE MINDS OF THE CHARACTERS SAYING THE WORDS ALOUD 
AND DECIDING HOW YOU WOULD ACT IN THE SCENE 
IF IT WILL FEED NOTHING ELSE IT WILL FEED MY REVENGE 
HATH NOT A JEW SENSES 
IF YOU PRICK US 
DO WE NOT BLEED 
IF YOU TICKLE US DO WE NOT LAUGH 
AND IF YOU WRONG US SHALL WE NOT REVENGE 
QUESTIONS MAY BE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS AND THEIR MOTIVATION OR 
ABOUT THE EFFECT THE SCENE MIGHT HAVE ON AN AUDIENCE 
THROUGH THE WAY IT'S DIRECTED OR STAGED 
OR ABOUT IDEAS AND THEMES WITHIN THE SECTION STUDIED 
OR THE WAY SHAKESPEARE USES LANGUAGE 
THE MAIN POINTS TO REMEMBER IN ORDER TO BE REALLY PREPARED ARE 
TO LOOK AT CHARACTER AND MOTIVATION 
WHAT'S MAKING THE CHARACTERS SAY WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IN THE SCENE 
HOW DO THE MAIN CHARACTERS DEVELOP THROUGH THE SCENE 
AND HOW DOES SHAKESPEARE CREATE A DRAMATIC EFFECT 
THROUGH HIS USE OF LANGUAGE 
IF YOU FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT THESE POINTS 
YOU SHOULD BE VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT TACKLING THE QUESTIONS IN THE TEST 
WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THESE POINTS THROUGH TWO SCENES IN MACBETH 
WHICH TAKE PLACE NEAR THE START OF THE PLAY 
THE STRUCTURE WE'LL GIVE YOU WILL WORK WITH 
WHATEVER SCENE OR PLAY YOU'RE STUDYING 
WHEN YOU'RE PREPARING FOR YOUR SHAKESPEARE TEST THE BEST THING 
TO DO IS GET INVOLVED IN ACTING OUT THE SCENES WORKING OUT WHAT'S GOING 
ON NOT BY SITTING IN YOUR CHAIR BUT BY GETTING UP AND MOVING AROUND AND 
GETTING INSIDE THE CHARACTERS 
YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW THAT SCENE IN DETAIL 
BUT ONE OF THE BEST THINGS YOU CAN DO IS GO AND SEE A PERFORMANCE 
THEN YOU'LL SEE HOW SOME OTHER PERSON THOUGHT YOUR SCENE SHOULD WORK OUT 
AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO COMPARE THAT WITH WHAT YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT 
AND YOU'LL GET AN IDEA OF HOW THE SCENE FITS INTO THE REST OF THE PLAY 
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW THE PLAY MACBETH 
LET'S SET THE SCENE FOR YOU 
THE PLAY'S SET IN SCOTLAND IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY A VIOLENT AND 
TROUBLED TIME WHEN WARLORD THANES WERE FIGHTING AMONGST THEMSELVES 
MACBETH IS A BRAVE WARRIOR 
WHO LEADS HIS TROOPS TO A FAMOUS VICTORY 
JUST AFTER THE BATTLE MACBETH AND HIS FRIEND BANQUO 
MEET THE THREE WITCHES WHO PROPHESY MACBETH WILL BE KING 
HAIL TO THEE THANE OF CAWDOR 
ALL HAIL MACBETH 
IMMEDIATELY AMBITIOUS THOUGHTS BEGIN TO WELL UP INSIDE MACBETH 
HE CAN HARDLY CONTROL HIMSELF 
HE WRITES A LETTER TO HIS WIFE TO TELL HER ABOUT THE PROPHECY 
AND AS SOON AS SHE'S FINISHED READING IT'S DECIDED 
BY ANY MEANS MACBETH HER HUSBAND IS GOING TO BE KING 
SHE ALSO KNOWS THAT MURDERING KING DUNCAN IS THE ONLY WAY OF 
ACHIEVING THIS QUICKLY 
WHEN MACBETH BRINGS FURTHER NEWS THAT KING DUNCAN IS ACTUALLY COMING 
TO SPEND THAT NIGHT WITH THEM LADY MACBETH REALISES THAT HER ROLE 
IS TO SEIZE THE MOMENT 
SHE SUGGESTS HER PLAN TO MACBETH 
HE DOESN'T SAY YES BUT HE DOESN'T SAY NO EITHER 
HE NEEDS TIME TO THINK 
ALL HE SAYS IS WE WILL SPEAK FURTHER 
THINKING ABOUT CHARACTER AND MOTIVATION 
IS ABOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CHARACTERS IN EACH SCENE 
AND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR HEADS 
MOTIVATION IS WHAT MAKES THEM SAY WHAT THEY SAY OR DO WHAT THEY DO 
SOMEBODY IN AN ARGUMENT MIGHT BE MOTIVATED BY ANGER 
WHILE ANOTHER MIGHT BE MOTIVATED BY ANXIETY OR WORRY 
TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS STRAIGHT ABOUT CHARACTER AND MOTIVATION IT'S BEST 
TO DECIDE ON KEY QUESTIONS 
BUT 
ONES THAT ARE RIGHT AT THE HEART OF THE SCENE 
IF YOU CAN MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND ABOUT THESE 
YOU'LL ARRIVE AT YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU THROUGH ACT ONE SCENE SEVEN OF MACBETH 
WHILE KING DUNCAN IS ENJOYING THE MACBETHS' HOSPITALITY MACBETH AND 
HIS WIFE HAVE A SECRET CONVERSATION JUST OFF THE BANQUETING HALL WHERE 
LADY MACBETH CONVINCES HER HUSBAND TO GO THROUGH WITH THE MURDER 
THE TWO KEY QUESTIONS WE ASK ARE 
IF YOU CAN ANSWER THESE TWO QUESTIONS YOU'LL UNDERSTAND 
SOMETHING ABOUT THE CHARACTERS' MOTIVATION IN THIS SECTION 
YOU MAY ALREADY HAVE YOUR OWN IDEAS BUT WE'LL TAKE THE QUESTIONS 
ONE AT A TIME STARTING WITH THE ONE ABOUT LADY MACBETH 
LET'S HEAR FROM LOUISE LOMBARD WHO IS PREPARING TO PLAY THE PART 
TO DO THIS SHE NEEDS TO ASK THE SAME KEY QUESTIONS AS YOU DO 
WHEN PREPARING FOR YOUR TEST 
I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PLAY LADY MACBETH AND THIS COULD BE A PROBLEM 
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY LADY MACBETH IS TRADITIONALLY PORTRAYED 
SHE'S EVIL PERSONIFIED 
IT'S LIKE SHE'S PLAYED WITH A SEVERE STRONG FACE AND LONG FIERY HAIR 
AND A KIND OF MANIC LOOK IN THE EYE YOU KNOW 
AND IN THE SCENE THAT WE'RE DOING 
WHERE SHE'S PERSUADING THE DOUBTING MACBETH TO GO THROUGH WITH THE MURDER 
WE WILL PROCEED NO FURTHER IN THIS BUSINESS ART THOU AFEARD 
IF WE SHOULD FAIL WE FAIL 
YOU JUST THINK THIS WOMAN IS LIKE A PANTOMIME WITCH 
RUTHLESS AMBITIOUS I MEAN SERIOUSLY BAD NEWS 
HE HATH ALMOST SUPP'D WHY HAVE YOU LEFT THE CHAMBER 
HATH HE ASK'D FOR ME KNOW YOU NOT HE HAS 
WE WILL PROCEED NO FURTHER IN THIS BUSINESS 
HE HATH HONOUR'D ME OF LATE I HAVE BOUGHT GOLDEN OPINIONS OF ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE 
WHICH WOULD BE WORN NOW IN THEIR NEWEST GLOSS NOT CAST ASIDE SO SOON 
WAS THE HOPE DRUNK WHEREIN YOU DRESS'D YOURSELF 
HATH IT SLEPT SINCE 
AND WAKES IT NOW TO LOOK SO GREEN AND PALE 
AT WHAT IT DID SO FREELY 
FROM THIS TIME SUCH I ACCOUNT THY LOVE 
ART THOU AFEARD 
TO BE THE SAME IN THINE OWN ACT AND VALOUR 
AS THOU ART IN DESIRE 
WOULDST THOU HAVE THAT WHICH THOU ESTEEMS THE ORNAMENT OF LIFE 
AND LIVE A COWARD IN THY OWN ESTEEM 
LETTING I DARE NOT WAIT UPON I WOULD 
LIKE THE POOR CAT I. T. H. ADAGE PRITHEE PEACE 
THAT LADY MACBETH WAS IF YOU LIKE THE EVIL VERSION 
SHE MOVES AWAY HE FOLLOWS 
SHE BAITS HIM SHE GOADS HIM SHE TAUNTS HIS SEXUALITY 
I DIDN'T FEEL THERE WAS VERY MUCH LOVE BETWEEN THOSE TWO 
IT'S LIKE YOU WILL DO THIS BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO 
IT'S VERY STRONG BUT I DON'T WANT TO PLAY LADY MACBETH LIKE THAT 
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THEY'RE IN THIS THING TOGETHER 
I WANT TO SHOW HER SUPPORTING HIM REKINDLING HIS AMBITIONS 
NOW I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT YES SHE FEELS LET DOWN 
YES SHE FEELS BETRAYED BUT SHE DOES LOVE HIM 
SHE WANTS HIM TO BE SOMETHING 
AND SHE WANTS TO BE A PART OF HIS SUCCESS 
YOU CAN EITHER JUST DISMISS LADY MACBETH 
AS A DEMON WOMAN OR YOU CAN TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHERE SHE'S COMING FROM 
LIKE FOR A START YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT THE WORLD THESE CHARACTERS 
INHABIT THE ATTITUDES OF THE DAY 
I THINK WE'RE MEANT TO THINK OF THIS WORLD AS RUTHLESS SAVAGE 
LESS ORDERED THAN THE WORLD WE LIVE IN NOW 
EVERYONE'S ARMED EVERYONE'S LOOKING BACK OVER THEIR SHOULDER 
TO CHECK WHO'S OUT TO GET THEM 
KILLING'S MORE COMMONPLACE LESS REMARKABLE 
AND WOMEN IN THIS WORLD HAD A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE 
THEY HAD NO LEGAL RIGHTS WHATSOEVER NO POWER 
THEY WERE BASICALLY THEIR HUSBAND'S PROPERTY 
SO MAYBE THROUGH CONDITIONING 
THEY'D BE QUICKER TO SUPPORT THEIR HUSBANDS 
WHATEVER THEIR ASPIRATIONS IN ORDER TO DO WELL THEMSELVES' 
SO IT'S CLEAR WHAT SHE THINKS 
THE MOTIVATION FOR LADY MACBETH 
IS THAT SHE LOVES HER HUSBAND AND WANTS TO SEE HIM FULFILLED 
YOUR OWN VIEW MIGHT BE DIFFERENT 
WE'LL GO OVER THOSE POINTS ONE BY ONE AND SHOW YOU WHERE THEY 
CAN BE FOUND IN THE TEXT 
FIRSTLY YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT AS A WOMAN LIVING AT THAT TIME 
SHE'D HAVE HAD NO POWER TO CHANGE THINGS HERSELF AND CAN ONLY LIVE 
THROUGH HER HUSBAND'S ACHIEVEMENTS 
SHE'LL SACRIFICE HERSELF AND MAKE HERSELF EVIL TO MAKE HIM GREAT 
EARLIER SHE HAS INVITED THE SPIRITS OF EVIL TO ENTER HER 
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS SHE HAS TO STEEL HERSELF IN A MASCULINE WAY TO COME 
UP WITH THE PLAN IN THE FIRST PLACE 
UNSEX ME HERE SHE SAYS 
EVIL IS NOT NATURALLY WITHIN HER 
AND FINALLY SHE CAN'T DO THE MURDER HERSELF 
BECAUSE THE SLEEPING KING 
REMINDS HER TOO MUCH OF HER OWN FATHER 
THAT'S WHY SHE PERSUADES MACBETH TO KILL HIM 
THE QUESTION OF HOW SHE MANAGES THIS 
IS COVERED IN THE NEXT SECTION 
ON SHAKESPEARE'S LANGUAGE 
AND WHAT ABOUT MACBETH 
REMEMBER HE'D MADE UP HIS MIND NOT TO GO THROUGH WITH THE MURDER 
BECAUSE HE'S ENJOYING BEING IN DUNCAN'S FAVOUR AND BECAUSE DUNCAN 
IS AFTER ALL HIS COUSIN HIS WIFE HAS MADE HIM CHANGE HIS MIND 
SO YOU NEED TO DECIDE WHETHER MACBETH 
IS ACTING OF HIS OWN FREE WILL WHEN HE MURDERS DUNCAN 
SO ASK YOURSELF 
DOES HE REALLY MURDER DUNCAN 
JUST BECAUSE HIS WIFE 
TOLD HIM TO DO IT 
THE SCENE STARTS WITH A LONG 
SOLILOQUY THAT'S WHEN MACBETH 
IS ON HIS OWN 
TELLING US HIS THOUGHTS 
AS YOU WATCH AND LISTEN 
ASK YOURSELF IS THIS SOMEONE WHO GENUINELY 
DOESN'T WANT TO KILL OR SOMEONE WHO IS AFRAID OF BEING FOUND OUT 
IF IT WERE DONE WHEN TIS DONE THEN TWERE WELL 
IT WERE DONE QUICKLY IF THE ASSASSINATION 
COULD TRAMMEL UP THE CONSEQUENCE AND CATCH 
WITH HIS SURCEASE SUCCESS THAT BUT THIS BLOW 
MIGHT BE THE BE ALL AND THE END ALL HERE 
BUT HERE UPON THIS BANK AND SHOAL OF TIME 
WE'D JUMP THE LIFE TO COME 
BUT IN THESE CASES 
WE STILL HAVE JUDGMENT HERE THAT WE BUT TEACH 
BLOODY INSTRUCTIONS WHICH BEING TAUGHT RETURN 
TO PLAGUE THE INVENTOR THIS EVEN HANDED JUSTICE 
COMMENDS THE INGREDIENTS OF OUR POISON'D CHALICE 
TO OUR OWN LIPS 
HE'S HERE IN DOUBLE TRUST 
FIRST AS I AM HIS KINSMAN AND HIS SUBJECT 
STRONG BOTH AGAINST THE DEED THEN AS HIS HOST 
WHO SHOULD AGAINST HIS MURDERER SHUT THE DOOR 
NOT BEAR THE KNIFE MYSELF 
BESIDES THIS DUNCAN 
HATH BORNE HIS FACULTIES SO MEEK HATH BEEN 
SO CLEAR IN HIS GREAT OFFICE THAT HIS VIRTUES 
WILL PLEAD LIKE ANGELS TRUMPET TONGUED AGAINST 
THE DEEP DAMNATION OF HIS TAKING OFF 
AND PITY LIKE A NAKED NEW BORN BABE 
STRIDING THE BLAST OR HEAVEN'S CHERUBIMS HORSED 
UPON THE SIGHTLESS COURIERS OF THE AIR 
SHALL BLOW THE HORRID DEED IN EVERY EYE 
THAT TEARS SHALL DROWN THE WIND 
I HAVE NO SPUR 
TO PRICK THE SIDES OF MY INTENT BUT ONLY 
VAULTING AMBITION WHICH O'ERLEAPS ITSELF 
AND FALLS ON THE OTHER 
SO IS THIS SOMEONE WHO GENUINELY 
DOESN'T WANT TO KILL OR SOMEONE 
WHO IS AFRAID OF BEING FOUND OUT 
WHAT DID YOU THINK OUR VIEW IS THAT 
MACBETH DOES WANT THE KING DEAD 
BUT IS AFRAID OF BEING FOUND OUT 
IF YOU PUT HIS THOUGHTS INTO MODERN 
ENGLISH THEY'D READ LIKE THIS 
IF ONLY WE COULD GUARANTEE THAT 
KILLING DUNCAN WOULD END IT ALL 
FINISHED DONE WITH 
NEVER TO BE SPOKEN OF AGAIN 
IT'S BOUND TO COME BACK TO HAUNT US 
AND HE'S HERE AS MY GUEST 
I SHOULD BE PROTECTING HIM 
DUNCAN IS MY COUSIN 
A NORMAL HONEST GOOD PERSON 
SOMEHOW THAT GOODNESS WILL 
MAKE SURE THE TRUTH WILL COME OUT 
THIS IS JUST AMBITION 
IF WE THINK ABOUT IT WE CAN SEE 
THAT THE MAIN POINT IS THAT HE'S 
FRIGHTENED OF THE CONSEQUENCES 
HOWEVER THERE ARE OTHER STRONG 
ARGUMENTS PARTICULARLY 
ABOUT DUNCAN BEING A GOOD PERSON 
IT'S MAYBE ENOUGH TO STOP HIM 
BECOMING A MURDERER 
THEN HIS WIFE FINDS HIM 
HE HATH HONOUR'D ME OF LATE AND I HAVE BOUGHT 
GOLDEN OPINIONS FROM ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE 
WHICH WOULD BE WORN NOW IN THEIR NEWEST GLOSS 
NOT CAST ASIDE SO SOON 
WAS THE HOPE DRUNK WHEREIN YOU DRESS'D YOURSELF 
HATH IT SLEPT SINCE 
AND WAKES IT NOW TO LOOK SO GREEN AND PALE 
AT WHAT IT DID SO FREELY 
WOULDST THOU HAVE THAT 
WHICH THOU ESTEEM'ST THE ORNAMENT OF LIFE 
AND LIVE A COWARD IN THINE OWN ESTEEM 
LETTING I DARE NOT WAIT UPON I WOULD 
LIKE THE POOR CAT I. THE ADAGE 
PRITHEE PEACE 
I HAVE GIVEN SUCK AND KNOW 
HOW TENDER TIS TO LOVE THE BABE THAT MILKS ME 
I WOULD WHILE IT WAS SMILING IN MY FACE 
HAVE PLUCK'D MY NIPPLE FROM HIS BONELESS GUMS 
AND DASH'D THE BRAINS OUT HAD I SO SWORN AS YOU 
HAVE DONE TO THIS IF WE SHOULD FAIL 
WE FAIL 
BUT SCREW YOUR COURAGE TO THE STICKING PLACE 
AND WE'LL NOT FAIL 
WILL IT NOT BE RECEIVED 
WHEN WE HAVE MARK'D WITH BLOOD THOSE SLEEPY TWO 
OF HIS OWN CHAMBER AND USED THEIR VERY DAGGERS 
THAT THEY HAVE DONE'T 
HIS EXCUSES TO LADY MACBETH 
ABOUT HOW THE KING HAS BEEN 
GOOD TO HIM AND HAS FAVOURED HIM 
AREN'T REALLY CONVINCING ARE THEY 
WHY CAN'T HE TELL HER THE THOUGHTS 
HE HAD JUST SPOKEN TO US 
AND JUST THINK ABOUT IT IF HE 
REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO KILL DUNCAN 
HE WOULD HAVE RESISTED FOR LONGER 
LOOK HOW QUICKLY LADY MACBETH 
CHANGES HIS MIND IN THE END HE'S 
CONVINCED TO STICK TO THEIR PLAN 
AND EVEN IMPROVES 
ON THE ORIGINAL BRIEF 
IT'S HE WHO SUGGESTS 
THEY SMEAR THE GUARDS WITH BLOOD 
TO COVER THEIR TRACKS 
LET'S JUST GO THROUGH THE KEY POINTS 
YOU NEED TO REMEMBER 
ABOUT CHARACTER AND MOTIVATION 
AND WHEN YOU'VE DECIDED 
ON YOUR RESPONSE 
YOU NEED TO SHOW YOU HAVE YOUR OWN VIEW 
ABOUT THE MAIN CHARACTERS AND THEIR MOTIVATION 
AND BE ABLE TO BACK IT UP USING QUOTATIONS FROM THE PLAY 
YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW SHAKESPEARE USES LANGUAGE 
TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE AUDIENCE 
IT CAN HELP TO KNOW THAT HE USED THREE MAIN FORMS OF WRITING 
SOMETIMES HE WOULD WRITE AS MOST PEOPLE DO THESE DAYS 
IN PROSE 
FREQUENTLY IN SHAKESPEARE THIS IS WHEN A CHARACTER 
FROM A LOWER CLASS IS SPEAKING FOR EXAMPLE THE PORTER IN MACBETH 
KNOCK KNOCK WHO'S THERE IN THE OTHER DEVIL'S NAME 
FAITH HERE'S AN EQUIVOCATOR 
THAT COULD SWEAR IN BOTH THE SCALES AGAINST EITHER SCALE WHO COMMITTED 
TREASON ENOUGH FOR GOD'S SAKE YET COULD NOT EQUIVOCATE TO HEAVEN 
O. COME IN EQUIVOCATOR 
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK WHO'S THERE 
WHEN IN RAIN 
WHEN THE HURLY BURLY'S DONE 
AT OTHER TIMES HE WOULD USE RHYMING POETRY PERHAPS BETWEEN LOVERS 
TWO PEOPLE SHARING A JOKE OR EVEN WITCHES CASTING A SPELL 
FAIR IS FOUL AND FOUL IS FAIR 
HOVER THROUGH THE FOG AND FILTHY AIR 
MOST OF THE TIME THOUGH 
HE WROTE IN WHAT'S CALLED BLANK VERSE 
THIS IS A FORM OF WRITING IN TEN SYLLABLE LINES 
WITH A NATURAL PATTERN OF SOUNDS 
TO UNDERSTAND THIS PROPERLY WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE PLACE 
WHERE IT ALL BEGAN THE GLOBE THEATRE 
LET US HEAR WHAT ANTONY CAN SAY 
GENTLE ROMANS 
BE SO LET US HEAR HIM 
FRIENDS ROMANS COUNTRYMEN 
LEND ME YOUR EARS 
MERELY A SIGN OF DISBELIEF FROM THE GROUNDLINGS 
RUBBISH BOO 
BOO OOH 
BOO BOO 
STINKARDS 
IMAGINE PLAYING TO A CROWD OF THREE THOUSAND 
HALF OF WHOM HAVE PROBABLY DRUNK TOO MUCH 
COULD EASILY YELL ABUSE AT YOU 
AND WHAT IF HALF YOUR AUDIENCE GETS RAINED ON 
OR IT GETS DARK BEFORE THE PLAY'S FINISHED 
GOD KNOWS WHAT WOULD KEEP THEM ENTERTAINED 
THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE IS TO HAVE A HEALTHY IRREVERENCE FOR SHAKESPEARE 
AND IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF SAYING SOMETHING AND SOMEBODY 
SHOUTS SOMETHING BACK TO YOU YOU'VE GOT TWO CHOICES EITHER YOU KIND OF 
STEP BACK AND PRETEND THAT THE PERSON DIDN'T SAY IT IN WHICH 
CASE YOU'RE ON TO A LOSER BECAUSE HE NOW KNOWS HE'S GOT YOU YEAH 
OR IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM YOU ANSWER BACK BUT THE OTHER 
THING ABOUT IT IS THAT YOU ARE IN AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL POSITION HERE 
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PARTICULARLY CLEVER IN COMING BACK TO HIM 
A LOT OF THE TIME AND I'M SURE YOU SAW IT WHEN YOU SAW HENRY V. 
IS THAT ACTORS WILL JUST LOOK AT PEOPLE 
SO SOMEBODY WOULD SAY SOMETHING AND AN ACTOR WOULD JUST LOOK AT THEM 
AND IF THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEM 
THAT MEANS THAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS INVITED TO LOOK AT THEM 
DOTH FORTUNE PLAY THE HUSSY WITH ME NOW 
NEWS HAVE I THAT MY NELL IS DEAD IN THE SPITTLE 
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY MOBILE STAGE AS WELL 
WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS THE IDEAL OPPORTUNITY TO LITERALLY BLAST 
THE AUDIENCE WITH YOUR OWN POWER 
THERE ARE NO SPECIAL EFFECTS HERE BECAUSE THERE'S NO ROOM FOR THEM 
THERE'S NO BACKDROPS 
BECAUSE YOU'RE STARTING TO CUT OFF THE SIGHT LINES OF OTHER AUDIENCES 
THERE'S NO EXTRA SCENERY THAT CAN GO ROUND THE SIDE 
BECAUSE YOU'RE CUTTING OFF ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE 
IT'S NOT DESIGNED TO MAKE PICTURES IN 
NO NO IT'S TO GO OUT AND BLAST AWAY 
TO TALK TO GET DIRECT EYE CONTACT WITH PEOPLE 
THE GAME'S AFOOT 
FOLLOW YOUR SPIRIT 
AND UPON THIS CHARGE CRY 
GOD FOR HARRY ENGLAND AND SAINT GEORGE 
IN SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS THE LANGUAGE IS VERY IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE IT HAS TO DO ALL THE WORK 
THAT'S WHY THERE'S SO MUCH OF IT 
THERE WERE NO SPECIAL EFFECTS 
THE ACTOR HAD TO BLAST THE AUDIENCE 
PACK IT UP PACK IT IN 
LET ME BEGIN 
I CAME TO WIN BATTLE ME THAT'S A SIN 
I WON'T TEAR THE SACK UP PUNK YOU'D BETTER BACK UP 
HE HAS A RHYTHM AND IF YOU TAKE ON THAT RHYTHM 
IT DRIVES THE PLAY THROUGH AND IT EMPOWERS YOU 
THE FIRST TIME THAT I GET A SCRIPT AND WE'RE ASKED TO READ IT OUT ALOUD 
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THE WORDS 
UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND EVERY SINGLE WORD 
THEREFORE ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS YOU'RE SAYING AND DOING THEN YOU 
CAN USE THE LANGUAGE AS YOURS AND PLAY THE TRUTH OF IT 
AND YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING TO YOURSELF IF THESE WERE MY WORDS 
IF I WAS IN THIS SITUATION HOW WOULD I USE IT 
WHAT WOULD I SAY IF THESE WORDS 
SO IT REALLY COMES ALIVE WHEN YOU START SAYING IT OUT LOUD 
EXACTLY SO IF I SAY SOMETHING SUCH AS IN WINTER'S TALE WHEN I 
BRING NEWS OF THE QUEEN'S DEATH AND I COME ON AND I STOP EVERYTHING 
AND I SAY WOE THE WHILE IN REAL LIFE I WOULDN'T SAY WOE THE WHILE 
BUT I'VE GOT TO THINK I'M GOING TO STOP EVERYTHING USING THOSE WORDS 
WOE THE WHILE 
COME OVER HERE AND I'LL SHOW YOU A SCENE FROM WINTER'S TALE 
YOU'RE SHOWING ME A SCENE RIGHT 
AND WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO DO IS IF YOU CAN BE THE KING KING LEONTES 
MAYBE YOU CAN KNEEL DOWN HERE 
WHAT'S GOING ON 
WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT THE KING HAS LOST HIS SON WHO HAS DIED 
AND I'M BRINGING NEWS OF HIS QUEEN'S DEATH BAD DAY YES 
SO HE'S ALREADY FEELING VERY VERY 
UNHAPPY BECAUSE HE'S RESPONSIBLE 
AND I COME IN AND USING THE SHAKESPEARE I TELL HIM 
WHY HE IS RESPONSIBLE 
SO LET'S SEE IF WE CAN MAKE THE LANGUAGE MEAN A LITTLE MORE 
THAN JUST ON THE PAGE O. K. 
SO YOU CAN JUST BE THERE 
WOE THE WHILE 
O. CUT MY LACE LEST MY HEART CRACK ING IT 
BREAK TOO 
WHAT STUDIED TORMENTS TYRANT HAST FOR ME 
WHAT WHEELS RACKS FIRES WHAT FLAYING BOILING 
IN LEADS OR OILS 
WHAT OLD OR NEWER TORTURE 
MUST I RECEIVE WHOSE EVERY WORD DESERVES 
TO TASTE OF THY MOST WORST 
USE THE STAGE FULLY 
GET THE RIGHT RHYTHM PLAY TO THE AUDIENCE 
OH HOW YOU DO PLAGUE ME 
A PESTILENCE ON YOU GO HANG YOURSELF 
A BURNING DEVIL TAKE YOU WHORE SON 
BEETLE HEADED KNAVE 
BEETLE HEADED KNAVE OOH THAT'S GOOD 
SHAG SPAR 
WITHOUT A DOUBT YOU RABBLE OF VILE CONFEDERATES 
HERD OF BOILS AND PLAGUES FOUL AND PESTILENT CONGREGATION OF VAPOURS 
VERSE IS VERY EFFECTIVE IN SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS 
BECAUSE IT HELPS THE ACTORS FIND THE RHYTHM 
SO THE AUDIENCE FEELS 
THE IMPACT OF THE WORDS 
TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE LANGUAGE WORKS IN A PARTICULAR SCENE IT'S BEST TO 
FOLLOW THE CHANGES IN TONE 
WE'RE GOING TO RETURN TO MACBETH 
TO THE SCENE WHEN LADY MACBETH WELCOMES THE KING TO HER CASTLE 
AND THANK US FOR YOUR TROUBLE 
ALL OUR SERVICE 
IN EVERY POINT TWICE DONE AND THEN DONE DOUBLE 
WERE POOR AND SINGLE BUSINESS TO CONTEND 
AGAINST THOSE HONOURS DEEP AND BROAD WHEREWITH 
YOUR MAJESTY LOADS OUR HOUSE FOR THOSE OF OLD 
AND THE LATE DIGNITIES HEAP'D UP TO THEM 
WE REST YOUR HERMITS 
WHERE'S THE THANE OF CAWDOR 
IF IT WERE DONE 
WHEN TIS DONE 
THEN TWERE WELL IT WERE DONE QUICKLY 
WAS THE HOPE DRUNK WHEREIN YOU DRESS'D YOURSELF 
HATH IT SLEPT SINCE 
AND WAKES IT NOW TO LOOK SO GREEN AND PALE 
AT WHAT IT DID SO FREELY 
I HAVE GIVEN SUCK 
AND KNOW 
HOW TENDER TIS TO LOVE THE BABE THAT MILKS ME 
I WOULD WHILE IT WAS SMILING IN MY FACE 
HAVE PLUCK'D MY NIPPLE FROM HIS BONELESS GUMS 
AND DASH'D THE BRAINS OUT 
HAD I SO SWORN AS YOU HAVE DONE TO THIS 
WILL IT NOT BE RECEIVED 
WHEN WE HAVE MARK'D WITH BLOOD THOSE SLEEPY TWO 
OF HIS OWN CHAMBER AND USED THEIR VERY DAGGERS 
THAT THEY HAVE DONE'T 
WHO DARES RECEIVE IT OTHER 
AS WE SHALL MAKE OUR GRIEFS AND CLAMOUR ROAR 
UPON HIS DEATH 
I AM SETTLED AND BEND UP 
EACH CORPORAL AGENT TO THIS TERRIBLE FEAT 
AWAY AND MOCK THE TIME WITH FAIREST SHOW 
EACH OF THESE HAS A DRAMATIC EFFECT 
THAT MEANS THAT EACH OF THEM MARKS A CHANGE IN THE TONE OF THE SCENE 
AND THIS WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE AUDIENCE 
IF WE DREW A MAP OF THE DIFFERENT TONES OF 
LANGUAGE THROUGH THE SCENES IT MIGHT LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
IN ACT ONE SCENE SIX WHEN LADY MACBETH GREETS THE KING 
SHE'S COURTEOUS DETERMINED FORMAL AND HER SPEECH IS EXAGGERATED 
AT THE START OF ACT ONE SCENE SEVEN MACBETH IS TORTURED 
WHISPERS HIS THOUGHTS ALOUD AND SEEMS CONFUSED 
LADY MACBETH'S TONE SNEERING AGGRESSIVE URGENT CHANGES TO 
ENCOURAGING AND REASSURING 
THE SCENE ENDS WITH MACBETH DETERMINED AND POSITIVE ABOUT 
THE PLAN TO MURDER DUNCAN 
SAYING HOW A WRITER ACHIEVES AN EFFECT 
IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT QUESTIONS TO ANSWER 
WHAT YOU NEED TO LOOK FOR 
IS HOW A WRITER ACHIEVES AN EFFECT ON THE AUDIENCE 
THIS COMES FROM THE RHYTHM OF THE VERSE AND THE CHOICE OF LANGUAGE 
WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN 
LET'S GET SOME EXPERT ADVICE 
IN THIS SCENE LADY MACBETH IS REALLY TRYING TO 
GET ACROSS TO DUNCAN 
HOW PLEASED SHE IS TO HAVE HIM IN HER HOME 
HE'S HER GUEST AND SHE'S TRYING 
TO COMMUNICATE THAT 
IN QUITE AN EXAGGERATED WAY 
SO SHE'S USING FLOWING 
MEANDERING SENTENCES IN THIS PASSAGE 
WHICH ALMOST ENTRAP DUNCAN 
AND MAKE HIM FEEL SAFE 
SHE'S USING LANGUAGE 
TO BRING HIM INTO THE HOME 
AND HE HAS NO IDEA WHY 
IF YOU ALSO LOOK AT THE IMAGERY 
WHICH THE WORDS CONJURE 
IT'S AN INTERESTING PIECE 
BECAUSE SHE USES PHRASES 
LIKE TWICE DONE DONE DOUBLE 
HONOURS DEEP AND BROAD 
LOADS OUR HOUSE 
DIGNITIES HEAP'D UPON THEM 
IT'S AN EXAGGERATED 
EXPRESSION OF THANKS 
BUT IT'S ALSO A QUITE VISUAL USE 
OF LANGUAGE WHICH AGAIN 
SERVES A DOUBLE FUNCTION THERE 
IN THIS PASSAGE THE LANGUAGE IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
IT'S MACBETH TORTURED 
BY THE THOUGHT OF KILLING THE KING 
HE'S ANTICIPATING THIS MOMENT 
HE'S BEEN ASKED AND ENCOURAGED TO 
DO IT AND HE CAN'T QUITE GET 
HIS HEAD ROUND WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN 
HE KNOWS THAT THE KING IS HIS GUEST 
HE KNOWS THAT HE'S NOT A MURDERER 
HE IS DESCRIBED BY HIS WIFE EARLY ON 
AS HAVING THE MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS 
AND YET WITHIN THIS PASSAGE HE HAS 
TO CONVINCE HIMSELF IN HIS OWN MIND 
TO ACCOMPLISH THIS DEED 
SO HE REPEATS CERTAIN PHRASES AGAIN AND AGAIN 
THE LANGUAGE LOOPS ROUND ON ITSELF 
IN A WAY WHICH HE ACKNOWLEDGES 
EVEN WITHIN THE LANGUAGE OF THE PASSAGE 
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU'RE ASLEEP 
AND WORDS KEEP COMING BACK TO YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN 
AND AS THE PASSAGE DEVELOPS 
HE TALKS HIMSELF THROUGH 
REPEATING THE WORD DONE 
SO THAT HE CAN FOCUS ON WHAT 
IT WOULD BE WHEN THE KING IS DEAD 
RATHER THAN ON THE MOMENTS TO COME 
WHEREIN HE MUST KILL THE KING 
IN THIS SCENE LADY MACBETH 
NEEDS TO CONVINCE MACBETH 
TO CHANGE HIS MIND 
AND SHE NEEDS HIM TO DO THAT 
VERY QUICKLY FASTER THAN 
HE WOULD NORMALLY DO HIMSELF 
SO HER RHETORICAL STRATEGY IS 
TO USE A WHOLE SERIES OF QUESTIONS 
SHE ASKS A QUESTION 
AND SHE ASKS ANOTHER QUESTION 
THERE'S NO TIME FOR HIM TO PAUSE 
AND THINK IN BETWEEN 
SO THAT THE RHYTHM OF THE LANGUAGE 
BUILDS AND BUILDS 
AND HIS MIND BEGINS TO TAKE LEAPS 
THAT HE WOULDN'T WANT TO TAKE NORMALLY 
WITHIN THAT SHE PUTS A QUITE SHARP 
DIRECT STATEMENT ABOUT HER LOVE FOR 
HIM WHICH CAUSES HIM TO DRAW BACK 
AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION 
AN EVEN STRONGER ONE 
SO AT ONE LEVEL THE USE OF LANGUAGE 
AND THE USE OF QUESTIONS 
DRAWS HIM ON AND ON FURTHER AND FURTHER 
BUT AT ANOTHER LEVEL IT ALLOWS THE SPEECH TO BE QUITE EMOTIONAL BECAUSE 
USUALLY IN ASKING QUESTIONS WE GET DIRECTLY TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER 
WAS THE HOPE DRUNK WHEREIN YOU DRESS'D YOURSELF 
HATH IT SLEPT SINCE 
AND WAKES IT NOW TO LOOK SO GREEN AND PALE 
AT WHAT IT DID SO FREELY 
WOULDST THOU HAVE THAT 
WHICH THOU ESTEEM'ST THE ORNAMENT OF LIFE 
AND LIVE A COWARD IN THINE OWN ESTEEM 
LETTING I DARE NOT WAIT UPON I WOULD 
LIKE THE POOR CAT I. THE ADAGE 
PRITHEE PEACE 
I HAVE GIVEN SUCK AND KNOW 
HOW TENDER TIS TO LOVE THE BABE THAT MILKS ME 
I WOULD WHILE IT WAS SMILING IN MY FACE 
HAVE PLUCK'D MY NIPPLE FROM HIS BONELESS GUMS 
AND DASH'D THE BRAINS OUT HAD I SO SWORN AS YOU 
HAVE DONE TO THIS 
IF WE SHOULD FAIL WE FAIL 
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE MOST HARROWING 
OR THE MOST EMOTIONALLY MANIPULATIVE 
AND FORCEFUL MOMENT IN THE PLAY 
IT'S WHERE LADY MACBETH MAKES 
A HUGE LEAP THROUGH LANGUAGE 
SHE BEGINS WITH THESE TENDER 
NURTURING PHRASES ABOUT GIVING 
SUCK AND TAKING CARE EFFECTIVELY 
OF A SMALL CHILD AND THEN MAKES A 
HUGE LEAP TO DISCUSSING THE BASHING 
OF THIS CHILD'S BRAINS OUT 
SHE GOES FROM BEING THE NURTURING MOTHER 
TO THE SORT OF MALE LIKE WARRIOR 
AND IN MAKING THAT LEAP THROUGH LANGUAGE 
WHAT SHE DOES IS CAUSE BOTH MACBETH 
BUT ALSO THE READER TO SIT UP SUDDENLY 
AND TO THINK WHERE DID THAT COME FROM 
THAT KIND OF SHOCK TACTIC 
HAS AN EMOTIONAL AND ALSO A DRAMATIC 
IMPACT IN THE PIECE 
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT SHAKESPEARE'S LANGUAGE 
FIND THE CHANGES IN TONE AND RHYTHM 
TRY DRAWING A MAP OF THE SCENE SHOWING HOW THE TONE CHANGES 
AS THE SCENE PROGRESSES 
ALSO LOOK FOR THE CHOICE OF WORDS 
AND THE USE OF LANGUAGE 
WHEN YOU ARE ASKED TO COMMENT ON SHAKESPEARE'S LANGUAGE TRY 
TO THINK ABOUT THE TONE OF VOICE THE CHARACTERS WOULD BE USING ON STAGE 
REMEMBER THE PLAY IS TO BE PERFORMED 
THE WORDS THAT YOU ARE READING WILL HAVE BEEN SAID BY A CHARACTER 
ON STAGE SO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE CHARACTER IS THINKING AND FEELING 
AT A PARTICULAR MOMENT IN TIME AND THEREFORE HOW THE WORDS WILL BE USED 
TO CONVEY THAT SENSE OF MEANING THAT SENSE OF FEELING THE STRENGTH 
OF ANGER OR CONCERN OR AFFECTION OR LOVE OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE 
IN THE SHAKESPEARE PAPER YOU CAN'T PREDICT EXACTLY 
WHAT THE QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE 
THERE ARE CERTAIN TYPES HOWEVER AND IT'S GOOD TO PRACTISE THESE 
REMEMBER QUESTIONS MAY BE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS AND THEIR MOTIVATION 
OR ABOUT THE EFFECTS THE SCENE MAY HAVE ON AN AUDIENCE THROUGH THE WAY 
IT'S DIRECTED OR STAGED 
OR ABOUT IDEAS AND ISSUES WITHIN THE SECTION STUDIED 
OR ABOUT THE WAY SHAKESPEARE USES LANGUAGE 
AND REMEMBER YOU WILL HAVE TO REFER 
TO BOTH EXTRACTS FROM THE PLAY 
GIVEN ON YOUR QUESTION PAPER 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT CHARACTER 
THIS ONE'S FROM THE TEMPEST 
THIS ONE'S FROM MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING 
AND HERE'S AN EXAMPLE FROM RICHARD THE THIRD 
TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS 
YOU NEED TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF CHARACTER AND MOTIVATION 
A QUESTION COULD ALSO ASK YOU ABOUT HOW SHAKESPEARE USES LANGUAGE 
SO IN THE TEMPEST THIS COULD BE 
ANOTHER TYPE OF QUESTION MIGHT BE BASED ON AN EXPLORATION OF 
A THEME OR A NUMBER OF THEMES 
THIS ONE'S FROM MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING 
FINALLY THERE'S ALSO THE QUESTION THAT ASKS YOU 
TO EXPLORE THE TEXT IN PERFORMANCE 
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE FROM RICHARD THE THIRD 
THESE ARE JUST EXAMPLES 
YOU CAN USE THEM FOR PRACTICE AND REVISION SO THAT YOU'RE CONFIDENT 
THAT YOU KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT COULD BE ASKED 
REMEMBER YOU'LL HAVE TO REFER TO BOTH EXTRACTS FROM THE PLAY 
IT'S EASY TO MAKE MISTAKES IN THE SHAKESPEARE TEST SO HERE ARE SOME THINGS TO AVOID 
DON'T JUST REFER TO ONE EXTRACT 
REMEMBER YOU'RE STUDYING TWO 
KEEP TO THE SCENES YOU'RE STUDYING 
AND AVOID REFERRING TO THE WHOLE PLAY 
DON'T BE TOO GENERAL 
ANCHOR YOUR ANSWER IN THE TEXT BY USING QUOTATIONS 
THESE CAN BE SHORT PHRASES OR EVEN A KEY WORD 
DON'T OVERUSE QUOTATIONS OR COPY SECTIONS WHICH ARE TOO LONG 
AND DON'T JUST DESCRIBE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE EXTRACTS 
THE EXAMINER DOESN'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR VERSION 
WE'RE GOING TO START BY LOOKING AT A CHARACTER AND MOTIVATION QUESTION 
THE BEST WAY TO PREPARE FOR THIS IS TO MAKE A MAP OF THE POINTS 
WHERE A CHARACTER'S THOUGHTS WOULD CHANGE AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOUR THOUGHT MAP IS CLEAR 
WE'RE GOING TO RUN THROUGH POINTS ABOUT LADY MACBETH 
HAVE A PEN AND PAPER READY TO JOT DOWN YOUR OWN IDEAS 
THIS IS WHAT SHE SAYS AT DIFFERENT POINTS THROUGH THE SCENE 
ALL OUR SERVICE 
IN EVERY POINT TWICE DONE AND THEN DONE DOUBLE 
WERE POOR AND SINGLE BUSINESS TO CONTEND 
AGAINST THOSE HONOURS DEEP AND BROAD 
WHEREWITH YOUR MAJESTY LOADS OUR HOUSE 
WAS THE HOPE DRUNK WHEREIN YOU DRESSED YOURSELF 
HATH IT SLEPT SINCE 
I HAVE GIVEN SUCK AND KNOW HOW TENDER TIS 
TO LOVE THE BABE THAT MILKS ME 
I WOULD WHILE IT WAS SMILING IN MY FACE 
HAVE PLUCKED MY NIPPLE FROM HIS BONELESS GUMS 
AND DASHED THE BRAINS OUT 
IF WE SHOULD FAIL 
WE FAIL 
BUT SCREW YOUR COURAGE TO THE STICKING PLACE 
AND WE'LL NOT FAIL 
WHO DARES RECEIVE IT OTHER 
AS WE SHALL MAKE OUR GRIEFS AND CLAMOUR ROAR 
UPON HIS DEATH 
I AM SETTLED 
ARE YOU MAD LOSE OUR CHANCE LIKE THIS 
HE'S WEAKENING 
I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING QUICKLY TO CHANGE HIS MIND 
THAT'S IT WE CAN DO IT WE'RE STRONG TOGETHER 
WE'VE PLANNED THIS TOGETHER 
FAILING IS THE LEAST OF OUR WORRIES 
AT LAST THIS IS IT 
WE'RE GOING THROUGH WITH IT IT'S WHAT WE DESERVE 
WERE YOUR THOUGHTS SIMILAR TO OURS 
MAYBE NOT EXACTLY THE SAME BUT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE YOUR OWN VIEW 
AND THE EVIDENCE THE QUOTATIONS TO BACK IT UP THEN THAT'S FINE 
TRY NOT TO BE TOO GENERAL 
FOCUS ON THE KEY LINES WHICH EXPLAIN HOW A CHARACTER IS CHANGING 
OR WHEN YOU LEARN SOMETHING NEW ABOUT THE PERSON 
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW THE CHARACTER DEVELOPS 
THROUGH THE SCENE 
THE NEXT TYPE OF QUESTION IS ALL ABOUT HOW YOU MIGHT DIRECT 
A SCENE TO BRING OUT THE DRAMATIC EFFECT OF THE LANGUAGE 
TO ANSWER A QUESTION ABOUT DIRECTING OR STAGING A SCENE YOU NEED 
TO GET INTO THE MINDS OF THE CHARACTERS IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY 
BUT THIS TIME YOU NEED TO DECIDE HOW IT WILL LOOK 
YOU NEED TO THINK PHYSICAL 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN DOING THIS QUESTION WRITE WHAT THE CHARACTER 
IS FEELING RATHER THAN HOW AN AUDIENCE WOULD ACTUALLY SEE THAT CHARACTER 
SO IF MACBETH IS FEELING DOUBTFUL 
AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE 
WHAT WOULD HIS POSITION BE IN RELATION TO LADY MACBETH 
IF FOR EXAMPLE HE'S FEELING THREATENED 
IT'S THE PHYSICAL MOVEMENT 
AS WELL AS THE SPEAKING OF LINES WHICH HAS AN EFFECT ON AN AUDIENCE 
BODY LANGUAGE IS JUST AS POWERFUL 
IN EXPRESSING YOUR MEANING AS THE WORDS YOU SPEAK 
UNLIKE MOST MODERN PLAYWRIGHTS SHAKESPEARE DIDN'T INCLUDE 
MANY STAGE DIRECTIONS APART FROM ENTRANCES AND EXITS 
SO YOU AS A DIRECTOR HAVE TO DO THE JOB YOURSELF 
IDENTIFY CERTAIN LINES OR PASSAGES 
WHICH YOU GENUINELY COULD DIRECT IN DIFFERENT WAYS 
DEPENDING ON YOUR READING OF THE CHARACTER AT THAT POINT 
A DIRECTOR ALSO HAS TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO STAGE THE PLAY 
THE SETTING AND COSTUME 
A SHAKESPEARE PLAY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ACTED IN ITS ORIGINAL SETTING 
THE CHARACTERS COULD HAVE THE SAME FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS 
IN DIFFERENT TIMES AND PLACES 
THE DIRECTOR OF THIS DRAMATISATION HAS CHOSEN A FUTURISTIC SETTING 
BECAUSE HE FEELS IT WOULD BE RIGHT FOR THE CONFLICTS IN MACBETH 
WE'RE NOT SETTING OUT VERSION IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
WE'VE IMAGINED ANOTHER WORLD THAT'S JUST AS RUTHLESS 
JUST AS BRUTAL BUT FUTURISTIC SET MAYBE FIFTY YEARS FROM NOW 
YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THERE'S BEEN SOME KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER 
OR GLOBAL WAR IT DOESN'T MATTER 
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THE TYPE OF SOCIETY THAT'S LEFT 
SPLINTERED TRIBAL AND DANGEROUS 
MEN LIKE DUNCAN AND MACBETH WOULD HAVE BEEN WARLORDS OR ROBBER BARONS 
LADY MACBETH WOULD HAVE STATUS 
SHE'D HAVE WEALTH RESPECT 
SHE'D WEAR GLAMOROUS DAZZLING CLOTHES TO REFLECT HER POSITION 
BUT THEY'D LIVE IN A WORLD OF DECAY 
THEY'D USE OLD DISUSED FACTORIES FOR SHELTER THE MACHINERY LONG BROKEN 
THEY'D ARM THEM OUT TO THE HILT TO MAKE THEM SAFE 
MAYBE DECK OUT ONE AREA WITH PILLAGED LUXURIES 
AND IT'S HERE DUNCAN'S FEAST IS TAKING PLACE 
WHEN YOU ARE PREPARING FOR THE DIRECTION QUESTION 
FOCUS ON SHORT SECTIONS OF TEXT 
TRY TO IDENTIFY KEY LINES 
AND THINK ABOUT HOW YOU MIGHT DIRECT THEM IN DIFFERENT WAYS 
TRY TO VISUALISE THE SETTING TOO 
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ON THE STAGE TO MAKE THE SCENE WORK 
WE'VE COME TO THE END OF THIS SECTION ON SHAKESPEARE 
YOU CAN PLAY IT BACK AS MANY TIMES AS YOU LIKE 
UNTIL YOU FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT IT 
TAKE A BREAK HERE OR IF YOU PREFER 
MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SECTION ON DEVELOPING WRITING SKILLS 
THIS SECTION WILL HELP YOU WITH YOUR PUNCTUATION 
WHICH IS ESSENTIAL IF YOU ARE GOING TO COMMUNICATE YOUR IDEAS CLEARLY 
LET'S START WITH SPEECH MARKS 
YOU NEED TO USE SPEECH MARKS 
WHEN YOU HAVE A PERSON SPEAKING OF THINKING IN YOUR WRITING 
SPEECH MARKS LOOK LIKE THIS AND ALWAYS COME IN PAIRS 
ONE JUST BEFORE AND ONE JUST AFTER 
THE WORDS THAT ARE SPOKEN OR THOUGHT 
TO WORK OUT WHICH WORDS SHOULD GO IN SPEECH MARKS 
TRY HEARING OR SPEAKING YOUR WORDS ALOUD IN YOUR HEAD 
DUCK 
EVERY TIME YOU WRITE THE ACTUAL WORD SOMEONE SAYS 
YOU NEED TO USE SPEECH MARKS BEFORE AND AFTER THE WORDS THAT ARE SPOKEN 
THE SPOKEN BIT ALWAYS STARTS WITH A CAPITAL LETTER 
EVEN IF IT ISN'T AT THE END OF THE SENTENCE 
SPEECH ALWAYS ENDS WITH PUNCTUATION BEFORE THE CLOSING SPEECH MARKS 
WHAT 
IF THE SENTENCE CONTINUES AFTER THE SPEECH 
PUT A COMMA BEFORE THE CLOSING SPEECH MARKS 
DON'T JUST WRITE SAID ALL THE TIME 
TRY DIFFERENT VERBS TO DESCRIBE HOW SOMEBODY IS SPEAKING 
AND IF THE SPEECH IS A QUESTION PUT IN A QUESTION MARK 
DUCK 
IF THE SPEECH IS A COMMAND OR SHOWS STRONG FEELINGS 
USE AN EXCLAMATION MARK 
OUCH 
IN THIS EXTRACT THERE ARE TWO CHARACTERS WHO SPEAK 
AND A NARRATOR 
PUT SPEECH MARKS AROUND THE WORDS THAT ARE SAID OR THOUGHT 
BY THE CHARACTERS NOT THE NARRATOR 
TWO MONTHS YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS 
YOU'RE GOING ON A COMPUTER COURSE FOR TWO MONTHS 
IT'S ONLY THREE EVENINGS A WEEK 
SHE WALKED ON DOWN THE SCHOOL DRIVE AVOIDING DEBBIE'S EYES GREAT 
DEBBIE SAID SARCASTICALLY ONLY THREE EVENINGS OF BORING OLD COMPUTING 
YOU'LL HAVE A BIT OF TIME LEFT OVER FOR ME THEN 
OH DON'T BE SILLY MIRIAM WAS IMPATIENT BUT NOT WITH DEBBIE 
IT WAS THE KEEPING OF THE SECRET THAT ANNOYED HER 
THIS FIRST BIT IS WHAT DEBBIE SAYS 
TWO MONTHS YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS 
YOU'RE GOING ON A COMPUTER COURSE FOR TWO MONTHS 
BUT THE NEXT BIT IT'S ONLY THREE EVENINGS A WEEK 
IS WHAT MIRIAM SAYS SO EACH SPEECH NEEDS ITS OWN SET OF SPEECH MARKS 
AROUND DEBBIE'S SPEECH 
AND MIRIAM'S SPEECH 
FOR EACH SPEAKER YOU NEED TO HAVE A NEW LINE WHEN THE SPEAKER CHANGES 
SO YOU'D HAVE A NEW LINE BETWEEN THE TWO SPEECHES 
THE NEXT BIT IS NARRATION 
MIRIAM WALKED DOWN THE SCHOOL DRIVE AVOIDING DEBBIE'S EYES 
SO YOU DON'T NEED SPEECH MARKS BUT YOU DO NEED TO START A NEW LINE 
BEFORE MIRIAM WALKED 
DEBBIE'S REPLY OH GREAT ONLY THREE EVENINGS OF BORING OLD COMPUTING 
YOU'LL HAVE A BIT OF TIME LEFT OVER FOR ME THEN 
IS ALL ONE SENTENCE BUT IT'S SPLIT WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF HOW SHE SPEAKS 
DEBBIE SAID SARCASTICALLY 
ONCE AGAIN YOU START A NEW LINE WHEN DEBBIE STARTS SPEAKING 
AND THEN YOU JUST PUT THE WORDS SHE SAYS INTO SPEECH MARKS 
YOU DON'T NEED A CAPITAL LETTER FOR ONLY 
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE START OF A SPOKEN SENTENCE 
AND THAT'S WHAT THE FINISHED TEXT 
LOOKS LIKE WITH SPOKEN WORDS IN SPEECH MARKS 
AND EACH TIME THE SPEAKER CHANGES 
OR THERE'S A NARRATION WE START A NEW LINE 
SPEECH MARKS GO ROUND THE WORDS THAT ARE ACTUALLY THOUGHT OR SPOKEN 
BY THE PEOPLE IN YOUR WRITING 
EACH NEW SPEAKER MUST START A NEW LINE 
APPLY THE NORMAL RULES OF PUNCTUATION TO THE SPOKEN SENTENCE 
EVEN IF IT'S SPLIT UP 
NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO APOSTROPHES 
APOSTROPHES ARE IMPORTANT IN WRITING 
AND IF YOU GET THEM WRONG YOU CAN END UP NOT SAYING WHAT YOU INTENDED 
THE PROBLEM IS APOSTROPHES DO TWO DIFFERENT JOBS 
THEY SHOW WHERE YOU HAVE REDUCED TWO WORDS TO ONE KNOWN AS ABBREVIATION 
AND THEY ALSO SHOW POSSESSION 
AN ABBREVIATION IS WHEN WORDS ARE SHORTENED 
BY MISSING OUT SOME LETTERS 
WE USE THEM A LOT WHEN WE SPEAK 
AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE THEM WHEN YOU'RE WRITING INFORMALLY 
THESE ARE WORDS LIKE 
I'M IT'S WASN'T AND IT'LL 
THEY'RE ALL WORDS THAT HAVE BEEN ABBREVIATED OR COMPRESSED INTO ONE 
LET'S LOOK AT THE WORDS THEY STARTED OUT AS 
I'M COMES FROM I AM 
IT'S FROM IT IS 
WASN'T FROM WAS NOT 
AND IT'LL FROM IT WILL 
SO THE APOSTROPHE GOES WHERE THE LETTERS ARE MISSING 
WHY NOT STOP THE PROGRAMME AND THINK OF SOME MORE ABBREVIATIONS 
WORK OUT WHICH LETTERS ARE MISSING AND WHERE THE APOSTROPHE GOES 
THE OTHER TIME WE USE APOSTROPHES IS TO SHOW POSSESSION OR OWNERSHIP 
TO SHOW THAT SOMETHING BELONGS TO SOMEONE OR SOMETHING 
INSTEAD OF SAYING LOOK AT THE DOG BELONGING TO NICKI 
YOU CAN SAY LOOK AT NICKI'S DOG 
WITH AN S. AFTER NICKI TO SHOW THAT NICKI OWNS THE DOG 
NEIL OWNS THE PEN 
BECOMES NEIL'S PEN 
AND THE DOG OWNS THE BONE 
BECOMES THE DOG'S BONE 
NOW WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU WANT TO ADD A POSSESSIVE APOSTROPHE 
TO A WORD THAT ALREADY ENDS IN S. LIKE A PLURAL OR A NAME LIKE CHRIS 
LET'S GO BACK TO THAT DOG AND ITS BONE 
WHAT IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE DOG WHO ALL HAVE SHARES IN THE BONE 
SO ALL THE DOGS OWN THE BONE 
IF WE WERE TO ADD S. IN THE USUAL WAY 
YOU WOULD GET DOGS'S WHICH LOOKS SILLY 
SO WE DROP THE FINAL S. AND THE WORD ENDS S. 
THE SAME APPLIES WITH A NAME LIKE CHRIS 
SO CHRIS'S VIDEO GAME ENDS S. 
NOW PRONOUNS DON'T HAVE APOSTROPHES 
THIS MEANS YOU DON'T ADD S. TO THE FOLLOWING WORDS 
YOU CHANGE THE ACTUAL WORD 
SO I BECOMES MY 
OR MINE 
YOU BECOMES YOUR 
OR YOURS 
HE BECOMES HIS 
SHE BECOMES HER 
OR HERS 
IT BECOMES ITS WITHOUT THE APOSTROPHE 
WE BECOMES OUR 
OR OURS 
AND THEY BECOMES THEIR 
OR THEIRS 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO GET APOSTROPHES RIGHT 
BECAUSE ITS AND IT'S MAY SOUND THE SAME 
BUT IT'S WITH AN APOSTROPHE IS JUST AN ABBREVIATION OF IT IS 
AND ITS IS A POSSESSIVE FORM 
AND IF THE EXAMINER PICKS UP ON THAT YOU WILL LOSE MARKS 
TAKE CARE WHEN YOU'RE USING APOSTROPHES 
REMEMBER THAT AN APOSTROPHE IS USED TO SHOW THAT A LETTER 
HAS BEEN MISSED OUT 
OR TO SHOW POSSESSION THAT SOMEONE OWNS SOMETHING 
TOO OFTEN IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL YOU FIND YOURSELF 
THROWING IN APOSTROPHES EVERY TIME YOU USE THE LETTER S. 
AND THAT'S NOT CORRECT 
MAKE SURE YOU DO UNDERSTAND RULES ABOUT USING THE APOSTROPHE 
APOSTROPHES ARE USED FOR ABBREVIATION 
WHEN YOU REDUCE TWO WORDS INTO ONE AND LETTERS HAVE BEEN MISSED OUT 
APOSTROPHES ARE ALSO USED TO SHOW POSSESSION 
YOU PUT S. ON THE END OF A NOUN TO SHOW IT OWNS SOMETHING 
IF THE NOUN IS PLURAL YOU LEAVE OFF THE SECOND S. 
BECAUSE IT LOOKS SILLY 
YOU ALSO LEAVE OFF THE SECOND S. WHEN A NAME ENDS IN S. 
FINALLY DON'T CONFUSE ITS BELONGING TO IT 
AND IT'S WITH S. WHICH IS SHORT FOR IT IS 
IN THIS SECTION WE LOOKED AT SPEECH MARKS AND APOSTROPHES 
BOTH OF WHICH YOU MUST USE IF YOUR WRITING IS TO MAKE SENSE 
BUT THERE ARE OTHER PUNCTUATION MARKS YOU CAN USE TO GET EXTRA MARKS 
DON'T FORGET SEMICOLONS ELLIPSIS 
HYPHENS AND QUESTION MARKS 
ALL OF THESE ARE LIKE THE ICING ON THE CAKE 
NOT ONLY WILL THEY DRESS UP YOUR WRITING 
BUT THEY WILL ALSO ADD MORE MEANING SO THAT YOUR WORK IS REALLY CRAFTED 
SPELLING IS IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOU TO COMMUNICATE YOUR IDEAS CLEARLY TO YOUR READER 
AS WELL AS THAT YOUR SPELLING IS GIVEN A SPECIFIC MARK OUT OF FOUR 
IN THE SHORTER WRITING TASK 
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT SOME WAYS YOU CAN LEARN TO SPELL WORDS CORRECTLY 
LET'S START BY CHECKING OUT HOW 
WE SPELL PLURAL WORDS THAT'S WHEN THERE'S MORE THAN ONE OF SOMETHING 
TO MAKE MOST WORDS PLURAL YOU ADD AN S. TO THE END OF THE WORD 
DOG BECOMES DOGS 
ONTO PREFIXES AND SUFFIXES 
THE S. AND ES YOU ADD TO A WORD TO MAKE IT PLURAL IS A SUFFIX 
THE WORD ENDINGS ED ING AND ABLE 
ARE ALSO SUFFIXES 
TO SPELL MOST WORDS WITH A SUFFIX USE THE ROOT WORD PLUS THE SUFFIX 
BUT SUFFIXES DON'T ALWAYS 
STICKS STRAIGHT ON TO THE END OF THEIR ROOT WORD 
THEY SOMETIMES CHANGE THE END OF THE WORD THEY'RE JOINING SO YOU HAVE TO 
KNOW A FEW MORE RULES OVER TO OUR EXPERT 
IF THE ROOT WORD ENDS IN E. LIKE ARGUE AND THE SUFFIX STARTS 
WITH A VOWEL YOU DROP THE E. BEFORE ADDING THE SUFFIX SO YOU GET 
ARGUED 
AND ARGUING 
THESE WORDS DROP AND LOOK BOTH END IN A CONSONANT 
DROP HAS A SHORT VOWEL SOUND 
O. SO YOU DOUBLE THE CONSONANT 
DROPPED 
AND DROPPING 
LOOK HAS A LONG VOWEL SOUND 
OOH SO WE KEEP THE SINGLE CONSONANT AND ADD THE SUFFIX TO GET 
LOOKED AND LOOKING 
WE'RE GOING TO ADD THE PREFIX DIS TO APPOINT APPEAR AND SATISFIED 
AND WE GET 
KEEPING THE TWO S.'S IN DISSATISFIED 
THE SAME APPLIES WHEN YOU ADD THE PREFIX UN TO NECESSARY 
YOU GET UNNECESSARY WITH A DOUBLE N. 
BECAUSE YOU ARE JUST JOINING THE PARTS OF THE WORD TOGETHER 
MARKERS COMMENT ON THE NUMBER OF SPELLING MISTAKES THAT PUPILS MAKE 
AND LET ME GIVE YOU A TIP TAKE A BIT OF TIME BEFORE THE TEST 
TO LEARN A FEW BASIC SPELLING RULES PARTICULARLY RULES ABOUT HOW TO PUT 
ENDINGS ON VERBS ED ENDINGS ING ENDINGS 
MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU SHOULD DOUBLE THE CONSONANT 
AT THE END OF A VERB WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING THESE ENDINGS IN PLACE 
AND THEN YOU'LL MAKE FEWER MISTAKES 
ON THE OTHER HAND DON'T BE FRIGHTENED TO TRY 
FOR A MORE AMBITIOUS CHOICE OF WORD 
GO FOR THE AMBITIOUS VOCABULARY RATHER THAN BE FRIGHTENED OFF BECAUSE 
YOU THINK YOU CAN'T SPELL IT CORRECTLY 
PREFIXES ARE UNITS YOU ADD TO THE FRONT OF WORDS TO MAKE NEW WORDS 
SUFFIXES ARE UNITS YOU ADD TO THE END OF WORDS TO MAKE NEW WORDS 
IF A WORD ENDS IN E. AND THE SUFFIX STARTS WITH A VOWEL YOU DROP THE E. 
BEFORE ADDING THE SUFFIX 
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SHOW THE EXAMINER YOUR BEST WORK 
YOU NEED TO LEAVE FIVE MINUTES AT THE END OF THE TEST TO IMPROVE IT 
THIS IS REALLY WORTH IT BECAUSE IT COULD RAISE YOUR 
WORK BY A WHOLE LEVEL 
IT'S GOOD TO BUILD IN AT THE END OF THE EXAMINATION FIVE MINUTES 
TO GO BACK AND CHECK YOUR WORK 
I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND RANDOM CHECKING JUST GOING BACK 
AND CASTING YOUR EYES OVER IT 
MAKE BEST USE OF THAT FIVE MINUTES BY DECIDING IN ADVANCE 
WHAT ARE THE THINGS I REALLY NEED TO CHECK FOR 
IF YOU KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT CERTAIN SPELLING ERRORS THAT YOU'RE PRONE 
TO MAKE IF YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU ALWAYS MISS OUT LIKE 
APOSTROPHES HAVE IT IN YOUR MIND WHAT ARE THE THINGS YOU 
MUST GO BACK AND CHECK FOR AND MAKE BEST USE OF FIVE MINUTES 
WHEN YOU ARE CHECKING YOUR WORK DON'T WORRY ABOUT BEING PENALISED 
BECAUSE YOU'VE CORRECTED MISTAKES 
DO IT AS NEATLY AS YOU CAN PUT A LINE THROUGH THE MISTAKE 
AND WRITE OVER THE TOP THE CORRECT VERSION PUT IN PUNCTUATION 
INDICATE PARAGRAPH BREAKS WITH A COUPLE OF VERTICAL LINES AND A LITTLE 
NOTE IN THE MARGIN SAYING PARA 
THE MARKER WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND THERE IS NO PENALTY 
INVOLVED IN PUTTING IN CORRECTIONS 
WHEN I'M CHECKING MY WORK I GO THROUGH LOOKING FOR PARAGRAPHS 
AND SPELLING MISTAKES THEN GO THROUGH CORRECTING THE PUNCTUATION 
IN THE TEST I USED THE LAST FIVE MINUTES TO CHECK MY WORK 
AND I WAS REALLY SURPRISED BECAUSE I 
FOUND LOTS OF LITTLE MISTAKES THAT COULD HAVE LOST ME MARKS 
GRAMMAR PUNCTUATION APOSTROPHES SPELLING 
SMALL MISTAKES THAT I MISSED THE FIRST TIME ROUND 
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO CHECK FOR THEM 
SO YOU NEED TO CHECK YOUR WORK BY READING IT CAREFULLY 
TO BE SURE YOU'VE ACTUALLY WRITTEN WHAT YOU MEANT TO WRITE 
THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE WRITTEN TO BE SURE IT MAKES SENSE 
CORRECTING ANY MISTAKES LIKE SPELLINGS AND PUNCTUATION 
IMPROVING YOUR WORK IF YOU CAN BY CHANGING WORDS OR ADDING NEW BITS 
THIS IS ANOTHER STUDENT'S ANSWER 
IT WAS AWARDED LEVEL FOUR 
SO LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET IT TO LEVEL FIVE IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES 
LET'S START BY CORRECTING THE MISTAKES AND WE NEED TO LOOK 
AT SPELLING PUNCTUATION AND GRAMMAR 
DEAR CIARON 
YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON WHO MIGHT BELIEVE WHAT I AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU 
I ENTERED A COMPETITION WHERE YOU HAVE TO BE EIGHTEEN AND I WON 
THE PRIZE WAS FIFTY THOUSAND POUND AND TO MEAT RONALDO 
IN THIS SENTENCE WE DON'T NEED THE WORD POUND 
AND MEAT SHOULD BE SPELT M. E. E. T. 
WE CAN HAVE FULL STOP AFTER RONALDO AND START THE NEXT SENTENCE WITH 
A CAPITAL Y. ON YOU 
YOU HAD TO RING UP TO ENTER COMMA 
THAT IS HOW I GO AWAY WITH MY AGE 
I ENTERED AS A JOKE THINKING 
I WOULDN'T WIN' HERE WE NEED AN APOSTROPHE BETWEEN THE N. AND THE T. 
AND WE CAN HAVE A FULL STOP AFTER WIN' 
I HAVE TO GO TO THE AIRPORT AND GET THE PRIVATE JET COMMA 
THEN FLY TO ITALY TO MEET RONALDO AND PICK UP THE CHECK 
AND CHECK HERE SHOULD BE SPELT C. H. E. Q. U. E. 
THE BEST THING IS IT IS FOR TWO PEOPLE COMMA SO I WILL 
BE ABLE TO TAKE MY BROTHER WHO IS EIGHTEEN AND HE WILL BE ABLE TO GET IT FOR ME 
WHEN I TOLD HIM THOUGH COMMA HE SAID HE WANTED TEN THOUSAND FOR IT 
FULL STOP 
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE 
I HAD TO DO IT COMMA 
SO I DID HERE WE CAN HAVE FULL STOP 
START A NEW SENTENCE WITH A CAPITAL W. AND AN APOSTROPHE ON WE'RE 
WE'RE GOING ON TUESDAY 
COME ROUND ON FRIDAY TO MY HOUSE COMMA 
NO ONE ELSE MUST KNOW ABOUT WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU 
THE ENDING HERE IS TOO FORMAL SO WE DON'T NEED THE FAITHFULLY 
AND CAN JUST END IT YOURS BERNIE 
WHAT A DIFFERENCE 
IT REALLY IS WORTH SPENDING THE LAST FIVE MINUTES OF THE TEST CHECKING 
YOU CAN PRACTISE THIS ON ALL YOUR WRITTEN WORK 
THERE ARE TWO THINGS YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON 
WHEN IMPROVING YOUR WRITING 
ONE IS THE CORRECTIONS YOU NEED TO MAKE 
THE OTHER IS HOW YOU CAN IMPROVE THE VOCABULARY 
BY CHANGING WORDS FOR BETTER ONES AND IF THERE'S TIME CHECK TO MAKE 
SURE YOUR MEANING IS CLEAR 
TRY TO HEAR YOUR WORK ALOUD IN YOUR HEAD AND CHECK IT MAKES SENSE AND IS 
INTERESTING 
AND DON'T STOP WORKING UNTIL TIME IS UP AND YOU'RE TOLD TO STOP WRITING 
THIS IS THE END OF THIS SECTION ON DEVELOPING WRITING SKILLS AND 
THE END OF THIS REVISION PROGRAMME FOR YOUR KEY STAGE THREE ENGLISH TESTS 
FEEL FREE TO RE RUN ANY SECTIONS WHERE YOU NEED MORE HELP 
AND GOOD LUCK IN YOUR TESTS
