GOOD AFTERNOON HAPPY SAINT GEORGE'S 
DAY IT IS APPROPRIATE ON THIS DAY 
OF DAYS THAT WE HAVE AN ENGLISH MAN 
AGAINST A YOUNG CHINESE THE WELSH 
DRAGON BECAUSE RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
MAKES HIS OPENING BASLE IN THIS 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP IN SHEFFIELD 
THIS AFTERNOON AND HE DOES SO 
AGAINST THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD QUALIFIER 
YOU CHANG FROM CHINA ONE OF A 
RECORD FOUR CHINESE PLAYERS IN THE 
DRAW THIS YEAR TWO GOT AWAY LAST 
NIGHT AND THE OTHER TWO DO TODAY 
THERE ARE A LOT OF YOUNG CHINESE 
PLAYERS COMING THROUGH THE 
CRUCIBLE IS A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT FOR 
ANY PLAYER AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN 
CHINA HAS GOT A VERY BIG DEUCE 
ACADEMY SYSTEM THAT IS STARTING TO 
BRING SNOOKER INTEREST COOLS NOW 
YOUTH THE CHINESE SNOOKER 
ASSOCIATION HAVE NOW GOT FUNDING TO 
SEND HIGH ACHIEVING ONE'S OVER TO 
THE U. K. TO PLAYED IN THE ACADEMY IT IT WILL NOT BE MANY SEASONS BEFORE WE 
SEE FIVE CHINESE PLAYERS IN THE 
TOP 
SEE FIVE CHINESE PLAYERS IN THE TOP THIRTY TWO 
I AM ALMOST CERTAIN THAT BIT THE 
CHINESE PLAYERS CONTINUE TO 
PROGRESS THEY ARE GOING TO BE 
WANTING TO HAVE BIGGER TOURNAMENT 
IF THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP COULD 
EASILY MOVE TO CHINA THEY ARE 
PREPARED TO PAY THE REQUIRED AMOUNT 
IT IS GOOD AFTERNOON TO STEVE DAVIS 
I AM SURE THERE WERE PLENTY OF 
GROGGY CHINESE SNOOKER FANS IN 
BEIJING AND ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY 
THIS MORNING AFTER STAYING UP TO 
WATCH DING JUNHUI BEAT MARCO FU 
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES FOR THE OTHER 
TWO MAINLAND CHINESE PLAYERS TODAY 
THEY HAVE SPENT MOST OF THEIR 
CAREERS TO DATE IN THE QUALIFYING 
SECTORS OF THE EVENTS SO TO COME 
TO THE FIRST ROUND IS A JOURNEY 
INTO THE UNKNOWN MANY PLAYERS HAVE 
SUNK ON THEIR DEBUTS SOME PLAYERS 
HAVE SWUM SO YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW 
THEY WILL REACT 
THERE IS AN 
ASIATIC FLAVOUR TODAY FIVE AT 
SHEFFIELD

SENSATIONS COMING THROUGH AGAINST 
KEN DOHERTY HE WILL FIND IT VERY 
DIFFICULT 
I AM COMMENTATING ON DIFFICULT RONNIE O'SULLIVAN'S FIRST MATCH

CHINESE SENSATION AT LIU CHUANG

WAIT FOR THIS ONE 
GRAEME DOTT 
CONTEMPLATES THE FINALE OF HIS 
OPENING MATCH AGAINST JOE PERRY WE 
WILL SEE THAT SOON 
SHAUN MURPHY IS SEVEN TO TWO IN FRONT AND 
THE WORLD CHAMPION OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE IS 
SPORTING A SPARKLING NEW OUTFIT 
WHAT DOES SNOOKER MEAN TO A PROUD 
WELSHMAN LIKE HUW EDWARDS QUITE A 
LOT ACTUALLY 
SNOOKER FOR ME MEANS 
TENSION EXCITEMENT AT THE ARE 
SOMETIMES IF YOU FEAR THE PLAYERS 
ON THE SKIDS BUT ABOVE ALL IT 
MEANS HUGE ENJOYMENT 
IN THE GAP 
BETWEEN THE PLAQUE FORM AND THE 
EXIT AT SHEFFIELD STATION ARE TWO 
CRUCIBLE WINNER HAS TO ORIGIN TO 
IMPROVE PLATFORM 
LET US HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS 
TODAY WE HAVE GOT ALL THE FANS AND 
THE GENERAL PUBLIC BEEN WITH US 
AGAIN TODAY BUT WE ALSO HAVE A 
VERY SPECIAL GUEST WHO HAS NOT GOT 
HIS SNOOKER HAD BUT HIS RACING HAD 
ON TODAY WHAT IS ON YOUR AGENDA 
TODAY 
JOHN PARROTT ENJOYED WORKING TODAY WITH ME SO MUCH AT THE GRAND 
NATIONAL THAT HE HAS BEGGED TO WORK 
WITH ME TODAY FLAT RACING TODAY 
WHAT ARE YOU LIKE ON THE FLAT 
HOPEFULLY O. K. L. USED TO GO TO 
NOTTINGHAM TO SEE THE CHAMPIONS 
BUT I HAVE SEEN A FEW FLAT MEETINGS 
A GOOD FLAT AFFAIR OVAL 
WE OF FORTY FIVE 
DAYS AWAY FROM THE VODAFONE DERBY 
AT EPSOM AND THE COUNTDOWN BEGINS 
TODAY 
AT NOTTINGHAM 
THE B. B. C. HAVE 
NEVER BEEN TO NOTTINGHAM BEFORE 
THE RACECOURSE IS SITUATED IN 
CORPORATE PARK AND NOW HOSTS ONLY 
FLAT RACING BUT UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY SIX IT WAS 
DUAL PURPOSE AND THEY HELD BOTH 
FLAT AND JUMP RACING THREE DAY 
RAISES ARE TAKING PLACE ON GOOD TO 
SOFT GROUND THEY START AT TWO TWENTY P. M. 
AT THREE THIRTY P. M. IT IS OUR DERBY TRIAL 
TODAY THE INTERCASINOCO.UK OVER 
TEN FURLONGS AS A TWO YEAR OLD CURTAIN CALL WON 
THIS RACE IT PROPELLED HIM TO HIS 
CURRENT POSITION AS SECOND IN THE 
BETTING FOR THE DERBY THE HORSES 
ARE DOWN AT THE START FOR THE FIRST 
RACE WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THE 
RUNNERS AND RIDERS THE HORSES ARE ALREADY DOWN AT THE 
START BUT THE GOT THE CHANCE TO SEE 
SOME OF THEM AT THE PADDOCK NUMBER 
FOURTEEN PUY D'ARNAC HAS BEEN ON REAL 
ROLE HE HAS WON TWO OF HIS LAST 
THREE IT SHOULD BE THEORETICALLY 
MORE DIFFICULT FOR HIM TODAY THIS THIS IS DOUBLE BANDED HE MIGHT NOT HAVE 
STOPPED IMPROVING JUST YET POLISH POLISH RED IS FANCIED QUITE A BIT TODAY 
HE DOES HAVE A LONG LAY OFF TO 
OVERCOME HE HAS GOT TO DEFY A TWO HUNDRED SIXTY NINE 
DAY ABSENCE 
THIS IS INCHNADAMPH 
HE RESUMES ON AN EIGHT POUND HIGHER 
MARK THE GROUND IS NOT IDEAL FOR 
HIM USUALLY WINS RACES LATER IN 
THE SEASON 
KASTHARI NORMALLY MIX 
HIS BOAT JUMPING AND FLAT RACING 
BUT HE HAS NOT BEEN JUMPING THIS 
SEASON HE COMES HERE AFTER ANOTHER 
LONG LAY OFF 
MILLVILLE IS RENOWNED 
AS AN ALL WEATHER PERFORMER HE 
RETURNS ON A THREE POUND LOWER MARK 
HE HAS NEVER LOST ON THIS BEFORE 
THIS HORSE HAS NEVER BEEN LOST IN 
THE MARKET HE HAS JUST HAD THREE 
START HE HAS HAD TWO GOOD 
PERFORMANCES THIS SEASON BOTH ON 
THE ALL WEATHER THIS IS A TEST FOR 
HIM ON THE TURF TODAY YOUR 
SUGGESTION 
I FANCY THE FAVOURITE SUGGESTION PUY D'ARNAC I HAVE TO AGREE WITH JOHN LET'S 
JOIN JIM ACCRA WITH THE COMMENTARY 
AWAY TO GOOD START 
TILT WAS VERY QUICKLY INTO HIS 
STRIDE AND SAHRATI ON THE OUTSIDE 
ALSO CROSSING OVER HIS ODIHAM 
TAKING UP A PROMINENT POSITION HE 
FOLLOWS THE FAVOURITE PUY D'ARNAC 
FIFTH OR SIXTH FOLLOWED BY TILT AND 
MILLVILLE IS FURTHER BACK IN THE 
FIELD THEY SWING LEFT HANDED PAST 
THE STANDS INTO THE COUNTRY 
FOLLOWED IN BY LETS ROLL MAN OF 
GWENT IS BACK IN THE FIELD PASS 
THE PORT HIS LAST THREE PARTS AWAY 
THE DINNER IS DOUBLE BANDED TILT 
ON THE OUTSIDE INCHNADAMPH IS PRETTY WIDE FURTHER 
BACK MAN OF GWENT IS RIGHT ON THE 
RAILS THEY CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY 
OVER THE FAR SIDE OF THE COURSE NOW 
LESS THAN SEVEN FURLONGS TO TRAVEL 
BOWLING ALONG HERE IS TALENTI BY LENGTH MAN OF GWENT ON THE INSIDE IS 
INCLINED TO PULL LITTLE BIT PASS 
THE PORT HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT 
PROGRESS FOLLOWED BY SAHRATI AND 
LAST IS POLISH RED AS THEY SWEEP 
DOWN NOW THEY HAVE GOT FOUR AND A 
HALF FURLONGS LEFT TO TRAVEL 
ODIHAM ON THE OUTSIDE THEN DOUBLE 
BANDED IN THIRD FOLLOWED BY TILT 
THEY PASSED A HALF MILE FURTHER 
BACK MILLVILLE AND POLISH RED 
MAKING FAST MOVER MAN OF GWENT MAKING MOVE IT LETS ROLL HAS 
SHUFFLED BACK IT IS STILL TALENTI 
WITH TWO AND HALF TO GO ON THE 
OUTSIDE KASTHARI RIGHT DOWN THE 
OUTSIDE PAST PASS THE PORT NOW 
HE STARTS TO KICK CLEAR DOUBLE 
BANDED HAS GONE IN FRONT OF TALENTI 
PUY D'ARNAC CAN'T FIGHT ANY MORE 
HE IS GOING TO GO ON AND WIN THE 
FIRST TALENTI THIRD 
THE DOUBLE 
BANDIED HAS WON THE OPENER 
DOUBLE BANDED HE SEEMED TO HAVE 
SOME TROUBLE PROBLEMS BUT NOT 
ENOUGH TO PREVENT HIM TAKING THIS 
RACE A TYPICAL JOHN DUNLOP 
IMPROVEMENT TOWARDS THE END OF LAST 
SEASON AND DESPITE THE FACT HE 
PULLED A LITTLE BIT HARD RACED 
KEENLY IN THE EARLY POT OF THE RACE 
HE HAD ENOUGH ENERGY LATE ON YES YES HE TRAVELLED REALLY WELL HE CAN'T 
GET A CLEAR PASSAGE BUT IT MIGHT 
HAVE DONE A FAVOUR ONCE HE SAW 
DAYLIGHT IT WAS ALL OVER IN A 
MATTER OF STRIDES 
THE FAVOURITE 
PUY D'ARNAC WAS DISAPPOINTING A A LITTLE BIT TOO KEEN FOR HIS OWN 
GOOD HE TRAVELLED LITTLE WIDE FOR 
THE BEST POT OF THE RACE THERE IS 
NO DOUBT THE WINNER IS VERY GOOD 
NOT TOO MANY HORSES HAVE MADE UP A 
LOT OF GROUND BUT TILT CERTAINLY 
DID HE MADE UP QUITE BIT OF 
GROUND TO GRAB SECOND TALENTI WAS 
SETTING MODEST PACE THOUGHT HE 
RAN WELL 
HE RAN A PRETTY GOOD RACE 
HE WILL BE DISAPPOINTED GIVEN THE 
AMOUNT OF MONEY HE COST 
HE COST 
FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND GUINEAS AT THE SALES 
POSSIBLY THE NEW OWNERS MIGHT START 
RECOUPING SOME OF THIS CASH DOUBLE 
BANDED THE WINNER TILT SECOND NOT 
MUCH ELSE TO NOTE APART FROM PASS 
THE PORT KERRIN MCEVOY IT IS FROM 
AUSTRALIA HE WAS THE SECOND JOCKEY 
TO FRANKIE DETTORI BUT HOW WELL 
HAS HE DONE ABSOLUTELY 
WE WILL BE LOOKING ABSOLUTELY FORWARD TO SEEING MORE KERRIN 
MCEVOY IT AS THE SEASON PROGRESSES 
SADLY JOHN AND I STAND IT 
MANAGED TO STOP PUY D'ARNAC ON THE 
FIRST RACE NO LUCK FOR US PUY 
D'ARNAC OUT OF LUCK BUT THE NEXT 
RACE AT TWO FORTY FIVE P. M. THE TIP FOR THE 
FUTURE RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HE IS EIGHT 
ONE WITH ONE BOOKMAKER TO SCORE A 
MAXIMUM BREAK THAT MIGHT BE WORTH 
A POUND OR TWO 
NOT A BAD BET AND 
THAT WOULD BE THE THIRD OF HIS 
SEASON SO FAR HE HAS ALREADY MADE 
SOME MONEY FROM MAXIMUM BREAKS 
ANOTHER TWO RACES OVER THE NEXT 
HOUR UNTIL THE NEXT ONE WE WILL 
CONCENTRATE ON EVENTS IN THE 
CRUCIBLE THEATRE IT IS THE FIRST 
ROUND MATCH THAT WE WERE WATCHING 
YESTERDAY BETWEEN GRAEME DOTT AND 
JOE SWAIL JOE WILL JOE PERRY 
HE NEEDS TO TAKE HIS TIME IT HAS 
BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE HE HAS GOT 
IN THE BALLS THIS IS POT OF THE 
TEST IN THE CRUCIBLE YOU'RE GOING 
TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN YOUR 
CHAIR WITH THE QUALITY OF PLAYERS 
THAT YOU ARE UP AGAINST WHEN YOUR 
TURN COMES YOU HAVE GOT TO BE 
READY 
I THINK HE HAS COME A LITTLE ON THE 
STRAIGHTS SIDE BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE 
IF HE HAS GOT THE ANGLE TO RUN OFF 
TWO CUSHIONS THAT WAS EXCELLENT 
IT HAS BEEN A VERY GOOD SESSION OF 
SNOOKER WE HAVE HAD TWO CENTURIES 
AND LOTS OF GOOD SAFETY PLAY THE 
NORMAL ONE OR TWO ERRORS THROWN IN 
BETWEEN BUT IT HAS BEEN VERY 
ENTERTAINING 
HE HAS GOT ONE RED AT THE BOTTOM OF 
THE BUNCH 
IT IS AMAZING HOW MANY TIMES THESE 
PLAYERS COME STRAIGHT ALMOST 
STRAIGHT AND THAT RESTRICTS THEIR 
POSITION 
HE LOOKED IN PERFECT POSITION IN 
CONTROL OF THINGS 
A FEW MILLIMETRES OUT AND HE IS 
STARTING TO STRUGGLE WELL DONE 
THE POT WAS DIFFICULT ENOUGH FOR 
HIM TO HAVE PUT TOO MUCH ATTENTION 
INTO THE POTTING SIDE OF THE 
EQUATION AND NOT ENOUGH INTO THE 
POSITION SIDE THE BLUE IS 
AVAILABLE BUT I DON'T THINK HE CAN 
GET ON A RED OFF THIS BLUE UNLESS 
HE PLAYS THE DEEP SCREW WITH 
REVERSE SIDE OFF TWO CUSHIONS THAT IS VERY GOOD EXCELLENT SHOT 
HE GOT UP QUICK THEM HE THOUGHT HE 
HAD MISHIT THAT 
THIS HAS BEEN A VERY FINE EFFORT 
FROM PERRY 
THE POSITIONAL SHOT FROM BLUE 
RUNNING THROUGH BALL TO A RED ON 
THE SIDE CUSHION WAS THE KEY TO 
THIS TERRIFIC SHOT 
GRAEME DOTT'S BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX IN THE 
LAST FRAME IS ANSWERED EMPHATICALLY 
BY PERRY 
HE HIMSELF MAY MAKE A CENTURY IN 
REPLY 
JOE PERRY'S THIRD CENTURY OF THE 
MATCH 
NOW PARIS HAS THE CHANCE TO SET A 
TARGET FOR THE HIGHEST BREAK PRIZE 
JOE PERRY THE TOTAL CLEARANCE WOULD BE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE 
IT PROBABLY WOULD NOT WIN THE 
TEN THOUSAND HIGH BREAK PRIZE 
BUT IT IS A REASONABLE TARGET 
NONETHELESS 
CALLUS ON THE BLACK BUT WITH THAT 
BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO JOE PERRY REGAINS THE 
LEAD PELOUS 
THAT IS THE HIGHEST 
BREAK OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP SO FAR 
HE WON THE NEXT TWO AS WELL HE 
ONLY NEEDS ONE MORE FRAME TO SECURE 
HIS SECOND ROUND PLACE BUT GRAEME 
DOTT WILL NOT GIVE UP WITHOUT A 
FIGHT HE HAS ESTABLISHED A TWENTY TWO 
POINT ADVANTAGE 
THIS IS JOE PERRY'S 
THIRD MATCH WINNING CHANCE 
WRONG ANGLE ON THE BLUE TO GET NEAR 
THE YELLOW 
IS HE GOING TO GET ANOTHER CHANCE 
IT LOOKS UNLIKELY NOW 
HE HAS OVERRUN HIS INTENDED 
POSITION FOR BLUE THE POSITION OF 
PINK IS NOT OFFERING A 
STRAIGHTFORWARD CLEARANCE EITHER 
HE HAS GOT AN ANGLE ON THE BLUE HE DIDN'T TAKE A CHANCE OF RUNNING 
TOO FAR DOWN THE TABLE NOT LEAVING 
HIMSELF THE POT GOOD CHOICE 
NOT EASY AT THE BEST OF TIMES 
PRETTY DIFFICULT WHEN IT IS MATCH 
BALL BUT ONE 
FAR FROM AN EASY POT THAT ONE BUT 
DOTT MADE SURE HE GOT THE CUE BALL 
TO THE CUSHION ENOUGH 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A VERY GOOD 
SHOT AND GIVING THE FRAME AWAIT IS 
SLIGHT GIVING THE FRAME A WAY 
WELL IT IS AVAILABLE FOR JOE PERRY 
BUT I THINK THE CUT IS TOO THIN FOR 
HIM TO JUST ROLE IT IN AND STAY ON 
THE BLACK ROLE IT IN 
PERHAPS TOO MUCH CONCENTRATION ON 
POSITION THERE 
A FOURTH POSSIBLE MATCH CLINCHING 
CHANCE HAS GONE DOWN 
I DON'T THINK 
THE PINK IS ON INTO THE MIDDLE 
POCKET 
VERY GOOD GRAEME DOTT IS STILL IN 
THE MATCH JOE PERRY HAS MISSED 
MATCH WINNING CHANCES 
JOE PERRY HASN'T BEEN BEYOND THIS 
FIRST ROUND STAGE SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR BUT 
HE IS ON THE BRINK OF VICTORY IN 
THE NEXT FRAME ON THE BREAK OF FORTY TWO MATCH BALL THEN EFFECTIVELY DOTT CAN ONLY HOPE 
ISN'T IT DIFFICULT TO POT THE 
WINNING BALL AND THAT ONE WASN'T 
ALL THAT EASY IN THE FIRST PLACE 
IT WASN'T HELPED BY HAVING TO PUT 
THE EXTENSION ON HIS CUE AS WELL 
I'M NOT SURE IF GRAEME DOTT PLAYED 
THAT SHOT BUT IT SWERVED IN HIS 
FAVOUR IT HAS BROUGHT BLACK INTO 
PLAY THE BLUE IS SAFE AS WELL WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A VERY GOOD 
CLEARANCE TO PINCH THE FRAME 
ALWAYS GOING TO BE SAFE DOWN THAT 
SIDE OF THE TABLE WITH THE BLACK 
AS GOALKEEPER HE CAUGHT THAT MUCH TOO THIN 
AS IT HAS TURNED OUT IT IS A 
CHANCE L. MENTIONED THE BLUE EARLIER 
IF HE CAN CARRY ON UP TO THE BROWN 
THERE IS A GOOD ANGLE TO DISLODGE 
THAT AWKWARD BLUE 
BROWN PLUS THE COLOURS IN SEQUENCE 
WOULD ENABLE HIM TO SNATCH THE 
FRAME BY A SINGLE POINT 
HE HAS PLAYED TO BRING THE BLUE OUT 
THIS TIME I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT 
BECAUSE HE COULD HAVE PLAYED THE 
GREEN GET ON THE GREEN IN A GOOD 
POSITION AND LEFT AN AUTOMATIC 
ANGLE ON THE BROWN TO GET THE BLUE 
OUT THAT COULD HAVE GONE WRONG 
THE BLUE HASN'T COME INTO PLAY AND 
HE HAS LEFT THE GREEN INK NOT SUCH 
A GOOD POSITION SO I THINK THE 
CHANCE HAS GONE LEFT THE GREEN 
IN IT NOT SUCH A GOOD POSITION HE 
DID NOT HAVE AND NOT A LOT OF 
ANGLE TO DISLODGE THAT BLUE HE HAS 
STILL GOT AN ANGLE ON THE GREEN 
BUT I THINK HE HAS GONE TOO FAR 
HE HAS PLAYED FOR IT IT IS A 
DOUBLE 
TERRIFIC DOUBLE NOT THE GREATEST 
POSITION FOR PINK THOUGH FAR FROM 
IT IF HE POTS THE PINK THOUGH HE 
CAN POT THE BLACK FROM ANYWHERE OH HOW CLOSE WAS THAT 
YOU CAN SEE THE EMOTION SO CLOSE 
BUT HE PLAYED THE RIGHT SHOT THAT WAS MATCH BALL FOR PERRY FOUL GRAEME DOTT SIX 
DOESN'T MAKE ANY MATERIAL 
DIFFERENCE IN THAT DOTT STILL 
NEEDS BOTH THE PINK AND THE BLACK 
AND PERRY NEEDS ONLY THE PINK 
OH THAT WAS A POOR SHOT FROM 
GRAEME HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH IT L. 
DON'T THINK JOE CAN TAKE THIS PINK 
ON WITHOUT TAKING THE CUE BALL NEAR 
THE BLACK 
DOTT HAD TO GET THE PINK 
DOWN THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE 
TABLE WITH BLACK COVERING THE 
POCKET 
A BIT ON THE WEEK'S SIDE ANOTHER 
CHANCE AT MATCH BALL FOR PERRY A 
BIT ON THE WEAK SIDE 
YOU SAID IT EARLIER CLIVE THE 
MORE CHANCES ARE MISSED THE MORE 
DIFFICULTY THERE IS IN EVERY ONE 
THAT CROPS UP AFTER THAT 
WELL I EXPECTED TO SEE THE PINK A 
BIT NEARER THE BAULK CUSHION WELL WELL THIS SHOT IS ON BUT YOU WOULD 
NORMALLY PLAY THIS WITH A LOT OF 
RIGHT HAND SIDE TO HELP THE PINK 
BUT IF HE DOES THAT THE BLACK 
COMES INTO PLAY 
IT WAS FAR FROM THE EASIEST MATCH 
CLINCHING CHANCE THAT JOE PERRY HAD 
HAD BUT HOW RELIEVED HE MUST BE 
HE DID HAVE SOME TROUBLE CLINCHING 
VICTORY BUT HE PLAYED 
EXCEPTIONALLY WELL OTHERWISE WITH 
ITS THREE CENTURIES 
I HAD SORT OF TOLD MYSELF I HAD A 
REALLY TOUGH FIRST ROUND MATCH HAD 
I TURNED UP AND DECIDED NOT TO PLAY 
I WOULD HAVE DEALT WITH THAT 
ACCORDINGLY BUT I PREPARED HARD 
FOR A TOUGH FIRST ROUND MATCH AND 
IT WAS 
I PLAYED WELL JOE PLAYED 
MAGNIFICENTLY THAT IS THE BEST I 
HAVE EVER SEEN HIM PLAY I'M SURE 
HE WILL SAY THAT HIMSELF L. AM SURE HE HAS HAD BIGGER SCALPS THAN ME 
BUT HE WAS FANTASTIC 
I WILL BE 
STRAIGHT BACK TO EARTH WHEN I 
HOME I HAVE AN EIGHTEEN MONTH OLD BABY 
SHE WILL PUT THE RIGHT L. L. WILL 
CHILL OUT AND RELAX FOR COUPLE OF 
DAYS WITH MY WIFE AND CHILD AND BE 
BACK ON SATURDAY WITH MY SERIOUS 
HEAD ON AND HOPEFULLY BE IN THE 
SAME FRAME OF MIND 
IT REALLY 
DOESN'T WORRY ME AS LONG AS MY 
HEALTH IS O. K. NEXT SEASON I WILL 
HOPEFULLY PLAY THE WAY I PLAYED 
THERE I WAS BACK TO NORMAL 
IT IS 
GREAT TO SEE GRAEME DOTT SOUNDING 
CHIRPY EVEN THOUGH HE HAS GONE OUT 
IN ROUND ONE WELL DONE TO JOE 
PERRY A TERRIFIC VICTORY WE WILL 
BE SEEING RONNIE O'SULLIVAN'S FIRST 
MATCH OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP WHEN WE 
HAVE HAD THE SECOND RACE FROM 
NOTTINGHAM NOTTINGHAM JOHN PARROTT HAS BEEN WORKING VERY 
HARD AS WE ALL KNOW AND HE HAS 
COME UP WITH AN INTERESTING FACT I I THINK THAT WAS CLAIRE MCAVOY'S 
FIRST WIN OF THE SEASON CORRECT CORRECT HIS FIRST WIN OF LAST SEASON CAME 
IN SIMILAR COLOURS BUT THE SAME 
TRAINER A HORSE CALLED SCARLET 
RUNNER 
I BET YOU WERE SOMEWHERE RUNNER EXOTIC I WAS IN ON THE BEACH IN EXOTIC SAINT LUCIA LET'S REMIND OURSELVES 
WITH WHAT HAPPENED IN THE FIRST 
RACE DOUBLE BANDIT WAS THE WINNER 
HE IS NOW LIKELY TO HEAD FOR THE 
CHESTER CUP HE'S SIXTEEN TO ONE THE TROPHY 
WAS PRESENTED TO SIR THOMAS 
PILKINGTON THE OWNER OF THE HORSE 
LET'S GET TO THE RUNNERS AND RIDERS 
FOR THE SECOND RACE A REALLY GOOD 
CONTEST COMING UP 
BEST PROSPECT IS MY SELECTION FOR 
THE RACE YES AND THE PRICES ARE AS FOLLOWS CABINET IS MY FANCY UNFORTUNATELY 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE HORSES IN 
THE PADDOCK AN INTERESTING FOUR YEAR OLD HE 
HAS VERY SOLID HANDICAP FORM THE

THIRD AT PONTEFRACT THERE IS A 
SOLID CHANCE IN AT OPEN HANDICAP

HAS A TOUGH TASK BUT IS OPEN TO 
IMPROVEMENT 
THIS IS A TEARS OF A IMPROVEMENT CLOWN A GUTSY WINNER AT ASCOT IN 
JULY MORE IMPROVEMENT TO COME THIS 
SEASON NORTHERN JEM WAS THIRD AT YARMOUTH 
HE IS ANOTHER HORSE WHO HAS BEEN 
TOUTED BY HIS TRAINER I'M SURE 
THERE IS IMPROVEMENT TO COME ONE 
TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIS NIGHT 
CRESCENDO A HORSE WHO RAN WELL 
LAST SEASON HIS TRAINER AMANDA 
PERRETT DOESN'T BRING A LOT OF 
HORSES TO NOTTINGHAM BUT WHEN SHE 
DOES WORTH BEARING IN MIND THAT 
SHE HAD FIVE RUNNERS LAST SEASON 
AND TWO OF THEM HAD BIG HANDICAPS 
MASLAK HAS BEEN DOING REALLY WELL 
ON THE ALL WEATHER BUT HE IS NOW ON 
TURF AND WE CAN'T BE SURE WHETHER 
HE WILL TRANSFER HIS ABILITY TO IT 
VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW YOU ARE 
GETTING A BIT 
HE IS NUMBER SEVEN 
CABINET THE TRAINER AND JOCKEY IT 
IS A COMBINATION YOU HAVE TO BEAR 
IN MIND FOR THE SEASON L. L. BACKED 
HIM ON HIS FIRST RUN OF THE SEASON 
AND HE NEEDED THAT RUN BECAUSE HE 
IS A STRONG HORSE L. WONDER HOW FIT 
HE WILL BE TODAY 
PLENTY OF PEOPLE 
THINK HE IS READY TO GO TODAY HIS 
HANDICAP FORM IS SOLID 
SIR MICHAEL STOUTE'S STABLE

PERFORMANCE FIRST TIME OUT THE 
OTHER HORSE HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF 
CRIME THAT PONTEFRACT FORM WITH 
HEAVEN KNOWS HAS BEEN THANKED IN NO

YARDS TO GO THROUGH FOR THE 
FIREPOWER WE ARE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF RYAN 
MOORE THROUGHOUT THE SEASON 
MENTIONED ABOUT HIS STRENGTHS IN 
THE FINISH IT IS NOT JUST THAT BUT 
HIS TACTICAL AWARENESS HE HAD TO

WINNER 
I HAD THE WINNER L. L. PICKED WINNER CABINET HE DIDN'T GET BOXED IN 
EITHER EITHER SPEAKING OF WINNERS GRAEME DOTT 
JUST MISSING OUT THERE IT WAS A 
GOOD ATTEMPT HE MADE BUT JOE PERRY 
WE SAW HIM JUST COMING ACROSS THE 
LINE WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE WAY 
HE CLOSED OUT THAT MATCH EARLIER I I THINK HE WAS PLEASED TO GET OVER 
THE LINE THAT IS THE CASE IN THE 
FIRST ROUND IN HIS PRESS 
CONFERENCE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT 
THE FACT HE DID NOT KNOW IF HE WAS 
GREAT TO BE PLAYING SO HE HAD TO 
PREPARE FOR TOUGH ONE IN A WAY 
BOTH PLAYERS ARE WINNERS BECAUSE 
GRAEME IS OVER THE WORST OF THINGS 
HE HAS SPOKEN ABOUT THIS HE WILL 
BE ABLE TO REGROUP ON NEXT YEAR HE 
WILL NOT HAVE THE WORRIES OF 
SNOOKER PERFORMANCE ON HIS MIND 
THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT 
EVEN THOUGH SNOOKER WILL BE PART OF 
THE THERAPY IN SOME RESPECTS 
YESTERDAY WE DISCUSS THE FACT THAT 
GREEN HAD SAID HIS OBJECTIVE WAS 
NOT TO WIN THE WORLD TITLE BUT JUST 
TO GO AWAY FEELING IN GOOD HEALTH 
CORIA HAD SAID 
THERE ARE TIMES 
WHEN YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR 
PERFORMANCE TOO MUCH YOU CAN DIG 
YOURSELF INTO A WHOLE TO COME OUT 
AND PLAY CAN BE A BREATH OF FRESH 
AIR 
JOE PERRY NOW MEETS STUART AIR BINGHAM WHO JUST SQUEAKED OVER THE 
LINE AGAINST YOU 
BOTH PLAYERS HAVE 
HAD GOOD WORKOUTS IN THE FIRST 
ROUND IT WILL BE A FAIR FIGHT 
BOTH WON IT TEN TO EIGHT IT WILL BE TOUGH 
TO CALL A TOUGH MATCH 
WE WILL BE 
TALKING ABOUT THAT IN A COUPLE OF 
DAYS THE ONE WE ARE ALL LOOKING 
FORWARD TO AND FOR MANY OF YOU 
THIS WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP DOES NOT 
GET GOING UNTIL THE APPEARANCE OF

FASCINATING MATCH WE ARE IN FOR SEVENTEEN 
YEARS OF AGE LIU CHUANG L. HAVE 
NEVER SEEN HIM PLAY L. AM REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS 
WELL THAT SHOT TELLS YOU HE IS NOT 
A RECKLESS PLAYER BECAUSE THERE 
WAS A RED ON RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
TAPPING THE TABLE IN 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THAT FINE SAFETY 
SHOT 
AND QUITE A GOOD SAFETY SHOT 
BECAUSE TO GET BACK UP THE TABLE 
AGAIN THOSE TWO REDS ARE AWKWARDLY 
PLACED THE TWO REDS NEAR THE BLUE VERY WELL PLAYED 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN DREW DOING LAST 
YEAR IN THE FIRST ROUND HE IS 
GETTING USED TO PLAYING THESE YOUNG 
LADS HE DREW DING JUNHUI HAVE HAVE YOU SEEN HIM PLAY BEFORE 
YES I 
SAW HIM PLAY IN PRESTATYN IN THE 
QUALIFIERS 
IS HE A GOOD POTTER WHAT A SHOT 
FIRST EVER POT AT THE CRUCIBLE 
THEATRE AND IT IS A PRETTY GOOD 
ONE 
IT IS QUITE INCREDIBLE THESE DAYS 
TERRY AS AN AMATEUR IN OUR DAY 
IT TOOK SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS JUST 
TO BE AN AVERAGE PLAYER HOW THESE 
PLAYERS GET TO THIS STANDARD SO 
QUICK IS AMAZING 
IT IS NOT THE 
TIME THAT COUNTS DENNIS THESE 
YOUNG LADS ARE JUST PLAY EIGHT 
HOURS EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK WHEN 
WE WERE AMATEURS WE DIDN'T HAVE 
TIME WE HAD JOBS FAMILIES 
DIFFERENT DAYS L. WAS QUITE HAPPY 
WHEN I WAS AN AMATEUR BUT A MATURE 
QUICKER NOW THEY HAVE GOT SO MANY 
HOURS OF TELEVISION THEY MATURE 
QUICKER THEY CAN LEARN FROM THE 
TOP PLAYERS IN AL UDEID THERE WAS 
NOTHING ON THE T. V. IN OUR EARLY 
DAYS IN OUR DAY 
YES THE ONLY 
SNOOKER IN THOSE DAYS WAS ON 
GRANDSTAND IN THE LATE FIFTIES EARLY 
SIXTIES WITH JOE DAVIS RICKY DAVIES 
JOE PULMAN ALL IN BLACK AND WHITE 
YOU HAD A T. V. DID YOU YOU WERE 
WELL OFF IN THOSE DAYS IF YOU HAD TELEVISION 
THAT'S NOT BAD HE MAY NOT BE ABLE 
TO HOLD FOR THE BLACK HE MAY HAVE 
TO GO FOR THE BLUE BUT HE PLAYED 
THE CORRECT SHOT TO DEVELOP THOSE 
FIVE REDS 
I THINK HE CAN STUN PAST THIS RED 
TO LEAVE HIMSELF ON THE BLUE A WEE 
BIT STRONG O. K. THOUGH 
MIGHT HAVE TO USE THE PINK AND REDS 
AGAIN TO HOLD THE WHITE A CANNON 
ONTO THE PINK AND RED HE WOULD BE 
O. K. WOULDN'T HE 
THAT'S THE OTHER THING WITH THESE 
YOUNG LADS THEY ALL PLAY THE RIGHT 
SHOTS 
HE WON FIVE MATCHES TO QUALIFY TO 
COME HERE KNOW HE BEAT FEW OF 
THE CRUCIBLE PLAYERS WHO'VE BEEN 
HERE A FEW TIMES LEE WALKER I 
THINK HE WAS NINE TO FOUR UP ON WALKER 
WALKED HIM BACK TO NINE TO NINE AND HE WON 
THE DECIDER DOMINIC DALE OF 
COURSE DAVID GRAY BE DOMINIC DALE 
TEN TO NINE IN THE FINAL QUALIFYING ROUND 
AGAIN HE WAS IN FRONT OF DOMINIC 
DOMINIC CAME BACK AND I THINK HE 
MADE A SEVENTEEN THE DECIDER DENNIS 
INCREDIBLE 
JUST UNDER DID THAT THAT IS THE 
FIRST SLIGHT ERROR HE HAS MADE 
HE IS HAMPERED SLIGHTLY WITH THIS 
RED 
THAT WAS A SLIGHTLY TRICKY POT 
THERE BUT A VERY GOOD START FROM 
LIU CHUANG 
I'VE NEVER SEEN RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
LOOKS SO FIT ALL OF THIS RUNNING 
HE IS DOING HE LOOKS AMAZING UP 
IN THE PLAYERS' ROOM HE IS DOWN TO AT TWENTY EIGHT SIZE WAIST 
TAKES ANOTHER TWO INCHES OFF THERE 
DENNIS HE WILL CATCH YOU UP 
I WAS LOOKING AT AN OLD PHOTO OF 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN AT HOME NEAR THE 
DAY HE WAS SO CHUBBY WHEN HE 
WAS SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN 
IT SHOWS YOU WITH THAT SHOT HOW 
ACCURATE THE PLAYERS ARE WHEN THEY 
PUSH THE CUE THROUGH 
A BIT TOO HARD THIS ONE HE WAS 
PLAYING TO LEAVE THE RED IN THE 
SAME POCKET 
THE MIDDLE OF THE THREE REDS WAS 
THE ONE HE WOULD LIKE TO HIT IT'S 
ALL RIGHT HE CAUGHT THE OTHER ONE 
BUT IT'S STILL DIVIDED THEM ALL 
HE'S GOT TO BE A WEE BIT CAREFUL 
HERE BECAUSE OF THE BLACK DOESN'T 
GO INTO THE POCKET HE IS POCKETING 
THE RED HE IS PLAYING IT LEFT 
HANDED A FLICK ON THE BLACKS 
BOILED A. NO HE IS O. K. HE'S THE 
RIGHT SIDE OF THE BLUE ON THE 
BLACK SPOILED IT 
HE IS NINE AHEAD HE WAS JUST WONDERING IF HE COULD 
SCORE ENOUGH WITHOUT THE SLIGHTLY 
DIFFICULT RED THAT'S TO THE LEFT OF 
THE WIDE 
THE WHITE IF HE IS STRAIGHT HE 
CAN LEAVE AN ANGLE ON THE PINK 
DROP ON THAT LAST RED WILL DEVELOP 
IT 
HE TOOK HIS TIME WITH THAT EFFORT 
BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT IT 
WAS 
HE WAS A WEE BIT UNLUCKY TO LEAVE 
HIMSELF HAMPERED HE STILL WOULD 
HAVE FANCIED KNOCKING THE BLACK IN 
BUT THAT'S HISTORY HE KNOWS ONLY 
TOO WELL HE HAS PLAYED IN CHINA 
WHERE RONNIE BEAT HIM FIVE TO ONE HE KNOWS 
HE CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE MANY 
MISTAKES AGAINST RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
I WOULD IMAGINE HE WOULD BE LIU 
CHUANG'S KEY ROLE IN THE GAME HE ROLE IN THE GAME 
JUST PLAYING AN EXHIBITION TYPE 
SHOT BUT A VERY ENTERTAINING 
OPENING FRAME IT WAS THE YOUNG 
CHINESE PLAYER WHO GOT IN WITH A THIRTY TWO 
BUT RONNIE O'SULLIVAN THAT THAT SEVENTY SIX 
BREAK GIVES HIM THE FIRST FRAME 
RONNIE CAN JUST IN BUT AT LEAST TO 
ONE HAS HAD HIS HAND ON THE TABLE 
HERE HERE THIS YOUNG FELLOW HAS HAD TO WIN 
FIVE QUALIFYING MATCHES JUST TO BE 
AT THE CRUCIBLE THIS YEAR THIS IS 
A REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT IN ITSELF THAT WAS A BIT OF A NERVOUS ONE 
IT JUST DEPENDS HOW MANY RONNIE 
SCORES FROM THAT ERROR 
I THINK LIU CHUANG IS VERY MUCH 
SECOND FAVOURITE TO WIN THE MATCH 
BUT HE IS A GOOD PLAYER IT WILL 
HELP HIM THAT HE HAS HAD A MATCH 
AGAINST RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IN THE 
CHINA OPEN 
HE HIT IT PERFECT 
YET HE PLAYS 
THAT TYPE OF SHOT SO WELL 
HE IS SECOND ONLY TO STEPHEN HENDRY 
WITH THE AMOUNT OF CENTURY BREAKS RONNIE HAS MADE FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN CENTURIES 
HE IS THE NEAREST ONE TO STEPHEN 
HENDRY WHO HAS JUST OVER SEVEN HUNDRED 
JUST USE THAT PACK OF REDS NOW TO 
HOLD THE WHITE 
I JUST LOVE WATCHING THIS SNOOKER 
PLAYER AROUND THE TABLE L. STILL 
THINK HE'S THE ONLY PLAYER I WOULD 
NEVER USED THE WORD GENIUS ABOUT 
EVER USED THE WORD GENIUS ABOUT 
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGET THAT 
HE SWITCHES HANDS BECAUSE IT LOOKS 
SO NATURAL HE IS 
GOING 
TO NEED THE DIFFICULT 
RED IF HE IS GOING TO MAKE A 
CENTURY HE WAS TRYING TO LEAVE AN 
ANGLE ON THE BLACK TO TRY TO MOVE 
IT HE STILL FORCED IT OVER WELL 
PLAYED THAT'S NOT EASY 
IT DOESN'T GO IN BUT IT DOESN'T 
REALLY MATTER RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
TAKES JUST OVER EIGHT MINUTES TO 
WIN THAT ONE 
LIU CHUANG HAS HAD A 
CHANCE TO SEE HIS IDOL IN FULL FLOW 
WHAT'S IT LIKE PLAYING YOUR HE 
WROTE CAN YOU REMEMBER 
MY HERO IS 
RAY REARDON IT WAS EXCITING THE 
THOUGHT OF PLAYING SOMEBODY THAT 
WAS THAT HIGHER UP L. DON'T THINK 
YOU'D TRIANGLE BE SO DOWN HIMSELF 
SHOULD IT GO WRONG HE MUST HAVE 
BEEN SO EXCITED COMING HERE IF 
RONNIE WERE TO WIN THIS SESSION EIGHTY ONE 
PERHAPS HE COULD GET DOWN ON 
HIMSELF GENERALLY HE IS GOING TO 
RELISH THE CHANCE AT SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD 
HE OBVIOUSLY HAS A FUTURE IN THE 
GAME ALTHOUGH HIS RANKING DOESN'T 
GUARANTEE HIM TO BE A PROFESSIONAL 
NEXT YEAR THAT'S A PROBLEM HE'S HE'S PROVISIONALLY RANKED AROUND THE NINETY FIVE 
MARKED JUST THE HAVE WON FIVE 
MATCHES TO BE HERE IS EXTRAORDINARY 
TO BE DOMINIC DALE GREAT PLAYER 
HE CAN OBVIOUSLY PLAY THE GAME IT 
WOULD BE NICE IF HE GETS A COUPLE 
OF FRAMES ON THE BOARD SO HE CAN 
SEE WHAT HE CAN ACHIEVE 
WE WILL 
SOON SEE BECAUSE WE WILL BE GOING 
BACK TO THAT MATCH SHORTLY IN THE 
MEANTIME I'M NOT SURE WHETHER JOHN 
AND RICHARD HAVE STOP ARGUING ABOUT 
WHETHER YOU HAVE PICK THE WINNER 
YET YET THERE WAS A MASSIVE INQUIRY WE 
REVIEWED THE TAPES AND FOUND OUT 
THAT JOHN DID MENTION THEM IN A A 
CABINET 
YOU WON'T GET RICH AND IT CABINET BUT THANK YOU 
WHAT STAFF TO DO GET 
OUT OF THE FIRST PLACE 
EIGHTEENTH AND OF 
THE SEASON BEHIND FOUR RYAN MOORE 
USED THIS IS THE THE FOURTH WINNER 
FOR MICHAEL STOUTE AND HE HAS ONLY 
HAD TWENTY RUNNERS SO FAR PRETTY 
DECENT CABINET JUST WEARING DOWN JOE 
FANNING IN THE RED RYAN MOORE WERE 
SHOWING HIS ENORMOUS STRENGTH IN 
THE SADDLE JUST GETTING THE BETTER 
OF ERADICATE OUR FINAL RACE TODAY 
FROM NOTTINGHAM IS THE CONDITIONS 
STAKES OVER TEN FURLONGS IT 
FEATURES THE SECOND FAVOURITE FOR 
THIS VODAFONE DERBY IT'S HORSE 
CALLED CURTAIN CALL HE WAS TRAINED 
IN IRELAND LAST YEAR BY JESSICA 
HARRINGTON HE WAS ONE OF THE TOP 
TWO YEAR OLD IN IRELAND THERE IS 
FRANCESCA LEADING THE HORSE AROUND 
A FANTASTIC PROSPECT FOR THE SEASON 
HE IS IN THE BETTING NOW FOR THE 
DERBY JUST BEHIND TWICE OVER HE IS THE DERBY MARKET IS YET TO HAVE A 
REAL SHAKE UP I THINK 
HERE IS THE 
FIRST CLUE OVER A SIMILAR SORT OF 
TRIP IT'S ANOTHER TWO FURLONGS AT 
EPSOM BUT LEST LET'S TAKE THAT 
THREE RUNNERS WE CAN HAVE A LOOK AT 
THE HORSES IN THE PADDOCK AS WE SAW THEM A FEW 
MOMENTS AGO CURTAIN CALL 
FANTASTIC PERFORMANCES LAST SEASON 
FINISHED BEHIND A NEW APPROACH 
WHICH WAS THE OFFICIAL BEST TWO 
YEAR OLD IN EUROPE LAST YEAR 
HE IS 
OFFICIALLY A STONE WELL IN ON 
TODAY'S FIGURES IF HE IS FIT HE 
HAS GOT A MASSIVE CHANCE TODAY THE THE OTHER TWO HORSES IN THE RACE UP 
AGAINST CURTAIN CALL HAVE BOTH WON 
THEIR LAST START BOLD CHOICE AND 
DRILL SERGEANT BOLD CHOICE WAS A 
WINNER LAST TIME AT NOTTINGHAM SIXTEEN SIXTEEN AND A MAIDEN SOFT GROUND THE 
GROUND IS RIGHT IT'S A LEAP OF 
FAITH IF YOU THINK HE IS GOING TO 
BE THE FAVOURITE IF HE IS ANYWHERE 
NEAR STRAIGHT BUT HE REMAINS A 
NICE HORSE FOR THE SEASON 
AND HERE 
IS DRILL SERGEANT WHO WON HIS 
MAIDEN AT NEWCASTLE HE BEAT A 
COUPLE OF HORSES BY SOME DISTANCE 
HE LIKES TO MAKE THE RUNNING LIKE 
BOLD CHOICE AND CURTAIN CALL 
THAT'S THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT 
THIS RACE THE FACT THAT YOU ALL 
WANT TO MAKE THE PACE IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR A DERBY 
CONTENDER TO RUN AND WIN AT 
NOTTINGHAM BEFORE THE DERBY SLIP 
ANCHOR IN THE EIGHTIES WON AT 
NOTTINGHAM AS A TWO YEAR OLD BEFORE 
WINNING THE DERBY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE 
IT USED 
TO BE A POPULAR TRACK FOR HENRY 
CECIL IN THE GOLDEN YEARS I'VE 
BEEN AT NOTTINGHAM FOR A DAY'S 
RACING AND SEEN THE HORSES ON THERE 
THE NATURE OF THE TRACK ITS FLAT 
IT'S OPAL YOU'VE GOT FORTY FIVE FURLONGS 
WHEN YOU COME ON THE STRAIGHT IT 
SUITS THE GALLOPING TYPE THAT 
SHOULD SUIT ALL OF THESE FORCES 
TODAY HORSES L. THINK CURTAIN 
CALL SHOULD WIN TODAY L. DON'T 
THINK HE WILL BE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT STAKE HE 
HAS FORTY FIVE DAYS TO GO BEFORE HE GETS TO 
THE DERBY BUT I THINK YOU WILL BE 
PRETTY MUCH STRAIGHT 
IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING TACTICALLY TO SEE HOW 
THESE HORSES RUN OR SETTLE DOWN AT 
THE START OF THE RACE BECAUSE THEY 
ALL LIKE TO RACE PROMINENTLY WE 
KNOW THAT CURTAIN CALL CERTAINLY 
SEES OUT THE DISTANCE ON THE OUTSIDE DRILL SERGEANT BOLD 
CHOICE WANTS TO LEAD THIS WILL 
SATISFY THE RIVAL RIDERS INCLUDING 
JAMIE SPENCE ON CURTAIN CALL HE IS 
CONTENT TO DROP INTO THIRD AND LAST 
OF THE THREE RUNNERS AS THEY GO 
THROUGH THE FIRST FURLONG AND A 
HALF BOLD CHOICE IS SETTING HAS A 
GOOD GALLOP LEADS BY A LENGTH ON 
THE OUTSIDE IN SECOND DRAW 
SERGEANT WELL SERGEANT THEY 
CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY OVER THE FAR 
SIDE INSIDE THE SEVENTH FURLONG MARKER 
BOLD CHOICE WITH THE YELLOW CAP 
SETTING A REALLY GOOD PACE DRILL 
SERGEANT THE OUTSIDER AT THE 
SPOTTED CAP JUST DROPPING IN 
BEHIND THIRD IS CURTAIN CALL WHO 
WILL APPRECIATE THESE CONDITIONS 
TODAY AND THIS GENEROUS PACE THEY 
RACED TOWARDS A OH SIX OH FIVE FURLONGS 
FROM HOME THE LEADER YEAR IS BOLD 
CHOICE BY A LENGTH THEY MAKE 
THE TURN OF THE BACK OF THE COURSE RACING ACROSS THE TOP 
BOLD CHOICE WAS DISTANCE WINNER 
EIGHT DAYS AGO LEADS BY A NECK TO 
DRILL SERGEANT CURTAIN CALL THE 
SECOND FAVOURITE FOR THE DERBY IS 
POISED BEHIND THEM AND HAS THE 
LEADERS WELL AND TRULY IN HIS 
SIGHTS AS THEY COME INSIDE THE 
HALF MILE MARKER STRAIGHTENING UP 
FOR HOME AND ITS BOLD CHOICE THE 
FAR SIDE FOR THE LOOK ROBINSON 
CURTAIN CALL APPEARS TO BE GOING O. K. 
THEY COME INSIDE THE THREE BOLD 
CHOICE NOW ON THE OUTSIDE 
CHALLENGING DRILL SERGEANT BUT 
HERE IS CURTAIN CALL ON THE OUTSIDE 
LOOMING UP HE HASN'T MOVED ON HIM 
JAMIE SPENCER BOLD CHOICE ON THE 
BAR SIDE HERE IS CURTAIN CALL 
LOOMING UP HE STILL HASN'T PRESS 
THE BUTTON HE RACES TO HIM WITH 
EASE A FURLONG LEFT AGO NOW HE 
SAYS GO AND HE STARTS TO DRAW A WAY 
CURTAIN CALL GOES THROUGH LENGTHS 
IN FRONT NOW HE HAS GOT THEM WELL 
AND TRULY BEATEN AS THEY COME UP TO 
THE LINE CURTAIN CALL HE WAS 
SECOND FAVOURITE FOR THE DERBY 
BEFORE THIS HE WILL BE EVEN 
SHORTER NOW SECOND A DRILL 
SERGEANT AND THIRD IS BOLD CHOICE 
IT'S A CASE OF JOB DONE FOR CURTAIN 
CALL HE HAS DONE IT EASILY IN THE 
END THERE WAS A MOMENT AS HE 
TURNED INTO THE STRAIGHT JAMIE 
SPENCER NEEDED TO GET HIM ON AN 
EVEN KEEL AT THIS POINT HE IS ON 
THAT EVEN KEEL AND TRAVELLING 
EASILY 
THIS IS AN IDEAL EASILY PREPARATION FOR THIS HORSE HE HAS 
A NICE FAST GALLOP THE OTHER TO 
SET THE PACE FOR HIM HE SET IN 
BEHIND AND BROUGHT HIM WIDE TO BE 
HONEST THIS IS EXACTLY RIGHT 
BLOWN THE COBWEBS AWAY HE WILL GET 
MORE AND MORE IMPRESSIVE 
AS THEY 
CROSSED THE LINE OR AS CURTAIN 
CALL CROSSED THE LINE BLUCHER 
APPLES TO BE AS THOUGHT WAS WE HAVE 
GOT A DERBY HORSE JIMMY IS LOOKING UP AT THE SCREEN 
TO SEE HOW FAR CLEAR HE WAS 
HE HAS 
IMPRESSED ONE OR TWO OF THE BOOK 
MAKERS CORAL MAKE HIM SEVEN TO ONE FOR THE 
VODAFONE DERBY HE SHOULD STAY THE 
TRIP OVER A MILE AND A HALF THIS 
WAS A MILE AND A QUARTER TODAY 
IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGHER AGAINST 
BETTER HORSES BUT JUST TO CONFIRM 
THE ONE TWO THREE LUCA CUMANI WOULD NOT HAVE RUN HIM 
AT THE START OF THE SEASON L. S. E. WAS 
THE TYPE OF HORSE WHO NEEDED A 
CHANCE BEFORE THE DERBY 
THE MAIN 
THING IS TO GET AT LEAST ONE IN 
WHICH HE HAS GOT TODAY FORTY FIVE DAYS TO 
GO TO THE DERBY THAT IS ABSOLUTELY 
IDEAL PREPARATION HE HAS HAD A 
WORKOUT AND THE FURTHER HE HAS GONE 
THE BETTER HE HAS GONE KEEP KEEP GETTING QUOTES OF SEVEN TO ONE PADDY POWER 
THE LATEST BOOK MAKERS TO OFFER 
THAT ON CURTAIN CALL FOR THE DERBY 
LOTS OF HORSES TO PLAY OVER THE 
NEXT COMING WEEKS IT SEEMS SO FAR 
THAT EVERYTHING HAS GONE RIGHT FOR 
THIS HORSE 
SEVEN TO ONE MAY PROVE TO BE A 
DECENT PRICE THERE'S A LOT OF 
HORSES HAVEN'T COME OUT OF THE 
WOODWORK YET AT THE SAME TIME THE 
MARKET THE WAY IT IS SEVEN TO ONE HIS SOLID 
I IMAGINE THERE ARE LOTS OF CHANGES 
IN THAT MARKET BEFORE OUR NEXT RACE 
STAY ON THE B. B. C. JAMIE SPENCER AND LUCA CUMANI 
TERRIFIC PARTNERSHIP OVER THE LAST 
COUPLE OF SEASONS CAN'T WAIT TO 
SEE CURTAIN CALL RUN AGAIN BECAUSE 
I'M SURE HE WILL IMPROVE ENORMOUSLY 
FOR THAT HE 
IS STRONG HORSE HE IS TWO YEARS OLD HE IMPROVED WITH 
EVERY RUN I'M SURE WE WILL SEE A 
LOT MORE FROM HIM 
HE IS WITH THE 
RIGHT HANDERS L. WAS ACTUALLY AT 
PONTEFRACT THAT DAY HIGH RISE WON A 
MAIDEN 
THAT WAS AN ODDS ON SHOT L. MAIDEN KNOW WE DIDN'T TAKE IT UP WE WOULD 
HAVE 
I HAD TO OUT OF THREE HOW HAVE DID YOU DO 
HANG ON THE SECOND L. 
CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE STILL 
GOING ON ABOUT THE FACT ARE YOU 
TAKE THAT ONE THAT'S IT FOR THE 
RACING AT THE MOMENT LOTS OF 
SNOOKER TO COME I'M HOPING THAT 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN GETS A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
WHEN IT COMES TO TIPPING HE'S NOT 
BAD AT THE RACING BUT HE'S HOPELESS 
AT THE SNOOKER 
IT WAS JOHN HIGGINS LAST YEAR YOU YOU ALWAYS LIVED TO TELL THE TALE 
WE'RE HEADING BACK TO THAT RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN MATCH I'M SURE HALF OF 
CHINA DOES NOT HAVE THEIR FINGERS 
CROSSED FOR RONNIE BECAUSE THEY 
ARE SUPPORTING THEIR BOYS HERE 
WE WILL JOIN THEM IN FRAME THREE 
RONNIE IS EIGHT POINTS BEHIND AND 
WE HAVE SPED YOU TEN MINUTES OF 
SAFETY AS WE PICK THEM BACK UP 
THEY HAVE BEEN ON THE YELLOW FOR 
ABOUT TEN MINUTES I THINK 
WHEREAS THE YELLOW GOING THIS TIME 
WHERE IS THIS IS THE FIRST 
CHANCE EITHER PLAYER HAS HAD FOR TEN 
MINUTES 
IN THE END IT WAS EXPERIENCE THAT 
WON THE DAY THERE 
HE IS STILL SIX BEHIND HE NEEDS 
GREEN BROWN BLUE AND PINK 
BUT IT HAS TO BE SAID LIU CHUANG 
IS GOING TO BE THREE TO ZERO BEHIND BUT HE 
COULD HAVE WON ALL THREE GAMES 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT 
THREE VERY INTERESTING FRAMES AT 
THE START OF THIS MATCH THE SEVENTEEN 
YEAR OLD HAD A CHANCE IN OR THREE 
FRAMES BUT IT'S THE MORE 
EXPERIENCED RONNIE O'SULLIVAN WHO 
LEADS THREE TO ZERO 
AND THE SAME PATTERN IS EMERGING IN 
THE LAST BEFORE THE INTERVAL 
BECAUSE YOU TRY AND HAS ESTABLISHED 
A FIFTEEN POINT LEAD RONNIE IS BACK IN 
NOW LIU CHUANG 
HE IS PLAYING THE CROSS DOUBLE 
EXCELLENT SHOT HE WASN'T LEAVING ANY REDS ON 
JUST LOOKING AT ALL THE FINGERMARKS 
ON THE CLOTH DON'T KNOW WHEN IT IS A LITTLE BIT DAMP HERE TODAY 
IT DEPENDS ON THE PLAYERS SOME 
PLAYERS DRAG THEIR FINGERS 
CLIFF THORBURN WAS THE WORST I I HAVE HAD HIM AT HOME PLAYING ON THE 
TABLE AND IT TOOK THREE WEEKS TO 
GET THEM MARKS OUT OF THE CLOTH HE 
IS COMING OVER FOR THE LAST FIVE 
DAYS CELEBRATING TWENTY FIVE YEARS SINCE HE 
HAD THE FIRST EVER MAXIMUM BREAK 
I REMEMBER MY DAD MY WAS OBVIOUSLY 
UNBIASED AT THE END OF THE MATCH 
I LOST THIRTEEN TO TWELVE AND HE SAID IF YOU 
HADN'T AND THE RED YOU WOULD HAVE 
BEATEN HIM FLUKED THIS IS A BIT TOO HARD 
HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY THE 
CANNON IS THE PINK AVAILABLE IS 
IT COMING TO HIS RESCUE AGAIN HE 
CAN OPEN THE REDS IF HE CAN POT THE 
PINK 
I WOULDN'T FANCY HINT IF HE PLAYED 
ON THE BLACK WITH PACE HIM HE DIDN'T HANG BACK ON THAT ONE 
I SUPPOSE IT COULD HAVE FINISHED 
BETTER THAN THIS THIS IS A TRICKY 
CUT BACK THIS RED IF THE BLACK 
GOES I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE CAN 
GET THROUGH THE GAP TO GET TO THE 
BLACK BUT IT IS ALL ABOUT THE POT 
WELL PLAYED HE WILL BE ON THE 
BROWN HE HAS GOT A CHOICE OF BAULK 
COLOURS 
HE IS LOOKING TO HIT THE RED ON THE 
RIGHT SO HE CAN'T SEE THE POCKET 
THAT LOOKS TO BE IS IT O. K. I'M NOT SURE THAT WILL DO NICELY A GOOD CHANCE NOW 
HE COULD HAVE DONE WITH THE CUE 
BALL A FEW MORE INCHES UP THE TABLE 
ALL THE VIABLE REDS ARE DOWN THIS 
SIDE 
THE TWO REDS BY THE YELLOW SIDE ARE AVAILABLE INTO THE RIGHT CORNER 
POCKET BUT HE WOULD HAVE TO SCREW 
BY THE YELLOW TO GET THAT 
BETTER VALUE IN HEADING UP FOR 
THOSE HE COULD HAVE DONE WITH 
BEING STRAIGHT ON IT 
I THOUGHT HE 
WOULD HAVE PLAYED FOR THE ONE ON 
THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER WELL PLAYED 
HE HAS GOT A VERY GOOD CUE ACTION 
HE LOOKS VERY GOOD ON THE TABLE IT IS THE PLACE TO BE 
THESE YOUNG CHINESE PLAYERS KEEP 
THEIR HEAD STILL WHEN THEY PLAY THE 
CUE THAT IS THE KEY VERY LITTLE 
MOVEMENT THERE I'M NOT SURE DID 
HE PLAY TO MOVE THAT ONE THERE IS 
NO REASON TO HE IS FIFTY IN FRONT HE 
HAS STILL GOT THE ONE NEAR THE 
POCKET 
HE IS GIVING ME THE IMPRESSION AT 
THE MOMENT THAT HE CAN'T BELIEVE HE 
IS GOING TO WIN THIS FRAME 
IF THIS 
RED GOES IN AND HE DROPS ON A 
COLOUR YOU HAD BETTER BELIEVE IT 
I WOULDN'T HAVE PLAYED THE CANNON 
ON THE RED A WOULD HAVE MADE SURE 
I GOT UP AND MADE THIS AN EASY POT 
IT IS STILL COMFORTABLE POT BUT IT 
IS THE POSITIONAL SIDE 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO 
FINISH WHEN YOU CAN AND THOSE SO 
IT MAY HAVE TO BE A TRICKY PINK 
HERE 
HE HAS NUDGED THE RED OUT ON HERE TO THE CENTRE HE WILL BE FEELING 
NOW THAT HE KNOWS THAT IF HE MAKES 
A MISTAKE THE BALLS ARE WIDE OPEN 
FOR RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
VERY WELL DONE THAT WAS A TOUGH 
SHOT 
I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING SHOT THAT RED WAS HAMPERING HIM AS YOU 
SAY HE MOVED A FEW REDS OVER 
POCKETS 
HE IS JUST A COUPLE OF POTS AWAY 
FROM WINNING HIS VERY FIRST FRAME 
AT THE CRUCIBLE THEATRE 
NOW HE CAN RELAX A LITTLE BIT IT 
HAS TO BE SAID ALTHOUGH RONNIE HAS 
MADE SEVENTY SIX AND EIGHTY SEVEN THIS YOUNG MAN 
COULD HAVE WON OR FOUR OF THESE 
FRAMES BECAUSE HE WAS IN FIRST 
ALL 
I THINK HE WILL BE HAPPY WITH ALL ONE EXCELLENT STUFF 
HE HAS HAD SIX CENTURIES IN HIS 
CAREER HE HAS HAD SIX CENTURIES 
THIS SEASON AND HE HAS ONLY BEEN 
PROFESSIONAL FOR 
LOOKING AT HIS CAREER PRIZE MONEY 
ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY I'M SURE THAT WILL RISE IN 
THE NEXT COUPLE OF SEASONS 
THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE HIS MONEY FOR 
THIS CHAMPIONSHIPS FOR WHICH HE 
WILL GET ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND FOR 
QUALIFYING 
HE HAS STILL GOT A CHANCE OF MAKING 
A CENTURY BREAK 
I WONDER HOW MANY HE HAS MADE IN 
PRACTICE 
PROBABLY AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED LAST WEEK 
THEY PLAY ALL DAY 
THIS CRUCIBLE 
CROWD WENT REALLY GIVE HIM A 
TERRIFIC ROUND OF APPLAUSE WOULD 
REALLY GIVE HIM JUST A LITTLE BIT SHORT 
THE WAY HE IS LOOKING HE IS GOING 
TO SEND IT ALL THE WAY AROUND THE 
ANGLES THIS IS TOUGH 
GET IN 
EVEN RONNIE O'SULLIVAN WOODS LOVE 
TO SEE HIM MAKE A CENTURY BREAK 
WOULD LOVE 
WHAT A SHAME NOT TO BE 
BUT THAT NINETY TWO FROM LIU CHUANG GETS 
HIS FIRST FRAME ON THE BOARD 
YOU ARE UP TO DATE 
JOHN PARROTT WITH YOUR SNOOKER HAT 
ON ARE YOU WILLING TO TALK WAS 
ABOUT THIS GAME 
I THINK YOU SHOULD 
DOCTOR STEVE 
NOW WE HAVE HAD A CHANCE 
TO SEE WHAT HE CAN DO WHAT DO YOU 
THINK 
A VERY IMPRESSIVE TALK TO THINK STEVE ESPECIALLY FOR SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD 
GROWING UP IN CHINA HE HAS HAD 
SOME EXPERIENCE AGAINST THESE 
PLAYERS BUT NOT THE EXPERIENCE AS 
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD WOULD HAVE AROUND HERE 
TO HAVE COME ON IN LEAPS AND BOUNDS 
IS FANTASTIC THE VIDEO IS AROUND 
PEOPLE CAN WATCH THE TOP PLAYERS 
AND COPY IT IS A GREAT WAY TO 
LEARN AS GOOD AS COACHING ITSELF 
BUT EVEN SO HE LOOKED PRETTY 
COMPOSED 
I WAS TALKING TO STEVE COMPOSED EARLIER ABOUT PLAYING YOUR IDOL 
CAN YOU REMEMBER THAT EXPERIENCE 
YOURSELF 
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME SAY YOURSELF THAT BECAUSE HE IS SITTING HERE 
WHEN YOU SAID BEFORE IT WAS RAY 
REARDON COMING ON YOU ARE OLDER 
THAN THAT 
HE SLAUGHTERED ME ONCE 
ON A T. V. SHOW HE WAS THAT A TALL 
THE GIRL SAID IT IS THERE ANYTHING 
YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE STEVE DO HE 
SAID YES THE MACHINE GUN SHOT A 
TRICK SHOT FORTY FIVE MINUTES LATER I WAS 
STILL TRYING TO RECORD IT 
AND YOU 
HAVE GOT ON LIKE A HOUSE ON LUCK 
EVER SINCE BUT A HOUSE ON FIRE 
IT IS TIME WE CONCENTRATE ON A 
FEATURE WE HAVE JUST STARTED TO RUN 
SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WHEN THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
WAS FIRST STAGED HERE AT THE 
CRUCIBLE THE WELSH PLAYERS HAVE 
HAD A TERRIFIC SUCCESS THE LIKES 
OF RAY REARDON TERRY GRIFFITHS 
MARK WILLIAMS HAVE ALL WON HERE IF 
ANOTHER ONE DOES THIS YEAR YOU CAN 
BET THAT HUW EDWARDS WOULD BE 
DESPERATE TO BREAK THE NEWS TO THE 
NATION 
SNOOKER FOR ME MEANS TENSION 
EXCITEMENT FEAR SOMETIMES IF YOUR 
FAVOURITE PLAYER IS ON THE SKIDS 
BUT ABOVE ALL IT MEANS HUGE 
ENJOYMENT AND YEARS OF PLAY IF 
PLEASURE NO CONTEST I'M GOING TO 
TAKE YOU BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WHEN THE 
GREAT TERRY GRIFFITHS WON THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP BUT THE FINAL WAS NOT 
THE BEST MATCH AS I RECALL THE 
SEMI AGAINST EDDIE CHARLTON WAS BY 
FAR THE BEST MATCH OF THAT 
CHAMPIONSHIP AND YOU CAN IMAGINE 
THE COMBINATION OF STEADY EDDIE AND 
TERRY THE MATCH LAST ABOUT THREE 
AND A HALF WEEKS IT WAS GREAT 
MATCH TERRY WON THE SEMI AND HE 
BEAT DENNIS TAYLOR IN THE FINAL 
THE MATCH AGAINST EDDIE WAS THE 
BETS FOR ME THE GREATEST CRUCIBLE 
MOMENT IS THAT THE THE BEST 
TERRY IS FROM LLANELLI I AM FROM 
LLANELLI AND PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING 
TO BELIEVE THIS L. HAVE NEVER MET 
HIM IT IS ONE OF MY GREAT 
AMBITIONS ONE TO VISIT THE 
CRUCIBLE WHICH I HAVE PROBABLY 
SPENT YEARS OF MY LOVE WATCHING ON 
TELEVISION AND TWO THE I'D DEAL 
COMBINATION WOULD BE TO MEET HIM AT 
THE CRUCIBLE WHICH FOR ME WOULD 
BE THE SITE IDEAL 
I CAN PLAY AND I PLAYED LOT IN 
MY TIME AS A STUDENT I USED TO 
PLAY FOR HOURS SOMETIMES AT 
TERRY'S OWN CLUB IN LLANELLI AM 
NOT A FANTASTIC PLAYER BUT I ENJOY 
AND I AM ALWAYS TRYING TO IMPROVE 
MY CONTROL OF THE CUE BALL AND BY 
POSITIONAL PLAY SO WHY PLAYER LOT 
I PLAYED LOT I WILL BE WATCHING BECAUSE I WATCH 
IT EVERY YEAR IF I AM NOT IN I 
TAKE IT L. DON'T LIKE TO MISS ANY 
FRAMES AT ALL 
I LOVED TACTICAL BATTLES L. DO LIKE 
THE RAPID FIRE OF RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN THAT IS SPECTACULAR THING TO 
WATCH BUT I DO ENJOY TWO FANTASTIC 
LEE GOOD PLAYERS TRYING TO OUTWIT 
EACH OTHER WITH REALLY SKILFUL 
SAFETY PLAY FANTASTICALLY GOOD 
A CLOSET SNOOKER FAN TERRY 
GRIFFITHS HIS HERO IS IN THE 
COMMENTARY BOX THIS AFTERNOON L. 
THINK HE REMEMBERS MORE ABOUT NINETEEN SEVENTY 
MIND THAN YOU DO NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE 
I THINK 
SO L. WAS VERY LUCKY TO BEAT HIM 
BUT HE HAD HIS DAY IN EIGHTY FIVE 
I THINK 
IT WAS THE SEMI FINAL HE WAS 
TALKING ABOUT AGAINST EDDIE 
CHARLTON FOR HIM THAT WAS THE 
BEST MOMENT OFF IT CAN YOU 
REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT THAT 
IT WAS A 
VERY TIGHT HARD MATCH IT FINISHED 
AT ABOUT ONE FORTY AM AND DAVID VINE CAME 
ALONG AND SAID TO ME HOW DO YOU 
FEEL L. SAID I'M IN THE FINAL NOW 
AND THAT BECAME QUITE A FAMOUS 
PHRASE 
I KNOW HE IS A BIG SNOOKER PHRASE FAN L. THINK YOU HAD BETTER SEND 
HIM AN AUTOGRAPHED PHOTOGRAPH I I HAVE GOT A FEW OF THOSE LEFT ENJOY ENJOY THE MATCH BACK TO THE SERIOUS 
BUSINESS NOW THIS IS THE FIFTH FRAME 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN GETS 
THIS FIFTH FRAME UNDERWAY IN THIS 
INTRIGUING ENCOUNTER 
CAN LIU CHUANG SETTLE DOWN AFTER 
TAKING THAT PHRASE BEFORE THE MID 
FRAME INTERVAL THAT IS PRETTY GOOD FROM HIM WHAT A FANTASTIC POT 
AS WE SPEAK TERRY GRIFFITHS IS 
ALREADY SIGNING A LOVELY BIG 
PHOTOGRAPH FOR HUW EDWARDS 
THAT WAS THE SHOT HE CAN ONLY JUST 
GET PAST THE BROWN SENSATIONAL POT 
THAT NINETY TWO BREAK WOULD HAVE SETTLED 
HIM DOWN AND GIVEN HIM THE 
CONFIDENCE TO GO FOR SHOTS LIKE 
THAT 
I THINK HE PLAYED TO CANNON THE RED 
AWAY FROM THE BLACK BY THE LOOK OF 
IT AND HE DIDN'T QUITE GET THAT 
RIGHT IT SEEMS A VERY SMALL GAP TO 
GO THROUGH 
WASN'T HE UNLUCKY IF 
YOU DON'T GET THAT WOULD HAVE PULLED IT OFF 
NOT QUITE RONNIE HAS AN ESCAPE 
ROUTE BACK TO THE BAULK AREA HE HAS PUSHED ONE OVER THE CORNER 
THAT LAST SHOT THAT HE PLAYED HE 
DID JUST CATCH THE RED BUT HE DID 
SEEP A GAP AND HE ALMOST PULLED IT 
OFF THAT IS WHAT HE WAS LOOKING AT 
THAT IS WHAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
LEFT WITH 
HE HAS GOT A RED ON BUT THE 
BRIDGING IS SLIGHTLY AWKWARD WELL DONE 
HE HAS POTTED A FEW ALONG THE 
CUSHION AT PACE IN THIS MATCH AND 
HE MAKES THEM LOOK EASY BECAUSE 
THESE POCKETS ARE FAIRLY TIGHT 
THIS TYPE OF SHOT WHEN YOU FORCE 
IT YOU HAVE GOT TO BE SO ACCURATE 
IS HE ON THAT RED AT THE BACK OF 
THE BUNCH HE MAY HAVE WON PAST THE 
PINK THAT WILL DO JUST AS WELL 
ONE 
HE IS CATCHING RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
CUP IN O'SULLIVAN HAS SCORED TWO HUNDRED FORTY ONE 
POINTS AND LIU CHUANG HAS SCORED 
TWO HUNDRED EIGHT HE HAS GOT THE HIGHEST SCORE 
AS WELL 
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF 
ADRENALIN HE HAS A OVERSCREW CUT 
HE CAN STILL POT IT BUT HE SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN STRAIGHT ON IT TO LEAVE 
HIM ON THE BLACK OVERSCREWED THAT 
NOT DOING A LOT WRONG HERE AT THE 
MOMENT 
HE HAS HAD SIXTY PER CENT OF THE TABLE TIME 
THE ANYTHING HE IS NOT CATCHING 
RONNIE UP ON IS THE AVERAGE SHOT 
TIME BUT NOBODY DOES REALLY 
THE ONLY THING FIFTEEN SECONDS RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN 
TWENTY THREE SECONDS IS CERTAINLY NOT SLOW 
HE HAD BAD CONTACT THEN 
UNFORTUNATE THE RED WENT IN BUT IT 
HASN'T HELPED THE POSITION ON THE 
BLACK 
HE IS UNLUCKY THERE THE PACE HE 
PLAYED IT AT HE DESERVED A LOT 
BETTER THAN THIS YOU COULD SEE THE 
ARC ON THE CUE BALL THAT IS SO 
UNLUCKY TO STICK IN THERE HE 
COULD NOT HAVE PLAYED THAT ANY 
BETTER 
THIS YOUNG MAN HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN 
BLESSED WITH VERY GOOD TEMPERAMENT 
A LOT OF PLAYERS WITH MORE 
EXPERIENCE WOULD HAVE CRUMBLED WITH 
A THREE TO ZERO DEFICIT 
FIRST CLASS THAT POT NOT ONLY THE 
POT BUT THE POSITIONAL SIDE OF THE 
POCKET THE SHOT 
THAT WAS RONNIE O'SULLIVAN'S FIRST 
POT FOR JUST OVER TWENTY FOUR MINUTES THAT 
IS NOT INCLUDING THE INTERVAL OF 
COURSE 
THAT RED NEAR THE MIDDLE POCKET I 
DON'T THINK IT IS ON SO THAT COULD 
BE A STUMBLING BLOCK 
RONNIE HAS ALREADY HAD A LOOK AT 
THAT RED L. THINK IT IS OUT 
COMMISSION AT THE MOMENT IT IS 
THAT TOO ACUTE AN ANGLE 
HE IS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE GAME 
AT DISLODGING REDS OFF THE CUSHION 
TO CLEAR UP 
I THINK HE JUST LOOKED AT IT THERE 
NORMALLY HE WOULD GET ON THE BROWN 
OR YELLOW 
HE NEARLY MISSED THE RED HE WAS 
THINKING MORE ABOUT THE WHITE HE 
ALMOST MISSED THAT DOES THE YELLOW PAST PASS 
HE CAN DROP ON THE RED BUT THERE 
IS ALSO ANOTHER SHOT IF HE WANTED 
TAKE THE BROWN ON 
AT LEAST IT GETS YELLOW OUT OF THE 
WAY 
HE HAS GONE ACROSS THE TABLE HE IS 
ON THE YELLOW THAT IS WELL WORKED 
OUT THIS SHOT WAS NOT AVAILABLE TO 
HIM UNTIL THE YELLOW WAS REMOVED 
SO IF HE NUDGES THIS RED HE DOES 
NOT WANT TO PUSH IT TOO FAR 
OTHERWISE HE WILL KNOCK IT PAST THE 
MIDDLE POCKET 
HE HAS HIT IT A BIT TOO HARD IT 
DOESN'T GO PAST THE PINK GOOD SAFETY SHOT SNOOKERED NOT EASY TO HIT 
IT IS NEVER GOING TO BE EASY TO GET 
THAT RED OF THE GREEN BUT WE HAVE 
SEEN O'SULLIVAN PULL OUT THESE 
MAGIC SHOTS HE NEEDS TO BE CAREFUL 
BECAUSE HE CANNOT HIT THIS TOO HARD 
HE IS PUTTING A LOT OF SIDE ON VERY WELL PLAYED HE IS A WEE BIT UNLUCKY WE KNOW 
HOW GOOD RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IS AT 
THIS KIND OF SHOT BUT NOT THIS 
TIME L. THOUGHT THE WHITE WAS GOING 
TO CATCH THE JAW OF THE MIDDLE 
POCKET RONNIE HAD A GO AT THE RED 
IN THE LEFT CORNER WILL LIU CHUANG 
HAVE A GO AT THE ONE IN THE RIGHT 
CORNER 
HE MIGHT JUST GET AWAY WITH THIS 
IF IT FINISHES TIGHT ON THE CUSHION 
NO IF IT HAD STOPPED TIGHT ON THE 
CUSHION IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
DIFFICULT 
THAT NEEDS TO SLOW DOWN OH THAT 
WAS A GOOD SHOT FROM RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN THERE PLENTY OF ROOM TO 
GET ON YELLOW OR BROWN 
GOOD LENGTH WITH THE CUE BALL BUT 
I FEEL SURE HE WAS TRYING TO GET TO 
THE RIGHT OF THE CUE BALL HE HAD 
THE CHANCE OF THE SNOOKER 
YOU DON'T OFTEN SEE RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN MISS TWO CLEAR CUT 
CHANCES TO WIN THE FRAME 
WE TEND TO FORGET HE WILL BE 
FEELING THE PRESSURE OUT THERE 
BIT AS WELL FIRST ROUND OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS 
PEGGED BACK TO THIRTY ONE THREE TO ONE AND THEN 
LEE U. TWO CINK LI YUCHUN GOT A GOOD 
BREAK LIU CHUANG 
THERE HAS 
NEVER BEEN A PLAYER IN THE GAME 
THAT DOES NOT SUFFER FROM PRESSURE 
THE ONES THAT BECOME MULTIPLE 
WINNERS AND WORLD CHAMPIONS ARE THE 
ONES THAT CONTROL THE PRESSURE AND 
COPE WITH IT AND THIS YOUNG MAN 
MIGHT JUST BE ONE OF THOSE HE HAS GOT A BIT OF A PROBLEM NOW 
WELL THE FACT THAT THE YELLOW IS 
NEAR THE JAWS MIGHT HELP BUT IT IS 
STILL NOT EASY TO ESCAPE THE 
OBVIOUS LINE WOULD BE OFF ONE 
CUSHION NEARLY POTTED IT 
WELL THE GREEN IS A BIT AWKWARD 
WE KNOW RONNIE HAS GOT PLENTY OF 
CUE POWER HOW CLOSE TO THE GREEN 
CAN HE GET HERE 
IF HE CAN'T GET CLOSE HE IS BETTER 
OFF MAKING SURE HE CAN REACH IT 
WITHOUT HAVING TO USE THE REST HE 
HAS NOT DONE THAT CAN HE REACHED 
THAT JUST ABOUT PERHAPS CAN HE 
REACHED THAT REACH 
NO A BIT OF A STRETCH HE HAS GOT 
AWAY WITH IT BUT HE COULD BE IN 
TROUBLE HERE 
NOT QUITE IF HE HAD GOT IN BEHIND 
THE BROWN RONNIE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
IN ALL SORTS OF TROUBLE 
YES A BIG 
CHANCE GONE BY THERE 
I'M NOT SURE 
IF HE CAN USE THE BLACK AS A 
STOPPER AND GET THE WHITE UP THE 
TABLE SENT THE GREEN ON TO THE 
BLACK STOP NO NOT QUITE IT IS O. K. THOUGH 
HE IS GOING TO POT THIS NOW WITH 
DEEP SCREW BACK UP FOR THE BROWN 
O. THAT WOULD BE SOME SHOT TO TAKE 
ON AT THIS STAGE WELL HE WAS 
THINKING ABOUT IT BUT I LIKE THE 
FACT HE IS NOT RUSHING IT HE IS 
THINKING ABOUT THE SHOTS WORKING 
OUT THE PERCENTAGES 
THE KEY TO THIS GAME IS KNOWING 
WHEN TO GO FOR ONE WHEN NOT TO GO 
FOR ONE THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD SHOT HE MANAGED TO FIND THE GAP 
CAN HE POT THIS GREEN AND AVOID 
CONTACT WITH THE PINK IF HE CAN 
HE CAN GET BACK DOWN FOR THE GROUND 
FOR THE BROWN 
I THINK IF HE 
POTS THE GREEN HE WOULD FINISH ON 
THE PINK 
I TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS A PRETTY 
GOOD EFFORT LOOK WHERE THE WHITE 
FINISHED 
ANOTHER FRAME JUST PASSED THE TWENTY 
MINUTE MARK THAT IS THE SECOND ONE 
THE THIRD FRAME WAS THE LONGEST TWENTY FIVE 
MINUTES THAT ONE 
WELL WE HEARD FROM YORK NUMBER ONE 
FAN AT THE INTERVAL HUW EDWARDS 
WHO WAS SAYING HOW HE LOVED TO 
WATCH RONNIE PLAYING KNOCKING IN 
THE MAXIMUMS BUT HE PREFERRED THE 
TACTICAL PLAYERS HE IS GETTING A 
BIT OF BOTH HERE WE HEARD FROM 
YOUR NUMBER ONE FAN SO HE WILL BE 
ENJOYING THIS THAT IS ANOTHER 
GREAT SHOT PLAYED WITH LOTS OF 
SIDE HE HAS ALSO GOT HIM AWKWARDLY 
PLACED 
WELL THIS WOULDN'T BE A DIFFICULT 
SAFETY SHOT NORMALLY BUT ONCE 
YOU'VE GOT THAT SPIDER IN YOUR HAND 
WHEN YOU HIT DOWN ON THE CUE BALL 
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL 
THAT IS NOT BAD VERY GOOD SHOT THAT IS O. K. THAT COULD HAVE GONE 
WRONG ONCE HE GOT THE DOUBLE KISS 
BUT THE GREEN IS TOO FAR AWAY FROM 
THE POCKET TO DO ANYTHING WITH IT 
NO VALUE IN POTTING IT THERE IS NO 
EASY SAFETY SHOT ON 
IF HE DIDN'T HAVE THE REST IN HIS 
HAND HE COULD PROBABLY TAKE IT ON 
AND SCREW BACK WITH THE REST I 
DON'T SEE ANY WAY HE COULD SCREW 
BACK DOWN TO THE BROWN 
WELL DONE HE WILL PLAY SAFE FROM 
THERE 
YEAH THAT WAS ALL HE COULD DO HE 
HAS LEFT HIMSELF WITH A TOUGH 
SAFETY BUT IF HE CAN DOUBLE THE 
BROWN BACK UP THE TABLE PAST THE 
BLUE AND PINK THE BLACK IS NEAR 
THIS CORNER BLOCKING THINGS 
IT IS THE OLD TYPE SAFETY SHOT 
JUST UP AND DOWN HE HAS GONE THE 
OTHER WAY WHICH THEY TEND TO DO 
THESE DAYS THIS LOOKS PRETTY GOOD 
WHAT A TERRIFIC SHOT 
HE IS EXPERIENCING EVERYTHING HERE 
ON HIS FIRST TIME AT THE CRUCIBLE 
THE CURTAIN IS UP THE OTHER TABLE 
IS OFF SUCH BIG THEATRE FOR THIS 
YOUNG MAN TO PLAY IN 
WELL RONNIE 
DID HAVE RESULT THERE FROM THE 
POSITION HE WAS IN 
OH HE HIT THE BLACK HE HAS LEFT A 
FREE BALL THIS COULD BE END OF 
FRAME THE SCORES ARE ALL SQUARE 
FORTY FIVE POINTS EACH 
RONNIE CAN TAKE THE PINK AS IS FREE 
BALL HE WOULD SCORED FOUR POINTS 
FOR THAT OH HE HAS MISSED IT HE 
MISSED IT NOW YOU MENTIONED ABOUT 
A BIT OF PRESSURE TERRY RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN YOU HAVE TO PUT THAT 
DOWN TO A BIT OF TENSION YOU WOULD 
FEEL 
HE HAS BEEN GIVEN A BIT OF A FEEL HARD TIME IN THIS FRAME ALL CREDIT 
TO YOUNG LIU NOT QUITE NEEDED AN 
ANGLE ON THE BLUE HE HASN'T GOT IT 
BUT HAS HE GOT ENOUGH ANGLE TO POUR 
SIT ROUND THE TABLE FOR THE PINK 
TO FORCE IT 
WELL WHAT A TURNAROUND THIS COULD 
BE RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HAD A FREE 
BALL AND HE MISSED THAT SITTER OF A 
PINK WHAT A FRAME FOR THE YOUNG 
CHINESE PLAYER IT WAS A TOUGH SORT 
ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
IT WAS A TUSSLE ALL THE WAY 
THROUGH THROUGH THIS YOUNGSTER IS SHOWING NO FEAR 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HIM 
I SAW HIM 
A BIT IN THE QUALIFIERS SOME OF US 
HAVE TO QUALIFY HE HAS DONE WELL 
TO GET THROUGH THOSE FIVE MATCHES 
HE WAS ON THE NEXT TABLE TO ME 
ABSOLUTELY FLYING AGAINST DOMINIC 
DALE HE SHOWED A LOT OF COMPOSURE 
AND DETERMINATION FOR SOMEBODY OF 
SEVENTEEN HE CAN PLAY SAFE QUITE DECENT 
AS WELL HE HAS HAD A LET OFF THERE 
THE PINK OFF THE SPOT FROM RONNIE 
I DON'T THINK I HAVE SEEN RONNIE 
MISS ONE LIKE THAT HE DIDN'T EVEN 
HIT THE JAWS THAT IS POOR 
WHAT D. 
YOU PUT THAT DOWN TO 
I DON'T KNOW 
REALLY THE WORD LACK OF 
CONCENTRATION IS USED A LOT IN THE 
WORLD OF SNOOKER OBVIOUSLY 
PLAYERS ARE NOT CONCENTRATING 
EVERY NOW AND THEN PERHAPS A 
PLAYER THINKS IT IS AN EASY 
SITUATION HE HAS ALREADY WON THE 
FRAME BY GETTING THE MISTAKE AND 
TAKES THE BALL FOR GRANTED WHETHER 
IT IS A LACK OF CONCENTRATION OR 
JUST AN EASING UP OF KEEPING THE 
TENSION YOU NEED IN YOUR MIND BUT 
HE JUST COLLAPSED ON IT IT SEEMED 
HE WAS UPSET ENOUGH TO GO OUT TO 
THE TOILET SO IT OBVIOUSLY HAD ITS 
EFFECT 
LIU IS ALREADY DOING BETTER EFFECT THAN HE FEARED BASED ON THE ONLY 
TIME HE PLAYED RONNIE BEFORE AT 
THE CHINA OPEN RONNIE WANT FIVE TO ONE 
THAT WAS AN INTRODUCTION FOR NAME 
TO FIGHT LIU TO THE ROCKET HE IS 
CERTAINLY HOLDING HIS HEAD HIGH SO 
FAR 
STEVE DAVIS SAID EVERYTHING THERE 
APART FROM RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
BOTTLE BIT I THINK NOTHING WRONG 
WITH THAT ANYWAY RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN BOTTLED IT 
I'M JUST WONDERING HOW IT IS COME 
INTO EFFECT RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
VIRTUALLY THROWING THAT FRAME AWAY 
IN THE END HOW IT IS GOING TO 
AFFECT YOU NEVER KNOW WITH RONNIE 
SOMETIMES HE PUTS IT TO THE BACK OF 
HIS MIND AND SOMETIMES HE DOESN'T 
IT IS A MATTER OF HOW MUCH IT HELPS 
LIU CHUANG AS WELL HE WAS FIRST IN 
IN THAT FRAME AND LEAD BY FORTY ODD 
POINTS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
DISAPPOINTED TO LOSE IT 
WE'LL JUST SHOW YOU THE PINK AGAIN 
HE HAD A FREE BALL AND ELECTED TO 
TAKE THE PINK L. DON'T KNOW WHETHER 
HE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED OR WHETHER 
IT WAS JUST A BIT OF TENSION 
I THINK STEVE EXPLAINED IT QUITE 
WELL SOMETIMES YOU CAN FORCE AN 
ERROR FROM A PLAYER AFTER LONG 
SAFETY BOUT AND TAKE FOR GRANTED 
YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE THE BALLS 
NOT QUITE SHARP ENOUGH WHEN YOU GET 
DOWN FOR THE SHOT 
WHAT AN EARLY 
CHANCE 
NINE FRAMES TO BE PLAYED IN THIS 
FIRST SESSION 
WELL IF HE CARRIES ON LIKE THIS 
DENNIS WIN OR LOSE THIS MATCH HE 
WILL BE A HERO BACK HOME 
A WEE BIT UNLUCKY HE DIDN'T QUITE 
PUSH THE CUE THROUGH AS HE INTENDED 
UNLESS HE CAN GET TO THE POTTING 
ANGLE OF THE PINK IF HE CAN THAT 
WOULD BE VERY FORTUNATE 
WELL HE CAN'T GET TO THE PINK I 
DON'T THINK HE IS HAVING A LOOK 
JUST THINKING OF THE PICTURES GOING 
BACK TO CHINA SOMETHING LIKE ONE HUNDRED 
MILLION PEOPLE WATCHING NO 
PRESSURE THERE IS THERE THIS IS 
VERY TIGHT L. THINK HE IS A BIT 
DISAPPOINTED HE DIDN'T DROP ON THAT 
COLOUR BUT NO POINT TRYING TO POT 
A BALL THAT DOESN'T GO 
WE HAVE ALL 
DONE IT THOUGH OR TRIED TO DO IT 
COULD HAVE DONE WITH THAT CUE BALL 
A LITTLE CLOSER TO THAT CUSHION OH WHAT A CHANCE THAT WAS JUST THE PACE KEPT IT OUT 
I WONDER IF IT'S JUST CREPT INTO 
THE THOUGHTS OF LIU CHUANG THAT IF 
HE MISSED THAT RED HE WOULD BE 
LEAVING RONNIE O'SULLIVAN AMOUNT 
THEM IT CAN BE ENOUGH SOMETIMES TO 
TAKE YOUR MIND OFF THE POT 
LEAVING RONNIE O'SULLIVAN AMONGST 
THEM 
I'M NOT SURE IF THE PINK IS 
AVAILABLE INTO THE RIGHT CORNER HE 
IS NOT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE RED 
FOR THAT ANYWAY IN FACT HE HAD 
ENOUGH ANGLE TO GET UP FOR THE 
BLACK 
HE IS NOT STRIKING THE CUE BALL AS 
WELL AS HE IS EXPECTING CAN'T BE 
PERFECT ALL THE TIME BUT IT SEEMS 
WITH RONNIE WHEN HE GETS ON A RUN 
HE HITS IT PERFECT NINE TIMES OUT 
OF TEN AT THE MOMENT I WOULD GIVE 
HIM NO MORE THAN FIVE OUT OF TEN FOR 
HIS BALL STRIKING SUCH A SMOOTH 
CUEIST 
YEAH I THINK IF HE GOES CUEIST ON TO TAKE THIS FRAME HE WILL HAVE 
COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT 
PINK BUT IT HAS TO BE SAID LIU 
CHUANG HAD A COUPLE OF CHANCES AND 
HE COULD HAVE MADE RONNIE THINK 
ABOUT THAT MS. IF HE HAD GONE ON 
BECAUSE HE HAD A GREAT CHANCE EARLY 
ON THINK ABOUT THAT PERMITS 
MAYBE THAT'S PINK WOULD HAVE STILL 
BEEN IN HIS MIND THINK ABOUT BAD 
MISS 
OH THE RED HAS GONE IN I DON'T 
KNOW IF IT WAS A PLANT A BIT 
UNLUCKY RONNIE NEVER LOOKED AT IT 
BEFOREHAND HE JUST GOT DOWN AND 
SCREWED STRAIGHT INTO THEM L. GUESS 
SOMETIMES IT IS WORTH LOOKING TO 
SEE IF THERE IS A POSSIBLE PLANT ON 
NO YOU COULD NEVER HAVE FORESEEN 
THAT 
THAT WAS JUST VERY UNLUCKY THAT IS A POOR SHOT BECAUSE HE 
COULD HAVE HAD A FREE POT AT THAT 
IF HE HAD GOT ON THE BLACK AS HE 
INTENDED IT WAS A BAD MISJUDGEMENT FROM LIU 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN ALONG WITH 
STEPHEN HENDRY WOULD BE THE ONLY 
PLAYERS THAT YOU WATCH PLAYING ALL 
THE TIME EVEN WHEN THEY ARE 
STRUGGLING LITTLE BIT THEY CAN 
STILL MAKE THE BREAKS 
I THINK 
RONNIE IS STARTING TO LEARN TO COPE 
WITH THAT HE ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY 
AT HIS BEST EVERY TIME HE WENT TO 
THE TABLE L. THINK HE REALISES NOW 
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ACTUAL 
BEST TO WIN MATCHES WITH HIS 
TALENT HE CAN BE AT SIXTY SEVENTY PER CENT TO 
WIN MATCHES YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE 
AT YOUR BEST IT IS NOT THE WAY HE 
LIKES TO DO IT BUT SOMETIMES THAT 
IS THE CASE HE IS GOING TO NEED 
ONE OF THE REDS 
LOOK AT THAT EFFORTLESS MAYBE HE 
HAS GOT A BIT TOO FAR UNLESS IT 
GOES INTO THE RIGHT CORNER 
NOTHING AVAILABLE THERE SO THIS 
FRAME IS NOT OVER YET 
THIS IS 
TRICKY BECAUSE HE CAN'T JUST 
PLAYED THE CUE BALL DOWN TOWARDS 
THE BAULK AREA PLAY HE WOULD 
POSSIBLY LEAVE A SNOOKER ON HE 
COULD OF COURSE JUST ROLL THE RED 
PAUL WOOD AND DROP ON THE OTHER RED 
ROLL THE RED FORWARD 
THAT IS WHAT HE PLAYED HAS HE MADE 
A MESS OF THAT OR WHAT 
HE HAS 
MADE A COMPLETE MESS OF IT HE WAS 
TRYING A DELICATE LITTLE SHOT THERE 
JUST TO GENTLY HIT THE OTHER RED 
FULL BALL AND GET THE SNOOKER 
BEHIND THE YELLOW 
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WILL BE ON A 
QUESTION OF SPORT I THINK 
THIS IS 
THE YOUNG CHINESE PLAYER'S THIRD 
CHANCE IN THE FRAME THAT WOULD GET 
HIM LEVEL 
HAD TO GET UP THE TABLE TO A HIGHER 
VALUED COLOUR BECAUSE OF THAT 
DIFFERENCE 
THAT IS NOT THE BEST HE WILL HAVE 
TO FORGET ABOUT THE POT NOW THIRTY THREE 
THE DIFFERENCE HE NEEDS TO GET A 
RED AND A PINK AT LEAST VERY WELL PLAYED 
HE DIDN'T CLEAR UP BUT HE MAY GET 
ANOTHER CHANCE AFTER THAT SNOOKER 
FOUL AND A MISS LIU 
CHUANG SEVEN 
THAT MAKES QUITE A DIFFERENCE 
RONNIE IS HAVING LOOK AT THE 
SCOREBOARD HE DOESN'T NEED A HIGH 
VALUE COLOUR ONLY TWENTY SIX IN IT IT IS 
NOT A STRAIGHT FORWARD ESCAPE 
HE COULD SEE ENOUGH OF THE RED JUST 
TO SCREW BACK BEHIND THE BLUE WE 
HAD THE FRAME EARLIER WHEN RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN MISSED SNOOKER THREE OR 
FOUR TIMES ON THE SPIN 
HE IS SO 
CLOSE TO THE BLUE HE CAN'T COME 
OFF THE SIDE CUSHION THIS IS VERY 
TOUGH TO IT AND THE PINK IS 
SLIGHTLY IN THE WAY IF HE GOES 
ROUND THE ANGLES VERY TOUGH TO 
HIT 
THAT WAS A GOOD EFFORT 
FOUL 
LIU CHUANG FOUR LIU CHUANG COMING ROUND TO SEE HOW 
THIN THIS IS O. THE REFEREE HAS 
NOT CALLED A MISS THAT IS A GOOD 
TALKING POINT TERRY BECAUSE HE 
WASN'T THAT CLOSE TO THE RED JAN 
VERHAAS FELT IT WAS A VERY 
DIFFICULT SNOOKER BUT LOT OF 
REFEREES WOULD HAVE CALLED A MISS 
THERE 
A DIFFICULT SNOOKER TO HIT I'M NOT 
WANT TO GO WITH THE MISS RULE BUT 
I THINK THAT WAS A MISS 
THE WHITE WAS GOING SO FAST IT 
ALMOST WENT IN THE MIDDLE POCKET 
JUST OVERSCREWED IT SLIGHTLY HE 
WANTED TO BE STRAIGHT ON THE YELLOW 
THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH EASIER 
CAN HE AVOIDED THE BROWN AVOID JUST 
WHAT A FRAME THIS COULD TURN OUT TO 
BE FOR THIS YOUNG SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD 
SENSATION 
I THINK HE HAS GOT A SLIGHT ANGLE 
ON THE BLUE HE NEEDS BLUE PINK AND BLACK HE CUED THAT ONE VERY WELL 
WHAT A TURNAROUND WE ARE HAVING 
HERE 
WHAT A TURNAROUND AN 
UNCHARACTERISTIC MISTAKE FROM 
RONNIE IN THAT FRAME 
YES WITH TWO 
REDS LEFT A TRICKY SAFETY SHOT BUT 
I THINK RONNIE TRIED TO GET TOO 
CLEVER WITH THIS PUSHED THE RED 
FORWARD AND THEN PUSHED THE OTHER 
RED FORWARD THEN SNOOKERED BEHIND 
THE YELLOW YOU COULD SEE HIM DROP 
HIS HEAD THERE HE REALISED HOW 
MUCH OF A MISTAKE IT WAS HE NEVER 
RECOVERED FROM THAT 
NO IF HE HITS 
THE RED FULL BALL AND THEN JUST 
MAKES A PASS THE OTHER ONE IT LOOKS 
A GREAT SHOT UNFORTUNATELY HE HAS 
NOT AND HE HAS HIT THE YELLOW HE 
WAS NEVER IN THE DRIVING SEAT AFTER 
THAT AT SOME POINT YOU'RE GOING TO 
LEAVE IT WHEN YOU COME OUT OF THE 
SNOOKERS 
HE LIU CHUANG SHOWED SNOOKERS COMPOSURE IN GETTING OUT OF THAT 
FRAME 
WE EXPECT A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD TO FRAME HAVE COMPOSURE THAT MIGHT SOUND 
FUNNY TO PEOPLE LISTENING AT HOME 
BUT SNOOKER IS ABOUT DEGREES OF 
KEEPING YOUR BODY UNDER PRESSURE 
AND IN GOOD NICK A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD CAN 
DO THAT QUITE WELL IN THE BIG 
STAGE YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER HIS 
MIND WILL GET AHEAD OF HIMSELF HE 
HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN PRACTISING VERY 
HARD AS ALL OF THE CHINESE PLAYERS 
DO HIS TECHNIQUE IS SOLID UNDER 
PRESSURE THAT SHOWED ON THE PINK 
HE JUST ROLLED IN OFF THE SIDE 
CUSHION IT COULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO 
GET CLOSE TO THE FINISHING LINE AND 
MISSED THE PINK 
YOU TALK ABOUT THE 
COMPOSURE OF YOUTH BUT IS IT A LOT 
TO DO WITH FEARLESSNESS IN THIS 
SITUATION YOU HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND 
YOU HAVEN'T SUFFERED THE KNOCKS AND 
OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE 
HE IS NOT 
BATTLE SCARRED IS HE YOU GET IF 
YOU DEFEATS IN YOUR CAREER WHEN 
YOU HAVE IT MAKES YOU REMEMBER 
CERTAIN TIMES IN YOUR CAREER THE 
GOOD THING WITH HIM IS THAT HE 
PLAYS IN THE ACADEMY HE HAS GOT 
FANTASTIC PRACTICE PARTNERS TO PLAY 
WITH THE STANDARD THAT HE IS 
PLAYING DING JUNHUI LIANG WENBO 
HE HAS GOT GREAT PRACTICE ALL THE 
TIME 
I HAVE HAD AN E. MAIL FROM MIC TIME GOLD BUT SAYS DO YOU AGREE THAT 
YOU TRY HAS SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS AND 
MANNERISMS AS A YOUNG STEPHEN 
HENDRY THAT'S PRETTY MUCH A 
COMPLIMENT 
YES I'M SURE IT IS COMPLIMENT IT'S HARD TO THINK BACK TO WHEN 
STEPHEN WAS SEVENTEEN THE IT WAS THE 
SPIKY HAIR PERHAPS THEY ARE 
SIMILARITIES 
YES CERTAINLY LOOKS SIMILARITIES TALL AND SLIM IF YOU'RE GOING TO 
BE COMPARED WITH SOMEONE IT'S NOT 
SO BAD SEVEN TIMES CHAMPION THERE THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER E. MAILS YOU 
HAVE BEEN SENDING IN FOR US AT A 
TIME FOR ONE MORE WHAT IS THE LIFE 
OF A SET OF SNOOKER BALLS 
APPROXIMATELY 
STRANGELY ENOUGH APPROXIMATELY NOT AS LONG AS YOU WOULD THINK 
THEY GO ON FOREVER BUT THEY GET 
WORSE AND WORSE TO SOME DEGREE 
THEY ARE QUITE HIGHLY POLISHED 
ONCE THAT POLISH GOES UP THEY DON'T 
PLAY AS WELL IT'S ADVISABLE TO GET 
THE BALL POLISHED TO THE WHITE 
BALL GET THE BIG FASHION 
DO THEY 
LAST FOR EVER OUR NEW SETS USED 
FOR BIG CHAMPIONSHIPS AT DO THEY 
STORE THEM IN A CUPBOARD AT THE 
CRUCIBLE AND BRING THEM OUT EVERY 
YEAR 
THE THEY USED TO USE OLDER YEAR SETS BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT NEW ONES 
WIN SO GOOD 
THEY ARE ALL 
ELECTRONICALLY SELECTED NOW EVERY 
BALL THAT'S IN THERE IS EXACTLY THE 
SAME WEIGHT SAME SIZE IT'S NOT 
LIKE THE OLD DAYS THE OLD BALLS 
ARE USED TO GO CREAMY THAT'S WHEN 
YOU KNEW THE BALLS WERE NO GOOD 
BECAUSE THEY USED TO START OF 
BRILLIANT WHITE AND THEN GO CREAM 
GET A SET OF BALLS AND TWO OR THREE 
WIDES AND YOU COULD EXTEND THE LIFE 
OF A SET OF BALLS WERE LONG TIME 
BY CHANGING THE WHITE'S EVERY NOW 
AND AGAIN WE'RE INTO FRAME SEVEN 
LIU CHUANG WAS QUITE A WHILE OUT OF 
THE ARENA THERE FIRST TIME AT THE 
CRUCIBLE SO HE PROBABLY HAS TO FIND 
HIS WAY AROUND BACKSTAGE BUT WHAT A FRAME TO TAKE 
HE IS DOING VERY WELL 
I THINK HE 
WENT OUTSIDE TO PERHAPS WIN SOME 
BODY HIS PARENTS AT HOME OR 
SOMETHING AND SAY HE IS THREE TO THREE 
ONLY JOKING HE HAS DONE 
TREMENDOUSLY WELL HERE 
THAT WAS A VERY RISKY ONE TO TAKE 
ON THEIR THAT TYPE OF SHOT IS O. K. 
TAKING ON IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO 
LEAVE ANYTHING BUT THERE WERE A 
COUPLE OF REDS HE COULD HAVE LEFT 
RONNIE IS UNDER IT AT THE MOMENT 
HE COULDN'T PUT THAT DOWN TO LACK 
OF CONCENTRATION L. THINK HE'S JUST 
LOST HIS COMPOSURE A LITTLE BIT 
HERE HE DIDN'T EVEN GET IN THE 
JAWS OF THE POP POCKET 
A RONNIE WAS THREE TO ZERO UP AND WOULD HAVE 
BEEN EXPECTING 
YOUNG LIU CHUANG 
TO BE SITTING IN THE CHAIR A LONG 
TIME AND PERHAPS FIND IT TOO HARD 
TO GET OUT THERE THE YOUNG MAN HAS 
DONE REMARKABLY WELL 
KNOWING THIS YOUNG PLAYER I 
HAVEN'T SEEN HIM BEFORE RONNIE 
MISSING THE LONG RED BUT I THINK 
THIS PLAYER WILL TAKE THE RED ON BANG 
IF YOU PUT A PISTON A BAD THE TABLE 
AND SAID THEY SHOT UP IT WOULD POT 
THE BALL TEN OUT OF TEN THAT'S WHAT 
YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK FOR WITH YOUR 
CUE ACTION 
HE HAS OVERDONE IT THIS TIME END 
OF BREAK 
THAT'S A BIT BETTER BUT THE 
POSITION IS NOT SO GOOD 
ANOTHER GOOD RED ONCE AGAIN NOT 
IN GOOD POSITION 
IT LOOKED A BIT OF A NATURAL RONNI 
FELT HE COULD MISSED THE JAWS OF 
THE POCKET THERE 
THE CROWD WEREN'T EXPECTING THIS 
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE START RONNIE 
MADE IT'S GONE QUIET IN THE 
THEATRE THAT WAS SORT OF LIKE A PLANT 
THAT'S WHAT RONNIE NEEDS NOW A 
COUPLE OF GOOD SAFETY SHOTS AND 
EVENTUALLY A GOOD SAFETY SHOT TO 
FORCED AN ERROR FROM HIS SEVENTEEN YEAR 
OLD OPPONENT 
AM NOT SURE ABOUT THAT SHOT I 
DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO BE TAKING 
THOSE AND TOO OFTEN HE HAD A 
SAFETY SHOT OF ABLE TO HIM AND 
ONCE AGAIN IF IT HAD HAVE BEEN A 
SHOT FOR NOTHING HE COULD HAVE COME 
OFF THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT RED AND 
PLAYED SAFE 
A MORE EXPERIENCED PLAYER WOULD 
PERHAPS TURN A FEW DOWN AT THIS 
STAGE HE HAS GOT RONNIE WORRIED 
HAS HE EVER 
WHAT A CHANCE NOW THEY ARE NICELY 
PLACED FOUR OR FIVE 
POTABLE POSITIONS 
IF YOU'D SAID ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO 
THERE WAS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD CHINESE 
PLAYER ON HIS FIRST TIME AT THE 
CRUCIBLE 
PLAYING THREE TO THREE AGAINST RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN 
ONE GOOD POSITIONAL SHOT HERE COULD 
GET HIM BACK UP THE PINK AND BLACK 
MOST OF THESE YOUNGER PLAYERS LIKE 
THE SHOT WITH A PUNCH THE BALL IN 
YOU DON'T SEE MUCH NOWADAYS OF THE 
OLD BILLIARD STROKE WERE THEY 
PUSHED THEM IN SLOWLY AND THE DROP 
OFF CUSHION IT'S ALL STUN AND 
YES JUST LIKE THAT ONE THERE 
ANOTHER PLAYER THAT LOOKED AS IF HE 
WAS GOING TO KNOCK OUT THE SEVEN 
TIMES FORMER WORLD CHAMPION STEPHEN 
HENDRY A YOUNG PLAYER YOU WORK 
WITH MARK ALAN 
HE IS LIKE THAT HE PUNCHES THEM IN 
YES HE IS GOING TO HAVE HIS TIME 
HERE MARK ALAN ALAN 
THE PINK IS THE EASIER PART BUT THE 
REDS ARE ALL BLOCKING EACH OTHER 
AS LONG AS HE IS NOT STRAIGHT HE 
WILL BE O. K. 
NOW HE HAS GOT AN ANGLE TO GET ON 
THAT ONE THAT I MENTION THAT THE 
BACK THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE RIGHT 
CORNER 
BUT WHEN HE POTS THIS RED IT IS 
GOING TO FREE ANOTHER ONE WHAT A PERFORMANCE THIS WOULD BE 
YOU FANCIED HIM GOING FOUR TO THREE UP WHEN 
HE WAS THREE TO ZERO DOWN DIDN'T YOU 
DENNIS RONNIE HAS STRUGGLED A BIT 
OF LATE 
WE GO BACK TO THAT PINK THAT HE 
MISSED WHETHER IT WAS A LACK OF 
CONCENTRATION IT HAS CERTAINLY 
TURNED THIS MATCH AROUND 
WHEN THE POT IS THINNER THAN IT 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN HE HAS TO MAKE 
SURE THAT THE SPIN IS NOT SO EASY 
TO GET ONTO THE CUE BALL IS HE HARD ENOUGH HE'S NOT 
ANOTHER FEW ROLES WITH THE CUE BALL 
AND HE WOULD HAVE HAD SNOOKER THE BROWN IS A GOOD TARGET 
WHEREAS THE RED GOING WHEREAS THE 
WHITE GOING HAS HE GOT BEHIND THE 
BROWN NO BUT IT STILL WOULD HAVE 
BEEN A SNOOKER IF THAT RED HAD AND 
HAVE COME ACROSS AND OVER THE 
CORNER WHAT A CHANCE FOR RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN 
IT'S BEEN ON THE BLACK AND THE PINK 
IS THE WRONG POTTING ANGLE TO GET 
ON THE REDS A THIN ON THE BLACK THAT'S FINE 
NOT QUITE RIGHT ON THE BLACK HE 
WANTED TO JUST DROP THIS IN 
YOUNG LIU CHUANG WAS JUST A COUPLE 
OF POTS AWAY FROM TAKING THIS FRAME 
NOW HE HAS TO SIT AND WATCH RONNIE 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IS SHOWING HIS 
CLASS HERE HE IS CUEING VERY WELL HERE 
SEE THE SIDE ON THE CUE BALL IT 
MIGHT HAVE FINISHED A BIT AWKWARD PLAYED WELL 
WHAT A FRAME TO TAKE LIU CHUANG 
OPENED WITH BREAK OF FIFTY NINE AND HE 
DIDN'T QUITE GET OUT RED RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN CLEARS UP TO TAKE THE 
FRAME ONE THING WE KNOW FOR SURE 
IS THAT RONNIE O'SULLIVAN KNOWS THE 
WAYS TO THE TOILET UNLIKE LIU 
CHUANG WHO WE FOUND THAT GOT LOST 
ON THE WAY BACK THAT'S WHY HE TOOK 
SO LONG TO COME BACK TO PLAY THAT 
FRAME POOR CHAP 
HE WILL LEARN L. 
CAN'T BELIEVE HE DIDN'T FIND IT 
THERE'S A BIG SIGN OF A MAN ON THE 
DOOR 
A DECENT CHANCE IN A FRIEND DOOR TOO A BIT UNFORTUNATE IN THE END TOO RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IS SO GOOD 
CLEARING UP THE BALLS PROBABLY THE 
BEST WE HAVE HE HAS LET SLIP THIS 
GAME SO HE WILL BE PLEASED TO HAVE 
WON THAT ONE HE WAS AFTER SUCH A 
GREAT START HE WON'T BE TOO HAPPY 
WITH HIMSELF BUT HE'S DONE HIS JOB 
PROPERLY IN THAT FRAME LET'S LET'S ASSESS THE FORM OF RONNIE COMING IN 
HERE HE HAS WON ONE TITLE THE 
UNITED KINGDOM HE'S MADE TWO 
MAXIMUMS AND BEEN THERE OR 
THEREABOUTS ALL SEASON IN TWO WORLD 
RANKING FINALS BUT L. WOULD THINK 
HE WOULD CONSIDER A PRETTY GOOD 
SEASON WOULDN'T YOU 
DIFFICULT TO 
KNOW THE WAY HE THINKS HE SETS 
HIMSELF HIGH STANDARDS BUT I THINK 
THE U. K. AND THE WORLD BUT TWO 
MAJORS ON OUR CIRCUITS OF THE TWO 
THINGS HE DEFINITELY WANTS TO BE 
WINNING EVERY SEASON IF HE CAN BE 
HE HAS WON THE U. K. EARLIER THIS 
SEASON L. FULLY EXPECT HIM TO MAKE 
A BIG EFFORT HERE 
YES HE SEEMS TO 
BE UP FOR IT THAT IS THE KIND OF 
OVERTURES HE WAS MAKING COMING IN 
IT SEEMS HE IS UP FOR THE JOB THIS 
TIME 
YES AND THE LONGER FRAME TIME SESSION SUIT THE BETTER PLAYERS 
YOU WOULD EXPECT HIM TO BE THERE IN 
THE NEXT BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO 
MIND YOUR WORK AGAINST EVERY PLAYER 
THEY'RE ALL GOOD AND CAPABLE LIU LIU CHUANG IS CERTAINLY CAPABLE WE GO 
BACK IN 
THESE ARE VERY FAST MATCH MATCH 
CLOTH AND THE CUE BALL PUSHES INTO 
THE RED HE CAUGHT IT TOO THICK 
YEAH YOU'VE GOT BE SO PRECISE WHEN 
YOU ARE APPLYING SIDE ON THESE 
LIVELY CLOTHS 
MACEY RONNIE O'SULLIVAN S. MIND 
RELEASED AFTER LOSING THAT LAST 
FRAME 
HE HAS LEFT A TOUGH ONE ALONG THE 
CUSHION 
I WAS SURPRISED HE PLAYED FOR THIS 
ONE HE LOOKED TO HAVE A COUPLE OF 
OTHER OPTIONS 
IT'S A SHOT YOU'VE GOT TO PLAY 
DURING THE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
ON A CLUB TABLE THOSE SHOTS ARE 
UNMISSABLE PEOPLE STILL THINK THAT 
THESE TABLES HAVE BIGGER POCKETS 
THAN CLUB TABLES BUT I CAN ASSURE 
YOU THEY HAVEN'T THAT LAST SHOT 
WAS AN INDICATION OF IT 
THAT'S O. K. HE IS ON A RED SLIGHTLY 
AWKWARD BRIDGING L. DON'T KNOW WHAT 
CLUBS YOU GO TO DENNIS GOT BUT 
SOME OF THE OLD WORKING MEN'S CLUB 
YOU COULDN'T PUT ANY BALLS ALONG 
THE BACK CUSHION 
BRIDGING OVER THE 
PACK THERE HE JUST MISJUDGED IT 
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN 
A BIT REACTION FROM HIM WELL 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I THINK HIS CONFIDENCE WAS RESTORED 
AND HE JUST THOUGHT I WOULD GET 
DOWN AND THIS IS AN EASIER ONE TO 
GET ON THE BLACK BUT HE DIDN'T 
EVEN GET THE SCREW ON TO IT BECAUSE 
HE WASN'T ON THE BLACK AS HE 
INTENDED 
HE COULDN'T HAVE PLAYED ANY BETTER 
HE PLAYED SPLIT EARLIER ON AND 
DIDN'T GET MUCH COMING OUT THIS 
TIME IT DIDN'T LOOK TOO GOOD FOR 
A SECOND THERE BUT THEN THAT RED 
HAS COME OFF THE CUSHION AND HE IS 
PERFECT 
AS YOU KNOW ONLY TOO WELL THE 
TOUGHEST ROUND IS THE OPENING ROUND 
AT THE CRUCIBLE THAT'S THE ONE 
WHERE THE TOP PLAYERS ARE 
VULNERABLE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT 
WHEN YOU GET THROUGH THEIR YOU'RE 
IN THE BEST OF THREE SESSIONS 
THIS WILL RESTORE HIS CONFIDENCE IF 
HE CAN KNOCK THIS IN PRETTY GOOD 
I THINK AS STEVE DAVIS SAID YOU 
TALK ABOUT CRUCIBLE NERVES BUT 
THESE PLAYERS PRACTISE SO HARD THAT 
WHEN THEY GET OUT THERE THEY JUST 
LET THEIR TECHNIQUE OVERTAKE 
EVERYTHING 
THE PLAYERS ARE YOUNGER SO THEN 
THEY HAVE SORRY BIT STRONGER 
THEN NERVES ARE BIT STRONGER 
A BRITISH YOUNG PLAYER WOULD BE 
WELL AWARE OF ALL OF THIS WHEREAS 
PERHAPS THE CHINESE PLAYERS ARE NOT 
HAVING THE SAME EFFECT ON THEM TO 
COME TO THE CRUCIBLE 
I SUPPOSE IT IS LIKE OUR PLAYERS 
GOING OVER TO CHINA 
WE CAME HERE AS SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS WELL 
I WAS THIRTY I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU 
WERE 
I WAS HERE IN THE FIRST YEAR WERE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN 
AFTER HE KNOCKED THAT RED INTO THE 
YELLOW POCKET IT HAS BEEN PRETTY 
GOOD STUFF NOW 
NOT BEING A BETTING PERSON I HAVE 
NO IDEA WHAT THE ODDS WERE BEFORE 
THIS MATCH STARTED BUT I THINK YOU 
COULD HAVE GOT QUITE LONG ODDS ON 
THIS YOUNG MAN TAKING FOUR FRAMES 
OF THIS FIRST ROUND MATCH HE IS ON 
HIS WAY TO LEVELLING AT FOUR TO FOUR HE HAS 
A QUICK LOOK AT THE SCOREBOARD A 
LONG WAY TO GO YET THE TWO REDS 
ARE A BIT AWKWARD 
IF HE CAN PICK OFF THE OTHER LOOSE 
ONES HE IS CHECKING TO SEE IF HE 
CAN SCORE ENOUGH WITHOUT HAVING TO 
WORRY ABOUT THE TWO REDS THAT ARE 
TOGETHER 
HE HAS LOST ONE FRAME ALREADY FROM 
HAVING GOOD LEAD 
HE CAN SCORE ENOUGH WITHOUT HAVING 
TO DISTURB THOSE TWO REDS THE ONE 
ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS NOT PERFECTLY 
PLACED AND IF HE HAS FINISHED 
STRAIGHT ON THIS ONE ALONG THE 
CUSHION HE HAS GOT QUITE A BIT OF 
WORK TO DO 
THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF SIDE AND 
THEN LOOKED PRETTY GOOD HE MAY 
HAVE AN ANGLE ON THE GREEN TO STUNT 
UP TOWARDS THAT RED STUN JUST THE RED NEEDED 
THAT WAS THE IMPORTANT ONE VERY 
IMPRESSIVE 
HE NEEDED THAT REALLY 
WHAT HE 
SHOULD HAVE DONE WAS TO POT THE 
BLACK AND FORGET ABOUT THE REDS 
BUT WHAT AN EFFORT FROM THE YOUNG 
MAN 
THAT WAS A LACK OF EXPERIENCE FROM 
THE YOUNG PLAYER IF HE POTTED THE 
BLACK AND FORGOT ABOUT THE TWO REDS 
COME UP RONNIE WOULD HAVE CONCEDED 
BUT WHEN HE TRIED TO DEVELOP THE 
REDS RONNIE CAME OUT OF HIS SEAT 
WRONG CHOICE 
ONE SNOOKER TO TIE AND HE HAS GOT 
THE SNOOKER YOU WOULD EXPECT HIM 
TO ESCAPE FROM IT OFF THE SIDE 
CUSHION 
HE IS COMING TO LOOK AT THE ANGLE 
HE HAS GOT TO BE CAREFUL 
THAT SPOILED IT A BIT OF A 
MISJUDGMENT 
FRAME CONCEDED THAT MISJUDGMENT THAT WAS VERY GENTLEMANLY I SUPPOSE 
WHAT A FRAME FOR THE 
YOUNG PLAYER 
TO TAKE THIS IS TERRIFIC STUFF 
RONNIE LOOKED TO BE BACK IN GOOD 
FORM AND THERE WAS LITTLE STAGE 
IN THE MATCH WHERE HE STARTED A 
MISSING A FEW 
IN THE MATCH WHERE HE STARTED A MISSING A FEW 
HE STARTED MISSING 
WE CAN SHOW YOU A LITTLE MONTAGE OF 
THE MISSES 
NOT A STRAIGHTFORWARD POT AND THIS 
WAS TOUGH L. DIDN'T THINK HE PLAYED 
FOR THIS RED BUT THIS WAS THE ONE 
THERE WAS RED OVER THE POCKET BUT 
RONNIE WANTED TO KNOCK IT IN AND 
GET ON THE BLACK THE THE FINAL FRAME OF THE SESSION 
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN FOUR TO FOUR 
I DIDN'T TO BE 
HONEST I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN TOO BIG AND ASK FOR THIS YOUNG 
MAN AN ASK 
EVEN AT THE START NO ONE THOUGHT 
HE WOULD BE IN THIS POSITION BUT 
AT THREE TO ZERO BEHIND A MARVELLOUS 
PERFORMANCE 
THAT WAS A TERRIFIC SHOT LOTS OF 
SIGHT IT LOOKED COMFORTABLE POT ON THE BROWN SIDE 
THIS FIRST ROUND THIS FIRST ROUND 
MATCH WILL COMMENCE TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON AND IT WILL BE EXCITING 
STUFF 
SOME OF THE FIRST ROUND MATCHES 
FINISH ON THE MORNING SESSION AND 
EVENING SESSION HE HAS MISSED IT AGAIN 
ONCE THEY LEAVE THE CUSHION THERE 
IS NO WAY THEY WILL GOING I I MENTIONED A EARLIER HE IS NOT 
STRIKING THE BALL AS WELL AS HE 
NORMALLY DOES 
I DON'T THINK HE IS ON IT IT WAS A 
THIN CUT AND HE HAD TO BRING THE 
CUE BALL UP PAST THE RED WITH A 
FRACTION OF MORE PACE AND HE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN O. K. IF HE HAD NUDGED THAT 
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT ON THE 
BLACK 
THERE IS A SHOT ON HERE HE BLACK CANNOT HIT THE YELLOW BUT IF HE 
PLAYS IT WITH LEFT HAND SIDE AS 
YOU LOOK AT IT IT WILL TURN LET'S 
HAVE A LOOK TO SEE HOW THIS 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE HAD TO PUT 
THE SIDE ON IT BUT AGAINST THE 
CLOTH IF YOU PUT LEFT HAND SIDE 
THE BALL GOES TO THE RIGHT IF 
YOU'RE GOING THE OTHER WAY FROM THE 
D. AREA UP THE TABLE IT GOES TO THE 
RIGHT 
ANOTHER HALF CHANCE 
YOU WOULD 
EXPECT HIM TO KNOCK THE RED IN 
I THINK HE SETTLED FOR THAT 
THE THE CONFIDENCE OF YOUTH SO REFRESHING THE ONE TO THE LEFT OF THE BLACK 
WOULD BE BETTER IT WOULD CLEAR THE 
BLACK BUT IT HAS GONE A LITTLE BIT 
TOO FAR HE HAS GOT ONE INTO THE 
MIDDLE POCKET BUT HE CANNOT GET 
ONTO THE BLACK BECAUSE IT IS ONLY 
AVAILABLE INTO ONE CORNER L. CAN'T 
SEE A COLOUR OF THAT ONE INTO THE 
MIDDLE POCKET 
IF HE HAS GOT A 
SLIGHT ANGLE HE CAN PUNCH IT IN 
THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT 
BUT WHAT A POT 
IS HE ON THE PINK 
HE HAS KNOCKED IT IN IS HE ON THE 
PINK IT DOESN'T LOOK FROM THE 
OVERHEAD SHOT BUT MAYBE WITH A 
LITTLE TOUCH OF SIDE HE CAN POT IT 
NO THAT IS VERY TIGHT BUT 
SOMETIMES YOU CAN MAKE A POTTING 
ANGLE IF YOU PLAY WITH LEFT HAND 
SIDE 
HE PLAYED A SAFETY SHOT GETTING 
TOO EXCITED IN THE COMMENTARY BOX 
HE PLAYED A GREAT SHOT OF THE BLUE 
FOR THAT RED HE WAS LOOKING LIKE 
HE WOULD HAVE PLAYED WITH SIDE AS 
WELL IN A WAY HE WAS UNFORTUNATE 
NOT TO HAVE A BETTER ANGLE ON THE 
RED IN THE MIDDLE 
HE SEEMS CONFIDENT HE CAN CLEAR UP 
IF HE GETS THE CHANCE 
I DON'T KNOW 
ABOUT YOU BUT I'M ENJOYING EVERY 
MINUTE OF THIS MATCH IT IS GREAT 
TO SEE SOMEONE LIKE RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN COMPETING AGAINST THE 
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD FIRST TIME AT THE 
CRUCIBLE IT IS FASCINATING TO SEE 
HOW IT IS PLANNING OUT AND THERE 
IS A LITTLE PLANT AS WELL WE HAVE 
HAD EVERYTHING HOT EVERYTHING 
BUT WHY NOT A LITTLE PLANT HE IS 
NOT ON THE BLACK THOUGH 
A LITTLE SHAKE OF THE HEAD HE WAS 
NOT TOO HAPPY 
HE HAD HIS GAME AGAINST O'SULLIVAN 
IN CHINA AND I THINK THAT WOULD 
HAVE HELPED HIM IF HE HAD NEVER 
PLAYED RONNIE BEFORE AND CAME HERE 
IT MAY HAVE BEEN END OF TOO MUCH TO 
HANDLE A LITTLE TOO MUCH 
HE HAS 
GOT RONNIE AT IT A LITTLE BIT 
BECAUSE SOME OF HIS SAFETY SHOTS 
HAVE BEEN PRETTY POOR 
IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE CRUCIBLE 
CROWD YOU WILL SEE SOME 
DISBELIEVING FACES 
THEY HAD COME TO SEE RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN PLAY THEY ARE ALL 
FASCINATED AND I AM SURE THEY ARE 
ENJOYING EVERY MINUTE 
OF IT SOME SOME OF THEM HAVE THEIR LITTLE GREEN EARPIECES 
IF I WAS SAT OUT THERE I WOULD 
HAVE US TURNED DOWN OR OFF 
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF 
THAT IS A NEW 
INNOVATION 
THEY CAN HAVE THEIR EARPIECES AND 
LISTEN TO B. B. C. COMMENTARY 
NO PROBLEM TO KNOCK ONE ALONG THE 
CUSHION BUT HE IS THE ONE WITH 
CONFIDENCE 
IF HE DOES TAKE THIS FRAME THERE 
WOULD NOT BE ANY POINT IN TRYING TO 
WRING YOUR COUSIN IN CHINA BECAUSE 
THE LINES WILL BE BUSY WITH ALL THE 
PRESS THAT BORROW FOR WITH THESE 
LADS THAT ARE OVER 
THEY HAVE ALREADY SEEN DING JUNHUI 
HAVE A WIN AGAINST MARCO FU AND 
THEY HAVE STILL GOT A LIANG WENBO 
AGAINST KEN DOHERTY 
YOU CAN HEAR A PIN DROP AT THE 
MOMENT IN THE CRUCIBLE 
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE 
POSSIBLY HE COULD SEE GOING TO 
TOMORROW'S SESSION FIVE TO FOUR LEAD STARING HIM IN THE FACE 
IN THE SEVENTH FRAME THE QUESTION WAS 
ASKED OF RONNIE O'SULLIVAN THE 
QUESTION HAS BEEN ASKED AGAIN CAN 
YOU REPEAT THAT IN THE FINAL FRAME 
OF THIS SESSION ONE DIFFICULT RED 
HE WAS GOING TO PLAY FOR THE BLUE 
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER SHOT ON IF HE 
PLAYS FOR THE BLACK HE CAN 
DISLODGED A DIFFICULT RED THAT IS 
A PRETTY GOOD CHOICE THAT HE IS 
LOOKING AT NOW DISLODGE 
HE IS NOT GOING TO PLAY FOR IT THIS 
TIME BUT HE WILL EVENTUALLY BUT 
HE HAS GONE THE WRONG SIDE OF THE 
BLUE 
IT IS NOT THE INCH PERFECT STUFF WE 
ARE NORMALLY USED TO WITH RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN A LITTLE TOO HARD IT IS IT NO I 
THINK HE CAN CUT IT IN IT IS A 
VERY THIN ONE 
THIS STRETCH WAS ENOUGH TO PUT HIM 
OFF HE WAS A BIT RELUCTANT TO TAKE 
THE REST OUT O. K. HE HAS NOT LEFT 
THE GREEN BUT HE WAS FULLY 
STRETCHED 
MY CAT THE TOTAL POINTS JUST FOUR 
SEPARATE THEM LOOK AT JUST THE PINK NEEDED 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN LED THREE TO ZERO THE 
YOUNG CHINESE PLAYER CAME BACK TO 
DRAW LEVEL AND IT LOOKED AS IF HE 
WAS GOING TO WIN THE SECOND FIVE TO FOUR 
BUT RONNIE HAS DONE IT AND HE GOES 
IN AT FIVE TO FOUR BUT WELL PLAYED TO BOTH 
PLAYERS PLAYERS WE HAVE GOT AGAIN 
HERE RONNIE AND LIU CHUANG WILL 
COME BACK TOMORROW TO FINISH THE 
MATCH 
MATCH L. AM SURE THE YOUNG FELLOW 
FROM CHINA WILL HAVE A LOT TO THINK 
ABOUT HE HAS NOT DISGRACED HIMSELF 
ON HIS DEBUT TO ROUND UP EVENTS ON 
TABLE TWO SHAUN MURPHY THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
CHAMPION FROM YORKSHIRE WAS 
GUARANTEED PLENTY OF LOCAL SUPPORT 
AS HE WAS LAST NIGHT IN THE FIRST 
SESSION BECAUSE VERY DAPPER LOOK 
AT THIS HE HAS GOT A NEW OUTFIT 
THE SPARKLY SEQUINS ON THE LAKE AND 
AROUND THE POCKET ON THE WAISTCOAT 
CERTAINLY NOT OFF THE PACK OFF 
THE PEG IT HAD THE DESIRED EFFECT 
BECAUSE HE TAKE HE TOOK A SEVEN TO TWO 
LEAD AGAINST DAVE HAROLD FROM STOKE 
HE CAME BACK TODAY TO RUN THIS ONE 
OFF BY TEN TO THREE FORTUNATELY THIS 
MATCH WAS A LOT QUICKER THAN THE 
ONE MAIN REASON BE PLAYED IN CHINA 
WHERE SHAUN MURPHY AND THEY'VE 
PRODUCED A WORLD RECORD BETWEEN 
THEM THEY PRODUCED THE LONGEST 
FRAME IN PROFESSIONALS MICHIE 
PROFESSIONAL SNOOKER HISTORY NINETEEN 
MINUTES AND TWELVE SECONDS LONG 
SOMETHING TO REMEMBER OR FORGET I 
AM NOT 
SURE IT 
HE WILL PLAY ALI 
CARTER IN ROUND TWO THERE IS THE 
CUSTOMARY THROWING AWAY OF THE TALK 
SHAUN MURPHY HAS MANAGED TO COME IN 
HERE AND HE IS AMONG THE BOYS AT 
THE TABLE BECAUSE UP THERE IS OUR 
FRIEND M. C. ROB WALKER NICE TO SEE 
YOU HERE BETTER LATE THAN NEVER 
HE DID HAVE A GOOD EXCUSE IN LAS 
VEGAS FOR THE JOE COLE THEY DEFIED 
VEGAS TO SHEFFIELD BUT IT DOESN'T 
GET MORE UNUSUAL THAN THAT BUT THE 
ATMOSPHERE IS AS GOOD AS YOU SAY IT 
IS WITH ME IS SHAUN MURPHY THE 
LOCAL HERO UNIT PRETTY COMFORTABLE 
COOL AND RELAXED 
I WAS JUST GLAD I 
PLAYED HALF DECENT WITH THOSE 
TROUSERS ON IF I DIDN'T PLAY WELL 
I WOULD HAVE LOOK AN IDIOT I THINK 
YOU HAD A QUESTION ABOUT 
CONSISTENCY FOR 
THE BIG MAN WITH WITH THE CURRENT CROP OF TODAY'S PLAYERS 
COMPETITION IS SO HIGH WHAT MAKES 
YOU SO CONSISTENT 
I'M NOT REALLY 
SURE ADJUSTING TO HAVE MANAGED TO 
STRING MORE WINS TOGETHER THAN MOST 
OF THE OTHER PLAYERS I JUST SEEN 
I HAVE DONE A LOT OF LEARNING L. 
WON THE TITLE IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE BUT I DON'T 
GO FOR THOSE STUPID SHOTS ANYMORE 
THAT USED TO HAND OPPONENTS EASY 
CHANCES THAT IS ABOUT IT 
I THINK 
YOU WANTED TO FIND OUT ABOUT A 
PARTICULARLY GOOD YEAR FOR THIS MAN 
WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO WIN THE TITLE 
IT WAS LIKE CHANGING IT WAS 
DREAM COME TRUE SOMETHING I HAVE 
WORKED FOR SINCE I WAS A CHILD L. 
STARTED PLAYING AT EIGHT I GOT A 
LITTLE TABLE AT CHRISTMAS AND I 
WANTED TO BE WORLD CHAMPION TO WIN 
AT A YOUNG AGE WAS FANTASTIC BY 
STEVE'S RECKONING I HAVE GOT 
ANOTHER TWENTY YEARS TO WIN ANOTHER ONE 
IF I AM HERE AT HIS AGE OF UP 
WILL BE HAPPY 
I WANTED TO LAST 
ABOUT YOUR PRACTICE REGIME THE 
FIRE WATCH ANY OF THE AMATEURS 
THEY SET THE BALL UP AND POT AS 
MANY AS THEY CAN IS THAT WHAT IT 
IS LIKE FOR THE PROFESSIONALS MY MY PRACTICE HAS CHANGED AS WELL L. 
USED TO DO A LOT OF HOURS EVERY DAY 
NOW IT IS GEARED AROUND WHAT 
HAPPENS IN MATCHES IF I AM 
STRUGGLING WITH REST PLAYER SAFETY 
PLAY I WILL TEND TO WORK WITH THAT 
IN TODAY'S BUILDING UP TO A 
TOURNAMENT 
HE PLAYED YOU A COUPLE TOURNAMENT OF YEARS AGO OBVIOUSLY YOU WON 
BUT HE WANTS ADVICE FOR THESE 
PLAYERS WHAT WAS IT LIKE 
IT WAS 
TOUGH THAT IS WHAT YOU GET PLAYING 
THE WORLD CHAMPION DO YOU HAVE ANY 
ADVICE FOR YOUNG PLAYERS COMING 
THROUGH INTO THE GAME 
WITH THE 
GUYS YOU ARE WATCHING ON THE 
TELEVISION NOW THE BIGGEST POT OF 
THE GAME IS SCORING YOU HAVE GOT 
TO POT HEAVILY WHEN YOU GET MY 
CHANCES AND THAT IS WHY YOU NEED TO 
SPEND YOUR TIME WORKING ON MAKING 
BREAKS 
YOU HAVE HAD FROM THE BREAKS MASTER WHERE DID THE IDEA COME 
FROM FOR THOSE TROUSERS YOU GRABS 
ME AND SAID I HAVE GOT SOMETHING A 
BIT SPECIAL TONIGHT L. L. HAD TO GET 
THE SUNGLASSES OUT THEY WERE 
SUPERB 
I WENT TO SEE STRICTLY COME SUPERB DANCING WITH WILLIE THORNE ADDED 
CHANGED MY LIFE L. SAW THEM AND I 
THOUGHT I HAVE GOT TO GET THOSE 
THE TAYLOR SAID NO PROBLEM AND WE 
HAVE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR A FEW 
MONTHS 
MY MUM BOUGHT ME A NEW SUIT MONTHS BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LOOK SMART 
NEXT TO THIS MAN 
WITH ALL THE 
INSPIRATION OF STRICTLY COME 
DANCING FANCY A QUICK APPEARANCE 
SUNDAY 
IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC WE SUNDAY WE WILL PUT THE WORD BEEN WITH WILLIE 
THORNE AND DENNIS TAYLOR THEY HAVE 
CONTACTS CONTACTS WE ARE GOING TO CONCENTRATE ON A 
FELLOW WHO WON THIS TITLE IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
KEN DOHERTY FROM IRELAND HE ALWAYS 
ENTERTAINS AT THE TABLE AND HIS 
DISTINCTIVE LAUGH CAN BE HEARD AND 
IDENTIFIED FROM ANYWHERE IN THE 
BUILDING SINCE HE HAS BEEN COMING 
HERE HE HAS HAD MUCH TO SMILE 
ABOUT IT TOOK HIM FOUR YEARS TO 
REACH THE QUARTER FINALS AND ONLY 
SIX TO WIN THE TITLE WHEN HE 
OVERTOOK STEPHEN HENDRY IN THE 
FINAL HE HAD ANOTHER GREAT CHANCE 
IN TWO THOUSAND THREE ONLY TO BE DENIED BUT LAST 
YEAR HE FELL AT THE FIRST HUDDLE 
AGAINST MARK ALLEN AND HE IS 
FACING ANOTHER ROCKY THIS TIME IN 
CHINA'S LIANG WENBO ROOKIE 
WELL LIANG WAS VERY CALM WHEN THEY 
CAME OUT THIS MORNING FOR THEIR 
OPENING SESSION AS WE JOIN IT HE 
HAS TAKEN A HEALTHY THREE TO ONE LEAD WE 
JOIN THEM IN FRAME FIVE LIANG IS 
TO PLAY AND TRAILING BY TWENTY SEVEN POINTS 
WATCHING NEAL FOULDS AND WILLIE 
THORNE 
HE HAS TO AVOID THE CANNON ON BAULK 
COLOURS WHEN PLAYING AT PACE 
IT IS AMAZING HOW BIG THOSE BAULK 
COLOURS ARE ISN'T IT 
NOTHING WRONG WITH THE POT JUST A 
BIT UNLUCKY TO TAKE HIS FULL BALL 
ONTO THE GREEN OTHERWISE HE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN ON SOMETHING BETTER HE 
HAS LOOKED AT THE GROUND WHICH I 
THINK IS TOO THIN TO PLAY AT THE 
BROWN THIS IS QUITE AN IMPORTANT 
FRAME FOR BOTH PLAYERS HE IS AGAIN 
LOOKING AT THE BROWN IT IS A THIN 
CUT THE CUE BALL IS GOING TO 
TRAVEL HE IS NOT FRIGHTENED TO 
PLAY THE SHOTS 
IF THE RED GOES IN THE CENTRE HE'S 
BEEN VERY FORTUNATE 
YES YOU'D LIKE TO BUY A FEW OF 
THOSE CASES HE HAD THERE THAT WAS 
UNBELIEVABLE THOSE KISSES HE IS 
NOW IN PERFECT POSITION TO YOU 
WOULD HAVE TO SAY PINCH A FRAME 
WHERE THE BALLS WERE KEN SHOULD 
HAVE WON THIS 
IT IS LOOKING VERY OMINOUS FOR 
DOHERTY TO BE HONEST 
YES HE 
COULDN'T QUITE COME TO GRIPS WITH 
THE TABLE IN THAT FIFTY BREAK HE GOT 
OUT OF POSITION ABOUT THREE TIMES 
STILL GOT TO DO THIS BUT IT IS 
REALLY A WONDERFUL CHANCE 
THIS THE ONLY DIFFICULT SHOT HE IS 
GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY HE IS NOT 
ABOUT TO GET ONTO THE GREEN EASILY 
HE IS NOT BOUND HE HAS PLAYED TO HOLD IT 
THIS IS THE SHOT IF HE POTS THIS 
HE IS SURE TO WIN THE FRAME 
IT LOOKS O. K. A LITTLE STRAIGHT BUT 
I THINK HE HAS GOT A SLIGHT ANGLE HE NEEDS THE PINK WELL WHAT A MATCH THIS COULD BE A VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE 
KEN DOHERTY HAD A BREAK OF FIFTY 
WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO 
WIN THE FRAME IT WASN'T HE LOST 
POSITION AND MISSED AN EASY POT HE 
NOW TRAILS BY FOUR TO ONE 
YES NOT COMFORTABLE FOR KEN 
DOHERTY FOUR TO ONE BECAME SIX TO TWO IT IS 
WORTH POINTING OUT THAT LIANG WENBO 
IS WORLD RANKED SIXTY SIX AND HAS BEATEN A 
TOUGH COMPETITOR IN IAN MCCULLOCH 
IN THE FINAL QUALIFYING ROUND TO BE 
HERE WE ARE HEADING INTO THE FINAL 
FRAME OF THE SESSION LIANG IS 
AHEAD BY FOUR POINTS 
HE HAS BEEN FORTUNATE WE THINK 
AND BLOCKED THE POCKET AGAIN YOU 
GET THE FEELING THIS IS A MASSIVE 
FRAME AND BOTH PLAYERS KNOW IT AT 
SEVEN TO TWO YOU WOULDN'T REALLY FANCY KEN 
TO COME BACK AT SIX TO THREE HE HAS SOME 
SORT OF CHANCE OVERNIGHT L. SAY 
OVERNIGHT BUT IT ACTUALLY 
COMPLETES THIS EVENING BUT SEVEN 
TWO THAT IS A MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB 
IF HE LOSES THIS FRAME 
KEN HAD NO SHOT AND COULDN'T GET 
BACK INTO BAULK 
I THINK HE PLAYED THAT WITH MORE 
TOP SPIN THAN THE ONE HE MISSED 
EARLIER GREAT SHOT AN ABSOLUTELY 
TOP NUDGE ON THE BLUE IT WAS A 
GREAT POT HE HAS HAD THE BEST OF 
THE LUCK IN THE MATCH BUT HE HAS 
PLAYED BY FAR THE BETTER OF THE TWO 
PLAYERS SO YOU GET WHAT YOU 
DESERVE 
THE ONLY REASON I COULD THINK IS 
THAT THE BLACK MUST POT THERE IS 
NO WAY IN THE WORLD HE WOULDN'T 
HAVE PLAYED THE KISS IN THE REDS IF 
THE BLACK IS NOT ON IF THE BLACK 
DOESN'T POT I WILL BE AMAZED 
HE'D HAVE HAD TO PLAY IT INTO THE 
BUNCH TO FREE THE PINK IF THE BLACK 
DIDN'T POT BUT IT IS O. K. STILL GOT 
TO GO INTO THEM AND HE IS NOT 
NECESSARILY GOING TO WIN THE FRAME 
AT THIS VISIT 
I AM SURPRISED THAT WENT IN WE SAW 
A SHOT EARLIER BACK LOOKED EVEN 
CLOSER THAN THIS ONE AND DIDN'T 
DROP IN A SHOT EARLIER THAT 
LOOKED EVEN CLOSER 
THIS TIME HE WILL GO INTO THEM 
SAYING THAT HE HAS GOT ONE 
STICKING OUT YOU COULD PLAY UP ON 
THAT LOOSE ONE BUT THIS COULD BE 
AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY 
HE HAS PLAYED IT THAT IS A GOOD 
SHOT THAT REALLY IS 
OH THE SPIN ON THE WHITE A LOT OF 
THESE YOUNG PLAYERS CAN PLAY THAT 
SHOT AND THEY DO WIN PLENTY OF 
FRAMES WHEN THEY CAN GET REACTION ON THE BALL LIKE THAT 
WHEN HE CAME INTO THAT AUDITORIUM 
THIS MORNING HE WAS AN UNKNOWN 
PLAYING AGAINST ONE OF THE GAME'S 
GREAT PLAYERS KEN DOHERTY HE HAS 
MADE KEN LOOK VERY ORDINARY TODAY 
ALBEIT KEN HAS LOOKED NOWHERE NEAR 
HIS BEST THE SAFETY HAS BEEN VERY 
POOR HIS SAFETY IS DOWN AT EIGHTY PER CENT 
AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO BE WELL 
PAST NINETY PER CENT TO HAVE ANY CHANCE IN 
PROFESSIONAL SNOOKER KEN HAS 
CLIMBED A FEW MOUNTAINS IN HIS LIFE 
HE WILL HAVE TO CLIMB A VERY BIG 
ONE THIS EVENING TWO REDS TWO COLOURS 
NO FLUKE ABOUT THIS HE HAS PLAYED 
WELL FROM THE START 
A LOT OF PLAYERS ON THEIR FIRST 
TIME AT THE CRUCIBLE HAVE A FEW 
JITTERS IN THEIR FIRST SESSION HE 
LOST THE FRAME BUT HE WAS QUICKLY 
INTO IT AFTER THAT LOST THE 
FIRST FRAME WE COULD BE IN FOR 
REAL TURN UP LATER TODAY A REAL 
TURN UP THE TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD CHINESE 
PLAYER LOOKS UP TO THE JOB TO ME L. 
DON'T THINK HE WILL STRUGGLE TO GET 
OVER THE LINE IF THAT CHANCE COMES 
HIS WAY I GET THE FEELING HE IS 
GOING TO TAKE IT HE HAS A GREAT 
TEMPERAMENT THIS FRAME IS OVER 
THERE HE IS KEN DOHERTY WITH A 
LOT TO THINK ABOUT 
YES THIS IS HIS EIGHTH BREAK OVER FORTY 
IF YOU CAN GUARANTEE YOU MAKE A FORTY 
BREAK EVERY FRAME YOU PLAY YOU 
HAVE THE CHANCE OF BEING WORLD 
CHAMPION BUT OF COURSE YOU CAN'T 
GUARANTEE THAT VERY IMPRESSED 
NO CENTURY BREAK TODAY AND HE 
CAN'T GET ON HERE BUT WHEN YOU 
KEEP KNOCKING IN FORTY OR ABOVE IT 
BRIGHTENS YOUR OPPONENT THINK 
THAT IS WHAT IT HAS DONE TO KEN 
TODAY HE IS BIT LIKE RABBIT IN 
HEADLIGHTS HE HAS FOUND SOMETHING 
TOTALLY UNEXPECTED HE WAS NOT 
EXPECTING THIS MAN TO COME OUT HERE 
AND PLAY LIKE THIS AND NOR WERE WE 
PEOPLE FROM ROUND THE WORLD MAYBE 
HAVE NEVER HEARD OF LIANG WENBO 
BEFORE THERE IS ONE THING FOR 
CERTAIN THEY HAVE HEARD OF HIM NOW 
THIS HAS BEEN SESSION OF A TOP 
QUALITY SNOOKER THIS YOUNG MAN HAS 
PROVED HE WILL BE A TOUGH NUT TO 
CRACK FOR ANY PLAYER HE FINISHES 
WITH THE HIGHEST BREAK OF THE MATCH 
SO FAR NINETY FIVE 
NOW THAT IS IMPRESSIVE KEN 
DOHERTY FACES A VERY LONG NIGHT 
THEY ARE GOING TO COME BACK AND 
FINISH THAT HOW WELL GENERALLY DO 
YOU THINK THE TWO CHINESE LADS HAD 
ACQUITTED THEMSELVES TODAY BETTER BETTER THAN POSSIBLY EVERYBODY HERE AND 
ALL THE PUNDITS THOUGHT THEY WOULD 
BUT THEY ARE VERY ACCOMPLISHED 
PLAYERS FURTHER DOWN THE RANKING 
LIST AND COMING THROUGH PERHAPS AT 
THE JUBILANT OF YOUTH AND NO FEAR 
HOW WORRYING FOR KEN DOHERTY 
IT IS 
NOT QUITE MISSION IMPOSSIBLE BUT 
IT IS NEARLY THERE SIX TO THREE A BIT OF A 
CHANCE BUT SEVENTY TWO TO HIS MASSIVE HE 
HAS IT ALL TO GET WENBO WOULD HAVE 
TO MISS A FEW BALLS TO STOP THERE 
ARE THREE FIRST ROUND MATCHES STILL 
TO BE COMPLETED 
LET'S REMIND YOU

FOR HIM GETTING FANTASTIC 
TOURNAMENT THAT IS THE MATCH OF 
THE ROUND 
NOT JUST CONCENTRATING 
ON THE PLAYERS WE HAVE PLAYERS OF 
A DIFFERENT KIND SAM TORRANCE 
TEXTED NEED TO SAY HE WAS ENJOYING 
THE COVERAGE AND HE ASKED A 
QUESTION PERTINENT BECAUSE MARK 
ALLEN'S S. LEAD TOUCHED THE BALL AND 
HE WAS FOULED WHY CAN'T YOU PLAY 
IN SHORT SLEEVES ASK SAM 
I'M NOT 
SURE IT IS ONE OF THE ONLY SPORTS 
WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE CLOTHING THAT 
HELPS THE PLAYERS WE ARE AWARE 
BOW TIES WHICH ARE RESTRICTING IF 
YOU DID HAVE SHORT SLEEVES WE 
WOULD SEE MARK WILLIAMS'S TATTOOS 
ECZEMA CROWD GOOD POINT 
IF SAM 
WANTS TO POP UP BUT TICKETS ARE 
HERE 
RAY STUBBS IS BACK ON DUTY HERE TONIGHT AT SEVEN P. M. IT JUST REMAINS TO 
SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY BROTHER 
DAVID BYE FOR NOW 
I AM MISTRESS OF ALL I SURVEY 
YOU THREW YOUR LIFE AWAY BECAUSE HE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND YOUR CLEVER WORDS AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE 
MY CLEVER WORDS WILL SOON BE THE ONLY THING PUTTING A ROOF OVER MY HEAD 
WHAT HAPPINESS I AM ALL ALONE 
OUT OF STEP AND AHEAD OF HER TIME 
THE ONLY WAY TO GET A MAN LIKE MR. DARCY IS TO MAKE HIM UP 
THE UNTOLD STORY OF A GREAT STORYTELLER
