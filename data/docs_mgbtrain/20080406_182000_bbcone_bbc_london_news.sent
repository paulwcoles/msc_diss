TIBET PROTESTS HAVE OVERSHADOWED 
THE OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY THROUGH 
LONDON THE GAMES THEMSELVES COME 
TO THE CAPITAL IN FOUR YEARS' TIME 
WE WENT TO LOOK AT WHAT TODAY'S 
EVENTS MEAN FOR THE OLYMPIC 
MOVEMENT MOVEMENT THE IMAGE OF THE OLYMPICS OF A 
CELEBRATION OF PEACE AND HARMONY 
WAS LOST ON THE STREETS OF LONDON 
TODAY ORGANISERS WANT TO THE TORCH 
RELAY TO GET PEOPLE EXCITED ABOUT 
THE GAMES WANTED NOT ANGRY 
LIKE THIS THIS TORCH RELAY IS 
RAPIDLY BECOMING LESS ABOUT THE 
OLYMPICS AND MORE ABOUT CHINA WHEN 
YOU HOST THE GAMES YOU HOLD UP A 
MIRROR TO YOUR WORLD WHAT AND ALL 
SO WILL THIS MEAN THEY DO SERIOUS 
DAMAGE TO THE IMAGE OF THE 
OLYMPICS 
THE TORCH RELAY IS NOT OLYMPICS TURNING OUT IN THE WAY THE 
CHINESE HAD HOPED FOR AS A GREAT 
PUBLIC RELATIONS BUILD UP TO THE 
GAMES BUT THE MEMORY OF THE GAMES 
WILL NOT BE DEFINED BY THE BUILD UP 
THE MEMORY OF THE GAMES WILL BE 
DEFINED BY THE SEVENTEENTH DAYS OF THE 
GAMES I THINK CHINA WILL STAGE 
POSSIBLY THE GREATEST OLYMPIC GAMES 
EVER 
NEVERTHELESS TRANSPORTING EVER THE TORCH AROUND THE WORLD IS A 
RELATIVELY NEW CONCEPT AND TONIGHT 
OFFICIALS WILL WONDER IF IT IS A 
LIABILITY FOR THE FAMOUS FIVE RINGS 
YOU CAN SEE A SPECIAL PROGRAMME ON 
THE OLYMPIC TORCH IN LONDON
