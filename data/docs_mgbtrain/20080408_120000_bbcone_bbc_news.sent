IN MARCH GORDON BROWN INSISTS 
MEASURES ARE IN PLACE TO HELP 
PROPERTY OWNERS AND THOSE WHO WANT 
TO GET ON TO THE LADDER 
I THINK WE 
ARE SHOWING TODAY BY THE ACTION WE 
ARE TAKING IN THE HOUSING MARKET 
OUR VIGILANCE AND TERMINATION TO BE 
ON THE SIDE OF HOMEBUYERS DETERMINATION DETERMINATION THE SOLE SURVIVOR OF THE CRASH 
WHICH KILLED PRINCESS DIANA SAYS HE 
AGREES WITH YESTERDAY'S INQUEST 
VERDICT VERDICT POLICE INVESTIGATING THE 
DISAPPEARANCE OF SHANNON MATTHEWS 
HAD BEEN GIVEN MORE TIME TO 
QUESTION HER MOTHER 
AS THE OLYMPIC FLAME HAD TO SAN 
FRANCISCO THE OLYMPIC COMMITTEE 
SAYS IT WILL LOOK AT WHETHER THE 
REST OF THE TORCH RELAY SHOULD GO 
AHEAD AHEAD ON B. B. C. LONDON DOZENS OF SUSPECTED 
CASES OF MEASLES FORCES AND ALERT 
IN SOUTH LONDON AND COPYRIGHT FOR 
CARNABY STREET THE COUNCIL IS 
CLAMPING DOWN ON USING ITS WORLD 
FAMOUS SIGNS 
GOOD AFTERNOON THERE IS MORE 
EVIDENCE TODAY THAT THE HOUSING 
MARKET IS FACING ITS BIGGEST 
SLOWDOWN SINCE THE RECESSION OF THE 
NINETEEN NINETIES ACCORDING TO THE COUNTRY'S 
LARGEST MORTGAGE LENDER THE 
HALIFAX HOUSE PRICES SAW THEIR 
BIGGEST MONTHLY FALL SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO 
DROPPING TWENTY FIVE PER CENT WORSE THAN MANY 
EXPERTS HAD PREDICTED EXPERTS SAY 
HOUSE PRICES HAVE STILL RISEN OVER 
THE LAST YEAR BUT AT THEIR SLOWEST 
RATE FOR OVER A DECADE 
IT IS THE BIGGEST MONTHLY FALL FOR 
MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS HOUSE PRICES IN 
MARCH FELL BY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT ACCORDING TO 
THE HALIFAX OVER THE FIRST THREE 
MONTHS OF THE YEAR PRICES ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY ARE DOWN BY ONE PER CENT BUT 
THERE ARE BIG DIFFERENCES IN THE 
WEST MIDLANDS PRICES FELL BY FIVE PER CENT 
BUT THEY WENT UP SIXTEEN PER CENT IN LONDON 
COMPARISONS WITH THE NINETIES CRECHE ARE 
INEVITABLE BUT SOME ARGUE IT IS 
MISLEADING CRASH 
THE ECONOMY 
WAS IN POOR SHAPE INFLATION WAS 
OUT OF CONTROL UNEMPLOYMENT ROSE 
SHARPLY DURING THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES 
MEANING A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE FORCED 
INTO SELLING THEIR PROPERTIES AS 
THEY COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH 
PAYMENTS THAT PUT DOWNWARD 
PRESSURE ON HOUSE PRICES 
ONE BIG 
AREA AFFECTING PRICES IS THE 
MORTGAGE MARKET MANY LENDERS HAVE 
SIMPLY REMOVED THEIR DEALS BEFORE 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH THERE WERE 
ELEVEN THOUSAND OFFERS ON THE TABLE NOW 
DOWN TO BARELY THREE THOUSAND FOR ANYONE 
WITHOUT A DEPOSIT THINGS ARE 
TOUGHER LAST MAY THERE WERE MORE 
THAN ONE HUNDRED DEALS AVAILABLE AFTER 
ABBEY WITHDREW THEIRS YESTERDAY 
NOW THERE ARE NONE BUT IS MAKING 
FINDING A MORTGAGE ARE HARD FOR 
SIMON TULLEY HE WANTS A ONE HUNDRED PER CENT DEAL 
WORTH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT HAS BEEN TOLD 
THAT IS NOW IMPOSSIBLE 
THE NLY 
TWO LENDERS WHO WOULD BE PREPARED 
TO LEND WOULD NEED THE FIVE TO TEN PER CENT 
DEPOSIT WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION 
TO DO THAT WE NEEDED ONE HUNDRED PER CENT THAT 
MEANT WE COULD NOT THEN GO OUT AND 
PURCHASE THE HOUSE WE WERE LOOKING 
TO BUY 
SOME IN THE INDUSTRY SAY 
ANY BANK OF ENGLAND INTEREST RATE 
CUT ON THURSDAY WILL MAKE VERY 
LITTLE DIFFERENCE 
A LOT OF LENDERS 
HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM THE MARKET 
COMPLETELY IF INTEREST RATES WERE 
TO GO DOWN THIS WEEK IT IS LIKELY 
MORTGAGE RATES WILL CONTINUE TO 
CLIMB 
FALLING HOUSE PRICES ARE NOT CLIMB NECESSARILY BAD NEWS FOR ANYONE 
WANTING TO MOVE UP THE PROPERTY 
LADDER IT SHOULD MAKE THINGS 
EASIER EASIER IN THE PAST FEW MINUTES THE PRIME 
MINISTER HAS BEEN TALKING TO NICK 
ROBINSON HE HAS BEEN DEFENDING THE 
GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 
I AM ALWAYS VIGILANT L. THINK THE 
RECORD OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT 
WE HAVE MAINTAINED COURSE OF 
STABILITY ALWAYS AT DIFFICULT 
TIMES 
WHAT MIGHT REASSURE PEOPLE TIMES IS THAT ARE YOU SPECTATORS HOPING 
FOR THE BEST 
WE ARE NOT SPECTATORS 
ARE WE BETTER PREPARED THAN WE WERE 
ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS 
TO DO WHAT 
NOW 
IF YOU LOOK BACK FIFTEEN YEARS THE NOW WORLD DOWNTURN WE HAD FIFTEEN PER CENT 
INTEREST RATES TEN PER CENT INFLATION 
RISING UNEMPLOYMENT PUBLIC 
SPENDING BEING CUT TAXES RISING 
DRAMATICALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THIS 
SITUATION BECAUSE WE HAVE LOW 
INFLATION WE CAN CUT INTEREST 
RATES BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD LOW DEBT 
WE CAN KEEP PUBLIC SPENDING IN LINE 
AND BORROW AT THE RIGHT TIME TO 
HELP THE ECONOMY COME THROUGH 
DIFFICULT TIMES THAT IS WHY PEOPLE 
ARE FORECASTING BRITISH GROWTH WILL 
BE HIGHER THAN GROWTH IN OTHER 
COUNTRIES WHO ARE EQUALLY AFFECTED 
BY WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND THE 
WORLD 
LET'S GET THE LATEST FROM WORLD NICK ROBINSON WHAT WAS YOUR SENSE 
HE SOUNDED QUITE CONFIDENT WHAT IS 
YOUR SENSE OF HOW WORRIED HE MUST 
BE THE LIB DEMS ARE SAYING THE 
WHEELS ARE COMING OF THE 
GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC POLICY HE HE CHOSE TO DO THIS INTERVIEW ON THIS 
DAY WHY BECAUSE HE WANTS TO GET 
THE MESSAGE OF ECONOMIC STABILITY 
THAT HE PUMPED OUT SO OFTEN AS 
CHANCELLOR AND NOW HE'S HAVING TO 
DO ONCE AGAIN AS PRIME MINISTER L. 
SUGGESTED THAT SOME WOULD LISTEN TO 
HIS WORDS AND SAY HE WAS IN DENIAL 
ABOUT THE STATE OF THE BRITISH 
ECONOMY HE INSISTS THAT GIVEN 
THAT HOUSE PRICES HAVE ROCKETED FOR 
YEAR AFTER YEAR IN ITSELF AT TWENTY FIVE 
PER CENT MONTHLY DROP IS NOT A PROBLEM 
THE PROBLEM WOULD BE IF IT CANNOT 
BE CONTAINED WHAT YOU WERE HEARING 
HIM SAY THERE IS WHY HE HOPES AND 
BELIEVES AND MAYBE HE IS CROSSING 
THE ODD THING OR TWO THAT IT CAN 
BE CONTAINED 
CAN IT THAT IS THE 
BIG QUESTION WHAT WOULD HE INTEND 
TO DO NEXT THE ODD FINGER OR TWO 
IT IS LIMITED IT IS NOT UP TO HIM 
WHETHER INTEREST RATES ARE CUT THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND MONETARY POLICY 
COMMITTEE MEETS LATE IN THE WEEK 
AND HE AND OTHERS THINK THERE IS 
LIKELY TO BE A CUT BUT IT IS NOT A 
GOVERNMENT DECISION EVEN IF THOSE 
INTEREST RATES ARE CUT THEY ARE 
NOT NECESSARILY PASSED ON TO THOSE 
OF US PAYING MORTGAGES HE SAYS HE 
AND MINISTERS ARE HAVING MEETINGS 
ABOUT THAT BUT AT THE MOMENT HE 
HAS NOTHING TO PROMISE IN WHAT HE 
CAN DO HE SAYS HE THINKS THERE IS 
A ROLE INTERNATIONALLY HE HAS A 
VISIT TO THE U. S. A. NEXT WEEK TO PUT 
PRESSURE ON FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
AROUND THE WORLD TO ESSENTIALLY 
TELL US THE WORST TO TELL US WHAT 
IS HIDDEN AWAY FROM THEIR BALANCE 
SHEETS THE HUGE DEBTS LEADING TO 
WHAT IS CALLED THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
WHICH FOR YOU AND ME MEANS BANKS 
WILL NOT LEND US MONEY FOR OUR 
HOMES AND BUSINESSES HE HOPES THAT 
IS ONE THING GOVERNMENT CAN DO HE 
DENIES THAT HE IS THE SPECTATOR BUT 
IN TRUTH LIKE US ALL HE IS HAVING 
TO WAIT WATCH AND WORRY 
B. B. C. NEWS 
TWENTY FOUR WOULD HAVE MORE OF THAT 
INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIME MINISTER 
THREW THE AFTERNOON WILL HAVE 
MORE MORE THE ONLY SURVIVOR OF THE CRASH THAT 
KILLED THE PRINCE OF WALES AND DODI 
FAYED SAYS HE HOPES EVERYBODY CAN 
NOW MOVE ON TREVOR REES SAYS HE 
AGREES WITH YESTERDAY'S INQUEST 
VERDICT THAT THE COUPLE WERE 
UNLAWFULLY KILLED TODAY MOHAMED 
AL FAYED WILL BE HAVING FURTHER 
MEETINGS WITH HIS LAWYERS 
HE IS STILL NOT READY IT SEEMS TO 
MOVE AWAY FROM THE CONSPIRACY 
THEORIES HE CREATED EVEN THOUGH 
THEY HAVE NOW BEEN REJECTED BY A 
JURY MOHAMED AL FAYED IS 
CONSULTING HIS LAWYERS AGAIN A 
SPOKESWOMAN SAYS HE IS KEEPING HIS 
OPTIONS OPEN 
THERE IS WHAT HE 
PRIVATELY BELIEVES AS A FATHER AND 
I THINK NOBODY CAN SAY GET OVER 
THE DEATH OF YOUR SON PRINCES 
WILLIAM AND HARRY WILL NOT GET OVER 
THE DEATH OF THEIR MOTHER THE ONLY 
THING THAT NEED CONCERN ANYBODY IS 
WHETHER THERE IS ANY LEGAL REDRESS 
WHETHER ANYTHING WILL BE PLAYED OUT 
IN THE PUBLIC ARENA IT IS UNLIKELY 
THERE WILL BE BUT HE IS KEEPING 
HIS OPTIONS OPEN 
TEN YEARS ON FROM 
DIANA'S DEATH AND AFTER A SIX MONTH 
INQUEST THE PRIME MINISTER HAS 
SAID IT IS TIME TO MOVE ON 
I THINK 
IT IS TIME TO DRAW A LINE PRINCES 
WILLIAM AND HARRY HAD SPOKEN FOR 
THE COUNTRY WHEN THEY HAVE SAID 
THIS IS TIME TO BRING THIS TO AN 
END 
TREVOR REES THE BODYGUARD WHO END WAS THE SOLE SURVIVOR OF THE CRASH 
AND WHO GAVE EVIDENCE TO THE 
INQUEST HAS ISSUED A BRIEF 
STATEMENT 
THAT IS VERY MUCH THE WISH OF 
PRINCES WILLIAM AND HARRY THEY 
HAVE SAID THEY AGREE WITH THE 
VERDICTS AND THEY HAVE INDICATED 
THEY HOPE THIS WILL PUT AN END TO 
ALL THE UNFOUNDED SPECULATION ABOUT 
A MURDER PLOT THE VERDICTS HAVE 
REOPENED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ROLE 
OF THE PAPARAZZI IT SEEMS MOST 
UNLIKELY THE FINDING OF UNLAWFUL 
KILLING WILL LEAD TO ANY 
PROSECUTIONS FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS WHO 
WERE DETAINED THAT NIGHT THE 
FRENCH PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE HAVE 
SAID THAT AS FAR AS THEY ARE 
CONCERNED THERE IS NOTHING NEW 
YET THE VERDICT TO POSE QUESTIONS 
ABOUT THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE PRESS 
PHIL HALL IS A FORMER EDITOR OF THE 
NEWS OF THE WORLD PHOTOGRAPHERS PHOTOGRAPHERS ARE GOING TO OBEY THE LAW BUT IF 
THEY THINK THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH 
IT THEY WILL IT IS DOWN TO 
NEWSPAPER EDITORS TO MAKE SURE THEY 
KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH 
PICTURE WAS TAKEN 
ONE N. WHO 
WILL NOT BE PROSECUTED IS PAUL 
BURRELL HE HAS ADMITTED HE DID NOT

INTERVIEW PROCESS WE ARE TOLD CAN 
LAST FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
THE WATER COMPANY SEVERN TRENT HAS 
BEEN FINED NEARLY THIRTY SIX MILLION BY 
THE WATER REGULATOR OFWAT THAT IS 
FOR DELIBERATELY PROVIDING IT WITH 
FALSE INFORMATION AND FOR POOR 
CUSTOMER SERVICE IT RESULTED IN 
CUSTOMERS PAYING HIGHER BILLS THAN 
THEY SHOULD HAVE SEVERN TRENT 
WHICH HAS ALMOST FOUR MILLION 
CUSTOMERS SAID IT WOULD HAND BACK 
ALMOST ELEVEN MILLION TO COMPENSATE 
CUSTOMERS FOR THE FAILINGS 
A JUDGE HAS RULED THE GOVERNMENT 
ACTED UNLAWFULLY WHEN IT CHANGED 
THE RULES FOR HIGHLY SKILLED 
MIGRANTS WORKING IN THE U. K. IN TWO THOUSAND SIX 
A POINTS SYSTEM BASED ON EDUCATION 
PREVIOUS SALARY AND AGE WAS BROUGHT 
IN OPPONENTS SAY IT MEANT THAT 
FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO CAME TO THE U. K. 
UNDER THE OLD RULES NOW FACE BEING 
DEPORTED DEPORTED THE HIGHLY SKILLED MIGRANTS WHO 
BROUGHT THIS CASE LEFT THE HIGH 
COURT THIS MORNING JUBILANT THE 
JUDGE SIR GEORGE NEWMAN SAID THEY 
WERE TREATED UNFAIRLY AND THE 
GOVERNMENT ABUSED ITS POWER THE 
HIGH COURT SHOULD INTERVENE THE 
JUDGE SAID TO STOP THE GOVERNMENT 
ACTING UNLAWFULLY BY SENDING THESE 
PEOPLE BACK HOME 
IT IS A GREAT 
JUDGMENT IT BASICALLY ENSURES THAT 
MIGRANTS' INTERESTS CANNOT BE 
UNDERMINED JUST TO FULFIL THE 
POLITICAL AMBITIONS OF THE 
GOVERNMENT 
TWENTY TWO DAYS AND COUNTING GOVERNMENT AS SANJEEV PICKS UP HIS DAUGHTER 
FROM SCHOOL THAT IS WHAT IS 
WEIGHING ON HIS MIND THE TWENTY TWO DAISY 
HAS LEFT BEFORE HIS HIGHLY SKILLED 
MIGRANT THESE ARE RUNS OUT AND HE 
AS HIS FAMILY FACE DEPORTATION BACK 
TO INDIA SANJEEV HAS A DEGREE AND 
A GOOD JOB IN IT BUT THAT IS NOT 
GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S 
REVAMPED MIGRANT PROGRAMME 
MIGRANTS NEED TO BE EARNING FORTY THOUSAND 
TO GET ENOUGH POINTS TO RECALL A 
FIGHT WAY OUT OF REACH FOR MOST 
MIGRANTS RE QUALIFIES MIGRANTS 
CAME TO BRITAIN WITH THEIR FAMILIES 
REASSURED BY WHAT THEY TOOK TO BE A 
PROMISE FROM THE GOVERNMENT THAT 
AFTER FOUR YEARS THEY COULD STAY 
FOR GOOD AS LONG AS THEY WERE 
ECONOMICALLY ACTIVE SUCCESSFUL 
APPLICANTS HAD TO SAY THEY WOULD 
MAKE BRITAIN THEIR MAIN HOME 
FORTY NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE CAME TO BRITAIN UNDER 
THE HIGHLY SKILLED MIGRANT 
PROGRAMME AN ESTIMATED FIVE THOUSAND HAVE 
ALREADY GIVEN UP THE FIGHT AND LEFT 
THE COUNTRY THIS IS THE ORIGINAL 
FORTY PAGE GUIDANCE DOCUMENT FROM THE 
HOME OFFICE IF YOU TURN TO THE 
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION IT 
ASKS HOW DO THE CHANGES AFFECT ME 
THE ANSWER NOT AT ALL THOSE WHO 
HAVE ALREADY ENTERED ONTO THE 
PROGRAMME WILL BE ALLOWED TO STAY 
AND AFTER FOUR YEARS APPLIED FOR 
SETTLEMENT REGARDLESS OF REVISIONS 
I AM SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION 
BECAUSE I GET NIGHTMARES MY WIFE 
IS SO UPSET MY CHILDREN ARE SO 
UPSET 
THE IMMIGRATION MINISTER UPSET LIAM BYRNE SAID HE BELIEVES THE 
GOVERNMENT DID GIVE MIGRANTS ENOUGH 
WARNING THE RULES COULD GET TOUGHER 
WHILE THEY ARE HERE THE GOVERNMENT 
IS CONSIDERING WHETHER TO SEEK 
LEAVE FOR APPEAL 
THE SEVEN PEOPLE ON HOLIDAY WITH 
KATE AND GERRY MCCANN WHEN THEIR 
DAUGHTER MADELEINE DISAPPEARED ARE 
TO BE QUESTIONED BY POLICE THE 
INTERVIEWS WILL BE CARRIED OUT BY 
BRITISH DETECTIVES BUT PORTUGUESE 
OFFICERS WILL ALSO BE THERE 
ROBERT HALL IS AT LEICESTERSHIRE 
POLICE HEADQUARTERS IS THE PROCESS 
UNDER WAY THEN 
YES IT HAS KATE 
THE PORTUGUESE TEAM LED BIT SENIOR 
INVESTIGATOR PAULO REBELO ARRIVED 
HERE AT NINE THIRTY A M. THIS MORNING 
LEICESTERSHIRE POLICE HAVE BEEN 
FERRYING THEM IN UNMARKED VEHICLES 
WITH BLACKED OUT WINDOWS THE SAME 
PROCEDURE BEING FOLLOWED WE 
BELIEVE FOR WITNESSES ARRIVING 
THIS MORNING THE FIRST OF THOSE 
WAS JANE TANNER SHE HAS TRAVELLED 
UP FROM HER HOME IN EXETER WITH HER 
PARTNER SHE WAS DUE TO BEGIN HER 
INTERVIEW MID MORNING 
LEICESTERSHIRE POLICE ARE ASKING A 
LIST OF QUESTIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY 
BEEN SUBMITTED THE PORTUGUESE 
POLICE WITH THEIR TRANSLATORS ARE 
ACT AS OBSERVERS KATE AND GERRY 
MCCANN ARE NOT ON THAT LIST THEY 
SAID THEY WERE WILLING TO BE 
INTERVIEWED THE PORTUGUESE POLICE 
DON'T REQUIRE THEM THIS TIME AROUND 
WHEN I SPOKE TO CLARENCE MITCHELL 
WHO LOOKS AFTER THE MCCANNS' MEDIA 
INTEREST HE TOLD ME THAT THE 
COUPLE WERE GRATEFUL THE PORTUGUESE 
WERE CONDUCTING THIS LENGTHY REVIEW 
OF EVIDENCE 
THEY HOPE AS DO THEIR 
FRIENDS THEY WILL REALISE THERE IS 
NOTHING IN WHAT THE FRIENDS HAVE 
SAID IN THE PAST THAT IN ANY WAY 
WILL LEAD TO ANYBODY BEING 
INCRIMINATED KATE AND GERRY WERE 
NOT INVOLVED IN 
MADELEINE'SAPPEARANCE THEY HOPE 
THE POLICE WILL REALISE THIS A 
AFTER THIS VISIT AND THEIR ARGUIDA 
STATUS SHOULD BE LIFTED 
ROBERT I UNDERSTAND THAT KATE AND 
GERRY MCCANN ARE LAUNCHING ANOTHER 
INITIATIVE TO FIND MADELEINE THEY THEY ARE THEY'RE OFF TO BRUSSELS 
TOMORROW EVENING THEY WILL MEET 
MEPS WITH A PRESENTATION ON 
THURSDAY MORNING IT'S ALL ABOUT A 
SYSTEM CALLED AMBER ALERT IT 
EXISTS IN THE UNITED STATES IT'S A 
WAY OF GETTING INFORMATION OUT 
THERE QUICKLY IF A CHILD GOES 
MISSING THE HOPE IS THAT MEPS WILL 
SIGN UP TO IT AND IT CAN CAN BECOME 
PART OF EUROPEAN LEGISLATION OR AT 
LEAST A EUROPE WIDE AGREEMENT 
ALONGSIDE THAT THE FAST 
APPROACHING FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF 
MADELEINE'S DISAPPEARANCE WE 
UNDERSTAND TODAY THE PORTUGUESE ARE 
CONSIDERING SOME FORM OF 
RECONSTRUCTION THE DATES TO BE 
CONFIRMED THE DETAILS STILL VERY 
SKETCHY AND CERTAINLY THE MCCANNS' 
INVOLVEMENT STILL UNCERTAIN 
ROBERT THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
OUR TOP STORY 
THERE ARE MORE CONCERNS ABOUT THE 
HOUSING MARKET THE HALIFAX SAYS 
HOUSE PRICES FELL TWENTY FIVE PER CENT LAST MONTH 
COMING UP WHICH WELSH BADGERS 
COULD BE UNDER THREAT IN AN ATTEMPT 
TO STOP BOVINE T. B. 
LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON 
FORTY YEARS ON FROM DISASTER AT 
HEATHROW A HERO OF THE CRASH IS 
REMEMBERED REMEMBERED WILL IT BE AGONY OR ECSTASY FOR 
CHELSEA AND ARSENAL AS THEY BID FOR 
A PLACE IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
SEMIFINALS 
BEIJING HAS SAID THAT NO FORCE CAN 
STOP THE OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY ACROSS 
THE GLOBE DESPITE FACING MORE 
PROTESTS WHEN THE FLAME TRAVELS 
THROUGH SAN FRANCISCO TOMORROW 
INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE IS 
MEETING THIS WEEK IN CHINA TO 
CONSIDER WHETHER THE RELAY SHOULD 
BE CHANGED OR EVEN SCRAPPED ALL 
TOGETHER LEER'S OUR CHINA 
CORRESPONDENT JAMES REYNOLDS 
THE OLYMPIC TORCH CONTINUES ITS 
BATTERED RELAY ITS NEXT STOP IS 
SAN FRANCISCO WHERE PROTESTORS HAVE 
ALREADY MADE THEIR MARK THEY'VE 
HUNG A FREE TIBET BANNER FROM THE 
GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE THE TORCH RELAY 
WAS MEANT TO BE LAP OF HONOUR 
INSTEAD IT'S BECOME A HUGE 
EMBARRASSMENT 
HERE IN BEIJING INTERNATIONAL 
OLYMPIC OFFICIALS MAY NOW HAVE TO 
STEP IN AT THE END OF THE WEEK 
THEY WILL CONSIDER THE FUTURE OF 
THE TORCH RELAY 
ABSOLUTELY WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS 
THE TORCH RELAY THE OPPOSITE WOULD 
BE AN UNDERSTANDABLE WE WILL 
DISCUSS THIS AND WE WILL WHAT WE 
HAVE TO LOOK AT AFTER THIS 
A CANCELLATION WOULD BE A HUGE 
SETBACK FOR THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT 
THIS AFTERNOON THE FOREIGN 
MINISTRY INSISTED IT WOULDN'T BE 
PUT OFF BY PROTESTORS 
WE WARN THE ORGANISATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO 
WANT TO SABOTAGE THE OLYMPICS SO AS 
TO SERVE THEIR SECRET PURPOSE AND 
TO TARNISH CHINESE IMAGE AND PRESS 
CHINA THEY ARE DOOMED TO FAIL 
THE CHINESE MEDIA HAS TRIED TO DOWN 
PLAY THE PROTESTS BUT ORDINARY 
PEOPLE HERE HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE 
DISRUPTIONS DISRUPTIONS 
THE SEPARATIST BEHAVIOUR HAS REALLY DEPRESSED US 
BECAUSE IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT 
OCCASION FOR CHINA TO BE HOLDING 
THE OLYMPIC GAMES TIBET CANNOT BE 
SEPARATED FROM CHINA 
BEIJING STILL INSISTS THAT NOTHING 
CAN STOP THE TORCH RELAY BUT 
HERE'S THE PROBLEM FOR CHINA THE 
LONGER THE TORCH CONTINUES ON ITS 
JOURNEY THE MORE THIS COUNTRY GETS 
BURNED ANY FINAL DECISION WILL 
COME DOWN TO THE I. O. C. 
POLICE ARE TRYING TO FIND THE 
FORMER B. B. C. CHILDREN'S TELEVISION 
PRESENTER MARK SPEIGHT WHO HAS NOT 
BEEN SEEN SINCE YESTERDAY LAST 
WEEK AN INQUEST FOUND THAT HIS 
FIANCEE NATASHA COLLINS HAD DIED 
AFTER TAKING COCKTAIL OF DRUGS 
AND SLEEPING PILLS AFTER THE 
HEARING MR. SPATE SAID HE WAS 
DEVASTATED BY HER DEATH 
THIS IS THE LEAF 
MARK SPEIGHT 
WAS THE BRIGHT FRIENDLY FACE OF 
THE CHILDREN'S PROGRAMME SMART FOR 
FOURTEEN YEARS HE'S NOW GONE MISSING 
DESCRIBED BY POLICE AS VULNERABLE 
HE IS SAID TO BE HAVE BEEN 
DISTRAUGHT AT THE DEATH OF HIS 
GIRLFRIEND NATASHA COLLINS THE 
COUPLE HAD WORKED TOGETHER ON THE 
CHILDREN'S PROGRAMME SEE IT SAW IT 
BUT EARLIER THIS YEAR SHE WAS 
FOUND DEAD AT THE FLAT THEY SHARED 
SHE HAD TAKEN COCAINE A SLEEPING 
PILL WINE AND VODKA SHE WAS FOUND 
IN A BATH WITH SIXTY PER CENT OF HER BLOID 
SCALDED A CORONER LAST WEEK SAID 
IT WAS MISADVENTURE MARK SPEIGHT 
WAS NOT BLAMED BUT JUST OVER A 
MONTH AGO HE SAID HE COULD NO 
LONGER CARRY ON PRESENTING SMART 
SINCE THEN HE HAS BEEN STAYING WITH 
THE MOTHER OF NATASHA COLLINS 
HOWEVER YESTERDAY HE WAS DUE TO 
MEET A FRIEND AT LONDON'S COVENT 
GARDEN BUT HE FAILED TO TURN UP 
HE HAD SET OFF AT NINE THIRTY A M. FROM WOOD 
GREEN STATION BUT THEN DISAPPEARED 
THE ONLY SIGHTS WAS FOUR HOURS 
LATER HE WAS SEEN WALKING ALONG A 
ROAD IN NORTH LONDON POLICE 
FRIENDS AND FAMILY ARE ALL SAID TO 
BE WORRIED FOR HIS WELFARE 
WALES COULD BECOME THE FIRST PART 
OF THE U. K. TO CULL BADGERS TO STOP 
THE SPREAD OF TUBERCULOSIS IN 
CATTLE A DECISION IS EXPECTED TO 
BE MADE BY THE WELSH RURAL AFFAIRS 
MINISTER THIS AFTERNOON FARMERS 
ARGUE THAT BADGERS PASS ON THE 
DISEASE TO HERDS BUT 
CONSERVATIONISTS SAY THERE'S NO 
EVIDENCE THAT CULLING IS THE ANSWER 
WYRE DAVIS IS IN CAMARTHENSHIRE FOR 
US US THESE ANIMALS ARE HEALTHY BUT IN 
THE LAST YEAR THEY'VE LOST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
CATTLE HERE TO BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS 
THE FARMERS SAY THAT WILDLIFE MUST 
BE RESPONSIBLE WILDLIFE GROUPS 
DISAGREE AND SAY THE WIDESPREAD 
CULL BADGERS WOULD ACHIEVE NOTHING 
WILL YOU TAKE THIS OUT OF MY HANDS 
KNOWN TO MANY AS THE MID WALES 
BADGERMAN GARETH MORGAN HAS 
WATCHED AND GAINED THE TRUST OF 
THESE COMPLEX ANIMALS FOR MORE THAN 
ZERO YEARS 
THEY'RE DOING HERE WHAT 
THEY'VE BEEN DOING FOR THOUSANDS 
AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS ALL THEY'RE 
DOING IS GOING ABOUT WHAT THEY'VE 
ALWAYS DONE LET'S HOPE WE NEVER 
LOSE THEM 
FOR YEARS BADGERS HAVE 
RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY BEEN BLAMED FOR 
SPREADING TUBERCULOSIS AMONG CATTLE 
FARMERS HAVE LONG CALLED FOR A 
WIDESPREAD CULL OF BADGER IN WALES 
THE ASSEMBLY GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT TO 
ANNOUNCE ITS NEXT MOVE IT'S 
THOUGHT THERE ARE LESS THAN ONE 
MILLION BADGERS LIFING IN SETTS 
LIKE THIS IN THE U. K. ANY DECISION 
TO ERADICATE LARGE NUMBERS OF 
BADGERS WILL BE HUGELY UNPOPULAR 
WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC 
IT'S ALREADY BEEN TRIED IT'S BEEN 
SHOWN NOT TO WORK IT'S COMPLETELY 
POINTLESS AND UNNECESSARY SLAUGHTER 
BADGER GROUPS WANT MORE CAT TOLL BE 
TESTED TO ESTABLISH EXACTLY WHERE 
THE T. B. INFECTION COMES FROM 
FARMERS AND MANY VETS SAY BADGER 
NUMBERS MUST BE KEPT DOWN 
TO NOT 
CONTROL IT WOULD MEAN THAT LEVELS 
WOULD RISE IN THE CATTLE POPULATION 
WITH THE SUBSEQUENT RISK THEN TO 
HUMAN HEALTH 
COMPENSATING WELSH 
FARMERS FOR T. B. INFECTED CATTLE COST 
FIFTEEN MILLION LAST YEAR EVERYBODY 
AGREES IT'S A DISEASE THAT MUST BE 
KEPT IN CONTROL IS ERADICATING 
BADGERS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO ABOUT 
IT 
IT'S LUDICROUS TAKING CATTLE IT OUT OF INFECTED HERDS IF WE'RE NOT 
GETTING RID OF THE SOURCE OF THE 
INFECTION 
THAT SOURCE MOST INFECTION FARMERS ARGUE IS CLEARLY BADGERS 
HOWEVER ENDEARING WE MIGHT FIND 
THEM THEM ERADICATING ALL BADGERS WITHIN A 
DEFINED AREA WOULD BE PART OF A 
WIDER POLICY TO GET RID OF BUT 
IT WOULD BE HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL 
AND OF COURSE WHAT HAPPENS HERE IN 
WALES WILL BE CLOSELY WATCHED IN 
THE REST OF THE U. K. 
AMERICA'S TOP GENERAL IN IRAQ WILL 
GIVE HIS VERDICT TODAY ON THE 
PROGRESS OF MILITARY OPERATIONS IN 
THE COUNTRY BUT WHILE POLITICIANS 
DEBATE WHEN TO BRING BACK THE 
TROOPS NOWHERE IS THE DEBATE MORE 
CLOSELY FOLLOWED THAN AMONG THE 
FAMILIES OF THOSE SERVING IN IRAQ 
THE TOWN OF KILLEEN IN TEXAS IS 
HOME TO THE LARGEST ARMY BASE IN 
THE UNITED STATES JONATHAN BEALE 
WENT THERE TO MEET SOME OF THE 
FAMILIES FAMILIES FIVE YEARS ON BUT IN THIS TEXAS 
LEAVING BEHIND ALMOST TWO HUNDRED WIDOWS 
IT DOESN'T GET ANY EASIER AS THE 
DAYS GO BY 
DONNA KIERNAN LOST HER 
HUSBAND CHRIS ELEVEN MONTHS AGO 
KILLED BY SNIPER FIRE HER HOME HAS 
NOW BECOME HIS SHRINE WITH TOO 
MANY PAINFUL MEMORY SHE IS 
PREPARING TO LEAVE KILLEEN SHE 
ALSO QUESTIONS WHETHER THE 
SACRIFICE WAS WORTH IT 
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT 
FIVE OF OUR SOLDIERS DIED LAST WEEK 
BEFORE THAT IT WAS THREE BEFORE 
THAT WAS SIX SEEKERS I KNOW THIS 
I GO TO MY HUSBAND'S GRAVE WHEN HE 
WAS BURIED THE ROW ENDED BUT NOW 
THERE IS WHOLE SOLID ROW STRAIGHT 
IN FRONT OF HIS GRAVE THERE ARE SIXTEEN 
GRAVES THERE WITHOUT MARKERS THEY 
CAN'T MAKE HEADSTONES FAST ENOUGH 
OTHERS THOUGH TAKE COMFORT FROM 
LIVING AMONG A WIDER MILITARY 
FAMILY KIM GORDON HAD A DREAM OF 
OPENING THIS BAKERY WITH HER 
HUSBAND DAVID IN THE END SHE HAD 
TO DO IT ALONE DAVID WAS KILLED IN 
IRAQ IN A ROADSIDE BOMB 
THE BAKERY'S NOW A TRIBUTE TO HIM 
I WANT 
EVERYONE TO KNOW HIM WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW ABOUT HIM WHEN I 
PUT HIS PICTURE ON THE WALL AND I 
TELL MY STORY THAT'S MY WAY OF 
SAYING THAT MY HUSBAND WENT TO IRAQ 
AND HE PASSED AWAY AND HE MEANT 
SOMETHING HE'S NOT JUST ANOTHER 
NUMBER 
FIVE YEARS ON AND NO ONE KNOWS HOW 
OR WHEN THE IRAQ WAR WILL END 
IN THIS MILITARY CEMETERY THEY'RE 
STILL PREPARING FRESH GRAVES 
BUT THE FAMILIES OF THE FALLEN ARE 
HOPING THAT IT WON'T HAVE BEEN IN 
VAIN VAIN THE TIME IS TWELVE SIX P. M. HAVE YOU EVER 
BEEN SERVED BY A RUDE MEMBER OF 
STAFF AT A RESTAURANT HOW ABOUT 
GETTING RID OF THE HUMANS AND 
REPLACING THEM WITH MACHINES WOULD

RANT IN GERMANY HAS DONE STEVE 
ROSENBERG WENT ALONG TO SAMPLE THE 
SERVICE SERVICE GERMANY HAS GIVEN THE WORLD MANY 
INVENTIONS THE AIRSHIP THE DIESEL
