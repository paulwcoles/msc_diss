HELLO AND WELCOME TO GCSE BITESIZE 
THIS PROGRAMME WILL HELP YOU WITH YOUR GCSE HISTORY EXAMS 
THIS PROGRAMME CONCENTRATES ON MEDICINE THROUGH TIME AND THE AMERICAN WEST 
TWO OF THE MOST POPULAR COURSES OF THE GCSE SCHOOLS' HISTORY PROJECT 
THE OTHER HISTORY PROGRAMMES ARE 
THE BEST WAY TO STUDY WITH BITESIZE 
THIS IS A STUDY IN DEVELOPMENT 
THIS IS AN OPTIONAL STUDY IN DEPTH 
YOU HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT MEDICINE FROM THE STONE AGE TO THE PRESENT 
TO HANDLE SUCH A HUGE SPAN OF TIME 
IN THIS PROGRAMME WE'VE DIVIDED THE SUBJECTS INTO TWO SECTIONS 
WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE PERIOD BY PERIOD FROM PREHISTORIC TIMES UP TO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
WE ALSO LOOK AT LONG TERM THEMES 
SUCH AS WOMEN IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY 
SO LET'S GET STARTED 
THERE ARE REAL PROBLEMS IN FINDING OUT ABOUT THE PREHISTORIC PERIOD 
WITH NO WRITTEN EVIDENCE AVAILABLE 
THE EVIDENCE IS LIMITED TO CAVE PAINTINGS ARTEFACTS AND SKELETONS 
IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO STUDY RECENT PEOPLES WITH COMPARABLE LIFESTYLES 
SUCH AS NINETEENTH CENTURY AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES 
THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN CIVILISATION LASTED FROM ABOUT TO 
LOOK AT THE FOLLOWING CLIP ABOUT ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MEDICINE 
LOOK FOR DIFFERENCES AS WELL AS SOME SIMILARITIES WITH PREHISTORIC PEOPLE 
NOTE KEY POINTS ABOUT EGYPTIAN MEDICINE 
THANKS TO THEIR PASSION FOR BUILDING AND PAINTING ELABORATE TOMBS AND TEMPLES 
AND THE EARLY INVENTION OF WRITING WE HAVE MORE EVIDENCE ABOUT THEM THAN ANY OTHER ANCIENT CIVILISATION 
THEY BELIEVED IN AN AFTERLIFE 
THEY THOUGHT THAT A DEAD PERSON'S SPIRIT COULD BE REUNITED WITH THE BODY AS LONG AS THE BODY SURVIVED 
SO THEY DEVELOPED THE IDEA OF PRESERVING THE BODY BY EMBALMING IT 
USING SPICES TO KEEP IT FROM DECAY 
THIS DIDN'T WORK FOR THE MOST PERISHABLE PARTS LIKE THE LIVER 
SO THEY CUT THEM OUT AND PRESERVED THEM SEPARATELY IN SPECIAL JARS 
SOME PEOPLE THINK THIS EXPERIENCE HELPED THEM LEARN ABOUT THE BODY 
CERTAINLY SOME MEDICAL WRITINGS SUGGEST THAT FOUR THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
EGYPTIAN DOCTORS HAD WORKED OUT THAT THE HEART LIVER AND LUNGS WERE CONNECTED 
FORTY SIX CHANNELS GO FROM THE HEART TO EVERY LIMB 
IF A DOCTOR PRIEST OR MAGICIAN PUTS HIS FINGERS ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD OR HANDS HE HEARS THE HEART 
THERE ARE FOUR VESSELS TO THE LIVER AND FOUR VESSELS TO THE LUNGS 
FLOW AWAY COLD SON OF THE COLD 
WHO SHATTERS THE SKULL SO THAT SICKNESS OVERTAKES THE FOLLOWERS OF RA WHO APPEAL TO THOTH IN PRAYER 
BEHOLD I HAVE USED YOUR MEDICINE AGAINST YOU 
MILK OF A WOMAN WHO HAS GIVEN BIRTH TO A SON AND FRAGRANT GUM WILL GET RID OF YOU 
ABOVE ALL 
NEARLY EVERYONE CARRIED AMULETS OR CHARMS TO PROTECT AGAINST ILLNESS 
EGYPTIANS WERE REQUIRED TO WASH REGULARLY AND CHANGE THEIR CLOTHES 
ALTHOUGH RELIGIOUS RULES FORBADE DISSECTION 
NEW FACTORS IN EGYPTIAN CIVILISATION MADE MEDICAL ADVANCES POSSIBLE 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON PREHISTORIC AND EGYPTIAN MEDICINE 
THE CITY STATES OF ANCIENT GREECE FLOURISHED BETWEEN SIX HUNDRED AND 
THE GREEKS TRADED ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN AND LEARNT FROM OTHER CULTURES ESPECIALLY THE EGYPTIANS 
THEIR CULTURE WAS RICH ENOUGH THAT SOME PEOPLE HAD LEISURE FOR SCIENCE 
THEY WERE INTERESTED IN EXPLAINING THE WORLD AROUND THEM 
AND LOOKED FOR NATURAL EXPLANATIONS NOT JUST DIVINE ONES 
THIS IS A RECONSTRUCTION OF A BUILDING ON THE GREEK ISLAND OF COS 
IT WAS THE NEAREST THEY HAD TO A HOSPITAL 
BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY A TEMPLE TO THE GOD ASCLEPIUS THE GOD OF HEALING 
THIS IS A DESCRIPTION FROM A CARVED STONE TABLET FOUND IN A TEMPLE 
A MAN HAD AN ABSCESS IN HIS STOMACH 
HE CAME TO THE TEMPLE AND SLEPT 
HE DREAMED THAT THE GOD ASCLEPIUS ORDERED SERVANTS TO GRIP HIM 
ASCLEPIUS CUT HIS BELLY OPEN AND REMOVED THE ABSCESS THEN STITCHED HIM UP HE WAS CURED 
BUT THE FLOOR AROUND WAS COVERED IN BLOOD 
THESE PICTURES OF GODS SURVIVED BECAUSE SO MANY OF THEM WERE MADE 
BUT THEY DON'T TELL US THE FULL STORY ABOUT THE GREEKS 
PEOPLE HAD MANY DIFFERENT BELIEFS ABOUT ILLNESS 
HISTORIANS SAY MEDICINE WAS ALMOST LIKE A MARKET PLACE WITH DIFFERENT HEALERS OFFERING DIFFERENT CURES 
PHYSICIANS EXORCISTS BONE SETTERS SURGEONS HERBALISTS 
DOCTORS DISAGREED AMONG THEMSELVES 
THE CHOICE OF WHICH CURE TO TRY WAS LEFT TO THE INDIVIDUAL PATIENT 
PATIENTS TRIED ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING OFTEN RELIGIOUS HEALING WAS ONLY USED IN THE WORST CASES 
HERE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTICED 
PEOPLE WENT TO FIND CURES THROUGH WORSHIP WITH A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE 
THE GOD WITH A SNAKE AROUND HIS STAFF 
AND HIS DAUGHTERS PANACEA AND HYGEIA WOULD CURE THEM 
A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT MEDICAL BOOKS WERE WRITTEN BY THIS DOCTOR 
THESE DOCTORS DISCUSSED HOW ILLNESS WAS CAUSED AND HOW IT COULD BE CURED 
AND OBSERVED PATIENTS CAREFULLY TO FIND OUT WHAT CAUSED DISEASE 
THIS IS ONE CASE THEY WROTE ABOUT A CASE OF EPILEPSY 
THE BOY HAD THESE SYMPTOMS 
IN WINTER HE WAS SITTING BY THE FIRE IN THE BATH HOUSE BEING RUBBED WITH OIL SUDDENLY HE HAD A FIT 
WHEN THE FIT STOPPED HE LOOKED ABOUT HE WAS CONFUSED AND COULD HARDLY SPEAK 
WE TOOK HIM TO THE TEMPLE THEY CALLED IT THE SACRED DISEASE AND SAID WE WERE TO WAIT 
THEY SAID THEY WANTED TO SEE HIM WHEN THE FIT TOOK HOLD 
WHEN IT CAME IT WAS LIKE USUAL 
HE WAS FOAMING AT THE MOUTH 
AND KICKING WITH HIS LEGS 
DO YOU REMEMBER 
THEY SAID 
THAT ARIES WAS VISITING THE CHILD 
ARIES THE GOD DO YOU HEAR THAT SIMEUS 
HOW CAN THEY CALL THEMSELVES RELIGIOUS MEN WHEN THEY BELIEVE THE GODS WOULD DO THIS TO A CHILD 
IF HE'D SCREAMED OUT IN HIS FIT THEY WOULD HAVE SAID 
IT IS THE GOD POSEIDON BECAUSE HE IS NEIGHING LIKE POSEIDON'S HORSE 
AND IF HE'D PASSED SMALL TURDS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID 
IT'S APOLLO FOR APOLLO LOVES BIRDS AND THESE ARE LIKE BIRD DROPPINGS 
IT'S NONSENSE 
FOR THE HIPPOCRATIC DOCTORS EPILEPSY LIKE ANY OTHER DISEASE 
HAD NATURAL NOT SUPERNATURAL CAUSES 
ONE OF THEM WROTE BECAUSE THIS DISEASE IS SO DIFFERENT FROM OTHERS 
PEOPLE SAY IT'S CAUSED BY THE GODS 
PEOPLE VIEW THESE FITS IN IGNORANCE AND FEAR 
BUT THIS DISEASE IS A NATURAL DISEASE 
AND THOSE THAT CALL IT SACRED ARE WITCH DOCTORS FAITH HEALERS AND QUACKS 
FROM THEIR OBSERVATIONS HIPPOCRATIC DOCTORS CAME TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY 
THEY SAID THAT A HEALTHY BODY IS A BODY IN BALANCE 
AND A BODY OUT OF BALANCE IS SICK 
TOO MUCH HOT OR COLD TOO MUCH WET OR DRY COULD CAUSE SICKNESS 
THEY BELIEVED EPILEPSY WAS CAUSED BY TOO MUCH COLD WET PHLEGM BLOCKING THE AIR FROM MOVING AROUND THE BODY 
IT SHUTS OFF THE SUPPLY OF AIR TO THE BRAIN AND TO THE BLOOD 
LIKE THE NUMBNESS THAT YOU FEEL WHEN YOU'VE BEEN SEATED TOO LONG 
BUT IN THIS CASE IT CAUSES A FIT 
HE LOSES HIS VOICE AND HIS WITS 
WE ARE ALL UNSTABLE CREATURES 
WE ARE ALL LIABLE TO GET ILL 
AND A DISORDER THIS HARD TO DIAGNOSE 
IS HARDER YET TO CURE 
THIS IS STILL THE CORE OF MODERN METHODS OF MEDICAL TREATMENT 
IN MODERATION TAKING SOME EXERCISE SLEEPING REGULARLY KEEPING CLEAN 
A PERSON'S HEALTH WAS BELIEVED TO BE AFFECTED 
BY THE PROPORTION OF FOUR HUMOURS INSIDE THEM 
AN IMBALANCE WOULD CAUSE ILLNESS 
ONE OF THE WAYS OF RESTORING THE BALANCE WAS BLOOD LETTING 
IN EXAMS THIS QUESTION WOULD CARRY SIX MARKS HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER IT 
STOP THE TAPE NOW AND NOTE DOWN THE MAIN POINTS OF YOUR ANSWER 
LET'S LOOK AT SOME SUMMARY ANSWERS 
THE FIRST ATTEMPT COULD EXPECT AVERAGE MARKS AND THE SECOND HIGHER ONES 
THIS STUDENT'S EXPLAINED THE THEORY AND DESCRIBED HOW IT WAS PART OF MEDICAL PRACTICE FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
BUT ONLY DEALS WITH WHAT CAME AFTER 
NOT HOW HIPPOCRATIC DOCTORS BROKE WITH WHAT PEOPLE BELIEVED BEFORE 
THIS STUDENT HAS SET THE THEORY OF THE FOUR HUMOURS WITHIN HISTORY 
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS NOT SO MUCH THAT IT WAS COMMONLY BELIEVED FOR THE NEXT TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
BUT THAT IT BROKE AWAY FROM SPIRITUAL EXPLANATIONS TO NATURAL OR SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATIONS 
THE APPROACH WE HAVE TODAY 
NOW FOR THE ROMANS 
WHO LEARNT A LOT ABOUT MEDICINE FROM THE GREEKS BUT TOOK IT FURTHER 
THE GREEK PERIOD OF ROMAN HISTORY LASTED FROM ABOUT TO 
THE ROMANS BUILT UP A HUGE EMPIRE FROM NORTHERN ENGLAND TO THE MIDDLE EAST INCLUDING THE GREEK WORLD 
THEY FOUNDED TOWNS AND CITIES ALL OVER THEIR EMPIRE ROME WAS THE LARGEST CITY IN THE WORLD 
THEY BELIEVED IN MANY GODS BUT THE EMPIRE EVENTUALLY BECAME CHRISTIAN 
THE ROMANS WERE PRACTICAL AND THEIR APPROACH TO MEDICINE WAS BASED ON OBSERVATION AND COMMON SENSE 
THIS IS INCORRECT BUT THE THEORY LASTED UNTIL THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND LED TO PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS 
THE MOST INFLUENTIAL ROMAN DOCTOR WAS GALEN BORN IN 
AS YOU WATCH THE CLIP MAKE NOTES ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE MADE HIM SO IMPORTANT 
GALEN WAS BORN FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THE HIPPOCRATIC DOCTORS IN WHAT'S NOW TURKEY 
HE SPOKE GREEK BUT FOR FORTY YEARS HE PRACTISED IN ROME IN ITALY 
WHERE GREEK DOCTORS WERE CONSIDERED THE BEST 
HE TREATED THE EMPEROR SUCCESSFULLY AND BECAME ROME'S LEADING DOCTOR 
WE STILL HAVE HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHICH HE WROTE BECAUSE HE SAID 
SO MANY INFERIOR DOCTORS WERE PASSING OFF HIS WORK AS THEIR OWN 
GALEN WAS A SHOW OFF BUT ALSO A BRILLIANT DOCTOR 
THIS SIXTEENTH CENTURY ILLUSTRATION SHOWS HIM SOON AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN ROME 
PERFORMING A PUBLIC DISSECTION ON A LIVE PIG 
HIS AIM WAS TO SHOW THE DOCTORS OF ROME HOW FAR HIS STUDIES HAD ADVANCED 
DO YOU KNOW THEY STILL BELIEVE THE HEART CONTROLS WHAT WE DO 
IT'S THE BRAIN CONTROLS WHAT WE DO BUT ONLY IF YOU MAKE THE CUT CAN YOU PROVE IT 
SO I HAD THIS PIG STRAPPED TO THE TABLE I SLICED INTO ITS NECK 
AND FOUND ITS NERVES 
IT WAS SQUEALING THE WHOLE TIME EEEE EEEE I SAID WATCH 
WHEN I CUT THIS NERVE IT'LL SQUEAL SO I MAKE THE CUT 
EEE EEE 
AGAIN WHEN I CUT THIS NERVE AGAIN IT'LL SQUEAL 
EEE EEE 
BUT WHEN I CUT THIS NERVE THE PIG WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO SQUEAL 
AND I CUT 
AND THE PIG'S COMPLETELY SILENT 
PROVING THE BRAIN NOT THE HEART CONTROLS SPEECH 
EVERYTHING THEY BELIEVED PAH IN A MOMENT 
GALEN'S AIM WAS TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING ABOUT THE BODY THE PURPOSE OF EACH PART OF THE BODY 
WHAT THE HEART BRAIN AND LIVER DO AND HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER 
HE TURNED MEDICAL THINKING SINCE HIPPOCRATES INTO ONE SYSTEM 
A SYSTEM WHICH BECAME VERY POWERFUL AND THEN INFLUENCED WESTERN MEDICAL THOUGHT FOR THE NEXT ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED YEARS 
GALEN HAD A PROBLEM THAT HINDERED HIS DEVELOPMENT AS A DOCTOR 
HE NEEDED TO STUDY THE BODY INSIDE AS WELL AS OUT 
IN ANCIENT ROME CUTTING UP DEAD BODIES WAS SIMPLY NOT DONE 
IT WASN'T FORBIDDEN BUT FEW GREEKS OR ROMANS WOULD'VE DREAMED OF INTERFERING WITH A CORPSE 
IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS HOLDING BACK MEDICAL PROGRESS 
YOU HAVE TO STUDY HUMAN BONES 
I DON'T MEAN STUDY IN EVEN MY BOOKS WHICH GRANTED ARE BY FAR THE BEST I MEAN REAL BONES 
SKELETONS SEEING THEM WITH YOUR OWN EYES 
TOUCHING THEM UNDERSTANDING HOW THEY MOVE HOW THEY FIT TOGETHER 
IT'S DIFFICULT 
BUT IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE I WAS DOCTOR TO THE GLADIATOR SCHOOL FOR A WHILE THAT WAS GOOD 
THOSE FIT WELL MUSCLED MEN SLICING INTO EACH OTHER I GOT TO SEE INSIDE VERY INTERESTING WOUNDS 
GALEN ALSO USED TO SEARCH FOR BIG FAMILY TOMBS WITH THE MARBLE DOORS BROKEN SO HE COULD GET INSIDE 
I'D SPEND HOURS LOST IN EXCITEMENT FIXING MYSELF ON WHAT I WAS SEEING 
DETERMINED TO REMEMBER EVERY BONE EVERY JOINT 
HOW I'D HAVE WISHED TO TAKE A SKELETON TO HAVE IT WHEN I WROTE 
TO MAKE SURE MY ACCOUNT WAS PERFECT AND FREE FROM MISTAKES 
THOUGH GALEN CLAIMED TO HAVE SEEN HUMAN CORPSES 
THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS HE NEVER DID AN ACTUAL FULL DISSECTION ON A HUMAN BEING 
HE HAD TO RELY HEAVILY ON DISSECTING APES AND OTHER ANIMALS 
IT MEANT DESPITE HIS BRILLIANCE HE DID MAKE MISTAKES HE WROTE THAT THE LEFT KIDNEY IS LOWER THAN THE RIGHT 
CORRECT FOR AN APE BUT NOT FOR A HUMAN 
HE DESCRIBED THE WOMB BUT IN FACT HE WAS DESCRIBING THE WOMB OF A DOG 
AND BECAUSE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS MADE DISSECTIONS DIFFICULT IT WAS HARD FOR ANYONE TO CHALLENGE HIS WORK 
OR TO PROVE HE WAS WRONG 
IN HIS LIFETIME GALEN WROTE OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY BOOKS 
AND BECAUSE HE WAS WRITING AT THE CENTRE OF THE POWERFUL ROMAN EMPIRE 
HIS IDEAS SPREAD 
BUT TODAY ONLY ABOUT HALF THE WRITINGS HAVE SURVIVED AND THEY ARE COPIES OF COPIES OF COPIES 
GALEN WROTE GREEK BUT SOME OF HIS BOOKS SURVIVE ONLY IN TRANSLATIONS 
IN ARABIC HEBREW OR LATIN 
POINTS YOU SHOULD'VE NOTED GALEN REJECTED SUPERSTITION 
YOU MAY BE ASKED TO WRITE ON GALEN IN THE EXAM AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF QUESTION YOU COULD BE ASKED 
THIS STYLE OF QUESTION IS LIKE A COCONUT SHY INVITING YOU TO KNOCK IT DOWN 
IT GIVES SOME INFORMATION GALEN MADE MISTAKES 
IT TELLS YOU WHAT TO WRITE ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT GALEN WAS 
FINALLY IT ASKS YOU TO COMMENT ON IT THIS KIND OF QUESTION IS OFTEN USED IN AN EXAM 
NEVER AGREE WITH THE COCONUT SHY STATEMENT DON'T BE MISLED BY THE EXAMINER 
IS IT TRUE HE MADE MISTAKES ABOVE ALL 
EIGHT MARKS SO YOU SHOULD PROBABLY WRITE ABOUT THREE PARAGRAPHS 
EXAMINERS WANT AN ORGANISED ANSWER NOT JUST A JUMBLE OF POINTS 
OVER TO YOU STOP THE TAPE NOW AND 
HERE ARE THE MAIN POINTS YOU OUGHT TO MAKE AND A SUGGESTION FOR A PLAN 
IN MY HISTORY MOCK I GOT A D. I WAS REALLY REALLY GUTTED 
SO I DECIDED TO TRY AND CHANGE THAT 
I WENT TO LOADS OF REVISION CLASSES 
AND LEARNED TO REFER TO THE QUESTION IN THE END I GOT AN A 
RATHER THAN WRITE ALL YOU KNOW ABOUT THE TOPIC ANSWER THE QUESTION 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON GREEK AND ROMAN MEDICINE 
THE MEDIAEVAL PERIOD OR MIDDLE AGES 
LASTED FROM THE END OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF THE RENAISSANCE 
AFTER GALEN'S DEATH THE ROMAN EMPIRE BECAME LESS AND LESS POWERFUL 
IN ROME WAS SACKED 
THE ROMANS NO LONGER RULED WESTERN EUROPE 
AND THEIR CIVILISATION FELL APART 
THIS MEANT THAT MEDICAL STUDY WAS BADLY AFFECTED THERE WERE FEWER LIBRARIES AND SCHOOLS 
TRANSPORT WAS NOT SAFE SO SCHOLARS DIDN'T TRAVEL 
FEWER PEOPLE HAD THE MONEY AND TIME TO STUDY 
A VERY IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCE WAS THE SEPARATION OF THE LATIN AND GREEK LANGUAGES 
THE EASTERN AND WESTERN HALVES OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE GRADUALLY SPLIT APART 
GREEKS NO LONGER UNDERSTOOD LATIN AND ROMANS NO LONGER UNDERSTOOD GREEK 
SO MANY GREEK MEDICAL IDEAS WERE NOT STUDIED IN THE WEST 
THE GREEK LANGUAGE GALEN'S LANGUAGE SURVIVED IN THE EAST 
WHEN THE ARABS CONQUERED THE EASTERN PART OF THE OLD ROMAN EMPIRE ARABIC SCHOLARS DISCOVERED GREEK BOOKS 
AND TRANSLATED THEM INTO ARABIC 
FROM EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY TWO TO HUNDREDS OF GREEK WRITINGS ON MEDICINE AND SCIENCE WERE TRANSLATED INTO ARABIC 
WESTERN SCHOLARS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO READ THESE BOOKS FOR ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED YEARS 
A NUMBER OF FACTORS CAUSED THIS 
LIKE KNOWLEDGE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CLEAN WATER 
IT WAS ONLY IN MONASTERIES THAT GOOD WATER SYSTEMS SURVIVED 
LIBRARIES AND UNIVERSITIES COLLAPSED 
DURING THE NEXT CLIP 
MAKE SOME NOTES ABOUT THE MEDIAEVAL ATTITUDE TO MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE 
TEACHERS IN MEDIAEVAL UNIVERSITIES WOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD SCIENTIFIC WAYS OF LOOKING AT MEDICINE 
THEY BELIEVED THE BEST WAY TO LEARN MEDICINE WAS THROUGH READING ANCIENT BOOKS AND FOLLOWING THEM EXACTLY 
THIS IS A TYPICAL LECTURE FROM A MEDIAEVAL PROFESSOR BARTHOLOMEW OF BRUGES IN ABOUT ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY 
TELLING HIS STUDENTS 
WHY THEY SHOULD STUDY THE ANCIENT GREEK WRITER GALEN 
SOME STUDENTS ARE LAZY AND WANT TO BE EDUCATED WITHOUT DOING THE WORK 
OTHERS ARE THICK HEADED THEY RUSH THROUGH BOOKS AND THEN FORGET THEM 
OTHERS HAVE NO ENTHUSIASM 
GALEN HAS WRITTEN THE BEST BOOK FOR THESE STUDENTS IT IS CALLED THE ART OF MEDICINE 
NO OTHER BOOK HAS SO MUCH IN IT NO OTHER BOOK IS SO EASY TO REMEMBER 
MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS BOOK IS WRITTEN BY GALEN 
AND AFTER HIPPOCRATES GALEN IS THE BEST WRITER 
THIS BOOK IS ACCURATE AND CONTAINS EVERYTHING YOU WANT IN MEDICINE 
IT OUGHT TO BE READ FIRST BEFORE ALL OTHER BOOKS 
NO ONE EVER SUGGESTED THEY SHOULD TEST GALEN'S IDEAS OR TRY ANYTHING DIFFERENT TO WHAT GALEN HAD SAID 
GALEN'S WORK WAS CONSIDERED BETTER THAN THE WORK OF ANYONE ALIVE THIS WAS MEDIAEVAL UNIVERSITY TEACHING 
TO LOOK BACK ALMOST WITHOUT QUESTION TO THE WORK OF PEOPLE WHO LIVED ONE THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE 
AND ASTROLOGY 
ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WERE ALSO MORE NATURAL RATIONAL IDEAS 
FOR ALL KINDS OF CONDITIONS 
ADOPTED FROM A OF HIPPOCRATES 
HOSPITALS WERE IN MONASTERIES AND OFFERED FOOD A BED AND PRAYERS 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON MEDIAEVAL MEDICINE 
THE RENAISSANCE BEGAN IN EUROPE AROUND FOURTEEN HUNDRED 
ITS EFFECTS LASTED WELL INTO THE MID EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
AS YOU WATCH JOT DOWN NOTES ABOUT RENAISSANCE ATTITUDES TO THE WISDOM OF THE PAST 
THE RENAISSANCE WAS THE REBIRTH OF LEARNING 
AN EXCITING TIME FOR INTELLECTUALS AND ARTISTS 
DURING THE RENAISSANCE SCHOLARS BECAME EVEN MORE INTERESTED IN THE ANCIENT WORLD 
AND AS THEY FOUND OUT MORE SOME SCHOLARS ALSO BEGAN TO ASK QUESTIONS AND TO THINK SCIENTIFICALLY 
AT FIRST SCHOLARS ONLY KNEW THE ANCIENT MEDICAL BOOKS AS LATIN TRANSLATIONS 
BY FIFTEEN HUNDRED AS MORE PEOPLE LEARNED GREEK THEY COULD READ GREEK WRITERS IN THEIR ORIGINAL LANGUAGE 
IT BECAME FASHIONABLE TO COPY ANCIENT GREEK WAYS 
SCHOLARS SAW HOW SOME ANCIENTS WERE INTERESTED IN OBSERVATION 
AND IN DISCUSSING THEIR IDEAS 
THEY BEGAN TO EXPERIMENT AND TO USE THESE IDEAS TO DEVELOP MEDICINE 
THEY SAW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEDIAEVAL ART AND GREEK ART 
GREEK AND ROMAN STATUES SEEMED TO BE MORE REALISTIC 
THE BODY WAS SHOWN WITH MUSCLES AND SINEWS 
IN RETURNING TO THESE TRADITIONS LOOKING FOR YOURSELF TRUSTING YOUR EYES SEARCHING OUT WHAT'S REAL 
SOME SCHOLARS FOUND THEMSELVES IN A DILEMMA 
BY LOOKING TOO HARD THEY FOUND THEMSELVES SOME THINGS THE ANCIENTS HAD BELIEVED TRUE 
HERE ARE A FEW OF THE POINTS YOU SHOULD'VE NOTICED 
IN THE REFORMATION THE CHURCH LOST ITS HOLD OVER MANY COUNTRIES AS WELL AS UNIVERSITIES AND EDUCATION 
GIVING A DIFFERENT PICTURE OF HIM AND HIS STRESS ON OBSERVATION 
WHILE YOU WATCH THE NEXT CLIP MAKE NOTES ON THE CONTRIBUTION THESE TWO MEN MADE TO MEDICAL HISTORY 
VESALIUS WAS BORN IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FOURTEEN IN BELGIUM 
HIS FATHER WAS AN APOTHECARY HIS GRANDFATHER WAS A DOCTOR 
EVEN AS A BOY VESALIUS USED TO TRAP SMALL ANIMALS TO DISSECT THEM 
BY THE AGE OF TWENTY THREE 
HE WAS PROFESSOR OF ANATOMY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PADUA IN ITALY 
AT FIRST LIKE EVERY OTHER STUDENT HE USED GALEN'S WORK AND FOLLOWED IT CLOSELY 
AGED NINETEEN HE EVEN STOLE THE SKELETON OF A HANGED CONVICT TO KEEP IN HIS ROOM 
BUT THE MORE HE SAW THE MORE HE CAME TO REALISE THAT GALEN HAD ACTUALLY MADE MISTAKES 
STOP IT YOU'RE ANNOYING ME 
I KNOW AND IT'S ESPECIALLY ANNOYING BECAUSE I'M RIGHT 
YOU ARE NOT RIGHT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO CONVINCE YOU 
IF GALEN SAID WE HAD THREE ARMS WOULD YOU BELIEVE HIM HE SAYS THE HUMAN JAWBONE HAS TWO BONES 
THE MONKEY'S JAWBONE I GRANT YOU HAS TWO BONES BUT THE HUMAN JAWBONE HAS ONE 
LOOK AT IT 
UNLIKE GALEN VESALIUS WAS ABLE TO CARRY OUT MANY MANY DISSECTIONS 
HE COULD DO WHAT GALEN HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO 
PROVIDE AN ACCURATE MAP OF THE INSIDE OF THE ENTIRE HUMAN BODY 
IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY THREE STILL JUST TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD 
VESALIUS PUBLISHED HIS MASTERPIECE THE FABRICA 
A COMPLETE MAP OF THE HUMAN BODY 
BONE AND MUSCLE VEINS AND ARTERIES NERVES AND ORGANS ILLUSTRATED BY ARTISTS IN THE NEW REALISTIC STYLE 
THE BOOK WAS PRINTED AND READ WIDELY 
WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO EVERY MEDICAL STUDENT IN WESTERN EUROPE WOULD SEE FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THE BODY AS IT ACTUALLY WAS IT DIDN'T EXPLAIN ILL HEALTH'S CAUSES 
BUT IT HELPED THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS TO MAKE NEW DISCOVERIES ABOUT THE BODY 
HARVEY ALSO STUDIED MEDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PADUA 
ABOUT FIFTY YEARS AFTER VESALIUS 
ALTHOUGH VESALIUS HAD SHOWN THAT GALEN COULD BE WRONG 
MOST DOCTORS WERE STILL RELYING ON GALEN'S IDEAS 
HIS WORK WAS REPRINTED MANY TIMES IN THIS PERIOD AND WIDELY READ IN THE UNIVERSITIES 
HARVEY USED SCIENTIFIC METHODS TO PROVE THINGS 
INSTEAD OF JUST ACCEPTING GALEN'S WORK HE CARRIED OUT MANY OF HIS OWN EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMALS 
THIS WAS HOW HARVEY DISCOVERED THAT GALEN WAS WRONG ABOUT HOW THE BLOOD MOVES AROUND THE BODY 
HARVEY MADE A TOTALLY NEW DISCOVERY OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD 
BY CAREFUL MEASURING HARVEY WORKED OUT THAT THE AMOUNT OF BLOOD PUMPED BY THE HEART WAS SO MUCH 
THAT IT COULDN'T BE USED UP IN THE WAY GALEN DESCRIBED 
GALEN SAID THAT THE LIVER PRODUCES BLOOD WHICH IS USED UP FOR THE BODY'S FOOD 
WHAT MY WORK SHOWS IS THAT THE BLOOD IS SENT ROUND THE BODY BY THE HEART 
FURTHERMORE IT IS NOT USED UP 
THE SAME BLOOD CIRCULATES AROUND THE BODY AGAIN AND AGAIN 
IN HARVEY'S MOST FAMOUS EXPERIMENT HE PROVED THAT BLOOD ONLY TRAVELLED ROUND THE BODY IN ONE DIRECTION 
HE SHOWED THAT IF YOU PUT YOUR FINGER ABOVE A VALVE IN THE VEIN OF THE ARM 
THEN FLATTEN THE VEIN UP TO THE NEXT VALVE THE VEIN CANNOT FILL UP AGAIN 
TILL YOU TAKE YOUR FINGER AWAY 
BLOOD CAN ONLY FLOW IN ONE DIRECTION THROUGH THE VEINS 
HE FINALLY PUBLISHED HIS WORK IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT 
NOW ALL HIS EXPERIMENTS COULD BE COPIED ANY OTHER SCIENTIST COULD CHECK WHETHER HE WAS RIGHT 
IN HIS BOOK HE POINTED OUT THAT HIS WORK WAS BASED NOT ON TEXTBOOKS BUT ON DISSECTIONS 
HIS THINKING CAN STILL BE DEMONSTRATED TODAY THIS IS ANOTHER DESCRIPTION FROM HIS WORK 
I TOOK THE SHELL FROM AN EGG AND PLACED THE EGG IN WARM WATER 
HERE I COULD SEE A SMALL SPOT WHICH BEAT 
I CONCLUDED THAT THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF LIFE 
HARVEY'S WORK MADE TODAY'S MEDICINE POSSIBLE 
UNDERSTANDING BLOOD CIRCULATION MEANT THAT DOCTORS IN THE FUTURE 
COULD DEVELOP BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS AND MAJOR SURGICAL OPERATIONS 
THE MAIN POINTS YOU SHOULD'VE NOTED 
AND DEALING WITH THE ENTIRE BODY AS A PRINTED BOOK IT 
AVAILABLE IN EVERY MEDICAL SCHOOL IN EUROPE 
LATER IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY OBSERVATIONS WITH THE NEWLY INVENTED MICROSCOPE CONFIRMED HARVEY'S THEORY 
BY ENABLING THE SMALLEST BLOOD VESSELS TO BE SEEN 
EVEN VESALIUS AND HARVEY HAD LITTLE TO SAY ABOUT THE CAUSES OF ILLNESS OR TREATMENTS 
BUT SOME DID HAVE LOTS OF EXPERIENCE AND HANDED DOWN WISDOM 
QUACKS CHEAP UNQUALIFIED OPERATORS 
WISE WOMEN KNOWLEDGE OF HERBS AND SIMPLE TREATMENTS 
NOW FOR SOME EXAM PRACTICE 
THIS PRINT'S EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE VERY END OF THE RENAISSANCE PERIOD 
A PATIENT'S BEING TREATED BY BLEEDING 
THIS TYPE OF QUESTION CARRIES TEN MARKS 
IN THE EXAM YOU'D NEED TO WRITE A SHORT ESSAY TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION 
HERE ARE TWO BRIEF SUMMARY ANSWERS 
ONE IN GRADE C. TERRITORY ONE MORE LIKELY TO GET AN A 
THIS ANSWER GIVES THE FACTS O. K. 
BUT THERE'S NO EXPLANATION AS TO NO NEW IDEAS WERE THOUGHT OF 
THIS ANSWER NOT ONLY EXPLAINS THE THEORY OF HUMOURS IT ALSO PLACES IT IN ITS HISTORICAL CONTEXT 
IT GIVES EXPLANATIONS OF WHY BLOODLETTING WAS ACCEPTED FIRST BY ROMANS THEN BY MEDIAEVAL DOCTORS 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON RENAISSANCE MEDICINE 
UP TO TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO CHANGE IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE HAD MOSTLY BEEN EXTREMELY SLOW 
BUT IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THINGS BEGAN TO CHANGE VERY FAST 
IN FACT SOME STILL BELIEVED IN THE FOUR HUMOURS 
BY THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTIES THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION HAD BROUGHT ENORMOUS WEALTH TO MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES 
ACROSS EUROPE INCLUDING A REVOLUTIONARY NEW IDEA 
A KEY FIGURE IN THIS DISCOVERY 
WHILE YOU WATCH THE NEXT CLIP 
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT 
A LOCAL BREWER WAS HAVING PROBLEMS 
FERMENTATION THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE GOING ON IN THE VATS WASN'T WORKING 
SO THE ALCOHOL WASN'T FORMING PROPERLY 
HE HAD ASKED FOR PASTEUR'S HELP 
PLEASE AFTER A CAREFUL SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS PASTEUR FOUND THE EXPLANATION 
HARMFUL MICRO ORGANISMS IN THE VATS ARE CAUSING ALL THE TROUBLE LEAVE IT TO ME A SOLUTION CAN BE FOUND 
THANK YOU MONSIEUR 
BUT THERE WERE WIDER IMPLICATIONS 
EVERYTHING INDICATES THAT CONTAGIOUS DISEASES OWE THEIR EXISTENCE TO SIMILAR CAUSES 
AND PASTEUR'S WORK WOULD NOT ONLY SHED LIGHT ON DISEASE 
BUT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEBATE 
ABOUT WHAT WAS KNOWN AS THE THEORY OF SPONTANEOUS GENERATION 
SUPPOSE I BOIL LIQUID 
AND LEAVE IT TO COOL AFTER A FEW DAYS 
MOULDINESS LITTLE ANIMALS WILL DEVELOP IN THE LIQUID 
BY BOILING I DESTROYED ANY GERMS BUT THE LIQUID BEING AGAIN IN CONTACT WITH THE AIR WILL CHANGE 
BECOME MOULDY 
NOW SUPPOSE THAT BEFORE BOILING THE LIQUID I DRAW THE NECK OF THE FLASK INTO A POINT 
LEAVING ITS END OPEN THEN I BOIL THE LIQUID IN THE FLASK AND LEAVE IT TO COOL 
THE LIQUID WILL REMAIN PURE 
NOT ONLY FOR TWO DAYS A MONTH A YEAR 
BUT TWO OR THREE YEARS 
WHAT DIFFERENCE IS THERE THEN BETWEEN THESE TWO FLASKS 
IN THE FIRST THE DUSTS SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AND THEIR GERMS 
CAN FALL INTO THE FLASK AND ARRIVE IN CONTACT WITH THE FLUID 
IN THE SECOND 
THE DUST FALLS ON ITS CURVED NECK OR INTO THE FIRST CURVE ONLY 
THE ONE THING THAT CANNOT ENTER EASILY IS THE DUST SUSPENDED IN THE AIR 
THE PROOF OF THIS IS THAT IF I SHAKE THE FLASK VIOLENTLY TWO OR THREE TIMES 
IN A FEW DAYS IT WILL CONTAIN LITTLE ANIMALS OR MOULDINESS 
WHY BECAUSE AIR HAS COME IN VIOLENTLY ENOUGH TO CARRY THE DUST WITH IT 
NEVER WILL THE DOCTRINE OF SPONTANEOUS GENERATION RECOVER FROM THE MORTAL BLOW 
OF THIS SIMPLE EXPERIMENT 
SET HIMSELF A PROBLEM 
PASTEUR DIDN'T APPLY HIS THEORY OF MICROBES TO HUMAN DISEASE 
BUT THIS GERMAN PHYSICIAN DID 
KOCH HAD SET UP A LABORATORY IN HIS HOME 
AT HIS AND HIS FAMILY'S OWN EXPENSE 
IN THIS REMOTE COUNTRY AREA THERE WAS AN OUTBREAK OF ANTHRAX 
A DISEASE WHICH DECIMATED SHEEP AND CATTLE AND OCCASIONALLY INFECTED HUMANS 
KOCH WHO HAD DEVELOPED A SPECIAL INTEREST IN MICROSCOPES DECIDED TO INVESTIGATE 
HIS RESEARCH BUILT ON THE WORK OF PASTEUR AND LISTER ON MICRO ORGANISMS 
A FEATURE OF ANTHRAX WAS THAT CATTLE COULD CATCH IT NOT ONLY FROM OTHER INFECTED CATTLE BUT FROM THE SOIL 
WHERE INFECTED ANIMALS HAD GRAZED 
KOCH SHOWED THIS WAS BECAUSE THE TYPE OF MICRO ORGANISMS OR BACTERIA RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISEASE 
COULD EXIST IN THE SOIL AS PARTICULARLY HARDY FORMS SPORES 
WHEN THESE SPORES ARE ONCE FORMED 
IN THE SOIL THERE IS GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT ANTHRAX CAN REMAIN IN THIS REGION FOR MANY YEARS 
WE MUST SEEK MEASURES TO SAVE ANIMALS AND PROTECT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM AN AGONISING DEATH 
BUILDING IN TURN ON KOCH'S WORK 
HE USED THE TECHNIQUE OF VACCINATION 
COWPOX IS CLOSELY RELATED TO SMALLPOX BUT IT'S HARMLESS 
BUT JENNER DIDN'T KNOW HOW THIS WORKED 
BECAUSE OF HIS WORK ON MICROBES 
OTHER RESEARCHERS BUILT ON THESE DISCOVERIES 
HE FOUND THAT ANIMALS MAKE ANTI TOXINS IN THEIR BLOOD 
TO FIGHT HARMFUL BACTERIA 
HE USED ANIMAL BLOOD CONTAINING SUCH TOXINS TO CURE DIPHTHERIA IN HUMANS 
FOUND A WAY OF USING CHEMICAL DYES 
TO ATTACK SPECIFIC BACTERIA 
BUT NOT HARM THE REST OF THE BODY 
A MAGIC BULLET THAT WOULD ONLY KILL ITS TARGET 
THESE SCIENTISTS WEREN'T JUST 
THIS IS ONE KIND OF QUESTION YOU'LL BE FACED WITH IN THE EXAMS 
STOP THE TAPE NOW AND HAVE A GO 
YOU CAN REWIND AND WATCH THIS SECTION AGAIN 
TO ANSWER A QUESTION ON THESE DISCOVERIES 
HOPEFULLY YOU'LL HAVE SPOTTED SOME OR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING POINTS 
OBVIOUSLY INDIVIDUALS WERE IMPORTANT 
PASTEUR KOCH BEHRING AND EHRLICH BUILT ON EACH OTHERS' WORK 
CONDUCTING EXPERIMENTS RECORDING THEN PUBLISHING WORK MEANT THAT OTHERS COULD CHECK RESULTS 
AND THEN TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER 
IMPORTANT IN SPREADING 
NEW SCIENTIFIC IDEAS 
MICROSCOPES LET SCIENTISTS INVESTIGATE MICRO ORGANISMS 
A BREWERY COMMISSIONED PASTEUR 
AND MUCH TIME CONSUMING RESEARCH WAS FUNDED BY GOVERNMENTS 
ALL THESE FACTORS CONTINUED INTO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON THE NINETEENTH CENTURY MEDICAL REVOLUTION 
A TIME OF REVOLUTIONARY NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE USE OF DRUGS TO FIGHT DISEASE 
DRUGS WHICH COULD DESTROY CERTAIN GERMS WITHOUT HARMING THE BODY 
GERMAN SCIENTIST PAUL EHRLICH DISCOVERED 
SULPHONOMIDE WAS CHEMICAL ANTIBIOTIC 
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL THE NEW DRUGS 
BY ALEXANDER FLEMING 
HE'D HAD AN INTEREST IN FIGHTING INFECTIONS IN WAR WOUNDS SINCE WWI 
DISEASE WHOSE GUERRILLA WARFARE AGAINST THE RED CROSS FLAG 
HAS OUT GENERALLED THE GREATEST COMMANDERS SUFFERS A SETBACK THANKS TO THE NEW MIRACLE DRUG 
PENICILLIN 
BEFORE ANTIBIOTICS WERE AVAILABLE MANY INFECTIONS WERE LETHAL 
THEY WERE FEARED AS CANCER AND HEART DISEASE ARE TODAY 
ONE DAY IN THE YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT 
HE WAS EXAMINING SOME SEPSIS GERMS GROWN ON JELLY BEFORE SENDING THEM TO BE DESTROYED 
HE NOTICED THAT ONE OF THE DISHES HAD GONE MOULDY AND THAT ROUND THE PATCH OF GREEN MOULD 
THE SEPSIS GERMS WERE DYING SOME POWERFUL NATURAL ANTISEPTIC WAS OBVIOUSLY EXUDED FROM THE MOULD 
IT WAS A DAILY EVENT FOR FLEMING TO LEAVE HIS LABORATORY DOWN THE STAIRS 
AND COME UPSTAIRS ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK 
TO GET A CUP OF COFFEE 
ON THIS OCCASION HE HAD A CULTURE PLATE IN HIS HAND AND PROCEEDED TO SHOW IT TO ALL OF US 
AND I THINK IT'D BE CORRECT TO SAY 
THAT NOBODY TOOK THE SLIGHTEST NOTICE OF FLEMING'S DISCOVERY 
FOR A VERY LONG WHILE 
AFTER FLEMING'S DISCOVERY HOWEVER RESEARCH ON PENICILLIN STOPPED 
UNTIL JUST BEFORE THE OUTBREAK OF WORLD WAR TWO 
FROM A CANADIAN FACTORY THE STORY OF PRODUCTION OF ONE OF THE GREAT MODERN DISCOVERIES IN MEDICINE 
PENICILLIN IS MASS PRODUCED AND IS GOING OUT TO THE FIGHTING FRONT 
TO REDUCE THE DANGER OF INFECTION BY GERMS IN WOUNDS 
THE MIRACLE DRUG PENICILLIN 
WASN'T PUT INTO PRODUCTION UNTIL THE BRITISH AND AMERICAN ARMIES SAW A PRESSING NEED FOR IT 
TOWARDS THE END OF THE WAR MEDICAL TEAMS WERE ISSUED WITH NEW SUPPLIES OF THE DRUG FOR THE D. DAY LANDINGS 
PENICILLIN SAVED WOUNDED MEN WHO PREVIOUSLY WOULD'VE DIED FROM BATTLEFIELD INFECTIONS 
GANGRENE FROM WHICH MILLIONS HAVE PERISHED IN WARS CONQUERED BY THE MIRACLE OF PENICILLIN 
SCIENTISTS ARE MANUFACTURING THIS WONDER DRUG IN ENORMOUS QUANTITIES FOR ALLIED ARMIES ON EVERY FRONT 
SCIENTISTS DID NOT THINK OF IT UNTIL THEY KNEW ABOUT GERMS AND INFECTION FROM PASTEUR KOCH AND EHRLICH 
BECAUSE RESEARCH GOT MORE AND MORE EXPENSIVE 
AND ITS MASS PRODUCTION 
THE SUCCESS OF PENICILLIN WAS THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF DRUG DISCOVERIES 
THAT ENABLED DOCTORS TO PREVENT OR CURE SOME FEARED DISEASES 
ALL OVER EUROPE REGARDLESS OF IDEOLOGY MORE WAS SPENT ON ROUTINE MEDICINE AND CLINICS 
BUT PRIORITY WAS GIVEN TO THE FIGHT AGAINST THE HANDFUL OF DISEASES THAT TOOK A RELENTLESS TOLL 
TUBERCULOSIS WAS THE BIGGEST KILLER BY FAR 
T. B. CONSUMPTION FLOURISHED ESPECIALLY WHERE THERE WAS POVERTY 
PATIENTS WERE OF ALL AGES DOCTORS SOMETIMES INTERVENED WITH SURGERY 
ONE PROCEDURE INVOLVED REMOVING SEVERAL RIBS TO EASE THE PRESSURE ON THE DAMAGED LUNGS 
WITH T. B. STILL TAKING SO MANY LIVES 
SCIENTISTS RACED TO FIND A CURE 
AND IN NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR CAME THE NEWS SO MANY HAD WAITED FOR 
OUR NEW SERIES OF WONDER DRUGS JOINS THE FIGHT ON TUBERCULOSIS 
TWO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES SIMULTANEOUSLY DEVELOPED A NEW SYNTHETIC ANTI T. B. AGENT 
THE BREAKTHROUGH WAS BASED ON THE WORK PIONEERED WITH PENICILLIN 
WITHIN FIVE YEARS 
THE NUMBER OF T. B. DEATHS IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD HALVED 
THROUGHOUT THE WEST THE DISEASE WOULD ALMOST DISAPPEAR 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MORE PEOPLE SURVIVED AND AS T. B. WAS CONQUERED 
POLIOMYELITIS REPLACED IT IN THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION AS THE MOST FEARED INFECTIOUS DISEASE 
MY NAME IS VIRUS POLIOMYELITIS 
I CONSIDER MYSELF QUITE AN ARTIST 
I SPECIALISE IN GROTESQUES 
TWISTING AND DEFORMING HUMAN BODIES 
THAT'S WHY I'M CALLED 
THE CRIPPLER 
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ME BUT I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN MY SHADOW 
POLIO DESTROYED THE NERVES ITS VICTIMS LOST CONTROL OF THEIR MUSCLES 
PEOPLE THOUGHT THE VIRUS WAS PASSED ON THROUGH WATER 
IN SUMMER PUBLIC SWIMMING POOLS WERE CLOSED 
CHARITIES TRIED TO RAISE FUNDS FOR CONTINUING RESEARCH LEADING FIGURES HELPED WITH PUBLICITY 
VICE PRESIDENT NIXON CLEANED WINDSCREENS FOR A DAY 
YOUR FAITH IN MEDICAL SCIENCE AND THE UNENDING FIGHT AGAINST DISEASE 
HAS HELPED BRING ABOUT THE NEWEST MIRACLE THE SALK ANTI POLIO VACCINE WHICH THEORETICALLY 
COULD LEAD TO ONE HUNDRED PER CENT PROTECTION 
AND SOON THE POLIO EFFORT PAID OFF TOO 
AFTER THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL TESTS IT WAS PLANNED TO INOCULATE EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA 
LET'S LOOK AT A TYPICAL EXAM QUESTION 
IT MENTIONS ONE FACTOR THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG IN THIS CASE WAR 
THIS FOCUSES MOSTLY ON THE ROLE OF WAR 
THOUGH IT DOES EXPLAIN THAT OTHER FACTORS MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED 
THIS ANSWER INCLUDES THE ROLE OF WAR BUT THEN LOOKS AT OTHER FACTORS 
THE PARTS OF THE ICEBERG WHICH ARE HIDDEN BELOW THE WATER 
AND IT COMES TO A CONCLUSION ABOUT THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF WAR 
NOTICE THAT IT USES EXACTLY THE SAME FACTS AS THE GRADE C. ANSWER 
BUT IT USES THEM MORE EFFECTIVELY TO SHOW A GRASP OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HISTORICAL FACTORS 
REVISING IT'S SOMETIMES GOOD TO LISTEN TO MUSIC TO HELP YOU RELAX 
BUT NOT SOMETHING YOU LIKE IT'S DISTRACTING YOU'D BE SINGING ALONG 
THE END OF THE SECTION ON THE DRUG REVOLUTION AND ALSO THE WHOLE OF SECTION ONE PERIODS 
THREE IMPORTANT THEMES THAT RUN THROUGH THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE 
H. M. M. YOUR TEMPERATURE'S UP A BIT LOVE YOU'LL HAVE TO STAY IN BED 
I'LL GIVE YOU A NICE COOL DRINK AND SOME PARACETAMOL AND IF YOU AREN'T BETTER SOON I'LL CALL THE DOCTOR 
WON'T STOP CRYING EH YOU BUY HIM A PENNYWORTH OF DILL AND HE'LL SLEEP LIKE AN ANGEL 
I'LL MAKE A SIMPLE OF POWDERED AGRIMONY 
DO YOU GIVE IT HIM IN BOILED WATER THREE PINCHES NIGHT AND MORN 
AND THE STOMACHACHE WILL GO IN THREE DAYS 
AND MOST UNIVERSITIES WERE CLOSED TO WOMEN 
THE NEXT CLIP'S ABOUT A FRENCHWOMAN 
JACOBA DE FELICE YOU ARE BROUGHT BEFORE THIS COURT 
BY THE FACULTY OF MEDICINE IN PARIS TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING CHARGES 
THAT YOU VISITED MANY SEVERELY ILL PEOPLE IN PARIS AND EXAMINED THEM AND AFTER EXAMINATION SAID 
I WILL CURE YOU BY GOD'S WILL IF YOU WILL TRUST IN ME FURTHER 
YOU RECEIVED MONEY FROM THEM AND CONTINUED TO TREAT THEM 
THOUGH YOU HAVE NO QUALIFICATIONS FROM THE MEDICAL SCHOOL OF PARIS MONSIEUR DESPITE PREVIOUS FINES 
AND EXCOMMUNICATION FOR THIS OFFENCE YOU HAVE CONTINUED 
IT WAS THE TIME WHEN IT WAS VERY HOT I HAD THIS TERRIBLE SICKNESS IN MY HEAD AND EARS 
JACOBA VISITED ME SHE TOOK A LOT OF CARE AND CONCERN OVER ME 
AND DID SHE TREAT YOU IN ANY WAY SHE CERTAINLY DID SHE GAVE ME DIFFERENT COLOURED POTIONS 
I'D HAD THIS FEVER TERRIBLE IT WAS AND I'D HAD ANY NUMBER OF DOCTORS COMING TO TRY AND CURE ME 
AND THEN YOU WERE VISITED BY JACOBA 
YES THANK THE LORD THE OTHER DOCTORS HAD GIVEN ME UP FOR DEAD 
I HAD BEEN SEIZED BY AN ILLNESS SO SEVERE THAT MY OWN LIMBS COULD NOT SUPPORT ME I WAS CRIPPLED 
I TRIED WATER TREATMENT AT THE PUBLIC BATHS AND JACOBA VISITED ME BOTH THERE AND IN MY HOME 
WAS TREATMENT PRESCRIBED INDEED SHE GAVE ME A PURGATIVE 
AND PREPARED MEDICINAL BATHS AND OINTMENTS JUST LIKE THE OTHER DOCTORS EXCEPT THIS TIME IT WORKED 
JACOBA CLAIMS TO BE AN EXPERT IN THE ART OF MEDICINE 
THIS CANNOT BE SINCE SHE IS NOT APPROVED BY THE FACULTY AND HAS NOT STUDIED AT THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE 
AS TO THE PEOPLE SHE CLAIMS TO HAVE CURED IT IS PLAIN THAT ANY MAN COULD'VE CURED THEM BETTER THAN SHE 
MONSIEUR IS IT NOT TRUE THAT UNLICENSED PERSONS ARE FORBIDDEN FROM PRACTISING THE LAW INDEED 
HOW MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAT THEY SHOULD BE FORBIDDEN FROM PRACTISING MEDICINE 
A LAWYER'S MISTAKE MAY LOSE THE CASE A DOCTOR'S MISTAKE MAY LOSE A LIFE 
WHATEVER THE VIEW OF THE AUTHORITIES 
THEY WOULD BE ASKED TO TREAT ILLNESSES BUT IF NOT SUCCESSFUL 
WHEN SOME PIONEERING WOMEN BEGAN TO BATTER AT THE DOORS OF THE MALE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT 
APART FROM WRITING AND TEACHING FEW JOBS WERE OPEN TO MIDDLE CLASS WOMEN 
FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE HAD TO FIGHT FOR SEVEN YEARS TO BECOME A NURSE 
THANKS TO HER HOSPITALS ON THE BATTLEFIELD WERE REVOLUTIONISED SHE BECAME THE NATION'S HEROINE 
GREAT SUCCESS ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR 
A WOULD BE DOCTOR ELIZABETH GARRETT 
HAD FOUND A LEGAL LOOPHOLE TO STUDY MEDICINE SHE QUALIFIED AND THE LOOPHOLE WAS SHUT 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY NINE ELIZABETH BLACKWELL WHO HAD STUDIED MEDICINE IN AMERICA AND IN EUROPE 
RETURNED TO BRITAIN TO TAKE UP PRACTICE AS A DOCTOR 
THAT SAME YEAR THIS WOMAN RENEWED THE STRUGGLE FOR WOMEN IN MEDICINE IN BRITAIN SOPHIA JEX BLAKE 
AS YOU WATCH THE NEXT CLIP 
MAKE A LIST OF FACTORS WHICH HELPED BREAK DOWN BARRIERS TO WOMEN 
SOPHIA AND FIVE OTHER WOMEN DID GET INTO EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY 
KEPT APART FROM MALE STUDENTS THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE A DEGREE 
THEIR CAUSE WAS TAKEN UP BY ONE PROFESSOR IN PARTICULAR PROFESSOR MASSON 
THE SEPARATE CLASSES IMPOSE GREAT INCONVENIENCES ON THE WOMEN 
AND ON THE PROFESSORS I PROPOSE THAT IN FUTURE 
WOMEN DESIRING TO STUDY MEDICINE BE ADMITTED TO CLASSES ON THE SAME TERMS AS THE OTHER STUDENTS 
THIS CAUSED AN UPROAR 
I AM SURE THE LADIES NOW ATTENDING THE UNIVERSITY HAVE COME WITH THE PUREST MOTIVES 
BUT HOW WILL THE GENTLEMEN KNOW IF A PROSTITUTE COMES TO THE CLASSES 
WOMEN ARE SEXUALLY MENTALLY AND BODILY UNFITTED 
FOR THE TOIL AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF MEDICAL PRACTICE I KNOW OF NO GREAT DISCOVERY CHANGING SCIENCE 
THAT OWES ITS EXISTENCE TO A WOMAN WHAT RIGHT THEN HAVE WOMEN TO CLAIM MENTAL EQUALITY WITH MEN 
BUT IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX YEARS AFTER SHE HAD BEGUN THE CAMPAIGN 
SOPHIA FINALLY TRIUMPHED IN BRITAIN 
THE GOVERNMENT PASSED AN ACT ENABLING MEDICAL SCHOOLS TO ADMIT WOMEN AND SOME BEGAN TO 
I BELIEVE THAT IF A SINGLE WOMAN DESIRES TO CONSULT A PHYSICIAN OF HER OWN SEX 
AND IF ONE OTHER WOMAN DESIRES TO QUALIFY HERSELF TO BE THAT PHYSICIAN 
NO PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO INTERFERE WITH SUCH LEGITIMATE DESIRES 
YOUR LIST MAY HAVE INCLUDED 
WHICHEVER YOU THOUGHT WAS IMPORTANT YOU SHOULD STRESS THE WAY THEY INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER 
FOR EXAMPLE 
BROUGHT THE ISSUE TO PUBLIC ATTENTION 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON WOMEN AND MEDICINE 
DURING THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
THE GROWTH OF TOWNS TO HOUSE THE EVER GROWING NUMBER OF WORKERS 
CREATED BIG NEW PROBLEMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH 
THE CLIP DESCRIBES SOCIAL CONDITIONS IN BRITISH CITIES IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTIES 
THE FIRST INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION WAS WELL UNDERWAY 
WITH MILLS AND FACTORIES POWERED BY STEAM PRODUCING MORE AND MORE HEAVY GOODS AND TEXTILES 
AS WELL AS THIS THE POPULATION HAD NEARLY DOUBLED IN THIRTY YEARS 
THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH HOMES FOR THE PEOPLE WHO CROWDED INTO THE TOWNS TO WORK IN THE MILLS AND FACTORIES 
MANY WERE FORCED TO LIVE IN CELLARS AND ATTICS 
WORST OF ALL THERE WAS NO EFFECTIVE DRAINAGE OR SEWAGE DISPOSAL 
MANY HAD TO GET WATER FROM PUMPS OFTEN A LONG WAY FROM HOME AND ONLY TURNED ON FOR A FEW HOURS A WEEK 
WHILE THE MUCK THAT LAY AROUND IN THE UNPAVED STREETS WAS SELDOM CARTED AWAY 
IT'S NO WONDER THAT DISEASES LIKE TYPHUS TUBERCULOSIS AND NOW CHOLERA WERE SO DEVASTATING 
YOU SHOULD'VE MADE A NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING 
BUT DURING THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTIES AND FORTIES 
PARLIAMENT BEGAN TO RECOGNISE IT HAD SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH 
COUNCILS COULD PROVIDE CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION IF THEY WISHED 
BUT ATTITUDES CHANGED 
YET EVEN AT THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
THERE WERE STILL VERY HIGH LEVELS OF INFANT MORTALITY 
THE NEW LIBERAL GOVERNMENT WAS READY TO INTERVENE MORE DIRECTLY IN THE HEALTH OF THE NATION 
DURING THE CLIP MAKE A PLAN FOR AN ESSAY ANSWER TO THIS NEXT QUESTION 
IT'S ONE YOU COULD WELL COME UP AGAINST IN THE EXAM 
ARE STILL LIVING IN SLUM CONDITIONS 
THE EFFECT OF POVERTY ON HEALTH WAS STILL VERY OBVIOUS 
COUNCIL RECORDS SHOW AN INCREASE IN DEATH RATES AMONGST VERY YOUNG CHILDREN 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR OUT OF EVERY ONE THOUSAND BABIES HAD DIED 
BY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY NINE IT HAD GONE UP TO ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE BABIES IN ONE THOUSAND 
WHO DIED BEFORE THE AGE OF ONE 
BY NOW WORKING PEOPLE WERE BEGINNING TO GET ORGANISED 
INTO GROUPS WHICH DEMANDED CHANGES 
THE BRITISH EMPIRE ALSO NEEDED MANY MORE ABLE BODIED PEOPLE 
THE GOVERNMENT WANTED TO SEND FIT HEALTHY MEN TO ADMINISTER THE EMPIRE 
THE ARMED FORCES WANTED HEALTH MEASURES BROUGHT IN 
BECAUSE DURING THE BOER WAR FOUGHT FROM ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY NINE TO NINETEEN OH TWO 
MANY RECRUITS HAD NOT BEEN FIT FOR SERVICE 
THE MASSIVE CONCERN FROM ALL SECTIONS OF SOCIETY MEANT 
THAT THE NINETEEN OH SIX LIBERAL GOVERNMENT PASSED NEW LAWS 
OF A KIND THAT HAD NEVER BEEN PASSED BEFORE TO GIVE POOR PEOPLE HELP 
NINETEEN OH SIX SCHOOL MEALS WERE PROVIDED FOR NEEDY CHILDREN NINETEEN OH SEVEN SCHOOLS HAD TO GIVE MEDICALS TO CHILDREN 
ALL BIRTHS HAD TO BE NOTIFIED TO THE HEALTH VISITOR 
NINETEEN OH EIGHT OLD AGE PENSIONS WERE PAID 
NINETEEN OH NINE THE BUILDING OF BACK TO BACK HOUSING WAS BANNED ACROSS BRITAIN 
WHEN THE HOUSEBREAKERS TAKE CHARGE 
YOU CAN REALLY SEE HOW ROTTEN THESE PLACES ARE 
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
THERE WAS LITTLE GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE IN HEALTH MATTERS 
BY THE START OF THE TWENTIETH A LOT 
PEOPLE BEGAN TO ACCEPT THAT POVERTY MIGHT BE THE CAUSE OF DISEASE 
THEY ALSO BEGAN TO ACCEPT THAT POOR PEOPLE COULD NOT BE BLAMED FOR POVERTY 
ESPECIALLY FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE THE VERY YOUNG OR OLD 
CHILDREN NEEDED BETTER NUTRITION AND TO HAVE HEALTH PROBLEMS SPOTTED BEFORE THEY BECAME TOO SERIOUS 
HELPING TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS FOR MILLIONS OF WORKING CLASS FAMILIES 
TO GIVE PEOPLE A MEANS OF SUPPORT WHEN THEY WERE TOO OLD TO WORK 
TO HELP FAMILIES WHO WOULD OTHERWISE GO HUNGRY BECAUSE OF SICKNESS OR UNEMPLOYMENT 
THESE REFORMS WERE A GOOD BEGINNING BUT 
SO AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR THE NEW LABOUR GOVERNMENT PUT FORWARD A PLAN 
AS PART OF AN ATTACK ON THE FIVE PROBLEMS OF WANT IGNORANCE DISEASE SQUALOR AND IDLENESS 
IT WAS PAID FOR OUT OF TAXES AND NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS SO THAT EVERYONE COULD HAVE HEALTH CARE 
REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH THEY EARNED 
I'VE BEEN ASKED TO TELL YOU A LITTLE ABOUT THIS NEW PLAN FOR HEALTH 
OUR PLAN IS A SERVICE WHICH WILL PROVIDE THE BEST MEDICAL ADVICE AND TREATMENT FOR EVERYONE 
EVERY BRITISH MAN WOMAN AND CHILD 
FOR THE FIRST TIME HI TECH SURGERY AND EXPENSIVE DRUGS WERE FREELY AVAILABLE TO POOR PATIENTS 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO RELY ON CHARITY AS MANY HAD IN THE OLD HOSPITALS 
DISEASE MUST BE OVERCOME VOLUNTARY HOSPITALS EXPENSIVE NURSING HOMES CAN'T KEEP THIS NATION IN HEALTH 
THE FINEST SURGERY MUST BE FOR ALL 
DISEASE IS TOO DEEP ROOTED FOR THE HURRIED DIAGNOSIS OF THE ORDINARY DOCTOR AND FOR HIS STOCK MEDICINES 
STATE FUNDS MUST SUBSIDISE RESEARCH 
THE COMPLETELY FREE SERVICE DIDN'T LAST BY NINETEEN FIFTY TWO FOUR YEARS LATER 
PRESCRIPTION CHARGES WERE INTRODUCED AS THE COST OF THE SERVICE BECAME MORE THAN THE GOVERNMENT WOULD PAY 
A SHILLING PER ITEM BUT THE DOCTOR GETS NO MORE COSTS ARE RISING FOR ALL OF US 
THE HEALTHY THE SICK THE CHEMIST THE DOCTOR 
BUT THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE STILL BELIEVED 
ORDINARY PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE VERY LATEST TECHNIQUES 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON PUBLIC HEALTH IN BRITAIN 
SURGERY HAS EXISTED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
BUT IN THE PAST IT WAS USUALLY ONLY USED IN EMERGENCIES 
GENERALLY SURGEONS ONLY CARRIED OUT CERTAIN TYPES OF OPERATIONS 
MOSTLY ON THE BODY'S SURFACE 
CUTTING OFF DISEASED PARTS OF THE BODY 
AND DRILLING HOLES IN THE SKULL TO RELIEVE PRESSURE 
BLEEDING WAS THE MOST COMMON PROCEDURE SOME WERE BLED REGULARLY AS THEY THOUGHT IT DID THEM GOOD 
ALMOST ANY OTHER SURGICAL PROCEDURE WAS LIKELY TO END IN DEATH 
SO DOCTORS AVOIDED SURGERY 
GENERALLY THEY TRIED TO TREAT THE WHOLE BODY 
BY PRESCRIBING MEDICINES DIET AND EXERCISE TO GET IT BACK INTO BALANCE 
THEY DID THIS BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT DISEASE WAS PART OF THE WHOLE WAY YOU LIVED YOUR LIFE 
WHAT YOU ATE WHERE YOU LIVED WHAT WORK YOU DID AND WHAT KIND OF PERSON YOU WERE 
THIS KIND OF MEDICINE CONTINUED RIGHT UP UNTIL THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
BUT BY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY THIS WAY OF THINKING ABOUT ILLNESS BECAME LESS IMPORTANT 
SURGERY BEGAN TO TAKE OVER IT WAS SEEN AS THE BEST ANSWER FOR MANY MEDICAL PROBLEMS 
THE SURGICAL POINT OF VIEW WAS THAT ILLNESS WAS NOT ABOUT THE WHOLE BODY 
IT WAS JUST ABOUT SPECIFIC BITS 
IF YOU HAD A LUMP OR A GROWTH IT WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT PARTICULAR PART 
THE WAY TO TREAT IT WAS TO REMOVE IT YOU DIDN'T NEED TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE PERSON 
YOU JUST HAD TO REMOVE THE PROBLEM 
IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE SOURCES SHOW US THAT PEOPLE WERE BEGINNING TO CHOOSE SURGERY 
RATHER THAN DRUGS OR HERBAL MEDICINES 
SURGICAL TECHNIQUES WERE STILL VERY PRIMITIVE IN THE EARLY EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS 
BUT OVER THE NEXT ONE HUNDRED YEARS THEY IMPROVED VERY RAPIDLY 
THE FIRST BREAKTHROUGH WAS IN ANAESTHESIA 
THE USE FIRST OF LAUGHING GAS TO REDUCE PAIN 
AND THEN IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTIES ETHER OR CHLOROFORM 
ANTISEPTICS GREATLY REDUCED THE RISK 
OF INFECTION DURING SURGERY 
WHEN IT HAD BEEN SHOWN BY THE RESEARCHERS OF MONSIEUR PASTEUR 
THAT THE POISONOUS PROPERTY OF THE AIR DEPENDED ON MINUTE ORGANISMS SUSPENDED IN IT 
IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT INFECTION OF THE WOUNDS MIGHT BE AVOIDED 
BY APPLYING AS A DRESSING SOMETHING CAPABLE OF KILLING THESE FLOATING PARTICLES 
THAT WAS JOSEPH LISTER AN ENGLISH SURGEON WRITING IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN FOR YEARS HE HAD BEEN WORRIED 
ABOUT THE HIGH DEATH RATE OF PATIENTS 
WHOSE WOUNDS TURNED SEPTIC AFTER OPERATIONS 
SO WHEN A PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY TOLD HIM ABOUT PASTEUR'S WORK 
HE SEIZED ON THE IDEA THAT MICRO ORGANISMS MIGHT CARRY INFECTION 
FILL THE RESERVOIR WITH CARBOLIC ACID PLEASE MR. LEESON 
IF HE COULD KILL THEM HE MIGHT PREVENT WOUNDS FROM BECOMING INFECTED 
HE KNEW CARBOLIC ACID HAD RECENTLY BEEN USED 
TO MAKE SEWAGE SAFE AS A FERTILISER 
DID IT WORK BY KILLING MICRO ORGANISMS AND IF SO WOULD IT WORK FOR PATIENTS 
FROM ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE HE EXPERIMENTED IN DIFFERENT WAYS INCLUDING INVENTING A CARBOLIC SPRAY 
TURN ON THE SPRAYING MECHANISM 
PLEASE MR. LEESON 
THE WHOLE SCENE OF THE OPERATION OR DRESSING WAS ENVELOPED IN THIS SPRAY 
IT WENT INTO EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY OF THE WOUND 
OUR FACES AND COAT SLEEVES OFTEN DRIPPED WITH IT 
NEEDLESS TO SAY THE CARBOLIC ACID 
MADE SAD WORK OF OUR HANDS WHICH WERE ALWAYS ROUGH AND CRACKED 
CARBOLIC ACID HAD ITS DANGERS 
BUT LISTER WAS ON THE RIGHT LINES 
IN A FEW YEARS 
THE DEATH RATE FROM OPERATIONS HAD GONE DOWN SPECTACULARLY 
THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION ALSO MEANT BETTER INSTRUMENTS 
AND NEW WAYS OF WORKING FOR THE SURGEONS 
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS HAD STAYED THE SAME 
THE KIND OF INSTRUMENTS USED BY THE ANCIENT ROMANS 
WOULD BE RECOGNISED BY ANY SURGEON EVEN TODAY 
BUT IN THE NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CENTURIES 
SURGEONS CREATED MANY NEW DEVICES TO HELP THEM TO CARRY OUT VERY DRAMATIC NEW OPERATIONS 
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTEEN THE STETHOSCOPE 
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY THE STEAM CARBOLIC SPRAY 
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FIVE X. RAYS 
THEY COULD NOW BEGIN TO GO DEEP INTO THE BODY 
DEVELOPING THE ANAESTHETICS TO LESSEN THE PAIN OF OPERATIONS 
ANTISEPTICS TO KEEP THE WOUNDS CLEAN 
AND METHODS OF PREVENTING BLOOD LOSS TO STOP THE BODY GOING INTO SHOCK 
AFTER THE WAR THE SURGICAL REVOLUTION SPEEDED UP YET AGAIN 
IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND NINETEEN SIXTIES VAST AMOUNTS OF MONEY WERE SPENT TO ALLOW SURGEONS 
TO PIONEER DRAMATIC NEW OPERATIONS SUCH AS WAYS OF OPERATING ON THE HEART 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HEART LUNG MACHINE WAS A MAJOR STEP FORWARD 
NOW SURGEONS COULD OPERATE ON THE HEART FOR MUCH LONGER FOR HOURS IF NECESSARY 
IT'S JUST BEHIND 
ENABLING THE PATIENT TO BE KEPT PERFECTLY ASLEEP 
THIS MADE IT POSSIBLE 
FOR THE FIRST HEART TRANSPLANT 
TO TAKE PLACE IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN 
IT'S WORKING IT'S JUST BEING WARMED UP NOW BEING FILLED 
THERE'S THE PUMP AND THE VARIOUS OTHER PARTS OF IT 
IT'S GOING TO BE FILLED OF COURSE WITH BLOOD FROM BLOOD DONORS 
SOME HAS BEEN PUT IN ALREADY 
BY NOW IT FELT LIKE SURGEONS COULD DO ANYTHING 
SURGERY WAS NOW SEEN AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF MEDICINE 
INSTEAD OF THE POOR RELATION IT HAD BEEN FOR MOST OF HISTORY 
WHEN YOU COME TO DO YOUR REVISION 
YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK NOT JUST FOR THE DETAILS WHAT GALEN DID 
WHAT HARVEY DID BUT FOR THE BIG PICTURE 
YES YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT VESALIUS HARVEY LISTER 
THOSE DISCOVERIES AT THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
BUT WHAT'S THE BIG PATTERN WHAT IS THE FLOW OF EVENTS 
HOW DID VESALIUS AND HARVEY CHANGE THINGS 
AND WHY AT THE END OF THE NINETEENTH C. WERE THERE SUCH BIG CHANGES 
NOT JUST WHAT EACH INDIVIDUAL DID 
BUT HOW IT ALL ADDS UP TOGETHER TO A PATTERN OVER THOSE YEARS 
THAT'S THE END OF THE FIRST PART OF THE PROGRAMME ON MEDICINE THROUGH TIME 
DON'T FORGET YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION 
IN THE GCSE BITESIZE BOOKS AND ON THE WEBSITE 
THE SECOND PART OF THIS PROGRAMME 
FOCUSES ON THE AMERICAN WEST MODULE OF THE GCSE HISTORY SYLLABUS 
A STUDY IN DEPTH IS VERY DIFFERENT 
FROM A DEVELOPMENT STUDY LIKE THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE 
IN THIS KIND OF STUDY YOU ONLY COVER A SHORT PERIOD 
IN THIS CASE FROM ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FIVE AND ONE PLACE 
THE GREAT PLAINS OF THE U. S. A. 
BUT IN MUCH GREATER DEPTH 
AT THE HEART OF THIS STUDY IN DEPTH ON THE AMERICAN WEST 
IS A TREMENDOUS CULTURE CLASH 
BETWEEN THE PLAINS INDIANS AND PEOPLE FROM THE EASTERN U. S. A. 
IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY THREE THE BRITISH WHO NOW RULED THIS PART OF AMERICA 
ESTABLISHED A FRONTIER ALONG THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS 
THE SETTLERS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO ADVANCE BEYOND THIS LINE 
ALL THE LAND TO THE WEST OF IT WAS LEFT IN THE HANDS OF THE INDIANS 
BUT IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE THE NEW LEADERS OF THE UNITED STATES TOOK OVER FROM THE BRITISH 
THEY OPENED UP THE FRONTIER AGAIN AND LET THE SETTLERS THROUGH 
A LAW WAS ALSO PASSED THAT INDIAN LAND COULD ONLY BE BOUGHT BY THE GOVERNMENT 
OVER THE NEXT NINETY YEARS 
INDIANS WERE FORCED TO MAKE TREATIES 
WHICH GAVE THE WHITES CONTROL OVER HUGE AREAS OF THEIR LAND 
BY THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTIES THE ONLY LARGE PART OF AMERICA STILL HELD BY THE INDIANS WAS THE GREAT PLAINS 
HERE TRIBES SUCH AS THE SIOUX THE CHEYENNE AND THE ARAPAHO 
HAD BEGUN TO USE HORSES AND GUNS 
SO WHO WERE THESE PLAINS INDIANS 
AND WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE WERE THEY 
THE GREAT PLAINS IS A VERY HARSH ENVIRONMENT 
FIERCELY HOT IN SUMMER BITTERLY COLD IN WINTER 
AND SOMETIMES SWEPT BY HIGH WINDS AND TORNADOES 
TO THE WEST THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS TWO HUNDRED MILES WIDE RISE TO FOURTEEN ZERO ZERO ZERO F. T. 
BUT THE PLAINS INDIANS HAD DEVELOPED A NOMADIC WAY OF LIFE WELL ADAPTED TO THIS ENVIRONMENT 
IN THE OLDEN DAYS THE INDIAN COMMUNICATED TO HIS MAKER THE GREAT SPIRIT 
THROUGH THE VARIOUS ANIMALS 
EAGLES BEARS AND OF COURSE BUFFALOES WOLVES 
THAT THE GREAT SPIRIT GIVES THEM 
BUT THE HUMAN BEINGS WERE NOT SO BLESSED 
SO IN ORDER TO GET POWER BLESSINGS OF THE GREAT SPIRIT THEY GOTTA GO THROUGH THE ANIMALS 
SO WHEN THEY HAVE A VISION CONCERNING A BUFFALO OR A BEAR OR SOMETHING 
THEY REGARD THAT PARTICULAR ANIMAL AS THEIR PROTECTOR 
I WOULD SAY THAT UNTIL RECENTLY 
THE CROW INDIAN REGARDED EARTH AS HIS FIRST AND ORIGINAL MOTHER 
AND THE HUMAN MOTHER AS JUST TEMPORARY 
AND EVENTUALLY THE CROW INDIAN WILL GO BACK TO HIS FIRST MOTHER EARTH 
AND THEIR THINKING IS WHILE YOU'RE HERE ON MOTHER EARTH'S BOSOM 
YOU SHOULD TREAT IT NICELY DON'T ABUSE IT 
AND TREAT YOUR MOTHER KINDLY AND IT WILL TREAT YOU KINDLY IN RETURN 
THIS VIEW HAS PARALLELS 
WITH THAT OF MODERN ENVIRONMENTALISTS 
BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT ITEM IN THE INDIANS' ENVIRONMENT 
WAS THE HUGE HERDS OF AMERICAN BISON OR BUFFALO 
WHILE YOU WATCH THE NEXT CLIP 
MAKE NOTES ON THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH THE PLAINS INDIANS' WAY OF LIFE DEPENDED ON THE BUFFALO 
YOU'LL FIND THEM HELPFUL WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR NEXT SAMPLE QUESTION 
THE PLAINS WERE DOMINATED BY TWO SPECIES 
WHICH FORMED THE CULTURE THAT LASTED FOR CENTURIES ONE WAS MAN 
THIS IS A PAWNEE WARRIOR BUFFALO BULL 
HIS FACE PAINTED WITH THE SIGN OF THE BUFFALO HIS FELLOW CREATURES OF THE PLAIN 
IN THE SOUTH THE APACHE AND FURTHER NORTH THE CHEYENNE 
THE CROW AND THE SIOUX ALL DEPENDED FOR THEIR LIVING ON THE BISON HERD 
WITH A LITTLE BOW LIKE THIS ONE 
AND THE BOW ITSELF IS MADE FROM 
PARTS OF THE ANIMAL THE BASIS OF THE BOW IS WOOD 
AND IN THIS CASE IT'S ASH A LOCAL HARDWOOD 
BUT THE STRENGTH OF THE BOW 
COMES FROM A LAYER OF SINEW 
GLUED ONTO THE BACK OF THE BOW 
IN THIS CASE WHICH IS A BIT EXCEPTIONAL 
THE ENTIRE BOW IS ENCASED IN INTESTINE 
TO FURTHER WATERPROOF IT EVEN THE BOWSTRING IS MADE FROM TWISTED SINEW 
VILLAGE LIFE DEPENDED ON THE BISON IN MORE PEACEFUL WAYS 
STRIPS OF MEAT HUNG DRYING OUTSIDE THE TEEPEE OR LODGE 
THE FAMILY CLOTHES WERE BUFFALO HIDE AND THE HORSE TRAPPINGS WERE HIDE TOO 
THIS CROW LODGE IS MADE OF TWENTY FIVE BUFFALO SKINS SEWN WITH SINEW BY THE WOMEN 
LODGES WERE RAPIDLY STRIPPED AND REASSEMBLED AS THE TRIBE FOLLOWED THE HERDS 
WHILE YOU WATCH THE CLIP ASK YOURSELF 
WHAT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT WEAPON 
THE EASTERNERS USED 
TO DEFEAT THE INDIANS 
THE WAGON TRAINS CROSSING THE AREA ON THE WAY TO CALIFORNIA DISRUPTED THE VAST HERDS OF BUFFALO 
AND MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE INDIANS TO HUNT 
DRIVEN CLOSE TO STARVATION THE PLAINS TRIBES STARTED TO FIGHT BACK 
FOR ALMOST THE FIRST TIME 
THE UNITED STATES FOUND ITSELF IN A PROLONGED WAR WITH THE INDIANS 
FROM NOW ON THE WHITE POPULATION OF AMERICA WOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER THE INDIAN AS THE BLOODTHIRSTY SAVAGE 
THE ARMY HAD FAILED TO DEFEAT THE PLAINS TRIBES 
AND SO THE U. S. GOVERNMENT TRIED SOMETHING ELSE 
SOMETHING LESS EXPENSIVE 
THE GOVERNMENT TOLD WHITE HUNTERS TO GO OUT AND DESTROY THE INDIANS' MAIN FOOD SUPPLY 
THE BUFFALO 
ROTTING BUFFALO CARCASSES LITTERED THE PLAINS 
THEY WERE STACKED AT RAILHEADS TO BE SHIPPED TO FACTORIES TO MAKE FERTILISER AND EXPLOSIVES 
IN THE MID EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS THERE WERE ABOUT SIXTY MILLION BUFFALO IN THE UNITED STATES 
BY NINETEEN TEN THERE WERE THOUGHT TO BE JUST EIGHTY FIVE LEFT 
IN KILLING THE BUFFALO 
THE WHITES HAD DESTROYED THE INDIANS' WHOLE WAY OF LIFE 
COMING UP IS A TYPICAL EXAM QUESTION ABOUT THE PLAINS INDIANS 
SO DON'T HANG ABOUT 
WHAT FOUR POINTS ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE 
IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET 
YOU'LL FIND FURTHER SOURCE MATERIAL ON NATIVE AMERICANS 
AND SAMPLE EXAM QUESTIONS ON THE BITESIZE HISTORY SITE 
TRY AND REMEMBER THE ORDER OF EVENTS RATHER THAN THE DATES 
IT'LL HELP YOU TO NOT GET MIXED UP 
ALSO THINK OF PICTURES IN YOUR HEAD OF EVENTS IT'LL HELP YOU REMEMBER 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON THE PLAINS INDIANS 
THE CLASH OF CULTURES BETWEEN PLAINS INDIANS AND EASTERNERS 
WENT BACK TO THE FIRST CONTACT BETWEEN NATIVE AMERICANS 
AND THE FIRST EUROPEAN SETTLERS IN THE EARLY SIXTEEN HUNDREDS 
JOT DOWN THE MAIN DIFFERENCES YOU NOTICE 
BETWEEN THE SETTLERS' ATTITUDE TO LAND 
AND THAT OF THE NATIVE AMERICANS 
EUROPEANS BELIEVED THAT THEY HAD COME TO A WILDERNESS 
THEY COULD NOT SEE THAT MANY NATIVE PEOPLE HAD A SUCCESSFUL WAY OF LIFE 
BASED ON CAREFUL USE OF THE ENVIRONMENT 
THE INDIANS ROAMED THE COUNTRYSIDE HUNTING HARVESTING WILD FOODS AND SOMETIMES GROWING CROPS 
BUT BECAUSE THE EUROPEANS COULDN'T SEE THE KIND OF FARMS THEY WERE USED TO 
THEY THOUGHT THE INDIANS WEREN'T USING THE LAND PROPERLY 
THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM EUROPEAN FARMING METHODS AND ANIMALS 
AND CHANGED THE NEW ENGLAND OF HUNTING AND HARVESTING INTO ONE OF ORGANISED FARMLAND 
AND FENCES 
THE PURITANS WERE PARTICULARLY KEEN ON FENCES 
BECAUSE THEY SHOWED EVERYBODY THAT THEY OWNED THE LAND 
THE FIRST EASTERNERS TO TRAVEL WEST 
WERE FUR TRAPPERS NOT ALL WERE WHITE 
JAMES P. BECKWOURTH FOR EXAMPLE WAS HALF BLACK 
THEY WERE NOT A THREAT TO NATIVES AND USUALLY GOT ON WELL WITH THEM 
DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE NINETEENTH C. 
THE U. S. EXPANDED STEADILY WESTWARDS 
BUYING SEIZING OR CONQUERING LAND 
FROM FRANCE MEXICO AND BRITAIN 
BY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT THE U. S. CONTROLLED 
ALL NORTH AMERICA BETWEEN MEXICO AND CANADA 
BY THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTIES EASTERNERS WERE MOVING INTO THE PLAINS IN MUCH GREATER NUMBERS IN GREAT WAGON TRAINS 
TO GET TO CALIFORNIA IN THE WEST TO MINE OR TO HUNT BUFFALO 
BEFORE THE RAILROADS ALL TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS ACROSS THE HUGE DISTANCES OF THE WEST 
WAS BY HORSE WAGON TRAIN OR STAGECOACH AND WAS DIFFICULT DANGEROUS AND SLOW 
THE STAGECOACH FROM CALIFORNIA TO SAINT LOUIS TOOK TWENTY FIVE DAYS 
IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTIES THE TELEGRAPH CAME 
ENABLING MESSAGES TO GET FROM COAST TO COAST IN A DAY 
THEN THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDED A SUBSIDY TO TWO RAILROAD COMPANIES 
TO BUILD A LINE ACROSS THE WEST 
THE WEST TO EAST CENTRAL PACIFIC AND THE EAST TO WEST UNION PACIFIC 
MET IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY NINE IN UTAH OTHER RAIL LINKS SOON FOLLOWED 
THE OPENING OF THE RAILROADS BROUGHT BIG CHANGES 
THERE WAS NOW A WAY OF TRANSPORTING BEEF TO MARKETS IN THE EAST 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON PIONEERS AND TRANSPORT 
AFTER THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR OF ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY TO SIXTY FIVE 
THREE THINGS BROUGHT ABOUT A BOOM IN THE CATTLE BUSINESS ON THE PLAINS 
DURING THE WAR CATTLE IN THE SOUTH WERE ALLOWED TO BREED UNCONTROLLED 
CATTLE WERE BROUGHT TO THE PLAINS 
FROM THE SOUTH ALONG CATTLE TRAILS UP TO ONE FIVE HUNDRED K. M. LONG 
THE TRAILS ENDED AT RAILROAD HEADS 
WHERE CATTLE WERE TAKEN EAST ON TRAINS 
THE MAIN CATTLE TRAINS WERE 
THE SEDALIA TRAIL FROM TEXAS TO MISSOURI 
THE CHISUM TRAIL WHICH BY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE WAS BRINGING SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND HEAD OF CATTLE 
TO ABILENE KANSAS EACH YEAR 
THE WESTERN TRAIL TO DODGE CITY KANSAS 
AND THE GOODNIGHT LOVING TRAIL 
STRIKING OUT WEST TOWARDS THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS 
THIS IS A CLIP FROM FOOTAGE FILMED EARLY THIS CENTURY 
IT IS IN FACT ONE OF THE EARLIEST DOCUMENTARIES 
CATTLE DRIVING WAS HARD SKILLED WORK 
UP TO TWENTY COWBOYS LOOKED AFTER A HERD SPENDING MOST OF THE DAY IN THE SADDLE AND SLEEPING IN THE OPEN 
THEY HAD TO CONTEND WITH STAMPEDES BAD WEATHER DUST STORMS 
AND ATTACKS FROM RUSTLERS NATIVE AMERICANS AND HOMESTEADERS 
MOST EARLY COWBOYS WERE FROM TEXAS THEY INCLUDED BLACK AMERICANS AND MANY MEXICANS 
AFTER ALL WHY TRAIL CATTLE FROM TEXAS 
WHEN THEY COULD BE FARMED ON RANCHES NEAR THE RAILHEADS 
AS THE BUFFALO HERDS WERE DESTROYED 
THERE WERE VAST AREAS OF LAND AVAILABLE 
THE CATTLE RANCHERS REGARDED THE LAND AS UNUSED AND SIMPLY TOOK IT 
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS OFTEN PART OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN LANDS 
THEY LET CATTLE WANDER AT WILL OVER THE OPEN RANGE AS THEY CALLED IT 
EVERY SPRING AND AUTUMN THEY WERE ROUNDED UP BY THE COWBOYS 
CATTLE WERE SEPARATED AND THE CALVES BRANDED WITH THE BRAND OF THE RANCH THEY BELONGED TO 
SO MUCH MONEY COULD BE MADE THAT PEOPLE FLOCKED TO SET UP RANCHES 
BY THE LATE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTIES THE RANGES BECAME OVERCROWDED AND THE POOR GRASS OF THE PLAINS HAD BECOME OVERGRAZED 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX AND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN BAD WINTERS WITH TERRIBLE BLIZZARDS KILLED OFF THOUSANDS OF CATTLE 
UP TO ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY THE GREAT PLAINS WERE CONSIDERED UNINHABITABLE 
AND UNSUITABLE FOR FARMING 
BUT THEN FARMERS CALLED HOMESTEADERS FROM THE NEW HOUSES OR HOMESTEADS THEY HAD TO BUILD 
BEGAN TO SETTLE AND FARM LAND IN THE WEST 
THERE WERE SEVERAL REASONS FOR THIS 
LAND HUNGRY PIONEERS DRIFTED WEST 
THEY INCLUDED BLACK EX SLAVES GERMANS NORWEGIANS AND SWEDES 
AS WELL AS ENGLISH SPEAKING WHITES 
THE ACT SAID ANY MALE COULD HAVE THE LAND 
IF HE BUILT A HOUSE ON IT AND FARMED THE LAND FOR FIVE YEARS 
HOMESTEADING WAS A HARD LIFE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY ACRES WAS NOT REALLY ENOUGH FOR A FAMILY TO LIVE ON 
THERE WAS A SHORTAGE OF TIMBER FOR BUILDING AND FUEL 
THERE WAS A SHORTAGE OF WATER AND DIGGING WELLS WAS A BACKBREAKING TASK 
AND NEW FARM MACHINERY HELPED BRING LARGE FARMS INTO CULTIVATION 
AGAIN THERE'S MORE SOURCE MATERIAL 
ON SETTLEMENT IN THE WEST 
ON THE BITESIZE HISTORY ONLINE SITE 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON CATTLE RANCHERS AND HOMESTEADERS 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THE U. S. GOVERNMENT BELIEVED THE WEST WAS A USELESS DESERT 
THIS MEANT THAT AT THE TIME 
THEY SAW A LIMIT TO U. S. EXPANSION WESTWARDS 
BY THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTIES TENSION WAS RISING 
AS MORE AND MORE EASTERNERS 
MOVED INTO THE PLAINS 
AND THE U. S. GOVERNMENT STEPPED IN 
FOR ALMOST THE FIRST TIME 
THE UNITED STATES FOUND ITSELF IN A PROLONGED WAR WITH THE INDIANS 
THE INDIANS WOULD MUTILATE THEIR VICTIMS BECAUSE 
ACCORDING TO INDIAN BELIEFS THE WHITES WOULD THEN BE REBORN DISABLED IN THEIR NEXT LIFE 
AS STORIES OF INDIANS KILLING WHITES SPREAD THE WHITES LOST PATIENCE 
IT WAS EASY TO FORGET THAT WHITES HAD BEEN MASSACRING INDIANS FOR GENERATIONS 
THE BATTLE FOR THE PLAINS COST THE UNITED STATES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
AND LED TO AMERICA'S ONLY DEFEAT IN A WAR AGAINST THE INDIANS 
WHEN AGLALA SIOUX LEADER RED CLOUD 
FORCED THE GOVERNMENT TO SIGN A PEACE TREATY 
A NUMBER OF TREATIES WERE SIGNED TO TRY TO PREVENT FURTHER CONFLICT 
THE TREATY HANDED OVER CERTAIN AREAS NEAR THE MIGRANT TRAILS TO EASTERNERS 
IN RETURN THE NATIVE AMERICANS 
WERE GUARANTEED LARGE BUT SEPARATE TRIBAL RESERVATIONS 
THE TREATY OF MEDICINE LODGE CREEK 
FORCED MOST NATIVE AMERICANS APART FROM THE SIOUX 
TO SETTLE IN A NUMBER OF SMALLER SCATTERED RESERVATIONS 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT AFTER A REVOLT BY THE SIOUX UNDER CHIEF RED CLOUD 
A NEW FORT LARAMIE TREATY GUARANTEED A LARGE AREA OF LAND TO THE SIOUX 
INCLUDING THE SACRED BLACK HILLS 
ULTIMATELY THE TREATIES DID NOTHING TO STOP A WAR TO THE FINISH 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR A COLONEL OF MILITIA JOHN CHIVINGTON 
MASSACRED BLACK KETTLE'S TRIBE OF OVER ONE HUNDRED MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN 
CHIVINGTON WAS NOT A SOLDIER 
BUT THE SOLDIERS PAID A TERRIBLE PRICE FOR HIS BUTCHERY 
THE SLAUGHTER CONTINUED ON SIDES 
AFTER A BLOODY REVOLT 
THE WARLIKE SIOUX WERE IMPRISONED IN THEIR LODGES 
THEIR LEADERS WERE HANGED 
THE SIOUX HELD THIS TERRITORY SACRED AND BELIEVED IT WAS THEIRS FOR EVER 
BY TREATY WITH THE UNITED STATES 
BUT THE BLACK HILLS WERE NOT SACRED TO THE GOVERNMENT THEY COULD BE VALUABLE 
GEORGE ARMSTRONG CUSTER WENT TO THE BLACK HILLS TO INVESTIGATE RUMOURS OF GOLD 
HIS EXPEDITION WAS GIVEN ALL THE PUBLICITY THAT HE CRAVED 
IN THAT YEAR OF ECONOMIC SLUMP 
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THE CAMP FOLLOWERS WERE CLOSE BEHIND STILL SEEKING THEIR FORTUNES 
THE HUNTERS FOLLOWED THE PROSPECTORS 
INTO SIOUX TERRITORY THERE WERE STILL HERDS IN THE MISSOURI VALLEY FOR THEM TO HUNT 
A MAN NAMED AFTER THE BUFFALO SAW A VISION 
SITTING BULL DREAMED THAT HIS PEOPLE WOULD DESTROY THE INVADING WHITES 
HE FASTED AND PRAYED CUT FLESH FROM HIS BODY AND OFFERED IT IN SACRIFICE FOR VICTORY 
GEORGE ARMSTRONG CUSTER PARADED HIS SEVENTH CAVALRY 
AND RODE OUT TO SUBDUE THE INDIANS 
THE SIOUX NATIONS AND THE CHEYENNE CAMPED TOGETHER IN MONTANA TERRITORY 
SEVERAL THOUSAND WARRIORS DREAMED SITTING BULL'S DREAM 
THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN TWO CULTURES TOOK PLACE IN JUNE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX 
IN THE VALLEY OF THE LITTLE BIGHORN RIVER 
THE WAR PARTIES CAMPED ACROSS THE RIVER 
SWEPT OVER THIS FORD AND OVERWHELMED THE SOLDIERS 
WHO WERE SACRIFICED TO CUSTER'S ARROGANT INCOMPETENCE 
NOT ONE SOLDIER SURVIVED 
THE GOVERNMENT POURED REINFORCEMENTS INTO THE PLAINS 
THE SIOUX AND CHEYENNE WERE HEAVILY OUTNUMBERED AND DESPERATELY SHORT OF FOOD 
AND GRADUALLY THE ARMY BROUGHT THEM IN TO RESERVATION COMPOUNDS 
WHERE THEY WERE IMPRISONED 
THE WHITE MAN MADE US MANY PROMISES MORE THAN I CAN REMEMBER 
BUT THEY NEVER KEPT BUT ONE 
THEY PROMISED TO TAKE OUR LAND AND THEY TOOK IT 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT A NEVADA PAIUTE CALLED WOVOKA HAD A VISION 
GOD TOLD HIM THAT BY DANCING AND PERFORMING CERTAIN RITUALS 
INDIANS COULD BRING BACK THEIR OLD WAY OF LIFE 
WOVOKA AND HIS FOLLOWERS BELIEVED THAT THEIR DANCING WOULD MAKE THE GROUND ROLL UP LIKE A CARPET 
TAKING THE WHITES WITH IT 
AND THAT THE DEAD INDIANS AND THEIR ANIMALS WOULD RETURN 
IN A LAST FRENZIED EFFORT TO PRESERVE THEIR WAY OF LIFE 
TRIBES PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE WEST DANCED AND SANG FOR SUPERNATURAL HELP 
RIFLE FIRE 
THE HELP THEY DANCED AND SANG FOR NEVER CAME 
IN DECEMBER ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY 
SOLDIERS OPENED FIRE ON A GROUP OF UNARMED SIOUX AT WOUNDED KNEE SOUTH DAKOTA 
MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE KILLED 
BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF COLUMBUS 
THERE WERE MORE THAN FIVE MILLION INDIANS IN AMERICA 
BY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY THERE WERE ONLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
DURING THE SAME PERIOD 
THE WHITE POPULATION INCREASED FROM ZERO TO SEVENTY FIVE MILLION 
HERE'S THE KIND OF QUESTION YOU COULD BE ASKED ABOUT THE DEFEAT OF THE PLAINS INDIANS 
THIS QUESTION CARRIES SIXTEEN MARKS 
NOW STOP THE TAPE AND HAVE A GO YOURSELF 
DON'T GET TOO HUNG UP ON THE DETAILS OF THE EVENTS THEMSELVES 
USE THEM AS MARKERS FOR KEY CHANGES 
IN THE EASTERNERS' ATTITUDES TOWARDS NATIVE AMERICANS 
HERE ARE THE POINTS YOU OUGHT TO BE THINKING OF 
THE AGREEMENTS OF ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR AND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY ONE WERE BROKEN 
WHEN I'M WORKING ON SCRIPTS 
I USE HIGHLIGHTER PENS TO PINPOINT IMPORTANT THINGS 
THAT CAN HELP WITH YOUR REVISION WHATEVER YOU'RE LEARNING FOR 
I AM SURE HIGHLIGHTING IMPORTANT PHRASES OR TIME LINES 
WILL HELP YOU LEARN THEM AND REMEMBER THEM IN THE EXAMS 
YOU SHOULD NOW BE MUCH MORE CONFIDENT 
ABOUT ANSWERING QUESTIONS IN YOUR GCSE HISTORY EXAM 
ON BOTH MEDICINE THROUGH TIME AND THE AMERICAN WEST 
THIS PROGRAMME SHOULD ALSO HAVE GIVEN YOU SOME PRACTICE IN 
THAT'S THE END OF THE PROGRAMME ON SCHOOLS' HISTORY PROJECT 
LOOKING AT MEDICINE THROUGH TIME AND THE AMERICAN WEST 
THE OTHER TWO PROGRAMMES ARE
