THIS IS A STORY ABOUT A SIXTEENTH CENTURY COUNTRY PRIEST 
AND THE EXTRAORDINARY RECORDS HE KEPT 
IT DEALS WITH ORDINARY PEOPLE IN AN UNIMPORTANT PLACE 
WHOSE CLAIM TO FAME IS THAT 
THEY LIVED THROUGH THE MOST DECISIVE REVOLUTION IN ENGLISH HISTORY 
AND HAD A PRIEST WHO WROTE IT ALL DOWN 
THE VOICES OF MOREBATH IS ABOUT A SMALL DEVON VILLAGE 
OVER THE MOST TRAUMATIC AND REVOLUTIONARY 
FIFTY YEARS OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR LIFESTYLE BECAUSE OF THE REFORMATION 
THE CENTRE OF THE STORY THE CENTRE OF THE VILLAGE 
IS A PRIEST SIR CHRISTOPHER TRYCHAY 
PRIESTS WERE CALLED SIR AS NOW THEY'RE CALLED FATHER 
WHO KEPT THE PARISH ACCOUNTS WHICH HE READ OUT TO HIS PARISHIONERS 
AND INTO WHICH HE PUT THE STORY OF ALL THEIR COMMON CONCERNS 
I DESIRE YOU THAT YOU WILL LAY FORTH THIS MONEY AGAIN 
OF THE CHURCH STOCK IN REMEMBRANCE OF 
SIR CHRISTOPHER'S VOICE COMES ACROSS IN THE ACCOUNTS AS PUNCTILIOUS 
SLIGHTLY SELF ASSERTIVE A LITTLE CANTANKEROUS 
BUT SOMEBODY PASSIONATELY ENGAGED IN EVERY MINUTE DETAIL 
OF THE COMMUNITY'S LIFE 
SIR CHRISTOPHER CAME TO MOREBATH IN THE SUMMER OF ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY 
AND SAW HIMSELF AS A MUCH NEEDED BREATH OF FRESH AIR FOR MOREBATH 
FROM THE MOMENT OF HIS ARRIVAL 
HE FLUNG HIMSELF INTO A FLURRY OF ACTIVITY 
WHICH OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS WOULD GATHER AND GROW 
UNTIL IT RESEMBLED NOT SO MUCH A BREATH AS A GALE 
AND WHICH SIMULTANEOUSLY TRANSFORMED THE INTERIOR OF HIS CHURCH 
AND THE DEVOTIONAL LIFE OF HIS PARISH 
MOREBATH CHURCH NOW IS WELL KEPT BUT RATHER BARE 
VERY DIFFERENT IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
PAINTED AND GILDED STATUES OF SAINTS 
AND THESE SAINTS WERE NOT JUST FURNITURE THEY WERE INVOKED BY NAME 
WOMEN PUT FLOWERS GAVE THEIR ROSARIES TO THE STATUES 
SO MOREBATH'S PEOPLE FELT THEMSELVES SURROUNDED BY HEAVENLY HOSTS 
WHO WERE ON THEIR SIDE 
SIR CHRISTOPHER HIMSELF WAS PASSIONATELY DEVOTED TO THE CULT OF THE SAINTS 
THE HEART OF THE REFORMATION UNDER HENRY THE EIGHTH 
IN MOREBATH THE REFORMATION REALLY BEGINS TO EFFECT THE PARISH 
FROM ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT ONWARDS WITH THE ATTACK WHICH HENRY ORDERED 
ON THE CULT OF THE SAINTS 
THEY'RE ORDERED TO PUT OUT THE LIGHTS IN FRONT OF THE SAINTS 
TO STOP INVOKING THEM 
THE PARISHIONERS WERE TOLD THAT THEY MUST NOT REPOSE THEIR TRUST 
AND AFFIANCE IN ANY OTHER WORKS DEVISED BY MEN'S FANTASIES 
BESIDES SCRIPTURE AS IN OFFERING OF MONEY CANDLES OR TAPERS 
TO IMAGES OR RELICS OR KISSING OR LICKING THE SAME 
SAYING OVER A NUMBER OF BEADS OR IN SUCH LIKE SUPERSTITION 
WELL SIR CHRISTOPHER HAD BEEN ENCOURAGING HIS PARISHIONERS TO DO EXACTLY THESE THINGS 
FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS SO THOSE WORDS MUST HAVE BEEN SO MANY ARROWS IN HIS HEART 
THE DEATH OF HENRY THE EIGHTH AND THE ACCESSION OF HIS NINE YEAR OLD SON 
EDWARD THE SIXTH WHO'D BEEN RAISED A PROTESTANT 
EDWARD'S GOVERNMENT BEGAN TO IMPLEMENT A VERY DRASTIC PROTESTANTISING 
THE STRIPPING OUT OF IMAGES THE WHITE WASHING OF PAINTINGS 
A COMPLETE CULTURAL REVOLUTION 
AT THE ROOT OF IT ALL WAS RELIGION 
AND THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF RAPID RELIGIOUS CHANGE 
IMPLICIT IN THE ADVANCE OF PROTESTANTISM 
MORE RADICAL THAN ANYTHING MOREBATH OR ANY OTHER PARISH IN DEVON 
HAD EVER CONTEMPLATED EVEN IN NIGHTMARE 
BY ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THE PROCESS OF REFORMATION HAD BEEN SO TRAUMATIC 
THAT THE WHOLE OF THE WEST COUNTRY ROSE IN REBELLION 
AND FIVE YOUNG MEN WERE SENT OUT FROM THIS CHURCH TO BESIEGE THE CITY OF EXETER 
TO JOIN THE REBELS THERE 
ONE OF THE GREAT PARADOXES OF THE ACCOUNT IS THAT 
HE ACTUALLY DOCUMENTS THE COMMUNITY COMMITTING HIGH TREASON 
AND HE DID THAT BECAUSE THEY SPENT MONEY TO DO IT 
AND ALL MONEY HAD TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR 
AND SIR CHRISTOPHER HAD WRITTEN DOWN THE DETAILS USING THE WORD CAMP 
AT THEIR GOING FORTH TO SAINT DAVID'S DOWN CAMP 
AND IN THE SUMMER OF ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THE WORD CAMP MEANT REBEL CAMP 
BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT ALMOST THE WHOLE COUNTY WAS INVOLVED IN IT 
AND SINCE EVERYONE WAS DOING IT 
MOREBATH MUST HAVE FELT IT WAS ALL RIGHT 
IT TURNED OUT IT WAS A DISASTROUS REBELLION 
SO HE WENT BACK TO THE RECORD 
AND BLOTTED OUT THE WORD CAMP EACH TIME IT OCCURS 
IN AN ATTEMPT TO COVER HIS TRACKS 
FORTUNATELY TIME HAS FADED THE INK 
AND IT'S POSSIBLE TO READ WHAT'S UNDERNEATH NOW 
BY THE END OF EDWARD'S REIGN 
IT LOOKS AS IF THE PRIEST HAS ACCEPTED THE INEVITABLE 
AND THE ACCOUNTS THAT YEAR BEGIN 
BY RECITING THE KING'S TITLE INCLUDING 
SUPREME HEAD IN EARTH OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND 
HE'S SURRENDERED 
IT'S A CRUEL IRONY BECAUSE WITHIN A COUPLE OF MONTHS 
THE KING WAS DEAD AND TO SIR CHRISTOPHER'S IMMENSE DELIGHT 
THERE WAS A CATHOLIC QUEEN QUEEN MARY ON THE THRONE 
AND IMMEDIATELY EVERYBODY KNEW THAT THIS WOULD INVOLVE 
THE RECONSTRUCTION OF CATHOLICISM 
AND HE PUT DOWN ON PAPER FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT HE REALLY FELT 
ABOUT EDWARD WHAT HE REALLY FELT ABOUT MARY 
IN ALL THESE MEN'S TIME THE WHICH WAS IN THE TIME OF KING EDWARD THE SIXTH 
THE CHURCH EVER DECAYED AND THEN DIED THE KING 
AND QUEEN MARY'S GRACE DID SUCCEED 
AND HOW THE CHURCH WAS COMFORTED AGAIN IN HER TIME 
AND WHAT GIFTS WERE GIVEN TO THE CHURCH 
NOW YE SHALL HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF 
HE'S ALLOWED HIMSELF IN THOSE WORDS 
TO PUT ON RECORD THAT EDWARD'S REIGN WAS A DISASTER 
NOW WAS HOW THE CHURCH WAS COMFORTED 
HE JUDGES ENGLAND'S HISTORY BY WHAT IT DOES TO MOREBATH 
FOR HIM TO HAVE DONE ALL THAT IS A SUPREME IRONY 
BECAUSE WITHIN A MATTER OF DAYS OF HIS WRITING THAT 
NEWS HAD COME TO MOREBATH THAT QUEEN MARY WAS DEAD 
THAT THE PRINCESS ELIZABETH ANNE BOLEYN'S DAUGHTER A PROTESTANT 
HAD ASCENDED THE THRONE 
AND THE WHOLE ROLLERCOASTER OF TUDOR REFORMATION WAS ON ITS NEXT ROLL 
ELIZABETH'S REIGN MEANT FOR MOREBATH 
A RE RUN OF EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED IN EDWARD'S REIGN 
THERE ARE NOW NO DEVOTIONAL ACTIVITIES 
THE WHOLE THING IS RADICALLY SIMPLIFIED 
AS THE RELIGIOUS ACTIVITY SETTLES DOWN IN A PROTESTANT PATTERN 
THE UNTHINKABLE ALTERNATIVE TO CONFORMITY FOR SIR CHRISTOPHER 
WAS TO LEAVE HIS VICARAGE AND THE PEOPLE HE HAD BAPTISED 
MARRIED AND BURIED FOR FORTY YEARS 
HE CONTINUES TO SERVE THE PARISH INTO HIS EIGHTIES 
HE DIED IN MAY ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR 
HE HAD BEEN THEIR PRIEST CATHOLIC AND PROTESTANT FOR FIFTY FOUR YEARS 
HE HAD BEEN THE SPIRIT OF MOREBATH THE CHRONICLER OF ITS DRAMATIC 
AND SOMETIMES TRAGIC SHARE IN THE RELIGIOUS REVOLUTIONS OF THAT TURBULENT AGE 
AND WHEN THE TIME CAME HE HAD EASED THEM 
INTO A SLOW AND SETTLED CONFORMITY TO A NEW ORDER OF THINGS 
PERHAPS MOREBATH KNEW THAT WITH SIR CHRISTOPHER TRYCHAY 
THEY HAD BURIED SOMETHING OF THEMSELVES
