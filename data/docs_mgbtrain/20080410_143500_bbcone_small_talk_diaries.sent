DO YOU EVER WONDER WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A BUG 
YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT 
THIS INCREDIBLE INVENTION TRANSLATES THE THOUGHTS OF SMALL CREATURES 
INTO LANGUAGE WE CAN UNDERSTAND 
WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY DEVICE WE HAD NO IDEA HUMANS WERE SO INTELLIGENT 
WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD IT'S LIFE BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT 
TIME TO MEET THE POLLINATORS YEAH COS WE ARE BLOOMIN' MARVELLOUS 
OH EXCUSE ME YOU CAUGHT ME HAVING LUNCH 
THERE'S NOTHING A ROSE CHAFER BEETLE LIKES MORE THAN A POLLEN SALAD 
I LOVE POLLEN I KNOW IT JUST LOOKS LIKE TINY GRAINS OF DUST 
BUT IT'S FULL OF PROTEIN AND EVERY FLOWER HAS IT 
MIND YOU YOU NEED TOUGH JAWS LIKE MINE TO CRACK IT OPEN 
MOST CAN'T MANAGE IT BURP 
OH EXCUSE MY MANNERS I'M A BIT OF A MESSY EATER 
I'VE GOT POLLEN ALL OVER ME WHICH RUBS OFF ON THE NEXT PLANT I VISIT 
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED TO MAKE SEEDS 
THAT'LL BE POLLINATION WHICH MAKES US BEETLES VERY IMPORTANT 
OOH OOH OW COR I THINK I'VE OVEREATEN 
OOH TYPICAL ROSE CHAFER GET OVER YOURSELF WILL YOU 
WE'RE ALL IMPORTANT EXCEPT SOME OF US HAVE TO WORK HARDER THAN OTHERS 
WHILE HE'S DOSSING ABOUT IN THE SUN ALL DAY 
MUGGINS HERE HAS TO REAR A FAMILY OF FIFTY 
FILL ME BASKETS WITH POLLEN AND TOP UP ON NECTAR YOU KNOW NECTAR 
OH ALL RIGHT I'LL TELL YOU BUT I'VE ONLY GOT A MOMENT 
I'M LITERALLY AS BUSY AS A BEE 
I CAN'T SPEND ALL DAY TAKING POLLEN FROM FLOWER TO FLOWER FOR NOTHING 
THE PLANTS HAVE COME UP WITH A SWEETENER CALLED NECTAR 
IT'S JUST SUGAR AND WATER REALLY 
IT'S SO DELICIOUS 
IMAGINE IF LEMONADE GREW IN TREES 
WELL THERE YOU ARE THAT'S NECTAR 
NECTAR DOESN'T JUST TASTE NICE IT'S USEFUL TOO 
AND US HOVERFLIES CAN'T GET ENOUGH YES I'M A HOVERFLY 
I HOVER AND I'M A FLY 
THING IS I NEED LOTS OF FUEL TO KEEP ME IN THE AIR 
THAT'S WHAT NECTAR IS IT'S LIKE PETROL FOR INSECTS 
HOVERING IS ABOUT THE MOST TIRING THING ANYONE CAN DO 
THAT WHY ALL IS FLYING INSECTS NEED SO MUCH NECTAR 
WE NEED NECTAR SO WE CAN FLY AND WE HAVE TO FLY TO GET NECTAR 
THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO FLY TO GET NECTAR THAT WE NEED TO FLY TO 
GET THE NECTAR TO FLY THAT'S THE DEAL 
WE GET THE NECTAR AND IN RETURN WE GET COVERED IN POLLEN 
THESE PEARS ONLY EXIST COS THREE MONTHS AGO 
AN INSECT ARRIVED ON THIS TREE'S FLOWERS WITH THE POLLEN 
OF ANOTHER OF ANOTHER PEAR TREE IT COULD HAVE BEEN A BLUE BOTTLE 
WE'RE POLLINATORS TOO MAYBE MY GREAT GREAT GRANDDAD 
OR MY GREAT GREAT GREAT GRANDDAD FLIES DON'T LIVE LONG 
SO THREE MONTHS IS GOING BACK A BIT DON'T HE LOOK HAPPY 
LITTLE DID HE KNOW HE'D BE MAULED TO DEATH BY A NASTY HORNET 
NO OFFENCE NONE TAKEN 
LOOK I CAN'T STOP I'M STOCKING UP ON POLLEN FOR THE KIDS' TEA 
I CAN NEVER GET QUITE ENOUGH POLLEN IN MY BASKET 
YEAH THAT'S THEM ON THE BACK OF ME LEGS 
BIT MORE NECTAR AND I'M OFF HOME 
DOING THIS TEN TIMES A DAY I WISH I COULD FIND A FLOWER 
THAT DID A HOME DELIVERY SERVICE 
YOU KNOW IT IS HI HONEY I'M HOME BASKET'S BRIMMING 
HI HONEY 
HI HONEY HOW WAS YOUR DAY 
JUST A SEC I'M OFFLOADING MY POLLEN SACS OH THAT'S BETTER 
HOW ARE YOU CHUCK FINE PUT YOUR NECTAR IN THE HONEY POTS 
BAD DAY YOU KNOW COLLECTING NECTAR POLLINATING FLOWERS 
MAKING HONEY HELPING BUILD THE NEST YOU I HAD THE DAY OFF 
REALLY NO OF COURSE NOT I'M A BEE 
I TOLD YOU WE WERE BUSY 
ALL BEES DO PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING 
I BET THOSE HONEY BEES WILL SAY THEY'RE THE BEST AT MAKING HONEY 
WELL IF BUMBLE BEES WERE GOOD AT MAKING HONEY 
THEY'D BE CALLED HONEY BEES WOULDN'T THEY THEY'RE NOT WE ARE 
THEY HARDLY MAKE ANY WE MAKE LOADS 
THIS IS WHAT I CALL A HONEY PRODUCTION LINE 
THIS IS WHERE WE WORKER BEES MAKE HONEY 
BY THROWING UP THE NECTAR WE COLLECTED AND MIXING IT WITH SALIVA 
BET YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THIS ON YOUR TOAST 
WE NEED LOTS OF IT COS THERE'S THOUSANDS OF BABIES ONE PER CELL 
WHO HASN'T HAD ANY ME ME 
WE HAVE TO BE JUST AS ORGANISED OUTSIDE THE NEST AS WE ARE IN IT 
NO USE USING YOUR ENERGY FLYING AROUND AIMLESSLY LIKE A BUMBLE BEE 
LOOKING FOR A FLOWER WHEN SOMEONE'S ALREADY FOUND ONE 
WE'VE GOT A SYSTEM OF TELLING EACH OTHER WHERE THE BEST FLOWERS ARE 
THE WAGGLE DANCE 
YES YOU HEARD RIGHT THE WAGGLE DANCE 
NOW THE BEE IN THE MIDDLE TELLS US WHICH WAY TO FLY 
HOW LONG FOR AND HOW MUCH GOOD STUFF IS THERE JUST BY DANCING 
IT'S A BIT LIKE CHARADES 
RIGHT SO RIGHT OUT OF THE NEST IS IT 
RIGHT RIGHT OUT THE NEST YEAH LEFT AT DANDELION NO RIGHT 
O. K. PAST THE SCARECROW 
FLY ACROSS ONE NO TWO FIELDS THREE FIELDS 
RIGHT AFTER THREE FIELDS RIGHT OUT OF THE NEST RIGHT AT THE DANDELION 
PAST THE SCARECROW ACROSS THE FIELDS OVER THE FENCE NO 
THROUGH THE FENCE YES LET'S GO 
OH NO SHE SAID RIGHT AT THE DANDELION 
OH YOU COULD HAVE CHOSEN A CLOSER MEADOW BERYL 
WHEE 
YOU KNOW IN THE TIME IT TAKES THE HONEY BEES TO DO THEIR DANCE 
US BUMBLE BEES HAVE ALREADY FOUND THREE FLOWERS 
SO CALLED HONEY BEES THEIR HONEY'S NO BETTER THAN OURS 
THEY DON'T POLLINATE ANY MORE THAN US OR OTHER INSECTS 
BECAUSE THERE'S ALL SORTS INVOLVED IN POLLINATING 
YOU'RE RIGHT WHAT ABOUT US BUTTERFLIES 
NOT ONLY ARE WE POLLINATORS WE LOOK BEAUTIFUL DOING IT 
ESPECIALLY US MARBLE WHITES WE ARE STUNNING 
THERE'S ALWAYS SOME OTHER BUTTERFLY WANTS YOUR FLOWER 
WE HAVE RULES ONLY ONE BUTTERFLY ALLOWED ON A FLOWER AT A TIME 
BUT THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE WHO THINKS THEY OWN THE PLACE 
RIGHT PRIMA DONNAS NO CLASS 
I'M ON THIS ONE YEAH 
I DIDN'T REALISE YOU OWNED THE FLOWERS WANNA MAKE SOMETHING OF IT 
IF YOU WANT POLLINATION DONE PROPERLY THEN LOOK NO FURTHER 
MY TONGUE GETS THE NECTAR AND WHILE I'M ON IT I PICK UP THE POLLEN 
AND I LOOK STUNNING DOING IT BETTER THAN THOSE WANNABES 
WHO ARE YOU CALLING A WANNABE 
I DON'T SEE ANY OTHERS HERE SO IT MUST BE YOU 
YOU WANNA MAKE SOMETHING OF IT I AM 
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING MADE OF IT TOO LATE 
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU MADE SOMETHING OF IT JUST GET OFF OF MY FLOWER 
OH LOSER 
NO CLASS THAT BUTTERFLY NO CLASS 
THAT LOOK IS SO LAST YEAR 
OH THOSE BUTTERFLIES SO MOUTHY 
THEY'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING OVER WHO LOOKS BEST 
IT DOESN'T MATTER TO THE FLOWERS WHAT WE LOOK LIKE 
BUT IT DOES MATTER TO US WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE 
US INSECTS ARE SUCKERS FOR A GOOD LOOKING FLOWER 
YELLOW PURPLE RED WHITE THEY ACT AS AN ADVERT 
DEPENDING ON WHAT INSECT YOU ARE 
YOU KNOW THEY MIGHT BE SAYING ROLL UP LOADS OF NECTAR AND POLLEN HERE 
EASY ACCESS OPEN ALL HOURS 
OR THEY MIGHT BE SAYING DON'T BOTHER UNLESS YOU'RE SMALL 
AND HAVE A VERY LONG TONGUE SPECIALISTS ONLY 
NO TIME WASTERS 
SEE THIS ONE FITS ME LIKE A GLOVE 
IT'S CALLED A FOXGLOVE BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN A FOX WEARING ONE 
NO IT'S SPECIALLY FOR BUMBLE BEES 
HE'S GOT NO CHANCE WRONG SHAPE AND SIZE 
AND THAT'S BEFORE HE FINDS OUT HIS TONGUE'S NOT LONG ENOUGH 
THESE MARKINGS SHOW ME THE WAY TO THE NECTAR AND THE POLLEN 
NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL A NATURE TRAIL 
US INSECTS POPULATING THE WORLD WITH PLANTS AND FLOWERS 
JUST BY LOOKING FOR FOOD IT'S PERFECT 
WELL ALMOST 
COS THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY WHO'S GOT TO RUIN IT FOR THE OTHERS 
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ME 
WITH ALL THIS BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS SOMEONE HAS TO BE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR ACTS OF EXTREME VIOLENCE JUST FOR BALANCE 
STEP FORWARD THE CRAB SPIDER HELLO 
AND THE FUN BIT IS WE GET TO DRESS UP AS FLOWERS 
TODAY I'M GOING TO BE A DAISY DOES MY BUM LOOKS BIG IN YELLOW 
OOH LOOK A LOVELY DAISY 
O. I. O. I. HERE'S LUNCH 
OH OOH IF I COULD JUST GET MY STING INTO YOU YOU'LL BE SORRY 
OH THERE'S NO NEED TO BE LIKE THAT HOW ABOUT A SEDATIVE 
TO QUIETEN YOURSELF DOWN 
IT'LL BE EASIER FOR US ALL IF YOU DIDN'T STRUGGLE SO MUCH 
I'LL NEVER GIVE IN IT'LL TAKE MORE THAN YOUR SEDATIVE 
TO KNOCK ME AH 
AH 
AHA YOU SEE I ZE HUMMING BIRD DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT CRAB SPIDERS 
THE TRICK IS TO GET ZE NECTAR WITHOUT LANDING ON THE FLOWER 
IT'S EASY 
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOVER IN MID AIR AND GROW A LONG TUBE 
THE LENGTH OF YOUR BODY ON THE FRONT OF YOUR MOUTH 
WHAT COULD BE SIMPLER NO DANGER 
O. K. IT'S TECHNICALLY CHEATING BUT AT LEAST I DON'T DAMAGE THE FLOWERS 
HONESTLY YOU SHOULD SEE THOSE BEETLES 
COME ON BE FAIR 
WHEN YOU SEE A FLOWER LIKE THIS DON'T YOU WANT GET IN THERE 
COME HERE OH LOVELY IT IS LOVELY H. M. M. LOVELY 
TASTES DELICIOUS BEAUTIFUL 
I KNOW IT LOOKS LIKE WE DON'T CARE BASHING FLOWERS TO PIECES 
TRYING TO GET THE POLLEN BUT WE'RE ENTITLED 
US BEETLES HAVE BEEN POLLINATING FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS 
BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE SO WE'RE A BIT STUCK IN OUR WAYS 
I KNOW IT LOOKS LIKE THE BEETLE'S EATING THE FLOWER 
BUT ACTUALLY HE'S WELL HE'S ALL RIGHT HE IS EATING IT 
BUT IT'S HUNGRY WORK POLLINATION 
THE PLANTS DON'T MIND AS LONG AS WE CARRY THEIR POLLEN TO THE NEXT PLANT 
I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYONE COMPLAIN ANYWAY 
YOU SEE THAT'S THE THING ISN'T IT 
THE FLOWERS WON'T COMPLAIN COS THEY'RE GETTING WHAT THEY WANT 
POLLINATED AND WE GET WHAT WE WANT FED 
AND ALTHOUGH THE FLOWERS DO GET BASHED ABOUT A BIT 
DON'T FEEL TOO SORRY FOR THEM THEY OFTEN HAVE THE LAST LAUGH 
HAVE I GOT SOMETHING ON MY FACE HAVE I YOU WOULD SAY IF I DID 
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING ON YOUR FACE STAN OH I KNEW I HAD 
COR I'LL TELL YOU HOW THIS HAS HAPPENED 
THERE I WAS HAPPILY FLYING ABOUT LOOKING FOR SOME NECTAR 
WHEN I SAW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS ANOTHER BEE 
A RATHER ATTRACTIVE FEMALE 
NATURALLY I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT FANCY SOME COMPANY SO I STOPPED FOR A CHAT 
IT'S ONLY AFTER A FEW SECONDS THAT I THINK HANG ON 
THIS IS NO FEMALE BEE IT'S AN ORCHID THAT HAS FLOWERS 
THAT LOOK LIKE FEMALE BEES OH WHAT A CLOWN 
I HAD A FAST ONE PULLED ON ME BY A FLOWER 
PROPER CHARLIE I FELT 
AND TO TOP IT ALL I GOT POLLEN ALL OVER ME FACE 
MY HUMILIATION IS COMPLETE WHO IS USING WHO HERE 
GIVE US A HAND GETTING IT OFF ALBERT NO

BAD LUCK YOU'LL HAVE TO GO AND FIND ANOTHER ORCHID
