EXTRAORDINARY TWIST IN THE 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE 
DISAPPEARANCE OF SHANNON MATTHEWS 
LAST NIGHT POLICE ARRESTED HER THIRTY TWO 
YEAR OLD MOTHER ON SUSPICION OF 
ATTEMPTING TO PERVERT THE COURSE OF 
JUSTICE ONE THEORY IS WHEN SHANNON 
SHANNON DISAPPEARED MS. MATTHEWS MAY 
HAVE KNOWN MORE ABOUT THE 
DISAPPEARANCE THAN SHE TOLD POLICE 
MARK SIMPSON IS IN DEWSBURY 
THIS IS A FAST MOVING CASE L. 
REMEMBER THE NIGHT AFTER SHANNON 
DISAPPEARED WE THE B. B. C. WERE 
FILMING HERE OUTSIDE THE FAMILY 
AND UNPROMPTED SHANNON'S 
MOTHER CAME DOWN AND STOOD BESIDE 
ME AND SAID I WANT TO DO AN 
INTERVIEW AND MADE THE FIRST OF 
MANY PUBLIC APPEALS FOR HER 
DAUGHTER TO COME HOME A LOT LOT 
HAPPENED IN SEVEN WEEKS NOT LEAST 
THE NEWS LAST NIGHT THAT KAREN 
MATTHEWS HAS HERSELF BEEN ARRESTED 
THROUGHOUT HER DAUGHTER'S 
DISAPPEARANCE KAREN MATTHEWS 
APPEALED FOR HELP IN TRYING TO FIND 
HER HER SHE WORE THE SAME T. SHIRT EVERY DAY 
AND ALONG WITH HER PARTNER CRAIG 
MEEHAN SHE WAS BACKED BY THE LOCAL 
COMMUNITY DURING THE TWENTY FOUR DAYS AND TWENTY FOUR 
NIGHTS THAT SHANNON WAS MISSING 
THE DAY AFTER THE SCHOOLGIRL 
DISAPPEARED KAREN MATTHEWS MADE 
THE FIRST OF MANY PUBLIC APPEALS 
WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH 
PLEASE COME HOME SHANNON 
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING 
AT ALL FROM HER

IT WAS THE BIGGEST SEARCH OPERATION 
IN WEST YORKSHIRE IN RECENT HISTORY 
EVEN AFTER SHANNON WAS FOUND THAT 
INVESTIGATION CONTINUED LAST NIGHT 
SHAN SHANNON'S MUM WAS ARRESTED 
POLICE ARE QUESTIONING HER ON 
SUSPICION OF ATTEMPTING TO PERVERT 
THE COURSE OF JUSTICE 
IT WAS THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT IN A 
FAST MOVING CASE 
SHANNON WENT MISSING SEVEN WEEKS 
AGO SHE WAS FOUND ALIVE AND WELL 
IN A HOUSE JUST OVER MILE FROM 
HER HOME 
THREE DAYS LATER HER STEPFATHER'S 
UNCLE MICHAEL DONOVAN WAS CHARGED 
WITH KIDNAPPING SHANNON AT THE 
WEEKEND HE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE SLIT 
HIS WRISTS LAST WEEK IN AN 
UNRELATED FATHER HER STEP DAD 
CRAIG MEEHAN WAS CHARGED WITH 
POSSESSING INDECENT IMAGES ON 
FRIDAY HIS MOTHER AND SISTER WERE

SHANNON'S DIAPPEARANCE THEY WERE 
RELEASED RELEASED LAST NIGHT SHANNON'S MOTHER WAS 
ARRESTED ARRESTED NEIGHBOURS HAVE BEEN LEFT CONFUSED 
AND AND WONDERING WHERE IT IS GOING 
TO END 
I HAVE HEARD PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT 
IT ON BUSES AND IN SHOPS AND IT IS 
JUST UNBELIEVABLE RLG 
REALLY 
THREE WEEKS AFTER SHE WAS FOUND 
QUESTIONS ARE STILL BEING ASKED 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO NINE YEAR 
OLD SHANNON MATTHEWS 
A LOT OF SPECULATION STILL 
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT THOUGH 
THERE ARE TWO KEY QUESTIONS WHO 
KNEW WHAT AND EXACTLY WHEN DID THEY 
KNOW IT THAT'S WHAT THE FRIENDS 
NEIGHBOURS ARE ASKING HERE TODAY IN 
DEWSBURY AND I DARE SAY IT IS ALSO 
WHAT THE POLICE ARE ASKING KAREN 
MATTHEWS SHANNON'S MUM AS WE SPEAK 
THE POLICE HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE 
TONIGHT THEY ARE GOING TO QUESTION 
KAREN MATTHEWS THIS AFTERNOON AND 
TONIGHT THEY HAVE TO DECIDE 
WHETHER TO CHARGE HER TO RELEASE 
HER WITHOUT CHARGE OR APPLY FOR 
EXTRA TIME TO CONTINUE TO QUESTION 
HER HER MARK THANK YOU 
PROTESTERS DISRUPTED THE PASSAGE OF 
THE OLYMPIC TORCH THROUGH PARIS 
THOUSANDS OF POLICE WERE ON THE 
STREETS OF THE CITY TO STOP A 
REPEAT OF THE SCENES SEEN YESTERDAY 
HERE IN LONDON BUT FACED WITH 
DEMONSTRATORS THEY HAD TO PUT THE 
FLAME OUT TWICE AND HAD TO PUT IT 
ON A BUS KATHERINE CARPENTER 
REPORTS REPORTS SCENES NOW FAMILIAR WHEREVER THE 
TORCH GOES TODAY IT IS PROTESTERS 
IN PARIS MAKING THEIR VOICES HEARD 
AGAIN IN CLASHES WITH POLICE THIS 
IS ANOTHER HIGH SECURITY OPERATION 
BUT WHEREAS OFFICERS IN LONDON 
FOLLOWED THE FLAME ON BIKES THEIR 
COUNTERPARTS ARE FAVOURING ROLLER 
SKATES SKATES THE FRENCH ARE DETERMINED NOT TO 
SEE REPEAT OF YESTERDAY'S EVENTS 
IN LONDON ONE CAMPAIGNER TRIED TO 
GRAB THE TORCH FROM FORMER BLUE 
PETER PRESENTER CONNY HUCK 
SECURITY ALMOST OBSCURED THE TORCH 
BEARERS AS THE POLICE WERE FORCED 
TO CALL IN REINFORCEMENTS CLAIMS 
SOME OFFICERS WERE TOO HEAVY HAND 
INDEED THEIR TREATMENT OF 
PROTESTERS WERE DENIED BY THE THE 
MAN IN CHARGE OF POLICING THE RELAY 
YESTERDAY YESTERDAY THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS MADE THEIR 
POINT THEY DID WHAT PROTESTERS 
SHOULD DO THE EVENT WAS SPOILED BY 
A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DID 
THEIR BEST TO STEAL THE TORCH AND 
ATTACK TORCH BEARERS THEY WERE 
DEALT W. 
THE PROTESTS EMBARRASSED OLYMPIC 
OFFICIALS THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE 
CALLED FOR A RAPID PEACEFUL 
RESOLUTION IN TIBET ON CAMERA HE 
WAS MORE MEASURED 
SO WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT HAPPY WITH 
THE PROTEST WE RESPECT THE PROTEST 
THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT AS 
LONG AS THEY ARE NOT VIOLENT 
THE PROTESTS IN LONDON MADE 
HEADLINES IN CHINA THIS MORNING 
HERE IT WAS REPORTED IN A VERY 
DIFFERENT WAY 
LET'S GET THE LATEST FROM DOMINIC 
HUGHES WHO IS IN PARIS AND HAS BEEN 
WATCHING THE DEMONSTRATION 
REALLY ONE HAS TO WONDER HOW LONG 
THIS RELAY CAN CONTINUE GIVEN WHAT 
WE HAVE SEEN YESTERDAY AND INDEED 
TODAY TODAY YES CHAOTIC SCENES TODAY WITH THE 
TORCH HAVING TO RETURN TO THE BUS 
THAT ACCOMPANIES IT NOT ONCE BUT 
TWICE BECAUSE PROTESTERS GOT SO 
CLOSE TO IT IN THE FIRST HOUR OF 
THE TORCH RELAY IT ONLY MANAGE 
TODAY COVER TWO KILOMETRES ON A TWENTY EIGHT 
KILOMETRE ROUTE ROUTE SUCH WAS THE 
DISRUPTION A HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE 
THREE THOUSAND OFFICERS ON THE STREET BUT 
NOT ENOUGH TO STOP PROTESTERS 
GETTING NEAR THE TORCH 
EMBARRASSING FOR THE AUTHORITIES 
HERE AND IN CHINA AGAIN HEAVY 
POLICE PRESENCE AND PERHAPS THERE 
WILL BE MORE QUESTIONS OVER POLICE 
TACTICS TACTICS YES IT IS AN UTTER PUBLIC 
RELATIONS DISASTER FOR THE CHINESE 
AUTHORITIES AND THE CHINESE 
ORGANISING COMMITTEE OF THE OLYMPIC 
GAMES WHO HOPED THIS COULD BE A 
CELEBRATION OF THE OLYMPIC SPIRIT 
THE TORCH RELAYS DON'T MEAN MUCH 
IT IS A CHANCE FOR THE PEOPLE TO 
SHARE IN THE OLYMPIC SPIRIT BUT IT 
HAS BECOME A HUGE FOCUS FOR 
PROTESTS OVER WHAT'S GOING ON IN 
TIBET P. 
THANK YOU 
GORDON BROWN'S LATEST TAX CHANGES 
CAME INTO EFFECT OVER THE WEEKEND 
AMONG THEM THE ABOLITION OF THE TEN 
PENCE STARTING RATE FOR INCOME TAX 
IT HAS BEEN CRITICISED BY A GROUP 
OF OF M. P.'S WHO SAY THE MOVE WHICH 
WILL SEE PEOPLE PAYING MORE TAX 
WILL HIT LOW PAID WORKERS HARDEST 
HERE IS HUGH PYM 
TAX CUTS THE HEADLINES AFTER 
BUDGET TWO THOUSAND SEVEN GORDON BROWN'S LAST 
AND THE TWOPENNY CUT IN THE BASIC 
RATE OF INCOME TAX GENERATED CHEERS 
ON THE LABOUR BENCHES IN THE 
COMMONS COMMONS I WILL FROM NEXT APRIL CUT THE 
BASIC RATE OF INCOME TAX FROM TWENTY TWO 
PENCE TO TWENTY PENCE 
BUT MANY M. P.'S DIDN'T SPOT THE STING 
IN THE TAIL THE ABOLITION OF THE 
LOWER TEN PENCE RATE THEY HAVE NOW 
AS IT TAKES EFFECT THIS WEEK 
HITTING THE PAY PACKETS OF MILLIONS 
OF LOWER PAID WORKERS 
THE LABOUR PARTY IS IN BUSINESS IF 
IT IS IN BUSINESS FOR ANYTHING IS 
TO PROTECT THE POOREST IN OUR 
COMMUNITY COMMUNITY AND AS A RESULT OF SIMPIFYING THE 
TAX SYSTEM WHICH I THINK MOST 
PEOPLE SUPPORT WE NOW FIND 
OURSELVES IN A POSITION OF MAKING 
THE LOWEST PAID WORSE OFF 
WHO LOSES FROM THE CHANGES 
TOM AGED TWENTY FOUR IS A TRAINEE AND HIS 
WIFE WORKS PART TIME THEIR JOINT 
ANNUAL SALARY IS SEVENTEEN THOUSAND THEY HAVE 
NO CHILDREN 
THEY WILL BE SIXTY SEVEN A YEAR WORSE OFF 
ANOTHER LOSER ISAN THAT ANNA 
SHE IS LE SIX WORSE OFF EIGHTY SIX WORSE 
OFF OFF BUT A WINNER IS WALTER 
PROFESSIONAL ON A FIFTY THOUSAND SALARY 
HE WILL BE TWO HUNDRED NINETY ONE A YEAR BETTER OFF 
THANKS TO THE CUT IN THE BASIC RATE 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL 
HOUSEHOLD CHANGES GORDON BROWN WAS 
ACTUALLY GIVING AWAY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING SOME 
ON BELOW AVERAGE INCOMES WILL BE 
BETTER OFF BUT WITH TAX CHANGES 
YOU TEND TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE 
LOSERS THAN THE WINNERS 
NOW THERE IS A WARNING FROM AN 
INFLUENTIAL COMMONS COMMITTEE TO 
THE GOVERNMENT IDENTIFY THE 
TAXPAYERS WHO WILL SUFFER AND DO 
SOMETHING TO HELP THEM 
CAROLE WALKER IS OUTSIDE THE HOUSE 
OF COMMONS 
HUGH SAYING THAT M. P.'S ARE ANGRY AT 
WHAT THEY SEE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
GOING TO LOSE OUT 
M. P.'S ANGRY AT WHAT THEY FEEL TARGET 
THE LOW PAID AND ALIENATE CORE 
LABOUR VOTERS 
THAT'S RIGHT YOU 
HAVE GOT A LOT OF M. P.'S WHO HAVE 
CONSTITUENTS COMING UP TO THEM 
SAYING WHY IS A LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
HITTING SOME OF THE LOWEST PAID 
WORKERS PARTICULARLY AT A TIME 
WHEN IT IS TRYING TO ENSURE THAT 
WORK PAYS AND PEOPLE DON'T STAY ON 
BENEFIT FRANK FIELD CONCERNED 
ABOUT THAT HE IS GOING TO TRY TO 
FORCE A VOTE TO ENSURE THAT THERE 
ARE SOME COMPENSATION FOR THESE 
PEOPLE NOW AT THE MOMENT THE 
GOVERNMENT IS SAYING THAT THERE IS 
NO QUESTION OF A RE THINK ON THIS 
IT IS A PART OF THE BUDGET WHICH 
INCLUDESED THE CUT IN THE BASIC 
RATE BUT DAVID CAMERON THE 
CONSERVATIVE LEADER IS MAKING THE 
MOST OF LABOUR'S PROBLEMS ON THIS 
HE IS SAYING THE TORIES NOW WILL 
TRY TO OVERTURN THIS HE IS CALLING 
ON M. P.'S AT ALL PARTIES TO SUPPORT 
HIM I THINK THERE IS A HEAD OF 
STEAM BUILDING UP ON THIS NOW IT 
COMES AT A BAD TIME FOR GORDON 
BROWN WHEN PEOPLE ARE SAYING HE IS 
FAILING TO GET LABOUR'S CORE 
MESSAGE ACROSS AND AS THINGS STAND 
HE COULD BE FACING A REBELLION 
THANK YOU 
H. S. B. C. ADMITTED LOSING THE DETAILS OF 
THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS A DISC

TEAMS OF THOUSANDS OF OFFICERS 
VERY VERY SIMILAR TO RUNNING CITY 
HALL HALL ZIMBABWE'S OPPOSITION LEADER E. 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI IS HOLDING MEET 
NTION SOUTH AFRICA WHILE HIS PARTY

MANOEUVRINGS GO ON TODAY WE WE A 
FIRST DECISION FROM THE HIGH COURT 
IN HARARE THAT IT HAS THE 
JURISDICTION TO DECIDE ON THIS 
ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT THE 
ELECTION RESULTS SHOULD BE RELEASED 
HOWEVER TO THE SURPRISE OF MANY 
IT DECIDED THAT IT WOULDN'T CARRY 
ON WITH THE CASE UNTIL TOMORROW AND 
TOMORROW IT WILL THEN DECIDE IF IT 
SHOULD HEAR THE CASE AS A MATTER OF 
URGENCY I THINK MANY WILL FEEL 
WHAT COULD BE MORE PRESSING AT THIS 
TIME IT IS NOW TEN DAYS SINCE THE 
ELECTION TOOK PLACE AND IT WILL BE 
TEN DAYS TOMORROW SINCE THE 
ELECTION TOOK PLACE INSIDE ZIMBABWE 
AND STILL NO RESULT NOW THE 
OPPOSITION WOULD SEE THIS COURT 
VERDICT AS ANOTHER INDICATION OF 
THE REGIME DRAGGING ITS FEET 
DRYING ALL IT CAN TO BUY TIME TO 
WORK OUT ITS NEXT MOVES AS YOU SAY 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI IS HERE IN SOUTH 
AFRICA TODAY HAVING MEETINGS WE 
HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD WITH WHOM 
HE HAS WRITTEN A POWERFUL EDITORIAL 
IN THE GUARDIAN CALLING ON MAJOR 
POWERS TO ACT DECISIVELY AND THROW 
ROBERT MUGABE OUT OF OFFICE 
THERE HAS BEEN CONCERNS THAT SOME 
WHITE FARMS HAD BEEN SURROUNDED 
GIVEN SOME OF THE STATEMENTS THAT 
MR. MUGABE HAS BEEN MAKING ANYMORE 
ON THAT 
THAT'S RIGHT WE ARE 
SEEING SIGNS NOW OF THE SO CALLED 
WAR VETERANS BEING REACTTIVEVATED 
THEY POPPED UP LAST FRIDAY HOLDING 
A PROTESTON THE STREETS PEACEFUL 
IN THAT CASE OVER THE WEEKEND THEY 
MOVED ON TO ABOUT EIGHT FARMS OR 
TRIED TO REOCCUPY EIGHT FARMS THAT 
ARE STILL IN WHITE HANDS THEY WERE 
REMOVED BY THE AUTHORITIES BUT 
SOME OF THE FARMERS ARE STILL TOO 
AFRAID TO GO BACK AND EVERYBODY 
REMEMBERS WHAT THE WAR VETERANS 
HAVE DONE IN ZIMBABWE IN THE PAST 
THEY WERE A A TOOL OF THE REGIME IN 
TWO THOUSAND THERE WAS VIOLENCE AND 
INTIMIDATION ASSOCIATED WORTHWHILE 
THEIR CAMPAIGN TO GET RID OF THE 
WHITE FARMERS NOW WE ARE SEEING 
THEM GEARING UP AGAIN AND PRESIDENT 
MUG GEE SAID THAT PRESIDENT 
MUGABE SAID THAT ZIMBABWEANS HAVE 
TO REDEFEND THEIR LAND 
THANK YOU 
THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE 
DISAPPEARANCE OF MADELEINE MCCANN 
MOVES TO THE U. K. TODAY PORTUGUESE 
DETECTIVES HAVE ARRIVED IN 
LEICESTERSHIRE TO HEAR FROM SEVEN 
FRIENDS WHO WERE WITH MADELEINE'S 
PARENTS WHEN SHE DISAPPEARED 
ROBERT HALL IS AT EAST MIDLANDS 
AIRPORT AIRPORT THE TEAM LANDED HERE FROM PORTUGAL 
JUST AFTER MIDDAY OH THEY HAD 
ASKED FOR A LOW KEY VISIT AND 
LEICESTERSHIRE POLICE ARE HELPING 
THEM WITH THAT THE TEAM IS LED BY 
THE SENIOR INVESTIGATING OFFICER A 
POINTED TOWARDS THE END OF LAST 
YEAR AFTER HIS PREDECESSOR WAS 
SACKED FROM THIS PRIORY HE AND HIS 
COLLEAGUES WILL BE SITTING IN ON 
INTERVIEWS THIS INQUIRY THERE 
THEY WILL BE LOOKING FOR ANY 
INCONSISTENCIES IN VERBAL EVIDENCE 
GIVEN BY THE SEVEN WITNESSES OR 
POSSIBLE INCONSISTENCIES IN THE 
TIMELINE THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AT 
THAT RESORT IN MAY OF LAST YEAR 
ELEVEN MONTHS AFTER MADELEINE MCCANN'S 
DISAPPEARANCE THE SEVEN FRIENDS 
WHO OFFERED SUPPORT IN THOSE EARLY 
DAYS REMAIN CENTRAL TO THE 
PORTUGUESE POLICE INQUIRY ALL WERE 
AT DINNER WITH KATE AND GERRY 
MCCANN APPETITE AS PART ALONGSIDE 
PAUL SOME LIKE THE MCCANNS LEFT 
THE TABLE PERIODICALLY TO CHECK ON 
THEIR FAMILIES ONE MEMBER OF THE 
GROUP SPOKE TO THE B. B. C. LAST YEAR 
SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO SET THE RECORD 
STRAIGHT 
I BELIEVE MADELEINE WAS STRAIGHT ABDUCTED IF PEOPLE ARE NOT TAKING 
THAT SERIOUSLY PEOPLE COULD BE OUT 
THERE HAVING EVIDENCE AND THEY 
MIGHT THINK THEY WILL NOT GIVE IT 
BECAUSE SHE WASN'T ABDUCTED AND 
THAT IS THE SCARIEST THING THAT 
PEOPLE WOULD NOT COME FORWARD 
BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY ARE LYING 
AND IT'S JUST RUBBISH 
THE KEY 
ELEMENT OF JANE HANNA'S EVIDENCE 
CONCERNS HER RECOLLECTION OF A MAN 
CARRYING A CHILD NEAR HER APARTMENT 
COMPLEX AT NINE FORTY FIVE P. M. THAT EVENING FORTY FIVE 
MINUTES BEFORE THE MCCANNS REALISED 
THEIR CHILD WAS MISSING SHE WAS 
HAPPY TO BE RE INTERVIEWED BY 
POLICE 
YES OF COURSE WE WOULD IF POLICE IT HELPS TO FIND MADELEINE WE 
WOULD BE INTERVIEWED TOMORROW THE THE PORTUGUESE INVESTIGATORS WHO WILL 
MOVE ON TO LEICESTERSHIRE POLICE 
HEADQUARTERS HAVE NOT ASKED FOR 
INTERVIEWS WITH MADELEINE'S PARENTS 
WHO WILL BE AWAY FROM THE COUNTY 
FOR MUCH OF THIS WEEK THEY HAVE 
PREPARED THEIR OWN LIST OF FIFTY 
WITNESSES TO SUPPORT THE CASE THAT 
THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR 
DAUGHTER'S DISAPPEARANCE 
BEFORE THEY LEFT LEICESTERSHIRE 
KATE AND GERRY MCCANN SAID THEY 
WERE MORE THAN HAPPY THAT THESE 
INTERVIEWS WERE BEING CARRIED OUT 
THEY ARE REMEMBER WITNESS 
INTERVIEWS OH THERE WILL BE NO 
LAWYERS PRESENT AND THOSE 
QUESTIONED CAN LEAVE AT ANY TIME 
IT IS A PROCESS THAT MAY LAST 
SEVERAL DAYS 
THE HEADLINES POLICE HAVE ARRESTED 
THE MOTHER OF SHANNON MASTER USED 
ON SUSPICION OF ATTEMPTING TO 
PERVERT THE COURSE OF JUSTICE 
SHAM AND MATTHEWS 
SCIENTISTS SAY THEY HAVE CREATED 
STEM CELLS WITHOUT THE USE OF HUMAN 
EMBRYOS EMBRYOS LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON LAGGING BEHIND 
IN THE POLLS WHAT CAN THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE PULL OUT OF THE 
BAG AS HE LAUNCHES HIS CAMPAIGN 
AND WHAT DOES LONDON'S BUSINESS 
COMMUNITY ONE FROM THE MAYOR 
WANT FROM 
AMERICAN SCIENTISTS HAVE MADE RAPID 
PROGRESS IN DEVELOPING A WAY OF 
CREATING STEM CELLS WITHOUT USING 
HUMAN EMBRYOS THEY ARE USING A NEW 
METHOD AND HAVE RUN AND HAVE 
DEVELOPED CELLS THAT ARE HELPING TO 
STUDY EIGHT DISEASES OPPONENTS OF 
EMBRYO STEM CELL RESEARCH HAVE 
WELCOMED THE ANNOUNCEMENT 
THESE ARE HYBRID HUMAN EMBRYOS 
THEY HAD BEEN CREATED FROM HUMAN 
D. N. A. AND EMPTY COW EGGS THEY CAN BE 
USED TO CREATE STEM CELLS FOR OR 
RESEARCH RECENTLY AN AMERICAN 
TEAM ANNOUNCED THEY HAD DEVELOPED 
AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD WHICH DOES 
NOT REQUIRE THE CREATION OF EMBRYOS 
TODAY ONE OF THE RESEARCHERS 
CONCERN SAID THAT HE HAD MADE RAPID 
PROGRESS HE HAS TAKEN SKIN CELLS 
FROM PATIENTS WITH A DIFFERENT 
DISEASES AND TURNED THEM DIRECTLY 
INTO STEM CELLS 
THE POTENTIAL IS 
INCREDIBLE TO UNDERSTAND THE 
EARLIEST STAGES OF HUMAN GENETIC 
DISEASE HOW IT IMPACTS THE 
FORMATION OF TISSUE LIKE BLOOD IT 
HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY RAPID BUT THE 
WORK HAS JUST BEGUN 
THE CREATION 
OF THE STEM CELLS WITHOUT THE USE 
OF EMBRYOS HAVE BEEN WELCOMED BY 
THE LEADER OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
IN SCOTLAND LAST MONTH CARDINAL 
KEITH O'BRIEN DESCRIBED THE 
CREATION OF HYBRID EMBRYOS AS 
FRANKENSTEIN RESEARCH 
AT THIS 
PRESENT TIME WHEN THERE ARE THESE 
ONGOING POSSIBILITIES OF HELPING 
RESEARCH WITHOUT INVOLVING HYBRIDS 
BETWEEN ANIMALS AND HUMAN BEING I 
THINK WE MUST TAKE EVERY 
OPPORTUNITY OF ADVANCING THAT 
RESEARCH WITHOUT GETTING INVOLVED 
IN THIS OTHER TYPE OF UNETHICAL 
RESEARCH 
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS RESEARCH BACKED CALLS BY THE SCIENTIFIC 
COMMUNITY TO ALLOW THEM TO CREATE 
HYBRID EMBRYOS FOR RESEARCH BUT HE 
IS ALLOWING M. P.'S A FREE VOTE ON NEW 
LEGISLATION ON THE ISSUE 
PARLIAMENT WILL BE VOTING ON THE 
EMBRYOLOGY BILL NEXT MONTH CRITICS 
SAY THAT THE RAPID PROGRESS MADE BY 
THE AMERICAN GROUP IS ONE MORE 
REASON TO OPPOSE CONTROVERSIAL 
RESEARCH OPPOSING THE USE OF 
EMBRYOS SCIENTISTS HOWEVER SAY 
THAT EMBRYO RESEARCH IS STILL 
ESSENTIAL TO FIND CURES FOR MANY 
KILLER DISEASES 
THE JURY IN THE AIRLINE BOMB TRIAL 
HAS BEEN HEARING ABOUT ONE OF THE 
ALLEGED LEADERS OF THE PLOT 
MOHAMED GULZAR WAS DESCRIBED BY THE 
PROSECUTION AS A SHADOWY FIGURE WHO 
ARRIVED IN THE U. K. UNDER A FALSE 
IDENTITY AND STAYED IN AN 
UNFINISHED HOUSE IN ALL EIGHT MEN 
ARE ACCUSED OF CONSPIRING TO COMMIT 
MURDER AND TO ENDANGER AN AIRCRAFT 
OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT IS 
AT WOOLWICH CROWN COURT WHAT OTHER 
COURT DETAILS HAVE BEEN HEARD 
TODAY 
SO FAR WE HAVE HEARD OF TODAY SEVEN MEN OR ARE LIVING IN BRITAIN 
SIX OF WHOM THE PROSECUTION SAY HAD 
RECORDED SUICIDE VIDEOS THE OTHER 
MAN WAS BEHOLD OF THE VIDEOS 
SUPPOSEDLY AND ALSO HAD EQUIPMENT 
FOR MANUFACTURING EXPLOSIVES AT HIS 
HOME THE HOPE OF THE VIDEOS 
MOHAMED GULZAR WAS DESCRIBED AS A 
SHADOWY FIGURE NOT A FOOT SOLDIER 
BUT RATHER A SENIOR FIGURE HE IS A 
BRITISH CITIZEN BUT HE HAD ARRIVED 
IN BRITAIN JUST A FEW WEEKS BEFORE 
THE ARRESTS UNDER A FALSE SOUTH 
AFRICAN IDENTITY AND UNDER A FALSE 
NAME WE WERE STAYING IN AN 
UNFINISHED HOUSE IN BARKING IN EAST 
LONDON SLEEPING UPSTAIRS IN A BACK 
BEDROOM ON A MATTRESS ON THE FLOOR 
WHEN THE HOUSE WAS SEARCHED POLICE 
FOUND A MOBILE PHONE WITH JUST TWO 
NUMBERS IN THE MEMORY ONE WAS A 
NUMBER FROM PAKISTAN THE OTHER WAS 
FOR ONE OF THE OTHER ALLEGED 
LEADERS IN THE PLOT BUT WITH SOME 
OF THE NUMBERS CHANGE THE LAST 
FOUR DIGITS HAD HAD THE NUMBER ONE 
ADDED TO THEM HE USED TELEPHONE 
KIOSKS AND WAS USING INTERNATIONAL 
CALLING CARDS THERE WAS AN M. P. THREE 
PLAYER AT THE FLAT WITH A NUMBER OF 
SONGS BUT LYRICS LIKE I AM A 
TERRORIST AND BLOW THEM UP AND 
SLAUGHTER THEM 
THE FAMILIES OF THOSE KILLED IN THE 
OMAGH BOMBING BEGAN CIVIL CAWSE 
A CIVIL CASE AGAINST MEN THEY SAID 
WERE INVOLVED IN THE ATTACK TWENTY NINE 
PEOPLE DIED IN THE REAL I. R. A. BOMBING 
IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT NO ONE HAS BEEN CONVICTED 
THE OMAGH BOMBING WAS THE WORST 
SINGLE ATROCITY IN THE ZERO YEAR 
HISTORY OF THE NORTHERN IRELAND 
TROUBLES TWENTY NINE PEOPLE AND UNBORN 
TWINS WERE KILLED HUNDREDS MORE 
WERE INJURED THE FAMILIES' 
BARRISTER QUOTED THE SENIOR SURGEON 
AS DESCRIBING IT AS DISASTER OF 
BATTLEFIELD PROPORTIONS NO ONE HAS 
BEEN CONVICTED OF THE MURDERS AND 
ANY SUCH CONVICTION IS NOW HIGHLY 
UNLIKELY THE CIVIL CASES ON BEHALF 
OF SOME OF THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES 
IT WAS A 
DIFFICULT ONE VERY VERY DIFFICULT BUT VERY IMPORTANT IT'S 
SIGNIFICANT THE FACT WE HAVE 
ACTUALLY COME HERE AFTER SEVEN 
YEARS I THINK IT'S PROOF OF THE 
FACT THAT BOTH GOVERNMENTS HAVE 
FAILED US IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IT 
IS BASICALLY LEFT UP TO VICTIMS TO 
SEEK JUSTICE FOR THEMSELVES THE THE FAMILIES' CASE IT IS AGAINST FIVE 
MEN COLM MURPHY CURRENTLY 
AWAITING A RETRIAL ON CONSPIRACY 
CHARGES LINKED TO THE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT ATTACK 
LIAM CAMPBELL SEAMUS DALY SEAMUS 
MCKENNA AND MICHAEL MCKEVITT WHO 
IS IN JAIL IN THE REPUBLIC FOR 
DIRECT TERRORISM ROD DANIEL 
BRENNAN Q. C. OPENING THE FAMILY'S 
CASE SAID IT WAS UNIQUE UNIT IN 
THE U. K. AND PERHAPS IN THE WORLD 
THAT PRIVATE CITIZENS WERE 
CONFRONTING TERRORISM UNIQUE HE 
SAID FIVE MEN WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
THE BOMBING THE CASE IS EXPECTED 
TO LAST EIGHT WEEKS ALSO UNIQUELY 
THE COURT WILL SIT IN DUBLIN FOR 
TWO WEEKS TO TAKE EVIDENCE FROM 
POLICE OFFICERS IN THE REPUBLIC 
DENNIS IS IN BELFAST THE CARS 
FOR US A CIVIL CASE WILL BE DEALT 
WITH DIFFERENTLY FROM A CRIMINAL 
ONE 
YES IT IS FASCINATING FOR ONE LEGAL ANORAKS IF ANYONE REMEMBERS 
THE O. J. SIMPSON CASE IN THE UNITED 
STATES IT IS THE SAME SET UP IN A 
CRIMINAL CASE THE PROSECUTION 
NEEDS TO PROVE GUILT BEYOND 
REASONABLE DOUBT IN A CIVIL CASE 
THE PLAINTIFF THE FAMILY'S HAVE 
TO JUST SATISFY THE JUDGE ON THE 
BASIS OF PROBABILITY THE FAMILYS 
THEY ARE ACCUSING THESE FIVE MEN OF 
SUCH A SERIOUS SCALE OF CRIME THAT 
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A HIGHER BAR 
SET FOR THEM ON THIS BASIS OF 
PROBABILITY THEIR Q. C. SAID IT WOULD 
BE A SOLID WIDE RANGING LOOK AT 
THE EVIDENCE WHICH WOULD FULLY 
EXPOSE THE ACTIVITIES OF THE REAL 
I. R. A. AND ITS LEADERS THERE WILL BE 
FORENSIC EVIDENCE HEARSAY IS 
ADMISSIBLE AT THIS LEVEL SO YOU 
CAN HEAR FROM INTELLIGENCE SOURCES 
WHICH YOU CAN'T IN A CRIMINAL CASE 
FOR NOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
IN MARCH NINETEEN FORTY ONE AT THE HEIGHT OF THE 
BLITZ GERMAN BOMBERS RAIDED 
CLYDEBANK AMONG THE INJURED WAS 
JOHN GRAY WHO LOST THE USE OF HIS 
RIGHT EYE HE COPED FOR DECADES BUT 
A FEW YEARS AGO HE STARTED TO GO 
BLIND IN HIS LEFT EYE AS WELL 
SURGEONS DECIDED TO SEE IF THEY 
COULD DO ANYTHING ABOUT HIS WARTIME 
INJURY B. B. C. SCOTLAND'S HEALTH 
CORRESPONDENT PICKS UP THE STORY 
IN MARCH NINETEEN FORTY ONE THE GERMANS CARRIED 
OUT A DEVASTATING BOMBING RAID ON 
CLYDESIDE 
YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE CLYDESIDE THE PLANES IT WAS A BRIGHT 
MOONLIT NIGHT IT MUST HAPPEN 
SOMETIME AFTER MIDNIGHT IT MUST 
HAVE BEEN WE HEARD SOME GLASS 
SHATTERING I REMEMBER A BANK JOHN JOHN WAS BURIED ALIVE FOR EIGHT HOURS 
BANK ONE HAD A HEAD INJURY WHICH TOOK 
THE SIDE AWAY FROM MY RIGHT AWAY THE SITE AWAY FROM MY RIGHT EYE L. 
DIDN'T REALISE IT WOULD BE GONE FOR 
GOOD A FEW YEARS AGO THE SIGHT IN 
HIS LEFT EYE STARTED TO DETERIORATE 
I NOTICED THAT THE TISSUE AT THE 
BACK OF HIS RIGHT EYE DID NOT SEEM 
TO BE AS BADLY DAMAGED AS THE 
TISSUE AT THE FRONT OF HIS EYE WE 
PUT IT ON THE BACK BURNER BECAUSE 
HE WAS SEEING PERFECTLY WELL WITH 
HIS LEFT EYE THE GENERAL RULE OF 
THUMB IS TO LEAVE IT 
BUT NOW A 
SPARE WAS EXACTLY WHAT JOHN NEEDED 
HE WAS REFERRED TO A SPECIALIST 
WHO CUT AWAY THE OLD SCARRED LENS 
WE PERFORMED IN OPERATION TO PLACE 
A PLASTIC LENS INTO HIS EYE AN 
OPERATION 
NOW HIS VISION IS GOOD OPERATION ENOUGH TO READ SMALL PRINT AND EVEN 
SIT A DRIVING TEST 
IT MAY STILL 
IMPROVE YET I DON'T KNOW L. AM DELIGHTED WITH THE WAY IT IS 
IT HAS BEEN A LOT QUIETER TODAY 
THAN IT WAS DURING THE WEEKEND 
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY CAUSING A LOT 
OF DISRUPTION ACROSS THE U. K. STILL 
SOME WINTRY SHOWERS WE ARE SITTING 
IN THE COLD AIR BUT WE HAVE NOT HAD 
QUITE AS MANY PROBLEMS THIS 
AFTERNOON WE COULD SEE SCENES LIKE 
THIS BUT PROBABLY MORE TEMPORARILY 
THAN THOSE WE SAW AT THE WEEKEND 
THERE ARE STILL SOME SHOWERS WHICH 
ARE HEAVY ENOUGH TO BRING COVERINGS 
OF SNOW BUT SOME SUNNY SPELLS IN 
BETWEEN THE SUN HAS GOT A BIT OF 
STRENGTH TO IT NOW IN APRIL SOME 
SNOW ACROSS THE FALLER THE HIGHER 
GROUND OF SCOTLAND CLOSE TO THE 
COAST THE SHOWERS WILL TEND TO BE 
RAIN FURTHER INLAND ALMOST 
ANYWHERE ACROSS SCOTLAND AND THE 
NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND ALWAYS A 
CHANCE OF A BIT OF SLEET AS THE 
SHOWERS POSSIBLY GET HEAVIER ACROSS 
HIGHER GROUND MAY BE TURNING TO 
SNOW AS WELL THESE ARE THE TOP 
TEMPERATURES EIGHT DEGREES CELSIUS 
AT BEST YOU WILL BENEFIT FROM 
THOSE IF YOU CAN STAY OUT OF THE 
BREEZE AND IN THE SUNSHINE IN THE 
SHOWERS IT WILL FEEL A LOT COLDER 
SOME SUNNY SPELLS THE NORTHERN 
IRELAND IN THE NEXT HOUR BUT 
FREQUENT SHOWERS PUSHING IN WE 
WILL SEE INCREASING AMOUNTS OF 
CLOUD AS WELL MOST OF THE SHOWERS 
WILL DIE OUT THIS EVENING WE ARE 
LOOKING AT A PRETTY FINE END TO THE 
DAY BUT COLD NIGHT THANKS TO THE 
CLEARING SKIES WE WILL DEVELOP BE 
WIDESPREAD FROST A LITTLE MILDER 
FURTHER NORTH THANKS TO THE BREEZE 
WIDESPREAD FROST TOMORROW
