I. M. GEORGE ALAGIAH IN JOHANNESBURG 
ZIMBABWE'S OPPOSITION THROWS DOWN 
THE GAUNTLET ROBERT MUGABE IS 
STILL IN CHARGE BUT THE N. D. C. SAYS 
ITS MAN WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT 
OF ZIMBABWE 
I AM KIRSTY LANG IN LONDON WE WILL 
BE LIVE LATER IN THE PROGRAMME IN 
ROMANIA FOR THE NATO SUMMIT IT IS 
THE BIGGEST EVER MEETING OF THE 
WESTERN ALLIANCE THERE ARE BIG 
DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE KEY 
MEMBERS MEMBERS A KEY PLAYER IN THE IRISH PEACE 
PROCESS STEPS DOWN BERTIE AHERN IS 
TO RESIGN FOLLOWING AN 
INVESTIGATION INTO HIS FINANCES 
GOOD EVENING FROM JOHANNESBURG 
FINALLY AFTER FOUR DAYS 
ZIMBABWE'S ELECTION COMMISSION HAD 
AT LAST ADMITTED THAT THE RULING 
PARTY ZANU P. F. THE PARTY OF ROBERT 
MUGABE HAS LOST ITS PARLIAMENTARY 
MAJORITY IT IS THE FIRST TIME IN 
NEARLY THIRTY YEARS BUT ON THE CRUCIAL 
QUESTION OF THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE 
THERE HAS BEEN SILENCE TODAY THE 
OPPOSITION M. D. C. TOOK MATTERS INTO 
ITS OWN HANDS IT SAID IT HAD SOME 
RESULTS OF ITS ZONE WHICH SHOWED 
THAT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI WILL BE THE 
COUNTRY'S NEXT PRESIDENT LET'S 
LOOK AT THE FIGURES THAT THEY SAY 
THEY HAVE THEY CLAIM THAT MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI WON FIVE HUNDRED THREE PER CENT OF THE 
PRESIDENTIAL VOTE THAT IS AHEAD OF 
ROBERT MUGABE WHO THEY CLAIM GOT 
ONLY FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT THE RESPONSE FROM THE 
GOVERNMENT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WAS 
SWIFT IT SAID IT WOULD CRACK DOWN 
ON ANYBODY WHO THREATENED THE 
AUTHORITY OF THE GOVERNMENT THE 
B. B. C. HAS BEEN BANNED FROM ZIMBABWE 
BUT OUR CORRESPONDENT IAN PANNELL 
HAS MANAGED TO GET INTO THE COUNTRY 
A VICTORY DANCE FOR ZIMBABWE'S 
OPPOSITION CONFIRMATION THAT THEY 
ARE LIKELY TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE 
COUNTRY'S PARLIAMENT FOR THE FIRST 
TIME MOST HAVE LITTLE ACCESS TO 
THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND HAVE TO RELY 
ON STATE CONTROL STATE CONTROLLED 
MEDIA FOR NEWS THE RESULTS HAVE 
BEEN SLOWLY DRIP FED TO A COUNTRY 
DESPERATE FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
WE WANT TO WORK WE WANT TO CHANGE 
ZIMBABWE 
FOUR DAYS AFTER THEY ZIMBABWE VOTED PEOPLE STILL DON'T KNOW WHO 
THEIR NEXT PRESIDENT WILL BE THE 
OPPOSITION THINKS IT HAS WAITED 
LONG ENOUGH AND TODAY THEY MADE 
THEIR OWN DECLARATION PRESIDENT PRESIDENT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI HAS WON THIS 
ELECTION THE OPPOSITION IS IN THE 
MAJORITY ZANU P. F. HAS LOST THE 
ELECTION 
THIS IS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE WANT 
CHANGE WE FILMED SECRETLY AS WE 
EXCHANGED MONEY ON THE BLACK MARKET 
THE FIGURES ARE BEWILDERING 
ZIMBABWE HAS HYPERINFLATION AND 
PRICES DOUBLE EVERY FEW DAYS FOR 
DOLLARS I WAS GIVEN FOUR HUNDRED 
MILLION ZIMBABWEAN DOLLARS TEN DOLLARS 
THE PROBLEM IS COMING FROM THE N. D. C. 
THE UNITED KINGDOM AND UNITED 
STATES THEY ARE SO EAGER TO SEE 
THE BACK OF ROBERT MUGABE THEY 
WANT HIM TO GO 
ZIMBABWE IS ON THE 
VERGE OF HISTORIC CHANGE BUT IT IS 
STILL NOT GUARANTEED FEARS OF A 
BACKLASH ARE VERY REAL 
IN JOHANNESBURG I HAVE ELINOR 
SISULU FROM N. G. O. CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE 
IT IS AN ORGANISATION THAT BRINGS 
TOGETHER LAWYERS DOCTORS AND 
CHURCH GROUPS THEY HAVE SPENT A 
LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT THIS 
HUMANITARIAN SITUATION INSIDE THE 
COUNTRY WELCOME THANK YOU FOR 
BEING WITH US THE HUMANITARIAN 
SITUATION PRESUMABLY THAT IS JUST 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS DRIVEN 
PEOPLE'S DESIRE FOR CHANGE IN THE 
COUNTRY 
YES IT IS A DISASTROUS COUNTRY SITUATION IF YOU LOOK AT A LIFE 
EXPECTANCY OF THIRTY FOUR YEARS FOR WOMEN 
AND THIRTY SEVEN YEARS FOR MEN THAT GIVES AN 
INDICATION OF JUST THE EXTENT OF 
THE CATASTROPHE THEN YOU HAVE THE 
INTRICACIES OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 
THEY HAVE DROPPED DRAMATICALLY 
INFANT MORTALITY THE HEALTH 
SERVICES ARE COLLAPSING THE FOOD 
SITUATION FOUR MILLION ZIMBABWEANS 
NEED FOOD AID THE HYPERINFLATION 
OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PER CENT AT THAT MEANS PEOPLE 
CAN BARELY AFFORD TO SURVIVE THIS 
ELECTION I THINK THE ELECTORATE 
PUT THEIR HOPE IN THE FUTURE WITH 
THE NEW CANDIDATES CLEARLY THEY 
COULD SEE NO END TO THE ECONOMIC 
I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN CRISIS TALKING TO PEOPLE INSIDE ZIMBABWE 
YOU WERE THERE LAST WEEK THIS LONG 
DRAWN OUT PROCESS WITH UPS AND 
DOWNS RESULTS NO RESULTS WHAT 
TOLL 
IS THAT TAKING ON PEOPLE IT IT IS TAKING A VERY SERIOUS TOLL ON 
PEOPLE'S HEALTH THERE ARE A LOT OF 
ZIMBABWEANS IN SOUTH AFRICA I SAW 
ONE OF THEM TODAY A POLITICAL 
REFUGEE HE HAD LOST WEIGHT HE HAD 
HARDLY BEEN EATING AND SLEEPING FOR 
THE PAST FEW DAYS HE WAS SO 
ANXIOUS PEOPLE WANT TO GO HOME 
BUT HIS IS A REALLY LIFE AND DEATH 
SITUATION FOR MANY PEOPLE 
WE HAVE 
BEEN DESCRIBING JUST NOW HOW AWFUL 
LIFE IS FOR MANY PEOPLE IN ZIMBABWE 
WHATEVER GOVERNMENT ZIMBABWE HAS IN 
THE FUTURE IT IS A MASSIVE TASK 
DO YOU THINK THERE IS THE CAPACITY 
INSIDE ZIMBABWE TO DEAL WITH THAT 
KIND OF JOB 
THE CAPACITY IS THERE 
THE EXTENT OF THE CATASTROPHE IS 
GOING TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT THE 
FIRST TASK WILL BE TO BRING DOWN 
THAT INFLATION RATE DOWN TO NORMAL 
OR NEAR NORMAL LEVELS ALSO ONE OF 
THE FIRST CATASTROPHE IS IS GOING 
TO BE THE GOVERNOR OF THE RESERVE 
BANK WHAT A LOT OF ZIMBABWEANS 
CALLED THE ECONOMIC LUNACY OF 
DECISIONS SUCH AS PRICE CONTROLS 
BEFORE THE ELECTIONS PRESIDENT 
MUGABE WAS CARRYING OUT THREATS 
AGAINST THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY 
SAYING THEY WOULD HAVE TO CUT 
PRICES I THINK PEOPLE SAW THIS 
WOULD MEAN THERE WOULD BE NO GOODS 
IN THE SHOPS AND THAT THE SUFFERING 
WOULD CONTINUE 
WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT 
THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
NOW MORGAN TSVANGIRAI IS A VETERAN 
OF ZIMBABWEAN POLITICS IN FACT 
THIS IS THE FOURTH TIME THE N. D. C. HAS 
CONTESTED ZANU P. F. THE FOURTH TIME 
THESE MEN HAVE GONE HEAD TO HEAD 
ONE THING WE KNOW ABOUT HIM IS THAT 
HE IS VERY GOOD AT OPPOSING A 
REGIME BUT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME 
PERHAPS PEOPLE ASKING THE QUESTION 
WHAT KIND OF LEADER WILL HE MAKE 
THE MAN ON WHOM MILLIONS ARE 
PINNING THEIR HOPES THE SON OF A 
BRICKLAYER HE WORKED FOR TEN YEARS 
IN A NICKEL MINE BEFORE CUTTING HIS 
TEETH IN TRADE UNION POLITICS HE 
MADE HIS NAME IN THE TOUGH ECONOMIC 
TIMES OF THE NINETEEN NINETIES WHEN A 
COMBINATION OF DROUGHT AND HIGH 
UNEMPLOYMENT PUSHED THOUSANDS INTO 
POVERTY HE ORGANISED A SERIES OF 
NATIONWIDE STRIKES 
HE BASICALLY 
GALVANISED THE NATIONAL UNION OF 
TRADE UNIONS IN ZIMBABWE REFORMED 
THEM FROM AN ORGANISATION WHICH WAS 
SLIPPY IT HAD BEEN FORMED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT AFTER INDEPENDENCE 
SLIPPY HE REFORMED BAD 
ORGANISATION INTO AN ACT OF VERY 
EFFECTIVE WORKERS 
SOON AFTER 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI FOUNDED THE 
MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE 
PARTY HE CAMPAIGNED WELL AND WON 
MANY SEATS IN PARLIAMENTARY 
ELECTIONS BUT IN THIS TWO THOUSAND TWO 
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN HE FAILED TO 
OUST MR. MUGABE IT CAME AMID 
ACCUSATIONS OF BALLOT RIGGING THE 
M. D. C. HAS BEEN A PERSISTENT THORN IN 
ROBERT MUGABE'S SIDE WHO HAS OFTEN 
SPOKEN OF HIS PREFERENCE FOR A ONE 
PARTY STATE THE GOVERNMENT HAS HAD 
TO ORGANISE EVER MORE INGENIOUS 
CAMPAIGNS OF INTIMIDATION AGAINST 
IT IT CULMINATED IN THE CLEARING 
OF SLUM AREAS HOUSING THEIR 
SUPPORTERS THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI HAS EARNED HIS 
PLACE AS A SUCCESSOR TO ROBERT 
MUGABE HE HAS BEEN A MAN BRAVE 
ENOUGH TO STAND UP AGAINST A 
PRESIDENT WHO STOP AT NOTHING TO 
STAY IN POWER THOSE WHO KNOW 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI AND WORK WITH HIM 
WORRY ABOUT HIS LEADERSHIP SKILLS 
THEY ARE TROUBLED THAT HE CAN BEAT 
INDECISIVE AND SURROUNDS HIMSELF 
WITH A SMALL CLIQUE OF AIDS AND 
HANDS OUT FAVOURS TO MEMBERS OF HIS 
FAMILY MANY QUESTION WHETHER HE 
WILL BE ABLE TO PUT AN AILING 
COUNTRY ON THE PATH TO HEALTH HIS 
REPUTATION WAS DAMAGED AFTER THE 
M. D. C. SPLIT THREE YEARS AGO AND BY 
ALLEGATIONS THAT HE IGNORES THE 
PARTY'S OWN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HE HE HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF RUNNING WHAT IS 
A KITCHEN CABINET I THINK WHAT HIS 
CRITICS ACCUSE HIM OF HIS 
SURROUNDING HIMSELF WITH A CLIQUE 
OF PEOPLE WHO SPEAK TO HIS 
INSECURITIES AND COMFORT HIM 
SYCOPHANTIC BASICALLY THESE 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO OVERRULE 
DECISIONS TAKEN BY THE PARTY BUT BUT ORDINARY ZIMBABWEANS WOULD FORGIVE 
ALL OF THIS IF HE CAME TO POWER AND 
LIFTED THEM OUT OF ECONOMIC 
MELTDOWN HE IS ADMIRED FOR BEING 
THE ULTIMATE SURVIVOR MORGAN MORGAN TSVANGIRAI SEEMS TO HAVE STOOD FOR 
GOOD DEMOCRATIC VALUES IN SPITE 
OF THE OPPOSITION THAT HE RECEIVED 
FROM THE GOVERNMENT HE HAS STOOD 
THE TEST OF TIME 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
HAS FOUGHT AGAINST CHARGES OF 
TREASON THREE ASSASSINATION 
ATTEMPTS AND LAST YEAR A SEVERE 
BEATING AT THE HANDS OF POLICE HE 
EMERGED BRUISED BUT NOT BOWED HIS 
POLITICAL PATH HAS BEEN RULING BUT 
HE COULD BE ABOUT TO REAP THE 
ULTIMATE REWARD 
NOW THESE ELECTIONS ARE BEING 
WATCHED BY THE MILLIONS OF 
ZIMBABWEANS WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR 
COUNTRY ONE OF THOSE IS JONATHAN 
CHAWORA HE IS THE U. K. CHAIRMAN OF 
THE M. D. C. WE CAN CROSS TO HIM IN 
BIRMINGHAM IN BRITAIN THANK YOU 
FOR BEING WITH US MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI WAS NOT ACTUALLY THERE 
WHEN HIS PARTY CLAIMED THE 
PRESIDENCY FOR ITSELF SOME PEOPLE 
ARE SAYING HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
THERE 
WELL I CANNOT SAY WHY HE THERE WAS NOT THERE BUT HE WAS 
DEFINITELY THERE FOR THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE YESTERDAY OBVIOUSLY 
THERE ARE SECURITY ISSUES THAT HAVE 
BEEN SURROUNDING THE ELECTION THE THE REASON I ASK THE QUESTION IS THERE 
HAS BEEN AND SOME OF IT WAS THERE 
IN THE REPORT WE HAVE JUST HEARD 
THERE HAS BEEN A PERSISTENT 
QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER WHEN IT 
COMES TO IT HE IS WILLING TO MAKE 
THE FINAL CONFRONTATION THAT IS 
WHAT HE HAS LACKED IN THE PAST I I DON'T THINK THAT IS A FAIR 
ASSESSMENT IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THE 
LAST EIGHT YEARS IN ZIMBABWE AT 
THE STRUGGLING ZIMBABWE YOU WILL 
FIND THAT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI HAS 
BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE 
STRUGGLE HE IS NOT AFRAID TO TAKE 
THE STRUGGLE HEAD ON I DON'T THINK 
IT IS A FAIR ASSESSMENT AT ALL I I ASSUMED THAT THE M. D. C. AND PEOPLE 
LIKE YOURSELVES ACCEPT THE 
PARLIAMENTARY RESULT WE ALSO 
ACCEPT THE PRESIDENTIAL RESULT 
WHATEVER IT IS WHEN IT IS 
ANNOUNCED BY THE ZIMBABWE ELECTION 
YES WE WILL ACCEPT THE COMMISSION RESULT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE 
RESULT WILL REFLECT WHAT ACTUALLY 
TRANSPIRED 
TO BE FAIR WE DON'T TRANSPIRED KNOW THAT WE KNOW WHAT DO YOU 
THINK THE RESULTS WERE THAT IS WHY 
I AM ASKING YOU WILL YOU ACCEPT 
THE RESULT WHATEVER THE ZIMBABWE 
ELECTORAL COMMISSION SAYS IT IS 
WELL DEFINITELY WE ARE SURE THAT 
WE WON THE ELECTION ON THE BASIS 
THAT THE RESULTS THAT HAVE BEEN 
ANNOUNCED BY THE SECRETARY GENERAL 
OF THE M. D. C. ARK BASED ON THE 
INFORMATION THAT WAS AUTHENTIC 
INFORMATION THAT WAS RECEIVED FROM 
THE POLLING STATIONS ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY 
FOR EXAMPLE WILL YOU COUNTRY CONTEST A RUN OFF IF THAT IS WHAT 
THE ZIMBABWE ELECTION COMMISSIONS 
THEY SHOULD HAVE AN SAYS SHOULD 
HAPPEN 
WE WILL CONTEST IN A RUN HAPPEN OFF BUT IT WILL BE UNDER PROTEST 
UNDER PROTEST YES 
VERY QUICKLY YES CAN YOU ALSO SAY WHETHER YOU THINK 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI OUGHT TO BE 
MAKING ANY DEALS OR TALKING TO THE 
MILITARY RIGHT NOW THERE ARE 
RUMOURS THAT IS WHAT HE IS DOING 
OBVIOUSLY THOSE ARE RUMOURS WHAT 
I CAN SAY IS THAT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
HAS ALREADY MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE 
IS READY TO FORM A GOVERNMENT OF 
NATIONAL UNITY TO INVOLVE OTHER 
STAKEHOLDERS SO THAT THE COUNTRY 
MOVES ON 
WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH 
US US INTERESTING WHAT HE WAS SAYING 
THAT THE M. P. C. WOULD MOST LIKELY 
ACCEPT A RUN OFF AND CONTESTED BUT 
UNDER PROTEST THAT IS IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE THIS THING IS POSSIBLY FAR 
FROM OVER A STATE RUN NEWSPAPER 
INSIDE ZIMBABWE SAID TODAY THAT A 
RUN OFF WAS QUITE LIKELY THAT 
COULD TAKE ANOTHER TWO TO THREE 
WEEKS PLENTY OF TIME FOR THE 
ACCUSATIONS AND COUNTER ACCUSATIONS 
PLENTY OF TIME FOR VOTE RIGGING 
WHICH IS WHAT THE ALLEGATION IS 
AND PLENTY OF TIME FOR SOME OF THE 
VIOLENCE THAT MANY PEOPLE HAD BEEN 
WORRIED ABOUT WITH THAT BACK TO 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE OTHER NEWS 
FRANCE SPAIN AND SWITZERLAND HAVE 
LAUNCHED A MISSION TO HELP THE 
HIGH PROFILE HOSTED INGRID 
BETANCOURT WHO HAS BEEN HELD BY 
REBELS IN COLOMBIA MS. BETANCOURT 
HAS DUAL FRENCH AND COLOMBIAN 
NATIONALITY AND HAS BEEN HELD BY 
F. A. R. C. REBELS FOR MORE THAN SIX YEARS 
SHE'S REPORTEDLY EXTREMELY ILL THE 
FRENCH PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY 
AND MS. BETANCOURT MS. BETANCOURT'S 
CHILDREN HAVE APPEALED TO FREE HER 
BEFORE SHE DIES CHINA'S HUMAN 
RIGHTS RECORD IS GETTING WORSE IN 
THE RUN UP TO ELECTIONS THE HUMAN 
RIGHTS GROUPS SAY THAT BEIJING HAS 
NOW CLAMPING DOWN ON DISSENT IN A 
BID TO PORTRAY A STABLE AND 
HARMONIOUS IMAGE AHEAD OF THE GAMES 
IN AUGUST SEVEN REBELS HAVE BEEN 
KILLED AFTER CLASHES BETWEEN 
TURKISH SOLDIERS AND KURDISH REBELS 
NEAR TURKEY'S BORDER WITH IRAQ THE 
TURKISH MILITARY SAYS THE REBELS 
WERE KILLED IN SOUTH EASTERN 
PROVINCE OF SIRNAK IN THE PAST TWO 
DAYS OPINION POLL COMMISSIONED BY 
THE B. B. C. SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE AROUND 
THE WORLD 
OF THE UNITED STATES THAN THEY DID 
AT THIS TIME LAST YEAR SEVENTEEN 
COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN SURVEYED FOR 
THE POLL FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THERE HAS 
BEEN ANY INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE SAYING THAT AMERICA HAS A 
POSITIVE INFLUENCE IN THE WORLD A 
MEMORIAL SERVICES TAKING PLACE IN 
BRITAIN FOR THE EVEREST EXPLORER 
SIR EDMUND HILLARY THE 
MOUNTAINEERS FAMILY FRIENDS AND 
FANS ATTENDED THE SERVICE AT 
WINDSOR CASTLE AS TO THE QUEEN AND 
NEW ZEALAND'S HELEN CLARK HE DIED 
OF HEART ATTACK IN JANUARY AT THE 
AGE OF EIGHTY EIGHT HE SCALED THE WORLD'S 
HIGHEST MOUNTAIN OF TENZING NORGAY 
NOW TO ROMANIA WHICH IS HOSTING 
THE BIGGEST EVER NATO SUMMIT TWENTY SIX 
COUNTRIES AND MEMBERS OF THE 
ALLIANCE BUT THIS PARTICULAR 
MEETING INCLUDES DELEGATES FROM 
OTHER NATIONS SOME OF WHOM ARE 
EXTREMELY KEEN TO JOIN NATO THIS 
IS CAUSING SOME PROBLEMS THE 
UNITED STATES WOULD LIKE SEE 
MACEDONIA AND THE FORMER SOVIET 
BLOC STATES OF UKRAINE AND GEORGIA 
JOINING BUT THERE ARE SOME SHARP 
DIVISIONS IN EUROPE OVER THIS THE 
OTHER MAJOR ISSUE AT THE SUMMIT IS 
AFGHANISTAN PRESIDENT BUSH IS 
CALLING FOR NATO MEMBERS TO PLEDGE 
MORE TROOPS PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH 
WAS THE FIRST NATO LEADER TO ARRIVE 
IN BUCHAREST FOR MEETINGS THAT THE 
SUMMITS ROMANIANS HOSTS WHO TOOK 
HIM TO THE PRESIDENTIAL SEASIDE 
RESORT ON THE SHORES OF THE BLACK 
SEA HE TOOK THE CHANCE TO GET 
AMERICA'S MESSAGE ACROSS MAKING IT 
CLEAR MORE TROOPS WERE NEEDED FOR 
THE MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN CALLING 
ON OTHER NATO ALLIES TO SHOW THAT 
THEY'RE PART OF THE BURDEN 
THIS IS 
A VITAL MISSION AND IT'S HARD WORK 
IT'S A TOUGH MISSION OUR LACK 
ALLIES HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IT'S HARD 
TAKING DEMOCRACY OUT OF THE RUBBLE 
OF THE TALEBAN IS HARD TO DO JUST 
LIKE IT IS IN IRAQ THE QUESTION 
THE NATIONS HAVE TO ASK IS IS IT 
WORTH IT MY ANSWER IS IT IS WORTH 
IT IT'S WORTH IT FOR OUR OWN 
SECURITY AND FOR THE CAUSE OF PEACE 
THE MAIN DISAGREEMENT AT THE SUMMIT 
WILL BE OVER AFGHANISTAN ON THAT 
NATO IS UNITED IN ITS INTENTIONS 
BUT OVER EXPANSION EASTWARDS THE 
SETTING FOR THIS SUMMIT AT NICKEL I 
TRIED TESCO BOSS TO BE AS GRAND 
PALACE IS JUST A REMINDER OF HOW 
FAR EAST NATO HAS EXPANDED BUT 
WARY OF RUSK RUSSIA FRANCE AND 
GERMANY SATE IT IS TIME FOR THE 
FIRST STEPS TO BE TAKEN TO NATO 
MEMBERSHIP THAT STANDS WHEN AN 
ANGRY REBUKE FROM OF GEORGIA IT IT WILL MAKE OUR REFORM AGENDA MORE 
DIFFICULT BUT WE WILL CONTINUE 
THOSE REFORMS BECAUSE WE ARE DOING 
IT FOR OURSELVES NOT FOR SOMEBODY 
ELSE BUT IT WILL BE FOR RUSSIA 
PEOPLE IN THE KREMLIN WHO THINK 
THAT BY A POLICY OF BLACKMAIL BY 
ARROGANCE BY AGGRESSIVE STEPS OR 
STATEMENT THEY CAN INFLUENCE 
DECISION MAKING INSIDE NATO NATO NATO LEADERS GATHERED HERE FOR A 
WORKING DINNER TONIGHT MAY TRY TO 
FUDGE THE ISSUE AND OFFER A 
DIFFERENT WAY OF GIVING UKRAINE AND 
GEORGIA EVENTUAL MEMBERSHIP BOTH 
CROATIA AND ALBANIA ARE LIKELY TO 
BE INVITED TO JOIN THE ALLIANCE 
ALTHOUGH GREECE MAY BE LIKELY TO 
HINDER MACEDONIA'S ACCEPTANCE 
UNTIL A DISPUTE OVER ITS NAME IS 
SOLVED HE WAS A KEY PLAYER IN THE 
NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE PROCESS AND 
HE PRESIDED OVER NORTHERN IRELAND'S 
EXTRAORDINARY ECONOMIC BOOM BUT 
NOW THE PRIME MINISTER BERTIE AHERN 
HAS ANNOUNCED HE IS RESIGNING IN 
EARLY MAY BECAUSE OF ALLEGATIONS 
OF CORRUPTION HE TOLD A PRESS 
COMES TODAY THAT HE HAD DONE 
NOTHING WRONG HE SIDESTEPPED DOWN 
SO THAT HIS GOVERNMENT CAN GET ON 
WITH RUNNING THE COUNTRY HE HAS 
BEEN INVOLVED IN A TRIBUNAL THAT 
HAS BEEN LOOKING AT HIS FINANCIAL 
AFFAIRS AND PROPERTY DEALS 
I WILL 
BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT I HAVE MADE 
MISTAKES IN MY LIFE AND MY CAREER 
ONE MISTAKE I HAVE NEVER MADE WAS 
TO ENRICH MYSELF BY MISUSING THE 
TRUST OF THE PEOPLE I'VE NEVER 
RECEIVED A CORRUPT PAYMENT AND I'VE 
NEVER DONE ANYTHING TO DO THAN AT 
ANY OF THIS THAT I'VE EVER HELD 
DISHONOUR 
IT'S GO LIVE TO OUR DISHONOUR IRELAND CORRESPONDENT WHY IS HE 
GOING NOW 
BECAUSE OF THIS TRIBUNAL 
HE HAS HAD TO GIVE EVIDENCE TO IT 
PERSISTENT ALLEGATIONS OVER HIS 
PRIVATE FINANCES ONE IN PARTICULAR 
WHICH WAS PAID INTO A BUILDING 
SOCIETY ACCOUNT WHICH HE SAID HE 
USED FOR HIS SALARY BUT THIS WAS A 
PAYMENT OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS 
IT WAS IN STERLING SO IT COULD NOT 
POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN HIS SALARY HE 
HAS AN ACCOUNTED FOR THAT THIS IS 
CLEARLY NOT THE TIME OF HIS 
CHOOSING THAT HE IS GOING OUT HE 
SAYS IT'S TO PROTECT THE PARTY AND 
THE GOVERNMENT BUT I THINK IT 
BECAME INEVITABLE THAT HE WOULD GO 
BUT THE TIMING WAS A SURPRISE I 
DON'T EVEN THINK HIS CABINET 
COLLEAGUES THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO 
DO IT SO SOON 
HE PRESIDED OVER AN 
ELECTION VICTORY NOT THAT LONG AGO 
THIS IS AN HISTORIC THIRD TERM OVER 
AN ECONOMIC BOOM DOES HE REMAIN 
QUITE POPULAR WITH IRISH VOTERS HE HE DOES ONE OF THE IRISH RADIO 
STATIONS RAN A PHONE POLL AND FIFTY FIVE PER CENT 
OF TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO TEXTING IN 
FELT HE WAS RIGHT TO GO BECAUSE IT 
WAS STARTING TO SOUR THE WHOLE 
POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE AS EVER WITH 
THESE ALLEGATIONS WHEN THE 
GOVERNMENT WAS TRYING TO GET OUT 
WHAT IT THOUGHT WAS GOOD NEWS LIKE 
INVESTMENT AND SO FORTH AND 
CREATING JOBS IT WAS ALWAYS ON 
PAGE SIX WHEREAS ALLEGATIONS ABOUT 
MR. AHERNE WERE ON PAGE ONE HE HAD 
A BRILLIANT COMMON TOUCH AND I 
THINK HE HAS THIS IN COMMON WITH 
TONY BLAIR IN THE SHORT TERM TONY 
BLAIR STILL HAS A SHADOW OVER HIM 
IN THE POPULAR MIND BECAUSE OF 
GOING TO WAR IN IRAQ BUT IN THE 
LONGER TERM I THINK HE WILL BE 
REMEMBERED FOR THE NORTHERN IRELAND 
PEACE PROCESS STUNNING POLITICAL 
ACHIEVEMENT AND I THINK THE SAME 
THING IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH 
BERTIE AHERN HE WILL HAVE TO GO 
ONE BETTER THAN THESE FIGHTING 
THESE ALLEGATIONS AND GIVING 
EVIDENCE AT THE TRIBUNAL BUT I 
THING IN THE LONGER TERM HE WILL BE 
REMEMBERED ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU 
HAVE JUST MENTIONED THREE TERMS 
THE ECONOMY GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT 
AND STABILITY IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
HE ALSO ENDED POLITICAL INSTABILITY 
IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AT ONE 
POINT WHEN I WORKED IN DUBLIN FOR 
THE B. B. C. IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THERE WERE 
THREE GENERAL ELECTIONS IN EIGHTEEN 
MONTHS HE HAS BROUGHT STABILITY 
LET'S GO BACK NOW TO THE SUBJECT OF 
THE NATO SUMMIT WHICH IS TAKING 
PLACE IN BUCHAREST WE CAN JOIN OUR 
CORRESPONDENT PAUL ADAMS I WAS 
SAYING EARLIER THAT THERE HAS BEEN 
ISSUED RAUL OVER NEW MEMBERS BEING 
ADMITTED TO NATO WHAT IS THAT 
ABOUT AND CAN WE SEE A WAY THROUGH 
THAT DEADLOCK 
AM NOT SURE THAT IT 
IS A HUGE ROW BUT IT CERTAINLY A 
SHARP DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE 
VISION IN THE WAY NATO SHOULD BE 
GOING ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE 
GEORGE BUSH SAYING THAT MEMBERS OF 
MEMBERSHIP OF NATO SHOULD BE OPEN 
TO ANY EUROPEAN DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY 
A COUNTRY THAT IS WILLING TO SHARE 
THE BURDEN OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF 
BEING IN NATO ON THE OTHER HAND 
YOU HAVE MEMBERS FROM WESTERN 
EUROPE FRANCE GERMANY ITALY 
SPAIN ALL OF WHOM WONDER WHAT 
MEMBERSHIP OF THESE TWO COUNTRIES 
WERE DUE TO THE BALANCE OF POWER IN 
EUROPE BUT IT WILL DO TO THEIR 
RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND POINTING 
OUT QUITE JUSTIFIABLY THAT IN THE 
CASE OF GEORGIA YOU HAVE A COUNTRY 
WITH TWO UNRESOLVED TERRITORIAL 
DISPUTES IN THE CASE OF UKRAINE A 
COUNTRY WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE 
POPULATION STILL DOESN'T WANT TO 
JOIN NATO THEY DO RAISE SOME 
LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 
TIMING OF ALLOWING THESE TWO 
MEMBERS IN 
THAT TOOK ABOUT THE ARE 
THE ISSUE ON THE AGENDA 
AFGHANISTAN GEORGE BUSH HAS BEEN 
CALLING FOR MORE TROOPS THERE TO 
FIGHT THE TALEBAN IS HE GOING TO 
GET THEM 
REMAIN AT YOUR SPECIFIC 
DETAILS AT THIS SUMMIT THIS IS NOT 
THE MEETING AT WHICH THE SORDID 
BUSINESS OF TROOP NUMBERS IS 
DISCUSSED WE DO KNOW THAT 
PRESIDENT SARKOZY HAS COMMITTED TO 
SENDING MORE TROOPS WE DON'T KNOW 
EXACTLY HOW MANY OR WHERE THEY WILL 
GO AND WHAT ROLE THEY WILL PLAY 
THE GEORGIANS HAVE ALSO OFFERED AN 
EXTRA TROOPS GEORGE BUSH WAS ABLE 
TO SAY WITH SOME JUSTIFICATION 
TODAY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN EFFORTS 
TO MEET HIS AND OTHER CALLS FOR 
GREATER RESOURCES BUT I THINK 
THERE IS A SENSE OF WHICH NATO 
LEADERS ARE TAKING STOCK OF 
OPERATION AND MISSION IN 
AFGHANISTAN THE PURPOSE OF WHICH 
PERHAPS IS NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR TO 
EVERYONE OMISSION WHICH NEEDS TO 
BE REINVIGORATED THAT'S WHY WE'RE 
GOING TO SEE A NEW STRATEGIC VISION 
AND DOCUMENT EMERGING IT OUT OF 
THIS MEETING WHICH WILL SET FOR 
THE FIRST TIME BENCH MARKS BOTH 
FOR NATO AND THE AFGHAN SECURITY 
FORCES IN THE COMING MONTHS AND 
YEARS INTERESTINGLY WE'RE NOT 
GOING TO BE TOLD WHAT THOSE 
BENCHMARKS SARK THAT WILL BE AN 
INTERNAL NATO MATTER LET'S HOPE 
THERE IS A DIPLOMATIC AND LEAD IT 
TO US IN DUE COURSE 
PRESSURE ON 
GERMANY IN PARTICULAR TO DELIVER 
MORE TROOPS 
I THINK THERE IS A 
GRUDGING UNDERSTANDING OF GERMANY'S 
PREDICAMENT A VERY SPECIAL 
SITUATION IN WHICH THE GERMAN 
CONSTITUTION FORBIDS COMBAT 
OPERATIONS INVOLVING GERMAN FORCES 
YES YOU WILL HEAR ALL SORTS OF 
RAMBLING ABOUT THE FACT THAT 
GERMANY HAS STAYED UP IN THE NORTH 
OF AFGHANISTAN WHERE IT IS A 
RELATIVELY SAFE ENVIRONMENT BUT IT 
WILL ALSO HEAR NATO OFFICIALS 
SAYING NATO HAS A ROLE TO PLAY 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY OF 
AFGHANISTAN AND THAT ROLE DIFFERS 
ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT PLACES THE 
GERMANS ARE THERE IN NUMBERS AND 
THEY ARE PERFORMING AN IMPORTANT 
TASK MORE GENEROUS SPIRITS HE 
WOULD SAY LET'S NOT CHASTISE THEM 
TOO MUCH 
A QUICK REMINDER OF OUR 
MAIN USE THE PARTY OF ZIMBABWE'S 
PRESIDENT MUGABE ZANU P. F. HAS LOST 
ITS MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT AFTER A 
TWENTY EIGHT YEARS IN POWER THERE ARE STILL 
NO OFFICIAL RESULTS ON THE OTHER 
POLE THAT'S FOR HE WAS GOING TO BE 
PRESIDENT THE OPPOSITION M. D. C. 
SAYS ITS CANDIDATE MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI HAS WON AT THE STATE 
RUN MEDIA IS THE REPORTING THAT NO 
CANDIDATE HAS WON AN OVERALL 
MAJORITY WHAT WE MIGHT SEE IS A 
ONE OFF ELECTION SOMETIME IN THE 
NEXT THREE WEEKS PRESIDENT BUSH 
HAS SET OUT AN AGENDA FOR REVIVING 
THE NATO ALLIANCE MR. BUSH SAID 
THAT NATO MUST BE EXTENDED TO 
INCLUDE NEW MEMBERS INCLUDING 
UKRAINE AND GEORGIA THIS IS A MOVE 
WHICH RUSSIA IS STRONGLY AGAINST 
AND IT IS A MOVE THAT A NUMBER OF 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE AGAINST 
THIS IS WORLD NEWS TODAY THAT'S 
ALL FROM THE PROGRAMME NEXT IS THE 
WEATHER GOODBYE 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE WEATHER WILL BE 
MAKING THE HEADLINES AGAIN COME THE 
WEEKEND TURNING MUCH COLDER BUT 
SOME SNOW AROUND THAT'S STILL SOME 
WAY OFF AND TOMORROW IS SHAPING UP 
PRETTY WELL A LOT OF CLOUD AROUND 
AT THE MOMENT THE CLOUD IS TRAP 
AND RELUCTANT TO BREAK UP THIS 
WARM FRONT INJECTING A BIT MORE 
MOISTURE PRODUCING THE ODD SPOT OF 
RAIN ACROSS NORTH WEST SCOTLAND 
ELSEWHERE ANY DRIZZLY RAIN WILL 
DIE OUT AND THERE IS EVERY CHANCE 
THAT THE CLOUD WILL BREAK UP AND WE 
WILL SEE SOME SUNSHINE WHERE THE 
SUN DOES COME OUT IT WILL TURN VERY 
WARM INDEED IT IS COOLER AND 
DAMPER OUT WEST NORTH WEST ENGLAND 
STAYING CLOUDY BUT TO THE EAST OF 
THE PENNINES WE WILL SEE SOME 
BRIGHTNESS AND HIGH TEMPERATURES 
THE CLOUD MORE RELUCTANT TO BREAK 
UP ACROSS PARTS OF EAST ANGLIA AND 
THE SOUTH EAST EVEN SO UNDER THE 
CLOUD COVER COVER WE WILL REACH 
THE MID TEENS QUITE COMFORTABLY 
IN THE SOUTH WEST AND SOUTH WALES 
WE WILL SEE SOME WARM SUNSHINE 
MOST OF WALES ARE SHAPING UP PRETTY 
WELL A BIT MURKY TOWARDS SOME 
WESTERN COASTS NORTHERN IRELAND IS 
CLOUDY WITH BROKEN SUNSHINE 
LOOKING FURTHER AHEAD THE HIGH 
GRADUALLY SUBSIDES AWAY THIS COLD 
FRONT HERE WILL DO WHAT IT SAYS ON 
THE TIN IT WILL PRODUCE MUCH 
COLDER CONDITIONS FROM THE NORTH 
LATER ON FRIDAY LOWER TEMPERATURES 
ARRIVING ACROSS THE NORTH OF 
SCOTLAND AHEAD OF THAT BEFORE 
THAT COLD FRONT ARRIVES ANOTHER 
PLEASANT DAY
