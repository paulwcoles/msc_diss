THIS IS JACKANORY JUNIOR 
HI I'M HOLLY 
AND THIS STORY IS ALL ABOUT A MAN WHO HAD TOO MUCH 
A WOMAN WHO HAD TOO LITTLE 
AND A CAT WHO HAD JUST ENOUGH 
IT'S CALLED THE KING OF CAPRI 
THE KING OF CAPRI HAD BEEN OUT TO A PARTY 
AND IT WAS THE KIND OF PARTY KINGS LIKE BEST 
ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE THERE 
AND SOMEBODY HAD COOKED HIS FAVOURITE FOOD 
HE ATE AS MUCH AS HE COULD BUT NOT AS MUCH AS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED 
HE HAD A BUN IN ONE HAND JELLY IN THE OTHER 
BUT TRY AS HE MIGHT HE COULDN'T GET IT ALL INTO HIS MOUTH AT ONCE 
WHY HAVE I GOT TWO HANDS AND ONLY ONE MOUTH 
WONDERED THE KING 
HIS ADVISOR STOOD BEFORE HIM AND SAID 
IN THE KINGDOM 
THEY CAN HARDLY FEED ONE MOUTH EACH HOW COULD THEY EVER FEED TWO 
BUT THE KING NEVER DID THINK ABOUT THE POOR PEOPLE 
HE ONLY THOUGHT ABOUT HIMSELF 
IT WAS MIDNIGHT WHEN THE KING GOT BACK TO HIS PALACE 
ALL HIS SERVANTS WERE ASLEEP 
THE KING LOOKED AT HIMSELF IN THE MIRROR 
AND SAW THAT HE WAS COVERED IN ICE CREAM AND TREACLE 
AND EGG SANDWICH AND ORANGE JUICE AND BITS OF BANANA 
IF I HAD TWO MOUTHS HE SAID TO HIMSELF 
I SHOULDN'T BE IN THIS MESS 
HOW CAN ANYBODY BE EXPECTED TO GET ALL THEIR FOOD INTO JUST ONE MOUTH 
BUT WHAT COULD HE DO 
HE TOOK OFF ALL HIS DIRTY CLOTHES EXCEPT HIS SOCKS AND HIS CROWN 
PADDED OUT ONTO THE BALCONY AND PEGGED HIS CLOTHES ON THE LINE 
HE'D OFTEN SEEN CLOTHES HANGING ON THE LINE 
BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAVE TO WASH THEM FIRST 
THEN THE KING GOT INTO HIS BIG BED 
AND FELL ASLEEP 
CAPRI IS AN ISLAND 
THE KING'S PALACE SAT HIGH UP ON A CLIFF THAT LOOKED OUT TO SEA 
OFTEN THE KING WOULD LEAN ON HIS BALCONY 
AND ADMIRE THE VIEW OVER THE BAY OF NAPLES 
ACROSS THE BAY WAS THE CITY OF NAPLES 
WHERE A LOT OF POOR PEOPLE LIVED 
THE POOREST OF THEM ALL WAS A WASHER WOMAN CALLED MRS. JEWEL 
IF YOU WENT TO MRS. JEWEL'S HOUSE TO LOOK FOR HER 
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE HER 
FOR A START MRS. JEWEL WAS VERY SMALL 
AND HER TINY HOUSE WAS ALWAYS FULL OF STEAM 
THIS WAS BECAUSE SHE DID HER WASHING IN A GREAT BIG BOILER 
ALL DAY LONG THE BOILER BOILED AND BOILED 
WHILE MRS. JEWEL THREW IN THE DIRTY CLOTHES 
AND HAULED OUT THE CLEAN ONES 
AND NEVER GOT HER HEAD OUT OF THE STEAM 
MRS. JEWEL HAD A CAT 
THE CAT WAS CALLED WASH 
IT WAS MIDNIGHT 
MRS. JEWEL AND WASH HAD JUST FINISHED THEIR SUPPER 
MRS. JEWEL HAD EATEN A CHICKEN WING 
NINETEEN BAKED BEANS A TOMATO AND HALF A SLICE OF BREAD 
THEY WERE GOING TO SHARE A CUP OF MILK 
TWO MOUTHS TO FEED WASH SAID MRS. JEWEL 
BUT ONLY ONE SUPPER 
WASH RUBBED HIS HEAD AGAINST HER HAND 
HE WAS THE THINNEST CAT IN THE WORLD 
HE WAS SO THIN THAT IF HE SWALLOWED A MOUSE 
IT MADE A BIG BULGE IN HIS TUMMY LIKE A TENNIS BALL IN YOUR POCKET 
NO MATTER HOW HARD MRS. JEWEL WORKED SHE NEVER HAD ENOUGH MONEY 
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH EVERYONE WANTED CLEAN CLOTHES 
NO ONE WANTED TO PAY MUCH FOR THEM 
NEVER MIND SHE THOUGHT 
I WILL DO MY BEST AND SOMEDAY ALL THIS WILL CHANGE 
THAT NIGHT A GREAT TEMPEST BLEW IN ACROSS THE SEA 
ON CAPRI WHERE THE KING WAS SNORING LOUDLY IN HIS CROWN AND SOCKS 
THE FIRST THING THE WIND DID 
WAS TO BLOW THE PALACE GUARDS' CAPS 
THE SECOND THING THAT THE WIND DID 
WAS TO BLOW THE BIRDS OUT OF THE TREES 
THE THIRD THING IT DID 
WAS TO BLOW THE DECKCHAIRS OFF THE BEACH 
THE FOURTH THING IT DID 
WAS TO BLOW THE HANDS OFF THE CLOCK 
THE FIFTH THING WAS OH TO BLOW OFF THE NIGHT WATCHMEN'S MOUSTACHES 
THE SIXTH THING IT DID WAS TO BLOW THE WIGS OFF THE LADIES IN WAITING 
THE SEVENTH THING IT DID 
WAS TO BLOW THE PYJAMAS OFF ALL THE KING'S MEN 
THE EIGHTH THING IT DID 
WAS TO BLOW ALL THE MILK OUT OF THE COWS 
THE NINTH THING IT DID 
WAS TO BLOW ALL THE KING'S CLOTHES OFF HIS BALCONY 
IF YOU HAD LOOKED OVER THE BAY OF NAPLES THEN 
YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN THE KING'S VELVET BREECHES AND SILK SHIRT 
AND GOLDEN WAISTCOAT AND EMBROIDERED CLOAK 
ALL FLYING ACROSS THE SEA 
WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY LANDED 
THEY LANDED ON MRS. JEWEL'S WASHING LINE 
BUT SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT YET 
NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF CAPRI 
HAD THERE BEEN SUCH A WIND 
EVERYONE WAS WOKEN UP EXCEPT FOR THE KING 
WHO WAS SO FAT AND WEIGHED DOWN WITH BUNS AND JELLY 
EVEN A TEMPEST COULDN'T BLOW HIS HAIR ACROSS THE PILLOW 
BY MORNING THE NEWS WAS OUT 
EVERY SINGLE THING IN CAPRI 
EVERY POT PAN CHICKEN AND LOTTERY TICKET 
HAD BEEN BLOWN AWAY 
WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY HAD ALL LANDED 
IT WAS WASH WHO FOUND OUR FIRST 
HE YAWNED AND STRETCHED HIMSELF 
AND AS IT WAS DAYLIGHT HE THOUGHT HE'D GO FOR A WALK OUTSIDE 
MRS. JEWEL HAD A BIG BACK YARD WHERE SHE DRIED ALL HER LAUNDRY 
WHEN WASH HAD FINISHED YAWNING AND SNIFFING AND ROLLING AND LOOKING 
AND ALL THE THINGS CATS LIKE TO DO HE LAY DOWN HIGH UP ON THE WALL 
HIS BODY AS ORANGE AS THE SUN AND HIS EYES LIKE TWO GOLD COINS 
THE WIND WAS OUTSIDE 
GOOD MORNING WASH SAID THE WIND 
BUONGIORNO SAID WASH BY WHICH ITALIAN CATS MEAN GOOD MORNING 
I HAD A BIT OF A NIGHT LAST NIGHT SAID THE WIND 
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE STUFF IN YOUR BACK YARD 
NON C'E DI CHE SAID WASH WHO WASN'T TAKING ANY NOTICE 
AND SAID DON'T MENTION IT 
THEN WASH LOOKED 
THEN HE LOOKED AGAIN 
THEN HE LOOKED AGAIN AND AGAIN 
IT LOOKED AS IF THE WHOLE WORLD HAD PILED ITSELF UP 
IN MRS. JEWEL'S BACK YARD 
THERE WAS A BED WITH SOMEBODY IN IT 
ON TOP OF THE BED WAS A COW ON TOP OF THE COW A VACUUM CLEANER 
ON TOP OF THE VACUUM CLEANER A BICYCLE 
ON TOP OF THE BICYCLE A BOX OF APPLES 
ON TOP OF THE APPLES A DUCK 
ON TOP OF THAT A PAIR OF KNICKERS 
ON TOP OF THE PAIR OF KNICKERS WAS A BIG PAN OF CHICKEN SOUP 
I'LL EAT THAT SAID WASH 
HE CLIMBED UP AND WHILE HE WAS SLURPING FROM THE PAN 
HE REALISED THAT EVERYTHING HE HAD EVER SEEN IN HIS LIFE 
WAS PILED UP IN THE BACK YARD 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO PUT IT SAID THE WIND 
YOU DO THESE THINGS IN A MOMENT OF MADNESS AND GET LEFT WITH THE MESS 
WASH DIDN'T ANSWER BECAUSE HE WAS BUSY EATING 
I'LL CLEAR IT UP LATER SAID THE WIND GOODBYE WASH 
CIAO SAID WASH BY WHICH ITALIAN CATS MEAN GOODBYE 
THE WIND FLEW OFF AND EVERYTHING WAS STILL 
WHEN MRS. JEWEL CAME OUT WITH HER FIRST LOAD OF LAUNDRY 
SHE SAW WASH ROUND AS A BALL FAST ASLEEP ON A PAIR OF KNICKERS 
SHE SAW THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WAS IN HER BACK YARD 
WELL I'LL BE BLOWED SHE SAID 
NOW WASH AND MRS. JEWEL WERE RICH THEY HAD EVERYTHING THEY NEEDED 
BEST OF ALL MRS. JEWEL HAD A NEW SUIT OF CLOTHES 
THESE ARE FIT FOR A KING 
SHE SAID ABOUT THE VELVET BREECHES THE SILK SHIRT 
THE GOLD WAISTCOAT AND THE EMBROIDERED CLOAK 
SHE GOT THE STAINS OUT AND WHEN SHE PUT THEM ON 
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE LOOKED LIKE 
SHE LOOKED LIKE A QUEEN 
NEWS SOON SPREAD THAT THERE WAS A QUEEN COME TO NAPLES 
WHO HAD ALL THE TREASURE IN THE WORLD IN HER BACK YARD 
EVERY MORNING SHE SAT ON AN UPTURNED LAUNDRY BASKET 
AND GRACIOUSLY RECEIVED VISITORS 
TO THE RICH SHE GAVE ADVICE AND TO THE POOR SHE GAVE MONEY 
SHE HAD PLENTY OF MONEY 
BECAUSE WASH HAD FOUND THE KING'S TREASURE CHEST UNDER A BOX OF FISH 
WHAT OF THE KING OF CAPRI 
WELL HE AND EVERYBODY WHO LIVED ON THE ISLAND 
WERE AS POOR AS THE PEOPLE OF NAPLES HAD BEEN 
BEFORE THE WIND BLEW EVERYTHING ACROSS THE SEA 
THE KING HAD NOTHING TO WEAR 
BUT HIS SOCKS CROWN AND THE GARDENER'S OLD DRESSING GOWN 
ALL HIS SERVANTS AND ALL HIS FRIENDS GRADUALLY LEFT HIM 
ONE BY ONE 
TO WORK FOR THE QUEEN OF NAPLES 
SHE WAS BUILDING A PALACE IN HER BACK YARD 
SOON THE KING WAS THE ONLY PERSON LEFT ON THE ISLAND 
HE WAS LONELY AND SAD AND THIN 
HOW GLAD I AM THAT I ONLY HAVE ONE MOUTH TO FEED HE SAID TO HIMSELF 
IF I HAD TWO MOUTHS I SHOULD BE TWICE AS HUNGRY 
HE THOUGHT OF ALL THE FOOD HE'D WASTED AND THROWN AWAY 
AND OF REFUSING TO GIVE THE BEGGARS ANYTHING TO EAT 
THEN ONE DAY HE SWALLOWED HIS PRIDE 
AND ROWED ACROSS THE BAY TO SEE THE QUEEN OF NAPLES 
HOW SPLENDID EVERYTHING LOOKED ON THE GLITTERING COASTLINE 
THERE WERE MARKET STALLS SELLING FRESH BREAD 
AND PEOPLE BUILDING THINGS AND MAKING THINGS 
EVERYONE SEEMED HAPPY AND FULL 
WHEN HE ASKED THE WAY TO THE QUEEN'S HOUSE 
THEY TOLD HIM HOW GOOD AND KIND AND GENEROUS SHE WAS 
THE KING REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD EVER SAID THAT ABOUT HIM 
HE CAME TO THE MARVELLOUS PALACE 
AND THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS ORANGE CAT SITTING ON THE STEP 
IS THE QUEEN AT HOME ASKED THE KING 
SI SI SI SAID WASH BY WHICH ITALIAN CATS MEAN YES 
THE KING HEARD SINGING SO HE WENT ROUND THE BACK 
AND THERE WAS MRS. JEWEL NOW QUEEN OF NAPLES 
STANDING OVER A STEAMING TUB WASHING HER NIGHTDRESS 
HAVE YOU NO SERVANTS HE ASKED 
HUNDREDS BUT WHERE'S THE FUN IN THAT 
I USED TO HAVE SERVANTS ONCE SAID THE KING 
THEN HE LOOKED CLOSELY AT MRS. JEWEL 
I USED TO HAVE A SUIT OF CLOTHES JUST LIKE THE ONE YOU'RE WEARING 
WHAT LIKE THESE SAID THE QUEEN 
WELL MINE HAD A FEW STAINS ON THEM IT'S TRUE 
THEN THE KING TOLD THE STORY OF HOW EVERYTHING ON HIS ISLAND 
HAD BEEN BLOWN AWAY IN A TEMPEST 
WASH SHOUTED THE QUEEN 
COME HERE DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A TEMPEST 
WASH SLUNK ROUND THE CORNER 
AND HAD TO TELL THE WHOLE STORY 
ABOUT HOW THE WIND HAD DROPPED EVERYTHING FROM CAPRI 
INTO MRS. JEWEL'S BACK YARD INCLUDING THE KING'S CLOTHES 
WELL YOU'D BETTER TAKE IT ALL BACK THEN 
SAID MRS. JEWEL TO THE KING 
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU DO THEN ASKED THE KING 
OH GO BACK TO THE LAUNDRY BUSINESS I SUPPOSE SAID MRS. JEWEL 
ONLY I WOULDN'T WANT WASH TO BE HUNGRY AGAIN 
THE KING WAS SILENT FOR A WHILE 
WHILE HE WAS SILENT HE WAS LOOKING AT THE SUNSHINE AND THE FLOWERS 
AND WONDERING WHY HE NEVER LOOKED AT THEM BEFORE 
THEN HE LOOKED AT MRS. JEWEL 
AND THOUGHT SHE WAS AS LOVELY AS SUNSHINE AND FLOWERS 
AND THAT IF SHE WERE WITH HIM HE WOULD BE HAPPY AND GOOD FOR EVER 
HE SAID WHEN I WAS KING OF CAPRI 
I USED TO LONG FOR TWO MOUTHS SO THAT I COULD EAT TWICE AS MUCH FOOD 
I SHOULD LIKE TWO MOUTHS NOW 
MY OWN AND YOURS TO TALK TO ME 
MY OWN AND YOURS TO SMILE AT ME 
MY OWN AND YOURS TO KISS GOOD MORNING AND TO KISS GOOD NIGHT 
AND THE KING ASKED MRS. JEWEL TO MARRY HIM 
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE SAID 
THE KING AND MRS. JEWEL WERE MARRIED IN GREAT STYLE 
EVERYONE FROM NAPLES AND CAPRI WAS INVITED 
AND EVERYONE HAD ENOUGH TO EAT AND A PRESENT TO TAKE HOME 
THE BEST GUEST OF ALL WAS WASH'S OLD FRIEND THE WIND 
WHO BLEW EVERYBODY'S POSSESSIONS BACK TO THE RIGHT PLACE 
THE BED WENT BACK TO THE BEDROOM THE COW WENT BACK TO HER FIELD 
THE VACUUM CLEANER TO THE CUPBOARD THE BICYCLE RODE DOWN THE ROAD 
AND THE APPLES HAD BEEN EATEN THE DUCK WENT BACK TO HER POND 
THE KNICKERS BACK IN A DRAWER AND THE SOUP 
WELL THAT HAD BEEN EATEN TOO 
WASH WHO HAD EATEN IT ON THAT VERY FIRST MORNING 
WHEN THE WIND HAD MADE MRS. JEWEL A QUEEN 
LICKED HIS LIPS AND LAY ON THE WALL 
HIS FUR AS ORANGE AS THE SUN 
AND HIS EYES LIKE TWO GOLD COINS 
BYE FOR NOW
