WHARGH 
WHOO ARGH 
WHARGH 
WHEE 
WHOA 
HA HA 
WINKIE'S THE NAME 
WEE WILLY 
I'VE RUN THROUGH THE STREETS FOR YEARS 
UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS IN MY NIGHTGOWN CHECKING EVERYONE WAS SAFE IN BED 
EVERYONE IN BED YES WILLY 
THERE'D NEVER BEEN A PROBLEM BEFORE BUT TONIGHT SOMETHING WAS DIFFERENT 
I SET OFF THROUGH THE STREETS AS USUAL 
IT SEEMED A PERFECTLY ORDINARY NIGHT 
AS I TURNED FROM MAIN STREET INTO AN UNLIT ALLEY THE WORLD WENT BLACK 
ARGH 
I LAY IN THE DARKNESS WONDERING WHAT HAD GONE WRONG 
WAS IT SOMETHING I'D DONE EARLIER 
THAT AFTERNOON I'D DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
I WAS BORED WITH THE NIGHTGOWN AND CANDLE 
THAT OUTFIT WAS GETTING STALE NO ONE NOTICED ME 
I MERGED INTO THE NIGHT 
I NEEDED TO MAKE MY MARK AND WHAT BETTER THAN SOME NEW GEAR 
LITTLE DID I KNOW WHAT DISASTER LAY IN STORE 
I DECIDED TO COMPARE SOME OUTFITS BUT NOTHING SEEMED TO BE RIGHT 
THE LAMPS AND TORCHES WERE HEAVY AND CLUMSY 
THE CLOTHES DRAB AND BORING I NEEDED TO SEE IN THE DARK 
AND AS I STOOD THERE LOOKING IT CAME TO ME 
THE BRIGHT YELLOW JACKET WITH REFLECTIVE STRIPS 
OF COURSE IT STOOD OUT 
I LOOKED OUTSIDE IT WAS GETTING DARK NO TIME TO LOSE 
I THREW ON THE JACKET I GLANCED AT THE CANDLE 
I DIDN'T NEED IT NOW IT WAS HISTORY 
I STEPPED OUTSIDE 
I SET OFF THROUGH THE STREETS AS USUAL 
IT SEEMED A PERFECTLY ORDINARY NIGHT 
AS I TURNED FROM MAIN STREET INTO AN UNLIT ALLEY THE WORLD WENT BLACK 
ARGH 
I LAY IN THE DARKNESS WONDERING WHAT HAD GONE WRONG 
WAS IT SOMETHING I'D DONE EARLIER 
ON A PLANE THE SAFETY OF PASSENGERS IS IN THE HANDS OF THE PILOT 
BUT FOR EVERY PILOT THERE'LL ALWAYS BE A FIRST TIME 
HOW CAN THEY PRACTISE THEIR FLYING SKILLS SAFELY 
THE ANSWER IS IN THIS MACHINE IT'S CALLED A FLIGHT SIMULATOR 
INSIDE IT'S EXACTLY LIKE THE COCKPIT OF A REAL PLANE 
TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE REALISTIC IT MOVES 
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MUCH BUT IN THE MACHINE 
YOU'D FEEL EXACTLY LIKE YOU WOULD IN A REAL PLANE 
ENGINE LIKE HUM 
PILOTS USE SIMULATORS TO PRACTISE FLYING 
AND TO HELP THEM FEEL LIKE THEY'RE IN A REAL AEROPLANE 
THERE ARE FALSE WINDOWS TO SHOW WHAT IT'D LOOK LIKE FROM THE COCKPIT 
VICKY WORKS FOR A COMPANY THAT MAKES THESE IMAGES 
WHAT WE DO IS GO OUT TO THE REAL AIRPORT 
WE TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS PAYING ATTENTION TO THE COLOURS AND THE SHAPES 
WE GET MAPS AND PLANS WE PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER 
AND BUILD THE MODEL AS IT IS IN THE REAL WORLD 
WE SCAN THEM INTO THE COMPUTER AND PUT THEM 
ON THE SIDES OF THE BUILDING SO IT LOOKS EVEN MORE REALISTIC 
AND WE CAN SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ON THE MODEL 
IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO FINISH A WHOLE AIRPORT BUT WHEN IT'S DONE 
IT'S REALLY WORTH IT AND IT LOOKS JUST LIKE IT DOES IN THE REAL WORLD 
PILOTS HAVE TO LEARN TO FLY IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES DURING THE DAY 
AND AT NIGHT AT NIGHT EVERYTHING LOOKS DIFFERENT 
DURING THE DAY IT'S LIGHT SO YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING 
WHEN IT GOES DARK AT NIGHT 
WE DEPEND ON ALL THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS TO SEE 
VICKY HAS TO IDENTIFY ALL THE LIGHT SOURCES SO THAT SHE CAN CREATE 
A PICTURE OF THE SCENE AT NIGHT 
TO CREATE A NIGHT SCENE WE DON'T TAKE PHOTOS 
WE LOOK AT THE MODEL AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE SEE AT NIGHT 
THIS IS FRANKFURT GERMANY DURING THE DAY 
FIRST THERE'S THE RUNWAY LIGHTS THEY'RE ALWAYS ON 
AT NIGHT THEY'RE EVEN BRIGHTER 
THEN I MUST THINK ABOUT WHAT ELSE YOU CAN SEE AT NIGHT 
THESE BUILDINGS WOULD HAVE LIGHTS ON INSIDE 
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THROUGH THE WINDOWS 
NOW I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT OTHER LIGHT SOURCES THERE ARE 
THERE ARE LAMP POSTS IN FRONT OF THESE BUILDINGS 
AND FLOODLIGHTS ON THESE THESE'LL LIGHT UP THE TARMAC HERE 
THE FOREST HAS NO LIGHT THAT STAYS DARK 
THE ROADS ARE LIT BY LAMP POSTS SO THEY APPEAR ORANGE 
THERE ARE CARS MOVING UP AND DOWN THIS ROAD 
SO YOU CAN SEE THEIR HEADLIGHTS 
AND FINALLY WE CAN SEE THE STARS IN THE SKY 
NOW LET'S LAND AT THE AIRPORT 
THE COUNTRYSIDE'S DARK BUT THE BUILDINGS AND AEROPLANES ARE LIT UP 
AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE GROUND 
WE CAN SEE THE PLANE'S HEADLIGHTS LIGHTING THE RUNWAY 
THAT'S IT WE'VE LANDED 
REALISTIC ISN'T IT 
ONCE WE'RE HAPPY WITH THE PICTURE IT GOES TO FLIGHT SIMULATORS 
AND PILOTS CAN TRAIN ON IT JUST LIKE A REAL PLANE 
I ENJOY MY JOB AND IT IS IMPORTANT 
IF WE MADE A MISTAKE THE PILOTS COULDN'T TRAIN PROPERLY 
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN TO DO VICKY'S JOB 
HAVE A LOOK AT THESE PICTURES WHAT WOULD YOU SEE AT NIGHT 
MY FAVOURITE SUBJECT IS MATHS ENGLISH 
GEOGRAPHY SCIENCE 
ART LANGUAGE HISTORY 
MY FAVOURITE SUBJECT IS 
SCIENCE 
I LIKE LEARNING SCIENCE YOU DO ALL THESE DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS 
SCIENCE DEFINITELY SCIENCE 
MIGHT LIKE TO BE A DOCTOR 
I MIGHT BE A SCIENTIST WHEN I GROW UP 
THEY'RE LIKE MAD PROFESSORS ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL 
I WANNA GO TO THE MOON 
HOW DOES GRASS GROW 
PLANTS AND POLLINATION 
SEED DISPERSAL WE MADE A VOLCANO 
LEARNING TO BLOW THINGS UP AND MAKE THINGS 
IT EXPLODED ALL OVER THE PLACE 
I USED TO ENJOY DISSECTING MICE 
MY INTEREST WAS THE HUMAN BODY 
I'VE GOT TWO HUNDRED BONES IN MY BODY 
THE SKELETON AND THE SKIN 
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE TEETH DID SO MUCH 
MOLARS FOR GRINDING 
INCISORS 
E. EQUALS M. C. TWO 
WE'RE DOING FORCES 
WE'VE BEEN DOING GRAVITY 
PUSHING A BALLOON INTO THE WATER AND FEELING WHAT THE FORCE WAS LIKE 
I'D ASK ISAAC NEWTON DID IT HURT WHEN THE APPLE FELL ON YOUR HEAD 
IT KEEPS YOU DOWN INSTEAD OF FLOATING AROUND IN THE SKY 
I DON'T REALLY LIKE THE BIG BANG THEORY 
I LIKE THE FACT WE'RE TINY COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE UNIVERSE
