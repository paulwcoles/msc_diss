THIS IS B. B. C. WORLD NEWS TODAY WITH 
ME ZEINAB BADAWI IS SOUTH AFRICA 
DOING ALL IT CAN TO HELP EASE THE 
CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE WE TALK TO THE 
MAN TIPPED TO BECOME THE COUNTRY'S 
NEXT PRESIDENT JACOB ZUMA 
AS AFRICAN NATIONS TURN AWAY A 
CHINESE CARGO SHIP CARRYING ARMS 
FOR ZIMBABWE WE ASK HIM WHY HE 
DOESN'T BACK BRITAIN'S CALL FOR A 
FULL ARMS EMBARGO 
IF WE BEGIN TO SHOUT THAT FROM HERE 
IN LONDON TO THE AFRICAN STATES 
IT'S ALMOST TELLING THE AFRICAN 
STATES WHAT TO DO WHAT NOT TO DO 
THE UN RELIEF AGENCY IN GAZA 
SUSPENDS AID DISTRIBUTION BECAUSE 
IT LACKS FUEL AND WARNS HOSPITALS 
MAY RUN OUT IN A WEEK IS FUEL 
BEING USED AS A POLITICAL TOOL IN 
THE CONFLICT 
A SIGN OF THE CHANGING TIMES IN 
CUBA ORIDNARY PEOPLE CAN BUY D. V. D. 
PLAYERS AND MOBILE PHONES AS RAUL 
CASTRO LOOSENS RESTRICTIONS 
HELLO JACOB ZUMA THE PRESIDENT OF 
SOUTH AFRICA'S RULING PARTY THE 
AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS HAS TOLD 
THIS PROGRAMME AT THE WEEKEND OF 
THE ELECTION IN ZIMBABWE LACKS 
CREDIBILITY AND THAT THE ONLY WAY 
FORWARD NOW IS DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE 
TWO SIDES HIS INTERVIEW WITH US 
COMES ON A DAY WHEN A CHINESE CARGO 
SHIP CARRYING GUNS AND AMMUNITION 
TO ZIMBABWE IS REPORTEDLY HEADING 
BACK TO CHINA AFTER BEING REFUSED 
ENTRY BY SOUTHERN AFRICAN COUNTRIES 
IT IS A RARE REBUKE FROM THE REGION 
TO PRESIDENT MUGABE AND IT 
REFLECTS CONCERN THAT WEAPONS COULD 
ESCALATE TENSIONS IN ZIMBABWE 
FOLLOWING THE DISPUTE OVER THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION LAST MONTH 
NO WHERE TO GO BUT HOME IT SEEMS 
FOR THE CHINESE VESSEL THAT FOR 
DAYS HAS BEEN TRYING TO DOCK IN 
SOUTHERN AFRICA IT'S AN 
EMBARRASSMENT FOR THE CHINESE WHO 
MIGHT WISH TO PLAY DOWN THEIR TIES 
WITH ZIMBABWE GIVEN ALL THE FLAK 
THEY'RE GETTING OVER THE OLYMPIC 
GAMES AND TIBET 
IT WAS DOCK WORKERS AT THE SOUTH 
AFRICAN PORT OF DURBAN WHO TOOK THE 
FIRST STAND AGAINST ROBERT MUGABE 
AND REFUSED TO UNLOAD THE CARGO 
AND SOUTH AFRICA'S HIGH COURT 
REFUSED TO ALLOW THE WEAPONS TO BE 
TRANSPORTED TO LANDLOCKED ZIMBABWE 
THE AN YUE JIANG IS REPORTEDLY 
CARRYING THREE MILLION ROUNDS OF RIFLE 
AMMUNITION THREE THOUSAND MORTAR ROUNDS AND 
FIFTEEN ROCKET PROPELLED GRENADES THE 
ARMS SHIPMENT WOULD BE LIKE 
LIGHTING THE FUSE OF A POWDER KEG 
SAID ZIMABWE'S OPPOSITON 
THESE ARE PICTURES RELEASED BY 
HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS OF 
OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS IN ZIMBABWE 
WHO'VE APPARENTLY BEEN BEATEN BY 
GANGS LOYAL TO THE RULING PARTY 
ZANU P. F. 
IN BRITAIN THE PRIME MINISTER 
GORDON BROWN HAS PROPOSED AN ARMS 
EMBARGO IN ZIMBABWE 
HIS CALL WAS TODAY BACKED BY THE 
ANGLICAN CHURCH'S MOST SENIOR 
FIGURES 
I SUPPORT EVERY EFFORT AT FIGURES STOPPING ANY ARMS GOING TO ZIMBABWE 
I COMMEND THE TRADE UNION THAT 
STARTED IT ALL 
BUT AFRICAN LEADERS WHO'VE HELD 
EMERGENCY MEETINGS ABOUT ZIMABWE 
HAVE MUFFLED THEIR CRITICISMS OF 
PRESIDENT MUGABE THEY'VE CALLED ON 
ZIMBABWE'S ELECTORAL COMMISSION TO 
RELEASE THE ORIGINAL RESULTS OF THE 
DISPUTED GENERAL ELECTION HELD LAST 
MONTH THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE INSISTS IT WON 
AND HAS CONDEMNED THE RE COUNT 
CURRENTLY BEING UNDERTAKEN BY THE 
AUTHORITIES AUTHORITIES NINETY SEVEN NINETY EIGHT 
TODAY AMERICA'S STATE 
DEPARTMENT BOOSTED THE M. D. C. BY 
STATING THEY WERE THE CLEAR VICTORS 
HOWEVER TODAY IN MOZAMBIQUE THE 
M. D. C. LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
STRUCK A MORE CONCILIATORY NOTE WE WE ARE SEEKING AFRICAN SOLUTIONS TO 
AFRICAN PROBLEMS AND I AM SURE 
THAT THE PRESIDENT AND OTHER 
LEADERS CONCUR WITH THE APPROACH 
THAT WE MUST HAVE ONGOING 
DIALOGUE DIALOGUE CERTAINLY A NEGOTIATED PEACEFUL 
SOLUTION INVOLVING BOTH SIDES IN 
ZIMBABWE IS THE REGION'S PREFERRED 
OPTION OUT OF THE CURRENT CRISIS 
ZIMBABWEANS HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED 
TOO MUCH AND WHILST MANY WISH FOR 
AN END TO MUGABE'S RULE THEY ALSO 
WANT TO AVOID FURTHER BLOODSHED 
I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO THE NEW 
LEADER OF SOUTH AFRICA'S RULING 
PARTY THE A. N. C. JACOB ZUMA HE HAS 
WARNED OF A DEEPENING CRISIS IN 
ZIMBABWE IN CONTRAST TO THE MORE 
MEASURED TONES OF PRESIDENT MBEKI 
WHO HAS CONSISTENTLY ATTRACTED 
CRITICISMS FOR NOT SPEAKING OUT 
MORE PUBLICLY AGAINST THE 
INCREASINGLY AUTHORITARIAN NATURE 
OF ROBERT MUGABE I CAUGHT UP WITH 
JACOB ZUMA WHO IS ON A VISIT TO 
LONDON EARLIER TODAY AND ASKED 
HIM IF HE BELIEVES SOUTH AFRICA IS 
DOING ALL IT CAN TO HELP RESOLVE 
THE CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE 
DEFINITELY SOUTH AFRICA HAS TRIED 
ITS LEVEL BEST TO DO WHATEVER IT 
CAN TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS IN SOME 
BOBBLY TO PARTICIPATE WITH THE 
ZIMBABWEANS FROM THE BEGINNING 
WHEN THE CRISIS STARTED IN ZIMBABWE 
WE DECIDED VERY DELIBERATELY IN 
ZIMBABWE TO ENGAGE THE 
ZIMBABWEANS ON BOTH SIDES ZANU P. F. 
AND M. D. C. TO DISCUSS WITH THEM TO 
RESOLVE THE PROBLEM WE DECIDED 
VERY DELIBERATELY THAT WE WERE NOT 
GOING TO STAND ON THE ROOFTOPS AND 
CRITICISE ZIMBABWE BECAUSE THAT 
WOULD HAVE UNDERMINED OUR EFFORT OF 
ENGAGING WITH THE ZIMBABWEANS ON 
BOTH SIDES BECAUSE IT WOULD EITHER 
MAKE THEM FEEL ANGRY ABOUT WHAT WE 
SAY AND THEREFORE NOT BE READY FOR 
US TO LISTEN AND WE BELIEVE THAT 
OUR APPROACH IS IN FACT THE 
APPROACH THAT HAS DONE SOMETHING 
THAN OTHER APPROACHES THAT HAVE 
BEEN MADE THERE WE HAVE NOT BEEN 
WORRIED ABOUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY 
WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD JUST DO THAT 
AND WE DID SO 
WE UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGE FROM 
AFRICAN LEADERS LIKE YOURSELF THAT 
YOU ALL SAY WE CANNOT CONDEMN ALL 
THE TIME TRUST US WE ARE DOING 
THINGS BEHIND THE SCENES CAN YOU 
GIVE US YOUR ASSURANCES THAT BEHIND 
THE SCENES THERE IS MORE ACTIVITY 
DIPLOMATICALLY THAN PERHAPS WE ARE 
AWARE OF 
DEFINITELY FROM SOUTH 
AFRICA IN PARTICULAR BUT CLEARLY 
AT THE TIME WHEN THE PROBLEM WAS 
JUST STARTING THE ENERGY ON BOTH 
SIDES WAS STILL VERY STRONG WE 
COULD NOT SUCCEED THEM WE ALSO 
PARTICIPATED IN MEDIATING THE 
DRAFTING OF A CONSTITUTION AND 
THIS WAS ALMOST COMPLETED IT WAS 
AT ONE POINT ONLY LEFT TO BE SIGNED 
IT WAS NOT SIGNED BECAUSE OF LAPSES 
BETWEEN THE TWO 
BUT DO YOU NOT 
THINK EVENTS ON THE GROUND HAVE 
OVERTAKEN THIS WE HAVE GOT CHURCH 
LEADERS AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS 
IN ZIMBABWE CALLING FOR IMMEDIATE 
INTERVENTION FROM THE AFRICANS AND 
FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE 
PERHAPS HAVE LOST PATIENCE WITH 
THIS SOFTLY SOFTLY APPROACH THERE THERE IS NO OTHER APPROACH EXCEPT OUR 
APPROACH THAT I KNOW OF 
WHAT ABOUT 
THE ARMS EMBARGO WHICH GORDON 
BROWN HAS CALLED FOR FOR EXAMPLE 
I AM NOT CERTAIN ABOUT THAT 
WHETHER YOU NEED TO COME TO AN ARMS 
EMBARGO RIGHT NOW AND THEN SAY WE 
NEED AN ARMS EMBARGO A THINK WHAT 
HAS HAPPENED TO THE SHIP THAT CAME 
TOWARDS DUBLIN HOLDER FROM THE 
AFRICAN WORKERS DOWN THERE I THINK 
IT HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT INDICATION 
THAT HAS BEEN MADE BY THE PEOPLE 
DOWN THERE IF YOU GO TO THE ARMS 
EMBARGO AND PARTICULARLY IF YOU 
JUST CALL FOR IT AT THIS POINT IN 
TIME ER I THINK WE'RE GOING TO 
HAVE DIFFICULTIES TO CONVINCE 
PEOPLE BECAUSE IN ZIMBABWE RIGHT 
NOW EVERY COUNTRY HAS A RIGHT TO 
TRADE IN WHATEVER WAY THERE HAS 
BEEN A VERY SPECIFIC ATTITUDE 
TOWARDS THIS ONE PRECISELY BECAUSE 
OF THE SITUATION CURRENTLY TAKING 
PLACE I THINK IF YOU MOVE TO THAT 
LEVEL I THINK IT JUST GETS A 
LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT BUT ONE OF 
THE THINGS THAT I MUST SAY YOU SEE 
IF WE BEGIN TO SHOUT THAT FROM HERE 
IN LONDON TO THE AFRICAN STATES 
IT'S ALMOST TELLING THE AFRICAN 
STATES WHAT TO DO WHAT NOT TO DO 
I THINK THAT APPROACH IN ITSELF 
MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT 
WHAT ABOUT A GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL 
UNITY IN ZIMBABWE IMMEDIATELY 
AFTER THE CONTESTED ELECTION WE 
UNDERSTAND MORGAN TSVANGIRAI OF THE 
OPPOSITION M. D. C. SAID THAT IS 
SOMETHING HE WOULD HAVE AGREED TO 
ZANU P. F. OFFICIALS HAD MEETINGS WITH 
HIS PEOPLE TOO HIS SOUTH AFRICA 
PERHAPS NOT INTERESTED IN SEEING A 
PEACEFUL RESOLUTION IN ZIMBABWE SO 
WOULD YOU BACK A GOVERNMENT OF 
NATIONAL UNITY 
WE CERTAINLY ARE 
KEEN TO SEE A RESOLUTION OF THE 
PROBLEM BECAUSE IT IS A PROBLEM 
NOW WHICH IS SPILLING OVER TO 
VIOLENCE THAT KIND OF PROPOSAL 
IT COULD BE ONE OPTION AMONG MANY 
HOW THEN DO YOU COME OUT OF THE 
SITUATION PARTICULARLY IF THE 
ZIMBABWEANS THEMSELVES ARE 
RECEPTIVE TO THAT PROPOSAL AND ARE 
PREPARED TO DISCUSS IT I THINK IT 
SHOULD BE WELCOMED YOU THAT ONE OF 
THE OPTIONS THAT SOUTH AFRICA IS 
WORKING FOR BEHIND THE SCENES THE 
GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY NOT 
NECESSARILY WE HAVE NOT BEEN 
WORKING FOR IT I AM JUST SAYING 
THAT SINCE THE PROPOSAL IS BEING 
MADE WE ALL NEED TO LOOK AT IT MY 
VIEW IS THAT THE TWO PARTIES MUST 
BE MADE TO TALK AND IF YOU ARE 
SAYING BOTH OF THEM ARE NOT AVERSE 
TO THIS PROPOSAL THEN I THINK THAT 
GIVES A BETTER POSSIBILITY FOR 
PEOPLE TO DISCUSS BECAUSE THESE 
ELECTIONS WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR 
NOT THEY HAVE BEEN DISCREDITED IN 
THE MANNER IN WHICH THE ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION HAS HANDLED IT AND 
THEREFORE ANY RESULT WHICH COMES 
NOW IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT FOR 
PEOPLE TO SAY THEY ARE LEGITIMATE 
AND THEREFORE YOU NEED TO FIND A 
WAY FOR THE ZIMBABWEANS TO SAY HOW 
DO WE GO FORWARD FROM HERE AND I 
THINK THAT KIND OF SITUATION IF 
THEY ACCEPT IT I THINK IT IS A 
KIND OF PROPOSAL WE NEED TO GIVE A 
CHANCE 
SO THEREFORE THE ZIMBABWE CHANCE ELECTORAL COMMISSION WHICH IS AT 
PRESENT ENGAGED IN A RECOUNT 
PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT WILL JUST 
GIVE THEM THE CHANCE TO COOK UP THE 
KIND OF RESULT WHICH SUITS ZANU P. F. 
ARE YOU SAYING THIS IS A WASTE OF 
TIME BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE NOT 
BELIEVE IT ANYWAY 
HOW CAN IT BE 
DISCREDITED AND HOW CAN THEY STILL 
CONTINUE HOW CAN THEY SAY I AM NOW 
RECOUNTING WHAT I HAVE COUNTED 
BEFORE I THINK IT IS JUST A 
PROBLEM IT'S NOT GOING TO RESOLVE 
ANY PROBLEM BECAUSE ELECTIONS ARE 
VERY SENSITIVE THINGS TO ANYBODY 
PARTIES SEND THEIR PARTY AGENTS 
WHO MUST LOOK AT THE BALLOT BOX IT 
MUST NOT LEAVE THE EYES IT MUST 
NOT EVEN GO BEHIND THE DOOR IF 
THEY HAVE BEEN LOCKED SOMEWHERE YOU 
DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING 
HOW DO YOU COME BACK AND SAY THIS 
IS WHAT THEY WERE IT'S A VERY 
DIFFICULT THING TO DO 
YOU ONCE 
SAID NO LEADER SHOULD STAY IN POWER 
FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS BY THAT 
RECKONING ROBERT MUGABE HAS WELL 
OUTSTAYED HIS WELCOME DO YOU FEEL 
THAT WE ARE IN THE END GAME NOW AS 
FAR AS PRESIDENT MUGABE IS 
CONCERNED AND THAT THE SANDS ARE 
SHIFTING INTERNALLY AS WELL AS 
EXTERNALLY 
I WOULD NOT WANT TO EXTERNALLY JUDGE THE ZIMBABWE SITUATION AND 
OTHER LEADERS BUT DEFINITELY I 
HAVE MADE THE POINT IN GENERAL 
NOT NECESSARILY REFERRING TO MUGABE 
GENERALLY TO SAY STAYING BEYOND TEN 
YEARS IN POWER IN MY VIEW IS NOT 
RIGHT PEOPLE BEGIN TO PERSONALISE 
THINGS IDENTIFY THINGS WITH 
THEMSELVES AND I THINK TEN YEARS IS 
ENOUGH THAT'S A GENERAL POINT NOT 
BECAUSE I AM AIMING AT A PARTICULAR 
INDIVIDUAL 
LOOKING AT YOUR FUTURE INDIVIDUAL YOU WERE ELECTED LEADER OF THE A. N. C. 
YOU ARE IN POLE POSITION TO SUCCEED 
PRESIDENT MBEKI AS PRESIDENT IN 
SOUTH AFRICA IN ABOUT A YEAR'S TIME 
ARE YOU UP TO THE JOB THE BURDEN 
OF EXPECTATIONS MUST BE VERY GREAT 
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT YOU TO 
ALLEVIATE THE TERRIBLE POVERTY THAT 
STILL AFFLICTS SOUTH AFRICANS 
CERTAINLY IF THE A. N. C. GAVE ME THAT 
TASK I AM READY TO ADDRESS THOSE 
ISSUES BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE 
CONCERNS OF THE A. N. C. TO ALLEVIATE 
POVERTY FROM OUR PEOPLE IF I AM 
GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY I WILL WORK 
TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO ENSURE THAT THE A. N. C. 
SUCCEEDS IN THAT TASK 
BUT YOU'RE 
IN A DIFFICULT POSITION BECAUSE YOU 
WERE HERE ON A TOUR OF EUROPE TO 
REASSURE INVESTORS THAT YOUR 
BUSINESS FRIENDLY PEOPLE ARE 
LOOKING AT YOUR LEFT OF CENTRE 
CREDENTIALS AND YET THE TRADE 
UNIONISTS AND THE COMMUNISTS BACK 
YOU IN SOUTH AFRICA ARE YOU BEING 
PULLED AND TWO DIFFERENT 
DIRECTIONS 
NOT AT ALL THERE IS NO DIRECTIONS CONTRADICTION AND ALSO THERE IS 
NOTHING NEW THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF 
THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA WHICH 
IS DEMOCRATIC NELSON MANDELA WAS 
ELECTED INTO THE POSITION WITH THE 
SUPPORT OF THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT 
AND THE SOUTH AFRICAN COMMUNIST 
PARTY AS WELL AS MBEKI SO THERE 
IS NOTHING THAT IS NEW FOR ME 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING BECAUSE 
JACOB ZUMA IS SUPPORTED BY THESE 
HE IS GOING TO MOVE TOO FAR TO THE 
LEFT BUT THERE IS NOTHING NEW 
DO YOU HAVE THE AGENCY BEHIND YOU 
WE SAW THAT THE CONTEST TO LEAD THE 
PARTY WAS A FAIRLY FRACTIOUS ONE 
DO WE NOT HAVE A STRUGGLE FOR THE 
SOUL OF THE A. N. C. BETWEEN YOUR 
SUPPORTERS AND THOSE WHO BACKED 
MBEKI 
NOT AT ALL THE A. N. C. IS MBEKI UNITED THAT WAS AN ACT OF 
DEMOCRACY WHICH IS AN EVENT THAT 
MUST HAPPEN ONCE IT HAPPENS NOT 
FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM TIME 
IMMEMORIAL OF THE CONFERENCE WE 
UNITE BEHIND THE NEW LEADERSHIP 
YOU DO NOT HAVE TOO MANY ENEMIES TO 
BE A REAL UNIFIER AND HEALER IN 
SOUTH AFRICA NOT AT ALL 
AT ALL 
DOES IT MAKE ANY SENSE THAN TO HAVE 
YOUR SIGNATURE TUNE BRING ME MY 
MACHINE GUN SHOULD YOU HAVE A 
SONG WHICH IS MORE CONCILIATORY 
MORE CALM 
THAT SONG IS A STRUGGLE 
SONG IT IS PART OF HISTORY IT IS 
JUST LIKE YOU READING A BOOK ABOUT 
HISTORY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED YOU 
CAN'T SAY BECAUSE WE ARE NOW IN 
PEACETIME WE MUST ERASE CHAPTERS 
IN THE BOOK THIS HAS A SONG LIKE 
ANY SONG THAT IS BEING SUNG IT 
DOES NOT MEAN WE ARE SAYING THAT 
SITUATION SHOULD COME NOW IT IS A 
FREEDOM SONG I WILL NEVER FORGET 
THAT I WAS ONCE A FREEDOM FIGHTER 
I WAS ONCE A SOLDIER AND IF ONE 
DAY I SING A SONG OF A SOLDIER IT 
DOESN'T MEAN I AM SAYING LET 
THERE BE WORN NOW I AM THINKING 
ABOUT MY PAST WHICH I WILL NEVER 
ERASE IN MY MIND 
NOW THE UN RELIEF AGENCY IN GAZA 
HAS STOPPED DISTRIBUTING AID TO 
PEOPLE THERE BECAUSE OF AN ACUTE 
SHORTAGE OF FUEL FOR ITS VEHICLES 
IT'S ESTIMATED ZERO PER CENT OF GAZA IANS ARE 
DEPENDANT ON THAT MANY OF THEM 
CHILDREN ISRAEL MAINTENANCE THAT 
HAMAS IS DELIBERATELY PREVENTING 
FUEL FROM BEING DISTRIBUTED THE UN 
HAS DENOUNCED THE USE OF FUEL FOR 
POLITICAL PURPOSES 
HAS DENOUNCED THE USE OF FUEL FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES 
SINCE ISRAELI SANCTIONS ON GAZA 
BEGAN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
DEPENDANT ON FOOD AID DELIVERS HAS 
RISEN SHARPLY IT'S THOUGHT TO BE 
OH EIGHT PER CENT A POPULATION WITH A HIGH 
PROPORTION OF CHILDREN NOW THE UN 
SAYS FUEL SHORTAGES IN GAZA MEAN 
IT'S OPERATIONS WILL BE SERIOUSLY 
AFFECTED 
WE'LL HAVE TO START OUR AFFECTED MAJOR FOOD OPERATION HERE WHICH IS 
FEEDING ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND REFUGEES 
THAT'S THE FIRST AND MOST IMMEDIATE 
CONSEQUENCE OF THE CUT OFF OF FUEL 
TO THE GAZA STRIP WE HAVE NOT 
RECEIVED ANY FUEL AT THE UN SINCE 
APRIL FIRST FLUEL ISRAEL STARTED TO 
DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF FUEL IT 
ALLOWED INTO GAZA LAST SUMMER AS 
PART OF A PLAN TO PUT PRESSURE ON 
HAMAS AND PALESTINIAN MILITANTS WHO 
FIRE ROCKETS ACROSS THE BORDER IN 
PROTEST GAZA'S PETROL STATIONS 
BACKED BY HAMAS HAVE BEEN STAGING A 
STRIKE 
ISRAEL SAYS IT HAS SUPPLIED STRIKE MORE THAN ONE MILLION LITRES OF 
FUEL THAT HAVE NOT BEEN USED THIS THIS FUEL IS CURRENTLY WAITING TO BE 
PICKED UP BY THE PALESTINIANS FOR 
THEIR OWN USE IT IS THE HAMAS 
DENYING THE PALESTINIANS ACCESS TO 
THE FUEL USING IT CYNICALLY TO 
DEPRIVE THEIR OWN CITIZENS OF THE 
BASIC HUMANITARIAN NEED 
NOW THERE 
ARE FEWER CARS THAN NORMAL ON THE 
STREETS OF THE GAZA CITY AND THE 
PETROL STATIONS SAY THEY WILL ONLY 
ACCEPT FUEL WHEN ISRAEL ALLOWS MORE 
IN 
PEOPLE ARE HAVING 
TO GO BACK TO PRIMITIVE TRANSPORT 
HORSES AND DONKEYS HAVE REPLACED 
NORMAL TRANSPORT 
THE EFFECTS ARE 
WIDER TENS OF THOUSANDS OF GAZANS 
RELY ON THE FISHING TRADE FOR 
INCOME NOW ALMOST ALL FISHING HAS 
STOPPED BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH 
FUEL TO TAKE THE BOATS OUT A 
RECENT MILITANT ATTACK ON GAZA'S 
MAIN FUEL DETERMINE KNELL DEEPENED 
THE CRISIS WHILE THE UN CONDEMNED 
THE ATTACK IT SAYS SUFFERING WILL 
ONLY BE EASED IF ISRAEL LIFTS ITS 
BLOCKADE BE BLOCKADE 
THE C. I. A. IS SAID TO HAVE PICTURES 
PROVING THAT NORTH KOREANS WERE 
WORKING INSIDE A SECRET SYRIAN 
NUCLEAR NUCLEAR HERE IN THE U. K. A VIDEO SHOWING 
MOHAMED KHAN HAS BEEN SHOWING TO A 
JURY THE TAPE WAS PLAYED IN THE 
TRIAL OF THREE MEN WHO DENY HELPING 
TO IDENTIFY TARGETS FOR THE ATTACKS 
NEARLY THREE YEARS AGO 
THAT VIDEO WAS SHOWN IN COURT 
IN PAKISTAN A PROTALIBAN TRIBAL 
LEADERS HAS TOLD HIS SUPPORTERS TO 
STOP ATTACKS AND THEY WILL FACE 
PUNISHMENTS IF THEY DON'T IT'S 
REPORTED THAT ALEEM MAQBOOL IS 
CLOSE TO A PEACE DEAL WITH 
PAKISTAN'S GOVERNMENT 
IT'S ONE SINCE HE WON THE FRENCH 
PRESIDENCY AND NICOLAS SARKOZY HAS 
TAKEN A HAMMERING IN THE POLLS 
RATED IT IS THE MOST UNPOPULAR 
PRESIDENT FOR HALF A CENTURY HE'S 
TONIGHT TRYING TO WIN BACK HIS 
REPUTATION AS A REFORMING MAN OF 
ACTION WITH A ZERO MINUTE INTERVIEW 
LIVE ON FRENCH T. V. WHICH YOU'RE 
LOOKING AT NOW NINETY MINUTE IT 
KICKED OFF ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AGO 
NOW IT'S TWO MONTHS SINCE CUBA'S 
RAUL CASTRO OFFICIALLY TOOK OVER 
THE COUNTRY'S LEADERSHIP FROM HIS 
AILING OLDER BROTHER HE HAS LIFTED 
A RANGE OF RESTRICTIONS ON CUBANS 
FROM OWNING MOBILE PHONES AND 
COMPUTERS TO STAYING IN THE SAME 
HOTEL AS FOREIGNERS THERE ARE 
ECONOMIC CHANGES UNDER WAY 
PARTICULARLY IN AGRICULTURE 
THERE'S NO SIGN OF POLITICAL REFORM 
AND WASHINGTON HAS DISMISSED THE 
CHANGES AS COSMETIC THERE ARE 
EXPECTATIONS THAT FURTHER ECONOMIC 
REFORMS COULD BE ON THE WAY 
THERE ARE CHANGES UNDER WAY IN THE 
CUBAN COUNTRYSIDE THE FIRST SHOOTS 
PERHAPS OF A NEW AGRIAN REFORM FOR 
YEARS THE COMMUNIST AUTHORITIES 
HAVE TOLERATED SMALL FAMILY RUN 
FARMS AND PRIVATE CO OPERATIVES 
THEY PRODUCE MORE THAN HALF THE 
COUNTRY'S FOOD ON A FIFTH OF THE 
ARABLE LAND 
WE PUT 
MORE EFFORT IN WE HAVE THE 
MOTIVATION TO PRODUCE MORE THIS 
MAN TOLD ME 
NOW PRIVATE SECTOR 
FARMERS ARE BEING ACTIVELY 
ENCOURAGED TO EXPAND BY TAKING OVER 
UNUSED OR UNPRODUCTIVE STATE OWNED 
LAND THERE WILL BE LESS 
CENTRALISED CONTROL OVER WHAT TO 
PLANT AND BETTER ACCESS TO SUPPLIES 
THERE'S REALLY BIG CHANGES TAKING PLACE ALL SORTS OF 
THINGS HAVE GOT BETTER FOR FARMERS 
LIKE US WE HAVE BEEN OFFERED A BIT 
MORE LAND AND RESOURCES LIKE 
FERTILIZERS AND PESTICIDES THEY 
HAVE PRODUCED WATER AND ELECTRICAL 
SUPPLIES 
TACKLING RURAL POVERTY SUPPLIES WAS AT THE HEART OF FIDEL CASTRO'S 
REVOLUTION ONE OF HIS FIRST MAJOR 
ACTS WAS TO NATIONALISE THE BIG 
LAND HOLDINGS MANY AMERICAN OWNED 
LIKE THE SOVIET UNION HE WENT MORE 
LARGE STATE OWNED FARMS WHERE ALL 
DECISION MAKING IS CENTRALLY 
CONTROLLED CUBA HAS ENOUGH FERTILE 
LAND TO BE ALMOST SELF SUFFICIENT 
IN FOOD INSTEAD THE STATE SYSTEM 
HAS PROVED SO INEFFICIENT IT SPENDS 
ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON IMPORTS 
THESE LATEST MOVES ARE MODEST 
TENTATIVE STEPS GOVERNMENT 
ECONOMISTS BELIEVE IF SUCCESSFUL 
THEY COULD MARK THE START OF WIDER 
ECONOMIC REFORMS 
THE GOVERNMENT IS 
TRYING TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND 
EFFICIENCY IN THE AGRICULTURAL 
SECTOR CUBA NEEDS IN GENERAL 
IMPROVING EVER SI AND PRODUCTIVITY 
MAYBE THIS CHANGE COULD REPEAT IN 
OTHER SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY RAUL RAUL CASTRO IS CUBA'S FIRST NEW LEADER 
IN FIFTY YEARS HE WAS A DEDICATED 
COMMUNIST LONG BEFORE HIS BROTHER 
FIDEL HE'S ALSO KNOWN AS A PAG 
ACTIVITY WHO GETS THINGS DONE HE 
HAS LIFTED A RANGE OF RESTRICTIONS 
ON DAILY LIFE CROWDS GORTED 
OUTSIDE SHOPS SELLING MOBILE PHONES 
WHICH UNTIL NOW WERE RESTRICTED TO 
KEY GOVERNMENT WORKERS AND 
FOREIGNERS THE AVERAGE SALARY IS 
UNDER TWENTY DOLLARS A MONDAY FEW CAN AFFORD 
THEM MANY GET HELP FROM RELATIVES 
ABROAD IT IS REALLY GOOD TO BE 
ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR 
FAMILY THIS WOMAN WHO HE HAS A 
SISTER IN COSTA RICA TELLS ME THIS 
MAN THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT 
OPPORTUNITY AND WAS HOPEFUL WITH 
THE CHANGES TAKING PLACE EVERYONE 
COULD AFFORD ONE IN THE FUTURE 
EVEN THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO 
HARD CURRENCY ARE GOING TO THE 
SHOPS TO AT LEAST HAVE A LOOK AT 
WHAT IS ON OFFER THE STORES ARE 
FILLING UP WITH ALL SORTS OF 
ELECTRICAL GOODS THEY WERE NOT 
ALLOWED TO HAVE BEFORE PROVIDED 
YOU HAVE THE MONEY YOU CAN BUY A 
TELEVISION OR A WASHING MACHINE A 
LOT OF NEW THINGS HAVE APPEARED IN 
THE SHOPS THEY HAVE LIFTED 
RESTRICTIONS ON V. H. S. PLAYERS AND 
COMPUTER SCREENS COMPUTERS ARE 
ALLOWED BUT THEY HAVEN'T ARRIVED 
AND THESE SHELVES OF RICE COOKERS 
IS WERE THE D. V. D. PLAYERS WERE THEY 
HAVE ALL SOLD OUT THERE WERE D. V. D. 
PLAYERS IN ANOTHER STORE THEY HAVE 
ALL SOLD OUT 
IT'S BETTER TO BUY IT 
IN THE SHOP IT COMES WITH A 
WARRANTY IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE THAN 
I HOPED BUT LEGAL 
IT'S GREAT IF 
YOU HAVE THE MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE 
TO BUY IT ON THE BLACK MARKET 
LET'S HOPE MORE THINGS ARE ALLOWED 
SOON 
A CUBAN BAND WELCOMES SOON TOURISTS AS THEY CHECK IN IN A 
LUXURY RESORT HOTEL FOR YEARS ONLY 
FOREIGNERS WERE ALLOWED TO STAY AND 
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE BEACHES NOW 
CUBANS ARE ALLOWED TOO IN MANY 
WAYS THESE ARE SMALL BUT SYMBOLIC 
CHANGES THE GOODWILL HAS BROUGHT 
RAUL CASTRO TIME AS HE LOOKS FOR 
WAYS TO MAKE THIS SYSTEM WORK 
BETTER FIDEL CASTRO HAS WRITTEN 
ARTICLES ON NOT MAKING CONCESSIONS 
A REMINDER OF OUR TOP STORY JACOB 
ZUMA THE PRESIDENT OF SOUTH 
AFRICA'S A. N. C. PARTY TOLD THIS 
PROGRAMME THAT THE RECOUNT IN 
ZIMBABWE LACKS CREDIBILITY THE 
ONLY WAY FORWARD D. IS DIALOGUE
