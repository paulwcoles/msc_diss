TOUCHES A RECORD HIGH OF FIVE A 
GALLON OIL GIANT SHELL AND B. P. 
ANNOUNCE PROFITS OF SEVEN BILLION OVER 
THREE MONTHS 
WHEN YOU WORKING 
OVERTIME TO PAY FOR PETROL 
IT IS 
SHOCKING YOU HAVE A CAR THAT YOU 
CAN'T AFFORD TO DRIVE BECAUSE OF 
FUEL PRICES 
FACING FURTHER 
QUESTION THE AUSTRIAN MAN WHO 
IMPRISONED AN ABUSED HIS OWN 
DAUGHTER HOUSING SLOW DOWN 
MORTGAGE APPROVALS HAVE INTO THEIR 
LOWEST LEVELS SINCE RECORDS BEGAN 
AND LESS THAN A YEAR INTO THE JOB 
IS SVEN GORAN ERIKSSON ABOUT TO 
LEAVE MANCHESTER CITY LATER ON B. B. C. 
LONDON SWAPPING SIDE THE LABOUR 
M. P. PREPARING TO ADVICE THE TORIES 
IF BORIS BECOMES MAYOR AND A JURY 
HEARS HOW A TEENAGER WAS SHOT DEAD 
WHEN TRYING TO STOP A FIGHT 
GOOD AFTERNOON PRICES AT THE PUMPS 
HAVE HIT A RECORD HIGH AN AVERAGE 
OF FIVE A GALLON THE SOARING PRICES 
COME AS BRITAIN'S TWO BIGGEST OIL 
COMPANIES SHELL AND B. P. MADE 
COMBINED PROFITS OF MORE THAN SEVEN 
BILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS 
OF THE YEAR SHELL SAYS MOST OF ITS 
MONEY COMES FROM EXPLORATION AN 
PRODUCTION RATHER THAN FROM SELLING 
PETROL ON FORECOURTS IN BRITAIN BUT 
THE DOUBLE A. SAYS MOTORISTS ARE BEING 
BATTERED BY OIL COMPANY AND THE 
TREASURY OUR BUSINESS 
CORRESPONDENT REPORTS TRUCKS START 
GATHERING ALONG LONDON'S PARK LANE 
FROM MID MORNING THEY HAD COME FROM 
AS FAR AS WALES TO PROTEST AT 
RISING FUEL PRICE AND THE TAXES 
LEVIED ON FUEL BY THE GOVERNMENT 
LAST YEAR IT COST ROUND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY TO 
FILL UP ONE OF THESE TODAY IT IS 
CLOSER TO SEVEN HUNDRED 
RAW MATERIAL IS 
FUEL AND THAT HAS RISEN IN COST 
FROM THIRTY PER CENT OF OPERATING COSTS TO 
NEARLY FORTY PER CENT THE INDUSTRY HAS TO 
FIND THE MONEY TO PAY ITS FUEL BILL 
THE AIRLINES CHARGE THE CUSTOMER 
BEFORE THEY TAKE THE FLIGHT AND ADD 
A SUR CHANCE WE CAN'T DO THAT SURCHARGE ONE OF THE FACTORS 
DRIVING PRICES OF DIESEL AND 
PETROL EVER HIGHER FOR ALL DRIVERS 
IS THE SOARING COST OF OIL ON 
GLOBAL MARKS AND TODAY THAT HAS 
RESULTED IN RECORD PROFITS FOR TWO 
OF THE BIGGEST PLAYERS IN THE 
FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THE YEAR 
SHELL MADE THREE POINT NINE BILLION UP TWELVE PER CENT B. P. 
POSTED PROFITS OF THREE POINT THREE BILLION UP 
FORTY EIGHT PER CENT AND BACK ON THE FORECOURT THE 
AVERAGE PRICE OF A LITRE OF 
UNLEADED IS NOW ONE POINT ONE OH A LITRE OF 
DIESEL IS TEN ONE POINT TWO OH THAT IS 
ROUGHLY FIVE A GALLON IT IS LITTLE 
WONDER THESE DRIVES ARE SO 
CONCERNED THAT FILLING UP THEIR 
CARS IS EMPTYING THEIR WALLETS 
RIDICULOUS IT IS JUST GOING TO GO 
UP AND UP EVERYONE IS GOING TO 
NEED PETROL WHAT CAN YOU DO YOU YOU ARE WORKING OVERTIME TO PAY FOR 
PETROL SOMETIME IT IS NOT REALLY 
FAIR ON THE PUBLIC L. THINK THERE 
SHOULD BE A DISCREET DROP IN THE 
PRICES TO SUIT EVERYBODY'S NEEDS 
I THINK THE CHANCELLOR SHOULD LOOK 
AT THE TAX TAKE HE IS GETTING MORE 
MONEY FROM VAT AS THE PRICES GO UP 
HE IS GETTING MORE MONEY FROM NORTH 
SEA OIL REVENUES AS THE PRICES GO 
UP SO THERE IS PLENTY OF MONEY IN 
HIS KITTY FROM THE MOTORIST 
SOME ANALYSTS SAY OIL PRICES COULD 
FALL OVER THE NEXT FEW YEAR BUT FOR 
NOW MOTORISTS HAVE LITTLE 
ALTERNATIVE THAN TO KEEP DIGGING 
DEEPER ON THE STAY ON THE ROADS WE 
WOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHETHER THE 
PRICE OF FUEL HAS BEEN AFFECTED 
WHERE EVER YOU LIVE PERHAPS YOU 
HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE PRICE AT 
YOUR LOCAL PUMP YOU CAN SEND THEM 
TO THAT ADDRESS TELL US NOT JUST 
YOUR NAME BUT WHICH PART OF THE 
COUNTRY YOU ARE IN 
FURTHER TALKS ARE BEING HELD TODAY 
BETWEEN THE OWNERS OF THE 
GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY AND OFFICIALS 
FROM THE UNITE UNION IN AN ATTEMPT 
TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE ABOUT 
PENSIONS STAFF AT GRANGEMOUTH 
RETURNED TO WORK THIS MORNING 
FOLLOWING THEIR FORTY EIGHT HOUR STRIKE OUR 
SCOTLAND CORRESPONDENT IS AT 
GRANGEMOUTH THIS LUNCHTIME 
YES EARLIER THIS MORN SOME SIX TO 
SEVEN HOURS AGO THE WORKERS HERE 
LEFT THEIR PICKET LINES AND FILED 
BACK THROUGH THE GATES TO RESUME 
THEIR NORMAL DUTY TS SHORTLY AFTER 
THAT WE HEARD THE GRANGEMOUTH ROAR 
AGAIN THAT IS THE NOISE OF THE GAS 
FLARES AND THE STEAM BEING LET OUT 
INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE VARIOUS 
PARTS OF PLANT MACHINERY KICKING 
INTO ACTION AS PRODUCTION RESUMES 
THIS MORNING THE FIRST SIGNS THE 
GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY IS BACK IN 
BUSINESS BUT TURNING THE PLANT 
BACK ON SAFELY IS TRICKY BUSINESS 
AND IT WILL BE AT LEAST FORTNIGHT 
BEFORE FULL PRODUCTION IS RESUMED 
OVERSEEING THE PROCESS TODAY TWO 
GOVERNMENT MINISTER THE SCOTTISH 
FINANCE SECRETARY AND THE U. K. 
BUSINESS AND ENTERPRISE SECRETARY 
JOHN HUTTON BOTH EMPHASISING THE 
IMPORTANCE TO BRITAIN OF THE TWO 
SIDES SETTLING THIS DISPUTE 
I VERY 
MUCH WELCOME WHAT THE TRADE UNIONS 
AND INEOS HAVE BEEN SAYING ABOUT 
THE NEXT FEW WEEKS I THINK THERE 
SHOULD BE A PAUSE FOR RELEK E. 
REFLECTION THAT IS IMPORTANT L. 
HOPE THERE IS A WAY OF BRIDGE THE 
GAP THERE IS STILL A GAP BUT THEY 
ARE TO RESOLVE THIS 
THE RETURN TO WORK WAS A LOW KEY 
AFFAIR WORKERS DRIFTING INTO THE 
PLANT IN SMALL GROUPS SATISFIED 
THEY HAD MADE THEIR POINT BUT AWARE 
OF THE DAMAGE IT HAD INFLICTED ON 
THE ECONOMY AND FUEL SUPPLIES WE WE HAVE MADE OUR POINT BUT THAT IS NOT 
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT THE POINT IS TO 
TRY AND RESOL TELEVISION DISPUTE 
WE WANT TO NEGOTIATE THIS DISPUTE 
BUT THE COMPANY HAVE SAID THEY HAVE 
TOLD LIED THROUGHOUT THIS SO IT 
WAS ABOUT THE ONLY OPTION OPEN TO 
US 
THIS IS HAVING A DEVASTATING US IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND WE MUST 
REMEMBER THIS IS A BUSINESS THAT 
NEEDS HUGE AMOUNT OF HELP AND 
INVESTMENT GOING FORWARD AND WE 
NEED TO GET THE UNIONS TO COME BACK 
TO TALK TO US FOR THE SAKE OF THE 
BUSINESS 
BUT BOTH SIDES DO NOW BUSINESS SEEM TO BE LOOKING AHEAD THE 
BILLIONAIRE OWNER JIM RATCLIFFE 
WHOETS VISIT TO THE PLANT ROW VOKED 
ANGRY SCENES IS ENGAGED WITH SENIOR 
MEMBERS OF THE WRUN I DON'T KNOWS 
AT A SECRET LOCATION IN LONDON 
ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR AND OF COURSE ALL THOUGHTS 
HERE ARE ON THE SECRET TALKS IN 
LONDON BOTH SIDES NOW IT SEEMS 
CONTENT TO TRY TO FIND A SETTLEMENT 
TO THIS DISPUTE WELL AWAY FROM THE 
GLARE OF PUBLICITY 
AN AUSTRIAN MAN WHO CONFESSED TO 
IMPRISONING HIS DAUGHTERER FOR MORE 
THAN TWENTY YEARS AND FATHERING HER 
SEVEN CHILDREN HAS APPEARED IN 
COURT HIS DAUGHTER WHO IS FORTY TWO AND 
HER SIX SURVIVING CHILDREN ARE 
BEING CARED FOR BY THE AUTHORITIES 
OUR CORRESPONDENT IS FOLLOWING THE 
STORY IN AMSTETTEN THANK YOU 
AUSTRIAN PLACE SAY THEY HAVE BEEN 
SEARCHING OTHER PROPERTIES 
BELONGING TO JOSEF FRITZL LOOKING 
FOR OTHER HIDDEN DUNGEONS ALTHOUGH 
THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO FIND ANYTHING 
IN ADDITION TO THE HOUSE OF HORROR 
BEHIND ME MINE WHEEL HE IS 
EXPECTED TO BE PLACED IN CUSTODY 
FOR FOURTEEN DAYS FROM THE HOUSE OF 
HORROR TO AN AUSTRIAN COURTHOUSE 
JOSEF FRITZL WAS BROUGHT HERE AMID 
THE TIGHTEST SECURITY 
WE DECIDED TO PUT HIM IN A TWO PERSON CELL WE HAD TO 
THINK ABOUT A CERTAIN LEVEL OF 
SECURITY SECURITY ON THE ONE HAND TO PREVENT POSSIBLE 
SUICIDE AND TORE HAND TO PRO VENT 
ATTACKS FROM OTHER INMATES 
NOW SEVENTY THREE 
AND A RETIRED ENGINEER FRITZL 
COMMITTED WHAT POLICE ARE 
DESCRIBING AS ONE OF THE MOST 
SHOCKING CRIMES IN AUSTRIAN HISTORY 
H. HE TURNED THE BASEMENT INTO A 
SECRET DUNGEON AND KEPT HIS 
DAUGHTER LOCKED UP FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS IT 
IS HERE HE SEXUALLY ABUSED HER AND 
FATHERED HER SEVEN CHILDREN FOR 
AUSTRIANS WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN 
AMSTETTEN IS FAMILIAR NOT SO LONG 
AGO IT WAS A SIMILAR CASE IN 
ANOTHER TOWN INVOLVING ANOTHER 
GIRL NATASHA KAMPUSCH WHO HAD BEEN 
LOCKED IN A CELLAR FOR MORE THAN 
EIGHT YEARS AUSTRIANS ARE 
BEGINNING TO ASK WHY IS THIS 
HAPPENING IN THEIR COUNTRY 
THE SOUL SEARCHING HAS STARTED HERE 
THIS IS A NATION EMBARRASSED AND 
LOOKING FORANCES 
WE CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE I KNOW OF THREE CASES OF 
GIRLS LOCKED IN CELLAR THERE ARE 
SOME TERRIBLE PEOPLE AMONG US OVER OVER AT AMSTETTEN TOWN HALL THERE IS 
SIMILAR CONCERN 
IT IS A MATTER FOR 
THE AUSTRIANS AND THEY ARE 
FEELING LIKE US IN AMSTETTEN AND 
THE AUSTRIANS WILL WANT THAT 
SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN THAT SUCH 
THINGS CAN'T HAPPEN AGAIN STORIES STORIES OF TERRIFYING ABUSE IN SLEEPY 
AUSTRIAN TOWNS THAT IS WHAT IS SO 
SHOCKING TO THE MOLE WHOLE 
COUNTRY THE POLICE SEARCH HAS 
CONTINUED ALL MORNING AT THE 
BUILDING BEHIND ME THAT SEARCH OF 
COURSE CENTRED ON THE DEEP BASEMENT 
WHERE ELISABETH FRITZL HAD BEEN 
HELD AS A PRISONER FOR NEARLY A 
QUARTER OF A CENTURY HERE THERE 
HAS BEEN MORE BAD NEWS FOR HOME 
OWNERS AND PEOPLE WANTS TO BUY A 
NEW PROPERTY THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
SAYS THE NUMBER OF MORTGAGES 
APPROVED LAST MONTH FELL TO THE 
LOWEST LEVEL SINCE RECORDS BEGAN 
LET US GET MORE DETAILS FROM OUR 
ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT 
YES WITH THE CREDIT CRUNCH MAKING 
IT HARDER TO BORROW THERE IS 
FURTHER DRAMATIC EVIDENCE OF THE 
MORTGAGE SLOW DOWN FIGURES FROM 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND SHOW THAT 
MORTGAGE APPROVALS IN MARCH WERE 
DOWN FORTY FOUR PER CENT ON THE SAME MONTH A YEAR 
EARLIER AT THE LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 
RECORDS BE BAN IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE LAST WEEK 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND INJECTED FIFTY 
BILLION INTO THE MONEY MARKET TO 
TRY TO ENCOURAGE BANKS TO LEND TO 
EACH OTHER TODAY THE GOVERNOR WAS 
QUESTIONED BAY SELECT COMMITTEE OF 
M. P.'S 
THERE IS THE NEED FOR AN M. P.'S ADJUSTMENT IN THE MORTGAGE MARKET 
BUT I DO THINK THAT THE IMPROVED 
CONFIDENCE IN THE BANKING SECTOR 
WHICH I THINK THIS SCHEME WILL 
RESTORE WILL FEED THROUGH TO 
BORROWERS AND WE WILL SEE THE 
MORTGAGE MARKET OPERATING ON A MORE 
NORMAL BASIS 
BUT MORTGAGE 
AVAILABILITY HASN'T GOT ANY EASIER 
SINCE THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S 
INITIATIVE ACCUSE ACCORDING TO A 
PERSONAL FINANCE WEBSITE THE 
AVERAGE BEST TWO YEAR FIXED RATE 
DEAL FROM THE MAIN LENDERS IS UP 
ZERO POINT FOUR ONE PER CENT ON WHERE IT WAS A WEEK AGO 
THE NUMBER OF LENDERS OFFERING 
LOANS OF NINETY PER CENT OF THE PROPERTY HAS 
FALLEN BY SIX FINANCAL ADVISERS 
SAY IT IS GETTING EVER HARDER TO 
FIND A MORTGAGE 
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE IS 
CLIENT COMES TO SEE US TO GET A 
MORTGAGE WE GO THROUGH THE DETAIL 
WITH HIM COME ONE A PRODUCT HE 
LIKE QUITE RIGHTLY HE SAY GIVE ME 
A DAY OR SO TO THINK ABOUT I COMES 
BACK BY WHICH TIME IT HAS BEEN 
PULLED SO WE HAVE TO START AGAIN 
AND THERE IS NEWS TODAY ANOTHER 
BANK HBOS IS HAVING TO GO TO ITS 
SHAREHOLDERS TO RAISE CASH FOR 
FOUR BILLION WHILE THAT SORT OF 
THING GOES ON THE BANKS WON'T BE IN 
MUCH OF A MOOD TO LEND EVEN MORE TO 
HOME BUYERS

ATTACKED BY HER FAMILY'S ROT 
WILEERS AT A PUB IN LEICESTER 
CADEY LEE DEACON WAS ASLEEP WHEN 
TWO DOGS USED TO GUARD THE PROPERTY 
CAME INTO HER ROOM AND MAULED HER 
SARAH CAMPBELL IS IN LEICESTER A 
CORONER CALLED IT A HORRIFIC EVENT 
BABY CADEY LEE WAS ASLEEP ON HER 
OWN FOR A FEW MINUTES WHILE HER 
MOTHER AND STEPFATHER WERE 
DOWNSTAIRS PACKING GETTING READY 
TO MOVE HOUSE N. THAT TIME THE TWO 
DOGS MANAGED TO GET ACCESS TO THE 
BEDROOM WHERE SHE SWUZ SLEEPING AND 
ONE OR BOTH OF THEM MAULED HER TO 
DEATH PROTECTED FROM VIEW CADEY'S 
MOTHER AND STEPFATHER ARRIVED 
KNOWING THEY WOULD HAVE TO REVISIT 
THAT TRAGIC AFTERNOON AMY BURCHELL 
HAS BEEN LIVING IN THE AREA WITH 
HER BABY AND LEE HE WAS THE 
MANAGER OF THE ROCKET PUB ALSO 
KEPT AT THE PUB WERE LEE'S DOG TWO 
ROTTWEILERS THEY WERE KEPT 
SEPARATE FROM THE LIVING QUARTERSS 
ON A FLAT ROOF ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY THIRD 
TWO THOUSAND SIX THAT WHICH THEY WERE ME RE 
PREPARING TO MOVE AS THEY PACKED 
CADEY LEE SLEPT UPSTAIRS T. THE 
DOOR FROM THE ROOF HAD ACCIDENTALLY 
BEEN LEFT OPEN 
HER MOTHER FOUND HER COVERED IN 
BLOOD NEXT TO THE MALE DOG SHE 
RUSHED HER TO HOSPITAL BUT SHE 
SUFFERED BITES TO HER HEAD CHEST 
AND ABDOMEN AND DIED RECORD AGO 
VERDICT OF ACCIDENTAL DEATH THE 
CORONER SAID THE FAMILY HAD BEEN 
AWARE OF THE NEED TO EXERCISE 
CAUTION WITH THE DOGS AND HAD NOT 
LET THEM ROAM ROUND THIS WAS AN 
UNEXPECTED ATTACK IN WRITTEN 
EVIDENCE READ OUT IN COURT LEE 
BURCHELL SAID THE DOGS HAD BEEN 
SUPERVISE AND NEVER SHOWN ANY 
INTEREST WITH HER THEY PLAYED WITH 
CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITHOUT GIVING 
ANY CAUSE FOR CONCERN CADEY LEE'S 
MOTHER SAID OF HER DAUGHTER SHE 
WAS MY ONLY CHILD AND MEANT 
EVERYTHING TO ME AMY AND LEE 
BURCHELL LEFT COURT WITHOUT MAKING 
ANY COMMENT THEY CLEARLY HAVE BEEN 
VISIBLY UPSET DURING THIS MORNING'S 
INQUEST IN HER WRITTEN STATEMENT 
AMY SAID THIS WAS THE MOST TRAGIC 
LOIS COULD EVER FACE 
LOSS SENDING YOUR CHILD TO AL 
NURSERY OR PLAY GROUP CAN HELP 
PROTECT THEM AGAINST LEUKAEMIA 
RESEARCHERS IN THE U. S. SAYS THEY 
HAVE FOUND THE CLEAREST EVIDENCE 
YET THAT CHILDREN EXPOSED TO 
INFECTIONSS AT A YOUNG AGE HAVE A 
LOWER RISK OF DEVELOPING THE COMMON 
NEST FORM OF THE DISEASE OUR HOLTH 
CORRESPONDENT REPORTS 
THESE TODDLERS ARE LEARNING TO PLAY 
TOGETHER BUT THEY ARE ALSO 
ENCOUNTERING MANY MORE INFECTIONS 
THAN THEY WOULD MEET AT HOME AND 
TODAY'S RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT MAY 
REDUCE BY THIRTY PER CENT THEIR RISK OF 
ACQUIRING THE COMMONEST FORM OF 
LEUKAEMIA SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS 
ONE IN EVERY TWO THOUSAND CHILDREN THE 
THEORY IS THAT CHILDREN LIKE THESE 
WHO GET LOTS OF EXPOSURE TO 
INFECTION HAVE THEIR IMMUNE 
SYSTEMS CHALLENGED AT A VERY EARLY 
AGE BUT KIDS WHO DON'T GET THAT 
AND HAVE A PARTICULAR GENETIC 
MUTATION ARE FAR MORE VULNERABLE 
TO GOING ON TO DEVELOP LEUKAEMIA 
SCIENTISTS TODAY SIR THERE IS A 
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW PEOPLE 
GET THE DISEASE AND HOW TO PREVENT 
IT 
YOU CAN BE QUITE CONFIDENT IN IT SAYING TO PARENTS SEND YOUR 
CHILDREN TO DAY CARE AND LET THEM 
EAT DIRT AND HAVE LOTS OF 
INFECTIONS IT IS GOOD FOR THEM 
AND IT IS NICE TO SAY THOSE THINGS 
WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE 
AND THAT COMES AS WELCOME NEWS TO 
PARENTS AT THIS GROUP 
IT IS 
FANTASTIC IN GENERAL I THINK 
EXPOSING MY CHILD TO OTHER CHILDREN 
IS GOOD FOR GENERAL IMMUPT IF I 
KEPT HER CLOSED IMMUNITY IF I 
KEPT HER CLOSED UP AT HOME SHE 
WOULD GET SICK WHEN SHE DID JOIN 
SCHOOL 
I THINK THIS IS GOOD SCHOOL BECAUSE IT BUILDS UP THEIR IMMUNE 
SYSTEM 
I THINK IT IS GOOD BECAUSE SYSTEM IF THEY DIDN'T WHEN THEY'RE FOUR 
AND GO TO SCHOOL THEY'RE GOING TO 
GET IT HARDER 
CHILDHOOD LEUKAEMIA 
IS A COMPLICATED CONDITION WITH 
VARIOUS CAUSES BUT MAKING SURE 
YOUR TODDLER ENCOUNTERS LOTS OF 
INFECTIONS MAY BE JUST ONE WAY TO 
PREVENT IT 
THE TOP STORY 
THE PRICE OF PETROL TOUCHES A 
RECORD HIGH OF FIVE A GALLON AS OIL 
COMPANIES B. P. AND SHELL ANNOUNCE 
STRONG PROFITS 
COMING UP WE'VE ALL HEARD OF 
COUNTING SHEEP BUT COUNTING 
PUFFINS CONSERVATIONISTS SET 
THEMSELVES A TOUGH JOB 
ON B. B. C. LONDON THE FATHERS WHO FEEL 
THEY'RE FAILING TO BE GOOD ROLE 
MODELS BECAUSE OF WORK PRESSURES 
AND MUSIC IN YOUR FRONT ROOM CAN 
A NEW MARKETING PLOY BRING STARDOM 
TO THIS LONDON SINGER 
TWO ELDERLY SISTERS HAVE LOST A THIRTY 
YEAR BATTLE TO HAVE THE SAME 
INHERITANCE TAX TREATMENT AS 
MARRIED PEOPLE OR COUPLES WHO HAVE 
HAD A CIVIL PARTNERSHIP JOYCE 
BURDEN AND HER SISTER SYBIL SHARE 
A HOUSE IN WILTSHIRE AND HAD ARGUED 
THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE LIABLE FOR 
INHERITANCE TAX WHEN ONE OF THEM 
DIES THEY HAVE LIVED TOGETHER ALL 
THEIR LIVES EIGHTY NINE YEAR OLD JOYCE AND 
EIGHT YEAR OLD SYBIL BURDEN BUT THE 
HIGHEST COURT IN EUROPE SAYS THE 
SISTERS DON'T HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS 
AS ALMOST ALL OTHER CO HABITING 
COUPLES THE RECLUSIVE PAIR DIDN'T 
WANT TO TALK TO THE MEDIA TODAY 
BUT THE HOME THEY SHARE IN A 
WILTSHIRE VILLAGE A NEPHEW TOLD ME 
THE SISTERS WERE DEVASTATED WITH 
THE EUROPEAN COURT'S DECISION VERY VERY ANGRY 
DID 
THEY EXPECT THIS NO ANGRY NO THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY BECAUSE 
EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTRY AS FAR AS 
THEY COULD SEE WAS FOR THEM LET LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES 
THE SISTERS SO ANGRY IF ANYBODY 
ELSE IN THIS VILLAGE OR ANYWHERE 
ELSE IN BRITAIN THEY CAN LEAVE 
THEIR PROPERTY TO THEIR HUSBAND OR 
WIFE OR CIVIL PARTNER AND NO 
INHERITANCE TAX HAS TO BE PAID BUT 
IF YOU LEAVE YOUR PROPERTY TO YOUR 
BROTHER OR SISTER EVEN IF YOU HAVE 
LIVED TOGETHER ALL YOUR LIVES LIKE 
THE BURDEN SISTERS HAVE THEN 
INHERITANCE TAX DOES HAVE TO BE 
PAID IN FULL 
THE SISTERS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THAT 
FOR MORE THAN 
YEARS BUT TODAY 
THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
SAID INDIVIDUAL GOVERNMENTS MUST 
HAVE DISCRETION OVER THE WAY THEY 
SET TAXES 
THEY HAD REALLY HOPED 
THAT THEY WOULD GET THIS TODAY AND 
THEY FEEL DEVASTATED AND VERY LET 
DOWN THEY HAVE HOWEVER VOWED TO 
CONTINUE FIGHTING THIS IS AN ISSUE 
ABOUT WHICH THEY FEEL VERY STRONGLY 
AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO LOBBY 
PARLIAMENT AND THEIR M. P. FOR A 
CHANGE IN THE LEGISLATION BUT BUT THEIR LEGAL BATTLE IS NOW OVER THE 
SISTERS CAN GO NO FURTHER IN A 
STATEMENT THEY SAID THEY FELT 
PERSECUTED FOR NOT BEING MARRIED 
AND FOR STAYING TOGETHER AS SISTERS 
ONE IN SEVEN PRIMARY SCHOOL 
CHILDREN IN ENGLAND DO NOT SPEAK 
ENGLISH AT THEIR FIRST LANGUAGE 
THAT IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL EVER 
RECORDED AND IS NEARLY DOUBLE THE 
FIGURE OF A DECADE AGO 
BRIDGING THE GROWING LANGUAGE GAP 
A. N. N. MOORE IS A TEACHING ASSISTANT 
IN AN INFANT SCHOOL IN SOMERSET 
BUT SO MANY OF HER PUPILS NOW SPEAK 
POLISH RATHER THAN ENGLISH SHE 
AND OTHER STAFF AT THE SCHOOL HAVE 
DECIDED TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE 
THEMSELVES SO THEY CAN HELP THEM 
LEARN MORE EFFECTIVELY 
THEY COME 
HERE NOT BEING ABLE TO SPEAK 
ANYTHING AND CANNOT COMMUNICATE 
WITH US IF THEY FEEL WE'RE TRYING 
TO MAKE AN EFFORT OURSELVES IT 
WILL GIVE THEM THE CONFIDENCE TO 
TRY AND SPEAK ENGLISH 
SO HOW BIG 
HAS THE CHANGE BEEN IN THE LAST 
DECADE TEN YEARS AGO TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND 
CHILDREN HAD ENGLISH AS A SECOND 
LANGUAGE THAT HAS NOW ALMOST 
DOUBLED TO FOUR HUNDRED SEVEN THOUSAND THAT MEANS 
TODAY MORE THAN ONE CHILD IN SEVEN 
IN A PRIMARY SCHOOL DOES NOT HAVE 
ENGLISH AS THEIR FIRST LANGUAGE 
IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU KNOW IT 
STAMP YOUR FEET 
BUT SOME SCHOOLS ARE AFFECTED MORE 
THAN OTHERS AT THIS PRIMARY SCHOOL 
MORE CHILDREN ARE RECENTLY ARRIVED 
POLISH IMMIGRANTS THE SCHOOL SAYS 
IT IS COPING BUT WISHES IT HAD HAD 
SOME HELP FROM THE GOVERNMENT THE THE GOVERNMENT WERE CAUGHT ON THE HOP 
PARTICULARLY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES 
IN TERMS OF THE LARGE IMMIGRANT 
POPULATION I THINK WE WEREN'T 
PREPARED AND I THINK WE COULD HAVE 
DONE BETTER 
THE SCHOOL IS TRYING HARD TO ENSURE 
LANGUAGE PROBLEMS DON'T HOLD BACK 
THE POLISH PUPILS OR THEIR ENGLISH 
COLLEAGUES AND MANY PARENTS FELT 
THERE WERE POSITIVE BENEFITS I I THINK THE MORE CULTURES AVAILABLE 
THE BETTER FOR THE CHILDREN THE 
WIDER THEIR SCOPE AND UNDERSTANDING 
OF EVERYBODY 
MY SON REALLY GOOD 
LEARN ENGLISH IT IS GOOD SCHOOL 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS 
INCREASING LANGUAGE FUNDING BUT 
TODAY'S FIGURES SHOW MIGRATION IS 
CONTINUING TO HAVE AN IMPACT IN 
SCHOOLS SCHOOLS A NEW CENTRE AUFPBG SUPPORT AND 
COUNSELLING FOR CANCER PATIENTS AND 
THEIR FAMILIES HAS OPENED IN LONDON 
KNOWN AS MAGY'S CENTRE IT IS THE 
FIRST TO BE OPENED OUTSIDE SCOTLAND 
NYE HIGHAM IS THERE 
CHARING CROSS HOSPITAL IN LONDON IS 
NEVER GOING TO WIN ANY 
ARCHITECTURAL AWARDS IT IS 
FRUNCTIONIAL AND FRANKLY RATHER 
GRIM FUNCTIONAL BUT LOOK WHAT 
LORD RODGERS HAS BUILT IN THE 
GROUNDS FPLTD NIGELLA LAWSON AND 
OTHERS OPENED THE CENTRE 
THE CENTRES' EXIST ARCHITECTS HAVE 
BEEN DESIGNED BY SOME OF THE MOST 
EXCITING ARCHITECTS IN THE 
WORLDMENT 
THE CENTRES OFFER COUNSELLING AND 
SUPPORT TO CANCER PATIENTS AND 
THEIR FAMILIES THE KIND OF SUPPORT 
HOSPITAL CANCER CLINICS CANNOT GIVE 
WHEN YOU COME INTO THE CENTRE IT IS 
LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE HAVE 
AN IMAGINARY KIND OF DUST THAT THEY 
SPRINKLE OVER YOU AND IT PICKS YOU 
UP AND YOU DON'T REALISE IT IS 
HAPPENING 
THE HIGH WALLS ARE HAPPENING DESIGN TO KEEP OUT THE TRAFFIC 
NOISE BUT INSIDE IT IS BRIGHT AND 
HOMELY EVEN WITH A KITCHEN 
THE CENTRES WERE DESIGNED BY 
ARCHITECT MAGGIE KESWICK WHO 
HERSELF WAS A CANCER PATIENT SHE SHE WOULD DESCRIBE HOW SHE KNOCKED ON 
THE DOOR OF THE DOCTOR AND WENT IN 
AND WAS TOLD SHE HAD CANCER AND 
THEN WAS PUT OUTSIDE AND SHE FELT 
THERE HAD TO AN PLACE WHERE YOU 
COULD THINK CRY AND TALK AND MEET 
OTHERS WHO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM 
AND GET SOME PERSPECTIVE THE THE CENTRE OPERATORS SAY IT WON'T MAKE 
YOU BETTER BUT YOU CAN HELP WITH A 
CUP OF TEA THE FIRST THING THAT 
HAPPENS WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH THE 
DOOR IS THAT THEY PUT THE KETTLE ON 
AND THERE WILL BE FIVE MORE CENTRES 
IN ENGLAND AND WALES IN THE NEXT 
FEWERS FEWERS WITH THEIR RAINBOW BILLS AND 
DISTINCTIVE PLUMAGE YOU WOULD 
THINK THAT PUFFINS WOULD BE EASY TO 
SPOT AND COUNT BUT THOSE CARRYING 
OUT A CONSENSUS ON THE FARNE 
ISLANDS HAVE FOUND THAT THE BIRDS 
ARE NOT AS FRIENDLY AS FIRST 
THOUGHT THEY ARE AFACTIONNATELY 
CALLED THE CLOWNS OF THE AIR THEIR 
FUNNY WALKS AND BRIGHT PLUMES MAKE 
THEM A FAVOURITE WITH VISITORS BUT 
HERE ON THE FARNE ISLANDS EVERY 
FIVE YEARS THERE IS A HEAD COUNT 
NOT EASY WHEN THEY ALL KEEP MOVING 
THE COUNTERS SAY THERE IS A REAL 
VALUE TO THE SURVEY 
IT IS VERY 
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE PUFFINS ARE 
ALMOST AN ENVIRONMENTAL BAROMETER 
FOR THE FARNE ISLANDS AND THE NORTH 
SEA IN GENERAL AND COUNTING THE 
PUFFIN POPULATION WE CAN SEE 
AFTER EVERY FIVE YEARS IF THEY'RE 
DOING WELL OR BADLY AND IF IF SO 
THE REASONS BEHIND IT 
PUFFINS NEST 
IN BURROWS WHERE EACH PAIR RAISES 
A SINGLE CHICK SO TO GET AN 
ACCURATE COUNT THE LONG ARM OF THE 
WARDEN COMES CALLING 
WE'LL RING A 
SMALL NUMBER OF BIRDS DURING THE 
SEASON AND GET THEM OUT AND CHECK 
THEIR WEIGHT AND BODY MASS AND THEN 
PUT IT BACK DOWN INTO THE BURROW 
THE RESULTS SO FAR THIS YEAR ARE 
ENCOURAGING AND IF THE PUFFIN 
NUMBERS ARE ON THE INCREASE THAT IS 
GOOD NEWS FOR ALL THE OTHER BIRDS 
THAT LIVE HERE TOO SUCH AS THIS 
RAZORBILL AND THE SHAGGING CLEANING 
ITSELF BEHIND IT WHICH MEANS THERE 
IS ENOUGH FISH IN THE SEA TO 
SUPPORT THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
BIRDS THAT COME HERE IN THE SUMMER 
BUT THE PUFFINS DRAW THE CROWDS 
THEY ARE VERY COMECAL AND LIKEABLE 
BIRDS 
THEY ARE VERY COMECAL AND BIRDS HOP AROUND WHICH IS VERY ENDEARING 
THEY'RE LOVELY LITTLE THINGS 
EXPERTS HOPE TO COUNT SIXTY THOUSAND PAIRS 
BREEDING ON THIS COLONY IN THE 
COMING WEEKS 
THE B. B. C. HAS LEARNT THIS LUNCHTIME 
THAT SVEN GORAN ERIKSSON HAS BEEN 
TOLD HE WILL BE SACKED AS THE 
MANAGER OF MANCHESTER CITY THIS 
SUMMER THE FORMER ENGLAND MANAGER 
MET THE CLUB'S OWNER THAKSIN 
SHINAWTRA AT THE WEEKEND TO 
DISCUSS HIS RECENT COMMENTS THIS HE 
WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THE TEAM'S 
PERFORMANCE MORE FROM JAMES PEARCE 
ANY SURPRISE IN THIS 
A LOT OF 
SURPRISE AMONGST THE FANS A GREAT 
DEAL OF SHOCK DISAPPOINTMENT AND 
CONSIDERABLE ANGER AS WELL BECAUSE 
SVEN GORAN ERIKSSON HAS ACTUALLY 
BEEN A VERY POPULAR MANAGER HERE 
HE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN LOVED BY 
ENGLAND FANS AT THE END OF HIS TERM 
AS THE ENGLAND COACH BUT 
MANCHESTER CITY HAVE HAD ONE OF 
THEIR BEST SEASON IN YEARS RECENTLY 
AND LOOK LIKE FINISHING IN THE TOP 
HALF OF THE PREMIERSHIP THEY HAVE 
BEATEN THEIR RIVALS MANCHESTER 
UNITED HOME AND AWAY THIS SEASON 
AND THE CRY FROM THE FANS ONE 
STABILITY STABILITY PLEASE CAN 
WE HAVE STABILITY BECAUSE THIS 
CLUB IN RECENT YEARS HAS GONE 
THROUGH MANAGERS LIKE MOST PEOPLE 
GO THROUGH TOOTHBRUSHS NOW THEY 
WANT TO BUILD ON THIS SUCCESS BUT 
THAT SEEMS UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
NOW LET'S TURN OUR ATTENTIONS 
FINALLY TO THE LATEST WEATHER 
PROSPECTS KIRSTY IS WITH ME HOW 
HAS IT BEEN LOOKING 
WELL IT HAS 
BEEN LOOKING WET UNFORTUNATELY 
AND THERE ARE MORE AEROPLANE 
SHOWERS ON THE WAY 
APRIL SHOWERS ON THE WAY 
EARLIER ON IN THE SOUTH THERE WAS 
A PERSISTENT BAND OF HEAVY RAIN 
CREEPING ACROSS DEVON AND CORNWALL 
AND THAT WILL CONTINUE TO SLIDE IN 
ACROSS MUCH OF SOUTHERN ENGLAND 
DURING THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON 
BY THIS AFTERNOON GLIMMER OF 
BRIGHTNESS IN THE FAR SOUTH WEST 
BUT FOR MOST OF US IT WILL BE WET 
AND FEELING CHILLY IN THE BAND OF 
RAIN FURTHER NORTH THERE IS A 
SCATTERING OF SHOWERS LIKE MEASLES 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE U. K. BUT BECAUSE 
THE WINDS ARE LIGHTER THE SHOWERS 
ARE SLOW MOVING SO IF YOU'RE CAUGHT 
IN ONE YOU'LL KNOW ABOUT IT IN THE 
HEAVY SHOWERS ACROSS NORTHERN PARTS 
THERE 
IS RISK OF HAIL AND THUNDER 
SO FOR MOST OF US IT IS CASE OF 
KEEPING THE BROLLIES CLOSE TO HAND 
SO ACROSS THE SOUTH THERE IS THIS 
BAND OF RAIN WHICH WILL TRUNDLE 
NORTHWARDS PIVOTING AROUND SLOWLY 
AS IT DOES SO 
ON WEDNESDAY A SECOND BAND OF RAIN 
WILL CREEP UP FROM THE CHANNEL BY 
THE EARLY HOURS OF TOMORROW MORNING 
BUT NOT COLD TEMPERATURES AND 
TOMORROW WE WILL BE DODGING 
SHOWERS AGAIN AND IT WILL BE 
BREEZY AND YOU CAN SEE THIS 
DISTINCTIVE SHAPE THAT THE WEATHER 
FRONT IS WRAPPED AROUND IN A SPIRAL 
FASHION AND YOU CAN SEE THE CIRCLE 
OF RAIN ACROSS THE U. K. FOR TOMORROW 
FOR SCOTLAND PRETTY WET DAY AS 
THE CLOUD MOVES FROM EAST TO WEST 
NORTHERN IRELAND NOT TOO BAD AND 
IN ENGLAND AND WALES MORE HEAVY 
SHOWERS TO LOOK OUT FOR AND THE ODD 
RUMBLE OF THUNDER WILL BE POSSIBLE 
BOTH IT SHOULD BE WARMER STILL 
MORE SHOWERS TO COME BUT HOPEFULLY 
NOT AS MANY SHOWERS TO COME SO ON 
THURSDAY I THINK THERE SHOULD BE 
BRIGHTNESS MAINLY TO EASTERN AREAS 
TEMPERATURES A DEGREE OR SO HIGHER 
THIRTEENS OR FOURTEENS BUT STILL POTENTIAL FOR 
SHOWERS AS WE HEAD THROUGH THE DAY 
SO MORE TO COME ON AND OFF BUT IT 
WILL GET BETTER 
THE WEEKEND 
AND THAT IS JUST ABOUT 
IT FROM US ENJOY YOUR AFTERNOON ON 
B. B. C. ONE WE JOIN THE B. B. C.'S NEWS 
TEAMS WHERE EVER YOU ARE WELCOME TO B. B. C. LONDON
