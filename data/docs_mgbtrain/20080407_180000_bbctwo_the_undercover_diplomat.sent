IN NOVEMBER NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT JONATHAN POWELL 
PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR'S CHIEF OF STAFF 
ONE OF THE MOST SENIOR OFFICIALS IN THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT 
GOT A CALL THAT WOULD CHANGE HIS LIFE 
MARTIN MCGUINNESS CALLED ME UP AND SAID WOULD I COME OUT AND SEE HIM INCOGNITO 
I JOKED AND SAID I'LL COME IF YOU DON'T KILL ME 
MARTIN MCGUINNESS WAS CHIEF NEGOTIATOR OF SINN FEIN 
YOU'RE A CROWD OF ORANGEMEN IN UNIFORMS THAT'S ALL YOUSE ARE 
AND FORMERLY A MEMBER OF THE I. R. A. 
HIS DISTRUST OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WAS SO INTENSE 
HE'D ASKED POWELL TO TRAVEL WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF BRITAIN'S SECURITY SERVICES 
THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO KNEW I'D GONE WERE TONY AND MY SECRETARY BUT NO ONE ELSE DID 
POWELL WAS ABOUT TO BECOME TONY BLAIR'S UNDERCOVER DIPLOMAT 
THIS IS THE STORY OF HOW JONATHAN POWELL NEGOTIATED WITH SINN FEIN 
IN SECRET FOR NEARLY A DECADE TO PREVENT A RETURN TO VIOLENCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
HE HAD A VITAL HIDDEN ROLE IN A PEACE PROCESS 
THAT MANY TIMES TEETERED DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO FAILURE 
MARTIN'S INSTRUCTIONS WERE TO GET MYSELF TO DERRY TO STAND OUTSIDE THE TRINITY HOTEL 
AND WAIT UNTIL 
SOMEONE APPROACHED ME 
AND THAT'S WHAT I DID NO ROLLED UP COPY OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES NO RED CARNATION JUST STANDING WAITING 
HAD YOU EVER BEEN INVOLVED IN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE 
NO NO I HAD NO COVERT TRAINING OR ANYTHING OF THE SORT 
IT WAS QUITE EXCITING 
POWELL'S ESTABLISHMENT BACKGROUND WAS A WORLD AWAY FROM THE STREETS OF DERRY 
HE WENT FROM PRIVATE SCHOOL TO OXFORD 
AND THEN TO THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE 
TWO MEMBERS OF HIS IMMEDIATE FAMILY HAD BEEN I. R. A. TARGETS 
MY FATHER HAD BEEN A SERVICEMAN IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE NINETEEN FORTY 
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR 
AND WAS HIMSELF UM AMBUSHED BY THE I. R. A. ON THE WAY BACK TO HIS LITTLE COTTAGE 
HE'D BEEN BICYCLING BACK FROM THE AIR BASE THEY TOOK A SHOT AT HIM 
WHICH WENT THROUGH HIS EAR LEAVING A MARK WHICH IS STILL THERE 
MY ELDEST BROTHER CHARLES WHO WORKED FOR MRS. THATCHER FOR EIGHT YEARS AS A POLICY ADVISOR 
WAS ALSO ON THE DEATH LIST OF THE I. R. A. 
WHEN BLAIR TOOK POWER POWELL BECAME HIS RIGHT HAND MAN HANDLING THE MOST SENSITIVE MATTERS OF STATE 
MY DAY JOB WAS TO BE CHIEF OF STAFF TO TRY AND RUN DOWNING STREET 
AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PRIME MINISTER'S WRIT RAN THROUGH GOVERNMENT 
BOTH ON THE POLITICAL AND THE CIVIL SERVICE SIDE 
AND IT WAS BY ACCIDENT I ENDED UP DEALING WITH NORTHERN IRELAND 
TONY BLAIR NEEDED A TRUSTED MEMBER OF HIS INNER CIRCLE TO NEGOTIATE ON HIS BEHALF 
AND THAT WAS HOW POWELL ENDED UP WAITING ON A STREET CORNER IN DERRY 
TWO MEN CAME UP TO ME AND SAID MARTIN SENT US 
SLIGHTLY OMINOUS LOOKING MEN WITH SHAVED HEADS 
I FOLLOWED THEM AND GOT INTO A BLACK TAXI AND WENT OFF WITH THEM 
THE I. R. A. HAD BEEN ON CEASEFIRE FOR TWO YEARS 
BUT THERE COULD BE NO LASTING PEACE UNTIL THEY GAVE UP THEIR WEAPONS 
POWELL WAS HERE TO ASK SINN FEIN TO BRING ABOUT I. R. A. DECOMMISSIONING 
THEY DROVE ME ROUND AND ROUND IN CIRCLES THAT WENT ON FOR EVER 
I GOT INCREASINGLY LOST 
I THINK WE ENDED UP SOMEWHERE UP THERE IN THE CRAGGAN ESTATE IN A MODERN HOUSE 
THEY KNOCKED ON THE DOOR THE DOOR OPENED NO ONE CAME OUT 
JUST INSIDE WAS MARTIN MCGUINESS ON A BROKEN LEG ON CRUTCHES 
THEY LET ME IN AND I WENT IN AND SAT DOWN 
HE HAD A FIRE GOING IN THE MAIN ROOM THE LADY OF THE HOUSE HAD GONE OUT 
AND NOT ASKED ANY QUESTIONS LEFT SOME BISCUITS AND HE MADE SOME TEA 
WE SAT IN FRONT OF THE FIRE AND STARTED A DISCUSSION 
THROUGHOUT HIS DECADE IN DOWNING STREET POWELL KEPT A DIARY 
AN INSIDER'S RECORD THAT HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE 
IT'S A FAIRLY CANDID DIARY 
IT'S A VERY CANDID DIARY AND USEFUL FOR KNOWING WHAT YOUR INTENTIONS WER 
AT A PARTICULAR MOMENT INSTEAD OF LOOKING BACK WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT 
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AT THE TIME 
CANDID AND ALSO SOMETIMES UNDIPLOMATIC 
YES IT'S CERTAINLY UNDIPLOMATIC BUT THEN THAT'S MY REAL PERSONA AS TONY OR ANYONE WILL TELL YOU 
THAT IT WAS FAIRLY STRAIGHT TALKING 
SO WEDNESDAY EIGHTEENTH NOVEMBER NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT 
MARTIN MCGUINNESS KEPT SAYING DECOMMISSIONING WAS NOT POSSIBLE 
THE HISTORY MEANT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE SURRENDER AND HIS TROOPS WERE GETTING RESTIVE 
POWELL LEFT DERRY EMPTY HANDED 
BUT THIS FIRST MISSION UNDERCOVER HAD LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF WHAT 
WOULD BECOME AN EXTRAORDINARY BOND OF TRUST 
SINCE HE AND TONY BLAIR LEFT NUMBER TEN POWELL HAS REVISITED THE SECRET MISSION BLAIR GAVE HIM 
AND THE DILEMMAS HE FACED 
DID YOU HAVE MORAL QUALMS IN DEALING WITH TERRORISTS 
HERE ARE PEOPLE WHO A MOVEMENT WHO 
HAVE MURDERED LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE 
YES I DID AT ONE LEVEL BUT AT ANOTHER LEVEL I REALISED THAT 
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THEIR OWN STORY TO TELL 
YOU KNOW AND I COULDN'T PUT MY HAND ON MY HEART AND SAY THAT EVERY 
ACTION OF EVERY ARM OF THE BRITISH STATE HAD ALSO BEEN UM 
ABOVE BOARD OR RIGHT OR HADN'T CAUSED IMMENSE PAIN AND GRIEF AS WELL 
BUT THE TRUTH IS AND IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'VE GOT TO DO IN THESE SITUATIONS 
IS IF YOU CAN'T SEPARATE YOURSELF OUT SOMEHOW 
POLITICALLY FROM THE EMOTION OF THAT THEN THEN REALLY 
I'M AFRAID YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE 
GERRY ADAMS AND MARTIN MCGUINNESS HAD BEEN LEADING FIGURES IN THE REPUBLICAN STRUGGLE SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
FOR MANY YEARS THEY JUSTIFIED I. R. A. BOMBINGS AND KILLINGS 
THEIR CRITICS ALLEGE BUT BOTH ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS DENY 
THAT THE TWO MEN REMAINED MEMBERS OF THE I. R. A. ARMY COUNCIL 
POWELL AND BLAIR HAD FIRST MET THEM 
SHORTLY AFTER BLAIR'S ELECTION VICTORY IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
THE CAMERAS FILMED THE TWO SIDES ARRIVING BUT THEY DIDN'T RECORD WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE 
HERE WE ARE ACTUALLY MEETING THESE PEOPLE WHO FOR MORE THAN A DECADE 
HAD BEEN WAGING A TERRORIST CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE BRITISH STATE AND PEOPLE 
SO I THINK WHEN THEY CAME INTO THE ROOM THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF NERVOUSNESS ON OUR SIDE 
BUT ALSO I NOTICED ON THEIR SIDE I REMEMBER GERRY ADAMS'S HAND SHAKING AS HE CAME IN AND SAT DOWN 
AT FIRST IT WAS DIFFICULT TALKING TO 
WHAT HAD BEEN TERRORISTS FOR YEARS 
HADN'T EVEN HEARD YOUR VOICE ON TELEVISION BECAUSE 
WE HAD EXACTLY THE SAME FEELING HERE COME THE BRITS 
WE WERE VERY SUSPICIOUS OF YOU HERE YOU WERE 
TERRORISTS THAT WE WERE MEETING AND SLIGHTLY APPREHENSIVE 
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING 
WELL WE WERE MORE SUSPICIOUS OF YOU 
BECAUSE WE HAVE ALWAYS REGARDED BRITISH PRIME MINISTERS 
AS EVEN BIGGER TERRORISTS THAN MANY OF OURS ON THE ISLAND OF IRELAND 
NO PREVIOUS BRITISH PRIME MINISTER HAD EVER AGREED TO SHAKE HANDS WITH A SINN FEIN LEADER 
SO THERE WAS INTENSE SPECULATION ABOUT WHAT THE NEW PRIME MINISTER WOULD DO 
YOU DECIDED BEFOREHAND YOU WERE GOING TO SHAKE THEIR HANDS WHEREAS ALASTAIR AND I AND JOHN 
ALL REFUSED IN A RATHER PETTY WAY 
WHEN DID YOU DECIDE THAT YOU REALLY COULD DO BUSINESS WITH THEM 
FIRST OF ALL I THOUGHT NOT TO SHAKE THEIR HAND WAS JUST SORT OF 
RUDE REALLY RATHER THAN ANYTHING ELSE IT WAS AS MUCH A SORT OF 
YOU EITHER MEET PEOPLE OR YOU DON'T MEET THEM 
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS QUITE IMPORTANT ACTUALLY TO SHOW THAT AT A HUMAN LEVEL 
I REGARDED US AS EQUALS AND IN A SENSE THE SHAKING HANDS WAS AN ASPECT OF THAT 
BUT BLAIR'S RIGHT HAND MAN DID NOT FEEL THE SAME AS HIS BOSS 
THIRTEENTH OCTOBER NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN TONY SHOOK THEIR HANDS BUT I DID NOT 
IT WAS INTERESTING EYEBALLING MCGUINNESS AND SITTING NEXT TO ADAMS 
THEY WERE MUCH MORE ARTICULATE AND INTERESTING THAN MOST NORTHERN IRELAND POLITICIANS 
BUT DID YOU EVEN NOTICE THAT AT THE TIME NOT AT ALL YOU WERE MINIONS YOU SEE 
TONY WAS TONY WAS THE NUMBER ONE MAN 
AND IF HE FOUND IT WITHIN HIMSELF TO SHAKE HANDS 
IT REALLY DIDN'T MATTER A HOOT AS TO WHAT THE REST DID 
THE NEXT MONTH ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS 
CAME TO NUMBER TEN DOWNING STREET ITSELF 
POWELL'S ATTITUDE WAS ALREADY BECOMING MORE POSITIVE 
EVEN WHEN MARTIN MCGUINNESS APPEARED TO BRING UP THE SUBJECT OF THE I. R. A. ATTACK 
ON THE CABINET ROOM THAT HAD ALMOST KILLED POWELL'S OWN BROTHER 
WHEN MARTIN AND GERRY CAME IN THEY WENT TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE TABLE 
BEFORE THEY SAT DOWN THEY WERE LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM 
AND MARTIN SAID TO US SO THIS WAS WHERE ALL THE TROUBLE HAPPENED 
I ASSUMED THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE I. R. A. MORTAR ATTACK 
WHICH HAD DAMAGED THAT ROOM AND NEARLY KILLED THE IRAQ WAR CABINET 
SO I SAID YES THIS IS WHERE THE MORTARS CAME IN THEY LANDED IN THE GARDEN 
AND THE CABINET DIVED UNDER THE TABLE AND THEN ESCAPED FROM HERE 
HE LOOKED AT ME IN HORROR AND SAID NO I DIDN'T MEAN THAT AT ALL 
WHAT I WAS MEANT IS THIS WAS WHERE LLOYD GEORGE AND MICHAEL COLLINS 
SIGNED THE TREATY ON INDEPENDENCE WHICH STARTED THE WHOLE CIVIL WAR 
SO IT WAS BORNE HOME TO US ALMOST AT ONCE HOW THEY HAD A MUCH LONGER HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE THAN WE HAD 
THE EFFORTS TO WOO SINN FEIN BORE FRUIT 
IN APRIL NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT POWELL HIMSELF HELPED BROKER AN HISTORIC DEAL 
IN WHICH THE REPUBLICANS AGREED TO SHARE POLITICAL POWER WITH UNIONISTS 
WHO WANTED NORTHERN IRELAND TO STAY PART OF BRITAIN 
THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT SEEMED TO BE A DRAMATIC BREAKTHROUGH IN THE PEACE PROCESS 
BUT BEHIND THE TRIUMPHANT SCENES THERE WAS A BIG HIDDEN PROBLEM 
THE DEAL WAS DELIBERATELY UNCLEAR ON WHETHER THE I. R. A. WOULD BE OBLIGED TO 
GIVE UP THEIR WEAPONS BEFORE THE TWO SIDES ENTERED GOVERNMENT TOGETHER 
I THOUGHT THE GREAT GENIUS OF THE AGREEMENT 
WAS NOT TO MAKE THE ISSUE OF ARMS 
A PRECONDITION 
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS A CLEVER DIMENSION TO IT 
BUT AT THE CLIMAX OF THE NEGOTIATIONS 
TONY BLAIR HAD ASKED POWELL TO DELIVER A PERSONAL LETTER TO UNIONIST LEADER DAVID TRIMBLE 
IT GAVE HIM AN ASSURANCE THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT 
DID EXPECT THE I. R. A. TO SURRENDER ITS WEAPONS QUICKLY 
DAVID TRIMBLE TOOK THE LETTER AND SAID YES WE CAN GO WITH THAT 
RELIEF FINALLY WE HAD GOT SOMETHING THAT WAS GONNA MAKE THIS THING FLY 
THE ART OF NEGOTIATION IS ABOUT AMBIGUITY AND REACHING AGREEMENTS 
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD INVOLVES THAT SORT OF FACILITY 
WHICH DIPLOMATS ARE GOOD AT AND POLITICIANS ARE VERY GOOD AT 
IN SAYING THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE IN DIFFERENT WAYS 
BUT THE CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED FUDGE ON WEAPONS SOON DIDN'T LOOK SO CLEVER 
IN THE MONTHS AFTER THE AGREEMENT THE I. R. A. REFUSED TO GIVE UP ANY OF ITS ARSENAL 
DO YOU REMEMBER THE LETTER WE GOT AT THE TAIL END OF THE AGREEMENT 
WHICH HAD SAID IN THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW 
DECOMMISSIONING SHOULD START IN THE SUMMER 
AS SOON AS DECOMMISSIONING SCHEMES ARE IN PLACE 
AND THE QUESTIONS IS WHY DIDN'T THE GOVERNMENT STICK ON THAT AND ABSOLUTELY INSIST 
THAT WAS UPSETTING MY PEOPLE EVEN MORE 
THIS ADDED TO TENSION ON THE STREETS 
VIOLENCE BROKE OUT WHEN ORANGE PARADES WERE PREVENTED FROM MARCHING THROUGH CATHOLIC NEIGHBOURHOODS 
JONATHAN POWELL TRAVELLED TO NORTHERN IRELAND WITH TONY BLAIR TO TRY TO CALM THE TENSIONS 
BUT WHEN ONE ORANGEMAN CALLED BLAIR A LIAR 
THE SEASONED DIPLOMAT FOUND THAT EVEN HE COULD REACH THE END OF HIS TETHER 
THERE WAS ANOTHER MEETING WE HAD WITH THE ORANGE ORDER 
A PARTICULARLY TENSE MOMENT ON DRUMCREE AND WE HAD ALL OF THEM LINED ROUND THE TABLE 
YOU HAD TO BE PHYSICALLY RESTRAINED BY ME FROM ASSAULTING THAT BLOKE WHO DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED 
I THINK IN TERMS OF THE INSULT HE PAID ME IT WAS A PRETTY LIGHT INSULT GIVEN MOST OF THE INSULTS I GOT 
BUT ANYWAY I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU LIKE THAT 
YOU SUDDENLY LEAPT UP AND STARTED LEANING ACROSS THE TABLE AT HIM 
SO I HAD TO PHYSICALLY RESTRAIN YOU 
AND WHAT DID YOU TELL ME ABOUT LOSING YOUR TEMPER IN PUBLIC 
I THINK I SAID YOU MUST NEVER LOSE YOUR TEMPER IN PUBLIC EXCEPT ON PURPOSE 
YES EXCEPT ON PURPOSE THAT'S RIGHT 
I'D BEEN IN THE FOREIGN OFFICE FOR SIXTEEN YEARS 
MOST OF THAT TIME I'D SPENT DOING NEGOTIATIONS 
I'D DONE THE HONG KONG HANDOVER TALKS WITH THE CHINESE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTIES 
VERY FRAUGHT NEGOTIATIONS 
TRYING TO WORK OUT EXACTLY THE TERMS ON WHICH HONG KONG WOULD RETURN TO CHINA 
I NEGOTIATED GERMAN UNIFICATION AS PART OF THE BRITISH TEAM TO THE TWO PLUS FOUR NEGOTIATIONS 
I'D NEGOTIATED WITH THE RUSSIANS ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND ARMS CONTROL 
SO I'D DONE THE CLASSIC DIPLOMATIC NEGOTIATIONS INCLUDING WITH SOME EXTREMELY UNREASONABLE PEOPLE 
LIKE THE FORMER SOVIET UNION AND THE CHINESE REGIME AT THE TIME 
SO I WAS USED TO NEGOTIATING WITH TOUGH INTERLOCUTORS 
BUT NORTHERN IRELAND WAS SOMETHING ELSE AGAIN 
WHERE THE DEGREE OF UNREASONABLENESS THAT COULD BE FOUND ON BOTH SIDES 
IS PROBABLY UNPARALLELED ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD 
ONLY A YEAR AFTER THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT NORTHERN IRELAND'S FRAGILE PEACE WAS UNDER THREAT 
NOW POWELL RETURNED IN EARNEST TO HIS UNDERCOVER MISSION 
TO PERSUADE REPUBLICANS TO GIVE UP THEIR WEAPONS 
HE WAS FACED WITH A SERIES OF DILEMMAS 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO TALK TO PEOPLE WHO ARE TERRORISTS 
WHO HAVE A PARAMILITARY MOVEMENT BEHIND THEM 
YOU'RE ALMOST INEVITABLY IN THAT CONUNDRUM THAT YOU'RE TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO COULD 
IF THEY WANTED TO GO BACK TO VIOLENCE 
THE ALTERNATIVE IS NOT TALKING TO THEM WHICH DOESN'T GET YOU VERY FAR 
POWELL AND TONY BLAIR DECIDED THEY HAD TO GET TO KNOW THE LEADERS OF SINN FEIN MUCH BETTER 
AS WELL AS POWELL'S SECRET TRIPS TO NORTHERN IRELAND 
ADAMS AND MCGUINESS MADE FREQUENT VISITS TO DOWNING STREET UNNOTICED BY THE PRESS 
JUST APPROACHING THE BACK DOOR OF DOWNING STREET 
THESE ARE THE GATES THROUGH WHICH THEY WOULD WHISK 
WE'D WHISK THEM UP HERE 
THE BOLLARDS WOULD BE DOWN THE POLICE WOULD BE EXPECTING THEM 
AND THEY'D WHISK UP THERE THE CAMERAS WOULDN'T SEE THEM 
BECAUSE THE CAMERAS WOULD BE RIGHT UP THERE UP THE STEPS 
THEY'D SLIP THROUGH THAT DOOR WE HAD SOMEONE WAITING 
TO TAKE THEM UP TO THE STUDY OR THE DEN AND WE'D MEET THERE 
I REMEMBER ONE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS WHERE 
YOU SUDDENLY CAME THROUGH AND SAID 
ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS ARE SKATEBOARDING WITH YOUR CHILDREN OUTSIDE 
AND I DASHED OUT INTO THE BACK GARDEN OF DOWNING STREET AND NICKY AND EWAN 
WERE GIVING THEM LESSONS ON HOW TO USE THE SKATEBOARD SO 
I SAID TO THEM AFTERWARDS DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT WAS AND THEY SAID YEAH THEY SEEMED QUITE NICE 
O. K. THANKS 
AS YOU BEGIN TO GET TO KNOW SOMEONE RATHER THAN A CARICATURE 
YOU DISCOVER DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THEIR PERSONALITY DIFFERENT HUMAN FEELINGS 
YOU CAN THEN BEGIN TO RELATE TO IT AND YOU CAN BEGIN TO 
ESTABLISH TRUST BELIEVE WHAT THEY SAY AND TRY AND WORK WITH THEM 
MARTIN'S VERY HUMAN VERY EMOTIONAL 
HE CAN GET CARRIED AWAY IN FLIGHTS OF FANCY FOR WHICH HE'D BE GENTLY MOCKED BY GERRY ADAMS 
ADAMS WAS COOLER AND MORE RATIONAL 
WE EVEN DISCOVERED HE'S A TREE HUGGER HE LOVES GOING AROUND PUTTING HIS ARMS AROUND TREES 
AND COMMUNING WITH THEM WHICH WAS SOMETHING MARTIN MCGUINNESS LIKED TO TEASE HIM ABOUT MERCILESSLY 
DO YOU LIKE MARTIN MCGUINESS YES IF YOU WERE HAVING A DINNER PARTY 
MARTIN MCGUINESS OR GERRY ADAMS ARE THE PEOPLE YOU WOULD WANT TO INVITE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH 
THEY'D BE SOMEONE INTERESTING THAT YOU COULD ENJOY A CONVERSATION WITH DESPITE THEIR PAST 
WHAT WOULD THEY BRING TO A DINNER PARTY 
HOPEFULLY A BOTTLE OF WINE RATHER THAN A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL 
POWELL'S DIARY REVEALS THAT DESPITE ALL THE CHUMMINESS THE TALKS OFTEN HAD A SINISTER EDGE 
THIS IS AN ENTRY FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS 
WEDNESDAY THIRTY JUNE SUNDAY FOUR JULY 
THE NIGHTMARE CONTINUED 
SINN FEIN STARTED BRINGING IN MORE AND MORE HEAVY FIGURES 
AT ONE STAGE THEY STARTED TO GET REALLY THREATENING 
THEY WOULD GO BACK TO VIOLENCE IF WE DIDN'T SORT IT OUT 
THURSDAY TWENTY SECOND JULY 
ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS TURNED UP IN THE EVENING 
THEY TOOK A VERY HARD LINE 
MARTIN MCGUINNESS IN PARTICULAR WAS VERY THREATENING TO TONY 
IT'S SURPRISING HOW STARK THE THREAT SEEMS AND QUITE HOW STARKLY I'VE RECORDED IT 
OF COURSE IT'S VERY CRYPTIC AND VERY SHORTHAND 
BUT THEY WERE CLEARLY IN THIS PERIOD OF NINETEEN NINETY NINE TRYING TO TEST US 
SINN FEIN WOULD NOT CONDONE A RETURN TO VIOLENCE BUT THEY OFTEN SUGGESTED THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE 
TO CONTROL I. R. A. HARDLINERS WITHIN THEIR OWN MOVEMENT OR REPUBLICAN SPLINTER GROUPS LIKE THE REAL I. R. A. 
WE MADE THE CASE TO YOU MANY MANY TIMES THAT IF THERE ARE BRITISH SOLDIERS IN REPUBLICAN HEARTLANDS 
AND EVEN IF THEY'RE JUST BY THEIR PRESENCE THERE THAT'S OFFENSIVE TO THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE 
BUT IF THEY BEHAVE AS BRITISH SOLDIERS INVARIABLY DO IN THESE SITUATIONS 
BECAUSE THEY FEEL UNDER THREAT AND THEY'RE ON ALIEN TERRITORY AND SO ON 
THEREFORE IF THEY STOP PEOPLE OR ABUSE PEOPLE AND SO ON 
YOU'RE JUST A STEP BACK FROM FROM VIOLENCE AT ALL TIMES 
NOT PERHAPS OF A PLANNED NATURE 
BUT AS SOME FAMOUS BRITISH POLITICIAN WHOSE NAME I CAN'T REMEMBER SAID ONCE 
EVENTS DEAR BOYS 
I THINK THE PROOF OF THAT WAS THE OMAGH BOMB 
I MEAN WHO COULD PREDICT IT 
THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE SHARPENED THE DILEMMAS POWELL FACED IN NEGOTIATING WITH SINN FEIN 
THE DIFFICULT THING SOMETIMES WAS KNOWING WHERE THE LINE WAS 
BETWEEN THE UNTRUTH AND THE BLARNEY IF YOU LIKE 
THAT WHEN THEY WERE TRYING TO PUSH YOU INTO A NEGOTIATING POSITION 
HOW DO YOU DETERMINE REALLY WHERE THEIR BOTTOM LINE WAS 
SOMETHING WE REALISED RELATIVELY EARLY ON WAS REPUBLICANS WERE CHISELLERS 
THEY WOULD CONSTANTLY NEGOTIATE AND WOULD CONSTANTLY TRY AND GET A BIT MORE HERE AND A BIT MORE THERE 
AND I THINK THE VIEW WE TOOK WAS THAT THE PRIZE WAS SO GREAT 
GETTING DECOMMISSIONING GETTING THIS PEACE PROCESS UP 
GETTING THE EXECUTIVE UP AND RUNNING IT WAS WORTH MAKING CONCESSIONS ON OTHER ISSUES 
I NEVER SAW IT I HAVE TO SAY 
AS YOU KNOW US WRINGING CONCESSIONS OUT OF THE BRITS 
WHERE WE COME WITH THIS FROM A POSITION OF MORAL SUPERIORITY 
IS THAT THIS IS OUR COUNTRY AND WE LIVE HERE 
THE DEALS WERE METICULOUSLY NEGOTIATED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS 
BUT THE CONCESSIONS THEY PRODUCED HIT THE HEADLINES 
IN NORTHERN IRELAND THE FIRST CONVICTED TERRORISTS TO BE RELEASED 
EARLY FROM PRISON UNDER THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT HAVE LEFT PRISON 
BRITISH ARMY WATCHTOWERS WERE ALSO DEMOLISHED 
IT WAS CALLED DEMILITARISATION 
BUT EVEN PETER MANDELSON TONY BLAIR'S NORTHERN IRELAND SECRETARY AT THE TIME 
HAD SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT POWELL'S BARGAINING TACTICS 
WHAT I FELT ABOUT THAT AT THE TIME WAS FIRST OF ALL WHETHER THE TOKEN 
DECOMMISSIONING WE WERE GOING TO GET FROM THEM WAS WORTH THE PRICE 
SECONDLY WHEN YOU MAKE THOSE CONCESSIONS AND MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS 
YOU RUN A VERY BIG RISK OF DESTABILISING THE OTHER PARTIES 
I MEAN BOTH THE UNIONISTS UNDER DAVID TRIMBLE AND OF COURSE 
THE NATIONALIST S. D. L. P. BOTH OF WHOM HATED EQUALLY THIS IDEA THAT WE WERE PAYING THE PEOPLE WITH GUNS 
TO DO WHAT THEY BY RIGHTS SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY UNDER THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT 
IT LOOKED TO MODERATE NORTHERN IRISH POLITICIANS THAT POWELL AND BLAIR WERE ALLOWING SINN FEIN 
TO USE THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE TO SQUEEZE OUT POLITICAL CONCESSIONS 
TONY BLAIR STATED QUITE EMPHATICALLY TO US 
AND I QUOTE HIM EXACTLY I CHECKED IT BEFORE I CAME HE SAID 
YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM WITH YOU GUYS 
YOU DON'T HAVE GUNS 
THAT'S WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER'S ATTITUDE WAS 
NOW TAKE THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION OF THAT THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION OF THAT 
IS IF YOU WANT TO GET ANYWHERE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH MY GOVERNMENT 
THEN YOU HAVE TO BE CARRYING GUNS 
I HAD A LOT OF SYMPATHY WITH THEM BUT IF YOU ARE TRYING TO MAKE PROGRESS IN A NEGOTIATION 
YOU NEED TO HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE PEOPLE WHO IN THE END CAN DELIVER 
THERE'S NO POINT TALKING TO THE S. D. L. P. ABOUT GIVING UP WEAPONS COS THEY HAVEN'T GOT ANY 
POWELL'S BIG PROBLEM WAS THAT HIS UNDERCOVER DIPLOMACY 
WAS FAILING TO DELIVER A BREAKTHROUGH ON I. R. A. WEAPONS 
TONY BLAIR HIMSELF BECAME DEEPLY DEPRESSED ABOUT FINDING PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
MONDAY FOURTEEN JUNE 
WROTE A RATHER TOUGH SPEECH ON NORTHERN IRELAND 
TONY IS REALLY FED UP WITH THEM 
TUESDAY TWENTY SECOND JUNE 
TONY IS VERY DEPRESSED ABOUT NORTHERN IRELAND 
IN FACT HE HAS GOT PRACTICALLY CHILDISH ABOUT IT AND IS THREATENING NEVER TO GO BACK THERE 
WEDNESDAY TWENTY THIRD JUNE 
TONY CONTINUES VERY TIRED AND DEPRESSED ABOUT NORTHERN IRELAND 
I WAS LONG TERM OPTIMISTIC IN THE BROADEST SENSE 
BUT THERE WERE TIMES CERTAINLY DURING THE TEN YEARS 
WHEN I FELT WE WOULDN'T DO THE DEAL 
BLAIR'S FORLORN HOPE WAS THAT POWELL'S INCREASINGLY CLOSE BOND 
WITH ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS MIGHT PROVIDE THE KEY 
I THINK AS TIME PROGRESSED AS TIME MOVED ON AND AS WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER 
IT IS CERTAINLY MY VIEW THAT BOTH TONY AND YOURSELF REALISED THAT YOU WERE DEALING WITH 
VERY SERIOUS PEOPLE WHO WERE PREPARED TO DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER 
TO ENSURE THAT THE SITUATION WOULD NOT SLIP BACK TO ONE OF CONFLICT 
ONE WEEKEND IN NOVEMBER NINETEEN NINETY NINE POWELL'S PHONE STARTED RINGING OFF THE HOOK 
I STARTED GETTING CALLS AT HOME ON THE SATURDAY FROM MARTIN MCGUINNESS 
THEN FROM GERRY ADAMS HIMSELF SAYING THINGS WERE GOING VERY BADLY 
AND THEY NEEDED FURTHER CONCESSIONS FROM US 
AND HE ASKED FOR A SERIES OF DIFFERENT CONCESSIONS ON PRISONERS ON THE RUN AND VARIOUS OTHER THINGS 
AND I SPOKE TO TONY AND WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO MAKE THESE CONCESSIONS 
POWELL'S HOPE WAS THAT FURTHER CONCESSIONS 
WOULD HELP ADAMS PERSUADE THE I. R. A. TO GIVE UP THEIR WEAPONS 
ADAMS WAS NOW ON HIS WAY TO MEET THE I. R. A. LEADERSHIP 
I REMEMBER ADAMS CALLING ME AGAIN AND HE WAS VERY 
IT WAS A STRANGE PHONE CALL HE WAS BOTH VERY FRIENDLY AND ALSO SLIGHTLY THREATENING 
AND HIS VOICE WAS VERY 
THERE WAS A VERY DEEP TIMBRE TO IT AND YOU KNEW WHAT HE WAS SAYING 
AND OBVIOUSLY IT WAS THE WAY HE MANAGED TO GET HIS WAY ON OTHER THINGS IN OTHER FORA 
AND EVENTUALLY TONY AGREED THAT WE SHOULD SEND ANOTHER LETTER 
MAKING THESE FURTHER CONCESSIONS TOWARDS SINN FEIN 
I CALLED ADAMS I REMEMBER IT WAS DARK 
I CAN'T REMEMBER HOW LATE IN THE EVENING IT WAS 
AND I GOT HOLD OF HIM ON HIS MOBILE PHONE AS HE WAS DRIVING DOWN TOWARDS THE BORDER 
TO GO AND HAVE A MEETING PRESUMABLY WITH THE I. R. A. ARMY COUNCIL 
HE LISTENED ON THIS CRACKLY LINE AS I READ THE LETTER TO HIM 
AND HE WAS OBVIOUSLY WRITING IT DOWN IN THE BACK OF THE CAR 
AND THEN AT A CERTAIN POINT JUST AS I GOT TO THE END OF THE LETTER THE PHONE WENT DEAD 
AND HE'D OBVIOUSLY CROSSED THE BORDER AND GONE OUT OF RANGE ON HIS MOBILE 
THEN I TRIED CALLING HIM BACK BUT GOT NOWHERE AND COULDN'T GET HIM FOR ANOTHER TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
PRESUMABLY HE'D SWITCHED OFF HIS MOBILE FOR SECURITY REASONS TO ATTEND HIS MEETING 
SO WE COULDN'T TRACK WHERE IT WAS 
ADAMS HAD SPENT MANY HOURS TALKING TO THE I. R. A. ARMY COUNCIL 
NOW POWELL WAITED FOR HIM TO COME BACK ONTO THE RADAR 
I REMEMBER WELL THE CALL I GOT FROM GERRY ADAMS 
AFTER ALL THESE MEETINGS AT THE WEEKEND WHERE WE HAD BEEN PROVIDING ALL THE LETTERS 
TO HELP HIM GET OVER THE HUMP 
HE CALLED ME AND SAID JONATHAN WE'VE GOT LIFT OFF AT THIS END 
ADAMS PHRASE LIFT OFF MEANT THAT THE I. R. A. WERE NOW 
PREPARED TO START DISCUSSIONS ABOUT GIVING UP THEIR WEAPONS 
BUT DAVID TRIMBLE THE UNIONIST LEADER 
QUICKLY DEMANDED MORE CONCRETE PROGRESS ON DECOMMISSIONING 
BLAIR AND POWELL BACKED TRIMBLE BY SAYING THEY WOULD SUSPEND NORTHERN IRELAND'S NEW ASSEMBLY AT STORMONT 
AND GOVERN ONCE AGAIN FROM LONDON UNLESS THERE WAS A BREAKTHROUGH 
THIS PUT THEM ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH THEIR PARTNERS IN THE PEACE PROCESS THE IRISH GOVERNMENT 
THE IRISH LEADER BERTIE AHERN AND HIS CABINET SECRETARY THOUGHT THE BREAKTHROUGH ON WEAPONS WOULD COME 
IF ONLY BLAIR AND PETER MANDELSON WOULD HOLD BACK FROM SUSPENSION 
THERE WAS A SPARKY PHONE CALL BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND BERTIE AHERN 
WHICH TURNED INTO A PHONE CALL BETWEEN PADDY TEAHON AND THE PRIME MINISTER DO YOU REMEMBER 
THERE WAS A WONDERFUL PHONE CALL ON THE EVENING OF THE SUSPENSION 
AS USUAL THE PRIME MINISTER WAS IN DOWNING STREET OBVIOUSLY 
BUT AS USUAL AS THE NUMBER TEN SWITCHBOARD WOULD DO HABITUALLY 
THEY WOULD PLUG IN THE PRIVATE SECRETARY THE CHIEF OF STAFF 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND 
AND I WAS DULY PLUGGED IN SILENTLY AND ANONYMOUSLY TO THIS CALL 
FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW 
ONE THING WE WERE NEVER FOUND WANTING ON WAS A STRAIGHT DEAL 
AND WE TRIED TO DEAL STRAIGHT AND I THINK OUR TEMPERS FLARED A BIT 
WHEN WE FOUND THAT IT WASN'T ALL QUITE STRAIGHT 
FIRST OF ALL BERTIE AHERN SORT OF LET RIP AT MY ACTION 
AS HE THOUGHT IT WAS MY ACTION 
AND THEN HE SAID AND IF YOU CAN'T TAKE THIS FROM ME JUST TAKE THIS FROM PADDY TEAHON 
AND HE GAVE THE PHONE TO PADDY TEAHON 
I'D SAY MY BLOOD PRESSURE WAS SOMETHING LIKE ABOUT 
ONE THOUSAND OR ABOUT THREE HUNDRED 
IT SOUNDED WORSE THAN THAT I TELL YOU 
THE PRIME MINISTER SAID PADDY ARE YOU O. K. 
AND I SAID NO PRIME MINISTER I AM NOT O. K. AND IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL PETER MANDELSON WILL 
AND I THINK I MIGHT HAVE UTTERED VERY UNCIVIL SERVICE LIKE LANGUAGE 
ABOUT MY VIEW OF WHAT PETER MANDELSON WAS ABOUT TO DO 
AN EXTREME OF ABUSE POURED DOWN THE TELEPHONE ABOUT ME 
WHAT I DIDN'T REALISE OF COURSE 
WAS THAT PETER MANDELSON WAS LISTENING IN ON THE PHONE CALL IN BELFAST 
IT WAS CERTAINLY A VERY ODD SENSATION TO HEAR YOURSELF 
SO BRUTALLY DENOUNCED WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO OPEN YOUR MOUTH IN DEFENCE 
ON ELEVENTH FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND MANDELSON WENT AHEAD AND SUSPENDED THE ASSEMBLY 
POWELL'S HANDIWORK LAY IN RUINS 
TO LOSE IT AT THE BEGINNING OF TWO THOUSAND WAS CATASTROPHIC 
WE WEREN'T SURE WE WOULD EVER BE ABLE TO GET IT UP AGAIN 
I WASN'T ANGRY WITH ANYONE ABOUT THIS IT WASN'T THE FAULT OF EITHER SIDE 
WE JUST COULDN'T MAKE THE TWO PIECES JOIN UP IT WAS A FRUSTRATION RATHER THAN AN ANGER 
POWELL'S DIARY REVEALS THAT IN THE FOLLOWING MONTHS VIOLENCE THREATENED TO RETURN 
MONDAY THIRTEENTH MARCH TWO THOUSAND 
ADAMS DELIVERED A FAIRLY STARK MESSAGE 
ABOUT THE WAR BEING ON AGAIN TO THE IRISH AND TO PETER 
TONY INSISTS THAT WE FILL THE VACUUM THE VIOLENCE MAY RECOMMENCE EARLIER THAN WE THINK 
GERRY ADAMS CALLED UP IN THE AFTERNOON TO THREATEN US WITH WAR AGAIN 
UNLESS A NEW WAY THROUGH IT COULD BE FOUND THE IMPASSE ON I. R. A. WEAPONS 
THREATENED TO DESTROY THE ENTIRE PEACE PROCESS 
ONLY A MONTH AFTER THE SUSPENSION ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS WERE BACK IN DOWNING STREET 
OFFICIAL NEGOTIATIONS WERE STALLED BUT POWELL'S PRIVATE LINE OF COMMUNICATION 
WAS ABOUT TO TAKE AN INTERESTING TURN 
WE'D HAD A MEETING TONY AND MARTIN MCGUINNESS AND GERRY ADAMS AND I HAD HAD A MEETING IN HIS DEN 
WE HAD GONE ROUND AND ROUND IN CIRCLES ABOUT DECOMMISSIONING AND HADN'T GOT ANYWHERE 
AFTER WE'D FINISHED I WALKED OUT WITH GERRY ADAMS AND MARTIN AND THEIR DELEGATION 
AND ER ADAMS 
USHERED HIS DELEGATION OUT TOWARDS THE FRONT DOOR AND BECKONED ME 
TO COME INTO THE GENTS WITH HIM ON THE GROUND FLOOR JUST OUTSIDE TONY'S OFFICE SO I FOLLOWED HIM IN 
WONDERING WHAT ON EARTH HE WAS BECKONING ME IN THERE FOR 
HE PROPOSED THAT I COME OVER TO NORTHERN IRELAND 
TO DISCUSS WITH HIM THE IDEA OF DUMPING WEAPONS 
I GUESS HE THOUGHT THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY EARS LISTENING IN THE GENTS 
THAT IT WOULDN'T BE BUGGED AND THERE WOULDN'T BE PEOPLE FROM HIS DELEGATION LISTENING IN 
WEAPONS DUMPING WAS AN ALTERNATIVE TO DESTROYING WEAPONS 
THE ARMS WOULD BE LOCKED AWAY IN SECRET LOCATIONS KNOWN ONLY TO INDEPENDENT MONITORS 
WITHIN WEEKS POWELL WAS IN WEST BELFAST 
ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS STILL FEARED THAT IF BRITAIN'S SECURITY SERVICES KNEW ABOUT POWELL'S NEGOTIATIONS 
THEY WOULD USE THE INFORMATION TO UNDERMINE SINN FEIN 
POWELL WENT BACK UNDERCOVER 
THERE WERE PEOPLE WITHIN THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WITHIN THE SECUROCRATIC ADMINISTRATION 
WHO WERE HOSTILE TO THE SINN FEIN PROJECT WHO I SUPPOSE FOR SOME OF THEM 
WERE NOT PREPARED TO FATHOM THE NEGOTIATING PROCESS 
WITH PEOPLE WHO THEY CONSIDERED TO BE PEOPLE THAT HAD NEVER BEEN MILITARILY DEFEATED 
SO I THINK ALL OF THOSE HANG UPS WERE CLEARLY THERE 
IT WAS JUST AROUND HERE WE CAME IN PAST THIS GYPSY ENCAMPMENT I REMEMBER THAT 
THEN WE CAME DOWN HERE AND WE TURNED INTO THE LITTLE ESTATE 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN THIS ONE JUST GO LEFT HERE 
YES I THINK IT WAS IT WAS UP HERE 
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE HOUSES HERE WITH THE SHUTTERS THE BLINDS ON THE BAY WINDOW 
WHAT CONVERSATIONS WHERE YOU HAVING HERE 
I CAME HERE AND I REMEMBER THEY DROPPED ME OFF HERE 
DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE CAR JUST LET ME GET OUT AND KNOCKED ON THE DOOR AND ADAMS OPENED THAT DOOR 
HE DIDN'T COME OUT HIMSELF HE JUST OPENED THE DOOR AND I WENT IN 
MCGUINNESS WAS IN THERE TOO 
STUFFING THEIR FACES WITH THESE HUGE SANDWICHES DOORSTEP SANDWICHES 
ADAMS VERY KINDLY OFFERED ME HALF HIS TUNA SANDWICH WHICH I DECLINED 
THEN WE GOT DOWN TO BUSINESS 
I DESCRIBED TO THEM THE VARIOUS OPTIONS I COULD SEE FOR DUMPING WEAPONS 
I WENT THROUGH THEM ALL AND THEY LISTENED CAREFULLY AND TOOK NOTES 
AND SAID THERE'S NO WAY THE I. R. A. CAN DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS COMPLETELY HOPELESS 
POWELL AGAIN AND AGAIN REPEATED THE CASE FOR WEAPONS DUMPING 
I CAME OVER SEVERAL TIMES FOR SECRET MEETINGS WITH GERRY ADAMS 
AND MARTIN MCGUINNESS IN HOUSES ROUND HERE IN WEST BELFAST 
I USED TO BE DRIVEN AROUND BY SIOBHAN O'HANLON WHO WAS AN AIDE TO GERRY ADAMS WHO WAS 
REPUTED TO HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF AN ACTIVE SERVICE UNIT AND A DEDICATED TERRORIST 
BUT HAD BECOME A VERY EFFECTIVE LIEUTENANT 
SHE USED TO DRIVE ME EVERYWHERE 
I REMEMBER ONE TIME SHE WAS DRIVING ME SOMEWHERE ROUND HERE 
SHE HAD HER HUSBAND IN THE CAR THAT TIME 
I WAS CLUTCHING MY OFFICIAL BRIEFCASE AND HE TOLD ME HE'D BEEN ONE OF THE HUNGER STRIKERS 
WHICH MADE ME FEEL A BIT DAFT 
A BRITISH OFFICIAL BEING DRIVEN AROUND BY A HUNGER STRIKER 
THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE FRUSTRATING 
ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS HAD A PARTICULAR STYLE OF NEGOTIATING THEY WOULD ER 
SHOW A BIT OF ANKLE AT THE BEGINNING SO YOU WOULD GET INTERESTED AND THINK YOU WERE MAKING PROGRESS 
THEN YOU HAD TO GO FOR A VERY HARD GRIND OF NEGOTIATION WHERE YOU WENT AT GREAT LENGTH INTO ENORMOUS 
DETAIL ON ALL SORTS OF ISSUES AND THEN JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU'D GOT AN AGREEMENT 
AND YOU'D GOT THERE THEY WOULD THROW A HUGE BUCKET OF COLD WATER OVER YOU 
AND MAKE YOU THINK THERE WAS NO HOPE OF REACHING AN AGREEMENT AT ALL 
SO YOU WERE PATHETICALLY GRATEFUL AT THE END IF YOU DID GET AN AGREEMENT EVEN IF ON A REDUCED BASIS 
EVENTUALLY POWELL HAD SOME LIMITED SUCCESS 
IN WINTER TWO THOUSAND ONE AND SPRING TWO THOUSAND TWO THE I. R. A. DID DUMP SOME OF ITS WEAPONS 
AS ALWAYS WITH NORTHERN IRELAND WHEN IT LOOKED GOOD ON THE SURFACE 
I KNEW THAT UNDERNEATH THE FOUNDATIONS WERE CRUMBLING 
GOOD EVENING THE NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE PROCESS IS ON A KNIFE EDGE TONIGHT 
AFTER POLICE TOOK THE UNPRECEDENTED STEP OF RAIDING SINN FEIN'S OFFICES AT STORMONT 
THEY WERE INVESTIGATING ALLEGATIONS ABOUT A REPUBLICAN SPYING OPERATION 
THERE HAD BEEN MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT THE I. R. A. HAD NOT CEASED PARAMILITARY ACTIVITY 
WHEN IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND TWO THE POLICE RAIDED THE PARLIAMENTARY OFFICES OF SINN FEIN THEY FOUND EVIDENCE 
THAT INTELLIGENCE WAS STILL BEING GATHERED TO TARGET VICTIMS FOR TERRORIST ATTACK 
THE WEEK OF THE COLLAPSE OF THE NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE PROCESS 
ADAMS DISAPPEARED AS HE ALWAYS DOES AT MOMENTS OF DIFFICULTY 
THERE WAS A REAL DANGER OF THE PROCESS BECOMING DISCREDITED 
WE WERE PRETENDING THAT WE HAD A PROPER PEACE PROCESS WHEN VIOLENCE WAS CONTINUING TO GO ON 
IT WASN'T REALITY AND WE WERE THEREFORE BECOMING DISCREDITED OURSELVES 
BECAUSE WE WERE TRYING TO PRESENT THINGS AS WE WISHED THEM TO BE RATHER THAN AS THEY REALLY WERE 
AND WE COULDN'T SUSTAIN THE PEACE PROCESS ON THAT BASIS 
UP TILL NOW BLAIR AND POWELL HAD TRODDEN SOFTLY IN PUBLIC MESSAGES 
TO THE REPUBLICAN MOVEMENT BUT THEY FELT THEY WERE LEFT WITH NO ALTERNATIVE 
POWELL HELPED DRAFT A NEW HARD LINE FROM BLAIR 
I SPENT SOME OF THE MORNING FIDDLING WITH TONY'S SPEECH ON NORTHERN IRELAND 
IT'S VERY GOOD 
TELLS IT LIKE IT IS 
THE VERY THING 
REPUBLICANS USED TO THINK GAVE THEM NEGOTIATING LEVERAGE 
DOESN'T DO IT ANY MORE 
BLAIR TOOK A RISKY STEP HE WOULD FORCE REPUBLICANS INTO A CHOICE 
GIVE UP WEAPONS AND VIOLENCE ALTOGETHER OR GO BACK TO WAR 
THE FORK IN THE ROAD HAS FINALLY COME 
WE'D BEEN VERY NERVOUS ABOUT ALL THE REACTIONS TO THE SPEECH BECAUSE WE HADN'T TESTED IT OUT ON PEOPLE 
AND PARTICULARLY OBVIOUSLY WORRIED ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN REACTION BECAUSE WE IT COULD HAVE BEEN 
SUFFICIENTLY STARK TO PUSH THEM OUT OF THE GAME ALTOGETHER AND RETURN TO VIOLENCE 
A DECADE BEFORE WHEN THE I. R. A. WAS CONFRONTED 
IN SIMILAR FASHION BY JOHN MAJOR THEY HAD ENDED THEIR CEASEFIRE 
AND BOMBED CANARY WHARF 
POWELL WAS KEENLY AWARE OF THE RISKS 
FOR DAYS AFTER BLAIR'S SPEECH HE HEARD NOTHING 
THEN GERRY ADAMS FINALLY CONTACTED POWELL AND MADE A REQUEST THAT ASTONISHED HIM 
FRIDAY TWENTY FIVE OCTOBER ADAMS CALLED ME YESTERDAY AND ASKED ME FOR IDEAS FOR HIS BIG SPEECH ON SATURDAY 
POWELL REPLIED WITH MORE THAN IDEAS 
HE EMAILED ADAMS A TEXT 
I TRIED TO PUT MYSELF IN A REPUBLICAN FRAME OF MIND AND DRAFT IT IN REPUBLICAN SPEAK 
ADAMS DOES NOT DENY THAT HIS VITAL SPEECH WAS DRAFTED BY AN OFFICIAL OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT 
I DO RECALL US EXCHANGING DRAFTS AND TEXTS 
WE ASKED POWELL TO READ ADAMS THE WORDS HE WROTE FOR HIM 
THE I. R. A. IS NEVER GOING TO DISBAND IN RESPONSE TO ULTIMATUMS FROM THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT OR DAVID TRIMBLE 
THE I. R. A. IS NEVER GOING TO DISBAND IN RESPONSE TO ULTIMATUMS FROM THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT OR DAVID TRIMBLE 
I DO BELIEVE THE LOGIC OF THE PEACE PROCESS PUTS US ALL IN A DIFFERENT PLACE 
BUT I DO BELIEVE THE LOGIC OF THE PEACE PROCESS PUTS ALL OF US IN A DIFFERENT PLACE 
POWELL ALSO GAVE ADAMS THE WORDS THAT BLAIR AND POWELL WANTED TO HEAR MOST OF ALL 
WORDS THAT ADAMS HAD UP TILL NOW CLAIMED HIS AUDIENCE WERE SIMPLY NOT PREPARED TO HEAR 
IF YOU ASK ME DO I ENVISAGE A FUTURE WITHOUT THE I. R. A. THE ANSWER IS OBVIOUS 
THE ANSWER IS YES 
WELL I COULDN'T DECIDE WHETHER TO SUE HIM FOR PLAGIARISM OR THROW MY HAT IN THE AIR IN DELIGHT 
NOW POWELL WENT BACK UNDERCOVER TO A DIFFERENT KIND OF SAFE HOUSE A HOUSE OF GOD 
ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS FEARED THAT ON THE STREETS OF WEST BELFAST 
POWELL MIGHT NOW BE A TARGET FOR DISSIDENT REPUBLICANS 
CLONARD MONASTERY SERVES THE CATHOLICS OF WEST BELFAST 
AS WELL AS PROVIDING SPIRITUAL SUPPORT CLONARD HAS PLAYED A VITAL POLITICAL ROLE 
TWENTY YEARS AGO IT WAS HERE THAT SINN FEIN 
FIRST MET WITH MODERATE NATIONALISTS AND THEN EVEN MORE SECRETLY MEMBERS OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT 
IN TWO THOUSAND THREE POWELL CAME HERE TOO 
FATHER ADRIAN EGAN SHARED HIS MEMORIES OF THOSE MEETINGS WITH POWELL 
I DO REMEMBER GERRY ADAMS BRINGING ME DOWN HERE ONE TIME OR UP HERE ONE TIME TO SEE THE SHANKILL ROAD 
HE SAID YOU COULD SEE IT FROM THE END HERE 
THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN SEE IT 
AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES HERE 
BACK IN SIXTY NINE THAT HOUSE ACROSS THE WAY A YOUNG FIFTEEN YEAR OLD GERALD MCAULEY 
WAS SHOT DEAD HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO DIE IN THE TROUBLES 
I DO REMEMBER ONE OF THE MEETINGS THAT YOU WERE ALL HERE GOVERNMENTS AND SINN FEIN 
YOU WERE MEETING IN SEPARATE ROOMS 
BUT YOU ALL CAME TOGETHER FOR LUNCH 
ALL OF YOU WERE SITTING IN HERE 
A PARTICULAR THING I REMEMBER MY WATCH THE MINUTE HAND ON MY WATCH HAD GOT LOOSE 
I WAS TERRIFIED I WAS GOING TO MISS MY PLANE I WAS WAVING IT AROUND LIKE THIS 
MARTIN MCGUINNESS SAID TO ME I'LL TAKE IT TO BE FIXED AT A LITTLE WATCH SHOP AT THE END OF MY STREET 
I SAID NO PLEASE DON'T TAKE IT DON'T TAKE IT AWAY 
BUT HE DID AND HE BROUGHT IT BACK TO ME AT LEEDS CASTLE 
I WAS VERY GRATEFUL EXCEPT THAT OF COURSE 
I HAD TO GIVE IT TO THE SECURICRATS WHO THEN TOOK IT TO PIECES TO SEE IF THERE WAS A BUG OR TRAP IN IT 
I DON'T BELIEVE FOR ONE MINUTE THAT YOU GAVE IT TO THE SECURICRATS 
BUT THE PURPOSE OF TAKING IT OFF YOU WAS TO PUT A BUG IN IT 
AND EVER SINCE I'VE LISTENED TO EVERY SINGLE CONVERSATION THAT YOU'VE HAD EVERY MINUTE OF THE DAY 
AND IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU'LL BELIEVE ANYTHING 
AND THAT'S WHY WE MANAGED TO HAVE PEACE AFTER ALL 
YES THIS ONE'S VERY FAMILIAR 
IT'S ACTUALLY VERY HOMELY 
NOT HAVING A TABLE MADE IT GOOD FOR MEETINGS BECAUSE YOU ALL SIT IN THE CHAIRS 
IT'S QUITE HARD TO TAKE YOURSELF TOO SERIOUSLY IF YOU'RE SITTING IN 
ARMCHAIRS AS OPPOSED TO SITTING ACROSS THE NEGOTIATING TABLE 
WHAT I FELT WAS YOU COULD HAVE REALLY FRANK DISCUSSIONS HERE AND I 
FELT THAT ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS FELT THEY COULD SAY THINGS HERE THEY WOULDN'T FEEL SO COMFORTABLE SAYING 
IN DOWNING STREET OR IN CASTLE BUILDINGS OR SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT 
AND WE COULD GET A MUCH MORE FRUITFUL NEGOTIATION GOING 
CERTAINLY MOST OF THE PROGRESS WE MADE WAS ACTUALLY IN THIS ROOM 
ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THIS MEETING ROOM 
WAS THAT IT WAS RIGHT BESIDE THE CHAPEL 
OH RIGHT 
AND GERRY ADAMS WOULD GO AND SAY A PRAYER EVERY NOW AND AGAIN IF THINGS WERE GETTING VERY DIFFICULT 
THE COSY CHATS AT THE MONASTERY OPENED UP THE POSSIBILITY OF A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH 
ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS SEEMED WILLING TO MOVE IF POWER COULD BE RESTORED TO STORMONT 
POWELL CHOREOGRAPHED A COMPLEX SET OF POLITICAL MOVES BY DAVID TRIMBLE'S UNIONISTS AND SINN FEIN 
THAT WOULD BEGIN WITH FURTHER DECOMMISSIONING 
POWELL'S HOPES HINGED ON ONE MAN 
THE JOB OF THE INTERNATIONAL ARMS MONITOR 
CANADIAN GENERAL JOHN DE CHASTELAIN WAS TO VERIFY THAT DECISIVE DECOMMISSIONING HAD TAKEN PLACE 
WE RECOGNISED THAT THIS WAS A DIFFICULT TASK 
FOR THE PEOPLE WE WERE DEALING WITH 
THEY HAD TO OVERCOME 
CONCERN WITHIN THEIR RANK AND FILE 
IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND THREE DE CHASTELAIN TRAVELLED TO THE IRISH COUNTRYSIDE TO MEET HIS I. R. A. CONTACT 
THE SAME WEEKEND TONY BLAIR WENT INTO HOSPITAL SO POWELL WAS DIRECTING 
THE SHOW WITHOUT HIS BOSS WHEN THINGS STARTED TO GO BADLY WRONG 
DE CHASTELAIN CALLED ME TO SAY THAT DECOMMISSIONING WAS INDEED GOING AHEAD BUT HE WAS NOT GONNA BE 
ALLOWED TO SAY WHAT HE'D SEEN IN TERMS OF DECOMMISSIONING EVEN IN GENERAL TERMS 
HE SAID HE COULD SEE CLEARLY THIS WOULD BE A PROBLEM 
I CALLED TONY JUST AS HE CAME ROUND THAT EVENING IN HAMMERSMITH HOSPITAL AND HE SAID THAT'S RIDICULOUS 
YOU MUST LET THE DECOMMISSIONING GO AHEAD 
TELL DE CHASTELAIN THE DECOMMISSIONING GOES AHEAD 
BUT HE'LL HAVE TO TELL THE I. R. A. HE'LL SAY MORE WHEN HE HAS HIS PRESS CONFERENCE AFTERWARDS 
BUT WHEN POWELL TRIED TO RELAY THIS MESSAGE TO DE CHASTELAIN THE GENERAL WAS INCOMMUNICADO 
WE KNEW HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FINISHED DURING THE DAY BUT HE WAS NEVER RELEASED 
DE CHASTELAIN WAS OUT OF CONTACT SOMEWHERE IN IRELAND WITH THE I. R. A. FOR TWO DAYS 
THE RESULT WAS I STAYED UP VERY VERY LATE ON THE MONDAY NIGHT HOPING DESPERATELY TO FIND 
DE CHASTELAIN AND EVENTUALLY GIVING UP AND TRIMBLE VERY VERY NERVOUS GOING INTO THE TUESDAY 
YOU GENUINELY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE DE CHASTELAIN WAS 
NO ONE COULD HAVE TOLD YOU WHERE DE CHASTELAIN WAS 
MOBILE PHONES HAD BEEN SWITCHED OFF AND THEY'D HAVE BEEN 
TRAVELLING AROUND IN UNMARKED VANS SOMEWHERE IN THE REPUBLIC 
DESPITE THE MISSING GENERAL POWELL AND BLAIR FLEW INTO BELFAST HOPING THE CHOREOGRAPHY WOULD STILL WORK 
WE WERE FLYING OVER TONY AND I IN AN R. A. F. PLANE AND WE WERE COMING IN TO LAND 
AND FINALLY THE PHONE IN THE FRONT OF THE PLANE WENT 
SO THE MINUTE WE WERE ABLE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU 
AND WE DIDN'T STOP TO GO AND HAVE A SHOWER OR A NAP OR ANYTHING WE 
GOT ON THE PHONE AND LET YOU KNOW THAT THE EVENT HAD TAKEN PLACE AND WE WERE 
BACK OUT IN THE WORLD AGAIN 
I TOLD HIM TO GET TO A HELICOPTER AND TO GET UP AS FAST AS HE COULD INTO HILLSBOROUGH 
BECAUSE WE'D GONE OVER ALL BASED ON WHAT HE WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO SAY ABOUT DECOMMISSIONING 
OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE WANTED TO KNOW HAD IT HAPPENED AND IF SO WHAT WAS THE NEXT STEP 
AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL 
TO US THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO SAY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 
ABOUT THE ACT OF DECOMMISSIONING TO MAKE THE COMPLICATED CHOREOGRAPHY WE'D WORKED OUT PROCEED 
YOU KNOW THE KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCE YOU'RE IN 
YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
AND YOU CAN'T BE NECESSARILY AS OPEN AS YOU'D LIKE TO BE ABOUT IT 
HE WAS VERY CLEAR THAT HE COULD NOT SAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN HAD BEEN AGREED WITH 
THE I. R. A. IN ADVANCE 
HIS WORD TO THE I. R. A. WAS ESSENTIAL TO HIM AND HE COULDN'T GAINSAY THAT 
OUR ATTEMPTS TO SCRIPT HIM COMPLETELY FAILED 
WITHIN HOURS OF ARRIVING IN BELFAST DE CHASTELAIN 
BEGAN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE 
IT WAS A FAIRLY TENSE PERIOD SO MY PRESENTATION 
WASN'T EXACTLY BRILLIANT 
IT IS A SHORT REPORT AND IF YOU'RE TAKING NOTES YOU WON'T HAVE TO WRITE FOR VERY LONG 
WE'VE HEARD DAVID TRIMBLE SAY HE WANTS COMPLETE DECOMMISSIONING 
HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO THAT 
ER I CAN'T 
GIVE YOU THE ANSWER YOU WANT 
BECAUSE IF I START SAYING THAT WE'RE A QUARTER OF THE WAY THERE 
I'M GOING BEYOND WHAT I'VE BEEN GIVEN A REMIT TO SAY 
DID YOU SEE HEAVY GEAR GOING DOWN BEING DESTROYED THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW 
WE HAVE SAID THAT WE HAVE DEALT WITH LIGHT MEDIUM AND HEAVY ORDNANCE 
WELL PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT SIR HEAVY ORDNANCE 
AND I'M A SOLDIER INCLUDES SELF PROPELLED ARTILLERY AND TANKS 
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE 
THEY WANT TO KNOW IS IT DEAD IS IT GONE I THINK WE SAID THAT IN OUR FIRST PARAGRAPH 
IT WAS AN UNHAPPY TIME 
MY SPEECH WHEN I MADE THE REPORT WASN'T A PARTICULARLY GOOD ONE 
I'M NOT NECESSARILY A GOOD SPEAKER ANYWAY BUT THAT OBVIOUSLY ER 
WAS NOT MY FINEST MOMENT AS MANY PEOPLE POINTED OUT 
DE CHASTELAIN 
PRESS CONFERENCE POOR GUY BECAUSE HE ACTUALLY DID AN 
EXCELLENT JOB AND SACRIFICED HIMSELF A GREAT DEAL FOR THE PROCESS 
BUT I MEAN THAT WAS BANGING YOUR HEAD AGAINST THE WALL TIME WHEN I SAW THAT PRESS CONFERENCE 
A DEPRESSING DAY OVER THE DE CHASTELAIN PRESS CONFERENCE 
TONY WAS FURIOUS AND BLAMED ME FOR NOT PREPARING IT PROPERLY 
THE WHOLE WAY BACK FROM BELFAST BACK HERE TO LONDON AND TO DOWNING STREET 
TONY WAS LECTURING ME ABOUT HOW USELESS I'D BEEN WHY I'D LET WHOLE THING COLLAPSE 
WHY ON EARTH WE'D GONE THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WHY HAD I NOT PREPARED IT PROPERLY 
WHICH WAS SOMEWHAT DISPIRITING AFTER HAVING HAD A RATHER SPECTACULAR FAILURE IN THE FIRST PLACE 
TONY THOUGHT IT WAS MORE YOUR FAULT THAN DE CHASTELAIN'S DID HE 
OH YES IT WAS DEFINITELY MY FAULT ALSO IT WAS EASIER BECAUSE I WAS ON THE PLANE 
DE CHASTELAIN WAS MILES AWAY 
I WAS SOMEWHERE CONVENIENT TO BE BLAMED 
AND INDEED THAT WAS PART OF MY ROLE TO BE THE BUTT OF THE ANGER TO BE THE PERSON WHO ABSORBED THE PAIN 
IT'S THE JOB OF ANY ACOLYTE LIKE ME 
FIVE YEARS OF UNDERCOVER DIPLOMACY HAD FAILED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF I. R. A. WEAPONS 
AND IN THE ELECTIONS THAT FOLLOWED IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND THREE 
NORTHERN IRELAND'S VOTERS TURNED AWAY FROM THE MODERATE PARTIES WHO SEEMED MOST LIKELY TO BRING PEACE 
THOSE PARTIES BLAMED BLAIR AND POWELL'S DEALINGS WITH SINN FEIN FOR THEIR DEFEAT 
THERE WAS THAT SENSE OF FRUSTRATION AT HAVING GONE OUT ON ALL THE LIMBS 
HAVING TAKEN ALL THE RISKS THAT 
THE S. D. L. P. WERE BEING DISPENSED WITH 
SO THAT 
THE WISHES 
OF A PARAMILITARY GROUP 
WOULD BE RECOGNISED BY SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENTS 
AND IT'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT RESULT FOR SINN FEIN MAKING CONSIDERABLE GAINS 
UNIONIST VOTERS TURNED AWAY FROM DAVID TRIMBLE AND TOWARDS DOCTOR IAN PAISLEY 
PAISLEY WAS KNOWN AS DOCTOR NO BECAUSE OF HIS COMPLETE REJECTION OF ANY TALKS OF ANY SORT WITH SINN FEIN 
WE HAVE OUR FLAGS HERE TONIGHT 
AND WE'VE GIVEN NOTICE TO THE SINN FEINERS AND THE REST OF THEM THAT ULSTER IS NOT FOR SALE 
POWELL HAD NO SPECIAL BOND OF TRUST WITH PAISLEY 
IT LOOKED LIKE HIS PROJECT HAD STALLED FOR GOOD 
BUT POWELL'S BOSS DID FIND A WAY TO GET ALONG WITH DOCTOR NO 
I REMEMBER IAN PAISLEY ALWAYS BEING VERY CLEAR WITH ME WHEN HE WAS RINGING UP TO ARRANGE A MEETING 
OR WHEN HE CAME INTO THE BUILDING THAT HE WOULD HAVE IT BY HIMSELF WITH NO CIVIL SERVANTS PRESENT 
AND AS THE RELATIONSHIP WENT ON SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS SEEMED TO ME TO BE CERTAINLY VERY FRIENDLY 
I WOULD SIT OUTSIDE THE ROOM AT MY DESK AND HEAR LAUGHTER AND A VERY JOLLY CONVERSATION GOING ON INSIDE 
AND THEN I WOULD GO INTO THE ROOM AND DISCOVER RELIGIOUS TRACTS LEFT ON THE DESK 
EVEN ON ONE OCCASION I REMEMBER A LITTLE RELIGIOUS TRACT FOR CHILDREN 
THAT HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN LEFT BEHIND FOR LEO BLAIR 
AND I'D FIND THEM TALKING ON THE PHONE ABOUT GRACE AND SUCH OTHER CONCEPTS 
THAT I HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN GETTING MY MIND AROUND 
HE DID OFTEN TALK TO ME ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF SORT OF REDEMPTION 
YOU KNOW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT 
YOU KNOW WAS VERY MUCH PART OF HIS OWN RELIGIOUS FAITH WHICH IS 
THAT IF SOMEBODY CHANGED THEN YOU SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THE CHANGE AND THAT IT WOULD BE WRONG NOT TO DO SO 
PAISLEY SEEMED TO BELIEVE HIS FORMER ENEMIES COULD BE REDEEMED 
SOON HE WAS WILLING TO CONTEMPLATE SHARING POWER WITH SINN FEIN 
IF THE I. R. A. COULD FINALLY BRING A DEFINITIVE END TO THEIR PARAMILITARY CAMPAIGN 
IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND FOUR BLAIR SENT POWELL BACK TO BELFAST FOR ANOTHER SECRET MEETING 
BUT POWELL'S RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST WITH ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS WAS ABOUT TO RECEIVE A HEAVY BLOW 
ONE OF POWELL'S COLLEAGUES DELIVERED SOME SHOCKING NEWS 
JONATHAN PHILLIPS PICKED ME UP AT THE AIRPORT IN THE OFFICIAL CAR 
WE WERE GOING TO GO AND DRIVE TO A MEETING WITH ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS AT THE CLONARD MONASTERY 
AS WE WERE MAKING OUR PROGRESS ALONG JONATHAN ASKED THE CAR TO STOP 
WHAT POWELL'S COLLEAGUE HAD TO SAY WAS SO SENSITIVE IT COULDN'T BE UTTERED IN FRONT OF THEIR DRIVER 
WE GOT OUT SOMEWHERE ROUND HERE AND WE WALKED ALONG 
AND HE TOLD ME THERE'D BEEN THE BIGGEST ROBBERY IN THE HISTORY OF 
THE UNITED KINGDOM UP TO THAT POINT THE NIGHT BEFORE 
SOME THIRTY MILLION HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM THE NORTHERN BANK 
POWELL WAS TOLD WHO WAS BEHIND THE ROBBERY 
THE DOGS ON THE STREET KNEW THAT IT WAS THE I. R. A. THAT HAD DONE IT 
I FELT VERY PERSONALLY LET DOWN TO HAVE FLOWN ALL THE WAY OVER HERE TO BE KEEPING THE PROCESS GOING 
I FELT ABSOLUTELY FURIOUS I FELT LIKE KICKING SOMETHING 
POWELL HAD TO MAKE A ROADSIDE DECISION TO KEEP TALKING OR GIVE UP IN DISGUST 
IT'S VERY HARD BECAUSE YOU ARE A HUMAN BEING AND SO YOUR 
HUMAN SENTIMENTS TAKE OVER BUT YOU HAVE TO TRY AND 
PUT THOSE BACK IN A BOX AND THINK ABOUT THE STRATEGIC AIM YOU HAVE WHICH IS TO TRY AND GET TO PEACE 
POWELL CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY TO CLONARD MONASTERY 
THE TALKING HAD TO GO ON 
BUT HE KNEW HE WOULD BE UNABLE TO BRING UP THE SUBJECT OF THE ROBBERY 
SINCE THE NEWS WAS STILL BEING KEPT UNDER WRAPS 
I TURNED UP FEELING LIKE A COMPLETE SORT OF CHUMP 
LIKE I'D BEEN TAKEN FOR A RIDE ON THE ISSUE 
YOU WERE IN A FOUL MOOD 
DURING THE MEETING YOU WERE JUST TOTALLY UNCOMFORTABLE IN YOUR SKIN 
AND WE LEFT AND THEN THE NEWS BROKE AND WE KNEW WHY 
AND WE KNEW THAT THINGS WERE IN DEEP DEEP TROUBLE 
IT'S BUILT LIKE A FORTRESS ONE OF BELFAST'S BIGGEST BANKS BUT TODAY THE MONEY WAS ALL GONE 
INEVITABLY THE SPECULATION THAT PARAMILITARIES MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED 
POWELL HAD ALWAYS SUSTAINED HIS FAITH IN THE GOOD INTENTIONS OF 
ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS BUT HIS DIARY REVEALS THAT NOW HIS FAITH WAVERED 
I FOUND IT RATHER SAD GIVEN HOW MUCH TIME AND EFFORT I'D PUT INTO TRYING TO GET A SOLUTION 
IT LOOKS TO ME AS THOUGH THE REASON THAT THE REPUBLICANS DON'T CARE 
THAT THE PRICE GOES UP EACH TIME WE NEGOTIATE BECAUSE THEY NEVER INTEND TO DELIVER 
THE WHOLE THING IS JUST A LONG NEGOTIATION FOR THEM TO STRING THINGS OUT 
WELL THEY OFTEN LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE JUST NEGOTIATING AND THEY WERE ADDICTED TO NEGOTIATING REALLY 
BLAIR'S FAITH THAT POWELL'S UNDERCOVER DIPLOMACY COULD DELIVER THE GOODS ALSO WAVERED 
CURIOUSLY ENOUGH I THINK I WAS 
AT MY MOST PESSIMISTIC 
ABOUT TWO YEARS BEFORE I LEFT OFFICE 
ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FIVE WAS MY MOST PESSIMISTIC BECAUSE I COULDN'T SEE HOW WE COULD BUILD THE MODERATE MAJORITY THERE 
I COULDN'T SEE EITHER HOW 
YOU KNOW THE I. R. A. GOT THEMSELVES INTO A DIFFERENT POSITION 
THE MAN WHO DIED WAS FOUND LYING NEARBY WITH A STAB WOUND TO HIS STOMACH 
SOON AFTER THE NORTHERN BANK ROBBERY 
ROBERT MCCARTNEY WAS MURDERED BY I. R. A. THUGS 
REPUBLICANS WERE NOW UNDER SEVERE PRESSURE 
BLAIR TOLD JONATHAN POWELL TO KEEP TALKING TO ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS 
AND PRESS THEM TO FACE DOWN HARDLINERS IN THEIR OWN MOVEMENT 
IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND FIVE POWELL'S PHONE RANG AGAIN 
GERRY ADAMS ASKED TO SEE HIM AT A HOTEL AT DUBLIN AIRPORT 
ONCE AGAIN ONLY BLAIR AND POWELL'S P. A. KNEW ABOUT HIS JOURNEY 
WHEN I CAME HERE IN MARCH IT DID LOOK VERY BLEAK 
I THINK WE WERE WORRIED AT THE TIME THERE WERE HINTS AND RUMOURS 
THAT MADE US THINK THERE WAS EVERY PROSPECT THAT VIOLENCE COULD START AGAIN 
SO WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT IT 
MCGUINNESS AND ADAMS MUST HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE NERVOUS BEING PERSONALLY AT RISK IF IT HAD HAPPENED 
THEY COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED AT ANY MOMENT IF THEY'D TAKEN A MIS STEP 
SO WHEN I ARRIVED AT RECEPTION I WAS MET BY A GUY WITH A SHAVEN HEAD LOOKING VERY OMINOUS 
HE TOOK ME TO THE LIFT AND BROUGHT ME UPSTAIRS TO THESE ROOMS 
THERE WERE ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS AT THE TABLE 
SHEETS OF PAPER IN FRONT OF THEM 
THEY TOLD ME TO SIT DOWN THE GUY LEFT AND THE THREE OF US WERE LEFT THERE ALONE IN THE HOTEL ROOM 
I CAME WITH SOME IDEAS I HAD A NOTE FROM TONY 
WHICH SET UP AN APPROACH BASED ON SMALL STEPS AS OPPOSED TO GOING FOR A SOLUTION IN ONE BIG BANG 
A SECTION OF THE SPEECH THAT I HAD WRITTEN ON THE FUTURE OF THE I. R. A. 
FOR ADAMS OR MCGUINNESS AND SOME IDEAS OF MY OWN 
BUT AFTER I LISTENED TO THEM ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS SET OUT WHAT THEY HAD ALREADY PLANNED TO DO 
WHAT THEY TOLD ME WAS THAT THEY HAD DECIDED THAT THE I. R. A. WAS NEVER GOING 
TO GIVE UP IN RESPONSE TO UNIONIST PRESSURE 
IT WAS NEVER GOING TO GIVE UP IN RESPONSE TO PRESSURE FROM THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT 
AND THE ONLY PERSON IT WOULD GIVE UP IN RESPONSE TO WAS GERRY ADAMS 
WELL OBVIOUSLY THINGS WERE VERY DIFFICULT AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME 
NO POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER MOVEMENT WHATSOEVER 
AND OBVIOUSLY A JUDGEMENT HAD TO BE MADE ABOUT 
WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO DO THAT 
AND I THINK THAT AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION AND DELIBERATION 
MYSELF AND GERRY WITH OTHER LEADERS WITHIN SINN FEIN CAME TO A VIEW THAT 
SOMETHING DECISIVE HAD TO HAPPEN 
POWELL HAD LIVED THROUGH SO MANY FAILED OPPORTUNITIES 
NOW ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS HAD TOLD POWELL THEY WERE CAREFULLY 
CONSIDERING CALLING FOR AN END TO THE I. R. A.'S PARAMILITARY CAMPAIGN 
HE WAITED TO SEE IF THIS OPPORTUNITY WOULD GO THE SAME WAY AS THE OTHERS 
OF RAIDING SINN FEIN'S OFFICES AT STORMONT 
IT IS A SHORT REPORT AND IF YOU'RE TAKING NOTES YOU WON'T 
SO MUCH CASH INEVITABLY THE SPECULATION THAT PARAMILITARIES MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED 
A MONTH AFTER HIS FIRST VISIT ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS SUMMONED POWELL BACK TO THE SAME HOTEL 
NOW THEY HAD MADE THEIR DECISION 
GERRY ADAMS HIMSELF WAS WAITING FOR ME IN THE LOBBY AND HE TOOK ME TO A ROOM 
AND SAT ME DOWN AND GAVE ME A PIECE OF PAPER ON WHICH WAS SET OUT THE WORDS OF HIS APPEAL TO THE I. R. A. 
ADAMS SAID HE HADN'T SHOWN THE STATEMENT TO ANYONE APART FROM MCGUINNESS AND I GUESS THEY 
TRUSTED ME ENOUGH TO SOUND ME OUT 
BEFORE THEN PUTTING IT TO THEIR OWN INNER CIRCLES TO SEE IF IT WOULD WORK 
IN THE PAST I HAVE DEFENDED THE RIGHT OF THE I. R. A. TO ENGAGE IN ARMED STRUGGLE 
I DID SO BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE FOR THOSE 
WHO WOULD NOT BEND THE KNEE OR TURN A BLIND EYE TO OPPRESSION 
NOW THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE 
NOW THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE 
THAT ALTERNATIVE IS SINN FEIN 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT MEANS THE I. R. A.'S GOING OUT OF BUSINESS 
THE COLD STARKNESS OF IT REALLY QUITE SHOCKED ME WHEN I READ IT 
AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF ARGUING ABOUT AMBIGUOUS WORDING FINALLY 
HERE WAS THE END IN CLEAR WORDS THAT EVERYONE COULD UNDERSTAND 
THE I. R. A. RESPONDED TO GERRY ADAMS' PLEA 
AND FINALLY GAVE UP ALL THEIR WEAPONS 
AFTER NEARLY A DECADE OF UNDERCOVER DIPLOMACY POWELL'S NEGOTIATIONS HAD FINALLY PAID OFF 
TUESDAY FIFTH JULY TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS CAME TO SEE US 
IT'S FUNNY THEY DO SEEM MORE LIKE POLITICIANS NOW THAN CAPOS 
I THINK I FELT A SENSE OF PRIDE THAT 
NOT PRIDE IN MYSELF I THINK BUT PROUD OF WHAT THEY HAD ACHIEVED 
IT WAS A BIT LIKE WATCHING YOUR CHILDREN GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE 
YOU THOUGHT FANTASTIC NOW THEY'RE FREE 
NOW THEY'VE DONE IT AND THEY'RE ON THEY'RE OWN 
I WANT TO WISH YOU ALL THE BEST AS WE STEP FORWARD TOWARDS THE GREATEST 
YET MOST EXCITING CHALLENGE OF OUR LIVES 
SINN FEIN ARE NOW SHARING POWER WITH UNIONISTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
FOR JONATHAN POWELL THE TORTUOUS DECADE OF NEGOTIATIONS HAS A CLEAR LESSON 
I THINK THE CONCLUSION I'VE COME TO GOING BACK THROUGH GOVERNMENT FILES AND GOING 
BACK THROUGH MY DIARIES IS THAT YOU SHOULD TALK TO YOUR ENEMIES 
I WOULDN'T ALWAYS HAVE THOUGHT THIS BUT I DO NOW THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE 
CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER TERRORIST MOVEMENTS TOO 
YOU SHOULD HAVE THEM WITH HAMAS WITH THE TALIBAN WITH AL QAEDA 
IT'S MUCH HARDER TO KILL PEOPLE WHEN YOU KNOW THEM 
YOU HAVE TO GET TO KNOW PEOPLE AND BUILD A RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST TO BREAK OUT OF THIS CYCLE OF VIOLENCE 
IF WE THOUGHT OF THE TALIBAN OR HAMAS OR AL QAEDA AS HUMAN BEINGS RATHER THAN 
AS TERRORISTS IF THEY THOUGHT OF US AS HUMAN BEINGS RATHER THAN 
WESTERN GOVERNMENTS IMPOSING THEIR WILL 
THEN IT WOULD BE MUCH HARDER TO CARRY ON FIGHTING RATHER THAN REACH A PEACEFUL SOLUTION
