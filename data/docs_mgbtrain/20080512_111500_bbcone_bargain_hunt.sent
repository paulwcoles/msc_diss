FRIENDS ROMANS BARGAIN HUNTERS THIS IS THE RIVER DEE IN CHESTER 
ONE OF ENGLAND'S MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND MAGNIFICENT ROMAN CITIES 
WE'RE HERE TO DIG UP SOME LUCRATIVE ANTIQUES AT THE FAIR SO LET'S GO BARGAIN HUNTING 
WHAT COMES TO MIND WHEN YOU THINK OF CHESTER 
WELL APART FROM THE RIVER AND THE ROMAN REMAINS 
I LIKE TO THINK OF THE WORLD FAMOUS CHESTER ZOO 
SO TODAY ON THE TRAIL OF BARGAINS WE'VE GOT TWO TEAMS OF ANIMAL LOVERS FROM THE ZOO 
WE GIVE EACH TEAM THREE HUNDRED TO TRACK DOWN THREE ITEMS WHICH WILL BE SOLD AT AUCTION 
THE IDEA IS TO CAPTURE A PROFIT AND GIVE IT A GOOD HOME THEIR POCKETS 
WELCOME TO THE TEAMS FROM CHESTER ZOO 
WE HAVE LAURA AND ANDREW WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE KEEPING THE ANIMALS HAPPY 
AND FIONA AND LIZ WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO KEEP THE VISITORS AWAY I MEAN HAPPY 
AND A LITTLE BIRDIE TOLD ME THAT THERE'S A BIT OF ANIMAL MAGIC BETWEEN YOU TWO IS THAT RIGHT 
YEAH WE'LL HAVE NO MONKEY BUSINESS TODAY 
WHERE DID YOU MEET THEN IN THE CARNIVORE HOUSE 
WE MET ON THE CARNIVORE SECTION STILL GOT THE TEETH MARKS TO PROVE IT HE HAS 
HE HAS A VERY GOOD ANSWER 
SO LAURA HOW DID YOU GET INTO THIS KEEPING LARK 
WELL I ALWAYS WANTED TO WORK WITH ANIMALS 
I CAME TO THE ZOO ON WORK EXPERIENCE 
I GOT A JOB IN THE END AND STAYED OH THAT'S NICE ISN'T IT 
I KNOW YOU'RE INTERESTED IN PRESERVING ANTIQUES WHAT DO YOU COLLECT 
I LIKE ANYTHING FROM THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES MY PRIZE POSSESSION'S MY COCKTAIL BAR 
IS IT FAB IT IS AMAZING 
IS IT REALLY FAB HAS IT GOT FORMICA ON IT YEAH 
SMOKED GLASS YES A BIT OF CHROME 
IT'S GOT ALL THAT IS IT WELL STOCKED 
IT WAS THEY'RE GOOD FUN THOSE THINGS AREN'T THEY 
WELL WE SEE QUITE A FEW ANTIQUES ON BARGAIN HUNT MADE OF ANIMAL PARTS 
USUALLY OLD ANIMAL PARTS HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT BOTH OF YOU 
WE'RE BOTH PRETTY MUCH AGAINST IT 
WHAT'S HIDING BEHIND YOUR BACKS 
THESE ARE TWO EXAMPLES THAT WERE CONFISCATED BY CUSTOMS 
THEY'RE BOTH ILLEGAL 
THIS ONE WE'VE GOT A HAWKSBILL TURTLE THESE ARE STILL QUITE HEAVILY POACHED AT THE MOMENT 
THEIR NUMBERS ARE DWINDLING 
AND THERE ARE CONSERVATION PROJECTS SET UP 
SUCH AS IN SRI LANKA AND IN CENTRAL AMERICA THAT THE ZOO DO HELP ALONG WITH 
THIS ONE HERE IS WHAT WAS A CAYMAN 
IT'S BEEN MADE INTO A HANDBAG 
AGAIN ANOTHER SPECIES THAT'S ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION 
WE USE THESE AT THE ZOO FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES 
TO SHOW PEOPLE THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE THESE ANY MORE 
AND QUITE RIGHT TOO BUT I CAN GUARANTEE YOU WE'LL HAVE NO ANIMAL PARTS ON BARGAIN HUNT TODAY 
FIONA AND LIZ FROM THE VISITOR SERVICES' DEPARTMENT 
ARE THE VISITORS MORE TROUBLE THAN THE ANIMALS 
NO NOT ALWAYS WE DO GET QUITE A FEW UNUSUAL REQUESTS LIKE WHAT 
WELL WE HAD A GENTLEMAN WRITE IN WHO WANTED TO LIVE IN A LION ENCLOSURE IN A MUD HUT FOR A MONTH 
WHICH YOU NATURALLY ALLOWED HIM TO DO BECAUSE IT CUT DOWN ON THE FUEL BILL 
AND A VERY VERY SWEET LETTER FROM A LITTLE GIRL QUITE LOCAL WHO WANTED TO BORROW AN ANTEATER 
TO GET RID OF THE ANT PROBLEM IN HER AUNTIE'S KITCHEN HOW SWEET 
WHAT BETTER SOLUTION EXACTLY 
YOU MAY NOT ALWAYS LOVE THE VISITORS BUT YOU ALWAYS LOVE THE ANIMALS DON'T YOU YES 
YEAH YEAH IN FACT I'VE GOT A BIT OF A ZOO AT HOME YES WHO HAVE YOU GOT AT HOME 
WELL I HAVE THREE DOGS THREE CATS A HORSE A GOAT AND A PIG CALLED TREVOR 
SOUNDS LIKE A NOISY OLD PLACE YEAH IT'S NOISIER BECAUSE I'M A FAN OF KARAOKE 
I USED TO SING PROFESSIONALLY DID YOU YES 
SO ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE US A BIT OF A BELT THEN 
YEAH I WILL IF I CAN HAVE SOME ASSISTANCE FROM THE BOSS LADY 
O. K. GO FOR IT GIRLS

MY ONLY SUNSHINE 
YOU MAKE ME HAPPY WHEN SKIES ARE GREY 
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO LAUGH DOES SHE SING AT WORK THEN LIZ 
ONLY TO KNOW SOMEONE ELSE SINGS WORSE THAN ME I LET HER SING AT TIMES 
OH DON'T BE LIKE THAT 
SO YOU LOOK AFTER THE VISITORS AT THE ZOO YES I DO YES 
IS THAT A GOOD JOB IT'S FANTASTIC YES 
ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T GET CLOSE TO THE ANIMALS AT WORK 
YOU HAVE HAD A CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF A TOOTHED KIND 
I HAVE YES YES I ONCE DIVED IN OUR LOCAL AQUARIUM WITH SOME SHARKS 
I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY MORE SCARY FOR THE SHARKS COMING FACE TO FACE WITH ME 
THAN IT WAS ME COMING FACE TO FACE WITH THEM IS THAT THE SCARIEST THING YOU'VE EVER DONE NO 
ONCE I DID A SKYDIVE 
A TEN THOUSAND FOOT SKYDIVE THAT WAS QUITE SCARY 
IT WAS SO SCARY THAT I WAS GRITTING MY TEETH ALL THE WAY DOWN 
AND CHIPPED ONE OF MY TEETH IN HALF 
DID YOU WHICH ONE WAS IT YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE IT'S NOT VERY PLEASANT 
NOW WE COME TO THE MONEY MOMENT 
THREE HUNDRED EACH YOU KNOW THE RULES 
OFF YOU GO TWO BY TWO 
TRYING TO TAME OUR TEAMS TODAY 
FOR THE REDS IT'S THE WILD AND DANGEROUS PHILIP SERRELL 
AND FOR THE BLUES A VERY RARE SPECIES INDEED

THIS COMPANY HERE WHO MADE OUR DEAR OLD MATE PINKY 
CAN I HAVE A GO WITH IT WELL AT YOUR AGE YOU SHOULD BE KNOCKING THEM ON THE HEAD

CHARLES WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND A HATPIN 
WHERE DID YOU FIND THAT IT WAS JUST DOWN HERE 
I'VE GOT A SNEAKING SUSPICION IT HAS A CHESTER HALLMARK 
AH I THOUGHT YOU KNEW NOTHING ABOUT ANTIQUES 
HOW DID YOU KNOW IT'S CHESTER 
WE'VE HAD A LITTLE ASSISTANCE FROM THE STALLHOLDER 
WELL WHAT'S ITS USE IT'S A HATPIN WE THINK CORRECT YOU ARE RIGHT 
WE WEAR A LOT OF HATS DO YOU WEAR HATS 
NORMALLY I'D WEAR ONE ZOO HATS 
NO WE DON'T REALLY IT IS VERY NICE 
WHAT WE LOOK FOR FIRST OF ALL IS STYLE THE MARKETS DEALING IN SILVER LIKE STYLE THAT'S GOT STYLE 
IT'S LOVELY IT'S REALLY PRETTY YEAH 
TYPICALLY ART NOUVEAU AND IT'S A NICE FORM 
LET'S CHECK THE HALLMARK OH GOOD IT'S NICELY HALLMARKED AS WELL 
WHAT WE'VE GOT ARE MARKS FOR CHARLES HORNER WHO WAS A LEADING EXPONENT 
OF ARTS AND CRAFTS OF THE ART NOUVEAU MOVEMENT IN FORM AND STYLE 
WHAT'S THE STONE FIONA I'M NOT CERTAIN ACTUALLY 
IS IT AMBER IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A DIAMOND NO 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE THEN CHARLES HORNER 
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT 
A VERY GOOD GUESS TELL YOU WHAT I'M GOING TO GO AND LIE DOWN NOW 
HOW RUDE 
SHOCKING SHOCKING 
WHAT WE'VE GOT IT SHOULD BE AMBER 
QUITE CLEARLY IT'S A SYNTHETIC STONE BUT IT'S NICE 
WHAT'S ON IT 
THEY'RE ASKING EIGHTY FIVE FOR IT BUT WE THINK WE CAN GET THEM DOWN A BIT 
WIND BEHIND IT 
KEEPING YOUR HAT ON IT'S WORTH BETWEEN FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED 
SEVENTY TO ONE HUNDRED THEREABOUTS 
O. K. LET'S DO OUR BEST THEN YEP LET'S GO FOR IT 
AFTER A TAD BARTERING THE BLUES MANAGED TO PIN DOWN THEIR FIRST ITEM FOR EIGHTY 
HERE'S A PRETTY LITTLE COLLECTIBLE DO YOU LIKE THAT 
THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE PASSION FOR PORTRAITS OF CHILDREN 
HARDLY SURPRISING BECAUSE A LOT OF US HAVE GOT CHILDREN 
THIS IS A NICE LOOKING LITTLE CHILD 
HE'S GOT FATTISH CHEEKS LOOK 
CRISP HAIR ALL WRAPPED AROUND HIS CONTINENTAL CLOCHE LOOKING HAT 
WITH A NECKERCHIEF TIED ROUND HIS NECK AND THE WHOLE THING SITS ON A CIRCULAR BASED CALLED A SOCLE 
MOST OF THESE BUSTS ARE IN BRONZE OR PLASTER SOMETIMES IN PARIAN 
WHICH IS A CERAMIC THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE MARBLE 
THIS ONE IS SOLID CARRARA MARBLE 
YOU HAVE TO THINK THAT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO SOME CLEVER ITALIAN 
HAD A ROUGH HEWN BLOCK OF SOLID STONE AND HE STARTED TO CHIP AWAY AT IT 
HE USED BIG CHISELS TO MAKE THE ROUGH OUTLINE 
AND GRADUALLY HE REDUCED THE CHISELS UNTIL HE HAD A PERFECTLY FORMED POLISHED VERSION 
WHICH IS WHAT WE SEE TODAY 
SO THERE ARE HOURS AND HOURS OF WORK IN MAKING THIS THING 
UNFORTUNATELY HE DIDN'T SIGN IT 
AS AN ANONYMOUS BUST I GUESS SOMEONE WOULD PAY BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED AT AUCTION 
WHAT DID I FIND IT PRICED UP AT AT HIS STALL AROUND THE CORNER TEN 
IT'S A STEAL 
PHIL WE'VE BROUGHT YOU A PICNIC 
YOU'VE BROUGHT ME A PICNIC 
YEP WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS

IT'S VERY VERA DUCKWORTH THE FIRST THING WE CHECK IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY A FLASK ALWAYS SHAKE IT 
IF YOU HEAR BITS ON GRAIN GOING AROUND THERE 
THEN THAT MEANS THE ACTUAL FLASK ITSELF IS BROKEN IT'S ONLY GLASS 
BETTER TO LEAVE WELL ALONE 
THE THING ABOUT RETRO STUFF IS IF YOU'VE LIVED IN IT IT AIN'T QUITE SO FUNNY 
BUT MILK OUT OF THERE 
GO ON OH YES IT'S AWFUL ISN'T IT 
AND YOU'D HAVE YOUR TEA AND IT JUST TASTED A BIT PLASTICKY 
HOW MUCH IS IT IT'S UP FOR TWENTY AT THE MOMENT 
IT'S NICE ON THE CUPS THERE LOOK THEY'VE GOT BREXTON ON THE BOTTOM 
AND WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THESE IS YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT FOUR OF THE ORIGINAL SPOONS

BEFORE THE AUCTION I FEEL LIKE MESSING ABOUT ON THE RIVER 
ALL ABOARD 
THIS IS THE PILCOMAYO BUILT BY THE CHESTER BOAT COMPANY HERE ON THE RIVER DEE IN NINETEEN TEN

ALISTAIR'S GOING TO CAST OFF I'M GOING TO SLUMP SEAN 
RIGHT THAT'S WHAT THIS BOAT WAS BUILT FOR TIM SLUMPING 
YOU DON'T GENERALLY THINK ABOUT BOATS AS BEING ANTIQUES 
BUT THIS THING WAS BUILT AT THE HEIGHT OF THE EDWARDIAN ERA 
AND IT'S MAGNIFICENT THAT IT'S STILL GOING UP AND DOWN THE RIVER SO EFFICIENTLY TODAY 
IT IS MADE OF TEAK MARVELLOUS HARDWOOD 
AND IT'S BEEN BEAUTIFULLY MAINTAINED OVER THE YEARS 
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THESE RIVER CRAFT IS THE DESIGN 
YOU SEE HOW QUICKLY WE'RE MOVING UP THE RIVER 
IT CREATES NO WAKE NO WAVES THAT ARE GOING TO GO OFF AND ERODE THE PRECIOUS RIVER BANKS 
EXTRAORDINARY ISN'T IT

WELL AFTER MANY MANY YEARS OF A LOVELY OLD PETROL ENGINE LAST YEAR WE FINALLY BROKE DOWN SO OFTEN

NINETEEN TWENTY SIX 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE FIRST ENGINE WAS 
WELL SOME OF THE HOLES IN THE WOODWORK SUGGEST THAT THE PIPES WERE MUCH BIGGER 
AND IT MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN STEAM 
SO SEAN IF I OFFERED TO TAKE THIS BOAT OFF YOUR HANDS AND PUT IT IN AN AUCTION WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
