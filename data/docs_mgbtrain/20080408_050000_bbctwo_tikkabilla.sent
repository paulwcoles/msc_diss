IT'S A RED HAT 
A HAT AND A SCARF GO TOGETHER 
THERE WE ARE WE DID IT 
WE FOLLOWED THE WIGGLY LINES 
AND FOUND THE ITEMS THAT GO TOGETHER 
YOU KNOW THESE WIGGLY LINES LOOK A BIT LIKE SNAKES DON'T THEY 
AND THERE ARE SOME SNAKES THROUGH THE WINDOWS TODAY 
SHALL WE HAVE A LOOK 
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN SEE SOME WIGGLY SNAKES 
HOW MANY WINDOWS 
ONE 
TWO 
THREE 
ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED 
WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
IT'S THE ROUND WINDOW 
HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED THE WAY SNAKES MOVE ALONG 
THEY MOVE ALONG IN A BENDY SHAPE A BIT LIKE THE LETTER S. 
SNAKES DON'T HAVE ANY ARMS OR LEGS 
SO THEY HAVE TO USE THEIR WHOLE BODY TO GET FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER 
MOST SNAKES LIVE IN WARM PLACES 
BECAUSE THEY NEED THE SUN TO KEEP THEM WARM 
SNAKES ARE A TYPE OF REPTILE 
THIS SNAKE IS POKING OUT ITS FORKED TONGUE 
JUST LOOK AT ITS TONGUE FLICKING AROUND 
SNAKES USE THEIR TONGUES TO SMELL A BIT LIKE WE USE OUR NOSES 
TO SNIFF OUT SOMETHING TO EAT 
SOME SNAKES ARE POISONOUS 
THIS IS A TYPE OF SNAKE CALLED A COBRA 
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS BECAUSE OF ITS POISON 
COBRAS HAVE A FLAT LOOKING HEAD 
AND THEY CAN STAND UP ON THEIR TAIL IF YOU GET TOO CLOSE TO THEM 
IN THIS COUNTRY THERE IS ONLY ONE SNAKE WHICH CAN HURT YOU 
BUT YOU HARDLY EVER SEE ONE 
IT'S CALLED AN ADDER 
AND IT HAS A ZIGZAG PATTERN ON ITS BACK 
ANOTHER SNAKE WHICH YOU MIGHT SEE IN YOUR GARDEN IS A GRASS SNAKE 
GRASS SNAKES ARE NOT POISONOUS 
THEY LIKE TO EAT SMALL ANIMALS BUT THEY WOULDN'T HURT YOU 
SOME SNAKES LIVE IN THE DESERT 
THIS IS A SIDEWINDER SNAKE 
IT'S CALLED THIS BECAUSE IT MOVES SIDEWAYS 
AND LEAVES A PATTERN IN THE SAND 
IN VERY WARM PLACES 
YOU EVEN GET SNAKES WHICH LIVE IN THE SEA 
SEA SNAKES ARE GREAT SWIMMERS 
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT SNAKES 
MOST OF THEM WON'T HURT YOU AT ALL 
UNLESS YOU GET TOO CLOSE TO THEM 
SO IF YOU EVER SEE A SNAKE 
I'M A SLIPPERY SLIDEY SNAKE 
WATCH ME SLITHER 
I'M A SLIPPERY SLIDEY SNAKE 
I SLITHER HITHER AND THITHER 
I'M A SLIPPERY SLIDEY SNAKE 
I'M A SLIPPERY SLIDEY SNAKE 
WILL YOU JOIN IN AND DO THE ACTIONS WITH ME 
WILL YOU PUT YOUR HAND UP LIKE THAT 
AND THEN WIGGLE YOUR THUMB 
SO IT'S LIKE A SLIPPERY SNAKE'S TONGUE 
READY 
I'M A SLIPPERY SLIDEY SNAKE 
WATCH ME SLITHER 
I'M A SLIPPERY SLIDEY SNAKE 
I SLITHER HITHER AND THITHER 
I'M A SLIPPERY SLIDEY SNAKE

WHEN THE SUN COMES OUT WE ALL HAVE LOTS OF FUN 
OH THE SUN IS PART OF THE WEATHER 
WHEN THE CLOUDS APPEAR THEY COVER UP THE SUN 
WHEN THE CLOUDS APPEAR THEY COVER UP THE SUN 
WHEN THE CLOUDS APPEAR SUNNY DAYS ARE GONE 
OH THE CLOUDS ARE PART OF THE WEATHER 
WHEN THE RAIN FALLS DOWN IT TUMBLES FROM THE CLOUDS 
WHEN THE RAIN FALLS DOWN IT TUMBLES FROM THE CLOUDS 
WHEN THE RAIN FALLS DOWN IT'S TIME TO SHOUT OUT LOUD 
OH THE RAIN IS PART OF THE WEATHER 
WHEN THE THUNDER CRACKS IT ECHOES IN THE RAIN 
WHEN THE THUNDER CRACKS IT ECHOES IN THE RAIN 
WHEN THE THUNDER CRACKS IT RATTLES WINDOWPANES 
OH THE THUNDER IS PART OF THE WEATHER 
OH 
WHEN THE WIND BLOWS STRONG THE THUNDER RUNS AWAY 
WHEN THE WIND BLOWS STRONG THE THUNDER RUNS AWAY 
WHEN THE WIND BLOWS STRONG THIS IS WHAT WE SAY 
OH THE WIND IS PART OF THE WEATHER 
THEN THE SUN COMES OUT AND SHINES ON EVERYONE 
THEN THE SUN COMES OUT AND SHINES ON EVERYONE
