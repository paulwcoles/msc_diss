THIS WEEK ON THE POLITICS SHOW 
JUDE BOB AND MARGARET THEY'RE 
BACK LAST WEEK OUR VIEWERS' PANEL 
LOOKED AT M. P.'S EXPENSES AND NOW THEY 
PRESENT THEIR CONCLUSIONS TO 
HARRIET HARMAN AND WE'LL BE ASKING 
IF OLD PEOPLE ARE DISCRIMINATED 
AGAINST 
I COULD STAND HERE WITH AGAINST NOTHING ON AND NOBODY WOULDING TO 
PAY ATTENTION 
AND WITH THE OLYMPIC 
ASSOCIATION COMING TO LONDON THIS 
WEEK HAS BORIS JOHNSON SIGNALLED A 
CHANGE CHANGE AND WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT 
ALL IMPORTANT BY ELECTION IN CREWE 
AND NANTWICH BUT FIRST THE NEWS 
THE FOREIGN OFFICE MINISTER LORD 
MALLOCH BROWN HAS SAID HE'S MAKING 
PROGRESS IN HIS EFFORTS TO GET MORE 
INTERNATIONAL AID TO THE SURVIVORS 
OF THE CYCLONE IN BURMA DURING 
MEETINGS IN RANGOON HE'S HANDED 
OVER A LETTER FROM GORDON BROWN 
WHICH CALLS FOR POLITICAL 
DIFFERENCES TO BE PUT ASIDE 
THESE ARE THE SORT OF IMAGES THE 
BURMESE MILITARY HAVE BEEN TRYING 
TO HIDE 
THE MISERY STILL ENGULFING THE 
IRRAWADDY DELTA TWO WEEKS AFTER THE 
CYCLONE THESE SURVIVORS ARE 
STARTING TO RECEIVE SOME AID BUT 
PERHAPS A MILLION PEOPLE REMAIN 
WITHOUT TODAY THOUGH A BRITISH 
ENVOY IN RANGOON INSISTED THAT 
DIPLOMACY NOT CONFRONTATION WAS 
THE BEST OPTION AND HE SAID THE 
GENERALS WERE STARTING TO CHANGE 
THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARDS OUTSIDE HELP 
WE'VE MET TODAY WITH THE LINE 
MINISTERS WHO ARE DEALING WITH THE 
DELIVERED TO THEM A LETTER FOR 
THEIR NUMBER ONE LEADER THE SENIOR 
LEADER THAN SHWE FROM GORDON 
BROWN INSISTING THAT THIS WAS A 
HUMANITARIAN ENTERPRISE AND WE PUT 
POLITICS ASIDE TO HELP THE VICTIMS 
OF THE CYCLONE AND I THINK THEY 
ARE RESPONDING IN KIND AND TREATING 
THIS ON THE TERMS WE'RE OFFERING IT 
OFF THE COAST AMERICAN BRITISH 
AND FRENCH NAVY SHIPS ARE POISED TO 
DELIVER VAST QUANTITIES OF AID BUT 
BURMA'S GENERALS ARE STILL SAYING 
NO INSTEAD THE FOCUS NOW IS ON 
GETTING NEIGHBOURING GOVERNMENTS 
WHICH GET ON A LITTLE BETTER WITH 
THE GENERALS TO TAKE THE LEAD AND 
IN THE DELTA THE SUPPLIES KEEP 
TRICKLING THROUGH BUT IT IS MUCH 
TOO LITTLE TOO SLOWLY CHINA SAYS 
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE KORCHED TO 
HAVE DIED IN 
HAMPERED PI HEAVY RAIN AND 
AFTERSHOCK THE CHINESE PRESIDENT 
HAS EXPRESSED THANKS FOR THE 
INTERNATIONAL AID EFFORT IT HAS 
EMERGED THE LEADING CHECKTIVE OF 
B. A. E. SYSTEMS WAS DETAINED WHEN HE 
ARRIVED LAST WEEK ON A BUSINESS 
TRIP MIKE TURNER AND A SENIOR 
CLEGG WERE HELD AT HOUSTON AIRPORT 
THEY WERE LATER RELEASED OF 
PERSONAL DOCUMENT HAVE BEEN 
EXAMINED AMERICAN OFFICIALS ARE 
INVESTIGATING CORRUPTION ALLEGATION 
INVOLVING A HUGE ARMS DEAL 
GORDON BROWN HAS SAID HE'LL BACK 
CONTROVERSIAL RESEARCH USING 
HUMAN SLASH ANIMAL HYBRIDS IN PARLIAMENT 
TOMORROW IN A NEWSPAPER INTERVIEW 
THE PRIME MINISTER SAID HE BELIEVED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS 
RESEARCH AND THEREFORE THE 
POTENTIAL TREATMENTS I THINK 
WOULD BE A TRAVESTY AND WE NEED TO 
MAKE IT CLEAR AT ALL TIMES THAT 
CAN CAN ONLY BE CONDUCTED IF IT IS 
THE ONLY ROUTE THAT IS AVAILABLE 
ALONGSIDE HYBRID EMBRYOS THERE IS 
ALSO CONTROVERSY OVER ENDING THE 
NEED FOR A FATHER FIGURE WHEN 
RECEIVING I. V. F. TREATMENT AND SO 
CALLED SAVIOUR SIBLINGS IN THE 
ABORTION LAWS 
PRESSURE IS MOUNTING FOR A 
REDUCTION IN THE LEGAL TIME LIMIT 
FOR ABORTIONS FROM TWENTY FOUR WEEKS TO TWENTY TWO 
OR LOWER 
THAT IS A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS SO 
FAR MORE ON THE B. B. C. NEWS CHANNEL 
THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON 
THIS FRIDAY AFTER LOSING A HIGH 
COURT BATTLE WAGED BY THE SPEAKER 
OF THE COMMONS WHAT M. P.'S HAVE BEEN 
SPENDING ON THEIR SECOND HOMES WILL 
BE LAID BEAR BUT AS REGULARS OF 
THE POLITICS SHOW WILL KNOW WE'VE 
BEEN CARRYING OUT OUR OWN 
INVESTIGATIONS OVER WHAT EXPENSES 
M. P.'S SHOULD BE ABLE TO CLAIM OVER 
THE PAST WEEKS THERE HAVE BEEN 
DAMAGING HEADLINES ABOUT MEMBERS 
EMPLOYING THEIR OWN FAMILIES AND 
HOW THEY CAN FURNISH THOSE SECOND 
HOMES NOW BOB JUDE AND MARGARET 
ARE BACK WITH THEIR REPORT WHICH 
THEY'LL PUT TO HORM HAD HARRIET 
HARMAN IN JUST A MOMENT SO LET'S 
SEE WHAT THEY HAVE COME UP WITH 
THE PANEL ARE BACK AND IT'S WEEK 
TWO 
SO COMPROMISE TO BE HAD IN TWO LOTS OF AREAS THAT'S WHERE WE 
DISAGREE THE SALARY AND THE 
EXPENSES 
IT'S BEEN HARD WORK TO EXPENSES SORT OUT M. P.S' PAY AND EXPENSES 
WHAT DO WE WANT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO 
WANT TO DO THE JOB 
WHAT WOULD YOU 
LIKE INSTEAD 
BUT HAVE THEY DELIVERED 
IT'S THE POLITICIANS' TURN TO FACE 
OUR PANEL BUT WILL OUR TEAM STAND 
UP TO THE PROFESSIONALS WILL THE 
M. P.'S GET A WORD IN EDGE WAYS WILL 
ANYBODY GET ANY ANSWERS LET'S FIND 
OUT OUT WHAT CAN M. P.'S CLAIM FOR WELL 
THERE'S TRAVEL STAFFING 
INCIDENTALLY AND WINDING UP 
ALLOWANCES RESETTLEMENT 
STATIONARY AND TRAVEL ALLOWANCES 
AND THE DAGSIAL COSTS ALLOWANCE 
THAT PAYS FOR SECOND HOME MORTGAGES 
A NEW KITCHEN PERHAPS WHAT ABOUT 
NEST OF RUGS AND A NEW TELLY TORY 
M. P. PETER LUFF AND HIS SECRETARY 
AND WIFE JULIA HAVE AGREED TO BE 
GRILLED BY OUR PANEL THE TAXPAYER 
STUMPS UP FOR JULIA'S WAGES SNOUTS 
IN THE TROUGH CRITICS SAY CAN 
PETER DEFEND IT 
THE EXPENSES HELP 
US WITH OUR JOB THEY ARE NOT FOR 
PERSONAL GAIN TO A MEMBER OF 
PARLIAMENT 
WHY HAVE THE PUBLIC PARLIAMENT SUCH A PROBLEM AS FAR AS TRUST GOES 
WITH THE M. P.'S 
THERE IS A PROBLEM 
AND IT IS COMPLICATED BECAUSE WE 
HAVE DIFFICULT JOBS AND WE'VE BEEN 
SECRETIVE ABOUT OUR EXPENSES WE 
CAN ADDRESS BITS OF IT BY BEING 
MORE OPEN ABOUT OUR EXPENSES THE THE POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE IN STAFFING IS 
HUGE AND CAN THAT THE NOT BE 
ELIMINATED BY SIMPLY SAYING NO 
MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY 
THAT WOULD 
BE AN INCREDIBLE THING TO DO WE'RE 
NOT TRYING TO CHEAT THE SYSTEM 
WE'RE TRYING TO RUN THE SYSTEM ONE I WOULD BE COMPLETELY LOST WITHOUT 
JULIA AND I WOULDN'T SEE HER WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT M. P.'S HAVING 
SECOND JOBS 
I WOULD SAY YOU SHOULD 
BE OBLIGED TO KEEP YOUR OLD JOB 
GOING FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS A WEEK 
WE HAVE DOCTORS AND DENTISTS WHO 
CONTINUE TO PRACTISE ON SATURDAYS 
AND KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALK BEING 
HOW 
IT IMPACT ON YOUR LIFE AT 
A WHOLE 
IT TAKE IT IS OVER 
COMPLETELY BECAUSE IT TOUCHES EVERY 
CORNER OF YOUR LIFE YOUR M. P. WILL 
BE WORKING VERY VERY LONG HOURS 
AND HE OR SHE WILL NEVER BE WORKING 
HARD ENOUGH SOMEBODY WILL SAY THEY 
SHOULD BE WORKING HARDER SO THE 
FAMILY AND OTHERS ALWAYS TAKE 
SECOND PLACE YOU CANNOT GET A 
PERFECT BALANCE SO IT IMPACTS 
ENORMOUSLY THEYVE DONE IT AFTER ENORMOUSLY THEY'VE DONE IT AFTER HOURS OF DELIBERATION THE PANEL ARE 
OFF TO PRESENT THEIR REPORT TO NICK 
HARVEY THE M. P. TASKED WITH SORTING 
IT OUT HOW WILL THEIR IDEAS GO 
DOWN WILL NICK BE IMPRESSED BY OUR 
PANEL THE SIXTY THOUSAND SALARY GOES UP 
TO SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND TO MATCH SENIOR PUBLIC 
SECTOR WORKERS IN ADDITION COSTS 
WILL BE ADDED TO THEIR PAY THAT'S 
NINETY SIX THOUSAND BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY 
FOR SECOND HOMES OUT OF THEIR 
POCKETS 
ARE YOU SURPRISED WE'VE POCKETS GIVEN YOU A PAY INCREASE 
WE GET 
HAMMERED IN THE NEWSPAPERS FOR WHAT 
WE'RE GETTING ALREADY AND I SAW 
YOUR INTERVIEW WITH KELVIN 
MACKENZIE WHAT DO YOU THINK THE 
FRONT PAGES WOULD LOOK LIKE IF WE 
GAVE OURSELVES THE SORT OF PAY RISE 
YOU'RE DESCRIBING HE WOULD WHIP 
OUR BACKSIDE OVER IT WE HAVE NOT 
REACHED A CONCLUSION YET ON THIS 
SO I'M VERY VERY INTERESTED INDEED 
THAT A PANEL DRAWN FROM A CROSS 
SECTION OF THE PUBLIC ACTUALLY 
THINKS THAT IS THE WAY TO GO IT'S 
A FASCINATING FINDING ON YOUR PART 
M. P.'S EMPLOYING FAMILY THAT WOULD BE 
BANNED BY OUR PANEL AND STAFFING 
ALLOWANCE IS ABOLISHED 
WE DON'T 
THINK M. P.'S SHOULD EMPLOY ANY FAMILY 
MEMBERS 
THESE PEOPLE ARE WORKING MEMBERS AT WAY BELOW THE MARKET RATE AND 
THE TAXPAYER GETS A THUMPING GOOD 
VALUE FOR THEM L. AGREE THEY OUGHT 
TO COME FROM A COMPETITIVE AND 
INTERVIEW PROCESS RATHER THAN JUST 
BE GIVEN THE JOB I AGREE WITH THAT 
BUT I THINK YOU'D FIND IN MOST 
CASES THEY WOULD COME THROUGH ANY 
INTERVIEW WITH FLYING COLOURS 
AND EVERYTHING SHOULD BE RECEIPTED 
AUDITED AND ON LINE 
THE EXPENSES 
SYSTEM IS SECRETIVE AND 
UNACCOUNTABLE IT'S AN OUTRAGE WE 
WANT EVERY PENNY TO BE ACCOUNTED 
FOR 
I PERSONALLY FIND IT FOR UNACCEPTABLE INDEED THAT ON A 
QUARTERLY OR OTHER BASIS WE SHOULD 
GET DOWN TO A RECEIPT LEVEL OF WHAT 
TOILET ROLLS THERE ARE WHAT COLOUR 
I'VE PUT ON MY WALL ET CETERA AND 
THAT'S THE REASON WHY M. P.'S HAVE BEEN 
DEFENSIVE ABOUT THIS 
AND SOMETHING 
NEW PERFORMANCE MEASURES WE WOULD 
HAVE TO RATE HOW WELL OR HOW BADLY 
OUR M. P.'S ARE DOING THEIR JOBS AND 
THEY MIGHT EVEN GET A BONUS 
ACTUALLY TO HAVE SOME REGULAR 
FEEDBACK YOU'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH 
OF THIS AND TOO MUCH OF THAT I 
THINK M. P.'S WOULD FIND WELCOMING 
SOME OF THOSE THINGS CAN BE DONE 
SYSTEMATICALLY I CAN GUARANTEE 
THAT THE IDEAS YOU'VE COME FORWARD 
WITH WILL BE FED INTO OUR REVIEW 
AND LOOKED AT 
HAVE YOU SET OUT 
WHAT YOU STARTED TO ACHIEVE YES YES WE HAVE WE'VE DONE THE BEST JOB IN 
THE TIME AVAILABLE I'VE LEARNT 
THAT POLITICIANS CAN TALK AND TALK 
AND SAY ABSOLUTELY NOTHING MOST OF 
THE TIME 
YES I THINK WE'VE DONE A 
PRETTY GOOD JOB THE REST IS UP TO 
THE M. P.'S 
IT WAS A PRETTY TALL ORDER 
TO COME UP WITH THESE 
RECOMMENDATIONS HOW DO YOU THINK 
YOU DID 
WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE FROM 
DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND DIFFERENT 
VIEWS IT'S HARD WORK BUT WE'VE 
JUST SCRATCHED THE SURFACE BUT I 
THINK WE'VE COME UP WITH SOME 
COMMON SENSE IDEAS I'M SCEPTICAL 
THAT THEY'LL LOOK AT THEM BUT I 
THINK WE'VE DONE AS WELL AS WE 
COULD 
OUR PANEL CAME UP WITH AT COULD LEAST A DOZEN RECOMMENDATIONS AND 
YOU CAN READ THEM ON OUR WEBSITE IN 
FULL BUT SOME OF THE MAIN POINTS 
THEY WANT TO INCREASE THE SALARYS 
TO SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND THE SORT OF MONEY THAT 
POLICE SUPERINTENDENT GET BUT THEY 
SAY AN INDEPENDENT PANEL SHOULD BE 
DECIDING ON THE LEVELS OF PAY AND 
THE M. P.'S SHOULD PAY FOR SOME OF THAT 
RATHER THAN THE TAXPAYER AND THEY 
ALSO WANT TO ABOLISH THE TWENTY THOUSAND 
COST ALLOWANCE WHICH MANY M. P.'S USE 
TO PAY FOR THEIR SECOND HOME IN 
LONDON AND JUST ADD IT TO BASIC 
PAY AND TAX IT AND OUR PANEL WANTS 
AN M. P.'S PAY TO REFLECT HOW WELL 
THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB AND THEY 
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SOME SORT OF 
PERFORMANCE RELATED BONUS L. THEY 
WANT A COMPLETE BAN ON M. P.'S 
EMPLOYING MEMBERS OF THEIR OWN 
FAMILIES AND THEY USED TO BE ABLE 
TO CLAIM UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AT A TIME 
WITHOUT A RECEIPT AND THEY CAN 
STILL DO SO UP TO FIVE BUT THE PANEL 
WANTED ALL RECEIPTS JOINING US IS 
HARRIET HARMAN WELCOME TO THE 
POLITICS SHOW AND PANEL THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH FOR DOING THIS THIS IS 
THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WE'LL 
HAND TO YOU ARE THEY 
RECOMMENDATIONS YOU COULD SIGN UP 
TO 
THEY'RE VERY INTERESTING VERY TO INTERESTING AND I WOULD BE HAPPY 
TO TALK THROUGH EACH ONE OF THEM 
BUT I THINK IT HAS BEEN A VERY GOOD 
PROCESS 
AND JUST ON THAT ONE YOU PROCESS WERE ABLE TO CLAIM TWO HUNDRED FIFTY WORTH OF 
EXPENSES WITHOUT A RECEIPT NOW IT 
IS TWENTY FIVE ANYONE IN ANY WALK OF LIFE 
WHEREVER THEY ARE EVEN IF THEY 
HAVE TO PUT IN A CLAIM OF TWO POINT FIVE OH FOR 
A CUP OF COFFEE YOU HAVE TO PUT IN 
A RECEIPT WHY SHOULD M. P.'S BE 
DIFFERENT 
IT WAS RECOGNISED THAT DIFFERENT THE IT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FUING WAS TOO HIGH AND 
BRINGING IT DOWN WAS REASONABLE AND 
SENSIBLE THE THING IS IF YOU GO 
OUT AND BUY A NOTE PAD OR A NEW SET 
OF PENS IS IT WORTH THE PUBLIC 
EXPENSE OF ACTUALLY LOOKING THROUGH 
ALL OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL RECEIPTS 
SO THAT YOU KEEP ALL THE 
INFORMATION YOURSELF 
AND THERE 
COULD BE SPOT CHECKS 
I SUSPECT 
YOU SHOULD HAVE TO PROVE IT WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT 
WHAT CONCERNS 
ME IS WHY YOU SEE YOU FEEL YOU 
SHOULD BE DIFFERENT O. THE REST OF 
US IN TERMS OF KEET RECEIPTS L. 
HAVE HAVE HAD TO PRODUCE RECEIPTS 
FOR EVERYTHING I DO IN MY WORK 
SOME PRIVATE COMPANIES HAVE A LEVEL 
BELOW WHICH YOU ARE ONLY BUYING 
SOMETHING THAT IS WORTH SMALL 
AMOUNT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT IN THE 
RECEIPT BUT THERE IS THERE IS 
QUESTION ABOUT THE COST OF GOING 
THROUGH ALL OF THESE RECEIPTS WHICH 
IS A GENUINE QUESTION BECAUSE IN 
TERMS OF THE AMOUNT IT COSTS TO RUN 
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS DO YOU WANT 
AN ARMY OF PEOPLE GOING THROUGH 
RECEIPTS FOR SOMETHING THAT COST 
THREE POINT FIVE OH OR RATHER PAY THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS CLEANERS MORE OR HAVE 
BETTER MORE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS RESEARCH DEPARTMENT IN THE 
LIBRARY SO I THINK THAT IT YOU 
KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU HAVE 
TO GET CUT OFF POINT AND THE 
QUESTION IS WHERE THERE IS A 
REASONABLE CUT OFF POINT WE DO 
HAVE TO HAVE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE ON 
IT THAT IS IMPORTANT 
THE COST OF 
THAT CAN'T BE MEASURED WE DON'T 
WANT CART BLANCH PAYMENT WITH 
LITTLE OR NEW SCRUTINY 
IF M. P.'S KEEP 
THEIR RECEIPTS BUT THERE IS A 
SUSPICION ALL THESE TWENTY HAVE BEEN 
ADDING UP AND SOMEBODY HAS BEEN UP 
TO NO GOOD THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE 
INFORMATION BUT FOR IT TO BE PUT IN 
ALL THE TIME I THINK THAT THAT 
MIGHT BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAT WAS 
WORTHWHILE 
I KNOW YOU HAD A WORTHWHILE SPECIFIC QUESTION YOU WANTED TO ASK 
SHOULDN'TN'T THERE BE A BAN ON M. P.'S 
EMPLOYING THEIR OWN FAMILY 
AT THE 
MOMENT THERE ISN'T BUT WHAT THERE 
IS IS A REQUIREMENT NOW THAT YOU 
HAVE TO DISCLOSE IT SO IT HAS TO BE 
MADE PUBLIC THERE IS A REGISTER 
M. P.'S HAVE TO SAY IF THEY ARE 
EMPLOYING A MEMBER OF THEIR FAMILY 
WHAT HAPPENED LOTS OF M. P.'S EMPLOY 
FAMILY MEMBERS SOME OF WHOM HAVE 
ARE WORKING AT BELOW THE RATE TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
THEY COULD GET IN THE OUTSIDE WORD 
AND WORK INCREDIBLY HARD THERE IS 
A QUESTION ABOUT PUBLIC TRUST AND 
CONFIDENCE BECAUSE ONE PARTICULAR 
M. P. DEREK CONWAY WAS YOU KNOW 
CLEARLY ABUSING THE SYSTEM AND 
GIVING MONEY TO HIS FAMILY WHEN 
THEY WEREN'T WORKING HARD FOR IT 
AND THAT WAS AN ABUSE OF PUBLIC 
FUNDS SO I THINK WE HAVE GOT TO A 
SITUATION WHERE IT IS TRANSPARENT 
IT HAS BEEN PUT IN THE OPEN BUT 
THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT 
THERE SHOULD BE AN OUTRIGHT BAN IS 
SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW IS SUBJECT 
TO THIS REVIEW THAT IS HAPPENING AT 
THE MOMENT WHICH IS GOING A 
DECISION WILL BE MADE BY JULY ON 
THE ONE HAND IT SEEMS A BIT 
ARBITRARY TO SAY YOU CAN'T EMPLOY 
YOUR RELATIVES BUT ON THE OTHER 
HAND IT DOESN'T PEOPLE WOULDN'T 
THINK IT WAS A FAIR RECRUITMENT 
PROCESS WHAT ABOUT THIS IDEA OF 
M. P.'S NOT BEING ABLE TO EARN OUTSIDE OUTSIDE OF WHAT THEY GET AS THEIR SALARY 
FOR AN M. P. SOME OF THE M. P.'S ARE 
EARNING EYE WATERING SUMS OF MONEY 
OUTSIDE OF PARLIAMENT 
I EMPLOY 
THREE HARD WORKING MEMBERS OF STAFF 
IN MY OFFICE HELPING ME WITH MY 
CASE WORK FOR MY CONSTITUENTS IF 
HAD OTHER JOB TONS SIDE WHICH PAY 
THEM AN EXTRA ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND L. WOULD 
HAVE A QUESTION MARK AS TO WHETHER 
THEY WERE REALLY WORKING FOR ME L. 
NOTICE THAT IS ONE OF YOUR 
RECOMMENDATION ABOUT OUTSIDE WORK 
AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING WE 
SHOULD LOOK AT THERE IS TWO 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT ONE IS WHAT 
ARE PEOPLE GETTING WHEN THEY ARE 
PAYING M. P.'S ADDITIONALLY IS IT 
INFLUENCING THEM IN A WAY IT 
SHOULDN'T THEY SHOULD ONLY BE 
INFLUENCED TO REPRESENT THEIR 
CITIES WENTS 
ARE YOU IN FAVOUR OF 
THAT LET ME PUSH YOU ON THAT I I THINK PEOPLE WOULD BE MORE 
CONFIDENT IF THEY KNOW M. P.'S ARE 
FOCUSED ON THEIR M. P. JOB NOT 
DISTRACTED BY EARNING LOTS OF MONEY 
TO DO SOMETHING ELSE 
THIS BUSINESS 
OF SECOND HOMES HAS BEEN TAKEN TO 
THE HIGH COURT BY THE COMMONS 
AUTHORITIES BY THE SPEAKER I KNOW 
YOU WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING 
I WANT 
I WANT TO KNOW YOU YOU CAN JUSTIFY 
THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OF PUBLIC MONEY SPENT 
PREVENTING DISCLOSURE RGES THE 
RAIN REASON THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
AUTHORITY APPEALED WAS ABOUT THE 
QUESTION OF ADDRESS BECAUSE THERE 
IS A QUESTION I MEAN PBLGTS I MEAN 
WE HAVE LOST IN THE HIGH COURT AND 
THERE WILL BE CONSIDERATION OF 
THE JUDGMENT IT ONLY HAD AT THE 
END OF LAST WEEK BUT THIS IS THE 
ARGUMENT WE MADE AND LOST IN THE 
COURT 
WHICH IS THAT IF M. P.'S HAVE GOT COURT FLATS IN LONDON YOU KNOW IF YOU U. 
HAVE A CONSTITUENCY IN SCOTLAND 
NORTH WALES YOU TO HAVE SOMEWHERE 
TO LIVE IN LONDON WHEN YOU ARE 
WORKING IN WESTMINSTER AND VOTING 
IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND WHEN 
THE HOUSE IS NOT SITTING DURING 
THE SUMMER RECESS OR SOMETHING LIKE 
THAT THEN EVERYBODY WOULD KNOW 
THAT IF YOUR ADDRESS IS PRINTED 
THEY WOULD KNOW YOUR FLAT WAS EMPTY 
AND THERE IS A SECURITY ISSUE THAT 
IS ONE BLOCK FOR EXAMPLE WHERE I 
THINK ABOUT SEVENTEEN M. P.'S ALL LIVE IN THIS 
BLOCK AND IT MAKES THEM A BIT OF A 
SITTING TARGET IF IT IS ALL 
PUBLISHED AND THE OTHER PEOPLE ARE 
SAYING WE DON'T WANT IT PUBLISHED 
THAT WE HAVE SEVENTEEN MPINGS IN OUR BLOCK 
YOU HAVE MADE YOUR POINT 
WE LOST 
IN THE COURT BUT THAT IS OUR 
ARGUMENT 
DO YOU THINK YOU WILL ARGUMENT APPEAL 
WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION APPEAL ABOUT THAT THE JUDGMENT IS A LONG 
AND DETAILED ONE AND HAVE TO LOOK 
AT IT AND TAKE LEGAL ADVICE L. 
THINK IT WAS WORTH THAT MONEY TO 
PUT FORWARD THE ARGUMENT THAT THERE 
IS A SECURITY ISSUE HERE AND WHAT 
IN WHAT OTHER WALK OF LIFE POLICE 
CHIEFS DON'T HAVE THEIR ADDRESSES 
WHERE THEIR ARE THEY ARE LIVING 
IN THE PAPERS L. KNOW IT LOOKS AS 
IF WE ARE TRYING TO JUST BE TRYING 
TO TAKE MONEY AND NOT BE PREPARED 
TO BE OPEN ABOUT IT BUT IT IS NOT 
ABOUT THE AMOUNTS IT IS THE 
ADDRESSES THAT IS THE KEY THING 
THERE ARE LOTS OF RESOURCES SO YOU 
CAN FIND OUT WHERE M. P.'S LIVE IN IN LONDON THERE ISN'T A PLACE YOU CAN 
FIND OUT WHERE M. P.'S LIVE IN LONDON 
IN THEIR CONSTITUENCY YOU CAN 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO DECLARE IT 
WHEN THEY ARE STANDING FOR ELECTION 
BUT IT IS DIFFERENT PEOPLE ARE AT 
HOME AND IN THEIR COMMUNITY THAN 
IF THEY ARE LIVING ON THEIR OWN IN 
LONDON AND THEIR ADDRESS IS MADE 
PUBLIC 
IF YOU FAIL IN IN REVIEW PUBLIC GETTING IT RIGHT AREN'T THE PUBLIC 
GOING TO BECOME MORE CYNICAL AND 
MORE DISENGAGED FROM THE POLITICAL 
SYSTEM 
I THINK WE DO THIS IS A SYSTEM ROOT AND BRANCH REVIEW IT IS OUR 
CHANCE TO PUT OUR HOUSE IN ORDER 
SHOW ITS ABOVE BOARD MAKE SURE 
THAT WE HAVE GOT THE PROPER SUPPORT 
SERVICES FOR M. P.'S BUT SO THEY CAN DO 
THEIR JOB PROPERLY BUT MAKE SURE 
THE PUBLIC HAVE CONFIDENCE IN IT I I AM GOING TO A FIRST FOR THE 
POLITICS SHOW YOU CAN ASK THEM A 
QUESTION 
RIGHT DID YOUR VIEW OF QUESTION M. P.'S CHANGE IN TERMS OF HOW 
FAVOURABLE YOU WERE OR AGAINST M. P.'S 
YOU WERE DID YOU BECOME MORE 
FAVOURABLE THE MORE YOU LOOKED INTO 
IT OR MORE HOSTILE THE MORE YOU 
LOOKED INTO IT ARE WE BETTER THAN 
YOU THOUGHT WE WERE 
WE ONLY SAW A 
COUPLE OF M. P.'S IT DIDN'T INFLUENCE 
ME EITHER WAY THEY DO A IMPORTANT 
JOB THEY HAVE A GREAT 
RESPONSIBILITY AND SHOULD BE PAID 
APPROPRIATELY I DON'T THINK THAT 
EXCEPT EXEMPTS THEM FROM EVERY 
SYSTEM EVERYBODY ELSE HAS TO BE A 
BIDE BE 
ON THE WHOLE TALKING TO 
THEM I FOUND THEM SLITHRY AND 
DIDN'T WANT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS 
DIDN'T WANT THE PUBLIC NOSE IN MY 
BUSINESS 
DO YOU THINK SHE HAS BUSINESS ANSWERED YOUR QUESTIONS TODAY BY 
THE WAY 
WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO 
PROBE 
THERE WAS A TELLING PAUSE PROBE THERE THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH FOR 
TAKING THE TIME OUT DO THIS IT HAS 
BEEN AN INTERESTING PROCESS L. KNOW 
YOU WILL STAY WITH US FOR A BIT 
LONGER BUT JUST TO SAY IF YOU HAVE 
BEEN INSPIRED BY WATCHING JUDE AND 
BOB GET STUCK IN PERHAPS YOU WOULD 
LIKE TO TAKE PART IN ANOTHER 
POLITIC SHOW CHALLENGE IN A FEW 
WEEKS THE GOVERNMENT WILL PUBLISH A 
REVIEW ABOUT HOW OUR PERSONAL DATA 
IS USED THEY ALL INVOLVE HANDING 
IT OVER TO SOMEONE THE POLITICS 
SHOW IS LOOKING FOR A FAMILY WHO 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THEY CAN AVOID 
THE GAZE OF THE SURVAUIANS SOCIETY 
FOR A WHOLE WEEK IF YOU ARE UP FOR 
IT YOU CAN SEE DETAILS ON THE 
WEBSITE IF YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS OF 
THE WEB YOU CAN WRITE TO US BE IN 
NO DOUBT WHAT POLITICAL STORY WILL 
DOMINATE THE HEADLINES THIS WEEK 
AND NEXT LAST TIME THE 
CONSERVATIVES GAIN ADD SEAT FROM 
LABOUR AT BY ELECTION WAS BACK IN 
NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT I WAS IN SHORT TROUSERS 
ALMOST THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN 
OUT IN CREWE AND AMP NANTWICH ALL WEEK 
DAVID CAMERON WAS THERE ON THURSDAY 
AS YOU CAN SEE AS WAS THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRAT LEADER NICK CLEGG BOTH 
SENSING LABOUR COULD BE IN TROUBLE 
THERE AND JACK STRAW HAS BEEN THERE 
TOO GORDON BROWN DOESN'T DO 
ELECTION CAMPAIGNS BUT THE 
POLITICS SHOW NORTH WEST POLITICAL 
EDITOR HAS BEEN CAMPED OUT THIS 
WEEK HOW IS IT LOOKING UP THERE 
IT IS LOOKING VERY TIGHT INDEED 
LOOK THIS SHOULD BEED SO LIL 
SOLID LABOUR TERRITORY THE TORIES 
WOULD NEED AN EIGHT PER CENT SWING TO TAKE THIS 
SEAT OF CREWE AND AMP NANTWICH BUT IF YOU 
TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE TWO TOWNS ONE 
MESSAGE COMES OVER TIME AND TIME 
AGAIN WHAT COULD LOSE THE SEAT FOR 
LABOUR IT'S THE TEN PENCE TAX 
DEBACLE AND THE ISSUE OF THE RISING 
COST OF LIVING THE CONSERVATIVES 
ARE MINING THOSE TWO ISSUE AND THE 
U. TURN OVER THE TEN PENCE TAX 
DOESN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE THE 
LABOUR ARE PLAYING THE OF THE CARD 
THEY ARE SAYING HE WON'T REPRESENT 
THE PEOPLE LIKE THEIR CANDIDATE 
TAMSIN DUNWOODY SHE IS THE 
DAUGHTER OF THE FORMER LABOUR HERE 
GWYNETH DUNWOODY THE YOU HAVE 
ELIZABETH SHENTON FOR THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS THEY WERE THIRD LAST 
TIME I SUSPECT THEY WILL BE THIRD 
THIS TIME DECEMBER I WAS OUT 
WITH TAMSIN DUNWOODY EARLIER THIS 
WEEK AND THERE WAS A FASCINATING 
EXCHANGE WITH A LABOUR VOTER 
SOMEBODY WHO IS STAYING WITH THE 
PARTY THAT CHAP SAID YOU EXPECT 
THE CONSERVATIVES TO PUT A FOOT ON 
YOUR THROAT RUB YOUR NOSE IN THE 
DIRT AND TURN ROUND AND SAY THANK 
YOU BUT YOU DON'T EXPECT IT FROM 
YOUR OWN MOB THAT IS HOW ANGRY 
PEOPLE ARE AND THOSE LABOUR VOTERS 
ARE LOOKING TO MOVE STRAIGHT FROM 
LABOUR TO CONSERVATIVE THEY DON'T 
SEEM TO BE AT THE MOMENT STOPPING 
WITH THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ON THE 
WAY IT WILL BE VERY CLOSE ONE THOUSAND 
VOTES EITHER WAY SAID ONE LABOUR 
ORGANISER ERIC PICKLES SAID VERY 
CLOSE HOLD YOUR HATS FOR THURSDAY 
IT WILL BE VERY TIGHT 
IT PROMISES 
TO BE FASCINATELING YOU WILL 
REMEMBER WE SPOKE TO THE 
CONSERVATIVES ABOUT THEIR CHANCES 
ON THE PROGRAMME THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS ARE THE TRADITIONAL BY 
ELECTION SPECIAL LISTS AND CHRIS 
HUHNE IS UP THERE FOR THEM TODAY 
THANKS YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH 
US THERE USED TO BE A TIME WHEN WE 
WOULD HEAR ABOUT LABOUR LIBERAL 
DEMOCRAT BAND WAGONS ROLLING IT 
SEEMS TO BE AS STATIONERY AS THAT 
TRAIN BEHIND YOU 
WELL IF I HAD FIVE 
FOR EVERY TIME I HEARD THE 
COMMENTATORS SAY IT WASN'T ROLLING 
AT BY ELECTION IT WOULD BE RICH 
THERE H. ARE A LOT OF LABOUR 
SUPPORTERS WHO ARE NOW SAYING HANG 
ON WE ARE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR THE 
LABOUR PARTY THIS TIME BECAUSE WE 
KNOW THAT THEY HAVE LET US DOWN 
BOTH LOCALLY AND LET US DOWN FOR 
EXAMPLE ON DOUBLING THE TEN PENCE 
TAX RATE ON SOME OF THE LOWEST PAID 
BUT THE CONSERVATIVES DIDN'T OPPOSE 
THAT WHEN IT CAME UP IN PARTICLE 
SO A LOT OF LABOUR PEOPLE WILL BE 
THINKING ABOUT VOTING LIBERAL 
DEMOCRAT IN THE RUN UP TO THURSDAY 
AND I BELIEVE THERE WILL BE A VERY 
PLEASANT SURPRISE FOR OUR CANDIDATE 
ON THURSDAY 
BECAUSE YOU DUMPED 
YOUR ORGEAL ONE OF HE E. MAILED US 
TO SAY THE SELECTION PROCESS IS A 
SHAM AND I AM SEETHING WITH ANGER 
THE FROM ARE THE PARTY THAT 
BELIEVES IN ACCIDENTALLYISATION WE WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD A SPECIAL PROCESS 
AS ALL THE PARTIES DO FOR BY 
ELECTION CANDIDATE RECOGNISING 
THAT BY ELECTIONS ARE A SPECIAL 
SORT OF ELECTION AND THERE IS 
INEVITABLY AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF 
PRESSURE PUT ON CANDIDATES AND THAT 
IS SOMETHING ALL THE PARTIES 
RECOGNISE AND I AM AFRAID THAT IS 
THE CASE WITH US AS WELL 
THANK YOU 
UP IN CREWE AND HARRIET HARMAN IS 
STILL US WITH WE HEARD FROM OUR 
NORTH WEST POLITICAL EDITOR ABOUT 
THIS OF THE CAMPAIGN YOU HAVE BEEN 
RUNG AND STEVE MCCAIN HAS TALKED 
ABOUT THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE AS 
BEING FROM AN A VERY PRIVILEGED 
BACKGROUND WHAT IS EXCESSIVELY 
PRIVILEGED 
WHAT 
THEY ARE SAYING IS PRIVILEGED THEY ARE PUTTING A SPOTLIGHT ON THE 
DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO CANNED 
DATES 
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT COMPEBG DATES IT IS EXCESSIVE PRIVILEGE IS I I THINK HE IS A MULTI MILLIONAIRE 
HIS PARENTS ARE HE IS BARRISTER 
SO YOUR PARENTS BACKGROUND COUNT 
IT IS TO BE USED AGAINST YOU I I THINK IT IS HIS OWN PERSONAL 
SITUATION AND WE ARE PUTTING FOCUS 
ON OUR CANDIDATE TAMSIN WHO IS 
HARD WORKING MOTHER OF FIVE AND WE 
THINK WOULD BE THE BEST 
REPRESENTATIVE FOR CREWE AND AMP NANTWICH 
YOU ARE THE NIECE OF THE COUNTESS 
OF LONGED FOR YOU WENT TO THE 
POSHEST GIRLS SCHOOL IN THE COUNTRY 
WHICH GETS THE BEST PRIVATE SCHOOL 
RESULTS DOES THAT MAKE YOU 
EXCESSIVELY PRIVILEGED 
I HAVE NEVER 
MADE ANY ISSUE ABOUT MY BACKGROUND 
WE THINK TAMSIN IS THE BEST 
CANDIDATE AND YOU KNOW WE ARE 
PUTTING THE FOCUS ON HER AND HOW 
SHE WOULD 
GOOD PERSON TO BE 
THE M. P. FOR CREWE AND AMP NANTWICH THAT THAT IS THE FRONT PAGE OF YOUR WEBSITE 
DO YOU THINK THAT IS MOSSTIVE 
POSITIVE CAMPAIGNING 
IT IS NOT THE 
MOST POSITIVE MOST IS FOCUSED ON 
THE GOOD THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE 
LAST TEN YEARS SINCE LABOUR HAS 
BEEN IN GOVERNMENT AND OUR PLANS 
FOR THE FUTURE AND OUR GOOD 
CANDIDATE T. THAT IS THE BEST WAY 
FORWARD 
NOT THE BEST POSITIVE L. FORWARD SENSE YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE WITH 
THIS CAMPAIGN 
IT IS THE NOT THE 
MAIN FOCUS YOU HAVE TAKEN THAT 
THAT IS THE FRONT PAGE OF THE 
WEBSITE 
IT IS NOT THE MAIN FOCUS WEBSITE THE MAIN FOCUS IS SAM TAMSIN IS 
AN EXCELLENT CANDIDATE AND YOU KNOW 
WE THINK SHE WOULD BE THE BEST 
PERSON TO BE REPRESENTATIVE FOR 
CREWE AND AMP NANTWICH AND WE ARE PROUD 
OF WHAT THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT HAS 
DONE OVER THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS AND 
HAVE GOT A GOOD PROGRAMME FOR THE 
TUE FUTURE 
THIS IS ANOTHER LEAFLET THAT HAS 
BEEN PUT OUT IT SAYS TORY BOY 
APPLICATION FORM DO YOU THINK A 
RE THINK IS ADDING ANOTHER WING TO 
YOUR MANSION WE'VE SEEN WHERE 
TAMSIN DUNWOODY LIVES AND WE THINK 
IF LOOKS LIKE MANSION AS WELL IS 
THIS NOT JUST GOING BACK TO THE 
CLASS ERA 
WELL UNDER THE TORIES 
THERE WAS MASS UNEMPLOYMENT AND 
PEOPLE AT THE BOTTOM OF SOCIETY 
WERE SUFFERING ESPECIALLY WITH THE 
RESESSIONS AND LABOUR HAS CUT 
UNEMPLOYMENT AND ENSURING WE HAVE 
GOOD PUBLIC SERVICES AND THAT IS 
WHAT WE STAND FOR AND THAT IS WHEN 
WE'RE ILLUSTRATING 
ARE YOU WORRIED 
THAT THE POLLS BOOK BAD FOR YOU 
IT'S NOT GOOD SECOND GUESSING THE 
DECISION TO BE MADE BY THE PEOPLE 
OF CREWE AND NANTWICH ON THURSDAY 
TAMSIN DUNWOODY WHO YOU SPEAK SO 
HIGHLY OF THEE WAS ASKED ON 
YOUTUBE THREE TIMES DO YOU THINK 
GORDON BROWN IS A GOOD PERSON FOR 
YOUR CAMPAIGN SHE CAN'T SEEM TO 
SAY A GOOD WORD FOR GORDON BROWN 
ISN'T THAT THE PROBLEM YOU FACE IN 
THE COUNTRY 
NOT AT ALL WHAT 
TAMSIN DUNWOODY IS SAYING IS SHE IS 
IT IS THE ONE RUNNING FOR THE BY 
ELECTION IN CREWS CREWE AND 
NANTWICH NOT GORDON BROWN BUT I 
HAVE ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE IN GORDON 
BROWN WHO HAS STEERED THE COUNTRY 
THROUGH DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES IN 
THE PAST AND IS THE RIGHT PERSON 
FOR GOING FORWARD WHEN WE HAVE THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH COMING FROM AMERICA 
AND DO YOU ACCEPT THERE ARE 
RUMBLINGS IN THE CORRIDORS OF 
WESTMINSTER OVER HOW FIT AND 
SUITABLE HE IS TO CARRY ON 
I'M NOT 
GOING TO HIGH POTH THIGHS OVER WHAT 
THE RESULTS OF THURSDAY WILL BE 
AND WHATEVER THE RESULTS AND I DO 
HOPE WE HAVE TAMSIN BECAUSE I 
THINK SHE WILL BE BY FAR THE BEST 
REPRESENTATIVE FOR THAT AREA WE'RE 
GOING TO GET ON THE JOB THAT OUR 
PUBLIC SERVICES CONTINUE TO IMPROVE 
AND PEOPLE CAN GET ON WITH OUR 
LIVES THAT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE TEN 
CANDIDATES FOR THE CREWE AND 
NANTWICH BY ELECTION AND THEY WILL 
ALL BE ON OUR WEBSITE AND WE'LL 
HAVE A SPECIAL PROGRAMME ON B. B. C. TWO 
AND B. B. C. NEWS CHANNEL ON THURSDAY 
NIGHT AND IT WILL RUN ALL THROUGH 
THE NIGHT IT SHOULD BE FASCINATING 
NOW THE POLITICS SHOW WHERE YOU 
ARE 
WELCOME TO CITY HALL LATER ON 
TODAY WHAT BORIS MEANS FOR LONDON 
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WILL THE PLANNED LEGACY OF 
REGENERATION IN EAST LONDON WITH 
DOWNGRADED IN FAVOUR OF GREATER 
SPORTING PARTICIPATION ACROSS THE 
CAPITAL CAPITAL FIRST ONE OF THE MOST REST NON ANT 
PLEDGES OF BOREY JOHNSON'S CAMPAIGN 
WAS TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SAFER HE 
IS HARDLY THE FIRST TO RUN ON THIS 
CAMPAIGN BUT IT HAS ELUDED 
POLITICIANS FOR SOME TIME THIS 
WEEK THE NEW MAYOR MADE 
IMMEDIATELY GOOD ONE OF HIS 
SPECIFIC PROMISES THE DEPLOYMENT 
OF MORE UNIFORMED OFFICERS ON THE 
TRANSPORT NETWORK 
WE REPORT ON WHAT DIFFERENCE IT IS 
LIKELY TO MAKE 
JUST A FEW DAYS AFTER COMING INTO 
OFFICE OUR NEW MAYOR ANNOUNCED 
THAT FROM JUNE FIRST ALCOHOL WOULD BE 
BANNED ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT ON 
THURSDAY HE WAS AT THE ELEPHANT AND AMP 
CASTLE LOOKING AT SCANNERS USED FOR 
FINDING WEAPONS AND HAS PROMISED 
THAT MORE WILL BE INSTALLED AT 
TRANSPORT HUBS AND HE SAID THERE 
WOULD BE AN EXTRA FOUR HUNDRED FORTY OFFICERS ON 
LONDON BUSES IN THE COMING WEEKS 
PEOPLE CAN EXPECT MORE DETAILS ON 
THE MAYOR'S FRONT BORIS JOHNSON'S 
ATTEMPT TO GET WEALTHY BUSINESS 
PEOPLE TO SPEND MORE ON FACILITIES 
FOR YOUNGSTERS AND MISBEHAVING 
TEENAGERS WILL WIN BACK THEIR RIGHT 
TO FREE TRAVEL ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
THROUGH COMMUNITY SERVICE BUT THE 
MAYOR THINKS THERE IS A GOOD CASE 
FOR MORE TRANSFER OF POWER TO HIS 
OFFICE 
THERE IS A PROCESS IN PLACE OFFICE BY WHICH THE MAYOR HAS A ROLE IN 
DECIDING WHO THE COMMISSIONER 
SHOULD BE AND I DO THINK THERE IS 
AN ARGUMENT FOR LOOKING AT THE WAY 
THAT PROCESS WORKS TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THE PEOPLE OF LONDON ARE MORE 
EFFECTIVELY INVOLVED IN THAT 
PROCESS 
AND THE CHIEF CONSTABLE PROCESS AGREES THAT THE MAYOR HAS THE RIGHT 
TO INFLUENCE THE POLICE 
WE HAVE TO 
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE MAYOR IS 
ELECTED AND VOTED FOR BY OVER A 
MILLION PEOPLE AND WE ARE ALWAYS 
GOING TO BE TAKING THE VIEW THE 
DEMOCRATIC MANDATE THAT'S WHAT WE 
DID WITH THE LAST MAYOR AND WE WILL 
WITH THIS ONE AND WE HAVE A VERY 
GOOD RELATIONSHIP 
BORIS JOHNSON 
HAS WASTED NO TIME IN SHOWING THAT 
TACKLING CRIME IS HIS PRIORITY 
WHETHER HE HAS THE POWER TO DO SO 
IS SOMETHING WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND 
SEE JOINING ME IS DAWN BUTLER 
LABOUR M. P. FOR BRENT SOUTH AND 
LABOUR'S VICE CHAIRMAN FOR YOUTH 
AND THE YOUTH WORKER AND 
CONSERVATIVE PERSPECTIVE 
PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATE SEAN BAYLY 
FOR HAMMERSMITH LET'S START WITH 
THE STORY IN THE PAPERS TODAY THAT 
SAYS THAT SIR IAN BLAIR HAS ALREADY 
BEEN TOLD HIS CONTRACT WILL NOT BE 
RENEWED 
TO BE HONEST IT'S WHETHER RENEWED THE JOB IS BEING DONE PROPERLY AND 
WHETHER WE'RE GETTING THE RESULTS 
WE NEED SO IT'S NOT AN ISSUE OVER 
WHO IS DOING THE JOB BUT WHETHER 
IT IS BEING DONE PROPERLY 
IF YOU 
FELT HE HAD BEEN DOING A PRETTY 
GOOD JOB WOULD IT NOT BE FAIR TO 
GIVE HIM A SECOND TERM 
I THINK 
HE'S DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB HE'S 
MADE SOME MISTAKES BUT THE ISSUE 
IS NOT WHETHER SIR IAIN SHOULD 
CONTINUE IT'S WHO WILL DO A GOOD 
JOB 
DO THINK HIS CONFIDENCE WAS JOB KNOCKED BY THE SHOOTING INCIDENT 
HIS CONFIDENCE WAS KNOCKED BY THAT 
AND THE PUBLIC HAD ISSUES WITH THAT 
SO DID I BUT THE CRUX OF THE 
MATTER IS WHETHER THE POLICE ARE 
DOING A GOOD JOB WHETHER THEY'RE 
BEING FAIR AND HE CAN TABLET ACROSS 
SOCIETY AND THAT IS WHERE WE 
SHOULD FOCUS ON THE POLICE'S ROLE 
IN SOCIETY 
DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD 
GET A SECOND TERM 
THE POINT IS 
THIS WHOEVER RUNS THE POLICE IT'S 
A BIG STEER ON HOW THE POLICE IS 
MADE AND IF HE HAS NOT DONE A GOOD 
JOB HE SHOULD BE REMOVED AND THE 
IMPETUS IS NOW WE NEED PEOPLE WITH 
NEW IDEAS 
HAVE THE PEOPLE LOST 
CONFIDENCE IN HIM 
WELL I DON'T 
SEE PEOPLE JUMPING UP AND DOWN BE 
MOANING HE MIGHT BE LEAVING WHAT WHAT SORT OF MESSAGE WOULD THIS SEND 
THAT BECAUSE OF THE WITCH HUNT 
SURROUNDING HIM THAT AN OFFICER 
COULD BE HOUNDED OUT 
I DON'T 
BELIEVE HE HAS BEEN HOUNDED OUT 
HE'S SURVIVED MANY A WITCH HUNT L. 
DON'T BELIEVE HE IS BEING HOUNDED 
OUT WE DON'T KNOW IF IT IS TRUE 
THAT HE'S GOING 
YOU SAY IT IS TIME FOR CHANGE AND 
YOU IMPETUS WHERE WHAT IS THE NEW 
IMPETUS HE HAS NOT BEEN DELIVERING 
WELL THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF COMMENTS 
ABOUT WHETHER HE IS A POLICEMAN'S 
POLICEMAN AND ALL THE PROBLEMS 
THAT HAVE HAPPENED AND HE HAS BEEN 
THE CHIEF DEALING WITH THAT SO TO 
GET SOMEBODY NEW WITH NEW IDEAS 
BUT CRIME IS COMING DOWN IT IT DEPENDS HOW YOU MEASURE THAT AND 
THE FEELING OF CRIME IS ALMOST AS 
IMPORTANT AS THE REALITY OF CRIME 
BECAUSE IT MANAGES PEOPLE'S 
BEHAVIOUR HE'S COME SO FAR AND 
MAYBE WE NEED TO TRY AND GO FURTHER 
BUT DAWN WE CAN TALK ABOUT 
PEOPLE'S FEELING OF CRIME BUT HOW 
STRONG AN INDICATOR IS THAT 
BECAUSE THE STATISTICS SHOW THAT 
CRIME IS COMING DOWN AND PEOPLE 
SAY PEOPLE DON'T FEEL THAT 
WE HAVE 
TO DO TWO THINGS HERE NUMBER ONE 
WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR THAT THE MEDIA 
IS RESPONSIBLE IN REPORTING CLIMB 
BECAUSE IF THE FACTS SHOW THAT 
CRIME IS COMING DOWN IT IS 
IRRESPONSIBLE WHEN PEOPLE SAY 
CRIME HAS TRIPLED 
BUT THAT'S 
ALWAYS BEEN THE WAY AND YOU'RE NOT 
GOING TO DO BIG ABOUT THAT SO 
LET'S MOVE ON AND ASK HOW DO YOU 
COUNTER PEOPLE'S PER SPEPGSS THAT 
THEY ARE NOT FEELING SAFE 
PERCEPTIONS 
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH PERCEPTIONS IT FAIRLY IN BRENT WE USED TO 
HAVE A SHOOTING EVERY SEVENTEEN DAYS BUT 
THAT IS NO LONGER THE CASE AND IF 
YOU WALK ALONG THE STREETS IN BRENT 
AND TALK TO YOUNG PEOPLE THEY'LL 
TELL YOU THAT THEY FEEL A LITTLE 
BIT SAFER AND THE FEAR IS COMING 
DOWN BUT IF YOU'RE CONSTANTLY 
BOMBARDING THEM WITH HEADLINES THAT 
SAY THERE IS CRIME AND DON'T COME 
OUT OF YOUR DOOR AFTER SIX P. M. YOU'RE 
FUELLING THAT CRIME AND I THINK 
THAT IS IRRESPONSIBLE 
DO YOU THINK 
THESE ARE MEANINGLESS GESTURES BY 
BORIS JOHNSON BANNING ALCOHOL ON 
PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND PUTTING MORE 
OFFICERS ON THE BUSES 
I THINK IT 
IS KEY IF WE'RE TALKING THREE THE FEAR 
OF CRIME WE HAVE TO SEND A MESSAGE 
IF YOU'RE A YOUNG PERSON MUCH OF 
THE CRIME INSTIGATED AMONGST YOUNG 
PEOPLE IS NOT RECORDED AND THAT'S 
WHY THEY HAVE A FEAR OF CRIME SO 
WE NEED TO TAKE CHARGE AND 
PARTICULARLY WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WE 
NEED TO INTERFERE BEFORE THEY TAKE 
UP CRIME AND THAT'S WHY THE ACTION 
ON THE BUSES IS VERY IMPORTANT DO DO SEE THIS AS THE KNIFE CAPITAL OF 
THE WORLD LONDON NOW 
UNFORTUNATELY CERTAINLY OF EUROPE 
AND IT'S NOT UNFORTUNATE THAT I SEE 
IT LIKE THAT IT'S ABOUT OUR YOUNG 
PEOPLE MANY YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR 
ENVIRONMENT DON'T FEEL SAFE THEY 
DON'T THINK ADULTS ARE DEFENDING 
THEM SO THEY FEEL THEY HAVE TO 
DEFEND THEMSELVES 
WERE LABOUR SLOW 
AT TACKLING THIS 
KEN DID A LOT TO 
TACKLE CRIME AND I UNDERSTAND THAT 
THE MONEY HE GOT FROM THE HOME 
OFFICE THAT BORIS IS NOT COMMITTED 
TO SPEND ON YOUTH SERVICE WHICH IS 
A DISGRACE 
WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT 
IS TRUE YET BUT THAT CAME AFTER 
WE'D ALREADY LOST THIRTY LIVES 
BUT THE 
PROBLEM IS MULTI FACETED AND YOU'LL 
HAVE TO FIND MANY SOLUTIONS IT'S 
NOT JUST ABOUT LOCKING YOUNG PEOPLE 
UP AND SENDING THEM TO PRISON 
THERE ARE LOADS OF THINGS WE HAVE 
TO DO BEFORE THAT TO TACKLE IT AND 
THE STUFF THAT BORIS HAS COME OUT 
WITH THE NEW SAFER TRANSPORT TEAMS 
KEN DID THAT LAST YEAR HE'S JUST 
ADDING TO THAT WHICH IS FAIR 
ENOUGH IT'S A GOOD SCHEME AND GIVE 
HIM CREDIT FOR ADDING TO THAT BUT 
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT ALL THE 
INVESTMENT AND THE WORK THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS MADE INTO YOUTH 
SERVICES AND FACILITIES AND YOU'RE 
TALKING ABOUT BILLIONS OF POUNDS 
AND IT GETS LOST BECAUSE IT'S NEVER 
REPORTED BUT IT MAKES A HUGE 
DIFFERENCE TO COMMUNITIES ON THE 
GROUND 
WHAT HAVE YOU SAID TO BORIS GROUND JOHNSON IN A FEW WORDS HE NEEDS TO 
DO IF HE IS GOING TO MAKE A 
MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE ABOUT THE 
PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN TERMS OF YOUTH 
CRIME 
THERE ARE TWO SIDES THE CRIME PREVENTION AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF 
IT AND A LOT OF THE PRE EMPTION 
WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE IN A 
PARTICULAR WAY YOU CAN'T JUST 
CONCENTRATE ON CATCHING PEOPLE 
BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF SOCIETY THAT 
THE AMOUNT OF CRIME THAT SOCIETY 
SUFFERS FROM A LOT OF THE PEOPLE 
IN DETENTION ARE NOT AFRAID OF THE 
POLICE AND ONE PLACE WHERE THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS MISSED OUT ON IS IN 
PRISON THE WAY WE DO NOT EDUCATE 
THEM OR GIVE THEM REHABILITATION OR 
DRUG HELP IS A MASSIVE OPPORTUNITY 
MISSED IN THIS COUNTRY 
THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH 
FORGET CRIME AND TRANSPORT EVEN 
MANY PEOPLE THINK THE OUTCOME OF 
THE NEXT MAYORAL ELECTION WILL 
HINGE LARGELY ON THE STATE OF 
PREPARATIONS FOR LONDON'S OLYMPIC 
GAMES NOT LEAST BECAUSE THE NEXT 
ELECTIONS FALL JUST THREE MONTHS 
BEFORE THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE EVENT IT WILL 
THUS BE SEEN AS A MAJOR TEST FOR 
THE MAYOR'S CONFIDENCE AND AS THE 
OLYMPIC COMMITTEE MEET THIS WEEK TO 
CARRY OUT THE LATEST HEALTH CHECK 
THERE ARE ALREADY SIGNS OF A SHIFT 
DURING THE CLOSING CEREMONY OF THE 
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT GAMES A GLOBAL AUDIENCE OF 
OVER A BILLION PEOPLE WILL WATCH 
BORIS JOHNSON AS HE RECEIVES THE 
OLYMPIC FLAG HE'LL THEN BECOME THE 
INTERNATIONAL AMBASSADOR AS THE 
NEXT HOST CITY WE'VE SEEN SOME OF 
HIS SPORTING PROWESS BUT WHAT DOES 
BORIS JOHNSON THINK ABOUT THE 
OLYMPICS AND WHAT MIGHT HE DO 
DIFFERENTLY TO HIS PREDECESSOR THE 
CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN SCATHING 
ABOUT THE RISING COST OF THE GAMES 
THE COSTS OF THE VELODROME AND THE 
AQUATIC CENTRES HAVE QUAD ROUBLEED 
AND THE NINE POINT THREE BILLION BUDGET LOOKS 
SET TO RISE FURTHER 
BORIS SAYS THE POCKETS OF LONDON 
COUNCIL TAXPAYERS WILL NOT BE 
PICKED BUT HOW HE WILL KEEP THE 
COSTS FROM RISING IS STILL NOT 
CLEAR 
WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THE CLEAR OLYMPIC BUDGET TO DELIVER A 
SENSIBLE PROJECT THAT IS PROPERLY 
COSTED 
AND HOW WILL YOU KEEP IT COSTED UNDER CONTROL 
WE'LL BRING IN 
PROPER FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PARK IS THE 
BIGGEST REGENERATION PROJECT IN 
WESTERN EUROPE THE AGENCY HAS 
INVESTED IN BUYING THE LAND SO THE 
MAYOR WILL BE KEEN TO SEE RETURN 
ON THAT INVESTMENT ONE AREA WHERE 
I IS THOUGHT HE MAY WANT TO 
INFLUENCE THE LEGACY ON THE 
PROPORTION OF AFFORDABLE HOMES TO 
BE LEFT ON THE SITE 
THE VISION WE 
SOLD WHEN WEED BY FOR THE GAMES WAS 
NOT JUST BRINGING THE GAMES HERE 
BUT GENERATE THE AREA SO HE CAN'T 
WALK AWAY FROM THAT EAST LONDS 
NEED TO BE STRONGER AS A RESULT OF 
THIS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IT'S A 
STRENGTH BUILT AS MUCH IN THE LOCAL 
COMMUNITY AS THE NEEDS ON EXTERNAL 
INTERESTS INTERESTS KEN LIVINGSTONE MADE NO SECRET OF 
THE FACT FOR HIM THE OLYMPICS WAS 
ABOUT J. E. GENERATION BUT IF FROM THE 
NEW MAYOR IS THERE IS A DIFFERENT 
MESSAGE THERE IS MORE EMPHASIS ON 
SPORTING PARTICIPATION 
KATE HOEY 
THE M. P. IS GOING TO BE THE MAYOR'S 
COMMISSIONER FOR SPORT AN AN APPOINTMENT OF A LABOUR M. P. IS SEEN 
AS A CLEAR INDICATION OF HIS 
DETERMINATION TO DELIVER ON THE 
SPORTING LEGACY BODIES 
REPRESENTING GRASS ROOTS SPORTS 
HAVE WELCOMED HIS ENTHUSIASM ONE ONE OF THE THINGS WE WERE PROMISED WAS 
THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD BE INSPIRED 
TO GET INTO SPORT AND RECREATION ON 
THE BACK OF THE OLYMPICS AND IF 
BORIS CAN DO THAT FOR LONDON THEN 
THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND HOPEFULLY 
THAT CAN BE REPLICATED THROUGHOUT 
THE COUNTRY 
THE NEW MAYOR HAS 
PROMISED HE WON'T BE PULLING ANY 
PUNCHS ROUND THE BOARD TABLE BUT 
WHAT DOES HE THINK ABOUT THE 
PROSPECT OF WORKING WITH LABOUR'S 
OLYMPICS MINISTER WHO WHO WAS KEN 
LIVINGSTONE'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER I I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE VERY 
HARMONIOUS AND CIVILISED BUT I HAVE 
BEEN ELECTED ON A MAN TODAY BY 
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE OLYMPIC TORCH ALREADY 
MAKING ITS WAY ROUND BRITAIN AND IF 
THINGS ARE GOING WELL THERE COULD 
BE A FOOL GOOD FACTOR SO IF BORIS 
JONSSON GETS HIS ROLE RIGHT IT 
COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMFACT 
IMPACT ON HIS POSSIBLY RE ELECTION 
BORIS JOHNSON'S NEWLY APPOINTED 
MINISTER FOR SPORT IS WITH US HERE 
YOU LEFT YOUR TENNIS RACKET AT HOME 
BEFORE WE GET ON THE THE OLYMPIC 
MATTER SIR IAN BLAIR YOU THINK HE 
SHOULD HAVE A SECOND TERM 
I HAVE 
ONLY READ WHAT I HAVE SEEN IN THE 
PAPER AND LEN DUVALL HAD THAT 
DISCUSSION BEFORE THE ELECTION L. 
THINK WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE 
IT IS NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY A A LONDON LABOUR M. P. WOULD YOU SAY 
PROBABLY 
BECAUSE I HAD STOCKWELL PROBABLY IN MY CONSTITUENCY AND THERE WAS A 
LOT OF CONCERN WHAT HAPPENED THEN 
WE HAVE MOVED ON AND I FEEL HE HAS 
ANOTHER TWO YEAR FOS GO ANY WAY AND 
I IMAGINE THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE 
TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO 
HAPPEN AFTER THAT 
WHAT DO YOU 
THINK 
I AM SURE THERE WILL BE THINK SOMEBODY NEW IN TWEN 
HIS DAYS 
ARE NUMBERED YOU ARE SAYING THAT 
I AM NOT SOME WOULD SAY IT IS 
CURIOUS OTHERS SAY ASTONISHING YOU 
HAVE THIS POST IN RELATION TO THE 
LONDON OLYMPICS BAZ YOU WERE NEVER 
A FAN OF THE LONDONED BY YOU 
DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE GOING TO WIN 
I THINK PARIS HAS A WONDERFUL 
SPORTING STPRUBG BG 
INFRASTRUCTURE I FELT WE HADN'T 
DONE MUCH ON SPORT ONCE WE GOT THE 
OLYMPIC MY JOB AND WHAT I THINK 
LONDONERS WANT TO SEE IS US 
DELIVERING ON 
IT IS KIND OF FAIR 
WEATHER DO YOU REMEMBER IT WAS A 
SENSITIVE TIME FOR LONDON TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
TRYING TO GET PUBLIC SUPPORT THEN 
WE HAVE A FORMER SPORTS MINISTER 
SAYING I DON'T THINK LONDON SHOULD 
GET IT 
THE PUBLIC IF THEY READ THE 
ARTICLE ONE WROTE AND SAW WHAT I 
WROTE IN CONTEXT IT WAS ABOUT THE 
FACT THAT IF WE WERE GOING TO 
DELIVER AN OLYMPICS IN LONDON IT 
HAS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO EVERY 
SINGLE LONDONER NOT JUST ABOUT 
REGENERATION WHICH IS IMPORTANT 
NOT JUST ABOUT DELIVER AGO 
BRILLIANT GAMES WHICH WE WILL DO 
BECAUSE WE DO THINGS LIKE THAT VERY 
WELL 
IT MAKES IT IS A LAME DUCK WELL START AND THERE ARE A LOFT PEOPLE 
WHO FEEL HOSTILE TOWARDS YOU 
BECAUSE OF IT 
I THINK THE PEOPLE I 
AM INTERESTED IN ARE MAINLY THE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THERE IN THE 
COMMUNITY DELIVERING SPORT NAY ARE 
THE PEOPLE THAT MATTER THEY ARE 
THE PEOPLE THE GRASS ROOTS SPORTS 
PEOPLE THAT I WANT TO GET ON SIDE 
I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RUNNING 
THE OLYMPICS ARE DOING PROBABLY A 
VERY VERY GOOD JOB NOW WE HAVE TO 
DELIVER AND EXCELLENT GAMES AND THE 
GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO MAKE SURE 
THAT HAPPENS WHATEVER IT COSTS L. 
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT VERY SOON WE 
GET TO MAKE SURE ANY HOLES THAT ARE 
THERE ANY OTHER BAD NEWS THAT WILL 
COME OUT I THINK NEEDS TO COME OUT 
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
YOU SAW THE 
REPORTS ABOUT WE KNEW ABOUT THE 
COST OR CERTAIN PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT 
THE COST OF THE AQUATIC CENTRE 
THAT IT WAS HIGHER THAN AND AND THERE WILL BE MORE THINGS TO COME 
OUT WHAT KIND OF AREAS L. DON'T 
KNOW BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS 
THAT LONDONERS WHO ARE ULTIMATELY 
GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS GREAT 
SPECTACLE KNOW THE TRUTH WE ARE AS 
TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE AND NO ONE 
IN LONDON IS SAYING STOP THE GAMES 
SO REALITY IS GAMES WILL BE RE 
DELIVER THEY WILL BE DELIVERED 
WELL THEY WILL COST A LOFT MONEY 
HAVE YOU HAD BORIS JOHNSON SAYING 
HE IS LESS INTERESTED IN 
REGENERATION 
WHAT I AM GOING TO DO REGENERATION IS WE HAVEN'T GOT A LEGACY PLAN FOR 
LONDON YET FOR SPORT IN TERMS OF 
PARTICIPATION IN TERMS OF THE 
THINGS IF YOU GO INTO ANY PART OF 
LONDON YOU WILL FIND CREAKING 
FACILITIES ON HOUSING ESTATES 
PEOPLE ARE PLACES THAT PEOPLE ARE 
NOT ABLE TO PLAY ON PROPERLY WE ARE 
SEEING GREEN FIELDS BEING 
THREATENED 
THIS IS TEN YEARS BOOM THREATENED TOWN SOMEHOW THAT GOING TO CHANGE 
NOW WITH THE PUBLIC SPENDING 
SITUATION 
AT THE MOMENT THERE IS SITUATION LOTS OF GOOD THINGS HAPPENING IN 
DIFFERENT BITS OF LONDON WE ARE 
NOT FOLLOWING BEST PRACTICE WE ARE 
NOT CO ORDINATING SOME OF THE 
LOCAL AUTHORITYS ARE DOING A GOOD 
JOB WE ARE NOT GETTING THAT CO 
ORDINATION SO THAT EVERYONE IS 
SINGING FROM THE SAME HIM SHEET IN 
O. HYMN SHEET THERE IS A LOT OF 
MONEY 
IN WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES 
IF YOU MONEY LISTEN 
I AM TAKING YOU ON L. AM LISTEN LISTENING WHAT IS YOUR TEST FROM 
BORIS JOHNSON WHEN ARE YOU GOING 
TO BE PREPARED TO TELL IF HIM IF HE 
DOESN'T GET THINGS RIGHT 
MY TEST 
IS WHETHER WE HAVE DELIVERED ON 
WHAT WE WANT DO IS WHETHER THIS 
FOUR YEARS TIME APART FROM DELIVER 
AGO WONDERFUL OLYMPIC GAMES APART 
FROM THE LEGACY THAT THAT LEAVES IN 
EAST LONDON IF EVERY LONDONER OUT 
THERE IN OUTER LONDON BOROUGHS IN 
INNER CITY AREAS LIKE MINE WILL BE 
ABLE TO SAY THEY HAVE SEEN 
SOMETHING THAT HAS MADE A 
DIFFERENCE TO THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE 
AND THEIR OLDER PEOPLE'S 
OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN 
SPORT WHY ARE WE CLOSING SWIMMING 
POOLS IN LONDON WE SHOULD NOT BE 
ALLOWING THAT TO HAPPEN WHY ARE WE 
ALLOWING PLAYING FIELDS TO BE SOLD 
OFF I WANT TO CAPTURE THE 
IMAGINATION AND THE REAL SUPPORT 
FOR SPORT THAT THE OLYMPICS CAN 
BRING AND I THINK WHAT WE JUST 
SEEN IS A BIT OF SHIFT IN THE 
EMPHASIS NOT ANY NOT ANYTHING 
RENEGING ON ANYTHING THAT WILL 
HAPPEN ON THE OLYMPICS 
A POLITICAL 
TRAITOR HOW BADLY IS THAT GOING TO 
DAMAGE YOU SEEING YOU ARE LABOUR 
SPORT IS ONE THING WHERE PEOPLE 
WANT THE SEE PEOPLE WORKING 
TOGETHER I HAVE HAD PEOPLE SAYING 
POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT GO GETTING 
ON WITH EACH OTHER AND TALKING AND 
THEY LOOK ON THE PUBLIC OUTSIDE AS 
IF THEY ARE FIGHTING EACH OTHER AND 
I THINK THE PUBLIC WILL RECOGNISE 
THAT THIS WAS AN IMAGINATIVE WAY OF 
LOOKING AT HOW WE RUN SPORT IN 
LONDON AND WHILE THERE WILL BE SOME 
PEOPLE WHO FEEL AS A LABOUR M. P. I 
SHOULDN'T BE WORKING IN A TORY 
ADMINISTRATION I AM RINGFENCED 
DEALING ON SPORT AND THINK THE 
PUBLIC WILL LIKE IT THANK YOU 
NOW OLD AGE AIN'T NO PLACE FOR 
SISSYS AS BETTE DAVIS ONCE SAID 
EVERYTHING GETS HARDER AS TIME 
CATCHES US WITH US AND OUR LAST FEW 
YEARS ARE OFTEN THE HARDEST ARE WE 
GUILTY AS A NATION OF 
DISCRIMINATING AGAINST OLDER 
PEOPLE IN A MOMENT I WILL SPEAK TO 
BARONESS JULIA NEUBERGER WHO HAS 
JUST WRITTEN A NEW BOOK CALLED NOT 
DEAD YET INSPIRED BY SOME OF THE 
TREATMENT HER ELDERLY RELATIVES 
RECEIVED AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE 
THIS WAS THE RESPONSE IN NEWCASTLE 
I THINK A LOT OF ELDERLY FOLK FI 
THIS THEY ARE ENTITLED TO MORE THAN 
THEY ARE L. THINK IN THIS DAY AND 
AGE AND SPECIALLY WHERE I LIVE 
ELDERLY PEOPLE ARE WELL CARED FOR 
L. MEAN 
I COULD STAND HERE WITH 
NOTHING OWN AND NOBODY WOULD PAY 
ANY ATTENTION TO US WHICH IS VERY 
SAD 
I CAN ONLY SPEAK OF MICE I AM SAD MANAGING ALL RIGHT AND MYSELF 
ALLOUPSS ARE MADE FOR US L. DO AND AND BARONESS JULIA NEUBERGER IS WITH ME 
NOW THANK YOU AND WELCOME TO THE 
POLITICS SHOW NO ONE DOUBTS THAT 
OLD AGE IS DIFFICULT BUT DOES IT 
AMOUNT TO DISCRIMINATION 
I THINK 
IT DEPEND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WE 
HEARD PEOPLE SAYING IT IS NOT TOO 
BAD BUT THEY ARE ACTIVE LIVELY AND 
OUT THERE L. THINK IT IS THE PEOPLE 
WHO ARE REALLY FRAIL AND WHO ARE 
IN THE HANDS OF OUR HEALTH SERVICE 
OR CARE HOMES OR IN OUR NURSING 
HOMES AND I THINK MANY OF THEM DO 
SUFFER SOME REAL DISCRIMINATION AND 
THERE IS REAL DISCRIMINATION IN THE 
AMOUNT OF CHOICE THEY ARE GIVEN 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM 
THIS IS 
WE ASKED PEOPLE FOR THEIR VIEWS AND 
ONE VIEWER WHO IS SEVENTY JOHN DICKINSON 
HE SAID IN GENERAL THE IDEA THE 
ELDERLY ARE DISCRIMINAL NAITH 
NAITED AGAINST IS NONSENSE 
POLITICIAN HAVE BOFRPBT BACKWARD TO 
KEEP THE GREY LOBBY ONBOARD HERE 
HAVE A FEW FREE BUS PASSES 
HEATING ALLOWANCE ISN'T THAT AN 
IMPORTANT POINT SHOULDN'T HELP BE 
GIVEN ON THE BASIS OF NEED 
I THINK 
HELP SHOULD BE GIVEN MUCH MORE ON 
THE BASIS OF NEED BUT THE REAL 
THING I FEEL IS THERE IS LOTS OF 
THINGS LIKE FREE BUS PASSES THAT 
EVERYBODY LOVES BUT PROBABLY A LOT 
OF PEOPLE DON'T NEED BUT THERE IS A 
LOFT THINGS THAT GO ON THAT 
SHOULDN'T HAPPEN FOR INSTANCE WHY 
SHOULD PEOPLE HAVE TO RETIRE AT SIXTY FIVE 
WHY DID THE GOVERNMENT IN A SENSE 
GIVE IN TO THE C. B. I. AND SAY IT IS O. K. 
TO FORCE PEOPLE OUT AT OF FIVE SURELY 
YOU SHOULD BE JUDGE ON WHETHER YOU 
CAN DO THE JOB WHAT ABOUT 
TELEVISION PRESENTERS OF YOU ARE 
ONLY ALLOWED TO BE A VOICE ON RADIO 
WHEN YOU ARE OLDER WHAT IS THAT 
ABOUT 
I I WON'T GO INTO THAT ONE 
SPECIAL PLEADING THERE WE WILL 
LEAVE THAT TO ONE SIDE FOR THE 
MOMENT BUT YOU CAN CALLING FOR A 
GREY PANTHER MOVEMENT IN THIS BOOK 
I AM L. THINK OLDER PEOPLE AND THE 
REALLY FRAIL OLDER PEOPLE DON'T DON'T AGE CONCERN DO THAT 
NO L. THINK 
AGE CONCERN AND HELP THE AGED AND 
THE CHER OTHER CHARITIES DO VERY 
GOOD WORK BUT I DON'T THINK THEY 
HAVE BEEN ANGRY ENOUGH THEY GET 
LOTS OF GRANTS TO RUN SERVICES SO 
ON SOME THINGS THEY HAVEN'T GOT 
ANGRY ENOUGH RETIREMENT AGE 
QUESTIONS OF DIGNITY THE LACK OF 
DIGNITY ON HOSPITAL WARDS IS A 
CRYING SHAPE YOU TALK THE LOTS OF 
OLDER PEOPLE ABOUT HAVING TO USE A 
COMMODE WITH A THIN CURTAIN AND 
EVERYBODY CAN HEAR AND SMELL WHAT 
YOU ARE DOING CAN YOU IMAGINE 
THAT IS DISGRACEFUL I THINK THE THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING ABOUT HAVING 
A CELEBRITY DIGNITY AMBASSADOR THEY 
ARE GOING TO UNVEIL THIS WEEK DOES 
THAT HELP 
IT HELPS IF THAT DIGNITY 
AMBASSADOR HAS ANY POWER THEY HAD 
DIGNITY NURSES AND THAT WAS DROPPED 
BECAUSE ONE NURSE CAN'T DO IT ALL 
IF THERE IS A DIGNITY AMBASSADOR 
WHO CAN GET IN THERE AND WHO CAN 
SAY UP WITH THIS WE WILL NOT PUT 
THIS IS DISGRACEFUL THIS WARD HAS 
TO CLOSE YES I THINK THAT COULD 
HELP 
YOU HAVE BASED THIS BOOK ON HELP PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AND VERY 
MOVING PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OF YOUR 
OWN RELATIVES IS THAT THE WAY A 
GOOD WAY TO GENERATE PUBLIC POLICY 
DOESN'T PUBLIC POLICY HAVE TO BE 
MORE COOL RAGGAL 
I DIDN'T BASE 
THIS BOOK ON MY OWN PERSONAL 
EXPERIENCE RATIONAL 
THEY ILL 
THEY ILLUSTRATE WHAT IS WIDER 
PROFPBLGT I I HAVE LOOKED TAT DATA 
THE SORT OF 
ARE THE LEVEL OF 
MALNUTRITION OF PEOPLE WHO GO INTO 
HOSPITAL AND HOW MUCH HIGHER WHEN 
THEY COME OUT THAT IS NOT MY 
FAMILY'S PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT 
IS HARD FABG L. HAVE LOOKED AT 
ISSUES ABOUT THERE IS NO 
AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC LOOS YOU 
ARE WORRIED ABOUT BEING CAUGHT 
SHORT SO YOU DON'T GO OUT L. THINK 
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE DATA AND USED 
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE TO ILLUSTRATE 
IT AND I WANT TO MAKE IT MORE REAL 
TO PEOPLE 
O. K. THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
INDEED AND THAT IS IT FOR THIS 
WEEK THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US 
WE ARE NOT HERE NEXT SUNDAY BECAUSE 
OF THE HOLIDAY DO JOIN ME FOR THAT 
BY ELECTION SPECIAL ON THURSDAY 
NIGHT IF YOU CAN UNTIL THEN
