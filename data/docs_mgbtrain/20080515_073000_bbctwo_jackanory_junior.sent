THIS IS JACKANORY JUNIOR 
HI I'M TAMSIN 
DO YOUR PARENTS EVER DO SILLY THINGS 
THINGS THAT MAKE YOU SO EMBARRASSED 
YOU JUST WANT TO JUMP BACK INTO BED AND HIDE YOUR HEAD UNDER THE COVERS 
WELL THIS IS THE STORY OF A BOY 
WHO HAD THE MOST EMBARRASSING PARENTS IN THE WHOLE WORLD 
IT'S CALLED EXPLORER TRAUMA 
INDIANA BROWN WAS BORN IN A TENT 
DEEP IN A TROPICAL RAINFOREST 
A YEAR LATER HE TOOK HIS FIRST STEPS AT THE TOP OF MOUNT EVEREST 
WHEN HE WAS TWO INDIANA LEARNED TO SWING WITH MONKEYS ON JUNGLE VINES 
BY THE TIME HE WAS THREE 
HE WAS SWIMMING WITH DOLPHINS IN THE INDIAN OCEAN 
BUT WHEN HE WAS FOUR HIS NAN PUT HER FOOT DOWN 
THUMP 
LITTLE INDIANA NEEDS TO GO TO SCHOOL SHE TOLD HIS MUM AND DAD 
IT'S TIME YOU STOPPED DRAGGING HIM AROUND THE WORLD 
YOU DIDN'T ARGUE WITH INDIANA'S NAN 
SHE WAS FIERCER THAN ANY TIGER 
SHE COULD GLARE LIKE A COBRA 
SHE COULD SNAP LIKE A CROCODILE 
BUT SHE WAS ALWAYS A PUSSYCAT TO INDIANA 
SO FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS 
INDIANA AND HIS PARENTS HAD BEEN LIVING NEXT DOOR TO NAN 
THEY TRIED TO LIVE A NORMAL LIFE BUT IT WASN'T EASY 
THEY WEREN'T EXACTLY NORMAL PEOPLE 
MR. AND MRS. BROWN WERE EXPLORERS WHO HAD TRAVELLED THE WORLD 
ALL THE OTHER CHILDREN AT SCHOOL 
THOUGHT THAT INDIANA WAS THE LUCKIEST BOY ALIVE 
HE'D HAD MORE ADVENTURES THAN THEY COULD EVER DREAM OF 
BUT HAVING EXPLORER PARENTS WASN'T ALWAYS SO GREAT 
TAKE BREAKFAST 
MR. AND MRS. BROWN DIDN'T EAT TOAST OR CEREAL IN THE MORNING 
OH NO THEY LIKED TO CATCH THEIR FOOD THEMSELVES 
THE WAY THEY DID IN THE RAINFOREST 
THEY CALLED IT BUSH TUCKER 
INDIANA CALLED IT EARTHWORMS OR BEETLES 
FOOD WASN'T THE ONLY PROBLEM 
MR. AND MRS. BROWN ALWAYS WANTED TO GO TO EXCITING PLACES 
IN THE SCHOOL HOLIDAYS 
CHRISTMAS IN PERU INDIANA'S BEST FRIEND JOE WOULD SIGH 
COOL 
IT WON'T BE COOL INDIANA WOULD MOAN IT'LL BE BOILING 
INDIANA DIDN'T REALLY LIKE HOT WEATHER 
HE GOT SUNBURN AND PRICKLY HEAT AND SWEATY KNEES 
HE DIDN'T LIKE SNAKES OR SPIDERS OR COCKROACHES EITHER 
HE COULDN'T STAND CAMPING AND LOATHED FLYING ON AEROPLANES 
BUT THE THING HE HATED MOST OF ALL WAS THAT HE MISSED HIS NAN 
I WISH WE COULD GO TO THE SEASIDE WITH YOU HE SAID EVERY SUMMER 
IT WAS ALMOST THE END OF TERM 
AND INDIANA'S SCHOOL WERE HAVING A SUMMER FAIR 
MR. AND MRS. BROWN COULD HARDLY WAIT TO TRY EVERYTHING 
MRS. BROWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GO AT THE APPLE BOBBING GAME FIRST 
AFTER CATCHING SEA SLUGS WITH MY TEETH FOR LUNCH 
THIS'LL BE A DODDLE SHE SAID 
THEN SHE UNZIPPED HER RUCKSACK 
WHIPPED OUT A SNORKEL AND MASK 
AND SLAPPED THEM ON TO HER FACE 
SHE'S CHEATING CRIED A LITTLE GIRL LOUDLY 
THAT LADY IS CHEATING 
I SAY MRS. BROWN STOP THAT AT ONCE SAID MRS. CHINFLUFF 
THE TEACHER IN CHARGE 
C. H. C. H. CHEATING SPLUTTERED HIS MUM 
IT'S NOT CHEATING IT'S SURVIVAL 
SHE WHO DARES WINS IT'S A JUNGLE OUT THERE SON 
INDIANA HUSTLED HIS PARENTS AWAY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
NEXT THEY CAME TO THE CAKE STALL 
MR. BROWN'S EYES LIT UP 
INDIE YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS MR. BROWN SAID 
I COULD HAVE KNOCKED UP SOME OF MY MUFFINS 
DAD I DON'T THINK INDIANA BEGAN 
BUT HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE TEACHER RUNNING THE STALL 
TRY THESE BUTTERFLY CAKES THEY'RE DELICIOUS 
MR. BROWN PEERED AT THEM 
AH SHAME I THOUGHT YOU MEANT REAL BUTTERFLIES HE SAID 
THE TEACHER GAVE HIM A STRANGE LOOK BUT MR. BROWN DIDN'T NOTICE 
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED A BUSH TUCKER BISCUIT 
A BUSH TUCKER BISCUIT HE SAID IS SO GOOD 
IT POSITIVELY WRIGGLES IN THE MOUTH 
ANYTHING FROM THE GARDEN WILL DO 
A WORM BEETLE OR SNAIL FOR MORE OF A MELT IN THE MOUTH TEXTURE 
THE TEACHER'S RED CHEEKS TURNED WHITE 
AND THEN A VILE SHADE OF GREEN 
SHE RAN OFF ONE HAND CLAPPED TO HER MOUTH 
AT THE END OF THE DAY THE HEADTEACHER MRS. BULLNECK 
GATHERED EVERYONE TO CALL OUT THE PRIZE NUMBERS FOR THE RAFFLE 
THE WINNER OF THIS BEAUTIFUL CHINA DOLL 
IS NUMBER SEVENTY THREE SHE ANNOUNCED 
BUT INDIANA HAD STOPPED LISTENING 
OUT OF THE CORNER OF ONE EYE 
HE COULD SEE HIS MUM BOUNCING ON THE BOUNCY CASTLE 
OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS OTHER EYE HE COULD SEE HIS DAD 
JUGGLING COCONUTS AT THE COCONUT SHY 
JOE ELBOWED HIM SUDDENLY 
INDIE YOU'RE NUMBER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT AREN'T YOU 
INDIANA BLINKED WHAT HAD HE WON 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OUR STAR PRIZE HAS GONE TO INDIANA BROWN 
EVERYONE CLAPPED INDIANA FELT FAINT 
STAR PRIZE WHAT WAS SHE TALKING ABOUT 
MRS. BULLNECK PASSED HIM A GOLD ENVELOPE 
ON THE ENVELOPE WAS WRITTEN HAPPY HOLIDAYS

INDIANA FOUND HIS MUM AND DAD

INDIANA WAVED THE ENVELOPE IN THE AIR

INDIANA OPENED THE GOLDEN ENVELOPE 
IT'S A TRIP TO 
WHERE DAD ASKED 
SOUTH AMERICA 
INDIA MUM SAID CROSSING HER FINGERS 
IT'S BETTER THAN THAT BEAMED INDIANA 
A WEEK AT THE BOGGY BEACH HOLIDAY CAMP 
DAD FROWNED

MUM LOOKED THOUGHTFUL 
WE'LL HAVE TO GET SOME NEW JABS DONE 
INDIANA LAUGHED 
IT'S NOT ABROAD HE TOLD THEM 
WE DON'T HAVE TO FLY THERE 
WE DON'T NEED PASSPORTS OR VACCINATIONS 
IT'S IN THIS COUNTRY A SEASIDE HOLIDAY 
MR. AND MRS. BROWN WEREN'T QUITE SO EXCITED 
IT SOUNDED RATHER SAFE FOR THEIR LIKING 
NO MOUNTAINS OR RAINFOREST 
NO SHARKS 
OR POISONOUS SNAKES 
STILL THEY WERE SURE THEY'D FIND SOMETHING DANGEROUS TO DO THERE 
AFTER A FEW DAYS AT BOGGY BEACH 
INDIANA FELT HAPPIER THAN HE HAD DONE IN AGES 
HE'D PLAYED FOOTBALL WITH HIS NEW MATES 
HE'D SWUM THIRTY LENGTHS OF THE POOL WITHOUT STOPPING 
AND HE HAD SAUSAGES AND CHIPS EVERY SINGLE NIGHT 
IT WAS THE BEST HOLIDAY OF HIS LIFE 
TO EVERYONE'S SURPRISE MR. AND MRS. BROWN WERE HAVING FUN TOO 
MR. BROWN HAD ENTERED THE KNOBBLY KNEES CONTEST 
AND WON THIRD PRIZE 
HE SAID IT WAS HIS FINEST MOMENT 
SINCE HE DISCOVERED A SMALL ISLAND OFF THE COAST OF BRAZIL 
MRS. BROWN HAD WARBLED HER WAY THROUGH SEVEN SONGS 
AT THE KARAOKE CONTEST 
SHE DIDN'T WIN A PRIZE BUT SHE SAID IT WAS THE BRAVEST THING SHE'D DONE 
SINCE TACKLING A TIGER IN THAILAND 
ISN'T IT LUCKY YOU WON THAT PRIZE IN THE RAFFLE 
MUM AND DAD SAID AS THEY WALKED BACK TO THEIR CHALET 
TO GET CHANGED FOR THE BANANA BOUNCING CONTEST 
WE NEVER KNEW YOU COULD HAVE SO MUCH FUN 
RIGHT HERE IN THIS COUNTRY 
SO YOU MEAN INDIANA TOOK A DEEP BREATH 
MAYBE EVEN WITH NAN 
MR. AND MRS. BROWN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER 
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT 
INDIANA FELT AS IF HIS WHOLE FACE WAS ONE HUGE SMILE 
HE SMILED AT HIS MUM 
HE SMILED AT HIS DAD 
AND AS HE LOOKED AT THEM HE REALISED SOMETHING 
JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHER MUMS AND DADS 
IT WAS GREAT 
LATER THAT DAY AFTER COMING THIRD IN THE LILO RACING TOURNAMENT 
INDIANA WENT TO LOOK FOR MUM AND DAD 
THERE IN FRONT OF HIM WAS 
OH NO 
MR. BROWN WAS WEARING A GRASS SKIRT WITH A PAIR OF BONGO DRUMS 
AROUND HIS NECK 
MRS. BROWN HAD ON A WET SUIT WITH A SNORKEL 
MASK AND FLIPPERS 
MUM DAD WHAT ARE YOU DOING INDIANA HISSED 
LOOKING AROUND IN CASE ANY OF HIS NEW FRIENDS WERE NEARBY 
HIS MUM BEAMED AT HIM 
WE'RE GIVING A TALK ON OUR ADVENTURES SHE SAID 
YOUR DAD'S GOING TO DO THE TRIBAL DANCE OF HOOLA BOOLA 
INDIANA LOOKED AT HIS DAD IN HORROR 
YOUR MUM'S GOING TO TELL EVERYONE HOW SHE WRESTLED 
WITH THAT SHARK IN THE SOUTH SEAS 
MR. BROWN SAID PROUDLY 
AND WE'VE GOT THAT VIDEO OF YOU GROWING UP IN THE JUNGLE 
WHAT THAT VIDEO WHERE I'VE GOT NO CLOTHES ON INDIANA GROANED 
HE FELT SICK 
JUST AS HE'D THOUGHT THEY HAD CHANGED FOR THE BETTER 
THEY HAD BECOME WORSE THAN EVER 
HA YOU SILLY BANANA ROARED MR. BROWN 
MRS. BROWN RUFFLED INDIANA'S HAIR 
OF COURSE WE'RE NOT PUTTING ON A TALK SHE GIGGLED 
WE'RE GOING IN FOR THE FANCY DRESS COMPETITION THAT'S ALL 
THANK GOODNESS INDIANA SAID WEAKLY 
MR. BROWN SLAPPED HIM ON THE BACK 
WE'RE SAVING THE DANCING DEMONSTRATION 
FOR YOUR PARENTS' EVENING AT SCHOOL HE SAID CHEERFULLY 
THEN HE ROARED WITH LAUGHTER AGAIN AS INDIANA'S FACE TURNED WHITE 
HA HA JOKE HE YELLED 
SUDDENLY INDIANA FOUND THAT HE WAS LAUGHING TOO 
THEY WERE NEVER GOING TO CHANGE MUCH WERE THEY 
NORMAL FAT CHANCE 
THEY WERE COMPLETELY BONKERS 
BUT HE STILL LOVED THEM 
INDIANA'S MUM PUT HER ARM AROUND HIM 
SORRY LOVE WE COULDN'T RESIST IT

INDIANA HUGGED HER BACK
