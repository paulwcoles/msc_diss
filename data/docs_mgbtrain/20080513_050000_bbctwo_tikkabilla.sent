THAT WAS A LOVELY STORY BEVERLEY CAN I BORROW THAT BOOK 
ER YEAH WHAT FOR IT'S GIVEN ME AN IDEA TO BUILD SOMETHING O. K. 
I WONDER WHAT IT IS PAUL'S GOING TO BUILD 
I'M GOING TO BUILD A TRAIN A BIT LIKE THE ONE IN THE STORY TODAY 
I WENT TO THE SUPERMARKET AND I FOUND ALL THESE EMPTY BOXES 
AND PAINTED THEM RED AND THEY LOOK PERFECT FOR MY TRAIN NOW 
SO ER 
NOT USE THIS ONE RIGHT NOW 
IT'S QUITE SMALL THIS BOX 
I THINK I'LL START BUILDING THE ENGINE OF THE TRAIN FIRST 
NEED A BOX A BIG BOX TO START OFF WITH LIKE THIS 
THEN WHAT KIND OF BOX SHOULD I USE FOR THE FUNNEL 
I DON'T THINK ANY OF THESE 
MAYBE THIS BOX WOULD BE 
PERFECT LOOK AT THAT GREAT 
AND THIS BOX IS FINE FOR A SMALL PART OF THE ENGINE 
AT THE FRONT OF THE TRAIN THERE WE ARE 
WELL ACTUALLY IT DOESN'T LOOK QUITE LIKE A TRAIN YET 
THIS BOX HERE 
AND THEN 
THIS BOX HERE 
NO HERE 
AND THIS BOX 
HERE LIKE THIS 
HA HA NOW THIS IS BEGINNING 
TO LOOK MORE LIKE A TRAIN 
M. M. M. BUT FOR THE TRAIN TO MOVE ALONG THE TRACKS 
IT NEEDS SOME WHEELS 
I THINK I'VE GOT SOME OTHER THINGS IN THE SMALL BOX HERE LET'S SEE 
SOME PAPER PLATES AND THESE HAVE ALL BEEN PAINTED BLACK 
THEY'LL BE GREAT WHEELS 
LOTS OF WHEELS 
GREAT 
PERFECT 
JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT 
NOW I'VE GOT SOME OTHER THINGS IN THIS BOX 
SOMETHING WHICH I THINK IS PERFECT TO MAKE THE STEAM AND THE SMOKE 
FOR THE FUNNEL 
SOME TISSUE PAPER 
GOT SOME GREY TISSUE PAPER AND SOME WHITE TISSUE PAPER 
CHOO CHOO 
HA HA THAT'S JUST GREAT 
AND THIS IS MY TRAIN 
A BIT LIKE THE TRAIN IN THE STORY 
AND I THINK IT'S TIME TO READ THIS STORY AGAIN

OVER THE MEADOW UP ON THE HILL

A MARE AND HER FOAL STANDING PERFECTLY STILL

WELCOMING ME 
A HA 
THERE ARE SOME ANIMALS ON THE MOVE THROUGH THE WINDOWS TODAY 
SOME MOVE QUICKLY AND SOME MOVE MORE SLOWLY 
HOW MANY WINDOWS 
ONE TWO THREE 
ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED 
WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
IT'S THE ARCHED WINDOW 
THIS BIRD IS CALLED A FALCON 
WHEN A FALCON DIVES THROUGH THE SKY LIKE THIS 
IT IS ONE OF THE FASTEST BIRDS OF ALL 
THESE BIRDS ARE PRETTY FAST DIVERS AS WELL 
THESE ARE CALLED GANNETS 
THEY LIKE TO EAT FISH 
BUT TO CATCH THEM THEY HAVE TO DIVE DOWN FROM THE SKY REALLY QUICKLY 
WHEN THEY HIT THE WATER THEY'RE GOING SO FAST 
THEY CAN DIVE DOWNWARDS TO CATCH THE FISH BEFORE THEY SWIM AWAY 
THESE BIRDS ARE SWANS 
AND THEY ARE MUCH BIGGER THAN FALCONS OR GANNETS 
BECAUSE THEY ARE BIG THEY FIND IT HARD TO GET INTO THE AIR AND FLY 
LOOK AT THESE SWANS TAKING OFF 
THEY HAVE TO RUN ON THE WATER AND FLAP THEIR BIG WINGS TO TAKE OFF 
THIS BASILISK LIZARD RUNS ON WATER A BIT LIKE THE SWAN 
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WINGS 
SO IT HAS TO RUN REALLY FAST TO STOP IT FROM SINKING 
THIS LIZARD RUNS SO FAST IT CAN RUN ACROSS THE WATER'S SURFACE 
HERE IS ANOTHER ANIMAL THAT CAN RUN VERY FAST 
THIS IS A DARKLING BEETLE 
IT LIVES IN THE HOT DESERT SO IT HAS TO RUN AS FAST AS IT CAN 
SO THAT IT DOESN'T GET TOO HOT ON THE DESERT SAND 
WHAT A SUPER SPEEDY BEETLE 
THIS CHAMELEON LIKES TO EAT BEETLES AND OTHER BUGS 
BUT IT IS SO SLOW IT COULD NEVER RUN AFTER ONE AND CATCH IT 
THE ONLY WAY A CHAMELEON CAN CATCH ITS LUNCH 
IS TO MOVE REALLY SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY 
TO SNEAK UP ON THEM 
THIS BIG CAT IS CALLED A CHEETAH 
AND IT IS THE FASTEST ANIMAL OF ALL 
IT HAS TO RUN VERY FAST TO CATCH UP WITH ANIMALS IT LIKES TO EAT 
CHEETAHS ARE SUCH FAST RUNNERS THEY ALMOST LOOK LIKE THEY'RE FLYING 
WHEN THEY RUN AT FULL SPEED 
THIS ANIMAL IS ONE OF THE SLOWEST ANIMALS OF ALL 
A GIANT TORTOISE DOESN'T HAVE TO MOVE FAST IT ONLY EATS PLANTS 
THEY CAN'T RUN AWAY 
IT HAS A BIG HEAVY SHELL WHICH SLOWS IT DOWN 
BUT THIS ANIMAL IS EVEN SLOWER THAN A TORTOISE 
IT'S A SNAIL 
SNAILS HAVE NO ARMS AND LEGS SO THEY SLIDE ALONG AT A SNAIL'S PACE 
ON A LAYER OF SLIME 
SNAILS JUST EAT PLANTS AS WELL 
SO THEY CAN JUST SIT ON A JUICY LEAF AND MUNCH AS SLOWLY AS THEY LIKE 
SOME ANIMALS MOVE FAST AND SOME ANIMALS MOVE SLOWLY 
I CAN RUN REALLY FAST 
THAT'S VERY GOOD TAMBA BUT CAN YOU MOVE VERY SLOWLY 
YES I CAN 
OH THAT'S VERY GOOD SLOW MOVING 
VERY GOOD ANIMALS MOVE IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS YES 
THOSE SWANS WERE FLYING 
TAMBA WHAT'S THE MATTER 
I WISH I COULD FLY LIKE A BIRD 
I WISH THAT I COULD FLY LIKE A BIRD 
WITH A SONG AS SWEET AS YOU'VE EVER HEARD 
I'D SWOOP AND GLIDE SO GRACEFULLY 
WITH COLOURFUL WINGS FOR ALL TO SEE 
IF I COULD FLY 
JUST LIKE A BIRD 
I WISH THAT I COULD CREEP LIKE A MOUSE 
I'D SQUEAK AND SCAMPER AND RUN ABOUT THE HOUSE 
WITH EARS SO PINK AND NOSE SO SMALL 
I'D NEVER SCARE ANYBODY AT ALL 
IF I COULD CREEP 
JUST LIKE A MOUSE 
WISHING IS FUN 
EVERYONE HAS GOT THEIR FAVOURITE WISH 
IN YOUR DREAMS YOU CAN BE 
WHAT YOU WANT TO BE 
A CAT A DOG OR EVEN A FISH 
JUST SET YOURSELF FREE 
AND THEN YOU WILL SEE 
THAT NOTHING IS QUITE AS IT SEEMS 
IN YOUR WISHES 
AND YOUR DREAMS 
I WISH I WERE AS TALL AS A TREE 
I'D BE ABLE TO SEE 
AS FAR AS FAR CAN BE 
AND WHEN THE AUTUMN CAME AROUND 
I'D LET MY LEAVES FALL TO THE GROUND 
IF I COULD BE JUST LIKE A TREE 
I WISH THAT I COULD ZOOM INTO SPACE 
I'D HAVE A GREAT BIG SMILE UPON MY FACE 
I'D CHASE THE MOON AND TICKLE THE STARS 
AND THEN I'D HAVE MY DINNER ON MARS 
IF ONLY I COULD ZOOM UP INTO SPACE 
I WISH 
I WISH 
I WISH 
I WISH 
IT'S TIME FOR US TO ZOOM OFF NOW 
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE A TRAIN 
OR YOU COULD PRETEND TO BE ONE 
SEE YOU SOON BYE 
TIKKABILLA TIKKABILLA 
FUN FOR YOU AND ME 
TIKKABILLA TIKKABILLA 
WATCH AND YOU WILL SEE
