THEY HAVE EIGHT LEGS THEY HAVE EIGHT EYES AS WELL LEGS TELL ME MORE 
THIS IS THE NEPHILA 
SPIDER ALSO KNOWN AS THAT GOLDEN 
ORB SPIDER BECAUSE OF THE COLOUR 
OF THE WEB WHAT IS EXTRAORDINARY 
IS THE STRENGTH OF THE SILK IT IS 
DANCING FOR YOU NOW SHE WILL 
SETTLE DOWN THAT SILK I HAVE SEEN 
IT SPANNER FOREST CLEARINGS FIVE 
METRES ACROSS THEY CAN CATCH BIRDS 
IN IT WEIGHT FOR WEIGHT EACH 
STRAND OF THE SILK IS STRONGER THAN 
STEEL FOR A SPIDER THAT IS QUITE 
LITERALLY ITS LIFELINE IT USES IT 
TO CATCH FOOD

THEY 
THERE ARE NOT A DIFFERENT THEY SPECIES OF THESE SPIDERS IF WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT THE NEPHILA SPIDER 
THE FEMALES HERE SHE IS A GIRL

ABSOLUTELY MINISCULE HE IS A 
PARASITE IN THE WEB HE FEEDS ON 
FOOD THAT SHE CATCHES HE HAS TO 
SNEAK IN WHEN OPPORTUNITY ARISES
