BUT NOT FOR A YOUNG MAN 
LOOK PERHAPS IT'S PSYCHOLOGICAL 
IT'S PSYCHO PSYCHOSOMATIC YEAH THAT'S IT I HATE THE STUFF SO MUCH 
I'M HAVING A BAD REACTION TO IT OR YOU COULD BE PULLING A FAST ONE 
DO A BLOOD TEST THAT'LL SHOW YOU WHAT 
HOW THE SERATONE 
THE CHOCOLATE'S RAISED THE SEROTONIN CONCENTRATIONS IN MY SKIN 
THAT'S AN INTERESTING THEORY I'VE READ ALL ABOUT IT 
WHAT IN A MEDICAL JOURNAL NO ON THE INTERNET I WOULDN'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ THERE SON 
IT'S THE SEROTONIN DOING THIS MY IMMUNE SYSTEM CAN'T COPE SO IT'S HAVING THIS BAD REACTION 
TAKE THIS TO THE CHEMIST'S AND RUB IT ON THE RASH TWICE A DAY WHAT'S IT FOR 
INFLAMMATION CAUSED BY PLANTS

MAYBE HE WANTED ME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WENT THROUGH 
HE CAME IN HE SAW ME WHEN I WAS JUST ABOUT TO

YOU WITH THE RASH ME WITH THE PILLS 
HOW WOULD MY PILLS FOOL YOU 
HE WAS QUITE INSISTENT ON HAVING A BLOOD TEST 
IT'S MY FAULT THEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT SEROTONIN LEVELS 
IT'S MY GUESS HE TOOK THE PILLS TO BOOST THE SEROTONIN LEVEL IN HIS BLOOD 
HOPING WE'D THINK IT WAS THE CHOCOLATE AND THAT HIS BODY COULDN'T PROCESS IT PROPERLY 
HE MUST REALLY HATE ME TO GO TO THAT MUCH TROUBLE 
I HOPE YOUR DAD ISN'T LOOKING DOWN ON YOU NOW

HE'D BE PROUD OF ME 
PROUD OF YOUR LIES 
HE'D BE PROUD OF MY CREATIVE THINKING 
I HAD A PROBLEM AND I CAME UP WITH A RADICAL SOLUTION RADICAL
