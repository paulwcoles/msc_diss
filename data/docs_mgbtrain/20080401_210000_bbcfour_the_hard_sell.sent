SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME MAN HAS USED TOOLS APPARENTLY THAT SETS US APART FROM THE ANIMALS 
AND FROM THE FIRST FLINT ARROWHEADS TO P. D. A.'S MAN HAS FALLEN INTO THE TRAP OF DESIRING THE LATEST GADGET 
IF WE DON'T REALISE WE WANT IT THERE'S SOMEONE TELLING US WE DO 
AND WE ALL FALL FOR IT HOOK LINE AND SIM CARD 
THIS IS THE SEDUCTIVE WORLD OF TECHNOLOGY ADVERTISING 
EVERY BLOKE EVEN ON THE BREADLINE 
THOUSANDS OF POUNDS OVERDRAWN AND LIVING IN A BEDSIT 
IN A SLUM IN SOUTH LONDON 
THEY WILL STILL MAKE SURE THAT THEY EAT CAT FOOD IF THEY HAVE THE RIGHT MOBILE PHONE AND IPOD 
THERE IS A SORT OF LUST 
FOR THE NEW 
THEY BECOME MORE BEAUTIFUL MORE TACTILE 
SLEEKER BETTER MORE EFFICIENT 
FOR A MAN THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN DO 
THIS SEASON'S HANDBAG IS WITH THIS SEASON'S PHONE OR LAPTOP 
THEY'RE TRYING TO SELL US A LIFESTYLE 
A SORT OF WE'RE ON THE CUTTING EDGE WHERE IT'S HAPPENING 
THE LATEST GADGET MAKES US COOLER 
IT MAKES US MORE IN TOUCH WITH THE WORLD AROUND US 
FOR HALF A CENTURY T. V. ADVERTISERS HAVE HONED THEIR CRAFT 
CLEVERLY PERSUADING US TO SPEND HARD EARNED CASH ON DEVICES WE REALLY NEEDED 
NOW THEY WANT US TO BUY ALL THAT AND MORE 
WE'RE ALWAYS BEING CONVINCED WE'VE GOT TO BUY THE NEW THING 
OR WE'LL LOOK STUPID AND WEAK 
AND OLD FASHIONED AND FOOLISH TO OUR FRIENDS 
IF WE DON'T HAVE THE CASH DON'T WORRY A CREDIT CARD WILL DO NICELY 
THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD SAYS MORE ABOUT YOU THAN CASH EVER CAN I RECOMMEND YOU APPLY NOW 
NOW WE'RE KNEE DEEP IN A TRILLION POUND OF DEBT BUT WE DON'T CARE 
WE WANT THEM AND WE TRICK OURSELVES INTO THINKING WE ACTUALLY NEED THEM 
AND WE NEED TO HAVE THE LATEST ONE 
SO MUCH OF ADVERTISING IS BASED AROUND OUR INSECURITIES IT'S NOT ABOUT OUR FANTASIES IT'S OUR FEARS 
TODAY'S AD CAMPAIGNS FOR TECHNOLOGY ARE SO CLEVER WE BARELY UNDERSTAND THEM HOW ABOUT THIS ONE 
IS IT FOR A CAR MOBILE PHONE BUILDING SOCIETY 
SOME SAY THEY'RE CONFUSING ANNOYING PRETENTIOUS 
BUT IN THE ADVERTISING WORLD THIS COLOURFUL SONY ADVERT IS PURE GOLD 
ADVERTISING IS EFFECTIVE IF IT CREATES EMOTIONAL COMMUNICATION 
IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR LATEST ADVERTISING THEY REALLY HAVE LEARNED 
HOW TO DO THAT YOU HAVE THESE BALLS BOUNCING AROUND 
IN A SAN FRANCISCO SETTING 
YOU HAVE THIS BRILLIANT MUSIC TRACK PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND 
YOU HAVE NO WORDS AT ALL NO MESSAGE NO EXPLANATION 
WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW COLOURFUL YOUR T. V. CAN BE BY RAMMING COLOURS DOWN YOUR FACE 
I THINK THAT'S WHY IT WORKED IT WAS JUST A SPECTACULAR AD 
IT WAS A REALLY SIMPLE IDEA 
UNLEASH THE BALLS SO TO SPEAK 
YOU WANTED TO WATCH IT ALMOST AS A MINI MOVIE IT WAS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL VISUAL FEAST 
AND IT MADE THE PRODUCT DELECTABLE IT CERTAINLY WORKED WITH ME 
I BOUGHT THE T. V. AND THE SOUNDTRACK WHICH WAS JOSE GONZALEZ TO THE ADVERT 
I BOUGHT EVERY ELEMENT THAT THEY SOLD I GOT IT ALL 
AND NOW EXPENSIVE LOOKING LUSH IMAGES LIKE THESE 
HAVE BECOME THE HALLMARKS OF THE BIGGER BUDGET CAMPAIGN 
EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT THEY MEAN TECHNOLOGY ADVERTISING WASN'T ALWAYS LIKE THIS 
IN THE FIFTIES IT WAS STRAIGHTFORWARD 
BRITISH MOTORISTS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE FIRST TO BENEFIT FROM DEVELOPMENTS IN CAR LUBRICATION 
THANKS TO CASTROL 
CASTROL HAS THE LARGEST SALE OF ANY MOTOR OIL IN BRITAIN 
DON'T TAKE CHANCES ALWAYS ASK FOR CASTROL BY NAME 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE OLDER TECHNOLOGY ADVERTS THEY TALK ABOUT BEING NEW 
MODERN EXCITING LABOUR SAVING 
AND THEY CONCENTRATE ON THE THING 
AND TELL YOU QUITE A LOT OF DETAILS ABOUT THE THING THEY MIGHT PUT IT IN A LIFESTYLE SETTING 
BUT THE ACCENT IS VERY MUCH AROUND THE NEWNESS THE MODERNITY OF THE ACTUAL PRODUCT OR THING 
SO AS WE EMERGED FROM THE POST WAR AUSTERITY OF THE FIFTIES 
ADVERTISING'S MAIN OBJECTIVE WAS TO SELL DEVICES FOR THE HOUSEHOLD OR A CAR IF YOU COULD AFFORD ONE 
AND WE SPENT SPENT SPENT 
WHAT YOU GET FROM THE MID FIFTIES TO MID SIXTIES IS A HUGE EXPLOSION OF SPENDING ON WHITE GOODS 
THE CLASSIC ONE IS THE WASHING MACHINE 
IT'S PROBABLY THE SINGLE MOST LIBERATING DEVICE EVER INVENTED 
IT LIBERATES WOMEN FROM THIS ROUTINE OF WEEKLY DRUDGERY 
AND THEY CAN THINK ABOUT GOING OUT TO WORK OR BACK INTO EDUCATION THINGS THEY COULDN'T DO BEFORE 
ALL THESE WHITE GOODS ARE HUGELY IMPORTANT IN THE SOCIAL HISTORY OF MODERN BRITAIN 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE OLD WHITE GOODS ADVERTISING FROM THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES 
IT WAS ABOUT HELPING WOMEN DO THEIR JOBS BETTER BE A BETTER HOUSEWIFE MOTHER WIFE 
THESE DAYS 
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE IN A CONTEXT OF A RICHER MORE FULFILLED WOMAN'S LIFE 
BUT IT'S STILL HELPING YOU DO YOUR JOB BETTER 
GUYS GET ALL THE BOY'S TOYS ADVERTISING 
IT'S ALL ABOUT LEISURE AND CUTTING EDGE LIFESTYLE 
DECORATING TIME BLACK AND DECKERATING TIME 
BLACK AND DECKER MEN ARE ON THE MOVE 
AND THE GADGETS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAVE ALWAYS CHANGED 
ACCORDING TO DESIRABILITY NOVELTY FASHION OR DEMAND 
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNOLOGY MEN GET MOST OF THE ATTENTION BECAUSE BOYS LOVE THEIR TOYS 
IF YOU LOOKED AT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
MEN HAD LARGE NUMBERS OF METAL THINGS TO BANG AND STOKE WITH COAL AND MOVE WITH LARGE SPANNERS 
IT WAS A VERY BLOKISH WORLD MOST THINGS WERE HEAVY INDUSTRIAL TOUGH COMPLICATED AND MECHANISED 
NOWADAYS MEN DON'T HAVE UNLESS YOU'RE A MOTORCYCLE FREAK 
THE SAME OUTLETS FOR BLOKISHNESS 
AND DIGITAL GADGETRY TO SOME DEGREE PROVIDES THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY EQUIVALENT OF THE TRAIN SET 
I'M THE OPERATOR WITH MY POCKET CALCULATOR 
OUR LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE SILICON CHIP STARTED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND WE'RE STILL SMITTEN BY THE DIGITAL BUG 
THOUGH NOWADAYS WE'D LAUGH AT THE PRIMITIVE SPEC OF THESE GADGETS 
O. K. IT TELLS THE TIME AND WHAT ELSE THAT'S IT 
I SAY THAT'S A REALLY NICE WATCH YOU'RE WEARING 
IN REAL TERMS WRISTWATCHES DO NOT HAVE THE CULTURAL CACHET 
THEY HAD IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES PEOPLE DO NOT ASSESS PEOPLE 
HOWEVER MUCH ROLEX WEARERS THINK ON THE VALUE OF THEIR WRISTWATCH 
EXPLORE WITH TIMEX A NEW WORLD OF QUARTZ DIGITAL TIMEKEEPING 
DISCOVER STOPWATCH AND ALARM IN ONE CALCULATE WITH DESIGN AND STYLE 
THEY'RE VERY TECHNO ADVERTS BUILDING TECHNOLOGY INTO ALMOST ANYTHING BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY'S GOOD 
TO BE MODERN WAS TO BE TECHNICAL 
IT WAS THE TIME OF THE SPACE RACE ET CETERA 
IN GENERAL THERE WAS THIS TREMENDOUS ENTHUSIASM THAT PROBLEMS WOULD BE SOLVED THROUGH TECHNOLOGY 
MOST ADVERTISING OF THE ERA TAPS INTO THAT 
NEW GILLETTE FUSION WE STILL HAVE ECHOES OF IT TODAY 
IF WE LOOK AT THE KIND OF SHAVING TECHNOLOGIES 
WE'VE GONE FROM ONE BLADE TO TWO TO FOUR 
AND IT'S STILL SEEN AS A LEGITIMATE WAY TO POSITION A PRODUCT 
AH YOU'LL BE LUCKY SORRY OLYMPUS TRIP A. F. NO NO 
COULDN'T SNAP TWIGS 
BY THE LATE SEVENTIES THE SMARTER WAY TO ADVERTISE A GADGET WAS TO AVOID TECHNO TALK AND USE HUMOUR 
AND IF YOU WERE LUCKY A CELEBRITY EXPERT 
WITH OLYMPUS CAMERAS WHAT CDP DID WHICH WAS VERY CLEVER 
WAS TAKE LOTS OF TECHNICAL INNOVATION 
AND MADE SURE IT WAS TALKED ABOUT BY ACTORS IN A HUMOROUS WAY 
AN INNOVATION LIKE RED EYE REDUCTION 
WAS PUT ACROSS IN A HUMOROUS WAY THAT MADE CONSUMERS UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT THAT CAMERA OFFERED 
WASTE OF TIME WITHOUT A LIGHT READING THIS IS AUTOMATIC 
I DID THESE ADVERTS FOR OLYMPUS WITH DAVID BAILEY 
HE'S PROBABLY YOU KNOW HE'S SO ICONIC AS A PHOTOGRAPHER 
AND HE WAS VERY FASHIONABLE HE IS VERY FASHIONABLE 
AND SO FOR HIM TO TAKE PICTURES WITH THIS FUNNY LITTLE CAMERA WAS QUITE NICE 
D'YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS WHO DAVID BAILEY 
DAVID BAILEY WHO'S HE 
VERY SOON IT BECAME VERY OBVIOUS' 
THAT YOU COULD GET ALMOST ANYBODY FOR A T. V. COMMERCIAL IF YOU PAID ENOUGH MONEY THAT'S HOW WE GOT BAILEY 
ALAN PARKER MADE A SPECIALITY OF CELEBRITY LED ADS HERE'S ANOTHER ONE WITH PENELOPE KEITH 
THE BAD NEWS FOR GADGET CONSCIOUS GIRLS IN THOSE DAYS WAS THAT YOU'D ONLY GET A PEN THAT WORKED 
NO NO NO FELICITY YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY GO SHOPPING IN KNIGHTSBRIDGE WITH ONE OF THOSE 
A PEN WITH STYLE A PEN WITH ELAN A PARKER LADY IN WHITE ROLLED GOLD 
IF THAT COMMERCIAL WORKS 
IT'S BECAUSE SHE IS SO BRILLIANT 
IN THE END IF YOU HAVE A SENSATIONAL CENTRAL PERFORMANCE IN ANYTHING THEN PROBABLY IT'LL WORK REALLY WELL 
DOES ONE SPELL PENCE WITH AN S. OR A C. I DON'T THINK YOU NEED WORRY 
CELEBRITIES POPPED UP EVERYWHERE 
THOSE AWFULLY NICE SONY PEOPLE TELL ME YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE SELLING YOUR LOVED ONE ON A NICE NEW HI FI 
JOHN CLEESE URGED US TO DUPE THE WIFE INTO THINKING A SONY HI FI 
REMEMBER THOSE WAS ACTUALLY CONTEMPORARY FURNITURE 
AND ERIC AND ERNIE WOULD BE FOUND HAPPILY EXTOLLING THE VIRTUES OF ENVIRONMENTALLY UNFRIENDLY OIL 
DID YOU HEAR THAT AH THAT'S A SPARE 
THEY WERE ALL AT IT HERE'S ANOTHER FAMOUS DUO SELLING THE LATEST BRITISH LEYLAND RANGE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR 
NEW SOUNDPROOFING AND TURNS ON A SIXPENCE NOT THAT I HAVE SIXPENCE 
YOU'RE NOT SHORT NOT COMPARED WITH YOU 
BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE CAR THE BIGGEST GADGET OF THEM ALL 
THE MORE TRADITIONAL WAY TO DOLLY BIRDS AND THE OPEN ROAD 
AND FORGET ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING 
I THINK CAR ADVERTISING HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED 
LONG GONE ARE THE DAYS OF THE WINDY ROAD THROUGH TUSCANY THE ROCK TRACK 
BASICALLY A MOVING BROCHURE 
EACH WINTER THE SHERWOODS THE SVENSONS AND THE DIETRICHS DRIVE TO THEIR SKI CHALETS 
SOON ADVERTISERS MADE SURE THEY POSITIONED THEIR BRAND ACCURATELY IN AN EXCLUSIVE WAY 
IN THE CASE OF AUDI THEY HIT THE JACKPOT WITH A SLOGAN THAT WAS JUST A LITTLE SMUG 
ONE THING WE HAD TO DO WAS ESTABLISH IT AS A GERMAN MARK IT'S NOT A VERY GERMAN SOUNDING NAME 
UNLIKE MERCEDES OR VOLKSWAGEN 
IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO REFLECT THAT IT WAS A GERMAN BRAND 
GERMAN ENGINEERING IS ADMIRED 
WHEN I WAS IN GERMANY AT THEIR FACTORY I WAS WANDERING ROUND 
AND I SAW THIS OLD SLOGAN ON THE WALL I SAID WHAT WAS THAT 
HE SAID AN OLD ADVERTISING SLOGAN 
AND WHEN I CAME BACK WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT DO WE DO I SAID BRING BACK THE SLOGAN THEY USED 
IN GERMANY MANY YEARS AGO AND SAY IT IN GERMAN 
VORSPRUNG DURCH TECHNIK BUT PRONOUNCE IT BADLY 
VORSPRUNG DURCH TECHNIK AS THEY SAY IN GERMANY 
IN A SENSE WE WERE SORT OF LAUGHING AND SMILING AT GERMAN ENGINEERING 
BUT IN A VERY INTERESTING WAY 
SOMETHING ABOUT CAR ADVERTISING BRINGS OUT THE HIGHBROW IN AD MEN 
THIS MARRIAGE OF ROSSINI AND ROBOTICS FOR THE FIAT STRADA PROVED VERY POPULAR IN EIGHTIES BRITAIN 
DESPITE OUR OWN EMPTY CAR FACTORIES GATHERING DUST 
THE TEAM THAT WORKED ON THAT VISITED THE FACTORY 
AND THEY WERE AMAZED TO FIND THERE WERE VERY FEW PEOPLE IN IT 
IT WAS ALL DONE BY ROBOTS 
SOMEBODY HAD THE GREAT IDEA OF HANDBUILT BY ROBOTS 
PEOPLE CONSIDERED THAT A WONDERFUL THING ROBOTS COULD DELIVER SEAMLESS WELDING TIME AFTER TIME 
WITHOUT EVER MAKING A MISTAKE 
PUT IT INTO THE CONTEXT OF THE EARLY EIGHTIES THIS IS THE STAR WARS PERIOD 
THIS IS THE PERIOD OF HIGH TECHERY BEING A SALEABLE FASHIONABLE CONCEPT 
AND SO YOU GET ADVERTS LIKE THAT 
AT A TIME WHEN THAT TYPE OF COMPLEX HIGH TECH ENGINEERING 
IS SOMETHING THAT'S VIEWABLE ON EVERY MOVIE SCREEN AND IS HIGHLY CURRENT 
IT REPRESENTS A CERTAIN MOMENT A SOCIO CULTURAL MOMENT IN TERMS OF FILMIC IMAGE BASICALLY 
RAINDROPS ON ROSES AND WHISKERS ON KITTENS 
BRIGHT COPPER KETTLES AND WARM 
A SUCCESSFUL CAR CAMPAIGN CAN TURN AROUND A BRAND'S IMAGE CZECH CAR COMPANY SKODA 
HAD A POOR REPUTATION LIKE LADA THINGS LOOKED UP IN THE NINETIES WHEN VOLKSWAGEN TOOK THEM OVER 
AND GAVE THEM A DECENT ADVERTISING BUDGET AND NOW THIS HIGH CALORIE COMMERCIAL SUMS UP CAR ADVERTISING 
FOSSIL FUEL GUZZLING CAR REPRESENTED AS CAKE JELLY AND TREACLE 
MMM 
SKODA IS SO FRESH 
IT'S SO DIFFERENT 
IT'S BROUGHT PLEASURE TO PEOPLE 
AND IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS A PIECE OF COMMUNICATION 
IT LEAVES YOU WITH ONE CLEAR POINT OF VIEW THE PLEASURE OF CREATING SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WILL LOVE 
SILVER WHITE WINTERS THAT MELT INTO SPRINGS THESE ARE A FEW OF MY FAVOURITE THINGS 
IT STEMMED FROM THE FACT THAT OF ALL DRIVERS IN THIS COUNTRY 
SKODA DRIVERS WERE THE MOST CONTENT WITH THEIR CAR 
SO WE THOUGHT YOU DON'T MAKE CARS YOU MANUFACTURE HAPPY DRIVERS 
HOW COOL IS THAT VERY FEW OF THEM AROUND 
AND FROM THAT 
THE IDEA WAS IF THEY'RE HAPPY DRIVERS IT MUST MEAN THE CAR IS FULL OF LOVELY STUFF 
THAT'S WHERE THE CAKE IDEA IS FROM 
AND THEN THERE WAS THE RENAULT MEGANE AD WHOSE CHIEF ATTRIBUTE WAS TO USE BOOTY 
TO SELL A CAR WITH A BIG BOOT 
CAR ADVERTISING HAS GONE REALLY RANDOM 
THERE'S NO MORE ABOUT THE ULTIMATE DRIVING MACHINE OR HOW THEY DRIVE 
THEY ALL SEEM TO PICK 
DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE CAR TO SELL 
HATE SOMETHING CHANGE SOMETHING 
HATE SOMETHING CHANGE SOMETHING MAKE SOMETHING BETTER 
YES NOWADAYS CAR ADS WILL FOCUS ON ANYTHING RATHER THAN REMIND US 
THAT THEY'RE SELLING US A SMELLY EXHAUST BELCHING PLANET ENDANGERING CONTRAPTION 
THEY'RE CAKES WITH SEXY BOTTOMS OR THEY'RE NOT CARS AT ALL JUST A CONCEPT TO FULFIL YOUR DREAMS 
IN THE SAME VEIN PETROL GIANTS HAVE CONVINCED US THEY'RE ECO WARRIORS 
THEY'VE MOVED THEMSELVES FROM BEING REGARDED AS A SOURCE OF POLLUTANTS 
TOWARDS TRYING TO POSITION THEMSELVES 
VERY MUCH AS PART OF THE SOLUTION FOR THE FUTURE 
AND THEY DO THAT 
BY BEING SLIGHTLY OBLIQUE ABOUT THEIR BASIC PRODUCT BUT TELLING US WHERE THEY'RE GOING 
WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND HOW NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL HELP IN THE FUTURE 
WHAT WE DREAM TODAY WE CAN ACHIEVE TOMORROW 
AS THE INDUSTRY'S CHANGED 
IT'S NOT PUMPING OUT GASES 
IT'S BEING MUCH MORE ECONOMICAL 
THAT INTRODUCES A NEW TYPE OF SEXINESS TO DIFFERENT BRANDS 
LET'S GO BACK TO SIMPLER DAYS 
TO THE DAWN OF COMPUTERS WHEN THEY WERE STRICTLY THE DOMAIN OF QUALIFIED OPERATORS 
THE EIGHTIES SAW SUCH MASSIVE ADVANCES IN MICROCHIPS THAT A COMPUTER FOR THE HOME BECAME A REALITY 
BRITAIN MADE P. C.'S LIKE THE ACORN THE B. B. C. MICRO 
AND THE SINCLAIR Z. X. SPECTRUM 
IN AMERICA A COMPUTING GIANT WAS ABOUT TO BE BORN 
THIS GROUNDBREAKING COMMERCIAL DIRECTED BY RIDLEY SCOTT REFERENCED THE YEAR OF ITS LAUNCH 
NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR 
WHERE EACH WORKER MAY BLOOM SECURE FROM THE PESTS OF CONTRADICTORY THOUGHTS 
THE RIDLEY SCOTT EPIC AD FOR APPLE 
THE TAKE OFF OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR YEAH IT DOES SELL APPLE COMPUTERS 
BUT THE WAY IT SELLS IT IS NOT WITH A MESSAGE IT SELLS IT 
BY PUTTING APPLE IN A PLACE WHERE OTHER COMPUTERS AREN'T 
IT TAKES APPLE FROM BEING THE MUNDANE THE I. B. M. 
THE TOSHIBA ALL THE OTHER BRANDS 
AND IT SAYS WE'RE OVER HERE WE'RE DIFFERENT 
WE WANT TO CHANGE THE WAY THINGS ARE DONE AND IT DOES IT WITH AN ANALOGY TO NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR 
THAT AT THE TIME WAS INSPIRED 
HELLO I'M A MAC AND I'M A P. C. 
I DO FUN STUFF LIKE MOVIES MUSIC PODCASTS AND I ALSO DO FUN STUFF LIKE SPREADSHEETS AND TIMESHEETS 
AND PIE CHARTS 
APPLE IS SEEN TO BE A BIT ARTY ALTHOUGH IT'S A BIG CORPORATE BUSINESS JUST LIKE MICROSOFT 
SOMEHOW IT'S MANAGED TO RETAIN THIS IDEA THAT IT'S A BIT HIPPY 
A FRIENDLY SORT OF A THING 
DOWN THE ROAD OF SELLING ITSELF IN THE GERMAN MANNER 
OF BEING THE EFFICIENT OFFICE MACHINE ENGINEERED WELL FOR SERIOUS USE 
IN THE WORLD OF THE LAPTOP 
THE MAC OWNS THAT SPHERE OF PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO CONSIDER THEMSELVES ARTY AND CREATIVE 
IN ANY WAY 
THE I. B. M. LAPTOP THE THINKPAD 
IS AS ONE FRIEND DESCRIBED IT THE KALASHNIKOV OF THE BUSINESS WORLD 
IT'S A VERY HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL 
ROBUST STRONG UNELABORATE BUT VERY RELIABLE TOOL WHICH A SERIOUS BUSINESS PERSON WOULD TAKE 
ANOTHER GADGET THAT STARTED LIFE AS A BUSINESS TOOL WAS THE MOBILE PHONE 
WHICH REEKED OF CORPORATE STATUS AND WAS USED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BY BUSINESSMEN 
BUT IN A FEW YEARS ORDINARY PEOPLE STARTED TO USE THEM AND WITH TEXTING AND PAY AS YOU GO 
SUDDENLY EVERYBODY COULD HAVE ONE AND AD AGENCIES WENT INTO A CREATIVE FEEDING FRENZY 
MANUFACTURERS LOAD MOBILE PHONES WITH LOADS OF DIFFERENT DEVICES 
AND FUNCTIONALITY AND PEOPLE DON'T USE THEM 
PEOPLE USE THEM TO CALL PEOPLE TEXT PEOPLE AND LOOK UP THE TIME 
THEY DON'T USE THIS OTHER FUNCTIONALITY AT ALL FOR ADVERTISERS THAT'S A PROBLEM 
HOW DO YOU SELL THIS SUPER EXPENSIVE SUPER ENABLED PHONE TO SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T WANT ALL THOSE FUNCTIONS 
THE ANSWER IS YOU MAKE IT COOL YOU MAKE IT SEEM THE PHONE TO HAVE 
THIS IS THE ONE THAT YOU NEED IT LOOKS GOOD YOU'LL FEEL COOL 
IT'S AMAZING WHAT FITS IN A POCKET THESE DAYS 
YOUR FAVOURITE MUSIC 
WITH MOBILE PHONES THERE ARE PHONES THAT ARE FOR THE LADIES 
AND THEY DON'T WORK WELL AND HAVE CRAPPY CAMERAS 
AND THEY'RE PINK WITH A CAT OR SOME DIAMANTE ON THEM 
THAT'S HOW COMPREHENSIVELY BOFFINS HAVE APPLIED THEIR GENIUS TO THE FEMALE MARKET 
ONE ELEMENT OF MOBILE PHONES IS AS A FASHION ACCESSORY 
AND SO PEOPLE WANT TO UPDATE IT LIKE THEY RENEW THEIR CLOTHES 
THEY RENEW THEIR CARS 
PEOPLE MOVE HOMES CHANGE WIVES CHANGE HUSBANDS 
POLITICAL PARTIES CHANGE THEIR NAME THEY USE THE GREAT MARKETING WORD NEW IT'S GONE ON FOREVER 
MOBILE PHONE ADVERTISING HAS SHIFTED FOCUS FROM THE HANDSET TO THE SERVICE PROVIDERS 
BUT SINCE THERE ISN'T MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM THEY GO FOR ABSTRACT CONCEPTS 
ONCE AGAIN THIS IS THE HIGH END OF TELEVISION ADVERTISING BUT WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO SAY 
STATUS IS STILL A HUGE PART OF ADVERTISING 
THERE IS STILL A CERTAIN LEVEL THAT SOMEHOW YOU BUY LUXURY 
BUT A LOT OF THEM BUY CONTENTMENT THAT'S A BETTER WORD 
YOU BUY CONTENTMENT AND THE IDEA IS THAT THE MOBILE PHONE IS MERELY A MECHANISM 
TO INCREASE YOUR POTENTIAL OF FRIENDSHIPS AND SOCIABILITY 
EFFECTIVELY WHAT YOU'RE SELLING ARE THE FRIENDSHIPS AND SOCIABILITY THAT THE PHONE COULD GIVE YOU 
NOT THE PHONE ITSELF 
AND HERE THEY GO WITH THE COLOURS AGAIN IS IT A BUILDING SOCIETY A WIDESCREEN T. V. NOPE 
JUST A KOOKY ADVERT WITH FREE SPIRITS AND AN OFFBEAT SOUNDTRACK 
I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF ADS NOW 
THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON ARE ALMOST INDECIPHERABLE 
A DESIRE TO CREATE BRAND PERSONALITY IN A ME TOO AREA LIKE TECHNOLOGY 
LIKE PHONES OR NEW MEDIA 
YOU DO SIT THERE IN BREAKS WATCHING TELLY AND SAYING WHAT ON EARTH IS ALL THAT ABOUT 
ON THE FACE OF IT ADVERTISING IS CHANGING 
AND SOME OF IT IS DRIVEN BY THE KIND OF TECHNOLOGY BEING ADVERTISED 
SOME CAMPAIGNS ARE IRRITATINGLY OBSCURE BUT ONE CONSTANT HASN'T CHANGED 
ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THE BUSINESS IS THAT FORTY YEARS AGO THE TOP THREE SPENDERS WERE 
CONSUMER PRODUCTS SOAP POWDER TOILET SOAP TOOTHPASTE 
NOW THEY ARE MOBILE PHONES TELEVISION SETS IPODS 
ITUNES OR WHATEVER THE LATEST THING IS THEY ARE THE BIG SPENDERS 
APART FROM THE GOVERNMENT THE BIGGEST SPENDER WHY IS THAT 
IT'S HAPPENED BECAUSE THE MARK UP ON A MOBILE PHONE THE MARK UP ON A TELEVISION 
IS SUFFICIENTLY LARGE TO JUSTIFY LARGE ADVERTISING EXPENDITURE 
AND PROFITS ARE QUITE CONSIDERABLE 
AND OUR OBSESSIONS WITH GADGETS HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND COMPUTERS HAVE COALESCED IN THE FORM 
OF THE M. P. THREE PLAYER APPLE SEEM TO HAVE ACHIEVED WORLD DOMINATION WITH THEIR IPOD RANGE 
REWIND 
WHAT THEY DID INSTEAD OF BOMBARDING YOU WITH HOW MANY GIGS IT WAS 
HOW IT WORKED THE INTERFACE 
THEY SIMPLY TOOK A LOAD OF PRIMARY COLOURS AND A SILHOUETTE OF SOMEONE DANCING 
AND GAVE THE IMAGE THAT WITH THIS LITTLE WHITE BOX YOU WILL HAVE FUN AND EVERYBODY WANTED THE IPOD 
NOT THAT WEARING HEADPHONES IN PUBLIC AND STARING BLANKLY IS NEW 
WE TEND TO FORGET THAT THIRTY YEARS AGO SONY RULED MINIATURE HI FI WITH THE WALKMAN 
LONG BEFORE THE IPOD TOOK OVER BUT THAT'S ANCIENT HISTORY 
WE AS A GADGET GUZZLING GENERATION ARE OBSESSED WITH THE FUTURE 
FOR ME THE WHOLE THING IS REALLY NOT ABOUT TECHNOLOGY 
IT'S MUCH MORE ABOUT YOU COULD GO AS HIGH UP AS THE LIBERATION OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS 
PEOPLE SHARE INFORMATION COMMUNICATE TO EACH OTHER IN A MUCH BROADER WAY NOW 
IT'S NOT ABOUT EMAIL OR FACEBOOK OR YOUTUBE OR ANY OF THESE THINGS 
IT'S ABOUT THE HUMAN INTENT AND THE NEED AND DESIRE THEY FULFIL 
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE ONE WE ARE THE WORLD IS GOING LIKE THAT 
HERE'S A BRAND THAT IS IN PURSUIT OF BRINGING THE FUTURE TO YOU 
SO THE END BENEFIT THE FLUFFY END THE BIT THAT NOBODY ADMITS TO 
IS IF I'M BUYING BRAND X. I'M KIND OF ON THE FOREFRONT HERE 
AND I KIND OF HAVE MY HEADLIGHT BEAM ONTO WHAT'S COMING RATHER THAN REFLECTING BACK ON THE PAST 
WHEN YOU BUY AN ARISTON 
THROUGH THE AGES WE'VE BEEN SOLD THE LINE THAT NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL IMPROVE OUR LIVES 
AND WE'VE BOUGHT INTO THAT NOTION WHOLEHEARTEDLY 
BUT THE VERY TECHNOLOGY WE'VE BEEN SOLD COULD END T. V. ADVERTISING AS WE KNOW IT 
TELEVISION WILL BECOME LESS IMPORTANT AS A MEDIUM FOR ADVERTISING 
AND THEY'LL LOOK AT SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES CERTAINLY THE INTERNET AND VIRAL MARKETING 
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT 
THEY'VE GOT TO FIND WAYS TO ADVERTISE THEIR PRODUCT WHERE IT WILL BE SEEN 
AND PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO FAST FORWARD THROUGH IT 
BUT LET'S FACE IT AS LONG AS WE KEEP CONSUMING SPENDING AND ASPIRING 
THE AD MEN WILL BE OUT THERE SELLING US SHINY SHINY THINGS TO IMPROVE OUR COSY EXISTENCE 
VORSPRUNG DURCH TECHNIK AS THEY SAY IN GERMANY
