BRITAIN STANDS SOLIDLY BEHIND 
DEMOCRACY FOR ZIMBABWE GORDON 
BROWN'S MESSAGE AS HE MEETS LEADERS 
AT THE UN IN NEW YORK NO ONE NO ONE THINKS HAVING SEEN THE RESULTS AT 
POLLING STATIONS THAT ROBERT 
MUGABE HAS WON THIS ELECTION A 
STOLEN ELECTION WOULD NOT BE A 
DEMOCRATIC ELECTION AT ALL 
FRANCE TAKES DIRECT ACTION AGAINST 
PIRACY SIX SOMALIS ARE FLOWN TO 
PARIS TO FACE TRIAL FOR HIJACKING A 
LUXURY YACHT A STUDY INTO VITAMINS 
SAY TAKING CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTS 
COULD LEAD TO PREMATURE DEATH YOU 
SOMETIMES WISH THE SCIENTISTS WOULD 
MAKE UP THEIR MINDS WE ASK AUTHORS 
AT THE LONDON BOOK FAIR FOR THEIR 
TIPS 
THE PIECE OF ADVICE IS WRITE TIPS ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW THAT IS THE 
WORST PIECE OF ADVICE GIVEN IN ANY 
FIELD OF HUMAN ENDEAVOUR 
HELLO THE UNITED NATIONS MUST SEND 
A SINGLE CLEAR MESSAGE THAT IT 
STANDS FOR DEMOCRACY FOR HUMAN 
RIGHTS IN ZIMBABWE THAT WAS THE 
CALL FROM BRITISH PRIME MINISTER 
GORDON BROWN TODAY HE WAS 
SPEAKING BEFORE GOING INTO A 
MEETING WITH AFRICAN LEADERS IN NEW 
YORK THERE HE SAID AS FAR AS HE 
WAS CONCERNED HE AND OTHER WESTERN 
GOVERNMENTS WANT THE TALKS TO 
DISCUSS THE POLITICAL DEADLOCK IN 
ZIMBABWE MANY OBSERVERS BELIEVE HE 
LOST THE ELECTION THREE WEEKS AGO 
THERE ARE NO OFFICIAL RESULTS FROM 
THE VOTE THERE ARE SIGNS THAT MANY 
AFRICAN STATESMEN INCLUDING THABO 
MBEKI RESENT WHAT THEY SEE AS 
OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE HERE IS OUR 
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT 
GORDON BROWN'S MOTORCADE SWEEPS 
THROUGH MANHATTAN DESTINATION THE 
UNITED NATIONS THE MISSION TO TURN 
UP THE PRESSURE ON PRESIDENT MUGABE 
FIRST A HANDSHAKE AND TALKS WITH UN 
SECRETARY GENERAL BAN KI MOON HE 
IS FIRMLY ON THE SIDE WITH BRITAIN 
FRANCE AND THE UNITED STATES ALL 
DEMANDING THE RELEASE OF ZIMBABWE'S 
ELECTION RESULTS AND RESPECT FOR 
DEMOCRACY IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL 
THE UN'S MOST POWERFUL BODY DEEP 
DIVISION SOUTH AFRICA IS IN THE 
CHAIR THIS MONTH P. L. T. MBEKI DENIES 
THERE IS ANY SORT OF CRISIS IN 
ZIMBABWE TO HIM TO OTHERS IN 
AFRICA BRITAIN'S PRIME MINISTER 
WAS BLUNT 
NO ONE THINKS HAVING 
SEEN THE RESULTS AT POLLING 
STATIONS THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE HAS 
WON THIS ELECTION A STOLEN 
ELECTION WOULD NOT BE A DEMOCRATIC 
ELECTION AT ALL AS A GENERAL 
SECRETARY AS SAID THE CREDIBILITY 
OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS DEPENDS 
ON THERE BEING A LEGITIMATE 
GOVERNMENT SO LET A SINGLE CLEAR 
MESSAGE GO OUT FROM HERE IN NEW 
YORK THAT WE ARE AND WILL BE 
VIGILANT FOR DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS 
THAT WE STAND SOLIDLY BEHIND HUMAN 
RIGHTS FOR ZIMBABWE AND WE STAND 
READY TO SUPPORT ZIMBABWEANS BUILD 
A BETTER FUTURE 
THAT AMOUNTS TO A 
REBUKE TO AFRICAN LEADERS DEFENDING 
OR PROTECTING PRESIDENT MUGABE THE 
UN SECRETARY GENERAL PUT HIS 
AUTHORITY BEHIND THE PRESSURE FOR 
ACTION FROM SOUTHERN AFRICAN STATES 
THE ZIMBABWEAN AUTHORITIES AND THE 
COUNTRIES OH THE REGION HAVE 
INSISTED THAT THESE MATTERS ARE FOR 
THE REGION TO RESOLVE BUT THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CONTINUES 
TO WATCH AND WAIT FOR DECISIVE 
ACTION THE CREDIBILITY OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN AFRICA COULD 
BE AT STAKE HERE IF THERE IS A 
SECOND ROUND OF ELECTIONS THEY 
MUST BE CONDUCTED IN A FAIR AND 
TRANSPARENT MANNER WITH 
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS 
BUT MOST 
AFRICAN LEADERS SIMPLY DIDN'T WANT 
ZIMBABWE NAMED AT ALL IN TODAY'S 
DEBATE ON CHALLENGES FACING THE 
CONTINENT IN HIS SPEECH PRESIDENT 
MBEKI MADE NO MENTION OF ZIMBABWE 
FOCUSING ON HOW TO BOLSTER TIES 
BETWEEN THE UN AND THE AFRICAN 
UNION 
OUR PEACE MAKING EFFORT ON UNION THE AFRICAN CONTINENT HAVE SHOWN 
CONFLICTS REQUIRE AN APPROACH WHICH 
PLACES THE VIEWS AND EFFORTS OF THE 
AFFECTED COUNTRY AND ITS PEOPLE AT 
THE CENTRE FOR A SEARCH FOR A 
PEACEFUL SOLUTION 
SO THIS WAS A 
DIALOGUE WITHOUT MUCH DIALOGUE 
EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES AND 
THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL ALL 
PUSHING ZIMBABWE TO THE CENTRE OF 
THIS AFRICA DEBATE AFRICAN LEADERS 
EQUALLY DETERMINED TO TRY AND KEEP 
THE ISSUE OFF THE UN AGENDA 
SO CAN ANYTHING BE ACHIEVED BY 
EXERTING OUTSIDE PRESSURE ON 
ZIMBABWE WITH ME IS PETER 
LONGWORTH FORMER BRITISH HIGH 
COMMISSIONER IN IN ZIMBABWE CAN 
ANYTHING BE ACHIEVED 
IT CAN IT IS 
IMPORTANT THAT THINGS MOVE UP A 
STAGE QUITE RIGHTLY WE HAVE WAITED 
TO SEE WHAT THE AFRICAN NATIONS CAN 
DO ABOUT A CRISIS IN THEIR BACK 
YARD NOW THEY CLAIM THERE IS NO 
CRISIS AND IT IS MANAGEABLE 
ALTHOUGH BY HOM IT IS ANOTHER 
QUESTION IS NOW A MOVE TO THIS 
DISCUSSION IN THE UNITED NATIONS 
WHAT WAS CLEAR FROM WHAT WE HAVE 
SEEN IS A VERY STRONG UNUSUALLY 
STRONG COMMENT ON THE SITUATION IN 
ZIMBABWE THE UN 
ROBERT MUGABE 
IS USED TO THAT 
THIS IS THE UN 
SECRETARY GENERAL HE IS USED TO IT 
FOR PEOPLE HE LIKES TO MOAN ABOUT 
IN FRONT OF THE AFRICANS TO SAY 
LIKE BRITAIN OR THE UNITED STATES 
THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS UN HAS SAID THE CREDIBILITY 
OF THE AN CANS IS AT STAKE ON 
ZIMBABWE MEANWHILE PRESIDENT MBEKI 
WHO HAS BEEN ENTRUSTED BY HIS 
LABOURERS TO SORT THE THING OUT SO 
NOTHING NO MENTION I MEAN THIS 
STRANGE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE 
SECRETARY GENERAL FOR MAKING WHAT I 
THINK IS AN UNPRECEDENTED STRONG 
STATEMENT AND THE PRESIDENT OF 
SOUTH AFRICA SAYING NOTHING IS 
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ANALYSE 
BEYOND WORDS WHERE DID THE UN GO 
THERE IS A LOT OF TALK THAT THIS 
WILL BE LOOKED AT AS PERHAPS A 
THREAT AGAINST WORLD PEACE AND 
STABILITY AND SO ON AND THAT VERY 
SOON TROOPS WILL MARCH THROUGH BULL 
LA WAY YA THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN 
THIS IS NOT THIS KIND OF MEETING 
WHAT IT DOES MEAN IS THAT BRITAIN 
AND THE PRIME MINISTER IN 
PARTICULAR LET'S FACE IT THAT WAS 
A STRONG STATEMENT AS WELL TALKING 
ABOUT BAN KI MOON BUT WE HAVE GOT 
TO SAY THAT BRITAIN HAS BEEN VERY 
RESTRAINED IN THE RUN UP TO THE 
ELECTIONS IN ORDER NOT TO 
PREJUDICE THE CHANCES OF THE 
OPPOSITION BROWN THERE SAID SOME 
STRONG THINGS 
I WONDER HOW THEY 
CAN GET ROBERT MUGABE TO HEAR THAT 
MESSAGE I WAS HEARING THE OTHER 
DAY THAT PRIVATELY THE HEAD OF THE 
AFRICAN UNION WAS SAYING THAT 
ROBERT MUGABE WOULD NOT TAKE HIS 
PHONE CALLS 
HE SPEAKS TO PEOPLE HE 
FEELS LIKE SPEAKING WHEN FEELS 
LIKE DOING IT YOU HAVE GOT TO A 
STAGE NOW WHERE BROWN HAS SAID AND 
WHERE BAN KI MOON HAS IMPLIED THAT 
WE ARE ALREADY IT IS GOOD 
AFRICANS SHOULD LOOK AFTER AFRICAN 
PROBLEMS NOW THEY HAVE BEEN PUT ON 
NOTICE THIS IS AN ISSUE FOR THE 
REST OF THE WORLD AND THE ISSUE IS 
QUITE STAGGERING NOT TO COUNT YOUR 
VOTES WITHIN THE THREE WEEK PERIOD 
TO HAVE THE ARMY ORGANISING GANGS 
OF HOPPED UP DRUNK MILITIA GOING 
AROUND TERROR RISING BRUTALISING 
THE POPULATION ON TOP OF THE WHOLE 
THE USUAL THING IN ZIMBABWE NOT 
HAVING ANYTHING TO EAT AND NOT 
BEING ABLE TO BUY ANY PETROL WHEN 
MR. MBEKI SAYS CRISIS WHAT CRISIS 
YOU HAVE TO STAND BACK AND SAY WHAT 
KIND OF PLANET ARE WE LOOKING AT I 
UNDERSTAND WHY HE IS SAYING THIS 
LET'S FACE IT IT IS NOT FOURTEEN YEARS 
SINCE SOUTH AFRICA EMERGED FROM ITS 
BRUTAL WHITE NOMINATED REGIME A 
LOT OF THOSE MEMORIES A VERY STRONG 
IN THE MINDS OF A NUMBER OF 
AFRICANS WHO MAY WELL IN THE EARLY 
STAGES LIKE TEN YEARS AGO HAD GONE 
ALONG WITH MUGABE SAYING IT IS THE 
WHITES PARTICULARLY THE BRITS WHO 
ARE RUNNING THIS THING BUT TODAY 
I DON'T KNOW YOU CAN'T DO THAT I 
AM GLAD TO SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE A. N. C. HAS ACTUALLY COME OUT 
WITH SOME STRONG LANGUAGE HIMSELF 
TODAY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MBEKI 
REFUSED TO ACCEPT IS THAT ONE OF 
THE GREAT LIBERATIONS MOVEMENTS OF 
AFRICA LIKE ZANU P. F. COULD BE 
UNDERMINED BY A HOME GROWN 
DEMOCRATICALLY CREATED MOVEMENT 
MUST LEAVE IT THERE THANK YOU FOR 
COMING IN IT IS NOT JUST THE 
UNITED NATIONS THAT IS TAKING UP 
GORDON BROWN'S TIME HIS TRIP TO 
NEW YORK IS FOCUSING ON THE GLOBAL 
CREDIT CRUNCH HE IS MEETING WALL 
STREET BANKERS URGING THEM TO COME 
CLEAN WHILST HE IS AWAY THE B. B. C. 
HAS LEARNT MOVES ARE AFOOT TO EASE 
THE BANKING CRISIS JOINING US NOW 
IS OUR ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT 
WHAT IS THIS PLAN DO WE KNOW WHAT 
IT CONSISTS OF THERE HAS BEEN TALK 
IN THE MARKETS FOR SOME DAYS YOU YOU MENTIONED GORDON BROWN THERE IT 
HAS 
EMERGED TWENTY FOUR 
HOURS AFTER GORDON 
BROWN SAW THE HEADS OF LEADING 
BRITISH BANKS AT DOWNING STREET 
WHEN THEY WERE PRESSING THE CASE 
FOR THIS ACTION THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS 
WE UNDERSTAND FOR A LITTLE WHILE 
IT IS NOT JUST A SORT OF PANIC 
RESPONSE IT IS A SIGNIFICANT MOVE 
BY THEM UP UNTIL NOW BECAUSE OF THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH THEY HAVE OFFERED 
CASH TO THE SYSTEM LOANS UP TO 
THREE MONTHS IN EXCHANGE FOR HIGH 
QUALITY COLLATERAL THIS DIFFERENCE 
THIS TIME IS THEY WILL BE 
EFFECTIVELY OFFERING MONEY UP TO A 
YEAR EFFECTIVELY A SWAP IN 
EXCHANGE FOR A HIGH QUALITY 
GOVERNMENT BOND THEY WILL TAKE 
SECURITIES BACK RISKY SKURTS 
LINKED TO THE HOUSING MARKET ON TO 
THE PUBLIC BALANCE SHEET WILL WILL THERE BE AN ISSUE AS TO WHAT THEY 
ARE WORTH IN TODAY'S MARKET ONE 
PROBLEM THEY HAVE IS THEY DON'T 
KNOW HOW TO VALUE THEM BECAUSE THE 
VALUE HAS BEEN FALLING 
THE VALUE 
IS FALLING BECAUSE NO ONE IS 
TRADING THEM IN A SENSE THE 
SECURITIES THE MARKETS ARE UNABLE 
TO BUY OR SELL HAVE BEEN TAKEN ON 
TO THE BALANCE SHEET WHAT OUR 
SOURCES TELL US IS THE BRITISH 
GOVERNMENT WILL AIM TO PROTECT THE 
TAXPAYER AS FAR AS THEY CAN IF YOU 
LIKE WE WILL ONLY WE WILL TAKE ON 
BOARD ONE OF YOUR SECURITIES AND WE 
WILL ONLY OFFER YOU EIGHTY TO NINETY P. WE 
DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE IT WILL 
BE CRUCIAL SEEING THIS DETAIL WHEN 
THIS SCHEME IS UNVEILED NEXT WEEK 
WILL IT DO THE TRICK 
THE FED DID 
SOMETHING A FEW MONTHS AGO IT DID 
NOT DO THE TRICK IN ITSELF THAT 
WILL PROBABLY BE THE CASE THIS TIME 
LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE DAY'S 
OTHER NEWS ON HIS EIGHTY FIRST BIRTHDAY 
POPE BENEDICT HAS CALLED FOR 
PATIENT DIPLOMACY TO RESOLVE 
CONNERY FLICTS IT IS HIS FIRST 
VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES SINCE 
TAKING OVER AS THE HEAD OF THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH HE IS EXPECTED TO 
DISCUSS THE WAR IN IRAQ AND THE U. S. 
POLICY TOWARDS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION 
ISLAIL HAS KILLED PALESTINIANS 
ISRAEL HAS KILLED PALESTINIANS 
THEY TARGETED MILITANTS A 
CAMERAMAN WORKING FOR REUTERS WAS 
KILLED WHEN HIS CAR EXPLODED IN 
CENTRAL GAZA 
CHRISTIE'S ARE KNOWN FOR BUYING ART 
TODAY SOMETHING MORE UNUSUAL HAS 
GONE UNDER THE HAMMER IN PARIS IT 
IS THE SKELETON OF A SIXTY FIVE MILLION 
YEAR OLD DINOSAUR WHICH IS SEVEN 
AND A HALF METRES LONG IT SOLD FOR 
A LITTLE UNDER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PIRACY ON 
THE HIGH SEAS SOUND LIKE A SWASH 
BUCKLING ACT FROM BOOKS IT IS A 
SERIOUS PROBLEM AND ONE THE FRENCH 
AUTHORITIES ARE DETERMINED TO SHOW 
THEY CAN DEAL WITH 
SIX SOMALIS HAVE BEEN FLOWN TO 
TRIAL TRIAL THEY WERE CAPTURED IN THE DESERT 
AFTER THE CREW OF A HIJACKED VESSEL 
WHICH THEY HAD APPARENTLY TAKEN 
HAD BEEN RELEASED 
AS THE SOMALIS SPENT THEIR FIRST 
HOURS IN FRANCE THE YACHT THEY ARE 
ACCUSED OF HIJACKING WAS THE FOCUS 
OF ATTENTION THE FRENCH DEFENCE 
MINISTER SAW HOW THE EFFORT TO FREE 
THE HOSTAGES TOOK PLACE HE 
INSISTED THE CREW'S RELEASE AND THE 
TRANSFER OF THE PIRATES WERE AGREED 
WITH THE FULL AGREEMENT OF THE 
SOMALI AUTHORITIES 
YOU DON'T IMAGINE THAT FRANCE AFTER CAPTURING THE PIER 
RITS WAS GOING TO PIRATES WAS 
GOING TO LEAVE THEM HERE 
THE FIRST 
PICTURES OF THE INTERIOR REVEAL 
LITTLE DAMAGE SCIENTISTS HAVE 
EXAMINED THE SHIP THE SUSPECTS 
WILL BE GIVEN FULL LEGAL RIGHTS TO 
MOUNT A PROPER DEFENCE THE SIX 
ARRESTED IN THE SOMALI DESERT BY 
THE FRENCH MILITARY FACE 
QUESTIONING BY POLICE SPECIALISING 
IN ORGANISED CRIME A SIGN THAT 
FRANCE CONSIDERS THIS GROUP TO HAVE 
CRIMINAL RATHER THAN TERRORIST 
MOTIVES BACK IN FRANCE THE FREED 
CREW MEMBERS HAVE BEEN QUESTIONED 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ONE HAS 
REPORTEDLY SAID HE UNDERSTOOD THE 
PIRATE'S REASONS THAT IS NOT THE 
VIEW OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT 
WHICH WANTS TO DETER OTHERS 
INCIDENTS OF PIRACY IN THE AREA 
HAVE RISEN SHIP OWNERS AND AID 
AGENCIES TRYING TO DELIVER 
HUMANITARIAN SUPPLYS HAVE CALLED ON 
THE GOVERNMENTS AND THE UN TO DO 
MORE TO STOP IT THE FRENCH DEFENCE 
MINISTER CONGRATULATED THE COMMAND 
Y. O. S. WHO TOOK PART IN THE OPERATION 
THE FRENCH COCKERELS HE SAID CROWED 
ALL THE LOUDER THANKS TO THEM 
HOW BAD IS IT WE AWARE THERE HAVE 
BEEN A FEW INCIDENTS OVER THE PAST 
YEARS 
I CANNOT REALLY SPEAK ABOUT YEARS SOMALIA MALI YA MOST OF MY REPORT 
HAS BEEN IN SOUTH EAST ASIA WHICH 
UNTIL THIS YEAR WAS THE NUMBER ONE 
HOT SPOT FOR INTERNATIONAL PIRACY 
THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR IT HAS NOT 
BEEN AS A MATTER OF FACT IT HAS 
BEEN TAKEN OVER BY SOMALIA SOMALIA 
FOLLOWS THE STANDARD SORT OF 
PROFILE OF A PIRACY HOT SPOT IT 
HAS NO FUNCTIONING GOVERNMENT IT 
HAS NOT HAD ONE FOR A LONG TIME 
PIRACY POPS UP WHERE THERE IS A 
SECURITY VACUUM AND BAD ECONOMIC 
CONDITIONS AS WELL AS ACCESS TO 
WEAPONS 
YOU MENTION THE OTHER'RE WEAPONS YASS OF THE WORLD PIRACY WE TEND 
TO THINK OF AS OLD FASHIONED IT IS 
A MODERN INDUSTRY 
IT IS A MODERN 
INDUSTRY BUT LIKE I SAY IT POPS 
UP WHEN THESE CONDITIONS EXIST THE 
THING TO REMEMBER THOUGH IS IT IS 
STILL A SMALL PER CENTAGE OF THE 
GLOBAL TRAFFIC BUT THAT BEING SAID 
SHIPPING TRAFFIC NOW AND THE GLOBAL 
ECONOMY IS SO TIGHT MORE THAN NINETY PER CENT 
OF ALL GOODS SHIPPED IT IS 
SOMETHING OF CONCERN SHIP OWNERS 
CAN NOT ABIDE A LOSS OF A FEW DAYS 
HERE AND THERE IT IS IMPORTANT TO 
REMEMBER THERE ALL PIRACY IS NOT 
THE SAME WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN 
SOMALIA IS HOSTAGE TAKING PIRACY 
THEY ARE TRYING TO RAISE MONEY BY 
TAKING HOSTAGES PIRACY IN OTHER 
PLACES ESPECIALLY IN SOUTH EAST 
ASIA IS ABOUT STEALING THINGS LIKE 
PALM OIL FUEL FOR EXAMPLE AND 
THEN OTHER PLACES IN HARBOUR AREAS 
PIRACY AMOUNTS TO NOT MUCH MORE 
THAN A ROBBERY PIRATES GO ON BOARD 
STEAL COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT AND 
ROB THE CREW OF VALUABLES IT IS 
MANY DIFFERENT THINGS UNDER THIS 
BROAD HEADING 
IS THERE MUCH THE AUTHORITIES CAN 
DO ABOUT THIS 
ATTACKS HAVE DECREASED IN CERTAIN 
AREAS THAT HAS COINCIDED WITH 
INCREASED SECURITY AND A BETTER 
ECONOMIC SITUATION IN SUMATRA 
COUNTING PIRACY ATTACKS IS A TRICKY 
BUSINESS A LOT OF SHIPS DON'T 
REPORT ATTACKS THERE'S A LOT OF 
REASON THAT'S COMPANIES DISSUADE 
THEIR COMPANY TIN FROM REPORTING 
INSURANCE RATES GO UP BAD 
PUBLICITY FOR THE SHIPPING LINE 
OFTEN TIMES A SHIP CAN BE DELAYED 
IN PORT FOR SEVERAL DAYS WHILE THE 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES INVESTIGATE 
SOMETIMES THERE'S CORRUPTION 
INVOLVED THEY'RE IN CAHOOTS WITH 
THE PIRATES THERE'S A LOT OF 
DEBATE ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THE 
PIRATE FIGURES ARE IN TERMS OF HOW 
MANY SHIPS ARE ATTACKED EACH YEAR 
PETER GWIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
NOW TAKING VITAMINS ARE GOOD FOR US 
RIGHT NOT SO IF YOU BELIEVE THE 
LATEST RESEARCH FROM SCIENTISTS IN 
DENMARK THEY SAY THEY COULD BE 
DOWN RIGHT BAD FOR YOU CONFUSED 
LET'S TRY TO GET TO THE BOT AM OF 
IT ALL 
WE LIVE IN A HEALTH OBSESSED WORLD 
BOMBARDED WITH BAFFLING AND OFTEN 
COULD TRADICTORY ADVICE TODAY IT'S 
VITAMINS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE 
MILLIONS OF US TAKE THEM BECAUSE WE 
THINK THEY'RE GOOD FOR US 
SCIENTISTS IN DENMARK SAY TAKING 
SUPPLEMENTS SUCH AS A AND E. COULD 
BE HARMFUL IN LARGE DOSES AND COULD 
LEAD TO PREMATURE DEATH JUST A FEW 
WEEKS AGO THE WORLD CANCER RESEARCH 
FUND SUGGESTED EATING ONE SAUSAGE 
OR THREE RASHERS OF BACON A DAY 
WOULD INCREASE THE RISK OF BOWEL 
CANCER DRAMATICALLY WHILE IN 
OCTOBER LAST YEAR A MAJOR REPORT BY 
THE SAME ORGANISATION STRONGLY 
LINKED RED MEAT TO BOWEL CANCER 
OTHER EXPERTS INSIST THOUGH THAT 
SIRLOIN STEAK GIVES YOU MUCH NEEDED 
SUPPLIES OF IRON AND STKWINK FOR A 
STRONG IMMUNE ZINC FOR A STRONG 
IMMUNE SYSTEM SHOULD WE ENJOY THE 
ODD GLASS OF RED WINE THERE ARE A 
VARIETY OF CONFLICTING STUDIES 
SOME SAYING IT'S GOOD FOR THE HEART 
OTHERS SUGGESTING IT TOO COULD 
INCREASE THE RISK OF BOWEL CANCER 
BY A QUARTER DOT NUMBERS SPEAK FOR 
THEMSELVES FRANCE AND BRITAIN IS 
NEAR IDENTICAL POPULATIONS YET 
TODAY TWENTY THOUSAND FRENCH CITIZENS ARE 
AGED ONE H. U. N. P. L. U. S. AGAINST JUST ELEVEN THOUSAND 
IN BRITAIN DOCTOR MARILYN GLENVILLE IS 
BRITAIN'S LEADING NUTRITIONIST 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS REPORT 
THEN 
IT CAN BE CONFUSING FOR THE THEN CONSUMER THIS PIECE OF RESEARCH 
WAS WHAT WE CALL AS METER ANALYSIS 
IT'S A COMBINATION OF ANALYSIS 
TOGETHER THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHICH 
TRIALS TO LEAVE OUT AND WHICH THEY 
INCLUDE UNFORTUNATELY FOUR HUNDRED FIVE OF THEM 
WERE LEFT OUT WHICH REPORTED NO 
DEATHS AT ALL SO WHEN YOU ARE 
LOOKING AT THE EFFECT OF VITAMINS 
ON MORTALITY DO THEY INCREASE 
DEATHS TO EXCLUDE STUDIES WHERE 
THERE WERE NO DEATHS AT ALL SEEMS 
ILLOGICAL THEY INCLUDED WHAT WE 
CALL ALL MORTALITY RISK OR 
MORTALITY CAUSES IF SOMEBODY DIED 
OF A CAR ACCIDENT THAT WOULD BE 
INCLUDED IN THERE AND WOULD HAVE NO 
CONNECTION TO THE VITAMINS IT 
MAKES IT REALLY CONFUSING FOR THE 
CONSUMER WHAT WITH THE CONFUSING 
MESSAGES ABOUT RED WINE AND MEAT 
AND OTHER THINGS IN THE MEDIA IN 
THE END THEY WON'T KNOW WHAT TO 
BELIEVE 
IT IS CONFUSING EVERY BELIEVE TIME I TURN ON THE RADIO OR OPEN 
THE NEWSPAPER I'M TOLD ONE THING 
THE NEXT DAY I'M TOLD THE OTHER N. 
THE ROUND SHOULD I BE TAKING 
VITAMINS 
I THINK THEY SHOULD FOR VITAMINS MY POINT OF VIEW I THINK THEY 
SHOULD NOT IN PLACE OF A HEALTHY 
DIET THEY ARE SUPPLEMENTS THEY 
ARE SUPPLEMENTARY TO A HEALTHY DIET 
N. MODERATION IN GOOD AMOUNTS THEY 
CAN BE USEFUL IN TERMS OF KEEPING 
US HEALTHY THEY ARE NO REPLACEMENT 
FOR A HEALTHY DIET IT'S IN 
CONJUNCTION WITH IT AND USING THEM 
YES IN GOOD LEVELS ALONG WITH 
EATING WELL GETTING OUR LIFESTYLE 
RIGHT AND OUR EXERCISE SO WE'VE 
GOT A GENERAL EFFECT ON OUR HEALTH 
WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE AIMING FOR YOU YOU GET SO MANY OF THESE STUDIES THESE 
DAYS OFTEN SEEING TWO THREE FOUR 
STORIES IN THE PAPER WOULD IT BE 
BETTER TO HAVE A BIT OF IGNORANCE 
ON THIS ISSUE 
IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE 
IN THE END PEOPLE AREN'T LISTENING 
THEY WILL GET VERY CONFUSED IN THE 
END THEY WON'T KNOW WHAT TO EAT WE 
HAVE AN OBESITY CRISIS IN THE U. K. 
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO GET A 
MESSAGE ACROSS IN THE END PEOPLE 
MAY GLAZE OVER WITH ONE STUDY 
CONTRADICTING ITSELF MAYBE ONE DAY 
AFTER OTHER IN THE END NO MESSAGE 
IS GETTING ACROSS AND PEOPLE ARE 
NOT EATING WELL THEN WE HAVE THIS 
OBESITY AND DIABETIC CRISIS AS WELL 
DOCTOR MARILYN GLENVILLE THANK YOU 
HOW MANY OF YOU OUT THERE HAVE AN 
IDEA FOR A BEST SELL SNER MAYBE 
YOU'VE WRITTEN THE FIRST FEW 
CHAPTERS OR FINISHED A MAN CRYPT 
YOU'LL KNOW COMMITTING YOUR PLOT TO 
PAIP SER PART OF THE BATTLE 
GETTING PUBLISHED CAN BE A HARDER 
TASK NOW THE LONDON BOOK FAIR IS 
OFFERING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR WRITERS 
PUBLISHERS AND DISTRIBUTORS TO GET 
TOGETHER TOGETHER NOVELS BUY YOING FIZ CHILDREN'S 
BOOKS SCIENCE BOOKS COOKERY 
GARDEN EVERYTHING IS HERE IF 
YOU'RE AN ASPIRING WRITER HOW DO 
YOU STAND OUT FROM THE CROWD HOW 
DO YOU GRAB A PUBLISHER'S 
ATTENTION 
I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY DIFFERENT 
WHAT WE'RE ALL LOOKING OUT FOR IS 
SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT THERE'S A 
LOT OF BOOKS BEING WRITTEN A LOT 
OF BOOKS BEING PUBLISHED IT'S 
SEEING ONE THAT HAS A CERTAIN SPARK 
THAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM THE 
REST 
OF COURSE A BIT OF GENUINE REST ABILITY HELPS TOO BUT EVEN THE 
PRIZE WINNERS FOUND IT TOUGH GOING 
AT FIRST A LITTLE SELF BELIEF IT 
SEEMS CAN TAKE YOU A LONG WAY I I THINK THERE IS SUCH A DIRGE OF REAL 
TALENT IN WRITING AND THERE ALWAYS 
WILL BE IF YOU'RE GOOD AT WHAT YOU 
DO AND YOU CAN GET WHAT YOU'VE WRIT 
TON A PUBLISHER IT WILL BE 
PUBLISHED THEY FALL ON STUFF WHICH 
IS REALLY NOT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH IN 
MY OPINION 
BUT SEBASTIEN IS A 
GUARANTEED BEST SELLER WHAT ARE 
HIS TOP TIPS 
MY FIRST TIP IS WRITE 
ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW THE 
PIECE OF ADVICE THE RECEIVED 
WITNESS IS WRITE ABOUT WHAT YOU 
KNOW THAT'S THE WORST ADVICE HFR 
GIVEN IN ANY FIELD OF HUMAN 
ENDEAVOUR STICK AT IT REALLY 
REALLY WORK HARD AND DON'T GIVE UP 
IN MY BOOK OF DREAMS 
NO ONE COULD ACCUSE JOHN WALKER OF 
GIVING UP TOO EASILY 
I'VE COME 
DOWN FROM GLASGOW WITH THE HOPE OF 
SEEING THE PUBLISHERS HERE ABOUT MY 
WRITING THIS IS ONE OF MY BOOKS 
HERE MUSICAL NOVELS I'VE BEEN 
COMING FOR NINE YEARS TO THE BOOK

NINE YEARS YEAH 
HAVE YOU FAIR YEAH BEEN SUCCESSFUL YET

GRAHAM BENDEL BECAME DISILLUSIONED 
WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT FROM THE 
INAUSPICIOUS SURROUNDINGS OF HIS 
LONDON FLAT HE SET UP HIS OWN 
PUBLISHING HOUSE TO GET HIS WORK 
INTO PRINT 
JONATHAN HAD NO REAL 
UNDERSTANDING OF AKRI FIES BUT 
THAT AM KOLZ LATER URIK WAS A HARD 
WORKING TOE THE LINE TYPE HE WAS 
WORKING AS A LITERARY AGENT THEY 
WERE GOING TO FIRE HIM BECAUSE THEY 
WANTED BIG NEW NOVELS AND HE HADN'T 
DELIVERED ANY I DON'T THINK THE 
PUBLISHING WORLD REALLY CARES IF 
THERE'S A DOSTOYEVSKY ROUND THE 
CORNER THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THE 
NEXT SAD CELEBRITY TO SELL BOOKS I 
THINK THEY SHOULD SHOW MORE VISION 
AND MAKE THIS CULTURE A BIT 
BRIGHTER AND MORE VIBRANT AND NOT 
SO CYNICAL 
CYNICAL SURELY NOT THESE DAYS 
EVEN A CHIMPANZEE CAN GET HIS 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY ONTO THE SHELVES I 
SUPPOSE ONE PERSON'S LITERARY GEM 
IS ANOTHER'S CULTURAL BAUBLE EVEN 
THE POWERHOUSES OF PUBLISHING MAKES 
MISTAKES 
I FAMOUSLY TURNED DOWN MISTAKES THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS WHICH WON 
THE BOOKER PRIZE IN MY PREVIOUS JOB 
I'M NOW HER PUBLISHER AT

THANKS TO THE WIND WHICH WILL BE 
COMING OUR WAY FROM THE EAST NOT 
DIRECTLY FROM THE CONTINENT BUT 
MORE SO FROM THE NORTH SEA WHERE 
THE TEMPERATURE AT THE MOMENT IS 
ONLY AROUND SIX CELSIUS THAT COLD 
WATER WILL CHILL THE AIR ABOVE IT

DIRECTLY EXPOSED TO THE NORTH SEA 
IT IS GOING TO FEEL RAW THROUGH THE 
NEXT FEW DAYS QUITE A BIT OF CLOUD 
INTO THE EAST COAST BY TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON AS WELL QUITE A BIT OF 
SUNSHINE THOUGH ACROSS NORTHERN 
SCOTLAND AS WE HEAD FURTHER SOUTH

NORTHUMBERLAND WE COULD GET 
OUTBREAKS OF RAIN AND THAT WIND 
COMING IN DIRECTLY OFF THE SEA 
TEMPERATURES WILL STRUGGLE TO GET

BRIGHTER AROUND EAST ANGLIA AND 
ESSEX BUT STILL FEELING CHILLY

WIND HAS A DISTINCT STRENGTH TO IT 
TEMPERATURES IN DOUBLE FIGURES 
SIMILAR TO TODAY BUT IT FEELS A 
LOT COLDER QUITE A DIFFERENT DAY 
ON THE WAY FOR NORTHERN IRELAND
