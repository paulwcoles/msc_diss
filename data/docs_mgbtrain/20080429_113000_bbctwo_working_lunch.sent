HELLO AND WELCOME TO WORKING LUNCH 
MORE PLEASE ONE OF THE U. K.'S 
BIGGEST BANKS ASKS ITS SHAREHOLDERS 
TO STUMP UP EXTRA CASH WHAT ARE 
THE OPTIONS IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE 
WHOSE BEEN PUT ON THE SPOT BUMPER 
PROFITS FOR B. P. AND SHELL BUT IS 
THAT WHAT REALLY PUMPING UP PRICES 
ON THE FORECOURT ALSO ALL CHANGE 
AT EBAY AS THE ONLINE AUCTION SITE 
PREPARES TO BRING IN NEW RULES FOR 
BUYING AND SELLING AND WHEN THE 
ROVER CAR COMPANY COLLAPSED SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOBS THREE YEARS 
ON I'LL BE FINDING OUT WHAT SOME 
OF THEM DID NEXT HBOS THAT THE 
BANK WHICH BROUGHT TOGETHER HALIFAX 
AND BANK OF SCOTLAND HAS ANNOUNCED 
PLANS FOR A RIGHTS ISSUE IT'S 
GOING TO RAISE FOUR BILLION OF EXTRA 
FUNDING FROM ITS EXISTING 
SHAREHOLDERS THAT'S WHAT THE 
RIGHTS ISSUE IS ALL ABOUT IT'S 
GOING TO AFFECT A LOT OF PEOPLE 
AND MORE THAN MOST BECAUSE THE 
BANK HAS MORE THAN TWO MILLION 
SHAREHOLDERS MANY OF WHOM OWN 
SHARES BECAUSE OF THE HISTORICAL 
SITUATION WHERE HALIFAX WAS 
DEMUTUALISED THEY MAY NOT OWN ANY 
OTHER SHARES THIS WILL BE NEUTRAL 
OF 
OF PEOPLE HBOS ALSO ADDED IT WAS 
WRITING OFF TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION FROM THE 
VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENTS THAT WAS 
LINKED TO U. S. SUB PRIME MORTGAGE 
AND ALSO THE GLOBAL CREDIT CRUNCH 
DESPITE THE WORRIES ABOUT THE BANKS 
THEY HAVE ACTUALLY ESCAPED THE 
WORST OF THE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE 
OVER THE PAST YEAR THE RETAILERS 
HAVE LOST AROUND HERE LARGEST A 
SELECTION OF THEM DIXONS ARE DOWN 
AT THE BOTTOM NEXT TO DOWN FIFTY TWO PER CENT 
ON AVERAGE OVER THE YEAR THE 
RETAILING SECTOR HAS LOST FORTY PER CENT OF 
ITS VALUE HERE IS THE BANKING 
SECTOR OVER THE SAME PERIOD 
ALTHOUGH THERE IS A HUGE VARIATION 
HERE ON AVERAGE THE BANKING SITE 
SECTOR HAS LOST TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF ITS VALUE 
OVER THE PAST YEAR BAD BUT BY NO 
MEANS THE WORST OF THE SECTOR VETS 
HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TODAY 
HBOS SHARES DOWN SEVEN P. IT'S LOST 
VALUE BUT NOT AL HUGE AMOUNT DOWN 
THIS IS GOING TO AFFECT A LOT OF 
PEOPLE PETER STEWART RODE INTO THE 
PROGRAMME HE SAYS HE HAS HBOS 
SHARES IN AN ISA ACCOUNT WHICH ARE 
HELD IN A NOMINEE ACCOUNT AS WELL 
HE ASKS SHOULD HBOS GO FOR A 
RIGHTS ISSUE WHAT CAN I EXPECT TO 
HAPPEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE IN 
THE SITUATION IF YOU HAVE PUT THE 
MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU CAN IN 
YOUR EYES A YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE 
TO PUT ANY NEW MONEY IN YOU WILL 
HAVE REACHED YOUR MAXIMUM WHATEVER 
THE RIGHTS ISSUE IS THAT IS YOUR 
LIMIT A LOT OF PEOPLE ALSO HOLD 
THEIR SHARES IN A NOMINEE ACCOUNT 
THAT'S AN ACCOUNT NOT HELD IN YOUR 
NAME BUT HELD ON YOUR BEHALF HBOS 
SAY YOU WILL BE OFFERED THE RIGHTS 
ISSUE EVEN IN A NOMINEE ACCOUNT 
BRIEFLY I WANT TO GO ON TO ONE 
OTHER QUESTION 
I THINK THIS IS THE DEFINITION OF 
POETIC JUSTICE BECAUSE IF THEY 
THINK IT'S SUCH A GREAT INVESTMENT 
LET THEM LEND YOU THE MONEY TO BUY 
THE SHARES I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU 
IT'S A GREAT IDEA L. DO NOT BELIEVE 
YOU WILL GET AWAY WITH IT NOT FOR 
ONE MINUTE BUT DO TELL ME IF YOU 
DO IT IS A DAY IN WHICH TWO OF OUR 
BIG THEMES HAVE COME BACK TO GRAB 
THE HEADLINES BANKS ARE ONE AND 
THE OTHER IS THE OIL SECTOR THE 
OIL FIRMS SHELL AND B. P. HAVE SEEN 
FIRST QUARTER PROFITS BOOM THANKS 
TO THE RISE IN OIL PRICE OIL IS 
NOW CLOSE TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS A BARREL SHELL 
MADE PROFITS OF THE STERLING 
EQUIVALENT TO THREE POINT NINE BILLION THAT'S 
UP THIRTEEN PER CENT THERE ITS RIVAL B. P. SAW 
ITS FIRST 
THE STERLING EQUIVALENT OF THIRTY THREE ONE 
BILLION B. P. HAVE ALSO ANNOUNCED 
THAT THE FORTIES PIPELINE IS TO RE 
OPEN AFTER THEIR OIL PROCESSING 
PLANT WAS RESTARTED AFTER THE 
STRIKE IN SCOTLAND ENDED THIS 
MORNING THEIR PROFITS HAVE BEEN 
BOOSTED BY THE HUGE RISE IN THE OIL 
PRICE RECENTLY LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED THIS IS BRENT 
CRUDE PRICE TEN DOLLARS THIS TIME LAST 
YEAR WE WERE TALKING AROUND SEVENTY DOLLARS A 
BARREL IT NOW LOOKS WITHIN 
SPITTING DISTANCE OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS IT'S 
AROUND ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN DOLLARS THIS MORNING A LOT OF 
PEOPLE GET CONFUSED ABOUT AL RISE IN 
THE PRICE OF OIL BECAUSE PETROL 
PRICES TO RISE AS QUICKLY AS THE 
OIL PRICE INDEED IT DOESN'T FALL 
AS QUICKLY WHEN THE OIL PRICE FALLS 
THIS IS THE REASON WHY THE AVERAGE 
PRICE OF A LITRE OF PETROL IS ABOUT 
ONE OH NINE P. PER LITRE BUT THE PRICE OF 
THE OIL OF THE PETROL REPRESENTS 
LESS THAN FORTY PER CENT OF BACKSHALL TOTAL 
THE MAJORITY OF THE MONEY YOU PAY 
FOR PETROL GOES IN TAX OVER FIFTY 
PENCE THAT GOES IN FUEL DUTY 
THEN YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER TAX VAT 
AROUND NINETEEN PENCE GOES IN VAT WE 
HAVE ABOUT FORTY P. TO BE DIVIDED UP 
BETWEEN THE PETROL STATION COSTS 
AND THE PROFIT SO THE MAJORITY OF 
THE PRICE OF A LITRE OF PETROL IS 
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PRICE OF OIL 
IT'S ALL TO DO WITH TAX IT'S NOT 
THAT RESPONSIVE TO CHANGES IN THE 
OIL PRICE ITSELF B. P. AND SHELL THE 
COMPANIES TOGETHER ACCOUNT FOR SIXTEEN PER CENT 
OF THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED THEY ARE MASSIVELY 
IMPORTANT COMPANIES SO WHILST 
HIGHER PETROL PRICES OBVIOUSLY 
ENJOY LOTS OF CUSTOMERS A 
PROFITABLE OIL SECTOR IS VERY GOOD 
FOR THE STOCK MARKET INVESTORS AND 
MOST HOLDERS OF A PRIVATE PENSION 
WE SPOKE TO GORDON GRAY HE IS AN 
ANALYST AT J. P. MORGAN WE ASKED HIM 
WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN 
TO THE PRICE OF OIL AND THE SHARE 
PRICE OF THESE TWO COMPANIES 
FIRSTLY 
FIRSTLY 
FIRSTLY DEMAND IS ACTUALLY QUITE 
WEAK IN THE O. E. C. D. IT'S BEEN HOLDING 
UP VERY WELL AND THE NON O. E. C. D. BUT 
THE AMOUNT OF SPARE CAPACITY THAT 
CAN RESPOND TO THAT DEMAND IS VERY 
LIMITED SO THE REACTION TO ANY 
OUTAGE OF PRODUCTION SUCH AS THE 
PAD AND THE NORTH SEA AS A RESULT 
OF THE GRANGEMOUTH STRIKE OR WE 
HAVE HAD FROM THE STRIKE IN NIGERIA 
THIS WEEK IS MAGNIFIED BUT WE DO 
THINK THERE IS A RISK THAT 
FUNDAMENTALS AREN'T SUPPORTING THIS 
PRICE AND WE WILL HAVE A FALL BACK 
WITHIN THE COMING WEEKS ON THE 
COMPANIES THEMSELVES THE RESULTS 
WERE PROBABLY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY PER CENT AHEAD OF 
WHAT THE MARKET WAS LOOKING FOR 
BUT THE ISSUE IS ACTUALLY THE 
UNDERLYING VOLUME GROWTH IN THE 
COME WAS PRETTY WELL SEE ROW YEAR 
ROUND YEAR SO THEY ARE ENTIRELY 
RELIANT ON COMMODITY STRENGTH TO 
DRIVE THESE FIGURES 
WE WILL BE 
LOOKING AT THE REST OF THE STOCK 
MARKET LATER 
TWO ELDERLY UNMARRIED SISTERS WHO 
WERE FIGHTING FOR THE SAME 
INHERITANCE TAX RIGHTS AS MARRIED 
AND SAME SEX COUPLES HAVE LOST 
THEIR COURT CASE JOYCE AND SYBIL 
BURDEN WHO HAVE LIVED TOGETHER ALL 
THEIR LIVES IN THE SAME HOUSE IN 
WILTSHIRE FEARED THAT THEY WILL 
HAVE TO SELL THEIR HOME WHEN ONE OF 
THEM DIES UNLESS THEY ARE GRANTED 
THE SAME RIGHTS ELIZABETH IS FROM 
THE LAW FIRM WHICH HAS REPRESENTED 
THE SISTERS JUST PUT US IN THE 
PICTURE FOR THE EUROPEAN COURT HAS 
SAID TO YOU 
WHAT THE EUROPEAN 
COURT HAS SAID TODAY IS THAT 
ALTHOUGH THE SISTERS HAVE 
DEMONSTRATED A VERY COMMITTED 
RELATIONSHIP OVER A LONG PERIOD OF 
TIME THAT RELATIONSHIP IS NOT THE 
SAME AS A MARRIAGE FOREIGN 
REGISTERED CIVIL PARTNERSHIP AND 
THEREFORE THEY ARE NOT ENTITLED TO 
HAVE THE SAME BENEFITS IN TERMS OF 
INHERITANCE TAX EXEMPTIONS WHAT WHAT HAS BEEN THE REACTION OF THE 
SISTERS HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO 
BREAK THE NEWS TO THEM 
WE HAVE A 
COLLEAGUE OF MINE SPOKE TO THEM 
FIRST THING THIS MORNING WHEN WE 
RECEIVE THE JUDGMENT THEY WERE 
ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED BY THIS THEY 
HAVE BEEN FIGHTING TO CHANGE THE 
LAW FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS NOW THEY HAD 
REALLY HOPED THAT THE EUROPEAN 
COURT WOULD GIVE THEM THE JUSTICE 
WHICH SO FAR HAS BEEN DENIED TO 
THEM AND NOW THE COURT HAS DONE 
THE SAME AS EVERY COURT BEFORE IT 
THEY HAVE HOWEVER VOWED THAT THEY 
WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING AND IT IS 
THEIR CONTINENT INTENTION TO 
CONTINUE LOBBYING PARLIAMENT AND 
THEIR M. P. TO GET HIS CHANGED WHAT WHAT LEGAL AVENUES TO YOU NOW HAVE IN 
TWO THOUSAND SIX THE JUDGMENT WAS BY A FOUR TO THREE 
MAJORITY OF THE JUDGES THIS TIME 
WE HAVE HAD A FIFTEEN TO TWO MAJORITY WHICH 
SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT ALTHOUGH THE 
CODE HAS DESCRIBED THE PLIGHT AS 
AWFUL THAT THERE IS A PRETTY FIRM 
MAJORITY THERE 
THERE IS LEGALLY 
THERE IS NOTHING FURTHER THEY CAN 
DO THE GRAND CHAMBER IS THE 
HIGHEST COURT IN EUROPE SO THERE 
ARE NO FURTHER LEGAL AVENUES THEY 
CAN EXPLORE TO TRY TO CHANGE THIS 
VERDICT THE ONLY THING THAT'S LEFT 
TO THEM IS TO TRY TO PERSUADE HIS 
GOVERNMENT OR ANY SUCCESS OF 
GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE LEGISLATION TO 
INCORPORATE PEOPLE IN THEIR 
SITUATION 
AND THE CHANCES OF THAT SITUATION SEEMED SLIM AT THE MOMENT WHAT 
WITH ALL THE OTHER PRESSURES THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT ON AND TEN P. TAX 
INHERITANCE INHERITANCE WHICH 
WITH SIBLINGS IS LIKELY TO BE LOW 
DOWN ON THEIR AGENDA DO YOU ACCEPT 
THIS AS THE FINISHED NOW 
WE DO 
THERE IS NO OTHER LEGAL AVENUE THEY 
CAN GO THROUGH SO WE HAVE TO 
ACCEPT THIS JUDGMENT AS 
DISAPPOINTING AS IT IS 
LET'S MOVE 
NOW TO JOHN WHITING WHO IS A TAX 
EXPERT WITH PRICE WATERHOUSE COOPERS 
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO BROADEN IT OUT 
HERE JOHN THERE AREN'T THAT MANY 
SIBLINGS WHO LIVE TOGETHER BUT ARE 
THERE ARE WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF 
THIS RULING 
INDEED WHAT WE HAVE 
WITHIN INHERITANCE TAX AS A TAX 
THAT GIVES ADVANTAGES TO BE MARRIED 
OR CIVIL PARTNERS YOU CAN LEAVE 
WHAT YOU LIKE TO YOUR SPOUSE CIVIL 
PARTNER WITH NO INHERITANCE TAX 
THOSE WHO ARE UNMARRIED AS WELL AS 
THE SIBLINGS DON'T GET THAT RIGHT 
IT IS A RIGHT THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN 
AN EXTRA TWIST WITH THE TRANSFEROR 
OF THE NIL RATE BAND WHICH IS 
AVAILABLE BETWEEN SPOUSES IF ONE 
SPOUSE DOESN'T USE IT IT GOES TO 
THE SURVIVING SPOUSE IT'S ALREADY 
BEEN POINTED OUT THAT THIS NEW RULE 
THAT HAS JUST COME IN IN THE LAST 
FEW MONTHS IS A GAIN A BIT OF A 
BIAS AGAINST THE UNMARRIED OR THE 
SISTERS LIKE THE BIRD AND SISTERS 
YOU WORRIED TAX ADVISER BUT DO YOU 
ACCEPT THAT WE HAVE TO DRAW THE 
LINE SOMEWHERE THE NUB OF THIS 
CASE SEEMS TO BE THERE IS NO LEGAL 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THEM WHEREAS GAY 
OR OTHER COUPLES HAVE THAT LEGAL 
AGREEMENT WHICH ALLOWS THEM THEN TO 
GET THE INHERITANCE BENEFIT THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT ALTHOUGH EVERY SYMPATHY WITH 
THE SISTERS THERE IS FUNDAMENTALLY 
COMING DOWN FROM THE COURTS AND IN 
THE LAW ALREADY THIS THING THAT 
SAYS WRIGHT MARRIAGE DOES HAVE A 
PARTICULAR STATUS AND THE COURTS 
ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU CAN GIVE 
THAT SPECIAL STATUS TO MARRIAGE AND 
THEREFORE CERTAIN TAX DIFFERENCES 
LET'S CALL IT DIFFERENCES BECAUSE 
THEY ARE NOT ALL ADVANTAGES THERE 
IS A C. G. T. TWEAK THAT MIGHT GIVE A 
DISADVANTAGE BUT IN GENERAL FOR 
INHERITANCE TAX AND CAPITAL GAINS 
TAX THERE ARE ADVANTAGES TO MARRY 
KNOWING WHAT YOU KNOW NOW BOTH 
ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S STANCE ON 
THIS BECAUSE WE HAD PRE BUDGET 
REVIEW ON THIS AND IT HAS APPEARED 
IN THE BUDGET AND THE RULING BY 
THE EUROPEAN COURT IS THERE 
ANYTHING THAT SIBLINGS CAN DO TO 
PERHAPS BEFORE WE'D THE UTCOME 
THAT THESE SISTERS LOOK THAT 
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SUFFER 
FROM 
IT IS A BIT OF A PLANNING FROM ISSUE AND INHERITANCE TAX IS A TAX 
THAT YOU CAN PLAN FOR EITHER BY 
GIVING THINGS AWAY DURING LIFE BUT 
THE PROBLEM MAY WELL BE IF YOUR 
MAIN ASSET IS YOUR HOUSE IT'S VERY 
DIFFICULT TO GIVE THAT AWAY YOU 
CAN'T GIVE IT AWAY AND CONTINUED TO 
LIVE IN IT THE SORT OF SITUATION 
THE SISTERS FIND THEMSELVES IN 
WHERE IF ONE DIES THEN THE OTHER 
MAY IN EFFECT HAVE AN INHERITANCE 
TAX BILL TO PLAY TO CONTINUE TO 
LIVE IN THAT HOUSE THAT'S A VERY 
HARD MESSAGE FOR SISTERS OR 
UNMARRIED COUPLES PERHAPS IT'S 
SOMETHING TO LOOK UP WITH INSURANCE 
PARTICULARLY AGAINST THE UNEXPECTED 
DEATH CAN YOU AT LEAST TAKE OUT 
SOME INSURANCE TO PROVIDE AGAINST 
THE BILL IT IS A SITUATION THAT 
DESERVES A BIT OF THOUGHT AND 
PLANNING IN ADVANCE TO STOP THE 
UNEXPECTED DISASTER HAPPENING THE THE ONLINE AUCTION SITE EBAY IS 
CHANGING THE WAY BUYERS AND SELLERS 
CAN RATE EACH OTHER THAT HAPPENS 
FROM MAY THESE ARE THE LATEST IN A 
SERIES OF CHANGES TO THE WAY IT 
WORKS WE WILL GET TO THOSE IN A 
MOMENT FIRST RACHEL TAKES A LOOK 
AT THE SIDE THAT HAS GROWN IN 
POPULARITY EBAY SELLS ITSELF AS A 
GLOBAL ONLINE MARKETPLACE WITH 
MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION CUSTOMERS IT 
WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND LAUNCHED IN 
THE U. K. IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE SPARKING A WHOLE 
NEW WORLD OF RETAIL GIVING 
INDIVIDUALS THE CHANCE TO BUY AND 
SELL ONLINE WITH ACCESS TO PRODUCTS 
AND CUSTOMERS THE HIGH STREET COULD 
ONLY DREAM OF IN THE U. K. THERE ARE 
MORE THAN FOURTEEN MILLION ACTIVE USERS 
ALTHOUGH MANY USE THE SITE TO 
SIMPLY SELL OFF UNWANTED ITEMS OR 
BIGGER PRESENCE EBAY ESTIMATE THAT 
ALMOST ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE RUN A 
BUSINESS OR USE E. DAY AS THEIR 
PRIMARY OR SECONDARY SOURCE OF 
INCOME E. DAY 
I'VE BEEN 
PUBLISHING INFORMATION ON US FOR 
RESEARCHING FAMILY HISTORY FOR 
SEVERAL YEARS I'VE BEEN USING EBAY 
MORE RECENTLY AS A MAJOR PROPORTION 
OF MY BUSINESS IT IS IMPORTANT 
THAT IT IS A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD 
FOR EVERYBODY USING THE SITE 
UNFORTUNATELY AND NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
HAVE CAUSED E. DAY TO CHANGE THE 
RULES AND REGULATIONS 
WHEN YOUR 
MAIN SOURCE OF INCOME COMES FROM 
USING THE SIDE ANY CHANGES TO 
RULES AND REGULATIONS CAN HAVE A 
MAJOR IMPACT AND IN A FORUM WHERE 
BUYERS AND SELLERS RARELY NEED 
FACE TO FACE CHANGES TO THE 
FEEDBACK SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR CAN 
RAISE SERIOUS CONCERNS 
WHAT HAVE THESE CHANGES 
IT IS THE 
CHANGES TO THE FEET 
BACS SYSTEM 
WHICH SHOULD BE COMING INTO EFFECT 
IN MAY FEEDBACK YOU HAVE NEW SURNAME 
YOU 
IF YOU 
HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF 
FISH AND 
A SHARK THESE 
FISH IS 
BUYER AND THE SHARK 
IS THE 
SELLER 
IF THE 
FISH 
IS BUYING 
A GOLDFISH 
BOWL FROM THE SHARK IF THE 
GOLDFISH BOWL A RISE IN BE 
CONDITIONS 
AND THE 
SCHALKE 
PAYS UP 
ON TIME 
BOTH MAKING EACH OTHER 
ON TIME BOTH MAKING EACH OTHER GOOD RATINGS SCHALKE PAYS UP 
BUYERS AND SELLERS HAVE RATINGS IF 
THE FISHBOWL HAD ARRIVED CRACKED OR 
IT HAD NOT BEEN PAID FOR ON TIME 
THEY COULD PUT IN A WEST WAITING 
BUYERS CAN STILL MAKE SELLERS BUT 
SELLERS ARE ONLY GOING TO BE ABLE 
TO BREAK 
PIRES AS 
POSITIVE 
OR NOT 
AT ALL 
WHY MAKE THE CHANGE RATE 
BUYERS SOME SELLERS ARE 
INTIMIDATING BUYERS 
IF OUR FISH 
HAD RECEIVED A CRACKED GOLDFISH 
BOWL AND 
SAID I 
AM GOING 
TO WAIT 
TOO NEGATIVELY THE 
SHARK COULD 
HAVE SAID I 
NEGATIVELY 
IT SOUNDS 
LIKE A 
LOT OF 
THESE PEOPLE 
HAVE NOT HAVE 
PLAYGROUND VERY 
RECENTLY THAT 
PLAYGROUND VERY RECENTLY THAT IT IS GOOD NEWS FOR 
BUYERS BUT 
ABOUT 
SELES'S HE 
WANT 
TO WARN 
PEOPLE ABOUT BAD 
BUYERS WHO 
ARE NOT 
PAYING ON TIME SAYS WHO WANT 
CELLARS 
THE THEY ARE NOT GOING CELLARS BE ABLE TO WARN OTHER THE WAY THEY ARE AT THE 
MOMENT

THEY ARE NOT I SPOKE TO ONE OF OUR VIEWERS 
SHE IS 
CONCERNED 
THAT IF 
SHE REPORTS 
BUYER TO EBAY THAT PERSON

SIDE 
STEWART 
SAYS HE 
HAS BEEN 
A VICTIM 
OF THIS INTIMIDATION 
AND SAYS 
IT IS 
GOOD THEY ARE EBAY IS CHANGING THE 
SYSTEM SITE IF A BAD BUYER BUT 
MALICIOUS 
FEEDBACK ON 
A SITE 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE 
BEEN REPORTED 
BY 
THAT CELLAR EBAY WILL REMOVE THE 
MALICIOUS FEEDBACK 
THAT IS 
MALICIOUS FEEDBACK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS CHANGING IF BUYER 
REPEATEDLY DOES 
NOT 
PAY UP 
TIME 
THEY WILL 
BLOCK THEM FROM 
USING 
THE EBAY ALTOGETHER 
IF 
USING THE EBAY ALTOGETHER IF YOU CANNOT PUT 
NEGATIVE FEEDBACK 
CAN REPORT 
THEM TO 
EBAY AND 
THEY 
WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT YOU

COME ABOUT NEXT MONTH AT 
NINE A M. WE 
WERE TOLD 
IT WOULD BEAT THE 
WEEK IN 
MAY AND 
BEFORE WE CAME 
END 
WE WERE 
TOLD IT WOULD BE LATE 
MAY THESE CHANGES RELATE BUSINESS 
SELLERS WAS 
THAT THEY 
HAVE TO 
DISPLAY THEIR ADDRESS ON

EVERYBODY IN LINE
