TODAY WE'RE IN RURAL DERBYSHIRE 
TO HELP A COUPLE WITH A VERY UNUSUAL PROPERTY PROBLEM

DAUGHTER AMANDEEP WHO'S JUST GOT MARRIED

MANJEET WORKS IN A PHARMACY 
AND RASHPAL'S AN ACCOUNTANT WHO COMMUTES TO LEICESTER 
RASHPAL AND GRANDFATHER SOHAN ARE KEEN FOOTBALL FANS AND GREAT BOLLYWOOD FILM ENTHUSIASTS 
THEY'VE TAKEN OVER THE DOWNSTAIRS 
FORCING MANJEET UPSTAIRS IN THE EVENINGS 
SO SHE'S EXPECTING US TO COME IN

RASHPAL MANJEET TO BE BLUNT ABOUT THIS 
YOU'VE GOT THIS GORGEOUS HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF DERBY 
WHY ARE WE MOVING 
IT IS VERY NICE 
WE'VE BEEN VERY HAPPY HERE 
BUT WE'VE BEEN HER FOR NINE YEARS AND BOTH OUR CHILDREN ARE GROWN UP 
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS AN EXTRA SITTING ROOM FOR MYSELF 
ALTHOUGH THIS IS A FIVE BEDROOM HOUSE THERE'S NO SPACE FOR ME 
AND RASHPAL AND MY FATHER IN LAW AND PAV 
THEY'RE ALL INTO THEIR BOLLYWOOD FILMS AND FOOTY 
I GET THROWN INTO THE KITCHEN OR AS A TEENAGER INTO MY BEDROOM 
THEY'RE NOT SHORT BOLLYWOOD FILMS ARE THEY NO 
SO WHEN THE FAMILY COME ROUND 
I'M ALWAYS UPSTAIRS AND THEY CONSTANTLY THINK I'M ASLEEP 
ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE WHAT ABOUT THE GARDEN

RIGHT YEAH O. K. 
AND WHEREABOUTS ARE WE LOOKING 
ANYWHERE SORT OF SOUTH OF DERBY 
ANY REASONS WHY YOU'RE STICKING TO THIS AREA

ALL DANCING FINALE I CAN FEEL IT 
I'M GOING TO CHAT TO AN ESTATE AGENT 
I'M GOING TO MAKE AN EPIC PERFORMANCE ELSEWHERE 
DERBYSHIRE FORMS PART OF THE BACKBONE OF ENGLAND 
IT CONTAINS SOME OF THE FINEST SCENERY 
AND WILDEST LANDSCAPES IN THE COUNTRY 
SOUTH DERBYSHIRE IS UNDENIABLY VERY ATTRACTIVE 
WITH LOTS OF IDYLLIC VILLAGES DOTTED AROUND UNSPOILT COUNTRYSIDE 
IT'S UTTER BLISS 
FOUR BEDROOM DETACHED HOUSES GO FOR BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND AND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
KRISTIAN YOU HAVE A REASONABLE CHANCE OF FINDING A SUITABLE HOUSE 
WITHIN THIS BUDGET OF UP TO FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
I LIKE A GOOD CHALLENGE 
NOW THIS NECK OF THE WOODS IS A HAVEN FOR COMMUTERS 
IT'S CLOSE TO THE MOTORWAY SO RASHPAL COULD GET TO WORK 
IN LEICESTER IN NO TIME AND IT'S ALSO CLOSE TO EAST MIDLANDS AIRPORT 
PROVIDING LINKS TO THE REST OF THE GLOBE 
LET'S SEE WHAT MANJEET AND RASHPAL COULD GET FOR THEIR MONEY ON OUR ISLAND 
LET'S KICK OF WITH THIS THREE BEDROOM PROPERTY IN GUESTWICK 
IT'S GOT A TWO BEDROOM ANNEXE WITH ITS OWN LOUNGE 
AND THREE ACRE MEADOW 
WHAT MORE COULD MANJEET AND RASHPAL WANT 
AND IT'S A SNIP AT THREE HUNDRED NINETY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
OR THEY COULD HEAD FOR PAIGNTON IN DEVON 
THIS FIVE BEDROOM DETACHED HOME 
COMES WITH AN ANNEX AND STUNNING SEA VIEWS 
FROM THE ALFRESCO DECK VERANDA FOR THE GRAND SUM OF THREE HUNDRED NINETY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
I DO LOVE DEVON 
THEY COULD GO MODERN WITH THIS UNIQUE NEWLY BUILT FOUR BEDROOM PROPERTY NEAR PRESTON 
WITH ENOUGH DOWNSTAIRS ROOM FOR MANJEET RASHPAL AND SOHAN 
AND ALL FOR THREE HUNDRED NINETY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
EXCELLENT PROPERTIES BUT LET'S SEE WHAT I CAN FIND IN THIS LOVELY PART OF THE COUNTRY

AH HERE'S TWO AND NOT TOO FAR APART EITHER 
OH PLEASE HELP ME LOVELY ESTATE AGENT I'M A LOST SOUL 
I'M LOOKING FOR A GORGEOUS PROPERTY 
IT WANTS TO BE KIND OF IDYLLIC TRADITIONAL IN A RURAL SETTING 
FOUR BEDROOMS AND A VERY MATURE GARDEN 
LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT WE'VE GOT 
AND I HAVE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND TO SPEND 
QUITE A TALL ORDER THEN 
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT 
I'VE HAD A TIP FROM AN AGENT ABOUT A PROPERTY SOMEWHERE NEAR HERE 
BUT MY SENSE OF DIRECTION NEVER HAS BEEN GOOD 
THAT'S A NICE PROPERTY LOCAL 
I DON'T WANT TO BE FUNNY BUT I FOLLOWED YOUR DIRECTIONS 
TO THE LETTER AND I'M DEFINITELY NOT ON A HOUSING ESTATE 
IT DOES NEED QUITE A BIT OF WORK DOING TO IT OUT 
GO ROUND THE NEXT BEND AND THEN IS THAT NEAR THE CHURCH 
LOVELY ONE HERE

I LOVE IT TOTALLY 
WE'VE FOUND A SELECTION OF STUNNING PROPERTIES 
THE ONE I AM BACKING IS THIS GORGEOUS HOUSE 
REALLY LARGE AND OF THE ART DECO PERIOD WHICH IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PERIODS 
SO THAT IS THE ONE I LOVE 
FOR MY CHOICE I HAVE COMPROMISED ON THE SPACE IN THIS HOUSE A BIT 
BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS COULD BE MY FAVOURITE PROPERTY I'VE PICKED FOR TO BUY SO FAR 
ARE YOU SERIOUS I AM 
JUST YOU WAIT AND SEE IT'S A RARE THING TO SEE HIM SERIOUS 
ON OUR WILD CARD YOU'RE NOT WON'T TAKE US SERIOUSLY NOW BECAUSE IT'S VERY WILD 
IT'S NOT A LARGE DETACHED PROPERTY AT ALL IN TERMS OF A NORMAL HOUSE 
BUT YOU WILL SEE THAT IT'S ON THE LEVEL 
IT'S NOT WHAT THEY ASKED FOR BUT WE DON'T CARE COS WE LIKE IT 
WE'VE GOT OUR THREE PROPERTIES 
TIME TO COMMENCE THE VIEWINGS AT PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
THIS ONE IS GOING TO GET THEM SINGING AND DANCING WITH JOY 
A FOUR BEDROOM DETACHED PERIOD HOUSE FULL OF CHARACTER 
AND IT'S LOCATED IN MELBOURNE 
YES DERBYSHIRE NOT BAD AT ALL KRISTIAN 
NEAR TO THE SHOPS 
AND A SHORT WALK TAKES YOU RIGHT INTO OPEN COUNTRYSIDE 
RIGHT CHAPS 
HERE WE ARE AT PROPERTY NUMBER ONE AND THIS IS MY CHOICE 
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS A GORGEOUS PROPERTY 
IT WAS BUILT IN THE DAWN OF THE ART DECO AGE 
SO SOME LOVELY ORIGINAL FEATURES IN THERE 
KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY 
THIS IS GOING TO REMEDY YOUR SPATIAL PROBLEMS 
OF WHICH WE ARE EXPERIENCING 
SO WE HAVE THREE RECEPTION ROOMS 
NO ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHICH IS GOING TO BE THE BOLLYWOOD LOUNGE ANY MORE 
IT'S ALL HAPPENING YOU'VE ALSO GOT A LARGE KITCHEN AND A NICE SIZE GARDEN 
WHAT ARE YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
LOOKS QUITE A SUBSTANTIAL PROPERTY 
GOOD WORD YES WHAT DOES MADAM THINK 
IT'S O. K. WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S O. K. WE'LL SEE 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S O. K. 
I NEVER LIKE HIS TASTE BUT THIS IS A LOVELY DECO PROPERTY 
WE'LL SEE WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE'LL SEE O. K. 
I IMAGINE IT'S VERY NICE INSIDE 
WE'LL WAIT AND SEE WE'RE NOT SURE ABOUT THE SURROUNDINGS THE AREA 
YEAH YOU DID SAY RURAL DIDN'T YOU KRISTIAN 
I'M SICK OF YOU GO INSIDE THAT HOUSE AND FALL IN LOVE WITH IT 
OFF YOU GO 
AND I'M GOING TO CATCH ONE OF THOSE FLIGHTS TO MALAGA 
O. K. FELLA IT'S ALL HANDS ON DECO 
HOW VERY MODERN OF YOU 
NOTICE THE DOOR NUMBER YEAH FORTY FOUR SAME AS OURS 
YOU NEVER KNOW IT MIGHT BE A GOOD OMEN 
DO YOU KNOW I LIVED IN A PROPERTY THAT HAD THE NUMBER FORTY FOUR AS WELL 
DID YOU ISN'T THAT A COINKY DINK 
DO YOU KNOW IT'S INCREDIBLE 
I LIVED IN A PROPERTY THAT HAD THE NUMBER THIRTY EIGHT 
THAT BEARS NO RELEVANCE TO OUR CONVERSATION 
YOU'RE NOT INCLUDED IT'S JUST US 
QUITE SPACIOUS 
QUITE LARGE ISN'T IT AND THE FIREPLACE M. M. M. 
IT'S NOT TOO BAD 
BIGGER THAN OUR OWN 
GOOD BIGGER THAN OURS 
I LIKE THE CEILING DEFINITELY 
AND THE WINDOWS DEFINITELY THE WINDOWS 
IT'S VERY AIRY 
BUT IT'S THE VIEW YOU COULD EASILY SORT OF REARRANGE 
AND CHANGE AND PUT YOUR OWN LITTLE DETAILS IN HERE 
I WOULDN'T CHANGE TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT ROOM I LIKE IT 
IT'S FABULOUS 
ANOTHER BIG ROOM 
IT'S LIKE A DINING SLASH MUSIC ROOM REALLY AT THE MOMENT ISN'T IT 
DOES THE ROOM HIT THE RIGHT NOTE THAT'S THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTOR 
I'M NOT QUITE SURE 
THAT WOULD BE THE BOLLYWOOD LOUNGE 
THE FIRST RECEPTION WOULD BE HER LOUNGE 
AND THEY HAVEN'T FOUND THIS ONE BACK HERE THE FOOTBALL VIEWING AREA 
AND DINING SPACE 
I DO LIKE THIS ROOM 
THIS ONE IS THE BEST ROOM I'VE LIKED 
YOU CAN EVEN PUT A DINING TABLE IN HERE IF YOU WANTED TO 
WE'D PROBABLY USE THIS AS THE DINING ROOM SITTING ROOM 
WHAT ABOUT ME IF THIS IS MY ROOM AGAIN 
THEN YOU GUYS ARE IN HERE AGAIN AREN'T YOU NO NO 
THE BOYS ARE BEING PUSHED AWAY 
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF ROOMS TO WORK WITH THERE'S THREE 
YEAH THAT IS GOOD 
WHAT YOU'VE DONE HERE IS GIVEN THEM SO MANY CHOICES 
THAT THEY'RE SPOILT FOR CHOICE NOW 
OH THE KITCHEN'S BIG AS WELL 
IT LOOKS QUITE A NEW FITTED KITCHEN ACTUALLY 
OH YEAH I LIKE THIS 
THAT KITCHEN IS SO LARGE YOU COULD THROW A FEW BOLLYWOOD MOVES IN IT 
I CAN HAVE LIKE THREE DAL SABJIA GOING ON HERE 
YEAH CHAPATTI ON THIS SIDE GOING 
I THINK SHE'S EXCITED ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE COOKING FACILITIES 
THAT WOULD BE MY ROOM DEFINITELY MY ROOM IF IT WAS GOING TO BE 
O. K. YOU COULD HAVE THAT ONE THEN 
MANJEET HAS GOT HER CHILL OUT ROOM 
THE GARDEN IS SMALL 
EVEN IN THIS WEATHER IT'S BIG ENOUGH FOR A MONSOON WEDDING

I WONDER IF THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
I MEAN IF YOU NOTICED THE WARDROBES YEAH 
WE'VE GOT FITTED CAN YOU IMAGINE ME PUTTING ALL MY CLOTHES IN THERE

KRISTIAN 
IS SHE CURSING ME OR LOVING ME 
I'M NOT SURE ER SHE'S CURSING YOU AH 
IT'S BRIGHT AND YELLOW

THAT'S THE GUEST BATHROOM I'VE GIVEN THEM MORE 
NICE SIZE ROOM AGAIN 
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY DO MUCH FOR ME I DON'T KNOW WHY 
I WAS IMPRESSED WHEN I LOOKED UPSTAIRS 
ABOUT ALL THE LIGHT AND SPACE ON THE LANDING 
THERE'S ENOUGH ROOM TO BANG OUT A BHANGRA 
ALL WE HEAR FROM HER IS MISERABILISM 
YEAH THE VIEW'S NOT GREAT NOT GREAT 
IF SHE'S STUCK ON THAT VIEW 
WE COULD BUY A GREAT BIG BILLBOARD 
PAINT A LOVELY RURAL VISTA ON IT AND THEN POP IT OUTSIDE THAT WINDOW 
THIS IS A BIT BIGGER OH 
THIS IS A BETTER BATHROOM ISN'T IT 
GOSH YES A BIT MORE MODERN THAT MAKES ME A LITTLE BIT HAPPIER 
CAN SHE SEE HERSELF WITH HER LITTLE TEA LIGHT CANDLES IN THERE NOW

YES I LOVE SIMON 
AREN'T YOU THE GOLDEN BOY TODAY 
I'M NOT TO SURE ABOUT THE BATHROOM THAT WOULD NEED MODERNISING

JIGGERY POKERY IN THE BATHROOM YEAH IT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN GET MY EARS CLEAN 
THIS ONE'S A BIT MORE MODERN 
I DON'T KNOW MODERN I WOULDN'T SAY MODERN THE DECOR 
NO RASHPAL IT ISN'T MODERN 
SHE'S VERY COMPETITIVE 
THIS IS NICE NOW I WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT TO THIS ROOM 
IT'S QUITE INTERESTING WITH THE KIND OF THE LILAC AND THE PURPLE KIND OF STRIPES ON THE BEDROOM WALL YEAH 
APPARENTLY IT'S QUITE IN THIS SEASON 
WELL WHAT DO THEY SAY THE WHOLE THING WAS A BIT DATED UPSTAIRS 
I LIKE THE NARROW LITTLE HALLWAY 
YOU'VE PICKED A ROOM THAT RESEMBLES YOUR MENTALITY NARROW MINDED 
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT 
I PICKED THIS HOUSE BECAUSE IT REMINDED ME OF YOU 
LONG AND SKINNY LONG AND THIN 
OH THIS IS GOOD FOR YOU WILL MAKE A GOOD STUDY OH WOW YEAH THAT'LL SORT ME OUT 
THEY LOVE IT LET'S REMIND THEM THEY FORGOT ABOUT ANOTHER RECEPTION ROOM AND POOR OLD DAD YES 
RASHPAL I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE UNEXPLORED ATTIC THAT YOU DIDN'T SEE RIGHT 
WHICH IS QUITE INTERESTING LET'S HAVE A LOOK YEAH 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT IT'S QUITE A LOT OF SPACE YEAH 
I THINK YOU'RE THE SENSIBLE ONE IN THIS RELATIONSHIP YEAH YEAH 
MANJEET BULLIES YOU A LITTLE BIT SO IF SHE PICKS ON YOU YEAH WHY CAN'T SHE HANG OUT HERE

WE KNOW THE GARDEN IS BEAUTIFUL YEAH BUT YOU CAN SEE THE FIELDS OVER THERE I KNOW 
I'VE GIVEN YOU COUNTRYSIDE BUT THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO SHOW YOU ONLY A SMALL TASTE COME ON 
THIS IS WHERE THINGS BECOME INTERESTING IN TERMS OF BATHROOMS 
THIS IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS A JACK AND JILL BATHROOM BECAUSE YOU CAN COME INTO IT HERE 
OR YOU CAN COME INTO THE SPACE HERE IF YOU WANT TO GET TO THAT END OF THE HOUSE OR THAT END OF THE HOUSE 
AND SOMEBODY'S USING THE BATHROOM YOUR CONVENIENCE 
BECOMES AN INCONVENIENCE BECAUSE BOTH DOORS WILL BE LOCKED YEAH 
WHICH IS ODD BECAUSE JUST HERE YOU HAVE ANOTHER BATHROOM ANOTHER BATHROOM YEAH 
I WOULD SACRIFICE TWO BATHROOMS FOR ONE GOOD SIZED ONE SO WHY NOT BRING THAT WALL OUT TO ABOUT HERE 
YOU CAN STILL GET ACCESS THROUGH HERE 
YEAH AND MAKE THAT SPACE THERE ONE LARGE BATHROOM 
YEAH A GOOD IDEA NO LONGER WOULD IT BE AN INCONVENIENCE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM

ANOTHER OUTBUILDING THAT COMES WITH THE PROPERTY STEP IN BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT I CALL POTENTIAL 
THIS IS A MASSIVE SPACE O. K. AT THE MOMENT IT'S A GARAGE 
BUT YOU DON'T NEED IT BECAUSE THERE'S PARKING OUT FRONT I AGREE THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL 
TO BE ONE OF TWO THINGS 
A SELF CONTAINED FLAT FOR YOUR FATHER OR YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR CHILL OUT PAD YEAH 
SO I'LL JUST SHOW YOU WHAT'S THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT ARCH OH RIGHT YES 
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER THINK COME ON O. K.

AT LAST WE AGREE ON SOMETHING KRISTIAN AS USUAL 
OUR TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY SURVEYOR GAVE THE TEST DRIVE PROPERTY A THOROUGH ONCE OVER 
IT'S NOT LEGALLY BINDING AND WE'D RECOMMEND YOU GET A FULL SURVEY UNDERTAKEN BEFORE MAKING AN OFFER 
ON ANY KIND OF PROPERTY 
OUR HAWK EYED SURVEYOR NOTED THAT THE BLOCK PAVING IN THE DRIVEWAY HAS BEEN INVADED BY 
MOSS BUT DON'T WORRY IT'S EASILY CLEANED UP WITH A POWER WASHER 
SIMON IT IT GETS EVEN WORSE THAN THAT BECAUSE HE'S ALSO DISCOVERED 
THE CONIFER HEDGES ARE GROWING SO THEY REQUIRE A BIT OF MAINTENANCE WHY DO WE PAY THIS MAN 
THIS IS MANJEET'S MUM SHE'S STANDING IN FOR SOHAN RASHPAL'S DAD

OH HE'S JUST A PEASANT WITH A BIT PART NOW THE ONE WITH THE MOUSTACHE HE'S GOT WHAT IT TAKES

O'BRIEN DEMONSTRATING SILKY SKILLS THERE OH DISPOSSESSED BY DIGBY 
SNEAKY FOOTWORK THE FLICK ON WITH DIGBY CRUNCHING TACKLE THAT'S A NASTY FOUL 
HE'S NOT GOING TO GET UP FROM THAT ONE 
OH HE'S OVERACTING AS USUAL 
THE CROWD'S HUNGRY FOR A GOAL 
AND THERE IT IS 
THE CROWD'S GONE WILD THIS HAS TO BE THE GOAL OF THE CENTURY 
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT AND THE SHIRT'S UP 
HE'S NO DAVID BECKHAM IS HE 
THE MEN ARE HAPPY BUT WHAT ABOUT MANJEET WHO'S CHATTING TO HER DAUGHTER I AM SO HAPPY 
THAT I'VE GOT THIS CHILL OUT ROOM

CHEERS NOW TAKE CARE 
DO YOU KNOW MR. DIGBY I THOUGHT WE WERE BEING PARTICULARLY OUTRAGEOUS WITH THIS CHOICE OF WILD CARD
