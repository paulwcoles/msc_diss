GOOD EVENING THE COMING WEEKEND OFFERS A REAL MISHMASH OF WEATHER 
AND I CAN SEE THAT I HAVE GONE WITH THE MOST OPTIMISTIC HEADLINE 
THAT I COULD POSSIBLY HAVE CHOSEN TO DESCRIBE SATURDAY 
FEELING WARM AND WITH SOME SUNSHINE 
BUT THE BIG PICTURE ALSO TELLS YOU THE OTHER HALF OF THE STORY 
LOW PRESSURE CLOSE BY SO TOO ITS ATTENDANT FRONT 
DRAPING THICK CLOUD ACROSS NORTHERN AND WESTERN PARTS OF BRITAIN 
AND NOT SURPRISINGLY THERE WILL BE A FAIR AMOUNT OF RAIN 
AND SOME EXTENSIVE HILL FOG TOO 
ON WHAT WILL BE A MILD NIGHT WITH WINDS COMING IN FROM THE SOUTH WEST 
WHEREVER YOU'RE SPENDING THE NIGHT TEMPERATURE OF EIGHT TO TWELVE SHOULD COVER IT 
WE START OFF THE NEW DAY SOME BRIGHTNESS FOR THE EAST OF WALES 
NOT SO OUT TOWARDS THE NORTH AND WEST 
A WET START TO THE DAY IF A MILD ONE AS WE GET ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND 
FOR NORTHERN AND WESTERN SCOTLAND TOO A PRETTY WET START TO THE DAY 
ALTHOUGH THERE WILL BE TWELVE DEGREES TO GREET YOU IN GLASGOW 
THE FURTHER TO THE NORTH AND EAST THE MORE LIKELY IT IS 
THAT YOU'LL SEE SOME BRIGHTNESS 
THE DRIEST WEATHER OUT TOWARDS THE EAST OF THE PENNINES 
AS WE COME INTO THE MIDLANDS LINCOLNSHIRE 
EAST ANGLIA AND THE SOUTH EAST WE START OFF THE DAY AT TWELVE OR THIRTEEN DEGREES 
A SIMILAR SORT OF PROSPECT ACROSS THE SOUTH COAST 
NOT QUITE WALL TO WALL SUNSHINE 
AND THAT'LL CERTAINLY BE THE WAY OF IT AS WE GET TO THE SOUTH WEST 
BUT A REALLY DECENT START TO THE DAY 
AS WE GET THROUGH THE DAY YOU'LL SEE THERE IS SLOW MOVEMENT 
OF THIS WEATHER FRONT PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTH 
GETTING FURTHER TOWARDS THE SOUTH AND EAST ACROSS SCOTLAND 
AND GETTING ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND TOO SO WE WILL SEE SOME BRIGHTNESS 
BUT NOWHERE NEAR THE EXTENT OF THE WARMTH OR BRIGHTNESS ACROSS 
THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND THE MIDLANDS AND EAST OF THE PENNINES 
TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWO IS POSSIBLE IN THE SOUTH NINETEEN AT YORK AND AS WE GO NORTH 
WE GET BACK UNDER THAT RAIN BELT WHICH WILL HAVE MADE PROGRESS 
AWAY FROM THE NORTH WEST OF SCOTLAND TO ALLOW CONDITIONS TO BRIGHTEN UP 
AND A SIMILAR PROSPECT ACROSS THE WEST OF NORTHERN IRELAND 
HAVING HAD SUCH A MISERABLE START TO THE DAY 
TOWARDS THE SOUTH AND EAST WE GET AWAY FROM THAT RAIN BAND 
AS WE MOVE INTO THE SOUTH EASTERN QUARTER OF WALES 
BUT ALWAYS ALWAYS THIS CLOUD QUITE THICK MISERABLE CONDITIONS 
OUT TOWARDS THE WESTERN COAST 
EVENTUALLY THE CLOUD WILL PRODUCE LIGHT RAIN AND DRIZZLE 
ACROSS NORTHERN AND WESTERN CORNWALL 
ALWAYS BETTER CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTH AND EAST 
HERE COMES THE CHANGE AS WE MOVE INTO SUNDAY 
THAT WEATHER FRONT MAKES PROGRESS TOWARDS THE SOUTH 
ALLOWING COOLER CONDITIONS TO MOVE IN ACROSS SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND 
THAT MEANS SOME DRY AND FINE WEATHER AS WE GET INTO SUNDAY 
AND SEE HOW THAT RAIN PERSISTS ACROSS A GOOD PART OF ENGLAND AND WALES 
FOR A GOOD PART OF THE DAY 
AS WE GET INTO THE START OF NEXT WEEK THINGS LOOKING UNSETTLED 
WET AND WINDY CONDITIONS FOR THE NORTH EAST OF SCOTLAND 
TO START OFF ON MONDAY THOSE CONDITIONS GRADUALLY PULLING AWAY 
IN THE SOUTH WE'LL SEE ANOTHER BELT OF WET AND WINDY WEATHER 
BRINGING QUITE A BIT OF RAINFALL AND THE TEMPERATURES ON THE WAY DOWN 
AS WE GET ON INTO TUESDAY 
LOTS GOING ON MORE DETAILS ON THE WEBSITE BUT FROM ME GOOD NIGHT 
I AM MISTRESS OF ALL I SURVEY 
YOU THREW YOUR LIFE AWAY BECAUSE HE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND YOUR CLEVER WORDS AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE 
MY CLEVER WORDS WILL SOON BE THE ONLY THING PUTTING A ROOF OVER MY HEAD 
WHAT HAPPINESS I AM ALL ALONE 
OUT OF STEP AND AHEAD OF HER TIME 
THE ONLY WAY TO GET A MAN LIKE MR. DARCY IS TO MAKE HIM UP 
THE UNTOLD STORY OF A GREAT STORYTELLER
