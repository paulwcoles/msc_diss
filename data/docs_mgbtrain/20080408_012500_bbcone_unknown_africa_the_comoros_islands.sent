BUT THERE ARE SECRET CORNERS OF THIS VAST CONTINENT 
I'VE NOT EVEN GLIMPSED 
NOW I'M DETERMINED TO CHANGE THAT 
TO DISCOVER THE WILDLIFE PEOPLE AND LANDSCAPES OF UNKNOWN AFRICA 
THE COMOROS ISLANDS ARE FOUR TINY SPECKS IN THE INDIAN OCEAN 
BARELY VISIBLE ON A MAP 
ALL CREATED BY VIOLENT VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS 
THE YOUNGEST ISLAND'S VOLCANO IS STILL NOTORIOUSLY ACTIVE 
HOME TO LIVING FOSSILS PTERODACTYL LIKE BATS 
SULTANS SLAVES AND PIRATES THESE ISLANDS OF FIRE ARE BORN OF LEGENDS 
APPARENTLY THERE'S A GOLDEN THRONE 
THAT'S BEEN HIDDEN DOWN INSIDE THIS CRATER 
THAT WAS LEFT HERE BY KING SOLOMON AND THE QUEEN OF SHEBA 
WHEN THEY CAME HERE ONE THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE THE BIRTH OF CHRIST 
TO GET MARRIED INSIDE THE CRATER 
BUT LEGEND ASIDE 
THIS IS ACTUALLY THE LARGEST ACTIVE CALDERA IN THE WORLD 
AND IT'S EXACTLY THIS VOLCANIC ACTIVITY 
THAT GAVE BIRTH TO THE COMOROS ISLANDS 
PUSHING THEM UP FROM THE SEA ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
AND WHILST IT LOOKS PRETTY BLEAK UP HERE FROM THIS POINT DOWNWARDS 
THE ISLAND'S BEEN COLONISED BY SOME PRETTY INTERESTING LIFE 
AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE COME HERE TO SEE 
THE WILDLIFE HERE HAS SHARED THESE ISLANDS WITH PEOPLE FOR NEARLY TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
FOR CENTURIES THE COMOROS PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN THE WORLD'S ECONOMY 
BUT WITH COLLAPSE OF INDIAN OCEAN TRADE 
AND THE OPENING OF THE SUEZ CANAL THE ISLANDS SIMPLY FELL OFF THE MAP 
IN RECENT YEARS A SERIES OF OVER TWENTY COUPS HAVE KEPT VISITORS AWAY 
THE COMOROS ISLANDS HAVE BECOME THE FORGOTTEN ISLANDS 
BUT WHAT OF ITS WILDLIFE WHAT DO THESE FORGOTTEN ISLES HOLD 
I'VE HEARD STORIES OF A LEGENDARY GIANT BAT THAT LIVES ONLY HERE IN THE COMOROS 
IT'S THE COUSIN OF THESE SMALLER COMORIAN FRUIT BATS 
WHICH ARE FOUND PRETTY MUCH ALL OVER THE ISLANDS 
BUT THE BAT I WANT TO SEE IS NOT GOING TO REVEAL ITSELF AS EASILY 
ALTHOUGH IT'S ONE OF THE LARGEST BATS IN THE WORLD 
IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE RAREST 
AND UNLIKE THESE GUYS IT'S ONLY FOUND ON THE MORE REMOTE ISLANDS 
OF THE FOUR ISLANDS THAT MAKE UP THE COMOROS 
ANJOUAN WITH ITS ANCIENT ISLAMIC CITIES 
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY ANCIENT RAINFORESTS 
IS PROBABLY MY BEST BET FOR FINDING THESE LEGENDARY BATS 
HERE THEY CALL THEM LIVINGSTONE'S FLYING FOX 
WITH NO IDEA WHERE TO START 
I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO NEED SOME HELP FINDING THEM 
BONJOUR BONJOUR MADAME 
BONJOUR BONJOUR MERCI BEAUCOUP 
DEEP IN THE MEDINA OF ANJOUAN 
I FINALLY MEET SOMEONE WHO SEEMS TO KNOW WHERE CAN FIND THE BATS 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE'S TAKING ME IT'S A BIT OF AN ADVENTURE 
ICI AH BIEN OUI OUI 
MAYBE SHE THINKS I'M COMING HERE LOOKING FOR CRAFTS OR SOMETHING 
IT'S A GREAT LITTLE HIGGLEDY PIGGLEDY TOWN THIS 
YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE WHAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE 
WHEN THEY WERE TRADING SLAVES SPICE IVORY 
PIRATES COMING HERE RANSACKING THIS PLACE CENTURY AFTER CENTURY 
LOOK AT THESE BEAUTIFUL OLD DOORS 
I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE ALL OF THESE ALLEYWAYS THAT YOU CAN DISAPPEAR UP 
AND WHO KNOWS WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN 
MORE BEAUTIFUL DOORS 
BONJOUR 
I THINK I'M ACTUALLY GETTING SOMEWHERE NOW 
HE'S JUST MENTIONING THAT THERE'S AN N. G. O. HERE CALLED ACTION COMORES 
WHO ARE ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN THE PRESERVATION OF THESE FLYING FOXES 
BONJOUR BONJOUR COMMENT ALLEZ VOUS 
TRES BIEN J. E. M'APPELLE SABA BONJOUR BONJOUR 
MOHAMED MOUTUI TELLS ME HE'S THE DIRECTOR OF ACTION COMORES 
TO MY SURPRISE HE SUGGESTS WE SET OFF IMMEDIATELY INTO THE MOUNTAINS 
TO TRY AND FIND SOME BATS 
THERE'S A RUMOUR OF SOME BATS DOWN HERE BY THE RIVER 
IF WE GET DOWN THERE ALIVE I THINK WE MIGHT SEE SOME 
WOW 
WE'VE GOT BATS RIGHT IN HERE 
INSIDE THE CAVE 
AND APPARENTLY MORE BEHIND THE WATERFALL 
SO THIS ISN'T THE LIVINGSTONE FLYING FOX 
THIS ISN'T THE LIVINGSTONE FLYING FOX THIS IS OBLIVIOUS FLYING FOX 
THEY LIVE IN CAVE 
BUT YOU NEED TO DIVE INTO THE RIVER AND TO CROSS THE CASCADE 
GO ON THEN IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY LET'S GO 
LET'S GO ALL RIGHT I'LL FOLLOW YOU O. K. ALL RIGHT 
BETTER BE WORTH IT 
WOW MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF BATS 
IT'S ALMOST PITCH BLACK 
AND MY TORCH IS TOO DIM TO REALLY PICK THEM OUT 
THESE ARE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF ROUSETTE'S FLYING FOX 
WHOO IT STINKS IN HERE AS WELL 
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY COULD LIVE TOGETHER IN PROXIMITY 
I THINK THEY LOOK LIKE BEES IN THE 
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THE HOUSE OF BEES 
HIVE IN THE HIVE 
A HIVE 
WELL THAT WAS DEFINITELY WORTH IT FANTASTIC 
MOUTUI TELLS ME THAT THE LIVINGSTONE FLYING FOXES 
ARE FOUND MUCH HIGHER IN THE MOUNTAINS 
AND PROMISES TO TAKE ME THERE IN A FEW DAYS' TIME 
THIS GIVES ME THE CHANCE TO GO IN SEARCH OF ANOTHER LEGENDARY ANIMAL 
WHO'S MADE THESE ISLANDS ITS HOME THE ELUSIVE COELACANTH 
THOUGHT TO HAVE GONE EXTINCT SEVENTEEN MILLION YEARS AGO 
THIS RELIC FROM THE AGE OF DINOSAURS MADE WORLD HEADLINES 
WHEN IT WAS FOUND ALIVE AND WELL LIVING HERE IN THE COMOROS 
I RECKON MY BEST CHANCE OF FINDING OUT MORE IS AT THE LOCAL FISH MARKET 
BONJOUR C. A. VA 
COMMENT S'APPELLE CETTE C'EST LE THON LE BONITA 
BONI ET LE THON OU C'EST 
SO WE'VE GOT TUNA HERE 
EITHER HIS FATHER OR HIS GRANDFATHER CAUGHT A COELACANTH 
BUT THESE DAYS THEY DON'T REALLY MANAGE TO DO THAT 
THESE GUYS ARE CERTAINLY GETTING A GOOD CATCH OF FISH 
LOTS OF BONITA BIT OF TUNA REALLY GOOD FISH TO EAT BUT 
I'M VERY GLAD TO SAY ABSOLUTELY NO SIGN OF ANY COELACANTH 
BUT I HAVE GOT A LEAD 
ITSOUNDZOU IS A NAME THAT KEEPS ON POPPING UP 
IT'S HERE ON THE WEST COAST OF GRANDE COMORE 
THAT FISHERMAN FROM ITSOUNDZOU VILLAGE HAVE OVER THE YEARS 
CAUGHT THE MOST COELACANTHS 
ITSOUNDZOU IS ALSO HOME TO LOCAL BIOLOGIST AND COELACANTH EXPERT SAID AHMADA 
THE COELACANTHS' CAVES ARE JUST DOWN THERE UNDERWATER 
THE COELACANTHS LIVE RIGHT DOWN HERE YES 
HOW EXCITING WHERE ARE WE GOING 
TO SEE THE CAVES 
WHERE THE COELACANTHS LIVE 
THEY LOOK LIKE THE UNDERWATER CAVES WHERE LIVE THE COELACANTHS 
EXACTLY THE SAME 
THIS IS THEM HERE YES ONE THERE YOU SEE HOW DEEPER IT IS 
WOW THESE ARE INCREDIBLE 
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ONE 
YES I SAW NINE OF THEM 
NINE ALIVE YES 
SAID IS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE IN THE WORLD 
TO HAVE TRAVELLED TWO HUNDRED METRES DOWN INTO THE DARK DEPTHS 
WHERE THE COELACANTH LIVES 
SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE SEEING A COELACANTH 
IT WAS AMAZING VERY WONDERFUL 
NOT ONLY BEAUTIFUL BUT LIKE MYSTERIOUS 
IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE MAGIC OR 
IT'S OTHERWORLDLY ESPECIALLY THE EYES 
THE EYES IS VERY SHINING 
IT'S VERY VERY STRANGE 
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY COELACANTHS THERE ARE DOWN THERE 
ACCORDING TO THE LAST ESTIMATION LAST EXPEDITION IN TWO THOUSAND 
THE POPULATION SHOULD BE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS 
WITH NO SUBMERSIBLES IN THE COMOROS 
I'M NOT GOING TO SEE A LIVING COELACANTH 
BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ANCIENT CREATURES IN THESE WATERS 
MOHELI IS THE SMALLEST AND LEAST DEVELOPED OF THE ISLES 
ITS BEACHES PLAY HOST TO A PREHISTORIC RITUAL 
TRACKS LIKE THESE HAVE BEEN APPEARING ON THESE BEACHES 
SINCE THE BIRTH OF THESE ISLANDS 
THIS IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST IMPORTANT GREEN TURTLE NESTING SITES 
AND BY THE LOOK OF THINGS IT'S A BUSY TIME OF YEAR 
I'M GONNA TO COME BACK AT NIGHTFALL TO TRY TO CATCH THEM IN THE ACT 
BACK ON THE TURTLE BEACH 
IT APPEARS THERE'S A LITTLE MORE THAN JUST NESTING HAPPENING TONIGHT 
OH WELL WHEN IN ROME 
WELL MAYBE SOMEBODY HERE CAN TELL ME WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON 
AND WHETHER OR NOT THE TURTLES ARE GOING TO ARRIVE 
ALTHOUGH IT'S THE LEAST POPULATED 
MOHELI'S PARTIES ARE THE ENVY OF THE OTHER ISLANDS 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE TURTLES ARE 
BUT I RECKON WHEN IT'S FINALLY CALMED DOWN HERE 
WE MIGHT HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF FINDING THEM 
UNTIL THEN I'M GOING TO DO WHAT THE ROMANS DO 
I'VE MET SOME STUDENTS AT THE PARTY WHO CALL THEMSELVES ECO GUARDS 
THEY PATROL THE BEACHES EVERY NIGHT DURING TURTLE SEASON 
THEY'VE ALLOWED ME TO JOIN THEM THIS EVENING WITH AN INFRA RED CAMERA 
WE'RE JUST APPROACHING THE BEACH WHERE WE'RE GONNA FIND THE TURTLES 
AND BECAUSE THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO LIGHT I'VE GOTTA TURN MY TORCH OFF 
SO THE LAST BIT'S GONNA BE IN COMPLETE DARKNESS 
WE'VE GOT LOTS OF TURTLE TRACKS COMING UP THE BEACH 
AND ONE OF THE GUYS HAS JUST RUN ON AHEAD 
AND HE'S SEEN THAT WE'VE FOUND A TURTLE WHO'S LAYING HER EGGS 
HELLO BEAUTY 
NOW THAT SHE'S ACTUALLY IN THE PROCESS OF LAYING 
IT'S FINE FOR US TO APPROACH HER FROM BEHIND 
GOD SHE'S ABSOLUTELY ENORMOUS 
SHE'S DUG HERSELF THIS HUGE BIG HOLE AND THEN UNDERNEATH HER 
SHE'S GOT THIS TINY LITTLE HOLE THAT SHE'S MADE ESPECIALLY FOR THE EGGS 
WHAT'S AMAZING IS THAT WE PASSED ABOUT EIGHT DIFFERENT TURTLE TRACKS 
COMING TO THIS FEMALE AND YOU CAN JUST HEAR THEM ALL AROUND US 
WE'RE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY TURTLES 
ALL LAYING THEIR EGGS TOGETHER ON THIS BEACH 
TOUS LES JOURS IL Y. A DES GARDES SUR LA PLAGE 
QUI TRAVAILLENT AVEC LES TORTUES 
C'EST POURQUOI A CE MOMENT LA ON A DU BLOQUER 
THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF REALLY BAD POACHING HERE IN THE PAST 
WHERE PEOPLE IN THIS REGION KILL TURTLES TO EAT THEIR MEAT 
AND SO THEY'VE HAD TO SET UP THIS ECO GUARD 
WHERE THEY ACTUALLY PATROL THE BEACHES AND STOP PEOPLE COMING DOWN 
EITHER SLAUGHTERING THE TURTLES OR STEALING THEIR EGGS 
AND NOW THAT THEY'VE GOT ECO GUARDS HERE 
THE POACHING'S ALMOST COMPLETELY STOPPED 
WHEN YOU SEE A TURTLE LIKE THIS 
YOU JUST CAN'T IMAGINE HOW ANYONE CAN EVEN THINK ABOUT KILLING IT 
SHE COULD BE ALMOST ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
J'AIME LES TORTUES 
PARCE QUE CE SONT DES ESPECES PROTEGEES 
ET LA MEME CHOSE J'AI BEAUCOUP BEAUCOUP D'AMIS A CAUSE DES TORTUES 
ET PUIS J. E. VOYAGE BEAUCOUP ENCORE POUR ALLER FAIRE DES FORMATIONS ET DES CHOSES COMME C. A. 
I WAS JUST ASKING HIM WHY HE DOES THIS WORK 
AND BASICALLY HE'S JUST PASSIONATE ABOUT TURTLES HE LOVES THEM 
HE LOVES WORKING WITH THEM HE LOVES TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT THEM 
HE LOVES MEETING OTHER PEOPLE 
WHO SPEND THEIR TIME WORKING WITH TURTLES 
I THINK SHE'S JUST MADE IT QUITE CLEAR THAT IT'S TIME FOR US TO GO 
AND LEAVE HER IN PEACE THIS IS CLEARLY EXHAUSTING WORK 
GOODBYE YOU OLD BEAUTY 
I'M BACK ON ANJOUAN ISLAND AND AS PROMISED MONSIEUR MOUTUI 
HAS PUT TOGETHER A TEAM TO HELP ME LOOK FOR THE LIVINGSTONE FLYING FOX 
THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO THE MOST REMOTE POCKETS OF VIRGIN RAIN FOREST 
WHICH MEANS WE'VE GOT TO CLIMB THE STEEPEST HIGHEST 
MOST INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAIN PEAKS 
IT'S OVER FIVE THOUSAND FEET TO THE SUMMIT 
HE'S FOUND A VERY RARE BIRD UP HERE 
WHAT KIND OF BIRD IS THIS 
IT'S CALLED IN COMORIAN CHIPANGA BUT IN FRENCH WE SAY L'EPERVIER 
SO WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE ONE OF THESE BIRDS HOW MANY YEARS AGO 
I THINK THREE OR FOUR YEARS THREE YEARS AGO 
I THOUGHT IT IS EXTINCTED 
WE'RE LUCKY VERY LUCKY 
IT'S GOT THESE PIERCING YELLOW EYES 
IT IS WATCHING US NOW WITH ONE EYE 
WHY DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING EXTINCT 
BECAUSE OF DEFORESTATION DEFORESTATION 
BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE OF DEFORESTATION FROM THE PEOPLE 
FROM THE PEOPLE I MEAN HOW MUCH FOREST DO YOU THINK YOU'VE LOST IN THE LAST TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS 
I THINK NINETY PER CENT 
NINETY PER CENT YEAH 
WITH FARMLAND ENCROACHING EVER HIGHER UP THE SLOPES OF ANJOUAN'S MOUNTAINS 
THERE ARE ONLY A HANDFUL OF BAT ROOSTS LEFT 
STILL NO SIGN OF BATS HERE BUT MOUTUI ASSURES ME 
THAT THIS HIGH FOREST IS PRIME LIVINGSTONE BAT TERRITORY 
LOOK AT THE BAT LOOK AT THE BAT 
WHEN YOU FIRST SEE THEM 
THEY LOOK JUST LIKE EAGLES SOARING UP ON THE RIDGES 
BUT THEN YOU SEE THEIR LEGS STICKING OUT THE BACK AND NO TAIL 
AND YOU REALISE IT'S A GIANT BAT 
ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A PTERODACTYL 
THE ROOSTS MUST BE SOMEWHERE NEARBY 
LOOK QUICK QUICK QUICK QUICK 
WE'VE GOT BATS JUST HERE 
IT'S MARVELLOUS 
FINDING LIVINGSTONE FLYING FOXES AT THE TOP OF THEIR WORLD 
IS A REAL DELIGHT 
BECAUSE OF HUMAN PRESSURE 
IT'S IN THESE SMALL POCKETS OF REMAINING FOREST 
THAT THE BATS' FUTURE WILL BE DECIDED 
BUT FOR NOW AT LEAST IT SEEMS THE BATS ARE HANGING ON IN THERE 
THERE IS A BABY BAT ON ONE OF THE FEMALES 
JUST TUCKED IN UNDERNEATH ITS ARMS 
JUST THE SWEETEST SIGHT 
OH LOOK AT THAT LOOK THE BABY'S OPENING UP ITS WINGS AS WELL 
LOOK THE BABY'S GOING OUT ONTO THE BRANCH ON ITS OWN 
THAT IS MAGICAL 
OH LOOK AT HIM 
HE'S HANGING UPSIDE DOWN WITH JUST HIS HANDS HOLDING ONTO THE BRANCHES 
BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE IT'S A WAY THE BABY MAKES HIS WAY TO THE TOILET 
THAT'S THE WAY HE GOES TO THE TOILET 
ALTHOUGH THE BATS ROOST ONLY IN VIRGIN FOREST 
THEY DO VENTURE DOWN FROM THE PEAKS TO FEED 
WOOOAH 
WATCH IT 
WOOAH 
IT'S VERY VERY SLIPPY 
MOUTUI LEADS THE WAY DOWN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN 
INTO AREAS THE BATS AND PEOPLE SHARE 
SO THE FARMERS ARE CLEARING ALL THE WAY UP THE MOUNTAINS 
YEAH HERE THE FARMERS ARE USING THE BAD METHOD OF CULTURE HERE 
SO THIS BAD METHOD IS TO CLEAR ALL THE SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAIN 
LIKE THIS WOMAN THERE IT'S A VERY BAD METHOD 
BEFORE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE THERE WERE HERE FORTY NINE RIVERS 
AND NOW WE CANNOT FIND EIGHT RIVERS 
THAT'S BECAUSE THE FOREST IS GONE 
AND YOU'RE LOSING THE WATER CATCHMENT 
BECAUSE THERE IS A BALANCE BETWEEN FOREST AND THE WATER 
I MUST SAY OF ALL THE BATS I'VE SEEN IN THE WORLD 
THESE ARE THE ONES THAT LOOK THE MOST LIKE BATMAN 
PROTECTING THE BATS MEANS PROTECTING THE FUTURE FOR PEOPLE ON ANJOUAN 
EXACTLY BATS WHEN WE PROTECT THE BATS WE ARE PROTECTING THE AREA 
THE BATS ARE ALL AROUND THE MOUNTAIN 
AND IF WE MAKE THE RESERVE OF BATS IT'S TO PROTECT FORESTS 
SO YOU HAVE A SMALL RESERVE 
THAT PROTECTS THE FOREST THE FOREST PROTECTS THE WATER CATCHMENT AREA 
THAT PROTECTS THE RIVERS AND THE BATS BECOME A SYMBOL OF THE FUTURE 
OF OUR FUTURE AND SYMBOL OF LIFE PROTECTION LIFE ITSELF 
FOR EVERYBODY EVERYBODY 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO PROTECT THE FORESTS LIKE BATMAN 
LIKE BATMAN 
I LIKE THIS WORD BATMAN 
IT'S A NATURAL BATMAN IT'S NOT HUMAN BATMAN 
TRYING TO PROTECT THE ISLAND 
TRYING TO PROTECT THE ISLAND 
THE COMOROS ARE CLEARLY NOT YOUR TYPICAL TROPICAL ISLANDS 
OF WHITE SANDY BEACHES AND COCKTAILS 
IT'S A PLACE OF ANCIENT RHYTHMS AND DRAMATIC HISTORY 
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THINGS ARE CHANGING FAST 
AND THE SURVIVAL OF THE ISLANDS IS AT STAKE 
THE LITTLE WILDLIFE THAT REMAINS IS NOT JUST A SYMBOL OF HOPE 
IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT 
THE VERY FUTURE OF THESE ISLANDS COULD DEPEND ON THE PRESERVATION OF ITS WILDLIFE 
THESE ARE NO ORDINARY KIDS 
THEY'RE SUPERKIDS GENETICALLY DESIGNED TO BEAT ADULTS 
JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN I'VE GOT QUITE A LOT STORED UP HERE 
I'M TWENTY SIX HE'S THIRTEEN SO ACCORDING TO ME HE'S HALF AS INTELLIGENT 
YOU WANNA FIND OUT WHO WINS 
JOIN US AND SEE IF THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT
