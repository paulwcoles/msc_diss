THE FIGHT GOES ON GREAT BRITISH MENU OUR MOST TALENTED CHEFS ARE BATTLING FOR THE CHANCE TO PROVE 
THAT MODERN BRITISH FOOD IS UP THERE WITH THE BEST IN THE WORLD 
THE WINNERS WILL PREPARE A FABULOUS FOUR COURSE MEAL AT THE TOP OF THE GHERKIN IN CENTRAL LONDON 
HOSTING THE BANQUET WILL BE THE CULINARY TRAILBLAZER HESTON BLUMENTHAL 
AND HIS GUESTS WILL INCLUDE OUTSTANDING CHEFS FROM AROUND THE GLOBE 
SO THE CHALLENGE FOR OUR CHEFS IS IMMENSE 
TOUGHING IT OUT IN THIS WEEK'S HEAT TO REPRESENT LONDON AND THE SOUTH EAST IN OUR FINALS 
ARE ATUL KOCHHAR AND JASON ATHERTON 
AND THEY BOTH HAVE GOT THEIR EYES ON THE PRIZE 
IF I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD SIT WELL IN THE IN THE GHERKIN I WOULDN'T BE HERE 
TO COMPETE AGAINST HIM IS AN HONOUR 
TO BEAT HIM WILL BE EVEN BIGGER HONOUR AND I'M EVERY BIT OUT THERE TO BEAT HIM 
JASON ATHERTON AND ATUL KOCHHAR ARE WELL MATCHED AS BOTH ARE MICHELIN STARRED LONDON CHEFS 
WITH INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCES TO SHOWCASE THEIR TALENT 
EACH CHEF HAS DREAMT UP A CUTTING EDGE FOUR COURSE MENU 
EVERY DAY THIS WEEK THEY'RE COOKING A DIFFERENT COURSE 
BEFORE PRESENTING THEIR ENTIRE MENU TO THE JUDGES ON FRIDAY 
THEY'RE VERY HARD TO PLEASE SO ONLY THE FINEST MODERN BRITISH COOKING 
WILL MAKE IT TO HESTON BLUMENTHAL'S BANQUET IN JUNE 
BOTH CHEFS ARE DESPERATE TO BE THERE BUT ONLY ONE CAN SURVIVE THIS WEEK 
SO THERE'S A GREAT DEAL AT STAKE AS ATUL AND JASON LIMBER UP FOR THEIR SECOND DAY OF BATTLE 
I'VE GOT EVEN TO BE EVEN MORE ON MY A GAME TODAY 
THAN I WAS YESTERDAY SO GOOD NICE SLEEP BIT OF A RUN THIS MORNING AND I'M FIT AND READY 
HE'S GIVING ME A GOOD RUN FOR MY MONEY 
BUT I THINK I'M GIVING HIM TOO SO IT'S GOOD COMPETITION HERE 
YESTERDAY THE TWO CHEFS BEGAN BY COOKING THEIR STARTER COURSE 
ATUL WENT FOR A CHILLED PEA SOUP WITH CUMIN FOAM ALONGSIDE A PLATE 
OF MINIATURE POPPADOMS OR POORI TOPPED WITH PEAS AND POTATO 
JASON PUSHED THE BOAT OUT 
WITH A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TAKE ON A PLATE OF SANDWICHES 
THE FLAVOURS OF A B. L. T. SERVED IN A GLASS 
ALONGSIDE AN EXOTIC CROQUE MONSIEUR WITH TRUFFLES 
NOW THEY'RE FACING DAY TWO AND A FRESH CHALLENGE AS BOTH CHEFS TACKLE THE FISH COURSE 
COME ON ATUL 
GOOD MORNING 
GOOD MORNING GOOD LUCK HOW THE DEVIL ARE YOU ALL RIGHT 
I'M GOOD I'M GOOD 
NICE SLEEP 
GOOD SLEEP THANK YOU HOW ABOUT YOU 
ALWAYS LIKE A BABY 
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING TODAY 
MAKING CONFIT OF SALMON 
IT'LL BE POACHED IN GOOSE FAT SEMOLINA POLENTA TOMATO CHUTNEY 
AND COCONUT SAUCE WITHOUT COCONUT IT WOULDN'T BE MADRAS 
RIGHT ABSOLUTELY SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING GOOD 
SO ATUL'S CREATING HIS VERSION OF A SALMON MADRAS A CONFIT OF SALMON 
SERVED WITH TOMATO CHUTNEY AND SEMOLINA POLENTA 
AND JASON HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE DISH STRAIGHT AWAY 
I SEE POLENTA THERE RIGHT YES THAT'S NOT ENGLISH 
SEMOLINA IS AND COCONUTS THEY NEVER GROW ON MY TREES IN SKEGNESS 
NO YOU SHOULD COME AND BORROW MINE YOU KNOW 
WE'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT OF ARGUMENTS ABOUT INGREDIENTS THAT CLEARLY AREN'T BRITISH 
BEING USED IN A COMPETITION CALLED GREAT BRITISH MENU 
BUT THE JUDGES HAVE TAKEN A VIEW THAT SINCE PRODUCE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD IS FREELY AVAILABLE HERE NOW 
ONLY THE MAIN INGREDIENT MUST BE BRITISH THEY ALONE DECIDE WHAT IS PERMISSIBLE 
WE'LL SEE LATER WE'LL SEE LATER TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE COOKING 
CURED SALMON WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING IN LONDON FOR THE LAST ONE HUNDRED TWENTY YEARS 
YOU CAN SEE THAT IS VERY VERY LIGHTLY SMOKED 
SO WE'RE GOING TO LIGHTLY COOK THAT IN THE WATER BATH RYE CRACKERS 
SO DARK RYE CRACKERS AVOCADOS 
SOME QUINTESSENTIAL HORSERADISH WHICH IS VERY VERY ENGLISH 
IT IS THAT'S GOING TO GO THROUGH A CENTRIFUGAL JUICER 
THEN WE'RE GONNA MAKE HORSERADISH SNOW WITH THIS 
SO JASON'S ALSO GONE FOR SALMON BUT HIS WILL BE SERVED WITH 
HORSERADISH SNOW WHICH SOUNDS INTERESTING A RYE BREAD CRACKER 
AVOCADO PUREE WATERCRESS AND A LITTLE CAVIAR WHICH GIVES ATUL 
AN IMMEDIATE CHANCE TO RETALIATE 
IS THAT ENGLISH CAVIAR UM 
IT SAYS CAVIAR IMPERIAL 
O. K. DON'T WORRY I GET IT 
ALTHOUGH HE'S LIVED IN THE SOUTH EAST FOR TWENTY YEARS NOW 
JASON ATHERTON HAILS FROM SKEGNESS 
WHERE HE HAD AN EARLY INTRODUCTION TO THE CATERING INDUSTRY 
MY MUM AND STEP DAD HAD A HOTEL ON THE EAST COAST 
AND WE USED TO HELP AS KIDS BUT NOTHING LIKE GOURMET CUISINE IT WAS REAL BASIC STUFF 
BUT MUM IS NOT A BAD COOK SHE'S O. K. 
SHE OVERCOOKS THE VEGETABLES BUT SHE'S ALL RIGHT 
HE CAME TO LONDON AT THE TENDER AGE OF SIXTEEN TO PURSUE HIS DREAM OF BECOMING A CHEF 
HE LEARNED CLASSICAL COOKERY IN FRENCH RESTAURANTS BUT THEN FOUND HIMSELF DRAWN TO SPAIN 
AND THE LEGENDARY EL BULLI RESTAURANT IN BARCELONA 
MY STYLE OF FOOD IS ABOUT MODERN TAPAS 
THE TIME I SPENT IN SPAIN I LIVED THERE FOR ABOUT A YEAR IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT 
AND TOOK ON THE SPANISH CULTURE OF SMALL DISHES AND I WANTED TO BRING THAT BACK TO LONDON 
SO JASON CAME BACK AND SLOWLY WORKED HIS WAY UP THE INDUSTRY 
HIS BIG BREAK CAME WHEN HE WAS SENT 
TO DUBAI BY GORDON RAMSAY TO HEAD UP ONE OF THE CELEBRITY CHEF'S RESTAURANTS THERE 
I WAS SENT OUT THERE WITH THREE ENGLISH COOKS 
THE REST WERE ALL FROM THE REGION SO I HAD TO TRAIN UP A WHOLE NEW BRIGADE WHICH WAS A REAL CHALLENGE 
NOT ONLY WITH THE LANGUAGE BUT ALSO WITH THE CULTURE SKILLS 
BUT THAT HELPS YOU MATURE AS A PERSON 
THAT WAS THE MAKING OF HIM REALLY 
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE CULTURE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY RUNNING A BRIGADE OF SEVENTY FIVE TO EIGHTY CHEFS 
AND TEACHING INDIVIDUALS FROM SCRATCH HIS LOVE OF FOOD 
JASON'S MODERN BRITISH TAPAS RESTAURANT IS UNDOUBTEDLY INFLUENCED BY HIS TRAVELS 
SO WHERE DOES HE GET HIS CULINARY STIMULATION FROM NOW WITH HIS FEET FIRMLY PLANTED IN THE CAPITAL 
LONDON CERTAINLY INSPIRED ME AS A CITY 
FOR THE SHEER FACT OF YOU'VE GOT SO MANY CULTURES INTO ONE POT 
THERE'S ONLY A COUPLE OF CITIES IN THE WORLD LONDON AND NEW YORK 
WHERE SO MANY CULTURES MERGE 
AND YOU GET A MELTING POT OF CUISINES WHERE YOU CAN PICK THE BEST ITALIANS INDIANS FRENCH 
I REALLY LOVE LONDON 
I CAN'T SEE ME LIVING ANYWHERE ELSE 
BUT WHILE JASON'S WORLDWIDE CREDENTIALS ARE IMPRESSIVE 
HE'LL NEED TO PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS TO BEAT THE REIGNING REGIONAL CHAMP ATUL KOCHHAR 
JASON'S STARTING BY HAVING A GO AT HIS RIVAL'S SEMOLINA WHICH IS GIVING HIM FLASHBACKS 
AT SCHOOL I WAS FORCE FED IT WITH REAL CRAP JAM ON TOP 
THAT WAS SORT OF MY IMAGE OF SEMOLINA IT WAS DISGUSTING 
AND I GUESS IT HAS NEVER IMPROVED 
I'M SURE YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT WONDERFUL BEING THE GOOD CHEF YOU ARE 
ATUL KOCHHAR HAS WON THE LONDON AND SOUTH EAST HEAT ON GREAT BRITISH MENU FOR TWO YEARS RUNNING 
HE WAS BORN IN INDIA AND HE TOO FOUND HIMSELF DRAWN TO THE KITCHEN AT AN EARLY AGE 
I GOT INTO FOOD 
BECAUSE OF THE FAMILY INFLUENCES I HAVE 
MY DAD RAN A CATERING BUSINESS MY MUM HELPED OUT 
MY SISTERS WERE GREAT COOKS 
WHENEVER THERE WAS A FESTIVITY IN THE HOUSE 
IT WAS DAD WHO WAS COOKING AND WE ALWAYS LOOKED FORWARD TO THAT 
WE LOOKED FORWARD FOR MUM TO GO OUT SO THAT DAD CAN COOK 
INSPIRED BY HIS FATHER'S TALENT ATUL TRAINED IN THE KITCHENS 
OF SOME OF INDIA'S GREAT HOTELS WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF THE COUNTRY'S TOP CHEFS 
IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR HE DECIDED TO LEAVE HIS FAMILY AND HIS HOMELAND TO REFINE HIS SKILLS IN BRITAIN 
I GREW UP IN INDIA AND ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I CAME TO THE U. K. 
WAS THE HUGE INFLUENCE OF FOOD I WAS ACTUALLY OBSERVING THROUGH MEDIA AND NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES 
I WANTED TO MAKE MY MARK HERE 
I KNEW I'M GOOD 
I COULD BE COMPETITIVE IN THIS FIELD 
AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF HARD WORK ATUL BECAME THE FIRST INDIAN CHEF TO WIN A MICHELIN STAR HERE 
BUT EVEN THE MOST COMMITTED CHEFS NEED A GOOD WORK LIFE BALANCE 
AND ATUL HAS ALWAYS MANAGED TO MAKE ROOM IN HIS HECTIC AGENDA FOR HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN 
MISHA WANTS SOME MORE 
WE'RE A CLOSE KNIT FAMILY 
I TRY TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME AS I CAN WITH THEM 
I THINK I'M HONOURED TO HAVE CHILDREN LIKE THEM 
ARE YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME 
IS HE TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE FAMILY TRADITION BY INSPIRING HIS OWN CHILDREN 
WITH HIS SKILL IN THE KITCHEN 
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT THAT I COOK ONLY INDIAN FOOD AT HOME 
SOMETIMES WE JUST MAKE A PIZZA 
MY DAUGHTER HELPS AND CHIPS IN THROWING THE DOUGH AROUND OR WE JUST MAKE PASTA OR WHATEVER 
YOU KNOW VERY SIMPLE INGREDIENTS SO IT'S DEFINITELY NOT THE RESTAURANT FOOD 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN BOTH CHEFS ARE HARD AT WORK 
ATUL IS CONCENTRATING ON THE SEMOLINA POLENTA FOR HIS SALMON MADRAS 
WHILE JASON'S DISCOVERED THAT MAKING HORSERADISH SNOW FOR HIS DISH IS A MOVING EXPERIENCE 
SEE THE PAIN I'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH FOR THIS 
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT 
THIS HORSERADISH IS POWERFUL 
I'M SO UPSET BECAUSE I'VE BEEN GIVING YOU A HARD TIME AND NOW I CAN'T DEAL WITH MY GUILTY CONSCIENCE 
I'M HAVING A BIT OF A MOMENT 
ONCE JASON'S HORSERADISH HAS HAD THE LIFE WELL AND TRULY 
SQUEEZED OUT OF IT HE HEATS THE JUICE WITH DOUBLE CREAM AND MILK 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE KITCHEN ATUL HAS MIXED SEMOLINA POLENTA WITH ONION MUSTARD SEED AND LENTILS 
WHICH HIS OPPONENT HAS A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT 
THOSE ARE LENTILS YOU'RE FRYING OFF YES LENTIL 
SO ONCE YOU FRY THEM THEY KIND BEFORE BECOME A NUT AND THAT IS THE FLAVOUR 
SO THEY GIVE IT A KIND OF NUTTY FLAVOUR 
SO ALL THAT STUFF I'VE BEEN TAUGHT ABOUT SOAKING THEM 
OVERNIGHT OTHERWISE YOU GET THE TRUMPS RIGHT 
IS THAT ALL LIKE CRAP 
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT IF I EAT THAT NOW I'M NOT GOING TO GET THE TRUMPS AM I 
UMM LOOK 
ALMOST FORTY PER CENT OF INDIA EATS THIS SO YOU CAN'T IMAGINE THAT 
YOU KNOW THEY'RE SLEEPING WITH THEIR TUMMY ACHING EVERY NIGHT 
ATUL'S PREPARING THE TOMATOES FOR HIS CHUTNEY NOW BUT 
SEEING THAT JASON HAS MADE THE MIXTURE FOR HIS HORSERADISH SNOW 
HE DECIDES TO SOW A SEED OF DOUBT 
ARE YOU SURE THE JUDGES ARE GOING TO LIKE THAT STRONG FLAVOUR 
HORSERADISH 
COME ON HOW CAN THAT BE STRONG 
YOU JUST WORRY ABOUT YOUR TRUMPY LENTILS O. K. AND LET ME WORRY ABOUT THE HEAT OF MY HORSERADISH 
HE PUTS HIS SNOW INTO THE FRIDGE TO COOL 
WHILE HAVING ADDED SOME OF HIS EXOTIC SPICES 
ATUL IS NOW COOKING HIS CHUTNEY 
JASON'S ABOUT TO START WORK ON THE CENTRE PIECE OF HIS DISH THE WILD SALMON 
WHICH HE HAD RESEARCHED CAREFULLY BEFORE THE COMPETITION 
HE NATURALLY WANTED THE FINEST SALMON IN THE REGION FOR GREAT BRITISH MENU 
AND TRAVELLED TO STRATFORD EIGHT MILES EAST FROM HIS RESTAURANT 
HE'D COME IN SEARCH OF THE U. K.'S OLDEST ESTABLISHED SALMON CURERS AND SMOKERS 
H. FORMAN AND AMP SON 
I'M A BIG FAN OF THE CURE 
WE'VE USED IT AT THE RESTAURANT FOR A FEW YEARS NOW AND I THINK IF WE GET IT 
WITH THE RIGHT SALMON IT'S GOING TO GIVE ME SOME AMMUNITION TO BEAT ATUL 
FOUNDED IN NINETEEN OH FIVE THIS FAMILY BUSINESS IS NOW 
IN ITS FOURTH GENERATION AND WHILE THEY SUPPLY ALL MANNER OF FISH 
SMOKED SALMON IS THEIR SPECIALITY 
JASON CAUGHT UP WITH LANCE FORMAN WHO'S NOT ONLY THE MANAGING DIRECTOR 
BUT THE GREAT GRANDSON OF THE ORIGINAL OWNER 
LANCE IS THE MAN IN THE KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO PREPARING THE BEST WILD SALMON 
WE'RE NOT IN THE SALMON SEASON YET FOR WILD SALMON BUT STILL BUY A LOT OF WILD SALMON WHICH WE FREEZE 
BECAUSE WILD SALMON IS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR TWO OR THREE MONTHS IN THE SUMMER 
SO IF YOU WANT TO SMOKE IT ALL YEAR ROUND AS WE DO 
YOU HAVE TO FREEZE IT RAW THEN YOU HAVE FISH FOR SMOKING THE REST OF THE YEAR IT'S THE TRADITIONAL WAY 
USING A METHOD KNOWN AS THE LONDON CURE PROCESS 
THE SALMON ARE COVERED IN PURE ROCK SALT TO DRAW OUT ANY MOISTURE BEFORE SMOKING 
THIS IS A TRADITIONAL CURING PROCESS 
WE LOSE ABOUT FIFTEEN PER CENT OF THE OF THE WEIGHT THROUGH THIS PROCESS 
THE FISH WILL SIT HERE LIKE THIS FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
THEY ARE THEN RINSED AND DRIED BEFORE BEING SMOKED WITH OAK 
THEY'VE BEEN USING THE SAME PROCESS HERE FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
BUT THE MACHINERY HAS NOW MOVED FIRMLY INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
I WAS JUST ASSUMING IT'S SMOKED IN LIKE A CLAY OR SORT OF THINGY OVEN 
AND THIS IS LIKE WILLY WONKA'S CHOCOLATE FACTORY IT'S AMAZING 
AFTER SMOKING THERE'S JUST ONE MORE CRITICAL OPERATION BEFORE THE SALMON 
CAN BE SLICED FOR THE CUSTOMERS THE FISH IS STILL FULL OF TINY BONES 
THERE ARE MACHINES THAT DO IT BUT THEY'RE NOT TERRIBLY SUCCESSFUL 
WE TOOK OUT ABOUT EIGHT MILLION BONES OUT OF FISH LAST YEAR 
SO THAT WILL THEN BE READY FOR THE CUSTOMER 
THAT'S NOW READY FOR THE CUSTOMER 
OR SOME OF THEM OBVIOUSLY ALREADY WANT IT READY SLICED 
BUT NOW WE'RE READY TO EAT IT 
HAVING SEEN THE ENTIRE PRODUCTION PROCESS IT'D BE A CRIME NOT TO SAMPLE THE PRODUCT 
M. M. M. IT'S REALLY GOOD SUCH A PREMIER PRODUCT 
HOPEFULLY IT'LL BLOW THE JUDGES AWAY 
ABSOLUTELY YOU DO THAT 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN AGAIN 
JASON'S DIVIDING HIS LONDON CURE SALMON INTO HEALTHY PORTIONS 
THE NEXT JOB IS TO BAG UP THE FISH WITH SOME EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL 
BEFORE VACUUM PACKING THE PARCELS TO REMOVE THE AIR 
THE FINAL STAGE IN THE PROCESS IS TO DROP THE FISH INTO A FORTY DEGREE WATER BATH FOR TEN MINUTES 
IT'S ALL VERY MODERN AND IT HASN'T ESCAPED ATUL'S NOTICE 
WHAT IS YOUR EXPECTATIONS FROM A MODERN BRITISH RESTAURANT MAKING SURE THE FOOD'S NICE AND LIGHT 
I THINK THAT'S A MASSIVE TRAIT OF OUR MODERN BRITISH FOOD AT THE MOMENT 
MAKING SURE IT'S FULL OF FLAVOUR FIRST AND FOREMOST 
AND A FEW LITTLE TRENDY TECHNIQUES IN THERE THAT'S ABOUT IT REALLY 
WHAT WOULD YOU PERCEIVE TO BE ON THE MENU OF A MODERN BRITISH RESTAURANT 
I WOULD DEFINITELY LOOK FOR 
B. L. T. AND CROQUE MONSIEUR WOULD YOU 
GET OUT OF TOWN 
STILL TO COME ON GREAT BRITISH MENU JASON'S LEFT KICKING HIS HEELS 
I'LL GET YOU A NEWSPAPER TOMORROW 
AND BOTH CHEFS FIND FAULT AT THE TASTING 
THE COMPETITION'S HOTTING UP IN THE KITCHEN 
BOTH CHEFS ARE EAGER TO SERVE DISHES WHICH REFLECT THEIR INDIVIDUAL STYLE 
AND EXEMPLIFY MODERN BRITISH COOKERY 
SO JASON'S SERVING CURED SMOKED SALMON WITH A RYE BREAD CRACKER 
HE'S CONTRASTING THE FISH WITH AN AVOCADO PUREE 
TOPPED WITH HORSERADISH SNOW AND WATERCRESS 
MY DISH TODAY IS REALLY 
SIMPLE IN PRESENTATION BUT QUITE IN DEPTH IN TECHNIQUE 
SORT OF A LITTLE BIT OF THE MODERN SORT OF TECHNIQUES COME ON BOARD 
WITH THE WATER BATHS AND THE HORSERADISH SNOW SO IT'S QUITE AN UNUSUAL COMBINATION 
ATUL'S DISH IS HIS VERSION OF A FISH MADRAS 
SPICY SALMON CONFIT TOMATO CHUTNEY AND SEMOLINA AND LENTIL POLENTA 
BUT IS IT MODERN ENOUGH FOR THIS YEAR'S COMPETITION 
BRINGING THIS DISH MY MAIN IDEA WAS TO TELL PEOPLE 
WHAT BRITISH CUISINE HAS COME UP BASICALLY WHERE IT IS NOW 
IT'S JUST NOT FISH AND CHIPS OR IT'S JUST NOT BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING IT HAS COME OF AGE 
IT'S FANTASTIC IT'S ARRIVED 
JASON'S PREPARING HIS RYE BREAD CRACKER 
BUT HE'S NOTICED THAT HIS RIVAL IS PUTTING A LOT OF SPICE INTO HIS SAUCE 
SPICY DISH SPICINESS IS ONE THING AND HEAT IS ANOTHER 
SO SPICY I DON'T MIND BUT IF THE FLAVOURS OF THE SPICES ARE THERE NOT CHILLI HEAT YOU KNOW 
PEOPLE GET MISTAKEN ABOUT THE FLAVOUR OF CHILLI TO THE HEAT OF CHILLI 
ATUL'S RENOWNED AS A MASTER OF SPICING AND THIS SAUCE INCLUDES 
GREEN CHILLI SAMBAR SPICE POWDER CURRY LEAVES AND TURMERIC 
IF IT'S A FOUR COURSE MENU AND SPICES ARE NOT REPRESENTED IN ANY FORM 
I THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY POOR BRITISH MENU YES 
THAT'S MY PERSONAL THING I'M SURE 
YOU'RE THE SPICE MASTER 
WELL THE JUDGES WILL HAVE TO DECIDE ON FRIDAY 
WHETHER ATUL IS RIGHT AND THERE SHOULD BE SPICES ON THE MENU AT HESTON'S TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BANQUET 
FOR THE MAIN INGREDIENT IN HIS DISH ATUL'S ALSO USING THE KING OF FISH 
BUT UNLIKE JASON HE WANTED HIS SALMON TO BE ORGANIC FARMED PRODUCE 
SO HE WENT LOOKING FOR THE BEST 
HE'S USED THE SAME TOP QUALITY FISH MERCHANTS FOR A LONG TIME 
TIME BUT HAS NEVER ACTUALLY VISITED THEM SO IT WAS HIGH TIME HE DID 
HE MADE HIS WAY UP TO KING'S CROSS IN NORTH LONDON 
ESTABLISHED FOR OVER SIXTEEN YEARS DAILY FISH SUPPLIES ARE ONE OF LONDON'S 
LEADING PURVEYORS OF FRESH FROZEN AND PROCESSED FISH 
ATUL WAS KEEN TO MEET UP WITH MANAGING DIRECTOR BOB LEE 
UNTIL NOW HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A VOICE ON THE END OF A PHONE 
HI ATUL HEY BOBBY HOW ARE YOU PLEASED TO MEET YOU 
GOOD TO MEET YOU MAN AFTER ALL THESE YEARS YOU'VE SUPPLIED ME FINALLY I GET TO SEE YOU 
THE COMPANY HANDLES SIX THOUSAND KILOS OF SALMON EVERY WEEK BUT BOB HAD SAVED THE VERY BEST FOR ATUL 
ATUL THIS IS THE ORGANIC SALMON WE'RE GOING TO BE USING TODAY 
TREMENDOUS FISH FROM SCOTLAND ORGANIC FARMED SALMON 
ORGANIC FARMED YES I'VE GONE OFF THE WILD SALMON 
EVER SINCE READ ABOUT IT THAT THE STOCKS ARE DEPLETING 
I DO WANT TO LEAVE THINGS BEHIND FOR THE FUTURE GENERATIONS TO COME 
WE SHOULD BE AFTER RESPONSIBILITY SUSTAINABILITY 
THIS IS A GOOD CHOICE THE ORGANIC FARMED SALMON IS A GOOD CHOICE 
FILLETING MAY LOOK EASY BUT IT TAKES SKILL TO DO IT WELL 
EVEN THE SMALLEST MISTAKE COULD RUIN AN EXPENSIVE FISH SO BOB TRAINS HIS STAFF CAREFULLY 
IT TAKES AROUND SIX MONTHS BEFORE WE LET THEM LOOSE ON A SALMON 
WE START THEM OFF WITH MACKEREL HERRINGS SMALLER ROUNDER FISH 
JUST GETTING USED TO THE ACTUAL KNIFE FEELING OF THE KNIFE IN THE FISH 
TO GET TO KEVIN'S STANDARD YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT AROUND ABOUT NINE MONTHS WOW 
THAT'S A SHEER SKILL 
IT'S A GREAT SKILL ABSOLUTELY 
I MEAN WE ROUGHLY FILLET OFF AROUND ABOUT TWO TONNE OF SALMON EVERY DAY 
TWO TONNE OF SALMON A DAY WOW 
IT'S A LOT OF FISH 
HOW MUCH I BUY 
ONE OR TWO FISH A DAY WHICH IS ABOUT TEN KILO 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN ATUL'S FILLETING HIS OWN SALMON 
IT'S TOP MARKS FOR EFFORT BUT NO MARKS FOR SAVING TIME 
AS JASON BROUGHT IN HIS SALMON ALREADY PREPARED 
IT'S READY TO COME OUT OF THE WATER BATH NOW AND HE HAS EVERY REASON TO BE PLEASED WITH HIMSELF 
GOING REALLY WELL I THINK I'M AHEAD OF TIME SALMON'S DOWN I'VE GOT TO CHILL IT DOWN 
MY SNOW'S IN THE FREEZER READY TO BE SCRAPED MY CROUTONS ARE IN THE OVEN 
I'VE JUST GOT TO MAKE MY AVOCADO PUREE AND AS ALWAYS I'M ON SCHEDULE 
WHICH IS MORE THAN CAN BE SAID OF HIS RIVAL BEFORE ATUL CAN COOK HIS SALMON 
HE NEEDS TO SAUTE SOME CHILLI AND SPICES IN GOOSE FAT 
AND THEN ADD THE MIXTURE TO A PAN OF WATER IT'S A METHOD THAT JASON'S NOT FAMILIAR WITH 
IF YOU WANT REAL FLAVOUR THEN YOU SAUTE THE SPICES IN VERY LITTLE OIL 
AND IT WILL DRAW ALL THE FLAVOURS OUT AND ADD THAT OIL INTO YOUR POACHING LIQUID 
YOU'LL GET A REAL HECK OF A PUNCH 
FOR PERFECT SALMON ATUL'S PAN NEEDS TO BE AT FORTY DEGREES CENTIGRADE 
BUT HE'S OVERHEATED THE POACHING LIQUID SO HE'LL HAVE TO LET IT COOL DOWN 
IT'S A DELAY HE COULD DO WITHOUT 
JASON'S ALREADY WORKING ON THE FINAL ELEMENT IN HIS DISH THE AVOCADO PUREE 
HE'S BLITZING TOGETHER AVOCADO CREME FRAICHE 
AND LIME TO FORM A BASE FOR HIS HORSERADISH SNOW 
IT'S A NOVEL IDEA AND ATUL IS INTRIGUED 
WHY SNOW SNOW BECAUSE 
AGAIN IT'S THE MODERN BRITISH THING ISN'T IT 
I COULD HAVE 
QUITE EASILY HAVE BAILED OUT AND PUT HORSERADISH CREAM WITH IT PUT IT IN FRONT OF THE JUDGES 
PUT A DOLLOP OF CREAM ON IT JUST LIKE YOU WOULD WITH YOUR ROAST BEEF 
BUT THAT'S NOT USING MODERN TECHNIQUES IS IT 
DO YOU LIKE SNOW 
I LOVE SNOW THERE YOU GO 
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE MY HORSERADISH SNOW DO YOU THINK I THINK SO 
ON ATUL'S SIDE OF THE KITCHEN HE'S WATCHING HIS TEMPERATURE GAUGE LIKE A HAWK WILLING IT TO GO DOWN 
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GET HIS FISH ON SOON OR THEY'LL BE HERE ALL DAY 
JASON IS POSITIVELY STORMING AHEAD NOW AND HE THINKS THAT ATUL SHOULD GET A MOVE ON 
WHAT'S CAUSED THE DELAY WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG 
I THINK IT'S THE OIL GOT TOO HOT FOR THE GOOSE FAT AND ONCE IT GETS HOT IT TAKES A LITTLE TIME TO COOL DOWN 
THAT'S WHAT'S DELAYED ME HALF AN HOUR RIGHT 
BUT AS AND WHEN IT COMES OUT WE'LL BE READY TO PLAY 
IT'S A SETBACK ATUL HADN'T PLANNED FOR 
SO EXACTLY TWENTY MINUTES I NEED ON THIS TEMPERATURE 
AND JASON'S HAPPY TO MILK THE SITUATION 
I'M TIMING YOU RIGHT 
DON'T TIME ME PLEASE GO 
ATUL'S NOW UNDER PRESSURE AS HE HAS TO FRY HIS SEMOLINA POLENTA IN DOUBLE QUICK TIME 
HE'S ALSO GOT A CURRY LEAF FOAM ON THE GO BUT NOTICING THAT JASON 
IS JUST WATCHING HIM HE FINALLY SEES THE FUNNY SIDE 
I'LL GET YOU A NEWSPAPER TOMORROW 
I WAS GOING TO BRING MY D. V. D. PLAYER 
IT'S ALL A MATTER OF CO ORDINATION BOTH MEN MUST FINISH 
SIMULTANEOUSLY BUT WHILE ATUL TRIES TO MAKE UP TIME 
JASON CAN ONLY TWIDDLE HIS THUMBS 
HE'S EAGER TO GET ON WITH IT THOUGH 
I CAN GO PUT IT IN FOUR MINUTES 
YES GO GO GO 
WE HAVE A FISH SLICER HERE OR NOT AT LAST 
ATUL QUICKLY PAN FRIES HIS SALMON WHILE JASON PREPARES TO PLATE UP 
I'M JUST GOING TO GET MY SNOW OUT 
ARE YOU READY YEAH GO ON 
THIS IS WHERE THEIR SKILL OF PRESENTATION COMES INTO PLAY 
FOR JASON IT'S A SWISH OF AVOCADO PUREE A SPOONFUL OF CAVIAR 
AND THEN THE SUCCULENT SALMON TOPPED OFF WITH A RYE BREAD CRACKER 
HOW IS THE SNOW COMING ALONG 
WOW LOOK AT THAT YOU'D THINK IT WAS TWENTY FIFTH DECEMBER 
OH GOD LOOK AT THAT BEAUTIFUL 
ATUL'S DISH IS SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLEX 
THANKFULLY THE SALMON SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED OUT WELL 
NOW HE ADDS THE TOMATO CHUTNEY TO HIS SEMOLINA POLENTA 
HE SURROUNDS THE FISH WITH SAMBAR MOLE SAUCE BUT IS HE OUT OF TIME 
CAN I HAVE MY FOAM PLEASE FOUR THREE 
LET'S GO LET'S GO 
SO HERE ARE THE ENTRIES FOR THE LONDON AND SOUTH EAST FISH COURSE 
JASON'S WILD SALMON WITH AVOCADO 
AND ATUL'S SALMON MADRAS WITH SEMOLINA POLENTA 
TWO MOUTH WATERING DISHES BUT WHAT WILL THEY TASTE LIKE 
JASON'S DISH IS GOING FIRST 
HE'S TASTING HIS SALMON IN THE KITCHEN WHILE ATUL TAKES HIS PLATE INTO A PRIVATE ROOM 
TO GIVE HIS HONEST OPINION 
ALL OF IT LOOKS NICE 
THE SNOW IS THE ONLY THING WHICH LOOKS CLUMSY TO ME 
BUT JASON'S RATHER PLEASED WITH IT 
THE IDEA OF THE SNOW IS FOR IT TO SORT OF DANCE ON YOUR TONGUE WHEN 
YOU'RE SORT OF TAKING IT IT SORT OF MELTS STRAIGHTAWAY FROM SNOW TO SLUSH 
SLUSH THAT'S NO WAY TO DESCRIBE YOUR OWN FOOD JASON 
BUT WHAT DOES HIS RIVAL MAKE OF THE DISH OVERALL 
ON THE PLATE IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL 
BUT IN TERMS OF FLAVOURS TO BE HONEST IT DOESN'T DO MUCH 
SO IT'S TASTELESS ANYTHING ELSE 
CAVIAR I FIND IT UNNECESSARY ON THE PLATE 
WELL DON'T HOLD BACK 
THERE'S NO BALANCE ACTUALLY 
CRISP TO THIS ONE IS BALANCE WHEREAS THE SALMON DOESN'T GET 
BALANCED OFF ANYTHING 
THAT'S WHERE IT I FEEL THAT IT'S WEAK 
BUT JASON'S SATISFIED THAT HE'S DONE A GOOD JOB 
YOU COULD SAY SAFE AND SIMPLE BUT YOU SAW 
THE TECHNIQUES THAT GO INTO IT IN THE WRONG HANDS THIS DISH IS A DISASTER 
HE'S PLAYED VERY SAFE LONDON CURED SALMON 
IF SNOW IS THE WOW FACTOR THEN I REST MY CASE 
SO WILL THERE BE A WOW FACTOR IN ATUL'S DISH 
WELL VERY COLOURFUL THAT'S FOR SURE LOTS OF COLOURS GOING ON 
IT'S QUITE A BIG PORTION BUT THE PROOF'S IN THE PUDDING 
AS IT HAPPENS ATUL AGREES ABOUT THE PORTION SIZE 
SMALLER QUANTITY WOULD DO BECAUSE I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE HALF THE HEIGHT 
WHEN I WAS CUTTING I DIDN'T REALISE IT 
SALMON PORTION ITSELF CAN BE A LITTLE MORE SMALLER 
BUT WHAT DOES JASON MAKE OF THE TASTE 
LOSE THE EMULSION DOESN'T REALLY NEED THAT COS THOSE TOGETHER WORK PERFECTLY 
AND THE MADRAS CURRY SAUCE IS SO POWERFUL 
SO STRONG THAT WHEN YOU TRY AND MIX THAT IN WITH IT IT'S COMPLETELY LOST 
SO JASON THINKS THAT ATUL SHOULD FORGET HIS EMULSION THE TRICKY FOAM BUT DOES HE AGREE 
I QUITE LIKE THE FOAM IT'S GOT A REALLY STRONG FLAVOUR OF CURRY LEAF AND THEN 
LIME CUTS THROUGH 
LITTLE MORE FOAM WILL BE REQUIRED I THINK MORE FOAM 
MORE OF ANYTHING IS TOO MUCH FOR JASON 
I THINK HE'S GOT TO SCALE DOWN DEFINITELY AND THEN GO ON TO A MAIN COURSE 
SO DOES HE HAVE ANY FINAL THOUGHTS 
COURSE MY DISH IS BETTER 
IT'S CREATED BY ME 
WE'LL HEAR WHAT THE JUDGES THINK ABOUT THEIR FISH COURSES ON FRIDAY 
TOMORROW THE CHEFS WILL BE COOKING THEIR MAIN COURSES AND THERE'S NO SMOKE WITHOUT FIERY COMMENTS 
YOU CAN YOU SMELL IT YES A BURNT SMELL ANYONE CAN SMELL IT 
FIRE ENGINE'S OUT THERE 
THE COMPETITION CONTINUES TOMORROW ON GREAT BRITISH MENU
