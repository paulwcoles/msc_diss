HOW DOES A HEAD FLOAT 
ANAEROBIC DECOMPOSITION 
A. N. A. WHAT A. N. A. 
YOU'VE GOT THE VICTIM'S HEAD AND IT'S TIGHTLY SEALED IN A PLASTIC BAG 
BUT OVER TIME THE HEAD DECOMPOSES PRODUCING GASES THAT INFLATE THE BAG 
THE SUITCASE IS DISTURBED THE HEAD POPS OUT BOBS TO THE SURFACE AND THAT'S WHAT LED US TO THE SUITCASE 
RIGHT SEE YOU IN THERE I'LL CHECK THESE 
I LOVED HIM 
SO I WANTED TO SEE MORE 
BUT WHY KILL HIM 
BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS ALIVE I COULDN'T SEE THE PART OF HIM THAT I REALLY WANTED TO SEE 
WHAT PART 
THE PART THAT GOD MADE 
AND YOU BELIEVE IN GOD 
I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A LIFE FORCE 
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN IT WHEN IT LEAVES PEOPLE 
IT'S PURE IT'S VERY SHARP 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT GOES TO 
BUT WHEN IT'S MOVING BETWEEN THE BODY AND THAT PLACE 
YOU CAN SEE IT 
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE 
I CAN SHOW YOU 
IF YOU WANT 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
WE BOTH KNOW THAT PRETTY SOON NOW I'M GOING TO BE DEAD 
IF YOU'RE THERE WITH ME WHEN I GO 
YOU'LL SEE IT 
DID YOU GET ALL THE FORENSIC REPORTS FOR THE ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION 
YES I DID YES HELLO THIS IS THE SKULL OF JAMES READING REMEMBER HIM 
GOVERNOR OF HORTON PRISON EXACTLY 
AH PRISON HEAD GETS THE CHOP 
YEAH I DO REMEMBER 
GOOD HIS HEADLESS CORPSE WAS DISCOVERED BY HIS TEENAGE DAUGHTER IN THE FAMILY HOME ON OCTOBER NINETEENTH TWO THOUSAND ONE 
THE SKULL WAS FOUND ALONG WITH THIS SUITCASE CONTAINING THESE ITEMS 
IN A CANAL THAT'S ABOUT A TEN MINUTE WALK FROM THE MURDER SCENE 
ARE THESE THE MURDER WEAPONS I DON'T KNOW 
GOOD EVEN ING S. I. R. 
LINDA ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER READING SIGNED OUT OF THE PRISON AT SIX THIRTY P. M. AS NORMAL 
HIS DRIVER DROPPED HIM OFF AT HIS HOUSE AT SIX FORTY SEVEN P. M. 
HIS DAUGHTER CATHY READING RETURNED AT ELEVEN THIRTY P. M. AND FOUND HIM LIKE THIS 
SHE CALLED THE POLICE 
SHE WAS AT A LOCAL BOWLING ALLEY FROM SEVEN FORTY FIVE P. M. TO ELEVEN FIFTEEN P. M. 
THIS IS HER IN A BLOW UP PICTURE 
TIME OF DEATH WAS ESTIMATED BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE O'CLOCK I REMEMBER 
THE PAPERS MADE THIS OUT TO BE A REVENGE KILLING 
YEAH BECAUSE OF THE MUTILATION OF THE BODY AND ALSO THE THEFT OF THE TROPHIES 
WHAT WERE THEY FOR THESE TROPHIES 
THIS ONE'S FOR MERITORIOUS CONDUCT 
YOU GET TROPHIES AND AWARDS DO YOU FOR RUNNING A PRISON OH YOU DO 
TOP GUV GETS TOPPED 
THERE WERE TWO SUSPECTS 
TERRY RYAN 
SIX YEARS FOR THE RAPE AND GBH OF A YOUNG MALE PROSTITUTE 
I WANT YOUR QUEEN PRIOR CONVICTIONS SEX ASSAULTS ON MALES AND FEMALES DATING BACK TO HIS TEENS 
AND MICHAEL KELLEHER THE SWEETEST TAKE DOWN IS ALWAYS THE KING 
RAPE AND MURDER OF A YOUNG MAN PRIOR CONVICTIONS FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENT ASSAULT ON YOUNG MEN 
AND THE YOUNG KNIGHTS 
CHECK MEN ONLY INDEED 
BOTH KELLEHER AND RYAN SERVED TIME UNDER READING AT HORTON PRISON 
GOVERNOR ON LANDING 
WE FOUND THESE IN YOUR CELL KELLEHER CARDS 
CARDS SIR SIR 
WHAT'S THIS OH THAT'S A TWINK 
SIR 
CLEAR THE WING 
MOVE 
COME ON 
LET'S HAVE YOU BACK 
ARGH YOU BASTARD 
WELL I CALL IT LOSS OF PRIVILEGES 
SIX DAYS IN SEGREGATION TAKE HIM 
I'LL HAVE YOU READING IS THAT A THREAT 
I'LL BE OUTSIDE IN A MONTH 
IT'S THE END OF MY TARIFF AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT 
MATE ONE OFF 
TWO OFF WHERE ARE YOU GOING RYAN 
WITH HIM 
YOU DO ONE OF US YOU BETTER DO US BOTH 
I GET OUT IN A FEW WEEKS AS WELL 
MATE 
TAKE THE TWO OF THEM DOWN TWO OFF 
WHY DID THE ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION FOCUS ON THESE TWO 
SEVERAL PRISON WARDERS WITNESSED KELLEHER AND RYAN MAKING 
A VERY PUBLIC THREAT TO READING JUST BEFORE THEIR RELEASE IN TWO THOUSAND 
AND AFTER THE MURDER THEY WERE BOTH CAUGHT DESECRATING READING'S GRAVE 
HOW ERM 
DEFECATION THEY SHAT ON IT 
BUT THEY HAD TO RELEASE THEM BECAUSE THEY HAD NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE TO PLACE THEM AT THE MURDER SCENE 
PLUS THEY BOTH HAD ALIBIS FOR THE TIME OF THE MURDER FROM WHERE 
THEY WERE LIVING IN RUTLAND PARK IT'S A HALFWAY HOUSE 
THE SUPERVISOR PAUL OWENS MADE A SWORN STATEMENT THAT THEY WERE WATCHING T. V. ALL THAT NIGHT 
I'LL GET IT 
SO THEIR ALIBI JUST HANGS ON THIS ONE GUY YEAH AND HE'S OBVIOUSLY AN EX CON 
GRACE FOLEY YEAH HE HAD A PREVIOUS CONVICTION FOR SEXUALLY ABUSING OLD FOLKS IN A NURSING HOME 
CATHY READING'S HERE I'LL TAKE IT IN MY OFFICE O. K. 
KELLEHER IS NOW BACK INSIDE HORTON PRISON SENTENCED TO LIFE LAST YEAR FOR RAPE AND MURDER AGAIN 
THIS TIME OF A MALE TAXI DRIVER FATHER OF FOUR 
SO THIS CORPSE THEY TOOK THE HEAD OFF HERE FOR WHAT REASON FOR A TROPHY OR I DON'T KNOW 
SO IT COULD GO WITH THESE OTHER TROPHIES IN THE SUITCASE 
I DON'T KNOW BUT THEN WHY DID THEY THROW THEM IN THE RIVER MAYBE THEY WERE INTERCEPTED 
MAYBE IT WASN'T A REVENGE KILLING AT ALL THEY WANTED TO COVER UP THE CAUSE OF DEATH 
AND WAS THERE CROSS CONTAMINATION AT THE SCENE 
NO CROSS CONTAMINATION AT ALL 
THERE'S NO D. N. A. NOTHING NO D. N. A. NOTHING 
THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY ISN'T IT 
AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GET FROM HERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET ANYTHING 
D. N. A. POSSIBLY 
THEY'VE BEEN SUBMERGED FOR SEVEN YEARS SO 
I'M GOING TO CHECK OUT OWENS'S STORY SEE IF IT STANDS UP 
AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO FIND RYAN YEAH 
SURE I'LL DEAL WITH THIS 
MEN ONLY MAN 
SIR YEAH 
CATHY READING 
YEAH THANK YOU 
THANKS THIS IS D. S. I. BOYD HELLO 
AND D. C. STELLA GOODMAN HELLO 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT UM DOCTOR FOLEY HAS TOLD YOU BUT WE'RE RE OPENING THE CASE INTO YOUR FATHER'S MURDER 
RIGHT 
AND WE WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU HAD ANY NEW THOUGHTS 
ABOUT ANYBODY THAT COULD'VE HAD ANIMOSITY TOWARDS YOUR FATHER 
NO NO MY FATHER WAS A HIGHLY RESPECTED MAN 
WHY ARE YOU REOPENING THE CASE NOW 
WE HAVE UM NEW EVIDENCE 
WHAT KIND OF NEW EVIDENCE 
WE'VE FOUND YOUR FATHER'S HEAD 
I SEE 
EXCUSE ME NO WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS NOW 
STELLA CAN YOU TAKE CATHY HOME AND STAY WITH HER 
THANK YOU WHY ARE YOU SENDING HER HOME 
YOU COULD JUST PUT HER IN ANOTHER ROOM FOR FIVE MINUTES GOD YOU CAN BE SO INSENSITIVE 
IT'S A STRANGE WAY TO DESCRIBE YOUR FATHER DON'T YOU THINK 
HIGHLY RESPECTED YEAH 
YES 
WHERE WERE YOU BETWEEN SEVEN P. M. AND TWELVE MIDNIGHT ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER 
WELL IT'S LIKE I TOLD THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE 
KELLEHER AND RYAN 
WERE TUCKED UP HERE IN FRONT OF THE TELLY ALL NIGHT 
WHAT WERE THEY WATCHING 
I THINK THEY WERE HAVING A STAR WARS NIGHT 
YOU KNOW WATCH ALL OF THEM IN ONE GO YOU THINK 
YEAH I THOUGHT YOU SAID IN YOUR ORIGINAL STATEMENT THAT YOU WERE WITH THEM IN HERE ALL NIGHT 
I SAID I WAS IN THE HOUSE ALL NIGHT 
SO YOU WEREN'T IN THIS ROOM NO I WAS IN MY OWN ROOM 
IT'S AT THE FRONT SO NO ONE CAN COME IN AND OUT WITHOUT ME KNOWING IT 
IT'S GOT A BUZZER ON THE DOOR 
SO CAN YOU GET IN AND OUT FROM THE BACK OF THE HOUSE I SUPPOSE CAN I SEE IT 
THIS WAY THEN 
IT'S NOT VERY SECURE IS IT IT'S NOT A PRISON 
THE LAST SEVEN YEARS AND DID YOU ACTUALLY WITNESS KELLEHER MAKING A THREAT TO GOVERNOR READING 
I WROTE IT IN MY LOG AT THE TIME I WOULDN'T WANT THIS TO BE TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT SIR WHAT CONTEXT 
PRISONERS MAKE THREATS TO STAFF ALL THE TIME 
THERE ISN'T A WEEK GOES BY WHERE SOMEONE HASN'T LOGGED ONE 
SO YOU DON'T THINK THAT KELLEHER DID IT I DIDN'T SAY THAT 
O. K. WELL DO YOU THINK HE DID IT 
I THINK HE'S A VERY DANGEROUS PREDATOR AND HE'S CAPABLE 
BUT THEN SO IS EVERY PRISONER THAT COMES THROUGH HERE 
WHAT'S HE LIKE AS A PERSON 
YEAH I MEAN YOU MUST KNOW HIM PRETTY WELL BY NOW 
NO I DON'T KNOW HIM WELL YOU SPENT YEARS WORKING WITH HIM HERE 
ER HOW DO I PUT THIS 
A WARDER NEVER GETS TO KNOW A PRISONER 
ALL THEY EVER LET US SEE IS WHAT THEY WANT US TO SEE BACK TO WORK 
WHY DID THEY PUT YOU IN THE SEX OFFENDERS' WING WHAT ARE YOU BAIT 
I BEG YOUR PARDON IT'S LIKE PUTTING A CANARY IN WITH A CAT 
REHABILITATION BOYD YEAH DID IT WORK FOR KELLEHER HE IS WHAT WE CALL A MODEL PRISONER 
HE OBEYS THE RULES HE THRIVES IN THE SYSTEM CAN WE SEE HIM NOW 
COURSE THIS WAY 
O. K. SO HAS HE RAPED ANYBODY WHILE HE'S BEEN IN HERE PROBABLY 
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS TEND TO GO UNREPORTED 
SO YOU WOULDN'T RECOMMEND HIM FOR EARLY RELEASE 
NO BUT THEN IN HIS CASE IT'S NOT A PROBLEM 
HE'LL DIE IN HERE 
PROSTATE CANCER HOW LONG'S HE GOT 
A FEW MONTHS KELLEHER 
VISITORS 
I ALMOST WANT TO ADMIT TO DOING IT 
BUT THAT WOULD JUST TAKE THE CREDIT AWAY FROM THE MAN WHO REALLY DID DO IT 
A MAN FOR WHOM I HAVE NOTHING BUT ADMIRATION 
SO YOU KNOW WHO KILLED GOVERNOR READING 
WELL I PREFER TO CALL READING PIGFACE BUT NO 
I DON'T KNOW WHO DID IT 
AND IF I DID YOU'D NEVER TELL ME I'D GIVE HIM A MEDAL 
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY WE CALLED HIM PIGFACE TELL ME 
IT'S BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS BEATING YOU HIS NOSTRILS WOULD FLARE OPEN LIKE A PIG'S SNOUT

HAVE YOU FOUND HIS HEAD YET 
DO YOU KNOW WHERE TERRY RYAN IS

MOST ARE CAUGHT AGAIN BUT THERE'S ALWAYS ONE OR TWO WHO STAY GONE 
YOU KNOW NO ONE SHOULD BE SURPRISED THAT ONE OF READING'S PRISONERS KILLED HIM WHY 
READING WAS A MONSTER 
AND I DON'T MEAN SOMEONE WHO JUST LIKED TO DISH OUT PUNISHMENT 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN EXACTLY 
I MEAN WHEN HE GOT YOU ALONE

DOCTOR HOOPER SAYS THAT I'M CATEGORY C. I DON'T NEED CUFFING 
YOU MIGHT HAVE PULLED THE WOOL OVER HIS EYES BUT NOT MINE COME ON 
BUT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN SENTENCED TO LIFE FOR RAPE AND MURDER 
AND NOW BACK IN HORTON PRISON 
YOU ALL RIGHT SPENCE YEAH YEAH YEAH 
HOW WAS OWENS HUH CRAZY MOTHER 
THERE'S NOTHING SECURE ABOUT THAT HALFWAY HOUSE 
AN ARMY COULD'VE PASSED THROUGH AND THAT IDIOT WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN IT SO WE CAN DISMISS THESE TWO ALIBIS 
WE CAN COMPLETELY 
HERE'S A PICTURE OF OWENS 
ALL RIGHT STELLA NO 
I WAS WITH CATHY READING WHEN HOOPER STORMED IN AND TOLD ME I HAD TO GO OUT 
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO BITE MY HEAD OFF YOU MEAN HE WAS VIOLENT 
NO BUT HE GRABBED THE PICTURE OF THEIR DAUGHTER THEY HAVE A CHILD 
YEAH AND HOW OLD IS THAT CHILD I DON'T KNOW FIVE ISH AND THEN TOLD ME I NEEDED A WARRANT 
GET ON TO THE RECORDS OFFICE I NEED TO KNOW THE AGE OF THAT CHILD EXACTLY O. K. I'LL GET ONTO IT 
A GOOD DAY SO FAR YEAH WELL I THOUGHT OWENS WAS BAD ENOUGH AND THEN I MET RYAN 
HE'S A NUTTER 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY A NUTTER WELL IF YOU WANT TO BE TECHNICAL COMPLETELY INSANE 
THE HAIRS ARE STILL STANDING ON THE BACK OF MY NECK WHY WHAT HAPPENED 
AH WELL I'LL COME TO THAT LET ME JUST DEAL WITH OWENS FIRST 
NOW HE SAID THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN AT THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT A PAUL JACKSON 
HE WAS A PERSON OF INTEREST WITH THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION BUT 
WHEN THEY WENT TO INTERVIEW HIM HE WENT MISSING 
SO I CHECKED WITH THE PROTECTION AGENCY AND HE'S STILL ON THE MISSING LIST 
DID HE SERVE TIME UNDER READING SIX YEARS HE'S A RAPIST 
HE ALSO FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST READING WHAT FOR BEATINGS CRUELTY 
BUT HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE THERE WERE AT LEAST HALF A DOZEN SEX OFFENDERS 
WHO CAME OUT OF HORTON THAT HAVE GONE MISSING IN THE PAST FEW YEARS THEY LOST TRACK OF SIX 
THEY'VE GOT TENS OF THOUSANDS TO KEEP TRACK OF 
THE ONUS IS ON THE OFFENDERS TO REGISTER AND IF THEY DON'T 
THEN THERE'S NOT MUCH THEY CAN DO TO STOP THEM GOING TO GROUND 
WELL PULL THE FILES ON THESE MISSING GUYS HERE AND SEE IF WE CAN TRACK THIS PAUL JACKSON 
O. K. ALL RIGHT SO RYAN KELLEHER OWENS JACKSON SHE'S NEARLY SIX 
SIX JULIE READING 
BORN FOURTEENTH OF JUNE TWO THOUSAND TWO 
MOTHER CATHERINE READING FATHER 
FATHER UNKNOWN 
SHE GAVE BIRTH EIGHT MONTHS AFTER HER FATHER DIED SO SHE WAS PREGNANT WHEN HE WAS MURDERED 
O. K. SO CATHY WAS EIGHTEEN LIVING WITH HOOPER 
WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE BOND 
SO HOOPER COULD BE THE FATHER AND HE COULD BE THE DISGRUNTLED FATHER IN LAW 
WELL HE WAS VERY AGGRESSIVE IN HIS DEFENCE OF CATHY 
AND DEFENSIVE ABOUT JULIE AGGRESSIVE DEFENSIVE IS A GOOD PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION 
I MEAN THAT'S ENOUGH REASON TO GET YOURSELF UP ON THE BOARD YEAH REASONABLE SUSPECT HOOPER O. K. 
SO WHAT WAS IT ABOUT RYAN YOU WERE GOING TO SAY 
RYAN RYAN WELL HE SAYS OR HE'S CONVINCED THAT PIKE DID IT 
PIKE WHO THE HELL IS PIKE 
JONATHAN PIKE HE'S THE SENIOR PRISON OFFICER ON KELLEHER'S WING 
A PRISON OFFICER YEAH BUT IT DIDN'T SOUND VERY PLAUSIBLE 
WHY WELL RYAN SAID THAT HE HEARD PIKE TALKING TO A. 
BEAST A MONSTER 
I CAN SEE THE CREDIBILITY GOING OUT THE WINDOW STRAIGHT AWAY 
NO NO WAIT WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY ABOUT IT 
WELL RYAN WAS BEING BEATEN AT THE TIME SO YOU KNOW 
WELL YOU SEE YOU SEE THERE'S A PRISONER TWENTY FOUR HOURS SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IN A STATE OF TRAUMA 
HALLUCINATIONS ARE A WAY OF PROCESSING REALITY 
SO THERE COULD BE SOMETHING IN IT OF COURSE O. K. MR. PIKE 
YOU'RE GOING UP 
RIGHT PIKE 
INTERPERSONAL I MEAN READING WAS HIS BOSS COULD'VE BEEN A PROBLEM WITH THAT 
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR PEOPLE TO WANT TO KILL THEIR BOSS 
SOMETIMES 
YEAH 
HI IT'S EVE CAN YOU COME TO THE RECONSTRUCTION UNIT 
I'VE GOT SOMETHING I WANT TO SHOW YOU ALL CERTAINLY 
O. K. 
I NEED TO GO 
IT CAN WAIT PIKE I'VE GOT A PROSTATE THE SIZE OF A WATERMELON 
AND IT'S SQUEEZING MY BLADDER TO THE SIZE OF A GOLF BALL SO EVEN IF I WANTED TO WAIT I CAN'T 
HI 
HI HI EVE 
THIS IS JIMMY THE DUMMY 
TONIGHT HE'LL BE PLAYING THE PART OF OUR MURDER VICTIM JAMES READING 
HE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT TO ACTUAL SIZE 
THE FACTS ARE THE FACTS JIMMY AND I WILL HELP FILL IN THE GAPS 
SO RIGHT 
YOU ARE NOW IN THE MURDER ROOM 
STAY AT THE DOOR 
GET ON WITH IT 
I NEED TO GO IN THERE I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU JUST NEEDED TO EMPTY YOUR BLADDER 
I HAVE TO SIT DOWN BECAUSE MY URINARY TRACT IS COMPRESSED DO YOU NEED A MAP 
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO SCUBA DIVE DOWN THE TOILET 
OWING TO THE LACK OF DEFENCE WOUNDS ON THE VICTIM'S BODY I'M ASSUMING HE DIDN'T SEE THE ATTACK 
COMING WHICH IN TURN LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE FIRST BLOW WAS TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD 
USING THIS TROPHY A NON FATAL GLANCING BLOW FROM BEHIND LIKE 
YOU CAN WATCH IF YOU LIKE BUT IT WON'T BE PRETTY 
THE ANGLES OF THE TWO SUBSEQUENT BLOWS TELL US THAT THE KILLER MUST'VE KNELT BESIDE THE VICTIM 
LIKE THIS AND DELIVERED TWO MUCH MORE FEROCIOUS KILLING BLOWS 
TO THE FRONT OF THE HEAD LIKE THIS 
CAUSING A MASSIVE HAEMORRHAGE 
JIMMY IS NOW DEAD 
THE KILLER MOVES INTO THE KITCHEN 
WHERE THEY FIND THESE 
RIGHT BUT THERE'S NO CROSS CONTAMINATION 
FROM THE KILLER IS THERE THERE'S NONE OF THE KILLER'S D. N. A. OR FIBRES 
NO NO BECAUSE ALSO RATHER BRILLIANTLY IN THE KITCHEN 
THE KILLER FINDS THESE RUBBER GLOVES AND SOME PLASTIC BIN BAGS 
THE KILLER PUTS ONE BIN BAG FOR EACH LEG ONE FOR EACH ARM FOR THE TORSO 
ON THE HEAD AND THEN SEALS OFF THE WHOLE THING WITH TAPE 
FROM THIS POINT ON THE KILLER IS FORENSICALLY INVISIBLE 
YOU O. K. IN THERE 
NO I NEED SOME HELP 
DON'T THINK FOR ONE MINUTE THAT I WON'T OPEN UP YOUR NECK 
TAKE IT EASY NOW TAKE IT EASY 
NO NO NO YOU TAKE IT EASY 
CALM DOWN BACK UP BACK UP 
KNEEL DOWN KNEEL DOWN THERE YOU GO DOWN DOWN DOWN 
SEE THE PIPE CUFF YOURSELF TO IT GO ON 
RIGHT GOOD BOY GO ON 
NICE AND EASY NOW 
WELL DONE WELL DONE 
SWEET DREAMS YOU BASTARD 
THE ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION FOUND MARKS ON THE REMAINING NECK TISSUE 
SUGGESTING STRANGULATION BUT THE LUNGS DIDN'T SUPPORT THAT THEORY 
WHAT I PROPOSE IS THAT THE KILLER USED THE VICTIM'S OWN TIE 
AS A TOURNIQUET 
TO STAUNCH THE FLOW OF BLOOD 
ENABLING THEM TO USE THIS TO CUT INTO THE FLESH 
CONTROLLING THE BLOOD 
ENABLES ME TO GET A GOOD VISUAL OF MY WORK 
I CAN PULL BACK THE SOFT TISSUE 
UNTIL I REACH THE VERTEBRAE 
AND THEN USE THIS 
OOH 
TO FINISH OFF THE JOB 
IS EVERYTHING O. K. 
THE BALL'S IN YOUR COURT NOW OH YES 
IT IS 
AS YOU CAN SEE MY WORKPLACE IS STILL RELATIVELY TIDY 
ANY BLOOD THAT IS PRESENT IS FROM THE HEAD AND NOT FROM THE BODY 
I PUT IT IN A PLASTIC BAG CONTAIN IT PUT IT IN THE SUITCASE 
WITH THESE 
AND NOW I RELEASE THE PRESSURE ON THE TOURNIQUET SO THAT 
THAT IS ONE COOL HEADED PERSON 
AND THIS IS THE SCENE THAT THE ORIGINAL INVESTIGATING TEAM WALKED INTO 
COME HERE GET BACK 
YES HAVE THOSE 
COME ON 
THE INITIAL ATTEMPT WAS IMPULSIVE THEY USED WHICHEVER WEAPON CAME TO HAND WHICH 
IN THIS CASE WAS THE TROPHY SO DID THEY GO INTO THE ROOM WITH THE INTENTION OF KILLING READING 
THAT IS THE ANOMALY HERE 
IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE BEHAVIOUR WAS TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL 
THOSE THREE FEROCIOUS BLOWS YEAH ONE TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD TWO TO THE FRONT 
READING'S A BIG GUY NOBODY'S GOING TO TAKE HIM ON FROM THE FRONT 
EXACTLY YEAH BUT AFTER THE KILL TOTALLY DIFFERENT BEHAVIOUR PATTERN 
PRECISE CONTROLLED PLANNED 
WHAT SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE COULD BE TWO PEOPLE INVOLVED 
WELL YES THERE COULD BE 
I MEAN THERE'S DEFINITELY A SWITCH 
OR IT COULD BE SOMEBODY SUFFERING FROM DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER 
O. K. IN LAYMAN'S TERMS MULTIPLE PERSONALITY DISORDER O. K. LET'S GET HOOPER IN ALL RIGHT 
GOOD IDEA I MEAN EVEN IF HE'S NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED YOU KNOW HE'S GOT EVERY REASON TO BE 
HE KNOWS THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THESE GUYS AND HE MIGHT SAY YOU KNOW 
GUESS WHAT ONE OF THEM ACTUALLY SUFFERS FROM DIS DISSOCIATIVE DID 
DID WHAT 
O. K. WELL 
YEAH THANK YOU GET THE SECURITY FOOTAGE OVER TO OUR COMPUTER WILL YOU PLEASE 
THANK YOU 
THEY TOOK KELLEHER TO HOSPITAL 
AND HE'S ESCAPED FROM THERE WITH A PRISON OFFICER 
LINDA CUMMINGS 
HELLO DOC OH MY GOD

HOW DID YOU FIND ME 
OH SHE'S VERY PRETTY ISN'T SHE
