BUT IT OFFERS A UNIQUE WINDOW ON TO LIFE AT THE HEIGHT OF THE MIDDLE AGES 
AND HIDDEN WITHIN IT ARE TANTALISING CLUES AS TO ITS ORIGINS 
I'M GOING TO BE USING THIS MAP TO TRAVEL THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF BRITAIN 
THIS TIME I'M EXPLORING THE MOST MYSTERIOUS REGION ON THE WHOLE MAP MEDIEVAL SCOTLAND 
A NATION SO YOUNG IT STILL HAD NO CAPITAL 
WHERE WOLVES REIGNED OVER ITS HIGHLAND WILDERNESS 
AND GANGSTERS TERRORISED ITS BORDER LANDS 
MY JOURNEY BEGINS JUST OFF THE WILD EAST COAST OF SCOTLAND 
I'M HEADING FIVE MILES OUT FROM THE FIRTH OF FORTH 
INTO THE UNPREDICTABLE WATERS OF THE NORTH SEA TO A TINY ISLAND 
TODAY IT'S JUST A FORTY FIVE MINUTE TRIP BUT THE TIDAL CURRENTS 
AND NOTORIOUSLY STORMY SEAS MADE THIS A DAUNTING TRIP FOR THE MEDIEVAL TRAVELLER 
THIS MIGHT SEEM AN OBSCURE PLACE TO START BUT STRANGELY IT'S ONE OF THE FEW SCOTTISH LANDMARKS 
THAT YOU CAN CLEARLY IDENTIFY ON THE MEDIEVAL MAP 
SCOTLAND IS UNRECOGNISABLE 
NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN DRAWN ON ITS SIDE BUT EVEN WHEN YOU TURN THE MAP AROUND 
YOU ONLY KNOW IT'S MEANT TO BE SCOTLAND WHEN YOU SEE IT TOGETHER WITH ENGLAND AND WALES 
AND COMPARED TO ENGLAND THERE IS HARDLY ANY DETAIL 
ALL OF WHICH INDICATES THAT THIS WAS A MAP MADE IN ENGLAND 
WHEN THIS MAP WAS MADE SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND HAD BEEN AT WAR ON AND OFF FOR GENERATIONS 
SO FOR THE ENGLISH MAPMAKER THESE WERE UNKNOWN UNCHARTED LANDS 
BUT WHAT IS FASCINATING IS WHAT HE HAS PUT ON 
ONE THING THAT REALLY JUMPS OUT IS THIS THE ISLE OF MAY 
BUT ON THE MAP IT'S AT LEAST TEN TIMES TOO BIG 
BUT WHY IS AN ISLAND BARELY A MILE LONG GIVEN SUCH PROMINENCE 
THE MAP ONLY OFFERS ONE CLUE A SINGLE BUILDING WITH A SPIRE 
AND SURE ENOUGH THERE ARE MEDIEVAL RUINS HERE 
THE REMAINS OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY MONASTERY BUILT ON THE SITE OF THE GRAVE OF SAINT ADRIAN OF FIFE 
A MISSIONARY WHO WAS SLAUGHTERED BY VIKING RAIDERS AFTER FOUNDING ONE OF THE FIRST CHURCHES OF SCOTLAND 
IT BECAME A POPULAR PILGRIMAGE SITE DESPITE WHAT'S OFTEN A TREACHEROUS SEA CROSSING 
IN FACT THIS MAY HAVE ADDED TO ITS ATTRACTION 
FOR MEDIEVAL PILGRIMS THE MORE GRUELLING OR DANGEROUS THE JOURNEY THE GREATER THE SPIRITUAL BENEFIT 
BUT THE MONASTERY ALONE MAY NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ISLAND 
BY THE TIME THE GOUGH MAP WAS DRAWN THIS PLACE HAD BEEN ABANDONED FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS 
SO IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE ABBEY ALONE WARRANTED THE PROMINENCE OF THE ISLAND ON THE MAP 
MORE LIKELY IT'S WHAT HAD SUSTAINED THE MONKS AND THEIR ABBEY WHILE THEY WERE HERE 
RECORDS SHOW THAT THE MONKS HAD SURVIVED BY COLLECTING TITHES AND TAXES 
FROM SHIPS THAT HAD CALLED AT THE NEARBY COASTAL TOWNS OF PITTENWEEM ANSTRUTHER AND CRAIL IN FIFE 
THESE WATERS WERE ON A MAJOR MEDIEVAL SHIPPING ROUTE ATTRACTING VESSELS FROM ALL OVER EUROPE 
FOR A ONCE PROUD INDUSTRY THAT'S NOW ALL BUT DISAPPEARED 
AND WHAT ATTRACTED PEOPLE HERE WAS THIS FISH 
A RECORD OF THE TIMES STATES THAT 
FISH ARE FOUND IN SUCH GREAT ABUNDANCE THAT FROM EVERY SHORE OF THE SEA FROM ENGLAND SCOTLAND 
AND EVEN FROM BELGIUM AND FRANCE VERY MANY FISHERMEN COME HERE FOR THE SAKE OF FISHING 
THEY CAME TO FISH AND TO TRADE IN FISH 
THE MODEST TOWN OF CRAIL WAS THEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST FISH MARKETS 
NOT JUST IN SCOTLAND BUT IN THE WHOLE OF MEDIEVAL EUROPE 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE GOUGH MAP 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S STRIKING ABOUT THE SORT OF SCOTTISH END OF IT 
IS THAT IT'S REALLY DOMINATED BY THE NORTH SEA 
AND EVEN ALONG THE TOP EDGE OF THE MAP CONTINENTAL COUNTRIES NORWAY DENMARK FRANCE 
AND THERE ARE THREE FISH SWIMMING IN THE SEA 
WHICH POINT TO THE FACT THAT THE NORTH SEA WAS BOTH A THOROUGHFARE 
IT WAS A THING THAT CONNECTED THEM TO SCANDINAVIA AND FRANCE 
AND ALSO HOW THEY EARNED THEIR LIVING HOW THEY FILLED THEIR BELLIES WITH THIS DELICIOUS FISH 
THE ISLE OF MAY WOULD HAVE BEEN A WELL KNOWN LANDMARK TO SAILORS FROM ALL OVER EUROPE 
BUT THE MAP WOULD HAVE BEEN OF NO USE AS A MARITIME CHART BECAUSE THE COASTLINE IS SO INACCURATE 
THE ISLAND WHICH SITS AT THE MOUTH OF THE FIRTH OF FORTH IS DEPICTED WAY OUT IN THE NORTH SEA 
AND KEY PORTS LIKE CRAIL AREN'T EVEN MARKED 
INLAND TOO THE MAP WOULD HAVE BEEN OF NO PRACTICAL USE TO THE OVERLAND TRAVELLER 
FEW SCOTTISH TOWNS ARE IDENTIFIED AND THERE ISN'T A SINGLE ROUTE SHOWN 
IN THE HEART OF THE HIGHLANDS WHAT IS REALLY STRIKING ARE THE MOUNTAINS 
FIFTEEN MOUNTAIN ICONS ARE SHOWN AS WELL AS A FORBIDDING MOUNTAIN BARRIER STRETCHING FROM COAST TO COAST 
THE ENGLISH MAPMAKER HAS DRAWN A HOSTILE AND IMPENETRABLE WILDERNESS INHABITED BY TERRIFYING BEASTS 
MADDENED BY GREED THEY KILL WHATEVER THEY FIND 
THEY GET THEIR NAME FROM THEIR RAPACITY 
THEY LIVE ON PREY ON EARTH AND EVEN ON THE WIND 
WOLVES KNOWN AND FEARED THROUGHOUT MEDIEVAL BRITAIN 
THE MAP DULY REGISTERS A WARNING HIC HABUNDANT LUPI 
MANY WOLVES LIVE HERE 
IT'S STRIKING THAT IN A BRITISH CONTEXT 
THE NORTHERN HIGHLANDS MAY WELL HAVE BEEN PERCEIVED FOR MANY YEARS AS A WILDERNESS 
AN AREA THAT WAS ALMOST UNTOUCHABLE UNTAMEABLE 
AND THE WOLF WOULD AGAIN HAVE BEEN A SYMBOL OF THAT WILDNESS 
BUT IF YOU GO BACK IN HISTORY THE WOLF HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE EMBODIMENT OF EVIL REALLY 
THAT MAY WELL HAVE COME FROM THE WOLVES TENDENCY TO DIG UP DEAD BODIES 
AND OF COURSE AS MAN STARTED TO IMPACT ON THE WOLVES HABITAT 
IT BECAME QUITE DESPERATE AND COULD WELL HAVE TURNED ITS ATTENTION TO HUMANS AND VIEWED THEM AS PREY 
AND THAT WOULD HAVE FUELLED FEAR AND HATRED ON THE PART OF GOD FEARING PEOPLE IN THOSE DAYS HMM 
INHERENTLY WE HAVE THIS SUSPICION IF YOU LIKE OF THE WOLF 
AND PERHAPS MORE OF WHAT IT SYMBOLISES RATHER THAN WHAT IT IS 
MEDIEVAL PEOPLE BELIEVED EACH ANIMAL HAD A SYMBOLIC MEANING 
IN THE NATURAL WORLD GOD HAD LAID DOWN A COMPLETE MORAL CODE FOR HUMAN KIND 
REVEALED THROUGH THE CHARACTER AND HABITS OF ALL HIS CREATURES 
THESE INTERPRETATIONS WERE SET OUT IN A MEDIEVAL BOOK CALLED THE BESTIARY 
ACCORDING TO THE BESTIARY THE WOLF WAS NOT ONLY A SAVAGE PREDATOR 
IT WAS ALSO EVIL THE EMBODIMENT OF THE DEVIL HIMSELF 
WITH EYES THAT SHONE LIKE LANTERNS AND THE POWER TO STRIKE MEN DUMB WITH ITS GAZE 
WOLVES WERE DEPICTED AS RAPACIOUS BEASTS CRAVING BLOOD 
JUST LIKE THE DEVIL THEY CIRCLED THE SHEEPFOLD OF THE FAITHFUL INTENT ON DESTROYING THEIR SOULS 
THE RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE SHOULD YOU BE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO RUN IN TO A WILD WOLF 
IS A LITTLE BIT SURPRISING 
THE BESTIARY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU STRIP OFF ALL YOUR CLOTHES 
PLACE THEM IN A PILE ON THE GROUND AND THEN STAND ON TOP OF THEM WHILE BANGING TWO STONES TOGETHER 
AND THE WOLF RECOGNISING THE RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM OF WHAT YOU'VE JUST DONE 
WILL HEAD OFF IN TO THE FOREST 
CASTING OFF YOUR CLOTHES REVEALED YOUR SIN WHILE THE NOISE OF THE STONES WOULD SUMMON THE APOSTLES 
AND WITH THE LORD ON YOUR SIDE THE DEVILISH BEAST COULD BE DEFEATED 
ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN DEATH AND THE DEVIL LED WOLVES TO BE HUNTED MERCILESSLY IN MEDIEVAL BRITAIN 
AND BY THE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED'S THEY WERE EXTINCT 
HEADING BACK SOUTH FROM THE WILD HIGHLANDS TOWARDS THE LOWLANDS 
I PASS THE ONLY LOCH CLEARLY MARKED ON THE MAP LOCH TAY 
AN INSCRIPTION DESCRIBES A FLOATING ISLAND 
FISH WITHOUT INTESTINES AND A PASSAGE WITHOUT WIND 
WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE MAPMAKER IS RELYING ON HEARSAY RATHER THAN FIRST HAND GEOGRAPHIC KNOWLEDGE 
THE FERTILE LOWLANDS OF SCOTLAND WERE WHERE THE WEALTH AND POWER LAY 
IN EARLY MEDIEVAL TIMES THE SCOTTISH KING WAS THE NOMINAL HEAD OF A LOOSE ASSOCIATION OF CLANS 
THIS MADE SCOTLAND VULNERABLE TO ATTACK FROM THE ENGLISH 
AND ONE TOWN MORE THAN ANY OTHER PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN UNITING SCOTLAND IN TO A SINGLE NATION 
STIRLING 
MEDIEVAL STIRLING WAS QUITE A BUSTLING TOWN 
BROAD STREET HERE WAS HOME TO THE LOCAL MARKET WHICH WAS HEAVING WITH GOODS PRODUCED IN THIS 
ONE OF SCOTLAND'S MOST FERTILE REGIONS AND ALSO WITH LUXURY GOODS IMPORTED FROM OVERSEAS 
STIRLING WAS STRATEGICALLY LOCATED WITH ITS CASTLE TOWERING ABOVE THE LANDSCAPE 
THE MAPMAKER BELIEVED SCOTLAND WAS CUT IN TWO BY THE FIRTH OF FORTH 
AND SHOWS THE BRIDGE AT STIRLING AS THE ONLY CROSSING POINT 
HE WAS WRONG ON THE DETAIL BUT RIGHT ABOUT THE BRIDGE'S IMPORTANCE 
WHOEVER HELD IT COULD CONTROL ALL OF SCOTLAND 
THE ONLY BIT OF THE MEDIEVAL CASTLE THAT SURVIVES IS THIS GATEHOUSE BUILT IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
THE REST WAS DESTROYED DURING LONG AND BITTER WARS AGAINST ENGLISH DOMINATION 
THIS CASTLE SAW SEVERAL MAJOR TURNING POINTS IN SCOTLAND'S HISTORY 
FROM HERE YOU CAN SEE MEDIEVAL BATTLEGROUNDS WHOSE NAMES LIE AT THE HEART OF SCOTTISH NATIONAL IDENTITY 
OVER THERE WILLIAM WALLACE LED HIS MEN TO VICTORY AT THE BATTLE OF STIRLING BRIDGE 
AND OVER THERE BANNOCKBURN THE SITE OF ROBERT THE BRUCE'S GREAT TRIUMPH 
BANNOCKBURN WAS THE DEFINING MOMENT IN THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE 
ROBERT THE BRUCE ROUTED THE LARGER ENGLISH ARMY 
FORCING THE KING HIMSELF EDWARD THE SECOND TO FLEE THE FIELD OF BATTLE 
THE VICTORY PAVED THE WAY FOR SCOTLAND'S RECOGNITION AS A SOVEREIGN STATE 
EVER SINCE THE NAME OF BANNOCKBURN HAS BEEN SYNONYMOUS WITH SCOTTISH PRIDE 
WITH THE DEFEAT OF THE ENGLISH INVADERS THE SCOTTISH ROYAL COURT FLOURISHED AT CASTLES LIKE STIRLING 
WHERE SOME OF THEIR FINEST POSSESSIONS ARE NOW BEING PAINSTAKINGLY RECREATED 
WELL IT'S A TWELVE YEAR PROJECT TO WEAVE SEVEN TAPESTRIES FOR STIRLING CASTLE 
WE LOOKED AT THE INVENTORIES OF JAMES V. TO SEE WHAT HE HAD IN HIS COLLECTION AT THAT PERIOD OF TIME 
AND WE KNOW FROM THAT HE HAD WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED TAPESTRIES IN HIS COLLECTION OH RIGHT 
TAPESTRY AT THE TIME WAS THE PAINTING OF THE DAY REALLY IT WAS THE HIGHEST ART FORM YOU COULD HAVE 
THE MORE SILK AND GOLD THEY HAD THEN THE RICHER THE MORE WEALTHY THEY WERE 
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE SOMETHING LIKE THE MASSIVE TAPESTRY THAT WE SEE BEHIND US 
THAT'S TAKEN THREE YEARS FOUR MONTHS TO WEAVE 
UM THAT'S A TEAM OF THREE WEAVERS WORKING FULL TIME 
OH RIGHT SO WHAT ARE YOU BASING YOUR DESIGNS UPON 
UM AN ORIGINAL SET THAT'S NOW HOUSED IN THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF NEW YORK 
THEY'RE FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD UM THE SERIES IS CALLED THE HUNT OF THE UNICORN 
UM AND WE KNOW THERE WAS A SET WITHIN STIRLING CASTLE CALLED THE LIFE OF THE UNICORN 
DECORATING HIS CASTLE WITH SUCH SYMBOLS OF CHRISTIAN PURITY 
THE KING WAS ASSERTING HIS MORALITY AND SHOWING OFF HIS WEALTH 
AND JUST AS IMPORTANT TAPESTRIES WERE PORTABLE 
FOR THE KING AND HIS COURT WERE ITINERANT TRAVELLING CASTLE TO CASTLE 
BECAUSE MEDIEVAL SCOTLAND HAD NO PERMANENT CAPITAL 
AROUND THE TIME OF THE MAP SCOTLAND HAD FAR FEWER TOWNS THAN ENGLAND AND MOST WERE TINY 
ONLY FIVE HAD OVER ONE THOUSAND INHABITANTS 
AND WHILE EDINBURGH WAS BEGINNING TO EMERGE AS A SIGNIFICANT PORT 
GLASGOW HAD ONLY JUST GOT ON TO THE MEDIEVAL MAP 
HERE IN THE EAST END OF GLASGOW IS THE OLDEST SURVIVING CATHEDRAL IN MAINLAND SCOTLAND 
OBVIOUSLY IT WAS BUILT FOR THE GLORY OF GOD BUT THAT'S NOT ALL 
IT WAS ALSO BUILT FOR SCOTLAND 
VICTORIES OVER THE ENGLISH AT BANNOCKBURN AND STIRLING HAD INTENSIFIED SCOTTISH NATIONAL PRIDE 
BUT ITS SEEDS WERE SEWN MUCH EARLIER WITH THIS CATHEDRAL 
TO COUNTER THE INFLUENCE OF THE ENGLISH CHURCH DAVID I ONE OF SCOTLAND'S MOST INFLUENTIAL KINGS 
ESTABLISHED THIS CATHEDRAL IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX 
IN DOING SO HE MADE THE SCOTTISH CHURCH INDEPENDENT OF ENGLISH INFLUENCE 
IT WAS A TACTICAL MOVE AND A STATEMENT OF NATIONAL IDENTITY 
DAVID WAS TRYING TO BUILD A NEW SCOTLAND A STRONG AND INDEPENDENT NATION 
HE NEEDED A SELF GOVERNING CHURCH AND THIS TOWERING EDIFICE SYMBOLISED HIS AMBITION 
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BUILDING I THINK IT'S REMARKABLE HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO BUILD DO YOU KNOW 
THE WHOLE THING HERE IS PRETTY MUCH ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
BUT LIKE ANY GREAT CATHEDRAL CHURCH THERE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN A TIME 
WHEN THERE WASN'T THE SOUND OF MASONS BANGING AWAY 
AND WHEN THE KINGS OF SCOTS WERE CREATING THEIR UNIFIED KINGDOM IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY 
THEY WANTED TO CREATE A STRONG CENTRE OF CONTROL HERE 
ONE OF THE WAYS THEY COULD DO THAT WAS BY ESTABLISHING THE BISHOPRIC HERE 
IT WAS AN ENORMOUS BISHOPRIC IT WAS ONLY SECONDARY TO SAINT ANDREWS IN TERMS OF SCALE AND IMPORTANCE 
THIS CHURCH IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FEET LONG IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY ENORMOUS BUILDING 
TO LEND IT EVEN MORE STATUS 
IT WAS BUILT ON THE SITE OF THE SACRED TOMB OF THE REVERED SIXTH CENTURY MISSIONARY SAINT KENTIGERN 
THE RELICS THE CATHEDRAL POSSESSED OF SAINT KENTIGERN WERE THE MOST PRECIOUS OBJECTS THAT THEY HAD HERE 
THE BURIAL PLACE OF THE SAINT IS ON THE LOWER LEVEL DOWN BELOW US 
SO CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SAINT HERE 
KENTIGERN WAS CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE BISHOPS AND EVANGELISTS OF THE EARLY CHURCH 
HE WAS EFFECTIVELY THE PATRON SAINT OF THIS AREA OF SCOTLAND 
DIED IN SIX HUNDRED FOURTEEN AGED ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE WHICH WOW I THINK YOU'LL AGREE IS A BIT OF A MIRACLE IN ITSELF 
WHAT WAS HE TAKING WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LOTS OF MIRACLES DURING HIS OWN LIFETIME 
AND THEN OF COURSE MANY POSTHUMOUS MIRACLES AFTER HIS DEATH 
KING DAVID'S SCHEME WAS A MASTER STROKE 
AS EARLY AS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THE BISHOP OF GLASGOW HAD BEGUN REPORTING DIRECTLY TO ROME 
BYPASSING ANY ENGLISH INTERFERENCE 
FROM THEN ON THE BISHOP'S OF GLASGOW BECAME INCREASINGLY POWERFUL 
THIS IS THE OLDEST HOUSE IN GLASGOW 
IT'S KNOWN AS THE PROVAND'S LORDSHIP AND IT'S NEARLY AS OLD AS THE CATHEDRAL ITSELF 
IT WAS BUILT IN THE FOURTEEN HUNDRED'S BY THE BISHOP OF GLASGOW BUT NOT FOR PARTICULARLY RELIGIOUS PURPOSES 
THE HOUSE WAS PART OF A MEDIEVAL HOSPITAL FOR THE POOR 
AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY WAS JUST THIRTY AND THE MAIN WEAPONS AGAINST DISEASE 
WERE THE HERBS OF THE MEDIEVAL PHYSIC GARDEN LIKE THE ONE RECREATED IN THE GROUNDS HERE 
MEADOWSWEET IS THE HERB WE USE TO TREAT ACIDIC CONDITIONS IN THE BODY 
IT'S INTERESTING IT'S CALLED NATURE'S ASPIRIN 
BECAUSE IT HAS SALICYLIC ACID IN IT THE PHARMACEUTICAL NAME FOR ASPIRIN 
HERE WE HAVE LEMON BALM COMMONLY KNOWN AS MELISSA 
AND WE USE IT FOR ANXIETIES THAT SETTLE IN THE STOMACH AND THE HEAD 
DO THE MEDIEVAL USES FOR THESE HERBS TRANSLATE INTO MODERN PRACTICE 
WERE THEY RIGHT CAN YOU USE THESE YEAH THIS IS ELECAMPANE ROOT 
NOW THIS IS A VERY DRAMATIC HERB ABOVE THE GROUND 
IT'S A LONG HERB THAT GROWS AS TALL AS YOU AND I AND HAS THESE GREAT BIG LEAVES ON IT 
BUT IT'S THE ROOT WE USE IN MEDICINE 
AND THIS IS A REAL KIND OF GORGON'S HEAD OF ELECAMPANE ROOT 
IT WAS USED FOR PHLEGMATIC CONSUMPTIVE COUGH CONDITIONS LIKE T. B. 
THESE DAYS WE DON'T TREAT THOSE CONDITIONS SO MUCH BUT WE DO USE THIS HERB A LOT IN MODERN PRACTICE 
FOR CHRONIC BRONCHITISES THROUGH THE WINTERS A SCOTTISH HERB WE GET PHLEGMATIC DAMP CHESTS IN THE WINTER 
ELECAMPANE ROOT CAN BE USED EXTERNALLY IN A PLASTER TO TREAT NEURALGIAS SCIATICA REALLY 
THAT KIND OF THING AH SO POP YOUR WRIST DOWN 
AND THAT WOULD JUST BE BANDAGED AROUND A NEURALGIC LIMB 
AND HEAT WOULD BE APPLIED 
OH RIGHT EITHER BY A WARM STONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
AND THE HEAT WOULD HELP THE ACTUAL ELEMENTS TO GET IN TO THE TISSUE HMM 
HAVE A LITTLE NIBBLE OF THIS ONE 
OH THAT IS REALLY BITTER 
UGH THANKS JACKIE 
IT'S WORMWOOD ITS WORMWOOD OH THE WHOLE WORMWOOD FAMILY IS INCREDIBLY BITTER 
BUT THE BITTERNESS IS WHERE THE MEDICINE IS 
WORMWOOD DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS ON THE LABEL IT'S A HERB THAT WE WOULD USE FOR INTESTINAL WORMS 
IN MEDIEVAL TIMES THERE WERE A LOT OF WORMS AROUND 
IT'S A VERY POWERFUL HERB 
IF HERBALISTS WANTED TO DO THAT THESE DAYS WE COULD USE IT BUT WE TEND NOT TO BECAUSE IT'S QUITE BRUTAL 
BUT THAT TAKES US BACK TO THIS MEDIEVAL TRADITION OF PURGE AND SCOUR 
ESSENTIALLY I THINK THEY LIVED MUCH CLOSER TO DEATH 
THEREFORE THEY HAD TO WORK FAST AND WORK WITH QUITE A BIT OF DRAMA TO GET RESULTS 
ALSO PERHAPS YOU KNOW THEIR PATIENTS WANTED TO SEE THOSE RESULTS HAPPENING AS WELL 
SO THERE WAS LOTS OF LAXATIVES LOTS OF HERBS THAT WOULD MAKE YOU SICK 
LOTS OF HERBS LIKE WORMWOOD THAT WOULD REALLY SCOUR OUT THE INTESTINE 
SO THEY'D BE THRILLED THEY'D BE LIKE THIS IS REALLY WORKING 
IT'S WORKING BECAUSE I CAN'T STOP VOMITING RIGHT 
FOLLOWING THE MODERN ROUTE SOUTH TO WITHIN REACH OF THE BORDER WITH ENGLAND 
THERE IS MORE EVIDENCE OF KING DAVID'S STRATEGY TO UNITE SCOTLAND 
THE GREAT ABBEYS HE BUILT IN THE BORDER TERRITORIES 
SYMBOLS OF A PROUD NEW SCOTLAND IN THE MAKING 
THE ABBEY OF MELROSE WAS ONE OF THE MOST MAJESTIC BUILDINGS IN MEDIEVAL SCOTLAND 
IT'S ONE OF THE FOUR ABBEYS DAVID BUILT IN THIS SMALL REGION 
KNOWN AS THE BORDER ABBEYS THEY WERE THE HEIGHT OF MODERNITY 
CUTTING EDGE INSTITUTIONS CENTRES OF LEARNING POLITICS AND COMMERCE 
ABOVE ALL THEY BROUGHT PRESTIGE 
SO DAVID ENTICED MONKS TO SCOTLAND FROM ALL OVER EUROPE TEMPTING THEM WITH MONEY TO BUILD NEW MONASTERIES 
HE KNEW THAT THESE MONASTERIES WOULD BRING WITH THEM CULTURE WEALTH AND SECURITY 
MORE IMPORTANTLY HE REALISED THAT BUILDING THEM HERE ON THE BORDER 
WOULD SEND A POWERFUL MESSAGE TO THE ENGLISH JUST A FEW MILES THAT WAY 
IT WAS SUCH AN IMPORTANT STATEMENT FOR KING DAVID HE ALMOST BROKE THE TREASURY BUILDING THEM 
THE RUINS ONLY HINT AT THEIR FORMER GRANDEUR 
AND MELROSE BUILT IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX WAS ONE OF THE RICHEST IN SCOTLAND 
EVENTUALLY OWNING TWENTY THOUSAND ACRES OF THE SURROUNDING LAND 
THE ABBEY WAS A TRIUMPH 
THE MONKS INTRODUCED NEW FARMING TECHNIQUES TO THE LOCALS 
AND MADE MELROSE ONE OF THE BIGGEST WOOL PRODUCERS IN EUROPE 
THE BORDER ABBEYS WERE PRIME TARGETS FOR THE ENGLISH WHO COMPLETELY DESTROYED MELROSE IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO 
AT GREAT EXPENSE ROBERT THE BRUCE RE BUILT IT 
HE WAS SO ATTACHED TO IT HE EVEN DECREED HIS HEART SHOULD BE BURIED HERE 
ROBERT THE BRUCE HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO DIE A HERO ON CRUSADE BUT HE DIDN'T 
HE DIED NEAR DUMBARTON OF AN UNCLEAN AILMENT ALMOST CERTAINLY LEPROSY 
BUT HIS DYING WISHES WERE HONOURED WHEN HIS HEART WAS PLACED INSIDE A CASKET 
AND TAKEN ON CRUSADE AGAINST THE MUSLIMS IN SPAIN 
IT DIDN'T DO THEM MUCH GOOD THOUGH 
BEFORE THEY RODE IN TO BATTLE THEY HURLED BRUCE'S CASKET BEFORE THEM 
CRYING WHEREVER BRUCE GOES SCOTLAND FOLLOWS 
AND THEN THEY RODE IN TO BATTLE AND WERE PROMPTLY BUTCHERED 
THE LEGEND GOES THAT ROBERT'S HEART WAS RETRIEVED FROM THE BATTLEFIELD AND BROUGHT BACK TO MELROSE ABBEY 
STRANGELY ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO ARCHAEOLOGISTS DID FIND A LEAD CASKET RIGHT HERE UNDER THE ABBEY 
AND ON THAT LEAD CASKET WAS THE LEGEND 
THE ENCLOSED LEAD CASKET CONTAINING A HEART 
WAS FOUND BENEATH THE CHAPTER HOUSE FLOOR MARCH NINETEEN TWENTY ONE BY HIS MAJESTY'S OFFICE OF WORKS 
THAT HEART WAS RE BURIED HERE ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF BRUCE'S VICTORY OVER THE ENGLISH AT BANNOCKBURN 
BUT OF COURSE NOBODY REALLY CAN BE SURE IF THIS EVEN IS ROBERT THE BRUCE'S HEART 
BY DRIVING ONLY A FEW MILES I'VE REACHED THE VERY SOUTH OF MODERN SCOTLAND 
WHEN THE MAP WAS MADE AROUND ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THIS REGION WAS PART OF THE INFAMOUS BORDER LANDS 
PROBABLY THE MOST LAWLESS AREA IN THE WHOLE OF MEDIEVAL BRITAIN 
NO ENGLISH MAPMAKER COULD POSSIBLY HAVE MADE IT THIS FAR NORTH 
THESE BORDER LANDS WERE FOR THE VERY BRAVE OR FOR THE VERY FOOLISH 
GENERATIONS OF WARFARE BETWEEN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND 
MADE LIFE HERE SO RISKY LOCALS NEEDED ACCESS TO A PLACE LIKE THIS TO STAND ANY CHANCE OF SURVIVING 
A MINI FORTRESS KNOWN AS A PEEL TOWER 
STUCK OUT HERE ON THE MOORS YOU WERE VULNERABLE TO ATTACK FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER 
RAIDERS WOULD SWEEP THROUGH BURN YOUR CROPS AND STEAL YOUR LIVESTOCK 
ONLY TO BE FOLLOWED A FEW MONTHS LATER BY AN ATTACK FROM THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS RELENTLESS 
ALL ALONG THE BORDER HUNDREDS OF FORTIFIED SAFE HOUSES WERE BUILT 
LIKE THIS ONE AT SMAILHOLM HOME OF THE PRINGLE FAMILY 
YET TO MAKE A NAME IN KNITWEAR 
NATURAL CLIFFS ON THREE SIDES LEFT ATTACKERS JUST ONE APPROACH 
THEIR ONLY WAY IN A NARROW STAIRCASE SPIRALLING TO FAVOUR THE DEFENDER'S SWORD ARM 
ON THE FOURTH FLOOR BEHIND WALLS OVER TWO METRES THICK 
THERE WAS SPACE FOR UP TO FIFTY PEOPLE TO SHELTER 
IN THE FACE OF THIS CONSTANT ONSLAUGHT IT WAS HARD FOR THE LAW ABIDING TO MAKE A LIVING 
WITH THEIR LIVELIHOODS IN RUINS MANY OF THE BORDER FAMILIES TURNED TO SHADIER PROFESSIONS 
CATTLE RUSTING ROBBERY AND RACKETEERING BECAME SOME OF THE ONLY LUCRATIVE CAREERS AROUND HERE 
THEY BECAME THE MEDIEVAL MAFIA NOTORIOUS OUTLAW CLANS KNOWN AS THE BORDER REAVERS 
DESPITE THEIR MURDEROUS WAYS REAVERS BECAME GREAT ROGUE HEROES OF THE TIME 
THEIR NAMES ROMANTICISED FOREVER IN LOCAL FOLKLORE 
THE HUMES DOUGLAS' THE SCOTTS THE TURNBULLS ELLIOTTS AND ARMSTRONGS 
THE DOUGLAS HUMES OF COURSE 
THE JOHNSONS UM THEN THE NIXONS WERE ALSO REAVERS WOW 
THAT'S A DISTINGUISHED COLLECTION OF NAMES 
THE REAVERS HAD THIS GREAT CLAN FAMILY TRADITION 
AS THEY WERE VILLAINS AND VAGABONDS WANDERING ROUND THE BORDERS 
SO IN THE ONGOING WARS BETWEEN SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND WHOSE SIDE WERE THE REAVERS ON 
THEY WERE A LAW UNTO THEMSELVES 
THEY TOOK SIDES WHEN IT SUITED THEM 
THEY WERE OPPORTUNISTS I WOULD SAY 
WITHOUT AUTHORITY IN THIS AREA THEY DECIDED THAT THEY WERE SAFER DOING THEIR OWN THING 
THERE WAS ONE WONDERFUL STORY ABOUT A VISITOR 
WANDERING IN TO LIDDERSDALE TERRITORY WHICH WAS VERY DANGEROUS 
AT ONE POINT SAYING ARE THERE ANY CHRISTIANS HERE 
THEY SAID NO ONLY ELLIOTTS AND ARMSTRONGS 
SO IS A PART OF YOU ASHAMED TO BEAR A NAME OF CATTLE RUSTLERS AND RACKETEERS 
WHY DO YOU THINK I SHOULD BE ASHAMED I'M INTENSELY PROUD OF IT 
UM THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE AS LONG AS YOU WERE ON THEIR SIDE 
THIS WAS VERY IMPORTANT AND I'M VERY PROUD I'M VERY PROUD OF THEIR RESOURCEFULNESS 
AND THEIR SURVIVAL INSTINCTS AND THEY WERE TOUGH 
NO I AM VERY PROUD OF THEM 
THE REAVERS WILD RULE BECAME SUCH A PROBLEM IT WAS DECLARED LEGAL TO KILL ANYONE LIVING IN THE AREA 
EVENTUALLY MANY WERE DRIVEN FROM THE REGION THEIR DESCENDENTS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE WORLD 
THE MOST FAMOUS EVEN REACHED THE MOON NEIL ARMSTRONG 
BUT AT THE TIME OF THE MAP THE BORDER LANDS WERE A NO GO ZONE FOR ALL BUT THE MOST INTREPID TRAVELLER 
THIS WOULD HAVE HUGE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE GOUGH MAPMAKER 
RELYING ON WORD OF MOUTH TO BUILD HIS PICTURE OF BRITAIN 
HE HAD PRECIOUS LITTLE INFORMATION TO GO ON FROM NORTH OF THE BORDER 
NO WONDER HE KNEW SO LITTLE OF SCOTLAND'S GEOGRAPHY 
YET STILL THE GOUGH MAP GIVES US AN EVOCATIVE GLIMPSE OF LIFE HERE 
THE THRIVING ABBEYS AND CASTLES ALONG THE BORDER 
THE DANGEROUS WILDERNESS INLAND AND THE COASTS FAMED FOR FISH NOW LONG SINCE GONE 
BUT MEDIEVAL SCOTLAND WAS SO MUCH MORE THAN THIS 
AND IT'S NOT HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY SO DESPERATELY WANTED TO KEEP IT FOR THEMSELVES
