THEY HAD THE 
TEMERITY TO SEND CHELSEA PARKING ON 
A RAW NIGHT AT OAKWELL IN THE 
QUARTER FINALS PATTING 
CARDIFF'S ROUTE TO WEMBLEY HAS BEEN 
NO LESS SPECTACULAR AND IN TREVOR 
SINCLAIR THEY HAVE THE SCORE OF 
NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN'S GOAL OF THE SEASON IN AN F. A. 
CUP TIE AGAINST BARNSLEY OF FANTASY FOOTBALL COMES TRUE FOR 
BARNSLEY AND CARDIFF CITY THE 
FIRESIDE TALES OF HEROES OF LONG 
AGO WILL BE REPLACED BY LEE THE 
SAGA OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT LEGEND OF TODAY'S 
WINNERS BY DECIDER BARNSLEY ARE 
PLAYING THEIR FIRST SEMI FINAL 
SINCE THEY WON THE COMPETITION IN 
NINETEEN TWELVE NINE DAYS AFTER THE SINKING 
OF THE TITANIC THEY WERE THE FIRST 
NON ENGLISH SIDE TO LIFT THE TROPHY 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN JUST AFTER THE 
TRANSATLANTIC PHONE CALL HAD BEEN 
MADE AND THE MOVE IS WERE STILL 
SILENT AND THE MOVIES WERE STILL 
SILENT THERE IS A CRACKLING 
ATMOSPHERE CREATED BY SUPPORTERS 
WHO ARE NOT USED TO A HEADY DAYS 
LIKE THIS TO A HEADY DAYS JIMMY FLOYD CASTLE BANK A SUB BY 
CHELSEA IN TWO THOUSAND TWO IS UPFRONT WITH 
SINCLAIR JIMMY HASSELBAINK CARDIFF CITY IN BLACK WITH THE 
YELLOW TRIM GET US UNDER WAY FIVE 
POINTS OFF THE PROMOTION PLAY OFFS 
THEY HOPE TO RETURN HERE FOR ROAD 
PROMOTION PLAY OFF FINAL IN 
AND 
THE F. A. CUP FINAL FOR A PROMOTION 
IN THE CROWD DAVID MORGAN WHO WAS 
SIXTEEN IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN WHEN HE SAW CARDIFF BEAT 
ARSENAL IN THIS VERY STADIUM HE 
HAS RETURNED TODAY AGED NINETY SEVEN JOE LEDLEY SCORES HIS SECOND IN JUST EIGHT MINUTES WHAT A GREAT PIECE OF IMPROVISATION 
THAT WAS JOHNSON CAME FROM THE 
BACK I THINK HE WAS THE ONE WHO 
CAUSED THE TROUBLE HE WAS 
SURROUNDED BY THREE PLAYERS IT WAS 
FLICKED ON LOVELY PIECE OF SKILL KEPT HIS EYE 
ON THE BALL THE WAY DO NOT GO FOR 
POWER JUST PUT IT TOWARDS THE GOAL 
BEAUTIFUL HE JUST GOT HIS LEFT FOOT ON THAT BUT IT CAME OFF HIS SHIN THE KEEPER WAS BEATEN BUT LOOVENS WAS WELL PLACED AND IT IS A CORNER FOR BARNSLEY WHEN HE GETS ON THE BALL JUST CLEAR THE SPACE HE WAS JUST WIDE LOOKS TO THE HEAVENS BUT THEY WILL 
NOT HELP THEM WILL NOT HELP AND 
THEREFORE STOP 
WILL NOT HELP HIM 
THEREFORE STOP WILL NOT HELP HIM THERE THAT WAS JUST A WHISKER ODEJAYI GOT A CROSS HIS MAN AND GOT 
THE SHOT AWAY 
THAT IS WHAT 
BARNSLEY CAN DO AT THEIR BEST SO HE GOT A CROSS HIS MAN AT THE 
NEAR POST A LOT OF POWER IN THE 
SHOT CARDIFF NEARLY HAD A SECOND BUT A 
FREE KICK WAS GIVEN AGAINST THEM IN 
THE END 
THAT WAS POOR DEFENDING 
FROM KOZLUK HASSELL BANK HAD THE SHOT A GOOD 
PARRY BUT TREVOR SINCLAIR DID NOT 
GET HOLD OF IT IT JIMMY 
HASSELBAINK THEY ARE ALWAYS LOOKING TO CROSS 
AS A STRIKER YOU KNOW WHERE YOU 
STAND THE HE HAS HAD A FEW MOMENTS HE COMPLAINED TO THE REFEREE HE 
WAS NOWHERE NEAR THAT BALL A ONE 
OF THE GREAT BARNSLEY FANS OF ALL 
TIME MICHAEL PARKINSON HE IS 
SITTING ALONGSIDE HIS WIFE DID IT 
ON THE HAND 
I THINK THAT TOUCHED HIS HAND 
DEFLECTED UP IN THE AIR ON HIS HAND THERE IS A TOUCH ON THE ARM IT WAS STRAIGHT AT THE GOALKEEPER 
WITH CHANCE TO SEND CARDIFF TO 
THE FINAL 
WHAT A CROSS 
WHITTINGHAM HAD A LOVELY DELIVERY HE DID NOT GET ANY POWER BEHIND THE 
HEADER THAT WAS A GREAT 
OPPORTUNITY BUT IT IS SIX YARDS OUT HE COULD BE FIT FOR THE FINAL ODEJAYI HAVE WHAT A MOMENT 
HISTORY BECKONS THE MAN WHO 
DEFEATED CHELSEA AND KNOCKED OUT 
THE HOLDERS IN THE LAST ROUND HAD A 
GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO DRAW BARNSLEY 
LEVEL IN THE SEMI FINAL HE TOOK HIS TIME COMPOSED HIMSELF 
I THINK GOAL HE BACKS OFF STANDS 
UP BIG BUT IT IS AN AWFUL MESS F. A. CUP SEMI FINAL INCREDIBLE COME ON HE IS SAYING TO HIS TEAM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF A WINNER YOU CAN SEE THE DIP ANDY COLE AWAY 
FROM THE GOALKEEPER HE STRUCK IT 
LOVELY AND THE DIP AND THE 
CURLING STRONG SAVE BY LUKE STEELE THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD ONE EARLIER 
WITH THE FREE HEADER L. THINK 
FOSTER TOOK THIS TO FIRE NARROWED 
HIS AN ANGLE TOO FAR THEY ARE THE ENVY OF EVERY PREMIER 
LEAGUE TEAM BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE 
YOU WANT TO BE ON SEMI FINAL DAY 
CONTESTING THIS IS JUST A MOMENT TO FORGET FOR HIM EVERYONE LOOKS TOWARDS THE REFEREE 
JUST SECONDS REMAIN IN THE BARNSLEY 
DREAM CARDIFF HAVE WON THE F. A. CUP SEMI 
FINAL WHAT AN EMOTIONAL DAY FOR A 
REAL FOOTBALL MAN DAVID JONES 
CARDIFF MANAGER THEY ARE BACK IN 
AN F. A. CUP FINAL FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SINCE NINETEEN TWENTY SEVENTH DOUBT THAT EVEN 
JOE LEDLEY'S GRANDAD WAS BORN THEN 
THE TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD HAS SENT CARDIFF 
THROUGH BARNSLEY LOOK BACK AT THE 
CHANCE MISSED BY ODEJAYI IN THE 
SECOND HALF IT WAS THEIR MOMENT 
IT DID NOT COME INSTEAD JOE 
LEDLEY'S GOAL WILL BRING CARDIFF 
BACK TO THE F. A. CUP FINAL AT WEMBLEY 
ON MAY SEVENTEENTH IT WILL BE PORTSMOUTH 
FROM THE PREMIER LEAGUE AGAINST 
CARDIFF OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP

THE F. A. CUP FINAL IN LONDON 
CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE BEEN TO 
THE SEMI FINALS AS A PLAYER NOW

THAT FEEL 
THEY'RE UP THERE WITH 
THE BEST IN THE F. A. CUP IT HAS TO 
BE UP THERE WITH THE BEST IT IS 
ABOUT TIME I REACHED THE FINAL AN AN EPIC JOURNEY AND TEARS AT THE END 
FOR SOME OF YOUR PLAYERS 
THEY HAD 
BEEN FANTASTIC THEY BEAT LABOUR 
COULD THEY BEAT CHELSEA THEY HAD 
FOUR HAD ROUNDS THEY BEAT 
LIVERPOOL HARD ROUNDS THEY HAD 
TO GET THE MOMENT BUT TOMORROW 
THEY REALISE WHAT THEY HAD ACHIEVED 
THEY ARE HURTING AT THE MOMENT 
HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT YOU WERE BACK 
IN AGAIN WHEN KAYODE ODEJAYI SENT A 
GOAL THROUGH 
ARE UNFORTUNATELY HE 
MISSED THE TARGET L. AM NOT GOING 
TO BLAME THEM WE WENT TOGETHER AND 
WE LOSE TOGETHER 
I THOUGHT IT WAS 
IN AND IT WASN'T IT IS YOU'RE DAY 
THEY ARE THE LITTLE BITS OF LUCK 
THAT YOU NEED ON GAMES LIKE THIS 
TAMMY ABOUT THE GOAL IT SEEMED TO 
DROP OUT OF THE SKY AND YOU HAD 
TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT TELL ME 
THE LOG WAS THERE IT WENT IN IT 
WAS PROBABLY THE BEST I SCORED 
MOST IMPORTANT PROBABLY 
DEFINITELY IT SENT US THROUGH TO 
THE FINAL 
CAN YOU BELIEVE YOU'RE 
IN ANOTHER F. A. CUP FINAL AT THE AGE 
OF THIRTY SIX 
YES NO YES IF YOU WOULD 
HAVE SAID THAT A FEW MONTHS AGO I 
WOULD HAVE LAUGHED 
DO YOU THINK 
THEY WILL STOP TALKING ABOUT NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN 
ONLY IF WE WIN IT FOUR OZ THE LAST 
FEW YEARS IN THIS FOOTBALL CLUB 
EVERYBODY DESERVES BIG PAT ON THE 
BACK FOR US IT HAS BEEN A LONG 
ROAD WHEN YOU SEE THE NEW STADIUM 
NOW AND WE ARE AT THEIR HOTEL WITH 
A MAGNIFICENT TRAINING FACILITIES 
THE CLUB CAN'T GO FORWARD THIS 
WILL HOPEFULLY GIVE US THAT EXTRA 
PUSH PUSH WELL DONE TO THE BLUEBIRDS WHAT 
DID YOU MAKE A BIG GAME 
NOT A 
CLASSIC I THOUGHT CARDIFF SETTLED 
BETTER THEY TOOK CONTROL OF THE 
GAMES BARNSLEY HAD GOOD PRESSURE 
BUT COULD NOT FINISH IT OFF IN THE 
FINAL THIRD AND THOSE ARE THE 
REASONS IT WAS NOT A CLASSIC GAME 
BUT CARDIFF WILL NOT COMPLAIN THEY 
ARE IN THE FINAL AND WELL DONE BIG 
OPPOSITION TO GET THERE FOR BOTH 
TEAMS 
YOU DO NOT WANT TO CONCEDE A TEAMS GOAL EARLY ON IT IS A PROPER CAKE 
IT WAS A POOR GAME PROPER KICK 
AS THE BALL DROPPED HERE TO JOE 
LEDLEY YOU JUST PUT CITY IN OVER 
HIS SHOULDER THEY PLAYED VERY WELL 
AND ROGER JOHNSON WAS KEY FOB THEM 
HE HEADED SO MANY BALLS ADRIAN 
DURING THE GAME KEITH FOR THEM 
HE ATTACKS THE BALL KEY HE MADE 
UP HIS MIND TO GO AND HEADED HE 
GETS THREE HEADERS ON THERE IS ONE 
IT BOUNCES BACK HE HEADS IT OUT 
AGAIN EVENTUALLY IT COMES AGAIN 
AND HE IS OUT OF HIS BOX AGAIN A 
BRILLIANT PERFORMANCE HE READS THE 
GAME KAYODE ODEJAYI DID NOT REALLY 
HAVE KICK IN THE FIRST HALF AND 
HE CAN TACKLE HERE LOOK AT THIS 
VERY TACKLE HE PROBABLY SAVED THE 
BEST TACKLE UNTIL LAST AND HE 
READS THE GAME WELL KAYODE ODEJAYI 
THINKS HE IS IN HERE HE IS THROUGH 
COVERING UP GETS HIS BODY IN THE 
WAKE AND SWEEPS THE BALL TO SAFETY 
HE WAS TOWER FOR THEM DAVID 
JONES PAID TRIBUTE TO HIM 
AFTERWARDS WHICH IS ALWAYS NICE 
FUND MANAGERS 
THE KEY MAN FOR 
CARDIFF WAS AT THE BACK THE KEY 
MAN FOR BARNSLEY WEST AT THE 
FRONT 
MAN FOR BARNSLEY WEST AT THE FRONT HE SCORED THE VITAL GOAL FOR 
CHELSEA HE WAS A REAL HANDFUL IF 
BANKSY WERE GOING TO WIN THIS GAME 
HE NEEDED TO PLAY WELL BAN 
SLEEVE HE BLOWS HOT AND COLD 
TODAY WE SOLD MORE OF THE BAD THAN 
THE GOOD KAYODE ODEJAYI IS 
BIG 
MAN BIG PRESENCE ANY YOUNG HE 
SHARES THAT HE CAN BE A THREAT IN 
THE BOX HE SHOWS THAT HE CAN BE 
A THREAT THE PROBLEM FOR HIM HE 
IS NOT A GREAT FINISHER HE GETS 
ACROSS THE DEFENDER AND 
NOT 
FINISH HE DOES NOT QUITE MAKE THE 
CONTACT IT IS POOR SECOND TOUCH 
HE IS NOT THE MOST CONFIDENT IN THE 
BOX HE GOES TO SLEEP MENTALLY HE 
SHOULD BE LOOKING TO GET ON HIS 
BIKE HERE HOWARD WHIPS ACROSS WELL 
IF HE WAS ON MOVE HERE HE WOULD 
GET A CHANCE HE SHOULD PULL BACK 
DOWN ON HIS CHEST AND HE WOULD HAVE 
HAD A CHANCE OF SHOT BY 
THE TIME THE ULTIMATE CHANCE CAME THE 
CRUCIAL MOMENT I DO NOT THINK HE 
WAS IN THE BEST FRAME OF MIND OR 
REALLY TAKES THE BEST TOUCH HE 
TAKES HIS TOUCH HERE AND HE PUSHES 
IT AWAY FROM THE GOAL IS STILL 
BEING MORE CENTRAL WHICH WOULD HAVE 
GIVEN A BETTER ANGLE BY THE TIME 
HE HITS IT HE IS AT THE ANGLE AND 
HE PUTS IT IN HE WILL BE 
DISTRAUGHT YOU HAVE TO FEEL FOR 
HIM THERE ARE STILL GAMES THAT FOR 
BARNSLEY THEY'RE IN A RELEGATION 
FIGHT AND HE CAN PLAY A BIG PART 
YOU CAN SEE THAT HE IS VERY MUCH 
INVOLVED IN THE PLATE ON ANOTHER 
DAY HE 
DAY HE 
COULD HAVE HAD A HAT TRICK 
DAY HE COULD HAVE HAD A HAT TRICK SOME PEOPLE ADALAT THRUST ON THEM 
HOW WOULD HE BOUNCED BACK FROM 
THAT 
HAVE A LOT THRUST THAT HE HAS GOT WATFORD AWAY AND 
WEDNESDAY HE WILL HAVE TO PULL IT 
OUT 
YOU'LL ALWAYS GET ANOTHER OUT CHANCE HE WOULD HOPE HE HAS OTHER 
ATTRIBUTES HE CAN FEED OFF ON THE 
TEAM 
WHAT ABOUT THE RELEGATION TEAM BATTLE WHAT APPLIES TO HIM 
PSYCHOLOGICALLY APPLIES TO THE 
WHOLE TEAM 
THEY HAVE CARDIFF AT 
THE END OF THE SEASON THAT MIGHT 
DO THEM A FAVOUR AND OF THE SEASON 
LEICESTER AT HOME THAT IS BIG 
THAT IS THEIR RELEGATION BATTLE IT 
WILL BE TOUGH FOR THEM THERE IN 
THE BOTTOM THREE 
ONE BIT OF 
ALARMING NEWS FOR CARDIFF IF THEY 
DID WIN THE F. A. CUP THEY WOULD NOT 
QUALIFY FOR THE UEFA CUP BECAUSE 
THEY ARRAY WHY SIZE UNDER THE 
CONTROLS BUT THEY NEED TO GET A 
WILD CARD THEY ARE A WELSH SIDE 
THEY ARE PLAYING IN THE ENGLISH CUP 
IT WOULD BE ASHAMED 
COMMON SENSE 
SHOULD PREVAIL SURELY IF THEY WIN 
THE CUP LET THEM THROUGH 
COMMONSENSE SHOULD ALWAYS PREVAIL 
BE BETTER LOOKOUT YESTERDAY'S SEMI 
FINAL WE JOINED THE TRAVELLING 
ARMY FROM PORTSMOUTH BE BETTER

WAITING HOPE MIDDLESBROUGH HAVE 
READ THE SCRIPT TA BEAGLE TWO 
EVERTON DREAMING OF DOUBLING THEIR 
WIN TALLY OF ONE DERBY GO TO 
EVERTON 
MIDDLESBROUGH VERSUS MANCHESTER 
UNITED CHELSEA ONE YESTERDAY SO A 
WIN FOR THE SIDE AT THE TOP OF THE 
TABLE FELT MORE OR LESS ESSENTIAL 
AND GIVING THEIR CURRENT FORM 
HIGHLY LIKELY 
JUST NOW EVERYTHING MANCHESTER 
UNITED TOUCH TURNS TO GOLD 
BUT THE SEVENTEENTH LEAGUE TITLE IS NOT IN 
THE BIKEY AT AND TODAY'S OPPONENTS 
MIDDLESBROUGH KNOW A THING OR TWO 
ABOUT UPSETTING THE FORM BOOK 
AGAINST THE BIG GUNS AT THE 
RIVERSIDE IS NOT IN THE BACK 
JUST YET RONALDO HAS HAD THIRTY SIX GOALS AND 
COUNTING THIS YEAR MIDDLESBROUGH 
ARE THE TEAM HAVE SCORED THIRTY FIVE ACROSS 
ALL COMPETITIONS AS TEAM IT IS GIGGS' SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY IF GAME FOR THE 
CLUB TEN MORE TO PASS SIR BOBBY 
CHARLTON'S RECORD SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTIETH JULIO ARCA WAS RELATE HE 
APOLOGISES INSTANTLY TO THE REFEREE 
WAS REALLY LATE IT COMES BEHIND FOREHEAD CORNER FAURE CORNER IT HAS TURNED IN CRISTIANO RONALDO OF COURSE IT HAD TO BE NO 
MATTER WHO THE OPPOSITION IS NO MATTER WHAT SORT OF GOAL THAT IS 
HE SCORES IN EVERY SINGLE GAME 
RIGHT PLACE RIGHT TIME SAME 
RESULT EVERY TIME HE JUST PEELED AWAY FROM THE 
CHALLENGE OF LUKE YOUNG HE FOUND 
SPACE FOR HIMSELF AND TUCKED IT 
INTO THE NET THAT WAS A WONDERFUL TACKLE A 
CHALLENGE THAT HAD TO BE MADE AND 
GOT RIGHT BY LUTON BY LUKE YOUNG FERDINAND WITH A HEADER THE WHISTLE HAS GONE A FERDINAND JUST PUT HIS ARMS INTO THE BACK OF LUKE YOUNG UNITED FRANTICALLY APPEAL FOR A 
FREE KICK AND IT DID LOOK LIKE A 
CHALLENGE FROM BEHIND BUT 
PLAYGOERS ON EVRA IS STILL DOWN NOT A GOOD FINISH HE SEEMED TO BE 
CAUGHT IN TWO MINDS WHETHER TO 
SQUARE IT WILL GO FOR GOAL HIMSELF 
HAD THAT GOT IN SIR ALEX FERGUSON 
WOULD HAVE ABSOLUTELY LOST THE PLOT 
WITH THE OFFICIALS RYAN GIGGS 
CRISTIANO RONALDO REAR FERDINAND 
ARSENAL PROTESTING THIS IS WIDE 
HOW IS THAT NOT FOUL HE WAS JUST OFF BALANCE WHEN IT CAME TO THE CRUCIAL MOMENT THERE IS JUST NO CONTAINING THIS 
MAN IMMENSE CONFIDENCE HE CAN 
BEAT EVERYBODY FERDINAND'S TACKLE IS RULED US MORE OF A LUNCH BY THE REF VAN DER SAR GOT A BIG HAND TO IT 
THE WHISTLE HAS GONE ANYWAY MIKE 
RILEY HAS OBJECTED TO THE CHALLENGE 
OF O'NEILL IT WAS A BIT LIKE 
RONALDO THE WAY IT TIPPED OVER THE 
TOP OF THE WALL FROM ALVES IT WAS 
ALL VAN DER SAR COULD DO TO BEAT IT 
AWAY POGATETZ COULD NOT QUITE GET 
THE POWER ALVES HAS LEVELLED FOR 
MIDDLESBROUGH ALFONSO ALVES GOAL 
WAS HIS FIRST MIDDLESBROUGH GOAL 
SCORES HIS FIRST MEDAL BORO GOAL MIDDLESBROUGH A GOAL IT IS PERFECT FOR ALVES AND THE FINISH IS PRETTY SPECIAL TO ALFONSO ALVES FINALLY ANNOUNCES HIS 
ENGLISH FOOTBALL RIVAL FOOTBALL 
ARRIVAL DOWNING GAVE HIMSELF TOO MUCH TIME 
COME OUT CAME VAN DER SAR IN AN 
INSTANT TOO MUCH TIME OUT CAME 
VAN DER SAR KARIC GOT 
A TOUCH TO IT IT WILL BE A CORNER ON LUKE YOUNG MICHAEL CARRICK IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT WAS BLOCKED 
BY THE BRIDGE TO ME AT FIRST 
GLANCE OR MAYBE 
THE LEFT ARM JULIO ARCA BLOCKED THE CROSS AND THE SECOND HALF BEGINS AT THE SAME 
BREAKNECK SPEED THAT WE SAW 
THROUGHOUT THE FIRST HALF ALVES 
GOT THAT WRONG AS THE SNOW COMES 
DOWN GARETH SOUTHGATE HAS 
DISPENSED WITH THE OVERCOAT ALVES GOAL AS A DOUBLE FOR 
MIDDLESBROUGH SCORES DOUBLE 
FOR MIDDLESBROUGH MIDDLESBROUGH'S 
GOAL MACHINE HAS GOT TWO AND A LEAD 
MANCHESTER UNITED THE THEY LEAD 
MANCHESTER UNITED A LUCKY BREAK THIS TIME FOR THE 
BRAZILIAN HIT MAN AN EQUALLY GOOD 
FINISH HIS EYES WERE TRAINED ON THE GOAL 
IT IS ALL ABOUT ALVES HE HAS BEEN 
WAITING FOR THE BIGGEST STAGE TO 
SHINE BRIGHTEST OF ALL KNOCKED OVER I'LL THIS WHAT A 
CRUCIAL BLOCK BY RIO FERDINAND 
KNOCKED OVER ALVES THAT WAS A GOAL SAVING BLOCK FROM FERDINAND IT IS A WINTER WONDERLAND RIGHT NOW ROONEY FINISHES IT TOOK A BIG 
DEFLECTION ON ITS WAY IN BUT IT IS 
WAYNE ROONEY'S GOAL AND MANCHESTER 
UNITED ARE RECHARGED SO MUCH 
CREDIT GOES TO PARK PARK PLAYED IN BY MICHAEL CARRICK TURNS 
FAST TAYLOR BEAUTIFULLY PAST 
TAYLOR IT SKIPS OFF DAVID 
WHEATER'S WHICH OVER THE STRANDED 
SCHWARZER OF DAVID WHITTAKER WAS 
MY BROOD IN THESE CONDITIONS THIS WAS A REAL GAMBLE WHAT A CROSS FROM HARGREAVES THAT 
WAS THAT WAS ALL THAT ROONEY COULD 
DO AND THERE IS A BIT OF A SPAT ON THE 
TOUCHLINE BETWEEN GARETH SOUTHGATE 
AND SIR ALEX FERGUSON THE FOURTH 
OFFICIAL FINDS IT RATHER AMUSING SO 
IT CANNOT BE TOO SERIOUS JUST LOOK 
AT THIS DOWN IN THE TECHNICAL AREA 
SOUTHGATE IS NOT ABOUT TO PAY 
HOMAGE TO THE MAN WHO IS 
EVERYBODY'S SENIOR IN MANAGEMENT 
TERMS THAT IS FULL TIME 
WHAT A GAME WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE RIVERSIDE THAT 
MAKES THE PREMIER LEAGUE'S ELITE 
DROP POINTS HERE SO OFTEN A FOUR 
GOAL THRILLER ON TEESSIDE 
FROM THE ENTERTAINMENT POINT OF 
VIEW I THINK IT WAS REALLY VERY 
GOOD TO SEE FROM OUTSIDE BUT FROM 
THE COACH'S POINT OF VIEW WE DO 
NOT LIKE TO SEE THIS KIND OF GAME 
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO US THE ENIGMA OF 
MIDDLESBROUGH FOOTBALL CLUB 
NO IT 
IS ABOUT NINETEEN WORDS SHORTER THAN HE 
WANTED I THINK WE'RE A TEAM WHO ON 
OUR DAY ARE CAPABLE OF COMPETING 
WITH THE BEST IT MIGHT HAVE GONE 
TWO WAYS L. FELT WE WOULD ALWAYS 
WIN THE GAME THAT IS UNFORTUNATE 
THAT WE LEAD TWO SCRAPPY GOALS IN 
WHEN YOU PLAY AGAINST THEM YOU 
THINK THEY MIGHT DO SOMETHING OUT 
OF THIS WORLD THAT WAS THEN THE 
GAME AND THEY DID NOT HAVE TO DO 
THAT TODAY 
IT IS A TOUGH PLACE TO 
COME AND THEY PROVED THAT AT THE 
END IT IS PROBABLY A FAIR RESULT 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WHOLE GAME AND 
THE CHANCES 
IS THERE A LITTLE 
NORTH EAST MANY LEAD IN THE MIDDLE 
WE WILL COME OUT ON TOP IN THE 
NORTH EAST MINI LEAGUE WE NEED TO 
GET THIS SEASON OUT OF THE WAY AT 
PESHAWAR NEXT SEASON GET IN EUROPE 
PUSH INTO NEXT SEASON 
WE MUST DO 
THE JOB THAT WE HAVE GOT SOME 
DIFFICULT GAMES AS WELL BUT WE DO 
NOT WANT TO CHANGE OUR POSITION WE 
PREFER BE IN FRONT OF THEM AND 
DO A JOB 
HE SAID FROM A COACHING 
POINT OF VIEW THIS IS NOT THE KIND 
OF GAME WE WANT TO SEE IN RATHER 
FORBIDDING TONES WHAT WAS HE 
TALKING ABOUT 
MAN UNITED STARTED 
BRILLIANTLY THEY WERE OUTSTANDING 
ALEX FERGUSON WAS SITTING BACK WITH 
A SMILE ON HIS FACE BUT THEN THE 
GAME WENT AWAY FROM THEM GOING 
INTO THE CHAMPIONSHIP YOU DO NOT 
WANT A GAME THAT IS OPEN LIKE THAT 
MIDDLESBROUGH WERE OUTSTANDING AT 
TIMES FROM THAT COULD'S POINT OF 
VIEW THERE WAS LOTS FROM 
DEFENSIVELY THAT COACH'S POINT 
OF VIEW UNITED LOOKED SHAKY AT 
TIMES 
SO UNITED SHOULD HAVE PLAYED TIMES IT MORE CONSERVATIVELY 
YOU LIKE TO SEE THAT THEY HAVE 
CONTROL OF THE GAME MIDDLESBROUGH 
THEIR HOME RECORD THEY HAVE WON 
FIVE DRAWN FIVE AND LAST TWO IT 
IS EXCEPTIONAL 
THEY WERE GREAT TO 
WATCH TODAY 
THEY HAD AN ATTACKING 
MINDSET FROM THE START A BIT LIKE 
MANCHESTER UNITED THEY HADN'T 
ATHLETIC MIDFIELD AND THEY HAD A 
GREAT FACTOR UP FRONT THEY WERE 
PLAYING FROM THE FRONT FOOT AT THE 
START AFTER THE GOAL WENT IN THEIR 
REACTION WAS GOOD IF YOU LOOK AT 
THE MADDER BODIES THEY HAVE HERE 
BEAR IN THE ATTACKING POSITION IN 
THE UNITED BOX THEY ARE AS THE BALL GOES INTO THE BOX YOU 
HAVE GOT THREE AGAINST THREE AND 
THEIR TESTING THE DEFENCE OF UNITED 
HERE THREE MAKING IRAN YEAR CAUSING THE 
DEFENCE ON TO OLD PROBLEMS 
MAKING A RUN HERE CAUSING THE 
DEATH FRIENDS LOTS OF PROBLEMS 
DEFENCE LOOK AT THEM COMING BACK 
IN THE YEAR STEAMING BACK 
WILL NOT GIVE UP THEY WERE 
OUTNUMBERED LOOK AT THAT VERY 
BLOCK ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC ALFONSO ALVES THEN THAT SCORING 
ENDS UP SCORING FOR ZAPPY WAS 
PROLIFIC IN HIS DUTCH CLUB AND NOW 
HE IS GETTING HIS MATCH FITNESS IN 
ENGLAND THAT WAS THE KEY FOR THEIR 
GREAT PERFORMANCE 
ENGLAND THAT WAS THE KEY FOR THEIR GREAT PERFORMANCE 
LET'S LOOK AT 
GREAT PERFORMANCE LET'S LOOK AT THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE TITLE RACE 
FOR UNITED THEY NEED TO WORRY 
ABOUT THEIR DEFENCE NOW TODAY TODAY THEY ONLY LET FIFTEEN GOALS IN I THINK 
THEY'RE GOING TO MISS THE DITCH 
THEY ARE MISSING ARE MORE READY 
O'SHEA LOOKED A BIT SHAKY TODAY 
THEY ARE ALL IN POSITION MARKING 
MEN BUT LOOK AT HOW EASY IT BREAKS 
DOWN O'SHEA MAKES A POOR CLEARANCE LOOK AT THE BACK FOUR THE BALL COMES IN NO PROBLEM HERE FROM BROWN S. SOON 
AS CARRICK SWITCHES TO THE OTHER 
SIDE BROWN AT THE TOP OF THE 
SCREEN HE NEEDS TO GET BACK THE BALL COMES OVER HERE IT IS FLICKED ON A FABULOUS FINISH FROM THE BRAZILIAN BROWN IS SLOW TO REACT HERE AND 
THEY END UP SCRAMBLING THE BALL 
AWAY AND THERE ON THE BREAK THIS 
IS THE SECOND GOAL BROWN IS ON THE 
COVER GRID POSITION BUT AS THE 
BALL FLICKS ON LOOK AT THE 
REACTION OF RIO FERDINAND NO COVER 
ON THE SECOND HAD AIR THAT IS SO 
UNLIKE UNITED FERDINAND LIMPED OFF 
AS WELL SO WILL HE BE OUT THEY 
HAVE A PROBLEM AT THE BACK 
THE DEFENCE HAS BEEN FANTASTIC 
THIS IS THE WRONG PART OF THE 
SEASON FOR THIS TO BE HAPPENING 
GARY NEVILLE IS BACK IN TRAINING 
SO MAYBE HE MAY BE ABLE TO COME 
BACK AND PLAY CENTRE BACK BUT IT 
IS A BIG ASK WHEN SOMEBODY HAS BEEN 
OUT FOR A LONG TIME TO COME BACK IN 
THE CENTRE OF DEFENCE THEY HAVE 
SYLVESTER ALSO WHO COULD COME BACK 
IT IS NOT IDEAL 
THE ATTACKING 
THREAT BASED ON SEVENTEEN GOALS CONCEDED 
SO FAR 
WHEN MANCHESTER UNITED 
EQUALISE THERE WAS ONLY GOING TO 
BE ONE RESULT 
THE RESULT AT 
MIDDLESBROUGH WAS SUPERB 
MIDDLESBROUGH WERE EXPLOITING THE 
WEAKNESSES IN MANCHESTER UNITED 
TODAY TODAY LET'S LOOK BACK AT YESTERDAY'S 
PREMIER LEAGUE GAMES ARSENAL AGAIN THEIR LAST HAPPY OF 
THE TWO SIDES THEY FEEL THEY HAVE 
MORE CHANCE OF WINNING THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE THAN THE TITLE CROWD LIVERPOOL HAVE SCORED 
CASTLE'S FREE KICK PETER CROWD 
LIVERPOOL HAVE SCORED AN EQUALISER FROM NICKLAS BENDTNER LUCAS HAD OUR HANDFUL OF CESC FABREGAS'S SHIRT NO PENALTY THE TEAM MANAGED BY THE MAN AT A 
HANGDOG LOOKS AS STUDIED AS CAN BE 
AND SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WIN 
A TITLE IF ANYONE CAN BE FORGIVEN 
AN OWN GOAL IT IS THE MAGNIFICENT 
RICHARD DUNN IF YOU'RE GOING TO 
SCORE AN OWN GOAL IT MAY AS WELL 
BE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY WHAT 
FINISH SALOMON KALOU MADE IT TWO TO TWO 
IN THE SECOND HALF WITH HIS SEVENTH 
PREMIERSHIP GOAL OF THE SEASON THE 
WORSE WAS TO COME FROM MANCHESTER 
CITY WHEN TAKING THIS INNOCUOUS 
LOOKING TUMBLE THE PLAYER 
DISLOCATED HIS SHOULDER AND SEEMS 
TO HAVE SERIOUSLY INJURED HIS WRIST 
ALSO HERE IS THE DAMAGE TO THE TOP OF THE TABLE WE HAVE GOT A PANEL OF EXPERTS AND 
MYSELF TO GO THROUGH THE RESULTS 
THIS IS HOW WE THINK IT WILL PAN 
OUT AT THE QUEEN 
MIGHT HAVE MADE 
OURSELVES LOOK FOOLISH BY SAYING 
MANCHESTER UNITED WILL DRAW IN THE 
NEXT THREE GAMES 
I SAID THEY MAY 
DRAW ANOTHER AGAIN BECAUSE RIO 
FERDINAND IS SAD AND THEY ARE 
SHORT OF NUMBERS IT WAS CLUTCHING 
AT STRAWS IS OUT THEY COULD NOT 
DECIDE SO WE JUST MADE THEM ALL 
DRAWS 
THAT IS 
THE EASIEST THING IN DRAWS THE WORLD 
CHELSEA WILL HAVE TO WIN 
ALL OF THEM BUT THE UNITED ONE IT 
COULD BE A DRAW AND THEN THEY GO 
TO NEWCASTLE WHO HAVE TURNED 
EVERYTHING AROUND 
HERE IS THE FINAL TABLE AS 
PREDICTED BY A MATCH OF THE DAY 
IT WOULD BE TIGHT THEY REALLY ONE 
POINT WHEN IT THIS AL IT WILL 
FINISH THERE WILL BE ONE POINT 
IN IT THIS IS HOW IT WILL FINISH 
IF WE WILL HAVE PILOTS OF THE 
MANCHESTER UNITED WE WILL HAVE 
HIGHLIGHTS OF THESE GAMES NEXT WEEK 
EVERTON VERSES DERBY THE VISITORS 
WOULD LOVE BY THE END OF THE SEASON 
TO ADD TO THEM NOT TERRIBLY 
IMPRESSIVE WIN TOTAL OF A SINGLE 
SOLITARY GAME A WINDOW OF 
OPPORTUNITY WAS OPENED AFTER LAST 
WEEK'S SETBACK IN ANFIELD 
DEFEAT IN A MERSEYSIDE DERBY LEFT 
EVERTON OFF THE PACE IN THE RACE 
VERY CHAMPION LEAGUE'S BATH FOUR 
OF THEIR LAST SIX GAMES ARE AT HOME 
WHERE THEY HAVEN'T LOST IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE THIS YEAR AS FOR 
DADDY AS FOR DANNY TERRIBLE TERRIBLE ROBERT 
THEY STILL HAVE NOT WON A ROBERT GAME UNDER PAUL JEWELL AND EVER 
RELEGATED EVEN BEFORE THE CLOCKS 
WENT FORWARD AND THEY WERE 
RELEGATED ANDREW JOHNSON RETURNS OR EVERTON FOR EVERTON TIDIED UP BY LEWIS BUT AT THE 
EXPENSE OF A CORNER KICK IT WAS 
TOO HIGH THAT WAS ALMOST AN OWN GOAL THAT 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN UNEASY CLEARANCE 
STRAIGHT INTO THE GROUND AND OVER 
FROM THE DEFENDER A CHANCE TO 
BEGIN ANOTHER GOOD CORNER THE EGYPTIAN INTERNATIONAL CONCEDES 
THE FREE KICK MACRO FREE KICK 
IT MUST BE A GOAL SOMEHOW THAT 
STAYED OUT A BIT OF PUSHING INSIDE 
THE PENALTY AREA THE REFEREE 
BLOWING HIS WHISTLE JUST AS THE 
EVERTON SUPPORTERS WERE PREPARING 
TO CLAIM THE FIRST GOAL OF THE 
AFTERNOON SAVED BY HOWARD AWAY TO SAFETY 
DERBY ARE THREATENING ON THE BREAK 
HOWARD MAKING THE SAVE HOW DID THAT GO WIDE 
UNBELIEVABLE THE LAW CROSS IN ALL 
YOU KUDU HAD TO DO WAS HIT THAT IN 
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ONE ZERO TO 
EVERTON WHAT NEXT GOODNESS ME JONES WITH THE SHAFT DAVID JONES 
REALLY DOES HIT THE SHOT WITH 
PLENTY OF POWER JONES WOULD BE 
SHOT A GOOD START TO THE SECOND 
HALF FROM DERBY 
AN INTERESTING 
HALF TIME TEAM TALK BY DAVID MOYES 
THEY WERE NOT AT THE RACES IN THE 
FIRST HALF FERNANDEZ WYNNE SAID AGAIN GOES 
FOR A GOAL WINS IT RIGHT ACROSS 
THE FACE OF THE GOLD FROM THE 
NIGERIAN INTERNATIONAL FERNANDEZ 
WITH A FIERCE SHOT THAT HAS BROUGHT THE GOODISON PARK CROWD TO LIFE A LOVELY UNCHALLENGED RUN IT IS 
LEON OSMAN A LOVELY ONE A 
BEAUTIFUL MOVE THROUGH THE METAL 
NOBODY TRACKED HIS RUN WHATSOEVER 
FERNANDEZ JUST HOLDING THE BALL UP 
ON THE NEARSIDE LOOK OUT OF MAN AS 
HE GOES THROUGH THE MIDDLE NOBODY 
TRACKED HIM EVERTON GET THE 
BREAKTHROUGH IT IS EVERTON ONE 
DERBY NELL NEIL IT IS A GREAT 
ATMOSPHERE AROUND THE PARK OSMAN LOOKING FOR A SECOND GOAL IT 
IS CLEARED OSMAN HOPING TO GET 
BOTH HIS AND EVERTON'S SECOND GOAL IS THERE ANY WAY BACK INTO THIS MATTER FOR PAUL JEWELL'S SIDE EVERTON WERE REALLY CAUGHT FLAT 
FOOTED AT THE BACK THERE HOWARD 
SAVING THE HOME TEAM THAT IS THREE GOOD CHANCES THAT 
LEON OSMAN HAS HAD IN THIS SECOND 
HALF JOLEON LESCOTT IT MUST SURELY HAVE 
THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE GOAL NUMBER 
NINE FOR HIM FOR DERBY GET A CORNER KICK ROY 
CARROLL HAVE COME UP INTO THE 
EVERTON HALF HAS COME UP IT IS ANOTHER CORNER TO DERBY YOU 
CAN SEE CARROLL IN 
THE PENALTY AREA LOOKING TO LATCH ON TO ANYTHING HEADED AWAY BY JAGIELKA FOUL IN THE AREA ANYWAY THAT IS SURELY DERBY'S LAST CHANCE GONE 
HOW BIG A GAME WAS THAT IN THE RACE 
FOR A FOURTH AND FIFTH PLACE 
HOPEFULLY THOSE THREE POINTS WILL 
MAKE IT HARDER FOR THE TEAM 
OYSTERCATCHERS AND HOPEFULLY WE 
CAN KEEP MORE PRESSURE ON LIVERPOOL 
ABOVE US FOR THE TEAM TO CATCH 
US IT WAS A BAD GOAL WE GAVE AWAY 
RIGHT TO THE HEART OF A DEFENCE 
BUT THERE IS A LOT FOR ME TO BE 
PLEASED ABOUT IN OUR PERFORMANCE 
WE KNEW IT WOULD BE A DIFFICULT 
GAME THE ONUS WAS ON ASKED TO COME 
OUT AND PUT THE PERFORMANCE IN AND 
GET THE THREE POINTS WAS ON ARCE 
IT WAS NOT A PRETTY FIRST HALF BUT 
WE IMPROVED QUITE A LOT AND WE 
CREATED QUITE FEW CHANCES IN THE 
SECOND HALF 
SIXTEEN POINTS THE BETTER 
IT WILL WE HAVE EVER HAD IS SIXTY ONE 
SIXTY POINTS L. AM HOPING TO SMASH UP 
THE WORDS COW'S BOTTOM AND BANJOS 
BRING TO MIND 
THE WORLD OF 
YAKUBU'S MISSES HE MADE A GREAT RUN HOW HE HAS 
MISSED HE MIGHT HAVE JUST LIFTED 
UP THE TURF GOOD FINISH OSMAN DOES COVER SOME 
GROUND SEVEN GOALS THIS SEASON IN 
THE ABSENCE OF CAHILL IT IS REALLY 
IMPORTANT THAT SHE COMES IN WITH 
GOALS FOR THEM IF THEY DON'T TO 
PITCH PUSH LIVERPOOL ALL THE WAY 
FOR THAT SPOT AND IT LOOKS LIKE 
THEY WILL 
YOU JUST WANT THEM TO DO 
IT 
DERBY ON THE OTHER HAND WHAT IT WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT THEM TWENTY SEVEN GAMES 
WITHOUT WINNING HE HAS GOT SOME 
WORK TO DO IF THEY GO DOWN THERE 
WAS NO GUARANTEE THEY WILL COME 
BACK 
THE REST OF YESTERDAY'S GOALS 
STARTING AT CRAVEN COTTAGE THIS WAS A MUST WIN GAME TO WIN ALL 
MUST WIN GAMES FULL FULHAM THEY 
DID NOTHING OF THE SORT SUNDERLAND MADE IT THREE VICTORIES 
ON THE BOUNCE 
THAT IS A GOOD 
HEADER AWAY DEFLECTED THROUGH AND 
SUNDERLAND TAKE THE LEAD AFTER FORTY FOUR 
MINUTES KENWYNE JONES WITH A HEADER RUN 
SHOP WRIGHT THE HALF TIME 
SUBSTITUTE HAS SURELY GIVEN 
SUNDERLAND A VICTORY LOVELY EFFORT KENWYNE JONES AND SUNDERLAND NOW 
HAVE SURELY ENDED ALL FULHAM 
RESISTANCE WITH THIS WIN HAVE A LOOK AT A BAD 
RUN BEHIND THEM AND POSSIBLY SOME 
EUROPEAN FOOTBALL IN FRONT OF THEM 
VILLA PUT BAD RUN BEHIND THEM 
FOR BOLTON THE FUTURE DOES NOT 
BEAR THINKING ABOUT GARETH BARRY ASTON VILLA LEAD BOLTON BY ONE GOAL TO NIL AGBONLAHOR WHAT A GOAL AND THE DEFLECTION CARRIED IT HOME HAS IT IS A GREAT CHANCE AND IT IS 
FOUR TO ZERO IT IS A GREAT CHANCE JUST JUST LIKE SUNDERLAND NEWCASTLE MADE IT 
THREE WINS ON THE BOUNCE WITH THE 
KIND OF SWASHBUCKLING TACTICS THAT 
REMIND EVERYONE WHY THEY LOVE KEVIN 
KEEGAN MARTIN KEEPS ON GOING AND SCORES FOR NEWCASTLE MICHAEL OWEN SCORES HE MAKES IT FOUR GOALS IN FOUR GAMES MARK VIDUKA HAVE NEWCASTLE THREE READING NIL STEVE BRUCE HAD THE SATISFACTION OF 
BEATING HIS FORMER EMPLOYERS WHILE 
ALEX MCLEISH HAD THE SATISFACTION 
OF NOT SLIPPING ANY FURTHER DENT TO 
BOLTON'S POOR RESULT 
TO 
BOLTON'S POOR RESULT WIGAN TOOK 
THE LEAD AFTER RECORD RAVAN HOUR 
VALENCIA TURNED MIKE MARTIN 
TAYLOR INSIDE OUT THE SKIPPER 
SEEMED TO LOSE HIS MARBLES 
LAUNCHING A TWO FOOTED ASSAULT ON 
KEVIN KILBANE WHO PETITIONED THE 
REFEREE FOR CLEMENCY BUT THE 
REFEREE WAS HAVING NONE OF IT AND 
OFF WENT DAMIEN JOHNSON AFTER JUST 
THIRTY SEVEN MINUTES WE CAN'S SECOND CAME 
AFTER VALENCIA SUPPLIED THE CROSS 
FOR SEVERAL PLAYERS TO HAVE A BASH 
AT SCORING BEFORE RYAN TAYLOR 
SQUEEZED IT IN WE CAN'S SECOND 
WE BEEN'S SECOND THIS MATCH 
BETWEEN THE BOTTOM OF THE TOP HALF 
OF THE TABLE AND THE TOP OF THE 
BOTTOM HALF PRODUCE A GAME OF 
PREDICTABLY MEDIOCRE QUALITY 
PRODUCED A GAME 
JERMAINE JENAS 
BERBATOV PUTS IT IN SUPER GOAL BY 
TOTTENHAM OH YES WHAT A GREAT EQUALISER BENTLEY HAS NOT GOT A PENALTY 
CLATTERING INTO THE 
SUBSTITUTE THE BRAZILIAN GILBERTO 
NOTHING GIVEN 
THE REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT THERE IS 
SUNDERLAND LAST WEEK AFTER THE ONE 
TWO GAMES YOU SAID THIRD ONE 
WOULD BE A MIRACLE AND IT CAME TO 
PASS AFTER THEIR WON TWO GAMES 
THEY HAVE PLAYED ENOUGH GOOD 
FOOTBALL AND ROY KEANE HAS 
ADDRESSED CERTAIN PROBLEMS IT HAS 
BEEN A GOOD WEEKEND FOR THE NORTH 
EAST AND NEWCASTLE TURNED IT ROUND 
AS WELL 
IT IS INTERESTING US 
INTERESTING ROY KEANE SAYING THEY 
ARE STILL NOT SAFE TEN POINTS FROM 
BOTTOM THEY ARE SAFE BIRMINGHAM I 
THINK WILL SURVIVE BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE THREE HOME GAMES AND THERE ARE 
NOT BAD AT HOME AND BOLTON HAVE 
GOT THREE AWAY GAMES AND CANNOT WIN 
AWAY FROM HOME SO I THINK THEY ARE 
DOOMED 
DO YOU GIVE ANY HOPE TO DOOMED FULHAM 
NO AT THE THREE WHO ARE FULHAM DOWN THERE ARE GOING TO STAY DOWN 
THERE IS TOO BIG A GAP AND NO FORM 
THE NEWCASTLE AND SUNDERLAND DERBY 
WILL BE QUITE A BIG GAME 
IT ALWAYS 
IS KEEGAN WILL WANT THEM TO FINISH 
WELL SO THEY GO INTO NEXT SEASON 
HIS AIM WOULD HAVE BEEN SURVIVE 
THIS SEASON AND TAKE OFF NEXT 
SEASON 
LET'S FINISH OFF WITH TWO SEASON GOOD TWO BAD 
A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR THE LADIES 
THE BODY SHAPE IS NOT GOOD FOR THIS 
BIRMINGHAM CITY FAN BUT IF YOU LIKE 
THE HAIRLESS LOOK THERE IS NOT A 
SPOT OF HAIR ON THERE MELLBERG 
THROW IN BASIC ERROR A SCHOOLBOY

LOOK AT JAIDI'S COMEDY DIVE
