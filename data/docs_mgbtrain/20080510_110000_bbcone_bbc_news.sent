THEY ARE NOW IN A RACE AGAINST TIME 
TO PREVENT DISEASE AND STARVATION 
TAKING HOLD IN THE CYCLONE HIT 
AREAS OF BURMA IT'S BEEN A WEEK 
SINCE THE DISASTER STRUCK BUT AID 
FOR THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF 
SURVIVORS IS STILL ONLY TRICKLING 
INTO THE COUNTRY BURMA'S MILITARY 
LEADERS HAVE GONE AHEAD ABOUT A 
REFERENDUM ON A NEW CONSTITUTION 
WE REPORT FROM NEIGHBOURING 
THAILAND THAILAND THE IRRAWADDY DELTA A WEEK AFTER 
THE CYCLONE NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED 
THE PEOPLE WHO SURVIVED THIS 
DISASTER NEED EVERYTHING FOOD 
SHELTER MEDICAL TREATMENT AND THEY 
ARE GETTING VERY LITTLE A LOCAL 
CLINIC THERE IS NO POWER AND THE 
STAFF ARE OVERWHELMED DEALING WITH 
DISEASE INJURIES AND BIRTHS 
THE HEALTH OF YOUNG CHILDREN IS A 
SERIOUS CONCERN NOW THE SITUATION 
IS REALLY OUT OF CONTROL TOO MANY 
PEOPLE AND VERY LITTLE HELP WE 
HAVE TO ORGANISE WITH THE HIGHER 
AUTHORITIES TO ARRANGE FOR THE FOOD 
SHELTER AND MEDICINE AND SANITATION 
BUT THE HIGHER AUTHORITIES ARE TOO 
BUSY WITH THE REFERENDUM WHICH THEY 
ARE ALMOST GUARANTEED TO WIN TOP 
GENERAL HAS BEEN ALMOST INVISIBLE 
IN THIS CRISIS BUT HE DID SHOW UP 
TO VOTE HE IS SEEN HERE HANDING 
OUT HELP TO THE CYCLONE'S VICTIMS 
BUT THE REALITY IS DIFFERENT 
INTERNATIONAL IS TRICKLING IN AND 
THE DISASTER EXPERTS NEEDED TO 
DISTRIBUTE IT ARE BEING KEPT OUT 
TWO PLANES WENT IN FROM THAILAND 
TODAY THE UN HOPES TO SEND IN 
ANOTHER THREE IT'S NO WHERE NEAR 
ENOUGH ZIMBABWE'S OPPOSITION 
LEADER TSVANGIRAI HAS SAID HE 
WILL TAKE PART IN A PRESIDENTIAL 
RUN OFF AGAINST ROBERT MUGABE BUT 
HE HAS LAID OUT CONDITIONS FOR A 
SECOND VOTE SAYING IT MUST HAPPEN 
WITHIN TWO WEEKS AND THAT 
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS AND THE 
MEDIA MUST BE GIVEN FULL ACCESS 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI MADE HIS REMARKS 
IN SOUTH AFRICA L. AM JOINED BY OUR 
CORRESPONDENT THERE WHAT DID HE 
SAY HE SAID HE WOULD BE RETURNED 
TO ZIMBABWE TO FIGHT A SECOND ROUND 
HE SAID HE WAS BRAVE ENOUGH AND 
THAT THE NATION WAS BRAVE ENOUGH 
HE SAID HE WAS READY HE SAID THAT 
THE PEOPLE WERE ANGRY ENOUGH TO GO 
BACK TO THE POLLS HE SAID THIS 
WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 
ZIMBABWEANS TO LIBERATE THEMSELVES 
FROM THEIR FORMER LIBERATOR HE 
SAID IT COULD BE A CHANCE TO KNOCK 
OUT THE DICTATOR AS HE CALLED 
ROBERT MUGABE FOR GOOD BUT THE 
KEY THINGS ARE THE CONDITIONS WHICH 
HE ATTACHED QUITE A LONG LISTING 
SAYING HE WANTED TO HAVE OBSERVERS 
FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
GIVEN UNFETERED ACCESS HE WANTED 
TO SEE PEACEKEEPER COMING FROM THE 
SOUTHERN AFRICAN COMMUNITY AND HE 
WANTED TO SEE AN END TO ALL 
VIOLENCE THOSE ARE CONDITIONS 
WHICH WILL NOT BE MET WE HAVE 
ALREADY HAD A STATEMENT FROM 
ZIMBABWE'S JUSTICE MINISTER SAYING 
THAT NO EXTRA CONDITIONS WILL BE 
ACCEPTED AND THE RUN OFF WILL TAKE 
PLACE ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION 
TONY BLAIR IS ADVISING GORDON BROWN 
ON HOW TO WIN THE NEXT ELECTION 
THAT IS ACCORDING TO CHERIE BLAIR 
WHOSE AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS BEING 
SERIALISED IN THE TIMES AND SUN 
NEWSPAPERS SHE ALSO SUGGESTS THAT 
MR. BROWN WAS RATTLING THE KEYS OF 
DOWNING STREET IN THE HOPE OF 
GETTING MR. BLAIR OUT OF OFFICE 
BEFORE THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE ELECTIONS 
THOUSANDS OF SCHOOL CHILDREN MAY 
SUFFER WHAT TEACHING UNIONS ARE 
CALLING EXAM CONGESTION IN THE NEXT 
FEW WEEKS SOME PUPILS WILL SPEND 
UP TO SEVEN HOURS SITTING EXAMS IN 
A SINGLE DAY THE NATIONAL UNION OF 
TEACHERS IS CALLING ON THE EXAM 
BOARDS TO CO ORDINATE THEIR 
SCHEDULES MORE EFFECTIVELY NPOWER 
MUST GET A GRIP AND STAMP OUT THE 
MISSELLING WHICH IS ENDEMIC AMONGST 
ITS SALES TEAM THAT IS ACCORDING 
TO THE ENERGY WATCHDOG ENERGYWATCH 
IT'S TOLD THE B. B. C. IT'S GETTING SEVENTY PER CENT 
MORE COMPLAINTS ABOUT NPOWER 
SELLING THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY 
WITH TACTICS LIKE PRETENDING TO BE 
A RIVAL FIRM OR NEEDING ACCESS TO 
READ THE METRE 
NEIL SIMPSON IS CHAIRMAN OF A LOCAL 
RESIDENT ASSOCIATION HE HAS 
EXPERIENCED NPOWER'S HARD SELLING 
TACTICS SO HAVE MANY OF HIS 
NEIGHBOURS 
THE MANNER THAT WAS NEIGHBOURS DESCRIBED TO ME WAS QUITE 
AGGRESSIVE IN YOUR FACE AND 
WOULDN'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER 
EVEN PEOPLE WHO WERE SAYING LOOK I 
AM REALLY NOT INTERESTED BUT THEY 
WOULD NOT GIVE UP 
AFTER A 
NEWSPAPER INVESTIGATION REVEALED 
MISSELLING BY SOME OF ITS STAFF 
NPOWER DISMISSED A HANDFUL OF ITS 
AGENTS IN SOUTH LONDON BUT THE 
PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE NATIONWIDE 
THE GAS AND ELECTRICITY WATCHDOG 
ENERGYWATCH SAID IT'S HAD SEVENTY PER CENT MORE 
COMPLAINTS ABOUT NPOWER'S SALES 
THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY 
THE FIGURES 
HAVE BEEN RISING STEADILY IN TERMS 
OF THE NUMBER OF CASES WE HAVE HAD 
AGAINST NPOWER ABOUT MISSELLING 
SINCE LAST AUTUMN LAST MONTH WOULD 
BE THE HIGHEST WE HAVE RECEIVED 
AGAINST THEM SO WHAT WE WOULD 
EXPECT IS NPOWER TO STEP OUT OF 
DENIAL AND QUITE FRANKLY GET TO 
GRIPS WITH THE MISSELLING OF THEIR 
AGENTS IN THE FIELD AND PUTTING A 
STOP TO IT 
NPOWER TOLD THE B. B. C. IT WAS CO 
OPERATING FULLY WITH THE REGULATOR 
OFGEM'S INVESTIGATION AND IS ALSO 
CARRYING OUT ITS OWN INQUIRY THEY 
SAY PROVEN COMPLAINTS ACCOUNT FOR 
ONLY SMALL PROACTION OF THEIR 
SALES ACTIVITY FRACTION
