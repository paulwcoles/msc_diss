WELCOME TO BATH WHERE WE'RE HOPING TO CLEAN UP ON FLOG IT 
THE ROMANS NAMED BATH BATH BECAUSE OF ITS NATURAL HOT SPRINGS THE ONLY ONES IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY 
THEY HAVE PROVED POPULAR TO THE WEALTHY WHO HAVE FLOCKED TO THE SPA EVER SINCE 
I KNOW WHAT YOU ALL WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT'S IT WORTH 
TODAY'S VALUATION COMES FROM THE BATH PAVILLION 
WHICH HAS A RICH CULTURAL HISTORY ALL OF ITS OWN 
THE BEATLES THE WHO OASIS AND EVEN THE WORZELS HAVE ALL PLAYED HERE AT THE PAVILLION 
TODAY OUR EXPERTS CATHERINE SOUTHON AND JETHRO MARLES WILL BE CALLING THE TUNE 
IN A CITY AS HISTORIC AND WELL TO DO AS THIS ONE ALMOST ANYTHING CAN COME THROUGH THE DOOR 
SO MICK YOU'VE GOT A BLANK SPACE ON YOUR WALL SOMEWHERE HAVE YOU 
WELL NO IT'S NOT BEEN HANGING ON MY WALL IT'S MY MOTHER'S PICTURE 
IT'S BEEN IN THE LOFT WITH A LOT OF MY GREAT AUNT'S STUFF 
THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HER HOUSE 
SO IT'S JUST BEEN STASHED AWAY IN THE LOFT STASHED AWAY IN THE LOFT 
IS SHE THINKING OF SELLING IT YES SHE IS 
FIRST OF ALL LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE SCENE 
IT'S AN EARLY MOTORWAY SCENE WITH SOMEONE HAVING A PICNIC 
THEY'RE THE PEOPLE IN THE LAY BY AND YOU'RE SAYING WHY ARE YOU STOPPING THERE 
IT'S A STUPID PLACE FOR A PICNIC 
BUT ACTUALLY IT MUST HAVE BEEN LOVELY JUST THERE MUSTN'T IT 
MOTHER IS POURING THE TEA BUT THEY LOOK EXHAUSTED 
THEY'VE OBVIOUSLY BEEN WALKING 
AND HAVEN'T HAD ANY TRANSPORT OF THEIR OWN 
AND THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE DISTANCE 
GOING UP WITH THE PONY AND TRAP 
THAT'S PROBABLY QUITE A BUSY HIGHWAY IN THOSE DAYS ISN'T IT 
IT IS THAT LOOKS LIKE RUSH HOUR TO ME 
THE ARTIST IS WILLIAM CHARLES EDDINGTON 
HE WAS A WATERCOLOUR ARTIST WORKING IN THE LATTER PART OF THE VICTORIAN PERIOD BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT TO EIGHTY FIVE 
IT IS A WATERCOLOUR 
ALTHOUGH HE WAS VERY COMPETENT 
YOU WOULDN'T STAND BACK AND SAY HE WAS THE FINEST OF PAINTERS 
BUT THE SCENES THAT HE DEPICTED WERE OFTEN FARMLAND SCENES 
LOCAL DOMESTIC SCENES THAT SORT OF THING 
OFTEN OUT IN THE OPEN AIR JUST LIKE THIS ONE 
WHEN IT COMES TO VALUE WHICH I KNOW IS WHAT YOU'RE WANTING TO KNOW IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO ACREAGE 
WHAT SIZE IS THE PICTURE BASICALLY 
IT'S QUITE A NICE LITTLE SCENE SOME MIGHT SAY IT'S ALMOST CHOCOLATE BOX 
DOES IT APPEAL TO YOU NO I ACTUALLY DON'T LIKE THE EXECUTION 
I THINK IT'S QUITE CHILDISH 
IT'S NOT THE FINEST DETAIL BUT IT IS WATERCOLOUR DON'T FORGET 
YEAH IT'S THE OVERALL EFFECT 
YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY WANT TO LOOK TOO CLOSELY AT ANY WATERCOLOUR 
YOU WANT TO LOOK AT A WATERCOLOUR FROM A DISTANCE 
SO ON THE SIZE OF THIS PICTURE HERE LOOKING AT THE RECORDS OF EDDINGTON'S WORK THAT'S BEEN SOLD IN THE PAST 
IT OUGHT TO BE WORTH SOMETHING IN THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY RIGHT 
ESTIMATING IT PERHAPS AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED 
RESERVE AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY AND MAYBE WITH A BIT OF DISCRETION IT'S UP TO YOU 
BUT I THINK IT WILL MAKE ITS PRICE IN THE AUCTION 
WITH PAINTINGS LIKE THIS THE AUCTION IS GOING TO BE ON THE INTERNET 
SO IT'S GOING TO MAKE ITS VALUE ON THE DAY 
SHALL WE PUT IT IN THE AUCTION I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A VERY NICE PIECE OF TREEN 
A NICE LITTLE SNUFF BOOT 
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT WHERE IT CAME FROM 
IT CAME FROM MY MOTHER'S HOUSE 
HAVE YOU HAD IT IN YOUR FAMILY A LONG TIME YES 
IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU LIKE PARTICULARLY 
NOT PARTICULARLY NO YOU'RE NOT ATTRACTED TO IT NO 
THESE SORT OF THINGS ARE VERY COLLECTIBLE 
BUT TREEN COLLECTORS ARE PARTICULARLY FUSSY ABOUT IT 
THEY DO HAVE TO BE IN VERY GOOD CONDITION 
UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE AWARE BUT THERE IS A BIT OF DAMAGE HERE 
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHEN THIS DAMAGE OCCURRED 
NO I'M AFRAID NOT SORRY JUST WHEN YOU SAW IT THIS IS THE DAMAGE THAT YOU SAW 
IT IS A VERY NICE SNUFFBOX 
YOU CAN JUST SEE THE TOP OF IT SLIDES OFF HERE 
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY WHERE ALL THE SNUFF WOULD HAVE BEEN STORED 
WHAT I DO LIKE ABOUT IT IS ALL THE LOVELY LITTLE STUDS HERE 
AND THE BEAUTIFUL PATTERNS THAT WE CAN SEE ALL OVER 
NOT ONLY IS THERE A PATTERN ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE BOOT BUT AS WE TURN 
IT OVER THERE'S ALSO A PATTERN ACROSS THE SOLES AND ON THE HEELS 
WHAT MATERIAL IS THAT THE ACTUAL MATERIAL OF THE WOOD IS MAHOGANY 
THEY WERE MADE IN ALL SORTS ASH SATINWOOD 
BUT THIS PARTICULAR BOOT IS IN MAHOGANY 
UNFORTUNATELY THE DAMAGE REALLY DOES AFFECT THE VALUE 
THE VALUE HAS DROPPED CONSIDERABLY 
WITHOUT THE DAMAGE IN PERFECT ORDER YOU WOULD BE LOOKING AT A COUPLE OF HUNDRED POUNDS 
IN THIS CONDITION UNFORTUNATELY WE DO HAVE TO ASK FOR ABOUT SIXTY TO EIGHTY 
HOW DOES THAT SOUND THAT SOUNDS ALL RIGHT 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT YES 
FOR SOMEBODY WHO DIDN'T REALLY LIKE IT YOU'VE DONE ALL RIGHT YES THAT'S RIGHT 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT ALONG TO A GOOD AUCTION ROOM 
SO I HOPE THERE'S SOME TREEN COLLECTORS THERE 
AND I HOPE THAT THERE'S SOME TREEN COLLECTORS WHO AREN'T SO FUSSY 
AND THAT IT DOES WELL AND MAKES LOTS OF MONEY FOR YOU 
JONATHAN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS IN 
IT'S A LOVELY EARTHENWARE JUG 
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS BECAUSE FLOG IT HAS TAUGHT ME ALL ABOUT IT 
I'M PLEASED ABOUT THAT 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS NO IDEA 
IT'S AN ELTONWARE JUG RIGHT 
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH ELTONWARE IS MADE IN CLEVEDON 
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE WE'RE GOING FOR THE AUCTION 
LUCKY FOR ME 
SO THERE'S A REALLY NICE CORRELATION GOING ON HERE 
IT WAS MADE BY EDMUND ELTON THE MAD BARON POTTER 
AS WITH ALL ELTONWARE IT'S ALWAYS SIGNED UNDERNEATH 
ELTON HE LIVED AT CLEVEDON COURT 
AND HE'S GOT A POTTERY RIGHT IN HIS GROUNDS 
AND WE FILMED THERE FOR FLOG IT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO 
OH RIGHT IT'S AN EARTHENWARE VESSEL 
THE TECHNIQUE IS WITH A CLEAR GLAZE 
BUT WITH COLOURED SLIPS 
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO HEAVY AND WHY IT CHIPS EASILY 
HE CALLED HIS POTTERY ALMOST LIKE SUNFLOWER POTTERY THE SUNFLOWER STUDIOS 
YOU CAN SEE AROUND THE FOOT OF THE VESSEL 
THEY'RE VERY FAINT AREN'T THEY THERE'S VERY FAINT SUNFLOWERS 
BUT IT IS SUCH A CHARMING PIECE 
THE POTTERY WAS AROUND FROM ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE RIGHT UP TO NINETEEN THIRTY 
I PUT THIS PIECE AT ABOUT NINETEEN TEN 
THAT OLD YES OH GOSH 
IS IT FOR MILK OR 
IT'S JUST A JUG YEAH YEAH IT COULD BE IT'S JUST A LOVELY JUG 
A LITTLE PITCHER O. K. 
IT'S MORE OF A STATEMENT OF SCULPTURE REALLY THAN A FUNCTIONAL PIECE 
IT COULD BE USED BUT IT WAS PART OF THE ART MOVEMENT 
RIGHT YES WELL I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT 
VERY BIG AMONGST STUDIO POTTERY COLLECTORS RIGHT 
THIS IS SOUNDING GOOD I'M DIGGING THIS UP AREN'T I 
YOU WERE GONNA SAY ALL RIGHT PAUL GET ON WITH IT LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS 
YEAH HOW MUCH YEAH HOW MUCH WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH 
UM EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED 
I THINK WE COULD DOUBLE THAT REALLY 
YES ESPECIALLY WHERE WE'RE GOING THE CLEVEDON SALEROOMS 
A LOT OF LOCAL INTEREST 
I'D LIKE TO PUT THIS INTO AUCTION WITH A VALUATION OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED 
THAT SOUNDS GOOD CAN I PUT A RESERVE ON IT 
YOU CAN PUT A RESERVE ON IT 
UM ONE HUNDRED FORTY YES WELL WE'LL LET THE AUCTIONEER USE HIS DISCRETION ON THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
WHICH WOULD POSSIBLY TAKE IT TO ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE 
RIGHT WOULD THAT BE O. K. THAT'S FINE 
WHY DO YOU WANT TO SELL SUCH A CHOICE PIECE 
AND A VERY RARE PIECE AS WELL 
WELL IT MAY BE THAT BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T LIKE IT 
MY WIFE REALLY DOESN'T LIKE IT 
I DON'T MIND IT BUT SHE JUST WANTS IT OUT THE HOUSE YEAH 
SHE'S BEEN THREATENING TO THROW IT AWAY QUITE A FEW TIMES REALLY 
I THINK IT'S GOT TO GO IT'S GOT TO GO THINK OF THE MONEY 
I KNOW ABSOLUTELY 
I THINK IT'S GOT EVERYTHING GOING FOR IT I REALLY DO 
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT THIS DOES WITH ALL THE LOCAL INTEREST 
BRING IT ON BRING IT ON 
JOHN AND LINDA WHICH OF YOU ARE THE REAL OWNERS OF THESE VASES 
WELL THEY'VE COME DOWN THROUGH MY FAMILY FROM MY GRANDMOTHER 
SOME OF MY EARLIEST MEMORIES ARE SEEING THESE IN MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE 
NOW YOU'RE THINKING OF SELLING THEM YES 
I'VE HAD THEM FOR THREE YEARS NOW 
THEY'VE BEEN WRAPPED UP IN THE GARAGE 
THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO STAY THERE BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T FIT IN OUR MODERN HOUSE 
LINDA YOU DON'T FANCY KEEPING THESE 
I THINK WE'VE GOT THE WRONG HOUSE ALTOGETHER THEY'RE SUCH AN IMPOSING SIZE REALLY 
VERY DECORATIVE BUT JUST NOT FOR US 
THEY NEED THE RIGHT SPOT AND YOU DON'T HAVE IT 
WE'RE GONNA FIND SOMEONE WHO DOES THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL 
D'YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE ACTUAL POTS THEMSELVES 
ONLY BECAUSE THEY SAY TORQUAY ON THE BOTTOM I IMAGINE THEY ARE TORQUAY WARE 
THE THING ABOUT TORQUAY WARE IS THAT IT IS A LITTLE BIT A MINEFIELD 
AS SOON AS PEOPLE SAY TORQUAY WARE YOU THINK EVERYTHING'S AROUND THERE 
AND IT SORT OF IS BUT LOTS OF FACTORIES CROPPED UP AT DIFFERENT TIMES 
YOU'VE GOT ALLER VALE BOVEY TRACEY WATCOMBE POTTERY LONGPARK ALL OF THESE 
IF YOU GET IT WRONG THERE ARE A LOT OF VERY KEEN COLLECTORS OUT THERE 
WHO VERY SOON WILL LET US KNOW 
SO LET'S TURN THEM UP AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE MARKS YOU'VE DESCRIBED ON THE BASE 
THIS SAYS LEMON AND CRUTE TORQUAY 
RIGHT LEMON AND CRUTE WERE A FACTORY DOWN ON THE TEIGNMOUTH ROAD AREA OF TORQUAY 
I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I WAS BORN IN TORQUAY 
THE CHAP CALLED FREDERICK WILLIAM CRUTE WHO WAS THE OWNER OF THE MARBLE WORKS THERE 
WENT INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH THOMAS LEMON IN THE LATE NINETEEN TWENTIES 
THEY SET UP THE TOR VALE POTTERY AND PRODUCED WHAT YOU CALL TORQUAY WARE 
ANYONE WHO COLLECTS TORQUAY WARE WILL RECOGNISE THESE KAMIKAZE KINGFISHERS 
BECAUSE THEY WERE PRODUCED NOT BY JUST THIS ONE FACTORY 
BUT OTHERS AS WELL IN THE TORQUAY AREA 
THEY ARE VERY TYPICAL OF THE TORQUAY WARES OF THIS TIME TORQUAY WARES 
IN THEIR PAST HISTORY USED TO PRODUCE MAGNIFICENT THINGS 
MAGNIFICENT MARBLE ESQUE TYPE STATUARY AND PIECES LIKE THAT 
THEN LATER ON THEY PRODUCED THE VERY COMMONLY KNOWN MOTTO WARE 
BUT I LOVE THIS SORT OF WARE WHICH IS BETWEEN THE TWO 
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF CRAZING APPEARING 
AND THAT'S JUST THE NATURAL PROCESS 
OF MOVEMENT BETWEEN THE CLAY AND THE GLAZE ITSELF 
SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS AS SOON AS YOU TAKE SOMETHING OUT OF THE KILN 
IF YOU TAKE IT OUT TOO QUICKLY YOU GET THIS CRACKLING EFFECT 
YOU'VE GOT A PAIR OF VASES 
AND THEY'RE ALL SIGNED EXACTLY THE SAME LEMON AND CRUTE TORQUAY 
THEN YOU'VE GOT THIS INDIVIDUAL VASE IN THE MIDDLE 
I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO GET FOR THE PAIR OF THESE 
LARGE SLENDER VASES SOMETHING BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
OH RIGHT 
AND PROBABLY FOR THIS SQUAT GLOBULAR ONE 
SOMETHING BETWEEN FIFTY AND SEVENTY 
ON THE BASIS OF THOSE FIGURES WOULD YOU BE HAPPY TO GO AHEAD 
ABSOLUTELY THAT'S MORE THAN WE EXPECTED 
IF WE PUT RESERVES AT ONE HUNDRED ON THE PAIR AND FIFTY ON THE GLOBULAR VASE YOU'RE HAPPY TO PUT THEM IN 
THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME FABULOUS BRILLIANT 
IT'S NOT QUITE THE M. TWENTY FIVE 
BUT MICK HAS BROUGHT IN AN EARLY MOTORWAY PAINTING 
CAN THE BIDDERS SNIFF OUT A BARGAIN WITH JENNY'S SNUFF BOOT 
THEY'RE BIG AND THEY'RE BOLD AND THERE'S THREE TORQUAY WARE VASES 
AND I LOVE THIS ELTONWARE JUG MADE CLOSE BY IN CLEVEDON 
WHICH IS HANDY AS OUR AUCTION ROOMS ARE THE CLEVEDON SALEROOMS IN NORTH SOMERSET 
I'VE FOUND SOMETHING RIGHT UP MY STREET 
THIS IS A CRACKING LOT 
IT'S LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IT'S WELSH OAK IT'S DEAR TO MY HEART 
I JUST CAN CARESS THIS WOOD ALL DAY LONG 
IT'S GOT THE MOST WONDERFUL COLOUR HUE AND PATINA 
THAT'S CENTURIES' WORTH OF DIRT JUST BUILT UP THAT LAYER OF WAX CREATING A SKIN 
WHICH IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR WHEN YOU'RE BUYING ANTIQUE OAK FURNITURE 
IT'S A CLASSIC FIELDED BACK PANELLED SETTLE 
UNDERNEATH THE SEAT THERE'S A COUPLE OF LOCKER DRAWERS WITH ORIGINAL HANDLES 
IT IS GORGEOUS BUT THERE IS A SECRET TO THIS SETTLE 
IT'S KNOWN IN THE TRADE AS A BACON SETTLE IF I SPIN IT ROUND 
WEIGHS A TON FIELDED PANELS ALL THE WAY ROUND EVEN ON THE BACK 
AND THE BACK REVEALS A COUPLE OF DOORS 
THIS WOULD BE IN A HALLWAY OR KITCHEN AND IT WOULD BE USED 
FOR HANGING YOUR PHEASANT AND YOUR GAME IN 
ISN'T THAT LOVELY 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE 
I COULD TAKE THIS HOME BUT IT'S NOT IN TODAY'S SALE 
IT'S COMING UP IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME IN THEIR FINE ART SALE 
IF YOU WANT TO BUY THIS IT'S GONNA SET YOU BACK AROUND FOUR GRAND 
LET'S SEE IF AUCTIONEER MARC BURRIDGE CAN DO THE BUSINESS TODAY 
WE'VE GOT A LOVELY WATERCOLOUR FOR YOU 
IT'S AN EARLY MOTORWAY SCENE IT BELONGS TO MICK 
IS HE ON THE RIGHT ROAD AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED THAT'S THE VALUATION 
THIS HAS BEEN IN THE FAMILY A LONG TIME YOU DON'T LIKE IT NO NOT ME SO YOU'RE FLOGGING IT 
I'M FLOGGING IT FOR MY MUM YEAH 
THIS IS THE FIRST AUCTION MICK'S EVER BEEN TO 
SO COME ON WHAT D'YOU THINK 
IT'S FANTASTIC I FANCY HAVING A BID ON A FEW THINGS MYSELF 
I DON'T BLAME YOU THERE'S SOME CRACKING STUFF HERE JETHRO WILL WE GET THE TOP END 
I HOPE WE'LL GET THE BOTTOM END AND ANYTHING OVER THAT IS A BONUS 
IF WE GET THE TOP END EVEN BETTER 
IF WE CAN GO OVER THE TOP END EVEN BETTER THAN THAT IT'S VALUE FOR MONEY 
IT'S AN ORIGINAL YOU CAN'T GO WRONG REALLY 
I PERSONALLY WOULD KEEP THIS I KINDA LIKE IT

FANTASTIC RESULT THANK YOU JETHRO FANTASTIC 
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY YOU GET TO MAKE A FILM ABOUT ONE OF YOUR SCHOOLBOY HEROES 
I'M GOING TO NIP DOWN THE ROAD TO THE BRISTOL DOCKS TO TELL YOU ABOUT ONE OF MINE 
THERE IS ONE MAN WHO ARGUABLY HAD THE GREATEST IMPACT ON THE WEST COUNTRY 
AND WAS VOTED THE SECOND GREATEST BRITON EVER 
BEATEN ONLY BY WINSTON CHURCHILL 
HIS NAME ISAMBARD KINGDOM BRUNEL 
BRUNEL IS NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH GREAT ENGINEERING FEATS SUCH AS RAILWAYS OR BRIDGES 
BUT HE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN AND NOT ONLY DID HE WANT TO BRING RAIL PASSENGERS FROM LONDON TO BRISTOL 
BUT HE ALSO WANTED TO LET THEM CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY TO GIVE THEM THE OPTION TO SAIL TO NEW YORK 
FOR THIS PURPOSE HE BUILT A VESSEL 
AND IN ITS DAY IT WAS THE BIGGEST VESSEL EVER TO BE BUILT AND IT WAS CALLED S. S. GREAT BRITAIN 
YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE STANDING ON THE DECKS OF THIS SHIP TO APPRECIATE THE ENORMOUS SCALE OF IT 
IT IS MASSIVE AND IT DOES FILL ME FULL OF EXCITEMENT RIGHT NOW WHICH MAKES ME WONDER WHAT WAS 
GOING THROUGH THE MINDS OF THE PASSENGERS AS THEY SET SAIL FOR AMERICA IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
FULL OF HOPE AND ANTICIPATION THERE IS A WHOLE NEW WORLD OUT THERE 
S. S. GREAT BRITAIN IS NOW ONE OF THE PREMIER TOURIST ATTRACTIONS IN THE WEST COUNTRY 
IT'S HOUSED RIGHT HERE IN BRISTOL IN THE DRY DOCK WHERE SHE WAS BUILT GREAT WESTERN DOCKYARD 
TO FIND OUT A LITTLE MORE ABOUT HER I'VE COME TO MEET JO BAKER WHOSE PART OF THE S. S. GREAT BRITAIN TRUST 
HI JO HI PAUL SHE MUST HAVE BEEN AN ENGINEERING MARVEL IN HER DAY 
OH SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY COMBINED AN IRON HULL WITH A SCREW PROPELLER 
ALTHOUGH THESE SORTS OF SHIPS WERE ABOUT IT WAS THE FIRST TIME 
THE TWO HAD BEEN PUT TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH SUCH A BIG SHIP 
SO BRUNEL WAS DEFINITELY AHEAD OF HIS TIME 
OH ABSOLUTELY YES HE WAS A GENIUS 
YOU CAN COMPARE THIS TO CONCORDE WHICH WAS JUST RECENTLY IN ITS DAY JUST AS FUTURISTIC 
ABSOLUTELY IT WAS THE QUICKEST WAY TO TRAVEL 
WERE ALL THE LOCAL PEOPLE OR INDEED THE PEOPLE THROUGHOUT GREAT BRITAIN 
SCEPTICAL OF WHAT WAS GOING ON A BIG HEAVY HULL THAT MAY NOT FLOAT 
ABSOLUTELY IT'S MADE OF METAL 
MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WOOD FLOATED AND METAL SINKS 
SO THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT SUCH A THING WAS POSSIBLE 
OBVIOUSLY WHEN IT CAME TO CARRYING ALL THE PASSENGERS 
SHE NEVER ACTUALLY FILLED HER QUOTA OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PASSENGERS OVER TO AMERICA 
NEVER EVER NO SO THESE PASSENGERS WERE GUINEA PIGS AND THEY WERE A BIT SCEPTICAL ABSOLUTELY 
BUT OBVIOUSLY SHE BROUGHT LOTS OF LOCAL EMPLOYMENT 
SHE DID INDEED SHE WAS BUILT IN THIS VERY DRY DOCK 
THERE WERE THREE THOUSAND MEN WORKING ON HER SO THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
CARPENTERS METAL WORKERS ALL FROM THE LOCAL AREA 
OF COURSE IT WAS A BIG HOLIDAY WHEN SHE WAS LAUNCHED FROM THE DRY DOCK 
EVERYBODY CAME TO SEE SUCH A MARVELLOUS SHIP BEING LAUNCHED 
WHAT A WONDERFUL VESSEL I PERSONALLY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SAILED ON HER 
YOU'RE BRAVER THAN ME 
BRUNEL DID A SERIES OF STUDIES WHICH PROVED THAT A LARGER VESSEL 
COULD COVER A GREATER DISTANCE WITH LESS ENERGY THAN A SMALLER VESSEL 
SO HE DESIGNED S. S. GREAT BRITAIN 
LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY ENOUGH COAL TO DO A SINGLE TRANSATLANTIC CROSSING 
AND OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T BUILD A BOAT THIS SIZE WHICH IS IMMENSE OUT OF WOOD 
IT HAD TO BE BUILT OUT OF IRON WHICH IS TWENTY TWO YEARS BEFORE STEEL WAS INVENTED 
ALL OF THESE IRON PLATES WERE FORGED AT THE COLEBROOK DOWN FOUNDRY IN SHROPSHIRE AND SHIPPED DOWN HERE 
OBVIOUSLY IT'S PRONE TO EROSION 
BUT LUCKILY WITH SOME CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY AND SOME MODERN DEHUMIDIFIERS 
IT ACTUALLY IS SLOWING THE PROCESS RIGHT DOWN 
BRUNEL INTENDED THE S. S. GREAT BRITAIN TO BE DESIGNED WITH HUGE GREAT BIG 
PADDLE WHEELS JUST LIKE HIS FIRST VESSEL THE GREAT WESTERN 
BUT HE CHANGED HIS MIND WHEN HE SAW ANOTHER VESSEL BEING FITTED WITH A SCREW PROPELLER HERE IN BRISTOL 
HE GOT THE GREAT WESTERN STEEL COMPANY TO CHANGE THEIR PLANS 
AND HIS COLLEAGUE THOMAS GUPPY HAD TO REDESIGN THE ENGINES 
THIS IS THE RESULT LOOK AT THAT WHAT A PROPELLER 
AND THIS WAS CONSIDERED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY THREE TO BE CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY 
AND TO TELL YOU HOW EFFICIENT IT IS AND HOW PRACTICAL IT WAS 
TODAY'S MODERN PROPELLERS ARE ONLY FIVE PER CENT MORE EFFICIENT THAN THIS ONE 
SADLY A GREAT ENGINEERING GENIUS LIKE BRUNEL EVEN GOT A FEW IDEAS WRONG 
ONE OF THEM WAS HIS MAST SYSTEM 
NOW HE DESIGNED THE MAST TO BE HINGED AT THE VERY BOTTOM LIKE THIS 
SO THEY SAT ON THE DECK 
THE PROBLEM WAS THESE MASTS WEIGHED AN ABSOLUTE TON AND LOOKING UP THERE 
RIGHT UP INTO THE HEAVENS THAT'S SOME NINETY TWO F. T. IN HEIGHT 
IT'S NO WONDER THE SYSTEM WAS DOOMED 
IT WAS SO HEAVY THE CREWMEN JUST COULDN'T PULL THEM BACK UP AGAIN 
AND INCIDENTALLY THESE MASTS ARE KNOWN AS MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY 
THURSDAY FRIDAY SATURDAY 
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE CREWMEN IN THEIR DAY COULDN'T ACTUALLY COUNT 
THEY WERE ILLITERATE SO THEY COULD IDENTIFY THE MASTS BY THE DAYS OF THE WEEK 
GOOD OLD THURSDAY THERE 
SHE HAD A REFIT IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY TWO AND WAS REDUCED TO FIVE MASTS 
WHEN SHE BECAME A CARGO VESSEL IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO WITH ANOTHER REFIT SHE WAS DROPPED DOWN TO JUST THREE MASTS 
BUT THANKFULLY TODAY SHE'S GOT SIX MASTS BACK ON DECK 
SHE'S RESTORED TO HER FORMER GLORY AND I MUST SAY SHE DOES LOOK ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT 
GOING BACK TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY FIVE HER TRIPS TO AMERICA DID SHE HAVE A SUCCESSFUL SALING HISTORY 
NOT REALLY NO 
ON THE FIFTH JOURNEY OVER TO AMERICA SHE CRASHED INTO DUNDRUM BAY 
WAS THAT HUMAN ERROR 
IT WAS HUMAN ERROR THE CAPTAIN MISSED THE LIGHTHOUSE SIGNALS SO THEY ENDED UP ON THE BEACH 
IT TOOK A YEAR BEFORE THEY BROUGHT HER HOME AGAIN 
SO THAT WAS THE END OF HER AMERICAN RUN 
SHE WAS THEN BOUGHT BY A COMPANY 
TO TAKE EMIGRANTS TO AUSTRALIA AND THAT IS WHAT SHE WAS BEST KNOWN FOR 
WHAT WAS SHE DOING BEFORE NINETEEN SEVENTY WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT BACK HERE 
SHE WAS ACTUALLY A STORE SHIP IN THE FALKLAND ISLANDS IN PORT STANLEY 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN THEY DECIDED SHE WAS TOO OLD TO EVEN HOLD THEIR WOOL ON BECAUSE SHE WAS LEAKING 
ALL THE WOOL WAS GETTING WET 
SO THEY TOOK HER AROUND TO A LITTLE COVE CALLED SPARROW COVE 
AND LET HER SINK IN ABOUT SIX FEET OF WATER AND SHE WAS LEFT FOR DEAD 
SHE'S COMPLETED HER JOURNEY NOW HASN'T SHE 
HOW EXCITING WAS THAT VERY EXCITING 
THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT LINED THE RIVER AVON 
AND THEY'D JUST REPATCHED HER ABOUT HER HULL 
SO SHE CAME UP THE AVON UNDER THE SUSPENSION BRIDGE ON HER OWN BELLY 
A FEW WEEKS LATER SHE CAME BACK INTO THE DRY DOCK ON THE SAME DATE THAT SHE LEFT NINETEENTH JULY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY 
ALTHOUGH THE S. S. GREAT BRITAIN WILL NEVER AGAIN GRACE THE OCEANS JUST TO SEE HER HERE IS SUCH A ROMANTIC 
REMINDER OF THE HALCYON DAYS OF GOOD BRITISH ENGINEERING THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 
IT'S ALSO JUST SUCH A WONDERFUL TESTAMENT TO THE GENIUS OF ISAMBARD KINGDOM BRUNEL 
RIGHT NOW IT'S TIME TO GO STRAIGHT BACK TO OUR VALUATIONS IN BATH 
BETTY WE ALL LOVE BEATRIX POTTER 
YOU'VE BROUGHT ALONG THIS LOVELY COLLECTION 
OF BEATRIX POTTER BESWICK FIGURES 
WHERE DID YOU GET THEM FROM 
I WAS FIRST GIVEN QUITE A FEW OF THEM BY A FRIEND FOR MY CHILDREN 
I DIDN'T REALLY WANT THEM TO HAVE THEM BECAUSE I LIKED THEM 
SO I'VE ADDED TO THE COLLECTION MYSELF AND JUST RECENTLY THEY'VE JUST BEEN PUT IN A CUPBOARD 
SO I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT TIME NOW 
AND YOUR CHILDREN YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T LET THEM ACTUALLY HAVE THEM WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN 
BUT AS THEY'VE GROWN UP HAVE THEY LEARNED TO APPRECIATE THEM MY DAUGHTER WANTED THEM 
BUT YOU KNEW THAT THEY HAVE A VALUE SO IT'S SOMETHING YOU WANTED TO SELL YES 
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM IN TERMS OF VALUE NOT A LOT 
BUT I BELIEVE THEY'RE ROUND ABOUT FORTY MAYBE FORTY PER FIGURE 
WE'VE GOT A REAL VARIETY HERE 
WE'VE GOT JEREMY FISHER HERE WE'VE GOT JEMIMA PUDDLEDUCK 
IT IS A NICE COLLECTION 
BUT SOME OF THEM ARE SLIGHTLY MORE COLLECTIBLE THAN OTHERS 
SO MANY PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN COLLECTING THESE 
BUT THEY DO LOOK OUT FOR LOTS OF DIFFERENT LABELS AND MARKS 
THIS ONE HAS GOT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MARK ON IT 
IF WE TURN IT OVER WE CAN SEE IT'S ACTUALLY GOT A GOLD STAMP ON IT 
THAT SORT OF THING IS RARER AND SOMETHING THAT DEALERS REALLY HONE IN ON COLLECTIBLES YES 
THIS ONE HERE ISN'T ACTUALLY ALTHOUGH IT'S A BEATRIX POTTER 
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A BESWICK FIGURE 
IT'S A ROYAL DOULTON FIGURE 
SO AGAIN THAT WILL INTEREST OTHER PEOPLE 
NEVERTHELESS IN TERMS OF SELLING I THINK IT'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KEEP AS ONE 
I WOULDN'T SELL THEM ALL INDIVIDUALLY I'D PROBABLY PUT THEM IN AS A COLLECTION 
LOOKING AT THE CONDITION BECAUSE CONDITION IS 
SO IMPORTANT TO BESWICK COLLECTORS I CAN SEE THAT A COUPLE OF THEM 
AREN'T IN FANTASTIC ORDER THIS ONE'S HAD HIS EAR NIBBLED 
AND A COUPLE OF THE OTHERS ARE DAMAGED 
THAT WILL SLIGHTLY AFFECT THE VALUE 
BUT THE REST OF THEM ARE IN PRETTY GOOD CONDITION 
SO VALUE WISE I WOULD PROBABLY PUT THE COLLECTION IN AS A WHOLE 
AND LET'S PUT TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED 
LET'S HOPE THE COLLECTORS COME ALONG AND WE MAKE MORE MONEY THAN THAT SOUNDS WONDERFUL 
DOES THAT SOUND GOOD TO YOU YES I HOPE THAT THE BEATRIX POTTER MARKET IS BOOMING THAT DAY 
AND I HOPE THE COLLECTORS ARE THERE AND WE MAKE GOOD MONEY 
WELL JOHN YOU'VE BROUGHT IN SOME SPARKLING PLATES HERE FOR US TO LOOK AT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
YOU'VE GOT A GRADUATED SET OF THREE ANOTHER SLIGHTLY LARGER 
AND ANOTHER SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN THAT HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THESE 
THEY DON'T BELONG TO ME THEY BELONG TO MY SON 
WE WENT ALONG TO A LOCAL AUCTION IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR 
WE SAW THESE GOING AT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A REASONABLE PRICE 
AND SO WE DECIDED TO BUY THEM 
NOW FROM A DISTANCE THESE DISHES COULD BE GEORGIAN COULDN'T THEY 
IN STYLE WITH A GADROON EDGE THE SHAPED GADROON EDGE LIKE THIS 
BUT WHEN WE LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER WE CAN TELL THEY'RE NOT 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE LATE NINETEENTH OR EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY COPIES 
RIGHT AWAY WE'VE GOT NO IF ANY PATINATION HERE 
THERE'S NO HAMMERING MARKS THEY'RE NOT HANDMADE 
SO WE'VE ALSO GOT A HALLMARK HERE WHICH SAYS THAT IT WAS MADE 
OR HALLMARKED AT LEAST IN LONDON IN NINETEEN THIRTEEN 
RIGHT SO EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY RIGHT 
THAT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE OF COURSE TO THE PRICE 
LOOK AT THE MAKER THE MAKER'S MARK IS W. C. 
FOR WILLIAM CUMMINGS HE WAS A SPECIALIST SILVERSMITH 
IN DRESSING TABLE ITEMS WITH LOTS OF CHERUB MOTIVES AND LITTLE DRESSING TABLE BOXES AND THAT SORT OF THING 
SO TO SEE A SET OF DISHES LIKE THAT IS A LITTLE BIT UNUSUAL 
WHY ARE YOU SELLING THEM SO SOON 
AS I SAID THEY DON'T ACTUALLY BELONG TO ME THEY BELONG TO MY SON 
HE'S DECIDED THAT HE'D LIKE TO RELEASE THE MONEY HE INVESTED SO WHAT DID HE PAY 
HE PAID AROUND ABOUT ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED PLUS OBVIOUSLY THE COMMISSION AND VAT 
SO BEARING IN MIND HOW MUCH HE'S PAID HE OBVIOUSLY NEEDS TO NOT MAKE A LOSS BUT JUST GET HIS MONEY BACK 
HOPEFULLY WITH A SMALL PROFIT 
HOPEFULLY WITH A SMALL PROFIT WELL WE'D LIKE TO SEE A LARGE PROFIT REALLY WOULDN'T WE 
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S SOLID SILVER 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WEIGHT OF THE SILVER HERE 
WE'VE PUT THEM ON THE SCALES AND WE'VE GOT SOMETHING AROUND TWO HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED TEN OUNCES TROY RIGHT 
THEY'RE NOT SOLD PURELY ON THE WEIGHT BUT IT REALLY GIVES US A VERY GOOD GUIDE 
ON THE BASIS OF THIS WHICH WOULD MAKE SOMETHING AROUND SEVEN OR EIGHT AN OUNCE RIGHT AT THE MOMENT 
I THINK YOU'RE LOOKING AT GETTING ABOUT ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED HAMMER PRICE 
WHICH IF IT SELLS FOR THAT BY THE TIME THE COMMISSION WAS TAKEN OFF 
BY THE AUCTIONEER HOPEFULLY THAT WILL SEE HIM BREAK EVEN 
RIGHT 
IF THEY MAKE MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED HE MIGHT BE GOING INTO A SMALL BIT OF PROFIT 
SO I'M HAPPY TO RECOMMEND PUTTING THESE INTO AN AUCTION 
WITH A FIRM RESERVE AT ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WITH THE IDEA THAT IF THEY DON'T REACH THAT THEY WON'T SELL 
I HOPE THE AUCTIONEER WILL SAY THEY MIGHT BE WORTH ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THEY COULD BE WORTH THAT 
EXCELLENT BUT YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE A BIT OF A GAMBLE THAT YOU MIGHT JUST BREAK EVEN 
AND TAKE IT AS A LEARNING CURVE THAT NOT ALL ITEMS MAKE YOU A PROFIT RIGHT AWAY 
I'M SURE MY SON WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO DO THAT 
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR COMING ALONG TODAY CHRISTINE AND HELEN 
YOU HAVE BROUGHT ALONG A REAL PIECE OF QUALITY 
IT'S THIS FABULOUS TEA CADDY 
WHICH WAS MADE AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
IT REALLY IS SUPERB QUALITY IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY 
IS THIS A PIECE YOU'VE HAD IN YOUR FAMILY A LONG TIME 
YES IT'S BEEN IN THE DINING ROOM AND IT CAME FROM MY FATHER'S HOUSE MANY YEARS AGO 
SO NOT SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN REALLY ADMIRED 
NOT REALLY NO IT'S JUST BEEN THERE 
PUSHED IN A CORNER YES 
I LOVE IT I WOULDN'T LET IT GO 
FIRST OF ALL WE'VE GOT THIS WONDERFUL OVAL SHAPE 
WE'VE SEEN TEA CADDIES IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES AND I DO LIKE THESE OVAL CADDIES 
THEY REALLY ARE QUITE BEAUTIFUL 
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT IS THIS WONDERFUL MARQUETRY DETAIL 
YOU CAN SEE THE RIBBON WORK GOING RIGHT THE WAY AROUND THE TOP 
AND ALSO THIS LOVELY MARQUETRY INLAY ON THE TOP 
IT'S MADE FROM ASH BUT THIS DETAIL HERE IS PROBABLY SOME SATINWOOD 
AND BOXWOOD A MIXTURE OF BOTH I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
THEN WE'VE GOT THIS LOVELY LOCK AT THE FRONT HERE 
AND THIS BEAUTIFUL PRINCE OF WALES FEATHERWORK ONTO THE FRONT 
AS WE OPEN IT UP THINGS GO DOWNHILL SLIGHTLY 
WE'VE GOT A LID ON THE TOP HERE 
WE'VE GOT THIS IVORY FINIAL ON THE TOP 
AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS 
IT IS VERY DIFFERENT WOOD TO WHAT WE'VE GOT ON THE OUTSIDE 
THE SHAPE OF THIS DOESN'T EVEN FOLLOW THE GRAIN 
SO IT REALLY HAS BEEN VERY CRUDELY DONE JUST MADE TO FIT OVER 
OBVIOUSLY THE FIRST ONE HAS BEEN BROKEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT APART FROM THAT IT'S SUPERB 
WE'VE GOT THE REMNANTS OF THE LINING INSIDE 
WHICH WOULD HAVE KEPT THE TEA FRESH 
WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT IT AS WELL IS THAT YOU HAVE GOT THE ORIGINAL KEY WHICH IS SUPERB 
AT THE TIME WHEN THIS WAS MADE TEA WAS SO PRECIOUS SO RARE 
THAT YOU NEEDED TO KEEP IT UNDER LOCK AND KEY 
IT'S JUST AMAZING THE WAY THAT TEA IS ACCESSIBLE TO US TODAY 
BUT IT REALLY IS A FANTASTIC PIECE 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY SUPERB QUALITY 
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I PERSONALLY WOULD ABSOLUTELY LOVE TO OWN 
SO I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE GETTING RID OF IT I WOULD JUST LOVE IT AND KEEP HOLD OF IT 
WELL IF IT WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION 
AND BY THAT I MEAN IF IT HAD ITS ORIGINAL LID 
YOU'D BE LOOKING AT PROBABLY AROUND SIX HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED 
NOW BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE ORIGINAL LID IT'S GOING TO BE WORTH ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED 
I'D PROBABLY PUT A RESERVE ON IT OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY 
IT IS BEAUTIFUL THERE ARE SO MANY COLLECTORS OF TEA CADDIES AND IT'S IN SUPERB CONDITION 
I CAN'T SEE WHY IT SHOULDN'T MAKE A LOT MORE THAN THAT 
YOU BROUGHT IT TO THE RIGHT PLACE LET'S HOPE WE TAKE IT TO THE RIGHT AUCTION 
AND IT FALLS IN THE RIGHT HANDS AT THE END OF THE DAY 
WILL THERE BE A STORY TO TELL WITH THESE BEATRIX POTTER FIGURES 
OR EVEN A SILVER LINING FOR THESE FIVE PLATTERS 
AND EVERYBODY LOVES THIS EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY TEA CADDY 
ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PIECES OF THE SALE 
I LOVE THIS I COULD GO HOME WITH THIS IF I WAS ALLOWED TO
