WILL IT LEAD TO CURES OR IS IT A 
STEP TOO FAR 
THREE DAYS OF MOURNING CHINA 
UNITES IN GRIEF AS THE NUMBER OF 
DEAD OR MISSING RISES TO MORE THAN 
SEVENTY THOUSAND SEVENTY THOUSAND AND BLOOMING MARVELLOUS THE 
CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW OPENS IN STYLE

THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE GAMES 
GOOD AFTERNOON MORE THAN TWO WEEKS 
AFTER CYCLONE NARGIS STRUCK BURMA 
THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY RULERS HAVE 
AGREED TO AN INTERNATIONAL AID 
EFFORT TO HELP THE VICTIMS BURMA'S 
NEIGHBOURS MEETING AT A SPECIALLY 
CONVENED SUMMIT IN SINGAPORE SAY 
THE REGIME WILL ACCEPT MEDICAL 
TEAMS FROM COUNTRIES SUCH AS 
THAILAND INDONESIA AND THE 
PHILIPPINES THE BURMESE 
AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO ANNOUNCED A 
THREE DAY PERIOD OF MOURNING 
STARTING TOMORROW THE CYCLONE HAS 
KILLED ALMOSTLE EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND 
LEFT TWO MILLION OTHERS DESTITUTE 
FOREIGN VOERPS BEEN BANNED FROM 
BURMA BUT OUR CORRESPONDENT 
MANAGED TO ENTER THE COUNTRY AND 
HAS SPENT THE PAST FEW DAYS IN THE 
RANGOON AREA 
TWENTY MINUTES OUTSIDE RANGOON A 
CHECKPOINT ON THE ROAD FOR A TENSE 
HOUR WE WAITED WE WERE IN BURMA 
ILLEGALLY OUR DRIVER WAS TAKEN WAY 
TO BE QUESTIONED ALL ROUTES OUT 
ARE BEING SEALED OFF TO STOP 
FOREIGNERS GETTING INTO THE 
CYCLONE HIT IRRAWADDY DELTA 
GO BACK BECAUSE THEY TOLD ME BY 
ORDER ORDER AID WORK REMEMBERS BEING KEPT IN 
RANGOON EVEN THOUGH AN ESTIMATED 
TWO POINT FIVE MILLION ARE IN NEED OUTSIDE 
BURMA'S MILITARY RULERS ARE 
CONCERNED ADMITTING THEIR OWN AID 
EFFORTS ARE HOPELESSFULLY INADD 
QUALT COULD LOOSEN THEIR HOLD ON 
POWER POWER DESPITE THE SECURITY CLAMPDOWN WE 
MANAGED TO GET OUT TO ONE VILLAGE 
PEOPLE WERE SITTING BY THEIR RUINED 
HOMES WAITING FOR AID MEMBERS OF 
THE BURMESE RED CROSS HAD JUST 
ARRIVED TWO WEEKS AFTER THE 
CYCLONE HIT UNCENSORED INFORMATION 
IS GETTING TO BURMA'S PEOPLE WE 
BROUGHT THIS D. V. D. ON A RANGOON 
STREET CORNER SHOT BEEN ANONYMOUS 
CITIZENS WITH CAMCORDERS THE 
SCENES OF DEVASTATION AND PEOPLE 
WITH LITTLE AID FUELLING THE 
DISCONTENT ALREADY FELT HERE BUT 
ONLY THE BOLD SPEAK OUT RISKING 
ARREST THIS MAN URGED FOREIGN 
WARSHIPS WAITING OFF THE COAST TO 
BRING IN SUPPLIES REGARDLESS OF THE 
MILITARY GOVERNMENT'S WISHES 
THEY WANT TO HELP ME BUT OUR 
GOVERNMENT CUT OUT THEIR HELP THEY 
MUST COME TO OUR COUNTRY BY 
INTERNATIONAL LAW BY FORCE 
ORDINARY PEOPLE FROM RANGOON ARE 
TRAVELLING TO THE STRICKEN AREAS TO 
DO WHAT THEY CAN TO HELP BUT 
BURMA'S RULERS SEEM MORE CONCERNED 
ABOUT SAVING THEMSELVES THAN THEIR 
PEOPLE PEOPLE ROLAND JOIN US FROM BANGKOK 
OBVIOUSLY THIS NEWS WILL BE 
WELCOMED BY SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE 
YOU MET BUT ONE WONDERS IF IT'S 
GOING TO BE TOO LITTLE TOO LATE FOR 
MANY 
INDEED WHEN WE WERE THERE WE MANY MET AID WORKERS WHO WANT TO GET OUT 
TO THE IRRAWADDY DELTA BUT WERE 
STUCK IN RANGOON PREVENTED BY 
GOVERNMENT FROM GOING TO THE PLACES 
WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED WHAT SEEMS 
TO BE HAPPENING IS THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT IS CONCENTRATING ITS 
EFFORTS ON THE CITY TREES HAVE 
BEEN CLEARED AND THERE ARE MEN UP 
POLES TRYING TO RESTORE ELECTRICITY 
TRYING TO GET THAT CITY BACK TO 
NORMAL THE SCENE OF PROTEST IN THE 
PAST 
LET'S SPEAK TOUR PAST CORRESPONDENT IN SINGAPORE WHERE 
AID FOR BURMA IS NOW BEING 
DISCUSSED DISCUSSED GOOD NEWS IN A SENSE JONATHAN 
PRESUMABLY DIPLOMACY AND THE SCALE 
OF THE DISASTER PERSUADING THE MILL 
ILT AIR RULERS THEY CAN'T DO THIS 
ALONE WHAT HAPPENS NOW MILITARY 
THAT IS THE PROBLEM THERE IS NO 
DETAILS BEING WORKED OUT ABOUT HOW 
THE ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF 
INTERNATIONAL HELP THAT ARE READY 
FOR THE BURMESE PEOPLE WILL BE 
CHANNELLED THROUGH WHAT THEY ARE 
CALLED THIS ASIAN MECHANISM NOERD 
USING ORGANISATIONS AND PERSONNEL 
BASED IN NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES 
WHICH FOR FACE SAVING REASONS THE 
BURMESE MILITARY ARE WILLING TO 
ACCEPT THAT HASN'T BEEN SPELLED 
OUT BUT WE HAVE HAD A CHANGE OF 
ATTITUDE IN THE LAST WEEK THE 
BURMESE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN 
INSISTING IT HAS EVERYTHING UNDER 
CONTROL AND SAYING IT DOESN'T NEED 
FOREIGN AID A THIS MEETING IT 
SUGGESTED THE PRINCIPLE IT DOES 
NEED FOREIGN AID BUT IT'S VERY 
TOUCHY ABOUT THE IDEA OF LETTING 
WESTERNERS HAVE UNCONTROLLED ACCESS 
AND HOW MUCH ACCESS THE KEY AID 
DONORS IS GOING TO BE THE SUBJECT 
OF A LOT OF NEGOTIATION 
THANK YOU 
SHOULD SCIENTIST BE ALLOWED TO MIX 
HUMAN AND ANIMAL EMBRYOS TO TRY AND 
FIND TREATMENT AND CURES FOR OUR 
MOST DEBILITATING DISEASES THAT IS 
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS FACING M. P.'S IN 
A FREE VOTE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS 
SCIENTIST SAY THE RESEARCH COULD 
SAVE MILLIONS OF LIVES BUT CRITICS 
SAY IT TAMPERED WITH NATURE AND IS 
IMMORAL OUR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT 
REPORTS REPORTS IN THIS MACHINE AT KING'S COLLEGE 
LONDON SCIENTISTS INTEND TO GROW 
HUMAN ANIMAL HYBRID EMBRYOS FOR 
AROUND FIVE DAYS BEFORE EXTRACTING 
THE STEM CELLS INSIDE THE LEAD 
SCIENTIST MADE A FINAL APPEAL TO 
M. P.'S M. P.'S DON'T BAN IT TO DO SO WOULD REALLY 
INHIBIT BRITAIN'S ABILITY TO BE THE 
WORLD LEADER IN STEM CELL RESEARCH 
AND WOULD SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE 
THE CELL LINES WILL BE USED BY 
RESEARCH GROUPS THROUGHOUT THE 
WORLD TO GENERATE THERAPIES FOR 
DISEASE THERAPYS WE DON'T HAVE AT 
THE CURRENT TIME 
SEVERAL MEMBERS OF LIZ SHIPLEY'S 
FAMILY HAVE DIED FROM MOTOR NEURONE 
DISEASE DISEASE HER HEALTH IS 
SLOESLY WORSENING SHE WANTS SLOWLY 
WORSEN SHE WANTS HYBRID RESEARCH 
TO CONTINUE 
IT BRINGS FORTH THAT 
ONE DAY THERE WILL BE A TREATMENT 
AND A CURE NOT IN MY LIFETIME BUT 
HOPEFULLY IF MY CHILDREN ARE 
UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO DEVELOP IT 
HOPEFULLY IN THEIR LIFETIME THERE 
WILL BE A CURE 
HYBRID EMBRYO RESEARCH HAS THE 
SUPPORT OF NOBLE PRIZE WINNING 
SCIENTIST LEADING DOCTORS AND 
HUNDREDS OF MEDICAL CHARITIES THAT 
MAY SWAY MANY IN THE COMMONS BUT 
ULTIMATELY IT WILL BE DOWN TO THE 
CONSCIENCE OF INDIVIDUAL M. P.'S TO 
DECIDE WHETHER THE WORK HERE SHOULD 
CONTINUE OR BE BANNED SOME M. P.'S ARE 
DEEPLY SCEPTICAL OF THE CLAIMED 
BENEFITS OF EMBRYONIC STEM CELL 
RESEARCH AND ARGUE THAT HYBRIDS ARE 
MORALLY OBJECTIONABLE 
DESPITE ALL OF THIS HYPE ABOUT THE 
FACT WE ARE GOING TO CURE 
PARKINSON'S AND MOTOR NEURONE 
DISEASE NO ONE DOUBTS THESE ARE 
TERRIBLE DISEASES IF THERE WAS A 
WONDER CURE OF DOING IT NOT A 
SINGLE CURE HAS COME AFTER TWENTY YEARS 
ALL WE HAVE IS SCIENTISTS 
TELLINGING US YOU HAVE TO PUSH OUT 
THE ETHICAL BOUNDARIES MORE AND 
MORE UNTIL THERE ARE NO BOUNDARIES 
THE COMMONS WILL ALSO VOTE ON 
SAVIOUR SIBLINGS THIS ALLOWS 
COUPLES TO HAVE ONE CHILD WHOSE 
UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD CAN TREAT 
ANOTHER M. P.'S MUST RULE WHETHER THIS 
IS MORALLY ACCEPTABLE OR STEP TOO FAR FAR LET'S SPEAK TO OUR CORRESPONDENT AT 
WESTMINSTER THE SIGNIFICANCE OF 
THESE RESULTS CAN'T BE OVERSTATED 
NO THAT'S RIGHT THE VOTES HERE 
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW WILL HAVE FAR 
REEFING CONSEQUENCES FOR FAMILIES 
FOR DOCTOR FAR REACHING 
CONSEQUENCES FOR DOCTORS AND FOR 
SCIENCE AND FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS 
THE STRONG PASSES ON THIS CUT AWE 
CROSS PARTY LINES IT'S WURLTS 
POINT OUT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER 
ONLY ALLOWED A FREE VOTE BECAUSE 
PEOPLE FELT SO STRONGLY AROUND HIS 
OWN CABINET TABLE FELT THEY COULD 
NOT SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT LINE 
THE FIRST VOTE IS GOING TO BE ABOUT 
THE USE OF THE HYBRID EMBRYOS 
ALTHOUGH WE ARE GOING TO SEE A 
INTERESTING DEBATE ON THIS IT 
LOOKS LIKE PARLIAMENT IS POISED TO 
SUPPORT MOVES TO ALLOW THAT TO 
HAPPEN THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL 
PLEASE THE PRIME MINISTER HE 
THINKS THAT IS IMPORTANT IN TERMS 
OF TACKLING CURES FOR THE FUTURE 
LATER THIS EVENING IT LOOKS LIKE 
THE VOTE WILL GO THROUGH TO ALLOW 
THE SAVIOUR SIBLINGS 
TOMORROW'S VOTE THE ROLE OF 
FATHERS IN I. V. F. AND ABORTION LIMITS 
COULD BE MORE CONTENTIOUS THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER THE 
NEED FOR A FATHER SHOULD BE 
EXPLICITLY REQUIRED FOR THOSE 
SEEKING FERTILITY TREATMENT IS 
SOMETHING WHICH IS A FAR MORE 
POLITICAL ISSUE WITH MANY OF THE 
CONSERVATIVE FRONT BENCH SAYING 
THAT THE NEED FOR A FATHER SHOULD 
BE KEPT IN THERE THAT IS GOING TO 
BE QUITE TIGHT THEN WE HAVE THE 
VOTE ABOUT WHETHER TO REDUCE THE 
TIME LIMIT FOR ABORTION THAT IS ON 
KNIFE EDGE BUT THERE CERTAINLY IS 
A GOOD DEAL OF SUPPORT BUILDING TO 
REDUCE THAT TIME LIMIT DOWN TO 
AROUND TWENTY WEEKS WITH DAVID CAMERON 
THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER LIKELY TO 
VOTE FOR THAT 
YOU CAN FIND ALL OF 
THE KEY FACTS ON THE EMBRYOLOGY 
BILL ON OUR WEBSITE 
POLICE INVESTIGATING ALLEGATIONS OF 
CHILD ABUSE AT A FORMER CHILDREN'S 
HOME IN JERZY SAY THAT SOME BONE 
FRAGMENTS FOUND AT THE SITE ARE 
HUMAN DETECTIVES BEGAN 
INVESTIGATING THE CARE HOME HAUT 
DE LA GARENNE FOUR MONTHS AGO 
SINCE THIN ONE HUNDRED SIXTY PEOPLE HAVE CAME 
FORWARD WITH CLAIMS OF SEXUAL AND 
PHYSICAL ABUSE TELL US MORE ABOUT 
WHAT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED THIS THIS POLICE INQUIRY HAS TAKEN TWO STEPS 
FORWARD AND ONE STEP BACK THE 
POLICE HAVE CONFIRMED FIVE 
FRAGMENTS OF BONE FOUND DURING THE 
EXCAVATION OF THE CELLARS BEHIND ME 
ARE CONFIRMED TO BE HUMAN AND THAT 
THEY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN BURNT NO 
EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THAT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN IT'S TO ESTABLISH WHERE 
THE FRAGMENTS OF BONE WOULD HAVE 
COME FROM WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE 
BEING TESTED ON THE MAINLAND D. N. A. 
TESTED AND CARBON DATA TO ESTABLISH 
WHERE THEY HAVE COME FROM AND HOW 
LONG THEY HAVE BEEN HERE STEP BACK 
IS THAT THE POLICE HAVE BEEN 
CRITICISED FOR EXPRESSING THEIR 
DOUBTS ABOUT SOME OF THE EVIDENCE 
THAT HAS BEEN UNEARTHED AS A RESULT 
OF THE INQUIRY WE KNOW THAT THE 
FRAGMENT OF A CHILD'S SKULL THAT 
SPARKED THIS INVESTIGATION SOME 
FOUR MONTHS AGO COULD BE NOTHING 
MAR THAN A PIECE OF WOOD OR EVEN A 
PIECE OF COCONUT 
THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH MUCH FORMER TOWN MAYOR WHO WAS CAUGHT

KEITH MCNIFFE STEPPED DOWN AFTER HE 
CLAIMED OVER NINE THOUSAND IN BENEFITS HE 
OFFICIATED AT SIXTY SEVEN MATCHES DURING TA 
TIME TIME THE DUCHESS OF YORK SARAH FERGUSON 
HAS CRITICISED THE MEDIA FOR 
ACCUSING HER DAUGHTER BEATRICE OF 
BEING OVERWEIGHT THE DUCHESS SAYS 
THE SUPPRESS SHOULD BE MORE 
RESPONSIBLE AND STOP TRYING TO 
OBLITERATE THE CONFIDENCE OF A 
REGULAR HEALTHY GIRL 
CHINA HAS BEGUN THREE DAYS OF 
NATIONAL MOURNING TO REMEMBER THOSE 
WHO DIED IN THE WORST NATURAL 
DISASTER IN DECADES THIS MORNING 
THE NATION PAUSED FOR THREE 
MINUTE'S SILENCE ONE WEEK AFTER THE 
EARTHQUAKE STRUCK OFFICIAL DEATH 
TOLL STANDS AT THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND WITH A 
FURTHER TWO HUNDRED FORTY INJURED WE REPORT FROM 
THE TOWN OF BEICHUAN 
TODAY CHINA MOURNS 
ACROSS THE NATION THEY 
SOUNDED SIRENS FOR THE DEAD 
THEN AT THE MOMENT THE EARTHQUAKE 
STRUCK THREE MINUTES OF SILENCE 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THEY CAME 
TOGETHER TO REMEMBER NOT A 
NATIONAL HERO BUT THE MEN WOMEN 
AND CHILDREN OF CHINA EVEN ONE 
WEEK AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE LIVES 
ARE STILL BEING SAVED FROM THE 
RUINS OF THIS COLLAPSED BUILDING 
RESCUE WORKERS BRING A MAN OUT 
ALIVE THEY LOWER HIM TO THE GROUND 
AND COVER HIS EYES BUT THESE 
MOMENTS ARE INCREASINGLY RARE FOR 
THE SURVIVORS LIFE HAS TO START 
ALL OVER AGAIN MANY OF THEM ARE 
NOW LIVING IN TEMPORARY SHELTERS 
THEY HAVE TO RELY ON THE GOVERNMENT 
FOR EVERYTHING IT'S GOING TO BE 
YEARS BEFORE LIFE GETS BACK TO 
NORMAL IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU COME 
HERE AND SEE FOR YOURSELF THE 
DEVASTATION CAUSED BY THE 
EARTHQUAKE THAT YOU CAN REALLY 
UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT IT'S HAD ON 
THE PEOPLE HERE AND ALSO ON THIS 
COUNTRY 
OUR TOP STORY THIS LUNCHTIME THE 
AUTHORITIES IN BURMA HAVE AGREED TO 
ALLOW AN INTERNATIONAL AID EFFORT 
TO HELP VICTIMS OF CYCLONE NARGIS 
COMING UP HONOURING OUR SERVICEMEN 
AND WOMEN IS A PUBLIC HOLIDAY THE 
WAY TO DO IT 
ON B. B. C. LONDON BACK TO SCHOOL WHY 
ADULTS ARE GETTING A HELPING HAND 
TO RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM CHELSEA 
BUILD UP THEIR EUROPEAN CUP FINAL 
THE CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW NORMALLY 
ASSOCIATED WITH GARDENING 
EXTRAVAGANCE BUT THIS YEAR IT'S 
ALSO TACKLING MORE PRESSING EVERY 
DAY NEEDS SUCH AS PARKING WHEELIE 
BINS AND FINDING SOMEWHERE FOR 
CHILDREN TO PLAY OUR CORRESPONDENT 
DAVID SILLITO IS THERE SOUNDS LIKE 
A PRACTICAL CHELSEA FLOWER SAP SHOW 
WELL THERE ARE THE EXTRAVAGANCE AND 
BEAUTIFUL GARDENS BUT ALSO WELL 
LOOK AT THIS ONE IT'S ATTENDING TO 
EVERY DAY NEEDS YEAH A PLACE FOR 
THE WHEELIE BIN OVER HERE PARKING 
PARKING THAT WON'T CREATE A FLOOD 
RISK OR CONTRAVENE GUIDE GUIDELINES 
THE MESSAGE OF THIS IS BEAUTY AND 
WILDLIFE IN OUR OFTEN NEGLECTED 
FRONT GARDENS 
THE BLOOMS ARE PERFECT THE DESIGNS 
SPECTACULAR THIS IS WHERE THE RICH 
AND FAMOUS COME FOR GARDEN IDEAS 
IT'S INSPIRATIONAL TO COME HERE AND 
SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO IN VERY SMALL 
THIS IS NOT AN ENORMOUS STAND IT IT DOES REFLECT WIDER TRENDS SUCH AS 
THE NEW FASHIONABILITY OF GROWING 
VEGETABLES 
THE SPINACH IS VEGETABLES MAGNIFICENT CARROTS NEVER DO WELL 
WITH 
AND HAVING YOUR OWN CHICKENS WITH THIS IS CHELSEA'S TAKE ON THE 
CHICKEN COOP THIS IS WHERE YOU GET 
THE EGGS FROM 
THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FOR A CHICKEN COOP AFTER 
THE FASHION FOR GREEN ROOMS WE NOW 
HAVE GREEN WALLS BUT THERE ARE 
ALSO OTHER ISSUES SUCH AS ALLOWING 
CHILDREN MORE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY 
OUTSIDE HOWEVER MIXING KIDS AND 
CHELSEA PLANNED PERFECTION ISN'T 
EASY ARE YOU NERVOUS 
A LITTLE BIT 
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE GARDEN 
IS ABOUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S AN 
INCREDIBLY STIMULATING SPACE FOR 
THEM 
AMONG THE BOTANICAL GLAMOUR THEM AND AN ATTAINABLE GARDEN PERFECTION 
SOME SOLUTIONS TO REAL GARDEN 
PROBLEMS EVEN WHERE TO PUT THE 
WHEELIE BIN 
WHILE THIS MEETS NEW PLANNING 
REGULATIONS ABOUT PARKING VEHICLES 
WILL CHELSEA BECAUSE NEXT YEAR THE 
WHOLE EVENT IS TO APPLY FOR 
PLANNING PERMISSION TALKS ARE 
ALREADY WELL UNDER WAY 
NOW THERE ARE FRESH CALLS TODAY FOR 
THE CREATION OF A PUBLIC HOLIDAY TO 
MARK THE ROLE OF THE ARMED FORCES 
IN SOCIETY AND TO BOOST PUBLIC 
RECOGNITION OF THE MILITARY A 
GOVERNMENT COMMISSIONED REPORT ALSO 
RECOMMENDS THE ANNUAL HOLIDAY 
SHOULD CELEBRATE THE CONTRIBUTION 
OF VETERANS OUR CORRESPONDENT PAUL 
ADAMS IS AT THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE 
FOR US WITH MORE 
YES THE GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED 
THAT SOCIETY AS A WHOLE UNDERSTANDS 
LESS AND LESS ABOUT WHAT THE 
MILITARY DOES AND NEEDS TO FIND 
MORE WAYS OF EXPRESSING ITS 
APPRECIATION DESPITE THE 
RESERVATIONS PEOPLE MAY HAVE ABOUT 
THE POLITICS OF THE WARS IN IRAQ 
AND AFGHANISTAN THIS REPORT TALKS 
ABOUT IMPROVING NATIONAL 
RECOGNITION OF THE ARMED FORCES AND 
MAKES MORE THAN FORTY RECOMMENDATIONS 
SOLDIERS OF THE FIRST BATTALION 
ENJOYING A HOMECOMING PARADE THIS 
YEAR A GENEROUS PUBLIC WELCOME 
AFTER GRUELLING SERVICE IN 
AFGHANISTAN THE GOVERNMENT WANTS 
MORE OF THIS AND AGREES THERE IS 
PLENTY SOCIETY CAN DO TO MAKE THE 
ARMED FORCES FEEL BETTER VALUE 
REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY PROVIDES A FOCUS 
FOR SOMBRE REFLECTION BUT TODAY'S 
REPORT CALLS FOR A SEPARATE ARMED 
FORCES AND VETERANS' DAY TO BE HELD 
SOMETIME IN LATE JUNE IT ALSO 
WANTS TO SEE MORE SCHOOLS RUNNING 
CADET FORCES AT THE MOMENT THERE 
ARE ONLY TWO HUNDRED SIXTY UNITS IN THE WHOLE 
COUNTRY ONLY SIXTY OF THESE IN 
COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS THE REPORT'S 
AUTHOR IS CONCERNED THAT SOCIETY 
AND THE MILITARY ARE DRIFTING APART 
THERE IS MUCH LESS FAMILIARITY WITH 
THE ARMED FORCES THAN WAS THE CASE 
A GENERATION OR SO AGO THERE IS 
ALWAYS DANGER WHEN YOU HAVE 
PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES THAT THEY 
BECOME CAST APART FROM SOCIETY 
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WHICH SHOULD 
BE A GOOD THING FOR THE MILITARY OR 
FOR THE REST OF US 
THE REPORT 
WANTS TO SEE A CRACKDOWN ON 
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THOSE IN 
UNIFORM THIS YEAR SAW REPORTS OF 
ABUSE DIRECTED AT R. A. F. PERSONNEL IN 
PETERBOROUGH DISCRIM DISCRIM 
CHRIS CRIM NATION BY SHOPS WOULD 
ALSO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE 
NOW THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT ACCEPTS 
EVERYTHING IN THIS REPORT AND 
INDEED SAYS IT'S IMPLEMENTING SOME 
OF THE FINDINGS ALREADY BUT 
QUENTIN DAVIS ADMITS SOME OF THIS 
IS INTANGIBLE IT'S ABOUT PUBLIC 
CONSCIOUSNESS AND HABITS OF MIND A 
SEPARATE PAPER OUTLINING WHAT THE 
GOVERNMENT CAN DO TO IMPROVE THE 
LIVES OF SERVICE PERSONNEL AND 
VETERANS IS DUE OUT LATER THIS YEAR 
THOUSANDS OF FOREIGN MIGRANTS IN 
SOUTH AFRICA HAVE TAKEN REFUGE IN 
POLICE STATIONS AND CHURCHES AFTER 
ATTACKS ON THEIR COMMUNITIES THE 
POLICE SAY AT LEAST TWENTY PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN KILLED SINCE THE VIOLENCE 
FIRST ERUPTED A WEEK AGO OUR 
CORRESPONDENT IS IN JOHANNESBURG 
NOW A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE ARE SAID 
TO BE FROM ZIMBABWE WHAT'S BEHIND 
THE ATTACKS WHO IS CARRYING THEM 
OUT 
WELL IT'S SOUTH AFRICANS OUT CARRYING THEM OUT FRUSTRATED AT 
UNEMPLOYMENT LACK OF HOUSING AND 
CRIME LEVELS AND THE IMMIGRANTS ARE 
ESSENTIALLY BEING SCAPEGOATED FOR 
THOSE PROBLEMS THERE HAVE BEEN 
ATTACKS ON THEM MOBS IN 
JOHANNESBURG ARMED WITH MACHETES 
STICKS HERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE FLED THAT VIOLENCE I AM IN A 
POLICE STATION IN THE CENTRE OF 
JOHANNESBURG ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE 
SLEPT THE NIGHT HERE AND HAVEN'T 
BEEN FED FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS THERE IS A 
SERIOUS HUMANITARIAN PROBLEM HERE 
AS WELL 
IN TERMS OF THE POLICE 
WHAT ARE THEY DOING DO THEY HAVE 
THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL THERE 
AND ELSEWHERE 
WELL IT'S A GOOD 
QUESTION ONE OF THE POLICE 
OFFICERS I HAVE SPOKEN TO SAID WE 
NEED TO CALL IN THE ARMY THE 
VIOLENCE HAS BEEN SPREADING IT'S 
BEEN BREAKING OUT IN DIFFERENT 
AREAS THERE HAVE BEEN APPEALS FROM 
POLITICIANS FOR CALM BUT SO FAR 
THOSE APPEALS HAVE GONE UNHEADED 
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE WHO 
ARE VERY WORRIED SOME HAVE 
BELONGINGS BUT SOME HAVE FLED HERE 
WITH ABSOLUTELY NOTHING L. HAVE 
SPOKEN TO ZIMMENS WHO WANT TO 
ZIMBABWENS WHO WANT TO RETURN HOME 
BUT DON'T HAVE THE NOUN GO BACK 
HERE DESPITE ALL THE WARNINGS IT 
WOULD SEEM THAT MANY OF US ARE 
STILL NOT TAKING IN BASIC 
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MUCH ALCOHOL 
WE ARE DRINKING AND HOW MUCH IS 
SAFE THREE QUARTERS OF PEOPLE 
QUESTIONED IN A GOVERNMENT SURVEY 
COULDN'T SAY HOW MANY UNITS THERE 
WERE IN A GLASS OF WINE THE 
GOVERNMENT'S LAUNCH AGO NEW CAREFUL 
DRINKING CAMPAIGN TO INCREASE OUR 
AWARENESS OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT 
JANE HUGHES REPORTS 
WHEN YOU GO OUT FOR DRINK DO YOU 
KNOW HOW MUCH ALCOHOL YOU ARE 
HAVING WE HAVE BEEN BOMBARDED WITH 
INFORMATION ABOUT ALCOHOL UNITS FOR 
YEARS BUT IT SEEMS LOT OF US ARE 
STILL NOT GETTING THE MESSAGE HOW 
MANY UNITS ARE IN THAT GLASS OF 
WINE THREE THINK THERE ARE TWO WINE THREE I THINK THERE ARE TWO ONE 
THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES TO ONE BE CONFUSED THREE QUARTERS OF 
THOSE ASKED DIDN'T REALISE THAT A 
LARGE GLASS OF WINE CONTAINED THREE 
UNITS TWO THIRDS DIDN'T REALISE A 
DOUBLE GIN ANTONIC IS TWO UNITS 
AND ONE THIRD DIDN'T KNOW THAT AN 
AVERAGE PINT CONTAINS TWO UNITS AS 
WELL WELL THIS ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN IS 
DESIGNED TO PUSH HOME THE SAFE 
DRINKING MESSAGE 
DID YOU KNOW IF 
WOMEN REGULARLY EXCEED TWO TO THREE 
UNITS A DAY IT COULD ADD UP TO A 
SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEM SOME SOME QUESTION WHAT DIFFERENCE ADS LIKE 
THIS REALLY MAKE 
THE YOUNG PEOPLE 
WE SPOKE TO IN OUR STUDY REPRESENT 
DRINKING AS BEING A IT'S A FUN 
ACTIVITY PARTICULARLY DRINKING TO 
A POINT OF INTOXICATION IT COULD 
BE FUN THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THEY 
WERE TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE UNITS 
THEY WERE DRINKING AND INDEED 
DRINKING TO A POINT MONITORING 
THE DRINKING IN THAT WAY SO IT WENT 
AGAINST THEIR OBJECTIVE WHICH WAS 
TO GET DRUNK 
WHEN WE SHOWED THE 
NEW ADS TO THESE DRINK TERSE DID 
HAVE AN IMPACT DRINKERS IT DID 
HAVE AN IMPACT 
YOU MIGHT AS WELL 
NOT EVEN DRINK 
I DIDN'T KNOW ANY 
OF THESE BEFORE L. THOUGHT A PINT 
WAS TWO A GLASS OF WINE WAS ONE 
BUT IT TURNS OUT SOME ARE EVEN UP 
TO THREE 
I WOULD NEVER KNOW THIS 
EVEN IF IT DOESN'T DO NOTHING AT 
LEAST YOU KNOW 
THE QUESTION IS 
THOUGH HOW LONG WILL THEY REMEMBER 
THE SAFE DRINKING MESSAGE 
IT'S THE FINAL WEEK OF CAMPAIGNING 
FOR THE CREWE AND NANTWICH BY 
ELECTION IT'S BECOME ALITMUS TEST 
FOR GORDON BROWN'S GOVERNMENT AND 
HIS POLICIES ON TAX LABOUR'S ALSO 
COME IN FOR CRITICISM FOR RUNNING A 
NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN THE LATEST POLL 
SUGGEST THE TORIES COULD BE ABOUT 
TO MAKE THEIR FIRST BY ELECTION 
GAIN SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO YOU HAVE BEEN 
GAUGING THE MOOD THERE TODAY 
YES I MEAN WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE 
IN THIS BY ELECTION IS THIS I 
SUPPOSE THE POLITICAL EQUIVALENT OF 
SATS RACIAL BOMB SATURATION 
CAMPAIGNING THERE IS CABINET 
MINISTERS HERE SENIOR LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THIS IS THE MOST 
INTERESTING BY ELECTION THERE HAS 
BEEN IN PROBABLY TWELVE FIFTEEN YEARS 
THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE IF DAVID 
CAMERON WINS WITH A MAJORITY OF ONE 
HE WILL SAY I HAVE THE WIND IN MY 
SAILS WE ARE MOVING FORWARDS 
TOWARDS A GENERAL ELECTION VICTORY 
IF GORDON BROWN WINS FOR THE 
LABOUR PARTY THEN LABOUR WILL BE 
ABLE TO SAY SO MUCH FOR DAVID 
CAMERON HE STILL CAN'T WIN A BY 
ELECTION AND TAKE A LABOUR SEAT 
THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT AT STAKE 
THANK YOU 
THE FIRST TEST BETWEEN ENGLAND AND 
NEW ZEALAND APPEARS TO BE HEADING 
FOR A DRAW ON THE FINAL DAY AT 
LORDS NEW ZEALAND ARE ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN TO THREE IN 
THEIR SECOND INNINGS A LEAD OF SEVENTY ONE 
RUNS RUNS AT A TIME WHEN THE TWENTY OVAL FORMAT 
HAS TAKEN BY STORM THE RAIN HAS 
MADE THIS MATCH RATHER LESS OF A 
SPECTACLE BUT IN THEORY ENGLAND 
CAN STILL PULL OFF A SPECTACULAR 
VICTORY IF THEY GET ENOUGH EARLY 
WICKETS SO 
NOT ENOUGH YET THOUGH TO WARM THE 
HEARTS OF THE FAITHFUL FEW AT LORDS 
RYAN SIDEBOTTOM MADE LIFE 
UNCOMFORTABLE FOR NEW ZEALAND AND

FINGERS JAMIE HOW GIVE THAN 
REPRIEVE WENT ON TO REACH HIS HALF
