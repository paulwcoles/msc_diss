I DON'T LIKE THAT SHED SAID JOSH 
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING NASTY THERE 
DAD KISSED JOSH 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK TOGETHER HE SAID 
IN THE YARD JOSH HID BEHIND THE DOOR WHILE DAD LOOKED INSIDE 
LOOK JOSH SAID DAD 
JOSH PEEPED OUT 
HE SAW SOME VERY DUSTY SHELVES FULL OF OLD TOOLS AND RUSTY TINS 
IT WASN'T DARK ANY MORE 
H. M. M. I THINK I'VE GOT AN IDEA SAID DAD 
THE NEXT DAY WHEN JOSH CAME BACK FROM HIS AUNTY LOU'S 
HE SAW THAT DAD HAD PAINTED THE SHELVES RED AND YELLOW 
AND HE'D PUT JOSH'S FOOTBALL ON THEM AND HIS CARS 
AND THERE WAS ENOUGH ROOM TO KEEP HIS BIKE THERE TOO OUT OF THE RAIN
