IT CERTAINLY LOOKS POPULAR HERE 
I'M NOT HERE TO SIT IN A DECK CHAIR I'VE GOT SOME EXPLORING TO DO

HE'LL DISCOVER HOW IMPORTANT TOURISM IS TO THE PEOPLE 
WHO LIVE HERE ALL YEAR 
SO WHERE IN THE WORLD IS HE 
FROM THE U. K. ANDY FLEW SOUTH EAST FOR THREE HOURS 
TO THE FAR SOUTH OF SPAIN 
HIS DESTINATION THE COSTA DEL SOL 
HE'S STAYING IN THE HOLIDAY RESORT OF TORREMOLINOS 
THE FIRST BRITISH PACKAGE HOLIDAY MAKERS 
ARRIVED IN TORREMOLINOS OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO 
THE CHEAP CHARTER FLIGHTS FROM THE U. K. TO SPAIN IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
ATTRACTED MORE AND MORE VISITORS 
THEY CAME TO SPAIN FOR THE HOT SUNNY WEATHER 
AND THE LONG SANDY BEACHES 
A TOURIST INDUSTRY SPRUNG UP WHICH MADE SURE THEY'D FEEL AT HOME 
TODAY 
OVER EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE VISIT THE COSTA DEL SOL EVERY YEAR 
MOSTLY FROM EUROPE 
THEY STILL COME FOR THE BEACHES 
BUT TORREMOLINOS NOW CATERS FOR EVERY TASTE AND STYLE 
FROM SANDY BEACHES TO BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAINS 
FISH AND CHIPS TO LOCAL SPANISH FOOD 
TOWER BLOCK HOTELS TO SMALLER VILLAS 
YOU MIGHT THINK THAT TORREMOLINOS HAS NOTHING 
BUT HOTELS FOR TOURISTS CAFES FOR TOURISTS 
AND TOURISTY SHOPS BUT TAKE A CLOSER LOOK 
TORREMOLINOS IS A TOURIST RESORT 
BUT IT STILL HAS BASIC SHOPS AND FACILITIES LIKE ANY OTHER TOWN 
WHAT CAN YOU SEE HERE THAT YOU'D FIND WHERE YOU LIVE 
LIKE MOST TOWNS THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF HOUSES 
ANDY'S ENJOYING A SPOT OF PEOPLE WATCHING 
CAN YOU TELL WHICH OF THESE PEOPLE ARE LOCALS AND WHICH ARE TOURISTS 
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE 
HOW DO THE LOCALS FEEL ABOUT ALL THESE TOURISTS ANDY'S ON THE CASE 
I'VE DECIDED TO DRESS MORE LIKE A LOCAL 
TOURISM IS IMPORTANT IT CREATES THOUSANDS OF JOBS FOR LOCALS 
MANY IN HOTELS RESTAURANTS AND BARS LIKE BAR BRISAS 
THIS SMALL PATIO RESTAURANT IS IN LOS ALAMOS 
A RESIDENTIAL AREA ON THE EDGE OF TORREMOLINOS 
THE MANOLO FAMILY HAVE RUN BAR BRISAS FOR MANY YEARS 
AND TOURISTS BRING THEM CUSTOM 
TO FIND OUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WORK HERE 
ANDY'S GOING TO WORK AT BAR BRISAS EVERY NIGHT 
JOSE HOW ARE YOU DOING ARE YOU O. K. HELLO 
ALBA'S EIGHT YEARS OLD 
AND HELPS HER GRANDPARENTS DURING HER HOLIDAYS 
THIS OH GREAT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE PUTTING ME TO WORK ALREADY 
YOU SHOULDN'T LAUGH 
I'M NOT INTO ALL THIS CLEANING BUSINESS 
SEE THERE YOU GO IT'S SPOTLESS I ALWAYS LEAVE A CLEAN JOB 
FOR ME 
PLEASE RUM WITH COLA TO A CLIENT BUT QUICKLY YEAH COME ON 
QUICKLY 
WHERE AM I TAKING IT TO 
THIS FIRST HAVE THE PAPER ON THE TABLE 
ONE JOB DO ANOTHER JOB DO ANOTHER JOB 
YOU COULD EAT YOUR DINNER OFF THAT 
QUE FALTA UN VASO ANDY COME ON I KNOW I'M GOOD LADS 
IT'S HARDER WORK SERVING A TOURIST THAN IT IS BEING ONE I TELL YOU 
BAR BRISAS IS VERY POPULAR WITH BOTH TOURISTS AND LOCALS 
THE TOURISTS TEND TO EAT EARLIER IN THE EVENING 
AND LOCALS COME LATER 
IN SPAIN IT'S NORMAL TO HAVE YOUR EVENING MEAL AT TEN P. M. 
AND CHILDREN OFTEN STAY UP EVEN LATER 
IT'S ONE A M. AND THE LAST CUSTOMERS ARE JUST LEAVING THANK GOODNESS 
I'M SHATTERED 
SO IT'S A LATE FINISH FOR PEOPLE WHO WORK IN RESTAURANTS HERE 
WHILE OTHERS ARE JUST STARTING THEIR WORK OF THE DAY 
ANTONIO IS A LOCAL FISHERMAN 
HE'S FISHED HERE FOR MANY YEARS 
I START WORK BEFORE SUNRISE AND SET OUT FOR MY FIRST CATCH OF THE DAY 
I CATCH DIFFERENT TYPES OF FISH 
SKATE SOLE OCTOPUS AND SQUID 
SOMETIMES IF I GO OUT QUITE A LONG WAY I CAN CATCH SHARK OR TUNA 
I TAKE THE FISH TO THE WHOLESALE PLACE TO SELL 
SOMETIMES I GET A GOOD PRICE AND SOMETIMES NOT BUT THAT'S LIFE 
AS THE SUN RISES 
ANTONIO RETURNS TO HARBOUR TO UNLOAD HIS CATCH READY TO SELL 
WHEN ANTONIO WAS A CHILD TORREMOLINOS WAS A SMALL VILLAGE 
AND FISHING WAS ITS MAIN INDUSTRY 
NOW ITS MAIN INDUSTRY IS TOURISM 
EVEN THOUGH ANTONIO FISHES FOR A LIVING 
HIS JOB RELIES ON TOURISTS TOO 
THE FISH HE CATCHES ARE SOLD TO RESTAURANTS 
LIKE BAR BRISAS FOR TOURISTS TO EAT 
SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THE RESTAURANT 
WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR TWENTY YEARS 
WHAT IS A TYPICAL DAY 
WE OPEN AT NOON 
BUT BEFORE THAT I BUY THE FISH MEAT AND VEGETABLES AT THE MARKET 
WHILE ANNIE ORGANISES THE BAR AND PREPARES THE TAPAS 
TAPAS IS A SMALL SNACK 
IT'S A SPECIALITY OF ANDALUSIA 
YOU CAN HAVE SMALL PORTIONS OF SPANISH OMELETTE 
OR ANDALUSIAN COLD SOUP IT'S GOOD 
WHAT TIME DO YOU CLOSE AT NIGHT 
WE CLOSE AT HALF PAST FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN WE HAVE A BREAK 
THEN OPEN AGAIN AT NINE 
IS IT MAINLY TOURISTS OR LOCALS THAT COME 
WE GET A LOT OF NATIONALITIES 
LIKE SPANISH ENGLISH AND DUTCH 
THERE'S LOTS OF TOURISM 
IT'S REALLY GOOD FOR US IT BRINGS IN MONEY 
THE TOURISTS SPEND THEIR MONEY IN BARS HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS 
TOURISM IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR TORREMOLINOS 
WITHOUT TOURISM IT'D BE A DISASTER 
BUT TOURISM BRINGS PROBLEMS TOO 
LOTS OF BUILDING WORK 
LOTS OF RUBBISH AND LOTS OF TRAFFIC AND NOISE 
AS A RESULT OF THE TOURISM 
TORREMOLINOS IS GROWING AND GROWING 
SPREADING INTO THE SURROUNDING COUNTRYSIDE 
AND THE TOURISTS ARE ALSO KEEPING ANDY BUSY AT BAR BRISAS 
THIS TABLE THE MAN IN THE RED 
UN PLATO DE ROSADA CON PATATA 
YOU COME FOR A HOLIDAY AND YOU WORK 
ENJOY I SHALL DO THANK YOU 
JOSE VERY SLAPDASH I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT LIKE THAT 
HE'S GETTING THE HANG OF THINGS 
AT LAST A CHANCE TO ENJOY THIS HOT SUNNY WEATHER 
HOW HOT IS IT 
THE TEMPERATURE'S A SCORCHING THIRTY FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS 
TYPICAL FOR TORREMOLINOS IN AUGUST 
THE WEATHER'S VERY DRY TOO 
IT HARDLY EVER RAINS BETWEEN MAY AND OCTOBER 
BUT COME THE WINTER 
THINGS COOL OFF 
THE TEMPERATURE FALLS TO AROUND FIFTEEN DEGREES CELSIUS 
STILL MILDER THAN A U. K. WINTER 
THIS IS BECAUSE TORREMOLINOS IS SURROUNDED BY MOUNTAINS 
WHICH PROTECT IT FROM COLD WINDS 
THOUGH QUITE A FEW TOURISTS STILL VISIT THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE RESORT 
IS QUIETER AND CALMER 
BUT THE WINTER BRINGS A LOT MORE 
RAIN 
THOUGH SOME HOTELS BARS AND CAFES STAY OPEN DURING THE WINTER SEASON 
MANY CLOSE INCLUDING BAR BRISAS 
IT GIVES MANOLO A CHANCE TO CATCH UP ON HIS REPAIRS 
WHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD HAS WEATHER LIKE THIS 
TORREMOLINOS LIES ON THE SOUTH COAST OF SPAIN 
WHICH BORDERS THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA 
ITS WEATHER OF HOT DRY SUMMERS AND MILD WET WINTERS 
IS SHARED BY COUNTRIES AROUND THE MEDITERRANEAN 
THE SOUTH OF FRANCE ITALY GREECE AND TURKEY FOR EXAMPLE 
OTHER PLACES FAR FROM EUROPE ALSO SHARE MEDITTERRANEAN TYPE WEATHER 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
SOUTHERN AUSTRALIA 
AND SOUTH WEST AFRICA 
TOURISTS LOVE THE COSTA DEL SOL BECAUSE OF THE HOT WEATHER 
AND SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN THE SUN BUT THEY'RE ONLY HERE A FEW WEEKS 
THEY CAN EASILY COOL OFF IN THE SEA OR POOLS 
FOR PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE THE SUNSHINE ISN'T ALWAYS WELCOME 
ALBA LIVES IN A MODERN APARTMENT IN TORREMOLINOS 
WITH HER PARENTS JOSE AND NIEVES 
AT HOME THE HOT WEATHER DOESN'T AFFECT ALBA AND ROCIO 
THEY LOOK QUITE COMFORTABLE 
IF IT GETS THAT HOT HOW DO YOU KEEP THE HOUSE COOL 
WELL USING THE AIR CONDITION 
THE BLINDS WE HAVE GOT IN MY DAUGHTER'S ROOM 
AND THE APARTMENTS HAVE A POOL A FUN WAY TO KEEP COOL 
DOES IT EVER GET COLD DO YOU NEED HEATING 
YES 
WE'VE GOT HEATING BUT IT'S NOT VERY USEFUL HERE 
WE DON'T ACTUALLY USE IT THIS LAST YEAR 
MAYBE ONE OR THREE TIMES 
YOU USED THE HEATING THREE TIMES YES THE WHOLE WINTER 
IN THE U. K. WE USE IT MORE THAN THAT 
YOU'RE VERY LUCKY IS WHAT I'M SAYING YES WE KNOW WE DO KNOW 
SO WHAT ELSE DO ALBA AND ROCIO GET UP TO IN THEIR HOLIDAYS 
THIS IS THE PALACIO SAN MIGUEL SPORTS CENTRE 
DURING THE HOLIDAYS THEY RUN SPORTS COURSES FOR CHILDREN FROM THE AREA 
ALBA LOVES IT 
WELL IT SEEMS TORREMOLINOS IS A GREAT PLACE FOR A SUMMER HOLIDAY 
FOR BOTH TOURISTS AND THE CHILDREN WHO LIVE HERE 
WHILE EVERYONE ELSE IS AT PLAY SOMEONE HAS TO DO THE DIRTY WORK 
OH WELL I BETTER GET DOWN TO IT IF I'M TO BE FINISHED BY DAYBREAK 
WORK WORK WORK 
YOU COULD EAT YOUR DINNER OFF THAT 
WHERE AM I TAKING IT TO
