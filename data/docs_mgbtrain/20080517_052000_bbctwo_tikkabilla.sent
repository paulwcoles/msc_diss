I'VE HAD A TICKLE TASTICALLY TERRIBLE TIME 
OH LET ME TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT 
EARLY THIS MORNING AS I LAY IN MY BED 
SOMETHING SNEAKED ON TO THE PILLOW BY MY HEAD 
SOMETHING SNEAKED UP WHEN MY EYES WERE CLOSED 
A TICKLE CREPT UP AND ROSE UP MY NOSE 
I WRIGGLED 
AND RUFFLED 
BUT THE TICKLE IT PLAYED

AND RUFFLED 
BUT THE TICKLE IT PLAYED 
WELL I SNIFFLED
