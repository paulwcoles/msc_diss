VLAD THE IDEA IS I MAKE A MOVE YOU MAKE A MOVE 
NOT I MAKE A MOVE WAIT HALF AN HOUR AND THEN DROP DEAD OF BOREDOM 
IF YOU DO 
DO I WIN 
JUST MAKE A MOVE 
O. K. MY HORSE TAKES YOUR KING 
HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT OUT 
MY HORSE CANTERS UP TO YOUR PAWN GALLOPS ROUND YOUR BISHOP 
JUMPS OVER YOUR QUEEN AND LANDS ON YOUR KING SQUISHING HIM TO A PULP 
YES YOU KNOW ONE DAY THEY MIGHT INVENT A COMPUTER THAT CAN BEAT ME 
GREAT THEN WE CAN HANG OUT WITH IT INSTEAD OF YOU HA HA 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE HERE YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE CHESS 
I LIKE CHESS AND YOU KNOW WHY 
IT'S GOT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH VAMPIRES NO BATS NO BLOOD 
ALL RIGHT LISTEN UP NO SLAYERS 
MISS CLELLAND'S HAD AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT ON THE WAY HERE 
SO YOU'LL BE DELIGHTED TO HEAR I'M TAKING THE CHESS CLUB THIS EVENING 
VERY FUNNY NOW SETTLE DOWN 
AND I SUGGEST YOU CONCENTRATE 
BUT THAT'S CHECKMATE 
ONLY THEN WILL YOU BECOME A GRAND CHESS MASTER LIKE THE GREAT CHANDU 
CHAN WHO CHAN DU 
CHANDU WAS A HUNGARIAN COUNT FROM THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
AND REMAINS THE GREATEST CHESS PLAYER WHO EVER LIVED 
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF HIM 
THAT'S HARDLY SURPRISING 
BUT I'M SURE YOUR FATHER WILL KNOW WHO HE IS 
WHICH REMINDS ME THIS IS FROM THE HEADMISTRESS 
OH PLEASE NOT PARENTS' EVENING 
IT'S A REMINDER THAT PARENTS MUST ATTEND 
IF DAD SEES THIS IT'LL BE A DISASTER 
I'VE GOT TO GET RID OF IT 
BUT MASTER VLAD WON'T YOU GET IN TERRIBLE TROUBLE 
IT'S FROM YOUR HEADMISTRESS I KNOW 
AND IT'D BE GREAT FOR DAD TAKE AN INTEREST IN MY SCHOOL WORK 
BUT NO THERE'S JUST NO WAY 
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS 
THERE NOW THAT WILL BE THE END OF IT 
PARENTS' EVENING 
WHAT A MARVELLOUS IDEA 
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT LETTER 
INGRID GAVE IT TO ME I HAVE TO SAY PARENTS' EVENING SOUNDS GREAT FUN 
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS 
PARENTS FEASTING ON THE BLOOD OF THEIR LEAST FAVOURITE OFFSPRING 
NOT QUITE IT'S WHERE YOU COME AND TALK TO OUR TEACHERS 
ABOUT HOW WE'RE DOING AT SCHOOL UH 
SOUNDS GHASTLY IN THAT CASE I'M NOT GOING 
OH REALLY VLADIMIR TELL THEM YOU'RE NOT LOSING TO A STUFFED DOG 
HE'S A WOLF EITHER WAY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PRACTISE 
IF YOU WANT TO BE AS GOOD AS ME 
THE GREATEST CHESS PLAYER TO STALK THE EARTH 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE GREAT CHANDU 
WHAT DID YOU SAY 
THE GREAT CHANDU 
MR. VAN HELSING SAID HE WAS THE BEST CHESS PLAYER IN THE WORLD 
WHAT DID I SAY 
I AM THE GREATEST CHESS PLAYER EVER 
AND I CAN PROVE IT 
O. K. AS NICE AS IT IS TO BE INVOLVED IN FAMILY BUSINESS FOR ONCE 
I WAS PAINTING MY NAILS 
BE QUIET INGRID THIS IS IMPORTANT 
WHAT I AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU 
IS THE STORY OF HOW YOU AND YOUR BROTHER CAME TO BE 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL US ABOUT THE BIRDS AND THE BEES ARE YOU 
NOW LISTEN 
THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
CHANDU AND I WERE IN LOVE WITH THE SAME GIRL 
YOUR MOTHER MAGDA 
SO TO DECIDE WHO SHOULD WIN HER AFFECTIONS WE PLAYED CHESS 
ROMANTIC 
FOR CENTURIES CHESS HAS SETTLED ALL MANNER OF GENTLEMANLY DISPUTES 
AND DESTINY DECIDED THAT SHE AND I SHOULD BE TOGETHER FOREVER 
UNTIL SHE RAN OFF WITH A WEREWOLF 
WHILE CHANDU SUFFERED THE FATE OF ALL LOSERS 
DEATH BY MUMMIFICATION 
SO YOU SEE HERE LIES PROOF THAT I AM INDEED THE BEST CHESS PLAYER EVER 
IS THAT IT YOU DRAGGED US DOWN HERE 
JUST TO TELL US THAT YOU BEAT SOME STINKING MUMMY AT CHESS 
NEXT TIME MR. VAN HELSING TELLS ME SOMETHING I'LL KEEP IT TO MYSELF 
VLADIMIR NO ONE SLURS THE NAME OF A DRACULA 
NOW GO 
LEAVE ME WITH MY MEMORIES 
I WANT TO BE ALONE 
JUST DUSTING YOUR BLOOD COLLECTION MASTER 
CURSE THAT TEACHER SAYING CHANDU WAS BETTER THAN ME 
SURELY YOU WON'T LET HIM GET AWAY WITH IT MASTER 
RENFIELD I THINK THE TIME HAS FINALLY COME 
TO VENTURE INTO THE WORLD OF BREATHERS 
ER VLADIMIR 
YOU'D RATHER CUT OFF YOUR ARMS AND FEED THEM TO A GIANT DUNG BEAST 
THEY WERE INGRID'S ARMS ACTUALLY 
BUT THE POINT IS LOOK ALL THIS TALK OF YOUR MOTHER 
IT'S MADE ME REALISE YOU DESERVE ONE PARENT THERE AT LEAST 
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT NO NO 
IT'S NO PROBLEM I REALLY DON'T MIND 
I'M COMING 
YOU CAN'T IT'S NOT SAFE FOR YOU TO GO OUT IN DAYLIGHT 
WELL IT'LL BE A CHALLENGE 
A CHALLENGE YOU'LL MELT 
AND WHAT IF YOU BITE SOMEONE 
THE PLACE WILL BE FULL OF BREATHERS 
YES I KNOW DAD 
OH REALLY VLADIMIR YOU SHOULD HAVE MORE FAITH IN ME 
I'M GOING TO PARENTS' EVENING TOMORROW AND THAT IS FINAL 
NOW WHAT DO I DO 
IF DAD BITES SOMEONE AT SCHOOL 
WE'LL BE ON THE FIRST SHIP BACK TO TRANSYLVANIA 
BAGSIE A CABIN BY THE WINDOW 
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GAVE DAD THE LETTER 
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA HOW DANGEROUS THAT IS 
WHAT IF HE RUNS INTO MR. VAN HELSING 
THAT LOSER HE'S NO MATCH FOR DAD 
YOU'RE JUST WORRIED HE'LL HEAR WHAT A GOODY TWO FANGS YOU ARE 
WHEREAS WHEN HE HEARS HOW WICKED AND EVIL I AM 
HE'LL HAVE TO BE PROUD OF ME 
I CAN'T WAIT TO LEAVE THE CASTLE IT'LL DO ME GOOD TO STRETCH MY WINGS 
DAD YOU CAN'T TURN INTO A BAT AT SCHOOL 
TOO SHOWY 
TOO VLAD'S DAD'S A VAMPIRE BREATHER LOVER'S GOT A POINT 
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T WEAR THE CAPE EITHER 
AH NOT EVEN IF I WEAR THIS WITH IT ESPECIALLY NOT IF YOU WEAR THAT 
RIGHT YOU KNOW REALLY YOU TWO RELAX 
WHAT'S THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN 
PARENTS' EVENING DON'T 
THE WORDS PARENTS' EVENING SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE YELLING INSIDE MY HEAD 
YOUR DAD IS COMING TO PARENTS' EVENING 
WHAT IF VAN HELSING FINDS OUT HE'LL DENOUNCE HIM IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY 
THAT'S IF HE DOESN'T RAM A BIG STAKE THROUGH YOUR DAD'S SHUSH 
YES I KNOW I TRIED TALKING HIM OUT OF IT BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S LIKE 
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO 
LOOK DON'T PANIC 
ROBIN AND I WILL MAKE SURE 
THAT VAN HELSING KEEPS WELL AWAY FROM YOUR DAD 
YES 
ARGHHH 
JONATHAN YOU KNOW I CAN'T STAND SKELETONS THEY GIVE ME THE CREEPS 
SORRY BUT HE CAN'T EXACTLY WALK TO THE BIOLOGY DISPLAY 
WELL GET RID OF IT WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO 
COUNT DRACULA IS COMING TO PARENTS' EVENING AND DO YOU KNOW WHY 
HE'S A PARENT NO BECAUSE OF MY CAREFUL RESEARCH 
I KNEW I'D LURE HIM OUT OF THE CASTLE SOONER OR LATER 
JONNO PREPARE YOURSELF FOR A SHOWDOWN 
THEY'LL NEVER GUESS YOU'RE A VAMPIRE WEARING THIS MASTER 
AND IT'S A HUNDRED PERCENT SUN PROOF 
YOU'VE DONE WELL RENFIELD 
NOW FOR THE FINAL TOUCH 
SUNGLASSES 
THE OTHER ONES 
PERFECT THAT VAN HELSING WON'T KNOW WHAT BIT HIM 
NOW ROBIN IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR TEACHERS SAY TONIGHT
