THIS IS A JOURNEY TO REVEAL THE ARCHITECTURE OF OUR DREAMS 
SANTO DOMINGO IN THE CARIBBEAN 
IN THE YEMENI DESERT 
MAKING MUD INTO A CITY OF TOWERS 
BHUTAN THE HIDDEN KINGDOM IN THE HIMALAYAS 
WHERE TIME ALMOST STANDS STILL 
AND IN AMERICA DREAMS OF REDEMPTION THAT TURN TO NIGHTMARE 
THIS IS THE YEMENI DESERT 
ON THE SOUTHERN TIP OF THE ARABIAN PENINSULAR 
A PLACE ROOTED IN THE PAST 
BUT WHICH DREAMT OF THE FUTURE 
THIS MYTHIC AND ANCIENT LAND WAS HOME TO BUILDINGS CREATED WAY AHEAD OF THEIR TIME 
STRIKING VISIONARY ARCHITECTURE 
HERE THEY REACHED FOR THE SKY 
THESE WERE THE FIRST SKY SCRAPERS 
THIS IS SHIBAM KNOWN AS THE MANHATTAN OF THE DESERT 
THERE'S BEEN A CITY HERE FOR TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS 
CONSTRUCTED ON A RAISED PLATEAU SHIBAM SITS WITHIN A FERTILE OASIS 
BEYOND THERE'S ONLY DESERT AND MOUNTAINS 
THE CITY HASN'T CHANGED MUCH SINCE THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
EVERY TIME ONE OF THESE TOWERING HOUSES BECOMES DERELICT IT'S REBUILT IN TRADITIONAL MANNER 
THERE ARE AROUND FIVE HUNDRED OF THESE HOUSES WITHIN THE CITY WALL 
THIS IS THE ONLY GATE INTO THE CITY 
IT'S VERY WELL FORTIFIED 
THE TALL CENTRAL ARCH WAS FOR CAMELS AND I SUPPOSE CARAVANS 
AND THE SMALL ONE FOR DONKEYS AND HUMANS PEDESTRIANS 
SHIBAM APPEARS TIMELESS ALMOST BIBLICAL 
AND THE CITY RISES HIGH WITH ANCIENT STRUCTURES BECAUSE OF ITS PECULIAR LOCATION 
WHEN MORE HOMES WERE NEEDED SHIBAM COULDN'T EXPAND HORIZONTALLY 
BUILDING OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS AND OFF THE RAISED PLATEAU WOULD HAVE MADE THE NEW BUILDINGS VULNERABLE 
TO ATTACK TO FLOODS AND ALSO WOULD HAVE USED UP VALUABLE FERTILE LAND 
SO WHEN ALL THE BUILDING PLOTS IN THE TOWN HAD BEEN BUILT UPON THE ONLY WAY TO GO WAS UPWARDS 
EACH TOWER IS LIVED IN BY ONE FAMILY 
BUT UNLIKE THE MODERN HIGH RISE THESE TOWERS ARE NOT MADE 
OF CONCRETE AND STEEL BUT ARE BUILT WITH A MORE MODEST MATERIAL 
MUD 
BRICKS ARE MADE ON THE EDGE OF TOWN JUST NEXT TO PALM GROVES AND THIS IS A BRICKWORKS 
IT'S AN AMAZING TIMELESS SCENE 
BRICKS HAVE BEEN MADE LIKE THIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST FOR WELL TEN THOUSAND YEARS AT LEAST 
HERE WE HAVE RICH ALLUVIAL SOIL DUG FROM AROUND THE PALMS 
BEING MIXED WITH HAY AND WHEAT CHAFF AND WITH WATER TO MAKE THIS 
WONDERFUL MUD 
THE ONLY THING THAT'S CHANGED AROUND HERE IS THE FACT THAT THERE'S A PETROL PUMP OVER THERE GETTING 
WATER FROM A WELL UP UNTIL RECENTLY THAT WAS BEING DONE USING A DONKEY 
WELL HOW 
LONG 
DOES IT TAKE FOR BRICKS TO DRY IN THE SUN 
THREE DAYS THREE DAYS THREE DAYS 
HOW MANY BRICKS CAN YOUR TEAM MAKE IN ONE DAY 
THREE THOUSAND THREE THOUSAND 
THAT'S AN AWFUL LOT CAN I TRY MAKING ONE 
YEAH ME THIS IS ONE OF THOSE GREAT EXPERIENCES 
I'M DOING SOMETHING THAT MAN HAS DONE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
INCREDIBLY MOVING THIS IS WHAT MY ANCESTORS HAVE DONE 
OH IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT ACTUALLY TO FILL IT PROPERLY 
THERE'S A SKILL THERE'S DEFINITELY A SKILL 
AND OF COURSE INCREDIBLY SATISFYING 
GETTING ONE'S HANDS DIRTY MAKING SORT OF MUD PIES 
OH DEAR I'M GOING TO RUIN THE TEAM'S REPUTATION 
NOT A NATURAL BORN BRICK MAKER WELL I KNEW THAT ANYWAY 
UM HOW HAVE I DONE 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL THE TRUTH JUST LIE SAY THEY'RE GREAT 
O. K. I'LL DO BETTER NEXT TIME 
OH WELL HE'S LEAVING THEM O. K. 
I'VE DONE IT 
THEY'RE NOT REJECTED HOW AMAZING 
AFTER THREE DAYS IN THE SUN THE MUD BRICKS ARE DRY AND READY TO BE USED IN THE CITY 
AND HERE'S ONE OF THE BRICKS TILE LIKE 
LOVELY THING DRIED IN THE SUN 
I SHALL GIVE IT TO THE MASTER BRICKLAYER HERE 
RAINFALL IS A GREAT ENEMY OF THESE BUILDINGS 
SO THE VULNERABLE BRICKS ARE COVERED WITH AN EXTRA LAYER OF MUD 
AND OCCASIONALLY PAINTED WITH LIME WASH TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE RAIN 
THIS FINISH COMBINED WITH SIMPLE CUBE LIKE FORMS GIVES THE HOUSES A MARVELLOUS AND MINIMAL LOOK 
THE ELEVATION TO THE INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS ARE VERY SIMILAR 
GIVING ARCHITECTURAL COHERENCE A UNIFORMITY TO THE WHOLE CITY 
IT'S A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE IN FRONT OF ME 
IT'S VERY ROBUST VERY FUNCTIONAL UTILITARIAN 
IN TIMES OF WAR OR SIEGE THESE BUILDINGS FUNCTIONED AS FORTRESSES 
THAT'S WHY THE DOOR IS SO SMALL 
ALSO WHY THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO WINDOWS ON THE GROUND FLOOR JUST THESE LITTLE SLITS 
BEHIND THESE BLANK WALLS WERE STORAGE ROOMS SO THE FAMILY INSIDE COULD KEEP ITSELF FED FOR MONTHS 
I'VE BEEN INVITED TO VISIT A TYPICAL SHIBAM HOUSE 
I'M INTRIGUED TO SEE HOW A MODERN MUSLIM FAMILY LIVES IN ONE OF THESE ANCIENT BUILDINGS 
YES HERE WE GO STOREROOMS ON THE GROUND FLOOR HERE'S THE DOOR 
SO IN THE PAST GET TOOLS ANIMALS CORN DATES ANOTHER STOREROOM HERE 
SO WE'RE GOING FROM THE GROUND FLOOR UP TO FIRST FLOOR 
SOME LIGHT COMING THROUGH LOVELY LATTICE WINDOWS AND UM 
HERE A RECESS FOR A CANDLE TO LIGHT THE STAIRS 
IN FRONT OF ME ON THE FIRST FLOOR STILL MORE STOREROOMS 
UM STOREROOMS BEGIN TO MIX NOW WITH 
AH INHABITED ROOMS AND THIS IS A STOREROOM CERTAINLY BECAUSE THINGS ARE STILL STORED IN HERE 
THE STAIRCASE WRAPS AROUND THIS HUGE BRICK BUILT PIER COLUMN 
AND THIS IS A MAIN INTERNAL STRUCTURE 
HERE ARE THE LOAD BEARING EXTERNAL WALLS 
HERE IS A PIER BETWEEN THE TWO RUN THE BEAMS AND JOISTS 
YOU CAN SEE THEM UP THERE 
AND AH NOW I'VE REACHED THE FAMILY PART OF THE HOUSE 
I'M ON THE SECOND FLOOR 
IT'S WHERE THE FAMILY RESIDES AND SO I TAKE OFF MY SHOES 
AND I'LL GO INSIDE AND 
MEET MY HOST 
AH AS SALAMU ALAYKUM AS SALAMU ALAYKUM SHUKRAN 
AH WEAPONS 
OH WHAT A WONDERFUL ROOM 
WONDERFUL PLASTERWORK 
AH SHUKRAN HELLO SALAAM SALAAM 
UM GOLLY NOW UM 
HOW IS THIS ROOM USED HOW WAS IT USED AND HOW IS IT USED TODAY 
WHAT'S IT LIKE TO MAINTAIN A HOUSE BUILT OF MUD BRICKS 
IS IT VERY DIFFICULT VERY EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN 
CAN I PLEASE SEE MORE OF THE HOUSE 
O. K. SHUKRAN 
O. K. 
IT'S QUITE AN OPEN PLAN INTERIOR VERY MODERN WITH 
THE VERY STRUCTURED AND BEAMS AND JOISTS BEING CARRIED ON THESE COLUMNS 
IT'S LIKE A SORT OF TWENTIETH CENTURY FRAME STRUCTURE 
AND WHAT'S INCREDIBLE IS YOU HAVE THESE WINDOWS 
ORIGINALLY THESE WOULD HAVE BEEN OPEN IT'S GOT GLASS PUT IN NOW BUT THIS IS FOR VENTILATION 
COOL AIR COMES IN AT THE LOW LEVEL THROUGH THE WINDOWS AND PUSHES THE HOT AIR OUT THROUGH THESE OPENINGS 
ALL THE HOUSES HAVE THIS VERY NICE SORT OF SENSIBLE NATURAL FORM OF VENTILATION VERY BRILLIANT 
FASCINATING 
SO THE COOKING TAKES PLACE HERE 
YOU OH I SAY 
SO WHAT'S BEHIND THAT PARTITION OVER THERE WHAT'S BEHIND IT 
OH GOSH LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
OH THERE WE GO AH YES IT'S A SHOWER AND ALSO A LAVATORY BECAUSE THERE'S A LITTLE PLACE TO 
STAND ON THE FLOOR AND I SUPPOSE THERE'S A CHUTE SO 
STRAIGHT DOWN INTO I SUPPOSE SOME SORT OF CESSPIT 
GOSH A SHOWER AND A LOO IN THE KITCHEN 
OH A LOT OF PEOPLE 
HELLO 
OH LOVELY HOW VERY COMFORTABLE ON THIS LOVELY TERRACE 
SHUKRAN OH THIS IS WONDERFUL MARVELLOUS 
WHAT A WONDERFUL VIEW OF NATURE OVER THERE 
AHA SHUKRAN 
LOVELY CHAI M. M. M. 
DELICIOUS PUNGENT SWEET VERY RESTORATIVE 
WHAT A CHAP NEEDS IN THE EVENING 
SHIBAM'S A MARVELLOUS HISTORIC CITY BUT IT'S NO ARID MUSEUM PIECE 
IT'S FULL OF VITALITY AUTHENTICITY WONDERFUL SENSE OF LIFE 
HERE WE ARE ON THE TERRACE GATHERED TOGETHER IN THE EVENING DRINKING TEA 
AND THERE'S WONDERFUL SORT OF AROMAS 
FRANKINCENSE MYRRH AND OF COURSE THE SHEEP AND GOATS AND TERRIFIC NOISES SOUNDS MUSIC 
THIS REALLY IS A LIVING DREAM 
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT HERE 
AMONG THE ISLANDS OF THE CARIBBEAN LIES THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 
IT MAY LOOK LIKE A SLEEPY TROPICAL PARADISE BUT FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
THIS SMALL ISLAND WOULD BECOME ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL PLACES ON EARTH 
I'M ON MY WAY TO SEE THE FIRST EUROPEAN FOUNDED CITY IN THE NEW WORLD 
TO SEE HOW DREAMS OF EMPIRE TRANSFORMED AN ENTIRE CONTINENT 
IT'S A CITY ON WHICH IMPERIAL DREAMS IMPERIAL ASPIRATIONS ARE ETCHED IN THE VERY FABRIC 
IT'S A CITY THAT CHANGED THE WORLD 
THE STORY BEGINS WITH CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS'S VOYAGE TO THE AMERICAS IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO 
HE SET OFF IN SEARCH OF A NEW ROUTE TO THE EAST BUT HE AND HIS CREW LANDED INSTEAD ON THIS ISLAND 
IT WAS NO EASY TASK PUTTING DOWN ROOTS IN AN ALIEN AND DANGEROUS LAND 
IN FACT IN THE EARLY YEARS THE COLONISTS SUFFERED TERRIBLY 
THE FIRST SETTLEMENT JUST DOWN THE COAST FROM HERE WAS DESTROYED PROBABLY BY THE ISLANDERS 
NO ONE'S QUITE SURE BUT WHEN COLUMBUS RETURNED THE PEOPLE 
HE'D LEFT BEHIND THE PEOPLE HAD GONE DISAPPEARED 
THEY WERE NEVER HEARD OF AGAIN 
A SECOND WAVE OF COLONISTS CLUNG ON IN A TEMPORARY SETTLEMENT RAVAGED BY MALARIA AND YELLOW FEVER 
BUT THEY NURSED GREATER AMBITIONS' 
COLUMBUS'S MEN HADN'T FOUND A ROUTE TO THE EAST BUT THEY HAD FOUND 
A NEW LAND AND THEY WERE DETERMINED TO MAKE IT THEIRS 
THEY WANTED TO MAKE THEIR MARK ON THE LANDSCAPE TO BUILD 
A GREAT CITY TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THEY WERE HERE TO STAY THEIR PRESENCE WAS PERMANENT 
WHAT THEY CREATED WAS SANTO DOMINGO 
FOUNDED IN ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ONE THE CITY'S NOW A BUSTLING METROPOLIS OF OVER TWO MILLION PEOPLE 
BUT EXTRAORDINARY TRACES OF THE ORIGINAL CITY REMAIN 
THIS IS SENSATIONAL 
IT REALLY IS A FORGOTTEN HIDDEN GEM 
THIS HOUSE MUST DATE FROM THE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FORTIES 
WHAT A FANTASTIC DOOR SURROUND STONE AND LOOK AT THIS 
IT HAS THESE TREMENDOUS GNARLED WEATHERED MEDALLIONS 
I SUPPOSE ROMAN EMPERORS 
AND AT THE VERY HEART OF THE CITY SITS SANTO DOMINGO'S MOST IMPORTANT BUILDING 
THE FIRST CATHEDRAL OF THE AMERICAS 
THIS IS THE MAIN ENTRANCE TO THE CATHEDRAL THE WEST FRONT 
IT'S DESIGNED IN A RATHER MANNERED CLASSICAL STYLE KNOWN AS PLATERESQUE 
BECAUSE ITS DETAIL'S INSPIRED BY THE DESIGN OF SILVER PLATE 
NOW THE HORIZONTAL CARVED FRIEZE UP THERE IS VERY INTRIGUING 
IT SHOWS THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS FACED BY THE SPANIARDS AS THEY SAILED HERE 
THERE ARE FRIGHTFUL SEA MONSTERS THERE AND IN THAT CORNER WHAT I AM TOLD ARE WANTON NYMPHS 
AND INSIDE THE BUILDING'S GOTHIC WITH IT'S RIB VAULTS AND POINTED ARCHES AND LOOK AT THE SCALE OF IT 
JUST IMAGINE HOW IMPRESSIVE THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN WHEN NEW 
THIS RELIGIOUS ARCHITECTURE OF THE OLD WORLD 
SUDDENLY ARRIVING HERE IN THE NEW WORLD IN A STRANGE AND ALIEN LAND 
AND BEING STONE VAULTED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A TREMENDOUS SORT OF 
SACRED VESSEL A SOUNDING BOARD FOR THE MASSES CHANTED BY THE PRIESTS 
BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF SANTO DOMINGO LIES NOT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS 
IT LIES IN THE VERY LAYOUT OF THE CITY 
THE LAYOUT IS LIKE A CODED DIAGRAM OF THE BELIEFS AND IDEALS OF THE MEN THAT CREATED IT 
SPREADING OUT FROM THE CATHEDRAL'S SQUARE IS A RIGHT ANGULAR GRID 
DIVIDING THE CITY INTO NEAT PLOTS 
ITS INSPIRATION LAY IN ANCIENT ROMAN AND GREEK TOWN PLANNING AS REDISCOVERED IN THE RENAISSANCE 
AND ITS RATIONAL GEOMETRY WAS INTENDED TO EXPRESS ORDER AND CONTROL 
THE VIRTUES OF THE GRID PLAN SPREAD ACROSS THE AMERICAS THROUGH A SET OF RULES CALLED THE LAWS OF THE INDIES 
IT WOULD BECOME THE MOST IMPORTANT PLANNING DOCUMENT IN HUMAN HISTORY 
THE CONQUEST OF THE AMERICAS WAS LAUNCHED FROM HERE SPREADING SPANISH INFLUENCE AND THE GRID PLAN 
IT MAY SEEM EXTRAORDINARY BUT SANTO DOMINGO PROVIDED THE BLUEPRINT FOR A NEW CIVILISATION 
BUT THE COLONISTS' DREAM OF ORDER AND PROSPERITY WAS A NIGHTMARE FOR OTHERS 
THIS IS THE ALCAZAR DE COLON THE VICEROY'S FORTIFIED PALACE 
THIS IS THE GREAT CHAMBER 
INCREDIBLE TO THINK THAT FROM THIS ROOM 
FOR SOME YEARS THE SPANISH EMPIRE OF THE NEW WORLD WAS RULED 
THIS WAS THE EPICENTRE OF SPANISH POWER 
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF ARCHITECTURE BUT IT'S ALSO THE MONUMENT TO THE POWER 
OF ONE PEOPLE OVER ANOTHER AND THAT RELATIONSHIP WAS PRESENT EVEN DURING CONSTRUCTION 
THE DESIGNERS WERE SPANISH MASTER MASONS 
THE WORKFORCE WAS OVER A THOUSAND LOCAL ISLANDERS 
AND TO REALISE THIS DESIGN THEY WERE VIRTUALLY ENSLAVED 
AND WHEN THE ISLANDERS STARTED DYING IN DROVES LABOUR WAS SHIPPED IN FROM AFRICA 
THE TRANSATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE BEGAN HERE 
TOBACCO WAS ANOTHER NATIVE RESOURCE EXPLOITED BY THE SPANISH 
NOW CIGARS ARE ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST FAMOUS EXPORTS 
HI HOLA 
FRANKLIN HI HOW ARE YOU 
O. K. SO CAN I HAVE A GO YES SIT DOWN 
RIGHT PUT IT ALL IN HERE O. K. YEAH 
YES THAT'S KIND OF NOT TOO BAD SO FAR 
PUSH IT DOWN 
YES O. K. AND PULL THAT PULL THAT OVER 
THEN HOLD IT LIKE THAT 
NOT AH TO THERE 
O. K. I HOLD THAT THERE 
TO FINISH RIGHT TO THE END YES 
O. K. AND NOW BACK 
O. K. OOH 
THAT'S LOOKING KIND OF ALMOST THERE ISN'T IT 
AND THEN I STICK IT IN THE GUILLOTINE AND CUT MY FINGER OFF 
LITTLE BIT ODD THIS CIGAR 
RATHER ECCENTRIC NOVEL CIGAR BUT DAMN IT IT'S MINE 
SO WHAT DO PEOPLE HERE NOW THINK OF COLUMBUS 
SO WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF COLUMBUS'S TROUBLED LEGACY 
THE SPANIARDS WERE LIKE THE HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE 
THEY BROUGHT DEATH AND DISEASE 
AND AS WITH ALL IMPERIAL POWERS 
HELL DID FOLLOW AFTER THEM 
BUT IT'S VERY CURIOUS ISN'T IT 
BECAUSE IF HE HADN'T COME IF SPAIN HADN'T BEEN HERE NONE OF THIS WOULD EXIST 
THIS IS NOW A FUSION OF CULTURES A MIX OF PEOPLE 
AND IT SEEMS TO BE A VERY HEALTHY VERY LIVELY VERY TOLERANT ONE 
THIS IS MERENGUE 
A MIXTURE OF SPANISH AND AFRICAN MUSICAL INFLUENCES ALL HERE IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 
AND TONIGHT I'M GOING TO EXPERIENCE A LITTLE CULTURAL FUSION FIRST HAND 
SANTO DOMINGO IS THE REALISATION OF A RUTHLESS DREAM 
BUT IT'S ALSO A MODEL OF CIVILISATION A CITY THAT CONTINUES TO BE AN INSPIRATION TO THE WORLD 
THIS IS PHILADELPHIA ON THE EAST COAST OF AMERICA 
A CITY THAT ONCE DREAMED OF CONSTRUCTING SOCIETY ANEW 
THE AMERICAN DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WAS ADOPTED HERE IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX 
IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED THESE STREETS WERE AWASH WITH REVOLUTIONARY FERVOUR 
BUT OF ALL THE BUILDINGS TO EMERGE FROM THIS TIME OF HEADY IDEALISM 
THE BIGGEST THE BOLDEST AND THE MOST IMPRESSIVE 
WAS A PRISON 
EASTERN STATE PENITENTIARY OPENED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY NINE 
THIS WASN'T JUST A BUILDING BUT EXPRESSION OF A MISSION A MISSION TO SOLVE SOCIETY'S ILLS 
THE CASTLE LIKE EXTERIOR MAY LOOK INTIMIDATING SEVERE AND DAUNTING 
BUT SURPRISINGLY FOR THOSE WHO CREATED THE PRISON IT WAS TO BE A PLACE OF HOPE 
AN EXPRESSION OF A BELIEF THAT GOODNESS LURKS IN EVEN THE DARKEST OF SOULS 
THE CENTURY BEFORE PRISONS HAD BEEN BRUTAL AND VIOLENT PLACES 
THEY WERE OVERCROWDED CORRUPTING AND DISEASE RIDDEN 
BEATING AND PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT WERE THE NORM 
ABUSE WAS RIFE 
NEW PRISONERS WOULD BE ROBBED BY EXISTING PRISONERS AND IF THE 
NEW PRISONERS DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY THEY'D BE RELIEVED OF THEIR CLOTHES AND END UP VIRTUALLY NAKED 
BUT IN EASTERN STATE THERE WOULD BE ORDER AND SOLITARY CONFINEMENT 
THE PRISON'S NOW AN AMAZINGLY EVOCATIVE RUIN 
A STABILISED RUIN I'M TOLD BUT QUITE HOW ONE STABILISES DECAY LIKE THIS I'M NOT SURE 
TIME AND ROT ARE TAKING THEIR TOLL 
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS REALLY 
IT'S INCREDIBLY PICTURESQUE INCREDIBLY ROMANTIC 
IT REALLY IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL PLACES I'VE BEEN TO 
THE INNER CELL BLOCK HAS A CATHEDRAL LIKE QUALITY 
IT'S LIKE BEING IN A NAVE 
I GUESS RELIGION'S A KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THIS PRISON 
ITS CREATORS HAD STRONG QUAKER BELIEFS AND THEY THOUGHT 
THAT THROUGH ARCHITECTURE THEY COULD ACHIEVE A MORAL REFORM 
THEY THOUGHT PRISONERS HERE ISOLATED WOULD BECOME 
INTROSPECTIVE TURN TO GOD AND SEE THE ERROR OF THEIR WAYS 
THESE REFORMERS BELIEVED IN THE ESSENTIAL GOODNESS OF MANKIND 
THEIR DREAM WAS TO CREATE A MACHINE FOR SAVING SOULS 
THEY DIDN'T SEE THIS AS A PLACE OF PUNISHMENT BUT SOMEWHERE WHERE 
PRISONERS WOULD ACHIEVE REDEMPTION THROUGH SOLITUDE AND REFLECTION 
THE FIRST PRISONERS ARRIVED IN THE AUTUMN OF ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY NINE AMONGST THEM CHARLES WILLIAMS 
AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD FARMER FOUND GUILTY OF STEALING A GOLD WATCH 
BEGINNING HIS SOLITARY CONFINEMENT HE WAS LED TO HIS CELL IN A HOOD 
TO KEEP HIM FREE FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF OTHER INMATES' 
AND HERE HE SPENT THE NEXT TWO YEARS 
THIS CELL'S A MODERN RECONSTRUCTION AND IT MAKES A VERY POWERFUL IMPRESSION 
WILLIAMS WOULD HAVE BEEN ALONE FOR MONTH AFTER MONTH AFTER MONTH 
HE WASN'T ALLOWED TO SEE OTHER PRISONERS 
HE WAS FORBIDDEN VISITORS NOT EVEN HIS FAMILY COULD SEE HIM 
THERE WAS NO READING MATTER APART FROM THE BIBLE 
A BOOK HE WOULD HAVE GOT TO KNOW VERY WELL INDEED 
HE WAS ALLOWED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HONEST LABOUR MAKING CHAIRS 
CARPENTRY MENDING SHOES AND THERE WAS VIRTUALLY NO DAYLIGHT 
THE LIGHT COMING THROUGH THIS GRILL WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE IN HIS TIME 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OPEN DOOR BEYOND 
ALL HE HAD WAS A LITTLE PORTHOLE 
THROUGH THAT HE WOULD HAVE MEASURED TIME 
THE PRISONERS CALLED THAT PORTHOLE THE EYE OF GOD 
BEHIND EACH CELL AND CONNECTED VIA THE METAL GRILL DOOR WAS A HIGH WALLED 
PEN LIKE EXERCISE YARD AND INTO THIS SPACE A PRISONER 
WOULD BE RELEASED TWICE A DAY EACH PERIOD OF EXERCISE LASTING A MERE HALF AND HOUR 
HE WOULD FROM HERE GET A VIEW OF THE SKY BUT 
EACH CELL HAS ITS OWN INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE YARD SO EVEN HERE THE PRISONER WOULD HAVE BEEN ALONE 
ARCHITECTURE WAS CENTRAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE NEW PENAL SYSTEM 
LONG CORRIDORS ENSURED IMMENSE SIGHT LINES 
DISCIPLINE WAS TO BE ENFORCED NOT THROUGH BEATINGS BUT THROUGH A WORLD OF CONSTANT OBSERVATION 
AND AT CORE OF EASTERN STATE WAS ITS RADIAL PLAN WITH BUILDINGS ARRANGED LIKE THE SPOKES OF A WHEEL 
NEVER BEFORE HAD A PRISON EMBRACED THE SCIENCE OF REFORM ON SUCH A LARGE SCALE 
SURVEILLANCE WAS OF PRIME IMPORTANCE 
FROM THIS CENTRAL OBSERVATION TOWER RADIATE A SERIES OF CELL BLOCKS AND GUARDS DOWN BELOW HERE 
COULD MONITOR MOVEMENT IN EACH BLOCK BY LOOKING DOWN THE CORRIDORS THAT RUN THROUGH THE CENTRE OF EACH ONE 
SO THIS REPRESENTS A NEW RATIONAL THEORY ABOUT THE HOUSING 
AND TREATMENT OF PRISONERS AND THAT MADE EASTERN STATE PENITENTIARY OF INTENSE INTEREST AT THE TIME 
IT WAS GREATLY ADMIRED AND BECAME THE MOST INFLUENTIAL PRISON IN THE WORLD 
BUT WHAT WAS INTENDED TO MAKE MEN GOOD OFTEN SIMPLY MADE THEM MAD 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY TWO CHARLES DICKENS VISITED THE PRISON 
HE WAS HORRIFIED BY THE EFFECTS OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT ON ITS INMATES 
HE WROTE IN HIS AMERICAN NOTES FOR GENERAL CIRCULATION 
THAT HE FOUND THE SLOW AND DAILY TAMPERING 
WITH THE MYSTERIES OF THE BRAIN TO BE IMMEASURABLY WORSE THAN ANY TORTURE OF THE BODY 
AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED THE PENITENTIARY WAS HOPELESS CRUEL AND WRONG 
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IS NOW RECOGNISED AS A WAY 
OF BREAKING DOWN HUMAN RESOLVE OF CAUSING LOSS OF IDENTITY 
DISORIENTATION 
AND IN JAILS TODAY IT'S REGARDED AS A VERY SEVERE FORM OF PUNISHMENT 
ONE DOES WONDER WHAT THE AUTHORITIES WERE THINKING ABOUT HERE ORIGINALLY 
MANY OF THE INMATES MUST HAVE BEEN VERY MENTALLY FRAGILE 
EVEN IF THE AUTHORITIES' INTENTIONS WERE GOOD 
THEY CLEARLY MUST HAVE CAUSED IMMENSE PSYCHOLOGICAL DAMAGE 
GRADUALLY AT EASTERN STATE ATTITUDES TO INCARCERATION SOFTENED 
BUT ONE PRISONER WHO ARRIVED IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT STILL FOUND IT AN AWFUL PLACE 
ONE DAY I MADE A MISTAKE 
I ROBBED YEAH 
I WAS THE HOODED BANDIT 
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALLED ME 
THE HOODED BANDIT STEAL SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PAYROLL WITH MONEY TO BURN 
AND WE'RE IN THIS CELL BECAUSE THIS WAS YOUR FIRST CELL 
MY FIRST CELL YEAH EIGHTEEN CELL HERE ON TEN BLOCK 
WHAT DID IT MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE LIVING IN A ROOM WITHOUT A PROPER WINDOW 
IT WAS ENCLOSED YOU DON'T SO YOU WENT OUT OF YOUR MIND 
YOU BLOCK OUT ALL OF IT YOU'RE JUST CONFINED 
DID YOU KNOW EVERYBODY WHO LIVED ON YOUR BLOCK SO TO SPEAK 
I KNEW EVERYBODY WHO LIVED ON THIS BLOCK HERE 
OH SO WHO LIVED IN THIS CELL FOR EXAMPLE 
STUMPY STUMPY 
YEAH FROM HARRISBURG 
RIGHT SO WHAT WAS HE IN HERE FOR 
HOMICIDE OH REALLY 
ANOTHER LIFE LONG ONE 
WHAT WAS THE ATMOSPHERE LIKE AT NIGHT ON THE BLOCK 
AFTER THE LIGHTS HAD BEEN TURNED OFF IT WAS VERY QUIET 
THE ONLY THING YOU COULD HEAR AT NIGHT SOMETIMES SOMEBODY CRYING OUT FOR MAMA OR PRAYING 
LORD I DIDN'T MEAN IT BUT HE HAD DONE IT SO YOU HAD TO DO YOUR TIME YOU COME IN HERE 
YOU COULD HEAR DIFFERENT INMATES CRYING AT NIGHT 
YOU MIGHT THINK THEY WERE GROWN MEN BUT THEY CRIED LIKE BABIES 
EASTERN STATE SHUT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE 
DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IT CHANGED THE FORM OF PRISONS ALL OVER THE GLOBE 
BUT TODAY IT STANDS AS A MONUMENT TO THE TYRANNY OF IDEALS' 
THE KINGDOM OF BHUTAN TUCKED AWAY IN THE HIMALAYAS 
IS A SECRET LAND ISOLATED FROM THE MODERN WORLD 
HERE THE KING HAS A DREAM TO EMBRACE THE PAST 
AND HE'S USING ARCHITECTURE TO ACHIEVE HIS VISION 
THE KING'S DREAM FOR BHUTAN SHOULD PRODUCE A SORT OF UTOPIA I'D LIKE TO LIVE IN WHERE CONSERVING 
THE PAST IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RUTHLESS DEMANDS OF MODERNISATION 
BUT TO REALISE SUCH A BOLD DREAM HAS INVOLVED SOME VERY STRICT 
ENFORCEMENT AND I'M GOING TO GO AND SEE HOW IT ALL WORKS 
I'M ON THE ROAD TO THIMPU THE CAPITAL CITY OF BHUTAN 
AS I TRAVEL THE MOUNTAINS AND VALLEYS ALL AROUND ME ARE FULL OF GLORIOUS TRADITIONAL ARCHITECTURE 
THIMPU IS ONE OF THE SMALLEST CAPITALS THAT I'VE VISITED 
AND CERTAINLY THE ONLY ONE WITHOUT ANY TRAFFIC LIGHTS 
WITH ONLY ONE MAIN STREET THIMPU IS CERTAINLY MODEST 
BUT ON THE OUTSKIRTS THERE'S AN ARCHITECTURAL GLORY 
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT BUILDING IN BHUTAN 
IT'S CALLED THE TASCHICHHO DZONG WHICH MEANS THE FORTRESS OF GLORIOUS RELIGION 
IT'S WHERE THE KING THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CHIEF ABBOT ARE BASED 
WHICH MEANS THAT ALL MATTERS SECULAR AND RELIGIOUS ARE DECIDED 
AND CONTROLLED FROM THIS POWERHOUSE 
AND WITHIN THE MIGHTY WALL IS THIS HUGE COURTYARD 
WHAT A GLORIOUS SPACE 
OVER THERE ARE THE QUARTERS OCCUPIED BY THE KING AND THE GOVERNMENT 
AND THIS SIDE IS MONASTIC AND INDEED I CAN HEAR THESE HORNS OF MONKS AT THEIR MORNING PRAYER 
YOU CAN TELL THE MONASTIC BUILDINGS 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THESE DEEP RED STRIPES PAINTED ON THEM 
GOLLY AND ALL ROUND ONE HAS NATURE THE HILLS NOW TOPPED WITH CLOUDS 
IT'S WONDERFUL 
BUT NOT ALL IS AS IT SEEMS 
THE GREATEST SECRET OF THIS BUILDING IS ITS AGE 
IT LOOKS ANCIENT AND IN FACT THERE WAS A DZONG BUILT ON THIS SITE IN THE LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY BUT VIRTUALLY 
EVERYTHING YOU SEE NOW DATES FROM THE NINETEEN SIXTIES IT'S INCREDIBLE 
IT REVEALS SO MUCH ABOUT BHUTAN 
HISTORY IS SO REVERED HERE THAT ALL MODERN BUILDINGS MUST PAY TRIBUTE TO THE PAST 
AND NOT JUST THEIR EXTERIORS BUT THEIR INTERIORS TOO 
THIS IS THE ASSEMBLY HALL FOR THE MONKS AND IS RATHER OBVIOUSLY UNDER REPAIR 
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE ROOM 
CARVINGS EVERYWHERE AND BEAUTIFUL PAINTINGS AND IN FRONT OF ME 
THE GREAT GIANT IMAGE OF THE BUDDHA 
THE MAIN IMAGE OF THE BUDDHA IN THIS FORTRESS MONASTERY 
THE DZONG WAS JUST A START 
IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE KING ISSUED A SET OF ARCHITECTURAL RULES 
THAT WOULD KEEP ANCIENT BUILDING TRADITIONS ALIVE 
NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED ARTISANS WERE TRAINED IN TRADITIONAL BUILDING TECHNIQUES 
AND ISSUED WITH PATTERN BOOKS SHOWING ACCEPTABLE DETAILS SUCH AS CORNICES AND WINDOWS 
AND IN EACH DISTRICT THE KING ORDERED THAT A PROTOTYPE HOUSE 
BE BUILT THAT PEOPLE COULD SEE HOW THEY OUGHT TO BUILD THEIR OWN HOMES AND THIS IS ONE OF THE PROTOTYPES 
NICE DETAILS GOOD TIMBER LOVELY CORNICE I SUPPOSE TAKEN FROM THE PATTERN BOOK 
AND LET'S SEE YES THE GROUND FLOOR IS INDEED BUILT TRADITIONALLY ON BEATEN EARTH 
AND DOTTED AROUND THIMPU ARE BUILDINGS THAT EVOKE THE OLD BHUTAN WITH STARTLING ACCURACY 
AND IT DIDN'T STOP WITH BUILDINGS 
THE KING ALSO DECREED THAT EVERYONE SHOULD WEAR NATIONAL COSTUME 
I DECIDED I HAD TO GET MYSELF KITTED OUT 
HOW MUCH WILL I HAVE TO TAKE OFF IN THIS RATHER PUBLIC PLACE 
WHATEVER YOU LIKE 
IT SEEMS SURPRISINGLY EASY I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO 
BE MORE AH IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S TOO BIG 
OH I SEE YOU'RE PULLING DOWN THE SLEEVES OF THE SHIRT 
TURN ROUND THIS IS IT THIS IS THE FRIGHTFUL MOMENT WHEN MY GIRTH GIVES ME AWAY 
SO WHAT HAPPENS IN A PUBLIC PLACE ONE DOESN'T WEAR THIS BUT WEARS WESTERN CLOTHES 
IS ONE FINED BY THE POLICE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
ONLY TO ENFORCE THE RULES AMONG THE YOUNGER PEOPLE YEAH 
IT WAS FINED ABOUT SEVEN DOLLARS 
SEVEN DOLLARS FOR WEARING JEANS IN PUBLIC 
AH YEAH IN PUBLIC BUT NOW IT IS NORMAL 
OH IT DOESN'T HAPPEN 
IT WAS JUST TO REINFORCE THE RULE 
YEAH NICE LEGS 
LONG TIME SINCE SOMEONE SAID THAT TO ME 
WE ALSO WANT MODERNISATION TO HAPPEN BUT NOT AT THE COST OF 
YES 
IT SEEMS TO ME PERFECT THIS ISN'T IT EMBLEMATIC 
HERE WE ARE THE FABRIC'S MADE HERE IT'S YOUR STYLE OF CLOTHES AND UM 
IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE IT'S NOT OLD OR NEW IT'S JUST A FUNCTIONAL GARMENT AND AMAZINGLY COMFORTABLE 
IT LOOKS WELL ON YOU THANK YOU DOES IT YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
IT LOOKS VERY WELL ON YOU 
IN THE EVENING DOWNTOWN THIMPU IS A BIT TAMER THAN YOUR AVERAGE WESTERN CITY 
THE MOST POPULAR PASTIME IS KAROM 
A SORT OF COMPLICATED SHOVE HA'PENNY 
SURPRISINGLY IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE THE KING DECIDED TELEVISION 
WOULDN'T THREATEN THE COUNTRY'S CULTURAL IDENTITY 
MORE RECENTLY BHUTAN HELD ITS FIRST DEMOCRATIC ELECTION 
EVEN SO THE NATION CONTINUES TO EMBRACE THE PAST 
ESPECIALLY IN THE MOUNTAINS WHERE I'M HEADING TOMORROW 
NEXT MORNING I TAKE A FIVE HOUR DRIVE AWAY FROM THE CAPITAL 
WELL I FINALLY ARRIVED AT THE VILLAGE OF SHENGAN AFTER A LONG AND BUMPY RIDE 
AND THERE IS A WELCOMING COMMITTEE FOR ME 
MY GOODNESS I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS 
I JOIN ON BEHIND THE CHILDREN 
THESE CHAPS ALL THE TIME BLOWING THEIR MASSIVE HORNS 
THANK YOU 
I SUPPOSE THIS IS THE HOUSE I'VE COME TO SEE THAT'S WHY THE PROCESSION LED ME HERE 
THAT LITTLE CEREMONY WAS TO APPEASE A LOCAL DEITY 
TO PROTECT THE HOUSE THE INHABITANTS AND ME WHICH IS VERY THOUGHTFUL OF THEM ISN'T IT 
THE BUILDING IS AMAZING VERY BIG IT CERTAINLY LOOKS ITS AGE 
I'VE BEEN TOLD IT'S BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
OBVIOUSLY THE HOUSE ORIGINALLY OF A RATHER WELL TO DO FARMER 
AND I SUPPOSE SOMEWHERE HERE IS MY HOST AND HOSTESS WHO WILL BE ENTERTAINING ME LATER ON 
BUT A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING I MUST SAY 
BEATEN EARTH CONSTRUCTION 
TIMBER ABOVE 
ALL THE DETAIL EXPOSED BECAUSE THE PAINT HAS FLAKED OFF 
HOWEVER THE FIRST THING IS BEFORE GOING INSIDE HAVE A LITTLE LOOK AT THE BUILDING FROM AFAR 
GO UP THERE AND INSPECT IT IN THE LANDSCAPE 
WHEN THIS HOUSE WAS BUILT INDEED UNTIL RECENT YEARS ARCHITECTURE WAS AN ALIEN IDEA IN BHUTAN 
PEOPLE CREATED THEIR OWN ARCHITECTURE THEY CREATED THE BUILDINGS THEY NEEDED 
INFORMATION WOULD BE PASSED BY WORD OF MOUTH FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION 
FROM CRAFTSMAN TO CRAFTSMAN THERE WERE NO TEXTBOOKS NO DRAWINGS 
PEOPLE HAD SIMPLY HAD LEARNED THE BEST WAY TO BUILD TO SUIT THEIR NEEDS 
TO SUIT THE LANDSCAPE WHICH GIVES THESE BUILDINGS A TIMELESS BEAUTY 
THEY MAKE THEM I DON'T KNOW JUST LOOK ABSOLUTELY PERFECT IN THEIR SETTING 
ORIGINALLY THE HOUSE WOULD HAVE BEEN PAINTED 
WHITE WITH A LIME WASH AND ON THAT IMAGES NORMALLY BUDDHIST IMAGES 
OR IMAGES TO DISPEL EVIL SPIRITS 
A POPULAR IMAGE AROUND HERE IS A GREAT PHALLUS 
THAT WAS MEANT TO BE A VERY SORT OF BENEFICIAL IMAGE TO HAVE PLASTERED OUTSIDE ONE'S HOME 
THE TRADITIONAL BHUTANESE HOME IS PERFECTLY TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF THE LOCAL FARMERS 
THE GROUND FLOOR IS OCCUPIED BY THEIR CATTLE 
WHO RETIRE INTO THE HOUSE AT NIGHT SAFE FROM MOUNTAIN TIGERS 
IT'S RATHER LIKE CLAMBERING ABOARD A SHIP THIS UP THIS RICKETY STAIRCASE 
AND THERE'S THE FRONT DOOR OVER THERE 
AND AH WELL THE PAINTED PHALLUSES MAY FADE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING BUT HERE ABOVE THE DOOR 
IS A PHALLUS IN FACT FOUR IN WOOD FORMING A CROSS 
OF COURSE IT'S THERE TO WARD OFF EVIL SPIRITS BUT NEVER THE LESS I WILL GO INSIDE 
THIS VERY DARK FIRST FLOOR CONTAINS NOTHING BUT STOREROOMS 
AND LIGHT UP HERE SEEMS TO BE LEADING ME TO THE LIVING QUARTERS 
THIS HOUSE ONLY GOT ELECTRICITY EIGHT MONTHS AGO 
IMAGINE HOW GLOOMY IT WAS BEFORE THAT 
HELLO HELLO HELLO 
CAN I HAVE A LITTLE LOOK AT YOUR HOUSE PLEASE 
IS THAT ALL RIGHT IF I HAVE A WANDER ROUND THEN I BELIEVE I'M JOINING YOU A LITTLE BIT LATER FOR A MEAL 
OVER THE STAIR'S OVER HERE IS IT 
GOLLY STAIRCASE IS ONE WAY OF PUTTING IT 
THIS IS SIMPLY A PLANK VIRTUALLY HALF A TREE JUST WITH A. 
FOOT AND HAND HOLD JUST CUT OUT OF IT 
IT'S NOT TOO BAD ACTUALLY H. M. M. 
WELL WHAT COULD THIS ROOM BE 
AH HERE WE ARE OF COURSE IT'S LIKE THE FAMILY CHAPEL 
HERE'S A BUDDHIST SHRINE 
THE PEOPLE OF BHUTAN REMAIN VERY RELIGIOUS AND MOST HOUSES HAVE THEIR OWN SHRINES THIS ONE IS 
VERY WELL APPOINTED VERY BEAUTIFUL 
THIS HOUSE IS FOUR STOREYS BUT THERE'S A FIFTH LEVEL A FLAT AREA JUST BELOW THE PITCHED ROOF 
I'M GOING UP THERE TO INSPECT IT 
CLIMBING THIS ASTONISHING DEVICE THIS SORT OF THING IT'S REALLY 
WELL MY FEET ARE TOO BIG FOR THE RUNG THINGS OH LORD UM 
AH SORT OF AM I GETTING THE HANG OF IT NOT REALLY 
AH THIS FIFTH LEVEL OPEN TO THE ELEMENTS IS ALSO LARGELY GIVEN OVER TO STORAGE 
OVER THERE I CAN SEE WHEAT AND UP THERE WHEAT DRYING 
WALKING INTO THIS HOUSE IS ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKING 
IT'S LIKE STEPPING INTO THE PAST AND THE MIDDLE AGES 
WHAT'S CLEAR IS THAT RURAL BHUTAN IS A PLACE FROZEN IN TIME 
I RETURN HELLO 
HAVING INSPECTED YOUR WONDERFUL ANCIENT HOUSE I'LL SIT HERE 
THANK YOU YOU'RE OH THANK YOU 
KEEPING MY SHOES ON 
OH 
SO 
THESE ARE ALL THE LOCAL FARMERS ARE THEY 
YES THEY ARE ALL FARMERS FROM THE VILLAGE 
THEY ARE ALL COUSINS RELATIVES AND MEMBER OF THE FAMILY 
YES AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIVE IN THIS HOUSE 
THERE ARE SEVEN OF THEM 
FATHER MOTHER AND CHILDREN 
SEVEN OF THEM RIGHT AND THEY ALL LIVE SLEEP IN THIS BIG ROOM 
SO THE BEDS COME OUT AT NIGHT AFTER THIS AND EVERYONE GOES TO SLEEP 
YES INCREDIBLE THE MAIN LIVING ROOM ALSO THE KITCHEN I SEE 
PEOPLE ARE HAPPY WITH THIS THEN 
YOU KNOW THE CONTINUITY WITH THE TRADITIONAL WAYS OF LIFE GOING ON AND ON 
YES PEOPLE ARE HAPPY VERY HAPPY WITH THE LIFE THAT WE LEAD HERE 
BECAUSE ONCE IN A WHILE THEY DO GET TO GO OUT TO THE URBAN CITY AND THEY SEE THE CHAOS LIFE THERE YES 
AND THEY ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE LIFE HERE 
IT IS TRULY A VERY BUDDHIST SENTIMENT TO LIVE A VERY BASIC LIFE 
YOU MAKE DO WITH WHAT YOU HAVE AND YOU MAKE DO WITH WHAT IS ENOUGH 
SPEAKING OF THE RICE 
I REALLY WANT TO GET MY RICE YES 
BHUTAN IS A FASCINATING EXPERIMENT 
A RADICAL ATTEMPT TO KEEP THE PAST ALIVE IN A MODERN AND OFTEN ALARMING WORLD 
I KNOW IT WOULDN'T SUIT EVERYONE BUT TO ME IT SEEMS ADMIRABLE 
THIS IS MY DREAM OF ARCHITECTURE
