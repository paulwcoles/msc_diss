SO I HAVE SUMMONED SIXTEEN OF MY FINEST WARRIORS 
TO A LAND FAR TO THE EAST WHERE THEY MUST UNDERGO MANY TRIALS 
TO FIND THE MAGICAL WATERS THAT CAN BREAK THIS SPELL 
BUT MY OLD ENEMY HAS FOLLOWED ME HERE 
AND HE MEANS TO STOP THIS QUEST 
THE QUEST TO DISCOVER THE SECRET TEMPLE 
EACH OF THE TEAMS HAS COMPLETED 
THREE OF THE FOURTEEN TESTS THEY MUST ENDURE 
BEFORE ANY ARE ALLOWED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY INTO THE SERPENT'S LAIR 
THE EAGLES WOLVES AND PANTHERS GAINED FOUR MORE JEWELS 
AND NOW EACH HAS A TOTAL OF SEVENTEEN 
BUT THE TIGERS ADDED ONLY ONE MORE TO THEIR COLLECTION 
AND NOW TRAIL THE OTHERS WITH SIX 
THEY MUST TAKE CARE NOT TO FALL FURTHER BEHIND 
AS THEY EXECUTE TODAY'S CHALLENGES 
TIGERS YOU HAVE BUT SIX JEWELS 
THAT IS NOT ENOUGH TO BRING BACK ANY WARRIORS THIS DAY 
MARCA DO YOU FEEL IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION TO BRING BACK HADAV 
AT THE PILLARS OF COURAGE 
YES BECAUSE WE NEARLY WON THE GAME AND WE NEED MORE WARRIORS 
SO WE CAN COLLECT MORE JEWELS SO IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION 
HADAV HOW DID YOU FEEL 
I'M GLAD THAT I'M BACK AND 
I WAS VERY RELIEVED WHEN I CAME BACK 
I'M GLAD WE BROUGHT HIM BACK I KNOW WE ROLLED THE DICE BUT 
IT WAS JUST THE FAIREST THING TO DO IT GAVE HIM A FIFTY TO FIFTY CHANCE 
I'M GLAD WE GOT HIM BACK I'D HAVE BEEN UPSET TO LOSE HIM 
THIS DAY THE WARRIORS WILL BE TESTED ON THEIR ACCURACY AGILITY 
SPEED AND COURAGE 
AS THEY FACE THE FOURTH OF THE FOURTEEN TASKS 
UNDER THE BURNING SUN OF THIS MYSTERIOUS LAND 
SO LET THE DAY'S CHALLENGES BEGIN 
EAGLES THE JEWELS YOU SEEK IN THIS PLACE 
ARE HIDDEN IN THE SACKS THAT RISE AND FALL BEFORE YOU NOW 
YOU MUST GAIN AT LEAST ONE JEWEL 
BEFORE YOU CAN PASS THE KEEPER OF THE GATE 
BUT REMEMBER THIS IS A TEST OF SPEED 
SHOULD YOU FAIL TO GAIN A SINGLE GEM BEFORE THE SECOND DRUM SOUNDS 
THE KEEPER OF THE GATE WILL PREVENT YOUR ESCAPE 
AND YOUR QUEST MAY BE AT AN END 
I'VE GOT IT HERE 
SPEED IS EVERYTHING IN THIS TEST AND SAMRA HAS INDEED BEEN SPEEDY 
HE ALONE AMONG THE EAGLES IS SAFE ALREADY 
YOU CAN DO IT GUYS COME ON FAST COME ON GUYS YOU CAN DO IT FAST 
FOR THE EAGLES YEAH 
THE SPIRITS THAT DWELL IN THIS STRANGE PLACE LISTEN BUT DO NOT SEE 
WOLVES IT IS YOUR AGILITY THAT IS BEING TESTED TODAY 
YOU MUST CRAWL AMONGST THESE CORDS TO RECOVER THE JEWELS 
BUT DO NOT DISTURB THEM 
FOR IF ANY OF YOU SHOULD TOUCH A SINGLE THREAD AND SHAKE THE BELL 
THAT MAY BE THE LAST SOUND YOU HEAR ON THIS QUEST 
RIGHT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S OPTIONAL WHETHER WE CAN COLLECT 
THE LEATHER POUCHES OR NOT 
SO WE SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON GETTING THROUGH IF YOU CAN GET THEM 
YEAH IF YOU THINK YOU CAN GET THEM 
GET THEM BUT I THINK IT'S BEST TO GET EVERYONE THROUGH 
TRY AND GET THERE THAT BIG GAP THERE 
ALL THREE WOLVES HAVE CHOSEN TO ENTER THE THREADS TOGETHER 
WILL THIS PROVE WISE 
BE VERY CAREFUL 
NEBRA THOUGH AGILE 
WAS NOT OBSERVANT ENOUGH AND FELL TO THE SPIRIT GUARDS 
WARRIORS YOU MUST USE THIS WEAPON 
TO DESTROY THE VESSELS YOU SEE BEFORE YOU 
AND RELEASE THE GEMS WITHIN THIS IS A TEST OF YOUR ACCURACY 
ACCURACY IS A SERVANT OF THE EYE SO AIM WELL AND AIM STEADILY 
DO NOT RUSH AT YOUR TARGET WHEN THE FIRST STONE IS RELEASED 
A DRUM WILL SOUND 
AT THE SOUND OF THE SECOND DRUM YOU MUST STOP FIRING 
AND LEAVE IMMEDIATELY WITH OR WITHOUT THE JEWELS 
MARCA JENRO HADAV AND SOHAR OF THE TIGERS 
HAVE FOUND THEIR RANGE QUICKLY 
BUT THEY MUST KNOCK THE POTS TO EARTH TO RETRIEVE THE GEMS 
KEEP AIMING FOR THE SAME ONE AND WE'LL EVENTUALLY HIT IT 
I'LL GO FOR THE ONE THAT WOBBLED 
WE SHOULD MOVE THE CATAPULT 
NO WE'LL MOVE IT OFF THE CENTRAL POSITION 
WELL DONE SOHAR 
EXCELLENT 
IT SEEMS THAT JENRO IS RIGHT MOVING THE CATAPULT WAS NOT A GOOD IDEA 
BUT WILL MARCA SEE IT THAT WAY 
PANTHERS IT IS YOUR COURAGE THAT IS ON TRIAL TODAY 
THE JEWELS YOU SEEK ARE SUSPENDED ABOVE THE NARROW PATHWAY 
EACH OF YOU MUST REACH HIGH TO RETRIEVE ONE OF THE POUCHES 
BE ASSURED THIS WILL NOT SEEM EASY WHEN YOU ARE BALANCED ON THIS LEDGE 
FOR FEAR IS THE ENEMY TODAY WARRIORS 
YOU MUST DEFEAT THAT ENEMY IF YOU WISH TO SUCCEED IN THIS TASK 
PANTHER LEADER SONRO IS FIRST TO FACE THE GREAT HEIGHT ON THE LEDGE 
WILL HIS COURAGE PREVAIL 
COME ON COME ON 
SAMRA AND KARJA HAVE BOTH FOUND JEWELS 
EAGLES TAYLAN AND YEADA MUST BE SWIFT 
TAYLAN IS NOW ALONE 
AS YEADA HAS RECOVERED A GEM 
DESOT AND LYMEL WORK ON WITHOUT FELLOW WOLF NEBRA

RAVEN NEVAR LEADS HIS DEMONS AWAY FROM THIS PLACE 
WHERE IS HE HEADING SATYARANI I KNOW NOT MAYBE TO THE CITADEL 
WHAT WILL YOU DO 
I WILL FOLLOW REMEMBER HE KNOWS WHERE YOU ARE AT ALL TIMES 
HE WILL LOOK IN THE ALL SEEING EYE 
AND SEE A BIRD FLYING IN THE CLOUDS SATYARANI 
HE LEARNS NOTHING FROM THAT 
COME ON KEEP TRYING THERE'S ANOTHER FEW IN THERE 
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN OPENED THAT HAVE FALLEN I CAN'T 
THERE'S ONE THAT HASN'T BEEN OPENED 
KEEP TRYING LOOK FOR THE EAGLE 
TAYLAN IS ALONE AMONG THE EAGLES WITHOUT A STONE 
HE MUST BE SWIFT IF HE IS NOT TO PERISH 
COME ON TAYLAN KEEP GOING 
YEAH COME ON COME ON TAKE IT KEEP GOING 
I CAN'T REACH IT ARE YOU SURE IT'S NOT IN THERE 
HE MUST NOT BECOME DOWNHEARTED 
A WARRIOR MUST NEVER GIVE UP YEAH GO ON

GRAB THAT ONE OVER THERE 
TRY IT KEEP TRYING COME ON KEEP JUMPING FOR IT 
YES YES COME ON THAT MIGHT BE IT COME ON KEEP GOING 
KEEP TRYING YOU KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS 
COME ON QUICK COME ON RUN 
YES WELL DONE 
WELL DONE IT WAS EXHAUSTING 
AND I WAS THE LAST MAN STANDING BUT I WAS SO RELIEVED 
WHEN I GOT THE JEWELS 
DESOT FOLLOWS A LONELY PATH AS BOTH LYMEL AND NEBRA ARE LOST 
DESOT A DECISION MUST BE MADE 
NEBRA AND LYMEL ARE LOST TO THE SPIRIT GUARDS 
BUT SATYARANI WILL ALLOW THE USE OF YOUR JEWELS TO BRING THEM BACK 
FOR EACH WARRIOR YOU MUST GIVE EIGHT JEWELS 
YOU MUST DECIDE TO KEEP THE JEWELS 
OR BE REUNITED WITH YOUR LOST COMRADES 
SO WHAT HAVE YOU DECIDED 
I'M GOING TO SAVE LYMEL 
BECAUSE I THINK SHE CAN OFFER A WIDER RANGE OF SKILLS TO THE TEAM 
SO BE IT EIGHT JEWELS ARE REQUIRED 
OH THANK YOU YES WELCOME BACK YES 
I WAS SO HAPPY THAT DESOT DECIDED TO BRING ME BACK 
I'M A BIT DISAPPOINTED THAT NEBRA'S NOT BACK 
BECAUSE SHE WAS A VERY GOOD WARRIOR BUT I'M REALLY PLEASED I'M BACK 
UNFORTUNATELY BOTH NEBRA AND LYMEL GOT KNOCKED OUT 
I WAS LEFT WITH A DIFFICULT DECISION 
BUT I DECIDED TO SAVE LYMEL 
BECAUSE I BELIEVE HER SKILLS BENEFIT THE TEAM MOST 
YES WELCOME BACK THANK YOU YES 
O. K. 
BACK IT A LITTLE MORE IF YOU CAN THAT'S IT THERE 
OH 
O. K. EVERYONE NEXT POT ALONG 
STILL THE TIGERS HAVE ONLY ONE GEM ASSURED 
THEIR AIM SEEMS TO HAVE DESERTED THEM O. K. 
NOW 
OH 
MOVE THESE BLOCKS BACK INTO POSITION O. K. I'LL FIRE THE BLOCKS 
RIGHT SOHAR 
COME ON YOU GUYS IT'S ALL RIGHT O. K. 
O. K. BACK GO WE DON'T HAVE LONG NOW 
STAY THERE SOHAR 
WHERE ARE YOU HAVING IT AGAIN 
NO YOU TAKE IT MARCA JUST COME TO WHERE I WAS 
THERE YEAH THEN GO DOWN A BIT DOWN A BIT 
GO TOO LOW

AND THAT GAVE IT LOTS OF POWER BUT JUST BRING IT UP TO ABOUT HERE 
COME BACK COME BACK RIGHT TRY THERE TRY THERE 
YES NOW 
OH 
O. K. COME ON YOU HAVE TO GET THIS 
GUYS JEWELS 
I THINK WE ALL PLAYED OUR PARTS IN THIS ONE 
AND IT LOOKED QUITE EASY BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT 
AND WE ONLY GOT ONE JEWEL 
JENRO REALLY GOT ON MY NERVES 
WE SHOULD CHANGE THE ANGLE OF THE CATAPULT 
I SUGGESTED WE SHOULD CHANGE THE CATAPULT TO GET A BETTER ANGLE 
TO SHOOT THE END PODS OFF WE CAN'T MOVE IT OFF THE CENTRE 
HE SAID WE SHOULD JUST LEAVE IT THERE IF WE HAD TURNED IT 
WE WOULD HAVE GOT MORE JEWELS GOT IT HEAD BACK 
ALL IS NOT WELL 
THE SERPENTS THAT SLEEP ON THESE STONES SLITHER AWAY 
AND THE AIR GROWS COLD 
I FEEL THE WARRIORS ARE IN DANGER SOMETHING COMES 
NEVAR TIGERS RUN TO THE SAFETY OF THE ROCKS QUICKLY 
DARK ONE YOUR AIM IS NOT TRUE 
BUT HERE IS AN EASIER TARGET FOR YOUR MISCHIEF 
NEVAR 
PLEASE RAVEN DO NOT GO AFTER HIM 
HE WILL AMBUSH YOU IF YOU PURSUE HIM NOW 
HE TRICKED ME HE USED THE DEMONS TO LURE ME AWAY FROM THE WARRIORS 
THEY ARE SAFE AYE 
BUT I MUST REMAIN VIGILANT FROM NOW ON 
NEVAR MEANS TO STOP THIS QUEST AT ANY COST 
GO ON SLOWLY 
DON'T LOOK DOWN TAKE YOUR TIME DON'T FALL OFF 
YONRA IS THE LAST PANTHER TO TACKLE THE LEDGE 
WILL HER COURAGE SERVE HER WELL AND WILL SHE TAKE THE LAST JEWEL 
YOU'RE GONNA SEE ONE BAG 
AND IF YOU CAN REACH OUT AND GRAB IT 
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO REMEMBER 
TRY YOUR BEST TO REACH IT 
SLOWLY REMEMBER SLOWLY 
SLOWLY YONRA 
CAREFULLY 
CAREFUL I GOT A JEWEL 
YAY 
YES 
THE EAGLES AND PANTHERS EACH GATHERED FOUR JEWELS THIS DAY 
BRINGING THEIR TOTAL TO TWENTY ONE GEMS APIECE 
BUT THE WOLVES GATHERED IN ONE GEM 
AT THE THRALL THREADS BUT LOST TWO OF THEIR COMRADES 
LYMEL AND NEBRA 
THEIR LEADER DESOT CHOSE TO BRING BACK LYMEL 
SO NOW THE TEAM HAVE TEN GEMS BUT ONLY TWO MARCH UNDER THAT BANNER 
THE TIGERS STILL HAVE ALL FOUR OF THEIR WARRIORS 
BUT THEIR TOTAL NOW STANDS AT A LOWLY SEVEN 
DESOT YOUR TEAM LOST TWO WARRIORS AT THE THRALL THREAD TASK 
YOU WERE THINKING OF YOURSELF AND FUTURE CHALLENGES 
WHEN YOU CHOSE ONLY TO BRING BACK LYMEL 
I WASN'T THINKING OF MYSELF 
BECAUSE IF I'D BROUGHT BACK NEBRA AND LYMEL WE'D ONLY HAVE TWO JEWELS 
AND THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR THE TEAM 
I BROUGHT BACK LYMEL INSTEAD OF NEBRA BECAUSE HER SKILLS BENEFIT US MOST 
LYMEL IF YOU HAD BEEN LEADER WOULD YOU HAVE BROUGHT BACK BOTH WARRIORS 
I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE TWO IS A SMALL NUMBER TO HAVE IN A TEAM 
BUT I DON'T THINK WE HAD ENOUGH JEWELS TO BRING BACK TWO WARRIORS 
THE SUN SETS AND THE WARRIORS REST 
I HAVE LEARNED A LESSON FROM THIS DAY 
NOT TO LEAVE THEIR SIGHT EVEN FOR AN INSTANT 
I KNOW NEVAR WILL NOT FACE ME DIRECTLY 
BUT HE WILL STRIVE TO ATTACK THESE BRAVE SOULS AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY 
HE DETERMINES TO STOP THE PROGRESS OF THIS QUEST 
BUT HE WILL NOT SUCCEED HE WILL BE DEFEATED 
THE WARRIORS WILL GO FORWARD TO THE CITADEL 
THE SECRET TEMPLE WILL BE FOUND 
NEXT TIME ON RAVEN 
THE SECRET TEMPLE 
NEBRA IS LOST AND THE WOLVES MUST ENCOUNTER FIELD OF THE DEAD 
THE TIGERS DECIPHER RIDDLE TRAP 
THE PANTHERS FACE THE BAKING HEAT IN OBELISKS OF THE SUN 
AND WILL THE EAGLES' ACCURACY PREVAIL IN GIANT CATAPULT 
NEVAR CONTINUES TO DOG OUR FOOTSTEPS AND ATTACKED TODAY 
WE MUST PREPARE AS HE AND HIS DEMONS GROW BOLDER
