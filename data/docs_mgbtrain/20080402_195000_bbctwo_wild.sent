THIS IS SQUAM LAKE NEW HAMPSHIRE U. S. A. 
BUT IT'S MORE FAMOUS AS GOLDEN POND 
FOR THIS IS WHERE THE OSCAR WINNING FILM STARRING 
HENRY FONDA AND KATHARINE HEPBURN WAS FILMED 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE 
BUT THE LAKE'S REAL LIFE CAST OF CHARACTERS 
ARE A FAR MORE ENTERTAINING BUNCH 
IT EVEN HAS ITS OWN KATHERINE HEPBURN 
KARLENE SCHWARTZ 
FOR FOUR DECADES SHE'S LIVED WITH THE LAKE'S EVERY MOOD 
AND GOT TO KNOW IT BETTER THAN ANYONE 
IT'S TOUGH TO LIVE THE WHOLE DAY THROUGH 
THINKING OF HER IS ALL I DO 
KARLENE IS THE PERFECT GUIDE 
TO SPENDING A SUMMER ON THE REAL GOLDEN POND 
PLEASE GO AWAY 
YES YES 
DON'T LET OLD LADIES CREEP UP ON YOU 
YOU'RE GETTING OLDER EACH DAY 
TIME AND TIDE WAITS FOR NOBODY 
SINCE SHE RETIRED FROM TEACHING BIOLOGY 
KARLENE SPENDS MOST OF HER TIME ON SQUAM LAKE 
SO WHAT IS IT THAT DRAWS HER TO THIS PLACE 
ONE THING I LOVE IS THE VARIETY OF EXPERIENCES HERE 
THE SCARLET OF THE TUPELO LEAVES DRIFTING ALONG THE SHORE 
THE WET SMELL WHEN THE WAVES ARE HIGH 
THE CHIPMUNK WITH ITS BIRD LIKE CALL 
THINKING THAT IT OWNS THE WORLD 
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT MAKE THE LAKE A VERY SPECIAL PLACE 
AS SUMMER BEGINS KARLENE HEADS OUT ONTO THE LAKE 
IN SEARCH OF SOME EARLY VISITORS 
PERHAPS THE LAKE'S MOST GRACEFUL INHABITANTS 
LOONS 
I THINK THAT PEOPLE FEEL LOONS ARE LOONY 
BECAUSE NO OTHER BIRD THAT I KNOW OF MAKES A SOUND LIKE CRAZY LAUGH 
IT'S NOT JUST THE LOONS' CRAZY CALL THAT GIVES THEM THEIR REPUTATION 
LOONS TAKE THE BUSINESS OF DEFENDING TERRITORIES VERY SERIOUSLY 
JUST NEVER SERIOUSLY ENOUGH TO TAKE OFF 
WITH A PIECE OF LAKE TO CALL HOME 
THE MALES SOON ATTRACT A MATE AND PREPARE TO START A FAMILY 
AS THE TREES BECOME FLUSH WITH LEAVES 
THE WORK OF ANOTHER LAKE RESIDENT BECOMES INCREASINGLY OBVIOUS 
YOU CAN SEE THE GNAW MARKS THAT THE TWO BIG FRONT TEETH HAVE MADE 
AS THEY WERE TAKING DOWN THE STUMP FOR THEIR DINNERS 
MOST OFTEN I LOOK FOR A V. SHAPED WAKE IN THE WATER 
AND THEY DIVE IF YOU GET TOO CLOSE TO THEM 
SLAP THE WATER WITH THEIR TALES 
WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A PERSON DIVING INTO THE WATER 
THE BEAVERS HAVE EATEN WOOD ALL WINTER 
BUT NOW THERE'S SOMETHING MORE SUCCULENT ON OFFER 
THE LENGTHENING DAYS ENCOURAGE THE WATER LILIES 
AND THE BEAVERS WILL HAPPILY MUNCH ON THEIR FLOWERS FOR HOURS 
BY MIDSUMMER THE LOON CHICKS HAVE HATCHED 
AND ARE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR FOOD 
BUT UNTIL THEY LOSE THOSE DOWNY FEATHERS 
IT'S UP TO MUM AND DAD TO FISH FOR THEM 
THESE YOUNG MERGANSERS ARE FAR MORE ADVENTUROUS 
AS FAR AS THE FISH ARE CONCERNED THEY'RE JUST OUT TO CAUSE TROUBLE 
THEY MAY LACK THE WINGS BUT YOU CAN'T FAULT THEIR ENTHUSIASM 
IT'S HOTTING UP 
BUT THE COOL LAKESIDE WOODLAND STILL YIELDS A FEW SURPRISES 
WHEN I WALK EARLY IN THE MORNING 
I SOMETIMES WILL MEET A DEER COMING TOWARD ME 
THROUGH THE WOODS 
AND THE DEER USUALLY STANDS VERY VERY STILL 
SOMETIMES THEY BOLT AND FLASH THEIR WHITE TAILS 
AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY 
YOU CAN FIND TAILS OF AN ALTOGETHER LESS FLUFFY KIND 
I HAVE SEEN PORCUPINES 
SOMETIMES YOU'LL SEE THEM WALKING IN THE FOREST 
THEY MIGHT BE NIBBLING ON HEMLOCK SEEDLINGS OR OTHER LEAVES 
THAT THEY FIND ON THE FOREST FLOOR 
EVEN CLIMBING TREES 
BACK ON THE LAKE THE DUCKS CAN STILL SQUEEZE IN A LATE BROOD 
AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FIRST FRUITS OF THE YEAR 
ONE DAY UNDER A BLUEBERRY BUSH 
I SAW THE HEN DUCK LEAP OUT OF THE WATER 
GRAB THE LOW HANGING BLUEBERRY FRUIT AND EAT BLUEBERRIES FROM THE WATER 
AT FIRST I WAS MAD BECAUSE IT WAS MY BLUEBERRY BUSH 
THEN I THOUGHT OH REALLY YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO SHARE HERE 
IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE 
BUT NOT EVERYONE CARES FOR SQUAM LAKE AS KARLENE DOES 
I HAVE LIVED ON OTHER LAKES THAT AREN'T CARED FOR 
WHERE MY FAMILY HAD A CAMP WHEN I WAS A KID 
HAD THE WETLAND FILLED WITH HOUSES THE LOONS DON'T NEST THERE ANY MORE 
THEY DON'T EVEN STOP BY FOR LUNCH 
SO IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IF PEOPLE TAKE CARE 
BECAUSE THESE THINGS MATTER 
WAITING ON AN ANGEL 
ONE TO CARRY ME HOME 
TODAY I MOVED A SINGLE SALAMANDER 
IT WAS TRUNDLING RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE OF A DIRT ROAD 
AND IT HEADED RIGHT BACK FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD 
BUT AT LEAST I FELT THAT I'D GIVEN HIM A CHANCE 
WHEN YOU'VE SEEN AS MANY SUMMERS AS KARLENE 
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WORTH SAVING 
THE BEAVERS ARE BUILDING WINTER LODGES 
THE YOUNG LOONS GROWN AND READY TO LEAVE 
AS AUTUMN ARRIVES KARLENE IS LEFT HOPING 
THAT OTHERS WILL COME TO SHARE HER LOVE OF GOLDEN POND 
WHETHER THEY GET IT THROUGH THE EYES OF A THREE YEAR OLD 
THAT HEARS A LOON'S CRAZY LAUGHTER FOR THE FIRST TIME 
I HOPE IT EVENTUALLY COMES TO EVERYBODY 
HOPE YOU COME SEE ME SOON 
COS I DON'T WANNA GO ALONE 
I DON'T WANNA GO ALONE 
DON'T WANNA GO I DON'T WANNA GO ALONE
