CONTAINS STRONG LANGUAGE THE FIRST DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE B. B. C. LORD REITH SAID 
THE PURPOSE OF T. V. WAS TO INFORM EDUCATE 
I THINK T. V. WILL HELP US MOST OF ALL IN THE SUBJECT OF GEOGRAPHY 
AND ENTERTAIN 
THEY USUALLY MISS OUT THE NEXT BIT OF THE QUOTE WHEN HE SAID IT SHOULD 
ALSO MAKE YOU DROP YOUR CHIPS SPIT YOUR TEA OUT AND SCREAM WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE 
IN THE EARLY DAYS OF T. V. 
EVERYTHING WENT OUT LIVE NO TAPES WERE MADE 
SO NO RECORD SURVIVES WE CAN ONLY IMAGINE 
WHAT MADNESS WAS BROADCAST IN THE NAME OF ENTERTAINMENT 
BUT THOSE EARLY PIONEERS 
WERE JUST PRACTISING HONING THEIR SKILLS 
THE GOLDEN RULES OF WRONGNESS 
WERE REFINED AND HANDED DOWN BY IDIOTS FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION 
UNTIL EVERYONE KNEW EXACTLY HOW TO DO WRONG RIGHT 
A BIT OF MODERN ART 
ALWAYS GOES DOWN VERY BADLY 
MAKE SPORTSMEN SING 
COS THINGS ARE GONNA BE JUST FINE IF YOU ONLY WILL IT 
GET POSH PEOPLE TO TALK TO THE GREAT UNWASHED 
PERSUADE SOME LOONY HIPPY TO EAT THEIR OWN PLACENTA ON NATIONAL T. V. 
THE PLACENTA'S 
GONNA BE COOKED AND MADE INTO A PLACENTA PATE 
AND I'M NOT SURE QUITE WHAT THE RECIPE IS FOR THAT 
PONTIFICATING AS WE ALL DO 
IF ALL ELSE FAILS GIVE YOUR TALKSHOW GUESTS LOTS OF BOOZE 
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE 
HERE'S OLIVER REED MAKING HIS LEGENDARY APPEARANCE 
ON CHANNEL FOUR'S LIVE LATE NIGHT DISCUSSION SHOW 
PEOPLE ALWAYS REMEMBER HIM NOT MAKING MUCH SENSE 
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE FOOTAGE HE'S MAKING PERFECT SENSE LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION 
WHY SHOULD YOU FORGIVE 
YOURSELF BECAUSE A BOY 
FALLS BEFORE YOU 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND 
IDIOT HE SAID WHY SHOULD YOU FORGIVE YOURSELF 
WHEN A BOY FALLS BEFORE YOU 
WHAT'S SO COMPLICATED ABOUT THAT IF SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS NO ILL 
REALLY COMES TO A PALAIS DE DANCE AND DANCES AROUND THE PLACE 
WHO IS 
TICKLES 
HIS HEELS IN THE AIR BECAUSE HE'S 
A CELT 
WHY SHOULD HE GO DOWN 
AND HOW DO YOU FORGIVE YOURSELF BECAUSE HE'S A BETTER DANCER 
WHAT HE'S SAYING IS 
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION 
WHY SHOULD HE SHOULD YOU FORGIVE YOURSELF NOBODY'S ASKING THESE QUESTIONS 
THIS IS BETTER THAN PLATO 
EFFECTIVELY IT WAS THE BLOCKADE 
AND THEN IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES OH YEAH YOU'RE ALL BLOODY GENERALS EH 
YOU'RE ALL SO BLOODY SMART THAT THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GONNA MOVE YOUR TANKS AROUND AND THEN 
THAT IS ACTUALLY A VERY INCISIVE 
ANALYSIS OF MODERN WARFARE TACTICALLY 
HE'S UP TO THE MARK 
I FOR ONE WOULD LOVE TO SEE HIM IN A BATTLEFIELD SITUATION 
IF HE WAS STILL ALIVE WHY NOT I MEAN IT'S A WASTE 
WE ARE DEFINING 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALL YOUR ATTITUDES 
WHEN WE COME DOWN THERE WITH THE WOOLLY OLD SMOKEY BLOWY ON THE 
COME OFF ON THE BIG OLD BIKES AND GO DOWN THERE AND SAY WHAT ARE WE WAY SUNSHINE 
BUT THAT'S MACHO BUT OLIVER YOU DON'T REALLY 
HERE'S WHERE WE COME THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GONNA GO 
YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE THAT 
THAT'S WHERE WE CAME SUNSHINE THAT'S WHERE THE WIDGES THE WIDGES AND THE WOMEN ALL GO OOH 
ON THE BIG OLD CHOPPER AND WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN THERE LADS 
AND HERE AGAIN WE SEE A FAILURE TO CORRECTLY INTERPRET OLIVER'S ARGUMENT 
WHICH TO SUMMARISE IS BASICALLY YOU'RE ALL TALKING BOLLOCKS AND I'M NOT 
WHAT TIME IS IT NOW IT'S ALMOST ALMOST ALMOST TIME TWENTY TO ONE NEARLY 
I WON'T TALK TILL ONE O'CLOCK 
AND LET'S SEE HOW YOU LOT GO ON AND WHO REMEMBERS 
WHAT THEY WERE SAYING WHEN OLLY WITHHELD HIS WISDOM 
NO ONE NOT ONE WORD I REST MY CASE 
A TALK SHOW HAS ALL THE RIGHT CONDITIONS 
FOR A FULL ON T. V. DISASTER 
EGOS LIKE BARRAGE BALLOONS 
A SHORTAGE OF GUESTS WHO'VE GOT ANYTHING WORTH SAYING 
AND GALLONS OF BOOZE IN THE GREEN ROOM 
AS TRACY EMIN SO MEMORABLY SAID GO FUUUU IN THE FU AHH 
AND THE PAINTINGS CHANGE AS ONE DOES THAT 
AMAZINGLY TRACY EMIN CAME OUT OF THIS DISPLAY 
QUITE WELL ARE REALLY REAL PEOPLE 
IN ENGLAND WATCHING THIS PROGRAMME NOW ARE THEY REALLY WATCHING IT 
REAL PEOPLE WATCHING THIS PROGRAMME 
WHY ARE YOU ASKING THAT QUESTION THEY'RE AS REAL AS YOU ARE TRACY 
THEY'RE JUST TWENTY FIVE MINUTES BEHIND US THINK ABOUT THAT 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE'S SO UPSET ABOUT 
IT SEEMS TO BE PEOPLE DISCUSSING ART IN SUITS 
IS THAT WRONG 
AND WHAT ARE REAL PEOPLE 
IF THEY AREN'T REAL THEY MUST BE THE MOST ARTICULATE ROBOTS EVER BUILT 
HOW MANY ARTISTS ARE HERE FROM THAT SHOW 
I'M HERE 
I'M DRUNK I HAD A GOOD NIGHT OUT WITH MY FRIENDS I'M LEAVING NOW 
I WANT TO BE WITH MY FRIENDS I WANT TO BE WITH MY MUM 
I'M GONNA PHONE HER AND SHE'S GONNA BE EMBARRASSED ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION 
THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT TRACY SAID YES TO JOINING AN ARTS DISCUSSION 
AND YES TO BOOZE AND SHE SHOULD'VE SAID NO TO ONE OF THEM 
YOU AREN'T RELATING TO ME NOW YOU'VE LOST ME 
YOU'VE LOST ME COMPLETELY DO YOU THINK IT'S A GENERATIONAL THING

THEY'RE NOT GONNA ENFORCE IT 
I KNOW LOTS OF PUBS OVER IN IRELAND AND LIKE

THERE'S A GREAT EPISODE OF MR. BENN WHERE HE PUTS ON A SHANE MACGOWAN OUTFIT 
AND SPENDS AN AFTERNOON SHOUTING AT PIGEONS 
AND COMBING HIS HAIR WITH A SHOE 
THEY DON'T WANT TO LOSE THEIR JOBS BECAUSE 
BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL STOP USING A PUB WHERE THEY CAN'T SMOKE 
WHAT I'M SAYING IS LIKE IN THE CITY IN IRELAND 
AND SOME TOWNS WHATEVER YEAH 
THIS WAS RECORDED DURING LENT WHEN SHANE WAS ON A VERB FAST 
WHEN THEY BROUGHT THIS IN IN NEW YORK BUSINESSES DIDN'T GO BUST 
BARS DID STAY OPEN YEAH AND THEY HAD A WAR WITH IRAQ YOU KNOW 
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN CORRELATE SMOKING WITH 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BUT LIKE AND UM 
YOU THINK YOU'RE CHANGING THE WORLD BUT YOU'RE NOT 
YOU'RE MAKING A JOKE NO ONE'S ASKING US TO CHANGE THE WORLD 
HE'S GOT VINDALOO ON HIS SHOULDER 
HOLD IT HOLD IT THAT'S THE BEST GAG

ORBITAL SECTION NUMBER TWO 
YOU GO INTO A TRANCE AND THE VOICE SPEAKS THROUGH YOU THAT RIGHT

WITH THE INTELLIGENCE FROM ANOTHER PLANET 
AND HE CONVEYS HIS MESSAGE THROUGH ME 
USING YOUR VOCAL CORDS YES OH YES 
COULD YOU DO THAT THIS EVENING 
I THINK I COULD YES 
THAT'S LUCKY 
HE NEEDS TO WEAR SUNGLASSES BECAUSE THE VENUSIANS 
WILL ONLY HANG OUT WITH COOL CATS

TO GET PUNCHED IN GLASSES 
WHICH HE OBVIOUSLY WANTS TO DO 
GOOD EVENING GOOD EVENING

I'D LIKE TO DO A SHOW TO HELP OLD PEOPLE KEEP FIT 
THEY'VE GOT A MONTH TO TONE UP OR WE PUT THEIR NAME ADDRESS AND HOUSE CONTENTS ON A LEAFLET 
WHICH IS CIRCULATED AROUND PRISONS THAT'LL GET 'EM MOVING 
AND A LITTLE CIRCLE INTO THE OTHER HAND

IF HE'D BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL WE'D HAVE LOADS OF CLIPS TO PUT IN THE SHOW 
THESE ARE NOT THE WORDS THAT I EXPECTED TO HEAR 
IT BECAME NUMBER ONE ON THE HINDUSTANI HIT PARADE 
AS SUNG BY THAT VERY FAMOUS BEAT GROUP THE KASHMEATLES 
BARON FREDERICK JAN FLORIS VAN PALLENDT WAS A DANISH EASY LISTENING ICON OF THE SIXTIES

THEY'VE HAD TO COME IN COS IT'S RAINING 
THERE'S EDDIE LARGE EYEING UP HIS LUNCH 
THE REASON THE GUESTS AREN'T DANCING IS 
THE CORRECT RESPONSE TO LIMAHL ISN'T DANCING IT'S LAUGHTER 
TROUBLE 
TROUBLE 
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE IN A PUB AND YOU'VE HAD FOUR OR FIVE PINTS AND YOU ANNOUNCE TO THE TABLE 
WHAT WOULD WE LOOK LIKE TO AN ALIEN IF THEY LANDED ON PLANET EARTH 
AND EVERYONE GOES YEAH WELL 
WELL IMAGINE YOU WENT STRAIGHT FROM THERE TO A MEETING AT THE B. B. C. 
AND THEY SAID BRILLIANT IDEA HERE'S THOUSANDS OF POUNDS 
I TRIED TO IMAGINE HOW MY WORLD WOULD APPEAR 
TO A VISITOR FROM ANOTHER PLANET 
I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT WITH FRESH EYES 
AND THEN I SUDDENLY REALISED I WAS BEING OBSERVED 
BY A TREE 
I WANTED TO LOOK CLOSELY AT THE TREE 
TO IMAGINE THAT I'D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT IN MY LIFE BEFORE 
BUT I HAD 
COULD I BELIEVE AS MY ALIEN MIGHT THAT IT WAS AN INTELLIGENT BEING 
TRY KICKING IT KICK IT CALL IT A TOSSER 
UNDERNEATH SEA THIS CREATURE IS ALL SMOOTH AND PALE 
IF I MET AN ALIEN I'D GET HIM TO TRY ON LOADS OF DIFFERENT HATS 
SEE HOW FUNNY HE LOOKED 
THIS SHOW WAS FORTY MINUTES LONG 
IMAGINE FORTY MINUTES OF THIS 
THERE IS A LOT MY PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR PLANET 
CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE ATMOSPHERE 
IF I WERE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD 
MY ALIEN WOULD REMAIN UNMOVED 
CAN YOU DRESS UP AS AN IMPERIAL GUARD 
FROM MANCHESTER WE BRING YOU THE UNIQUE MR. TONY MCCABE 
WHO CLAIMS HE CAN JUMP ON HEN'S EGGS AND HUMAN NOSES WITHOUT BREAKING THEM 
OH JUST TOO HIGH 
I SKIMMED THEM THEN 
MR. MCCABE I'M LOSING FAITH 
SHE'S BEING HARSH SHE DIDN'T REALLY THINK HE'D JUMP ON EGGS 
HERE'S A TIP 
IF SOMEONE SAYS THEY CAN JUMP ON EGGS JUST BELIEVE THEM TOO HIGH 
JUST GO YEAH I BELIEVE YOU NO YOU DON'T NEED TO SHOW ME 
I FELT IT CLICK THERE WE ARE 
THAT'S IT IS IT OH YES I FELT IT CLICK 
THAT'S THE JUMPING ON EGGS OH YES 
PLAY THE MUSIC OR BUILD A WALL 
WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK THEY WENT FOR 
IT'S THE WALL 
HANG ON HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN BUILDING THAT 
NOW THIS IS TELLY I'M BEING EDUCATED 
INFORMED AND ENTERTAINED 
FANTASTIC THEY SHOULD HAVE JUST STOPPED AFTER THIS 
AND NEVER MADE ANOTHER PROGRAMME AGAIN 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EARTH FROM THE LAND OF THE SHIRE 
LIVES A BRAVE LITTLE HOBBIT THAT WE ALL ADMIRE 
HERE'S A VULCAN SINGING ABOUT A HOBBIT 
AND IF THEY MATED YOU'D HAVE A SMARTARSE SHORT ARSE 
BILBO BILBO 
BILBO BAGGINS ONLY THREE FEET TALL 
BILBO BILBO BILBO BILBO BAGGINS 
THE BRAVEST LITTLE HOBBIT OF THEM ALL 
THE DANCERS ARE WEARING BADGES SAYING ADMIT LEONARD NIMOY TO THE UN 
THIS IS AN ELABORATE WAY OF SAYING YOU'VE LOST YOUR PASS JUST ASK ADMIN FOR A NEW ONE 
NOW HOBBITS ARE PEACE LOVIN' FOLKS YOU KNOW 
IT TELLS THE ENTIRE LORD OF THE RINGS STORY IN UNDER THREE MINUTES 
I CAN DO IT QUICKER THERE'S SOME ORCS AND THIS IS BOLLOCKS 
BUT ONE DAY BILBO WAS ASKED TO GO 
ON A BIG ADVENTURE 
MEN SAY THEY KNOW JUST WHAT WILL GO TO MAKE UP AN IDEAL WOMAN 
TALK ABOUT HAIR THE CLOTHES THAT YOU WEAR 
AS PART OF THE IDEAL WOMAN 
I WANT TO FIND A MAN 
WHO'LL TAKE ME AS I AM 
THIS SECTION COVERS A PERIOD IN HISTORY WHEN WOMEN'S SOCIAL STANDING WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY ABOVE CHIPS 
ACTING LIKE A STAR MIGHT MAKE THE IDEAL WOMAN 
I HOPE SHE'S GOOD AT SEX COS SHE CAN'T DANCE OR CLEAN 
WELCOME TO MAINLY FOR MEN 
AND THIS IS A PROGRAMME FELLAS JUST FOR YOU 
COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY FOR MEN SOME NEW INVENTIONS ON THE AUTOMOBILE 
AND THEN WE HAVE A VERY EXCITING PIECE ON SHARK FISHING 
AND A FEW DELECTABLE DAMSELS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE PLACE 
TAKE THIS ONE SHE'S A VERY FAMOUS LADY CALLED THE VENUS DE MILO 
A BIT PLUMP FOR ME BUT SHE HAD A FEW ROMANS GETTING HOT UNDER THE TOGA 
HE THINKS THE VENUS DE MILO IS A BIT FAT SHE'S HIGH MAINTENANCE TOO 
ESPECIALLY THE INSURANCE WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA 
IF WE ASKED FOUR EMINENT MEN ABOUT THE GIRL MOST LIKELY FOR THEM 
SOME WOMEN PHYSICALLY ARE MARVELLOUS WHEN THEY'RE LONG TALL AND SKINNY 
AND OTHERS WITH BIG TITS I MEAN THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF WOMEN 
I HAVE TO SORT OF FEEL THAT SOMEBODY WOULD BE INTERESTING 
IT'S LIKE AN IDEAL CAR 
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS AN IDEAL CAR COS A ROLLS ROYCE 
HAS GOT QUALITIES THAT A FERRARI DOESN'T 
AS DOES THE TRANSIT VAN AND THE POPE MOBILE 
THE WOMAN THAT TURNS MY HEAD 
HAS LONG HAIR 
LOOKS VAGUELY SORT OF ARTY 
UH 
AND WEARS INTERESTING SORT OF MATERIALS DARK YOU KNOW EXCITING 
NUN 
THE MORE TWEAKY THEY ARE THE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE TO GO WRONG LIKE FERRARIS 
I THINK HE DRIVES A FERRARI AS I AM 
I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU TONIGHT WITH SOMETHING SOOTHING AND COOL 
A GIRL AND A SONG AND WITH THEM BOTH I WISH YOU VERY PLEASANT DREAMS 
THAT'S NOT A GIRL THAT'S DAVID BECKHAM 
IF YOU IMAGINE THAT JIM HAS SOMEHOW MAGICALLY FOUND THE KEY 
TO THE FEMININE HEART YOU ARE WRONG 
IN FACT HE'S ONLY ONE OF A NUMBER OF HUSBANDS IN LINCOLNSHIRE 
WHO ARE PAMPERED AND FUSSED OVER BY THEIR DUTIFUL SPOUSES 
THE WIVES ARE ALL MEMBERS OF WHAT THEY CALL THE PUSSYCAT CLUB 
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE WOMEN MANAGING TO ORGANISE A CLUB 
AN ORGANISATION AIMED AT BANISHING FOREVER 
THE BELIEF THAT THE FEMALE IS IN ANY WAY EQUAL TO THE MALE 
OH I WISHED I'D LIVED IN THE SIXTIES 
HE'S MASCULINE COMPLETELY MALE 
YEAH I MEAN HE'S LIKE RAMBO 
AND THIS IS YOU KNOW HOW WE PERSONALLY THINK OF THIS' H. M. M. 
WHEN HE COMES HOME HE SHOULD BE LOOKED AFTER ABSOLUTELY 
TREATED NICE OH YEAH 
HE'S DONE HIS HARD DAY'S WORK SO HE'S ENTITLED TO COME HOME YEAH 
REALLY BE PAMPERED YUP YEAH 
YEAH THAT'S IT 
UH HUH 
BUT THE PUSSYCATS AREN'T ONLY CONCERNED WITH MATERIAL THINGS 
THEY LIKE TO EXPLORE ALL THE FACETS OF BEING A WOMAN 
THAT'S WHY THEY INCLUDE A COURSE ON THE GENTLE ART OF FLIRTING 
YOU LOOK AT YOUR POTENTIAL PARTNER 
FOR TWO TO THREE SECONDS 
YOU DROP YOUR EYES 
AND THEN YOU LOOK UP AGAIN SLIGHTLY UNDER THE LASHES 
WITH A FULL EXPRESSION AND HE WILL THEN ASK YOU TO DANCE 
THIS IS ONE STEP ON FROM DANGLING YOUR HAIR OUT OF A TOWER 
SO THIS IS WHAT MARRIED LIFE'S ALL ABOUT I MIGHT EVEN TRY IT MYSELF 
WINE 
HE REALLY THINKS THIS IS A GOOD IDEA 
H. M. M. CIGARETTE 
HE SHOULD BE USING A LOT MORE IRONY IN THIS SITUATION 
WOULD YOU MIND RUBBING MY SHOULDERS MY DEAR 
THAT'S NICE DON'T RING ME MIKE I'LL RING YOU 
BIT FURTHER OVER ON THE LEFT 
THIS IS WHAT INSPIRED MOST RAP VIDEOS 
SOMETHING ELSE TO LOOK FORWARD TO NOW IT'S OVER IN THE KITCHEN 
HELLO GOOD MORNING 
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE PANIC JUST BEFORE I CAME ON I FORGOT MY CAKE BASE 
HELLO FAITH BROWN WAS CRYOGENICALLY FROZEN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE 
DEFROSTED SOME TIME IN THE EIGHTIES 
AND TAKEN STRAIGHT TO A T. V. STUDIO WITHOUT TALKING TO A SINGLE PERSON 
ALL RIGHT O. K. 
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE 
YOU LIKE 
I LIKE DRESSING UP IN MY FINEST CLOTHES 
I CAN'T TALK EITHER 
THAT WAS REAL RUM THAT WAS REAL RUM 
SHE DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS GOING TO BE REAL 
PEOPLE GET VERY ANGRY ABOUT MODERN ART THEY SEE A PILE OF BRICKS 
THAT'S NOT ART A TENT WITH SOME NAMES IN A DEAD SHARK 
THAT'S NOT ART 
THIS IS USUALLY SAID BY PEOPLE WHOSE IDEA OF ART IS FOUND ON BIRTHDAY CARDS SHOWING A VINTAGE CAR 
WITH THE WORDS TO A WONDERFUL SON 
MICHELANGELO WOULD'VE DONE THAT IF HE'D HAD SOME ROPE AND A T. V. STUDIO 
BUT THE TROUBLE WAS ALL HE HAD TO WORK WITH WAS MARBLE PAINT AND THE SISTINE CHAPEL 
POOR SOD 
I HOPE HE GETS AN IMPORTANT PHONE CALL 
MICHAEL THIS PIECE WAS MADE FOUR YEARS AFTER LONG BOX 
IT'S CALLED OAK TREE OF COURSE 
AND IT'S A CELEBRATED PIECE THAT HOLDS OUT THE PROMISE OF SOMETHING THAT ISN'T THERE 
MINICAB DRIVERS ARE FUMING NOW 
IT'S NOT A TREE IT'S A GLASS IT'S A GLASS IT'S NOT A TREE 
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SHOUTING ISN'T IT 
YOU POURED SOME FRESH WATER INTO THAT GLASS WELL IT ONLY BECOMES AN OAK TREE WHEN I PUT THE WATER IN 
SO IN THAT SENSE BEFORE THAT IT WASN'T AN OAK TREE 
AND NOW IT DEFINITELY IS IT NEEDS CUTTING BACK 
WHAT WAS IT BEFORE IT WAS JUST A GLASS AND SOME WATER 
IT LOOKS SO LIKE A GLASS OF WATER ON A SHELF NOW IT DOES 
BUT AMAZINGLY IT IS IN FACT AN OAK TREE 
HANG ON ARE YOU SURE THAT'S NOT A BEECH 
MY MOTHER IS A LEG MY FATHER IS WEDNESDAY 
WE ARE A BUS 
I AM ART 
I LOVE ALL THAT 
IT REALLY MAKES YOU THINK 
THIS IS THE NORTHERN BALLET'S VERSION OF WAR OF THE WORLDS 
YOU SHOULD SEE THEIR VERSION OF GONE WITH THE WIND 
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME 
IT'S MOTHERCARE'S NEW FORMULA ONE TEAM 
THIS SHOWS YOU THAT DANCE IS A VERY IMPORTANT MEDIUM 
LIKE TEXTING 
THERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF THESE COLLECTIVES 
WHERE PREGNANT MECHANICS MEET UP AND CREATE CHALLENGING PIECES OF DANCE 
BUT HOW DO THEY GET UNDER THE CARS 
THIS IS AN AMAZING PIECE OF ART 
HE PUTS ALL THE CLIPPINGS IN AN ETCH A SKETCH 
AND DRAWS A CAT 
WHOEVER THOUGHT A MAN BEING SHAVED LIVE ON T. V. 
WAS A GOOD IDEA IT WASN'T 
IT WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA 
BUT THAT'S WHAT'S SO GOOD ABOUT IT 
THIS SHOW HAS BEEN PROOF THAT IN T. V. WRONG EQUALS RIGHT 
NONE OF THESE PROGRAMMES WAS MEANT TO BE TERRIBLE BUT THEY WERE 
AND THAT'S WHY WE REMEMBER THEM 
BEFORE WE GO THERE'S A FEW PEOPLE I'D LIKE TO THANK 
THE PRODUCER 
THE OTHERS HOW DO YOU DO THIS 
UM 
WELL 
PROBABLY PEOPLE WHO WATCH T. V. SHOWS 
DON'T KNOW WHY WE ACTORS AND ACTORS ALWAYS SAY A LOT OF THANK YOUS 
MAYBE IT SEEMS TO THEM THAT WE'RE JUST BEING POLITE 
BUT OF COURSE WE ALL HAVE TO 
OF COURSE OUR WRITER AND THAT'S MARTIN SHERMAN 
OUR DIRECTOR ROBERT ALLEN 
ALISON FISKE SHEILA KEITH AND JODIE SCOTT AND KEVIN ELLIOT 
AND ANDREW CHELLY AND MICHAEL SHALLARD 
LIZA MINNELLI 
OUR LIGHTING RON MARTIN 
AND OUR STAGE MANAGEMENT
