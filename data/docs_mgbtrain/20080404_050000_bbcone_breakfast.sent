GOOD MORNING IT IS FRIDAY FIFTH 
APRIL APRIL ALSO AHEAD THIS MORNING PROTECTING 
CHILDREN ONLINE NEW PROPOSALS TO 
STOP PAEDOPHILES FROM LOGGING ON 
NAOMI CAMPBELL IS RELEASED ON BAIL 
AFTER ALLEGEDLY ASSAULTING A POLICE 
OFFICER AT HEATHROW AIRPORT 
I'M SORRY IT IS MORE DOOM AND 
GLOOM FROM THE BUSINESS WORLD THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND SAYS IT IS ABOUT TO 
GET HARDER TO GET A MORTGAGE 
SOME SUNSHINE TODAY A LOVELY MILD 
DAY BUT FOR THE WEEKEND IT IS 
TURNING MUCH MUCH COLDER WITH SNOW 
YES SPRING MAY HAVE MAY HAVE 
SPRUNG BUT THERE IS A COLD SNAP ON 
THE WAY WE HAVE TIPS TO MAKE SURE 
YOUR GARDEN STILL GROWS 
GOOD MORNING 
IT IS ANOTHER CRUCIAL DAY FOR 
ZIMBABWE'S PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE 
WITH THE RESULTS OF THE DISPUTED 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DUE TO BE 
ANNOUNCED HE IS MEETING LEADERS OF 
HIS ZANU P. F. PARTY 
THE OPPOSITION FOR DEMOCRATIC 
CHANGE HAVE ACCUSED HIM OF 
UNLEASHING WAR AFTER ITS OFFICES 
WERE RAIDED 
HE MAY LOOK RELAXED AND CONFIDENT 
BUT ROBERT MUGABE FACES THE BIGGEST 
POLITICAL TEST OF HIS LIFE TODAY 
THE TOP BRASS OF HIS PARTY WILL 
MEET TO DISCUSS THEIR SURVIVAL 
STRATEGY STRATEGY FAR FROM LOOKING LIKE A LEADER ON 
THE WAY OUT HE SEEMS TO BE 
SPARRING FOR A FIGHT THIS DESPITE 
A PARTY DAMAGED IN THE 
PARLIAMENTARY IT VOTE 
THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE HAVE BEEN 
TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THIS 
ELECTION DRAMA THE OPPOSITION 
CLAIMS IT WON THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE 
THE STATE MEDIA CONCEDE IT WILL 
PROBABLY GO TO A SECOND ROUND 
OFFICIAL RESULTS ARE DUE OUT TODAY 
I WOULD HOPE THAT AGAIN EVERYBODY 
WOULD ACCEPT THOSE RESULTS IN THE 
WAY THOSE RESULTS HAVE BEEN 
ACCEPTED UP UNTIL NOW AND THEN THE 
LEGAL CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESSES OF 
ZIMBABWE WOULD THEN PROCEED 
VOTERS WILL BE WATCHING CLOSELY AS 
THE RULING PARTY SEARCHES FOR SOME 
COMMON GROUND INSIDERS CLAIMING 
THAT THE ZANU P. F. IS SPLIT SOME 
WANTING TO FIGHT IT OUT OTHERS 
LOOKING TO CUT A DEAL PEOPLE ARE 
NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT COULD COME NEXT 
BUT BELIEVE CHANGE IS AROUND THE 
CORNER CORNER ZIMBABWE'S STREETS ARE PACKED WITH 
QUEUES AND ALIVE WITH RUMOURS THAT 
AN OPPOSITION WIN COULD SEE WHITE 
FARMERS RETURN OR A PRESIDENTIAL 
RUN OFF COULD SIGNAL A TIGHTENING 
UP OF SECURITY ON THE STREETS 
STILL UNCERTAIN TIMES FOR A PEOPLE 
WHOSE FUTURE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PUT 
ON HOLD 
THE B. B. C. IS BANNED FROM ZIMBABWE 
OUR CORRESPONDENT GRANT FERRETT 
JOINS US FROM NEIGHBOURING SOUTH 
AFRICA AFRICA GOOD MORNING TO YOU GRANT THERE 
IS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THIS 
ELECTION RESULT 
BUT WHEN DO WE OFFICIALLY HEAR WHAT 
THE RESULT IS 
IF ONLY I KNEW THE ANSWER TO THAT 
OFFICIALLY IT SHOULD BE BY THE END 
OF THE DAY TODAY BUT I SHOULD ADD 
A WARNING TO THAT BEFORE WE GET 
THE PRESIDENTIAL RESULTS WE HAVE TO 
HAVE THE RESULTS FROM THE SENATE 
ELECTION AND SO FAR WE HAVE HAD TEN 
OUT OF SIXTY SO IT COULD BE EVEN 
BEYOND TODAY BUT WHAT WE THINK IS 
GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT THE MAIN 
DECISION MAKING BODY OF ZANU P. F. 
WILL MEET IN TWO HOURS TIME 
PRESIDENT MUGABE IS EXPECTED TO 
CHAIR THE MEETING AND ZANU P. F. WILL 
DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH THE RESULTS 
WHICH IT HAS BEFORE IT EVEN THOUGH 
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN MADE PUBLIC IT 
WILL DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT ROBERT 
MUGABE WANTS TO FIGHT A SECOND 
ROUND BECAUSE WE ASSUME HE DIDN'T 
GET OVER FIFTY PER CENT IN THE FIRST ROUND AT 
THE MOMENT THE INDICATIONS ARE THAT 
ROBERT MUGABE IS UP FOR FIGHTING A 
SECOND ROUND BALLOT 
MEAN MEANWHILE THE THE OPPOSITION 
ARE SAYING THE OPPOSITION HAVE 
UNLEASHED WAR ON THEM 
THERE WERE 
TWO SEPARATE INCIDENTS IN ONE 
MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES 
RAIDED OFFICES IN A HOTEL USED BY 
THE M. D. C. AND RAN RANSACKED THEM TWO 
JOURNALIST WERE DETAINED ON 
SUSPICION OF WORKING THESE ARE 
FOREIGN JOURNALISTS ON SUSPICION 
OF WORKING WITHOUT ACCREDITATION 
THE M. B. C. SAYS THIS IS A BEGINNING OF 
A REPEAT OF THE TACTICS WHICH THE 
ZIMBABWE USED IN THE PAST DURING 
ELECTION NAMELY INTIMIDATION AND 
VIOLENCE AND IF THERE IS A SECOND 
ROUND IT IS LIKELY THERE WILL BE 
VIE VIOLENCE IN ZIMBABWE WHILE 
ROBERT MUGABE TRIES TO CLING ON TO 
TO POWER 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
PAEDOPHILES WHO DON'T INFORM THE 
POLICE OF THEIR E. MAIL ADDRESSES 
COULD FACE FIVE YEARS IN PRISON 
ACCORDING TO NEW GOVERNMENT PROPOSE 
AST THE HOME OFFICE SAYS IT WANTS 
TO BAN CONVICTED CHILD SEX 
OFFENDERS FROM LOGGING ON TO SOCIAL 
NETWORKING SITESMENT 
HERE IS SOPHIE HUTCHINSON 
THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO MAKE IT 
HARDER FOR SEX OFFENDERS TO GROOM 
CHILDREN ONLINE IT IS CONCERNED 
THAT SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES WHERE 
MILLIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLE SHARE 
PERSONAL INFORMATION ARE NOT AN 
EASY TARGET FOR PAEDOPHILES 
THERE IS A BILL GOING THROUGH 
PARLIAMENT WHICH WILL GIVE US THE 
POWER TO CHANGE THE NOTIFICATION 
REQUIREMENTS FOR SEX OFFENDERS AND 
WHEN WE HAVE THAT POWER WE WILL 
REQUIRE THOSE PEOPLE TO NOTIFY 
SUBJECT TO THE SEX OFFENDER 
REQUIREMENTS TO NOTIFY THEIR E. MAIL 
ADDRESSES ADDRESSES FAILURE TO DO SO WILL CARRY FIVE 
YEAR PRISON SENTENCE ATE DRESSES 
WILL BE SENT TO WEBSITE OPERATORS 
WHO WILL BE EXPECT TODAY MONTHOR OR 
BLOCK THEM WITH SOCIAL NETWORKING 
SITES A NEW E. MAIL ADDRESS IS EASY 
TO ACQUIRE SOME ARE QUESTIONING 
WHETHER THE NEW RULES WILL WORK 
THE INTERNET CHANGES RAPIDLY AND I 
BELIEVE THAT WE'RE MOVING AWAY FROM 
E. MAIL ADDRESS AS THE SOUL HOOK 
THAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO REGISTER 
FOR THESE SITES THERE ARE SITES 
TODAY THAT ALLOW CHILDREN TO PLAY 
GAMES WITH EACH OTHER ACROSS THE 
WORLD AND WITH STRANGERS THAT DON'T 
REQUIRE AN E. MAIL ADDRESS THE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS WORKING OUT 
THE DETAIL ON HOW THE NEW RULE WILL 
OPERATE BUT IT IS HOPING THOUSANDS 
OF CHILD SEX OFFENDERS WILL BE 
BARRED FROM USING SOCIAL NETWORKING 
SITES

TROPICAL DOWNPOURS THAT SORT OF 
WEATHER WHAT IS THIS ABOUT

SAYING IT WILL BE A TYPICAL SUMMER 
THERE'LL BE DAYS THAT ARE WARMER

OF THE EXCEPTIONAL RAIN FALL WE HAD 
LAST SUMMER THE PROBLEMS WE ARE 
LOOKING AT THIS SUMMER IS PRETTY 
LOW L. WOULD NOT USE THE WORD

ARRIVING FOR WORK HIS RESTAURANT 
ONLY OPENS FOR EIGHT MONTHS OF THE 
YEAR SO AS THE SEASON KICKS OFF 
HIS FIRST CHALLENGE IS TO TRAIN UP 
HIS NEW TEAM OF STAFF 
WHAT I 
RECOMMEND IS YOU HAVE THE CHUTNEY 
APPLE THE BEGINNING OF THE 
SEASON FOR ME IS OBVIOUSLY PRESSURE 
WE HAVE NEW STAFF ARRIVING THREE 
FROM LAST YEAR IT MEANS GETTING 
THE GUYS TRAINED UP GETTING THEM 
TO UNDERSTAND THE ISLAND NOT ONLY 
THE FOOD BUT THE HOTEL THE WASTE 
DISPOSAL EVERYTHING ELSE THAT GOES 
WITH IT SO CONSTANT TRAINING IT 
DOES MEAN A LOT OF PRESSURE BUT 
THAT IS WHAT WE GET PAID TO DO 
KENNY'S WAS ONE OF FIFTEEN NEW MICHELIN 
STARS AWARDED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NOW HE IS 
UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE TO KEEP IT 
IT IS NOT THERE FOR LIFE THEY CAN 
TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU ON A 
BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW IT IS GREAT 
PUBLICITY EVERYONE WANTS TO EAT 
HERE AND WORK HERE TO LOSE IT IS 
AS DRAMATIC 
WHEN HE TOOK OVER THIS 
RESTAURANT TWO YEARS AGO HE MOVED 
HIS FAMILY FROM THE MIDLANDS TO SAINT 
MARTINS HE SAYS OVERALL HIS 
QUALITY OF LIFE HAS IMPROVED DAY 
TO DAY HE IS STILL WORKING HARD 
AND HAVING A KITCHEN TWENTY EIGHT MILES OFF

THE BOSS OF ONE OF BRITAIN'S 
BIGGEST INTERNET PROVIDERS ATTACKED 
THE MUSIC INDUSTRY FOR DEMANDING 
THAT HIS COMPANY TAKES ACTION 
AGAINST PEOPLE WHO DOWNLOAD MUSIC 
AND INFORMATION WITHOUT PERMISSION 
CHARLES DUNSTONE SAYS IT IS 
UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT HIM TO CUT 
OFF PEOPLE WHO SHARE FILES 
A MARRIED MAN WHO USED TO BE A 
WOMAN HAS APPEARED ON TELEVISION 
IN AMERICA TO TALK TALK ABOUT HIS 
PREGNANCY HE TOLD THE THE OPRAH 
WINFREY SHOW THAT BEING A MAN AND 
HAVING A BABY WASN'T A PROBLEM 
YOU KNOW I HAVE A VERY STABLE MALE 
GENDER IDENTITY 
I SEE PREGNANCY AS A PROCESS AND IT 
DOESN'T DEFINE WHO I AM 
I GOT THAT YEAH 
O. K. GOT IT 
YEAH YEAH SO WHEN YOU DECIDED YOU KEPT YOUR 
RO PO DUCTIVE ORGANS BECAUSE YOU 
THOUGHT MAYBE ONE DAY I WILL NEED 
THEM 
IT IS NOT A MALE OR FEMALE THEM DESIRE TO WANT TO HAVE A CHILD IT 
IS A HUMAN DESIRE L. AM A PERSON 
AND I HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE MY OWN 
BIOLOGICAL CHILD 
THAT STORY JUST 
TAKES SO MUCH GETTING YOUR HEAD 
AROUND IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS 
BUT HE WAS BORN WOMAN THAT IS 
THE KEY FACT BORN A WOMAN AND KEPT 
THE ABILITY TO HAVE CHILDREN 
COMING UP 
NO LEASH NO KENNEL AND NO ONE TO 
CATCH THEM WE WILL LOOK AT WHETHER 
CHANGES IN THE LAW COULD MEAN MORE 
STRAY DOGS ROAMING OUR STREETS 
WHEN COMPANIES KILL ARE THE NEW 
LAWS ON CORPORATE MANSLAUGHTER 
TOUGH ENOUGH TO PROTECT WORKERS

HIS OWN OWN COACHING STAFF AND 
COMPLETE CONTROL AND THAT MAYBE THE 
STUMBLING BLOCK SO SO FAR WE KNOW 
HE IS INTERESTED THIS IS PROBABLY 
THE ONLY JOB THAT COULD GET HIM 
BACK INTO RUGBY AS FAR AS MANY OF 
US CONSIDER IT IS LOONING WAY TO 
GO LONG WAY TO GO HE TOTALLY 
WOULD CLEAR OUT THE COACHING STAFF 
AND BRING HIS OWN MEN 
IF P. R. TERMS IN TERMS OF ENGLAND 
RUGBY THEY COULDN'T NOT LET IT 
HAPPEN NOW 
NO WHO IS THE MAN THAT 
COULD TAKE US FORWARD AND IT IS

RISING MORTGAGE PAYMENTS ARE 
ACCOUNTING FOR UP TO THREE QUARTERS 
OF FAMILIES DISPOSABLE INCOME THAT 
MEANS AN INCREASING NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE COULD LOSE THEIR HOMES 
THAT'S THE MESSAGE FROM THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS THIS MORNING THEIR 
RESEARCH SUGGESTS SIXTY THOUSAND FAMILIES 
ARE AT RISK OF RO POSSESSION 
REPOSSESSION 
JULIA GOLDSWORTHY JOINS US THIS 
MORNING MORNING GOOD MORNING TO YOU 
GOOD MORNING 
THE FIGURES SOUND ALARMING 
IT IS 
TERRIFYING AND THAT'S DOUBLE THE 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE 
REPOSSESSED LAST YEAR THESE ARE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING HOME LESS 
THAN ONE THOUSAND AND ARE SPENDING THREE 
QUARTERS OF THAT ALREADY ON THEIR 
MORTGAGE PAYMENTS THESE ARE THE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE AT THE HIGHEST RISK 
OF FACING DIFFICULTIES IN THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH THAT WE'RE SEEING 
THIS YEAR IF THEY ARE LOOKING TO 
REMORTGAGE AND LOOKING TO MOVE OFF 
A LOW FIXED RATE THEY WILL BE 
STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET 
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO 
ARE FACING THE PROBLEMS AND THAT'S 
PRIOR TO THE INCREASES AND THE 
MORTGAGES PAYMENTS THAT THEY WILL 
FACE COMING UP SHORTLY 
THAT MANY MAYBE SEEING YES IT IS 
ONE INDICATOR THAT SHOWS THAT 
THINGS COULD BE GETTING DIFFICULT 
THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO 
WILL BE FACING MOVING OFF THE LOW 
INTEREST RATES THESE ARE THE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY STRETCHED TO 
THE LIMIT AND WHO ARE GOING TO BE 
FINDING IT DIFFICULT IF THEY DO 
MOVE TO MOVE ON TO ANOTHER 
COMPETITIVE RATE 
THERE WILL BE PEOPLE OUT THERE 
SAYING YOU ARE STATING THE OBVIOUS 
MOST PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES KNOW 
THINGS ARE GETTING SQUEEZED AND 
EVERYONE IS IS HAVING TO MAKE THEIR 
OWN DECISION ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE 
THEY ARE SPENDING THEIR MONEY ON 
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO ACHIEVE BY 
HIGHLIGHTING THIS 
THERE ARE 
ALREADY MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE 
STRETCHED WE ARE LOOKING AT A TIME 
WHEN COUNCIL TAX HAS GONE UP BY FIVE PER CENT 
ENERGY BILLS ARE GOING UP BY FIVE PER CENT WE 
ARE JUST HIGHLIGHTING THE PRESSURES 
THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE UNDER AND 
HIGHLIGHTING THE FACT THAT THE 
SUPPORT ISN'T THERE FOR PEOPLE NOW 
THAT WAS THERE IN THE LAST HOUSING 
MARKET DIFFICULTIES IN THE EARLY 
NINETIES THEN YOU COULD GET INCOME 
SUPPORT FOR YOUR MORTGAGE INTEREST 
PAYMENTS THAT'S NOT THERE ANYMORE 
WE HAVE GOT WAITING LISTS GOING 
UPMENT WE HAVE LESS SOCIAL HOUSING 
THERE ARE THINGS THE GOVERNMENT 
COULD BE DOING TO TRY AND KIND OF 
PRE EMPT SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES 
THAT THESE PEOPLE MIGHT BE FACING 
YOU ARE TYING THIS IN CLOSELY WITH 
MORTGAGE REPAYMENTS ON THIS ISSUE 
THAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE DONE TO 
KEEP THE MORTGAGE RATES LOW THE 
BANKS AND THE BUILDING SOCIETIES 
RUN A BUSINESS IF THEY CAN CHARGE 
HIGHER INTEREST RATES THEY WILL DO 
THAT THAT WON'T CHANGE IS IT WE WE ARE SAYING THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS 
THAT COULD BE DONE THERE ARE PATHS 
THAT COULD BE TAKEN THAT WOULD MEAN 
PEOPLE AT RISK OF REPOSSESSION 
DON'T FACE THAT THE BANKING CODE 
SAYS THAT BANKS SHOULD RENEGOTIATE 
THE TERMS OF THEIR LOAN THERE IS 
NO REQUIREMENT FOR THEM TO DO 
THATMENT WE ARE SAYING THAT SHOULD 
BE MADE ON A STATUTORY BASIS AND 
ANYONE FACING DIFFICULTIES SHOULD 
HAVE ACCESS TO INDEPENDENT 
FINANCIAL ADVICE PERHAPS THE BANKS 
SHOULD BE LOOKING TO OFFER THE 
PROPERTY ON PART OWNERSHIP BASIS 
RATHER THAN TAKING REPOSSESSION AS 
THE FIRST STEP 
THANK YOU 
IT IS LIKELY WE'RE IN FOR A COLD 
WEEKEND WEEKEND CAROL I HEARD RUMOURS OF KNOW IS 
THAT TRUE SNOW IS THAT TRUE 
SPOT ON THIS WEEKEND WILL BE 
COLDER COLDER WE HAD REPORTS YESTERDAY THAT SOME 
PLACES HIT NINETEEN CELSIUS AND SOME 
PLACES TWENTY CELSIUS BUT THIS WEEKEND 
THEY ARE GOING TO BE DONE 
YOU CAN SEE THE AMOUNT OF CLOUD 
SPILLING ACROSS THE BRITISH ISLES 
THAT'S PRODUCING RAIN BUT IT WILL 
BE THICK ENOUGH HERE AND THERE FOR 
THE ODD SHOWER AND ALSO SOME 
DRIZZLE DRIZZLE THE PICTURE WE ARE LOOKING AT NOW 
IS NINE A M. THIS MORNING THERE IS A BIT 
OF MIST AND FOG AROUND BY NINE A M. 
MOST OF IT SHOULD OF GONE AND THERE 
WILL BE A LOT OF CLOUD LEFT IN ITS 
WAKE WAKE MOVING UP ACROSS THE NORTH OF 
ENGLAND AGAIN A LOT OF CLOUD WITH 
BREAKS IN THE EAST AND THE RAIN 
ACROSS THE FAR NORTH OF SCOTLAND BY 
NINE A M. WILL BE TO CONTINUING TO 
JOURNEY IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
SCOTLAND AND FRINGING INTO NORTHERN 
IRELAND BUT IT WILL BE LIGHTER AND 
MORE PATCHY IN NATURE AS IT PUSHES 
SOUTH SOUTH FOR WALES THIS MORNING AGAIN QUITE 
A LOT OF CLOUD AROUND 
SOME OF THAT PRODUCING DRIZZLE A 
LOT OF MURK AND MEST MIST AND FOG 
AROUND THE BRISTOL CHANNEL AND THE 
SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND BUT LIKE THE 
SOUTH EAST THAT WILL LIFT AS WE GO 
THROUGH THE MORNING HOWEVER CLOSE 
TO WINDWARD COASTS LOW LOUD IS 
LIKELY TO PREVAIL THERE WILL BE 
BREAKS IN THE CLOUD AND WE WILL SEE 
SUNSHINE AND TEMPERATURES AS HIGH 
AS EIGHTEEN CELSIUS 
NOW THROUGH THIS EVENING AND 
OVERNIGHT THE RAIN BAND VERY WEAK 
IN NATURE CONTINUES TO PUSH DOWN 
TOWARDS THE SOUTHMENT A NEW ONE 
COMES IN FOLLOWED BY COLDER AIR 
ACROSS SCOTLAND LATER TONNE AND 
TOMORROW WE WILL HAVE SNOW 
ESPECIALLY TO HIGHER GROUND AND YOU 
CAN SEE HOW THE COLD AIR PENETRATES 
DOWN TOWARDS THE MIDLANDS WITH 
WINTRY SHOWERS AS WELLMENT 
IT WILL BE WINDY OVERNIGHT 
SATURDAY INTO SUN BLIZZARDS ACROSS 
SCOTLAND AND BY SUNDAY IT WILL 
FEEL MUCH COLDER AND AGAIN WE ARE 
LOOKING AT SNOW SHOWERS ALMOST 
ANYWHERE IF YOU ARE TRAVELLING 
BEAR THAT IN MIND 
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU FOUND A 
STRAY DOG WANDERING AROUND YOUR 
NEIGHBOURHOOD YOU MIGHT CONSIDER 
CALLING THE POLICE HOWEVER THAT'S 
GOING TO STOP BEING AN OPTION FROM 
SUNDAY IT WILL BE UP TO EVERY 
LOCAL AUTHORITY IN ENGLAND AND 
WALES TO PROVIDE AN OUT OF HOURS 
SERVICE TO ROUND UP THE STRAYS 
WITH US NOW IS CLARISSA BALDWIN AND 
CAR LEAN HOOK 
CAROLINE HOOK 
WHAT IS THIS CHANGE IN THE RULES A 
SIMPLE CALL TO THE POLICE IS THE 
USUAL STANDARD RESPONSE 
THE POLICE 
HAVE ADVOCATED THEIR RESPONSIBILITY 
AND PASSED IT ON TO LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES WHICH IS FINE UP TO A 
POINT BUT THEY HAVE GIVEN THEM 
WOOFULLY INADEQUATE MONEY TO RUN 
THE SERVICE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN 
DAYS A WEEK 
YOU MIGHT WALK DOWN 
THE STREET AT EIGHT HUNDRED P. M. YOU MIGHT SEE 
SOME DOGS RUNNING WILD WHAT WOULD 
HAPPEN PREVIOUSLY 
YOU WOULD CALL 
THE POLICE THEY WOULD PROBABLY 
LEAVE THEM BUT THEY MIGHT COLLECT 
THEM PARTICULARLY IF THEY WERE 
DANGEROUS DOGS FORTUNATELY YOU 
DON'T SEE PACKS OF ROAMING DOGS 
THEY ARE QUITE HIDDEN WHAT I THINK 
IS GOING TO HAPPEN L. DON'T THINK 
THERE'LL BE MORE STRAYS ON THE 
STREET BUT WHAT I THINK WILL 
HAPPEN IS THEY WILL BE MORE VISIBLE 
BECAUSE THEY WILL BE ON THE STREETS 
FOR LONGER UNTIL PEOPLE CAN DECIDE 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM THIS IS A 
HUGE MISH MASH OF IDEAS LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES ARE NOT PUTTING INTO 
PLACE 
CAROLINE WHAT IS SAFFY'S PLACE STORY 
SAFFY WAS HANDED IN AT TWELVE STORY WEEKS SHE WAS HANDED INTO THE DOGS 
TRUST WEST LONDON REHOOMING CENTRE 
AS YOU CAN SEE SHE IS A LIVELY 
YOUNG LASS SHE HAS JUST CELEBRATED 
HER FIRST BIRTHDAY 
WHAT I AM 
TRYING TO GET CLEAR IS HOW MUCH OF 
A PROBLEM THERE IS TO SOLVE HERE 
IF YOU SAY THE POLICE DON'T 
NORMALLY DO ANYTHING WHAT 
DIFFERENCE WILL IT MAKE 
THEY HAVE 
BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR STRAY DOGS 
POLICE STATIONS ARE OPEN TWENTY FOUR TO SEVEN 
THERE IS NO WAY THEY WILL DEAL WITH 
STRAY DOGS IN THE FUTURE WE 
SUGGEST RING YOUR POLICE STATION 
HOPEFULLY WILL THERE WILL BE JOINED 
UP THINKING BETWEEN THE LOCAL 
AUTHORITY AND THE POLICE AND THEY 
WILL KNOW WHAT THE PUBLIC SHOULD 
CALL IF THEY FIND A STRAY DOG DO DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THIS IS A PROBLEM 
THAT IS PARTICULARLY CONCENTRATED 
IN A CERTAIN AREA AROUND WHERE I 
LIVE YOU DON'T SEE STRAYS AMORE SO 
THE CURRENT SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE 
WORKING PRETTY WELL 
IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO SAY L. LIVE IN SURREY 
SO SAFFY'S BACKGROUND IS QUITE 
SKETCHY I SHOULD SAY WE ARE NOT 
ENTIRELY SURE OF THE FACTS IT DOES 
HAPPEN IN MOST AREAS 
THE PROBLEM 
LIES HERE WITH OWNERS DOGS BECOME 
STRAYS WHEN SOMEONE KICKS THEM OUT 
OF A HOME THAT IS WHERE THE 
PROBLEM LIES 
THERE ARE ACCIDENTS 
OBVIOUSLY YOU TEND TO WALK YOUR 
DOGS IN THE EVENINGS AND WEEKEND 
OFF THE LEAD GIVE THEM FREE RANGE 
AND THAT IS WHEN THEY TEND GOING 
MISSING T. NORTHEAST AND THE NORTH 
WEST OF ENGLAND HAVE A BIG PROBLEM 
SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOGS IN THAT AREA WHICH GO 
STRAY ABSOLUTELY RIGHT BACK TO 
RESPONSIBLE DOG OWNERSHIP ONLY GET 
A DOG IF YOU CAN LOOK AFTER IT 
PROPERLY GET IT MICROCHIPPED SO 
YOU CAN GET IT MORE EASILY BACK TO 
ITS OWNER 
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING 
IN SAFFY AND THANKS SAFFY YOU 
HAVE BEEN THE PERFECT GUEST VERY 
WELL BEHAVED 
YOU ARE WATCHING BREAKFAST OUR 
MAIN STORIES THIS MORNING ANOTHER

PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNMENT WILL 
STOP PAEDOPHILES LOGGING ON TO 
SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES

THIS MORNING HURRICANES DROUGHTS 
AND A SUB ZERO SPRING WHY THE 
GARDENERS' WORLD IS NOT WHAT IT 
USED TO BE 
A LOOK THROUGH THE FRONT PAGES OF 
THE PAPERS NOW A LOT OF INTEREST 
IN NAOMI CAMPBELL THE FRONT PAGE 
OF THE MIRROR SPITS IN COP'S 
FACE IS THE SUGGEST FROM THE DAILY 
IS THE SUGGESTION FROM THE DAILY 
MIRROR THE TRIAL MAKES THE FRONT 
OF THE METRO THIS MORNING THE 
EIGHT MEN ALLEGEDLY PLANNING TO 
SMUGGLE IN BOMB DEVISES HIDDEN IN 
FIZZY DRINKS AT HEATHROW TWO YEARS 
AGO THE COST OF GAS RIP OFGAS IS 
UP FORTY FIVE PER CENT THE STORY THERE IS OF 
COURSE OF KATE MOSS AND THE DAILY 
TELEGRAPH ALSO HAS THAT COURT STORY

GOOD MORNING AROUND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE 
WERE KILLED IN THE WORKPLACE IN 
BRITAIN LAST YEAR THOSE WERE THE 
WORST FIGURES FOR FIVE YEARS SO 
NEW LAWS ARE COMING IN THIS WEEKEND 
TO MAKE IT EASIER TO PROSECUTE 
COMPANIES FOR THINGS LIKE THAT 
PADDINGTON AND SO ON IT WILL MEAN 
HUGE FINES FOR SOME FIRMS 
EVER SINCE THE HER ROLD OF FREE 
ENTERPRISE SANK PROSECUTORS HAVE 
TRIED TO PROSECUTE COMPANIES AS 
WITH THE PADDINGTON TRAIN CRASH 
THEY WERE OBLIGED TO SHOW AN 
INDIVIDUAL WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
LARGE ORGANISATIONS LIKE A TRAIN 
COMPANY THAT TURNED OUT TO BE 
DIFFICULT THE NEW LAW FOR THE 
FIRST TIME STATUTORY WOULD BE VERY 
DIFFERENT NOW PROSECUTORS ONLY 
HAVE TO SHOW THAT A GROUP OF PEOPLE 
WERE AT FAULT O. OR A COMPANY HAD A 
POOR CULTURE OF SAFETY IN THEORY 
THAT SHOULD MAKE PROVING A CASE OF 
CORPORATE MAN SLAUGHTER IN THE 
COURTS EASIER THOSE WHO SURVIVED 
THE PADDINGTON CRASH WHICH KILLED 
THIRTY ONE PEOPLE CERTAINTY THIS SO 
RICHARD WAS BADLY BURNT IN THE 
ACCIDENT HE BELIEVES THE NEW LAW 
WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE 
WHAFRPBLTS IT DOES DO IS FIRMLY 
WHAT IT DOES DO IS FIRMLY PLACE ALL 
ORGANISATIONS WHICH NEED TO ADDRESS 
THE NEEDS OF THEIR CUSTOMERS TO 
MAKE SURE SAFETY RATHER THAN THE 
PROFIT MARGIN OR UNPROFITABILITY 
IS THE KEY DRIVER 
MANY BUSINESSES 
LIKE THOSE IN CONSTRUCTION ARE 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE LEVEL 
OF NEW FINES WHICH COULD BE AS 
HIGH AS TEN PER CENT OF A COMPANY'S TURNOVER 
THE INDUSTRY CLAIMS SOME BUSINESSES 
COULD EVEN BE FORCED TO CLOSE THAT THAT LEVEL OF FINE WILL BE HARMFUL TO 
THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IT 
OPERATES AT A LOW PROFIT MARGIN 
BETWEEN FIFTEEN TO TWO POINT FIVE PER CENT IF YOU IMPOSE 
THAT LEVEL OF TEN PER CENT CLEARLY THEN AN 
ORGANISATION COULD POTENTIALLY GO 
OUT OF BUSINESS 
AS A FORCEFUL 
ILLUSTRATION BALL FOR BEATY WAS 
FINED SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION AFTER THE 
HATFIELD CRASH IN TWO THOUSAND IF FOUND 
GUILTY OF CORPORATE MANSLAUGHTER 
NOW IT COULD FACE FINES ONE HUNDRED PER CENT LARGER 
THAN THAT IN AN HOUR'S TIME WE 
HAVE MORTGAGE ADVICE IF YOU ARE 
PLANNING TO REMORTGAGE OR GET YOUR 
FIRST MORTGAGE TRY AND TUNE IN FOR 
THAT THAT NOW SPRING HAS SPRUNG FLOWERS ARE 
IN FULL BLOOM THEY MIGHT NOT BE

FOREIGN JOURNALISTS ARRESTED 
OUR CORRESPONDENT JOINS US FROM THE

OFFICIAL NEWS WHAT WE ARE 
EXPECTING THERE WILL BE 
ANNOUNCEMENT THIS IS TO BE A RUN 
OFF BETWEEN MORGAN TSVANGIRAI AND 
PRESIDENT MUGABE 
AT THE MOMENT WE DON'T HAVE ANY 
OFFICIAL TIME WE HAVE NO OFFICIAL 
FIGURES BUT ALL THE SIGNS POINT TO 
THAT THE ZIMBABWE HERALD HAS BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT HOW WE ARE HEADING 
FOR A RUN OFF AND THE HERALD IS A 
STATE RUN NEWSPAPER THAT IS SCENE 
AS A SEEN AS GOOD REFLECTION AS 
THE WAY THE RULING PARTY AND THE 
GOVERNMENT ARE THINKING 
WHAT PRESSURE ARE THE OPPOSITION 
UNDER 
THE THE RAID LAST LAST NIGHT UNDER IS A GOOD INDICATOR OF THE PRESSURE 
THEY ARE UNDER AND THE WAY THIS 
NEXT ROUND OF CAMPAIGNING IF 
INDEED IT COMES TO PASS IS GOING 
TO HAPPEN AS YOU MENTIONED THEY 
HAD THE HOTEL THEY WERE BASED IN 
RAIDEDMENT TWO OF THE OFFICES THEY 
WERE WORKING IN WERE RAN RANSACKED 
NO M. D. C. OFFICIALS WERE THERE AT THE 
TIME THE M. D. C. SAYS THEIR LEADERS 
ARE IN A SAFE PLACE THEY ARE AT 
PAINS TO POINT OUT THAT THEY ARE 
NOT IN HIDING BUT AT THE SAME TIME 
THEY ARE FEELING THE PRESSURE FROM 
THE AUTHORITIES THEY ARE UNDER 
PRESSURE FROM THE ZANU P. F. THEY 
HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM OUTSIDE 
THE COUNTRY AND THERE IS A LOT OF 
DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE ON ROBERT 
MUGABE TO TRY AND MAKE MAKE SURE 
THIS NEXT ROUND IS PEACEFUL THAT 
THERE IS NO TROUBLE BUT IT IS NOW 
WE ARE ENTERING DIFFICULT TIMES FOR 
ZIMBABWE ZIMBABWE PETER GRESTE REPORTING FROM THE 
BORRER FOR US BORDER FOR US 
THANK YOU 
PAEDOPHILES WHO DON'T INFORM THE 
POLICE OF THEIR E. MAILS ADDRESS 
E. MAIL ADDRESSES COULD FACE FIVE 
YEARS IN PRISON 
THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO BAN 
PAEDOPHILES FROM LOGGING ON SOCIAL 
NETWORKING SITES SOPHIE HUTCHINSON 
REPORTS 
THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO MAKE IT 
HARDER FOR SEX OFFENDERS TO GROOM 
CHILDREN ONLINE IT IS CONCERNED 
THAT SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES WHERE 
MILLIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLE SHARE 
PERSONAL INFORMATION ARE NOT AN 
EASY TARGET FOR PAEDOPHILES 
THERE IS A BILL GOING THROUGH 
PARLIAMENT WHICH WILL GIVE US THE 
POWER TO CHANGE THE NOTE NOTE 
NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SEX 
OFFENDERS AND WHEN WE HAVE THAT 
POWER WE ARE ANNOUNCING OUR 
INTENTION THAT WE WILL REQUIRE 
THOSE PEOPLE TO NOTIFY SUBJECT TO 
THE SEX OFFENDER REQUIREMENTS TO 
NOTIFY THEIR E. MAIL ADDRESSES 
FAILURE TO DO SO WILL CARRY FIVE 
YEAR PRISON SENTENCE THE ADDRESSES 
WILL BE SENT TO WEBSITE OPERATORS 
WHO WILL BE EXPECTED TO MONITOR OR 
BLOCK THEM 
WITH WITH SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES 
LIKE THESE BASED ABROAD NEW E. 
MAIL ADDRESS IS EASY TO ACQUIRE 
SOME ARE QUESTIONING WHETHER THE 
NEW RULES WILL WORK 
THE INTERNET CHANGES RAPIDLY AND I 
BELIEVE THAT WE'RE MOVING AWAY FROM 
E. MAIL ADDRESS AS THE SOUL HOOK 
THAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO REGISTER 
FOR THE SITES THERE ARE SITES 
TODAY THAT ALLOW CHILDREN TO PLAY 
GAMES WITH EACH OTHER ACROSS THE 
WORLD AND WITH STRANGERS THAT 
DON'T REQUIRE AN E. MAIL ADDRESS TO 
REGISTER REGISTER THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS WORKING 
OUT THE DETAIL ON HOW THE NEW RULES 
WILL OPERATE BUT IT IS HOPING 
THOUSANDS OF CHILD SEX OFFENDERS 
WILL BE BARRED FROM USING SOCIAL 
NETWORKING SITES 
DETAILS OF EXPENSES CLAIMED BY

ROUNDING UP STRAYS OUT OF HOURS 
ON A PACK AND ON THE LOSE THIS IS 
WHAT THE DOG TRUST SAYS WE ARE 
LIKELY TO SEE MORE OF WHEN COUNCILS 
TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR STRAYS 
AT THE MOMENT THE POLICE PICK UP 
STRAYS AND BRING THEM TO KENNELS 
LIKE THESE OUT OF HOURS BUT 
THAT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE COUNCILS 
WILL BECOME SOLELY RESPONSIBLE BUT 
DOGS CHARITIES WARN THERE IS NOT 
ENOUGH FUNDING TO PAY FOR COUNCIL 
PROVISION THROUGH THE NIGHT AND 
THAT MEANS THE PUBLIC WILL BE ASKED 
TO PICK UP STRAYS THEMSELVES 
IT IS ONLY TRUE DOG LOVERS THAT

THAT BEING A MAN AND HAVING A BABY 
WASN'T A PROBLEM 
I HAVE VERY STABLE MALE GENDER IDENTITY IDENTITY I SEE PREGNANCY AS A PROCESS AND IT 
DOESN'T DEFINE WHO I AM 
I GOT THAT 
O. K. GOT IT 
YEAH YEAH SO YOU KEPT YOUR REPRODUCTIVE 
ORGANS BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT MAYBE 
ONE DAY I WILL NEED THEM 
YES I 
FEEL IT IS NOT A MALE OR FEMALE 
DESIRE TO HAVE A CHILD IT IS A 
HUMAN DESIRE I'M A PERSON AND I 
HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE MY OWN 
BIOLOGICAL CHILD 
HE WAS BORN A WOMAN 
HE WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS TO 
BECOME A MAN BUT HE HUNG ON TO HIS 
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS HE GOT MARRIED 
TO TO A WOMAN HIS WIFE CAN'T HAVE 
CHILDREN HE IS PREGNANT IT IS 
EXTRAORDINARY EXTRAORDINARY WHATEVER YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT IS 
EXTRAORDINARY EXTRAORDINARY AND THOSE ARE THE MAIN STORIES 
WE WILL BE TEACHING CAROL NEW MOVES 
WHERE IS SHE 
SHE IS DOING TAICHAI

CENTRED AND CALM

THE OLYMPIC FLAME IS ON ITS WAY TO 
LONDON BUT ITS JOURNEY ACROSS THE 
CAPITAL WON'T BE WITHOUT 
CONTROVERSY A NNL OF PLAN A 
NUMBER OF THE PLANNED TORCH BEARERS 
HAVE PULLED OUT OF THE RELAY 
THERE HAVE BEEN PROTESTS WHEN THE 
TORCH PASSED THROUGH ISTANBUL WHERE 
CHINESE MUSLIMS DEMONSTRATED 
AGAINST RELIGIOUS OPPRESSION WELL 
THE FORMER OLYMPIC SWIMMER DUNK 
DUNCAN GOODHEW IS ONE ATHLETE 
COMMITTED TO CARRYING THE TORCH ON 
SUNDAY HE WON GOLD AND BRANS AT 
THE MOSS BRONZE AT THE MOSCOW 
OLYMPICS HE JOINS US FROM OUR 
BRISTOL STUDIO 
GOOD MORNING TO YOU 
NOW YOU ARE TAKING PART IN THE 
RELAY HAVE YOU BEEN ASKING 
YOURSELF IF YOU SHOULD OR HAVE YOU 
BEEN COMMITTED THE WHOLE TIME I I THINK IT IS EASY FOR ME BECAUSE I 
HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS PROCESS 
BEFORE WHEN WE WENT TO MOSCOW AND 
RUSSIA WAS AT WAR WITH AFGHANISTAN 
TO MEET THE OLYMPIC GAMES IS 
SOMETHING THAT IS VERY SPECIAL IT 
IS FOR GOOD AS IT WERE IT IS ABOUT 
OUR PHYSICAL EXPRESSION AS HUMAN 
BEINGS IT IS ABOUT EQUITY FAIR 
PLAY AND THE THINGS THAT ARE 
REALLY GOOD IN HUMAN BEINGS 
AND YOU FEEL THAT THAT SPIRIT CAN 
TRANSCEND WHOEVER IS ORGANISING IT 
WHATEVER POLITICAL VIEWS PEOPLE MAY 
HAVE ABOUT CHINA 
I THINK IT IS 
POWER IN GOING TO THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
IT IS ABOUT BEING THERE WITH 
MILLIONS OF OTHERS HAVING A COMMON 
LANGUAGE A COMMON LANGUAGE OF 
SPORT AND THROUGH THAT OF COURSE 
IT IS ABOUT EXCELLENCE IT IS ABOUT 
FAIR PLAY IT IS ABOUT EQUITILY AND 
ALL THOSE THINGS THAT A GOOD 
DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM WANTS TO PUT 
ACROSS TO WHAT WOULD BE THE MIDDLE 
CLASS OF CHINA AND IN MY CASE BACK 
IN MOSCOW IT WAS THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE 
AND THROUGH THAT PROCESS YOU SEE A 
CHANGE AND IT IS ALMOST LIKE A 
CULTURAL AT OM BOMB ADDROPPING ON A 
COUNTRY AND IT HELTS MELTS AWAY 
THE RESERVES AND THE PROBLEMS WE 
HAVE IN IN SUSPICIONS OF OTHER 
CULTURES ETCETERA 
A NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO BE TAKING 
PART HAVE WITHDRAWN AND MANY OF 
THOSE WITHDRAWALS LINKED TO WHAT 
CHINA IS DOING IN TIBET THE 
COMEDIAN FRANCESCA MARTIN DECIDED 
NOT TO CARRY THE TORCH BECAUSE SHE 
FEELS SHE WOULD BE LEGITIMISING 
CHINA'S POSITION NOW WHAT DO YOU 
MAKE OF THAT 
WELL FIRST OF ALL 
YOU KNOW I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY 
TO THE OLYMPICS AND THE OLYMPIC 
GAMES AND THAT IS TO PROTECT IT FOR 
FUTURE GENERATIONS IT IS SUCH A 
SPECIAL THING THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE 
DAMAGED AT ALL SO I'M CLEAR ON 
THAT THAT AND I THINK SECONDLY THE TORCH 
RELAY IS ABOUT BRINGING THE OLYMPIC 
IDEALS TO BRITISH CHILDREN IT IS 
ABOUT INSPIRING THEM AND GIVING 
THEM ASPIRATIONS FOR THE FUTURE AND 
THEREFORE YOU KNOW BY BOYCOTTING 
OR NOT TAKING PART IN THAT TORCH 
RELAY IN FACT I THINK YOU ARE 
DAMAGING WHAT SOME OF THE GOOD 
SOME OF THE GOOD THAT COULD COME 
OUT OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES FOR OUR 
CHILDREN HERE IN THE U. K. L. DON'T 
SEE IT MAKES SENSE TO BOYCOTT IT 
AND FURTHERMORE WHAT DIFFERENCE 
WILL IT MAKE WILL IT CHANGE CHINA 
IT IS EASY FOR A POLITICIAN OR 
SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT GOING TO REALLY 
SUFFER FROM NOT TAKING PART IN 
SOMETHING TO SAY OH YES YOU WILL 
PAY THE PRICE DON'T YOU DO IT 
BUT AFTER ALL YOU KNOW YOU HAVE 
YOU HAVE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE REALLY DEDICATED THEMSELVES 
AND EVEN IF SAY EUROPE SAID 
DECIDED TO BOYCOTT THE COMPLETE 
OLYMPIC GAMES THERE WOULD STILL BE 
OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO HUNDRED SIXTY COUNTRIES TAKING PART 
SO IT WOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE 
DUNCAN GOODHEW THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WE HAVE ANOTHER OLYMPIC SWIMMER

ADRENALINE THAT FIGHT OR FLIGHT 
HOR MOAN THAT ADRENALINE RELEASE 
CAUSES INSULIN RESISTANCE WHICH 
STOPS IT GETTING THROUGH TO HELP 
CONTROL THE BLOOD GLUE COWES LEVELS

IS A LONG WAY FROM PLAYING 
GOING TO PLAY YET NO I THINK HE 
HOW DO YOU MAKE SOCIAL SOCIAL 
NETWORKING SITES OFF LIMITS TO 
PAEDOPHILES THE GOVERNMENT IS 
CONSIDERING OFFERING KITE MARKS TO 
SITES WHICH GUARANTEE TO BLOCK 
INAPPROPRIATE MATERIAL IT IS IT IS 
MEANT TO OFFER PARENTS PEACE OF 
MIND WHEN THEIR CHILDREN GO ON 
ONLINE ONLINE LET'S TALK TO ANNIE MULLIN AND EUAN 
SEMPLE SEMPLE GOOD MORNING TO YOU 
THIS IS QUITE COMPLEX ISSUE 
ANNIE WHAT'S THE REASONING BEHIND 
BLOCKING CERTAIN MATERIAL WHAT 
WHAT MATERIAL ARE WE TALKING ABOUT 
BLOCKING 
FIRSTLY THE TASKFORCE I BLOCKING HAVE BEEN LEADING WE HAVE LAUNCHED 
GUIDELINES FOR INDUSTRY WHICH HAS A 
A RANGE OF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM 
INCREASING THE SAFETY SETTINGS AND 
MAKE ARING SURE THEY ARE ON THE 
STRONGEST WHEN YOU SIGN UP FOR BEBO 
OR MY SPACE TO MAKE SURE THE SITES 
HAVE LOTS OF MATERIAL ABOUT 
EDUCATION FOR PARENTS AND CHILDREN 
AND THAT THIS IS THEY ARE ABLE TO 
SEE THIS ALL THE TIME AND THEY ARE 
ABLE TO REPORT ABUSE ANYTHING THAT 
IS HAPPENING TO THEM THAT WORRIES 
THEM EASILY TO PEOPLE LIKE NSPCC 
CHILDLINE OR COP 
THE THE RESULTS 
WOULD RESULT IN A KITE MARK THAT'S THAT'S SEPARATE AND THAT'S TO HELP PARENTS 
WITH THE FILLET FILTERING SOFTWARE 
THAT'S AVAILABLE AND THE B. S. I. WOULD 
GIVE THEIR KITE MARK TO SERVICES 
THEY TESTED AGAINST A RANGE OF 
CONDITIONS THAT THEY THINK THINK 
THESE SHOULD BE GOOD SOFTWARE 
SOLUTIONS AND THEY SHOULD REACH A 
CERTAIN STANDARD 
ON THE FACE OF IT THE IDEA IS THE 
GOVERNMENT KNOWS PAEDOPHILES E. MAIL 
ADDRESSES AND THEN WHEN THE 
PAEDOPHILES TRY AND GET ON TO THE 
WEBSITES THEY ARE BARRED 
WHAT IS TO STOP A PAEDOPHILE FROM 
COMING IN ON A DIFFERENT E. MAIL 
ADDRESS NOTHING ADDRESS NOTHING WITHOUT KNOWING MORE DETAILS ABOUT 
THE PROPOSALS AND WHAT TECHNICAL 
SOLUTIONS THEY MAY HAVE IT TAKES 
THIRTY SECONDS TO SET YOURSELF WITH A 
HOT MAIL ACCOUNT PEOPLE WHO ARE 
PREPARED TO BE CRIMINAL TO THE 
EXTENT OF BEING PAEDOPHILES WON'T 
BALK AT THE IDEA OF PRETENDING TO 
HAVE A FALSE E. MAIL ADDRESS 
IT IS A MASSIVE FLAW CONDITION 
SEE HOW IT WILL WORK 
THIS PROPOSAL ISN'T TO DO WITH 
MYSELF I WORK WITH VODAFONE AND 
I'M WITH THE INDUSTRY AND WE 
LEARNED ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY IT IS 
NEWS TO US WE ALL CARE VERY MUCH 
ABOUT CHILDREN AND WANT TO MAKE OUR 
SERVICES AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE AT 
THIS STAGE WE ARE HAPPY TO ENGAGE 
AND HAVE DIALOGUE WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT ABOUT IT 
THE THING IS THE GOVERNMENT IS 
CONCERNED ABOUT PAEDOPHILES 
ACCESSING CHILDREN AND PERSONAL 
INFORMATION GROOMING CHILDREN ON 
THE INTERNET THEY WANT TO DO 
SOMETHING THE TROUBLE IS LOFT 
PEOPLE SEE THE INTERNET AS A 
UNREGULATED WILD WEST 
SO IF BANNING CERTAIN E. MAILS IS 
NOT 
THE WAY FORWARD IS THERE WAY THE GOVERNMENT CAN INTERVENE OR 
INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS CAN STOP 
PAEDOPHILES GETTING ON TO THE NET 
PART OF THE PROBLEM IS PEOPLE 
EXPECTING THE GOVERNMENT TO SORT IT 
OUT AND TO MANAGE THE SITUATION FOR 
THEM AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'M 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE INTERNET IS 
PORTRAYED AS A SCARY PLACE PARENTS 
ARE WARY OF IT THEY GET 
CONDITIONED TO THING IT IS A 
DANGEROUS PLACE THE BUSINESSEST 
RISK THEY DON'T UNDERSTANDING IT 
AND ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT 
WHAT THE CHILDREN CONSIDER TO BE 
NORMAL I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS AND WE 
HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE THINGS 
THEY ARE DOING AND WHY THEY ARE 
DOING AND I KEEP WORK HARD TO KEEP 
UP AND UNDERSTAND THEM 
IF THE GOVERNMENT INTRODUCE A 
SYSTEM WHERE CERTAIN PAEDOPHILES E. 
MAILS ADDRESS WERE BANNED EVEN IF 
IT DIDN'T WORK ALL THE TIME THAT 
WOULD BE HELPFUL 
I DON'T THINK IT IS AN UNREGULATED 
PLACE THE CHALLENGE IS TO COME UP 
WITH REGULATIONS THAT MAKE SENSE 
AND PEOPLE CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE IN 
AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS THE 
INSTITUTIONS WHO ARE TRYING TO COME 
UP WITH THE REGULATIONS DON'T 
UNDERSTAND THE ENVIRONMENT THEY ARE 
TRYING TO REGULATE 
ONE 
OF THE DANGERS OF THIS LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE THINKING IT LOOKS 
GOOD FOR A GOVERNMENT TO SAY WE 
ARE GOING TO BAN PAEDOPHILES FROM 
THE INTERNET THAT SOUNDS GREAT 
BUT AS YOU ARE IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
ARE TRYING TO GET YOUR HEAD AROUND 
IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT DOES IT 
WHAT'S THE POINT IN SAYING 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT IF YOU CAN'T 
MAKE IT HAPPEN 
IT IS COMPLEX AND 
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PROPOSALS 
CAREFULLY THERE ARE SOME ISSUES 
AND I THINK SOME COMPANIES HAVE 
SOME EXPERIENCE IN AMERICA OF 
TRYING TO DO THIS AND HAVE WORKED 
OUT SOME ARRANGEMENTS WHAT IS 
CONCERNING IS THAT WE HAVE GOT TO 
MAKE SURE ANY LIST THAT IS 
DEVELOPED THAT IT IS ROBUST THAT 
YOU CAN TAKE SOMETHING THAT'S 
PUBLIC DATA AND TRANSFER IT TO A 
THIRD PARTY LIKE A COMPANY AND I 
THINK HOW WOULD THAT BE SECURED 
HOW WOULD THAT BE MANAGED IS 
IMPORTANT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE 
NOBODY IS WRONGLY IDENTIFIED AS AS 
BEING A PAEDOPHILE AND BECAUSE ESM 
MAIL ADDRESSES CHANGE A LETTER 
THESE THINGS ARE VERY THEY ARE 
CONCERNS TO INDUSTRY AND THESE ARE 
SOMETHING WE WOULD WISH TO TALK TO 
GOVERNMENT IN DEPTH ABOUT AND BE 
ASSURED THEY UNDERSTAND THE 
TECHNOLOGY AND THAT THE TECHNOLOGY 
CAN DELIVER THIS KIND OF SOLUTION 
THAT WE DON'T GIVE FALSE HOPE TO 
PEOPLE THAT THESE SOLUTIONS IT IS 
REALLY IMPORTANT THE MOST 
IMPORTANT THING IS THAT PARENTS 
ENGAGE WITH THEIR CHILDREN USE THE 
SOFTWARE THAT'S AVAILABLE AND KEEP 
AN ON GOING DIALOGUE AND THAT'S THE 
FORM OF PROTECTION REALLY FOR 
CHILDREN CHILDREN O. K. THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
OUR MAIN STORIES THIS MORNING 
ANOTHER CRUCIAL DAY FOR ROBERT 
MUGABE THE RESULTS OF THE DISPUTED 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION ARE DUE TODAY

PARTY TO DISCUSS THEIR NEXT 
MOVEMENT AS WE HAVE BEEN HEARING 
PROPOSALS FROM THE GOVERNMENT WILL 
STOP PAEDOPHILES LOGGING ON TO 
SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES COMING UP 
THE STRAYS WHICH PUT STRAIN ON 
RESOURCES IS IT HARDER TO GET 
TROUBLESOME HOUNDS OFF OUR STREETS 
SO CAROL HAS TAKEN A MOMENT AWAY 
FROM HER T'AI CHI THIS MORNING TO 
GET BACK TO THE WEATHER M. 
IT IS FAIRLY MILD FOR ALL OF US IT 
WILL TURN MUCH MUCH COLDER THAN IT 
HAS THIS WEEK ON THE SATELLITE 
PICTURE YOU CAN SEE THE EXTENT OF 
THE CLOUD OVER US THAT IS 
PRODUCING RAIN OVER THE NORTH OF 
SCOTLAND AND SOME DRIZZLE AND SOME 
SHOWERS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE 
COUNTRY NOT JUST THIS MORNING BUT 
THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON AS WELL WE 
HAVE FOG OVER THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND 
SOME MIST THAT WILL LIFT IN THE 
NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS THEN THERE'LL 
BE SOME CLOUD LEFT SOME BREAKS 
SOME SUNSHINE THE SAME THROUGH THE 
MIDLANDS INTO THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
AGAIN SOME MISTY PATCHES AROUND 
THEY WILL CLEAR BUT THEY WILL 
LEAVE CLOUD IN THE WAKE WITH SOME 
SUNSHINE BY NINE OH THE RAIN WILL 
JOURNEY SOUTH INTO NORTHERN IRELAND 
AS IT MOVES SOUTH IT WILL BE 
LIGHTER IN NATURE INTO WALES HERE 
TOO THERE IS FAIR BIT OF CLOUD 
AROUND A BIT OF MIRK OFF THE IRISH 
SEA AROUND THE BRISTOL CHANNEL AS 
WELL AROUND THE SOUTH WEST WE ARE 
LOOKING AT MIRK AND FOG IT WILL 
LIFT IN ITS WAKE WE WILL SEE LOW 
CLOUD THE CLOUD WILL BREAK IN 
PLACES WHERE IT DOES IT WILL FEEL 
PLEASANTLY WARM EIGHTEEN CELSIUS THE 
MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE THAT IS SIXTY FOUR 
FAHRENHEIT WAY ABOVE AVERAGE FOR 
THE TIME OF YEAR THROUGH THE 
EVENING THE PATCHY RAIN MOVES TO

TAKE US LONG WAY AHEAD TO THE 
SUMMER TO OUR SUMMER HOLIDAYS 
THERE IS TALK OF LOT OF RAIN 
WHAT IS ALL THIS ABOUT 
I KNOW 
THERE IS SOME HYPE IN THE PAPERS 
TODAY THAT IT WILL BE A TROPICAL 
SUMMER WE WOULD SAY IT IS GOING TO 
BE A TYPICAL SUMMER NOT A TROPICAL 
ONE SO BY THAT THERE'LL BE DAYS 
WHERE THE TEMPERATURE IS ABOVE 
AVERAGE FOR THE TIME OF THE YEAR 
AND DAYS WHEN IT IS NOT WHEN WE 
TALK ABOUT FALL RAIN RAIN FALL WE 
HAD THAT TERRIBLE DELUGE THIS YEAR 
THIS YEAR THE PROBLTD OF GETTING 
THAT EXCEPTIONAL RAIN FALL IS QUITE 
LOW NOT TROPICAL JUST TYPICAL 
SOME HOT DAYS SOME MILDER DAYS AND 
SOME RAIN THAT IS NOT THAT GOOD A 
HEADLINE 
LET'S FIND OUT THE NEWS FOR 
MORTGAGE HOLDERS IT IS SO HARD TO 
GET A GOOD DEAL AT THE MOMENT 
ISN'T IT THE BANK OF ENGLAND SAYS 
HALF THE LENDERS IT HAS SPOKEN TO 
ARE PLANNING TO FOLLOW CO OP AND 
FIRST DIRECT AND PUT A FREEZE ON 
SOME OF THEIR PRODUCTS HOW IS IT 
HITTING YOU WE HAVE BEEN TO THE 
STREETS OF NORWICH TO FIND OUT I I AM WORRIED SICK EVERYBODY WHERE I 
LIVE AT THE MOMENT EVERYBODY IS 
PUTTING THEIR HOUSES UP FOR SALE 
THERE ARE HOUSES UP FOR SALE ALL 
OVER THE PLACE IF YOU WANT TO GET 
OUT BEFORE ANYTHING GOES BAD YOU 
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO THE MARKET 
WILL NOW BE FLOODED WITH PROPERTIES 
IT IS NOT A GOOD TIME TO MORTGAGE 
NO WE RENT IT IS RENTAL MARKET 
AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED BUYING IS 
A BIG MISTAKE FOR A START THEY ARE 
NOT GIVING MORTGAGES OUT IF THEY 
ARE THEY ARE HIGH RATE NO IT 
SEEMS A VERY BAD TIME TO HAVE A 
MORTGAGE 
FOR US IT IS NOT A WORRY MORTGAGE BECAUSE OF THE TIME OF LIFE WE'RE 
AT WE'VE NOT GOT A MORTGAGE BUT 
FOR PEOPLE STARTING ON THE PROPERTY 
LADDER IT MUST BE PRETTY WORRYING 
DAVID KUO IS HERE FROM FOOLCO.UK

LEND WHO WILL I LEND IT TO 
RICHARD OR DAVID 
TO YOU 
NO WE ARE 
ALL COMPETING FOR THE SAME POUND 
THE BANKS DON'T HAVE A GREAT DEAL 
TO LEND OUT WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE 
CUTTING BACK ON DEALS 
THE KEY 
THING PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW IF YOU

A FIRST TIME BUYER SHOULD YOU HOLD 
OFF OR TRY AND GET A DECENT DEAL 
NOW SNFRPLTS I WOULD GO AS EARLY AS 
POSSIBLE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS

THEY NEED TO DO NOW TO ENSURE THEY 
HAVE A SUFFICIENT DEPOSIT IN ORDER 
TO SECURE THE DEALS OUT THERE GONE 
ARE THE DAY WHEN YOU GET ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
MORTGAGES EVEN NINETY FIVES PER CENT IS DIFFICULT 
THE KEY IS TO GET CRACKING

GIVE IT PROTECTION YOU CAN USE A 
BIG ICE CREAM CARTOON ANYTHING TO 
GIVE THEM PROTECTION 
IF WE GET 
HAIL WHICH A LOT OF PLACES ARE

IT IS 
LIKE SHOOTING A SHOTGUN AT A PLANT 
YOU CAN GET HOLES IN SOFT PETLES I I AM SURE EVERYONE WILL BE OUT 
GETTING NEWSPAPERS OVER THEIR 
PLANTS TEMPRAURES WILL

IT IS ANOTHER CRUCIAL DAY FOR 
ZIMBABWE'S PRESIDENT MUG PWHUG THE 
RESULT OF THE ELECTION DUE TO BE 
ANNOUNCED HE IS MEETING LEADERS OF 
THE ZANU P. F. TO DISCUSS WHAT THEY 
SHOULD DO NEXT THE OPPOSITION 
MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE HAVE 
ACCUSED HIM OF UNLEASHING WAR 
AFTER ITS OFFICES WERE RAIDED AND 
TWO FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WERE 
ARRESTED IN THIS REPORT COP TAINS 
FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY CONTAINS HE 
MAY LOOK RELAXED AN CONFIDENT BUT 
ROBERT MUGABE FACES THE BIGGEST 
EPOLITICAL TEST OF HIS LIFE TODAY 
THE TOP BRASS OF HIS PARTY WILL 
IMMEDIATE TO MEET TO DISCUSS 
THEIR SURVIVAL STRATEGY FAR FROM 
LOOKING LIKE A LEADER ON THE WAY 
OUT MR. ROBERT MUGABE SEEMS TO BE 
STAR SPARRING FOR A FIGHT THIS 
DESPITE A PARTY BADLY DAMAGED IN 
THE PARLIAMENTARY VOTE 
THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE HAVE BEEN 
TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THIS 
ELECTION DRAMA THOUGH THE 
OPPOSITION CLAIMS IT IS HAS WON 
THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE STATE MEDIA 
CONCEDES IT WILL PROBABLY GO TO A 
SECOND ROUND OFFICIAL RESULTS ARE 
DUE OUT TODAY 
WE WOULD HOPE THAT 
AGAIN EVERYBODY THAT ACCEPTS THOSE 
RESULTS IN THE WAY THEY HAVEN 
SEASON HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED UP TO 
NOW AND THAT THE LEGAL 
CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESSES OF 
ZIMBABWE WOULD THEN PROCEED VOTERS VOTERS WILL BE WATCHING CLOSELY AS THE 
RULING PARTIES SEARCHES FOR COMMON 
GROUND INSIDERS CLAIMING THAT 
ZANU P. F. IS SPLIT SOME WANTING TO 
FIGHT IT OUT OTHERS LOOKING TO CUT 
A DEAL PEOPLE ARE NERVOUS ABOUT 
WHAT COULD COME NEXT BUT BELIEVE 
CHANGE IS ROUND THE CORNER 
ZIMBABWE'S STREETS ARE PACKED WITH 
QUEUES AND ALIVE WITH RUMOURS AN 
OPPOSITION WIN COULD SEE WHITE 
FARMERS RETURN OR THAT A 
PRESIDENTIAL RUN OFF COULD SIGNAL A 
TIGHTENING UP OF SECURITY ON THE 
STREETS STILL UNCERTAIN TIMES FOR 
A PEOPLE WHOSE FUTURE SEEMS TO HAVE 
BEEN PUT ON HOLD WE WILL GET THE 
LATEST LIVE FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT 
ON THE ZIMBABWE BORDER IN JUST A 
FEW MINUTES TIME 
HERE PAEDOPHILES WHO DON'T INFORM 
THE POLICE OF THEIR E. MAIL ADDRESSS 
COULD FACE FIVE YEARS IN PRISON 
ACCORDING TO NEW GOVERNMENT 
PROPOSALS THE HOME OFFICE SAYS IT 
WANTS TO BAN CONVICTED CHILD SEX 
OFFENDERS FROM LOGGING ON TO SOCIAL 
NETWORKING SITES HERE IS OUR 
SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT 
I LIKE PLAYING FOOTBALL THE 
GOVERNMENT WANTS TO MAKE IT HARDER 
FOR SEX OFFENDERS TO GROOM CHILDREN 
ON LINE IT IS PARTICULARLY 
CONCERNED THAT SOCIAL NETWORKING 
SITES WHERE MILLIONS OF YOUNG 
PEOPLE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION 
ARE NOT AN EASY TARGET FOR 
PAEDOPHILES 
THERE IS A BILL PAEDOPHILES CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH PARLIAMENT 
THAT WILL GIVE US THE POWER TO 
CHANGE THE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT 
FOR SEX OFFENDERS WHEN WE HAVE 
THAT WE ARE ANNOUNCING OUR 
INTENTION WE REQUIRE THOSE POEM TO 
NOTIFY SUBJECT TO THE SEX OF 
FENDER REQUIREMENT TO NOTE FIR 
THEIR E. MAIL ADDRESSS 
FAILURE TO 
DO SO WILL CARRY A FIVE YEAR PRISON 
SENTENCES THE ADDRESS WILL BE SENT 
TO WEBSITE OPERATORS WHO WILL BE EX 
ECTED EXPECTED TO BLOCK THEM 
WITH SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES BASED 
ABROAD SOME ARE QUESTIONING 
WHETHER THE NEW RULES WILL ACTUALLY 
WORK 
THE ENTER THET CHANGES WORK RAPIDLY AND I BELIEF INTERNET 
CHANGES RAPIDLY AND I BELIEVE WE 
ARE MOVING AWAY FROM E. MAIL ADDRESS 
AS THE SOLE HOOK YOU NEED IN ORDER 
TO REGISTER THERE ARE SITES TODAY 
THAT ALLOW CHILDREN TO PLAY GAMES 
WITH EACH OTHER ACROSS THE WORLD 
AND WITH STRANGERS THAT DON'T 
REQUIRE AN E. MAIL ADDRESS TO 
REGISTER 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS REGISTER WORKING OUT THE DETAIL OP HOW THE 
NEW RULES WILL OPERATE BUT IT IS 
HOPING THOUSANDS OF CHILD SEX 
OFFENDERS WILL BE BARRED FROM USING 
SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES THE MODEL 
NECKACHE KNACK HAS BEEN A LEASED ON

CUTTING OFF CUSTOMERS WHO REFUSE TO 
STOP SHARING MUSIC BUT THE BOSS OF 
CARPHONE WAREHOUSE WHOSE TALKTALK 
BROADBAND IS BRITAIN'S THIRD 
BIGGEST PROVIDER IS FURIOUS ABOUT 
THAT DEMAND 
IF SOMEONE IF A THIRD 
PARTY IS OR WORRIED ABOUT WHAT 
THEY ARE DOING THEY CAN PURSUE OUR 
CUSTOMER BUT IT IS NOT OUR JOB TO 
BE THE POLICEMAN OF WHAT OUR 
CUSTOMERS ARE DOING 
THE MUSIC 
INDUSTRY SAYS LIT COME TO TALKTALK 
AND OTHERS WITH EVIDENCE THEIR 
CUSTOMERS ARE SWAPPING MUSIC ON 
LINE BUT IT WANTS THE COMPANIES TO 
ISSUE WARNINGS AND CUT OFF THOSE 
CUSTOMERS WHO PERSIST WITH C. D. 
SALES FALLING AND TWENTY TRACKS DOWN 
LOADED FREE FOR EVERY ONE BOUGHT 
THE MUSIC INDUSTRY SAYS IT HAS TO 
ACT 
WE WILL TAKE THE BURDEN OF ACT FINDING THE INFORMATION OUT THE 
I. S. P. DOESN'T NEED TO OPEN THE 
TRAFFIC UP THEY NEED TO RECEIVE THE 
INFORMATION WE SENT TO THEM AND NOT 
IGNORE IT 
THE MUSIC INDUSTRY 
BELIEVES INTERNET FIRMS SHOULD 
POLICE THEIR USERS ACTIVITIES AND 
IT IS CLAIMING THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
WILL STEP IN WITH NEW LAWS IF THEY 
DON'T CO OPERATE MARRIED MAN WHO 
USED TO A. B. WOMAN HAS APPEARED ON 
T. V. IN AMERICA TO TALK ABOUT HIS 
PREGNANCY THOMAS BEATIE IS SIX 
MONTHS PREGNANT AND EXPECTING A 
GIRL HE TOLD THE OPRAH WINFREY 
SHOW THAT BEING A MAN AND HAVING A 
BABY WASN'T PROBLEM FOR HIM I I HAVE A VERY STABLE MALE GENDER 
IDENTITY NOW I SEE PREGNANCY AS A 
PROCESS AND IT DOESN'T DEFINE WHO 
I AM I GOT THAT YEAH 
SO YEAH 
SO WHEN YOU DECIDED YOUR KEPT YOUR 
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS BECAUSE BECAUSE 
YOU THOUGHT MAYBE ONE DAY I WILL 
NEED THEM 
YES BECAUSE IT IS NOT A 
MALE OR FEMALE DESIRE TO WANT TO 
HAVE A CHILD IT IS A HUMAN DESIRE 
O. K. 
I AM A PERSON AND I HAVE THE O. K. RIGHT TO HAVE MY OWN BIOLOGICAL 
CHILD 
YOU CAN SEE OPRAH THINKING CHILD NOT QUITE SURE WHERE TO GO IT 
TAKES A BIT OF THINKING GOING 
THROUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING 
WHAT POINT DO YOU CHANGE FROM BEING 
A WOMAN TO MAN AND IF HE KEPT HIS 
FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS HE 
REMAINS A WOMAN YOU SEE THE BEARD 
WHICH IS CONFUSING TO SAY THE LEAST 
THAT IS A GOOD WAY TO DESCRIBE IT 
THOSE ARE THE TOP STORIES COMING 
UP WE HAVE ALL HEARD ABOUT HOW 
DRINKING PLENTY OF WATER CAN HELP 
US STAY HEALTHY BUT COULD WE BE 
JUST AS WELL OFF IF WE DRINK PLENTY 
OF SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD IT IS 
ALL COMING UP LET US RETURN TO OUR 
MAIN STORY AND THAT IS THE DEADLINE 
FOR ZIMBABWE'S ELECTORAL COMMISSION 
TO ANNOUNCE THE RESULT OF THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THE B. B. C. IS

POLITBURO WE ARE NO EXACT TIMINGS

GROUP CHAIRED BY ROBERT MUGABE WE

WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE IS 
GOING TO BE A RAUFPB ACCORDING TO 
LEGISLATION THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT 
FOR THE ANNOUNCING OF RESULTS THE 
APPARENTLY WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO 
SOME OF THOSE INVOLVED IN DRAFTING

GREENERY WAS IN THE AIR ALL OF A 
SUDDEN IT WILL BE COVERED IN SNOW 
ONCE AGAIN YOU ARE RIGHT THIS 
WEEKEND IT'S GOING TO TURN MUCH 
MUCH COLDER 
WE WILL SEE SOME SNOW OR SNOW 
SHOWERS SHOWERS TODAY THERE IS STILL A LITTLE BIT 
OF WARMTH AROUND AND ALSO A LOT OF 
CLOUD CLOUD IT'S CURRENTLY PRODUCING SOME 
DRIZZLE ONE OR TWO SHOWERS AND 
ALSO SOME RAIN 
RAIN CURRENTLY ACROSS THE NORTH OF 
SCOTLAND SCOTLAND THE OTHER THING WE HAVE THIS 
MORNING IS MIST AND FOG THE FOG IS 
LIFTING READILY 
BY NINE O'CLOCK WE ARE LOOKING AT 
A CLOUDY START TO THE DAY IN THE 
SOUTH EAST QUARTER WITH SOME 
SUNSHINE SUNSHINE THE SAME FOR THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
SOME MIST AROUND 
THE RAIN CURRENTLY ACROSS THE FAR 
NORTH OF SCOTLAND CONTINUING TO 
PUSH ACROSS CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
SCOTLAND SCOTLAND AS IT DOES SO IT'S TURNING MORE 
LIGHT AND PATCHY IN NATURE 
FOR WALES QUITE A BIT OF CLOUD 
AGAIN THICK ENOUGH TO PRODUCE SOME 
DRIZZLY BITS AND PIECES 
AROUND THE BRISTOL CHANNEL DRIZZLY 
THERE WILL BE LOW CLOUD TOWARDS 
WINDWARD COASTS 
THE CLOUD WILL BREAK AND WE WILL 
SEE SOME SUNSHINE WHERE WE DO WE 
WILL SEE TEMPERATURES OF EIGHTEEN CELSIUS 
THAT IS SIXTY FOUR FAHRENHEIT 
THAT'S WAY ABOVE AVERAGE FOR THE 
TIME OF THE YEAR 
THROUGH THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT 
OUR PATCHY BAND OF RAIN CONTINUES 
TO TRUNDLE DOWN TOWARDS THE SOUTH 
A NEW ONE COMES OUT IN ACROSS THE 
NORTH OF SCOTLAND FOLLOWED BY MUCH 
COLDER AIR 
QUITE A BIT OF SNOW ESPECIALLY TO 
HIGHER GROUND TO LOWER LEVELS WE 
COULD SEE SNOW SHOWERS 
WITH THE SUNSHINE THAT THE TIME OF 
THE YEAR EVEN IF THERE ARE 
TEMPORARY ACCUMULATIONS IT WON'T 
LAST TOO LONG IT WILL BE COLD THIS 
WEEKEND AND EVEN INTO THE EARLY 
PART OF NEXT WEEK TOO 
CATHERINE MARSTON IS AT A DOGS' 
HOME IN LEEDS GOOD MORNING 
CATHERINE CATHERINE GOOD MORNING MEET LITTLE PAMMY 
HERE SHE'S QUITE BOISTEROUS I 
HAVE ALAN ON STAND BY 
THIS LITTLE PAMMY WAS A STRAY UP 
UNTIL COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO SHE 
WAS PICKED UP BY A DOG WARDEN 
TAKEN TO KENNELS AND THEN THE DOGS' 
TRUST COLLECTED HER AND BROUGHTER 
WILL TO THEIR LEEDS REHOMING CENTRE 
AT THE MOMENT THE COUNCIL IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING STRAYS 
DURING OFFICE HOURS THE POLICE 
DEAL WITH THEM OVERNIGHT AND AT 
WEEKENDS FROM SUNDAY THAT IS 
ABOUT TO CHANGE THE POLICE WON'T 
DEAL WITH STRAY DOGS AT ALL UNLESS 
THEY ARE CONSIDERED TO BE DANGEROUS 
THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT THE 
COUNCIL SIMPLY CANNOT COPE WITH THE 
LARGE NUMBERS OF STRAIS ON THEIR 
STREETS AT WEEKENDS AND OVERNIGHT 
THE DOGS' TRUST IS WARNING THAT 
COULD HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES 
THIS IS WHAT THE DOGS TRUST 
WARRANTS WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE MORE 
OF WHEN COUNCILS TAKE ON FULL 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR STRAYS THEY CAN 
BE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES AND 
OTHERS IF HE MOMENT THE POLICE 
PICK UP STRAYS AND BRING THEM TO 
KENNELS OUT OF HOURS THAT'S ABOUT 
TO CHANGE COUNCILS WILL BECOME 
SOLELY RESPONSIBLE BUT DOGS' 
CHARITIES WARN THERE IS NOT ENOUGH 
FUNDING TO PAY FOR COUNCIL 
PROVISION THROUGH THE NIGHT AND 
THAT MEANS THAT THE PUBLIC WILL BE 
ASKED TO PICK UP STRAYS THEMSELVES 
IT'S ONLY TRUE DOG LOVERS THAT WILL 
GO THAT EXTRA MILE TO HELP THE DOGS 
MOST PEOPLE WON'T BE IN A POSITION 
PEOPLE MIGHT NOT HAVE A CAR YOU 
ARE ASKING THEM TO HANDLE DOGS THEY 
DON'T KNOW THAT COULD PUT PEOPLE 
AT RISK 
MOST COUNCILS DO NOT OWN 
KENNELS LAST YEAR ALONE EIGHT THOUSAND OF 
THE ONE HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND STRAYS COLLECTED WERE 
PUT DOWN AN EXTRA FOUR MILLION IS 
BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO HELP 
COUNCILS MAKE THESE CHANGES BUT 
EXPERTS FEAR IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH 
FOR A TWENTY FOUR HOUR SERVICE WE COULD BE 
ABOUT TO SEE MORE STRAYS ON OUR 
STREETS FOR FAR LONGER 
I SUPPOSE THAT IS THE QUESTION IF 
IT IS YOU OR I DRIVING DOWN THE 
STREET AND SEE A STRAY DOG WOULD 
WE WANT TO PICK IT UP AND PUT IT IN 
OUR CAR BOOT TO LOOK AT HOW 
SERIOUS AN ISSUE THIS COULD BE WE 
ARE JOINED BY AMANDA SANDS FROM THE 
DOGS TRUST HERE IN LEEDS WILL WE 
SEE DOGS IN PACKS ROAMING THE 
STREETS IN GREAT NUMBERS 
IT COULD 
HAPPEN DOGS WILL BE OUT ON THE 
STREETS FOR LONGER THEREFORE 
THERE WILL BE MORE OF THEM IT 
COULD LEAD TO PACKS IT COULD LEAD 
TO MORE ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS AS 
WELL THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT 
COULD HAPPEN 
ORIGINALS THE DOGS 
TRUST DO TRY TO TAKE IN SOME OF THE 
STRAYS BUT YOU ARE PRACTICALLY 
FULL ALL OF THE TIME 
YES WE DO 
TAKE AS MANY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN 
ONCE THEY'VE DONE THE TIME WITH THE 
COUNCIL IT IS UP TO OWNERS THEY 
NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND GET 
THEIR DOGS MICROCHIPPED AND COLLARS 
AND TAGS ON THEM THEN WE CAN GET 
DOGS BACK TO THEM 
CAN YOU WORK 
MORE CLOSELY WITH COUNCILS TO HELP 
THEM OUT CAN YOU GET INVOLVED IN 
SOME WAY IN THESE CHANGES EM EM ONLY BE ADVISING AND TAKING AS MANY 
DOGS AFTER THE SEVEN DAYS AS 
POSSIBLE WE AND OTHER CHARITIES 
TRY TO REHOME THE DOGS AMANDA AMANDA THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE ADVICE AS ALWAYS IF YOU OWN A 
DOG THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS 
MAKE SURE IT'S CHIPPED IF IT EVER 
GETS OUT ON THE RUN IT CAN BE 
RETURNED SAFELY TO YOU 
NOW HOW MANY GLASSES OF WATER DO 
YOU DRINK EVERY DAY 
IF IT'S EIGHT THEN YOU ARE SIPPING 
THE RECOMMENDED AMOUNT TO STAY 
HEALTHY BUT COULD YOU BE WASTING 
YOUR TIME RESEARCHERS SAY FOR THE 
AVERAGE PERSON THERE IS NO REAL 
EVIDENCE OF ANY HEALTH BENEFIT FROM 
WATER COMPARED TO ANY OTHER NON 
ALCOHOLIC DRINK CATHERINE COLLINS 
A NUTRITIONIST AND DIANA MORAN 
THE GREEN GODDESS JOINS US THIS 
MORNING GOOD MORNING EVERYONE WAS 
UNDER THE IMPRESSION IS THAT 
DRINKING A LOT OF WATER IS WHAT YOU 
SHOULD DO 
WATER IS THE PUREST WAY 
OF GETTING LIQUID INTO THE BODY 
TEA COFFEE SQUASH AND SOUP EVEN 
BEER AND LAGER ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE 
TO YOUR FLUID INTAKE IT'S ACTUALLY 
A MYTH THAT WE NEED THE TWO LITRES 
A DAY THIS IS FROM RESEARCH IN THE 
NINETEEN FORTIES THAT WAS MISINTERPRETED AND 
FORGOT TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT WATER 
IN FOOD OF WHICH THERE IS QUITE A 
LOT WE NEED TO DRINK REGULARLY 
BUT IT CAN BE A VARIETY OF THINGS 
YOU ARE NOT SUGGESTING WE SHOULD 
COUNT OUR ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION 
TOWARDS OUR HEALTHY INTAKE OF 
FLUIDS 
AS DIETICIANS WE RECOMMEND FLUIDS A SMALL AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL IF YOU 
DON'T MIND IT IS PROTECTIVE FOR 
THINGS LIKE HEART DISEASE IT'S 
VERY HEALTHY FOR YOU EXCESSIVE 
AMOUNTS ARE NOT THIS IDEA OF 
DRINKING ALL OF THE TIME SIPPING 
WATER ALL OF THE TIME IS AN URBAN 
MYTH RESEARCH FROM THE UNIVERSITY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA HAS DEMONSTRATED 
THAT THERE'S NO BACKGROUND SCIENCE 
TO IT YOU NEED TO DRINK WHEN YOU 
ARE THIS IS B. B. C. NEWS TWENTY FOUR Y. AND WEE A 
FEW TIMES A DAY IF YOU ARE DOING 
THAT YOU ARE GETTING ENOUGH FLUID 
DIANA WHERE ARE YOU ON THIS ONE I I AGREE WITH MOST OF WHAT YOU ARE 
SAYING BUT MAKE IT CLEAR THAT SOME 
OF THE OTHER DRINKS THAT WE DO 
DRINK I. E. ALCOHOL AND THE COFFEE 
ARE ALSO DIURETICS THEREFORE 
THEY'RE MAKING US WANT TO SPEND A 
PENNY MORE OFTEN THEREFORE WE 
MUST KEEP REPLACING THIS EXCESS 
THAT WE ARE LOSING THROUGH THE 
ALCOHOL I MEAN ANYBODY WILL KNOW 
THAT IF YOU HAVE HAD A HEAVY NIGHT 
ON THE ALCOHOL IF YOU HAVE HAVEN'T 
HAD A GLASS OR TWO OF WATER AS YOU 
HAVE GONE TO BED YOU ARE GOING TO 
FEEL AN AWFUL LOT WORSE IN THE 
MORNING 
JUST LOOKING AT IT SITTING MORNING ON A TRAY IN FRONT OF US EIGHT 
GLASSES IT LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF 
WATER IS IT WHAT YOU AIM TO DRINK 
I DON'T AIM TO DRINK JUST THE 
GLASSES OF WATER IN NO WAY DO I 
I'M SOMEBODY WHO EATS TREMENDOUS 
AMOUNT OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
THERE IS A LOT OF WATER CONTENT IN 
THEM 
THEY'RE MAINLY WATER THEM CATHERINE CAN I GET THIS CLEAR 
ACROSS THE COURSE OF DAY IF YOU 
EAT ORDINARY FOOD AND YOU DON'T 
DRINK ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT ARE 
YOU SAYING THAT'S ENOUGH DO YOU 
HAVE TO DRINK WATER 
YOU HAVE TO 
HAVE A LITTLE BIT TO DRINK IF YOU 
EAT A LOT OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 
THEY'RE NINETY FIVE PER CENT WATER BY COMPOSITION 
THERE IS A LOT OF WATER IN AN APPLE 
BUT BREAD AND CHEESE WHICH WE 
THINK OF AS DRY FOODS ARE A THIRD 
WATER BY VOLUME DIANA MENTIONED 
THE CAFFEINE AND THE DIURETIC THIS 
IS ANOTHER URBAN MYTH CAFFEINE IS 
NOT A DIURETIC IT'S ABOUT THE 
VOLUME YOU DRINK IF YOU HAVE A 
GRANDE COFFEE YOU WILL WANT TO GO 
TO THE TOILET LATER IT'S NOTHING 
TO DO WITH THE COFFEE IT'S TO DO 
WITH THE VOLUME OF LIQUID IF YOU 
ARE JUST HAVING CAFFEINEIATED 
DRINKS ALL DAY YOU MIGHT END UP 
BEING WIRED IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A 
VARIETY 
DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE VARIETY GET CONFUSED ABOUT THIS SORT OF 
THING ON THE ONE HAND WE ARE TOLD 
TO DRINK PLENTY OF WATER AND WE BUY 
BOTTLED WATER ON THE OTHER HAND 
WE ARE TOLD IF YOU EAT YOUR NORMAL 
DIET AND HAVE A HALF OF A CUP OF 
TEA 
I STILL FEEL THAT 
FOR ME AND TEA FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT I KNOW TO 
DRINK QUITE A LOT OF WATER MAKES US 
FEEL BETTER L. MEAN THINK ABOUT 
YOUR SKIN FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IS THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PRUNE AND A 
PLUM IT'S AGE AND WATER CONTENT 
WATER PUMPS UP AND PLUMPS UP THE 
SKIN 
IT DOES THE RESEARCH THAT SKIN GENERATES THIS INTEREST AS LONG AS 
YOU ARE HYDRATED THAT IS AS MUCH 
PLUMPING AS YOU NEED FOR OLDER 
PEOPLE WHERE DEHYDRATION IS AN 
ISSUE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE 
SAME THIRST MECHANISM IF YOUR SKIN 
PINCHS AND STAYS PINCHED YOU ARE 
DEHYDRATED 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DEHYDRATED DEHYDRATED 
YES IN AIR CONDITIONED DEHYDRATED OFFICES AND AFTER EXERCISE YES WE WE ARE TOLD EIGHT GLASSES A DAY BUT 
IT'S BASED ON THE NINETEEN FORTIES BUT FOR 
THE LAST SIXTY YEARS WE HAVE BEEN 
TOLD SOMETHING ELSE 
THAT IS 
MARKETING AND P. R. FOR WATER 
COMPANIES THE SCIENCE HAS ALWAYS 
BEEN THERE IT CAME IN NINETY TWO AGAINST 
FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF DARTMOUTH IN 
THE U. S. THIS RESEARCH NOW IS SAYING 
WHAT DIETICIANS AND NUTRITIONISTS 
KNOW FOR A LOT TIME IF YOU HAVE A 
TEMPERATURE IF YOU HAVE DIARRHOEA 
IF YOU ARE AN EXERCISE FREAK YOU 
NEED MORE WATER YOU FEEL THIRSTY 
SO YOU DRINK MORE 
WE ARE LIVING IN 
A HUMID ENVIRONMENT WITH THE 
ALCOHOL HEATING AND ALSO WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT THE FRUITS AND 
VEGETABLES AND THE WATER CONTENT 
BUT DO YOU SQUEEZE FRESH ORANGES 
AND THINGS IN THE MORNING L. L. DO 
BUT HOW MUCH IS THE LIQUID CONTENT 
VERY VERY SMALL A LOT OF PEOPLE 
DON'T EAT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
I'M AFRAID WE ARE OUT OF TIME ON 
THIS ONE THANK YOU SO MUCH IT'S 
FASCINATING IT'S INTRIGUING IT IT REALLY IS 
IT'S LEFT ME FEELING A LITTLE BIT 
THIRSTY THIRSTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
LET'S TAKE YOU THROUGH SOME OF THE 
RESPONSES ON WOLF WHISTLE DIANA

THE RIPE OLD AGE OF THIRTY SEVEN 
WHEN I MET YOU SIX MONTHS AGO YOU 
SAID I WILL GIVE IT A GO I 
THOUGHT NICE IDEA WHAT HAPPENED 
REGARDING THE HAIR THINK IT IS 
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE THE WORLD 
CHAPS IN MANCHESTER NEXT WEEK I'M 
IN FANTASTIC SHAPE AND I WENT UP 
THERE TO SEE WHAT I COULD AND 
WHILE I CAN DO T. I THOUGHT WHY NOT 
ONCE YOU ARE RETIRED YOU ARE A 
LONG TIME RETIRED 
WHEN I SAW YOU THAT LONG TIME AGO 
YOU WERE SAYING I WAS THINKING OF 
GIVING UP WHAT INSPIRED YOU TO 
GET BACK 
FOR THE THRAST TWO YEARS 
THE LAST TWO YEARS I KEPT MYSELF 
IN SHAPE L. ENJOY GETTING IN THE

OF MODELLING L. HAVE HAD TO KEEP 
MYSELF IN SHAPE FOR THAT L. HAD A 
FEW MEETS IN EUROPE AND HAD 
FANTASTIC RESULTS IT WAS MY DREAM 
TO GO TO THE OLYMPIC GAMES AND I 
THOUGHT IF I CAN STILL DO IT AND I 
CAN GO ONE MORE TIME WHY NOT HAVE 
ANOTHER GO 
I HAVE SEEN YOUR BODY 
IN THE NEW SWIMMING COSTUMES HAVE 
THEY MADE A DIFFERENCE 
IT HOLDS 
EVERYTHING IN IF YOU HAVE ANY LOSE 
BITS IT HOLDS EVERYTHING IN 
DOES IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE 
PERFORMANCE 
THEY MAKE YOU PERFORMANCE STREAMLINED THEY ARE SO COMPRESSED 
THERE IS NO SEAMS IT IS ALMOST 
LIKE THE UNDERNEATH OF A BOAT IT 
IS SO SMOOTH IT MAKES PEOPLE MORE 
EFFICIENT IT IMPROVED TIMES 
BUT INNOVATION CHANGES AND 
TECHNOLOGY CHANGES AND THINGS MOVE 
ON AND THINGS PROGRESS L. AM TWENTY FIVE 
YEARS REPRESENTING BRITAIN I HAVE 
LEARNED SO MUCH ALONG THE WAY THAT 
I HAVE CHANNELLED AND I HAVE GOT 
WHAT WORKS FOR ME IF I CAN IMPROVE 
IF I CAN BREAK THE BRITISH RECORD 
AGAIN AND IMPROVE AND CONTINUE IT 
WON'T LAST FOREVER THERE WILL BE A 
BREAK OFF POINT AND I'M NEAR THAT 
POINT AND ONE MORE GO 
I'M FASCINATED YOU SAID AT SOME 
POINT YOU ARE SWIMMING ONLY ONCE A 
MONTH MONTH WHEN YOU ARE JUST DABBLING HOW 
MUCH QUICKER HAVE YOU GOT 
I STAYED 
WHERE I WAS IT IS NOT AS IF 
NORMALLY IF PEOPLE DON'T DO A LOT 
THEY FALL BEHIND THEIR BEST L. 
MAINTAINED AND STAYED IN MY BEST A 
LOT OF THAT CAME FROM REST IS 
IMPORTANT AS THE TRAINING SOMETIMES 
IF WE TRAIN DAY IN AND DAY OUT YOU 
ARE HITTING YOUR BODY ALL THE TIME 
AND YOU ARE DAMAGING IT THAT 
PERIOD GAVE MY BODY A CHANCE TO 
RECOVER MAYBE I GREW A FEW MORE

CHRIS I THINK HIS MODELLING AGENT 
WILL BE ON TO YOU 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
CAROL HAS BEEN TRYING OUT TAI CHI 
IN THE BLUE PETER GARDEN FOR US 
THIS MORNING 
WITH BIT OF LUCK WE CAN SEE HER 
NOW THERE SHE IS THROWING SHAPES 
IS THAT A TECHNICAL TERM THROWING 
SHAPES IS THAT THE CRANE NEW 
RESEARCH CLAIMS IT CAN HELP PEOPLE 
WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM TYPE TWO 
DIABETES DIABETES DAN DOHERTY AND KATHY IS FROM 
DIABETES U. K. WHAT'S THE MOVE CAROL 
WAS DOING 
THE FIRST IS STEP UP SEVEN STARS 
AND SECOND STEP BACK TO RIDE THE 
TIGER TIGER WHAT IS THE ED ON THIS THAT IT CAN 
HELP DIABETES 
PEOPLE WITH DIABETES 
MUST EXERCISE TO HELP CONTROL THEIR 
BLOOD GLUE COWES LEVEL AND BLOOD 
PRESSURE THE RESEARCH FROM THE 
T'AI CHI STUDIES SHOWS NOT ONLY IS 
EXERCISE GOOD AND RELAXATION 
ELEMENT IS GOOD DOIBTS U. K. REFER TO 
EXERCISE AS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THE 
RECOMMENDED FOR AN ADULT PER DAY IS 
THIRTY MINUTES L. THINK FROM TALKING TO 
DAN THIRTY MINUTES OF THIS INTENSITY 
ALL IN ONE GO IS A LOT BUT IT CAN 
BE SPLIT UP INTO SMALLER CHUNKS IS IS T'AI CHI EXERCISE DOES IT COUNT 
AS GOOD PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 
IT WORKS 
ON DIFFERENT LEVELS WHAT THEY ARE 
DOING IN THE GARDEN IS ALL THE SOFT 
SLOW STUFF THAT IS GOOD FOR THE 
JOINTS BLOOD CIRCULATION FOR 
DEVELOPING DEEP BREATHING AND SO ON 
THERE ARE ASPECTS OF T'AI CHI WHICH 
ARE MORE DYNAMIC WEAPONS TRAINING 
SELF DEFENCE T'AI CHI WRESTLING 
ALL THESE ASPECTS BUT ON A HEALTH 
LEVEL T'AI CHI IS EXCELLENT FOR 
DIEGTS OTHER ILLNESSES ASTHMA FOR DIABETES OTHER 
ILLINGWORTHNESSES THERE ARE 
RESULTS 
THERE THERE IS A PROBLEM RESULTS TELL THE TEACHER FIRST CERTAIN 
TYPES OF TRAINING MAY NOT BE 
APPROPRIATE 
CAROL WE ARE SAYING APPROPRIATE IT COULD BE GOOD FOR TYPE TWO 
DIABETES WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN TYPE ONE AND TWO DIABETES 
DOES IT MEAN IT IS NOT GOOD FOR 
TYPE ONE DIABETES 
IN TYPE ONE THE 
CELLS THAT MAKE INSULIN WHICH 
MOVES GLUCOSES INTO THE BLOOD HAVE 
BEEN DESTROYED FOR REASONS WHICH WE 
THINK ARE AN AUTOIMMUNE REACTION 
BUT RESEARCH IS STILL GOING ON IN 
TYPE TWO DIABETES WHICH ACCOUNTS 
FOR EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE WITH DIABETES 
THE INSULIN IS NOT ABLE TO FUNCTION 
PROPERLY RESEARCH HAS SHOWN IT IS 
LINKED TO LIFESTYLE PEOPLE WITH 
TYPE ONE DIABETES NEED TO BE 
PHYSICALLY ACTIVE THAT CAN BE ANY 
ACTIVITY FROM WALKING SWIMMING 
BUT NOT QUITE LIKE MARK DOES OR 
CYCLING IT 
WILL NOT HAVE A 
DIRECT EFFECT 
IT WILL HELP CONTROL 
THE BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS IT WILL 
HELP PEOPLE ADJUSTING THEIR LIVE 
STYLES BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT 
DEVELOP TYPE TWO DIABETES IT CAN 
HELP PREVENT 
WE WILL LOOK AT CAROL 
ARE THERE CERTAIN TYPES WHO ARE 
SUITED TO T'AI CHI IT SEEMS MELLOW 
CAN ANYONE DO IT 
ANYONE CAN DO IT 
THE POINT IS TO FIND A TEACHER WHO 
HAS BEEN APPROACH WHICH SUITS YOU 
FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE HAVING THE 
BRITISH CHAMPIONSHIPS ON SUNDAY SO 
THAT IS COMPETITIVE T'AI CHI IT 
TENDS TO BE YOUNGER PEOPLE OR 
PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE ACTIVE OR 
DYNAMIC 
ARE YOU ENJOYING IT IT DYNAMIC IT HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS ONE 
THING I HAVE LEARNT IS IT IS GOOD 
FOR BREATHING L. SHALLOW BREATHE 
ALL THESE SLOW MOVEMENTS MAKE YOU 
THINK ABOUT IT AS YOU PUSH OUT YOU 
BREATHE OUT AS YOU PUSH BACK YOU 
BREATHE IN 
THANK YOU BOTH 
ALL OF YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH L. 
DID A BIT OF T'AI CHI AFTER MY 
SECOND BABY DID YOU NOT KEEP 
GOING GOING NO I DIDN'T AFTER THE THIRD ONE I 
DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO DO ANYTHING 
ELSE ELSE SPRING HAS SPRUNG WELL WE THOUGHT 
SO YESTERDAY FLOWERS IN FULL BLOOM 
THEY MAY NOT BE LOOKING SO HEALTHY 
AFTER THIS WEEKEND THE WEATHER 
FORECAST SUGGESTS SNOW IS ON THE 
CARDS WHAT CAN GUARDERS DO 
GUARD ENERS DO 
GOOD MORNING TO YOU IT IS A 
BEAUTIFUL MORNING THIS MORNING 
THIS WEEKEND IT WILL BE COLD WE'LL 
HAVE HAIL BITTER WINDS MAYBE SNOW 
WHAT ABOUT THE PLANTS HOW WILL 
THEY SURVIVE MANY THINK THE 
WEATHER IS NOW SPRING TIME FOR 
EXPERT ADVICE FROM PIPPA GREENWOOD 
A CHALLENGING FEW DAYS AHEAD FOR 
GARDENERS WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE IT IT WILL BE AWFUL THE SUNSHINE NOW IS 
WARMING EVERYTHING UP IT HAS BEEN 
MILD A LOT OF PLANTS HAVE PUT ON 
AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF GROWTH NOW 
HIT THEM WITH HAIL OR SNOW YOU 
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO PROTECT 
THEM EVEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
CLEMATIS IT IS FRESH OUT OF A 
GARDEN CENTRE IT HAS SOFT GROWTH 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS MAGNOLIA OR IF 
YOU HAVE THEM IN POTS THE PETLES 
ARE EASILY DAMAGED COVER THEM WITH 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS GREEN FLEECE 
BAG WHICH YOU CAN PUT OVER A SHRUB 
IF YOU HAVE FRUIT TREES THAT IS 
IMPORTANT TO IF THE BLOSSOM GETS 
HIT BY FROST YOU WILL NOT GET 
FRUITS 
YOU CAN USE PYJAMAS NET FRUITS CURTAINS 
YES ANYTHING OLD NETS CURTAINS NEWSPAPER WORKS WELL IT NEEDN'T BE 
SOMETHING YOU SPEND ANY MONEY ON 
BRING THE PLANT INTO THE HOUSE OR GREENHOUSE 
BRINGING THEM INTO A GREENHOUSE SOUTH OR WEST WALL OF YOUR HOUSE 
WILL HELP IF YOU HAVE A PORCH 
EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GREENHOUSE 
THAT WILL MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE 
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THESE PLANTS 
THEY ARE JUST THE THING THAT PEOPLE 
BRIGHTEN THEIR GARDENS UP WITH AS 
SOON AS SPRING STARTS THEY WILL BE 
BADLY DAMAGED SOMETHING LIKE ONE 
OF THESE MINICLOCHES GOES OVER THE 
TOP IT WILL GIVE IT PHYSICAL 
PROTECTION 
THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH PROTECTION FOR THOSE WORDS OF ADVICE IT WILL 
GET SO COLD THIS WEEKEND HARD TO 
BELIEVE NOW THERE IS BEAUTIFUL 
WARM SUNSHINE WRAP UP WARM IF YOU 
GET A CHANCE MAYBE WRAP YOUR PLANTS 
UP WARM AS WELL LOCK AT TIM THERE 
FULL SUNSHINE GARDEN LOOKING 
LOVELY SPRINGLIKE SNOW AND HAIL 
ON THE WAY CAN'T BELIEVE IT 
THIS WEEKEND THE OLYMPIC FLAME WILL 
BE CARRIED ACROSS LONDON AS PART OF 
THE GLOBAL JOURNEY TO THE BEIJING 
OLYMPICS THE TORCH HAS ATTRACTED 
UNWELCOME PUBLICITY WITH SOME OF 
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO CARRY 
IT DROPPING OUT IN PROTEST AT 
CHINA'S ACTIONS IN TIBET KONNIE 
HUQ HAS AGREED TO TAKE PART IN THE 
CEREMONY SHE IS HERE THIS MORNING 
GOOD MORNING 
GOOD MORNING 
SO HOW HAS THIS BEEN HAS IT BEEN 
A DIFFICULT DECISION FOR YOU YES YES AND NO TAKING PART IN THE TORCH 
RELAY DOES NOT IN MY WAY MEAN I 
CONDONE CHINA AND THEIR ACTIVITIES 
IN TIBET AND THEIR REPRESSION OF 
PEOPLE BUT I DO THINK IT IS 
IMPORTANT IF YOU HAVE VIEWS TO 
SPEAK OUT ON THEM L. KNOW A LOT OF 
PEOPLE WILL PROTEST PEOPLE WERE 
PROTESTING IN TURK AND I THINK IT 
IS IMPORTANT THAT CHINA KNOW PEOPLE 
ARE ANGRY AT THEM AND WHAT THEY ARE 
DOING IS WRONG IT WOULD BE GOOD TO 
EMBARRASS THEM IN A WAY OR 
HUMILIATE THEM THIS IS A PLATFORM 
TO MAKE A CHANGE BUT OBVIOUSLY THE 
OLYMPICS TRANSCENDS ANY SINGLE 
NATION IT IS ABOUT WE SHOULD SAY 
AS YOU CAN TALKING TO US WE ARE 
SEEING PROTESTS DURING THE LEG IN 
ATHENS I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT 
ALL AROUND THE WORLD ARE PROTESTS 
I HAD LOADS OF LETTERS FROM LOB 
BIGROUPS PEOPLE TELLING THEIR 
ACCOUNTS TIBETAN REFUGEES L. FEEL 
BAD NOT TO TAKE ANY OF THAT INTO 
ACCOUNT BUT YET YOU HAVE DECIDED 
TO CARRY THE TORCH 
IT IS ABOUT 
GLOBAL HARMONY IT TRANSCENDS ANY 
ONE NATION THE OLYMPIC SPIRIT AND 
OLYMPIC ETHOS IS A GOOD ONE THE 
OLYMPICS IS COMING TO LONDON IN 
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOUNG 
PEOPLE IT IS NOT A GOOD THING TO 
OVERSHADOW THE OLYMPICS 
IS THIS 
SOMETHING DID YOU GO TO OTHERS 
AND SAY I AM WORRIED ABOUT THIS I I HAVE FRIENDS WHO WILL BE PROTESTING 
WHICH IS WEIRD PEOPLE SAID TO ME 
WEAR A FLAG OR WHATEVER YOU HAVE 
TO WEAR THE UNIFORM ANY WAY L. L. WAS 
LIKE I CAN'T ONLY MY TRAINERS WILL 
BE MY OWN MAYBE THEY WILL SAY NOT 
MADE IN CHINA ON THEM I DON'T 
KNOW EVERYONE HAS A VIEW IT IS 
IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHAT IS 
GOING ON 
DO YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE 
IN THE SENSE YOU ARE PROMOTING THE 
OLYMPICS BUT SOME PEOPLE WILL SEE 
YOU I MEAN LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 
COMEDIAN ON CHANNEL FOUR NEWS SAYS I 
AM WITHDRAWING I DON'T WANT TO 
CARRY THIS BECAUSE IT 
LEGITIMATISES WHAT CHINA IS DOING 
DO YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE THAT THAT 
IS HOW SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SEE WHAT 
YOU ARE DOING 
WELL THE THING IS 
FOR SEVEN YEARS THE OLYMPICS IS 
HAPPENING IN CHINA TIANANMEN 
SQUARE WAS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AGO IT 
IS NOT LIKE WE DIDN'T KNOW THE 
SITUATION WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS TO 
SPEAK OUT AND USE IT AS A PLATFORM 
PERHAPS THIS IS A TIME WHEN MAYBE 
CHANGE CAN HAPPEN ALL EYES THE 
I. O. C. SAID BY HAVING THE OLYMPICS IN 
CHINA IT WILL ACTUALLY PERHAPS HELP 
WITH FREEDOM OF PRESS BECAUSE A 
LOT OF PRESS AND MEDIA WILL BE 
GOING INTO CHINA IT IS AN 
OPPORTUNITY WHERE MAYBE SOME SORT 
OF CHANGE CAN HAPPEN AND SO EVEN 
IF YOU ARE I DON'T EXPECT 
SPORTSMEN WILL BE PULLING OUT IT 
IS NOT WHAT IT IS ABOUT THE 
OLYMPICS IS NOT ABOUT THE FACT IT 
IS IN CHINA BUT IF IT CAN BE USED 
TO PERHAPS HELP THE SITUATION THEN 
SURELY THAT IS A GOOD THING WELL WELL IT WILL BE A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE FOR 
YOU THAT IS FOR SURE REGARDLESS 
OF THE MORALS 
I HOPE I DON'T TRIP 
UP OR ANYTHING 
PUT THE FLAME OUT 
IT WILL BE A BAD THING TO DO DON'T DON'T SAY THAT SUNDAY L. AM DOING SUNDAY I AM DOING LADBROKE GROVE AM THIRD STEVE 
REDGRAVE THEN ME

THE MOMENT CLEAR AS WHISTLE 
HEADING TOWARDS THE STRAND 
UNDERPASS THANK YOU THE CAPITAL 
IS GEARING UP TO WELCOME THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH THIS WEEKENDMENT SOME 
LONDONERS ARE PREPARING TO USE THE 
OCCASION TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE 
CHINESE AUTHORITIES T. TIBETAN 
COMMUNITY SAY THEY WILL PROTEST 
AGAINST CHINA'S RULE OF TIBET AS 
THE TORCH MAKES ITS WAY ACROSS THE 
CITY RATHER CLOUDY BUT DRY W. 
FEW SUNNY SPELLS A HIGH OF A LOVELY 
EIGHTEEN CELSIUS 
WELCOME BACK UNTIL NOW IT HAS BEEN 
A FAVOURITE WAY OF OFFERING 
COMPLIMENT TO A PASSING LADY BUT 
THE BUILDING INDUSTRY'S WOLF 
WHISTLING DAYS COULD BE NUMBERED 
ONE CONSTRUCTION FIRM BANNED ITS 
BRICKIES FROM WHISTLING SAYING THE 
OUTDATED TRADITION HAS BECOME A 
DISTRACTION FOR YOUNG HOUSE HUNTERS 
HERE IS WHAT YOU THOUGHT 
A NICE GIRL WALKS PAST SHORT SKIRT 
YOU KNOW AND THE SUN IS OUT AND 
YOU GIVE HER THE OLD WHISTLE 
PEOPLE ARE WHISTLING FOR A REASON 
IT IS A COMPLIMENT AND PEOPLE 
SHOULD FEEL ABOUT IT 
DO YOU DO YOU WHISTLE AT 
BOYS BOYS WE DO IF THEY ARE GOOD GOOD 
LOOKING LOOKING IT IS EMBARRASSING FOR PEOPLE 
THERE IS A TENDENCY TO BE TOO 
SENSITIVE THESE DAYS AND SURELY 
THEY'RE JUST SHOWING AFFECTION AND 
SAYING WE LOOK NICE WHY WOULD I BE 
OFFENDED BY THAT 
I CAN'T WHISTLE 
ANYMORE BUT YEAH COURSE YEAH L. 
MEAN IT WAS THE WAY OF SHOWING 
APPRECIATION IN THOSE DAYS NOW 
WELL I RECKON DEEP DOWN THEY LIKE 
IT 
THERE IS NO EQUIFFICATION THERE HE 
KNOWS WHAT HE LIKES CRAIG PHILLIPS 
IS HERE ALONG WITH THE EDITOR OF 
TOP SANTE MAGAZINE NICOLA DOWN 
WHATEVER PEOPLE MIGHT EXPECT GOOD 
MORNING 
GOOD MORNING MORNING PEOPLE WILL BE SURPRISED 
CRAIG WHAT DO YOU THINK DO YOU 
THINK WOLF WHISTLE FROM THE 
FOLDING IS ACCEPTABLE 
I HAVE SEEN 
A LOT OF IT BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN 
GIRLS BEING OFFENDED IT IS A 
DIFFICULT ONE L. WALKED PAST PLACES 
AND BEEN WHISTLED AT MYSELF BY 
LADIES 
LADIES WORKING ON BUILDING LADIES SITES 
NOT LADIES WORKING ON SITES BUILDING SITES WHETHER IT BE BARS 
BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN OFFENDED BUT 
FELT EMBARRASSED 
WHAT DO YOU SAY 
WHEN IT HAPPENED 
A FEW YEARS AGO HE GAVE ME A 
SPRING IN MY STEP L. THINK THERE 
SHOULD BE MORE WOLF WHISTLING IN 
THE WORLD NOT DONE IN ANY 
THREATENING OR INTAME DATING 
ENVIRONMENT BUT IT GAVE ME A LIFT 
AND I THINK MENTION SHOULD BE WOLF 
WHISTLED TOO 
IT CAN MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD AND WE 
ARE SO HARD ON OURSELVES WHEN WE 
GET UP IN THE MORNING WE LOOK IN 
THE MIRROR AND THE FIRST THING WE 
SEE WE NOTICE A WRINKLE AND WE ARE 
USED TO BEING SO NEGATIVE ABOUT 
OURSELVES AND SOMETIMES THESE 
LITTLE LIFTS ARE THE THINGS WE NEED 
TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT OURSELVES 
I COULDN'T MEAN TO BE A KILL JOY 
BUT IT DEPENDS WHAT MOOD YOU ARE IN 
YOU CAN BE IN GREAT MOOD AND 
FEELING GOOD ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE 
WEARING AND IF YOU GET A WOLF 
WHISTLE THAT WILL BE A COMPLIMENT 
YOU CAN BE IN FOUL MOOD AND YOU 
GET CHEER UP IT MAY NEVER 
HAPPEN 
IT WAS A COMMENT AFTER THE HAPPEN WOLF WHISTLE IT IS WIMPY 
CONSTRUCTION THAT ARE DOING IT 
PERHAPS IF I WAS GOING INTO A HOUSE 
AND I WAS LOOKING AT BUYING AND I 
WALKED INTO A HOUSE AND THERE WAS A 
BUILDER AND THEY WOLF WHISTLED AT 
ME I WOULDN'T LIKE IT L. WOULD 
RATHER THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE 
BRICKS THAN ME BUM 
WOLF WHISTLING SEEMS TO ME IS 
SOMETHING THAT'S O. K. IF YOU ARE 
CERTAIN DISTANCE AWAY BUT IF YOU 
ARE CLOSE TO SOMEONE THAT'S 
OFFENSIVE YOU COULD TALK TO ME 
INSTEAD DO YOU THINK L. DON'T KNOW 
USUALLY WHEN IT IS GROUPS OF LADS 
UP ON A FOLD AND ONE LADY ON THEIR 
OWN OWN IF A GROUP OF LADIES WENT PAST HE 
PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE AS CONFIDENT 
I DON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN I HAVE 
TWO NIECES BUT THEY LOOK OLDER 
THAN WHAT THEY ARE AND I WOULDN'T 
LIKE THEM TO BE WALKING PAST 
BUILDING SITE AND TO BE WOLF 
WHISTLED OR COMMENTED ON BY OLDER 
FELLAS BECAUSE I SEE OLDER MEN 
LOOKING AT THEM AND THEY ARE ONLY 
FIFTEEN AND SEVENTEEN AND IT IS CONCERNING 
WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SAID SUGGESTS 
THERE IS SOMETHING HARASSING ABOUT 
IT BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK OF IT IN 
A JOKY OR LIGHT LIGHT HEARTED WAY 
YOU THINK WHAT'S WRONG WHEN YOU 
THINK IT HAPPENING TO YOUR OWN 
DAUGHTER OR NIECE 
YOU LOOK AT IT FROM DIFFERENT ANGLE ANGLE WE HAD AN E. MAIL FROM A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD 
GIRL BUT SHE MADE THAT POINT 
THAT THE YOUNGER YOU ARE AND IT 
MAKES IT DIFFICULT MAYBE FEELING 
LACKING IN CONFIDENCE ANYWAY BINGO 
SOMEONE DOES THAT TO YOU IT IS 
JUST WHAT YOU DON'T WANT 
IT IS DIFFERENT IF YOU ARE FEELING 
VULNERABLE AND NOT TEENAGE GIRLS 
THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT THEY 
ARE BODY CONSCIOUS AND THE SMALLEST 
COMMENT CAN REALLY SORT OF UPSET 
THEM AND CAUSE AND REALLY MAKE THEM 
THEM FEEL BAD ABOUT THEMSELVES BUT 
I MEAN IN TERMS OF I'M SAYING WHEN 
I'M SAYING IT IT CAN ABGOOD THING 
IS WHEN IT IS IN A FUN LIGHT 
HEARTED NON THREATENING WAY AND 
NOT DONE TO PEOPLE THAT ARE IT IS 
NOT NOT GOING TO BE TAKEN IN A 
LIGHT HEARTED WAY 
CRAIG JANET E. MAILED MORE 
OFFENSIVE IS THE LANGUAGE WE HEAR 
FROM BUILDING SITES AND WHY ARE WE 
AFRAID OF ADDRESSING THAT WE HAVE 
HAD A CONSIDERATE BUILDERS SCHEME 
FOR YEARS ARE YOU ARE YOU SEEING 
THAT ADDRESSED 
I HAVEN'T SEEN MANY 
CHANGES ADDRESSING IN WHAT YOU CAN 
AND CAN'T SAY ON SITE THAT IS 
OFFENSIVE IF PEOPLE ARE SHOUTING 
OFF SCAFFOLDING TO YOUNG LADIES 
GOING PAST THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE 
THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF THE 
PROGRAMME PROGRAMME BREAKFAST IS HERE ACROSS THE 
WEEKEND YOU'RE HAVING A WEEKEND 
OFF AND BEN BEN GEOGHEGAN WILL BE 
JOINING ME TOMORROW AND ON MONDAY

FOR NOW HAVE LOVELY DAY 
HE'S OUT THERE BURNING THROUGH TIME 
FACING A THOUSAND DANGERS ACROSS THE STARS AND NEVER GIVING UP
