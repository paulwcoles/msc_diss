GUSLING CARS IS INTRODUCING A 
CHARGE FOR PARENTS DROPPING OFF 
THEIR CHILDREN AT THE SCHOOL GATE 
DRIVERS IN RICHMOND COULD HAVE TO 
PAY SEVENTY FIVE FOR A YEARLY PERMIT 
NO SIGN OF THE CAR TODAY ON AL SUNNY 
AFTERNOON IN RICHMOND BUT THE 
ISSUE OF BEING CHARGED TO USE ONE 
TO DROP YOUR KIDS OFF AT SCHOOL WAS 
STILL ON PARENTS' MINDS 
I THINK IT'S A SHAME THAT 
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE CENTRED 
AROUND TRYING TO PENALISE PEOPLE 
FOR SOMETHING THESE DAYS RATHER 
THAN PROVIDE THEM WITH SOME KIND OF 
INCENTIVE IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY SEEMS 
TO BE THE WRONG WAY ABOUT GOING 
ABOUT ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO USE 
THEIR CARS LESS 
AT THE LOCAL SUPERMARKET THERE 
WERE PLENTY OF PARENTS STOCKING UP 
FOR THE WEEK AHEAD MANY THINKING 
IT MIGHT NOT BE SUCH A BAD IDEA 
I THINK YOU SHOULD DISCOURAGE 
CHILDREN FROM BEING DRIVEN TO 
SCHOOL AND DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM 
DRIVING GAS GUZZLING CARS I DON'T 
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT 
THE COUNCIL 
HAS ALREADY HIT CAR DRIVERS WITH 
STIFF PENALTIES FOR HIGH EMISSION 
VEHICLES THEY DENY THIS IS ANOTHER 
TAX ON DRIVERS SAYING IT'S NEEDED 
TO KEEP SCHOOLS SAFE AND ENCOURAGE 
MORE SUSTAINABLE METHODS OF 
TRANSPORT TRANSPORT IT'S NOT A TAX IT'S A CHARGE 
RELATED TO CO TWO EMISSIONS SOME 
PARENTS WILL BE CHARGED ZERO THOSE 
WITH THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF C. O. TWO 
EMISSIONS WILL BE CHARGED SEVENTY FIVE THE THE SCHEME WILL START IN SEPTEMBER AND 
IF IT'S A SUCCESS OTHER LONDON 
BOROUGHS MAY FOLLOW SUIT 
FIREFIGHTERS ARE CLEANING UP AFTER 
A SIX HOUR BLAZE AT A KOLYARD IN

IN LINE WITH THE TRAIN AND HAVE A 
SUNDAY OUT

PICCADILLY LINES EACH TRAIN HAD
