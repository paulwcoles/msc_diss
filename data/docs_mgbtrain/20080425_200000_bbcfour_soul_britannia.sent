HEY THERE 
SOUL NOW DESCRIBES A WEALTH OF CONTEMPORARY BRITISH MUSIC 
WHEN I THINK OF GRIME TWO STEP DRUM AND BASS JUNGLE 
ALL THE SOUNDS THAT HAVE COME OUT SOONER OR LATER 
IF YOU TRACE THE LINE BACK 
YOU'RE GONNA END UP AT SOUL MUSIC IT'S THAT SIMPLE 
THE REASON BEING 
SOUL IS NOT ONLY 
A TECHNICAL GENRE THAT YOU PUT IN A BOX MARKED SOUL 
SOUL IS AN ATTITUDE 
THROUGH THE DECADES 
BRITISH SOUL HAS REFLECTED SOCIAL TENSIONS AND INSPIRED CHANGES 
DURING THE TIME THAT I WAS IN THE EIGHTIES MAKING THE MUSIC MYSELF 
I ABSOLUTELY LOATHED THE CULTURE THAT WAS BEING BUILT AROUND ME 
HAVING THATCHER AS A FOIL WAS INCREDIBLY INSPIRING 
SOON I'LL TAKE AWAY THESE CHAINS THAT ARE BINDING ME 
SOUL ATTRACTED A FANATICAL FOLLOWING OF FASHIONS AND FANS 
WHO HAD HELPED LEAD IT INTO THE MAINSTREAM IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
IT CHANGED EVERYTHING THE WAY WE DANCE THE WAY WE LOOK 
THE WAY WE LOOK AT THINGS OBVIOUSLY WHAT WE LISTEN TO 
AND I THINK IT'S FOR A LOT OF OUR GENERATION 
IT'S JUST INSIDE US NOW WE'RE INTERWOVEN WITH IT 
I COLLECTED A LOT OF RECORDS 
SOUL MUSIC OF COURSE 
SOUL MUSIC HAS THE WHOLE PACKAGE 
BLACK MUSIC WAS RUBBING OFF ON ME IN WALES IT WAS VERY INSPIRATIONAL 
YOU WANTED TO DO THAT I DID ANYWAY 
IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES SOUL SINGERS FROM MEMPHIS 
ENTHRALLED US WITH THEIR RAW EMOTIONAL POWER 
WHEN YOU WATCHED THESE PEOPLE THEY WERE SO EXCITING 
I CRIED HOW CAN YOU FAIL TO BE MOVED BY THIS MUSIC 
HOW CAN YOU NOT BE MOVED BY A BEAUTIFUL BLACK VOICE 
THE SOUL AND THE RAW POWER OF IT ALL 
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A WHITE OR A BLACK PERSON 
IT'S ACTUALLY SOMEONE WHO IS SINGING TO PENETRATE YOUR SOUL 
SOMEONE THAT SINGS THAT MOVES YOU 
THAT IS WHAT YOU CALL A CLASSIC SOUL VOICE 
ALONG WITH THE VOICES OF BLACK AMERICA 
OUR OWN CARIBBEAN AND AFRICAN IMMIGRANTS STIRRED THE FIRST INGREDIENTS OF BRITISH SOUL 
WHEN OUR PARENTS ARRIVED IN BRITAIN IN THE FIFTIES 
THAT THE LEGACY THAT OUR PARENTS WAS PLANTING WOULD BE 
SO WEIGHTY AND SO SIGNIFICANT 
AS TO CHANGE THE ENTIRE FACE OF GREAT BRITAIN 
FOR EVER 
THE CULTURE OF THESE NEW BRITISH CITIZENS AND EQUALLY IMPORTANT THE SOUL RECORDS ARRIVING FROM AMERICA 
WOULD EVENTUALLY COMBINE TO TRANSFORM THIS COUNTRY 
BUT OUR MOST EXOTIC MUSICAL POST WAR TONIC WERE THE LATIN DANCE BANDS IN LONDON'S SEDATE SUPPER CLUBS 
MAINSTREAM SOCIETY WHAT YOU WERE GETTING WAS LIKE THE CONVENTIONAL 
REALLY PRE WAR ENTERTAINMENT ONLY WRITTEN IN A FIFTIES STYLE 
AND YOU'D HAVE SOME SINGER 
SINGING THE SONGS STRAIGHT WITH NO EMBELLISHMENT 
GIVING IT EVERYTHING 
THEY CALL IT THE MAYFAIR MAMBO 
IT'S A DANCE 
WE USED TO RIDICULE PEOPLE LIKE THAT 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE 
THE STYLE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT EDGE 
BUT THERE WAS A GENERATION BEFORE ME THAT HAD SETTLED FOR THAT LIFESTYLE 
THE TWO WEEK HOLIDAY THE NINE TO FIVE JOB 
THE LITTLE CAR THE TRIPS TO THE SEASIDE 
AND WHILST THAT WAS ALL VERY NICE IT WASN'T WHAT WE WANTED 
ENGLAND WAS PRETTY DAMN BORING DURING THOSE YEARS 
THE FORTIES AND THE FIFTIES THERE WASN'T MUCH GOING ON 
SO AS CHILDREN WE HAD TO LOOK FOR OTHER FORMS OF EXCITEMENT 
LIKE UNEXPLODED BOMBS THAT WERE LEFT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
FROM WORLD WAR TWO 
LET NO OTHER HOLD YOUR CHARMS 
IF MY DREAMS SHOULD ALL COME TRUE 
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A HUNGER 
I THINK IT MUST HAVE COME FROM MAYBE MUSICAL SUPPRESSION 
THIS OLD HOUSE IS GETTING SHAKY 
THIS OLD HOUSE IS GETTING OLD 
WARTIME AND AFTER THE WAR 
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A LOT OF MUSIC THAT WAS NOT MEANT TO BE EMOTIONAL 
BECAUSE IT WAS A KIND OF ESCAPE AND A COVER UP SOMEHOW 
THAT I GUESS MUSIC WAS MEANT TO MAKE YOU JOLLY 
WHAT DO YOU WANT IF YOU DON'T WANT MONEY 
WHAT DO YOU WANT IF YOU DON'T WANT GOLD 
POP MUSIC TO ME WAS EXACTLY THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY MEAN THAT MUCH 
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ON THE RADIO PROGRAMMES LIKE 
SATURDAY CLUB AND THAT AND THEY'D HAVE LIVE BANDS ON THAT 
SAY WHAT YOU WANT 
SO YOU'D HAVE AN INTERVAL WITHIN THE JAZZ SHOW 
WHERE LONNIE DONEGAN WOULD SIT DOWN SWITCH YOU OVER FROM BANJO 
FROM THE DUNK DUNK DUNK DUNK TO THE GUITAR 
LET THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL SHINE ITS LIGHT ON ME 
LET THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL SHINE ITS LIGHT ON ME 
LET THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL SHINE ITS LIGHT ON ME 
YOU KNOW AND THEN WE'D SAY WHAT'S THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL 
WHAT'S THIS THING ABOUT SHINE A LIGHT ON ME 
SO WE'D DO SOME RESEARCH 
AND WE'D REALISE THAT IT WAS ALL THIS MYTHOLOGY WRAPPED UP IN THE MUSIC 
THIS MYTHOLOGY WAS CARRIED HERE 
IN THE HOLDS OF TRANSATLANTIC CARGO SHIPS 
EAGERLY AWAITED BY YOUNG WHITE ENTHUSIASTS SOLDIERS FROM AMERICAN BASES 
AND THE CARIBBEAN COMMUNITY FOR THEIR WEEKEND PARTIES 
ALL OF THEM ADDICTED TO BLACK R. AND AMP B. MUSIC 
THE SOUND SYSTEMS THAT COMPETED AND PLAYED THE LATEST R. AND AMP B. IMPORTS 
WOULD CONTINUE TO BE A CRUCIAL ELEMENT OF OUR HOME GROWN SOUL 
THE SOUND SYSTEM WAS VERY IMPORTANT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BLACK BRITISH SOUL 
THAT WAS OUR PLATFORM REALLY 
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE OUR OWN LOCAL RADIO STATION 
BRINGING IN ALL THE NEWS FROM WHAT WAS GOING ON ABROAD 
EVERYBODY GETTING TOGETHER AND EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT HAVING A GOOD TIME 
YOU'VE GOTTA WORK WORK WORK IT DADDY 
WORK WORK WORK IT DADDY 
SOME WHITE SOUL OBSESSIVES LIKE MICK JAGGER AND GEORGIE FAME 
CAME TO BUY THEIR RECORDS FROM THE MOST POWERFUL JAMAICAN D. J. 
I BECAME IN THE SOUND SYSTEM 
YOU KNOW THAT'S COS I GOT THE BEST RECORDS 
COUNT SUCKLE HAD THE BEST RECORD COLLECTION OF ANYBODY I'VE EVER KNOWN 
SUCKLE WAS IMPORTING ALL THE STUFF FROM MEMPHIS 
AND HE ALSO PLAYED GREAT BLUE NOTE JAZZ RECORDS 
AND HE ALSO HAD ALL THE LATEST RECORDS FROM JAMAICA 
SO IF YOU WENT DOWN SUCKLE'S PLACE YOU'D HEAR EVERYTHING 
ANYWHERE I PLAYED ON A SATURDAY NIGHT IT WAS TWO THOUSAND TO THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE 
SO EVERYBODY KNOW HEAR OF COUNT SUCKLE 
I USED TO STEAL RECORDS FROM SUCKLE AFTER HE PLAYED IT ON HIS SOUND SYSTEM 
I SAID I'VE GOT TO HAVE THAT 
AND THEN THEY WOULD PLAY SOME GREAT LOUIS PRIMA 
WHO WAS A WONDERFUL STEPPING STONE BETWEEN BASIC ROCK'N'ROLL AND JAZZ 
UP A LAZY RIVER WHERE THE OLD MILL RUN 
MEET YOU LAZY RIVER IN THE NOON DAY SUN 
LOUIS PRIMA WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US AS YOUNG ROCK'N'ROLL MUSICIANS 
BECAUSE ALONG WITH RAY CHARLES THEY HELPED YOU TO CROSS THAT BRIDGE 
INTO THE BIG WIDE WORLD OF REAL MUSIC BLUES RHYTHM AND BLUES 
AND EVENTUALLY JAZZ 
CRAZY LAZY RIVER 
RIVER 
CRAZY RIVER THE LAZY RIVER 
I WAS INTERESTED IN THE SCAT SINGING THAT'S WHAT KIND OF 
THE PART OF IT THAT I PICKED UP ON 
AND I STILL DO AND A LOT OF THE WAY I SING 
WAS BASED ON THAT WAS BASED ON THE EARLY SCAT SINGING 
YOU BETTER STOP THE THINGS YOU DO 
I AIN'T LYIN' 
NO I AIN'T LYIN' 
SAY I CAN'T STAND IT 
VAN MORRISON'S FATHER WAS A SHIPYARD WORKER IN BELFAST 
WHO AMASSED A RARE COLLECTION OF IMPORTED AMERICAN MUSIC 
MY FATHER HAD THIS RECORD COLLECTION 
BUT HE HAD MORE LIKE THE JAZZ RECORDS 
AND UM 
LEAD BELLY AND UM 
MAHALIA JACKSON STUFF LIKE THAT 
I WAS THE ONE THAT GOT INTO THE R. AND AMP B. SOUL 
I BOUGHT THE FORTY FIVES 
AND THE L. P.'S MYSELF 
SO THAT WASN'T HIS COLLECTION THAT WAS MY COLLECTION 
I STARTED TO HEAR THINGS AND BUY RAY CHARLES FORTY FIVES 
AND YOU KNOW CAME AT IT THROUGH THE BLUES ANGLE TO BEGIN WITH 
RHYTHM AND BLUES 
THERE WAS ALL THIS MIXTURE OF STUFF 
BABY PLEASE DON'T GO 
BABY PLEASE DON'T GO 
BABY PLEASE DON'T GO DOWN TO NEW ORLEANS 
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU SO BABY PLEASE DON'T GO 
I STARTED VERY EARLY I STARTED IN THE GAME 
AT FIFTEEN OR SOMETHING 
SO I STARTED BEFORE A LOT OF BRITISH ROCK STARS 
I WAS ALREADY GOING BEFORE THAT AND ABSORBING THIS STUFF 
BEFORE THE BRITISH BLUES SCENE HAPPENED 
BEFORE I BE YOUR DOG BEFORE I BE YOUR DOG 
VAN MORRISON WOULD LATER STAR IN THE SHOW THAT WAS A MUST 
FOR ALL YOUNG R. AND AMP B. HOPEFULS 
KNOW HOW I FEEL RIGHT NOW 
MY BABY LEAVIN' ON THAT MIDNIGHT TRAIN 
AND I'M CRYING 
BABY PLEASE DON'T GO OH BABY PLEASE DON'T GO 
BABY PLEASE DON'T GO DOWN TO NEW ORLEANS 
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU SO BABY PLEASE DON'T GO 
I WANTED TO KIND OF BE THE WHITE PEOPLE MIMICKING THE BLUES 
OR A BLACK PERSON FROM WAY BACK DOING THE BLUES 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A BLACK EXPERIENCE 
IT'S UM 
TO ME IT WAS THE WHITE WORKING CLASS EXPERIENCE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS 
YOU KNOW 
THAT WAS MY VERSION OF IT 
THAT'S THE ONLY THING I COULD RELATE TO 
I THOUGHT THE WHITE WORKING CLASS SITUATION WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF WHATEVER THE BLACK SITUATION WAS 
BUT THIS SYMPATHY FOR BLACK CULTURE WASN'T COMMON IN FIFTIES' BRITAIN 
WHITE TEENAGERS IN MIXED AREAS LIKE LONDON'S NOTTING HILL 
DIDN'T ALWAYS GEL WITH THE NEW IMMIGRANTS 
WHEN YOU WENT TO TWICKENHAM THEY NEVER SEE A BLACK MAN DOWN THERE BEFORE 
SO EVERY STREET EVERY WINDOW THEY COME OUT 
YOU LAUGH ABOUT THESE THINGS TODAY 
EVERYBODY COME OUT AND THEY'RE LIKE THAT 
IT'S A BLACK MAN IT'S A BLACK MAN 
ALL THE KIDS MUMMY THERE'S A BLACK MAN 
WHEN THERE WAS FIRST BLACK PEOPLE MOVING IN WE WERE AFRAID OF THEM 
THEY LOOKED COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THE BLOKES HAD BIG BAGGY TROUSERS 
IN THE FIFTIES AND BIG HATS YOU KNOW THEY WERE DIFFERENT 
WE WERE LIKE WHO ARE THEY 
LOCAL TENSIONS INCREASED 
AS THE CARIBBEAN COMMUNITY BECAME MORE VISIBLE 
AND THEIR HOUSE PARTIES THREATENED TO DISRUPT THE TRADITIONAL BRITISH WEEKEND 
STILL WE COULDN'T GET A HALL THEY WOULDN'T RENT US A HALL 
SO WHAT WE USED TO DO IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
YOU'D TAKE THE BED AND THE FURNITURE 
AND EVERYTHING IN THE ROOM 
WE'D TAKE ALL THE FURNITURE OUT 
AND WE'D BE DANCING IN TWO ROOMS 
FOR ME WHEN I GET HOME 
AND THE NEIGHBOURS START TELLING THE POLICE 
THEY CAN'T SLEEP WITH THIS MUMBO JUMBO MUSIC 
THE POLICE START TO RAID US 
TAKE AWAY OUR EQUIPMENT 
AND THEY START THROWING PETROL BOMBS 
THEY START TO GO BACK THIS IS HOW THE RIOTS STARTED AT NOTTING HILL GATE 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT TENSIONS ERUPTED INTO THE FIRST NOTTING HILL RIOTS 
WHERE RIGHT WING TEDDY BOYS ATTACKED THE WEST INDIAN COMMUNITY 
ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK 
THERE WAS A PETROL BOMB COMING THROUGH THE HOUSE 
THE HOUSE WAS ON FIRE SO WE TRIED TO RUN TO THE DOOR 
AND THERE WAS ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE OUT THERE 
WHITE PEOPLE BURN THE NIGGERS KILL THE NIGGERS 
SEND THEM BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY 
THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE WE CAN'T GO THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR THEY WERE OUT TO KILL 
WE STAYED ON THE ROOF TILL THE POLICE COME 
THAT'S HOW THE RACE RIOTS STARTED 
BUT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY 
WHITE TEENAGERS FELL IN LOVE WITH BLACK CULTURE 
AS THEY SOUGHT TO ESCAPE THE POST WAR POVERTY OF THEIR PARENTS 
MY GRANDFATHER WAS A SLAVE 
WHAT ELSE COULD YOU CALL IT 
HE WAS DOWN A MINE 
IN FIVE FEET SEAMS SOMETIMES UP TO HIS WAIST IN WATER 
AND GOT PAID VERY LITTLE FOR IT 
HAD TO BUY HIS OWN EQUIPMENT 
THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS A SHOWER AT THE END OF THE DAY 
SO HE CAME HOME BLACK 
AND HE'D GO STRAIGHT TO THE PUB 
AND ALL OF THE WORKERS IN THE PUBS THE MINERS IN THE PUB WOULD BE BLACK 
AND ER DRINKING THEIR PINTS 
WHICH WOULD WASH THE BLACK AWAY FROM THEIR LIPS 
I WAS QUITE AT EASE WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE BLACK 
THEY COULD WASH IT OFF AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT WAS THE ADVANTAGE 
IN NEWCASTLE BACK IN FIFTY EIGHT FIFTY NINE 
WE THOUGHT WE'D DISCOVERED THE MOTHER LODE OF SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL AND SECRET 
I HEARD THESE VOICES IN THE DISTANCE 
AND YOU COULD HEAR 
THE TAMBOURINES GOING AND YEAH YEAH 
AND WE JUST SAT IN SILENCE AND LISTENED TO THIS CHURCH MEETING UNTIL IT WAS FINISHED 
FROM THAT POINT ON I REALISED THAT ALL GREAT SOUL SINGERS 
UM CAME FROM THE CHURCH 
SOUL IS JUST 
A TALENT FOR SHOUTING OUT TRUTH 
I'M A ROADRUNNER BABY 
I GOT A STROKE ON AND CAN'T GO WRONG 
THAT AWAKENING WOULD LEAD ERIC BURDON TO HIS OWN BRAND OF R. AND AMP B. 
GOT A STROKE AND I CAN'T GO WRONG 
PUT A TOOTHBRUSH IN MY HAND 
HAVE TO BE TRAVELLIN' ON 
YEAH 
I'M A ROADRUNNER BABY CAN'T KEEP UP WITH ME 
I'M A ROADRUNNER MAN 
CAN'T KEEP UP WITH ME 
COME ON LET'S HAVE A RACE 
BABY BABY YOU WILL SEE 
THERE WE GO 
THERE WERE SECTIONS OF MY HOME TOWN 
COMING OUT OF THE NEW ORLEANS JAZZ CLUB ON A SATURDAY NIGHT 
COVERED IN SWEAT AND THEN WALKING HOME IN THE RAIN 
WITH MY DUFFLE COAT HOOD ON IN THE FREEZING COLD RAIN 
AND GOING DOWN TO THE RIVERSIDE 
I'D IMAGINE I WAS IN NEW ORLEANS 
MY MIND WAS IN NEW ORLEANS LONG BEFORE I EVER GOT THERE 
I KNEW THE PHYSICAL LAYOUT OF THE CITY 
I KNEW ALL OF THE PLAYERS IN THE BAND 
AND WE TRIED OUR BEST TO EMULATE THEIR LIFESTYLES 
AND IT HELPED US BREAK THE MOULD 
THAT WE GREW UP IN IN ENGLAND 
I'M A ROADRUNNER BABY 
CAN'T KEEP UP WITH ME 
YEAH 
COME ON LET'S HAVE A RACE BABY 
BABY BABY YOU WILL SEE 
I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN A BRICK BOX 
AND LOOK UP AND SEE SOME BLUE SKY 
EVEN THE DEEP ROOTED SOUNDS OF THE RHONDDA VALLEY 
WERE ABOUT TO BE JOLTED INTO THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
I THINK THAT IN A COAL MINING AREA 
THAT MUSIC IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF LIFE 
AND THE SAME THING IN THE COTTON FIELDS IF YOU LIKE 
OF THE SOUTHERN STATES OF AMERICA 
THE BLACK PEOPLE THE THING THAT LIFTED THEM UP AND KEPT THEM ALIVE THROUGH HARDSHIP 
IS MUSIC AND SINGING 
THAT'S WHAT IT DID FOR ME AND EVERYBODY THAT LIVED IN THAT ENVIRONMENT 
I REMEMBER BEING IN SCHOOL 
AND I SANG THE LORD'S PRAYER 
AND THE MUSIC TEACHER SAID TO ME 
WHY ARE YOU SINGING THIS LIKE A NEGRO SPIRITUAL 
I SAID I HAVE NO IDEA MAYBE I HEARD MAHALIA JACKSON SING IT 
I MUST HAVE HEARD SOMEBODY SINGING THE LORD'S PRAYER 
THAT PLAYED WITH THE MELODY A BIT YOU KNOW WAS MORE FREE WITH IT 
AND WHEN I STARTED DRINKING IN PUBS AND CLUBS 
BLACK PEOPLE FROM CARDIFF WOULD COME AND HEAR ME SING 
AND WONDERED ABOUT ME COS I HAVE CURLY HAIR 
THEY USED TO SAY YOU MIGHT BE PASSING FOR WHITE YOU 
I THINK IT'S TO DO WITH THE TONE OF MY VOICE AND THE LOVE OF LISTENING TO BLACK SINGERS 
ONE MORE TIME ONE MORE TIME 
ONE MORE TIME ONE MORE TIME 
OH ONE MORE TIME 
WHAT'D I SAY WHAT'D I SAY TELL ME WHAT'D I SAY 
WHAT'D I SAY WHAT'D I SAY BABY 
WHAT'D I SAY WHAT'D I SAY HONEY 
WHAT'D I SAY TELL ME WHAT'D I SAY 
TELL ME WHAT'D I SAY 
THE RAW POWER AND SEXUALITY OF AMERICAN SOUL PERFORMERS 
MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION ON BRITISH FANS 
TELL ME WHAT'D I SAY 
TELL ME WHAT'D I SAY 
IRONICALLY THOSE SAME VOICES WERE LARGELY UNHEARD BY WHITE TEENAGERS IN THEIR OWN HOMELAND 
IN AMERICA THE SEGREGATION THAT WAS GOING ON THERE 
BLACK PEOPLE ONLY GOT PLAYED ON BLACK RADIO STATIONS 
SO A LOT OF WHITE PEOPLE IN AMERICA WERE NOT HEARING THOSE SONGS 
HERE IN THIS COUNTRY WE NEVER HAD THAT PROBLEM 
SO I THINK WE WERE MORE OPEN TO AND INFLUENCED 
THAN WHITE AMERICA WAS 
IT WOULD BE BRITISH PERFORMERS OVER THE NEXT DECADE 
WHO WOULD CARRY BLACK MUSIC BACK TO AMERICA 
AS PART OF THE BRITISH INVASION 
MEANWHILE IN CITIES ACROSS THE U. K. 
TEENAGE GROUPS WERE INVENTING NEW REBELLIOUS SOUND SCAPES 
WITH ECHOES OF BLACK AMERICAN R. AND AMP B. 
DANG A LANG A DANG A DOOWAH DANG A LANG A DANG A DOOWAH 
I IDENTIFIES TOTALLY WITH THE AMERICAN STREET CORNER BANDS 
BECAUSE YOU'D REALISE RIGHT AWAY 
THAT THESE WERE POOR GUYS THE SAME AS US 
THEY WERE TRYING TO DO THE SAME THINGS AS US 
AND I WANTED TO EMULATE THEM 
I WAS ALSO EXPOSED TO HIGHLIFE MUSIC WHICH WAS OBVIOUSLY MY DAD'S MUSIC 
MY DAD WAS A GUITARIST AND HE PLAYED IN SEVERAL HIGHLIFE BANDS IN AFRICA 
AND HE HAD THIS ACETAPE AND IT WAS CALLED AMOO'S BAND 
AND THE MUSIC SOUNDED VERY WEIRD TO ME YOU KNOW 
AND THEN WHEN I WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN 
AND SORT OF LIKE FOUND AN IDENTITY AS A BLACK KID NOW 
AND BASICALLY 
WE'D DONE THE USUAL THING THAT WORKING CLASS KIDS IN A VERY POOR ENVIRONMENT WILL DO 
WE WENT LOOKING FOR TROUBLE AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
AND THE GUYS I WAS WITH WE'D LISTEN TO THE STREET CORNER AMERICAN BANDS 
ALL THE DOO WOP GROUPS 
LIKE THE PLATTERS THE DEL VIKINGS 
THE OLYMPICS ALL THEM EARLY BANDS WE WERE EXPOSED TO 
AND WE USED TO IMAGINE IMAGES OF THESE GUYS STANDING ON THE CORNER 
GIRLS ALL ROUND THEM AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
SINGING WITH NO MUSIC AND WE'D PUT DOO WOP RECORDS ON 
PUT OUR EARS TO THE DANSETTE SPEAKERS 
AND TRY AND GET OF THE PART 
AND BASICALLY THAT'S HOW IT REALLY BEGAN 
I COULD WRITE A STORY 
OF HOW WE MET 
SO THE WORLD WOULD NEVER FORGET SHANG A LANG A WOP 
THE CHANCE PERFORMED IN THE LIVERPOOL CAVERN 
AT THE INVITATION OF A LOCAL UPCOMING BAND CALLED THE BEATLES 
WHO EVEN BACKED THEM ON STAGE 
THIS GROUP OF BLACK TEENAGERS FROM TOXTETH 
LEARNED A LOT ABOUT AMERICAN SOUL AND R. AND AMP B. FROM THE FAB FOUR 
WHO WERE ALSO AVID RECORD COLLECTORS 
THE BEATLES USED TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY'D LIKE TO HEAR US SING 
THEY WERE HEAVILY INTO SORT OF AMERICAN R. AND AMP B. 
THE WHOLE MERSEYBEAT SCENE AS IT WAS THEN 
WAS BUILT UP ON THE AMERICAN R. AND AMP B. SCENE 
THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE ARE FREE 
BUT YOU CAN GIVE IT TO THE BIRDS AND BEES I NEED MONEY 
THAT'S WHAT I WANT GIVE ME MONEY 
THE NATTY FASHIONS THE NEW BRITISH BAND SPORTED ON STAGE WERE MIRRORED BY THEIR TEENAGE FANS 
WHO WERE KNOWN AS MODS OR MODERNISTS 
IT GIVES ME SUCH A THRILL 
FOR ME MOD IS THE CORE IDEA 
BEHIND THE WHOLE YOUTH CULTURE CAPER 
AND THAT EXTRAORDINARY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MUSIC OF BLACK AMERICA 
AND THE LIFESTYLES OF WORKING CLASS ENGLAND 
MODS WERE PREDATED BY TEDDY BOYS AND THE TEDDY BOYS ARE GREAT 
BUT THEY WANTED TO STAY IN THEIR PLACE 
THEY WERE VERY KIND OF BROWN ALE AND DOWN THE PUB ON FRIDAY NIGHT 
THEY WERE RIGHT WING 
AT THAT TIME THEY WERE STARTING TO SPLIT BETWEEN MODS AND ROCKERS 
KIDS DRESSING IN DIFFERENT WAYS 
SO I CAME TO LONDON FROM CARDIFF 
THERE I WAS WITH THE JEANS AND LEATHER JACKET 
AND BRYLCREEMED HAIR 
DOWN IN THE FRONT AND BACK ON THE SIDES 
SO WE DID CHILLS AND FEVER 
WHICH WAS MORE OF A SOUL MORE OF A RHYTHM AND BLUES RECORD 
THAN ROCK BUT WE TRIED TO MAKE A ROCK RECORD OUT OF IT 
WHEN YOU HOLD MY HAND AND TELL ME 
THAT I'M YOUR LOVELY MAN 
THE TEDDY BOY IMAGE THAT TOM JONES ADOPTED FOR HIS FIRST RECORDING 
WAS ALREADY A STYLE DINOSAUR 
ABOUT TO BE REPLACED BY THE FASHION HUNGRY MODS 
WHO'D RECENTLY ROUTED THEIR BRYLCREEMED RIVALS ON BRIGHTON BEACH 
BY NINETEEN SIXTY THREE THESE ROCKERS HAD PASSED THEIR SELL BY DATE 
AND RELUCTANTLY GAVE WAY TO THE NEW ORDER OF SELF STYLED MODERNISTS 
TO UNDERSTAND THE MOD MENTALITY YOU HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT POST WAR ENGLAND 
MODS WERE THE FIRST GENERATION 
OF TEENAGERS TO ACTUALLY BE BORN AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
AND THEY WERE BROUGHT UP IN A FAIRLY REPRESSED BRITAIN OF THE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
THINGS WERE VERY GRAVE 
VERY BLACK AND WHITE IN THOSE PRE BEATLES DAYS 
THOSE DARK AGES 
THOSE CHILDREN BASICALLY HAD NO IDENTITY OF THEIR OWN AT ALL 
AND THEY WOULD DRESS LIKE THEIR PARENTS WEAR THEIR HAIR LIKE THEIR PARENTS 
AND TO A CERTAIN DEGREE THEY WOULD EVEN LISTEN TO THE SAME RECORDS AS THEIR PARENTS 
WHEREAS THE MODS WERE UPTOWN 
THEY WERE SHARP 
THEY WERE REACHING OUT THEY WERE LOOKING TO CONTINENTAL EUROPE FOR THEIR STYLES 
AND THEY WERE LOOKING TO BLACK AMERICA FOR THEIR MUSIC AND THEIR DANCE STEPS 
THEY WERE LOOKING TO THE WEST INDIES FOR THE WAY THEY WALKED 
AND THAT MADE THEM VERY VERY SPECIAL 
IN THIS DULL 
KIND OF EARLY CLOSING ENGLAND 
THERE ARE WONDERFUL STORIES 
OF KIDS WALKING UP AND DOWN STREETS IN SOHO BEHIND FRENCH AND ITALIAN WAITERS 
DRAWING THE TROUSERS THEY WERE WEARING COS YOU COULDN'T GET THOSE IN ENGLAND 
OR GOING TO WATCH NEW WAVE MOVIES TAKING SARTORIAL NOTES 
ABOUT WHAT JEAN PAUL BELMONDO'S SHADES LOOKED LIKE 
YOU COULD GO FROM BEING SOME KIND OF ALSO RAN IN A CRAPPY SECONDARY SCHOOL 
TO BEING PRINCE OF THE CITY BECAUSE YOU'D GOT ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS CORRECT 
IT ALWAYS CAME DOWN TO TWO THINGS CLOTHES AND MUSIC 
AND THOSE TWO THINGS COULD ELEVATE YOU 
TO THAT STATUS OF BEING A FACE 
JUST SOMEONE EVERYBODY RECOGNISES AND KNOWS ABOUT 
YOU'VE GOT A REPUTATION YOU'RE COOL 
YOU'RE A MOD 
THAT COOL CARIBBEAN CLOTHING HAD ARRIVED IN THE SAME WORKING CLASS AREAS OF LONDON 
NOTTING HILL BRIXTON TOTTENHAM AS THE MODS LIVED IN 
WITH THEIR TROUSERS AN INCH ABOVE THEIR SHOES 
AND THEIR TRILBIES AT AN ACUTE ANGLE 
THESE JAMAICAN DUDES BECAME ROLE MODELS FOR WHITE BOYS WHO WANTED TO LOOK LIKE RUDEBOYS 
SO DON'T YOU HEAR ME 
WHOA WHOA WHOA 
YEAH 
IN THE EARLY SIXTIES MODS WERE ADOPTING NOT JUST THE FASHIONS FROM JAMAICA 
BUT ALSO THE NEW MUSIC FROM THAT ISLAND KNOWN AS SKA 
SKA WAS A DISTINCTIVELY JAMAICAN TAKE ON AMERICAN R. AND AMP B. 
BROUGHT HERE BY THE STYLE GURUS OF KINGSTON JAMAICA 
YEAH PRINCE BUSTER 
WE DRESSED IN A CERTAIN WAY PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T DRESS LIKE THAT 
WOULD NEVER GET A DANCE WITH A GIRL OR ANYTHING 
THEY WERE JUST CONSIDERED STUPID SILLY 
COS THIS WAS IT AS FAR AS WE WERE CONCERNED 
I WAS OBSESSED WITH FASHION 
I WAS OBSESSED WITH MUSIC WITH RECORDS THE NEW RECORD THE NEWEST THING 
AND IT BEING UNDERGROUND 
DRESSING AND DANCING WERE THE TWO THINGS THAT WERE COMPLETELY INTERTWINED 
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL ABOUT PERFORMANCE ALL ABOUT DISPLAY 
IMAGINE THE SHOCK WHEN YOU'RE STILL EATING POWDERED EGG 
AND THE PUBS STILL CLOSE AT ONE THOUSAND THIRTY 
AND EVERYTHING CLOSES AT THE WEEKENDS 
TO HAVE THESE BOYS RIDE AROUND ON SCOOTERS 
IN THE SHARPEST CLOTHES IMAGINABLE IMAGINE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE 
THE MOPED RIDING MODS WEREN'T JUST ADDICTED TO IMPORTED SKA FORTY FIVES 
THEY ADOPTED AS THEIR OWN A LIVE SEVEN PIECE BAND JUST ARRIVED FROM JAMAICA 
JIMMY JAMES AND THE VAGABONDS STARTED OUT WITH AN ALL BLACK FAN BASE 
BUT SOON BECAME A FAVOURITE OF THE MOD ARMY WHO LOVED THEIR GROOVE AND THEIR LOOK 
WHEN JIMMY JAMES AND THE VAGABONDS CAME ON STAGE 
EVERYBODY KNEW THAT WAS US 
COS WE DRESSED DIFFERENTLY FROM EVERYBODY ELSE 
AND WE WERE ALWAYS 
WE USE THE TERM SHARP LOOKING REALLY SMART 
SO THAT'S HOW WE WERE 
THE VAGABONDS TOURED THE WHOLE OF BRITAIN 
PLAYING THREE SHOWS A NIGHT STILL PART OF A MUSICAL UNDERGROUND 
DESPITE THEIR GROWING POPULARITY WITH THE WORKING CLASS BRITISH FANS 
OUR MOD FOLLOWING WAS HUGE 
WHEN YOU SAY LARGE IT WAS HUGE 
THOUSANDS 
WHEN WE DID PLACES LIKE BRIGHTON PIER 
THEY WERE CLOSING THE PLACE AT SEVEN O'CLOCK 
SHOUTING NO MORE NO MORE 
IT WAS HUGE THE MUSIC DID IT THE MUSIC BROUGHT THOSE PEOPLE 
IT TASTES SO SWEET IT'S A GOOD GOOD FEELING 
SETS YOUR HEART A REELIN' 
EVERYBODY CLAP YOUR HANDS 
STOMP THEM FEET 
EVERYBODY NOW 
AIN'T LOVE GOOD AIN'T LOVE PROUD 
AIN'T LOVE GOOD AIN'T LOVE PROUD 
JIMMY JAMES BECAME THE VOICE OF THE MODS 
TAKING IN SKA R. AND AMP B. AND SOUL 
PEOPLE CLASS ME AS A SOUL SINGER WELL TO ME 
IT'S JUST THE WAY I FEEL A SONG AND THE WAY I WOULD EXPRESS THAT SONG 
I SUPPOSE THAT'S WHY THEY SAY THAT 
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT BUT IT HAS TO COME FROM 
WHEREVER IT'S COMING FROM IT'S DEEP DOWN INSIDE YOU KNOW 
YOU CAN GET THAT FROM THE DIAPHRAGM AND THE THROAT NO WAY IT HAS TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE 
AIN'T LOVE GOOD AIN'T LOVE PROUD 
THE MOD SCENE BECAME VERY FASHIONABLE 
AND THAT HELPED TO MAKE THAT TIME SUCH AN EXCITING TIME 
BECAUSE THE MUSIC BROKE DOWN THE INSULARITY 
OF THE BRITISH POPULATION 
SO THE WHOLE CULTURALLY SEXUALLY WHATEVER YOU WANT TO NAME IT 
GRADUALLY JUST DISAPPEARED AND THE MUSIC MADE THAT HAPPEN 
IT WAS ALSO HAPPENING IN THE CLUBS OF LONDON'S SOHO 
WHERE LOCAL TEENAGERS WERE MIXING WITH WEST INDIANS AND AFRICANS AFTER WORKING HOURS 
IN THE CLUBS IS WHERE I FIRST LEARNED 
TO TALK TO BLACK PEOPLE TO HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH BLACK PEOPLE 
WHO WERE MY FRIENDS 
PEOPLE I WATCHED FOOTBALL MATCHES WITH AS WELL LATER ON 
PEOPLE WHOSE PARTIES I WENT TO 
THEY CAME TO MY HOUSE AND LISTENED TO SOME MUSIC 
WE'D GO AND GET SOME SPLIFF TOGETHER 
IT WAS ABOUT OVERCOMING THOSE BARRIERS BY BEING YOUR OWN PERSON 
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT 
GETTING RESPECT FROM YOUR PEERS 
THE FLAMINGO CLUB IN WARDOUR STREET WAS ON WEEKENDS ANYWAY 
A TWENTY FOUR HOUR NON STOP CLUB 
YOU COULD GO IN AT THREE A M. 
AND IT WOULD JUST BE STARTING TO GEAR UP 
AND IT WAS 
IT WAS TOUGH GETTING IN IT WAS TOUGH GETTING OUT IT WAS PACKED 
WITH WEST INDIANS AND AFRICANS 
THAT WAS THE HOTTEST CLUB IN LONDON AS FAR AS LIVE MUSIC WAS CONCERNED 
AND A LOT OF BLACK PEOPLE USED TO GO IN THERE BECAUSE THEY KNEW 
THAT THERE WOULD BE SOUL MUSIC BEING PLAYED 
OUR TAKE THE BRITISH TAKE ON SOUL MUSIC BUT IT WAS SOUL MUSIC 
IS NOTHING BUT AN ACT I'M AT THE POINT OF NO RETURN 
AND FOR ME THERE'LL BE NO TURNING BACK 
GEORGIE FAME AND AMP THE BLUE FLAMES WERE DOWN THERE I REALLY LOVED THAT BAND 
IT WAS LIKE AN R. AND AMP B. BAND 
PLAYING RECORDS BESIDE A GROOVY HI FI 
I SAY YEH YEH THAT'S WHAT I SAY 
I SAY YEH YEH 
MY BABY LOVES ME SHE GETS ME FEELING SO FINE 
AND WHEN SHE LOVES ME SHE LET'S ME KNOW THAT SHE'S MINE 
AND WHEN SHE KISSES I FEEL THE FIRE GET HOT 
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE TRAINING GROUND FOR ME 
THAT'S WHERE I CUT MY TEETH AND STARTED LEARNING MY TRADE 
WE WERE PLAYING TWO LONG SETS A NIGHT FROM MIDNIGHT 
DOWN THE FLAMINGO GEORGIE FAME WAS LOVED 
HE'D START A TUNE THAT PEOPLE KNEW AND PEOPLE WOULD SHOUT OUT 
THEY'D GO YEAH NICE 
I WANT YOU ALL FOR MY OWN 
I THINK I'M READY TO LEAVE THOSE OTHERS ALONE 
NO NEED TO ASK ME IF EVERYTHING IS O. K. 
I GOT MY ANSWER THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY 
I SAY YEH YEH 
THAT'S WHAT I SAY I SAY YEH YEH 
THAT'S WHAT I SAY YEH YEH 
THE FLAMINGO WAS A VERY MIXED CLIENTELE FOR THE ALL NIGHT SESSIONS 
YOU'D GET JAMAICANS AND OTHER AFRO CARIBBEANS 
YOU'D GET AFRO AMERICAN G. I.'S ON A WEEKEND LEAVE 
FROM THE AIR BASES UP IN NORFOLK AND SUFFOLK 
WHY DIDN'T HE LET ME KNOW 
IT WAS A NICE LITTLE CLUB THE FLAMINGO 
THE FLAMINGO CLUB WAS A HAVEN FOR BLACK AMERICAN G. I.'S ON THE WEEKEND 
COMING FROM THE VARIOUS BASES AROUND THE U. K. AND 
THEY USED TO BRING RECORDS IN EVERY WEEK FOR US 
SAYING HAVE A LISTEN TO THIS YOU MIGHT LIKE THIS 
CAN YOU PLAY THIS FOR US OFF THIS RECORD 
SO IT STARTED TO OPEN UP VERY QUICKLY 
JUST A WALKING THE DOG 
COME ON BABY 
IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO WALK THE DOG 
IT WAS ON AMERICAN BASES ACROSS BRITAIN THAT MUSICIANS LIKE GEORGIE FAME 
FIRST ENCOUNTERED AN ALADDIN'S CAVE OF CONSUMER LUXURIES 
AND THE SOUL MUSIC BLACK U. S. SERVICEMEN HAD CARRIED ACROSS THE ATLANTIC 
YOU'D GO AND PLAY IN AN AMERICAN AIR FORCE BASE AND IT WAS LIKE ENTERING MARS 
IT WAS ANOTHER WORLD THEY HAD ICE 
THEY HAD JUKE BOXES THEY HAD ALL KINDS OF LUXURY FOOD ITEMS 
WE HAD RATIONING UNTIL GOD KNOWS WHEN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE OR SO 
SO IT WAS LIKE ENTERING ANOTHER WORLD 
WALKING THE DOG 
COME ON BABY 
IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO WALK YOUR DOG 
IF YOU'RE READY COME ON BABY 
ARE YOU READY 
IT WAS LIKE A MOVIE AND YOU WERE IN THAT MOVIE 
YOU WERE PART OF THAT MOVIE 
AND IF YOU WERE LUCKY YOU STARRED IN THAT MOVIE 
BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER AS LONG AS YOU WERE IN THE MOVIE AND WE WERE 
WALKING THE DOG 
AMERICAN FORCES RADIO OFFERED MUSIC THE B. B. C. HAD IGNORED FOR A DECADE 
A GENERATION BEGAN TO TASTE AND THEN IMITATE THE EXOTIC FRUITS OF IMPORTED AMERICAN MUSIC 
WE STARTED TO PLAY ON U. S. AIR FORCE BASES 
ON A FRIDAY OR SATURDAY NIGHT 
AND THEN WE'D PACK UP THE GEAR DRIVE TO LONDON 
AND START THE ALL NIGHTER AT THE FLAMINGO AT MIDNIGHT 
AND THE G. I.'S WOULD BE COMING DOWN WITH US 
SO THIS WAS IT WAS A TWO WAY STREET 
IT WAS HAPPENING ALL THE TIME 
THERE I WAS DOWN IN THE FLAMINGO CLUB MAN 
IT'S PACKED IT'S JUMPING 
IT'S HOT SWEATY AND THERE'S GEORGIE FAME PLAYING THE KEYBOARD 
BABY PLEASE DON'T GO DOWN TO NEW ORLEANS 
OH HE WAS IN IT 
GENO WAS A G. I. 
HE WAS STATIONED AT BENTWATERS IN SUFFOLK 
HE WAS ONE OF THE CATS THAT USED TO COME DOWN ON A WEEKEND AND SAY CAN I SING A SONG WITH THE BAND 
THEY TOOK A BREAK 
I WENT AND UM WENT IN THE BACK AND SAID I LOVE YOUR MUSIC MAN 
I SAID IS IT POSSIBLE I COULD JUMP UP AND HAVE A LITTLE SONG WITH YOU 
HE SAYS YEAH THAT SEEMS ALL RIGHT MAN HE SAYS DO YOU SING 
I SAID MY SISTER'S IN MARTHA AND THE VANDELLAS 
AND MY UNCLE'S WIFE IS DINAH WASHINGTON 
HE SAID DAMN O. K. COOL 
COURSE I'M LYING I WILL LIE RIGHT 
SO HE SAYS WE'VE GOT THIS G. I. TO COME UP HERE AND HIS NAME IS GENO WASHINGTON 
GIVE A BIG FLAMINGO ROUND OF APPLAUSE 
THEY WENT YEAH ALL RIGHT 
WHAT DO YOU WANT 
THAT SHE CAN'T GIVE 
HER TENDER LOVING 
I JUMPED IN THERE AND STARTED SINGING 
DANCING HAD PEOPLE CLAPPING AND JUMPING 
WHAT THAT WOMAN HAS DONE FOR ME 
IN THE MORNING SHE'S MY WATER 
IN THE EVENING SHE'S MY CUP OF TEA 
NOBODY KNOWS NOBODY KNOWS 
NOBODY KNOWS LIKE I KNOW 
YOU DON'T KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW 
YOU DON'T KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T BLAME YOU I DON'T BLAME YOU 
GENO WASHINGTON WAS THE GUY WHO FILLED THE GAP IN THE U. K. 
FOR HOME GROWN SOUL 
YOU KNOW GENO WASHINGTON WAS FOR THE TIME 
HE WAS THE BUSINESS AMONGST A CERTAIN SET OF PEOPLE 
GENO'S FIRST L. P. THOUGH PART OF THE MUSICAL UNDERGROUND 
SOLD TO TENS OF THOUSANDS 
THAT YEAR IT OUTSOLD SUCH HOUSEHOLD NAMES AS BOB DYLAN AND THE WHO 
THIS WAS PARTLY THANKS TO A NEW GENERATION OF YOUNG D. J.'S 
WHO'D BEGUN TRANSMITTING SOUL SOUNDS ACROSS THE U. K. 
FROM PIRATE RADIO SHIPS 
GENO AND HIS RAM JAM BAND RODE THIS NEW SOUL WAVE 
MICHAEL THE LOVER 
BABY 
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE 
BUT YOU CAN'T CONNECT 
DID YOU CONNECT IS THE QUESTION 
BECAUSE SOUL 
COMES FROM GOSPEL MUSIC 
IF SOMEONE SAYS YOU'RE VERY SOULFUL 
IT MEANS YOU TOUCH THE INNER SOUL OF THEM 
MICHAEL 
TOUCHING BLACK AMERICA 
MEANT BREAKING SOME DEEPLY HELD TABOOS 
FOR LOCAL GIRLS ATTRACTED TO THESE G. I.'S FAR FROM HOME 
THEIR SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS WERE MIRRORED IN THE SOULFUL MUSIC THEY LOVED 
THIS WAS LOVE 
CAPITAL L. AND THIS WAS ROMANCE AND ALL THOSE THINGS 
AND BOY DID THEY GET LAID ABSOLUTELY END ON END DAY IN DAY OUT 
IN THOSE DAYS BACK IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
BLACK MUSIC WAS ALWAYS CONSIDERED QUITE RISQUE 
AND SEXUALLY PROVOCATIVE 
AND THAT WAS QUITE EARTH SHATTERING IN THIS INHIBITED LAND OF OURS 
YOU MAKE MY HEART GO GIDDY UP 
YOU ARE AS SWEET AS CANDY 
AS COUPLE MIXED MORE OPENLY 
SO SKA MUSIC FROM JAMAICA BROKE OUT OF THE MUSICAL CLOSET 
AND CELEBRATED WITH ITS FIRST BRITISH NUMBER ONE 
BECAUSE IT WOULD GRIEVE ME 
MY HEART TOLD ME SO 
I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU 
MILLIE WAS THE FIRST SERIOUS SKA TUNE 
THAT WAS RECORDED ON THESE SHORES 
MY BOY LOLLIPOP 
THIS WAS THE BREAKING OF THE ICE SUDDENLY IT WAS POSSIBLE 
FOR A CARIBBEAN ACT REGGAE JAMAICAN 
TO BECOME NUMBER ONE IN BRITAIN 
MY BOY LOLLIPOP 
BY THE MID SIXTIES BLACK MUSIC WAS ON THE MAP IN THE MAINSTREAM 
AND NOT JUST ON NATIONAL RADIO 
LIKE A SNOWBALL ROLLING DOWN THE SIDE OF A SNOW COVERED HILL 
IT'S GROWING 
LIKE THE SIZE OF A FISH THAT THE MAN CLAIMS BROKE HIS REEL 
IT'S GROWING 
AMERICAN VOCAL GROUPS WITH THEIR FLAMBOYANT CLOTHES AND COOLLY CHOREOGRAPHED ROUTINES 
EXPLODED ONTO BRITISH TELEVISION 
READY STEADY GO BROKE THE MOULD THRILLING TEENAGERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
AND MAKING THEM PART OF THE SHOW 
WHAT MADE READY STEADY GO STAND OUT 
FROM THE OTHER SHOWS 
WAS THAT WE REALLY WERE A REFLECTION 
OF LIFE IN THE EARLY SIXTIES 
NOT JUST FROM THE MUSIC BUT FROM FASHION 
FROM STYLE FROM ART 
I MEAN WE REALLY REFLECTED WHAT WAS GOING ON IN TEENAGERS' LIVES IN THE SIXTIES 
IN ENGLAND 
AND IT WAS IN ENGLAND IT WASN'T JUST LONDON 
IT WAS RIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
NO MORE 
DUSTY SPRINGFIELD HOSTED THE PROGRAMME 
THAT INTRODUCED MOTOWN TO BRITAIN 
DUSTY'S PASSION FOR SOUL RECORDS PERSUADED THE SHOW'S PRODUCERS 
TO RISK STAGING THE SHOW THAT CHANGED BRITISH MUSICAL TASTE 
FOR ALL TIME 
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR DUSTY I WOULD NOT HAVE HEARD 
OF THE MOTOWNS THE STAXES THE ATLANTICS 
THE RECORDS SHE WAS BRINGING BACK PLAYING TO ME 
AND I IN TURN WOULD NOT HAVE BOOKED THESE ACTS ON READY STEADY GO UNLESS I'D FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THEM TOO 
IT WAS TOTALLY UP TO DUSTY AND WHEN WE DID THE SOUND OF MOTOWN THE SPECIAL 
THAT WAS INSTIGATED BY DUSTY SAYING I'LL HOST IT YOU GO TALK TO YOUR PEOPLE 
GET IT ON AND I'LL DO IT 
GONNA BUILD A MOUNTAIN 
FROM A LITTLE HILL 
GONNA BUILD A MOUNTAIN 
I KNOW I WILL 
SHE HAD SOUL WHICH IS A STRANGE OLD FASHIONED THING TO SAY 
BUT SHE REALLY DID SHE HAD A BLACK VOICE 
IN A WHITE BODY 
AND WHEN YOU HAVE A SOULFUL VOICE 
IT MEANS WHEN YOU SING LYRICS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE IT TEARS YOUR HEART OUT 
GONNA BUILD IT OH SO HIGH 
DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA BUILD IT ONLY KNOW I'M GONNA TRY 
GONNA BUILD A MOUNTAIN GONNA BUILD A HEAVEN 
FROM A LITTLE HILL FROM A LITTLE HILL 
TO THE HEAVENS GONNA BUILD A HEAVEN 
OH I KNOW I WILL 
THERE WERE A LOT OF US GIRLS AROUND A LOT OF US WHITE GIRLS AROUND TRYING TO SOUND BLACK 
LOADS OF US WANTED TO SOUND BLACK 
BECAUSE THERE WAS NOBODY INSPIRING WHO WAS WHITE 
SIMPLE AS THAT 
REALLY THAT WAS THE MUSIC 
AND IT WASN'T OH IT WASN'T A CONSCIOUS I WANT TO SOUND BLACK 
BUT YOU WOULD HEAR 
YOU WOULD HEAR THE MIRACLES YOU WOULD HEAR THE TEMPTATIONS YOU WOULD HEAR THE IMPRESSIONS 
YOU WOULD HEAR ARETHA FRANKLIN 
PROMISED MYSELF AFTER THE FIRST ROMANCE 
I WOULDN'T GIVE YA A SECOND CHANCE 
JULIE DRISCOLL SOLD MORE RECORDS THAN ARETHA HERSELF IN THE MID SIXTIES 
AND BECAME THE FACE OF BRITISH SOUL ACROSS EUROPE 
SAVE ME 
OH YEAH YEAH 
SAVE ME 
OH YEAH 
THOSE WHO LOVE ALWAYS GIVE THE MOST 
WE'RE CRYING TOGETHER 
FROM COAST TO COAST 
LOVE LEAVES US COLD AND HURT INSIDE 
THESE TEARS OF OURS UNJUSTIFIED BABY 
SAVE ME 
YEAH 
WE WERE DOING COVER THINGS AND DOING THEM VERY MUCH IN A SIMILAR WAY 
TO THE ORIGINALS 
AND SO THEY WERE INFERIOR REALLY 
THE ENGLISH STUFF WAS DEFINITELY SECOND BEST AT THAT POINT 
THE STONES YOU KNOW WHEN THEIR FIRST L. P. CAME OUT 
I THOUGHT WELL THEY'VE JUST COPIED A LOAD OF MOTOWN STUFF 
I LOOKED ON THEIR EFFORTS TO DO SOUL MUSIC 
WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DISDAIN 
THE SCORN THE MODS FELT FOR BRITISH SOUL WAS NOT TYPICAL 
MOST TEENAGE FANS KNEW LITTLE ABOUT THE ROOTS OF THE MUSIC THEIR NEW HEROES PERFORMED 
NOR DID THEY CARE 
THEY HAD NO IDEA MICK JAGGER HAD BORROWED HIS BEST MOVES 
FROM SOUL LEGEND JAMES BROWN 
YOU MUST BE INFLUENCED BY THINGS WITHOUT COPYING THEM 
AND IT'S THE REAL CHALLENGE TO GET THAT BALANCE RIGHT 
SO YOU'RE NOT TOO DERIVATIVE 
AND YOU HAVE YOUR OWN IDENTITY ON IT 
TO COPY IT TOO LITERALLY 
I THINK IS AN ERROR BUT TO BE INFLUENCED BY SOMETHING 
IT'S JUST ABOUT GETTING THAT BALANCE RIGHT 
AND THAT TO ME IS THE BIG MESSAGE OF THE WHOLE OF THE SIXTIES IN ACTUAL FACT 
ABOUT MICK JAGGER EVEN ABOUT JOHN LENNON 
THAT MICK JAGGER WILL NEVER PLAY THE BLUES LIKE A GUY FROM MISSISSIPPI 
THAT ENTIRELY MISSES THE POINT AND IS IN FACT INADVERTENTLY RACIST 
BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE ALL HAVE TO REMAIN COMPARTMENTALISED 
IN OUR BOXES DOES THAT MEAN THAT MICK JAGGER AND THE BOYS SHOULD BE DOING FOLK MUSIC 
I ROSE OUT OF MY SEAT 
I JUST HAD TO DANCE 
NOTHING'S ORIGINAL 
NO MATTER HOW GREAT IT IS 
IT'S NOT ORIGINAL YOU KNOW 
IT ALWAYS CAME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE 
IT'S ALWAYS HANDED DOWN 
FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT 
I WANTED TO SING LIKE RAY AND I DID FOR A WHILE 
I USED TO JUST APE RAY CHARLES ON STAGE 
A LOT OF US DID 
WANTED MY OWN IDENTITY 
I WOULD HAVE TO DO SOME 
SO I TOOK RAY CHARLES'S FEELING AND SOUL THE CHURCH END OF IT 
AND MIXED IT WITH JOE TURNER 
CONSCIOUSLY 
AND OUT OF THAT MIX SOMEHOW CAME ME 
CAME MY VOICE 
OH MOTHER 
TELL YOUR CHILDREN 
NOT TO DO WHAT I HAVE DONE 
TO SPEND YOUR LIVES IN SIN AND MISERY 
IN THE HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN 
I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT THE BRITISH INDIGENOUS MUSIC SCENE EMERGED 
FROM ALL OF THESE BANDS WHO WANTED TO SOUND LIKE BLACK AMERICANS 
BUT COULDN'T 
THE WHO OR THE SMALL FACES 
TRYING DESPERATELY TO SOUND LIKE THE AMERICAN MUSICIANS THAT THEY LOVED 
BUT THEY WEREN'T VERY GOOD AT IT 
SO THEY MADE SOMETHING ELSE 
YOU GOT THIS ODD KIND OF BASTARD HYBRID 
THEY CALL THE RISING SUN 
AS THEY BECAME TOP OF THE POPS 
EVEN THE B. B. C. NOW FEATURED BRITISH R. AND AMP B. BANDS 
BUT SOME DEDICATED FOLLOWERS OF FASHION STILL HUNGERED 
AFTER THE AUTHENTICITY OF ALL THINGS AMERICAN 
IN A SENSE WE MADE AN EVALUATION 
THAT THE U. K. WAS THIS PLACE THAT WAS 
FATED TO NOW COPY 
WHAT WAS COMING FROM THE MAIN PLACE WHICH WAS OBVIOUSLY AMERICA 
YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU KNOW 
THE SHIFTS IN POWER POST WAR 
WHAT WE KNEW WAS THAT AMERICA HAD THE COMICS THEY HAD BUBBLE GUM 
THEY HAD THE STUFF 
SO THE CULTURAL IMPACT FOR ME 
WAS MADE BY AMERICAN MUSIC 
R. AND AMP B. SOUL JAZZ 
ALL OF IT 
WHEN THE DAY COMES AND YOU'RE IN DOUBT 
IN A RIVER OF TROUBLE 
AND ABOUT TO DROWN EVERYBODY 
HOLD ON 
I'M COMING 
THE HIGH WATER MARK OF SOUL WAS REACHED 
WHEN THE FIRST STAX TOUR HIT THE U. K. 
I'M ON MY WAY 
YOUR LOVER 
THE RAW SOUL OF SINGERS LIKE SAM AND AMP DAVE 
AROUSED AN ARMY OF GYRATING MODS 
NOW JOINED BY MIDDLE CLASS HIPSTERS 
CURIOUS POP FANS 
AND ASPIRING MUSICIANS 
HOLD ON 
OF ALL THE SHOWS I'VE EVER SEEN 
IN FORTY YEARS 
OF GOING TO SHOWS AND SEEING A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE 
THAT TOTALLY BLEW ME AWAY 
THE PASSION AND THE SHOWMANSHIP 
IT WAS AMAZING 
SAM AND AMP DAVE WERE VERY DRAMATIC PERFORMERS 
THE DRAMA THAT THEY USED 
YOU KNOW THERE WAS LOTS OF 
TURNING AND POSING AND ALL THE REST OF IT 
DON'T YOU EVER 
BE SAD 
LEAN ON ME 
WHEN TIMES ARE BAD 
WHEN THE DAY IS COMING AND YOU'RE ARE DOUBTING 
IN A RIVER OF TROUBLE 
AND ABOUT TO DROWN HOLD ON 
YOU'VE GOT TO GET UGLY IN THE FACE 
YOU GOT TO TEAR YOUR FACE UP 
YOUR FACE'S GOT TO HAVE THAT DISTORTION YOU GOT TO FEEL IT 
YOU GOT TO BE LIKE DOUBLE B. 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE LIKE RAY 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE LIKE BILLY YOU KNOW 
YOU GOT TO DO ALL THIS STUFF 
YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO BE LIKE SAM AND AMP DAVE SWEATING AND 
AND NOT WORRIED ABOUT 
GETTING A. 
A SWEAT SPOT ON YOUR COAT 
THE STRANGE SYMBIOSIS BETWEEN THE IMMACULATELY FASHION CONSCIOUS MODS 
AND THE DOWN AND DIRTY BLACK AMERICAN PERFORMERS THEY WORSHIPPED 
WAS THE NORTHERN CLUB SCENE 
ALREADY DEDICATED TO THE SEARCH FOR THE ONE TRUE SOUL 
THOUGH SOUL WAS IN THE CHARTS 
RECORD COLLECTING HAD BECOME AN OBSESSION BY THE LATE SIXTIES 
CURATING BLACK AMERICAN VINYL 
WAS A LIFESTYLE FOR A SUBCULTURE OF BRITISH SOUL WORSHIPPERS 
THEY WERE SO HIP THE KIDS IN ENGLAND 
THE TWISTED WHEEL IN MANCHESTER THE MOJO CLUB SHEFFIELD THEY WERE THE OASISES OF SOUL MUSIC 
ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH 
IT WAS THE MUSIC I LOVED AND THE BEATLES LOVED 
THEIR FIRST ALBUM HAD COVER VERSIONS OF SOME OF THE STUFF ON IT 
THE STONES I MEAN 
I KNEW EVERY B. SIDE KNEW EVERY A SIDE 
IT WAS THE GREATEST MUSIC TO LISTEN TO WE PLAYED 
WILSON PICKETT I BACKED PATTI LABELLE TWICE 
I BACKED BILLY STEWART I BACKED MAJOR LANCE 
IT WAS THE MOST EXCITING ERA 
OF MUSIC IN GENERAL ANYWAY 
THE SOUL MUSIC COMING OUT IN THAT TIME WAS PRICELESS 
IT WAS JUST PEERLESS NEVER BEEN BETTERED 
DANCE WHAT YOU WANNA 
DANCE ANY WAY YOU CAN 
YEAH 
NOW DANCE WHAT YOU WANNA 
DANCE ANY WAY YOU CAN 
THE MODS LIVED FOR SATURDAY NIGHT GOING OUT 
ON THEIR SCOOTERS GOING DOWN TO SOMEWHERE LIKE THE TWISTED WHEEL 
THEY WOULD TAKE THEIR PEP PILLS THEY WOULD DANCE ALL NIGHT 
THEY LIVED FOR THE MUSIC THEY LIVED FOR THE FASHIONS AND THE CAMARADERIE IT BECAME A FANTASY 
IT WAS LIKE DOROTHY IN THE WIZARD OF OZ SUDDENLY WE'RE NOT IN KANSAS ANY MORE 
IT WAS A PSYCHOLOGICAL RELEASE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAD NOTHING ELSE TO LIVE FOR IT WAS THEIR RAISON D'ETRE 
I THINK BRITONS WERE ANORAKS WHEN IT CAME TO SOUL MUSIC A LOT OF SOUL MUSICIANS AND ARTISTS 
WERE MORE POPULAR OVER HERE THAN THEY WERE IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY HAD A BIGGER FOLLOWING 
BEFORE I WENT TO LONDON ENGLAND MY BIGGEST WORRY WAS WOULD THEY KNOW MY SONGS 
WOULD THEY KNOW WHAT I'M SINGING 
OR WOULD I JUST BE INTRODUCING 
THE MATERIAL 
AND I LEARNED TO MY SURPRISE 
THAT THEY KNEW THE SONGS BETTER THAN ME 
THEY KNOW ALL OF THOSE SONGS 
A SIDES B. SIDES 
GENERATION OF REVELATIONS 
AND THAT WAS THE WONDER 
OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AT THAT TIME 
THE GENERATION OF REVELATIONS 
THE WORLD MADE IN A DAY 
EVERYBODY GET TOGETHER WE'RE GONNA WALK HAND IN HAND 
WE'RE GONNA KEEP OURSELVES UP 
IN THIS TROUBLED LAND 
WHEN YOU SPEAK OF SOUL SINGERS A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT IT HAS TO BE A CERTAIN RACE OR 
AGE OR STYLE 
BUT WHEN YOU'RE A SOUL SINGER THAT MEANS YOU'RE RELEASING THE FEELING 
FROM WITHIN AND THAT WHATEVER THAT YOU'RE SINGING 
IT MAY BE COUNTRY ROCK POP OR RAP 
BLUES OR JAZZ OR GOSPEL 
IT'S COMING FROM THE SOUL 
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU A SOUL SINGER 
PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HIP RIGHT 
GIRL AND LET YOUR BACKBONE SLIP 
IF YOU DO IT DO IT RIGHT YEAH 
HOPING ON A SHAKE TONIGHT YEAH 
MAKE YOUR BODY LOOP DE LOOP JUST SHAKE 
READY STEADY GO REACHED ITS ZENITH 
WHEN THE LEGENDARY OTIS REDDING WAS PAIRED WITH LONDONER CHRIS FARLOWE 
AND GEORDIE ERIC BURDON 
BRITISH AND AMERICAN SOUL POWER 
HAD FORGED A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP ALL OF ITS OWN 
ROCK 'N ROLL 
SHAKE AND SHAKE WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT 
IF YOU DO IT DO IT RIGHT 
WITH THE EXPLOSION 
OF YOUTH CULTURE IN THE LATE SIXTIES 
THE WAY WAS OPEN FOR NEW PARTNERSHIPS 
NEW DIRECTIONS 
NEW IDENTITIES 
IN THE DECADES TO FOLLOW THE POWER OF SOUL WOULD TRANSFORM OUR MUSIC 
OUR CULTURE AND GRADUALLY OUR SOCIETY TOO 
DO YOU REMEMBER THE GOOD OLD DAYS BEFORE THE GHOST TOWN 
WE DANCED AND SANG AND THE MUSIC PLAYED INNA DE BOOMTOWN
