THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS SOME STRONG LANGUAGE 
WITH A COMEDY ABOUT REDUNDANCY ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE 
DAVID RENWICK MADE HIMSELF ONE OF THE MOST EMPLOYABLE WRITERS IN BRITISH T. V. 
EVEN BEFORE THAT HE HAD RARELY BEEN SHORT OF WORK CREATING 
WITH ANDREW MARSHALL RADIO HIT THE BURKISS WAY 
AND THE T. V. POLITICAL SATIRES WHOOPS APOCALYPSE AND HOT METAL 
BUT THE TRAGI COMEDY OF VICTOR MELDREW LAUNCHED RENWICK AS A SOLO WRITER 
AND GAVE HIM ONE FOOT ON THE STAGE AT COMEDY AWARD CEREMONIES 
SUBSEQUENTLY WITH THE PRODUCER VERITY LAMBERT WHO DIED RECENTLY 
HE BROUGHT ORIGINAL TWISTS TO THE DETECTIVE DRAMA IN JONATHAN CREEK 
AND THE ROMANTIC COMEDY IN LOVE SOUP 
YOU'VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS AS A COMEDY WRITER 
WHICH INVITES THE OBVIOUS BUT SOMETIMES DIFFICULT QUESTION 
ARE THERE ANY RULES FOR WRITING COMEDY 
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU'RE TOLD TO GIVE ADVICE 
TO YOUNG UP AND COMING WRITERS IN HOW TO WRITE COMEDY 
I JUST THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S EITHER IN YOU 
IT'S INSIDE YOU SOMEWHERE OR IT'S NOT 
AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF TECHNIQUE YOU CAN IMPART TO PEOPLE 
IF I KNEW THE ANSWER TO THAT 
A RULE THAT WOULD INSTRUCT ME IN HOW TO ACHIEVE THAT 
EACH WAKING MORNING MY JOB WOULD BE A LOT EASIER 
BUT THE DIFFICULTY FOR SCREEN WRITERS WHICH NOVELISTS DON'T HAVE 
IS THERE ARE SO MANY EXTERNAL FACTORS 
RICHARD WILSON WASN'T GOING TO DO ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE 
WHICH WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT LATER 
CAROLINE QUENTIN DROPPED OUT OF JONATHAN CREEK CORRECT 
THE MALE LEAD LEFT LOVE SOUP 
SO THE SECOND SERIES OF LOVE SOUP IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT 
YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER ANY OF THAT NO ABSOLUTELY 
AND UM I MEAN IF THERE WERE ONE PIECE OF GUIDANCE THAT YOU KNOW 
I COULD GIVE TO ANY ASPIRANT WRITERS IT WOULD BE 
DON'T FOR A MOMENT THINK YOUR PROBLEMS END WITH GETTING THE SCRIPT RIGHT 
BECAUSE ONCE YOU GET IT INTO PRODUCTION 
THEN YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE SLEW OF FURTHER DISASTERS WAITING TO OCCUR 
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW CONCEIVABLE TO SCREW UP YOUR WORK 
UM I HEARD WOODY ALLEN GIVING AN INTERVIEW 
WHERE HE REFERRED TO A LINE OF MARSHALL BRICKMAN'S 
WHO COLLABORATED WITH HIM ON SOME OF HIS FILMS 
SAYING THAT ON A FILM SET 
EVERY DAY A TRUCK WOULD ROLL UP FULL OF FRESH COMPROMISES 
AND YOU CAN SO RELATE TO THAT BECAUSE SO MUCH OF WHAT YOU DO 
ENDS UP AS AN APPROXIMATION OF YOUR ORIGINAL INTENT 
A MORAL THAT HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED BY OTHERS TO YOU IN LIFE AND WRITING 
IS PREPARE FOR THE WORST BECAUSE THE WORST WILL HAPPEN 
YES YOU DO LIVE BY THAT PRINCIPLE YES 
JUST WHEN YOU THINK THINGS ARE NEVER EVER GOING TO GET BETTER THEY SUDDENLY GET WORSE 
THAT'S VICTOR'S SORT OF DICTUM AND MINE ALSO 
BY THAT RULE COS I MEAN THEN IF THINGS DON'T YOU'RE VERY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED 
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT 
THE CRUSHING BLOW OF THINGS TAKING A REAL UNEXPECTED NOSEDIVE 
IS HARDER FOR ME TO TAKE 
I AM UNFORTUNATELY WORKING IN A BUSINESS FOR WHICH I AM TEMPERAMENTALLY UNSUITED 
I'M JUST COMPLETELY I HAVE A VERY VERY LOW RESILIENCE AND THIN SKIN 
ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT I DO 
BUT YOU'VE SAID I HAVE VERY LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN ANYTHING IS THAT TRUE 
YES THAT WAS A PRETTY OVERARCHING STATEMENT 
OF MY GENERAL PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE REALLY 
UM IT'S 
IT'S VERY I MEAN YES OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO SQUARE THAT WITH 
UM I SUPPOSE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE THAT THINGS 
THAT YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK 
THAT SOMETHING ISN'T GOING TO GO WRONG HALFWAY THROUGH THE PROCESS 
AND THAT EVERYONE'S GOING TO ADORE 
WHAT YOU'VE WRITTEN AND PRODUCED AT THE END OF THE DAY 
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THAT'S JUST A COMPLETELY SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT WHICH I AM NO PART OF 
THERE IS A SORT OF AN INNATE PESSIMISM THAT I DO BRING TO TO LIFE AND TO MY WORK 
THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT THE GLASS HALF FULL 
I DON'T HAVE A GLASS THERE IS NO GLASS FOR ME 
AND YOU ARE UM 
IN VARIOUS BOOKS ABOUT ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE THERE ARE EXTRACTS FROM YOUR JOURNAL 
AND YOU'RE CLEARLY A BIT OF A WORRIER THE SCRIPTS COME VERY SLOWLY AND AGONISINGLY 
IT'S THURSDAY MORNING A COUPLE OF GOOD LINES THURSDAY AFTERNOON TAKE THEM OUT MM 
FRIDAY MORNING YES 
ABANDON WHOLE SCRIPT YES 
IT'S PATHETIC THAT I ALSO SPEND MY TIME SITTING WRITING ABOUT THAT AND CATALOGUING IT 
I SUPPOSE IN A WAY THAT KIND OF GETS IT OUT OF MY SYSTEM 
AND THE FACT THAT I THEN HAVE THAT RECORDED 
TO GO BACK TO FIVE YEARS AFTER THE EVENT 
I THINK YES IT WAS JUST AS BAD THEN 
MY WIFE SAYS YOU ALWAYS SAY THIS I SAY WELL I CAN'T WRITE 
I CANNOT COME UP WITH A SCRIPT YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT YES 
BUT THIS MAY BE THE TIME THAT ACTUALLY YES BUT YOU SAID THAT LAST TIME AS WELL 
YES YOU'RE RIGHT I DID SAY THAT AND I MANAGED TO COME UP WITH IT 
BUT IT STILL COULD BE THE TIME THAT YOU COME UP WITH NOTHING 
AND IT IS THIS CONSTANT PROCESS OF REASSESSMENT AND UM 
FAMOUSLY THE MASTERMIND SKETCH I WROTE FOR THE TWO RONNIES WHICH HAS BEEN REPEATED AD INFINITUM 
ANSWERING THE QUESTION BEFORE THE LAST ONE 
I HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED FOR SO MANY SKETCHES FOR THAT SERIES 
AND I WAS AT THE POINT OF DESPERATION AND IT WAS ACTUALLY A SKETCH 
I HAD WRITTEN THAT PREMISE IN A SKETCH FOR THE RADIO SERIES CALLED THE BURKISS WAY 
AND THEN I THOUGHT THAT WASN'T A BAD IDEA I'LL REWRITE IT FOR THE TWO RONNIES 
AND I DID A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT VERSION OF IT A BETTER VERSION 
BUT THE NEXT DAY I THOUGHT 
THIS IS SO CONTRIVED AND IT'S SO OFF THE WALL IT WORKED ON BURKISS 
BUT THE TWO RONNIES IS A MAINSTREAM ACT THEY WON'T GO FOR IT 
AND I LITERALLY JUST TORE IT UP IN FRUSTRATION AND DISAPPOINTMENT 
I THOUGHT I'D GOT A SKETCH OUT OF THE WAY AND THEN TIME WENT ON 
AND I COULDN'T COME UP WITH ANYTHING BETTER 
AND I LITERALLY FISHED THEM OUT AND I SELLOTAPED THE PIECES OF PAPER BACK TOGETHER RETYPED IT SENT IT IN 
AND THEY WERE ENTHUSED OVER IT 
AND SO TO OUR FIRST CONTENDER GOOD EVENING YOUR NAME PLEASE 
GOOD EVENING IN THE FIRST HEAT YOUR SUBJECT WAS ANSWERING QUESTIONS BEFORE THEY WERE ASKED 
THIS TIME YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO ANSWER THE QUESTION BEFORE LAST CORRECT 
CHARLIE SMITHERS 
YOUR TIME STARTS NOW WHAT IS PALAEONTOLOGY 
YES ABSOLUTELY CORRECT 
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE DIRECTORY THAT LISTS PEERS 
A STUDY OF OLD FOSSILS 
WHO ARE LEN MURRAY AND SIR GEOFFREY HOWE 
BURKE'S 
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DONKEY AND AN ASS 
ONE'S A TRADE UNION LEADER THE OTHER IS A MEMBER OF THE CABINET 
COMPLETE THE QUOTATION TO BE OR NOT TO BE 
THEY'RE BOTH THE SAME 
WHAT IS BERNARD MANNING FAMOUS FOR 
THAT IS THE QUESTION CORRECT 
WHO IS THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY 
HE IS A FAT MAN WHO TELLS BLUE JOKES 
THERE'S THIS STAGE OF LOOKING BACK OVER SOMETHING 
AND IT'S LIKE STARING AT A WORD FOR EVER AND EVER 
AND THE WORD CEASES TO HAVE ANY MEANING AND THAT'S HOW IT IS 
PARTICULARLY WITH COMEDY AND WITH IDEAS 
EVALUATING THEM IS THE HARDEST PART IF YOU COULD JUST PLUG IT IN 
INTO A JOKE METER A FUNNY O. METER 
AND SEE WHAT THE READING IS ON THE SCALE LIFE WOULD BE MUCH SIMPLER 
BUT AFTER THIRTY FIVE YEARS YOU MUST HAVE SOME KIND OF INSTINCT 
BECAUSE ONE OF THE WORST THINGS WRITERS HAVE TO GO THROUGH IS THE READ THROUGH 
WHERE EVERYONE SITS DOWN AND READS THE SCRIPT 
ARE YOU SURPRISED EITHER WAY STILL 
THAT A FUNNY LINE WILL NOT GET A LAUGH AND SOMETHING ELSE WILL 
WELL I'M ALWAYS DISMAYED AT A READ THROUGH IF SOMETHING GETS A LAUGH 
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IT WOULD NEVER GET THAT LAUGH EVER AGAIN 
OF COURSE THE OPPOSITE WAS TRUE IN THE EARLY DAYS 
YOU'D SIT THERE AT A READ THROUGH AND IF THINGS DIDN'T TAKE OFF 
THEN YOU'D GO AWAY AND SLASH YOUR WRISTS 
BUT OF COURSE AS TIME GOES ON 
YOU REALISE THAT COMEDY IS SUCH AN AMAZINGLY FRAGILE COMMODITY 
UM THAT 
YOU GET TO UNDERSTAND 
THAT SOMETHING THAT PLAYS PERFECTLY AT A READ THROUGH 
HOW ARE YOU EVER GOING TO ACHIEVE THAT AGAIN YOU'RE NOT 
BUT ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE 
I MEAN BY THE TIME WE WERE INTO THE THIRD FOURTH FIFTH SIXTH SERIES 
YOU DIDN'T REALLY EXPECT ANYTHING TO GET A LAUGH AT THE READ 
I MEAN RICHARD HAS NEVER GOT ANYWHERE NEAR PEAKING AT THE READ THROUGH 
I THINK HE'LL BE THE FIRST TO CONFESS 
AND YOU WOULDN'T WANT HIM TO 
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT IT TO BE THAT GOOD UNTIL THE AUDIENCE ARE IN 
AND THE CAMERAS ARE ROLLING THAT'S WHEN IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IT'S RIGHT 
GOING BACK TO YOUR CHILDHOOD BORN IN LUTON IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE 
INTERESTING PLACE FOR A COMIC WRITER TO COME FROM BECAUSE 
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT IT'S ONE OF THOSE TOWNS 
THIS ISN'T MY OPINION BUT IT'S ONE YOU HEAR FROM OTHER PEOPLE 
IT'S A BIT OF A JOKE TOWN TO SOME PEOPLE AND 
IT'S A JOKE TOWN TO ME THERE WAS THE TIME WHEN I WAS WRITING WITH ANDREW MARSHALL WHO LIVED IN CATFORD 
WE FELT THAT BETWEEN THE TWO OF US LUTON AND CATFORD 
WE'D GOT IT COVERED BETWEEN THE TWO SORT OF ARSEHOLES OF THE UNIVERSE 
SOME OF THE INSECURITY THAT YOU HAVE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT 
WAS BECAUSE YOUR FATHER HAD A LIFE THAT WAS EVEN MORE INSECURE THAN THE FREELANCE WRITER 
HE HAD SEVERAL JOBS IN EFFECT DIDN'T HE WELL MY DAD WAS YEAH 
JUST VERY HUMBLE STOCK AND HE WAS A MILKMAN MOST OF HIS LIFE 
THAT WAS THE JOB THAT HE DID 
BUT HE TRIED VARIOUS OTHER UM JOBS 
TO EKE A LIVING HE SOLD NEWSPAPERS 
WELL I MEAN HE SOLD NEWSPAPERS WHILE HE WAS DELIVERING MILK 
THAT WAS HIS AFTERNOON JOB TO SUPPLEMENT THE MEAGRE PAY OF THE MILK ROUNDS MAN 
AND HE RAN A TRANSPORT CAFE FOR A WHILE THAT WAS THE SORT OF 
WE NEVER I MEAN WE WEREN'T ROLLING IN MONEY 
I WAS AN ONLY CHILD SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE A SORT OF HUGE OUTLAY 
BUT YES THERE WAS AN INSECURITY 
I'VE NEVER REALLY TRIED THAT KIND OF ANALYTICAL UM 
APPROACH TO MY CHILDHOOD IT WAS NEVER FELT 
THAT WE WERE SO ON THE BREADLINE THAT WE WERE IN DANGER OF GOING UNDER 
BUT I SUPPOSE IT'S DIFFERENT FROM LIVING IN AN INCREDIBLY WELL HEELED COMFORTABLE KIND OF ENVIRONMENT 
MAYBE I MEAN MAYBE THERE WAS A BIT OF ADVERSITY THERE 
THAT COLOURED MY LATER APPROACH TO LIFE I DON'T KNOW 
ALSO CLASS IS FAMOUSLY IMPORTANT IN ENGLISH COMEDY 
WERE YOU AWARE OF BEING WORKING CLASS WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP 
UM WELL 
I CERTAINLY WASN'T AWARE OF BEING ANYTHING ELSE 
AND I CAN REMEMBER A MOMENT IN GRAMMAR SCHOOL 
WHERE ONE OF THE TEACHERS ASKED 
IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN THIS CLASS WHO FEELS THEY ARE WORKING CLASS 
THAT ACTUALLY WAS THE QUESTION 
AND ONE PERSON BRAVELY PUT THEIR HAND UP YEAH I NEVER FELT I WAS ANYTHING LESS THAN WORKING CLASS 
AND I DIDN'T DARE PUT MY HAND UP I WAS JUST TOO INHIBITED 
TO VOLUNTEER ALTHOUGH I WAS QUITE AWARE I WAS 
YOU'D BEEN GIVEN A CRUCIAL PRESENT LOOKING BACK WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG 
WHEN YOU WERE NINE YOU WERE GIVEN A TYPEWRITER 
I HAD MY FIRST TYPEWRITER AT THE AGE OF NINE YES 
IT WAS A REMINGTON HOME PORTABLE WHICH HAD YOU ASKED FOR IT 
I PROBABLY HAD I CAN'T REMEMBER 
I THINK I MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT I WAS INTERESTED IN WRITING 
AND IT WOULD BE THE MOST WONDERFUL GIFT WHICH IT WAS 
AND I USED TO WRITE 
I MEAN THIS IS PART OF THE KIND OF BIZARRE BACKGROUND I HAD 
IN TERMS OF LITERATURE 
THAT I LOVED ALL THESE PUBLIC SCHOOL STORIES I USED TO READ JENNINGS AND BILLY BUNTER STORIES 
I'D DEVOUR AVIDLY EVERY BOOK FROM THE LIBRARY 
AND CONSIDERING THE SORT OF ATTITUDE I LATER DEVELOPED TO PUBLIC SCHOOL 
AND MY AVERSION TO ALL THAT 
OF COURSE I WAS VERY MUCH A STATE SCHOOL PRODUCT 
BUT I LOVED THAT WORLD JUST THE ESCAPISM OF IT 
IT'S NOT THAT SURPRISING BECAUSE PUBLISHERS THOUGHT HARRY POTTER WOULDN'T SELL 
ON THE BASIS THAT WHY WOULD KIDS IN STATE SCHOOLS BUT IN FACT THEY DO WANT THEM 
BECAUSE IT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY HAVE THAT'S RIGHT 
IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESCAPIST 
YOU'RE TRANSPORTED TO ANOTHER WORLD WHICH IS SO FAR REMOVED FROM THE DRUDGERY THAT YOU EXPERIENCE 
TURNING UP AT YOUR LOCAL COMPREHENSIVE EVERY DAY 
AND IT WAS THAT YOU KNOW THE COSY STUDY WITH THE FIRE BURNING 
AND THE BUNS AND THE SCONES 
AND UM 
SO I USED TO WRITE MY OWN PUBLIC SCHOOLBOYS I INVENTED CHARACTERS 
AND I USED TO TYPE THEM ON LITTLE A FOUR PAGES SIDEWAYS 
SO THAT I COULD THEN FOLD THEM UP AND STITCH THEM TOGETHER AND BIND THEM 
THAT IN CONJUNCTION WITH COMIC BOOKS 
SUPERHERO COMIC BOOKS WHICH WAS MY OTHER HUGE INTEREST OF A WASTED CHILDHOOD 
WHAT USED TO ABSOLUTELY FASCINATE ME WAS THE D. C. COMICS 
I WASN'T SO KEEN ON SUPERMAN AND BATMAN 
BUT I USED TO BUY AND READ ALL THE FLASH GREEN LANTERN JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA 
ALL THOSE I ABSOLUTELY LOVED 
I CREATED MY OWN CHARACTERS WHICH WERE OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW ERSATZ FLASH GREEN LANTERN 
VERY THINLY DISGUISED VERSIONS 
AND THE BIG THING THE HUGEST INFLUENCE I'D SAY WAS ON RADIO 
I'M SORRY I'LL READ THAT AGAIN 
WHICH WE WERE ALL ABSOLUTELY DEVOTED TO IN OUR CLASS AT ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OLD AT GRAMMAR SCHOOL 
AND I USED TO WRITE DOWN REFERENCES TO ALL THE JOKES 
AND THEN WE'D GO THROUGH ALL THE JOKES WE'D QUOTE THEM TO EACH OTHER AGAIN THE NEXT DAY 
AND ENJOY THEM ALL OVER AGAIN ALL THESE TERRIBLE PUNS 
INTERESTING TO WRITE THEM DOWN NOT JUST REMEMBER I WAS FRIGHTENED I'D FORGET THEM 
YOU WERE WRITING THIRTY MINUTE SITCOMS WHEN YOU WERE QUITE YOUNG 
YEAH WERE YOU JUST KNOCKING THEM OUT ON THAT TYPEWRITER 
THAT WAS A WASTE OF TIME I MEAN 
WHY WOULD YOU BUT THEN IT'S THE SORT OF THING YOU DO I SUPPOSE 
AS A FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEAR OLD I THINK I'LL WRITE A SITCOM 
YOU KNOW AND IT WAS RUBBISH COMPLETE RUBBISH 
WHAT KIND OF THINGS WERE YOU WRITING 
WELL MOST OF THEM WERE BY 
I SUPPOSE BY THE STANDARDS OF WHAT I DO TODAY WERE VERY CONVENTIONAL 
UM AND IN THE VEIN OF I THINK IN THE VEIN OF 
WHAT I LIKE TO THINK WAS IN THE VEIN OF 
OBVIOUSLY A VERY POOR SHADOW OF GALTON AND SIMPSON 
BUT WHAT WAS AMAZING 
I SENT A WHOLE CLUTCH OF THESE TO WELL I SENT THEM EVERYWHERE 
I GOT THEM ALL BACK BY RETURN OF POST ALL THE TIME 
AND QUITE DESERVEDLY SO BUT I SENT THEM EVENTUALLY 
TO A PRODUCER CALLED EDWARD TAYLOR 
WHO AT THAT TIME WAS HEAD OF LIGHT ENTERTAINMENT OF B. B. C. RADIO 
AND ONE OF THEM WHICH WAS THE MOST ABSURD OF THE LOT AGAIN ACTUALLY 
WAS THE MERGING TOGETHER OF THESE TWO GENRES 
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL AND COMEDY 
THIS WAS FREDERICK DUNNE'S SCHOOLDAYS 
YES AND WHAT WAS PARTICULARLY INSANE ABOUT THAT 
WAS THAT IT CONTAINED ALL THESE IN JOKES 
WHICH WOULD ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD BY PEOPLE IN MY CLASS AT SCHOOL 
BECAUSE IT WAS POPULATED BY CHARACTERS FROM MY SCHOOL 
AND TEACHERS FROM SIXTH FORM COLLEGE 
SO WHY ON EARTH I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT ANYONE OUTSIDE OUR LITTLE 
KIND OF YOU KNOW CLIQUE WOULD EVER GET ANYTHING OUT OF IT 
AND HE WROTE BACK TO ME AND SAID WE CAN'T USE ANY OF THIS 
BUT IF YOU'D LIKE TO COME UP TO TOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT PLEASE DO 
WHICH WAS THE MOST INCREDIBLE INVITATION 
THAT SOMEONE WAS ACTUALLY ASKING ME TO GO AND TALK WHICH I DID 
AS A TEENAGER YEAH YEAH 
I WAS ABOUT SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN I THINK 
AND I WENT AND HAD A CHAT WITH HIM AT AEOLIAN HALL IN NEW BOND STREET 
WHICH WAS THE SEAT OF RADIO LIGHT ENTERTAINMENT IN THOSE DAYS 
AND HE SAID PERSONALLY THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO 
COS HE USED TO PRODUCE THINGS LIKE MEN FROM THE MINISTRY 
AND ALL THE CONSERVATIVE OUTPUT FROM THE DEPARTMENT 
SO HE SENT ME TO DAVID HATCH WHO IS YOU KNOW KIND OF HEAD OF WACKY 
YOU KNOW ON B. B. C. RADIO 
AND COS I KNEW EXACTLY WHO DAVID HATCH WAS 
COS I WAS A BIG FAN OF SORRY I'LL READ THAT AGAIN 
WHICH HE WAS IN AND HE PRODUCED 
AS A STAFF MEMBER B. B. C. STAFF SO I SENT SOME SKETCHES IN TO DAVID 
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER I DIDN'T GET THEM BACK IN THE NEXT POST 
AND INSTEAD I GOT A LETTER SAYING 
WE'D LIKE TO HANG ON TO THESE FOR A WHILE AND SEE IF WE CAN USE THEM 
I'VE NO IDEA WHERE OR HOW AT THIS STAGE BUT LEAVE IT WITH ME 
AND THEN A COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER I GOT ANOTHER LETTER SAYING 
THINGS ARE MOVING FASTER THAN I EXPECTED 
WE MAY HAVE FOUND A HOME FOR THEM COME UP AND TALK ABOUT IT 
SO MYSELF DAVID HATCH AND PETER SPENCE 
WHO WAS AN ESTABLISHED WRITER AT THAT STAGE HE WROTE WEEK ENDING 
AND THE THREE OF US SAT THERE READING THESE SKETCHES 
AND DAVID HATCH WAS JUST SORT OF GOING RED IN THE FACE 
AND LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY WHICH WAS WONDERFUL 
BUT I DON'T TAKE ANY CREDIT FOR THIS 
PETE SPENCE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF A COMEDY FACTORY 
WHICH WAS JUST PRODUCING COMEDY AND THAT WAS BASICALLY PETE'S IDEA 
AND HE ASKED ME IF I'D JUST WRITE IT WITH HIM A SERIES 
I THOUGHT THAT'S 
I MEAN I'D JUST SIGNED MY THREE YEARS INDENTURES ON THE LUTON NEWS 
WHERE I'D GOT A JOB AS A NEWSPAPER REPORTER AND I SAID 
I'VE JUST COMMITTED THREE YEARS OF WORK AS A CUB REPORTER 
AND I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN ANY WAY QUALIFIED TO DO SO 
BUT DURING THAT PERIOD 
I THEN CONTINUED TO CONTRIBUTE ODDS AND ENDS TO THAT 
AND VARIOUS RADIO SHOWS 
IT'S AN AMAZINGLY SMOOTH ENTRY TO THE WRITING PROFESSION 
I SUPPOSE IT WAS IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT AT THE TIME 
IT'S FUNNY HOW YOU THINK WELL 
AND I REMEMBER SPECIFICALLY THE WORDS 
PETE SPENCE SAYING HOW OLD ARE YOU NINETEEN 
NINETEEN AND YOU'RE ON THE RADIO YOU KNOW 
AND YOU THINK YEAH BUT YOU KNOW I DESPERATELY WANT TO BE ON THE RADIO 
I WANT TO BE DOING MORE GETTING MORE ON THAN THIS 
YOU KNOW I'VE GOT ONE SKETCH ON 
FOR WHICH I WAS PAID THREE POUNDS A MINUTE WHICH WAS GREAT 
EIGHT MINUTES OF MATERIAL THAT'S TWENTY FOUR QUID 
THAT'S ABOUT TEN POUNDS MORE THAN I WAS EARNING PER WEEK 
ON THIS NEWSPAPER IN NINETEEN SEVENTY 
YEAH IT DOES SOUND GOOD BUT THEN AFTER 
WHAT DID YOUR PARENTS MAKE OF ALL THIS UM 
WELL MY DAD WAS JUST 
HE WOULD ACCOMMODATE ANYTHING THAT I WANTED TO DO 
HE GAVE IT HIS COMPLETE BLESSING AND JUST LOVED THE IDEA 
MUM THOUGHT YOU'VE GOT A PROPER JOB 
WHY ON EARTH ARE YOU WASTING YOUR TIME 
AND DURING THIS WHOLE PERIOD YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN ONLY CHILD 
LIVING AT HOME WITH YOUR PARENTS UNTIL RELATIVELY LATE 
NORMALLY THOSE PEOPLE BECOME SERIAL KILLERS OR WRITERS 
BUT YOU SOUND VERY VERY SOLITARY AND DRIVEN 
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE I WAS VERY SOLITARY UM 
I SUPPOSE I PROBABLY WAS 
YOU DON'T KIND OF ANALYSE YOUR APPROACH AND YOUR ATTITUDES IN THAT WAY DO YOU 
YOU JUST GET ON WITH IT 
BUT I WAS I WAS QUITE WELL INSULATED 
AND JUST DIDN'T GO THE SERIAL KILLER ROUTE IN THE END 
PROBABLY LESS MONEY IN IT ANYWAY 
AS A WRITER FIRST OF ALL YOU WEREN'T SOLITARY COS YOU HAD THE CO WRITER ANDREW MARSHALL 
WELL I FIRST MET ANDREW AT AEOLIAN HALL 
IN THE WRITERS' ROOM AT NEW BOND STREET 
I WOULD GO UP THERE SOMETIMES ON A WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON 
IF I GOT TIME OFF FROM MY JOB 
AND THAT'S WHERE I MET PEOPLE LIKE JOHN LLOYD AND DOUGLAS ADAMS AND ANDREW 
THEY WOULD THEY SPENT SEVERAL DAYS IN THAT ROOM DURING THE WEEK 
ACTUALLY WRITING THE MATERIAL 
WHEREAS I WENT IN AND DELIVERED MY MATERIAL 
I NEVER WROTE WITHIN THAT CONTEXT BUT ANDREW AND I YOU KNOW 
WE USED TO GO OFF FOR A DRINK AND A MEAL AFTERWARDS AND THINGS 
I THINK WE FELT THERE WAS SOME KIND OF COMMON BOND THERE 
AND WE'VE SINCE THEN TRIED TO EXPLAIN THAT 
BUT BASICALLY WE JUST GOT ON 
AND WE SHARED VERY MUCH THE SAME SENSE OF HUMOUR 
BUT WE WERE ALSO UNUSUALLY IN THAT GROUP MORE WORKING CLASS 
I THINK WE WERE THE STATE SCHOOL WORKING CLASS 
BECAUSE BRITISH CULTURE THEN 
AND EVEN NOW WAS PRETTY POSH IN LONDON 
YEAH AND I JUST 
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I'D BEEN AMONG SO MANY PEOPLE 
WHO KIND OF SPOKE SO WELL YOU KNOW 
AND ANDREW I DON'T SUPPOSE HE'LL MIND ME SAYING IT 
COS HE'S ALWAYS SAID IT HIMSELF HE HAS A NASAL WHINY VOICE 
AND I HAVE THE VOICE I HAVE NOW WHICH IS PRETTY WHINY 
AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT YOU KNOW THAT SORT OF NEWSREADER 
OXBRIDGE KIND OF ACCENT THAT EVERYBODY HAD 
WHO WERE ALL SITTING IN THE ROOM AROUND US 
SO IT WAS NATURAL SELECTION 
YEAH I THINK IT WAS A SORT OF DARWINIAN PROCESS THAT WE GOT TOGETHER 
AND WE ENDED UP WRITING A SERIES CALLED THE BURKISS WAY FOR RADIO FOUR 
WHICH INCREDIBLY RAN FOR FORTY SEVEN EPISODES 
SEVENTY SIX TO NINETEEN EIGHTY I THINK IT WAS 
SO THAT WAS THE BREAKTHROUGH 
AND THEN YOUR T. V. BREAKTHROUGH WAS WHOOPS APOCALYPSE ON L. W. T. 
THAT WAS IT WAS NINETEEN EIGHTY YES AND IT WAS 
THE SOVIETS HAD JUST MOVED INTO AFGHANISTAN 
AND I WAS JUST ABSOLUTELY AND COMPLETELY TERRIFIED 
I WAS CONVINCED THAT THIS WAS THE END OF CIVILISATION 
THE END OF THE WORLD I WAS ABSOLUTELY AT MY WITS' END 
THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE ANXIETY FROM WHICH YOU'VE ALWAYS SUFFERED 
ALTHOUGH LOTS OF PEOPLE DID BELIEVE AT THAT TIME 
THAT THE WORLD WAS GOING TO END 
WELL THE MOST FRIGHTENING ASPECT OF THAT ERA WHEN THE SOVIETS WERE IN 
WAS TURNING ON THE NINE O'CLOCK NEWS 
AND SEEING PETER WOODS HALF SITTING ON THE DESK 
WITH ONE BUTTOCK ON THE DESK 
NOT STANDING BEHIND IT 
NOW OF COURSE WE'RE USED TO SEEING NEWSREADERS STANDING 
AND WALKING ABOUT 
BUT AT THAT TIME ALL NEWSREADERS SAT BEHIND THEIR DESKS 
AND PETER WOODS IS STANDING AND HE'S IN FRONT OF IT 
THE CRISIS IN AFGHANISTAN 
AND I THOUGHT THIS IS TERRIBLE 
PETER WOODS IS STANDING IN FRONT OF THE DESK MY GOD THE END IS NIGH 
AND YOU THOUGHT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO AND 
AND IT WAS IT WAS ALL THAT I REMEMBER DEAN RUSS SAYING 
WELL IF THEY MOVE FURTHER FORWARD IF THEY MOVE INTO SAUDI ARABIA 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO IN AND GET THEM OUT 
SO HOW WE SAT DOWN AND WROTE A COMEDY ABOUT IT IS COMPLETELY BEYOND ME NOW BUT 
IT'S QUITE A DARING SERIES WHICH IS PERHAPS WHY THE B. B. C. TURNED IT DOWN 
I VIVIDLY REMEMBER A SEQUENCE IN WHICH A STUDENT IS BEING CRUCIFIED OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE WINDOWS 
AND THE LINE IS 
THE EASTER DECORATIONS ARE A TRIFLE SEVERE THIS YEAR 
IT WAS A DARING PERIOD OF COMEDY THERE BUT THEN HOT METAL 
WHICH WAS THE NEXT ONE AGAIN QUITE EIGHTIES 
BECAUSE IT DREW ON THE RISE OF THE NEWSPAPER BARONS 
ROBERT MAXWELL RUPERT MURDOCH 
WHAT YOU WANTED TO BE THIS SORT OF YOU KNOW 
SWINGEING VITUPERATIVE KIND OF ASSAULT ON TABLOID VALUES 
THAT THE VIEWERS WOULD FIND SO SATISFYING 
IT DIDN'T WORK AT ALL IT'S LIKE SPITTING IMAGE 
PEOPLE LOVING HAVING SEEN THEMSELVES ON SPITTING IMAGE 
NO DON'T ENJOY IT THIS IS MEANT TO MAKE YOU FEEL REALLY BAD 
AND TO WIND YOU AND TO EXPOSE THE CRIMES OF TABLOIDISM 
AND OF COURSE THEY ALL LOVED IT 
YOU WROTE ANOTHER SERIES WITH ANDREW 
WHICH WAS ALEXEI SAYLE'S STUFF 
BUT YOU WERE PRETTY MUCH ON YOUR OWN AFTER THAT 
IT'S THE OBVIOUS QUESTION ABOUT DOUBLE ACT WRITERS 
DID YOU FALL OUT 
WE DIDN'T FALL OUT NO NO NOT AT ALL 
I MEAN IT WAS MORE JUST A QUESTION OF SCHEDULING REALLY WE'D UM 
WE'D HAD OUR INDIVIDUAL CAREERS IN TANDEM WITH OUR PARTNERSHIP 
FOR ALL OF THAT TIME ANYWAY 
I MEAN I'D WRITTEN FOR THE TWO RONNIES 
AND LOTS OF SHOWS WITH VARIOUS COMEDIANS 
AND ANDREW HAD HIS OWN PROJECTS AND HE'D 
I THINK IF I REMEMBER IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE I THINK IT WAS 
HE'D DONE A SERIES CALLED SOB SISTERS FOR CENTRAL WITH GWEN TAYLOR 
AND I THINK THAT HE WAS IN THE PROCESS OF WRITING A SECOND SERIES OF THAT 
AND I WAS JUST KICKING MY HEELS A BIT 
I'D DONE SOME ADAPTATIONS OF SOME POIROTS FOR LONDON WEEKEND 
AND I THINK I HAD DABBLED WITH A MOVIE SCRIPT 
I WAS TRYING TO WRITE A THRILLER 
AND THAT DEFEATED ME AND I THOUGHT 
I'LL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING A BIT EASIER 
AND SEE IF I CAN WRITE A SITCOM ON MY OWN A DOMESTIC SITCOM 
SO I SAT DOWN TO WHAT EVENTUALLY BECAME ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE 
AND THAT WAS PICKED UP 
AT EXACTLY THE POINT THAT WAS PICKED UP 
ANDREW'S SECOND SERIES WAS CANCELLED 
AND THEN HE STARTED YOU KNOW TO EXPLORE OTHER PROJECTS 
AND EVENTUALLY DID TWENTY FOUR CHILDREN AND YOU KNOW 
BUT BY THE TIME BOTH THOSE SERIES WERE UP AND RUNNING 
IT JUST SEEMED A NATURAL THING FOR US TO DIVERGE 
AND JUST STICK WITH OUR OWN PROJECTS 
DEAR MRS. MELDREW HAVE FILLED IN THE HOLE NOW 
HOPE IT IS TO YOUR SATISFACTION 
IT CERTAINLY IS TO MINE 
MARGARET 
VICTOR 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WHAT AM I DOING 
WALLPAPERING THE SPARE BEDROOM 
WHAT THE BLOODY HELL DOES IT LOOK AS IF I'M DOING 
NOT VERY MUCH 
VICTOR MELDREW LOOKING AT HIM NOW 
IT'S QUITE AN UNUSUAL CHARACTER FOR A THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD WRITER TO HAVE COME UP WITH 
BUT WHAT WHERE HAD IT COME FROM 
WELL HE DIDN'T NEED TO BE AS OLD AS HE WAS 
THAT WAS THE IRONY OF IT WAS THAT 
YOU KNOW AS A THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD I WAS WRITING ABOUT YOU KNOW 
SOMEONE WHO'S LATE FIFTIES SIXTIES 
I MEAN NOW I'M APPROACHING THAT AGE I'M WRITING ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLDS 
YOU KNOW IN LOVE SOUP 
SO YOU KNOW I MEAN YES 
THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND ATTITUDE 
AND MINDSET THAT YOU BRING TO IT I GUESS 
BUT IT WAS REALLY JUST ABOUT SOMEONE WITH A LOT OF TIME ON HIS HANDS 
WITH I MEAN 
AND IT WAS THAT TIME IN THE EIGHTIES 
WHEN WE WERE STARTING TO READ ABOUT PEOPLE'S CAREERS ENDING AT FIFTY YEAH 
EARLY RETIREMENT BECAME THE BIG THING DIDN'T IT 
YEAH AND MY DAD HAD BEEN PERSUADED TO TAKE SLIGHTLY EARLY RETIREMENT FROM HIS JOB AND THAT WAS 
IT WAS SUCH A TECHNICALITY TO ME THAT 
THE SHOW WAS ALL ABOUT A CHARACTER WHICH IT HAS TO BE 
I MEAN THAT'S THE START OF ANY HALF DECENT COMEDY SHOW OR DRAMA 
OR ANYTHING IS GETTING A GOOD CHARACTER 
SO HE COULD HAVE BEEN A THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD 
BUT TWO THINGS AFFECTED THAT 
ONE WAS THAT IT GAVE A PEG OF SOME SORT 
SOME SORT OF SELLING POINT TO THE B. B. C. 
TO SAY IT'S ABOUT THIS MAN WHO'S JUST BEEN FORCED INTO EARLY RETIREMENT 
AND THE OTHER THING WAS THAT I REALLY DID WANT TO WRITE IT FOR RICHARD WILSON 
WHO I'D JUST BEEN WORKING WITH ON HOT METAL 
AND SO THE TWO THINGS JUST SEEMED TO MESH TOGETHER 
YOU'D WRITTEN IT FOR RICHARD WILSON 
BUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT AT FIRST 
NO NO THAT WAS YET ANOTHER OF THOSE WONDERFUL MOMENTS IN THE HISTORY OF MY CAREER 
THAT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A COMPLETE SHOO IN YOU KNOW 
RICHARD WHO WAS NOT IN SO MUCH DEMAND 
AND WOULD PROBABLY KILL FOR HIS OWN SITCOM VEHICLE ON TELEVISION 
PHONE CALL CAME 
NO RICHARD'S TURNED US DOWN DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT 
OH GREAT SO BACK TO SQUARE ONE 
I THINK HE HAD SOME ISSUES WITH THE SCRIPT 
WE ONLY SHOWED HIM THE FIRST COUPLE OF SCRIPTS TO BEGIN WITH 
AND I THINK HE JUST SAW IT AS A MAN WHO WAS SHOUTING A LOT 
PLUS THERE WERE VERY PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
HE'D JUST FINISHED DIRECTING A FILM FOR THE B. B. C. 
AND HE'D PROMISED HIMSELF A HOLIDAY 
AND SO WE HAD TO SCRUB AROUND FOR QUITE A WHILE LOOKING 
CONSIDERING OTHER ACTORS 
IT WAS GOING TO BE LES DAWSON AT ONE POINT 
IT NEVER WAS GOING TO BE LES DAWSON 
BUT THAT WAS PROBABLY MY SECOND CHOICE I SUPPOSE 
I HAD WORKED WITH LES DAWSON ON A SKETCH SERIES AT THE B. B. C. 
I KNEW HIM TO BE YOU KNOW 
QUITE A HALF DECENT ACTOR 
AND CERTAINLY A VERY QUICK STUDY 
AND VERY FUNNY IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING CLEARLY IN RETROSPECT 
ONE WOULD NEVER HAVE GOT ALL THE DEPTH AND THE PATHOS AND EVERYTHING BECAUSE HE WASN'T AN ACTOR 
IN THE END WE THOUGHT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK TO RICHARD 
AND SEE IF WE CAN TWIST HIS ARM WHICH WE EVENTUALLY DID 
I THINK IF HE WERE HERE HE'D PROBABLY SAY 
WELL HE HAD ONLY SEEN TWO OR THREE SCRIPTS TO BEGIN WITH 
AND WASN'T QUITE SURE WHERE IT WAS GOING AND WHAT I WAS GETTING AT 
AND WAS IT JUST A VERY UNSYMPATHETIC MAN WHO SHOUTED AT PEOPLE A LOT WITH NO GOOD REASON 
HE CAME IN TO TALK TO US TO CHAT TO US A BIT MORE ABOUT IT 
AND I WAS MEANWHILE STILL WRITING THE SCRIPT BECAUSE THE B. B. C. HAD GIVEN IT THE GO AHEAD 
THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE IT COME WHAT MAY AND I WAS GETTING MORE AND MORE DISPIRITED 
WHAT'S THE POINT IT MAKING IT IF WE HAVEN'T GOT THE RIGHT ACTOR IN THE LEAD ROLE 
AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO SHOW HIM MORE MATERIAL 
AND EVENTUALLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PRECISE TURNING POINT WAS FOR HIM 
I THINK HIS AGENT WAS QUITE UM PERSUASIVE I'M NOT SURE 
BUT ANYWAY ONE DAY WE GOT THE PHONE CALL RICHARD'S AGREED TO DO IT 
AND WE BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF 
AND THE REASON IT TOOK OFF TO THE EXTENT THAT IT DID 
THIS WAS LONG BEFORE SERIES SUCH AS GRUMPY OLD MEN 
A LOT OF PEOPLE IDENTIFIED WITH THAT CHARACTER 
AND THAT PHRASE I DON'T BELIEVE IT 
IT CAME TO STAND FOR WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE FELT 
THAT THINGS THAT THEY'D BEEN CERTAIN ABOUT FOR SO LONG 
THEY WERE VANISHING AT THAT POINT 
YES I SUPPOSE THERE MUST HAVE BEEN ALL THAT 
ELEMENT THERE WAS AN ELEMENT IN IT 
UM 
I MEAN I'M ALWAYS WARY OF ATTRIBUTING TOO MUCH TO THE YOU KNOW 
THE ARGUMENT OF TAPPING INTO THE NATIONAL ZEITGEIST 
COS OF COURSE IT CAN DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS 
THAT SHOW COULD HAVE DONE ALL OF THOSE THINGS 
AND STILL NOT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IT COULD HAVE BEEN A DRAMA AND DONE ALL OF THOSE THINGS 
I'VE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THAT THE SUCCESS IT DID ACHIEVE 
WAS BECAUSE IT WAS FUNNY OR FUNNY TO THE PEOPLE THAT FIND IT FUNNY BUT FUNNY TO ENOUGH PEOPLE 
AND WITHOUT THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE ACHIEVED THE POPULARITY THAT WE DID ACHIEVE 
AND OF COURSE THAT RAGE THAT HE PERSONIFIED 
WAS I SUPPOSE ESSENTIALLY MY RAGE 
AND I SUPPOSE I LIKE TO THINK I WAS JUST REFLECTING ON SOMETHING THAT WAS COMMON AT THE TIME 
WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE 
CERTAINLY LITTER I USED TO BANG ON ABOUT LITTER TO SUCH AN EXTENT 
IN THAT FIRST SERIES THAT I BECAME AWARE 
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET SICK OF THE FACT THAT I'M GOING ON ABOUT LITTER 
THERE'S A SCENE IN THE VERY FINAL EPISODE WHERE MARGARET'S COLLECTING LITTER FROM THE HEDGEROWS 
AND THIS IS ALL BORN 
A PUBLIC SPIRITED UM EXERCISE 
IT WAS BORN OF SOMETHING I DID 
WHEN I WAS SO FED UP WITH ALL OF THE MANGLED CANS AND CRISP PACKETS 
AND KENTUCKY FRIED WRAPPERS IN THE HEDGEROWS 
DOWN NEAR HERTFORDSHIRE WHERE I LIVE 
I WENT OUT WITH A BLACK REFUSE BAG AND ONCE YOU START THAT EXERCISE GOD YOU KNOW 
THERE'S CAR BATTERIES AND PIECES OF BUMPERS AND THINGS 
AND YOU THINK I CAN'T COPE WITH THIS I'M SORT OF 
AND SAYS ARE YOU A FARMER 
YOU THINK THAT SHE'S GOING TO SAY YOU'RE DOING A VERY GOOD JOB GOOD LUCK TO YOU 
SHE SAYS ARE YOU A FARMER I SAID NO ONLY THERE'S A DEAD SHEEP UP THE ROAD 
WELL I'LL PUT THAT IN MY BAG I LOOKED ROUND AND SHE'D DRIVEN OFF 
AND YOU'VE NEVER BEEN OBVIOUSLY A CATCHPHRASE WRITER 
BUT THAT IS THE ONE TO THE EXTENT THAT RICHARD WILSON NOW WILL ONLY DO IT VERY OCCASIONALLY 
AND FOR CHARITY IF PEOPLE PAY A LARGE SUM OF MONEY 
WHEN YOU FIRST TYPED IT DID YOU THINK OF IT AS A CATCHPHRASE 
OF COURSE NOT NO I MEAN ABSOLUTELY NOT 
AND I WASN'T AWARE THAT I'D BEEN USING IT 
BUT THE IDEA THAT I'D INVENTED THIS CATCHPHRASE 
I MEAN 
YOU KNOW IT'S A PHRASE THAT IS IN YOU KNOW POPULAR USE 
AND THERE WERE MANY VARIANTS ON IT 
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT CAN YOU 
SOMEWHERE MAYBE IT WAS AFTER TWO SERIES HAD BEEN OUT I CAN'T REMEMBER 
THAT I SAW IT ACTUALLY QUOTED IN A PRESS REVIEW OR AN ARTICLE ABOUT RICHARD OR SOMETHING 
WITH THREE E.'S IN THE BELIEVE IT YOU THINK HE DOES SAY THAT A LOT DOESN'T HE 
A LOT OF SITCOMS AS WE KNOW IT'S THE SAME STRUCTURE THE SAME SITUATION WEEK AFTER WEEK 
YEAR AFTER YEAR NOW YOU ALWAYS GOT AWAY FROM THAT 
MOST FAMOUSLY THE EPISODE THAT'S SET IN THE TRAFFIC JAM 
PUT SOME MUSIC ON OR SOMETHING 
THERE'S A BLOKE WE CAN'T STAND ANY LONGER 
ALWAYS ON THE BLEEDIN' MOAN 
EVERY TIME WE MEND HIS BLOODY HONDA 
HE'S THERE GROUSING ON THE PHONE 
VICTOR MELDREW 
VICTOR MELDREW 
HE CAN STICK IT UP HIS BUM UP HIS BUM 
HE CAN BUGGER OFF TO KINGDOM COME 
IF THERE ARE RULES OF SITCOM WHICH THERE CLEARLY ARE IN SOME PLACES THAT WAS BREAKING ALL OF THEM 
MAYBE I GUESS I DON'T KNOW 
THERE WERE PRECEDENTS FOR YOU KNOW THE CLAUSTROPHOBIC UM SINGLE SCENE EPISODE 
OBVIOUSLY FAMOUSLY THE HANCOCK BEDSIT EPISODE 
UM I THINK THERE WAS AN EPISODE OF PORRIDGE CALLED AN EVENING IN 
WHERE THERE WERE JUST THE TWO OF THEM IN THE CELL FOR THE WHOLE EPISODE 
SO I WOULD NEVER CLAIM TO HAVE SORT OF STARTED IT OFF 
EVEN IN THOSE TWO YOU MENTIONED THE HANCOCK AND THE PORRIDGE 
YOU WERE SEEING THE BASIC SET THAT THEY HAD 
YOU WENT TOTALLY OUTSIDE 
IN THE MOTORWAY ONE YEAH YES 
AND ONE OF THE THINGS I THOUGHT WAS REALLY QUITE INTERESTING AND BRAVE OF SUSIE WHO DIRECTED IT 
WAS THAT THE CAMERA NEVER LEFT THE CAR 
EXCEPT FOR THE VERY FIRST AND VERY FINAL SHOTS WHEN WE WERE OUTSIDE IT 
WE ZOOMED IN AND ZOOMED OUT BUT WITH THE REST OF THE SHOW 
WE NEVER CUT OUTSIDE THE CAR EVEN WHEN THEY CHANGE PLACES 
THE CAMERA STILL STAYED AND YOU JUST SAW THE BACK OF THEM WALKING ROUND THE BACK OF THE WINDSCREEN 
AND THEN COMING BACK INTO THE FRONT AGAIN WE NEVER WENT OUTSIDE THE CAR 
THUS REINFORCING THE WHOLE UM 
CLAUSTROPHOBIA OF THE INTERIOR OF THE VEHICLE 
BUT YOUR ATTENTION TO STRUCTURE THE FINAL EPISODE VICTOR DIES BUT AGAIN 
UNUSUAL FOR A SITCOM TO KILL OFF A CENTRAL CHARACTER BUT MOST OF THEM WOULD HAVE GONE IN THE LINEAR WAY 
AND THEY WOULD HAVE DIED AT THE END 
IT STARTS FIVE MONTHS AFTER HIS DEATH IT'S DONE IN A SERIES OF INTERLOCKING FLASHBACKS 
THAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF YOUR ATTENTION TO STRUCTURE YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT IN THE OBVIOUS WAY 
NO UM IT'S PARTLY THAT IT'S PARTLY 
JUST THE OLD YOU KNOW IMPERATIVE OF WHAT CAN WE DO THAT'S DIFFERENT 
WHAT CAN WE DO THAT'S GONNA SURPRISE THE 
BECAUSE NO ONE ALMOST NO ONE IS GONNA COME TO THIS EPISODE 
THE FINAL EPISODE OF ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE AND NOT KNOW THAT VICTOR DIES IN IT THAT'LL BE COMMON KNOWLEDGE 
SO HOW CAN WE DO SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO SURPRISE THEM 
A LOT OF WRITERS PARTICULARLY INSECURE ONES PRONE TO ANXIETY 
WOULD HAVE KEPT THEIR MOST LUCRATIVE CHARACTER ALIVE 
IN CASE OF A RAINY DAY LATER ON IN THE CAREER 
BUT I'M INTERESTED THAT YOU KILLED HIM OFF YEAH 
NO WELL I WANTED TO KILL HIM OFF VERY MUCH BECAUSE OF THAT INSECURITY 
THE INSECURITY THAT I MIGHT BE ASKED TO WRITE SOME MORE AH 
AND I COULD POINT TO NO BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE HE'S DEAD YOU CAN'T MAKE ME WRITE ANY MORE 
OR PUT ME THROUGH THAT AGONY OF TRYING TO COME UP WITH ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE IDEAS WHICH I'M BARREN OF 
TWENTY FIVE HOURS OF ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE ALSO THEN TWENTY FIVE OF JONATHAN CREEK 
NOW AGAIN THE SENSE OF STRUCTURE EVEN MORE SO IN CREEK 
BECAUSE THEY ARE INCREDIBLY INTRICATE PUZZLES WHICH CLEARLY DRAW ON THE LOCKED ROOM MYSTERIES YES 
THE ABSOLUTE STARTING POINT WAS I WANT TO DO COLUMBO 
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S MORE ABOUT THE PUZZLE 
THAN ABOUT CAR CHASES ESSENTIALLY AND YOU KNOW WITH HUMOUR 
UM BUT HAVING SORT OF GOT THAT FAR 
I REALISED I NEEDED A LITTLE BIT MORE IN TERMS OF CONCEPT TO GO ON 
AND SO I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN THE IMPOSSIBLE CRIME GENRE 
AND THERE WERE A LOT OF FATHER BROWN G. K. CHESTERTON STORIES THAT DEALT WITH THOSE KINDS OF PUZZLES 
SO I THOUGHT AND STILL THINK IT WASN'T BEING DONE WHO'S DONE IT 
IT'S NOT ON THE AIR THERE ARE NO DETECTIVE SHOWS THAT ARE ABOUT 
THERE MIGHT BE THE ODD EPISODE HERE AND THERE THAT YOU KNOW 
MAYBE TOUCHES ON A LOCKED ROOM 
BUT AS A GENRE AS A PREMISE YOU KNOW FOR THE WHOLE PROJECT 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING ANYONE'S DONE 
SO THAT GIVES ME SOMETHING ELSE GO ON AS IT'S UNCHARTED TERRITORY 
AND UM SO STARTING FROM THAT POINT 
THAT WAS WHAT LED ME BACKWARDS TO THE WHOLE REALM OF MAGIC AND ILLUSION 
BECAUSE THAT SUGGESTED A CHARACTER WHO WORKED IN THAT TRADE THAT INDUSTRY 
BECAUSE THAT WOULD THEN GIVE HIM THE QUALIFICATION 
TO UM YOU KNOW TO UNRAVEL THOSE MYSTERIES 
SO THAT WAS WHERE IT ALL BEGAN 
SOMETHING VERY ODD GOING ON 
THINGS THAT DON'T GEL AND I CAN'T SAY WHY 
LIKE THAT MANUSCRIPT HE READ OUT WHY DO I GET THE FEELING ALL THE WORDS IN IT WERE WRONG 
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE'S PLAYING A VERY ELABORATE GAME HERE AND UNTIL WE FIND OUT WHO 
WE'LL BE WELL ADVISED TO WATCH OUR BACKS AND KEEP THAT PASSWORD TO OURSELVES I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
I DEFINITELY GET THE 
I'M SORRY DID I MISS SOMETHING 
SIXTY SIX YEAR 
OH COME ON IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE 
YOU GOT HALFWAY THERE WHEN YOU WERE TALKING THE NUMBERS AS WORDS 
TRY THINKING ABOUT THE NUMBERS AS LETTERS 
ROMAN NUMERALS FOR SIX ARE 
THE SIXTH 
AND HOW'S YOUR FRENCH FOR YEAR 
ANNEE OR A. N. S. 
GO WITH A. N. S. 
THE SIXTH THE SIXTH A N 
OH 
HOW EXTREMELY BORING 
YOU'D THINK SHE WOULD HAVE COME UP WITH SOMETHING A BIT MORE IMAGINATIVE 
THAN HER OWN CHRISTIAN NAM AGH 
JONATHAN 
AGH 
A LOT OF COMEDY IS VERBAL FRIENDS FOR EXAMPLE IS VIRTUALLY ALL VERBAL 
AND ALL YOU SEE ARE THE CHARACTERS 
BUT THERE'S A VERY STRONG VISUAL SENSE IN YOUR COMEDY 
IN ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE 
LITTLE THROWAWAY IN THAT FINAL EPISODE A TABLE MADE OUT OF A TURTLE 
AND THERE'S THE ONE AGAIN A THROWAWAY REFERENCE AT THE END 
MRS. WARBOYS HAS BEEN TO A WAXWORKS AND WON A PRIZE ON HOLIDAY 
AND THEN THERE'S A GIANT VISION OF HER OUTSIDE THE HOUSE 
JONATHAN CREEK LIVES IN A WINDMILL WE'RE OFTEN SEEING IMPOSSIBLE THINGS 
YOU THINK WHICH IT SEEMS ODD TO SAY 
BUT SOME TELEVISION WRITERS DON'T YOU THINK VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THE VISUAL ASPECT I DO YES 
ENORMOUSLY OTHERWISE I THINK YOU'RE JUST WRITING RADIO SCRIPTS ALL THE WHILE 
AND I MEAN I CAN'T SPEAK FOR ANYONE ELSE'S APPROACH 
BUT TELEVISION IS IN THEORY IT IS A VISUAL MEDIUM 
AND YOU KNOW FOR GOD'S SAKE LET'S USE IT 
I REMEMBER CLEESE SAYING AGES AGO I THINK QUITE PERCEPTIVELY 
WITH MOST AFFECTION AND WILL LAUGH AT AGAIN AND AGAIN ARE VISUAL 
THEY TEND TO BE VISUAL MOMENTS 
ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE WAS AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL IN THE SENSE OF THE RAGE 
AND THE OBSESSION WITH LITTER 
LOVE SOUP IN A HAPPIER WAY WAS ALSO AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL 
BECAUSE IT WAS ABOUT PEOPLE WAITING A LONG TIME TO TRY TO FIND LOVE 
BUT THAT HAD HAPPENED TO YOU 
YES WELL UM I MEAN WHERE DID LOVE SOUP START 
IT STARTED WITH THE TITLE I THINK 
IT'S PATHETIC AS THAT MOMENT OF STEPPING OUT OF THE SHOWER ONE DAY AND THINKING 
BECAUSE I PERSONALLY HAD FOUND A RELATIONSHIP FOUND SOMEONE 
QUITE LATE IN LIFE WE WERE BOTH ABOUT FORTY 
WHO AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IS YOU KNOW 
COULD NOT BE A MORE PERFECT MATCH FOR ME AND ME FOR HER 
UM IN ABSOLUTELY EVERY RESPECT 
THERE'S THIS KIND OF ONE HUNDRED PER CENT COMPATIBILITY 
THAT WE YOU KNOW KIND OF COALESCE ON 
AND WHEN WE COMPARE NOTES ABOUT PREVIOUS PARTS OF OUR LIVES 
UM 
YOU KNOW WE HAVE FOR INSTANCE A VERY SIMILAR PREOCCUPATION ABOUT TIME 
AND THE PASSAGE OF TIME WHICH HAS BEEN SOMETHING 
THAT I'VE KIND OF USED IN ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE 
THERE WAS AN EPISODE AND THERE WAS A WHOLE EPISODE OF JONATHAN CREEK ABOUT A MAN WHO HAD A PHOBIA ABOUT TIME 
TOOK THE HANDS OFF HIS CLOCKS 
DOES SHE SHARE THE LITTER OBSESSION YEAH 
ABSOLUTELY YES IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS 
AND UM YOU KNOW I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY ANYONE WOULDN'T OF COURSE 
THAT'S MY TAKE 
BUT THERE WAS A MOMENT IN IT WAS IN THE BEDROOM EPISODE OF ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE 
WHERE HE'S JUST OBSESSED WITH THE FACT THAT MOMENTS ARE PASSING AS WE SPEAK YOU KNOW 
AND THAT THAT'S IN THE PAST NOW THAT MOMENT WHERE I JUST SAID THAT 
AND THE MOMENT WHEN I JUST SAID THAT'S IN THE PAST THAT'S IN THE PAST NOW 
AND HE'S DRIVING MARGARET COMPLETELY BATTY SAYING ALL THIS BUT THERE'S A POINT TO ALL THAT 
WHICH IS MY YOU KNOW ABSOLUTE 
AND A FRIEND OF ELLIE'S WHO HAD KNOWN HER OBVIOUSLY LONG BEFORE I MET HER 
SAID I SEE YOU GAVE HIM THAT IDEA FOR THE NO HE WROTE ALL THAT BEFORE 
SHE HAD SAID EXACTLY THE SAME THING 
SO I FELT IT WAS QUITE UNCANNY THAT I'D MANAGED TO MEET THIS ONE 
SO THEN I JUST THOUGHT WELL IS THERE A SERIES IN THESE TWO PEOPLE 
UM YOU KNOW BEFORE THEY MEET 
AND SO IT'S LIKE IT'S TWO IT'S TWO HALF HOURS EVERY WEEK 
WITHIN THIS HOUR LONG FORMAT 
SEEING THE TWO OF THEM EXPERIENCING ALL THESE OTHER RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE 
IT'S NEVER GONNA WORK BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS GOD LIKE SUBJECTIVITY 
THIS OVERVIEW OF THE TWO OF THEM AND THEY DON'T KNOW 
EACH TIME THEY MEET SOMEONE NEW 
THEY THINK THIS COULD BE THE ONE 
WE KNOW IT ISN'T BUT WE SEE WE SEE WE DOVETAIL 
SO THAT WAS QUITE A HIGH CONCEPT IDEA UM 
IT WAS ALSO HIGH RISK I REMEMBER INTERVIEWING YOU FOR RADIO BEFORE IT STARTED 
AND I'D SEEN THE FIRST TWO 
AND I SAID IT'S VERY BRAVE THE WAY IN WHICH YOU DELAY THE MOMENT WHEN THEY MEET 
AND YOU SAID WELL THEY MAY NOT MEET 
THEY MAY NOT MEET AT ALL AND I THOUGHT HE'S TEASING ME 
BUT AGAIN IT'S NOT PLOT SPOILING NOW BECAUSE IT'S OUT ON D. V. D. 
THEY NEVER DID MEET WAS THERE ANY RESISTANCE FROM THIS IN THE DRAMA DEPARTMENT 
NO NO I. IT LED QUITE A CHARMED LIFE BETWEEN THE B. B. C. DRAMA DEPARTMENT I HAVE TO SAY 
AFTER AN INITIAL LITTLE SORT OF SKIRMISH 
AFTER SERIES ONE ABOUT THE MUSIC 
SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT KIND OF MUSIC TO PUT ON 
BUT AFTER THAT I WAS PRETTY MUCH LEFT ALONE 
AND WE NO I DON'T THINK ANYONE I MEAN THERE WAS A THERE WERE THINGS LIKE SHOULD HE BE AMERICAN 
WE'RE NOT SURE HE SHOULD BE AMERICAN 
UM BUT UM THAT'S ANOTHER WHOLE ISSUE 
BUT I QUITE LIKE THE FACT THAT HE WAS AMERICAN 
I LIKE WRITING IN THE AMERICAN IDIOM 
IN THAT THE TWO CHARACTERS WERE ESSENTIALLY BASED UPON MY WIFE AND MYSELF 
THE ALICE CHARACTER IS VERY VERY CLOSELY BASED UPON ELLIE 
AND DOES EXACTLY THE JOB THAT SHE USED TO DO 
IN YOU KNOW WORKING IN A FRAGRANCE CONCESSION WITHIN A MAJOR SUPERMARKET 
SHE WORKED IN HARRODS AND SELFRIDGES 
AND A LOT IS DRAWN FROM HER EXPERIENCE THERE 
HE'S A WRITER AND BUT APART FROM THE FACT THAT HE'S A WRITER 
AND THE FACT THAT HE'S AN INCREDIBLY HANDSOME AMERICAN NONE OF THAT CORRESPONDS TO ME AT ALL 
BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE BITS AND PIECES FROM HIS STORIES WHICH YOU KNOW 
WHICH EMANATE FROM MY LIFE 
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I DON'T THINK THERE WAS EVER A POINT AT WHICH ANYONE WITHIN THE B. B. C. SAID 
BUT HOW CAN YOU NOT HAVE THEM MEET AT THE END 
BUT THE PUBLIC WE GOT THAT REACTION FROM THE PUBLIC 
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT WENT OUT ON THE NET 
YOU KNOW AND THE B. B. C. WEBSITE 
THERE WAS ONE I REMEMBER SAYING I REALLY REALLY LOVED LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT HIS SHOW 
I WAS REALLY GLUED TO IT FROM THE WORD GO 
BUT THEN WHEN THEY DIDN'T MEET AT THE END I THOUGHT THIS IS SUCH A COP OUT 
AND EVEN IF IT DOES COME BACK I SHAN'T BE WATCHING IT FOR ONE 
YOU THINK WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY HAVE GOT OUT OF THIS SHOW 
THERE'S A LOT OF I NOTICED WATCHING THE LATER PARTS OF ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE 
AND THEN LOVE SOUP 
A LOT OF HEALTH ANXIETY A LOT OF BLOOD PRESSURE BEING TAKEN YES 
IS THAT YOU OH GOD YES YEAH HYPOCHONDRIA YOU KNOW IN A BIG BIG WAY 
I MEAN THE MEDICAL ENCYCLOPAEDIA THE MEDICAL DICTIONARY OF SYMPTOMS 
THAT OCCURS ON MANY OCCASIONS IS MINE 
IS MY PERSONAL COPY 
WHICH IS WHY IT IS SO WELL THUMBED IT'S NOT THAT THE PROPS DEPARTMENT 
HAVE GONE THROUGH IT AND BROKEN DOWN A VIRGINAL BOOK AND MADE IT LOOK 
THAT'S ME GOING THROUGH IT ALL ABSOLUTELY 
AND HIS LINE WELL WHY BOTHER LOOKING BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT ALL OFF BY HEART ANY WAY 
IS JUST COMPLETELY ME I THINK THAT WHAT'S THE WORST THING YOU'VE THOUGHT YOU'VE HAD 
UM OH GOD PROBABLY BOWEL CANCER I THINK 
I THINK THERE W. A S. NINETEEN NINETY W. H. E. N. WAS IT NINETY FIVE OR SOMETHING I THINK WAS 
THAT WAS I MEAN PEOPLE WILL RECOGNISE THIS FROM AN EPISODE 
WAS THAT THE TESTS CAME BACK POSITIVE 
JUST FROM A ROUTINE BUPA EXAMINATION 
SO THEN YOU GO THROUGH OBVIOUSLY WEEKS OF THEN YOU GO BACK 
AND I WENT FOR THE FOR THE EXAMINATION 
ACTUALLY IT WASN'T EVEN AN EXAMINATION IT WAS MORE OF A CONSULTATION 
WHICH IS WHAT VICTOR WENT THROUGH AND HE SAID AT THE TIME 
WELL WE CAN PERFORM THE COLONOSCOPY NOW IF YOU YOU KNOW IT'S YOUR BODY IF YOU WANT TO 
OR YOU CAN GO AWAY AND DO THE TEST AGAIN 
AND TO BE HONEST IF IT COMES BACK YOU'VE GOT NO REAL SYMPTOMS IF IT COMES BACK AGAIN CLEAR 
THEN I DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT ANY FURTHER 
SO I SO IT WAS LIKE VICTOR EYEING THE MACHINERY 
I THOUGHT WELL I'LL GO AWAY AND TAKE THE TEST AGAIN I THINK 
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCEDURE CALLED A COLONOSCOPY 
VICTOR 
WHAT DID HE SAY WELL IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT 
THEY GAVE ME A SEDATIVE 
WHILE THEY PUT THIS THING LIKE A LONG TUBE WITH A SPARKLER ON THE END 
RIGHT UP INSIDE AND 
WHAT DID THEY FIND 
MRS. WARBOYS' BLACK PUDDINGS 
IT WAS QUITE A NICE DOVETAILING I FELT THAT I DID THERE 
WITH IN HIS SOLO EPISODE THE TRIAL WHERE HE'S ON HIS OWN 
IT WAS LIKE A HYPOCHONDRIA YOU KNOW WORRYING ABOUT HIS OWN HEALTH 
AND UM HYPOCHONDRIA ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSE 
HE WAS WORRIED THAT THERE WAS SUBSIDENCE 
UM AND THIS WAS SOMETHING I WAS GOING THROUGH AS WELL AT THE TIME 
IN FACT THERE WAS SUBSIDENCE IN MY HOUSE PART OF THE EXTENSION HAD TO BE DEMOLISHED AND REBUILT 
AND I WAS FOREVER GOING ROUND MEASURING CRACKS AND YOU KNOW 
ROMAN POLANSKI OR SOMETHING IN THE WALLS YOU KNOW 
HAS THAT GOT ANY BIGGER YOU KNOW 
AND IT WAS ALMOST LIKE MEASURING 
BUT I USED TO IN THE EIGHTIES 
I USED TO I USED TO DRAW I USED TO DO DRAWINGS 
PLOTTING WHERE ALL THE MOLES WERE ON MY BACK 
AND ALL THE POSITIONS 
AND I USED TO STAND IN FRONT OF A CAMERA 
SET UP YOU KNOW ON SELF TIMER 
AND PHOTOGRAPH SO THAT I COULD THEN LOOK BACK AND COMPARE 
IF I FELT IS THIS A NEW ONE HAS THAT GROWN 
I HAD MEASUREMENTS I HAD THE CALIBRATIONS OF THE 
I MEAN THIS IS HOW BAD IT HAS BEEN IN MY LIFE 
AND YOU KNOW I SIT HERE AND I LAUGH AT IT 
WHICH IS WHY IN SOMETHING LIKE HANNAH AND HER SISTERS 
WHEN WOODY ALLEN DOES THAT LINE I HAD A MELANOMA ON MY BACK 
IT WAS ON YOUR SHIRT YES BUT BUT HOW DID I KNOW 
AND THAT WAS SUCH A FUNNY MOMENT 
BECAUSE I HAD THIS LINE I NEVER USED IT BUT SOMEONE SAID ONCE 
IF YOU CAN COVER IT IF YOU CAN COVER THE SPOT WITH THE END OF A PENCIL THEN YOU'RE SAFE 
AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE POINT WHICH IS WHAT I NEVER ACTUALLY USED THAT ONE 
IT'S TO COME IN AT SOME POINT 
BUT I I MEAN AGAIN ELLIE IS SHE SUFFERS FROM THE SAME HYPOCHONDRIA 
WE WE RETAIN 
THE STATUS OF AN INDEPENDENT CONCESSION 
AS FAR AS SALES AND THE TRADING ASPECT OF IT ALL 
WHAT WHAT WHAT IS IT WHAT CAN YOU FEEL NOTHING NO NOTHING 
YES YOU CAN YOU'RE A DOCTOR OR TRAINING TO BE ONE WHAT DID YOU FEEL DOWN THERE 
CALM DOWN ALICE GOD YOU'RE AS NERVOUS AS A KITTEN 
I AM AREN'T I SORRY IT'S JUST 
DO YOU THINK I COULD USE YOUR TOILET 
ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY 
OH GOD LOOK I'M SORRY I SHOULDN'T HAVE UM 
OH MY GOD 
COMING BACK ROUND TO WHERE WE STARTED WHICH IS THAT ANY THING CAN GO WRONG 
IT WILL PREPARE FOR THE WORST THAT DID HAPPEN ON LOVE SOUP TWO 
WELL YES IT HAS UNDERGONE SOMETHING OF A TRANSFORMATION 
UM BY DINT OF THE FACT THAT WE LOST OUR LEADING MAN 
WHICH YOU KNOW REGULAR VIEWERS OF THE SERIES WILL THINK 
MM I WONDER THAT'S THE AMERICAN GUY YES I WONDER QUITE HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK THEN 
GIVEN THE SERIES IS ABOUT THESE TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE SPECIFICALLY 
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE A GRIM PHONE CALL WHEN YOU WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS QUITE YES 
UM I MEAN YOU'D WRITTEN THE SCRIPTS SUFFICE TO SAY WE WERE QUITE WELL ADVANCED 
UM IN TERMS OF THE MATERIAL AND INDEED PRODUCTION PLANNING 
AND MICHAEL LANDES WHO PLAYS GIL 
UM HAD BEEN OFFERED ANOTHER JOB 
WHICH HE WAS HOPING WOULD NOT CONFLICT WITH OUR SCHEDULE 
AND WAS HOPING THAT SOMEHOW THE B. B. C. COULD FIND A WAY TO JUGGLE DATES 
AND THAT THE TWO WERE GOING TO COEXIST HAPPILY AND THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE TWO 
SO I MEAN HE WAS ALWAYS VERY VERY KEEN TO REPRISE THE ROLE 
UM SADLY THAT WASN'T THE CASE 
AND THERE WAS A POINT WHERE I MEAN I WAS ESSENTIALLY FACED WITH A DECISION 
DO WE STAND THE PRODUCTION DOWN THIS WAS BEFORE CHRISTMAS LAST YEAR 
UM THERE WAS A CHRISTMAS DRINKS SESSION THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN SCHEDULED FOR THE CREW 
AND THE PRODUCTION TEAM 
AND VERITY LAMBERT THE PRODUCER HAD UM HAD GOT TO CALL EVERYBODY TOGETHER 
AND EITHER SHE WAS GOING TO SAY HERE'S THE CHAMPAGNE AND THE MINCE PIES BY THE WAY 
DON'T COME BACK AFTER CHRISTMAS OR ELSE 
WE'VE HIT A BIT OF A HICCUP 
BUT DAVID HAS DECIDED THAT THE SHOW WILL GO AHEAD IN A DIFFERENT FORM 
AND HE'S GOING TO UM LOOK AT THE SCRIPTS AGAIN 
AND IT WILL GO AHEAD 
UM BUT THERE WILL BE THIS KIND OF REINVENTION 
AND UM SO WE KEPT IT ALL ON TRACK 
AND I THINK THAT WHAT HAS EMERGED AS A RESULT IS UM 
YOU KNOW I'M VERY PLEASED WITH 
AND IT'S WHAT YOU WERE SAYING EARLIER ABOUT THE JUST UM CONSTRAINTS 
AND THE EVENTS REAL LIFE EVENTS DICTATING VERY OFTEN THOUGH 
THE COURSE THAT YOUR WORK TAKES 
TRICKY TIMES FOR TELEVISION 
DRAMA HASN'T BEEN ACCUSED OF FAKING THINGS YET 
BUT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS DOCUMENTARY AND NEWS 
T. V. IS SAID TO BE IN CRISIS 
SOME SAY TELEVISION IS DYING IT'LL BE LITTLE EPISODES FOR MOBILE PHONES IN THE FUTURE 
DO YOU FEEL DEPRESSED ABOUT T. V. YES YES 
I FEEL DEPRESSED ABOUT LIFE GENERALLY 
I MEAN YOU SAY THAT DRAMA HASN'T BEEN EFFECTED 
OUR PRODUCER VERITY LITERALLY GOT AN ENQUIRY FROM THE B. B. C. SAYING 
TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIRST SERIES OF LOVE SOUP WAS THERE EVER ANY ATTEMPT TO MISLEAD PEOPLE 
WELL YES YES FROM THE BEGINNING TO END ACTUALLY YOU KNOW 
ACTUALLY TAMSIN GREIG DOESN'T WORK IN A DEPARTMENT STORE SHE'S AN ACTRESS 
YOU KNOW AND I JUST THINK THEY'VE GOT SO UP THEMSELVES 
AND THEY'RE SO YOU KNOW SELF REFLECTIVE ABOUT IT ALL 
AND I FIND TO BE QUITE HONEST THAT IS UNDER THE HEADING OF DON'T GET ME STARTED 
I MEAN WHEN A B. B. C. ONE CONTROLLER HAS TO YOU KNOW RESIGN 
AND VARIOUS BLAIRS ARE CLINGING TO THEIR JOBS IN THE FACE OF ALL KINDS OF HUMAN ATROCITIES 
I FEEL THE WORLD IS ESSENTIALLY INSANE 
I MEAN I THINK THERE ARE VERY GOOD REASONS TO GET ANGRY 
ABOUT PHONE INS THAT ARE FRAUDULENT 
AND ARE BASICALLY STEALING MONEY OFF PEOPLE 
BUT SO MUCH OF THE REST OF IT I THINK IS SO UTTERLY TRIVIAL 
THERE'S A LINE IN LOVE SOUP ABOUT PACE YOURSELF YOU'LL HAVE NOTHING LEFT FOR MASS GENOCIDE 
I THINK OUR VALUES ARE SO WARPED NOW 
BUT OF COURSE WE SIT WE'VE BEEN EDITING LOVE SOUP IN THE WAKE OF ALL THIS 
AND WE SIT IN THERE SAYING WELL ARE YOU SURE WE SHOULD TRANSFER THAT WORD OVER FROM THERE TO THERE 
I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW WE'LL BE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SUN TOMORROW 
UM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT EDITING IS ALL ABOUT 
IT'S ALL FORCED IT'S ALL FAKERY THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF IT 
DAVID RENWICK THANK YOU THANK YOU
