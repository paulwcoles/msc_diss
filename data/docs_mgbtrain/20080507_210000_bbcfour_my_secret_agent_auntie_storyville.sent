ALL MY LIFE I'VE HAD ONE GREAT IDOL 
A RUSSIAN WOMAN NAME OF BARONESS BUDBERG 
SHE WAS BETTER KNOWN AS MOURA 
SHE WAS MY GREAT GREAT AUNT AND WHEN I TELL YOU HER STORY 
YOU'LL WISH SHE'D BEEN YOUR AUNT TOO 
THE EVENTS WHICH HER LIFE COVERED WERE ENORMOUS 
SHE WAS AT THE HEART OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION AT ITS HEIGHT 
QUITE APART FROM ALL THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED AFTERWARDS 
AUNT MOURA'S LIFE READS LIKE A COLD WAR THRILLER 
HER STORY WAS SO EXCITING THAT THE DIRECTOR OF CASABLANCA 
MADE A FILM ABOUT HER 
SHE HAD COUNTLESS ADVENTURES 
EVEN GOT CAUGHT UP IN A PLOT TO TOPPLE THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT 
THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF CONTROVERSY AS TO WHAT HER ACTUAL ROLE IN THESE EVENTS WAS 
SHE WAS THE LOVER OF FAMOUS MEN LIKE THE WRITER MAXIM GORKY 
SHE EVEN HAD H. G. WELLS ASKING HER TO MARRY HIM 
I SAID IF YOU DO THAT H. G. I'LL JUMP OUT OF THE TAXI WHILE IT'S RUNNING 
I NEVER MET HER BUT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN IN AWE OF HER 
A BIT LIKE THE GUESTS AT HER FAMOUS LONDON SALONS 
EVERYBODY PASSED THROUGH MOURA'S SALON 
FROM SOMERSET MAUGHAM TO ARNOLD BENNETT YOU NAME IT 
BUT THERE'S A DARK SIDE TO MOURA'S GLAMOUR AND FAME 
OVER FIVE DECADES 
SHE WAS INVESTIGATED BY EVERY MAJOR SECRET SERVICE IN EUROPE 
THE MEMBERS OF OUR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND OTHER WHO KNEW HER WELL 
HAD STRONG SUSPICIONS THAT SHE WAS A RUSSIAN AGENT 
AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE THAT MOURA MET TURNED OUT TO BE SOVIET SPIES 
EUROPE'S INTELLIGENCE NETWORKS SUSPECTED THAT AUNT MOURA WAS A CALLOUS DOUBLE AGENT 
SHE'S EVEN BEEN ACCUSED OF MURDER 
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO CLEAR AUNT MOURA'S NAME 
THE TROUBLE IS NOTHING'S CUT AND DRY IN THE MURKY WORLD OF ESPIONAGE 
AUNT MOURA HAS LONG BEEN AN OBJECT OF MALE FASCINATION 
JOURNALISTS WRITERS SPIES AND NOW GREAT GREAT NEPHEWS 
I'M THE LATEST IN A LONG LINE OF MEN WHO HAVE TRIED TO FIND OUT 
WAS SHE A VALUABLE INTELLIGENCE ASSET OR DID SHE JUST ACT LIKE ONE 
MOURA WAS ONE OF THE MOST SPIED ON WOMEN IN HISTORY 
BUT NO ONE EVER PROVED IF SHE WAS AN AGENT HERSELF 
NOT VERY ENCOURAGING FOR A NOVICE SPY CATCHER LIKE ME 
BROUGHT UP ON JOHN LE CARRE NOVELS 
AND MY FIRST LINE OF ENQUIRY COMES TO NOTHING 
MOURA'S SPYING IS A TABOO SUBJECT FOR SOME OF THE FAMILY 
YEAH 
EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE INTERVIEWED I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT 
I DON'T WANT ANY UNPLEASANTNESS EITHER 
I'M TOLD TO LET SLEEPING DOGS LIE 
YOU DON'T FEEL YOU WANT TO BE INVOLVED 
YES 
OH WELL AT LEAST MY MUM'S STILL TALKING TO ME 
AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER THERE'D BEEN GOSSIP ABOUT HER SPYING 
THERE WERE ALWAYS RUMOURS 
BUT I DON'T THINK ANY OF US REALLY TOOK IT SERIOUSLY 
MY MOTHER'S RECOLLECTIONS CAN'T UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY OF MOURA'S LIFE 
SO I TURN TO HER BRITISH FRIENDS 
IF YOU WENT TO HER APARTMENT 
YOU'D HEAR THIS TAPPING OF THE CANE COMING DOWN THE CORRIDOR 
SHE'D OPEN AND THEN SHE'D USUALLY GO AND SIT DOWN 
AND SAY WANT A DRINK THEY WERE USUALLY HER FIRST WORDS 
SHE COULD DRINK LIKE A FISH BUT THERE WAS NO SUGGESTION 
THAT IT IMPAIRED ANYTHING THAT SHE DID 
SHE COULD DRINK PEOPLE UNDER THE TABLE 
SHE ALWAYS ORGANISED HER LIFE SO THAT SHE HAD SOMEBODY TO GO OUT TO LUNCH WITH 
AND SOMEBODY TO GO OUT TO SUPPER WITH 
AND IF THERE WAS NOBODY AROUND 
SHE WOULD RING UP ALL HER FRIENDS AND SAY OH DARLING I MUST SEE YOU 
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU FOR SUCH AGES 
BUT YOU KNOW THE AWFUL THING IS I CAN ONLY DO TONIGHT 
SHE ALWAYS MANAGED TO PERSUADE SOMEBODY 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS REMEMBER HER KINDLY 
BUT WITHIN THEIR REMINISCENCES I STRIKE UPON A CLUE 
I ADORED HER BUT I DON'T THINK SHE KNEW THE MEANING OF THE WORD TRUTH 
H. G. WELLS USED TO CALL IT HER EASY WAY WITH FACT 
SHE HAD SO MANY THINGS TO SAY AND SOME OCCASIONALLY SHE INVENTED 
SHE DID INVENT THAT SHE WAS PRESENT AT THE PALACE 
WHEN AND WHERE RASPUTIN WAS MURDERED 
WHICH WAS REALLY NOT POSSIBLE AT ALL 
THE WAY HER FRIENDS SEE IT AUNT MOURA'S ACTIVE IMAGINATION 
MAKES IT UNLIKELY SHE REALLY WAS A SPY 
I CAN'T THINK THAT ANYTHING SERIOUS WOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO MOURA 
BECAUSE BY THE TIME IT CAME OUT THE OTHER END OF MOURA 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO TRANSFORMED ANYWAY 
BUT ALL SPIES ARE PRACTISED IN THE ART OF DECEPTION 
AND BRITISH INTELLIGENCE SUSPECTED THAT AUNT MOURA WAS A PROLIFIC AGENT 
HER FILE HAS BEEN DECLASSIFIED SO I GO AND TAKE A LOOK 
IT CONTAINS AN ARRAY OF SINISTER ALLEGATIONS 
NONE OF WHICH HAVE EVER BEEN PROVED 
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE MOURAS 
A PUBLIC MOURA WHOM HER FRIENDS DESCRIBED TO ME 
AND A COVERT MOURA WHO LIVES IN THE PAGES OF SECRET SERVICE DOSSIERS 
TO FIND OUT WHICH IS REAL I NEED TO START AT THE BEGINNING 
BEHIND THE OLD IRON CURTAIN 
THIS IS BEREZOVA RUDKA THE MANSION IN UKRAINE WHERE MY RUSSIAN FAMILY LIVED FOR GENERATIONS 
IT WAS ONCE A VERITABLE PALACE 
BUT IT NOW LOOKS CRUMBLING AND NEGLECTED 
IT IS ACTUALLY REALLY SAD I NEVER THOUGHT I'D FEEL SAD ABOUT IT BUT I DO 
LOOK AT THIS LOOK AT THIS 
I MEAN YOU KNOW THIS IS A HISTORIC BUILDING FROM THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
WHERE MY GRANDMOTHER WAS BORN AND LOOK AT IT 
THIS IS JUST FALLING APART 
MY ANCESTORS THE ZAKREVSKYS WERE WEALTHY LANDOWNERS 
BEREZOVA RUDKA WAS OUR SHOWPIECE ESTATE WHERE WE ENTERTAINED NOBLEMEN FROM ALL OVER THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE 
MARIA ZAKREVSKAYA WAS BORN HERE ON THIRD MARCH ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY TWO 
I HAD ALL THE ESSENCES OF WHAT I HAD NOW 
I WAS MISCHIEVOUS I THINK I 
EVEN THEN HAD THAT VERY STRONG INSTINCT 
OF SELF PRESERVATION WHICH I KEPT UNTIL NOW 
HER FATHER IGNATIY ZAKREVSKY WAS A SENATOR IN THE RUSSIAN COURT 
WHEN HE WASN'T HELPING RUN THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE HE LIKED DOTING ON HIS FAVOURITE DAUGHTER MOURA 
MOURA DIDN'T SPEND LONG IN THE COUNTRY 
A LIFE OF BOULES CHAMPAGNE AND CAVIAR WAS MORE HER STYLE 
IN NINETEEN ELEVEN SHE MARRIED A DIPLOMAT NAMED JOHANN BENCKENDORFF 
AND MOVED TO BERLIN WHERE HE WORKED AT THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY 
EVEN THE KAISER NOTICED MOURA BENCKENDORFF'S RAVISHING BEAUTY 
THE KAISER SAW HER AND SAID WHO IS THAT QUEEN OF SHEBA 
THAT'S HOW SHE STRUCK PEOPLE SHE MUST'VE BEEN WONDERFUL LOOKING STATUESQUE GRAND 
AUNT MOURA WOULD HAVE KEPT ON DANCING AT BERLIN'S HIGH SOCIETY PARTIES WERE IT NOT FOR WWI 
ALMOST OVERNIGHT SHE WENT FROM HONOURED GUEST TO HATED ENEMY 
IT WAS TERRIBLE BECAUSE THE CROWDS AT THE STATIONS BEGAN TO SHOUT 
GIVE US THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR WE'LL KILL THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR 
MOURA AND HER HUSBAND FLED TO SAINT PETERSBURG 
BUT THEY WERE SOON ENEMIES THERE AS WELL 
THE REVOLUTION OF NINETEEN SEVENTEEN WAS A DECLARATION OF WAR ON ARISTOCRATS LIKE MOURA 
HER EXTRAVAGANT LIFESTYLE CAME TO AN END 
SHE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF HISTORY I DON'T THINK SHE SAT AROUND BUCKING THE TREND 
I THINK SHE YOU KNOW IF THERE WAS A REVOLUTION THERE WAS A REVOLUTION IF THERE WAS A WAR THERE WAS A WAR 
MOURA'S LIFE HAD BEEN ONE OF ABUNDANCE 
NOW IT WAS ABOUT SURVIVAL 
SHE TURNED OUT TO BE QUITE A SURVIVOR 
MOST ARISTOCRATS WERE TRYING TO FLEE BUT AUNT MOURA FOUND HERSELF 
AT THE CENTRE OF THE OPENING BATTLE BETWEEN COMMUNISM AND THE WEST 
THAT'S WHEN SHE HAD HER FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE SOVIET SECRET POLICE 
THE K. G. B. FIRST TARGETED AUNT MOURA BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN 
THEY WEREN'T CALLED THE K. G. B. THEN EVERYONE CALLED THEM THE CHEKA 
AUNT MOURA'S FAMILY ESCAPED TO ESTONIA 
BUT SHE REMAINED IN SAINT PETERSBURG TO LOOK AFTER HER AILING MOTHER 
IT WAS A DANGEROUS TIME 
SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY SOMEBODY WHO WAS IN THE EYE OF THE STORM 
AND SHE RECOGNISED STRAIGHT AWAY THAT THE MORE INFORMATION SHE HAD 
IT WOULD STRENGTHEN HER POSITION 
MOURA HAD CONNECTIONS IN THE WESTERN EMBASSIES 
AND SHE DRIFTED AROUND WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE DIPLOMATIC SOCIAL SCENE 
AT A PARTY SHE CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF AN ENGLISHMAN 
BY THE NAME OF BRUCE LOCKHART 
THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE IN THE TOWN AND IN THE COUNTRY WAS SO DESPERATE 
THAT IT SOMEHOW STIRRED ME 
TO BE IMMENSELY ATTRACTED BY THAT MAN 
AND GRADUALLY THIS ATTRACTION TURNED INTO A LOVE 
MOURA SOON REALISED THAT LOCKHART WASN'T A RUN OF THE MILL DIPLOMAT 
THE BOLSHEVIKS HAD PULLED OUT OF WWI AND BRITAIN WANTED TO ENTICE THEM BACK IN 
BUT AS THEY DIDN'T RECOGNISE THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT 
THE BRITISH COULD NOT DISPATCH AN OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE 
SO THEY SENT LOCKHART TO NEGOTIATE AS AN UNOFFICIAL AMBASSADOR 
HIS TITLE BRITISH AGENT 
HE WAS NOT IN ANY WAY AN INTELLIGENCE AGENT 
BUT BECAUSE HIS OFFICIAL ROLE WAS BRITISH AGENT 
IT'S BEEN WIDELY ASSUMED BY MANY PEOPLE 
THAT THIS WAS JUST A VERY OVERT MANIFESTATION OF THE BRITISH INTELLIGENCE MACHINE 
MOURA AND LOCKHART WERE NOW LOVERS BUT HIS CHARMS WORKED BETTER ON HER THAN ON THE BOLSHEVIKS 
DESPITE HIS ADVANCES THEY STILL REFUSED TO RE ENTER THE WAR 
THIS PROMPTED A CHANGE OF STRATEGY AND A PLOT TO REMOVE HIM FROM POWER WAS SOON ON THE TABLE 
THINGS WOULD NOT GO ACCORDING TO PLAN 
AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONTROVERSY ABOUT THE ROLE AUNT MOURA PLAYED 
THERE ARE TWO POTENTIAL ROLES FOR MOURA ONE IS JUST AS THE MISTRESS OF BRUCE LOCKHART 
THE SECOND AREA THAT'S OF INTEREST IS THE POSSIBILITY THE RUMOURS HAVE CIRCULATED FOR YEARS 
THAT MOURA DENOUNCED BRUCE LOCKHART 
AND WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS INCARCERATION 
I'VE BEEN IN MOSCOW A WHILE NOW LOOKING AT THE ARCHIVES 
TRYING TO FIND SOME DOCUMENTS WHICH SHED LIGHT ON WHAT HAPPENED 
THE K. G. B. MUST HAVE FILES ON AUNT MOURA BUT THEY STILL AREN'T KEEN ON ENGLISH VISITORS 
IF I'M GOING TO GET HOLD OF HER DOSSIER I'LL NEED A RUSSIAN AGENT 
A CONTACT HAS ARRANGED A MEETING WITH A FORMER K. G. B. COLONEL 
WHO KNOWS HIS WAY AROUND THE ARCHIVES 
I'M LOOKING TO RECRUIT HIM 
COLONEL PRELIN'S FIRST MISSION IS TO FIND OUT IF AUNT MOURA ENDED UP WORKING FOR THE BOLSHEVIKS IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN 
IT ALL BEGAN ON AUGUST FIFTEENTH WHEN LOCKHART RECEIVED SOME VISITORS AT HIS APARTMENT 
THEY WERE LETTISH RIFLES SOLDIERS FROM LATVIA 
WHO ACTED AS THE BOLSHEVIKS' PRAETORIAN GUARD 
THEY HINTED TO LOCKHART THAT THEY MIGHT BE WILLING TO BETRAY THEIR SOVIET MASTERS 
IN ESSENCE THE PLAN WAS THAT THE LETTS WOULD COME ON BOARD IN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS 
IN TERMS OF DEFECTING AND THROWING IN THEIR LOT WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION 
WHICH WOULD SEIZE POWER IN THE KREMLIN 
THE KEY BOLSHEVIK LEADERS APPARENTLY WERE TO BE ARRESTED AND PARADED THROUGH THE STREETS 
ALL THE INDICATIONS TO ME SHOWED THAT LOCKHART WAS ONLY VAGUELY INTERESTED IN THIS 
THE PLOT WAS PUT IN THE HANDS OF SIDNEY REILLY 
REILLY WAS FAMOUSLY THE INSPIRATION FOR JAMES BOND 
AND HE MAY ALSO HAVE INSPIRED MOURA 
LITTLE DID THE BRITISH AGENTS KNOW THAT THE CHEKA HAD SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN AUNT MOURA BUT IF IT WAS SHE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ACTING ALONE 
SOME OF THE LETTS WERE IN FACT CHEKA AGENTS 
THE CHEKA WAITED FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT TO ARREST EVERYONE 
IT CAME ON AUGUST THIRTIETH NINETEEN EIGHTEEN WHEN SOMEONE TRIED TO ASSASSINATE LENIN 
THE UNSUCCESSFUL ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON LENIN 
WAS SEEN BY THE CHEKA AS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO STRING TWO OR THREE UNRELATED INCIDENTS TOGETHER 
AND TO REPRESENT THEM AS ONE ATTACK ON THE SOVIET REGIME 
THE SOVIET SECRET POLICE NOW MOVED TO ARREST MOURA AND LOCKHART 
AT THREE THIRTY A M. I WAS AWAKENED BY A ROUGH VOICE ORDERING ME 
TO GET UP AT ONCE AS I OPENED MY EYES 
I LOOKED UP INTO THE STEELY BARREL OF A REVOLVER 
I ASKED HIM WHAT THIS OUTRAGE MEANT 
NO QUESTIONS HE ANSWERED GRUFFLY GET DRESSED AT ONCE 
MOURA'S LOVER WAS DRAGGED OFF TO PRISON 
REILLY HAD ESCAPED LEAVING LOCKHART TO TAKE THE BLAME 
MOURA WAS ALSO ARRESTED AND INTERROGATED 
BY THE CHEKA'S SECOND IN COMMAND A MAN NAMED YAKOV PETERS 
ER 
IT WAS MOURA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH PETERS 
THAT FIRST AROUSED SUSPICIONS THAT SHE WAS A SOVIET AGENT 
IF ONE CHOOSES TO BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS IN LEAGUE WITH PETERS 
AND WAS EITHER BEING USED BY PETERS 
OR VICE VERSA THEN THE SCENARIO THAT SHE WAS FORMALLY ARRESTED BECOMES QUESTIONABLE 
SHE COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO TRY AND TEASE INFORMATION FROM LOCKHART 
BRUCE LOCKHART HERE'S A MAN WHO'S ACCUSED OF MASTERMINDING A PLOT TO KILL LENIN 
IT DOESN'T GET ANY WORSE THAN THAT IN REVOLUTIONARY RUSSIA 
THAT'S LIKE TRYING TO KILL THE KING 
AND YET MOURA HAS ACCESS TO HIM 
IN PRISON 
AND TAKES IN LITTLE PRESENTS AND BOOKS NOW 
THAT STRIKES ME AS EXTREMELY ODD 
AUNT MOURA WASN'T MERELY RELEASED 
PETERS BROUGHT HER ALONG WHEN HE INTERROGATED LOCKHART 
I THINK PETERS RATHER SEES MOURA AS A TOOL 
AS SOMEBODY WHO CAN MAYBE SET LOCKHART OFF IN A SENSE 
PARTICULARLY IF LOCKHART THINKS THAT THERE'S SOME POSSIBLE THREAT TO HER 
IF HE DOESN'T ACTUALLY COOPERATE 
MOURA CERTAINLY HAD THE RIGHT SKILLS TO BE AN AGENT 
BUT WHOSE AGENT WAS SHE 
MOURA WAS STANDING BEHIND PETERS AND IN FRONT OF ME 
SHE WAS FIDDLING WITH MY BOOKS 
SHE CAUGHT MY EYES 
HELD UP A NOTE 
AND SLIPPED IT INTO A BOOK I WAS TERRIFIED 
MOURA AND I HAD HARDLY EXCHANGED A WORD BUT ALREADY I FELT A NEW HOPE 
AS SOON AS THEY'D GONE I RUSHED TO THE BOOK AND TOOK OUT THE NOTE 
IT WAS VERY SHORT SIX WORDS ONLY 
SAY NOTHING ALL WILL BE WELL 
MOURA HAD INSIDE INFORMATION FROM SOMEWHERE 
SOON THE BRITISH NEGOTIATED LOCKHART'S RELEASE 
SO THAT'S WHAT I KNOW OF AUNT MOURA'S REVOLUTIONARY ADVENTURE 
COLONEL PRELIN HAS UNEARTHED SOME INFORMATION AT THE K. G. B. ARCHIVE 
SO WE'VE ARRANGED ANOTHER RENDEZVOUS 
WAS MOURA JUST LOCKHART'S LOVER 
OR WAS SHE BY THIS TIME A BRITISH OR SOVIET SECRET AGENT 
SO THERE IS NO RECORD THAT AUNT MOURA WAS A CHEKA AGENT 
BUT I CAN'T HELP THINKING WOULD THE CHEKA REALLY HAVE LET HER GO 
WITHOUT GETTING SOMETHING IN RETURN 
IT WOULD STRIKE ME THAT VERY EARLY ON SHE WAS COMPROMISED 
AND NOT IN SOME 
BECAUSE SHE WAS A TERRRIBLE PERSON BUT BECAUSE THAT'S EVENTS 
WHATEVER THE TRUTH THE POTENTIAL FOR A GREAT SPY STORY WAS HARD TO MISS 
IT HAD ALL THE INGREDIENTS OF A HOLLYWOOD CLASSIC 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR THE LOCKHART PLOT CAUGHT THE IMAGINATION OF MICHAEL CURTIZ 
WHO ALSO DIRECTED CASABLANCA 
SO WHAT WOULD A FILM CRITIC MAKE OF BRITISH AGENT NOWADAYS 
MICHAEL CURTIZ WAS A GREAT DIRECTOR 
HE WAS VERY INTERESTED IN CHARACTERS 
WHO WERE IN THE EYE OF A POLITICAL STORM 
THINK OF HIS GREAT FILM CASABLANCA 
THINK OF RICK'S BAR IT'S IN THE EYE OF A POLITICAL STORM 
I'M SORRY I INTERRUPTED YOU WHILE YOU WERE GOING THROUGH MY PAPERS 
THE MOURA OF THE MOVIE IS A MANIPULATIVE SOVIET AGENT 
WHO DOUBLE CROSSES LOCKHART 
BUT AS IT'S HOLLYWOOD IN THE END THEY RIDE OFF INTO THE SUNSET TOGETHER 
I UNDERSTAND YOUR PATRIOTISM MAKING YOU A SPY 
SHE IS VERY MUCH THE KIND OF WOMAN WARRIOR THAT YOU SEE IN MAINSTREAM CINEMA 
WOMEN WHO ARE FIGHTERS WOMEN WHO BELIEVE IN IDEOLOGY IN CINEMA 
THEY HAVE THE BLACK MAC THEY OFTEN PULL OUT A GUN A LADY GUN 
LOOK AT THE MELANCHOLY IN THOSE EYES AND THE LIPS 
YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO SEE THE PERSON IT WAS BASED ON MEET THEM AT A DINNER PARTY OR A BALL SOMEWHERE 
SO PEOPLE WOULD THEN HAVE WALKED AWAY AND SAID ELENA OR MOURA BUDBERG SHE'S A K. G. B. AGENT 
OR WAS A K. G. B. AGENT YES PEOPLE WOULD HAVE WALKED AWAY AND THOUGHT 
DEFINITELY THEY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT YES 
LENIN WASN'T HERE WHAT DID YOU SAY 
IT WOULD'VE BEEN A DISASTER TO SAY WE'VE GOT THIS TOP AGENT AND THERE'S A FILM ABOUT HER 
ABSOLUTELY I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THE SOVIETS WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
MOURA MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN AN AGENT BUT SHE HAD SPENT TIME IN THE COMPANY PF SPIES 
IT WAS GUILT BY ASSOCIATION AND FROM THEN ON SHE WOULD ALWAYS REMAIN A SUSPECT 
WHEN LOCKHART LEFT RUSSIA IN LATE NINETEEN EIGHTEEN MOURA WAS JUST TWENTY SIX YEARS OLD 
AS AN ARISTOCRAT WHO'D SPENT TIME IN A SOVIET PRISON SHE NEEDED A NEW PROTECTOR IN ORDER TO SURVIVE 
SHE SOON MET A MAN WHO FITTED THE BILL 
MAXIM GORKY WAS THE LITERARY MOUTHPIECE OF THE REVOLUTION 
HE WAS CLOSE TO LENIN 
AND HIS WRITINGS HAD MADE HIM A NATIONAL HERO 
GORKY LIKED AUNT MOURA AND AS SHE WAS IN TROUBLE HE TOOK HER TO LIVE IN HIS FLAT 
ONCE A PART OF HIGH SOCIETY MOURA BLENDED SEAMLESSLY INTO GORKY'S BOHEMIAN WORLD 
THEY WERE BOTH MARRIED BUT THEY SOON BECAME LOVERS 
MY MOTHER ALWAYS USED TO SAY THAT SHE WAS PASSIONATELY IN LOVE 
WITH LOCKHART BUT THE PERSON SHE REALLY LOVED MORE DEEPLY AND HAD MORE 
PROPER COMPANIONSHIP WAS WITH GORKY 
GORKY BELIEVED IN COMMUNISM BUT CAME TO OPPOSE ITS VIOLENT METHODS 
HIS RELATIONS WITH THE BOLSHEVIKS GOT WORSE AND WORSE 
AS GORKY'S CRITICISM OF THE TERROR INTENSIFIED LENIN POLITELY INVITED HIM TO GO INTO EXILE 
THIS PUT MOURA IN A DIFFICULT POSITION 
WITH GORKY GONE WHO WOULD PROTECT HER 
SHE FEARED FOR HER LIFE SO ONE NIGHT SHE TRIED TO CROSS THE BORDER TO ESTONIA 
SHE DIDN'T MAKE IT 
THE BORDER GUARDS PICKED HER UP AND THREW HER IN PRISON 
WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT PRISON WAS THAT SHE LIKED PRISON IT WAS A VERY GOOD EDUCATION FOR HER 
SHE WAS A VERY SPOILT PERSON IN THE REVOLUTION 
THE ONLY COMPANION I HAD THERE WAS A RAT 
AND I NEVER KNEW THAT THE RATS COULD SING 
THIS RAT WOULD COME OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 
AND IN A SQUEAKY LITTLE VOICE WHISTLE 
IT WAS QUITE PLEASANT COMPANY 
GORKY BEGGED THE BOLSHEVIKS TO LET AUNT MOURA GO 
AND SHE WAS ALLOWED TO LEAVE FOR ESTONIA 
BUT THERE WERE SOME THINGS THE WRITER COULDN'T DO FOR HER 
BY NINETEEN TWENTY ONE HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN MURDERED AND THE ESTONIANS WOULDN'T GIVE HER A PASSPORT 
TO GET ONE SHE NEEDED TO REMARRY 
SHE CHOSE A YOUNG BARON NAMED BUDBERG 
HE WAS SOME POVERTY STRICKEN BALTIC BARON 
WHO ACCORDING TO HER DRANK TOO MUCH AND GAMBLED 
BUT HE WAS A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN IN SPITE OF ALL THIS APPARENTLY 
AND SO SHE MARRIED HIM 
ONCE MOURA HAD HER TRAVEL DOCUMENTS 
SHE HAD NO FURTHER USE FOR BARON BUDBERG 
WHAT WAS YOUR SECOND HUSBAND LIKE 
OH HE WAS A VERY NICE YOUNG MAN BUT HE 
WAS A TERRIBLE GAMBLER AND AT THAT TIME I COULD HARDLY ALLOW MYSELF 
THE LUXURY OF HAVING A GAMBLING HUSBAND 
WHAT DID YOU DO ABOUT IT 
AND I BOUGHT HIM A ONE WAY TICKET FOR BRAZIL 
AUNT MOURA WAS SON BACK WITH HER BELOVED GORKY IN EUROPE 
SHE MADE A LIVING AS HIS LITERARY AGENT 
HER WORK TOOK HER TO ENGLAND WHERE SHE SPENT MORE AND MORE TIME 
WITH SOMEONE GORKY HAD INTRODUCED HER TO MANY YEARS BEFORE 
H. G. WELLS 
I REMEMBER MY MOTHER ONCE ASKING HER WHY SHE THOUGHT H. G. WELLS 
HAS THIS INCREDIBLE SUCCESS WITH WOMEN 
SHE WAS ABOUT FIVE TWO AND HAD A VERY HIGH SQUEAKY VOICE 
AND MOURA SAID H. M. M. DARRRLING 
IT'S BECAUSE HIS BREATH SMELLS OF HONEY 
H. G. HAD RATHER A THING ABOUT INTELLIGENT WOMEN 
PARTICULARLY IF THEY WERE GOOD LOOKING AS WELL 
HE LIKED SOMEBODY WHO COULD ARGUE WITH HIM 
AND HE VERY NEARLY MARRIED HER 
SHE WAS NOW THE LOVER OF NOT ONE BUT TWO FAMOUS WRITERS 
AND THEY WEREN'T THE ONLY MEN INTERESTED IN HER 
HER REGULAR TRIPS TO BRITAIN HAD AROUSED THE SUSPICION OF BRITISH INTELLIGENCE 
MOURA TOLD H. G. WELLS THAT IF SHE RETURNED TO RUSSIA HER LIFE WOULD BE IN DANGER 
BUT HE FOUND OUT SHE'D BEEN LYING 
HE DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS GOING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS TO RUSSIA 
WITHOUT TELLING HIM 
WHICH DIDN'T GO DOWN TOO WELL WHICH HE LEARNED UM 
WHEN HE WENT TO RUSSIA 
SOMEBODY SAID OH YOUR FRIEND MOURA WAS HERE THE OTHER DAY 
OH THAT WASN'T THAT WASN'T WHAT H. G. HAD EXPECTED AT ALL 
AND HE WAS ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED 
WHY WAS MOURA KEEPING HER RUSSIAN TRIPS SO SECRET 
IN THE LIGHT OF HER PAST THERE WAS AN OBVIOUS CONCLUSION TO DRAW 
BY NINETEEN THIRTY THREE GORKY AND THE BOLSHEVIKS HAD RESOLVED THEIR DIFFERENCES 
HE AGREED TO GO BACK TO RUSSIA BUT HE KNEW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF STALIN GOT HOLD OF HIS PAPERS 
AUNT MOURA PROMISED NOT TO LET THE ARCHIVE FALL INTO THE HANDS OF STALIN'S SECRET POLICE 
BUT SOME CLAIM THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE DID 
I FIRST READ THE ALLEGATION IN A BOOK BY A RUSSIAN EMIGRE 
CALLED NINA BERBEROVA 
ONCE MOURA WAS DEAD BERBEROVA PUBLISHED HER SENSATIONAL ACCUSATION 
IF MY AUNT HAD GIVEN STALIN THE ARCHIVE HE WOULD HAVE USED IT AS EVIDENCE AGAINST HIS ENEMIES 
SOME OF WHOM WOULD HAVE BEEN EXECUTED 
IF THE ARCHIVE IS IN RUSSIA 
IT IS MOST LIKELY TO BE AT THE GORKY INSTITUTE IN MOSCOW 
BUT IT'S NOT 
SO IF THE ARCHIVE'S NOT AT THE GORKY INSTITUTE 
DID THE K. G. B. KEEP HOLD OF IT 
TIME TO CALL MY SOURCE 
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD MOURA NEVER BROUGHT THE ARCHIVE TO RUSSIA 
BUT THERE'S STILL ONE EVEN MORE SINISTER CHARGE AGAINST HER 
THAT AUNT MOURA ASSASSINATED GORKY 
COLONEL PRELIN HAS ARRANGED FOR US TO MEET THE MAN WHO FIRST PUBLISHED THIS CLAIM 
A FORMER K. G. B. AGENT CALLED LEONID KOLOSOV 
KOLOSOV WAS FRIENDS WITH ONE OF GORKY'S FORMER SECRETARIES 
WHO HAD DEEP SUSPICIONS ABOUT AUNT MOURA 
PRELIN SAT IN TO MAKE SURE I KEPT MY COOL 
THE SECRETARY TOLD KOLOSOV HE BELIEVED THAT AUNT MOURA HAD POISONED GORKY ON STALIN'S ORDERS 
KOLOSOV ASKS HIS WIFE TO READ ME THE STORY 
IT'S A HORRIFIC ACCUSATION 
BUT WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE 
I RETURNED TO THE ALLEGED SCENE OF THE CRIME 
GORKY'S FLAT IN RYABUSHINSKY MANSION 
THE SECRETARY'S STORY CARRIES LITTLE WEIGHT HERE 
THERE'S A SIMPLE EXPLANATION FOR WHY KOLOSOV GOT HIS FACTS WRONG 
COLONEL PRELIN HAS SAT SILENTLY THROUGH THE WHOLE INTERVIEW 
BUT HE CAN'T KEEP QUIET ANY LONGER 
IF YOU MIX TOGETHER COLD WAR ESPIONAGE SOME ACTIVE IMAGINATIONS 
AND A WOMAN WHO LIKED TO ENHANCE HER REPUTATION 
YOU HAVE AUNT MOURA'S STORY 
NO ONE LOOKS FOR THE FACTS AND AUNT MOURA AS USUAL ADDS TO THE GOSSIP 
I'M HAVING MY LAST MEETING WITH COLONEL PRELIN 
HE HAS FINALLY RECEIVED SOME DOCUMENTS FROM THE SECRET SERVICE ARCHIVE 
THIS IS WHAT MY WHOLE MISSION HAS BEEN ABOUT 
FINALLY SOME PHYSICAL EVIDENCE 
ACCORDING TO THE MATERIAL THERE'S NO BLOOD ON AUNT MOURA'S HANDS 
BUT NEITHER ARE THEY CLEAN 
GENRIKH YAGODA WAS ONE OF STALIN'S SECRET POLICE CHIEFS 
THE DOCUMENTS INDICATE THAT MOURA WAS IN CONTACT WITH HIM 
UNTIL THE MID NINETEEN THIRTIES 
IT SEEMS THAT TO BE CLOSE TO HER BELOVED GORKY 
MOURA HAD TO OFFER SOMETHING IN RETURN 
SO AUNT MOURA WAS A K. G. B. INFORMER BUT SHE WASN'T A MURDERER 
HER REGULAR TRIPS TO RUSSIA STOPPED AFTER GORKY'S DEATH 
AND IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT CONTACT SHE HAD WITH THE K. G. B. AFTER THAT 
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY HER CONNECTIONS THAT MADE HER A VALUABLE ASSET 
SHE WAS THE SORT OF WOMAN THAT WOULD HAVE DINNER WITH CHURCHILL 
YOU KNOW LORD BOOTHBY THESE SORT OF PEOPLE 
A LOT OF DRINKING WENT ON CONVERSATIONS WENT ROUND THE TABLE 
WE MAY NEVER KNOW EXACTLY WHAT INFORMATION AUNT MOURA PASSED 
OR INDEED WHAT OTHER ESPIONAGE ROLES SHE MAY HAVE FULFILLED 
THERE ARE VARIOUS DIFFERENT KINDS OF AGENTS 
YOU WILL HAVE A COURIER THE SECOND IS THE TALENT SPOTTER 
THEN FINALLY THERE WAS THE ROLE OF THE GOOD OLD AGENT OF INFLUENCE 
WHICH OF THOSE DO YOU THINK MOURA WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL SUITED FOR 
I REGRET TO TELL YOU THAT MOURA QUALIFIES 
ON PRACTICALLY EVERY COUNT 
BEFORE YOU START THINKING AUNT MOURA'S ALLEGIANCES 
LAY WITH THE SOVIET UNION LISTEN TO HER NEXT ADVENTURE 
BECAUSE IN FACT BRITISH INTELLIGENCE ENDED UP USING HER TOO 
AUNT MOURA GOT BACK TO ENGLAND IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX AND RELAUNCHED HERSELF 
ONTO THE LONDON SCENE 
BRITISH INTELLIGENCE THOUGH REMAINED AS SUSPICIOUS AS EVER 
I THINK ANYBODY WITH MOURA'S BACKGROUND 
MISTRESS OF GORKY IMPRISONED IN RUSSIAN IN THE REVOLUTION 
BRUCE LOCKHART 
I SHOULD BE AS SURPRISED TO THINK THAT M. I FIVE DIDN'T HAVE A FILE ON HER 
AS I SHOULD BE SURPRISED TO THINK THAT SHE WAS A SPY 
I THINK THAT HER HISTORY AND HER REPUTATION AS A FEMME FATALE 
MADE HER LOOK VERY SORT OF TASTY 
IT WAS VERY MUCH TO DO WITH THE THE STORY SHE TOLD ABOUT HERSELF 
AND THE WAY SHE PROJECTED HERSELF 
THE WORLD WAR CAME AND WENT 
STILL HER MAJESTY'S AGENTS ALWAYS FOUND TIME TO KEEP AN EYE ON AUNT MOURA 
I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD ARRANGE FOR OBSERVATION 
ON COUNTESS MOURA BUDBERG 
HER DESCRIPTION IS AS FOLLOWS 
AGE FIFTY EIGHT MEDIUM HEIGHT ROTUND PLEASANT HOMELY EXPRESSION 
BUT PROBABLY SLOW IN MOVEMENT ON ACCOUNT OF HER AMPLITUDE 
THE WATCHER SERVICE KEPT HER UNDER PHYSICAL SURVEILLANCE 
THE FILES HAVE SOME OF THE WATCHER REPORTS SURVIVING 
OF HER LEAVING THE HOUSE AT A PARTICULAR TIME 
GETTING A CAB GOING TO PARTICULAR OFFICES 
AFTER SHOPPING IN THE SOUTH KENSINGTON DISTRICT 
SHE RETURNED HOME AT THREE P. M. 
WHILST ON THIS SHOPPING EXPEDITION 
SHE APPEARED TO BE VERY SUSPICIOUS OF BEING FOLLOWED 
AND IT WAS THEREFORE DEEMED ADVISABLE TO LIFT THE OBSERVATION 
THERE WAS MOBILE SURVEILLANCE 
BASED FROM CARS PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO FOLLOW THE CABS THAT SHE TOOK 
THE BARONESS LEFT AGAIN AT ONE THIRTY P. M. BY TAXI BUT WAS LOST TO OBSERVATION IN THE TRAFFIC 
AT HYDE PARK CORNER 
DURING THE TIME WATCH HAS BEEN MAINTAINED SHE HAS BEEN SEEN TO LUNCH AT FIRST CLASS ESTABLISHMENTS 
AND MIX WITH LEADERS OF SOCIETY 
BRITISH INTELLIGENCE WERE EVEN MORE INTERESTED 
IN WHO WAS COMING TO SEE AUNT MOURA 
BACK THEN SHE WAS ONE OF LONDON'S GREAT HOSTESSES 
AT SIX O'CLOCK 
PEOPLE WOULD COME FOR DRINKS WHICH WAS VODKA AND CHEESELETS 
MWAH AND HOW ARE YOU 
SHE JUST LOVED PEOPLE SHE LIKED TO BE SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE 
LITTLE DID AUNT MOURA'S GUESTS KNOW 
THAT THE SECURITY SERVICES WERE LISTENING TO THEM THROUGH HER TELEPHONE 
SOMETHING CALLED SPECIAL FACILITIES ARE INSERTED 
WHICH IS ACTUALLY A WASHER THAT GOES IN TO THE CRADLE OF THE INSTRUMENT 
THAT WILL PROVIDE ACCESS TO CONVERSATIONS THAT TAKE PLACE IN THE ROOM 
SO IF YOU LIKE IT'S A PRIMITIVE BUGGING DEVICE 
AND IF THEY'D BEEN A BIT MORE ON THE BALL M. I FIVE WOULD HAVE REALISED 
THAT ONE OF HER REGULAR GUESTS REALLY WAS A NOTORIOUS SOVIET SPY HIS NAME WAS BURGESS 
GUY BURGESS WAS PART OF THE INFAMOUS CAMBRIDGE SPY RING 
THAT PASSED THOUSANDS OF TOP SECRET DOCUMENTS TO THE K. G. B. 
IN THE FORTIES AND FIFTIES 
HE'D BEEN AN AGENT RUNNER 
IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE AND NINETEEN FORTY 
AND HE'D BEEN CONSIDERED A PRETTY VALUABLE SOURCE 
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT AUNT MOURA'S FILE OUR SPIES SEEMED MUCH MORE SUSPICIOUS OF HER 
THAN THEY WERE OF BURGESS 
IT'S A WONDERFUL LINE ISN'T IT 
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT BURGESS WAS IN ANY WAY INDISCREET I MEAN IT'S EXTRAORDINARY 
BUT I'M INCLINED TO THINK BUDBERG IS NOT A DESIRABLE ACQUAINTANCE FOR SOMEONE OF HIS CHARACTER 
THAT'S FANTASTIC 
THAT HE NOTABLY EXCEEDED THE STANDARD OF CONVIVIALITY AT SUCH AN OCCASION 
BUT OF COURSE YOU KNOW BURGESS WAS FAMOUS 
FOR GETTING INCREDIBLY DRUNK AT PARTIES AND FALLING OVER EVEN THEN 
EVERYTHING CHANGED IN LATE MAY NINETEEN FIFTY ONE 
BURGESS DISAPPEARED 
ALONG WITH ANOTHER CAMBRIDGE SPY DONALD MACLEAN 
THE SECRET INTELLIGENCE SERVICE FUMBLED AROUND FOR LEADS 
WHEN GUY BURGESS 
AND DONALD MACLEAN DISAPPEARED THE SECURITY SERVICES THOUGHT MOURA WAS 
A SUSPICIOUS CONTACT OF THEIRS DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN OBVIOUS PERSON TO SEE 
I DO REMEMBER WHEN THEY DEFECTED THAT EVERYBODY WHO'D KNOWN THEM WAS TAILED BY THE FOREIGN OFFICE 
M. I. FIVE'S SURVEILLANCE OF MOURA GOT THEM NOWHERE 
SO THEY TRIED ANOTHER APPROACH 
THEY SENT IN AN ASSET 
CODENAME U. THIRTY FIVE 
WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS YOU PUT IN AN AGENT 
AND U. THIRTY FIVE WAS A SOURCE 
WHO HAD BEEN RUN SINCE ABOUT NINETEEN THIRTY TWO BY M. I FIVE 
HE WAS 
KLOP USTINOV THE FATHER OF PETER USTINOV THE ACTOR 
HE WAS OF IMMENSE VALUE TO M. I FIVE HE WAS SKILFUL HE WOULD GAIN PEOPLE'S TRUST 
AUNT MOURA WAS IN LUCK 
THE SPY M. I FIVE CHOSE TO QUESTION HER WAS AN OLD FRIEND 
DID YOU KNOW HE WAS A SPY NO 
I WAS EIGHTEEN WHEN ALL THESE THINGS HAPPENED 
I WAS PRETTY CLUELESS ABOUT EVERYTHING 
I JUST ENJOYED SEEING ALL THESE PEOPLE AND HEARING THEIR CHITCHAT 
BUT WAS HE PLEASANT ENOUGH OH VERY NO NO VERY PLEASANT 
HE WAS NICE YES AND HOW GOOD FRIENDS WAS HE WITH MOURA I THINK THEY WERE GOOD FRIENDS 
VERY GOOD FRIENDS YES HE WAS THEY WERE VERY GOOD FRIENDS YES 
OH IT WAS HIM HE WROTE ALL THIS OH MY GOODNESS HOW FUNNY 
KLOP'S INTERROGATION TOOK PLACE AT A NICE RESTAURANT 
OVER FINE WINES AND HAUTE CUISINE 
HE TRIED TO FIND OUT WHAT MOURA KNEW 
HE DID NOT ENTIRELY CONCEAL HIS CONNECTION WITH THE SECURITY SERVICE 
AND HE WOULD TELL PEOPLE THAT HE HAD FRIENDS IN M. I FIVE 
AND THAT HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIX THINGS 
HE'S OFFERING HIMSELF IN THE ROLE OF AN INTERMEDIARY 
THE NET RESULT OF OUR MEETING 
WAS MOURA'S PLEDGE THAT SHE WILL IN FUTURE REPORT TO ME 
EVERY PERSON MOVING IN HER SPHERE WHO SHE SUSPECTS OF BEING A TRAITOR TO THIS COUNTRY 
ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL 
YOU CAN SEE HER SORT OF BEING RECRUITED NOT ONLY AS AN ACCESS SOURCE IN RELATION TO THE SOVIETS 
BUT ALSO APPARENTLY WILLING TO BECOME A PAID INFORMANT 
SO THE NOTORIOUS SOVIET SPY 
BARONESS BUDBERG SEEMS TO HAVE DEFECTED AND OFFERED HER SERVICES TO THE BRITISH 
AT HER SALONS SHE'D FEED HER FRIEND U. THIRTY FIVE WITH BITS OF INFORMATION 
AND THERE'S ONE PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT COULD HAVE BEEN VERY VALUABLE INDEED 
HAD M. I FIVE TAKEN ANY NOTICE 
THE MOST STARTLING THING 
MOURA TOLD ME WAS THAT ANTHONY BLUNT TO WHOM GUY BURGESS 
WAS MOST DEVOTED 
IS A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY 
WHEN I SAID I ONLY KNOW OF HIM THAT HE LOOKS AFTER THE KING'S PICTURES 
MOURA RETORTED SUCH THINGS HAPPEN ONLY IN ENGLAND 
ANTHONY BLUNT WAS AN ART HISTORIAN WHO'D BEEN AT CAMBRIDGE 
WHO WAS RECRUITED BY RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE 
WHAT SORT OF DOCUMENTS WAS HE PASSING 
WHEN HE WAS AT M. I FIVE WELL HE SEEMS TO HAVE PASSED 
A VAST VAST NUMBER OF THINGS 
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS PRETTY MUCH WHATEVER CAME OFF HIS DESK 
ALTHOUGH BLUNT NEVER WAS A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY 
HE WAS IN FACT THE FOURTH MAN IN THE CAMBRIDGE SPY RING 
I SUPPOSE IT'S HOW YOU READ THAT DOCUMENT 
IF YOU READ IT LITERALLY SHE WAS COMPLETELY WRONG 
OR SHE'S SAYING HE'S A DANGEROUS CHARACTER 
WATCH HIM IF SHE IS REFERRING TO A PERIOD 
WHEN HE HAD A VERY STRONG IDEOLOGICAL COMMITMENT TO THE SOVIETS 
THEN THIS IS REALLY VERY INTERESTING INDEED 
THE IRONY IS THAT BRITISH INTELLIGENCE SPENT DECADES 
SUSPECTING THAT AUNT MOURA WAS AN AGENT 
AND WHEN SHE FINALLY DELIVERED THEY IGNORED HER 
THEY PROBABLY CONCLUDED THAT SHE COULDN'T BE TRUSTED 
MY ATTITUDE IS THAT SHE WAS A MEDDLER 
SHE WAS JUST SOMEBODY WHO COULDN'T RESIST PASSING ON 
A SNIPPET OF MISCHIEVOUS INFORMATION 
MY IMPRESSION IS THAT SHE DID THIS THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH HER LIFE 
SHE UNQUESTIONABLY HAD A RELATIONSHIP OVER A LONG PERIOD WITH THE N. K. V. D. 
WITH THE OLD CHEKISTS 
WHETHER OR NOT THAT MADE HER A SPY 
DEPENDS UPON WHOSE INTERESTS SHE WORKED AGAINST 
IF SHE WAS GIVING THEM INFORMATION SHE WAS A SPY AND IF SHE WAS GIVING US GOOD INFORMATION SHE WASN'T 
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING PRETTY MUCH YES 
IT'S VERY SUBJECTIVE THE BUSINESS OF ESPIONAGE 
YOU CAN BE A DIRTY SPY A FILTHY DEFECTOR 
OR YOU CAN BE A LOYAL PATRIOT 
AND A RELIABLE COLLECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE 
SHE REMINDS ME A BIT OF MATA HARI 
YOU KNOW A WOMAN ABOUT WHOM 
EXTRAORDINARY AND EXTRAVAGANT MYTHS HAVE BUILT UP 
WHO WHEN THEY SCRAPED AWAY AN AWFUL LOT OF THE BARNACLES 
THERE WASN'T A KIND OF CLUED UP SPY 
PEOPLE LIKE ATTACHING STORIES TO MYSTERIOUS WOMEN 
ESPECIALLY WOMEN YOU KNOW OTHER DIFFERENT GLAMOROUS YOU KNOW LOTS OF LOVERS 
WHY NOT 
FROM WHAT WE KNOW 
AUNT MOURA RETIRED FROM THE WORLD OF ESPIONAGE IN NINETEEN FIFTY TWO 
FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS SHE DEVOTED HER LIFE TO THE ARTS 
BECOMING AN ADVISER TO PLAYWRIGHTS AND FILM DIRECTORS 
FOR CLANDESTINE THRILLS AND SUBTERFUGE 
SHE HAD TO LOOK TO SHALL WE SAY OTHER ACTIVITIES 
SHE TOLD BRIAN DESMOND HURST WHAT ABOUT THIS TERRIBLE SHOPLIFTING 
AND BRIAN WHO HAD A BROADMINDED VIEW OF THINGS SAID DON'T WORRY ALL MY FRIENDS SHOPLIFT 
SHE SAID NO NO I'VE BEEN ARRESTED FOR SHOPLIFTING 
WHILE ON A SHOPPING TRIP MOURA POCKETED A BIT MORE THAN SHE'D PAID FOR 
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO LOOK IN MY BAG THERE IS NOTHING OF INTEREST 
THE CASE WENT TO COURT AND SHE WAS GIVEN A FINE 
THERE IS NOTHING HERE FOR YOU 
THAT WAS A SURPRISE I MUST SAY SHE TOLD US' 
THAT SHE SHOPLIFTED BECAUSE SHE NEEDED EXCITEMENT 
SHE HAD TO HAVE SOME KIND OF DANGER 
AND SHE'D BEEN SO USED TO DANGER 
THAT WHEN SHE STOPPED BEING INTERESTED IN SHOPLIFTING SHE KNEW SHE WAS GETTING OLD 
SHE SAID SOMETHING OF THAT SORT AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT 
THE TEMPTATION AFTER ALL IS VERY GREAT 
HAVE YOU EVER HAD IT I OFTEN HAVE JUST TO PICK SOMETHING UP AND SEE IF YOU GET AWAY WITH IT 
ASIDE FROM HER BRUSHES WITH THE LAW 
AUNT MOURA GREW OLD GRACEFULLY 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR SHE PACKED UP HER THINGS AND LEFT LONDON TO LIVE OUT HER DAYS IN ITALY 
SHE WAS RIDDLED WITH CANCER SHE DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY 
SHE HAD THIS SORT OF INDOMITABLE RESILIENT SPIRIT 
YOU DIDN'T COMPLAIN YOU DIDN'T MAKE A BURDEN OF YOURSELF TO YOUR FRIENDS 
AND THEN SHE DIED TWO MONTHS LATER 
MY FAMILY HAD MOURA'S BODY FLOWN BACK TO LONDON FOR A RUSSIAN FUNERAL ATTENDED BY HER LOYAL FRIENDS 
I THINK MOURA BUDBERG WAS IN THE CENTRE A RATHER GOOD PERSON 
THERE WAS SOMETHING MAGNIFICENT ABOUT HER AND SHE SHOULD BE REMEMBERED 
IN THAT WAY NOT AS THE WOMAN WHO SPIED FOR THE K. G. B. 
BUT AS THIS VERY UNIQUE VERY GRAND WOMAN WHO ER 
INFLUENCED SO MANY PEOPLE IN HER LIFE 
THAT'S HOW I'D LIKE AUNT MOURA TO BE REMEMBERED 
BUT THE MYTHS ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN MORE POTENT THAN THE REALITY 
THE STORY'S JUST TOO GOOD TO LET THE FACTS GET IN THE WAY 
WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TRUTH 
WE'D RATHER HAVE MYSTERY AND STORIES AND RUMOUR 
SHE REVELLED IN THE FACT THAT SHE WAS A BIT OF A MYSTERIOUS FIGURE 
SO IT'S VERY HARD TO SORT OF WADE INTO AND YOU KNOW PULL APART 
I'M NOT SURE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE NECESSARILY WANTED YOU TO EITHER DO YOU THINK 
SHE PROBABLY WOULDN'T WANT ME TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH BUT I SUSPECT SHE'D LIKE TO BE TALKED ABOUT 
MY VIEW NOW IS THAT FOR AUNT MOURA 
SPYING WAS REALLY ABOUT SURVIVING 
AND ABOUT SOCIALISING LET'S FACE IT 
WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO HAVE A K. G. B. AGENT TO DINNER ALTHOUGH SHE DABBLED IN ESPIONAGE 
I'VE FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT SHE BETRAYED FRIENDS GAVE AWAY NUCLEAR SECRETS 
OR SENT PEOPLE TO THEIR DEATHS 
SO TO THAT EXTENT I FEEL I'VE CLEARED HER NAME 
I COULD ALWAYS BE WRONG THOUGH 
IT'S REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE SOMEONE WASN'T A SPY 
BECAUSE THE BEST SPIES ALWAYS LEAVE THE FEWEST TRACES 
HALF COMMUNE HALF ROCK BAND 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD CHANGE THE WORLD 
EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITY TO THE GROUP 
WE LIVE TOGETHER BECAUSE WE LOVE EACH OTHER 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THESE TWO SEVERLY AUTISTIC CHILDREN 
HAD PIONEERING THERAPY TO HELP THEM SPEAK 
WHAT DO YOU WANT I WANT APPLE 
THIS POLITICIAN WASN'T TAKING ANY PRISONERS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE 
YOU EITHER BE KILLED BY THEM OR KILL THEM I WANT TO SEE THEM DEAD 
AND IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT FIFTEEN PEOPLE SPENT AN ENTIRE YEAR LIVING IN THE IRON AGE 
BREAKFAST WAS ALMOST ALWAYS A PORRIDGE OF BOILED WHEAT WITH MILK 
AND HONEY IF THERE WAS ANY 
NOW A NEW SERIES CATCHES UP WITH THE CHARACTERS 
FROM SOME OF THE BEST B. B. C. DOCUMENTARIES OF THE LAST FORTY YEARS 
AND FINDS OUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
