MARCUS' DOCTORS WANT HIM TO

STUDYING BUT AFTER SEVEN YEARS ON 
THE DRUGS HE MAKES THE DECISION TO 
STOP 
IT WAS AT THAT STAGE ONE THINK STOP HE BECAME ALMOST TOO CONFIDENT AND 
HE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE 
MEDICATION 
I WAS QUITE WORRIED MEDICATION ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE SORT OF THINGS 
HE WAS ON YOU CAN'T JUST STOP 
YOU HAVE TO BE WEANED OFF SLOWLY 
BECAUSE THEY'RE QUITE POWERFUL 
DRUGS REALLY SO HE JUST STOPPED 
TAKING IT 
AFTER JUST A FEW MONTHS WITHOUT HIS 
MEDICATION MARCUS' SYMPTOMS START 
TO RETURN HIS FAMILY HARDLY HEAR 
FROM HIM 
HE SAID HE WANTED TO GO 
OFF AND SORT HIMSELF OUT FIND WORK 
AND MAKE A NEW START THOSE ARE ALL 
VERY POSITIVE THING BUT AT THE 
SAME TIME WE WERE CONCERNED 
BECAUSE HE HADN'T BEEN PARTICULARLY 
HAPPY BEFORE HE LEFT HE WAS 
TROUBLED BY SOMETHING AGAIN WHEN WHEN HIS MUM GOES TO SEE HIM AT COLLEGE 
MARCUS TELLS HER THAT HE'S DECIDE 
TO DECIDED TO GO AWAY 
HE WAS 
QUITE CLOSED I SUPPOSE AND WE

ADDRESS ON THE BACK 
DORSET POLICE WERE ASKED TO FOLLOW 
THAT UP IN WEYMOUTH 
WHEN I WENT TO

HE WAS LIVING THERE HE HAD MOVED 
ON SO WE JUST MISSED THE CONTACT 
THE SEARCH GOES ON FOR MARCUS AND 
IT'S SIX YEARS BEFORE HIS FAMILY 
GET ANY NEWS 
THERE WERE A FEW 
SIGHTINGS OF HIM FROM SOUTHAMPTON 
WHICH CAME FROM RELIABLE SOURCES 
ONE WAS A GUY I THINK ABOUT MARK'S 
AGE WHO SAID HE'D SPENT TIME WITH 
MARK AND THAT MARK HAD CHANGED HIS 
NAME STILL MARK BUT HE CHANGED 
HIS SURNAME TO SMITH HE SAID HE'D 
KNOWN MARK FOR A PERIOD OF TIME 
BUT THAT HAD BEEN A FEW MONTHS IN 
THE PAST WHEN THE POLICE FOLLOWED 
IT UP HE'D MOVED ON 
MARCUS IS NOW 
FORTY ALTHOUGH HIS FAMILY HAS HAD NO 
CONTACT WITH HIM FOR THIRTEEN YEARS HE'S 
STILL IN THEIR THOUGHTS 
I BUY PRESENT EVERY BIRTHDAY AND CHRISTMAS FOR HIM

WAS HIS FORTIETH 
IS IT IMPORTANT FOR 
YOU TO MARK IT EVERY YEAR IT'S IT'S JUST A GESTURE EVEN THOUGH HE'S 
NOT THERE TO SEE IT 
ONE DAY YOU 
REALLY BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO BE 
ABLE TO OPEN THOSE PRESENTS 
I DO 
ABSOLUTELY 
LET'S GO BACK TO THE ABSOLUTELY TIME HE ORIGINALLY WENT MISSING 
BECAUSE YOU'D BEEN TO COLLECT HIS 
STUFF FROM COLLEGE DID YOU HAVE 
ANY INDICATION HE WAS GOING TO GO 
HE JUST TOLD ME HE WAS GOING TO 
LEAVE THE AREA AND I ASKED HIM 
WHERE HE WAS GOING HE WOULDN'T 
TELL ME HE JUST SAID I'LL RING 
YOU IN A WEEK BUT THE CALL NEVER 
CAME 
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT WAS CAME I DON'T KNOW CAN'T COME UP WITH 
ANY ANSWERS ON THAT 
I KNOW OVER 
THE YEARS YOU HAVE HAD VARIOUS 
APPEALS HAVEN'T YOU AND ON ONE OF 
THE PARTICULAR TIMES INFORMATION 
DID COME IN DIDN'T IT YES 
WAS HE YES SEEN SOMEWHERE 
HE WAS SEEN LAST 
YEAR IN WEYMOUTH IN DORSET AND 
THAT WAS A PARTICULARLY GOOD 
SIGHTING WHICH WE TRIED TO FOLLOW 
UP AND IT WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE 
POLICE OF COURSE AND THEY REALLY 
EVERYTHING DREW A BLANK 
BECAUSE YOU CAN GET SO FAR BUT 
UNTIL WE HAVE A LOCATION FOR THIS 
MAN WHO SOMEBODY THOUGHT WAS HIM I 
CAN'T TAKE IT ANY FURTHER

CHANGED HIS NAME WHAT DO YOU KNOW 
ABOUT THAT WHAT CAN YOU GUESS A A FEW YEARS AGO THERE WAS AN APPEAL 
ONE MAN RANG IN AND SAID HE KNEW 
HIM THAT HE'D MOVED TO SOUTHAMPTON 
AND CHANGED HIS NAME TO MARK SMITH 
AND IT SEEMED LIKE A REALLY GENUINE 
CALL BECAUSE THIS GUY SAID IF YOU 
FIND HIM WILL YOU GIVE HIM MY 
NUMBER AND ASK HIM TO GET IN TOUCH 
SO THAT SEEMED VERY POSITIVE AGAIN 
BUT WE DREW A BLANK TRYING TO 
FOLLOW IT UP

SAYING SHE'S SAFE BUT NOT COMING 
HOME HOME THE CALL IS TRACED TO A PAY PHONE 
AT LIVERPOOL STREET STATION IN 
LONDON LONDON POLICE EXAMINE HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF 
C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE EVENTUALLY THEY FIND 
SASHA IN THE CROWDS MAKING THAT 
CALL TO HER MUM BACK IN SCOTLAND 
INVESTIGATING OFFICERS TRAVEL TO 
LONDON TO TRY TO FIND HER 
WE'RE JUST COMING UP TO A BANK OF 
PUBLIC PAY PHONES ON OUR LEFT HAND 
SIDE WE'RE AWARE THAT SASHA MADE 
CALL FROM THESE PHONES ON FIFTEENTH 
BACK IN OCTOBER BACK HOME 
SHE THEN CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE 
STATION TOWARDS THE UNDERGROUND 
AREA AREA AT THE TIME SHE APPEARED TO BE IN 
THE COMPANY OF ANOTHER FEMALE 
SHE'S AGED IN HER TWENTIES SLIM BUILD 
APPROXIMATELY FIVE FOOT FIVE AND HAS 
DIRTY BLONDE HAIR THEY WENT INTO 
THE UNDERGROUND AREA AND CAME BACK 
OUT AGAIN STILL IN THE COMPANY OF 
THIS OTHER FEMALE THEY LAST SEEN 
HER IN THE VICINITY OF THE BURGER 
KING RESTAURANT FORTUNATELY THAT'S 
THE LAST CONFIRMED SIGHTING WE HAD 
THAT WAS FIFTEENTH OCTOBER 
NO ONE KNOWS WHO SASHA IS WITH AND 
HOW SHE'S SURVIVING IN LONDON 
SHE'S FIFTEEN 
OBVIOUSLY ANYBODY WHO IS IN 
STRANGE CITY FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE WE 
HAVE GREAT CONCERNS FOR THEM 
AS HAVE HER FAMILY BUT WE JUST 
HAVE TO KEEP VERY OPEN MIND WE 
KNOW SHE HAS FAMILY IN THE LONDON 
AREA BUT NOT IN LONDON ITSELF WE 
REALLY JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS 
AT THE MOMENT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE VERY 
CONCERNED FOR HER WELLBEING 
AFTER A NEWSPAPER APPEAL THERE'S A 
SECOND SIGHTING OF SASHA AT 
ANOTHER BUSY STATION 
THIS TIME IT'S WATERLOO 
A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC CALLED IN TO

WITNESS IS TRAVELLING THROUGH 
WATERLOO THREE WEEKS AFTER SASHA 
GOES MISSING WHEN SHE THINKS SHE 
RECOGNISES THE RUNAWAY IN THE 
CROWDS CROWDS WE'VE JUST BEEN TO SEE OUR WITNESS 
SHE'S STILL OF THE OPINION THAT THE 
GIRL SHE SAW IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE 
PICTURE IN THE ADVERT FROM MISSING 
SHE'S QUITE POSITIVE THE 
DIFFICULTY WE HAVE IS HOW WE 
CONFIRM THAT THAT IS SASHA WHAT WE 
CAN DO NOW FROM SOME INFORMATION 
SHE'S GIVEN US WE CAN HOPEFULLY 
CHECK THROUGH C. C. T. V. FOOTAGE AND 
IDENTIFY THE GIRL SHE'S POINTING TO 
US HOPEFULLY BY VIEWING THE C. C. T. V. 
FOOTAGE WE CAN CONFIRM WHETHER OR 
NOT IT IS SASHA 
THE POLICE ARE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY 
SASHA FROM THE STATION'S C. C. T. V.
