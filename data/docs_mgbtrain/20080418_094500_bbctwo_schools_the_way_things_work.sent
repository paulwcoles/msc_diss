YOU CAN WORK IT OUT IF YOU JUST LEARN ABOUT 
THE WAY THINGS WORK 
IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW IT CAN RIDE 
OR BUMP AND JUMP GLIDE AND SLIDE 
TAKE A LITTLE LOOK INSIDE THE WAY THINGS WORK 
AND WATCH THE THINGAMABOB THAT TURNS THE KNOB 
THAT MAKES THE JIGGER JIG 
THAT TURNS THE THINGAMAJIG THAT PULLS THE TRIGGER 
THAT MAKES THE DIGGER DIG 
IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW IT CAN FLY 
WITHOUT A WING OR STRING TO TIE WITH 
YOU FIND THE SAME RULES APPLY WITH 
THE WAY THINGS WORK 
IT WAS A LONG HOT SUMMER ON MAMMOTH ISLAND 
WHICH MEANT THE FISH WERE HIDING AND THE MAMMOTHS WERE SMELLING 
O. K. YOU LOT TIME TO COOL OFF 
FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO PLAY YOU'VE SPOILED OUR PICNIC 
SO THIS IS WHERE YOU TWO GOT TO 
IT'S YOUR TURN TO CLEAN THE MAMMOTHS 
NO WAY 
YOU KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THAT IS 
NICE MAMMOTHS NO BRUSHES HERE 
NO NO BRUSHES NOT AT ALL NOT ONE BEHIND MY BACK 
ARGH 
AS THE LONG HOT SUMMER PROGRESSED 
EVEN I NOTICED THE EVER INCREASING STENCH OF THE MAMMOTHS 
AND AGREED WITH OLIVE THAT IT WAS TIME TO TRY TO START GROOMING THEM 
BUT THIS WAS NOT AN EASY TASK 
IN FACT IT WAS ONE THAT WOULD NEED A LOT OF INGENUITY 
WHAT'S ALL THIS FOR 
EVERYTHING WE NEED TO BUILD A MAMMOTH DRYING MACHINE WITH TROY 
I KNOW IT'S FOR AFTER THEY'VE HAD A BATH 
A BATH OH NO 
IS IT THAT TIME OF THE YEAR AGAIN 
I'M AFRAID SO AUNTIE BRENDA 
OH WELL IF WE MUST WE MUST 
COME ON THEN LET'S MAKE A DRYING MACHINE 
IS THIS WHAT WE WANT OLIVE YES I THINK SO 
WHAT'S THIS 
IT'S GOING TO BE A FEATHER WHEEL 
I THOUGHT WE WERE WASHING THEM NOT TICKLING THEM 
ARE THEY GONNA LAUGH THEMSELVES DRY 
COR HERE GOES 
THAT'S A BIT HEAVY 
WHAT'S THIS FOR OLIVE 
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THE INVENTOR SAID IT'S AN AXLE 
WHAT'S AN AXLE LET'S FIND OUT 
FINISHED EXCELLENT WELL DONE EVERYONE 
THAT WAS THE EASY BIT HOW COME 
WE'VE STILL GOT TO WASH THE MAMMOTH 
THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO GET A MAMMOTH INTO WATER 
UNFORTUNATELY THIS WAS NOT ONE OF THEM 
THIS WASN'T GOING TO WORK EITHER 
HEAVE 
BUT ALL WAS NOT LOST 
IT WAS THEN THAT I THOUGHT OF USING A WINCH 
AND SUGGESTED IT TO OLIVE 
THE WINCH IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE 
OF HOW A WHEEL AND AN AXLE CAN BE USED TO AMPLIFY A FORCE 
THE POLES ARE USED AS ROTATING LEVERS 
TURNING THE DRUM IN THE CENTRE OR THE AXLE 
OLIVE SOON GOT THE IDEA 
THAT'S IT 
THE HANDLES GO THERE ON THE END OF THE AXLES 
WHICH ARE THE AXLES 
THE STICKY OUT BITS WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO 
READY READY 
NOW 
THERE YOU GO DAD WELL DONE OLIVE 
RIGHT YOU SMELLY OLD MAMMOTH IT'S BATH TIME 
THAT MIGHT WORK WATCH HOW THE ENDS OF THE POLES MOVE IN LARGE CIRCLES 
EACH TURN PULLS IN A SHORT LENGTH OF ROPE 
WRAPPING IT AROUND THE AXLE 
AS THE WINCH ROTATES 
THE OUTSIDE EDGE OF THE WHEEL MOVES MUCH FURTHER THAN THE AXLE INSIDE 
SO THE AXLE TURNS WITH GREATER FORCE 
IT'S THE SAME PRINCIPLE AS THE SCREWDRIVER REALLY OH RIGHT 
THE HANDLE OF THE SCREWDRIVER IS MUCH BIGGER THAN THE BLADE 
IT'S EASIER TO HOLD AND INCREASES THE FORCE THAT TURNS THE SCREW 
THE KEY OF THIS SARDINE CAN 
EXERTS A FORCE THAT PULLS OFF THE METAL SEALING 
WHILE THE FORCE OF YOUR HANDS ON A STEERING WHEEL 
PRODUCES A SUFFICIENT FORCE ON THE SHAFT IN THE MIDDLE 
TO OPERATE THE STEERING MECHANISM 
THE USE OF WATER WAS ONE OF THE FIRST WAYS OF HARNESSING POWER 
THE FORCE OF THE WATER FLOWING IN THE RIVER 
IS MAGNIFIED THROUGH THE AXLE POWERING THIS SHAFT 
WHICH THROUGH A SYSTEM OF GEARS AND COGS 
IS USED TO TURN THE STONES TO GRIND CORN 
OR AS HERE TO POWER A GENERATOR THAT IN TURN POWERS A WATER PUMP 
WHICH PUMPS WATER TO 
THESE POWER HOSES 
NOW 
AND OFF 
O. K. NOW IT'S TIME TO GET OUR DRYING MACHINE WORKING 
FINALLY I THOUGHT WE'D NEVER USE IT 
I'LL GET THE LADDER YOU GET THE HAIR CURLERS RIGHT 
THE MACHINE HAD ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE ISLANDERS 
WHICH WAS FORTUNATE BECAUSE THEIR HELP WAS NEEDED TO OPERATE IT 
RIGHT LET'S GET ON WITH IT 
I DUNNO I'M A SKILLED WORKER NOT A HAIRDRESSER'S ASSISTANT 
DON'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE WHEN IT COMES TO MAMMOTHS 
OOF TRUE ENOUGH 
IT'S VERY KIND OF YOU ALL TO HELP 
DO YOU ALL KNOW WHAT TO DO YES 
WELL DO IT THEN 
THE WEIGHT OF THE ISLANDERS ON THE BOARD TURNED THE SHAFT OR AXLE 
WHICH CAUSED THE FAN OR WHEEL TO ROTATE 
THIS WAS THE OPPOSITE EFFECT TO THE WINCH 
HERE THE MOVEMENT OF THE AXLE 
IS TURNED INTO A MUCH FASTER MOVEMENT OF THE WHEEL RIM 
IN THIS CASE THE FEATHER TIPS 
IT'S NOT WORKING 
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WIND TO DRY THE MAMMOTH 
SO I SEE 
H. M. M. WE MAY NEED A MORE POWERFUL WIND MACHINE 
LIKE THIS WINDMILL PERHAPS 
A WINDMILL WORKS RATHER LIKE A WATER MILL 
THE BIG SAILS HERE ARE BLOWN BY THE WIND 
AND ROTATE LIKE A BIG WHEEL 
THE POWER IS CARRIED THROUGH THIS AXLE TO A BRAKE WHEEL 
AND THEN THROUGH A SYSTEM OF GEARS 
TO ROTATE THESE GRIND STONES AND GRIND THE CORN 
A. A. II EE 
THE OLD WINDMILLS WERE ALL RIGHT 
BUT THEY DIDN'T PRODUCE POWER LIKE THE MODERN WIND TURBINES 
WHICH ARE USED TO CONVERT WIND POWER INTO ELECTRICITY 
THAT POWERS THINGS LIKE THIS HAIRDRYER 
IN A WIND TURBINE 
THESE HUGE BLADES ARE SHAPED LIKE WINGS 
WHICH HELPS THEM CAPTURE AS MUCH OF THE POWER OF THE WIND AS POSSIBLE 
THE BLADES TURN QUITE SLOWLY BUT THIS GEARBOX INCREASES THE SPEED 
MAKING THE ELECTRICITY GENERATOR WORK EFFICIENTLY 
BUT FOR SOME REAL POWER WHAT YOU NEED IS 
A HYDRO ELECTRIC PLANT 
THE HUGE PRESSURE OF THE WATER TRAPPED BEHIND THE DAM 
FORCES WATER DOWN THIS INLET INTO THE TURBINE 
WATER SWIRLS THROUGH THE VANES AND SPINS THIS SHAFT 
WHICH TURNS THE GENERATOR 
THE WATER WHICH HAS NOW LOST ITS ENERGY 
FLOWS OFF THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE TURBINE READY FOR FISHING AGAIN 
YES FOR REAL MAMMOTH DRYING POWER 
YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH A HYDRO ELECTRIC PLANT 
THERE HE IS BACK WITH ALL HIS MAMMOTH FRIENDS 
AND THEY'RE NOT BEING VERY NICE TO HIM WHY'S THAT 
WELL HE DOES LOOK A BIT FUNNY 
MAYBE HE SMELLS DIFFERENT PROBABLY 
HOI COME BACK 
GOOD BOY COME HERE 
STOP THAT 
AND AFTER ALL THAT HARD WORK GETTING HIM CLEAN 
GRRH DON'T GRIND YOUR TEETH PILBEAM 
WISH I HADN'T NOW FRANK IT'S GIVEN ME TOOTHACHE 
A DENTIST'S HIGH SPEED DRILL IS PROPELLED BY COMPRESSED AIR 
COMING DOWN HERE DRIVING THESE TURBINE BLADES 
USING THE PRINCIPLE OF A WHEEL AND AXLE TO DRIVE THIS DRILL BIT 
SURPRISINGLY PILBEAM'S TOOTHACHE DISAPPEARED 
BEFORE I COULD DEMONSTRATE THIS 
WELL I NEVER 
THEY'RE ALL FRIENDS AGAIN 
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE JUST LET HIM BE ALL SMELLY AND MUDDY AFTER ALL 
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS A MAMMOTH'S NATURAL STATE AFTER ALL 
AS FOR MY NATURAL STATE 
IT'S SITTING HERE WITH MY FISHING ROD WATCHING THE SUN RISE 
AND CONTEMPLATING HOW DEPENDENT WE ARE 
ON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE WHEEL AND AXLE 
A BITE AT LAST I'VE GOT A BITE 
A FISHING REEL RELIES 
UPON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE WHEEL AND AXLE AS WELL 
OH URGH OH H. 
ARGH H. 
I DECIDED TO MAKE A TIME CAPSULE BOX 
TO SHOW MY CHILDREN WHAT I WAS LIKE AS A CHILD 
THIS IS MY BOX 
AND I PUT ALL THE THINGS ALL THE THINGS THAT I LIKE 
UM THE TEACHER DONE IT 
UM OF ME I THINK IT'S QUITE GOOD 
THESE ARE ANOTHER FAVOURITE OF MINE THEY'RE DREAM DOLLS 
THAT MY MOTHER GAVE ME AT CHRISTMAS COS I USED TO HAVE BAD DREAMS 
BUT NOW I DON'T HAVE ANY BAD DREAMS COS I TELL THESE EVERY NIGHT 
WHAT DREAM I WANT TO HAVE 
THIS IS MY FAVOURITE DOLL HER NAME IS SAMMY 
SHE'S SIX YEARS OLD 
SHE GOES TO SCHOOL 
SHE'S VERY GOOD AT MATHS 
HE'S DOING A MOVE CALLED A FREEZE 
WHERE THE IDEA IS TO CROSS YOUR LEGS OVER IN THE AIR 
WHILE BALANCING ON ONE HAND 
UM IT'S A VERY HARD MOVE AND I DOUBT I'LL EVER DO IT 
A STRANGE INSTRUMENT 
IT'S CALLED A NOSE FLUTE 
AND YOU PLAY IT LIKE THIS 
AND IT'S VERY HARD TO OPERATE IT'S MY HOBBY 
HERE'S A PIECE OF MY HANDWRITING THAT I HAVE 
MY HANDWRITING'S NOT VERY GOOD I'LL JUST READ WHAT IT SAYS 
HI KIDS THIS IS ME WHEN I WAS TEN 
THIS IS MY HANDWRITING IT'S NOT THE BEST 
BUT IT'S BETTER THAN IT WAS 
I HOPE MY KIDS HAVE BETTER HANDWRITING THAN ME
