LAZARUS DIG YOURSELF 
BACK IN THAT HOLE 
LARRY MADE HIS NEST HIGH UP IN THE AUTUMN BRANCHES 
BUILT FROM NOTHING BUT HIGH HOPES AND THIN AIR 
HE COLLECTED UP SOME BABY BLASTED MOTHERS WHO TOOK THEIR CHANCES 
AND FOR A WHILE THEY LIVED QUITE HAPPILY UP THERE 
HE CAME FROM NEW YORK CITY MAN BUT HE COULDN'T TAKE THE PACE 
HE THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE DOG EAT DOG WORLD 
THEN HE WENT TO SAN FRANCISCO 
SPENT A YEAR IN OUTER SPACE 
WITH A SWEET LITTLE SAN FRANCISCAN GIRL 
I CAN HEAR MY MOTHER WAILING 
AND A WHOLE LOT OF SCRAPING OF CHAIRS 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS 
BUT THERE'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING GOING ON UPSTAIRS 
DIG YOURSELF 
LAZARUS DIG YOURSELF 
LAZARUS DIG YOURSELF

I WANT YOU TO DIG 
BACK IN THAT HOLE 
MEANWHILE LARRY MADE UP NAMES FOR THE LADIES 
LIKE MISS BOO AND MISS QUICK 
HE STOCKPILED WEAPONS AND TOOK POTSHOTS IN THE AIR 
HE FEASTED ON THEIR LOVELY BODIES LIKE A LUNATIC 
AND WRAPPED HIMSELF UP IN THEIR SOFT YELLOW HAIR 
I CAN HEAR CHANTS AND INCANTATIONS 
AND SOME GUY IS MENTIONING ME IN HIS PRAYERS 
WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS 
BUT THERE'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING GOING ON UPSTAIRS 
DIG YOURSELF 
LAZARUS DIG YOURSELF 
LAZARUS DIG YOURSELF 
LAZARUS DIG YOURSELF 
BACK IN THAT HOLE 
ANYWAY TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT 
FAME FINALLY FOUND HIM 
MIRRORS BECAME HIS TORTURERS 
CAMERAS SNAPPED HIM AT EVERY CHANCE 
THE WOMEN WENT BACK TO THEIR HOMES AND THEIR HUSBANDS 
WITH SECRET SMILES IN THE CORNERS OF THEIR MOUTHS 
HE ENDED UP LIKE SO MANY OF THEM DO 
BACK ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK CITY 
IN A SOUP QUEUE A DOPE FIEND A SLAVE 
THEN PRISON THEN THE MADHOUSE 
THEN THE GRAVE 
AH POOR LARRY 
BUT WHAT DO WE REALLY KNOW OF THE DEAD 
AND WHO ACTUALLY CARES 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS 
BUT THERE'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING GOING ON UPSTAIRS 
DIG YOURSELF
