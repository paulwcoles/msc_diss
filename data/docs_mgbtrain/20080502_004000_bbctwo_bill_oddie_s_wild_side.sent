SEA FOWL 
I'M NOT GONNA EAT YOU 
THE DANCE OF THE MARSH HARRIER WE HOPE 
CAN'T SEE ANY HARRIERS AT ALL 
IT'S RATHER WET 
AND I GET DOWN AND DAMP WITH SOUND RECORDIST CHRIS WATSON 
A 
NOW OF COURSE ALL MENUS START IN THE KITCHEN 
BUT WHOSE KITCHEN WHOSE HOUSE 
A GUITAR PLAYER 
CLAPTON KNOPFLER 
OR ER 
NO SURELY NOT 
BLIMEY 
THAT SOUNDED BETTER THAN I THOUGHT 
WELCOME TO MY MUSIC ROOM 
WHICH APPROPRIATELY ENOUGH IS PACKED WITH INSTRUMENTS ON WHICH I ATTEMPT TO MAKE MUSIC 
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT CALL IT THAT 
THE THING THAT'S OBVIOUS LOOKING AT ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS HERE 
IS THAT HUMAN BEINGS HAVE MANY MANY DIFFERENT WAYS OF MAKING DIFFERENT SOUNDS 
WELL IT'S THE SAME WITH WILDLIFE 
OF COURSE THE MOST BASIC INSTRUMENT IS THE VOICE 
AND THAT'S CAPABLE OF ALL SORTS OF THINGS FOR EXAMPLE IT CAN BE LOUD 
WILD THING YOU MAKE MY HEART SING 
IT COULD BE QUIET 
WILD THING 
OR IT CAN BE ROUGH 
WILD THING 
YOU MAKE MY HEART SING 
WHOA 
OR IT CAN BE HIGH 
WILD THING 
OR IT CAN BE REALLY LOW WHICH I FIND QUITE DIFFICULT 
WILD THING 
AND FRANKLY 
THERE ARE SOME BIRDS WHICH REALLY AREN'T AS GOOD AS THE HUMAN VOICE 
ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE OTHER BIRDS WHICH COMPLETELY 
WIPE US OFF THE STAGE 
NO DOUBT THE FIRST INSTRUMENT WAS THE DRUMS 
ONE OF THE FIRST DRUMS WOULD HAVE BEEN A HOLLOW LOG 
ANCIENT MAN WOULD HAVE GOT A PAIR OF BONES AND BEATEN THE LOG WITH THEM 
AND IN FACT THERE ARE STILL BIRDS THAT ARE USING THAT TECHNIQUE 
TO THIS VERY DAY EXCEPT THEY DON'T USE BONES THEY USE THEIR BEAK 
WHICH CAME FIRST DO YOU THINK 
THE GRASSHOPPER 
OR THIS 
CASTANETS 
A STORK CLAPPING ITS BEAK 
THAT'S A CORNCRAKE ISN'T IT 
HOW ABOUT 
GOOSE 
THERE'S TWO OF THEM 
LOOK THEY'RE MATING 
ACTUALLY THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOLDEN ORIEL 
OH YEAH 
GOTTA BE A RATTLESNAKE HASN'T IT 
BUT IS IT MUSIC 
THE MUSIC OF NATURE 
AND THAT REALLY IS MY POINT 
JUST ABOUT ALL MAN'S EFFORTS TO MAKE MUSIC WERE SURELY INSPIRED BY NATURE 
NOW FOR A NATURAL ORCHESTRA 
OR PERHAPS I SHOULD SAY A CACOPHONY YOU CAN'T BEAT A SEA BIRD COLONY 
WE COME IN PEACE 
A SEA BIRD ISLAND 
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU ARE IN THE WORLD REALLY 
THERE'S ALWAYS THE SAME MAGICAL ATMOSPHERE THE SAME INGREDIENTS 
PROFUSION AND TAMENESS 
AND IT'S AS IF THE PLACE ACTUALLY BELONGS TO THE BIRDS 
ALTHOUGH THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT PEOPLE ARE BANNED 
DAILY VISITORS 
A FEW NATURALISTS 
AND INDEED THE OCCASIONAL FILM CREW 
BUT IT WAS NOT ALWAYS SO 
IT'S REALLY NOT THAT LONG AGO 
WHEN SEA BIRDS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED 
SOMETHING TO SIMPLY LOOK AT 
THEY WERE AN INTEGRAL PART OF A WHOLE WAY OF LIFE 
INDEED A WAY OF DEATH 
FOR THOSE IN PERIL ON THE SEA 
IT REALLY ISN'T VERY SURPRISING THAT SEA BIRDS FEATURE A GREAT DEAL 
IN LOCAL FOLKLORE AND SUPERSTITION 
OFTEN IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF COLOUR 
ANY BIG BLACK BIRD WOULD BE CONSIDERED 
ALMOST INEVITABLY AS OMINOUS 
SO CORMORANTS OR SHAGS LIKE THESE WOULD BE HARBINGERS OF DOOM 
I'M SORRY LADS I KNOW IT'S NONSENSE I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T HURT A FLY 
I KNOW YOU LOOK ALL FLUFFY AND CUTE AND FRANKLY A LITTLE BIT GORMLESS 
BUT YOU JUST PICTURE THE SCENE 
IMAGINE ONE OF THESE OUT ON THE END OF A ROCK 
SILHOUETTED AGAINST A STORMY SKY 
MAYBE WITH YOUR WINGS HELD OUT LIKE A CROSS 
A FISHERMAN COMES BY NERVOUS ANYWAY LOOKS UP 
AND SEES THE BIG BLACK BIRD OF DOOM 
ON THE OTHER HAND WHITE BIRDS WERE NOT SATANIC 
BUT THEY WERE GHOSTLY 
AND WERE OFTEN CONSIDERED TO BE THE SOULS OF PEOPLE LOST AT SEA 
FOR EXAMPLE THESE RATHER SWEET LITTLE GULLS KITTIWAKES 
WITH A LITTLE MOURNFUL CRY 
THESE ARE THE SOULS OF CHILDREN LOST AT SEA 
SO DID THE FACT THAT MANY OF THESE BIRDS WERE CONSIDERED 
TO BE THE REINCARNATION OF PEOPLE'S LONG LOST RELATIVES 
PREVENT THEM FROM BEING HUNTED AND EATEN 
WELL QUITE FRANKLY THE ANSWER IS NO 
SEA BIRDS WERE A COMMODITY 
BUT MORE THAN THAT THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO THE SURVIVAL OF THE PEOPLE 
AND WHAT'S MORE 
THEY WERE EASY TO GET AT AND THERE WAS AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SUPPLY 
I'M NOT GONNA EAT YOU 
PUFFINS 
CONSIDERED EXCELLENT MEAT 
AND ALSO EXCELLENT FISH 
NO HONESTLY PUFFINS WERE DESIGNATED AS SURROGATE FISH 
SO THAT PEOPLE COULD EAT THEM ON FRIDAYS 
AND LENT 
AND INDEED ANY TIME YOU FANCIED A NIBBLE OF A PUFFIN 
SHAGS AND CORMORANTS APPARENTLY DIDN'T TASTE TOO GOOD 
BUT THEIR PULVERISED FLESH WAS APPARENTLY BRILLIANT 
FOR RELIEVING THE PAIN OF LEPROSY OR INDEED CHILDBIRTH 
OH AND ONE OTHER THING 
IF YOU MIXED UP THE BLOOD AND THE FAT OF ONE OF THESE GUYS 
IT MADE A BRILLIANT BLACK DYE FOR YOUR HAIR 
SORT OF EARLY VERSION OF GRECIAN TWO THOUSAND WHAT DO YOU RECKON 
YOU'RE SAFE DON'T WORRY LADS DON'T WORRY 
PROFUSION AND TAMENESS TAMENESS AND PROFUSION 
IT'S WHY PEOPLE EXPLOITED THEM IN THE PAST 
AND IT'S WHY PEOPLE ENJOY THEM IN THE PRESENT 
IMITATES BIRD CALL 
I DO LOVE THE SOUND OF SEA BIRDS BUT THEY DON'T HALF GO ON A BIT 
WHICH DOES MAKE ME WONDER 
IS THERE ANYWHERE IN THE BRITISH ISLES 
THAT YOU CAN EXPERIENCE TRUE PEACE AND QUIET 
THAT'S A VERY HARD QUESTION NOT HERE 
WHERE THERE'S NO CARS 
IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
BEACH BEACH MY GARDEN MOSTLY 
NORFOLK BROADS PROBABLY THE LAKE DISTRICT 
TITCHWELL THE LAKE DISTRICT 
THE CORNISH MOORS 
I WOULD LIKE THE FOREST IN EASINGTON 
PROBABLY NORTHUMBRIA DERBYSHIRE 
CHICHESTER I LIKE GOING TO THE LIBRARY MOST OF THE TIME 
PUB 
NICE PINT QUIET NO JUKE BOX NICE 
WELL HOW ABOUT HERE 
NORTHERN SCOTLAND 
WELL IT'S MOST CERTAINLY PEACEFUL 
HOW ABOUT QUIET 
I MEAN RIGHT NOW ALL I CAN HEAR 
IS THE SQUELCHING 
OF MY BOOTS 
YOU KNOW I RECKON THAT OUTSIDE OF THE DESERT 
THIS IS ABOUT AS CLOSE AS I'VE EVER BEEN TO THE SOUND OF SILENCE 
AND ANOTHER THING'S FOR CERTAIN 
THAT ROUND HERE SOMEWHERE THERE'S A MAN RECORDING IT 
I REFER OF COURSE TO CHRIS WATSON 
ACE WILDLIFE SOUND RECORDIST 
CHRIS 
I TELL YOU WHAT THIS IS LIKE IT'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE PLACES 
THEY FIND AN ANCIENT MAN LYING IN THE PEAT 
AH HERE'S ONE AND PERFECTLY PRESERVED TOO 
WELL ALMOST I IMAGINE 
YOU CAN'T HEAR ME CAN YOU 
CHRIS IS THERE SUCH A THING AS THE SOUND OF SILENCE 
THERE IS NO SILENCE IN THE NATURAL WORLD IN NATURE 
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING 
THIS PEAT BOG ABSORBS A LOT OF WATER LIKE A SPONGE 
BUT I ALSO THINK IT SOAKS UP MOST OF THE SOUND 
SOUND JUST FALLS INTO THIS AND DISAPPEARS INTO THE DEPTHS 
AND IT'S ABSORBED THERE ARE NO ECHOES 
THERE'S NO REVERBERATION NO REFLECTIONS OUT HERE 
NO ROCKS OR ANYTHING FOR SOUND TO BOUNCE OFF I SEE 
THAT'S THE CASE 
YEAH THIS IS LIKE PERFECT INSULATING SOUND INSULATING 
YOU COULD PUT THAT INSIDE A STUDIO OR SOMETHING ON THE WALLS 
I TELL YOU WHAT THE ONLY BIRD I HAVE HEARD BRIEFLY 
THERE WAS ONE SINGING AS I CAME OVER WAS A SKYLARK 
YEAH I GOT SOME LOVELY SKYLARKS 
THEY RISE UP OUT OF THIS BUT VERY QUICKLY DISAPPEAR UP HIGH 
AND I'M SURE THEY GO UP THERE BECAUSE THERE'S NO TREES 
BUT ALSO THEY NEED TO BROADCAST THEIR SONG OVER SUCH A WIDE AREA 
AND THEN IT'S HEARD 
CAN I HAVE A LISTEN YEAH YEAH 
SKYLARK'S SONG 
OH YEAH 
THAT'S FANTASTIC HOW BEAUTIFUL 
THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES YOU CAN HEAR THEM INDIVIDUALLY 
WHICH IS WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING WITH THIS SORT OF SPOTTING THEM UP 
JUST THE TWO OF US 
CHRIS YEAH 
THIS IS THE OFFICIAL LISTENING POSTURE YEAH 
IT IS FROM TODAY I'VE ADOPTED IT UP HERE YEAH 
WHY WELL I'M THE HIGHEST THING IN THIS PEAT BOG BY ABOUT SIX FEET 
SO I'M REALLY OBVIOUS 
AND SECONDLY EVERYTHING'S UP THERE SINGING 
SO THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST WAY TO DO IT 
JUST LAY BACK AND LOOK UP AND LET ALL THE SOUND JUST RAIN OUT OF THE SKY 
O. K. 
THAT'S A FAMILIAR ONE LAPWING 
ARE YOU GETTING THAT REALLY LOUD 
YEAH AND THE CREAK OF THE WINGS 
OOH 
AM I HEARING SNIPES SOMEWHERE THERE 
OH DRUMMING YES 
IT'S A KIND OF SCARY NOISE THAT ISN'T IT V. V. VVVV 
COURSE IT'S ACTUALLY MADE BY THE STIFF TAIL FEATHERS VIBRATING IN THE WIND 
V. V. VVVV EXACTLY THAT 
I MEAN IT'S NOT A CALL IT'S A MECHANICAL SOUND YEAH 
YOU KNOW I WAS THINKING ABOUT PEACE AND QUIET 
I THINK THERE'S ONE THING BETTER THAN PEACE AND QUIET 
AND THAT'S PEACE AND WONDERFUL NATURAL SOUNDS 
I DARE SAY YOU'D AGREE WITH THAT CHRIS 
CHRIS 
HE'S FALLEN ASLEEP I THINK 
AH BLESS HIM 
I'M LISTENING 
OH WHAT WAS THAT 
ACTUALLY CHRIS I HATE TO BREAK THIS TO YOU 
BUT YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY MAN IN MY WILD LIFE 
CAMERAMAN JOHN AITCHISON 
SOFT SPOKEN YET RUGGED 
AIN'T NO OTHER MAN BUT YOU 
AND INTREPID 
AND NEVER EVER FAZED BY THE CHALLENGES I SET HIM 
UNTIL PERHAPS TODAY 
JOHN I WANT YOU TO TRY AND FILM PLEASE 
THE SKY DANCING DISPLAY OF MARSH HARRIERS 
I'LL TRY IT'S NOT EASY 
MARSH HARRIER A TOTALLY APPROPRIATE NAME 
A BIRD OF PREY THAT HARRIES AS IN CHASES OVER MARSHES 
IT USED TO BE REALLY REALLY RARE 
BUT NOWADAYS THEY'RE DOING PRETTY WELL 
THEY'RE NOT DIFFICULT TO SEE BUT I JUST DON'T WANT ANY OLD SHOTS 
I WANT THIS PERFECTLY TITLED SKY DANCE 
I DON'T FEEL LIKE DANCING WHEN THE OLD JOANNA PLAYS 
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN IT 
I HAVE BUT ONLY ONCE 
DID YOU FILM IT 
YES BUT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT 
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN COS THE MALES FLY UP REALLY HIGH 
AND THEN WITHOUT WARNING THEY SUDDENLY 
PLUMMET TOWARDS THE GROUND 
AND THEN THEY SUDDENLY STOP AND PULL OUT AGAIN 
I MEAN IT'S A CHALLENGE JUST TO KEEP IT IN SHOT 
I KNOW FOR A FACT JOHN'S ABSOLUTELY ITCHING TO HAVE ANOTHER GO 
BUT ALAS I CAN ONLY ALLOW HIM ONE DAY 
THANK YOU 
NOT SURE I SHOULD THANK YOU FOR THAT REALLY 
NO I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD 
TITCHWELL 
IT'S QUITE A GOOD REED BED IT'S NOT THE BIGGEST IN THE COUNTRY 
BUT IT'S A PARTICULARLY GOOD PLACE FOR MARSH HARRIERS 
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY YET ACTUALLY BUT I'M ALL SET UP AND WELL 
GOT THE WHOLE DAY FINGERS CROSSED 
THERE'S A HARRIER 
IT'S A FEMALE 
LOVELY COLOUR 
SHE'S VERY CHOCOLATEY 
SHE'S HAVING A REAL STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS WIND 
BLOWING AROUND ALL OVER THE PLACE 
BIT LIKE A KITE 
ACTUALLY IT'S PRETTY DIFFICULT FOR ME AS WELL 
NOW SHE'S GONE UP IN THE TOP OF THE TREE 
VERY NICE SHOTS JOHN 
BUT OF COURSE IT IS ONLY THE MALE THAT DOES THE DANCING 
YEAH YOU DO REMEMBER THAT DON'T YOU 
YEAH I'M SURE HE DOES 
ANYWAY WHERE THERE'S A FEMALE THERE'S PROBABLY A MALE 
PROBABLY 
MEANWHILE WE'VE HAD ONE SKYLARK ON THE SHOW ALREADY 
WELL HERE'S ANOTHER 
I GUESS JUST ABOUT EVERYONE'S AWARE OF THE SKYLARK 
BUT DID YOU REALISE THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF BRITISH LARK 
THE FIRST IS THE SKYLARK WHICH MOST OF YOU WILL HAVE SEEN AND HEARD 
THE SECOND IS THIS ONE 
THE SHORE LARK 
THEY BREED UP IN THE ARCTIC 
BUT THEY WINTER ON SOME STRETCHES OF OUR COASTLINE 
CREEPING AROUND WITH THEIR LITTLE HUMBUG FACES 
AND WHAT ABOUT THE THIRD LARK 
WELL THIS IS THE SORT OF PLACE THAT IT LIKES TO LIVE 
SO WHAT DOES THAT MAKE IT 
A PINE TREE PLANTATION LARK 
NOPE THAT'S NOT RIGHT 
OR A MILITARY FIRING RANGE LARK 
WELL ACTUALLY IT IS FAIRLY PARTIAL TO MINISTRY OF DEFENCE LAND 
BUT THAT'S NOT ITS OFFICIAL NAME 
BUT IT'S NONE OF THOSE IT IS IN FACT CALLED A WOODLARK 
AND THAT'S NOT BECAUSE IT LIKES LIVING IN WOODS SO MUCH AS ON WOOD 
AS THIS ONE IS DEMONSTRATING EXTREMELY WELL 
IT'S A VERY PRETTY LITTLE BIRD I THINK 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT DUMPIER PLUMPER THAN A SKYLARK 
AND THAT LITTLE CAP IT'S GOT 
BEAUTIFUL BIG EYE STRIPES 
AND THAT LITTLE CAP WHICH COMES TO A POINT ON THE BACK OF THE NECK 
IT'S LIKE WHAT WAS THAT NINETEEN FIFTIES HAIRSTYLE 
THE D. A. I DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE ONE WHAT DID IT STAND FOR 
OH YES DUCK'S A. R. WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
BUT IT'S NOT THE WAY IT LOOKS THAT MAKES WOODLARK MY FAVOURITE LARK 
IT'S HOW IT SOUNDS 
IN FACT IN GENERAL IT'S NOT THAT GREAT EFFUSIVE OUTBURST 
THAT YOU GET FROM A SKYLARK 
THEY'RE MUCH CLEANER LITTLE PHRASES 
THEY TRY AND WRITE THEM DOWN IN THE BOOKS AND IT ALWAYS SOMETHING LIKE 
OOBLY OGLY OR OODLY EEDLY 
IT'S LIKE I DON'T KNOW A YODELLER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
DOESN'T DO IT JUSTICE 
ONE OF THE MOST SPINE TINGLING EXPERIENCES I EVER HAD 
WAS SOME YEARS AGO I WAS DOING A SPONSORED BIRD RACE DOWN IN DORSET 
AND I WANTED TO GET IN THE WOODS EARLY DAWN CHORUS LOTS OF BIRDS 
AND WE DROVE INTO THE CAR PARK TURNED THE ENGINE OFF 
OPENED THE DOOR 
AND IT WAS STILL DARK 
BUT THERE WAS ONE BIRD SINGING 
SKYLARK'S SONG 
IT WAS AS IF AT THAT MOMENT WITH NO VISUAL DISTRACTIONS WHATSOEVER 
IT WAS THE ONLY SOUND IN THE WORLD 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SETS 
WE HAVE INTENTIONALLY FADED TO BLACK TO CREATE THE ILLUSION OF IT BEING DARK 
BUT IF IT'S VISUAL DISTRACTIONS YOU'RE AFTER 
LET'S GET BACK TO JOHN AITCHISON 
NOW JOHN ANY JOY WITH THE SKY DANCING EH 
YEAH OH THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA SAY SOMETHING 
ER THAT'S ANOTHER FEMALE 
WHICH DOESN'T DANCE ON ITS OWN AS YOU KNOW 
STILL KEEP TRYING 
OH NO IT'S STARTED TO RAIN 
JOHN HAVE YOU ACTUALLY SEEN ANY MALES AT ALL EH 
I CAN'T SEE ANY HARRIERS AT ALL IT'S RATHER WET 
IT IS CLOSER 
WHERE I AM NOW IS CLOSER TO WHERE THE BIRDS SHOULD BE 
BUT I CAN'T SEE ANY 
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE AN IDEAL DAY TO BE HONEST 
I THINK IT'S MEANT TO BE CLEARER AND WARMER FOR THEM TO FLY 
I THINK THAT'S TRUE I THINK THAT IS TRUE 
WHO KNOWS THERE'S STILL TIME 
WELL THAT'S MY BOY ALWAYS OPTIMISTIC EH 
I DID THE USUAL TRICK WHICH IS TO HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE 
AS SOON AS YOU DO THAT THE BIRDS START APPEARING WHICH WORKED 
AND IT'S VERY WET 
HAVE A LOOK AT THIS IF I ZOOM IN 
IT'S JUST HOPELESS REALLY IT'S ALL FOGGY AND NASTY LOOKING 
WHICH IS A PITY BECAUSE THE HARRIERS ARE DOING QUITE A LOT OF FLYING 
THEY'RE NOT REALLY SKY DANCING YET 
WHICH IS THE DISPLAY THAT BILL WANTS ME TO FILM 
BUT THEY ARE FLYING AROUND NICELY AND ARE QUITE CLOSE 
WELL THIS IS MORE LIKE IT THE SUN'S COME OUT 
HOPEFULLY IT'LL CHEER UP THE HARRIERS AND THEY'LL START DANCING 
OH THIS IS GREAT 
THIS IS A MALE MARSH HARRIER 
ALMOST LIKE A DIFFERENT SPECIES ISN'T IT BLACK WING TIPS 
GREY BARS ACROSS THE SHOULDERS 
VERY DIFFERENT LOOKING BIRD AND VERY HANDSOME 
THE MALE'S JUST GONE DOWN AND GRABBED SOME NEST MATERIAL FROM THE REED BED 
HE'S FLYING ABOUT WITH A BIG PIECE OF REED 
THAT'S REALLY ENCOURAGING 
BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT THEY'RE STARTING TO DO SOMETHING 
TO DO WITH NEST MAKING AND COURTING 
AND IF WE'RE LUCKY I THINK MAYBE THE DISPLAY FLIGHTS MIGHT FOLLOW MAYBE 
WELL STRICTLY SPEAKING IT'S NOT SKY DANCING 
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE 
A PAIR DISPLAYING TOGETHER 
TUMBLING AROUND 
SHE'S CALLING TO HIM 
NAH IT'S GONE 
WELL I'VE BEEN HERE SEVEN HOURS NOW 
I THINK THE HARRIERS WON'T DISPLAY WHEN IT'S LIKE THIS 
IT'S TOO WINDY FOR THEM I THINK 
ALSO IT DOESN'T FEEL VERY SPRING LIKE AND THE THING IS THAT 
REALLY IT'S A SPRING FEELING WHEN THEY'RE DISPLAYING TO EACH OTHER 
SO I THINK IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK WHICH IS A SHAME 
WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY MORE TIME SO I CAN'T STAY ANY LONGER 
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW I SUPPOSE HOW AT THIS TIME OF YEAR AT LEAST 
THE WEATHER JUST DETERMINES MOST OF WHAT GOES ON 
IT'S BEEN GREAT TO SEE THEM THEY'RE WONDERFUL BIRDS TO WATCH 
AND IT'S GREAT TO KNOW THAT THESE MARSHES HAVE GOT THEM IN SUCH GOOD NUMBERS NOWADAYS 
BUT NO SKY DANCING 
AH BUT THAT'S THE CAMERAMAN'S MOTTO 
YOU CAN'T WIN 'EM ALL 
ANYWAY HE ONLY HAD ONE DAY AND IT WAS WINDY AND IT WAS RAINY 
AND YOU DID GET THE DISPLAY 
I THINK THAT'S PRETTY GOOD 
OF COURSE THINGS ARE A LOT EASIER FOR ME 
WHENEVER I FANCY CAPTURING A BIT OF BIRD ACTION 
WITH MY TRUSTY CAMCORDER 
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS TO GO OUT INTO THE GARDEN 
AND THERE'LL BE PLENTY OF BIRDS 
BECAUSE OF LOTS OF NATURAL FOOD 
ACTUALLY THOUGH 
MY LOCAL BIRDS NEEDN'T REALLY BOTHER TO FIND THEIR OWN FOOD 
BECAUSE I PUT OUT SO MUCH FOR THEM 
MIND YOU 
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS GO TO THOSE IT'S INTENDED FOR 
YES I MEAN YOU 
I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY TRIED TO DETER SQUIRRELS 
BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE RATHER ENTERTAINING 
TREE RATS THEY CALL THEM 
WELL I THINK THAT'S A BIT HARSH 
BUT THEN WHAT ABOUT REAL RATS 
WELL I DO HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THOSE 
I DON'T LIKE THEM NIBBLING THROUGH MY WIRING 
BUT THEY DO LOOK RATHER CUTE ON CAMERA 
ACTUALLY THE RATS VERY RARELY TOUCH THESE 
MEALWORMS NOW THEY'RE MY FAVOURITES 
FOR A START THEY'RE WILDLIFE ANYWAY 
THEY GROW INTO BEETLES IF THEY GET A CHANCE 
BUT FRANKLY THAT DOESN'T USUALLY HAPPEN 
BECAUSE THE BIRDS LOVE 'EM 
AND PARENT BIRDS ARE GRATEFUL FOR A LITTLE BIT OF HELP 
BULKING UP THEIR FAMILIES 
FOOD FOR THEM AND ENTERTAINMENT FOR ME 
YES FOLKS IT'S TIME FOR MEALWORM CHALLENGE 
HERE WE GO AND FIRST UP IS THE WREN 
JUST ONE AT A TIME BECAUSE THEY'VE ONLY GOT LITTLE BEAKS 
NEXT THE ROBIN 
ONE 
TWO 
M. M. M. IT'S NOT EASY IS IT 
O. K. THE SONG THRUSH 
NO YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO EAT THEM 
NO NO YOU JUST HOLD THEM IN YOUR BEAK 
YES I KNOW 
HASN'T GOT THE IDEA AT ALL HAS HE 
RIGHT THEN 
THE BLACKBIRDS 
NOW THE MALE IS PRETTY GOOD 
BUT DON'T TRY TO COMPETE WITH THE WIFE 
BLIMEY SHE'S BETTER THAN THE PUFFIN 
SORRY BUT YES 
NO CONTEST 
THE ABSOLUTE WINNER WITH A BEAKFUL OF 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT WELL A LOT ANYWAY 
MRS. BLACKBIRD 
NEXT TIME 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA BE LONG ENOUGH 
BACK OFF MAN I'M A SCIENTIST 
IT'S GOT WHITE EYELIDS WHEN IT BLINKS 
AND IT BLINKS AND BOBS AT THE SAME TIME 
NO NO NO NO ORDER ORDER 
CALM DOWN FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE
