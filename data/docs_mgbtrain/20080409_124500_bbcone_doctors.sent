THAT'S NOT AN OLD WIFE'S TALE YOU KNOW 
IT'S A WOMAN'S SECRET LANGUAGE 
WELL WE'RE NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT MY PERSONAL LIFE THE MESSAGE INDICATED THAT YOU SAW SOMETHING 
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU SAW 
MAISIE 
SOMETHING'S CHANGED 
DID YOU WITNESS THE ASSAULT YES OR NO 
THE BABY YOU'VE LOST I CAN'T DO THIS

HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN HOW 
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME YOU CRAZY OLD HAG 
ANNIE HICKMAN IS LYING ON A LIFE SUPPORT MACHINE YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT LOSS

NO MORE THAN I AM OF HER 
WHERE YOU FROM 
ORIGINALLY A VILLAGE NOT FAR FROM HERE

IT'S IN THE WEST INDIES 
I KNOW 
SO HAVE YOU ALWAYS LIVED HERE THEN 
JUST YOU AND YOUR MUM 
WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD WHAT WAS HE LIKE 
DID MUM SAY YOU COULD ASK ME THAT 
SHE SAID WE COULD TALK IF YOU'D RATHER NOT MUM SAID 
MUM SAYS HIS FAMILY USED TO OWN LAND AROUND HERE LOADS MORE THAN US 
THAT'S WHY THEY NEVER LET HIM MARRY HER 
BUT SHE DOESN'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT SO NEITHER DO I 
DO YOU MISS GOING TO SCHOOL 
MUM TAUGHT ME TO READ AND WRITE JUST LIKE GRANDDAD TAUGHT HER 
WE'VE GOT A WHOLE SET OF ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA DOWNSTAIRS I'M UP TO THE LETTER M. 
GO ON ASK ME SOMETHING ANYTHING YOU LIKE 
O. K. HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT LEAVING THIS PLACE 
WHY WOULD I DO THAT 
I'M JUST CURIOUS I WOULDN'T LAST FIVE MINUTES OUT THERE 
WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS A PORT WINE STAIN IT'S A COMMON CONDITION 
LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE IT AND STILL LEAD NORMAL LIVES 
OUTSIDERS WOULD NEVER ACCEPT ME THEY'RE CRUEL I'M AN OUTSIDER AREN'T I 
I KNOW YOUR MUM'S ONLY TRYING TO PROTECT YOU BUT SHE'S WRONG TO USE FEAR TO KEEP YOU AWAY FROM PEOPLE 
THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE'S DOING DON'T YOU WANT FRIENDS OF YOUR OWN AGE DON'T YOU WANT TO TRAVEL STUDY 
THERE'S A HUGE WORLD OUT THERE NO IT'S NOT CLEAN AND IT'S DANGEROUS 
LUKE MUM'S RIGHT THE ONLY WAY TO STAY HAPPY IS TO LIVE APART 
GRAN AND GRANDDAD KNEW IT UNCLE JOHN KNEW IT BUT YOUR UNCLE JOHN WASN'T HAPPY 
WHAT 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE WASN'T HAPPY 
MUM 
HE 
HE COMMITTED SUICIDE 
NO 
HE DIDN'T KILL HIMSELF HE DIED OF CANCER 
MUM TELL HER 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE 
I'M TRYING TO CALM HER DOWN 
WHAT DID YOU GO AND TELL HER ABOUT THE BABY FOR I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO DIGNIFY THAT WITH AN ANSWER 
RIGHT LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN SHALL WE LOOK I REALLY DON'T THINK 
I'VE JUST HAD A CALL FROM THE HOSPITAL ANNIE HICKMAN DIED FROM HER INJURIES 
THIS IS NO LONGER GBH IT'S MURDER DO YOU UNDERSTAND MAISIE 
WHY DID HE DO IT 
IT WAS HARD FOR US GROWING UP 
I REMEMBER ONCE JOHN WAS THRASHED JUST FOR ASKING A GIRL HE LIKED TO GO TO A DANCE 
OUR PARENTS MADE IT SO THAT WE COULD NEVER LEAVE HERE EVEN AFTER THEY'D GONE 
WHEN YOU CAME ALONG IT WAS A CHANCE TO HAVE A NEW BEGINNING 
MAKE NEW MEMORIES 
JANUARY TWENTY THIRD 
MY BIRTHDAY 
WE MARK UNCLE JOHN'S DEATH ON THE SAME DAY WHY DID HE KILL HIMSELF MUM 
HE WAS SICK HE WAS UNHAPPY 
BUT WHY THE DAY I WAS BORN PLEASE WHY I DON'T KNOW 
YOU'RE A LIAR LUKE 
YOU AND JOHN NEVER LEFT THE FARM NEVER MIXED WITH OUTSIDERS 
IT WAS JUST THE TWO OF YOU 
WASN'T IT 
DID HE FORCE YOU 
DID HE FORCE YOU NO 
I LOVED HIM HOW COULD YOU 
IT ONLY HAPPENED THE ONCE I SWEAR 
WE WERE AFRAID THAT GOD WOULD PUNISH US 
BUT THE FEELING BETWEEN US WAS SO STRONG 
THEN WHEN I FELL PREGNANT IT SEEMED LIKE A SIGN AS IF GOD HAD GIVEN US HIS BLESSING 
UNTIL YOU SAW MY FACE 
JOHN SAID IT WAS THE STAIN OF OUR SIN 
BUT I NEVER BELIEVED THAT 
YOU HID ME AWAY I WANTED TO PROTECT YOU 
YOU HID ME AWAY BECAUSE YOU WERE ASHAMED ASHAMED OF MYSELF NEVER OF YOU LUKE LUKE 
HE'S BEEN MY LIFE HE'S BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE 
I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN THIS IS YOUR FAULT 
HE HAD A RIGHT TO KNOW THE TRUTH 
WHY EVERYTHING WAS FINE UNTIL YOU CAME HERE IT WASN'T FINE GRACE AND YOU KNOW IT 
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T COME BACK 
HE CAN'T HAVE GONE FAR 
I'M SORRY ABOUT HOW I ACTED BEFORE 
WHAT I SAID WAS INEXCUSABLE YOU NEVER HAVE TO APOLOGISE TO ME HEN 
BUT WASTING POLICE TIME IS A SERIOUS MATTER WHILE I'M HERE TALKING TO YOU 
I COULD BE OUT THERE CHASING A LEAD SO I NEED TO KNOW ARE YOU GOING TO HELP ME OR NOT 
I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO HELP YOU DARLING YOU KNOW THAT 
RIGHT WELL I'M ONLY GOING TO ASK YOU THIS ONE MORE TIME

PROTECT YOU WELL IF YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING YOU DON'T NEED PROTECTING DO YOU 
IT'S NOT MY FAULT IF I CANNAE REMEMBER 
WHAT'S GOING ON I SHOULD ASK YOU THE SAME WHY DID YOU TELL HER SHE COULD STAY 
I HAD TO TO GET HER TO COME IN IT'S A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME 
I WANT HER OUT OF HERE YOU CAN'T JUST THROW HER OUT SHE COULD BE IN DANGER 
JIMMI YOU TOLD ME SHE'D BE FIT FOR INTERVIEW IT'S BAD ENOUGH HER GOING THROUGH MY PRIVATE LIFE 
LIKE IT'S HER OWN PERSONAL SOAP OPERA LET ALONE COME OUT WITH NOTHING 
YEAH I KNOW LOOK IT'S BEEN HARD ON ME TOO O. K. BUT WE CAN'T JUST GIVE UP ON HER 
SHE'S USELESS SHE'S COMPLETELY INSANE SHE JUST NEEDS HER MEDICATION 
LOOK SHE'S HAD CHANCE TO SOBER UP BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH ON ITS OWN 
LET HER STAY THE NIGHT THEN I CAN MONITOR HER SEE TO IT THAT SHE TAKES THE RIGHT COMBINATION 
SHE'S THE ONLY WITNESS YOU HAVE ARE YOU PREPARED TO THROW THAT AWAY FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW HOURS 
JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE TO GET HER STABLE AND WE CAN TRY AGAIN TOMORROW 
O. K. YEAH COURSE I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING 
NO NOT YOU I DON'T WANT YOU HERE 
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE YOU LIKE THIS 
I DON'T CARE JUST GO AWAY PLEASE 
LUKE I AM SO SORRY 
I NEVER MEANT FOR ANY OF THIS TO HAPPEN 
CURSED BE HE THAT LYETH WITH HIS SISTER THE DAUGHTER OF HIS FATHER 
THE DAUGHTER OF HIS MOTHER 
DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN VERSE TWENTY TWO 
I'M A CURSE DON'T SAY THAT 
NONE OF THIS IS YOUR FAULT 
I THOUGHT I KNEW WHO I WAS YOU'RE STILL THE SAME PERSON

SHE LOVES YOU SO MUCH 
NO YOU KNOW THAT SHE DOES SHE DISGUSTS ME 
SHE WANTED TO SLEEP WITH HIM 
HER OWN BROTHER 
LOOK I KNOW THAT SHE'S MADE SOME BIG MISTAKES 
AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE ANGRY 
BUT THINK ABOUT HER CHILDHOOD 
SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE LOVE THAT YOU DID 
DON'T BLAME HER FOR FINDING LOVE WHEREVER SHE COULD 
TELL ME WHAT TO DO 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NOW 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION RIGHT AWAY 
IF I STAY HERE I'LL JUST END UP LIKE THEM 
BUT IF I LEAVE 
I NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME OUT THERE 
WELL 
IT'S NOT ALWAYS GONNA BE EASY 
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN A WHOLE NEW WAY OF LIFE 
BUT YOU'RE BRIGHT AND YOU'RE CAPABLE 
AND I THINK YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO AT LEAST TRY

THANK GOOD GOD YOU'RE SAFE 
LUKE'S DECIDED TO HEAR YOU OUT 
I KNEW IT WAS WRONG TO LIE TO YOU 
BUT I THOUGHT IF YOU KNEW THE TRUTH ABOUT JOHN'S DEATH YOU'D CARRY IT AROUND WITH YOU YOU'D THINK 
THAT YOU WERE SOMEHOW RESPONSIBLE 
AND I WAS AFRAID I WAS AFRAID THAT IF YOU KNEW THE TRUTH ABOUT ME I'D LOSE YOU 
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE TOLD ME 
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL ABOUT YOU RIGHT NOW 
I'M SORRY
