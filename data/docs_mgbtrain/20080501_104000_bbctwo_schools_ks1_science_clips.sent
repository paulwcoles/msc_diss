ELEPHANTS REALLY LIKE TO EAT ACACIA LEAVES 
A HUNGRY ELEPHANT THAT FANCIES A SNACK WHILST WANDERING ABOUT 
CAN PUSH OVER A WHOLE TREE JUST TO GET TO THE TASTY LEAVES AT THE TOP 
HERE IN MONTANA IN AMERICA 
YOU CAN FIND REAL COWBOYS EVEN TODAY 
AND THIS WEEK WHOA 
THEY'RE ALL IN TOWN FOR THE BIGGEST SHOW AROUND IT'S RODEO WEEK 
A CHANCE FOR COWBOYS AND COWGIRLS TO SHOW OFF JUST WHAT THEY CAN DO 
THE RODEO HAPPENS EVERY YEAR AND IT STARTS WITH A PARADE THROUGH TOWN 
I JOINED COWGIRL THERESA TO SET UP ONE OF THE WAGONS 
I'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO SOME FRIENDS RAY AND ROSIE HI 
FIRST WE STRAP THE HORSES TO THE WAGON HOW MANY PUSHES AND PULLS 
PUSHING AND PULLING 
EVEN THE TOWN'S OLD FIRE ENGINE WAS PULLED BY HORSES 
ONE PLACE WITH LOTS OF PUSHING AND PULLING IS ON THE RAILWAY 
AT THE NATIONAL RAILWAY MUSEUM IN YORK 
THEY HAVE THE BEST COLLECTION OF PUSHERS AND PULLERS IN THE WORLD 
MY LORDS AND LADIES MAY I PRESENT TO YOU THE DUCHESS OF HAMILTON 
YES IN FACT THE DUCHESS IS A MAGNIFICENT STEAM LOCOMOTIVE 
AND HAS TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MUSEUM 
NOW IF THERE'S ONE BIT OF THE TRAIN 
ALL TO DO WITH PUSHING AND PULLING IT'S THIS BIT 
THE BUFFERS THESE DISKS ARE FOR PUSHING 
AND FOR PULLING YOU'VE GOT THE HOOKS AND THE CHAINS

MARK IS TESTING THE FORCE OF WATER SHALLOW WATER HAS A LOT OF FORCE 
IT'S JUST COMING UP JUST PAST MY ANKLES NOW

MARK IS A PROFESSIONAL STUNTMAN AND VERY FIT 
I'M GOING TO GO ANY SECOND I'M ACTUALLY MOVING BACK 
THE WATER IS ONLY UP TO HIS KNEES AND MARK IS STRONG 
HIGH STREETS ARE MORE DANGEROUS THAN YOU THINK 
AND CARS CAN'T STOP INSTANTLY JUST BECAUSE YOU CROSS THE ROAD 
EVEN IF THE DRIVER IS QUICK ON THE BRAKES 
THE CAR WILL STILL CONTINUE BEFORE IT STOPS 
THIS CAR HAS JUST STARTED TO BRAKE 
BUT IT ISN'T TRAVELLING ALL THAT FAST 
BUT IT WILL TAKE THE CAR SEVEN METRES TO STOP 
THAT MEANS THAT THE CAR TRAVELS FOR A FURTHER FIVE METRES 
AFTER THIS POINT 
YOU KNOW YOUR STREET 
AND EVERYONE YOU MEET 
YOU KNOW WHICH DOGS BARK 
THE BEST WAY TO THE PARK 
HAVE A LAUGH EACH DAY 
WHEN YOU KNOW YOUR WAY 
YOU KNOW THE ROAD WELL 
BUT YOU NEVER CAN TELL 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE WISE 
YOU COULD BE SURPRISED 
IT'S ON THE ROADS YOU KNOW 
STOP THINK THEN GO 
WOO OOH WOO OOH WOO OOH 
WOO OOH WOO OOH WOO OOH
