TAKE A BOW 
WELCOME TO GIGHA WE ARE HERE 
GIGHA IS A WEE ISLAND OFF THE WEST COAST OF SCOTLAND 
THERE'S ONLY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE ON THE ISLAND AND WE ARE THE CHILDREN 
GIGHA IS A GREAT PLACE WE CAN PLAY ON THE BEACH OR AT THE SEA EVERY DAY 
WE FOUND A STARFISH 
STARFISH 
IT'S A REAL LIVE STARFISH DOWN IN THE SEA 
I'VE GOT IT 
I WANT TO TOUCH IT TOUCH IT THEN JUST TOUCH IT GENTLY GENTLY 
NOW LET IT GO 
SAY BYE BYE BYE BYE 
SHALL WE TRY AND FIND A FISH NOW THAT WAS COOL 
THIS IS THE GIGHA WINDMILLS AND WE CALL THEM THE DANCING LADIES 
THEY PRODUCE ELECTRICITY 
ON GIGHA WE DON'T HAVE ANY SUPERMARKET WE ONLY HAVE ONE SHOP 
IT SELLS ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING 
I'VE LIVED ON THIS ISLAND ALL MY LIFE AND I LOVE HORSES 
WE ONLY HAVE ONE ROAD 
YOU CAN CYCLE FROM ONE END OF THE ISLAND TO THE OTHER 
HERMIT CRABS ARE CRABS THAT LIVE IN SEASHELLS 
THAT'S THE DAY WHEN I CAUGHT EIGHT MACKEREL 
AT THE SOUTH END OF THE ISLAND 
THAT'S A PICTURE OF ME AND MY DAD OUT FISHING AND PICKING UP THE CREELS 
THIS IS THE BEACH 
I LIKE COMING TO GIGHA ON MY HOLIDAYS 
A LONG TIME AGO ON GIGHA ALL THE PEOPLE USED TO SPEAK GAELIC 
BUT NOW ONLY A FEW PEOPLE SPEAK IT 
WE WILL SING YOU A GAELIC SONG
