NEWS THAT SHE HAD BEEN CHARGED

DISAPPEARANCE KAREN MATTHEWS 
APPEALED FOR HELP IN FINDING HER 
DAY AFTER DAY SHE APPEARED AS THE

NINE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER SHANNON WAS 
EVENTUALLY FOUND THREE WEEKS AGO 
IN A HOUSE A MILE FROM HER HOME 
TONIGHT HER MOTHER WAS CHARGED IN 
CONNECTION WITH HER DISAPPEARANCE 
HAVING CAREFULLY CONSIDERED ALL OF 
THE EVIDENCE PROVIDED IN THE FILE 
BY WEST YORKSHIRE POLICE WE HAVE 
DECIDED THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENT 
EVIDENCE AND HAVE AUTHORISED THAT 
KAREN MATTHEWS BE CHARGED WITH 
PERVERTING THE COURSE OF JUSTICE 
AND CHILD NEGLECT SHE IS IN THE

THE SEARCH 
FOR SHANNON MATTHEWS WAS THE 
BIGGEST IN WEST YORKSHIRE FOR THIRTY 
YEARS MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED POLICE 
OFFICERS 
THIS CLOSE FRIEND SAID SHE WOULD BE 
STANDING BY KAREN MATTHEWS 
I AM 
GOING TO REMAIN A FRIEND WHATEVER 
HAPPENS I WAS KAREN'S FRIEND 
BEFORE SIX WEEKS AGO AND I'LL 
STILL BE KAREN'S FRIEND IN SIX 
MONTHS' TIME 
AT THE CENTRE OF IT 
ALL HAS BEEN AIN NINE YEAR OLD 
SCHOOLGIRL POLICE SAY THEIR 
INVESTIGATION ISN'T OVER YET INAUDIBLE WELL I'M VERY SORRY ABOUT THAT 
MARK WAS CLEARLY WANT TO CONCLUDE 
THAT PIECE BUT WE HAD A PROBLEM ON 
THE SOUND HE WAS REPORTING THERE 
OBVIOUSLY ON TONIGHT'S LATEST 
DEVELOPMENTS WHICH IS THAT THE 
MOTHER OF SHANNON MATTHEWS HAS BEEN 
CHARGED AND WILL APPEAR BEFORE 
MAGISTRATES TOMORROW 
THERE'S BEEN A SHARP DROP IN HOUSE 
PRICES AND IT'S LED TO WARNINGS OF 
EVEN BIGGER FALLS TO COME THE TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
DROP IN MARCH REPORTED BY THE 
HALIFAX WAS THE BIGGEST IN SIXTEEN 
YEARS THE CREDIT CRUNCH IS MAKING 
IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE 
TO GET MORTGAGES GORDON BROWN TOLD 
THE B. B. C. TODAY THAT BRITAIN WAS WELL 
PLACED TO WEATHER THE STORM 
IT CAN BE HARD TO GET A BIRDS EYE 
VIEW OF THE ECONOMY BUT THE BIG 
PICTURE ON HOUSE PRICES IS FAIRLY 
CLEAR THEY'RE STARTING TO GO DOWN 
BRITAIN'S BIGGEST LENDER THE 
HALIFAX SAYS PRICES FELL TWENTY FIVE PER CENT LAST 
MONTH THE BIGGEST FALL SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO 
YOU CAN'T READ TOO MUCH INTO ONE 
MONTH'S FIGURES 
BUT ON THE SAME 
MONTH'S FIGURES BUT ON THE SAME MEASURE PRICES HAVE FALLEN ONE PER CENT 
SINCE DECEMBER THAT MEANS THE 
AVERAGE HOUSE PRICE IS ONLY ONE PER CENT 
HIGHER THAN A YEAR AGO BACK THEN 
PRICES WERE GROWING AT ELEVEN PER CENT HOUSE 
PRICES ARE STILL GOING UP IN SOME 
AREAS AND WHERE THEY'RE FALLING 
WE'RE TALKING MODEST DECLINE SO FAR 
THEY'RE NOT FALLING OFF A CLIFF 
BUT THERE HAS BEEN A DRAMATIC SHIFT 
IN THE BALANCE OF POWER A YEAR AGO 
SELLERS WERE IN CONTROL NOW THE 
BOOT IS FIRMLY ON THE OTHER FOOT 
IT'S NOW VERY MUCH A BUYERS MARKET 
THEY'RE WEARING THE TROUSERS 
CLEARLY THERE IS OPPORTUNITY FOR 
SELLERS BUT THEY NEED TO BE SELLING 
AT REALISTIC PRICES IF THEY'RE 
DIGGING THEIR HEALS HEELS IN 
THEY'RE NOT 
GOING TO SELL THE 
PROPERTY 
OF COURSE MOST PEOPLE PROPERTY AREN'T BUYING OR SELLING A HOUSE 
RIGHT NOW MANY COMING OFF FIXED 
RATE DEALS ARE LOOKING FOR A NEW 
MORTGAGE THE BALANCE HAS SHIFTED 
THERE AS WELL TIME WAS BORROWERS 
COULD PICK AND CHOOSE NOW LENDERS 
HAVE ALL THE POWER MARK AND CYNDI 
STARTED LOOKING FOR A NEW MORTGAGE 
FOR THEIR FLAT IN BRIGHTON A FEW 
WEEKS AGO THEY THOUGHT THEY'D 
FOUND A GOOD DEAL 
ONE WEEK LATER 
BECAUSE I HADN'T SIGNED UP AT THAT 
POINT MY MORTGAGE LENDER CALLED ME 
BACK TO SAY SORRY YOU CAN'T HAVE 
THAT ANY MORE IT'S NOW THIS RATE 
AND THE RATE WAS HIGHER AND THE 
ARRANGEMENT FEE WAS MORE L. SAID 
WHY HAS IT CHANGED SHE SAID 
DIFFICULT MORTGAGE MARKET AT THE 
MOMENT 
TODAY WAS THE LAST DAY MOMENT ANYONE IN BRITAIN COULD GET A 
MORTGAGE WITHOUT A DEPOSIT ABBEY'S 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT MORTGAGE GOES OFF THE MARKET 
TONIGHT EVEN IF YOU HAVE CASH FOR 
A DEPOSIT THE MARKET IS LESS 
FRIENDLY THAN IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO 
THE AVERAGE RATE ON A NEW FIXED 
RATE MORTGAGE WAS JUST UNDER 
FIVE PER CENT 
RATE MORTGAGE WAS JUST UNDER FIVE PER CENT THE LATEST FIGURES THE AVERAGE 
RATE WAS CLOSER TO SIX PER CENT 
THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE 
OUR 
THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE OUR ORIGINAL REPAYMENTS WAS JUST UNDER 
EIGHT HUNDRED IT VARIED SLIGHTLY DURING THE 
TWO YEARS BUT NOW OUR REPAYMENTS 
ARE FRACTIONALLY OVER TWELVE HUNDRED A MONTH 
BRITAIN DOESN'T LOOK LIKE AMERICA 
YET THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY 
FUND TODAY PREDICTED THE TOTAL 
LOSSES FROM THE CREDIT CRUNCH OVER 
THERE WERE GOING TO BE WELL OVER 
NINE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS THE TIDE HERE HAS 
DEFINITELY TURNED 
THE PRIME MINISTER SELLS THE SHARP 
FALL IN HOUSES PRICES HAS TO BE 
SEEN AGAINST THE BACK DROP OF A 
DECADE OF RISING VALUES HE 
PROMISED SOME HELP FOR HOME OWNERS 
STRUGGLING TO MEET THEIR REPAYMENTS 
MR. BROWN WAS SPEAKING EXCLUSIVELY 
TO OUR POLITICAL EDITOR NICK 
ROBINSON ROBINSON A VISIT FROM THE PRIME MINISTER FOR 
ONE LUCKY YOUNG HOME BUYER SHE CAN 
GET A MORTGAGE AS NURSE SHE 
BENEFITS FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S 
SHARED OWNERSHIP SCHEME THIS ON A 
DAY WHEN GORDON BROWN WANTED YOU TO 
KNOW THAT HE FOR ONE ISN'T 
PANICKING ABOUT POSSIBLE SLUMP IN 
THE HOUSING MARKET LATER IN 
DOWNING STREET I ASKED THE PRIME 
MINISTER WHETHER GIVEN THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH PEOPLE SHOULDN'T ASSUME 
THAT THINGS CAN ONLY GET WORSE 
WE'VE SEEN HOUSE PRICES RISE BY 
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY PER CENT OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS 
I THINK THEY'VE RISEN EIGHTEEN PER CENT OVER THE 
LAST THREE YEARS SO A TWENTY FIVE PER CENT FALL IS 
SOMETHING THAT IS CONTAINABLE THE 
ISSUE IS REQUEST WE CAN WE ENSURE 
GROWTH IS MAINTAINED IN THIS 
ENCONMY THAT WE CAN GET THE 
HOUSING MARKET TO CONTINUE TO MOVE 
FORWARD 
PEOPLE SEE HOUSE PRICES FORWARD FALLING MORTGAGES BEING REFUSED 
LOANS ENDING FOR SMALL BUSINESSES 
WHEN THEY FEAR IS THAT THEY'RE IN 
FOR A TRULY DREADFUL TIME 
ECONOMICALLY 
I'M ALWAYS VIGILANT ECONOMICALLY THE RECORD IS OVER THE LAST TEN 
YEARS WE'VE MAINTAINED A COURSE OF 
STABILITY ALWAYS AT VERY DIFFICULT 
TIMES 
ONLY A MONTH AGO THERE WAS A TIMES BUDGET IN WHICH THE CHANCELLOR 
LOOKED CHEERFUL YOU LOOKED 
CHEERFUL AT HIS SIDE THEY SEE WHAT 
IT HAPPEN ANYTHING THE LAST WEEK 
AND BEGIN TO WONDER WHETHER THE 
GOVERNMENT IS IN DENIAL ABOUT HOW 
BAD THIS MAY BECOME 
I THINK IT'S 
QUITE THE OPPOSITE WE ARE SHOWING 
TODAY BY THE ACTION WE'RE TAKING IN 
THE ACTION MARKET HOW OUR 
VIGILANCE AND DETERMINATION TO BE 
ON THE SIDE OF HOME BUYERS BY 
BEING TOUGH ON INFLATION TAKING 
DIFFICULT DECISIONS TO DO SO WE 
CAN KEEP INTEREST RATES LOW IN THIS 
COUNTRY THEY'VE COME DOWN ON TWO 
OCCASIONS 
CAN I ASK 
YOU ABOUT HOW OCCASIONS YOU FEEL NOW YOU'RE IN NUMBER TEN 
PEOPLE ARE SEEING LABOUR M. P.'S 
COMPLAINING ABOUT MEETINGS THAT YOU 
ADDRESS SIGNING MOTIONS DIRECTLY 
CRITICAL EVEN MINISTERS 
CRITICISING GOVERNMENT POLICY DO 
YOU FEAR YOUR PARTY'S LOST THE WILL 
TO GOVERN 
NOT AT ALL IN ANY 
GOVERNMENT YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE 
DIFFICULT AND LONG TERM DECISIONS 
NOT EVERYTHING YOU DO IS GOING TO 
BE IMMEDIATELY POPULAR BUT THESE 
DECISIONS ARE SOMETHING 
CONTROVERSIAL I THINK THE ONLY 
THING THAT MATTERS FOR THE FUTURE 
OF THIS COUNTRY IS THAT PEOPLE ARE 
PREPARED TO TAKE THE LONG TERM VIEW 
NOT SOMETHING DONE OUT OF SHORT 
TERM CONVENIENCE NOT PLAYED TO THE 
GALLERY TAKING THE RIGHT LONG TERM 
DECISIONS WHETHER IT'S ON THE 
ECONOMY OR OTHER THINGS WE WILL BE 
JUDGED IN THE LONG TERM BY WHAT WE 
ACHIEVE AND WHAT WE DO 
TONIGHT IN 
THIS HOUSE AS IN MILLIONS OF OTHERS 
THEY'RE WAITING WATCHING AND 
HOPING THAT WHAT WE'RE SEE ING IS A 
MARKET CORRECTION AND NOT SOMETHING 
MUCH MUCH WORSE 
MOHAMMED AL FAYED SAID TONIGHT HE 
WAS GIVING UP HIS TEN YEAR LEGAL 
BATTLE OTHER THE DEATHS OF PRINCESS 
DIANA AND HIS SON DODI HE SAYS HE 
ACCEPTS THE INQUEST VERDICT OF 
UNLAWFUL KILLING WITH RESERVATIONS 
HE'LL TAKE NO MORE COURT ACTION FOR 
THE SAKE OF THE PRINCESS'S TWO SONS 
HE MAINTAINS HIS BELIEF THAT THEY 
WERE THE VICTIMS A MURDER PLOT 
AS THE OLYMPIC TORCH CONTINUES ITS 
TROUBLED GLOBAL JOURNEY SENIOR 
OLYMPIC OFFICIALS ARE NOT RULING 
OUT CANCELLING THE RELAY IF THINGS 
DON'T IMPROVE THE TORCH HAS 
ARRIVED IN SAN FRANCISCO 
DEMONSTRATORS HAVE ALREADY STAGED A 
PRO TIBET PROTEST CLIMBING ON THE 
GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE WITH BANNERS 
WITH ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE DAYS UNTIL THE GAMES 
BEGINS THE I. O. C. IS MEETING IN 
BEIJING TO FINALISE PLANS 
THE BEIJING TORCH ARRIVED IN SAN 
FRANCISCO TONIGHT THE NEXT STOP ON 
ITS DISASTROUS JOURNEY ROUND THE 
WORLD THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN 
DEMONSTRATIONS ON THE GOLDEN GATE 
BRIDGE AND SHOULD THERE BE MORE 
TROUBLE TOMORROW THIS COULD BE THE 
LAST FOREIGN CITY IT VISITS PEACE 
AND HARMONY WERE MEANT TO BE THE 
WATCH WORD AT THIS GALERING 
GATHERING IN BEIJING A PAT ON THE 
BACK FOR THE CHINESE BEFORE THE 
GAMES THAT TUNE HAS DRAMATICALLY 
CHANGED TALKING TO I. O. C. MEMBERS 
HERE I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT CHINA WAS 
REPEATEDLY WARNED BY HIGH OLYMPIC 
OFFICIALS NOT TO HAVE AN 
INTERNATIONAL TORCH RELAY THE TALK 
HERE NOW IS THAT THE OLYMPIC BRAND 
HAS BEEN DAMAGED AND THERE'S A 
GROWING FEELING THAT SHOULD SAN 
FRANCISCO GO THE WAY OF PARIS OR 
LONDON BEIJING'S INTERNATIONAL 
TORCH RELAY MAY HAVE TO BE 
CURTAILED IF NOT CANCELLED A 
DECISION ON THAT MIGHT BE TAKEN 
LATE THER WEEK WHEN INTERNATIONAL 
OLYMPIC COMMITTEE PRESIDENT 
JACQUES ROGGE CHAIRS AN EXECUTIVE 
BOARD MEETING 
WE'LL DISCUSS THIS 
AND WE'LL SEE WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK 
AT AFTER THIS L. THINK NOW SIXTH OR 
THE SEVENTH LEG WE'LL SEE WHAT 
KIND OF CONCLUSIONS WE HAVE TO TAKE 
FROM THAT 
THE PROTESTS BEGAN AS 
SOON AS THE FLAME WAS LIT IN LIMBA 
OWE OLYMPIA THE BIRTHPLACE OF 
THE OLYMPICS IT INTENSIFIED 
THROUGH ITS THIRTY ONE MILE ORDEAL THROUGH 
LONDON AND THE FLAME ITSELF WAS 
EXTINGUISHED DURING ITS TROUBLED 
PASSAGE THROUGH PARIS ALL THIS HAS 
MADE EVEN GREAT OLYMPIANS QUESTION 
WHETHER THE JOURNEY IS WORTHWHILE 
HAVING SEEN WHAT I'VE SEEN AND 
WITNESSED ON SUNDAY IT WOULDN'T BE 
A BAD IDEA PEOPLE THAT ARE LINING 
THE STREETS TO SEE THE TORCH FOR 
THE RIGHT REASONS AREN'T GETTING 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO FEEL THAT 
OLYMPIC SPIRIT AND POSSIBLY NOT 
EVEN SEE THE TORCH AT ALL JACQUES JACQUES ROGGE AND THE I. O. C. MUST DECIDE HOW 
BEST TO RESTORE THE TARNISHED IMAGE 
OF THE OLYMPIC MOVEMENT 
COMING UP ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME A 
THRILLER AT ANFIELD AS LIVERPOOL 
TAKE ON ARSENAL IN TONIGHT'S 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE QUARTER FINAL 
AMERICA'S SENIOR COMMANDER IN IRAQ 
SAYS THAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE BY 
HIS FORCES BUT IT'S UNEVEN AND 
IT'S FRAGILE GENERAL DAVID 
PETRAEUS TOLD CONGRESS THAT 
SECURITY IN THE COUNTRY WAS 
SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER BUT THAT HE 
WANTED A FORTY FIVE DAY PAUSE BEFORE ANY 
MORE TROOP WITHDRAWALS WERE 
APPROVED 
THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE SURGE THE 
SURGE IS ALMOST OVER THERE ARE 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND AMERICAN TROOPS IN IRAQ AT 
THE MOMENT THAT NUMBER WILL FALL 
TO AROUND ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND BY THE SUMMER 
THE QUESTION WHAT THEN THIS MAN 
WAS IN WASHINGTON TO PROPOSE AN 
ANSWER AMERICA'S MOST 
SIR AGAIN AT THE END OF THE PERIOD 
OF CONSOLIDATION AND EVALUATION IT 
COULD BE RIGHT THEN OR IT COULD BE 
LONGER AGAIN IT IS ONE BRING BRING THEM HOME 
A PROTESTER GOT IN THE 
WAY OF A FIRM ANSWER TO THAT 
QUESTION IT LOOKS AS IF THE 
PETRAEUS PLAN IS FOR NO BIG 
REDUCTIONS MUCH BEFORE THE NOVEMBER 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THEN OF 
COURSE SOMEONE ELSE WILL BE READY 
TO TAKE CONTROL JOHN MCCAIN THE 
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 
HAS SAID AMERICA MUST FIGHT ON AND 
COULD STAY IN IRAQ FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS IF 
THAT'S WHAT IT TOOK TO GUARANTEE 
SECURITY HILLARY CLINTON SAYS 
LONG TERM COMMITMENTS WON'T WORK 
SHE WOULD ORDER WHAT SHE CALLS A 
PHASED WITHDRAWAL WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF 
TAKING OFFICE BARACK OBAMA THE 
DEMOCRATIC FRONT RUNNER AGREES ON 
THE NEED FOR PULLOUT HE SAYS HE 
WILL TAKE ALL U. S. COMBAT TROOPS OUT 
OF IRAQ WITHIN SIXTEEN MONTHS OF 
BECOMING PRESIDENT MRS. CLINTON HAD 
HER CHANCE TO QUESTION THE GENERAL 
THIS AFTERNOON SHE WAS COURTEOUS 
BUT FIRM 
THE ADMINISTRATION AND 
SUPPORTERS OF THE ADMIN STRIGS'S 
POLICY OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE COST OF 
LEAVING IRAQ YET IGNORE THE 
GREATER COSTS OF CONTINUING THE 
SAME FAILED POLICY 
ACROSS TOWN A 
MEDAL CEREMONY THE COSTS OF WAR 
MARKED BY THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF 
AND LEAVING THEIR MARK ON HIM THIS 
WHOLE DAY HAS BEEN RATHER SOMBRE 
THERE HAVE BEEN NONE OF THE 
POLITICAL FIREWORKS THAT SOME 
EXPECTED BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT 
AND THOSE TRYING TO REPLACE HIM ARE 
ALL GRIMLY AWARE THAT THERE ARE NO 
EASY SOLUTIONS IN IRAQ 
THE MILITARY SURGE IS JUST ONE PART 
OF AMERICA'S LATEST STRATY IN IRAQ 
THERE'S ALSO BEEN A CONCERTED 
EFFORT TO ENGAGE WITH SUNNI AND 
SHIA INSURGENTS FOR U. S. TROOPS ON 
THE GROUND IT'S NOT ALWAYS CLEAR 
WHO THE ENEMY IS AND WHO IS 
ACTUALLY ON SIDE PAUL WOOD HAS 
BEEN BASED WITH U. S. TROOPS AND HE 
SENT THIS REPORT 
ATTACKS ON U. S. FORCES IN IRAQ'S 
SUNNI HEART LAND HAVE FALLEN BY TWO 
THIRDS OVER THE PAST YEAR IT'S 
MAINLY DOWN TO THESE MEN THE 
CONCERNED LOCAL CITIZENS AS THEY'RE 
CALLED A SUNNI MILITIA ON THE U. S. 
PAYROLL THE AMERICANS SEE THESE 
SUNNI MILITIAMEN AS THEIR FIRST 
LINE OF DEFENCE AGAINST AL QAEDA 
THEY BELONG TO TRIBES WHO WERE 
FORMERLY CLOSE TO AL QAEDA SOME OF 
THEM ARE EVEN FORMER INSURGENTS 
THE QUESTION FOR THE AMERICANS 
HOW RELIABLE ARE THEIR NEW ALLIES 
A U. S. RAID ON THIS HOUSE TARGETED A 
MEMBER OF THE NEW SUNNI MILITIA 
WHO WAS STILL WORKING WITH THE 
INSURGENCY HE WAS KILLED ALONG 
WITH ANOTHER MAN AND HIS WIFE 
LEAVING SEVEN CHILDREN ORPHANED 
THE AMERICAN TROOPS OFFER MEDICAL 
CARE AND SWEETS FOR THE KIDS OTHER 
FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE SWORN REVENGE 
SO THERE ARE STILL DANGERS HERE FOR 
THE AMERICANS 
BRING A MEDIC WE WE FILMED THIS SNIPER ATTACK LATE LAST 
YEAR THERE HAVE BEEN OTHERS SINCE 
ALTHOUGH THEY ARE INCREASINGLY RARE 
IT'S EVIDENT WITH THE CITY RIGHT 
NOW WE DON'T GET SHOT AT WE 
HAVEN'T BEEN SHOT AT IN A LITTLE 
WHILE MOST PEOPLE ARE COMING UP TO 
US TALKING TOUS SELLING US 
PRODUCTS WHICH AT FIRST WHEN YOU 
GO INTO A STORE MOST PEOPLE SAY 
YOU KNOW LEAVE MY STORE PLEASE 
NOW THEY SAY HEY I'LL TAKE YOUR 
MONEY 
THE RISK FOR THESE AMERICAN MONEY FORCES IS THAT FUNDING A NINETY THOUSAND 
STRONG SUNNI MILITIA COULD BE 
BUILDING UP ONE SIDE IN A FUTURE 
CIVIL WAR THE PRICE OF PEACE NOW 
COULD BE MUCH WORSE BLOOD SHED 
LATER 
GERRY AND KATE MCCANN HAVE BEEN 
ASKED BY PORTUGUESE POLICE TO TAKE 
PART IN 
A RECONSTRUCTION 
OF THE 
NIGHT THEIR DAUGHTER MADELINE 
DISAPPEARED IN A SEPARATE 
DEVELOPMENT DETECTIVES HAVE 
STARTED REINTERVIEWING THE PEOPLE 
WHO HAD DINNER WITH THE MCCANNS ON 
THE NIGHT THE FOUR YEAR OLD WENT 
MISSING MISSING IN ZIMBABWE THE OPPOSITION IS 
WARNING OF BLOODSHED AND VIOLENCE 
UNLESS OTHER AFRICAN NATIONS FORCE 
ROBERT MUGABE TO RELEASE THE 
ELECTION RESULTS THE MOVEMENT FOR 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE CLAIMS THE 
RESULTS ARE BEING MANIPULATED TO 
ENGINEER A RUN OFF BETWEEN MR. 
MUGABE AND MORGAN TSVANGIRAI THE 
WARNING COMES AMID CLAIMS THAT 
THERE HAS BEEN ANOTHER SPATE OF 
TAKING LAND FROM WHITE FARMERS BY 
SOME OF THE MR. MUGABE'S SUPPORTERS 
THE B. B. C. IS BANNED FROM ZIMBABWE SO 
THIS REPORT COMES FROM JOHANNESBURG 
TEN DAYS AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION THE RESULT IS STILL NOT 
KNOWN A SECOND ROUND RUN OFF IF 
IT COMES TO THAT WILL BRING FEAR 
TO THESE STREETS FOR ZIMBABWEANS 
ASSOCIATE ELECTIONS WITH VIOLENCE 
ALREADY ELECTION OFFICIALS HAVE 
BEEN ARRESTED AS THE RULING PARTY 
TRIES TO OVERTURN AN OPPOSITION 
MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT IN THE 
COUNTRYSIDE THERE HAS BEEN A 
CHILLING PRESENTIMENT OF DREAD 
STATE TELEVISION SHOWED GROUPS OF 
LIBERATION WAR VETERANS MOVING ON 
TO WHITE OWNED FARMS AND 
PEACEFULLY FOR NOW CLAIMING THE 
LAND AS THEIR OWN 
WE CAME HERE TO OCCUPY THIS PLACE 
OCCUPYING THIS PLACE 
FROM NOW ON 
WARDS THIS IS OUR'S 
THIS WHOLE 
FARM YES 
THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED WHITE FARM YES FARMERS STILL OPERATING IN ZIMBABWE 
THEIR UNION SAYS SIXTY OF THEM HAVE 
BEEN EVICTED WITH THEIR FAMILIES 
AND THEIR LAND OCCUPIED I SPOKE TO 
THEIR PRESIDENT 
IT IS A PROCESS OF INTIMIDATION AND 
RETRIBUTION THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
BEEN INVADING THE FARMS ARE DOING 
IT AT THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THEIR 
SUPERIORS IT IS STATE SPONSORED 
AND THAT THE DISTRICT AND 
PROVINCIAL PARTY OFFICERS ARE 
INVOLVED IN COLLECTING PEOPLE 
PAYING THEM TO INVADE THESE FARMS 
PRESIDENT MUGABE USED THE WAR VETS 
TO POWERFUL EFFECT EIGHT YEARS AGO 
WHEN FOUR THOUSAND WHITE FARMS WERE TAKEN 
THROUGH THEM THE RULING PARTY CAN 
TURN VIOLENCE ON AND OFF LIKE TAP 
MR. MUGABE SAYS AN M. D. C. GOVERNMENT 
WOULD HAND THE LAND BACK TO THE 
WHITES AND ALLOW BRITAIN TO 
RECOLONISE ZIMBABWE 
THE OPPOSITION SAY MR. MUGABE WILL 
ALSO USE THE ARMY IN A NEW CAMPAIGN 
OF TERROR 
THERE HAS BEEN A 
COMPLETE MILLISATION OF ZIMBABWEAN 
SOCIETY SINCE THE NINTH OF MARCH TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
THERE HAS BEEN A COMPLETE IF YOU 
LIKE REARMING AND REMOBILISATION 
OF ALL THE POCKETS AND FACTIONS MR. MR MUGABE INTENDS TO STAY IN POWER 
COME WHAT MAY AND SO ZIMBAB WAY 
WAITS WITH GROWING TREPIDATION 
THERE HAS BEEN SOME MEMORABLE 
FOOTBALL TONIGHT IN THE LEAGUE W. 
THREE ENGLISH 
CLUBS IN 
ACTION EACH FIGHTING FOR A PLACE 
IN THE FINAL FOUR CHELSEA TOOK ON 
FENERBAHCE AT HOME BUT THE REAL 
DRAMA HAPPENED AT ANFIELD 
LIVERPOOL FANS ARE CELEBRATING A FOUR 
TWO VICTORY OVER ARSENAL WHICH SEES

ARSENAL FACING A SEASON WITHOUT 
SUCCESS SUCCESS THREE TIMES THESE TEAMS HAVE MET

CRESCENDO ON EUROPEAN NIGHTS BUT 
ARSENAL WERE NOT PUT OFF THEIR 
STRIDE THEY DOMINATED THE OPENING 
SKIRMISHES AND LOOK THE LEAD 
THROUGH ABOU DIABY BUT LIVERPOOL 
ARSENAL WOULDN'T BE THE SAME 
WITHOUT AN EQUALISER AND SURE 
ENOUGH IT SAME FROM SAMI HYYPIA'S 
PRECISE HEADER 
BREAKING ONE TO ONE JINX WOULD TAKE 
SOMETHING SPECIAL 
BUT EVEN THE BRILLIANCE OF TORRES 
WAS ECLIPSED OF THE SKILLS OF 
TEENAGER WINGER THEO WALL COT TO 
FEED THE STRIKER BUT ARSENAL'S 
CELEBRATIONS WERE SHORT LIVED AFTER 
BABBLE WAS FALLED STEVEN GERARD 
SCORED FROM THE RESULTING PENALTY 
TO GIVE LIVERPOOL A DEVISIVE 
ADVANTAGE ONE WHICH WAS CONFIRMED 
IN INJURY TIME BY BABBLE HIMSELF 
LIVERPOOL ARE THROUGH TO THEIR

ARSENAL MUST FOCUS ON TRYING TO 
CATCH MANCHESTER UNITED IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE 
LIVERPOOL'S OPPONENTS IN THE

BRIDGE BRIDGE THE CHELSEA FANS WERE IN CONFIDENT 
MOOD AMONGST THEM PETR CECH 
SPORTING AN UNPLEASANT FACIAL 
INJURY SUSTAINED DURING TRAINING 
PRIDE WOULD HAVE BEEN HURT IF THE 
HOME SIDE MESSED THIS ONE UP 
BUT IT ONLY TOOK THREE MINUTES FOR 
MICHAEL BALLACK TO SETTLE THE 
NERVES AND PUT CHELSEA AHEAD THAT 
LEAD WAS NEARLY DOUBLED WHEN JOE 
COL HE'S SHOT WAS STOPPED BY THE 
POST IT WASN'T UNTIL LATE IN THE 
SECOND HALF THAT CHELSEA CAME CLOSE 
TO SCORING AGAIN THEY WERE NEARLY 
CAUGHT OUT BY FENERBACHE WHO ONLY 
NEEDED A DRAW TO GET THROUGH 
THE ALL ENGLISH SEMIFINAL WAS 
SEALED IN THE CLOSING MINUTES
