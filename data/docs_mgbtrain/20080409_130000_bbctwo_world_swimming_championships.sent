GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO 
MANCHESTER THE ARENA IS THE 
PLACE WE WILL BE MAKING WAVES OVER 
THE NEXT FIVE DAYS WITH FORTY GOLD 
MEDALS ON OFFER THINK OF THIS IN 
TERMS OF T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY CRICKET IT IS A 
SHORT A POOL WHICH MEANS MORE TURNS 
AND FASTER TIMES IT IS A PLACE 
THAT HAS PLAYED HOST TO MADONNA AND 
KYLIE MINOGUE THIS WEEK IT IS THE 
STAGE FOR THE WORLD SHORT COURSE 
SWIMMING CHAMPIONSHIPS 
THE BEST SWIMMER IS THE START OF 
THE U. S. A. SQUAD TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD AN 
OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALLIST AND TWO 
TIMES WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP CHAMPION 
A NEW WORLD RECORD WAS SET LAST 
WEEK AND THE MAN WHOSE NICKNAME IS 
FATBOY IS IN THE SHAPE OF HIS LIFE 
THEN THERE IS THE EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD 
HANNAH MILEY AS ONE OF THE RISING 
STARS OF THE BRITISH TEAM AND SHE 
SET A EUROPEAN RECORD LAST WEEK 
AND TO LOOK AHEAD TO THE WEAK AND 
REFLECT ON THIS MORNING'S HEATS 
I'M JOINED BY ADRIAN MOORHOUSE AND 
SHARRON DAVIES WHERE DOES THIS FIT 
IN IN A VERY BUSY OLYMPIC YEAR 
IT IS A TOUGH ONE WITH ITS BEEN A 
TWENTY FIVE M. POOL IT IS NOT PREPARING YOU 
FOR BEIJING IT IS A CHANCE TO 
BRING SOME YOUNGER SWIMMERS AND THE 
MORE EXPERIENCED WINNERS ARE USING 
IT AS A WARM UP FOR BEIJING IT IS 
TOUGH I WAS TALKING EARLIER I'M 
NOT SURE I WOULD HAVE COME TO IT 
NOT BEFORE NOT BEFORE MY OLYMPICS 
THEY HAD THE BRITISH CHILD TRIALS 
LAST WEEK AND HOW LONG CAN 
SWIMMER MAINTAIN THEIR PEAK 
IT HAS 
BEEN A BUSY FEW WEEKS THEY HAD THE 
EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS WHICH WAS 
LONG COURSE THEN THEY HAD THE 
TRIALS AND NOW THEY HAVE COME HERE 
SO THEY ARE GETTING PROGRESSIVELY 
MORE TIRED THIS SUITS THE PEOPLE 
WHO CAN SPRINT CONSTANTLY IT IS 
MORE DIFFICULT IF YOU GO FROM FOUR HUNDRED 
EIGHT HUNDRED AND SO ON 
WE ARE LOOKING AT 
LIAM TAN KOK WHO DID SOMETHING 
LAST WEEK WHICH NO BRITISH WOMAN 
HAS DONE IN BRITAIN SINCE THIS MAN 
WAS IN THE POOL HE SET A NEW WORLD 
RECORD IN BRITAIN ADRIAN MOORHOUSE EQUALS THE WORLD RECORD AGAIN THAT WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY AND FOR THE LAST 
EIGHTEEN YEARS HUNDREDS OF SWIMMERS HAVE 
TRIED BUT IT HAS TAKEN THAT LONG 
FOR A BRITISH MALE SWIMMER TO SET A 
WORLD RECORD IN BRITAIN LIAM DID 
IT LAST WEEK 
I WANTED TO GIVE IT A GO IN THE 
BACKSTROKE BECAUSE I HAVE NOT DONE 
IT SINCE THE SUMMER L. WANT TO GIVE IT SHOT THAT IS WHAT I DID L. 
CAME AWAY WITH IT SO I AM PLEASED 
YOU HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD WORKING 
ON YOUR ONE HUNDRED HAVEN'T YOU 
YES ON MY 
FIRST SENIOR INTERNATIONAL I GOT A 
BRONZE MEDAL IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE L. HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD ON THE ONE HUNDRED 
I SUSPECT YOU ARE RATHER PLEASED 
FOR HIM 
THOSE RECORDS OF LONGEVITY 
AND HE WAS THE LAST PERSON TO DO IT 
IS NOT THE RECORD YOU WANT I WOULD 
RATHER BRITISH SWIMMING MOVED ON 
DON'T YOU HATE IT WHEN A FLASH OF 
NINETEEN NINETY 
YOU FEEL REALLY OLD IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE NINETEEN NINETY THAT WAS HIS DEBUT ON THE SENIOR 
SQUAD HE HAS PLENTY OF TIME HE 
HAS ONLY BEEN IN IT THREE YEARS ON 
A SENIOR LEVEL HE HAS GOT TO STEP 
UP FROM FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED BECAUSE THE FIFTY 
IS NOT IN THE OLYMPICS 
WE CAN LOOK 
AT HIM IN ACTION THIS MORNING IN 
THE HEATS FOR THE ONE HUNDRED M. BACKSTROKE 
HE IS IN LANE SIX SHARON WHAT DID 
YOU MAKE OF HIM 
HE WENT DOWN VERY 
VERY HARD WHICH IS TYPICAL OF 
SOMEBODY WHO HAS A STRONG FIFTY THE 
FIELD DID COME BACK ON HIM IN THE 
REST OF THE RACE HE WANTED TO SWIM 
THE ONE HUNDRED LAST WEEK THAT HE COULDN'T 
BECAUSE HE WAS PRE SELECTED ALREADY 
HE WAS ON GREAT FORM THERE WAS 
THIS FEELING HE WAS FRUSTRATED THAT 
HE COULD NOT GET IN AND ATTACKED 
THE WORLD RECORD ON ONE HUNDRED M. ACTING 
YOU WILL HAVE A GOOD GO TONIGHT HE HE IS IN HIS SEMI FINAL TONIGHT YES YES THE FINAL IS TOMORROW MATT CLEY 
MATT CLEY DID NOT MAKE THE TEAM LAST WEEK AT 
THE TRIALS HE IS RANKED NO EIGHT IN 
THE WORLD L. THINK HE HAD A LOT OF 
THINGS TO PROVE HERE SO HE AND 
LIAM WILL BE CHALLENGING FOR THE 
MEDALS HE WAS OVERTAKEN A LITTLE 
BIT IN THE MIDDLE BY MARCUS ROGAN 
COULD BE CONTENDER FOR MEDAL 
HE HAS A GREAT CHANCE THERE ARE 
SOME GOOD EUROPEAN SWIMMERS 
IN THIS 
WE MENTIONED LAST WEEK IN THE 
TRIALS THAT PLACE IN SHEFFIELD 
MY HUGE WEEK IN TERMS OF 
QUALIFICATION FOR THE OLYMPICS 
LIAM WILL BE THERE WHAT OF THE 
REST REST REBECCA BOOK HER PLACE AT THE 
OLYMPICS IN THE TWO HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED FREE 
SHE WAS SURPRISED WITH THE RECORDS 
I JUST THOUGHT I'M GOING TO GO FOR 
IT IT WAS AMAZING 
A ANOTHER 
TEENAGER BROKE THE BRITISH RECORD 
IN THE ONE HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED FLY ON HER EIGHTEENTH 
BIRTHDAY SHE IS ON HER WAY TO 
BEIJING 
I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT I BEIJING THOUGHT I WOULD GET THE TIME THEN 
I LOOKED AT THE SCOREBOARD AND I 
COULDN'T BELIEVE IT 
KATE WAS YOUNG SPORTS PERSONALITY 
OF THE YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND THREE NOW TWENTY ONE SHE IS 
FLYING HIGH AND SO TO NEW BRITISH 
RECORD IN THE BREASTSTROKE HER 
SPORTING HERO IS SHARRON DAVIES 
JAMES GODDARD WAS FOURTH IN ATHENS 
JUST MISSING OUT ON A MEDAL AND HE 
DID ENOUGH TO EARN HIMSELF ANOTHER 
GO IN THE TWO HUNDRED BACK AND TWO HUNDRED I AM IT IT IS A RELIEF L. CAN'T WAIT FOR 
BEIJING NOW 
ONE OF THE SCOTTISH STARS OF THE 
COMMONWEALTH GAMES IN MELBOURNE WAS 
GREG TAIT AND HE QUALIFIED IN THE 
ONE HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED BACKSTROKE ANOTHER 
DOUBLE COMMONWEALTH GOLD MEDALLIST 
FOR SCOTLAND WAS CAITLIN WHO HAS 
QUALIFIED FOR THE ONE HUNDRED FREE WITH A 
NEW BRITISH RECORD AND THE TWO HUNDRED FREE 
ON HER WAY TO THE OLYMPICS FOR THE 
FIRST TIME WILL BE HANNAH MILEY WHO 
SET TWO BRITISH RECORDS AND ALSO 
BROKE THE EUROPEAN RECORD 
BROKE THE EUROPEAN RECORD 
IN THE 
FOUR HUNDRED I AM AND CHRIS COOK BECAME THE 
FIRST BRITON TO GO UNDER THE ONE 
MINUTE BARRIER FOR THE ONE HUNDRED 
BREASTSTROKE LONG COURSE WHEN HE 
BEAT HIS TEAM MATE CHRIS GILCHRIST 
BOTH WILL BE IN CHINA 
WE HAVE 
CHANGED OUR TRAINING TO PREPARE FOR 
THIS IT IS ALL ABOUT PREPARATION 
THE OTHER BIG HEADLINE WAS MADE BY 
MARK FOSTER WHO HAS QUALIFIED FOR 
THE OLYMPICS BY THAT TIME HE WILL 
BE THIRTY EIGHT YEARS OLD CONCENTRATING ON 
SOME OF THE ONES WE SAW THERE WHO 
IMPRESSED YOU LAST WEEK REBECCA REBECCA WAS PROBABLY MY FAVOURITE FOR THE 
WEEK SHE BROKE AN OLD BRITISH 
RECORD THAT SARAH HARDCASTLE HAS 
HELD FOR MANY YEARS IN THE EIGHT HUNDRED SHE 
IS ONLY A COUPLE OF SECONDS AWAY 
FROM THE WORLD RECORD IT IS HER 
MAJORITY ALIKE ALL THE YOUNG GIRLS 
ARE GOOD NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR OLDS THEY 
ARE LOOKING GREAT AND FUNNY ENOUGH 
IT WAS THE OLDER GUYS CHRIS COOK 
MARK FOSTER GREGAN TAIT THEY ARE 
IN THERE LATE TWENTIES 
I WOULD ECHO 
THAT WHAT STOOD AT FOR ME IS THE 
YOUNGER GIRLS GROUP MENTION HIS 
SYSTEM IN PLACE TO 
OF TWELVE 
SYSTEM IN PLACE TO GET GIRLS OF TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN IN THEY HAVE OUTLASTED THAT 
BUT THE SYSTEM THAT WAS PUT IN 
PLACE IS PAYING OFF COACHES NOW 
KNOW WHAT TO DO IS TAKE TO PRODUCE 
WORLD CLASS SWIMMING CHRIS COOK 
IMPRESSED ME AS WELL 
WE ARE GOING 
TO TALK ABOUT BILL SWEETNAM AND THE 
CHANGES TO THE COACHING SET UP IT 
IS DIFFERENT NOW FROM THE DAYS OF 
THE TOUGH TALKING TYRANT 
EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE EVERY EVENT 
CAN BE ONE WE HAVE TO HAVE A TEAM 
WERE SIXTY TO SEVENTY PER CENT OF THE TEAM BELIEVE 
NOT HOPE THAT THEY HAVE REALISTIC 
CHAMPIONS CHANCES 
NO ONE CAN 
ACCUSE HIM OF LACKING AMBITION HE 
WAS OUTSPOKEN UNFORGIVING AND 
UNCOMPROMISING HIS SUCCESSOR IS 
MICHAEL SCOTT WHO IS ALSO 
AUSTRALIAN BUT THERE THE 
COMPARISON ENDS 
WHEN YOU COME TO 
THE OLYMPIC TRIALS YOU HAVE TO BE 
PHYSICALLY WELL CONDITIONS BUT ALSO 
IT IS THE MENTAL PART OF THINGS 
TRUST STRESS IMPACTS ON 
PERFORMANCE 
IF YOU DON'T ENJOY PERFORMANCE WHAT YOU DO AND JOHN NOTT RELAXED 
YOU PUT PRESSURE ON YOURSELF WE 
WANT TO ENJOY THE MOMENT HAPPY HAPPY TEAM IS RUN BY A HAPPY MANAGER AS 
WELL HOW DO YOU SEE YOUR JOB TO TO CREATE THE THEATRE FOR THE COACHES 
AND THE ATHLETES TO PERFORM L. AM 
NOT THERE TO TELL THE COACHES HAVE 
TO COACH THEIR SWIMMERS 
THERE IS A 
NICE MIX IN THE TEAM YOU HAVE 
EXPERIENCE FROM MARK AND THE 
YOUNGSTERS WHO ARE DOING WELL DO 
YOU THINK THAT MAKES A NICE STRONG 
TEAM 
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THE OLDER TEAM ATHLETES CAN ACT AS MENTORS TO THE 
YOUNGER SWIMMERS BUT THE YOUNGER 
SWIMMERS ARE GETTING EXPERIENCE 
TOKELY FOR TWO THOUSAND TWELVE HAVING THAT MIX OF 
EXPERIENCE AND YOUTH IS CRITICAL 
FOR A SUCCESSFUL TEAM YOU NEED THE 
GUYS AT THE TOP WHO HAVE BEEN 
AROUND WITH THE EXPERIENCE WHILST 
WE HAVE VERY GOOD YOUNG TEAM 
COMING THROUGH GOING INTO THE 
OLYMPICS YOU NEED PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
BEEN AROUND BEFORE TO HELP STEER 
THEM IN THE RIGHT WAY 
IT IS MUSIC TO MY EARS TO HEAR THAT 
BECAUSE SOMETHING MISSING FROM 
BRITISH SWIMMING IS THAT ONE SIZE 
FITS ALL AND THAT IS NOT THE CASE 
IS IT YOU CANNOT TREAT SOMEONE 
LIKE MARK FOSTER THE SAME AS 
ANYBODY ELSE 
WE NEED TO RESPECT 
INDIVIDUAL NEEDS L. THINK THEY CAN 
BOTH OCCUR TOGETHER HARMONIOUSLY 
YOU CAN HAVE RULES IN THE TEAM BUT 
RESPECT THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS BASED 
ON THE DIVERSE RANGE OF AGES OF THE 
SWIMMERS WE WILL HAVE 
THE YOU HAVE MADE FOR A LONG TIME 
IS YOU HAVE TO BE GOOD MAN MANAGER 
I'D DON'T CRITICISE THE MANAGER HARD LINE ON TRAINING THAT IS 
PAYING DIVIDENDS HIS MANAGEMENT 
SKILLS WERE TERRIBLE AND THE 
ATMOSPHERE AROUND THE SWIMMING POOL 
AT ALL THE MAJOR EVENTS FOR THE 
LAST SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS HAS BEEN 
TERRIBLE SO ALL THAT TRAINING 
WON'T COME THROUGH IF THEY ARE 
SCARED 
TO GIVE HIM SOME CREDIT SCARED THE STRUCTURE HE PUT IN PLACE IS 
WORKING 
I DO A LOT OF WORK IN WORKING BUSINESS AND A TEAM LEADER COMES IN 
TO SHAKE THE ORGANISATION UP 
NECESSARILY IT DOES NOT SUE THE 
ORGANISATION WHEN IT HAS CHANGED 
HE HAD MADE A LOT OF ENEMIES AND 
THERE WAS NO WAY HE WAS GOING TO 
STAY NOW PEOPLE ARE RELAXING WITH 
THE SYSTEM HE DID SHAKE IT UP AND 
DID THINGS WE WOULD NEVER HAVE 
CHANGED HE HAS LET PEOPLE LOOSE 
AND NOW UNDER THAT ATTITUDE THERE 
ATTITUDE IS FANTASTIC 
HE IS AN ADMINISTRATOR ELEVEN THE 
COACH IS TO COACH WHICH IS WHAT 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BEFORE WHERE 
HE IS HE NOW 
IN AUSTRALIA 
NEIGHBOUR THE NOSE 
IT IS A SHAME 
NOBODY KNOWS MAYBE SOME PEOPLE 
WERE RUBBED UP THE WRONG WAY BY 
BILL BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO BUT 
NOW THEY ARE ABLE TO BE A THIRTY EIGHT YEAR 
OLD IN A TEAM INCLUDING FIFTEEN YEAR 
OLDS THAT IS A MASSIVE 
GENERATIONAL DIFFERENCE YOU HAVE 
TO COACH PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY YOU YOU CANNOT COACH HANNAH MILEY AT EIGHTEEN THE 
SAME WAY AS BOSS DEATH AT THIRTY EIGHT 
FOSTER MARK FOSTER L. THINK SO 
YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THIS 
SPOTLIGHTS SWIMMING ROUND BEHIND ME 
THE ARENA IS A PLACE WHERE 
MADONNA HAS PLAYED KYLIE MINOGUE 
TAKE THAT IT WAS OPENED BY TORVILL 
AND DEAN BUT IT HAS NEVER HOSTED 
HIS SWIMMING MEET BEFORE AND THAT 
IS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ACTUALLY 
HAVE SWIMMING POOL THAT IS A GIANT BATH 
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THESE 
PROJECT FOR NEARLY THREE AND A HALF 
YEARS AND FINALLY IT HAS COME TO 
FRUITION THIS PAST MONTH 
WE ARE 
USED TO VENUES AND CONCERTS WHICH 
ONLY LAST FOR A FEW DAYS HOURS AND 
DAYS 
WE ARE NOT USED TO HAVING DAYS SOMETHING TAKE OVER OUR BUILDING 
THE THIRTY FOUR DAYS AS THIS EVENT WILL DO 
THE WHOLE BILL THING FROM START TO 
COMPLETION WAS TWELVE DAYS 
BUILDING 
WE THINK THAT IS A RECORD ACTUALLY 
WE WERE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETES 
BY 
AFTER ABOUT FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN DAYS WE BY WERE ALWAYS READY TO ACCEPT 
SWIMMERS THE CHAMPION SHIP POOL IS 
TWENTY FIVE METRES 
WE HAVE TWELVE MILLION 
LITRES OF WATER IN THERE WE HAVE A 
WARM UP POOL OF TWENTY FIVE METRES WE HAVE 
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND LITRES IN THAT POOL THAT 
IS A LOT OF WATER BECAUSE THE 
ARENA CANNOT HAVE ANYTHING FIXED 
INTO THE FLOOR WE HAVE A SUSPENDED 
STRUCTURE IT IS BASICALLY A FALSE 
FLOOR OVER THE TOP OF THE CRADLES 
THEN WE PUT THE BUCKET IN IT FILL 
IT WITH WATER AND OFF WE GO THIS 
FLAW MIGHT LOOK LIKE IN IT IS THERE 
PERMANENTLY BUT IT IS TWO AND A 
HALF METRES ABOVE THE NORMAL FLOOR 
YOU WILL SEE THOUSANDS OF MILES OF 
PIPE WORKS AND UNEASE WATER 
TREATMENT PLANTS BASICALLY 
WALKWAYS UNDERNEATH TANKS TANKS FILTERS PALMS TOGETHER WITH HEAT 
PUMPS AND A GENERATOR WHICH HAS TO 
BE BROUGHT IN ESPECIALLY TO HEAT 
THE POOL THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR 
AS A IS GETTING THE HEAT UP THE THE CHEMICAL LEVELS ALREADY FOR FRIDAY 
THAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED VERY NICELY 
AND IN FACT THE WATER IS TOO HARD 
THE CHALLENGE HAS BEEN TESTING THE 
WATER IN 
AND IT WILL BE A 
CHALLENGE TO GET IT OUT QUICKLY AS 
WELL SO WE CAN DO EVERYTHING ELSE 
THE SHEER WEIGHT OF THE POOL ON OUR 
BUILDING AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE 
HAVE A SHOW COMING IN AS SOON AS 
THIS EVENT FINISHES AND WE HAVE TO 
BE READY FOR THAT ONE WE HAVE SIXTY 
DAYS TO MOVE IT 
WE HAVE TO BE OUT 
BY MIDNIGHT ON THE TWENTY FIRST SIX DAYS 
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE GONE THAT 
WILL BE A CHALLENGE IN ITSELF AND 
THAT SHOW WILL BE SO A LENE DION 
THAT WILL GIVE A WHOLE NEW MEANING 
TO FALLING INTO YOU SALEEM 
THE COST OF THE OLYMPICS HAVE 
SPIRALLED SHOULD THEY BE THINKING 
ABOUT PUTTING IN A TEMPORARY POOL 
INSTEAD YOU GO FIRST BECAUSE YOU 
THINK THEY SHOULD AND I THINK A BIT 
OF BOTH 
I LOVE THE IDEA OF A 
LEGACY I THINK THEY SHOULD 
ABSOLUTE THE BUILD A TEMPORARY POOL 
IN THE EXISTING STADIUM 
I AGREE ON 
THE LEGACY QUESTION L. WOULD LIKE 
TO SPEND ALL OF THAT MONEY ON 
TRAINING CALLS FOR OUR SWIMMERS 
TRAINING SWIMMING POOLS BUT WHAT 
IS THE POINT OF A TEN THOUSAND THE SEATER 
STADIUM WHEN THAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
DO NOT WATCH SWIMMING DAY IN DAY 
OUT 
I WAS CHATTING TO US WHETHER OUT WHO HAD SWUM IN THE SAME POOL IN 
RIO DE JANEIRO AND BARBADOS THAT 
IS STRANGE BUT PEOPLE LIKE TO GO 
IN THESE SWIMMING POOLS BECAUSE 
THEY CAN GO FASTER AND THEM WHAT 
YOU ARE DOING IS PUTTING THE POOL 
IN A VENUE WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN 
BUILT 
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUILD THE BUILT INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND THE STADIUM 
COULD YOU HAVE A PERMANENT 
STRUCTURE FOR THE POOL THAT TAKE 
THE WATER OUT AND USE IT MUCH MORE 
OFTEN FOR OTHER THINGS 
BUILD OVER 
IT INSTEAD OF BRINGING IN A 
TEMPORARY POOL MAKE THE POOL THAT 
YOU BUILD ABLE TO TRANSFER INTO A 
STAGE SURELY YOU COULD PEOPLE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT BUT BUT THE TRADITIONAL ATTITUDE OF 
BUILDING MASSIVE FACILITIES IN THE 
PAST OLYMPICS WITH JUST A BIT OF 
CREATIVITY AND THEY HAVE SHOWN IT 
HERE AND FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS 
THAT IT CAN BE DONE AT A FRACTION 
OF 
THE COST L. AGREE WITH ADRIAN THE AT IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE A 
FIFTY M. POOL SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
FOR TRAINING FACILITIES 
IT IS A 
SHAME WE CANNOT HAVE TRAINING 
FACILITIES AND ONE SHOWCASE STADIUM 
FOR MAJOR EVENTS WE DO NOT HAVE 
THAT WHICH IS A SHAME FOR A COUNTRY 
LIKE THE U. K. WE GO ABROAD AND THEY 
PUT THIS TO SHOW ME THEIR 
FACILITIES I LIKE THE IDEA OF A 
LEGACY THEY DID IT IN MELBOURNE 
THEY HAD 
SWIMMING 
POOLS FOR FIFTY M. BUT THEY STILL USE 
THE TENNIS COURTS BECAUSE THEY 
COULD GET MORE PEOPLE OWN THAT WAS 
THAT ROD LAVER 
WHO ARE THE BIG 
NAME STARS THIS WEEK IF IT WAS NOT 
FOR MY WILL PHELPS THIS MAN WOULD 
BE THE BEST SWIMMING IN THE WORLD 
MICHAEL PHELPS AT TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD 
THE HAS TWO GOALS AT WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS IT WOULD BE MORE IF 
IT WAS NOT FOR MICHAEL PHELPS WE 
HAVE BEEN TALKING TO THE MAN WHO 
COULD DOMINATE THIS WEEK 
YOU ARE HERE MICHAEL IS NOT HERE 
IS THIS A CHANCE FOR YOU TO GET 
SOME PRESTIGE GRAB THE HEADLINES 
WHILE HE IS 
NOT AROUND L. REALLY DO NOT THINK A ABOUT IT THAT MUCH HE HE IS LIKE ONE OF MY GOOD FRIENDS HE 
CAN HAVE THE SPOTLIGHT I DO NOT 
MIND LOOKING AT YOUR PROGRAMME 
THIS WEEK WHEN YOU EVER BE OUT OF 
THE POOL 
I DO NOT 
THINK SO L. L. THINK I HAVE TWO EVENTS A DAY AT 
THE OLYMPIC TRIALS I WILL BE 
SWIMMING A LOT OF DIFFERENT EVENTS 
BACK TO BACK SO I AM GOING TO HAVE 
TO START LEARNING AND TRAINING 
THIS IS THE PERFECT EVENT TO START 
TRAINING FOR IT TELL ME FIRST 
DOUBLE WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING TO GET 
OUT OF THIS 
IT IS BASICALLY A LONG 
COURSE YEAR WITH A SHORT COURSE AT 
THE BEGINNING AS LONG AS I GET 
CLOSE TO MY TIMES THAT WOULD BE 
AWESOME 
I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF MY AWESOME SEASON OF TRAINING SO I AM TIRED 
AND BROKEN DOWN L. AM STILL DOING 
WEIGHTS AND SWIMMING MY BODY IS 
STILL PAINFUL RYAN LOCHTE IS 
STARTING TO SWIM AWAY 
SURELY NOT 
RYAN LOCHTE IS GOING TO GET IT FIFTEEN 
FOUR POINT THREE TWO HE HAS DONE IT YOU ALWAYS 
PLAY DOWN AT CHANCES WHICH IS A 
WORRY WITH THE AMERICANS 
WILL WE 
GET A WORLD RECORD ON YOU THIS 
WEEK I SURE HOPE SO 
THAT WOULD BE 
AWESOME WE ARE JUST GOING TO RACE 
STUFF I DO NOT KNOW IF THERE WILL 
BE WORLD RECORDS THEY SAY THAT IS 
AWESOME MORE POWER TO THE PEOPLE 
THAT DO IT IFS SO THAT IS 
AWESOME 
WEEK GET THEIR MESSAGE AWESOME HE IS AWESOME HE IS FROM A FLORIDA 
HE WAS SWIMMING IN THE HEATS THIS 
MORNING ALL FIFTY AND ONE HUNDRED M. RACES GO 
TO THE SEMI FINALS TONIGHT HE IS 
ELAINE TWO HE ONLY QUALIFIED FOUR 
FASTEST IS HE TAKING IT EASY HE 
IS NOT PRIMARILY A BREASTSTROKE 
SWIMMER 
HE IS USING THIS AS A SWIMMER WARM UP FOR BEIJING TO TEST HIMSELF 
TO SEE IF HE CAN WORK AS HARD IN 
HIS NONE PREFERRED EVENTS IT IS 
PRETTY GOOD TO DO A TIME OF FIFTY EIGHT BOY 
NINETY EIGHT IN YOUR NONE PREFERRED EVENT 
FIFTY EIGHT POINT NINE EIGHT JUST TO CLEAR UP SOMETHING 
IS ON THIS MORNING 
DARREN HAS NOT 
QUALIFIED BUT JAMES GIBSON HAS SIX 
FASTEST WE WILL SEE HIM AGAINST 
RYAN LOCHTE THE DISAPPOINTMENT IS 
THAT WE WERE NOT SEE CHRIS COOK 
AGAINST RYAN LOCHTE 
MAYBE IT IS 
GOOD FOR CHRIS TO GET BACK INTO 
HARD WORK 
YOU ARE SAYING THAT 
CHRIS HAS TO GET BACK INTO HARD 
WORK I AM SURE YOU WILL 
HERE IS 
SOME ACTION WITH COMMENTARY YOU 
MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT WE HAVE NOT 
HEARD FROM ANDREW JAMES IN YET 
THIS IS THE TWO HUNDRED M. FLY HE TWO THE 
WOMEN GREAT BRITISH RECORDS HERE JEMMA LOWE GOT AN AMAZING TIME OF WILL SHE GO FORWARD IN THE HEATS I 
HOPE SO 
IT LOOKS LIKE SHE IS 
JEMMA LOWE IS SOMEBODY TO WATCH 
SHE HAS A BEAUTIFUL STROKE A VERY 
TOUGH COMPETITOR L. WOULD EXPECT IT 
TO BREAK THE RECORD NOW OR TONIGHT 
JEMMA LOWE A WONDERFUL BRITISH 
RECORD AT THE TRIALS JUST UNDERNEATH THE BRITISH RECORD 
HERE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE AT THE FIFTY SHE DOES NOT 
USE TOO MUCH ENERGY GOING UP AND 
DOWN ALL THAT ENERGY IS USED TO GO 
FORWARD THAT IS THE WORLD RECORD 
LINE 
AND THIS IS JUST A HEAP OF LINE THE TWO HUNDRED M. BUTTERFLY HEAT JEMMA LOWE IS STAYING CLOSE TO THE 
WORLD RECORD LINE 
I THINK SHE 
COULD TIGHTEN UP HER TURNING IN THE 
FINAL SHE KEEPS HER HEAD LOW A 
FANTASTIC VICTORY YOU KNOW YOU ARE DOMINATING THE 
RACE IF IN THE CAMERA SHOT THERE IS 
JUST ONE SWIMMING SHE REALLY IS 
GOING FOR IT THE BRITISH RECORD HAS GOT TO GO 
IT IS DO OH OH SIX SHE HAS TO COME BACK 
IN THIRTY THREE TWO HUNDRED SIX IT WILL BE TIGHT BUT 
I THINK SHE WILL DO IT A REAL TALENT FOR THE FUTURE ONE 
IMAGINE IN THE FINAL THAT SHE WILL 
GO FASTER THAN THIS JEMMA LOWE HAS DONE IT THE BRITISH 
RECORD HAS GONE ALMOST FOURTEEN SEC FOR 
INSIDE THE BRITISH RECORD WON A 
FULL SECOND INSIDE THE BRITISH 
RECORD A LOT MORE TO SEE FROM JEMMA LOWE 
HERE AND IN BEIJING SHE LOOKS 
NONPLUSSED SHE HAS REWRITTEN THE 
RECORD BROOKS NO BRITISH SWIMMER 
HAS SWUM FASTER THAN HER AT THIS 
EVENT A SHORT COURSE OR A LONG 
PAUSE LONG PAUSE SHE HAS A HARD 
WORK ETHIC SHE IS BENEFITING FROM THE WORK 
THAT SHE HAS DONE WITH THEIR COACH 
YOU ARE SMILING AT THE SCHOOL 
CHILDREN ABOVE ME SHOUTING FOR YOU 
HOW DO YOU FEEL AMAZING BEING BEING HERE IS JUST UNREAL L. AM JUST 
EXCITED TO BE IN THE RACE AFTER THE 
HYPE LAST WEEK THAT IS YOUR THIRD 
BRITISH RECORD IN ONE WEEK YOU 
LOOK GREAT YOU ON THE WORLD RECORD 
PACE IT COULD BE ON TONIGHT L. DID 
NOT WANT TO KILL MYSELF THIS 
MORNING IT WAS NICE TO COME TO THE 
RACE WITH NO PRESSURE L. JUST 
ENJOYED IT L. WAS PLEASED WITH THE 
RESULTS WE ARE SAYING SOMETHING 
SPECIAL HERE IN MANCHESTER GOOD 
LUCK FELICITY OF AUSTRALIA IN LANE FOUR 
MISSED THE OLYMPIC TEAM BUT ONLY 
JUST I EXPECT SOMETHING QUICK FROM 
THERE THE AMERICAN IS QUICK IN LANE TWO JESSICA DIGGINS IS EUROPEAN JUNIOR 
CHAMPION ON THE TOUR WE HAVE SOME 
REALLY GREAT YOUNG PEOPLE COMING 
THROUGH THE FINAL HEAT OF THE WOMEN'S TWO HUNDRED M. 
BUTTERFLY JESSICA OF GREAT BRITAIN 
FIRST UP SHE IS ONLY TWO FROM THE 
BOTTOM OF THAT PICTURE A GOOD COMFORTABLE FIRST TWENTY FIVE NO JUST COMING BACK FROM ILLNESS THIS IS VERY GOOD TO SEE THE 
BRITISH RACING AGAINST THE 
AUSTRALIANS AND AMERICANS AND 
CERTAINLY JESSICA IS LOOKING VERY 
GOOD GOOSTREY ALIEN LOOK AS THOUGH 
SHE TURNED FIRST THE AUSTRALIAN WE SAW THIS AT THE OLYMPIC TRIALS 
LAST WEEK WHEN ONE SWIMMER SET A 
RECORD AND THAT INSPIRED THE NEXT 
SWIMMER TO DO IT THESE GIRLS URGE 
EACH OTHER ON AND IT IS GREAT TO 
SEE FROM JESSICA DICKONS THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY TIGHT 
AGAIN I THINK IT IS JUST GOING TO 
BE OUTSIDE THAT BRITISH RECORD THAT 
WAS SET BY GEMMA LOW IN THE 
PREVIOUS HEAT THIS IS GOING TO BE 
TIGHT IT IS GOING TO BE A GREAT FINAL AUSTRALIA WINNING THAT RELATIVELY 
EASY I THINK BUT JESSICA DICKONS 
DOING WELL TO QUALIFY IN ONE OF HER 
FAVOURITE POSITIONS THE 
OPPORTUNITY IS THERE FOR THE 
BRITISH SWIMMERS TONIGHT IT IS A 
WEAKER FIELD LOT OF THE WORLD 
BEST ARE NOT HERE IN THIS RACE BUT 
YOU HAVE TO BEAT THOSE IN THE RACE 
SO FOR OUR LADIES TONIGHT THERE ARE 
MEDALS TO BE ONE 
CONFIRMATION OF 
THAT FINAL HEAT A GREAT PERSONAL BEST TIME SO THAT 
HELPS BUT SOME OF THE 
DISAPPOINTMENT SO MAYBE THIS IS 
YOUR OLYMPICS 
IT WAS A BIT OF A 
DISAPPOINTMENT AND I MAY HAVE LOST 
A BIT OF CONFIDENCE L. HAD JUST 
BEEN GIVEN A BOOST 
YOU QUALIFIED 
THIRD FASTER SO YOU ARE IN PLACE 
FOR A MEDAL 
I AM LOOKING FORWARD 
TO IT WE ARE USED TO RACING 
AGAINST EACH OTHER 
GOOD STUFF FROM 
THE TWO OF THEM LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
AT THE FINAL LIST WHO HAVE THEY 
GOT TO LOOK OUT FOR 
I THINK 
PROBABLY THE AMERICANS AND THE 
AUSTRALIANS THE USUAL PEOPLE 
FELICITY DAHL THEIRS WAS THIRD AT 
THE AUSTRALIAN TRIALS 
WHAT ABOUT 
THE ESTONIAN WHO DID NOT FINISH 
SOMETIMES IT DOES GET A BIT WAY THE 
END YOU CAN GET MOUTHFUL OF WATER 
AND YOU START TO CHOKE AND USE 
STOCK IT DOES NOT HAPPEN VERY 
OFTEN BUT TODAY IT HAS HAPPENED 
TWICE 
AT THIS LEVEL YOU SHOULD BE TWICE ABLE TO COPE WITH IT 
THE FINAL IS 
AT SEVEN THIRTY FIVE P. M. AND IT IS LIVE THE 
QUESTION OF THE SWIMMERS WHO ARE 
ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE IN A 
SHORT A POOL WHO DOES IT SUIT 
PEOPLE OFTEN SAY BEING TALL IS 
GOOD THING IT IS A BIT LIKE 
THROWING A BALL AT WALL THROW 
BIGGER BALL AT A WALL HARDER AND IT 
WILL BOUNCE BACK FASTER WE HAVE 
JAMES HICKMAN WHO IS HELPING TO 
ORGANISE THIS EVENT TODAY HE IS A 
BRILLIANT SHORT COURSE WOMEN AND 
LOT OF OUR SQUAD A QUITE SMALL BUT BUT IF YOU HAVE TO BE BRILLIANT AT 
TURNING 
ABSOLUTELY IT IS OFF THE TURNING WALL AND BE ABLE TO GET A HUGE 
DISTANCE FROM THE FIRST FIFTY M. OFF THE 
WALL AND JAMES HICKMAN WAS GREAT AT 
THAT 
BUT NOT MORE THAN FIFTEEN METRES THAT BECAUSE WE HAD A QUARK 
DISQUALIFICATION ABOUT THAT AS WELL 
HANNAH MILEY WAS THUS WINNING THIS 
MORNING IN THE HEATS OF THE 
INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY SWIMMING IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE BALANCE WITHIN THE FOUR STROKES IT IS VERY CLOSE FAST TURNOVER ON THE BACKSTROKE 
THAT IS HANNAH MILEY IN THE BLUE

PICKING UP WHERE SHE LEFT OFF IN 
THE OLYMPIC TRIALS SHE IS LOOKING

OFF THE BRITISH RECORD THE SHORT 
COURSE EVENT AS A TWENTY FIVE M. COURSE BUT 
SHE HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN THE 
LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS SHE IS ALMOST GOING TO LAP THE SWIMMER IN LANE EIGHT GOOD BREASTSTROKE VERY INTERESTING 
ON BREASTSTROKE IT IS STROKE WAY

OTHER AND WORKS TOGETHER

WHAT IS THE SEEMING MORNING THING 
SWIMMERS GENERALLY SWIM THAT IN THE 
EVENINGS DO THEY 
MOST PEOPLE DO 
HISTORICALLY IT HAS BEEN THE HEATS 
IN THE MORNING AND THE FINALS IN 
THE EVENING SO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE 
HAD TO PEAK TO GET A MEDAL ALSO 
YOU CAN WAKE UP A BIT MORE GENTLY 
ALTHOUGH WITH THE FINALS IN BEIJING 
BEING IN THE MORNING YOU HAVE NO 
CHOICE YOU HAVE TO GOT IN YOU 
HAVE GOT TO GET UP AND GO AND RACE 
YOU HAVE GOT TO PREPARE YOURSELF 
FOR THE CONDITIONS AT THE TIME TO 
MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE FINAL TO 
WIN MEDAL 
NOW HE IS IN BUSINESS 
HE HAS NO SYMPATHY WHATSOEVER I I DON'T HAVE SYMPATHY FOR ANYBODY WHO 
MESSES IT UP IN THE MORNING BECAUSE 
THEY DID NOT GET UP ON TIME HOW 
PROFESSIONAL IS THAT 
IF YOU ARE 
SOMEBODY LIKE ADRIAN MOORHOUSE AND 
HAVE A COUPLE OF SECONDS IN THE 
BACK YOU DON'T HAVE TO PERFORM A 
PERSONAL BEST IN THE MORNING BUT 
IF IT TAKES A PERSONAL BEST TO GET 
INTO THAT FINAL YOU HAVE TO BE ON 
THE BEST FORM IN THE MORNING THIS IS THE FIRST OF THE BIG SHEETS HEATS DAVID CAREY IS THE FOUR HUNDRED M. FREESTYLE 
SWIMMER THIS IS ALMOST LIKE A 
SPRINT NOWADAYS YES THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO GO FLAT

NOT SUITED TO DAVID CARRY PRIMARILY

NOW AFTER HIM IN THE BLUE SWIMMING 
HAT HE REALLY DOES NEED TO PUT ON 
THE MAJORS FILIPPO MAGNINI DOES 
NOT LOOK GOOD NEXT TO HIM

FANTASTIC DAVID CARRY DID NOT MAKE 
THE OLYMPICS TEAM ON THE INDIVIDUAL 
TWO HUNDRED M. ON THIS EVENT BUT HE REALLY 
IS LEADING OUT 
HE NEEDS TO BECAUSE 
WE HAVE HAD A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN ALREADY THEY 
HAVE TO BE IN UNDER THAT TO MAKE 
THE FINAL DAVID CARRY IS THE FIRST 
FILIPPO MAGNINI IS SECONDS JUST 
ABOUT SECOND DAVID CARRY JUST 
WINS IT JUST OUTSIDE THE BRITISH 
RECORD THAT IS A VERY GOOD HEAT 
SWIM ABSOLUTELY 
HE LOOKS REALLY PLEASED WITH THAT HE JUST HOLDS OFF FILIPPO MAGNINI 
REALLY VERY CLOSE IN FACT THEY ARE 
EQUAL SECOND PLACE BUT DAVID CARRY 
JUST HELD ON FOR FIRST HE IS IN FIRST QUALIFICATION

HEATS TO GO DAVID CARRY IN POLE

THANK YOU HEAT NINE OF THE MEN'S TWO HUNDRED M. 
FREESTYLE THE SECOND OF THE 
FASTEST HEATS KENRICK MONK IS THE 
FASTEST SEED IN LANE FOUR HE NINE OF THE MEN'S TWO HUNDRED M. FREESTYLE 
ANDREW HUNTER OF GREAT BRITAIN HE 
WAS PART OF THAT RELAY TEAM THAT 
BEAT AUSTRALIA EXTRAORDINARY FOR 
THE SCOTTISH WAITING FOR QUIET HEAT NINE OF TEN ANDREW HUNTER FROM 
GREAT BRITAIN IS IN LANE TWO 
KENRICK MONK OF AUSTRALIA IS THE 
FASTEST SPEED AND HE IS INANE FOUR 
THERE IS NOBODY IN LANE ONE WHICH 
IS GOOD NEWS FOR ANDREW HUNTER 
CLEAN WATER ABOVE HIM KENRICK MONK IS THE QUALITY 
SWIMMING IN THE FIELD IN A FIFTY M. HE 
IS ONLY ONE OF THE SWIMMERS IN THE 
TOP TEN OF THE WORLD TO BE HERE ON 
FORM A GREAT PERFORMANCE IN THE 
AUSTRALIAN TRIALS QUALIFIED FOR 
BEIJING ANDREW HUNTER REALLY HAS 
HIS WORK THAT OUT BUT THEY THINK HE 
HAS IT IN HIM HE IS IN THE BLUE 
SWIMMING CAP HIS WORK CUT OUT 
BUT I THINK HE HAS IT IN HIM HE 
MIGHT BE TAKING INDEED ON THE FIRST 
ONE HUNDRED 
THIS IS VERY INTERESTING ONE HUNDRED INDEED FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN IS GOOD THEY WILL 
HAVE TO GO QUICKLY BECAUSE IT IS 
EXTREMELY TIGHT INDEED TO MAKE THE 
FINALS ANDREW HUNTER RIGHT AT THE 
TOP THIS IS WHERE THE BIG GUYS GET 
GOING HE HAS TO STICK WITH THESE 
GUYS NOW CASTRO IN THREE KENRICK 
MONK IN FOUR HUNTER IS STARTING TO 
GET TIRED TWO LEGS TO GO ANDREW HUNTER DROPPING TO THIRD AND 
FOURTH HE SEEMS TO HAVE SPENT ALL OF 
HIS ENERGY IN THE FIRST LAPSE 
CASTRO IS NOW GOING FORWARD WITH 
CLEAN WATER AND A HOLDING ON FOR 
THIRD ANDREW HUNTER HOLDING ON 
FOR THIRD CASTRO OF BRAZIL THAT IS 
OUT KENRICK MONK IT WILL BE 
EXTREMELY TIGHT TO GET INTO THIS 
FINAL I DO NOT THINK THAT WILL BE 
QUICK ENOUGH FOR ANDREW HUNTER ONE 
OF HEAT TO GO ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX CASTRO JUST TOUCHING OUT KENRICK 
MONK DAVID CARRY'S TIME IS STILL 
THE FASTEST OF THE LOT SO FAR IF THE LAST GUYS IN THIS HEAT GO 
ONE POINT FOUR FIVE THEN I THINK THAT WILL BE THE 
QUALIFYING TIME IT WILL BE VERY 
TIGHT FOR THE FINAL 
THOSE GUYS WERE RIGHT BECAUSE 
ANDREW HUNTER WAS NINTH EQUAL FASTEST 
WHICH MEANT THAT HE MISSED OUT ON A 
PLACE IN THE FINAL BY THIRTY ONE HUNDREDTHS 
OF A SECOND IT IS A BIG DEAL 
TONIGHT WERE DAVID CARRY 
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT HE IS IN THE 
RELAYS IN BEIJING L. THINK NOW HE 
IS PREPARING TO WIN THAT GOLD MEDAL 
THAT WILL BE THE FIRST OF THE 
FINALS THAT YOU WILL SEE LIVE 
TONIGHT AT SEVEN OH FIVE P. M. TONIGHT ON B. B. C. 
TWO THERE ARE OTHER RELAYS GOING 
ON THIS IS HOW THE BRITAIN'S MEN 
GOT ON IN THE FOUR TIMES ONE HUNDRED M. HEAT GREAT BRITAIN ARE IN A NUMBER THREE ROSS DAVENPORT IS LEADING OF GREAT BRITAIN RUSS DAVENPORT IS AFTER A 
RELATIVELY SLOW START 
IT IS A GOOD 
HEAT TO BE IN IT IS GOOD TO BE 
AMONG THE FAST SWIMMERS IN A RELAY 
HEAT OTHERWISE YOU CAN BE LULLED 
INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY 
DAVENPORT IS REALLY HAVING TO WORK 
HARD AGAINST THE WAVES A LOT OF 
SPLASHING NOW THE LANE LINES ARE 
SUPPOSED TO BE ANTI WAVES BUT 
THEY DO NOT DO A GREAT JOB 
DAVENPORT HAVING TO WORK VERY HARD 
HE IS LETTING THEM GET AWAY HERE THE AMERICANS WERE OUT EXTREMELY FAST INDEED DAVENPORT FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN NOT BAD FOR HIM HE 
HAD TO SWIM VERY CLOSE TO THE 
BRITISH RECORD JUST TO QUALIFY FOR 
THIS FINAL AUSTRALIA TWO CRAIG 
INNES IS DOING WELL FOR GREAT 
BRITAIN NOW HE NEEDS TO SWIM WELL 
AND DO HIS BEST IF HE CAN CRAIG 
GIVENS UNDER HIS BEST I THINK THE AMERICANS ARE MAKING 
SURE THERE IS A FAST QUALIFICATION 
FOR THE FINAL CRAIG GIBBINS HANDING OVER IN FIFTH 
U. S. A. IN ONE ALGERIA IN TWO 
AUSTRALIA THREE GREAT BRITAIN IN FIVE MATT PLAY FOR GREAT BRITAIN NOW A VERY GOOD SPRINTER PLAY HE MIGHT BE THIRD OR FOURTH BEN HOCK 
KIN IS THE FINAL SWIMMER FROM GREAT 
BRITAIN HE'S AN EXTREMELY WELL IN 
THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS ON THE 
LAST LEG OF THE MEDLEY RELAY HE 
SWAM EXTREMELY WELL 
MATT HAS DONE 
VERY WELL TO BRING THE TEAM UP TO 
EQUAL THIRD THEN HAVING TO TAKE ON A MASSIVE 
RESPONSIBILITY HERE IT IS DOWN TO 
THE FOURTH SWEAR AT AS TO WHETHER 
GREAT BRITAIN WILL QUALIFY IN THIS 
FINAL HAS U. S. A. LEADING HOLLAND IN SECOND 
GREAT BRITAIN IN THIRD AUSTRALIA 
PRETTY MUCH EQUAL WITH THEM WE 
REALLY HAVE TO GET THAT OZZY THE AMERICANS BEING BEATEN BY THE DUTCH IN LANE TWO IS IT A BRITISH RECORD IT COULD 
WELL BE THE TIME IS THREE MINUTES 
TWELVE POINT OH TWO JUST INSIDE THE BRITISH 
RECORD THEY NEEDED TO DO THAT JUST 
TO QUALIFY HOW WORLD SWIMMING HAS 
MOVED ON A VERY GOOD SWIM RYAN 
LOCHTE OR SWAM AT BREASTSTROKE AND 
NOW FRONT CRAWL IN THIS SESSION HE 
IS KNOWN AS A BACKSTROKE SWIMMER 
HOLLAND WON THE SECOND HEAT THE DUTCH TAKING THE RACE I THINK 
WE PROBABLY DID ENOUGH DO OH FIVE 
SECONDS UNDERNEATH THE BRITISH 
RECORD TO WIN FIVE L. 
THINK IT WILL BE ENOUGH A VERY GOOD SWIM IN THE MORNING I THINK THEY WILL QUALIFY WITH THAT 
IT MUST BE A ROUNDABOUT FIFTH OR SIXTH 
I WOULD GUESS SECOND HEAT 
CONFIRMATION GREAT BRITAIN WILL BE IN THE FINAL 
TONIGHT AND YOU CAN SEE THAT ON THE 
RED BUTTON ALSO ON THE RED BUTTON 
IF YOU HAVE AN INTERACTIVE 
TELEVISION YOU WILL SEE THE WOMEN 
IN THE FOURTH BY ONE HUNDRED M. RELAY AND I AM 
ADVISED BY THE EXPERTS THAT THEY 
COULD WIN THAT LET'S ROUND UP THE 
OTHER THINGS KATE HEYWOOD
