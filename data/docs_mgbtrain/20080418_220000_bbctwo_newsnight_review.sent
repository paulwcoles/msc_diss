THE REAL LIFE GADGETS AND SPIES 
WHICH INSPIRED IAN FLEMING'S BOND 
WHO ARE THE MYSTERIOUS MEN TRAPPED 
IN BRUGES 
I WILL TELL YOU TOMORROW 
NIGHT NIGHT ANNE SMITH FROM THE MONSTER'S POINT 
OF VIEW IN HARRISON BIRTWISTLE'S 
NEW OPERA AND MYTH 
JOINING ME JOURNALIST AND NOVELIST 
TONY PARSONS NOVELIST JULIE 
MYERSON AND WRITER AND CRITIC JOE 
QUEENAN QUEENAN IN RECENT YEARS MIKE LEIGH HAS NOT 
EXACTLY PLAYED IT FOR LAUGHS HIS 
LAST FILM WAS ABOUT AN ABORTIONIST 
BUT THE TITLE OF HIS NEW MOVIE 
HAPPY GO LUCKY IS NOT IRONIC HIS 
HEROINE POPPY IS RELENTLESSLY 
IRRITATINGLY CHIRPY THE ROLE WAS 
CREATED BY COLLABORATING WITH THE 
ACTRESS SALLY HAWKINS THE THEME 
OF OPTIMISM MAKES IT FEEL VERY 
DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MORE CYNICAL 
MIKE LEIGH COMEDIES LIKE NUTS IN 
MAY OR ABIGAIL'S PARTY POPPY IS A 
PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHER WHO 
MAINTAINS HER BARRAGE OF 
CHEERFULNESS EVEN DURING DRIVING 
LESSONS WITH THE PSYCHOTIC SCOTT 
PLAYED BY EDDIE MARSAN 
GET IN THE PASSENGER SEAT 
YOU KNOW 
IT IS ME LEARNING DON'T YOU YES YES WHAT WE HAVE TO TALK THINGS THROUGH 
FIRST 
IF YOU INSIST 
MAKE YOURSELF FIRST COMFORTABLE THIS YOUR CAR NO COMFORTABLE NO IT IS COMPANY CAR HAVE YOU GOT 
YOUR PROVISIONAL DRIVING LICENCE 
THAT IS ME ON A BAD DAY 
IS THAT 
YOUR REAL NAME 
THAT IS RIGHT 
EVERYTHING SEEMS IN ORDER HAVE YOU 
EVER HAD LESSON THERE FOR NOT NOT REALLY IT WAS A CADILLAC IN MIAMI 
I WAS PISSED IT WAS HILARIOUS 
HOW DIFFICULT TO DO YOU THINK IT IS 
TO CREATE AN INTERESTING CHARACTER 
FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS THIS HYPER 
HAPPY PERSONALITY 
THAT IS THE BIG 
QUESTION I HAVE HUGE RESPECT FOR 
MIKE LEIGH AND THE RISKS THAT HE 
TAKES THE THING ABOUT THIS FILM IS 
THAT IT HINGES ON WHAT YOU MAKE OF 
THIS GIRL'S CHARACTER FOR ME IT 
DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE I THINK 
WITHIN THE FILM THERE ARE TWO 
SUMMARIES OF THEIR CHARACTER HER 
FLATMATE SAYS SHE IS TOO NICE AND 
I THINK THAT IS WHAT MIKE LEIGH 
WANTS US TO THINK AND THE DRIVING 
INSTRUCTOR WHO WE SAW THEIR TELLS 
HER TOWARDS THE END OF THE FILM 
THAT SHE IS EGOCENTRIC ONLY THINGS 
ABOUT HERSELF AND SHE WANTS THAT 
WAS MY TAKE THROUGHOUT THE FILM L. 
THINK MIKE LEIGH IS CONFUSING 
HAPPINESS AND GOODNESS WITH GIGA 
LEANNESS NAIVETY AND YES SHE IS 
IRRITATING 
DID YOU SEE ANY IRRITATING COMPLEXITY IN THE CHARACTER 
SHE IS 
CLEARLY THE MOST IRRITATING 
CHARACTER IN THE HISTORY OF CINEMA 
SHE IS UNBELIEVABLY IRRITATING 
LIKE BARBARA WINDSOR ON PROZAC YOU 
SIT THERE FOR FIVE OR TEN MINUTES 
AND YOU THINK IT IS NOT GOING TO 
BE LIKE THIS ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
IS IT AND THEN YOU REALISE THAT 
CITIES I THINK THE PERFORMANCES 
ARE PARTIALLY RESCUED BY SALLY 
HAWKINS A LOVABLE ACTRESS YOU ARE 
KIND OF ON HER SIDE YOU ARE 
ROOTING FOR POPPY YOU WANT HER TO 
COME THROUGH BUT IT IS AN 
EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE L. CANNOT 
BELIEVE SHE DOES NOT GREAT ON 
EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD 
SHE DID WIN 
BEST ACTRESS IN BERLIN 
I DID NOT 
KNOW THE DRIVING INSTRUCTOR WAS A 
PSYCHOTIC UNTO YOU SAID THAT THAT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN MY REACTION TO HER 
BECAUSE SHE WAS SO MADDENING 
UNTIL YOU SAID THAT THERE IS ONE 
THING ABOUT IT L. THINK AT A 
CERTAIN POINT YOU JUST SAY WITH 
ALL THIS INSANITY AND CHIRPINESS 
AND HER INABILITY TO STOP I DID 
NOT WANT ANYTHING BAD TO HAPPEN TO 
HER THERE WERE A COUPLE OF POINTS 
WHEN SHE GOT VERY CLOSE TO THE 
ABYSS I DON'T THINK SHE WAS AWARE 
THAT IT EXISTED L. JUST DID NOT 
WANT TO SEE HER FALL INTO THAT SO 
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT HER THAT 
LIKE YOU SAID THAT KIND OF REDEEMS 
HER BENEATH IF YOU COULD JUST 
GIVE HER SOME MEDICINE 
THERE IS AN 
UNDERLYING MORAL IMPERATIVE WHICH 
IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MIKE LEIGH 
FILMS WHICH IS THE IDEA THAT 
OPTIMISM IS THE RIGHT PATH IN LIFE 
VERE DRAKE WAS OPTIMISTIC AND GOOD 
AND ALSO HAPPY UNTIL SHE GOT INTO 
TROUBLE THE TROUBLE WITH THIS FILM 
IS THAT HE DOES NOT TEST HER SHE 
COMES UP AGAINST TINY PROBLEMS AND 
THEY RESOLVE ALMOST INSTANTLY IN 
THE SCENE WHERE SHE HAS TO DEAL 
WITH CHILD AT SCHOOL WHO HAS 
BECOME VIOLENT IT ALL GETS 
RESOLVED SO EASILY L. WOULD HAVE 
LIKED TO SEE HER REMAIN HAPPY 
HAVING THE NEXT DIFFICULT 
CONVERSATION WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN 
WITH THE PARENTS OF THAT BOY BUT 
SHE NEVER DOES 
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT 
THAT THE STUFF OF SHE GOES AND 
SHE MEETS THIS BAG PERSON AT A 
CERTAIN POINT L. THOUGHT THAT WAS 
THE PART WHERE MIKE LEIGH SAID I 
HAVE TO PUT HER IN A SITUATION OF 
DANGER THAT MADE NO SENSE TO ME 
NO WOMAN IN HER RIGHT MIND WOULD 
HAVE GONE THERE 
SHE IS ACTUALLY 
LIKE A MIDDLE CLASS LIBERAL MALES 
I THINK THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM YOU 
THINK SHE MUST HAVE SOME SELF 
DEFENCE MECHANISMS THAT WOULD STOP 
HER GOING TO A DISUSED WAREHOUSE 
WITH SOME GIBBERING ALCOHOLIC TRAMP 
A LOT OF HER RESPONSES THERE IS 
ONE POINT WHERE SHE IS ON A DRIVING 
LESSON AND THE DRIVING INSTRUCTOR 
IS A RACIST SO WHEN A COUPLE OF 
BLACK TEENAGE KIDS GO PAST HE SAYS 
LOCK THE DOOR SHE ACTS AS THOUGH 
SHE CANNOT EVEN CONTEMPLATE THAT HE 
WOULD BE THREATENED IT DOES NOT 
MAKE HER A RACIST IF SHE DOES NOT 
ACT LIKE THAT IF SHE SAYS TONE IT 
DOWN A BIT HE MAKES FILMS ABOUT 
THE WORKING CLASS BUT HE IMPOSES 
MIDDLE CLASS LIBERAL MALE VALUES 
ON IT AND I CRINGE WHEN I SEE 
THESE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE GOING 
ALL RIGHT DARLING L. KNOW HE IS 
MEANT TO LOVE THE WORKING CLASS BUT 
TO ME IT IS UNBELIEVABLY 
PATRONISING 
CLASS COMES TO PLAY IN PATRONISING THE SCENE WHERE SHE VISITS HER 
SISTER IT BECOMES LIKE EARLY MIKE 
LEIGH WITH THE MOCKERY OF LOWER 
MIDDLE CLASS WHICH WAS MORE 
GENUINELY FUNNY THAN A LOT ELSE IN 
THE FILM 
I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING 
THAT TONY SAYS AND I AM BAFFLED BY 
THIS FILM HE PUTS HER IN THE CAR 
WITH HIS DRIVING INSTRUCTOR AND 
WHILE HE IS TRYING TO TEACH HER 
SHE IS USING SEXUAL INNUENDO TO 
STOP HIM TEACHING HER L. THINK THAT 
MIKE LEIGH WANTS US TO THINK ISN'T 
SHE FUNNY AND GREAT L. DID NOT FEEL 
THAT WAY ABOUT IT L. AM BAFFLED BY 
THE FILM 
YOU FELT SHE WAS REDEEMED 
TOWARDS THE END 
I ENJOYED THE 
MOVIE I THINK I ENJOYED IT BECAUSE 
IT WAS NOT LIKE OTHER MIKE LEIGH 
MOVIES THERE ARE THINGS THAT WERE 
HILARIOUS I THOUGHT THE DRIVING 
INSTRUCTOR STUFF WAS GREAT L. 
THOUGHT THE STUFF WHERE SHE WENT TO 
TAKE FLAMENCO DANCING WAS HILARIOUS 
THERE IS GREAT SCENE WHERE SHE IS 
LEARNING FLAMENCO FUNNILY ENOUGH 
IT IS THE ONE SCENE WHERE NOBODY IS 
JIGGLING GIBBERING LAUGHING AND 
CHORTLING IT IS VERY SERIOUS SHE 
STARTS TALKING ABOUT HER EX 
BOYFRIEND WHO HAS RUN OFF WITH A 
TWENTY YEAR OLD SWEDISH AU PAIR 
CLASSIC COMEDY 
HAPPY GO LUCKY IS ON GENERAL 
RELEASE AND A COLLECTION OF MIKE 
LEIGH'S FILMS HAS JUST BEEN 
RELEASED ON D. V. D. 
THE AUGUST HALLS OF THE IMPERIAL 
WAR MUSEUM ARE MORE USED TO 
DISPLAYING SPITFIRES THAN THE 
LITTLE NELLY HELICOPTER FROM YOU 
ONLY LIVE TWICE BUT TO MARK THE 
ONE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF IAN FLEMING'S 
BIRTH SPECIAL EXHIBITION FOR 
YOUR EYES ONLY HAS BEEN MOUNTED 
THROUGH WARTIME DOCUMENTS PRIVATE 
LETTERS FILM POSTERS AND DANIEL 
CRAIG'S BLOOD SPATTERED TURNBULL 
AND ASSER SHIRT IT TELLS THE STORY 
OF BRITAIN'S MOST FAMOUS SECRET 
AGENT 
IAN FLEMING IN CREATING JAMES 
BOURNE DREW SO MUCH ON HIS 
EXPERIENCES AS PERSONAL ASSISTANT 
TO THE HEAD OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE 
THROUGHOUT THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
JAMES BOND ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT 
DID PREVENT HIM FROM SEEING MORE 
ACTIVE SERVICE WAS THE FACT THAT HE 
KNEW TOO MUCH THE SPECIAL 
OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE THE 
SPECIALISTS IN DEVISING LOTS OF 
SECRET WEAPONS INCLUDING EXPLODING 
COWPATS AND EXPLODING RATS 
MINIATURE CAMERAS MINIATURE GUNS 
AND IAN FLEMING USES THEM IN THE 
NOVELS FLEMING WAS VERY MUCH AWARE 
OF BRITAIN'S DECLINING STATUS IN 
THE WORLD BUT IN THE NOVELS OF 
COURSE JAMES BOND IS STILL BATTING 
FOR BRITAIN AND REALLY PUNCHING 
ABOVE BRITAIN'S STRENGTH SO THERE 
MUST HAVE BEEN AN APPEAL IF WE 
COULD NOT WIN THE COLD WAR IN 
REALITY WE WERE WINNING IT IN THE 
FICTION OF IAN FLEMING 
CURATED WITH A LITTLE TOUCH OF Q. 
IS THIS EXHIBITION MORE ABOUT JAMES 
BOND OR IAN FLEMING 
IT IS 
DEFINITELY AN EXHIBITION ABOUT THE 
END FLEMING AND IT MEASURES THE GAP 
BETWEEN IAN FLEMING AND JAMES BOND 
THEY SHARED AN AWFUL LOT FROM 
SNOBBERY AND HEAD AND HIS SON THE 
SAME BRAND OF CIGARETTES AND THERE 
WERE AREAS WHERE THEY WERE 
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAT IS THE 
HYPOTHETICAL NATURE OF FICTION HIS 
FATHER WAS A WAR HERO KILLED ON 
THE WESTERN FRONT AND HE WAS A 
DESK BOUND SOLDIER YOU CAN FEEL 
THAT WISH FULFILMENT COMING THROUGH 
IN THE BOOK L. THOUGHT IT WAS AN 
EXTRAORDINARY EXHIBITION IT IS IN 
A TIGHT SPACE AND THERE IS NOT MUCH 
THERE BUT IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE AN 
ELEVEN YEAR OLD KID IN THE SIXTIES 
DISCOVERING THE BOOKS FOR THE VERY 
FIRST TIME THERE WERE MILLIONS OF 
US MILLIONS OF US AND THINKING 
IAN FLEMING REALLY KNOWS ABOUT 
CASINOS AND EXOTIC SEX AND 
AEROPLANES AND FOOD AND DRINK WE 
KNEW ABOUT NONE 
OF THIS STUFF LOTS LOTS OF IT CAME FROM HIS DESK BOUND JOB 
AND THEIR OTHER DESKS IN THE 
EXHIBITION WHICH GIVE AN IN DEPTH 
LOOK AT MADE SURE INTELLIGENCE 
AT A NAVAL INTELLIGENCE 
HE WAS 
UPSTAGED BY BASIL RATHBONES ARTHUR 
CONAN DOYLE WAS L. FELT THAT WAY IN 
THE EXHIBIT BECAUSE IT IS NOT THAT 
FAR REMOVED IN TIME IT IS NOT LIKE 
READING SOCRATES IT WAS FORTY YEARS 
AGO THE OTHER THING I WENT 
THROUGH THE EXHIBIT AND THE FIRST 
TIME I FELT A JOLT WAS WHEN I SAW 
THE FIRST PHOTO OF SEAN CONNERY 
THERE IS A SCENE WHEN SEAN CONNERY 
IS SHAKING HANDS WITH IAN FLEMING 
AND SEAN CONNERY IS NOT A PUBLIC 
SCHOOLBOY THE LOOK TO ME WAS YOU 
MAY HAVE CREATED JAMES BOND BUT I 
AM JAMES BOURNE HE WAS THE ONE 
THING THAT DID NOT LOOK DATED SEAN 
CONNERY JAMES BOND 
THERE IS 
PATHOS IN THOSE PHOTOS OF CONNERY 
AND IAN FLEMING THE BOOKS HAD BEEN 
OUT FOR TEN YEARS BUT THEY BECAME 
BESTSELLERS AFTER THE FILMS IAN 
FLEMING WAS ON HIS WAY OUT SICK 
BY THE TIME THE EARLY FILMS CAME 
OUT THERE IS PATHOS IN THE 
PHOTOGRAPHS PHOTOGRAPHS WE DID GET A SENSE OF IAN FLEMING 
AS A WRITER 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A 
FASCINATING PORTRAYAL OF A WRITER 
THE BEST THING ABOUT IT FOR ME WAS 
THAT THERE WERE LOTS OF LETTERS 
FROM HIM AND TO HIM LOOKS TO READ 
IT IS NOT FOR KIDS BECAUSE THE IAN 
FLEMING STUFF IS WELL DONE BUT IT 
IS QUITE GROWN UP AND THE JAMES 
BOND PART IS NOT VERY SCINTILLATING 
THERE IS NOT MUCH TO LOOK AT AND IT 
IS NOT VERY EXCITING 
IT IS AN 
EXHIBITION ABOUT FLEMING 
THERE IS 
INCREDIBLE FOOTAGE OF HIM IN HIS 
SAFARI JACKET WITH HIS CIGARETTE 
HOLDER AND HIS IF 
YOU GOING EXPECTING ROGER MOORE AND 
DAVID CRAIG YOU WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE IT IS NOT 
ABOUT THE FILMS 
THAT WAS THE ONE 
GREAT THING ABOUT THE EXHIBIT 
THERE WAS NO ROGER MOORE SOMEONE 
WENT IN AND SAID JAMES BOND IS SEAN 
CONNERY THE KIDS LIKE PIERCE 
BROSNAN AND DANIEL CRAIG TIMOTHY 
DALTON IS FINE BUT DO NOT PUT UP 
TOO MANY PHOTOS OF ROGER MOORE 
BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THEY WENT 
WRONG FOR TWENTY YEARS 
THERE IS 
ACTUALLY NOT A LOT OF JAMES BOND IN 
IT TO A LARGE PART OF THE WORLD 
THAT 
IS WHAT THEY THINK OF THERE THERE IS ROSA KLEBB'S SHOE WITH THE 
KNIFE IN IT AND THE GOLDEN GUN 
THERE ARE IF YOU GADGETS 
IT IS A 
HOMELY EXHIBITION 
IT IS FOR PEOPLE 
WHO LOVE THE BOOKS J. F. K. WOULD HAVE 
LOVED THIS EXHIBITION 
WHY DO YOU 
THINK JAMES BOND IS STILL SO 
POPULAR WHY IS THE IMPERIAL WAR 
MUSEUM ABLE TO MOUNT THIS 
EXHIBITION 
HE IS THE ULTIMATE EXHIBITION ACTION HERO ALL THE REST OF THEM 
ARE STARTING TO TRYING TO START 
FRANCHISES LIKE MATT DAMON IN THE 
PORN FILMS HE IS THE ELVIS OF 
ACTION HEROES 
A LOT OF THAT COMES FROM IAN 
FLEMING'S PERSONAL HISTORY 
DO YOU 
THINK JAMES 
BOND ENSURES JAMES JAMES BOND IS FANTASTIC BECAUSE HE CAN 
KILL PEOPLE AND SPEAK FRENCH THAT 
IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT HE WAS 
PARTICULARLY SEAN CONNERY WHO IAN 
FLEMING DID NOT WANT TO PLAY JAMES 
BOND HE IS A WORKING CLASS GUY WHO 
HAS ALL THIS SOPHISTICATION HE 
KNOWS WHAT CLOTHES TO WEAR CAN 
SPEAK FOREIGN LANGUAGES WHEN I WAS 
A KID EVERYBODY WANTED TO BE JAMES 
BOND EVEN THE FAT KIDS 
FOR YOUR EYES ONLY IAN FLEMING 
AND JAMES BOND IS AT THE IMPERIAL 
WAR MUSEUM IN LONDON UNTIL MARCH 
NEXT YEAR 
MARTIN MCDONAGH IS MASTER OF 
MACABRE COMEDY IS I WILL NEVER 
FORGET LAUGHING OUT LOUD DURING 
SCENES OF TORTURE IN THE PILLOW MAN 
ANOTHER OF HIS PLAYS SPARKED THE 
HEADLINE SIX BUCKETS NEEDED IN THE 
STALLS AFTER AUDIENCE MEMBERS 
REPORTEDLY THREW UP SICK BUCKETS 
HIS FILM IN BRUGES IS ALSO 
CHARACTERISTICALLY VIOLENT AN 
EARLIER FORAY INTO CINEMA EARNED 
HIM AN OSCAR FOR HIS SHORT FILM SIX 
SHOOTER IN BRUGES FEATURES TWO 
IRISHMAN SENT TO BELGIUM AFTER 
JOB GOES WRONG WHILE THEY WAIT FOR 
INSTRUCTIONS FROM THEIR BOSS THEY 
ARE LEFT TO GO SIGHTSEEING IN THE 
HISTORIC CITY 
I THOUGHT YOU DID 
NOT LIKE BRUGES 
I DO NOT BUT I 
DID ALREADY SAY THAT I HAD A DATE 
WITH A BELGIAN LADY L. DID ALREADY 
SAY BEFORE 
JUST DON'T GET INTO ANY 
TROUBLE WE'RE KEEPING A LOW 
PROFILE AND THIS MORNING AND 
THIS AFTERNOON WE ARE DOING WHAT I 
WANT TO DO GOT IT 
OF COURSE 
WHICH I PRESUME WILL INVOLVE 
CULTURE 
WE SHALL STRIKE A BALANCE CULTURE BETWEEN CULTURE AND FUN 
SOMEHOW I 
THINK THE BALANCE WILL TIP IN THE 
FAITH IN THE FAVOUR OF CULTURE 
MARTIN MCDONAGH HOW DO YOU THINK 
HE MANAGES THE TRANSITION INTO HIS 
FULL FULL FIRST FULL LENGTH FILM 
ABOUT MINUTES INTO THE MOVIE YOU 
FIND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT THE MEN 
THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO 
SYMPATHISE WITH THEM THAT ASIDE 
IT'S REALLY FUNNY I THOUGHT TO 
MYSELF I WISH HE HAD NOT SHOWED ME 
THAT THE REST OF THE MOVIE WAS 
FUNNY THE ACTORS ARE GREAT COLIN 
FARRELL IT'S GREAT TO SEE FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT 
HIM MAKING GOOD MOVIE AND 
UNDERSTAND HIM AGAIN AND BRENDAN 
GLEESON WAS GREAT ALL THE TIME I 
THOUGHT I WONDER HOW HE WILL FIX 
THIS HE COULD NOT FIX IT I I DISAGREE I THINK THAT'S THE 
STRENGTH OF THE FILM YOU THINK IT 
WILL BE A FILM ABOUT TWO LOVABLE 
ROGZ YOU THINK HERE WE GO BEEN 
HERE BEFORE HE TAKES IT A STAGE 
FURTHER TWENTY MINUTES INTO THE FILM 
MAYBE AT THE POINT YOU'RE TALKING 
ABOUT I THOUGHT THIS FILM IS 
STARTLING ME IT'S TAKING MASSIVE 
RISKS SOMEHOW IT'S GETTING AWAY IT 
IT PUSHES THE BOUNDARIES OF TASTE 
I THOUGHT I'M GOING TO LOVE THIS 
WHATEVER IT DOES HE KNOWS WHAT 
HE'S DOING SENSATIONAL THE THE THE THE KEY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO 
HIT MEN WE SAW A SENSE OF IT 
ALMOST LIKE FATHER SON AT SOME 
POINTS 
I THOUGHT COLIN FARRELL WAS POINTS TERRIFIC AND BRENDAN GLEESON HAS 
THE ABILITY TO GO FROM BENIGN 
TOURIST ISN'T IT SO LOVELY THE 
MOST MED EVIL VILLAGE IN THIS PART 
OF BELGIUM YET WHEN FARRELL PUSHES 
HIM TOO FAR WHEN HE GETS DRUNK 
AND DRAWS ATTENTION TO THEM A 
CLOUD COMES OVER HIS FACE AND IN 
AN INSTANT YOU BELIEVE HE YOU 
BELIEVE HE'S A HIT MAN L. THINK 
IT'S A TERRIFIC FILM IT CONFOUND 
EXPECTATIONS ONE OF THE THINGS I 
THOUGHT IT HAD GOING FOR IT YOU 
THINK IT KNOWS WHERE IT'S GOING AND 
YOU PULL A STUNT IT LEAVES A LOT 
UNEXPLAINED WHY DOES THIS ESSEX 
HIT MAN WANT A PRIEST KILLED YOU 
CAN FILL IN THE GAPS YOURSELF WHY 
ARE THE IRISH HITMEN IN LONDON 
PLYING THEIR TRADE IN LONDON WHY 
HAS FARRELL HAVE A STRANGE 
EVERYWHERE THINK WITH THE VEET 
KNEES WHEN HE'S TAKING COKE AND 
HE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT WAR HE 
WANTS TO KNOW WHICH SIDE WILL THE 
VET MEEZ BE ON 
YOU BELIEVE IN THE 
VIOLENCE AND ALSO BELIEVE IN 
REMORSE 
THERE ARE NO SECOND CHANCE REMORSE ON CERTAIN THINGS THERE'S CERTAIN 
AT THAT BOOZE U. YOU DON'T GO BEYOND 
THE END OF THE MOVIE NOW I 
UNDERSTAND WHY THERE'S NO SECOND 
CHANCE THERE'S TABOOS THAT YOU 
DON'T GO BEYOND HINT HINT TO ME 
SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE SAID KILL THE 
PRIEST DON'T KILL THE ARE ARE TABOOS BROKEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE 
HUMOUR DID IT GO TOO FAR 
IT GOES 
TOO FAR AND GETS AWAY WITH IT 
THAT'S SO CLEVER ABOUT IT THERE'S 
A SCENE IN A RESTAURANT WHERE A 
COUPLE TELL HIM OFF FOR SMOKING 
AND HE PUNCH THE MAN HE CLEARLY IS 
THE TYPE WHO WOULD PROBABLY PUNCH 
THE MAN THAT'S QUITE FUNNY HE 
PUNCHES THE WOMEN L. WAS SIMPLY 
SHOCKED YOU DON'T SEE IT IN FILMS 
LIKE THIS IT IS WHAT HE WOULD DO 
IT'S INCREDIBLY ANTI AMERICAN I'VE 
NEVER SEEN A BRITISH FILM THAT 
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT CRACKING THE 
STATES YOU HAVE FAT AMERICANS AND 
LOUD AMERICANS 
THEY ARE MAKING A 
GOOD POINT THEY ARE CANADIAN BUT BUT THEY ARE CANADIAN 
THERE'S LOTS OF 
ANTI AMERICAN JIBES 
WE DON'T CARE 
THE BELGIANS PROBABLY DO IT'S 
NASTY TO BELGIANS FROM THE THING 
ABOUT PUNCHING THE WOMEN TO ME 
THAT'S A TABOO PEOPLE DO IT ALL 
THE TIME IN MOVIES 
I HAVEN'T SEEN 
IT BEFORE THE THINK THE FILM HAS A 
STRONG SENSE OF ITS OWN MORALITY 
AND THAT IS WHY HE DESERVES A 
SECOND CHANCE 
THERE'S A CODE OF 
HONOUR ALMOST TO THE POINT OF 
SURREALNESS THAT THEY PERSIST AND AND THE RALPH FIENNES CHARACTER IS 
ABOUT HONOUR THERE ARE POINTS IN 
IN CLIMAX OF THE MOVIE WHERE THE 
LAND LADY IS TRYING THIS IS THE 
SHOOT OUT THIS IS ALMOST TARANTINO 
SELF KRBNESS 
WE CAN SEE THE SCENE SELF KRBNESS NOW 
I'VE GOT ON IDEA 
MY ROOM NOW FACES ON TO THE CANAL I'LL GO BACK 
TO ME ROOM JUMP INTO THE CANAL 
AND SEE IF I CAN SWIM TO THE OTHER 
SIDE AND ESCAPE IF YOU GO OUTSIDE 
TO THE CORNER YOU CAN SHOOT AT ME 
AND TRY AND GET ME THAT WAY WE CAN 
LEAVE THE LADY AND HER BABY YOU YOU COMPLETELY PROMISE TO JUMP IN THE 
CANAL 
I GO OUTSIDE I COMPLETELY PROMISE 
YOU GO RIGHT IT IS A PROMISE BIG CANAL 
ALL RIGHT L. JUST GOT HERE 
RALPH FIENNES DO YOU THINK HE HERE PULLS IT OFF 
MADE TO BE EVIL HE 
HAS EVIL EYES HE HAS A FLAT AFFECT 
I THINK HE'S GREAT WE HAVEN'T 
HEARD FROM THE DEVAMP COMMUNITY WE 
ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS TABOO AND 
THIS TABOO L. DON'T KNOW WHAT 
DWARFS WILL THINK 
I SAW THE 
TRAILER 
ON THE STREETS OF TRAILER BRUGES STARRING A DWARF 
HE'S AS 
MUCH A CHARACTER AS ANYBODY ELSE 
HE'S NOT A TOKEN FIGURE TO LAUGH AT 
I WOULD LIKE TO GET INPUT FROM THE 
DWARF COMMUNITY 
IN BRUGES IN 
CINEMAS AROUND THE COUNTRY THE 
MYTH ITSELF IS AT LEAST THREE THOUSAND YEARS 
OLD THE MONSTROUS MINOTAUR HALF 
BULL HALF MAN IMPRISONED IN A 
LABYRINTH DEVOURING HUMAN HOSTAGES 
IT HAS FASCINATED ARTISTS THROUGH 
THE CENTURIES FROM HOMER TO PICASSO 
AND BORGES 
NOW HARRISON BIRTWISTLE OFTEN 
DESCRIBED AS BRITAIN'S GREATEST 
LIVING COMPOSER HAS CREATED HIS 
OWN VERSION FOR THE ROYAL OPERA 
THE LIBRETTO IS BY POET DAVID 
HARSENT WITH WHOM HE HAS 
COLLABORATED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS 
INCLUDING THEIR LAST OPERA FOR 
COVENT GARDEN GAWAIN 
THE ROLE OF THE MINOTAUR WAS 
SPECIALLY CREATED TO SUIT THE VOICE 
OF JOHN TOMLINSON 
ARIADNE PLAYED BY CHRISTINE RICE 
IS FIRST SEEN ON A LONELY BEACH 
PREFIGURING HER LATER ABANDONMENT 
BY THESEUS 
IT'S THROUGH MUSIC THAT YOU CAN 
DEAL IN MYTH IN A VERY PARTICULAR 
WAY 
WHEN WAY TAKE A SUBJECT LIKE WAY THE MINOTAUR OR YOU TAKE A SUBJECT 
LIKE ORPHEUS THERE'S THE UNKNOWN 
QUALITY THE COMING IN OFF THE 
STREET THERE'S A DEGREE OF 
FOREKNOWLEDGE AND SO IT IS A 
QUESTION OF FINDING A LANGUAGE FOR 
THAT AND A FORM 
PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THEY CAN SEE THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BEASTIAL 
SIDE AND THE HUMAN SIDE IN FACT 
THEY ARE INEXTRICABLY JOINED ONE 
IS NOT NECESSARILY THE VIRTUES AND 
THE OTHER YOU KNOW THE TERRIFYING 
TERRIBLE I THINK I SEE THE 
MINOTAUR AS BEING THE ONLY TRUE 
INNOCENT IN THE PEACE THE FIRST 
SIGHT OF HIM IS THIS STARK TRAGIC 
FIGURE 
THE RECEIVED INFORMATION FIGURE FOR THE MINOTAUR IS THE ANIMAL YOU 
LOOK AT THE TOP HALF YOU DON'T 
LOOK AT THE BOTTOM HALF IT IS 
YOU THINK BULL 
HARRISON BIRTWISTLE AN IMPRESSIVE 
EVENT WHAT DID YOU THINK I I THOUGHT THE MINUTE MACHINE MINOTAUR 
LOOKED LIKE ONE OF THE RUNNERS IN 
THE LONDON MARATHON PEOPLE WHO 
DRESS UP LIKE CAMELS AND CHICKENS 
I REALLY ENJOYED IT DRAMATICALLY L. 
THOUGHT IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE PIECE 
OF THEATRE L. LOVED IT HAS TWO 
MOODS BLEAK DESPAIR AND SCREAMING 
TERROR SUCH A POWERFUL MYTH AND A 
SUCH A BRILLIANT STORY REALLY 
WELL DONE THE INNOCENCE ON THE 
BAEMP WAITING TO BE FED TO THE 
BEAST THE BLACK SELVES OF DEATH L. 
REALLY ENJOYED IT L. STRUGGLED WITH 
THE MUSIC FOR THREE HOURS I REALLY 
ENJOYED IT L. REMEMBER MY FATHER 
HOLDING THE COVER OF THE FIRST NEW 
YORK DOLLS ALBUM AND REALLY 
WANTING TO GET TO IT SAYING IT'S 
NOT MUSIC IS IT BRITAIN'S 
GREATEST LIVING COMPOSER I DON'T 
REMEMBER ANY OF IT 
DID YOU FIND 
THE MUSIC A BARRIER 
NO L. THINK IF 
I HAD JUST A MUSIC ON ITS OWN I ONE 
OF LOVED IT FOR ME THE SINGING 
INTERRUPTED IT L. DON'T HAVE A EAR 
TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE MUSIC WENT TO 
THE MUSIC L. THOUGHT IT WAS WELL 
DONE THERE WERE LOTS OF THINGS I 
LIKED IT WAS BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED 
BY ALISON CHITTY THE SEE THAT YOU 
SEE LOOKING WRONG POWERFUL AND 
LEADEN BUT I WASN'T ENJOYING 
MYSELF I WAS WAITING FOR IT TO END 
WHAT ABOUT THE INTERPRETATION OF 
THE MYTH FOCUSSING ON THE MORE 
HUMAN SIDE OF THE MINOTAUR THAN 
THE BULL THE SENSERS DREAMING AS A 
MAN AND DIDN'T HAVE SENSE HE 
WAS DREAMING A MAN 
THE STORY 
YOU HAVE OF BEOWULF FRANKENSTEIN'S 
BUT LOOKING AT IT FROM THE POINT OF 
VIEW OF THE MONSTER AT THE END OF 
THE THING THE EIGHT HARPIES COME 
OUT THEY HAVE THEIR FACED SNEARED 
IN BLOOD AND THEY HAVE BEEN EATING 
THE HEARTS OF VICTIMS AND THE 
MANAGERS ARE GIVING THEM FLOWERS 
AND EVERYBODY IS SAYING BRAVO AND 
BRAVO THE SAME PERSON AT THE 
INTERMISSION DESCRIBING IT AS THE 
CHAIN SAW TEXAS MASSACRE THEY ARE 
AFRAID TO SAY IT'S HORRIBLE I I AGREE I DON'T I DON'T GET THE 
MUSIC I REALLY WOULD LOVE TO BE 
ABLE TO APPRECIATE IT AND I DON'T 
I AGREE WITH JOE I THINK IT'S A 
BIT OF A CONTRICK BEING PERPETRATED 
IS THAT FAIR BIT OF BIT OF 
HARRISON BIRTWISTLE TALKS ABOUT IT 
HE TALKS ABOUT THE SAXOPHONE BEING 
A. R. ARIADNE INSTRUMENT IT COMES IN 
AS THE EXACT RANGE OF HER VOICE 
THERE'S A CLEVERNESS 
YOU DON'T 
NEED ANYBODY TO EXPLAIN GUYS AND 
SCAN CALLS TO YOU 
DOES EVERYTHING 
HAVE TO BE AS EASY AS THAT 
NO BUT 
WHY SHOULD LOVING MUSIC BE A 
STRUGGLE 
YOU HAVE TO WORK AT THIS STRUGGLE BUT WHY CAN'T THEY LEARN TO SING 
SO WE CAN HEAR THE SING AND NOT 
HAVE THE SURTITLES THERE 
AND WHAT 
ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF WHETHER WE 
HEAR HIM HALF ROARING 
THE SINGERS 
ARE GREAT THE SINGERS HAVE TO 
PERFORM AT THE END I ALWAYS 
APPLAUD FOR THE PEOPLE THEY HAVE 
WORKED SO HARD I'VE BEEN GOING TO 
THE OPERA SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT I'M TIRED OF 
IT THIS ISN'T NEW MUSIC THIS IS 
NEW MUSIC THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON
