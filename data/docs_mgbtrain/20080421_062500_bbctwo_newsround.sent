HI THERE BRITAIN'S HONEY BEES ARE 
IN DANGER THAT IS THE WARNING FROM 
EXPERT WHO SAY THE INSECTS COULD 
DIE OUT IN TEN YEARS BEES DO A LOT 
MORE THAN JUST MAKE HONEY THAT IS 
WHY USING THESE LITTLE CREATURES IS 
SUCH A BIG DEAL LOSING THEY 
LIVE IN GROUPS CALLED COLONIES 
BEEKEEPERS IN BRITAIN SAY LOADS OF 
THESE COLONIES ARE DYING BECAUSE 
THE HONEY BEES ARE GETTING SICK 
MOST OF THEM COULD BE WIPED OUT IN 
TEN YEARS IF SOMETHING IS NOT DONE 
WHY ABBEY'S SO IMPORTANT IT IS NOT 
ONLY THE ARMY THEY FLY OUT TO ALL 
THE FLOWERS ON THE PLANTS WE NEED 
FOR FOOD IF THEY DO NOT POLLINATE 
THOSE FLOWERS AND NOTHING HAPPENS 
LATER YOU GET NO FOOD WITHOUT 
BEES WE WOULD HAVE NO FRUIT AND 
VEG WE WOULD NOT IMAGINE A WORLD 
IN WHICH WE COULD ONLY EAT POTATOES 
AND BREAD YOU MUST BE UPSET SO 
MANY ARE DYING DO YOU KNOW Y.

DISEASES THEY ARE GETTING BUT WE DO 
NOT KNOW WHY THEY ARE GETTING MORE

GOVERNMENT WE WANT THE GOVERNMENT
