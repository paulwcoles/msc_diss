WE WILL UNDERGROUND TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT EFFECT IT HAS 
HAD ON THEM IN THE COMING DAYS TWENTY 
YEARS OF INCEST AND NO DAYLIGHT IT

WOMAN WILL EVER GET HEALTHY AGAIN 
WHAT HAS SHOCKED AUSTRIANS ABOUT 
THIS CASE IS NOT ONLY THE HORRIFIC 
DETAIL OF WHAT IS ALLEGED TO HAVE 
TAKEN PLACE INSIDE THIS HOUSE IT'S 
ALSO THE REALISATION THAT FOR TWENTY FOUR 
YEARS NO ONE AND THIS TOWN ON THE 
STREET APPEAR TO KNOW WHAT WAS 
HAPPENING IN THIS TOWN 
AMSTETTEN IS STRUGGLING TO COME TO 
TERMS WITH THE NEWS 
I THINK IT'S 
WOBBLE THE THOUGHT IT IS HAPPENING 
DOWN THE STREET IS SHOCKING IT 
IS HORRIBLE L. DID NOT KNOW THE 
FAMILY I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYONE 
GOING IN OR OUT 
ONE HOUSE WITH 
ITS TERRIFYING SECRET HAS CAST A 
SHADOW OVER A WHOLE COUNTRY 
THERE IS JUST ONE QUESTION BEING 
ASKED OVER AND OVER AGAIN HOW 
COULD ANY FATHER DO THIS TO HIS OWN 
DAUGHTER OUR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT 
REPORTS REPORTS THIS IS THE FACE OF A MONSTER TO 
THE OUTSIDE WORLD JOSEPH FRITZEL 
PRESENTED THE IMAGE OF A CARING 
FATHER AT HOME HE WAS AN EVIL 
TYRANT WHOSE APPALLING CRIMES WENT

THE BASEMENT EARLIER THIS MONTH 
SHE BECAME SERIOUSLY ILL AND WAS 
ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL FINALLY HE 
RELEASED HER ELIZABETH NOW AGED FORTY TWO 
AND THE TWO OTHER IMPRISONED 
CHILDREN 
AS R. AS I KNOW THIS CHILDREN CASE IS TOTALLY UNPRECEDENTED YOU 
GET ABDUCTION RAPE AND INCEST BUT 
SELDOM ALL THREE TOGETHER IN SUCH 
PROPORTION HE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN 
ABSOLUTE CONTROL FREAK WHAT IS 
COMMONLY CALLED A PSYCHOPATH WITH 
NO EMPATHY OR CONSIDERATION FOR 
OTHER PEOPLE'S FEELINGS AT ALL 
ONLY CONCERNED WITH HIS OWN AGENDA 
THIS AFTERNOON THE POLICE SAID THE 
TWO BOYS AGED EIGHTEEN AND FIVE HELD IN 
THE CELLAR ALL THEIR LIVES WERE 
NOW SLOWLY COMING TO TERMS WITH 
LIFE ON THE OUTSIDE 
I 
VISITED MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY 
DURING THIS VISIT I COULD SEE THAT 
THE FIVE YEAR OLD BOY IS IN A 
BETTER CONDITION HE EVEN TOLD ME 
HOW HAPPY HE WAS AND HOW FANTASTIC 
IT WAS TO RIDE IN A REAL CAR THIS THIS CASE HAS CHILLING ECHOES OF ANOTHER 
ABDUCTION IN AUSTRIA NATASHA WAS 
SNATCHED OFF THE STREET ON HER WAY 
TO SCHOOL AND KEPT FOR EIGHT YEARS 
IN A CELLAR BY A PAEDOPHILE SHE

NOW BE LOCKED UP FOR GOOD 
LET'S GET THE LATEST FROM STEVE 
ROSENBERG OUTSIDE THE HOUSE IN 
AMSTETTEN I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO 
SOUND LIKE A CLICHE BUT I IMAGINE 
ALL AUSTRIA MUST BE IN SHOCK YES YES GEORGE TOTAL SHOCK AND THAT SHOCK 
BEGINS HERE IN AMSTETTEN ALL DAY 
RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN COMING TO THE 
STREETS STANDING HERE WATCHING 
WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING JUST 
LOOKING AT THE HOUSE IN DISBELIEF 
PEOPLE CANNOT BELIEVE THAT WHAT 
THEY HAVE BEEN SEEING AND HEARING 
ON THE TELEVISION THE TERRIFYING 
USE HAS TAKEN PLACE RIGHT UNDER 
THEIR NOSES FOR THE LAST TWENTY FOUR YEARS 
AS FOR THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN 
THE CASE THE INTERROGATION IS 
CONTINUING OF JOSEPH FRITZEL AS 
FOR ELIZABETH'S SIX SURVIVING 
CHILDREN THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO 
CARE AND THEY ARE BEING LOOKED 
AFTER BY THE AUTHORITIES STEVE STEVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
RICHARD WHELAN WAS ON A BUS WITH 
HIS GIRLFRIEND WHEN HE WAS STABBED 
TO DEATH AFTER TRYING TO STOP 
ANOTHER PASSENGER FRO ING CHIPS AT 
THEM THE KILLER ANTHONY JOSEPH 
WAS WANTED FOR ANOTHER CRIME BUT 
COMPUTER ERRORS MEANT THAT HIS 
DETAILS WERE NOT SHARED BY ALL 
POLICE FORCES A LACKADAISICAL 
APPROACH TOWARDS THE CASE WAS 
CRITICISED TODAY 
CLUTCHING A BAG OF CHIPS ANTHONY 
JOSEPH BOUGHT A LONDON BUS JUST 
AHEAD OF AN UNSUSPECTING YOUNG 
COUPLE ON THEIR WAY HOME AFTER A 
NIGHT OUT BOARDS A LONDON BUS 
WHEN RICHARD WHELAN TRIED TO STOP 
JOSEPH THROW IN CHIPS AT HIS 
GIRLFRIEND HE PAID WITH HIS LIFE 
STABBED THROUGH THE HEART MINUTES 
LATER JOSEPH WAS CAUGHT ON C. C. T. V. 
SMILING 
RICHARD WAS A VERY PRIVATE SMILING QUIET MAN BROUGHT UP WITH HIGH 
VALUES AND KILLED ON THE EVENING 
SO CALLOUSLY WE MISS RICHARD EVERY 
DAY 
BUT HIS KILLER ANTHONY JOSEPH DAY WAS OUT ON BAIL AFTER BEING 
ARRESTED ON MAY EIGHTEENTH TWO THOUSAND FIVE FOR A 
BURGLARY IN LIVERPOOL HE WAS 
ARRESTED AGAIN ON JUNE TENTH FOR 
ALLEGED SEX OFFENCES IN SURREY 
ALTHOUGH ON JUNE TWENTY SEVENTH AN ARREST 
WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR JUMPING BAIL 
HE WAS STILL RELEASED A MONTH LATER 
FROM A PRISON IN SALFORD DESPITE 
THE OUTSTANDING WARRANT WHEN 
JOSEPH CARRIED OUT HIS WHOLLY 
UNPROVOKED ATTACK ON THE NUMBER FORTY THREE 
BUS HE WAS WANTED FOR BREACHING 
HIS BAIL CONDITIONS TODAY'S REPORT 
SAYS THAT IN GENERAL THERE IS 
LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT SUCH 
CONDITIONS ARE IN FORCE INDEED IT 
TALKS ABOUT A LACKADAISICAL 
NONCHALANT APPROACH 
PEOPLE WOULD 
BE MUCH LESS INCLINED TO COMMIT 
OFFENCES ON BAIL TO BREACH THE 
BAIL CONDITIONS IF THEY BELIEVE 
THAT ACTION WOULD BE TAKEN 
THIS IS 
THE JAIL WHERE JOSEPH WAS RELEASED 
HOURS BEFORE HE STRUCK TODAY'S 
REPORT SAYS THAT ALL PRISONS SHOULD 
URGENTLY GET ACCESS TO THE NATIONAL 
POLICE COMPUTER SYSTEM BUT IT 
ACCEPTS THAT NO ONE COULD PREDICT 
ANTHONY JOSEPH NOW IN BROADMOOR 
SECURE HOSPITAL WOULD COMMIT SUCH 
A TERRIBLE CRIME AGAINST AN 
INNOCENT STRANGER 
TWO TEENAGERS HAVE BEEN JAILED FOR 
LIFE FOR BRUTALLY MURDERING A YOUNG 
WOMAN IN A PARK BECAUSE OF THE WAY 
SHE WAS DRESSED TWENTY YEAR OLD SOPHIE 
LANCASTER WHO WAS A GOTH WAS 
KICKED AND STAMPED TO DEATH AS SHE 
BEGGED THE PAIR TO STOP BEATING HER 
BOYFRIEND IN LANCASHIRE LAST AUGUST 
DESCRIBING THE ATTACK AS A HATE 
CRIME THE JUDGE SAID RYAN HERBERT 
AND BRENDAN HARRIS HAD ACTED IN 
FERAL THUGGERY 
THE ACTOR AND COMEDIAN KRIS 
MARSHALL IS IN HOSPITAL AFTER BEING 
HIT BY A CAR THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD WAS HURT 
ON A NIGHT OUT WITH FRIENDS IN 
BRISTOL AT THE WEEKEND THE STAR OF 
THE B. B. C. SITCOM MY FAMILY IS IN 
INTENSIVE CARE WITH HEAD INJURIES 
BUT HIS CONDITION IS NOT THOUGHT TO 
BE LIFE THREATENING 
AT LEAST SEVEN PEOPLE INCLUDING A 
MOTHER AND HER FOUR CHILDREN HAVE 
BEEN KILLED DURING AN ISRAELI RAID 
IN THE GAZA STRIP THEIR HOME WAS 
HIT AS THEY SAT DOWN FOR BREAKFAST 
THE ISRAELI MILITARY SAY THEY WERE 
RESPONDING FROM MILITANTS' ATTACKS 
IN THE AREA OUR CORRESPONDENT HAS 
BEEN TO THE BORDER BETWEEN ISRAEL 
AND GAZA HE JOINS US FROM THERE 
THE FOUR CHILDREN WHO DIED WERE EIGHTEEN 
MONTHS OLD THREE FOUR AND FIVE THEY WERE 
KILLED SHORTLY AFTER THEY HAD 
GATHERED THE BREAKFAST IN THE 
COURTYARD OF THE FAMILY HOME IN 
GAZA ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS 
HOWEVER ARE IN THE MIDST OF A 
DISPUTE ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED 
FOUR CHILDREN AGED FROM ONE TO 
FIVE AND THEIR MOTHER DIED IN 
THIS HOUSE THE FAMILY WERE JUST 
SITTING HERE EATING SAYS A 
NEIGHBOUR HE BLAMES AN ISRAELI 
MISSILE FOR THE DEATHS THE 
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY ACCUSED 
ISRAEL OF A BARBARIC ACT ISLAMIC 
JIHAD ONE OF GAZA'S MILITANT 
GROUPS CALLED FOR REVENGE SAYING 
THERE WAS NO CHANCE NOW OF A TRUCE 
WITH ISRAEL AT THE HOSPITAL THE 
CHILDREN'S FATHER WAS IN DESPAIR 
AN ISRAELI HELICOPTER DID FIRE A 
MISSILE BUT ISRAEL SAYS IT 
SOLDIERS WERE NOT TO BLAME FOR WHAT 
HAPPENED NEXT TWO PALESTINIAN 
GUNMEN WERE HIT SAID AN ISRAELI 
SPOKESMAN THEY WERE CARRYING BOMBS 
WHICH EXPLODED RIGHT NEXT TO THE 
HOUSE WHERE THE CHILDREN DIED AND 
SAYS ISRAEL MILITARY OPERATIONS 
WILL GO ON AS LONG AS MISSILE 
ATTACKS LIKE THIS ONE TODAY 
CONTINUE AGAINST ISRAELI TOWNS 
THE CHILDREN'S FUNERALS WERE HELD 
THIS AFTERNOON A BID AMID MORE 
EMOTIONAL SCENES THE PALESTINIANS 
SAY THIS IS EVIDENCE OF 
INDISCRIMINATE VIOLENCE BY THE 
ISRAELI ARMY ISRAEL ACCUSES 
PALESTINIAN MILITANTS OF TACTICS 
WHICH PUT CIVILIANS AT RISK 
WHEREVER THE BLAME LIES GAZA IS IN 
FOR ANOTHER PERIOD OF MOURNING THE THE DEATHS OF FOUR CHILDREN IS OF 
COURSE A SHOCKING EVENT THE 
VIOLENCE WHICH CAUSED IT IS NOW 
ALMOST ROUTINE IN GAZA WHAT 
HAPPENED TODAY MAKES THE PROSPECT 
OF A CEASEFIRE MORE DISTANT THAN 
EVER EVER THE TOP STORY TONIGHT A SEVENTY THREE YEAR 
OLD AUSTRIAN MAN HAS ADMITTED TO 
IMPRISONING HIS DAUGHTER AND HAVING 
SEVEN CHILDREN WITH HER 
COMING UP IT'S EXPECTED TO BE ONE 
OF THE BIGGEST SELLING AND MOST 
VIOLENT COMPUTER GAMES OF ALL TIME 
LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON WE TALK TO THE 
CONSERVATIVE LEADER DAVID CAMERON 
ABOUT BORIS JOHNSON'S CHANCES OF 
BECOMING THE MAYOR AND THE FIGHT 
TO SAVE THE NORTH LONDON TRAINING 
CENTRE FOR THESE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE GYMNASTIC 
HOPEFULS 
EXTRA DELIVERIES OF THE FEW WILL 
HAVE BEEN ARRIVING IN SCOTLAND 
WHERE A STRIKE BY OIL REFINERY 
WORKERS IS IN ITS SECOND DAY 
FUEL HUNDREDS OF STAFF WALKED OUT 
IN A DISPUTE OVER PENSIONS SO FAR 
ONLY HANDFUL OF SCOTTISH POLICE 
STATIONS HAVE RUN OUT OF FUEL THE 
STRIKE IS DUE TO BE OVER EARLY 
TOMORROW MORNING BUT THAT IS NOT 
GOING TO BE THE END OF THE PROBLEM 
IS IT 
THAT'S RIGHT YOU CANNOT 
SIMPLY SWITCH THESE KIND OF COMPLEX 
PETROCHEMICAL WORKS ON AND OFF LIKE 
THAT IT WILL TAKE A WEEK TO GET 
THE REFINERY UP AND RUNNING AS FOR 
THE FORTIES PIPELINE WHICH BRINGS 
IN NORTH SEA OIL FROM THE PLATFORMS 
THAT WILL TAKE TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN THE 
MEANTIME TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NO 
FUEL SHORTAGE DURING THAT PERIOD 
THERE IS A FLEET OF SEVEN SHIPS ON 
THEIR WAY FROM CONTINENTAL PORTS 
CARRYING A KEROSENE PETROL AND 
DIESEL THEY WILL BE USED TO 
REPLENISH THE SUPPLIES GOING OUT ON 
AN HOURLY BASIS BY LORRIES FROM 
THIS PLANT OVER TO THE PETROL 
STATIONS ACROSS SCOTLAND RIGHT 
HERE THE FOCUS IS WHAT HAPPENS 
AFTER THE WORKERS GO BACK TOMORROW 
MORNING AND THE PROSPECTS WHAT 
PROSPECTS THERE ARE FOR ANY 
SETTLEMENT NONE SAY UNION IF THE 
COMPANY CONTINUED TO PRESS AHEAD 
WITH PLANS WITH PLANS TO CLOSE 
THE PENSIONS THE COMPANY SAYS IT 
HAS NO CHOICE IT SAYS CURRENT 
LEVELS OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE 
PENSION SCHEMES ARE SIMPLY 
UNSUSTAINABLE AND WILL THREATEN THE 
PLANT'S FUTURE 
AT THE HEART OF THE GRANGEMOUTH 
DISPUTE IS THE ISSUE OVER FINAL 
SALARY PENSIONS ONCE COMMONPLACE 
MANY COMPANIES ARE PHASING THEM OUT 
BECAUSE OF THE COST HE IS SAID TO 
BE THE TENTH RICHEST MAN IN BRITAIN 
NOW JIM RATCLIF FE IS CONFRONTING 
CONFRONTED BY HEMMINGLE WORKERS 
HE HAS GROWN THE COMPANY RAPIDLY 
TAKING OVER THE GRANGEMOUTH 
REFINERY FROM B. P. TWO YEARS AGO HIS 
PLANS TO REFORM THE PENSION SCHEME 
HAVE TRIGGERED THE STRIKE ACTION SO 
WHAT ARE THEY AND CAN THEY BE 
JUSTIFIED UNDER THE EXISTING 
SCHEME IN LINE WITH THAT RUN BY B. P. 
THE EMPLOYER PAYS TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF SALARY 
THE EMPLOYEE MAKES NO CONTRIBUTION 
IT'S OPEN TO EXISTING AND NEW 
WORKERS WITH GUARANTEES OF FINAL 
BENEFITS UNDER THE PROPOSAL IT'S 
HOPED THE EMPLOYER WOULD PAY LESS 
EXISTING EMPLOYEES WOULD PAY SIX PER CENT OF 
THEIR SALARIES IT WOULD NOT BE 
OPEN FOR NEW WORKERS TO JOIN THE 
COMPANY SAYS IT HAS TO CURB 
ESCALATING PENSION COSTS IT'S 
OFFERED A REVIEW ON THE ISSUE OF 
CONTRIBUTIONS THE UNION SAYS 
WORKERS EARN LESS THAN AT OTHER 
REFINERIES SO SHOULDN'T BE EXPECTED 
TO PAY MORE THAN THEIR PENSIONS IT 
CAN'T BE THAT EMPLOYERS CAN DO WHAT 
THEY WANT THIS VERY TO NEGOTIATE 
SERIOUSLY AND UNIONS WILL BATTLE 
HARD TO DEFEND DECENT PENSIONS BUT 
PEOPLE ARE LIVING LONGER AND 
RUNNING PENSION FUNS IS GETTING 
RISKIER SO MANY EMPLOY YEARS ARE 
HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT THE 
TRADITIONAL SCHEMES WITH GUARANTEED 
BENEFITS 
INCREASINGLY EMPLOYERS BENEFITS FELT UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT 
BEARING THAT AMOUNT OF RISK AND 
THEY HAVE INSTEAD INTRODUCED 
ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS WERE IT'S 
THE INDIVIDUAL WHO PICKS UP SOME OF 
THE RISKS 
IT'S BIG 
THE RISKS WHETHER IT'S BIG COMPANIES QUOTED ON THE LONDON 
STOCK EXCHANGE OR SMALLER FIRM 
JUST THIRTY ONE PER CENT OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEFINED 
BENEFIT PENSION SCHEMES ARE OPEN TO 
NEW MEMBERS BRITISH AIRWAYS ROYAL 
BANK OF SCOTLAND AND THE CO OP ARE 
AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE CLOSED THEIRS 
TO NEW RECRUITS IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
CONTRIBUTIONS THE AVERAGE IS TWO 
IT SIX PER CENT AND FOR EMPLOYEES SIXTY ONE PER CENT OF 
THEIR SALARIES THERE AREN'T MANY 
SCHEMES WHERE STAFF DON'T CHIP IN 
LIKE AT GRANGEMOUTH WORKERS ARE 
FIGHTING HARD TO HOLD ON TO WHAT 
THEY HAVE GOT THE ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION IN ZIMBABWE SAYS 
PRESIDENT MUGABE AND TSVANGIRAI 
WILL BE INVITED TO VERIFY RESULTS 
TOMORROW MR. TSVANGIRAI ACCUSES 
MUGABE OF USING THE DELAY TO 
INTIMIDATE VOTERS BEFORE A RUN OFF 
VOTE TWO TRAINS HAVE COLLIDED IN 
CHINA MORE THAN FOUR P. U. N. PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN INJURED IN THE CRASH FOUR HUNDRED 
ONE OF THE TRAINS WAS TRAVELLING 
BETWEEN BEIJING AND THE VENUE FOR 
THE SAILING PART OF THE OLYMPICS 
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET A CHEQUE 
THROUGH THE POST FROM THE 
GOVERNMENT THE IDEA IS TO SPEND IT 
ON ANYTHING YOU LIKE IT'S ALL FOR 
THE SAKE OF THE ECONOMY IT'S JUST 
WHAT PRESIDENT BUSH IS DOING IT'S 
HIS LATEST ATTEMPT TO BREATHE LIFE 
IN THE ECONOMY THE CHEQUES WILL 
VERY SOON BE IN THE POST THE 
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IS GIVING BACK 
BILLIONS WAS TAX DOLLARS TO HELP A 
STRUGGLING ECONOMY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION 
HOUSEHOLDS SHOULD GET A REBATE UP 
TO THREE HUNDRED FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TWICE 
THAT FOR A FAMILY FOR THIS FAMILY 
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A LOT THEY 
LIVE IN MITCH BEGAN A STATE WITH 
REAL ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AND PAYING 
THE BILLS FOR FOOD AND HOUSING IS 
GETTING TOUGHER 
WE LIVE IN A SMALL 
TOWN WE OPEN UP THE NEWSPAPERS AND 
WE HAVE TWO PAGES OF LEGALS OF 
PEOPLE LOSING THEIR HOME A TWELVE HUNDRED 
CHEQUE IS NOT GOING TO HELP THE THE PRICE OF PETROL IS REALLY HURTING N. 
SOME PLACES IT'S HEADING TOWARDS TWO 
A GALLON STILL CHEAP BY EUROPEAN 
STANDARDS BUT AMERICANS JUST 
AREN'T USED TO THIS SO ECONOMISTS 
ARE SAYING IF THESE REBATE CHEQUES 
ARE GOING TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE 
ECONOMY THEN CONSUMERS MUSTN'T PUT 
THEM IN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT OR USE 
THEM TO PAY OFF CREDIT CARD DEBT 
THEY HAVE TO START BUYING THINGS 
BUT MANY AMERICAN HOUSE HLS ARE 
HUGELY IN DEBT SO WILL THE CHEQUES 
STIMULATE THE SHOPPING SPREE THAT 
PRESIDENT BUSH WANTS 
PAY MY BILLS 
GET SOME SCHOOL CLOTHES SUMMER 
CLOTHES WITH IT AND PROBABLY SAVE 
THE REST OF IT 
THAT IS ONE WORTH 
OF RENT FOR ME SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS CAN I PUT IT 
TOWARDS RENT 
IF AMERICA ISN'T 
ALREADY IN RECESSION THEN MANY 
ECONOMISTS ARGUE THAT RECESSION IS 
NOT FAR OFF WITH THE REBATE 
CHEQUES PRESIDENT BUSH IS PUTTING 
ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS BACK INTO 
AMERICAN'S POCKETS NOW HE JUST 
NEEDS THEM TO SPEND IT IT'S ONE OF 
THE MOST KEENLY AWAITED VIDEO GAMES

COMFORT OF YOUR OWN HOME 
GOOD EVENING DOCTORS IN LONDON ARE 
WARNING THAT NOT ENOUGH IS BEING 
DONE TO STOP THE RISE 
OF NEW TYPE OF SUPERBUG THE INFECTION KNOWN AS 
PVL IS SPREADING OUTSIDE HOSPITALS 
OFTEN AMONG CHILDREN IT ATTACKS 
ITS VICTIMS WITH FRIGHTENING SPEED 
ONE OF THOSE IS TEN YEAR OLD DANIEL 
ROBERTS FROM NORTH LONDON WHO 
ALMOST DIED FROM THE BUG AFTER FALL 
OFG A PLAY GROUND SLIDE FALLING 
OFF DANIEL ROBERTS USED TO ENJOY 
NOTHING MORE THAN PLAYING OUTSIDE 
HIS FLAT IN ISLINGTON OVER THE 
SPACE OF TWO DAYS THIS ACTIVE TEN 
YEAR OLD DETERIORATEED BEFORE HIS 
MOTHER'S EYES 
HE HAD MULTIPLE 
ORGAN FAILURES AND HE WAS IN 
INTENSIVE CARE FOR THIRTY FOUR DAYS IT WAS 
A HORRIFYING SITUATION TERRIBLE 
NIGHTMARE 
IT WAS A MONTH AND NIGHTMARE COUNTLESS OPERATIONS BEFORE DOCTORS 
AT SAINT MARY'S DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD 
PVL BACTERIA THIS BACTERIA DOES

BONE 
PVL IS STILL RELATIVELY RARE BONE HERE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM BUT 
IT'S A BIG PROBLEM IN PLACES LIKE 
THE UNITED STATES EXPERTS ARE 
WORRIED THAT NOT ENOUGH RESEARCH IS 
BEING DONE TO STOP THE PROBLEM 
SPREADING 
SUPERFICIAL INFECTIONS WITH 
CHILDREN THE ADVICE SHOULD BE THAT 
THEY ARE CLEANED UP AND COVERED IF 
POSSIBLE TO PREVENT INFECTIONS SUCH 
AS THIS THERE ISN'T EVEN THAT 
LEVEL OF ADVICE FROM THE HEALTH 
PROTECTION AGENCY 
THE HEALTH 
PROTECTION AGENCY SAY THEY ARE 
AWARE OF THE NEED TO KEEP THE

LONDON IT'S ALL BECAUSE A TWENTY INCH 
WATER MAIN BURST UNDERNEATH TOOLEY 
STREET YESTERDAY MORNING BASEMENTS 
AND AN ELECTRICITY SUB STATION WERE 
FLOODED AS A RESULT AFFECTING 
POWER SUPPLIES TO CITY HALL AND 
LOCAL BUSINESSES 
WE CAME RUSHING 
UP TO FIND ONE HUNDRED MEN WORKING HERE IT 
SEEMED LIKE FIRE ENGINES AND WATER 
BOARD OFFICIALS ALL OVER THE PLACE 
OUR KITCHENS WERE FLOODED 
HOW BAD 
IS THE DAMAGE 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO 
SAY WE HAD EIGHTEEN INCHES OF WATER IN 
THE KITCHENS IT HAS COME UP TO 
REFRIGERATION EQUIPMENT AND GAS 
COOKERS OBVIOUSLY THE WATER 
ITSELF CAUSES A LOT OF DAMAGE TO 
OFFICES FILES COMPUTER SYSTEMS 
AS FAR AS THE KITCHEN EQUIPMENT 
GOES IT IS TOO EARLY TO SAY AT AT NEARBY GUY'S HOSPITAL TWENTY ONE NON 
URGENT PLANNED OPERATIONS WERE 
CANCELLED THE MOPPING UP HAS BEEN 
DONE AS THERE MAY ALL CANDIDATES 
ARE RATHER KEEN TO GET INTO CITY 
HALL SO ARE THE ELECTRICIANS 
THE MAYOR CANDIDATES 
WELL THE PROBLEMS BE FIXED BY 
FRIDAY WILL THE PROBLEMS THE THE ELECTION ITSELF IS UNAFFECTED 
LONDONERS WILL GO TO POLLING 
STATIONS AND CAST VOTES AS PLANNED 
IN FACT THE LOCATIONS FOR THE 
COUNTS REMAIN UNCHANGED THEY WILL 
TAKE PLACE AT ALEXANDRA PALACE 
OLYMPIA AND DOCKLANDS BUT 
OFFICIALS HAVE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY 
HURRIEDLY LOOKING AT TWO POSSIBLE 
STANDBY LOCATIONS FOR POSSIBLY 
MOVING THE FINAL DECLARATION EVENT 
THAT'S THE MOMENT WHEN LONDON IS 
TOLD WHO WILL BE MAYOR A FINAL 
DECISION ON WHETHER THEY HAVE TO 
MAKE THAT CHANGE WILL BE GIVEN IN 
THE MORNING IT IS EXPECTED THAT 
CITY HALL WILL BE CLOSED AGAIN 
TOMORROW TOMORROW HUNDREDS OF PROTESTERS MARCHED 
THROUGH CENTRAL LONDON TODAY TO 
REMEMBER THOSE KILLED AND INJURED 
AT WORK CAMPAIGNERS ARE CALLING ON 
THE GOVERNMENT TO INCREASE WORKERS' 
RIGHTS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES LAST 
WEEK TWO MEN DIED AFTER FALLING 
FROM BUILDING SITES IN WESTMINSTER 
AND WANDSWORTH 
POLICE WEARING FLOWING CAPES COULD 
ONCE AGAIN BECOME A FAMILIAR SIGHT 
ON THE STREETS OF THE CAPITAL THE 
FINAL DESIGNS HAVE BEEN CHOSEN FROM 
A COMPETITION AT THE LONDON COLLEGE 
OF FASHION TO FIND A NEW UNIFORM 
FOR THE MET POLICE AND INCLUDE AN 
UPDATED VERSION OF THE CLASSIC 
VICTORIAN CLOAK 
IT WAS PARTLY A 
HISTORICAL THING GOING BACK TO THE 
OLD BOBBIES ON THEIR BICYCLES ALSO 
A PRACTICAL REASON THERE'S A 
LEGISLATION HEALTH AND SAFETY 
NUMBER FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO 
HAVE OH NINE SQUARE METRES OF HIGH 
VISIBILITY FABRIC ON SHOW THE MOST 
EFFICIENT WAY OF DOING THAT IS IN A 
CIRCLE PATTERN 
STILL TO COME BEFORE SEVEN THE 
FIGHT TO SAVE THE NORTH LONDON 
TRAINING CENTRE FOR THESE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
GYMNASTICS HOPEFULS 
AND CRIPPEN IN THE DOCK JUST ONE 
OF THE THOUSANDS OF OLD BAILEY 
COURT CASES WHICH CAN NOW BE VIEWED 
ONLINE 
IF YOU HAVEN'T DECIDED HOW TO CAST 
YOUR VOTE IN THURSDAY'S ELECTIONS 
FOR MAYOR THERE IS NOT LONG TO 
DECIDE THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN WE 
HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON THE BIG 
ISSUES WHICH COULD SWING VOTERS 
TONIGHT WE ARE LOOKING AT CRIME 
OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT HAS 
THIS SPECIAL REPORT 
YOUTH CRIME HAS AFFECTED ME L. AM 
QUITE CONCERNED ABOUT IT 
GUN CRIME 
AND KNIVES SEEMS TO HAVE GOT OUT OF 
CONTROL 
I DON'T FEEL AS SAFE WHERE CONTROL I LIVE IN THE CENTRE OF TOWN DEFINITELY 
VOICES OF LONDONERS DEFINITELY CONFIRMING THEIR NUMBER ONE 
PRIORITY 
READING EVERY WEEK IN THE PRIORITY PAPER ABOUT A CHILD BEING MURDERED 
SOMEONE BEEN STABBED IT HAS BEEN 
ON THE INCREASE 
IT IS WHY CRIME 
AND THE FEAR OF IT IS A TOP 
ELECTION ISSUE HARDLY A WEEK GOES 
BY WITHOUT ANOTHER YOUNG PERSON 
LOSING THEIR LIFE TO GUNS AND 
KNIVES YET ANOTHER FAMILY LEFT 
DEVASTATED SO WE HAVE BEEN 
LOOKING AT THE THREE MAIN 
CANDIDATES FOR MAYOR WHAT 
POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS DO THEY HAVE 
FIRST KEN LIVINGSTONE 
HE SAYS HE 
HAS ACHIEVED A LOT A RECORD NUMBER 
OF POLICE TEN THOUSAND EXTRA OFFICERS 
SINCE FIRST ELECTED AND SAFER 
NEIGHBOURHOOD TEAMS IN EVERY WARD 
IN EVERY BAR IN THE CAPITAL HE 
SAYS IT WILL BE MORE OF THE SAME 
IN EVERY BOROUGH ALSO PROMISING 
TOUGHER ACTION AGAINST VIOLENT 
CRIME METAL DETECTORS IN SCHOOLS 
EVEN SUGGESTING POLICE RAIDS BUT 
PUPILS CARRYING KNIVES ARRESTED 
BUT IS IT WORKABLE 
WE HAVE GOT 
SEVEN ENTRANCES IN THE SCHOOL EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY 
PEOPLE WHERE WILL WE GET SEVEN 
PEOPLE TO MAN THE METAL DETECTORS 
AS CHILDREN IN HOW DO YOU GET EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY 
KIDS INTO SCHOOL EFFICIENTLY THEY 
WILL BE QUEUING DOWN THE ROAD TO 
GET IN IT IS JUST NOT WORKABLE 
KEN LIVINGSTONE'S OTHER IDEAS IS 
GETTING YOUNG PEOPLE OFF THE 
STREETS DIVERTING THEM AWAY FROM 
GANGS HE PLEDGES SEVENTY NINE MILLION FOR 
YOUTH SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES 
INCLUDING MORE SPORT AND A 
HELPLINE FOR PARENTS WORRIED ABOUT 
THEIR KIDS BUT HE SAID IT IS NOT 
JUST UP TO A MAYOR OR POLICE 
COMMISSIONER TO HAVE THE ANSWERS 
SO DOES THIS MAN HAVE MAGIC 
PILL BORIS JOHNSON CLAIMS THAT 
MOST LONDONERS DO NOT FEEL ANY 
SAFER AFTER EIGHT YEARS BUT 
LIVINGSTONE LIVINGSTONE IN PARTICULAR THE WORRY IS VIOLENT 
CRIME HE FEELS IT COULD BE MORE 
STOP AND SEARCH WITH LESS RED TAPE 
TO FEEL TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR 
OFFICERS TO CATCH THOSE CARRYING 
WEAPONS HE THINKS MORE HAND HELD 
CAMERAS SCAMMERS AT TRANSPORT 
HUBS AND BIG EVENTS WILL BE A 
DETERRENT HE ALSO INTENDS TO 
INTRODUCE CRIME MAPPING WHERE 
POLICE IDENTIFY HOT SPOTS FOR 
BURGLARY AND SHARE THE INFORMATION 
WITH THE PUBLIC 
HAND HELD SCANNERS 
STOP AND SEARCH TACTICS NONE OF 
THOSE ARE REALLY GETTING TO THE 
ISSUE TO UNDERSTAND WHY MORE YOUNG 
PEOPLE CARRYING KNIVES AND WHY 
MORE YOUNG PEOPLE USE THEM FINALLY FINALLY HOW DOES THIS MAN A FORMER POLICE 
OFFICER SQUARE UP TRY AND PANIC 
SAYS HE WILL LISTEN TO LONDONERS 
AND HE WILL IMPROVE FOR STOP AND 
SEARCH DRY AND PADDOCK HE SAYS 
THAT WILL HELP TO BUILD UP TRUST 
YOUNG PEOPLE CAN TROLL CRIME IN 
LONDON 
THEY ARE SELFISH 
YOUNG LONDON PEOPLE CONTROL CRIME IN LONDON 
COMMUNITY WORKERS COMMUNITY POLICE 
OFFICERS WORKING WITH YOUNG 
PEOPLE THE IDEA OF STOP AND 
SEARCH AS A MAGIC BULLET IS JUST 
WRONG 
HE ALSO WANTS LOCAL POLICE WRONG STATIONS TO STAY OPEN ACROSS LONDON 
MAKING IT EASY TO REPORT CRIME 
THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE POLICIES 
OF THE THREE MAIN CANDIDATES DO 
ANY OF THEM HAVE THE ANSWERS TO 
COMBATING YOUTH CRIME IT IS A 
COMPLEX SUBJECT MANY SOCIAL AND 
ECONOMIC ISSUES THERE IS NO QUICK 
FIX ON 
FIRST YOU CAN DECIDE 
BY ALL ACCOUNTS IT'S GOING TO BE A 
CLOSE RACE BETWEEN TORY CANDIDATE 
BORIS JOHNSON AND LABOUR'S KEN 
LIVINGSTONE JOINING ME THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY LEADER DAVID 
CAMERON THEY ARE TAKING THE TIME 
A PLEASURE 
WHICH IS MORE WORRYING 
A BORIS WIN OR A BORIS DEFEAT 
I AM 
VERY KEEN FOR HIM TO WIN HE HAS 
FOUGHT A FIRST CLASS CAMPAIGN WITH 
ENORMOUS ENERGY HE HAS SHOWN HOW 
SERIOUSLY HE WANTS THE JOB HE HAS 
SET OUT SOME ATTRACTIVE 
ATTRACTIVE IDEAS HE TALKED ABOUT A 
MAYOR'S FUND FOR LONDON FOR 
CHARITIES KEN LIVINGSTONE NOW SAYS 
IT IS A GREAT IDEA HE TALKS ABOUT 
PEOPLE LOSING THEIR BUS PASSES IF 
THEY BEHAVE BADLY AND THEY HAVE TO 
LEARN IT BACK TEN IS GOING TO TAKE 
ON THE IDEA HE HAS SET THE AGENDA 
IN AN EXCITING WAY 
ARE THEY HIS 
IDEAS 
YES YOU ARE SEEING SOMEONE IDEAS WHO IS PASSIONATE ABOUT LONDON 
ABOUT THE JOB HE WANTS TO GET 
THINGS DONE HE HAS PUT CRIME AS 
THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IN HIS AGENDA 
A VERY GOOD PIECE WHERE YOU SHOULD 
THE CRIME MAPPING INITIATIVE 
GIVING PEOPLE THE CRACK THE POWER 
TO KNOW WHICH CRIMES ARE TAKING 
PLACE 
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE PLACE CONCERNED THAT YOU MIGHT CONTROL 
BORIS WHEN HE IS THE MAYOR IN THE 
SAME WAY THE PARTY CONTROLS HIM AS 
A CANDIDATE 
NOBODY CONTROLS BORIS 
THIS IS HIS CAMPAIGN HIS IDEAS HE 
WANTED TO DO IT 
SO YOU DON'T 
THINK IT IS NOT JUST HIS HAIR THAT 
HAS BEEN FLATTENED HIS PERSONALITY 
HAS NOT BEEN FLATTENED 
HE HAS GOT 
HUGE PERSONALITY LOTS OF CHARISMA 
HE IS A LEADER HE WILL DO A VERY 
GOOD JOB FOR LONDON AND I HAVE NOT 
CONTROLLED HIS CAMPAIGN L. HAVE 
ENJOYED GOING ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
AND WORKING WITH HIM BUT THESE ARE 
HIS POLICIES AND HE IS REALLY 
PASSIONATE ABOUT THE JOB THAT 
SHINES THROUGH WE ARE SEEING A 
HUGE ROW A RUCK HIM BECAUSE KEN 
LIVINGSTONE'S PEOPLE ARE SAYING 
THAT BORIS WANTS TO BAN THE KORAN 
BOOK ERUPTING 
YOU HAVE SAID HE 
IS HIS OWN MAN BUT HE HAS REFUSED 
TO SAY THAT IF HE BECOMES MAYOR 
WHO HAS BIG PLAYERS ARE GOING TO BE 
DON'T YOU THINK LONDONERS DESERVE 
TO KNOW THAT 
THE BIG MAN WILL BE 
BORIS HE WILL BE THE MAYOR OF 
LONDON IF HE WINS HE WILL WANT A 
VERY STRONG TEAM 
BUT WHY CAN'T HE 
NAMED THE TEAM 
THAT'S HIS CAMPAIGN 
YOU'RE SAYING YOU WILL HAVE NO 
INPUT AT ALL INTO HIS TOP TEAM 
OBVIOUSLY WE TALK ABOUT THESE 
THINGS BUT THEY WILL BE HIS 
APPOINTMENTS HIS IDEAS NO ONE 
CONTROLS BORIS THAT IS PART OF THE 
BRILLIANCE OF THE DIE 
THE CHARM 
IF YOU LIKE YEAH 
OF THE GUY HE YEAH SAID HE WOULD EMBARRASS ANY 
GOVERNMENT IN POWER IN THE 
INTERESTS OF LONDONERS 
I THINK 
BORIS WILL STAND UP FOR LONDON IF 
THAT MEANS HAVING A HUGE ROW WITH A 
LABOUR PRIME MINISTER OR A 
CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER BORIS 
WILL DO THAT L. THINK THAT IS RIGHT 
DEVOLUTION CANNOT MEAN THAT 
SOMEHOW THE PARTY IN POWER TRIES 
TO CONTROL THE MAYOR THE MAYOR HAS 
TO SPEAK FOR LONDON THAT IS WHAT 
BORIS WILL DO IF I AM PRIME 
MINISTER AND HE IS THE MAYOR HE 
WILL NOT GIVE ME AN EASY TIME AND 
THAT IS RIGHT 
SO YOU ARE CONFIDENT 
COMFORTABLE HAVING POLICIES THAT 
ARE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED TO 
GOVERNMENT POLICIES HE IS 
UNCONDITIONALLY REJECTING HEATHROW 
EXPANSION IT SOUNDS LIKE HE COMES 
FROM A DIFFERENT PARTY LET ME SHOW 
YOU AN EXAMPLE 
LET'S TAKE ONE 
EXAMPLE ONE POINT VERY SIMPLY KEN 
HAS OFTEN SAID THINGS 
THAT ARE OPPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT 
IF YOU HAD A MAYOR OF LONDON YOU 
CANNOT REMOTE CONTROL THAT PERSON 
AND SAY BECAUSE YOU ARE A LABOUR 
MAYOR YOU AGREE WITH EVERYTHING 
THE LABOUR PARTY DOES IT IS 
BORIS'S RESPONSIBILITY TO DRAW UP 
HIS MANIFESTO AND DRIVE IT THROUGH 
FOR THE PEOPLE OF LONDON WHERE WE 
DISAGREE WE WILL HAVE A DEBATE 
THAT'S FINE 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT 
ONE INCIDENT 
HOLD ON 
SORRY A FINAL POINT WHICH IS 
RELEVANT TO THIS AREA WILL NOT 
SUPPORT IN FACT I WILL OPPOSE A 
THIRD RUNWAY THERE IS NO REASON 
FOR A THIRD RUNWAY AM SORRY I AM 
INTERRUPTING A VERY IMPORTANT 
TELEVISION INTERVIEW 
YOU WILL 
DISCUSS IT BEFOREHAND RATHER THAN 
BEING SURPRISED 
BORIS'S VIEWS ON 
THE THIRD RUNWAY AT ARE WELL KNOWN 
HE IS PERFECTLY ALLOWED TO OPPOSE A 
THIRD RUNWAY AS THE MAYOR L. WILL 
LET THEM GO THROUGH THE SYSTEM AS A 
POTENTIAL PRIME MINISTER THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS NOT MADE A CASE FOR 
A THIRD RUNWAY WE HAVE TO SET 
TESTS IN TERMS OF NOISE POLLUTION 
NITROUS OXIDE CARBON DIOXIDE 
POLLUTION BUT HE IS PERFECTLY 
WITHIN HIS RIGHTS TO SAY THAT DO DO YOU WORRY THAT HE WOULD BE A 
LIABILITY IF HE WAS ELECTED MAYOR 
FOR YOU 
NO I THINK HE HAS PROVED 
HIMSELF DURING THE CAMPAIGN HE IS 
THE ONE WITH THE ENERGY THE VISION 
THE IDEAS FOR THE FUTURE OF LONDON 
EVEN KEN LIVINGSTONE'S BEST FRIENDS 
WOULD SAY TWO TERMS ARE ENOUGH 
HOWEVER YOU ARE GOING TO VOTE GO 
OUT AND VOTE DON'T SIT THERE AND 
BE SURPRISED IF YOU FAIL TO VOTE 
YOU HAVE SUDDENLY GOT KEN 
LIVINGSTONE FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS 
YOU ONLY GET ONE CHANCE
