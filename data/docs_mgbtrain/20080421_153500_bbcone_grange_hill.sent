BOARDERMAN IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT 
YOU KNOW I WASN'T REALLY THAT BOTHERED 
ABOUT MY GAME GETTING SMASHED

HE'S RUINING OUR CHANCES OF GETTING HEARD 
WE'VE GOT TO BRING HIM DOWN RACHE 
IT'S LUCKY I KNOW WHO HE IS THEN ISN'T IT

SO YOU GONNA DO A STUNT TODAY YEAH TODAY ERM 
TODAY TODAY TODAY 
WHY CAN'T I JUST TELL THEM IT WAS ME IT'LL GET YOU CAUGHT 
BUT I DID ALL THE STUNTS AND HE'S GETTING ALL THE ATTENTION 
IT'S NOT ABOUT ATTENTION THEO 
A HERO ALWAYS PUTS THE GREATER GOOD BEFORE HIS OWN PERSONAL GAIN 
THUNDERMAN SAYS SO 
YOU'VE GOT A CHANCE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE HERE 
AND WE'VE GOT GOOD SUPPORT BUT WE NEED MORE WE NEED ANOTHER STUNT 
GOT ANY IDEAS 
AM I IN A STRAWBERRY SORT OF MOOD OR A LEMON AND LIME STRAWBERRY 
DOORS DON'T OPEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE HOLDING THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE 
NEXT TIME YOU'RE GONNA DO A STUNT 
MAKE SURE WE HAVEN'T BEEN FOLLOWING YOU ALL BREAK BOARDERMAN 
OR SHOULD I SAY 
X. S. 
RIGHT MR. MCDONNELL'S OFFICE YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG 
X. S. ISN'T BOARDERMAN NOW 
BUT X. S. ISN'T BOARDERMAN THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HONEST 
COME ON AH PLEASE NOT MCD 
IT AIN'T X. S. IT AIN'T 
PLEASE MISS 
AND SO BEGAN THE DARKEST DAYS OF BOARDERMAN 
HIS REPUTATION WAS IN TATTERS 
SO ED SEEMS THE RUMOURS ARE TRUE 
BOARDERMAN'S BEEN CAUGHT AND HE'S GONNA BE IN ISOLATION EVERY BREAK 
IF NOT EXCLUDED 
OR EVEN WORSE 
WHAT ABOUT THE REPORTS THAT HE BEGGED AND PLEADED AND SAID IT WASN'T HIM 
HE WAS EMBARRASSING ED 
A HUGE LETDOWN TO ANYONE WHO EVER SUPPORTED HIM 
HIS ENEMIES WERE ALLOWED TO RULE UNCHECKED 
BAN THE BALL BAN THE BALL BAN THE BALL 
A MIGHTY HERO HAD FALLEN 
NO MORE SKATEBOARDING HERE 
CAN'T GIVE UP BUT HOW CAN BOARDERMAN COME BACK NOW 
EVERYONE THINKS HE'S A LOSER AND A WUSS 
THERE'S GOT TO BE ANOTHER WAY HOW MCD'S GONNA HUMILIATE X. S. IN ASSEMBLY 
IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL 
THE WHOLE SCHOOL 
I'M GOING TO BEGIN BY TALKING ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY 
WHAT DOES RESPONSIBILITY MEAN 
IT MEANS THAT YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF LOOKING AFTER SOMETHING 
YOU HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOURSELF 
YOUR ACTIONS AT ALL TIMES 
IN A COMMUNITY LIKE THIS YOU HAVE TO RESPONSIBLE FOR OTHERS TOO 
YOU HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SCHOOL ITSELF 
ONE OF US HAS MANAGED 
TO BE COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT WAYS 
COME ON MR. SMITH 
X. S. 
I THINK SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE GOT TO KNOW ERIC BETTER AS BOARDERMAN 
SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE CONSIDERED BOARDERMAN A HERO 
HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ONE TO ME 
HE LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE WHO'S LOST HIS BREAKS AND HIS LUNCHTIMES 
FOR THE REST OF THIS SCHOOL YEAR WHY 
BECAUSE HE IRRESPONSIBLY PUT HIMSELF AT RISK 
BECAUSE HE IRRESPONSIBLY PUT OTHERS AT RISK 
BECAUSE HE IRRESPONSIBLY DEFIED THE RULES THAT EXIST TO PROTECT US ALL 
THAT'S NOT WHAT I CALL A HERO 
IF ANYONE CAN SEE A HERO ON THIS STAGE THEN PLEASE POINT HIM OUT 
COME BACK RIGHT NOW 
MR. MCDONNELL ARE YOU ALL RIGHT 
BOARDERMAN HAS RETURNED IN INCREDIBLE FASHION 
NO IMPOSTORS THIS WAS THE REAL DEAL 
THAT'S RIGHT THE SCHOOL HAS GONE IN TO ANOTHER BOARDERMAN FRENZY 
SIGNATURES TO THE PETITION HAVE ROCKETED THERE'S OVER THREE HUNDRED NAMES 
DEMANDING THAT SKATEBOARDERS 
MR. MCDONNELL WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF 
I HAVE AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE 
IN LIGHT OF EVENTS I'VE DECIDED TO REVIEW THE SKATEBOARD BAN 
DOES THAT MEAN SKATEBOARDING IS ALLOWED 
I CAN'T ALLOW UNSUPERVISED SKATEBOARDING 
THERE'S FAR TOO MUCH RISK OF INJURY 
HOWEVER I AM PREPARED TO ORGANISE AN AFTER SCHOOL SKATEBOARDING CLUB 
WITH FULL SAFETY PRECAUTIONS IN PLACE 
PROPER TRAINING GIVEN AND TRANSPORT TO A SKATEPARK 
AH THAT'S FANTASTIC NEWS FOR SKATEBOARDERS 
THERE'S ONLY ONE CONDITION 
BOARDERMAN MUST GIVE HIMSELF UP 
BY END OF SCHOOL TODAY OTHERWISE 
NO CLUB 
LOOKS LIKE YOUR HERO JUST GOT TOTALLY STUFFED 
LOOKS LIKE A MAJOR VICTORY FOR OUR CAMPAIGN 
YEAH AND HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE YOU GOT ON YOUR WEBSITE NOW ABOUT TWO 
A FEW SOME VICTORY YOU'VE STILL GOT NO SUPPORTERS 
DEAD PROUD ARE YOU 
WE'RE OUT TO HELP OTHERS JUST AS MUCH AS BOARDERMAN MORE 
NO HE JUST WANTS TO GET ON WITH WHAT HE ENJOYS 
WITHOUT BOTHERING OTHER PEOPLE 
YOU WANT TO STOP EVERYONE ELSE'S ENJOYMENT BECAUSE IT BOTHERS YOU 
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE 
YOU CAN'T MAKE PEOPLE WANT THE SAME THING 
TRY THINKING ABOUT WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE WANTS 
AND FINDING A SOLUTION THAT SUITS YOU ALL 
THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE SENSIBLE 
FOR YOU YEAH COS SHE'S READING IT OFF BOARDERMAN'S WEBSITE 
WHAT DO I DO I DUNNO 
WHAT WOULD THUNDERMAN DO 
HE DOES GET INTO A SITUATION LIKE THIS 
HE HAS TO TAKE A PLASMA MISSILE IN THE CHEST FOR HIM TO SAVE THE U. S. A. 
AND 
AND SO HE STOPS TIME ALLOWING HIM TO BLOCK UP THE GUN IT MISFIRES 
AND DESTROYS THE ULTRA PIGS 
SO OH RIGHT 
LET'S DO THAT THEN 
MCD'S TRYING TO BLACKMAIL YOU 
WHY SHOULD YOU GIVE IN 
COS IF I DON'T EVERYONE LOSES OUT AGAIN 
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE EITHER WAY 
AFTER ALL YOU'VE DONE HOW AM I GONNA FEEL IF I SAY NOTHING 
I SAID NOTHING BEFORE AND I FELT TERRIBLE 
I MEAN OWNING UP ISN'T THAT BEING A HERO 
SO I'VE HEARD BOARDERMAN'S GOT A BIT OF A DILEMMA WHOEVER HE IS 
YOU KNOW I'VE KNOWN SINCE I SAW YOUR MOVES 
I THOUGHT THAT MUST BE BENSON BLOOD I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO 
I CAN EITHER HELP EVERYONE OR I CAN HELP MYSELF 
WHAT'S RIGHT 
BUT HE ALSO KNOWS WHEN TO CHEAT 
AND SO BOARDERMAN FACED HIS GREATEST CHALLENGE HIMSELF 
BOARDERMAN 
I DON'T KNOW IF THE LISTENERS ARE GETTING THIS ED 
BUT I'M ACTUALLY FOLLOWING BOARDERMAN ME AND A FEW OTHERS 
HE KNOWS THE TEACHERS HAVE SEEN HIM HE'S MAKING NO EFFORT TO GET AWAY 
OF COURSE THE BIG QUESTION IS 
WILL BOARDERMAN GIVE HIMSELF UP TO MR. MCDONNELL 
WILL HE SUBMIT TO HIS TERMS 
BOARDERMAN IS HEADED FOR MCDONNELL'S OFFICE 
I THINK HE'S ABOUT TO GIVE HIMSELF UP 
I'M BOARDERMAN 
STEP INTO MY OFFICE NO I'M BOARDERMAN 
YOU CAN BOTH COME INTO MY OFFICE 
I'M BOARDERMAN I'M BOARDERMAN I'M BOARDERMAN 
I'M BOARDERMAN 
I'M BOARDERMAN SO AM I 
I'M BOARDERMAN ME TOO 
ERM MR. MCDONNELL CAN I HAVE A WORD NONE OF YOU MOVE 
AMAZING SCENES OUTSIDE MR. MCDONNELL'S OFFICE 
I'VE HAD A TALK WITH MISS MCILROY 
SEEMS SHE'S VERY IMPRESSED BY YOUR SHOW OF SOLIDARITY 
MR. MCDONNELL HAS KINDLY AGREED THAT THE SKATEBOARDING CLUB CAN GO AHEAD 
YES 
SKATEBOARDING IS NOW BACK IN SCHOOL 
AS LONG AS BOARDERMAN DISAPPEARS FOREVER YES SIR 
SO ENDED THE ADVENTURES OF BOARDERMAN 
SOME SAID THAT HIS WHEELS WERE HUNG UP FOREVER 
OTHERS THAT THEY WERE JUST RESTING READY TO ROLL AGAIN 
WHEN EVIL ROAMED THE EARTH ONCE MORE 
THE END 
RUBBISH I USED TO THINK THESE WERE REALISTIC
