MY PREROGATIVE BY BRITNEY SPEARS 
CHELSEA WHITE IS CELEBRATING HER EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY 
IT'S MORE THAN A COMING OF AGE 
ALREADY A SUCCESSFUL TEENAGE MODEL CHELSEA IS THINKING OF DOING SOMETHING 
THAT COULD MAKE OR BREAK HER CAREER 
SOMETHING SHE CAN ONLY DO FROM TODAY ENTER THE WORLD OF GLAMOUR 
IF I WANTED TO TODAY I COULD GO AND DO A TOPLESS PHOTO SHOOT 
BUT YESTERDAY I COULDN'T 
AND SHE'S NOT ALONE 
MORE TEENAGERS THAN EVER BEFORE ARE DESPERATE TO BE A PAGE THREE GIRL 
I GUESS IT'S A BIT OF A NEW PHENOMENON ISN'T IT REALLY 
PERHAPS ON THE BACK OF BIG BROTHER AND JORDAN AND 
IT'S QUITE WORRYING REALLY 
KIDS USED TO ASPIRE TO BE LAWYERS AND DOCTORS 
NOW UNFORTUNATELY IT'S GLAMOUR MODELLING 
BUT WHAT AWAITS HER IN THE WORLD OF GLAMOUR 
FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS SHE'S BEEN FINDING OUT 
AND IN THE PROCESS SHE'S LOST HER INNOCENCE 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR BOOBS DARLING 
THAT'S MY PREROGATIVE 
THAT'S MY PREROGATIVE 
JUST SWAP YOUR LEGS DARLING THAT'S NICE THAT'S CUTESY 
EACH YEAR THOUSANDS OF GIRLS ENTER THE SUN'S PAGE THREE IDOL COMPETITION 
SHE'S A MODEL AND SHE'S LOOKING GOOD 
THEY DON'T SEE IT AS SEXPLOITATION 
BUT AS AN ACCEPTABLE CAREER OPPORTUNITY OFFERING FAME AND FORTUNE 
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER YOU LOOK UP TO PEOPLE NOW 
LIKE JORDAN KELLY BROOK PEOPLE LIKE THAT 
THEY'RE AN INSPIRATION TO GIRLS LIKE ME 
COS THEY'VE DONE SO WELL FOR THEMSELVES 
I THINK THE PERCEPTION OF GLAMOUR MODELS HAS CHANGED 
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THEY'RE NOW 
IT'S A MUCH MORE SOUGHT AFTER PROFESSION 
IT'S NOT SEEN AS BEING SLUTTY OR TARTY 
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT ANY MORE 
I THINK NOW IT'S A VERY WELL WANTED PROFESSION FOR GIRLS 
PEOPLE HAVE REALISED THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE THICK TO BE A MODEL 
IT WASN'T REALLY SOMETHING THAT I DID REALLY LOOK INTO DOING 
BUT SINCE I DID MY FIRST SHOOT 
I ENJOYED IT SO MUCH THAT I JUST REALLY WANTED TO DO IT FROM THEN 
SWITCH YOUR SHOULDERS TOWARDS ME 
GOOD GIRL 
I'M NINETEEN I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO IT SINCE I WAS QUITE YOUNG 
IN A RECENT TELEPHONE POLL SIXTY THREE PER CENT OF GIRLS AGED BETWEEN SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR 
CLAIMED THEY'D RATHER BE A GLAMOUR MODEL THAN A NURSE OR A TEACHER 
BUT IT'S ILLEGAL TO POSE TOPLESS IN THE U. K. UNTIL YOU'RE EIGHTEEN 
AND TWO MONTHS BEFORE HER BIRTHDAY 
CHELSEA'S ALREADY THINKING ABOUT HER PLACE IN THE SUN 
I LOOK AT PAGE THREE MOST DAYS MY MUM BUYS IT 
SO IT'LL BE IN THE KITCHEN AND I'LL JUST TURN TO THAT PAGE 
I DON'T TEND TO LOOK AT ANY OTHER PAGE 
I THINK PAGE THREE IS VERY TASTEFUL 
IT'S NOT TOP SHELF STUFF OR ANYTHING 
IT'S ONLY WHAT YOU SEE DOWN THE BEACH 
SO IT'S VERY GIRL NEXT DOOR TYPE OF IMAGE 
AND THAT'S AN IMAGE THAT I'D LIKE TO PORTRAY 
PAGE THREE OF THE SUN AND SPECIFICALLY THE SUN 
IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE PINNACLE OF GLAMOUR MODELLING 
WE TAKE VERY VERY VERY FEW GIRLS' 
THEY NEED REAL BOOBS THAT ARE GREAT 
THEY NEED TO HAVE GREAT SKIN GREAT HAIR GREAT TEETH LOVELY EYES 
YOU'VE REALLY GOT TO BE NIGH ON PERFECT TO BE A PAGE THREE GIRL 
BUT FORTUNATELY THERE'S LOTS OF ACE PEOPLE OUT THERE 
IT USED TO BE THAT IF A GIRL APPEARED ON PAGE THREE 
HER CAREER WAS MADE 
IT WAS A GOOD STEPPING STONE ON TO VARIOUS OTHER THINGS 
ACTING T. V. PRESENTING OR WHATEVER ELSE 
UNFORTUNATELY GONE ARE THE DAYS OF PAGE THREE GIRLS BEING HOUSEHOLD NAMES 
I REMEMBER WHEN THEY USED TO OPEN SHOPPING CENTRES NIGHTCLUBS AND THE LIKES 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOT ANY MORE ERM 
IT'S STILL TOUGH THERE ARE STILL NO GUARANTEES 
YEAH IT'S GREAT TO APPEAR ON PAGE THREE 
IN TERMS OF A GIRL'S INCOME 
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE EIGHTY PER CENT OF THEIR REPUTATION 
BECAUSE THEY ARE A PAGE THREE GIRL BUT ONLY TWENTY PER CENT OF THEIR INCOME 
THE LIFESPAN ISSUE ON A GLAMOUR MODEL YOU CAN WORK UP TO 
IF YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL THEN YOU CAN WORK UP TO LIKE TWENTY SEVEN 
IT'S NOT A REALLY LONG CAREER YOU CAN GO INTO 
DOING THE COMMERCIAL MODELLING AFTERWARDS AS WELL 
BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE AS CHELSEA WILL DISCOVER 
WHILE SOME TEENAGERS SEE KELLY BROOK AND JORDAN AS THEIR ROLE MODELS 
CHELSEA'S HERO IS THE CURRENT QUEEN OF GLAMOUR KEELEY HAZELL 
WHO LAST YEAR EARNED OVER A QUARTER OF A MILLION POUNDS 
AND IT'S THE MONEY THAT'S ATTRACTIVE 
I'M DOING IT FOR LIKE THE BUSINESS 
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE SEEING YOU IN THE FLESH IT IS ONLY A PICTURE 
I HAVE TRIED OFFICE WORK 
NO OFFENCE TO OFFICE STAFF BUT I DON'T LIKE IT I LASTED A MONTH 
ACCORDING TO THE SUNDAY TIMES RICH LIST TWENTY NINE YEAR OLD JORDAN 
WHO FIRST APPEARED ON PAGE THREE AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN 
IS NOW WORTH THIRTY MILLION 
YOUNG GIRLS DON'T SEE 
GIRLS GETTING THEIR BOOBS OUT IN PAPERS AS SEXPLOITATION 
BECAUSE THEY SEE THAT THE GIRLS WHO HAVE DONE THAT 
ARE EARNING A LOT OF MONEY AND SEEM TO BE LIVING A REALLY EXCITING LIFE 
THAT'S IT THAT'S LOVELY 
THEY'LL GET A LIVING WAGE FROM JUST THE SUN ALONE 
BUT BECAUSE OF THE INTEREST THAT THE COMPETITION SORT OF GENERATES 
THEY'LL GET OFFERED SHOOTS WITH OTHER MAGAZINES WHICH OBVIOUSLY 
THEY'LL MAKE MONEY FROM 
THEY CAN MAKE CERTAINLY OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR 
THE GIRLS WHO WANT TO BE GLAMOUR MODELS 
THEY DO SEEM TO SEE IT AS EMPOWERING 
AND EMPOWERING FOR THEM IS MAKING A LOT OF MONEY 
BUT THAT'S NOT EMPOWERING 
I MEAN IT'S JUST BEING IN A PICTURE THAT BLOKES CAN DROOL OVER 
ERM AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT EMPOWERING FOR WOMEN 
WE'VE HAD GIRLS WRITING INTO THE MAGAZINE 
SAYING THEY WANT TO BE A MODEL FROM AS YOUNG AS THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN 
WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT SCARY 
INTERNATIONAL MODEL MANAGEMENT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST GLAMOUR AGENCIES IN THE COUNTRY 
SUPPLYING GIRLS FOR MAGAZINES LIKE LOADED FHM AND BOYS TOYS 
IF YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL YOU CAN MAKE A VERY GOOD LIVING ERM 
YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME GIRLS IN THE BUSINESS 
WHO ARE EARNING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR PLUS 
BUT THEY'RE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN 
FOR EVERY ONE OF THEM THERE'S PROBABLY TWENTY 
THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE A LIVING 
IT'S VERY VERY COMPETITIVE 
WE GET TWO HUNDRED GIRLS A WEEK WRITING IN TO US 
AND WE TRY NOT TAKE ON MORE THAN ONE GIRL A WEEK 
CHELSEA'S MOTHER MICHELLE HAS NO QUALMS ABOUT LETTING HER DAUGHTER 
GO TOPLESS IN NATIONAL PUBLICATIONS IF THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO 
IN FACT SHE'S ENCOURAGING HER 
I LOVE SEEING CHELSEA HAPPY 
SHE'S A HAPPY PERSON ANYWAY IT'S NEVER 
SHE'S NEVER REALLY DOWN 
SHE'S LIKE VERY BUBBLY AND HAPPY MOST OF THE TIME 
YOU JUST WANT THE BEST FOR YOUR CHILDREN 
AND HER STEPFATHER STEVE DOESN'T MIND EITHER NOR DOES HER BOYFRIEND 
CHELSEA'S ALREADY A WAG 
CAMERA SHY MARC WILSON PLAYS FOR PORTSMOUTH 
AND LIVES WITH CHELSEA IN HER FAMILY HOME 
I MENTIONED IT TO HIM ONE DAY 
I WAS LIKE WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ME WANTING 
TO DO MODELLING LIKE PAGE THREE STUFF 
AND HE WAS LIKE 
OH IF YOU WANT TO GET YOUR BOOBS OUT FOR A LIVING IT'S UP TO YOU 
WHICH WAS QUITE OF A SHOCK 
COS I DIDN'T REALLY EXPECT IT TO BE PUT THAT WAY BUT 
YEAH BUT HE SAID AFTERWARDS LIKE 
YOU KNOW ALL GUYS WOULD LIKE TO BE GOING OUT WITH A GLAMOUR MODEL 
CHELSEA'S BEEN MODELLING FOR TWELVE YEARS 
ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS FOR HIGH STREET STORES 
KIDS' MAGAZINES AND CATALOGUES COULD EASILY EARN HER UP TO THREE HUNDRED A DAY 
ASDA MAGAZINE 
THAT'S REALLY CHEESY AS WELL 
THAT WAS FOR TESCO'S THAT ONE 
I'M HER 
THE MODELLING ALL BEGAN WHEN I WAS SIX 
MY MUM SENT SOME PICTURES OFF TO AN AGENCY AND THEY TOOK ME ON 
AND THEN IT JUST STARTED FROM THERE 
THIS WAS MISS HALLOWEEN 
THAT WAS A GOOD FUN DAY 
AND THAT WAS FOR AVON THAT WAS AN AVON BROCHURE 
I WAS FIFTEEN AND I DID THE THREE STEPS TO CLEAR AND CLEAN SKIN 
WITH HER TEEN MODELLING CAREER ALMOST OVER 
AND NOT TALL ENOUGH FOR THE CATWALK 
CHELSEA'S TRYING TO SECURE HER FUTURE WITH WHAT ASSETS SHE HAS 
THE ONE THING THAT'S HOLDING ME BACK FROM GLAMOUR MODELLING AT THE MINUTE 
IS MY AGE 
SO I'VE GOT TO WAIT ABOUT TWO AND A HALF MONTHS AND THEN I'LL BE EIGHTEEN 
BUT I I I BELIEVE IN YOU 
I BELIEVE IN YOU 
LONDON'S THE COUNTRY'S GLAMOUR CAPITAL 
AND TODAY CHELSEA'S AUDITIONING FOR WHAT COULD BE HER LAST ASSIGNMENT ON WHICH SHE'LL BE FULLY CLOTHED 
IT'S A JOB FOR BLISS MAGAZINE 
WHICH IS AIMED AT THIRTEEN TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS 
HELLO HELLO 
I KNOW YOU 
DO YOU CHELSEA CHELSEA YEAH I HAVE MET YOU BEFORE 
YOU CAME TO CASTING WHEN I WAS AT MIZZ 
OH YEAH I DONE THE MIZZ YEAH 
WERE YOU IN MIZZ THEN YEAH 
IT WAS ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO 
I DID THE HALLOWEEN YES HALLOWEEN YEAH 
WHAT SLEEP OVER OR MAIN FASHION 
IT WAS LIKE HALLOWEEN 
IT WAS FEATURES WASN'T IT 
I THINK IT'S IN THERE ACTUALLY HOW FUNNY 
HOW OLD ARE YOU I'M EIGHTEEN IN A MONTH'S TIME 
O. K. 
WE'RE CASTING TODAY FOR OUR FEATURE SHOOTS 
SO WE WOULD WANT YOU TO BE LIKE 
KISSING ANOTHER GUY STUFF LIKE THAT WOULD YOU BE UP FOR THAT 
YEAH THAT'S FINE 
WE WERE JUST HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW ALL THESE MIZZ MODELS 
HAVE GROWN UP SO MUCH AND MOVED ON TO BLISS AND THEN YOU COME IN 
THANKS FOR COMING IN NO PROBLEM 
THANK YOU NICE TO MEET YOU 
I THINK IT WENT O. K. 
THEY NEVER REALLY GIVE ANYTHING AWAY 
AND I JUST FORGET ABOUT IT AFTER BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO 
YOU CAN'T YOU'D BE LIVING ON YOUR NERVES IF YOU 
EVERY NIGHT YOU'RE JUST THINKING OH THEY HAVEN'T CALLED ME YET THEY HAVEN'T CALLED ME YET 
AND THEY WON'T EVER CALL YOU UNLESS YOU'VE GOT IT 
SO UNLESS YOU'VE GOT IT THAT'S WHEN YOU'LL ONLY FIND OUT 
BUT I'VE BEEN ON CASTINGS AND NOT HEARD ANYTHING FOR TWO WEEKS 
AND I THINK I DEFINITELY DIDN'T GET THAT ONE 
AND THEN THEY RING UP AND SAY YOU GOT THE JOB 
SO IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE THE NEXT DAY 
CHELSEA DOESN'T GET MANY MODELLING JOBS THESE DAYS 
AND DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER FULL TIME WORK 
HER OFFICE IS THE GYM 
I GO TO THE GYM EVERY DAY 
IT'S NOT AS GLAMOROUS AS IT ALL SOUNDS 
PEOPLE DON'T REALISE ALL THE HARD WORK THAT GOES BEHIND THE SCENES 
LIKE HAVING TO GO TO THE GYM ALL THE TIME 
I THINK PEOPLE MIGHT EXPECT THAT YOU JUST LOOK LIKE THAT 
SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE GYM AT ALL AND CAN EAT WHAT THEY LIKE 
BUT I'M JUST NOT THAT LUCKY I WISH I WAS 
I'D LIKE TO LOSE A BIT OF WEIGHT YOU KNOW IT'S JUST MY AGE 
YOUR BODY'S CHANGING AND YOU STILL HAVE LIKE PUPPY FAT 
LAST YEAR I USED TO BE A LOT SKINNIER 
YEAH WE WANT TO GET GOING 
LISTEN TO ME ARE WE GOING TO GET GOING YES YEAH COURSE WE ARE 
O. K. 
AND OVER RIGHT 
YOU CAN JIVE 
HAVING THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE 
LET'S GO 
MOST FASHION AGENCIES WILL ONLY TAKE YOU ON 
IF YOU'RE FIVE EIGHT AT LEAST AND I'M FIVE FIVE FIVE SIX 
SO ALREADY YOU WOULDN'T SEE SOMEONE MY HEIGHT ON THE RUNWAY AT ALL 
YOU CAN'T EVEN DO THE FASHION EVEN IF YOU WANTED TO 
YOUNG AND SWEET ONLY SEVENTEEN 
I DON'T GO OUT VERY MUCH 
YOU CAN'T GO OUT LIKE ALL THE TIME AND STILL LOOK GOOD 
I KNOW IT'S REALLY APPROACHING MY EIGHTEENTH NOW 
YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO GET YOUR HEAD DOWN IF THAT'S WHAT YOU REALLY WANT 
I'VE WAITED YOU KNOW 
EVERYTHING'S BEEN ON HOLD SO YOU KNOW 
YOU JUST GO FOR IT WHILE YOU'VE GOT THE CHANCE YOU'RE ONLY YOUNG ONCE 
KEEP GOING 
COME ON YOU CAN DO IT 
KEEP SPINNING KEEP GOING WHOO HOO 
COME ON GOOD 
YEAH 
YEAH 
YEAH 
TWO DAYS AFTER HER AUDITION 
AND CHELSEA'S BACK IN LONDON FOR THE BLISS SHOOT 
MAGAZINE MONEY IS QUITE GOOD MONEY 
AGENTS GET TWENTY PER CENT OF EVERYTHING THAT YOU EARN 
AN HOUR'S WORK CAN RANGE FROM ONE HUNDRED AN HOUR TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AN HOUR 
HELLO IS IT TOO EARLY TOO LATE 
COME THROUGH CHELSEA 
HI CHELSEA MY NAME'S VANESSA NICE TO MEET YOU NICE TO MEET YOU 
I'M GOING TO BE DOING YOUR MAKE UP TODAY O. K. 
RIGHT I'VE GOT TWO OUTFITS ON THE GO 
I'M NOT SURE YET BUT WE'LL HAVE A TRY ON YOU 
THE SHOT LIST THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN BY OUR ART EDITOR IS PARTY WEAR 
SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO MOCK UP A SHOT 
OF A GIRL WEARING HER PARTY OUTFIT 
GETTING READY IN THE BATHROOM 
PUTTING THE LIPPY ON AND DOING THOSE FINAL FINISHING TOUCHES 
WE PICKED CHELSEA BECAUSE SHE WAS 
ONE OF OUR TOP MODELS THAT WE SAW ON THE DAY 
WE HAVEN'T HAD A GIRL THAT'S GOT 
REALLY LONG GORGEOUS HAIR LIKE HERS FOR AGES 
AND SHE HAD REAL PERSONALITY 
AND WE THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO THROW HERSELF INTO ANYTHING 
GORGEOUS RIGHT LET'S PLAY WITH ACCESSORIES 
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A MODEL IN A FEATURE SHOOT 
THE THING YOU REALLY THEY REALLY NEED TO HAVE IS 
PERSONALITY AND IT IS REALLY TRUE 
THEY'VE GOT TO BE GORGEOUS THEY'RE A MODEL 
BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT EXPRESSING YOURSELF 
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU HAVE THAT CERTAIN X. FACTOR 
I LOVE THE WHOLE DAY OF THE SHOOT THE HAIR THE MAKE UP THE OUTFITS 
I LOVE IT ALL 
CHELSEA WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN CONSIDERED GOING TOPLESS 
IF SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD GET REGULAR COMMERCIAL WORK THAT PAID WELL 
BUT SHE DOESN'T THINK THAT AT PRESENT IT'S AN OPTION 
GET READY COS HERE I COME 
I'VE DONE ALL THE TEEN MAGAZINES BUT I'M A BIT OLD TO DO THEM NOW 
AND I'M TOO YOUNG TO DO MAGAZINES LIKE 
LIKE SAY COSMOPOLITAN ELLE AND STUFF 
IF I WANT TO CARRY ON MODELLING 
THEN I'VE GOT TO GO DOWN A DIFFERENT LINE AND GLAMOUR IS THAT LINE 
THAT'S IT 
HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU THINK YOU MADE 
I DON'T WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH MONEY I MADE 
IS IT A LOT 
YEAH I'VE DONE QUITE WELL OUT OF IT 
I'M GLAD I GOT INTO IT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ABLE TO 
YOU KNOW TO BUY MYSELF THINGS 
I BOUGHT MY OWN CAR 
AND I BOUGHT MYSELF A HORSE AND A HORSEBOX AND THINGS 
COS I USED TO GO TO ALL THE SHOW JUMPING COMPETITIONS 
AND THEY HAD ALL THE PUSHY MUMS THERE 
THAT WERE JUST PAYING FOR ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING 
THEY HAVE THEIR TRAINERS THREE TIMES A WEEK TEACHING THEM EVERYTHING 
AND I DID IT ALL MYSELF SO I FIND THAT EVEN MORE REWARDING 
LIKE I HAVEN'T JUST BEEN GIVEN IT ON A PLATE 
WHICH I THINK IS GOOD IN A WAY 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW I RESPECT THINGS A LOT 
CHELSEA'S BEEN WITH THE SAME AGENT SINCE SHE WAS SIX 
IF SHE WANTS TO GET INTO THE GLAMOUR INDUSTRY 
SHE'LL HAVE TO PERSUADE AN AGENCY SPECIALISING IN IT TO SIGN HER UP 
AND THAT WON'T BE EASY 
I SENT MY PICTURES OFF TO I. M. M. AND THEN THEY CALLED ME 
THEY SAID WOULD YOU COME IN FOR AN INTERVIEW 
AND BRING YOUR PORTFOLIO ALONG 
I'VE BEEN TO SEE ONE OTHER AGENT SO FAR 
AND THEY'RE VERY LIMITED 
THEY'VE ONLY GOT ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY GIRLS ON THEIR BOOKS 
AND THEY SAID THAT I AM STILL YOUNG 
AND THAT I SHOULD COME BACK IN A YEAR OR SO 
UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS DAY AND AGE 
YOU DON'T NEED A LICENCE TO RUN AN AGENCY 
YOU USED TO UP UNTIL SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AGO 
SO ANYBODY CAN RUN A MODEL AGENCY FROM THEIR KITCHEN SINK 
THERE ARE LOTS OF MICKEY MOUSE AGENCIES OUT THERE 
I'D BE VERY DUBIOUS ABOUT WHO YOU APPROACH 
I WOULD NEVER PART WITH ANY MONEY WHEN IT COMES TO JOINING AN AGENCY 
I WOULD NEVER PAY TO GO ON ANY WEBSITES 
I WOULD NEVER BE SIGNED UP TO AN AGENCY 
THAT DIDN'T AT LEAST ASK TO INTERVIEW YOU OR SEE YOU ERM 
I THINK YOU'VE JUST GOT TO KEEP YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU 
HOW ARE YOU FEELING NOW I'M FEELING FINE 
I'M EXCITED BUT NERVOUS 
HELLO HI THERE

AND ARE YOU WITH ANY AGENCIES AT THE MOMENT 
I'VE BEEN WITH M. O. T. MODELS SINCE I WAS SIX HAVE YOU 
AND ARE YOU STILL WITH M. O. T. OR HAVE YOU 
I HAVEN'T DONE A LOT FOR THE LAST YEAR 
COS I SIMPLY HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN GOING ON THE CASTING 
COS THEY'RE THEY GET A LOT OF EDITORIAL STUFF AT THE MINUTE 
WHICH IS NOT SUITABLE FOR YOU NO I HAVEN'T GOT THE HEIGHT 
APART FROM THE CHILD STUFF HAVE YOU DONE ANY COMMISSIONED WORK 
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OR BEEN PUBLISHED ANYWHERE NO O. K. 
WHAT'S YOUR GRAND MASTER PLAN 
WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF IN A COUPLE OF YEARS

TO GIVE YOU SOME INDICATION 
I'VE GOT QUITE A FEW GIRLS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO YOU

SO IF I'VE GOT GIRLS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO YOU 
COULD MY TIME PERHAPS BE BETTER SPENT ELSEWHERE 
ALL RIGHT DARLING THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING IN

IT'S LIKE IN AND OUT 
HOW DO YOU THINK IT WENT I DON'T KNOW 
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WENT 
UM I DUNNO WE'LL SEE ON MONDAY 
NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN I THINK THAT IF THE GIRL'S MADE THE EFFORT 
TO WRITE TO AN AGENCY THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY SERIOUS 
AND IF WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE 
I'D RATHER GIVE THEM FIVE MINUTES OF MY TIME AND BE SURE 
THAN PERHAPS LET A LITTLE WINNER SLIP THROUGH THE NET 
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY PHOTOGENIC SHE'S ATTRACTIVE 
SHE'S GOT A NICE PERSONALITY 
BUT SHE'S JUST A BIT GENERIC FOR US I THINK SHE'S GOING TO STRUGGLE 
WE GET LOTS OF GIRLS EVERY WEEK WRITING INTO US 
THAT ARE VERY SIMILAR TO CHELSEA UNFORTUNATELY NOWADAYS 
YOU NEED SOMETHING TO SET YOU APART FROM THE REST 
I AM BEAUTIFUL IN EVERY SINGLE WAY 
YES WORDS CAN'T BRING ME DOWN 
OH NO 
SO DON'T YOU BRING ME DOWN TODAY 
M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. 
LIKE MOST ASPIRING MODELS 
CHELSEA KNOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF NETWORKING SO SHE'S CREATED A PROFILE 
ON MYSPACE HOPING TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF AGENTS 
OR PHOTOGRAPHERS 
BUT IT'S EXPOSED HER TO THE SEEDIER SIDE OF THE WEB 
I'VE HAD SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN HITS ON MY PROFILE 
NINETY NINE PER CENT OF MY MESSAGES ARE FROM MEN 
YOU DO GET GUYS MESSAGING YOU RUDE THINGS 
AND YOU JUST YOU KNOW DELETE 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO STOP IT 
SO YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO GO ON 
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO KEEP THAT OUT OF YOUR MIND 
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO FACE THEM YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE THEM 
THEY'RE ONLY LOOKING AT A PICTURE 
SO I WOULDN'T PERSONALLY BE THAT BOTHERED ABOUT IT 
IT'S NOT JUST CHELSEA'S MAILBOX THAT'S FULL 
ALAN STRUTT IS THE U. K.'S LEADING GLAMOUR PHOTOGRAPHER 
WITH TWENTY YEARS' EXPERIENCE 
HE'S WELL KNOWN AND RESPECTED IN THE INDUSTRY 
AND HE IS THE PHOTOGRAPHER OF CHOICE FOR MANY OF THE TOP GLAMOUR MODELS 
HE'S BECOME AWARE THAT MORE AND MORE YOUNGER GIRLS 
ARE POSTING PICTURES OF THEMSELVES ON PROFESSIONAL WEBSITES 
WE'VE GOT A GIRL HERE WHO'S THIRTEEN FROM NORWICH 
ONE OF THE PICTURES ON HERE SHE'S GOT HER FINGER IN HER MOUTH 
SHE'S GOT HER BELLY EXPOSED SHE'S WEARING LITTLE SHORTS 
SHE'S KIND OF APING A GLAMOUR MODEL TYPE 
YOU KNOW PIN UP POSE BUT SHE'S THIRTEEN YEARS OLD 
YOU CAN SEE SHE'S IN HER BEDROOM 
POTENTIALLY SOMEBODY COULD E. MAIL HER 
SAYS I'M SO AND SO PHOTOGRAPHER 
WITH SOME PICTURES THAT HE COULD HAVE JUST PULLED OFF THE INTERNET 
WHO KNOWS WHO TOOK THEM SAYS 
I'VE GOT SOME MODELLING WORK FOR YOU MEET ME AT SO AND SO STUDIO 
SHE MAY THINK I WON'T TELL MY PARENTS THEY MAY NOT LET ME GO 
I KNOW I'LL GO DOWN THERE 
AND THAT'S WHERE THE BIG DANGER IS 
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO CONTROL THERE 
SO WE'VE GOT ANOTHER GIRL HERE FROM NORTHAMPTON WHO'S FOURTEEN 
AND SHE'S LISTED THAT SHE WANTS TO DO G. LAMOUR AND LINGERIE 
AT FOURTEEN YEARS OLD 
WEBSITES ARE INCREDIBLY HARD TO POLICE 
BUT UNTIL THEY ARE YOUNG GIRLS LIKE THESE ARE VULNERABLE 
TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME 
STILL HOPING TO GO TOPLESS AFTER HER BIRTHDAY IN A MONTH'S TIME 
CHELSEA'S OFF TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF SOMEONE WHO DID AND MADE IT BIG 
HELLO IS THAT JO YES 
HI I'M HERE TO SEE YOU COME UP O. K. 
NICE TO MEET YOU I'M CHELSEA I'M JO 
RETIRED MODEL JO HICKS IS NOW A MAKE UP ARTIST FOR JEANY SAVAGE 
JEANY TAKES ALL THE TOPLESS PHOTOS FOR THE DAILY STAR 
AND WHAT AGE DID YOU START MODELLING 
I STARTED MODELLING WHEN I WAS NINETEEN 
IS THAT WHEN YOU STARTED PAGE THREE 
YEAH I WANTED TO DO FASHION MODELLING AT FIRST 
BUT THEN I KIND OF REALISED WHEN I CAME TO LONDON AND SAW SOME AGENCIES 
THAT I HAD TO BE ABOVE FIVE EIGHT 
AND AS I WAS ONLY FIVE THREE IT WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN 
AND A FEW PEOPLE GAVE ME A FEW HOME TRUTHS AND SAID YOU KNOW 
IF YOU WANT TO MODEL THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IS GLAMOUR 
TOOK A BIT OF PERSUADING BUT ONCE I'D MET THE GIRLS IN THE INDUSTRY 
I REALISED THEY WERE LOVELY DECENT GIRLS 
THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SCARED ABOUT 
DID YOU SEND PICTURES OFF TO THE NEWSPAPERS 
HOW DID IT COME ABOUT YOU GETTING ON TO IT 
BY ENTERING A. BAYWATCH LOOKALIKE COMPETITION IN THE SUN NEWSPAPER 
AND THEY JUST CALLED ME UP AND BROUGHT ME DOWN TO LONDON 
DID A TEST SHOOT WITH ME AND THERE I WAS IN MY RED SWIMSUIT 
BUT IT LED ON TO ME GOING TO SEE AGENCIES 
AND GETTING INTO GLAMOUR PROPERLY O. K. 
DO YOU THINK I HAVE MORE OF A THE DAILY STAR LOOK OR THE SUN LOOK 
TO ME ALL THE GIRLS IN BOTH PAPERS ARE 
YOU KNOW THE SAME KIND OF STANDARD 
BUT YOU'VE DEFINITELY GOT A GREAT GIRL NEXT DOOR PAGE THREE LOOK 
I THINK PERSONALLY THAT'S WHAT I REALLY WANT TO DO 
I'VE GOT THE TIME AND THEN I'VE GOT TO SEE IF I GET A TEST SHOOT FIRST 
YEAH SO YOU SHOULD MAYBE HAVE A CHAT WITH JEANY WHILE YOU'RE HERE 
JEANY WHAT 
SHE JUST WANTS TO ASK YOU ABOUT WHETHER SHE COULD DO A TEST 
YEAH LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR BOOK 
I LEFT MY PORTFOLIO AT HOME 
I STAYED AT MY BOYFRIEND'S LAST NIGHT 
I'VE GOT ONE PICTURE BUT IT'S NOT VERY GOOD QUALITY 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR BOOBS DARLING 
TURN TO THE SIDE OOH NICE LITTLE BOOBS 
TURN TO THE SIDE DARLING 
NICE AREN'T THEY YEAH NICE LITTLE BOOBS LOVELY 
YEAH WE'LL USE YOU 
YOU'RE EIGHTEEN NEXT MONTH YEAH CAN'T USE YOU TILL YOU'RE EIGHTEEN 
YEP I KNOW THAT GIVE ME A CALL IN FEBRUARY YEAH YEAH 
AND THEN WE'LL FIT YOU IN THEN 
JUST REMIND JEANY WHEN YOU MET HER AND SHE'LL GET YOU IN YEAH 
HELLO MUM YOU ALL RIGHT 
I'VE JUST MET JO AND JEANY AND I'VE GOT A TEST FOR THE STAR 
YEAH 
I KNOW 
I'M GOING TO BE DOWN THAT GYM EVERY DAY 
AND I'M JUST GONNA JUST BE 
JUST SO JUST SO FOCUSED AND THAT 
COS I REALLY REALLY REALLY WANT TO MAKE IT 
JEANY SAVAGE WAS THE U. K.'S FIRST FEMALE TOPLESS PHOTOGRAPHER 
AND HAS BEEN TAKING GLAMOUR PICTURES FOR TEN YEARS 
SHE KNOWS HOW DESPERATE GIRLS ARE TO BECOME STAR BABES 
WHEN THEY DO START OFF IN THE INDUSTRY 
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF WHO THEY GO AND SEE 
THERE ARE SOME DODGY PHOTOGRAPHERS OUT THERE 
THAT WILL TAKE THEIR PICTURES TOPLESS 
SHOWING THEIR BUM 
AND SHE'LL GET NO MONEY AND SHE'LL GO OFF AND NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN 
AND SUDDENLY HER PICTURES POP UP 
IN SOME PORNO MAGAZINE IN BLOODY AMSTERDAM OR SOMEWHERE 
AND SHE'LL NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY OF ANY POUNDS 
AND THAT'S TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A GIRL 
AS FAR AS CHELSEA GOES WHEN SHE COMES IN 
IF I DO A TEST OF HER WE'LL SEE HOW SHE PERFORMS IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA 
AND TAKE IT FROM THERE 
YEAH SHE'S SWEET SHE'S VERY SWEET AND SHE'S GOT HER OWN BOOBS 
AND YOU KNOW WE'LL GET HER ON PAGE THREE HOPEFULLY 
AND THEN SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
BUT THE THRILL OF BEING PROMISED A PHOTO SHOOT WITH THE DAILY STAR WAS QUICKLY SHATTERED 
CHELSEA HAD FOUND SOMETHING 
THAT COULD DESTROY HER CAREER AND HER LIFE OVERNIGHT 
I DISCOVERED TWO LUMPS IN MY BREAST ABOUT 
TWO ABOUT TWO NEARLY TWO WEEKS AGO NOW 
THEN I WENT TO THE DOCTOR'S AND GOT IT CHECKED OUT 
I WENT A COUPLE OF TIMES THEN THEY SENT ME TO HOSPITAL 
TO GET BLOOD TESTS DONE 
AND THEN YEAH SO I GET MY RESULTS BACK TODAY 
EVERYONE KEEPS SAYING THAT I'M YOUNG 
SO I SHOULDN'T REALLY BE WORRYING OR ANYTHING 
BUT YEAH I AM A BIT WORRIED COS YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS REALLY 
OOH OOH THEY FADE TO GREY 
OOH OOH THEY FADE TO GREY 
HER MUM MICHELLE WAITED ANXIOUSLY AT HOME 
NO I DIDN'T LET HER KNOW THAT I WAS WORRIED 
IF SHE THOUGHT I WAS UPSET SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN PANICKING 
SO I DIDN'T LET HER KNOW 
I JUST KEPT SAYING IT'S NOTHING CHELS IT'S NOTHING 
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY SHE'S 
COS SHE KNEW THAT I WAS CALM THAT'S WHY SHE'S BEEN CALM 
OTHERWISE IF SHE'D HAVE SEEN ME UPSET THAT WOULD'VE 
CHELSEA WOULD HAVE BEEN WORRIED 
I'LL RING MY MUM FIRST 
COS SHE WAS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IT 
I THINK SHE WAS MORE WORRIED THAN ME 
HELLO 
YEAH JUST COME OUT IT WENT WELL 
YEAH HE SAID THAT IT'S JUST A CYST 
A CYST AND THEY SHOULD GO DOWN AND HE HAD THE 
THE BLOOD TESTS WERE ALL FINE EVERYTHING ELSE IS O. K. 
YEAH 
YEAH IT'S GOOD NEWS 
I'M SO GLAD I WENT FOR THAT 
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT CHELSEA ALL LAST WEEK 
AND I HAD BEEN CRYING AND I DIDN'T LET CHELSEA KNOW 
I KNOW I HAD BEEN CRYING 
AND I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'D BEEN WORRIED ABOUT YOU 
AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO KEEP A BRAVE FACE 
AND IT'S MADE ME SO ILL ALL WEEKEND WORRYING ABOUT IT 
AND I WOULD RATHER HAVE HAD THE LUMPS THAN YOU CHELS 
BUT I'M SO RELIEVED THAT EVERYTHING'S O. K. NOW 
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT 
AND I THOUGHT YOU WAS KEEPING IT IN SO I DIDN'T WORRY 
I KNOW I GOT REALLY UPSET YESTERDAY 
OH WHAT A RELIEF 
I'VE GOT DRY LIPS 
COS I AM SUPERWOMAN 
YES I AM 
YES SHE IS 
HAVING OVERCOME HER HEALTH SCARE CHELSEA HAD MORE GOOD NEWS 
AN INVITATION TO MEET THE SUN'S PAGE THREE PHOTOGRAPHER ALISON WEBSTER 
WHAT CHELSEA DIDN'T KNOW WAS THAT HER IDOL KEELEY HAZELL 
WOULD BE DOING A PHOTO SHOOT AT THE STUDIO 
CHELSEA YOU'VE COME ON YOUR OWN YEAH 
YOU'VE NOT COME WITH ANYTHING NO MUM OR ANYTHING NO 
NO HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO PROVE YOUR AGE 
YEAH I'VE GOT MY DRIVING LICENCE 
AND WHEN ARE YOU EIGHTEEN ERM JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTH 
OH THAT'S MY SECOND JANUARY PERSON CAN I HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR 
O. K. JUST TWO SECONDS WHILE I JUST GO AND FIND MY GLASSES 
WHICH HAVE FALLEN OFF MY HEAD 
YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING BUT APPARENTLY KEELEY'S IN THERE 
SHE'S ABSOLUTELY STUNNING AND SHE'S DONE REALLY WELL 
SHE WON PAGE THREE IDOL 
I'D ABSOLUTELY LOVE TO MEET HER 
JUST SEE WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE IN THE ACTUAL FLESH AS WELL 
KEELEY'S MANAGEMENT CONTROL HER IMAGE SO TIGHTLY 
WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO FILM HER 
ALL RIGHT THEN 
IF YOU SEE HER YEAH I PROBABLY WILL 
ALL RIGHT THEN BABES THANKS A LOT BYE 
SPEAK TO YOU SOON 
ERM THAT WAS KEELEY I THINK SHE'S ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
SHE'S DONE REALLY WELL FOR HERSELF 
THERE'S THIS SORT OF PERCEPTION BY PEOPLE OF YOUR AGE 
THAT YOU MAKE A LOT OF MONEY 
YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE YOUNG FOOTBALLERS FALLING AT YOUR FEET 
AND YOU BUY YOURSELF A LOAD OF HOUSES IN CANARY WHARF 
AND YOU DRIVE AROUND IN A VERY FLASH MERCEDES OR SOMETHING 
BUT REALLY THERE'S KIND OF ONE THAT'S GOT TO THAT STAGE 
AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S KEELEY 
YEAH MOST OF THE OTHERS HAVE A SORT OF REASONABLE LIFESTYLE 
BUT IT'S A REALLY HARD PROFESSION 
AND IT'S OVER BY THE TIME YOU'RE TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX M. M. M. 
TO SEE IF CHELSEA HAD ANY POTENTIAL 
ALISON OFFERED TO TAKE SOME PICTURES OF HER 
IF YOU GO THROUGH INTO THAT LITTLE ROOM THERE CHELSEA O. K. 
HAVE YOU BROUGHT ANYTHING TO WEAR OR HAVE YOU 
NO I DIDN'T THINK I WAS DOING ANY SHOOTING TODAY 
DO YOU WANT TO TRY THAT YEAH 
THERE'S ANOTHER SWIMSUIT THERE CHELSEA 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN LOOK UP 
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT PHOTOGRAPH 
MUCH BETTER THAN THEY LOOK OR 
THERE'S PEOPLE THAT LOOK FANTASTIC IN REAL LIFE 
AND DON'T PHOTOGRAPH THAT WELL 
SO IT'S JUST 
IT'S JUST REALLY TO GET AN IDEA 
COS THERE'S NO POINT DOING ANYTHING TOO IN DEPTH 
BECAUSE UNTIL I SEE WHAT HER BOOBS ARE LIKE 
THERE'S JUST NO POINT YOU KNOW 
FIRST AND FOREMOST IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE A PAGE THREE GIRL 
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE GREAT BOOBS 
IF YOU GO AND STAND ON THE 
IF ALISON LIKES THE PHOTOS SHE'LL INVITE CHELSEA BACK 
FOR A TOPLESS SHOOT WHEN SHE TURNS EIGHTEEN 
AND THEN JUST BEHIND YOUR NECK WHERE YOU'VE TIED YOUR BOW YEAH 
YEAH IS THAT O. K. YEAH BETTER 
AND SHOULDERS TO ME 
LOVELY 
O. K. STRETCH YOUR BODY DARLING 
LOVELY O. K. 
DO YOU WANT TO JUST QUICKLY PUT ONE OF THE SWIMSUITS ON 
SO THAT I CAN COS THAT'S VERY GOOD AT 
SQUASHING EVERYTHING TOGETHER 
I THINK IT'S THIS WHOLE CULTURE THAT WE LIVE IN NOW OF CELEBRITY 
WHERE EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE FAMOUS 
AND THEY THINK THIS IS AN EASY ROUTE INTO FAME 
BUT LET ME TELL YOU IT'S JUST NOT EASY AT ALL 
WHEN YOU'VE GOT NOTHING ON EXCEPT A PAIR OF TINY KNICKERS 
YOU ARE OPEN TO ANYTHING YOU KNOW 
YOU'RE INVITING AS MUCH ADULATION AS YOU ARE CRITICISM 
AND ERM 
YOU'VE GOT NOWHERE TO HIDE 
YOU CAN'T BE SHY YOU CAN'T BE SELF CONSCIOUS 
EVEN IF IT'S THAT TIME OF THE MONTH SORT OF THING YOU CAN'T 
THERE'S JUST NOWHERE TO HIDE AND NOTHING TO HIDE BEHIND SO 
IT'S A HARD JOB AND VERY VERY VERY FEW PEOPLE MAKE IT 
VERY FEW 
YOU JUST LOOK QUITE NICE 
LOOK DOWN 
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID TO ME 
IT'S ALL VERY WELL YOU SITTING THERE 
YOU'RE MAKING MONEY OUT OF THESE PEOPLE THEY'RE ONLY YOUNG GIRLS 
AND THAT SORT OF THING 
BUT THAT'S THE FAMOUS LINE WOULD YOU LET YOUR DAUGHTER DO IT 
WELL YES ACTUALLY I DID LET MY DAUGHTER DO IT 
AND SHE DID DO IT FOR WHILE 
O. K. LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
NOW THE SUN HAVE A HUGE THING ABOUT NOT PUTTING YOUR FINGERS DOWN YOUR KNICKERS 
IT'S JUST ONE OF THEIR THINGS THAT THEY DON'T LIKE 
GOOD GIRL 
SMILE CHELSEA 
JUST TRY AND RELAX DARLING 
PUT YOUR SHOULDERS DOWN AND CHIN UP 
THAT'S IT LOVELY 
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A LOOK AT THIS AND SEE IF IT 
COOL 
I KNOW I'VE GOT A GOOD HALF STONE TO LOSE 
COS I WENT ON THE PILL AND I PUT IT ON 
SO THAT'S WHERE A SWIMSUIT WORKS AND A BIKINI DOESN'T HEY YEAH 
YOU COULD PROBABLY LOSE AS YOU SAY A FEW POUNDS 
BUT I WOULDN'T GO HEAVIER THAN THAT 
BECAUSE YOU'LL LOSE YOUR BOOBS IF YOU DO O. K. 
BUT IT IS ALL REALLY MORE ABOUT TONING UP THAN ANYTHING ELSE 
O. K. DO YOU WANT TO GET SOME CLOTHES ON 
AND THEN YOU'RE DONE JANE THANK YOU 
SHE NEEDS TO GAIN CONFIDENCE 
SHE'S STILL VERY NERVOUS SHE CAN'T SMILE AT THE MOMENT 
SHE'S KIND OF STILL 
AS MOST PEOPLE IN UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATIONS A BIT YOU KNOW 
BUT THAT'LL COME AGAIN WITH TIME HOPEFULLY 
AND HOPEFULLY WHEN IT DOES SHE'S GOT A NICE SMILE 
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD I WAS QUITE NERVOUS 
BUT I'M REALLY EXCITED NOW I'M REALLY HOT 
OUR STANDARDS ARE SO HIGH 
THAT AND I'M NOT SAYING SHE WON'T MAKE IT 
I'M JUST SAYING MY SUSPICION IS THAT SHE PROBABLY WILL STRUGGLE 
LIFE DOESN'T ALWAYS GO MY WAY 
YEAH 
SHE SAID THAT YOU KNOW IS IT SURE THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO BE DOING 
COS IT IS A TOUGH BUSINESS AND YEAH IT DIDN'T PUT ME OFF 
I THINK IT JUST MAKES ME WANT IT EVEN MORE 
SO YEAH I THINK IT JUST MAKES ME WANT IT EVEN MORE NOW 
I'M NOT A GIRL 
NOT YET A WOMAN 
ALL I NEED IS TIME 
A MOMENT THAT IS MINE 
WHILE I'M IN BETWEEN 
I'M NOT A GIRL 
ANOTHER DAY AND ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPHER 
BOTH HANDS THAT'S GOOD LEAN FORWARD OFF THE HIPS 
ANDY LESAUVAGE WAS A COMMERCIAL PHOTOGRAPHER 
BUT ALSO STARTED SHOOTING GLAMOUR MODELS SEVEN YEARS AGO 
NICE ONE PERFECT LEAN FORWARD TOWARDS THE CAMERA 
LEAN FORWARD LEAN FORWARD GOOD AND SMILE GOOD 
PERFECT 
YES CAN I HAVE A LOOK IN THE BOX 
YES HAVE A LOOK IN THE BOX HI LOVE HOW ARE YOU DOING 
HELLO NICE TO MEET YOU I'M CHELSEA 
YOU CAN WATCH WHAT WE DO IN THE STUDIO 
IF YOU'VE GOT ANY QUESTIONS 
ARE YOU LOOKING TO GO INTO GLAMOUR MODELLING YEAH YEAH 
I'VE BEEN ASKING AROUND FOR ADVICE AND STUFF COS I TURN EIGHTEEN NEXT MONTH 
OH YOU'RE ONLY SEVENTEEN YEAH RIGHT O. K. YES 
SO YEAH JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENS YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING EIGHTEEN 
YEAH I CAN'T WAIT 
THIS IS LARISSA HELLO NICE TO MEET YOU HOW ARE YOU 
SHE'S BEEN IN WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN IN 
NUTS ZOO MAXIM PLAYBOY 
AND HOW HARD DO YOU THINK IT WAS TO GET INTO IT 
TO GET LIKE PUBLISHED AND THAT 
VERY HARD 
I DID IT THE HARD WAY SO OBVIOUSLY YOU'LL GET LOADS OF TIPS AND STUFF 
BUT IF YOU DO IT THE RIGHT WAY 
WHICH IS THE EASY WAY 
YOU SHOULD BE IN IT STRAIGHT AWAY 
WHAT WAS THE WRONG WAY SHOOTING WITH EVERYBODY AND ANYBODY 
MAKING A QUICK LIKE TEN 
I TOOK LIKE ONE THOUSAND 
YOU CAN END UP FLOODING YOURSELF EVERYWHERE AND ANYWHERE 
COS YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME GETTING IN LOADS OF MAGAZINES 
SO THE IDEA IS TO DO IT SLOWLY WORK WITH ONE GOOD PHOTOGRAPHER 
AND DO IT STEADILY AND GET PEOPLE COMING TO YOU 
RATHER THAN YOU GOING TO EVERYBODY ELSE 
THAT WAY YOU BECOME EXCLUSIVE THAT'S THE TIP I'D GIVE YOU THANK YOU 
THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL THE THING IS THE LESS PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH 
THE MORE VALUABLE YOU'LL BE 
IS THAT WHAT KEELEY DID JUST WORKED WITH ALAN 
EXACTLY SHE'S ONLY WORKED WITH 
I RECKON IT'S ONLY PROBABLY ABOUT SIX PHOTOGRAPHERS BUT EVERYTHING'S CONTROLLED 
HER MANAGEMENT CONTROL HER LIKE THAT WHICH IS BRILLIANT 
THAT'S WHY SHE MAKES MONEY 
WHEN WAS THE FIRST TIME YOU WENT TOPLESS 
I WENT TOPLESS STRAIGHT AWAY 
BUT I KNEW WHAT I WANTED TO DO I DON'T WANT TO DO COMMERCIAL AT ALL 
I DEFINITELY WANT TO KEEP DOING GLAMOUR 
SO I HAD NO YOU KNOW SHOULD I SHOULDN'T I 
ABOUT GOING TOPLESS STRAIGHT AWAY 
SO AS LONG AS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO 
AND YOU DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO DO COMMERCIAL LIKE EVER 
YOU'LL BE FINE O. K. BUT MAKE SURE 
LOOK AT THE BODY SHAPES THERE PERFECT GOOD 
GOOD GREAT SHAPE PERFECT THAT'S GREAT 
CARA DO YOU THINK THERE'S ENOUGH WORK AROUND IN THE INDUSTRY 
UM YEAH THE MAGAZINES LOVE NEW GIRLS 
YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN GET A MAGAZINE BEHIND YOU IT'S BRILLIANT 
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT YOU WANT FAME 
I WOULDN'T MIND FAME BUT FAME IS MONEY ISN'T IT 
I WANT TO MAKE MONEY 
I DON'T WANT TO COME INTO THE INDUSTRY JUST COS I WANT PHOTOS 
I'VE HAD ENOUGH PHOTOS TAKEN 
I WANT TO MAKE A GOOD LIVING 
TO BE FAMOUS AND BE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MODEL OUT THERE 
I WOULDN'T MIND THAT YEAH 
ARE YOU READY FOR A QUICK BLAST YEAH SHALL I DO IT LIKE THIS 
YOU CAN DO BUT I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO BE A GLAMOUR MODEL NOW 
I'M ASKING YOU TO BE A MODEL TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE LIKE AT MOVING O. K. 
JUST MODELLING YEAH 
SEE WHAT YOU'RE LIKE AT MOVING HOW YOU FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS AND SEE WHAT YOU'RE LIKE 
NICE ONE HAND OUT OF YOUR POCKET NOW 
GOOD EVERY SHOT DIFFERENT PERFECT CHANGE THAT GOOD HEAD UP HIGH 
GOOD OPEN YOUR MOUTH A TAD BEAUTIFUL 
OPEN YOUR MOUTH 
GOOD BIG LAUGH HA HA THAT'S GREAT MORE LAUGHING GO ON 
CHEESY IT'S CHEESY BUT SMILING 
SEE THAT LITTLE TRAIT YOU'VE GOT SEE THAT ARM'S STRAIGHT OH YEAH 
COULD DO WITH A BIT MORE SHAPE 
COS EVERY SHOT THERE'S ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD RIGHT 
SHE'S DONE BETTER THAN WHAT I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO 
REALLY YEAH BUT WHAT SUITS YOU 
IS THE WAY THE WIND PUSHES YOUR HAIR OFF HERE LIKE THIS TOO YEAH 
BUT YOU ACTUALLY IMPRESSED ME 
REALLY GOOD I'M SURPRISED ACTUALLY 
THAT SHE GOT INTO IT SO FAST 
IT'S BEGINNING TO DAWN ON CHELSEA 
THAT GLAMOUR MODELLING MAY NOT BE AS LUCRATIVE AS SHE THOUGHT 
THAT'S GREAT 
BUT WORSE STILL THE REALISATION THAT IF SHE GOES SEMI NAKED 
SHE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RETURN TO COMMERCIAL MODELLING 
THAT'S NICE GREAT SHOT 
SO WHAT WOULD YOUR ADVICE BE 
TO GO TOPLESS DO IMPLIED OR NOT DOING IT AT ALL 
THAT'S YOUR DECISION I CAN'T MAKE THAT FOR YOU 
IT'S GOT TO BE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO BUT DON'T LET ANYBODY PUSH YOU 
INTO DOING SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT TO DO 
I SAY HOLD OUT COS IF YOU GOT PAGE THREE FINE 
YOU DO ONE SET OF PHOTOS 
YOU'VE GONE TOPLESS THAT'S IT YOU CAN'T GO BACK 
IF YOU DO A COUPLE OF BITS AND BOBS YOU CAN STILL DO GLAMOUR MODELLING 
WITHOUT SHOWING IT ALL 
THAT'S A HARD DECISION ISN'T IT THAT DECISION'S GOT TO BE YOURS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME 
FOR THE FIRST TIME CHELSEA'S BEGINNING TO HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS 
SILENT NIGHT 
HOLY NIGHT 
TWO MONTHS AGO MY MIND WAS SET ON PAGE THREE 
IT WAS PAGE THREE THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO DO THAT WAS IT 
BUT SINCE THEN I'VE MET A LOT OF PEOPLE 
AND LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE INDUSTRY 
AND THERE'S NOT MANY GIRLS MAKING A VERY GOOD LIVING 
OUT OF GLAMOUR MODELLING 
I THINK I REALLY MADE MY MIND UP WHEN I WENT TO SEE ANDY 
AND I SAW THOSE PICTURES WITH ME WEARING THE JEANS 
AND THEY WERE VERY COMMERCIAL 
I'M NOT GOING TO RULE IT ALL OUT BUT I THINK I'VE JUST GOT WISE 
GOT A BIT WISER IN THE INDUSTRY ABOUT IT ALL 
I DON'T WANT TO LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES BECAUSE IT'S TOO LATE THEN 
M. M. M. 
HERE COME THE GIRLS 
GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS 
WHILE AGONISING OVER HER DECISION 
CHELSEA'S GOT SOME ALTERNATIVE MODELLING WORK 
PROMOTING TRACK DAYS AT THE RACING CAR SHOW IN BIRMINGHAM 
DID YOU WANT TO HAVE A GO 
LOOKING SO PRETTY IS A DOGGONE PITY 
OH LOOKING SO FINE 
YEAH THERE CAN BE A LOT OF MONEY MADE IN PROMOTIONS 
YOU CAN EARN LIKE TWO HUNDRED A DAY 
IT'S A LOT MORE THAN WHAT YOU'D EARN IN AN OFFICE 
BUT IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS MODELLING WORK 
GLAMOUR OBVIOUSLY IS USING YOUR SEXUALITY ERM 
BUT YOU KNOW I DON'T SEE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT IF IT'S TASTEFUL 
IF IT'S NOT TASTEFUL THEN NO 
HOW FAR WOULD YOU BE PREPARED TO GO TOPLESS IS AS FAR AS I WOULD GO 
SHE'S ALREADY PUTTING INTO PRACTICE 
ONE PIECE OF ADVICE SHE'S BEEN GIVEN 
THE PICTURE ON HIS PHONE 
I HAVEN'T BEEN POSING IN FRONT OF THE CAR AND LET LOADS OF PEOPLE 
TAKE PICTURES OF ME TODAY 
BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO CONTROL MY PICTURE CONTROL 
I'VE ONLY SAID YES TO A COUPLE OF PEOPLE 
THAT YOUNG BOY WAS LIKE EIGHT 
AND HE WANTED A PICTURE WITH ME ON HIS PHONE 
SO A COUPLE OF PEOPLE BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE 
WITH REALLY BIG LENS CAMERAS AND THEY START TRYING TO SNAP AWAY 
AND THAT COULD TURN UP IN A DAILY NEWSPAPER AND SO THEY COULD GET TWO HUNDRED 
FOR THE PICTURE AND YOU NOT A PENNY 
IT'S EVERYTHING THAT ALL THE PHOTOGRAPHERS HAVE SAID THAT I'VE TAKEN ON BOARD 
NO PICTURE THANKS SORRY 
IT'S JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE CHELSEA TURNS EIGHTEEN 
AND CAN DECIDE THE DIRECTION SHE WANTS HER MODELLING CAREER TO TAKE 
SHE NOW KNOWS THERE'S A REAL DOWNSIDE TO GLAMOUR 
SO WHERE BETTER TO GO FOR SOME FINAL GUIDANCE THAN TO THE VERY TOP 
TO MEET HER IDOL KEELEY HAZELL AND TOP PHOTOGRAPHER ALAN STRUTT 
HI THERE HELLO 
YOU'RE CHELSEA YEAH HI YEAH ALAN 
AND THIS TIME WE WERE ALLOWED TO FILM THE SHOOT 
HELLO NICE TO MEET YOU NICE TO MEET YOU TOO 
G. L. A M. O. R. O. U. S. YEAH 
G. L. A M. O. R. O. U. S. 
WE'RE FLYING FIRST CLASS 
WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR IN A GLAMOUR MODEL 
ERM TRICKY ONE HER 
I WON'T CHANGE 
BY THE GLAMOROUS 
OOH THE FLOSSY FLOSSY 
THE GLAMOROUS 
THE GLAMOROUS GLAMOROUS 
THE GLAMOROUS 
OOH THE FLOSSY FLOSSY 
THE GLAMOROUS 
THE GLAMOROUS GLAMOROUS 
THE GLAMOROUS 
OOH THE FLOSSY FLOSSY 
WEAR THEM GOLD AND DIAMOND RINGS 
ALL THEM THINGS DON'T MEAN A THING 
BUT CHELSEA WASN'T PREPARED FOR THE WARNING THAT KEELEY WOULD GIVE HER 
OH THANK YOU 
THESE ARE NOT SO RECENT THIS IS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO 
WHY IS IT YOU WANT TO CHANGE OVER FROM DOING MORE CATALOGUES 
INTO THE GLAMOUR SIDE OF IT 
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID WHY DON'T YOU TRY GLAMOUR MODELLING 
AND I THOUGHT THERE COULD BE MORE WORK DOWN THAT ROUTE 
THE ONLY CONCERN I'D HAVE IS THAT IF GOING FROM COMMERCIAL TO GLAMOUR 
THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD GO BACK TO COMMERCIAL 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO EARN A GOOD LIVING FROM COMMERCIAL MODELLING 
THEN I'D ADVISE YOU TO DO THAT 
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT GLAMOUR'S GOING COS THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BE A GLAMOUR MODEL 
THERE IS GIRLS THAT WILL WORK FOR FREE 
IF ONE OF THE MAGAZINES CAN GET A GIRL THAT WILL WORK FOR FREE 
THEY WON'T WANT TO PAY SOMEBODY A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO DO THE JOB 
WHAT I AM FINDING IS THERE'S X. AMOUNT OF GIRLS LIKE MADAM HERE 
EARNING LOTS OF MONEY 
AND THERE'S A MILLION GIRLS THAT AREN'T EARNING ANYTHING 
I'VE BEEN IN SO MANY MAGAZINES AND ALL THE HIGH STREET STORES 
I DON'T WANT TO BE IN A MAGAZINE AND SAY I'M IN A MAGAZINE 
I WANT TO MAKE A LIVING OUT OF IT 
THAT'S IT IT'S KIND OF YOUR DECISION 
IF YOU CROSS OVER AND TRY AND GET INTO IT AND THEN IT KIND OF FAILS 
THE COMMERCIAL SIDE PROBABLY MIGHT BE HARDER TO GET BACK INTO 
WITH KEELEY IN THE INDUSTRY AS THE MOST POPULAR 
GLAMOUR MODEL IF WE CALL HER THAT 
AT THE MOMENT AND HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST YEAR OR TWO 
I HAD A LOOK THE OTHER DAY THEY'RE ALL BUYING HER CALENDAR 
FROM JAPAN FROM KOREA VIETNAM THE STATES CANADA 
I THINK NOWADAYS THERE'S A LOT OF GIRLS 
WHO DO WAKE UP AND SAY THEY WANT TO BE A GLAMOUR MODEL 
BUT I DON'T THINK WHEN I STARTED I WAS NECESSARILY THINKING 
YEAH I WANT TO BE A GLAMOUR MODEL 
AND I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT WHAT IT INVOLVED 
IT'S NOT AS GLAMOROUS AS EVERYBODY THINKS IT IS 
IT'S LONG DAYS 
IT'S VERY COLD MUST OF THE TIME 
SOME OF THE MODELS DON'T EARN ANY MONEY FROM IT 
SO IT'S KIND OF A LOT OF HARD WORK 
THAT I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU 
I LO O. O. O. O. OVE YOU I LOVE YOU 
I LO O. O. O. O. OVE YOU 
I LOVE YOU 
TILL THE DAY I DIE 
THERE WILL NEVER BE A TIME 
WHEN WE HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE 
NICE TO MEET YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD LUCK WITH EVERYTHING 
OH THANK YOU 
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU 
BYE BYE BYE 
THANK YOUS TAKE CARE BYE 
IT'S TRICKY IN THIS COUNTRY COS THEY DO WANT 
NEXT DOOR LOOKING NICE GIRL SO IT COULD WORK WITH HER 
FROM HER PICTURE SHE PHOTOGRAPHS WELL 
HER BODY'S FINE ALL THE REST OF IT 
SO THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH HER AND THERE IS POTENTIAL THERE 
AND THIS IS WHERE WE STARTED BACK IN BOURNEMOUTH ON CHELSEA'S BIRTHDAY 
I'VE GOT A BIG PARTY FOR MY BIRTHDAY 
IT'S AT A REALLY GOOD NIGHTCLUB IN BOURNEMOUTH 
ARE YOU EXCITED CHELSEA YEAH I CAN'T WAIT 
WHATEVER CHELSEA DECIDES TO DO 
I KNOW SHE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND 
I'LL JUST SUPPORT HER WHATEVER SHE WANTS TO DO 
HOW'S YOUR SHOOTING SKILLS 
IF CHELSEA WANTS TO GO AND DO THE TOPLESS 
WE'LL SUPPORT HER ALL THAT WE CAN AND WE'LL HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH IT 
I WANT TO BE EIGHTEEN BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'RE AN ADULT 
WHETHER I CHOOSE COMMERCIAL OR GLAMOUR I'M GOING TO BE 
AN ADULT MODEL EITHER WAY 
AND I JUST THINK YOU GET TAKEN SO MUCH MORE SERIOUSLY AT EIGHTEEN 
YOU CAN VOTE YOU CAN GO TOPLESS 
IT'S CERTAINLY FREEDOM ONCE YOU'RE EIGHTEEN 
LIFE DOES START OFF FOR ME NOW ONE DAY MAKES SUCH A DIFFERENCE 
THE DAY BEFORE YOUR BIRTHDAY YOU CAN'T DO A TOPLESS SHOOT BUT THE NEXT DAY YOU CAN 
TURN YOUR BUM SLIGHTLY MORE TOWARDS ME 
THAT LOOKS NICE 
ONE EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD HAS ACHIEVED HER AMBITION 
BUT IT'S NOT CHELSEA 
GOOD 
JENNY GRANT HAS JUST BEEN VOTED THE SUN'S NEW PAGE THREE IDOL 
ALL MY LIFE I'VE ALWAYS WANTED 
TO DO SOMETHING THAT I'LL ENJOY AND BE SUCCESSFUL IN 
SO I THINK I'VE FOUND IT 
CHELSEA HOWEVER HAS DECIDED NOT TO CALL ALISON AT THE SUN 
OR TO TAKE UP THE OFFER OF A TEST SHOOT WITH JEANY SAVAGE AT THE DAILY STAR 
SHE'S CHOSEN INSTEAD TO KEEP HER CLOTHES ON WEAR OTHER PEOPLE'S 
AND STICK WITH COMMERCIAL MODELLING AT LEAST FOR NOW 
YOU KNOW I DID PLAN 
AS SOON AS I TURNED EIGHTEEN THAT I WANTED TO BE DOING 
PAGE THREE OR DOING A TOPLESS SHOOT WITH ONE OF THE BEST PHOTOGRAPHERS 
BUT YOU KNOW LEARNING FROM THE INDUSTRY I'M THINKING 
OH NO SHALL I DO IT OR NOT 
BECAUSE ONCE THAT TOPLESS PICTURE'S OUT THERE YOU'VE 
IT'S JUST MORE THAN A PICTURE 
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE INNOCENT AND NOT SO WISED UP 
ON THE WHOLE GLAMOUR INDUSTRY IF I HADN'T MET ALL THESE PEOPLE 
TWO MONTHS AGO I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE ENTERED THE GLAMOUR INDUSTRY 
WITH MY EYES SHUT AND AS A NAIVE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD 
BUT NOW I'M GOING TO BE THAT EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD WHO'S SWITCHED ON 
AND KNOWS WHAT SHE WANTS AND WON'T BE WALKED OVER 
SO I THINK THERE IS A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO 
AND ALL SHE WANTS IS LOVE 
AND ALL SHE WANTS IS DUM D. A. D. A. D. A. 
SEARCHING FOR A TOUCH 
THAT'S MORE THAN JUST A DUM D. A. D. A. D. A. 
HIDES BEHIND HER HEART 
AND ALL WE SEE IS DUM D. A. D. A. D. A. 
YOU COULD GIVE HER LOVE LOVE LOVE
