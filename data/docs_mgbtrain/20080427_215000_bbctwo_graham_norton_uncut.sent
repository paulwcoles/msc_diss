THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS SOME STRONG LANGUAGE 
COME ON WHOA OH 
THANK YOU KINDLY 
WELCOME 
WELCOME TO THE SHOW EVERYBODY 
OH IN SUNNY LONDON TOWN 
VERY EXCITING TO BE HERE 
I FEEL LIKE I'VE HARDLY BEEN ON TELEVISION RECENTLY 
DID ANYONE WATCH THE BAFTAS ANYBODY WATCH THE BAFTAS YES 
WELL SOME OF IT NOBODY WATCHED ALL OF IT 
IT WAS RISKY I THOUGHT HAVING IT SPONSORED BY SKY 
A GADGET DESIGNED TO HELP YOU SKIP THE BORING BITS 
WELCOME TO BAFTAS KELLY BROOK OOH THAT'S GAVIN AND STACEY 
WELL DONE BRUCIE GOOD NIGHT 
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU ABOUT MY GUESTS TONIGHT 
WELL FOR SEVEN YEARS SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT ONE OF MY GUESTS 
WAS ACTUALLY IN CHARGE OF AMERICA 
NO 
NOT HIM 
THEY DON'T EVEN LET HIM CUT UP HIS OWN FOOD 
I'M TALKING ABOUT HOLLYWOOD STAR MARTIN SHEEN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
THE MAN WHO WAS THE PRESIDENT IN THE WEST WING 
HE WAS ALSO THE STAR OF APOCALYPSE NOW 
BUT IS PROBABLY BEST KNOWN FOR HIS RANGE OF FURNITURE POLISH 
A LITTLE KNOWN FACT I CAME ACROSS IN MY RESEARCH THERE 
MARTIN NO IN FAIRNESS HE STARRED IN SO MANY CLASSIC FILMS 
BADLANDS WALL STREET CATCH ME IF YOU CAN AND APOCALYPSE NOW 
WHAT A GREAT FILM THAT WAS ABOUT A MAN WHO WENT INTO THE JUNGLE 
LOST HIS MIND AND CAME HOME A HERO 
AND OF COURSE ON TELEVISION MARTIN STARRED AS PRESIDENT BARTLET IN THE WEST WING 
OOH THERE HE IS LOOKS LIKE PRINCE WILLIAM VISITING HIS GIRLFRIEND 
I LOVE THAT STORY DID YOU SEE IT PRINCE WILLIAM USING THE ARMY HELICOPTERS TO VISIT KATE 
HE LANDED ONE ON HER LAWN 
NOW APPARENT 
I HAVEN'T GOT THERE YET 
APPARENTLY IT WAS A SIMULATED TRAINING EXERCISE YEAH 
BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH IRAQ LOOKS LIKE A WELL MANICURED HOME COUNTIES GARDEN DON'T WE 
I TELL YOU IF THERE EVER IS A WAR ON A WELL MOWN LAWN 
WITH TEA LAID OUT AT ONE END REST ASSURED THIS COUNTRY IS READY 
IN FACT YOU COULD SAY THAT WILL'S CHOPPER 
WAS IN KATE'S NEATLY TRIMMED LADY GARDEN 
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING 
HE FUCKED HER 
YEAH RIGHT UP THE WATER FEATURE 
MY OTHER GUEST TONIGHT SAYS HE HATES BEING KNOWN AS JUST THE VOICE OF CARPHONE WAREHOUSE 
SO HE IS A STAND UP COMEDIAN AND THE VOICE OF CARPHONE WAREHOUSE 
ED BYRNE IS HERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN YES HE IS 
ED REALLY MAKES ME LAUGH 
AND IT'S GOOD TO LAUGH ISN'T IT WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH SAD NEWS IN THE WORLD 
FOR EXAMPLE I WAS VERY SAD TO LEARN THAT THIS MAN IS TRAGICALLY BATTLING BULIMIA 
YOU COULDN'T MAKE IT UP COULD YOU 
NO WONDER THE PRICE OF FOOD'S GOING UP HE'S EATEN IT ALL 
NO NO POOR BULIMIC JOHN PRESCOTT 
HIS WIFE SAID SHE FIRST WORRIED ABOUT JOHN WHEN SHE NOTICED FOOD GOING MISSING 
YES AND HIS TROUSER BUTTON SHOT THE CAT 
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT BULIMICS 
WHEN THEY LOOK IN THE MIRROR THEY SEE A FAT PERSON 
YEAH 
ACTUALLY SCIENTISTS HAVE CALCULATED 
HOW JOHN WOULD LOOK IF HE HADN'T THROWN UP ANY OF THE FOOD HE HAD EATEN 
NOT AS BAD AS I THOUGHT 
ANYWAY LET'S MEET MY GUESTS 
LATER WE'LL HAVE MUSIC FROM WILLI.AM AND CHERYL COLE 
BUT FIRST WHAT'S THAT MOWBLI 
IT'S MY FAVOURITE COMEDIAN ED BYRNE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
ED BYRNE 
AND HAIL TO THE CHIEF PLEASE WELCOME THE GREAT MARTIN SHEEN 
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME 
SIT DOWN SIT DOWN 
OH DEAR HOW ARE YOU 
I'M GOOD THANK YOU VERY GOOD AND YOURSELF ED I'M GOOD 
I'M EXCITED I KNOW IT'S MARTIN SHEEN I KNOW 
I WE'LL JUST SIT AND STARE AT YOU FOR A WHILE 
WE WERE ROARING AT THAT POOR BULIMIC PERSON 
NO BECAUSE HE'S A POLITICIAN YES I HEARD 
AND HE WROTE THIS BOOK AND WE'RE EXPECTING SURPRISES AND SECRETS AND WHAT HAVE YOU 
MAYBE AN AFFAIR HERE OR THERE OR FIGHTS AT NUMBER TEN NO ONE SAW THE BULIMIA COMING 
NOBODY SAW THAT ONE COMING 
IT'S YOUR COMMON EVERYDAY GLUTTONY THAT'S WHAT IT IS 
THAT'S WHAT IT IS I CAN IMAGINE HIM STICKING HIS FINGERS DOWN HIS THROAT TO FORCE MORE IN 
OR WHEN HE WENT TO VOMIT HE PUT DOWN CHOCOLATE FINGERS 
OH GOD THE POOR DEVIL I MEAN IT'S OUTRAGEOUS BUT 
IT IS BUT HE'S NICE AND FULL 
POLITICIANS OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF THE WEST WING 
YOU'VE BEEN DRAWN INTO THAT WORLD 
I'M NOT IN THE WEST WING WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
IN TERMS OF POLITICS OF THE MOMENT 
YOU'VE BEEN QUITE VOCAL AS NOT BEING A SUPPORTER OF MR. BUSH 
OH IS THAT WHO HE WAS YES 
WHEN THE WEST WING STARTED WE HAD A DIFFERENT PRESIDENT MR. CLINTON WHO LOVED THE SHOW 
HE WAS A BIG SUPPORTER AND AFTER THE NEW ADMINISTRATION CAME IN 
THE ENTIRE STAFF WAS INVITED TO COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
THEIR COUNTERPARTS COUNTERPARTS ALL BUT ME 
SO I WAS VERY RELIEVED 
AT ONE POINT YOU WROTE A LETTER OF APOLOGY TO BUSH 
I DREW A LOT OF CRITICISM IN A SPEECH I MADE ONE DAY 
BECAUSE I CALLED HIM AN OLD DRUNK 
I APOLOGISED I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT AND I SAID LET'S BE HONEST 
DIDN'T YOU GO ON RECORD AS CALLING HIM A MORON AS WELL 
I DID YES AND I REGRETTED THAT TOO BECAUSE HE'S FAR WORSE 
A BIG MISTAKE ON MY PART 
BECAUSE BUSH HE CAME TO IRELAND YEAH WHY DID HE GO TO IRELAND 
I LEFT JUST TO ANNOY HIM YOU JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE YEAH 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU READ ABOUT THIS HE WENT OVER THERE A FEW YEARS AGO 
AND THERE WAS A BIG DIPLOMATIC FIASCO ABOUT IT BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BRING ARMED SECRET SERVICE MEN WITH HIM 
AND YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE A GUN IN IRELAND UNLESS YOU'RE IN THE SPECIAL BRANCH OR THE ARMY 
OR YOU BOUGHT IT IN A PUB 
SO THERE WAS A BIG THING WE HAVE TO SECOND THE ARMY TO YOU AND THE SPECIAL BRANCH 
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BRING IN YOUR OWN ARMED GUARDS 
IN TYPICAL U. S. DIPLOMATIC FASHION THEY WENT WE DON'T CARE WE'RE BRINGING BLOKES WITH GUNS 
IN TYPICAL IRISH FASHION WE WENT FAIR ENOUGH THEN IN YOU COME 
WELCOME VERY LOVELY MEN WITH VERY LOVELY GUNS BUY SOMETHING GREEN ON YOUR WAY OUT 
YOU'RE NOT SPENDING THAT MUCH TIME IN ENGLAND YOU'RE OFF TO SPAIN 
YES LOVELY THAT'LL BE NICE YOU'RE NOT FLYING OUT OF TERMINAL FIVE ARE YOU I'M NOT NO 
I HEARD ABOUT THAT I WOULD JUST TAKE HAND CARRY ON IF I WAS YOU 
WHICH THEY MAY WELL LOSE AS WELL TO BE BRUTALLY HONEST 
HAVE YOU DONE TERMINAL FIVE YOU HAVEN'T I HAVE YEAH 
WHAT HAPPENED I WAS LUCKY WELL I DIDN'T CHECK IN ANY LUGGAGE 
SO I WASN'T LUCKY I WAS CLEVER 
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU I DON'T REALLY LIKE TO TRAVEL 
I LIKE TO BE IN DIFFERENT PLACES I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE SAY GETTING THERE IS HALF THE FUN 
OH NO YOU MUST HAVE SHIT HOLIDAYS 
IT ALWAYS ANNOYS ME ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU GET 
THEY WANT TO KNOW THE FULL HISTORY OF YOUR BAGS BEFORE THEY LOSE THEM 
DID YOU PACK THESE BAGS YOURSELF NO I HAVE PEOPLE WHO DO THAT FOR ME 
I'M FLYING RYANAIR HOW MANY SERVANTS DO YOU THINK I HAVE 
WELL I HAVE TO SAY IT'S A VERY PROUD WEEK TO BE IN ENGLAND 
VERY GOOD DID EVERYONE HAVE A GOOD SAINT GEORGE'S DAY YESTERDAY 
YES 
I SUPPOSE YOU DID ALL THE USUAL STUFF 
LIKE GOING YEAH IS IT SAINT GEORGE'S DAY 
DO YOU KNOW MUCH ABOUT SAINT GEORGE 
HE'S THE PATRON OF IRE 
OF 
I'M GETTING THAT AS A NO 
IN FAIRNESS NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT SAINT GEORGE THE GREAT DRAGON SLAYER HIMSELF VERY GOOD 
HERE'S A PICTURE OF SAINT GEORGE 
NOW IS IT JUST ME 
OR IS THAT ED WITHOUT THE GLASSES 
VERY STYLISH OBVIOUSLY ARMOUR BY SAINT GEORGE AT ASDA 
TO BE FAIR THOUGH HE DID KILL A FEROCIOUS DRAGON 
YEAH 
I'M NOT SURE HOW HE KILLED IT POSSIBLY MINCED IT TO DEATH 
IT LOOKS MORE LIKE A LABRADOR IN A HALLOWEEN OUTFIT DOESN'T IT 
SAINT GEORGE AND THE SMALL DOG DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME RING TO IT 
NOW OBVIOUSLY BRITAIN'S BEEN EN FETE EN FETE 
AND AS PART OF THE GENERAL EUPHORIA IN CORNWALL IN CORNWALL 
THE LARGEST EVER SCONE WAS MADE 
NOW IS IT JUST ME OR IS SHE GONNA NEED A BIGGER CUP OF TEA THAN THAT 
THAT'S NOT GONNA WASH THAT DOWN 
SHE'LL BE VERY DRY 
MORE TEA 
SO THAT'S THE BIGGEST EVER SCONE 
AND HERE IS THE SAME SCONE FIVE MINUTES LATER 
NOW WE REALLY OUGHT TO TALK ABOUT ACTING 
SINCE YOU'RE HERE AND YOU'RE AN ACTOR 
APOCALYPSE NOW WASN'T YOUR PART AND THEN IT WAS YOU DID GET IT 
I REPLACED HARVEY KEITEL 
HE HAD BEEN FILMING FOR I DON'T KNOW SIX OR EIGHT WEEKS 
AND SOME DIFFERENCES CAME BETWEEN HE AND FRANCIS I UNDERSTAND 
AT ANY RATE THEY JUST DECIDED TO TRY AGAIN WITH A NEW GUY 
AND THAT WAS ME 
THAT WHOLE SHOOT I MEAN IT'S LEGENDARY THAT WHOLE APOCALYPSE NOW SHOOT 
HOW MAD IT WAS IT WAS PRETTY MAD YEAH 
DO YOU REMEMBER A LOT OF IT UNFORTUNATELY I STILL DO YEAH 
FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW I MEAN YOU DID NEARLY DIE DURING IT 
HOW LONG WAS IT BEFORE YOU COULD LAUGH LIKE THAT WHEN PEOPLE MENTIONED IT 
IT WAS A WHILE 
BUT NOT FOR MY WIFE GOD LOVE HER 
SHE CAME TO THE HOSPITAL THEY WERE WHEELING ME DOWN THIS LONG CORRIDOR 
AND SHE LEANED DOWN AND WHISPERED IN MY EAR 
IT'S ONLY A MOVIE BABE 
OH AND I STARTED GETTING WELL RIGHT THEN 
I SWEAR TO GOD SHE SAVED MY LIFE 
WHAT WAS THE THING THAT COPPOLA SAID WHEN SOMEBODY ASKED IS MARTIN SHEEN DEAD 
HE'S NOT DEAD UNTIL I SAY SO 
I KNEW HE HAD A LOT OF POWER BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS GOD 
YOU SAY THERE THAT YOUR WIFE KIND OF MADE YOU WELL AND GOT YOU THROUGH IT 
AND ED BYRNE HE'LL SOON HAVE A WIFE 
YOU'RE ENGAGED YES I'M GETTING MARRIED NEXT MONTH 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN ENGAGED FOR ER A LITTLE OVER A YEAR 
NO EXACTLY A YEAR 
ABOUT A YEAR 
IT'LL BE THIRTEEN MONTHS BY THE TIME WE GET MARRIED 
AND WAS IT ALL TRADITIONAL YOU KNOW RING IN A CHAMPAGNE GLASS TYPE THING 
WELL IT WAS TRADITIONAL IN THAT I REMEMBER TRYING TO GET ONTO THE SUBJECT OF GETTING MARRIED 
I KEPT ON TRYING TO GET THE SUBJECT BACK TO US 
I HAD A VAGUE IDEA OF HOW I WAS GOING TO ASK 
AND SHE'D HAD LIKE THREE GLASSES OF WINE SO EVERY TIME I TRIED TO GET IT ON TO US 
SHE KEPT CHANGING THE SUBJECT 
MOVIES AND MUSIC AND ALL THAT AND I'M TRYING TO TALK ABOUT US 
THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE THE WOMAN IN A RELATIONSHIP 
I FINALLY POPPED THE QUESTION 
AND THIS IS TRUE SHE ACTUALLY SAID NO IN A JOKE 
SHE SAID NO FOR A LAUGH 
A LAUGH 
I GOES I'M ASKING YOU TO MARRY ME AND SHE GOES NO 
I WENT WHAT 
SHE SAID TEARS IN HER EYES I CAN'T MARRY YOU 
AND I WENT OH 
AND SHE WENT ONLY JOKING 
THAT'S NEVER FUNNY THAT'S NEVER FUNNY 
DON'T DO IT SERIOUSLY 
IF ANY LADIES HERE IF YOU MAY GET PROPOSED TO 
AND YOU'RE THINKING OF DOING IT BECAUSE YOU THINK IT'S HILARIOUS I SUGGEST YOU DON'T 
NOT ONLY IS IT MEAN BUT YOU'D ALSO BE SURPRISED 
HOW QUICKLY A MAN'S MIND CAN WORK UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES 
SHE GOES I CAN'T MARRY YOU AND I'M GOING SHE DOESN'T WANT TO MARRY ME 
NOT A LOT OF POINT KEEPING THIS GOING CONTINUING WITH THIS FARCE 
I SUPPOSE I COULD BUY HER OUT OF THE HOUSE OR SELL IT SPLIT THE MONEY 
I COULD MOVE BACK INTO LONDON OR WHEREVER I LIKE 
I COULD MAYBE GO TO L. A. PHONE THAT AGENT 
I'LL DO WHAT I LIKE I'LL DO WHATEVER THE HELL I LIKE 
I'M ONLY JOKING 
LEARN FROM THE MASTER HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN MARRIED 
YEAH EXACT DATES 
EXACT DATES PLEASE 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE POSTER CHILD FOR MARRIAGE HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN MARRIED 
OH 
DECEMBER TWENTY THIRD NINETEEN SIXTY ONE SO WE'LL BE FORTY SEVEN YEARS IN DECEMBER 
THAT DESERVES A ROUND OF APPLAUSE 
IT REALLY DOES 
HE JUST KEEPS TELLING HIMSELF IT'S ONLY A MOVIE 
SHE'S MY TROPHY WIFE AND DO YOU KEEP HER ON THE SHELF 
SHE KEEPS ME HONEST SERIOUSLY SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN MORE MATURE AND BRIGHTER THAN ME 
AND SO I'VE BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO LISTEN TO HER 
HOW DO YOU KEEP THE ROMANCE GOING 
YOU JUST YOU KNOW YOU GET OLDER YOU CHANGE YOUR IDEA OF ROMANCE CHANGES 
SO YOU DON'T BOTHER THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING 
WE BOTHER I'M DELIGHTED TO SAY WE BOTHER BUT THE IDEAL 
THE IDEAL KIND OF WAY TO GO INTO A MARRIAGE IS THAT YOU'LL PROMISE THAT PERSON 
THAT YOU WOULD HELP THEM BECOME THEMSELVES AT ALL COST 
SO YOU WILL TELL THEM THE TRUTH THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH ALL THE TIME 
AND MOST OF THE TIME YOU'LL BE THE ONLY PERSON THAT WILL 
THERE'S ANOTHER LEVEL PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HAPPINESS I'M HAPPY AS LARRY 
HE MAKES ME HAPPY SHE MAKES ME BUT THEY RARELY TALK ABOUT JOY 
AND THAT'S THE THING THAT TRANSCENDS THE WHOLE RELATIONSHIP IS THE ELEMENT OF JOY 
AND REALISING WITH GRATITUDE AND PRAISE THE OTHER PERSON HAS ALLOWED YOU TO EXPERIENCE JOY 
I THINK THAT'S THE MOST PROFOUND THING ANYONE'S EVER SAID ON THIS SHOW 
I HAVE TO ADMIT I'M STILL A BIT STUCK ON THE BE COMPLETELY HONEST AT ALL TIMES THING 
I'M STILL STUCK ON THAT RAPID WHILE YOU'VE SAILED ON DOWN THE RIVER 
I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO WORK 
IT'S THE BEING COMPLETELY HONEST THING THAT'S 
YOU HAVE TO LOVE EACH OTHER ENOUGH TO RISK TELLING THE TRUTH AND RISK THEIR WRATH BY TELLING THEM 
IF YOU ONLY TELL THE TRUTH THE OTHER PERSON NEEDS TO BE MORE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT QUESTIONS THEY ASK 
THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT 
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN WHO ARE YOU TEXTING THEY'RE FAIR ENOUGH TO KEEP US ON OUR TOES 
BUT QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT ARE YOU THINKING 
WOMEN ARE OBSESSED WITH THAT QUESTION WHAT ARE YOU THINKING 
WHY CAN'T YOU SHOW US MEN THE SAME COURTESY AND CONSIDERATION WE SHOW YOU 
AND NOT CARE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE THINKING 
COS AS SOON AS YOU SAY TO YOUR MAN WHAT ARE YOU THINKING DO YOU WANT TO KNOW THE HONEST ANSWER 
HE'S THINKING SHIT BETTER THINK OF SOMETHING TO SAY I'VE BEEN THINKING 
WHATEVER WE HAD BEEN THINKING BEFORE THAT'S GONE NOW 
NO MATTER HOW REASONABLE OR INNOCENT THAT WAS IT'S SCUTTLED OFF 
LITTLE MEN RUNNING ROUND HIS HEAD WHAT ARE WE THINKING WHO'S ASKING 
THINK OF SOMETHING THAT'LL MAKE IT GOOD 
SHE WON'T BELIEVE THAT IN A MILLION YEARS COME ON LADS TRY HARDER 
WE MUST TALK ABOUT THE WEST WING O. K. 
THIS IS TRUE THERE WAS A POLL AND A LARGE SECTION OF AMERICA 
SAID THEY'D LIKE TO HAVE YOU AS PRESIDENT 
YOU HAD A SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT 
DOESN'T THAT GIVE YOU SOME IDEA OF THE TROUBLE WE'RE IN YES 
WHENEVER ANYBODY APPROACHED ME ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING INTO POLITICS 
I WOULD REMIND THEM THAT WE ALREADY TRIED IT WITH AN ANCIENT ACTOR IT DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO WELL 
WE OUGHT TO NOT GO THERE PEOPLE MISTAKE CREDIBILITY WITH CELEBRITY AND THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA 
YOU MUST BE TEMPTED NOT A WHIT NO 
I'M HAPPY AS LARRY PLAYING ALL THE DIFFERENT POLITICIANS 
I'M GUESSING FROM YOUR BUSH COMMENTS YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT I AM 
WHAT'S WEIRD IS THAT'S THE RACE 
THE ELECTION'S GOING TO BE AN ANTICLIMAX AFTER THIS RACE 
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THEY'RE BEATING EACH OTHER UP 
HAVE YOU NAILED YOUR COLOURS TO THE MAST 
I HAVEN'T MAYBE I SHOULD DO IT HERE I'M AN OBAMA SUPPORTER 
BUT YOU MUSTN'T REVEAL IT YET 
BILL CLINTON LOVED THE WEST WING AND HE STILL CALLS ME HIS PRESIDENT 
SO I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER 
I'M AFRAID YOU'VE DONE IT NOW 
BUT I STILL THINK THE DEMOCRATS WILL WIN NO MATTER WHICH ONE OF THEM COMES IN 
THE COUNTRY'S READY FOR A CHANGE WE'VE HAD IT 
IT'S BEEN A DISASTER 
EVEN FROM A DISTANCE WE'VE NOTICED 
DESPITE LOSING PENNSYLVANIA IT IS STILL LOOKING LIKE OBAMA 
BUT HILLARY'S NOT GOING DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT NOT MY WORDS BILL CLINTON'S 
SHE KNOWS WHERE IT'S BEEN 
THIS IS HER OUT ON A CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
I LOVE THIS PICTURE 
LOOK AT THAT WHO IS HOLDING THAT PLACARD 
IS THAT BILL FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO SOME LAUNDRY WOMAN 
AND OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS MERCHANDISING ON THE CAMPAIGN 
THIS IS REAL WE HAVEN'T MADE THIS UP 
YOU CAN BUY THIS 
IT'S A HILLARY CLINTON NUTCRACKER 
YOU LOOK PUZZLED I INSERT THE NUT 
SWEAR TO GOD 
SORRY YOU SURVIVED APOCALYPSE NOW AND HE GOT KILLED BY A NUT IN THE EYE 
ON THE GRAHAM NORTON SHOW 
HE WON'T BE THE FIRST PERSON TO HAVE A NUT IN THE EYE ON THE GRAHAM NORTON SHOW 
DO YOU WANT IT TAKE IT HOME SERIOUSLY 
IT'S ALL RIGHT THANKS SO MUCH ALL THE BEST 
HOW WOULD I WALK INTO THE HOUSE HOW WOULD I GET THROUGH CUSTOMS FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE 
IS THERE ANYTHING IN YOUR BAGGAGE THAT COULD LOOK LIKE A WEAPON 
WELL THERE'S MY HILLARY CLINTON NUTCRACKER 
I'LL LEAVE IT THERE IF AS YOU'RE LEAVING YOU WANT TO TAKE IT 
ALL RIGHT ALL THE BEST THERE YOU HAVE IT 
WE'LL FIND THAT AT THE END OF THE SERIES 
NOW THE WEST WING I MEAN IT WAS A BRILLIANT BRILLIANT SERIES 
YOU WERE IN IT FOR SEVEN YEARS YES 
WHICH IS AN INCREDIBLE SUCCESS FOR ANY TELEVISION PROGRAMME PARTICULARLY A SHOW ABOUT POLITICS 
AND ONE OF THE REALLY FAMOUS THINGS ABOUT IT IS THAT AARON SORKIN WHO WROTE IT 
DID ALL THE INTRICATE OVERLAPPING DIALOGUE 
HE WAS VERY FAMOUS FOR THAT THE FAMOUS WALK AND TALKS 
LOVING THE WALK AND TALKS 
YES THEY'RE GENIUS ARE THEY REALLY HARD TO LEARN 
WELL WE LOVED THEM BECAUSE BY DOING A WALK AND TALK YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANY COVERAGE 
YOU DID A REGULAR SCENE ABOUT SIX OR EIGHT PAGES IT WOULD TAKE HOURS AND HOURS 
OF DOING THE CLOSE UPS AND THE MEDIUM SHOTS AND ALL THAT BUT IF YOU DID A WALK AND TALK 
YOU DID IT IN ONE TAKING MAYBE TWO OR THREE HOURS BUT 
YOU HAD TO REMEMBER YOUR LINES AND HIT YOUR MARK PRECISELY AS THE CAMERA WENT IN FRONT OF YOU 
THEY WERE DIFFICULT TO DO BUT WE WERE HAPPY AS LARRY TO DO THEM RATHER THAN COVERAGE 
HARD TO WATCH SOMETIMES YOU HAD TO REWIND WHAT WAS HE SAYING 
USUALLY THE SHOW I DON'T SHIFT MY ARSE I JUST SIT HERE AND WE TALK WE'RE DONE 
SO BECAUSE OF YOU WE'VE BEEN INSPIRED 
SO WHAT WE THOUGHT WE COULD DO IS A PIECE OF WALKING AND TALKING O. K. 
SO WHAT WE THOUGHT WE'D DO IS WE'VE GOT A STEADICAM THERE 
WAVE YOUR CAMERA A BIT HE CAN'T IT'S STEADY 
ANYWAY IF YOU FOLLOW HIM DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHERE WE'RE GOING HE KNOWS WHERE WE ARE GOING 
O. K. SWELL 
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE GETTING SPONSORED OR ANYTHING 
WE CAN'T CURE A DISEASE IN THE NEXT MINUTE OR SO 
BUT ALL RIGHT SO ARE YOU READY I'M READY 
DON'T YOU START YET SIR 
O. K. HERE WE GO 
THE STEPS AND THINGS O. K. 
WE'RE ALL SET 
READY YES O. K. GO 
WELCOME TO THE SHOW DID YOU WATCH THE BAFTAS

SAINT PATRICK HELLO

I'M IN A BIND THERE YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING 
HELLO MR. PRESIDENT 
ALL THE BEST THANKS SO MUCH 
YOU KNOW OBAMA I'M SORRY BILL 
IN WEST WING I LOVE THE WALK AND TALK 
NOW THAT'S A PRESIDENT 
IF ONLY GORDON BROWN WOULD DO THAT 
NOW LISTEN I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IRELAND O. K. 
BECAUSE LOTS OF PEOPLE CELEBRITIES GET HONORARY DEGREES 
FROM UNIVERSITIES AND I BELIEVE YOU HAD A COUPLE I DID YES 
I WAS IN THE SPRING OF TWO THOUSAND SIX JUST AS THE WEST WING WAS ENDING I GOT AN INVITATION 
FROM THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF IRELAND IN GALWAY TO ACCEPT AN HONORARY DEGREE 
I WAS DELIGHTED BECAUSE I HAD ACCEPTED A FEW IN THE UNITED STATES 
FROM VARIOUS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES BUT THIS PIQUED MY INTEREST 
BECAUSE MY MOTHER WAS FROM IRELAND AND I SPEND A LOT OF TIME THERE 
AND I HAD THIS ROMANTIC FANTASY ABOUT GOING TO COLLEGE COS I NEVER WENT 
AND AT THE TIME I WAS SIXTY FIVE I THOUGHT 
I MIGHT NOT GET A WHOLE LOT MORE OPPORTUNITIES SO I SAID WELL 
I HAVE ENOUGH DEGREES I NEED AN EDUCATION WOULD YOU ALLOW ME TO COME AND STUDY 
I WENT OVER IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND SIX AND I DID ONE SEMESTER FOR FOUR MONTHS 
IT WAS ONE OF THE GREAT TIMES OF MY LIFE OH THERE'S YOU 
AND YOU REALLY DID IT YES YOU WENT TO LECTURES AND STUFF 
I DID THE WHOLE NINE YARDS 
I STUDIED EARTH AND OCEAN SCIENCE ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY AND COMPUTERS 
BECAUSE I'D NEVER OPERATED A COMPUTER 
AND I HAD TO GET MY LESSONS AND PAPERS AND ALL DONE ON THE COMPUTER 
THAT IS MY STUDENT I. D. CARD AT THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY IN GAELIC 
THAT'S MY REAL NAME ON THERE RAMON 
I THOUGHT IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE GAELIC FOR MARTIN SHEEN 
AH SURE IT'S RAMON ESTEVEZ 
THAT'S MY REAL NAME CAN YOU GET A CLOSE UP OF THAT 
THAT'S MY STUDENT I. D. CARD AT N. U. I. 
I'M SO PROUD OF THAT I STILL GET A TEN PER CENT DISCOUNT AT THE BOOK STORE 
IF SOMEBODY SAID TO YOU YOU LOOK LIKE MARTIN SHEEN YOU'D GO I AM NO YOU'RE NOT I AM 
SHOW ME SOME I. D. 
RAMON ESTEVEZ YOU'RE NOT MARTIN SHEEN 
YOU'RE RIGHT 
THIS MIGHT SOUND AN ODD QUESTION 
BUT YOU'RE IN GALWAY WERE YOU THERE FOR NEARLY A YEAR I DID FOUR MONTHS ONE SEMESTER 
FOUR MONTHS WHAT DID YOU EAT 
WE WERE IN AN APARTMENT IN GALWAY AND I RENTED A CAR 
AND THE CAMPUS IS NOT THAT FAR 
AND MY WIFE COOKED OFTEN OR WE WOULD EAT OUT THERE'S SO MANY WONDERFUL PLACES TO EAT IN GALWAY 
OH SO ED AND I ARE LOOKING A BIT BLANK 
WELL I FOUND SOME I'M JUST THINKING IT'S NOT TYPICAL STUDENT LIFESTYLE 
WE ATE IN RESTAURANTS AND DROVE AROUND THE PLACE 
I JUST SAT IN BED EATING POT NOODLE ON TOAST 
THE THING ABOUT BEING A STAND UP COMEDIAN COS YOU WORK IN THE EVENING 
YOU NEVER HAVE TO REALLY SHIFT OUT OF STUDENT LIFESTYLE MODE DO YOU 
NO I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY PRETTY MUCH WHY I GOT INTO STAND UP HAVING 
BEEN A STUDENT IS THAT YOU CAN REMAIN IN BED 
IT JUST PUSHES IT ALL LATER 
I NOW HAVE TO SET AN ALARM TO GET OUT OF BED AT SIX IN THE EVENING 
TO GO TO WORK TO THEN STAY UP ALL NIGHT 
I LOVE BED I THINK BED'S JUST THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD 
I SURE HAVE NO ARGUMENT THERE 
DON'T YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR WHOLE LIFE IS A SERIES OF DISTRACTIONS 
DESIGNED TO GET YOU OUT OF BED 
BED'S WHERE YOU HAVE SEX AND BED'S WHERE YOU SLEEP AND THEY'RE THE TWO BEST THINGS IN THE WORLD 
DOING TWO AT THE SAME TIME I'D BE A HAPPY MAN 
ALWAYS ENVY MY FIANCEE THAT TRICK TSH 
A LONG AND HAPPY MARRIAGE AWAITS 
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE WHOLE IDEA DO YOU KNOW WHAT TRAINSPOTTING IS 
I'VE HEARD OF THE MOVIE I DIDN'T SEE IT BUT 
THERE IS A MOVIE YEAH YES 
IT'S AN ACTUAL ACTIVITY 
IT'S A PASTIME 
WEIRDLY YOU KNOW YOU SAY IT'S A POPULAR PASTIME BUT IT CAN'T BE BUT IT IS 
YOU DO SEE THEM IN STATIONS 
IN FAIRNESS TRAINS AREN'T THAT HARD TO SPOT 
THEY'RE QUITE BIG YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
IT'S NOT EXACTLY LIKE FINDING A HIDDEN STAR IN AN OUTER GALAXY 
AND THEY HAVE TIMETABLES AS WELL 
PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE GO TO A TRAIN STATION WHERE THEY ARE NO CHALLENGE 
THAT'S LIKE GOING TO THE ZOO TO SEE AN ANIMAL 
OF COURSE THEY'RE IN THE TRAIN STATION IT'S WHERE THEY'RE KEPT 
BUT NOW IT'S NOT A VERY GLAMOROUS PASTIME 
AND THERE WAS THIS STORY IN THE NEWS 
GEOFF GREGG KEEN TRAINSPOTTER AND HE LIKES TO STAND IN THE SAME PLACE 
TO SPOT THE TRAINS AS THEY COME PAST 
HERE'S A PICTURE OF HIM WITH HIS DOG 
THAT'S WHERE HE LIKES TO STAND 
NOW ONLY ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS 
THAT PLACE WHERE HE STANDS IT'S ON A BEND RIGHT 
AND THE TRAINS TILT AT THAT POINT 
CAUSING THEM TO EJECT 
OH 
YES THE TRAINS EMPTY THEIR TOILETS ON GEOFF 
AT LEAST HE'S WEARING AN ANORAK 
THIS HASN'T HAPPENED TO HIM ONCE 
YOU'D THINK IT HAPPENED ONCE YOU'D MOVE ON 
YES 
I MUST NEVER STAND HERE AGAIN NO HE'S STANDING HIS GROUND 
THIS IS WHERE HE LIKES TO SPOT TRAINS 
YOU THINK AT LEAST IT'S A NICE DAY OUT HE COMES HOME WITH A NICE TAN 
OH 
WHAT'S THAT FRAGRANCE FOUR FORTY FIVE TO DONCASTER 
POUR HOMME TRAGIQUE 
JEFF COMPLAINED 
UGH 
ADVICE JEFF CLOSE YOUR MOUTH 
I'M AMUSED BY THE PHRASE A FINE SPRAY OF HUMAN WASTE 
I'M SURE THEY MEAN LIKE AS IN A MIST A FINE SPRAY 
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE'S GOING THAT'S A FINE SPRAY OF HUMAN WASTE 
I'VE SEEN SOME SPRAYS OF HUMAN WASTE IN MY TIME 
AND THAT'S A PARTICULARLY FINE ONE THAT IS TOO FINE 
THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY WRONG ABOUT 
IF A BIRD SHITS ON YOU YOU CAN LIVE WITH THAT 
IS THAT ALL THEY DO IS THEY LOOK AT THE TRAIN 
WELL THEY WRITE DOWN THE ENGINE NUMBER AND ALL THAT CARRY ON 
AND WHAT TIME IT CAME THROUGH 
AND IT COMES THROUGH AT THE SAME HOUR EVERY DAY PHRR 
YOU'VE NEVER TRAVELLED BY TRAIN IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE YOU 
THAT'S THE EXCITEMENT OF TRAINSPOTTING 
BUT HE'S STANDING CLOSE TO THE TRACK 
YES COULD HE NOT GO UNDER THAT BAR 
AND GO TO THE OTHER SIDE KNOWING WHAT TIME THE TRAIN'S COMING OR HEARING IT OR SOMETHING 
AND THEN HE'D BE FREE OH MARTIN MART IN 
IT DOESN'T 
YOU'D THINK WOULDN'T YOU 
OH 
WHAT ELSE I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT PROTESTING 
FAMOUSLY YOU LOVE A GOOD PROTEST 
WELL I DON'T LOOK FORWARD TO THEM NO NO 
YOU'VE BEEN ON A HELLUVA LOT OF THEM YEAH 
HOW OFTEN HAVE YOU BEEN ARRESTED I'VE BEEN ARRESTED SIXTY SEVEN TIMES FOR PROTESTING 
WE CALL IT NON VIOLENT CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU SPENT IN PRISON 
NO NOT PRISON THE LONGEST TIME I EVER DID IN ONE STRETCH WAS JUST THREE DAYS 
YOU KNOW IN A JAIL IN WASHINGTON LAWTON IT'S CALLED 
I'VE BEEN ON PROBATION FOR THREE YEARS 
YEAH I DID A PROTEST AT AN AIRFORCE BASE 
AGAINST THE MISSILE SYSTEM 
WHILE I WAS DOING THE WEST WING AND IT GOT KINDA TOUCHY 
BECAUSE MY LAWYER ADVISED ME IF I WENT ON TRIAL I COULD LOSE IN WHICH CASE I'D HAVE TO GO TO JAIL 
AND LEAVE THE WEST WING THAT WOULDN'T LOOK TOO GOOD ON ANY SCALE 
SO WE PLEA BARGAINED FOR THREE YEARS' PROBATION 
COS ED'S BEEN ON AN ANTI NUCLEAR PROTEST AS WELL I HAVE YEARS AGO 
IT WAS WHEN THE FRENCH WERE TESTING NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC 
AND WE WERE ALL OUTSIDE THE FRENCH EMBASSY DOING IT I WAS DOING IT IN LOUISIANA IT WAS QUITE COOL 
I SWEAR THIS IS TRUE I HAD THE CROWD DOING A CHANT WHICH I'D MADE UP WHICH WAS 
WHAT DO WE WANT NO NUKES WHEN DO WE WANT THEM WE DON'T WANT THEM 
ALL THESE PROPER HARDCORE CRUSTY PROTESTERS WERE EVEN DOING THE COMEDY PAUSE AND EVERYTHING 
WE DON'T WANT THEM IT WAS ACTUALLY QUITE SWEET 
THERE WAS A BIT OF PROTESTING NEWS IN THE NEWS YESTERDAY 
I DID LOVE THIS GEORGE GALLOWAY M. M. M. M. P. CAT IMPERSONATOR AND PROFESSIONAL SHIT STIRRER 
HE WAS HIT BY A STRESS BALL THROWN FROM AN OFFICE WINDOW 
WHAT IS A STRESS BALL 
ONE OF THOSE THAT YOU SQUEEZE O. K. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF IT WAS A ROCK 
THEY SAID I COULDN'T THROW AMAZINGLY 
HE WAS HIT ON THE SIDE OF THE HEAD EVEN MORE AMAZINGLY THE BALL MISSED HIS BIG MOUTH 
THOSE STRESS BALLS THEY DO WORK COS THE BLOKE THAT THREW IT HASN'T FELT SO GOOD IN YEARS 
I FEEL GREAT I THINK IT CHEERED US ALL UP REALLY THEY REALLY ARE MARVELLOUS 
THE THING IS DODGING EGGS AND ROTTEN FRUIT AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
IS A HAZARD OF POLITICAL LIFE 
REMEMBER THE GUY WHO THREW THE EGG AT JOHN PRESCOTT 
AND THEN HE PUNCHED HIM 
BUT ACTUALLY IF YOU PLAY THE TAPE BACK FAIRLY SLOWLY 
JUST BEFORE HE PUNCHED HIM HE HAD TIME TO EAT THE EGG AND VOMIT IT UP 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SKY PLUSSED IT BUT SERIOUSLY
