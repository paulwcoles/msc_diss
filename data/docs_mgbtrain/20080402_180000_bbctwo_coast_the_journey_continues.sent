THIS IS JUST INCREDIBLE 
FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW ME ON ONE SIDE IS THE IRISH SEA 
AND ON THE OTHER THE SHIFTING SANDS OF FORMBY POINT NEAR LIVERPOOL 
IT'S THE PERFECT PLACE TO RESUME OUR COASTAL ADVENTURES 
MY TRAVELS AROUND OUR COASTLINE MAKE ME REALISE 
WHAT A TRULY WONDERFUL PLACE IT IS 
I'M GOING TO REVISIT JUST A FEW OF THOSE DEFINING MOMENTS 
FROM THAT EPIC JOURNEY JOINED BY THE USUAL TEAM OF EXPERTS 
ARCHAEOLOGIST MARK HORTON 
ANTHROPOLOGIST ALICE ROBERTS 
WILDLIFE EXPERT MIRANDA KRESTOVNIKOFF 
AND OF COURSE GEOGRAPHER NICK CRANE 
THANKS MICK 
THE FIRST CHALLENGE IS TO LAND ON THE BEACH BECAUSE THIS IS COAST 
ON THIS PROGRAMME OUR JOURNEY STARTS IN NORTH WEST ENGLAND 
BEFORE HEADING UP TO SCOTLAND AND THE OUTER HEBRIDES 
THEN WE LEAP ACROSS TO THE SHETLAND ISLANDS 
BEFORE RETURNING DOWN THE EAST COAST OF SCOTLAND 
AND BACK INTO ENGLAND ENDING IN THE SOUTH EAST AT DOVER 
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY THAT YOU LAND ON A BEACH 
BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT DOES MAKE PERFECT SENSE 
BECAUSE HERE AT SOUTHPORT THE SANDS ARE VERY FLAT AND VERY COMPACT 
BEAUTIFUL 
SO IT'S NOT A HUGE SURPRISE TO DISCOVER I'M NOT THE FIRST PERSON 
TO USE THIS BEACH AS AN AIRSTRIP 
IN NINETEEN TEN JUST SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE WRIGHT BROTHERS' MAIDEN FLIGHT 
CLAUDE GRAHAME WHITE LANDED A FARMAN BIPLANE NEAR THE PIER AT SOUTHPORT 
THE APPEARANCE OF A FLYING MACHINE ON THE SANDS CAUSED A SENSATION 
SOUTHPORT'S BROAD BEACHES QUICKLY BECAME HOME 
TO SOME OF BRITAIN'S PIONEER AVIATORS 
WHOSE ANTICS SOON GAVE WAY TO PLEASURE FLIGHTS 
WHICH PEAKED IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES 
BUT WITH THE COMING OF AFFORDABLE FLIGHTS ABROAD DEMAND DECLINED 
UNTIL SOUTHPORT SANDS FELL SILENT 
SO HAS BEACH AVIATION BEEN GROUNDED FOR EVER 
WELL NO NOT QUITE YET 
BECAUSE ON A STRIP OF VIRGIN PRISTINE SOUTHPORT SAND PLANS ARE AFOOT 
LOCAL ENTHUSIASTS ARE DETERMINED TO BRING AEROPLANES BACK TO SOUTHPORT'S BEACHES 
TODAY SEES THE INAUGURAL FLIGHT 
EVERYTHING IS IN PLACE 
THERE'S A PLANE A PILOT AN AIRSTRIP 
ALL WE NEED IS A PASSENGER GUESS WHO 
THIS D. H. EIGHTY THREE FOX MOTH IS ONE OF THE TWO PLANES THAT ACTUALLY FLEW ON THIS BEACH 
FROM THE MID NINETEEN THIRTIES TO NINETEEN FIFTY 
IN ITS PLEASURE FLYING HEYDAY 
ACEJ OFFERED THE ULTIMATE HOLIDAY EXPERIENCE 
ONE OF THE FINEST WAYS OF SEEING SOUTHPORT IS FROM THE AIR 
NEAR PLEASURELAND A STRETCH OF SAND IS USED AS AN AIRFIELD FOR DELIGHTFUL PLEASURE FLIGHTS 
BUT FIFTY YEARS ON IS IT STILL UP TO THE JOB 
I FEEL IN NEED OF A SAFETY BRIEFING 
THERE ARE TWO OVERWING ENGINES ON THIS PLANE 
THERE'S NO LIFE VEST UNDER YOUR SEAT 
ARE YOU GUYS O. K. VERY WELL THANK YOU 
WHEN IS THE DRINKS TROLLEY COMING ROUND CAN'T HEAR 
THE NEW RUNWAY ON SOUTHPORT SANDS MAY NEVER RECAPTURE THE THRILLS OF THE NINETEEN TWENTIES 
BUT ONCE AIRBORNE YOU CAN SEE HOW HIGH FLYING DREAMS AND THE COASTAL LANDSCAPE CAN BE A PERFECT MATCH 
ACROSS THE RIBBLE ESTUARY IS THIS COAST'S MOST CELEBRATED SEASIDE TOWN 
BLACKPOOL IS A RESORT WITH GLOBAL ASPIRATIONS 
IT'S BIDDING TO JOIN THE PYRAMIDS AND THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA AS A WORLD HERITAGE SITE 
ITS CLAIM THAT IT'S THE WORLD'S FIRST WORKING CLASS SEASIDE RESORT 
QUESTION WHICH LAND MASS LIES RIGHT AT THE HEART OF THE BRITISH ISLES 
BUT IS NOT PART OF THE U. K. 
HAS ITS OWN CELTIC LANGUAGE BUT WAS RULED FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS BY THE VIKINGS 
AND ACCORDING TO LEGEND 
IS PROTECTED BY A CLOAK LIKE MIST SUMMONED BY THE SEA GOD MANANNAN 
WHERE ELSE BUT THE ISLE OF MAN 
THE ISLE OF MAN IS JUST SIXTEEN MILES OFF THE MAINLAND 
BUT IT'S INDEPENDENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE EUROPEAN UNION 
THAT STRETCH OF IRISH SEA REALLY DOES MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE 
THAT STRETCH OF IRISH SEA REALLY DOES MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE 
THE PORT OF DOUGLAS HAS A PERFECT SEA FRONT 
LIKE A CHILD'S PICTURE BOOK 
THE GUIDE BOOKS TELL YOU THAT THE ISLE OF MAN HAS THE OLDEST PARLIAMENT IN THE WORLD 
THE TYNWALD FOUNDED IN NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE 
BUT WHO DOES IT REPRESENT 
WHO ARE THE MANX PEOPLE 
AND WHAT IS THAT WEIRD SYMBOL I'M SEEING EVERYWHERE 
IF ANYONE KNOWS IT'LL BE BUTCH BUTTERY 
FISHERMAN CHEF AND MANXSMAN 
BUTCH WHAT MAKES THIS PLACE TICK 
IT'S THE INDEPENDENCE I THINK 
IT'S THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT ENGLISH WE'RE NOT IRISH WE'RE NOT SCOTTISH 
WE'RE VERY MUCH OUR OWN PEOPLE HERE 
WE'VE NEVER BEEN BIG ON NATURAL RESOURCES JUST FARMING AND FISHING 
AT THE MOMENT THE ECONOMY IS DRIVEN BY THE DIFFERENCE IN TAXATION 
OUR TAXATION IS LOWER THAN THE MAINLAND OUR INCOME TAX IS ONLY TEN PER CENT 
SO WE HAVE A LOT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES HERE INSURANCE SERVICES 
I SUPPOSE HISTORICALLY OUR TAX RATES ON BRANDY AND TOBACCO WERE LOWER THAN THOSE OF THE U. K. 
SO VESSELS WOULD PUT IN HERE AND UNLOAD CARGOES WHICH WOULD THEN BE SMUGGLED BACK TO THE MAINLAND 
WHAT DOES THE THREE LEGGED SYMBOL MEAN TO YOU 
IT'S AN ANCIENT NORSE SYMBOL 
TO MANX PEOPLE IT'S OUR FLAG OUR BADGE A SYMBOL OF OUR NATION 
IT MEANS WHICHEVER WAY YOU THROW ME I WILL STAND 
IT SYMBOLISES THE RESOURCEFULNESS OF THE MANX PEOPLE 
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT GIVING EVERYONE A. 
NOTHING TO DO WITH GIVING EVERYONE A GOOD KICKING NO 
WE'RE HEADING ACROSS THE IRISH SEA 
TO THE NEXT LEG OF OUR JOURNEY 
THE SOUTH WEST COAST OF SCOTLAND 
THE MULL OF GALLOWAY SITS RIGHT BETWEEN IRELAND ENGLAND AND THE ISLE OF MAN 
THERE'S A COLLISION OF BUSY SHIPPING LANES AND TREACHEROUS SEAS 
SO A LIGHTHOUSE COMES AS NO SURPRISE 
BUT THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER ALMOST FORGOTTEN GEM OF COASTAL TECHNOLOGY 
THE MULL OF GALLOWAY IS A GREAT PLACE TO DISCOVER THE LIFE SAVING STORY OF THE LOWLY FOGHORN 
ALONGSIDE SO MANY OF BRITAIN'S LIGHTHOUSES 
SIT THEIR LESS CONSPICUOUS COMPANIONS THE FOGHORNS 
BUT THEIR LOW MOURNFUL SONG HAS ALL BUT DISAPPEARED FROM OUR COASTLINES 
BRITAIN'S FOGHORNS HAVE BEEN SWITCHED OFF 
FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS EVERY TIME FOG ROLLED IN THE FOGHORNS WOULD CALL OUT AROUND THE COAST 
THEIR LOW BOOM SPOKE OF MYSTERY AND HIDDEN DANGERS 
BY THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES ELECTRONIC NAVIGATION WAS MAKING THEM ALL BUT REDUNDANT 
ONE BY ONE THE FOGHORNS FELL SILENT 
BUT THEY'RE NOT ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN 
I WANT TO WORK OUT HOW THE FOGHORNS CAME TO HAVE SUCH A DISTINCTIVE CALL 
THE MAN WHO USUALLY GETS THE CREDIT IS SCOTS BORN INVENTOR ROBERT FOULIS 
ONE FOGGY NIGHT IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THREE IT'S SAID THAT FOULIS HEARD HIS DAUGHTER'S PIANO OUT ACROSS THE BAY 
HE NOTICED THAT THE PIANO'S LOW NOTES SEEMED MUCH MORE DISTINCT THAN THE HIGHER ONES 
FOULIS CONCLUDED THAT LOW NOTES MUST TRAVEL FURTHER 
AND DESIGNED HIS PROTOTYPE FOGHORN TO MATCH 
TO PUT FOULIS'S FOGHORN THEORY TO THE TEST I'LL NEED HELP 
FROM MARK HORTON AND OPEN UNIVERSITY ACOUSTICS EXPERT DAVID SHARP 
ARE YOU GOING OUT IN THE BOAT YES 
FANTASTIC I'LL STAY BEHIND AND PLAY THE PIANO BRILLIANT 
DAVID THERE'S A LIFE JACKET FOR YOU 
IS THAT THE EQUIPMENT LOVELY 
BON VOYAGE 
THE THEORY PREDICTS THAT LOW NOTES SHOULD TRAVEL FURTHER 
BECAUSE THEY LOSE LESS ENERGY OVER DISTANCE THAN HIGH NOTES 
BUT IS THAT TRUE AT SEA 
THE INVENTION OF THE FOGHORN WAS SUPPOSEDLY INSPIRED BY DISTANT PIANO MUSIC ON A FOGGY NIGHT 
SO MARK'S GOING TO PLAY HIGH AND LOW NOTES ON THE PIANO 
WHILE MICROPHONES AND SPEAKERS BOOST THE VOLUME TO FOGHORN PROPORTIONS 
MARK CAN YOU HEAR ME HI ALICE YES LOUD AND CLEAR 
WE'RE READY FOR YOU TO PLAY SOMETHING ON THE PIANO GO AHEAD 
HERE WE GO 
TO MY EARS MARK'S HIGH AND LOW NOTES SEEM EQUALLY LOUD 
DAVID'S RECORDING APPARATUS SEPARATES THE SOUND WAVES OUT 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE THEN 
ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN WE SEE THE LOW FREQUENCY NOTES 
ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE ARE THE HIGH FREQUENCY NOTES 
YOU SEE THE PEAKS COMING UP THERE 
SHALL I STOP HIM I THINK WE SHOULD HAD ENOUGH OF CHOPSTICKS YES 
MARK MARK 
AT THE MOMENT THE LOW NOTES AND THE HIGH NOTES ARE ABOUT THE SAME IN TERMS OF HOW LOUD THEY ARE 
WE'RE GOING TO GO A BIT FURTHER OUT AND TRY THE EXPERIMENT AGAIN 
RIGHT I'LL WAIT HERE 
I'M QUITE HAPPY TO PUT SOME DISTANCE BETWEEN US AND MARK'S PIANO PLAYING 
BUT THERE'S A SERIOUS POINT 
WILL THE LOW NOTES CARRY THEIR ENERGY FURTHER THAN THE HIGH ONES 
MARK CAN YOU HEAR ME 
YES THERE YOU ARE LOUD AND CLEAR YOU'RE ALMOST ON THE HORIZON NOW 
CAN YOU POSSIBLY PLAY ONE LOW NOTE OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
OKEY DOKES 
I CAN HEAR IT 
YOU SEE THE PEAKS STILL THERE AT THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN 
THEY'RE STILL QUITE CLEAR STILL QUITE CLEAR TO THE HUMAN EAR 
MARK WE CAN HEAR THOSE LOW NOTES REALLY WELL OUT HERE 
COULD YOU POSSIBLY PLAY A HIGH NOTE OVER AND OVER AGAIN LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND 
YOU CAN JUST HEAR THAT 
JUST ABOUT COMING THROUGH IT'S NOT SO CLEAR ON THE GRAPH ANY MORE 
IT'S A LOT LOWER THAT'S GREAT 
MARK IT WORKS 
SO THAT MEANS THAT OUR FOGHORN THEORY IS VINDICATED 
AND IT'S GREAT THAT SCIENCE ACTUALLY WORKS 
FOGHORN GENIUS ROBERT FOULIS WAS RIGHT 
LOW SOUNDS DO CARRY THE WARNING CALL FURTHER 
EVERY FOGHORN MADE ITS OWN UNIQUE DISTINCT SOUND 
EACH DIFFERENT BUT NOW ALL SILENT 
SO PLEASE WELCOME FOR ONE FINAL FOGGY CHORUS 
THE RECORDED MASSED FOGHORNS OF THE BRITISH ISLES 
THE MULL OF GALLOWAY MARKS THE END OF OUR MAINLAND JOURNEY FOR NOW 
AS WE EMBARK ON A SCOTTISH ISLAND HOPPING ODYSSEY 
STARTING WITH THE CAPTIVATING 
AND PERFECTLY FORMED ISLAND OF AILSA CRAIG 
THE ISLAND IS NOW A BIRD SANCTUARY 
LONG RENOWNED FOR ITS POPULATION OF SEABIRDS ESPECIALLY GANNETS 
AILSA CRAIG'S UNUSUALLY TOUGH GRANITE IS ALSO PERFECT FOR MAKING OLYMPIC QUALITY CURLING STONES 
THEY ARE EXPORTED ALL OVER THE WORLD 
JUST FURTHER NORTH IS AILSA CRAIG'S BIG BROTHER THE ISLE OF ARRAN 
EVEN AS A NATIVE SCOT I FIND THE ISLAND OF ARRAN UTTERLY BREATHTAKING 
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ALL THIS RUGGED MAGNIFICENCE 
IS JUST A STONE'S THROW FROM THE URBAN SPRAWL OF GLASGOW 
OVER TWO MILLION PEOPLE LIVE ACROSS THE FIRTH OF CLYDE FROM ARRAN 
JUST A FIFTY FIVE MINUTE FERRY RIDE AWAY 
FOR AN ISOLATED ISLAND IT'S VERY WELL CONNECTED 
THAT'S THE SORT OF CONTRAST THAT ARRAN TAKES IN ITS STRIDE WITH ITS DRAMATIC VARIETY OF LANDSCAPES 
JAGGED PEAKS TOWER ABOVE PEACEFUL SHORES 
APPARENTLY ARRAN OWES ITS MOUNTAINOUS LANDSCAPE TO THE TIME WHEN 
SIXTY MILLION YEARS AGO TWO VAST CONTINENTS THAT HAD BEEN STUCK TOGETHER 
STARTED TO DRIFT APART 
AND SCOTLAND WAS RIGHT ON THE FAULT LINE 
THE CONTINENT THAT WOULD BECOME AMERICA AND GREENLAND WENT ONE WAY EUROPE WENT THE OTHER 
IN BETWEEN THE EARTH'S CRUST WAS STRETCHED TO BREAKING POINT 
THAT CREATED VOLCANOES AND ITS MOLTEN ROCK THAT SHAPED ARRAN'S SPECTACULAR MOUNTAINS 
THE UPSHOT OF THIS WILD GEOLOGY IS THAT ARRAN HAS BECOME A VERY POPULAR PLACE TO BE 
AND NOT JUST FOR TOURISTS 
WITH GLASGOW ONLY THIRTY MILES AWAY AS THE CROW FLIES 
IS IT ANY WONDER THAT MANY MAINLAND FOLK WANT TO MAKE IT THEIR OWN BOLTHOLE FROM THE RAT RACE 
FROM THE DRAMATIC MOUNTAINS OF ARRAN WE TAKE A SWIFT LEAP NORTHWARDS 
TO THE REMOTE AND RUGGED COAST OF THE OUTER HEBRIDES 
NOWHERE ELSE IN THE BRITISH ISLES CAN MATCH THIS WONDERLAND OF STACKS 
SECRET INLETS AND WINDSWEPT SHELLSAND BEACHES 
THE VIKINGS CALLED THEM HAVBRODOY ISLANDS ON THE THE EDGE OF THE SEA 
AND THE EDGE IS EXACTLY WHAT IT FEELS LIKE 
OVER TO THE EAST ARE THE ISLANDS OF THE INNER HEBRIDES AND MAINLAND SCOTLAND ITSELF 
OVER THERE TO THE WEST THERE'S NOTHING BUT TWO THOUSAND MILES OF ATLANTIC OCEAN 
I'M HEADING FOR THE SOUTHERN END OF THE HEBRIDES 
AND THE ISLAND OF MINGULAY 
THIS IS THE SORT OF PLACE THAT REALLY PUTS THE ISLES INTO BRITISH ISLES 
FOR SHEER DRAMATIC SCENERY YOU CANNOT BEAT THIS STRETCH OF COASTLINE 
ESPECIALLY DOWN HERE AROUND MINGULAY 
LOOK AT THAT ON A DAY LIKE TODAY AND TELL ME THERE'S A MORE IMPRESSIVE SIGHT ANYWHERE 
THESE ROCKS HAVE STOOD HERE FOR THREE THOUSAND MILLION YEARS 
THE ELEMENTS HAVE ERODED THEM TO FORM MAJESTIC CLIFFS AND ARCHWAYS 
THIS IS LIKE ANOTHER WORLD IT'S LIKE SKULL ISLAND 
IT'S THE SORT OF PLACE YOU EXPECT TO FIND KING KONG LIVING 
THERE ARE OVER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ISLANDS TO EXPLORE ALONG THE OUTER HEBRIDES 
ONLY THIRTEEN OF THESE ARE INHABITED BUT THE OTHERS ARE FAR FROM DESERTED 
THE SHIANTS ARE THREE SMALL VOLCANIC ISLANDS HUDDLED TOGETHER AROUND FOUR MILES OFF THE EAST COAST OF LEWIS 
ALTHOUGH NO ONE LIVES THERE THE PLACE IS BUSTLING WITH WILDLIFE 
OUR RESIDENT ZOOLOGIST MIRANDA KRESTOVNIKOFF IS HEADING OFF 
TO MEET SOME OF THE ISLAND'S MORE COLOURFUL INHABITANTS 
THE SHIANT ISLANDS ARE HOME TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST PUFFIN COLONIES AROUND OUR COAST 
EVERY APRIL THOUSANDS OF THESE LITTLE SQUAT BIRDS APPEAR FROM THE NORTH ATLANTIC OCEAN 
ON AN EPIC JOURNEY BACK TO THESE ISLANDS WHERE THEY WERE BORN 
DUMPY WITH DAY GLO BILLS TANGERINE FEET AND TAILS THAT LOOK AS IF 
THEY'VE HAD AN ENCOUNTER WITH A CARVING KNIFE 
PUFFINS ARE SURPRISINGLY AGILE BIRDS BOTH IN THE AIR AND IN THE SEA 
USEFUL SKILLS WHEN YOU SPEND OVER SEVEN MONTHS OF THE YEAR 
COVERING THOUSANDS OF MILES OF THE VAST ATLANTIC 
THE SHIANT ISLANDS ARE A FAR CRY FROM THE PUFFIN'S SOLITARY OCEAN LIFE 
HERE THEY'VE GOT TO GET ALONG WITH THE NEIGHBOURS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OF THEM 
LIVING SO TIGHTLY PACKED TOGETHER ON THE ISLAND 
PUFFINS HAVE DEVELOPED ADVANCED WAYS OF COMMUNICATING 
BY CALLING TO EACH OTHER USING THEIR BILLS AND DIFFERENT BODY POSTURES 
JUST BEEN LOOKING AT A GROUP DOWN THERE 
THERE'S ONE STANDING UP VERY STRAIGHT VERY UPRIGHT 
BASICALLY THAT'S SAYING THIS IS MY TERRITORY AND I OWN THIS BURROW 
BUT THEIR POSTURING IS NOT ALL ABOUT PROPERTY 
PUFFINS MATE FOR LIFE AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SPECIAL WAY OF SHOWING AFFECTION 
HOME LIFE ON THE SHIANT ISLANDS IS MADE EVEN MORE AGREEABLE 
BY THE RICH PICKINGS IN THE SEA 
THE PLANKTON RICH WATER IS IDEAL IF YOU ARE A GREAT SWIMMER AND LOVE TO EAT SMALL FISH 
THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE TO GET UP CLOSE TO THESE VERSATILE BIRDS 
AND OBSERVE HOW WELL THEY PERFORM UNDER WATER 
WATCHING THEM CHASE FISH 
THEIR QUIRKY BODY SHAPES SUDDENLY MAKE SENSE 
THEIR WINGS ACT AS FINS AND THEIR WEBBED FEET BECOME A RUDDER 
MAKING THEM FLY THROUGH THE WATER WITH INCREDIBLE GRACE 
SEEING THESE BIRDS UNDER WATER IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THEY'RE ALSO CREATURES OF THE SKY 
AS SLICK AS SEALS BUT AS FLIGHT LOVING AS SEAGULLS 
THE PUFFINS ARE TOTALLY AT HOME HERE BOTH ABOVE AND BELOW THE WATERLINE 
FORTY MILES OUT INTO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN LIES A GROUP OF ISLANDS THAT HAS AN ALMOST MYTHICAL STATUS 
SAINT KILDA 
IT'S A PLACE OF SUPERLATIVES 
THE BIGGEST SEA CLIFFS IN BRITAIN 
THE LARGEST SEABIRD COLONIES 
AND THE REMOTEST VILLAGE STREET 
REGULAR LINES OF STONE WALLS AND HOUSES ARE STILL STANDING 
BUT THE LAST NATIVE SAINT KILDANS LEFT IN NINETEEN THIRTY 
THE HEBRIDES ALMOST SEEM LIKE FANTASY LANDS OUT OF A FAIRY TALE 
IT'S SOMETIMES EASY TO FORGET THAT THEY'RE PART OF THE BRITISH COASTLINE 
ALTHOUGH THESE MAJESTIC ISLES ARE REMOTE 
WE ARE NOW HEADING FOR A SET OF ISLANDS EVEN MORE FAR FLUNG OFF THE MAINLAND 
SHETLAND 
YOU COULD BE FORGIVEN FOR THINKING SHETLAND AND ORKNEY 
ARE LOCATED IN BOXES OFF SCOTLAND 
IT'S USUALLY HOW THEY APPEAR ON MAPS 
IN FACT WE'RE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILES NORTH OF ABERDEEN 
AT THE VERY TOP OF BRITAIN 
MUCKLE FLUGGA 
OVER ONE HUNDRED ISLANDS MAKE UP SHETLAND CREATING A COASTLINE THAT'S A STAGGERING NINE HUNDRED MILES LONG 
ON MAINLAND BRITAIN YOU'RE NEVER MORE THAN SEVENTY TWO MILES FROM THE SEA 
HERE IN SHETLAND THAT MAXIMUM DISTANCE IS THREE MILES 
LIFE HERE IS ABOUT AS COASTAL AS IT GETS 
LIVING SO CLOSE TO THE SEA CERTAINLY ISN'T STRESS FREE 
THESE ISLANDS ARE IN THE FIRING LINE FOR SOME OTHER MOST SEVERE STORMS IN THE U. K. 
FORCE TEN GALES AND THIRTY F. T. WAVES ARE COMMON 
THE NORTH WEST COAST IS THE WORST HIT 
IT BEARS THE BRUNT OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC STORM TRACK 
NICK CRANE WENT TO ESHA NESS TO LOOK FOR EVIDENCE 
OF ONE PARTICULAR CATASTROPHIC EVENT THAT DEVASTATED THIS COASTLINE 
THIS COAST IS STREWN WITH CLUES 
CLUES WHICH REVEAL THE TERRIFYING POWER OF THE SEA 
YOU JUST HAVE TO KNOW WHERE TO LOOK 
ACROSS THE LOCH FROM ONE OF THE U. K.'S BIGGEST OIL TERMINALS 
I'M ON THE HUNT FOR SIGNS OF A CATACLYSMIC EVENT WHICH HIT THESE ISLANDS THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO 
THANKS MICK 
APPARENTLY THE EVIDENCE IS HIDDEN IN THE PEAT BANKS OF SULLOM VOE 
LOVELY BEACH YOU'VE BROUGHT ME TO ADRIAN YES 
GEOMORPHOLOGIST ADRIAN HALL IS GOING TO SHOW ME WHAT TO LOOK FOR 
THIS IS PEAT WELL I KNOW THAT 
YES IT'S GOT A WONDERFUL ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY LOCKED IN HERE 
WE'VE GOT TURF UP HERE MODERN VEGETATION WHERE WE ARE TODAY 
THEN HERE WE'VE GOT DRIED OUT PEAT AND THEN WE'VE GOT SOME VERY CLEAR LAYERS IN THE PEAT 
THEN WHEN WE GET DOWN TO ABOUT HERE WE'VE GOT A VERY VERY CLEAR CHANGE 
IT'S MAINLY SAND BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE LUMPS OF GRAVEL 
YEAH SUDDEN CHANGE OF COLOUR ISN'T THERE AND TEXTURE 
BUT EVEN MORE STRIKING ARE THESE LUMPS OF PEAT 
WHICH CLEARLY HAVE BEEN TORN UP FROM SOME PRE EXISTING PEAT BANK 
OH YEAH LET'S JUST HAVE A LOOK AT THAT 
SEE THE SAND LAYER IS REALLY QUITE THICK 
YEAH IT'S GOT TINY MARINE ORGANISMS IN IT 
SO WE NEED A PROCESS THAT BRINGS THIS MATERIAL FROM THE SEABED UP ONTO THE LAND SO WHAT IS IT 
WELL THERE'S ONLY ONE THING THAT CAN PRODUCE DEPOSITS 
OF SAND TWENTY METRES ABOVE SEA LEVEL AND THAT'S A TSUNAMI 
A TIDAL WAVE A TIDAL WAVE 
THE SAND LAYER BURIED IN THIS PEAT 
IS EVIDENCE OF A TSUNAMI THAT HIT THIS COASTLINE SEVEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
IT WAS CAUSED BY A GIGANTIC UNDERWATER AVALANCHE 
ON THE CONTINENTAL SLOPE OFF NORWAY 
WHEN A MASS OF SEDIMENT COLLAPSED ONTO THE SEABED 
IT GENERATED KILLER WAVES DESTINED FOR SHETLAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILES AWAY 
WELL THE FIRST HUNTER GATHERERS WERE ALREADY ON SHETLAND SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
WE'VE GOT TO IMAGINE THIS AS A BROAD OPEN VALLEY THE SEA FAR OUT THERE 
AND THEN SUDDENLY ON THE HORIZON THERE WOULD BE A WALL OF WATER MOVING VERY RAPIDLY 
SO IT FUNNELLED DOWN SULLOM VOE 
IT GOT CONSTRAINED BETWEEN THE TWO SHORES 
IT WOULD BUILD AND GROW UNTIL EVENTUALLY YOU ARE LOOKING AT A WALL OF WATER TWENTY METRES HIGH 
AND THEN IT WOULD BREAK AND SURGE FORWARD INTO THIS AREA 
CARRYING THE DEBRIS AND HURLING IT UP AGAINST THE LAND 
THE LOW LYING PARTS OF SHETLAND WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED 
THIS ANCIENT TSUNAMI REACHED AS FAR SOUTH AS THE ENGLISH BORDER 
THE TSUNAMI WHICH STRUCK THESE ISLANDS WAS A FREAK EVENT 
BUT THE WAVES GENERATED BY NORTH ATLANTIC WEATHER PATTERNS ARE NOT 
AND THEY CAN BE JUST AS FEROCIOUS 
BIG WAVES ARE GOING TO REACH FURTHER INLAND 
LIFE ON THE EDGE COULD GET A LOT MORE PRECARIOUS 
OVER SIXTY SEVEN DIFFERENT ISLANDS MAKE UP ORKNEY 
OR AS THEY WERE KNOWN TO THEIR VIKING RULERS ORKNEYJAR 
SEAL ISLANDS 
NOWADAYS THE ISLAND HOPPING LIFESTYLE OF THE LOCALS 
HAS LED TO A UNIQUE CLAIM TO FAME 
PEOPLE COME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO FLY LESS THAN TWO MILES BETWEEN PAPA WESTRAY AND WESTRAY 
HERE WE ARE THEN WHEELS UP ON THE WORLD'S SHORTEST SCHEDULED FLIGHT 
I HAVE TO SAY IT'S ALL GOING VERY WELL SO FAR 
THIS JOURNEY USUALLY TAKES A COUPLE OF MINUTES 
BUT IT'S BEEN DONE IN JUST SIXTY NINE SECONDS WHEN IT MADE THE GUINNESS BOOK OF RECORDS 
SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME THAT THE MOST DANGEROUS PART OF FLYING IS TAKING OFF AND LANDING 
BUT THAT'S ALL THIS FLIGHT IS A TAKE OFF AND A LANDING 
THIS FLIGHT MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE EXTRAVAGANT 
BUT THE FOURTEEN FARE IS SUBSIDISED BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPORTANT LINK FOR THESE REMOTE COMMUNITIES 
AND WE'RE DOWN 
OUR NEXT HOP TAKES US OVER THE WATER AGAIN TO HOY 
HOY MEANS HIGH ISLAND 
AND HOY IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS 
THESE SEA CLIFFS ARE SOME OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE IN BRITAIN 
EARLIER TODAY TWO CLIMBERS SET OUT TO TACKLE ORKNEY'S MOST FAMOUS LANDMARK 
THE OLD MAN OF HOY STANDS FOUR FIFTY F. T. TALL ON THE SHORES OF THE PENTLAND FIRTH 
THIS MAGNIFICENT SEA STACK USED TO BE ATTACHED TO THE HEADLAND 
BUT THE ELEMENTS HAVE SLOWLY ERODED THE SOFT RED SANDSTONE TO CREATE THIS SOLITARY PINNACLE 
THIS MORNING CLIMBERS ANDY CAVE AND SIMON NADIN 
SET OUT TO TACKLE ORKNEY'S MOST FAMOUS LANDMARK 
I'M OFF TO CATCH UP WITH THE GUYS 
TO FIND OUT WHAT MAKES THIS STACK THE ONE EVERY CLIMBER WANTS TO BAG 
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT THERE 
YEAH HOW WAS THAT VERGE 
A BIT OF A BAD ONE YOU'VE GOT A LATHER ON THERE KID 
I RECKON I'M GONNA HAVE MIDGES ALL THE WAY UP 
I CAN'T HANDLE THE MIDGES BUT WE'RE COPING WITH THE SEA STACK 
HELLO ANDY IT'S NEIL CAN YOU HEAR ME 
ALL RIGHT NEIL HOW'S IT GOING MATE 
I'M FINE BUT I'M ON THE MAINLAND HOW'S IT BEEN GOING SO FAR 
I MUST ADMIT WE WERE A BIT WORRIED BECAUSE IT'S BEEN RAINING AND IN THE MIST IT'S VERY EASY TO SLIP OFF 
OUR HANDS WERE COVERED IN GREEN SLIME AND OUR FEET IN BIRD POO SO IT'S HORRIBLE VERY INSECURE 
BUT I THINK NOW WE ARE LESS WORRIED AND CONCENTRATING ON THE JOB REALLY 
RIGHT I'LL LET YOU CRACK ON 
THE OLD MAN WASN'T CONQUERED FOR THE FIRST TIME UNTIL NINETEEN SIXTY SIX 
IT WAS A THREE MAN TEAM CHRIS BONINGTON TOM PATEY AND RUSTY BAILLIE 
EVEN EVEREST HAD BEEN CLIMBED MANY YEARS BEFORE ANYONE KNOCKED OFF THIS MONSTER 
NICE NICE FINISH YEAH 
IT TOOK THE ORIGINAL TEAM TWO DAYS TO FIND A ROUTE TO THE SUMMIT 
CLIMBING IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS IT'S TAKEN OUR GUYS AROUND FIVE HOURS 
NICE ONE 
EXCELLENT 
I'M ABSOLUTELY STUNNED I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID IT 
GIVEN HOW MISERABLE IT WAS WHEN YOU STARTED OUT THIS MORNING 
YEAH I KNOW WE'RE PRETTY SURPRISED TOO BUT IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO BE UP HERE IT REALLY IS 
WE HAVE TO SHOW RESPECT FOR CHRIS BONINGTON AND CO 
WHO MADE THE FIRST ASCENT WHICH HAS ENABLED US TO REACH THIS POINT 
WE'VE CLIMBED ALL OVER THE WORLD BUT THERE'S NOT MANY PLACES AS COOL AS THIS THAT'S FOR SURE 
WE TRAVEL SOUTH NOW BACK TOWARDS THE MAINLAND OF SCOTLAND 
AND THE COAST OF ABERDEENSHIRE 
LIKE SHETLAND AND ORKNEY THIS COASTLINE IS EXPOSED TO 
THE SWEEPING LASH OF THE NORTH SEA 
BREEDING GENERATIONS OF BRAVE AND INGENIOUS SEAFARERS 
FOR CENTURIES THE ONLY WAY OF POWERING A SHIP WAS BY SAIL 
BY THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THOUGH 
STEAM POWER HAD TAKEN OVER 
AND DOMINATED THE GREAT OCEAN TRADING ROUTES 
BUT AS MARK HORTON FOUND OUT SAIL WAS ABOUT TO FIGHT BACK 
THIS IS THE TYPE OF BOAT THAT SAILORS CAME UP WITH TO BEAT STEAM 
NOT A GLAMOROUS TEA CLIPPER BUT A FISHING BOAT 
THIS WAS A NEW GENERATION OF SAIL POWER 
I'M ON THE REAPER A GORGEOUS HERRING FISHING BOAT BUILT IN NINETEEN OH ONE 
ON THE NORTH EAST COAST OF SCOTLAND 
HUGE SAILS MADE BOATS LIKE THIS ONE FAST 
AND TO HANDLE THOSE HUGE SAILS 
NEW TECHNOLOGIES LIKE STEAM POWERED CAPSTANS 
WERE COMBINED WITH TRADITIONAL SAILING KNOW HOW 
IT'S THAT MARRIAGE OF OLD AND NEW THAT WAS THE KEY 
TO THE SURVIVAL OF SAIL POWER IN THE HERRING FLEET 
IN A FAVOURABLE WIND THESE BOATS COULD EASILY OUTRUN PLODDING STEAM TRAWLERS 
LIVELIHOODS DEPENDED ON THE SPEED OF THESE WORKING BOATS 
TOM GARDNER'S FAMILY HANDLED HERRING BOATS FOR GENERATIONS 
HI TOM 
HI MARK CAN I HAVE A GO YES CERTAINLY WHAT'S OUR COURSE 
STEER ON NORTH RIGHT 
ONE THING THAT IMMEDIATELY STRUCK ME IS THERE'S NO RAILS DOWN THE SIDE 
THAT'S THE REASON THIS RIG WAS SO POPULAR 
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO STAYS IN THE WAY OF WHERE YOU WORKED YOUR NETS RIGHT 
WERE MANY PEOPLE LOST OVERBOARD 
THERE WAS QUITE A FEW 
I'VE BEEN OVER THE SIDE MYSELF 
IT'S NOT A GREAT FEELING 
WE HAVE THIS ROMANTIC VIEW OF LIFE AT SEA BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN REALLY HORRIBLE 
YES AN AWFUL LOT OF HARD WORK AND HARDSHIP 
YOU EITHER GOT THE HERRING SOLD OR YOU HAD TO DUMP THEM AT SEA 
AND THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN THE HEARTBREAK OF CATCHING HERRING 
NOT BEING ABLE TO SELL THEM AND DUMPING THEM IF YOU DIDN'T SELL YOUR FISH YOU DIDN'T EARN ANY MONEY 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A REALLY HARD LIFE ON THESE BOATS 
IT'S A HARDER LIFE WHEN YOU KEEP GOING OFF COURSE 
IF WE GO OFF COURSE WE'LL THROW YOU OVER THE SIDE 
BOATS LIKE THE REAPER ONLY RAN WITH THE WIND FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS 
SAIL WAS BLOWN AWAY BY NEW DIESEL DRIVEN TECHNOLOGY 
THE FREE POWER OF THE WIND WAS FINALLY REDUNDANT 
WE CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY SOUTH TO SCOTLAND'S CAPITAL CITY 
EDINBURGH CASTLE STANDS PROUD OF CANYON LIKE GREY STREETS 
AND TOWERING ABOVE IT ALL A VOLCANIC PLUG OF ROCK ARTHUR'S SEAT 
IT'S UP HERE THAT YOU SEE EDINBURGH FOR WHAT IT REALLY IS 
A COASTAL CITY THAT REACHES OVER THE FIRTH OF FORTH WITH TWO GREAT BRIDGES 
WHILST THE FAMOUSLY ROBUST VICTORIAN RAIL BRIDGE IS THE MORE PHOTOGRAPHED 
THE SLENDER SWEEP OF THE NINETEEN SIXTIES ROAD BRIDGE BEHIND IT 
CARRIES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MORE PEOPLE ACROSS THE WATER 
BUT THERE COULD BE A TICKING TIME BOMB IN THE DESIGN OF THE SUSPENSION BRIDGE 
AND OTHERS LIKE IT AROUND OUR COAST 
ALICE ROBERTS WENT TO DISCOVER THE FORTH ROAD BRIDGE'S HIDDEN WEAKNESS 
THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF ANY SUSPENSION BRIDGE ARE THE CABLES THAT SUSPEND IT 
AND HERE THEY ARE THESE ARE SIXTY ONE CENTIMETRES IN DIAMETER 
AND STRETCH ALL THE WAY FROM ONE END OF THE BRIDGE TO THE OTHER 
AND THE ROADWAY DOWN THERE IS LITERALLY SUSPENDED FROM THEM 
IT'S A BRILLIANTLY SIMPLE IDEA BUT IT MAY HAVE A FATAL FLAW 
AND THESE CABLES ARE CAUSING SERIOUS CONCERN 
THE CABLES THAT HOLD UP THE ROADWAY ARE GRADUALLY CORRODING 
TWENTY FOUR MILLION VEHICLES A YEAR USE THIS BRIDGE 
THE NEAREST ALTERNATIVE CROSSING MEANS A FORTY MILE DIVERSION 
IF YOU TOOK AWAY THIS BRIDGE TOMORROW IT WOULD BE AN ECONOMIC DISASTER FOR THE ENTIRE REGION 
TO SEE WHY THE CABLES ARE SO VULNERABLE 
I'M GOING INTO THE VERY INNARDS OF THE BRIDGE WITH KEITH PERRYMAN AN INSPECTOR HERE FOR NINE YEARS 
THIS IS WHERE WE SEE THE CABLES FOR WHAT THEY REALLY ARE AND THAT IS LOADS AND LOADS OF WIRES 
THERE MUST BE THOUSANDS THERE'S IN EXCESS OF ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WIRES WOW 
EACH OF THESE WIRES IS ACTUALLY QUITE SLENDER ABOUT FIVE M. M. IN DIAMETER 
JUST UNDER FIVE M. M. IN DIAMETER 
THIS IS WHAT'S HOLDING THE BRIDGE UP 
YES WITHOUT THE WIRES NO CABLE WITHOUT THE CABLE NO BRIDGE THIS IS IT 
A CORRODED OR RUSTY WIRE IS WEAK 
ANY ONE OF THE ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WIRES IN EACH CABLE IS LIABLE TO SNAP AT ANY TIME 
ANYWHERE ALONG THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE BRIDGE 
THE CORROSION OF THE WIRES IS A SLOW DEATH SENTENCE 
SO IS THERE A SOLUTION TO THE CORRODING CABLES 
HOLDING ALL OF THIS UP 
WITHOUT KNOWING HOW FAST IT'S WEAKENING 
THE BRIDGE TEAM IS WORKING BLIND 
SOMEHOW BRIDGE MASTER ALASTAIR ANDREW NEEDS TO GET TO THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM 
ALASTAIR HOW CAN YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE THOSE CABLES 
BECAUSE PRESUMABLY YOU CAN'T OPEN THEM UP NO 
WE CAN'T OPEN UP THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE CABLE 
THE ONLY WAY TO DO THIS IS TO ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THE CABLE 
WHAT WE HAVE HERE ARE MICROPHONES ATTACHED TO THE CABLE THERE 
THAT'S THE MICROPHONES THERE 
THEY'RE LISTENING FOR ANY WIRE BREAKS THAT OCCUR INSIDE THE CABLE 
SO IT'S LIKE A STETHOSCOPE LISTENING TO THE HEALTH OF THE CABLES 
EXACTLY THE DIFFERENCE BEING THAT WE HAVE FIFTEEN MICROPHONES 
PLACED OVER THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF EACH CABLE AND WE'RE LISTENING ALL THE TIME 
CONTINUOUSLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS ABSOLUTELY 
THE MICROPHONES BEGAN THEIR ROUND THE CLOCK VIGIL IN AUGUST TWO THOUSAND SIX 
AND STRAIGHTAWAY THE COMPUTERS BEGAN TO PICK UP STRANGE SOUNDS 
HIDDEN IN THE BACKGROUND NOISE FROM THE TRAFFIC 
THWACK 
THWACK 
THESE INNOCUOUS SOUNDING CLICKS ARE ACTUAL WIRES SNAPPING 
SO FAR THE BRIDGE HAS LOST AROUND TEN PER CENT OF ITS STRENGTH 
AND PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD FACE THE SAME PROSPECT 
CABLE CORROSION IS AFFECTING BRIDGES IN THE U. S. AND EUROPE 
BUT CLOSER TO HOME IT'S EVEN MORE SEVERE 
THE OLD SEVERN BRIDGE IS URGENTLY HAVING TO TACKLE THE SAME PROBLEM 
AND OTHERS MAY FOLLOW 
WE MAY SOON HAVE TO REBUILD BRIDGES 
ACROSS THE GREAT COASTAL BARRIERS WE THOUGHT WE'D CONQUERED 
AT THE MOUTH OF THE FIRTH OF FORTH 
THIS MARITIME GATEWAY HAS A FORMIDABLE GATEKEEPER THE BASS ROCK 
ONCE UPON A TIME THE SITE OF ONE OF SCOTLAND'S MOST NOTORIOUS PRISONS 
AS WE CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY SOUTH WE CROSS THE BORDER BACK INTO ENGLAND 
AND THE PRETTY MARKET TOWN OF BERWICK UPON TWEED 
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS BERWICK WAS THE SCENE OF MANY A BLOODY BATTLE BETWEEN THE SCOTS AND THE ENGLISH 
IT WAS FINALLY BAGGED BY ENGLAND IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO 
THE NORTH EAST COAST OF ENGLAND HAS ALWAYS HAD A STRONG RELIGIOUS TRADITION 
ONE THAT LED TO THE CREATION OF THE TOWN OF SALTBURN 
VICTORIAN INDUSTRIALIST HENRY PEASE BUILT THIS COASTAL TOWN FROM SCRATCH 
AFTER SEEING AN APPARITION OF A HEAVENLY CITY ABOVE THE CLIFFS 
AS PEASE WAS TEETOTAL THEY HAD NO PUBLIC HOUSES 
AND TO REFLECT THE PURITY OF HIS VISION PEASE HAD THE TOWN CLAD IN A DISTINCTIVE WHITE BRICK 
THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN OF HIS HEAVENLY TOWN WAS THIS MAGNIFICENT HOTEL 
BUT THE GRAND GUESTS HAVE LONG SINCE MOVED ON 
THE HOTEL HAS BEEN SOLD OFF FOR FLATS 
SHEILA DAVIES IS ONE OF THE FORTUNATE FEW 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU LIVED HERE SHEILA THREE YEARS 
AND WHAT ATTRACTED YOU HOLD ON 
I THINK I CAN SEE WHAT ATTRACTED YOU 
I CAME ON A WHIM 
AND I LOOKED 
AND I COULDN'T AFFORD IT AND I THOUGHT 
I'M GOING TO LIVE HERE 
IT'S A WEE BIT SPECIAL 
IT IS 
I FELL IN LOVE INSTANTLY 
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE SLICE OF HEAVEN UP HERE IT'S SHEILA'S SHANGRI LOUISIANA 
WHAT'S UP ABOVE THERE'S A LOVELY VIEW UP THERE FOR YOU THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES 
CAN I YOU CERTAINLY CAN 
FANTASTIC 
I WASN'T EXPECTING THIS IT'S LIKE GETTING UP INTO THE CROW'S NEST 
WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT A VIEW LIKE THAT 
YOU COULD TALK ABOUT THE COAST UNTIL YOU WERE BLUE IN THE FACE BUT THIS IS ALL YOU NEED TO SEE 
THAT'S WHY THE BRITISH COASTLINE IS SPECIAL 
JUST EIGHT MILES SOUTH OF SALTBURN LIES THE TINY FISHING PORT OF STAITHES 
AND THE BEAUTY OF THIS TOWN OWES NOTHING TO MAN AND EVERYTHING TO NATURE 
IT WAS ALSO THE BOYHOOD HOME OF THE GREAT NAVIGATOR CAPTAIN COOK 
JUTTING OUT INTO THE NORTH SEA FLAMBOROUGH HEAD 
HAS WITNESSED COUNTLESS SHIPWRECKS ON ITS PERILOUS ROCKS 
BUT THERE'S REASSURANCE TO BE FOUND DOWN THE COAST IN BRIDLINGTON 
THE HARBOUR HERE IS TIGHTLY PACKED WITH FISHING BOATS AND PLEASURE CRAFT OF ALL KINDS 
THAT MEANS ONE VERY SPECIAL BOAT WILL ALWAYS BE ON HAND 
THE BLUE AND ORANGE COLOURS OF THE RNLI ARE AS FAMILIAR AS BUCKETS AND SPADES 
BUT RUNNING A HIGH TECH RESCUE SERVICE DOESN'T COME CHEAP 
AS A NATION OF ISLAND DWELLERS WE HAPPILY CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR 
BUT THE CREWS PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR NEXT TO NOTHING 
THE SAFETY OF SEAFARERS ON THIS COAST HAS BEEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF VOLUNTEER CREWS FOR OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS 
OVER THEIR LONG HISTORY LIFEBOATS HAVE ACQUIRED NOT JUST 
THEIR DISTINCTIVE COLOURS BUT A DISTINCTIVE SHAPE 
BRIDLINGTON CREWS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE DESIGN OF THEIR BOATS RIGHT FROM THE START 
THIS WAS ONE OF BRIDLINGTON'S FIRST LIFEBOATS THE SEAGULL 
PAID FOR BY A LOCAL CLERGYMAN IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE 
THE DESIGN WAS BASED ON THE HEAVY WOODEN FISHING BOATS SO FAMILIAR TO ITS VOLUNTEER CREW 
IN STORMY SEAS THE CONSTANT FEAR WAS OF CAPSIZING 
ONCE TURNED OVER THESE UNWIELDY BOATS WERE VERY DIFFICULT TO RIGHT 
TO FIND OUT WHY I'M MEETING ANDREW ASHTON AN EXPERT IN LIFEBOAT DESIGN 
IF YOU HAD AN ORDINARY BOAT 
IF WATER WERE ALLOWED TO GET INTO THE HULL 
THE INTEGRITY OF THE HULL WAS BROKEN AND IT LOST BUOYANCY 
I'LL BE WEATHER I'LL BE EXTREMELY BAD A PERFECT STORM 
AS WE CAN SEE THE BOAT WILL SINK 
VERY RAPIDLY HERE WE HAVE A STATE OF THE ART LIFEBOAT 
AND ALL OF IT DONE WITH MASKING TAPE AND BUBBLE WRAP 
IN THE SAME CONDITIONS 
BECAUSE WE CAN MAINTAIN BUOYANCY THE BOAT WILL FLOAT 
FAIR ENOUGH THAT BUBBLE WRAP GIVES ANDREW'S SELF RIGHTING BOAT 
AN AIRTIGHT COMPARTMENT AT EACH END 
EVEN SWAMPED WITH WATER IT STILL FLOATS 
IF THIS WERE TO BE EVEN INVERTED BY A WAVE CAPSIZED BY A HUGE WAVE 
SHE WILL COME UP AGAIN 
SO THAT'S HOW THE TRADITIONAL SELF RIGHTING LIFEBOAT GOT ITS CLASSIC SHAPE 
WITH THE DISTINCTIVE SEALED POD AT EITHER END FOR BUOYANCY 
IN RECENT YEARS THE PRINCIPLE HAS DEVELOPED EVEN FURTHER 
SO THAT THE ENTIRE VESSEL IS NOW TIGHTLY SEALED 
BUT THERE'S ONE THING LIFEBOAT DESIGNERS CAN'T BUILD INTO ANY NEW VESSEL 
THE EMOTIONAL BOND BETWEEN THE MEN AND THEIR BOAT 
IT'S STRONGER WITH EVERY RESCUE 
WE CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY SOUTH TO THE DRAMATIC SANDY BEACHES 
MUDFLATS AND SALT MARSHES OF EAST ANGLIA 
THE MOST EASTERLY EDGE OF THE COUNTRY 
ALONG MOST OF THE COASTLINE OF BRITAIN 
THE BREAK BETWEEN THE LAND AND THE SEA IS VERY STARK STEEP CLIFFS CRASHING WAVES THAT KIND OF THING 
BUT HERE IN NORFOLK IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
THE LINE BETWEEN THE LAND AND SEA IS CHANGING ALL THE TIME 
EVERY TIME YOU TURN AROUND HERE IT'S MOVED AND CREPT UP BEHIND YOU 
AND SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO SAY WHERE ONE ENDS AND THE OTHER BEGINS 
THE VILLAGES LIKE HERE AT WELLS NEXT THE SEA 
ARE OFTEN SET A LONG WAY BACK 
WITH INLET HARBOURS THEIR ONLY LINK TO THE COAST 
BECAUSE OF THE FAST MOVING TIDE 
MUCH OF THIS STRETCH IS DANGEROUS TO INVESTIGATE ON FOOT 
BUT FROM THE NEXT HARBOUR ALONG COUNTLESS BOAT TRIPS TAKE VISITORS 
OUT TO EXPLORE THE LANDSCAPE AND WILDLIFE AROUND HERE 
IT'S THE PROMISE OF SEEING SEALS THAT DRAWS SO MANY VISITORS HERE 
WOW THERE'S HUNDREDS OF THEM 
I THOUGHT THEY'D ALL GO IN THE WATER AS SOON AS WE TURNED UP BUT THEY'RE NOT BOTHERED 
NOT BOTHERED IN THE SLIGHTEST 
THE COLONY THAT LIVES HERE MAKES UP AROUND FIVE HUNDRED 
UNUSUALLY IT'S MADE UP OF BOTH COMMON AND GREY SEALS 
IT'S RARE TO SEE THEM IN THE SAME PLACE SO SEEING THEM TOGETHER IS A TREAT 
THIS STRETCH OF COAST HAS SEEN REPEATED WAVES OF TRIBAL SETTLERS 
THAT HAVE HELPED FORGE OUR NATIONAL IDENTITY 
BUT OUR ANCESTORS NEVER GOT ROUND TO COLONISING THIS HEADLAND 
UNTIL RECENTLY IT WAS MOSTLY A MARSH BUT NOW IT'S FELIXSTOWE 
THE U. K.'S LARGEST CONTAINER PORT 
NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF THE GOODS WE CONSUME ON THIS ISLAND ARRIVE HERE BY SEA 
SO WHEN YOU GO SHOPPING IT'S ODDS ON THAT YOU'LL BE BUYING GOODS 
THAT CAME HERE BY SHIP IN BOXES LIKE THESE 
IN ALL MORE THAN FORTY PER CENT OF BRITAIN'S TRADE PASSES THROUGH THIS PORT 
AS WE PASS SOUTHEND WE HIT THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER 
THAT HAS ALWAYS PROVIDED THE LIFEBLOOD FOR LONDON THE THAMES 
BUT IT'S ALSO THE CAPITAL'S ACHILLES HEEL 
DOWN THE AGES ENEMIES HAVE USED IT TO STRIKE AT THE HEART OF THE NATION 
BANG IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ESTUARY LIE THE RED SAND FORTS 
ANTI AIRCRAFT PLATFORMS BUILT TO COUNTER LUFTWAFFE RAIDS 
THEY'VE SURVIVED THE ELEMENTS SINCE NINETEEN FORTY ONE 
BUT HISTORICALLY IT WAS THE ROYAL NAVY WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEFENDING THIS PART OF THE REALM 
OUR MARITIME SUPREMACY WAS HELD TOGETHER BY AN UNCELEBRATED 
BUT ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT OF SEAFARING LIFE 
IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU SEE A SHIP IN FULL SAIL THAT YOU APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF ROPE 
CHATHAM WAS ONE OF QUEEN ELIZABETH I.'S 
ORIGINAL ROYAL NAVAL PORTS 
WE PRESS GANGED ALICE ROBERTS TO UNRAVEL THE STORY OF THE HUMBLE ROPE 
IN THE DAYS OF SAIL THE ROYAL NAVY RELIED ON FOUR MAIN SUPPLIERS FOR ITS ROPE 
PORTSMOUTH PLYMOUTH AND WOOLWICH HAVE NOW CLOSED AND THE ONLY SITE STILL MAKING ROPE IS HERE AT CHATHAM 
IN FACT CHATHAM'S HISTORIC DOCKYARD HOUSES THE LAST TRADITIONAL WORKING ROPEWALK ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD 
SO IF YOU WANT YOUR ROPE THE OLD FASHIONED WAY THIS IS THE PLACE TO GET IT 
RICHARD HOLDSWORTH HAS WORKED AT THE DOCKYARD FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS 
IT'S SAFE TO SAY HE'S A MAN WHO KNOWS THE ROPES 
WELCOME TO THE ROPEWALK ALICE 
IT'S HUGE 
HOW LONG IS THIS BUILDING IT'S ONE ZERO ZERO ZERO F. T. LONG 
WHEN IT WAS BUILT IT WAS THE LONGEST BRICK BUILT BUILDING IN EUROPE 
I CAN BARELY SEE THE END OF IT IT'S ALONG WAY AWAY 
A COUPLE OF TRADITIONAL DOCKYARD BIKES 
THE ROOM HAD TO BE SO LONG BECAUSE ROPE FOR STRENGTH IS MADE IN ONE CONTINUOUS LENGTH 
THESE ARE THE BOBBIN BANKS THIS IS WHERE THE WHOLE OF THE PROCESS DOWN HERE STARTS 
THE FIBRES ARE BEING SPUN INTO YARN 
AND HERE THEY'RE BEING PASSED THROUGH 
THESE WONDERFUL COLANDER TYPE THINGS 
EVERY ROPE IS MADE TO BE SEVEN TWENTY F. T. LONG 
HISTORICALLY THAT'S THE STANDARD LENGTH THAT THE NAVY REQUIRED TO ANCHOR SHIPS IN FORTY FATHOMS 
THE ROOM'S OVER A ONE ZERO ZERO ZERO F. T. BECAUSE AS THE ROPE IS TWISTED TOGETHER IT SHORTENS 
AND NOW IT'S ALL GOING TO HAPPEN 
EACH OF THESE SIX STRANDS OF ROPE ARE GOING TO BE MADE INTO TWO ROPES 
AT THE FAR END RIGHT THE WAY DOWN THERE 
THESE THREE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TOGETHER TO A SINGLE HOOK 
AND AS IT TWISTS IT DRIVES THE TOP CART DOWN THE FLOOR 
THE ROPE THAT'S BEING MADE 
THERE'S NO OTHER MECHANICAL FORCE TO IT APART FROM THE TWIST OF THE ROPE 
SO IT'S A MECHANISED PROCESS BUT YOU NEED THAT BIT OF A HUMAN SKILL IN THERE THAT'S RIGHT 
WE NEED TO SQUEEZE IN HERE LET FRED BY 
AS YOU SEE THERE'S A NEW ROPE 
SO THE ROYAL NAVY TOTALLY RELIED ON THE STRENGTH OF THESE ROPES BEING MADE IN PLACES LIKE CHATHAM 
YES 
THE ROPEWALK AT CHATHAM SURVIVES BECAUSE ITS ROPE IS STILL IN DEMAND FOR THE WORLD'S FINEST SAILING SHIPS 
TWO NEW ROPES THERE YOU HAVE IT 
WE'RE NEARING THE END OF OUR JOURNEY NOW 
AND I'M RETURNING TO THE LOCATION 
WHERE OUR COASTAL ADVENTURES ORIGINALLY STARTED 
OVERLOOKING THE ENGLISH CHANNEL AT DOVER 
THE COASTGUARDS SAY NEGOTIATING THE ENGLISH CHANNEL IS LIKE WALKING ACROSS THE M. TWENTY FIVE 
THAT'S HOW BUSY IT IS 
FOR THE SIXTY PEOPLE EACH YEAR WHO ATTEMPT THE CHALLENGE OF THE CHANNEL SWIM 
DODGING THE ODD SHIP OR THREE IS ALL PART OF THE ADVENTURE 
THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL CHANNEL SWIM WAS JUST OVER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY YEARS AGO 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MERCHANT SEAMAN CAPTAIN MATTHEW WEBB 
TOILED FOR TWENTY ONE HOURS AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO REACH THE COAST OF FRANCE 
COMPLETING THIS SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE FEAT TURNED HIM INTO A SUPERSTAR 
IN A POSSIBLY FOOLISH BID TO FIND OUT WHAT WEBB WENT THROUGH 
I'M DIVING IN AT THE DEEP END WITH CHANNEL SWIMMER COACH GREG WHYTE 
TELL MY WIFE AND KIDS I LOVE THEM 
OH 
OH SWEET MERCY 
DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU JUST SPLASH YOUR FACE IN THE WATER 
IT FEELS QUITE COLD 
BUT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GET IN IT'S A NIGHTMARE 
LET'S GET MOVING TO WHERE 
LET'S GENERATE SOME HEAT I'M SO COLD I'VE FORGOTTEN HOW TO SWIM STRAIGHT TO SHORE LET'S GO 
I'VE BEEN GOING FIFTEEN MINUTES AND ALREADY I APPRECIATE WHY THE SUCCESS RATE IS LESS THAN TEN PER CENT 
IT'S SO COLD IT DRAINS EVERY OUNCE OF YOUR ENERGY 
I'M A PRETTY STRONG SWIMMER I USED TO BE A LIFEGUARD 
BUT THIS IS HARD 
I'M ON MY BACK 
JUST TO TRY AND BREATHE 
AND I'M ONLY HEADING FOR DOVER BEACH FROM INSIDE THE HARBOUR WALLS 
THAT IS ENOUGH FOR ME 
I'LL CATCH YOU ON THE BEACH 
BOTTOM TWO RUNGS ARE LOOSE BUT COME UP YOU'RE O. K. 
GET HIM WRAPPED AS SOON AS HE GETS OUT THERE YEP O. K. 
GRAB HOLD OF THAT YOU ALL RIGHT 
YEAH 
YOU'VE DONE WELL 
I TELL YOU WHAT ANYONE WHO'S EVER DONE THAT 
FROM CAPTAIN WEBB 
TO DAVID WALLIAMS AND ANYONE IN BETWEEN I'VE GOT THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR THEM 
BECAUSE THAT IS HARD 
AS I APPROACH THE END OF MY JOURNEY IT'S BACK TO WHAT HAS BECOME A FAMILIAR SIGHT FOR US COASTERS 
THE WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER 
SOLID DEPENDABLE 
THEY ARE JUST PART OF OUR EXTRAORDINARY AND EVER CHANGING COASTAL STORY 
A TALE PLAYED OUT WHERE THE LAND MEETS THE SEA 
AND WHERE BOTH MEET THE PEOPLE AROUND OUR SHORES 
THE FOLK AT THE EDGE OF OUR ISLES 
ALL I WANT TO DO NOW IS SEE MORE AND HEAR MORE STORIES 
THIS IS A WONDERFUL PLACE AND I JUST FEEL PROUD THAT I'M PART OF IT
