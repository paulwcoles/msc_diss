LUCK BE A LADY TONIGHT 
LUCK BE A LADY TONIGHT 
LUCK IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN A LADY TO BEGIN WITH 
LUCK BE A LADY TONIGHT 
A LADY DOESN'T LEAVE HER ESCORT

NEARLY CUT OFF HIS CIRCULATION THE 
THING THAT SURPRISED ME FOR WHAT 
ALL YOU HAVE

THE ANGER MANAGEMENT KICKING LUCKY IN DENISE JODIE OR SARAH DID THEY 
HAVE THE LEADING LADY PIZZAZ FOR 
THE WEST END 
THEY BOTH HAVE IT JODIE IT WAS 
LITTLE STRAINED AT THE TOP WITH A 
COUPLE OF THE NOTES YOU PULLED IT 
BACK IT IS A TOUGH SONG TO SING 
IT WAS FOR MAN I HAVE SEEN 
EUANMCGREGOR AND OTHERS SING IT BUT 
I PREFER YOUR VERSION I BELIEVED 
EVERY WORD EACH WEEK YOU ARE 
DEVELOPING INTO SUCH GOOD ACTRESS 
SARAH YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF TO 
ME AS A WONDERFUL SINGER AND 
ACTRESS I THINK YOU ARE SPECIAL YOU HAVE 
MAGICAL QUALITY 
WHEN YOU PERFORM YOU 
CONNECT WITH THE AUDIENCE AND MAKE 
EVERYTHING VERY BELIEVABLE BE 
CAREFUL YOU DON'T OVERPRONOUNCE 
YOUR WORDS SOMETIMES IT MAKES YOU 
SOUND MORE MARY POPPINS THAN NANCY 
LET'S MOVE ON TO BARRY 
YOU CAN ALL 
SING WONDERFULLY THIS IS NOW ABOUT 
ACTING I THINK BOTH I THOUGHT 
GAVE VERY GOOD PERFORMANCES AND 
TOOK ON BOARD THE POINTS THAT 
ANDREW 
WAS MAKING L. L. THINK JODIE IT WAS A VERY INTELLIGENT READING OF 
THAT SONG AND ALL THAT JOKEY JODIE 
WAS UNDER WRAPS WHICH WAS VERY 
PLEASED TO SEE 
SARAH I JUST FEEL THAT YOU STILL 
HAVE A LIMITED RANGE OF EXPRESSIONS 
I YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL ON TELEVISION 
IN THE THEATRE IN A BIG THEATRE IT 
REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW WELL YOU 
WOULD REGISTER BUT YOU DID GIVE A 
VERY GOOD ACTING PERFORMANCE THEN I 
THOUGHT 
DOUBTS FROM BARRY JOHN THOUGHT AT 
THE TOP JODIE LITTLE WARBLE ON THE HIGH NOTES WE ARE LOOKING 
ACTING EVERY WEEK YOU MAKE THE 
SONG 
YOUR OWN 
YOU DID WHAT ANDREW 
WANTED YOU TO DO YOU HAVE LEADING 
LADY 
QUALITY SARAH 
I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT PLANET BARRY IS ON THE SHOW 
AND PERFORMANCE ON I SAW MR. BO 
JANGLES YOU HAD MULTIPLE 
EXPRESSIONS THEY WOULD BE SEEN 
FROM THE BACK OF THE STALLS

AND SARAH TAKE ON BOARD YOUR NOTES 
MY HEART WAS IN MY MOUTH TO HEAR 
YOU SING BECAUSE OF ALL THE WORK

TO GO OVER THE TOP AND 
NOT DRAW US INTO THE STORY ABOUT 
WHO 
LUCK IS 
WE KNOW 
IT IS ABOUT 
SOMEBODY PLAYING CARDS 
YOU DID 
VERY 
WELL I 
THINK THERE IS A GOOD 
POINT 
THAT BARRY 
MAKES ABOUT 
HITTING THE 
BACK OF 
THE THEATRE 
IF 
THAT IS 
THE CASE IT IS MY FAULT I 
ASKED YOU NOT TO 
BRING IT 
BECAUSE WE ARE 
ON TELEVISION 
WE 
HAVE LIVE SHOW ON TELEVISION TO 
AN AUDIENCE WHICH IS REAL AND WE HAVE TO SOME 
TIMES REMEMBER 
IS A BIG 
THEATRE WE

IN THE BOTTOM TWO I COULDN'T 
BELIEVE IT THAT WAS A VERY VERY 
GOOD INTELLIGENT AND LYRICAL 
READING OF THAT GREAT SONG BY 
GERSHWIN CONGRATULATIONS NIAMH 
JOHN 
NIAMH LAST WEEK YOU SAID JOHN THAT YOU FELT IT IN YOUR BONES THAT 
YOU WOULD BE IN THE 
BOTTOM TWO 
WELL

NOT DESERVE 
TO 
BE IN 
THE 
BOTTOM TWO 
THIS WEEK 
YOU NATIONWIDE TO BE RIGHT OUT 
THERE IN

PUBLIC IT 
IS THE 
PUBLIC THAT NIAMH NEEDS 
TO TURN 
AROUND DO YOU THINK THAT 
PERFORMANCE DID ENOUGH 
IT IS SO 
WONDER TO SEE SOMEBODY ABSORB 
EVERYTHING AND WE WORKED SO HARD 
I FEEL SO NERVOUS I WANTED TO BE 
ON STAGE YOU WENT ACROSS THE 
PHRASE JUST AS I 
ASKED YOU 
IT WAS 
GREAT THE INTELLIGENCE IS THERE

ACTING IS

CONCERN 
A LITTLE 
BIT AT 
THE MOMENT

AGE AND 
WHETHER OR

VOICE IS QUITE STRONG ENOUGH 
GOODNESS ME BARBRA STREISAND

THE NUMBER FOR LATER 
DON'T ALL NOW AS THE VOTE WON'T

COUNTY KERRY'S JESSIE AND FALKIRK'S 
ASHLEY ASHLEY YOU HAVE A VERY DISTINCTIVE QUALITY

YOUR ESSENCE 
I JUST WANTED TO FIND ME AGAIN I 
FEEL LIKE I'M COMPLETELY LOST 
JESSIE HOW ARE YOU 
THE DREAMS YOU DREAM HAVE ALL 
GONE ASTRAY 
I HAVE GOT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO 
SAY TO YOU IT WAS ABSOLUTELY 
BRILLIANT I HAVE TEARS IN MY EYES 
I'VE TEARS IN MY EYES TOO

THE LORD CRY I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT 
JUST KEEP IT LIKE THAT DON'T 
LESSEN TO ANYBODY 
SHE AS AN EXTRAORDINARY ARTIST SHE 
MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE MEDLED 
WITH PEOPLE LIKE ME IF THAT IS THE 
REAL JESSIE WHICH I SUSPECT IT IS 
DON'T LOSE T. 
I THOUGHT BEING MYSELF 
WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH I HAVE DECIDED 
TO STEP MYSELF I'M LOOKING FORWARD 
TO STEPPING INTO JESSIE'S SHOE ON 
SATURDAY NIGHT 
ASHLEY IT'S JUST NOT CONNECTING IF IF I WAS IN THE BOTTOM TWO I WOULD BE 
A GONER THEN I THOUGHT COME ON 
PUBLIC DISAGREE 
WITH HIM 
HELP ME 
OUT AND THEY DID 
EVERY TIME THE PUBLIC DO THAT IT 
GIVES ME ANOTHER CHANCE TO TRY TO 
WIN ANDREW OVER 
I DON'T BELIEVE 
YOU COULD HOLD AN AUDIENCE I DON'T 
RATE YOUR VOICE 
NOTHING PERSONAL 
I DO THINK YOU ARE EXTREMELY 
TALENTS YOU DON'T REALISE WHAT I 
WANT MAKE IT REALLY NAUGHTY 
HEY BIG SPENDER 
SPEND LITTLE TIME WITH ME 
CAN I PUNCH THE AIR 
I SOME WHAT EAT MY WORDS I'M 
SEEING SOMETHING NOW WHICH I HADN'T 
SEEN BEFORE I'M REALLY PLEASED 
WITH HER L. THINK 
SHE COULD 
GO MUCH 
FURTHER THAN I THOUGHT 
THE LORD MOVES IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS 
JESSIE IS PERFORMING THE MAN THAT 
GOT AWAY AND ASHLEY BIG SPENDER 
WHY THESE SONGS 
JESSIE HAS A JUDY 
GARLAND SONG AT HER PEEK AND A 
VERY DIFFICULT SONG TO SING BIG 
SPENDER IS A CHORUS NUMBER AND I 
WANT TO SEE HER MAKE IT HER OWN 
FIRST UP IS JESSCY 
THE NIGHT IS BITTER 
THE STARS HAVE LOST THEIR GLITTER 
THE WINDS GROW COLDER 
AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE OLDER 
AND ALL BECAUSE OF THE MAN THAT GOT AWAY 
NO MORE HIS EAGER CALL 
THE WRITING'S ON THE WALL 
THE DREAMS YOU DREAMED HAVE ALL 
GONE ASTRAY 
THE ROAD GETS ROUGHER 
IT'S LONELIER AND TOUGHER 
WITH HOPE YOU BURN UP 
TOMORROW HE MAY TURN UP 
THERE'S JUST NO LET UP THE LIVE LONG NIGHT AND DAY 
THERE IS NOTHING SADDER THAN 
A ONE MAN WOMAN LOOKING FOR 
THE MAN THAT GOT AWAY 
THE MAN THAT GOT AWAY 
THE MINUTE YOU WALKED IN THE JOINT 
THE MAN THAT GOT AWAY 
THE MINUTE YOU WALKED IN THE JOINT 
I COULD SEE YOU WERE A MAN OF DISTINCTION 
A REAL BIG SPENDER

A REAL BIG SPENDER
