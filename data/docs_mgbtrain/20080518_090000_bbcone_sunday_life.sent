THE DEATH OF SIXTEEN YEAR OLD JIMMY 
MIZEN IN LONDON LAST WEEK HAS HAD 
A HUGE IMPACT JIMMY WAS KILLED ON 
A VISIT TO BAKERY THE ATTITUDE 
OF HIS MOTHER MARGARET TOWARDS 
THE KILLER WAS REMARKABLE 
I FEEL FOR THE PARENTS OF THIS BOY 
I DON'T KNOW WHY I CAN'T GET THEM 
OUT OF MY MIND WE WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED TO JIMMY IS THE WORST 
THING POSSIBLE BUT WE HAVE SUCH 
WONDERFUL MEMORIES THEY HAVE NOT 
WONDERFUL MEMORIES FOR THEIR SON 
ALL THEY CAN THINK ABOUT IS THE 
EVIL HE HAS DONE SO MY PRAYERS 
WITH ARE WITH THE FAMILY 
MARGARET MIZEN SHE AND HER FAMILY 
ARE GOING THROUGH ENORMOUS STRESS 
TOMORROW A PLAY OPENS IN LONDON 
THAT LOOKS AT HOW FAMILY COPES 
AFTER A SON IS KNIFED TO DEATH THE 
LONG ROAD IS ONE OF THE MOST 
DIFFICULT ISSUES OF ALL 
FORGIVENESS FORGIVENESS DANNY'S MOTHER PLAYED BY FORMER 
CORONATION STREET ACTRESS DENISE 
BLACK HAS HAD ROW WITH HER 
HUSBAND HE HAS FOUND LETTER THAT 
SHE WROTE TO THE GIRL WHO KILLED 
THEIR SON THE OTHER SON WANTS TO 
KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON 
WHAT HAPPENED 
HE FOUND A LETTER 
THAT I WROTE TO EMMA PRICE HE 
THINKS 
I WANT TO FORGIVE HER DO DO YOU I DON'T KNOW L. WANT TO BE YOU FREE 
OF WHAT 
AS LONG AS I AM FREE SHACKLETED TO HER I AM SHACKLED TO 
DANNY'S MURDER IT IS MORE THAN THAT 
IT IS ABOUT THE MOTHER NEEDING 
CONTACT WITH THE GIRL WHO DID IT 
FOR PERSONAL REASONS SHE CAN'T 
MAKE SENSE OF ANYTHING 
IT IS A PLAY ABOUT FORGIVENESS HOW 
THE PEOPLE TACKLE IT YES 
WERE YOU ABLE TO DO THAT 
I HEARD 
ABOUT THE FORGIVENESS PROJECT 
BECAUSE OF TUTU WHAT ARE YOU GOING 
TO DO WITH TWO SIDES FAR APART 
THAT DECISION WHETHER OR NOT YOU 
DO CHOOSE TO FORGIVE SOMEBODY AS 
WELL I KNOW YOU HAVE SPOKEN WITH 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO DO THAT 
IT'S A DIFFICULT DECISION 
WE TRIED 
TO SET UP THAT DEBATE IN THE PLAY 
SO THAT THE FATHER IN THE PLAY HE 
DOESN'T WANT TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD 
IT'S A KIND OF VERY VALID POINT OF 
VIEW AS WELL 
YOU CAN COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT 
YET YOU HAVE THE MOTHER WHO DOES 
WANT TO GO THAT JOURNEY 
IT'S ACTUALLY VERY DIFFICULT AND 
DIFFERENT TO WHAT SHE IMAGINES AS 
WELL WELL THANK YOU FOR AGREEING TO MEET ME 
WHATEVER WHATEVER AUTO I'M GLAD YOU DID ARE YOU AM AM I WHAT 
GLAD THAT WE CAN MEET 
ARE YOU NERVOUS 
WHAT ABOUT 
MEETING ME 
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME 
DOESN'T IT NO NO DANNY WAS OUR YOUNGEST SON YEAH YEAH WE'VE GOT ANOTHER SON JOE HE'S TWENTY 
RIGHT 
DANNY WAS GOING TO RIGHT UNIVERSITY 
GOOD FOR HIM 
DO YOU UNIVERSITY THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO 
IS FORGIVENESS A WAY FORWARD DOES 
IT HELP THINGS 
ONE THING WE HAVE 
LOOKED AT IN THE PLAY IT DOESN'T 
CHANGE THE HORROR OF WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED OR IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE 
PAST AND IT DIDN'T TAKE THE GRIEF 
AWAY BUT IT'S ABOUT MOVING FORWARD 
DESMOND TUTU SAYS WITHOUT 
FORGIVENESS THERE IS NOT ANY 
FUTURE HIS POINT OF VIEW IS THAT 
IT CREATES A BETTER FUTURE L. THINK 
SO I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I COULD DO 
IT MYSELF 
FASCINATING TO TALK TO 
YOU THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH 
THERE'S A QUESTION CAN YOU DO IT 
YOURSELF WITH US ARE TWO MOTHERS 
WHO HAVE KNOWN THE TRAUMA OF HAVING 
THEIR CHILD MURDERED GEE WALKER IS 
THE MOTHER OF ANTHONY WALKER WHO 
SET UP A FOUNDATION IN HIS NAME AND 
ANNE MING WHO AFTER THE DEATH OF 
HER 
D. A. GHTER 
JULIE FOUGHT A SEVENTEEN 
YEAR BAT TOLL BRING HER KILLER TO 
JUSTICE GEE I KNOW YOU HAVE 
FORGIVEN EXPLAIN HOW YOU FOUND IT 
IN YOUR HEART TO BE ABLE TO DO 
THAT 
FORGIVENESS HAS BEEN A PART THAT OF MY LIFE AND MY CHILDREN'S LIFE 
BECAUSE I WAS RAISED AS MY 
GRANDMOTHER BROUGHT US UP AS 
BAPTIST LATER ON AS I GREW UP I 
WENT INTO PENTECOSTAL IT'S BEEN A 
PART OF MY LIFE 
IT'S PART OF YOUR 
FAITH BEING ABLE TO FORGIVE HOW 
HAS THAT CHANGED YOUR LIFE DO YOU 
THINK 
FORGIVENESS I BELIEVE GRIEF THINK IS ENOUGH IT WAS SO MUCH TO CARRY 
I ALWAYS SAY MOO TO MY CHILDREN 
GRIEF HAS MANY FACES THAT WAS SO 
MUCH TO DEAL WITH L. CHOSE NOT TO 
TAKE ON THE EXTRA BAGGAGE 
FORGIVENESS CARRIES BAGGAGE THEY 
SAID IT'S CONNECTED WITH ANGER 
WITH SENTIMENT AND THIS PLOT FOR 
REVENGE I THOUGHT THAT'S TOO MUCH 
TO COPE WITH L. COULDN'T CARRY THE 
EXCESS I CHOSE TO GO DOWN THE PATH 
OF FORGIVENESS 
ANNE YOU LOST A 
CHILD UNDER THOSE KIND OF TRAGIC 
CIRCUMSTANCES CAN YOU FORGIVE NO NO NEVER I FEEL AS THOUGH WHY SHOULD 
I FORGIVE HIM L. FEEL IF I FORGIVE 
HIM IT'S AS THOUGH I'M ACCEPTING 
WHAT HE DID TO OUR JULIE OR THAT 
IT WAS ALL RIGHT AND IT WASN'T I'M I'M INTERESTED ON YOUR POINT OF VIEW ON 
THAT DO YOU THINK FORGIVENESS IS A 
FORM OF ACCEPTING THINGS AND 
ACCEPTING THINGS WERE RIGHT I I BELIEVE THAT IS A MISCONCEPTION 
IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM L. BELIEVE 
FORGIVENESS IS ABOUT ME HELPING ME 
TO CARRY MY PAIN IN THE MIDST OF 
IT THE PATH I CHOSE HAS GIVEN ME 
AN INNER PEACE THAT ENABLED ME 
EACH DAY TO COPE WITH WHATEVER L. 
PICTURE MYSELF IN AN OCEAN OF YOU 
DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO COME 
ALONG WHETHER YOU ARE GOING TO 
I CHOSE EITHER YOU SWIM OR YOU GO 
UNDER I CHOSE TO SWIM 
DO YOU FEEL 
ANNE IN SOME WAYS DOES IT TIE YOU 
TO HIM THE FACT YOU DON'T FORGIVE 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT 
I FEEL 
AS THOUGH I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE 
WHAT HE DID AND THE PAIN IT'S 
CAUSED I JUST DON'T FEEL ABLE TO 
FORGIVE HIM 
ALSO IN THE PLAY WE 
SAW A LITTLE BIT EXTRACT OF THE 
PLAY THERE THE MOTHER CHOOSES TO 
GO AND MEET HER CHILD'S KILLER THE 
YOUNG GIRL WE SAW IN THAT IS THAT 
SOMETHING YOU HAVE CONSIDERED YES YES YOU WOULD LIKE TO 
I WOULD LIKE TO 
NOBODY ELSE IN MY FAMILY WANT 
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT L. WANT TO 
HEAR IN HIS OWN WORDS WHAT HE DID 
THE FACT IN OUR CASE FOR THREE 
MONTHS HER BODY LAY UNDETECTED 
BEHIND THE BATH L. FOUND HER HE 
KNEW WHERE HER BODY WAS IN THAT 
THREE MONTHS IF HE FELT ANY FORM 
OF REMORSE HE COULD HAVE MADE AN 
ANONYMOUS PHONE CALL TO THE POLICE 
I MIGHT HAVE FELT A BIT DIFFERENT 
WE HAD THREE MONTHS NOT KNOWING 
WHERE HER BODY WAS 
GEE WOULD YOU 
LIKE TO MEET THE MURDERER 
I SAID 
THAT FROM THE OFFSET I WOULD LIKE 
TO BUT I SUPPOSE IN MY OWN TIME 
I PRAY THAT BY THE TIME I GET ROUND 
TO DOING IT THEY WOULD WANT TO SEE 
ME IT'S A TWO WAY THING L. WOULD 
LIKE TO BECAUSE THESE ARE CHILDREN 
THAT I SAW GROW THEY GREW 
ALONGSIDE MY KIDS I'D LIKE TO KNOW 
WHAT WENT WRONG L. WANT TO KNOW WHY 
THEY DID IT TO MY BOY TALKING TALKING ABOUT FORGIVENESS IF YOU SAW HIM 
WOULD YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY YOU DO 
NOW 
THE WAY I FEEL AT THE MOMENT I NOW JUST FEEL AS I COULD NEVER FORGIVE 
HIM FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE TO OUR 
DAUGHTER 
WOULD IT MAKE A DAUGHTER DIFFERENCE TO YOU TO MOVE ON IN A 
DIFFERENT WAY IF YOU MET HIM NOW I I DON'T THINK YOU CAN MOVE ON YOU 
HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE WITH WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED YOU DO THE LIFE SENTENCE 
NOT THE PERPETRATOR 
SPEAKING TO 
YOU FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES 
IT'S EVERYBODY'S INDIVIDUAL 
DECISION WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO DO IT IT IS YEAH WE'VE BEEN CHATTING TO 
EACH OTHER WE'VE AGREED NOT TO 
ARGUE ARGUE IT'S OUR CHOICE WHO IS TO SAY WHO 
IS RIGHT AND WHO IS WRONG 
ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING TALKING TO 
YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR 
TIME TIME THAT PLAY THAT WE WERE JUST TALKING 
ABOUT EARLIER THE LONG ROAD OPENS 
AT THE SEW SHOW THEATRE TOMORROW 
IT RUNS UNTIL THE FIFTH JUNE MORE 
DETAILS OF THAT CAN BE FOUND ON OUR 
WEBSITE IT RUNS AT THE SOHO 
THEATRE THEATRE HERE'S REMINDER OF HOW YOU CAN GET 
IN TOUCH WITH US 
NOW FOR A LOOK AT THE SUNDAY PAPERS 
TO SEE WHAT ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS 
ISSUES ARE MAKING HEADLINES OUR 
GUESTS COME FROM DIFFERENT 
PERSPECTIVES ONE IS A MAGISTRATE 
SALIM HAFERGEE THE OTHER IS POET 
BENJAMIN ZEPHANIAH GOOD MORNING TO 
YOU BOTH 
GOOD MORNING 
WHERE DO 
YOU WANT TO START WITH CHINA 
CHINA IS ALL OVER THE PAPERS AS IT 
HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF 
DAYS SO IT SHOULD BE WHAT I'M 
INTERESTED IS IN IS THE FIGURES 
SAYING THAT THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE BEING 
FOUND DEAD AND THERE'S PROBABLY 
ANOTHER TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THE CHINESE 
AUTHORITIES RECKON WHAT FASCINATES 
ME IS THE STORY BEHIND THE FIGURES 
EACH ONE OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE A 
FAMILY AND PEOPLE WHO CARED FOR 
THEM IT'S INTERESTING IN THE 
OBSERVER TODAY THEY'VE TALKED TO A 
COUPLE PEOPLE THERE IS A MR. WU 
HERE FOR EXAMPLE WHO TALKS ABOUT 
AS SOON AS ROAD IS FINISHED AS 
SOON AS IT'S MENDED HE WILL GO 
THERE AND REBUILD HIS HOUSE THEY 
ASKED HIM ARE AREN'T YOU AFRAID 
HE SAID I'VE SEEN SO MANY DEAD 
BODIES IN THE LAST FEW YEARS I 
FEAR NOTHING NO MORE I SAW IMAGES 
OF THIS ON TELEVISION JUST SPORTS 
HALLS FULL OF KIDS JUST SITTING 
THERE WAITING TO BE CLAIMED 
COULD YOU IMAGINE JUST SITTING 
THERE 
IT'S THAT INDIVIDUAL THAT THERE MAKES THE STORY TO IMAGINE THIRTY THOUSAND 
PEOPLE IT'S DIFFICULT TO KPRAE 
HEND 
YES L. L. SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN HEND CHINA IT'S A MISUNDERSTOOD PLACE 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BE ALONE L. 
GO UP TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAINS 
TO DO MARTIAL ARTS ON MY OWN A 
CHINAMAN WILL COME FROM BENEATH A 
ROCK THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE 
THERE OVER ONE BILLION PEOPLE 
ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS THERE IF 
THERE IS A ROAD ACCIDENT HUNDREDS 
TURN UP ANY LITTLE THING IT'S 
ALWAYS A LOT OF PEOPLE TO GO THERE 
I WANT TO BORROW THAT OFF YOU WHILE 
WE TALK TO SALIM YOU WENT TO 
PAKISTAN AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE 
THERE 
YES I DID L. WENT TO THERE PAKISTAN ON ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE 
VISIT BUT FOR ME WHAT KIND OF 
REALLY TOUCHED MY HEART WAS THE 
COMMITMENT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE 
WORKING THE INTERNATIONAL AID 
AGENCIES AND ALSO WHEN YOU SEE THE 
HEARTS AND MINDS OF PEOPLE FOR ME 
LITTLE MIRACLE STORIES 
PARTICULARLY LIKE IN CHINA WHEN A 
YOUNG PERSON OR AN ELDERLY MEMBER 
IS FOUND THOSE KIND OF LITTLE 
NUGGETS KEEPS THE ENTHUSIASM AND 
THE SPIRIT AND THE HOPE IN PEOPLE 
TO CARRY ON GOING IN THERE IN 
TERMS OF PAKISTAN WHAT IMPRESSED 
ME WAS THE MOBILISATION 
PARTICULARLY IN THE U. K. OF NOT JUST 
THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY BUT THE WIDER 
COMMUNITIES THROUGH MOSQUES AND 
THROUGH CHURCHES AND THROUGH 
COMMUNITY SUPPORT TO GIVE AID THAT 
IS ABOUT THE HUMAN SPIRIT COMING 
DOWN TO COMMUNITY LEVEL 
I HEARD PEOPLE FROM CHINA TALKING 
ABOUT THAT COMMUNITY SPIRIT THAT 
NOW EXISTS BECAUSE OF THIS DREADFUL 
THING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM 
IT'SS IF CRANIATING THE WAY PEOPLE 
PULL TOGETHER FEEL RATHER GUILTY 
I LIVE OUT IN LINCOLNSHIRE NOT SO 
LONG AGO WE HAD AN EARTHQUAKE IT 
WAS ONE HUNDRED A M. IN THE MORNING I WAS 
AWAKE I WAS SO TRAUMATISED BUT 
IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS A A DIRECT CONTRAST TO WHAT IS GOING ON 
IN BURMA THE CAMERAS ARE NOT THERE 
AND WE CAN'T GET A GRASP OF WHAT IS 
GOING ON 
THAT IS VERY VERY SAD 
THERE IS A WHOLE POLITICAL HISTORY 
BEHIND THIS WHICH WE HAVEN'T 
EXPLORED I WOULD SAY THAT PEOPLE 
WHO ARE SAYING THAT BURMA IS A 
HORRIBLE PLACE THEY NEED TO WAIT 
LOOK AT NEW ORLEANS THAT IS MAINLY 
A BLACK COMMUNITY LOOK HOW LONG IT 
TOOK TO RESCUE THEM 
LET'S LOOK AT 
THE DALL LA LLAMA ALL OF THE 
PICTURES OF HIM WITH FROM NAOMI 
CAMPBELL TO THE POPE HE IS 
EXTRAORDINARY THIS INFLUENCE WHAT WHAT YOU CAN SEE ABOUT THE DALL LIE 
LLAMA IS PROBABLY SOME OF THOSE 
CORE VALUES YOU COULD SEE IN OTHER 
WORLD LEADERS LIKE NELSON MANDELA 
DIALOGUE AND COMMUNICATION IS THE KEY TO NEGOTIATIONS FOR ME HE 
SUMMED IT UP IN ONE OF THE 
STATEMENTS HE MADE ANGER WORKS 
AGAIN THE PERSON WHO FEELS IT AND 
VIOLENCE BREEDS VIOLENCE 
UNFORTUNATELY AT PRESENT IN TERMS 
OF NAL AND INTERNATIONAL POLICY WE 
SEE THE LATTER IT'S AMAZING HE HAS 
SOME OF THE MEDIA ATTENTION AROUND 
THE PEACE PROCESS 
YOU KNOW HIM 
POETS AND MUSICIANS 
WANT THEIR PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN WITH 
HIM EVERYONE SAYS HE IS THE NICEST 
PERSON IN THE WORLD 
GOING BACK TO 
CHINA 
HE OBVIOUSLY HAS THIS BIG CHINA ISSUE ABOUT TIBET YOU COULD SAY 
THE CHINESE ARE HIS ENEMIES BUT 
HE LOVES THEM SO MUCH WHEN YOU 
HAVE SOMEONE WHO LOVES THEIR 
ENEMIES SO POWERFULLY IT'S VERY 
DIFFICULT NOT TO LIKE HIM A LOT OF 
PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND HIM THE 
FREE TIBET MOVEMENT AROUND THE 
WORLD DOES NOT REALLY UNDERSTAND 
HIM 
HE IS COMING TO BRITAIN HOPE HIM FOR DOOMED YOUTH ANTHONY HOROWITZ 
WENT INTO A JAIL AND MET PEOPLE HE 
CAME OUT WITH AN OPTIMISTIC VIEW I I THINK HE ACTUALLY WENT INTO A 
MAGISTRATES' COURT 
ALL RIGHT YOU 
TELL ME YOU ARE 
A MAGISTRATE I'M I'M A MAGISTRATE UNFORTUNATELY I 
DON'T WORK WITHIN THE YOUTH COURTS 
FOR ME WHAT WAS REFRESHING HE 
WENT TO A CLOSED COURT WHERE YOU 
WOULD THINK HE WOULD COME OUT WITH 
EXPERIENCES THAT ALL YOUNG PEOPLE 
ARE DEMONIC AND ARE INVOLVED IN 
CRIME AND ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR BUT 
HE CAME OUT AND SAID THESE YOUNG 
PEOPLE ARE VULNERABLE YOUNG PEOPLE 
AND UNFORTUNATELY LIKE MANY YOUNG 
PEOPLE GROWING UP ARE DOING RISKY 
THINGS IT INTERESTING FROM THINGS YOUR POINT OF VIEW RISKY THINGS 
BUT IS IT ACCEPTABLE TO DO THEM I I DID A LOT OF BAD THINGS L. WENT 
INTO CARE AND WENT TO BORSTAL L. 
WAS IN FRONT OF THE MAGISTRATES 
FOR AMERICAS I HAD A LITTLE BIT OF 
TALENT AND SOMETHING TO DO I 
MANAGED TO FIND A WAY OF 
CHANNELLING MY ENERGY ALL OF THESE 
KIDS HAVE ENERGY YOU CAN CHANNEL 
IT NEGATIVELY OR POSITIVELY L. WAS 
JUST LUCKY THE THING IS THIS IS A 
GREAT ARTICLE THE FACT IS HE WENT 
TO THE COURT HE DIDN'T GO TO A 
PLACE WHERE ALL OF THE KID ARE 
HAPPY ABSOLUTELY L. L. HAVE TO SAY HAPPY ABSOLUTELY WHEN KIDS ARE BEING GOOD YOU DON'T 
FIND A HEADLINE SAYING TODAY IN 
BRADFORD ALL OF THE KIDS ARE 
REALLY NICE 
ON THAT OPTIMISTIC 
NOTE WE WILL LEAVE IT THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH

MOTIVATING AND EVEN INSPIRATIONAL 
IT CAN ALSO TRANSFORM LIVES WHEN 
USED AS THERAPY FOR CHILDREN WITH 
SPECIAL NEEDS ONE OF THE PIONEERS 
IN THIS FIELD IS CHARITY NORDOFF 
ROBBINS AND FORMER G. FOUR PAUL NORDOFF 
A PATIENT WHO VISITED THEIR THERAPY 
SESSION FOR US AT SUNDAY LIFE 
HERE IN MANCHESTER THE SINGER 
JONATHAN ANSELL IS MAKING A VISIT 
TO FIND OUT HOW MUSIC IS CHANGING 
THE CHILDRENS' LIVES 
I CAN FINALLY HEAR THEM I CAN'T 
WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE CHILDREN ARE 
DOING TODAY 
HELL OW 
H. HELLO HELLO THIS THIS SCHOOL IS FOR CHILDREN WITH COMPLEX 
LEARNING DIFFICULTIES ESPECIALLY 
WITH AUTISTIC SPECTRUM DISORDER 
BUT WITH THE HELP OF THE THERAPY 
THESE CHILDREN ARE HELPING TO 
COMMUNICATE THROUGH MUSIC THESE 
ARE JUST SOME OF THE CHILDREN IN 
THE SCHOOL LEARNING CLASSICAL MUSIC 
FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS THROUGH 
THE RHYTHMS OF THE MUSIC THE 
CHILDREN ARE LEARNING TO 
COMMUNICATE THEIR FEELINGS 
IF THEY SMILE IF THEY SHOW 
ENJOYMENT AND FUN THAT IS VERY 
POWERFUL AND VERY VERY MOVING 
FUN BUT EVEN JONATHAN ANSELL CAN 
FIND THE LYRICS CHALLENGING 
POUR ON WATER 
FETCH THE ENGINES FIRE FIRE 
POUR ON WATER POUR ON WATER IT IT IS SO WONDERFUL TO SEE A CHILD WHO 
YOU HAVE KNOWN SEEN STRUGGLE COMING 
INTO A SESSION AND ENJOY IT AND 
COME OUT SMILING 
WELL DONE 
IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE 
KIDS ARE HAVING FUN WHAT ELSE DO 
THEY GET OUT OF IT 
THEY GET A HUGE 
AMOUNT OF FOCUS IT IS HARD FOR THE 
AUTOAUTOSTATISTIC CHILDREN TO FOCUS 
MOVEMENTS AND IN THEIR BRAINS FOR A 
LONG PERIOD OF TIME BUT IT WAS 
STPAK TO SEE THEM FOCUSED AND 
EXCITED ABOUT THE CONCEPT 
FANTASTIC TO SEE THEM FOCUSED AND 
EXCITED ABOUT THE CONCEPT FOR TWENTY 
MINUTES OF THE DAY THEY ARE IN 
THERE HAVING FUN WITH MUSIC 
INSPIRING THEMSELVES IT IS NOT JUST 
THROUGH THE MUSIC THAT IS HELPING 
THEM IT HELPS THEM WITH THE FOCUS 
THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES IN THE 
SCHOOL AND IN INTERACTION 
YOU SOUND AS IF YOU HAVE A PASSION 
FOR IT HOW 
DID YOU GET INVOLVED I I DID A CONCERT IN THE HARD ROCK CAFE 
FOR NORDOFF ROBBINS A LOAD OF 
FRIENDS COME DOWN SOLD A LOAD OF 
TICKETS AND RAISED LOADS OF MONEY 
AND GOT EXCITED ABOUT THE PROJECT 
FROM THERE L. HAVE DONE A FEW MORE 
PERFORMANCES FOR THEM TRYING TO 
RAISE THEIR PROFESSIONAL TRYING TO 
RAISE THE CASH AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 
UNFORTUNATELY THE SCHOOLS DON'T 
GET ENOUGH TIME WITH IT THEY ARE 
GETTING A DAY AND A HALF WITH THE 
SCHOOLS AS YOU SAW THERE IN 
MANCHESTER IT IS EVIDENT THROUGH 
THE TEACHERS THE PUPILS THE 
FANTASTIC WORK IT IS DOING FOR THEM

COUNTRY 
ITS IT IS THE BIGGEST COUNTRY MUSIC THERAPY IN THE COUNTRY THEY 
ARE DOING AMAZING WORK THROUGHOUT 
ALL THE SCHOOLS IN PARTICULAR WITH 
THE SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN SOME 
ONE TO ONE AND IN OTHERS IN GROUPS 
IT COVERS THE WHOLE SPAN IT WILL 
BE GREAT FOR OTHER CHILDREN ARE NO 
ARE NOT NECESSARILY DISABLED BUT 
GETTING INVOLVED EXPANDING IT IT 
GIVES EVERYONE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE 
INVOLVED IN MUSIC TO HAVE 
SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO EACH 
WEEK WEEK YOU KNOW WHAT EVERYBODY IS 
ENJOYING THAT WE HAVE SEEN THAT 
THE KIDS ARE APPRECIATING YOUR HARD 
WORK TOO 
THANK YOU 
LET'S CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT 
SAFE SAVE SAVIOUR SIBLINGS WE 
HEARD FROM THE PARENTS OF JAMIE AND 
CHARLIE WE HAVE HAD LOTS OF E. 
MAILS FROM YOU 
MARK FROM CEEF TEXTED IN IF YOU 
BELIEVE THAT LIFE STARTS AT 
CONCEPTION LIFE IS TAKEN FROM LIFE 
TO PRESERVE LIFE IT IS NOT 
ACCEPTABLE ACCEPTABLE EMMA HALL SAYS WITHOUT STEM CELL 
TESTS THERE WILL NEVER ABCURE FOR 
THIS DISEASE SHE IS BEG ARE FOR 
THIS TO GO AHEAD SO VERY VERY 
DIFFERENT VIEWS FROM YOU WE ARE 
JOINED BY DOCTOR ANDREW FERGUSSON FROM 
THE CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP AND BY DOCTOR 
ALLAN PACEY FROM THE BRITISH 
FERTILITY SOCIETY GOOD MORNING 
THAT YOU VERY MUCH WE IS SEEN AN 
EXTRAORDINARY EXAMPLE OF YOUNG 
CHARLIE WHO HAS BEEN SAVED BY HIS 
BROTHER DO YOU THINK THIS IS A 
GOOD IDEA 
I THIS IT IS FASCINATING 
THAT THE TITLE WE USE FOR THE 
DISCUSSION SAVIOUR SIBLINGS HAS 
AN ECHO OF RELIGIOUS BELIEF AND 
FAITH IN IT IT IS CLEARLY A 
PROFOUND MATTER WITH A LOT OF DO I 
MENTIONS JAYSON AND MICHELLE ARE 
LOVING THOUGHTFUL CARING MORAL 
PARENTS THEY ARE A LOVELY FAMILY 
WE 
HAVE SEEN THAT THIS MORNING L. HAVE BEEN WATCHING THEM IN THE 
STUDIO BEFOREHAND BUT THERE ARE 
BIG ISSUES RAISED WE ARE CONCERNED 
THAT THE DEBATE IN THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS TOMORROW IS NOT JUST 
BRINGING INTO LAW FOR THE FIRST 
TIME WHAT THE WHITTAKER FAMILY DID 
BUT IT WILL TAKE IT A LOT FURTHER 
WE HAVE HAD GORDON BROWN ONE OF 
THE NEWPAPERS SAYING THAT THE 
TREATMENTS WILL SAVE AND TRANSFORM 
MILLIONS OF LIVES YOU WOULD CHOOSE 
NOT TO DO THAT 
THAT IS AN EXTREME 
PIECE OF HYPERBOLE THAT I FEAR 
THAT GORDON BROWN WILL LIVE TO 
REGRET THE PROBLEM WITH THE BILL 
IS THAT THE SCIENCE OF IT IS THE 
SCIENCE OF SEVERAL YEARS AGO THERE 
HAVE BEEN STRIKE NEW DEVELOPMENTS 
SINCE THE BILL WAS PRINTED THAT 
WILL RENDER THE ETHICAL DISCUSSIONS 
OBSOLETE THAT IS ESPECIALLY THE 
HYBRID EMBRYOS ONE BUT ALSO WITH 
THE SAVIOUR SIBLINGS DISCUSSION WE 
ARE HAVING SAVING MILLIONS OF 
LIVES IS A MASSIVE EXAGGERATION 
SHOULD THE TREATMENT BE AVAILABLE 
THE WHITTAKERS HAD TO GO ABROAD I I THOUGHT IT WAS DISGRACEFUL THAT THE 
WHITTAKERS HAD TO GO TO AMERICA TO 
GET THE LIFE SAVING TREATMENT THAT 
CHARLIE NEEDED WHEN WE COULD HAVE 
PROVIDED IT IN THE U. K. THIS IS NOT 
A NEW TECHNOLOGY IT IS I. V. F. IT HAS 
BEEN AROUND FOR THIRTY YEARS L. DON'T 
SENSE THAT THE FABRIC OF SOCIETY 
WILL DI SOLVE BECAUSE OF THIS PGD 
IS USED FOR COUPLES THAT HAVE 
CHILDREN WITH A PROBLEM TO HELP 
THAT THE OTHER CHILD IS NOT 
AFFECTED SO THIS IS A STEP FORWARD 
TO LOAD THE ODDS THAT THE NEXT 
CHILD BORN COULD BE A TISSUE MATCH 
FOR AN EARLIER SICK CHILD 
LOTS OF E. MAILS ANNE ANNE A BABY 
HAS RIGHTS TOO SAVIOUR SIBLINGS 
SHOULD BE USED WHEN THERE IS NO 
OTHER ALTERNATIVE 
WHAT WOULD 
HAPPEN IS THAT YOU LOOK AT THE 
FAMILY THE EXISTING CHILDREN AND 
EXISTING FAMILY MEMBERS AND LOOK 
FOR A MATCH THE NEXT LEVEL UP IS 
TO LOOK ON THE REGISTERS THERE ARE 
REGISTERS OF PEOPLE WILLING TO 
DONATE IT IS WHEN THOSE APPROACHES 
HAVE FAILED THAT YOU EVEN CONSIDER 
SAVIOUR SIBLINGS 
YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FREE 
FOR ALL WHAT COULD HAPPEN NEXT 
LET'S LOOK AT THE BILL THAT WILL BE 
DEBATED AND VOTED ON TOMORROW FOR 
THE FIRST TIME ALL OF THIS WILL 
COME INTO LAW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
TAKING MORE TISSUES NOT JUST 
UMBILICAL CORD STEM CELLS AND BONE 
MARROW BUT TISSUE INCLUDING PARTS 
OF ORGANS THAT IS TAKING US TO A 
NEW LEVEL MEDICALLY SECONDLY WE 
WILL USE THESE TECHNIQUES PERHAPS 
FOR A MUCH WIDER RANGE OF 
CONDITIONS WE ARE GOING TO MOVE 
BEYOND THE LIFE THREATENING TO 
THE SERIOUS WE SAW IN THE NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN 
ABORTION ACT HOW THE LANGUAGE OF 
SERIOUS GETS DIAL OUTED ALAN 
USED THE LANGUAGE OF ONE STEP WE 
COULD END UP A LONG WAY FROM WHERE 
WE ARE TODAY IN THE FUTURE 
WE KNOW 
YOU HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS THIS 
COMES FROM NORMA FROM HERTFORDSHIRE 
CHILDREN COULD BE CONCEIVED 
THROUGH LOVE NOT NEED AND WHAT 
HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS NO MATCH IS 
IT A STEP TOO FAR WHAT WOULD HAVE 
HAPPENED IF THERE WAS NO MATCH 
CHARLIE'S FUTURE AND THERE WAS NO 
MATCH AND WE DIDN'T DO WHAT WE DID 
WE COULD HAVE HAD CHILDREN IN THE 
NORMAL WAY YOU COULD NEVER GET A 
MATCH MAYBE BUT CHARLIE'S LIFE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN RULED BY INVASIVE 
MEDICAL PROCEDURES CHARLIE WOULD 
HAVE SURVIVED ONLY ON BLOOD AND 
DRUG CALLED DEFTRA WHICH IS 
CONNECTED UP TO A PUMP NOBODY 
KNOWS WHAT HIS LIFE EXPECTANCY 
WOULD HAVE BEEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
VERY OUR NORMAL WAS EVERY DAY 
HAVING TO GO HOME AND STICK 
NEEDLE IN THEIR SON WE HAVE 
EVERYBODY AELS'S NORMAL NOW 
WHAT ABOUT YOU 
THEY WANTED ME TO 
HAVE A TEST AT EIGHTEEN WEEKS IF JAMIE 
IS NOT A TISSUE MATCH WE WOULD 
HAVE STILL HAD JAMIE 
THANK YOU

BEEN INTERESTING HEARING FROM YOU

LONGER TEN CENTURIES THE LINE UP 
HAS CHANGED BUT THE MUSIC THEY MAKE 
CERTAINLY HASN'T 
IN THE HEART OF THE VIENNESE FOREST 
IS THE MONASTERY OF HEILIGENKREUZ 
THE RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES OF THE 
CISTERCIAN MONKS HAVE BEEN 
UNCHANGED FOR CENTURIES HOWEVER 
IT'S THESE ANCIENT RITES THAT COULD 
CAP PUT THE MONKS FROM SIMPLE 
PRAYERS TO POP STARDOM

OUR GREGORIAN CHANTS WHAT IS THE 
REASON YOU ARE VERY WELCOME HERE 
THE GREGORIAN CHANT IS VERY OLD 
YET THE MELODIES ARE ONE THOUSAND YEARS 
OLD IT'S VERY LIVING FORM IT'S 
A KIND OF PRAYER IT'S NOT JUST 
SINGING FOR SINGING IT'S SINGING 
FOR PRAISING GOD

SOUND PIOUS BUT IT'S REALLY THE 
MUSIC OF HEAVEN A MUSIC OF 
PARADISE PARADISE IT'S THESE HYPNOTIC PRAYERS THAT

FIRSTLY I WAS 
NOT SO SURE THAT WE WOULD AGREE AND 
WE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS AND 
SPEECHES INSIDE THE MONASTERY 
MONEY IS NOT IMPORTANT THING 
FOR THIS CONTRACT BUT WE DO IT TO 
MAKE PEOPLE PART OF THIS ATMOSPHERE 
OF OUR MONASTERY 
THAT IS THE HOPE WE CAN HELP 
PEOPLE IN SEARCHING IN LOOKING FOR 
GOD GOD HERE WE ARE ON THE HOT SPOT OF THE 
RECORDING BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE 
CHAPEL OF HEILIGENKREUZ HERE 
THEHOLY CROSS IS ADORED BY THE 
FAITHFUL THEY ARE JUST STARTING 
THE RECORDING 
THE MONKS MAY SOUND NOTE PERFECT 
CAN THEY SATISFY THE CRITICAL EAR 
OF PRODUCER ANNA BARRY 
COULD I ASK JUST TWO POINTS TO 
THINK ABOUT PERHAPS 
IT WASN'T UNANIMOUS THE INTOE 
NATION I THOUGHT IT SOUNDED WRONG 
BUT MAYBE MY EARS WERE TIRED 
THE MONKS ARE CLEARLY NOT USED TO 
THE POP IDOL TREATMENT

WANT THEM TO GET THE BEST OUT OF 
THEMSELVES ARE YOU READY I AM 
DEFINITELY

THEIR DAY IS NOT QUITE OVER 
I HOPE THAT THE MEDIUM WILL BE 
SUCCESSFUL TO BRING THE MESSAGE OF 
THE CHURCH TO MAKE PEOPLE PART OF 
THE BEAUTIFUL ASPECT OF THE CHURCH 
AND THE MESSAGE OF JESUS CHRIST 
I HOPE IF WE CAN SOMEHOW BOTTLE THE 
ATMOSPHERE OF THE EXPERIENCE WE'VE 
HAD OUT HERE AND THAT ATMOSPHERE 
SOMEHOW COMES ACROSS ON THE C. D. WE 
WILL HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY 
SPECIAL 
IF WE ARE ON THE TOP OF THE CHARTS
