OH YOU MEAN LIKE A SEASON YES 
LIKE AUTUMN OR WINTER 
OR SPRING OR SUMMER 
O. K. LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
I DON'T THINK IT CAN BE AUTUMN 
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO GOLDEN LEAVES FALLING TO THE GROUND 
I DON'T THINK IT'S WINTER 
BECAUSE IN WINTER ALL THE BRANCHES ON THE TREES ARE BARE 
I DON'T THINK IT'S SPRING 
BECAUSE IN SPRING THERE ARE LITTLE BUDS ON THE BRANCHES

AND IT'S NOT SPRING IT MUST BE 
SUMMER

COLOURS UP HIGH COLOURS DOWN LOW 
HAVE A LOOK WHERE YOU ARE NOW NAME THE COLOURS THAT YOU KNOW 
CAN YOU GUESS WHAT I'M PRETENDING TO DO 
CAN YOU 
I'M PRETENDING TO PAINT 
CAN YOU GUESS WHAT I'M PAINTING WITH 
IT'S LONG AND IT'S THIN AND YOU USE IT TO DIP IN YOUR PAINTS 
CAN YOU GUESS 
IT'S A PAINTBRUSH 
AND WHAT I'M PAINTING IS A BRUSH AS WELL 
I WONDER IF YOU CAN GUESS WHAT THAT IS 
IT'S GOT A LONG HANDLE THAT'S USUALLY WOODEN 
AND IT'S GOT THE BRUSH PART ALONG THE BOTTOM LIKE THAT 
AND YOU USE IT 
TO SWEEP UP ALL THE BITS OF RUBBISH 
SWISH SWOOSH SWISH CAN YOU GUESS 
IT'S A SWEEPING BRUSH 
OR A BROOM 
THERE ARE LOTS OF BRUSHES AROUND AREN'T THERE UM 
CAN YOU GUESS WHAT THIS BRUSH IS 
IT'S ABOUT THAT LONG 
AND YOU HOLD IT LIKE THAT AND YOU SQUIDGE TOOTHPASTE ON THE BOTTOM 
CAN YOU GUESS 
HA HA YOU USE IT FOR CLEANING YOUR TEETH 
WHY DON'T YOU PRETEND YOU'VE GOT A TOOTHBRUSH LIKE ME 
HOLD IT LIKE THAT AND SQUIRT SOME PRETEND TOOTHPASTE ON 
AND WE'LL GIVE OUR TEETH A CLEAN READY 
HAVE YOU CLEANED YOUR TEETH TOO GOOD YOUR TEETH ARE NICE AND CLEAN 
AND THERE ARE SOME MORE TEETH THROUGH ONE OF THE WINDOWS 
SHALL WE HAVE A LOOK 
HOW MANY WINDOWS 
ONE TWO THREE 
ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED 
BUT WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
IT'S 
THE 
SQUARE WINDOW 
THESE MONKEYS ARE CALLED MACAQUES 
AND IT'S THEIR FEEDING TIME 
WHEN MACAQUES SHOW THEIR TEETH IT LOOKS A BIT LIKE THEY'RE SMILING 
THEY HAVE TEETH VERY SIMILAR TO YOURS OR MINE 
THESE ANIMALS ARE CALLED BEAVERS 
AND THEY HAVE BIG STRONG TEETH 
BEAVERS USE THEIR TEETH TO CHOP DOWN SMALL TREES 
AND GNAW THROUGH BRANCHES 
THEY USE THE BRANCHES TO BUILD BIG DAMS 
BEAVERS ARE GREAT BUILDERS AND THEY'RE ALWAYS BUSY 
YOU MIGHT RECOGNISE THESE SHARP TEETH 
THEY BELONG TO A CROCODILE 
CROCODILES USE THEIR TEETH TO CATCH THEIR FOOD AND EAT IT UP 
BUT LOOK AT THIS EVEN THOUGH THIS MOTHER CROCODILE HAS SHARP TEETH 
SHE CAN PICK UP HER BABIES IN HER MOUTH 
SHE'S CARRYING ALL THE BABIES IN HER MOUTH DOWN TO THE RIVER FOR A SWIM 
THOSE TEETH AREN'T ALWAYS DANGEROUS 
NOW THE BABIES ARE SAFE IN THE RIVER 
AND LOOK AT THAT EVEN BABY CROCODILES HAVE SHARP LITTLE TEETH 
NOW THESE ANIMALS HAVE REALLY BIG TEETH 
CALLED TUSKS THESE ARE WALRUSES 
WALRUSES LIKE TO LIVE TOGETHER IN BIG GROUPS 
HAVING BIG TUSKS CAN BE VERY USEFUL TO GET A GOOD PLACE ON THE BEACH 
O. I. BUDGE OVER YOU 
HERE IS AN ANIMAL YOU MAY RECOGNISE THAT HAS EVEN LONGER TEETH 
ELEPHANT TUSKS ARE HUGE AND BIG MALE ELEPHANTS FIGHT WITH EACH OTHER 
USING THEIR TUSKS 
ELEPHANTS ARE SO BIG AND HEAVY 
AND THEIR TUSKS ARE SO LONG AND STRONG 
THAT THEY CAN EVEN USE THEM TO PUSH OVER TREES 
SO TEETH COME IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES 
FROM THE SMALL TEETH OF THE MACAQUES 
TO BEAVERS AND THEIR BIGGER CHOPPING TEETH 
TO THE BIGGEST TEETH OF ALL TUSKS 
BEVERLEY YES TAMBA TEETH ARE VERY IMPORTANT AREN'T THEY 
THEY ARE THEY MAKE EATING MUCH EASIER 
DO YOU HAVE TO CHEW ALL YOUR FOOD 
THERE ARE FOODS YOU CAN EAT WITHOUT BITING INTO IT LIKE PORRIDGE 
BUT YOU STILL NEED YOUR TEETH TO HELP YOU TO EAT IT MMM 
M. M. M. M. M. M. M. HA HA
