THE DEBATE OVER HOME BIRTHS HAS 
BEEN REOPENED BY RESEARCH PUBLISHED 
TODAY IT SUGGESTS THERE MAYBE A 
HIGHER RISK FOR BABIES WHEN WOMEN 
WHO PLAN TO HOME BIRTH ARE 
TRANSFERRED TO HOSPITAL 
THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF MIDWIVES SAYS 
THE EVIDENCE ISN'T CLEAR AND MORE 
RESEARCH IS NEEDED

THREE POINT FOUR FIVE THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS 
ALMOST BALL BABIES IN THE U. K. ARE 
BORN IN HOSPITAL CHILDBIRTH IS 
VERY SAFE BUT THERE IS NO HARD 
EVIDENCE ON WHETHER HOME OR 
HOSPITAL IS SAFER

RISKS FOR HOME BIRTHS EXPERTS SAY 
IT SUGGESTS HIGHER RISKS FOR BABIES 
WHOSE MOTHERS HAVE TO TRANSFER TO 
HOSPITAL HOSPITAL IF YOU CHOOSE A HOME BIRTH AND 
THINGS GO WELL IT IS A WONDERFUL 
OUTCOME FOR THE MOTHER AND THE BABY

THINGS WILL GO WRONG AND FOR THEM 
THE OUTCOME MAYBE WORSE THAN IF 
THEY HAD BEEN ON THE SPOT IN 
HOSPITAL WHEN THE COMPLICATION 
OCCURRED OCCURRED THIS WEEK ALL MATERNITY UNITS IN 
ENGLAND ARE SIGNING UP TO A NEW

I MIGHT HAVE IT THE SO SO GOOD LUCK 
TO HIM 
THE MEL MARSHALL IT HAPPENED TO US 
ALL AT SOME POINT YOU MISSED AN 
IMPORTANT APPOINTMENT BECAUSE 
SHE WAS THERE 
THERE IS A WAITING 
ROOM YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO TURN UP 
IN THE WAITING ROOM AND STAND IN 
THERE AND PEOPLE KNOW LOUISE 
MINCHIN IS THERE TICK HER OFF BUT 
SHE WAS STANDING OUTSIDE THE ROOM 
I HAVE GOT TO SAY RULES IS RULES 
YES YES EVEN FOR DAYDREAMERS 
IT IS SIX HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT 
IT IS SIX HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT THE PROBLEMS OF DEALING WITH AUTISM 
ARE BEING HIGHLIGHTED TODAY ONE 
CHARITY IS CLAIMING MANY CHILDREN 
WITH THE CONDITION ARE NOT BEING 
EDUCATED ENOUGH NUALA GARDNER WHO 
HAS TWO AUTISTIC CHILDREN IS HERE 
WITH DALE 
NUALA HAS WRITTEN ABOUT HER 
EXPERIENCES EXPERIENCES GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH 
GOOD MORNING 
IT IS A SELF HELP THING FOR YOU 
YOU FOUND YOUR WAY WITH DALE OF HOW 
TO GET THROUGH IT IT IT 
FORTUNATELY I WAS TRAINED 
MIDWIFE I THINK THAT WAS MY 
LIFELINE I COULD UNDERSTAND THE 
PROBLEMS WITH COMMUNICATION HAD 
KNOWLEDGE OF BABY DEVELOPMENT BUT 
IN SAYING THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
HELPFUL TO GET A DIAGNOSIS 
EDUCATIONALLY IT IS A BATTLE TO 
GET A DIAGNOSIS WE HAD TO WAIT 
FOUR YEARS BECAUSE I KNEW I DIDN'T 
KNOW IT WAS AWE TIM BUT THE ALARM 
BELLS RANG AS SOON AS DALE WAS BORN 
IT TOOK FOUR YEARS FOR A DIAGNOSIS 
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BATTLE TO GET 
THE APPROPRIATE EDUCATION 
THE APPROPRIATE THING FOR YOU WAS 
THE DOG THAT FEATURES ON THE FRONT 
OF YOUR MUM'S BOOK HENRY TELL US 
ABOUT HIM DALE 
I SUPPOSE IT IS 
ABOUT HOW HE HELPED DEVELOP A 
PROCESS THAT GOT ME TO WHERE I AM 
TODAY TODAY HOW DID HE HELP YOU WHY WAS IT 
DOG THAT MANAGED TO HELP YOU WHAT 
WAS THE DIFFERENCE 
MOST PEOPLE 
WITH AUTISM FINDS THE HUMAN FACE 
SCARY AS WITH THIS DOG THERE WAS 
NO SCARINESS ON HIS FACE HIS EYES 
WERE CONTENT AND IT HAD A TRUSTING 
FACE IT WAS EASY TO TALK TO MY 
MUM AND DAD USE ADD VOICE FOR HENRY 
A VOICE WHAT VOICE A TALKING DOG 
THE BOOK IS VERY GRAPHIC A 
HARROWING DETAILED ACCOUNT OF 
AUTISM FROM BIRTH SIGNS AND 
SYMPTOMS FROM WHERE HE IS TO NOW L. 
EXPLAIN A LOT ABOUT AUTISM WHAT I 
WAS LEARNING AS I WROTE THE BOOK 
WAS EIGHTY PER CENT OF COMMUNICATION AS WE KNOW 
IT IS NON VERBAL AND IT IS THE NON 
VERBAL BARRIER THAT IS INHIBITING 
PEOPLE WITH AUTISM TO MAKE THAT 
FIRST WORD WITH THE DOG WE USED 
THE DOG AS A FURY FACILITY BY 
ACCIDENT WE WERE ALL WORKING 
TOGETHER BUT THE PROGRESS WAS SLOW 
AS IT IS WITH AUTISM IN COMES A 
DOG UNKNOWN TO US I KNEW KNEW HAD 
AN AFFINITY FOR THE DALLING L. 
DIDN'T DOG L. DIDN'T KNOW THIS 
DOG MY HUSBAND GAVE THIS DOG A 
VOICE WHEN THE DOG SPOKE DALE 
WOULD DO ANYTHING THE DOG ASKED 
ANYTHING WE FOUND QUICKLY WE COULD 
USE THE DOG FOR ALL THE EDUCATIONAL 
APPROACH THAT YOU WOULD WITH A 
CHILD WITH AUTISM AND THE DOG WOULD 
BE THE TEACHER 
DALE YOU ARE NOW EIGHTEEN IS THAT RIGHT 
IS IT EASIER FOR YOU NOW THAT YOU 
YOU UNDERSTAND IS IT EASIER TO DEAL 
WITH PEOPLE BECAUSE OF HENRY YES YES HOW IS IT 
I FIND IT EASIER TO TALK 
TO PEOPLE NOW AND I KNOW A LOT OF 
APPROPRIATE COMMUNICATIONS NEEDED 
TELL PEOPLE 
YOU LEFT SCHOOL NOW 
I HAVE 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW 
I AM HALF 
WAY THROUGH MY COLLEGE 
AND THAT'S GOING WELL YES YES THE ORIGINAL HENRY PASSED ON 
YES YES BUT THERE IS ANOTHER HENRY BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THE FILM OF THE BOOK WHICH MAKES 
IT CONFUSING WE HAVE A TOMORROW 
MASS AND A THOMAS AND A HENRY NOW 
THOMAS AND HENRY AFTER THOMAS THE 
TANK ENGINE 
THERE WAS A REASON WHY THE DOG WAS 
CALLED HENRY AFTER THE NUMBER THREE 
ENGINE ENGINE THAT'S THE REASON WHY I HAVE 
SECOND HENRY AS WELL 
VERY GOOD

IS YOUR MEMORY WHEN YOU LOOK AT 
SOMETHING HOW MUCH CAN YOU 
REMEMBER 
NOT MUCH 
THIS MAN IS REMEMBER REMARKABLE HIS NAME IS STEPHEN HE 
KNEW OVER THE THAMES IN A 
HELICOPTER IN LONDON AND THEN DREW 
THIS FROM MEMORY LATER QUITE 
REMARKABLE 
INCREDIBLE LEVEL OF REMARKABLE DETAIL

WEDDING OUTFITTERS DESIGN WEDDING 
DRESSES DRESSES SEVEN HOURS OF SLEEP IS PERFECT FOR 
STAYING SLIM NO MORE NO LESS WE WE ARE NOT DOING WELL SIX HOURS 
MAYBE 
THOSE ARE THE PAPERS NOW MAYBE LET'S TALK ABOUT SEASONAL WORKERS 
LET'S TALK SUMMER HOLIDAYS AS WE 
KNOW EASTER IS WELL BEHIND US WHAT 
HAPPENS NOW WE HAVE GOT HOTELS AND 
TOURIST SITES ACROSS THE U. K. GEARING 
UP FOR THE SUMMER HOLIDAY THE 
ONSLAUGHT FOR THE SUMMER HOLIDAY 
WHAT NORMALLY HAPPENS IS THEY START 
RECRUITING THOUSANDS OF EXTRA 
WORKERS TO LEND A HELPING HAND 
ACCORDING TO THE BRITISH 
HOSPITALALTY ASSOCIATION ESTIMATES 
THAT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OF THOSE WORK ERS ARE 
FROM ABROAD THEY ARE EASTERN 
EUROPE PEEN MEMBERS OF THE E. U. 
RACHEL HAS BEEN TO THE ISLES OF 
SCILLY OFF THE COAST OF CORNWALL 
TO WELCOME SOME OF THESE WORKERS 
WHERE THEY ARE JUST ARRIVING 
SUSANNAH IS FROM SLOVAKIA SHE IS 
ONE OF THE STAFF TAKEN ON IN THIS 
HOTEL IN THE ISLES OF SCILLY SHE 
IS THE HEAD OF HOUSE KEEPING IT IS 
HER THIRD SEASON IN SAINT MARTINS 
WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE I HAD 
PROBLEM TO FIND JOB IN SLOVAKIA 
HERE THERE ARE PLENTY OF JOBS SO I 
JUST I AM JUST WORKING HERE AND I 
ALSO LIKE ENGLISH L. LIKE THE 
ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND THE PEOPLE 
IT'S DIFFERENT CULTURE 
WHEN THE GENERAL MANAGER STARTED 
RUNNING THIS HOTEL FOURTEEN YEARS AGO 
ALMOST ALL OF HIS STAFF WERE FROM 
THE U. K. TODAY FORTY PER CENT ARE FROM EASTERN 
EUROPE 
THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR EUROPE STAFF FOR THE KITCHEN ARE U. K. THEY 
ARE U. K. TRAINED BUT IF WE ARE 
TALKING ALSO FOR RECEPTION BUT 
IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE WAITING 
STAFF AND HOUSE KEEPING STAFF THEN 
THEY ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO SOURCE 
ALONG SIDE THE STAFF AT SAINT MARTINS 
MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED SEASONAL WORKERS COME 
TO THE ISLANDS EVERY YEAR AT LEAST 
HALF OF THESE WORKERS COME FROM 
OUTSIDE THE U. K. AND SAY THEIR 
ECONOMY DEPENDS ON THEM WITHOUT WITHOUT SEASONAL WORKERS THE ECONOMY MIGHT 
BE IN DANGER OF COLLAPSING THE 
MAIN REASON IS TOURISM IS OUR MAIN 
INCOME EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF OUR G. D. P. IS TOURISM 
WITHOUT SEASONAL WORKERS IT WOULD 
COLLAPSE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE 
ENOUGH LOCAL LABOUR TO FILL ALL THE 
JOBS WHICH NEED TO BE DONE IT IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A LONG WAY TO COME 
FOR A SUMMER JOB BUT FOR THOSE 
SEASONAL WORKERS WHO TAKE UP THE 
CHALLENGE IT IS A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE 
AND FOR THE ISLAND'S ECONOMY THOSE 
SEASONAL WORKER ARE A NECESSITY 
ALSO YOU CAN GET MORE ON THAT STORY

END OF THE PROGRAMME 
MILLIONS OF CHILDREN ARE PUTTING 
THEMSELVES AT RISK BY POSTING 
PERSONAL DETAILS ON SOCIAL 
NETWORKING SITES 
A SURVEY BY THE WATCHDOG OFCOM 
FOUND QUARTER OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE 
IGNORING AGE RESTRICTIONS LATER 
THIS WEEK NEW GUIDELINES ARE BEING 
ISSUED TO IMPROVE SAFETY ONLINE 
POPULAR NETWORKING SITES WILL HAVE 
TO DISPLAY A NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE EMERGENCY NUMBER 
FOR CHILDREN TO CALL IF THEY FEAR 
THEY ARE AT RISK OF ABUSE 
OVER FIFTH OF ADULT INTERNET 
USERS HAVE PROFILE ON A SOCIAL 
NETWORKING SITE WITH FACE BOOK AND 
MY SPACE AND BE BOA LEADING THE 
BEBO LEADING THE WAY 
BUT CHILDREN HAVE CAUGHT THE BUG A 
NEW REPORT FROM THE COMMUNICATIONS 
REGULATOR OFCOM SHOWS THAT HALF 
OF ALL CHILDREN WHO USE THE 
INTERNET IN THE U. K. HAVE A 
NETWORKING PROFILE IT ALSO SHOWS 
THAT MILLIONS OF CHILDREN LEAVE THE 
PROFILES OPEN SO ANYONE CAN ACCESS 
THEM AND THEIR PARENTS KNOW LITTLE 
OR NOTHING OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING 
AT LONDON'S SCIENCE MUSEUM THAT 
SEEMED TO BE THE CASE WITH THE 
PARENTS WE SPOKE TO 
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE SET HIS PRIVACY 
SETTINGS I LEFT IT UP TO HIM 
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SETTINGS ARE ON 
OR NOT WITH THAT SETTING FOR BEBO 
I REALLY HAVEN'T CLUE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT I DO KNOW HE SPENDS LOT OF TIME 
TALKING TO HIS FRIENDS ON IT THOUGH 
THE GOVERNMENT IS SO CONCERNED THAT 
LATER THIS WEEK IT IS PUBLISHING 
PROPOSALS TO MAKE NETWORKING 
WEBSITES ADVERTISE THE NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
EMERGENCY NUMBER TO ENCOURAGE 
CHILDREN TO CALL THE POLICE IF THEY 
THINK THEY ARE BEING TARGETED BY 
POTENTIAL ABUSERS THERE WOULD BE A 
SAFETY GUIDE FOR PARENTS TOO 
THE HOPE IS THAT BY HELPING PARENTS 
UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE 
DOING ONLINE IT WILL MAKE IT 
EASIER FOR THEM TO MINIMISE THE 
RISKS 
FOUR DAYS AFTER POLLING THERE IS 
CONFUSION SURROUNDING THE RESULTS 
OF ELECTIONS IN ZIMBABWE AND THE 
COUNTRY'S STATE RUN HERALD 
NEWSPAPER QUOTES ANALYSTS BY SAYING 
NONE OF THE CANDIDATES IN THE IN 
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION APPEAR TO 
HAVE WON A MAJORITY AND A RUN OFF 
MAYBE NECESSARY WE CAN SPEAK TO 
GRANT FERRETT WHO IS IN 
JOHANNESBURG JOHANNESBURG WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE NEWS THAT 
SUGGESTION THAT THERE MAYBE A RUN 
OFF IT IS ONLY IN ONE NEWSPAPER 
ISN'T IT 
THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLS 
THE NEWSPAPERS IN ZIMBABWE AS WELL 
AS THE T. V. AND THE RADIO AND WHEN 
THE HERALD TALKS ABOUT THINGS OF 
PARTY MATTERS ZANU P. F. IT CAN BE 
RELIED UPON AS AUTHORITATIVE I 
THINK IF THE HERALD IS SAYING AS 
IT IS THERE NEEDS TO BE A RE RUN 
IN THE PRESIDENTIAL BALLOT THAT'S 
WHAT THE AUTHORITIES IN ZIMBABWE 
WANT TO HAPPEN 
NOW WHETHER OR NOT ROBERT MUGABE 
WILL GO FOR THE IDEA OF A SECOND 
ROUND I THINK HE WOULD SAY NO WAY 
I'M NOT HAVING A SECOND ROUND 
THANK YOU AND WHETHER OR NOT THE 
OPPOSITION THE MOVEMENT FOR 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE WILL ACCEPT A 
SECOND ROUND IS A MUTE POINT 
BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION THINKS IT 
WON THE ELECTIONS IN THE FIRST 
ROUND AND THERE IS NO NEED FOR A 
SECOND RUN 
IF THERE WERE TO BE A RUN OFF IT 
WOULD BE MUGABE AGAINST MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI 
YES THE RULES ARE THE TSVANGIRAI WINNING CANDIDATE HAS TO GET FIFTY PER CENT 
PLUS ONE VOTE IN ORDER TO AVOID A 
RUN OFF IF NONE DO THAT THE TWO 
LEADING CONTENDERS GO THROUGH AND 
IF THE THE RESULTS OF THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION FOLLOW THE 
PATTERN OF THE PARLIAMENTARY 
RESULTS WE HAVE SO FAR AND WE DON'T 
HAVE THE FINAL PARLIAMENTARY 
RESULTS EVEN THOUGH VOTING WAS ON 
SATURDAY THERE IS NO CLEAR WINNER 
SO THERE WOULD BE A SECOND ROUND 
IF THE AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING IT IN 
ZIMBABWE THROUGH THE HERALD IT IS 
LOOKING LIKELY 
GRANT FERRETT IN JOHANNESBURG

YOU CAN KEEP UP TO DATE WITH THE 
NEWS WHEN YOU ARE OUT AND ABOUT ON

SUCCESS BUT WE SHOULD STRESS A 
COUPLE OF THINGS THIS DOES NOT 
IMPACT PEOPLE ALREADY HOLDING A

RESEARCH IS INCOMPLETE BUT WHAT DO 
YOU THINK ABOUT IT JOANNA YOU HAD 
TWO AND TWO SO TO SPEAK 
HIGH TWO 
BABIES IN HOSPITAL ONE WAS A SIS 
CAESARIAN AND THE SECOND WAS IN 
HOSPITAL AND TWO AT HOME 
WHICH DID YOU PREFER 
I PREFERRED 
THE HOME BIRTHS IT IS A DIFFERENT 
EXPERIENCE YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN 
TERRITORY AND THAT MAKES A BIG 
DIFFERENCE TO HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT 
THE ISSUE ISN'T WHETHER HOME BIRTHS 
ARE GOOD OR BAD BUT WHAT HAPPENS 
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG 
WELL WHEN 
SOMETHING GOES WRONG IN PREGNANCY 
HAVING A BABY IT IS MORE COMMON 
THAT SOMETHING GOES WRONG DURING 
THE PREGNANCY THAN DURING THE BIRTH 
THAT'S WHY ANTENATAL CHECKS ARE 
IMPORTANT WOMEN WHO HAVE ANTENATAL 
CHECKS AND WHO GO INTO LABOUR WITH 
A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH USUALLY TEN 
TO HAVE A GOOD EXPERIENCE OF BIRTH 
WHAT IS THE EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE 
BECAUSE IT IS CONCERNING WHEN YOU 
HEAR THE HEADLINE THAT YOU ARE MORE 
AT RISK IF YOU PLANNED A HOME BIRTH 
AND YOU GET MOVED TO HOSPITAL 
ISN'T IT 
THAT'S RIGHT L. THINK THE 
RISK IS LOW 
WHETHER YOU HAVE YOUR BABY AT 
HOSPITAL OR IN YOUR HOME BUT IT IS 
ONLY FAIR THAT WOMEN KNOW THE FACTS 
WHICH ARE YES IT IS SAFE BUT IF 
YOU PLAN TO HAVE YOUR BABY AT HOME 
THERE A ONE IN THREE CHANCE THAT 
YOU MAY END UP BEING TRANSFERRED 
INTO HOSPITAL DURING THE LABOUR AND 
IT THAT'S A RISKY TIME 
ONE IN THREE IS HIGH 
IT IS IT IS 
AND WE CAN WORK TO IMPROVE THAT 
BUT WOMEN NEED TO BE AWARE OF THAT 
PRESUMABLY SOME OF THE EMERGENCIES 
THEY ARE BY THEIR NATURE YOU ARE 
NOT GOING TO KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO 
HAPPEN ARE THEY IT DOES BECOME 
MORE DANGEROUS 
THAT'S RIGHT WHEN 
THINGS GO WRONG DURING LABOUR WHICH 
THEY ARE UNUSUAL BUT WHEN THEY 
HAPPEN THEY CAN BE SERIOUS AND HELP 
CAN BE NEEDED QUICKLY A LOT OF 
WOMEN TRANSFERRED IN DURING LABOUR 
IT CAN BE MORE MORE PAIN RELIEF 
IF YOU GO INTO LABOUR AND YOU HAVE 
HAD A STRAIGHTFORWARD PREGNANCY IT 
IS SAFER TO GIVE BIRTH AT HOME THAN 
IN HOSPITAL THE REASON IS THAT 
THERE ARE LOTS OF INTERVENTIONS 
THAT CAN HAPPEN IN HOSPITAL SO YOU 
ARE AT RISK YOU COULD CALL IT A 
RISK OF ONE INTERVENTION LEADING TO 
ANOTHER INTERVENTION IF YOU HAVE 
PAINKILLERS EARLY ON DURING YOUR 
PREGNANCY THAT WILL INCREASE THE 
CHANCE OF CAESAREAN SECTION 
WHEN PEOPLE ARE MAKING DECISIONS 
ABOUT THIS WHAT SHOULD THEY BE 
CONSIDERING 
FIRST OF ALL IT IS CONSIDERING MOST APPROPRIATE FOR WOMEN WHO ARE 
HEALTHY AND WHOSE BABY IS HEALTHY 
THE SECOND THING THAT WOMEN MUST 
HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO 
MAKE THE DECISION AND WHEN THEY DO 
THAT THERE MUST BE THE RESOURCES IN 
PLACE THERE MUST BE ENOUGH 
RESOURCES ENOUGH MIDWIVES A GOOD 
AM AMBULANCE SERVICE AND A GOOD 
BACK UP IN THE HOSPITAL 
I SUPPOSE IN ONE SENSE YOU HAVE GOT 
TO CHECK OUT THAT YOU HAVE GOT THE 
FACILITIES IN LINE YES YES YOU HAVE TO TALK TO THE MIDWIVES 
THE REALLY TRAGIC THING ABOUT THIS 
SITUATION IT IS DIFFICULT FOR 
INDIVIDUAL WOMEN WHO ARE REGULAR 
NANT AND WHO PREGNANT AND WHO GET 
INTO THE SYSTEM AND WANT A HOME 
DELIVERY THE GOVERNMENT IS BEHIND 
THE IDEA OF WOMEN BEING ABLE TO 
CHOOSE A HOME BIRTH BUT HAS NOT 
PUT THE RESOURCES AND THE SERVICES 
IN PLACE THAT ENABLE WOMEN TO BE 
CERTAIN THAT THEY CAN HAVE ONE 
WE CAN TALK MORE ABOUT THIS

LIFE INTO IT HE WILL BE WITH US 
LATER IN THE PROGRAMME WE HAVE 
LOST THE ART OF SHINING OUR SHOES

FOR QUICK FIX SPRAYS NOT IN THE 
ARMY LANCE CORPORAL OF THE HORSE 
ALEX CAWLEY FROM THE BLUES AND 
ROYALS HORSE CAVALRY REGIMENT IS 
WITH US NOW THAT IS A LOT OF BOOT 
THAT IS ALL LEATHER AND THAT IS ALL 
THAT ALL HAS TO BE POLISHED THAT THAT IS RIGHT 
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE 
HOURS YOU 
START WITH JUST A NORMAL LEATHER 
BOOT LOOKING LIKE A NORMAL PAIR OF 
SHOES 
IT WOULD HAVE STARTED OFF SHOES LIKE ONE OF BILL'S 
YES THAT KIND 
OF LEATHER THEN BURN BEES WAX INTO 
IT SMOOTH IT FIFTY SIX AND POLISH AND 
WATER 
I THOUGHT THAT IS PATENT WATER LEATHER I THOUGHT IT WAS EASY I I THINK IT SHOULD BE IT WOULD BE 
EASIER 
WE DON'T TAKE PRIDE IN OUR EASIER SHOES SO MUCH WHEN WE ARE NOT IN 
THE ARMED FORCES 
I DON'T KNOW IT 
IS PERSONAL PRIDE IT IS A LOT 
EASIER TO TAKE THE QUICK OPTION AND 
GET AWAY WITH IT 
WHEN YOU ARE NOT 
DRESSED UP IN THAT DO YOU BOTHER 
TO SHINE YOUR SHEES WITH BOTHER 
SHINING YOUR SHOES 
I WOULD NOT 
WEAR ALL MY SHOES LIKE THIS THEY 
WOULD LOOK A BIT BIZARRE TO BE 
HONEST ONCE YOU HAVE TO TAKE TIME 
AND PRESENT YOURSELF IT IS JUST 
PART OF PERSONAL PRIDE 
YOU TALK 
ABOUT BEES WAX 
THAT IS WHAT MAKES 
THE HARD BOOT AS YOU CAN SEE IT IS 
QUITE RID GID THAT IS WHAT MAKES 
IT EASIER TO POLISH 
BOBBING OR 
BULLING 
DEPENDING WHAT PART OF THE BULLING ARMY YOU ARE IN IT IS NORMALLY 
BULLING BUT WE CALL IT BOBBING 
EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN NAMES WHY WHY BEE'S WAX ON HARDER LEATHER BEE'S BEE'S WAX HARDENS THE LEATHER UP THEN 
YOU CAN WORK THE POLISH INTO IT 
NOW PEOPLE THESE DAYS SEEM TO BE 
USING WIPES OR CREAM WOULD YOU DO 
THAT YOUR REAL LIFE OUTSIDE OF THE 
ARMY OR NOT 
YEAH I DON'T SEE WHY 
NOT IT CANNOT BE THAT BAD 
HERE IS 
YOUR CHALLENGE L. HAVE TWO SHOES 
BOTH WORN BY ME L. WILL KEEP ONE 
WOULD YOU MIND TAKING THAT ONE AND 
DOING YOUR BOBBING OFF WE WOULD 
LIKE IT TO LOOK LIKE THAT BUT 
THAT IS DIFFICULT YOU WOULD USE 
REGULAR POLISH NORMAL 
THESE ARE NORMAL THE BRUSHES THERE THEY ARE BIG 
AREN'T THEY 
IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE 
SIZE OF THE BOOT A SMALL BRUSH 
WOULD TAKE QUITE SOME TIME ONE ONE HARD ONE SOFTISH HOW LONG WOULD 
IT TAKE YOU TO DO A SHOE LIKE THAT 
NORMALLY WE HAVE TO DO OUR WORK 
SHOES THEY HAVE BEE'S WAX IN AS 
WELL IT SHOULD ONLY TAKE HALF AN 
HOUR 
HALF AN HOUR PER SHOE 
FOR A HOUR PAIR PAIR IT IS A LONG TIME IT IS FIFTEEN MINUTES

COMPUTER AND YOU HAVE TO FILL IN A 
FEW NUMBERS AND THINGS BUT IT

SAYING TO YOURSELF RIGHT THIS 
EVENING I'M GOING TO SPEND TWO 
HOURS MAKING MONEY FOR MYSELF 
WHEN YOU SAVE MONEY IT IS THE SAME 
AS MAKING MONEY EXCEPT YOU DON'T 
PAY TAX IF YOU THINK OF IT IN THAT 
WAY AND WITH YOUR GAS OR 
ELECTRICITY SAY YOU SAVE TEN A 
MONTH AND YOU THINK THINK THINK TEN 
A MONTH BUT MULTIPLY THAT BY TWELVE

APRIL ALSO AHEAD IS ZIMBABWE 
HEADING FOR AN ELECTIONRY RUN THE 
STATE RUN NEWSPAPER SAYS NO SIDE AS 
WON AN OVERALL MAJORITY AND FIRST 
DIRECT PULLS ALL MORTGAGES FOR NEW 
CUSTOMERINGS THE BANK SAYS IT HAS 
BEEN SWAMPED BY BOAR WERS LOOKING 
FOR A GOOD DEAL 
HERE WE ARE NOW 
ENTERTAIN US 
FIND OUT WHAT THE TOP GUITAR RIFFS 
OF ALL TIME ARE AND LET US KNOW IF 
YOU AGREE WITH THEM

OPEN ROAD THERE IS A BURST OF STAR 
FIRE THE SKY IS LIKE OIL ON WATER 
THE DOCTOR IS BACK WE WILL SPEAK 
TO THE WRITER OF DOCTOR WHO RUSELL T. 
DAVIES ABOUT HIS NEW SEVERRYS AND 
WE SET THIS YOUNG MAN A CHALLENGE 
TO PUT THE SHINE BACK IN BILL'S 
SHOE THERE HE S. HE IS PUT BIT OF 
SPIT AND POLISH ONLY FIFTEEN MINUTES 
SHOE IN CASE YOU WITH WONDERING 
WHY HE IS DOING THAT A NEW SURVEY 
SAYS THE ART OF SHINING SHOES IS 
DYING OUT MILLIONS OF CHILDREN ARE 
PUTTING THESTS AT RISK BY POSTING 
PERSONAL DETAILS ON SOCIAL 
NETWORKING SITE A SUR FAI FOUND 
QUARTER OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE 
IGNORING AGE RESTRICTIONS NEW 
GUIDELINES ARE BEING ISSUED TO 
IMPROVE SAFETY ONLINE NETWORKING 
SITE ALSO HAVE TO DISPLAY A NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
EMERGENCY NUMBER FOR CHILDREN TO 
CALL IF THEY FEAR THEY ARE AT RISK 
OF ABUSE IT IS THE CRAZE WHICH HAS 
SWEPT BRITAIN SOCIAL NETWORKING IS 
USED BY A FIFTH OF ALL ADULT 
INTERNET USERS BUT IT'S THE WAY 
CHILDREN USE THE LIKES OF FACEBOOK 
AND MIE SPACE WHICH IS CAUSING 
CONCERN THE HOME OFFICE WILL 
PUBLISH A CODE FOR SOCIAL NETWORKS 
URGING THEM TO PUT EMERGENCY 
NUMBERS ON THEIR SITES FOR CHILDREN 
TO CALL IF THEY FEEL IN DANGER AND 
TODAY RESEARCH FROM OFCOM SHOWS 
THAT CHILDREN ARE MORE SAVVY ABOUT 
SOCIALISING ON LINE THAN THEIR 
PARENTS BUT OFTEN GIVE TOO MUCH 
AWAY TODAY'S RESEARCH SHOWS THAT 
HALF OF ALL THE CHILDREN IN BRITAIN 
WHO HAD INTERNET ACCESS HAVE 
PROFILE ON SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE 
THE MAJORITY ON BEBO BUT IT SHOWS 
THAT MILLIONS OF THEM ARE DOING 
NOTHING TO KEEP THOSE PROFILES 
PRIVATE AND THEIR PARENTS OFTEN 
UNDERSTAND LITTLE OF THIS WORLD 
AMONG VISITORS TO LONDON'S SCIENCE 
MUSEUM WE FOUND THAT CHILDREN WERE 
PRETTY CLUED UP ABOUT KEEPING THEIR 
SOCIAL NETWORKING PROFILES PRIVATE 
THEIR PARENTS APPEAR TO KNOW LITTLE 
ABOUT THE SUBJECT 
I DON'T KNOW HOW 
HE SET HIS PRIVACY SETTINGS L. LEFT 
IT UP TO HIM 
I HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT 
WHAT SETTINGS ARE ON OR NOT WITH 
THAT SETTING FOR BEBO REALLY REALLY HAVEN'T A CLUE L. DON'T KNOW 
ANYTHING ABOUT IT L. DO KNOW HE 
SPENDS A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO HIS 
FRIENDS ON IT 
LAST BEAK'S REVIEW 
ON CHILDREN AND TECHNOLOGY CALLED 
FOR MORE GUIDANCE FOR PARENTS AND 
LATER WEEK THE GOVERNMENT'S NEW 
INTERNET SAFETY CODE WILL REINFORCE 
THAT MESSAGE 
FIRST DIRECT HAS CAN DRAWN ALL 
MORTGAGES TO NEW CUSTOMERS AFTER 
BEING SWAMPED BY NEW APPLICATION 
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT 
THIS IS 
REFLECTING THE TOUGH TIMES ON THE 
MORTGAGE MARKET OUT THERE FIRST FIRST DIRECT DID IT IS THE U. K.'S BIGGEST 
LENDER AND THE BOTTOM LINE FIRST 
DIRECT HAS BEEN SWAMPED BY 
BORROWERS LOOK FOR FOR A GOOD 
MORTGAGE A GOOD DEAL ON THEIR 
MORTGAGES FIRST DIRECT SAYS IT 
CAN'T COPE REALLY WITH THE DEMANDS 
SO WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS 
TEMPORARILY FROZEN ALL MORTGAGES 
FOR NEW CUSTOMERS WHY THEY TRY TO 
CLEAR THE BACKLOG LOOK WHO ARE WE 
KIDDING THE STORY BEHIND THIS TORY 
IS THE SAME OLD STORY AND IT IS 
THAT CREDIT CRISIS MONEY IN THE 
BANKING SYSTEM AT THE MOMENT IS 
VERY TIGHT WHAT THEY HAVE GOT THEY 
ARE HANGING ON TO THEY ARE BEING 
MORE SELECTIVE IN WHO THEY LEND TO 
AND IT IS GETTING MORE EXPENSIVE TO 
BORROW MONEY WE HAVE SEEN A COUPLE 
OF THE OTHER BIG LENDERS INCREASE 
THEIR VARIABLE RATES AND SO WHAT 
THIS HAS DONE IS LEFT PEOPLE 
LOOKING FOR A NEW MORTGAGE 
SCRAMBLING ROUND TO TRY AND FIND 
THE BEST DEAL AND FIRST DIRECT DID 
HAVE A PRETTY GOOD DEAL INDEED 
THEY HAD A TWO YEAR FIXED RATE AT 
FOUR POINT NINE FIVE PER CENT IN SOME WAYS A VICTIM OF 
THEIR OWN SUCCESS WE SHOULD STRESS 
THIS DOES NOT IMPACT ANYBODY WHO 
CURRENTLY HAS A MORTGAGE WITH FIRST 
DIRECT IT DOESN'T IMPACT ON 
ANYBODY WHO HAS APPLYED WITH A 
MORTGAGE WITH FIRST DIRECT AND IT 
DOESN'T MEAN THAT FIRST DIRECT IS 
IN ANY WAY IN ANY FINANCIAL 
DIFFICULTIES IT IS JUST REFLECTING 
THE TOUGH TIMES OUT THERE ON THE 
MORTGAGE MARKETS THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH THE DEBATE BRITISH AIRWAYS 
HAS REVEALED IT IS SENDING 
THOUSANDS OF SUITCASES TO ITALY IN 
AED BY TO CLEAR A BACKLOG AT 
TERMINAL FIVE A SPOKESMAN SAID THE 
LUGGAGE WAS BEING SENT TO A FIRM IN 
MILAN WHERE IT WOULD BE SORTED AND 
DRIVEN OR FLOWN TO OWNERS THE 
NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS SWITCHING GIN 
SUPPLIERS HIT A FIVE YEAR HIGH 
ACCORD TO OFGEM MORE THAN FIVE 
MILLION PEOPLE CHANGED A MOVE 
WHICH SAVES ON AVERAGE NINETY TWO A YEAR 
THE DETAIT ON HOTH BIRTHS HAS BEEN 
RE OPENED TODAY IT SUGGESTS THERE 
MAYBE A HIGHER RISK WHEN WOMEN ARE 
TRANSFERRED TO HOSPITAL THE ROYAL 
COLLEGE OF MIDWIVES SAYS THE 
EVIDENCE ISN'T CLEAR AND MORE 
RESEARCH IS NEEDED SIX WEEK OLD 
REBECCA WAS BORN AT HOME HER MUM 
JENNY SAYS IT WAS A SPECIAL 
EXPERIENCE SHE WAS A LOW RISK 
MOTHER AND REBECCA'S ARRIVAL WAS 
STRAIGHTFORWARD 
IT HAPPENED VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD QUICKLY FROM THE FIRST INDICATION 
OF LABOUR AT LUNCHTIME WHEN REBECCA 
WAS BORN AT THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON 
THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS AT ALL 
ALMOST ALL BABIES ARE BORN IN 
HOSPITAL IN THE U. K. OVERALL 
CHILDBIRTH IS VERY SAFE BUT THERE 
IS NO HARD EVIDENCE ON WHETHER HOME 
OR HOSPITAL IS SAFER TODAY'S 
RESEARCH ESTIMATES THE RISKS FOR 
HOME BIRTHS EXPERTS SAY IT 
SUGGESTS HIGHER RISINGS FOR BABY 
WHOSE MOTHERS HAVE TO TRANSFER TO 
HOSPITAL 
IF YOU CHOOSE A HOME HOSPITAL BIRTH AND THINGS GO WELL IT IS 
WONDERFUL BUT THERE IS A SMALL 
GROUP WHERE THING ALSO GO WRONG AND 
FOR THEM SADLY THE OUTCOME MAYBE 
WORSE THAN IF THEY HAD BEEN ON THE 
SPOT IN HOSPITAL WHEN THE 
COMPLICATION OCCURRED 
THIS WEEK 
ALL MATERNITY UNITS IN ENGLAND ARE 
SIGNING UP TO A BIG NEW RESEARCH 
PROJECT IT WILL LOOK AT THE 
EXPERIENCES OF SIXTY THOUSAND WOMEN GIVING 
BIRTH THE RESULTS WILL PROVIDE 
SOLID EVIDENCE ON WHICH TYPE OF 
BIRTHPLACE IS SAFEST AND THAT IS 
BACKING O. BECOMING MORE IMPORTANT 
AS WOMEN ARE OFFERED MORE CHOICE IN 
HOW AND WHERE TO HAVE THEIR BABY 
ZIMBABWE STATE RUN NEWSPAPER IS 
REPORTING TODAY A SECOND ROUND 
MAYBE NECESSARY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION AS NEITHER ROBERT MUGABE 
OR HIS CHALLENGER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
HAS WON A MAJORITY THE B. B. C. IS 
BANNED FROM ZIMBABWE BUT OUR 
CORRESPONDENT PETER GRESTE SON THE 
COUNTRY'S BORDER WHAT CAN YOU TELL 
US ABOUT THE REPORT THAT PERHAPS 
NOBODY HAS COME OUT AS A CLEAR 
WINNER 
WELL THIS IS AN INTERESTING WINNER ONE ZIMBABWE HERALD IS PREDICTING 
WE ARE HEADING FOR A RUN OFF 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE AND 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI THE LEADER OF 
THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IT SAYS THAT 
THEY ARE HEADING FOR A 
PARLIAMENTARY TIE BETWEEN THE 
RULING ZANU P. F. PARTY AND MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI'S FACTION OF THE M. D. C. AT 
THE MOMENT THE RESULTS PUT IT AT 
NINETY FIVE I THINK FOR THE RULING ZANU P. F. 
NINETY THREE FOR MORGAN TSVANGIRAI'S FACTION 
OF THE M. D. C. BUT THERE IS ANOTHER 
FACTION OF THE M. D. C. A BRAKE AWAY 
FACTION COMPETING SEPARATELY AND 
THEY HOLD FIVE SEATS WHICH WOULD 
PUT THE M. D. C. COMBINED AHEAD OF ZANU 
P. F. IT IS A COMPLICATED SITUATION 
WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE SECOND 
FACTION OF THE M. D. C. WOULD PLAY THIS 
BUT IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IF WE PUT 
THEM TOGETHER THE M. D. C. COMBINED 
WOULD COME OUT AS THE VIC TORS THE 
POINT ABOUT THE HERALD IT IS THE 
STATE RUN NEWSPAPER IT TENDS TO 
REFLECT GOVERNMENT THINKING SO IF 
THEY SAY WE ARE HEAD ING FOR A 
RAUFPB AND WE CAN TAKE IT IT'S A 
REALISTIC PROSPECT HOW WOULD IT 
WORK EVERYBODY WOULD VOTE AGAIN 
WOULD THEY THAT IS RIGHT WE GO 
BACK TO TWO CANDIDATES AT THE 
MOMENT THERE ARE THREE AND 
INDEPENDENT SIMBA MAKONI WHO TOOK 
ROUND TEN PER CENT OF THE VOTE ACCORDING TO 
SOME EARLY ESTIMATES IF WE DO GO 
TO A RUN OFF THEN IN THREE WEEKS 
TIME WE HAVE ANOTHER ELECTION 
BETWEEN A STRAIGHT CONTEST BETWEEN 
ROBERT MUGABE AND MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
THIS IS A DIFFICULT SITUATION 
BECAUSE ZIMBABWE IN ITS HISTORY HAS 
NEVER FACED SUCH A SITUATION AND WE 
SIMPLY DON'T KNOW HOW THE POLLING 
WOULD GO WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE 
SECURITY SITUATION WOULD BE OVER 
THOSE THAT INTERVENING PERIOD 
THANK YOU 
ROAD USER IN ENGLAND AND WALES HAVE 
TO STEER OVER MORE THAN THREE 
MILLION POTHOLES THE ASPHALT 
INDUSTRY ALLIANCE SAYS ROADS ARE 
LEFT SCARRED WITH HOLES AND THE 
REPORT SAYS THERE IS SHORT FALL 
OF ONE BILLION IN BUDGETS A FARM 
WHICH PRODUCES RARE BREEDS OF 
ANIMALS THINKS THEIR NEW ARRIVAL 
COULD BE RECORD BREAKER THEY 
THINK THIS LAMB COULD BE THE SMALL 
NEST THE LAND SHE WAS PERFECT IN 
HEALTH THOSE ARE THE MAIN STORIES 
ALL TRUE NO KIDDING WERE YOU 
TAKEN IN BY THE PENGUIN WE WILL 
REVEAL HOW THE B. B. C. MADE PENGUINS 
FLY ON APRIL FOOL'S DAY THEY DON'T 
REALLY ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME 
DEBATE ABOUT THAT THE PROBLEMS OF 
DEALING WITH AUTISM ARE BEING DEALT 
WITH TODAY ONE CHARITY SAYS NOT 
ENOUGH ARE BEING EDUCATED PROPERLY 
NUALA HAS WRITTEN ABOUT THEIR 
EXPERIENCES AND AFTER THEY FOUND 
HELP FROM FAMILY PET WE WILL 
COME TO THAT IN A MOMENT FIRST DID 
YOU FIND THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT IN 
THE EARLY STAGES 
WE ARE TALKING TO 
CHILDREN ONE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO ONE FIVE 
YEARS AGO SADLY YES THE BATTLE 
WAS THE SAME A LOT OF PARENTS HAVE 
CONTACTED ME SINCE I HAVE WRITTEN 
MY BOOK AND MY BATTLE CONTINUES 
EDUCATIONLY THE NEEDS ARE NOT 
BEING MET SOME CHILDREN THE 
AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING BUT THEY ARE 
BEING MET BUT THEY ARE 
INAPPROPRIATE THEY ARE MAYBE IN 
SPECIAL SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT 
CONDITION SPECIFIC FOR AUTISM OR IT 
IS INADEQUATE OR THEY ARE NOT 
GETTING ENOUGH 
DALE YOUR MUM SEEMS 
TO HAVE FOUND AN AMAZING SOLUTION 
FOR YOU IN A DOG CALLED HENRY 
TELL US BIT ABOUT HIM AND WHY 
THAT SEEMED TO HELP YOU HENRY HENRY DIDN'T HAVE A SCARED LOOK ON HIS 
FACE MOST PEOPLE FIND A FACE SCARY 
BOTH HENRY HAD A MORE TRUSTING LOOK 
SO IT WAS LESS PRESSURISING TALKING 
TO HIM SO MUM AND DAD BROUGHT A 
VOICE TO HIM 
THE VOICE CAME FROM 
WHERE WAS IT A VOICE THAT SO YOU 
SPOKE THROUGH THE DOG WHAT WHAT HAPPENED LOTS OF PEOPLE WILL BE 
FAMILIAR WITH HORRIFIC TANTRUMS 
DURING ONE OF THE TANTRUMS THAT 
COULD LAST FOR AGE MY HUSBAND AS A 
LAST RESORT THE DOG WAS LYING 
ASTRIDE DALE WITH A WORRIED LOOK 
AND MY HUSBAND GRASP ADD VOICE LIKE 
OLD RELIABLE AND SAID THIS IS HENRY 
SPEAKING PLEASE STOP THIS AND 
REMARKABLY DALE TOTALLY RESPONDED 
STOOD UP LOOKS AT THE DOG 
APOLOGISED FOR HIS BEHAVIOUR 
GRABBED HIM BY THE NECK AND SAID 
LET'S GO HENRY WE HAD NO AWARENESS 
WHAT HAPPENED UNTIL DALE PROMPTED 
US LATER THAT EVENING TO USE THIS 
VOICE AND I SAID TO MY HUSBAND GO 
FOR IT AND WE DISCOVERED 
THEREAFTER THAT THAT DOG THAT 
WHEN WE BOTH ADOPTED THAT APPROACH 
THAT THE DOG WITH THE DOG BEING THE 
COMMUNICATOR VIA THE DOG THAT 
DALE'S BEHAVIOUR DALE'S AUTISM 
COULD BE CUT THERE IN AN INSTANT 
VIA THE DOG AND THE DOG ASKED HIM 
TO DO ANYTHING 
SO THAT CHANGED 
THINGS FOR YOU DID IT MAKE YOUR 
EDUCATION AS WELL EASIER 
YES WHEN 
I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL I HAD GOOD 
TEACHERS HELP ME GET THROUGH ANY 
EXAMS AND YEAH MY DOG HELPED ME 
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT HAPPENING WHEN 
YOU WERE PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU WERE 
YOUNGER 
YES REMEMBER MY DOG YOUNGER HELPED QUICKEN THE PROCESS BECAUSE 
MY DOG DIDN'T IS IT IS MY EXAMS FOR 
ME BUT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL I 
GOT GOOD SUPPORT FROM TEACHERS AND 
THEY MANAGED TO HELP ME HOW TO DO 
EXAMS 
AND FUEL LA THAT WAS HENRY EXAMS THE FIRST WHO HAS PASSED ON SADLY 
THERE IS A SECOND 
HENRY TWO 
DOES HE WORK WITH YOUR OTHER HE HE VERY MUCH A PET WHAT DALE WAS 
TRYING TO SAY TEACHERS OURSELF 
WERE INTENSIVELY WORKING WITH DALE 
GIVING HIM CONDITION SPECIFIC 
APPROACHES HOWEVER WHEN IT WAS VIA 
THE DOG IT MADE SENSE TO DALE THAT 
WAS THE PIECE OF THE JIGSAW THAT 
WORKED BUT I THINK IT HELPED HIS 
CONFIDENCE SELF ESTEEM FOR OTHER 
PARENTS PERHAPS LISTENING TO THIS 
FOR YOU IT WAS A DOG IT IS NOT 
NECESSARILY AN ANIMAL FOR EVERYBODY 
WHO HAS A CHILD WITH AUTISM SO 
WHAT SORT OF THING WOULD YOU 
RECOMMEND THEY DO 
MAYBE USE 
OBSESSION BECAUSE PEOPLE WITH 
AUTISM HAVE OBSESSION SOME SAY IT 
IS A BAD THING BUT IT IS A GOOD 
THING IF YOU USE OBSESSION THEY 
WILL BE MORE ENCOURAGED TO LEARN 
IN WHAT SENSE 
BEFORE THE DOG 
ARRIVED DALE AS A CHILD HAD ADOPTED 
WATER MICKEY MOUSE BEST PARENTS 
WILL SCREAM AND THOMAS THE TANK 
ENGINE WHICH IS WHY WHAT YOU DO AS 
DALE SAYS YOU USE THAT OBSESSION TO 
MEET THAT CHILD TO BREAKTHROUGH 
BECAUSE THOMAS ALTHOUGH THEY WERE 
METAL TRAIN THEY WERE ALL 
INTERACTING THEY WERE FRIENDS 
THEY HAD DIFFERENT CHARACTERS AND 
WE ADOPTED THAT BEFORE THE DOG 
SPOKE 
THAT IS HOW HENRY GOT HIS SPOKE NAME 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH COMING NAME UP WERE YOU FOOLED BY OUR FLYING

MARSHALL ARRIVED LATE FOR THE FINAL

BRITISH CHAMPIONSHIPS IN SHEFFIELD 
SHE WAS DISQUALIFIED WHICH MEANS 
SHE WILL MISS OUT ON THE RELAY MEL 
MARSHALL IS BLAMING NO ONE BUT 
HERSELF FOR THE MISTAKE 
IT IS MY OWN RESPONSIBILITY THEY 
SAID IF I PROTESTED THAT I COULD 
YOU KNOW BUT IT WOULD TAKE TWO 
DAYS FOR THE GUYS TO HAVE TO SWIM 
I WAS LIKE IT IS MY MY TEAM MATES 
THEY DESERVE TO BE THERE WHEN I'M 
ANGRY I'M GOOD AND I CAN STORE 
THAT UP NOW IT HAS MADE ME REALISE 
THERE IS NO WAY I'M NOT NOT GETTING 
ON THIS TEAM 
YOU HAVE GOT A WAITING ROOM LIKE IN 
THE DOCTOR'S AND THE MAN OR WOMAN 
COMES AROUND AND SAYS TURNBULL IS 
HERE AND MITCHEN IS HERE MINCHEN 
AND MEL MARSHALL WAS STANDING ON 
THE WRONG SIDE OF THE DOOR 
DAYDREAMING DAYDREAMING SHE HAS A A CHANCE OF QUALIFYING IN 
THE FREE STRILE AND THERE IS AN 
OUTSIDE CHANCE THEY MAY CHANGE 
THEIR MINDS ABOUT THE RELAY TEAM 
BUT WAIT AND SEE 
GOOD LUCK TO MARK FOSTER 
I AM A DAYDREAMER I HAVE SYMPATHY 
AT SOME POINT YOU FIND YOURSELF IN 
THE WRONG PLACE 
READING THE PAPERS WHEN BILL 
TURNBULL LINKS TO YOU AND CHRIS IS 
THERE WITH THE SPORT AND I'M HAVING 
A CUP OF TEA AND BISCUIT AND IT 
HAPPENED TO ME 
I HAVE THAT DREAM ALL THE TIME 
ISN'T IT IT HORRIBLE 
I CONDITION FIND THE STUDIO 
ANYWHERE ANYWHERE IT IS A CHOICE ALL PREGNANT WOMEN 
MUST MAKE WHETHER TO GIVE BIRTH AT 
HOME OR IN THE HOSPITAL RESEARCH 
RESEARCH OPENED THE DEBATE ABOUT 
THE SAFETY OF HOME BIRTHS IT 
SUGGESTS BABIES ARE MORE AT RISK 
WHEN WHEN WOMEN WHO PLAN A HOME 
BIRTH ARE TRANSFERRED TO HOSPITAL 
THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF MIDWIVES SAYS 
THE EVIDENCE ISN'T CLEAR AND MORE 
RESEARCH IS NEEDED JOINING US TO 
DISCUSS THIS IS JOANNA MOORHEAD 
ANDANY FRANCIS A MIDWIFE 
YOU HAD TWO AT HOME AND TWO IN 
HOSPITAL YOU PREFERRED THE BIRTHS 
AT HOME 
WHEN YOU YOU GIV BIRTH AT 
HOME YOU ARE IN YOUR OWN SPACE 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THE MOVE IN 
LABOUR INTO HOSPITAL 
THE ARGUMENT REALLY THOUGH ABOUT 
NOT WHETHER OR NOT YOU SHOULD HAVE 
A HOME BIRTH BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF 
SOMETHING GOES WRONG ISN'T IT 
ANNIE ANNIE IT IS MORE ABOUT WEIGHING UP THE 
RISKS AND THE RISKS ARE LOW THAT'S 
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THAT IS 
STRESSED STRESSED AND IN TERMS OF TRANSFERRING IN IF 
THERE IS A NEED TO TRANSFER IN THE 
POINT OF HAVING MIDWIFE AT HOME 
WE ARE THERE TO WATCH THE LABOUR 
TO BE VERY MUCH SORT OF OBSERVEANT 
AND LISTENING TO THE BABY ALL 
THOSE THINGS AND WE'RE AHEAD OF THE 
GAME IF WE THINK THERE IS ANY 
CAUSE FOR CONCERN WE ARE TALKING 
TO THE WOMAN ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY 
OF TRANSFER WE HAVE DONE IT IN THE 
ANTENATAL PERIOD AND WE MAKE THAT 
AS A SMOOTH TRANSITION INTO 
HOSPITAL IF IT IS NEEDED 
WHAT ABOUT THE DECISION TO HAVE THE 
BABY AT HOME SOME PEOPLE ARE WORE 
QUID ABOUT THAT WORRIED ABOUT IT 
IS IT A SUITABLE PLACE TO HAVE BIBBY BIBBY HAVING BABY IS NOT AN ILLNESS IT 
IS A SOCIAL AND FAMILY EVENTMENT 
AND YOU KNOW UP UNTIL RECENTLY 
WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS HAD BABIES AT 
HOME THAT'S THE PLACE TO DO IT IT 
IS WHERE THEY FEEL SAFE AND SECURE 
WE ARE MAMMALS AND WE GIVE BIRTH 
BEST WHEN WE ARE IN A PLACE WE KNOW 
AND WE KNOW WE ARE PRIVATE AND 
INTIMATE INTIMATE I SUPPOSE YOU NEED TO HAVE YOUR 
DUCKS IN ROW IN SENSE TO THINK 
ABOUT CONTINGENCIES IF SOMETHING 
DOES GO WRONG OR IF THERE IS A 
COMPLICATION WHAT DO WE DO YOU YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE BACK UP IS THERE 
IF YOU NEED TO GO TO HOSPITAL ONE 
OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE SYSTEM IS 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS OVER THE LAST 
FEW YEARS SAID WOMEN SHOULD HAVE 
THE RIGHT TO A HOME BIRTH BUT 
HASN'T THE BACK UP IN PLACE AND 
THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR 
INDIVIDUAL WOMEN TO CHECK OUT THAT 
THOSE SERVICES ARE THERE I THINK 
THERE IS A WILL TO PROVIDE THEM 
ONE OF THE THINGS I FEEL STRONGLY 
ABOUT IS THE WAY WOMEN ARE 
SOMETIMES DEMONISED FOR CHOOSING A 
HOME BIRTH AS IF WE ARE DOING 
SOMETHING DANGEROUS EACH YEAR MY 
HUSBAND AND I I TAKE OUR CHILDREN 
ON A VILLA TO A SWIMMING POOL AND 
TWO OF OUR CHILDREN DON'T SWIM WELL 
WE DO ALL WE CAN TO REDUCE THE THE 
RISKS OF FALLING IN THE SWIMMING 
POOL BUT NO ONE WOULD SAY WE ARE 
BAD PARENTS FOR DOING THAT 
IT IS NOT THE QUESTION OF THE RISKS 
OF BEING AT HOME THERE ARE RISKS 
IN HOSPITAL JUST AS THERE ARE AT 
HOME THEY ARE DIFFERENT RISKS BUT 
THE DEBATE IS MORE ABOUT WHAT IS 
THE MOST APPROPRIATE CHOICE FOR 
EACH WOMAN 
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS PEOPLE SEEM TO 
HAVE TODAY IS THAT ACTUALLY YOU 
KNOW YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE SAME 
MIDWIFE IF YOU ARE GIVING BIRTH IN 
HOSPITAL ARE THERE THE MIDWIVES TO 
GIVE THAT SERVICE IF YOU WANT 
HOME BIRTH THAT YOU WILL KNOW THAT 
PERSON AND THEY WILL BE THERE ON 
THE DAY 
THAT'S THE HUGE ISSUE THAT'S THE 
PROBLEM I AM AN INDEPENDENT 
MIDWIFE AND THE REASON I AM IS 
BECAUSE I WANT TO GET TO KNOW THE 
WOMEN AND WORK WITH THEM ALL THE 
WAY THROUGH BOOK SOMEBODY AT TWELVE 
WEEKS OF PREGNANCY AND SO I AM WITH 
HER AND WE GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER 
AND WE GET TO DISCUSS THIS AND 
CONTINUITY IS THE KEY TO SAFETY IF 
YOU KNOW YOUR MIDWIFE WELL AND YOU 
HAVE HAD THE DISCUSSIONS THEN WHEN 
SOMETHING HAPPENS IF SOMETHING 
HAPPENS IN LABOUR YOU HAVE ALREADY 
BEEN THROUGH THE POSSIBILITY AND 
YOU JUST MAKE THE TRANSITION 
SEAMLESSLY SEAMLESSLY YOUR CONCLUSION WOULD BE DON'T BE 
PUT OFF HOME BIRTH 
DON'T BE PUT 
OFF THE MORE OF US WHO HAVE THEM 
AND TALK ABOUT THEM THE MORE WOMEN 
CAN GET THE IDEA THAT IT IS 
SOMETHING YOU CAN DO AND THERE IS 
HUGE BENEFITS FOR EVERYBODY IN THE 
FAMILY FAMILY HERE IS A QUESTION WE HAVE BEEN 
ASKING ALL MORNING WHERE HAVE THE 
GOOD RIFFS GONE ACCORDING TO 
GUITAR X. MOST WERE WRITTEN TWENTY YEARS 
AGO THEY ASKED THEIR STUDENTS TO

THOSE HOTELS RUN BY ONE MAN BY ONE 
FAMILY AND SEE IF I CAN DISCOVER 
THAT THING SEE IF IT IS STILL 
THERE IT GREW IN MY HEAD FROM NOT 
JUST BEING HOTELS TO BEING 
EVERYTHING L. DON'T WANT TO DRINK 
FROM STARBUCKS I DON'T WANT TO BUY 
FOOD FROM MCDONALD'S OR OTHER BIG 
CHAINS L. WANT TO GIVE MY MONEY TO 
MOM AND POP 
IT IS A CHALLENGE YOU 
YOURSELF 
MOM AND POP YOURSELF 
IF YOU ASK PEOPLE IN YOURSELF LAFPLT THEY THINK IT IS NOT 
POSSIBLE IN L. A. THEY THINK IT IS 
NOT POSSIBLE F. YOU GET TO THE 
SOUTHERN STATES THERE ARE LOADS OUT 
THERE 
YOU WENT FOR INDEPENDENT THERE PETROL STATIONS AS WELL 
THAT WAS 
THE HARDEST PART GETTING PETROL N. 
THE DESERT STATES IT IS O. K. IF YOU 
GET TO IDAHO AND UTAH IT IS 
DIFFICULT NEVADA THOSE PARTS IT 
IS EASY 
WHEN YOU DO THIS YOU GET 
SOME GOOD THINGS AND SOME VERY BAD 
THINGS 
YES YOU DO 
LET'S GET THE THINGS BAD SHALL WE 
THERE WERE BAD 
THERE WAS ONE HOTEL WHERE WE 
COUNTED EIGHTY SEVEN DEAD FLYS ON THE 
WINDOWSILL IT THIS IS MY THEORY 
I WOULD LOVE TO LIVE IN A WORLD 
WHERE IT IS SOMETIMES BRILLIANT 
NOT AVERAGE L. WOULD LIKE TO TAKE 
THE UPS AND DOWNS THE WALLS WERE 
SO THIN THEY WERE NEARLY NET 
CURTAINS THERE WERE NO CURTAINS 
THE FLOOR WAS ROTTEN THEY MAY HAVE 
HAD SKAI BIS RATHER THAN SHAM POO 
IT WAS GREEN RIVER IN U. TAR L. CAN 
NOT TELL YOU THE NAME OF THE HOTEL 
FOR OBVIOUS REASONS THERE WERE 
GUYS IN IDAHO WHO RUN A HOTEL THE 
SHAPE OF A BEAGLE WHY 
THEY HAVE A WHY GIANT DOG BECAUSE WHAT THEY DO FOR 
A LIVING IS CARVE DOGS THEY HAD 
DINER ONE NIGHT AND THOUGHT LET'S 
PUT A BILL BOARD HERE OVER 
BOTTLE OF WINE IT BECAME THREE D. DOG 
THEN THEY THOUGHT WE MAY LET PEOPLE 
STAY IN IT 
THIS IS THE MINIMODEL 
IT IS L. SLEPT IN ITS BELLY MY 
COLLEAGUE SLEPT IN HIS NOSE THE THE DINER IS DISAPPEARING SOME 
FABULOUS DINERS BUT I SUPPOSE THEY 
ARE THIN AS WELL YOU FOUND 
TAYLOR'S SODA FOUNTAIN IN OREGON 
ON THE DAY WE ARRIVED IT WAS 
PERFECT IT WAS SAD IT WAS THEIR 
LAST DAY OF TRADING 
SUDDENLY ALL THE MILES WE TRAVELLED 
SEEMED WORTH IT WALKING IN I 
FOUND THE AMERICA I HAD IMAGINED IN 
A QUINT ESSENTIAL MOM AND POP STORE 
THIS IS WHERE WE HAD OUR FIRST DATE 
ON THE FIRST YEAR THEY OPENED SIXTY ONE 
YEARS AGO 
WE HAVE BEEN MARRIED FIFTY EIGHT 
WHY ARE YOU FILMING IN THESE 
STORES BECAUSE THEY ARE 
DISAPPEARED 
THEY ARE DISAPPEARING DISAPPEARED AND THEY ARE MORE TRUE TO THE 
SPIRIT OF WHAT AMERICA SHOULD BE 
THAT'S RIGHT 
THEY ARE 
AND THE 
CHAINS MEAN THAT EVERY ONE MAKES A 
DIFFERENCE DIFFERENCE WE KNOW THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT 
SPOT 
DON'T CRY 
YOU CAN ONLY DO SO SPOT LONG YOU KNOW 
OH MY DAUGHTER 
FROM PORTLAND ARE YOU A CHEER 
LEADER LEADER THERE ARE FOUR GENERATIONS OF THE 
SAME FAMILY ALL APART FROM THE 
VERY LITTLE BABY WHO ALL WORKED 
BEHIND THE COUNTER AS WELL 
I NEVER 
HAVE BEEN THERE AND I AM FEELING 
SAD ABOUT IT 
THE LOCAL SCHOOL KIDS 
CAME AND SANG SONGS THERE WAS A 
MEMORIAL BOOK A GUY WHO ON THE DAY 
HE WENT BACK HOME FROM VIETNAM WENT 
TO HAVE A MILK SHAKE BEFORE HE SAW 
HIS MUM THAT COUPLE WHO HAD THEIR 
FIRST DATE FIFTY ODD YEARS BEFORE 
AND THEY WERE THERE ON THE LAST DAY 
THE LADY IN YELLOW TOP WHOSE WATER 
S. BROKE ON THE FIRST STALL 
IT SAYS 
SOMETHING ABOUT HOW WE LIVE IN 
WESTERN SOCIETY 
ABSOLUTELY IT WAS 
A TOUR AROUND AMERICA WHERE I WAS 
PUT UP IN CHAIN HOTELS AND IT WAS 
REALLY DEPRESSING BECAUSE THE MOTEL 
I STAYED IN SOMEWHERE WAS IDENTICAL 
TO A TRAVELODGE OFF THE A FOUR IN 
SWINDON THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN 
THE EXPERIENCE L. THOUGHT WHAT IS THE POINT OF TRAVELLING IF YOU GET 
SOMEWHERE WHICH IS THE SAME AS 
WHERE YOU JUST LEFT THINGS SHOULD 
HAVE THEIR OWN CULTURE AND IDENTITY 
FROM WHAT YOU SEE FROM WHAT YOU 
SAW THERE IT IS A DYING BRAND IS 
IT IN AMERICA DO YOU THINK THERE THERE ARE FEWER OF THEM THAN THERE WERE 
TEN YEARS AGO L. SUSPECT THIS 
JOURNEY IT WAS HARD WHEN I DID IT 
THERE IS FAILURE WHICH IS ALL IN 
THE BOOK AS WELL SUCCESSES AND 
FAILURES ALONG THE WAY BUT IN FIFTEEN 
YEARS I THINK IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE 
THESE THINGS ARE DYING OUT PARTLY 
FOR HEALTHY REASONS THE REASON 
TAYLORS WAS CLOSING IS THEIR 
CHILDREN DON'T WANT TO WORK IN 
THERE ANY MORE WE LIVE IN A WORLD 
WHERE YOU GO TO UNIVERSITY YOU 
DON'T HAVE TO BE A GREEN GROCER IF 
YOUR DAD IS A GREEN GROCER IT IS A 
GOOD THING IN A WAY BUT IT IS SAD 
BECAUSE THOSE THINGS CLOSE WHAT WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE CAR 
WE SOLD IT 
IN THE END WE LOST A LOT OF MONEY 
IT BROKE DOWN ONCE A WEEK 
WHAT WAS 
IT 
A NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR FORD TORINO WHEN YOU IT LOOK AT THAT ANGLE FRONT ON IT IS A 
STAR SKI AND HUCH CAR 
STARSKY AND HUTCH CAR L. HAVE A 
LOT ON MY WALL L. HAVE THE HUB CABS 
THEY FELL OFF I PUT ALL THAT FELL 
OFF AS SOUVENIRS ON MY WALL AS LOW 
AS WE GOT AT TIMES THERE ARE 
THINGS WE WERE THREATENED WITH GUNS 
IN MISSISSIPPI RUN OUT OF TOWN BY 
THE POLICE IN MISSISSIPPI AS WELL 
THERE WERE LOW TIMES BUT SUCH HIGH 
TIMES I WOULD DO THE WHOLE THING 
AGAIN
