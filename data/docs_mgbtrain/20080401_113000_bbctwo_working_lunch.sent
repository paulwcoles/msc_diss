GOT HERE IT WAS NOT 
STRAIGHTFORWARD BELIEVE ME IT WAS 
WORTH IT WE START WITH THE FACT 
THAT CHANGES TO BUSINESS TAX RATES 
AND LANDFILL TAX COME INTO EFFECT 
FROM TODAY AND THE NEW TAX YEAR 
STARTS ON APRIL SIXTH SO THIS SUNDAY 
A WHOLE HOST OF CHANGES TAKE PLACE 
TO INCOME TAX CAPITAL GAINS TAX 
AND NATIONAL INSURANCE YOU HAVE 
WRITTEN TO US AND GIVEN US YOUR 
VIEWS JOHN WHITING IS A PARTNER AT 
PRICE WATERHOUSE 
FIRST LET'S LOOK AT TODAY THE TAX 
CLOCK IS TICKING TOO LATE IF YOU 
HAVE NOT DONE SOMETHING TODAY ON 
BUSINESS RATES CORPORATION TAX AND 
THE RATE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TELL 
US MORE 
FROM TODAY THE BEGINNING 
OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR AS OPPOSED 
TO FISCAL WHICH IS INCOME TAX 
THAT IS TODAY WHAT WE ARE GETTING 
IS CHANGES TO CORPORATION TAX RATES 
LET'S LOOK AT THOSE WHAT WE GET IS 
CORPORATION TAX RATES THE MAIN 
RATE COMES DOWN FROM THIRTY PER CENT TO TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT AS 
FOR SMALL COMPANIES THEY ACTUAL LE 
SEE IT GOING UP FROM TWENTY PER CENT MINUS TWENTY ONE PER CENT A 
UNDERNEATH THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF 
CHANGES TO CAPITAL ALLOWANCES THE 
IMPACT OF THAT IS QUITE COMPLEX 
DEPENDING ON WHAT THE BUSINESS IS 
DOING 
YOU MENTION PLANT THAT CAN DOING BE PLANT LITERALLY PLANT AND 
MACHINERY YOUR J. C. B. YOUR BIG LOOMS 
IN A TEXTILE FACTORY FOR A SMALL 
COMPANY A COMPUTER 
GET THEM IN NOW BUT WHO IS 
SHOUTING THE LOUDEST L. IMAGINE 
SMALL BUSINESSS ARE NOT VERY 
PLEASED 
SMALL BUSINESSS ARE NOT 
PLEASED PLEASED THEIR RATE IS COMING UP 
NEXT YEAR IT GOES UP TO TWENTY TWO PER CENT 
DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR 
INVESTMENT MEANS THOSE MIGHT OR 
MIGHT NOT MEAN MORE TAX OVERALL 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT THERE IS NO NET 
TAKE FROM THOSE CHANGES FROM THE 
BUSINESS SECTOR FOR BIG BUSINESS 
IT MEANS THE FINANCIAL SECTOR DOES 
WELL THEIR CAPITAL ALLIANCES ARE 
NOT SO GOOD BUT THEIR RATE COMES 
DOWN MANUFACTURING IS HIT SMALL 
BUSINESS IT IS ALMOST THE OTHER 
WAY AROUND THERE IS A SPECIAL 
ALLOWANCE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT ALLOWANCE FOR SMALL 
BUSINESSES WHICH BUY PLANT KIND OF 
THINGS YOU ALLUDE TO THAT WILL DO 
THEM A LOT OF GOOD IF YOU ARE 
INVESTING THAT WILL CANCEL OUT THAT 
ONE PER CENT RATE RISE IT HAS TO BE SAID IT 
IS KAPISHOUS IT WILL VARY BETWEEN 
BUSINESSES IT MEANS LOOKING AT 
WHAT IT MEANS TO YOU AND YOUR 
BUSINESS 
I HAVE SAID WE'VE HAD A BUSINESS LOT OF E. MAILS SOME HAVE BEEN 
EXTREMELY ANGRY THEY HAVE COME ON 
THE ABOLITION OF THE TEN PER CENT TAX BAND 
THIS IS HAPPENING ON SUNDAY THERE 
IS A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME HERE ARE 
WE TALKING ABOUT LOWER EARNERS AND 
THRESHOLDS WHICH GET YOU INTO TAX 
IN THE FIRST PLACE 
THE CHANGES FOR 
PERSONAL TAX YOU ARE RIGHT LET'S 
THEM OUT FROM THIS SUNDAY 
WHAT WE GET IS THE TEN PER CENT RATE GOES 
BANG IT HAS GONE BUT THE BIG 
COMPENSATION THE MAIN PERSONAL TAX 
RATE BASIC RATE COMES DOWN FROM 
TWENTY TWO PER CENT TO TWENTY PER CENT THE CAPITAL GAINS RATE 
IS CHANGING FLAT RATE GOES TO EIGHTEEN PER CENT 
OF COURSE THE IMPACT AGAIN IS MIXED 
WHAT IT BASICALLY MEANS IS IF YOUR 
INCOME IS BVE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND YOU GAIN MORE 
ON THE BASIC RATE SWING THAN ON THE 
TEN PER CENT ROUND ABOUT LOW EARNERS SOME 
ARE COMPENSATED IF THEY ARE OVER SIXTY FIVE 
PENSIONERS THEY DO WELL WITH HIGH 
PERSONAL ALLOWANCES BUT A LOT OF 
LOW EARNERS EARLY RETIREES THEY 
WILL LOSE OUT THERE IS A LITTLE 
TWEAK FOR A SAVINGS RATE AT TEN PER CENT 
THOSE HIGHER UP THE INCOME SCALE DO 
GAIN BUT A LOT WILL SEE A LOT OF 
THE INCOME TAX GAIN CLAWED BACK 
WITH NATIONAL INSURANCE 
THE CLOCK IS TICKING WE ARE 
SEEING SOME BIG BOSSS IN BUSINESS 
PUTTING IT IN TRUST CAN THE 
ORDINARY MORTALS DO THAT KIND OF 
THING 
PEOPLE WHO SEE THEIR RATE THING GOING UP FROM TEN PER CENT TO EIGHTEEN PER CENT IN MANY 
CASES AND MORE THAN THAT IN SOME 
CASES ARE TRYING TO TAKE ACTION 
AND AS IT WERE NAIL THE TEN PER CENT RATE 
NOW OR NAIL THE INDEXATION SOME 
PEOPLE WILL TRANSFER PROFIT TO 
THEIR SPOUSES TO BANK THERE ARE 
OTHER PEOPLE WHO WILL GAIN THEIR 
RATE WILL COME DOWN TO EIGHTEEN PER CENT COMPLEX 
WE HAVE ANSWERED A LOT OF QUESTIONS 
FROM WORKING LUNCH VIEWERS OVER 
RECENT MONTHS SOME ARE TAKING 
ACTION AGAIN SOME WILL BE CAUGHT 
AND FIND THEIR BILLS GOING UP 
SOMETHING WHICH IS ALWAYS VERY 
CLOSE TO OUR VIEWERS' HEARTS IT 
INFLUENCES THEIR STATE PENSION IS 
NATIONAL INSURANCE PEOPLE WORRY IF 
THEY ARE NOT PAYING FOR THIRTY YEARS TO 
GET THE MAXIMUM WHAT IS HAPPENING 
HERE THE BANDS ARE CHANGING THERE THERE IS IS A SLIGHT TWEAK AT THE BOTTOM 
THE START POINT COMES UP WHEN YOU 
START TO PAY NATIONAL INSURANCE 
BASICALLY IN LINE WITH THE MAIN 
PERSONAL ALLOWANCE ONCE YOU ARE 
STARTING YOU ARE PAYING AT ELEVEN PER CENT IF 
YOU ARE AN EMPLOYEE THE STOP POINT 
FOR THAT ELEVEN PER CENT IS GOING UP FROM SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY A 
WEEK TO SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY A WEEK SO 
POTENTIALLY AT THAT SORT OF 
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND TO FORTY THOUSAND UP WARDS YOU WILL 
SUDDENLY PAY MORE NATIONAL 
INSURANCE SO THAT IS WHAT PART OF 
THIS BALANCING ACT AND OVERALL IT 
IS A SLIGHT PERSONAL TAX CUT BUT 
NOT A HUGE ONE OVERALL AGAIN I 
COME BACK TO IT WINNERS AND 
LOSERS NOT EVERYBODY WATCHING THIS 
WILL BE SMILING SOME ARE SEEING 
SOME STRANGE IMPACTS ON THEIR PAY 
PACKET PACKET THANK YOU 
MONEY IS POURING INTO BANKS IN 
ICELAND BECAUSE OF THE HIGH RATES 
THEY OFFER TO SAVERS A LOT OF YOU 
HAVE ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 
SAVETY OF THESE DEPOSITS SIMON HAS 
BEEN LOOKING IF PROTECTION IS UP IS 
UP TO GEAR THIS IS WHERE THE MONEY 
IS GOING TO ICELAND'S OUTWARD 
LOOKING ECONOMY THE PEOPLE OF 
ICELAND HAVE BEEN KEEN ON BUYING 
BRITISH BUSINESSES NOW THEY WANT 
BRITISH SAVINGS AS WELL VIEWERS 
WHO HAVE INVESTIGATED HAVE FOUND 
GETTING MONEY BACK IF ONE OF THE 
BANKS FAILS COULD BE TORTUROUS PROCESS 
I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW LONG PROCESS IT WOULD TAKE ME L. L. AM NOT SURE 
WHETHER I WOULD RECOVER IN MY 
LIFETIME THE OVERSEAS BANK ARE 
GOING TO BE LOOKING AFTER THEIR OWN 
INTEREST IN THE FIRST PLACE THEIR 
OWN NATIONALS QUITE RIGHT JOE 
PUBLIC IN THE U. K. WOULD COME A VERY 
POOR LAST I WOULD THINK 
THIS IS HOW DEPOSIT PROTECTION 
WORKS FOR ICELANDIC BANKS 
IF IT IS A U. K. BRANCH OF THE BANK 
AND NOT U. K. AUTHORISED THEY CAN 
LEGALLY TAKE DEPOSITS BUT THE 
PROTECTION YOU GET IS WHAT 
CUSTOMERS GET IN THE EUROPEAN 
COUNTRY THE BANK IS FROM THAT IS 
AROUND FIFTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED IN THE CASE OF 
ICELAND SO MUCH LOWER THERE IS 
ANOTHER OPTION THOUGH THAT U. K. 
BRANCH OF THE FOREIGN BANK WHICH 
OPTS INTO THE U. K. SYSTEM SO SAVERS 
GET TOP UP PROTECTION ICELAND'S 
FIFTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED PLUS U. K. ASSISTANCE FOR THE 
REMINDER THE BANK GLENN HAS GONE 
WITH OFFERS PROTECTION SAVERS NEED 
TO CHECK WHETHER THEY ARE GETTING 
THE FULL COVER THEN DECIDE WHETHER 
THEY WANT TO RELY ON SUCH 
COMPLICATED SYSTEM THEY LOOK GREAT 
RATES OF INTEREST A LOT OF PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WORRYING ABOUT 
HOW SAVE THEY ARE 
THEY ARE WORRIED 
ABOUT WHETHER THE PLACE THEY ARE 
PUTTING THE MONEY IS SAFE HERE ARE 
SOME EXAMPLES BRYAN BONNER HAS GOT 
IN TOUCH TO DO WITH THE ICELANDIC 
BANKS AND SAYS IN THE LIGHT OF THE 
NORTHERN ROCK FIASCO 
I AM WORRIES THAT THEY ARE IN FOR 
THE NEXT BIG CRASH JUST ON THAT 
POINT OF A CRASH THE HEAD OF THE 
ICELANDIC CENTRAL BANK COMPLAINED 
THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN THE VICK TICK 
OF AN ASSAULT BY SPECULATERS 
PEOPLE ARE SPREADING RUMOURS THAT 
SORT OF THING YOU KNOW THE WORRIES 
THERE WERE ABOUT HBOS RECENTLY A 
SIMILAR SORT OF THING MOST PEOPLE 
JUDGE THAT ICE LAN DICK BANKS ARE 
FINANCIALLY HEALTHY THEY DON'T 
HAVE THE TOXIC MORTGAGE LOANS FROM 
THE U. S. THAT MANY OTHER EUROPEAN 
BANKS DO L. AM NOT SURE WHETHER IT 
IS JUSTIFIED TO SAY WHETHER THE 
NEXT CRASH IS COMING THERE LET'S 
LOOK AT THE ACCOUNTS THEY ARE 
OFFERING THIS IS WHERE THE 
INTEREST COMES THIS IS WHY SO MANY 
PEOPLE HAVE ASKED 
OF THOSE ONES KAUPTHING HAS FULL 
PROTECTION PROTECTION IF YOU START WITH THE ICE LAN DICK 
ONE THEN YOU GO ABOVE THAT TO THE 
U. K. PROTECTION FIRST SAVE AND I. C. I. 
BANK THEY ARE FULLY AUTHORISED BY 
THE F. S. A. IT IS A COMPLICATED 
SITUATION 
YOU NEVER INVEST IN SITUATION SOMETHING YOU ARE WORRIED MIGHT 
COLLAPSE THIS HYBRID SYSTEM SEEMS 
COMPLICATED HAVE YOU GOT TO DASH 
OFF TO ICELAND HOW DOES IT WORK 
WELL WE GOT IN TOUCH WITH THE ICE 
LAN DICK CENTRAL BANK TODAY AND 
THEY SAID WELL IT WOULD ONLY TAKE 
THREE WEEKS OR SO TO ESTABLISH 
WHETHER THERE WAS COMPENSATION TO 
BE PAID SAY BANK FELL BUT THEN 
THE SYSTEM IS UNTRIED IT HAS NOT 
HAPPENED YET FOR U. K. CUSTOMERS 
TRYING TO GET COMPENSATION WE KNOW 
IT WOULD TAKE MONTHS IF IT WAS A U. K. 
BANK WHAT WOULD IT TAKE IF WE HAD 
TO GO TO ICELAND LET'S LISTEN TO 
GLENN ABOUT WHAT HIS THOUGHTS ARE 
ON THIS 
THEY ARE THE ONES OFFERING THE 
BETTER RATES AT THE MOMENT AND 
THEY PEOPLE SHOULD BE AWARE THAT 
WHILST THEY MAY BE PROTECTED THEY 
WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS 
PROCEDURE BEFORE THEY SAW ANY OF 
THEIR MONEY BACK 
TO BE WITH A BANK 
WHICH OFFERS U. K. PROTECTION THE 
HYBRID PROTECTION HAS THE SAME 
AMOUNT BUT WHAT YOU WANT TO BE 
CAREFUL ABOUT IS IF YOU ARE WITH A 
BANK WHICH ONLY OFFERS THEIR LOCAL 
PROTECTION WHICH IS NOT AS HIGH A 
STANDARD AS U. K. PROTECTION FOR THAT 
YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE F. S. A.'S 
REGISTER YOU CAN LOOK ON THAT AND 
SEE WHETHER THEY ARE U. K. AUTHORISED 
OUB WHAT THEY CALL E. E. A. AUTHORISE 
WHICH IS THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA 
YOU GET THEIR LOCAL ONE THEN YOU 
HAVE TO CHECK WHETHER YOU GET U. K. 
TOP UP AS WELL 
THAT IS ON THE 
SCREEN AT THE MOMENT 
ON CONSUMING ISSUES WE WILL ANSWER 
MORE QUESTIONS ON SAVINGS AND 
INVESTMENT INVESTMENT LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE REST OF 
THE BUSINESS NEWS THE ECONOMIC 
BENEFITS OF IMMIGRATION HAVE BEEN 
OVERSTATED BY THE GOVERNMENT THIS 
IS ACCORDING TO A PARLIAMENTARY 
REPORT WHICH CALLS FOR FUTURE 
NUMBERS TO BE CAPPED THAT REPORT 
SAYS COMPETITION FROM MIGRANTS HAS 
HAD A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE LOW 
PAID AND HAS CONTRIBUTED TO HIGH 
HOUSE PRICES THE GOVERNMENT SAYS 
MIGRATION HAS ADDED SIX BILLION TO 
THE U. K. ECONOMY AND A POINTS SYSTEM 
IS PREFERABLE TO A CAP ON NUMBERS 
A COMMUNICATIONS' WORKERS UNION IS 
TO ANNOUNCE THE CHANGES TO THE 
ROYAL MAIL PENSION INCLUDING THE

TRADE EVENTS AND AT THE COLLEGE

TASTE FOR BUSINESS 
HARRY POTTER WEAVED HIS MAGIC AGAIN

SEVENTEEN POINT NINE MILLION THAT WAS UP TWO HUNDRED FORTY FOUR PER CENT 
THE LAST IN THE SERIES OF THE BOOK 
HARRY POTTER AND THE DEADLY HALLOW 
SOLD OVER ONE MILLION COPIES 
NOW THE SERIES IS OVER YOU HAVE TO 
ASK WHAT IS THIS PUBLISHER GOING TO 
DO IT HAS OTHER BEST SELLING BOOKS

MICROSOFT THE PAPER BACK EDITION 
OF HARRY POTTER'S LATEST EDITION 
WILL BE PUBLISHED IN JULY 
IT DIDN'T FLOAT ON THE STOCK MARKET 
UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND THIS IS WHAT THEIR 
SHARE PRICE IS LET'S LOOK AT THE 
POINT AT WHICH THE LATEST HARRY 
POTTER BOOKS WERE PUBLISHED HARRY 
POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE 
AND THE CHIM BETTER OF SECRETS 
THE SHARES ONLY STARTED RISING 
STRONGLY IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE 
IT DOES FOLLOW THE BOOKS BEING 
PUBLISHED BUT ACTUALLY THERE IS 
SORT OF DELAY BUT YOU CAN'T AVOID 
THE IDEA THAT REALLY HARRY POTTER 
IS BEHIND ALL OF THIS IN FACT IT 
REACHED ITS PEAK TWO THOUSAND FIVE THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE PENCE 
AND IT FELL SHARPLY AFTER THAT 
LET'S LOOK AT THIS TODAY DESPITE 
THE VOLATILITY TODAY IT HASN'T 
BEEN TOO BAD DOWN JUST ABOUT TWO 
PENCE PENCE THERE ARE SOME OF THE OTHER MEDIA 
SECTOR IT IS WORTH NOTING THEY 
HAVE DONE WELL TODAY AND IT HAS 
BEEN A A A SECTOR UNDER PRESSURE 
LET'S LOOK ELSEWHERE 
ANGLO AMERICAN MINING COMPANY 
DOWN B. P. DOWN 
A. B. BARR SHRUGGED OFF COMPETITION 
AND POOR WEATHER TO REPORT RISE 
IN ANNUAL PROFITS THE BUSINESS 
SAYS DESPITE MIXED WEATHER 
IMPORTANT FOR A SOFT DRINKS COMPANY

THE YEAR BEFORE 
GLOBAL RADIO IT AGREED TO PAY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
A SHARE IN CASH IT IS WORTH THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY 
MILLION 
IT IS RECOMMENDED DEAL IT WILL BRING TOGETHER CAPITAL 
RADIO AND HEART F. M. 
A PREMIUM OF EIGHTY SIX PER CENT ON THE CLOSING 
PRICE THIS WAS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE PENCE ON THE 
FOURTH JANUARY THAT WAS THE BUSINESS 
DAY BEFORE NEWS OF THE TAKE OVER 
APPROACH WAS WAS BROKEN AND MADE 
AWARE TO THE MARKETS 
LAND OF LEATHER SAID THAT SLEEP 
DEPOT WHICH OPERATES TWENTY ONE CONCESSIONS 
HAD GONE INTO ADMINISTRATION A 
PROCESS OF FINALISING FINANCIAL 
RESTRUCTURING DUE TO VERY 
CHALLENGING MARKET CONDITIONS IT 
FAILED WHICH THEY RECEIVED ANNUAL 
RENT FROM SLEEP DEPOT OF FORTY EIGHT 
MILLION POUNDS THAT'S WHY IT IS 
SIGNIFICANT FOR THEM IT IS DOWN 
ELEVEN PER CENT QUITE A KNOCK THERE 
THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED HAS GOT TO BE UP IT 
IS IS L. JORDAN WROTE IN ABOUT OTHER 
NUMBERS ALL ABOUT INFLATION AND 
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE 
DIFFERENCE IS R. P. I. AND RRP WAS 
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THE RRP IS 
NOTHING TO DO WITH INFLATION IT 
STANDS FOR RECOMMENDED RETAIL PRICE 
YOU MAY HAVE GOT CONFUSED WITH THE 
MEASURES OF THE COST OF LIVING AND 
THERE ARE TONNES IN THERE AND I CAN 
UNDERSTAND THE CONFUSION 
HERE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS R. P. I. 
RPIX AND HCIP MY FAVOURITE 
C. P. I. LET'S GO THROUGH A COUPLE OF 
THEM YOU WILL HEAR PEOPLE TALKING 
ABOUT THEM IT IS THE CONSUMER 
PRICE INDEX IT IS THE MEASURE 
ADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR THEIR 
U. K. INFLATION TARGET THAT'S WHY WE 
HEAR ABOUT IT A LOT THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND'S MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE 
IS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE A TARGET OF 
TWO PER CENT ON THE C. P. I. SO WE HEAR ABOUT IT 
EVERY TIME THE MONETARY POLICY 
COMMITTEE MEETS PRIORITY TO THE 
END OF DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND THREE THE C. P. I. WAS 
PUBLISHED IN THE U. K. IT WAS CALLED 
SOMETHING ELSE THE HARMONISED 
INDEX OF CONSUMER PRICES 
R. P. I. IS THE RETAIL PRICE INDEX IT 
IS USED AS THE MEASURE TO CHECK 
WHAT RATES PAYMENTS LIKE PENSIONS 
AND STATE BENEFITS SHOULD RISE 
THAT'S WHY THAT IS IMPORTANT 
THAT'S THE DEFINITIONS AS FOR WHAT 
THE RATES ARE C. P. I. THAT'S TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
R. P. I. IS OVER FOUR FOUR PER CENT BOTH MEASURE 
INFLATION AND THEY ARE GIVING YOU 
DIFFERENT FIGURES AND THAT'S 
BECAUSE THEY MEASURE DIFFERENT 
PRICES THE C. P. I. THERE IT IS DOES 
NOT INCLUDE COUNCIL TAX AND 
NUMBER OF OTHER HOUSING COSTS BUT 
THERE ARE SOME SERVICES COVERED BY 
THE C. P. I. SUCH AS FINANCIAL SERVICES 
WHICH ARE NOT IN THE R. P. I. A LOT OF 
PEOPLE SAY THEIR EXPERIENCE OF 
WEEKLY SHOPPING BILL DOESN'T MATTER 
EITHER OF OF THOSE THERE IS A 
PERSONAL INFLATION CALCULATOR YOU 
CAN FIND THAT ONLINE AT 
WHEN YOU GET THERE PUT PERSONAL 
INFLATION CALCULATOR TO FIND THAT
