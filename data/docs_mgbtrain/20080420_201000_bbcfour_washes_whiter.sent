HELLO I'M RUTH DUNNING AND I'M PROUD TO BE TAKING PART IN THE FIRST EVENING OF I. T. A. TELEVISION 
WE HOPE YOU'RE ENJOYING YOURSELVES 
YOU'LL BE SEEING QUITE A BIT OF ME IN SOME T. V. ADVERTISEMENTS FOR PERSIL INTERVIEWING INTERESTING PEOPLE 
TONIGHT I'M PRESENTING THE PERSIL CHILDREN WHO ARE ON T. V. FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THE COMMERCIALS UNVEILED ON THE OPENING NIGHT OF I. T. A. WERE GENTLE AND REASSURING 
A FAR CRY FROM THE BRASH AMERICAN SALESMANSHIP MANY HAD FEARED 
WITH THEIR CARTOONS JINGLES AND REPETITIVE VOICE OVERS THEY WON THE APPROVAL OF CHILDREN 
MURRAY MINTS MURRAY MINTS TOO GOOD TO HURRY MINTS 
COMMERCIALS WERE WONDERFUL 
BECAUSE THEY WERE SHORT REPETITIVE AND USED JINGLES 
WHICH REPLACED THE NURSERY RHYME 
BIRDS EYE PEAS SWEET AS THE MOMENT WHEN THE POD WENT POP 
MANY WORKING CLASS CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR WERE SUNG TO SLEEP WITH ADVERTISEMENT JINGLES 
JINGLES WERE A PART OF THE CULTURE BETTER KNOWN THAN NURSERY RHYMES 
THE HAPPIEST WAY OF EATING FISH BIRDS EYE FISH FINGERS 
THEY COULD SING ALL THE JINGLES 
AND THEREFORE MANY PEOPLE SAID THAT CHILDREN WOULD BE BRAINWASHED INTO WANTING THE PRODUCTS 
GEORGIE PORGIE 
HELLO SOOTY'S MAKING SOME SOUP 
LOOKS A BIT WATERY AN OXO CUBE 
A LITTLE BIRD TOLD ME TO TELL YOU BIRDS IS BEST 
BRYLCREEM BRYLCREEM BRYLCREEM 
EARLY COMMERCIALS LOOKED INFANTILE 
BUT WERE DESIGNED TO APPEAL TO ADULTS 
THE EARLY COMMERCIALS SEEM TO TALK LIKE A PATIENT PARENT TO A CHILD 
IN WINTER YOU NEED BOVRIL DAILY 
THANK YOU LITTLE BOVRIL FOR YOUR ADVICE 
WE HAD THE IDEA THAT COMMERCIALS WERE TO EXPLAIN THINGS TO PEOPLE 
WE BUILT THEM BRICK BY BRICK TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD 
THE AMERICANS TAUGHT US THE VALUE OF REPETITION 
AND NEVER TO OVER ESTIMATE THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE PUBLIC 
GOOD OLD MUM ALWAYS REMEMBERS 
TO BRING HOME SOME WALL'S ICE CREAM 
MUM DIDN'T LIKE BEING TREATED LIKE A CHILD 
MORE SOPHISTICATED ADVERTISING ADDRESSED HER AS A MUM 
WHAT IS A MUM 
A MUM IS SOMEONE TO COME HOME TO 
A MUM IS SOMEONE WHO SAYS PLEASE SIT DOWN TO EAT YOUR TEA 
FEW BRANDS EXPLOITED MOTHER LOVE AS MUCH AS PERSIL 
THE ULTIMATE TEST OF A GOOD MOTHER WAS HER DEVOTION TO THE WASH 
A MUM IS SOMEONE WHO USES PERSIL 
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS PERSIL IS GENTLE BUT THOROUGH IT GETS CLOTHES WHITER 
IN FOOD COMMERCIALS A WOMAN WAS JUDGED BY THE QUALITY OF HER CHILDREN'S DIET 
AND MARMITE CONTAINS ESSENTIAL B. TWO VITAMINS TO KEEP YOUR FAMILY FIT 
THEY'RE WORKING UP AN APPETITE 
AND YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO FEED THEM PROPERLY WITH PROTEIN 
EVEN SWEETS HAD A NUTRITIONAL NOTE 
MARS CONTAINS GLUCOSE AND SUGAR 
TO GIVE YOU ENERGY WHILE YOU WORK 
MILK TO NOURISH YOU AS YOU RELAX AND CHOCOLATE TO HELP YOU PLAY 
THE CHILD OF NINETEEN FIFTIES ADVERTISING WAS DEPICTED AS FRAIL AND VULNERABLE 
TUCKED UP IN BED BY A VIGILANT MUM 
THE YOUNG MAN IS ILL IN BED OR IS HE 
HEY YOU SHOULD BE IN BED 
YES SICKNESS CAME WITH WINTER 
COLDS AND FLU AROUSED GENUINE FEARS 
MANY BRANDS OFFERED CURES 
BY MORNING HE WAS SO MUCH BETTER 
GET NEW VICK 
IN WINTER YOU NEED BOVRIL DAILY 
IN HOMES AND HOSPITALS EVERYWHERE LUCOZADE AIDS RECOVERY 
CENTRAL HEATING HARDLY EXISTED 
AND A COROLLARY OF THAT WAS THAT INFLUENZA WAS ABSOLUTELY EPIDEMIC 
SO LUCOZADE WAS AN ESSENTIAL PRODUCT 
WHICH WAS PART AND PARCEL OF GETTING PEOPLE WELL AFTER SICKNESS 
I SUPPOSE THERE WAS A TENDENCY IN THE EARLY DAYS OF I. T. A. 
FOR MANUFACTURERS OF CERTAIN FOODS TO USE OUTRAGEOUS NUTRITIONAL CLAIMS 
WHICH WERE NOT WHOLLY JUSTIFIED 
BOVRIL BUILDS UP RESISTANCE TO INFECTION 
THERE WERE OFTEN MEETINGS INVOLVING ADVERTISING AGENTS AND OFFICIALS AND THE EXPERT IN THE FIELD 
TO ENSURE THAT FUTURE CLAIMS WOULD REFLECT WHAT THE PRODUCT CONTAINED 
LUCOZADE WITH ITS LIQUID GLUCOSE 
IS SAFE QUICK PROVED AND EASILY TAKEN 
VITAMIN C. BUILDS UP RESISTANCE TO COLDS SO YOU HAD RIBENA DAILY 
OTHER BRANDS OFFERED TO PROTECT THE CHILD AGAINST PERILS OTHER THAN THE CLIMATE 
CHILDREN ARE BEAUTIFUL 
HARPIC IS NOT BEAUTIFUL IT DOES AN UGLY JOB RUTHLESSLY 
THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT DANGEROUS GERMS BUT YOU DO 
DOMESTOS MAKES TOILETS GERM FREE 
EVEN THE WASHING UP 
WAS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF CHILD CONTAMINATION 
THERE WERE EVEN HIDDEN RISKS FROM A WOMAN'S BREATH 
IS HER WHOLE MOUTH PURE NOW SIGNAL IS HERE 
IF MOTHERS HAD TO PROVIDE TOTAL CLINICAL PROTECTION 
THEY EXPECTED WELL BEHAVED CHILDREN WHO ALWAYS CAME WHEN CALLED 
COME ON CHILDREN TEA'S READY 
THEY ALWAYS ATE IN SILENCE 
THEIR FIRST WORD WAS MUMMY 
MUMMY SAYS WHEN I'M BIG I'LL GO INTO WOOLWORTHS WITH MONEY 
MUMMY SAYS I'VE TO LOOK AT THE RHYME 
MUMMY WANTS A NEW HOOVER BECAUSE SHE'S GOT WORK TO DO 
THIS IS HOW LITTLE GIRLS LEARN DOING WHAT MUM DOES AND SAYING WHAT MUM SAYS' 
BUT THESE PERFECT CHILDREN HAD A JOB TO PERFORM 
ASKING MOTHER A FEW QUESTIONS 
WHY DO BABIES SLEEP SO MUCH DOES SLEEP HELP PETER TO GROW SLEEP AND COW AND AMP GATE 
WHAT'S THIS MUMMY HEINZ TOMATO SOUP DARLING OUR FAVOURITE 
DO YOU WANT IT SOFT OH YES 
WHY IT HELPS KEEP MY HANDS SOFT 
NOW HANDS THAT DO DISHES CAN FEEL SOFT AS YOUR FACE 
WITH MILD GREEN FAIRY LIQUID 
WASHING UP IS REALLY NOT VERY INTERESTING 
AND HERE THE ADVERTISER CAN REPEAT THE MERITS OF FAIRY LIQUID 
WITHOUT SEEMING IDIOTIC WHY 
BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MOTHER AND HER LITTLE GIRL 
IS PART OF BEING A SUCCESSFUL MUM WHY 
THIS IS THE MUM WHO ALWAYS ANSWERS THE QUESTIONS WHO IS PATIENT 
WHO DOESN'T SAY IF YOU ASK ME ANOTHER QUESTION I'LL SCREAM 
WHY CHILDREN WERE RECRUITED TO INQUIRE ABOUT BRANDS 
AND WERE ENCOURAGED TO PESTER FOR THEM 
A TUBE OF SMARTIES MEANS LOTS OF CHOCOLATE BEANS YOU GET LOTS AND LOTS OF SMARTIES 
BUY SOME FOR LULU 
ASK MUM FOR A WALL'S FAMILY BRICK 
MUM GOT THIS FROM THE GROCER ASK YOUR MUM FOR ONE 
DON'T FORGET MY FRUIT GUMS MUM 
ROWNTREES FRUIT GUMS LAST THE LONGEST 
THAT'S WHY WE ALL SAY 
DON'T FORGET THE FRUIT GUMS MUM 
HERE ONE IS USING THE POWER OF T. V. TO GET THE VERY YOUNG CHILD TO PESTER MOTHER 
SO WE WERE FORCED TO INTRODUCE A NO PESTERING RULE 
NOW IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE YOU MAY NOT MAKE ANY REFERENCE IN THE COMMERCIAL 
TO ASK MOTHER TO BUY 
ROWNTREES CLEVERLY CHANGED THE WORDING 
DON'T FORGET THE FRUIT GUMS CHUM 
INCITING PESTERING WAS BANNED 
BUT FREE GIFTS AND SPECIAL OFFERS WERE NOT 
A BIG MODEL OF ME FOR ONLY EIGHT SIXTHS 
SUBMARINE DEAD AHEAD STAND BY 
IT'S A REAL WORKING MODEL OF THE FIRST ATOMIC POWERED SUB 
WHICH USES BAKING POWDER FOR FUEL 
THIS IS SMASHING ISN'T IT IT'S GOT TWO STAINLESS STEEL BLADES 
CHILDREN ALSO HAD PURCHASES TO MAKE THEMSELVES 
WITH AN EYE ON THEIR POCKET MONEY 
WALL'S BEGAN TO TARGET CHILDREN WITH GREATER PRECISION 
OUR FIRST APPROACH WAS THAT CHILDREN WERE DIVIDED BY AGE 
BUT OF COURSE YOU CAN GET A THREE TO FIVE YEAR OLD 
WHO PROBABLY HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH A FIVE TO SEVEN YEAR OLD 
IT WAS BETTER TO CLASSIFY THEM BY THEIR INTERESTS 
RESEARCH REVEALED ADVENTURERS HUNGRY HORACES AND LITTLE MADAMS 
LITTLE MADAMS WERE GIRLS WHO KNEW WHAT THEY WANTED IN A SHOP 
SOME PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY WANT 
ADVENTURERS WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE SHAPE AND THE WRAPPER 
ENJOY A DOUBLE FLAVOURED LOLLY 
HUNGRY HORACES WANTED FOR THREE D. AS MUCH ICE CREAM AS POSSIBLE 
BIG INNIT THERE'S RASPBERRY LEMON OR STRAWBERRY IT'S NEW 
OOH WALL'S WOPPA 
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING CARTOONS WERE A MAIN STAY OF CHILDREN'S ADVERTISING 
A CARTOON IS A CHILDREN'S LANGUAGE SO THEY KNOW IT'S MEANT FOR THEM 
SECONDLY THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH CHILDREN WATCHING OTHER CHILDREN IN COMMERCIALS 
THEY OFTEN DON'T LIKE THEM SO A CARTOON GETS OVER THAT 
THIRDLY YOU CAN DO THINGS WITH CARTOON CHARACTERS THAT YOU CAN'T DO WITH REAL PEOPLE 
HITTING PEOPLE IS A JOKE 
IF IT WAS FOR REAL IT'D BE VIOLENT 
ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR CARTOON CHARACTERS WAS TONY THE TIGER 
HE WAS ORIGINALLY DEPICTED AS AGGRESSIVE AND FEARLESS 
HE HAD SHARP TEETH AND A VERY LOUD ROAR 
HE WAS VERY ARROGANT 
THROW THE SPOTLIGHT ON ME BOY 
WITH TIME HIS PERSONALITY CHANGED 
KELLOGGS FILED DOWN HIS TEETH 
AND TURNED HIM INTO A LOVABLE LOSER 
TONY YOU BETTER SEE THE DOC 
I JUST SAW IT 
TO CHILDREN HE'S VERY OBVIOUSLY NOT A CHILD 
BUT HE'S WHATEVER THEY WANT HIM TO BE OH BOY 
BOYS OF NINE AREN'T INTERESTED IN A CUDDLY TIGER THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THE IN BUILT JOKE 
WATCH THIS 
TONY THINKS HE'S A HERO BUT ALWAYS GETS CAUGHT OUT 
GIRLS RESPOND MUCH MORE TO HIS VULNERABILITY AND CHARM 
WHAT HAPPENED SKIP IT 
IT REALLY IS A CASE OF FEMINISTS EAT YOUR HEART OUT WITH CHILDREN UNDER ELEVEN 
I'VE BUILT A TRANSPORTER WITH A CRANE 
I'VE BUILT THIS LEGO HOUSE 
I'VE BUILT A REAL LEGO TRACTOR 
THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SEXES WAS MOST APPARENT IN TOY COMMERCIALS 
LOOK IT'S BABY FIRST STEP 
SHE WALKS LIKE YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE A TODDLER 
REAL TOUGH TOYS FOR REAL TOUGH BOYS TONKA 
GIVE BOY TONKA TOY MIGHTY TOUGH 
IF YOU USE GIRLS IN COMMERCIALS YOU CAN ALIENATE THE BOYS 
GIRLS CAN ACCEPT A BOY WINNING IN A COMMERCIAL 
I'VE WON 
I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS A GOOD THING BUT IT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN REAL LIFE 
THE ADVERTISERS AREN'T TO BLAME IT'S A FUNCTION OF OUR SOCIETY 
IN THE SIXTIES THE MISCHIEVOUS BOY WAS POPULAR 
HIS ARRIVAL IN COMMERCIALS REFLECTED A SHIFT IN ATTITUDES TOWARDS CHILD REARING 
ONE NO LONGER LIKED THESE CHILDREN YOU COULD BE PROUD OF YOUR CHILD IF HE WAS A LITTLE DEVIL 
WHEN THEY'RE WELL HOW D'YOU COPE 
TO BE A DEVIL WAS TO BE HEALTHY AND NORMAL AND INDEPENDENT 
THESE NAUGHTY BOYS' CRIME WAS UNSUPERVISED EATING BETWEEN MEALS 
YOU COULD EAT A MILLION AND STILL WANT MORE 
YOU CAN EAT THEM ANYWHERE 
AND YOU'LL GET UP TO SIXTY FIVE CRACKERS IN A BOX 
MYSELF I'M USING FORTY EIGHT 
COURSE AUNT ET DOESN'T KNOW YET 
BUT I'M SURE SHE'LL BE PLEASED 
NOW WE HAD THE INDEPENDENT CHILD'S UNRULY PEER GROUP THE GANG 
FUNNY FACES HEY HEY HEY 
TRUST WALL'S TO HAVE THE GOOD IDEAS AND THEY MAKE SUCH GOOD ICE CREAM 
GANGS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH FORMS OF REBELLION OR NAUGHTINESS 
IT'S A USEFUL TOOL AS CHILDREN WILL WANT TO BE PART OF IT 
WHEN THE TUBES ARE EMPTY I STAMP ON THEM AND THEY GO POP 
WHAT A LOT YOU'VE GOT YEAH 
EVEN TODDLERS MIMICKED THE ANTICS OF TEENAGE BROTHERS AND SISTERS 
YEAH YEAH YEAH SMARTIES 
SMARTIES SMARTIES 
SMARTIES 
THE NEW GROUP THE RUMBLERS PLAYING BURNS ELECTRIC GUITARS 
YOU CAN WIN A GUITAR LIKE THEIRS IN A NEW KELLOGGS COMPETITION 
THE TEENAGER BECAME FOR THE FIRST TIME A MAJOR TARGET FOR ADVERTISERS IN THE SIXTIES 
BECAUSE THIS REPRESENTED THE FIRST ECONOMICALLY VIABLE TEENAGE MARKET EVER IN EUROPE 
THE TEENAGER HAD THE MONEY TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS WHICH WERE NOT NECESSITIES 
MANFRED MANN ANIMALS JOE A MYSTERY GROUP 
THERE WAS AN INTERESTING COLLISION BETWEEN AVAILABILITY OF MONEY 
ADVERTISERS IDENTIFIED THAT TEENAGERS HAD ENORMOUS SPENDING POWER 
AND THE FACT THAT THEY WERE MEDIA AWARE AND EASY TO GET AT 
I AM I SUPPOSE JUST STARTED WORK 
I LIKE A FEW SWEETS BUT I'M PARTICULAR 
I BUY ROWNTREES FRUIT GUMS 
TEENAGERS HAD TO BE LIFE LIKE 
WHILE AVOIDING THE REPUTATION OF THE BADLY BEHAVED TEDDY BOY 
FOR THESE YOUNG ADULTS THE HEIGHT OF SOPHISTICATION WAS ADMISSION TO THEIR PARENTS' DINNER DANCES 
MARY GUESS WHERE I WAS LAST NIGHT 
HARRY TOOK ME DANCING AND MY HAIR WAS A TERRIFIC SUCCESS 
ANOTHER TEENAGE STEREOTYPE WAS THE SELF CONSCIOUS SONG AND DANCE ROUTINE 
AND SHINING WHITE 
IT'S THE NEW HOME PERM FOR LOVELY GIRLS 
DUET THE LIQUID CREAM HOME PERM DUET DUET DUET 
JUDY'S PRETTY AND JUDY'S GOOD 
BUT LITTLE JUDY NEVER NEVER COULD RESIST THE CHOCS IN DAIRY BOX 
THOSE LOVELY CENTRES IN DAIRY BOX 
BUT THESE STIFF POSES FAILED TO IMPRESS THE YOUTH MARKET 
TEENAGERS WOULD HAVE TO BE PORTRAYED WITH MORE ABANDON 
AMERICAN ROCK'N'ROLL MAY HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED AS DECADENT 
BUT ADVERTISERS COULD NOT AFFORD TO IGNORE ITS APPEAL 
AGENCIES HAD TO LEARN THAT THE TEENAGE MARKET WAS EXTREMELY RESPONSIVE TO VISUAL SYMBOLISM 
SO ADVERTISERS LOOKED AND LISTENED TO THE POP PROMOTION MEN 
READY STEADY GO WAS IMPORTANT 
AS BRITISH POP GAINED MOMENTUM BRANDS REPOSITIONED TO CASH IN 
RICE KRISPIES EVEN HIRED THE ROLLING STONES FOR THEIR IMAGE 
RICE KRISPIES FOR YOU AND YOU 
THE SNAP SAYS THEY'RE NICE 
LISTEN TO THE CRACKLE OF THE RICE 
HEAR THE POP THAT SAYS IT TWICE I'M TALKING ABOUT RICE KRISPIES 
BEING A TEENAGER WASN'T ALL FUN 
YOU'RE THE HIT WHY 
WHAT'S THAT THE COLGATE RING OF CONFIDENCE 
AS ADVERTISERS CONSTANTLY REMINDED THEM THE PROBLEMS OF ADOLESCENCE WERE NEVER FAR AWAY 
PERSPIRATION COULD LEAD TO ODOUR 
JOE USED TO WORRY ABOUT HIS HAIR 
CAN HE BE CERTAIN HIS WHOLE MOUTH IS PURE 
I THOUGHT HAVE I GOT BO 
ADVERTISERS WERE RUTHLESSLY RATIONAL 
TEENAGERS ARE GOING THROUGH MANY ANXIETIES AS THEY MATURE 
IT IS LOGICAL THAT SOME WOULD BE ABOUT HOW OTHERS PERCEIVE THEM 
WHETHER AS AN ACCEPTABLE PERSON OR AS A LOVE OBJECT 
A FRIEND TOLD ME WHAT WAS WRONG 
B. O. 
THIS PRODUCT CATEGORY WAS RELEVANT TO TEENAGERS AND THE FAMILY 
LIVING AT TODAY'S PACE IT'S HARD TO STAY FRESH 
SAY NO TO BO WITH LIFEBUOY 
MEANWHILE ADULT SOCIETY HAD TO KEEP UP WITH TEENAGERS' PACE 
ENERGEN MEETS THE MARCH AGAINST STARCH 
MARCH AGAINST STARCH WITH ENERGEN CRISPBREAD 
IN THE MID SIXTIES YOU GET THE YOUTH CULTURE AND ITS VALUES AND DREAMS 
AND IT TAKES OVER EVERYTHING 
THE TEENAGE VALUES HAD BECOME THE NEW SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE ASPIRATIONAL STYLE 
SPEED MOBILITY YOUTH 
IN THE SIXTIES EVERYBODY WAS SEEKING A NEW YOUTH 
HE'S A PICNIC NIK 
SHE'S A PICNIC NIK 
WHAT MAKES HER TICK 
COME ON BE A PICNIC NIK 
BUT AS THE DECADE CLOSED THE DREAM BASED ON SPEED AFFLUENCE AND YOUTH WAS ABOUT TO CRASH 
THE TIMES ASKS 
IS IT THE BRIGHT STUDENTS WHO DEMONSTRATE OR THE NOT SO BRIGHT 
THE BOOM ON WHICH THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE TEENAGER HAD BEEN PREDICATED HAD STOPPED IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX 
TEENS CONFUSED PERSON POWER WITH POLITICAL POWER IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT AND CAUSED RIOTS 
YOU ALSO HAD THE START OF YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE SEVENTIES 
THERE WAS NO UNIFIED YOUTH MARKET FOR ADVERTISERS TO ADDRESS SO YOU GET CRACKS IN THE TEENAGE DREAM 
AT SIXTEEN DID YOU LIVE FOR A BIKE MUSIC A GIRLFRIEND 
YOU HAD NO SKILLS OR QUALIFICATIONS SO WHERE ARE YOU NOW 
NOW A NEW CHILD WAS TO TAKE CENTRE STAGE IN ADVERTISING 
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND 
WHY SENSIBLE AND MATURE PEOPLE 
I WANTED A REAL CHARACTER 
YOU KNOW AN UGLY KID WITH SPOTS WHO WAS REAL WHO YOU FELT WAS A REAL PERSON 
YOU PUT A LITTLE BAG EACH WEEK INTO HORACE 
THE HALLMARK OF THIS NEW CHILD WAS A TENDENCY TO MAKE MISTAKES 
AND SURPRISINGLY THIS WAS JUST WHAT THE ADVERTISERS WANTED 
AND MORE OR LESS THAT'S HOW I GOT WHERE I AM TODAY 
TO THINK TWO YEARS AGO I HAD NOTHING 
IF THE KID MADE A MISTAKE IT DIDN'T MATTER 
IT JUST REMINDED YOU THAT THIS WAS A REAL KID 
MUM SAYS THEY MAKE ME STRONG 
I DON'T KNOW HEINZ BEANS COME FROM BUT I KNOW WHERE THEY GO 
THE HEINZ BEANS KIDS WERE MORE NATURAL 
THEY WERE FROM DIFFERENT AREAS NOT LITTLE ELOCUTORY BOURGEOIS 
I ALWAYS EAT HIS BEANS UP THEY WERE LIKE THE VIEWERS' KIDS 
DON'T BE MEAN WITH BEANS MUM 
EVEN STAGE SCHOOL CHILDREN WERE ALLOWED REGIONAL ACCENTS 
ERE WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING 
HE'S BEEN TO T'DENTIST I'LL HAVE MY FOUR LATER 
DON'T YOU LIKE WEDDINGS BEN NO GIMME BEEFBURGERS ANY DAY 
BEEFBURGERS AT A WEDDING 
WITH THE REALISM OF CHILDHOOD CAME AN IDEALISED INNOCENCE 
THINK ABOUT THE SUNSHINE 
THINK ABOUT THE SUMMERTIME 
GALES GALES GALES PASS THE HONEY PLEASE 
IN AN UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CLIMATE CHILDREN SYMBOLISED A GOLDEN ERA 
A MOTHER'S OWN CHILDHOOD WAS NOSTALGICALLY REPACKAGED AND SOLD 
SCHOOLDAYS WERE THE HAPPIEST DAYS OF YOUR LIFE BUT NOT AT THE TIME 
LOOKING BACK AT IT IT WAS WONDERFUL 
WE ALL LIVED LIKE HOVIS KIDS IN THIS WONDERFUL GOLDEN WORLD OF TRANQUILLITY 
LAST ON T'ROUND WOULD BE OLD MA PEGGARTY'S PLACE 
T'WAS LIKE TAKING BREAD TO THE TOP OF THE WORLD 
MY MOTHER GAVE IT TO ME 
MOTHERS WERE OFFERED AN ESCAPE INTO THE PAST 
BUT ALSO HAD TO GIVE THEIR FAMILIES A REFUGE FROM THE PRESENT 
EGG BACON AND HEINZ SPAGHETTI 
HOW WAS THE COOKING NOT TOO MANY MOSQUITOES NOT TOO RAINY 
THE SONGS GING GANG GOOLY 
SPAGHETTI ALL RIGHT LOVE 
IT'S NICE TO BE HOME MUM 
IF THE WORLD WAS DAMP AND DISMAL 
MOTHER WAS ALWAYS READY TO COMFORT WITH THE HELP OF THE BRAND 
CUP OF BOVRIL YES PLEASE MUM 
COME ON OUT TIM 
WILL YOU COME OUT FOR A BISCUIT 
I WASN'T INVITED TO KAREN'S PARTY 
THE CHILDREN WERE OFTEN SEEN AS VICTIMS 
AT THIS POINT IN THE SEVENTIES PERHAPS MUM WANTED TO GO BACK TO WORK 
THE TRADITIONAL PULL PUSH THAT EVERY WOMAN FEELS WAS COMING TO A HEAD 
IT WAS A REASSURANCE TO THE MOTHER THAT IT WAS O. K. TO GO ON BEING A TRADITIONAL MOTHER 
BECAUSE THEY NEEDED YOU 
SO YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL BAD ABOUT IT 
LITTLE THINGS MATTER TO A BIRD'S EYE MUM 
ONCE MUM AND THE PRODUCT HAD DONE THEIR BIT 
THERE WAS OFTEN A ONE LINER AT THE END TO SHOW ALL WAS WELL 
NEXT WEEK WE'RE GOING TO MAKE PAPER ANIMALS 
I'M CENTRE FORWARD NEXT WEEK 
IN THOSE COMMERCIALS YOU HAVE A SENSE OF VERY SETTLED VALUES 
AT A TIME WHEN THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION IN THE DIVORCE RATE AND SO ON 
I THINK THERE WAS A GROPING FOR IDEALISTIC VALUES OF FAMILY 
WHICH WERE ALREADY BEING ERODED BY A VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES 
BUT IF MOTHERS WERE SPENDING LESS TIME WITH THEIR CHILDREN ADVERTISERS PROMISED TO HELP 
AND YOU CAN'T ALWAYS BE THERE 
ALWAYS WATCH OVER YOUR FAMILY 
YOU WANT TO PROTECT YOUR CHILDREN COLGATE HELPS WITH THEIR TEETH 
WITH THE HELP OF THE BRAND MOTHERS COULD EXTEND THEIR PROTECTION 
AT TIMES LIKE THIS YOU NEED YOUR BREAKFAST CEREAL FOR WARMTH 
WITH THE RIGHT FABRIC CONDITIONER CHILDREN COULD CARRY MOTHERLY LOVE WHEREVER THEY WENT 
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY WHO IN MOTHER'S EYES NEEDS SOFTNESS MOST 
IS THE YOUNGER FAMILY MEMBER 
I HAD THE IDEA OF THE EXTENDED PROTECTIVE WOMB 
IF YOU CLOTHED THEM IN SOFTNESS THAT SOFTNESS COULD GO WITH THEM 
AND YOU WERE WITH THEM 
LATER THE CHILD RUNS TO MOTHER 
THE EXTENDED WOMB IS WITHDRAWN AND THE CHILD IS HOME AGAIN 
SOFTNESS IS A THING CALLED COMFORT 
AS THE SEVENTIES DREW TO A CLOSE 
MANY BRANDS WOULD FIGHT SHY OF THE SENTIMENTAL USE OF CHILDREN 
THE EIGHTIES' CHILD HAD A MIND OF ITS OWN 
THATCHER'S CHILDREN ARE COMPARED TO THEIR FOREBEARS IN THE FIFTIES AND THE SIXTIES 
FAR LESS NAIVE FAR MORE WORLDLY WISE FAR MORE REALISTIC 
THAT WAS PATHETIC THAT'S NICE 
EIGHTIES' CHILDREN WERE WISE 
HOW DID YOU KEEP UP WITH THE Q. E. TWO I WAS IN THEIR SWIMMING POOL 
MY MUM ALWAYS GETS CADBURY'S FINGERS WHEN THERE'S A BIRTHDAY 
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF BIRTHDAYS LATELY KEVIN WHERE DID YOU BURY THE CAR 
IN THE SAND NOT MUCH HELP NO 
CHILDREN ARE NOW MINI ADULTS 
OUR ATTITUDE TO CHILDREN HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY TO MAKE THEM MORE SELF SUFFICIENT 
WE MAKE THEM LIKE MINI ADULTS 
WORKIN' NINE TO FIVE WITH SERVICE AND DEVOTION 
WITH PETITE NINE HUNDRED NINETY 
THIS ADULT CHILD WAS PORTRAYED USING AN ADULT VOICE OVER 
ANOTHER MILK SHAKE MM 
CHOCCY TOPPING GO ON 
THE TENDER HOME COMINGS OF THE SEVENTIES HAD BECOME AN ADVERTISERS' JOKE 
FEED ME 
YOU CAN TELL WHAT THEY WANT FEED ME NOW 
THE MONSTER OF CHILD DEMAND WAS NO MERE FICTION 
ADVERTISERS TURNED THEIR ATTENTION TO THE RISE OF PESTER POWER 
THIS MEANS USING CHILDREN TO INITIATE THE PURCHASE OF A PRODUCT WHICH THEY MIGHT EAT OR USE 
BUT THEY ARE NOT HISTORICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASING DECISION 
ADVERTISERS COULD TARGET CHILDREN QUITE LEGALLY BY PROMISING FUN 
FOODS WERE BRIGHTLY PACKAGED 
AND NEW CHARACTERS DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY TO APPEAL TO CHILDREN 
WE'RE THE BEAN STREET KIDS 
NOODLE DOODLE CAME TO TOWN WITH LOTS OF STRAIGHT SPAGHETTI 
ANTI SOCIAL ELEMENTS WERE JUST A SIGN OF THE TIMES 
TO FIND A SYMBOL FOR AN AGE YOU'D LOOK AT THE PUPPET CHARACTERS WHICH APPEAL TO CHILDREN 
SUCH AS THE ONE WE USED TO SELL SUN PAT PEANUT BUTTER 
GILBERT IS ANARCHIC NOW YOU'RE TALKING MAD HE'S ZANY 
AND HE'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE 
OF THE DISCREET CHARMING AND COMPLETELY CHAPERONED PUPPET OF THE FIFTIES 
BUT ANARCHY WAS CLOSE TO THUGGERY 
WEETABIX O. K. 
IT'S THE AGE OF FOOTBALL HOOLIGANS AND TROUBLE IN THE STREETS AND SKINHEADS 
AND THE WEETABIX KIDS WEAR DOC MARTEN BOOTS AND BRACES 
AND ARE A PRETTY ROUGH LOT 
WEETABIX 
IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU 
O. K. 
MOST BRANDS FORSOOK MOTHERLY WARMTH FOR ATHLETIC DYNAMISM 
STREET SURVIVAL IT SEEMED 
WAS CLOSE TO THE HEART OF THE EIGHTIES' CHILD 
WHEN I GROW UP I WANNA BE STRONG 
BUT CHILDREN STILL APPEARED TO KNOW WHAT WAS REALLY GOOD FOR THEM 
PROTEIN PARDON 
BEEF'S A VALUABLE SOURCE OF PROTEIN 
FLORA MARGARINE 
WHY DIDN'T SHE JUST PUT MARG POLY WHASSERNAMES 
YOUR CHILD IS TELLING YOU WHAT YOU SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T BUY 
WITH NUTRITIONAL AS WELL AS FUN MESSAGES 
NO ARTIFICIAL COLOURS 
CHILDREN MAY EVEN INFLUENCE THE TYPE OF CAR YOU BUY 
DOES JOHNNY WANT TO COME IN UNCLE TOM'S NOVA 
IN THE OLD DAYS THERE ALWAYS WAS A CLEARLY DEFINED POINT AT WHICH YOU CEASED BEING A KID 
IN BRAND MARKETING NOWADAYS KIDS ARE TEENAGERS AT THE AGE OF SIX OR SEVEN 
THE CHILD AND SLASH OR TEENAGER IS A PROFESSIONAL CONSUMER 
AND THE SAME HABITS OF CONSUMPTION WHICH ARE BEING INCULCATED INTO CHILDREN AT AN EARLY AGE 
ARE MANIFESTING THEMSELVES AS THEY REACH TEENAGERDOM 
SO THE TECHNIQUES ARE BEING LEARNT MUCH YOUNGER 
UNLIKE THE FIFTIES WHEN CHILDREN WERE INNOCENT 
MONEY BY THE FLYING LIZARDS 
THE TEENAGERS OF THE EIGHTIES CAME TO BE KNOWN AS NEW WAVE 
I WANT MONEY 
THAT'S WHAT I WANT 
THESE SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLDS HAD NO DOUBTS ABOUT WHAT THEY WANTED 
HALIFAX SPELT OUT WITH EMBARRASSING FRANKNESS THE ASPIRATIONS OF A NEW GENERATION 
YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE THE FANTASIES THE DREAMS 
THEY'RE ACTUALLY QUICK TO CONFORM REACTIONARY AND TRADITIONAL 
THEY'RE GOVERNED BY MARKET FORCES WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE PERVADING PHILOSOPHY OF THATCHER'S BRITAIN 
THIS NEW CONFORMITY IS EVIDENT IN BANK COMMERCIALS 
FAST CUT IMAGES ARE DEPLOYED TO LURE THE NEW WAVE INTO BANK ACCOUNTS AND DEBT 
THEY ARE OFTEN SEEN PULLING OFF DEALS 
I'D LIKE A CHEQUEBOOK WHEN I START WORK REALLY RIGHT 
DID WE GET IT YEAH AND THAT'S NOT ALL 
YOU GET THE CONTRACT FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CONGRATULATIONS MARK 
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT BESETS NEW WAVE YOUNG 
IS THAT THEY ARE BEING TRAINED TO CONSUME AS MIDDLE AGED PEOPLE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR ARE EXPECTED TO CONSUME LIKE PEOPLE OFTEN TEN YEARS OLDER 
AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY 
PEOPLE ARE ENCOURAGED TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITIES AT A YOUNGER AGE 
FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES WERE NOT THE ONLY BURDEN OF THIS GENERATION 
HEROIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THIS FUSS IS ABOUT I CAN HANDLE IT 
BUT VICTIMS OF BLEAK URBAN SETTINGS WEREN'T CONFINED TO HEALTH WARNINGS 
NEW WAVE ADVERTISING HAS DRAWN REPEATEDLY FROM METROPOLIS LIKE IMAGES OF A MACHINE AGE NIGHTMARE 
I NEED A PERSONAL TRANSPORTER I MUST TELL YOU 
IS THERE NOBODY I CAN TALK TO ABOUT AN OVERDRAFT 
THE CHALLENGE TO THE YOUNG WAS NOT TO GO UNDER 
SEIKO PERFORMS THE REST IS UP TO YOU 
BUT IF THE PRESSURES OF THE PRESENT PROVE TOO MUCH TO BEAR 
REASSURANCE CAME IN THE FORM OF A NOSTALGIC TEENAGE PAST 
I HEARD IT THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE BY MARVIN GAYE 
I THINK IT'S BEEN VERY INTERESTING 
THAT YOU'VE HAD A LOT OF FIFTIES IMAGERY THROUGHOUT ADVERTISING DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS 
WHAT IT'S SELLING TO NEW WAVE YOUTH 
IS A TIME WHEN TEENAGERS FIRST HAD PURCHASING POWER 
WHEN THEY WERE FREE TO ACTUALLY BE THEMSELVES 
AS OPPOSED TO BEING YOUNG ADULTS AS THEY'RE EXPECTED TO BE NOW 
I'LL BE SEEING YOU AROUND O. K. 
THEY'VE SANITISED THE FIFTIES' IMAGES 
WHAT THEY WANT IS THE STYLE THE HAIRDOS THE CLOTHES 
WITHOUT REALLY WANTING TO CONNECT WITH BEING A TEENAGER AND HAVING TO ASSESS THE WORLD YOU'RE IN 
BUT ON THE EVE OF THE NINETIES 
THERE WERE FAINT SIGNS OF NEW LESS MATERIALISTIC TEENAGE VALUES 
I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW THE RAIN HAS GONE 
I CAN SEE ALL OBSTACLES IN MY WAY 
GONE ARE D. A. ARK CLOUDS THAT HAD ME BLIND 
THERE'S A NEW TREND BEGINNING TO EMERGE 
IT'S JUST BEGINNING NOW TO SHOW 
THAT THERE IS SOMETHING MORE THAN MERE MECHANISTIC CONTROL 
OR MERE MAN AS MACHINE OR MERE URBAN DECAY 
THE PEPE RAINDANCE COMMERCIAL IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS 
TWO KIDS ARE IN A DULL ENVIRONMENT 
BUT IN PARALLEL THERE'S THIS INDIAN RAINDANCE GOING ON 
IT'S SOMETHING EXOTIC ROMANTIC 
THAT THEY CAN RECOGNISE AND UNDERSTAND 
THAT THE BRAND CAN BRING TO THEM 
IT'S A VERY INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT 
THAT PERHAPS THERE IS HOPE 
THAT PERHAPS THERE IS MORE TO LIFE THAN JUST WHAT'S ON THE SURFACE 
BUT THE PEPE TEENAGERS' IDEALISM 
IS WORLDS APART FROM THEIR GENERATION 
IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE A GENERATION OF GROCERS' CHILDREN FROM GRANTHAM 
THE CHALLENGE OF THE NINETIES WILL BE TO SEE IF THAT DOES CHANGE 
THERE WAS TALK ABOUT ACID HOUSE AND WAS THIS THE BEGINNING OF A YOUNG PEOPLE'S REBELLION 
BUT I THINK THERE IS SUCH A GREAT COMMITMENT NOW TO CONSUMER VALUES 
THAT I CAN'T SEE IT CHANGING 
THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE ARE FREE 
BUT YOU CAN GIVE THEM TO THE BIRDS AND BEES 
I WANT MONEY THAT'S WHAT I WANT 
THAT'S WHAT I WANT 
THAT'S WHAT I WANT 
NOW COME ON LET'S DO IT 
THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS ARE OUT OF RETIREMENT 
YOU'RE MAURICE RILEY YOU'RE SYD WOOLSEY 
YOU'RE THE INVISIBLES 
ARGH 
THERE ISN'T A CAR I CAN'T DRIVE OR AN ALARM I CAN'T SILENCE 
OH OH 
THAT'S WHERE ALL THE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE COME FROM MAURICE 
YOU'VE GOT SKILLS THAT THE KIDS TODAY THEY JUST HAVEN'T GOT 
WE'VE GOT A BIT OF A HITCH 
ALL RIGHT KEEP YOUR HAIR ON 
YOU TWO ARE MY GUIDING LIGHT 
DO THE CHECKS IN THIS JACKET MAKE ME LOOK CHUNKY 
HI HON NO IT'S FINE 
ME AND MAURICE ARE JUST HAVING A BIT OF A JOG 
CATCH THEM IF YOU CAN
