GOOD MORNING THIS IS STELLA CARSON AND YOU'RE LISTENING TO HEADLINES 
TODAY'S SUBJECT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MODERN POLICING METHODS 
DO CURRENT POLICE POWERS GO TOO FAR 
OR NOT FAR ENOUGH 
JOINING ME IN THE STUDIO ARE DETECTIVE INSPECTOR EVA MOORE FROM LETHERBRIDGE POLICE STATION 
HELLO 
AND RONNIE WOODSON A LOCAL SOLICITOR 
GOOD MORNING 
DI MOORE IF I COULD START WITH YOU 
AS A WOMAN DO YOU FEEL YOU HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON THE MODERN POLICE FORCE 
I DON'T FEEL I'M TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY TO MY MALE COLLEAGUES 
YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S NO GLASS CEILING FOR OUR GIRLS IN BLUE 
THAT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE 
MOST PROFESSIONS HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE BENEFITS OF SENSITIVITY TRAINING FOR A WHILE 
OH SORRY TOO LOUD 
NO NO THAT'S RONNIE WOODSON IS THAT THE STELLA CARSON SHOW 
YEAH HE'S ON IT WITH A POLICEWOMAN 
IT'S GREAT THE WAY SHE RIPS INTO PEOPLE IF THEY TRY AND GET TOO CLEVER 
SHE'LL HAVE HER WORK CUT OUT WITH RONNIE 
COOL SHOULD BE GOOD THEN 
O. K. WE'VE TOUCHED ON SENSITIVITY TRAINING 
LET'S TURN TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS BILL 
OBSTACLE TO POLICE WORK OR WELCOME ADDITION TO BOTH YOUR PROFESSIONS 
GOOD THING ABSOLUTELY DI MOORE ON THE WHOLE GOOD 
HAS IT CHANGED YOUR APPROACH 
LESS EASY TO BEAR DOWN ON DO YOU MEAN 
WITH RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES GIVEN THEIR PROPER RESPECT 
BUT WE'VE MET THE CHALLENGE WHICH IS 
TO TREAT EVERYONE EQUALLY IN EVERY INQUIRY EQUALLY 
YOU DISAGREE 
IS IT EQUALITY OR IS IT UNIFORMITY 
DO YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE 
INCREASED CALLS FROM SOME OF DI MOORE'S SUPERIORS FOR A NATIONAL D. N. A. DATABASE SPRINGS TO MIND 
THAT'S A MEDIA FUELLED PIPE DREAM 
IS IT YOU'D HAVE THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION CONVENIENTLY CATALOGUED FOR YOU 
CATALOGUE MAKES IT SOUND LIKE THE COPS COULD JUST POP TO ARGOS FOR A SUSPECT 
DON'T LAUGH 
IT TAKES HARD WORK AND TRAINING TO BE A GOOD SOLICITOR 
OH HERE WE GO ACTUALLY HE'S RIGHT AND RONNIE IS A GOOD SOLICITOR 
DO YOU THINK YOUR FRIEND COULD SPEAK WITH MY SON 
HE COULD USE SOME GUIDANCE 
OR A GUIDE DOG LEAD HIM TO HIS PAINTBRUSH BEFORE HIS CUP OF TEA IN THE MORNING 
YOU'RE JUST THE EMPLOYEE WHO'S MORE QUALIFIED THAN YOU MISSED A BIT 
EXCUSE ME COULD WE DO LESS TALKING MORE WORKING PLEASE 
WELL YEAH I SUPPOSE I COULD SPEAK TO RONNIE FOR YOU YES WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED 
OR ONE OF YOUR G. P. FRIENDS EVEN 
HE HAS THE MAKINGS DAD 
I DON'T WANT TO BE A DOCTOR LOOK AT YOUR A LEVEL RESULTS 
I DIDN'T WORK HARD SO YOU COULD PAINT THE OFFICES OF SOLICITORS AND G. P.'S INSTEAD OF BEING ONE YOURSELF 
SO IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU I DIDN'T HAVE YOUR BRAINS OR OPPORTUNITIES 
HAVE SOME AMBITION 
I DO TO RUN THE FAMILY BUSINESS 
YOU'RE GOING TO UNIVERSITY IN OCTOBER END OF DISCUSSION 
WELL I GUESS BEING BOSS SOMETIMES INVOLVES MAKING UNPOPULAR DECISIONS 
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE RELYING ON PEOPLE TO GET A JOB DONE FOR YOU 
IF WE COULD STAY ON D. N. A. EVIDENCE THERE'S A LOCAL CASE 
THAT'S ENJOYING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PRESS NOTORIETY AT THE MOMENT 
OH DO YOU MEAN THE BURGLAR WHO LEAVES A HOW CAN WE PUT IT A CALLING CARD AT THE SCENE 
YOU MEAN HE URINATES IN THE HOMEOWNER'S TEAPOT OR COFFEE POT 
THE LOCAL PAPERS HAVE DUBBED HIM JACK THE DRIPPER 
BY CALLING HIM THAT ALL THE MEDIA DO 
IS TRIVIALISE WHAT'S IN FACT A DEEPLY UNPLEASANT AND OFFENSIVE CRIME 
ARE YOU INVOLVED IN THE CASE 
WE'RE FOLLOWING SEVERAL LINES OF INQUIRY 
MR. WOODSON WOULD YOU NOT SAY THIS IS ONE INSTANCE WHERE A D. N. A. DATABASE MIGHT ENSURE A SPEEDY RESOLUTION 
WITH OVER FOUR MILLION PROFILES ALREADY ON THE EXISTING ONE 
THERE'S A CHANCE THE POLICE MIGHT FIND A MATCH 
BUT NO I'M NOT CONVINCED IT'S THE ANSWER 
OH COME ON EVEN THOUGH IT COULD SAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THE MISERY OF BEING VISITED BY THIS CRIMINAL 
THE BURGLAR'S HUMAN RIGHTS COULD BE VIOLATED AND THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT 
IT'S THE ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AS A WHOLE THAT'S AT STAKE 
PITY THE POOR HOMEOWNER TRAPPED BETWEEN THE PAIR OF YOU 
ONE PERSON LEAVING URINE AND YOU SAT HERE TAKING IT 
OH COME ON RONNIE PUT THE BOOT IN 
YOU WERE CRITISING THE PRESS FOR TRIVIALISING THESE BURGLARIES NOW YOU'RE DOING THE SAME 
I'M NOT THE ONE DISMISSING THE RIGHTS OF THE VICTIMS 
FROM A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW 
IS URINE A VALID PIECE OF EVIDENCE AS VALID AS SAY BLOOD OR SALIVA 
AND IS THIS THE ONLY CLUE YOU HAVE 
I'D RATHER NOT COMMENT ON AN ACTIVE CASE 
RATHER NOT COMMENT OR WON'T 
WHAT CAN THE POLICE DO TO STOP SUCH A DISGUSTING MAN IN HIS TRACKS 
BACK AFTER THIS 
IS SOMETHING WRONG 
NO JUST LISTENING TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING ABOUT THIS BURGLAR AND WHAT HE DOES TO TEAPOTS 
THEY'RE ANIMALS THESE PEOPLE 
IT'S TERRIBLE ISN'T IT I READ ABOUT HIM 
SO HOW'S IT GOING 
FINE FINE 
AND YET YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE HERE 
WELL TERRY'S GONE TO THE VAN TO GET SOME ROLLERS AND RAM WANTS THE SMALL STEP SO HE CAN DO THE CORNERS 
RIGHT 
I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO SEE THAT ARGUMENT EARLIER 
IT'S JUST THAT RAM'S WELL LACK OF AMBITION DRIVES US UP THE WALL 
YOU THINK YOUR JOB IS UNIMPORTANT 
NO NO BUT IT'S JUST THAT HELPING ME WAS ONLY MEANT TO BE A STOPGAP 
HE'S GOOD BUT IT WAS A WAY OF HIM SAVING FOR UNIVERSITY 
THAT'S WHY I EMPLOYED TERRY 
BUT IF RAM'S GOOD AT IT 
TERRY'S QUALIFIED CITY AND AMP GUILDS 
HE'S A PLASTERER AND HE WORKS ONE DAY A WEEK AT THE COLLEGE TRAINING TO BE AN ELECTRICIAN TOO 
WELL THEY DON'T SEEM TO GET ON TERRY'S VERY VERY PROFESSIONAL 
REALLY REALLY 
I TRY TO GIVE THEM SEPARATE JOBS SO THEY DON'T GET UNDER EACH OTHER'S FEET 
LIKE NOT PLAYING FAVOURITES 
EXACTLY AND THAT'S A MOTHER'S LOGIC 
YOU MUST KNOW WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY THAT I WANT BETTER FOR MY SON THAN I HAD FOR MYSELF 
IT'S WHAT ALL PARENTS WANT 
WHAT THIS PARENT WANTS IS TO KNOW THAT THIS PLACE WILL BE READY 
WHAT NOW OH FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE 
YOU DON'T NEED THAT LADDER TILL THE CEILING'S DONE THERE'S NO POINT PAINTING UP THAT HIGH 
I CAN'T STOP MIDWAY THERE'S A TIDE LINE YOU'RE THE EXPERT 
EXPERT AT KNOWING AN AMATEUR YEAH YOU'RE A LIGHTWEIGHT 
ONE WORD FROM ME AND DAD 
THINK HE'LL TAKE ANY NOTICE OF YOU 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE 
GET OUT MY WAY OR USE YOUR TRAINING TO GET THAT STEP LADDER 
I'M TRYING TO GET THE JOB DONE QUICKLY AND RIGHT 
NOW SEE WE PUT PAINT ON THE WALLS NOT THE CLIENT 
MS. PARSONS I'M SO SORRY NO 
NO 
I JUST DO THE JOB 
I CAN'T APOLOGISE ENOUGH IT WILL WASH OUT EASILY IT'S WATER BASED 
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU TWO WHY THIS CHILDISH RIVALRY ALL THE TIME 
HE TRIES TO MAKE ME FEEL I TAKE SECOND PLACE 
ONCE AND FOR ALL TERRY WILL BE WITH ME FULL TIME WHEN HE FINISHES COLLEG 
AND WHEN YOU LEAVE DAD I WAS JUST TRYING TO 
AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO WRECK THAT SO COOL OFF 
OUR NEXT E. MAIL IS FROM 
OH NOW I KNOW DI MOORE WANTED TO MOVE ON FROM THIS TOPIC 
BUT WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM ONE OF JACK THE DRIPPER'S VICTIMS 
REALLY 
HIS LATEST 
THE ONE JACK HOSPITALISED IN FACT 
SHE FOUND HIM AND HE TURNED ON HER IS SHE O. K. 
SHE'S OUT OF HOSPITAL NOW AND SHE'S MAKING GOOD PROGRESS 
SHE MUST BE YOUR STAR WITNESS 
SHE'S A VULNERABLE WOMAN WHO NEEDS SUPPORT 
AND SHE HAS A QUESTION FOR MR. WOODSON 
WOULD YOU DEFEND HER ATTACKER IN COURT IF ASKED 
IF I WAS APPROACHED I'D LOOK AT ALL THE EVIDENCE 
BUT YOU HAVE TO PUT ASIDE OH GO ON RONNIE BITE HER ON THE A. 
AH HELLO 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ON PLOD PATROL TODAY 
JUST DROPPING OFF SOME TIMESHEETS DID YOU KNOW EVA WAS GOING TO BE RONNIE'S OPPONENT ON THAT SHOW 
IT WAS PRETTY LAST MINUTE HOW'S IT GOING 
THAT HARPY'S TRYING TO TRIP THEM UP 
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE JACK THE DRIPPER CASE SHE'S TAUNTING THEM WITH 
ONLY THAT HIS LAST VICTIM CAUGHT HIM IN THE ACT AND HE GAVE HER A FRACTURED SKULL 
OH 
ALL RIGHT 
THE SMELL OF PAINT WAS GETTING TO ME 
THERE'S AN ATMOSPHERE TOO 
JULIA'S FURIOUS ABOUT THE LACK OF PROGRESS 
AND GETTING SPLATTERED NEW SHOES 
YEP IN THE DOGHOUSE FOR THAT 
YOUR DAD'S MUTTERING UNDER HIS BREATH IN URDU 
WAIT TILL I TELL HIM I'M NOT GOING TO UNI WHY 
HE JUST WANTS ME TO BE SOMETHING I'M NOT 
HE WANTS YOU TO DO WELL I'M SURE YEAH BUT I'M DOING THAT 
I'M GETTING ON WITH MY LIFE AND I'VE GOT ALL MY MATES HERE WHY CHANGE ALL THAT 
PERSONALLY SPEAKING I'M HAPPY FOR THE CHANGES GOING ON 
WHAT REPAINTING THE SURGERY 
JULIA'S DOING MORE THAN THAT 
I'M LEARNING ALL THE TIME 
AND I KNOW IT'S GOING TO GIVE ME MORE CHANCES IN THE LONG RUN BETTER ONES 
WELL I'M O. K. AS I AM 
I JUST NEED TO PROVE THAT I'M INDISPENSABLE TO THIS BUSINESS THEN DAD'LL SEE 
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS YOU WOULDN'T RULE OUT REPRESENTING THIS VIOLENT PREDATORY MAN 
WOULDN'T IT PRICK YOUR CONSCIENCE JUST A LITTLE 
EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL 
I THINK A LOT OF OUR LISTENERS MIGHT SAY HE DESERVES NO RIGHTS AT ALL 
THAT'S NOT HOW A CIVILISED SOCIETY WORKS IS IT ISN'T IT 
EVERYONE MUST HAVE ACCESS TO LEGAL COUNSEL 
REALLY YOU SOUND SURPRISED 
GIVEN WHAT YOU'VE SAID SO FAR 
I BELIEVE IN STRONG EFFECTIVE POLICING TO KEEP ORDER 
NOT A POLICE STATE SOME MIGHT ARGUE WE'VE ALREADY GOT THAT 
AND SOME WOULD LIKE FAR MORE SWEEPING POWERS FOR US THAN THAT 
THE RIGHT TO ENTER ANY PREMISES WITHOUT A SEARCH WARRANT FOR EXAMPLE 
YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE WRONG I THINK IT'D BE EXPLOITED AND ABUSED OUR HOMES WOULDN'T BE SAFE 
OUR OWN HOUSES AREN'T SAFE WHERE JACK THE DRIPPER'S CONCERNED 
IF YOU KNEW HE WAS LISTENING RIGHT NOW WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO HIM 
COME ON POSTER GIRL TELL HIM YOU'LL HAVE HIS DANGLY BITS FOR EARRINGS WHEN YOU CATCH HIM 
I'D TELL HIM TO GIVE HIMSELF UP 
OH SORRY SIR 
HOW CAN I HELP 
THAT'S IT 
YOU'D TELL HIM TO GIVE HIMSELF UP 
I'D WANT HIM TO UNDERSTAND THE DISTRESS HE CAUSES 
THE VIOLATION HIS VICTIMS FEEL AT HIS BREAKING IN 
AND IF HE FEELS COMPELLED CAN'T STOP HIMSELF WE CAN GET HIM HELP 
IS THIS YOUR STRONG POLICING AT WORK 
DO WE HAVE TWO BLEEDING HEARTS IN THE STUDIO 
DID YOU EXPECT DI MOORE TO START ISSUING THREATS 
SHE MIGHT TAKE A HARDER LINE 
SHE'S STILL GOT TO WORK WITHIN THE LAW JUST BECAUSE SHE'S ENFORCING IT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S ABOVE IT 
I'M A POLICE OFFICER NOT A VIGILANTE 
IT'S UP TO US TO ENSURE THE SYSTEM IS KEPT FAIR 
THAT'S NOT HOW IT SEEMED AT THE START 
WE WORK HARD TO MAKE IT WORK 
POLICING SHOULD BE EFFECTIVE NOT 
TOTALITARIAN 
RIGHT WE MIGHT FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL 
BUT ONE OF YOU ULTIMATELY HAS TO BE WRONG IF YOU'RE OPPOSING EACH OTHER IN A CASE 
WHAT DO YOU TAKE TURNS 
THAT'S ABSURD 
DI MOORE IS AGGRESSIVE BUT SHE'S NEVER CROSSED A LINE WELL SHE MIGHT HAVE CHEWED ON IT 
IS THIS ALL AN ACT THEN WHAT WE'VE HEARD 
IS THERE MORE MUTUAL RESPECT THAN YOUR FIGHTING SUGGESTS 
I RESPECT HIS PROFESSIONALISM 
LIKEWISE SO FOR ALL YOUR CROSSED SWORDS ARE WE TO ASSUME YOU'RE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN 
IS THIS THE FREEMASONS AT WORK OR MUTUAL BACK SCRATCHING 
WE'LL BE BACK TO HEAR THE ANSWER SHORTLY 
M. M. M. IT'S SO MUCH BRIGHTER IN HERE ALREADY 
YEAH MATCHES MY TROUSERS 
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT 
BEING FOISTED OFF WITH THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS AN ACCIDENT AND I THINK I'M STUCK WITH THEM 
I'VE RUNG ROUND BUT NO LUCK 
O. I. 
SORRY ACCIDENT WHAT FROM OVER THERE 
YOU MUST'VE THROWN IT LIKE THIS 
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS RAM GET OUT 
BUT HE STARTED IT YOU'RE NO USE TO ANYONE I'M FINISHING IT 
NOW YOU LISTEN UP THIS PLACE HAS GOT TO BE READY WE OPEN ON TUESDAY 
IF IT IS NOT PAINTED AND FINISHED I WILL DOCK YOUR WAGES FOR EVERY DAY THAT YOU DELAY MY OPENING 
AND I WILL TELL THE UNIVERSITY HOW UNRELIABLE YOU HAVE BEEN 
WE'RE ON CONTRACT YOU CAN KISS THAT GOODBYE BY THE TIME I'VE FINISHED WITH YOU 
THAT'S GREAT JUST WALK OUT WHY DON'T YOU 
THAT'S GONNA GET THE JOB DONE 
DON'T WORRY BOSS I CAN CARRY THIS 
I CAN'T HAVE YOU WORKING WITH US IT'S TOO ANTAGONISTIC 
CALL THIS YOUR LAST DAY 
YOU'RE FIRING ME TAKE SUMMER OFF 
GO TRAVELLING VISIT FAMILY WHATEVER 
LET TERRY SETTLE IN I'M NOT GOING TO UNI 
YOU ARE I'M HAPPY THE WAY THINGS ARE WHY BE A SOLICITOR 
I AGREE BUT THERE'S NO POINT IN STAYING HERE EITHER 
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY WORK DONE UNTIL THIS IS SETTLED 
MS. PARSONS PLEASE 
IF YOU DID GO TO UNI WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO STUDY 
PSYCHOLOGY OR ENGLISH LIT 
AND WHAT GOOD WOULD THAT BE YOU'D BE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE 
AT LEAST GIVE HIM THE SPACE TO FIND OUT HIMSELF 
AND LEARN FROM HIS CHOICES GOOD OR BAD ISN'T THAT WHAT WE DO IF WE'RE GOOD PARENTS 
GIVE THEM SPACE FIRST YOU WANT TO WORK WITH ME THEN YOU WANT YOUR SPACE 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT I KNOW WHAT I WANT AND I WON'T GET IT UNTIL THIS IS SORTED OUT 
BUT PSYCHOLOGY DAD IF IT'S A NON STARTER I'LL COME BACK AND WORK WITH YOU 
I'LL GIVE UNI A TRY BUT ON THOSE TERMS 
AM I GOING TO HAVE TO WATCH YOU LIKE A HAWK TILL THEN 
I'D RATHER YOU WATCH PAINT DRY TODAY PREFERABLY 
WE'VE ANOTHER E. MAIL 
THIS ONE ASKS DOES YOUR WORK AFFECT YOUR PERSONAL LIVES 
DOES IT EVER GET YOU DOWN SEEING THE WORST OF HUMANITY ON A DAILY BASIS 
DI MOORE 
IT'S NOT A NINE TO FIVE JOB IT HAS ITS PRESSURES 
IT'S HARD NOT TO TAKE YOUR WORK HOME WITH YOU SOMETIMES 
AND CAN THAT AFFECT YOUR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS 
I HAVE A VERY TOLERANT AND UNDERSTANDING PARTNER 
YOU DO SEE A LOT OF CASUALTIES ON THE DOMESTIC FRONT IN THE FORCE 
IT CAN BE DIFFICULT 
DI MOORE MR. WOODSON FOR THE MOMENT THANK YOU 
COMING UP THE LOCAL NEWS AND WEATHER YOU O. K. 
YEAH FINE I'VE GOT TO VISIT JACK THE DRIPPER'S LATEST VICTIM AFTER THIS GIVE HER SOME GOOD NEWS 
YOU'VE NOT CAUGHT HIM HAVE YOU NO BUT HE'S GOT A NASTY SURPRISE COMING TO HIM 
HOW'S THAT 
FORENSICS HAVE TESTED HIS LATEST URINE SAMPLE AND FOUND BLOOD 
WHICH MEANS HE COULD HAVE SOMETHING VERY NASTY 
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT CHEER HER UP TO KNOW THAT 
IT LOOKS LIKE KARMA COULD BE AT WORK WITH US ON THIS ONE 
I SHOULD POINT OUT WE'RE STILL ON AIR 
REALLY OH NO 
BOLL 
WE'RE OFF AIR NOW 
DO I LOOK LIKE I CARE YOU DIDN'T DO IT DELIBERATELY DID YOU 
OFFICIALLY NO BUT OFF THE RECORD IT'S GONE ON LONG ENOUGH 
I HOPE HIS VICTIMS HEARD AND GET PLEASURE FROM KNOWING HE'LL SUFFER WHATEVER HAPPENS 
YOU MIGHT HAVE JEOPARDISED ANY CASE YOU COULD BRING AGAINST HIM WHEN HE'S CAUGHT 
I'LL WORRY ABOUT THAT WHEN IT HAPPENS 
FORENSICS THINK THAT THE BLOOD COULD BE A KIDNEY PROBLEM NICE IRONY
