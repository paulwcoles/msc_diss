THE BEIJING GAMES 
ALSO WE HEAR FROM THE FORMER DEPUTY 
ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER TO THE 
METROPOLITAN POLICE HE IS A LONDON 
MAYORAL CANDIDATE BRIAN PADDICK 
WE WILL FIND OUT WHY HE HE WANTS TO 
RUN THE CAPITAL 
AND JUST WHEN POLITICIANS THOUGHT 
THEY WERE SAFE A NAUGHTIES 
VERSION OF SPITTING IMAGE ARRIVES 
ON OUR SCREENS WILL POLITICIANS 
BE SPITTING BLOOD 
IT IS BAD NEWS 
IT IS NOT MY FAULT THEY REALLY 
DON'T LIKE YOU AND IT IS NOT MY 
FAULT WE'RE DOOMED DOOMED DOOMED 
DARLING WHAT HAPPENED 
YOU CAME 
BOTTOM HEAT MAGAZINE'S WHAT'S 
COOL SURVEY 
VERY FUNNY 
WE CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THAT THAT'S 
OUR WEEKEND SOWN UP 
ALL THAT IS COMING UP WITH US FOR 
THE DURATION FORMER POLICE OFFICER 
NOW THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE 
FOR LONDON MAYOR BRIAN PADDICK 
WELCOME BACK TO THE DAILY POLITICS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO YOU IN A 
MINUTE THIS THIS TOP STORY THE 
B. B. C. UNDERSTANDS THAT THE OFFICIAL 
BODY WHICH ADVISES THE GOVERNMENT 
ON DRUGS POLICY DECIDED THAT 
CANNABIS SHOULD REMAIN CLASS C. DRUG IN 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR THE 
GOVERNMENT 
DOWNGRADED CANNABIS FROM THE MOST 
SERIOUS CLASS B. DRUG TO CLASS C. 
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AFTER REVIEW OF THAT 
POLICY BY WHAT IS CALLED THE 
ADVISORY COUNCIL ON THE MISUSE OF 
DRUGS CHARLES CLARKE HE WAS THE 
HOME SECRETARY ANNOUNCED IT WOULD 
REMAIN CLASS C. DRUG 
LAST JULY WHEN GORDON BROWN TOOK 
OVER AS PRIME MINISTER HE ASKED 
THE ADVISORY COUNCIL ON THE MISUSE 
OF DRUGS TO CARRY OUT ANOTHER 
REVIEW AS MR. BROWN BROWN IS PRONE 
TO DO WITH REVIEWS HE MADE HIS OWN 
VIEWS CLEAR ON THE ISSUE EARLIER 
THIS WEEK AT HIS MONTHLY PRESS 
CONFERENCE CONFERENCE I BELIEVE IT WAS SENDING OUT A 
SIGNAL PARTICULARLY TO TEENAGERS 
AND IN PARTICULAR THOSE AT THE MOST 
VULNERABLE AGE YOUNG TEENAGERS IN 
ANY WE FIND CANNABIS ACCEPTABLE 
GIVEN ALL WE NOW KNOW ABOUT THE 
CHANGE IN THE WAY THAT CANNABIS HAS 
BEEN SOLD IN THIS THAT THAT 
IS NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO 
BRIAN PADDICK WHEN YOU WERE THE 
TOP COPPER IN LAMBETH YOU HAD THE 
SOFTLY SOFTLY APPROACH TO CANNABIS 
USE DID YOU SUPPORT THE 
RECLASSIFICATION FROM THE MORE 
SERIOUS CLASS B. TO THE LESS SERIOUS 
CLASS C. 
NO I GAVE EVIDENCE TO THE TO THE 
TO THE HOME AFFAIRS SELECT 
COMMITTEE AND I SAID IT WOULD BE 
SENDING THE WRONG MESSAGE TO YOUNG 
YOUNG PEOPLE AND I DIDN'T SEE IT 
WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO 
YOU HAD YOUR WAY THEN YOU WOULD 
HAVE KEPT IT AT THE CLASS B. YES 
ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY WHAUNG SHOULD HAPPEN NOW 
I THINK 
WE WE SHOULD STOP POLITICAL 
POSTURING ABOUT WHETHER IT IS CLOOS 
B. OR CLASS C. LET'S SEND A STRONG 
MESSAGE AND LET'S GET THAT MESSAGE 
INTO SCHOOLS AND SPEND OUR TIME AND 
ENERGY AND EFFORT INTO EDUCATING 
OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT THE HARMFUL 
EFFECTS OF CANNABIS AND LET'S NOT 
WORRY WHAT CLASS IT IS IN HOW MANY 
YOUNG PEOPLE I WONDER WHEN THEY 
DECIDE THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE 
CANNABIS OR NOT WHAT CLASS IT IS 
IN IN IS IT A SERIOUS DRUG ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY THE STRONGER FORM OF CANNABIS THE 
SKUNK CAN CAUSE SCHIZOPHRENIA IN 
PEOPLE EVEN THE WEAKER FORM IF 
YOU CONSUME TOO MUCH OF IT IT CAN 
LEAD TO PARANOIA AND OTHER MENTAL 
ILLNESS IT IS A DANGEROUS DRUG AND 
THAT'S THE MESSAGE WE SHOULD BE 
GETTING ACROSS 
GIVEN HOW DANGEROUS THAT IS AND IT 
HAS BECOME MORE DANGEROUS IN RECENT 
YEARS ABSOLUTELY YEARS ABSOLUTELY THE MEDIA TYPES WHO CAME TO 
UNIVERSITY IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES THINK 
IT IS THE SAME STUFF THEY SMOKED 
WHY WOULDN'T YOU RECLASSIFY IT IT 
IT B. 
I DON'T THINK YOUNG PEOPLE 
PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THE CLASS 
ECSTASY THAT'S CLASS A IT DOESN'T 
STOP YOUNG PEOPLE TAKING IT WHAT 
WILL STOP YOUNG PEOPLE PEOPLE 
TAKING DRUGS IS GETTING PEOPLE WITH 
CREDIBILITY INTO SCHOOLS AND SAYING 
DON'T TAKE THESE DRUGS BECAUSE IT 
WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE 
WE HAVE LOTS 
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY 
MOVING ON TO OUR QUIZ TO TEST HOW 
MUCH YOU KNOW ABOUT OUR GUEST TODAY 
AND THE QUESTION IS 
TO ENTER GO TO OUR WEBSITE AND 
CLICK ON THE QUIZ AND AT THE END 
BRIAN PADDICK WILL GIVE US THE 
CORRECT ANSWER 
IF YOU WANT TO SEND US YOUR 
COMMENTS GET E. MAILING TO US AT 
I LIKE THE IDEA OF C. S. I. LAMBETH 
I FEEL A NEW T. V. SERIES COMING ON 
THE PBB WE'RE DOING IT IS C. S. I. 
LAMBETH LAMBETH THERE IS A THREAD 
THAT NEED NOT BE THE NAME OF HIS 
BOOK BOOK WE MOVE ON TO CHINA THE OLYMPIC 
TORCH ARRIVES IN LONDON THIS 
WEEKEND HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGNERS 
ARE GEARING UP TO PUSH THE CASE FOR 
REFORM AS BEIJING PREPARES TO HOST 
THE GAMES THERE ARE GOING TO BE A 
NUMBER OF PROTEST WHEN THE TORCH 
DOES ARRIVE IN LONDON AND THE 
CHINESE AMBASSADOR SHE WAS GOING 
TO BE PART OF THE TEAM CARRYING 
THIS TORCH THROUGH THE CITY BUT AS 
WE WERE COMING ON AIR WE LEARN 
THAT BECAUSE OF THE THREAT OF OF 
ANTI CHINA PROTESTS PLANNED ON 
SUNDAY THE CHINESE EMBASSY IS 
TELLING US THE AMBASSADOR HAS BEEN 
ASKED TO SPEND THE DAY WITH THE 
OFFICIAL BEIJING DELEGATION AT A 
LONDON HOTEL 
NOW THE OLYMPICS IN CHINA PROVOKED 
LOTS OF CONTROVERSY ALREADY THE 
FILM DIRECTOR STEVEN SPIELBERG 
RESIGNED OVER CHINA'S POLICY OVER 
DARFUR AND THERE ARE CALLS FOR 
POLITICAL LEADERS TO BOYCOTT THE 
OLYMPICS THE GERMAN LEADER SAYS 
SHE WON'T GO TO THE OPENING 
CEREMONY MR. SARKOZY IS HINTING HE 
MIGHT NOT GO 
IT IS CONTROVERSIAL AND HERE 
CHINESE STUDENTS ARE AWAITING THE 
TORCH'S ARRIVAL IN LONDON THIS 
WEEKEND WEEKEND SOME OF THEM ARE PREPARING TO RUN 
ALONGSIDE IT IN A GUESTURE OF 
SOLIDARITY TO PROTECT IT FROM 
DEMONSTRATORS A COLLECTION OF AND 
THE ATHLETES AND SHOWBIZ 
PERSONALITIES WILL CARRY THE TORCH 
IT IS LIKELY TO ATTRACT THE 
ATTENTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
CAMPAIGNERS CAMPAIGNERS THESE WERE THE SCENES LAST MONTH IN 
GREECE AS PROTESTERS DISRUPTED THE 
LIGHTING OF THE OLYMPIC TORCH 
CHINA'S HOSTING THE GAMES HAS 
THROWN THE SPOTLIGHT ON THE 
COUNTRY'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD WITH 
VIOLENCE OVER THE STATUS OF TIBET 
BRINGING THE ISSUE TO THE ATTENTION 
OF THE WORLD 
WHILE THE OLYMPIC TORCH EYE RIVES 
IN BRITAIN SHORTLY IT WILL BE 
CARRIED PAST SOME OF LONDON'S MOST 
RECOGNISABLE SITES INCLUDING 
CHINATOWN PROTESTS ARE EXPECTED 
DURING THE TORCH PROCESSION ON 
SUNDAY BUT THERE WILL BE SUPPORT 
CHINESE STUDENTS WILL BE AMONG 
THOUSANDS WHO WILL LINE THE ROUTE 
THROUGH THE CAPITAL 
AFTER THE INCIDENTS IN TIBET AND 
INCIDENTS IN ATHENS I THINK IT IS 
LIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE A PROTEST 
OF SOME SORT OR DEMONSTRATION 
DURING THE OLYMPICS I'M CURIOUS 
HOW THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT RESPOND 
AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT 
THEY DO THINGS SENSIBLY AND I THINK 
WE WE ALL SUPPORT 
TOLERANCE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT 
DOES SHOW AND REFLECT ON HOW THE 
CHINESE GOVERNMENT REACTS UPON MORE 
EXTREME SORT OF MEASURES 
DEFINITELY DEFINITELY HOW IMPORTANT IS IT FOR 
YOU THREE TO BE THERE WHEN THE 
TORCH IS BEING CARRIED THROUGH 
LONDON 
IT'S GREAT LONDON IT IS A MOMENT FOR CHINESE PEOPLE 
IN LONDON TO UNITE WILL BE AT 
THE OLYMPICS MYSELF AND THAT WILL 
BE EXCITING I CAN'T WAIT 
ONE HAS TO REMEMBER THE INTENTION 
OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES IS TO PROMOTE 
THE OLYMPIC SPIRIT THROUGH 
COMPETITIVE GAMES THROUGH THE 
GAMES COUNTRIES CAN BUILD LASTING 
PARTNERSHIPS AND FURTHER THEIR IT 
MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND TOLERANCE 
WHEN CHINA CHINA WAS GOING FOR THE 
OLYMPICS IT PROMISED TO OPEN UP 
AND BE MORE LIBERAL AND MORE OPEN 
TO CRITICISM 
THE ELEMENT OF POLITICS WITHIN THE 
OLYMPIC GAMES HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE 
SINCE OVER THREE HUNDRED B. C. WE SHOULD ALWAYS 
BEAR IN MIND AFTER ALL THE ESSENCE 
OF THE GAME IS FRIENDSHIP 
MAYBE THAT SPIRIT OF FRIENDSHIP 
WILL HELP FORWARD CHINA'S RELATIONS 
WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
WHICH COULD HELP USHER IN A MORE 
OPEN FUTURE FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE 
AND FOR THE GENERATIONS TO COME 
THERE WE GO 
WE STICK WITH THIS ISSUE AS THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH COMES TO LONDON THIS 
WEEKEND WE ARE JOINED BY FRANK 
FIELD HE HAS BEEN LEADING CALLS TO 
TRY TO PREVENT CHINA FROM USING THE 
OLYMPICS AS A PROP BEGAN D. A. TOOL 
HE PROPAGANDA TOOL HE IS WITH US 
HERE NOW 
WE CAN BACK TO THE DAILY POLITICS 
WHAT IS IT YOU'RE HOPING TO DO YOU 
COMPARE THE DANGER THERE IS A 
DANGER OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OLYMPICS 
BECOMING LIKE THE NINETEEN THIRTY SIX OLYMPICS 
WHICH WERE USED AS A NAZI SHOW CASE 
IS THAT FAIR COMPARISON 
YES IT 
IS THE LAST TIME NINETEEN THIRTY SIX WHEN THE 
OLYMPICS WENT TO A TOLL TAL TARIAN 
REGIME REGIME IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN SOME 
DEMOCRACY 
VARYING DEGREES AND THE DEMOCRACY VIEW THEN WAS AS IT IS NOW THAT WE 
SHOULDN'T BOYCOTT THE THIRTY SIX OLYMPICS 
BECAUSE IF WE ALL TURNED UP WE 
WOULD CIVILISE THE 
THE THE NAZI 
WE KNOW FAR FROM CIVILISING THEM 
AFTER THE OLYMPIC GAMES G. E. GOT INTO 
GEAR WITH THEIR POLICY TO 
EXTERMINATE THE JEWS MY SUGGESTION 
IS WE DON'T WANT TO BE FOOLED THIS 
TIME BUT JUST BY TURNING UP 
I'M NOT CALLING FOR A BOYCOTT 
YOU'RE NOT 
NO L. DON'T THINK I 
WOULD LIKE ANYBODY TELLING ME WHAT 
TO DO IT IS GOOD NOT TO SUGGEST 
THAT OTHERS YOU SAID THAT THE 
GERMAN LEADER IS NOT GOING THE 
FRENCH LEADER SAYS HE IS NOT GOING 
THERE IS ONE THING 
NOT GOING TO 
THE OPENING CEREMONY 
WHICH WILL BE THE KEY PROPAGANDA 
ISSUE FOR THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT 
BUT SUPPOSING ALL OR MOST OF OUR 
ATHLETES WHO PERSUADED THEIR MATES 
IN OTHER TEAMS TO CARRY THE TIBETAN 
FLAG AT THE OPENING IN DIGNIFIED 
MANNER IT WOULD DO TWO TWO THINGS 
RAISE THE MORAL OF THE PEOPLE IN 
TIBET WHO ARE BEING BUTCHERED IN 
THE WAY THEY ARE BUT SECONDLY IT 
WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR CHINA 
TO USE THE GREAT OPENING CEREMONY 
AS WHAT THEY WANT TO FOR COUNTERING 
DISCONTENT AT HOME DESPITE OUR 
PROBLEMS THE REST OF THE WORLD 
REGARDS CHINA IN THIS VERY PLEASANT 
WAY WAY BUT THE I WAS LOOKING AT SOME OF 
THE OLYMPIC RULES SECTION FIFTY ONE OF 
THE OLYMPIC CHARTER SAYS NO KIND 
OF DEMONSTRATION O. OR POLITICAL 
RELIGIOUS OR RACIAL POP BEGAN D. A. IS 
PERMITTED IN ANY OLYMPIC SITE IF 
THE ATHLETES DID WHAT YOU WANTED 
THEM TO DO THEY WOULD BE BREAKING 
THE OLYMPIC CHARTER 
JUST READING 
THAT OUT CAN YOU GIVE THE GAMES TO 
CHEAUN THAT THE DESIRS HAS BEEN 
MADE AND PEOPLE ARE ARE PREPARING 
TO COMPETE IN THE GAMES 
I DON'T THINK BOYCOTTING WOULD BE 
SUCCESSFUL AND MAYBE THE WRONG MOVE 
IT WOULD BE WRONG TO THINK JUST BY 
TURNING UP AND PARTICIPATING AS 
ATHLETES THAT WE WILL HAVE THE 
EFFECT ON ON THIS WICKED REGIME AS 
WE THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE ON THE 
NAZI NAZI DO YOU DISCOUNT THE VIEWS WE HAD 
FROM OUR CHINESE STUDENTS THERE 
THAT THE OLYMPIC GAMES AND THE 
WORD'S PRESS GOING THERE AND THE 
SPOTLIGHT BEING ON CHINA DOES NOT 
HELP TO OPEN UP CHINA HELPS THE 
FORCES OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
THAT'S WHY 
I THINK THE GAMES SHOULD GO AHEAD 
BUT I THINK THAT GIVEN THE HUGE 
PROPAGANDA QUEUE WE HAVE GIVEN TO 
CHINA THAT WE SHOULD MAKE OUR 
VIEWS KNOWN WE SAW WHEN THE TORCH 
WAS BEGINNING ITS JOURNEY AROUND 
THE WORLD THE CHINESE TELEVISION 
WAS VERY CLEVER IN MAKING THEIR 
THAT THE PROTESTS WERE NOT SEEN IN 
CHINA IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE IF 
GIVEN THAT WE HAD BROKEN THE RULES 
IN GIVING CHINA THE GAMES CHINA IS 
NOT GOING TO STOP THE OPENING 
CEREMONY BECAUSE ATHLETES ARE 
TURNING UP AND SILENTLY CARRYING A 
FLAG OF A COUNTRY THAT IS BEING 
BUTCHERED BY THE CHINESE STATE IT 
WILL BE A SIGN OF BEING ON SIDE 
WITH THE CHINESE PEOPLE AGAINST THE 
TERRIBLE REGIME UNDER WHICH THEY 
SUFFER SUFFER BRIAN PADDICK IF YOU WERE MAYOR OF 
LONDON WHICH IS WHAT YOU WANT TO 
BE IF YOU WERE MAYOR THIS WEEKEND 
WOULD YOU GREET THE OLYMPIC TORCH 
TO THE CITY 
I DON'T THINK THERE IS 
A ROLE FOR THE MAYOR OF LONDON IN 
THE PROGRAMME FOR THE WEEKEND L. 
CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT TO GIVE 
ANYMORE ANYMORE PUBLICITY TO THE 
CHINESE GOVERNMENT THAN IS 
NECESSARY THE MAYOR OF LONDON HAS 
TO GO TO BEIJING TO RECEIVE THE 
OLYMPIC FLAG AT THE CLOSING 
CEREMONY CEREMONY BUT THERE MAYBE NO FORMAL ROLE BUT 
THE TORCH ON THIS HYPOTHETICAL 
SITUATION THAT YOU ARE THE MAYOR 
THE TORCH IS IS COMING TO OUR CITY 
YOU ARE OUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE 
YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE MAYOR WHEN 
THE OLYMPICS COME HERE WOULD YOU 
BOYCOTT THE TORCH 
I WOULDN'T WE NEED TO KEEP HIM 
PIBS AND POLITICS AS FAR AS THE 
MAYOR OF LONDON WE NEED TO KEEP 
THE GAMES AND THE CHINESE RECORD IN 
HUMAN RIGHTS SEPARATE 
ISN'T THAT A 
BIT WEAK YOU ARE RUNNING AS A 
LIBERAL MAYOR 
I THINK THE MISTAKE 
THAT THE CURRENT MAYOR HAS DONE HE 
HAS UNNECESSARILY INVOLVED HIMSELF 
IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS TAKEN SIDES AND 
NOT HELPED THE DIVISIONS THERE ARE 
WITHIN LONDON 
HE HAS GOT INVOLVED 
IN THING LIKE PALESTINE AND THINGS 
WHICH DO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH 
THE MAYOR OF LONDON IF THE 
OLYMPICS ARE COMING TO LONDON AND 
THE TORCH IS COMING TO LONDON THAT 
IS SOMETHING TO DO WITH YOU L. 
DON'T THINK YOU CAN WASH YOUR HANDS 
OF IT 
I'M SAYING YOU SHOULD DO THE 
MINIMUM THAT IS REQUIRED THAT IS 
DECENT TO DO AS BEARING IN MIND 
THAT LONDON WILL BE THE HOST CITY 
MORE THAN 
EIGHTEEN M. P.'S 
IS THAT TALL 
MOTHER OF DEMOCRACY CAN PRODUCE IS 
EIGHTEEN M. P.'S TO BACK YOUR FREEDOM MOTION 
THE SAD FACT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE 
GOT THE PROGRAMME ON MANY MORE 
WILL KNOW 
THAT IS NOT SAD 
IT IS 
THAT WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR ROW TO 
TELL US WHEN LAST YEAR I WAS 
TRYING TO STOP THE GOVERNMENT 
ABOLISHING THE TEN PENCE RATE OF TAX 
VERY MU MEMBERS SEEMED TO CLICK ON 
TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING ALMOST NONE 
OF THEM WERE PREPARED TO VOTE TO 
PREVENT TWO WEEKS BEFORE LOCAL 
ELECTION DAY FIVE MILLION FAMILIES 
LOSING 
I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS WE LOSING DID THAT YESTERDAY ON OUR BIGGEST 
AUDIENCE DAY SO YOU MAY GET 
PROGRESS 
IF WE LOOK AT THE FIGURES PROGRESS IT COULD BE A COMPETITION THE 
EFFECTS ON IT 
YOU HAVE GOT TWO FOR 
THE PRICE OF ONE 
I WILL SHUT UP 
NOW IN HIS BID TO BE MAYOR OF 
LONDON PAD PAD HAS ATTRACTED HIGH 
PROFILE SUPPORT BUT DESPITE 
CELEBRITY SUPPORT T. POLL RATINGS VZ 
NOT BEEN DAZZLING A POLL TODAY 
SUGGESTED HIS SUPPORT IS AROUND TEN PER CENT 
SO WHAT ABOUT HIS POLICIESSOME WELL 
LIKE THE TWO FRONT RUNNERS MR. 
PADDIC HAS PUT CRIME AT THE TOP OF 
HIS BID 
HIS BID 
HE WANTS TO INCREASE THE 
AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING HE 
SAID HE WOULD USE THE MONEY SPENT 
ON TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION TO BUILD 
MORE SOCIAL HOUSING HE IS 
PROMISING TO RETURN TO CONGESTION 
CHARGE TO EIGHT FOR ALL CARS AND SCRAP 
THE TOP RATE TWENTY FIVE 
CHARGE ARE THESE 
POLICIES EYE CATCHING ENOUGH WE 
CONDUCTED OUR OWN STRAW POLL 
HE IS 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT REPRESENTATIVE 
FOR THE ELECTIONS THAT IS AS FAR 
AS I HAVE GOT WITH HIM I'M HOPING 
TO BE REFRESHED BECAUSE THE 
ELECTIONS ARE SOON 
CUTTING CRIME 
BY TWENTY THAT IS VAGUE BECAUSE YOU 
NEED TO KNOW HOW AND WHICH 
INCREASING AFFORDABLE HOUSING WOULD 
BE WONDERFUL SCRAP THE TWENTY FIVE TOP 
RATE CHARGE IVITY IS NOT ADDRESSING 
THE ISSUE ALTHOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE IT GO 
THESE EXPOLICEMAN AND 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT'S CANDIDATES 
DO YOU KNOW HIS NAME NO 
THEY ARE NO ALL TRYING TO CUT CRIME THERE IS 
NOTHING NEW THERE I DON'T THINK 
NO I WOULDN'T VOTE FOR HIM I I DOUBT IT 
THEY DIDN'T SOUND SURE 
LET'S TALK TO BRIAN PADDIC LET'S 
DEAL WITH THE POLLS YOU ARE 
TRAILING BEHIND THE OTHER TWO ON 
TEN PER CENT TWELVE PER CENT RECENTLY SO VUST TWO 
POINTS UP YOU ARE NOT GOING TO WIN 
ON THOSE POLLS 
IT IS A STRANGE 
VOTING SYSTEM THERE IS FIRST 
PREFERENCE AND SECOND PREFERENCE 
VOTES ON THE SECOND I GOT FORTY THREE PER CENT 
RELYING ON THE SECOND PREFERENCE IS 
ALMOST AN ADMISSION YOU WON'T WIN 
THE FIRST 
PEOPLE AT THE MOMENT 
THEY KNOW KEN AND BORIS HIGH 
PROFILE FIGURES AND PEOPLE ARE 
SAYING WELL I WILL VOTE ALONG PARTY 
LINES NOW WE ARE INTO THE 
REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE ACT 
WE GET EQUAL AIR TIME PEOPLE ARE 
GOING TO START SEEING ME 
UNDERSTANDING WHAT I STAND FOR AND 
TO KNOW ME IS TO LOVE ME 
YOU ARE 
UP AGAINST NOT JUST TWO HIGH 
PROFILE CANDIDATES BECAUSE OF THE 
PARTIES THEY HIGH PROFILE BECAUSE 
OF THEIR PERSONALITIES NOT WANTING 
TO CAST ASPERSIONS YOU MAY COME 
SHINING THROUGH BUT THEY HAVE THAT 
EXTRA PUBLICITY HOW ARE YOU GOING 
TO OUTDO THEM 
WHAT THE 
CONSERVATIVE VOTERS THAT I HAVE 
SPOKEN TO ARE NERVOUS ABOUT 
ELECTING BORIS JOHNSON WITH GOOD 
REASON EVEN THE LABOUR SUPPORTERS 
ARE NERVOUS ABOUT KEN LIVINGSTONE 
BECAUSE OF HIS RECORD L. DON'T 
THINK THESE VOTES ARE FIRM L. DON'T THINK 
MIND THE SECOND 
PREFERENCES IT WILL TAKE MUCH TO 
SHIFT THE AMOUNT OF THOSE SECOND 
PREFERENCES INTO FIRST PREFERENCES 
AS YOU SAY THERE IS THIS SYSTEM 
WHEREBY PEOPLE CAN WIN ON THE 
SECOND PREFERENCE KEN LIVINGSTONE 
AND THE GREEN CANDIDATE MAY OR MAY 
NOT HAVE STIPD UP DEAL ABOUT 
YOUR SECOND PREFERENCE THE 
INDICATIONS THAT THEY WILL GO TO 
BORIS JOHNSON 
WHAT I SAID TO 
PEOPLE AND I SAID TO ANY QUESTIONS 
ON FRIDAY WHAT I WOULD ADVISE 
PEOPLE TO DO VOTE WITH YOUR 
CONSCIENCE FIRST PREFERENCE VOTE 
FOR THE BEST CANDIDATE NO MATTER 
WHO THEY ARE CLEARLY I'M THE BEST 
SO THEY SHOULD VOTE FOR ME AND 
THEY SHOULD VOTE WITH THEIR PARTY 
LOYALTY THAT WILL MAKE SURE THE 
PERSON THEY DON'T WANT TO GET IN 
DOES NOT GET IN 
YOU ARE NOT DIRECT 
THEM ONE WAY OR ANOTHER NO ON NO ON POLICIES ONE THING THAT MUST HAVE 
DISA POINTED YOU CRIME I WHICH 
IS YOUR TOP POLICY THAT TARGET OF 
CUTTING TWENTY PER CENT WHICH PEOPLE WILL SAY 
IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT HAS NOT PUSH 
YOU'D FURTHER AHEAD PUSHED YOU 
FURTHER AHEAD 
CRIME IS THE BIGGEST 
ISSUE IN LONDON IT IS ABOUT 
GETTING PEOPLE TO HERE AND 
UNDERSTAND WHAT MY PRACTICAL 
POLICIES ARE 
HOW WILL YOU DELIVER 
THAT TWENTY PER CENT CUT 
SIMPLY THE MAYOR CAN 
CHAIR THE POLICE AUTHORITY THE 
POLICE AUTHORITY SELECT THE 
PRIORITIES FOR THE POLICE IN LONDON 
AND WHAT I WOULD GET THE POLICE TO 
DO IS CONCENTRATE ON THE ISSUES 
THAT ARE OF MOST CONCERN TO PEOPLE 
MORE POLICE OFFICERS 
WE WOULD GET 
THE POLICE AND THE PUBLIC BACK 
STANDING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER 
AGAINST GUN AND KNIFE CRIME FE CAN 
CAN GET LONDONERS HAVING TRUST AND 
CONFIDENCE IN THE POLICE WHICH 
WILL SEE A SEA CHANGE IN LONDON ON ON TRANSPORT PARTICULARLY THE IDEA 
THAT YOU WILL SCRAP THIS TWENTY FIVE TOP 
RATE THAT DOES NOT SOUND VERY 
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT TRYING TO TAKE 
AWAY THE TOP RATE THAT WILL CLAMP 
DOWN ON GAS GUZZLING CARS 
ITS IS 
THE PACKAGE OF MEASURES IT IS THAT 
HE WILL EXEMPT ALL THE SMALL CARS 
THOUSANDS OF SMALL CARS WILL BE 
EXEMPT FROM THE CHARGE THAT WILL 
CREATE MORE CONGESTION AND MORE 
POLLUTION IN LONDON
