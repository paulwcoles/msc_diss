I'M JOHNNY KINGDOM AND FOR THE LAST YEAR I'VE BEEN FILMING WILDLIFE ON OUR LAND 
AND I'VE ALREADY GOT SOME FANTASTIC SHOTS 
THIS IS THE FIRST BIRD THAT I'VE SEEN COMING HERE 
I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL AND ON TOP OF THAT I SAW A STAG WENT PAST JUST NOW BEHIND THE HERON 
A STAG 
BUT SAYING ALL THAT I'VE HAD NO LUCK FILMING DORMICE 
SO THIS WEEK I'M OFF TO SOMERSET TO TRY AND FILM ONE THERE 
OH WHAT A BEAUTIFUL THING 
AND THERE'S AN ANIMAL COMING TO MY LAND 
THAT I'VE BEEN HOPING TO SEE AGAIN WHICH HAS BEEN ON EXMOOR ALL YEAR 
IT'S THE SCARIEST THING I'VE EVER FILMED 
LOOK AT THOSE EYES LOOK 
LITTLE GHOSTY EYES 
IT'S AUGUST A BEAUTIFUL TIME OF THE YEAR ON EXMOOR 
THE HEATHER IS ALL LOVELY AND PURPLE 
AND THE STAGS ARE GROWING THEIR ANTLERS AGAIN 
BUT WE'VE BEEN HAVING SOME REALLY WET WEATHER 
AND THAT'S BEEN A WORRY DOWN ON THE LAND 
WHEN I BOUGHT IT I GOT JONATHAN A MATE FROM OUR VILLAGE TO PLANT WHEAT IN OUR TWO TOP FIELDS 
AND I DON'T WANT IT RUINED BY THE WEATHER 
IT'S AN OLD FASHIONED TYPE OF WHEAT 
THE TYPE THEY USE FOR THATCHING 
AND I'VE BEEN WATCHING IT GROW ALL THROUGH THE YEAR 
IT LOOKS JUST BEAUTIFUL 
BUT WE WANT TO GET IT CUT WHILE IT'S DRY 
AND BEFORE THE DEER EAT IT ALL 
LOOK THERE'S THE GRAIN 
FROM THE WHEAT 
AND THAT'S WHAT THE DEER LIKE 
VERY SOFT YOU CAN EVEN EAT IT YOURSELF 
IT'S NICE 
SEE THAT'S WHY THE DEER LIKE IT BECAUSE I LIKE IT 
AND THERE HE IS LOOK 
HE'S JUST HELPING HISSELF INNIT 
GREEDY LITTLE TOAD 
AND IT'S NOT ONLY THE DEER 
JUST LOOK AT THIS 
LAST SPRING WE LET GO SOME HARES ON MY LAND 
BUT IT'S NICE TO THINK THAT THIS ONE COULD HAVE BEEN BORN HERE 
WELL I'M GLAD THEY'RE ENJOYING IT 
BECAUSE LATER THIS MORNING JONATHAN'S COMING TO CUT IT ALL 
RIGHT NOW THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE I WANT TO SHOW YOU DOWN IN THE WOOD 
I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER ANIMAL DOING SOMETHING ON MY LAND 
LATELY I'VE SEEN A LOT OF FRESH DIGGINGS BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S BADGERS 
THERE'S TOO MUCH OF IT 
THERE IS LITTLE PRINTS HERE 
I'VE SEEN A PRINT THERE BUT IT DIDN'T LOOK VERY BIG 
SOMETHING'S TELLING ME THERE'S WILD BOAR ON MY LAND 
NOW I DON'T THINK SO 
BECAUSE I WENT MILES AWAY TO SEE THE WILD BOAR BUT NOW TRYING TO TELL ME IT'S ON MY LAND 
HARD TO BELIEVE 
TWO YEARS AGO NINETY WILD BOAR WERE LET OUT ONTO EXMOOR 
AND SINCE THEN DIFFERENT ONES HAVE BEEN SEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE 
I CAME ACROSS ONE LAST SUMMER 
I DON'T MIND TELLING YOU IT SCARED ME HALF TO DEATH 
WELL I'VE NEVER SEEN THE LIKE OF THIS IN ALL MY LIFE 
AND HE'S IN A WILD MOOD 
WELL LOOK 
THAT'S MORE EVIDENCE 
THERE'S QUITE A LOT IN THE WOOD 
IF I'VE GOT WILD BOAR COMING ONTO MY LAND I'VE GOT TO TRY AND FILM THEM 
I THINK MY BEST CHANCE WILL BE WHEN IT GETS DARK 
I'M GOING TO HAVE A LOOK AROUND TONIGHT 
BUT RIGHT NOW JONATHAN'S TEAM ARE MAKING A START ON THE WHEAT 
AND JONATHAN'S BEEN DOING THIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW 
HE GOES AROUND YOU SEE AND HE RENTS ALL THESE FIELDS ALL OVER THE SOUTHWEST 
TIS NICE TO WATCH THESE BINDERS THEY'RE FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS OLD 
THE WHEAT PITCHES ON LIKE THAT GOES ON THE BELTS LIKE THAT UP THERE AND COMES OUT INTO A SHEATH 
KICKS IT OUT MARVELLOUS YOU KNOW TO SEE THAT 
JONATHAN USES THESE OLD MACHINES 
BECAUSE THEY PROTECT THE STALKS WHICH THEY NEED FOR THATCHING 
THEY GOT THREE BINDERS WORKING 
WHEN HE THRASH THIS THAT GOES FOR ANIMAL FEED SOME BREAD 
THE STALKS IS FOR THE ROOFING AND THE STRAW GOES FOR ANIMAL BEDDING 
SO IT'S ALL DONE FOR SOMETHING THERE'S NOTHING WASTED AT ALL 
WELL THAT WAS A GOOD DAY'S WORK 
TONIGHT I'M GOING TO COME BACK AND SEE IF I CAN SPOT A WILD BOAR 
BUT BEFORE THAT I'M OFF NOW TO SEE IF I CAN FILM A LOVELY BIRD THAT I'VE BEEN WATCHING 
THE OTHER DAY I WAS OUT FILMING A BARN OWL I GOT SOME LOVELY SHOTS 
BARN OWL WAS OUT HUNTING 
AND I FOUND OUT WHERE THE NEST WAS 
SO NOW I'M GOING BACK THERE HOPING TO FILM THE CHICK IN ITS NEST SO I GOT AN IDEA 
COURSE WE GOT TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL HERE BECAUSE OWLS ARE PROTECTED 
ESPECIALLY ROUND THE NESTING AREA 
SO I'VE DECIDED TO LEAVE THE CREW BEHIND 
THE CHICKS ARE IN A NESTING BOX UP THERE 
SO I'VE COME HERE TONIGHT HOPEFULLY TO TRY AND FILM THEM 
BUT TO DO THIS I WANT TO CLIMB THAT BIG LADDER OVER THERE 
THEY PUT UP A LADDER FOR ME TO GO UP THERE AND SIT ON THAT BRANCH AND JUST WAIT 
THIS WILL TAKE HOURS AND HOURS OF PATIENCE 
I'VE GOT MYSELF UP THE TREE NOW 
AND THERE'S THE HOLE OVER THERE 
BUT IF THE OWL WAS TO STAY ON THE ENTRANCE IT WOULD BE IDEAL 
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW DO YOU EH 
IT'S GETTING DARKER NOW 
IT'S JUST NINE HUNDRED TWENTY 
NO SIGNS YET 
YOU SEE I CAN HEAR THE PIGEON CALLING 
BUT I CAN ALSO HEAR THE OWLS SISSING 
IT GOES SSSSSS 
THAT'S THE NOISE IT MAKES SSSSSS 
IT'S GETTING DARKER AND DARKER 
IT'S NEAR ENOUGH TEN O'CLOCK NOW 
NO LUCK 
OH THAT WAS QUICK 
WHERE'S HE TO 
OH HE'S RIGHT BESIDE OF ME 
THE OWL'S GONE AWAY NOW AND I'M GOING TO TRY MY LIGHT 
OH THERE LOOK THERE HE IS IN THE HOLE 
OH THAT'S BRILLIANT 
I CAN ONLY SEE ONE BIG CHICK IN THE NEST 
THAT'S HANDSOME THAT IS 
SO THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL THAT WAS SEEING THAT OWL CHICK IN THE NEST 
BUT NOW I'M GOING BACK TO MY LAND HOPEFULLY TO SEE A WILD BOAR 
RIGHT CAMERAMAN I WANT YOU TO STAY HERE 
I'M GOING TO DRIVE AROUND THE FIELDS AND SEE WHAT I CAN SEE 
BUT THIS COULD BE DANGEROUS MIND 
RIGHT I'M GOING TO SWITCH MY CAMERA ON NOW AND SEE IF I CAN SEE SOMETHING UP THERE 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S UP HERE 
YEAH THERE GOES A RABBIT 
MAYBE A YOUNG LEVERET I DON'T KNOW 
NOW I'M GOING ACROSS THE CORNFIELD NOW HOPEFULLY TO SEE SOMETHING ELSE 
WHAT'S THAT 
OH I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I'M SEEING 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS 
JUST LOOK AT IT LOOK WILD BOAR 
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN OUGHT LIKE IT 
WELL I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT LOT 
JUST LOOK AT IT OH BOY 
OH MY EYE WHERE'S IT GONE 
THERE'S ONE THERE 
WELL WELL 
WHAT A NIGHT I DON'T BELIEVE IT 
D'YOU KNOW YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS 
I WAS OUT THERE I DROVE ALL THE WAY ROUND AND I SEE'D AT LEAST A DOZEN WILD BOAR 
THERE'S A WHITE ONE THERE SURE 
TWO BIG UNS AND A LOT OF SMALL ONES THEY MUST BE BREEDING THERE 
BUT I'VE GOT AN IDEA TO FILM THESE THIS IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT 
I'VE GOT AN INFRA RED CAMERA SO I'M COMING BACK AGAIN AND STICKING IT DOWN THERE SOMEWHERE 
AND TRY GET THESE BOAR IT'S GOING TO BE HARD IT'S GOING TO BE HARD 
RIGHT THIS IS MY INFRA RED CAMERA I'M GOING TO PUT IT OVER THERE 
THE ANIMAL BEEN COMING THROUGH THE GAP IN THE HEDGE THERE 
SO HOPEFULLY TONIGHT WHEN IT GETS REALLY DARK I SHALL CATCH IT ON CAMERA 
I'M HOPING ANYWAY 
THAT'S THE CAMERA 
NOW THE NEXT THING IS PUT SOME FOOD DOWN 
THERE 
RIGHT 
I'VE GOT MY FOOD THERE MY CAMERA'S THERE 
SO HOPEFULLY THEY'LL GET THE SHOT 
TONIGHT 
I'M HERE WAITING FOR MICHAEL WOODS TO COME 
A FEW MONTHS AGO HE CAME DOWN HERE AND PUT UP SOME DORMOUSE BOXES 
TO FIND OUT IF I'VE GOT ANY DORMOUSE IN MY WOOD 
MICHAEL FIXED NESTING BOXES ON THE BRANCHES OF SOME OF THE HAZEL TREES 
THE DORMOUSE LOVES THOSE NUT TREES 
COURSE I HAD MY OWN IDEA ABOUT A NEST 
CUT A HOLE IN A TENNIS BALL SO THE MOUSE WILL GO IN WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT 
WELL IT COULD SMELL OF RUBBER YOU KNOW 
BUT D'YOU KNOW I HAD A TRICK UP MY SLEEVE I DIDN'T TELL HIM ABOUT IT 
HELLO MICHAEL HI JOHNNY SORRY I'M LATE 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT NO PROBLEM LET'S SEE IF YOU'VE GOT ANY DORMICE THEN SHALL WE 
DORMICE ARE PROTECTED SO I CAN'T OPEN THE BOXES 
BUT MICHAEL HE'S GOT A LICENCE 
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHOSE NEST WORKS BEST 
HIS BOXES OR MY TENNIS BALLS NO LUCK MICHAEL NO NO 
SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN MY TENNIS BALLS WHICH YOU DIDN'T LIKE REMEMBER 
I REMEMBER YOU WERE LAUGHING LIKE YOU ARE NOW 
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING WRONG 
THEY'RE ALL DISAPPEARING REALLY YEAH D'YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE DONE 
I KEPT PUTTING PEANUTS INSIDE OF 'EM 
AND THE SQUIRRELS COME ALONG AND TOOK 'EM AWAY AND I WAS PUTTING THE BALLS BACK AGAIN 
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU COMING BUT THIS ONE WHEN I CAME TO FILM IT HE WAS SOLID 
HE WAS SOLID WITH LEAVES OR SOMETHING 
THAT'S FROM THE BEECH TREE AND SOME WOODLICE AND WHAT THAT PROBABLY IS 
WOOD MOUSE WOOD MICE YEAH WOOD MICE TAKING THEM UP AND STORING THEM IN THERE 
WELL I'M DAMNED THAT'S STRANGE 
I PUT PEANUTS IN THEM AND THE SQUIRRELS TOOK 'EM AWAY YES 
AT LEAST I GOT SOMETHING SO CAN YOU BETTER THAT ONE 
WELL YOU WANT TO SEE A DORMOUSE REALLY YES 
SO WE'LL GO UP TO THE MENDIPS AND SEE WHAT WE CAN SHOW YOU 
NOW WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE NESTING BOXES THAT MICHAEL'S PUT OUT 
HE TELLS ME THAT HE'S GOT TWO HUNDRED BOXES IN THESE TWO WOODS 
I WANT TO LEARN WHAT TO DO TO GET SOME DORMICE INTO MY WOOD 
THERE'S ONLY ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY 
SO I RECKON WE'LL BE REALLY LUCKY TO SEE EVEN ONE 
AND WHAT WE DO IS PUT IT IN A BIG POLYTHENE BAG 
AND YOU PUT IT IN A BAG SO NO ESCAPE I SUPPOSE NO THAT'S RIGHT 
WE'VE ALREADY FOUND A NEST BUT THERE'S NO ONE AT HOME 
THAT'S A SHAME 
QUITE A BIG NEST ISN'T IT 
WELL THEY TRY AND FILL THE BOX 
INSIDE YOU'LL SEE A TIGHTLY WOVEN NEST YES I CAN SEE THAT 
WHICH IS WOVEN A LOT OF THE TIME OUT OF HONEYSUCKLE BARK 
COS THAT SAVES THEM COMING DOWN TO THE GROUND 
THEY GO UP IN THE TREES AND GET LONG STRANDS OF BARK AND BRING IT BACK WEAVE IT ROUND INTO THIS TIGHT NEST 
RIGHT NEXT BOX LET'S HOPE THIS ONE WILL GIVE US SOME LUCK 
OH NOTHING 
SO THERE'S BOXES EVERYWHERE YEAH 
NO ANOTHER EMPTY ONE NOTHING AGAIN 
NOW LET'S SEE IS THERE SOMETHING IN THIS ONE 
OH WE'VE GOT A NEST I WANT TO SEE HANG ON I CAN'T SEE 
THERE'S SOMETHING MOVING AROUND 
IT'S COMING OUT THE END YEAH AH 
OH LOOK AT THAT 
OH MOUSE COME OUT 
WE'VE FOUND A WOOD MOUSE WHICH SOME PEOPLE CALL A FIELD MOUSE 
HELLO MATE HELLO 
COME ON DO A BIT OF GROOMING LIKE YOU'VE DONE JUST NOW 
GO ON THERE HE IS NOW HE'S LOOK AT THAT AIN'T THAT WONDERFUL 
THEY'RE LOVELY CREATURES 
LET THE MOUSE GO TO FREEDOM 
THAT WAS WONDERFUL THAT NOW WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUR DORMOUSE 
THERE'S ONE LEFT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACK WHICH WE CAN LOOK IN 
WELL HE GOT ANOTHER BOX 
AND I'M BEGINNING TO PUFF A BIT 
WE WALKED SEVERAL MILES GOING ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND 
MICHAEL SAYS THERE'S A NEST IN THIS ONE BUT 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS SOMETHING IN THERE RIGHT 
NOW THERE'S SOMETHING IN THIS ONE 
IN THE BAG OH THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL WE'VE GOT A DORMOUSE 
NOW THIS IS WHEN I GET EXCITED

WAY UP IN THAT BIT OF THE WOOD AND HE'S COME BACK DOWN 
I'VE BEEN HERE QUITE A LONG LONG TIME 
BUT LOOK IT WAS ALL WORTH IT IN THE END 
MICHAEL WHAT SHOULD I ACTUALLY DO ON MY LAND TO ATTRACT 'EM THEN 
WELL I THINK THE THINGS YOU NEED TO DO ARE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SHRUBS 
GET MORE OF A SHRUB LAYER AND LESS OF THE CANOPY 
GET LIGHT INTO THE WOODLAND 
SO YOU MAY HAVE TO TAKE SOME TREES OUT IN ORDER TO GET MORE LIGHT IN SO THAT THEY PRODUCE LOTS OF FRUIT 
WELL THAT'S SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT FOR NEXT YEAR 
IT'S ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL MORNING AND I'M REALLY EXCITED 
I LEFT MY INFRA RED CAMERA ON MY LAND ALL NIGHT LAST NIGHT TO SEE IF I CAN GET A SHOT OF THOSE WILD BOAR 
WELL I'M GOING TO CHECK MY CAMERA BECAUSE ALL THE FOOD IS DISAPPEARED 
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE IT OUT NOW AND SIT DOWN THERE ON THE BANK OPEN IT UP AND HAVE A LOOK
