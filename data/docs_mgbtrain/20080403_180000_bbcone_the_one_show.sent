WELCOME TO THE ONE SHOW WITH 
ADRIAN CHILES AND CHRISTINE BLEAKLY 
TONIGHT'S STAR TURN PHIL JUPITUS 
LOVELY TO HAVE YOU HERE 
ALSO SHARING OUR HUMBLE HOME GYLES 
BRANDRETH AND LUCY SIEGLE 
AND OUR 
BUG MAN GEORGE MCGAVIN WHO HAS A 
COUPLE OF BATS WITH HIM 
IT'S FIFTY YEARS SINCE THALIDOMIDE WAS 
HAILED AS THE NEW WONDER DRUG FOR 
MORNING SICKNESS BUT THEN TEN THOUSAND 
BABIES WERE BORN WITH SEVERE 
PHYSICAL DEFECTS 
MANY OF THOSE 
AFFECTED ARE STILL FIGHTING FOR 
MORE COMPENSATION FROM THE GERMAN 
MAKERS OF THALIDOMIDE AND INDEED 
THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT THEY 
DEMONSTRATED OUTSIDE THE GERMAN 
EMBASSY IN LONDON TODAY 
GARY SKYNER A COMEDIAN WAS ONE OF 
THEM HERE IS HIS STORY 
I'M GARY FOR THE PAST TWENTY TWO YEARS 
I'VE BEEN A SUCCESSFUL STAND UP 
COMEDIAN FOOTBALL REFEREE AND 
FATHER OF TWO NOT BAD FOR SOMEONE 
COMING UP TO THE BIG FIFTY FOR ME 
IT'S AN EXTRA ACHIEVEMENT YOU SEE 
NO ONE EXPECTED ME TO REACH THIS 
AGE AS I'M THALIDOMIDE ER 
IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT THALIDOMIDE BEGAN TO BE 
PRESCRIBED TO EXPECTANT MOTHERS TO 
COMBAT MORNING SICKNESS IT WAS 
THOUGHT TO BE AN ENTIRELY SAFE DRUG 
IT WAS WITHDRAWN IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE AFTER A 
CONNECTION WAS MADE BETWEEN THE 
DRUG AND A HUGE RISE IN THE NUMBER 
OF DEFORMED BABIES BEING BORN THE THE TRUE STORY OF HOW THE EVIDENCE THAT 
THALIDOMIDE WAS VERY 
TOXIC IT 
CAUSED DEFORMITIES IN SO MANY 
CHILDREN HAD BEEN SUPPRESSED SO 
THE SUNDAY TIMES SET OUT ON A MORAL 
CAMPAIGN TO TELL THE STORIES OF 
WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO HAVE A 
THALIDOMIDE CHILD 
AS A REPORTER 
MARJORIE TRAVELLED UP AND DOWN THE 
COUNTRY MEETING THALIDOMIDE 
FAMILIES AND SEEING FIRST HAND THE 
DAMAGE THAT HAD BEEN CAUSED NOBODY NOBODY WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT THESE 
DEFORMITIES THE PARENTS WERE 
BLAMED FAMILIES BROKE UP UNDER THE 
STRAIN IT WASN'T REALLY UNTIL THE 
SUNDAY TIMES WEEK AFTER WEEKS 
TOLD THE NATION ABOUT THE HORRORS 
OF THIS STORY THAT THE BATTLE XOR 
COMPENSATION BEGAN 
MY MOTHER'S 
MARRIAGE WAS ONE OF THE ONES THAT 
BROKE DOWN SHE LIKE THOUSANDS OF 
OTHER MUMS WASN'T JUST LEFT WITH A 
PHYSICAL BATTLE BUT ALSO A MENTAL 
ONE OF GUILT 
HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU CRY YOURSELF 
ASLEEP AT NIGHT 
QUITE A GOOD FEW 
I KNOW I'LL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN 
BECAUSE I ALWAYS THINK YOUR ARMS 
WOULD BE NORMAL LIKE ANY OTHER BOY 
IT'S A THING I WILL NEVER FORGET 
ABOUT IT IN MY LIFE 
TO BE HONEST 
WITH YOU IT MIGHT SOUND PERVERSE 
BUT THIS IS THE BEST THING THAT'S 
EVER HAPPENED TO ME WE GO THROUGH 
LIFE AS A NUMBER HOW MANY TIMES DO 
PEOPLE GO TO A CLUB GET DRUNK AND 
SAY THE NEXT MORNING THAT COMIC 
WAS FUNNY WHO WAS HIS NAME BUT 
WHEN THEY SAY HE HAS SHORT ARMS AND 
COMES FROM LIVERPOOL IT'S NARROWS 
THE MARGIN I'M HAPPY L. HAVE A 
NICE FAMILY A NICE HOME A NICE 
LIFESTYLE AND ENJOY LIFE TO THE 
FULL BUT NOT EVERYONE IS AS 
FORTUNATE AS ME 
ONE OF THOSE LESS FORTUNATE IS MY 
MATE KEVIN KEVIN IS A LOT WORSE 
OFF THAN I AM HE HAS NO ARMS AND 
NO LEGS AT LEAST I WAS ABLE TO 
PLAY FOOTBALL AS A KID AND GET UP 
AND WALK AWAY FROM SITUATIONS 
WHEREAS KEVIN HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE 
TO DO THAT AND I THINK IT'S SO SAD 
YOU'D THINK THAT SOMEBODY WITH THAT 
MUCH WRONG WITH THEM WOULD NOT BE 
PLEASANT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM 
HAVE NOTHING TO SMILE ABOUT KEVIN 
IS JUST A BUNDLE OF FUN HOPEFULLY 
SKROUNG A CUP OF TEA OFF HIM AS 
WELL ARE YOU IN 
HELLO YOU LITTLE REPROBATE YOU 
WHEREAS I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO 
BE AFFECTED BY THE DRUG KEVIN WAS 
BEING BORN JUST AS THALIDOMIDE WAS 
BEING WITHDRAWN 
I KNOW WHEN I WAS 
BEING BORN IN ALDER HEY THE NURSE 
TOLD MY MOTHER YOU MAY AS WELL 
LEAVE HIM HERE BECAUSE HE WON'T 
LIVE THAT LONG SHE SAID SHE'D TAKE 
ME HOME 
PEOPLE WOULDN'T BELIEVE 
WHAT YOU COPE WITH YOU HAVE A 
LOVELY HOME 
I LIVE THE WAY I WANT 
TO LIVE MY DEFINITION OF 
INDEPENDENT LIVING IS THAT I MAKE 
THE DECISIONS L. STILL HAVE A CARER 
WHO COMES IN MY P. A. SO I CAN'T DO 
EVERYTHING FOR MYSELF BUT AT LEAST 
I'M LIVING THE LIFE I WANT TO LIVE 
YOU KNOW YOURSELF BECAUSE WE'VE 
BEEN DISABLED FROM DAY ONE YOU GET 
ON WITH IT WHEN I'M IN A PUB 
PEOPLE SAY DO YOU WANT A P. PINT I 
SAY NO THANKS I'M DRIVING THEY 
LOOK AT MY WHEELCHAIR AND LAUGH 
THEY ASSUME I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT 
THE WHEELCHAIR THEY CAN'T XEPBD I 
AM ANTICIPATE ON THE ROAD IN AN 
ORDINARY VAN 
DO YOU FEEL BITTER 
NOT BITTER BUT I'VE ALWAYS DONE 
THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE NOT 
EXPECTED ME TO ANOTHER EXPECTATION 
IS THAT WE'LL BE SINGLE ALL OF OUR 
LIVES YOU HAVE KIDS AND YOU'RE 
MARRIED NONE OF THEM THE SO 
CALLED MEDICAL EXPERTS EXPECTED ANY 
OF THAT IN FACT THEY DIDN'T THINK 
WE'D LIVE THAT LONG 
IT'S A FACT THAT WE'VE SURVIVED 
THAT'S SURPRISED THE PROFESSIONALS 
COMPENSATION WAS LOW IN THE SEVENTIES 
AND I'VE COME TO SPEAK TO A 
SOLICITOR TO FIND OUT WHY 
IN THE MIND OF THE PEOPLE DEALING 
WITH IT AT THAT TIME THEY 
COULDN'T REALLY LOOK INTO THE 
FUTURE ANY CLAIM LOOKING INTO 
FUTURE IS ALMOST CRYSTAL BALL 
GAZEING BUT AT THAT TIME ALLOWANCE 
WASN'T MADE IN MY VIEW FOR THE 
FUTURE LOSS OF EARNINGS OR 
POTENTIAL FUTURE LOSS OF EARNINGS 
WE KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR A 
LOT OF DISABLED PEOPLE TO OBTAIN 
JOBS AND HOLD THEM DOWN 
I'M ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES L. CAN GO 
OUT THERE TONIGHT AND MAKE PEOPLE 
LAUGH ARTHUR ASHLEY SAID YOU HAVE 
TO BE A COMEDIAN TO COME FROM 
LIVERPOOL THAT'S WHERE I COME FROM 
AND IT'S WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING 
I'M OFF IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW 
WHAT TO SAY ABOUT GARY WITHOUT 
PATRONISING HIM L. THINK THAT'S A 
REMARKABLE STORY 
AUPLT PEOPLE 
THERE ARE TODAY PEOPLE STILL 
DEMONSTRATING FIFTY YEARS LATER ABOUT 
THIS 
THESE PEOPLE ARE MIDDLEAGED THIS NOW 
IT'S A HUGE ISSUE L. REMEMBER NOW WHEN I WAS A KID IT CAME ALONG 
OOPBD IT HAS HAPPENED THE BAN WAS 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE ONE MUM GOT OFFERED IT IN 
NINETEEN SIXTY ONE WHICH WAS THE YEAR IT GOT 
BANNED IT WAS LIKE IT'S AN 
EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION THAT IT'S 
STILL CONVERSATION STILL HASN'T 
BEEN COMPENSATION STILL HASN'T 
BEEN ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED 
DID YOU 
KNOW WHY YOUR MUM DIDN'T OPT FOR 
IT 
SHE'S JUST NOT A DRUGGIE PERSON IT MOTHEROK 
EARLIER THIS YEAR WE MOTHEROK VISITED THE AREA OF BELFAST THAT 
INSPIRED C. S. LEWIS TO WRITE ABOUT 
THE LAND OF NARNIA MANY OF YOU 
CONTACTED US WITH STORIES OF HOW 
YOUR LOCAL AREAS INSPIRED SOME OF 
THE GREATEST STORIES EVER TOLD WE 
SENT GYLES BRANDRETH ON THE TRAIL 
OF THE TOWNS AND CITIES AT THE 
HEART OF SOME OF OUR BEST LOVED 
BOOKS TODAY IT'S A HORROR CLASSIC 
TO MAKE YOUR BLOOD RUN COLD 
SCARY MUSIC 
THE ANCIENT YORKSHIRE TOWN OF 
WHITBY A BEAUTIFUL PLACE IT 
REMAINS AS IT ALWAYS HAS BUSY WITH 
BOTH FISHERMEN AND TOURISTS BUT IN 
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IT WOULD FIND A 
NEW FAME GIVING INSPIRATION FOR 
ONE OF THE MOST FRIGHTENING 
LITERARY CHARACTERS OF ALL TIME 
IT'S ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY AND AN IRISHMAN CALLED 
BRAM STOKER A THEATRE MANAGER AND 
WOULD BE AUTHOR HAS COME TO TAKE A 
SIX WEEK HOLIDAY HERE AT THE BACK 
OF HIS MIND HE HAS THE GERM OF AN 
IDEA FOR A TERRIFYING TALE ABOUT A 
SUPER NATURAL VILLAIN THE STORY 
OF COURSE WOULD BECOME THE HORROR 
CLASSIC DRACULA 
AS THE CLOUD PASSED I COULD SEE 
THE RUINS OF THE ABBEY COME INTO 
VIEW THE CHURCH AND CHURCHYARD 
BECAME GRADUALLY VISIBLE THE LIGHT 
STRUCK A HALF RECLIENG FIGURE 
SNOWY WHITE IT SEEMED TO ME AS 
THOUGH SOMETHING DARK STOOD BEHIND 
WHAT IT WAS WHETHER MAN OR BEAST 
I I COULD NOT TELL 
IT'S HERE IN THE TOWN'S SAINT MARY'S 
CHURCHYARD THAT COUNTY DRACULA 
CLAIMS HIS FIRST VICTIM HERE TOO 
THAT STOKER CAME FOR INSPIRATION 
IN THIS GRAVEYARD EVEN THE STONES 
TELL YOU THAT STOKER CAME HERE 
WHILE WRITE THE DRACULA STORY FROM 
THE GRAVE STONES HE TOOK NAMES FOR 
THE CHARACTERS IN HIS BOOK 
ONE 
GRAVE BEARS THE NAME OF SWALE AN 
OLD SEAFARER IN THE STORY FROM 
ANOTHER JOHN STEWARD INSPIRES THE 
NAME OF ONE OF THE BOOK'S HEROES 
THE GOTHIC ATMOSPHERE OF NINETEENTH 
CENTURY WHITBY WHICH SO INSPIRED 
STOKER SURVIVES TODAY IN THIS 
GALLERY HERE THE WORK OF THE 
TOWN'S RENOWNED VICTORIAN 
PHOTOGRAPHER TAKES A LOOK AT THE 
TOWN STOKER KNEW THESE PICTURES 
ARE SO INCREDIBLY PROVOCATIVE 
ATMOSPHERIC GOTHIC HORROR IS 
WRITTEN ALL OVER THE PHOTOGRAPH 
YOU CAN SEE HOW BRAM STOKER WAS 
INSPIRED BY BOTH WHITBY AND 
SUTCLIFFE'S PHOTOGRAPHS 
I'M ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN ONE 
PHOTOGRAPH OF A SHIP RUN AGROUND 
HERE FIVE YEARS BEFORE STOKER 
VISITED IN THE BOOK COUNTY DRACULA 
HIMSELF ARRIVES IN WHITBY IN A 
SIMILAR WRECK 
THE WAVES ROSE IN GROWING FURY AND 
SWEPT THE LIGHTHOUSES WHICH RISE 
FROM EITHER PIER OF WHITBY HARBOUR 
BEFORE LONG THE SEARCH LIGHT FOUND 
A SCHOONER IT WAS RUSHING WITH 
SUCH SPEEDS THAT SHE MUST FETCH UP 
SOMEWHERE IF ONLY IN HELL THE 
SHIP PHOTOGRAPHED BY SUTCLIFFE RAN 
AGROUND ON THIS BEACH BENEATH 
WHITBY'S EAST CLIFF WITHIN EAR 
SHOT OF THE BELLS OF SAINT MARY'S 
CHURCH I'VE COME TO FIND OUT MORE 
FROM LOCAL HISTORIAN HARRY 
SO IT'S 
SO IT'S ON THIS BEACH THAT DRACULA LANDS 
YES OFF A RUSSIAN SHIP IN THE GUISE 
OF A LARGE BLACK DOG FIVE YEARS 
BEFORE STOKER WROTE HIS BOOK A 
RUSSIAN SHIP DID RUN AGROUND THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FACT AND FICTION 
IN THE FICTIONAL VERSION STOKER HAD 
THE CAPTAIN DEAD LASHED TO THE 
STEERING WHEEL CLUTCHING HIS CREWS 
FIX AND ROSARY IN REAL LIFE THE 
CAPTAIN WAS CHARGED WITH BEING 
DRUNK AND DISORDERLY IN CHARGE OF A 
VESSEL 
WHERE DID IT COME FROM IN VESSEL IN THE BLACK SEA BOAT IN THE BOOK IN 
VARNA IN REAL LIFE IT WAS NARNA 
WHAT WAS THE SHIP CALLED DEMEETRY DEMEETRY HE'S PLAYING GAMES WITH US BRAM 
STOKER 
VERY MUCH SO STOKER AMONG THESE HOUSES AND COBBLED 
STREETS STOKER NOT ONLY FOUND KEY 
LOCATIONS FOR HIS HORROR STORY HE 
FOUND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OF 
ALL ALL AND HE FOUND IT RIGHT HERE IN WHAT 
IS NOW MODERN WATER FRONT BAR 
IN HIS TIME IT WAS WHITBY'S LIBRARY 
AND THE PLACE WHERE HE SPENT HOURS 
READING READING IN HIS HEAD STOKER HAD A GREAT 
STORY THE PERFECT SETTING AND A 
SINISTER CHARACTER IN THE SHAPE OF 
THE COUNTY AT FIRST HE CALLED THE 
COUNT WAMPIA THEN ONE DAMP 
AFTERNOON SITTING IN THIS PLACE 
READING AN OLD HAD I SAY TERRY OF 
ROMANIA HE CAME ACROSS THIS 
SENTENCE SENTENCE THE KING OF HUNGARY PREPARING TO 
MAKE WAR AGAINST THE TURKS ENGAGED 
DRACULA TO FORM AN ALLIANCE WITH 
HIM HIM IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT STOKER 
HAD EVER SEEN THE NAME DRACULA AND 
THE AUTHOR'S FOOT NOT DRACULA 
MEANS DEVIL IN AN INSTANT COUNTY 
WAMPIA BECAME COUNTY DRACULA 
IT WAS A LUCKY CHANCE AND IT 
HAPPENED HERE IN 
EERIE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE 
AVUNCULAR OR EVIL THERE'S SOMETHING 
IN THE EYES WHO'S YOUR FAVOURITE 
DRACULA FILM 
THE COUNT FROM SESAME 
STREET STREET ONE A HA AHA 
YOU HAVE FAVOURITE 
THE REASON 
DRACULA SURVIVES SO WELL IS THAT 
HE'S AN ENORMOUS THEATRICAL 
CHARACTER BRAM STOKER WORKED FOR A 
GREAT VICK TOERPBL ACTOR MY 
FAVOURITE DRACULA IN THE CINEMA WAS 
BELA LUGOSI A HUNGARIAN ACTOR AND 
ENORMOUS STAR IN THE TWENTIES AND THIRTIES 
PURE THEATRE ON THE SILVER SCREEN 
I AM DRACULA 
I BID YOU WELCOME 
HOPE HE DIDN'T FOLLOW THEM UP THOSE 
STAIRS 
WONDERFUL MAN DRACULA STAIRS DRACULA ALWAYS COUNT BUT NEVER COULD 
AFFORD A CLEANER 
AND YOUR FAVOURITE BOOK IS WINNIE 
THE POOH 
INDEED INDEED 
A LOT LESS VAMPIRES IN THERE 
UNLESS I'VE NOT READ ONE FULLY 
WOULD YOU SHAKE MY HAND L. KNEW THE 
REAL CHRISTOPHER ROBIN YOU'RE THE 
SHAKING THE HAND THAT SHOOK THE 
HAND THAT HELD THE PAW OF WINNIE 
THE POOH 
GOOD LORD NO BATH FOR ME TONIGHT 
YOU WENT BACK TO FROM WHERE SIR 
WINNIE THE POOH CAME 
WE CAN SEE YOU PLAYING POOH STICKS 
THERE YOU 
THAT'S WHERE IT HAPPENED ON POOH 
BRIDGE 
JUST BEFORE I JUMPED BRIDGE WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU COME ACROSS ALL ALL OVER THE U. K. THERE ARE AMAZING 
PLACES THAT HAVE INSPIRED AUTHORS 
CHILDREN'S AUTHORS ADULT AUTHORS 
I'M GOING TO GO OIR PLACES THE 
MIDDLE OF BIRMINGHAM INSPIRED JRR 
TOBLGEN TO GIVE US LORD OF THE 
RINGS 
IT WASN'T THE BUT RING RINGS EXACTLY ONE OF THE TOWERS THAT 
APPEARS IN LORD OF THE RINGS WE'RE 
GOING TO HENLEY DO YOU LIKE TOWED 
HE COMES FROM HENLEY L. MEET ONE 
DESCENDANTS OF THE REAL MR. TOWED 
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY I'M SURE THERE 
ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PLACES NEAR 
THEM THEM EXACTLY ON THAT NOTE IF YOU KNOW 
OF A BOOK INSPIRED BY YOUR TOWN 
IN TOUCH WITH US 
ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST 
CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES ANNOUNCED 
TODAY IT WAS BANNING BRICKIES FROM 
WOLF WHISTLING AT WOMEN FROM THIS 
SUNDAY PUB LANDLORDS AND OTHER 
CUSTOMERS WHO PUBLICANS WHO LET 
CUSTOMERS HAVE CHAUVINIST CHAT UP 
JOKES COULD BE PROSECUTED 
WOLF WHISTLE IT CAN ALL GET A BIT 
TIRING BUT WHAT USED TO BE A 
HARMLESS YET SOMETIMES ANNOYING 
COMMENT COULD LAND YOU WITH A 
LAWSUIT ESPECIALLY SO IF YOU'RE A 
MANAGER IN A BAR RESTAURANT OR 
HOTEL UNDER NEW LEGISLATION 
EMPLOYERS COULD FIND THEMSELVES 
BEFORE AN INDUSTRIAL TRIBUNAL FOR 
FAILING TO PROTECT THEIR STAFF FROM 
HARASSMENT BY CUSTOMERS THAT COULD 
MEAN PAYING OUT UNLIMITED DAMAGES 
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT FOR 
EXAMPLE COME HERE OFTEN LOVE THE 
SHIRT DARLING IF AN EMPLOYEE CAN 
PROVE SHE WAS HURT OR UPSET BY 
BEING CALLED LOVE OR DARLING 
REPEATEDLY IT MIGHT BE ENOUGH TO 
WIN COMPENSATION SUSY BENNETT IS A 
NEW STAND UP COMIC WITH A NEW LAW 
MIGHT BE LEASED WITH WHAT'S IN HER 
ROUTINE YOU NEVER KNOW WHO YOU 
MIGHT UPSET 
I SEE SEXIST JOKES AS 
A BIT OF FRIENDLY BANTER IT'S JUST 
FLIRTING IT'S NICE I THINK WHEN 
MEN CALL YOU LOVE BUT NOT IN A 
PATRONISING WAY 
SOME PEOPLE WOULD 
SAY BAR STAFF NEED TO BE PROTECTED 
IT DEPENDS HOW YOU LOOK AT IT IF 
YOU GO THROUGH LIFE AND LAUGH 
THINGS OFF VERY OFTEN I TAKE THE 
MICKEY OUT OF MY APPEARANCE AND 
WEIGHT IT'S SOMETHING TO LAUGH AT 
THERE'S TOO MUCH IN THE WORLD TO 
WORRY ABOUT IF SOMEBODY CALLS YOU 
HONEY BUN 
DO PEOPLE REALLY FIND 
PUB BANTER OFFENSIVE 
I WOULDN'T 
MIND 
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MIND IT IT'S PART AND PARCEL OF THE PUB 
LIFE AND IF THEY DON'T LIKE IT 
DON'T WORK THERE 
YOU HAVE TO JUDGE THE SITUATION IF 
YOU'RE WITH MATES AND IT'S GREAT 
IF THE ATMOSPHERE FEELS GOOD O. K. 
IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE 
MANAGER TO LOOK OUT FOR THEIR STAFF 
I WOULD NEVER GET UPSET ABOUT IT 
IT'S GENERALLY MEANT IN A NICE WAY 
TO GET UPSET ABOUT IT WOULD SAY 
MORE ABOUT YOU THAN THEM 
LUCY SIEGLE IS HERE THERE IS A 
SERIOUS PROBLEM IT IS TRYING TO 
SOLVE OR STOP WHICH IS SEXUAL 
HARASSMENT WHICH IS WRONG BUT 
WHAT IS THE LAW SAYING 
FROM SUNDAY 
THE ONUS IS ON THE EMPLOYER OR THE 
PERSON WHO MANAGES THE BUSINESS TO 
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY THAT THEIR 
STAFF ARE NOT SEXUALLY HARASSED SO 
THE EMPLOYEE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE OUT 
A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE EMPLOYER IT 
PUTS THE BALL IN THEIR COURT THAT 
THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT'S A SAFE 
WORKING ENVIRONMENT FREE OF SEXUAL 
HARASSMENT IT IS IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE THERE IS SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND WOMEN WHO 
WORK IN THE HOTEL AND CATERING 
TRADE WHO ARE NOT REALLY BEING 
LOOKED AFTER OR COVERED IN THAT 
WAY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT NOT NOT THAT I WOULD BUT IF I CALLED THE 
BARMAID IN MY LOCAL THREE TIMES IN 
ONE WEEK AND SHE OBJECTED TO THAT 
THEN SHE WOULD HAVE A GO AT ME AND 
HER BOSS IF HER BOSS DID NOTHING 
TO HAVE A WORD WITH ME OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUSLY IT'S ABOUT PERSONAL TOLERANCE AND 
MOST PEOPLE WOULD NOT FIND THAT A 
PROBLEM IT IS A SORT OF THREE 
STRIKES AND YOU'RE OUT SHE WOULD 
HOPEFULLY SAY TO YOU SHE FOUND IT 
UNACCEPTABLENED THE FIRST TIME AND 
THEN THE MANAGER WOULD SAY IT THE 
SECOND TIME 
IT IS GOING TO BE 
DIFFICULT TO POLICE ALTHOUGH I 
HAVE FRIENDS IF THEY WALK PAST 
BUILDING SITES AND DON'T GET 
WHISTLED AT THERE IS AN ISSUE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK I GREW UP IN A 
PUB AND I'M A COMEDIAN SO YOU 
MIGHT THINK I HAVE A LOT TO SAY ON 
THIS 
I DON'T I THINK IT'S ONE OF 
THESE IT WILL BE SO DIFFICULT TO 
ENFORCE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT AN 
ATMOSPHERE WHERE THERE IS ALCOHOL 
AND VERY CROWDED ATMOSPHERE THERE THERE IS A LOT OF NONSENSE TALKED AT THE 
BEST OF TIMES 
IT IS EASY TO APPLY 
IN A SMALL PUB HOW DO YOU ENFORCE 
THAT IN A NIGHTCLUB WITH PEWSIC L. 
DON'T SEE HOW IT WILL BE 
ENFORCEABLE WHENEVER THIS COMES 
OUT THE MEDIA JUMP ALL OVER IT AND 
THEN THERE IS A MASSIVE REACTION 
YOU LOSE THE SERIOUS PURPOSE TO IT 
THERE IS SERIOUS PURPOSE ABSOLUTELY 
PHIL YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CHAMPIONING THE NINETEEN NINETIES IN A SERIES 
CALLED WHEN WERE WE FUNNIEST WHAT 
IS SO SPECIAL 
A LOT OF THE THINGS 
IN THE EIGHTIES IT CHANGED A LOT 
PRETTY MUCH IT GOT A BIT OF A 
POLITICAL EDGE BUT THEN I THINK 
WHAT WAS INTERESTING THAT HAPPENED 
IN THE NINETIES WAS ALL THE FREEDOMS 
STARTED TO BE PUT INTO PRACTICE 
MORE AND NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF 
EDITORIAL CONTENT BUT ALSO PEOPLE 
JUST GOT AL BIT FUNNIER THERE WAS 
VIC AND BOB AND STEVE COOGAN HERE HERE IS ONE THAT EVERYBODY HAS BEEN IN A 
SIM SITUATION 
HERE'S TO OUR FUTURE 
RELATIONSHIP AT THE B. B. C.

ANY OTHER IDEAS I WOULD BE VERY 
INTERESTED 
GOT THEM HERE ALAN INTERESTED ATTACK LIKE THE COOK REPORT YOUTH 
HOSTELLING WITH CHRIS EUBANK NO NO MONKEY TENNIS

THE EDINBURGH FESTIVAL THAT I WROTE

A TASTE AND THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE IT 
A GO TRYING IT OUT WITH SOMEONE 
ELSE'S WORDS TO LEARN WILL THAT 
STANDUP WHERE YOU 
DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT IS GOING TO 
BE FUNNY 
IT IS MORE DIFFICULT 
BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE 
RELYING ON WHAT YOU SAY AND GO YOU 
HAVE GOT TO BE THERE FOR THE CAST 
AS WELL IT'S A BIT TRICKIER WITH 
THE STANDUP YOU ARE A LONE GUNMAN 
DOING WHAT YOU WANT

COME ON FANTASTIC FANTASTIC HOW WOULD YOU LIKE THESE AS YOUR 
BACKING BAND 
I WAS BETTER LOOKING 
THAN THE OTHER LADS FABULOUS FABULOUS THANK YOU VERY MUCH EARLIER WE 
TOLD YOU HOW WHITBY WAS THE 
INSPIRATION FOR BRAM STOKER'S 
DRACULA THE BATS WERE THE REAL 
STARS OF THAT BOOK DAVE OUR PROPS 
MAN IS THE REAL STAR OF THIS SHOW 
HE WAS NUMBER FIVE BY THE WAY 
ALL RIGHT DON'T BUILD YOUR PART 
OFF YOU GO DAVE THAT IS ENOUGH 
NOW BACK TO BATS YES IN REALITY 
THE SPECIES HAS TAKEN A BATTERING 
IN THE PAST FEW YEARS BUT AS WE 
HAVE DISCOVERED ONE VARIETY WHICH 
LOOKED TO BE ON ITS WAY OUT IS NOW 
CLING ING TO THE CEILING AGAIN WITH 
THE BEST OF THEM WELCOME TO THE 
BRECON BEACONS NATIONAL PARK YOU 
WOULD THINK WITH ALL THE OPEN SPACE 
THAT WILD ANIMALS WOULD DO ANYTHING 
TO AVOID THE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE 
LIVE BUT THERE IS ONE PARTICULAR 
SPECIES THAT IS DOING REALLY WELL 
IN THE FORGOTTEN CORNERS OF OUR 
BUILDINGS IN THE DARK PLACES THAT 
WE LEAVE BEHIND 
LIKE SOMETHING FROM A GOTHIC TALE 
FOR HALF THE YEAR BEHIND THE 
BRICKED UP WINDOWS AND LOCKED DOORS 
A THRONG OF UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED OF OUR RAREST 
MAMMALS LIVES HIDDEN IN THE ATIC 
IT'S THE LESSER HORSESHOE BAT THE 
NAME COMES FROM THE U. H. P. SHAPED 
FLESHY NOSE LEAF WHICH HELPS THEM 
LOCATE INSECTS WITH ULTRA SOUND 
THE LOCATION HAS TO REMAIN SECRET 
AS THE TOP FLOOR HAS BEEN CONVERTED 
INTO A STATE OF THE ART BAT ROOST 
BY THE VINCENT WILDLIFE TRUST 
THEY'VE SPENT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND BRICKING UP 
WINDOWS SOUND PROOFING FLOORS AND 
RESTORING THE ROOF MAKING THIS A 
PERFECT BAT FRIENDLY HANGOUT JOHN 
IS ONE OF THE EXPERTS AND HAS 
AGREED TO TAKE ME ON ONE OF HIS 
REGULAR ROOST INSPECTIONS BATS ARE 
SO VULNERABLE IT'S ILLEGAL TO 
HANDLE THEM UNLESS YOU ARE LICENCED 
AND THAT CAN TAKE MORE THAN TWO 
YEARS OF TRAINING THE ONLY REASON 
I'M ALLOWED INSIDE IS BECAUSE THE 
BATS ARE NOT HERE THIS COLONY USED 
TWO ROOSTS THIS ONE IN THE SUMMER 
FOR BREEDING OOND A COOLER ONE 
NEARBY TO HIBERNATE BUT BATS DON'T 
ALWAYS STICK TO THE RULES AND 
THAT ONE MUST BE HIBERNATING BUT 
INSIDE THE BUILDING WHERE THE 
TEMPERATURE GOES UP AND DOWN DURING 
THE DAY THAT IS QUITE UNUSUAL IS IS THAT THE NOSE LEAF 
YEAH JUST 
STICKING UP BETWEEN THE WINGS IT IT IS ALMOST LIKE A SATELLITE DISH IT IT IS A BIT 
BRINGING IN THE ECHO 
LOCATION SOUNDS 
THEY MAKE THEIR 
NOISES THROUGH THEIR NOSTRILS IT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS ONE IS SPENDING THE 
WINTER AWAY FROM THE COLONY THE 
REST ARE IN A VICTORIAN ICE HOUSE 
BEHIND THE SUMMER ROOST ICE HOUSES 
WERE SPECIAL VAULTED CELLARS USED 
BEFORE MODERN REFRIGERATION POOR 
JOHN IS LADEN DOWN WITH KIT THE 
CAMERAS AND EVERYTHING HE SEES 
INSIDE THERE IS GOING TO BE RELAYED 
BACK TO ME ON THIS WIRE SO WE CAN 
SEE IT ON THE MONITOR WE NEED TO 
KEEP THE RISK OF DISTURBANCE TO AN 
ABSOLUTE MINIMUM JOHN IS SPECIALLY 
TRAINED AND GOING IN BY HIMSELF 
WOW WE HAVE A WHOLE GROUP HERE 
PEOPLE TEND TO THINK OF IT AS BEING 
TYPICAL THAT BATS HANG UPSIDE DOWN 
BUT THE BRITISH BATS AT LEAST IT IS 
MUCH MORE COMMON FOR THEM TO ROOST 
INSIDE CREVICES LOOK AT THIS THIS 
IS UNBELIEVABLE THIS IS THE BAT 
CAVE THIS IS BAT CENTRAL WE ARE 
LOOKING AT A REALLY SIGNIFICANT 
PORTION OF OUR NATION'S LESSER 
HORSESHOE BATS THERE JOHN IS 
SWITCHING TO THE THERMAL IMAGING 
CAMERA MOST OF THE BATS ARE DEEP 
IN HIBERNATION BUT SOME WAKE UP 
AND HUNT AND THOSE ARE THE ONES 
THAT ARE GLOWING BRIGHTEST ON THE 
OFF CHANCE ONE MAY LEAVE THE ROOST 
WE HAVE DECIDED TO STICK AROUND 
UNTIL DUSK THAT WEIRD SOUND YOU 
CAN HEAR IS THE ECHO LOCATION 
CLICKS OF THE BATS AS THEY COME OUT 
YOU CAN JUST SEE THEM DARTING IN 
AND OUT OF THE DOOR HERE JOHN HAS 
BOT A DETECTOR THAT PICKS UP THE 
SOUND THERE GOES ONE THEY 
CERTAINLY SEEM TO BE WAKING UP HOW 
MANY DO YOU RECKON ARE ALL ACTIVE 
NOW 
IT'S A COLD NIGHT NOT MANY NOW INSECTS SO I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT 
THERE WOULD BE THAT MANY IT SOUNDS 
LIKE THERE ARE TEN 
I'VE HAD ONE OF 
MY BEST BAT DAYS IN THE U. K. THIS 
REALLY IS ONE OF OUR RAREST MAMMALS 
THE REASON THAT THERE ARE SO MANY 
OF THEM HERE IS DOWN TO THE WORK OF 
THE TRUST HOPEFULLY LOOK AT THAT 
ONE HOPEFULLY SIGHT LIKE THESE 
WILL BE WITH US FOR MANY YEARS TO 
COME GEORGE MCGAVIN IS HERE OUR 
BUG MAN HE KNOWS ABOUT BAT AND WE 
HAVE JENNY A BAT HANDLER AND WHAT 
DO WE HAVE HERE 
ONE OF THE MOST 
BEAUTIFUL OF OUR U. K. BATS THE LONG 
ERRED BAT IT HAS THE MOST AMAZING 
FACE 
DOES WHAT IT SAYS ON THE TIN FACE YEAH BATS ARE AMAZING THEY ARE 
MUCH MALIGNED EVERYONE THINKS THEY 
FLY IN YOUR HAIR IT'S NOT TRUE 
THEY ARE INCREDIBLY USEFUL THEY 
EAT THOUSANDS OF INSECTS EVERY 
NIGHT THEY ARE ALL UNDER THREAT 
MAINLY BECAUSE OF HABITAT LOSS 
BUILDINGS BEING BLOCKED UP THEY THEY ARE SO PROTECTED THAT CAN CAUSE A 
PROBLEM 
THEY ARE THAT IS A PROBLEM PROBLEM IN A WAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T 
HANDLE THEM OR INTERFERE WITH THE 
ROOST IF YOU FIND ONE AND YOU TRY 
TO HAVE A BARN DEVELOPED YOU MIGHT 
THINK WE WON'T TELL ANYBODY ABOUT 
THIS BUT YOU SHOULD BECAUSE THERE 
ARE WAYS OF OVERCOMING THE PROBLEMS 
AND HAVING THE BATS AND THE 
BUILDINGS 
LOVELY BATS THEY ARE BUILDINGS PHIL YOU EVEN LOVE BATS YOU HAVE 
LOVED EVERYTHING TONIGHT ON THE 
SHOW 
ABSOLUTELY L. HAVE LOOSE SHOW INVOLVEMENT WITH VARIOUS TOPICS 
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER THIS IS 
TERRIBLE I FED BATS 
THERE IS 
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT 
I USED TO 
POLL BREAD UP IN THE AIR AND THROW 
IT UP 
THEY EAT INSECTS KNOW 
I KNOW THAT IS WHY A LOT OF BATS ARE ON 
THE ATKINSON
