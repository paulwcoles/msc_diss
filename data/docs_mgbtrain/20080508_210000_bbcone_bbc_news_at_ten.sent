FEAR THAT FIFTEEN MILLION PEOPLE ARE 
HOMELESS UNABLE TO ACCESS THE AID 
THAT IS ON OFFER THE SUPPLIES NOW 
BEING ALLOWED IN ARE JUST A TRICKLE 
AS THE AMERICANS WARN THAT VAST 
QUANTITIES ARE NEEDED 
WE ARE 
OUTRAGED BY THE SLOWNESS OF THE 
RESPONSE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF BURMA 
WE WILL BE REPORTING FROM BURMA ON 
THE STRUGGLE TO GET THE AID WHERE 
IT'S NEEDED 
ALSO TONIGHT 
THE HARDLINE CLERIC ABU QATADA IS

AND BORIS GETS RID OF TWO TOP 
OFFICIALS 
GOOD EVENING 
THE UNITED NATIONS HAS CRITICISED 
BURMA FOR TAKING TOO LONG TO ALLOW 
INTERNATIONAL AID INTO THE COUNTRY 
OFFICIALS FEAR THAT AS MANY AS FIFTEEN 
MILLION PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS AFTER 
THE CYCLONE STRUCK FIVE DAYS AGO 
AMERICA'S AMBASSADOR TO THE UN HAS 
DESCRIBED THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT'S 
STANCE AS OUTRAGEOUS THE B. B. C.'S 
PAUL DANAHAR IS IN SOUTHERN BURMA 
AND HE HAS SENT THIS REPORT 
THEY HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR HELP FOR 
SIX DAYS AND FOR THESE PEOPLE IT 
FINALLY CAME BUT UP TO ONE MILLION 
MORE ARE LEFT BEHIND LIVING WITH 
THE ROTTING CORPSES OF THE TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE KILLED BY THE 
CYCLONE THE SURVIVORS HAVE NO FOOD 
NO SHELTER NO CLEAN WATER AND ARE 
PERHAPS LOSING HOPE IF SOMETHING 
DOES NOT CHANGE SOON DISEASE WILL 
GET A GRIP ON THE REGION AND IF IT 
DOES IT WILL BE THE YOUNG AND THE 
SICK IT TAKES FIRST AND TIME IS 
RUNNING OUT WE ONLY HAVE ENOUGH 
FOOD FOR THIS MORNING STARTING 
THIS EVENING WE DO NOT HAVE FOOD 
ANY MORE SHE SAID OUR WHOLE HOUSE 
WAS DESTROYED THE GENERALS ARE 
TRYING TO CONVINCE THEIR PEOPLE 
THEY ARE BUSY PLANNING A RESCUE 
THE REALITY IS THAT THE ONLY THING 
STOPPING MASSIVE AID GETTING TO THE 
NEEDY IS THE TIME TAKING FOR THESE 
MEN TO OPEN UP THE DOOR SO THOSE 
WHO CAN ARE HELPING THEMSELVES IN 
RANGOON MONKS BEGAN CLEARING AWAY 
THE DEBRIS STILL LITTERING THE 
STREETS ACROSS TOWN AT THE AIRPORT 
SOME AID HAD BEGUN TO TRICKLE IN 
BUT MUCH MUCH MORE IS STILL 
WAITING TO COME THE TRAGEDY OF 
THIS DISASTER MAY BE THAT PEOPLE 
DIED EVEN THOUGH THE MEANS TO SAVE 
THEM WAS THERE 
I DO FEEL I DO 
APPEAL VERY STRONGLY INDEED TO THE 
GOVERNMENT IN MYANMAR BUT TO STEP 
UP THEIR OWN EFFORTS TO HELP PEOPLE 
ON THE GROUND AND TO CHANGE THEIR 
ATTITUDE COMPLETELY TO THE EFFORTS 
THAT WE ARE MAKING TO GET THESE 
RELIEF SUPPLIES IN 
HUGE AREAS OF 
THE DELTA ARE STILL UNDER WATER 
ROADS ARE BLOCKED BRIDGES ARE DOWN 
AND THE GOVERNMENT RELIEF OPERATION 
HAS SO FAR BEEN PIECEMEAL AT BEST 
BUT TONIGHT WE SAW THE FIRST SIGNS 
OF A SIGNIFICANT ARMY PRESENCE IN 
THE DISASTER ZONE WE DROVE UNDER 
THE COVER OF DARKNESS TO THE TOWN 
OF BOGALAY DEEP INTO THE IRRAWADDY 
DELTA THE TOWN WAS SERIOUSLY 
DAMAGED BY THE CYCLONE AND IN 
PLACES THE STENCH OF DEATH HUNG IN 
THE AIR THIS IS AS FAR AS THE ROAD 
WILL TAKE YOU FROM HERE THE AID 
IS BEING LOADED ON TO SMALL BOATS 
AND TAKEN INTO THE FLOODED AREAS 
BUT WITH MORE THAN ONE MILLION PEOPLE 
TRAPPED BEYOND THIS POINT THE 
AMOUNT OF AID THAT IS COMING 
THROUGH AT THE MOMENT SIMPLY IS NOT 
ENOUGH ENOUGH AS WE HAVE HEARD A SMALL AMOUNT OF 
AID IS FINALLY BEING ALLOWED IN BUT 
WITHOUT MUCH GREATER CO OPERATION 
FROM THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES 
EMERGENCY SUPPLIES WILL BE TOO LATE 
FOR MANY OF THOSE IN NEED HERE TO 
ASSESS THE CHALLENGE OF GETTING THE 
BURMESE GENERALS TO CHANGE THEIR 
STANCE BRIAN HANRAHAN 
THIS IS ALL ABOUT SAVING THE 
SURVIVORS NOW AND THERE ARE THREE 
BIG OBSTACLES THE COLOSSAL SCALE 
OF THE CATASTROPHE THE HUGE 
LOGISTICAL TASK OF REACHING THE 
REGION AND THE RELUCTANCE OF THE 
BURMESE GOVERNMENT TO ACCEPT HELP 
THESE SATELLITE PHOTOS ARE PROBABLY 
STILL THE BEST ILLUSTRATION OF WHAT 
HAPPENED WHEN BURMA'S IRRAWADDY 
DELTA WAS STRUCK BY A CYCLONE 
DRIVING BEFORE IT A TWELVE F. T. WAVE 
WHICH INUNDATED TWO THOUSAND SQUARE MILES 
WITH SALT WATER THERE IS NO 
REALISTIC CASUALTY COUNT BUT IT IS 
FEARED AS MANY AS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 
HAVE DIED ALREADY THAT WOULD TAX 
THE RESOURCES OF ANY COUNTRY BUT 
BURMA IS REBUFFING OFFERS 
ESPECIALLY FROM THE U. S. TO USE ITS 
SHIPS PLANES AND HELICOPTERS TO 
HELP 
THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE HELP TO SAVE A LOT OF LIVES AND WE ARE 
FULLY PREPARED TO HELP AND TO HELP 
RIGHT AWAY AND IT WOULD BE A 
TRAGEDY IF THESE ASSETS IF PEOPLE 
DID NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM 
BURMA IS ALLOWING RELIEF FLIGHTS 
FROM CHINA INDIA AND INDONESIA 
COUNTRIES IT CONSIDERS SYMPATHETIC 
BUT ACROSS ITS BORDER IN BANGLADESH 
AND THAILAND FOOD SHIPMENTS ARE 
PILING UP WAITING FOR APPROVAL TO 
MOVE OFF THE COAST THE U. S. AND 
FRANCE SAY THEY HAVE NAVAL VESSELS 
READY TO ASSIST BUT THEY ARE BEING 
IGNORED THE B. B. C.'S CORRESPONDENTS 
ARE WATCHING WHAT IS HAPPENING 
THERE ARE BOXES OF AID SUPPLIES 
SITTING HERE IN BANGLADESH WAITING 
TO BE FLOWN INTO BURMA THE W. F. P. HAS 
ORGANISED THE SHIPMENT THEY SAY 
THEY HAVE RECEIVED PERMISSION FROM 
THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES SO SOME 
TIME THIS EVENING THESE CRATES WILL 
BE LOADED ON TO AN AEROPLANE AND 
FLOWN DOWN INTO RANGOON BUT NOT 
EVERYTHING IS GOING THE WAY OF THE 
AID AGENCIES MANY HERE SAY THEY 
HAVE ASKED FOR VISAS FOR THEIR 
STAFF TO BE SENT DOWN TO BURMA BUT 
STILL THERE WAITING FOR THOSE VISA 
APPLICATIONS TO BE APPROVED BY THE 
EMBASSY EMBASSY THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES WHERE 
AID IS COMING FROM TWO TRANSPORT 
PLANES LEFT JAKARTA CARRYING FOOD 
TENTS AND MEDICINE FOR THE CYCLONE 
VICTIMS WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE IN NEED BURMA IS TURNING 
NOT TO THE UN BUT TO FRIENDLY 
COUNTRIES LIKE THIS JAKARTA HAS 
ALWAYS BEEN CAREFUL NOT TO 
CRITICISE BURMA TOO HARSHLY AND 
NOW THIS IS WHERE BURMA IS TURNING 
FOR HELP 
BRITAIN'S MAJOR AID ORGANISATIONS 
HAVE LAUNCHED A JOINT APPEAL 
TONIGHT THROUGH THE DISASTERS 
EMERGENCY RELIEF COMMITTEE BUT 
GIVEN THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING AID 
INTO BURMA CAN THEY BE SURE THAT 
IT WILL REACH THE RIGHT PEOPLE I I CAN GIVE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCES ON 
THAT GIVEN THAT SAVE THE CHILDREN 
AND OTHER AGENCIES HAVE BEEN IN 
BURMA FOR MANY YEARS WE HAVE 
THOUSANDS OF STAFF VOLUNTEERS ON 
THE GROUND AT SAVE THE CHILDREN 
ALONE WE HAVE BEEN OUT IN THE LAST 
FEW DAYS AND REACHED SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
WITH LIFE SAVING FOOD WATER 
PLASTIC SHEETING BASIC SHELTER 
BUT IT IS SIX DAYS SINCE THE 
CYCLONE STRUCK AND THE RELIEF 
OPERATION HAS BARELY DID BARELY 
BEGUN BURMA'S GENERALS ARE BEING 
URGED NOT TO STAND BACK AND LET 
THEIR PEOPLE DIE BUT THEY HAVE 
LONG RECORD OF DISREGARDING 
INTERNATIONAL OPINION 
THE AID AGENCIES ARE APPEALING FOR 
HELP THEY SAY THEY NEED IS 
IMMEDIATE AND VAST THERE ARE FULL 
DETAILS OF HOW TO CONTRIBUTE ON OUR 
WEBSITE 
THE RADICAL MUSLIM PREACHER ABU 
QATADA HAS BEEN GRANTED BAIL BY AN 
IMMIGRATION TRIBUNAL PART OF THE 
BAIL HAS BEEN PAID BY NORMAN KEMBER 
THE BRITON WHO WAS RELEASED FROM 
CAPTIVITY IN IRAQ LAST YEAR QATADA 
HAS ALREADY WON HIS APPEAL AGAINST 
BEING DEPORTED TO JORDAN WHERE HE 
IS WANTED FOR TERRORISM OFFENCES 
THE HOME SECRETARY SAID SHE WAS 
EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED BY THE 
DECISION AS DANIEL SANDFORD 
REPORTS REPORTS HIS SERMONS WERE FOUND IN A NINE ELEVEN 
HIJACKER'S FLAT HE HAS BEEN 
DESCRIBED BY SPANISH JUDGE AS BIN 
LADEN'S RIGHT HAND MAN IN EUROPE 
BUT ABU QATADA OMAR OTHMAN TO 
GIVE HIM HIS REAL NAME HAS NEVER 
BEEN CONVICTED IN BRITAIN AND TODAY 
A COURT GRANTED HIM BAIL IN 
REALITY IT WILL BE MORE LIKE TWENTY TWO 
HOURS HOUSE ARREST BUT IT HAS 
CAUSED DISMAY IN THE HOME OFFICE 
WHILE IN PRISON ABU QATADA 
APPEALED FOR THE RELEASE OF THE 
BRITISH HOSTAGE NORMAN KEMBER WHO 
WAS BEING HELD IN IRAQ AND NOW 
NORMAN KEMBER HAS RETURNED THE 
FAVOUR HE IS ONE OF A GROUP OF 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE OFFERED TO PUT UP 
MONEY TO SECURE QATADA'S BAIL 
TONIGHT THERE WAS NOTHING THE HOME 
SECRETARY JACQUI SMITH COULD DO 
EXCEPT ISSUE A STRONG STATEMENT 
SAYING SHE IS EXTREMELY 
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE COURT'S 
DECISION TO GRANT ABU QATADA BAIL 
SHE GOES ON TO SAY SHE WILL BE 
DOING EVERYTHING NECESSARY TO 
PROTECT THE PUBLIC IT IS ANOTHER 
TWIST IN A LONG SAGA ABU QATADA 
WAS FIRST WANTED FOR DETENTION IN 
TWO THOUSAND ONE BUT WENT ON THE RUN BEFORE 
BEING CAPTURED NINE MONTHS LATER 
TWO YEARS AFTER THAT THE LAW LORDS 
RULED THAT HIS DETENTION WITHOUT 
TRIAL WAS UNLAWFUL SO NEXT THE 
HOME OFFICE ARRESTED HIM FOR 
DEPORTATION BUT THAT IS NOW ALSO 
IN TROUBLE WITH THE COURTS AND HE 
IS ABOUT TO BE BAILED 
IN AN IDEAL 
WORLD WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO BRING 
ABU QATADA TO JUSTICE IN THIS 
COUNTRY IF HE IS INDEED GUILTY OF 
SOME OF THE ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE 
BEEN LEVELLED AGAINST HIM THIS IS 
WHY WE HAVE ARGUED FOR SOME YEARS 
THAT WE SHOULD BE USING EVERY TOOL 
AT OUR DISPOSAL TO DEAL WITH SUCH 
PEOPLE DOMESTICALLY AND IN 
PARTICULAR IF NECESSARY USING 
INTERSECT EVIDENCE 
THERE ARE 
FRIENDS OF ABU QATADA WHO ARE GLAD 
HE IS BEING BAILED 
I SEE HIM AS A 
PERSON THAT HE PREACHES FOR HIS OWN 
PEOPLE TO LIBERATE HIS OWN PEOPLE 
AND TO BRING JUSTICE TO HIS OWN 
PEOPLE 
FOR NOW HE IS STILL IN PEOPLE LONG LARTIN PRISON IN 
WORCESTERSHIRE BUT NEXT WEEK THE 
SAME TRIBUNAL THAT ONCE DESCRIBED 
HIM AS A TRULY DANGEROUS INDIVIDUAL 
IS LIKELY TO GIVE HIM SOME VERY 
LIMITED FREEDOM

JOSEF FRITZL THE AUSTRIAN MAN WHO 
IMPRISONED AND RAPED HIS DAUGHTER 
FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS HAS TOLD HIS LAWYER 
THAT HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS AN ADDICTION 
HIS COMMENTS HAVE BEEN LEAKED TO A 
LOCAL MAGAZINE HE CLAIMS HE IS NOT 
THE BEAST DESCRIBED BY THE MEDIA 
BUT A MAN WHO TRIED HIS BEST TO 
CARE FOR HIS FAMILY 
HIS CRIME HAS SHOCKED THE WORLD 
NOW JOSEF FRITZL HAS SPOKEN OUT 
ABOUT HIS SECRET CELLAR AND HIS 
VICTIMS THIS AUSTRIAN WEEKLY HAS 
PUBLISHED HIS FIRST COMMENTS 
PASSED ON FROM PRISON BY HIS LAWYER 
HE BEGINS BY TALKING ABOUT HIS PAST 
THIS IS JOSEF FRITZL IN A SCHOOL 
PHOTO JUST AFTER THE SECOND WORLD 
WAR HIS FATHER LEFT HOME WHEN HE 
WAS FOUR HE WAS RAISED BY A STRICT 
MOTHER IN AUTHORITARIAN AUSTRIA 
BUT WHY DID HE LOOK AWAY ELISABETH 
HIS OWN DAUGHTER FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS 
LOCK AWAY FROM HIS PRISON CELL 
THIS BIZARRE ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN AN 
INCOMPREHENSIBLE CRIME 
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS DEEP IN HIS 
CELLAR FRITZL SEXUALLY ABUSED HIS 
DAUGHTER AND FATHERED HER SEVEN 
CHILDREN NOW HIS FIRST TWISTED 
IMPRESSIONS OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO 
BE THERE GAOLER 
THESE COMMENTS RELEASED BY HIS 
LAWYER LOOK LIKE AN ATTEMPT TO 
SOFTEN THE JOSEF FRITZL'S IMAGE TO 
BETRAY HIM AS A HUMAN BEING AND NOT 
A MONSTER PORTRAY HIM 
TODAY THE 
QUESTIONING LASTED ABOUT AN HOUR 
AND A HALF WE TALKED ABOUT HIS 
PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL 
BACKGROUND HE WAS NOT QUESTIONED 
ON THE CASE ITSELF 
AS FOR THE 
PEOPLE OF AMSTETTEN THEY ARE STILL 
EMBARRASSED AND ANGRY THAT ONE MAN 
HERE COULD BRING SO MUCH SHAME ON 
THEIR TOWN AND SO MUCH SUFFERING TO 
HIS OWN FAMILY 
POLICE FORCES IN ENGLAND AND WALES 
HAVE BEEN ASKED TO GIVE GANGS AND 
THUGS A TASTE OF THEIR OWN MEDICINE 
IT IS THE HOME SECRETARY'S LATEST 
IDEA TO TACKLE ANTI SOCIAL 
BEHAVIOUR SHE SAYS PEOPLE WHO 
HARASS COMMUNITIES SHOULD FIND 
THEMSELVES HARASSED IT COMES ON 
THE DAY THAT NEW FIGURES SHOW THAT 
NEARLY HALF OF ALL ANTI SOCIAL 
BEHAVIOUR ORDERS HAVE BEEN BREACHED 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS KEPT 
INTEREST RATES AT FIVE PER CENT IT HAD BEEN 
EXPECTED BECAUSE RISING FOOD AND 
FUEL PRICES ARE PUSHING UP 
INFLATION ANALYSTS EXPECT A 
QUARTER POINT CUT NEXT MONTH 
A BOY WHO SUFFERED BRAIN DAMAGE 
AFTER HE WAS KICKED IN THE HEAD 
WHILE PLAYING A BOUNCY CASTLE HAS 
WON HIS CLAIM FOR DAMAGES SAM 
HARRIS ELEVEN AT THE TIME SUFFERED A 
FRACTURED SKULL THE JUDGE RULED 
THAT THE COUPLE WHO HAD RENTED THE 
INFLATABLE HAD FAILED TO SUPERVISE 
THEIR CHILDREN ADEQUATELY 
THEIR CHILDREN 
THEY HAVE BECOME THE MUST HAVE 
ACCESSORY AT PARTIES ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY PLAYING ON A BOUNCY CASTLE 
LEFT SAM HARRIS PERMANENTLY 
DISABLED AND IT HAS LEFT THE COUPLE 
WHO HIDE IT WITH A BILL FOR DAMAGES 
THAT COULD RUN INTO HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF POUNDS THE BOUNCY 
CASTLE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS 
FIELD SAM HARRIS HAD BEEN PLAYING 
ON IT HAPPILY BUT THEN A BIGGER 
BOY GET ON EARTH GOT ON HE TRIED 
A SOMERSAULT AND ACCIDENTALLY 
KICKED SAM IN THE HEAD FRACTURING 
HIS SKULL AND CAUSING PERMANENT 
BRAIN DAMAGE THE INFLATABLE HAD 
BEEN RENTED BY TIMOTHY AND 
CATHERINE PERRY TODAY THE HIGH 
COURT RULED THEY WERE LIABLE FOR 
SAM HARRIS'S INJURIES BECAUSE THEY 
HAD FAILED TO SUPERVISE THE EVENT 
PROPERLY IN PARTICULAR THEY 
SHOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED THE BIGGER 
BOY ON TO THE BOUNCY CASTLE AT THE 
SAME TIME AS YOUNGER CHILDREN 
SAM'S MOTHER SAYS SHE HOPES LESSONS 
WILL BE LEARNT FROM WHAT HAPPENED 
JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE BIG AND SOFT 
AND BOUNCY AND ROUND AND THEY HAVE 
NO SHARP EDGES IT DOES NOT MEAN 
THEY CANNOT BE FATAL THEY DENIED 
SUPER LEAGUE THEY DO NEED 
SUPERVISING AT ALL TIMES 
IT IS 
ESTIMATED THAT UP TO TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE 
EVERY YEAR ARE INJURED USING BOUNCY 
CASTLES SAFETY CAMPAIGNERS SAY 
TODAY'S RULING COULD HAVE HUGE 
IMPLICATIONS FOR PARENTS AND OTHER 
ADULTS WHO STAGE EVENTS THAT 
INCLUDE THEM 
I THINK IT SENDS OUT 
A STRONG SIGNAL TO ANYBODY THINKING 
OF ORGANISING A CHILDREN'S PARTY 
WHERE THEY HAVE A BOUNCY CASTLE 
THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY 
ORGANISE IT PROPERLY AND THEY PUT 
THE RIGHT SAFETY MEASURES IN PLACE 
MAKE SURE YOU DON'T LET TOO MANY 
CHILDREN ON AT ONCE MAKE SURE THEY 
ARE OF A SIMILAR SIZE 
THE PARENTS 
AT THE CENTRE OF TODAY'S JUDGMENT 
HAVE BEEN GRANTED THE RIGHT OF 
APPEAL THE JUDGE SAID THAT WAS 
BECAUSE THE COURT'S DECISION HAD 
SUCH POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE TO 
ANYBODY OPERATING INFLATABLE 
EQUIPMENT EQUIPMENT THERE HAS BEEN A SECOND DAY OF 
FIGHTING ON THE STREETS OF BEIRUT 
RIVAL FACTIONS EXCHANGED GUNFIRE AS 
TENSIONS CONTINUED BETWEEN 
SUPPORTERS OF THE LEBANESE 
GOVERNMENT AND IRANIAN BACKED 
HEZBOLLAH THE VIOLENCE FOLLOWS A 
GOVERNMENT DECISION TO REMOVE A 
SENIOR SECURITY OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF 
HAVING LINKS TO HEZBOLLAH MILITANTS 
IS RARE OR HAS BEEN CELEBRATING THE 
SIXTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS CREATION 
WITH MILITARY DISPLAYS AND STREET 
PARTIES PARTIES ISRAEL SECURITY HAS BEEN 
INCREASED BECAUSE OF FEARS THAT 
PALESTINIAN MILITANTS MIGHT LAUNCH 
ATTACKS PALESTINIANS HAVE BEEN 
HOLDING SOLEMN MARCHES TO MARK WHAT 
THEY CALL THE CATASTROPHE OF THE 
FOUNDING OF THE JEWISH STATE 
ISRAEL HAS A LOT TO CELEBRATE THE 
AIRSHOW OVER TEL AVIV WAS FOR A 
STATE THAT HAS ABSORBED MILLIONS OF 
JEWISH REFUGEES AND IMMIGRANTS 
CREATING A HIGH TECH TAKE ECONOMY 
WHAT IT HAS NEVER HAD HIS PIECE 
IS PEACE THIS IS KIBBUTZ YAD 
MORDECHAI THE SIX MILLION DEAD FROM 
THE HOLOCAUST ARE PRESERVED IN THE 
KIBBUTZ MUSEUM THEY HAVE PRESERVED 
THE BATTLEFIELD WHERE THEY FOUGHT 
SOLDIERS FROM EGYPT 
HERE IN FRONT 
OF ME I HAVE NO BULLETS AND NO 
RIFLES TO REACH THEM L. NEEDED 
SOMETHING I WAS VERY VERY ANGRY 
MORE RECENTLY PALESTINIAN ROCKETS 
HAVE HIT THE KIBBUTZ ISRAELIS CAN 
FIELD CAN FEEL STRONG AND 
INSECURE AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE 
OF PLACES LIKE THIS A FEW MILES 
AWAY BEYOND ISRAEL'S BORDER 
DEFENCES IS GAZA ISRAELIS AND 
PALESTINIANS CAN HAVE LONG 
ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE CAUSES OF 
TODAY'S VIOLENCE AND THE VIOLENCE 
OF SIXTY YEARS BUT IF THEY WANT TO 
HAVE PEACE THEY NEED TO MAKE 
DEAL THAT MEANS CREATING A 
PALESTINIAN STATE ALONGSIDE ISRAEL 
AND DECIDING WHAT TO DO ABOUT 
JERUSALEM AND WHAT TO DO WITH 
PALESTINIAN REFUGEES THE KIND OF 
PEOPLE WHOSE FAMILIES USED TO LIVE 
NEAR YAD MORDECHAI AND NOW LIVING
