YOUR PETROL TANK COULD COME FROM 
FIELDS LIKE THIS BUT ARE BIOFUELS

AFTER THE NEWS WITH NICHOLAS OWEN 
GOOD AFTERNOON FIVE YOUNG BRITISH 
WOMEN HAVE BEEN KILLED IN A BUS 
CRASH IN ECUADOR THE FOREIGN 
OFFICE SAYS TWO TEENAGERS AND THREE 
WERE IN THEIR TWENTIES THE ACCIDENT 
HAPPENED BETWEEN THE CAPITAL QUITO 
AND THE COASTAL TOWN OF PUERTO 
LOPEZ LIVE NOW TO OUR 
CORRESPONDENT MIKE WOOLDRIDGE 
OUTSIDE THE ECUADORIAN EMBASSY IN 
LONDON WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW WELL WELL WITHIN THE LAST HOUR THE FOREIGN 
OFFICE HAS GIVEN THE NAMES OF THE 
FIVE BRITISH WOMEN WHO WERE KILLED 
TWELVE OTHER BRITISH NATIONALS WERE 
INJURED NOT PARTICULARLY SERIOUSLY 
INJURED AS FAR AS WE UNDERSTAND 
FROM THE COMPANY INVOLVED WHICH IS 
CALLED VENTURECO THERE WAS ALSO A 
FRENCH NATIONAL AND TWO ECUADORIANS 
THEY WERE ALL CLOSE TO THE END OF 
WHAT HAD BEEN A LONG JOURNEY DOWN 
FROM THE CAPITAL THERE ARE REALLY 
NO DETAILS OF THE ACTUAL 
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRASH BEYOND 
THE FACT THAT IT'S BELIEVED THAT 
THIS BUS WAS IN COLLISION WITH 
ANOTHER VEHICLE VENTURECO HAS BEEN 
IN OPERATION FOR YEARS AND THEY 
HAVE THIS AFTERNOON SENT THEIR 
SYMPATHIES TO ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE 
BEEN INVOLVED AND AFFECTED BY THIS 
CRASH CRASH A PARTIAL RECOUNT OF VOTES IN 
ZIMBABWE'S ELECTIONS IS TO TAKE 
PLACE FOLLOWING THE MEETING OF 
SOUTHERN AFRICAN LEADERS THE 
DECISION THOUGH HAS BEEN CONDEMNED 
BY THE OPPOSITION M. D. C. MOVEMENT 
WHICH SAYS IT WILL GO TO COURT TO 
TO CHALLENGE THE MOVE THE LEADERS' 
MEETING HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE THIS 
WEEKEND IN ZAMBIA FROM WHERE ALLAN 
LITTLE SENT THIS REPORT 
THAT THEY CAME AT ALL IS SIGN OF 
ONE THING THAT ZIMBABWE'S CRISIS IS 
A CRISIS FOR THEM ALL DRAGGING THE 
ENTIRE SOUTHERN AFRICAN REGION IN 
ITS DOWNWARD SPIRAL THE OPPOSITION 
M. D. C. CAME WITH HIGH HOPES THAT 
THESE THIRTEEN HEADS OF STATE WITH SPEAK 
WITH ONE VOICE AND TELL ROBERT 
MUGABE TO GO THEY DID NOT DO THAT 
THEY FELL FAR SHORT THEY WERE 
INSTEAD EVEN HANDED TELLING THE 
ZIMBABWE GOVERNMENT TO RELEASE THE 
RESULTS AND THE OPPOSITION TO 
RESPECT THEM 
VERIFICATION AND RELEASE OF RESULTS 
IN TIME IN ACCORDANCE WITH DUE 
PROCESS OF LAW 
IN ZIMBABWE THE BALLOT BOXES HAVE 
BEEN HIDDEN FROM VIEW FOR FOURTEEN DAYS 
THE OPPOSITION SAYS THAT MAKES AN 
UNCORRUPTED RESULT IMPOSSIBLE 
BECAUSE THE BALLOTS HAVE BEEN 
COOKED THE GOVERNMENT DEFENDED THE 
DELAY 
YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS 
HAPPY THAT'S WHY THERE ARE DAYS 
DELAYS 
THE HEADS OF STATE HERE DELAYS HAVE TOLD THE OPPOSITION THAT THEY 
SHOULD IF NECESSARY NOW GO INTO A 
SECOND ROUND RUNOFF AGAINST ROBERT 
MUGABE THE M. D. C. HAS ALREADY SAID IT 
WILL NOT DO THAT BECAUSE TO DO SO 
WOULD UNLEASH A WAVE OF VIOLENT 
INTIMIDATION INSTEAD SENIOR 
MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION ARE NOW 
TELLING MORGAN TSVANGIRAI THAT IT'S 
NO LONGER SAFE FOR HIM TO GO BACK 
TO ZIMBABWE AND HE SHOULD NOW SEEK 
ASYLUM IN NEIGHBOURING BOTSWANA 
THE HOME SECRETARY JACQUI SMITH 
SAYS BRITAIN FACE AS SWORE AND 
GROWING THREAT LEVEL IN AN 
INTERVIEW WITH A SUNDAY PAPER SHE 
SAID SECURITY SERVICES ARE 
INVESTIGATING THIRTY ACTIVE PLOTS SHE 
SAID IT WAS VITAL TO EXTEND THE 
ELECT OF EXTEND THE LENGTH OF 
TIME TERRORIST SUSPECTS CAN BE HELD 
WITHOUT CHARGE TO FORTY TWO DAYS 
KENYA'S MARTIN LEL HAS WON THE 
MEN'S RACE IN THE LONDON MARATHON 
IT TOOK HIM TWO HOURS FIVE MINUTES 
AND FIFTEEN SECONDS IT COULD SET A NEW 
RECORD 
THE GERMAN IRINA MIKITENKO RECORD WON THE WOMEN'S RACE 
THAT'S IT FOR 
NOW NOW IF YOU HAVE JUST RUN THE MARATHON 
YOU CAN LOOK AWAY NOW GO TO THE 
FRIDGE AND PULL OUT ANYTHING YOU 
FANCY BECAUSE THE CHANCES ARE YOU 
AREN'T PART OF BRITAIN'S BULGING 
OBESITY PROBLEM THE FIGURES ARE 
FRIGHTENING IN ENGLAND ALONE 
NEARLY A QUARTER OF MEN AND WOMEN 
ARE NOW CONSIDERED TO BE OBESE AND 
THE STATISTICS FOR CHILDREN ARE 
EVEN MORE WORRYING ACCORDING TO 
ONE GOVERNMENT REPORT BEING AN 
OVERWEIGHT NATION MIGHT BE COSTING 
A BUTTON POPPING SIXTEEN BILLION BUT 
WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS THIS THE 
GOVERNMENT'S OR OURS IN A MOMENT I 
WILL ASK THE HEALTH SECRETARY 
FIRST WE HAVE UNLEASHED TWO 
REPORTERS ON THE SAME SUBJECT 
GILLIAN HAR LEAVES HAR GROVES 
WILL BE MAKING THE CASE FOR 
FIGHTING FAT WHILE MAX COTTON 
FLIES THE FLAG FOR INDIVIDUAL 
RESPONSIBILITY 
WE ARE A NATION IN CRISIS IT'S AN 
ISSUE THE HEALTH SECRETARY SAYS IS 
AS IMPORTANT AS CLIMATE CHANGE 
THE PROBLEM WE ARE ALL GETTING 
FATTER ACCORDING TO THE 
GOVERNMENT'S OWN STATISTICS TWO 
THIRDS OF ADULTS AND ONE THIRD OF 
CHILDREN LIVING IN ENGLAND ARE 
EITHER OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE AND IT'S 
BROADLY THE SAME IN SCOTLAND AND 
THAT'S COSTING US ABOUT SIXTEEN BILLION 
A YEAR COME ON MAX 
I AM THE BIG BAD WOLF BECAUSE THE 
GOVERNMENT DEFINES ME AS BEING 
OBESE WHICH INCIDENTALLY I FIND 
PRETTY OFFENSIVE ANYWAY HOW IS IT 
ANYBODY'S BUSINESS THAT I CHOOSE TO 
LIVE ON CHEESE PIES 
I WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO INTERVENE 
TO STOP PEOPLE LIKE MAX EATING 
THEMSELVES INTO AN EARLY GRAVE AND AND I WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO LEAVE ME 
ALONE ALONE LET'S GET OUT OF THIS GEAR AND I AM 
GOING TO INTRODUCE TO YOU A MAN WHO 
WILL PUT THE FEAR OF GOD INTO YOU 
GOODY GOODY GOODY 
I AM TAKING MAX TO SEE A DOCTOR WHO 
IS AN EXPERT ON FAT 
WHY COULDN'T WE HAVE JUST TAKEN THE 
BUS 
BECAUSE MAX CYCLING IS GOOD BUS FOR US ALL THAT FRESH AIR AND 
EXERCISE 
YEAH IT IS AS LONG AS EXERCISE WE GET THERE ALIVE 
THIS IS THE ROYAL LONDON HOSPITAL 
MAX AND THIS IS THE MOMENT OF 
TRUTH TRUTH AT THIS HOSPITAL DOCTOR SIMON COPPACK 
HAS A SPECIAL MACHINE WHICH WILL 
MEASURE OUR BODY'S FAT CONTENT 
YOU HAVE DONE THE TESTS WHAT'S THE 
VERDICT 
FOR YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THE VERDICT BODY MASS INDEX THE B. M. I. THAT'S 
THE GOVERNMENT'S PREFERRED MEASURE 
OF HOW OBESE YOU ARE YOU ARE VERY 
GOOD A LOW B. M. I. YOU ARE A SLENDER 
LADY THE TEST THAT YOU DID ALSO 
LOOKED AT YOUR BODY COMPOSITION IT 
LOOKED AT HOW MUCH OF YOU IS SOLID 
MUSCLE AND HOW MUCH OF YOU IS FAT 
TISSUE AND ON THAT YOU ARE NOT 
QUITE SO MUSCULAR YOU ARE PERHAPS 
MORE MORE ADIPOSE TISSUE IN THAT 
SENSE PERHAPS YOU ARE NOT QUITE AS 
HEALTHY AS YOUR LOW B. M. I. MIGHT 
SUGGEST 
WHAT ABOUT ME COMPLETELY SUGGEST COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS I AM DIFFERENT OBESE 
WELL THE GOVERNMENT'S OBESE TECHNICALLY RIGHT YOUR B. M. I. YOU 
ARE TOO HEAVY BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT 
HOW YOUR BODY COMPOSITION ACTUALLY 
YOU ARE NO WHERE NEAR AS BOD YOUR 
FAT CONTENT IS HIGH BUT NO WHERE 
NEAR THAT AND NORMAL IN FACT 
AVERAGE FOR THAT L. SUSPECT WITH 
YOU YOU ARE QUITE SOLID YOU ARE 
MORE ACTIVE DO OUTDOORS AND YOU 
ARE MORE ACTIVE THAN MOST OF US 
ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT'S WORRIED 
ABOUT YOU AS A DOCTOR AS AN 
INDIVIDUAL PATIENT I WOULDN'T BE I I AM ALL MUSCLE 
I WOULDN'T SAY ALL 
MUSCLE BUT YOU ARE NOT AS BAD AS 
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE B. M. I. WOULD 
SUGGEST SUGGEST THAT WAS REVEALING YOU ARE NOT AS 
FAT AS YOU THOUGHT 
AND YOU MISS 
GOODY TWO SHOES ARE NOT AS THIN AS 
YOU THOUGHT DO YOU THINK HE 
THOUGHT I WAS A BODY BUILDER OR AN 
ATHLETE 
SURE HERE WE ARE MAX WE ATHLETE WE WILL BE ALL RIGHT THERE 
PATRICIA HEWITT YOU WERE THE HEALTH 
SECRETARY WHO ENCOURAGED G. P.'S TO 
PRESCRIBE GYMS ON THE N. H. S. YOU WERE 
THE PERSON WHO BANNED SMOKING IN 
PUBLIC PLACES DOES INTERVENTION 
WORK 
OF COURSE INTERVENTION WORKS WORK BUT IT'S GOT TO BE THE RIGHT KIND 
OF INTERVENTION L. MEAN ENCOURAGING 
G. P.'S TO PRESCRIBE GYMS IS ONE WAY OF 
MAKING IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE 
EXERCISE 
I DON'T 
GET IT I DON'T EXERCISE GET THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THEY SHOULD 
BE DOING THEY DON'T DO IT BECAUSE 
THEY'RE HUMAN BEINGS SO LOAF THEM 
ALONE LEAVE THEM ALONE 
WHAT YOU 
ARE POINTING TO IS THE FACT IT CAN 
BE REALLY DIFFICULT FOR ANYONE ELSE 
AS AN INDIVIDUAL TO MAKE CHANGES 
EVEN IF WE KNOW THOSE CHANGES ARE 
GOING TO BE GOOD FOR US ACTUALLY 
THAT'S THE BIG PUBLIC HEALTH 
CHALLENGE OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IN 
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IT WAS EASY WHAT 
YOU HAD TO DO WAS PUT IN CLEAN 
WATER AND SEWERS 
POVERTY WAS THE 
GREAT LEVELLER 
AND THE GREAT 
KILLER YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO CHANGE 
PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOUR YOU JUST HAD TO 
GIVE THEM CLEAN WATER DECENT 
SEWAGE AND MODERN HOUSING THESE 
DAYS ALL OF US HAVE TO TAKE SOME 
ELEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR 
OWN HEALTH AND THAT MEANS LOOKING 
TO GOVERNMENT NOT TO TELL US WHAT 
TO DO BUT TO SAY HERE IS A SPORTS 
FACILITY THAT YOU CAN AFFORD OR IF 
YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT WE WILL MAKE 
IT AVAILABLE ON PRESCRIPTION WHAT WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO IS TRYING TO 
CHANGE MY BEHAVIOUR ME AS AN 
INDIVIDUAL YOU JUST SAID IT YOU 
WANT TO CHANGE THE WAY I BEHAVE L. 
DON'T WANT TO SOUND DISRESPECTFUL 
I THINK HOW DARE YOU 
WELL YOU 
DECIDE WHAT TO DO IN THE CONDITIONS 
THAT SURROUND YOU IF THERE ISN'T A 
GYM NEAR YOU OR A GYM THAT YOU CAN 
AFFORD IF ACTUALLY YOU HAVE GROWN 
UP EATING A REALLY UNHEALTHY DIET 
IF YOUR CHILD GOES TO A SCHOOL THAT 
IS SERVING APPALLINGLY UNHEALTHY 
SCHOOL MEALS NONE NONE OF THAT IS 
GOING TO MAKE IT EASY YOU WON'T 
MAKE HEALTHY CHOICES YOU WILL MAKE 
UNHEALTHY CHOICES BECAUSE YOUR 
CIRCUMSTANCES DON'T MAKE HEALTHY 
CHOICES POSSIBLE 
I HAVE A BIT OF A 
PROBLEM BECAUSE ALL THIS FRENZIED 
ACTIVITY IS MAKING ME HUNGRY I I WILL BUY YOU LUNCH HOW ABOUT THAT 
AGAIN INTERVENTION THERE IS ONE 
REALLY DECENT ARGUMENT IT'S ABOUT 
FREEDOM NOW THEN SEAN WHAT ARE 
YOU HAVING 
I WILL HAVE THE VENISON 
CAESAR SALAD NO DRESSING 
I WILL 
HAVE STEAK AND KIDNEY PIE YOU ARE 
DOCTOR SEAN GABB DIRECTOR OF THE 
LIBERTARIAN ALLIANCE WILL YOU 
EXPLAIN WHY THIS ISSUE OF OBESITY 
IS TO DO WITH OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES 
IT'S OUR RIGHT TO RUN OUR HROEUFS 
AS WE PLEASE OUR LIVES AS WE 
PLEASE IF WE MAKE MISTAKES AND WE 
GROW ENORMOUSLY FAT OR WE FALL DOWN 
DEAD AT FIFTY WITH SOME FOOD RELATED 
CONDITION IT'S OUR PROBLEM BUT 
IT'S OUR RIGHT TO BRING THOSE 
PROBLEMS ON OURSELVES IF WE SO 
CHOOSE CHOOSE THIS SUPERMARKET CHANGE HAS CHAIN 
HAS A CLEAR SYSTEM OF FOOD 
LABELLING I RECKON IF THE 
GOVERNMENT WAS SERIOUS ABOUT 
TACKLING OBESITY IT WOULD INTRODUCE 
THAT IN ALL SUPERMARKETS 
SO FAR THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS 
RELUCTANT TO TAKE THE FOOD INDUSTRY 
ON WHAT SHOULD WE BE LOOKING FOR 
WHEN WE COME SHOPPING 
RIGHT WELL 
IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT MAKING 
HEALTHIER CHOICES LOOKING AT OUR 
MULTIPLE TRAFFIC LIGHT FRONT OF 
PACK LABELLING THIS TELLS YOU AT A 
GLANCE WHAT THE HEALTHIER OPTIONS 
ARE IT TELLS YOU CALORIES FAT 
SALT AND SUGAR HOW MUCH IS IN A 
PORTION OF THE PRODUCT IT WILL BE 
LABELLED GREEN FOR LOW AMBER FOR 
MEDIUM AND RED FOR HIGH THIS IS 
THIS IS THIS IS A VOLUNTARY THING 
THAT SAINSBURY'S HAS SPWR DUESED 
ITSELF IT HASN'T BEEN IMPOSED BY 
THE GOVERNMENT 
ABSOLUTELY WE WERE 
THE FIRST U. K. RETAILER TO ADOPT THE 
TRAFFIC LIGHT SYSTEM WE CAN SEE 
IT'S CHANGING PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOUR 
WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR SALES ANALYSIS 
WE CAN TELL THAT PEOPLE ARE MOVING 
AWAY FROM PRODUCTS THAT HAVE LOTS 
OF REDS TO MORE GREENS AND AMBERS 
WHICH IS A PROMISING SIGN 
I HAVE A 
PROBLEM WITH I HAVE BEEN LOOKING 
AROUND THE STORE A LOT OF YOUR 
TRAFFIC LIGHTS AND VERY FEW OF 
THEM JUST HAVE GREEN UPON THEM 
HERE IS A GREEN ON IT WHOLEGRAIN 
MINI WHAETS IT SAYS WHOLE GRAIN 
WHEAT THAT'S ALL THERE IS IN IT L. 
MEAN WE KIND OF KNOW IF YOU EAT RAW 
WHEAT IT'S NOT GOING TO TILL YOU 
WE ARE SAYING NOT GOING TO KILL 
YOU WE KNOW BALANCED DIET CAN BE 
DIFFICULT WITH THE LIFESTYLES WE 
LEAD SO LOOK FOR THE LABELLING TO 
HELP YOU MAKE HEALTHIER CHOICES 
ARE YOU TRYING TO CREATE SOME RISK 
FREE SOCIETY WHERE EVERYONE'S 
WRAPPED UP IN COTTON WOOL MAX MAX SOMETIMES THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO 
PROTECT US EVEN FROM OURSELVES 
THIS HAS GOT TO BE ABOUT INDIVIDUAL 
CHOICE I HAVE AN EXPERIMENT ARE 
YOU READY O. K. 
DO YOU WANT EGG AND O. K. CHIPS DO YOU WANT SALAD 
EGG AND 
CHIPS SOUNDS NICE DOESN'T IT 
THAT'S CHOICE 
I AM JOINED BY THE HEALTH SECRETARY 
HOW SERIOUSLY DO YOU SEE THE 
PROBLEM OF OBESITY 
I SEE IT AS A 
VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM MAINLY BECAUSE 
WE ASKED THE SCIENTIST AND 
CLINICIAN TO LOOK AT THIS WE ASKED 
THEM WHAT THE WORLD WOULD LOOK LIKE 
IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTY AND IT WAS THEIR REPORT 
THAT DRIVEN POLICY AND IT IS THE 
SCIENCE AND THE CLINICIANS VIEW 
THAT WILL GUIDE US THROUGH IT 
MAX'S I AM WITH JILL THON ARGUMENT 
MAX'S ARGUMENT WAS NOT AN ARGUMENT 
ABOUT OBESITY IT WAS ABOUT PUBLIC 
HEALTH IT WAS SAYING THE 
GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T INTERVENE 
THAT IS THE EXTREME LIBERTARIAN 
VIEW AND I THINK THAT IS WRONG AND 
ON OBESITY AND LIFESTYLE EPPE DICK 
EPIDEMIC WE KNOW IT IS AS BIG A 
PROBLEM AS SMOKING WAS 
WHY ISN'T 
THE ACTION YOU PROPOSE MORE DRIS 
TICK 
WELL OUR POLICY IS 
DRASTIC TICK DRASTIC WE WE ARE SEEKING TO GO 
WITH THE FOOD INDUSTRY WE HAVE 
FOOD LABEL TOLING A LEVEL THAT 
DOESN'T EXIST IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY 
IN THE WORLD AND WE HAVE DONE THAT 
IN COOPERATION WITH THE INDUSTRY 
NOW THE PROBLEM THAT WE POINTED OUT 
IN OUR RESPONSE TO THE OBESITY 
REVIEW THAT WAS KUKED BY THE 
SCIENTIST IS THAT THERE IS THREE 
DIFFERENT SYSTEM AND PEOPLE GO INTO 
DIFFERENT SUPERMARKETS AND THERE IS 
A DIFFERENT SYSTEM AND WE HAVE 
ASKED THE FOOD STANDARDS AGENCY TO 
WORK WITH THE SECTOR TO COME UP 
WITH ONE SYSTEM 
WHY NOT IMPOSE IT 
IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR SO FOUR YEARS AGO THE 
GOVERNMENT CAME ONE A REPORT SAYING 
WE NEED A CLEAR STRAIGHTFORWARD 
CODING SYSTEM THAT IS IN COMMON 
USE THIS YOU YOU SAY WHAT WAS 
NEEDED WITH A SINGLE SIMPLE AND 
EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO FOOD 
LABELLING BY THE WHOLE INDUSTRY 
NOTHING HAS MOVED ON IN FOUR YEARS 
BUT IN BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENED IS 
THAT WE HAVE GOT THE BIGGEST THE 
MOST UBITQUITOUS FOOD LABELLING 
SYSTEM IN THE WORLD PEOPLE HAVE 
DIFFERENT VIEWS THERE IS A VIEW 
YOU SHOULD HAVE A COLOUR CODED 
SYSTEM AND WHAT YOU NEED IS LOTS 
OF INFORMATION ON THE PACK AND 
THERE SAINT VIEW THAT SAYS YOU NEED COMBINATION 
IF YOU BELIEVE THAT COMBINATION INTERVENTION IS THE RIGHT APPROACH 
JUST DECIDE WHETHER IT IS TRAFFIC 
LIGHTS OR WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE 
AND SAY I WANT SUPERMARKETS TO HAVE 
THIS SYSTEM SO THAT PEOPLE 
CONSUMERS HAVE A CLEARER IDEA THAT THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE SAID WE WANT THEM 
TO HAVE ONE SYSTEM WE WANT TO WORK 
WITH THEM TO A. R. ROIV AT THAT 
SITUATION BUT IN THE INTERIM 
PERIOD 
SHOULDN'T YOU IMPOSE IT WE PERIOD WE HAVE 
WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT AGAINST HAVE IT 
DEPEN WHAT YOU ARE SEEKING TO IT IMPOSE WE HAVE IMPOSED HEALTHY 
SCHOOL MEALS WE HAVE IMPOSED THE 
ABOLITION OF FOOD THAT IS HIGH IN 
FAT SALT AND SUGAR FROM VENDING 
MACHINE WE HAVE BANNED THEM FROM 
VENDING MACHINES IN SCHOOLS SO 
THERE IS AN ELEMENT 
THE FOOD 
LABELLING SYSTEM AS WELL 
THERE IS 
ANOTHER SIDE WHERE YOU TRY TO BRING 
THE INDUSTRY ALONG WITH YOU IF YOU 
DON'T YOU WILL END UP WITH A BATTLE 
WHERE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THE 
LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR TO COMPLY 
WITH LAW THEY WON'T LOOK AT HOW WE 
CAN WORK TOGETHER AND GOVERNMENT 
CAN'T DO THIS ALONE TO TACK IT WILL 
PROBLEM 
WHAT ABOUT THE SUGGESTION PROBLEM THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE ON THE 
FOOD INDUSTRY AND THAT IS SOMETHING 
THE BRITISH HEART FOUNDATION HAVE 
SAID THAT YOU ARE FEARFUL OF THEM 
NO THAT IS NOT TRUE YOU RUN THIS 
RISK THAT IF YOU TAKE MODERATE 
VIEW TO BRING PEOPLE ALONG WITH YOU 
IF YOU TAKE THE ISSUE OF SMOKING 
WHAT GOVERNMENT DID BECAUSE WE 
NEED TO BRING THE PUBLIC WITH US 
AS WELL WE DIDN'T JUMP TO THE 
REGULATORY APPROACH OF SMOKE FREE 
ENVIRONMENT WHICH WE INTRODUCED 
LAST JULY WITH GREAT SUCCESS IF 
GOVERNMENT HAD TRIED TO DO THAT TOO 
EARLY WE WOULD HAVE FOUND IT DIDN'T 
WORK SMOKING IS A REALLY GOOD 
EXAMPLE OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY 
THAT IS REALLY DELIVERED RESULTS 
OVER THE YEARS BY APPROACHING IT 
IN A WAY THAT IS PARTLY REGULATORY 
AND PARTLY CONSENSUAL AND I THINK 
THAT IS THE WAY TO GO AND YOU HAVE 
TO BRING THE PUBLIC WITH YOU 
BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE 
LABELLING SYSTEMS UNDER THE SUN IF 
THE PUBLIC DON'T TAKE ANY NOTICE I 
WON'T HAVE ANY EFFECT 
LET US TALK 
ABOUT OBESITY IN CHILDREN SIXTEEN PER CENT OF 
CHILDREN ARE NOW CONSIDERED TO BE 
OBESE AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN 
ACTION THERE IS A BAN ON 
ADVERTISING OF JUNK FOODS ODGE 
SPECIFIC CHILDREN'S PROGRAMMING 
BUT OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN 
WATCH OTHER PROGRAMMES LIKE 
CORONATION STREET THE X. FACTOR 
SATURDAY NIGHT TAKEAWAY AND THERE 
YOU ARE GETTING A LOT OF ADVERTS 
FOR JUNK FOOD WHY NOT SAY NO JUNK 
FOOD ADVERTISING BEFORE THE NINE HUNDRED 
WATERSHED 
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE WATERSHED TOO DRASTIC AS A FIRST STEP THE 
FIRST STEP AND IT IS A VERY 
IMPORTANT FIRST STEP WHICH WAS 
INTRODUCES IN JANUARY IS WE BAN 
FOOD ADVERTISING FROM CHILDREN'S 
PROGRAMMES WE LOOK AT THE EFFECT 
OF THAT WHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE 
AGREED TO AND THE ADVERTISING 
INDUSTRY HAVE BROUGHT THAT REVIEW 
THROUGH TO SUMMER AND WE LOOK AT 
THE EFFECT OF THAT AND WE HAVE AN 
EVIDENCE BASE BEFORE WE MOVE ON THE 
THE NEXT STEP THERE IS LOTS OF 
PEOPLE WHO SAY THE EVIDENCE FROM 
OTHER COUNTRIES SUGGEST THIS 
DOESN'T HAVE AN EFFECT THAT IT IS 
DAMAGING THE INDUSTRY AND DAMAGING 
THE TELEVISION INDUSTRY WITHOUT 
HAVING THE DESIRED EFFECT ON 
OBESITY 
YOU SAY THAT IS TOO OBESITY DRASTIC I AM STRUGGLING TO 
UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT 
AS A FIRST 
MEASURE 
YOU HAVE SAID BEEN QUOTED MEASURE AS SAYING IT IS AS SERIOUS AS 
CLIMATE CHANGE IF IT IS YOU NEED 
URGENT MEASURES AND YOU ARE SAYING 
LET US GO SOFTLY SOFTLY BUILD UP 
CONSENSUS AND WE WILL INCH FORWARD 
THE ISSUE ABOUT CLIMB CHANGE WASN'T 
ME SAYING THAT IT WAS THE 
SCIENTISTS WHO SAID THERE ARE 
PARALLELS WITH CLIMATE CHANGE THE 
MOST OBVIOUS ONE IS YOU CAN REACH A 
STAGE WHERE THERE IS A POINT OF NO 
RETURN WE ARE GOING ALONG WITH THE 
SCIENTISTS HERE WHAT THEY SAY IS 
YOU HAVE TO WORK ACROSS GOVERNMENT 
AND YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH CIVIL 
SOCIETY AS WELL TO CHANGE 
ATTITUDES AND THAT IS A LOT MORE 
DIFFICULT THAN SIMPLY GOVERNMENTS 
SAYING WE ARE GOING TO MOVE 
IMMEDIATELY TO DRACONIAN MEASURES 
THAT FORCE PEOPLE TO DO THINGS AND 
COULD HAVE A COUNTER PRODUCTIVE 
ELEMENT I AM NOT SAYING WE RULE 
OUT RADICAL POLICIES I AM SAYING WE 
HAVE TO MOVE ON A BASIS THAT IS 
EVIDENCE BASED AND HAS CLINICAL 
EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT IT 
I WONDER IF 
WE CAN MOVE TO WIDER ISSUES HOW 
WOULD YOU CHARACTERISE THE PAST FEW 
WEEKS FOR THE PRIME MINISTER THEY THEY HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT WEEKS BUT THEY 
ARE ALWAYS DIFFICULT WEEKS FOR 
PRIME MINISTERS L. L. HAVE BEEN 
HANGING ABOUT THIS POLITICAL WORLD 
FOR LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE SEEN THE 
KIND OF ATTEMPTED CHARACTER 
ASSASSINATION WE HAVE SEEN ON BLAIR 
THAT WE HAVE SEEN ON JOHN MAYOR AND 
MARGARET THATCHER THIS HAPPENS IT 
IS PART OF BEING THE PRIME MINISTER 
AND AS FAR AS WHAT IS HAPPENING AT 
THE MOMENT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL 
SITUATION NOT JUST THE 
INTERNATIONAL SITUATION IN RELATION 
TO ECONOMIC SITUATION BUT ALSO AS 
WE HAVE SEEN THE REAL PROBLEMS WITH 
FOOD SHORTAGES ROUND THE WORLD 
THESE ARE VERY DIFFICULT ISSUES AND 
THEY ARE WORLDWIDE AND I THINK MY 
VIEW IS IF YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO IS 
SHALLOW YOU HAVEN'T GOT IT IN 
GORDON BROWN WE BONT INVITING THE 
CAMERAS IN WHILE HE PULLS OUT THE 
SHREDDIES FOR THE KIDS HE WON'T 
TELL YOU WHO HE KISSED BEHIND THE 
BIKE SHED WHAT YOU WILL GET IS A 
SERIOUS MAN FOR SERIOUS TIMES BUT BUT WHY THE POLL RATING PLUMMETING HE 
SLES POPULAR IN A RECORD SHORT 
TIME THAN NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN WE WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH DIFFICULT TIMES 
YOU CAN HAVE A PARALLEL WITH OTHER 
LEADERS WHAT YOU HAVE GOT WITH 
GORDON IS SOMEONE WHO IS DETERMINES 
TO TACKLE THE SERIOUS ISSUES AND 
WHEN WE GET ROUND TO TALKING NOT 
ABOUT PERSONALITIES BUT POLICIES 
THE KIND OF POLICYS WE WILL LOOK AT 
THE LONDON ELECTIONS AND THE 
ELECTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ABOUT 
THE POLICIES ON CLIMATE 
CHANGE ON ENERGY SECURITY ON 
THESE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE HOUSING 
THAT WILL AFFECT PEOPLE'S LIVE 
WHEN WE GET ROUND TO THAT YOU WILL 
SEE THE STRENGTH OF GORDON BROWN'S 
POLITICS AND YOU WILL SEE THE 
STRENGTH OF THIS GOVERNMENT THIS THIS IS ABOUT EXTENDING THE PERIOD THAT 
TERRORIST SUSPECTS CAN BE HELD FOR 
FOUR THE DAYS JACQUI SMITH ARGUES 
THIS MORNING IT IS NEEDED YOU GET 
KEITH VAS SAYING FRANKLY AT THE 
MOMENT THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HAVE 
A MAJORITY FOR THIS 
THERE AGAIN IF 
YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THIS WE 
HAD SEVEN DAYS AN THE ARGUMENT 
AGAINST EX TENGED IT WERE THERE 
EVERY TIME NOW WE HAVE TO TWENTY EIGHT DAYS 
A WE NEEDED THAT TO DEAL WITH AT 
LEAST THREE SERIOUS PLOTS NOW 
THIS ARGUMENT WILL OBVIOUSLY 
REVERBERATE ROUND PARLIAMENT OVER 
THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS AND WE 
WILL LISTEN TO VARIOUS VIEWS BUT 
THE VIEW OF GOVERNMENT IS WE ARE 
NOT SEEKING TO MOVE TO FORTY TWO DAYS WE 
ARE KEEPING THE 
DAYS IN PLACE 
BUT WE ARE SAYING THAT THERE WILL 
BE CASES WHERE WE WILL NEED TO MOVE 
BEYOND THAT AND WITH THE 
INVOLVEMENT OF THE JUDICIARY WITH 
VERY IMPORTANT SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE 
WE WANT TO ACTUALLY PLAN FOR THAT 
NOT LOOK AT THIS AFTER WE HAVE HAD 
A REAL PROBLEM AND SAY WE WISH THAT 
HAD BEEN IN PLACE SO IT IS ABOUT 
MAKING DIFFICULT DECISION IN 
GOVERNMENT 
WILL THE GOVERNMENT GET GOVERNMENT A MAJORITY ON IT 
YES I THINK WE 
WILL I AM CERTAIN THAT WE WILL L. 
THINK ONCE WE HAVE TALKED ALL THIS 
THROUGH AND ONCE WE HAVE I MEAN 
YOU ONLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE SEVEN 
PLANES THAT WERE DUE TO BE BLOWN UP 
OVER THE ATLANTIC TO SEE JIT 
JACQUI SMITH HAS SAID TODAY THIS 
IS A JACQUI SMITH THIS IS A VERY 
SERIOUS PROBLEM WE WOULD ONLY MOVE 
BEYOND TWENTY EIGHT DAY TONS RECOMMENDATION 
OF THE POLICE ON THE 
RECOMMENDATION OF A JUDGE AND THEY 
WOULD BE IN VERY FEW CASES BUT I 
THINK THAT IS NECESSARY GIVEN THE 
COMPLEXITY OF THE PLOTS THAT WE ARE 
TRYING TO CRACK AT THE MOMENT I I WANT TO TAKE US BAH BACK TO WHERE 
WE STARTED ON HEALTH AND OBESITY L. 
WANT TO SEE IF YOU ARE LIVING UP TO 
THE GOVERNMENT'S BILLING DO YOU 
EAT YOUR FIVE PORTIONS OF FRUIT AND 
VEG 
I DO L. DON'T WANT TO A SMART VEG ALAN ON THIS BUT I TRY 
YOU HAVE 
NEVER EXCEEDED THE TWENTY ONE UNITS OF A 
ALCOHOL PEVER WEEK 
I HAVE BUT I AM 
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT 
THE FIVE A DAY ISN'T FIVE PORTIONS 
OF ALCOHOL A DAY EXERCISE L. RUN EXERCISE I RUN I PLAY TENNIS I WALK 
WHAT A 
HEALTHY MODEL OF A HEALTH SECRETARY 
I AM SURE KEN CLARKE WOULDN'T HAVE 
GIVEN THE SAME ANSWERS WHEN HE WAS 
HEALTH SECRETARY AND IF YOU WERE 
SHIFTING UNCOMFORTABLY IN YOUR SEAT 
YOU CAN CHECK YOUR BODY MASS INDEX 
VIA THE WEBSITE YOU WILL FIND MORE 
BICKERING FROM MAX AND JILL AND A 
QUIZ TOO 
NOW WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT POLES AT 
THE POLLS WE LEARNED THAT POLES 
WERE AN INFLUENTIAL GROUP AT THE 
POLISH GENERAL ELECTIONFUL COULD 
THE SAME THING BE HAPPENING WITH 
OUR LOCAL ELECTION I SPOKE TO 
JENNY KIRK AND ASKED WHAT IMPACT 
THE POLISH POPULATION COULD HAVE IN 
THE EAST 
IT SEEMS TO BE THE ISSUE 
ABOUT POLISH VOTERS ABOUT HOW MANY 
HAVE SIGNED UP TO VOTE HERE IN 
PETERBOROUGH NOT MANY APPEARED TO 
HAVE SIGNED UP TO VOTE L. SPOKE TO 
ONE CANDIDATE WHO SAID SHE HAD BEEN 
ROUND HER WARD AND IN ALL THE 
HOUSES SHE HASN'T FOUND A SINGLE 
POLISH PERSON WHO HAD REGISTERED TO 
VOTE NOW THIS COULD BE BECAUSE 
THEY ARE A TRANSIENT COMMUNITY 
MANY DON'T STAY FOR LONG IT COULD 
BE THEY DON'T REALISE THEY QUALIFY 
TO VOTE BUT THEY DO BECAUSE ALL E. U. 
NATIONALS QUALIFY TO VOTE FOR LOCAL 
ELECTION THEY DON'T QUALIFY TO 
VOTE FOR THE NATIONAL ELECTIONS 
THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION ARE 
GETTING PEOPLE TO SIGN UP 
THAT IS 
WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING TODAY 
OUTSIDE THIS CHURCH GETTING PEOPLE 
TO FILL IN REGISTRATION FORMS SO 
THEY QUALIFY TO VOTE THERE IS A 
MASSIVE POLISH COMMUNITY ABOUT 
TEN THOUSAND IS THE ESTIMATE IT MAKES UP 
TEN PER CENT OF THE WORK FORCE IN 
PETERBOROUGH AND THAT IS A LOT OF 
POTENTIAL VOTERS L. SPOKE TO SOME 
AS THEY CAME IN SOME SAID THEY 
FELT IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT THEY 
VOTED BACK IN POLAND OTHERS DID 
FEEL IT WAS IMPORTANT TO VOTE HERE 
IN BRITAIN L. SUPPOSE THE MESSAGE 
IS THEY FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO 
VOTE AND THAT IS REFLECTED BACK IN 
POLAND BECAUSE THEY LOCAL ELECTIONS 
THEY HAVE A FORTY SIX PER CENT TURN OUT THERE 
THAT IS NINE PER CENT HIGHER THAN HERE IN 
BRITAIN SO IT WOULD BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE WHETHER THE 
POLES DO GO TO THE POLLS HERE IN 
BRITAIN CERTAINLY IF THEY DO WANT 
TO THEY WILL HAVE TO GET THEIR 
SKATES ON BECAUSE THE CLOSING DATE 
IS WEDNESDAY TO REGISTER 
AND THERE IS MORE ON POLLS FOR VIEW 
NERS THE EAST AND PARTS OF THE 
NORTH OF ENGLAND IN A MOMENT LATER 
IN THE PROGRAMME OUR BIOFUEL ARE 
BIOFUELS ARE AS GOOD FOR THE 
ENVIRONMENT AS WE THINK THAT IS 
AFTER THE POLITICS SHOW WHERE YOU 
ARE 
WELCOME TO CITY HALL FOR THE FIRST 
OF THREE IN DEPTH INTERVIEWS WE ARE 
DOING THE WITH LEADING CANDIDATES 
IN THE RACE TO BECOME MAYOR OF 
LONDON WITH A BUDGET OF TEN 
BILLION AND HUGE INFLUENCE OVER 
TRANSPORT POLICING HOUSING AND THE 
ENVIRONMENT IT IS ONE OF THE MOST 
POWERFUL POSITIONS IN BRITAIN TODAY 
BRIAN PADDICK IS OUR MAN TODAY WE 
RECORDED THIS EARLIER BECAUSE HE 
WILL HAVE BEEN TAKING PART IN THE 
LONDON THAT ARE MARATHON WE WILL 
HEAR FROM THIS HEAR FROM HIM 
AFTER THAT 
I WAS IN THE MAKE UP ROOM AT SKY 
AND THE MAKE UP ARTIST THOUGHT THAT 
KEN LIVINGSTONE AND BORIS JOHNSON 
WERE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE RUNNING 
WHAT YOU DO ABOUT IT IS YOU DO 
MANIFESTO LAUNCHES 
IT WAS WITH 
THESE WORDS THAT BRIAN PADDICK 
LAUNCHED HIS MANIFESTO ON MONDAY SO 
SO WHAT IS HE OFFERING THE CAPITAL 
IT WAS HERE IN BRIXTON THAT HE MADE 
HIS NAME AS A POLICE OFFICER SO 
THERE WAS A LITTLE SURPRISE WHEN HE 
LAUNCHED HIS CAMPAIGN HERE IN 
JANUARY HE DID SO WITH A PLEDGE TO 
CUT CRIME IN THE CITY BY TWENTY PER CENT 
CRACKDOWN ON GUN AND KNIFE OFFENCES 
AND PUT POLICE OFFICERS BACK ON 
FRONT LINE DUTY THE PROBLEM WITH 
THAT THOUGH IS THAT THE MAYOR 
DOESN'T CONTROL OPERATIONAL 
POLICING 
WHAT THE MAYOR HERE CAN POLICING DO IS TO SET THE BUDGET FOR THE 
POLICE AND CERTAINLY USE THAT 
POWER TO BUY ADDITIONAL OFF SORES 
WHATEVER BUT THEREAFTER IT IS VERY 
MUCH TALKING TO THE COMMISSIONER TO 
TRY TO GET THINGS DONE SO THERE IS 
NO WAY IN WHICH THE MAYOR HAS 
DIRECT CONTROL OVER THE POLICE NO 
PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THIS MONDAY'S 
LAUNCH SAW AN EMPHASIS ON AREAS THE 
MAYOR CAN MORE DIRECTLY IMPACT LIKE 
HOUSING TRANSPORT AND THE 
ENVIRONMENT HIS GREEN POLICY 
INCLUDE MORE RECYCLING BINS ON 
PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND A PLAN TO 
PLANT TEN THOUSAND TREES 
IT COULD BE A GIMMICK PLANTING 
TEN THOUSAND TREES IS ONE THING MAKING 
SURE THEY GROW TO MATURITY AND ARE 
CARED FOR IS A DIFFERENT ISSUE 
THERE ARE A BANK OF OTHER POLICIES 
WHICH ARE NOT FLESHED OUT ENOUGH 
WHICH SOUND INTERESTING 
SUPERFICIALLY THEY COULD MEAN ALL 
SORTS OF THINGS 
A CENTREPIECE OF HIS TRANSPORT 
POLICY IS A COMMITMENT TO BUILDING 
MORE TRAMS TO FORM NETWORK FROM 
CROYDON THROUGH BRIXTON PECKHAM 
WATERLOO AND UP TO CAMDEN THROUGH 
OXFORD STREET 
WHILE POLICIES LIKE THAT THE 
PROMISE OF FREE BIKE HIRE SCHEME 
AND FREE TRAVEL TO STUDENTS MIGHT 
BE VOTE WINNERS OTHERS LOOK MORE 
CONTROVERSIAL LIKE HANDING OVER 
THE RUNNING OF THE TUBE TO PRIVATE 
COMPANIES 
I AM NOT SURE THAT BRIAN COMPANIES PADDICK'S IDEA OF RUNNING EACH LINE 
ON A SEPARATE FRANCHISE AS IT WERE 
IS EITHER LEGALLY POSSIBLE OR 
VERY PRACTICAL ONE OF THE THINGS 
ABOUT THE LONDON UNDERGROUND IS 
THAT IT'S A WHOLE AND YOU WANT TO 
RUN TO AS ONE ORGANISATION OVERALL 
AND YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO PHREUT 
IT UP SPLIT IT UP 
IT'S ALSO VERY 
UNLIKELY TO PROVE POPULAR WITH THE 
UNIONS THE OTHER AREA THE MAYOR 
HAS SUBSTANTIAL CONTROL OVER IS 
HOUSING ALL CANDIDATES AGREE WE 
NEED TO BUILD MORE BUT DISAGREE 
ABOUT HOW AND WHERE WE SHOULD MAKE 
IT AVAILABLE HIS SOLUTION INCLUDES 
DEALING WITH THE NUMBER OF EMPTY 
HOMES IN THE CITY BUILDING ON 
DISUSED PUBLIC LAND 
THOSE ARE PART 
OF THE SOLUTION BUT THOSE ARE A 
RELATIVELY SMALL PART OF THE 
SOLUTION WHAT WE NEED TO SEE FROM 
BRIAN PADDICK IS SOME VERY CLEAR 
ATTAINABLE TARGETS ABOUT WHAT 
HOUSING IS TO BE TKHREURED 
DELIVERED WERE HE TO BE THE MAYOR 
BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION THE THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS HAVE LOT OF 
GROUND TO CATCH UP THE QUESTION IS 
WHETHER THIS POLICY PLATFORM IS 
ENOUGH TO CHALLENGE THE TWO 
FRONTRUNNERS FRONTRUNNERS BRIAN PADDICK IT'S A TOUGH 
BUSINESS THIS POLITICS LARK SOME 
FEEL YOUR CAMPAIGN'S BEEN MUTED SO 
FAR ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU 
HAVEN'T MADE AS MUCH IMPACT 
NOT AT 
ALL WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE 
POSSIBLY CAN THE DIFFICULTY IS 
TRYING TO GET THE COVERAGE WHILST 
BROADCASTERS ARE COVERED BY THE 
REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE'S ACT 
OF COURSE PRINT MEDIA AREN'T 
COVERED BY IT SO YOU TURN UP AT 
HUSTINGS GIVE A GOOD PERFORMANCE 
AND YOU GET ONE ONE LINE IN THE 
EVENING STANDARD THE OTHER 
CANDIDATES GET A PAGE EACH 
THIS IS 
THE PROBLEM YOU MIGHT BE A LEGEND 
IN LAMBETH AS A POLICE OFFICER YOU 
FOUND LONDON IS A BIGGER PLACE YOU 
ARE STRUGGLING FOR RECOGNITION 
THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID I AM MAKING 
AN IMPACT ON THE STREET IN THE 
HUSTINGS THAT WE ARE DOING AM 
JUST NOT GETTING FAIR COVERAGE IN 
THE PRESS 
ARE YOU OUT ON THE 
STREET THAT MUCH I GUESS THE IM I 
GET THE IMPRESSION YOU ARE NOT 
OPTING FOR THE TRADITIONAL STYLE OF 
WALK ABOUTS NOT WITH THE OTHER 
CANDIDATES IS THAT LACK OF 
INFORMATION OR ORGANISATION OR 
FUNDING 
I AM GETTING OUT ON TO THE FUNDING STREET AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE I AM 
MEETING ORDINARY PEOPLE THE MOST 
COMMON MESSAGE I AM GETTING IS 
THEY'RE FED UP WITH KEN LIVINGSTONE 
AND THINK BORIS JOHNSON IS TOO MUCH 
OF A RISK THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE 
YOU DON'T REGRET THIS UP AGAINST 
THESE BIG PLAYERS YOU DON'T REGRET 
THIS ENTERING THE FRAY 
I THINK 
LONDONERS DESERVE AN ALTERNATIVE 
BETWEEN LIVING AND BORIS JOHNSON 
LABOUR SUPPORTERS ARE VERY NERVOUS 
ABOUT REAPPOINTING KEN LIVINGSTONE 
WITH SOME JUSTIFICATION AND AND 
CONSERVATIVE SUPPORTERS ARE VERY 
VERY NERVOUS ABOUT HAVING BORIS 
JOHNSON RUNNING CITY HALL IT'S 
ONLY RIGHT THAT LONDONERS HAVE A 
SERIOUS ALTERNATIVE 
LET'S GET 
STUCK INTO THE POLL POLL POLICY 
WHAT MADE YOU WAKE UP ONE MORNING 
AND DECIDE YOU WANTED TO PRIVATISE 
THE TUBE 
WELL I DON'T WANT TO 
PRIVATISE THE TUBE ALL I AM 
SUGGESTING IS DOCKLANDS LIGHT 
RAILWAY FOR EXAMPLE IS A MODEL OF 
HOW A PUBLIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM 
SHOULD BE RUN T. WINS AWARDS 
CUSTOMERS ARE HAPPY WITH IT IT'S 
RELIABLE IT'S RUN ON A CONCESSION 
MODEL TRANSPORT FOR LONDON CONTROL 
DOCKLANDS LIGHT RAILWAY BUT GET A 
PRIVATE COMPANY TO RUN IT IF THAT 
SYSTEM WORKS WELL THERE IT RUNS 
THE SAME SYSTEM RUNS ON EVERY BUS 
ROUTE IN LONDON 
SOUNDS LIKE 
PRIVATISATION TO ME 
WELL IT'S NOT 
PRIVATISATION PRIVATISATION IS 
HANDING THE WHOLE THING OVER TO A 
PRIVATE COMPANY ALLOWING THEM TO 
SET THE TIMETABLE THE FARES THE 
WHOLE THING 
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS 
WITH THE TUBE VOLUNTARILY WHAT KEN 
LIVINGSTONE AND OTHERS WOULD SAY IS 
HE HAS INHERITED A SITUATION THERE 
IN DOCKLANDS AND OVERGROUND 
RAILWAY YOU WOULD HAVE A CHANCE AS 
MAYOR TO DECIDE WHAT YOU DO AND DO 
IT VOLUNTARILY WHY 
LOOK AT THE 
SERVICE PEOPLE GET ON LONDON 
UNDERGROUND LOOK AT THE STATE OF 
THE SERVICE THAT IS PROVIDED LOOK 
AT THE FACT THAT WE GET STRIKES ON 
A FREQUENT BASIS COMPARE THAT 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO AVOID STRIKES 
COMPARE THAT WITH WHAT HAPPENS ON 
DOCKLANDS LIGHT RAILWAY L. WOULD 
SAY TO LONDONERS WHAT SERVICE WOULD 
YOU PREFER THE SORT OF SERVICE 
THAT YOU GET ON DOCKLANDS OR THE 
SORT OF SERVICE YOU GET ON LONDON 
UNDERGROUND 
YOU HAVE A MONOPOLY UNDERGROUND IF THEY GET A FIXED FEE AND CAN'T 
MAKE PROFITS WITH THAT FEE WHAT 
HAPPENS IS THE SERVICE FALLS APART 
WELL YOU DON'T HAVE A MONOPOLY 
SUPPLIER AT THE MOMENT YOU HAVE 
GOT THE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP 
WITH TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE 
MAINTAINING THE TRACKS AND LIGHTS 
METRONET HAS GONE BUST TUBE LINES 
IS STILL RUNNING AND STICKING TO 
CONTRACTS STICKING TO TIME AND 
DELIVERING VALUE FOR MONEY THAT 
SHOWS THAT LONDON UNDERGROUND ISN'T 
A COMPLETE INTEGRATED HOLE T. CAN BE 
SPLIT INTO DIFFERENT SECTIONS AND 
IT CAN BE RUN BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE 
ON DIFFERENT LINES 
ANOTHER ASPECT 
OF AN EMOTIVE ISSUE THE CONGESTION 
CHARGE THE HIGHER CHARGE FOR GAS 
GUZZLING VEHICLES THIS WILL MAKE 
MAKE LONDONERS THINK TWICE ABOUT 
USING FOUR BY FOURS THERE BY REDUCING 
CONGESTION AND REDUCING NUMBER OF 
OF PEDESTRIAN INJURIES 
IT'S A 
PACKAGE OF MEASURES IT'S TWENTY FIVE FOR 
THE MOST POLLUTING VEHICLES AND KEN 
LIVINGSTONE IS TALKING ABOUT 
EXEMPTING THOUSANDS OF SMALLER CARS 
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT THE TRAFFIC IS 
LIKE IN CENTRAL LONDON IT GRINDS 
TO A HALT CONGESTION IS NOW WORSE 
THAN IT WAS WHEN THE CONGESTION 
CHARGE WAS INTRODUCED 
WHY DO YOU 
OPPOSE THE TWENTY FIVE CHARGE ON THE GAS 
GUZZLERS 
WE NEED A SCHEME THAT GUZZLERS ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE WHAT MAKES 
SENSE HERE IS WE NEED TO DO 
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO REDUCE 
CONGESTION THAT DOESN'T MEAN 
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE OFF PUBLIC 
TRANSPORT INTO PRIVATE CARS AS 
KEN'S EXEMPT BGS OF EXEMPTINGS IS 
GOING TO DO 
DO YOU KNOW WHOSE IDEA 
THE HIGHER CHARGE WAS ORIGINALLY 
IT WAS A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT IDEA AND 
WHEN YOU HAVE SOUND POLICIES LIKE 
RICHMOND COUNCIL HAS WHERE PEOPLE 
HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR THEIR 
RESIDENT'S PARKING BAY BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE GAS GUZZLING CAR AND IT'S 
GRADED SO THAT THE MORE FUEL YOUR 
CAR USES THE MORE YOU HAVE TO PAY 
THAT MAKES ABSOLUTE SENSE BUT 
THIS 
BUT THIS IS A LIBERAL THIS DEMOCRAT POLICY THAT YOU HAVE 
CHANGED THIS LIBERAL DEMOCRAT 
POLICY WHAT AUTHORITY DID YOU HAVE 
TO DO THAT PEOPLE DON'T AGREE WITH 
YOU IN THE PARTY DO THEY I I CONSULTED WITH THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS LOCALLY L. DISCUSSED IT 
WITH POLICY ADVISERS TO THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS AND WE DECIDED THAT IS 
THE POLICY THAT WE WOULD HAVE HAD 
TIME ROUND FOR LONDON MY POLICY IS 
THIS LET'S TACKLE THE THINGS THAT 
ARE REALLY IMPACTING ON GLOBAL 
WARMING NOT A SMALL 
LET'S LOOK 
AT THAT THE LOW EMISSION ZONE FOR 
HIGH POLLUTING LORRIES YOU OPPOSE 
THAT TOO HOW ARE YOU IMPACTING ON 
THE HEALTH RISKS AND ISSUE OF 
POLLUTION IF YOU ARE OPPOSING THAT 
TRANSPORT FOR LONDON'S OWN 
ESTIMATES SHOW THAT IT WILL IMPROVE 
AIR QUALITY BY SOMETHING LIKE OH THREE PER CENT 
CONVERSELY IT'S GOING TO PUT A LOT 
OF SMALL BUSINESSES AND LONDON'S 
STREET MARKETS OUT OF BUSINESS 
PLACES LIKE THE MARKET I WENT TO 
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO LIKE 
PORTABELLO CAP ROAD WILL GO OUT OF 
BUSINESS 
PRICE TO PAY FOR MANY BUSINESS LONDONERS 
GREEN PARTY AND KEN LONDONERS LIVINGSTONE SAYS THEY WANT TO 
PROMOTE LOCAL HIGH STREETS AND 
PRESERVE MARKETS AND YET THE 
POLICY THEY'RE INTRODUCING ARE 
ACTUALLY GOING TO DO AWAY WITH 
THOSE LOCAL HIGH STREETS AND 
MARKETS WE NEED EFFECTIVE POLICIES 
TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE LIKE THE 
TEN BOUNDARY CHARGE THAT ARE NOT 
GOING TO IMPAB ON OTHER THINGS 
IMPACT ON OTHER THINGS 
DO YOU KNOW 
HOW MUCH THAT IS GOING TO RAISE 
SOME ESTIMATES WHEN THIS HAS BEEN 
MODELLED BY TRANSPORT FOR LONDON 
BEFORE ESTIMATE ABOUT THREE BILLION A 
YEAR 
O. K. NOW YOU HAVE BEEN A YEAR CAREER POLICE OFFICER THAT'S WHAT 
PEOPLE KNOW AND ASSOCIATE YOU WITH 
MAINLY I SUPPOSE IT'S NO SURPRISE 
YOUR ELECTION BROADCAST MADE THAT 
ITS SOLE ISSUE LET'S TAKE A LOOK 
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN YOUNG PEOPLE WERE 
MURDERED IN LONDON 
MOST OF THEM WERE STABBED TO DEATH 
ALL OF THEM WERE UNDER NINETEEN 
SIX OF THEM WERE JUST FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN 
YEARS OLD 
COULD THIS REALLY GRIM GLOOMY 
STUFF S. THAT REALLY THE WAY YOU SEE 
THE CAPITAL 
THAT'S HOW I SEE THAT 
PARTICULAR PROBLEM AND IT'S NOT 
JUST THE FACT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN 
THIRTY EIGHT YOUNG PEOPLE MURDERED IN THE 
LAST SIXTEEN MONTHS THIS IS ABOUT WHEN 
I TALK TO PEOPLE ON THE STREET 
PARTICULARLY PARENTS WITH TEENAGE 
CHILDREN THEY'RE ON EDGE EVERY 
NIGHT THEIR CHILDREN ARE OUT ON THE 
STREET OR THEY'VE GOT OUT TO THE 
CINEMA OR WHEREVER THEY'RE ON EDGE 
UNTIL HE HEAR THE KEY IN THE LOCK 
PEOPLE ARE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT 
THIS ISSUE 
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO 
PUT OUT A REPORT LIKE THAT NOW 
BECAUSE IT'S TAKEN AS ADDING TO 
PEOPLE REINFORCING PEOPLE'S FEARS 
THAT'S A BROADCASTER BUT YOU ARE A 
POLICE OFFICER OR FORMER POLICE 
OFFICER I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE 
CONCERNED ABOUT PRESENTING THINGS 
UNEMOTIVELY AS POSSIBLE 
WHAT WE 
HAVE TO DO IS WE HAVE GOT TO TELL 
PEOPLE HOW IT IS THAT'S WHAT I 
HAVE ALWAYS DONE THAT'S WHAT I HAD 
A REPUTATION FOR IN THE POLICE 
TELLING PEOPLE EXACTLY HOW IT IS 
THAT IS HOW IT IS 
MURDERS ARE DOWN 
TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS ALL 
CRIME IS DOWN IN THE LAST FOUR 
YEARS 
THERE IS A REPORT ON THE YEARS WEBSITE WHERE THEY GO THROUGH AND 
CHECK THE FACTS THAT POLITICIANS 
ARE PRODUCING IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
THIS AND WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT 
KEN'S CLAIMS ON CRIME IS IT GETS 
TWO AND A HALF OUT OF FIVE IN TERMS 
OF RELIABILITY FOR TRUTH THE FACT 
IS KEN LIVINGSTONE IS CHOOSING THE 
YEARS HE WANTS TO DO COMPARISONS 
WITH AND IN FACT 
IT SEEMS A FAIR 
COMPARISON TO TAKE THE LAST FOUR 
YEARS HE HAS BEEN MAYOR BUT THE 
SAME CRIME STATISTICS WERE HAPPY TO 
HAVE SHOWING THAT YOU HAD DONE A 
GOOD JOB IN LAMBETH NOW YOU ARE 
TRYING TO MAKE OUT THERE HASN'T 
BEEN AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE CRIME 
SITUATION 
THE POINT IS THE BRITISH SITUATION KRAOEUPBL SURVEY HAS PWRB CRIME 
SURVEY HAS BEEN BROKEN DOWN TO 
LONDON FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS 
IT'S AN INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC 
SURVEY OF CRIME LEVELS IN LONDON 
THAT SHOWS CRIME LEVELS ARE STABLE 
THAT IT'S NOT GOING DOWN 
IF IT'S 
STABLE IT'S NOT THE GLOOM AND SCARY 
PICTURE YOU PUT OUT THERE IS IT 
OVERALL CRIME IS STABLE BUT THE 
NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE BEING 
MURDERED ON THE STREET THIS YEAR 
IS RUNNING AT DOUBLE THE RATE THAT 
IT WAS LAST YEAR THAT IS A VERY 
WORRYING TREND 
IF YOU WERE ELECTED 
YOU WOULD MAKE YOURSELF CHAIRMAN OF 
THE POLICE AUTHORITY WHAT GOOD 
WOULD THAT DO 
THE POLICE AUTHORITY 
EFFECTIVELY SELECTS THE 
COMMISSIONER IT DECIDES THE BUDGET 
FOR THE POLICE IT SETS TARGETS FOR 
THE POLICE 
IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT 
THREE DAYS OF YOUR WORK ARE YOU 
PREPARED TO GIVE THAT AMOUNT OF 
TIME TO THIS 
I HAD A MEETING WITH 
THE THE POLICE AUTHORITY THE OTHER 
DAY I CAN CHAIR THE POLICE 
AUTHORITY I HAVE A VERY ABLE 
DEPUTY TO GET INTO THE DETAIL BUT 
IN TERMS OF MAKING THE KEY 
DECISIONS FOR EXAMPLE GETTING THE 
POLICE TO CONCENTRATE ON THOSE 
CRIMES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO 
LOCAL PEOPLE THEN I CAN PUSH PUSH 
THOSE THROUGH 
WHAT ABOUT AN ABLE 
COMMISSIONER IT'S NOT ABOUT 
DIFFERENCES IN THE PAST IT'S ABOUT 
HOW YOU COULD EVER AVOID TENSION OR 
HIM EVEN WANTING TO WORK UNDER YOUR 
AUTHORITY AS COMMISSIONER ISN'T 
IT 
I HAVE HAD I HAD A MEETING IT BEFORE CHRISTMAS WITH IAN BLAIR 
AFTER ALL THE THINGS ABOUT 
STOCKWELL AND THE REST OF IT HAD 
BEEN AIRED IN THE LAST FIVE 
MINUTES OF THAT MEETING HE 
DISMISSED HIS NOTE TAKER HE FELT 
CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO HAVE A ONE TO 
ONE WITH ME AND AT THE END OF THAT 
MEETING 
YOU MIGHT BE CORDIAL BUT MEETING YOU KNOW THE HISTORY YOU KNOW THE 
FACT THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE CONFIDENCE 
IN YOU AT THE MET IF YOU WERE 
ELECTED AND WE HAD A SERIOUS TERROR 
INCIDENT HERE OR WHATEVER WHAT ARE 
LONDONERS TO THINK IF THERE ARE 
TENSIONS AT THE HEART OF THIS 
IMPORTANT ISSUE 
THE CONCLUSION WE 
CAME TO AT THE END OF THAT MEETING 
IS THERE WOULDN'T BE TENSIONS 
BECAUSE NINETY PER CENT OF THE ISSUES WE FACE 
THAT LONDON FACES THAT WE WOULD 
BOTH BE SIGNED UP TO DEALING WITH 
THOSE ISSUES IN A COMMON WAY 
IF HE 
WANTED A SECOND TERM IN A COUPLE OF 
YEARS' TIME THE HOME SECRETARY 
GETS TO DECIDE THAT WOULD YOU 
OPPOSE IT A SECOND TERM FOR HIM 
NO COMMISSIONER HAS EVER IN THE 
HISTORY OF THE MET DONE MORE THAN 
ONE TERM L. DON'T SEE ANY REASON 
WHY WE SHOULD CHANGE THAT 
LOOK WE 
HAVE TACKLED SOME POLICIES LET'S 
HEAR MORE ABOUT YOU 
I THEREFORE DECLARE KEN LIVINGSTONE 
IS ELECTED THE FIRST MAYOR OF 
LONDON 
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE LONDON CONSERVATIVE OR LABOUR TO BECOME 
MAYOR OF LONDON AS KEN LIVINGSTONE 
PROVED WHEN HE WON THE FIRST 
ELECTION FOR THE OFFICE AS AN 
INDEPENDENT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS HOWEVER HAVE THUS 
FAR STRUGGLED TO MAKE AN IMPACT 
THEY'VE BEEN SQUEEZED IN THE 
PREVIOUS TWO MAYORAL ELECTIONS DOWN 
TO AROUND FIFTEEN FOURTEEN PER CENT OF THE VOTES AND 
THE POLLING IS CURRENTLY SHOWING 
THEM LOWER THAN THAT FOLLOWING FOLLOWING THESE RESULTS IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THIS TIME THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS HAD SELECTED FROM 
OUTSIDE THE OBVIOUS PARTY FAITHFUL 
AND HAVE CHOSEN A NON CAREER 
POLITICIAN THE CAPITAL'S ONE TIME 
MOST CONTROVERSIAL POLICEMAN BRIAN 
PADDICK WAS A CENTRE OF NATIONAL 
MEDIA ATTENTION AS A POLICE 
COMMANDER IN LAMB PWELT WHERE HE 
PIONEERED A IN LAMBETH WHERE HE 
PIONEERED AN APPROACH TO DRUG USE 
HE WAS BRIEFLY THE MOST WELL KNOWN 
POLICE OFFICER IN THE CAPITAL 
DESPITE THIS HIGH PROFILE SENIOR 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ADMIT HE IS 
STRUGGLING TO GET THE LEVEL OF 
PUBLIC RECOGNITION THAT HIS MAIN 
RIVALS KEN LIVINGSTONE AND BORIS 
JOHNSON ENJOY 
WE HAVE GROUND TO MAKE UP AND THAT 
IS LARGELY BECAUSE A LOT OF 
LONDONERS DON'T YET KNOW WHO BRIAN 
PADDICK IS HE HAS YET BECOME A 
NATIONAL PERSONALITY 
THE MAYORAL 
CAMPAIGN IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT 
BRIAN PADDICK AND KEN LIVINGSTONE'S 
PATHS HAVE CROSSED WHEN THE 
METROPOLITAN POLICE DECIDED THAT 
BRIAN PADDICK SHOULD BE MOVED FROM 
HIS LAMBETH JOB THE MAYOR KEN 
LIVINGSTONE WAS SPORTIVE 
THE SUP FOR FOR A MAN IN TROUBLE IS 
NOT LIKELY TO BE REPAID HOWEVER 
UNLIKE SOME OTHER CANDIDATES BRIAN 
PADDICK HAS REFUSED TO ENDORSE KEN 
LIVINGSTONE OR ANYONE ELSE AS THE 
MAN LONDONERS SHOULD GIVE THEIR 
SECOND PREFERENCE VOTES TO WITH A 
MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB TO BECOME MAYOR 
IS PERHAPS THE WAY BRIAN PADDICK 
WILL MOST INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF 
THE ELECTION NFPBL INCLUDING 
THERE YOU ARE OF MOST INTEREST FOR 
WHO YOUR SUPPORTERS WILL PUT SECOND 
YOU A KING MAKER BUT NOT A KING 
THE VOTES FOR CLIFFE CLIFF AND 
BORIS JOHNSON ARE SOFT PEOPLE ARE 
HESITANT TO VOTE KEN LIVINGSTONE 
BUT WHEN THEY SEE THERE IS A 
CREDIBLE ALTERNATIVE A LOT OF THE 
SECOND PRE REPSS WHICH FOR ME ARE 
RUNG AT FIFTY THREE PER CENT IN SOME PORBLGS A LOT 
WILL CHANGE TO FIRST DON'T YOU 
THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE A LOAD AND 
SAY TO SUPPORTERS I AM VEERING MORE 
TO THE KOIFRTS MORE TO LABOUR WELL WELL CONSERVATIVES OR MORE TO LABOUR 
I AM IN THIS TO WIN IT L. AM 
CONCENTRATING ON GETTING PEOPLE TO 
VOTE FOR ME 
SIMON HUGHES WAS 
CLOSER TO KEN LIVINGSTONE ARE YOU 
A LIBERAL ALTERNATIVE TO KEN 
LIVINGSTONE 
I AM A LIBERAL LIVINGSTONE DEMOCRAT I HAVE DISTINCTIVE 
POLICIES I HAVE A DISTINCTIVE 
APPROACH THERE IS A LOT THAT MAKES 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS UNIQUE AND 
WHAT I WANT PEOPLE TO DO IS VOTE 
FOR BRIAN PADDICK FIRST PREFERENCE 
BECAUSE I AM CLEARLY ON MOST 
PEOPLE'S MEASURE THE BEST CANDIDATE 
AND THEN WHAT PEOPLE VOTE FOR 
FORESECOND PREFERENCE IS A MATTER 
FOR THEM 
YOU HAVE BEEN A POLICE 
OFFICER HAD A SPELL AS A 
POLITICIAN WHAT IS NEXT 
MAYOR OF 
LONDON AND IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN 
I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY SILLY TO 
MAKE PLANS FOR ANYTHING AFTER THE 
SECOND OF 
BECAUSE I COULD BE 
SECOND OF MAY BECAUSE I COULD BE VERY BUSY DOING SOMETHING ELSE YOU YOU CAN STILL SAY YOU WILL HAVE ENJOYED 
IT IF YOU GET WIPED OUT HERE THE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO GIVE 
LONDONERS A SERIOUS ALTERNATIVE TO 
KEN LIVINGSTONE AND BORIS JOHNSON 
AIN'T IT 
BRIAN PADDICK THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH INDEED THERE ARE MORE 
DETAILS OF BRIAN PADDICK'S POLICIES 
ON THE WEBSITE OF COURSE AND THERE 
IS A PULL LIST OF THE CANDIDATES 
YOU MAY JUST HAVE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE 
OF THEIR NAME TONS SCREEN NEXT 
WEEK IT'S THE TURN OF THE 
CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE BORIS 
JOHNSON WE WILL EXPLORE THE MAN 
AND HIS POLICIES SEE YOU THEN 
NOW BIOFUEL FOR A WHILE THEY 
LOOKED AS THOUGH THEY WERE THE 
SILVER BULLET IN THE CLIMATE CHANGE 
DEBATE A WAY OF POWERING CARS 
WITHOUT BURNING OIL OR COAL AND 
FROM TUESDAY TWO AND A HALF PER CENT OF 
EVERYTHING WE PUT IN OUR TANKS WILL 
BE BIOFUEL THAT IS FUEL MADE FROM 
ANIMAL OR VEGETABLE MATERIAL BUT IS 
IT A GOOD SOLUTION IN THEIR GREEN 
REPUTATION HAS TAKE AN BATTERING 
THEY STAND ACCUSED OF SPEEDING UP 
DEFORESTATION AND CREATING FOOD 
SHORTAGE IN A MOMENT I WILL TALK 
TO ADRIAN RAMSAY BUT FIRST THIS 
REPORT EVERY TIME YOU BURN PETROL 
IN YOUR ENGINE YOU RE LEASE C. O. TWO IF 
THE AIR AND BY NOW WE ALL KNOW THAT 
IS BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BUT 
SOME FUELS ARE MADE OUT OF PLANTS 
LIKE WHEAT SUGAR BEET OR PALM 
THEY ABSORB C. O. TWO AS THEY GROW AND OF 
COURSE YOU CAN GROW MORE FROM 
TUESDAY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF WHAT YOU WILL PUT 
IN YOUR TANK WILL COME FROM THOSE 
CROPS THE THE GOVERNMENT WANTS 
THAT TO RISE TO FIVE PER CENT BY THE END OF 
THE DECADE AND THERE ARE MORE 
AMBITIOUS TARGETS PLANNED AT E. U. 
LEVEL IT WON'T CHANGE THE WAY YOUR 
CAR WORKS BUT IS MEANT TO BE BETTER 
FOR ENVIRONMENT FOR A TIME 
BIOFUELS LOOKED LIKE A CHEAP 
SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS OF CLIMATE 
CHANGE AND ENERGY SUPPLY BUT THERE 
MIGHT BE A HIDDEN COST TO PAY IN 
THE LAST FEW MONTH A NUMBER OF 
CRITICS INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT'S 
OWN CHIEF SCIENTIST HAVE WARNED OF 
THE POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS SIDE 
EFFECTS THAT BIOFUEL DEMAND IS 
HAVING ON THE DEVELOPING WORLD 
THERE ARE REPORTS OF FOOD SHORTAGES 
AND FORESTS BEING DESTROYED TO FOR 
BRITISH FARMERS THE ADVANTAGES OF 
HAVING NEWMARKETS FOR CROP ARE 
OBVIOUS CROPS BUT PETER 
PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL FARMERS' 
UNION ALSO THINKS HOME GROWN 
BIOFUELS WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY 
GREEN 
WE THINK IT'S A GREAT GREEN OPPORTUNITY FOR FARMERS NOT JUST TO 
BE PRODUCERS OF FOOD BUT SUPPLIERS 
OF ENERGY SO THERE IS A REAL 
POTENTIAL TO KICK START THE 
TECHNOLOGY THAT WE BELIEVE CAN DO 
THINGS MUCH SMARTER IN THE FUTURE 
WITH EITHER CROP GROWING BEHIND ME 
HERE THE WHEAT OR EVEN THE STRAW 
IN THE FUTURE OR EVEN THE ANIMAL 
MANURES THAT COME FROM LIVESTOCK 
FARMING THIS IS A GREAT POTENTIAL 
TO USE PRODUCTS THAT ARE DELIVERED 
YEAR AFTER YEAR BY THE RAYS OF THE 
SUN TO POWER OR TRANSPORT FOR THE 
LONG TERM 
THE SUGAR BEET BEING LONG TERM PLANTED AT THIS FARM IN NORFOLK 
WILL BE TRANSFORMED INTO ETHANOL AT 
THE BRITISH SUGAR REFINERY NEARBY 
ACCORDING TO THE COMPANY THE 
PROCESS HERE IS EXTREMELY GREEN 
THE CROP DOESN'T HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR 
NOTHING OF THE PLANT IS WASTED AND 
THE FUEL IS PRODUCED USING SIXTY PER CENT LESS 
CARBON COMPARED TO PETROL BUT THE 
VAST MAJORITY OF BIOFUELS ARE 
PRODUCED ABROAD AND IT IS THOSE 
THAT HAVE COME UNDER ATTACK THE U. K. 
INDUSTRY FEARS ITS PRODUCT WILL BE 
TARRED WITH THE SAME BRUSH THE 
INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVE WARNS THAT 
GOING AHEAD WITH THE TARGETS IS 
CRUCIAL TO GIVE COMPANYS THE 
INCENTIVE TO RESEARCH EVEN GREENER 
ALTERNATIVES 
IF THE CALLS FOR A ALTERNATIVES MORATORIUM ON BIOFUEL PRODUCTION IN 
THIS COUNTRY ARE TAKEN SERIOUSLY 
AND THE GOVERNMENT DECIDES THAT 
THEY WILL STOP THAT WOULD BE A 
DISASTER FOR THE BIOFUELS INDUSTRYS 
IN THIS COUNTRY AND IF THE 
BIOFUELS INDUSTRY DISAPPEARS 
BECAUSE THERE IS NO INVESTMENT 
THERE WILL BE NOBODY IN THIS 
COUNTRY TO DELIVER THE CARBON 
SAVINGS WE WANT NOR WILL THERE BE 
ANYBODY TO LEAD THE WAY IN EUROPE 
AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING AND NOR 
WOULD WE HAVE ANY LEG TO STAND ON 
TO BE TELLING PEOPLE IN THE REST OF 
THE WORLD WHO WILL CONTINUE TO 
PRODUCE BIOFUELS THAT THEY MUST 
PRODUCE IT SUSTAINIBLY THE THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS HAVE BEEN TAKEN 
ABACK BY THE FURORE IT HAS ORDERED 
A RERUE ON THE CROPS WHICH WILL 
REPORT IN LATE MAY IT IS EXPECTED 
TO HAVE A HUGE INFLUENCE IN THE WAY 
THE U. K. NEGOTIATES IN EUROPE NEXT 
YEAR WHEN COUNTRIES WILL AGREE 
HIGHER TARGETS AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
STANDARDS BUT FUTURE SAFEGUARDS 
AREN'T ENOUGH THEY SAY BIOFUELS 
HAVE TO BE MADE SUSTAINABLE BEFORE 
THEY ARE FORCIBLY INTRODUCED AT THE 
PUMP 
THERE AREN'T ANY STANDARDS PUMP THERE AT THE MOMENT THAT HAVE 
INTRODUCED THE TARGET WITHOUT THE 
STANDARDS SO THEY DO I THINK NEED 
TO DRAW BREATH SAY HANG ON ARE WE 
SURE WHAT WE ARE DO ISN'T GOING TO 
SPOIL THE ENVIRONMENT THE WITH 
POINT IS TO MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT A 
BETTER PLACE AND THERE IS NO GRN 
TEE AT THE MOMENT WE WILL BE DOING 
THAT 
GUARANTEE NEXT WEEK'S THAT TARGETS COME WITH A REQUIREMENT FOR 
MANUFACTURER TO EXPLAIN HOW THE 
FUEL IS PRODUCED AND WHAT CORE BON 
SAVINGS IT AP CHEEVS THE 
GOVERNMENT WANTS TO USE THAT 
INFORMATION TO SET UP COMPULSORY 
STAN CARDS BY TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND MINISTERS 
SAY THEY ARE EXPORTING BREAST 
BEST PRACTICE TO THE REST OF EUROPE 
WHAT WE ARE DOING THIS WEEK IS THAT THE RENEWABLE FUELS AGENCY 
WILL BE REQUIRED FROM HERE ON IN TO 
REPORT TO PARLIAMENT ON A QUARTERLY 
BAY SIS WHAT THE SUSTAINABILITY IS 
WHAT THE IMPACT IS ON THOSE 
COUNTRIES AND THE GREENHOUSE GAS 
REDUCTIONS AND HOW THAT WILL IMPACT 
ON OUR ATTEMPT TO REDUCE CARBON SO 
PARLIAMENT WILL HAVE EVIDENCE 
EVERY QUARTER FROM HERE ON IN AND 
AFTER THAT AND DURING THE COURSE OF 
THOSE REPORTS TO PARLIAMENT WE 
WILL BE ARGUING IN EUROPE FOR 
MANDATORY STANDARD TO BE INTRODUCED 
WITHIN THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION 
FOOD SHORTAGES ARE ROUND THE WORLD 
ARE BECOMING PRESSING PROBLEM 
TRADE DEALS ARE CHIEFLY TO BLAME 
BUT BIOFUELS ALSO PLAY A PART SOME 
WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A 
MORATORIUM ON THEIR USE BUT IF WE 
A ABANDON THEM NOW IT IS NOT CLEAR 
WHERE CLEANER FUELS ARE GOING TO 
COME FROM AM JOINED BY ADRIAN 
RAMSAY FROM THE GREEN PARTY THANK 
YOU FOR COMING IN NO ONE IS 
ADVOCATING CUTTING DOWN RAINFOREST 
BUT YOU OPPOSE GROWING CROPS FOR 
ANY BIOFUELS 
WELL CUTTING DOWN 
THE RAINFOREST IS HAPPENING AND 
THERE ARE FOOD RIOTS HAPPENING IN 
MANY PARTS OF THE DEVELOPING WORD 
WITH FOOD PRICES INCREASING THAT 
IS GOING TO GET WORSE AS WE SEE 
HIGHER TARGETS FOR BIOFUELS IN THE 
U. K. AND OTHER COUNTRIES IT IS NOT 
THE ANSWER 
SO NONE AT ALL 
NOT ON 
THE LARGE SCALE WE SEE HAPPEN AGO 
T. T. MOMENT IT IS NOT AN ANSWER IN 
TERMS OF FOOD PRICES IT WILL ONLY 
SEE FOOD PRICES GO UP AS 
AGRICULTURAL LAND IS GROWN FOR FUEL 
RATHER THAN FOOD IT IS NOT THE 
ANSWER ON CARBON EMISSIONS I WOULD 
TAKE EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY YEAR TO RECLAIM THE CARBON 
HOW MUCH LAND IS LOST TO BIOFUELS 
AT THE MOMENT 
WELL THE POINT IS 
HOW MUCH WOULD BE LOST GIVEN THE 
TARGETS THAT ARE COMING IN ON 
TUESDAY FOR TWENTY FIVE PER CENT AND FIVE PER CENT FROM TWO THOUSAND TEN 
THE UN SAYS IT IS FIFTEEN PER CENT THAT HAS 
BEEN LOST TO BIOFUELS YOU CAN'T 
BLAME ALL FOOD RICES ON BIOFUELS 
CAN YOU 
WELL GORDON BROWN AND 
OTHERS HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT ONE OF 
THE REASONS FOR INCREASES IN PRICES 
OF FOOD ACROSS THE WORLD IS 
BIOFUELS BUT THE POINT IS THAT WILL 
GET MUCH WORSE IF WE SEE THESE 
TARGETS COMING IN ON TUESDAY AND 
FUTURE E. ULT TARGETS MAKING THE 
SITUATION MORE SEVERE WOULDN'T WOULDN'T YOUR POSITION HAVE A BIT MORE 
CREDIBILITY IF YOU SAID WHAT WE 
NEED IS BETTER BIOFUELS NOT NO 
BIOFUELS 
WELL THE IDEA OF THE BIOFUELS SECOND GENERATION BIOFUELS THAT 
HAVE BEEN MOOTED A LONG WAY OFF AND 
THE TARGETS ARE COMING IN NOW WITH 
THE GOVERNMENT I WOULD SAY BEING 
FAR TOO PRECIPITATIVE TO BRING IT 
IN BEFORE THE RESEARCH HAS HAPPENED 
WE HEARD IN THE FILM FROM THE 
RENEWABLE ENERGY ASSOCIATION THAT 
MORE TER ARE YUM WOULD BE A 
DISASTER 
I DON'T THINK O. MORE DISASTER TER YUM ANYTHING OTHER THAN A MORE 
TER YUM WOULD BE A DISASTER WHAT 
WE NEED TO DO IS LOOK AT THE WAYS 
WE CAN REDUCE EMISSIONS THAT WE CAN 
HAVE CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGIES NOT 
BIOFUELS WHICH ARE NOT A GREEN 
ANSWER AT ALL 
SO THEY HAVE NO PART 
TO PLAY WHATSOEVER 
NOT ON THE 
LARGE SCALE THAT IS BEEN TALKED 
ABOUT IF WE SEE BIOFUELS BEING ROW 
DEUCED WITHIN THE U. K. IT IS ONLY 
GOING TO MEAN THAT FOOD IS IMPORTED 
FURTHER DISTANCES AND THAT WILL ADD 
TO CARBON EMISSIONS IT IS NOT THE 
RIGHT WAY FORWARD 
YOU ARE SAYING 
YOU ARE LINKINGING IT CLEARLY WITH 
FOOD PRICES THE UN SAY ONLY FIFTEEN PER CENT 
OF AGRICULTURAL LAND IS BEING GIVEN 
OVER TO BIOFUELS SO THE INCREASES 
AND NO ONE IS DYING DENYING THEY 
ARE TAKING PLACE IS NOT JUST DOWN 
TO BIOFUELSFUL
