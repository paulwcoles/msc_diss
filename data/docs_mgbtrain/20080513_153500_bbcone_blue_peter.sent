IN THIS SPECTACULAR THE PERFORMER RIDES A MOTORBIKE HORIZONTALLY 
AROUND A VERTICAL WALL 
PREPARE TO HOLD ON TIGHT ZOE BECAUSE FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE 
YOU WILL BE RIDING THE WALL OF DEATH OH ONE MORE THING 
YOU WON'T BE SITTING ON THE SADDLE YOU'LL BE RIDING ON THE HANDLEBARS 
ALSO TODAY THERE'S MORE ADVENTURES IN CHINA 
WHEN ANDY AND I MEET TWO CHILDREN WITH VERY DIFFERENT LIVES 
ONE IN THE CITY AND ONE IN THE COUNTRY 
I'VE HAD AN ABSOLUTE SOAKING 
HELLO BLUE PETER IS ON THE ROAD THIS WEEK 
WE'VE GOT SOME CRACKING CHALLENGES FOR YOU ZOE'S UP FIRST TODAY 
YOU'VE HAD TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT ARE YOU READY I A. M. READY 
I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE WALL OF DEATH THE WALL OF DEATH 
OOH SOUNDS AWFUL IT SOUNDS DEATHLY 
I'M GLAD IT'S YOU THAT'S DOING IT WITH SOME HELP YOU READY GUYS 
THEY'RE GONNA TRAIN YOU COME ON 
FIRESTARTER BY THE PRODIGY 
NO WAY 
AEROBATICS ON THE BIKE HANDS UP AND EVERYTHING 
FANTASTIC TO WATCH BUT SCARY I'M GLAD I'M NOT DOING IT 
THANKS GETHIN IT LOOKS SO DIFFICULT RIDING THE BIKE 
AROUND THE INSIDE OF THE WALL WHAT PROBLEMS WILL ZOE FACE 
WHILE SAT ON THE HANDLEBARS 
DIZZINESS AND CONSCIOUSNESS AND THINGS 
THAT'S A BIG DEAL THE DIZZINESS 
CAN SHE FOCUS ON ONE PLACE 
OR WHAT DOES SHE DO NOT REALLY 
SHE'S GOT TO LISTEN TO LUKE TO CALM DOWN I MIGHT HAVE MY EYES CLOSED 
IF I WAS YOU I'D LISTEN TO LUKE 
KERRY WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DRIVING THE GO KART 
AND THE BIKE 
THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THE TYRE AND THE POSITION 
I AM FLAT ON THE WALL 
SO I HAVE THE WHOLE SURFACE OF THE TYRE TO PLAY WITH 
WITH THE BIKE BECAUSE YOU'RE AT A FORTY FIVE DEGREE ANGLE 
YOU'RE ON THE EDGE OF THE TYRE NO EASY RIDE FOR YOU ON THE GO KART 
IT LOOKED FAST HOW FAST ARE WE TALKING 
FORTY FIVE FIFTY MILES AN HOUR THAT'S FAST EVEN IN A CAR 
IT'S A CONFINED AREA AND IT'S A LOT FASTER 
YOU WERE DOING THINGS WITH YOUR ARMS WHICH IS GREAT 
BUT PLEASE DON'T DO THAT 
YOU CAN DO THE STUNTS INSTEAD 
YOU'RE IN SAFE HANDS THERE WE'LL SEE THAT LATER 
NOW CHINA IS A HUGE COUNTRY 
WITH AMAZING AND VERY COLOURFUL LIFESTYLES

BETWEEN COUNTRY LIFE AND CITY LIFE

OF ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE OH THE REASON I'M TELLING YOU THIS 
IS BECAUSE THIS PICTURE WAS DRAWN IN THE EXACT PLACE I'M STOOD NOW

I JUST HOPE THAT I DON'T YOU KNOW FALL THIS WAY 
COS IT IS GOING THAT WAY YEAH 
SURELY ZOE WILL WEAR PROTECTIVE GEAR LUKE 
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO SHE'S ONLY SAT THERE AND SHE NEEDS TO FEEL HERSELF 
AND FEEL THE BIKE MOVE BENEATH HER 
A HELMET WILL BE TOO HEAVY ON HER HEAD BECAUSE OF THE G. FORCE 
IT'LL WEIGH THREE TIMES AS MUCH AND MIGHT CONK ME ON THE HEAD 
AND KNOCK ME OUT I DON'T WANT TO KNOCK HIM OUT HE'S DRIVING 
WHO WOULD DRIVE YOU'D HAVE TO TAKE CONTROL 
THERE'S MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE TO THIS WALL OF DEATH YES 
IF YOU WERE WONDERING WHERE IT ALL STARTED LOOK AT THIS 
EVER WONDERED WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO RIDE UP A WALL ON A MOTORBIKE 
IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE SOMETHING FROM A HOLLYWOOD FILM 
BUT THE WALL OF DEATH IS A DAREDEVIL STUNT DATING BACK 
TO THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS 
THE WALL OF DEATH WAS ORIGINALLY A CARNIVAL ACT 
FEATURING MOTORCYCLES THAT DEFIED GRAVITY BY RIDING HORIZONTALLY 
AROUND CIRCULAR VERTICAL WALLS 
OVER THE YEARS THE WALL OF DEATH HAS EVOLVED 
TO INCLUDE EVEN MORE OUTRAGEOUS TRICKS 
RIDING WITHOUT HOLDING ON 
DRIVING CARS ON THE TRACK AND AS WE'LL SEE TODAY 
PEOPLE RIDING ON HANDLEBARS 
THESE DAYS HIGH TECH FAIRGROUND RIDES HAVE LARGELY TAKEN OVER 
AND THERE ARE ONLY A HANDFUL OF WALLS OF DEATH LEFT 
MAKING THIS A VERY RARE AND SPECIAL CHALLENGE 
SO IN FACT ZOE YOU'RE VERY LUCKY TO BE DOING THIS STUNT TODAY 
I LOVE A RARE CHALLENGE LUKE WHAT IS NEXT 
WE'LL GET YOU ON THE TRACK GET YOU USED TO THE FEELING OF THE BIKE 
THE TRACK MAKES A TRANSITION BETWEEN THE FLOOR AND WALL NINETY DEGREES 
JUST GET YOU USED TO IT O. K. 
OFF YOU GO COME ON LET'S SEE IT THEN 
NEEDLESS TO SAY THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS STUNT 
IF YOU HAVEN'T TRAINED FOR THIS 
DON'T SIT ON THE HANDLEBARS OF ANY BIKE 
WHEN SHE'S NOT FLYING AROUND ON A MOTORCYCLE 
SHE'S ALSO AWARDING ONE OF YOU GUYS WITH A BLUE PETER BADGE 
GOOD LUCK ZOE 
BY THE RIGHT QUICK MARCH 
I'M HERE AT THE BARRACKS IN HOLYWOOD IN NORTHERN IRELAND TO SURPRISE ANNA 
SHE EMAILED TO TELL US ABOUT ALL THE CHARITY WORK SHE DOES 
SO WE THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH A TRIP TO GIVE HER ONE OF THESE 
SQUAD 
HALT 
ANNA 
HELLO HI COME ON OVER AND JOIN US 
DO YOU RECOGNISE ME I'M IN DISGUISE I'M ZOE FROM BLUE PETER 
HELLO I'VE COME HERE TO SEE YOU BECAUSE WE GOT YOUR EMAIL 
ABOUT ALL THE FANTASTIC CHARITY WORK YOU'VE DONE 
WE LOVED WHAT YOU DID HELPING OUT A FRIEND'S FAMILY WHO LOST THEIR DAD 
SO WE'VE COME TO GIVE YOU YOUR VERY OWN BLUE PETER BADGE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT THANK YOU 
LET'S PUT IT ON YOU 
THERE YOU GO ARE YOU SURPRISED TO SEE US 
IT'S A BIT OF A SHOCK YOU SAID YOU REALLY WANTED A BLUE PETER BADGE 
SO WE THOUGHT WELL YOU'VE DONE YOUR BIT TO DESERVE IT DEFINITELY 
THERE YOU GO CONGRATULATIONS 
I'M REALLY REALLY SURPRISED 
AW WELL DONE 
FANTASTIC AW IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD 
BLUE PETER'S ON THE ROAD THIS WEEK SPENDING OUR TIME AT THE FUNFAIR 
BUT WHILE I'M HAVING A GOOD TIME ZOE'S INSIDE PRACTISING LIKE MAD 
FOR HER WALL OF DEATH STUNT 
KERRY AND ALEX HAVE KEPT AN EYE ON HER HOW'S SHE DOING 
REALLY WELL EXCELLENT ZOE SMILES A LOT 
BUT BENEATH THAT SMILE IS THERE FEAR DO YOU THINK YEAH 
THERE'S ALWAYS SOME ANXIETY BUT SHE'LL ENJOY IT I'D BE SCARED 
ALEX HOW DID YOU GET STARTED IN THIS 
MY DAD'S DONE IT ALL HIS LIFE AND HIS DAD AND HIS DAD AS WELL 
SO MY DAD'S TAUGHT MY BROTHER AND THEY BOTH TAUGHT ME SO I DO IT TOO 
WHAT'S THE HARDEST THING ABOUT DOING IT 
GOING FROM THE BANKING TRACK ONTO THE WALL 
IF YOU DON'T GET THAT LIP RIGHT YOU FLIP STRAIGHT BACK OFF 
YOU'RE GOING ROUND VERY QUICKLY YOU CAN GET DIZZY LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS 
HAVE YOU EVER BLACKED OUT OR FAINTED 
YES YOU HAVE WHAT HAPPENED 
IT'S LIKE AS IT SAYS IT ALL JUST GOES BLACK 
AND YOU LOSE YOUR VISION FOR A MATTER OF SECONDS YOU JUST CLINCH ON 
AND MAKE SURE THE BLOOD GETS BACK TO YOUR HEAD AGAIN 
I SUPPOSE IT DOESN'T HELP IF IT'S A HOT DAY EITHER NO 
THE BLOOD'S THINNER THEN SO TODAY'S HOT ZOE'S NEVER DONE IT BEFORE 
IT'S A BIG CHALLENGE SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT SHE'S WITH PROFESSIONALS 
O. K. IF YOU'RE THINKING HOW DOES THIS WORK 
HOW DO THEY STAY ON THE WALL YOU ARE ABOUT TO FIND OUT 
WHEN THE BIKE MOVES AROUND THE INSIDE OF THE WALL 
GRAVITY TRIES TO PULL IT DOWN 
HOWEVER THERE ARE FORCES ACTING AGAINST GRAVITY THAT KEEP IT UP 
THE CENTRIPETAL FORCE PUSHES AN OBJECT INWARDS 
SO THE BIKE WILL MOVE IN A CIRCLE 
THE FASTER THE BIKE GOES THE STRONGER THE PUSH 
THIS PUSH KEEPS THE BIKE ON THE WALL 
ANOTHER FORCE IS FRICTION THIS STOPS THE WHEELS FROM SLIPPING DOWN 
THE FASTER THE BIKE MOVES THE MORE FRICTION 
AND THE MORE THE BIKE GRIPS THE WALL 
IF THE BIKE SLOWS DOWN THERE WILL BE LESS FRICTION TO GRIP THE WALL 
AND IT WOULD FALL OFF 
SO IT'S PROVEN BY SCIENCE TO BE O. K. DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL ANY BETTER 
IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER THAT SCIENTIFICALLY IT'LL ALL WORK OUT 
SO HOPEFULLY IN REAL LIFE IT WILL ALL WORK OUT TOO 
I FEEL BETTER NOW I'VE HAD A TEST GO BUT I KNOW IT'LL GET HARDER 
THE FUNNIEST BIT IS YOUR HEAD IT'S FACING ONE WAY 
REALLY REALLY FUNNY GOOD LUCK 
YOU HAVE MINUTES TO PREPARE BEFORE TAKING ON THE WALL OF DEATH 
BEFORE THAT LET'S HEAD BACK TO CHINA 
IN THE HUANG HOUSEHOLD KEEPING BABY CORMORANTS IN THE LIVING ROOM 
IS QUITE NORMAL 
THEY'RE SO CUTE 
HAVE SOME FOOD 
THE FATHER JUST TOLD ME HE KNOWS WHAT NOISE THEY MAKE 
WHICH MEANS THEY'RE HUNGRY COLD OR HOT 
IT'S A BIT LIKE HAVING A PET AT HOME LIKE A CAT 
WHEN THEY CRY YOU KNOW WHAT IT WANTS 
WE'VE SET OURSELVES A CHALLENGE 
WE'LL TRY AND DO A PORTRAIT OF DAD I'LL DO THE HEAD 
O. K. THEN YOU DO THE BODY IS THAT COOL HERE WE GO 
IT'S LIKE MY MUM IT'S MEANT TO BE YOUR DAD 
OFF FISHING 
I LOVE IT WHEN THE CORMORANTS START LOOKING FOR FOOD 
THEY PLUNGE THEIR HEAD INTO THE WATER 
YOU CAN SEE THEIR BEAUTIFUL GREEN EYES THROUGH THE WATER 
LOOKING FOR FISH 
IT'S NOT BAD 
FISHING WITH CORMORANTS WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED IN BRITAIN 
BECAUSE THEIR NECKS HAVE TO BE TIED BUT IT'S A TRADITION 
GOING BACK HUNDREDS OF YEARS 
BECAUSE THERE WERE FEW FISH LEFT IN THE LAKE WE USED DEAD ONES AS BAIT 
IT'S TIME TO GO FISHING AND GET SOME FOOD 
GOT ONE 
ARE THEY FIGHTING OVER IT 
HAS HE GOT ONE 
I CAN'T SEE HE HAS 
IT'S IN HIS MOUTH HE CAN'T SWALLOW IT BECAUSE OF THE CORD 
IT SEEMS CRUEL BECAUSE IT WOULD LOVE TO EAT THE FISH BUT IT'S A TRADITION 
THAT'S BEING GOING ON HERE FOR YEARS 
IT'S THE WAY THE FAMILY EAT AS WELL 
ONE DOWN I'VE HAD A SOAKING LET'S GO FOR ANOTHER 
DO YOU WANT TO COME AND SEE THAT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE FACE 
LOOK HE'S GOT IT HE'S TRYING TO SWALLOW IT 
DO YOU ENJOY BEING OUT IN THE BOAT YES 
I THOUGHT YOU NEEDED PATIENCE FOR FISHING NOT WITH THESE GUYS 
WINNERS 
AFTER LUNCH LO PEI AND HER FRIEND TOOK ME ROUND SOME ART GALLERIES 
DO YOU HAVE THESE THINGS IN ENGLAND YEAH WE HAVE GALLERIES
