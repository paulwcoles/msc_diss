HIS WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN COMMUNITY CENTRED AROUND HIS FRIENDS HE 
WOULD GO DOWN TO THE PUB FOR A 
COUPLE OF HEARTHS AND BET HIS

THINK WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON AND 
WE CAN HELP EACH OTHER 
HAVE YOU

BEEN COMING HERE WITH HIS FRIENDS 
DEFINITELY HE LOOKS FORWARD TO THE 
NEXT DAY NOW BEFORE HE WAS 
MISERABLE HE IS NOT MISERABLE NOW 
YOU LIKE THE SOCIAL LIFE DO YOU 
ALL OF THE PEOPLE AROUND 
I LIKE A 
BIT OF A JOKE MYSELF 
THAT WAS JACK HAMMOND ENJOYING A 
DRINK WITH HIS NEW FRIENDS JOINING 
US ARE KATE ADAMS FROM HELP THE 
AGED AND SUSAN ROWLEY WHO IS HERE 
WITH HER CHILDREN SHE STARTED 
SCHEME CALLED ADOPT A GRANNY MORE 
ON THAT IN COUPLE OF MINUTES IT 
SEEMS EXTRAORDINARY THAT HE HAD TO 
GO TO THESE LENGTHS TO PAY 
SOMEBODY TO GO WITH HIS FATHER TO 
THE PUB ARE THINGS REALLY THAT 
BAD 
IT IS A PROBLEM THAT HELP THE BAD AGED IS IDENTIFYING IT IS 
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT SOCIAL 
ISOLATION IS A REAL PROBLEM 
RESEARCH THAT WE CARRIED OUT LAST 
YEAR FOUND THAT THERE WERE FOURTEEN 
MILLION OLD PEOPLE THAT WERE SAYING 
THEY WERE FEELING SOCIALLY ISOLATED 
BACK HOME IN WALES WE HAD OLD AGE 
PENSIONERS RIGHT NEXT TO OUR YOUTH 
C. L. U. B. WE HAD INCREDIBLE INTERACTION 
CLUB WE HAD INCREDIBLE INTERACTION WHAT ELSE CAN BE DONE 
HELP THE 
AGED IS A NATIONAL CHARITY AND HAS 
A RANGE OF SERVICES AND SUPPORT TO 
PROVIDE TWO OLDER PEOPLE WE HAD 
TWO PROJECTS THAT ARE REALLY QUITE 
INTERESTING ONE IS CALLED MY HOME 
LIFE IT LOOKS AT HOW WE CAN 
DEVELOP THE BEST POSSIBLE PRACTICE 
IN RESIDENTIAL CARE HOMES WE ARE 
WORKING WITH PARTNERS TO LOOK AT 
HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE 
EXPERIENCE OF THOSE HOMES IS THE 
BEST POSSIBLE THE OTHER PROGRAMME 
IS THAT WE PROVIDE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO 
GRANT FUNDING WE OFFER THAT TOO 
SMALL LOCAL ORGANISATIONS WE 
ORGANISE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM 
TO SOCIALISE WE PAY FOR PEOPLE TO 
HAVE A TRIP TO THE SEASIDE AND FISH 
AND CHIPS WORE A CREAM TEA IN 
THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY CENTRE OR A 
PICNIC OUT IN THE PARK IT IS GOOD 
TO GET TOGETHER AND SOCIALISE 
SUZANNE YOU ARE TRIED TO TACKLE 
THIS PROBLEM YOU HAVE THE SCHEME 
ADOPT A GRANNY WHAT WAS BEHIND THE 
INSPIRATION FOR IT 
MY HUSBAND AND 
I WERE TALKING ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO 
ABOUT OUR TWO CHILDREN AND THE FACT 
THEY DID NOT HAVE GRANDPARENTS IN 
THEIR LIVES WE THOUGHT THERE MUST 
BE SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE 
FAMILIES WHO DO NOT HAVE 
GRANDPARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS WHO 
DO NOT HAVE FAMILY EITHER LOCAL TO 
THEM OR IT DOES NOT EXIST WHO WHO GETS THE MOST OUT OF THE 
RELATIONSHIP 
I THINK BOTH PARTIES RELATIONSHIP BENEFIT IN THE PAPER REVIEW ON 
LAST WEEK'S SHOW SHE TALKED ABOUT 
HER GRANDSON'S AND HER EYES LIT UP 
WE HAVE FAMILIES WHERE PERHAPS THE 
MOTHER WANTS A FRIEND SOMEBODY 
PERHAPS OLDER AND WISER THE 
GRANDCHILDREN WANT SOMEBODY 
DIFFERENT TO TAKE TO SPORTSDAY 
APART FROM MAM AND DAD 
YOU TALKED 
ABOUT THE SORT OF THING IS THAT 
HELP THE AGED IS DOING IS THERE A 
RE ATIONSHIP 
THAT WE FORGET A 
REALLY IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN GRANDFATHERS AND 
GRANDCHILDREN 
IT IS REALLY ABOUT GRANDCHILDREN WHAT FAMILIES ARE ABOUT THOSE 
GENERATIONS COMING TOGETHER AND 
LEARNING FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF THE 
OLDER GENERATION BEING ABLE TO 
PROVIDE SOME INFLUENCE TO YOUNGER 
PEOPLE 
SUZANNE WHAT CAN PEOPLE DO PEOPLE FOR YOU THEY GET IN CONTACT WITH 
YOU BUT IS A PEOPLE WHO LIVE NEAR 
THEM 
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THEM RELATIONSHIP THE PARTIES ARE 
LOOKING FOR SOME PEOPLE WANT 
SOMEONE ON THEIR DOORSTEP SOME 
PEOPLE WANT SOMEONE A LITTLE 
DISTANCE AWAY SO IT IS A SPECIAL 
TRIP TO SEE THEM 
A WHAT SHOULD 
PEOPLE DO IF THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT 
SOMEBODY AN OLDER PERSON WATCHING 
THIS AND THEY WANT TO GET IN 
CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHAT DO 
YOU DO 
THERE ARE A RANGE OF 
SERVICES AND SUPPORT OUT THERE IF 
PEOPLE MAKE CONTACT WITH THE 
PROGRAMME NUMBERS THEY CAN GET 
PASSED ON TO THE INFORMATION L. 
THINK COMMUNITIES ARE ALIVE AND 
WELL SOMETIMES MAKING THOSE 
CONNECTIONS BETWEEN YOUNG AND OLD 
NEEDS HELP PEOPLE WHO HAVE TIME ON 
THEIR HANDS AND MIGHT WANT TO 
BEFRIEND SOMEBODY WHO IS OLDER 
THERE ARE MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE 
CAMPAIGNS AND ADOPT GRANNY ON OUR WEBSITE WEBSITE IS THAT WHAT IT IS LIKE WAY YOU 
LIVE WHAT IDEAS HAVE YOU GOT FOR 
MAKING THINGS BETTER WE WOULD LIKE

SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE CONFLICT TO 
RESOLVE THE GLOBAL THREAT OF 
TERROR 
THERE IS NO RELIGION THAT I TERROR KNOW THAT PROMOTES VIOLENCE PEOPLE 
IN THE WORLD ARE ANGRY ANGRY 
WITH THE WEST BECAUSE THEY REALISE 
THAT A LOT OF THEIR SUFFERING IS 
NOT DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE 
LAZY IT IS THAT THE WEST HAS BY 
AND LARGE WRITTEN THE RULES OF THE 
GAME AND THEN BEEN PLAYER AND 
REFEREE IN THE GAME THE RULES 
FAVOUR THE P. O. W. FOUR WE WILL NOT WIN 
WHAT PEOPLE CALL OF WAR AGAINST 
TERROR AS LONG AS THERE ARE

GENUINELY FEEL I WAS IN THE 
PRESENCE OF AN ICON HE IS 
UNIVERSALLY RESPECTED WORLDWIDE A 
FASCINATING CHARACTER TO BE AROUND 
WATCHING THAT IT WAS MOVING WHEN 
HE TALKED ABOUT DEATH THREATS TO 
HIS FAMILY 
YES HE WAS WORRIED 
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT COULD 
POSSIBLY HAVE STOPPED HIM FROM 
CONTINUING BEING SUCH AN ACTIVE 
CAMPAIGNER AGAINST APARTHEID ONCE

HIS WIFE SAID GO FOR IT HE WAS 
LIKE I'M GOING TO SOLDIER ON AND

HANGED IN BRIDGEND SINCE THE START 
OF LAST YEAR EIGHTEEN PEOPLE UNDER THE 
AGE OF TWENTY SEVEN HAD APPARENTLY TAKEN 
THEIR LIVES IN THE COUNTY 
WHAT IS 
HAPPENING HAS HAD A PARTICULAR 
RESONANCE FOR THE PEOPLE OF ARE 
GOING IN BELFAST BECAUSE FIVE 
YEARS AGO THEY HAD A NUMBER OF 
SUICIDES AMONG YOUNG MEN OR 
DOREEN THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN 
WORKING TO ENSURE THERE ARE TANIA 
MOORE THERE ARE NO MORE TRAGEDIES 
THREE MILES FROM THE CENTRE OF 
BELFAST IS A DISTRICT COURT ON 
TOURING ON ITS EDGE IS A CHURCH 
COURT HOLY CROSS ONE DAY IN APRIL 
TWO THOUSAND THREE A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD ARRIVED HERE 
BUT INSTEAD OF GOING INSIDE HE 
MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE CHURCHYARD 
TO THE TREE WHERE HE HAD PLAYED AS 
A BOY AFTER A SERIES OF CALLS TO 
HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS HE TOOK HIS 
LIFE 
FIVE YEARS LATER THE TREE IS A 
SHRINE OFTEN VISITED BY PIT'S 
DAD PHILIP 
HE MUST HAVE BEEN IN 
SUCH TURMOIL HE MUST HAVE BEEN IN 
A LOT OF PAIN HE WALKED ALONG THIS 
PATHWAY AND ENDED HIS LIFE FROM 
THAT MOMENT ON TWENTY THIRD APRIL TWO THOUSAND THREE MY 
LIFE AND HIS FAMILY'S LIVES CHANGED 
FOREVER 
HIS BODY WAS DISCOVERED BY ONE OF 
THE PRIESTS AT HER LEA CROSS FOR 
FATHER AIDAN TROY THIS WAS THE 
START OF TERRIBLE SERIES OF 
EVENTS AT HOLY CROSS 
I CAN 
ALWAYS REMEMBER THE FUNERAL WAS 
HELD IN THIS CHURCH AND IT WAS 
JUST COVERED WALL TO WALL AS 
AGAINST THE NORMAL PROFILE OF 
ATTENDANCE THEY WERE ALL YOUNG 
THEY ALL HAD FOR ME LOOKING FROM 
THE ALTAR A ON THEIR FACE WHY 
A QUESTION ON THEIR FACE 
WHY DID 
HE DO IT HE WAS TURNING EIGHTEEN IN A 
FEW MONTHS HE HAD A LOT TO LOOK 
FORWARD TO HE HAD ONLY STARTED A 
NEW JOB L. AM STILL HAUNTED BY THAT 
MY OWN SON COULDN'T COME AND TALK 
TO ME ABOUT WHAT REASONS HE'D HAVE 
FOR DOING SOMETHING I GUESS THE THE FUNERAL WAS THE FIRST FATHER 
TRAILLE TO HOLD FOLLOWING THE 
SUICIDE BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE THE 
LAST FATHER AIDAN TROY IN THE 
PERIOD OF TWO YEARS MORE THAN A 
DOZEN YOUNG PEOPLE COMMITTED 
SUICIDE IN NORTH BELFAST 
THEY WERE 
RESTORING THE CHURCH AND A YOUNG 
LAD CLIMBED THE SCAFFOLDING AND 
HUNG HIMSELF FROM ONE OF THE HEIGHT 
HOWLERS HE HAD BEEN HERE THAT 
MORNING AT THE FUNERAL OF HIS BEST 
FRIEND WHO HAD HUNG HIMSELF AT HOME 
HIKED HOW WAS SUICIDE IS A 
HIKED HOW WAS SUICIDE IS A PERMANENT ANSWER TO A TEMPORARY 
PROBLEM I KNOW IF I OR YOU OR THE 
YOUNG PERSON IS DEPRESSED MAY BE 
NO WORK NO MONEY NO FRIENDS IT 
IS VERY HARD TO SAY THAT IS A 
TEMPORARY PROBLEM IT IS ALL 
ENCOMPASSING I HAVE SAT WITH YOUNG 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO HOPE THAT IS 
WHY I NOW UNDERSTAND A LOT MORE 
ABOUT THE NOTION OF DESPAIR 
ON THE 
OTHER SIDE OF THE AREA THERE IS A 
BEDROOM THAT HAS REMAINED UNTOUCHED 
FOR THREE YEARS IT REMAINS 
BELONGS TO DANNY MCCARTAN DANNY DANNY WAS A GREAT KID SIX F. T. TALL BIG 
CELTIC FAN AND LOVED MUSIC HE 
NEVER BROUGHT ANY TROUBLE TO OUR 
DOOR EVERYBODY LOVED DANNY DANNY DANNY WAS EIGHTEEN AND HAD A HISTORY OF 
DEPRESSION ON THE DAY HE DIED HE 
TOLD HIS PARENTS HE WAS FEELING 
REALLY BAD AND ASKED HIS 
PSYCHIATRIC NURSE IF HE COULD BE 
TAKEN INTO HOSPITAL THE FAMILY 
WERE TOLD THERE WERE NO BEDS AT AT NINE THIRTY P. M. WE GOT A KNOCK AT THE DOOR 
AND DANNY WAS FOUND DEAD ON ELEVENTH 
APRIL TWO THOUSAND FIVE YOU KNOW I KEEP SAYING 
WAS I TO STRICT ON DANNY WHY DID I 
NOT GO TO A COUPLE OF CELTIC 
MATCHES WITH HIM L. HAVE GUILT THE THE SUICIDE PROMPTED THE BIGGEST 
INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF YOUNG 
PEOPLE'S HEALTH SERVICES IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND AS A RESULT AN 
EIGHTEEN BED UNIT HAS BEEN SET UP TO HELP 
OF A YOUNG PEOPLE WHO NEED 
EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIC HELP 
I AM 
ASHAMED I AM PROUD TO HAVE HAD EIGHTEEN 
YEARS WITH DANNY 
IT HAS NEVER BEEN 
PROVED THE SUICIDES IN THE AREA 
WERE LINKED BUT WHAT IT DID SHOW 
IS THAT THERE WAS VERY BITOK 
UNDERSTANDING IN THE COMMUNITY 
ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH SUICIDE AND 
THOSE WHO WERE LEFT BEHIND VERY 
LITTLE UNDERSTANDING PHILIP SET UP 
A CHARITY CALLED PIPS TO PROVIDE A 
PLACE FOR PEOPLE CONSIDERING 
SUICIDE IT HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR 
FIVE YEARS 
WE HAVE LEARNED HOW TO 
APPROACH PEOPLE HOW TO APPROACH 
THE FAMILY WHO HAVE LOST A LOVED 
ONE WE HAVE LEARNED HOW TO 
APPROACH YOUNG PEOPLE AND ADULTS 
WHO HAVE BEEN IN SUCH DESPAIR THAT 
THEY HAVE BOUGHT ABOUT TAKING THEIR 
LIVES AND PROVIDING THEM WITH HELP 
AND SUPPORT THOUGHT ABOUT I I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT 
US AND THE WORK WE DO IF YOU 
WANTED TO MEET UP FOR A CUP OF TEA 
SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT SUPPORT IS BEST 
FOR YOU AND WHAT WE CAN 
REALISTICALLY OFFER 
THAT CALL WAS SOMEBODY WHO HAD 
ATTEMPTED TO TAKE HER OWN LIFE L. 
KNOW THAT PIPS HAS SAVED LIVES 
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE COME BACK AND 
THERE ARE CARDS ABOUT THEM PEOPLE 
SAY IF I HAD NOT HAD THE SUPPORT 
I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HERE TODAY 
THAT IS WHAT KEEPS YOU GOING 
COMING FROM NOT UNDERSTANDING THIS 
ISSUE IN TERMS OF MENTAL HEALTH 
WE HAVE LEARNED LOT OF 
INFORMATION WE CAN PASS THAT ON 
WHETHER IT BE TO PEOPLE IN ENGLAND 
WALES OR SCOTLAND AND WE ARE 
WILLING TO DO THAT BUT THERE ARE 
LESSONS TO BE LEARNT HERE AND WE 
ARE QUITE PREPARED TO SHARE THAT 
INFORMATION 
IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO ANYONE FOR 
INFORMATION AND SUPPORT YOU CAN 
CALL THE FREEPHONE NUMBER THAT IS 
UNTIL MIDNIGHT I'M JOINED BY THE 
REVEREND MARK THOMAS FROM BRIDGEND 
NATALIE LILLIS WHO HAS BEEN HELPED 
BY PIPS AND FATHER AIDAN TROY 
I WAS RELEASED REQUIRE SOMETHING IS 
SAID IT'S A PERMANENT SOLUTION TO 
A TEMPORARY PROBLEM HOW DO YOU GET 
THAT MESSAGE ACROSS TO YOUNG 
PEOPLE 
IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT PEOPLE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT I DON'T 
THINK ANY OF US CAN FULLY 
UNDERSTAND JUST HOW EXTREME THAT 
MOMENT MUST BE IN THE PIECE OF 
FILM A FATHER DESCRIBED AS VERY 
WELL DANNY HIMSELF SAID I WANT 
HELP HE DIDN'T GET IT AT THE TIME 
THERE IS ALWAYS A DANGER THERE 
COULD EVEN BE A CONNECTION WITH 
PLAYING SOME VIDEO GAMES YOU THINK 
I WILL COME BACK FROM THIS WHAT I 
WAS COMING ACROSS IN SAYING THAT 
WAS NOT TO BE SCARY THERE IS 
ENOUGH PAIN AROUND BUT TO SAY 
ONCE YOU DIE YOU DIED THE PROBLEM 
EVEN THOUGH IT IS THE MOST EXTREME 
YOU HAVE EVER MET CAN IN FACT 
WITH GOOD PEOPLE AROUND YOU FIND A 
SOLUTION TO THINK THAT BY TAKING 
MY LIFE I WILL SHOW MY LOVE FOR 
OTHERS I DON'T THINK IT IS A VERY 
GOOD MESSAGE 
NATALIE CONNOR YOU 
HAVE BEEN HELPED BY PIPS TELL ME 
HOW THEY HAVE 
HELPED YOU THEY THEY HELPED ME BECAUSE MY MUM TOOK HER 
OWN LIFE THREE YEARS AGO SHE WAS 
ONLY FORTY SIX YEARS OLD THOMI THAT WAS 
HEARTBREAKING I WENT THROUGH A 
STAGE OF DEPRESSION MYSELF L. TOOK 
AN OVERDOSE AT THE TIME L. THINK 
WAS JUST AFTER THAT I'D MET 
SOMEBODY FROM THE F. A T. A ELEVEN T. Y. THEY 
CAME TO MY HOME AND EXPLAINED 
PIPS THEY HAVE ACTUALLY SAVED MY 
LIFE I AM SO GRATEFUL L. WOULDN'T 
BE HERE TALKING TO YOU IF IT WASN'T 
FOR THE PIPS PROJECT STANDING BY ME 
THE THINGS I HAVE BEEN THROUGH UP 
UNTIL NOW 
YOU ARE ACTUALLY WORKING 
WITH PIPS NOW AREN'T YOU 
I AM A 
VOLUNTEER 
WHAT WOULD YOU GIVE VOLUNTEER WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE 
YOUNGSTERS WHO FEEL THEY ARE AT 
ROCK BOTTOM 
I HAVE FELT THAT L. 
WOULD SAY TO ANY YOUNG PERSON TALK 
TO YOUR DOCTOR IF NOT A FRIEND 
SOMEONE YOU ARE CLOSE TO 
EVERYTHING IS CONFIDENTIAL NOTHING 
IS GOING TO GO OUT OF THOSE DOORS 
IT IS JUST ALL KEPT THEIR L. WASN'T ASHAMED 
I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN TO ASHAMED NORTHERN IRELAND AND LOOKING AT 
SIMILAR PROJECTS TO THIS WHAT ARE 
YOU TRYING TO DO TO HELP YOUNG 
PEOPLE WHO ARE PERHAPS FEELING LIKE 
NATALIE WAS 
I THINK IT IS FINDING 
WAYS AND MECHANISMS THAT WE CAN 
BEGIN TO ENGAGE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE 
HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE 
ABOUT ENGAGING WITH US AS A CHURCH 
I REPRESENT THE CHURCH AND 
CHRISTIAN VOLUNTEERS WE JUST WANT 
TO BE ABLE TO LEARN FROM THE 
EXPERIENCE HENCE THE VISIT TO 
NORTHERN IRELAND ALSO TO BE ABLE 
TO DEVELOP WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN 
ENGAGE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE GET YOUNG 
PEOPLE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT 
ENGAGING WITH THIS THERE IS 
SOMETHING WE HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE TO 
THIS WHOLE THING 
I'M INTERESTED TO 
HEAR FROM YOU BECAUSE I KNOW YOU 
HAVE TAKEN A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO 
HOW FUNERALS ARE CONDUCTED WHAT 
DIFFERENCE ARE YOU MAKING 
I FOUND 
WITH A NUMBER OF FUNERALS I DID 
OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SIX OR 
SEVEN THERE WAS ALWAYS A DANGER IN 
A FUNERAL OF GLORIFICATION THAT 
THERE COULD BE AS NATALIE WAS 
SAYING SOMEBODY FEELING VERY LOW 
AND SAYING I WONDER IF THIS IS THE 
SOLUTION TALK ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES OF 
FAME AT LEAST I WILL GET IT ON 
THE OTHER HAND I WAS TRIED TO 
GRAPPLE WITH THE PROBLEM COMING 
FROM MY OWN TRADITIONAL THE 
CATHOLIC FAITH WHERE WE WOULD NOT 
VERY PEOPLE WHO HAD DIED BY SUICIDE 
ON CONSECRATED GROUND L. THINK WE 
HAVE TO BE VERY CONSCIOUS ABOUT NOT 
STIGMATISING THE FAMILY THE 
RELATIVES OR FRIENDS BUT EQUALLY 
DO NOT HOLD OUT TO CHURCH SAYING 
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS YOU 
CAN DO L. CAN TRUTHFULLY SAY THAT 
AS A SMALL CHILD I NEVER EVEN HEARD 
THE WORD SUICIDE NOW GENERATIONS 
ARE GROWING UP WE HAVE TO BE 
CAREFUL THAT WE DO NOT SAY THIS IS 
AN OPTION AMONG OTHER OPTIONS IS IS THAT SOMETHING YOU ARE LOOKING AT 
FUNERALS WHAT SORT OF THINGS ARE 
YOU LOOKING AT 
THE WORK THAT WE 
ARE INVOLVED WITH IN THE BRIDGEND 
AREA WE ARE TRYING TO ENGAGE YOUNG 
PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE NORMAL NINE TO 
FIVE HOURS THOSE ARE THE KIND OF 
THINGS WE ARE LOOKING AT WE HAVE 
BEEN IN A YOUTH CENTRE IN BRIDGEND 
AND IN A MINISTRY IT IS 
ESSENTIALLY ABOUT GOING INTO THE 
PLACES WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE AT 
THE ALLAH'S WHERE PERHAPS THEY ARE 
GATHERING WE TEND TO WORK BETWEEN 
TEN P. M. AND FOUR A M. IN THE TOWN CENTRES 
AND THE STREETS SIMPLY TRIED TO 
ENGAGE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE AND HAVE 
THEM FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT TALKING 
TO CHRISTIANS ABOUT SOME OF THE 
CHALLENGES THEY ARE FACING

TO TALK ABOUT THE RICH LIST WE WE DID START WITH THE RICH LIST IT 
GRAB YOUR ATTENTION DIDN'T YOU 
THE SUNDAY TIMES RICH LIST 
IT MUST 
BE GREAT BEING RICH BUT THIS IS 
LIKE GETTING YOUR A LEVEL RESULTS 
IT IS THE BEST DAY OF THE YEAR IF 
YOU ARE RICH L. BET YOU NORMALLY 
DON'T BUY IT BUT YOU GET SIX 
COPIES NOW WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW 
MUCH THEY HAVE GOT L. WOULD LIKE TO 
GET A SUNDAY TIMES PAUL E. S. T. THE 
ONE THOUSAND POOREST TWIN THEM UP LIKE 
TWIN TOWNS PAUL WELLER LIST 
THAT THEY WOULD GIVE MONEY TO THEM 
SHARE THE MONEY OUT LOOK AT THE 
OBSCENE AMOUNT OF WEALTH L. KNOW 
SOME OF THEM ARE FAIRLY 
PHILANTHROPIC BUT WOULD IT NOT BE 
NICE TO GET THESE LINKS UP THE 
ONE THOUSAND RICHEST PEOPLE THEY HAVE HAD 
THEIR MOMENT OF FAME LET'S PUT 
THEM WITH SOME POOR PEOPLE THAT 
WOULD BE EXCITING 
ALSO THE 
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY 
WE WERE 
DISCUSSING THAT THE ARCHBISHOP I 
DO FEEL FOR HIM IT SEEMS WHATEVER 
HE SAYS IS SEEMS TO BE BLOWN 
MASTER THE ART OF PROPORTION HE 
WAS ALLUDING TO THE MASSIVE 
DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE RICH 
CHANDERPAUL IT IS GROWING WE WERE 
DISCUSSING THE POTENTIAL WAYS OF 
BRIDGING THOSE GAPS ONE OF THEM 
WAS MASSIVELY TAXING THEM WE NEED 
TO FOCUS MORE ON HELPING PEOPLE AT 
THE LOW END OF THE SCALE THERE ARE 
LOTS OF WAYS OF DOING THAT MORE 
PEOPLE ARE GETTING INTO DEBT 
PEOPLE ARE GETTING RICHER THAT IS 
WHAT HE WAS ALLUDING TO BUT IN THE 
PAPER IT SAYS SALARIES OF THE RICH 
SHOULD BE CAPPED 
THAT IS NOT 
REALLY A PRACTICAL OPTION IS IT I I THINK WE COULD TAX THEM A BIT MORE 
THEN THEY WOULD LEAVE THE COUNTRY 
TRIP THEM UP ON THE WAY TO THE 
FERRY OR TAKE THEIR PASSPORTS OF 
THEM PAYING TAX SHOULD BE A JOY L. 
DON'T LIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY THEY 
DON'T LIKE IT WHY 
IT IS ONE OF WHY THE GREAT MARKS OF SYMBOLISE 
SOCIETY THAT WE PAY TAX IT IS LIKE 
THE WHEEL OR THE RENAISSANCE THE 
THREE MARKS OF SUPPLIES SOCIETY L. 
HAVE JUST MADE THAT UP 
WE CAN'T 
TAKE AWAY THE EIGHTH INCENTIVE FOR 
THE PRIVATE CENTRE 
I THINK IT IS AN IMPORTANT POINT 
ABOUT HELPING THOSE AT THE LOW END 
LOAN SHARKS ARE GETTING RICHER 
MORE PEOPLE ARE GETTING INTO DEBT 
THAT IS SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS TO LOOK AT SERIOUSLY L. THINK 
IAN MADE THE IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT 
THE PHILANTHROPY AND HOW IT IS A 
GROWING TREND 
IF HE WENT THROUGH 
THE RICH LIST THERE PROBABLY ARE 
SOME OF THEM ON THAT LIST 
A HUGE 
NUMBER I THINK THE NUMBER HAS GONE 
UP TO THE LEADING THIRTY 
PHILANTHROPISTS HAVE GIVEN BILLIONS 
TO CHARITABLE CAUSES 
SOMETIMES IT 
IS THE SEXY THINGS THAT GET THE 
MONEY SOMETIMES THE THINGS THAT 
ARE NOT VERY SEXY DO NOT GET IT 
THAT IS WHY I THINK TAXES A GOOD 
IDEA IDEA DIFFERENT SUPERMARKETS THAT PEOPLE 
ARE SHOPPING IN 
THE SO CALLED 
DISCOUNT SUPERMARKETS THAT IN THE 
FAST SOMEBODY LIKE MY SON WOULD 
NOT BE SEEN IN NOW HE WILL 
BECAUSE IT IS KIND OF TRENDY IN AN 
IRONIC WAY SO YOU GET THE MIDDLE 
CLASSES GOING OUT TO THESE 
SUPERMARKETS AND BUYING THEIR STUFF 
I THINK THAT IS GREAT THE WAY THE 
MIDDLE CLASSES ADOPT THINGS AND 
CALL IT THEIR OWN PERHAPS THEY 
WILL ADOPT BAD HOUSING AND BROWN 
TEETH AND SAY IT IS THEIR IDEA 
MAYBE THEY WILL HAVE TO CHANGE THE 
NAME 
VARIOUS SUPERMARKETS THAT NAME THEY MENTION ALSO THE PRODUCTS 
THEY SEEM TO BE BUYING DIFFERENT 
PRODUCTS AS WELL 
IT SEEMS THAT THE 
MYTH ABOUT SUPERMARKETS IS ABOUT 
BATTERED TINS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND 
IN SOME KINSHIPS THEY DO SELL MY 
STUFF IT IS THE SIXTH STIGMA OF 
CARRYING THE CARRIER BAGS AROUND 
TALKING ABOUT STIGMA WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT BEING SINS WHAT ARE 
THEY 
THIS IS A BUSYBODY STORY THE THEY IDEA THAT TRAFFIC WARDENS ARE 
SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST HATED 
PEOPLE IN BRITAIN BECAUSE THEY STOP 
YOU PARK YOUR CAR WHICH I DON'T 
AGREE WITH I LIKE TRAFFIC WARDENS 
THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO OUT 
AND IF YOU FILLED YOUR BEEN UP TO 
MUCH THEY WILL FIND YOU IF YOU 
PUT IT OUT ON THE WRONG DAY AS WELL 
I THINK THAT IS A GOOD IDEA SHOULD SHOULD THIS BE CONCERNING US THAT MUCH ON 
A SUNDAY MORNING 
WE HAD A 
DISAGREEMENT ABOUT TRAFFIC WARDENS 
I HAVE BEEN AT THE OTHER END OF IT 
I KNOW IN MY LOCAL COMMUNITY WE 
HAVE PROBLEMS IF THE DANES HAVE 
BEEN COLLECTED TWICE A WEEK THEY 
ARE OVERFLOWING L. THINK THE 
COUNCIL SHOULD ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM 
I ALSO WANT TO ASK YOU YOU WERE 
TALKING EARLIER ABOUT THE VICAR WHO 
WANTS TO SELL ALCOHOL AND THE 
CHURCH WHAT ARE MOSQUES DOING 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
IT IS 
INTERESTING IT IS AN INITIATIVE TO 
GET PEOPLE INVOLVED GET THE 
COMMUNITY INVOLVED IN THE CHURCH A 
LOT OF THE WORK WE DO IS AROUND 
MAKING TRYING TO GET MOSQUES 
INVOLVED IN THE COMMUNITY L. THINK 
RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS DO NEED TO 
UPDATE AND BECOME MORE ENGAGED WITH 
THE COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY WITH 
WOMEN AND YOUNG PEOPLE IF THAT IS 
A WAY TO DO THAT GREAT WITH 
MOSQUES WE HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNING 
TO SAY WE SHOULD HAVE WOMEN'S 
CENTRES AND PLACES FOR YOUNG 
PEOPLE A LOT OF THEM ARE DOING 
GREAT STUFF BUT NOT ENOUGH OF THEM 
WE HAVE FABULOUS BUILDINGS NOT 
BEING USED 
THANK YOU THOSE ARE THE VIEWS OF 
OUR GUESTS WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR 
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE ISSUES WE 
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING 
AS USUAL WE WILL BE LOOKING 
FORWARD TO THE HEARING YOUR 
COMMENTS IN THE MEANTIME 
LOVE AND MARRIAGE AT THE ALTAR AND 
CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN THE FAMILY 
WITH TWELVE CHILDREN SO FAR 
IT HAS 
GONE BEYOND OUR WILDEST DREAMS TO 
HAVE TWELVE WE REALLY DO HOPE THERE 
ARE MORE TO COME 
WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU 
IDEAS FOR THE PROGRAMME AS WELL 
YOU CAN SEND THEM TO OUR WEBSITE 
LOTS OF INFORMATION A COUPLE OF 
POINTS REMEMBER WE WERE TALKING 
ABOUT THE MAN PAYING TO TAKE HIS 
DAD TO THE PUB FRED SAYS MOST OF 
THE POGUES I WOULD LIKE TO MEET MY 
FRIENDS 
IN K. TWO TO YOUNG PEOPLE AM IN MY SEVENTIES AND FEEL EXCLUDED FROM MY 
COMMUNITY KATE AT YOUNG PEOPLE 
ANOTHER IT IS TERRIBLE THAT PEOPLE 
HAVE BAD NEIGHBOURS L. LEFT MY DOOR 
UP BY ACCIDENT AND BY NEIGHBOURS 
CHECK IF I WAS ALL RIGHT 
TONIGHT THOSE PHONE LINES WILL 
CLOSE AT MIDNIGHT 
A WHITE WEDDING IN A BEAUTIFUL 
CHURCH IS MANY BRIDE'S DREAM NOW 
THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IS PLANNING 
TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR COUPLES TO 
HAVE WEDDINGS IN THE CHURCH OF 
THEIR CHOICE NOT EVERYBODY IS 
HAPPY WITH THE A 
BEAUTIFUL CHURCH WEDDING IT WAS 
ALL SHE HAD DREAMED OF FOR HER IT 
WAS NEVER AN OPTION TO JOIN THE 
THOUSANDS OF OTHER COUPLES WHO GO 
TO THE LOCAL HOTEL CASTLE OR EVEN 
THE LONDON NIGHT TO GET MARRIED I I ALWAYS HAD THE IMAGE OF WALKING UP 
THE AISLE IN A BEAUTIFUL CHURCH L. 
WAS LUCKY TO HAVE THAT L. GIVE YOU 
THIS RAIN 
AS A SIGN OF OUR 
MARRIAGE 
AS A SIGN OF OUR MARRIAGE MARRIAGE USUALLY YOU CAN ONLY GET MARRIED IN 
A CHURCH WHERE YOU LIVE OR WORSHIP 
OTHER COUPLES HAVE TO WAIT FOR A 
DECISION FROM THE VICAR BEFORE THEY 
CAN ARRANGE THEIR BIG DAY 
THE PROCESS OF GETTING MARRIED IN A 
CHURCH FOR US WAS MADE VERY EASY 
WE LIVED HERE FOR OTHER COUPLES 
THE RED TAPE PROCESS THAT DOES 
APPLY IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES CAN PUT 
PEOPLE OFF IT IS A REAL SHAME NOW NOW THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IS PLANNING 
TO RELAX THE RULES GOVERNING WHICH 
PARISH COUPLES CAN TAKE THEIR BOWS 
IN FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY WILL BE 
ALLOWED TO GET MARRIED IN THE SAME 
PLACE AS THEIR PARENTS OR 
GRANDCHILDREN OR ANYWHERE THEY OR 
THEIR PARENTS HAVE LIVED FOR MORE 
THAN SIX MONTHS NOT EVERYONE IN 
THE CHURCH IS HAPPY 
IF PEOPLE GO TO THE CHURCH WHICH IS 
A LONG WAY AWAY FROM WHERE THEY 
LIVE TO GET MARRIED THERE WILL BE 
LESS CHANCE FOR THEM TO GET 
INVOLVED IN THAT CHART CHURCH AND 
LESS CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT 
DIFFERENCE GOD COULD MAKE IN THEIR 
MARRIAGE 
CHURCH WEDDINGS HAVE MARRIAGE DROPPED TO FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND PER YEAR DOWN BY 
HALF SINCE THE EIGHTIES WHILE CIVIL 
CEREMONIES HAVE DOUBLED TO NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
IN A DECADE 
WITH THE NEW LAWS WE 
GET LESS CHANCE TO TRY AND EXPLORE 
WITH PEOPLE WHAT DO THEY THINK 
MARRIAGE IS ALL ABOUT CLERGY ARE 
MEANT TO PRONOUNCE GOD'S BLESSING 
ON PEOPLE WHO MAY WELL NOT HAVE A 
VERY CHRISTIAN VIEW OF MARRIAGE IN 
THE OLD SYSTEM PEOPLE COULD GET 
MARRIED IN A LOCAL CHURCH BY 
WORSHIPPING FOR A CERTAIN LENGTH OF 
TIME IN THE NEW SYSTEM THEY WILL 
NOT HAVE TO DO THAT SO THERE WILL 
BE LESS INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO 
HAVE TO COME TO CHURCH 
THE NEW 
REELS RULES WILL MEAN MORE 
COUPLES CAN BOOK THE CHURCH THEY 
WANT BUT NOBODY KNOWS WHAT EFFECT 
IT WILL HAVE ON REGULAR CHURCH 
ATTENDANCE ATTENDANCE I'M JOINED BY BISHOP STEPHEN LOWE 
THE BISHOP OF HULME IN MANCHESTER 
THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE TO ASK IS 
YOU ARE ACTUALLY FOR THIS AREN'T 
YOU 
OF COURSE L. THINK IT IS TIME YOU WE DEALT WITH SOME ANTIQUATED RULES 
WHICH WE HAVE HAD IN PLACE FOR TOO 
LONG AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE REAL ATTACHMENTS TO THEIR 
LOCAL CHURCHES TO GET MARRIED IN 
THEM 
YOU USE THE WORD DETACHMENT THEM I WAS THINKING BECAUSE WE MOVED 
AROUND SO MUCH WHY CAN'T WE GET 
MARRIED ANYWHERE ATTACHMENTS 
EVERYBODY WOULD WANT TO GET MARRIED 
IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY OR CANTERBURY 
CATHEDRAL NEVER MIND THE VERY 
PRETTY FICKLE OF DIPPY PARISH 
CHURCH WHICH WOULD BE ANOTHER 
PROBLEM THE VICAR OF DEEPLY 
THAT IS WHY THESE RULES ARE MEANT 
TO ENABLE PEOPLE TO GO TO THE 
CHURCHES WHERE THEY HAVE SOME REAL 
CONNEXIONS IN THE PAST THAT HAS 
NOT QUITE BEEN POSSIBLE 
CONNEXIONS 
SHOULD PEOPLE HAVE A CONNEXIONS RELIGION IN ORDER TO BE MARRIED IN 
A CHURCH 
THEY HAD A CHOICE BY 
ASKING TO BE MARRIED IN A CHURCH 
THEY ARE MAKING A DECLARATION THEY 
WANT TO BE MARRIED IN THE EYES OF 
THE CHURCH AND COMMUNITY THAT IS 
THEIR CHOICE IT IS NOT UP TO THE 
CHURCH TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY 
SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE MARRIED IN 
CHURCH 
ARE THERE ANY COUNTRIES IN CHURCH THE WORLD WHICH YOU COULD USE AS A 
GOOD EXAMPLE 
I AM QUITE PROUD OF 
WHAT THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND DOES WE 
ARE INCLUSIVE WE BAPTISE MERRY 
AND BURY YOU WHATEVER FAITH YOU 
ARE OR NO FAITH AT ALL IF THAT IS 
WHAT YOU WANT FROM US THAT IS WHAT 
WE WILL OFFER 
HOW ABOUT PEOPLE WHO 
GET MARRIED DOING BUNGEE JUMPING 
ALL PEOPLE AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS 
SOME OF IT IS BIZARRE MANY OF THE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE FINDING THEY WANT TO 
GET MARRIED IN BARBADOS OR THAILAND 
OR ON BEACHES THEY COME HOME AND 
SAY THERE WAS SOMETHING MISSING 
FROM THE SERVICE THEY THEN GO TO 
THE LOCAL PARISH CHURCH AND SAY 
COULD WE HAVE A BLESSING IN THE 
CHURCH BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T FELT 
PROPERLY MARRIED IN THE CEREMONY ON 
THE BEACH FINE O. K. WE CAN OFFER 
THAT AS WELL 
HOW ABOUT PICTURESQUE 
CHURCHES WILL THEY BENEFIT FROM 
THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WILL GO THERE 
IN THE SENSE IT IS THE LINKAGE 
THAT IS STILL IMPORTANT IT ISN'T 
THE FREE FOR ALL PEOPLE HAVE TO 
PROVE THAT LINKAGE CAN SAY WE HAVE 
SOME REAL CONNECTION WITH THIS 
CHURCH THOSE CHURCHES WHICH MAY BE 
A BIT MORE POPULAR WILL I HOPE 
BENEFIT BECAUSE MOST ARE AGREED 
ONE LISTED AND HAVE MAINTENANCE AND 
CARE ISSUES GRADE ONE LISTED IT IT IS INTERESTING THANK YOU
