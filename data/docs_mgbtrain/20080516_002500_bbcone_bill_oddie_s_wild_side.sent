NEVER MIND WE'RE GONNA GO OUT WITH A BANG 
OH MY GOD SOMEBODY'S SHOT HIM 
CHRIS AND JOHN GET THEIR FINAL CHALLENGES 
VO VO VO VOOM 
WE'LL BE SHOWING YOU A FEW OF THE THINGS 
THAT DIDN'T QUITE GO TO PLAN 
WHAT I'VE TRIED TO DO IN THIS SERIES 
IS SHOW YOU SOME OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS 
THAT WE HUMANS ARE INVOLVED WITH THE NATURAL WORLD 
IN OTHER WORDS THERE'S NOT ONLY SOME SPECIAL WILDLIFE 
THERE'S ALSO SOME VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE 
IN THE FIRST SHOW I CHALLENGED CHRIS WATSON TO REVEAL AND RECORD 
THE SOUNDS OF SILENCE 
MEANING THE WILDLIFE THAT WE MAY NOT HAVE REALISED MAKES ANY SOUND AT ALL 
OOH 
OF COURSE TO DO THIS CHRIS HAD TO EMPLOY 
SOME HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY 
DOCTOR WHO MIGHT HAVE A SONIC SCREWDRIVER 
BUT THIS IS A SONIC COAT HANGER 
WELL I'VE GOT ONE FINAL REQUEST WHICH IS GONNA INVOLVE 
NOT ONLY VISITING ONE OF MY AND I SUSPECT YOUR FAVOURITE BIRDS 
BUT ALSO ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PLACES THE FABULOUS FARNE ISLANDS 
A SEABIRD ISLAND A RIOT OF WONDERFUL SIGHTS 
AND IN SOME WAYS EVEN MORE WONDERFUL SOUNDS 
THERE'S A SCREECHING OF SANDWICH TERN 
I CAN HEAR A KITTIWAKE SOMEWHERE GULLS IN THE DISTANCE 
THE ODD SONG OF THE SEAL WAFTING ACROSS 
AND YET HERE'S A BIT OF AN IRONY 
I THINK THE ONE BIRD MOST PEOPLE COME TO A SEABIRD COLONY TO SEE 
IS THIS ONE 
THE PUFFIN UNDOUBTEDLY THE VISUAL STARS 
BUT I CAN HONESTLY SAY 
I'M NOT SURE I'VE EVER HEARD A PUFFIN MAKE A NOISE 
OYSTER CATCHER YES LISTEN TO THAT BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP 
PUFFIN ABSOLUTELY SILENT DOESN'T EVEN SAY 
SHUT UP OYSTER CATCHER GO AWAY FILM CREW 
SO DO PUFFINS PRODUCE SOUND 
WELL ONE THING'S FOR CERTAIN IF THEY DO 
CHRIS WATSON WILL BE RECORDING 'EM SO ALL I'VE GOTTA DO IS FIND HIM 
AMONGST CHRIS'S MANY TALENTS HE IS OF COURSE AN ABSOLUTE MAESTRO 
WHEN IT COMES TO SEABIRD SURVEILLANCE 
MIND YOU IN THIS CASE IT ISN'T EXACTLY A HIDDEN MIC 
HE'S JUST PLONKED IT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF A PUFFIN COLONY 
IF EVER THERE WAS A BIRD THAT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT SHOULD BE NOISY 
IT'S A PUFFIN ISN'T IT COS THEY'VE GOT PARROT LIKE BEAKS 
PEOPLE CALL THEM SEA PARROTS AND THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE 
TALKING TO EACH OTHER 
AND THEIR WINGS LOOK AS THOUGH THEY OUGHT TO MAKE A SORT OF 
MOTORBIKE NOISE AS THEY COME IN AND YET 
AND I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA CONTRADICT ME 
THEY ARE VIRTUALLY SILENT BUT THEY'RE NOT ARE THEY 
NO THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE REALLY REALLY VERY VOCAL BIRDS 
BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT I'VE SEEN ONE HUNDRED PUFFINS GATHERED TOGETHER 
ALL LOOKING AS THOUGH THEY SHOULD BE GABBLING AWAY 
AND YET I'M LISTENING I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING 
WELL YOU NEED TO GET THE MICS IN CLOSE NOW HAVE A LISTEN 
THIS NOW THIS IS THAT MIC DOWN THERE 
OH MY GOODNESS 
WELL I WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE WINGS 
THE WING SOUND'S REALLY POWERFUL THAT'S SOMETHING I DIDN'T EXPECT 
WHOA 
THIS IS LIKE LISTENING TO WHAT IS IT T. T. MOTORBIKES 
OH YEAH 
VO VO VO VOOM 
BUT IN FILMS OFTEN PEOPLE SORT OF FABRICATE SOUNDS 
TO GO WITH PARTICULARLY WING SOUNDS OF BIRDS IN FLIGHT 
IT'S THE OLD WET FLANNEL JOB ISN'T IT LIKE THIS 
WHEREAS NOW WE'VE GOT THE REAL THING 
WHICH IS BETTER 
UM LET ME THINK 
IT'S PERFECT THIS 
BEING ABLE TO LISTEN CLOSELY BUT OBSERVE FROM A DISTANCE 
IT IS ISN'T IT 
THAT'S THAT'S 
SORRY YOU JUST CAN'T HELP BUT SMILE WHEN YOU HEAR THAT 
TOTALLY IT'S LIKE E. T. OR SOMETHING AHH PHONE HOME 
AND THEY DON'T OPEN THEIR BEAKS 
I'VE NOT SEEN THEM DO IT NO 
ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT A LOT OF THESE BIRDS WHEN THEY COME IN 
HAVE A BEAK FULL OF SAND EELS YEAH 
AND IF THEY WERE TO OPEN THEIR BEAK TO MAKE ANY NOISE 
THEY'D LOSE 'EM ALL 
I JUST WANT IT TO DO A TAP DANCE NOW GET A BIT OF RHYTHM GOING 
IT LIKES IT THOUGH LOOK AT THAT IT'S NICE AND COSY ON MY TOES 
WHOA HE'S JUMPED OFF 
OH THAT'S PERFECT THEY'RE DISCUSSING YOUR MICROPHONE NOW 
I THINK THAT'S COMING FROM UNDERGROUND THAT LONG 
ROLLING CALL IS BEING MADE BY ADULTS DOWN IN THE BURROWS 
BECAUSE UNDERNEATH UNDER THE SURFACE OF THIS COLONY IS JUST 
A HONEYCOMB OF TUNNELS AND BURROWS 
SO THIS SOUND PERCOLATES UP THROUGH THE GROUND 
OF COURSE ACTUALLY RECORDING UNDERGROUND 
IS GONNA REQUIRE A VERY SPECIALISED PIECE OF EQUIPMENT 
WOULD I BE RIGHT IN ASSUMING THAT THIS TECHNIQUE 
WILL INVOLVE A WIRE COAT HANGER 
FUNNY YOU SHOULD SAY THAT 
FROM MY LUXURY ONE STAR HOTEL ROOM THIS MORNING 
NOW WE'VE NOT ONLY GOT A TINY MIC DOWN THERE WE'VE ALSO GOT 
SOMETHING I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE A PUFFIN CHICK IN ITS BURROW 
I LOVE THIS BIT WE'LL PUT THE HEADPHONES ON AND FADE UP 
COS YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'LL HEAR 
NOTHING 
THERE'S A BIRD CROSSING WITH SAND EELS 
IS THAT IT JUST RUN ACROSS IT'S DISAPPEARED 
THIS COULD BE GOING UNDERGROUND 
OH THERE CHICK 
LET'S FACE IT THAT'S YOUR STANDARD CHICK 
I'M HUNGRY NOISE ISN'T IT 
YEAH INSISTENT 
WHAT THE DICKENS WAS THAT A SQUEAL 
THAT'S A PUFFIN CHICK IT'S A REAL SORT OF WAIL YEAH 
INCREDIBLE THAT WAS A SCREAM 
THAT SCARED THE LIFE OUT OF ME 
HA THAT'S GREAT 
AH WELL THAT'S PUFFINS FOR YA 
NOT ONLY LOOK GOOD THEY SOUND GOOD 
IF YOU CAN HEAR THEM 
THANKS CHRIS A PLEASURE 
AND THE PUFFINS AGREE THAT'S PUFFIN LANGUAGE FOR 
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE CHRIS 
SO IF CHRIS IS MY EARS IN THIS SERIES THEN MY EYES COME COURTESY 
OF CAMERAMAN JOHN AITCHISON 
WOAR 
OVER THE WEEKS I'VE SET JOHN SOME PRETTY TRICKY CHALLENGES 
AND HE'S RISEN TO THE OCCASION ON UM WELL MOST OF THEM 
SO FOR JOHN'S SWANSONG NOT A SWAN 
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE EASIEST THING TO FILM 
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE HARDEST 
THE HARDEST ANIMAL MM 
NOW THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT PROBABLY THE FOX BADGER FOX 
THE RED KITE 
PROBABLY THE OTTER PROBABLY BE A BIRD 
THE WILD CAT IN SCOTLAND 
EAGLES DORMOUSE 
O. K. YEAH THANKS FOR THAT BUT WHAT DOES JOHN HAVE TO SAY 
BIRDS OF PREY ARE PROBABLY THE HARDEST 
GOSH IT'S DIFFICULT ISN'T IT 
IT'S THERE IT'S EASY GO ON GET IT 
CAN'T SEE IT AT THE MOMENT 
OH GONE 
REALLY HARD NOW IT'S VERY QUICK 
YOU CAN FIND IT IN THE WIDE AND THEN CRASH IN VERY QUICKLY 
GO ON HAVE A GO 
LET ME WITNESS YOU CRASHING 
YEAH BIRDS ARE DIFFICULT JOHN I ACCEPT ALL THAT 
BUT LET'S FACE IT BIRDS AREN'T THE ONLY THING THAT FLY RIGHT 
WHAT I'M GONNA SUGGEST IS DRAGONFLIES O. K. 
THAT'S DIFFICULT THEY'RE VERY FAST 
OF COURSE IT'S DIFFICULT THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT 
RIGHTY O. THEN SO THIS WEEK'S CAMERAMAN CHALLENGE 
IS TO CAPTURE DRAGONFLIES IN FLIGHT YEAH 
OF COURSE FIRST SECRET OF BEING AN ACE CAMERAMAN 
BE AT THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME 
SO HERE I AM MIDDLE OF THE DAY AND A GREAT PLACE 
LOADS OF WATER 
SUNNY DAY AS WELL WHICH SHOULD BE GOOD FOR DRAGONFLIES 
SO LET'S SEE WHAT'S HERE 
IF YOU LIKE TO GAMBLE I TELL YOU I'M YOUR MAN 
YOU WIN SOME LOSE SOME IT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME 
THEY CHANGE DIRECTION SO QUICKLY 
IF THEY DECIDE THEY WANT TO GO THAT WAY THEY GO WHOOM 
AND I CAN'T DO THAT WITH THIS COS THIS HAS SOME DRAG ON IT 
SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO SLACKEN IT RIGHT OFF SO I CAN 
BE AS FLEXIBLE AS A DRAGONFLY 
THEY'RE SO MUCH QUICKER THAN ME 
IT'S JUST HOPELESS I HAVEN'T GOT REACTION TIMES LIKE A DRAGONFLY 
I THINK A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT IS CALLED FOR DON'T YOU 
COME ON JOHN COME ON JOHN 
COME ON JOHN 
YOU CAN DO IT JOHN 
I'VE GOTTA FIND ANOTHER WAY TO REALLY GET TO GRIPS WITH THEM FLYING 
AND I'M SURE YOU WILL YOU JUST NEED TIME 
I'M GONNA LEAVE JOHN TO IT AND 
I'LL BE HONEST ALL THAT SPINNING'S MADE ME FEEL A BIT SICK 
SO HOW ABOUT LOOKING FOR A CURE IN NATURE'S OWN MEDICINE CABINET 
A RIOT OF WILD FLOWERS IN BLOOM ARE VERY VERY PRETTY 
AND HOW VERY VERY USEFUL 
I'M SURE THERE REALLY CAN'T BE ANYONE WHO ISN'T AWARE OF 
SO CALLED HERBAL MEDICINES NATURAL REMEDIES 
MOST OF US TAKE THEM DON'T WE 
INFUSIONS TEAS TINCTURES POTIONS AND PILLS 
ALL PRODUCED FROM NATURALLY GROWN PLANTS AND FLOWERS 
NOW SOMETIMES HERBAL MEDICINES ARE REFERRED TO AS NEW AGE 
BUT THE TRUTH IS IN FACT THEY'RE VERY VERY OLD AGE 
INDEED THERE ISN'T A CIVILISATION ON EARTH 
THAT DIDN'T HAVE FAITH IN THEM AND RELY ON THEM 
COS FRANKLY THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE 
BUT HOW ON EARTH DID THEY DECIDE WHAT WOULD CURE WHAT AILMENT 
I MEAN IT CAN ONLY HAVE BEEN TRIAL AND ERROR 
TRIAL AND ERROR 
HOW MANY DID THEY TRY 
AND HOW SERIOUS WERE THE ERRORS 
OH OH OH I HAVE GOT SUCH A HEADACHE 
NEVER MIND CHANCES ARE THAT GROWING OUT HERE SOMEWHERE 
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WILL CURE IT 
SO JUST GIVE ME AN HOUR OR TWO AND I'LL EAT ME WAY THROUGH THIS LOT 
OH MY HEADACHE'S COMPLETELY GONE BUT I HAVE GOT CRAMPS SHIVERS 
AND SQUITS AND UH UH I THINK I'VE POISONED MYSELF 
WHAT A ROTTEN JOB EH OH YES I'M A TESTER FOR A HERBALIST 
POISONING YOUR PATIENTS ISN'T TERRIBLY GOOD FOR A DOCTOR'S BUSINESS 
AND BELIEVE ME BEING A HERBALIST OR AN APOTHECARY 
WAS VERY BIG BUSINESS 
WHAT DOCTORS REALLY NEEDED IN ORDER TO FLOG THEIR POTIONS 
WAS AN IRREFUTABLE ARGUMENT AS TO WHY CERTAIN FLOWERS 
WOULD CURE CERTAIN DISEASES 
AND THUS WAS CONCEIVED THE DOCTRINE OF SIGNATURES 
IF A CERTAIN PART OF A FLOWER OR PLANT RESEMBLETH A PARTICULAR ORGAN 
OR ASPECT OF THE HUMAN BODY 
THEN THIS IS A SIGN OR SIGNATURE FROM THE CREATOR THAT IS GOD 
THAT THIS FLOWER WILL CURE ANY AILMENT 
OF THE PARTICULAR PART PORTRAYED 
GET IT I MEAN WHAT A PIECE OF MARKETING GENIUS IMAGINE THE SCENE 
BLOKE GOES INTO THE DOCTOR HE SAYS 
DOCTOR I'VE GOT A TERRIBLE NOSE BLEED 
DO YOU REALLY THAT'S TERRIBLE WELL I SUGGEST THAT YOU 
TAKE A BUNCH OF THESE FLOWERS WITH WATER EVERY DAY YES 
UM WILL THEY WORK OF COURSE IT WILL YES 
GOD HAS GIVEN US A SIGN 
OH YEAH WHAT'S THAT THEN 
WELL THEY'RE RED AREN'T THEY AND WHAT COLOUR IS BLOOD 
RED EXACTLY IT'S RED SO RED FLOWERS 
WILL CURE ANYTHING LIKE A BLOODY NOSE OR WOUNDS OR SCARLET FEVER 
GLIB YOU DARE TO CALL THE WORD OF GOD GLIB 
NO NO OH I'M REALLY REALLY SORRY I'LL TAKE HALF A DOZEN 
NO I WON'T I'LL TAKE TEN I'LL TAKE FIFTY 
ALL RIGHT AND HERE'S A BIT EXTRA ON THE SIDE 
AND DON'T TELL THE VICAR WILL YOU 
I'M SORRY GOD I'M REALLY SORRY 
THE TRUTH IS THERE WERE MANY SEEMINGLY AUTHORITATIVE 
SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURY MEDICAL TOMES 
THAT WERE BASED ENTIRELY ON THE DOCTRINE OF SIGNATURES 
NIPPLEWORT FOR EASING SORE NIPPLES 
YELLOW FLOWERS WILL CURE YELLOW JAUNDICE 
AND THIS ONE HAS TO BE MY FAVOURITE 
THE LESSER CELANDINE 
ONE HERBALIST THOUGHT IT MUST BE UNIQUE 
SO HE SCRABBLED AROUND PULLED IT OUT 
LOOKED AT THE ROOTS AND THERE WERE THESE FUNNY LITTLE NOBBLES ON THEM 
AND FROM THEN ON IT WAS CALLED PILEWORT 
THESE DAYS THE DOCTRINE OF SIGNATURES 
BUT OF COURSE HERBAL MEDICINE IS STILL GOING STRONG 
AND ONE THING IS FOR SURE WHATEVER THE AILMENT 
THERE IS ALMOST CERTAINLY A CURE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE 
ACTUALLY JUST BEING OUT IN THE GARDEN ALWAYS MAKES ME FEEL GOOD 
ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M WATCHING THE WILDLIFE OR EVEN BETTER 
FILMING THE WILDLIFE 
WHICH IS WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING ALL THROUGH THIS YEAR 
AND THERE'S BEEN AN AWFUL LOT GOING ON 
MYSTERIES NEW LIFE 
DEATHS ALL SORTS OF DELIGHTS 
SO I THOUGHT FOR THE FINAL SHOW WE SHOULD SINGLE OUT 
SOME OF THE MOST MEMORABLE MOMENTS AND HAVE OUR OWN AWARD CEREMONY 
IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN AN EXTREMELY PRODUCTIVE YEAR 
IN THE GARDEN FOR BIRDS 
AND IT'S BEEN VERY HARD TO CHOOSE THE WINNERS 
BUT THE AWARD FOR THE MOST INDUSTRIOUS PARENTS HAS TO GO TO 
THE ROBINS 
AND THEY ALSO PROVIDED US WITH THE MOST PHOTOGENIC OFFSPRING 
THE RATS CERTAINLY DESERVE A MENTION FOR COMPLETELY IGNORING 
EVERY BIZARRE OBJECT I PUT IN FRONT OF THEIR HOME 
TO TRY AND PERSUADE THEM TO LEAVE 
SO THEY'RE OUR WORTHY WINNERS OF 
THE I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S WHAT'S IT AWARD 
OH AND THEY ALSO PRODUCED SOME VERY CUTE BABIES 
AND NOW THE AWARD FOR THE MOST CHILLED OUT CREATURE 
WHICH HAS TO GO TO THE GREAT TITS 
FOR SOAKING UP THE SUNSHINE LETTING IT ALL HANG OUT 
AND GENERALLY STAYING COOL 
THE AWARD FOR THE GREEDIEST BIRD WAS GOING TO GO TO THE JAY 
BUT THEN ALONG CAME A LATE ENTRANT MRS. BLACKBIRD 
GOOD GRIEF UNDOUBTEDLY THE WINNER OF THE MINDLESS GLUTTONY AWARD 
AND WHILST WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT OF UNSOPHISTICATED DINING HABITS 
THE WINNERS OF THE 
MOST STUBBORN PIG HEADED NOTHING'S GONNA STOP US GETTING AT OUR PEANUTS 
AWARD GOES TO OF COURSE THE GREY SQUIRREL 
THERE WERE MANY OTHER GARDEN VISITORS 
THAT POPPED IN AND POPPED OUT AGAIN WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING 
PARTICULARLY SPECIAL OTHER THAN LOOKING NICE ON CAMERA 
WELL YOU'RE ALL VERY VERY WELCOME BUT HERE'S A TIP 
IF YOU DO WANT TO ACTUALLY 
DO SOMETHING 
WHICH BRINGS US TO THE TOP AWARD 
THE OVERALL PRIZE FOR THE MOST ENTERTAINING INGENIOUS 
AND ARGUABLY THE MOST PHOTOGENIC CREATURE IN MY LITTLE GARDEN 
AND IT GOES TO 
FOXY 
AND JUST TO SHOW YOU HOW MUCH OF A SHOWMAN HE IS HE'S PROVIDING HIS 
OWN FINALE BY MAKING AN ATTEMPT ON THE WORLD SCRATCHING RECORD 
YOU GO FOR IT BOY 
IN FACT FOXY WENT ON SCRATCHING FOR AT LEAST TEN MINUTES 
WHICH WAS EASY TO FILM 
BUT RATHER LESS FASCINATING TO WATCH WHICH OF COURSE TAKES US BACK 
TO JOHN AITCHISON 
WE LEFT JOHN ATTEMPTING TO FILM DRAGONFLIES IN FLIGHT 
FASCINATING TO WATCH BUT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FILM 
THEY'RE SO MUCH QUICKER THAN I AM 
THEY'RE MUCH QUICKER THAN EVERYBODY 
OH THIS IS GOOD 
JUST DOWN HERE THERE'S A DARTER 
THAT'S QUITE A SMALL DRAGONFLY VERY BEAUTIFUL 
BUT WHAT I'VE NOTICED IS IT'S USING THE SAME PERCH 
SO HOPEFULLY IF I JUST KEEP IT FRAMED LIKE THIS 
IT'LL FLY AWAY THERE IT GOES 
AND THEN INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING IT I'LL ANTICIPATE IT 
THERE WE ARE STRAIGHT BACK TO THE SAME PLACE 
I'M NOT SURE BILL WILL COUNT THAT AS A FLIGHT SHOT 
ALTHOUGH IT WAS FLYING WASN'T IT 
OH WOW LOOK AT THAT BEAUTIFUL COLOURS 
THESE ARE EMPEROR DRAGONFLIES AND THAT'S THE MALE 
THEY'RE MATING THAT'S THE MALE 
WITH THE BLUE COLOUR ON HIS ABDOMEN AND THE FEMALE'S THE GREENER ONE 
I THINK THEY'RE THE BIGGEST IN BRITAIN THEY REALLY ARE SPECTACULAR 
AND LOOK AT THE SIZE OF ITS EYES 
THEY'RE THE BIGGEST EYES OF ANY INSECT WHICH OF COURSE HELPS 
THEM FIND PREY AND IT ALSO HELPS THEM TO SEE EACH OTHER 
WHEN THEY'RE PATROLLING THESE PONDS ROUND HERE 
AND ITS WINGS BEAUTIFUL 
LIKE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS WITHOUT THE COLOUR 
I DON'T THINK THE MATING DRAGONFLIES COUNT AS FLIGHT SHOTS DO THEY BILL 
WELL NO BUT THEY'RE GREAT 
SO BACK TO THE FLYING 
I HAVEN'T GOT WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR YET BUT SOME OF THESE DARTERS 
THESE RED BODIED DARTERS OUT HERE ARE MATING AS WELL 
AND THEY'RE TRYING TO LAY EGGS TOO 
BUT BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT EIGHT WINGS IT MIGHT SLOW THEM DOWN A BIT 
AND THEY HAVE TO STAY TOGETHER WHILE THEY'RE DOING IT 
THE MALE'S AT THE FRONT AND THE FEMALE'S 
TOUCHING THE WATER WITH HER BODY DROPPING EGGS INTO IT 
O. K. I'M GONNA TRY ONE LAST THING WHAT I CAN DO WITH THIS CAMERA 
IT'S ALMOST A SECRET WEAPON REALLY IT CAN SHOOT SLOW MOTION 
SO IF I PRESS THE BUTTON ON HERE 
IT'LL SLOW THE PICTURES DOWN TWO AND A HALF TIMES 
WHICH AT LEAST MAKES THE SHOTS A BIT LONGER 
I THINK THAT PROBABLY COUNTS DOESN'T IT BILL 
ABSOLUTELY FINE WHATEVER WORKS 
YES THIS IS GOOD 
WELL THAT'S SORT OF WORKING 
SO THAT'S THEM SLOWED RIGHT DOWN 
WOW THEY'RE JUST AMAZING THEY FLY SO WELL 
I'M FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR DRAGONFLIES 
HAVING WATCHED THEM CAREFULLY HOW THEY'RE FLYING 
IT'S BEEN A FANTASTIC CHALLENGE 
BUT PROBABLY THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVER HAD TO FILM 
JOHN SAID IN AN EARLIER PROGRAMME THAT ONE OF THE THINGS 
HE TRIED TO DO IS FIND THE ART IN NATURE 
THE ART THE SCIENCE THE MUSIC THE FUN ALL THOSE THINGS 
THAT ENRICH OUR LIFE THAT WE GET FROM WILDLIFE 
THAT'S WHAT THIS SERIES HAS BEEN ABOUT 
IT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN EASY 
ANIMALS SIMPLY DON'T STICK TO THE SCRIPT 
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU FOLKS THESE ARE TERRIBLY GOOD GARDENING GLOVES 
BUT THEY'RE NOT ENTIRELY VOLE PROOF 
AND LET'S FACE IT NEITHER DOES THE PRESENTER 
NO GO AGAIN 
YOU AIN'T SEEN ME RIGHT 
THAT'S MORE OR LESS THE END OF THIS REEL 
WHICH IT ISN'T 
IT'S GOING PRETTY WELL I THINK 
OINK OINK 
ALL RIGHT 
I HAVE TO ACCEPT SOME OF MY FACULTIES ARE NOT WHAT THEY WERE 
I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING CAN YOU HEAR THAT NO AH 
CHRIS WATSON IS AT THIS VERY MOMENT RISKING LIFE AND LIMB 
TO SET UP MICROPHONES SO HE CAN RECORD A PARTICULARLY TALENTED OAK 
OH MY GOD SOMEBODY'S SHOT HIM 
BUT CHRIS RECOVERED TO BRING US A T. V. FIRST 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 
THE SOUND OF WASPS CHOMPING 
MAKING PAPER FOR THE NEST 
YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST 
AND JOHN HAD A FIRST TOO 
OH YES 
AND ALL THREE SPECIES UNDER ONE TIN 
AMAZING OH AMAZING LOOK AT THAT 
AND AS ALWAYS WITH WILDLIFE THERE WAS THE THRILL 
OF THE TOTALLY UNEXPECTED 
BLIMEY WELL I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE 
WHAT THE DICKENS ARE THEY FIGHTING ABOUT 
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY BASICALLY TRYING TO DROWN ONE ANOTHER 
KITTIWAKES ARE ALWAYS REGARDED AS ONE OF THE CALMEST SWEETEST 
MOST HARMLESS LITTLE BIRDS 
THE SORT OF DOVES OF THE GULL WORLD LOOK AT THESE TWO THOUGH WHOO 
AND THERE WAS NOT ONLY GRATUITOUS VIOLENCE 
THERE WAS ALSO GRATUITOUS CUTENESS 
YOU ARE HERE 
SO AM I 
MAYBE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE PASS BY 
BUT THEY ALL DISAPPEAR FROM VIEW 
AND I 
ONLY HAVE EYES 
FOR YOU 
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO USE FIELD CRAFT 
YOU HAVE TO BE SUBTLE AND STEALTHY 
OTHERWISE BIRDS WILL JUST MELD INTO THE FOREST 
ACTUALLY WOULD YOU BELIEVE GOLDEN PHEASANTS 
CAN BE REALLY HARD TO SEE 
WELL NOT THIS ONE 
A GLISTENING JEWEL OF THE ORIENT IN AN ENGLISH WOODLAND 
OR A CHINESE TAKEAWAY TO MR. FOX 
I LIKE THE IDEA WITH THESE FOXES 
THAT BECAUSE WE'RE MORE OR LESS IN BASILDON 
THAT MAYBE THEY'RE BASILDON BRUSH 
THAT'S TERRIBLE ISN'T IT 
JOHN YOU STICK TO THE CAMERAWORK 
I'LL DO THE NAFF JOKES 
THEY ARE UM 
RATHER EN DEER ING 
I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I GOT SO FAR 
OH DEER DEER OH I'VE DONE IT AGAIN 
AND I'LL DO THE COMEDY FALLS 
SO THAT'S IT FOR THIS SERIES OF WILD SIDE 
IS IT GOODBYE OR IS IT AU REVOIR 
A BIENTOT SAYONARA 
BIS DANN 
WHEN WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN 
WHEN WILL WE SHARE PRECIOUS MOMENTS 
WILL I HAVE TO WAIT FOR EVER 
WILL I HAVE TO SUFFER 
AND CRY THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH 
WHEN WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN 
WHEN WILL OUR HEARTS BE TOGETHER 
ARE WE IN LOVE 
OR JUST FRIENDS 
IS THIS MY BEGINNING 
OR IS THIS THE END 
WHEN WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN 
GOOD LUCK MATE
