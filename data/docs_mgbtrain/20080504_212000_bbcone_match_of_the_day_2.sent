LEAGUE FOOTBALL WITH HIGHLIGHTS OF 
TODAY'S TWO GAMES AND ALL THE 
WEEKEND'S GOALS LEE DIXON IS MY 
LONE SIDEKICK TONIGHT SO WE ARE 
EFFECTIVELY THE MATCH OF THE DAY TWO 
ARSENAL V. S. EVERTON ARSENAL HAVE 
HAD A FEW WEEKS TO GET USED TO THE 
IDEA OF MISSING OUT ON PROPER GLORY 
BUT EVERTON STILL HAD SOME PRIZE TO 
PLAY FOR 
THE RACE FOR THIRD PLACE IN 
EUROPEAN FOOTBALL HAS BEEN HOTTING 
UP ALL THE TIME BETWEEN EVERTON AND 
ASTON VILLA LAST WEEK THEY COULD 
NOT BE SEPARATED AND DAVID MOYES'S 
TEAM ARE NOW THREE GAMES WITHOUT A 
WIN THE TOFFEES ARE BACK IN THE 
DRIVING SEAT ARSENAL HAVE FOUND 
THEMSELVES BY MIXING DERBY ON 
MONDAY ARSENAL'S NEW AIM IS TO REACH EIGHTY THREE 
POINTS EVERTON REQUIRE A DRAW TO 
CONFIRM UEFA CUP FOOTBALL BOTH 
SIDES WILL REFLECT ON HOW CLOSE 
THEY CAME TO ACHIEVING EATING 
EVEN GREATER GOALS ARSENE MAKES TWO CHANGES JUST ONE CHANGE FOR EVERTON TONY 
HIBBERT AND GOES INTO DEFENCE TO 
RELEASE NEVILLE INTO MIDFIELD AS 
GOALSCORING GOES EVEN CRISTIANO 
RONALDO'S MAGNIFICENT FORTY GOALS IS 
DWARFED BY A DIXIE DEAN WHO SCORED 
A HAT TRICK AGAINST ARSENAL SIXTY DAYS 
AGO SIXTY YEARS AGO THIS WEEK HIS 
GRANDCHILDREN COME OUT TO MARK THE 
PHENOMENAL ACHIEVEMENT IT'S A GOOD EFFORT THE FIRST REAL SIGHT OF GOAL THEO WALCOTT ON CURRENT FORM 
INEVITABLY INVOLVED HE JUST PULLED 
HIS ARMS AWAY AT THE END BECAUSE 
HE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO GO WIDE 
A MAN AND ADEBAYOR TRYING A DEFT 
LITTLE TOUCH DENILSON NICKLAS 
BENDTNER GILBERT SO'S HEADER WAS OFF TARGET 
IT WAS A DECENT BALL IN AND THE 
GILBERTO SILVA RIDES BUT COULD NOT 
HAVE DIRECT A HEADER ON TARGET GILL BURKE A COLLISION BETWEEN PHIL NEVILLE 
AND WILLIAM GALLAS NO APPEALS FOR 
A PENALTY THERE WAS A MURMUR OF 
EXCITEMENT ON THE TERRACES THE INTENSE WAS DEFINITELY NOT 
THERE A TRIO OF TALENT CESC 
FABREGAS IN THE MIDDLE CELEBRATING 
HIS TWENTY FIRST BIRTHDAY TODAY HE MADE 
HIS PREMIER LEAGUE DEBUT AGAINST 
EVERTON IN AUGUST TWO THOUSAND FOUR THE FLAG STAYS DOWN IT WAS ALL A LITTLE STATIONERY IN 
THE END AS HE FELL TO THE FLOOR 
IT WAS SUDDENLY CLEARED BY 
ALEXANDRE SONG ARSENAL JUST ASSUME 
THAT THERE WOULD BE AN OFFSIDE 
THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF IT A GREAT SAVE BY LUKASZ FABIANSKI 
PHIL JAGIELKA GETS A SECOND 
DENILSON JOLEON LESCOTT LUKASZ 
FABIANSKI POUNCES ON IT EVERTON 
ARE THE CLOSEST GOOD DOWNWARD HEADER BY PHIL 
JAGIELKA WHILE YOU WERE WATCHING 
THAT THIS HAPPENED THE BALL 
FLICKED OUT OF THE GRASP OF LUKASZ 
FABIANSKI BY JOLEON LESCOTT WHO 
WAS THEN BOOKED FOR HIS TROUBLES IT'S A TERRIFIC BALL TERM HOWARD WAS DOWN AT AT LIGHTNING PACE 
TERM HOWARD TIM HOWARD SUDDENLY 
THERE IS AN ATMOSPHERE AROUND THE 
EMIRATES STADIUM WILLIAM GALLAS AND EDGING IT BACK TO HIS GOALKEEPER NUDGING ITS DAVID MOYES WANTED AN INDIRECT FREE KICK EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR DID NOT GET 
ENOUGH ON IT REALLY AND IT JUST 
BOUNCED OFF HIS HEAD AND BE ON THE 
FAR POST IT'S AS GOOD AN OPENING 
AS ANY IN A HALF WHICH HAS HAD FEW 
CHANCES ESPECIALLY FOR A PLAYER 
WHO HAS SCORED SO OFTEN AS EMMANUEL 
ADEBAYOR TIM HOW WOULD THOUGHT ABOUT 
CATCHING AND THEN REALISED HE WAS 
PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO HANDLING 
OUTSIDE HIS AREA TERM HOWARD IT WILL GO OUT FOR A CORNER EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR THE TALLEST MAN 
IN THERE GILBERTO SILVA IS ALSO A 
TARGET THE STRANGEST OF CLEARANCES IT'S 
HIT TWO EVERTON PLAYERS AND WENT 
OUT FOR A CORNER THE TWO EVERTON 
PLAYERS GOT INTO A BIT OF A MIX UP 
HERE NOW AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 
ARSENAL TO MAKE A COUPLE OF 
SUBSTITUTIONS THAT'S UNUSUAL TO 
SAY THE LEAST JENS LEHMANN FOUR 
LUKASZ FABIANSKI HE GETS A ROUSING STAND INNERVATION STANDING OVATION NICKLAS BENDTNER TERRIFIC GOAL IT WAS ALWAYS GOING 
TO TAKE SOMETHING VERY VERY 
SPECIAL TO BREAK EVERTON DOWN TODAY 
AND IT WAS A LOVELY MOVE BY ARSENAL 
WICKED BALL IN AND A TERRIFIC 
HEADER BY NICKLAS BENDTNER FINALLY 
THEY MANAGED TO GET ROUND THE BACK 
OF EVERTON WELL WORKED GOAL THE FIRST TIME 
EVERTON HAS REALLY BEEN BROKEN DOWN 
LEE CARSLEY WAS BEATEN TO IT IN THE 
AIR FAIR AND SQUARE HE GETS A HUG 
FROM HIS STRIKE PARTNER AND 
CHEERING FROM ARSENE WENGER STEVEN PIENAAR COURT A 
FREE KICK TO EVERTON JUST ENTERING 
THE SECOND MINUTE OF ADDED TIME 
THEY HAVE THROWN INEVITABLY THE 
LIKES OF THE OBOE AND JOSEPH YOBO 
FORWARD IT WAS A GOOD CHANCE IT 
WAS A REALLY GOOD CHANCE HE IS OF THERE WAS NO CONTROL IT JUST 
FIRES BEHIND THE GOAL INTO THE 
EVERTON SUPPORTERS THAT WAS A 
CHANCE TO SAVE THE POINT WHICH 
WOULD HAVE GOT THEM INTO THE UEFA 
CUP TODAY IT WAS ONLY EVER A 
FLICKERING HOPE THAT MANCHESTER 
KNIGHTED AND CHELSEA WOULD WIN 
ANOTHER GAME THIS SEASON HE KNEW 
THE GAME WAS UP SOME TIME AGO 
REGARDING WINNING THE TITLE THREE 
MINUTES OF ADDED TIME COMPLETE 
THIS REALLY IS THE LAST SECONDS OF 
THE GAME THAT'S HOW THE SEASON WILL END 
DAVID MOYES GAVE AN AWFUL LOT TO 
THIS GAME THERE ARE STILL 
SEARCHING FOR THE POINT WHICH WOULD 
GET THEIR NEW WAFER CUP FOOTBALL 
ARSENAL GO IN PURSUIT OF ANOTHER 
WIN WHICH WILL TAKE THEM TO EIGHTY THREE 
POINTS AND WHO KNOWS EVEN THAT 
RUNNERS UP SPOT SHOULD CHELSEA 
FALTER NICKLAS BENDTNER GOT THE 
ONLY GOAL OF THE GAME 
A IT'S A TIME FOR REFLECTION HOW 
WILL YOU LOOK BACK ON THIS 
CAMPAIGN 
THE WAY WE PLAYED WAS CAMPAIGN OUTSTANDING THROUGHOUT THE SEASON 
THE COMMITMENT AND ATTITUDE OF THE 
TEAM WAS A JOY TO SEE ON A DAILY 
BASIS WE CAME OUT OF EIGHTY POINTS AT 
THE MOMENT WE CAN MAKE EIGHTY THREE 
EXCELLENT WE DID NOT LOSE ONE GAME 
AT HOME IN ANY COMPETITION 
OVERALL OF COURSE WE HAVE A BIG 
DISAPPOINTMENT AS WELL BUT WE WERE 
SO CLOSE SO THAT HIS APPOINTMENT 
IS EVEN BIGGER WE FEEL WE CAN COME 
BACK NEXT YEAR AND DO IT 
DAVID A 
DEFEAT BUT A LOT OF POSITIVES TODAY 
I'M SURE 
YES A LOT OF 
DISAPPOINTMENT THAT WE DID NOT GET 
THE POINT WHICH WOULD HAVE SECURED 
FIRST PLACE BUT THE PERFORMANCE 
WAS GOOD THE PLAYERS STUCK AT IT 
AND WE GOT ONE OR TWO OPPORTUNITIES 
IT'S DIFFICULT COMING HERE BECAUSE 
THEY HAVE GOT SO MUCH POSSESSION 
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT COUNT L. 
THOUGHT FOR MOST OF THE GAME WE DID 
THAT 
THIS SO MANY GOOD THINGS TO THAT TAKE FROM THE SEASON DESPITE THE 
DISAPPOINTMENT OF NOT CLINCHING THE 
TITLE 
YES PROGRESSION HAS BEEN TITLE THE MAIN THING THIS SEASON OUR 
PERFORMANCE AWAY AS A CLUB AND A 
TEAM I THINK WE CAN PUSH IT EVEN 
MORE NEXT SEASON NEXT SEASON WE 
WILL BE IN FOR A VERY GOOD SHOT OF 
THE TITLE 
HER THREE WE WILL LEARN 
FROM THIS SEASON WE HAVE 
PROGRESSED HOPEFULLY WE WILL 
LEARN FROM THIS SEASON IN MARCH 
WE WILL KICK ON 
WAS IT AN 
EMOTIONAL DAY FOR YOU 
YES VERY 
EMOTIONAL L. GOT TO PLAY IN THE 
FINAL GAME OF THE SEASON THE HOME 
GAME AND I APPRECIATE THAT 
BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SAY 
GOODBYE TO THE SUPPORTERS THE FUR 
WELL I HAD WILL ALWAYS STAY IN MY 
MIND THE CLUB AND SUPPORTERS WILL 
ALWAYS STAY IN MY HEART 
HE WAS 
ALWAYS PROFESSIONAL FOR THE SEVEN 
YEARS HE WAS HERE OVERALL OF 
COURSE HE DESERVES IT BECAUSE HE 
HAS CONTRIBUTED A LOT TO THE 
SUCCESS OF THE CLUB AND WE WILL 
MISS HIM HE IS A VERY 
IMPORTANT PLAYER ON AND OFF THE 
PITCH 
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF PITCH EVERTON 
I THOUGHT THEY PLAYED VERY EVERTON WELL ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST HALF 
DAVID MOYES WAS RIGHT A LOT OF 
PERFORMANCES A LOT OF GOOD POINTS 
COME OUT OF THEIR PERFORMANCE EVER 
SO WELL ORGANISED IN MIDFIELD THEY 
STOPPED ARSENAL PLAYING GREAT 
LENGTHS IN THE GAME WITH ASTON 
VILLA LOSING YESTERDAY IT WAS A 
GREAT CHANCE TO GET THE POINT FOR 
EUROPE NEXT WEEK I THINK THEY 
WILL GET THE POINT THEY DESERVE IT 
OUT OF THE TWO OF THEM THEY 
DESERVED TO TAKE THE UEFA CUP SPOT 
WHAT ABOUT ARSENAL AS A WHOLE 
WELL WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON 
WITH MATHIEU FLAMINI CENTRE 
MIDFIELD CENTRE BACK THEY 
SPLATTERED AROUND TODAY WHAT I WAS 
KEEN TO WATCH TODAY WAS THEO 
WALCOTT L. HAVE WATCHED HIM IN 
RECENT GAMES TO SEE HOW HE HAS BEEN 
PERFORMING A HUGE AMOUNT OF 
PRESSURE SINCE THE WORLD CUP ON HIM 
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN THE WORLD 
CUP AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED L. 
JUST WANT TO SEE HOW HIS GAME HAS 
DEVELOPED ARSENE WENGER HAS BEEN 
COMPLIMENTARY OF HIM LATELY L. LIKE 
THE WAY YOU WORK FOR THE OPPOSITION 
FULL BACK TODAY YOU WANT TO GIVE 
HIM THE BALL AS OFTEN AS YOU CAN 
HIS JOB IS TO UPSET TONY HIBBERT 
HERE IS GAEL CLICHY ON THE BALL HE 
POPS IT OFF HE SPINS YOU MIGHT 
SAY IT'S NOT A LOT BUT HE HAS PUT 
SOMETHING IN THE DEFENDER'S MIND 
HE COMES SHORTER TO THE BALL LOOKS 
OVER HIS SHOULDER AND HE IS AWAY 
HE HAS GOT AN ELECTRIC PACE TONY 
HIBBERT DOES WELL TO GET BACK 
CLICHY IS TIGHT SPINS IT INTO THE 
HOLE AND HE IS WAVE THIS IS THE 
PART OF THE GAME WHEN HE HAS TO GET 
THE BETTER OF HIS FULL BACK POOR 
CROSS AGAIN CLICHY GETS THE BALL 
AND IS NICE AND SHORT CROWD 
CONTROL THE GAP IS NOW BEHIND HIM 
BUT BECAUSE HE IS OUT OF POSITION 
CLICHY SEES THAT HE HAS A RUN 
GOOD PASS IF YOU KEEP WORKING THE 
FULL BACK LIKE THAT IN THE EARLY 
PARTS OF THE GAME WHEN HE IS 
PLAYING WING A. N. N. HAS SAID IN THE 
PAST THAT HE IS BETTER IN OTHER 
PARTS OF THE PITCH MAN MACRO HE 
SOMETIMES DRIFTS IN WHEN HE DOES 
NOT NEED TO THAT IS SOMETHING HE 
HAS TO LEARN WHEN HE GETS OLDER 
ADEBAYOR HAS WON AGAINST ONE ON 
HIBBERT THERE WAS A HUGE AMOUNT OF 
SPACE BEHIND HIM IT TAKES ONE 
SHORT TOUCH AND THEN ANOTHER TOUCH 
HIBBERT GETS BACK BECAUSE THE BALL 
IS NOT FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM 
WOOLCOTT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
PITCH HE HAS COME OFF HIS WING 
WHICH IS FINE BUT HE HAS A HUGE 
AMOUNT OF SPACE IN FRONT OF HIM HE 
SHOULD PASS ON TO ADEBAYOR OR WIDE 
ON THE LEFT WHAT HE DOES HE RUNS 
AND RUNS THEN HE HAS NO ROOM TO 
PLAY CLICHY IS STONE TO MAKE A RUN 
WHICH CREATES THE SPACE ON THE LEFT 
FULL ALLCOTT IS GOING TO WHEN 
YOU RING A GOOD POSITION JUST 
STAND IF THESE DAYS WIDE HE GETS 
THE BALL OF CLICHY HE JUST CREATES 
TROUBLE AND IT CLOSES THE SPACE 
DOWN THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE 
EIGHT PLAYERS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
PITCH WILL TO THE LEFT YOU WILL 
COURT HAS COME OFF HIS WING AGAIN 
THEO WALCOTT THEN HE PANICS AND 
IT IS I HAVE TO TRY AND MAKE RUN 
HE IS NOT IN PARTICULARLY GOOD 
POSITION HIS GAME IS BASED ON PACE 
HE IS AN EXCEPTIONAL FOOTBALLER BUT 
HE HAS TO LEARN THE SIDE OF THE 
GAME ABOUT DECISION MAKING 
THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH FLAMINI A. C. 
MILAN SAY HE IS OUT OF CONTRACT HE 
IS GOING TO SIGN A FOUR YEAR DEAL 
WITH A. C. MILAN TOMORROW WE WILL SEE 
WHAT COMES TO PASS 
HE WILL BE VERY 
MISSED BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN 
EXCEPTIONAL THIS SEASON FABREGAS 
HAS HAD SUCH A GOOD SEASON BECAUSE 
HE HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO GET FORWARD 
MORE SOMEBODY LIKE GARETH BARRY 
WOULD FILL HIS SHOES BETTER BUT 
PERHAPS VILLA DO NOT NEED TO SELL 
STILL TO COME THE HIGHLIGHTS OF 
SVEN'S PENULTIMATE AWAY TRIP WITH 
CITY TO ENFIELD BEATING THE DROP 
WIGAN'S STYLE MIDDLESBROUGH A 
STYLE AND BOLTON STYLE AND THE 
BEST OF TWO G. O. O. D. TWO B. A D. INCLUDING A 
CHARMING LADY AT THE EMIRATES AND 
THE PITFALLS OF BARGING YOUR WAY IN 
STYLE TO OLD TRAFFORD 
I AM A BIT 
WORRIED ABOUT THE STRANGE NOISES 
DOES THAT ALWAYS HAPPEN 
WE ARE 
WE ARE ONLY FOUR FOR A DEEP LIVERPOOL LIVERPOOL VERSUS MAN CITY LIVERPOOL FANS 
WERE STILL REELING FROM THE 
UNFAMILIAR FEELING OF DEFEAT AT THE 
HANDS OF CHELSEA IN THE CHAMPIONS' 
LEAGUE CITY FANS WERE STILL COMING 
TO TERMS WITH THE MANAGER THEY WERE 
NOT KEEN ON IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT 
QUICKLY FELL IN LOVE WITH 
CITY FANS WHO REMEMBERS THE HEAVY 
HE REMEMBERS THE HEADY DAYS OF 
AUTUMN SVEN IS SET FOR THE CHOP 
SINCE SIR ALEC TOOK CHARGE OF THE 
ROAD CITY HAVE HAD TWELVE MANAGERS 
SO RELICS RAFA CAN REFLECT ON HIS 
SEASON IN WHICH LIVERPOOL HAVE 
CLOSED THE GAP ON THE LEADERS 
THEY'RE RANIA FOURTEEN POINTS OF FIRST 
PLACE IN INTO TODAY'S GAME THEY 
ARE RUN LEAVE FOURTEEN POINTS OF FIRST 
PLACE GOING INTO TODAY'S GAME 
THEY ARE ONLY THE FANS ARE SHOWN 
HOW MUCH SVEN MEANS TO THEM WILL 
THAKSIN SHINAWATT LISTEN ALMOST 
CERTAINLY NOT RYAN THEY WILL FLICKED IT OVER THE TOP RYAN THEY WILL HEADING IS NOT 
HIS STRONG POINT HE WAS ONSIDE JOE HART WAS NOT SURE WHICH SIDE OF HIS POST THAT WAS PASSING THE CITY 
KEEPER WAS AT FULL STRETCH JERED 
HIT ONE IN HIS DIRECTION AT FULL 
TILT HOPING FOR A BIT OF COLE GREATER EFFORT WOULD BE SAVED BY 
JOE HART GREAT EFFORT WHAT A 
SAVE JOE HART WAS AT FULL STRETCH TO TIP 
IT PAST THE POST SVEN GORAN 
ERIKSSON RESPONSE TO THE NON STOP 
CHANTING OF HIS NAME AND SUPPORT 
FOR HIM FROM THE MANCHESTER CITY 
FANS JONSSON SCREAMS FOR A HAND BALL AND A PENALTY SAMI HYYPIA LEANED INTO IT LEFT SHOULDER LIVERPOOL LOOKING TO IMPROVE THEIR 
GAME AND REDUCED THAN EIGHT 
SUCCESSIVE HOME PREMIER LEAGUE WIN 
REGISTER AND EIGHTTH SUCCESSIVE 
HOME PREMIER LEAGUE WIN RAFA BENITEZ HAS CLEARLY SAID 
SOMETHING TO REIGNITE THE SPARK IN 
HIS SIDE PETROV KEPT ON GOING BEFORE BEING 
FORCED OFF BALANCE IT IS ENOUGH 
FOR A CITY FREE KICK IN A VERY 
USEFUL POSITION OF THE FIELD THERE 
IS A RICH APPLAUSE FROM ALL FOUR 
SIDES OF ANFIELD SUPERBUG EFFORT SUPERBUG EFFORT TORRES IS IN THE REST WAS INEVITABLE TWELVE MINUTES INTO THE SECOND HALF 
FERNANDO TORRES TAKES HIS TOTAL TO 
THIRTY TWO FOR THE SEASON A HORROR MOMENT 
FOR MICHAEL BALL IT WAS HE WHO 
GAVE IT AWAY TORRES MANAGED TO 
STAY ON HIS FEET DESPITE A TAG ON 
HIS CHAT FROM RICHARD DUNN 
DESPITE RICHARD DUNN PULLING HIS 
SHIRT HE EQUALLED ROGER HUNT'S RECORD 
FROM THE DIVISION TWO DAYS OF THE 
EARLY SIXTIES IT IS GOING TO BE A CORNER LIVERPOOL HAVE BEEN DENIED TWICE BY JOE HART THAT WAS A GREAT CROSS BUT IT HIT THE BAR WHAT ABOUT THAT FROM SAMI HYYPIA 
HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT HE HAD SCORED 
HE COULD NOT DO A LOT MORE THAN 
THAT HE SKIED IT WHAT A CHANCE RICHARD DUNN JUST COULD NOT KEEP 
TORRES ARAB OF HIS PENALTY AREA 
OUT OF HIS PENALTY AREA LIVERPOOL 
HAD THE PERFECT CHANCE TO MAKE IT 
TWO TO ZERO SVEN GORAN ERIKSSON IS SO 
CRITICAL OF HIS TEAM THAT IS A FREE KICK BENJANI WAS DRAGGED DOWN THAT WAS FAST AND STRAIGHT AT PEPE 
REINA HE ALMOST WENT TOO FAR THE 
CURVE IS SIGNIFICANT DYNAMIC STUFF FROM JAVIER MASCHERANO HE WAS JUST TOO CLOSE TO THE CITY KEEPER 
I AM SURE WOODEN STABLES MUCKED 
DEFEAT STILL THAT BUT DOES THAT 
HELP IT A LITTLE WEDNESDAY'S 
DEFEAT 
I WAS HOPING TO SEE THE DEFEAT TEAM IN THE FINAL SO I AM A LITTLE 
DISAPPOINTED BUT I CANNOT CHANGE 
THINGS SO I HAVE TO KEEP THINKING 
ABOUT HOW WE CAN IMPROVE L. SAY 
THANK YOU TO OUR SUPPORTERS IT WAS 
REALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY 
WINNING 
WE MAY BE EXPECTED A BIT WINNING MORE FROM THIS SEASON BUT IN 
FOOTBALL YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT IS 
GOING TO HAPPEN NOW WE HAVE TO 
PLAY ONE MORE GAME THEN WE GO ON 
HOLIDAY TO RECHARGE THE BATTERIES 
AND THEN THERE IS A NEW SEASON 
THERE HAS BEEN LOT OF RUMOURS AND 
SPECULATION OF COURSE IF YOU DO 
NOT SPEAK OUT CLEARLY THERE IS 
SPECULATION BUT I THINK WHAT WE 
HAVE TO DO NOW IS TRY AND MAKE A 
GOOD PERFORMANCE THEN WE HAVE TIME 
TO TALK 
CAN YOU TELL US EXACTLY 
WHAT IS GOING ON THERE SEEMS TO BE 
QUITE A BIT OF CONFUSION 
I CANNOT 
AND EVEN IF I COULD I WOULD NOT DO 
IT BECAUSE I DO NOT THINK IS FAIR 
AGAINST ANYONE TO SPEAK OUT BEFORE 
THE SEASON IS FINISHED IT IS ONE 
WEEK SO WE HAVE TO HAVE PATIENCE 
WE MUST TRY TO MAKE A VERY GOOD 
MATCH 
I SUPPOSE THE FANS JUST WANT MATCH TO KNOW WHAT THEIR FUTURE IS GOING 
TO BE THAT IS THE FRUSTRATING PART 
OF IT FOR THEM 
I UNDERSTAND THAT 
OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IT 
IS ONE GAME TO GO LET'S PLAY THAT 
GAME IT IS TIME TO TALK AFTER THAT 
WE WILL MAKE SOME MORE THAT SPECULATIONS ABOUT ENSURED LEAVE 
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE GAME NOT NOT A LOT IT HAD THAT END OF SEASON 
FEEL LIVERPOOL HAVE A HANGOVER 
AFTER THE LEAGUE IT LOOKED LIKE 
GET THROUGH THE GAME AND THE END OF 
THE SEASON IS AROUND THE CORNER 
THEY DID ALL THE HARD WORK EARLY IN 
THE SEASON WE TRIED TO PUT SOME 
ANALYSIS TOGETHER LIKE WE ALWAYS DO 
BUT WE COULD NOT REALLY WE JUST 
HAD TO DO THE BEST OF AND THE WORST 
OF YOU DECIDE WHICH IS WHICH 
DIRK KUYT HAD THE BEST BOLLEY A 
GREAT SAVE BY JOE HART IT WAS A 
GOOD GOAL TYPICAL BY FERNANDO 
TORRES HE GOES INSIDE AND THEN 
OUTSIDE TO CREATE SPACE WHAT THEY 
KICK THIS IS FROM JOSE REINA IT 
GOES FIFTY OR SIXTY YARDS FERNANDO 
TORRES GREAT TOUCH THIS IS THE 
WORST CROSSFIELD PASS I'VE EVER 
SEEN 
I HAVE SEEN WORSE 
RYAN THEY SEEN WILL GREAT WORK ON THE RIGHT 
RYAN THEY WILL THIS IS THE WORST 
RUN OF I HAVE EVER SEEN DIRK KUYT 
AS HE LOOKS ACROSS THE LINE HE HAS 
GOT TO SLOW DOWN BUT NO HE KEEPS 
ON RUNNING LOOK HOW FAR OFFSIDE HE 
IS NO IDEA HE ENDS UP PUTTING THE 
BALL IN THE NETS BUT IT IS 
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE AND HE KNOWS 
HOPEFULLY HE'S NOT GOING TO DO THAT 
AGAIN 
A WHAT ABOUT MAN CITY AND AGAIN SVEN GORAN ERIKSSON 
I HAVE BEEN 
GETTING PHONE CALLS FROM ALL MY 
FANS 
ALL OF YOUR FANS MEAN FANS MY FRIENDS THE MAN CITY FANS ARE

TRYING TO CREATE GOOD SIDE THEY 
HAD A GREAT START TO THE SEASON AND 
HAVE FALLEN AWAY TOWARDS THE END 
OF THE SEASON BUT THEY STILL COULD

WIN THEIR LAST GAME IT'S BAD NEWS 
HE HAS HAD THE RUG PULLED FROM 
UNDER HIM SVEN GORAN ERIKSSON
