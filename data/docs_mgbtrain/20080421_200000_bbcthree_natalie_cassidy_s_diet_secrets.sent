MY NAME'S NATALIE CASSIDY 
BUT FOR THIRTEEN YEARS YOU'VE KNOWN ME 
AS THE NATION'S BEST KNOWN PODGY TEENAGER SONIA IN EASTENDERS' 
SORRY WE DON'T ALLOW KIDS IN HERE 
SHE WON'T BE ANY TROUBLE A PINT PLEASE 
AND A WHISKY CHASER 
ALL THAT TIME I GREW UP WITH MY PICTURE IN MAGAZINES 
I WAS SNAPPED AT AWARDS CEREMONIES 
AND ON THE STREETS OF ISLINGTON WHERE I LIVED 
BUT THAT WAS ON THE OUTSIDE 
WHAT YOU DIDN'T SEE WAS ME GROWING UP ON THE INSIDE TOO 
DEALING WITH THOUGHTS WHICH MADE ME CONSTANTLY TRY TO LOSE WEIGHT 
WHAT'S ALL THIS FOR 
WHAT DO YOU WANT 
I WANT TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR YOU 
BY FIFTEEN I WAS DIETING AND TRYING ANYTHING I'D READ ABOUT 
THAT'S NICE THAT'S FAB 
FINALLY I LOST LOADS OF WEIGHT THE SENSIBLE WAY THE BORING WAY 
BIG SMILE NAT 
I STOPPED TRYING FOR A QUICK FIX AND IT WORKED 
I FEEL LIKE I'VE LEFT BEHIND AN INCREASINGLY FREAKY WORLD OF DIETING 
WHERE WE READ EVERY WEEK THAT CELEBRITIES WILL TRY ANYTHING 
TO LOSE WEIGHT 
MAPLE SYRUP BABY FOOD EVEN TOOTHPASTE 
SO HOW'S IT GOT THIS WEIRD 
AND IS IT SUCKING GIRLS LIKE ME 
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL 
SO HERE I AM BACK IN ALBERT SQUARE 
IT'S OVER A YEAR SINCE I LEFT AND I'M NEARLY FOUR STONE LIGHTER 
YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHEN I WAS HERE 
WAS THE AMOUNT OF FADDY DIETS I USED TO DO 
ATKINS EATING MEAT AND CHEESE ONLY 
FRUIT DIETS JUST EATING FRUIT 
I'M HERE TO REVISIT MY FAD DIETING DAYS 
WITH SOMEONE WHO BECAME MY FRIEND IN THOSE YEARS 
MY COSTUME MISTRESS CLAIRE 
OH 
THE DRESS SONIA'S WEDDING DRESS 
LOOK I WAS SORT OF SLIM THEN YEAH FOR EASTENDERS DAYS 
BUT NOW THAT WAS YOU KNOW THAT'D BE A BIT BIG ON YOU NOW YEAH 
COS I THINK I STARTED LOOKING AT FOOD IN A DIFFERENT WAY 
WHEN I WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WHY DO YOU THINK THAT WAS 
WELL I THINK PERSONALLY IT'S COS YOUR MUM STOPPED COMING WITH YOU 
AND YOU HAD NO CHAPERONE YEAH 
YOU JUST DID YOUR OWN THING WHICH WAS YEAH 
THE KIDS THAT COME IN NOW THERE'S A REAL CHANGE ISN'T THERE 
THERE IS WHAT AGE NOW 
EVEN THE YOUNG ONES EVEN SOME OF THE GIRLS AT ELEVEN 
YEAH ARE SAYING OH I'M FAT OR REALLY YEAH 
HONESTLY IT'S VERY WARPED 
I HAVE SEEN A BIG I MEAN EVEN IN THE ADULTS AS WELL 
THE WAY PEOPLE PERCEIVE THEMSELVES AND THE WAY THEY PRESENT THEMSELVES IT'S JUST TOTALLY DIFFERENT 
BEING A SCHOOLGIRL ONE MOMENT AND A WELL KNOWN SOAP STAR THE NEXT 
PUT ME IN A VERY STRANGE POSITION AS I WAS GROWING UP 
AND I CAN'T PRETEND IT DIDN'T HAVE AN EFFECT ON ME 
GOING BACK TO EASTENDERS TODAY YOU KNOW 
IT'S REALLY MADE ME THINK ABOUT 
THE PRESSURE I USED TO BE UNDER AS A CHILD 
IN A SHOW THAT WAS ON TELLY FOUR TIMES A WEEK 
BUT FROM THE AGE OF ABOUT SIXTEEN I USED TO DREAD GOING TO THESE AWARDS CEREMONIES YOU KNOW 
OR ANY KIND OF PUBLIC DO 
COS YOU'D ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT THE PICTURES THEY'D TAKE 
AND PUT IN MAGAZINES TO HAVE A GO AT YOU 
YOU KNOW IT WAS ALWAYS KIND OF FAT SONIA 
OR OH SONIA'S JUST GOT WASHED UP ON SEA 
LIKE TALKING LIKE I'M A BEACHED WHALE AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
AND NOW YOU KNOW I HAVE LOST WEIGHT 
AND I HAVE DONE IT FOR MYSELF 
BUT THERE IS A BIG PART OF ME THAT KIND OF 
STICKS TWO FINGERS UP TO THEM AND SAYS LOOK HA HA 
YOU CAN'T REALLY HAVE A GO AT ME NOW ABOUT MY WEIGHT 
YOU CAN CALL ME UGLY IF YOU LIKE 
BUT YOU KNOW I'VE CRACKED ONE SIDE OF IT 
IT IS QUITE SAD THAT THAT MATTERS 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY IN THE JOB I DO 
BEING IN THE PUBLIC EYE IT DOES 
IT WAS EVENTS LIKE THIS A RED CARPET FILM PREMIER 
THAT I USED TO DREAD THE MOST 
WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON AT THE MOMENT I'M DOING A DOCUMENTARY FOR B. B. C. THREE 
AND I'VE JUST I'M ABOUT TO START REHEARSALS 
FOR THE CHERRY ORCHARD BY CHEKHOV 
AFTER THAT FILM PREMIER 
THIS IS A WEEKLY RITUAL I'VE GOT USED TO OVER THE YEARS' 
O. K. THIS IS MY LOCAL NEWSAGENT'S 
AND TODAY IS A BIG DAY FOR THE MAGAZINE INDUSTRY 
IT'S TUESDAY AND ALL THE MAGAZINES COME OUT TODAY 
I KNOW THAT FROM EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IF I'VE BEEN TO AWARDS CEREMONIES 
YOU PANIC ABOUT WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO GET A TICK OR A CROSS NEXT TO YOUR NAME 
HEAT LOOK WHAT I CAN'T BELIEVE IS MY DAD WAS A NEWSAGENT 
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AT THE AGE OF ABOUT FOURTEEN FIFTEEN 
I USED TO GET JUST SEVENTEEN SMASH HITS IT WAS MORE ABOUT MUSIC STORIES 
AND I THINK THESE MAKE KIDS GROW UP MUCH FASTER 
I'M ON THAT ONE LOOK 
OF COURSE I'LL BE CHECKING UP HOW MANY COLUMN INCHES ARE DEVOTED TO ME THIS WEEK 
AFTER THAT PREMIER 
BUT I'M ALSO GOING TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT HOW THESE MAGAZINES REPORT 
WHAT EXACTLY CELEBRITIES ARE PUTTING IN THEIR MOUTHS IF ANYTHING 
WHAT I ATE TODAY I HAD A CUP OF TEA WITH MILK AND ONE SUGAR 
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE IT REALLY IS 
I'M BACK TO A SIZE EIGHT BUT I'VE STILL GOT A JELLY BELLY 
OH THERE'S ONE THERE 
I LOST WEIGHT EATING CHOCOLATE 
I MEAN IT'S ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS 
AS EXPECTED MY FILM PREMIER APPEARANCE 
HASN'T ESCAPED THE DIET POLICE 
WEIGHT GAIN I'M SLIMMER THAN EVER 
BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER SAYING THAT 
YOU KNOW A PART OF ME CAN'T SIT AND MOAN 
BECAUSE I DID A FITNESS D. V. D. WHICH BRINGS IT ALL OUT INTO THE OPEN 
I DID IT BECAUSE I WANTED TO LOSE WEIGHT FEEL BETTER ABOUT MYSELF 
AND I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHY NOT DO A D. V. D. AS WELL 
AND IT'S A GOOD EARNER TOO YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO BE HONEST ABOUT THESE THINGS 
BUT WHEN YOU GET THE ABSOLUTE PRESSURE OF YOU KNOW 
ALL THIS KEEPING IT OFF KEEPING IT OFF THEY'RE ALWAYS WAITING FOR YOU 
TO GET REALLY FAT OR LOSE EVEN MORE WEIGHT 
AND BE A LOLLIPOP HEAD WHATEVER YOU KNOW 
I'M CUTTING OUT EVERY RELEVANT THING TO DO WITH WEIGHT LOSS AND DIET 
BLUE IS THE LEAST APPETIZING COLOUR OF ALL 
THREE APPARENTLY POSH SPICE'S LATEST DIET SECRET 
IS THE JUICE OF ASAI BERRIES BOOSTING ENERGY AND WEIGHT LOSS 
FOUR JENNIFER ANISTON IS SUPPOSEDLY ON A DIET OF BABY FOOD 
ACCORDING TO THE MAGAZINE EXPERT IT'S A GREAT QUICK FIX 
FIVE ONE ANONYMOUS CELEB USES THE CHOCOLATE CAKE DIET 
SHE STARES AT A CHOCOLATE CAKE FOR HALF AN HOUR 
HAS A GLASS OF WATER 
THEN WALKS OUT OF THE ROOM 
SOMETHING TELLS ME I HAVE TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH OF THIS IS REALLY TRUE 
AND I WANT TO MEET SOMEONE WHO'S TRIED ALL THIS STUFF 
I FOUND HER IN ABERDEEN 
MEET VICTORIA 
SHE'S TWENTY ONE AND SHE'S TRIED EVERY FAD DIET OUT THERE 
FROM THE FINGERNAIL DIET WHERE YOU EAT TINY PIECES OF FOOD EVERY FOURTEEN MINUTES 
TO THE WATER FASTING DIET 
A DIET THAT ISN'T REALLY A DIET AT ALL 
BECAUSE IT CONTAINS ABSOLUTELY NO CALORIES 
VICKY LIKES TO KEEP FIT BY POLE DANCING 
AND SINCE SHE'S STARTED DIETING 
SHE'S WEIGHED BETWEEN SEVEN AND FOURTEEN STONE 
SHE SAYS CONTROLLING WHAT SHE EATS HELPS HER FEEL IN CONTROL OF HER LIFE 
TO BE HONEST I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME 
I'VE EVER SAT DOWN AND ATE A MEAL 
WITHOUT AT LEAST LOOKING AT IT FIRST AND CONTEMPLATING WHAT I'M ABOUT TO PUT IN MY MOUTH 
AND WHAT IT'S EXACTLY ABOUT TO DO TO ME 
WELL HER DOG SEEMS TO BE TARGET WEIGHT 
BUT VICTORIA IS STILL TRAPPED IN THE DIETING WORLD 
WHY HAVE YOU BEEN DIETING FOR SO LONG 
UM I THINK COS I WAS A LOT BIGGER IN SCHOOL 
AND DIDN'T LOSE MY PUPPY FAT AS FAST AS EVERYONE ELSE DID 
WHEN I WAS ABOUT TWELVE THIRTEEN I WAS STILL REALLY QUITE HEAVY 
TWELVE IT WASN'T UNTIL I LEFT SCHOOL WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN THAT I STARTED TO LOSE WEIGHT 
SO WHICH DIETS HAVE YOU ACTUALLY TRIED 
UM I'VE TRIED THE ATKINS DIET 
WATER FAST DIETS THE RAW FRESH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE DIET 
I'VE TRIED LIQUIDATION DIETS 
I'VE TRIED UM THE CABBAGE SOUP DIET UM 
A FEW DIETS THEN YEAH QUITE A FEW THEN 
AFTER AN HOUR WITH VICTORIA 
I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER WHAT MAKES A BEAUTIFUL CLEVER GIRL LIKE HER DO DIETS' 
I'VE GOT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE WAY YOU LOOK O. K. 
BECAUSE I'M FLABBERGASTED 
THAT YOU FEEL YOU NEED TO GO ON A CRASH DIET 
I THINK IT'S JUST ALL IN MY MIND INSECURITY MORE THAN ANYTHING WHAT SIZE ARE YOU 
I'M AN EIGHT ON TOP AND A TEN ON THE BOTTOM 
IT'S A PERFECT SIZE WHICH I'M NOT UNHAPPY WITH BUT I ALWAYS LIKE TO LOSE THAT EXTRA POUND OR TWO 
I KNOW FAD DIETS AREN'T THE BEST WAY TO LOSE WEIGHT BUT IT'S NOT LONG TERM BUT YOU KNOW 
YOU TO ME ARE TALKING TO ME LIKE SOMEONE WHO WOULD NEVER DO A FAD DIET BECAUSE YOU'RE FAR TOO BRIGHT 
I KNOW THE INS AND OUTS OF IT BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S STILL TEMPTATION 
IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS EATING JUNK FOOD ISN'T GOOD FOR YOU BUT CAN'T HELP IT 
MM SO ARE YOU DOING A DIET AT THE MOMENT 
I'M GOING TO TRY THE MAPLE SYRUP DIET WHICH I HAVEN'T TRIED BEFORE MAPLE SYRUP 
IS THIS THE BEYONCE THING 
APPARENTLY FASTING IS SUPPOSED TO BE REALLY GOOD FOR YOU COMPARED TO DIETING 
IT'S THE NEW CRAZE BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU MUCH HEALTHIER HAIR SKIN NAILS 
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE DON'T ALL STOP EATING I'D LIKE TO SEE HOW MUCH TRUTH AND MYTH THERE IS BEHIND IT 
THIS IS THE MAPLE SYRUP IT'S VERY SPECIAL MAPLE SYRUP NOT LIKE YOU BUY IN THE SHOPS 
IT LOOKS LIKE PETROL IT DOES IT'S A LOVELY CAN IT COMES IN 
I WONDER SOMETIMES HOW I'M GOING TO GET IT DOWN THE THOUGHT OF DRINKING PURE SUGAR SOUNDS DISGUSTING 
BUT THE END RESULTS SOUND TOO TEMPTING 
I CAN UNDERSTAND IT DEFINITELY I CAN UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE I'M SOMEONE WHO HAS LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT 
BUT IN A SENSIBLE WAY 
YOU LOST WEIGHT THROUGH HEALTHY EATING AND DIET BUT EVEN THOUGH I'M COMFORTABLE AND HAPPY 
AS SOON AS YOU SAY TO ME YOU CAN DRINK THIS SHIT FOR FOUR DAYS 
AND LOSE A LOT OF WEIGHT 
IT MAKES ME SAY I WANNA DO IT WITH YOU I'LL DO IT WHY NOT 
FOURTEEN DESSERT SPOONS OF THIS YEP THAT'S RIGHT 
VICTORIA'S PLANNING TO DO THE MAPLE SYRUP DIET FOR TEN DAYS 
SHE CAN ONLY DRINK A LIQUID MIX OF SOME VERY STRANGE INGREDIENTS 
CAYENNE PEPPER WHICH IT'S CLAIMED SPEEDS UP THE METABOLISM 
AND LEMON JUICE WHICH APPARENTLY HELPS TO DISSOLVE MUCUS 
BUT THERE'S NO SCIENTIFIC PROOF OF THIS 
THE DIET WILL REDUCE HER CALORIE INTAKE FROM TWO THOUSAND A DAY TO JUST OVER THREE HUNDRED 
IT DOESN'T LOOK VERY NICE IT DOES NOT LOOK APPEALING 
IT'S A BIT LIKE POO IT'S NOT WHAT I EXPECTED IT TO LOOK LIKE 
I COULD DRINK THAT 
IS IT NOT TOO BAD TO ME THAT'S ACTUALLY PLEASANT 
LET'S SEE WHAT I THINK OF IT 
SUDDENLY SOMETHING VERY STRANGE IS HAPPENING IN MY MIND 
I'M BEING SUCKED IN BY THE POWERFUL ATTRACTION OF LOSING POUNDS 
MAYBE EVEN STONES ALMOST OVERNIGHT 
I THOUGHT I'D COME OUT SAYING OH THESE FAD DIETS ARE RIDICULOUS 
THEY ARE RIDICULOUS WE KNOW THEY'RE RIDICULOUS 
BUT I WANNA DO THAT DIET 
IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS SINCE I DID A DIET 
NOWADAYS I KEEP THE WEIGHT OFF BY DOING MY EXERCISE ROUTINES THREE TIMES A WEEK 
EATING THREE HEALTHY MEALS A DAY AND AVOIDING SNACKING 
SO I THOUGHT I'D CLOSED THE DOOR ON FAD DIETS 
BUT WITH MY TEMPTATION TO DO THE MAPLE SYRUP DIET THAT DOOR'S JUST SWUNG OPEN AGAIN 
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW IT COULD BE DANGEROUS 
BUT JUST HOW DANGEROUS 
I'M GOING TO THE DOCTOR'S 
MEL THANKS FOR SEEING ME I'M HERE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BODY 
WHEN KIDS GO ON THESE FAD DIETS 
THE FIRST EFFECT MOST OF US FIND WHEN WE GO ON A FADDY DIET IS THE EFFECTS ON OUR BRAIN 
CONCENTRATING AT SCHOOL OR UNIVERSITY FOCUSING AT WORK BEING NICE TO YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY 
THAT'S USUALLY THE FIRST THING THAT GOES LET'S TAKE THIS FRONT OFF AND LOOK INSIDE O. K. 
THERE'S ALL OUR ORGANS NICELY PACKED IN THERE 
SHALL I TAKE THAT OFF TAKE IT OFF OH IT'S ALL COME OUT SORRY 
ITS HEART OUT IT COMES YEAH THE NEXT THING THAT MOST OF US GIRLS OBVIOUSLY 
NOTICE IF WE GO ON A FADDY DIET WILL BE PROBLEMS DOWN HERE 
D'YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS THE GYNAE PART LADY'S BITS LADY'S BITS 
FALLOPIAN TUBES OUR OVARIES OUR WHOLE MENSTRUAL 
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS FOR LOTS OF US IS THAT WE SEE OUR PERIODS LESS OFTEN 
OR THEY GET PAINFUL OR BECOME ERRATIC AND UNPREDICTABLE 
SOMETIMES WE MAY NOT EVEN PRODUCE AN EGG EACH MONTH AND OUR PERIODS JUST STOP EXACTLY 
WOULD YOU SAY YOU SEE YOUNGSTERS COMING IN 
SUFFERING FROM STUFF TO DO WITH THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE BECAUSE OF DIETING 
ABSOLUTELY LOTS OF TIMES THEY HAVEN'T MADE THE LINK BETWEEN DIETING 
AND WHAT GOES ON WITH THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE 
WHAT IF FOR INSTANCE I WAS TO GO ON A DIET OF MAPLE SYRUP FOR FIVE DAYS 
GOODNESS YOU'RE NOT THINKING OF IT I DON'T KNOW YET JUST MAPLE SYRUP 
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN 
I THINK YOU'D LOOK ROUGH BAGS UNDER THE EYES SKIN LOSES ITS LUSTRE YOU LOOK PALE 
YEAH BAD TEETH BAD BREATH MM 
SNOTTY NOSE RUN DOWN GENERALLY SNOTTY NOSE WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
SNOTTY NOSE YOU'RE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO INFECTIONS 
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT EATING RIGHT YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM'S NOT GOT THE NUTRIENTS IT NEEDS 
TO FIGHT OFF INFECTIONS O. K. SO YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO PICK UP COLDS THAN IF YOU EAT RIGHT 
IT'S NOT A GOOD LOOK A SNOTTY NOSE 
THE MAPLE SYRUP DIET MAY BE TRENDY BUT IN FACT IT'S OVER FIFTY YEARS OLD 
INVENTED BY THIS MAN STANLEY BURROUGHS IT'S CLAIMED TO BE 
AN EFFECTIVE WEIGHT LOSS AND DETOX DIET WORRYINGLY 
MR. BURROUGHS WAS ONCE CONVICTED OF MANSLAUGHTER 
AFTER GIVING DIET ADVICE ILLEGALLY TO A PATIENT WHO THEN DIED 
DESPITE THIS I JUST CAN'T RESIST IT SO I'VE HAD A BLOOD TEST TO CHECK I'M HEALTHY 
AND NOW I'M EATING DIETICIAN BECKY STEVENSON 
YOU'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR THE SYMPTOMS 
YOU'LL FEEL LIGHT HEADED YOU MIGHT FEEL 
THAT YOU CAN'T CONCENTRATE QUITE AS WELL 
YOU'LL START TO FEEL REALLY TIRED FATIGUED 
AS A DIETICIAN I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS KIND OF DIET 
IT'S VERY VERY UNSAFE O. K. 
BEFORE SHE DOES THE DIET I'VE ALSO ASKED VICTORIA TO SEE HER OWN DOCTOR AND A DIETICIAN 
SHE'S CHECKING VICTORIA'S BODY MASS INDEX USING THIS INCREDIBLE MACHINE THE BOD POD 
AND FROM NOW ON VICTORIA AND I WILL BE MONITORED DAILY 
AND MUST STOP THE DIET IF IT BECOMES DANGEROUS 
WELL TODAY'S THE START OF THIS DIET 
AND I CAN'T REALLY BELIEVE I'M DOING IT TO BE HONEST 
BECAUSE WELL 
INTERVIEWING VICTORIA SHE SEEMED SO BRIGHT AND SO FUNNY AND CLEVER 
AND I JUST KEPT SAYING WHY ARE YOU DOING THESE DIETS 
AND NOW I'M KIND OF BOUGHT INTO THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT LOSING 
LOADS OF WEIGHT REALLY QUICKLY WHICH I CAN'T REALLY BELIEVE 
IN ABERDEEN VICTORIA'S A BIT MORE OF A STARVATION VETERAN THAN ME 
I'VE FELT FINE SO FAR BUT I'M USED TO GOING FOR A DAY WITHOUT EATING SO IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL TO ME 
ONCE I GET TO THREE OR FOUR DAYS IT'LL GET A BIT HARDER 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'LL GET EASIER COS THE LESS YOU EAT THE MORE YOUR STOMACH SHRINKS 
THE LESS FOOD YOU'RE ABLE TO HOLD SO IT TAKES YOU LESS TO GET FULL 
VICTORIA'S TOLD ME SHE STARTED DIETING AT TWELVE BECAUSE OF PRESSURES AT SCHOOL TO BE THINNER 
SO I WANT TO WORK OUT HOW MUCH PRESSURE THERE IS TO BE THE RIGHT SIZE 
AT THIS GIRLS SCHOOL IN SURREY I JOIN A CLASS OF FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS 
COULD YOU JUST LIST THE DIETS THAT YOU'VE HEARD OF 
ATKINS DIET SPECIAL K. 
CARB DIET EATING WITH CHILD'S CUTLERY 
EATING BABY FOOD HALF PLATE 
THE ZONE DIET THE SMOOTHIE DIET THE WEIGH FOODS DIET 
OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW YOUR DIETS WHO'S BEEN ON A DIET HERE HANDS UP 
WHERE DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THESE DIETS READING THINGS IN MAGAZINES 
YOU GET IDEAS FROM MAGAZINES AND WHAT CELEBRITIES DO AND STUFF 
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK YOU THINK ABOUT FOOD 
I CAN'T HELP THINKING NOW WHENEVER I SEE FOOD AND WANT TO EAT IT 
I CAN'T HELP GETTING GUILTY BECAUSE I FEEL THERE'S PRESSURE TO THINK I SHOULDN'T EAT THAT 
I SHOULD EAT SOMETHING MORE HEALTHY 
THERE WASN'T HEALTHY AND UNHEALTHY WHEN I WAS LITTLE I ATE WHAT I WANTED 
WELL I DID NOW HAVING ONE PACKET OF CRISPS I'D CLASS AS AN UNHEALTHY DAY 
I FEEL I NEED TO KNOW MORE FROM THESE GIRLS ABOUT WHAT PRESSURES THEY'RE UNDER TO LOOK GOOD 
SO I'M IN THE PLACE WHERE IT ALL HAPPENS 
GOSSIP CLOTHES AND OF COURSE BOYS 
TO MEET THE GROUP OF FRIENDS FROM CLASS WHO SEEM TO CARE ABOUT HOW THEY LOOK THE MOST 
YOU ALL RIGHT 
YOU ALL LOOK VERY GLAMOROUS 
AT LEAST THREE OF THESE GIRLS HAVE BEEN ON A DIET 
SO YOU ALL WEAR SKINNY JEANS YEAH 
I LOVE SKINNY JEANS WHAT SIZE ARE YOU IN TOP SHOP 
SIX TO EIGHT YOU'RE ALL THE SAME 
I KNOW I'D NEVER SQUEEZE INTO A PAIR OF SIZE SIX JEANS BUT ON THIS MAPLE SYRUP DIET I MIGHT DO 
GET THESE GIRLS SOME FOOD 
DO YOU USUALLY HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT UM SOMETIMES 
DO YOU FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT IF I HAD A LOT YEAH I WOULD 
REALLY DO YOU FEEL PRESSURE TO LOOK GOOD FOR BOYS 
YEAH 
I WANT TO MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION 
IT'S THE FIRST IMPRESSION AND YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO REMEMBER YOU LOOKING BAD 
DO YOU THINK THERE'S AN AWFUL PRESSURE AT SCHOOL WITH YOU AND THE OTHER GIRLS TO LOOK A CERTAIN WAY 
IT IS VERY COMPETITIVE BETWEEN GIRLS WHO LOOKS GOOD IF ANYBODY'S LOST WEIGHT WHETHER IT LOOKS GOOD OR NOT 
IF PEOPLE PUT ON WEIGHT WHAT THEY'RE DRESSED LIKE 
DO YOU NOTICE IF GIRLS IN YOUR CLASS HAVE PUT WEIGHT ON YES DO YOU TALK ABOUT IT SOMETIMES 
IS THE COMPETITION TO LOOK GOOD MORE FOR BOYS THAN OTHER GROUPS OF GIRLS 
GIRLS DEFINITELY 
THAT HAS TO DO WITH BOYS IF YOU LOOK BETTER THAN A GROUP OF GIRLS YOU'LL GET MORE ATTENTION FROM BOYS 
SO IT'S JUST A CIRCLE IT'S A VICIOUS CIRCLE I WAS GOING TO SAY 
I RECKON THE COMPETITION AT MOST SCHOOLS COULD EASILY GIVE LOTS OF GIRLS THE URGE TO DIET 
BUT I DAREN'T TELL THE GIRLS I'VE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED THAT URGE MYSELF 
IT'S DAY THREE OF THE MAPLE SYRUP DIET ALREADY I'VE LOST FOUR POUNDS 
I THOUGHT I'D JUST SHOW YOU 
MY RIBCAGE 
IT'S POKING OUT A BIT WHICH IS A BIT RUBBISH 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S VERY ATTRACTIVE TO BE HONEST 
ALTHOUGH IT IS KIND OF QUITE SATISFYING 
A VERY FLAT STOMACH 
BUT IT'S MAINLY MY WATER AND ENERGY STORES BEING BURNT OFF 
NOT MY FAT THAT'S CAUSING THE VISIBLE CHANGES IN MY BODY SHAPE 
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE EXPERIENCING THOSE CHANGES 
HERE GOES IT'S DAY THREE OF THE MAPLE SYRUP DIET 
I THOUGHT I'D LET YOU HAVE A LOOK AT MY STOMACH SEE HOW IT'S GETTING ON 
YOU CAN SEE WHAT I MEAN BY IT'S GOING A BIT FLATTER EVERY DAY 
MY STOMACH IS DEFINITELY LOOKING FLATTER 
THE RIBS ARE GOING IN MORE THERE BUT THAT'S NATURAL FOR ME 
I HAVE QUITE A CONCAVE UNDER MY RIB CAGE 
BUT BY THE END OF IT IT SHOULD BE A LOT BETTER 
VICTORIA'S ALREADY LOST SIX POUNDS BUT THERE IS A DOWNSIDE TO THIS DIET 
SHE'S FINDING EXERCISE HARD GOING 
I AM QUITE TIRED BUT I'M ALSO GETTING QUITE CONFUSED 
JUST TRYING TO REMEMBER ALL THE MOVES AND THINGS PROPERLY LIKE I'VE GOT A STRENGTH TEST 
I CAN NORMALLY GO FOR TWENTY THIRTY SECONDS I PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO GET FIVE OR TEN RIGHT NOW 
DAY FOUR OF MY DIET AND I'M IN LEEDS WITH PSYCHOLOGIST ANDY HILL 
WHO SPENDS A LOT OF TIME IN SCHOOLS 
TRYING TO WORK OUT WHERE KIDS ATTITUDES TO BODY SHAPE AND DIETING ARE COMING FROM 
SO WHAT'S THE MOST SURPRISING THING THAT YOU'VE FOUND FROM THE RESEARCH YOU'VE BEEN DOING OVER THESE YEARS 
REALLY THE LEVEL OF DIETING THAT'S THERE IN GIRLS AGED NINE TO TEN 
A O. R. SIX IT HAS WITH BODY DISSATISFACTION 
THEY THINK THEY'RE FAT AND THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
I WANT TO TALK TO SOME PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN SO I'M MEETING THIS CLASS OF EIGHT AND NINE YEAR OLDS 
HELLO HELLO 
AREN'T YOU GOOD HOW ARE YOU YOU O. K. YEAH 
THANK YOU FOR LETTING US IN TO HAVE A TALK TO YOU 
I'VE GOT SOME PICTURES HERE 
OUT OF THESE PEOPLE WHICH ONE HAS GOT THE MOST FRIENDS 
HAS HE GOT THE MOST FRIENDS 
HAS HE GOT THE MOST FRIENDS 
WHY DO YOU THINK IT MATTERS WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE TO HOW MANY FRIENDS YOU HAVE 
BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL MAKE FUN OF YOU IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK 
HE LOOKS A BIT OVERWEIGHT AND HE LOOKS LIKE HE NEEDS TO GO ON A DIET 
DOES HE HE NEEDS TO GO ON A DIET HANDS UP WHO THINK HE NEEDS TO GO ON A DIET 
EVERYONE 
WHERE DID YOU FIRST HEAR THE WORD DIET 
AND SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO GO ON A DIET 
AND SHE'S CUT OFF EATING NUTS AND CRISPS 
HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOUR MUM STARTED TALKING TO YOU ABOUT DIETS 
I THINK I WAS ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN YEAH O. K. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR PARENTS THINK ABOUT DIETS 
MY MUM THINKS IT'S REALLY USEFUL 
SHE CAN LOOK REALLY NICE 
AND SHE WON'T LOOK SO FAT 
WHEN SHE GOES TO REALLY POSH PLACES 
SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING COMING UP YOUR MUM'LL GO ON A DIET FOR IT WHO ELSE HAS HEARD THAT 
CAN I ASK YOU WHAT MAGAZINES YOU READ 
LIKE HEAT MAGAZINE OR GRAZIA MAGAZINE OR 
UM THE NEW LOOK ONES 
NEW NOW 
NOW YEAH YEAH 
D'YOU THINK YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT YOUNG TO BE READING THOSE 
IS THERE ANYONE YOU CAN NAME ME SOMEONE FAMOUS 
WHO'S PRETTY OR GOOD LOOKING BOYS OR GIRLS 
VICTORIA BECKHAM VICTORIA BECKHAM YEAH 
DO YOU THINK VICTORIA BECKHAM LOOKS NICE ALL THE TIME YEAH NO 
SHE DOES BUT THEN SHE LOOKS A BIT ANOREXIC WHEN SHE PUTS HER CLOTHES ON 
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK YEAH 
WHO DO YOU THINK IS PRETTY LEONA LEWIS 
HANDS UP WHO THINKS LEONA'S PRETTY 
ALL THE GIRLS AND NONE OF THE BOYS 
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FELT I FOUND IT REALLY REALLY INTERESTING 
AND QUITE ALARMING AT TIMES SOME OF THE INFORMATION YOU'RE GETTING 
JUST SHOWS YOU THAT CHILDREN OF THIS AGE ARE PART OF THE ADULT WORLD 
THEY KNOW THE TERMS THEY KNOW THE ATTITUDES THEY KNOW 
IT'S NOT RIGHT TO BE FAT THEY KNOW ABOUT DIET 
DO YOU THINK IT'S RIGHT THAT PARENTS SHOULD LEAVE THESE MAGAZINES AROUND TO ME THEY SHOULD REALLY 
HAVE A CERTIFICATE ON THEM YES BUT THEY CAN STILL WATCH TELLY AND SEE ALL OF THOSE THINGS 
BUT THEY SHOULDN'T BE WATCHING THINGS LIKE THAT AT NINE AND TEN 
THEY SHOULD BE ALL THESE ISSUE THEY'RE ACTED OUT IN KIDS' DRAMAS 
THEY SEE THEM ON THE STREETS ACTED OUT BY REAL LIFE ADULTS 
SO IF CHILDREN OF EIGHT ARE READING STUFF ABOUT CELEBS GETTING THINNER BY DIETING 
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THAT SOME OF THE MAGAZINES SHOULD AT LEAST CARRY A HEALTH WARNING 
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE EFFECTS OF THE CELEBRITY DIET I'M CURRENTLY ON 
THE MAPLE SYRUP DIET ARE BEGINNING TO WORRY ME 
SORRY I KEEP LOOKING AT THE SCREEN AT THE CAMERA AND THINKING 
I DON'T LOOK VERY WELL I THINK I LOOK QUITE ILL 
AND I'VE GOT SOME SPOTS COMING OUT BUT THAT'S THE DETOXING ERM 
MY SKIN'S QUITE CLEAR MY HAIR'S O. K. ERM 
BUT I THINK YOU KNOW I'M QUITE TIRED 
BAGPIPES PLAY WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE SCOTS THAT MAKES THEM SO TOUGH 
IN ABERDEEN VIKKI'S TELLING ME SHE FEELS GREAT EVEN THOUGH THE TEST 
FOR KETONES IN HER URINE AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF HOW THE BODY'S COPING WITH THE DIET 
REVEAL SHE'S NEARING THE POINT OF STARVATION 
AND MY KETONES WERE REALLY REALLY PURPLE WHICH MEANS I'M USING A LOT OF THEM 
BUT I'M NOT FEELING ANY OTHER SYMPTOMS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REPORTING ON 
SO THERE IS QUITE A NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE I THINK 
TO PASS THE TIME ON THE MAPLE SYRUP DIET I'VE WRITTEN A LIST 
OF ALL THE MIRACLE INGREDIENTS CELEBRITIES ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE STUFFED IN THEIR MOUTHS 
ACCORDING TO THE MAGAZINES MOST OF WHICH YOU CAN BUY HERE 
IT'S REALLY FUNNY ACTUALLY 
BECAUSE SINCE I'VE LOST THE WEIGHT 
PEOPLE ARE PEERING INTO MY TROLLEY AND LOOKING AT WHAT I'VE GOT HAVING A NOSE 
HELLO 
ANOTHER HEADLINE ABOUT ME IN THAT DRESS I WORE TO THE FILM PREMIERE 
I CAN'T STOP MYSELF FROM READING THIS STUFF 
THE WEIGHT'S FALLING OFF CERTAINLY IS THIS WEEK THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT YET 
AND SHE'LL BE TAKING PART IN A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT FAD DIETS FOR B. B. C. FOUR UH UH 
THEY NEVER GET IT QUITE RIGHT 
AH CABBAGES 
TOOTHPASTE 
CHEWING GUM 
BLEACH 
THAT IS A JOKE 
HOW THIS MAKES YOU LOSE WEIGHT IS BEYOND ME 
APPLE CIDER VINEGAR 
IF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING IN MY TROLLEY TODAY 
THEY'LL THINK I'M AN ABSOLUTE LOONEY 
IT'S NOW DAY FIVE OF MY DIET 
AND THESE SHOPPING BAGS ARE SUDDENLY REALLY HEAVY 
I'M MEETING DIETICIAN BECKY STEVENSON AGAIN FOR A DIET CHECK UP 
AND TO GET HER ADVICE ABOUT ALL THE OTHER CELEB DIETS I'VE FOUND 
HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON WITH YOUR DIET 
REALLY YEAH MY CONCENTRATION IS GOING 
I FEEL LIKE MY BRAIN IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY 
YEAH AND I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T STRING PROPER SENTENCES TOGETHER 
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'D IMAGINE YOU'RE LOOKING REALLY TIRED 
DO I LOOK TIRED YEAH YOU DO LOOK TIRED 
INSTEAD OF SUSHI ON THE MENU TODAY 
IS MY COLLECTION OF FAD DIET INGREDIENTS I WANT BECKY TO TELL ME 
IF ANY OF THESE DIETS ARE ANY GOOD 
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND ANY ONE OF THEM AS A DIETICIAN I'D SAY ABSOLUTELY NO WAY NOT RECOMMEND ANY OF THEM 
ANY OF THE ADVICE THAT WE GIVE HAS TO HAVE 
REALLY GOOD SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE 
AND NONE OF THESE DIETS AND ALL THESE DIET AIDS HAVE ANYTHING TO SUPPORT THEM 
MM M. M. 
CAN'T WAIT TO HAVE MY LUNCH 
WHAT IS ALL THAT ABOUT I THINK WHEN PEOPLE ARE EATING THEIR FOOD 
WHAT THEY CAN DO IS GET UP FROM THE TABLE AND BRUSH THEIR TEETH AND IT DISCOURAGES THEM FROM EATING MORE 
THIS DIET DOESN'T CONSIST OF JUST TOOTHPASTE THAT YOU EAT 
I THINK IT'S JUST TO STOP YOU SNACKING YOU'VE HELPED ME OUT 
YEAH THE CABBAGE THE CABBAGE SOUP DIET WHICH WAS A LOT OF YEARS AGO 
WAS VERY POPULAR AND IT CONSISTED OF CABBAGE SOUP 
YOU'RE TAKING OUT ALL THE MAIN FOOD GROUPS YOUR STARCHY CARBOHYDRATES 
YOUR PROTEIN YOUR FATS SURELY THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR YOUR BUM 
I DON'T THINK YOU'D WANNA GO OUT IN PUBLIC IF YOU'VE BEEN EATING LOTS OF CABBAGE SOUP 
I CAN SEE THAT THE MAPLE SYRUP'S COMING ROUND YEAH 
THIS IS THE ONE YOU'VE BEEN TRYING FOR THE LAST SIX DAYS YEAH YEAH 
I'M SO SICK OF THIS TIN YES I'M NOT SURPRISED 
THE AMOUNT OF CALORIES THIS PROVIDES PER DAY IT'S ONLY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY A DAY 
WHICH IS REALLY REALLY DANGEROUS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE BODY 
NEEDS A MINIMUM OF AROUND ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED CALORIES A DAY JUST FOR IT TO NORMALLY FUNCTION 
JUST FOR YOU TO BREATHE THAT'S EVEN JUST LAYING IN BED YEAH 
THIS ONE I LOVE 
BABY FOOD 
SO JUST ONE OF THESE EACH MEAL YEAH THESE FOODS ARE JUST 
TO SUPPLEMENT WHILE YOU'RE WEANING A CHILD SO THEY'RE REALLY LOW 
PEOPLE SERIOUSLY SIT WITH A SPOON AND EAT BABY FOOD YEAH 
CIDER VINEGAR TELL ME ABOUT THAT 
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS USED IN ANCIENT EGYPT 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DRINK THIS BEFORE YOU EAT AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO REDUCE YOUR BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS 
SMELLS LIKE WHITE LIGHTNING THAT I USED TO DRINK IN THE PARK WHEN I WAS YOUNGER 
YES YEAH URGH 
BUT IT'S ACIDIC AND IT'S GONNA IRRITATE YOUR STOMACH IF YOU TAKE THAT 
AGAIN IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT I WOULD WHY DON'T PEOPLE JUST DRINK A BIT OF ACID 
BEFORE THEY START EATING IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE DOES IT 
TWENTY MINUTES INTO THE INTERVIEW AND SUDDENLY I'M NOT FEELING MYSELF 
HOW ARE YOU FEELING HOW AM I FEELING ARE YOU O. K. 
YOU'RE NOT FLAGGING A BIT I'M VERY FLAGGING YEAH 
CAN WE JUST DO ONE THING NO I'M FINE I WANNA CARRY ON I'M GONNA BE LIKE THIS ALL DAY 
THIS WAS ME ON MY WAY TO MY NEXT APPOINTMENT 
IT'S TWO THIRTY IN THE AFTERNOON 
LUCKILY SEA AND SUNSHINE ARE ON THE MENU THIS WEEKEND AS WELL AS MAPLE SYRUP 
WELL HERE I AM 
IN BEAUTIFUL PORTUGAL 
I'M HOPING FOR A NICE RELAXING TIME 
STILL DOING THE DETOX 
ERM IT'S INCREDIBLE 
MY STOMACH AND EVERYTHING IS ERM 
YEAH REALLY PLEASED WITH IT YOU KNOW ERM 
BUT I DON'T REALISE JUST HOW CLOSE TO DANGER I'M PUTTING MY BODY 
OVER DINNER WITH FRIENDS A FEW HOURS LATER 
SOMETHING VERY STRANGE HAPPENED 
I SAT HERE ERM WITH THE GUYS HAVING SOME FOOD 
ERM AND I WAS JUST HAVING WATER 
AND I CAME OVER VERY VERY FUNNY VERY FUNNY ERM 
I COULD FEEL LIKE A PALPITATION IN MY HEART 
SHE JUST LOOKED LIKE DEATH 
ACTUALLY WE TOOK HER PULSE AND IT WAS REALLY REALLY SLOW 
THEN SHE JUST SAID HER HEART WAS RACING AND SHE FELT LIKE SHE WAS GONNA HAVE A HEART ATTACK 
THAT'S IT FOR ME I ACTUALLY FEEL QUITE SCARED BY IT 
ERM YEAH IT'S FREAKED ME OUT A BIT 
SO THE FIRST WARM THING I'VE HAD IN MY MOUTH APART FROM CAMOMILE TEA AND PEPPERMINT 
MM M. M. 
IN JUST UNDER A WEEK ON THE DIET I'VE LOST HALF A STONE 
IN ABERDEEN THE FACT THAT THIS DIET'S BEEN SUPERVISED 
BY OUR DIETICIAN SEEMS TO BE UNSETTLING VIKKI 
HAVING SOMEBODY TELL ME WHEN TO START THE DIET WHAT I COULD EAT AND WHEN TO STOP IT 
AND PEOPLE CHECKING ON ME MADE ME REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE WHEN I'VE DONE A DIET IN THE PAST 
IT'S ALL BEEN ABOUT KEEPING IT TO MYSELF 
AND AFTER LOOKING AT ALL VIKKI'S TEST RESULTS 
THE DIETICIAN TELLS HER TO STOP SHE MADE IT THROUGH SEVEN DAYS AND LOST ELEVEN POUNDS 
VIKKI'S OBVIOUSLY MADE OF STRONGER STUFF THAN ME 
I'M STILL FEELING ABSOLUTELY FINE BUT I HAVE TO STOP BECAUSE 
I PROMISED I WOULD WHEN THE HEALTH EXPERT TOLD ME TO 
I'M ONLY NINE STONE ELEVEN I DO WANT TO GET DOWN A BIT FURTHER 
I WILL KEEP DIETING TO FINISH THE REST OF MY WEIGHT LOSS THAT I WANT TO DO EVEN IF IT'S NOT THIS DIET 
IRONICALLY THE VERY DAY I ENDED MY DIET 
I GOT SNAPPED BY THE PRESS LOOKING THINNER THAN EVER BEFORE I WONDER WHY 
THERE'S SOME SHOTS OF ME IN THE PAPER 
IT SAYS THE REAL SECRET OF SONIA'S AMAZING TRANSFORMATION 
BREATHE IN 
IT'S QUITE FUNNY ACTUALLY COS THESE PICTURES WERE TAKEN 
YOU KNOW FROM THAT AWFUL MAPLE SYRUP DIET WHICH SEEMS ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO THANK GOD 
I THINK I LOOK REALLY TIRED LUCKY I'VE GOT A PAIR OF SUNGLASSES ON 
HAND ON YOUR HIP THERE 
THAT'S IT AND A SMILE BABE 
YES THAT'S NICE FAB 
A FEW DAYS AFTER THE MAPLE SYRUP DIET 
I'M PILING ON ALL THE POUNDS I LOST THAT'S BECAUSE MOST OF THE WEIGHT I'VE LOST 
IS WATER AND ENERGY STORES 
ALSO COS I WAS LITERALLY STARVING MYSELF 
MY BODY'S REACTING BY STORING MORE OF THE FOOD I'M EATING NOW AS FAT 
I WANT TO COMPARE MY EXPERIENCE OF THE MAPLE SYRUP DIET WITH VICTORIA'S ALSO 
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU THE DIETING BUG HASN'T QUITE LEFT MY SYSTEM 
I FEEL LIKE I'VE COME A LONG WAY FROM LAST WEEK 
THIS TIME LAST WEEK DO YOU FEEL A LOT BETTER A LOT HOW ABOUT YOU 
I FEEL A LOT BETTER AS WELL HOW DID YOU FEEL I KNOW WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE 
BUT WE'VE NOT GONE INTO DETAIL ABOUT IT I THINK YOU AND ME GOT VERY DIFFERENT SYMPTOMS 
THE TASTE WAS THE WORST THING FOR ME I FOUND I WAS DRINKING A LOT MORE WATER THAN MAPLE SYRUP 
I'M NOT JOKING 
I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO SCARED IN MY LIFE 
IT REALLY FREAKS YOU OUT I'M NOT SURPRISED HEART PALPITATIONS ARE REALLY SCARY 
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA DIE 
WE'RE LUCKY WE ONLY KNEW THAT COS WE GOT TOLD BY A DIETICIAN THIS IS THE THING 
YOU CAN GO IN A SHOP BUY ALL THE INGREDIENTS AND A BOOK THAT TELLS YOU WHAT TO DO 
I REALLY FIND IT QUITE SCARY 
I DIDN'T THINK 
I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T EATEN IN A WEEK NOT ONCE 
DID YOU FEEL QUITE PROUD OF YOURSELF THOUGH YEAH 
IN A SCARY KIND OF WAY IT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF POWER ABOVE EVERYONE ELSE SATISFACTION 
YEAH IT'S VERY DANGEROUS IT'S FAR TOO EXTREME FOR ME 
FAR TOO EXTREME I NEED TO COME DOWN A LEVEL WHAT'S THE NEXT THING I COULD DO 
ANOTHER DIET THAT I'VE DONE 
WAS THE FOURTEEN MINUTE DIET THE THUMBNAIL DIET IT'S ALSO CALLED YEAH 
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE MORNING THAT YOU'RE GONNA GO OUT YOU PREPARE 
A SANDWICH BAG FULL OF BITS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES ALL THE SIZE OF YOUR THUMBNAIL 
AND THEN YOU SET A REMINDER ON YOUR PHONE FOR EVERY FOURTEEN MINUTES TO GO OFF 
AND EVERY FOURTEEN MINUTES YOU EAT ONE OF THESE TINY PIECES BUT YOU CAN'T SURELY IF YOU'RE AT COLLEGE 
OR DOING YOUR POLE DANCING LESSONS YOU CAN STILL EAT THREE SMALL HEALTHY MEALS A DAY 
I MIGHT TRY THAT ONE TOMORROW 
JUST FOR THE MONOTONY OF IT 
IT'S QUITE FUNNY IF YOU'RE ON A BUS I WAS GONNA SAY WHEN I'M ON THE TUBE 
AND MY BUZZER GOES OFF IT'LL BE IN THE PAPER THE NEXT DAY NAT'S GONE MAD 
CHECK OUT MY NEW PINK NAILS THEY EQUALS RE VERY PORN STAR PINK 
THEY ARE PORNO PINK DEFINITELY VERY GOOD 
SO TOMORROW I'M OFF ON A NEW DIET THE FINGERNAIL DIET 
BUT AM I TRYING TO PROVE TO VICTORIA THEY DON'T WORK 
OR AM I STILL SECRETLY TEMPTED BY FAD DIETS 
YESTERDAY VICTORIA WAS TELLING ME ABOUT THIS FOURTEEN MINUTE DIET 
THE THUMBNAIL DIET 
OR FINGERNAIL 
WHERE YOU PREPARE FOOD THAT'S ONE C. M. X. ONE C. M. ABOUT THE SAME AS YOUR NAIL THUMBNAIL 
AND YOU EAT THAT EVERY FOURTEEN MINUTES 
SO I'VE GOT MY MUSHROOMS AND TOMATOES IN THERE 
AND THEN I'VE GOT SOME RASPBERRIES IN THAT ONE 
I'M GOING TO CARRY THOSE AROUND WITH ME AND PUT ONE IN MY MOUTH EVERY FOURTEEN MINUTES 
O. K. 
FOURTEEN MINUTES 
I AM READY FOR MY NEXT THING AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A MUSHROOM 
I ACTUALLY CAN'T BEAR IT 
WHAT I'VE REALISED AND DIDN'T THINK OF 
IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING EVERY FOURTEEN MINUTES 
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING AND THAT'S EAT 
TIME FOR ANOTHER ONE 
WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP 
AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO STICK SOMETHING IN YOUR MOUTH SO OFTEN 
THIS ISN'T EXACTLY A PRIVATE DIET 
I'VE GOT TO GO IN AND SEE MY SOLICITOR 
WITH A BUNCH OF MUSHROOMS AND TOMATOES 
SHE'S GONNA THINK I'M A LUNATIC 
I'M DOING A REALLY ODD FAD DIET 
WHICH CONSISTS OF ME EATING JUST A MUSHROOM 
EVERY FOURTEEN MINUTES 
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FINGERNAIL THING ALL DAY AND IT'S RIDICULOUS 
IT'S A TOTAL 
POWER THING 
ODD O. C. D. TYPE 
DIET IF YOU WANNA CALL IT THAT 
BUT I GIVE UP 
I GIVE UP BECAUSE I'VE GOT A LIFE 
END OF STORY THANKS 
I'M STARTING TO THINK THAT MAYBE CELEBS HAVEN'T DONE ANY OF THESE DIETS AT ALL 
SO I THOUGHT I'D SPEND HALF AN HOUR 
CHECKING WITH THEIR AGENTS AND PUBLICISTS 
WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT WHO'S DONE WHAT 
OH HELLO THERE I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD SPEAK TO VICTORIA BECKHAM'S AGENT PLEASE O. K. 
I'M DOING THIS DOCUMENTARY ABOUT FAD DIETS RIGHT AND I WAS READING ONE ABOUT VICTORIA BECKHAM 
ABOUT ACAI BERRIES AND THAT SHE JUST DRINKS THAT AND EATS THOSE 
I WAS READING AN ARTICLE ABOUT SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR SAYING THAT 
SHE DID THE CABBAGE SOUP DIET 
HELLO COULD I SPEAK TO BEYONCE KNOWLES' AGENT PLEASE 
YES I'VE GOT A QUESTION ABOUT MADONNA'S DIET 
I'VE BEEN READING AN ARTICLE ABOUT JENNIFER ANISTON 
SAYING THAT SHE DID THE ATKINS DIET 
COULD I GET YOU TO EMAIL ME 
O. K. I'M PHONING SAMANTHA MUMBA'S AGENT 
BECAUSE APPARENTLY SHE EATS LOADS AND LOADS OF PIES 
PIES 
I'M PHONING J. LO'S AGENT 
BECAUSE APPARENTLY 
SHE DOES THE S. M. 
THE SMALL PORTION DIET 
AFTER THE BOREDOM OF THE FINGERNAIL DIET 
WHICH I STUCK TO FOR JUST TEN HOURS 
MY TEMPTATION TO DIET IS FRANKLY LESS THAN IT WAS 
SO NOW I'M DEFINITELY OUT TO PROVE THAT THE GLAMOUR OF CELEB DIETING 
AND THE REALITY OF CELEB DIETING ARE TWO SEPARATE THINGS 
MY NEXT DIET I HOPE WILL PROVE THAT 
IT CONSISTS OF CABBAGE CABBAGE 
AND MORE CABBAGE 
LOOK AT ALL THIS LOVELY CHEESE AND PATE 
AND FOOD 
AND I'M GONNA BE SITTING EATING CABBAGES FOR A WEEK 
OH 
EXCUSE ME HELLO CAN I HELP YOU 
HIYA I'M NATALIE HELLO NATALIE NICE TO MEET YOU 
SOUNDS A BIT MAD 
BUT I'M GOING ON A CABBAGE SOUP DIET 
AND WONDERED IF YOU COULD HELP ME BECAUSE I DON'T WANNA GET BORED OF THE SAME OLD CABBAGES 
ERM THE SAVOY IS A NICE CABBAGE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR 
RED CABBAGE O. K. 
GOT NOT SPACE LEFT I'M CABBAGED OUT 
I'VE READ THAT SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR HAS DONE THE CABBAGE SOUP DIET 
IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR SARAH IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME 
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER 
AND OVER 
YOU BECOME QUITE OBSESSED WITH IT 
AND YOU DO WORRY WHEN YOU'RE ON A FAD DIET AND YOU COME OFF 
THERE IS A SENSE OF PANIC 
WHERE YOU THINK WHAT AM I GONNA EAT NOW 
WHAT DO I EAT 
I'D HEARD ENOUGH ABOUT THIS DIET TO REALISE THAT EMERGENCY PRECAUTIONS MAY BE REQUIRED 
QUITE BLAND 
I THINK THE WORST THING ABOUT IT WILL PROBABLY BE THE EMBARRASSMENT 
OF BREAKING WIND IN PUBLIC 
AND I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF DOING THAT IN FRONT OF MY BOYFRIEND TO BE HONEST 
IT'S JUST NOT VERY SEXY IS IT 
SO FAR ON THIS FILM I'VE DISCOVERED THAT NEWSPAPERS AND WEEKLY MAGAZINES 
REGULARLY PRINT DETAILS OF DIETS WHICH DIETICIANS WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND 
AND WORRYINGLY THAT CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS EIGHT ARE READING THIS STUFF 
SO WHILST IN THE PAST THE TABLOIDS HAVE SNAPPED ME IN MY WORLD 
TODAY I THOUGHT I'D TURN UP ON THEIR DOORSTEP INSTEAD 
TO TALK ABOUT THESE DIETS 
KEVIN O'SULLIVAN FROM THE SUNDAY MIRROR 
HAS BEEN IN THE SHOWBIZ GOSSIP GAME FOR NEARLY THIRTY YEARS 
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT MAGAZINES AND PAPERS OVER THE LAST FIVE WEEKS 
IN GREAT DEPTH AND EVERY OTHER PAGE IS ABOUT A CELEBRITY 
ON A CERTAIN STUPID DIET 
WHERE DO THE DIETS COME FROM 
WHY DO WE KNOW THAT POSH ONLY EATS PRAWNS 
IF IT WAS IN THE PAPER TOMORROW 
AT LAST THE SECRET OF WHY POSH IS SO THIN WOULD YOU READ IT 
OF COURSE OF COURSE YOU WOULD SO WHEN SOMEONE LIKE BEYONCE 
WHO I THINK MENTIONED IN AN OFF HAND KIND OF WAY IN AN INTERVIEW 
YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK I'M LOOKING A BIT THINNER IT'S BECAUSE I'M USING THIS MAPLE SYRUP DIET 
YEAH THEN THAT BECOMES BEYONCE'S AMAZING MAPLE SYRUP DIET 
HOW TO GET THIN LIKE BEYONCE 
I THINK YOU A CELEBRITY ME A SHOWBUSINESS JOURNALIST 
HEAT MAGAZINE THE SUNDAY MIRROR NEWS OF THE WORLD WE'RE ALL IN IT 
WE'RE ALL SWIRLING AROUND IN THIS VORTEX 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME BECAUSE I'VE DONE THE FITNESS D. V. D. 
I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING WHAT YOU DID YOU'RE NOT 
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING LIKE SOME SORT OF EMACIATED SKELETON 
THIS IS THE REAL DANGER THIS IS THE REAL DARK SIDE 
IS WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE LIKE NICOLE RICHIE 
RENEE ZELLWEGER ALL THESE PEOPLE JENNIFER ANISTON'S HAD HER MOMENTS 
AND ONE LAST SORT OF ELEMENT TO THIS IS THEY'RE ACTUALLY REALLY 
A SORT OF PRETTY DIM STAR WHO GETS SUCKED INTO IT AS WELL 
AND SOMEHOW THEY THINK BLIMEY IF I GET LIKE NICOLE RICHIE 
I CAN BE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF HEAT AND THAT'LL GET ME A JOB IN HOLLYOAKS NEXT WEEK 
SO THAT'S THE OTHER PART OF THIS ETERNAL VICIOUS CIRCLE 
HOW ABOUT THE HYPOCRISY OF IT ALL WHEN YOU'VE GOT FOR INSTANCE 
NO TO FAT CELEBS AND THEY'VE GOT THE CIRCLES OR THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR FAT BUMS 
OR LOOKING AT THE CELLULITE AND THEN A WEEK AFTER IT'S ALL STARS ARE TOO SKINNY 
I MEAN HOW DO WE WIN I'M HESITANT TO BLAME THE PAPERS AND MAGAZINES 
I'M NOT FOR THIS OBSESSION WITH PEOPLE'S WEIGHT 
I THINK WE ARE OBSESSED WITH OUR WEIGHT EVERYONE IS 
DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANY GUILT IN THIS OFFICE 
ME WALKING INTO THIS OFFICE TODAY IS REALLY WEIRD BECAUSE YOU KNOW 
FOR ME IT'S LIKE YOU'RE IN THE LION'S DEN I MEAN LOOK AT THIS EXAMPLE RIGHT 
THE OTHER WEEK YOU COULDN'T HELP HAVING A LITTLE POP 
BREATHE IN 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
I WASN'T JUST I'M ON THE BEACH WHATEVER IT'S BREATHE IN 
YOU CAN'T WIN YEAH IT IS A BIT UNFAIR 
YOU'RE LOOKING PRETTY GOOD IF YOU ASK ME THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WASN'T EVEN BREATHING IN 
IF I SAY GOODBYE NOW AND SAY OH LOVELY TO SEE YOU 
AND I GO AWAY AND EAT A LOAD OF PIES RIGHT 
AND I SIT ON A BEACH SOMEWHERE AND YOU'VE GOT A PIC 
HOW MUCH OF A STORY WOULD THAT BE IT'S THE STORY WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR 
IT'S TRUE THOUGH NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT YOU 
BUT IT'S THE STORY ISN'T IT YOU KNOW FOR US 
IT IS 
IT'S THE BEST STORY AFTER THE DIET 
WELL IF I WANT TO BE ON KEVIN'S FRONT PAGES 
I NOW KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO 
BUT DESPITE ME BEING ON THE COVERS OF THE WEEKLY MAGAZINES ALL THE TIME 
THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW THEY REPORT DIETS 
AND HOW YOUNG THEIR READERS REALLY ARE 
SEVENTEEN PER CENT OF NOW'S READERS ARE EIGHTEEN OR UNDER 
BUT THEY REFUSED TO TAKE PART SAYING THEY DON'T TARGET THEM 
A QUARTER OF MORE'S READERS ARE EIGHTEEN OR UNDER 
THEY WOULDN'T TAKE PART EITHER FOR THE SAME REASON 
LOOK MAGAZINE SAID NO REVEAL WOULDN'T REVEAL ANYTHING 
AND I COULD ONLY GET CLOSE TO CLOSER IF I PROMISED TO PAINT THE MAGAZINE IN A POSITIVE LIGHT 
NO SURPRISE THAT ONE OF THE FEW MAGAZINES THAT WOULD TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS IS TEEN MAGAZINE SUGAR 
WHO UNLIKE THE REST HAVE COMPLETELY BANNED DIETING FROM THEIR MAG 
THE ONE BELOW SHE'S SMILING 
EDITOR ANNABEL BROG EXPLAINS WHY 
WE AVOID IT BECAUSE I THINK 
THE CONTINUOUS DIALOGUE ABOUT IT 
JUST MAKES PEOPLE CONCENTRATE ON IT YEAH 
I THINK IT'S LIKE THE URBAN MYTH I DON'T KNOW IF IT EVER HAPPENED 
THE RADIO D. J. THAT WENT DON'T LICK THE LAMP POST KIDS IT'S FREEZING 
AND OF COURSE ALL THESE KIDS WHO HAVE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT GO AND LICK LAMP POSTS 
AND I THINK IT'S THE SAME 
IF YOU'RE CONSTANTLY INVOLVED IN A DIALOGUE ABOUT WHAT'S TOO THIN 
WHAT'S TOO FAT WHAT LOOKS NICE 
IT IS A MASSIVE ANXIETY FOR TEENAGE GIRLS I'M SAD ABOUT THAT 
BUT REALISTICALLY I KNOW IT IS SOMETHING THEY WORRY ABOUT 
SO WHAT SUGAR TRIES TO DO IS JUST NOT ENGAGE IN IT PARTICULARLY 
WHEN TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN YOU KNOW YOUR READERS 
WRITE TO YOU ABOUT DIETING 
AND THE INSECURITIES THEY HAVE ABOUT THEIR WEIGHT 
HOW MANY OF THEM DO YOU THINK ARE ACTUALLY INTO DIETING 
I WOULD SAY OVER NINETY PER CENT HAVE BEEN ON A DIET 
FAD DIETS FAD D. I. E. T. S. THIRTY PER CENT 
DEFINITELY MOST GIRLS BY THE AGE OF FOURTEEN HAVE TRIED A DIET 
DO YOU THINK IT WILL GET BIGGER 
THE WHOLE SUPER SKINNY THING THE WHOLE FAD DIETING THING 
MAKING UP DIETS IN MAGAZINES 
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY REACHED SATURATION POINT 
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL STAY AT SATURATION POINT YEAH 
BUT I THINK THE BUBBLE WILL BURST 
I THINK THE FIRST TIME A MAGAZINE WENT SUPER SKINNY CELEBS 
OR WOBBLY CELEBS 
IT WAS KIND OF OH MY GOD CAR CRASH READING MUST LOOK AT THAT 
BUT YOU KNOW IS THE PUBLIC BORED OF IT I THINK POSSIBLY 
REALLY GETTING THERE I HOPE SO 
I'M AFRAID I'VE GOT TO DISAGREE 
AND I THINK EVERYONE'S OBSESSED BY IT DO YOU 
I STILL THINK PEOPLE LOVE TO READ ABOUT IT 
BUT ANYTHING GETS A BIT BORING AFTER A WHILE AND IT'S BEEN A WHILE 
TELL ME ABOUT IT IT'S DAY TWO OF THE CABBAGE SOUP DIET 
ER BOYFRIEND DID HAVE A COMMENT TO SAY 
YES I SMELLED THE REMINISCES OF YOUR DIET LAST NIGHT 
SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT I WAS UP TO IN THE NIGHT WHICH IS REALLY EMBARRASSING AND HORRIBLE 
I'M JUST GETTING REALLY BORED OF IT ALREADY 
AND REALLY REALLY KEEP FARTING A LOT 
AND I'M A BIT WORRIED 
I'M SO BORED OF THIS DIET 
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO 
I'M SO BORED OF CABBAGE 
AND I NEED ANOTHER POO 
A FEW DAYS AFTER CALLING THE CELEBRITY AGENTS 
I CAN NOW REVEAL THE DIET SECRETS 
OF THESE CELEBRITIES ACCORDING TO THEM NOT THE MAGAZINES 
MADONNA DOESN'T DO MACROBIOTICS 
JENNIFER ANISTON HAS NEVER USED THE ATKINS DIET 
VICTORIA BECKHAM DOESN'T DO FADDY DIETS AT ALL 
THERE'S NO COMMENT FROM BEYONCE AND J. LO 
BUT SAMANTHA MUMBA LOVES EATING PIES 
SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR HASN'T DONE THE CABBAGE SOUP DIET 
WHICH MAKES ME FEEL A BIT SICK COS I'VE BEEN ON IT FOR THREE DAYS 
AND BEING A CELEBRITY ON A DIET ISN'T EASY 
FIRST YOUR FAVOURITE RESTAURANT FOOD IS OUT OF BOUNDS 
HOW ARE YOU YOU SMELL REALLY LOVELY WHAT IS THAT 
THEN EVEN HUGGING YOUR FANS BECOMES A PAIN IN THE BUM 
I MEAN THAT WAS A BIT EMBARRASSING TO BE HONEST 
SHE WAS HUGGING ME AND I THOUGHT I MIGHT BREAK WIND ANY MINUTE AND KNOCK THE POOR GIRL OUT 
THIS IS RIDICULOUS 
WELL I HAVE HAD A BIT OF A NIGHTMARE 
WITH THE WHOLE CABBAGE SOUP THING 
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW RIDICULOUS THIS SOUNDS BUT THE TOILET HAS BROKEN 
NOT DOWN TO ME BUT IT'S BROKEN 
SO IT'S NOT FLUSHING PROPERLY SO I'VE BEEN IN A PANIC 
AND I'VE DECIDED TO END THE CABBAGE SOUP DIET 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD DIET TO BE ON IF YOUR LOO DOESN'T WORK 
THIS WON'T PLEASE THE PLUMBER WHEN HE FINALLY GETS HERE 
BYE BYE CABBAGE 
WELL I'VE NOW SURVIVED THREE FAD DIETS AND I'M STILL THE WEIGHT I WAS WHEN I BEGAN 
BUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO MY WEIGHT IF I DID THESE TEMPTING DIETS 
FOR MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS 
HARD FACTS ABOUT THIS ARE DIFFICULT TO COME BY 
SO WHEN I HEAR THAT ONE OF AMERICA'S LEADING DIETICIANS 
DIANNE NEUMARK SZTAINER IS VISITING LONDON I ARRANGE A BIT OF A WELCOMING PARTY FOR HER 
THIS IS A NORTH LONDON BUZZY SCHOOL 
HOW DIFFERENT IS THIS FROM A U. S. SCHOOL 
YEAH 
I WOULD SAY THIS IS PRETTY TYPICAL TO AN URBAN SCHOOL IN THE UNITED STATES 
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY A BIG HIT HERE 
DIANNE SPENT OVER FIVE YEARS IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS 
IN THAT TIME SHE'S MONITORED THOUSANDS OF GIRLS AND WHAT THEY EAT 
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR WORK AND WHAT YOU'VE FOUND OUT OVER THE YEARS 
IN OUR STUDY PROJECT EAT 
WHICH IS ONE OF THE LARGEST STUDIES ON THE TOPIC OF EATING 
AND WEIGHT IN TEENAGERS WE FOUND THAT TEENAGERS WHO WENT ON DIETS 
WERE AT TWICE THE RISK FOR BEING OVERWEIGHT FIVE YEARS LATER 
NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE HEAVIER AT THE BEGINNING 
BECAUSE WE TOOK THAT INTO ACCOUNT IN OUR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
IN ADDITION WE FOUND FIFTY SEVEN PER CENT OF ALL GIRLS ARE NOT ONLY DIETING 
THEY'RE USING UNHEALTHY WEIGHT CONTROL BEHAVIOURS 
INCLUDING SKIPPING MEALS SMOKING CIGARETTES FOR WEIGHT LOSS 
TAKING DIET PILLS THINGS OF THAT NATURE 
THAT INFORMATION IS ABSOLUTELY WHAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE TOLD 
THAT SHOULD BE ON BILLBOARDS IT SHOULD BE ON AN ADVERT ON T. V. 
THAT DIETING MAKES YOU FATTER 
I THINK IT SHOULD BE TAKEN AS SERIOUSLY AS DRUG ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM GAMBLING 
I'VE DONE IT I'VE FAD DIETED AND GONE BACK AND PUT MORE WEIGHT ON 
AND MORE WEIGHT ON AND MORE WEIGHT ON 
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE SHOULD YOUNG PEOPLE BE GOING ON THESE DIETS 
NO YOU KNOW I SUSPECT FROM THE PEOPLE I'VE SPOKEN TO THAT NORMAL HEALTHY LIFESTYLE IS BORING 
THEY WANT A QUICK FIX THEY WANT TO GET INTO THAT DRESS BY FRIDAY 
THEY WANT TO RIP SOMETHING OUT OF A MAGAZINE AND FOLLOW IT 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT 
I THINK THE WAY THAT WE'D LIKE TO RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE TO EAT 
AND TO LIVE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE LIFESTYLES 
IS NOT WHAT SELLS MAGAZINES 
YOU KNOW WHAT I HOPE 
I HOPE WE ALL PUT IT OUT THERE THAT DIETING MAKES YOU FAT 
AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN CHANGE SOMETHING 
NO WONDER I GOT BIGGER DURING MY TEENAGE YEARS 
FROM WHAT DIANNE JUST TOLD ME IT'S POSSIBLE IT WASN'T JUST THE EATING 
IT WAS ALL THE DIETING TOO 
I WANT TO SEE WHAT EFFECT YEARS OF FAD DIETING WOULD HAVE ON A FIT HEALTHY BODY LIKE MINE 
AND I KNOW JUST THE PLACE TO START 
I'VE FOUND PAT BUTCHER'S WARDROBE 
ACCORDING TO DIANNE'S RESEARCH I NEED A NEW OUTFIT 
OVER FIVE YEARS OF FAD DIETS MY DRESS SIZE WOULD GRADUALLY GO UP 
FROM A SIZE EIGHT TO TEN 
THIS IS INCREDIBLE 
REALLY WEIRD TO GO BACK TO THIS SHAPE 
IT'S JUST THE STRANGEST FEELING 
I'M NEARLY A STONE AND TWO DRESS SIZES HEAVIER 
IT'S SUCH A SONIA OUTFIT AS WELL 
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT SONIA WOULD HAVE WORN 
I'M GOING OUT 
MY BUM HASN'T BEEN THIS BIG IN TWO YEARS 
THE PAPARAZZI WOULD LOVE IT 
BUT IT'S A SATURDAY AND I KNOW THEY DON'T LIKE WORKING WEEKENDS' 
I'M NOT GOING MAD 
JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU THIS IS WHAT I LOOK LIKE IN REAL LIFE 
WHEN I SAW THE PICTURE I SAID NO THAT'S NOT YOU 
BUT THAT IS ME 
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE 
BUT THAT IS ME 
I THOUGHT THAT LOOKED A BIT FAKE YOU KNOW 
I'VE GOT A FAT SUIT ON 
OH MY GOD 
ARE YOU SERIOUS 
SERIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT REAL 
OH MY GOD THEY'RE NOT 
FEEL IT 
FEEL IT 
I'M WEARING IT COS I'M PROVING A POINT 
IF I WERE TO FAD DIET FOR FIVE YEARS 
STARTING OFF AT THIS SIZE 
I WOULD END UP LOOKING LIKE THIS 
SO FAD DIETING MAKES YOU FATTER 
IS IT 
DOES THAT SHOCK YOU 
YEAH 
DOES THAT SHOCK YOU YEAH 
WHY 
BECAUSE IF YOU GO ON A DIET YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LOSE WEIGHT 
SO HOW DID YOU LOSE EVERYTHING AND LOOK LIKE THAT 
HOW DID I 
THROUGH HEALTHY EATING EXERCISE 
NOTHING DODGY NOTHING 
I CROSS MY HEART THAT'S AMAZING 
I'M GLAD I COULD GET MY MESSAGE OUT TODAY 
I'M NOT TELLING ANYONE WHAT TO DO 
BUT I WILL SAY ONE THING 
THIS EXTRA PADDING HAS PUT ME OFF FAD DIETS FOR GOOD 
SO THAT'S THE LAST YOU'LL SEE OF THIS BUM 
IF I COULD CHEAT 
I WOULD SKIP TO THE END 
DECIDE IF IT'S WORTH GOING THROUGH WITH
