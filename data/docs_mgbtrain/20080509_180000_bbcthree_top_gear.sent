HELLO GOOD EVENING 
THANKS VERY MUCH 
NOW EVER SINCE HONDA DROPPED THE N. S. X. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO 
THE PORSCHE NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN WAS THE ONLY SUPERCAR IF YOU CAN CALL IT A SUPERCAR WHICH YOU CAN 
WAS THE ONLY SUPERCAR THAT YOU COULD USE EVERY DAY 
AND IT STILL IS 
NO IT ISN'T COS NOW THERE'S A NEW KID ON THE BLOCK NO THERE ISN'T 
AUDIS ARE MAINLY BUILT FOR GERMAN CEMENT SALESMEN 
NOT THIS ONE THOUGH 
THIS IS THE R. EIGHT 
IT'S MADE FROM A BLEND OF CARBON FIBRE MAGNESIUM AND ALUMINIUM 
IT HAS TWO SEATS 
THE ENGINE'S IN THE MIDDLE 
AND IT'S ABOUT AS HIGH OFF THE GROUND AS A BADGER'S BADGER 
BY ANY MEASURE IT'S A FULL ON SUPERCAR BUT SO FAR AS I CAN TELL 
IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY OF THE USUAL SUPERCAR DRAWBACKS 
YOU CAN SEE OUT OF IT 
FOR A KICK OFF 
AND IT'S NOT POWERED BY SOME V. SEVENTEEN QUAD TURBO 
THAT DOES HALF A MILE TO THE GALLON AND RUNS ON DICED LIONS 
IT'S ACTUALLY GOT THE SAME FOR FORTY TWO LITRE V. EIGHT THAT AUDI PUT IN THE R. S. FOUR SALOON 
AND WOULD YOU LISTEN TO IT 
I AM NOW DOING ONE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR AND IT SOUNDS LIKE I'M IN CHURCH 
ONLY I'VE GOT MORE HEADROOM 
AND HOW HAVE THEY DONE THAT 
HOW CAN THERE BE SO MUCH SPACE IN A CAR THAT'S SO LOW 
HOW 
I CAN ONLY PRESUME AND THIS IS A REVOLTING THOUGHT I KNOW THAT MY BUTTOCKS ARE 
ACTUALLY KISSING THE CAT'S EYES 
NOT ONLY IS IT SPACIOUS BUT IT'S COMFORTABLE AS WELL 
AND AT SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND IT COSTS ABOUT HALF AS MUCH AS ITS STEPSISTER THE LAMBORGHINI GALLARDO 
IT ALL SOUNDS BRILLIANT 
BUT THERE ARE ONE OR TWO ISSUES THAT ARE WORTH MENTIONING 
MOST THINGS ON IT LEATHER UPHOLSTERY SATELLITE NAVIGATION STAINLESS STEEL PEDALS 
THE STEREO IN FACT NEARLY EVERYTHING IS AN OPTIONAL EXTRA 
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S A PARTICULARLY GOOD LOOKING CAR 
IT'S NOT BALANCED PROPERLY SOMEHOW 
AND THOSE LED FAIRY LAMPS AT THE FRONT REALLY DON'T WORK AT ALL 
THEY MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A COUNCIL HOUSE AT CHRISTMAS 
THE THING IS THOUGH 
YOU WON'T CARE ABOUT THE HEADLAMPS WHEN YOU OPEN THE TAPS A LITTLE BIT 
ZERO TO SIXTY TAKES FORTY SIX SECONDS 
THE TOP SPEED IS AS NEAR AS MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONE HUNDRED NINETY 
IT'S NOT THE SPEED THOUGH 
THAT IMPRESSES YOU MOST OF ALL 
IT'S THE WAY THIS THING FEELS THROUGH THE CORNERS 
DRIVING MOST SUPERCARS IS LIKE TRYING TO MANHANDLE A COW 
UP A BACK STAIRCASE 
THIS IS LIKE SMEARING HONEY INTO KIERA KNIGHTLEY 
IT MAY HAVE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE BUT IT NEVER SENDS MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE POWER TO THE FRONT WHEELS 
YOU DON'T REALLY EVER GET ANY UNDERSTEER 
AND IF IT DOES LET GO IT'S JUST SO MANAGEABLE 
I'M UM I'M COMPLETELY SOLD 
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THIS CAR IS ALMOST WITHOUT FAULT 
IT IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
RUBBISH I'LL SHOW YOU STUNNING 
THIS IS THE BEST NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN THE CARRERA TWO S. 
IT COSTS ABOUT THE SAME AS THE AUDI AND WILL NOW RUN FOUR RINGS ROUND IT 
AH RICHARD HAMMOND APPEARS TO HAVE JOINED US IN HIS VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE YOU WANNA PLAY RIGHT 
SMALL SUSPENSION ON 
TRACTION CONTROL OFF 
HERE GOES 
THE THING IS WITH THAT AUDI YOU'RE JUST NOT AS INVOLVED IN THE DRIVE 
IT'S LIKE HE'S BACK AT BASE PUSHING PLASTIC PIECES AROUND ON 
A TABLE AND IN THIS I'M IN THE FRONT LINE GETTING STUCK IN 
HE'S PROBABLY RABBITING ON IN THERE ABOUT HOW HE FEELS AN ORGANIC PART OF THE MACHINE 
BUT THE SIMPLE FACT IS HE'S BEHIND ME 
OBVIOUSLY THROUGH THE CORNERS I HAVE THE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE GRIP 
AND THEN ON THE STRAIGHTS HIS MISERABLE FLAT SIX IS NO MATCH FOR THIS V. EIGHT TOWER OF POWER 
HOLD ON I THINK HIS ENGINE'S BROKEN I CAN'T HEAR IT 
IT'S ALMOST SILENT WHAT'S THE POINT OF HAVING A SUPERCAR THAT DOESN'T SHOUT ABOUT IT 
MY DRIVING LETTING US DOWN THERE 
MIND YOU HAMMOND'S DRIVING ALSO LETTING HIM DOWN 
FEARING THAT THIS WOULD END UP IN A CRASH AND A FIREBALL WE PULLED OVER FOR AN ARGUMENT 
NOW COME ON NO AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE RESULT 
IT'S ABOUT THE SENSATION ALONG THE WAY 
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS MATE IS THEY PUT THE ENGINE IN THE BACK O. K. 
WRONG PLACE NO 
HORSE AND CART I KNOW LET'S PUT THE HORSE AT THE BACK 
SO IN YOUR CASE THEY PUT THE HORSE IN THE MIDDLE IN THE CART YES BUT IT'S BALANCED 
NO THAT IS ONE OF THE DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS OF THAT CAR WHAT 
WELL IT DEFINES THE SHAPE WHICH IS INCREDIBLY AERODYNAMIC 
AND THE PACKAGING MEANS WITH THE ENGINE BEHIND THE REAR WHEELS YOU'VE GOT ROOM FOR ANOTHER SET OF SEATS 
WHY DO YOU WANT SEATS IN THE BACK 
I TOOK THE KIDS TO SCHOOL IN THAT THIS MORNING AND DROVE STRAIGHT HERE 
WELL I DIDN'T SO WHO'S THE DADDY NOW 
I SAID KIDS YOU'LL HAVE TO GO WITH YOUR MOTHER COS I'VE GOT NO SEATS HE'S GOT SILLY GREY BITS 
HAVING RESOLVED NOTHING WE DECIDED TO SETTLE IT INTELLIGENTLY 
WITH A HALF MILE DRAG RACE 
WELL I'VE GOT ABOUT SEVENTY BRAKE HORSEPOWER LESS BUT IT'S LIGHTER 
HIS FOUR WHEEL DRIVE WILL BOG DOWN OFF THE LINE 
I REALLY WANT TO WIN THIS COS 
I REALLY REALLY LIKE THIS CAR 
I MEAN A LOT 
I'VE GOT THE ENGINE ON THE REAR WHEELS SO I'VE GOT THE ADVANTAGE IN TRACTION 
I AM AHEAD CLEARLY 
HE'S DEFINITELY GOT BETTER TRACTION OFF THE LINE 
CAN'T SEE HIM WHERE IS HE 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY HERE WE GO 
OH NO OH NO 
COME ON COME ON COME ON 
WHO WON 
I'VE NO IDEA 
AHA 
NOW NOW 
I DON'T KNOW NEITHER DO I BUT WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT CAN WE SEE A SLOW MOTION REPLAY 
OF THAT FINISH PLEASE HERE WE GO 
OH YES 
CLEARLY NO NO 
NO 
OH NO NO YOU LOST THAT IS AN L. FOR LOSER 
BUT VERY SOON THERE'S GONNA BE A V. TEN VERSION OF THIS 
NOT THE LAMBO V. TEN AUDI'S OWN 
THEN A HA I WOULDN'T HOLD YOUR BREATH WHY 
DID YOU HEAR WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PROTOTYPE WE HAVE A PHOTOGRAPH OF IT HERE 
THAT'S ON FIRE 
IT'S JUST STEAM REALLY YES 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED ONCE THEY'D PUT THE STEAM OUT YEAH 
THERE'S THE CAR AFTER THEY PUT THE STEAM OUT OH THAT'S STEAMED ISN'T IT IT'S STEAMED YES 
WELL STEAMED CAN WE GET ON NO I'M GOING TO SETTLE THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL I'LL PUT IT TO THE AUDIENCE 
I'M GONNA HOLD A GENERAL ELECTION RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW 
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA THIS IS A VERY POPULAR CAR 
THERE'S A THIRTY THOUSAND PREMIUM ON THESE YOU GO AHEAD IF YOU WANT 
ACTUALLY NO I'VE SUDDENLY DECIDED THAT A GENERAL ELECTION RIGHT NOW IS A STUPID IDEA BECAUSE I MIGHT LOSE 
WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAY WHERE YOU ARE AND NICK ALL MY IDEAS 
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA IN FACT IT WAS MY IDEA TO DO JUST THAT 
BRILLIANT CAR I'VE SAID THAT FROM THE START 
WE MUST NOW FIND OUT HOW FAST THIS GOES ROUND OUR TRACK 
AND THAT MEANS HANDING IT OVER TO OUR TAME RACING DRIVER 
SOME SAY THAT HE'S BANNED FROM THE TOWN OF CHICHESTER 
AND THAT IN A RECENT LATE NIGHT DEAL 
HE BOUGHT A SLIGHTLY DENTED WHITE FIAT UNO FROM THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH 
ALL WE KNOW IS HE'S CALLED THE STIG 
AND HE'S OFF THE TRACK IS LOOKING A BIT DAMP TODAY 
I HOPE THAT WON'T HURT THE TIME AS HE POWERS DOWN TO THE FIRST CORNER 
LIGHTS TWINKLING LIKE A WOOLWORTH'S SALE VERY SMOOTH VERY FLAT LOVELY 
REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS IN CONTROL 
NO FEELINGS OF TENSION IRRITABILITY 
STIG SEEMS TO HAVE GOT HIMSELF SOME SELF HELP C. D.'S AS HE FLICKS IT BEAUTIFULLY THROUGH CHICAGO CHASSIS 
SUBLIME LET'S SEE HOW IT COPES WITH HAMMERHEAD 
SLOW IN THEN BACK ON THE POWER 
NO REAL DRAMA AT ALL 
IN THESE CONDITIONS IT'S JUST EXCELLENT 
BE AWARE ONLY OF YOURSELF AND HAVE NO CONCERN FOR THE THOUGHTS OR EXPECTATIONS OF YOUR PARTNER 
STRAIGHT THROUGH THE FOLLOW THROUGH NO PROBLEM THERE 
SAME ENGINE AS THE MAGNIFICENT R. S. FOUR 
SO MUCH MORE NIMBLE DANCES THROUGH THE TYRE WALL TWO CORNERS LEFT 
STAYING LEVEL AND FOCUSED THERE ISN'T A SINGLE MOMENT'S DRAMA IN IT 
THE APEX AND THERE HE IS ACROSS THE LINE 
EARLIER TODAY 
THE STIG O. K. HE TOOK THE PORSCHE ROUND SO THEY COULD GET A TIME FOR THAT 
WE HAVE SOME FOOTAGE OF IT COMING UP TO THE SECOND TO LAST CORNER 
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THIS RICHARD VERY GOOD VERY GOOD 
STRONG STUFF AS I'D EXPECT AH 
NO WELL IT'S MY IDEA TO SAY AS I'VE ALWAYS SAID 
THE ENGINE IS IN THE WRONG PLACE IN A PORSCHE AND THAT WAS 
IT WAS NEVER MY IDEA THAT YOU'D STOLEN THAT IT WASN'T 
WELL HE DID IT IN ONE MINUTE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO SECONDS 
THEN HE WENT OUT IN THE AUDI 
ONE MINUTE TWO HUNDRED FORTY FOUR SECONDS 
I PREDICTED THAT FROM THE START OBVIOUSLY 
WILL YOU NOW ADMIT THAT THAT IS A BETTER CAR 
YES YES 
YEAH YEAH I KNOW 
AND NOW THE NEWS 
I'M AFRAID WE BEGIN WITH AN APOLOGY 
WE ARE UNABLE TO BRING YOU JEREMY'S ROAD TEST OF A FERRARI ON THE MOON 
UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE HAD A CALL FROM THE B. B. C. DIRECTOR GENERAL 
HE SAID HE HAD ONE OR TWO ISSUES WITH IT 
I THINK IT WAS THE BIT AT THE END WHEN THE QUEEN STORMED OFF THE MOON 
NO ACTUALLY THE QUEEN WALKED ON TO THE MOON NO SHE STORMED OFF IT 
IT WASN'T FAKED IN ANY WAY WE DON'T FAKE THINGS HEY NOW 
MCLAREN ARE WORKING ON A NEW SUPERCAR 
GIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENED IN FORMULA ONE THIS YEAR WE'VE SPECULATED ON WHAT THAT WILL LOOK LIKE 
YES YES 
THAT'S A FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY SCUDERIA IT IS 
THAT'S A NEW VERSION OF THE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY AND IT'S LIGHTER THAN THE STANDARD CAR 
BIT FASTER IT HAS A FLOPPY PADDLE GEAR BOX ON IT BUT IT CHANGES GEAR EVEN FASTER 
THAT'S GREAT BUT IT COSTS TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND MORE THAN A STANDARD FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY 
IT BRINGS US BACK TO THE LIGHTWEIGHT SUPERCARS WE REVIEWED LAST WEEK 
BECAUSE WHAT ANNOYS ME IS THAT YOU BUY A FERRARI FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THINKING THIS IS AS GOOD AS FERRARI CAN MAKE A CAR 
A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER THEY SAY NO THIS IS BUT IT COSTS AN EXTRA TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND GIVE US ANOTHER TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND 
YOU'LL HAVE A CAR AS GOOD AS WE CAN MAKE IT 
I THINK IT'S LIKE THAT SAINSBURY'S TASTE THE DIFFERENCE CHEESE 
HOLD ON A MINUTE NO IT'S NOT LIKE CHEESE 
THAT'S NOT CHEESE BUT THIS IS AN ANALOGY 
YOU GO TO SAINSBURY'S AND YOU SEE CHEESE THAT COSTS A CERTAIN AMOUNT 
BUT NEXT TO IT TASTE THE DIFFERENCE CHEESE IS MORE EXPENSIVE BUT TASTES REALLY NICE THE BACHELOR LIFE 
BUT WHY DON'T THEY JUST MAKE ALL THE CHEESE LIKE THAT DO THEY JUST MAKE SOMETHING THAT'S A BIT WORSE 
PRICE IT LOWER AND SAY HERE'S RUBBISH CHEESE FOR POOR PEOPLE 
I'M CONFUSED WHY ARE YOU ON THIS PROGRAMME I'M RIGHT AREN'T I 
WHY WOULD YOU DELIBERATELY MAKE CHEESE LESS GOOD THAN YOU CAN MAKE IT I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CHEESE 
IT'S A FERRARI THEY DELIBERATELY MADE THE F. FOUR THIRTY LESS GOOD THAN THEY KNOW IT CAN BE 
THEY BRING OUT A MORE EXPENSIVE ONE PUT TASTE THE DIFFERENCE ON IT AND SELL IT IN SAINSBURY'S 
NOW YOU'VE CONFUSED YOURSELF YOU POOR OLD GOAT 
I'M MOVING IT ON JAMES HAS PLAINLY GONE QUITE MAD WE'RE GETTING BACK TO CARS 
THERE'S A NEW MINI ESTATE CAR THEY'RE CALLING IT THE CLUBMAN IT HAS FIVE DOORS 
BUT THEY'RE NOT WHERE YOU MIGHT EXPECT WE HAVE A PICTURE HERE 
TWO AT THE BACK WHEN YOU CLOSE THOSE THERE'S A BIG LINE DOWN THE CENTRE OF THE CAR 
THEN YOU GET TWO ON THIS SIDE AND ONE ON THE OTHER 
AND YOU CAN TELL IT'S GERMAN HOW 
BECAUSE IF YOU PULL UP IN GERMANY WITH THAT O. K. TO LET YOUR CHILDREN OUT OF THE BACK 
THEY'RE ON THE KERB BUT THEY DON'T SWITCH IT ROUND FOR RIGHT HAND DRIVE 
IN BRITAIN IF YOU OPENED THE BACK DOOR TO LET THE CHILDREN OUT THEY'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD 
SO BRITISH CHILDREN ARE LESS IMPORTANT THAN GERMAN CHILDREN 
IT'S THE ADVERTISING SLOGAN FOR THAT CAR IS IT NO 
I THINK THAT'S A BIT LIKE TESCO'S OWN BRAND BEANS THERE YOU GO 
YES MATE YOU SIT IN YOUR ARMCHAIR LOVE THEY'LL BE ROUND IN A BIT LOVE 
SHALL WE GET ON FIFTH GEAR NEWS 
YOU KNOW WE REVEALED LAST WEEK THAT THEY BURNED OUR FURNITURE 
WELL IT TURNED OUT THAT THIS WEEK ONE OF THE PRESENTERS CAUGHT FIRE 
JASON POTATO PLATO 
WELL ACTUALLY BAINS POTATO NOW 
HE WAS BELTING DOWN THE RUNWAY HIS CAR CAUGHT FIRE HE WAS QUITE BADLY INJURED 
HE HAD TO GO TO HOSPITAL HE BURNT HIS HAND AND HIS FACE 
WE WISH HIM A SPEEDY RECOVERY BUT I'D LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU GOD 
WELL IT'S A SUNDAY SHOW HE LIKES TOP GEAR MORE 
YES GOD'S ON OUR SIDE HE SENT HIS SON ALONG THIS WEEK LOOK JESUS HAS COME 
HAS AMONGST US 
THE SON OF GOD DOES NOT GO TO FIFTH GEAR HE DOESN'T THAT'S NEVER BEEN SAID BEFORE 
NOW WE HAVE A NEW CAR FROM AMERICA LAUNCHED THIS WEEK 
IT'S CALLED THE S. S. C. ULTIMATE AERO 
THERE IT IS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE HORSEPOWER 
NOUGHT TO SIXTY TWENTY EIGHT SECONDS 
THIS WEEK IT SET THE FASTEST EVER SPEED FOR A ROAD LEGAL CAR 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SIX MILES AN HOUR CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT 
THEY SAY THE BODY IS SOLELY CARBON FIBRE AND WEIGHS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE POUNDS 
IF YOU DON'T COUNT THE DOORS BONNET AND THE BOOT 
I WEIGH ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE POUNDS IF YOU DON'T COUNT MY ARMS AND LEGS AND HEAD 
IT ALSO SAYS IT HAS A COMPLETELY FLAT BELLY 
THE ONLY THING IN AMERICA THAT HAS 
HANG ON WE MUSTN'T MOCK THE AMERICANS TOO MUCH 
CREDIT WHERE IT'S DUE THEY'VE DONE IT IT IS THE FASTEST PRODUCTION CAR IN THE WORLD 
I BET THIS IS RUBBISH WHY I BET IT IS BECAUSE THE MAN WHO DID THE SPEED RUN IN IT WAS SEVENTY ONE YEARS OLD 
YEAH BUT THAT JUST PROVES HOW EASY IT IS TO DRIVE NO IT SHOWS THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH FAITH IN IT 
I MEAN WHAT DID THE ADVERT SAY WANTED ELDERLY WIDOWER TO DRIVE A CAR WE'RE NOT SURE ABOUT 
MUST HAVE NOT MUCH ELSE TO LIVE FOR OH 
THAT WON'T BE AS GOOD AS A BUGATTI 
I'M TELLING YOU NOW IT WON'T BE AS GOOD 
I'VE GOT A THING FROM A COMPANY THAT MAKES BRAKE DISCS AND BRAKE PADS AND THINGS 
THEY'RE URGING US TO CHECK OUR BRAKES AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE WORKING PROPERLY 
BECAUSE ACCORDING TO STATISTICS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT ONE IN THREE ACCIDENTS HAPPENS 
BECAUSE A VEHICLE FAILS TO STOP IN TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS ACTUALLY AL LLACC IDE N. T. S. 
LEWIS HAMILTON 
WHAT HE HAD AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE HE DIDN'T STOP IN TIME 
DID YOU SEE IT LAST WEEKEND YES DID YOU SEE IT 
NO WHY WEREN'T YOU WATCHING 
WELL DON'T HAVE A GO NEITHER WAS HE BY THE SOUND OF IT HE CRASHED 
HIS TYRES HAD GONE AND THEN IT GOT MUCH WORSE FOR HIM 
WE FOUND THIS ON THE INTERNET 
STOPPED FOR PETROL ON THE WAY HOME 
OH BAD DAY ALL ROUND EH 
WE HAVE THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF NEWS EVER 
I KNOW YOU PROBABLY IMAGINE WE GO TO WILD PARTIES ALL WEEK 
THIS WEEK WE WENT ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND THIS PORSCHE DESIGN WEBSITE 
IT'S FULL OF ALL THE STUFF YOU'D EXPECT BRIEFCASES WALLETS PENS THAT YOU CAN BUY FOR THREE QUID 
ANYWHERE ELSE BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE PORSCHE WRITTEN ON THEM THEY'RE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION EACH 
COMPLETE RUBBISH 
WE WENT INTO SMOKING TOOLS AND WE DISCOVERED 
FOR THE PORSCHE ENTHUSIAST BOY HAVE YOU GOT TO BE AN ENTHUSIAST 
A PORSCHE DESIGNED PIPE 
THESE ARE REAL GENUINE THEY COST QUITE A LOT OF MONEY BUT THEY COME IN FOUR DIFFERENT COLOURS AND STYLES 
I SPUN OFF IN MY PORSCHE 
MINE WON'T START PROPERLY 
OF COURSE IT WILL 
IT'S A PORSCHE PERSEVERE 
NO WHAT ARE YOU DOING MAN 
OTHER END 
IT'S A NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN PORSCHE THE HOT BIT GOES AT THE BACK 
YOU DON'T LOOK RIGHT WITH THAT 
HAVE YOU NOTICED OVER MY SHOULDER LOOK AT HIM 
THE CHAIR THE PIPE WE'RE BUILDING UP THE PERFECT PICTURE FOR YOU MATE 
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING YOU SEE HE'S POINTING 
I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY GOT ANYTHING TO TELL YOU BUT I JUST WANTED TO POINT AT YOU WITH MY PIPE 
UGH 
THAT'S NOT GONE WELL 
JEREMY HOLD ON JEREMY 
CAN I JUST GET QUITE CLEAR WHAT YOU JUST DID AS A GROWN MAN 
WAS LIGHT A PIPE AND PUT THE WRONG END OF IT IN YOUR MOUTH 
WHAT ARE YOU LIKE ON BONFIRE NIGHT 
YOU BLOODY IDIOT THAT ISN'T THE END OF THE NEWS BUT WE ARE ENDING IT THERE 
IT'S TIME NOW TO MOVE ON 
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THE THREE OF US WERE ASKED TO MAKE 
AMPHIBIOUS CARS AND IF WE'RE HONEST IT DIDN'T GO ALL THAT WELL 
JAMES'S HERALD WAS PRETTY GOOD ON THE WATER 
BUT THERE WERE PROBLEMS ON LAND 
OH COCK RICHARD'S CAMPER VAN WAS RUBBISH ON LAND AND THEN EVEN MORE RUBBISH IN THE WATER IT'S GOING 
MY TOY BOATER ON THE OTHER HAND WAS BRILLIANT EVERYWHERE 
RIGHT UP TO THE MOMENT WHEN IT UM ROLLED OVER 
NOW THAT IS PRETTY MUCH PAR FOR THE COURSE ON TOP GEAR 
WE'RE ALWAYS SETTING OURSELVES AMBITIOUS TARGETS 
ASKING HOW HARD CAN IT BE TO MAKE A CONVERTIBLE PEOPLE CARRIER OR TURN 
A FIAT PANDA INTO A STRETCH LIMO AND EVERYTHING ALWAYS ENDS UP EITHER BROKEN IN HALF OR ON FIRE OR SUNK 
AND THEN WE GIVE UP AND MOVE ON 
BUT WITH AMPHIBIOUS CARS THE PRODUCER SAID WE HAD TO TRY AGAIN 
THEY SAID NO MORE FOOLING ABOUT WE HAD TO CONCENTRATE 
WE WERE TOLD TO REFINE OUR ORIGINAL IDEAS AND THEN MEET 
IN A CAR PARK NEAR SIDCUP WHICH IS JUST OUTSIDE LONDON ON THE M. TWENTY FOUR 
FIVE M. FIVE TWENTY FIVE 
JEREMY WAS THE FIRST TO ARRIVE 
THERE WE ARE NOW OBVIOUSLY 
MY ORIGINAL PLAN OF SIMPLY BOLTING A VERY LARGE OUTBOARD ENGINE TO 
THE BACK OF A PICK UP TRUCK WORKED VERY WELL 
UNTIL IT ROLLED OVER 
TO PREVENT THAT HAPPENING AGAIN I'VE WELDED UP THE DOORS MUCH MORE THOROUGHLY 
THAT SHOULD STOP WATER GETTING INTO THE COCKPIT AND SLOSHING FROM SIDE TO SIDE 
IN THE BACK I'VE FITTED THESE BIG DRUMS WHICH WHEN I GO IN THE WATER 
I SIMPLY LOWER THEM LIKE THIS SO THEY'RE LIKE STABILISERS ON A CHILD'S BICYCLE 
THAT SHOULD GIVE ME MORE UM UM 
UM 
EM 
STABILITY YES THAT 
NEXT HAMMOND ARRIVED 
NOW YOU SEE HAMMOND YES 
WHAT YOU'VE DONE THERE MATE 
IS YOU'VE PARKED A VAN ON TOP OF A BOAT 
NO IT'S BRILLIANT LET ME TELL YOU IT IS A REFINEMENT OF THE THEORY 
CHECK IT OUT FLYING BRIDGE COMPLETELY EQUIPPED 
IT'S NOT A FLYING BRIDGE MORE OR LESS THIS IS WHERE THE GIRLS GO 
UP HERE IN BIKINIS RICHARD I HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE PROBLEM WOULD YOU LIKE TO STEP DOWN YES 
STAND AT THE WHEEL LOOK AHEAD YEAH THAT IS AN ISSUE 
I NEED A SAILING BOX 
AS BEFORE RICHARD HAD STUCK WITH THE CABIN CRUISER PRINCIPLE 
AND AS BEFORE TO MAKE IT MOVE IN THE WATER 
HE'D SIMPLY FIXED A PROPELLER TO THE VOLKSWAGEN'S REAR MOUNTED ENGINE 
SO AS YOU'RE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD THIS PROPELLER IS TURNING A BIT 
HAVE YOU RUNG THE HIGHWAYS DEPARTMENT YES AND TOLD THEM YOU'RE DRIVING A CAR WITH 
EFFECTIVELY A BLENDER ON THE BACK AND THERE WAS ANOTHER ISSUE THIS IS YOUR HULL YES 
THESE ARE HOLES IN IT FIBREGLASS YES THAT'S FOR THE WHEELS 
I'VE SEEN TITANIC IT GOT A HOLE IN IT IT SANK 
WELL I'VE SEALED THEM AROUND THE ARCH WITH FOAM 
SO IF TITANIC HAD BEEN FILLED WITH FOAM IT WOULD'VE BEEN HERE TODAY 
BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT TECHNOLOGY YOU CAN'T KNOCK THEM FOR THAT 
FIBREGLASS HULL PREDOMINANTLY BARELY TIPS THE SCALES AT OVER FIVE TONS AND THE COOLING YEAH YEAH 
JEREMY THEN SHOWED OFF HIS HANDIWORK YOU'VE SET FIRE TO IT BY THE LOOKS OF IT 
THERE WAS A SMALL FIRE THE WELDING 
AND THEN WHILE WAITING FOR JAMES 
OH AGAIN AMBITIOUS YOU'RE THINKING OF WHAT TO OCCUPY YOURSELF WITH WHILST ON THE WATER 
WHILST YOU SINK AGAIN NO NOT THIS TIME 
IT WILL IT WON'T 
IT WILL IT JUST WON'T 
SOME TIME MUCH LATER JAMES ARRIVED IN A FLURRY OF DEJA VU 
IT'S THE SAME VEHICLE THE SAME CAR 
WELL NOT EXACTLY EXACTLY THE SAME CAR 
IT IS THE SAME CAR THE REASON FOR THAT IS MY CAR IF YOU REMEMBER WORKED IT DIDN'T 
IT DID EVERY TIME YOU GOT TO A LOW BRIDGE YOUR MAST WAS AH NOW I HAVE A COLLAPSIBLE MAST 
AND I HAVE A SPINNAKER AND I ALSO HAVE A KEEL COME CENTRE BOARD 
HOW DID YOU GET THAT UNDERNEATH HERE YOU DROP IT DOWN THROUGH THE SLOT LIKE ON A DINGHY 
THAT'S A WHOPPER HAVE YOU SEEN THIS THAT'S WHERE THE WATER WILL BE 
THE WATER WILL SIMPLY WHAT'S THE WORD COME THROUGH THERE 
YOU'LL SINK BEFORE YOU PUT YOUR BIT OF WOOD IN NO IT WON'T I HAVE CALCULATED IT USING ARCHIMEDES 
WHEN A BODY IS WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY IMMERSED IN A FLUID IT EXPERIENCES 
A THRUST EQUAL IN MAGNITUDE TO THE MASS OF THE FLUID DISPLACED THIS WON'T WORK 
WE'D SOON FIND OUT 
THANK YOU SO MUCH HERE'S OUR CHALLENGE COME ON THEN 
IS IT BAD YES 
NO REALLY BAD GO ON 
NO NOT 
AND THEN YOU WILL CROSS THE CHANNEL TO FRANCE 
THAT'S JUST WHAT IS IT WHAT IS IT TWENTY TWO MILES HE'S NOT MAKING IT UP 
MINE WON'T DO THAT 
IF I'D KNOWN IT WAS THE SEA I'D HAVE FITTED A BIGGER ANCHOR THIS IS NOT REALLY A SEA GOING ANCHOR 
AND A LONGER CHAIN YEAH I'M NOT GOING TO NEED THAT THAT WILL SINK AT AROUND THIRTY FEET 
I'M NOT SURE I RECKON MINE WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE KILLED 
NO WE'RE NOT MINE IS ESSENTIALLY A DINGY AND DINGHIES SAIL ACROSS THE CHANNEL EVERY DAY 
I'M FORTY SEVEN YEARS OLD I'M GOING TO BE RUN DOWN BY A KOREAN GRAIN CARRIER MINCED 
YEAH BUT WHAT A DAY 
BEFORE WE COULD SET OFF JAMES HAD TO TAKE DOWN HIS NEW COLLAPSIBLE MAST 
OH TIMBER OH MY GOD 
THAT'S THE LAMP 
FRANCE HERE WE COME 
WHAT'S IT ACTUALLY CAUGHT ON THE SECURITY CAMERA 
WOULD YOU ADMIT THAT YOUR DESIGN IS ALREADY FLAWED 
NO 
FINALLY WE WERE ON THE ROAD AND IT SOON BECAME CLEAR THAT ALL 
THE ADDITIONS HAD TAKEN THE EDGE OFF MY PERFORMANCE 
WHY WAS I HURRYING 
I'M JUST GOING TO RING A SOLICITOR DO MY LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT 
LEAVE EVERYTHING TO THE LIFEBOAT PEOPLE 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE ASKING US TO GO ACROSS THE CHANNEL 
I'M FOLLOWING JEREMY'S PICK UP AND IT LOOKS LIKE A MAN WITH A PICK UP 
WHO'S STOLEN AN OUTBOARD MOTOR AND A COUPLE OF OIL DRUMS ON THE WAY TO A FISHING TRIP 
JAMES AS USUAL HAD FALLEN BEHIND 
BUT OTHERWISE ALL WAS WELL IN HIS WORLD 
THIS IS FANTASTIC I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT WAIT TO TRY OUT MY TRIUMPH 
HERALD IN ITS NEWLY RE RIGGED FORM AND SAIL ACROSS THE CHANNEL 
WHY SHOULDN'T IT WORK 
I HAD JUST ONE CRUMB OF COMFORT 
THIS TIME MINE WAS WORKING ON THE ROAD BUT THEN THE CRUMB WENT AWAY 
OH 
UNFORTUNATELY SOLVING THE NOT FLOATING PROBLEM WITH FOAM MEANS YOU GET ANOTHER ONE CHOKING 
THEN JEREMY ARRIVED 
HAMMOND IS BEING KILLED AND MINE 
WELL IT'S HARD TO KNOW IS THAT SMOKE OR 
AND WE JOLLY SAILOR BOYS WERE 
WELL DONE OH DEAR 
YEAH WHAT YOU'VE DONE 
IS FILL YOUR ENGINE BAY WITH FOAM 
HOLD ON A MINUTE AND THEN WHAT IT'S DONE IS CATCH FIRE 
HOW'S YOUR ENGINE RUINED 
EVERY SINGLE THING WE DO 
JAMES ISN'T EVEN HERE 
I DON'T KNOW 
HOPING THAT THE HOT EXHAUST WOULD BURN AWAY ALL THE FOAM WITHOUT IT 
BECOMING A BIG RUINOUS FIRE WE PRESSED ON OH GOD 
THEY ARE WORSE THAN THEY WERE LAST TIME ON THE ROAD AND WE'VE GOT A MUCH BIGGER CHALLENGE ON THE WATER 
MIND YOU AFTER FIVE MILES HAMMOND WAS BEYOND CARING 
IT IS LIKE THE WEST INDIAN DOPE SMOKING TEAM PRACTISING IN THE CAR 
HELLO 
EVENTUALLY THE EXCESS FOAM DID BURN OFF AND SOON WE ARRIVED IN DOVER 
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING YEAH ONE DAY THEY'RE GOING TO WANT ONE 
WE WOULD BE LAUNCHING FROM THE SLIPWAY ONCE USED BY THE GIANT CROSS CHANNEL HOVERCRAFTS 
SPREAD BEFORE IT WAS DOVER HARBOUR AND BEYOND THE SAFETY OF ITS WALLS TWENTY TWO MILES OF ENGLISH CHANNEL 
THE BUSIEST SHIPPING LANE IN THE WORLD 
THE FISHING RODS 
AMAZINGLY THE ONLY THINGS THAT DID ACTUALLY BREAK ON THE NISSAN'S JOURNEY TO DOVER 
WERE ALL ITS BRAKES' 
I'M TELLING YOU JAMES I CANNOT STOP IT 
I CAN'T STOP IT BY THE TIME JAMES HAD FIXED HIS RUDDER WE WERE RUNNING LATE 
AND THE TIDE WAS COMING IN 
IT'S TEN TO EIGHT YEAH 
IT'S TWENTY TWO MILES 
IF MINE WORKS THAT'S TWENTY FIVE MINUTES 
HOW FAST DO YOU THINK IT GOES FORTY KNOTS GET OFF 
HAVE YOU SEEN THE SIZE OF THE ENGINE ON THE BACK OF IT YOUR TOP SPEED 
VERY SLOW FOUR KNOTS 
YEAH AND THERE'S A THREE KNOT TIDE IT'S A MILE AN HOUR YEAH 
AND YOU TWENTY KNOTS 
NO JAMES LOOK THE POINT IS I'M THE ONLY ONE WITH EVEN A VAGUE HOPE OF GETTING THERE BEFORE NIGHTFALL 
WHY DON'T WE JUST GO WHEN THE TIDE'S GOING OUT THEN IT'LL HELP US 
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA THAT'S TOMORROW 
NO SLACK WATER OR SLACK WATER YEAH 
SLACK WATER IS TOMORROW AT ONE O'CLOCK WE SHALL GO THEN YES 
WE'LL GO TO THE PUB NOW SOUND IDEA 
AND THEN TOMORROW ONE O'CLOCK THAT WILL BE US AT SLACK WATER 
BECAUSE THE WATER IS SLACK 
WHAT'S SLACK WATER 
HONESTLY CROSSING THE CHANNEL HAS GOT TO BE JUST ABOUT THE STUPIDEST IDEA EVER 
YOU HAD THE SENSE THAT I'M GOING TO END UP TODAY WITH HYPERTHERMIA ATTACHED TO A STOMACH PUMP 
WE WERE ALL SO PARANOID ABOUT SINKING 
THAT'S WHY WE PUT ALL THAT FOAM EVERYWHERE TO MAKE THEM FLOAT BETTER 
WE WRAPPED IT ROUND THE MANIFOLD ROUND THE EXHAUST ROUND THE ENGINE 
ROUND ANYWHERE REALLY HOT BASICALLY WHICH IS WHY THERE WAS ALL THAT SMOKE POURING OUT 
ANYWAY IT'S NOW TIME TO PUT A STAR IN OUR REASONABLY PRICED CAR 
MY GUEST TONIGHT WAS ONCE SUSPENDED FROM CHANNEL FOUR FOR USING THE F. WORD 
ON LIVE TELEVISION BEFORE THE WATERSHED 
I MEAN FOR SAKE 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN JOOLS HOLLAND 
OH THIS IS SOMETHING OH LOVELY TO SEE YOU 
IT'S LIKE RICHARD HAMMOND SO SMALL AND DINKY HAVE A SEAT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I SHALL 
NOW YOU'RE THE SIZE OF RICHARD HAMMOND 
YES BUT LOOKING INTO YOUR PAST LIFE OLD BRITISH MOTOR BIKES YOU PLAY THE PIANO YOU VIEW FOREIGN FOOD 
WITH SUSPICION YOU SAY PEOPLE SHOULDN'T GO ABROAD ON HOLIDAY BUT SHOULD SPEND IT IN THE SHED 
SEPARATED AT BIRTH I THINK FROM JAMES MAY 
WHAT A LOVELY FELLOW HE IS WHAT A TALENTED AND GREAT MIND THAT MAN HAS 
IT'S VERY HARD THOUGH FOR ME TO RECONCILE THESE VIEWS WITH HOW I FIRST REMEMBER SEEING YOU 
ON THE TUBE WHICH WAS OF COURSE COMPLETE ANARCHY WELL THAT WAS IN EARLY HAPPY DAYS 
IN MANY WAYS THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT TELEVISION WAS PUT INTO THE HANDS OF THE LUNATICS 
NOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED 
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED 
WE MADE IT UP AS WE WENT ALONG AND IT WAS LIVE AND IT WAS FRIDAY IT WAS FIVE THIRTY P. M. THE PUBS WERE OPEN 
YOU HAD TO DO ALL INTERVIEWS IN A MINUTE THAT WAS THE OTHER THING 
BECAUSE IT WAS YOUTH TELEVISION I SUPPOSE 
THEY THOUGHT EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION SPAN WAS THAT LONG 
WE ONLY HAD A MINUTE TO DO ANYTHING 
WE HAD MILES DAVIS ONE OF THE GREAT JAZZ LEGENDS OF ALL TIME 
AND HE WAS PROMOTING HIS DRAWINGS 
THEY SAID YOU'VE GOT A MINUTE TO INTERVIEW HIM 
I SAID BUT HE'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN JAZZ EVER I SAID SURELY 
SURELY HE'S WORTH MORE THAN A MINUTE 
THEY SAID ALL RIGHT YOU CAN HAVE A MINUTE AND TWENTY 
SO I SAT AND I SAID TO HIM WELL MR. DAVIS HE'S JUST GOT THESE GREAT SORT OF SUNGLASSES 
I SAID WOULD YOU CONNECT YOUR ART TO YOUR MUSIC HE SAID H. M. M. 
WOULD I CONNECT MY ART TO MY MUSIC 
OOH THE PAIN 
YEAH 
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION 
I'M THINKING I DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT AND HE SAID 
WOULD I CONNECT MY ART TO MY MUSIC 
GOOD 
AND THEN THE WOMAN BEHIND THEY'RE PROBABLY DOING IT NOW COS IT'S SUCH A LONG STORY 
THEY GO LIKE THIS SHE'S GOING 
IT'S GOING DOWN TO NO TIME AT ALL THEN IT'S LIKE THIS AND HE SAID YEAH 
THIRTY YEARS AGO YOU WERE WITH SQUEEZE WHICH WAS PART OF THE PUNK ERA 
DO YOU MISS THE GOBBING 
IF THIS WAS NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THEY WOULD JUST BE SPITTING ON US IT WOULD BE A HAILSTORM YES 
BUT HONESTLY IT WAS A COMPLIMENT AT THE TIME IT WAS FEEL FREE TO GOZ ON US 
THAT WAS BACK IN THE DAY 
BUT THEN OUR MANAGER MILES COPELAND HE SAID TO INGRATIATE YOURSELF WITH ANYBODY DOING THAT 
HE SAID THERE'S SOME BEER BY THE STAGE WHY NOT HAND TINS OF BEER OUT 
SO WE DID THAT AND THEN THEY CHUCKED THE EMPTY CANS AT US 
YOU EVEN MET JOEY RAMONE DOES ANYONE HERE KNOW WHO THAT IS 
YES ONE PERSON AND THAT'S ENOUGH BECAUSE THIS IS THE B. B. C. 
WE'RE NOT GOING FOR RATINGS WE'RE GOING FOR THE ONE MAN OVER THERE WHAT WAS HE LIKE 
WE WERE PLAYING IN THIS CLUB CALLED CBGB'S WHICH WAS A FANTASTIC PUNK CLUB 
AFTER WE FINISHED HE SAID DO YOU WANT TO COME DOWN TO THIS CLUB 
A VERY NICE PLACE CALLED KZ'S 
WE WENT THERE AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN ANYWHERE LIKE IT BEFORE OR SINCE 
IN EVERY ROOM THERE WAS AN ORGY OR 
DRUG TAKING OR SOME SORT OF ABSURD SCENES IT WAS LIKE A STRANGE FILM OF CALIGULA OR SOMETHING 
ANYWAY I WAS STANDING THERE TALKING TO ONE OF THE RAMONES 
I LOOKED DOWN AND I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THERE WAS 
ONE OF THE WOMENFOLK OF NEW YORK PERFORMING AN ACT UPON HIS PERSON 
DO YOU KNOW HE RATHER LOST INTEREST IN WHAT I WAS SAYING 
UNFORTUNATELY WE MUST NOW STOP NO WE MUSTN'T I TELL YOU SOMETHING YOU'VE THIS NEW ALBUM OUT 
WELL IT'S GOT A LOT OF THE BEST OF THE COLLABORATIONS THAT WE'VE DONE 
WE'VE GOT A CLIP OF IT OH MY WORD JUST TO SHOW YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE THIS GUY PLAYS WITH 
SORRY ABOUT THE TELLY 
TELL ME WHERE HAVE ALL THE GOOD GUYS GONE 
AND YOU CAN TAKE A HORSE TO THE WATER 
BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE HIM DRINK 
OH NO 
OH NO 
THAT'S EVERYBODY 
MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT YOU'RE NOT THERE PLAYING THE DRUMS 
THERE WOULD'VE BEEN PEOPLE WRAPPING THEIR KEYBOARDS ROUND MY NECK 
IF I'D BEEN TRYING TO KEEP TIME NOW CARS MOTORS NOW YOU'RE TALKING THE THING 
THAT FASCINATES ME MOST ABOUT YOUR CARS IS THAT I HEARD THAT YOU CHOOSE A CAR ON HOW IT SMELLS 
OH VERY IMPORTANT FOR INSTANCE I'VE GOT AN AUSTIN WESTMINSTER BOUGHT ENTIRELY BECAUSE OF ITS SMELL 
NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE AS USED BY THE POLICE 
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY EVER CAUGHT ANYBODY IN IT 
YOU WIND DOWN THE WINDOW JUST THIS MUCH AND THEN 
LAW AND ORDER NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
THAT'S WHAT IT SMELLS OF EXACTLY 
WHAT OTHER CARS HAVE YOU GOT I HAVE AN OLD ASTON MARTIN THEY'RE QUITE FUN 
YOU'VE GOT AN E. TYPE YES 
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED JAGS 
I THOUGHT JAGS WERE SO WONDERFUL TO DRIVE 
THE V. TWELVE JAG ENGINE IS TO THIS DAY THE SMOOTHEST ENGINE THAT 
THERE HAS EVER BEEN I'VE DONE THE THRUPENNY BIT TEST ON ALL OF THEM 
YOU GET THE THRUPENNY BIT YOU PLACE IT ON TOP OF THE ENGINE 
THIS IS NOT RHYMING SLANG NOW 
THAT'S RIGHT OH IT MATTERS LITTLE 
WHAT AN AMAZING THING TO DO WHATEVER COMES TO HAND WHAT A TEST 
IT'LL STAND THERE AND YOU CAN REV IT UP AND IT DOESN'T BAT AN EYELID 
YOU'RE A MEMBER OF A GREAT MANY CLASSIC CAR CLUBS AS I UNDERSTAND 
LET'S SEE NOW WELL THE E. TYPE CLUB OF COURSE YOU KNOW PHILIP PORTER 
THE ROLLS ROYCE ENTHUSIASTS THE BENTLEY DRIVERS' CLUB VERY GOOD 
FOR SPARE PARTS YOU CAN GET A BENTLEY DRIVERS' CLUB DRESSING GOWN 
WHICH YOU CAN ONLY YOU CAN GET A PORSCHE PIPE 
ONLY RECOGNISABLE BY ANOTHER BENTLEY DRIVERS' CLUB PERSON IF YOU'RE IN DRESSING GOWNS TOGETHER

O. K. NOW BACK TO TONIGHT'S BIG CHALLENGE 
THE THREE OF US HAVE BUILT AMPHIBIOUS CARS 
WE'VE DRIVEN THEM DOWN TO DOVER WITH ONLY ONE OR TWO SMALL FIRES TO CONTEND WITH ON THE WAY 
WHEN WE LEFT THE ACTION WE WERE PREPARING TO SAIL THEM ACROSS THE CHANNEL TO FRANCE 
LAST TIME WE TRIED AMPHIBIOUS CARS WE WERE FLUMMOXED BY A SMALL RESERVOIR IN STAFFORDSHIRE 
THIS TIME WE FACED NOT JUST TWENTY TWO MILES OF OPEN SEA BUT THE BUSIEST SHIPPING LANE IN THE WORLD 
NEVERTHELESS WE WERE DUE TO SET SAIL AT SOMETHING CALLED SLACK WATER 
IT WAS LOVELY MORNING AND THE SEA INSIDE THE HARBOUR WAS CALM AND INVITING 
OUTSIDE THE HARBOUR THOUGH 
DESPITE THE ROUGHNESS CAPTAIN COCKSURE WAS SUPREMELY CONFIDENT 
IN HIS ENGINEERING AND EAGER TO GET GOING 
HAMMOND AND I HOWEVER WEREN'T 
HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED THE MEANING OF LIFE 
NO BUT I THINK WE SHOULD 
AND NOW'S THE TIME OH YEAH YEAH 
I'VE CHECKED IT FOR WATER TIGHTNESS AND GOT ALL THE SHEETS 
WHICH IS THE CORRECT NAUTICAL TERM FOR THESE PIECES OF STRING IN THE RIGHT POSITION 
IT IS ALL SHIPSHAPE AND READY TO GO 
HOW MANY GRAINS OF SUGAR ARE THERE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD 
WE SAY BLINDLY I'LL HAVE ONE SUGAR 
HOW MANY ARE THERE ONE YEAH 
TWO 
ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN TWO 
ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN 
THREE HAVE YOU STARTED AGAIN 
YEAH I LOST COUNT I WANT TO GET IT RIGHT 
WE HAVE TO GO 
THAT THING'S GONNA LEAVE THEN THE HARBOUR'S EMPTY I WANT TO GO 
FINALLY THEY ARRIVED BACK YOU'RE TWO AND THREE QUARTER HOURS LATE NO 
A LOT OF STUFF TO DO SLACK WATER IS IN 
NOW IN THE SEA 
LISTEN BEFORE WE SET OFF I'VE JUST GOT 
A FEW MORE THINGS TO DO 
THE NIGHT BEFORE WHILE A BIT DRUNK I'D STUCK HYDROFOIL BIN LIDS 
TO THE SIDE OF MY PICK UP AND I NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THE GLUE HAD SET 
BUT JAMES WOULDN'T WAIT 
RIGHT I'M GOING 
HE'S GOING HE'S OFF HE'S GOING HE'S DOING IT 
IT'S A CAR IT'S STILL A CAR 
SAIL JIB SAIL 
YOU'RE COMING BACK NOW IT'S A CAR AGAIN 
CENTREBOARD 
HE'S GOT NO RUDDER IT'S THAT WAY 
HE'S GOT NO RUDDER IN THE WATER OH YEAH 
AND DAME ELLEN MAY HAD ANOTHER PROBLEM 
THE CENTREBOARD'S STUCK 
HE'S GOT FURTHER THAT WAY THAN HE HAS THAT WAY 
I'M ENJOYING THIS I WAS SO PREOCCUPIED WITH MY CENTREBOARD 
I WASN'T LOOKING WHERE I WAS GOING 
OH MY HE'S GONNA HIT THE PIER 
HERE COMES THE RESCUE BOAT HE'S BEEN RESCUED AFTER 
A MINUTE AND A HALF 
IT'S SO UNFAIR 
THE RESCUE BOAT NUDGED ME BACK TO OPEN WATER 
WHERE I DISCOVERED MY ARCHIMEDES CALCULATIONS WERE A BIT OUT 
I WOULD SAY THAT CAR'S SINKING AS WELL MAYDAY 
HE'S GOING DOWN I THINK WE SHOULD GET IN THERE 
THIS CAN ONLY GO WELL 
HERE WE GO 
OH YEAH 
ONCE AGAIN THE PICK UP TRUCK IS WORKING 
YES 
IT WORKS I AM FLOATING 
AMAZINGLY ALL THREE OF US WERE FLOATING 
WELL WHEN I SAY THREE 
IT'S GOING DOWN 
RICHARD OFFERED TO PICK JAMES UP BUT HE HAD A PROBLEM 
YOU CAN'T STOP 
NO I CAN'T STOP THE ENGINE 
SEE YOU THEN OH BLOODY HELL 
DO YOU WANT TO COME ON THIS BOAT 
UP TO A POINT YES WILL YOU ADMIT IT'S A BRILLIANT PIECE OF DESIGN 
NO BUGGER OFF 
GOODBYE 
RICHARD AND I RETURNED TO LAND BECAUSE WE WANTED TO BE THERE 
TO OFFER JAMES REASSURANCE AND SYMPATHY 
YOU DESIGNED A RUBBISH CAR AND YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT SAILING 
AMAZINGLY HOWEVER JAMES INSISTED THAT HIS HERALD 
AND THE SNAPPED MAST COULD BE FIXED AND SO WITH HELP 
FROM ME AND JEREMY 
TWO HOURS LATER HE WAS BACK IN BUSINESS 
HERE WE GO LET'S GO 
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
I'M ACTUALLY USING MY WEIGHT TO COUNTER THE ROLL OF THE CRAFT 
OW 
IS THAT YOUR TOP SPEED 
I'M FLAT OUT 
EVEN SO I WAS A LOT FASTER THAN JAMES 
SO JEREMY AND I LEFT HIM BEHIND 
AND PRETTY SOON WE WERE AT THE MOUTH OF THE HARBOUR FACING THE OPEN SEA 
THAT'S CHOPPY OUT THERE 
I CAN'T DO THAT NOT IN A VAN 
MATE IT'S HORRIBLE 
MAYBE IF WE SNUCK UP ON IT YEAH 
SNEAK UP ON THE SEA 
THAT'S BRILLIANT 
MEANWHILE BACK WITH CAPTAIN PUGWASH 
SOD IT 
RIGHT NOW SAIL 
OW 
WE WERE LEAVING THE HARBOUR YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT'S COMING I CAN 
I CAN JUST SEE SKY SEA SKY SEA 
WHOA 
MY GOD THIS IS BIG NOW 
QUITE SCARED QUITE SCARED 
QUITE REALLY SCARED 
WHY THE BLOODY HELL WON'T IT TURN ROUND 
OW THING 
WHOA IT'S COMING THROUGH THE SUN ROOF I'M GONNA TRY AND TURN 
BLOODY HELL 
OH 
THESE ARE QUITE BIG DON'T LIKE THAT 
DON'T TURN ON A WAVE 
WAIT OR SOMETHING 
I DON'T KNOW I GOT SCARED 
OH MY GOD AGH 
NO NO NO 
IN SEAS LIKE THIS AND WITH MY PUNY POWER 
I BRAVELY DECIDED TO HEAD BACK TO THE HARBOUR 
THEN JEREMY BRAVELY FOLLOWED SUIT 
MAYDAY 
OW 
IS IT NOT WORKING WELL JAMES HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS 
WELL PREPARE TO SUCKLE ON IT 
THANK YOU 
SORRY MATE 
AS JEREMY RESCUED JAMES I REALISED THAT THE BIG SEAS HAD DAMAGED MY PRECIOUS CRAFT 
MY STEERING'S BROKEN 
I JUST GO IN FASTER CIRCLES 
I WAS STUCK IN THE ENTRANCE TO THE HARBOUR 
OH MY GOD THERE IS THE SEACAT 
HE CAN MOVE 
BUT HE CONTINUED ON COURSE AND NOW JAMES WAS A SITTING DUCK AS WELL 
NO TIME TO LOSE WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO 
JUST NUDGE THE FRONT GENTLY BACK TO PORT 
I CAN'T GET IN 
COME ON ONTO THE HELM YOU BITCH 
I CAN'T DO GENTLY THAT'S NOT ROUND THAT'S BACKWARDS YOU PILLOCK 
I DON'T WANT TO GO THAT WAY NOW 
GO LEFT 
AND THEN 
OH NOT ANOTHER ONE 
NEVER IN MARITIME HISTORY HAS A SHIP HAD TO DODGE SO MUCH FLOTSAM AND JETSAM WHILE COMING INTO DOVER 
SORRY IT WAS HIM SORRY SORRY 
AND THIS MADE US BE IN TROUBLE 
MORNING OFFICER 
YEAH FINE THANK YOU EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL 
WE WERE ORDERED BACK TO LAND BUT GETTING THERE WASN'T EASY 
MATE MY ENGINE IS LETTING GO 
IT'S DYING THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT 
GENTLY 
AND I PULLED RICHARD IN 
THAT'S HUMILIATING 
SO WE SET OUT FOR FRANCE TWICE YEAH 
AND WE MADE DOVER 
JAMES'S BOAT WAS NOW BEYOND REPAIR 
BUT LUCKILY JEREMY WAS ON HAND TO COMFORT HIM 
YOU FAILED 
THANK YOU 
FURTHER ATTEMPT HERE WE GO 
TODAY THE WIND HAD DROPPED AND THE SEA WAS MUCH CALMER 
WE'RE GOING TO FRANCE THIS TIME WE ARE GOING 
I WAS NOW POWERED BY AN OUTBOARD I'D BOUGHT FROM JEREMY 
FOR A MILLION POUNDS AND JAMES WAS MY CABIN BOY 
IF YOU'D GO BELOW PLEASE CABIN BOY AND A CUP OF TEA RIGHT SIR 
O. I. PRESCOTT 
I'LL HAVE A BACON SANDWICH 
RICHARD'S MILLION POUND OUTBOARD WASN'T EXACTLY GUTSY 
SO IN THE SPIRIT OF THE SEA AND IN KEEPING OF THE MARITIME CODE 
I GUNNED IT AND LEFT THEM BEHIND 
OH SHE'S RIDING THE WAVES LIKE A TWIG 
MEANWHILE BACK ON THE CABIN CRUISER 
BLOODY HELL 
MATE WHAT THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF WATER IT'S UP TO NOT AGAIN 
AS YOU CAN SEE THIS MORNING THE SEA IS A MILL POND 
WE HOPE TO CAPITALISE ON THAT AND MAKE GOOD PROGRESS 
BEFORE THE WAVES BUILD UP WHICH THEY INEVITABLY WILL 
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I'VE BEEN IN THIS RUDDY SEA YEAH 
TECHNICALLY IT WASN'T MY FAULT 
I'M DISAPPOINTED I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA MAKE IT SORRY MATE THE CUP SANK 
WITH TYPICAL GOOD GRACE 
JEREMY CAME BACK TO PICK US UP 
AND THEN ANNOUNCED WE'D HAVE TO GO BACK TO DOVER 
THIS SEEMED LIKE A WASTE OF TIME BUT AS WE LINED UP FOR OUR FOURTH ATTEMPT HIS REASONING BECAME CLEAR 
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO RICHARD BRANSON SET A RECORD FOR CROSSING THE CHANNEL IN AN AMPHIBIOUS CAR 
ONE HOUR FORTY MINUTES SIX SECONDS 
AND NO WAY 
IT'S AN AVERAGE SPEED OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHT KNOTS 
SO WE GO FOR IT WE GIVE IT A SHOT 
IN CALAIS FOR LUNCH BEARDY YOU'RE GOING DOWN 
GUYS CAN I ASK ONE QUESTION 
WHAT WHERE'S FRANCE 
WE FOLLOW THE FERRY BUT NOT THE ONE GOING TO HOLLAND 
SOON THE THREE MEN IN A BOAT WERE AN INCREDIBLE TWO MILES FROM ENGLAND 
SINCE WE WERE GOING FOR A RECORD WE HAD TO WORK OUT OUR SPEED 
THIS IS OUR SPEEDOMETER WE'VE TIED KNOTS IN A ROPE YOU THROW IT IN 
AND YOU SEE HOW MANY PASS THROUGH YOUR FINGERS IN A GIVEN TIME 
IT'S A VERY ACCURATE SYSTEM 
CAPTAIN ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TEN KNOTS 
ONE HUNDRED TEN WHAT'S THAT IN MILES AN HOUR 
TWENTY FIVE 
BECAUSE WE WERE BLASTING ALONG AT A STEADY ONE TWENTY FIVE M. P. H. 
WE HAD A VISIT FROM THE COASTGUARD 
THIS IS THE U. K. COASTGUARD AIRCRAFT PLEASE STATE YOUR INTENTIONS 
OUR INTENTIONS ARE TO GO ACROSS THE CHANNEL FASTER THAN BEARDY BRANSON 
IN THAT CASE I WISH YOU GOOD LUCK AND BON VOYAGE 
I WANT TO DO THAT FOR A JOB THAT'S BRILLIANT 
AND THEN ALL YOU DO IS JUMP OUT AND WRESTLE ALBANIANS 
AMAZINGLY OUR VESSEL PLOUGHED ON WITHOUT MISHAP AND THEN 
LAND AHOY 
FRANCE 
WE CAN SEE FRANCE 
FROM OUR PICK UP TRUCK 
MIND YOU JEREMY DO YOU WANT TO BE DEPRESSED WHAT LOOK AT ENGLAND 
BOLDLY GOING FURTHER THAN ANY PICK UP HAD GONE BEFORE WE WERE SOON IN THE SHIPPING LANES 
BLOODY HELL WHAT DO WE DO NOW 
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHOSE RIGHT OF WAY IT IS 
THAT'S ON A CONSTANT BEARING AS WELL 
WHICH MEANS WE'RE GONNA HIT IT 
OH GOD NO 
DO YOU RECKON I'LL MAYBE GO BEHIND IT YEAH I'D GO BEHIND IT 
YEAH YEAH I THINK BEHIND IT IS BEST 
HAVING MISSED ALL THE BIG SCARY BOATS WE TURNED OUR ATTENTION BACK TO BRANSON'S RECORD 
WE'VE FAILED WE LOST 
NOW IT WAS JUST A QUESTION OF SEEING IF WE COULD MAKE IT 
BUT WITH EIGHT MILES TO GO IT STARTED TO GET CHOPPY 
WE'RE GOING DOWN BOYS NO 
IT'S POURING IN 
OH MY GOD LOOK IN THERE NOW 
I DON'T LIKE THAT 
WE'RE IN BIG TROUBLE 
I DON'T LIKE THIS 
THINGS WERE EVEN WORSE AT THE BACK 
WE'RE TAKING ON A HELL OF A LOT OF WATER 
SO WE SENT JAMES TO THE FRONT TO ACT AS BALLAST 
I'M GETTING A BIT BORED WITH SINKING FRANKLY 
MERCIFULLY AS WE GOT INTO THE LEE OR SOMETHING OR OTHER 
THE WATERS CALMED AND WE COULD TASTE SUCCESS 
THE TOWN OF SANGATTE WAS ABOUT TO GET THREE MORE IMMIGRANTS 
NEVER MIND THAT WE'D AIMED FOR CALAIS AND MISSED FRANCE IS FRANCE 
COME ON COME ON WE'RE TWENTY YARDS FROM FRANCE 
TO SUCCEED WE HAD TO GET UP THE BOAT RAMP 
BUT THAT MEANT GOING THROUGH THE BREAKERS 
NO 
WHERE'S THAT COME FROM 
I REALLY THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA TIP OVER 
WE'RE ON THE ROCKS 
WE'RE GOING UP THE BEACH NOW 
SKILFULLY JAMES GOT A ROPE ROUND THE FRONT BUMPER 
AND THEN A GAP IN THE WAVES I WENT FOR IT 
NO 
THAT'S GOOD 
THE PICK UP HAD LANDED MERCI BIEN 
FINALLY 
FINALLY WE GOT SOMETHING RIGHT 
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT 
WE GOT SOMETHING RIGHT HANG ON A MINUTE THOUGH 
WE MADE THIS CHART OF CHANNEL CROSSING SOLUTIONS 
AND OURS DOESN'T COME OUT THAT WELL TO BE HONEST 
LET'S LOOK AT THE COST FIRST OF ALL 
THE TUNNEL COSTS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
THE FERRY FORTY 
OUR AMPHIBIOUS VEHICLES 
JUST UNDER NINETEEN THOUSAND 
THIS IS A GOOD POINT WELL MADE IT GETS WORSE 
LET'S LOOK AT THE TIME TAKEN ON THE TUNNEL THIRTY FIVE MINUTES 
ON THE FERRY NINETY MINUTES 
FOR THE AMPHIBIOUS VEHICLES THAT JUST ABOUT FOUR DAYS 
YES BUT THE BEAUTY OF THE AMPHIBIOUS VEHICLE HERE IS THAT YOU CAN REUSE IT 
IN J. U. S. T. ONE TWENTY CROSSINGS IT WOULD PAY FOR ITSELF 
BUT THE THING IS JEREMY AT FOUR DAYS PER CROSSING TO DO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY CROSSINGS 
YOU'D HAVE TO DO NOTHING OTHER THAN GO BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ACROSS THE CHANNEL 
FOR A YEAR AND A HALF BEFORE IT'S PAID FOR ITSELF 
ANOTHER GOOD POINT AND AS WE'VE PROVED 
YOU'VE GOT A TWO IN THREE CHANCE OF SINKING ANYWAY 
SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE'VE ONCE AGAIN BEEN AMBITIOUS BUT RUBBISH THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SAYING YEAH 
ON THAT BOMBSHELL IT'S TIME TO END THE SHOW 
WE WON'T SEE YOU NEXT WEEK BECAUSE SOME DRUNK MEN ARE PLAYING BILLIARDS 
BUT WE'LL SEE YOU THE WEEK AFTER THAT THANKS FOR WATCHING GOODNIGHT
