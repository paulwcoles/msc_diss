ROMEO JULIET AND HAMLET AT THE B. B. C. PROMS THIS EVENING 
AS VALERY GERGIEV BRINGS HIS LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA TO THE PROMS 
GOOD EVENING RUSSIA DOMINATES TONIGHT 
AS GERGIEV CONDUCTS TWO OF TCHAIKOVSKY'S 
SHAKESPEARIAN FANTASY OVERTURES 
ALEXANDER TORADZE WILL BE PLAYING PROKOFIEV'S SECOND PIANO CONCERTO 
AND LATER ON WE'LL HEAR PROKOFIEV'S SEVENTH AND LAST SYMPHONY 
DURING THE INTERVAL TONIGHT WE'LL BE TALKING WITH VALERY GERGIEV 
NICHOLAS KENYON DEPARTING DIRECTOR OF THE B. B. C. PROMS WILL BE HERE 
SO IT'S TCHAIKOVSKY TO START THE FANTASY OVERTURE FROM ROMEO AND JULIET 
WRITTEN WHEN HE WAS TWENTY EIGHT STILL TO COMPOSE ANYTHING OF POPULAR OR CRITICAL ACCLAIM 
THE SUBJECT WAS SUGGESTED BY MILY BALAKIREV 
ANOTHER COMPOSER WHO WAS A HUGE INFLUENCE ON TCHAIKOVSKY 
IT WAS PREMIERED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY THE RECEPTION WASN'T QUITE WHAT TCHAIKOVSKY HOPED 
AND HE REPLACED THE ORIGINAL INTRODUCTION 
AND RE WORKED SECTIONS DEPICTING THE FEUDING MONTAGUES AND CAPULETS 
EVEN THEN HE WASN'T SATISFIED AND A DECADE LATER HE REWROTE THE ENDING 
FINALLY GIVING IT A CONCLUSION THAT HE WAS HAPPY WITH 
AND IT'S IN THIS VERSION THAT WE'LL HEAR THE WORK THIS EVENING 
FRIAR LAURENCE IS EVOKED BY A CHORALE THEME 
FOR CLARINETS AND BASSOONS 
A FAST MAIN THEME IN B. MINOR SUGGESTS THE WARRING SWORDFIGHTS 
OF THE MONTAGUES AND THE CAPULETS 
AND THE LOVE THEME OF ROMEO AND JULIET IS IN THE SURPRISINGLY DISTANT KEY OF D. FLAT MAJOR 
THE LOVE THEME OF COURSE ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS TUNES THAT TCHAIKOVSKY EVER WROTE 
WHEN TCHAIKOVSKY FIRST SET OUT TO TACKLE THE FANTASY OVERTURE FOR ROMEO AND JULIET 
HE STRUGGLED TO MAKE HEADWAY HE WROTE TO HIS MENTOR MILY BALAKIREV 
I DIDN'T WANT TO WRITE YOU BEFORE NOW UNTIL I'D SKETCHED AT LEAST SOMETHING OF THE OVERTURE 
BUT JUST IMAGINE I'M COMPLETELY PLAYED OUT 
AND NOT EVEN ONE MILDLY TOLERABLE IDEA WILL COME INTO MY HEAD 
I'M BEGINNING TO FEAR THAT MY MUSE HAS FLOWN OFF 
BUT THANK GOODNESS THE MUSE RETURNED 
VALERY GERGIEV CONDUCTS THE LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA 
IN TCHAIKOVSKY'S FANTASY OVERTURE ROMEO AND JULIET 
TCHAIKOVSKY'S FANTASY OVERTURE ROMEO AND JULIET 
PERFORMED BY THE LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA 
CONDUCTED BY VALERY GERGIEV 
ANDREW HAVERON GUEST LEADING THE ORCHESTRA THIS EVENING 
WELL A QUICK RE SET OF THE STAGE NOW 
THE PIANO IS MOVED INTO THE CENTRE AHEAD OF PROKOFIEV'S SECOND PIANO CONCERTO 
WHICH WILL BE PLAYED BY ALEXANDER TORADZE 
A GREAT FRIEND OF GERGIEV AS WELL AS BEING A COLLEAGUE 
HERE I'M JOINED LIVE BY ZOE MARTLEW COMPOSER AND CELLIST 
AND BY THE WRITER AND BROADCASTER TOM SERVICE WELCOME 
GERGIEV TALKS ABOUT HOW IF TCHAIKOVSKY HAD LIVED A FEW GENERATIONS LATER 
HE'D HAVE BEEN A FANTASTIC FILM MUSIC COMPOSER 
THAT PIECE IS A GREAT ILLUSTRATION OF THAT FULL OF RICH THEMES AND IDEAS AND REALLY EVOCATIVE MUSIC 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY SPARKLING ORCHESTRATION 
LISTENING TO THAT PERFORMANCE I WAS REMINDED MUSSORGSKY ONCE ACCUSED TCHAIKOVSKY 
OF OPENLY PRACTISING THE RELIGION OF UNCONDITIONAL BEAUTY 
AND HERE WE ABSOLUTELY HEAR IT 
THAT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE 
GERGIEV DOES SOME EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WITH TEMPOS AND DYNAMICS 
AND THIS IS EXPENSIVE PLAYING 
THE STRINGS ARE USING RUSSIAN BOWINGS 
AND A MUCH TIGHTER VIBRATO THAN YOU NORMALLY HEAR 
THIS IS A RUSSIAN SOUND HE GETS 
INTENSELY DRAMATIC VERY EFFECTIVE AND TAKES ENORMOUS RISKS 
AND OF COURSE THAT WONDERFUL MERCURIAL SENSE YOU ALWAYS GET WITH GERGIEV 
HE LOOKS A BIT LIKE A SORCERERMIXING UP A SPELL ABSOLUTELY 
OR MAYBE A JELLYFISH OF SOME DESCRIPTION 
BUT CERTAINLY IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN GERGIEV WITH THE L. S. O. 
AND YOU CAN SEE THE PLAYERS ARE ON THE EDGE OF THEIR SEATS 
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THEY QUITE KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN 
SOME OF THE TEMPO THINGS WERE SO EXTREME 
THE LOVE THEME WAS THE SLOWEST I'VE EVER HEARD IT THE WAY IT CAME BACK 
IN THE FAST WITH THE ALLEGRO GIUSTO THEME THEN IT GOT SLOWER AND SLOWER 
AND YOU COULD SEE THE PLAYERS GOING IS HE REALLY DOING THIS YES GO WITH IT 
BUT THE AMAZING THING IS THEY ALL GO WITH HIM 
YEAH THAT CREATES GATHERING EXCITEMENT 
AND IT WORKS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO LISTEN TO EACH OTHER 
SO IT CREATES CHAMBER MUSIC ON THE STAGE YOU HAVE A UNITY 
I SORT OF THINK THAT BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO SHEER TERROR A LOT OF THE TIME YEAH YEAH 
THEY'RE LISTENING BUT THEY'RE ALSO WATCHING 
BECAUSE IF YOU SEE THIS WHERE THE HELL DO YOU PLAY NO BEAT 
THEY HAVE TO BE SO HAVE A KIND OF TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION WITH ONE ANOTHER 
JUST TO KNOW WHEN TO PLAY IT WAS VERY INTERESTING WATCHING HIM IN REHEARSAL 
IT'S THIS REHEARSAL WHERE HE BREAKS EVERYTHING APART 
ONE OF THE PLAYERS SAID IN THE EARLIER REHEARSALS THEY WERE PLAYING THE PIECES STRAIGHT THROUGH 
IT'S ONLY TODAY THEY START FORENSICALLY SEPARATING THEM 
YEAH A RISKY PROCESS CAN'T BE MUCH FUN FOR THE MUSICIANS 
IF YOU LISTEN TO THE MONTAGUE AND CAPULET BIT ON THE STRINGS 
WHICH SOUNDS LIKE RUSLAN AND LYUDMILA YEAH 
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY TOGETHER 
MIRACULOUSLY I'VE NO IDEA HOW 
I MEAN THE FUNNY THING IS ALSO THAT THIS GUY IS PRINCIPAL CONDUCTOR OF THIS ORCHESTRA 
BUT HE'S ONLY DOING TWELVE CONCERTS A YEAR 
IT'S A FAIRLY EXTRAORDINARY APPOINTMENT ON THAT LEVEL 
WITH ANYONE ELSE YOU'D SAY IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE TO HAVE HIM AS PRINCIPAL CONDUCTOR 
RUNNING THE MARIINSKY THEATRE PRINCIPAL CONDUCTOR OF ROTTERDAM WHY NOT DO THE L. S. O. AS WELL 
THE PAY OFF IS SOMETHING LIKE TONIGHT THESE ARE GOING TO BE TWELVE ONE OFF OCCASIONS 
WE'LL COME BACK TO HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ORCHESTRA LATER 
THE PIANO IS IN PLACE AFTER THE TRADITIONAL HEAVE HO 
SO LET'S MOVE ON TO PROKOFIEV'S SECOND PIANO CONCERTO 
ALEXANDER TORADZE IS GOING TO PLAY THAT FOR US THIS EVENING 
ZOE PROKOFIEV WAS A YOUNG MAN WHEN HE WROTE THIS WITH A LOT TO PROVE 
YEAH HE WAS THE BAD BOY OF THE SAINT PETERSBURG CONSERVATOIRE 
HE'D PROVED HIMSELF AN ENFANT TERRIBLE 
WITH HIS FIRST PIANO CONCERTO 
WHICH SOME CRITICS SAID WAS THE WORK OF THE DEVIL 
HE REJECTED THE LANGUAGE OF HIS PREVIOUS TEACHERS 
AND DECIDED FOR THE SECOND PIANO CONCERTO HE WAS GOING TO WRITE A WORK OF GREAT DEPTH 
IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THIS CONCERTO WAS PREMIERED FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE RITE OF SPRING 
THIS IS NINETEEN THIRTEEN SO THIS IS A YEAR OF SCANDAL 
AND PROKOFIEV UNLIKE TCHAIKOVSKY LOVED TO OFFEND 
AND IT CAUSED QUITE A STINK AT ITS PREMIERE 
I THINK IT WAS AT A FESTIVAL IT WAS HAPPENING 
EVERYBODY WAS EXPECTING A NICE BIT OF ENTERTAINMENT 
AND INSTEAD THEY GOT THIS UNCOMPROMISING PIECE 
BUT THE THING ABOUT PROKOFIEV'S ENFANT TERRIBLENESS 
AND THE DISSONANCE GREAT VOLLEYS OF DISSONANCE YOU HEAR IN THE HUGE CADENZA 
WHICH IS MARKED COLOSSALE I THINK COLOSSALLY 
HUGE FISTFULS OF NOTES 
IT'S DELIBERATELY SHOWY MUSIC I MEAN IT'S SHOW OFF MUSIC ACTUALLY 
PROKOFIEV IS SAYING I CAN CREATE THESE APPARENTLY BARBARIC NOISES 
AND YOU JUST HAVE TO LISTEN HE'S VERY MUCH POSITIONING HIMSELF AS A RADICAL COMPOSER AND PIANIST 
HE WAS DELIBERATELY SETTING OUT TO SHOCK AND OFFEND 
THE TRUTH IS THAT THE DISSONANCES ARE SIMPLY A COLOUR 
UNDERNEATH HE'S A TRADITIONALIST 
AND THIS IS THE LANGUAGE OF GLINKA GLIERE BORODIN IN TRUTH 
JUST GIVE US A BIT ON THE STRUCTURE TOM 
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE TRADITIONAL ORDER AND THE CADENZAS ARE IMPORTANT 
THE BIG ONE IN THE FIRST AND IN THE FINALE THERE ARE FOUR MOVEMENTS 
AND IT STARTS WITH AN ANDANTE WHICH LULLS YOU REALLY 
AT THAT FIRST PERFORMANCE INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY 
IT STARTS WITH A NURSERY LIKE TUNE LIKE THE TUNES FROM THE SEVENTH SYMPHONY AT THE END OF HIS CAREER 
BUT THEN FIVE MINUTES IN THINGS SUDDENLY START GETTING GOING 
AND IT CREATES TERRIFIC ENERGY VERY LONG CADENZA AND THEN A HUGE VIOLENT CLIMAX 
AND THEN HILARIOUSLY HE ENDS THE FIRST MOVEMENT VERY QUIETLY NONE OF THAT REALLY HAPPENED 
THE TWO MIDDLE MOVEMENTS ARE KIND OF MECHANICAL A SCHERZO A VERY STRANGE MARCH THIRD 
AND THEN YEAH A SORT OF FINALE WHICH IS NOISE 
BUT THERE ARE RATHER TOUCHING MOMENTS 
HE DEDICATED THE PIECE TO A FRIEND WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE 
AND THERE'S A CLEAR REFLECTION OF THAT ONLY IN THE OPENING THEME 
THE REST OF IT IS OLYMPIC HARDCORE RUSSIAN GYMNAST PIANISM OF THE FIRST ORDER 
THIS IS A PIECE THAT IS WRITTEN TO REALLY DISPLAY HIS TALENTS TO THE FULL 
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THE SHEER LEVEL OF VIRTUOSITY THAT THIS PIECE REQUIRES 
PROKOFIEV HIMSELF SAID HE WAS NERVOUS ABOUT THE COLOSSALE CADENZA THAT TOM JUST MENTIONED 
AND THE SCHERZO THERE'S TWO AND A HALF CONTINUOUS MINUTES 
OF RUNNING SEMI QUAVERS IN OCTAVES ON THE PIANO 
THAT MEANS I READ SOMEWHERE THAT IT'S SOMETHING LIKE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NOTES PER HAND 
AND IT'S JUST A FORMIDABLE FEAT OF CONCENTRATION 
AND HE USED TO GET TERRIBLY TENSE HIMSELF ABOUT PERFORMING THIS 
AND REALISED THAT IF HE STOPPED PLAYING IT LET IT SLIP OUT OF HIS REPERTOIRE THAT WAS IT 
IT'S NOT A PIECE YOU CAN EASILY COME BACK TO ABSOLUTELY 
AND IT'S ALSO I THINK FOR TORADZE TONIGHT'S PIANIST 
HE'S NEVER GIVEN HIMSELF THE CHANCE TO FORGET IT HE'S MADE HIS NAME WITH PROKOFIEV CONCERTOS 
RECORDED THEM ALL WITH GERGIEV AS WELL 
HE'S A PROKOFIEV PIANIST PAR EXCELLENCE 
IT'S STILL YOU'VE GOT TO BE 
WHOEVER YOU ARE WHEN YOU'VE GOT TO PLAY THIS MUSIC 
YOU'RE STILL GOING TO BE NERVOUS ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE THE CHOPS TO GET THROUGH IT 
IT'S TERRIFYING LET'S TALK A BIT ABOUT TORADZE 
I'VE SEEN HIM WORKING WITH GERGIEV THEY'VE WORKED WITH THE L. S. O. BEFORE 
HE'S ALSO WORKED WITH GIANANDREA NOSEDA GERGIEV'S PROTEGE 
WHO RUNS THE B. B. C. PHILHARMONIC IN MANCHESTER 
HE'S KIND OF QUITE A BRUTE OF A FELLOW ISN'T HE YEAH 
BOTH AS A PERSON AND AT THE KEYBOARD 
PIANOS OFTEN DON'T SURVIVE HE'S OF THE RUSSIAN TRUCK DRIVING SCHOOL OF PIANISM 
AND WE'RE GOING TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT HE'S PERFECT FOR THE JOB 
THEIR PARTNERSHIP IS INTERESTING 
I SAW THEM DO PROBABLY THE WORST MUSICAL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE 
SEEING HIM DO RACHMANINOFF'S SECOND PIANO CONCERTO COMPLETE DISASTER 
THE TEMPOS WERE ALL OVER THE PLACE THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEM AND THE ORCHESTRA 
THIS IS THE MAGIC WHEN IT WORKS IT REALLY WORKS WHEN IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T 
AND THEY'RE BOTH PREPARED TO TAKE RISKS SO SEE IF THEY PAY OFF 
I WAS LOOKING AROUND ON STAGE EARLIER ON 
AND THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF CARPET THAT'S PLACED UNDERNEATH THE PEDALS 
BECAUSE APPARENTLY TORADZE LIKES TO STAMP 
IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW MUCH STAMPING HAPPENS HERE HE COMES 
ALEXANDER TORADZE WITH VALERY GERGIEV 
TO JOIN THE LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA 
IN PROKOFIEV'S SECOND PIANO CONCERTO 
WELL I CAN TELL YOU WHAT THAT'S A PERFORMANCE I WILL NEVER FORGET 
PROKOFIEV'S SECOND PIANO CONCERTO PLAYED BY ALEXANDER TORADZE 
THE LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA CONDUCTED HERE AT THE PROMS 
BY VALERY GERGIEV 
WELL I HOPE THAT THE PIANO GETS A LITTLE TENDER LOVING CARE FROM A TECHNICIAN 
BEFORE IT GRACES THE STAGE OF THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL AGAIN 
ALEXANDER TORADZE TELLING US EARLIER ON 
THAT FOR HIM THIS CONCERTO IS UNASHAMEDLY OPEN HEART SURGERY 
NO HE WENT ON IT'S MORE LIKE OPEN SOUL SURGERY 
ABOUT PROKOFIEV'S FRIEND AND OLDER BROTHER FIGURE MAX SCHMIDTHOF 
WHO DIED TRAGICALLY EARLY 
TORADZE ALSO SAID THAT IN NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR WHEN PROKOFIEV WAS REVISING THIS CONCERTO 
HE WAS INCREDIBLY HOMESICK AND WAS RECORDING HIS YOUTH 
SUCKING MEMORIES FOR EVERY SOURCE OF HIS EARLY SPIRIT HE COULD FIND 
NO DOUBT THAT TORADZE IS AN INCREDIBLE SHOWMAN 
IT WAS PROKOFIEV HIMSELF WHO PREMIERED THIS PIECE 
HE WAS AN ASTONISHING PIANIST 
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MUSIC HE COMPOSED FOR THE INSTRUMENT 
ONE OF THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY PIANO REPERTOIRE 
INCLUDING FIVE COMPLETED PIANO CONCERTOS 
REALLY A VERY CLOSE BOND BETWEEN THESE TWO ARTISTS 
AS I SAY GREAT FRIENDS 
AS WELL AS COLLEAGUES 
THEY'VE PERFORMED THE RUSSIAN REPERTOIRE TOGETHER ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS 
WE HAVE ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE THE SECOND HALF OF TONIGHT'S CONCERT 
WHEN WE'LL HEAR MORE FROM PROKOFIEV HIS SEVENTH AND FINAL SYMPHONY 
AND TCHAIKOVSKY'S FANTASY OVERTURE HAMLET HIS LAST WORK INSPIRED BY THE DRAMA OF SHAKESPEARE 
IN A MOMENT ANGELLICA BELL WILL BE BACKSTAGE CATCHING UP WITH VALERY GERGIEV 
MY NEXT GUEST 
IS THE MAN WHO AFTER A DECADE IN CHARGE OF THE PROMS HEADS OFF FOR PASTURES NEW AFTER THE LAST NIGHT 
THE OUTGOING DIRECTOR NICHOLAS KENYON HELLO 
LET'S START WITH A TRICKY QUESTION BUT I'M INTERESTED TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSE TO IT 
HOW HAVE THE PROMS ADVANCED UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP 
WELL THEY'VE DEVELOPED THEY'VE REFLECTED CHANGING TASTE IN THE AUDIENCE 
IN TERMS OF THE SORT OF MUSIC WE INCLUDE 
THEY'VE ALSO DEVELOPED BECAUSE OF THE WAY PEOPLE COME IN TO MUSIC THESE DAYS 
MAYBE A GENERATION AGO THERE WAS A FEELING THAT KIDS CAME ORGANICALLY INTO CLASSICAL MUSIC 
WITH BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND COUSINS AND AUNTS 
WE HAVE MADE A DETERMINED ATTEMPT TO GO OUT AND ATTRACT YOUNG PERFORMERS AND YOUNG LISTENERS IN TO THE PROMS 
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN VERY DISTINCTIVE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS 
SO YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR AUDIENCES NOW YES DOES THAT COME OUT 
OF A SENSE OF CONCERN PERHAPS RATHER THAN PANIC 
ABOUT WHERE THE NEXT GENERATION IT COMES OUT OF STARTING FROM WHERE THEY ARE 
SOMETHING LIKE THE BLUE PETER PROMS FOR INSTANCE HAVE ENABLED A WHOLE NEW GENERATION OF KIDS 
WITH THEIR FAMILIES TO COME TO CONCERTS OF CLASSICAL MUSIC 
WITH SHORT PIECES SHARPLY PRESENTED GOOD LIGHTING 
AND HOPEFULLY THEN MOVING ON INTO OTHER PROMS 
WE KNOW THAT YOUR RING CYCLE ENDED THIS SEASON 
WHEN YOU WERE PLANNING THIS SEASON WAS THERE A SENSE THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE THE LAST 
WERE YOU LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY NO OVER WHAT YOU'D DONE AND WHAT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO DO BEFORE YOU WENT 
NO ABSOLUTELY NOT THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE DONE IN THE FUTURE 
AND IT WAS ONLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS YEAR 
THAT THE WHOLE SCENARIO CAME UP THAT I WOULD LEAVE 
SO NO ABSOLUTELY THIS WAS NOT PLANNED AS A RETROSPECTIVE SEASON IN ANY SENSE 
AND I THINK IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT 
THE RING CYCLE HAS BEEN A WONDERFUL CULMINATION OF A PARTICULAR STRAND OF ACTIVITY 
IF YOU LOOK BACK TO WILLIAM GLOCK HE STARTED TO INTRODUCE OPERA HERE AT THE PROMS 
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO INTRODUCE AN INCREDIBLE RANGE OF OPERA IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT 
FROM BERG'S LULU SZYMANOWSKI'S KING ROGER RAMEAU HANDEL 
IT'S BEEN A WONDERFUL STRAND AND THE RING CYCLE HAS REALLY BEEN A CULMINATION OF THAT 
PLENTY OF NEW COMMISSIONS AS EVER THIS YEAR BRETT DEAN RICHARD RODNEY BENNETT 
ESA PEKKA SALONEN YOU'VE BEEN CRITICISED THOUGH FOR GHETTOISING NEW MUSIC 
FOR HIDING IT AWAY YES I THINK THAT'S COMPLETELY ABSURD 
WHEN YOU THINK THAT BECAUSE WE PERFORM PREMIERES 
IN THE EARLY EVENING PROMS NIGHT AFTER NIGHT 
IF YOU LOOK OVER THE SEASON THERE'S A REMARKABLE RANGE OF NEW MUSIC 
I THINK THOSE PEOPLE WHO WRITE ABOUT US GHETTOISING CONTEMPORARY MUSIC BY PUTTING IT IN THE LATE NIGHT PROMS 
MISUNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE PROMS ARE ABOUT 
THEY ARE PROMS FOR ENSEMBLE PIECES 
LIKE THE BOULEZ AND BIRTWISTLE PIECES THAT WE HAVE DONE THIS YEAR 
WHEN BOULEZ AND BIRTWISTLE WRITE ORCHESTRAL WORKS WE PUT THEM IN THE EARLY EVENING ORCHESTRAL PROMS 
IT'S A DIFFERENCE IN KIND NOT OF SUBSTANCE BUT IS THERE A SENSE OF GREATER CAUTION THESE DAYS 
YOU REPRISED PANIC THIS YEAR 
PANIC WAS DONE ON THE LAST NIGHT THE FIRST TIME ROUND THIS TIME IT WAS IN A LATE NIGHT PROM 
WITH A MUCH SMALLER AUDIENCE WELL THERE WERE ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE THERE WHO REALLY WANTED TO LISTEN TO IT 
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT OUR INNOVATIONS 
CAN'T BE THE SAME INNOVATIONS AS THOSE OF THE PREVIOUS GENERATION 
AND THAT'S WHY THE THINGS THAT I COUNT AS OUR INNOVATIONS 
ARE THINGS LIKE THE MASSIVE PIECE BY PETER WIEGOLD THAT HE CREATED FOR OUR BRASS DAY 
BRINGING UZBEK TRUMPETERS AND THE COLDSTREAM GUARDS 
AND YOUNG PERFORMERS AND A PROFESSIONAL ORCHESTRA TOGETHER IN A COMPLETELY UNIQUE COMBINATION 
SO THOSE ARE THE SORT OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS 
THAT WE HAVE BEEN INNOVATING WITH OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS 
DO YOU THINK THERE'S A SENSE THAT PERHAPS AUDIENCES AREN'T SEARCHING 
FOR THE SHOCK OF THE NEW SO MUCH NOW 
WELL IF YOU THINK BACK TO HENRY WOOD 
INTRODUCING SCHOENBERG AND IT BEING GREETED BY HISSES 
PETER MAXWELL DAVIES WHO'S TOLD ME 
HE USED TO TAKE PLEASURE FROM THE SOUND OF CHAIRS GOING UP 
AS PEOPLE WALKED OUT NOWADAYS 
WELL MAYBE WE WANT THINGS SAFER IT'S GENEROUS OF HIM TO SAY THAT 
I WONDER IF HE REALLY DID FEEL LIKE THAT WHEN IT WAS HAPPENING IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OWN PIECE 
I THINK THE PROMS HAS ALWAYS THRIVED ON MIXED PROGRAMMING 
TAKE TONIGHT A PACKED ARENA HERE PEOPLE MAYBE DRAWN BY TCHAIKOVSKY 
BUT WILLING TO EXPERIMENT WITH PROKOFIEV 
IT'S INCREDIBLE TO THINK THAT PROKOFIEV HADN'T REACHED THIS COUNTRY 
THAT PIECE WE JUST HEARD BEFORE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES SO I THINK 
IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE SAME YEAR THAT SCHOENBERG'S FIVE PIECES WERE PREMIERED AT THE PROMS ABSOLUTELY 
THE BEST OF CONTEMPORARY MUSIC DOES GET A HEARING AT THE PROMS 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT CERTAIN OF THOSE WHO COMMENT ABOUT THE CONTEMPORARY MUSIC THAT IS AT THE PROMS 
HAVE A VERY LIMITED IDEA OF WHAT CONTEMPORARY MUSIC IS 
WHEN YOU'RE IN A WORLD THAT INCLUDES JOHN ADAMS AND NITIN SAWHNEY 
AND ESA PEKKA SALONEN AS GREAT FIGURES IN CONTEMPORARY MUSIC 
WE NEED TO BE AS OPEN MINDED AS THE PROMS AUDIENCE HAS PROVED TO BE 
VERY BRIEF RESPONSE TO LAST NIGHT'S PROM MICHAEL BALL 
ONE VIEWER DESPAIRS THAT A PROM HAS BEEN WASTED ON THIS GARBAGE 
ANOTHER WROTE I'M A CLASSICAL MUSIC FAN BUT HAVE BEEN ENTHRALLED FOR THE PAST TWO HOURS 
DID YOU ENJOY IT I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT I'M REALLY PLEASED THAT WE DID IT 
AND THOSE BROADWAY TUNES 
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE PROMS TWENTY YEARS AGO 
WOULD NOT HAVE EXPECTED TO INCLUDE GERSHWIN OR BERNSTEIN 
AND HERE WE ARE EXPANDING THE REPERTORY 
I THINK THE QUESTION IS HOW FAR CAN THE PROMS REPERTORY EXPAND AND IN WHAT DIRECTION 
GEORGINA BORN WAS SAYING SOME VERY INTERESTING THINGS HERE ON SUNDAY ABOUT THAT 
HAVE YOU GOT A HIGHLIGHT SO FAR 
UM WELL I THINK THE VENEZUELAN YOUTH ORCHESTRA WAS SUCH A UNIQUE OCCASION 
THAT IN ANYBODY'S BOOK IT HAS TO BE A HIGHLIGHT 
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY GREAT PROMS THIS YEAR 
FROM GOTTERDAMMERUNG TO THE LUCERNE FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA WITH CLAUDIO ABBADO 
AND THE LATE NIGHT CONCERT OF BOULEZ AND BIRTWISTLE WHICH WAS OUTSTANDING 
LET ME FINISH WITH A QUOTATION AND ASK FOR YOUR RESPONSE I'M HANDING ON A SACRED TRUST 
IF YOU BETRAY IT I WILL PERSONALLY COME ROUND AND THROTTLE YOU THAT SOUNDS LIKE JEREMY ISAACS 
TALKING TO MICHAEL GRADE DO YOU HAVE A MESSAGE FOR ROGER WRIGHT MY MESSAGE IS ENJOY IT 
WE ARE LEAVING THE PROMS IN AS GOOD A SHAPE AS THEY CAN POSSIBLY BE 
THEY ARE AN INCREDIBLY THRIVING INSTITUTION MAKE THE MOST OF IT 
SO NO THROTTLING REQUIRED NICHOLAS KENYON THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU PETROC 
LET'S GO AND JOIN ANGELLICA BELL NOW 
THANK YOU PETROC 
I'M IN THE GREEN ROOM AND I'M JOINED BY VALERY GERGIEV THE CONDUCTOR OF TONIGHT'S PROM 
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU THANK YOU WONDERFUL FIRST HALF DID YOU ENJOY IT 
I'M ENJOYING IT GOOD GOOD 
NOW YOU TOOK OVER AS PRINCIPAL CONDUCTOR OF THE L. S. O. IN JANUARY AND YOU CLEARLY ENJOY WORKING WITH THEM 
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THEM TO WORK WITH IT'S THE FIRST ORCHESTRA I CONDUCTED IN LONDON 
IT'S THE FIRST ORCHESTRA I RECORDED WITH ON A MAJOR LABEL LONG AGO 
THEN I HAD MORE EXPERIENCE AND WHEN WE WORKED ON THE PROKOFIEV CYCLE ALL THE SYMPHONIES WE PERFORMED 
I FELT IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE ATMOSPHERE 
WHICH WAS REALLY A MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR ME TO GO THROUGH 
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS THERE AND THE ORCHESTRA IS WONDERFUL GREAT ARTISTS GREAT PEOPLE 
YOU CLEARLY PRODUCED THAT ATMOSPHERE TONIGHT 
THE PROGRAMME OF MUSIC THIS EVENING IS FROM RUSSIA YOUR HOMELAND 
DO YOU THINK RUSSIAN ORCHESTRAS ARE MORE INTUITIVE WITH THIS MUSIC 
OR IS IT JUST ABOUT FEELING AND BELIEVING IT 
BOTH TCHAIKOVSKY AND PROKOFIEV WERE RUSSIANS 
BUT ALSO THEY HUGELY RESPECTED AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY KNEW 
A LOT ABOUT EUROPEAN TRADITION 
SO THEY CAN EASILY PRODUCE SOUND SONORITY AND ALSO ATMOSPHERE 
WHICH WILL BE VERY RUSSIAN AND AT THE SAME TIME ENOUGH EUROPEAN ENOUGH CONTINENTAL SO TO SAY 
SO I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY EASY TO SAY THAT A GREAT LONDON ORCHESTRA 
CAN BE AS GOOD AS ANY RUSSIAN ORCHESTRA 
I'M ENJOYING WORKING WITH BOTH A RUSSIAN AND A LONDON ORCHESTRA NOW 
THESE ARE TWO PRIORITIES IN MY LIFE AND I'M VERY VERY FOCUSED ON IT 
YOU TALK ABOUT EUROPEAN INFLUENCES I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE TCHAIKOVSKY PIECES BEING PLAYED TONIGHT 
THEY ARE LINKED TO SHAKESPEARE PLAYS 
WHAT ROLE DOES SHAKESPEARE PLAY IN RUSSIAN CULTURE BIG BIG 
PUSHKIN SHAKESPEARE VERY BIG 
TCHAIKOVSKY COULD FIND A RUSSIAN STORY BUT YOU SEE ROMEO AND JULIET AND THEN HAMLET 
SO HE WAS REALLY EXCITED TO WORK ON STUFF LIKE THIS 
THE INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY FOR A MUSICIAN TO JOIN FORCES WITH SUCH A GREAT MAN OF THE PAST 
IS SOMETHING THAT BOTH TCHAIKOVSKY AND PROKOFIEV ENJOYED LOOK AT PROKOFIEV'S ROMEO AND JULIET AS WELL 
AN UNBELIEVABLE SCORE ROMEO AND JULIET HAMLET FANTASTIC SHAKESPEARE PLAYS 
AND LIKE YOU SAID VERY PASSIONATE 
WHY HAS THE FANTASY OVERTURE FOR ROMEO AND JULIET 
MAINTAINED ITS PLACE IN THE REPERTOIRE MORE THAN HAMLET 
IT'S NOT AS WELL KNOWN IS IT 
IT'S AN UNBELIEVABLY INSPIRED WORK ROMEO AND JULIET 
IT'S SO MUCH ABOUT THE BEAUTY MUSIC CAN BRING INTO OUR LIFE 
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES 
FROM THE FIRST PAGE TO THE LAST IT IS TOTALLY INSPIRED 
AND WHEN GREAT COMPOSERS ARE INSPIRED YOU HAVE SOME GREAT GREAT RESULTS 
I THINK THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO JUST CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING ELSE 
BUT THE POWER AND BEAUTY OF THIS MUSIC 
TCHAIKOVSKY REALLY CAN TOUCH THE HEART 
AND HE CONTINUES THIS LINE OF MOZART YOU KNOW AND BEETHOVEN 
THE REAL CLASSICAL LIST 
AND WHY CLASSICAL BECAUSE IT'S NOT FOR TWO FIVE TEN PEOPLE 
WHO SAY I LIKE THIS DETAIL IT'S INTELLECTUALLY VERY ENTERTAINING 
NO IT'S FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THEY ARE JUST TAKEN I LOVE MYSELF THIS OVERTURE FANTASY 
AND I THINK IT IS GREAT TO HAVE IT AT THE PROMS BRILLIANT 
WE'VE JUST HEARD PROKOFIEV'S PIANO CONCERTO NO TWO PERFORMED BY ALEXANDER A GREAT FRIEND OF YOURS 
WHAT IS IT ABOUT HIM THAT MAKES HIM SO UNIQUE TO WORK WITH 
AND FIND SOMETHING THAT MAKES MUSIC SOUND LESS CONVENTIONAL 
WE NEED ARTISTS LIKE ALEXANDER TORADZE BECAUSE IT WILL BE NOT GOOD FOR CLASSICAL MUSIC 
IF EVERYONE TRIES TO PLAY THE WAY MUSIC WAS RECORDED LAST TIME 
OR THE WAY IT WAS DESCRIBED ONCE AS THIS IS THE ONLY WAY 
AND I'M TALKING EVEN ABOUT SYMPHONIES OF BEETHOVEN OR OPERAS OF PUCCINI 
SO VERY VERY VERY POPULAR 
WE NEED DIFFERENT ARTISTS AS WE NEED DIFFERENT ORCHESTRAS WE NEED DIFFERENT CONDUCTORS 
EVERYONE IS FREE TO EXPRESS HIS MAYBE EVEN EXTREMELY DIFFERENT VIEW 
DIFFERENT FROM MANY OTHER CONVENTIONAL 
EVEN CONVENTIONAL VIEWS ARE VERY IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE THEY ALSO KEEP WHAT WE CALL TRADITION MORE OR LESS A CERTAIN SHAPE 
AND THEN SOMEONE COMES AND GIVES YOU A TOTALLY DIFFERENT READING 
AND THEN YOU THINK OH THIS IS MAYBE EVEN MORE INTERESTING SO IT MAKES YOU THINK 
IT MAKES YOU FEEL THAT MUSIC IS ALIVE 
YOU KNOW A BODY ALWAYS CONTINUES TO CHANGE 
AND THIS IS WHAT I THINK HAPPENS TO GREAT SYMPHONIES GREAT CONCERTI 
WRITTEN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO OR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO 
THEY CAN CHANGE BECAUSE OUR GENERATION AND THEN THE NEXT GENERATIONS WILL BRING SOMETHING NEW 
IS THAT WHAT YOU'VE TRIED TO DO IN THE MARIINSKY THEATRE PUT THAT MUSIC AND THAT PASSION INTO THAT 
WELL AT MARIINSKY I HAVE TO DO MANY THINGS AND ONE OF THEM IS JUST SIMPLY TO MAKE SURE 
THAT WE DO NOT FORGET THAT WE ARE A GREAT RUSSIAN MUSICAL INSTITUTION 
THERE IS A HUGE TRADITION 
THIS TRADITION HAS TO NOT ONLY SURVIVE 
THERE'S NO DOUBT IT HAS SURVIVED ALREADY ALL THE DIFFICULT YEARS 
BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE FOR MANY MANY MANY CENTURIES TO COME 
AND MY TIME AT THE MARIINSKY WHICH IS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS ALREADY 
WAS FULL OF WORK DEDICATED TO PROKOFIEV STRAVINSKY SHOSTAKOVICH 
AND OF COURSE EVEN TCHAIKOVSKY GLINKA BORODIN RIMSKY KORSAKOV 
THEY HAVE TO BE IF I MAY SAY REVISITED AS REGULARLY AS POSSIBLE 
EXCELLENT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO US A PLEASURE FOR ME 
GOOD LUCK WITH THE SECOND HALF BACK TO YOU 
ANGELLICA THANK YOU VERY MUCH ZOE MARTLEW AND TOM SERVICE ARE BACK WITH ME 
LET'S START WITH ALEXANDER TORADZE'S PERFORMANCE OF THE PROKOFIEV 
AT TIMES TO ME IT SEEMED THAT HE WASN'T JUST PLAYING THE PIANO 
HE WAS WORKING IN A SOVIET FACTORY 
THIS IS POWER PLAYING OF THE FIRST KIND HEAVY MECHANICAL PLAYING 
WHAT WAS EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT THAT PERFORMANCE WAS HOW SLOW THE TEMPI WERE 
THIS IS A CONCERTO WHICH HAS NO SLOW MOVEMENT 
IT LACKS A SLOW MOVEMENT THE FIRST MOVEMENT WAS MORE LIKE AN ADAGIO 
AND THE FAMOUS COLOSSALE CADENZA WAS REALLY SLOW 
AND UNFORTUNATELY TORADZE COULDN'T QUITE MANAGE IT 
EVEN WITH HIS BRUTISH HANDS AT THAT SPEED THAT WAS WHAT WAS FUNNY 
IT MEANT 
I CAN SEE WHY THOUGH IT MUST BE COMPLETELY PETRIFYING 
AND IF YOU KNOW THAT'S COMING UP WHAT BETTER WAY TO MAKE IT EASIER THAN TAKE THE TEMPO DOWN A BIT 
BUT WHAT BEAUTIFUL LYRICAL PLAYING AT THE BEGINNING YEAH BEAUTIFUL 
AND IN THE FINALE WHAT ABOUT WE TALKED ABOUT HIS FORCEFULNESS 
AND WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO TO THE PIANO AND AS I SAY 
I SUSPECT THE PIANO MAY NEED SOME WORK NOW 
DID THAT TAKE IT AWAY A BIT TOM 
YEAH IT'S POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE A DIFFERENT PERFORMANCE OF THAT PIECE THAT WOULD SELL IT BETTER 
FOR ME HALF THE PROBLEM WITH THE WAY THAT MUSIC IS STRUCTURED 
IF YOU DON'T GET THE SENSE OF THE WAY THE BLOCKS RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER IT CAN SEEM EPISODIC 
AND IT SEEMED LIKE CHUNK AFTER CHUNK RATHER THAN A COMPLETE EXPERIENCE 
IT'S A PROBLEMATIC PIECE IN THAT SENSE IT'S NOT A PERFECT STRUCTURE 
BUT IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO GET A BIGGER LINE THROUGH THE THING THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE CONVINCING 
O. K. LET'S MOVE ON AND TALK ABOUT WHAT NICHOLAS KENYON WAS SAYING ABOUT THE PROMS 
HAVING HEARD FROM THE ACCUSED WE'VE GOT THE ACCUSER 
TOM SERVICE IT WAS WHO ACCUSED NICHOLAS KENYON OF GHETTOISING NEW MUSIC 
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE HE'S DONE THAT 
JUST AS YOU ASKED NICK ABOUT THAT TOO 
FOR ME THE THING IS NOT SO MUCH NICK IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT YOU CAN POINT TO A LOT OF COMMISSIONS 
FOR ME THE ISSUE IS WHAT THE PROMS DO 
DO THE PROMS EXIST TO REFLECT TASTE OR TO CHANGE IT 
NICK CAN SAY RIGHTLY THAT THERE'S MORE SHOSTAKOVICH AND PROKOFIEV THAN THERE WAS FIFTY SIXTY YEARS AGO 
BUT FOR ME NEW MUSIC IS A SORT OF FAULT LINE 
IT'S POSSIBLE TO SAY THIS IS WHAT WE BELIEVE IN AT THE PROMS WE'RE GONNA EXPOSE AN AUDIENCE TO IT 
YOU MIGHT TAKE A HIT WITH AUDIENCE FIGURES AT THE BEGINNING 
BUT YOU GIVE PEOPLE THE CHANCE TO HEAR THINGS THEY WOULDN'T OTHERWISE HEAR 
THE PROMS SHOULD BE GIVING PEOPLE THE CHANCE TO HEAR THINGS YOU CANNOT HEAR ANY OTHER WAY 
THE PROBLEM IS ISN'T IT WITH THE PROMS THAT IF YOU'RE RUNNING IT 
YOU'RE SORT OF HIT EITHER WAY 
IF YOU BRING IN NEW MUSIC YOUR AUDIENCES FALL BRING IN POPULAR STUFF AND YOU'RE DUMBING DOWN 
I THINK HE'S STRUCK A GOOD BALANCE WHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD CAN YOU WALK IN FOR A FIVER 
AND LISTEN TO THE BEST MUSICIANS PLAYING A MULTITUDE OF PIECES 
THERE IS A LOT OF NEW MUSIC 
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM AND I THINK HE'S STRUCK A GOOD BALANCE 
THERE'S A BIG DANGER IN THE FUTURE OF POSSIBLY WATERING THINGS DOWN 
BY PAYING LIP SERVICE TO TRENDIFYING THE PROMS IF YOU LIKE YEAH 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY VITAL THAT WE MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF EXCELLENCE IN CLASSICAL MUSIC 
JUST BEFORE I'M GOING TO STOP YOU THERE COS JUST BEFORE WE GET BACK TO TONIGHT'S PROM 
WE THOUGHT WE'D HAVE A LITTLE CELEBRATION ON OUR LIVE COVERAGE OF THE B. B. C. FOUR PROMS TONIGHT 
NICHOLAS KENYON HAS REFLECTED HOW HIS FAVOURITE PROM SO FAR THIS YEAR 
WAS THE NATIONAL YOUTH ORCHESTRA OF VENEZUELA 
IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY EVENING 
THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE UNDER THE DYNAMIC DIRECTORSHIP OF THEIR VERY YOUNG CONDUCTOR GUSTAVO DUDAMEL 
LET'S JUST SPEND A COUPLE OF MINUTES ENJOYING THAT EXTRAORDINARY PROM 
MAMBO 
MAMBO 
GUSTAVO DUDAMEL CONDUCTING THE SIMON BOLIVAR NATIONAL YOUTH ORCHESTRA OF VENEZUELA 
THEY ONLY PUT THOSE VENEZUELAN SHIRTS ON FOR THE ENCORES 
BUT IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY EVENING 
TOM GUSTAVO'S JUST SIGNED A CONTRACT TO BE MUSIC DIRECTOR 
OF THE LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC IT'S A STANDARD ARRANGEMENT 
HE'LL DO FIFTEEN WEEKS A YEAR 
HERE WE ARE WITH VALERY GERGIEV TWELVE CONCERTS A YEAR WITH THE L. S. O. 
IS HE REALLY THEIR MUSIC DIRECTOR FOR ME THAT'S A BIG QUESTION 
THEY'RE TAKING A BIG RISK WITH THE APPOINTMENT TO SEE HOW IT WORKS OUT 
THEY WILL HAVE TAKEN A GAMBLE SAYING GERGIEV IS A BIG NAME 
WE'RE GOING TO GET TWELVE OUTSTANDING CONCERTS TWELVE EXCITING MUSICAL OCCASIONS 
BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A MUSIC DIRECTOR FIGURE 
LIKE A MUSIC DIRECTOR IN AMERICA WHERE YOU HAVE TO BE AT THE HELM OF THE ORCHESTRA 
NOT JUST ON THE PODIUM BUT IN RELATION TO AUDIENCES AND SPONSORS 
GERGIEV SIMPLY CANNOT HAVE THAT ROLE IN LONDON 
COS HE'S GOT THE JOB IN ROTTERDAM 
IT'S GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT SORT OF THING I'M SURE THE ORCHESTRA HAS A STRONG ENOUGH SOUND AND IDENTITY 
THAT THEY'LL BE CARRIED THROUGH THAT BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT 
IT'S NOT A CONVENTIONAL MUSIC DIRECTOR RELATIONSHIP 
AND AS A PLAYER HOW EASY WILL IT BE FOR HIM TO BUILD THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS BAND 
IT'S VERY TOUGH TOM'S RIGHT 
THE ORCHESTRA HAS SUCH A STRONG IDENTITY IT WILL PULL THROUGH REGARDLESS 
BUT ONE THING HE DOES BRING TO THEM I NOTICED IN THE TCHAIKOVSKY HE'S USING RUSSIAN BOWINGS 
THEY'RE USING A DIFFERENT STYLE OF VIBRATO THAN I'VE SEEN BEFORE 
THIS SOUND IS DIFFERENT IN THE STRINGS SO THERE ARE CHANGES 
HE'S VERY TOUGH WHAT DO YOU MEAN RUSSIAN BOWINGS INSTEAD OF 
HE'S DOING LOTS OF SWEEPS IN UP BOWS 
AND HE'S RETAKING WITH LOTS OF IT'S ACTUALLY OPPOSITE 
SO THE ATTACK AND ARTICULATION IS DIFFERENT 
IT'S A HARDER FRONT TO THE NOTE AND A DIFFERENT FORM OF EXPRESSION 
ISN'T IT THE SORT OF THING THE FUNNY THING ABOUT THIS IS 
HOW WOULD WE FEEL IF WE WERE WATCHING THE MARIINSKY BAND WHO PRODUCE AN AUTHENTIC RUSSIAN SOUND 
WHY NOT JUST HEAR THEM YEAH 
IT'S A QUESTION IF HE'S GOING TO DO THIS REP AS WELL WITH THE L. S. O. 
WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO DIFFERENTLY THAT HE'S NOT DOING WITH MARIINSKY 
ANOTHER POINT IS HE'S A REAL SEAT OF THE PANTS MAN 
BUT ACTUALLY HE PACKS IN SO MUCH WORK YOU MET HIM OFF THE PLANE FROM LOUISIANA THERE'S NO QUESTION 
I PUT THIS QUESTION TO HIM SOMEWHAT TREPIDACIOUSLY 
MR. GERGIEV HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY HAVE TIME TO REHEARSE THINGS PROPERLY 
WHEN HE'D JUST FLOWN IN FROM LOS ANGELES THAT DAY 
AND HE WAS MIDWAY THROUGH A SHOSTAKOVIC CYCLE AT THE BARBICAN 
WHEN HE LOOKS YOU IN THE EYE YOU UNDERSTAND THIS SORT OF FERAL CHARISMA WE JUST SAW IT 
HE SAID NOBODY CAN ACCUSE ME OF NOT REHEARSING ENOUGH 
THE WORK HE DOES IS INCREDIBLY DETAILED AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THE RESULTS HE GETS ARE EXTRAORDINARY 
WE HAVE ANOTHER HALF OF THE CONCERT TO TALK ABOUT 
IT STARTS WITH TCHAIKOVSKY'S HAMLET 
THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT TAKE ON SHAKESPEARE TO ROMEO AND JULIET 
YES IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
THE IDEA OF FATE IS SOMETHING THAT FLOWS THROUGH ALL OF HIS SYMPHONIC TONE POEMS 
SO WE HEARD IT IN ROMEO AND JULIET BUT ALSO IN THE TEMPEST AND FRANCESCA DI RIMINI 
THIS IDEA THAT FATE IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY SUITS SHAKESPEARIAN DRAMA 
AND THE FATE RIDDEN HERO OF HAMLET REALLY SUITS HIS PARTICULAR STYLE 
BUT IT'S NOT A PROGRAMMATIC DEPICTION IN THE WAY THAT ROMEO AND JULIET IS 
THIS PIECE ISN'T WORKING LIKE THAT IT'S MUCH MORE ABOUT THE POETIC IDEA OF FATE 
THIS IS A PIECE THAT HENRY WOOD CONDUCTED TWENTY TIMES BETWEEN NINETEEN OH FOUR AND NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE 
THE LAST TIME IT WAS PLAYED HERE WAS NINETEEN EIGHTY HAMLET IS HARDLY DONE 
IT'S BEEN ECLIPSED BY ROMEO AND JULIET WHICH IS DONE ALL THE TIME 
BUT IT'S WRITTEN AT THE SAME TIME AS THE FIFTH SYMPHONY SO IT'S RIGHT UP THERE WITH TCHAIKOVSKY'S GREATEST 
DO YOU THINK THE TORTURED TCHAIKOVSKY SAW A BIT OF HIMSELF IN HAMLET 
WELL AGAIN THE SENSE OF PHILOSOPHICAL DESPAIR 
AND TRAGEDY IS NEVER FAR FROM TCHAIKOVSKY'S MUSIC 
YOU ALWAYS HEAR A SENSE OF MELANCHOLY IN WHAT HE DOES 
AND THIS PIECE IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM ROMEO AND JULIET 
IN THE SENSE THAT YOU HEAR DARKER SOUNDS IT'S THEMATICALLY MORE COMPLEX 
THINGS AREN'T DEVELOPED IN THE SAME WAY IT MOVES AWAY FROM SONATA FORM 
SO YES 
WELL FROM MAMBO PLAYED BY THE VENEZUELANS TO THIS 
TO PURCELL'S OPERA BASED ON THE TEMPEST 
WHY HAS SHAKESPEARE PROVIDED THIS EXTRAORDINARY INSPIRATION 
WELL SHAKESPEARE IS A KIND OF FORCE OF NATURE IN CULTURE THAT PEOPLE WANT TO RESPOND TO 
THE WAY TCHAIKOVSKY MAKES THIS AND TAKES THE THEME 
MAKES THIS PIECE IT'S HIS PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION WITH THE STORY 
VALERY GERGIEV CONDUCTS THE L. S. O. 
TCHAIKOVSKY'S FANTASY OVERTURE HAMLET 
PERFORMED BY THE LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA 
CONDUCTED BY VALERY GERGIEV 
WE HAVE A QUICK RESET NOW 
BEFORE PROKOFIEV'S SEVENTH AND LAST SYMPHONY 
WHICH TAKES US INTO A VERY DIFFERENT WORLD FROM THE SECOND PIANO CONCERTO 
THAT WE HEARD EARLIER ON 
A TURN AWAY FROM SOME OF THE MORE DISSONANT ASPECTS OF HIS MUSIC 
TO A RATHER SIMPLER STYLE 
HE COMPLETED THE SYMPHONY IN NINETEEN FIFTY TWO FOR REDUCED ORCHESTRAL FORCES 
AND IT WAS PREMIERED AS PART OF A RADIO PROGRAMME FOR CHILDREN 
MOST OF THE SYMPHONY IS EMOTIONALLY RESTRAINED 
RATHER NOSTALGIC MELANCHOLIC IN ITS MOOD 
IT WAS BILLED AS A WHIMSICALLY EVOCATIVE PORTRAIT OF HIS CHILDHOOD 
BUT THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING RATHER DARKER GOING ON BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WORK 
HARDLY SURPRISING GIVEN THE TUMULTUOUS POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE IN SOVIET RUSSIA AT THE TIME 
IT WAS A PERIOD OF INCREASING CULTURAL REPRESSION 
JUST FOUR YEARS EARLIER 
PROKOFIEV ALONG WITH SHOSTAKOVICH AND KHACHATURIAN 
HAD BEEN DENOUNCED BY STALIN AS BEING TOO COSMOPOLITAN AND FORMALIST 
THE EFFECT ON PROKOFIEV ALREADY WEAK AND IN POOR HEALTH 
WAS DEVASTATINGLY DEMORALISING 
TO APPEASE THE REGIME 
PROKOFIEV LITERALLY CHURNED OUT A SERIES OF UNREMARKABLE 
BUT HIGHLY PATRIOTIC WORKS 
WELL HE DID STILL MANAGE TO COMPOSE SOME WORKS OF IMPORT 
THIS SYMPHONY A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE WRITTEN THE YEAR BEFORE HIS DEATH 
IT WAS HIS LAST SYMPHONY AND THE PREMIER OF THE WORK WAS ALSO PROKOFIEV'S LAST PUBLIC APPEARANCE 
HE WAS POSTHUMOUSLY AWARDED THE LENIN PRIZE IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN FOR THIS SYMPHONY 
AS I SAY HIS LAST WORK WRITTEN THE YEAR BEFORE HIS DEATH 
AFTER THE TURMOIL CAUSED BY THE STALINIST REGIME IN PROKOFIEV'S LIFETIME 
HIS END WAS IRONIC HE DIED ON THE VERY SAME DAY AS STALIN 
MARCH FIFTH NINETEEN FIFTY THREE HIS DEATH WENT UNPUBLISHED AND UNKNOWN TO ANYONE BUT CLOSE FRIENDS FOR DAYS 
AND WHEN IT DID BECOME NEWS 
THERE WERE NO FLOWERS AVAILABLE TO LAY AT PROKOFIEV'S GRAVE 
THEY'D ALL BEEN TAKEN FOR STALIN'S DEMISE 
ONLY ABOUT FORTY PEOPLE ABLE TO ATTEND THE CIVIL FUNERAL FOR PROKOFIEV AT THE COMPOSER'S UNION 
EXCESSIVE STATE ORDERED MOURNING AFTER STALIN'S DEATH 
CASTING A FINAL AND DISGRACEFUL SHADOW OVER PROKOFIEV 
SO COMING ONTO THE STAGE FOR THE LAST TIME THIS EVENING 
VALERY GERGIEV TO CONDUCT THE LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA IN PROKOFIEV'S SEVENTH SYMPHONY 
VALERY GERGIEV CONDUCTING PROKOFIEV'S SEVENTH AND FINAL SYMPHONY 
WITH THE LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA GERGIEV SAYS OF THE WORK 
PROKOFIEV DOESN'T GO FOR BOMBAST AND DECIBEL BUT IT'S AN AUTUMNAL GESTURE OF THIS GREAT MUSICIAN 
EXPRESSING A LAST WISH OF SADNESS WITH THE PIECE'S HIGHLY ORIGINAL ENDING 
AS GERGIEV LEAVES THE STAGE THAT'S IT FROM THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL TONIGHT 
FOR NOW TIME TO BID YOU A VERY GOOD NIGHT FROM ALL OF US HERE AT THE PROMS
