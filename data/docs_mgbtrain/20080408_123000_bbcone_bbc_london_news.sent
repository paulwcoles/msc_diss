SCHOOL IN LEWISHAM WITH FEARS OF 
AN OUTBREAK AT ANOTHER HEALTH 
OFFICIALS SAY THE DISEASE IS 
SPREADING RAPIDLY AS THE UPTAKE OF 
THE M. M. R. JAB IN THE BOROUGH IS TOO 
LOW WE ARE JOINED BY MICHAEL CORR 
LEWISHAM'S IMMUNISATION CO 
ORDINATOR WHO IS AT LEWISHAM 
UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL WHERE THERE 
WAS AN OUTBREAK AL FEW WEEKS AGO 
LAST YEAR SEVERAL HUNDRED CASES IN 
HACKNEY HOW SERIOUS IS THIS 
OUTBREAK DO YOU THINK THIS THIS OUTBREAK MAY HAVE ORIGINATED IN 
NORTH EAST LONDON BUT IT WAS BOUND 
TO HAPPEN ACTUALLY WHEN YOU HAVE 
A SITUATION WHERE PARENTS DECIDE 
NOT TO IMMUNISE THEIR CHILDREN AND 
IT IS THEIR CHOICE SO TO DO 
EVENTUALLY YOU WILL GET AN NUMBER 
OF CHILDREN THAT ARE ABLE TO 
SUSTAIN AN OUTBREAK THAT IS WHAT 
WE HAVE GOT IN LEWISHAM 
WHY DO YOU 
THINK PEOPLE STILL ARMED IMMUNISING 
THEIR CHILDREN 
STILL ARE NOT 
IMMUNISING THEIR CHILDREN THERE 
ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS IN SOME 
CASES IT IS POSSIBLY DUE TO LACK 
OF AWARENESS ONE THING WE ARE 
DOING AT THIS MOMENT IS ALERTING 
ALL PARENTS AS TO WHERE THEY CAN 
GET THEIR CHILDREN UNDER FIVE 
IMMUNISED IN THE LOCAL PRESS OVER 
THE NEXT WEEK THERE IS COMING TO 
THE INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE CLINICS 
THERE IS GOING TO BE FOR 
CHILDREN UNDER FIVE AND ANYBODY 
OVER TWENTY FIVE THEY NEED TO SEE THEIR G. P. 
IS THERE STILL A FEAR OVER THE M. M. R. 
JAB IF SO ARE THERE ALTERNATIVES 
IS THERE AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE M. M. R. 
JAB 
YES IS THERE AN ALTERNATIVE JAB FOR PARENTS WHO ARE STILL 
CONCERNED 
THERE IS NOT REALLY ANY CONCERNED ALTERNATIVE AT ALL THERE HAVE BEEN 
A NUMBER OF PLACES WHERE PARENTS 
HAVE BEEN BUYING SINGLE VACCINES 
BUT WE CAN'T REALLY HAVE ANY 
CONFIDENCE IN THE SINGLE VACCINE 
BECAUSE IT IS NOT PART OF OUR 
ROUTINE PROCEDURE THE VACCINES ARE 
NOT MONITORED IN THE SAME WAY THE 
VACCINES IN THE ROUTINE SCHEDULE 
ARE

LEG FOR ARSENAL THEY'VE GIVEN AWAY 
A AWAY GOAL THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
GOING TO ANFIELD WITH A LEAD THEY 
MISSED A GATHERING OPEN GOAL WHEN

CHELSEA THOUGH THEY LOST TWO TO ONE IN 
ISTANBUL LAST WEEK BUT THEY GAVE 
AWAY TWO GOALS CHELSEA WILL WIN 
THAT GAME BUT THEY'RE UNDER NO 
ILLUSIONS OF THE TASK AHEAD OF THEM

BE AN EASY WIN FOR CHELSEA THEN
