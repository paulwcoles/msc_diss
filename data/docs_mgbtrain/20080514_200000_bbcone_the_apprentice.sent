GLORIA GLORIA 
IN EXCELSIS DEO 
IN EXCELSIS DEO 
GOOD MORNING 
GOOD MORNING SIR ALAN 
WELL HERE WE ARE IN THIS WONDERFUL CHURCH SAINT BARTHOLOMEW THE GREAT 
IT'S A CHURCH WHICH SOME OF YOU MAY RECOGNISE 
BECAUSE IT WAS USED IN THE FILM FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL 
NOW THE SUBJECT OF YOUR TASK THIS WEEK IS WEDDINGS 
WEDDINGS ARE VERY VERY BIG BUSINESS 
I'VE GOT YOU TWO STANDS AT THE NATIONAL WEDDING SHOW IN BIRMINGHAM 
YOU ARE GOING TO REPRESENT SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURERS OF ITEMS 
SUCH AS WEDDING DRESSES AT THIS EXHIBITION AND IT'S VERY VERY SIMPLE 
THE TEAM THAT SELLS THE MOST AMOUNT OF MERCHANDISE WILL WIN 
AND THE TEAM THAT DOESN'T WILL LOSE AND IN THAT TEAM ONE OF YOU WILL GET FIRED 
I'M GOING TO REORGANISE THE TEAMS A LITTLE BIT TO BALANCE THEM UP 
SO HELENE AND SARA WOULD YOU MOVE OVER HERE 
AND CLAIRE MOVE OVER THERE 
SO EVERYTHING CLEAR 
YES SIR ALAN OFF YOU GO 
THE NATIONAL WEDDING SHOW AT THE N. E. C. IN BIRMINGHAM ATTRACTS UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND VISITORS 
WITH THREE HUNDRED EXHIBITORS IT'S PACKED WITH BRIDES TO BE 
READY TO SPEND BIG MONEY ON THEIR BIG DAY 
TOMORROW THE TEAMS WILL BE HERE SELLING WEDDING DRESSES 
AND ROMANTIC ACCESSORIES THE TEAM THAT MAKES THE MOST MONEY WILL WIN 
I'M SO HAPPY ABOUT THIS TASK I LOVE DRESSES I'M A GIRL 
EVERY GIRL DREAMS OF WEDDING DRESSES 
SEE I'M THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE I'M KIND OF ANTI MARRIAGE 
AND IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING WE'VE GOT A CYNIC AND AN OPTIMIST 
TODAY THE TEAMS HAVE UNTIL FOUR P. M. TO VISIT WEDDING DRESS BUSINESSES SPREAD ACROSS LONDON 
AND SELECT ONE TO REPRESENT AT THE N. E. C. 
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT THAT THEY CHOOSE THE RIGHT PRODUCT 
I MEAN A WOMAN HOPEFULLY ONLY GETS MARRIED ONCE IN HER LIFE 
IT'S POSSIBLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PURCHASE OF A DRESS SHE'S EVER GOING TO MAKE SO IT HAS TO BE PERFECT 
ON TEAM RENAISSANCE HELENE STEPS FORWARD AS PROJECT MANAGER 
IN TERMS OF WEDDING EXPERIENCE I USED TO MODEL IN BRIDAL SHOWS SO I'VE GOT A BIT OF EXPERIENCE THERE 
AND BEING A GIRL OBVIOUSLY I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN A LOT OF MY FRIENDS' WEDDINGS 
PROJECT MANAGER FOR ALPHA LUCINDA 
SO IF WE'RE PLANNING OUR ROUTE 
IN ADDITION TO DRESSES THE TEAMS HAVE TO SELECT 
ONE OTHER WEDDING PRODUCT FROM A LIST OF BUSINESSES PROVIDED BY SIR ALAN 
DO YOU THINK IT MAKES SENSE WHEN WE SPLIT THE SUB TEAMS 
THAT ONE TEAM GOES TO DO THE WEDDING DRESS SHOPS AND ONE TEAM DOES THE OTHER SERVICES 
YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE ANY INFORMATION ACROSS THE WEDDING DRESSES IF WE'RE DOING IT 
I'D LIKE TO DO DO ALL OF THEM SO WE CAN MAKE A CLEAR DECISION 
CENTRAL LONDON'S NEAR NORTH LONDON SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE 
ONE FACTION OF THE TEAM GOING TO CENTRAL AND NORTH LONDON AND THE OTHER TEAM GOING TO SOUTH LONDON 
YES DEFINITELY I AGREE O. K. 
SO CAN WE SPLIT THESE OUT THEN O. K. 
KEEP IN TOUCH GUYS 
WILL DO SEE YOU LATER SEE YOU IN BIRMINGHAM GUYS 
THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT THINGS 
IN TERMS OF THE WAY WE NEED TO COME ACROSS IS PROFESSIONAL 
WHICH GOES WITHOUT SAYING BUT PASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT THEY DO 
WE HAVE TO BE VERY PROFESSIONAL VERY INTERESTED BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO REPRESENT THEM 
ON HELENE'S TEAM FIRST STOP FOR MICHAEL AND SARA TOP BRIDAL DESIGNER IAN STUART 
NICE TO MEET YOU HI I'M SARA 
HIS DRESSES SELL FOR UP TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
OH WOW WELL I CAN TELL YOU THAT LOOKS GREAT IT DOES LOOK GREAT 
IF BOTH TEAMS WANT THE SAME PRODUCT THE BUSINESS WILL CHOOSE WHICH TEAM TO GO WITH 
WHAT I ACTUALLY REALLY LOVE ABOUT THIS MORE THAN ANYTHING 
IT'S NOT JUST A SAMEY LINE OF DRESSES DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN EXACTLY 
THERE'S SUCH A RICH DIVERSITY AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL 
I FEIGNED INTEREST VERY WELL 
BRILLIANT BRILLIANT 
THAT'S WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING 
I CAN PRETEND I'M PASSIONATE AND PULL IT OFF WITH EFFORTLESS CHARM 
FANTASTIC THAT IS EXCITING 
WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR INSPIRATION OLD FILMS AND HISTORY BOOKS YES THERE'S A VERY THEATRICAL ELEMENT 
IT'S AN ACQUIRED TASTE BUT I DO THINK THAT BEING DIFFERENT IS THE WAY FORWARD 
SOME OF THEM WERE GHASTLY I WAS LIKE WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO WEAR SUCH A THING 
YEAH I THINK THE BIGGEST SELLING POINT IS HIS NAME 
ACROSS TOWN PROJECT MANAGER HELENE VISITS ANOTHER WEDDING DRESS BUSINESS THAT'S YOUR SOFT SCOOP 
THEY'RE SPECIALITY COLOURED DRESSES 
ALL UNDER NINE HUNDRED 
WEDDING DRESSES THEY START FROM THE RED GOING TO THE BLACK 
GOLD INTO THE PINK AND THEN WE'RE GOING INTO THE BLUES 
THE FIRST THING THAT JUMPS OUT AT ME IS 
FABULOUS BUT IT'S A VERY ACQUIRED TASTE 
IF YOU THINK OF ALL THE CELEBRITIES THAT HAVE JUST GOT MARRIED 
YES JODIE MARSH 
AND THEY ALL FOLLOW SUIT THE BRIDES WANT TO BE LIKE A CELEBRITY 
THE PRICE WAS A KEY THING IT WAS THE SORT OF DRESS YOU PICKED UP 
AND THOUGHT I BET IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE AND IT WASN'T 
SO THE PRICE KIND OF OFFSET MY OBJECTION TO THE COLOUR 
LET'S DO THIS 
ON LUCINDA'S TEAM ONLY CLAIRE AND RAEF ARE VISITING WEDDING DRESS BUSINESSES 
RAEF NICE TO MEET YOU HI RAEF DO YOU WANT TO COME THROUGH TO THE SHOWROOM YES PLEASE THANK YOU 
WOW 
STUNNING OH THAT'S GORGEOUS 
I WAS REALLY HAPPY WHEN LUCINDA ASKED ME TO GO LOOK AT DRESSES 
I THINK LUCINDA KNOWS WHAT I'M LIKE I LOVE FASHION 
I USED TO WORK IN A CLOTHES STORE I'M A GIRLY GIRL 
WHAT ABOUT THIS A BEAUTIFUL PINK DRESS YOU'RE HAVING A COUNTRY HOUSE WEDDING 
YOU'VE GOT A VERY LIGHT SILK ORGANZA SKIRT ALSO COMES IN IVORY AND OTHER COLOURS 
HOW DO PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT YOU IAN WE SHOW OUR COLLECTIONS BOTH HERE AND INTERNATIONALLY 
WHERE INTERNATIONALLY 
THE WHOLE OF THE WORLD O. K. 
MOST OF THE GIRLS AT THE WEDDING SHOW 
RE GOING TO KNOW OUR COLLECTION ANYWAY AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR OUR DRESSES 
JUST BEEN IN WEDDING DRESS ECSTASY IT WAS ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE 
HE HAS WON FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS BEST BRIDAL DESIGNER 
SO THIS GUY IS LIKE THE HEAD HONCHO OF WEDDING DRESSES EXCELLENT 
PROJECT MANAGER LUCINDA IS HUNTING FOR ANOTHER WEDDING PRODUCT TO SELL ALONGSIDE THE TEAM'S DRESSES 
SHE'S AT AN EXCLUSIVE CAKE SHOP IN PUTNEY SOUTH LONDON 
MOST OF OUR DESIGNS ARE SIMPLE THEY HAVE CLEAN LINES 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO US IS THE LOOK AND TASTE OF THE CAKE 
IT'S GORGEOUS 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY LOVELY 
THE CAKES ARE APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED A POP 
IS THAT EXPENSIVE I DON'T KNOW 
ONE P. M. THREE HOURS BEFORE THE TEAMS MUST DECIDE WHAT TO SELL 
HELLO HI NICE MEETING YOU I'M CLAIRE 
ON LUCINDA'S TEAM RAEF AND CLAIRE ARE IN SOUTH LONDON TO SEE DRESSES FOR BIGGER BRIDES SIZE SIXTEEN 
OH RAEF MAYBE I SHOULD GET A BOYFRIEND 
IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL IT IS VERY NICE 
I WONDER HOW MANY OF THE SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE 
COMING INTO BIRMINGHAM TOMORROW ARE GOING TO BE BETWEEN A SIZE SIXTEEN AND A THIRTY TWO YES 
IS IT A BAD PARTNERSHIP IF WE HAD CAKE AND 
SIZE SIXTEEN DRESS 
I THINK WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT THOSE PEOPLE IN A SIZE SIXTEEN TO THIRTY TWO DRESS 
ARE SIZE SIXTEEN AND THIRTY TWO FOR A REASON THEY LOVE CAKE 
CAKES ARE NEXT ON THE LIST FOR MICHAEL AND SARA 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR ME SECOND TO THE WEDDING DRESS IS CAKES 
I'VE BEEN ON A CAKE COURSE AS WELL FANTASTIC SO I UNDERSTAND A LITTLE ABOUT CAKES 
I THINK CAKES IS A BIG PART OF THE WHOLE WEDDING THEME 
AND IT'S MOSTLY GOING TO BE WOMEN AND YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE CAKES 
ONE HOUR TO GO BEFORE FINAL CHOICES MUST BE MADE 
THIS IS THE WOW FACTOR YOU'VE ABSOLUTELY GOT TO HAVE THIS 
THIS IS THE EASIEST SELLER YOU'LL FIND 
PERSONALISED WEDDING LINGERIE AND HONEYMOON BEACHWEAR ARE NEXT ON THE LIST FOR ALEX AND HELENE 
I THINK IT'S LOVELY AND CLASSY 
AND LOOKING AT THIS STUFF I THINK IT'S REALLY PRETTY 
I THINK THIS IS AWESOME I BET YOU DO 
I'M QUITE HUNG UP ON THIS THIS IS BRILLIANT 
I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT IT MYSELF AND I DEFINITELY WANT TO REPRESENT YOU ON THE DAY 
SO IF THE OTHER TEAM CHOOSES YOURSELF AS WELL 
I OBVIOUSLY WANT TO BE FIRST CHOICE SO LOVELY TO MEET YOU SHARON 
O. K. GOOD LUCK WITH IT THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME 
SMALLER ITEMS YOU KNOW TWENTY TO THIRTY 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE A LOT EASIER TO SELL AND GET AN ORDER 
SO I THINK THAT'S HOW WE'LL WIN THIS 
HI THERE IT'S MICHAEL 
HOW'S IT GOING OUR MEETING WITH THE CAKE PROVIDER 
WENT ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANTLY WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR LET'S SAY A FIVE TIER CAKE 
FIVE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
A LOT OF THESE WEDDING SHOWS ARE ABOUT PEOPLE GOING TO BROWSE 
COULD YOU GET SOMEONE TO BUY THEIR WEDDING CAKE AT THE N. E. C. 
I DON'T THINK SO I THINK YOU'D REALLY STRUGGLE 
AN INTELLIGENT PERSON WOULD HAVE SENT TWO PEOPLE TO GO AND LOOK AT WEDDING DRESSES AND TWO PEOPLE TO 
LOOK AT THE OTHER STOCK SO THEN THEY COULD MAKE AN ACTUAL OVERALL OPINION OF WHICH ONES WE SHOULD GO FOR 
YOU SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THAT TO HELENE 
THIS IS A FANTASTIC DISPLAY EVERYTHING'S THERE AND GRASPABLE 
LUCINDA ALSO HAS HER EYE ON THE UNDERWEAR AS HER TEAM'S OTHER PRODUCT 
YOUR PRODUCTS ARE RETAILING FROM FIFTEEN SO IT'S NOT A BIG HOLE IN THE POCKET 
THE DRESS IS A BIG THING OF HER LIFE 
WHEREAS THIS IS JUST LIKE OH WOW THAT'S FOR ME 
BRILLIANT THAT WAS FANTASTIC YEAH I AM I HAVE TO SAY SURPRISED 
ME TOO WE THINK THAT ONE RATHER THAN THE CAKES I RECKON WE'RE ON 
COME ON CLAIRE 
FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE THE TEAMS MUST CHOOSE 
HI RAEF PLEASED TO MEET YOU 
FOR CLAIRE AND RAEF FINAL APPOINTMENT OF THE DAY A BIG HIGH STREET RETAILER 
THE RANGE I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY IS A COLLECTION OF MIX AND MATCH SEPARATES FOR BRIDAL WEAR 
THE BENEFIT YOU HAVE WITH OUR RANGE IS IT'S INCREDIBLY BROAD APPEAL BECAUSE IT'S VERY CLASSIC 
SOMETIMES THEY DON'T WANT THE BIG ELABORATE DRESS YES 
TOTAL OUTFIT'S NINETY FIVE REALLY 
I THINK THE WHOLE RANGE LOOKS LOVELY FOR ME THAT IS DEFINITELY MY FIRST CHOICE 
I HAVE TO SAY 
MY FIRST CHOICE IS IAN STUART 
WE NEED TO MAKE A DECISION QUICKLY 
I'M GOING TO START WITH IAN STUART 
FIRSTLY IT'S HIGHER VALUE SO IT'S HIGHER END SO IT'S BIGGER PROFIT O. K. 
WHAT WERE THE DRESSES LIKE MICHAEL JUST SO I CAN TRY AND VISUALISE 
IMAGINE THE DRESSES THAT THE WOMEN WERE WEARING IN BEAUTY AND THE BEAST OR LIKE LES MISERABLES 
THEY'RE VERY MIXED AS WELL THEY'RE INTERNATIONAL 
THEY ARE VERY VERY UNIQUE O. K. BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PER DRESS O. K. 
HOWEVER HE'S VERY RENOWNED AS A DESIGNER AND THEY'LL BE A LOT OF 
HIS DRESSES WHEN THEY COME TO THE EXHIBITION 
FOR ME IT'S THE WAY TO GO BUT OBVIOUSLY I HAVEN'T SEEN THE OTHER TWO 
THEY'RE VERY EXPENSIVE DRESSES YOURS 
AND IF I WAS GOING TO SPEND THAT MUCH MONEY ON A DRESS 
I WOULD WANT THE EXPERT THERE SELLING THE DRESS 
OURS IS HALF THE PRICE SOME OF THEM ARE ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL 
AND THE COLOURED DRESSES WILL BRING PEOPLE OVER RIGHT O. K. HELENE 
HELENE CONVINCED MICHAEL AND I THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO GO FOR MIDDLE RANGE DRESSES 
I HAD NOT SEEN THE DRESSES THAT HELENE WENT TO SEE SO I COULDN'T 
MAKE A JUDGEMENT ON THEM I HAD TO GO WITH WHAT SHE SAID 
HI LUCINDA IT'S CLAIRE 
GIVE US YOUR POINTS WHAT DO YOU THINK RAEF PREFERS IAN STUART AND I PREFER B. H. S. 
WHAT IT'S COMING DOWN TO IS DO WE REALLY THINK 
SOMEBODY WALKING THROUGH THE DOORS OF THE N. E. C. TOMORROW WILL PAY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FOR A DRESS 
HOW DOES RAEF FEEL ABOUT THAT IAN STUART DRESSES ARE EXPENSIVE BUT SOMEBODY GOES TO THAT 
N. E. C. KNOWING THEY CAN GET AN IAN STUART DRESS THEY'LL GO FOR IT 
OH IT'S ALMOST THE HIGHER THE RISK THE HIGHER THE GAIN 
CLAIRE YOU'RE WITH B. H. S. 
LET'S GO FOR IAN STUART FIRST OPTION AND B. H. S. SECOND OPTION 
RIGHT O. K. WE'LL DO THAT 
SO YOU CHANGED THAT YEAH WE KNOW THAT HE'S IN BRIDAL MAGAZINES 
HE'S A FANTASTIC GUY HIS DRESSES ARE STUNNING AND VISUALLY I THINK 
THEY'LL HAVE A GREAT IMPACT ON THE STAND 
SO I'M QUITE HAPPY 
AFTER SELECTING DIFFERENT DRESSES THE TEAMS HEAD FOR BIRMINGHAM 
LUCINDA'S TEAM WILL SELL THE HIGH END DESIGNER GOWNS 
WHILE HELENE HAS OPTED FOR THE MID RANGE COLOURED DRESSES 
HI SHARON IT'S HELENE FROM RENAISSANCE HELLO HELENE 
THEY'VE GOT TO CONVINCE THE BUSINESS OWNER TO GO WITH THEIR TEAM 
ONE THING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME TO MENTION IS WE'VE SELECTED 
OUR DRESSES AND THEY ABSOLUTELY ONE HUNDRED PER CENT COMPLEMENT YOUR PRODUCT LINE 
O. K. AND WHO'S DRESSES ARE THEY 
WHAT SORRY THE DRESSES ARE 
THEY'RE CALLED THE WHITE ROSE COLLECTION UH HUH

THE FIRST CHANCE TO GET A CLOSER LOOK AT THEIR PRODUCTS 
LOOK AT THAT I THINK THAT'S BEAUTIFUL OOH YES

EVEN TEN SALES OF THESE EACH WE'RE LOOKING AT A FORTUNE 
THAT'S FIFTY TIMES TEN IT'S A LOT OF MONEY 
FUCKING HELL UNBELIEVABLE 
LOOK AT THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING 
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE DREAMS COME TRUE 
WHEN I SAW THE PRODUCTS I WAS ECSTATIC THEY ARE STUNNING 
I DO BELIEVE THAT IT IS WHAT A BRIDE WOULD BE LOOKING FOR IN THEIR DRESS 
IT'S MASSIVE 
DO PEOPLE WHO COME TO THIS WEDDING SHOW ACTUALLY PAY 
TWO THOUSAND FOR A WEDDING DRESS THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES' 
WHAT'S GOING ON ROUND THE BACK 
IT'S OPEN OH IT'S NOT BAD NO WOW COME ON IN 
OH GOSH THESE ARE REALLY SHORT 
AND THESE ARE FOR WEDDINGS BELIEVE IT OR NOT THAT'S A WEDDING DRESS 
SOME OF THESE ARE A LITTLE BIT TACKY IN MY OPINION 
IN TERMS OF I WOULDN'T BUY THEM BUT I CAN SEE HOW OTHER PEOPLE WOULD 
THE DRESSES ME AND MICHAEL WENT TO SEE WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER TO SELL 
BECAUSE THEY WERE MORE WEDDINGY THEY WERE MORE GLAMOROUS 
I THINK WE'VE GOT A VERY DIFFICULT TASK AHEAD OF US TOMORROW 
THE DAY OF THE SHOW 
WE ARE GOING TO WIN TODAY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR ME 
THE TEAMS WILL HAVE EIGHT HOURS TO SELL THEIR WEDDING PRODUCTS 
OH THAT LOOKS GORGEOUS

IN TERMS OF THE TASK AT HAND IT'S ALL ABOUT A SOFT SELL 
IT'S THE MOST MAGICAL DAY OF A GIRL'S LIFE NINETY PER CENT OF PURCHASES ARE BY WOMEN

THIS IS TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN 
ON HELENE'S STAND ALEX IS IN CHARGE OF SELLING THE TEAM'S MID RANGE COLOURED DRESSES

WE JUST TAKE A DEPOSIT TODAY FOR FIFTY PER CENT OF THE TOTAL PRICE 
YES ONE HUNDRED PER CENT HAPPY WITH THAT YES IT'S GORGEOUS

WHICH DRESS WAS IT ON IT WAS THE REALLY SHORT ONE REALLY YES 
THIS TYPE YES THAT TYPE ONE 
THE SHOW IS IN FULL SWING 
AH HELLO LADIES 
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS STUFF BEFORE 
FOR LEE ON LUCINDA'S STAND 
THE LOW COST LINGERIE AND HONEYMOON BEACHWEAR ARE PROVING AN EASY SELL THAT'S FANTASTIC THAT'S FOURTEEN POINT NINE NINE 
THAT'S NOT TOO BAD IS IT 
I'M NOT SURE WE'RE MAKING ENOUGH MONEY JUST THROUGH PURELY THE WEDDING ACCESSORIES 
I'VE DONE ABOUT EIGHT SALES BUT WE NEED TO BACK IT UP WITH WEDDING DRESS SALES 
THAT WOULD LOOK FABULOUS ON PHOTOS WOULDN'T IT 
THERE'S LOTS OF INTEREST BUT NO SALES FOR LUCINDA'S COSTLY DRESSES 
I THINK THIS COLOUR'S PERFECT ON YOU 
HAVE YOU BEEN ON HOLIDAY 
LADIES HI IAN STUART DRESS 
FOR ME GOING FOR THE HIGH PRICED WEDDING DRESS 
WAS MOST CERTAINLY THE HIGH RISK STRATEGY BUT WITH HIGH RISKS 
I'VE LEARNT IN LIFE AND IN BUSINESS COME HIGH GAINS 
SO ON MY HEAD BE IT 
IT'S NOT WHAT I WAS THINKING OF BUT I LIKE IT 
MOST PEOPLE COME IN HERE AND SEE THE DRESSES AND THINK THEY LOOK QUITE UNUSUAL 
THEY TRY THEM ON AND THEY FEEL A MILLION DOLLARS AND THEY BUY THEM 
I DO REALLY LIKE IT 
BUT IT'S THE FIRST DRESS I'VE TRIED ON 
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL 
BUT IT'S A LOT OF MONEY 
AND IT'S THE SORT OF DECISION THAT I'D NORMALLY GO AWAY AND THINK ABOUT 
HI IAN STUART DRESS 
RAEF WAS INSISTENT ON THIS HIGH END EXPENSIVE BRAND OF WEDDING DRESSES 
WITHOUT ACTUALLY TAKING ANY NOTICE OF REALLY WHAT THE MASS MARKET WOULD BUY 
THIS IS A MASS MARKET PLACE 
WE'RE NOT IN KNIGHTSBRIDGE WE'RE IN BIRMINGHAM 
MIDDAY 
HELENE'S TEAM IS SHIFTING ITS MID PRICE DRESSES 
THE SASH HERE GOES SIDE TO SIDE BUT IT WRAPS AROUND SO IT'S SLIMMING 
IT'S THE COLOUR AGAINST YOUR SKIN TONE 
AND THE THING IS YOU'RE GOOD HE'S GOOD 
WHAT CAN I SAY 
THAT'S GOOD WE'VE SOLD ANOTHER ONE I'M A HAPPY CHAPPY 
IT'S THE MOST EXPENSIVE DRESS WHICH IS GOOD 
IF YOU WANTED TO BUY THIS CAKE FOR FIVE TIERS IT'S FIVE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
IT'S ALL EDIBLE FANTASTIC 
SARA AND MICHAEL ARE PUSHING THEIR TOP PRICE CAKES 
WE'LL GET OUR CONSULTANT TO MAKE THE FIRST POINT OF CALL WITH YOU 
AND OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS HE'LL BE LIAISING WITH YOU ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT 
THE FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS THE CAKE EVERYTHING WE BUILD IN ANOTHER TIER 
AND YOU CAN HAVE DIFFERENT FLAVOURS FOR DIFFERENT TIERS 
MICHAEL IS TELESALES WHICH 
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT THERE IN PERSON YOU HAVE TO SELL HARD 
YOU HAVE TO KEEP THEM ON THE PHONE YOU HAVE TO TALK OVER THEM 
HE'S TRANSFERRED THAT IN THIS PROCESS OVER TO DIRECT FACE TO FACE SALES IT DOESN'T WASH 
THERE'S A LIMITED AMOUNT THEY'RE ONLY AVAILABLE TODAY THAT IS IT 
IF YOU DON'T PUSH YOURSELF 
YOU LOOK AROUND AND YOU DON'T FIND THE SAME CAKE ANYWHERE ELSE 
CAN I JUST GO AWAY AND HAVE A THINK ABOUT IT AND PHONE THE GROOM 
YOU CAN I MEAN YOU COULD CALL THE GROOM I'M HERE TILL FIVE THIRTY 
SARA CAN'T READ OTHER PEOPLE VERY WELL 
AND YOU COULD SEE PEOPLE ALMOST LIKE YOU KNOW GOD 
IT'S VERY NICE BUT I NEED TO SPEAK TO THE GROOM AS WELL I WOULDN'T JUST BE ABLE TO ORDER IT 
IS IT SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN PAY THE DEPOSIT 
THIS IS A COMPANY I'D LIKE TO ORDER FROM BECAUSE I LIKE THE TASTE 
SHE WAS QUITE PUSHY TRYING TO GET A DEPOSIT OUT OF US' 
IT DID PUT ME OFF A LITTLE BIT I DON'T LIKE BEING FORCED INTO THINGS IT MAKES ME BACK OFF 
TWO THIRTY LEE HAS SHIFTED OVER THREE HUNDRED WORTH OF THE SPARKLY UNDERWEAR 
WOULD YOU BE MORE INTERESTED IN A THONG YEAH AS I SAID THE THONG STARTS AT FOURTEEN POINT NINE NINE 
FINE O. K. COOL I'VE GOT TO ASK YOU WHAT SIZE YOU ARE NOW ON THONGS 
I'M SELLING PANTIES SO WHAT I'M DOING IS I'M GUESSING THEIR SIZE 
AND I'M GUESSING LOWER THAN WHAT I ACTUALLY THINK 
SO WHAT SIZE ARE YOU EIGHT 
I'LL HAVE A TWELVE PLEASE 
I'M BUZZING I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT IT SO LET'S GO AND SELL SOME MORE KNICKERS 
ANOTHER BRIDE TO BE ANOTHER SALE FROM HELENE'S STAND 
SO YOU HAPPY WITH THAT YEAH IT'S GREAT 
THE DRESSES HAVE BEEN A GREAT CHOICE 
THEY CAN BE USED AS BRIDESMAIDS' DRESSES EVENING DRESSES GOING OUT DRESSES 
THAT'S HIT THE SPOT WITH PEOPLE 
THE PRICES HAVE BEEN A BIG WINNER AS WELL THEY'RE EXTREMELY WELL PRICED 
THEY'RE BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED FOR WHAT YOU GET FOR YOUR MONEY 
THREE DRESSES SOLD 
BUT THE TEAM HAS YET TO SELL A WEDDING CAKE 
WE'RE ONLY GIVING IT TO A FEW BRIDES FOR THEIR WEDDING DAY SO IF YOU ARE INTERESTED I'D NEED TO KNOW TODAY 
SO HOW DOES IT SOUND WE'LL JUST HAVE A WALK AROUND AND HAVE A THINK 
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO MAKE DECISIONS ON CAKES 
WITHOUT THEIR HUSBANDS OR THEIR BOYFRIEND OR WHATEVER AND IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO GET A DECISION 
IT'S HARDER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE 
IF YOU CAN'T MAKE YOUR MIND UP 
WE'LL NEVER GET STARTED 
I THINK THIS IS DEFINITELY THE DRESS MUM 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THAT MELT IN THE MOUTH DELICIOUS 
SOONER OR LATER I'LL GET A DEAL OF COURSE 
AH MATE WE NEED SOME MORE FOOTFALL 
IF YOU DO IT TODAY I'LL GIVE YOU A KISS

TIME IS RUNNING OUT 
THE DESIGNER DRESSES ARE NOT SELLING 
IT'S AN IAN STUART PRICE ISN'T IT WELL 
BY AROUND FOUR O'CLOCK I WAS SERIOUSLY QUESTIONING 
MY JUDGEMENT OF THE PRICE RANGE I THINK 
BY THEN I THINK WE WERE ALL THINKING OUR PRICES WERE TOO HIGH 
SORRY BE ONE MINUTE 
LUCINDA SWITCHES LEE TO SELLING DRESSES 
YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY A MILLION DOLLARS 
OBVIOUSLY I'D THAT WITH A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN STANDING THERE 
DESPERATE MEASURES ARE CALLED FOR 
RAEF SLIPS INTO SOMETHING FLUFFY 
IT MAY COME ACROSS AS A BIT CHILDISH AND SILLY 
BUT IT DOES HAVE A SERIOUS PURPOSE WHICH IS TO GENERATE SALES 
AND HERE I GO 
IN THE LINGERIE COMPANY'S PROMOTIONAL OUTFIT 
HE HOPES TO ATTRACT ATTENTION TO THE TEAM'S TOP END DRESSES 
I HONESTLY NEED HELP BECAUSE I CAN'T 
I'M GOING TO SUFFOCATE IN THIS DAMN THING 
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL 
HAVE A DISCUSSION LET ME GO AWAY A BIT COS THERE'S A BIT OF PRESSURE 
BUT FOR THE DESIGNER DRESSES STILL NO SALES 
IT'S REALLY BUSY AND IT'S QUALITY 
BUT I'VE GOT THAT WOMAN TO BUY THAT WEDDING DRESS LIKE THAT TWO GRAND 
AND I NEED TO NAIL HER IF WE DON'T GET THIS WE'LL LOSE THE TASK 
AND I'M WORRIED THAT THIS HIGH END STUFF AIN'T SHIFTING I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE'VE GOT THE RIGHT DRESSES 
LESS THAN TWO HOURS TO GO 
MICHAEL IS STILL AFTER A FIRST SALE ON THE SIX HUNDRED WEDDING CAKES 
I DON'T WANT TO PUSH YOU INTO IT 
BUT I'M WORRIED THAT YOU'LL REGRET IT IF YOU DON'T DO IT 
CAN I GO AWAY AND MAKE A PHONE CALL AND SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT THE IDEA 
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE HIM A CALL NOW I'LL STEP AWAY 
LISTEN THERE'S A GENTLEMAN HERE THAT'S GOT THIS CAKE 
WELL THIS IS LIKE LITTLE CUP CAKES ON LIKE A PERSPEX STAND 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT RIGHT O. K. 
O. K. BYE 
HE WANTS A TRADITIONAL CAKE 
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND TWO HUNDRED MORE FOR A TRADITIONAL CAKE AND IT WILL LOOK DULL 
IT'S JUST A. IT'S A REAL SHAME 
THIS IS YOUR BLOODY WEDDING I MEAN GOD ABOVE 
GO ON 
I DON'T FEEL I CAN GO AHEAD WITH IT 
NO MATTER WHAT SORT OF CONNOTATIONS YOU COME UP WITH YEAH 
I WAS TRYING TO SAY YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET DOING IT 
YOU WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE IN LIFE 
I NEED TO GO AWAY AND THINK ABOUT IT

YOU CAN GO THROUGH TO THE BOARDROOM NOW 
GOOD AFTERNOON 
GOOD AFTERNOON SIR ALAN 
NOW HELENE YOU WERE THE TEAM LEADER OF RENAISSANCE IS THAT RIGHT 
YES SIR ALAN YES AND LUCINDA TEAM LEADER OF ALPHA 
YES GOOD TEAM LEADER LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
VERY GOOD VERY GOOD WORKED WELL REALLY ENJOYED WORKING TOGETHER 
RIGHT THERE'S SOME POSITIVE STUFF COMING OUT HERE LUCINDA ISN'T THERE 
CONSIDERING SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE A FEW WEEKS AGO ABOUT YOUR GOOD SELF GOOD 
WE SPLIT INTO TWO GROUPS CLAIRE AND RAEF WENT ONTO THE DRESS GROUP LEE AND I WENT TO SEE ACCESSORIES 
HOW DID YOU COME TO THE DECISION ON WHAT DRESS YOU'D TAKE 
WELL OBVIOUSLY CLAIRE AND I FIRST WENT OFF TO THE HIGH END RETAILER 
WE KNEW HE HAD A REPUTATION WE KNEW HE'D WON FOUR AWARDS IN A ROW 
SO I WAS HAPPY JUST TO GO STRAIGHT IN 
BIG RISK IT IS YES A BIG RISK TO GO FOR THE HIGHEST 
IT'S A BIG RISK SIR ALAN BUT 
YOU TAKING THAT RESPONSIBILITY THEN OFF LUCINDA'S SHOULDERS 
NO NO I MEAN LOOK IF IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT WE HAVEN'T SOLD ENOUGH 
TO WIN THIS I'M FULLY AWARE THAT I WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR MOST OF THAT BUT WE DID CONSENSUALLY AGREE 
WHO WAS SELLING THE WEDDING DRESSES JUST CLAIRE THAT WAS ME 
LUCINDA I HELPED AS WELL WHAT WAS YOU DOING LEE 
I WAS DURING THE MORNING AND EARLY PART OF THE AFTERNOON SELLING THE WEDDING ACCESSORIES 
THE SPARKLING KNICKERS SPARKLING KNICKERS BIKINIS FLIP FLOPS 
DO YOU FEEL YOU'RE NOW THE FOREMOST EXPERT ON THAT 
ON HOW TO SELL A LADY A THONG YES ER YES 
HELENE ON THE DRESSES DID YOUR PEOPLE GO AND SEE ALL FOUR WEDDING DRESS VENDORS 
YES WE DID SIR ALAN MYSELF AND HELENE SAW TWO 
AND MICHAEL AND SARA SAW TWO OF THE WEDDING DRESS SUPPLIERS 
NO ONE PERSON SAW ALL FOUR NO ONE PERSON SAW ALL FOUR SIR ALAN 
RIGHT THE FUNDAMENTAL ERROR FOR ME AN AWFUL ERROR 
WAS NOT HAVING TWO PEOPLE SEEING ALL THE DRESSES 
BECAUSE I COULDN'T THEN MAKE A DECISION ON WHETHER THE MID RANGE COLOUR DRESSES 
WERE BETTER THAN THE HIGH END ONES BUT I WAS VERY KEEN TO GO FOR THE HIGH END DRESS RETAILER 
I HAVE NO REGRET ABOUT THE DRESS CHOICE WHATSOEVER I THINK IT WAS A REALLY GOOD CHOICE FOR THE DAY 
O. K. WELL LET'S SEE HOW WE GOT ON SHALL WE 
NICK ON ALPHA 
ALPHA CAME HOME WITH A TOTAL 
OF FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY TWO POINT NINE NINE 
AND HOW DID THAT BREAK DOWN 
THAT BROKE DOWN AS LEE'S STERLING WORK WITH THE SPANGLY KNICKERS 
BROUGHT HOME SIX HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN POINT TWO FOUR 
AND CLAIRE BROUGHT HOME FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIVE 
HOW MANY DRESSES WITH THREE DESIGNER DRESSES 
MARGARET LET'S HEAR THE NUMBERS FOR HELENE'S TEAM 
WELL THEY SOLD FIVE DRESSES 
BUT NO CAKES 
AND THEY RAISED A TOTAL OF ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE 
RIGHT 
WELL YOU ROLLED THE DICE THERE YOU LOT AND YOU WON SO WELL DONE WELL DONE ON YOUR GAMBLE 
ALSO ALAN SOME GREAT SALESMANSHIP FROM CLAIRE SHE WORKED LIKE A TROUPER 
REALLY YES GOOD ABSOLUTELY AND WELL LED BY LUCINDA 
THANK YOU NICK GOOD GOOD 
O. K. WELL I'VE ARRANGED FOR YOU A PRIVATE ROOM IN A FASHIONABLE SPA 
IN THE CITY OF LONDON A SPA WHERE COMPANIES SEND ALL THEIR HIGH FLYING EXECUTIVES 
TO RELAX AND ENJOY YOURSELF SO WELL DONE ON THIS TASK 
HELENE AND RENAISSANCE 
ONE OF YOU WILL BE GETTING FIRED 
OFF YOU GO AND I'LL SEE YOU LATER THANKS SIR ALAN 
I HAVE TO SAY YOU'VE ALL DONE INCREDIBLY WELL 
THANK YOU CHEERS HERE'S TO TEAM ALPHA 
CHEERS ABSOLUTELY CHEERS ALPHA 
I DON'T LIKE THAT IT TASTES LIKE LEAVES A BIT ANISEEDY 
M. M. M. NO MAYBE I'M TOO NORTHERN AND LIKE P. G. TIPS 
THIS TREATMENT IS COMPLETELY BASED ON PRINCIPLES OF ENERGY 
TAI SHA O. O. OH 
O. O. OH 
WE ALL TRIED OUR ABSOLUTE BEST TO SELL EVERY ITEM 
TO BE HONEST I THINK IT'S ABOUT TAKING GAMBLES AND TAKING CHANCES 
AND I THINK WE PLAYED IT SAFE AND THAT'S WHY WE LOST 
I DON'T THINK WE DID TOO BAD SELLING FIVE DRESSES 
WE DID BRILLIANT BUT PRODUCT CHOICE YOU KNOW THE CAKE WAS A HARD SELL 
NOT A TEN CAKE IS IT IT'S FIVE HUNDRED 
MYSELF MICHAEL AND ALEX 
PUT ALL THAT WE HAD ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WE HAD INTO SELLING 
AND THE PERSON WHO LEAST CONTRIBUTED WAS HELENE HERSELF 
IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'VE LOST HOW SUDDENLY PEOPLE START TO TURN AND THEIR OPINIONS CHANGE 
AND IT'S ALL ABOUT COVERING YOUR ARSE 
THE ONLY PERSON TO BLAME FOR THE FAILING OF THIS TASK IS HELENE 
I'LL BE INTERESTED TO SEE HOW SHE'S GOING TO SPIN HER WAY OUT OF THIS 
YES SIR ALAN 
SIR ALAN'S READY FOR YOU NOW 
MICHAEL I GOT THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION 
EVEN BEFORE I'D ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS 
THAT YOU WERE ALREADY KIND OF COVERING YOUR TRACKS ON THIS 
THAT'S NOT CORRECT SIR ALAN 
WELL WHY DIDN'T YOU PUSH FOR THE DESIGNER DRESSES 
I DID PUSH FOR THE DESIGNER DRESSES THAT WAS 
YOU DIDN'T PUSH FOR THE DESIGNER DRESSES I FELT THAT 
THE HIGH END DRESSES WERE THE WAY TO GO FORWARD HOWEVER 
CAN I QUOTE WHAT YOU ACTUALLY SAID 
YEP NOT TO EVERYONE'S TASTE QUITE NICHE QUITE EXPENSIVE 
IT DON'T SOUND LIKE A RECOMMENDATION TO ME 
EITHER YOU DIDN'T RECOGNISE AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE THAT THIS WAS THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN 
AS FAR AS THE FOUR DRESSES THAT YOU WERE BEING OFFERED 
OR THAT YOU JUST WANTED TO LET SOMEONE ELSE MAKE THE DECISION 
OUR ARGUMENT WAS YOU WERE THE ONES THAT WENT AND SAW IT YOU SEE WHICH IS A FLAW BY THE WAY 
BECAUSE TWO OF YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE WHOLE FOUR 
THEN YOU COULD HAVE COME UP WITH A QUALIFIED DECISION 
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS IF SOMEONE HAD HAVE COME ON THE PHONE AND PASSIONATELY SAID 
ABSOLUTELY WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS AT NO POINT WAS THAT EVER UP FOR DEBATE 
BUT AS A TEAM LEADER YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAYING 
I AGREE SIR ALAN I WANT ALL THE FOUR DRESSES SEEN BY SOMEBODY AT LEAST AND YOU DIDN'T RIGHT 
I AGREE SIR ALAN A BIG FLAW 
ALEX AS A SIX TIME VETERAN I BELIEVE ON LOSING TEAMS 
ARE YOU JUST AN UNLUCKY PERSON OR WHAT 
HE DID REALLY WELL SIR ALAN ON THIS THE LAST TWO DAYS 
EVERYBODY SAYS HE DOES REALLY WELL I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GOT THIS THING ABOUT MESMERISING HIS TEAM LEADERS 
HE'S ALWAYS ON THE LOSING SIDE WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS ON THE LOSING SIDE 
I DON'T KNOW SIR ALAN I DON'T BELIEVE I COULD HAVE DONE ANY MORE 
I STOOD FOR SIX HOURS AND OUT OF THE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THAT WE SOLD ON THE DAY 
I SOLD ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FIVE OF IT WHICH IS WELL OVER THREE QUARTERS OF THE REVENUE 
SO IF IT'S NOT YOU THAT IS GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE IN THIS TASK WHO IS 
IT WAS A SALES TASK SO THE ONLY THING I CAN TAKE FROM THAT IS THE PERSON WHO SOLD THE LEAST STUFF 
ON THE DAY I MEAN THAT WOULD BE THE FAIREST WAY 
THAT WOULD BE ME BUT I MEAN THEN AGAIN I'VE GOT TO SAY 
AS A TEAM EFFORT I CAN'T BE THERE SELLING THE DRESS BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU'LL LOOK AFTER THE DRESSES 
AS I WAS BRINGING PEOPLE IN SO TO SAY THE PERSON WHO DIDN'T CLOSE THE DEAL 
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE OF THE TASK I FIND HIGHLY UNFAIR 
HELENE CAKES WHY DID YOU END UP WITH THE CAKES THEN 
BECAUSE WE LOST OUT TO THE OTHER TEAM RIGHT 
I PICKED THE ACCESSORIES STRAIGHT AWAY AS I SOON AS I SAW IT I THOUGHT 
THAT IS GOING TO SELL AND I WENT IN WITH AN LOT OF PASSION AND SHE SEEMED TO REALLY GEL WITH US 
DID SHE ASK YOU WHAT ELSE YOU HAD ON YOUR STAND WHAT ELSE YOU WERE GOING TO DISPLAY 
I TOLD HER THAT WOULD BE THE DRESSES PICKING THE WRONG DRESSES 
IN MY OPINION HAS HAD A DOUBLE BARRELLED EFFECT HERE 
BECAUSE IF YOU'D HAVE COME UP TO THIS WOMAN AND SAID TO HER AH BY THE WAY WE'VE GOT 
ONE OF THE LEADING DRESS DESIGNERS SO THEREFORE YOUR STUFF IS GOING TO BE COMPLEMENTED BY THAT 
YOU MAY HAVE CONVINCED HER AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT PULLED OFF THE DEAL FOR LUCINDA 
I ALSO HEARD THAT SARA AND MICHAEL ACTUALLY BACKED CAKES YOU WANTED TO DO CAKES THAT'S CORRECT SIR ALAN 
YOU SAW FROM YOUR RESULTS YOU DIDN'T SELL ANY WHY NOT 
I THINK MAINLY BECAUSE WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS A DECISION 
THAT COULDN'T JUST BE MADE BY THE BRIDE ALONE 
IT HAD TO BE MADE WITH THE BRIDE THE GROOM AND THE FAMILY AS WELL 
SO A MISTAKE TO CHOOSE IT IT WAS A MISTAKE TO CHOOSE IT SO 
WE TRIED OUR ABSOLUTE BEST BUT IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
WE PITCHED A HARD SELL THAT'S NOT A GOOD ENOUGH EXCUSE 
A BIT TOO HARD PERHAPS A BIT TOO HARD YEAH 
ON CAKES THERE WAS QUITE A LOT OF FEEDBACK THAT PEOPLE FELT THEY WERE BEING BLUDGEONED 
BY MICHAEL AND SARA THERE WAS SOMETHING RELENTLESS ABOUT THE M. BOT H. 
I MEAN YOU'D HAVE BEEN SCARED TO BUY A CAKE 
I MEAN SARA YOU HAVE GOT A TENDENCY OF TRANSMITTING BUT NOT RECEIVING 
YOU'VE GOT A TENDENCY OF TALK TALK TALK TALK TALK 
AND NOT LISTENING TO WHAT THE PERSON'S SAYING 
AND THERE ARE SOME TIMES WHERE YOU HAVE TO BE VERY SUBTLE IN THE MANNER 
IN WHICH YOU'RE GOING ABOUT SELLING SOMETHING 
YOU HAVE TO BE INTERESTED IN THE PEOPLE FIRST OF ALL NOT JUST BANG BANG BANG 
BUY MY CAKE BUY MY CAKE 
ONLY TOWARDS THE END I MUST ADMIT IS A FORM OF DESPERATION IN THE LAST HALF AN HOUR WHERE I DID TRY 
THE HARD SELL AS THE SOFTLY APPROACH WASN'T WORKING PEOPLE WOULD SAY WE'LL COME BACK IN TEN MINUTES 
WE'LL HAVE A LOOK AT OTHER STANDS AND NO ONE CAME BACK AND IN THE LAST HALF AN HOUR I MUST ADMIT 
IT WAS A FORM OF DESPERATION WHERE I WAS GOING FOR THE HARD SELL JUST TO SELL ONE OR TWO CAKES 
WE WERE JUST TRYING TO MAKE A SALE SIR ALAN UNFORTUNATELY WE DIDN'T MAKE A SALE 
LISTEN ONE OF YOU'S GONNA GO HERE TODAY RIGHT 
I'VE GOT YOU TWO WHO STOOD AROUND ALL DAY LONG TRYING TO SELL CAKES AND I'VE GOT THIS FELLA HERE 
WHO'S GOT THE APPRECIATION SOCIETY TELLING ME WHAT A WONDERFUL CHAP HE IS RIGHT 
ALEX DOESN'T DESERVE TO GET FIRED SIR ALAN ON THIS OCCASION AT ALL HE PERFORMED BRILLIANTLY ON BOTH DAYS 
HELENE SEEMS TO HAVE MADE HER DECISION ALREADY BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE NEXT PART OF THIS PROCESS 
IS THAT I'M GOING TO ASK HER AS TEAM LEADER TO BRING TWO PEOPLE BACK INTO THIS ROOM 
AM I CORRECT IN ASSUMING IT'S GOING TO BE THOSE TWO SARA AND MICHAEL 
YES SIR ALAN O. K. ALEXANDER 
YOU'VE MANAGED TO ESCAPE AGAIN YOU NOT ONLY CHARMED THE PEOPLE TO BUY 
THE DRESSES OFF HER YOU SEEM TO HAVE A WAY OF CHARMING YOUR TEAMMATES 
MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE YOU DO WORK VERY VERY HARD GO BACK TO THE HOUSE 
YOU THREE STEP OUTSIDE AND I'LL CALL YOU BACK IN SHORTLY WHEN ONE OF YOU WILL GET FIRED 
THIS IS A VERY VERY DIFFICULT ONE BECAUSE TO ME I CAN SEE TWO OF THEM THAT REALLY SHOULD GO THIS WEEK 
I THINK THERE'S REASONS FOR ALL OF THEM TO GO ACTUALLY 
THEY SEEM TO ME TO BE DEAD IN THE WATER BEFORE THEY EVEN GET GOING 
THEY SOLD THE WRONG THINGS THEY HAD THE WRONG THINGS 
YES SIR ALAN 
SIR ALAN WILL SEE YOU NOW 
HELENE IT'S SIMPLE 
YOU CHOSE THE WRONG DRESS DESIGNER 
WELL WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT MY TEAM IS NOBODY STRONGLY ADVOCATED ANYTHING THROUGHOUT THE DAY IN TERMS 
OF HELENE YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT I THINK YOU'RE GOING WRONG GO WITH THE EXPENSIVE DRESSES 
NOBODY STRONGLY ADVOCATED ANYTHING ON THE DAY 
CAN I SAY SOMETHING BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET IRRITATED 
AND HYSTERICAL BUT I'M STARTING TO GET VERY FED UP WITH THIS NOW 
WE LOST THIS TASK FOR ONE REASON AND ONE REASON ONLY PRODUCT SELECTION 
POOR PRODUCT SELECTION O. K. 
YOU WANTED THE CAKES THOUGH RIGHT 
I DID WANT YOU WANTED THE CAKES AND YOU SAW THE DRESSES THAT WON THE DAY FOR THE OTHER TEAM 
WE DID SEE THE DRESSES O. K. SO GO ON POOR PRODUCT SELECTION 
WE COULD HAVE HAD A STRONGER ARGUMENT 
THERE'S ONE IMPORTANT POINT YOU'RE FORGETTING WHEN YOU WERE COMMUNICATING THAT INFORMATION 
SARA YOU WERE TRAINED AS A BARRISTER RIGHT 
IT SEEMS TO ME THE ONLY SKILLS YOU'VE GOT IS DEFENDING YOURSELF 
ALL THE TIME BUT AS YOU KNOW A JUDGE WOULDN'T ALLOW YOU TO KEEP OVERTALKING TO SOMEONE ELSE 
WILL YOU LET HIM FINISH COS I'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME I'LL LISTEN TO WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY I APOLOGISE 
RIGHT O. K. I'VE JUST BEEN LISTENING TO BASICALLY WHAT'S BEEN VEILED 
AS ME BEING PUT IN AS A SCAPEGOAT FOR ALL THIS I'M JUST THINKING 
WHY'S IT A SCAPEGOAT YOU DIDN'T SELL ANYTHING 
YOU WERE THE ONE THAT WENT OUT AND VIEWED THE DRESS THAT WON FOR THE OTHER TEAM WHERE'S THE SCAPEGOAT 
WE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT WE COULDN'T COMPARE IT TO HANG ON A SECOND SARA 
WE SHOULD HAVE GONE FOR THE HIGH END PRODUCTS WHICH I DID ENDORSE BUT I DIDN'T PUT A STRONG ENOUGH ARGUMENT 
YOU'RE SAYING IT'S HER FAULT I AM SAYING IT'S HER FAULT 
LIKE A MUG I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE AND DOUBTING MY SALES ABILITY DO YOU KNOW WHAT 
THERE WERE TENFOLD AS MANY PEOPLE WHO ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE WAY THAT I WAS PRESENTING THOSE CAKES 
THE MAIN PROBLEM IS WE COULDN'T SELL THE CAKES BECAUSE NO ONE WAS INTERESTED IN BUYING THEM 
THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAW HERE WAS THAT THE SALES APPROACH ON THIS 
WAS WRONG IN THE SENSE THAT YOU'RE NOT SELLING DOUBLE GLAZING 
I DIDN'T SELL IT LIKE A HARD SELL DOUBLE GLAZING 
WE TRIED OUR ABSOLUTE BEST TO SELL THOSE CAKES IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT THE FIRST QUESTIONS 
WE ASKED WERE ARE YOU GETTING MARRIED WHO TO REALLY INTERESTED IN THEIR WEDDING 
IT IS NEW IT'S ALL EDIBLE YOU CAN DO THIS TO IT YOU CAN DO THAT 
YOU CAN HAVE DIFFERENT COLOURS PUT IT IN IT'LL BE LIKE A WOW FACTOR AT YOUR WEDDING 
WE EXPLAINED ALL THOSE POINTS IT WAS SO DIFFICULT 
LISTEN I TELL YOU WHAT IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE RECIPIENTS OF YOUR SALES PITCH 
IF IT'S ANYTHING LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW 
I'D HAVE GOT HOLD OF YOUR HEAD AND PUSHED IT IN THE BLOODY CAKE 
SIR ALAN YOU GO OFF LIKE A MACHINE GUN 
WHY I'M HERE IS TO TRY AND WORK OUT WHICH ONE OF YOU IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE ON THIS TASK O. K. 
I THINK IT'S QUITE CLEAR FROM MICHAEL'S POINT OF VIEW YOU'RE PUTTING THE BLAME WITH HELENE 
IS THAT RIGHT AND HELENE WHERE ARE YOU PLACING THE BLAME 
IF I HAD TO I'D PROBABLY PLACE THE BLAME ON SARA 
I SEE O. K. CAN I JUST AND THAT'S MAINLY FOR WHAT REASON 
SHE JUST SOLIDLY CAN I JUST 
SARA I'M SPEAKING YEAH 
YOU WORK VERY HARD BUT YOU SPEAK A. T. PEOPLE YOU DON'T READ BODY LANGUAGE YOU DON'T READ ANYTHING 
YOU JUST SPEAK AT PEOPLE AND I WAS CRINGING WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY ABOUT THAT 
OUT OF THE THREE OF US HELENE HAD THE LEAST CONTRIBUTION 
SHE WAS WEARING THE WEDDING DRESS THROUGHOUT THE DAY BUT WHAT DID YOU ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE THE WHOLE DAY 
I SOLD TWO DRESSES 
IT WAS ACTUALLY A WHOLE TEAM EFFORT OF US SELLING 
IT'S QUITE INTERESTING THAT YOU MENTION THE WORD TEAM BECAUSE IT CLEARLY WASN'T A TEAM 
I THINK I'VE HEARD ENOUGH AND IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THIS 
HELENE THIS TASK WAS LOST ON THE FIRST DAY 
AND IT'S BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T RECOGNISE WHAT THIS WAS ABOUT 
THE CAPTURED AUDIENCE AND THE PASSIONATE CUSTOMERS THAT I PROVIDED 
SARA FOR THE PAST EIGHT WEEKS THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF SUGGESTIONS 
THAT YOU ACTUALLY DON'T DO ANYTHING YOUR ARGUMENTS ARE ALWAYS 
VERY CONFUSING YOU'VE ALIENATED CUSTOMERS IN THIS PARTICULAR TASK AND THAT'S THE FEEDBACK THAT I GOT 
MICHAEL I'VE GOT A LIST AS LONG AS MY ARM ABOUT THE APOLOGIES 
YOU PUTTING YOUR HANDS UP YOU KNOW 
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MORE TIMES I CAN LISTEN TO THAT NONSENSE 
I'M IN A DILEMMA AS TO WHO'S GOING TO GO 
ONE THING I AM SURE WHO'S GOING RIGHT NOW 
SARA YOU'RE FIRED 
MICHAEL I THINK I'VE REACHED THE END OF THE ROAD WITH YOU I'M SORRY 
YOUR ATTITUDE HAS BEEN YES SIR ALAN I GOT THAT WRONG YES SIR ALAN I GOT THIS WRONG 
THERE IS NO ROOM FOR ANY MORE MISTAKES AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED SO 
SIR ALAN CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING PLEASE 
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE I'M BEGGING BUT IF YOU CAN GIVE ME ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY 
TO BE A PROJECT MANAGER AGAIN SHOW YOU WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF I DID A FANTASTIC JOB LAST TIME 
AS PROJECT MANAGER I'VE GOT MORE TO GIVE THAN JUST BEING A SALESMAN I REALLY DO I REALLY REALLY DO 
I WON'T LET YOU DOWN 
GET BACK TO THE HOUSE THE PAIR OF YOU GO ON THEN OFF YOU GO 
TALK ABOUT A CAT WITH NINE LIVES 
SARA I MEAN 
I GAVE HER ENOUGH CHANCES 
IN THE END I THOUGHT TO MYSELF DO I NEED SOMEONE LIKE THIS 
SOUNDING LIKE AN AIR RAID SIREN WORKING FOR ME 
I FIND IT REALLY DIFFICULT TO WORK IN A TEAM HAVING TO WORK WITH TEAM MATES 
THAT YOU DON'T PERSONALLY LIKE DON'T GET ALONG WITH 
I COULD NOT WORK UNDER A PROJECT MANAGER TELLING ME WHAT TO DO 
I COULD NOT HAVE PEOPLE TELLING ME WHAT TO DO SO IN A TEAM ENVIRONMENT I DON'T THINK I'M SO GOOD 
SO I'VE LEARNT THAT I CAN'T DO THAT AND I WILL WORK INDIVIDUALLY AND I WILL BE MY OWN BOSS 
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO GO AND DO 
ON THIS ONE I DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHO'S GOING TO GET FIRED 
I DON'T EITHER NOR DO I 
OH MY GOD OH MY GOD 
ARE YOU HAPPY YEAH 
HOW YOU DOING 
DON'T WANT YOU TO GO HOME YOU ALL RIGHT 
YOU KNOW I DID MAKE A LOT OF MISTAKES ON THIS TASK AND I'VE GOT TO PROVE MYSELF NOW 
IT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE IN THE BOARDROOM AND YOU HAVE TO SAVE YOURSELF 
THERE'S ONE JOB THERE'S SEVEN OF US HERE SIX ARE GOING TO GO AND THAT'S THE REALITY OF IT 
ONE JOB NOW JUST SEVEN CANDIDATES REMAIN 
SIR ALAN'S SEARCH FOR HIS APPRENTICE CONTINUES 
NEXT TIME ON THE APPRENTICE 
YOU'RE GOING TO ADVERTISE TISSUES 
THE TEAMS MUST LAUNCH THEIR BRANDS 
WE COULD CALL OUR BRAND SNOT 
WITH A T. V. AD 
PLENTY OF PASSION IT'S COMING TOGETHER 
ATCHOO WILL THEY THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX 
I DIDN'T FUCKING VOLUNTEER 
OR BE A BOX OFFICE FLOP I WANT TO DIRECT 
ACTION MUM IT LOOKS BAD TO YOU 
YEAH IT LOOKS BAD TO ME 
I DIDN'T SEND YOU OUT TO MAKE A REMAKE OF BEN HUR 
YOU'RE FIRED
