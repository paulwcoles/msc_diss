WE FOUND LOTS OF ANIMALS IN OUR JUNGLE 
YES WE DID 
OH THERE'S THE WINDOWS 
NOW THE JUNGLE IS A VERY HOT PLACE FOR ANIMALS TO LIVE 
BUT SOME ANIMALS CAN LIVE IN ALL SORTS OF WEATHER 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK HOW MANY WINDOWS 
ONE TWO THREE 
ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED 
WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
IT'S THE ROUND WINDOW 
SOME ANIMALS LIVE WHERE THE WEATHER IS ALWAYS HOT 
THESE ARE A TYPE OF LIZARD CALLED AN AGAMA 
THEY CAN'T LIVE WHERE IT IS COLD 
BECAUSE THEY NEED THE HEAT TO KEEP THEIR BODIES WARM 
LIZARDS ARE COLD BLOODED 
THESE LIZARDS LOVE BATHING IN THE SUN 
AND THEY HAVE AN UNUSUAL WAY OF TALKING TO EACH OTHER 
THEY USE THEIR CURLY TAILS TO MAKE SIGNALS 
IT'S A BIT LIKE WAVING BUT INSTEAD OF USING THEIR HANDS TO WAVE 
THESE AGAMAS USE THEIR TAILS 
THESE LIZARDS LIVE WHERE THE WEATHER IS HOT 
THESE PENGUINS LIVE WHERE THE WEATHER IS SNOWY AND COLD 
THEY ALL HAVE TO HUDDLE TOGETHER WHEN THE WIND BLOWS AND IT SNOWS 
THIS IS CALLED A BLIZZARD 
AND IT IS SO COLD AND ICY THE PENGUINS ARE COVERED IN SNOW 
PENGUINS ARE WARM BLOODED AND THEY HAVE A THICK SKIN 
AND ARE NICE AND FAT TO KEEP THEM WARM 
THESE PENGUINS HAVE TO GO FISHING IN THE ICY COLD SEA FOR THEIR SUPPER 
THEY ARE GREAT AT SWIMMING AND THE COLD WATER DOESN'T BOTHER THEM 
THESE PENGUINS LIVE WHERE THE WEATHER IS COLD 
IN SOME PLACES IN THE WORLD 
IT RAINS FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS ON END 
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET OUT OF THE RAIN 
LOOK AT ME I'M SOPPING WET 
BIRDS DON'T MIND THE RAIN TOO MUCH 
THEY HAVE WATERPROOF FEATHERS SO THE RAIN JUST RUNS OFF 
THE FRUIT BATS MANAGE TO KEEP DRY 
BY USING THEIR WINGS AS UMBRELLAS 
THESE BATS LIVE WHERE THE WEATHER IS WET 
YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN THESE ANIMALS BEFORE THEY ARE CAMELS 
CAMELS OFTEN LIVE IN THE DESERT 
WHERE IT IS VERY HOT AND DRY 
THE HUMPS ON THEIR BACKS HAVE FAT IN THEM 
WHICH MEANS THE CAMELS DON'T HAVE TO HAVE FOOD AND WATER FOR A LONG TIME 
BECAUSE DESERTS ARE SO DRY WHEN THE WIND BLOWS 
THERE ARE SANDSTORMS IN A SANDSTORM CAMELS CAN CLOSE THEIR NOSTRILS 
AND THEIR BIG EYELASHES HELP TO KEEP OUT THE SAND 
WHEN CAMELS FIND WATER THEY DRINK LOTS AND LOTS 
THESE CAMELS LIVE WHERE THE WEATHER IS DRY 
ANIMALS LIVE EVERYWHERE WHETHER THE WEATHER IS HOT 
COLD 
WET 
OR DRY 
CAMELS ARE CLEVER AREN'T THEY 
IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE LIVING IN A DESERT WHERE IT HARDLY EVER RAINS 
M. M. M. IT MUST BE REALLY HOT 
NOW CAMELS HAVE HUMPS 
AND THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER ANIMALS WITH SPECIAL BODY PARTS TOO 
NOW I'VE GOT SOME ANIMALS HERE AND I THOUGHT WE'D HAVE A GAME 
WE'VE GOT A PIG AND 
WE'VE GOT AN ELEPHANT YES 
AND A PARROT DOWN HERE 
AND A REINDEER 
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING FROM EACH OF THESE ANIMALS 
THEY'RE ALL MISSING A BODY PART 
WE'VE GOT SOME BODY PARTS DOWN HERE M. M. M. 
SEE IF YOU CAN GUESS WHICH BODY PART IS MISSING 
FROM WHICH ANIMAL RIGHT SHALL WE START YES 
WE'LL GO WITH THE PIG FIRST YES 
SHALL WE O. K. SO THE PIG'S GOT SOME EARS MM HMM 
AND SOME TROTTERS WHICH ARE HIS FEET 
WE'VE GOT A NOSE 
SO WHAT'S MISSING 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK DOWN HERE 
ANY IDEAS 
WELL I THINK IT COULD BE THIS CURLY 
PINK TAIL SHALL I GIVE IT A GO 
LET'S SEE IF THAT FITS 
AH 
YES OH YES IT WAS A TAIL IT WAS THE TAIL 
NOW THEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK WHAT ABOUT 
THE ELEPHANT 
NOW THE ELEPHANT'S GOT A TAIL AND SOME LEGS 
AND LOVELY BIG EARS 
AND SOME STRONG TUSKS 
M. M. M. 
AND WHAT'S DOWN HERE 
WE'VE GOT THAT'S A BIT TOO COLOURFUL FOR AN ELEPHANT 
AND NO 
AH 
BUT THIS LONG GREY THING THAT LOOKS A BIT LIKE 
A LONG TRUNK 
AND ELEPHANTS HAVE TRUNKS SO I THINK SHALL WE HAVE A LOOK 
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS THE ELEPHANT WAS MISSING HIS TRUNK IT WAS 
IT'S THE PARROT NOW YES 
THE PARROT'S GOT SOME LOVELY YELLOW FEET SOME CLAWS M. M. M. 
IT'S GOT A BEAK YES 
IT'S GOT A BIG FLUFFY FEATHER ON THE CROWN OF ITS HEAD 
SO WHAT'S MISSING FROM THE PARROT WHAT HAVE WE GOT LEFT 
WE'VE GOT THESE KIND OF STICK LOOKING THINGS AND 
AH WHAT'S THIS OVER HERE 
IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE PARROT'S MISSING A TAIL 
DO YOU THINK THAT THIS 
COULD BE THE PARROT'S TAIL 
NO I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK I THINK IT'S THIS BIG COLOURFUL BUSHY TAIL OVER HERE 
LET'S GIVE THAT A GO SHALL WE I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT JUSTIN 
THERE IT IS THAT'S BEAUTIFUL 
SQUAWK GOT ME TAIL BACK GOT ME TAIL BACK 
NOW WE'VE GOT THE REINDEER LEFT 
ON THIS REINDEER YOU'VE GOT A NICE NOSE THERE 
AND YOU'VE GOT SOME EARS AND A LITTLE FLUFFY TAIL 
AND FOUR LEGS 
BUT WHAT DO REINDEER HAVE 
ON THEIR HEADS 
H. M. M. DO YOU KNOW 
THEY LOOK A BIT LIKE BRANCHES 
AND THEY'RE CALLED 
ANTLERS AND I THINK AHA 
THERE'S THE REINDEER 
WITH HIS MAGNIFICENT ANTLERS YEAH 
I THINK WE'VE DONE IT WE HAVE SO WE'VE GOT A PIG 
WITH A CURLY TAIL 
WE'VE GOT AN ELEPHANT WITH A VERY LONG TRUNK 
WE'VE GOT A PARROT WITH A BEAUTIFUL BUSHY COLOURFUL TAIL 
AND WE'VE GOT A REINDEER WITH MAGNIFICENT ANTLERS 
DID YOU GUESS THEM

WELL I'M GOING TO MAKE A CABIN BED TODAY 
NOW FOR THE BED I'M GOING TO USE 
AN OLD TISSUE BOX

IS JUST RIP THE INSIDE OF THE BOX LIKE THIS 
ALL THE WAY AROUND THE EDGE 
YOU MIGHT NEED TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF HELP WITH THIS 
BECAUSE IT CAN BE A BIT STIFF 
YOU KNOW WHAT 
IT'S A BIT LIKE PEELING AN ORANGE ISN'T IT

AND THIS IS GOING TO BE THE TOP OF YOUR BED 
THERE 
RIGHT PUT THAT BIT OF ORANGE PEEL OVER THERE 
NOW PUT THE BED TO ONE SIDE
