DIFFERENT DAIRIES WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT STAMPS 
THEY'RE REALLY INTRICATELY CARVED WITH THESE LOVELY LITTLE PATTERNS

GREAT PIECES OF KITCHENALIA LET'S SEE WHAT THE STALLHOLDER SAYS EXCUSE ME CAN WE PICK YOUR BRAINS

TRY AND GET A GOOD PRICE FROM HIM 
THIS IS THE MAN THAT KNOWS 
KNOWS WHERE THEY CAME FROM WHERE DID THESE COME FROM HEREFORDSHIRE 
HEREFORDSHIRE YES A LITTLE FARM THAT WE WENT TO AND IT HAD ALL THESE LITTLE FARM SALES 
WHICH ARE VERY RARE THESE DAYS AND A COUPLE OF OLD BOYS WERE THERE 
AND THEY WERE SELLING THINGS AND THAT'S WHERE THEY CAME FROM WE'VE HAD THEM ABOUT EIGHT YEARS 
I THINK THESE ARE QUITE NICE 
ARE YOU GOING TO DO A NICE LITTLE DEAL ON THESE WHAT ABOUT SIXTY SIXTY TWO 
SIXTY TWO IS AN ODD NUMBER BUT IT GIVES ME A LITTLE BIT PROFIT AND YOU'VE GOT A BARGAIN ALL RIGHT 
THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE MONEY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT I THINK I'D BE INTERESTED AT THAT PRICE 
YEAH SOUNDS O. K. 
I SHOULD BE VERY SICK ACTUALLY IF YOU MAKE A VAST PROFIT 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING 
THE BUTTER MOULDS GOT THE STAMP OF APPROVAL FOR SIXTY TWO 
ANYTHING CATCHES YOUR EYE 
CATCHES YOUR EYE YOU'RE REALLY KEEN ON SOMETHING 
SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT USE IN THE HOUSE 
WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS JAMES 
THAT'S AN UNUSUAL CHOICE FOR YOU GUMP I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHOWING MY FEMININE SIDE 
YES QUITE YOU'RE VERY APTLY DEMONSTRATING IT 
EVERY WOMAN LOVES A SWEET SMELLING GENT THAT'S SWEET ALL RIGHT 
I SMELL LOVELY NOW WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE HODGE 
PERFUME IT STILL WORKS FABULOUS GLASS 
IS IT SIGNED ON THE BASE 
SEEMS TO BE A SMALL SIGNATURE PASS IT OVER 
YOU NEVER KNOW I MIGHT RECOGNISE IT 
IT'S IN SCRIPT BUT IT SAYS ROYAL BRIERLEY STUDIO 
RECOGNISED RECOGNISED YES 
THE WORLD OVER THIS IS MARKETABLE 
WE HAVE A TREASURE 
IT'S COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS STUDIO GLASS 
THIS IS RATHER NICE IT'S SORT OF FAVRILE SORT OF TIFFANY'S 
IT'S ALMOST AS IF THEY'VE LAID OIL IN THE GLASS 
EXACTLY IT'S THIS IRIDESCENCE ISN'T IT 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE SLICK ON CHATHAM DOCKYARDS 
SOMEBODY DISCHARGING DIESEL LIBERALLY DO YOU THINK WE'D MAKE A PROFIT I HAVEN'T A CLUE 
THERE YOU HAVE ME HODGE WE WANT TO MAKE A PROFIT I THINK YOU WILL 
IF WE CAN GET THAT AT SORT OF BETWEEN TEN AND TWENTY SOMEBODY WILL GO FOR IT IT WORKS 
IS THIS SOMETHING YOU BUY NORMALLY GUMP 
NO NOT PERSONALLY YES YOU DO 
BEHIND THE EARS IT CAUGHT THE EYE IT CAUGHT THE EYE I THINK YOU'VE DONE WELL 
I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE BEST ITEM ON THIS TABLE THAT'S FOR SURE 
IF WE CAN DO SOME NEGOTIATING 
WHO'S GOING TO NEGOTIATE THEN GO ON YOU CAN I'LL HAVE A GO YOU'RE HEAD OF PURCHASING 
IS IT GOING TO BE OUR WINNER ARE WE GOING TO SNIFF SOMETHING 
I SMELL A PROFIT 
GUMP GAZUNDERED THE ATOMISER FOR EIGHTEEN 
NOW LOOK OUT THOSE RED COWBOYS ARE UP TO NO GOOD 
AH BLOWLAMPS 
RIGHT STICK 'EM UP BANG BANG 
BOYS COME ON WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO PUT THEM BACK 
DO YOU FEEL A ROMANTIC MOMENT COMING ON 
HAVE YOU JUST HAD A ROMANTIC MOMENT THAT YOU WANT TO RECORD FOR ALL TIME 
YOU WANT TO GIVE HER A LITTLE GIFT FOR THAT SPECIAL SPECIAL TIME YOU'VE SHARED 
WELL TRY THIS LITTLE FELLOW ON FOR SIZE DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S SWEET 
IT'S MADE OF SOLID SILVER IT WAS HALLMARKED IN BIRMINGHAM IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
AND OF COURSE IT'S IN THE SHAPE OF A HEART 
A HEART WITH A BAR IN THE MIDDLE WHERE THE HALLMARK IS 
AND THE IDEA BEING THAT YOU'D WIND A RIBBON THROUGH THAT 
AND SHE'D TIE IT AROUND HER BOSOM OR WAIST 
OR JUST STICK IT IN HER HAIR 
MARVELLOUS SHE'D BE SO IMPRESSED BELIEVE ME SHE'D LOVE YOU FOREVER 
THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER IS NOT TO TELL HER HOW MUCH YOU PAID FOR IT IN THE FAIR 
BECAUSE THIS THING HAS JUST COST ME THREE QUID 
THERE'S SOME PLATES THERE THEY LOOK GOOD 
GLADSTONE DISRAELI 
THEY GO TOGETHER AS A PAIR DON'T THEY THEY'RE CONTEMPORARY POLITICIANS 
GOT A BIT OF WEAR THEY'VE LOST THEIR I COULD SEE SOMEBODY BUYING THOSE COULD YOU 
I COULD SEE PEOPLE HAVING THE PAIR ON THEIR WALL SHOWING THEIR FRIENDS BY THE FRONT DOOR AS THEY COME IN 
TALKING PIECES EXACTLY IN THE ENTRANCE HALL 
THEY DON'T DO IT FOR ME I'M AFRAID WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT THEM 
THEY'RE INTERESTING FROM A HISTORICAL POINT OF VIEW THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF INFORMATION ON THERE AND THE AGE 
THIS ONE IS SLIGHTLY MORE DECORATIVE I'M MORE INTERESTED IN THAT ONE THAN THIS ONE I THINK 
HAVE THEY GOT THE SAME POTTERY THEY WOULD BE LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
NESTLE AND AMP HUNTSMAN THEY'RE QUITE SIMPLE 
VALUE WISE THEY'VE PUT ON THEM ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN FOR THE PAIR I THINK THAT IS A BIT STEEP TO BE HONEST 
BUT ONLY IF WE GOT THEM AS A PAIR WOULD THAT AFFECT THE VALUE 
THERE WOULD'VE BEEN A WHOLE RANGE OF THESE AND IF PEOPLE COLLECT THEM 
THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE THIS ONE IN THEIR PARTICULAR COLLECTION 
SO IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO BUY THEM SEPARATELY 
TOP PRICE TOGETHER PEOPLE WOULD PAY MAYBE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
IF WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF PEOPLE IN THE SALEROOM WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THESE HISTORICAL PIECES 
I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO COLLECTS POLITICAL FIGURES 
YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE THEM A RING AND TELL HIM TO COME DOWN 
I WILL GO AND WORK YOUR MAGIC SEE WHAT WE CAN DO 
GO AND GET YOUR BEST PRICE AND LET'S GO FOR THEM O. K. WE'LL GIVE IT A TRY 
THE DEALER WAS HANDED ONE HUNDRED ON A PLATE FOR THE PAIR 
WANT TO FIND THE BEST ANTIQUES 
WELL YOU COULD CYCLE DOWN THE SUPERHIGHWAY OR YOU COULD SURF A BESPOKE WEBSITE 
OURS 
IT WILL LEAD YOU TO THE VERY BEST FAIRS LIKE THIS ONE 
WITHOUT A BEAD OF SWEAT TRY IT GIVE IT A SPIN 
NOW THOSE BLUES ARE LOOKING A BIT TOO LAID BACK FOR MY LIKING 
NICE DAY FOR THIS ISN'T IT 
LOVELY 
COME ON WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH ALL THESE MUSHROOMS HERE BOYS 
I'VE GOT SOME REAL STUFF WHO FANCIES A CIDER 
A SWEET IDEA IT'S A GOOD FELLOW ISN'T IT WHAT A GREAT SHAPE 
IMAGINE BLOWING A BIT OF GLASS THAT SIZE 
HAVE TO HAVE SOME PUFF HAVE TO HAVE SOME BIG LUNGS 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT I DON'T THINK IT'S THE PRETTIEST OF OBJECTS 
BUT IT IS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF GLASS IT'S STARTING TO GROW ON ME 
WHAT DO YOU THINK I PAID FOR THIS 
IT'S QUITE BIG IT'S GLASS IT'S GOT SOME AGE 
HAND BLOWN IT'S GOT SOME LOVELY DIMPLES NO MORE THAN THIRTY I HOPE

CAN YOU IMPROVE ON THAT HODGE 
FIFTEEN FIFTEEN CLOSE CLOSE

I THINK IT IS IT'S BOUGHT IT'S DONE IT'S OUR SECOND ITEM WHAT WOULD IT ACTUALLY BE USED FOR 
STORAGE STORAGE OF WHAT COINS 
YEAH YOU SEE THEM WITH COINS IN THEM DON'T YOU 
I DON'T THINK NECESSARILY FOR COINS 
I THINK PEOPLE USED TO HAVE THESE AND HAVE MINIATURE GARDENS IN THEM 
YOU HAD THESE FUNNY TOOLS LONG FORKS AND SPADES THAT YOU COULD DO 
AND PEOPLE GREW THINGS IN THEM 
DO THINK I COULD GROW THESE MUSHROOMS IN IT YOU PROBABLY COULD PERFECT 
SWEET 
THERE ARE SOME PRETTY WACKY THINGS IN THESE FAIRS 
YOUR CHALLENGE IS TO TELL ME WHAT IS THIS 
WELL IT'S MADE OF STONEWARE THAT'S THICK POTTERY 
IT'S HEAVY IT'S GOT A HOLE IN THE TOP 
IT'S IN THE SHAPE OF A PIECE OF CHEESE 
WITH LUGS ON THE SIDE 
IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE LUGS THEY'RE ACTUALLY MADE OF BITS OF 
CLAY THAT LOOK LIKE BITS OF METAL SCREWS WITH SCREW HEADS ON 
WEIRD ISN'T IT 
IT'S ALL VERY WELL TALKING ABOUT HAVING COLD FEET ON BARGAIN HUNT 
ON A LOVELY WARM DAY LIKE THIS BUT IF YOU WERE TRAVELLING AROUND IN YOUR CARRIAGE IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY 
AND YOU HAD A PROBLEM WITH CHILBLAINS YOU'D WANT TO WARM YOUR TOOTSIES UP WOULDN'T YOU 
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS IT'S A VERY RARE AND RATHER WACKY FOOT WARMER 
YOU PUT BOILING HOT WATER IN THERE 
AND FILL THAT UP WITH A BUNG OR A CORK AND JUST TO STOP THE 
THING MOVING AROUND IN THE BOTTOM OF YOUR CARRIAGE 
YOU TAKE A PIECE OF WEBBING FEED IT THROUGH THOSE LUGS 
AND STRAP IT DOWN SO THE THING WOULDN'T MOVE 
AND YOUR FEET WOULD BE AS WARM AS TOAST 
WHO WANTS THIS THING TODAY I HEAR YOU ASK WELL I DON'T KNOW 
ALL THE STALLHOLDER WANTS IS FIFTY FIVE 
I'VE GOT A BIKE YOU CAN RIDE IT IF YOU LIKE 
IT'S GOT A BASKET A BELL THAT RINGS 
AND THINGS TO MAKE IT LOOK GOOD 
I'D GIVE IT TO YOU IF I COULD BUT I BORROWED IT 
IT'S A WRITING DESK ISN'T IT 
I LOVE THOSE 
THIS IS WHAT I COLLECT I'M INTERESTED IN THESE 
YOU WERE LOOKING AT SOMETHING LIKE THAT EARLIER THAT'S RATHER NICE

A LATE VICTORIAN STATIONERY CUPBOARD 
WE'VE GOT OUR PEN TRAY DOWN HERE 
THEN FLANKED BY THE TWO LITTLE GLASS INKWELLS 
DIFFERENT COLOURS RED AND BLACK BOTH IN GOOD NICK ACTUALLY NO REAL DAMAGE 
OBVIOUSLY YOU'D SLOT YOUR PIECES OF STATIONERY IN HERE AND YOUR STAMPS AND OTHER PIECES OF PAPER IN HERE 
I THINK THAT'S RATHER NICE 
I LIKED THE PIECE OVERALL I'M JUST CONCERNED 
THIS DRAWER HERE NO THAT'S BEEN AGED 
IF YOU LOOK THAT'S BEEN BRUSHED 
A BIT OF BRUSHWORK ON HERE THAT'S BEEN AGED 
IT'S BETTER THAN NO DRAWER AT ALL 
SLIGHTLY NOT SURE ABOUT THAT 
BUT APART FROM THAT IT'S A RATHER NICE PIECE 
VERY PRACTICAL AS WELL 
THE PENS GO IN THE FRONT 
IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD GO FOR 
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A WRITING DESK FOR YEARS 
THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD SIGN 
I THINK THIS IS RATHER NICE QUALITY 
YOU CAN CARRY IT FROM ROOM TO ROOM AS WELL 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT ON THIS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY 
WOW THAT IS A LOT CONSIDERING THE DRAWER IS BRAND NEW 
I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO GO A LOT LOWER ON THAT

THERE WE ARE LO AND BEHOLD THERE IS THE BRETBY MARK SUNBURST GREAT ITEM 
NOW WHO WOULD HAVE OWNED THIS

THIS FACTORY MADE WARES FROM ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE TO NINETEEN TWENTY 
HAVE A FEEL OF THAT 
COR BLIMEY THERE'S SOME WEIGHT THERE

PROBABLY ABOUT THE SAME WHAT PRICE IS IT 
HE WANTED SIXTY FIVE I PAID FIFTY

CHEERS NO I THINK YOU'VE DONE WELL 
I THINK THIS WILL MAKE BETWEEN FIFTY AND ONE HUNDRED AT AUCTION 
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD MAKE 
IT'S QUITE VICTORIAN I LIKE THE COLOUR 
MAINLY THEY'RE ALWAYS GREEN AND BROWN BORING COLOURS 
BUT YOU'VE GONE FOR A PINK ALMOST A SANG DE BOEUF 
IS THIS IS A RARE ONE 
I THINK IT'S RARE DO YOU THINK WE CAN MAKE SOME MONEY ON THIS 
I THINK WE'RE IN A GOOD POSITION GOOD 
LET'S JUST SIT DOWN AND CHILL 
HODGE I'M AFRAID TO SAY YOU LOOK A BIT LIKE A GNOME COS OF THE HAT 
NO IT'S BECAUSE OF THE BEARD 
NOW WHERE ARE THOSE CYCLISTS

AND THEY SHOULD BE COUNTING THEIR LEFTOVER LOLLY 
BECAUSE THIS IS THE MOMENT WHEN JAMES AND CATHERINE WILL GO AND BUY THEM A BONUS BUY

NOW I WONDER WHAT THE REDS DID BUY

I THINK YOU WILL HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING IN MIND 
YES I'VE SEEN SOMETHING THAT WILL GET US ON THE HOOF I THINK 
REALLY WELL OFF YOU TROT THEN VERY VERY GOOD 
WE'LL SEE YOU GUYS AT THE AUCTION 
MEANWHILE THERE ARE MORE WHEELS SPINNING AROUND THE CORNER 
HERE IN MY CAR I FEEL SAFEST OF ALL 
I CAN LOCK ALL MY DOORS 
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO LIVE 
IN CARS 
I ROLLED UP AT THE HOP FARM COUNTRY PARK'S MOTORING PAGEANT HERE IN KENT 
AND I'M SURROUNDED BY AN AMAZING ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DIFFERENT VEHICLES 
I MAY BE AN ANTIQUES EXPERT 
BUT I'VE GOT A THING OR TWO TO LEARN ABOUT MOTOR CARS 
TODAY THERE ARE OVER NINETEEN CATEGORIES 
AUTOMOTIVE HISTORY IS GENERALLY DIVIDED INTO THREE ERAS 
BASED ON THE BIG CHANGES IN DESIGN IN THE LAST CENTURY 
THE THREE ERAS ARE VETERAN VINTAGE AND CLASSIC 
I'M GOING TO FIND OUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM 
FIRST OF ALL THE OLDEST VETERAN 
ANYTHING BEFORE NINETEEN OH FOUR IS CLASSED AS VETERAN 
LIKE THESE MARVELLOUS VEHICLES IN THE LONDON TO BRIGHTON RUN 
NEXT IS VINTAGE THAT'S ANY MOTOR CAR MADE BEFORE NINETEEN THIRTY 
THIS FELLOW WAS MADE IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE BY MORRIS SO IT FITS THE CATEGORY 
IF YOU WERE ABLE TO TOUCH THE SURFACE YOU'D FIND IT'S ALL SOFT AND SQUASHY 
THAT'S BECAUSE THIS IS A RARE FABRIC BODIED MOTOR CAR 
THIS ONE HAS GOT AN ASH FRAME AND THAT SQUASHY SURFACE 
IS SUPPOSED TO BE REXINE WHICH IS A TYPE OF OILED CLOTH 
IF I TAKE A LITTLE PERCH INSIDE THIS FAMILY MOTOR KIND OF SMELLS OF PETROL ACTUALLY 
IF YOU HAD A VENTILATION PROBLEM ON A DAY LIKE THIS IN THE SUMMER 
YOU'D SIMPLY HINGE OPEN YOUR WINDSCREEN LIKE THAT 
AND A LOVELY BREATH OF COOL WIND WOULD COME THROUGH 
IF YOU WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW HOT THE ENGINE WAS 
YOU'D LOOK AT THIS CHAP ON THE END OF THE RADIATOR 
IT'S CALLED A CALORIMETER 
THAT WOULD TELL YOU WHETHER YOU'RE COOL NORMAL OR BOILING 
PERSONALLY I'M BOILING UP IN THIS HEAT 
NOW SHALL WE SEE IF WE CAN START IT UP 
TAKE IT FROM HERE 
GET THE OLD STARTING HANDLE IN ANYTHING LIKE THE RIGHT POSITION LIKE THIS 
AH BINGO 
PERSONALLY I THINK I'LL STICK TO THE ELECTRIC STARTING MOTOR 
WHICH I MIGHT FIND NEXT IN THE CLASSIC CATEGORY 
BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE CATEGORY OF CLASSIC 
IN THIS PAGEANT THEY'VE GOT A CATEGORY OF CLASSIC FROM NINETEEN THIRTY ONE TO NINETEEN FORTY FIVE 
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT THIS GORGEOUS JOB WAS MADE IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE 
IT WAS MADE BY TRIUMPH AND IT'S CALLED A DOLOMITE 
FOR ME THE BEST FEATURE OF THIS MOTOR HAPPENS TO BE ITS DICKY SEAT 
OPEN THAT UP AND YOU'VE GOT TWO EXTRA SEATS FOR THE NIPPERS IN THE BACK 
NOW FOR THE FINAL CATEGORY OF CLASSIC 
ROUND ROUND GET AROUND 
I GET AROUND YEAH I GET AROUND OOH OOH 
I GET AROUND 
FOR ME THE CLASSIC CLASSIC CAR SHOULD DATE FROM THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
AND IF I CAN MAKE MYSELF HEARD ABOVE THE ARENA 
AND PARADE OF CARS BEHIND ME WE'LL HAVE A LOOK AT THIS JOKER 
JEANETTE TELL US ABOUT THIS CAR THIS IS A TRIUMPH VITESSE MARK TWO CONVERTIBLE DATING FROM WHEN 
NINETEEN SIXTY NINE AND WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT THIS VEHICLE 
TRIUMPHS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MY KIND OF CAR 
IT'S SOMETHING I ALWAYS WANTED TO OWN OBVIOUSLY WHEN I WAS YOUNGER 
THEN AS YOU GET OLDER THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES 
AND WHEN WE SAW THIS FOR SALE REALLY I THINK IT HAD MY NAME ON IT 
IT'S PURE NOSTALGIA ISN'T IT 
ONCE UPON A TIME MY DAD HAD ONE OF THESE EXACTLY THE SAME OPEN TOPPED 
ALL OF A SUDDEN ONE IS TAKEN BACK IN TIME 
ANY CHANCE OF YOU GIVING ME A LIFT TO THE AUCTION ROOM 
TIM I WILL TAKE YOU ANYWHERE YOU LIKE OH THERE'S AN OFFER OFF WE GO THEN 
WE'RE CRUISING INTO CANTERBURY TODAY TO SELL OUR WARES 
STAND BY FOR THE BEST BIT THE AUCTION 
IT'S NICE TO BE AT THE CANTERBURY AUCTION ROOMS WITH MICHAEL ROBERTS 
TODAY'S AUCTIONEER HELLO NICE TO MEET YOU TIM VERY NICE TO BE HERE 
NOW PETER AND JOHN WITH CATHERINE SOUTHERN WENT VERY STRONGLY ON THESE 
WOODEN BUTTER PADS ARE THEY ANY GOOD 
WELL WITH THE WOODWORM AND THE CRACKS 
I THINK PERHAPS THEY MIGHT STRUGGLE A LITTLE BIT 
REALLY WHAT'S YOUR ESTIMATE 
WE'RE TWENTY TO THIRTY ON THESE 
OH DEAR SIXTY TWO THEY PAID 
I THINK PERHAPS THAT MIGHT BE A BIT KIND DO YOU YES 
WHAT YOU THINK IT MIGHT MAKE TEN 
I WOULDN'T LIKE TO SAY BUT WE'LL DO OUR BEST I KNOW YOU WILL 
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT SIXTY TWO WORTH AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED 
NO OH DEAR OH DEAR RIGHT LET'S HOPE FOR THE COMMEMORATIVE PLATES 
THE PROBLEM WITH THOSE IS THAT THEY'RE MONOCHROME AREN'T THEY 
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A BIT OF COLOUR IN THEM 
AND THE MARKET IN COMMEMORATIVES HAS PLUMMETED A BIT HAS IT YES 
OH DEAR SO HOW MUCH FOR THESE TWO 
WE'VE ESTIMATED THEM AT FORTY SIXTY OH MY LORD ONE HUNDRED THEY PAID 
FORTY TO SIXTY FOR THOSE TWO O. K. FINE 
WHAT ABOUT THIS STATIONERY CABINET 
IT LOOKS GOOD FROM A DISTANCE 
BUT THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH IT IS THE LATER DRAWER 
THAT'S GOING TO KNOCK THE VALUE A BIT ISN'T IT I'D SAY SO 
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK MICHAEL 
OUR ESTIMATE IS FIFTY TO SEVENTY 
ONE HUNDRED PAID 
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED THEIR EXPERT'S BONUS BUY 
PETER JOHN CATHERINE 
NOW YOU SPENT TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO YES 
AND CATHERINE THEREFORE HAD THIRTY EIGHT TO SPEND 
WHAT DID SHE SPEND IT ON ON YOUR BONUS BUY 
CATHERINE REVEAL ALL DARLING DAH DAH 
OH 
INTERESTING 
YOU KNOW ME TIM I ALWAYS LIKE SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT QUIRKY YES 
I ACTUALLY PICKED THIS BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS AN INTERESTING PIECE 
IT'S AN INHALER 
A POTTERY INHALER MADE FOR BOOTS DURING THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY 
I PICKED IT MORE AS A DECORATIVE PIECE FOR THE BATHROOM OF THE FUTURE 
WE'VE GOT THIS LOVELY TRANSFER PRINTED DIRECTIONS ON HERE 
WE'VE GOT THE CORK ON THE TOP AND THE MOUTHPIECE ON THE SIDE 
IT'S GOT THIS LOVELY MARBLING PATTERN ALL OVER WHAT DO YOU THINK HAVE A LOOK 
IT'S LOVELY HAVE AN INHALE 
IT LOOKS LIKE BRAND NEW 
HOW OLD IS IT MAYBE SORT OF NINETEEN TWENTIES NINETEEN THIRTIES I COULD USE IT MYSELF 
I LIKE SORT OF SCIENCEY THINGS SO IT APPEALED TO ME 
WHAT DID YOU SPEND ON IT CATHERINE 
WELL I PAID THIRTY FOR IT 
AND HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK WE'LL GET FOR IT 
PROBABLY IF WE MAKE ANYTHING TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST WE'LL PROBABLY MAKE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT 
WE MIGHT HAVE FORTY I DON'T KNOW 
SO MAYBE TEN PROFIT 
H. M. M. MIGHT BE OUR SAVIOUR BUT ISN'T IT A GREAT PIECE 
A GREAT PIECE TO HAVE IN YOUR BATHROOM 
IT'S VERY ATTRACTIVE AND INTERESTING 
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THOUGHT 
SO MICHAEL DO YOU FANCY A PUFF 
I SAW THIS AND I TOOK A DEEP BREATH 
HA HA I BET YOU DID FRANKLY IT'S PRETTY MUNDANE 
GOOD CONDITION BUT NOT TERRIBLY EXCITING IS IT 
NOT REALLY NO 
IT IS MEDICAL AND PEOPLE LIKE MEDICAL THINGS DON'T THEY 
TRUE TRUE BUT IT'S JUST AN ORDINARY OBJECT FROM BOOTS THE CHEMIST 
FROM BOOTS THE CHEMIST NICE AD FOR THEM 
O. K. FINE HOW MUCH 
OUR ESTIMATE IS TEN TO FIFTEEN 
THIRTY CATHERINE PAID 
AND SHE SEES A PROFIT IN THAT YOU CLEARLY DON'T I'M AFRAID NOT NO 
RIGHT FAIR ENOUGH NOW FOR THE BLUES 
THE ROYAL BRIERLEY STUDIO GLASS ATOMISER 
DO YOU RATE THAT MICHAEL IT'S GOOD QUALITY 
IT'S A USEFUL THING BUT IT'S NOT VERY OLD 
HOW OLD DO YOU THINK 
RELATIVELY RECENT A DECADE OR SO PERHAPS 
WELL THAT'S QUITE OLD ISN'T IT 
NO NOT THAT OLD YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
O. K. FINE SO NINETEEN SIXTIES MAYBE THEN 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT YES AND HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH 
WE'VE ESTIMATED AT TEN TO FIFTEEN THAT'S NOT TOO BAD EIGHTEEN THEY PAID 
STANDS A REASONABLE CHANCE PERHAPS 
THIS SO CALLED END OF DAY FLAGON THAT'S NOT END OF DAY IS IT 
IT'S A CARBOY ISN'T IT YEAH IT'S TOO BIG TO BE AN END OF DAY PIECE 
SO CHEAPLY BLOWN TO KEEP ACID OR VINEGAR OR SOME STORAGE TYPE JAR ANYWAY 
IT WOULD LOOK QUITE GOOD WITH A CACTUS INSIDE IN A CONSERVATORY OR SOMETHING OR MAKE INTO A LAMP 
IT'S A GREAT LUMP OF GLASS AND IT'S A PRETTY ATTRACTIVE THING 
THEY PAID EIGHTEEN RIGHT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH OUR ESTIMATE IS TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE 
THAT'S JOLLY GOOD SO WE'RE IN WITH A POTENTIAL PROFIT THERE POSSIBLY 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS JARDINIERE STAND PITY ABOUT THE CHIP ISN'T IT 
IT IS IT'S TYPICAL VICTORIAN SORT OF DESIGN IT JUST LACKS THE JARDINIERE AND THE ASPIDISTRA 
BUT IT'S A GOOD THING WELL MOULDED 
AGAIN OUR ESTIMATE IS TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE 
RIGHT FIFTY THEY PAID YOU SEE 
I'D BE A BIT IFFY ABOUT THAT WITHOUT THE JARDINIERE 
WHAT'S THE GOOD WITHOUT THE TOP 
INDEED INDEED BUT HOPEFULLY SOMEONE'S GOT A JARDINIERE TO MATCH WITH IT PERHAPS 
AH NOW YOU'VE GOT WISHFUL THINKING

AND IT'S A PIN CUSHION AND WE'VE GOT A RATHER NICE SILVER THING HERE 
THE HOOF HERE WHICH IS IN PLATE BY A MAKER CALLED ROLAND HILL OF PICCADILLY 
EVEN ROLAND WARD 
THAT'S THE ONE 
I WAS THINKING OF WILLIAM HILL 
YOUR FAVOURITE VISITATION ON THE HIGH STREET 
YES HOME FROM HOME WHAT DO YOU THINK 
HANDLE THE MERCHANDISE 
IT'S A TYPICAL BIT OF COUNTRY HOUSE KIT IT IS 
IF YOU WERE KEEN ON RACING THEY LIKED TO PRESERVE SOME PART OF A FAVOURITE ANIMAL 
WHAT DO YOU THINK GUYS WINNER OR LOSER 
I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S A BIT OF A LOSER BECAUSE IT'S ONLY HIS FOOT 
WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR THAT SORT OF MONEY THE WHOLE HORSE YEAH 
DO YOU WANT BLOOD PREFERABLY YES 
I LIKE IT FOR THE FACT THAT IT'S SHINY 
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF IT BEING A DEAD ANIMAL'S FOOT 
DON'T YOU NO IT IS RATHER INTEGRAL TO THE PIECE THE HOOF 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEN HODGE YOU LIKE IT 
NOT REALLY BUT IF IT'S GOING TO MAKE US A PROFIT I'D LOVE IT 
THERE IS ONE VITAL QUESTION TO ASK 
THAT IS HOW MUCH DID BRAXTON SPEND 
HE HAD TWO HUNDRED FOURTEEN HOW MUCH DID YOU SPEND JAMES WISELY FIFTY THREE 
IS IT GOING TO MAKE A PROFIT 
I THINK IT SHOULD IT'S QUALITY AND IT'S A GOOD MAKER 
NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE NOW YOU DECIDE AFTER THE SALE OF YOUR FIRST THREE ITEMS 
SO LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THOUGHT 
ANY HORSE RACING SLASH FANCYING CUSTOMERS COME TO YOUR SALEROOM 
A FEW BUT I'M A HORSE RIDER MYSELF AND I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T HAVE IT IN MY HOUSE WOULDN'T YOU MACABRE 
IT'S A GOOD NAME ROLAND WARD IT'S A WELL PLATED THING 
YES 
I DON'T KNOW I THINK SOMEBODY PROBABLY HAD THIS MADE BECAUSE THEY LOVED THEIR HORSE SO MUCH 
WELL YES THAT WHEN IT PASSED ON THEY HAD TO HAVE A MEMENTO OF IT 
WHICH I THINK IS QUITE SWEET 
PERHAPS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS TERRIBLY POPULAR NOW MAYBE 
MAYBE NOT ABSOLUTELY RIGHT BUT A NICE PLACE TO PUT YOUR PINS IN 
YES 
WHAT'S YOUR ESTIMATE THIRTY FIVE TO FIFTY 
O. K. FIFTY THREE PAID 
JAMES SEES A PROFIT IN THAT WHO KNOWS HE MIGHT BE RIGHT YES 
I HOPE SO WELL WE'D BETTER CANTER O. R. F. AND SEE YOU AT THE AUCTION 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THESE TWO SWEET LITTLE FELLOWS 
TWO CHARMING LITTLE TOY TEDDY BEARS 
THEY'RE ARTICULATED THAT MEANS THEIR ARMS AND LEGS MOVE 
THEY'RE MADE OF BLOND PLUSH 
AND IF I TURN THIS ONE OVER YOU CAN SEE THAT LOVELY GOLDEN COLOUR SCHEME THERE 
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE TRUE COLOUR THAT COVERED BOTH OF THESE BEARS 
BUT THEY'VE GONE BROWN AND MUCKY LIKE THAT BECAUSE DUST HAS SETTLED ON THEM OVER THE YEARS 
CHARMING AREN'T THEY THEY'VE GOT NICE SEWN UP NOSES 
THAT'S NEEDLE WORKED AND BUTTON EYES 
AND RESEMBLE VERY CLOSELY THE WORK OF MR. STEIFF 
THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY ORIGINAL MAKER OF THESE LITTLE BEARS 
IF THEY'D BEEN STEIFF THEY OUGHT TO HAVE A LITTLE BUTTON IN THEIR EAR HOLES WHICH THEY HAVEN'T GOT 
IN FACT THIS ONE HAS HARDLY GOT AN EAR HOLE ON THIS SIDE AT ALL 
SWEET LITTLE PRESENTS FOR A CHILD YES 
YOU'D BE WRONG LET'S HAVE A BIT OF FUN 
FIRST OF ALL I'M GONNA RIP THIS FELLOW'S HEAD OFF LIKE THAT

THAT LITTLE GLASS LINER WOULD HAVE BEEN FILLED PROBABLY WITH PERFUME 
AND THESE THINGS WOULD HAVE SAT ON A SMART GIRL'S DRESSING TABLE 
AND SHE'D HAVE PUT A BIT OF EAU DE COLOGNE ABOUT HER PERSON 
HAVING RETRIEVED IT FROM WITHIN THE TEDDY BEAR SWEET AREN'T THEY 
ESTIMATE ONE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY
