AAAARGH 
NOW DIE 
THE PETRELLI BROTHERS HAVE DISAPPEARED INTO A BALL OF FIRE 
HIRO HAS PERFORMED A VANISHING ACT 
AND SYLAR'S PLANS FOR WORLD DOMINATION HAVE GONE DOWN THE DRAIN 
WITH ONE WEEK TO GO BEFORE THE EAGERLY ANTICIPATED SECOND SERIES STARTS 
HOW DID THE HEROES END UP IN SUCH A DESPERATE STATE 
IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN HEROES BEFORE HOLD ON YOU'RE GOING FOR A BIG TIME RIDE 
THE HEROES ARE BACK 
WITH SOME OLD FACES AND PLENTY OF NEW ONES 
THIS TIME IT'S NOT JUST NEW YORK CITY UNDER THREAT 
IT'S THE WHOLE WORLD 
IT'S A CONTINUATION OF THIS AMAZING STORY AND AMAZING JOURNEY WE'VE ALL HAD 
IT'S GONNA TAKE IT TO A WHOLE NOTHER LEVEL THIS YEAR 
IT'S PRETTY EXCITING 
THE HEROES HAVE BEEN TORN APART SINCE THE SHOWDOWN WITH SYLAR 
THE BENNETS HAVE GONE INTO HIDING 
HIRO HAS FOUND HIMSELF BACK IN JAPANESE HISTORY 
AND THE FATE OF PETER AND NATHAN PETRELLI IS UNKNOWN 
BUT JUST HOW DO THE LIVES OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY GROUP 
END IN SUCH TRAGEDY 
WHO ARE THE HEROES 
AND WHO ARE THE ANTI HEROES 
SHOW ME 
THE JOURNEY BEGAN WHEN ONE MAN WAS TOLD BY SAVING THE CHEERLEADER 
HE COULD SAVE THE WORLD 
PETER PETRELLI WAS A HOSPICE NURSE WHO ONE DAY DISCOVERED HE HAD SUPER POWERS 
WELL ALMOST 
PETER IS A BIT OF A LOST SOUL 
STALLED IN LIFE WASN'T SURE WHERE HE WAS GOING 
OR WHAT HE WAS GOING TO BE DOING OR WHO HE WAS GOING TO BE DOING IT WITH 
HE COMES TO FIND OUT THAT HE HAS THIS GIFT AND CURSE IN A WAY 
PETER HAS THE ABILITY TO ABSORB THE POWERS OF ANYONE HE COMES INTO CONTACT WITH 
INCLUDING MATT PARKMAN THE MIND READING COP 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME 
I GET THE ONE ABILITY THAT 
A POLICE OFFICER WOULD WANT THE ABILITY TO HEAR EVERYTHING 
DON'T HURT ME 
AND IT PUTS MY CHARACTER INTO SUCH AMAZING SITUATIONS 
THAT HE ONLY DREAMT ABOUT BEING IN BUT HE MAY NOT BE PREPARED FOR 
ME AGAIN 
I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY 
I'M NOT ABOUT TO PAY NOBODY'S WAY 
COS IT'S ALL ABOUT THE DARK IN ME 
NIKI IS A CARING MOTHER 
WHO HAS AN ALTER EGO CALLED JESSICA WITH SUPERHUMAN STRENGTH 
AND WOE BETIDE ANYONE WHO COMES BETWEEN HER AND HER SON 
FREAK IN THE MORNIN' FREAK IN THE EVENIN' 
JUST LIKE ME 
IF YOU THREATEN OUR SON AGAIN 
I'M GOING TO PUT MY HEEL THROUGH YOUR SKULL 
SHE'S ALWAYS GRAPPLING WITH HER EMOTIONS 
WITH WHETHER SHE'S GONNA BE ABLE TO STAY IN CONTROL 
OF THESE DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES THAT LIVE INSIDE HER 
YOU LEFT THAT FOR HIM 
CUTE 
ALWAYS HER GOAL AS A MOTHER IS TO BE ABLE TO GIVE A SAFE LIFE 
AND A BETTER LIFE FOR HER CHILD 
SO THAT'S ALWAYS THE ULTIMATE GOAL FOR HER 
AND SOMETIMES IT JUST GETS A LITTLE MESSY 
MEANWHILE ONE HERO LOVED EVERY SECOND OF HIS POWER 
STOP BEING SO HARD ON YOURSELF 
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH 
I KNOW THAT YOU CAN CHANGE 
SO CLEAR YOUR HEAD AND COME ROUND 
COME ON SEE THE LIGHT ON YOUR FACE 
LET IT SHINE JUST LET IT SHINE 
LET IT SHINE 
HIRO NAKAMURA IS A BIG COMIC BOOK ENTHUSIAST 
AND ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT HE WAS MEANT FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL 
AND HE KEPT ON TRYING HARD AND HARD TO KIND OF REVERSE TIME 
AND FINDS 
HE ACTUALLY CAN 
IT'S ONLY WHEN I LOSE MYSELF WITH SOMEONE ELSE 
THAT I FIND MYSELF 
I FIND MYSELF 
WHILE SOME HEROES EMBRACED THEIR NEW POWERS 
OTHERS WERE IN DENIAL 
AND NATHAN PETRELLI DIDN'T SHARE HIS BROTHER'S ENTHUSIASM 
FOR THEIR NEW FOUND ABILITIES I THINK I CAN FLY 
THESE ALL UNDECIDEDS 
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN FLY WHY DON'T YOU JUMP OFF THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE 
NATHAN PETRELLI IS THE ULTIMATE MACHIAVELLIAN PERSON 
HE HAS ONE THING ON HIS MIND AND THAT IS HIS POLITICAL CAREER 
AND TO HELL WITH ANYTHING THAT GETS IN HIS WAY 
THANKS FOR YOUR VOTE 
I'M BECOMING THIS 
ALL I WANT TO DO 
IS BE MORE LIKE ME AND BE LESS LIKE YOU 
NATHAN VIEWS PETER AS A HUGE THREAT 
TO HIS PUBLIC PERSONA TO HIS CAREER 
TO HIS WANTING TO BE ELECTED TO CONGRESS 
BECAUSE WHO WANTS A CRAZY BROTHER WHO SAYS HE CAN FLY 
BUT THERE WAS ONE PERSON WHO CAME TO REALISE PETER WASN'T CRAZY 
YOU CHANDRA SURESH 
NO THAT WAS MY FATHER 
YEAH UM 
I THINK I MAY BE ONE OF THEM 
AND WHILE PETER SEARCHED FOR ANSWERS 
MOHINDER TRIED TO MAKE SENSE OF HIS MURDERED FATHER'S RESEARCH 
TROUBLE 
TROUBLE TROUBLE TROUBLE TROUBLE 
NOW I CAN FULFIL MY DUTY AS A SON 
HE SO WANTS TO BELIEVE THAT WHAT HIS FATHER WAS DOING WAS RIGHT 
EVERYBODY THOUGHT THAT SURESH'S FATHER WAS COMPLETELY INSANE 
AS YOU WOULD IF SOMEBODY COMES UP TO YOU AND SAYS 
I THINK PEOPLE ARE DEVELOPING ABILITIES WHERE THEY CAN FLY 
JUMP OFF A BUILDING AND SPLAT ALL OVER THE PAVEMENT 
AND THEN JUST REGENERATE 
YOU WOULD THINK THEY WERE CRAZY 
I GET KNOCKED DOWN BUT I GET UP AGAIN 
YOU'RE NOT EVER GONNA KEEP ME DOWN 
I GET KNOCKED DOWN BUT I GET UP AGAIN 
YOU'RE NOT EVER GONNA KEEP ME DOWN 
I GET KNOCKED DOWN BUT I GET UP AGAIN 
YOU'RE NOT EVER GONNA KEEP ME DOWN 
CLAIRE BENNET IS INDESTRUCTIBLE 
SHE HAS SELF HEALING ABILITIES WHICH SHE PUSHES TO THE LIMIT 
SHE'S ON THE QUEST TO FIGURE OUT 
EXACTLY HOW HER ABILITY WORKS 
AND WHAT HER LIMITS ARE AND WHAT SHE CAN DO AND WHAT SHE CAN'T DO 
I REALLY LOVE THE IDEA OF TEENAGE 
YOU KNOW THAT SENSE OF FEELING THAT YOU'RE INDESTRUCTIBLE 
AND THAT FEELING THAT MOST TEENAGERS FEEL 
THAT THEIR PARENTS AREN'T EXACTLY WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE 
THE WORLD FEELS LIKE AT THAT AGE 
THAT SOMEHOW THE WORLD IS LYING TO YOU 
THE BEAUTY ABOUT CLAIRE'S CHARACTER IS THAT ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE 
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO GROW UP 
TRUST ME 
I ACTUALLY KNOW A FEW THINGS 
THERE'S A MAN WHO LEADS A LIFE OF DANGER 
TO EVERYONE HE MEETS HE STAYS A STRANGER HELLO 
EVERY MOVE HE MAKES ANOTHER CHANCE HE TAKES 
ODDS ARE HE WON'T LIVE TO SEE TOMORROW 
SECRET AGENT MAN 
MR. BENNET WORKED FOR A SECRET ORGANISATION KNOWN AS THE COMPANY 
WHICH ABDUCTED AND EXPERIMENTED ON PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL ABILITIES 
WHEN CLAIRE WAS TARGETED HE SOON SWITCHED SIDES 
HE HAS TO REALLY TAKE A STAND 
BETWEEN THE WORK THAT HE'S BEEN DOING 
IN FOLLOWING BAGGING TAGGING 
CHRONICLING STUDYING THESE PEOPLE 
AND PROTECTING HIS ADOPTED DAUGHTER WHO TURNS OUT TO BE ONE OF THEM 
GO DEEP 
TAKE ANYTHING THAT WOULD LEAD THEM TO HER 
BUT THE MAIN PERSON CLAIRE NEEDED PROTECTION FROM 
WAS SYLAR 
MY NAME IS SYLAR 
RUN AWAY RUN AWAY 
RUN CHILDREN RUN FOR YOUR LIFE 
RUN AWAY RUN AWAY 
RUN CHILDREN AAH 
ALL YOU LITTLE CHILDREN 
RUN THIS WAY 
I HAVE GOT A BEAST AT BAY 
SYLAR IS THE MOST FEARED THE MOST EVIL THE MOST HATED 
HE GETS SO POWER HUNGRY WITH IT THAT HE JUST WANTS MORE AND MORE AND MORE 
BOOM 
PETER AND SYLAR ARE IN SOME WAYS TWO HALVES OF THE SAME COIN 
PETER PETRELLI 
BOTH DRIVEN BY SIMILAR FEELINGS 
BUT BOTH OF THEIR AVENUES LAY BEFORE THEM BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE 
AND WHAT THEIR LIVES HAVE LED THEM TO BE 
SYLAR 
I REMEMBER YOU 
YOU'RE LIKE ME AREN'T YOU 
I'D LIKE TO SEE HOW THAT WORKS 
ARGHHH 
PETER STARTS TO DISCOVER JUST WHO SYLAR IS 
AND ITS IMPACTFUL OF NOW WHAT HE HAS TO DO IS STOP THIS PERSON 
THIS THING THIS GREAT POWER 
THAT COULD REALLY DESTROY AND KILL A LOT OF THE WORLD 
HAVEN'T I KILLED YOU BEFORE DIDN'T TAKE 
WE WERE IN THE PLAZA 
THERE'S THE CONVERGENCE ME COMING TO BLOW MYSELF UP 
AND PETER SORT OF DOING WHATEVER HE CAN TO STOP IT 
BUT THERE'S THE CATCH WHICH IS I KNOW THAT IF HE GETS ANGRY ENOUGH 
HE'LL ABSORB MY POWER AND GO NUCLEAR 
BUT IN THE NICK OF TIME 
PETER'S AMBITIOUS BROTHER CAME THROUGH 
NATHAN IN THE END HE'S FACED WITH THIS DECISION 
AND HE DOES THE RIGHT THING 
I'M NOT LEAVING YOU PETER 
I CAN'T LET YOU DIE 
YOU SAVED THE CHEERLEADER 
SO WE COULD SAVE THE WORLD 
YOU READY 
WITH THE PETRELLI BROTHERS' EXPLOSIVE END 
WHAT IS THE FUTURE FOR THEM AND THE REST OF THE HEROES 
ALL WE KNOW IS THAT PETER GOT SCOOPED UP BY HIS BROTHER 
THEY FLEW OFF AND SECONDS LATER THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION 
SO I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO THE GUY 
WE LEAVE THE BENNETS ON KIRBY PLAZA AND THEY KIND OF LIMP OFF INTO THE SUNSET BATTERED BUT INTACT 
SEASON TWO PICKS UP AT A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE WE'RE FOUR MONTHS DOWN THE LINE 
HE WAS THE HUNTER THEY'RE NOW THE HUNTED 
TRUST ME THE COMPANY IS STILL OUT THERE AND THEY WILL FIND US UNLESS WE'RE FLAWLESS WITH OUR PLAN 
PARKMAN IN SEASON TWO HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A DETECTIVE 
HE DOES ABUSE HIS POWERS 
DUDE IT'S HER SHOOT HER 
YOU'LL SEE A MARKED CHANGE IN NATHAN PETRELLI 
FROM THE AGGRESSIVE ALPHA MALE TO SOMEONE WHO'S BECOME A BIT MORE INTROSPECTIVE 
FOR SEASON TWO WE START WITH PROFESSOR SURESH TWENTY 
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU AND WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME 
HE'S HARDENED MORE STREETWISE YOU KNOW 
WE CATCH UP WITH HIRO IN FEUDAL JAPAN 
HE KINDA GETS TO MEET HIS IDOL 
AND THEN HE REALISES HE'S NOT QUITE WHAT HE THOUGHT HE WAS 
NIKI FEELS THAT THE SAFEST PLACE FOR HER SON TO BE IS NOT WITH HER 
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I'LL BE GONE 
BUT I DO KNOW THAT WHEN I COME BACK WE'LL BE TOGETHER 
WHILE SHE'S TRYING TO GET IN CONTROL AND UNDERSTAND THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO HER 
MY CHARACTER IS UP AGAINST SOME ODDS THAT I DON'T THINK HE ANTICIPATED 
WHO ARE YOU 
FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE IN SOME WAYS 
THERE ARE SO MANY VILLAINS OUT THERE THAT WE HAVEN'T EVEN TOUCHED ON YET 
AND I THINK HEROES IS GONNA GET EVEN MORE EXCITING IN SEASON TWO
