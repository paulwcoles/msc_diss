JOKING ASIDE IT'S VERY VERY GOOD FOR YOU AS JOHN QUITE RIGHTLY SAID 
HOW MANY TIMES A MONTH WOULD YOU EAT IT 
I'VE ONLY EVER EATEN IT TWICE IN MY LIFE 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE MEATS WHERE YOU REALLY HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO COOK IT BECAUSE IT'S SO DEVOID OF FAT 
YOU CAN OVERCOOK IT VERY QUICKLY IN WHICH CASE IT CAN BE HORRIBLE 
IS THAT WHY SOUTH AFRICANS WERE SERVING IT WITH FRUITY SAUCES 
YES THEY DO AND CREAM SAUCES 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OSTRICH WE WERE SAYING DOWN IN SOUTH AFRICA THEY SERVE IT WITH FRUITY SAUCES 
YEAH THEY DO IT WITH I DID HAVE IT WITH MANGO AND THERE WAS ORANGE 
THE SAUCE ITSELF YOU THINK IT WOULD BE WHAT I CALL A BITING SAUCE BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY REALLY REALLY SWEET 
I'D NEVER THINK OF PUTTING A SWEET THING WITH A MEAT I KNOW IT'S TRUE 
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT I THINK WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED THAT A FEW TIMES ON HERE 
PHIL YOU'RE COOKING IT DOWN WITH ONIONS GARLIC AND WHAT

THAT'S A NICE IDEA 
VERY GOOD FOURTEEN MINUTES TO GO TIME IS MOVING ON 
ARE YOU QUITE A GOOD COOK AT HOME ARE YOU THE MAIN MAN 
I'M THE COOK YEAH 
MY PARTNER SCOTT EVERY SO OFTEN HE'LL COOK BUT HE JUST KNOWS HOW TO DO SPAGHETTI BOLOGNAISE

FEEL LIKE COOKING AND HE'LL SAY HE'LL DO THAT AND I DON'T SAY IT VERY OFTEN BUT I DO APPRECIATE IT 
VERY VERY MUCH BECAUSE THE EFFORT IS PUT INTO IT 
THE LOVE HAS BEEN PUT INTO IT WHERE IS HOME SOMETIMES YOU SPEND TIME IN AMERICA 
HOME FOR ME IS THE U. K. I'M A BRITISH SUBJECT 
ALTHOUGH I HAVE TWO PASSPORTS 
BUT I WAS BORN IN BRITAIN AND ACTUALLY BORN IN GLASGOW 
BUT MY FAMILY'S IN AMERICA MY MOM AND DAD MY BROTHER AND SISTER 
BUT WE HAVE A HOME IN CHELSEA IN LONDON AND WE ALSO HAVE A PLACE IN CARDIFF 
I KIND OF SPEND MY TIME BETWEEN BOTH ALTERNATE BETWEEN THE TWO 
IT'S QUITE INTERESTING YOU WERE EIGHT WHEN YOU WENT TO AMERICA THAT'S CORRECT 
WAS LEAVING SCOTLAND AT THAT STAGE A SHOCK FOR YOU 
OR WAS IT QUITE EXCITING 
FOR MY BROTHER AND SISTER IT WAS A SHOCK THEY WERE IN THEIR TEENS 
MY SISTER WAS GOING TO GLASGOW UNIVERSITY MY BROTHER WAS GOING TO BE ON RANGERS' JUNIOR TEAM 
FOR ME WHEN YOU'RE THAT AGE YOU GO WHERE YOUR PARENTS TAKE YOU YOU HAVE TO TRUST IN THAT 
I LOOKED AT IT AS A BIG ADVENTURE 
IT WAS IT COMPLETELY CHANGED MY LIFE IT CHANGED WHO I WAS 
AND GAVE ME THIS KIND OF I CALL IT THE AMERICAN DRIVE REALLY 
YOU KNOW I THINK I HAVE THE BEST OF THE BRITISH LIFE IN ME AND I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF THE BEST OF AMERICA 
IS THAT WHERE THE THEATRE BUG CAME FROM JUST BEING OUT THERE BEING DIFFERENT 
WITH THE SCOTTISH ACCENT YOU STAND OUT FROM THE REST THEY EMBRACE THAT THE AMERICANS 
ACTUALLY THEY MADE FUN OF ME SO I LEARNED TO SPEAK 
AW 
I KNOW TERRIBLE ISN'T IT WATCH YOUR FINGER PHIL GETTING WORRIED ABOUT THAT 
THEY MADE FUN OF THE SCOTTISH ACCENT SO I AS A DEFENCE MECHANISM LEARNED HOW TO SPEAK WITH AN AMERICAN ACCENT 
THE IRONIC THING IS SINCE I'VE DONE THAT I GUESS IT'S JUST 
SOMETHING I SHOULD PROBABLY GO TO A PSYCHOLOGIST AND FIGURE IT OUT 
BUT ER I ALWAYS SPEAK AMERICAN BECAUSE I FEEL THAT I ONLY SPEAK SCOTTISH WITH OTHER SCOTTISH PEOPLE 
IT GETS YOU GOING I'VE BEEN UP TO SEE NICK IN SCOTLAND

SUGAR FLOUR 
O. K. SO A NICE CRUMBLE MIX TO GO ON TOP OF THE EGGS 
THERE YOU GO BOILED EGGS IN THERE 
LOVELY 
WHAT DO I NEED HERE 
I NEED ONE OF THESE ON THE GO 
BOYS WOULD YOU EVER CONSIDER HAVING A FARM AND GROWING YOUR OWN PRODUCE 
YOU DO A BIT OF THAT AS LONG AS I HAD A FARMER EXACTLY 
NICK WOULD BE A GENTLEMAN FARMER 
YES YOU KNOW I QUITE ENJOY THAT SORT OF LIFE 
IT'S HARD WORK THOUGH VERY VERY HARD WORK 
IT'S A BIT LIKE PEOPLE SAYING I HAVE MADE LOTS OF MONEY I'M GOING TO BUY A RESTAURANT DON'T DO IT 
DON'T DO IT IT'S VERY TOUGH 
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A SMALL FORTUNE START WITH A LARGE FORTUNE AND THEN OPEN A RESTAURANT 
THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES YOU SOUND LIKE JOHN BARROWMAN 
I KNOW I'VE BEEN AROUND HIM TOO LONG 
I DIDN'T KNOW JOHN WAS SCOTTISH 
HE'S MORE SCOTTISH THAN I AM 
EXACTLY 
LISTEN WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT I HAVE NO IDEA DUCK EGGS 
I'D LOVE TO TALK ABOUT DUCK EGGS TO YOU GUYS 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FRIGHTENED OF USING THEM BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY'RE NOT LIKE NORMAL EGGS 
BUT THEY'RE PERFECTLY O. K. FOR YOU THEY'RE EVEN CREAMIER THAN HENS' EGGS 
THE YOLK IS MUCH MUCH NICER 
YOU KNOW WHO IS BRILLIANT AT MAKING CRUMBLE MRS. NAIRN IS SHE 
DO YOU WANT TO GIVE HER A RING 
I THINK I DO ACTUALLY COS IT'S HARD WORK EXACTLY 
THE SECRET IS TO HAVE THE BUTTER WARMER THAN FRIDGE TEMPERATURE 
THEN IT CRUMBLES UP QUICKER DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE OTHER SECRET IS NOT TO PUT THE SUGAR IN AT THE START 
NOW YOU TELL ME DON'T PUT THE SUGAR IN AT THE START 
THE REASON FOR THAT IS IT CREAMS TOGETHER AND BECOMES LIKE A CAKE MIX 
NOW YOU TELL ME BOYS BRIEFLY GOING BACK TO DUCK EGGS 
WOULD YOU TREAT THEM DIFFERENTLY TO HEN EGGS 
NICHOLAS GO ON THEY ARE RICHER SO YOU USE LESS THE YOLK IS BRIGHT ORANGE ISN'T IT 
YEAH BUT PRETTY MUCH USE THEM AS HENS' EGGS BETTER FLAVOUR I ALWAYS THINK 
THERE'S MORE CHANCE THEY'LL BE LESS INTENSIVELY REARED 
DUCKS TEND TO BE MORE EXTENSIVELY REARED THAN CHICKENS CAN YOU CHOP ME SOME OF THOSE 
FARMERS' MARKETS ARE GREAT PLACES TO GET THEM IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FARM IN THE CITY 
WE'LL GET THERE IN THE END 
DON'T WORRY WE WILL GET THERE IN THE END 
BEAUTIFUL GARLIC CHIVES I'LL PUT THOSE INTO MY SALAD WHAT ARE YOU DOING THE APPLE NEEDS TO BE COOKED 
WE'VE GOT TEN MINUTES 
TIME'S MOVING ON THREE MINUTES HAVE GONE ALREADY MY CRUMBLE MIX IS READY 
I HAVE A GREAT THING HERE FOR YOU LOOK AT THIS 
BUTTER IN THE PAN I LOVE USING MICROWAVE RICE IT'S MY WIFE'S IDEA I HAVE TO ADD 
IT'S WHAT YOU DID WHEN YOU INVITED ME BACK TO YOUR PLACE I DID YES 
I WAS EXPECTING SOME FABULOUS FEAST BUT I GOT MICROWAVED RICE 
SO FOAMING BUTTER 
EGGS STRAIGHT IN BREAK THEM UP JUST COOK THEM IN THE PAN UNTIL THEY GO REALLY DRY 
I WANTED ONE EGG FOR A POACHED EGG TAKE IT OUT OF THERE MATE 
IT'S ALREADY POACHED 
ISN'T IT 
SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS 
GET THE PANEER IN THERE AS WELL 
JUST COOK THAT EGG UNTIL IT BECOMES VERY VERY DRY 
YOU ALMOST OVERCOOK IT IT GOES AGAINST ALL THE COOKING RULES ABOUT MAKING SCRAMBLED EGG 
YOU ARE DOING EGG FRIED RICE YES YOU WANT SHREDS OF EGG 
THE RICE GOES STRAIGHT IN THERE AFTER THAT DO YOU WANT YOUR ONIONS THERE YES PLEASE 
A FEW ONIONS AND TOMATOES SLIGHTLY UNDERCOOKED THERE BEAUTIFUL 
IT ALL CAME TOGETHER BEAUTIFULLY 
A BIT OF PANEER IN THERE TO GIVE IT A KICK FRESH CORIANDER 
YOU CAN SEE WE'RE USING LOTS OF LOVELY FRESH PRODUCE FROM THE SPITALFIELDS CITY FARM

LEMON DRESSING WITH THAT PHIL YES WEPUT IN THERE OH SOME CHEESE 
I HAVE PUT SOME TARRAGON INTO THE STIR FRY AS WELL I QUITE LIKE PANEER 
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG CHEF WE HAD SOME INDIAN 
A LONG TIME AGO THANK YOU NICK WHAT AGE ARE YOU PHIL 
TWENTY NINE YEAH RIGHT 
WE HAD SOME INDIANS TAKE OVER THE HOTEL FOR A WHOLE MONTH 
THEY WERE VEGETARIANS AND THEY COOKED THIS BEAUTIFUL INDIAN FOOD 
THEY WERE INDIAN COOKS THAT COOKED FOR THE COOKS IT WAS FANTASTIC 
DID YOU SEASON THIS 
NO I HAVEN'T I'VE GOT A LOVELY SALAD THERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
I WILL DO ANOTHER TOMATO WE HAVE A QUICKIE QUESTION 
LISTEN UP BOYS 
TODAY IT COMES FROM CLAIRE DALY FROM STOURBRIDGE 
IT'S CLAIRE DIGBY HELLO ENJOYING THE PROGRAMME 
IT'S FANTASTIC WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO ASK OUR CHEFS 
I'D LIKE TO ASK HOW IS THE BEST WAY TO MAKE A CHOCOLATE SAUCE TO COAT A STEAMED SPONGE PUDDING 
SO THAT WHEN YOU TURN IT OUT 
IT FALLS DOWN THE SIDE OF THE SPONGE PUDDING 
AS OPPOSED TO A BIG BLOB ON TOP EXACTLY 
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS IT BECOMES COAGULATED 
CLASSIC CHOCOLATE SAUCE TENDS TO BE CHOCOLATE AND MILK AND BUTTER 
OR THERE'S THE AINSLEY HARRIOTT CHOCOLATE SAUCE WHICH IS BUTTER HONEY AND COCOA POWDER 
IT STICKS TOGETHER LOVELY IT'S PERFECT FOR COATING A SPONGE 
HE SHOWED ME IT YEARS AGO AND I'VE USED IT SINCE A BRILLIANT RECIPE YEAH JUST COCOA POWDER 
SO OFTEN YOU DON'T HAVE A BLOCK OF CHOCOLATE DO YOU 
NO JUST COCOA POWDER A BIT OF HONEY IN THERE AND SOME WATER 
AND IT BOILS DOWN AND NATURALLY THICKENS 
THE SWEETNESS COMES FROM THE HONEY YOU CAN JUST POUR THAT ON THE TOP 
OR ANOTHER VERSION WHAT ABOUT MELTING CHOCOLATE FOR CHOCOLATE SAUCE 
I USE MY OLD METHOD WHICH IS A BIT OF COCOA POWDER BUTTER AND SUGAR 
I THINK IT'S A PINT OF WATER SIX OUNCES OF CASTER SUGAR 
AND SIX OUNCES OF COCOA POWDER AND A TOUCH OLIVE OIL WHISK IT UP 
AND IT WILL THICKEN NATURALLY 
POUR THAT IN THE BOTTOM OF THE SPONGE PUDDING COOK IT AND IT WILL TURN OUT PERFECTLY 
SOMETHING'S BURNING I CAN SMELL IT YOU SEE 
BECAUSE IT HAS NO FAT IT DOESN'T SPLIT 
THERE YOU GO IF THE FAT SEPARATES FROM YOUR NORMAL MELTED CHOCOLATE 
MELT IT DOWN IN THE MICROWAVE A TOUCH OF CREAM AND BUTTER TO GET THAT GLAZE 
IF IT TURNS POP IT IN THE MICROWAVE FOR ANOTHER THIRTY SECONDS 
OR OVER A BOWL OF HOT WATER AND JUST STIR IT ROUND 
SO GOOD LUCK TO YOU THANK YOU A COUPLE OF TIPS FOR YOU GIVE HER A ROUND OF APPLAUSE 
THREE MINUTES TO GO
