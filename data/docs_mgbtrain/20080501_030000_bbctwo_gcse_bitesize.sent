HELLO 
THIS PROGRAMME ON WORLD RELIGIONS WILL LOOK AT THE KEY GCSE TOPICS 
OF WORLD RELIGIONS ULTIMATE QUESTIONS MORAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES 
THE OTHER PROGRAMME ON RELIGIOUS STUDIES IS A NEW PROGRAMME 
ON PHILOSOPHY AND ETHICS 
THE BEST WAY TO STUDY WITH BITESIZE IS TO TACKLE ONE TOPIC AT A TIME 
WORKING THROUGH THE VIDEO IN BITESIZE CHUNKS 
WE'VE DIVIDED THE PROGRAMME INTO THREE MAIN SECTIONS 
IT'S UNDER THESE BROAD HEADINGS THAT YOU'LL BE MARKED IN THE EXAM 
LET'S START WITH UNDERSTANDING 
FOR THE EXAM YOU NEED TO SHOW YOU UNDERSTAND 
IF YOU DON'T YOU WON'T BE ABLE ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY PEOPLE DO CERTAIN THINGS 
OR HAVE THE OPINIONS THEY DO 
WITH A BUILDING EVERYTHING ABOVE GROUND RESTS ON THE FOUNDATIONS 
OUR FOUNDATION IS A KNOWLEDGE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS 
WE CAN'T EXPLAIN THE EFFECTS OF A RELIGION ON ITS FOLLOWERS 
OR EVALUATE ITS BELIEFS 
UNTIL WE'VE GOT SOME BASIC FACTS AT OUR FINGERTIPS 
FIRST WE LOOK AT CHRISTIANITY 
LET'S ASK A SIMPLE QUESTION 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN CHRISTIANS COME TOGETHER FOR AN ACT OF WORSHIP 
ACTS OF WORSHIP ARE SO CENTRAL TO A CHRISTIAN FAITH AND OTHER RELIGIONS 
THAT ANSWERING THIS QUESTION GIVES YOU FACTS ABOUT CHRISTIAN BELIEFS 
WATCH THIS CLIP MAKE NOTES ABOUT WHAT YOU SEE AND WHAT IT TELLS YOU ABOUT CHRISTIAN BELIEFS 
LIVING GOD 
WHOSE SON DIED ON THE CROSS FOR EVERYONE WHO LIVES 
SHOWED US BY HIS DYING HOW THE PLACE OF DEFEAT CAN BE THE PLACE OF VICTORY 
HELP US TO TAKE UP OUR OWN CROSS 
WHATEVER FORM IT TAKES 
SO THAT WOMEN AND MEN MAY RECOGNISE YOUR LOVE IN US 
AND COME TO YOU WITH CHRIST 
RISEN GOD EASTER GOD 
COME AND MAKE US YOUR LIVING CHURCH 
THESE YOUR GIFTS OF BREAD AND WINE 
MAY BE TO US THE BODY AND BLOOD OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST 
WHO IN THE SAME NIGHT THAT HE WAS BETRAYED TOOK BREAD AND GAVE YOU THANKS 
DRAW NEAR WITH FAITH RECEIVE THE BODY OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST 
WHICH HE GAVE FOR YOU AND HIS BLOOD WHICH HE SHED FOR YOU 
FEED ON HIM IN YOUR HEARTS BY FAITH WITH THANKSGIVING 
MAY THE BODY OF CHRIST KEEP YOU IN ETERNAL LIFE 
MAY THE BODY OF CHRIST KEEP YOU IN ETERNAL LIFE 
BLESSED IS OUR BROTHER JESUS WHO ON THE NIGHT THAT HE WAS BETRAYED 
TOOK BREAD GAVE THANKS BROKE IT AND SAID 
THIS IS MY BODY 
IT IS FOR YOU DO THIS IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME 
IN THE SAME WAY HE TOOK THE CUP AFTER SUPPER AND SAID 
THIS CUP IS THE NEW COVENANT IN MY BLOOD 
IT IS GIVEN FOR YOU 
DO THIS WHENEVER YOU DRINK IT 
IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME 
AT THE LAST SUPPER 
JESUS TOOK BREAD AND GAVE YOU THANKS 
HE BROKE THE BREAD 
GAVE IT TO HIS DISCIPLES AND SAID 
TAKE THIS 
ALL OF YOU AND EAT IT 
WHEN SUPPER WAS ENDED HE TOOK THE CUP 
AGAIN HE GAVE YOU THANKS AND PRAISE 
GAVE THE CUP TO HIS DISCIPLES AND SAID 
TAKE THIS ALL OF YOU AND DRINK FROM IT 
NOW LET US HEAR THE WORD OF GOD 
JESUS SAID 
I HAVE COME IN ORDER THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE LIFE 
LIFE IN ALL ITS FULLNESS 
HE'S THE LORD HE'S THE LORD 
HE'S THE KING HE'S THE KING 
HE'S ALIVE HE'S ALIVE 
THAT'S WHY WE SING THAT'S WHY WE SING 
LORD OF LORDS KING OF KINGS 
JESUS THAT YOU SENT YOUR HOLY SPIRIT YOU CHANGED US 
YOU'VE GIVEN US EVERYTHING WE COULD LONG FOR 
HOLY SPIRIT HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE TO YOU TODAY HOW WE LOVE YOU 
HOW WE LOVE YOU FATHER 
HOW WE LOVE YOU LORD JESUS 
HOW WE LOVE YOU HOLY SPIRIT AMEN 
O. K. HOW DID YOU GET ON 
AS WELL AS SIMILARITIES YOU HOPEFULLY NOTICED DIFFERENCES IN THE ACTS OF WORSHIP 
THE FIRST TWO ARE BOTH IN A CHURCH 
WITH A PRIEST AND A SEATED CONGREGATION 
IN ONE THE PRIEST IS A MAN AND IN THE OTHER A WOMAN 
THE SERVICE IN THE THIRD CLIP ISN'T IN A CHURCH BUT IN THE OPEN AIR 
THE LEADER IS IN ORDINARY CLOTHES 
DIFFERENT AGAIN IS THE ECSTATIC SINGING DANCING 
AND SPEAKING IN TONGUES WHICH YOU SAW IN THE LAST CLIP 
IF YOU'RE SHARP EYED 
YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED DIFFERENT WAYS OF ARRANGING THE CHURCH 
IN THE ANGLICAN AND CATHOLIC SERVICE THE FOCAL POINT IS THE ALTAR 
WHILE IN THE BAPTIST SERVICE IT'S THE PULPIT WHERE THE MINISTER STANDS TO PREACH 
THESE DIFFERENCES SHOW HOW CAREFUL WE NEED TO BE 
YOU CAN WORSHIP IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND HAVE THE SAME BASIC BELIEF 
TO RAM HOME THIS POINT ABOUT STEREOTYPING CONSIDER BUDDHISM 
MOST FOLLOWERS DON'T DO WHAT YOU THINK ALL RELIGIOUS PEOPLE DO 
BELIEVE IN AN UNCHANGING CREATOR GOD 
BUDDHISM WAS FOUNDED BY A MAN WHO CAME TO BE KNOWN AS THE BUDDHA 
HE WAS NEVER THOUGHT OF AS A GOD 
WE DON'T THINK OF HIM AS A GOD AND HE DIDN'T REALLY SUPPORT THE BELIEF IN A GOD 
SO WHEN WE COME INTO THE SHRINE ROOM AND BOW IN FRONT OF THE BUDDHA 
WE'RE NOT WORSHIPPING A GOD 
WE PAY OUR RESPECTS AND SHOW GRATITUDE TO OUR TEACHER AND SPIRITUAL IDEAL 
IF BUDDHISM REJECTS THE NOTION OF GOD 
OF A BELIEF IN GOD 
CAN IT BE CALLED A RELIGION 
IF RELIGION IS ABOUT BEING BETTER 
AND HAPPIER AND KINDER HUMAN BEINGS 
THEN YES BUDDHISM IS RELIGION 
BUT IF RELIGION DEPENDS UPON A BELIEF IN GOD 
THEN PERHAPS IT SHOULDN'T BE CALLED A RELIGION 
IN BUDDHISM WE'RE TAUGHT NOT TO DEPEND ON SOME FORCE OUTSIDE OURSELVES 
BUT RATHER TO LOOK WITHIN 
IT'S WITHIN OURSELVES THAT WE FIND THE ANSWERS 
AND THE COMPASSION AND FRIENDSHIP 
NOW SIKHISM 
WATCH THE CLIP AND PAUSE THE TAPE 
SIKHISM STARTED WITH GURU NANAK 
HE WAS THE FIRST OF OUR TEN GURUS 
HE WAS BORN IN A PLACE CALLED TALWANDI WHICH IS NOW IN PAKISTAN 
AT THAT TIME YOU WERE EITHER A MUSLIM OR A HINDU AND HE WAS BORN INTO A HINDU FAMILY 
AS HE GREW OLDER HE FELT THAT IT WAS TIME FOR A CHANGE 
HE DIDN'T AGREE WITH OR UNDERSTAND THE RITUALS THAT HINDUISM HAS 
HE FELT THAT YOU LIVE A TRUE LIFE 
A SIMPLE DAY TO DAY BASIS 
AND WORSHIP GOD IN THE WAY YOU WANT TO 
GRADUALLY HE GOT MORE PEOPLE TO FOLLOW HIM AND TO BELIEVE IN HIM 
A GURDWARA IS A PLACE OF WORSHIP 
THE WORD GURDWARA MEANS HOUSE OF GOD 
IN SIKHISM EVERYONE IS EQUAL 
ONE OF THE WAYS OF SHOWING THIS IS THAT EVERYONE SITS ON THE FLOOR INSIDE THE GURDWARA 
MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN 
GURU MEANS SPIRITUAL TEACHER AND SIKH MEANS LEARNER 
THERE ARE TEN GURUS IN ALL 
EACH GURU CONTRIBUTED HIS OWN WORDS AND TEACHINGS TO THE RELIGION 
THE TENTH GURU DECIDED THERE WOULD NO LONGER BE ANY HUMAN GURUS AS SUCH 
BUT THERE'D BE THE GURU GRANTH SAHIB ALL THE TEACHINGS OF THE TEN GURUS 
AND TEACHINGS FROM OTHER RELIGIONS THEY WERE MADE INTO A BOOK 
GURU GRANTH SAHIB THAT'S OUR GURU TODAY 
SIKH MEN AND WOMEN WEAR THE FIVE K.'S 
THIS IS BECAUSE EACH OF THE NAMES BEGIN WITH THE LETTER K. IN PUNJABI 
ALL THEY ARE SIMPLY IS FIVE THINGS THAT GURU GRANTH SAHIB GAVE TO SIKHS 
JUST TO MAKE THEM DISTINCTIVE 
THERE'S THE KACCHS THE BAGGY SHORTS THAT IS FREEDOM AND MOVEMENT 
THERE IS THE KESH LONG HAIR 
GURU GRANTH SAHIB SAID IT'S A NATURAL THING IT'S BEEN GIVEN TO YOU 
EVEN IF YOU DO CUT IT IT WILL GROW THAT LENGTH AGAIN SO WHY CUT IT 
AND THERE'S THE KARA THE BRACELET AND THAT REPRESENTS UNITY 
MANY PEOPLE THINK 
ONCE IT'S PUT ON YOU YOU CAN'T TAKE IT OFF WELL YOU CAN MY DAD DOESN'T WEAR IT ALL THE TIME 
THERE'S A KANGA WHICH IS A COMB 
THAT'S JUST TO KEEP YOUR HAIR NEAT AND TIDY ALL THE TIME 
THE LAST ONE IS THE KIRPAN THE DAGGER OR THE SWORD 
THAT'S NOT WORN IN THIS COUNTRY COS IT COULD BE SEEN AS A WEAPON 
YOU CAN WEAR A SYMBOLIC ONE AROUND YOUR NECK 
OR A SMALL ONE BAPTISED PEOPLE WEAR UNDERNEATH THEIR CLOTHES 
AMADEEP HAS ONE ENGRAVED INTO THE KANGA WHICH HE WEARS IN HIS HAIR 
WE REGARD COVERING OUR HEADS AS A SHOW OF RESPECT AND WE WOULD DO SO IN FRONT OF OUR ELDERS 
AND BECAUSE THE GURU GRANTH SAHIB IS REGARDED AS THE ELDEST WE WOULD ALWAYS COVER OUR HEAD 
IN THE PRESENCE OF THE GURU GRANTH SAHIB IN THE GURDWARA 
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE RELIGION IS THERE'S A LOT OF EQUALITY 
IN THIS DAY AND AGE WOMEN ARE FIGHTING FOR THEIR RIGHTS 
BUT IN SIKHISM IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE 
IN THE GURDWARA WOMEN READ FROM THE GURU GRANTH SAHIB AND SING THE HYMNS 
AND DO AS MUCH AS MEN DO 
HERE ARE POINTS YOU MIGHT'VE INCLUDED ON YOUR LIST 
THE BOOK IS NOW REGARDED AS A GURU 
HERE IS A TYPE OF QUESTION YOU MIGHT GET IN THE EXAM 
WATCH THE FOLLOWING CLIP ABOUT THE MOSQUE OR MUSLIM PLACE OF WORSHIP 
THEN PAUSE THE TAPE AND TRY ANSWERING THE QUESTION 
WHEREVER IN THE WORLD A MOSQUE IS IT WILL SHARE MANY SIMILAR FEATURES 
A MINARET FROM WHERE MUSLIMS ARE CALLED TO PRAYER 
SOME MOSQUES HAVE DOMES WHICH HELP IMPROVE THE ACOUSTICS INSIDE 
SOMETIMES ABOVE THE DOME OR THE MINARET 
THERE IS A STAR CRADLED IN A CRESCENT MOON 
BEFORE ENTERING A MOSQUE YOU REMOVE YOUR SHOES BECAUSE PEOPLE PRAY ON THE FLOOR 
BUT A MOSQUE IS MORE THAN A PLACE OF WORSHIP 
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE SOCIAL LIFE OF THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY 
FESTIVALS ARE CELEBRATED HERE WEDDINGS AND FUNERALS PERFORMED 
THE COURTYARD MAY BE SURROUNDED BY AN ARCADE 
WHICH PROVIDES PEACE FOR THOUGHT AND LEARNING 
SOME MOSQUES HAVE A MADRASAH OR SCHOOL 
WHERE PEOPLE CAN LEARN ARABIC THE QUR'AN AND ISLAMIC STUDIES 
MOSQUES CAN BE VERY PLAIN OR DECORATED WITH BEAUTIFUL PATTERNS 
BUT NEVER WITH PICTURES OF PEOPLE 
MUSLIMS BELIEVE THIS COULD DISTRACT PEOPLE FROM CONCENTRATING ON ALLAH'S GREATNESS 
THERE ARE FEW CHAIRS AND NO PEWS FOR PEOPLE TO SIT ON 
EVERYONE EXCEPT THE OLD AND INFIRM SITS ON THE FLOOR 
THE DIRECTION OF THE KA'BAH IS MARKED BY A NICHE IN THE KIBLAH WALL CALLED A MIHRAB 
IT IS NORMAL IN MOSQUES FOR MEN AND WOMEN TO PRAY IN SEPARATE AREAS 
HOW THIS IS ARRANGED DEPENDS ON THE DESIGN 
SOMETIMES THE WOMEN HAVE A BALCONY OR THEY MIGHT PRAY BEHIND A CURTAIN 
MUSLIMS DON'T HAVE TO PERFORM THEIR SALAH IN A MOSQUE EXCEPT ON FRIDAY AT MIDDAY 
THIS IS CALLED THE JUMU'AH PRAYER THERE ARE NO PRIESTS IN ISLAM 
WORSHIPPERS SPEAK DIRECTLY TO ALLAH BUT MOST MOSQUES HAVE AN IMAM 
MY DUTIES INCLUDE LEADING THE PEOPLE IN PRAYER 
DELIVER SERMONS GIVING SPEECHES 
ANSWERING QUESTIONS TEACHING CHILDREN 
CONDUCTING MARRIAGE CEREMONIES LEADING FUNERAL PRAYER 
THESE ARE THE NORMAL DUTIES OF AN IMAM 
SO HOW DID YOU DO WE'LL SHOW YOU THREE DIFFERENT POSSIBLE ANSWERS 
THEY'RE SHORT SUMMARIES YOU'D NEED TO WRITE MORE THAN THIS IN THE EXAM 
BUT THEY GIVE AN IDEA OF WHAT THE EXAMINERS WANT 
THIS ANSWER GIVES A FEW FACTS BUT SHOWS LITTLE UNDERSTANDING 
OF WHY THINGS ARE DONE AND USES FEW SPECIALIST RELIGIOUS WORDS 
IT'S ALSO TOO SWEEPING TO SUGGEST THAT EVERY MOSQUE HAS A MINARET 
AN ANSWER LIKE THIS COULD EXPECT AT MOST A GRADE E. 
NOW FOR ANSWER TWO 
THIS ANSWER IS MUCH BETTER 
IT CONTAINS MORE DETAIL AND CORRECT USE OF A NUMBER OF SPECIALIST WORDS 
AN ANSWER LIKE THIS WOULD BE IN GRADE C. TERRITORY 
IT'S ANSWER THREE THAT HITS THE BULL'S EYE 
THIS ANSWER CONTAINS LOTS OF DETAIL WITH EXPLANATIONS WHERE NEEDED 
AVOIDS SWEEPING STATEMENTS AND USES SOME RELEVANT SPECIALIST TERMS 
A CANDIDATE WHO WROTE ANSWERS LIKE THIS WOULD BE HEADING FOR A GRADE A 
THAT IS THE END OF THIS SECTION ON BASIC TEACHINGS 
NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO UNDERSTANDING RELIGIOUS WORDS 
STUDYING RELIGIOUS STUDIES INVOLVES COMING UP AGAINST UNFAMILIAR WORDS 
LET'S LOOK AT SOME MORE 
IN YOUR EXAM YOU NEED TO 
LET'S CHOOSE SOME WORDS SPECIFIC TO CHRISTIAN ACTS OF WORSHIP 
WORDS LIKE 
YOU PROBABLY HAVE AN IDEA AT LEAST OF WHAT EACH OF THESE WORDS MEANS 
PAUSE THE TAPE NOW AND WRITE DOWN A DEFINITION FOR EACH OF THEM 
THEN PLAY ON TO CHECK YOUR WORK 
HOW DID YOU GET ON IF YOU'VE FORGOTTEN WHAT THE WORDS MEAN 
THESE DEFINITIONS ARE HELPFUL 
COMING UP ARE TWO CLIPS SHOWING INFANT BAPTISM IN ANGLICAN CHURCHES 
ONE IN THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND ONE IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND 
CAN YOU GIVE THEM THEIR CORRECT NAME 
LISTEN TO THE PRIESTS DO THEY USE WORDS THAT HAVE A SPECIAL MEANING 
YOU MAY WANT TO VIEW THE CLIPS A COUPLE OF TIMES TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SEEN AND HEARD EVERYTHING 
LITTLE CHILD FOR YOU JESUS CHRIST CAME INTO THE WORLD 
FOR YOU HE LIVED AND SHOWED GOD'S LOVE 
FOR YOU HE TRIUMPHED OVER DEATH 
FOR YOU HE LIVES AND INTERCEDES 
ALL OF THIS FOR YOU 
COLIN HAMISH BROWN I BAPTISE YOU 
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND OF THE SON AND OF THE HOLY SPIRIT 
AND THE BLESSING OF GOD ALMIGHTY FATHER SON AND HOLY SPIRIT 
BE UPON YOU AND REMAIN WITH YOU ALWAYS 
ACCORDING TO CHRIST'S COMMANDMENT 
COLIN HAMISH BROWN STEADMAN IS NOW RECEIVED 
INTO THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE ONE HOLY AND APOSTOLIC CHURCH 
AND HE IS ENGAGED TO CONFESS THE FAITH OF CHRIST CRUCIFIED 
AND TO BE HIS FAITHFUL SERVANT ALL HIS DAYS 
THERE WE ARE 
MUM DAD AND GODPARENTS STAND BY THE FONT 
PARENTS AND GODPARENTS YOU HAVE BROUGHT THIS CHILD TO BAPTISM 
THE GODPARENTS ARE LIKE SPECIAL FRIENDS TO JAMIE 
THEY PROMISE TO HELP JAMIE GROW UP AS A CHRISTIAN 
YOU WILL HELP HIM TO GROW ANSWER FOR YOURSELVES AND FOR JAMIE 
DO YOU BELIEVE AND TRUST IN GOD THE FATHER WHO MADE THE WORLD 
I BELIEVE AND TRUST IN HIM 
DO YOU BELIEVE AND TRUST IN HIS SON JESUS CHRIST WHO REDEEMED MANKIND 
I BELIEVE AND TRUST IN HIM 
DO YOU BELIEVE AND TRUST IN HIS HOLY SPIRIT 
WHO GIVES LIFE TO THE PEOPLE OF GOD 
I BELIEVE AND TRUST IN HIM 
THIS IS THE FAITH OF THE CHURCH THIS IS OUR FAITH 
WE BELIEVE AND TRUST IN ONE GOD FATHER SON AND HOLY SPIRIT 
JAMIE MARK 
I BAPTISE YOU IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER 
AND OF THE SON 
AND OF THE HOLY SPIRIT 
AMEN 
THE VICAR CALLS JAMIE BY HIS FULL NAME JAMIE MARK SAUNDERS 
AND MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS ON HIS FOREHEAD 
AND I SIGN YOU WITH THE CROSS THE SIGN OF CHRIST 
DO NOT BE ASHAMED TO CONFESS THE FAITH OF CHRIST CRUCIFIED 
FIGHT VALIANTLY UNDER THE BANNER OF CHRIST 
AGAINST SIN THE WORLD AND THE DEVIL 
AND CONTINUE HIS FAITHFUL SOLDIER AND SERVANT TO THE END OF YOUR LIFE 
AMEN AMEN 
THIS CANDLE IS FOR JAMIE 
USUALLY ONE OF THE GROWN UPS WOULD LIGHT IT FROM THIS BIGGER CANDLE 
BUT THE VICAR SAID I COULD DO IT 
THE LIGHTED CANDLE SAYS WE HOPE JAMIE WILL SHINE LIKE A LIGHT LIKE JESUS 
SO HOW DID YOU DO SOME OF THE SPECIAL OBJECTS WERE 
WHAT ABOUT WHAT THE PRIEST SAID 
FOR YOU HE INTERCEDES JESUS PRAYS ON HUMANITY'S BEHALF 
I BAPTISE YOU IN BAPTISM THE BABY BECOMES PART OF THE COMMUNITY 
I SIGN YOU WITH THE CROSS SYMBOLISING CRUCIFIXION 
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER SON AND HOLY SPIRIT 
THIS EXPRESSES THE CHRISTIAN BELIEF IN THE THREEFOLD NATURE OF GOD 
IT SHOULD BE CLEAR NOW THAT UNLESS YOU KNOW THE MEANING OF WORDS 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SHOW YOUR UNDERSTANDING 
LEARN THOSE TERMS AND USE THEM THE EXAMINER ONLY MARKS WHAT YOU WRITE 
THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE PROGRAMME 
LOOK OUT FOR WORDS TO LEARN AND USE LET'S HAVE ANOTHER GO 
THE NEXT CLIP IS AN INTRODUCTION TO 
YOU CAN REWIND THE CLIP AND WATCH IT AGAIN 
WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE WORLD 
I'M THINKING ABOUT GOD BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS A MEETING WITH GOD 
I'M PART OF THE WORLD HE CREATED 
I WEAR MY KIPPAH TO SHOW I'M PROUD OF BEING A JEW 
THIS IS THE SYNAGOGUE THE JEWISH HOUSE OF WORSHIP 
ALL SYNAGOGUES TEND TO BE DIFFERENT THIS IS MODERN 
BUT THERE'S ONE THING THEY HAVE IN COMMON NO PICTURES OF GOD 
JEWISH LAW FORBIDS IMAGES OF GOD 
YOU WON'T SEE A MAN WITH A BEARD 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT GOD LOOKS LIKE BUT HE'S EVERYWHERE SEES EVERYTHING AND KNOWS EVERYTHING 
BEING JEWISH AFFECTS US FROM THE MOMENT WE'RE BORN TO WHEN WE DIE 
AND MAYBE BEYOND 
MOST JEWS ARE BORN JEWISH 
SO JEWS FEEL A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH OTHER 
JEWISH MALES ARE CIRCUMCISED GOD TOLD ABRAHAM TO DO THIS 
IT MARKS THE ENTRY INTO THE COVENANT WITH GOD 
IT'S AN IMPORTANT OCCASION WHICH LINKS THE BOY TO JEWS 
IN A CHAIN STRETCHING BACK TO ABRAHAM ISAAC AND JACOB 
THE LEADERS OF THE JEWS 
AT THIRTEEN A BOY IS THOUGHT READY TO TAKE ON ADULT RESPONSIBILITY 
TO MARK THIS HE HAS A BAR MITZVAH 
GIRLS AT TWELVE HAVE A BAT MITZVAH 
SHABBAT IS THE SEVENTH DAY WHEN WE'RE ORDERED BY GOD TO REST 
LIKE HE DID IT'S DIFFERENT FROM OTHER BUSY DAYS 
BY RESTING ON SHABBAT WE PROCLAIM OUR BELIEF IN GOD AS THE CREATOR 
THE LIGHTING OF CANDLES MARKS THE START OF SHABBAT 
IT'S THE WOMAN'S PRIVILEGE TO WELCOME IN SHABBAT 
SHEL SHABBAT 
JEWS LIVE ALL OVER THE WORLD I THINK ABOUT MY FRIENDS IN ISRAEL 
WHO WILL BE CELEBRATING SHABBAT WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN ON FRIDAY 
HOW DID YOU DO THE MAIN SPECIALIST TERMS USED WERE 
IT'S DONE FOR RELIGIOUS NOT HYGIENE REASONS 
IT BEGINS ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY 
THAT'S THE END OF THIS SECTION ON RELIGIOUS WORDS 
ONCE YOU'VE GOT A FOUNDATION OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT RELIGIOUS TERMS 
YOU MOVE ON TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLE'S BELIEFS 
LET'S LOOK AT UNDERSTANDING BELIEFS AND PRACTICES 
THE NEXT CLIP OUTLINES SOME BASIC TEACHINGS OF ISLAM 
MUSLIMS TALK ABOUT THEIR FAITH AND ITS IMPORTANCE TO THEM 
WHILE YOU WATCH IT 
ISLAM IS A COMPLETE WAY OF LIFE FROM BIRTH TO DEATH AND AFTER DEATH 
IT TEACHES MUSLIMS WHAT TO BELIEVE HOW TO BEHAVE TOWARDS OTHERS 
SO THEY CAN TRY TO REACH PEACE THROUGH OBEYING ALLAH'S GUIDANCE 
BY FOLLOWING ISLAM MUSLIMS BELIEVE THEY'LL FIND PEACE WITH ALLAH 
EACH OTHER AND THE WORLD AROUND THEM 
I FEEL PRIVILEGED AND ACTUALLY FORTUNATE TO BE A MUSLIM 
BECAUSE I HAVE A SENSE OF DIRECTION I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING 
IT'S FROM GETTING UP IN THE MORNING TO GOING TO SLEEP AT NIGHT 
EVERYTHING YOU SEE AND DO 
WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING YOU SAY 
THANKS GOD FOR ME BEING ALIVE 
PEACE WITH MYSELF AND WITH PEOPLE AROUND ME 
IT MAKES IT MUCH EASIER FOR ME TO FORGIVE AND ACCEPT 
I'M MORE INCLINED TO HELP OTHERS 
BECAUSE 
THERE'S A UNIVERSAL LOVE INVOLVED YOU KNOW WITH ALLAH 
ISLAM MEANS PEACE IT MEANS OBEDIENCE TO THE ONE AND ONLY GOD 
IF YOU DO THAT IT BRINGS PEACE 
YOU'RE GUIDED IN THE RIGHT PATH EVERYTHING'S SET OUT FOR YOU 
YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOOD AND BAD 
EVERY BIT OF BLOOD THAT IS COURSING THROUGH YOUR VEINS IS ISLAM 
EVERY TEAR YOU CRY EVERY THOUGHT YOU THINK 
IT'S ALL YOUR FAITH IT'S ALL WHO YOU ARE 
WHEREVER A PERSON IS IN THE WORLD THEY BECOME A MUSLIM BY RECITING THE SHAHADAH 
BY WORSHIPPING ALLAH I FOLLOW THE FIVE PILLARS OF ISLAM 
THEY ARE 
PRAYER FIVE TIMES A DAY 
FASTING DURING THE MONTH OF RAMADAN 
I HOPE YOU INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR NOTES 
IT STATES 
THEY ALSO INCLUDE 
THE YOUNG PEOPLE SPOKE OF THE WAY ISLAM GIVES THEM 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON UNDERSTANDING 
WITH SOME UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT FOLLOWERS OF A RELIGION BELIEVE 
YOU CAN BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT HOW IT AFFECTS PEOPLE'S LIVES 
IN OTHER WORDS EXPLAIN WHY RELIGIOUS PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY DO 
TO GET AT THE MEANING 
MAKE A NOTE OF THESE QUESTIONS 
IF YOU CAN ANSWER THEM YOU'LL SHOW YOU HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING 
OF THE EFFECTS OF A RELIGION 
WE'LL DO THIS BY LOOKING AT DIFFERENT KINDS OF RELIGIOUS ACTIVITY AND BELIEF 
SUCH AS 
FIRST LET'S LOOK AT THE JEWISH ROSH HASHANAH AND YOM KIPPUR 
IN THIS CLIP A GIRL DESCRIBES TWO SPECIAL TIMES IN THE JEWISH YEAR 
WHILE YOU WATCH THINK ABOUT THE QUESTIONS AND NOTE SOME ANSWERS 
IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE HOLIEST PERIOD OF OUR YEAR 
ROSH HASHANAH IS FOLLOWED BY YOM KUPPUR THE DAY OF ATONEMENT 
THESE TEN DAYS ARE A TIME FOR REFLECTION 
ROSH HASHANAH IS THE BIRTHDAY OF THE HUMAN RACE 
THE DAY GOD CREATED THE FIRST HUMANS 
ON THIS DAY GOD JUDGES US FOR EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE 
AND DECIDES WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO US 
AT ROSH HASHANAH WE ADDRESS GOD AS A KING JUDGING HIS WORLD 
EACH MORNING A SHOFAR A RAM'S HORN IS BLOWN 
IT'S ONE OF THE OLDEST INSTRUMENTS AND WAS USED TO ANNOUNCE THE KING 
IT REMINDS US OF THE APPROACH OF GOD OUR KING AS YOM KIPPUR GETS CLOSER 
ON YOM KIPPUR ITSELF 
WE DON'T EAT ANYTHING FOR TWENTY FIVE HOURS 
THE FAST HELPS US TO CONCENTRATE ONLY ON GOD 
SOMETIMES I CAN ONLY THINK OF FOOD 
YOM KIPPUR IS THE HOLIEST DAY OF THE JEWISH YEAR 
DURING THE PRAYERS WE CONFESS OUR SINS AND ASK FORGIVENESS 
BEFORE THE FIRST SERVICE THE KOL NIDREI IS CHANTED 
IN SOME SYNAGOGUES 
THE KOL NIDREI IS SUNG BY THE CHOIR 
IT REMINDS US OF WHEN JEWS WERE FORCED TO ACCEPT CHRISTIANITY OR DIE 
SECRETLY THEY LIVED ON AS JEWS 
EACH YEAR THEY DECLARED TO GOD THAT ANY VOWS THEY WERE FORCED TO MAKE WOULD NOT COUNT 
THEY TOOK GREAT RISKS IN ORDER TO REMAIN JEWS 
WE PRAY FIVE TIMES ON YOM KIPPUR 
WE READ FROM THE TORAH AND THE BOOK OF JONAH 
GOD IS ALWAYS READY TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO REPENT THEIR SINS 
YOM KIPPUR ENDS WITH THE NE'ILAH THE CLOSING OF THE GATES 
THEN THE JUDGEMENTS MADE BY GOD ON ROSH HASHANAH ARE SEALED 
THE DOORS OF THE ARK SYMBOLISING THE GATES OF HEAVEN REMAIN OPEN 
AT THIS SERVICE WE REPEAT THREE TIMES 
HEAR O. ISRAEL THE LORD IS OUR GOD THE LORD IS ONE 
BLESSED IS THE NAME OF HIS GLORIOUS KINGDOM FOREVER AND EVER 
FINALLY WE SAY THE EXPRESSION THE LORD IS GOD SEVEN TIMES 
THERE IS A SINGLE BLAST ON THE SHOFAR AND THE FAST IS OVER 
HERE ARE THE POINTS WE THOUGHT WERE IMPORTANT 
IT'S MARKED BY 
IT'S MARKED BY 
THESE FESTIVALS SHOW 
THEY FOCUS ON 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON ROSH HASHANNAH AND YOM KIPPUR 
NOW A LOOK AT THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENT IN THE MUSLIM CALENDAR 
THE HAJ OR PILGRIMAGE TO MAKKAH 
REMEMBER OUR QUESTIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING MEANINGS 
HERE ARE SOME TYPES OF QUESTION FROM THE EXAM 
WHILE YOU WATCH MAKE NOTES TO HELP YOU ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT ISLAM 
HERE'S A TIP 
TO GET THE MARKS YOU NEED TO 
EVERY MUSLIM SHOULD PERFORM THIS DUTY DURING THEIR LIFETIME 
AS LONG AS THEY CAN AFFORD TO AND ARE PHYSICALLY FIT 
HAJ TAKES PLACE DURING THE MONTH OF DHUL HIJJAH 
IT'S THE WORLD'S LARGEST SPIRITUAL GATHERING 
WITH PILGRIMS ARRIVING IN ARABIA AT THE RATE OF THREE HUNDRED FORTY A MINUTE 
SOME PEOPLE SAVE ALL THEIR LIVES TO BE ABLE TO COME 
OTHERS HAVE BEEN PAID FOR BY THEIR FAMILIES OR COMMUNITIES 
WHATEVER THEIR WEALTH IN HAJ THEY WILL ALL BE EQUAL ALL UNITED BEFORE ALLAH 
TO SHOW THIS THE FIRST THING MALES DO IS BATHE 
AND PUT ON TWO WHITE UNSEWN SHEETS 
WOMEN TOO DRESS SIMPLY 
THE PILGRIM HAS NOW ENTERED A STATE OF IHRAM PURITY 
AND MUST CONCENTRATE ON PRAYER 
ALL SHOULD KEEP THEIR MINDS AT PEACE 
IN SPITE OF THE CROWDS 
ALL SHOULD BEHAVE WITH HUMILITY AND PATIENCE 
THE FIRST THING IS TO GO TO THE MASJID AL HARAM THE SACRED MOSQUE 
TO GREET THE KA'BAH 
THE PRAYER THEY WILL SAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS THE TALBIYAH 
THE ANSWER TO THE CALL TO COME 
JUST AS MUHAMMAD DID THEY START AT THE BLACK STONE 
AND WALK SEVEN TIMES AROUND THE KA'BAH IN WORSHIP OF ALLAH 
THIS IS CALLED TAWAF 
MANY WILL TRY TO TOUCH THE STONE 
EMBEDDED IN THE EASTERN CORNER THIS STONE MEASURES TWENTY C. M. ACROSS AND WAS KISSED BY THE PROPHET 
THOSE THAT CAN'T GET CLOSE WILL RAISE THEIR RIGHT HAND IN GREETING 
YOU COME ALIVE SPIRITUALLY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT DIFFERENT RACES 
NOT A PARTICULAR RACE ALL RACES AND ALL COLOURS 
EVERYONE MEETING FOR A COMMON PURPOSE FOR THE WORSHIP OF ALLAH 
ON THE SECOND DAY THE PILGRIMS TRAVEL TO THE PLAIN OF ARAFAT 
WHERE MUHAMMAD GAVE HIS FAREWELL SPEECH 
HIS SPEECH WAS FOLLOWED BY THIS REVELATION OF ALLAH'S WORDS 
PILGRIMS MAKE THEIR STAND BEFORE ALLAH ON THE MOUNT OF MERCY 
THEY HAVE TO BE THERE BETWEEN NOON AND DUSK 
DAY THREE SEES THE PILGRIMS IN MINA STONING THE DEVILS 
SEVEN STONES ARE THROWN AT EACH OF THE THREE PILLARS TO COMMEMORATE IBRAHIM'S REJECTION OF SATAN 
AT MINA THE FESTIVAL OF ID UL ADHA IS CELEBRATED 
A CENTRAL PART OF IT IS THE SACRIFICE OF AN ANIMAL 
NOTHING IS WASTED THE MEAT IS SENT TO FEED THE POOR 
AFTERWARDS MANY MEN HAVE THEIR HEAD SHAVED 
AND WOMEN CUT OFF A LOCK OF HAIR 
THE FESTIVAL OF ID UL ADHA IS THE MAIN FESTIVAL IN THE MUSLIM CALENDAR 
IT REMINDS MUSLIMS THEY SHOULD BE READY TO GIVE UP THEIR POSSESSIONS 
MUSLIMS ALL OVER THE WORLD CELEBRATE THIS FESTIVAL 
IN THIS WAY ALL MUSLIMS FEEL THEY'RE A PART OF THE PILGRIMAGE 
EVEN IF THEY'RE MILES AWAY 
THE PILGRIMS MAY STAY AT MINA FOR A FEW DAYS BEFORE RETURNING TO MAKKAH 
WHERE THEY MAKE SEVEN CIRCUITS OF THE KA'BAH 
THE RITES OF PILGRIMAGE ARE COMPLETE 
EVERY MAN IS NOW A HAJJI AND EVERY WOMAN A HAJJAH 
O. K. HOW DID YOU DO 
OUR LIST INCLUDES 
ONE PRAYER SAID DURING THE HAJ SAYS HERE I AM ALLAH IN RESPONSE TO YOUR CALL 
SYMBOLISED BY THE FACT THAT ALL PILGRIMS WEAR SIMPLE WHITE CLOTH 
ANYONE WHO BELIEVES IN ALLAH AND SUBMITS TO HIS WILL IS A MUSLIM 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON MUSLIM HAJ 
NOW THE CHRISTIAN SERVICE OF ASH WEDNESDAY AT THE BEGINNING OF LENT 
THIS CLIP SHOWS A CELEBRATION IN A CHURCH OF ENGLAND CATHEDRAL 
ASK YOURSELF OUR THREE QUESTIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING MEANINGS 
THE ASH WEDNESDAY SERVICE AT THE BEGINNING OF LENT 
IS THE TIME TO REFLECT ON LIFE AND GET READY FOR EASTER 
LENT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR CHORISTER WILLIAM INNES 
IT'S A TIME TO REPENT FOR YOUR SINS 
WHEN I SAY REPENT I MEAN NOT JUST TO BE SORRY BUT TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T DO IT AGAIN 
REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE DUST AND UNTO DUST YOU SHALL RETURN 
TURN AWAY FROM SIN AND BE FAITHFUL TO CHRIST 
THIS TIME THE SIGN OF THE CROSS IS MADE FROM ASHES 
REMEMBER YOU ARE DUST AND TO DUST YOU WILL RETURN 
TURN AWAY FROM SIN AND BE FAITHFUL TO CHRIST 
REMEMBER YOU ARE DUST AND TO DUST YOU WILL RETURN 
TURN AWAY FROM SIN AND BE FAITHFUL TO CHRIST 
REMEMBER YOU ARE DUST AND TO DUST YOU WILL RETURN 
I THINK THE SINGING PART OF THE SERVICE CAN BE QUITE IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE ESPECIALLY THE MUSIC WE DO ON ASH WEDNESDAY 
IS OFTEN QUITE ATMOSPHERIC 
HERE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTED DOWN 
HIS RESURRECTION SHOWED HE HAD CONQUERED DEATH 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON CHRISTIAN ASH WEDNESDAY 
ONE OF THE BEST PLACES TO ANSWER THE QUESTION 
WHY DO RELIGIOUS PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY DO 
IS THEIR HOLY BOOK OR SACRED TEXT 
WE'LL LOOK AT THE TEXTS FROM THREE HOLY BOOKS 
MANY RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ARE BASED IN A SACRED BOOK 
PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW A RELIGION MAY SEE THE BOOK IN DIFFERENT WAYS 
IT CAN EVEN AS IN THE SIKH GURU GRANTH SAHIB JI BE 
THE FOLLOWING CLIP IS ABOUT THE MOST IMPORTANT JEWISH BOOK 
THE TORAH CONSISTS OF THE FIVE BOOKS OF MOSES 
IT TELLS THE STORY FROM CREATION TO THE DEATH OF MOSES 
SPANNING THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
JEWS HAVE ALWAYS COPIED THE WORDS OF THE TORAH ONTO PARCHMENT 
THE SCROLL MAY TAKE FIVE YEARS TO COMPLETE AND NEEDS GREAT CARE 
BECAUSE THESE ARE THE WORDS OF GOD 
THE TORAH TELLS US HOW WE CAN LIVE AND FULFIL GOD'S WILL 
TODAY YOU'LL FIND TORAH SCROLLS IN SYNAGOGUES 
KEPT IN HONOURED PLACES 
IT MAY HAVE DIFFERENT TORAHS BUT THEY CONTAIN THE SAME WORDS 
I'VE BEEN A RABBI FOR THIRTY YEARS 
EVERY YEAR ONE CAN SEE THE STORIES AND THE LAWS THROUGH DIFFERENT EYES 
IT IS AS ALIVE AS IT WAS WHEN IT WAS FIRST GIVEN THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO 
THE STORIES ABOUT ADAM AND EVE 
AND THE WAY THEY ACTED IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN 
ARE THERE TO TEACH US ABOUT SELF CONTROL 
THE STORY OF JOSEPH AND HIS BROTHERS IS THERE TO TEACH US ABOUT HOW BROTHERS SHOULD BEHAVE 
SOMETIMES ONE BROTHER SHOWS OFF AND CAUSES PROBLEMS IN THE FAMILY 
SO THE TORAH ITSELF IS A DOCUMENT 
THAT CONTAINS MUCH MORE THAN LAWS MUCH MORE THAN HISTORY MUCH MORE THAN STORIES 
IT IS THE BASIS OF OUR JEWISH RELIGION 
THE TORAH BINDS THE JEWS AS ONE FAMILY 
ALL OVER THE WORLD IN DIFFERENT SYNAGOGUES DIFFERENT TYPES OF JEWS AND WORSHIP 
ONE THING REMAINS THE SAME THE TORAH 
HOW DID YOU DO HERE ARE SOME OF THE POINTS YOU NEED TO REMEMBER 
THE QUR'AN ON THE OTHER HAND IS 
THE QUR'AN IS THE SACRED BOOK OF ISLAM REVEALED TO MUHAMMAD 
MUSLIMS BELIEVE IT CONTAINS THE ACTUAL WORDS OF ALLAH 
THIS WAS ALLAH'S COMPLETE MESSAGE TO HUMANKIND 
THE WORDS HAVE REMAINED UNCHANGED FOR ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED YEARS 
THE QUR'AN TELLS MUSLIMS WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ALLAH AND HOW TO LIVE THEIR LIVES 
THE QUR'AN IS THE WORD OF GOD 
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT BOOK FOR ME 
IT ISN'T WRITTEN BY AN AUTHOR BUT BY YOUR CREATOR 
THE QUR'AN HAS ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN CHAPTERS SURAHS 
EACH OF WHICH HAS A NAME RELATING TO ITS FIRST WORD 
OR SOMETHING IMPORTANT IN IT 
THE QUR'AN IS NOT A STORY 
SURAHS ARE ARRANGED IN AN ORDER THAT WAS REVEALED TO MUHAMMAD 
THE QUR'AN IS THE WORDS OF ALLAH 
THE SUNNAH IS EVERYTHING THE PROPHET DID OR SAID 
THE WORD SUNNAH MEANS 
MUSLIMS REGARD MUHAMMAD AS THE LIVING EXAMPLE OF ISLAMIC BEHAVIOUR 
THEY FOLLOW HIS SUNNAH FOR FURTHER GUIDANCE 
ON HOW TO BEHAVE AS A GOOD MUSLIM 
HERE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS YOU NEED TO REMEMBER 
WATCH THIS CLIP ABOUT A CHRISTIAN WHO TRIES TO PUT INTO ACTION SOME TEXTS FROM THE NEW TESTAMENT 
I WAS IN ACADEMIC LIFE FOR SEVERAL YEARS 
AND FINISHED UP AS A PROFESSOR AT A UNIVERSITY 
I LIKED IT BUT THERE WAS A SENSE OF UNEASE ABOUT WHAT I WAS DOING IT DIDN'T SQUARE WITH MY CHRISTIANITY 
HIYA PADDY ARE YOU GOING SWIMMING TOMORROW AYE 
SO THAT MEANS YOU'LL BE GOING TWICE THIS WEEK AYE YOU LUCKY THING 
THIS SLIP IS FOR FRIDAY O. K. H. M. M. 
THE EXAMPLE OF JESUS WAS THAT HE LEFT HEAVEN 
AND SPENT NEARLY ALL HIS TIME WITH PEOPLE IN SOCIAL NEED 
I THOUGHT I HAD TO COPY THAT 
AT THE SAME TIME I FELT A BIT OF A HYPOCRITE 
REALLY I WAS MAKING MONEY FROM TEACHING ABOUT POVERTY 
IN FACT I WROTE A BOOK ABOUT POVERTY HERE IT IS 
I MADE MONEY FROM THIS 
I HOPE MY STUDENTS BENEFITED FROM IT BUT DID IT DO THE POOR ANY GOOD 
I FELT THAT I WASN'T CHALLENGING WHAT WAS WRONG IN OUR SOCIETY 
SO I GAVE UP UNIVERSITY LIFE WORKED ON A COMMUNITY PROJECT AND FINISHED UP HERE IN EASTERHOUSE 
A SURVEY IN EASTERHOUSE FOUND THAT EIGHTY FOUR PER CENT OF PEOPLE SAID THE PROBLEMS WERE DRUGS VANDALISM AND GANG FIGHTING 
THE SAME SURVEY ALSO FOUND THAT EIGHTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE SAID THE MAIN NEED HERE 
WAS FOR YOUTH AMENITIES 
BUT YOUTH CLUBS CAN'T SOLVE UNEMPLOYMENT 
AND OVER FIFTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE OF WORKING AGE HERE ARE UNEMPLOYED 
ON THE ESTATE THE SALVATION ARMY RUNS A FURNITURE STORE 
SECOND HAND GOODS CAN BE BOUGHT BY THOSE FAMILIES WHO CAN AFFORD IT OR GIVEN TO THOSE WHO CAN'T 
I START FROM THE POINT OF VIEW THAT GOD CREATED ALL PEOPLE EQUAL IN HIS SIGHT 
ALSO THEY'RE EQUAL BETWEEN EACH OTHER 
IT FOLLOWS I THINK THAT THE GOOD THINGS OF THIS EARTH SHOULD BE SHARED OUT AMONGST PEOPLE 
BE IT INCOME WEALTH FURNITURE HOLIDAYS RESPONSIBILITIES 
THE AIM OF A CHRISTIAN SOCIETY IS TO SHARE THE THINGS OF THIS EARTH 
I THINK CHRISTIANS SHOULD TAKE A MODEST INCOME AND USE WHAT THEY'VE GOT FOR OTHERS 
I'VE GOT A CAR MOST PEOPLE HERE HAVEN'T 
I HOPE I CAN USE IT IN THE SERVICE OF OTHER PEOPLE 
SO HOW DID YOU DO THE CLIP REFERS TO TWO TEXTS 
MATTHEW'S PASSAGE IS A CHALLENGING TEACHING 
LUKE'S PASSAGE EXPRESSES A SIMILAR IDEA 
WHEN LOOKING AT PASSAGES FOR YOUR REVISION 
EVERY YEAR EXAMINERS COMMENT 
THAT CANDIDATES DON'T QUOTE FROM THE HOLY BOOKS 
MAKE SURE YOU AREN'T ONE OF THESE 
GO THROUGH EACH TOPIC AND WRITE A QUOTE FROM THE HOLY BOOK NEXT TO IT 
THEN IN THE EXAM IF YOU'RE ASKED TO GIVE YOUR POINT OF VIEW 
YOU CAN SUPPORT YOUR IDEA WITH A RELEVANT QUOTE FROM THE HOLY BOOK 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON HOLY BOOKS 
EXPLAINING THE BELIEFS AND PRACTICES OF RELIGIOUS PEOPLE 
MEANS UNDERSTANDING THEIR VIEW OF LIFE AFTER DEATH 
THIS SECTION LOOKS AT VIEWS ON LIFE AFTER DEATH 
IN THE CHRISTIAN HINDU AND MUSLIM RELIGION 
IN A MOMENT YOU'LL SEE THREE CLIPS ABOUT VIEWS OF LIFE AFTER DEATH 
WATCH THEM CAREFULLY 
DEATH IS CERTIFIED WHEN THE HEART AND BREATHING STOP 
WE KNOW DEATH HAS OCCURRED BECAUSE PATIENTS WHOSE HEART AND BREATHING STOP DON'T COME BACK TO LIFE 
TODAY MACHINES CAN KEEP HEARTS AND LUNGS WORKING FOR AS LONG AS WE WANT 
SO HOW DO YOU THEN DECIDE WHETHER THE PERSON IS DEAD OR NOT 
WE DO TESTS TO DETERMINE IF THE BRAIN IS DEAD 
IF THE BRAIN IS DEAD SO'S THE PERSON 
DEATH IS A ONCE AND FOR ALL FINAL EVENT 
THOSE WHO TALK ABOUT AN OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE HAVEN'T DIED 
SO THEY DON'T GIVE ME ANY INFORMATION ON LIFE AFTER DEATH 
NEUROSURGEONS MAKE LIFE AND DEATH DECISIONS EVERY DAY 
THEY MUST BASE THESE ON HARD EVIDENCE 
THIS MACHINE SCANS THE PATIENT'S HEAD AND SHOWS SECTIONS OF THE BRAIN AND THE TUMOUR 
I WILL ANALYSE THESE SCANNED PICTURES CAREFULLY BEFORE I OPERATE ON THE PATIENT 
TO LENGTHEN OR SHORTEN THEIR LIFE 
EVIDENCE IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME AS A DOCTOR AND AS A CHRISTIAN 
AS A DOCTOR I RELY ON WHAT IS PUBLISHED FROM OTHERS' RESEARCH 
AS A CHRISTIAN I RELY ON WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE BIBLE 
I KNOW THAT HAS BEEN CHECKED BY EXPERTS MORE THOROUGHLY THAN WHAT I READ IN MEDICAL JOURNALS 
SO AS A CHRISTIAN 
DOES THE WAY HE LEADS HIS LIFE HAVE ANY EFFECT ON HIS LIFE AFTER DEATH 
LIFE IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF CHANCE AND THAT WHAT I DO MATTERS TO GOD 
THE RELATIONSHIP I HAVE WITH GOD WILL CONTINUE AFTER I DIE 
WHO AM I WELL AS A HINDU I DON'T BELIEVE I'M THIS BODY 
I THINK I'M THE SOUL INSIDE THIS IS KNOWN AS THE ATMA 
THAT'S WHO I REALLY AM 
MEDICINE HAS ITS UPS AND DOWNS 
I MEAN IT'S A REAL SHOCK WHEN YOU SEE A DEAD BODY FOR THE FIRST TIME 
DEATH'S STRANGE IT'S SO FINAL 
IF YOU LOOK AT A DEAD BODY A FEW MINUTES BEFORE AND AFTER DEATH'S ACTUALLY HAPPENED 
IT LOOKS THE SAME BUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT'S GONE 
MODERN SCIENCE CAN DO SO MANY THINGS TODAY 
WE CAN KEEP ORGANS WORKING BUT THE PERSON WON'T COME BACK TO LIFE 
THAT BODY WON'T COME BACK TO LIFE THE SOUL IS ETERNAL 
SO FOR ME AFTER DEATH THERE'S ANOTHER LIFE 
THAT'S WHAT REINCARNATION MEANS THE SOUL JUST MOVES ON TO ANOTHER BODY 
ACCORDING TO KAMMA WHERE YOUR SOUL MOVES ONTO IN YOUR NEXT LIFE 
DEPENDS ON HOW YOU'VE LED YOUR LIFE 
IF YOU'VE LED A LIFE OF DEVOTION TO GOD AND ACTING TO PLEASE HIM 
YOUR SOUL MOVES ONTO A HIGHER FORM 
THE ULTIMATE IS BEING WITH GOD AND FREE FROM THE BODY FROM THE MISERIES LIKE BIRTH DISEASE DEATH 
IF YOU'VE NOT BEEN GOOD 
YOUR SOUL CAN MOVE FROM BEING IN A PLANT TO BEING AN ANIMAL 
SCRIPTURE SAYS THERE'S EIGHTY FOUR MILLION LIFE FORMS SO THERE ARE MANY OPTIONS 
ALL MUSLIMS BELIEVE IN AKHIRAH LIFE AFTER DEATH 
ON DEATH THE BODY IS PLACED IN THE GRAVE 
AND THE SOUL REMAINS IN A STATE OF WAITING CALLED BARZAKH 
ON JUDGEMENT DAY MUSLIMS WILL BE BROUGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE WAY THEY HAVE LIVED THEIR LIFE 
IF THEY HAVE ACTED CRUELLY ON EARTH THEY WILL BE PUNISHED BY ALLAH 
JIHANNAM HELL AWAITS THEM 
WITH ITS BURNING FIRES AND ETERNAL TORMENT 
IF A MUSLIM HAS BEHAVED WELL 
THEY WILL SPEND ETERNITY IN JANNAH PARADISE 
IN A STATE OF ETERNAL JOY AND BEAUTY HAPPINESS AND PEACE 
BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE WHAT AWAITS THERE 
PARADISE AND HELL ARE BEYOND HUMAN UNDERSTANDING 
FOR MUSLIMS IT'S ENOUGH TO KNOW THEY'RE ACCOUNTABLE FOR NO ONE KNOWS WHEN DEATH MIGHT COME 
HOW DID YOU DO HERE'S A CHECK LIST OF POINTS FROM THE CLIP 
THE CHRISTIAN IN THE FIRST CLIP SAID TWO IMPORTANT THINGS 
HE'S A DOCTOR BUT 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON LIFE AFTER DEATH 
AND ALSO THE SECTION ON EXPLAINING 
WE'VE COVERED FACTS AND DEVELOPED SKILLS TO EXPLAIN RELIGIOUS BELIEF 
NOW WE MUST APPLY OUR UNDERSTANDING TO DISCUSSION OF RELIGIOUS ISSUES 
FIRST WE'LL LOOK AT HOW RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AFFECT THE WAY PEOPLE THINK 
ABOUT A COUPLE OF KEY CONTEMPORARY ISSUES SUCH AS RACISM AND ABORTION 
SO MAKE SURE YOU WATCH THE NEWS OR READ A NEWSPAPER 
LOOK AT THESE TWO CLIPS WHICH FOCUS ON RACISM 
AND THINK ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS 
THERE IS NO ONE ANSWER 
BUT IT'S ONE YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT FOR YOURSELF 
OUR COUSIN WAS MURDERED BECAUSE OF THE COLOUR OF HIS SKIN 
ROHIT WAS OUR COUSIN A VERY CLOSE ONE 
HE WAS MURDERED IN A RACIST ATTACK IT WAS ABOUT THREE IN THE MORNING 
I WAS SLEEPING AND I KEPT ON HEARING THESE PHONE CALLS 
DAD PICKED UP THE PHONE HE GOES WHAT'S HAPPENED 
AND THEN HE SAID THAT ROHIT HAD DIED I STARTED TO BURST OUT CRYING 
I COULDN'T MOVE AND I COULDN'T TAKE IT IN 
AND I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT AT FIRST AND EVERYTHING WENT REALLY BLANK 
AND I THOUGHT HE'D COME BACK BUT REALLY I KNEW HE WOULDN'T 
ROHIT HAD JUST FINISHED HIS GCSES 
AND HIS EXAMS WERE OVER 
AND BASICALLY HE JUST WENT OUT WITH A COUPLE OF MATES TO CELEBRATE 
AFTER THE PARTY WAS OVER THEY WENT INTO THE KEBAB SHOP 
INSIDE WERE SOME WHITE YOUTHS AND THEY STARTED CALLING ROHIT NAMES 
HE WENT OUTSIDE AND THEY FOLLOWED HIM 
I THINK THERE WERE SOME REMARKS SOME RACIST REMARKS 
AND A BOY CALLED PETER THOMPSON 
HE TOOK THIS RATHER LARGE KNIFE LIKE A DAGGER LIKE KNIFE 
AND I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY TIMES 
BUT HE STABBED HIM IN THE HEART REALLY WHERE IT HURT 
IT WENT QUITE DEEP INTO HIS HEART 
ROHIT WAS SIXTEEN WHEN HE WAS MURDERED 
TWO WEEKS AFTER ROHIT DIED WE WENT TO HIS HOUSE TO TIDY THINGS UP 
IT WAS QUITE SAD BECAUSE MY AUNTIE WAS JUST SITTING DOWN THERE 
PACKING THEM SLOWLY AND SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT THEM 
SMELLING THEM AND HUGGING THEM 
THAT'S HOW SHE WAS REMEMBERING HIM 
HELLO HOW ARE YOU 
IT'S HARD TO COME TO TERMS WITH HOW ROHIT DIED BECAUSE HE WAS MURDERED 
IF HE'D DIED IN A CAR CRASH YOU CAN ACCEPT THAT 
BUT BEING MURDERED ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S A RACIST MURDER IS BAD 
BEING KNIVED AS WELL 
HIS ROOM IS MUCH THE SAME AS IT WAS AS WE FEEL IT SHOULD BE LIKE THAT 
I'M STILL VERY ANGRY AT WHAT THOSE PEOPLE DONE 
AND I DON'T THINK I COULD EVER FORGIVE THEM 
BUT I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER ROHIT 
I THINK RACISM EXISTS IN ALL COMMUNITIES ALL COUNTRIES 
BETWEEN BLACK AND ASIAN EVERYTHING 
AND IT'S JUST THE MOST OBVIOUS IS COLOUR RACISM I THINK 
I MEAN I HAVEN'T BEEN ATTACKED PHYSICALLY BUT WHEN I'M ON THE BUS 
WHEN I'M ON THE TUBE I GET CALLED NAMES 
AND IT'S BECAUSE OF MY COLOUR 
DO YOU HAVE FRIENDS ACROSS THE RACES 
DO YOU HAVE BLACK FRIENDS 
WHAT DO YOU I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST THEM 
WOULD YOU GO OUT WITH A BLACK BOY IF THERE WAS SOMEONE I LIKED YEAH 
WOULD YOU YEAH YOU'D HAVE A BLACK BOYFRIEND 
YEAH HAVE YOU GOT ONE NO BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU'D RULE OUT 
NO WOULD YOU 
I DON'T THINK I COULD COS OF MY FAMILY WHY MY DAD WOULD KILL ME 
WHY BECAUSE MY DAD'S RACIST 
RACISM FOR ME IS ANTI SEMITISM 
I ACCEPT YOUR POINT ABOUT IT BEING BLACK AND WHITE 
IF IT WERE YOU ME AND SOME OTHER WHITE PEOPLE AND SOMEONE CAME IN WHO WAS RACIST I'D BE THE FIRST 
TO GET CALLED A NAME DIVIDING PEOPLE BY THEIR RELIGION IS AS BAD AS DIVIDING PEOPLE BY RACE 
FATIMA I DON'T AGREE IT'S TO DO WITH COMPATIBILITY 
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND RELIGION YOU CAN'T SAY OH IT'S BAD BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND MY FAITH 
AND I RESPECT WHAT MY FAITH SAYS 
WHAT CAUSES RACIAL DISCRIMINATION WHERE DOES IT COME 
IGNORANCE LACK OF EDUCATION ON OTHER PEOPLE'S CULTURES 
LACK OF RESPECT WHAT CAUSES IT 
I THINK IT'S WHAT SHE SAYS 
IF YOU GIVE A CHILD SOMETHING IT DOESN'T LIKE IT IT REJECTS IT 
U. F. O.'S ALIENS WE'RE SCARED BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S OUT THERE 
WE'RE SCARED OF WHAT WE DON'T KNOW 
HOPEFULLY YOU'LL HAVE PICKED UP ON THE IDEA 
THAT ALTHOUGH THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF RACISM 
THEY ALL INVOLVE TREATING SOMEONE AS LESS THAN FULLY HUMAN 
SOLELY BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE OR COLOUR 
NOW ANOTHER CONTEMPORARY ISSUE WHICH EXCITES VERY STRONG FEELINGS 
DON'T ASSUME KNOWING A PERSON'S RELIGION MEANS YOU CAN PREDICT 
WHAT THEY THINK VIEWS CAN DIFFER WITHIN FAITHS 
LOOK AT THIS SAMPLE EXAM QUESTION 
BEAR IN MIND THAT ANGLICANISM INCLUDING THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND 
AND ROMAN CATHOLICISM ARE DIFFERENT DENOMINATIONS OF CHRISTIANITY 
AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL CROSSES THE THRESHOLD OF A HIDDEN WORLD 
IT'S A PRIVATE CLINIC AND SHE'S COME FOR AN ABORTION 
ONE IN THREE WOMEN WILL HAVE ONE 
SHE'S NINE WEEKS PREGNANT SHE'S SINGLE AND ALREADY HAS A DAUGHTER 
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COPE MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY 
BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER TIRES ME OUT 
I COULDN'T COPE WITH TWO YOUNG CHILDREN RUNNING ABOUT ALL DAY LONG 
THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ABORTIONS A YEAR IN BRITAIN MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED A DAY 
ALAN ROGERS WILL DO THIRTY THIS MORNING 
HE'S ONE OF THE FEW DOCTORS WHO ALLOW US 
TO SEE HIS OPERATING THEATRE HE SAYS HE HAS NOTHING TO HIDE 
IT'S WRONG TO TRY AND MAKE A WOMAN FEEL GUILTY 
ABOUT SOMETHING SHE'S GOING TO DO 
FOR THIS GIRL ABORTION IS A LAST RESORT 
THE DECISION'S NOT BEEN EASY 
IF I COULD I'D GIVE THE BABY UP FOR ADOPTION BUT I COULDN'T DO THAT 
WHY BECAUSE IF I HAD THE BABY I WOULDN'T WANT TO LET IT GO 
IT IS A PART OF ME I'VE GIVEN BIRTH TO IT I COULDN'T LET IT GO 
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ANY OF THE WOMEN ON THIS OPERATING LIST 
AND NOTHING WRONG WITH THEIR BABIES THEIR ABORTION'S FOR SOCIAL REASONS 
AND LEGAL UP TO THE TWENTY FOURTH WEEK OF PREGNANCY 
IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO HAVE A BABY THEY SHOULD HAVE ONE IF THEY DON'T WANT A BABY THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE ONE 
THE DECISION IS MY DECISION NO ONE ELSE'S 
IT WILL BE MADE BY ME NO ONE ELSE 
AND I WILL NOT BE MADE TO FEEL GUILTY 
WE'VE DECIDED IT'S NOT A CHILD BEFORE THE TWENTY FOURTH WEEK 
WHO DECIDED THE MEDICAL PROFESSION THE COUNTRY THE GOVERNMENT 
SOCIETY IN GENERAL 
WE DON'T KILL CHILDREN WHAT DO YOU KILL 
I TERMINATE PREGNANCIES YOU DON'T SEE IT AS A CHILD NO 
DO YOU SEE IT AS A POTENTIAL LIFE YES BUT SO ARE SPERMS AND EGGS 
POTENTIAL LIVES 
AS A CHRISTIAN I BELIEVE ALL LIFE IS GIVEN BY GOD 
AND IS SUSTAINED BY GOD 
SO ANY TAMPERING WITH LIFE KILLING OF LIFE OR TAKING OF LIFE 
IS A SERIOUS STEP TO TAKE 
BUT THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND HASN'T SAID WHAT ITS VIEW ON ABORTION IS 
AND THERE IS AN ASSUMPTION THAT MOST CHRISTIANS ARE AGAINST ABORTION 
PERSONALLY I FEEL ABORTION IN A PERFECT WORLD WOULD NOT EXIST 
ANY MORE THAN WAR WOULD 
BUT IN THE SAME WAY THAT WAR IS SOMETIMES THE RESORT YOU TURN TO 
SO ABORTION IS SOMETIMES THE BEST WAY OUT OF A BAD SITUATION 
IT'S THE MOST PRACTICAL AND THE BEST WAY TO GO FORWARD FOR THAT PERSON 
WITHIN THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH THERE IS A RANGE OF OPINIONS ABOUT ABORTION 
AT EITHER END YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO SAY ABORTION IS COMPLETELY WRONG 
THAT I THINK DOES NOT HELP WOMEN WHO DECIDE THAT AN ABORTION 
IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD AT THAT TIME 
FATHER MAURICE REIDY IS A PROFESSOR OF MORAL THEOLOGY 
I PUT TO HIM THE CRUX OF THE MATTER WHEN DOES HUMAN LIFE BEGIN 
STRICTLY SPEAKING WE MUST PRESUME 
THAT HUMAN LIFE IS PRESENT FROM THE BEGINNING 
THERE SEEMS NO OTHER SATISFACTORY POINT AT THIS STAGE OF SCIENCE 
TO JUDGE IT OTHER THAN FROM THE START 
SO THAT'S WHEN THE SPERM MEETS THE OVA WHEN THE TWO COME TOGETHER 
WHEN THE OVUM IS FERTILISED YES THAT IS HUMAN LIFE YES 
WE BELIEVE WE OPERATE ON THE PRESUMPTION THAT THAT IS HUMAN LIFE 
DOES THAT FERTILISED EGG HAVE THE STATUS OF A FULL INDIVIDUAL 
WE BELIEVE IT HAS THE STATUS OF A HUMAN BEING YES 
THEREFORE WE MUST RESPOND TO THAT STATUS AND RESPECT IT 
SO AN ABORTION IS THE EQUIVALENT OF MURDER YES 
FROM THE POPE DOWN THROUGH THE HIERARCHY OF THE CHURCH 
ITS PRIESTHOOD TEACHES THAT MOTHERHOOD IS THE SUPREME IDEAL 
THUS ABORTION IS ALWAYS AND UTTERLY WRONG 
TO HELP WITH YOUR ANSWER HERE ARE THE MAIN POINTS FROM THE CLIP 
GOD LOVES THE SINNER EVEN THOUGH GOD HATES THE SIN 
THE ROMAN CATHOLIC VIEW IS SET DOWN IN A TEACHING CALLED HUMANAE VITAE 
HERE ARE THE OUTLINES OF THREE DIFFERENT ANSWERS TO THE QUESTION 
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS WOULD BE HEADING FOR VERY DIFFERENT GRADES 
ANSWER ONE IS NOT EXACTLY WRONG BUT SHOWS NO UNDERSTANDING 
OF DIFFERENT DENOMINATIONS AND DOESN'T USE EVIDENCE 
THIS KIND OF ANSWER WOULD BE HEADING FOR GRADE F. 
THIS ANSWER DOES SHOW AWARENESS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DENOMINATIONS 
IT REFERS TO RELIGIOUS TEXTS OR FUNDAMENTAL BELIEFS 
IT STATES THE BELIEFS OF EACH GIVES EVIDENCE AND SETS THE ANSWER OUT CLEARLY AND LOGICALLY 
IT WOULD BE HEADING FOR A GRADE A 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON CONTEMPORARY ISSUES 
NOW ULTIMATE QUESTIONS 
YOU CAN'T STUDY R. S. WITHOUT MEETING SOME ULTIMATE QUESTIONS 
THAT HUMANS HAVE ALWAYS ASKED AND RELIGIONS HAVE TRIED TO ANSWER 
QUESTIONS LIKE 
YOU ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE YOUR OWN VIEWS ABOUT THEM AND THAT'S FINE 
WHILE YOU WATCH THE NEXT TWO CLIPS THINK ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS 
THESE ARE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS WHICH PHILOSOPHERS HAVE STRUGGLED WITH 
DON'T WORRY IF YOU FEEL DAUNTED 
JOT DOWN ANY THOUGHTS WHILE WATCHING THE CLIPS 
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO WATCH THEM MORE THAN ONCE 
DAWN AND AS THE SUN BREAKS THROUGH THE PIERCING CHILL OF NIGHT 
IT LIGHTS UP A BIBLICAL FAMINE NOW IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
THIS PLACE SAY WORKERS HERE IS THE CLOSEST THING TO HELL ON EARTH 
THOUSANDS OF WASTED PEOPLE ARE COMING HERE FOR HELP 
MANY FIND ONLY DEATH 
THEY FLOOD IN EVERY DAY FROM VILLAGES HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY 
DULLED BY HUNGER DRIVEN BEYOND THE POINT OF DESPERATION 
FIFTEEN THOUSAND CHILDREN ARE HERE NOW SUFFERING CONFUSED LOST 
LORD I CALL TO YOU FOR HELP EVERY MORNING I PRAY TO YOU 
WHY DO YOU REJECT ME LORD 
THIS IDEA OF ABANDONMENT AND BEING FORGOTTEN 
BOTH BY THE HUMAN RACE AND I THINK BY GOD 
THE CAMPS IN KOREM AND EVERYTHING 
THERE WAS A CURIOUSLY SPIRITUAL FEELING TO IT 
NOT NECESSARILY FEELING THE PRESENCE OF GOD BUT THE ABSENCE OF GOD 
DEATH IS ALL AROUND A CHILD OR AN ADULT DIES EVERY TWENTY MINUTES 
KOREM AN INSIGNIFICANT TOWN HAS BECOME A PLACE OF GRIEF 
LORD GOD MY SAVIOUR I CRY OUT ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT I COME BEFORE YOU 
HEAR MY PRAYER LISTEN TO MY CRY FOR HELP 
YOU ASK HOW THIS CAN BE TOLERATED BY A SUPREME BEING I'VE BEEN TOLD 
IS ALL POWERFUL AND ALL GOOD 
EITHER HE'S ALL POWERFUL AND HE'S NOT ALL GOOD OR HE'S ALL GOOD AND NOT ALL POWERFUL TO TOLERATE THIS 
THERE SEEMS NO JUSTIFICATION WITHIN MY PARTICULAR RELIGIOUS TEACHING 
TO BE ABLE SATISFACTORILY TO EXPLAIN WHAT I WAS SEEING 
OUR FIVE YEAR OLD SON SIMON WAS KILLED BY A DRUNKEN DRIVER 
JUST DOWN THE ROAD HERE 
AFTER A YEAR THE DRIVER EVENTUALLY CAME TO TRIAL 
WE WERE TOLD HOW HIS LIFE HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY GUILT 
WE WANTED TO PREVENT HIM HAVING IT FURTHER DESTROYED BY PRISON 
WE WROTE HIM A LETTER WHICH WE SUGGESTED HE MIGHT LIKE TO SHOW TO THE JUDGE SAYING WE FORGAVE HIM 
AND SO WHEN SOMEONE HURTS SOMEBODY ELSE 
THE RIGHT REACTION IS ANGER 
ANGER IS O. K. 
BUT WE HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING TO DO WITH OUR ANGER 
WE MAY HAVE TO FORGIVE THEM IT'S ALMOST SELFISH 
IT WILL HARM US IF WE DON'T IF WE'VE GOT ALL THAT BOTTLED UP ANGER 
THEN WE DESTROY OURSELVES BY OUR FAILURE TO FORGIVE 
YOU NEVER GET OVER THE DEATH OF SOMEONE YOU LOVE 
BUT I FELT I HAD TO DO IT 
I COULDN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF IF I DIDN'T 
I PRAY EVERY DAY FORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSES AS WE FORGIVE THOSE WHO TRESPASS AGAINST US 
AND I KNEW THAT GOD HAD HAD TO FORGIVE ME A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS 
AND THAT I COULDN'T RECEIVE GOD'S FORGIVENESS UNLESS I WAS 
WILLING TO FORGIVE OTHERS WHO WOULD ALSO SIN' 
YOU HUGGED THE DRIVER AND WEPT WITH HIM AFTER THE TRIAL 
WHY DID YOU DO THAT I COULDN'T HELP IT 
HE CAME OUT OF THE TRIAL HE WAS CHOKED AND I WAS CHOKED 
WE WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING TO EACH OTHER AND NOTHING WOULD COME OUT SO WE PUT OUR ARMS ROUND EACH OTHER 
ISN'T THERE A SENSE OF REVULSION IN PUTTING YOUR ARMS AROUND THE MAN WHO KILLED YOUR CHILD 
I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT IF HE DIDN'T SHOW ANY REMORSE AT ALL 
I UNDERSTAND THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM 
IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES ALL YOU CAN DO IS OFFER FORGIVENESS AND WAIT TO SEE IF IT'S ACCEPTED 
YOU HAVE TO FIND A WAY OF HATING THE SIN AND LOVING THE SINNER 
HERE ARE A FEW POSSIBLE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS WE ASKED 
ANSWERS RELIGIOUS PEOPLE OF ALMOST ANY FAITH MIGHT OFFER 
SO WHAT ANSWERS CAN RELIGION OFFER TO THESE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON ULTIMATE QUESTIONS 
THE LAST SECTION IS ABOUT ORGANISING AND EVALUATING VIEWS 
IN ORDER TO CONSTRUCT AN ARGUMENT ABOUT ISSUES OF FAITH AND BELIEF 
IN THE NEXT CLIP THE BOXER CHRIS EUBANK 
REFLECTS ON THE MEANING OF THE MUSLIM FESTIVAL OF RAMADAN 
AND THEY KNOW THE WAY IN WHICH TO GO THROUGH THEIR LIFE 
THEY DON'T REALLY NEED MUCH STEERING 
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DO NEED STEERING 
I THINK THAT THE QUR'AN AND ISLAM 
GIVES HUMAN BEINGS A CODE ON HOW TO LIVE 
ALLAH WE PRAY FOR YOU AND WE ASK HELP FROM YOU 
TO SEEK STRENGTH IN THE WORLDLY AFFAIRS IN WHICH WE LIVE 
RAMADAN FIRST AND FOREMOST IS A MONTH IN WHICH MUSLIMS FAST 
IT IS ONE OF THE FIVE PILLARS OF ISLAM 
PROBABLY SECOND MOST IMPORTANT 
NOW WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO ME 
O. K. BECAUSE I'VE I'VE 
BECAUSE MY CAREER HAS BEEN FIGHTING I UNDERSTAND WHAT FASTING DOES 
I'VE OFTEN STAYED AWAY FROM FOOD TO GET DOWN TO A PARTICULAR WEIGHT 
BUT WHAT IT DOES IT GIVES YOU AN INNER STRENGTH 
A TIME WHEN YOU REALLY ARE LOOKING INTO YOURSELF 
THAT'S WHERE GOD IS AT THE END OF THE DAY GOD IS WITHIN YOURSELF 
THE LINK BETWEEN MAN AND GOD IS NOT THE SYNAGOGUE OR CHURCH OR MOSQUE 
IT'S IN THE MAN'S MIND IT MAKES YOU REFLECT ON YOURSELF 
I WOULD SAY THAT YOU MIRROR IT LIKE THIS 
IN BOXING IF YOU LIVE BY THE RULES AND REGULATIONS YOU CAN BE CHAMPION 
EQUALLY YOU CAN LIVE BY THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF ISLAM 
IF YOU ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE IT THEN THE ONE THING THAT IS FOR SURE 
IS THAT YOU CAN INHERIT A BASICALLY GOOD AND DECENT LIFE 
NATURALLY AS HUMAN BEINGS WE ARE SELF DESTRUCTIVE 
IF WE'RE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO AND DO AS WE PLEASE 
THEN WE WILL DABBLE A BIT TOO FAR 
IN ISLAM YOU HAVE STRICT CODES WHERE YOU DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL 
YOU DO NOT CLOUD YOUR MIND WITH ANY TYPE OF SUBSTANCE 
I BELIEVE IN THAT 
I BELIEVE THAT AS HUMAN BEINGS WE NEED A CODE BY WHICH WE SHOULD LIVE 
AND IF WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES OR WHEN YOUR HEART STOPS 
IF IT ISN'T A HOAX THEN YOU'VE INHERITED EVERLASTING LIFE AS WELL 
IT'S NOT A BAD GAMBLE 
WHAT DID YOU THINK WERE YOU CONVINCED 
TO ARGUE WELL 
TO DO WELL IN THE R. S. EXAM YOU NEED TO BE AN ACE ARGUER 
CHECK THE BASIC TEACHINGS HOLY BOOK OR STATEMENTS BY ITS LEADERS 
LOOK AT THIS SAMPLE EXAM QUESTION 
HERE ARE THE OUTLINES OF TWO ANSWERS WHICH WOULD GAIN VERY DIFFERENT MARKS 
THIS IS NOT A GOOD ANSWER CAN YOU SEE WHY 
THE CANDIDATE HAS TALKED MOSTLY FROM THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE 
NO MENTION IS MADE OF THE VIEWS OF THE RELIGIONS THEY HAVE STUDIED 
THE EVIDENCE IS VERY LIMITED 
THE ANSWER IS ONE SIDED 
THIS CANDIDATE HAS OBVIOUSLY NOT WATCHED GCSE BITESIZE R. S. 
THIS IS A VERY GOOD ANSWER 
IT REFERS TO BELIEFS PRACTICES AND HOLY TEXTS 
IT SHOWS AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELIGIOUS MEANING OF FESTIVALS 
IT CONSIDERS DIFFERENT VIEWS AND USES LOGICAL ARGUMENT 
THE CANDIDATE FOLLOWED THE BITESIZE GUIDE AND IS HEADING FOR GRADE A 
THAT'S THE END OF THE SECTION ON MAKING AN ARGUMENT 
THINK ABOUT WHERE YOU WANT TO GO BEFORE YOU SIT DOWN TO REVISE 
YOU'LL REALISE IT'S WORTH THE EFFORT 
GOOD EXAM RESULTS GIVE YOU CHOICES IN LIFE BAD RESULTS LIMIT CHOICES 
IF FRIENDS SAY THEY'RE NOT REVISING THEY'RE LYING 
START WELL IN ADVANCE 
IT'S EASY TO PUT IT OFF BUT IF YOU START EARLY IT REALLY DOES HELP 
WHEN I LEARN LINES I DO IT IN THE SAME PLACE WITHOUT DISTRACTIONS 
IT HELPS ME FOCUS ON THE LEARNING 
TRY TO REVISE WITHOUT YOUR MUSIC 
OTHERWISE IT'LL BE HARD TO REMEMBER IN THE SILENCE OF THE EXAM ROOM 
DON'T EAT A BIG MEAL BEFORE AN EXAM 
IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL SLUGGISH AND YOU WON'T CONCENTRATE 
REVISION CAN BE BORING HAVE SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO 
PLAN A PARTY OR PROMISE YOURSELF A TREAT 
IN R. S. YOU HAVE TO USE QUOTES TO EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWERS 
SELECT THE SHORTEST AND EASIEST QUOTES AND HIGHLIGHT THEM 
THAT WAY YOU'LL REMEMBER THEM 
I USED TO GET NERVOUS GOING INTO RACES I'M SURE YOU WILL IN EXAMS 
JUST GO IN THERE BEING POSITIVE THE NERVES CAN HELP YOU 
THROW AWAY NEGATIVE THOUGHTS TELL YOURSELF I CAN DO THIS 
THAT'S THE END OF THE PROGRAMME ON WORLD RELIGIONS 
THE OTHER PROGRAMME ON RELIGIOUS STUDIES IS A NEW PROGRAMME ON PHILOSOPHY AND ETHICS 
YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION IN THE GCSE BITESIZE BOOKS 
AND ON THE WEBSITE 
I LIVE IN BIRMINGHAM WITH MY FAMILY 
ORIGINALLY WE COME FROM AZAD KASHMIR 
THE PART WE COME FROM IS PAKISTANI KASHMIR 
WHERE URDU IS THE WRITTEN LANGUAGE 
AND IF I WENT TO LIVE IN KASHMIR OR PAKISTAN 
I'D BE OBLIGED TO COMMUNICATE IN URDU 
I DON'T HAVE MUCH FAMILY LEFT IN KASHMIR 
MOST OF MY RELATIVES ARE HERE 
HOWEVER I HAVE MY GRANDFATHER ON MY MUM'S SIDE 
EACH TIME I SEE HIM HE'S ENCOURAGED ME TO LEARN URDU 
HE'S TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO ME THAT IF I LEAN I CAN WRITE LETTERS TO HIM 
YOU CAN READ NEWSPAPERS IN URDU 
HELLO GRANDAD HOW ARE YOU I HOPE YOU'RE WELL 
I HOPE TO SEE YOU WHEN I COME TO PAKISTAN 
IF YOU'D LIKE ME TO BRING ANYTHING PLEASE LET ME KNOW BYE SOPHIA
