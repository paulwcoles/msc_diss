IN U. K. AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS 
IT INJECT A FIFTY BILLION POUND 
LIFELINE INTO THE BANKING SYSTEM 
WE ASK IF THIS WILL WORK OR MERELY 
ENCOURAGE RECKLESS BEHAVIOUR IN 
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND BELIEVES THAT THESE 
MEASURES WILL SUPPORT THE BANKING 
SECTOR DURING THE PRESENT PERIOD OF 
UNCERTAINTY AND HELP RESTORE THE 
STABILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS 
BOTH NOW AND IN THE LONGER TERM 
THE PICTURES WHICH ZIMBABWE'S 
OPPOSITION SAKE TELL A STORY OF 
VIOLENT INTIMIDATION BY BACKERS OF 
PRESIDENT MUGABE 
WHY THIS WOMAN COULD MAKE ALL THE 
DIFFERENCE IN THE RACE TO BE THE 
NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE U. S. A. WE HEAR 
FROM THE DEMOCRAT'S SUPER DELEGATES 
ABOUT WHO THEY WILL BE VOTING FOR 
AND HARNESSING THE POWER OF THE 
CONGO RIVER TO BUILD THE WORLD'S 
BIGGEST HYDRO ELECTRIC DAM AND 
BRING ELECTRICITY TO MILLIONS IN 
AFRICA SO WHAT IS THE CATCH 
HELLO AND WELCOME IT COULD BE THE 
BIGGEST U. TURN IN THE HISTORY OF 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND LAST YEAR THE 
BANK RULED OUT EXTRA FUNDING FOR 
COMMERCIAL BANKS STRUGGLING TO COPE 
WITH THE CREDIT SQUEEZE TODAY IT 
PUMPED FIFTY BILLION AROUND ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS 
BILLION INTO THE BANKING SYSTEM 
DID PRE EMPT A LOSS OF CONFIDENCE 
THAT COULD TRIGGER AN ECONOMIC 
SLOWDOWN THE SCHEME IS EVEN MORE 
GENEROUS THAN THAT PROVIDED BY THE 
AMERICAN OR EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANKS 
SUPPORTERS OF THE MOVE SAY IT IS 
ABOUT TIME BUT CRITICS ARE 
DOUBTFUL IT WILL WORK 
LAST BUT BY NO MEANS LEAST THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND HAS BEEN SLOWER 
THAN ITS COUNTERPARTS IN THE U. S. AND 
EUROPE TO WILL OFFER FINANCIAL 
SUPPORT TO ITS STRUGGLING 
COMMERCIAL SIBLINGS IT FEARED 
ENCOURAGING FURTHER RISKY LENDING 
BUT HAVING DECIDED TO ACT THE 
CENTRAL BANK IS DOING SO IN A BIG 
WAY TO THE TUNE OF FIFTY BILLION 
AROUND ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN PARLIAMENT 
TODAY THE POLLOCK GOVERNMENT 
OUTLINED THE REASON FOR THE MOVE 
AS BANKS HERE AND ACROSS THE WORLD 
OUTLINED LOSSES THIS WILL HELP 
REBUILD CONFIDENCE THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND CAN TAKE ACTION TO EASE 
CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS 
PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO 
MORTGAGE SECURITIES THE SPECIAL 
SCHEME ANNOUNCED TODAY BY THE BANK 
OF ENGLAND IS A FURTHER STEP 
TOWARDS TACKLING THE PROBLEMS WHICH 
HAVE BECOME MORE EVIDENT IN RECENT 
WEEKS WITH THE INCREASING COST 
DECREASING AVAILABILITY OF LENDING 
BY BANKS AND BUILD SOCIETIES SO SO HOW WILL THE SCHEME WORK BANKS 
WILL BE ALLOWED TO SWAP THEIR 
POTENTIALLY RISKY MORTGAGE BASED 
ASSETS FOR SECURED GOVERNMENT BONDS 
AT THE END OF THREE YEARS MAXIMUM 
THE SWAP WILL BE REVERSED THE IDEA 
IS TO GIVE BANKS A MUCH NEEDED 
BOOST BUT IT IS NOT A BAIL OUT IT 
IS A WAY OF TAKING UNPOPULAR 
INVESTMENTS OF COMMERCIAL BANKS'S 
HANDS FOR A LIMITED PERIOD SO THEY 
ARE FREE TO CARRY ON TRADING 
MASSIVE LOSSES INCURRED BECAUSE OF 
THE U. S. HOUSING MARKET CRISIS HAVE 
MADE BANKS VERY NERVOUS ABOUT 
LENDING TO ANYONE INCLUDING EACH 
OTHER THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS 
HOPING THAT ITS ACTION WILL RENEW 
TRUST IN THE SYSTEM 
THEY ARE NOT 
EXCHANGING CASH OR GETTING ANY 
MONEY BACK WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS 
USING THE GOVERNMENT SECURITIES AS 
COLLATERAL AND GOING INTO THE 
MARKET AND SAYING PLEASE LEND TO 
US AT A BETTER RATE THAN WE COULD 
HAVE GOT BEFORE BECAUSE WE HAVE 
GOT BETTER COLLATERAL 
THE U. S. 
FEDERAL RESERVE HAS LED THE WAY IN 
TERMS OF CASH INJECTIONS JUST LAST 
MONTH IT PUMPED TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS INTO 
FINANCIAL MARKETS BUT THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND HAS BEEN MORE CAUTIOUS AND 
IT HAS IMPOSED STRICT CONDITIONS ON 
ITS NEW OFFER THIS IS THE SPECTRE 
HAUNTING BRITISH FINANCIERS THE 
RUN ON NORTHERN ROCK LAST SEPTEMBER 
NO ONE WANTS TO SEE A REPEAT SO 
WELL TODAY'S MOVE HAVE THE WHIP 
DESIRED EFFECT 
THE AMOUNT THEY ARE 
PUTTING INTO THE MARKETPLACE IS NOT 
SUFFICIENT TO CHANGE THIS MOST 
EFFICIENT SINGLE ENTITY HAS THE 
POWER TO CHANGE THIS ECONOMICALLY 
BUT IF WE CAN CHANGE THE BANK 
INCIDENT WE MAY TURN THIS AROUND 
CRITICS ARGUE THAT CENTRAL BANKS 
PROPPING UP BUSINESSES HAVE MADE 
BAD DECISIONS IS SIMPLY REWARDING 
POOR BEHAVIOUR OTHERS SAY THE 
CREDIT SQUEEZE IS BECOMING A 
STRANGLEHOLD AND SOMETHING HAS TO 
BE DONE SO CENTRAL BANKS ACROSS 
THE WORLD ORAM TO BE NO TO KEEP 
THE FINANCIAL ENGINE RUNNING THEY 
SEEM PREPARED TO POUR IT AWFUL LOT 
OF GREECE ON SOME VERY BIG WHEELS 
WE ARE JOINED NOW FROM WESTMINSTER 
BY JOHN MCFALL LABOUR M. P. AND 
CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE AND FROM 
WASHINGTON BY IRWIN STELZER 
DIRECTOR OF ECONOMIC POLICY STUDIES 
AT THE HUDSON INSTITUTE SHOULD THE 
BRITISH GOVERNMENT BE THROWING 
TAXPAYERS' MONEY AT COMMERCIAL 
BANKS 
HOPEFULLY THEY ARE NOT BANKS THROWING IT AT COMMERCIAL BANKS 
THE QUESTION I ASKED THE CHANCELLOR 
IN THE HOUSE TODAY WHEN HE MADE THE 
STATEMENT WAS DOES HE BELIEVE IN 
MORAL HAZARD THERE IS AN ISSUE 
THAT WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE IN 
MANY WAYS THE BANKS HAVE THE 
COUNTRY IN A CORNER WE ARE FINDING 
THE MARKET IS BECOMING ILL EQUIPPED 
IF NOTHING IS DONE THE MORTGAGE 
MARKET COULD HALF IN THIS COUNTRY 
IN THE NEXT PULLED MONTHS WITH 
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE REAL ECONOMY 
CAN WE PROVIDE A MEASURE WHICH WILL 
HELP LIQUIDITY BRING CONFIDENCE 
BACK TO INDIVIDUAL BANKS TO LEND 
TO EACH OTHER AND INSURE THE 
TAXPAYERS INTEREST THE GOVERNOR OF 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS MADE THE 
POINT TO ME THAT THE MORTGAGES 
ANDY TRIPLE A CREDIT CARDS WHICH 
THEY ARE RECEIVING ON NOT THERE TO 
BAIL OUT THE BAND TO AT ALL ARE 
NOT THERE TO BAIL OUT THE BANKS 
COULD THIS ENCOURAGE RECKLESS 
LENDING IN FUTURE 
I THINK MERVYN 
KING HAS HAD TO BALANCE THIS 
PROBLEM OF TRYING TO HELP THE 
SYSTEM BUT NOT ENCOURAGE BAD GUYS 
TO HAVE MADE STUPID DECISIONS THIS 
IS A PARTIAL STEP HE IS TAKING A 
LITTLE BIT OF THE RISK WITH MORAL 
HAZARD BUT NOT GREAT BECAUSE HE 
IS CHARGING A LOT OF MONEY FOR 
THESE LOANS AND HE IS NOT GIVING 
THEM DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR SO I THINK 
THIS IS A REASONABLE EXPERIMENT TO 
SEE WHETHER THIS CAN EASE UP THE 
SYSTEM THE BETTING IS THAT IT IS 
NOT ENOUGH AND HE WILL COME BACK 
FOR MORE THE OTHER THING IS THAT 
WHEN YOU DO THIS BUT THE 
TAXPAYERS' MONEY AT RISK YOU 
INVITE MORE REGULATION YOU'RE NOT 
GOING TO RESET LEND TO PEOPLE WHO 
WERE GOING TO DO MORE STUPID 
LENDING I THINK THIS IS ALSO THE 
FIRST STEP IN A MUCH TIGHTER 
REGULATION OF THE BANKS THAT CHOOSE 
TO USE THIS FACILITY 
SO THERE IS 
NO GUARANTEE THIS WILL WORK WHEN 
YOU LOOK AT THE AMERICAN AND 
EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANKS WHO HAVE 
PUMPED INTO BILLIONS MUCH EARLIER 
THAN THE BACK OF ENGLAND IT HAS 
NOT MADE THE PROBLEM GO AWAY BUT BUT THERE IS DISCOUNTS SUBSTITUTION 
CLAUSE IS IN THERE AND IF THE 
TAXPAYERS'S INTERESTS ARE PRESERVED 
I AM MUCH HAPPY I AM HAPPY TO 
ENCOURAGE STIMULATION OF THE MARKET 
IF WE SIT BACK AND DO NOTHING 
WE'RE ALL DOOMED WE CANNOT ALLOW 
THAT TO HAPPEN 
WHERE DOES IT STOP 
IF ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IS NOT ENOUGH 
WHERE DO YOU STOP THE TAXPAYER 
KEEPS PICKING UP THE BILL ALASTAIR ALASTAIR DARLING IN HIS STATEMENT TODAY 
MADE THE POINT THAT THE FIFTY BILLION 
HIS INITIAL SO IT COULD BE THAT IT 
WILL INCREASE THE GOVERNMENT AND 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND ARE COMING 
BEFORE THE CLUB SELECT COMMITTEE 
ON TWENTY NINTH APRIL IN A WEEK OR SO WE 
WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WAS 
THESE VERY POINTS AND GO INTO 
DETAIL ASK THESE VERY POINT SO SO THE RISK OF DOING NOTHING IS TOO 
GREAT 
IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE EITHER GREAT GOT A RISK OF TOO MUCH TOO SOON 
OR TOO LITTLE TOO LATE THE LATTER 
RISK IS GREATER WHEN YOU SAY IT 
HASN'T WORKED IN THE U. S. THAT IS 
NOT ENTIRELY TRUE A LOT OF THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH PROBLEM IN THE U. S. IS 
CONTAINED BY WHAT THE FED HAS DONE 
YOU NOTICE BANKS ARE ABLE TO RAISE 
MONEY NOW SO WHY THINK GIVE IT 
TIME I THINK IN BRITAIN YOU 
CAN HAVE A FISCAL STIMULUS LIKE 
YOU HAVE IN THE WEST BECAUSE JOB 
BUDGETARY SITUATION IS IN SUCH BAD 
SHAPE THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS TO 
BEAR THE ENTIRE BURDEN AND I THINK 
IT WILL HAVE TO END UP WITH MORE 
BUT WITH THESE PROTECTIONS IT 
SEEMS TO ME 
THE LESSER OF EVILS IF IF THE IDEA IS THAT BY PUMPING MORE 
LIQUIDITY INTO THE MARKET THAT 
BANKS WILL START LENDING TO ONE 
ANOTHER MORE READILY DOES THAT 
MEAN THAT PRETTY SOON THOSE 
HOMEOWNERS AND POTENTIAL HOME 
BUYERS WHO WERE STRUGGLING I GO TO 
SEE THINGS IMPROVE 
I THINK THINGS 
WILL TIGHTEN UP OVER THE NEXT 
COUPLE OF YEARS THIS ISN'T BACK TO 
THE STATUS QUO BY ANY MEANS BUT AS 
I MENTIONED EARLIER I THINK IF 
NOTHING IS DONE THE ECONOMY COULD 
STRUGGLE THIS IS A STIMULUS THERE 
ARE TOUGH TIMES OVER THE NEXT YEAR 
OR TWO ECONOMICALLY WE CANNOT GET 
AWAY FROM THAT IT WOULD BE SILLY 
FOR US TO THINK THAT THIS WOULD 
TAKE AWAY ALL OUR PROBLEMS THE THE THING THAT MOVES BY THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND ARE GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO 
STAVE OFF FURTHER ECONOMIC 
SLOWDOWN 
THAT IS HARD TO TELL SLOWDOWN BEFORE WE START WEEPING FOR 
HOMEOWNERS REMEMBER YOU HAVE HAD 
ABOUT A FIFTEEN PER CENT DECLINE IN 
PRICES AFTER A TWO HUNDRED PER CENT RUN UP 
SO I WOULD NOT WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT 
THAT I THINK THE BRITISH ECONOMY 
MIGHT TAKE A SMALL HIT BUT I DO 
NOT THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A 
MAJOR CRISIS THAT IS GOING TO BE 
FOR YOU I WOULD CHEER UP THANK THANK YOU YOU THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS AGAIN 
WADED INTO THE CRISIS IN BY 
ZIMBABWE FOLLOWING LAST CLUB'S 
ELECTIONS DAVID MILIBAND HAS 
ACCUSED PRESIDENT MUGABE OF 
BEATING HIS OWN PEOPLE TO DEATH 
MR. MILIBAND ALSO SAID NO ONE COULD 
HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE RECOUNTING 
OF THE VOTES NOW UNDER WAY HIS 
COMMENTS ABOUT VIOLENCE IN ZIMBABWE 
ARE SUPPORTED BY HUMAN RIGHTS 
ACTIVISTS AS NOW VICTIMS OF 
REPORTED ATTACKS CAN BE SEEN IN 
GRAPHIC PICTURES OBTAINED BY THE 
B. B. C. 
THE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE AND 
BEATINGS IN ZIMBABWE THAT ZANU P. F. 
SAY ARE NOT HAPPENING THESE MEN 
WERE CLUB AND SMASHED FOR BOATING 
THE WRONG WAY THE OPPOSITION 
CLAIMS THEY ARE TARGET OF A 
SYSTEMATIC PROGRAMME OF BRUTALITY 
TEN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE 
THE DISPUTED ELECTION AND HUNDREDS 
BUT IN HOSPITAL HUMAN RIGHTS 
GROUPS NOW HAVE EVIDENCE OF TORTURE 
CAMPS 
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ADDED CAMPS BUYING OUR CAMPS SET UP BY ZANU P. F. 
MILITIA AND OTHERS TO PUNISH 
PEOPLE FOR HAVING VOTED FOR THE 
OPPOSITION PARTY PEOPLE ARE TAKEN 
THERE AT NIGHT HELD FOR HOURS 
BEATEN WITH WOODEN PLANKS AND OTHER 
WOODEN BATONS AND LEFT ON THE SIDE 
OF THE ROAD 
THE ZIMBABWEAN 
GOVERNMENT SAYS EXAGGERATED CLAIMS 
OF VIOLENCE ARE BEING USED BY THE 
OPPOSITION TO STIR UP THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND GET IT 
TO INTERVENE I SPOKE TO A MENTION 
OF ROBERT MUGABE'S GOVERNMENT ON 
THE TELEPHONE 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE 
THIS IS COMING FROM IT IS 
DIFFICULT YES THERE MADE THE 
CLASHES BUT THINGS ARE QUITE 
PEACEFUL THERE MAY BE CLASHES 
THAT IS NOT THE IMPRESSION YOU GET 
IF YOU SPEAK TO THE M. D. C. THEY HAVE 
DESCRIBED THE SITUATION IN THE 
COUNTRY AS A STATE OF WAR 
IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING 
HONESTLY THINGS ARE QUITE NORMAL 
THEY ARE NOT NORMAL THE PEOPLE OF 
ZIMBABWE ARE STILL NO CLOSER TO 
FINDING OUT WHO WON THE VOTE MORE 
THAN THREE WEEKS AGO THEY STRONGLY 
WORDED STATEMENT DAVID MILIBAND 
THE FOREIGN SECRETARY DESCRIBED AS 
AN ATTEMPT TO STEAL THE ELECTION 
THE PARTIAL RECOUNT GOING ON NOW 
INCLUDE THE THREE SEATS IS A 
CHARADE OF DEMOCRACY 
NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF 
THE DAY'S OTHER NEWS THE FORMER 
AMERICAN PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER HAS 
SPENT THE WEEKEND IN TALKS WITH 
HAMAS AND SAID IT BUS BE INVOLVED 
IN THE PEACE PROCESS IF IT IS TO 
SUCCEED HAMAS IS SEEN AS A TERROR 
ORGANISATION BY ISRAEL THE WEST 
AND THE E. U. MR. CARTER CALLED ON THE 
E. U. AND ISRAEL TO SPEAK TO THEM 
DURING HIS EIGHT DAY VISIT TO THE 
MIDDLE EAST JIMMY CARTER MET 
REGIONAL HEADS OF STATE AND 
CONTROVERSIALLY LEADERS OF HAMAS 
HE SAYS THERE CANNOT BE PEACE 
UNLESS ALL MAJOR PLAYERS ARE 
INVOLVED HOWEVER UNPALATABLE THAT 
MAY SEEM TO SUM 
THE PRESENT 
STRATEGY OF EXCLUDING HAMAS AND 
EXCLUDING SYRIA IS JUST NOT 
WORKING IT ONLY EXACERBATES THE 
CYCLE OF VIOLENCE AND 
MISUNDERSTANDING 
THE MAN WHO MISUNDERSTANDING BROKERED THE FIRST ARAB ISRAELI 
PEACE DEAL IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES SAYS HE 
IS NOW RECEIVING ASSURANCES FROM 
HAMAS 
THEY SAY THAT THEY WOULD HAMAS ACCEPT A PALESTINIAN STATE ON A 
NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN BORDERS IF APPROVED BY 
PALESTINIANS AND THEY WOULD ACCEPT 
THE RIGHT OF ISRAEL TO LIVE AS A 
NEIGHBOUR NEXT DOOR IN PEACE IN IN DAMASCUS THE EXILED LEADER OF 
HAMAS SAYS THAT HE DID NOT MEAN HE 
HAD EXPLICITLY RECOGNISED ISRAEL 
BUT HE DID OFFER OTHER CONCESSIONS 
IF ISRAEL GAVE UP THE LAND CAPTURED 
OVER FORTY YEARS AGO 
WE 
HAVE OFFERED A TEN YEAR TRUCE 
AFTER HIS REAL MADRID TO THE 
BORDERS OF JUNE NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN AS AN 
ALTERNATIVE TO THE RECOGNITION 
THIS IS THE CLEAR VISION OF HAMAS 
EVEN AS HE SAID THAT PALESTINIAN 
MILITANTS FIRED ROCKETS AT LIKE 
THESE FROM GAZA INTO ISRAEL 
INJURING A FOUR YEAR OLD BOY TO 
MOST ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS 
PEACE STILL SEEMS A VERY DISTANT 
PROSPECT 
GEORGIA AND RUSSIA HAVE BEEN 
ATTACKING EACH OTHER OVER AN 
INCIDENT AT THE WEEKEND WHEN 
GEORGIA SAYS A RUSSIAN AIR FORCE 
JET SHOT DOWN AN UNMANNED GEORGIAN 
RECONNAISSANCE PLANE OVER ITS 
TERRITORY THE GEORGIAN PRESIDENT 
PHONED PRESENT BEGIN TO COMPLAIN 
BUT HE TOLD IN THE UNMANNED FLIGHTS 
ARE A DESTABILISING FACTOR RUSSIA 
DENIES ITS AIR FORCE DOWNED THE 
DRONE DRONE THE SPANISH NAVY IS SENDING A 
FRIGATE TO WATERS OFF SOMALI AFTER 
A SPANISH FISHING BOAT WAS SEIZED 
BY PIRATES TWENTY SIX CREW ON BOARD HALF 
OF THEM SPANISH NATIONALS THE REST 
THOUGHT TO BE AFRICA'S A COUPLE OF 
WEEKS AGO THE CREW OF A FRENCH 
YACHT WERE TAKEN HOSTAGE IN THE 
SAME AREA 
SIX DECADES OF ONE PARTY RULE HAVE 
COME TO AN END IN PARAGUAY AFTER A 
FORMER BISHOP WON THE PARTY'S 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION HE TOLD 
JUBILANT SUPPORTERS THAT THE RESULT 
SHOWED THE LITTLE PEOPLE COULD WIN 
PARAGUAY IS THE LATEST SOUTH 
AMERICAN COUNTRY TO SWING TO THE 
LEFT LEFT THE RACE TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT 
OF UNITED STATES IS PROVING TO BE 
ONE OF THE TOUGHEST CONTESTS EVER 
FOR THE DEMOCRATIC CONTENDERS 
HILLARY CLINTON AND BARACK OBAMA 
WERE CAMPAIGNING AGAIN TODAY IN THE 
STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA AHEAD OF 
TOMORROW'S KEY PRIMARY MRS. CLINTON 
IS HOPING THAT VICTORY DAM MACRO 
WILL RE ENERGISE HER BID FOR THE 
WHITE HOUSE WHAT IS BEYOND DOUBT 
IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE EIGHT HUNDRED 
DEMOCRATS KNOWN AS THE SUPER 
DELEGATES AND THE ROLE THEY WILL 
PLAY IN DECIDING THE EVENTUAL 
SUCCESS IN SUCH A TIGHT RACE THE 
SUPER DELEGATES MAY INCLUDE SUCH 
SENIOR POLITICAL HEAVYWEIGHTS AS 
BILL CLINTON AND AL GORE BUT IN 
FACT MANY ARE ORDINARY DEMOCRAT 
ACTIVISTS NORTH AMERICA EDITOR 
JUSTIN WEBB HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO 
SOME OF THEM ABOUT THE CONTEST 
A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD STUDENT ON MILWAUKEE 
WISCONSIN A RENOWNED EYE DOCTOR IN 
SHYING WYOMING AND A MEXICAN 
RESTAURANT OWNER IN EDWARDS 
COLORADO ALL OF THEM THE SUPER 
DELEGATES AT THIS UNIVERSITY IN 
MILWAUKEE POLITICS AS WELL TELL 
YOU THAT THE EIGHT HUNDRED SUPER DELEGATES 
ARE MOSTLY PARTY BIGWIGS 
POLITICS DOLLARS 
HELLO HOW YOU 
IT IS GOOD TO SEE INSIDE THE HOME 
OF A SUPER DELEGATES 
NOTHING TO 
SPECIAL 
IS JASON A BIGWIG NOT SPECIAL REALLY BUT HE IS AN ACTIVIST AND A 
SUPER DELEGATES THE CANDIDATES AND 
THEIR BACKERS ARE DESPERATE FOR HIS 
SUPPORT 
I HAVE TAUGHT TO CHELSEA SUPPORT CLINTON AND HILLARY CLINTON HERSELF 
PRESIDENT CLINTON RANG YOU 
IT WAS 
A FRIDAY NIGHT I WAS SITTING IN MY 
ROOM GETTING READY TO GO TO DINNER 
AND I'LL ANSWER THE PHONE JASON 
PLEASE HOLD FOR THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT I THOUGHT SOMEONE WAS 
STARTING THE FRIDAY NIGHT 
FESTIVITIES TOO EARLY ON THE OTHER 
END PRESIDENT CLINTON WAS SAYING 
JASON BILLY HERE HOW ARE YOU I 
AM SURE IT WAS HIM THE VOICE IS 
DISTINGUISHED 
NEVER MIND THE PHONE DISTINGUISHED CALLS JASON GETS FACE TIME IN A 
RACE THIS TIME AS THIS THE 
CANDIDATES HAVE TO SWALLOW THEIR 
PRIDE AND GRIP AND GOING WITH 
SUPER DELEGATES AS IF THEIR LIVES 
DEPEND ON IT BUT IS THIS ALL FAIR 
ACROSS AMERICA IN WYOMING THE 
HOTHOUSE ATMOSPHERE OF WASHINGTON 
POLITICS IS A MILLION MILES AWAY 
LIFE HERE IS LOW AND PEOPLE ARE 
PLENTY OF TIME TO THINK HARD ABOUT 
POLITICS AND ABOUT JUSTICE AND TO 
MANY LOCAL DEMOCRATS THE SUPER 
DELEGATES SYSTEM DOES NOT PASS THE 
TEST IN A SURGERY IN CHEYENNE 
JOHN MILLER IS USING SKILL AND 
JUDGMENT AND STEADINESS OF HAND TO 
IMPROVE THE SITE OF HIS PATIENTS 
BUT HIS SUPER DELEGATES SKILLS 
SHOULD HE SAYS BE LIMITED TO 
BACKING THE VOICE OF THE VOTERS HE 
WANTS THE CANDIDATE WITH THE BIGGER 
NUMBER OF VOTES TO BE THE WINNER 
THE SUPER DELEGATES MUST NOT 
OVERRULE THE PEOPLE 
I THINK IT 
WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR THE PARTY 
AND THE COUNTRY QUITE FRANKLY IF 
A SMALL GROUP OF EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE 
OVERTURNED THE DECISION MADE BY THE 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE TURNED 
OUT TO VOTE 
FAMOUS CHICKEN 
ENCHILADAS 
THAT IS THE VIEW IN ENCHILADAS THIS MEXICAN RESTAURANT IN COLORADO 
WHERE DEBBIE IS A SUPER DELEGATES 
SHE IS TROUBLED BY THE IDEA THAT 
SHE MIGHT OVERRULE THE DEMOCRATIC 
COLLECTORS MOST DEMOCRATS HAVE 
VOTED FOR BARACK OBAMA EVEN AFTER 
PENNSYLVANIA AND THE OTHERS THAT 
WILL PROBABLY BE THE CASE AND 
DEBBIE WILL ON OTHER CHOICE 
IT WAS 
VERY INTERESTING TO TELL THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT WHOM I ADMIRE THAT I 
WOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING SENATOR 
CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT IT WAS 
DIFFICULT 
BACK AT THE UNIVERSITY DIFFICULT JASON IS HAVING LUNCH WITH HIS 
FRIENDS AND REVELLING IN HIS 
CELEBRITY STATUS MAKE YOUR 
ANNOUNCEMENT THEY WERE YOU GOING 
TO BACK 
I AM BACKING SENATOR 
BARACK OBAMA 
OUTSIDE CLASSES ARE 
ENDING AND THE MASSES ON THE MARCH 
JASON IS MARCHING WITH THEM AND IT 
IS LIKELY THAT MOST OF THE 
DELEGATES WILL DO THE SAME IF MRS. 
CLINTON DOES NOT WIN THE MOST VOTES 
IN THE PRIMARIES IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO SEE THE SUPER DELEGATES RESCUING 
HER HER NOW ONLY A FRACTION OF AFRICANS 
HAVE REGULAR UNINTERRUPTED SUPPLIES 
OF ELECTRICITY AND POWER IS VITAL 
FOR ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS 
DEVELOPMENT TODAY A PLAN TO BUILD 
THE WORLD'S LARGEST AND MOST 
POWERFUL HYDRO ELECTRIC DAM IN 
AFRICA IS BEING DISCUSSED IN LONDON 
REPRESENTATIVES FROM SEVEN AFRICAN 
GOVERNMENTS AND THE WORLD'S LARGEST 
BANKS AND CONSTRUCTION FIRMS ARE 
MEETING TO CONSIDER THE GRAND INGA 
PROJECT IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 
OF CONGO THE EIGHTY BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT 
WERE DOWN THE CONGO RIVER AND BRING 
ELECTRICITY TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE 
ACROSS THE CONTINENT 
THIS IS THE THREE GORGES DAM ON 
CHINA'S YANGTZE RIVER GENERALLY 
CONSIDERED TO BE THE LARGEST HYDRO 
ELECTRIC DAM IN THE WORLD NOW 
THERE IS A PLAN TO BUILD SOMETHING 
THAT WOULD ALL FIT AND GENERATES 
TWICE AS MUCH ELECTRICITY THE DAM 
WOULD BE BUILT HERE IN THE 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO 
DAMNING THE CONGO RIVER AFRICA'S 
SECOND LONGEST AFTER THE NILE THE 
PLAN WAS CONCEIVED IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES BUT 
ONLY RESULTED IN TWO SMALL DAMS 
BEING BUILT WHICH FELL INTO 
DISREPAIR DURING THE CIVIL WAR IN 
THE NINETEEN NINETIES GRAND INGA'S SUPPORTERS 
SAY THAT AS A CARBON NEUTRAL SOURCE 
OF ENERGY THE PROJECT COULD JUMP 
START INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT IN 
AFRICA BUT CRITICS SAY THE PROJECT 
DUE FOR COMPLETION IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO WOULD 
HAVE SERIOUS ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL 
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE REGION THE 
RIVER IS A TRADE AND TRANSPORT 
LIFELINE FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 
AND OPPONENTS SAY THE PROJECT WOULD 
FORCE THOUSANDS FROM THEIR HOMES 
THE SCHEME WOULD CERTAINLY BENEFIT 
INDUSTRIAL POWER HOUSES LIKE SOUTH 
AFRICA WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN 
ELECTRICITY SHORTAGES BUT CRITICS 
INSIST MOST PEOPLE WILL NOT BE 
BETTER OFF THEY SAY THE PROJECT'S 
MASSIVE BUDGET WOULD BE A MAGNET 
FOR CORRUPTION AND COULD LEAVE THE 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO WITH 
HUGE DEBTS I AM JOINED BY THE HEAD 
OF THE BUS ONE A BASED UTILITY 
COMPANY THAT WILL DEVELOP MAINTAIN 
AND OPERATE THE PROJECT BART'S 
ONE HE HAS BROKEN AWAY FROM THE 
DISCUSSIONS TO TALK TO US NOW WILL 
THIS PROJECT GET OFF THE GROUND WE 
CAN UNDERSTAND THE SCEPTICISM WE WE HAVE COME TOGETHER AS PART OF THE 
JOINT VENTURE GROUP COMPRISING THE 
FIVE STATES UTILITIES TO DEVELOP 
THE PROJECT WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE 
GOING TO MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL 
CONTRIBUTION ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION 
TO THE REGION ITSELF 
BUT YOU KNOW 
WHAT PEOPLE SAY THIS MAY BENEFIT 
BUSINESS AND THE WEALTHY URBAN 
ELITE BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE 
IN THE RURAL AREAS 
CERTAINLY THE 
CHALLENGE FOR US IS TO REACH OUT 
AND BRING TO OUR PEOPLE A BETTER 
QUALITY OF LIFE AND IN SO DOING WE 
ARE GOING TO DEVELOP THE PROJECT 
WE ARE GOING TO DEVELOP THE 
INDUSTRIES TO SUPPORT THE PROJECT 
AND CREATE JOBS WE ARE GOING TO 
BRING ABOUT GREATER LEARNING IN 
TERMS OF HOW WE HANDLE THE 
ENVIRONMENT THE AREA WE'RE WORKING 
IN HIS EXTREMELY FRAGILE AND WE 
CERTAINLY DON'T MAKE END OF THE 
BAND CREATIVE ENGINEERING DESIGNS 
TO TAP THE ENERGY FROM THE RIVER 
WE'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO MAKE 
INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE ENERGY 
DESIGNS 
ONLY ONE PER CENT OF RURAL PEOPLE DESIGNS HAVE ACCESS TO POWER 
THAT IS THE 
CHALLENGE BACK IN AFRICA 
THAT IS A 
MASSIVE CHALLENGE 
THAT IS NOT JUST 
IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO 
BUT RURAL AFRICA WE HAVE GOT TO 
BRING POWER TO THE PEOPLE THAT IS 
THE FIRST PART OF OUR AGENDA THE 
PRIORITY IS TO DEVELOP THE PLANT 
AND IMMEDIATELY SUPPLY THE NEEDS OF 
THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO 
WE WOULD ONLY GO ACROSS THE BORDER 
WITH THE TRANSMISSION CIRCUITS ONCE 
WE HAVE MADE A SUBSTANTIAL 
CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECONOMY OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO THE 
SO YOU DO NOT HAVE THE DISTRIBUTION 
LINES AND PANS AND PLACED TO 
INCREASE CONNECTIONS WITH THE 
ELECTRICITY GRID THAT WOULD NEED 
TO BE CREATED 
THAT IS A HUGE GAP 
OH IT IS WE WILL BE BUILDING THE 
NATIONAL GRID FOR THE DEMOCRATIC 
REPUBLIC OF CONGO FOLLOWED BY 
ANGOLA NAMIBIA THEN BOTS ONE AND 
LASTLY ON TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN 
NATIONAL GRID WHICH IS WELL 
ESTABLISHED 
WHAT ABOUT ESTABLISHED DISPLACEMENT WHENEVER YOU BUILD 
THESE BIG DAMS 
WE ARE EXTREMELY 
FORTUNATE AT THE INGA RIVERSIDE'S 
THAT THERE ARE NO INHABITANTS WE 
ARE DEALING WITH MOTHER NATURE IN 
ITS NATURAL FORM IT IS AN ISOLATED 
AREA IT IS NATURALLY PREPARED TO 
RECEIVE THE SORT OF CREATIVE 
ENGINEERING NO MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE 
AS YOU HAVE SAID IT IS AN EIGHTY DOLLAR 
BILLION PROJECT THAT IS A HUGE SUM 
OF MONEY ARE WE GOING TO HAVE 
ACCOUNTABILITY 
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY CREATED THIS INDEPENDENT COMPANY 
THAT HAS GOT EXTERNAL AUDITORS 
THAT WE HAVE GOT EXTERNAL COMPANY 
SECRETARY TO MANAGE GOVERNORS AND 
WE HAVE GOT EXTREMELY HIGH 
VISIBILITY FROM THE LEADERSHIP OF 
THE COMPANY AND THE AFRICAN UNION 
AND FOLLOWED BY THE LEADERSHIP OF 
THE INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPATING 
COUNTRIES 
YOU OFTEN GET AN COUNTRIES OVERSPEND WITH BIG PROJECTS LIKE 
THIS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE THE 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO 
SADDLED WITH THAT 
THE PROJECT IS 
GOING TO REBUILD A MODULAR FACES 
ALTHOUGH IT IS EIGHTY BILLION IN 
TOTALITY IT WILL BE IN SMALL 
CHUNKS THAT WE WILL BE EXPLORING AS 
WE PROGRESS THROUGH THE PROJECT 
THUS FAR WE HAVE CONTRIBUTED 
EQUALLY IN TERMS OF EQUITY AND WE 
HAVE KEPT EXPENDITURES DOWN FOR AN 
ABSOLUTE MINIMUM KNOWING FULL WELL 
THAT OUR OBLIGATIONS ARE MORE TO 
BRING ABOUT A BETTER QUALITY OF 
LIFE TO THE PEOPLE 
PLANS ARE THE 
PAST HAVE BEEN BESET BY THE 
VIOLENCE THAT RAGES IN THE D. R. C. BY 
A CONFIDENT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO 
HAVE THAT STABILITY 
THE D. R. C. IS 
EXTREMELY STABLE AT THE MOMENT WE 
DO KNOW WHAT AREAS OF ISOLATED 
INCIDENTS BUT IN GENERAL EXTREMELY 
STABLE WE FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE 
WORKING THERE EVER GOING TO BE
