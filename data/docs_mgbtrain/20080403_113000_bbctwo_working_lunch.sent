GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO 
THURSDAY'S WORKING HUNDRED DON'T 
HOLD YOUR BREATH IT WILL GET WORSE 
BEFORE IT GETS BETTER THE COST OF 
GETTING A MORTGAGE COULD GO UP EVEN 
MORE ALSO TODAY ONE WORKING LUNCH 
VIEWER TELLS US WHAT HAPPENS AFTER 
YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH A I. V. A. TO GET 
OUT OF THE DEBT TRAP MOTHERCARE 
DOES WELL ON LINE COMING UP TOO 
A BUM NOTE FOR BUILDERS AS A BAN ON 
WHISTLING IS IN SIGHT HALF THE 
FLOWERS BOUGHT IN THE U. K. WERE GROWN 
HERE TODAY IT IS JUST ONE IN TEN 
THE FLOWER GROWING INDUSTRY IS IN 
DECLINE THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS 
WARNED THAT A SHORTAGE OF MORTGAGES 
IS GOING TO GET WORSE IN THE COMING 
MONTHS THAT IS ACCORDING TO THEIR 
QUARTERLY CREDIT SURVEY THAT WILL 
HAPPEN JUST AS THE COST OF 
MORTGAGES IS GOING TO RISE THEY 
SAY AND GIVEN THAT SQUEEZE WELL I 
SUPPOSE IT IS NOT SURPRISING THE 
BANK EXPECTS MORE PEOPLE NOT TO PAY 
BACK SOME OF THEIR LOANS THAT IS 
REALLY ONE OF THE MOST WORRYING 
THING ABOUT THIS WARNING IT IS 
THOUGHT MORE LIKELY THAT THE BANK 
WILL CUT INTEREST RATES IN AN 
EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION IT 
IS NOT JUST MORTGAGES THAT ARE 
FACING PROBLEMS THE BANK ALSO 
CLAIMED THAT LENDERS REPORTED 
DEFAULT RATES FOR MEDIUM SIZED 
THIS IS NOT THE BANKS ORDINARY 
COMPANIES THE FACT THEY ARE 
DEFAULTING ON LOANS PICKED UP MORE 
SHARPLY THAN EXPECTED OVER THE LAST 
THREE MONTHS DEFAULT RATES ARE 
EXPECTED TO INCREASE OVER THE NEXT 
THREE MONTHS AS WELL 
SO LET'S LOOK AT HOW DIFFICULT IT 
IS TO GET A MORTGAGE GILLIAN IS 
WITH US WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT 
WHO IS HAPPENING PROBLEMS 
IT COULD 
BE ANYBODY WANTING A MORTGAGE SO 
THERE ARE FOURTEEN MILLION PEOPLE COMING 
OFF FIXED RATE MORTGAGES BETWEEN 
FOUR PER CENT MINUS FIVE PER CENT SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE 
GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS THEN WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT NEW BUYERS TO THE 
MARKET AND A CATEGORY WHICH 
ACROSS BOTH OF THOSE THOSE WHO 
HAVE HAD ADVERSE CREDIT THEY WILL 
BE IN TROUBLE EVERYONE TALKS IN 
THESE BIG BROAD GENERAL TERMS L. 
GET THE SENSE THERE IS IS A PANIC 
OUT THERE YOU SWITCH ON THE RADIO 
OR THE TELEVISION OR READ A 
NEWSPAPER YOU THINK I'M NOT 
GOING TO GET A MORTGAGE WHAT I 
HAVE TRIED TO DO IS BE MORE 
SPECIFIC AND SEE WHO IT MIGHT 
REALLY BE OUT OF THOSE PEOPLE 
COMING OFF A FIXED RATE MORTGAGE 
THERE IS FOURTEEN MILLION OF THOSE ARE 
THEY LIKELY TO BE THROWN OFF THEIR 
MORTGAGE BY THEIR MORTGAGE LENDER 
SAY YOU'VE HAD A TWO YEAR FIXED 
RATE MORTGAGE OR A FIVE YEAR FIXED 
RATE MORTGAGE L. ASKED A MORTGAGE 
BROKER AS YOU COME TO THE END OF 
THAT PERIOD IF YOUR LENDER NO 
LONGER LIKES THE LOOK OF YOU CAN 
THEY SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH I AM 
GETTING RID OF YOU REALISTICLY REALISTICLY THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN FIFTEEN 
YEARS OR SO I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT HAPPEN IT 
IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT YOUR 
CONTRACT I. E. THE MORTGAGE OFFER IS 
ACTUALLY FOR A SET TERM IT IS NOT 
JUST SET FOR THE FIXED RATE PERIOD 
OR THE INITIAL DISCOUNTED RATE 
PERIOD OF SAY TWO OR FIVE YEARS 
TRADITIONALLY SPEAKING THAT IS 
AROUND TWENTY FIVE YEARS SO YOU KNOW THAT 
IF YOU MAKE YOUR MONTHLY REPAYMENTS 
ON A REPAYMENT MORTGAGE EVERY MONTH 
FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS THEN YOUR MORTGAGE 
WILL BE PAID OFF SO NO AFTER TWO 
OR FIVE YEARS OR WHATEVER FIXED 
RATE YOU WILL NOT BE THROWN OFF 
FROM THAT 
YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY 
DRILLED DOWN INTO THE DETAIL GIVE 
US THAT DETAIL ON WHO WILL STRUGGLE 
WELL IF WE BUILD UP THE PROFILE OF 
THE SORT OF PERSON WHO WILL 
STRUGGLE THERE ARE THREE THINGS 
THAT PERSON MIGHT HAVE FIRST THING 
IS LITTLE DEPOSIT THE BANKS DONTS 
LIKE YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH OF 
A DEPOSIT BEFORE IT WAS NOT 
PROBLEM ONE HUNDRED PER CENT MORTGAGES ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PER CENT 
MORTGAGES WERE FINE THE SECOND 
THING IS IF YOU HAVE AN INCOME 
STRETCH YOU WANT TOO MUCH INCOME 
SAY FIVE TIMES YOUR INCOME 
ANYTHING MORE THAN FOUR TIMES YOUR 
INCOME THEY DON'T LIKE AND THE 
ADVERSE CREDIT THAT IS A REAL NO 
NO IN TODAY'S MARKET THAT CAN MEAN 
ANYTHING FROM MISSS A CREDIT CARD 
PAYMENT TO MORTGAGE PAYMENT 
THOSE ARE THE GENERALITYS IN TERMS 
OF SPECIFICS WE SAID O. K. TAKE THOSE 
THREE GENERALITYS AND LOOK AT THE 
SPECIFICS A PERSON WITH NINETY FIVE PER CENT LOAN 
TO VALUE THEY ONLY HAVE A FIVE PER CENT 
DEPOSIT LET'S SAY THEY WANT FIVE 
TIMES THEIR 
TIMES THEIR 
INCOME SAY THEY WANT 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MORTGAGE LET'S SAY ON THE 
ADVERSE CREDIT THEY'VE MISSED ONE 
MORTGAGE PAYMENT IN THE LAST TWO 
YEARS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THAT 
PERSON THESE ARE THE THREE 
CRITERIA IS ANYONE GOING TO LOAN 
TO THEM WE SPOKE TO THREE MORTGAGE 
BROKERS THEY TOLD US DIFFERENT 
THINGS WHICH IS THE POINT WE MAKE 
ONE SAID THEY THOUGHT YOU COULD GET 
EIGHT PER CENT POSSIBLY WHICH IS A PRETTY 
UNATTRACTIVE RATE ANOTHER ONE SAID 
THAT YOU COULD GET NOTHING CHASE 
DEVEER THOUGHT WITH THOSE CRITERIA 
YOU WILL NOT GET MORTGAGEMENT 
THEN WE SPOKE TO LONDON AND COUNTRY 
THEY SAID IT DEPENDS ON THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES IF YOU WILL BE 
FAVOURABLE YOU COULD GET HERE WHAT 
MIGHT BE POSSIBLE IS A SIXTY SIX PER CENT THE 
BEST RATE THEY COULD FIND TWO YEAR 
FIX WHICH IS FAIRLY UNATTRACTIVE 
LET'S COMPARE IT TO WHAT YOU WOULD 
HAVE GOT SIX MONTHS AGO THAT IS 
FIVE P. I. FIVE PER CENT YOU CAN SEE THAT IF IT IS 
THAT TIGHT ONE HUNDRED BETWEEN LAST YOR'S 
RATE AND THIS YEAR'S RATE THEN YOU 
SHOULD NOT GO FOR MORTGAGE ANY 
WAY YOU CANNOT AFFORD THAT 
DIFFERENTIAL IT IS TRUE THINGS 
ARE TOUGH OUT THERE BUT IT IS NOT 
TRUE THERE IS NOTHING OUT THERE AT 
ALL 
THE SITUATION FOR PEOPLE APPLYING 
FOR MORTGAGES IS GETTING TOUGHER 
TOUGHER THOUGH IF YOU HAVE 
PREVIOUSLY GOT INTO TROUBLE OVER 
DEBT SIMON WENT TO SEE VIEWER 
WHO AGREED TO AN IDIVIDUAL 
VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT IN ORDER TO 
DEAL WITH HER DEBTS NOW THAT IS 
COMING TO AN END SHE WOULD LIKE TO 
BECOME A HOME OWNER 
I WAS IN DIRE 
STRAITS I WAS UNABLE TO PAY MY 
BILLS 
STEVE WATKINS GOT INTO BILLS DEBT JUGLING HER SPENDING OVER TEN 
CREDIT CARDS AND TAKING OUT LOANS 
SHE HAD TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK 
BECAUSE OF AN ILLNESS THAT IS WHEN 
SHE SOUGHT REFUGE IN AN I. V. A. AN 
ALTERNATIVE TO GOING BANKRUPT 
HOW DID THINGS GET SO 
BAD 
STUPIDITY RATHER THAN SAVING BAD FOR AN ITEM I WOULD GO OUT AND PAY 
FOR IT ON MY CREDIT CARD IT WAS 
NEVER PAID OFF IT MOUNTED AND 
MOUNTED THEN I STARTED TO HAVE 
PROBLEMS PAYING L. GOT LATE PAYMENT 
CHARGES ONCE YOU GET INTO THAT 
SPIRAL IT IS A ONE WAY STREET 
THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH YOU 
COULD HAVE TRIED TO DEAL WITH THE 
DEBT WHY DID YOU CHOSE THE 
IDIVIDUAL VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT 
THE I. V. A. ACTUALLY MEANS IT WILL NOT 
AFFECT ME CAREER WISE L. WAS 
QUALIFIED AND QUALIFIED AS A LEGAL 
SECRETARY IF I WAS MADE BANKRUPT 
IT COULD AFFECT MY CAREER CHOICES 
IN THE FUTURE 
AN IDIVIDUAL 
VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT IS A LEGAL 
ARRANGEMENT WITH AT 
LEAST THREE 
ARRANGEMENT WITH AT LEAST THREE QUARTERS OF YOUR CREDITORS TO REPAY 
ALL OR PART OF YOUR DEBT THERE IS 
A HEFTY FEE TO BE PAID THE I. V. A. 
LASTS FIVE YEARS OF MONTHLY 
PAYMENTS SHARON COMES OUT OF HER'S 
THIS MONTH THEN YOU ARE FREE OF 
ALL THE DEBTS THE STAIN REMAINS ON 
YOUR CREDIT RECORD FOR SIX YEARS 
SO ANOTHER YEAR AFTER THE I. V. A. ENDS 
EIGHT THE POINT OF THE IDIVIDUAL 
VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT IS TO PROVIDE 
AN ESCAPE ROUTE FROM THE DEBT TRAP 
THEN IN THEORY THINGS GET BACK TO 
NORMAL 
IN THEORY THOUGH THE WORRY FOR 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH AN I. V. A. 
IS TO WHAT EXTENT THEIR FUTURE 
FINANCES WILL BE AFFECTED WHAT 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO 
I WOULD LIKE 
TO GET A SMALL RAINY DAY FUND A 
FEW HUNDRED OR ONE THOUSAND IN THE BANK 
FOR AN EMERGENCY IN THE LONG TERM 
I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT GETTING A 
MORTGAGE 
THAT IS A QUESTION AS TO MORTGAGE WHAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO GET WHAT WHAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO GET AT THE 
MOMENT WHETHER I HAVE A CHANCE OF 
PART PURCHASING MY HOUSE ON THE 
HOUSING ASSOCIATION WHAT WOULD MY 
MORTGAGE RESTRICTIONS BE IF I WAS 
BUYING FIFTY PER CENT OF MY PROPERTY 
WE INTRODUCED SHARON TO MORTGAGE 
EXPERT RAY BOULGER TO FIND OUT 
WHAT HER MORTGAGE PROSPECTS MIGHT 
BE 
IF YOU WAIT TWO AND A HALF BE YEARS IF YOU KEEP YOUR NOSE CLEAN 
OVER THAT PERIOD 
HE SAID THE 
STARTING RATE WOULD BE A TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
DEPOSIT BECAUSE SHE IS SUB PRIME 
OR HIGH RISK WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA 
OF SHARED OWNERSHIP 
THAT IS 
DIFFICULT FOR SUB PRIME THE VAST 
MAJORITY WILL NOT LEND ON A SHARED 
OWNERSHIP BASIS BEARING IN MIND 
SHARON RECOGNISES SHE CANNOT BUY 
IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT 
HAVE ANY SAVINGS AND SHE PLANS TO 
WAIT TWO TWO AND A HALF YEARS 
THEN SHE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO BUY THE HOUSING ASSOCIATION 
PROPERTY SHE IS IN AT A GOOD 
DISCOUNT AT THAT STAGE PROVIDING 
SHE GETS NO ADVERSE CREDIT OVER THE 
NEXT TWO YEARS BEARING IN MIND SHE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT OF THE I. V. A. FOR 
TWO YEARS HAD A CHANCE TO SAVE I 
THINK AT THAP STAGE PROVIDING THE 
MARKET CONDITIONS ARE NO WORSE THAN 
THEY ARE TODAY SHE SHOULD BE ABLE 
TO GET A MORTGAGE SHARON'S SHARON'S ATTITUDE TO DEBT HAS COMPLETELY 
CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THE TRAUMA 
OF HAVING TO GO THROUGH AN I. V. A. NOW 
SHE WANTS TO AVOID CREDIT CARDS ALL 
TOGETHER AND SPEND MONEY ONLY WHEN 
SHE HAS SAVED IT FIRST 
OBVIOUSLY THAT IS GENERALLY GOOD 
ADVICE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHAT 
CAN SHE AND THOUSANDS LIKE HER DO 
CONCRETELY TO MAKE HER MORE CREDIT 
WORTHY 
NOT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT WORTHY YOU HEARD WHAT SHE WANTS TO AVOID 
NOW ARE CREDIT CARDS WHAT RAY 
BOULGER SUGGESTED IS SHE DOES THE 
OPPOSITE IN ORDER TO BUILD UP A 
CREDIT HISTORY THAT THEN CAN BE 
REFLECTED IN HER CREDIT REFERENCES 
WHEN SHE APPLIES FOR OTHER THINGS 
LETWIN'S LISTEN TO RAY BOULGER ON 
THAT POINT 
THINGS WHICH AFFECT 
THEM IS YOUR EXISTING CREDIT STATUS 
IF SOMEBODY HAS A LOT OF CASH BUT 
NO CREDIT THEN THEY WILL PROBABLY 
GET A BAD CREDIT SCORE THEY HAVE 
NOT PROVED THEY CAN HANDLE CREDIT 
FOR ANYONE IN THE SITUATION WHY 
WILL NOT GET A CREDIT CARD ON A 
GOOD INTEREST RATE WHAT THEY 
SHOULD DO IS APPLY FOR A CARD SET 
UP A DIRECT DEBIT TO PAY OFF THE 
BALANCE IN FULL EACH MONTH THE 
INTEREST RATE RATE IS THEN 
IRRELEVANT I WOULD GO FORWARD AND 
APPLY FOR TWO CREDIT CARDS TWO 
PAYMENTS MADE EACH MONTH WILL GIVE 
YOU A BETTER SCORE THAN ONE YOU 
NEED CREDIT TO GET A BIGGER AMOUNT 
OF CREDIT I. E. A MORTGAGE DON'T DON'T OVERSPEND ON THAT CREDIT CARD THAT 
IS WHAT GOT YOU INTO TROUBLE IN THE 
FIRST PLACE IT IS NOT A GREAT 
PLACE TO START FROM PEOPLE SHOULD 
NOT GET INTO THAT SITUATION SHARON SHARON HAS BEEN THROUGH IT NOW SHE HAS 
CHANGED HER ATTITUDE TO DEBT IT IS 
WORTH HAVING A LITTLE LISTEN TO HER 
AGAIN ADVICE TO PEOPLE ON HOW TO 
APPROACH YOUR SPENDING AND DEBT TO 
AVOID GETTING INTO HER POSITION 
LET'S HAVE ANOTHER LISTEN TO SHARON 
I WOULD NOT PERSONALLY GET MORE 
THAN THREE MONTHS WORTH OF SALARY 
IN DEBT BECAUSE I WOULD PAY THAT 
OFF IN A SHORT TIME L. AM LOOKING 
AT DISPOSAL INCOME DO I HAVE 
ENOUGH MONEY THERE TO PAY FOR 
THINGS DAY IN DAY OUT MANAGING 
YOUR MONEY MORE THAN YOU WOULD HAVE 
PREVIOUSLY I DO AMOUNT FOR 
EVERYTHING NOW IN ADVANCE RATHER 
THAN WAIT UNTIL INDICATE HAPPENS 
AND I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY THERE TO 
PAY FOR IT 
ONE THING I WOULD ADD 
ANYONE IN THIS POSITION IT IS A 
GOOD IDEA TO GO DOWN TO CITIZENS 
ADVICE BUREAU AND GO THROUGH THE 
SITUATION WITH THEM IT IS NOT 
NECESSARILY THE RIGHT MOVE FOR 
EVERYONE TO GO INTO AN I. V. A. AND 
THEY ARE THERE ARE OFTEN PRIORITY 
DEBTS TO BE DEALT WITH BEFORE YOU 
DO ANYTHING ELSE DEBTS THAT MIGHT 
INVOLVE YOU LOSING YOUR HOME OR 
POSSIBLY GOING TO PRISON IF THE 
TAXMAN IS BEING DEALT WITH IF YOU 
DON'T SORT THAT SORT OF THING OUT 
FIRST GET SOME ADVICE THEN LOOK 
AT CHOSEING THE RIGHT SORT OF 
ACTION IT MIGHT BE BANKRUPTSY AN 
I. V. A. OR A DEBT MANAGEMENT PLAN 
DON'T IMMEDIATELY PLUMP FOR ONE OF 
THOSE OPTIONS 
ADVICE FROM THE 
CITIZEN'S ADVICE IS FREE 
IT IS 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY 
LET'S LOOK AT THE REST OF THE 
BUSINESS NEWS BAEFPLTSISTEMS IS TO 
AXE SIX HUNDRED JOB BAEFPLTSISTEMS IS TO 
AXE SIX HUNDRED B. A. E. SYSTEMS IS TO AXE SIX HUNDRED 
JOBS AT BROUGH THE HOME OF THE 
HAWK AIRCRAFT 
TEENAGERS COULD FACE LARGE RISE 
IN UNIVERSITY TUWIGS FEES AND THE 
COST OF THE LOANS THEY TAKE OUT 
ACCORDING TO HIGHAM THAT IS THE 
TO THE HEPI THAT IS THE HEPI H. I. E. 
MINISTERS HAVE PROMISED TO REVIEW 
THE SYSTEM NEXT YEAR UNIVERSITIES 
MAY HAVE TO WAIVE THE FEE FOR THE 
THREE THOUSAND CAP TO MAKE SURE THE POOREST 
STUDENTS ARE NOT PUT OFF FROM

I HAD CHEAP GUESTS THE FAMILY 
DINNER TONNE WILL BE GOOD 
THE MARKET GOT OFF TO GOOD START 
MARKS AND AMP SPENCER'S TRIED TO RESPOND 
TO COMPLAINTS ABOUT SIR STUART ROSE 
TAKING ON THE ROLE AS CHAIRMAN AS 
WELL CHEEK THEY HAVE SUGGESTED HE 
WILL NOT HAVE PAY RISE AND WILL 
NEED TO BE RE ELECTED EACH YEAR AND 
MAKES SURE AN INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR 
DIRECTOR KEEPS A CHECK ON THE GROUP 
SHARES DOWN EIGHT PENCE TODAY 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE F. T. S. E. WILL BE DOWN 
I DON'T THINK IT WAS DOWN A LOT 
HOPEFULLY YOU CAN SEE YOUR 
FAVOURITE SHARE THERE 
NOW MOTHERCARE DELIVERED BONNY 
SET OF FIGURES 
MOTHERCARE BOUGHT THE EARNING 
LEARNING CENTRE AND ACTUAL SALES 
FIGURES INCREASED BECAUSE THEY HAVE 
A NEW DIVISION INCLUDED 
AH EVEN WITHOUT THAT LIKE FOR 
LIKE SALES ARE DOING VERY WELL 
LIKE FOR LIKE SALES IN THE FOURTH 
QUARTER ROSE TWENTY NINE PER CENT LIKE FOR LIKE 
INTERNATIONAL SALES IN THE FOURTH 
QUARTER ROSE AND THIS REALLY WAS 
GOING SOME ONE HUNDRED ONE PER CENT THEY HAVE DONE 
WELL COMPARED TO SHARES T. H. T. REST OF 
THE RETAIL SECTOR THE RETAIL 
SECTOR HAS BEEN UNDER UNDER 
PRESSURE THIS IS THE TOP OF THE 
LEAGUE THESE ARE THE BEST 
PERFORMERS AND THE FEW WHICH GAINED 
GROUND OVER THE YEAR 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR THE FIFTH 
SHARE DOWN HAS ONLY IMPROVED ONE PER CENT 
YOU CAN SEE GAINS MOTHERCARE 
SHARES UP SEVEN PER CENT SO FOURTH POSITION 
LOOK AT ITS SHARE PERFORMANCE OVER 
THE PAST YEAR WHEN WE SAW THIS 
PICK UP HERE THAT IS JANUARY THIS 
YEAR THEY REVEALED A GOOD SET OF 
SALES FIGURES AND THAT BOOSTED THE 
SHARE PERFORMANCE THE WHOLE MARKET 
DID HAVE A BOOST AROUND THAT TIME 
BUT WHILST THE F. T. S. E. FELL AFTER THAT 
MOTHERCARE'S SHARES CONTINUE TO DO 
WELL LET'S LOOK AT THE SHARE 
PERFORMANCE NOW 
ELSEWHERE HALFORDS EXPECTS FULL 
YEAR PROFITS TO MATCH MARKET 
EXPECTATIONS SALES GROWTH AT THE 
BUSINESS REALLY LEADING THE WAY 
THE FIRM REPORTED SALES UP SEVENTY TWO PER CENT 
REALLY GOOD OVER THE YEAR OVER THE 
SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR SALES GROWTH 
ACHIEVED IN ALL CATEGORIES SHARES 
HAD A TROUBLED TIME IN JUNE THEY 
WERE FOUR AND WENT DOWN TO TWO POINT FIVE OH AND 
THEY ARE UP FROM THAT LOW OF TWO POINT FIVE OH 
BUT DOWN TODAY 
MOSS BROS THEY FAMOUS FOR WEDDING 
STUFF AND ALL THAT FOR THE YEAR 
REPORTED A LOSS FOR THE YEAR AND 
CONFIRMED THAT BID TALKS ARE 
CONTINUING WITH BAUGUR THEIR 
SHARES UNCHANGED THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED IT 
IS DOWN TWENTY 
ALL THE MAJOR MARKETS ARE DOWN 
APART FROM JAPAN WHICH IN ITS LAST 
LAST SECTION WENT UP FIFTEEN PER CENT 
NIK 
THE TRADITIONAL SIGN OF 
APPRECIATATION FROM CONSTRUCTION 
WORKERS USELY FOR PASSING WOMEN MAY 
BECOME A THINK OF THE PAST ON THE 
BUILDING SITES AROUND BRISTOL 
FOLLOWING AN AN ORDER BY GEORGE 
WIMPEY IT IS NOT JUST TO SAVE 
ANYONE'S BLUSHES THERE IS A STRONG 
COMMERCIAL REASON FOR THE BAN 
ACCORDING TO THE MAN WHO IMPOSED IT 
AND RICHARD GOAD IS THE COMPANY'S 
REGIONAL MARKETING DIRECTOR AND 
JOINS US FROM BRISTOL 
THERE IS SERIOUS POINT BUS IT IS 
ABOUT BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT SELLING 
HOUSES 
WE ARE A PROFESSIONAL HOUSES RETAIL OUTLET AND WE FEEL IT IS 
IMPORTANT IN THE SAME WAY IF LADIES 
GO SHOPPING FOR A NEW CAR OR SOME 
NEW CLOTHES THEY ARE NOT WHISTLED 
AT BY STAFF WHY WOULD THEY EXPECT 
TO BE WHISTLED AT WHEN THEY COME TO 
A GEORGE WIMPEY OUTLET 
THERE IS DIFFERENCE TO NEXT AND 
THE GUYS IN BRISTOL WORKING ON A 
HOT BUILDING SITE 
THE ONLY 
DIFFERENCE IS WE ARE ACTUALLY 
MAKING OUR PRODUCT RIGHT THERE IN 
FRONT OF THE RETAIL OUTLET WHICH 
THE OTHER OUTLETS BRING THEIR 
PRODUCT IN SO WE FEEL IT IS 
IMPORTANT THAT WHEN LADIES AND 
THEIR PARTNERS ACTUALLY COME TO THE 
DEVELOPMENTS THAT THEY FEEL 
RESPECTED AND THEY ARE GREETED BY 
PROFESSIONAL STAFF RATHER THAN A 
WHISTLE 
IN MY HAND I HAVE TWO BITS WHISTLE OF PAPER 
ONE ABOUT A EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE 
STOPPING PEOPLE SAY LOVE IN PUBS 
WHICH A TORY M. P. OBJECTED TO AND ONE 
FROM OFFICE ANGELS AND LOTS OF 
PEOPLE WONDERING IF THEY CAN KISS 
AN EMPLOYEE ON THE CHEEKS WOLF 
WHISTLES YES BUT IT MAY GET OUT OF 
HAND 
BEING A NORTHERNER I WOULD HAND STRUGGLE TO NOT SAY LOVE WITH 
WHISTLING YOU ARE MAKING THE 
ATTEMPT TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF 
A LADY MY WIFE LIKES THE ATTENTION 
AND I HAVE TAKEN FLAK FROM HER BUT 
THERE IS WOMEN THAT DON'T LIKE THE 
ATTENTION WE ARE A PROFESSIONAL 
RETAIL OUTLET AND DON'T BELIEVE 
THAT LADIES SHOULD BE SUBJECT TODAY 
WHISTLING WHEN COMING TO BUY A NEW 
HOME FROM US 
ARE YOU GOING TO WORK 
IT INTO INDUCTION BECAUSE WE HEARD 
OF THE CONSIDERATE CONSTRUCTION 
SCHEME DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE 
WORKING IT INTO TRAINING 
WITHOUT A 
DOUBT AND I THINK NOW TO BE HONEST 
THE GUYS THAT I'VE SPOKEN TO ON 
SITE DON'T SEE IT AS A MAJOR ISSUE 
IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE MAJORITY 
DON'T ACTUALLY GET INVOLVED IN NOW 
AND I THINK YOUNG PEOPLE GROWING UP 
DO TEND TO RESPECT PEOPLE MORE 
RICHARD GOAD FROM GEORGE WIMPEY I 
WILL RESIST THE TEMP TEMPTATION TO 
WHISTLE YOU OUT 
IS THERE A FUTURE FOR FLOWER 
GROWERS IN THE U. K. CHEAP FOREIGN 
IMPORTS MADE LIFE DIFFICULT FOR 
PRODUCERS IN THIS COUNTRY IN THE 
THIRD OF HER REPORTS RACHEL HAS 
BEEN LOOKING AT FARM WHERE THE 
FLOWER TRADE IS BLOOMING 
HAD IS RARE SIGHT IN THE U. K. A 
FLOWER FARM WHOSE BUSINESS IS 
BLOOMING THE U. K. FLOWER GROWING 
INDUSTRY IS WILTING IN THE FACE OF 
CHEAPER FOREIGN IMPORTS AND RISING 
COSTS AND IT IS GETTING HARDER AND 
HARDER FOR U. K. FLOWER GROWERS TO 
MAKE PROFIT 
TWENTY YEARS AGO HALF THE FLOWERS 
BOUGHT IN THE U. K. WERE GROWN HERE 
TEN YEARS AGO THAT FIGURE HAD 
SHRUNK TO QUARTER AND TODAY JUST 
ONE IN TEN OF THE FLOWERS WE BUY 
HERE ARE HOME GROWN 
THE CLIMATE FOR U. K. GROWERS IS 
DIFFICULT AS IT IS FOR MANY PEOPLE 
IN THE U. K. AT THE MOMENT THE FIRST 
PRESSURE THEY FACE IS FOREIGN 
IMPORTS AS SOON AS A COUNTRY GETS 
A REGULAR INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT 
THEY LOOK TO PRODUCE PRODUCT FOR 
EXPORT TO GET FOREIGN CURRENCY SO 
WE ARE SEEING MORE COUNTRIES COMING 
INTO FLOWER PRODUCTION THE SECOND 
ISSUE IS LAND PRESSURES WE ARE 
LOOKING TO BUILD NEW HOMES MOST 
FLOWER FARMS ARE ON THE EDGES OF 
URBAN AREAS THAT'S PRIME TARGET 
FOR PROPERTY DEVELOPERS 
ONE FLOWER FARM'S BUSINESS TWENTY EIGHT 
MILES OFF THE COAST OF CORNWALL IS 
GROWING IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN ANDREW AND HIS 
WIFE SECURED THE TENANCY OF TWENTY SEVEN 
ACRES OF LAND ON SAINT MARTIN'S ONE 
OF THE ISLES OF SCILLY 
ORIGINALLY THEY PLAN TODAY FOLLOW 
THE TRADITIONAL BUSINESS MODEL 
SHIPPING TO THE MAINLAND AND 
SELLING TO WHOLESALERS BUT THINGS 
SOON CHANGED 
OUR TRANSPORT COSTS FROM THE 
ISLANDS ARE ENORMOUS AND WE FOUND 
THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY LOSING MONEY 
ON THE FARM WE NEEDED TO FIND A 
WAY OF GETTING O. OUR FLOWERS WHICH 
WE KNEW WERE POPULAR BUT TO 
CUSTOMERS IN A WAY WHICH ACTUALLY 
MADE IT VIABLE AND ECONOMIC FOR US 
WHAT HAPPENED IN FACT IS THAT WE 
WERE ASKED BY VISITORS TO THE 
ISLANDS COULD WE SEND FLOWERS BY 
POST YES WE COULD IT WAS 
SOMETHING WE WEREN'T GEARED UP FOR 
BUT WE DID START DOING THAT IN A 
SMALL WAY TO START WITH AND ONE OF 
THE PROBLEMS FOR US BY SENDING BY 
POST WAS THE FACT THAT WE ONLY HAD 
A POSTAL SERVICE ON THE ISLANDS 
THREE DAYS A WEEK 
SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER WITH MUCH 
IMPROVED POSTAL SERVICE SENT FROM 
THE ISLANDS SCENT ARE FROM THE 
ISLANDS IS THRIVING EACH YEAR THEY 
SEND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND BOXES DIRECT TO THEIR 
CUSTOMERS LAST YEAR'S TURNOVER 
BROKE THE ONE MILLION MARK AND THIS 
WITH PREDICTED GROWTH OF SEVENTEEN PER CENT 
THEY HOPE TO TURN OVER ONE POINT TWO MILLION 
HOW HAVE THEY DONE IT 
WE ARE 
SELLING DIRECT TO OUR CUSTOMERS WE 
ARE NOT GOING THROUGH THE WHOLESALE 
MARKETS THEREFORE WE CAN COMPETE 
AGAINST FLOWERS BEING FLOWN IN FROM 
KENYA WE DON'T HAVE A VERY LARGE 
CARBON CARBON FOOTPRINT AND PEOPLE 
ARE MORE AND MORE AWARE OF THAT AND 
WELFARE THE UNIQUE THING THAT WE 
HAVE A GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION THE 
FLOWERS ARE FROM THE ISLES OF 
SCILLY AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF 
MARKETED SCENTED NARCISSI FROM THE 
ISLES OF SCILLY 
FLOWER FARM SOMETHING SEASONAL BUSINESS BUSINESS YOUR SEASON IS OUT OF OF SYNC WITH 
TOURISM WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR YOUR 
BUSINESS 
WE DO TWENTY PER CENT OF OUR BUSINESS BUSINESS AT CHRISTMAS AT CHRISTMAS THE 
TOURISM INDUSTRY ISN'T BUSY WHICH 
MEANS THERE IS A FEW PEOPLE WHO ARE 
NOT REALLY REALLY BUSY IN THEIR 
OWN BUSINESSES SO THEY ARE MORE 
THAN HAPPY TO WORK FOR US SO WE 
NEARLY DOUBLE OUR WORKFORCE AT 
CHRISTMAS CHRISTMAS THE FUTURE IS LOOKING ROSY FOR 
CHURCHTOWN FLOWER FARM BUT THERE 
ARE OVER FIFTY FLOWER FARMS ON THE 
ISLES OF SCILLY AND THEIR ROOTS RUN 
DEEP ACCOUNTING FOR TEN PER CENT OF THE 
ISLAND'S ECONOMY 
FLOWER FARMING HAS BEEN IN DECLINE 
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS L. THINK IT 
HAS STABILISED NOW BUT IT IS 
NOWHERE NEAR WHERE IT WAS JUST 
AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR WHEN IT 
WAS A THRIVING INDUSTRY AND A LOT 
OF THE FLOWER GROWERS MADE A LOT OF 
MONEY IN ORDER TO TRY TO MAKE 
ECONOMIES OF OF SCALE A LOT OF THE 
FARMERS HAVE GOT TOGETHER NOW AND 
THEY'RE HELPING EACH OTHER THERE 
IS A CONSORTIUM GROUP AND THEY ACT 
AS A COLLECTION POINT FOR VARIOUS 
GROWERS AROUND THE ISLANDS ON 
DIFFERENT ISLANDS AS WELL AS ON SAINT 
MARY'S AND WHAT THEY DO IS TO SEEK 
OUT THE BEST MARKETS EACH DAY AND 
THEN ORGANISE THE TRANSPORT 
TRANSPORT SO THAT IT ALL GOES OFF 
AT ONCE TO CUT DOWN ON THE 
INDIVIDUAL COSTS 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN 
TO THE ECONOMY OF THE ISLES OF 
SCILLY IF FLOWER FARMING STOPPED 
WHAT WOULD WOULD HAPPEN IF IT 
STOPPED MOST OF THE FARMS WOULD 
CLOSE BECAUSE THERE IS LITTLE ELSE 
THAT WOULD GROW PROFITABLY IN THE 
SCILLY WE HAVE AEROGATION 
DIFFICULTIES THE TRANSPORT 
DIFFICULTIES WOULD APPLY TO 
VEGETABLE AS WELL THERE IS LITTLE 
ACTUALLY WE CAN ACTUALLY GROW ON 
THE FARMS OTHER THAN FLOWERS 
KEITH WAS BORN AND BROUGHT UP IN SAINT 
MARTIN'S YOU WORKED WITH THE 
JULIANS FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS FOR 
HIM FLOWER FARMING ISN'T JUST ABOUT 
THE ECONOMY IT IS ABOUT THE 
COMMUNITY COMMUNITY SPEAKING AS AN INDIGENOUS ISLANDER 
I BELIEVE THAT IT IS INTEGRAL TO 
OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR ECONOMY 
BECAUSE OUR STAFF ARE HERE TWELVE 
MONTHS OF THE YEAR DOING THE 
SUMMER WORK PREPARING FOR THE 
SEASON'S CROP IN THE WINTER BY 
LIVING HERE TWELVE MONTHS A YEAR THEY 
BECOME SO MUCH A PART OF OUR 
COMMUNITY IT IS IMPORTANT WE 
CANNOT LIVE IN ISOLATION AND THEY 
SPEND THEIR MONEY HERE THEY 
SUPPORT THE SHOP THE BOAT SERVICE 
HAS IMPROVED 
THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE TO USE IT SO 
MORE TRIPS ARE AVAILABLE SO 
EVERYTHING BENEFITS IF THE ECONOMY 
BENEFITS THROUGH THIS FARM THE 
WHOLE ISLAND BENEFITS 
FOR VISITORS TO THE ISLAND THESE 
FLOWERS ARE JUST ONE PART OF THE 
SPECTACULAR SCENERY BUT FOR THE 
ISLANDERS THEY REPRESENT A 
CONNECTION WITH THEIR PAST AND HOPE 
FOR THEIR FUTURE 
DON FORGET YOU CAN WATCH RACHEL'S 
FILMS AGAIN ON THE PLAYER
