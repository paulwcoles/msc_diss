BEGINNING TO MAKE THEMSELVES 
VISIBLE FOUR PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED

AT THE BEGINNING OF A WEEK THAT 
TURNED INTO A CHEST INFECTION HE IS

PRESIDENT SARKOZY OF FRANCE HE 
PLAYED A FULL PART IN THE 
PROCEEDINGS INCLUDING A HUGE STATE 
DINNER AT WINDSOR THE FACT THAT HE 
IS SPENDING A THIRD NIGHT IN

AN INFECTION

WORLD AND POLITICAL OPINION ASHLEY 
O'CONNOR IS THE A CORRESPONDENT FOR 
THE TIMES WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF 
PEOPLE WHO TRY TO DISRUPT WATT IS A 
FANTASTIC SPORTING EVENT 
IT IS 
NIGH E. V. TO THINK THE OLYMPICS ARE

FAMOUS NAMES HOW CAN THEY DISTANCE 
THEMSELVES FROM THE POLITICS OF

DEMONSTRATORS WILL MAKE A 
DISTINCTION BETWEEN SIR STEVE 
REDGRAVE AND SOMEONE LIKE THE 
CHINESE AMBASSADOR IF YOU ARE A 
SPORTS PERSON YOU CAN STAY 
DISTINCTION IF YOU ARE REPRESENTING 
CHINA AS SHE IS SHE WILL BE THE 
TARGET OF PROTESTERS AS THE 
DEMONSTRATORS

NORTHERN IRELAND AS WELL SO COLD 
AND WINTRY OUTSIDE THIS MORNING 
HEAVY SNOW IN PARTS OF THE SOUTH

MUCH AS SEVEN OR EIGHT CENTIMETRES 
WHICH IS WORTH REMEMBERING IF 
YOU'RE OUT AND ABOUT MAKING FIVE 
JOURNEY THIS MORNING A FEW WINTRY 
SHOWERS OVER WALES AS WELL AND A 
LIGHT COVERING OF SNOW IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND OVERNIGHT AND THERE WILL BE 
SHOWERS HERE FOR A TIME SNOW IN 
THE EASTERN HALF OF SCOTLAND AND 
GIVEN THE WIND THAT WILL DRIFT 
ESPECIALLY OVER THE HIGHER GROUND 
IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND DAMP 
GROUND AND FALLING TEMPERATURES 
NOT A GOOD START TO THE DAY 
DESPITE THE SUNSHINE SO HEAVY 
SNOWFALL ACROSS THE SOUTH MIDLANDS 
AND THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND A 
COVERING EVEN AT LOWER LEVELS 
WINTRY SHOWERS WILL FOLLOW BUT THE 
PERSISTENT SNOW FROM SCOTLAND WILL 
SINK INTO THE NORTH OF ENGLAND BY 
THE END OF THE DAY AND COLD 
PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTH EAST 
TEMPERATURES STRUGGLING TO GET 
ABOVE TWO OR THREE DEGREES FOR THE

SNOW SHOULD HAVE DIED OUT BY THIS 
AFTERNOON BUT IT WILL STILL BE 
VERY COLD AND DAMP TONIGHT THE 
SNOW WILL CLEAR AWAY FROM THE

ELSEWHERE A LINE OF SNOW WILL SINK 
DOWN ACROSS THE EAST MIDLANDS AND 
DOWN TO OITS ANGLIA BY MIDNIGHT 
AND THERE COULD BE ICY PATCHES AS 
THE TEMPERATURES FALL TO MINUS ONE 
OR TWO DEGREES IT SHOULD BE A 
DRIER AND BRIGHTER START TO MONDAY 
WITH A FEW SHOWERS OVER THE NORTH 
OF SCOTLAND AND THE NORTH WEST 
COASTS OF NORTHERN IRELAND IT WILL 
STILL BE A CHILLY DAY AND THE 
TEMPERATURES WILL DROP AWAY AS THE 
SHOWERS COME ALONG ON TUESDAY 
MORNING A RISK OF ICY PATCHES 
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND 
THERE WILL BE WINTRY SHOWERS DOTTED 
ABOUT BUT EQUALLY SPELLS OF 
SUNSHINE AND SLIGHTLY LESS COLD 
BUT DO TAKE CARE IN THE SNOW 
OUTSIDE THIS MORNING 
TAKE CARE AND TAKE SOME PICTURES AS 
WELL MAYBE HOW IS THE WEATHER 
OUTSIDE YOUR WINDOW THIS MORNING 
WE WANT YOU TO SEND US YOUR 
PICTURES BUT MAKE SURE YOU READ 
THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FIRST YOU 
WILL FIND HEM ON OUR WEBSITE 
IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO TO THE DAY 
THAT BRITISH TROOPS FIRST ENTERED 
BASRA TWO AND A HALF WEEKS AFTER 
CROSSING THE BORDER INTO IRAQ B. B. C. 
NEWS ASKED THREE SERVING SOLDIERS 
FOR THEIR MEMORIES OF THE INVASION 
PEARSE LALLY WAS A COMPANY 
QUARTERMASTER SERGEANT IN THE IRISH 
GUARDS THIS IS HIS STORY 
I'M REGANTIAL SERGEANT MAJOR PEARSE 
LALLY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THREE I WAS THE 
COMPANY QUARTERMASTER SERGEANT OF 
THE IRISH GUARDS 
WE LITERALLY CROSSED THE BORDER 
WITH HEAVY ARMOUR LIGHT ARMOUR AND 
HELICOPTERS NONE OF US HAD SEEN 
THAT TYPE OF FIRE POWER ALL COME 
TOGETHER WE'D ALL CLEARLY TRAINED 
IN SMALL PIECES BEFORE BUT 
ACTUALLY SEEING IT ON THE GROUND 
WAS QUITE AN EXPERIENCE MY ROLE AS 
COMPANY QUARTERMASTER WOULD 
NORMALLY TO BE EIGHT OR TEN 
KILOMETRES BEHIND THE MAIN ARMOUR 
AND THE WARRIOR FIGHTING VEHICLES 
BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY ON 
THIS MOVE BECAUSE THERE WAS SUCH A 
HEAVY VOLUME OF TRAFFIC IF YOU 
WANT TO CALL IT THAT THE WARRIORS 
WERE MOVING ACROSS THE OPEN DESERT 
AND I WAS IN LINE BUT MY LIGHT 
VEHICLES WERE DRIVING ALONG BESIDE 
THE COMPANY ENDED UP IN FORWARD 
OPERATING BASE JUST SHORT OF BASRA 
CITY AND JUST OFF THE WATERWAY ON A 
PLACE CALLED BRIDGE FOUR AND THEY 
SPENT ONE OR TWO DAYS THERE 
CARRYING OUT OPERATIONS ACROSS 
BRIDGE FOUR AND CARRYING OUT 
ATTACKS THE MAIN PROBLEMS AT THAT 
TIME WAS IN DIRECT FIRE COMING IN 
IN THE CASE OF LIGHT MORTARS IT 
WAS QUITE A WORRY THAT THE 
REFUELLING OF THE VEHICLES WE 
WOULD TAKE HIT SO WE HAD TO 
CONDUCT THAT UNDER THE HOURS OF 
DARKNESS AND THAT WAS DONE FAIRLY 
FRANTICCALLY WHEN I FOUND WHEN WE 
GOT INTO BASRA CITY ITSELF WE 
QUICKLY TRIED TO DISTANCE OURSELVES 
FROM SENDING OUT ARMOURED PATROLS 
USING WARRIOR AND I DISTINCTLY 
REMEMBER WITHIN FOUR HOURS OF 
MOVING INTO THE CITY WE HAD FOOT 
PATROLS ON THE GROUND AND MEETING 
THE LOCALS WHO CLEARLY WERE 
DELIGHTED TO SEE US AT THAT TIME 
WHEN WE RETURNED TO IRAQ LAST YEAR 
ON AN OPERATION WITH REGARD TO 
PATROLS AND MOVING AROUND THE CITY 
IT WAS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND 
THERE WAS REAL WORRY EVERY TIME 
WE DID HAVE TO CARRY OUT A MOVE AND 
THERE WAS LOT OF PREPARATION 
BEFORE THAT MOVE IT WAS TAKEN AS 
READ WHAT WHEN WE WERE MOVING FROM 
A TO B. THERE WOULD BE GUARANTEED 
CONTACT ON THIS MOVE OUR ROLE 
THERE WAS TO NURTURE ALONG AND 
TRAIN MONITOR AND MENTOR THE IRAQI 
ARMY ARMY IN THE FIRST INITIAL PART OF THE 
TOUR IT WAS QUITE DIFFICULT TO 
FOCUS ALL OUR EFFORTS ON THAT 
BECAUSE OF THE INTENSITY OF WAR 
FIGHTING THAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE 
THE CITY BUT WHEN BASRA AIRFIELD 
WAS CLOSED AND WE MOVED BACK INTO 
THE AIRFIELD THE INTENSITY OF 
OPERATIONS DRIED UP AND THAT FREED 
US TO DO THE MONITORING OPERATIONS 
I KNOW WE PERSONALLY ACHIEVED MORE 
THAN I AS AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD 
EXPECT TO BEFORE THAT TIME 
PEARSE LALLY WITH HIS STORY OF LIFE 
IN BASRA NOW A LOOK AT THE PAPERS 
STARTING WITH THE TELEGRAPH AND 
BORIS JOHNSON IS COMPLAINING THAT 
HE THINKS HE IS THE VICTIM OF A 
DIRTY TRICKS CAMPAIGN THAT HAS BEEN 
HACKING INTO HIS E. MAIL AND THERE 
ARE BLATANT LIES DETERMINED TO 
DISRUPT HIS PASSAGE AND CAMPAIGN TO 
LONDON MAYOR 
AND THE SUNDAY TIMES LEADS ON A 
STORY ABOUT NPOWER ONE OF THE BIG 
ENERGY COMPANIES AND WHAT THEY SAY 
ARE DIRTY TRICKS DIRT L. DIRTY 
TRICKS SEEMS TO BE THE THEME THIS 
MORNING THEY SAY THERE ARE THE 
PAPER SAYS THEY ARE CARRYING OUT 
DIRTY SALES TRICKS AND THE COMPANY 
SAYS THEY'RE SHOCKED BY THE PAPER'S 
ALLEGATION AS AND VICTORY FOR THE 
GRAND NATIONAL WINNER AND THE 
ARREST OF A SHIA LEADER AND PLANS 
TO INTRODUCE CADET CORP TRAINING IN 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS A LETTER HAS 
BEEN SENT TO THE GOVERNMENT

KELLY HOLMES TONIGHT IN A SPECIAL 
PROGRAMME ABOUT THE ROUTE OF THE 
TORCH AROUND LONDON TONIGHT AND 
THERE IS A WHO'S WHO OF WHO IS 
CARRYING THE TORCH SIR TREVOR 
MCDONALD AND DENISE VAN OUTEN AND 
SIR STEVEN REDGRAVE AND MANY 
OTHERS OTHERS NOW A STORY ABOUT THE MAN WHO DUPED 
THE BIGGEST SUPERPOWER IN THE WORLD 
CODE NAMED CURVE BALL CHRIS 
PROFILES THE IRAQI AGENT WHOSE 
BOGUS CLAIMS BECAME THE BASIS FOR 
THE WAR IN IRAQ 
WELCOME TO REPORTERS MY NAME IS 
MIKE EMABLY THE WAR IN IRAQ WAS 
SOLD AS ONE TO MAKE THE WORLD SAFE 
FROM WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION 
THEY TURNED OUT NOT TO EXIST SO 
HOW DID THE AMERICANS GET THINGS SO 
WRONG IT TURNED OUT THE KEY SOURCE 
WAS AN AGENT CODENAMED CURVE BALL 
WHO HASN'T BEEN SEEN SINCE THE WAR 
BEGAN HE CLAIMED HE WAS AN EXPERT 
WITH VITAL EVIDENCE ABOUT SADDAM 
HUSSEIN'S WEAPONS PROGRAMME 
HIS FINDINGS WERE USED IN A SPEECH 
BY COLIN POWELL TO THE U. S. CONGRESS 
BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT AGENT WAS 
LYING AND IT ALL HELPED TO LEAD TO 
THE WAR IN IRAQ 
THE CRUCIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT LED 
TO THE IRAQ WAR CAME FROM A SINGLE 
SOURCE 
WE KNOW THAT IRAQ IN THE SOURCE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES HAD SEVERAL MOBILE 
BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS LABS 
THEY CAN 
PRODUCE ENOUGH DRY BIOLOGICAL AGENT 
IN A SINGLE MONTH TO KILL THOUSANDS 
UPON THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HIS HIS WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION 
DESTRUCTION PROGRAMME IS ACTIVE 
DETAILED AND GROW 
GROWING 
AFTER THE WAR THE INTELLIGENCE 
CASE COLLAPSED 
WE WERE WRONG AND 
I PRESENTED WRONG INFORMATION 
THE EVIDENCE ABOUT SADDAM HAVING 
ACTUAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS HAS TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG 
FIVE YEARS ON WE'RE STILL LEARNING 
THE REAL STORY OF WHY AND HOW OUR 
SPY AGENCIES AND GOVERNMENTS GOT 
THEIR FACTS SO WRONG 
AT THE HEART OF THE STORY IS AN 
IRAQI AGENT CODENAMED CURVEBALL 
DESCRIBED AS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
SOURCE OF THEM ALL 
THIS DEFECTIVE 
IS CURRENTLY HIDING IN ANOTHER 
COUNTRY WITH THE CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE 
THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN WILL KILL HIM 
IF HE FINDS HIM 
THE WHEREABOUTS OF 
CURVEBALL ARE A MISTY UNTIL NOW HE 
HAS BEEN TRACKED DOWN THE SECRETS 
FROM THE FILE OF CURVEBALL PROVIDE 
A FASCINATING PROCESS OF HOW THE 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES DO THEIR WORK 
AND HOW THEY MAKE MISTAKES 
SO HOW DID CURVEBALL BECOME SO 
IMPORTANT THE STORY BEGINS IN 
EUROPE EUROPE WHEN GEORGE BUSH AND TONY BLAIR 
MADE THE INTELLIGENCE CASE AGAINST 
SADDAM HUSSEIN THEY GAVE THE 
IMPRESSION THEY HAD SPIES AT THE 
HEART OF HIS REGIME BUT IT TURNED 
OUT MOST OF THEIR KEY SOURCES HAD 
LEFT THE COUNTRY LONG AGO THEIR 
MOST IMPORTANT SPY WAS ALSO RUN 
NOT BY BRITAIN OR AMERICA BUT BY A 
COUNTRY THAT IN PUBLIC HAD 
OPPOSED THE WAR HE WAS RUN BY THE 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY WHOSE 
HEADQUARTERS ARE BEHIND ME THE B. M. D. 
GERMANY'S INTELLIGENCE SERVICE 
THE GERMANS THOUGHT THEY HAD THE 
PERFECT SOURCE HIS NAME WAS RAFIED 
ALWAN A TRAINED CHEMICAL ENGINEER 
WHO IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES WAS WORKING IN 
IRAQ'S CHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING 
DESIGN CENTRE HIS BOSSES REMEMBER 
ALWAN AS QUIET AND HARD WORKING HE HE WAS HARD WORKING AND JUST LIKE AN 
ACTIVE ENGINEER HE WAS ACTIVE IN 
DOING WHAT HE WAS ASKED TO DO 
ALWAN OR CURB BALL LEFT IRAQ IN 
THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES AND ENDED UP IN 
GERMANY IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE HE JOINED OTHER 
ASYLUM SEEKERS IN NUREMBERG BUT HE 
WAS SOON LEADING DOUBLE LIFE 
EARNING CASH OSTENSIBLY IN 
CHINESE RESTAURANT BUT GAINING 
MONEY FROM OTHER SOURCES IRAQI IRAQI FRIENDS OF CURVEBALL WHO KNEW HIM 
IN GERMANY IN THE EARLY YEARS HAS 
SAID THAT HE LIVED AT A STANDARD OF 
LIVING THAT THEY COULD NOT DREAM OF 
BUT WHAT IS OBVIOUS WHERE HE GOT 
THE MONEY FROM 
THEY DIDN'T KNOW 
WHERE HE GOT THE MONEY FROM 
CURVEBALL HAD BEEN RECRUITED BY 
GERMAN INTELLIGENCE WHEN HE CAME TO 
BE QUESTIONED BY HIS ASYLUM CLAIM 
THERE IS A VERY LONG LINE FOR IRAQI 
ASYLUM SEEKERS IN GERMANY AT THAT 
TIME ONE OF THE WAYS TO GET TO THE 
FRONT OF THE LINE IS IF YOU HAVE 
SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO TELL THE 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES CURVEBALL 
WAS QUESTIONED HE SAID HE HAD 
WORKED ON THESE BIOLOGICAL PROJECTS 
THAT GOT THE GERMAN INTELLIGENCE 
SERVICES VERY INTERESTED AND THREE 
MONTHS LATER HE HAD PERMISSION TO 
STAY IN GERMANY AND WAS GRANTED 
ASYLUM 
SO WHAT DID CURVEBALL TELL ASYLUM HIS GERMAN HANDLER HIS INFORMATION 
WAS SHOCKING OVER ONE HUNDRED DETAILS WERE 
PASSED ON TO THE AMERICANS AND THEY 
CONFIRMED A KEY PART OF COLIN 
POWELL'S STATEMENT TO AMERICA ON 
THE REASONS FOR WAR 
WHEN I CAME BACK FROM THAT MEETING 
I TOLD THE PEOPLE TO GET ALL MY 
FILES ON CURVEBALL AND FIND OUT ALL 
ABOUT HIM BECAUSE I THOUGHT WE WERE 
HEADING FOR A PROBLEM AT THAT 
POINT ONE DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS THE ONLY 
SOURCE I STILL NAIVELY THOUGHT 
THERE HAD TO BE OTHER SOURCES WE 
COULDN'T JUST HAVE ONE SOURCE ON 
THIS BUT I SAID THIS GUY IS 
IMPORTANT AND WE HAVE TO GET TO THE 
BOTTOM OF IT 
TEN MONTHS BEFORE POWELL'S SPEECH 
ANOTHER WARNING CAME FLASHING TO 
WASHINGTON WASHINGTON ACCORDING TO A U. S. INTELLIGENCE 
REPORT A FOREIGN SERVICE 
IDENTIFIED AS M. I SIX TOLD THE C. I. A. IN 
TWO THOUSAND TWO THAT ELEMENTS OF 
SO DOUBTS ABOUT CURVEBALL'S 
RELIABILITY HAD BEEN BUILDING UP 
FOR MONTHS BEFORE POWELL'S SPEECH 
IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO THE U. S. 
PRESENTATION SOME OPERATIVES WERE 
SO CONCERNED THAT THEY SUGGESTED 
THAT ALL REFERENCES TO CURVEBALL'S 
CLAIMS SHOULD BE DELETED FROM THE 
SPEECH BUT THEY WERE IGNORED THEY THEY HAD GIVEN US A COPY OF THE SPEECH 
WHERE WE HAD OUTLINED THE PASS AGES 
OF CURVEBALL'S INFORMATION AND WE 
SAID DID WE GET SENT THE WRONG 
SPEECH AND THEY SAID NO THEY 
JUST DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO YOU 
ALL THOSE WHO KNEW HIM IN NUREMBERG 
SAY HE VANISHED IN TWO THOUSAND THREE AND HE HAS 
NEVER BEEN SEEN SINCE BUT SOME 
HAVE MANAGED TO TRACK HIM DOWN 
CURVEBALL HAS GAINED A LOT OF 
WEIGHT HE IS VERY NERVOUS AND 
TROUBLED HE LIVES IN SOUTHERN 
GERMANY HE'S NOT DOING VERY WELL 
RIGHT NOW 
HE'S SPOKEN TO CURVEBALL 
ON MANY OCCASIONS A FEW WEEKS AGO 
HE SECRETLY FILMED HIM 
THESE ARE THE FIRST IMAGES WE'VE 
SEEN SINCE THE IRAQ WAR OF THE MAN 
WHOSE EVIDENCE HELPED LEAD TO THAT 
WAR WAR THOUGH HE HAS SPOKEN TO JOHN MANY 
TIMES OFF CAMERA CURVEBALL REFUSES 
TO TELL HIS FULL STORY 
ASTONISHINGLY HIS CLAIM IS NOW 
THAT HE NEVER EVEN MADE A KEY 
ALLEGATIONS THAT HE WITNESSED A 
BIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT IN IRAQ 
CURVEBALL SAYS THAT HE NEVER LIED 
ABOUT ANYTHING HE SAYS THAT HE 
NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT WEAPONS 
OF MASS DESTRUCTION HE SAYS THAT 
HE ALWAYS TOLD THE TRUTH HE SAYS 
THAT FOR ALL OF THE IMPORTANT 
INFORMATION THAT HE GAVE THE 
GERMANS THAT HE SHOULD LIVE LIKE 
KING HE IS VERY UPSET THAT HE DOES 
NOT HAVE HIS PASSPORT YET HE HAS 
BEEN WAITING FOR HIS PASSPORT HE 
FEELS THAT EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN 
SAID ABOUT HIM SINCE THE END OF THE 
WAR IS NOT TRUE AND THEN HE ALSO 
SAYS I'M HAPPY TO TELL YOU MY FULL 
STORY BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO 
PAY ME LOT OF MONEY FOR IT 
WHATEVER CURVEBALL NOW SAYS 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES LIKE THE C. I. A. 
AND MIX NEXT WHO HAVE BOTH NOW MET 
HIM ARE CONVINCED HE TOLD A SERIES 
OF LIES BUT WHAT WAS HIS 
MOTIVATION WAS HE ENCOURAGED BY 
THE GERMANS TO SAY MORE THAN HE 
KNEW 
THIS MAIN MOTIVATION WAS NOT KNEW TO START A WAR WITH HUSBAND HAD 
HUSBAND OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT 
WAS STRICTLY TO STAY IN GERMANY AND 
GET HIS FAMILY THERE 
HOW COME THEY 
BELIEVE A SINGLE PERSON THEY KNOW 
NOTHING ABOUT HIS HISTORY THEY 
ONLY KNOW WHAT HE HAS TOLD THEM 
THEY'RE DEFINITELY MORE CLEVER THAN 
THAT SO POSSIBLY IT WAS ONLY AN 
EXCUSE IN MY OPINION THERE WHAT 
HAPPENED IN IRAQ THERE ARE OTHER 
ACTS IN THATA 
SPY AGENCY'S 
REPUTATION IS MAINTAINED BY KEEPING 
ITS SECRETS SAFE BUT THERE IS A 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE WHO TELL 
THE TRUTH AND THOSE WHO FABRICATE 
IN THE CASE OF CURVEBALL THIS MAY 
HAVE COST MANY LIVES THAT'S ALL 
FROM REPORTERS FOR THIS WEEK

NEWS STILL TO COME 
THE NEED FOR SPEED WE HEAR HOW 
AMERICANS ARE BEING LET DOWN BY THE 
SLOW SERVICE OF THEIR INTERNET 
PROVIDERS AND HOW YOUR D. N. A. COULD 
SOON BE HANGING ON YOUR WALL M. T. 
WELL WE WERE WATCHING HEAVY SCENES 
OF SNOWFALL IN LONDON WHAT IS THE 
WEATHER LIKE OVERALL 
GOOD MORNING A MET OFFICE SEVERE 
WEATHER WARNING IN FORCE 
PARTICULARLY FOR SOUTHERN PARTS OF 
ENGLAND AND THE MIDLANDS AND PARTS 
OF NORTHERN IRELAND AND SOUTHERN 
SCOTLAND AS WELL FIVE TO TEN 
CENTIMETRES ARE FALLING IN PLACES 
OF SNOW SO TAKE CARE IF YOU ARE 
OUT ON THE ROADS AND OVER THE 
SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND IT IS A 
MIXTURE OF SLEET AND SNOW IN WALES 
A FEW SHOWERS COULD DEVELOP AS WELL 
A FEW SCATTERED WINTRY SHOWERS OVER 
NORTHERN IRELAND TO START THE DAY 
BUT MORE PROLONGED SPELLS OF SNOW 
OVER SCOTLAND'S HIGH GROUND THEY 
HAVE ALREADY CLOSED THE M. FIFTY SIX IN THE 
WARNING TON AREA BECAUSE OF THE 
SNOW SO BE CAREFUL IF YOU HAVE TO 
MAKE A JOURNEY IN THE NEXT FEW 
HOURS THE SNOW WILL CREEP 
SOUTHWARDS AS THE DAY GOES ON AND 
BEHIND IT WINTRY SHOWERS WILL 
FOLLOW AND THE SNOW IN EASTERN 
SCOTLAND WILL SINK SOUTHWARDS 
GETTING INTO THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
BY THIS AFTERNOON AND THREE IS THE 
TOP TEMPERATURE IN LONDON WITH THE 
CLOUDY AND COLD CONDITIONS IT 
SHOULD HAVE DRIED UP BY THE TIME 
THE MATCH STARTS FOR THE F. A. CUP 
SEMI FINAL AT WEMBLEY AND ALL THE 
COVERAGE WILL BE ON B. B. C. RADIO FIVE 
LIVE LIVE THE SNOW WILL GET DOWN TOWARDS THE 
WASH BY THE END OF THE NIGHT 
ELSEWHERE MAINLY DRY IN THE FAR 
NORTH WEST OF SCOTLAND BUT AS THE 
TEMPERATURES DROP AWAY THERE COULD 
BE ICY PATCHES ON THE ROADS AND IT 
WILL BE TREACHEROUS OVERNIGHT AND 
INTO THE MORNING AS WELL ON MONDAY 
MORNING A FEW WINTRY SHOWERS WILL 
DEVELOP ACROSS EAST ANGLIA AND 
ACROSS THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND INTO 
THE SOUTH OF WALES AS WELL 
ELSEWHERE NOT TOO BAD WITH SOME 
SPELLS OF BRIGHT SUNSHINE BUT IN 
SCOTLAND TEMPERATURES WILL FALL 
AWAY AS THE WINTRY SHOWERS COME 
ALONG ALONG ON TUESDAY AGER A FEW SCATTERED 
SHOWERS WHICH WILL BE WINTRY 
WHAT IS THE WEATHER LIKE OUTSIDE 
YOUR WINDOW THIS MORNING WE'RE 
SEEING HEAVY SNOW SHOWERS OUTSIDE 
TELEVISION CENTRE RIGHT NOW THIS 
IS A LIVE SHOT WE'VE GRABBED FOR 
YOU IN CENTRAL LONDON YOU CAN SEE 
THE SNOW SHOWERS FALLING THERE 
HEAVILY WE WONDER HOW LONG IT WILL 
TAKE BEFORE WE HEAR ABOUT TRAINS 
NOT OPERATING 
YES PRETTY HEAVY AND COULD CAUSE 
PROBLEMS FOR THE TORCH RELAY YOU 
CAN E. MAIL US YOUR PICTURES IF YOU 
HAVE THEM 
THE DETAILS ARE ON THE BOTTOM OF 
THE SCREEN 
AND YOU HAVE BEEN SENDING IN SOME 
PICTURES ALREADY WHICH WE'RE GOING 
TO SHOW YOU SOME THIS IS FROM RAY 
WHO SENT THIS IN FROM THE SUBURBS 
OF GLOUCESTER 
AND THIS ONE WERE TENI FROM HER 
WINDOW IN HERTFORDSHIRE 
AND YVONNE IN MILTON KEYNES HAS 
SENT US THIS EARLY MORNING SCENE OF 
SNOW THERE SNIPE AND THIS IS FROM 
BOSWORTH IN WARWICKSHIRE THIS HAS 
BEEN SENT IN BY STEVE GLOVER ON 
WHAT HE SAYS IS HIS FIRST CARAVAN 
TRIP WHICH I THINK WILL BE QUITE 
MEMORABLE I HOPE NOBODY WAS IN 
THAT TENT WHICH HAS FALLEN OVER 
LET'S TURN TO THE OLYMPIC RELAY 
THROUGH THE STREETS OF LONDON TODAY 
THE TORCH WILL BE CARRIED BY ABOUT 
EIGHTY TORCHBEARERS THEY WILL BE 
BRINGING IT RIGHT ACROSS THE CITY 
BUT IT IS LIKELY TO BE ACCOMPANIED 
BY SOME PROTESTS AS WELL BY THOSE 
WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THE CHINESE 
GOVERNMENT AND IN PARTICULAR ITS 
CAMPAIGN AND ACTIONS IN TIBET SO 
SHOULD THERE BE A CLEAR DISTINCTION 
BETWEEN SPORT AND POLITICS ASHLING 
O'CONNOR IS THE OLYMPIC 
CORRESPONDENT FOR THE TIMES 
NEWSPAPER CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO 
PEOPLE WHERE THIS WHOLE IDEA OF 
HAVING A TORCH CARRYING RELAY 
THROUGH A CITY COMES FROM 
IT COMES 
FROM 
ANCIENT GREECE 
NO THE FROM FLAME MIGHT HAVE COME FROM IT BUT 
IT WAS RESURRECTED BY ADOLF HITLER 
SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE 
MIGHT THINK IT IS PROPAGANDA TOOL 
AND THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN COMPARED 
TO THAT PERHAPS SLIGHTLY UNFAIRLY 
BUT ATHENS WAS THE FIRST TIME IT 
WENT AROUND THE WORLD AND THIS IS 
THE BIGGEST AND MOST ELABORATE TOUR 
AFTER THAT 
SO IT IS GETTING 
BIGGER 
INDEED AND OTHER THAN THE BIGGER TOP OF MOUNT EVEREST YOU CAN'T GET 
MORE OF A STATEMENT THAN THAT AND 
PERHAPS LONDON SHOULD HOLD IT BACK 
BECAUSE IT IS REALLY TO IN SPIRE 
ENTHUSIASM IN THE NATION HOSTING 
THE OLYMPICS RATHER THAN ATTRACT 
PROPAGANDA AROUND THE WORLD AND AND TODAY IT IS ALSO GOING TO ATTRACT 
POLITICAL PROTESTS 
WHICH IS 
INEVITABLE BUT ACTUALLY I THINK IT 
IS A GOOD THING FOR THE PROTESTERS 
AS WELL BECAUSE IT GIVES A FOCAL 
POINT WHERE THE CHINESE WILL HAVE 
TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS OR AT 
LEAST ADDRESS THE ISSUES RAISED 
RIGHT FROM NOW UNTIL AUGUST EIGHTH 
WHEN THE OPENING CEREMONY IN 
BEIJING HAPPENS 
IT IS DIFFICULT 
FOR THOSE INVOLVED IN THIS TODAY 
STEVEN REDGRAVE WAS SAYING IT IS AN 
EASY HIT FOR CAMPAIGNERS WE'RE 
SPORTS PEOPLE WHEN WE COMPETE IT 
IS AN OLYMPIC MEDAL NOT A BEIJING 
MEDAL SO THEY ARE CAUGHT A BIT 
THEY ARE REALLY BUT THEY KNOW 
WHAT THEY SIGNED UP TO THE SPORT 
WILL DO THE TALKING IN AUGUST BUT 
IF THEY ARE GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN 
THE RUN UP TO THE GAMES AND 
EVERYTHING IT SAYS ABOUT THE 
CHINESE AND THE CHINESE WAY OF LIFE 
THEY HAVE TO PRESIDENT TO BE ASKED 
THOSE HARD QUESTIONS 
WE WILL BE 
TALKING TO SIR STEVEN REDGRAVE 
LATER ON ASHLING THANK YOU VERY
