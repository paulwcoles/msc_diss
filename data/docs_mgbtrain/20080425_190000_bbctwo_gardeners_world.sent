IT'S THIS DELIGHTFUL LITTLE WOODLAND GLADE 
AND I'M EXTENDING THE FLOWERING SEASON HERE BY PLANTING MASSES OF BLUEBELLS 
THIS WAS A PROJECT THAT MONTY STARTED JUST LAST AUTUMN 
WELL HE'S TAKING A WELL DESERVED REST AT THE MOMENT 
AND HE'LL BE BACK WITH US IN MID JUNE FOR GARDENERS' WORLD LIVE 
MEANWHILE I'M GOING TO BE HOLDING THE FORT 
AND IT'S GOING TO BE GARDENING AS USUAL HERE AT BERRYFIELDS 
HELLO AND WELCOME TO GARDENERS' WORLD 
NOW THIS WOODLAND LITTLE GLADE WAS A BIT OF AN EXPERIMENT 
MONTY PUT DOWN CARDBOARD HERE RIGHT ON TOP OF THE GROUND 
AND PILED UP LEAF MOULD ON THE TOP AND PLANTED STRAIGHT INTO IT 
WELL IT'S BEEN AN OUTSTANDING SUCCESS 
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO IT LOOKED GLORIOUS 
JUST FULL BURGEONING WITH WILD DAFFODILS 
SCILLAS ANEMONES 
BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TRY AND EXTEND THAT FLOWERING SEASON 
IT'S IMPORTANTLY AESTHETICALLY BUT MUCH MORE SO FOR THE INSECTS WHO VISIT HERE 
AND WHO NEED THAT VALUABLE NECTAR FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE 
SO TO THAT END 
I'M STARTING OFF BY PLANTING BLUEBELLS 
I'M PLANTING UP TO A THOUSAND OF THEM 
I'M PLANTING EACH ONE INDIVIDUALLY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE 
ALYS IS DOING EXACTLY THE SAME THING WITH ALLIUM URSINUM 
WITH RAMSONS WITH WILD GARLIC 
AND HOPEFULLY BOTH THESE PLANTS ARE GOING TO COLONIZE BRILLIANTLY 
BUT I'M ALSO GOING TO PLANT A LOVELY THING 
WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE PERHAPS DON'T REALISE IS A BRITISH NATIVE 
IT'S LILY OF THE VALLEY 
AND THE PLANTING METHOD FOR THIS IS QUITE DIFFERENT 
THIS LITTLE THING LIVES JUST UNDER THE SURFACE OF THE SOIL 
EVERY SO OFTEN ALONG ITS LENGTH ARE THESE 
TUFTS OF FIBROUS FEEDING ROOTS 
AND AT THE END ARE THESE BEAUTIFUL NEW SHOOTS 
SO THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I'M GOING TO PLANT IT IN HERE 
IN A SORT OF LITTLE NARROW TRENCH 
JUST SPREAD THEM OUT OVER AN AREA 
DON'T DOT THEM ABOUT REALLY HELP THEM TO COLONIZE THEM BEAUTIFULLY 
AND OF COURSE THE THING IS 
YOU DON'T NEED A WOODLAND GLADE TO BE ABLE TO USE THESE SORT OF PLANTS 
THEY ALL LOVE SHADE SO EVEN IF YOUR SHADE'S CREATED BY YOUR GARAGE 
THEY'LL STILL THRIVE 
THE THEME OF TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME IS EXPANDING YOUR GARDENING HORIZONS 
LATER ON I'LL BE IN THE COTTAGE GARDEN 
SOWING PLANTS TO PROVIDE A COLOURFUL AND EDIBLE TWIST TO THE EXISTING PLANTING 
JOE'LL BE ON HIS ALLOTMENT 
PLANTING UP UNUSUAL FRUIT AND VEG 
AND WE'LL BE TAKING A LOOK AT A GROUP OF PLANTS THAT ARE BRAND NEW FOR BERRYFIELDS 
WHICH ARE GOING TO ADD A DRAMATIC AND PRICKLY DIMENSION TO OUR DRY GARDEN 
BUT FIRST WE'RE GOING TO BE REALLY EXPANDING OUR HORIZONS 
IN FACT WE'RE GOING TO BE EXPANDING OUR NECTAR BAR 
NOW THIS LOVELY AREA OVER HERE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS NOW 
AND IT'S GOT BETTER EACH TIME 
THE LAST THING THAT WAS DONE TO IT WAS MONTY PLANTED A WHOLE LOAD OF CAMASIAS IN THERE LAST AUTUMN 
AND HE'LL BE THRILLED TO SEE THEY'RE COMING UP AND DOING REALLY REALLY WELL 
THEY'RE GONNA BE IN FLOWER IN A 
THE WHOLE POINT ABOUT THE NECTAR BAR IT WAS MEANT TO DRAW IN INSECTS 
ALL SORTS OF CREATURES LOTS OF INVERTEBRATES BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO ENRICH THE GARDEN 
AND AS DIVERSE A RANGE AS WE POSSIBLY COULD 
BUT IT'S IN FAIRLY FULL LIGHT OVER THERE 
IT'S PLANTED IN A LOVELY SORT OF INFORMAL KIND OF WAY 
OVER HERE MONTY'S INTENTION WAS TO EXTEND IT TO AN AREA 
WHICH PROVIDES A DIFFERENT SET OF ENVIRONMENTS HABITATS 
THIS IS GOING TO BE A REALLY SHADY AREA 
NOT ONLY IS IT GOING TO BE OVERLOOKED BY THESE TREES 
BUT WITHIN IT THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF CORNUS AND SALIX ALREADY 
AND WE'RE GOING TO ADD TO IT TODAY 
BUT BEFORE I EVEN THINK OF BUYING ANYTHING FOR THIS BORDER WE WANT 
TO USE AS MANY THINGS AS WE POSSIBLY CAN 
THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE GARDEN 
AND THIS IS A GLORIOUS ROSA ALBA 
THAT USED TO LIVE IN THE END OF THE LONG BORDERS 
BUT NOW IT'S GOING TO HAVE A TOTALLY NEW EXISTENCE HERE 
WELL ROSA ALBA HAS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE GROUPS OF OLD ROSES 
SHOULDN'T BE OF COURSE COS IT MEANS WHITE 
AND BEING FROM LANCASHIRE I SHOULD BE SUPPORTING THE OTHER SIDE 
BUT EM 
THE WONDERFUL THING ABOUT ROSA ALBA 
IS THAT NOT ONLY IS IT ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND ELEGANT OF ALL THE OLD ROSES 
IT'S ALSO GOT A VERY VERY BEAUTIFUL FRAGRANCE 
AND THAT'S A SURE SIGN IT'S GOING TO BE BELOVED BY INSECTS 
I THINK THAT'S GOOD AND DEEP 
ALL I'M GOING TO INCORPORATE IS A LOAD OF THIS REALLY GOOD COMPOST 
ROSES REALLY DO ENJOY HEAVY SOIL 
IT'S LOVELY AND FERTILE 
THAT COMPOST WILL HELP GET THESE ROOTS OFF TO A FLYING START 
IT SHOULD HAVE STARTED TO MAKE LOTS AND LOTS OF LITTLE FIBROUS ROOTS 
WHICH IT HAS WONDERFUL 
AND WITH A BIT OF LUCK 
THIS HOLDS JUST ABOUT THE RIGHT DEPTH TOO 
I'M JUST GOING TO GENTLY PUSH IT FIRST OF ALL 
TO GET IT TO JUST THE SAME 
SORT OF DEPTH THAT IT WAS 
AS THE PLACE IT'S CAME OUT OF 
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS INTIMATELY 
IN CONTACT WITH THE SOIL 
I'M GONNA FIRM IN RIGHT THE WAY AROUND 
JUST TO CHECK GIVE IT A TUG 
THAT'S GOING NOWHERE AT ALL 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST ROSES I WANT TO INCLUDE IN HERE 
I'VE GOT SOME LOVELY FOXGLOVES AND I WANT TO PUT THEM IN TOO 
SO JUST LOOK AT THESE 
THESE ARE LOVELY LITTLE PLANTS THAT HAVE BEEN COLLECTED 
ALL AROUND THE GARDEN AND THEY'VE BEEN POTTED UP 
AND I THINK THEY'RE ALL READY TO GO IN 
IT'S JUST DIGITALIS PURPUREA 
OUR NATIVE FOXGLOVE 
SO IT'S AN IDEAL PLANT FOR OUR NATIVE WILDLIFE 
AND EVERYBODY'S GOT THAT IMAGE IN THEIR HEAD OF BUMBLE BEES JUST YOU KNOW 
GOING INTO THOSE GREAT BIG DEEP BELLS 
NOW THIS IS A PRESENT FROM MY GARDEN 
TO THE NEW PART OF THE NECTAR BAR AT BERRYFIELDS 
AND IT'S A GREAT BIG OF ASTRANTIA 
AND YOU CAN SEE WHERE I'VE SEVERED IT 
FROM THE SORT OF PARENT PLANT 
BUT I WANT TO CHOP IT 
WITH A SPADE RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH THERE 
COS IT'S GOT THIS HARD ROOT AND THEN IT'S GOT LOTS OF FIBROUS ROOTS 
I THINK IT'LL ESTABLISH REALLY WELL AND I THINK IT'S THE PERFECT PLANT TO PUT IN THIS PLACE 
I REALLY THINK THIS NECTAR BORDER IS GOING TO MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE HERE 
AND PROVIDE AN ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL MANNER OF CREATURES 
SO MANY OF OUR NATURAL HABITATS ARE VANISHING RAPIDLY 
AND IT'S UP TO WE GARDENERS REALLY TO TRY AND REDRESS THAT BALANCE WHERE WE CAN 
ONE OF THE PLACES THAT'S DISAPPEARING FASTEST IS FRESHWATER HABITATS 
WE'VE GOT OUR WONDERFUL POND HERE AT BERRYFIELDS 
BUT EVERYBODY CAN PROVIDE SOME WATER FOR ALL THOSE VERY SPECIAL CREATURES 
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I'VE MADE ONE AT GLEBE COTTAGE 
WELL LOOK AT THIS 
WHAT AN EXCAVATION ISN'T IT WONDERFUL 
WELCOME TO MY POND 
IT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY ENORMOUS 
AND IT REALLY IS QUITE DEEP 
AND ALL THE WAY ROUND IS THIS BROAD SHELF 
I WANTED A BIG BROAD SHELF SO I CAN PACK PLENTY OF PLANTS IN THERE 
AND THEN AT THIS END THERE'S THIS GRADUAL SLOPE HERE 
BEYOND IT IS GOING TO BE A GREAT BIG BOG GARDEN 
AND IT WILL CONSTANTLY BE FED BY ANY WATER THAT FLOWS OVER THE TOP 
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WE'VE GOT TO ENSURE THAT THE WATER LEVEL'S RIGHT 
THAT'S WHAT THIS PECULIAR DEVICE HERE IS FOR 
AND IT IS GIVING ME MY LEVEL 
AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON 
BECAUSE WE'RE ON A SLOPE NATURALLY THIS END'S REALLY HIGH 
ALL THIS WILL BE PROTRUDING FROM THE WATER 
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS USE THIS AS A REAL OPPORTUNITY 
AND BUILD UP A LITTLE WALL WITH STONE THAT WE'VE GOT LYING AROUND THE GARDEN 
AND I THINK THAT WILL REALLY HELP BLEND THE WHOLE POND IN WITH ALL THIS LOT HERE 
BUT FIRST OF ALL I'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT PROTECTING THE POND 
I'M USING OLD SACKS AND HESSIAN BETWEEN THE SOIL AND THE LINING 
TO PREVENT ANY SHARP STONES PUNCTURING THE BUTYL 
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL BUTYL LINER 
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE PUDDLED THE POND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT 
BUT IT WAS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO LEAK LARGE PARTS OF IT WERE JUST SOIL 
SO I'VE GONE FOR THIS IT'S NOT THE CHEAPEST OPTION 
IT'S QUITE EXPENSIVE BUT IT'S SUSTAINABLE 
IT CONTAINS LOTS OF NATURAL MATERIAL LOADS OF RUBBER 
AND IT'S GOING TO LAST A LIFETIME 
I THINK IT'S IDEAL BUT IT IS ENORMOUS AND HUGELY HEAVY 
CAN I ENLIST THE HELP OF TIM 
LET'S HAVE A GO 
TIM'S A GOOD FRIEND WHO'S BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO GIVE ME A HAND 
WE'VE HAD IT IN THE SUN TO WARM IT 
THAT MAKES IT MORE MALLEABLE 
AND WE'VE GOT QUITE A DEEP HOLE TO FILL IN 
IT'S ALWAYS BEST TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF GENEROSITY WHEN IT COMES TO ORDERING YOUR LINER 
YOU CAN ALWAYS TRIM OFF EXCESS WHEN THE POND'S FILLED 
BUT IF IT'S TOO SMALL YOU CAN'T ADD A BIT ON 
ISN'T IT EXCITING 
IT'S WONDERFUL IT'S BEGINNING TO FEEL LIKE A POND 
THE PLAN IS TO BUILD A ROCK WALL AT THE STEEP END OF THE POND 
WHILE TIM BUILDS THE WALL AT THE POND'S EDGE 
I'M READY FOR THE ALL IMPORTANT FILLING THE POND WITH WATER 
ARMED ONLY WITH A COUPLE OF HOSEPIPES A PLANT POT AND THE USE OF A NATURAL STREAM 
THIS IS MY HEATH ROBINSON MOMENT 
I HOPE IT'S GOING TO WORK 
I'M GOING TO ATTACH THIS HOSEPIPE TO THIS 
SO THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO GET A HEAD OF WATER 
AS SOON AS YOU CAN SORT OF FEEL IT PUSHING THROUGH THERE 
OOH 
RIGHT OVER THE TOP OF IT 
AND THEN DOWN UNDER HERE 
I'M USING THAT PLANT POT TO ACT AS A SORT OF FILTER 
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT ALL MUD AND STUFF IN THERE 
I'M GOING TO WEIGHT IT DOWN WITH THIS STONE TO KEEP IT IN POSITION 
THIS IS SUCH AN ASSET HAVING THIS WONDERFUL STREAM WATER THROUGH HERE 
IF YOU'VE GOT NO OPTION OTHER THAN USING TAP WATER 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO WAIT A WHILE FOR THOSE CHEMICALS TO DISPERSE 
BUT IF YOU KNOW YOU'RE MAKING A POND THEN YOU CAN BE COLLECTING RAINWATER 
HEAVEN KNOWS IT RAINS ENOUGH DOESN'T IT 
I WONDER IF IT'S WORKING TIM 
ANYTHING HAPPENING 
WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY 
WOO HOO 
TECHNOLOGY INSTALLED THE POND STEADILY FILLS UP 
AFTER AN AFTERNOON'S GARDENING 
I CAN'T RESIST TAKING A LAST LOOK AT THE RESULTS OF OUR HANDIWORK 
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK 
QUITE A SUCCESS 
THE WATER'S ALMOST UP TO THE RIGHT LEVEL NOW 
AND IT REALLY LOOKS PRETTY GOOD 
I THINK WE'VE GOT BOTH SIDES JUST ABOUT LEVEL TOO 
THIS WONDERFUL DEPTH OF WATER IN HERE 
AND THE REALLY EXCITING BIT'S YET TO COME 
THE REASON FOR BUILDING THIS POND IS NOT THE ENGINEERING PART IT'S NOT THE CONSTRUCTION 
IT'S ALL THESE FANTASTIC PLANTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO PUT IN HERE 
AND THIS WONDERFUL HABITAT THAT WE'RE GOING TO CREATE 
I THINK IT'S JUST GOING TO BE TOTALLY BEAUTIFUL 
I'M SO LOOKING FORWARD TO IT 
IT'S REALLY TRUE THOUGH ISN'T IT FOR ALL US GARDENERS 
THE MOST EXCITING PART OF ANY PROJECT 
IS ACTUALLY THE PLANTS AND PUTTING THEM IN 
WELL AS WELL AS THESE FREEBIES THAT WE'VE GOT FROM VARIOUS PLACES 
IT'S TIME TO INTRODUCE SOME NEW PLANTS TO THIS AREA COMPLETELY NEW TO BERRYFIELDS 
AND IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE JUST HOW THIS AREA'S GOING TO GROW UP REALLY 
ALL THESE WILLOWS EVERYTHING ALTHOUGH THEY'VE BEEN CUT BACK NOW 
THAT'S JUST TO INDUCE THEM TO MAKE LOADS OF LOVELY NEW GROWTH 
AND IT'S GOING TO BECOME A REAL THICKET IN HERE WITH ALL THESE BRANCHING PLANTS 
SO THERE'LL BE A LOT OF SHADE ABOUT I'M GOING TO START WITH THIS LOVELY LOVELY 
HONESTY 
IT'S LUNARIA REDIVIVA AND IT'S GOING TO MAKE NICE LUSH SORT OF 
HEART SHAPED FOLIAGE AND THEN LATER IT WILL FLOWER 
WITH THESE QUITE TALL HEADS OF PALE LILACCY FLOWERS 
REALLY EXTREMELY PRETTY AND AFTERWARDS IS THE MOST EXCITING PART 
BECAUSE THAT IS WHEN THE FLOWERS GIVE WAY TO THESE ELLIPTICAL SEED HEADS 
BECAUSE THE SEED HEADS ON ALL HONESTIES ARE GORGEOUS 
THE NEXT PLANT I WANT TO PUT IN 
RED CAMPION NOW THIS IS A PLANT WHICH IS FAMILIAR TO EVERYBODY 
BECAUSE EVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF TOWNS THIS PLANT SURVIVES 
I'M GOING TO SCATTER THEM AROUND THESE LUNARIA 
JUST HERE AND THERE VERY VERY ACCOMMODATING 
TREMENDOUSLY EASY SORT OF 
PLANTS TO GROW 
THE THIRD PLANT I WANT TO USE IS THIS MYOSOTIS A FORGET ME NOT BUT IT'S SYLVATICA 
IT'S A WOODLAND FORGET ME NOT 
AND I REALLY THINK IT'LL ENJOY LIFE IN THE SHADE HERE 
SO THIS WILL SEED AROUND SO WILL THIS SILENE 
THE WHOLE LOT WILL SORT OF MERGE 
AND THROUGH PLANTING A FEW OF THESE OVER HERE TOO 
WE'RE GOING TO JOIN THIS PLANTING INTO THE SORT OF BIGGER AREA 
SO WHILE I'M BUSY PLANTING ALL THESE WONDERFUL THINGS 
IT'S TIME TO SEE WHAT JOE'S BEEN UP TO 
EXPANDING HIS HORIZONS ON HIS NEW ALLOTMENT 
I GOT UP NICE AND EARLY THIS MORNING I'M HERE ALL DAY AT THE ALLOTMENT 
AND THIS AFTERNOON CATH AND THE KIDS ARE COMING UP AND THEY HAVEN'T SEEN IT 
SINCE IT'S BEEN SCRAPED SO THAT'S GONNA BE INTERESTING 
THIS IS KEN HELLO KEN 
WAIT WAIT I DON'T WANT YOU DOWN HERE WHY 
WHY I'VE GOT SOMETHING IN STORE FOR YOU 
I I CAN'T GET THE WORD OUT MY MOUTH 
YES YEAH 
IT WASN'T MY IDEA IT WAS MY GRANDSON'S BEN 
REALLY WELL HE CAME DOWN TO SEE YOURS YEAH 
AND HE GOT INSPIRED DID HE COULDN'T HOLD HIMSELF BACK 
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE 
WELL YOU'VE GOT ONE OF YOUR OWN NOW SEE 
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ARE YOU GONNA PLANT IT UP YOU KNOW MAYBE A RAISED BED 
NO WHAT I WAS GONNA DO 
WHAT I WANTED TO DO 
IS HAVE A COMPETITION ON GROWING THE LARGEST SUNFLOWER 
THE LARGEST SUNFLOWER 
GET SOME OF THE KIDS INVOLVED MY KIDS ARE COMING UP THIS AFTERNOON I KNOW 
I'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR THEM OH YEAH YEAH 
I'M NOT TELLING YOU WHAT IT IS IS IT A WOODEN TRIANGLE I WOULDN'T DO THAT WOULD I 
I'VE GOT TO BE TRUTHFUL I'M SO PLEASED YOU'VE COME ON HERE 
WHY BECAUSE 
FROM WHAT IT WAS TO WHAT IT IS IS UNBELIEVABLE 
WELL THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE ALL THE SPARE PLOTS ARE NOW TAKEN UP 
THERE'S LIKE ANOTHER FIVE NEWCOMERS OR SOMETHING WE'VE A FEW MORE 
A FEW MORE BODIES THAT MAKES IT GOOD I'LL CATCH UP LATER 
WHAT DO YOU THINK SOUNDS GREAT 
I'M GETTING IN SOME JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES FIRST OF ALL 
SO I'VE DUG THAT WHOLE AREA OVER 
AND TAKEN OUT AS MANY OF THE WEEDS AS I CAN 
PUT A LOAD OF COMPOST AT THE BOTTOM DUG OUT THIS TRENCH WHICH IS ABOUT FIVE INCHES DEEP 
AND THESE ARE THE ONES CLEAVE GAVE ME 
AND THEY'RE LOOKING VERY NICE 
THEY'RE VERY NICE ACTUALLY I'VE GOT ABOUT TEN OF THEM 
AND THIS IS THE BIT THAT YOU ACTUALLY EAT 
AND THEY'RE A LOVELY PLANT 
THEY GET TO ABOUT SIX OR EIGHT FEET AND THEY'VE GOT A SMALL SUNFLOWER FLOWERS ON THE TOP OF THEM 
ONCE THEY'RE IN THE GROUND THEY MULTIPLY 
MIGHT GET TEN OR SOMETHING OUT OF THEM BY THE END OF THE YEAR 
BUT ONCE THEY'RE IN THEY'RE IN FOREVER PRETTY MUCH THEY'RE PERENNIAL 
SO THEY COME UP EVERY YEAR I'M SPACING THEM WHAT'S THAT ABOUT A FOOT APART 
DO YOU REGRET ROTOVATING IT NO I DON'T REGRET ROTOVATING IT AT ALL 
IT WAS THE ONLY THING I COULD HAVE DONE AND LOOK YOU KNOW 
IT MAKES THE SOIL WORKABLE I KNOW I'VE GOT TO WEED BUT I'D HAVE HAD TO DO THAT ANYWAY 
THE PROBLEM WAS BEFORE I ROTOVATED 
RIGHT BUT THEY WERE TWENTY TIMES BIGGER THAN THAT THEY WERE HUGE LUMPS OF CLAY 
O. K. THAT HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE DIGGER I COULDN'T GET A FORK OR A SPADE IN THERE 
I COULDN'T WORK THAT SOIL AT ALL I COULD HAVE BEEN HERE FOR TWO MONTHS 
JUST HAND DIGGING TAKING OUT EVERY WEED AS I GO ALONG 
THAT'S IT THE ARTICHOKES ARE IN THE GROUND NOW SO I CAN MOVE ON TO THE POTATOES 
THE ONES I'VE BEEN CHITTING AT HOME CAN FINALLY GO IN THE GROUND 
FIRST ONES GONNA GO IN SWIFT HAS TO BE LOOK AT THAT 
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFULLY CHITTED 
NOW THIS IS PRETTY DISEASE RESISTANT 
WHICH IS WHY I'M USING IT 
AND IT ALSO TASTES GREAT TOO 
I'M SPACING THESE ABOUT TWELVE INCHES APART 
I'M NOT MEASURING THEM OUT I'M JUST PLACING THEM 
AND THEN WITH THE MAIN CROP THEY GO ABOUT FIFTEEN INCHES APART 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LONGER TIME TO GROW 
SO THEY NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE SPACE 
I SHOULD BE DIGGING THESE UP ABOUT MID JULY OR SOMETHING 
NOW THAT IS WELL CHITTED DON'T LAUGH IT'S NOT A JOKE 
YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE IT'S GOT A REALLY STRONG GROWTH 
IT HASN'T GOT TOO LEGGY IT HASN'T TAKEN OFF AND SPROUTED AWAY 
YOU SEE THERE'S A LOT OF ENERGY IN THERE A LOT OF GROWTH JUST WAITING TO HAPPEN 
SO AS SOON AS I PUT THAT IN THE GROUND AND IT COMES INTO CONTACT WITH SOIL AND MOISTURE 
IT SHOULD ALL GO BALLISTIC WHICH IS THE POINT 
I'M GONNA USE SOME OF THIS PELLETED CHICKEN MANURE 
JUST AS A GENERAL FERTILISER COS THIS SOIL HASN'T BEEN FED FOR YEARS 
I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT WELL IT HASN'T 
SO I'M JUST GOING TO LIGHTLY SPRINKLE IT ON TO THE SOIL THAT I'VE DUG OUT 
NOT ON TO THE POTATOES THEMSELVES JUST ON TO THE SOIL 
SO THAT WHEN I BACK FILL 
IT JUST GOES IN AS A GENERAL FEED AND GIVES THEM A REALLY GOOD START 
CATH AND THE KIDS ARE COMING UP SOON SHOULD BE NICE TO SEE THEM 
THE KIDS HAVE THEIR OWN TRIANGLE DOWN THERE TO PLANT WHATEVER THEY WANT IN 
AND CATH'S GONNA HELP ME PUT IN A RATHER EXOTIC FRUIT 
I THINK EVERYONE THINKS I'M A LITTLE MAD HERE ALREADY 
BUT IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT THEY THINK OF THESE 
SOME MORE EXCITING STUFF FROM JOE'S ALLOTMENT LATER 
BUT FIRST LOOK I CAN'T RESIST DOING THIS 
WHEN YOUR BULBS ARE SPENT YOU KNOW AND THE FLOWERS ARE LOOKING TATTY 
JUST GET A SHARP PAIR OF SECATEURS 
OR EVEN A PAIR OF SCISSORS AND TAKE OFF THOSE SPENT FLOWER HEADS 
COS OTHERWISE THEY'LL TRY AND SET SEED 
YOU CAN DO THAT WITH ANY DECORATIVE BULBS AT ALL 
BUT THE EXCEPTION IS ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT TO SELF SOW 
THINGS LIKE BLUEBELLS OR SNOWDROPS THAT KIND OF THING 
BUT I WANT TO PLANT SOME BULBS NOW 
AND ERM THESE ARE FOR THE LONG BORDER 
IT'S LILIUM LANCIFOLIUM OTHERWISE KNOWN AS TIGER LILY 
AND THE REASON I'M NOT PLANTING THEM DIRECTLY 
IS BECAUSE I WANT TO SORT OF STEAL A MARCH IF YOU LIKE 
IF I JUST POP ONE BULB 
IN EACH OF THESE FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL POTS I'VE HALF FILLED IT 
AND I'M JUST GOING TO TUCK THAT IN 
AND FILL UP TO THE TOP 
JUST TO THE TOP OF THE BULB 
NO FURTHER THAN THAT SO YOU CAN STILL SEE 
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF THAT BULB EMERGING 
AND AS THEY START TO SHOOT AND GROW 
I'M JUST GOING TO TOP THEM UP 
SO CONSTANTLY CONSTANTLY THE SOIL LEVEL IS THE SAME AS THE SHOOT ITSELF 
AND THEN WHEN THEY GET TO THE TOP OF THE POTS IT'LL BE TIME TO TAKE THEM OUTSIDE 
NOW THE REASON I WANT TO DO IT IN THIS WAY 
IS ERM IT'S CRAFTY REALLY 
YOU KNOW THOSE GAPS THAT APPEAR IN YOUR SUMMER BORDER AND YOU THINK 
WHAT AM I GONNA PUT THERE COS IT'S TOO LATE TO PLONK A PERENNIAL IN 
THESE WILL DO TO STICK IN JUST WHERE THESE GAPS APPEAR 
IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING THAT LILIES ARE ACTUALLY POISONOUS TO CATS 
IT'S THE POLLEN SO IF YOU LIKE THEM BOTH JUST BE CAREFUL 
JUST BE AWARE OF IT 
BUT LILIES THEMSELVES HAVE SOME AFFLICTIONS 
AND I SUPPOSE THE VERY WORST ONE IS LILY BEETLE 
AND ERM DESPITE THIS COLD SPRING 
THE JOHN INNES CENTRE HAS ALREADY BEEN RECEIVING REPORTS 
THAT THE DREADED LILY BEETLE IS ON THE PROWL 
SO WE WENT TO VISIT IAN BEDFORD AT THE JOHN INNES CENTRE 
WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT THEM 
LILIOCERIS LILII COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE RED OR THE SCARLET LILY BEETLE 
ORIGINATED FROM SOUTHERN EUROPE OR ASIA WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE WHERE 
BUT IT FIRST APPEARED IN THE U. K. 
PRIOR TO THE SECOND WORLD WAR THAT COLONY KEPT A VERY LOW PROFILE 
IT WASN'T UNTIL ALMOST FIFTY YEARS LATER 
THAT THE LILY BEETLE NUMBERS STARTED TO TAKE OFF 
OVER THE PAST DECADE THEY HAVE SPREAD AT A TREMENDOUS RATE 
LILY BEETLES ARE NOW FOUND IN EVERY COUNTY 
IN ENGLAND THEY'VE RECENTLY BEEN RECORDED IN SCOTLAND 
IRELAND AND WALES 
LILY BEETLES ARE EXTREMELY GOOD FLYERS 
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY CAN DETECT A LILY PLANT 
AT THIRTY YARDS WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING ANY VISUAL CONTACT 
WE'RE FINDING THAT IT'S THE CHEMICALS GIVEN OFF BY THE PLANT 
WHEN IT IS FIRST STARTING TO PRODUCE NEW GROWTH 
THIS IS WHAT THE LILY BEETLES APPEAR TO HOME IN ON 
THE ADULT LILY BEETLE SPENDS THE WINTER UNDERGROUND 
THEY EMERGE IN LATE SPRING 
TO COINCIDE WITH THE NEW GROWTH FROM THEIR FOOD PLANTS 
WHICH IS JUST THE LILIUM SPECIES AND THEIR HYBRIDS AND FRITILLARIA 
SO UNLESS THE LILY BEETLES ARE CONTROLLED AT AN EARLY STAGE 
THAT PLANT WILL NOT GROW TO PRODUCE DECENT BUDS AND FLOWER 
IF THEY ARE LEFT UNATTENDED THEY'LL DEFOLIATE IT THEN MOVE ONTO THE DEVELOPING FLOWER BUDS 
THEY'LL EVEN EAT THE PETALS ON PLANTS THAT HAVE GONE INTO BLOOM 
SO THEY ARE A MAJOR PEST OF LILIES 
BUT THE FACT THEY ARE SO SPECIALIST MEANS THEY'RE NO DANGER TO OTHER PLANTS 
SOME OF YOU WHO'VE TRIED TO REMOVE THE RED LILY BEETLES BY HAND 
MAY HAVE NOTICED A STRANGE NOISE THEY EMIT 
IT'S ACTUALLY A CHIRP 
IT IS QUITE AMAZING FOR SUCH A LITTLE BEETLE TO MAKE SUCH A LOUD CHIRPING NOISE 
WE'RE NOT REALLY SURE WHY IT DOES IT 
IT'S PROBABLY A WAY OF PUTTING OFF PREDATORS THAT MAY HAVE PICKED UP A BEETLE 
THE OTHER INTERESTING PHENOMENON THAT THE RED LILY BEETLE HAS 
IS THAT IT CAN SEND OUT THESE ALARM PHEROMONES 
YOU SPOT A LILY BEETLE ON ONE PLANT YOU GO TO COLLECT IT 
AS SOON AS YOU GET NEAR IT SENDS OUT ALARM PHEROMONES TO OTHER BEETLES 
AND OUT OF THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE YOU SEE ALL THESE THINGS DROPPING TO THE FLOOR 
AND YOU LOOK ROUND TO FIND OUT WHERE THEY ARE AND THEY'RE VANISHED 
BECAUSE THEY'RE NO LONGER THE BRIGHT RED THINGS YOU SEE ON THE LEAVES 
AS THEY FALL DOWN THEY TWIST LAND ON THEIR BACKS 
AND ALL YOU CAN SEE THEN IS THE LOWER SIDE OF THEM WHICH IS CAMOUFLAGED AGAINST THE SOIL 
IF YOU GO IN YOUR GARDEN AND SPOT A RED LILY BEETLE ON YOUR PLANTS REMOVE IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
THEN SEARCH THE PLANT FOR TINY ORANGEY RED EGGS THAT WILL BE LAID ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE LEAVES 
LOOK FOR THESE HORRIBLE SLIMY GRUBS THAT MIGHT BE UNDER THE LEAVES 
REMOVE THOSE BY CUTTING THE LEAVES OFF OR RUNNING YOUR FINGER DOWN AND SQUASHING THEM 
HOWEVER THEY HAVE A DISGUSTING HABIT AS THEY FEED THEY COVER THEMSELVES WITH THEIR OWN EXCREMENT 
FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW ABOUT CONTROLLING LILY BEETLES BY HAND 
THIS MAKES THE TASK OF SQUASHING THESE THINGS EXTREMELY DISTASTEFUL 
THE OTHER THING YOU CAN DO IS GROW THEM IN POTS 
AT THE END OF EACH YEAR YOU CAN DIG UP THE BULBS THROW AWAY THE SOIL THAT THOSE LILIES HAVE GROWN IN 
WHICH MAY HAVE OVERWINTERING ADULTS IN AND RE POT THEM INTO FRESH SOIL FOR THE NEXT YEAR 
YOU COULD USE A CHEMICAL OPTION AND THERE ARE A FEW ACTIVE INGREDIENTS THAT WORK ON LILY BEETLES 
PRODUCTS THAT ARE BIFENTHRIN BASED OR THIACLOPRID BASED ARE EFFECTIVE 
MY RECOMMENDATION AND I DO GROW LILIES IS NOT TO GROW TOO MANY 
AND KEEP A VERY GOOD EYE ON THEM 
PARTICULARLY IN THE SPRING DAILY GO OUT AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANY ADULTS THAT HAVE EMERGED 
AND ARE SITTING THERE MATING OR LAYING EGGS 
JUST INSPECT THOSE PLANTS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AND REMOVE WHATEVER YOU FIND 
THAT WAY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THE PLANTS THROUGH TO FLOWERING AND HAVE A LOVELY DISPLAY OF LILIES 
WE'LL KEEP YOU APPRAISED OF THE PROGRESS OF OUR LILIES JUST AS WE WILL EVERYTHING ELSE WE'RE DOING 
NOW THE COSMOS TRIAL I SUPPOSE THE TRIAL DOESN'T START OFFICIALLY UNTIL YOU SEE YOUR FIRST FLOWERS 
THAT'S WHEN WE WANT YOU TO MAKE A NOTE DEAD HEAD THOSE COSMOS RIGHT THROUGH THE SUMMER 
AND MAKE A NOTE OF WHEN YOUR FINAL FLOWER DISAPPEARS 
HOW ARE OURS GETTING ON WE'RE GROANING UNDER COSMOS AT THE MOMENT 
THESE GUYS WERE SOWN A MONTH AGO AND ARE DOING REALLY WELL 
JUST ONE MORE LOT TO PRICK OUT AND WE'RE READY TO GO 
RIGHT WELL THEY LOOK REALLY STRONG THEY LOOK BRILLIANT 
I'M JUST GOING TO PRICK OUT THESE COSMOS 
FIRST THING I NEED TO DO IS FILL THIS TRAY WITH SOIL 
THIS IS JUST GOOD POTTING COMPOST SO 
LET'S FILL UP ALL THE TRAYS 
AND THEN YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE ALL THE TRAYS ARE FULL TO THE TOP 
YOU DON'T WANT TO SKIMP ON THAT 
I'M JUST GOING TO TAMP IT DOWN A BIT 
NOW I'M GOING TO START PRICKING OUT 
THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT PRICKING OUT 
ONE IS THERE'S TWO TYPES OF LEAVES THERE'S SEED OR BABY LEAVES WHICH YOU CAN SEE HERE 
AND THEN THERE ARE THE TRUE LEAVES IN THE MIDDLE 
THE BABY LEAVES ARE JUST THERE TO PROVIDE A LOT OF ENERGY AND FOOD TO GET GERMINATION GOING 
AND IT'S NOT SO CRUCIAL IF YOU DAMAGE THE BABY LEAVES 
BUT IT IS A LOT MORE PROBLEMATIC IF YOU DAMAGE THE TRUE LEAVES 
SO YOU ALWAYS PRICK OUT HOLDING THE BAY LEAVES 
NEVER THE STEM NEVER THE TRUE LEAF ALWAYS THE BABY LEAF 
TAKE THE BABY LEAF IN HAND AND THEN WITH A DIBBER OR A PENCIL 
UNTIL YOU CAN KIND OF START PUSHING UP 
AND VERY SLOWLY START PULLING THE PLANT OUT 
NOW IF THERE'S A GOOD ROOT SYSTEM WHICH THERE IS ON THIS ONE 
THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF THE PLANT WITH THE DIBBER UNDERNEATH LIKE THAT 
THEN PUT IT DOWN HERE 
MAKE A HOLE 
DROP IT IN 
AND CAREFULLY TAMP DOWN THE SOIL 
SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE A BIT RUTHLESS WITH YOUR SEEDLINGS 
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH AT THIS STAGE THEY'RE NOT TAKING UP MUCH SPACE 
AT THIS STAGE THEY TAKE UP MORE SPACE THEN IN THE NEXT STAGE THEY TAKE UP EVEN MORE SPACE 
SO YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER HOW MUCH ROOM YOU'VE GOT 
AND WITH THAT IN MIND ONLY GO FOR THE STRONGEST SEEDLINGS 
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR HEALTHY SEEDLINGS 
AND ANYTHING THAT'S A BIT WEAK DON'T BOTHER WITH IT 
BECAUSE IT'LL JUST STRUGGLE AT THE NEXT STAGE AND THE STAGE AFTERWARDS 
THE DELPHINIUMS THAT MONTY PLANTED ARE GROWING STRONG 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE ORGANIC SLUG PELLETS HAVE DONE THEIR JOB AS ALL THE PELLETS HAVE BEEN EATEN UP 
THE PLANTS SHOULD NOW GROW ON TROUBLE FREE 
ALSO THE CARROTS MONTY SOWED HAVE BROKEN THROUGH AND NO LONGER NEED THE PROTECTION OF THE CLOCHE 
SO WE'RE REMOVING IT SO THEY GET THE FULL BENEFIT OF THE SUN 
STILL TO COME IN TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME 
JOE WILL BE AT HIS ALLOTMENT PLANTING SOME EXOTIC BERRIES 
WE'LL BE HAVING A LOOK AT WHAT GEOFF HAMILTON WAS UP TO TWELVE YEARS AGO AT BARNSDALE 
AND WE'LL BE FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST OPULENT AND EXOTIC OF COTTAGE GARDEN PLANTS THE PEONY 
WELL I'M IN THE COTTAGE GARDEN 
AND JUST LOOK AT THIS 
IT'S AN EXQUISITE ERYTHRONIUM 
THESE WONDERFUL MARBLE LEAVES AND THESE ELEGANT BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS 
WE ONLY PLANTED THAT LAST YEAR IT'S DOING REALLY WELL 
BUT I WANT TO TACKLE SOME OF THESE GERANIUMS 
THESE GERANIUMS 
HAVE REALLY I SUPPOSE THEY'VE RUN AMOK REALLY 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE THE GERANIUMS THAT ARE IN THERE THEY FELL IN NEAT CLUMPS 
BUT HERE THIS OXONIANUM HAS REALLY REALLY BECOME QUITE RAMPANT 
THE THING ABOUT A COTTAGE GARDEN IS THAT EVERY INCH OF SPACE IS VALUABLE 
IT'S ALL GOT TO BE WORKING ALL THE TIME 
AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS RECYCLE THEM THEY'LL BE PERFECT PLANTS FOR THE NEW NECTAR BORDER 
AND THEY'LL MAKE THIS WONDERFUL SORT OF IN BETWEEN KIND OF COVER 
I'M GOING TO BE QUITE BRUTAL NOW I'VE DUG UNDERNEATH 
AND I'M GOING TO CHOP DOWN AND LIFT SOME OF THESE LUMPS OUT 
THE FORGET ME NOTS HAVE CROWDED OUT THIS LOVELY LITTLE VIOLA 
SO I'M REMOVING SOME OF THEM AND I'LL MOVE THEM TO A DIFFERENT PART OF THE GARDEN 
WE'LL BE ABLE TO PUT ALL SORTS OF EXCITING THINGS IN THERE 
BUT ANOTHER THING I WANT TO DO TODAY IS SOW SOME VEGETABLES FOR THE COTTAGE GARDEN 
SO FAR WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY VEGETABLES IN HERE 
YET TRADITIONALLY IN THE COTTAGE GARDEN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN PRIMARY 
I WANT TO INTRODUCE THAT ELEMENT INTO OUR COTTAGE GARDEN 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'D LOVE TO GROW IS SOMETHING WITH BIG LEAVES SOMETHING BIG AND BRIGHT 
THE FIRST THING I WANT TO PUT IN IS THIS CHARD BRIGHT LIGHTS' 
CHARD IS SUCH AN INCREDIBLY USEFUL VEGETABLE 
BECAUSE YOU CAN EAT IT RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH THE YEAR 
WHAT'S MORE IT'S ALWAYS GOOD LOOKING 
SO PUKKA VEGETABLES ARE WELCOME IN OUR COTTAGE GARDEN 
THIS IS ONE CALLED BRIGHT LIGHTS 
I'M JUST GOING TO SOW IT INTO THIS MODULE TRAY NORMALLY YOU MIGHT SOW THEM INTO A SEED TRAY 
OR OF COURSE PLANT THEM DIRECT INTO THE GROUND 
I WANT NICE ESTABLISHED PLANTS TO GO IN SO WE CAN CHOOSE EXACTLY WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO GO 
THEY'RE QUITE BIG SEEDS I'M GOING TO PUT JUST A COUPLE INTO EACH MODULE 
SO THEY WILL GROW ON BRILLIANTLY WELL 
AS WELL AS BIG LEAVES 
WE'VE VERY FEW BIG LEAVES IN HERE APART FROM THE ARUM AND THE CRAMBE 
I'D LOVE TO INTRODUCE A NOTE OF VERTICALITY INTO THE COTTAGE GARDEN 
WE REALLY NEED SOME HEIGHT IN HERE 
SO I'M GOING TO GROW SOME CLIMBING BEANS 
THIS IS SUCH A PRETTY BEAN 
IT'S CALLED 
BORLOTTO LINGUA DI FUOCO AND I THINK IT MEANS FIRE TONGUE 
AND LOOK AT THEM THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE CHOCOLATE EASTER EGGS 
SO BEAUTIFULLY STRIPED 
THIS IS A BEAN THAT GROWS TO ABOUT SIX FEET TALL 
I'M JUST GOING TO PUT ONE BEAN TO EACH OF THESE CELLS 
UP TO ABOUT ITS OWN DEPTH IN COMPOST THERE 
THEY'LL STAY IN HERE UNTIL WE HAVE ESTABLISHED PLANTS THAT CAN FEND FOR THEMSELVES WHEN THEY GO OUT 
THE THIRD THING I WANT TO PUT IN IS THIS PURPLE PODDED PEA 
IT'S AN OLD HERITAGE VARIETY TRULY BEAUTIFUL 
ABOUT MY SORT OF HEIGHT MUCH PRETTIER THAN ME 
WITH THESE BIG PURPLE PODS 
IT'S A REAL DELIGHT 
AND AGAIN 
I'M JUST GOING TO PUT ONE SEED INTO THAT MODULE 
I THINK THOSE ARE EXACTLY WHAT THIS COTTAGE GARDEN NEEDS 
LAST YEAR I MOVED SOME PEONIES HERE AND THEY'RE REALLY GETTING GOING 
SOME OF THEM ARE FULL OF BUDS TOO 
PEONIES ARE TYPICALLY COTTAGE GARDEN PLANTS 
IF YOU WANT SOME THE VERY BEST THING IS TO GO AND SEE THEM GROWING WHEN THEY'RE IN FULL FLOWER 
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE DID 
VISITED CLAIRE AUSTIN'S NURSERY IN SHROPSHIRE 
SHE REALLY IS THE PEONY QUEEN 
PEONIES GO BACK GENERATIONS THEY WERE GROWN IN MONASTERIES FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES 
BUT THESE WERE THE COTTAGE PEONY THAT EVERYBODY WILL HAVE SEEN 
IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE FRENCH TOOK THEM ON BOARD 
AND DECIDED TO START BREEDING THEM 
SO THEY DEVELOPED THEM FROM A VERY SIMPLE PLANT 
INTO THIS GLORIOUS ARRAY WE HAVE TODAY 
THEY ARE JUST SO OVER THE TOP 
THEY ARE SO BIG AND BLOUSY AND BEAUTIFUL 
THIS IS LARGO IT'S A JAPANESE PEONY 
BUT IT DEMONSTRATES HOW VARIABLE PEONIES CAN BE 
THOSE ARE GUARD PETALS THOSE ARE THE OUTER GUARD PETALS 
AND THESE ARE THE CREAMY PETALOIDS 
BUT IT ALSO IN SOME CASES HAS THESE INNER PETALS 
WHICH DON'T OCCUR IN EVERY PLANT 
BUT THEY JUST ADD A DIFFERENT DIMENSION TO THE OVERALL BLOUSY FLOWERINESS OF THE PLANT 
IT'S A MOST MAGNIFICENT SPECIMEN 
FOR JUST FOCUSING YOUR ATTENTION IN A BORDER 
A LOT OF PEOPLE DO TEND TO ASK 
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TREE PEONY AND A HERBACEOUS PEONY 
TREE PEONIES ARE ESSENTIALLY WOODY OR SHRUBBY PEONIES 
AND WE HAVE THIS WONDERFUL UPPER GROWTH 
AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK UNDERNEATH YOU GET A WOODY STEM 
WITH NEW GROWTH ON THE TOP 
THE WOODY STEM DOESN'T DIE BACK IN WINTER AND THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE 
WHEN IT COMES TO LOOKING AFTER ALL TYPES OF PEONY THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE 
THEY ALL NEED VERY WELL DRAINED SOIL THEY LIKE FULL SUN 
BUT THEY CAN GROW IN SEMI SHADE 
AS LONG AS THEY HAVE WATER IN THE SPRING TO FORM THE BUDS 
FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS AND ABANDONED 
THEY ARE VERY LONG LIVING AND VERY EASY TO GROW ONCE ESTABLISHED 
THIS IS LAURA DESSERT 
IT'S MORE TRADITIONAL IN STYLE 
IT'S A DOUBLE BUT AGAIN IT HAS THE WHITE GUARD PETALS 
MUCH MORE PAPERY 
AND THE INNER PETALOIDS FORM A BEAUTIFUL DOME 
WHICH AT FIRST ARE INCREDIBLY YELLOW 
AND THEN GRADUALLY FADE TO ALMOST WHITE 
MORE MODERN ONES 
AND IT'S INCREDIBLY SCENTED 
IT'S LONG BEEN THOUGHT THAT PEONIES ARE DIFFICULT TO MOVE RUBBISH 
I HAVE MOVED HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF PEONIES 
AND WE HAVE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH THEM ESTABLISHING THEMSELVES 
THEY CAN TAKE THREE YEARS FLOWER PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT MORE 
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO PLANT THEM AT THE RIGHT DEPTH THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WITH MOVING PEONIES 
WITH THE HERBACEOUS PEONY YOU MUST NOT PLANT THEM DEEPER THAN AN INCH BELOW THE SOIL 
IF YOU PLANT THEM ANY DEEPER THEY CAN FAIL TO FLOWER 
TREE PEONIES NEED TO BE PLANTED DEEPER BECAUSE THEY ARE MOST OFTEN GRAFTED 
AND TO FORM THEIR OWN ROOTS THEY NEED DEEPER PLANTING 
I ALWAYS THINK WITH THESE BIG GLAMOROUS PLANTS 
WHETHER IT'S A PEONY OR AN IRIS THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANT THEM ALL YEAR ROUND 
THEY'D BECOME VULGAR 
YOU'D SAY OH IT'S ANOTHER PEONY 
SO I LOVE THE FACT THAT THEY'VE GOT THIS BURST OF GLORY 
A BIT LIKE A BALL GOWN SO YOU DON'T WEAR YOUR BALL GOWN ALL YEAR 
YOU JUST HAVE IT FOR THAT ONE GREAT EVENT 
AND THAT'S WHAT PEONIES ARE ABOUT 
WELL THESE PEONIES THAT WERE TRANSPLANTED LAST YEAR 
REALLY ARE DOING TREMENDOUSLY WELL 
YOU COULDN'T HAVE MORE BEAUTIFUL FOLIAGE COULD YOU AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THAN PEONIES 
AND THESE HAVE GOT FAT FLOWER BUDS COMING 
AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE'VE FOLLOWED CLAIRE'S ADVICE 
AND WHEN WE WERE REPLANTING WE MADE SURE THAT THIS PEONY WASN'T BURIED 
IT WENT TO JUST THE SAME SORT OF LEVEL THAT IT HAD BEEN AT BEFORE 
BUT SOME OF THOSE PEONY BLOOMS ARE SO BIG AND HEAVY 
THAT PEONIES OFTEN COULD DO WITH A BIT OF HELP A BIT OF SUPPORT 
BUT I DON'T WANT TO USE ANYTHING TOO FORMAL 
SO I'M JUST USING A FEW TWIGGY PEA STICKS HERE 
I'M JUST GOING TO WEAVE THEM AROUND THE CLUMP 
RIGHT THE WAY ROUND 
AND THEY SHOULD REALLY DO THE JOB OF SUPPORTING THOSE BLOOMS 
AND I SUPPOSE THEY'LL FLOWER UP ABOUT HERE SOMEWHERE 
SO IF I FEEL THESE ARE A BIT OBTRUSIVE AT THAT STAGE 
I CAN JUST GO ROUND AND SNIP THEM 
SO THEY DON'T SHOW BUT THEY'RE STILL DOING THE JOB 
WELL I SUPPOSE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS 
OF ANY COTTAGE GARDEN 
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BED BY THE HOUSE 
IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT COS YOU'RE IN AND OUT OF THAT FRONT DOOR ALL THE TIME 
AND IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE A RICH ARRAY OF PLANTS THERE 
THE IRISES THAT WE'VE GOT IN HERE ARE DOING BRILLIANTLY WELL 
BUT I WANT TO ADD COLOUR FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR TOO 
AND SOMETHING REALLY COTTAGE Y. 
SO I'M GOING TO PLANT SOME OF THESE HOLLYHOCKS 
I MEAN IF ANYTHING IS A TRADITIONAL COTTAGE GARDEN PLANT 
ALL THOSE IMAGES THERE THEY ARE 
THESE GIANT HOLLYHOCKS I'M GOING TO PUT A COUPLE IN THERE 
SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ACTUALLY OBSCURE THE WINDOW 
BUT THEY'LL GROW RIGHT UP THERE 
WE COULD HAVE ANOTHER I THINK ANOTHER ONE FURTHER DOWN THERE 
AND THEN I WANT TO ADD HERE AND THERE 
SOME OF THESE BEAUTIFUL PERENNIAL WALLFLOWERS 
THIS IS ONE CALLED HECTOR'S GATEPOST 
AND I THINK I'D LIKE TO PUT IT DOWN HERE 
IN SOME OF THESE SPACES 
SO IT'S STILL IN FULL SUN 
BEAUTIFUL COLOURS THESE I THINK 
AND LOVELY WITH THE RED BRICK OF THE HOUSE 
I LOVE THIS COMBINATION OF ORANGE AND PURPLE 
AND IT GOES SO WELL WITH THOSE IRISES 
NOW YOU CAN SEE THIS IS REALLY CRUNCHY SOIL IN HERE 
AND IT'S IDEAL IT'S POOR SOIL 
AND IT'S QUITE ALKALINE 
PROBABLY FROM THE LIME MORTAR FROM THESE WALLS 
THESE ARE GOING TO GROW TO A TERRIFIC HEIGHT 
I REMEMBER MY MUM TALKING ABOUT A HOUSE WHERE SHE LIVED AS A LITTLE GIRL IN FOLKESTONE 
INCREDIBLY DRY SOIL JUST THIS SORT OF SITE 
VERY VERY ALKALINE 
AND SHE TALKED ABOUT HANGING OUT OF THE BEDROOM WINDOWS 
AND BEING ABLE TO TOUCH THE TOP OF THE HOLLYHOCKS 
NOW THOSE SHOULD REALLY GET GOING THERE 
AND I WANT TO PLANT THESE WALLFLOWERS 
PERENNIAL WALLFLOWERS ERYSIMUM 
ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE USUAL SORT OF WALLFLOWERS 
THAT MOST OF US ARE USED TO THEY'RE BIENNIALS 
AND THEY CAN ONLY BE GROWN FROM SEED 
BUT THIS WHOLE GROUP OF PLANTS HAVE TO BE PROPAGATED FROM CUTTINGS 
TO KEEP THEM TRUE 
AND JUST LOOK AT THESE LOVELY COLOURS 
I THINK THIS IS JUST THE SORT OF COLOUR WE WANT IN THIS BORDER 
WE WANT IT TO BE RICH AND INVITING 
WELL AS YOU KNOW THE THEME OF TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME IS ALL ABOUT EXPANDING YOUR GARDENING EXPERIENCE 
WE'D LOVE YOU ALL TO TRY GROWING SOMETHING TOTALLY NEW 
LAST YEAR IN THE DRY GARDEN 
JOE PLANTED THESE EREMURUS FOXTAIL LILIES 
AND THEY REALLY SETTLED IN WELL 
THEY'RE GOING TO DO BRILLIANTLY 
THEY WERE NEW TO US THEN 
BUT ONE GROUP OF PLANTS THAT NOBODY'S EVER TRIED AT BERRYFIELDS IS CACTI 
WE WENT TO VISIT BRIAN FEARN IN DERBYSHIRE 
WHO'S GOT FIVE NATIONAL COLLECTIONS OF THESE SPIKY WONDERS 
A CACTUS IS A PLANT THAT HAS LOST ITS LEAVES 
AND THE FUNCTION OF THE LEAVES HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER BY THE STEM WHICH HAS BECOME GREEN 
THE SPINES THAT IT'S GOT ARE TO PREVENT ANIMALS 
FROM GETTING AT THE WATER THAT THE PLANT IS STORING 
AND THE RIBS ARE TO PREVENT THEPLANT FROM BURSTING 
WHEN IT TAKES UP WATER RAPIDLY 
SO IT ACTS LIKE A CONCERTINA 
I WAS ABOUT TEN I SUPPOSE 
WHEN THE FASCINATION FIRST HIT ME 
WE WERE ON HOLIDAY IN SCARBOROUGH 
THERE WAS A GREENGROCER'S SHOP ADJACENT TO WHERE WE WERE STAYING 
WHICH HAD CACTI IN THE WINDOW 
AND THEY LOOKED DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING ELSE 
THESE PLANTS HAVE GOT THE LIFETIME OF TREES 
THEY'LL LIVE TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS PLUS 
AND INDEED SOME OF THE PLANTS I'VE GOT 
I CAN TRACE THE HISTORY BACK TO VICTORIAN TIMES 
THIS PLANT I FOUND TEN YEARS AGO 
IT WAS ONE PLANT AND TWENTY THOUSAND SEEDLINGS 
AND I GREW IT UP AND IT'S PRODUCED THIS BEAUTIFUL VARIEGATED PLANT 
WHICH IS UNIQUE 
THERE'S NOT ANOTHER ONE IN THE WORLD LIKE IT 
MADAGASCAR HAS MORE WEIRD AND WONDERFUL PLANTS AND ANIMALS 
THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD 
AND THIS CALLED DIDIERIA MADAGASCARIENSIS 
IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE WEIRDEST 
WITH ITS LONG NARROW LEAVES AND LONG SPINES 
I MEAN IT'S JUST A WEIRD PLANT 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST MYTHS WITH THESE PLANTS 
IS THAT THEY NEVER FLOWER 
BUT IF YOU FOLLOW A FEW SIMPLE RULES THEY WILL PERFORM YOU EVERY YEAR 
YOU WATER THEM ONCE A WEEK ALL THROUGH THE SUMMER 
THAT'S A GOOD SOAK I MEAN WE USE A HOSEPIPE 
NO WATER AT ALL FROM OCTOBER TO MARCH 
AND THAT REALLY IS NO WATER 
IF YOU WATER THEM IN THE WINTER AND YOU KEEP THEM WARM IN THE WINTER 
THEY WON'T FLOWER FOR YOU IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT 
KEEP THEM COOL AND KEEP THEM DRY 
IF YOU HAVE A WHIM TO WATER THEM IN THE WINTER 
TAKE A WATERING CAN AND CUT THE BOTTOM OUT 
AND THEN YOU CAN GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF ATTEMPTING TO WATER THEM BUT NEVER DOING SO 
SO I'M GOING TO SOW SOME CACTUS SEED FOR OUR DRY GARDEN 
NOW THE TRUTH ABOUT CACTUS IS IT'S A BIT OF A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP 
AND IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE A LONG TIME BEFORE I HAVE CACTUS LIKE BRIAN'S 
SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHY WOULD YOU BOTHER FROM SEED 
WHEN LITTLE CACTUS AS WE ALL KNOW ARE VERY VERY CHEAP 
I GUESS THE REASON IS THERE'S NOTHING MORE SATISFYING THAN BEING ABLE TO SAY I GREW THAT FROM SEED 
SO I'M GOING TO TRY 
NOW YOU NEED TO USE A REALLY REALLY FREE DRAINING POTTING COMPOST 
SO I'VE GOT REGULAR POTTING COMPOST OVER HERE 
AND TO THAT I'M GOING TO ADD A QUARTER SAND SO THAT IT'S A REALLY FREE DRAINING MIXTURE 
THAT'S REALLY ESSENTIAL 
BECAUSE IT'S SO FREE DRAINING YOU'LL NEED TO PUT A BIT OF MESH 
IN THE POT OR ELSE IT'LL ALL RUN RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH 
AND THEN JUST FILL THE POT UP TO THE TOP 
NOW YOU NEED TO LET THAT SOAK IN WATER 
TILL IT'S ALL COMPLETELY WET 
COS IT'S ONLY AT THAT POINT CAN YOU SOW THIS IS RAINWATER 
I'M USING RAINWATER BECAUSE CACTUS DON'T LIKE TAP WATER IT'S GOT A HIGH CALCIUM LEVEL 
AND WHAT I'M GOING TO SOW IS ONE OF THESE 
NOW THIS IS ECHINOCEREUS REICHENBAICHII BALLEYII 
OR THE WOOLLY HEDGEHOG TO YOU AND I 
IT'S A REALLY SWEET LITTLE CACTUS 
EVENTUALLY IT DOES GET BIGGER THAN THIS 
AND IT'S WINTER HARDY IN THE U. K. 
NOW CACTUS SEEDS ARE VERY VERY SMALL 
AND BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALL LIKE ALL SEEDS WHICH ARE TINY 
YOU ONLY SOW THEM ON THE SURFACE YOU NEVER COVER THEM 
REALLY FINE SEED CAN JUST BE TAPPED OFF YOUR HAND 
WHILE GENTLY MOVING 
AROUND THE POT 
CACTUS GROW IN SEMI DESERT CONDITIONS 
SO YOU'VE GOT TO THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY DRY FREE DRAINING BAKED 
AND THEN SUDDENLY THERE'LL BE THIS DOWNPOUR OF RAIN 
AND IT'S IN THAT PERIOD THAT THE SEEDS TAKE ADVANTAGE 
OF THE SUDDEN MOISTURE FROM THE ENVIRONMENT 
AND HAVE TO GET TO WORK REALLY QUICKLY 
SO I'M GOING TO SPRAY THE SURFACE OF THE COMPOST 
WITH SOME MORE MOISTURE BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT KEEPING THE HUMIDITY HIGH 
WHICH IS GOING TO MAKE THESE SEEDS GERMINATE 
AND TO REALLY REALLY LOCK THAT MOISTURE IN 
I'M GOING TO COVER THE WHOLE POT WITH A PLASTIC BAG 
AND IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA TO PUT A LABEL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE POT 
BECAUSE THAT JUST KEEPS THE PLASTIC BAG FROM COLLAPSING IN ON ITSELF 
AND WRAP IT WITH A RUBBER BAND TO LOCK THE MOISTURE IN 
AND THIS WAY I'M GOING TO RECREATE REALLY HUMID CONDITIONS 
AND YOU'LL BE SURPRISED THEY'RE QUITE FAST TO GERMINATE 
IT'S THEREON IN THAT THEY START TO GROW VERY VERY SLOWLY 
SO THEY NEED A DAYTIME TEMPERATURE OF ROUGHLY TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY DEGREES CELSIUS 
AND A NIGHT TIME TEMPERATURE OF SAY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY 
SO THAT'S GOING TO BE THE HOT END OF THIS GREENHOUSE OR SAY A BAKED WINDOWSILL 
IT'S BLOSSOM TIME 
AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THIS WEEK'S BEST OF BERRYFIELDS 
JUST HAS TO CONCENTRATE ON THIS MARVELLOUS BLOSSOM 
IT'S SUCH A FROTHY TIME OF YEAR 
AND ALL THROUGH THE GARDEN YOU CAN SEE BIG CLUMPS OF WHITE AND PINK 
AND I SUPPOSE THIS TREE PRUNUS X. YEDOENSIS 
REALLY ANNOUNCES THIS WHOLE SEASON 
IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST CHERRIES TO FLOWER 
AND WHAT COULD BE MORE BEAUTIFUL 
THAN TO SEE THESE LOVELY DROOPING WHITE BLOSSOMS 
AGAINST A BRIGHT BLUE SKY 
WELL BACK IN JOE'S NORTH LONDON ALLOTMENT 
HE'S PLANTED LOADS OF HIS STAPLES 
BUT NOW HE'S GOING TO TRY SOMETHING REALLY EXOTIC 
PLANTING GOJI BERRIES 
WELL IT'S A REALLY BIG DAY FOR ME TODAY 
I'VE BEEN WORKING THIS PLOT PRETTY MUCH ALONE 
AND TODAY CATHY AND THE KIDS HAVE COME UP TO GIVE ME A HELPING HAND 
YOU KNOW WHAT I HOPE THEY LIKE MY BLOOMIN' TRIANGLES 
I LIKE THE DIAMONDS AND THE TRIANGLES AND THAT 
YOU SAY ALL THE RIGHT THINGS 
DO YOU LIKE THE TRIANGLES 
YEAH SOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF MY TRIANGLES UP HERE 
YOU CAN FIT MORE IN FIT MORE IN THAN WHAT 
A SQUARE CAN YOU 
PROBABLY DEPENDS HOW BIG THE SQUARE IS REALLY 
YOU CAN PUT THESE BROAD BEANS IN WHICH I'VE GROWN AT HOME 
THESE POTS 
OH THE ROOTS JUST ABOUT FILL THE POT 
O. K. BUT THEY GO IN ALMOST TO THE DEPTH OF THE 
HOW FAR APART 
HOW FAR APART HOW FAR APART DO YOU THINK 
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THOSE TWO WOULD BE PERFECT 
OVER HERE CATH 
I'VE BEEN DOING YOU GOT A JOB FOR ME SOME MORE DIGGING 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT GOJI BERRIES ARE CATH UM 
NO DON'T YOU NO OH THEY'RE DELICIOUS GOJI BERRIES 
YEAH YEAH NEVER HEARD OF THEM DRIED GOJI BERRIES 
OH I'VE SEEN THEM YEAH YEAH I'VE SEEN THEM 
THESE ARE FROM CHINA THEY'RE ACTUALLY A TIBETAN MONGOLIAN PLANT 
BUT I THOUGHT RATHER THAN FLYING THEM OVER FROM CHINA 
WE COULD GROW SOME OURSELVES THEY'RE GOOD FOR YOU ARE THEY 
YEAH THEY TASTE A BIT FUNNY WHEN THEY'RE DRIED 
WHAT ARE THEY LIKE FRESH 
BETTER HOPEFULLY 
BUT THE FRUIT'S LIKE A LITTLE BERRY 
LIKE GRAPE SIZED A BIT SMALLER THAN A GRAPE 
BUT THE ACTUAL PLANTS ARE REALLY NICE BIG SORT OF DECIDUOUS BUSHES 
THEY GROW UP TO ABOUT TEN FEET OR YOU CAN PRUNE THEM BACK 
AND THEY'LL FILL THIS SPACE I'VE GOT 
AND THEY'RE BARE ROOTED LOOK THEY'RE REALLY 
THEY'RE ALREADY GOING A BIT MENTAL 
SO DIG A HOLE YEAH PUT THEM IN O. K. 
HOW FAR APART DO I PLANT THEM 
ABOUT O. K. YEAH ABOUT AT LEAST A METRE 
DOT THEM IN THAT SPACE YES ALL IN THAT SPACE 
YOU KNOW HOW TO DIG A HOLE YEAH 
WELL I THINK HE'S DONE A LOT OF WORK 
HE'S PUT A LOT OF ENERGY AND EFFORT INTO THIS 
FROM WHAT IT WAS WITH ALL THE GRASS AND 
HE'S DONE ALL THE DIGGING AND WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT IT 
BUT NOT COME DOWN HERE YET 
SO IT'S REALLY EXCITING TO START ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK 
I THINK WE'LL COME DOWN A LOT 
THE KIDS WILL REALLY ENJOY IT THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER KIDS HERE 
WHICH IS REALLY NICE THEY CAN GO OFF AND BE A BIT WILD 
SEE YOUR DAD'S GOT THE BIG ONES 
WE'VE GOT YOU THE LITTLE ONES 
HO HO RIGHT HOLD ON 
WE'LL HAVE A COMPETITION ALL THE KIDS BIGGEST SUNFLOWER 
YOU IN FOR IT YOU UP FOR IT YEAH 
YOU UP FOR IT YOU SURE YEAH 
THEY'RE RUSSIAN GIANTS YES BOTH RUSSIAN GIANTS YES 
YOU GOING TO GO AND GET THEM THEN 
THERE YOU ARE WHAT DO YOU SAY THANKS 
THANK YOU THEY'RE NOT RUSSIAN GIANTS YET 
SO WHAT YOU DO DON'T LISTEN TO WHAT YOUR DAD SAYS 
RIGHT 
MAKE SURE YOU DIG DOWN A BIT 
DIG DOWN ABOUT A FOOT O. K. AND THEN PUT THIS GUNK IN 
PUT THAT STUFF ON TOP YEP 
AND YOU'LL BE WELL AWAY 
AND THAT SHOULD GROW IF YOU DON'T GET 
OURS ARE GOING TO GROW TO ABOUT TWENTY FOOT IF YOU DON'T GET EIGHTEEN FOOT THEY'RE NO GOOD 
A LOT OF STUFF'S HAPPENED TODAY 
YOU KNOW POTATOES GONE IN 
THE ARTICHOKES HAVE GONE IN 
THE KIDS HAVE GOT THEIR BEDS PLANTED UP GOJI BERRIES 
TALKING POINTS AND IT'S BEEN A REALLY GOOD DAY 
LOADS OF PEOPLE UP AND ABOUT AND I HOPE ALL SUMMER 
SPRING AND SUMMER THERE'S GOING TO BE LOADS OF PEOPLE UP HERE 
IT'S GOOD GETTING INTO IT 
WELL OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS LOTS OF THINGS HAVE CHANGED ABOUT GARDENERS' WORLD 
BUT OUR PASSION FOR PLANTS AND GARDENING 
REMAINS JUST AS STRONG AS EVER 
SO WE THOUGHT IT'D BE REALLY NICE FROM TIME TO TIME 
TO LOOK BACK TO SEE WHAT OTHER GARDENERS' WORLD PRESENTERS WERE DOING 
ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY 
AND WHERE BETTER TO START 
THAN WITH THE LOVELY GEOFF HAMILTON AT BARNSDALE 
WHERE ALMOST TO THE DAY TWELVE YEARS AGO 
HE WAS PLANTING ASPARAGUS 
I'VE BEEN WORKING THESE DEEP BEDS NOW FOR TWELVE YEARS 
AND WORKING MANURE OR COMPOST IN EVERY SINGLE YEAR 
AND IT'S GOT TO THE STAGE NOW 
WHERE I DON'T ACTUALLY NEED TO PUT MY FOOT ON THE SPADE WHEN I DIG 
JUST PUSH IN LIKE THAT 
BUT THE DRAINAGE NOW IS VERY GOOD AND THAT IS IDEAL FOR ASPARAGUS 
NOW THE BED AT THE MOMENT LOOKS A BIT LIKE THE FRONT LINE AT THE SOMME 
BUT ALL WILL BE EXPLAINED 
THE ASPARAGUS WILL ARRIVE 
IN POLYTHENE BAGS LIKE THIS 
AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO KEEP THESE ROOTS MOIST 
SO THE FIRST THING TO DO 
IS TO DROP THEM INTO A BUCKET OF WATER FOR ABOUT AN HOUR 
AND THEN WHEN YOU DO YOU MAKE UP THESE TRENCHES 
NOW THESE HAVE GOT TO BE TWENTY FIVE C. M. THAT'S TEN INCHES DEEP 
THIRTY C. M. THAT'S A FOOT WIDE 
AND ABOUT A METRE APART 
AND YES I'M AFRAID LIKE IT OR NOT 
WE HAVE GOT TO GET USED TO METRIC MEASUREMENTS 
THE ROOTS WANT TO GO IN SIXTY C. M. TWO FEET APART 
AND WHAT YOU DO IS YOU MAKE UP A LITTLE MOUND LIKE THIS 
IN THE CENTRE OF THE TRENCH 
AND JUST PUT THE ROOTS IN STRADDLING THEM EITHER SIDE 
AND THEN YOU COVER THEM UP WITH ABOUT THREE INCHES OF SOIL TO START WITH 
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED 
AND THEY'LL BE EARTHED UP A BIT MORE AS THEY GROW 
AND IN A COUPLE OF YEARS' TIME 
I SHALL FINISH UP WITH A SUPERB BED OF ASPARAGUS 
ENOUGH HOPEFULLY TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT WITH MY FRIENDS 
WELL THIS IS OUR ASPARAGUS BED 
MONTY PLANTED IT FOUR YEARS AGO 
USING EXACTLY THE SAME METHOD THAT GEOFF HAD EMPLOYED 
THIS TIME LAST YEAR THE WHOLE GROUND WAS FULL OF THESE SPEARS 
PIERCING THROUGH THE EARTH 
BECAUSE IT WAS UNUSUALLY MILD 
BUT THIS YEAR THERE'S NOT A SIGN OF THEM 
THIS YEAR THE RSPB'S BIG BIRDWATCH SURVEY 
HAS REVEALED THAT IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS 
THERE'S BEEN A HUGE DECLINE 
IN THE NUMBER OF OUR MOST POPULAR GARDEN BIRDS 
SO IF YOU ONLY HAVE TIME TO DO ONE THING THIS WEEKEND 
IT MUST BE TO ENCOURAGE OUR NATIVE BIRDS BACK INTO OUR GARDENS 
PUT OUT FRESH WATER 
MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A PLENTIFUL SUPPLY OF GOOD QUALITY BIRD FOOD 
SOW SOME SUNFLOWERS NOW 
THAT'LL PROVIDE THE BIRDS WITH A FEAST LATER IN THE YEAR 
BIRDS ALSO NEED SHELTER 
AND US GARDENERS WE'RE IN A MARVELLOUS POSITION 
TO BE ABLE TO OFFER THEM A WIDE VARIETY OF HABITATS 
AND WE SHOULD ALL STRIVE TO DO SO 
WELL THAT'S IT THIS WEEK FROM GARDENERS' WORLD 
IF THERE'S ANY OTHER INFORMATION YOU NEED ABOUT THE PROGRAMME 
VISIT OUR WEBSITE 
NEXT WEEK IT'S SNOOKER 
BUT THE WEEK AFTER WE'LL BE JOINING YOU AGAIN FROM THE MALVERN SHOW 
TILL THEN GOODBYE FROM BERRYFIELDS
