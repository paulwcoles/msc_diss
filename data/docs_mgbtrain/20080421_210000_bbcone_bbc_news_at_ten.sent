MILLIONS WORSE OFF LABOUR M. P.'S 
DEMAND IMMEDIATE ACTION

PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST OUT AS A 
RESULT OF THIS COCK UP ARE

PREMIERE 
GOOD EVENING GORDON BROWN HAS TOLD 
LABOUR M. P.'S TONIGHT THAT HE DOES 
UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. TAX RATE THE 
PRIME MINISTER IS TRYING TO HEAD 
OFF A DAMAGING BACKBENCH REBELLION 
AFTER THE NEWS THAT MILLIONS OF LOW 
EARNERS HAVE BEEN LEFT WORSE OFF 
MINISTERS HAVE NOW PROMISED A 
REVIEW BUT SOME LABOUR M. P.'S ARE 
DEMANDING COMPENSATION FOR THOSE 
HARDEST HIT OUR FIRST REPORT 
TONIGHT IS FROM OUR POLITICAL 
EDITOR NICK ROBINSON 
AT FIRST SIGHT THIS IS AN ARGUMENT 
ABOUT HOW BEST TO HELP THE POOR N. 
TRUTH NOW THE ROW ABOUT THE TEN P. TAX 
RATE IS AS MUCH ABOUT THE AUTHORITY 
WHO LIVES HERE OF THE MAN WHO 
LIVES HERE GORDON BROWN TODAY 
ADMITTED HE DID HAVE A PROBLEM 
THOUGH HE COULDN'T BRING HIMSELF TO 
SAY SO IN PUBLIC 
I KNOW THERE'S A 
DEBATE ABOUT TEN P. TAXATION AS A 
RESULT OF WHAT WE'VE DONE THREE 
MILLION FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN ARE 
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN EIGHTY A WEEK BETTER OFF 
THAT DEBATE TOOK PLACE IN PRIVATE 
TONIGHT IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
AFTER LABOUR M. P.'S WERE HASTILY 
SUMMONED TO HEAR THEIR LEADER HE 
TOLD THEM WHAT PEOPLE WANTED TO 
KNOW WAS WHETHER WE GET IT WE DO 
GET IT HE SAID WE WILL LIST TON 
WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING WITH THE 
CHANCELLOR AT HIS SIDE HE PLEADED 
WITH M. P.'S NOT TO DEFEAT THE BUDGET 
IN A VOTE NEXT WEEK MANY LIKED 
WHAT THEY HEARD BUT THE M. P. LEADING 
THE REVOLT FRANK FIELD INSISTED 
THAT MINISTERS HAD TO DO SOMETHING 
NOW BY THE TIME GORDON BROWN 
EMERGED ONTO THIS CORRIDOR HE HAD 
CONVINCED MANY OF HIS M. P.'S THAT HE 
HAD THE POLITICAL WILL TO DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT THE TEN P. TAX RATE 
HIS PROBLEM IS THAT HE DIDN'T SAY 
WHAT AND HE DIDN'T SAY WHEN THERE 
WILL BE A TREASURY REVIEW THIS 
AUTUMN AS ONE SOURCE IN THE 
TREASURY PUT IT TO ME HE'D LIKE TO 
DO SOMETHING BUT WE DON'T LIKE THE 
MONEY WHAT DID CONCERNED M. P.'S MAKE 
OF WHAT THEY HEARD 
I WANT TO SEE 
MY CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE BEEN 
LOSING OUT THIS WEEK IN THEIR PAY 
PACKETS I WANT TO SEE THAT 
RESTORED JO TO GET PEOPLE TOGETHER 
IF THE SOLUTION IS MONTHS AWAY IT'S 
NOT ENOUGH 
THIS IS THE MOMENT AN 
UNLUCKY THIRTEEN MONTHS AGO THAT GORDON 
BROWN MADE THE TAX CHANGES THAT ARE 
CAUSING SUCH A HEADACHE 
I WILL CUT 
THE BASIC RACE OF INCOME TAX FROM 
TWENTY TWO P. TO TWENTY P. 
THOSE CHEERING THAT DAY 
IGNORED HOW HE WAS GOING TO PAY FOR 
IT THE PROBLEM IS LOOK AT THE 
LOSERS SINGLE P. EMWITH NO CHILDREN 
IN LOW PF PAID JOBS ABOUT TWENTY TWO 
MILLION IN THIS CATEGORY NEXT 
COUPLES ON LOW EARNINGS WITH 
CHILDREN AND NOT GETTING TAX 
CREDITS IT'S THOUGHT TWELVE MILLION 
COUPLES WILL BE WORSE OFF THE 
WINNERS ARE MOST PEOPLE EARNING 
BETWEEN JUST OVER NINETEEN TO FORTY THOUSAND 
GAINING MOST PENSIONERS AND 
HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN 
WHAT I'M 
SAYING TODAY TO LABOUR M. P.'S IS THAT 
YOU DIDN'T COME INTO POLITICS TO 
HAVE A SPECIALLY TARGETED TAX RISE 
AT SOME OF THE LOWEST PAID PEOPLE 
IN BRITAIN 
THOSE LABOUR M. P.'S NOW 
HAVE A WEEK TO DECIDE WHETHER TO 
VOTE WITH THE TORIES TO FORCE A U. 
TURN OR TO TAKE THEIR LEADER AT HIS 
WORD WORD WE TALK TO NICK NOW IN DOWNING 
STREET WHAT IS YOUR SENSE OF THING 
TONIGHT AFTER THIS LATEST APPEAL 
FROM THE PRIME MINISTER 
MY SENSE 
IS THAT LABOUR M. P.'S ARE MAKING A 
CALCULATION WHAT MORE COULD WE GET 
THE GOVERNMENT TO CONCEDE IF WE 
CARRY ON AND AT WHAT PRICE THAT IS 
ALWAYS THE TEST BEFORE ANY 
REBELLION BECAUSE ALTHOUGH GORDON 
BROWN TODAY HAS SAID HE UNDERSTANDS 
HE'S ENDED HIS DENIAL HE HASN'T 
PUTNEY MONEY ON THE TABLE HE'S NOT 
BEEN EXPLICIT ABOUT WHEN THAT MONEY 
WOULD BE PAID OUT NO ONE KNOWS WHO 
WOULD GAIN AND WHO WOULD CARRY ON 
BEING A LOSER LABOUR M. P.'S HAVE TO 
DECIDE IS THERE ANY CHANCE HE WILL 
DO THAT AND IF HE DOES IF HE WERE 
FORCED TO MAKE SUCH A MASSIVE 
CONCESSION AT WHAT PRICE WOULD 
THAT BE FOR HIS OWN AUTHORITY AS 
PRIME MINISTER BAD ENOUGH AT ANY 
TIME BUT APPALLING JUST DAYS 
BEFORE CRUCIAL ELECTIONS IN MUCH OF 
ENGLAND AND ALL OF WALES THAT IS A 
CALCULATION THEY'RE MAKING HE'D BE 
A FOOL TONIGHT TO SAY HERE THAT YOU 
KNEW QUITE HOW IT WOULD GO 
REMEMBER ANY BETTING MAN SHOULD 
ALWAYS BET ON GOVERNMENTS WINNING 
THAT'S WHY WE GIVE THEM MAJORITIES 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS INJECTED 
FIFTY BILLION INTO THE FINANCIAL 
SYSTEM TO TRY TO EASE THE EFFECTS 
OF THE CREDIT SHORTAGE THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND WILL ALLOW INSTITUTIONS TO 
SWAP MORTGAGE BASED SECURITIES FOR 
GOVERNMENT BONDS THEY WANT TO 
PROMOTE MORE LENDING BETWEEN BANKS 
AND ENCOURAGE MORE LEND TO PEOPLE 
WHO WANT MORTGAGES ROBERT PESTON 
HAS THIS REPORT 
FORTY FIVE NOW GOT IT 
THIS IS ONE FACE OF 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH AN AUCTION OF 
HOMES REPOSSESSED BY BANKS 
ACCORDING TO MANY ECONMISTS IT'S 
STILL EARLY DAYS IN THE HOUSING 
MARKET DOWN TURN RIGHT NOW THERE'S 
NO SIGN OF A BAILOUT FOR THOSE 
HAVING DIFFICULTIES MAKING PAYMENTS 
ON THEIR MORTGAGES BUT FOR THE 
LENDERS BRITAIN'S BANKS AND 
BUILDING SOCIETIES WHO ARE 
CROWNICALLY SHORT OF CASH 
SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT WAS OFFERED 
TODAY BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND 
TREASURY WHAT'S THE DEAL 
BRITAIN'S BANKS HAVE FOR THE PAST 
FEW YEARS BECOME FINANCIALLY DEPEN 
DENT ON SELLING THEIR MORTGAGES TO 
INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS THEY RAISE 
SIXTY BILLION IN THIS WAY IN THE 
FIRST HALF OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WHEN THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH TOOK HOLD LAST AUGUST THE 
SAME INVESTIGATORS SAID THEY'D HAD 
ENOUGH WHICH LEFT OUR BANKS 
CROWNICALLY SHORT OF CASH TO LEND 
TO US TODAY THE BANK BANK OF 
ENGLAND STEPPED IN SAYING THEY 
COULD SWAP THESE LOANS FOR FIFTY 
BILLION IN GOVERNMENT LOANS 
INITIALLY ALL OF WHICH CAN EASILY 
BE TURNED INTO PRECIOUS CASH SO 
WHY THE RESCUE THIS CHAP JUSTIN 
KING THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND BECAME VERY CONCERNED IN 
MARCH AT THE ESCALATION OF THE CIES 
N. I. S. FINANCIAL MARKETS HE FEARED 
THAT BANKS WERE SO CRONICALLY SHORT 
OF FUNDS ALMOST ANY OF THEM COULD 
GO BUST TODAY HE'S SAID THAT ANY 
WELL RUN BANK CAN COUNTS ON 
FINANCIAL HELP FROM THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND EFFECTIVELY PREVENTING ALL 
BUT THE MOST INCOMPETENT FROM 
COLLAPSING UNDERSTANDABLY MOST OF 
OUR BIG BANKS SAY THE WEATHER HAS 
BRIGHTENED UP BUT WHAT'S THE 
OUTLOOK FOR HOME OWNERS 
IT WON'T 
TOTALLY REMOVE THE PROBLEMS IN 
MONEY MARKETS MORTGAGES WILL BE 
EXPENSIVE A LOT OF THOSE PROBLEMS 
ARE STILL GOING TO BE WITH US THE THE CONTRAST BEING OUTLOOK FOR HOME 
OWNERS AND BANKS DOESN'T PLEASE 
EVERYONE 
IF THE GOVERNMENT IS EVERYONE GOING TO CREATE THIS ENORMOUS 
OVERDRAFT FACILITY FOR THE BANKS 
IT SHOULD BE LINKED TO CHANGES IN 
THE BANKS' BEHAVIOUR THEY HAVE TO 
ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR LOSSES WHICH IS 
SUBSTANTIAL THEIR SHAREHOLDERS 
HAVE TO COVER THEM NOT THE TAX 
PAYER 
TOMORROW THERE WILL BE BIG PAYER PAIN FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE 
ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND ASKED TO 
PUMP IN TWELVE BILLION TO MAKE UP FOR 
ITS PAST SINS 
A BRITISH SOLDIER HAS BEEN KILLED 
IN AN EXPLOSION IN SOUTHERN 
AFGHANISTAN HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE 
QUEENS ROYAL LANCERS REGIMENT 
ESCORTING A SUPPLY CONVOY TO THE 
BRITISH BASE AT CAMP BASTION IN 
HELMAND PROVINCE A SECOND SOLDIER 
WAS INJURED IN THE BLAST AND IS 
RECEIVING TREATMENT AT THE FIELD 
HOSPITAL HOSPITAL BRITAIN HAS ACCUSED PRESIDENT 
MUGABE OF BEATING HIS OWN PEOPLE TO 
DEATH IN HIS BID TO CLING TO POWER 
DAVID MILIBAND THE FOREIGN 
SECRETARY ALSO SAID THAT NO ONE 
HAD ANY CONFIDENCE IN THE 
RECOUNTING OF VOTES NOW UNDER WAY 
IN ZIMBABWE THE VIOLENCE BEING 
USED BY MR. MUGABE'S SUPPORTERS IS 
SEEN IN IMAGES OBTAINED BY THE B. B. C. 
THE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE AND 
BEATINGS IN ZIMBABWE THAT ROBERT 
MUGABE'S ZANU P. F. SAY ARE NOT 
HAPPENING THESE MEN WERE CLUBBED 
AND SMASHED FOR VOTING THE WRONG 
WAY THE OPPOSITION CLAIMS THEY'RE 
TARGETS OF A SYSTEMATIC PROGRAMME 
OF BRUTALITY TEN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
KILLED SINCE THE DISPUTED ELECTIONS 
AND HUNDREDS PUT IN HOSPITAL THEY THEY STRUCK ME ON THE HEAD WITH AN IRON 
BAR THEY PROCEEDED BEATING ME WITH 
VERY BIG STICKS ON BOTH LEGS ON 
MY BACK ON MY HEAD AS WELL AS MY 
HANDS 
HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS SAY HANDS THERE'S NOW EVEN EVIDENCE OF 
TORTURE CAMPS 
WHAT WE'VE BEEN 
IDENTIFYING ARE CAMPS SET UP BY 
ZANU P. F. MILITIA AND OTHERS CLOSE TO 
THE RULING PARTY TO PUNISH 
FOR HAVING 
VOTED 
FOR THE OPPOSITION 
PARTY PEOPLE ARE TAKEN THERE AT 
NIGHT HELD FOR SEVERAL HOURS 
BEATEN WITH WOODEN PLANKS AND THEN 
LEFT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THE THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT SAYS 
EXAGGERATED CLAIMS OF VIOLENCE ARE 
BEING USED BY THE OPPOSITION TO 
STIR UP THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
AND GET IT TO INTERVENE L. SPOKE TO 
A MEMBER OF ROBERT MUGABE'S 
GOVERNMENT ON THE TELEPHONE I I DON'T KNOW WHERE THESE THINGS ARE 
COMING FROM IT'S VERY VERY 
PEACEFUL IN HARARE YES THERE MAY 
BE CLASHES BUT THINGS ARE QUITE 
PEACEFUL 
THAT'S NOT THE IMPRESSION PEACEFUL IF YOU TALK TO THE M. D. C. THEY 
DESCRIBE THE SITUATION IN THE 
COUNTRY NOW AS A STATE OF WAR ONE I WISH YOU WERE HERE TO SEE WHAT IS 
HAPPENING THINGS ARE QUITE NORMAL 
BUT THEY ARE NOT NORMAL THE PEOPLE 
OF ZIMBABWE ARE NO CLOSER TO 
FINDING OUT WHO WON THE VOTE THREE 
WEEKS AGO IN A STRONGLY WORDED 
STATEMENT DAVID MILIBAND THE 
FOREIGN SECRETARY DESCRIBED IT AS 
AN ATTEMPT TO STEAL THE ELECTION 
THE PARTIAL RECOUNT GOING ON NOW A 
CHARADE OF DEMOCRACY THIS STINGING 
CRITICISM WILL SIMPLY SERVE TO 
REINFORCE THE VIEW OF ROBERT MUGABE 
AND HIS FOLLOWERS THAT ALL 
ZIMBABWE'S PROBLEMS COME FROM 
ABROAD AND THAT THE FORMER COLONIAL 
MASTER BRITAIN IS PUBLIC ENEMY 
NUMBER ONE 
THE FORMER AMERICAN PRESIDENT JIMMY 
CARTER HAS SAID THE ISRAELIS AND 
AMERICANS WON'T BE ABLE TO SECURE A 
PEACE DEAL WITH THE PALESTINIANS 
UNLESS HAMAS IS INVOLVED IN THE 
NEGOTIATIONS HAMAS HAS REITERATED 
IT WOULD CALL TRUCE WITH ISRAEL 
IF A PALESTINIAN STATE WAS ACCEPTED 
ON PRE NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN BORDERS BUT IT 
WOULDN'T RECOGNISE ISRAEL ITSELF 
TALKS AIMED AT AVERTING STRIKE BY 
WORKERS AT THE GRANGEMOUTH OIL 
REFINERY ARE TO BE HELD TOMORROW AT 
ACAS GRANGE MOUTH HAS STARTED THE 
PRO SES OF SHUTTING DOWN THERE ARE 
WORRIES ABOUT THE DISRUPTION TO 
SUPPLIES AND THEY'VE HELPED TO PUSH 
UP THE PRICE OF OIL TO ANOTHER 
RECORD HIGH DURING THE DAY OUR 
CORRESPONDENT IS AT GRANGEMOUTH 
TONIGHT TONIGHT THOSE TALKS AT ACAS ONE OF THE 
FIRST POSITIVE SIGNS IN BITTER 
DISPUTE AND POTENTIAL STRIKE WHICH 
IF IT WENT AHEAD COULD SEE 
GRANGEMOUTH SHUT DOWN FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN ITS SEVENTY FOUR YEAR HISTORY 
IT IS SCOTLAND'S BIGGEST OIL 
REFINERY AND TODAY THE FIRST OF ITS 
MAJOR CRUDE OIL UNITS WAS CLOSED 
DOWN IT'S A SPRAWLING INDUSTRIAL 
COMPLEX DOMINATING THE HORIZON BY 
THE END OF THE WEEK THE ENTIRE 
PLANT COULD BE OFFLINE 
THIS IS NOT 
SCAREMONGERING THIS IS BEING 
REALISTIC I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
SAFETY OF THIS SITE IT IS MY PRIME 
RESPONSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT WHEN THE 
TRADE UNIONS WITHDRAW THEIR LABOUR 
THIS WEEKEND THAT THIS PLANT IS 
SAFE THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO I'M 
BEING REALISTIC IN THAT 
GRANGEMOUTH'S OWNERS WANT TO INVEST 
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY IN A MODERNISATION PROGRAMME 
WHICH WOULD ALSO INVOLVE CHANGING 
FINAL SALARY PENSIONS IT'S A 
DISPUTE PLAYED OUT MORE IN PUBLIC 
THAN IN THE NEGOTIATING TABLE 
THERE'S ACCUSATIONS AND 
COUNTERCLAIMS BY BOTH SIDES THE 
UNION AS CUESING THEM OF HOLDING 
SCOTLAND TO RANSOM 
IT'S BEGGARS 
BELIEFS THE TACTICS DEPLOYED IN 
THIS DISPUTE IT'S ECONOMIC 
TERRORISM 
ACCORDING TO THE COMPANY TERRORISM THOSE CLAIMS ARE ABSURD RIDICULOUS 
AND ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY IN PERTH EDINBURGH DUNDEE 
THE FORECOURTS ARE BUSY BUT 
THERE'S NO SIGNS OF PANIC AS LONG 
AS THAT CONTINUES THERE'S PLENTY OF 
FUEL IN THE SYSTEM IF THE STRIKE 
ISN'T AVERTED CONTINGENCY PLANS ARE 
BEING PUT IN PLACE TO MINIMISE WHAT 
COULD EVENTUALLY BE SIGNIFICANT 
DISRUPTION DISRUPTION THOSE PLANS WOULD SEE FUEL 
TRANSPORTED FROM REFINERIES 
ELSEWHERE IN BRITAIN BRITAIN HAS 
SEVERAL WEEKS OF SUPPLYS IF THIS 
STRIKE WENT AHEAD THOSE WOULD BE 
NEEDED IT WOULD BE A TWO DAY 
STRIKE IF GRANGEMOUTH SHUT DOWN IT 
COULD TAKE UP TO A MONTH TO GET 
BACK ONLINE 
COMING UP WHY THIS TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD 
STUDENT COULD HAVE A BIG SAY IN THE 
U. S. PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST 
THE FORMER MAYOR OF PEMBROKE IS

RECORDED OWE FISHIATING AT FOOTBALL 
MATCHES HE REFEREED OR RAN THE 
LINE IN AT LEAST SIXTY SEVEN GAMES WHILE 
CLAIMING MOBILITY AND CARE 
ALLOWANCES FROM THIS FOOTAGE HE 
CERTAINLY DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A MAN 
WHO EFFECTIVELY SAID HE COULD 
HARDLY WALK INVESTIGATORS FROM THE 
DEPARTMENT OF WORK AND PENSIONS 
WERE AMAZED BY HOW BRAZEN HE WAS 
MR. MCNIFFE TOLD US HE HAD SEVERE 
MOBILITY RESTRICTIONS HE TOLD US 
HE NEEDED ASSISTANCE WITH DAY TO 
DAY ROUTINE ACTIVITY HERE WE FIND 
HIM AND OBSERVE AND FILM HIM OWE 
FISHIATING AT TWO FOOTBALL MATCHES 
FOR THE FULL NINETY MINUTES EACH 
TACKLING BENEFIT FRAUD IS AN AREA 
HUGE PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT 
HERE IN WALES INVESTIGATORS SAY 
THEY HAVE DOZENS OF CASES JUST LIKE 
MR. MCNIFFE WHERE PEOPLE ARE 
ILLEGALLY CLAIMING THOUSANDS OF 
POUNDS EVERY YEAR 
I BASICALLY HAVE 
BEEN NAIVE TO THE FACT I SHOULD 
HAVE REPORTED THE CHANGE OF 
CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT 
SITUATION YOU DON'T REALISE WHAT'S 
GOING ON 
MCNIFFE TODAY PLEADED 
GUILTY TO ILLEGALLY CLAIMING 
BENEFITS AND HAS BEEN WARNED HE MAY 
FACE JAIL 
A TEENAGE BABYSITTER HAS BEEN FOUND 
GUILTY OF MURDERING A YOUNG CHILD 
IN HIS CARE JOSHUA COOK WAS SEVENTEEN

OLD CHARLIE JOHNSON AT THE CHILD'S 
HOME IN SCARBOROUGH LAST YEAR THE 
BOY DIED FROM SEVERE HEAD INJURIES 
FOLLOWING A SUSTAINED AND VIOLENT 
ATTACK A POLICE SPOKESMAN READ 
THIS STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE 
FAMILY 
WHILST THE GUILTY VERDICT FAMILY HELPS TO BRING SOME CLOSURE COOK'S 
FAILURE TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS ACTIONS 
HAS LEFT THE FAMILY WITH MANY 
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT 
HAPPENED TO THEIR SON CHARLEY WAS 
A BRIGHT HAPPY BOY AND A JOY TO BE 
AROUND HE HAS LEFT A HUGE GAP IN 
THE LIVES OF HIS FAMILY IN 
PARTICULAR HIS BROTHER AND SISTER 
WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO COME TO TERMS 
WITH LIFE WITHOUT THEIR BABY 
BROTHER BROTHER MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY CHILDREN HAVE BEEN 
RESCUED BY AN ORGANISATION CREATED 
TO COMBAT SEX OFFENDERS USING THE 
INTERNET THE CHILD EXPLOITATION 
AND ONLINE PROTECTION CENTRE 
CARRIED OUT TWENTY ONE RAIDS OVER THE PAST 
YEAR AGAINST SUSPECTED PAEDOPHILES 
NICK HIEM IS HERE WITH THE DETAILS 
CEOP WAS SET UP JUST TWO YEARS AGO 
TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM SEXUAL 
ABUSE AND TRACK DOWN OFFENDERS 
ESPECIALLY PAEDOPHILES USING THE 
INTERNET LAST YEAR IT ARRESTED TWO HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN 
SUSPECTED PAEDOPHILES THAT'S THREE 
TIMES AS MANY AS IN THE 
ORGANISATION'S FIRST YEAR IT'S 
INFILTRATED AND DISMANTLED SIX 
PAEDOPHILE NETWORKS AND RESCUED ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE 
CHILDREN SOME AFTER BEING 
IDENTIFIED BY AIM IMAGES ON THE 
WEB MOST WHEN THEY WERE FOUND 
LIVING WITH SUSPECTED ABUSERS 
TIMOTHY COX WAS PAEDOPHILE HE 
RAN WEBSITE FROM SUFFOLK FARM 
WHICH CHARGED FOR ACCESS TO 
INDECENT IMAGES HE CALLED IT 
KIDS THE LIGHT OF OUR LIVES 
OFFICERS TRACKED HIM DOWN TOOK 
OVER HIS ONLINE IDENTITY AND SET 
OUT TO DISRUPT HIS NETWORK THEY 
TRACED AND ARRESTED MANY OF HIS 
CUSTOMERS BOTH HERE IN BRITAIN AND 
OVERSEAS 
THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE OVERSEAS SUSPECTED OF THESE OFFENCES ARE 
SUSPECTED OF SOME OF THE WORST TYPE 
OF OFFENCES YOU CAN IMAGINE 
CHILDREN ARE BEING MADE SAFER 
WE'RE SENDING A STRONG MESSAGE OUT 
IF YOU GO ONLINE AND LOOK TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF CHILDREN WE'RE THERE 
WE'RE WATCHING WE WILL HOLD YOU TO 
ACCOUNT 
BUT IF MORE PEOPLE ARE ACCOUNT BEING AREFTDED DOES THAT MEAN 
THERE ARE MORE PAEDOPHILES OR ARE 
WE JUST GETTING BETTER AT CATCHING 
THEM EXPERTS SUGGEST IT'S A BIT OF 
BOTH THE INTERNET MEANS THAT 
IMAGES OF ABUSE ARE READYILY 
AVAILABLE AND THERE ARE MANY MORE 
OF THEM WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE 
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT MEANS THERE ARE 
MORE OFFENDERS THOUGH NOT ALL MAY 
BE HARD CORE ABUSERS 
MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE HISTORICALLY 
WOULD NOT HAVE PURSUED CHILD 
PORNOGRAPHY TO TAKE THE RISK OF 
TRAVELLING TO SECURE IT TO TAKE 
THE RISK OF GETTING CAUGHT WITH IT 
THE PRIVACY OF THE INTERNET THE 
ANONYMITY OF IT AND THE INEXPENSE 
OF IT IS TEMPTING PEOPLE DOWN THAT 
ROUTE TEMPTING THEM TO MAYBE 
INDULGE A CURIOSITY IT MAY BE 
NOTHING BIGGER THAN THAT BUT BUT WHAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE IS THAT CEOP 
HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN TRACKING 
DOWN OFFENDERS AND IN IDENTIFYING 
VICTIMS AND TAKING STEPS TO PROTECT 
THEM 
SURVEILLANCE PICTURES SHOWING TWO 
OF THE JULY SEVENTH TERROR SUSPECTS 
MEETING A SUSPECT AT A MCDONALDS

AS PART OF A SURVEILLANCE OPERATION 
ALI AND TWO OTHER MEN DENY THE 
CHARGES AGAINST THEM 
CHARGES AGAINST THEM 
THERE HAS 
BEEN A SURGE OF NEGATIVE 
CAMPAIGNING IN THE RACE FOR THE 
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION 
AS HILLARY CLINTON AND BARACK OBAMA 
BATTLE FOR EVERY VOTE IN THE LATEST 
PRIMARY ELECTION IN PENNSYLVANIA 
BOTH CANDIDATES ARE ALSO CHASING 
EVERY SUPERDELEGATE THOSE SENIOR 
PARTY MEMBERS WHOSE VOTES COULD 
DECIDE THE FINAL OUTCOME 
AN IMAGE OF OSAMA BIN LADEN OTHERS 
OF WAR AND DISASTER THE MESSAGE 
FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN DON'T 
TAKE A CHANCE WITH OBAMA AND FROM 
HIM 
BOTH CANDIDATE ALSO SAY ALMOST 
ANYTHING EAT ALMOST ANYTHING NOW 
TO WIN BOTH ARE CRISS CROSSING 
PENNSYLVANIA TRYING TO LOOK 
APPROACHABLE HOME SPUN IF BARACK 
OBAMA WINS TOMORROW IT WILL ALL BE 
OVER SHE WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY 
HAVE TO GIVE UP IF SHE WINS SHE 
CAN STAY IN THE RACE 
HERE'S WHY 
SHE HAS LITTLE HOPE OF OVERTAKING 
HIM BUT THERE ARE AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SIX 
UNELECTED SUPERDELEGATES THEY 
COULD SWING THE CONTEST EITHER WAY 
SO WHO ARE THEY THESE POWERFUL 
INSIDERS WE VISITED THE UNIVERSITY 
IN MILWAUKEE WISCONSIN POLITICS 
STUDENTS HERE WILL TELL YOU MOST 
SUPERDELEGATES ARE PARTY BIG WIGS 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 
BUT IS JASON A BIG WIG 
NOT REALLY BUT HE'S PARTY ACTIVIST 
AND HE IS A SUPERDELEGATE AND THE 
PARTIES AND THEIR BACKERS ARE 
DESPERATE FOR HIS SUPPORT 
I HAVE 
SPOKEN TO CHELSEA CLINTON AND

SWALLOW ANY PRIDE THEY MIGHT HAVE 
HAD AND GRIP AND GRIN WITH 
DELEGATES AS IF THEIR LIVES DEPEND 
ON IT IS THIS FAIR ACROSS AMERICA 
IN WYOMING WHERE THE PACE OF LIFE 
GIVES TIME FOR SERIOUS THOUGHT WE 
HAVE A DELEGATE WHO IS LESS 
IMPRESSED BY THE PARTY POLITICS AN 
EYE SURGEON WHO THINKS THAT 
OVERTURNING THE WILL OF THE 
ELECTORATE WOULD BE UNFAIR 
I THINK 
WOULD BE WRONG IF THE SMALL GROUP 
OF EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE OVERTURNED THE 
DECISION 
PEOPLE THAT HAVE TURNED OUT TO VOTE 
BACK AT THE UNIVERSITY JASON IS 
CHOOSING HIS LUNCH THAT HE IS 
QUALIFIED TO DO BUT CHOOSING THE
