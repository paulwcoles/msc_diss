SOME MAKE PROFITS OTHERS GO HUNGRY 
HOW MUCH LONGER CAN WE FEED THE 
WORLD 
FOOD PRICES HIGHER THAN EVER THE 
WORLD POPULATION GROWING EVER 
BIGGER THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL 
SAID TODAY THE CRISIS OF FOOD 
AVAILABILITY HAS NOW REACHED 
EMERGENCY PROPORTIONS WE GIVE OVER 
ALL OF TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME TO 
PERHAPS THE BIGGEST QUESTION OF ALL 
IS THE WAY WE MANAGE THE WORLD 
UNSUSTAINABLE THE WARNING SIGNS 
ARE CLEAR ENOUGH FOOD RIOTS IN 
THREE CONTINENTS THE PRICE OF 
WHEAT HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN THE 
LAST YEAR THE WORLD POPULATION IS 
EXPECTED TO INCREASE FROM ITS 
CURRENT SIX BILL TO NINE BILL BY 
TWO THOUSAND FIFTY ON TOP OF THAT SCIENTISTS 
TELL US THE WORLD CLIMATE IS 
CHANGING TURNING FEEPLDZ INTO 
DESERTS HERE IN BRITAIN WE THROW 
AWAY NEARLY SEVEN MILLION TONNES OF 
UNWANTED FOOD EVERY YEAR THERE HAS 
SURELY TO BE AL BETTER WAY 
GOOD EVENING THERE ARE PLACENESS 
THE WORLD WHERE HISTORY SEEMS TO BE 
RUNNING BACKWARDS CHILDREN ARE 
STOPPING GOING TO SCHOOL 
THE REASON SO THEY CAN WORK IN THE 
FIELDS BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY WAY 
THEIR FAMILY CAN EAT THE 
GOVERNMENT DECREASE WE'RE PUTTING 
AGO CULTURE PRODUCTS IN OUR PETROL 
PUCHES TODAY A PAINSTAKING 
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY WARNS THERE'S 
A LOOMING CATASTROPHE UNLESS FARM 
SOMETHING RADICALLY REFORMED 
THERE HAVE BEEN PROTESTS AROUND THE 
WORLD THE FOOD CRISIS HAS BROUGHT 
DOWN ONE GOVERNMENT IN HAITI IT 
FELL AFTER FIVE PEOPLE WERE KILLED 
IN FOOD RIOTS IN EGYPT THERE ARE 
STRIKES AND PROTESTS AFTER LARGE 
INCREASENESS THE PRICES OF SUGAR 
OIL AND PASTA AND MORE PROTESTNESS 
BANGLADESH WHERE THIRTY MILLION PEOPLE 
ARE NOW SAID TO BE AT RISK OF GOING 
WITHOUT DAILY MEALS THE CRUEL FACT 
IS THAT THE POORER YOU ARE THE MORE 
OF YOUR INCOME GOES ON FOOD AND 
THEREFORE THE HUNGRYIER YOU GO 
WHEN PRICES RISE THE LAST THREE 
YEARS GLOBAL FOOD PRICES HAVE 
ALMOST DOUBLED 
THE RAPIDLY 
ESCALATING PRICES OF FOOD 
AVAILABILITY AROUND THE WORLD HAS 
REACHED EMERGENCY PROPORTIONS THE 
WORLD BANK ESTIMATED THE DOUBLELING 
OF FOOD PRICES OVER THE LAST THREE 
YEARS COULD PUSH ONE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE 
IN LOW INCOME COUNTRIES DEEPER INTO 
POVERTY 
THE REASON IS MERELY POVERTY SUPPLY AND DEMAND USE LAND TO GROW 
BIOFUELS FOR EXAMPLE AND LESS IS 
AVAILABLE TO PRODUCE FOOD HIGH OIL 
PRICES MEAN HIGHER FOOD PRODUCTION 
COSTS WHILE MORE WEALTH IN INDIA 
AND CHINA MEANS MORE DEMAND FOR 
MEAT AND DAIRY PRODUCTS WHICH IN 
TURN DEMAND MORE GRAIN INTENSIVE 
FARMING TO CAP IT ALL THERE'S 
DROUGHT IN WHEAT PRODUCERS LIKE 
AUSTRALIA AND KAZAKHSTAN IT IS 
CHRISTMAS FOR THE SPECULATETORS AS 
PRICES DRIVE UPWARDS CORN UP BY 
THIRTY PER CENT IN THE LAST YEAR RICE SEVENTY FOUR PER CENT SOYA 
EIGHTY SEVEN PER CENT AND WHEAT BY A WHOOPING ONE HUNDRED THIRTY PER CENT 
CORRESPONDENTS ACROSS THE WORLD 
HAVE FOUND SIMILAR PICTURES HERE HERE IN DELHI THE RISING PRICE OF FOOD 
IS RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE 
POLITICAL AGENDA IN THIS MARKET 
THEY'VE SEEN RICE PRICES UP FIFTY PER CENT IN 
THE LAST YEAR PART OF THE REASON 
IS INDIA'S GROWING MIDDLE CLASS 
CONSUMING MORE BUT THIS COUNTRY'S 
HOME TO HALF THE WORLD'S HUNGRY 
FOR THEM EVEN A SMALL RISE IN THE 
PRICE OF RICE CAN MAKE A HUGE 
DIFFERENCE 
AFTER WORKING ALL DAY DIFFERENCE FROM EIGHT A M. UNTIL EIGHT P. M. IF YOU CAN'T 
EVEN HAVE SIMPLE VEGTABLE FOR YOUR 
CHILDREN EVEN IF THEY'RE JUST TWO 
KIDS IT IS VERY SAD EVERYTHING EVERYTHING GOING UP AT THE MOMENT THERE'S 
LITTLE GOOD NEWS 
WHAT WILL THAT 
MEAN FOR INDIA 
A LOT OF PROBLEMS 
INDIA'S RESPONSE IS TO BAN THE 
EXPORT OF SOME TYPES OF RICE AND 
CUT SOME IMPORT DUTIES BUT IF FOOD 
DEMAND CONTINUES TO GROW FASTER 
THAN FOOD PRODUCTION WHEN THEN THE 
FUTURE COULD BE SHORTAGES HUNGER 
AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SOCIAL 
UNREST 
HERE IN BEIJING CHINA'S MAIN WORRY 
IS SIMPLE IT IS THE SAME WORRY 
THIS COUNTRY'S HAD FOR DECADES AND 
DECADES HOW ON EARTH DO YOU FEED 
THE WORLD'S BIGGEST POPULATION 
RUMOUR IT IS SUCH A BIG WORRY 
YEARS AGO THE COUNTRY INTRODUCED 
ONE CHILD POLICY TO KEEP THE 
NUMBERS DOWN TO MAKE SURE THERE'S 
ENOUGH FOOD FOR EVERYONE HUNDREDS 
OF PEOPLE ARE LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY 
AND THIS IS THE KIND OF FOOD THEY 
CAN AFFORD TO BUY MEAT SOMETHING 
THEY COULDN'T AFFORD YEARS AGO BUT 
THERE'S PROBLEM L. WANT TO 
ILLUSTRATE THIS IT BY COMING TO THE 
STALL OF THE BUTCHER HERE A YEAR 
AGO I COULD COME HERE AND BUY 
KILO OF PORK FOR EIGHTY PENCE OR SO 
NOW ONE YEAR LATER PRICES HAVE 
DOUBLED IF I WANT A KILO OF PORK 
I WOULD HAVE TO PAY ONE POINT SIX OH SHE'S 
ANGRY BECAUSE FEWER PEOPLE ARE 
COMING TO THE STORE AND PEOPLE ARE 
ANGRY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD 
THIS ANY MORE THAT WORRIES THE 
CHINESE GOVERNMENT 
HERE IN EGYPT THE PRICES OF SOME 
BASIC FOODS LIKE RICE PASTA AND 
OIL HAVE ALMOST DOUBLED OVER THE 
PAST YEAR IT MEANS THAT MORE 
FAMILIES HAVE HAD TO RELY ON THIS 
BREAD WHICH IS HEAVILY SUBSIDISED 
BY THE STATE THE PRICE OF ONE OF 
THESE LOAVES IS JUST HALF A PENNY 
A FRACTION OF ITS REAL COST TO THE 
GOVERNMENT IN RECENT WEEKS THERE 
HAVE BEEN LONG QUEUES IN FRONT OF 
BAKERIES PROVOKING LOUD COMPLAINTS 
ALL THE PRICE ARE GOING UP THIS TIME LAST YEAR THERE 
WAS NO PROBLEM GETTING BREAD BUT 
NOW IT HAS BECOME MUCH MORE 
DIFFICULT 
RISING PRICES HAVE EVEN DIFFICULT CAUSED RIOTS IN THE NILE DELTA TWO 
PEOPLE WERE KILLED WHEN POLICE 
CLASHED WITH WORKERS DEMANDING 
BETTER PAY THE GOVERNMENT HERE IS 
WORRIED ABOUT SOCIAL UNREST SO IT 
HAS BEEN TRYING TO SOFTEN THE 
IMPACT OF THE PRICE RISES IT ADDED 
SOME FIFTEEN MILLION NAMES FOR THE 
PEOPLE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE 
SUBSIDISED FOOD SO IN THE SHORT 
TERM NEED IS MONEY FOR FOOD THE U. S. 
HAS RELEASED TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF 
EMERGENCY FOOD AID AND GORDON BROWN 
HAD THIS TO SAY AHEAD OF A MEETING 
WITH GEORGE BUSH 
I THINK WE HAVE 
TO DOING SOMETHING ABOUT OIL PRICES 
AND ABOUT FOOD PRICES L. THINK IF 
THE WORLD ACTS TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE 
A DIFFERENCE TO THIS 
BUT THE 
BIGGER LONGER TERM QUESTION IS 
WHETHER WE CAN ANY LONGER AFFORD TO 
RUN THE WORLD IN THE WAY WE DO 
WELL THE SHORT TERM SEQUENCE OF THE 
FOOD PRIZE SPIRAL IS THAT EVEN IF 
DONORS CAN BE PERSUADE TODAY TOUCH 
UP THE MONEY THE EMERGENCY AID 
WILL BUY LESS AND LESS LONGER TERM 
FOUR HUNDRED EXPERTS BACKED BY SOME OF THE 
MOST POWERFUL UN ORGANISATIONS WHO 
SPENT FIVE YEARS THINKING ABOUT IT 
SAY THE CURRENT SYSTEM CAN'T LAST 
AGO CULTURE REPRESENTS ALMOST A 
THIRD OF ALL GREENHOUSE GAS 
EMISSIONS AND STILL MALNUTRITION IS 
RIFE IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD 
THERE ARE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PAGE MESSAGE TO 
GOVERNMENT IS SOMETHING HAS TO 
CHANGE BUT TO WHAT OU SCIENCE 
EDITOR SUSAN WATTS REPORTS OUR 
THE AUTHORS OF TODAY'S AMBITIOUS 
PLAN TO DEVISE A GLOBAL BLUEPRINT 
FOR THE FUR OF AGO CULTURE SAY LOOK 
AROUND YOU EVERYTHING THAT CAUSES 
TODAY'S CRISIS CAN GET WORSE WE 
WILL HAVE NINE BILLION MOUTHS TO 
FEED BY TWO THOUSAND FIFTY AND WE HAVE TO DO THAT 
WITHOUT DESTROYING THE RESOURCES WE 
DEMEND ON SOME SAY THIS REPORT HAS 
LAND AT JUST THE RIGHT TIME AND 
FORMER CHIEF SCIENTIST AT THE 
WORPLD BANK PROFESSOR BOB WATSON 
CHAIRED THE PANEL ON CHIEMENT 
CHANGE UNTIL THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T LIKE WHAT HE 
WAS SAYING NOW HIS MISSION IS TO 
SORT OUT FARMING HE WANTS A 
WHOLESALE RETHINK 
AGO CULTURE IS 
COMPLEX IT IS NOT JUST PRODUCTION 
IT IS HOW DO WE MAKE IT SUSTAINABLE 
FROM A SOCIAL PROSPECTIVE TAKE 
INTO ACCOUNT GENDER ISSUES AND 
SOCIAL ISSUES IT IS AN 
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE HOW DO WE 
PRODUCE FOOD WITHOUT CREATING 
BIODIVERSITY AND CAUSING CLIMATE 
CHANGE IT IS A KEY ISSUE IF WE 
LOOK AT ONE PART OF THE SYSTEM WE 
WILL NOT SUCCEED SO WE HAVE TO 
PLACE AGO CULTURE WITHIN THE 
CONTEXT OF THE ECONOMIC FRAMEWORK 
SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FRAMEWORK 
SO HOW DO THOSE FROM THE TWO POLAR 
EXTREMES OF THE FOOD DEBATE SEE THE 
FUTURE IN SIMPLE FERMS THOSE FROM 
THE SCIENTIFIC OR MAINSTREAM VIEW 
OF AGO CULTURE OR THOSE FROM THE 
ORGANIC APPROACH STPOOFPLT PEOPLE 
COME TO LOOK AT THIS FIELD IT IS 
CLASSICAL PRANT BREEDING EXPERIMENT 
A PLANT TREATED WITH DIFFERENT 
TYPES OF FERTILISERS IT WAS THIS 
POST WAR APPROACH THAT LAY THE 
FOUNDATIONS OF THE FIRST GREEN 
REVOLUTION THE LAST TIME 
SCIENTISTS STEPPED UP PRODUCTION 
AND CAME TO THE RESCUE OF A HUNGRY 
WORLD THIS ARCHIVE OF JARS AND 
BOTTLES IS THE ATA FROM THAT 
FAMOUS FIELD WORK ONE HUNDRED SIX YEARS WORTH 
OF SOIL AND CROPS WHICH SCIENTISTS 
HERE SAY IS PROOF IT IS POSSIBLE TO 
TREAT THE SAME PLOT OF LAND OVER 
AND OVER AGAIN WITH CHEMICAL 
FERTILISERS AND STEADILY INCREASE 
YIELDS THAT'S THE PHILOSOPHICAL 
HEART OF THE GREEN REVOLUTION IS 
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WE NEED A 
SECOND GREEN REVOLUTION NOTHING NOTHING SHOULD BE OFF LIMITS WE SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO USE ALL OF THE POWER OF 
GENETICS PLANT BREEDING CHEMISTRY 
AND OF COURSE ADVANCED ENGINEERING 
TECHNOLOGIES AND THESE DAYS AIDED 
SIGNIFICANTLY BY MATHEMATICAL 
APPROACHES TO MODELLING SYSTEMS AND 
ADVANCE COME PEWATIONAL TECHNIQUE 
THIS IS THE CHALLENGE TO BRING ALL 
THE THINGS TO BEAR TO WHAT IS 
UNDOUBTLY THE BALANCE BETWEEN LET'S 
CALL IT NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS AND THE 
PRODUCTIVITY THAT WE KNOW WE NEED 
TO FEED NINE BILLION PEOPLE IN THE 
COMING PERIOD 
TONE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN BEHIND A 
WAR COUNT EARLIER THIS YEAR BY THE 
BIOTECH COMPANIES 
IT IT'S ATTENTION THAT HAS RUN 
RIGHT THROUGH THIS FIVE YEAR 
PROCESS MANY SCIENTISTS TEND TO BE 
REPRESENTIVE TO G. M. TECHNOLOGIES AND 
DISMISSIVE OF ORGANIC FARMING AS 
TOO SMALL SCALE TO BE RELEVANT 
THIS IS PART OF A NETWORK OF 
CORRIGANIC FARMS DELIVERING BOXES 
OF VEGETABLES TO FIFTY THOUSAND FAMILIES 
AWEEK CROSS THE U. K. IT IS 
BUSINESS WITH AN ANNUAL TURNOVER OF 
THIRTY FIVE MILLION IT IS RELATIVELY SMALL 
SCALE BUT ORGANIC FARMERS SAY THEY 
COULD FEED GROWING WORLD 
POPULATION IF GIVEN THE CHANCE 
THEY ALSO SAY THEIRS IS THE ONLY 
TRULY SUSTAINABLE APPROACH TO 
AGRICULTURE BECAUSE THEY USE LESS 
OIL BASED TECHNOLOGY SO MINIMISE 
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 
SOME OF 
THESE WILL GO A FOOT DEEP THEY 
BRING AIR BACK INTO THE STOIL 
SUSTAIN LIFE 
ROB HEYWORTH SAYS 
ORGANIC FARMING BASED ON CREATING 
AND KEEPING SOILS FERTILE WITHOUT 
ADDING CHEMICALS IS THE OBVIOUS 
CHOICE FOR THE DEVELOPING WORLD 
FRPBL WE ARE IN AN INCREDIBLE 
SITUATION WITH ORGANIC FARMING 
ACROSS THE WORLD THERE ARE FIFTY ONE 
MILLION HECTARES THERE IS ORGANIC 
FARMERS OVER THE WORLD THAT ARE 
SAYING THIS WORKS IN PRACTICE IF I 
WAS THEM I WOULD BE QUESTIONING 
WHETHER I WOULD WANT TO GO DOWN A 
ROUTE OF BEING DEPENDANT ON 
EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS FROM WESTERN 
COMPANIES WHEN WE HAVE SHOWN IT IS 
A FARMING SYSTEM THAT WORKS IT IS 
SOMETHING THAT THE PUBLIC AND 
COMMUNITIES WANT WITH EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION 
PEOPLE JUST OVER TEN PER CENT OF THE WORLD'S 
POPULATION MALL NOURISHED THE 
REPORT WANTS GOVERNMENTS TO SPEND 
MORE PUBLIC MONEY ON SCIENCE AND 
TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH IN DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES WHERE PRIVATE SECTOR 
INVESTMENT IS ALMOST NON EXISTANT 
TO FOCUS MORE ON STRESSED LAND LIKE 
OUR GLOBAL FISHERIES DRY LAND 
MOUNTAINS AND COASTAL SYSTEMS TO 
SHIFT THE FOCUS FROM PRODUCTION 
TECHNOLOGIES TO MAKE FOOD INTO WAY 
THAT IS DON'T MAKE CLIMATE CHANGE 
WORSE 
THAT IS DON'T MAKE CLIMATE CHANGE WORSE CRITICS SAY THEY HAVE HEARD 
ALL OF THIS BEFORE AND THAT WITH 
PLENTY OF PEOPLE ALREADY TRYING TO 
SORT THESE ISSUES OUT THERE WAS 
REALLY NO NEED FOR THIS REPORT AT 
ALL 
I HAVE A PROBLEM IN THAT THERE ALL IS NO REAL SOLID TAKE HOME MESSAGE 
FROM THE REPORT THAT REALLY IS 
GOING TO MAKE GOVERNMENTS SIT UP 
AND THINK WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT 
THIS BEFORE WE REALLY NEED TO DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
IT HAS MANY SORT OF SORT OF 
SECONDARY LEVEL MESSAGES MANY WHICH 
WE WOULD GO ALONG WITH MANY WHICH 
ARE FAMILIAR THE REPORT WOULD HAVE 
HAD MORE IMPACT IF IT CAME OUT AND 
SAID WE HAVE TO DO THIS WE MUST 
STOP DOING THAT L. CAN'T SEE THAT 
IN THE REPORT AS IT STANDS 
ALREADY BOB WATSON IS HAVING SOME 
OF THE PROBLEMS HE HAD WITH CLIMATE 
CHANGE SIXTY COUNTRIES HAVE SIGNED 
OFF ON HIS REPORT THE U. S. CANADA 
AND AUSTRALIA HAVEN'T AMERICA 
WANTED LESS ON THE DOWN SIDES OF 
FREE TRADE AND MORE POSITIVE NOISES 
ON G. M. CROPS THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT 
HAVE YET TO SIGN UP WITH BIOTECH 
COMPANIES AND FOOD PRODUCERS ABSENT 
FROM THIS DEBATE IT IS AN OPEN 
QUESTION WHAT IMPACT THIS REPORT 
WILL HAVE IN THE REAL WORLD I'M 
JOINED NOW IN THE STUDIO BY THE 
LEAD SCIENTIST OF THE REPORT 
PROFESSOR ROBERT WATSON 
LORD MELT CHET AND DOCTOR KEITH JONES 
THIS WAS A WASTE OF EFFORT IF THE 
AMERICANS THE CANADIANS AND THE 
AUSTRALIANS AREN'T SIGNED UP TO AND 
THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS YET TO 
DO SO 
NOT AT ALL EVEN THE U. S. 
GOVERNMENT HAS STRONGLY ENDORSED 
MANY PARTS OF THE REPORT THEY HAVE 
TWO CONCERNS THEY ARE NOT 
CONVINCED ABOUT WHAT WE WAS SAID 
ABOUT TRADE AT THE MOMENT THERE IS 
NOT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD ON TRADE 
THEY DON'T THINK WE ARE POSITIVE 
ENOUGH ON G. M. CROPS OTHER THAN THAT 
THERE IS OTHER FAS SETS THEY HAVE 
SIGNED UP TO I'M CONVINCED THE U. K. 
GOVERNMENT WILL STRONGLY ENDORSE 
THIS REPORT AND USE IT 
IN SUMMARY 
GIVEN WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW THESE 
RIOTS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD 
IS THAT A TEMPORARY PHENOMEMON IN 
YOUR JUDGEMENT WILL WE SEE MORE OF 
THAT 
HIGHER ENERGY PRICES MORE THAT LAND USE FOR BIOFUELS INCREASE IN 
DEMAND FOR CHIENNAFPLT MORE CLIMATE 
VARIABILITY WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND 
THE SHORT TERM NEEDS THESE ARE 
UNDERMINING LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE 
SOMETHING WE SHOULD GET USED TO 
ISSUES WE MUST ADDRESS COMPLETELY 
WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR SYSTEM MORE 
CLIMATE FRIENDLY BIOFUELS ARE 
SUSTAINABLE AND UNDERSTAND HOW TO 
MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK 
KEITH JONES 
WHY DIDN'T YOU AGREE TO PACK TAKE 
PART IN THIS MAJOR PIECE OF WORK 
WELL WE DID TAKE PART FROM THE 
VERY BEGINNING UNFORTUNATELY THE 
OUTPUT WE FEEL UNDER ESTIMATES 
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THE ROLE 
THAT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MAKES 
IN INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY IN 
FEEDING THE POOR L. CAN GIVE AN 
EXAMPLE THERE IF WE LOOK WE SAW 
EGYPT THERE I WORKED IN EEMENT TWENTY 
YEARS AGO NINETEEN EIGHTIES RICE PRODUCTION 
WAS BEING BUILT UP VERY LOW YIELDS 
ONLY FUTONS PER HEALTH SECRETARY 
AIR NOW MORE THAN TEN TONNES PER 
HECTARE OF RICE IN EGYPT THE 
HIGHEST PRODUCTIVITY IN THE WORLD 
WHY IS THAT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
IS IT YOUR CONTENTION THE PROBLEM 
COULD BE SOLVED BY TECHNOLOGY 
TECHNOLOGY WILL PROVIDE A LOT OF 
THE ANSWERS IT IS NOT A SILVER 
BULLET BULLET IT'S NOT JUST BIOTECHNOLOGY WILL IS 
A RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES 
IN THAT 
CASE YOUR GUT OPPOSITION TO IT IS 
RATHER SILLY ISN'T IT 
NO BECAUSE 
WHAT I THINK THE REPORT HAS DONE 
IT'S AN ENORMOUS VALUABLE AND 
IMPORTANT 
IT IS CERTAINLY 
ENORMOUS 
IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT ENORMOUS STARTED TO CHANGE THE DEBATE ABOUT 
FOOD REFRAME IT TO TAKE INTO 
ACCOUNT THE EKE LOGICAL LIMITS AND 
THE NEED NOT JUST TO DEAL WITH 
CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS IMPACTS BUT 
TO REDUCE OUR DEPENDANCE ON OIL 
NON ORGANIC FARM SOMETHING TURNING 
OIL INTO FOOD THAT IS CLEARLY 
UNSUSTAINABLE IT CANNOT DO IT 
USING ARTIFICIAL NITROGEN 
FERTILISERS WE HAVE AS THE REPORT 
RIGHTLY SAYS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT 
ENVIRONMENT CONSTRAINTS ONE THING 
THAT HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED SO FAR 
THE HUGE DAMAGE TO OUR HEALTH WHICH 
THE SORT OF FOOD AND FARMING 
SYSTEMS WE HAVE IN DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES ARE DOING 
THIS IS 
IT IS A BIG JOB 
A HUGE 
SUBJECT LET'S STEER OFF THE HEALTH 
QUESTION SIMPLY OF POPULATION 
GROWTH IS THERE ANY SOLUTION THAT 
DOESN'T INVOLVE MASSIVE USE OF 
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY WHEN YOU 
HAVE FIFTY PER CENT PROJECTED POPULATION 
GROWTH IN THE WORLD BY TWO THOUSAND FIFTY 
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IS CRITICAL 
IT IS NOT JUST THE POPULATION ISSUE 
IT'S THE FACT THAT CHINA AND INDIA 
ARE BECOMING MUCH WEALTHIER AS 
PERSON GOES FROM ONE DOLLAR TO TWO 
DOLLARS THEY CAN AFFORD MORE FOOD 
MORE NUTRITIONIOUS FOOD MORE MEAT 
ONE TON OF BEEF TAKES NINE TONNES 
BY THAT ARGUMENT WE SHOULD BECOME 
VEG TEARANS 
NO WE NEEDED TO THINK 
HOW TO BECOME SUSTAINABLE 
AGRICULTURE IS MORE THAN SIMPLY 
SIMPLY PRODUCTION YOU HAVE TO TAKE 
INTO SOCIAL EKE LOGICAL AND 
ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES THIS 
CHALLENGE CAN BE MET 
IT IS NOT A 
DEBATE BETWEEN SCIENCE AND ANTI 
SCIENCE SCIENCE PLAYS A CRUCIAL 
ROLE IN TELLING US ABOUT CLIMATE 
CHANGES AND SOLUTIONS AND INFORMING 
MODERN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE IT HAS 
BEEN STARVED OF RESEARCH WE HAVE TO 
MAKE CHOICES ABOUT THE ROUTE WE 
TAKE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE WIDER 
ISSUES IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT UPPING 
YIELD WHICH IS HOW WE HAVE RUN 
AGRICULTURE POLICY FOR YEARS NOT 
IF YOU HAVE TO POUR OIL INTO THE 
GROUND THROUGH NITROGEN FERTILISER 
UP TO THE YIELDS IT IS NOT 
SUSTAINABLE IT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE 
ENVIRONMENTALLY OR ECONOMICLY FOR 
POORER FARMERS AS THE REPORT SAYS 
HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THIS ISSUE 
THROUGH SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
WOULD ARGUE YOU HAVE TO USE 
FERTILISER YOU HAVE IMPROVED 
VARIETIES THAT ALLOW YOU TO TARGET 
THAT FERTILISER IT ALLOWS THE 
PLANTS TO USE IT MORE EFFECTIVELY 
WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE YOU CAN'T 
USE ORGANIC AGRICULTURE 
WHY NOT IT IT DOES NOT PRODUCE ENOUGH FOOD THAT THAT IS THE SIMPLE ANSWER CAN YOU NOT 
DO IT OR BEGANICALLY 
YOU WOULD 
HAVE TO PLOUGH UP MORE LAND PROT 
DUCTTIVITY IS THE SO MUCH LOWER IS IS THERE ENOUGH LAND TO DO IT OR 
BEGANICALLY 
YES THERE IS THERE IS BEGANICALLY A PUBLISHED PAPER BY A GROUP OF 
EMINENT SCIENCES USES WHICH 
SUGGESTED IF THE WHOLE WORLD WENT 
ORGANIC WE WOULD HAVE SLIGHTLY MORE 
FOOD WE NEED ALSO TO ADDRESS WHAT 
SORT OF FOOD WE FOOD WE EEAT 
SOME FORMS OF FOOD PRODUCTION LIKE 
MEAT PRODUCTION PARTICULARLY USING 
CEREALS AND PULSES IS VERY 
UNSUSTAINABLE AND VERY ENERGY 
INTENSIVE WE HAVE TO HAVE A 
HEALTHIER DIET THAT IS WHY HEALTH 
IS IMPORTANT AND MORE SUSTAINABLE 
DIET THESE ARE WIN WINS 
EVERYTHING HAS A ROLE TO PLAY 
ORGANIC AGRICULTURE HAS A ROLE HI 
TECH HAS A ROLE IN ITS PLACE WE ARE 
NOT ANTI SCIENCE IT IS PRO SCIENCE 
WE EVEN BELIEVE WE HAVE TO CONSIDER 
TRANCE AGAINIC TECHNOLOGY IF 
NEEDED TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE 
ISSUES OF NEW VACCINE FOR EMERGING 
ANIMAL DISEASES IT IS CONCEIVABLE 
THE DROUGHT RESISTANT CROPS MAY 
NEED TO THINK IT THROUGH THE BASIC 
POINT WE MAKE WHEN WE INCREASE 
PRODUCTIVITY WE MUST LOOK AT THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS AND 
SOCIAL IMPLICATION WE HAVE PRO 
SCIENCE DOCUMENT HERE THAT LOOKS 
ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF TECHNOLOGIES 
LET'S ALL AGREE THE EUROPEAN UNION 
COMMON AGRICULTURE POLICY NOT VERY 
HELPFUL IS IT 
THE EUROPEAN POLICY 
IS MOVING AWAY FROM PRODUCTION 
SUBSIDIES IT IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION TO RECOGNISE THAT THE 
FARMER NOT ONLY NEEDS TO PRODUCE 
LAND FOOD FROM THE LAND BUT NEEDS 
TO PROVIDE GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS THE 
POINT ONE WOULD IS WE ARE MOVING IN 
THE RIGHT DIRECTION WHAT WE NEED 
ON A LARGER SCALE TO MAKE SURE WE 
HAVE ALLEVEL PLAYING FIELD SO THE 
POOREST OF THE POOR FARMERS ALSO 
GAIN FROM LIBERALISATION OF TRADE 
WOULD GO SOME WAY TO SOLVING THIS 
PROBLEM ABSOLUTELY WE HAVE TO 
HAVE MARKET MECHANISMS 
LIBERALISATION AS A TRADE AS AN 
INDUSTRY WE ARE FOR FREE TRADE AND 
VERY MUCH FOR HAVING TRADE WITHOUT 
SUBSIDIES THAT ARE BARRIERS TO 
TRADE WE WITHOUT SUBSIDIES THAT DO 
NOT HELP PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY SURVIVE 
AND GROW FOOD 
WHAT WE ARE AGAINST ONE OF THE 
THINGS IF WE BRING UP THE EUROPEAN 
UNION IS NON TARIFF BARRIERS TO 
TRADE WHICH DON'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO 
ENTER MARKETS DON'T ALLOW THEM TO 
GET ACCESS TO THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT 
THEY WANT BECAUSE THEY ARE WORRIED 
THAT THEY THEN WON'T BE ABLE TO 
SELL THEIR PRODUCTS INTO THE 
MARKETS 
IN THE END EVERY MARKETS GOVERNMENT IS ELECTED OR CHOOSES TO 
LOOK AFTER THE INTERESTS OF ITS 
CITIZENS THAT IS ITS PRIMARY DUTY 
HOW DO YOU PERSUADE GOVERNMENTS TO 
RAISE THEIR GAME AND LOOK AT IT 
INTERNATIONALLY FRANKLY THIS 
ISN'T REALLY YET A PROBLEM THAT 
AFFECTS US 
I THINK YOU ARE RAISING 
A DILEMMA WHICH DOESN'T EXIST 
BECAUSE IN THE FUTURE WHERE WE HAVE 
TO CUT OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 
CUT OUR ENERGY USE WILL INVOLVE 
LESS TRANSPORT THE FIRST PRIORITY 
FOR EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD 
DEVELOPED OR DEVELOPING IN AFRICA 
OR EUROPE TO PRODUCE WHAT FOOD THEY 
CAN EFFICIENTLY AT HOME ONLY THEN 
LOOK TO TRADE THAT WILL PROVIDE 
THE FOOD SECURITY WHICH GOVERNMENTS 
ARE ELECTED FOR IT WILL ALSO 
STOORT GIVE US ENVIRONMENTAL 
SECURITY FOR THE PLANET 
THESE ARE 
INTERNATIONAL GLOBAL ISSUES WE 
CAN'T ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE 
WITHOUT WORKING TOGETHER WE CAN'T 
ADDRESS FOOD SECURITY SELF 
INTEREST IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THE 
WHOLE ISSUE OF SECURITY CLIMATE 
CHANGE FOR EXAMPLE AND FOOD 
SECURITY IMPACTS ON US BOTH 
DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY IT IS IN 
SELF INTEREST OF THE UNITED KINGDOM 
TO WORK WITH EUROPE AND POOR 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
IF YOU COULD 
ALL URGE GOVERNMENT AND GET 
GOVERNMENT TO DO ONE THING 
IMMEDIATELY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE 
WHAT WOULD IT BE 
IT WOULD BE TWO 
THINGS CONTINUE TO IN AGRICULTURE 
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND MAKE THE 
TRADING SYSTEM WORK FOR THE POOREST 
OF POOR 
TO PUT TOWARDS THE 
INSTITUTIONAL FRAME WORK THAT 
ALLOWS FARMERS TO GET ACCESS TO THE 
KNOWLEDGE THE SCIENCE AND THE 
TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY REQUIRE TO 
MAKE THE DECISIONS TO IMPROVE THEIR 
OWN LIVELIHOODS 
I WOULD SAY TO 
START TO PLAN SERIOUSLY THIS IS 
WHERE I WELCOME THE REPORT AND 
INCIDENTLY GORDON BROWN HAS A 
REVIEW LOOKING AT THIS WHICH 
MIRROR AS LOT OF WHAT BOB'S REPORT 
SAYS FROM THE CABINET OFFICE TO 
START SERIOUSLY TO WORK OUT HOW WE 
WILL FEEL FEED OURSELVES IN A WORLD 
WHERE WE HAVE TO CUT AGREE HOUSE 
GAS EMISSIONS BY EIGHTY PER CENT AND WE CAN'T 
AAHAVE OIL AND GAS TO PRODUCE OUR 
FOODS AND WHICH PROVIDE US WITH 
DECENT FOOD WHICH IS FUND FUN TO 
EAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
IN SOCIETY'S LIKE OURS 
SPECIFICALLY IN OUR SOCIETY VAST 
QUANTITIES OF FOOD AREN'T BEING 
EATEN THEY'RE BEING PRODUCED 
SIMPLY TO BE THROWN AWAY 
PAUL DOESN'T MIND BUYING HIS FOOD 
IT'S JUST HE DOESN'T NEED TO HE 
GETS IT DIRECTLY FROM THE BINS OF 
SUPERMARKETS 
WHAT DATE HAVE WE GOT SUPERMARKETS APRIL THIRD TODAY IS THE SECOND THIS THIS EXPEDITION ONE OF SEVERAL HE'LL 
MAKE THIS EVENING YIELDS THREE 
BAGS OF FRESH FOOD ALL WITHIN ITS 
SELL BY DATE THAT WAS A SUCCESSFUL 
TRIP 
YES NOT TOO BAD THANKS FOR TRIP FIVE OR TEN MINUTES JAUNT INTO THE 
BIN 
YOU'RE SCAVENGING AREN'T YOU BIN IT DEPENDS WHAT YOU MEAN BY 
SCAVENGING SAVING IT FROM LANDFILL 
SAVING PERFECTLY GOOD FOOD THAT'S 
COME FROM EGYPT AND FRANCE AND ALL 
SORTS OF OTHER PLACES 
IT'S SUPPER 
TIME NOW WITH THE FOOD THAT WOULD 
OTHERWISE HAVE GONE TO WASTE 
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY CRUDE ABOUT 
THE WAY WE DEAL WITH RUBBISH IN 
THIS COUNTRY WE DIG A LARGE HOLE 
AND THEN WE FILL IT WE MAY BE 
RECYCLING MORE THAN EVER BUT WE 
STILL SEND MORE WASTE TO LANDFILL 
THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN EUROPE 
NOW THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST PLASTIC 
BAGS MAY HAVE PROMPTED SOME SOUL 
SEARCHING BUT IN FACT THE AMOUNT 
OF THESE WE BURY IS DWARFED BY 
SOMETHING MUCH MORE COSTLY TO THE 
ENVIRONMENT SOMETHING WE ALL THROW 
AWAY ALL THE TIME FOOD THIS IS 
WHERE IT COMES TO A RUBBISH 
MOUNTAIN THIS ONE IS BEING PILED 
UP JUST NORTH OF BIRMINGHAM WASTE 
MANAGERS ESTIMATE THAT EIGHTY PER CENT OF WHAT 
GETS TIPPED HERE COULD BE RECYCLED 
A LOT OF IT IS FOOD AS IT ROTS IT 
GENERATES METHANE A GREENHOUSE GAS 
THAT'S OVER TWENTY TIMES MORE DAMAGING 
THAN C. O. TWO 
MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT 
THROWING AWAY FOOD IS BENEFICIAL TO 
THE PLANET IT ROTS IT BIODEGLADES 
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE IS THE 
PROBLEM WE'VE GOT SIXTY MILLION 
PEOPLE CONSUMING ABOUT THIRTY MILLION 
TONS OF FOOD EACH YEAR IT'S BEEN 
CALCULATED THAT EACH TON OF THAT 
FOOD CONSUMPTION IS ABSORBING AS 
MUCH AS TWENTY TONS OF THE PLANET'S 
RESOURCES 
IT COSTS SO MUCH TO RESOURCES PRODUCE FOOD AND YET WE THROW SO 
MUCH OF IT AWAY 
FOR EVERY THREE 
SHOPPING BAGS OF FOOD THAT WE BUY 
ONE OF THEM WE PUT STRAIGHT IN THE 
BIN MOST OF THAT FOOD WE COULD 
HAVE EATEN NOW THAT'S COSTING US A 
LOT OF MONEY WE RECKON IT'S 
COSTING ABOUT EIGHT BILLION A YEAR 
HOUSEHOLDERS FROM LUDLOW IN 
SHROPSHIRE ARE TAKING PART IN 
TRIAL THE IDEA IS TO ENCOURAGE 
THEM TO CUT THE AMOUNT OF FOOD 
THROWN OUT AND TO DITCH THE BLACK 
BIN CULTURE WE'VE ALL COME TO RELY 
ON EACH WEEK UNWANTED FOOD IS 
COLLECTED FROM A SEPARATE BIN 
EVERY HOUSEHOLD HAS ONE AH LONG 
WITH FREE BIODEGLADABLE BAGS THE 
SUCCESS OF THE SCHEME DEPENDS ON 
THE WILLINGNESS OF FAMILIES LIKE 
KIM'S 
TRY NOT TO PREPARE AS MUCH KIM'S FOOD BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'RE MORE 
CONSCIOUS OF HOW MUCH YOU'RE 
WASTING 
HER KIDS ARE ENCOURAGED TO WASTING EAT EVERYTHING ON THEIR PLATE DO DO YOU THINK YOU WASTE LOTS OF FOOD 
YEAH BUT I ONLY HAVE A SMALL TUMMY 
AND IF A TUMMY REALLY IS TOO SMALL 
THEN IT'S BECOME THE NORM TO MAKE 
SURE THE LEFTOVERS ARE COLLECTED 
SEPARATELY THE FOOD IS BROUGHT TO 
AN INDUSTRIAL ESTATE ON THE EDGE OF 
TOWN TO THE AN AROBIC DIGESTER 
HELD UP AS A NEW SOLUTION TO A 
GROWING AND LARGELY UNACKNOWLEDGED 
PROBLEM ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD BIN WOULD CONTAIN 
ASHES FATHERS AND BONES THESE 
DAYS TWENTY PER CENT A FIFTH OF IT IS FRESH 
FOOD UNEATEN WASTED NEW FIGURES 
FROM WRAP THE GOVERNMENT WASTE 
AGENCY SHOW FOR THE FIRST TIME 
JUST WHAT WE'RE CHUCKING OUT FORTY PER CENT 
OF THE FOOD IS FRUIT AND VEG SO 
MUCH FOR OUR FIVE A DAY MOST OF IT 
IS THROWN AWAY WHOLE INCLUDING 
NEARLY FORTY FIVE MILLION APRIL APPLES 
OVER FIVE MILLION POTATOES AND A 
ONE POINT FIVE MILLION BANANAS 
IT'S TWO 
THINGS ONE IS WE DON'T STORE IT 
PROPERLY AND THEREFORE IT GOES OUT 
OF DATE OR WE COOK TOO MUCH AND IT 
GETS THROWN AWAY AT THE END OF A 
MEAL SO PORTION CONTROL ISN'T 
RIGHT THOSE ARE THE TWO PRINCIPAL 
REASONS FOR THREING AWAY FOOD 
WE'RE IN THE AWARE WE'RE DOING IT 
WE'VE GOT OURSELVES INTO THE HABIT 
OF TREATING FOOD LIKE THIS WE'RE 
NOT AWARE OF IT 
THE ANAEROBIC 
DIGESTER CONVERTS FOOD SCRAPS INTO 
ENERGY IT'S A SORT OF ROBO COP OF 
FOOD WASTE TURNING A PROBLEM INTO A 
FORCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL GOOD IT IT ACTS AS A BALANCING A BELL LOWS 
EFFECTIVELY BEFORE THE GAS GOES 
INTO THE BUILDING WHERE IT RUNS THE 
ENGINE TO PRODUCE THE ELECTRICITY 
IT'S LIKE A VIRTUOUS CIRCLE W. H. A. 
COMES IN GOES OUT IN NEW USABLE FORM 
WE'RE RECYCLING THE FOOD FORM WASTE INTO BIOFERTILISER AND BIOGAS 
THAT'S ALL WE'RE NOT ADDING 
ANYTHING TO THE PROCESS IT'S 
NATURAL AND THE BIOGAS IN TURN IS 
CONVERTED INTO ELECTRICITY AND HEAT 
THE PLANT CAN HANDLE JUST FIVE THOUSAND 
TONS OF FOOD WASTE IN A YEAR FROM 
THIRTY THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS RENOWNED FOR ITS 
RESTAURANTS CHAMPION OF LOCAL 
PRODUCE IT'S NO SURPRISE A TOWN 
LIKE LUDLOW CAN FIND 
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WAYS TO 
DEAL WITH FOOD WASTE HOW REALISTIC 
IS IT TO THINK THAT SOLUTION THAT'S 
WORK IN A PLACE LIKE THIS CAN BE 
ADOPTED ELSEWHERE PARTICULARLY 
WHEN THE TRADITIONAL METHOD OF 
DISPOSAL IS ALSO THE CHEAPEST THAT 
IS CHANGING LANDFILL TAXES ARE 
RISING EACH YEAR FINALLY GIVING 
WASTE MANAGERS FINANCIAL 
INCENTIVE TO INVEST IN NEW METHODS 
WE CAN MAKE A VERY GOOD LIVING HERE 
AT ABOUT 
BY TWO THOUSAND TEN WE'LL ONLY BE EQUIVALENT TO 
REACHING THE ECONOMICS FOR NEW TECH 
NOLJILZ 
MANY COUNCILS ARE TURNING NOLJILZ TO AN OLD TECHNOLOGY INCINERATION 
COSTLY TO SET UP THEY LIKE IT ANY 
WAY BECAUSE IT CAN DEAL WITH 
MASSIVE VOLUMES OF WASTE AND 
ATTRACTS GOVERNMENT FUNDING BUT 
ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGNERS SAY IT'S 
NO SOLUTION 
IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT 
THE BEST THING TO DO FROM A CLIMATE 
POINT OF VIEW AND FROM TRYING TO BE 
AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE WITH THE 
WORLD'S SCARCE RESOURCES IS TO MAKE 
SURE WE'RE RECYCLING AS MUCH AS 
POSSIBLE AND PREVENTING WASTE WHAT 
TENDS TO HAPPEN WITH LANDFILL TAXES 
IS THAT PEOPLE GO FROM ONE NOT VERY 
GOOD SOLUTION LANDFILL TO ANOTHER 
NOT VERY GOOD SOLUTION 
INCINERATION 
THE GOVERNMENT IS INCINERATION PROMOTING RECYCLING AS THE BEST WAY 
TO DEAL WITH OUR CASTOFFS THE 
BUDGET OF ITS AGENCY WRAP HAS BEEN 
CUT BY A THIRD LEAD TO QUESTIONS 
ABOUT HOW COMMITTED IT IS TO NEW 
AND GREENER METHODS OF DISPOSAL 
LOOK WHAT I'VE GONE 
CHECK IT OUT 
FRESH FROM THE BINS THE EVENING'S 
HAUL IS SHOWN TO FELLOW MORAGER 
ROWLAND AT TIME OF RISING FOOD 
PRICES IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY 
POTATOES APPLES 
THANKS TO OUR POTATOES APPLES THROW AWAY CULTURE SOME PEOPLE CAN 
EAT ALL FOR FREE 
WELL THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE 
ENVIRONMENT FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS 
ISSUED A STATEMENT FROM THE 
ENVIRONMENT MINISTER TONIGHT 
I'M JOINED NOW BY COUNCILLOR PAUL 
BETTISON THE CHAIRMAN OF THE 
ENVIRONMENT BOARD OF THE LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION AND BY THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL TONY JUNIPER WE 
CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS CAN WE NO NO WE CAN'T WE NEED TO RECYCLE WEEST 
FOOD THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO 
IS ADDRESS THE PRODUCTION OF THAT 
WASTE IN THE FIRST PLACE IT'S 
BETTER NOT TO HAVE IT AS WASTE THAN 
TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT AT ALL ARE ARE YOU IN THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO WHAT EAT LESS 
BUY LESS OR WHAT EAT MORE PERHAPS 
WE'RE CERTAINLY ENCOURAGING PEOPLE 
NOT TO BUY FOOD THAT THEY DON'T 
WISH TO CONSUME 
WHAT IS THE 
BIGGEST PROBLEM YOU THINK 
WELL I 
DISAGREE WITH WHAT WE HEARD EARLIER 
AND I THINK ONE OF THE MAJOR 
CONTRIBUTORS TO WASTE FOOD IS THIS 
HABIT OF SELLING STUFF ON A BUY ONE 
GET ONE FREE BASIS CERTAINLY IN MY 
OWN AUTHORITY WE SEE A LOT OF FOOD 
IN THE BINS THAT HAS NEVER BEEN 
OPENED IT'S IN THE PACKS AND IT'S 
AS A RESULT OF BOGOFF 
I SEE THAT 
WOULD BE A START WOULDN'T IT IT IT WOULD AND I THINK THE SUPERMARKETS 
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WAY IN WHICH 
THEY ENCOURAGE US TO SHOP THE 
WEEKLY HABIT WE'RE USED TO HAS 
MEANT MORE FOOD SITS AROUND THE 
HOUSE AND ENDS UP IN THE BIN 
BECAUSE WE DON'T SHOP EVERY DAY AND 
PLAN AS CAREFULLY AS WE USED TO 
THERE'S A CULTURAL THING THERE 
WHICH IS LINKED TO SHOPPING THE 
IMPACT OF FOOD WASTE IS HUGE ON THE 
ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE OF THE HUGE 
ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT THAT COMES 
WITH PRODUCING FOOD EVERYTHING 
FROM THE FERTILISERS AND THE 
EMISSION THAT'S COME WITH THAT 
THROUGH TO THE TRANSPORT AND THE 
LAND USE AND MINIMISING FOOD WASTE 
HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 
THINGS WE CAN DO TO REDUCE OUR 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT WE WILL STILL 
HAVE WASTE FOOD AND OTHER ORGANIC 
WASTES THAT CAN BE PUT INTO THE 
ANAROBIC DIE JEGS PLANT 
HOW MANY 
OF THOSE PLANTS ARE THERE IN 
BRITAIN 
THERE'S A HANDFUL MANY BRITAIN MORE ARE IN THE CONTINENT THERE'S 
LOTS IN DENMARK THEY PRODUCE 
USEFUL POWER WE NEED MORE 
GOVERNMENT BACK TO HELP US REALISE 
THE BENEFITS OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES 
WOULD YOU LIKE LOTS OF THESE 
PLANTS 
I'D LIKE TO SEE A LOT MORE PLANTS THAN THERE ARE 
WHY DON'T YOU BUILD 
SOME THEN 
THEY'RE VERY EXPENSIVE 
TO BUILD LOCAL AUTHORITIES JUST 
DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO THAT 
THEMSELVES WE'VE ASKED GOVERNMENT 
FOR SUPPORT AND WE LOOK TO 
GOVERNMENT CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FOR 
SUPPORT ON THIS WE ARE OF COURSE 
STRUGGLING TO PAY THE EXCESSIVELY 
HIGH LANDFILL TAXES WE UNDERSTAND 
WHY THEY ARE HIGH 
IT'S TO 
DISCOURAGE YOU FROM PUTTING THINGS 
INTO THE GROUND 
YES THAT'S FINE 
WHAT IT'S DOING THIS IS A PERVERSE 
EFFECT IS IT'S PREVENTING LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES FROM INVESTING JUST AS 
WE WANT TOIN VEST WANT TO INVEST 
YOU WOULD LIKE TO BUILD THESE 
PLANTS TO DEAL WITH FOOD WASTE BUT 
YOU CAN'T BECAUSE YOU'RE SPENDING 
THE MONEY ON LANDFILL TAX YEAH YEAH INDEED THE RESIDENTS I REPRESENT 
WOULD BE PLEASE TODAY WE WERE ABLE 
TO COLLECT THEIR WASTE FOOD AND 
RECYCLE IT 
WHAT'S THE SOLUTION TO 
THAT 
THE ECONOMICS OF THE WASTE THAT MANAGEMENT PROCESS ARE CHANGING 
THE LANDFILL SIDE OF IT IS ONE 
THING BEAR IN MIND THAT THE COSTS 
OF THESE DIFFERENT WASTE DISPOSAL 
TREATMENTS ARE CHANGING F. WE 
STARTED TO SCALE UP AND GEAR UP TO 
ANAROBIC DIE JEGS TO BEING MORE 
NORMAL WE WOULD GET THE BENEFITS 
OF THAT INCINERATION IS MORE 
EXPENSIVE AS A DISPOSAL OPTION A 
LOT OF COSTS WITH ANAROBIC DIE JEGS 
IS LESS IF GOVERNMENT IS SERIOUS 
ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE WE NEED TO 
BUILD THE COST OF CARBON INTO 
POLICY CHOICES WE MAKE IN FUTURE 
THE COST OF METHANE IN THIS CASE 
GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE A LEAD IN 
TRANSFORMING THE ECONOMICS AND 
HELPING LOCAL AUTHORITIES GO THE 
RIGHT DIRECTION LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
CAN ALREADY DO A LOT WE HAVE 
GUIDANCE FROM GOVERNMENT ALREADY IN 
THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN ENGLAND WASTE STRATY THAT 
FAVOURS ANAROBIC DIJEGS HOLD YOUR 
HOLD YOUR HORSES FOR A SECOND WHAT ABOUT 
INCINERATION WHY ARE YOU SO 
PARTIAL TO BURNING EVERYTHING YEAR YEAR R. WE'RE NOT PARTIAL TO THAT WE 
WOULD LOVE TO RECYCLE MORE ON THE 
SUBJECT OF RECYCLING WE WOULD LIKE 
TO SEE THE LANDFILL TAX RECYCLED 
AND THAT MONEY COME BACK TO LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES TO BE INVESTED IN 
FURTHER RECYCLING METHODS BUT AND 
INDEED WHEN THE THEN CHANCELLOR 
NOW PRIME MINISTER ANNOUNCED THE 
LANDFILL TAX ESCALATOR HE SAID THAT 
THIS WAS NOT INTENDED AS A REF 
ENOUGH GENERATING EXERCISE HIS 
WORD IT WAS INTENDED INSTEAD AS A 
HABIT CHANGING EXERCISE WE'VE SEEN 
NO SIGN OF THAT MONEY COMING BACK 
INTO THE SYSTEM AS WAS INITIALLY 
PROMISED 
WHAT ONE THING WOULD YOU PROMISED LIKE TO SEE LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
DOING 
I THINK WE'D LIKE TO SEE DOING LOCAL AUTHORITIES LOBYING MORE 
VIGOROUSLY FOR THE KIND OF 
TECHNOLOGIES WE'VE SEEN IN THE 
PROGRAMME THIS EVENING AND TO SEE 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES SHOWING SOME 
LEADERSHIP IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE 
COUNTRY THERE'S VERY DIFFERENT 
LEVELS OF RECYCLING DEPENDING ON 
WHERE YOU LIVE GOOD PRACTICE IS 
ALREADY OUT THERE PERHAPS A LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT BODY SHOULD WORK 
TOGETHER TO CHAMPION THAT BEST 
PRACTICE AND DO IT ANY WAY EVEN IF 
GOVERNMENT ISN'T SHOWING THE 
LEADERSHIP IT COULD BUT TRYING TO 
GET GOVERNMENT TO DO MORE TO HELP 
EVERYBODY TO GO GREENER QUICKER IT 
CAN BE DONE IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE 
CONTINENT YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S 
POSSIBLE 
THANK YOU BOTH POSSIBLE LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ON OUR 
WEBSITE WE HOPE TO SPEAK TO THE 
MINISTER FOR RUBBISH ON TOMORROW'S 
PROGRAMME PROGRAMME THE BOSS OF SAINSBURY'S WILL BE 
TELLING US WHY SOME OF THE
