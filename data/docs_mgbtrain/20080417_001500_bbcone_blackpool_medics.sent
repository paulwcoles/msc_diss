LAST SUMMER THE B. B. C. WAS GRANTED EXCLUSIVE ACCESS 
TO THE REGION'S AMBULANCE CREWS AND TO BLACKPOOL VICTORIA HOSPITAL ONE OF THE BUSIEST IN THE COUNTRY 
SIX MONTHS LATER WE'RE BACK TO SEE HOW OUR BLACKPOOL MEDICS COPE WITH 
THE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES THAT WINTER BRINGS 
TONIGHT THE FIVE HOUR HEART OPERATION THAT MEANS LIFE OR DEATH FOR BILL ARMSTRONG 
FUNDAMENTALLY FOR YOU UNTREATED YOU'RE GOING TO DIE OF YOUR DISEASE 
ON THE FRONT LINE WITH BLACKPOOL'S ARMY OF MEDICS 
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE GOT SOME BLOOD GROUP CROSS MATCHED FOR YOU 
AND A MUM IS DESPERATE TO HAVE A NATURAL BIRTH BUT THE CLOCK IS AGAINST HER 
IN THE YEAR OF ITS SIXTIETH BIRTHDAY THIS IS THE N. H. S. THROUGH THE EYES OF THE MEDICS WHOSE JOB IT IS 
TO KEEP THE NATION HEALTHY AND TO SAVE L. I. V. E. S. TWENTY FOUR SLASH SEVEN 
BILL ARMSTRONG AND HIS PARTNER ALICE HAVE ENJOYED SOME OF THE HAPPIEST YEARS OF THEIR LIVES TOGETHER 
BUT LIFE HAS GROUND TO A HALT SINCE BILL WAS DIAGNOSED WITH MAJOR HEART PROBLEMS 
WE'VE WALKED FOR MANY YEARS PARTICULARLY IN THE YORKSHIRE DALES 
WHICH WE'VE FOUND ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL AND NOT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT 
IS QUITE A BURDEN QUITE A BURDEN REALLY 
HE'S ALL RIGHT IF HE DOES NOTHING BUT YOU 
CAN'T LIVE LIFE DOING NOTHING 
WE JUST WANT TO GET THE OPERATION FINISHED KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME IS 
AND THEN HOPEFULLY START TO RECOVER 
BECOME A NEW MAN 
BILL'S LIFE IS IN THE HANDS 
OF ONE OF BLACKPOOL VICTORIA'S MOST EXPERIENCED HEART SURGEONS 
RUSSELL MILNER 
HE'S GOT QUITE SIGNIFICANT CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE I. E. THE ARTERIES 
THAT SUPPLY BLOOD TO HIS HEART ARE BLOCKING UP 
SECONDLY HE'S WORN OUT HIS AORTIC VALVE 
WHICH IS THE MAIN VALVE WHICH COMES OUT OF THE HEART 
THROUGH WHICH ALL THE BLOOD THAT IS GOING TO GO ROUND THE BODY COMES OUT 
SO A COMPOUNDING VICIOUS CIRCLE OF PROBLEMS 
THE OPERATION CARRIES HUGE RISKS BUT BILL HAS RUN OUT OF OPTIONS 
THE LONG AND COMPLICATED PROCEDURE IS HIS ONLY HOPE 
YES IT'S A BIG OPERATION IT HAS BIG REWARDS IF IT GOES WELL 
BUT YES CLEARLY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT QUITE SERIOUS RISKS IF THINGS DON'T GO SMOOTHLY 
BY RISK I MEAN CHANCES OF DEATH OR STROKE ARE THE TWO THINGS I'D WARN YOU ABOUT IN PARTICULAR 
CONVERSELY WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES 
WELL FUNDAMENTALLY FOR YOU UNTREATED 
YOU'RE GOING TO DIE MOSTLY OF YOUR AORTIC VALVE DISEASE 
THE GAME PLAN HERE IS TO TRY AND GET YOU BACK TO A NORMAL LIFESTYLE FOR YOUR AGE 
AND HOPEFULLY MAKE YOU LIVE LONGER THANK YOU 
O. K. NOTHING ELSE YOU'RE HAPPY 
RIGHT I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW THANK YOU 
SEVENTY SIX YEARS YOUNGER THAN BILL THREE YEAR OLD SCOTT REEVES IS THE NEXT PATIENT 
IN NEED OF THE CARE AND ATTENTION OF THE BLACKPOOL MEDICS 
HE'S BEEN BROUGHT IN TO CASUALTY BY HIS MUM DONNA AFTER STICKING POLYSTYRENE BALLS IN HIS EARS 
THERE YOU GO LADY I WALKED IN HIS BEDROOM AND HE'S 
SWIMMING IN THE BEAN BAG BALLS AND YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW MANY IS THERE IN A BEAN BAG THIS BIG CAN'T YOU 
YOU KNOW THE WHOLE FLOOR IS COVERED 
HOW MANY DID YOU PUT IN EACH EAR 
TWO OF THEM TWO OF THEM O. K. KID 
SHE'S ALREADY TRIED TO RETRIEVE THEM AT HOME DIY STYLE 
I'VE HAD THE HOOVER ON IT AS WELL AND I'VE BEEN SUCKING HIS EARS TRYING TO GET IT OUT 
BUT NO NO JOY CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOUR 
CAN YOU HOLD ON MY BARNEY 
CASUALTY DOCTOR FRANK HASSAMI IS GOING TO TRY AND GET THEM OUT 
SO WE TRY FIRST WITH SUCTION IF IT WORKS HOPEFULLY IT WORKS 
CAN WE POP YOUR HEAD BACK SCOTT REST YOUR HEAD BACK I'M GOING TO HOLD IT 
KEEP REALLY STILL IT'S JUST GOING TO TICKLE IN YOUR EAR 
THAT IS STINGING ME AH LOOK AT THIS WOW 
BUT AFTER THE FIRST BALL IS RETRIEVED SCOTT DECIDES HE'S HAD ENOUGH 
I HATE THAT HOOVER IN THERE 
AGH AGH 
TO AVOID DISTRESSING HIM FURTHER THE TEAM ABANDON THE PROCEDURE 
SCOTT WILL NOW HAVE TO UNDERGO AN OPERATION UNDER GENERAL ANAESTHETIC 
COME ON SWEETIE PIE 
THE HOSPITAL'S A AND AMP E. DEPARTMENT DEALS WITH NEARLY TWO THOUSAND CASUALTIES EVERY WEEK 
THAT'S AROUND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS ANNUALLY 
THE DEPARTMENT IS THERE TWENTY FOUR SEVENTHS SERVING A POPULATION OF THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND 
AND UP TO SIXTEEN MILLION VISITORS TO THE AREA EVERY YEAR 
CLEVELEYS JUST FOUR MILES NORTH OF BLACKPOOL TOWER 
HERE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ARE BUILDING A NEW PROMENADE 
IT'S A DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT EVEN WITH THE RIGHT WORK BOOTS ON AS DAVID READ HAS LEARNED TO HIS COST 
WE WAS CARRYING A PIECE OF TIMBER 
IT FELL BASICALLY AND LANDED ON ME FOOT THAT WAS IT 
IT DIDN'T HURT AT FIRST BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE THE ADRENALINE TOOK OVER 
BUT THEN IT STARTED THROBBING AFTER ABOUT FOUR SECONDS 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING DOWN THERE STARTED THIS MORNING 
REALLY FIRST DAY ON THE JOB 
WHAT WE HAVE HERE ARE THE METATARSALS AND IF WE ZOOM IN 
THESE DAYS DIGITAL X. RAYS ARE TURNED ROUND IN SECONDS 
THERE'S NO LONG WAIT WHILE HARD COPIES ARE PROCESSED 
SO THAT'S CRACKED AND THEN THERE'S A VERY SMALL HAIRLINE CRACK ON THE SECOND METATARSAL AS WELL 
IT'S NOT JUST THAT YOUR FOOT IS SWOLLEN IT NEEDS TO BE IMMOBILISED BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO FRACTURES 
ALL THAT REMAINS FOR DAVID IS A TRIP TO THE PLASTER ROOM 
ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT AND HE'LL BE HOME IN TIME FOR LUNCH 
WHICH IS MORE THAN CAN BE SAID FOR THE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STAFF AND PATIENTS WHO'LL BE DINING HERE IN THE HOSPITAL 
FOUR THOUSAND MEALS A DAY ARE PREPARED IN THE HOSPITAL KITCHENS BEFORE BEING SHIPPED OUT BY TROLLEY TO THE WARDS 
I THINK THE KITCHEN IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE HOSPITAL 
I THINK WE GET OVERLOOKED TOO MUCH 
YOU'VE GOT SIX HUNDRED HUNGRY PATIENTS THAT WANT FOOD 
ER WHEN I WAS IN HOSPITAL AND I WAS ILL THE FIRST THING 
I LOOKED FOR WAS MY DINNER YOU KNOW THEN WHEN YOU'VE HAD YOUR DINNER YOU'RE WAITING FOR YOUR TEA 
SO IT'S LIKE THEY'RE THERE ANXIOUSLY WAITING FOR SOMETHING AND YOU'VE 
GO TO BE READY AND GET IT TO THEM ON TIME 
BILL ARMSTRONG IS ONE PATIENT WHO WON'T BE DINING AT THE HOSPITAL THIS LUNCHTIME 
HE'S ABOUT TO UNDERGO SEVERAL HOURS OF PAINSTAKING HEART SURGERY 
WHILE ONE TEAM REMOVES A VEIN FROM BILL'S LEG FOR HIS BY PASS OPERATION 
MR. MILNER OPENS HIS CHEST FOR SURGERY 
KNOWING BILL IS IN GOOD HANDS THERE'S NOTHING ALICE CAN DO BUT WAIT 
BILL'S HEART IS DELIBERATELY STOPPED 
THE HEART'S STOPPED 
IT STOPPED PRETTY MUCH IMMEDIATELY 
HE'S NOW BEING KEPT ALIVE BY A MACHINE 
MR. MILNER'S NEXT PRIORITY IS REMOVING BILL'S DISEASED AORTIC VALVE 
THE MOST MAJESTIC LUMP OF ROCK 
THAT'S PRETENDING TO BE AN AORTIC VALVE 
IT'S A PROMISING START BUT FOR PATIENT AND SURGEON THERE'S STILL A LONG WAY TO GO 
LITTLE SCOTT REEVES IS BACK FOR A MORE MINOR PROCEDURE 
THE POLYSTYRENE BALL HE STUFFED IN HIS EAR IS GOING TO BE REMOVED WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT HELLO 
YOU GO TO SLEEP GOOD NIGHT 
THIS TIME SCOTT'S HAVING A GENERAL ANAESTHETIC BUT HE'S NOT GOING WITHOUT A FIGHT 
DON'T LIKE THAT 
I HATE THAT AGH 
GOOD BOY THAT'S IT 
HAVE YOU GOT HIS HEAD YEAH I'VE GOT HIS HEAD 
JUST LIE HIM DOWN LOVE 
HE'S ABSOLUTELY FINE WANT TO GIVE HIM A KISS 
YEAH HE'S ABSOLUTELY FINE 
IT'S QUITE UPSETTING ISN'T IT AH 
TOTALLY WORRIED 
HE'LL BE FINE I KNOW HE WILL 
SCOTT'S IN SAFE HANDS 
SURGEON MR. AJAY NIGAM HAS RETRIEVED A HUGE VARIETY OF FOREIGN OBJECTS FROM THE EARS AND NOSES OF PATIENTS 
INCLUDING BATTERIES AND EVEN RING PULLS FROM DRINKS CANS 
BUT THIS JOB SHOULD BE A SIMPLE ONE 
THIS IS THE POLYSTYRENE BALL 
JOB DONE BUT NOT BEFORE A FINAL WORD OF CAUTION 
TO PARENTS TEMPTED TO TRY DIY SURGERY WITH THE HOUSEHOLD VACUUM CLEANER 
IT'S PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA TO PUT A DYSON IN YOUR EAR TO REMOVE A FOREIGN BODY 
WE DO HAVE A VERSION OF A DYSON IN THE HOSPITAL WHICH IS A VACUUM CLEANER 
WHAT I'VE JUST BEEN USING TO REMOVE THE WAX FROM THE EAR BUT OURS IS A BIT SAFER 
MUMMY'S HERE 
IN THE CARDIAC THEATRE BILL ARMSTRONG'S HEART OPERATION ENTERS A CRITICAL PHASE 
HIS NEW VALVE HAS BEEN PUT IN AND THE SURGICAL TEAM ARE ABOUT TO RE START HIS HEART 
SO HERE WE HAVE THE NEW VALVE IN PLACE 
THE HEART SHOULD NOW START TO PICK UP AND WORK ITSELF 
WITH THE STAKES SO HIGH IT'S NO SURPRISE WHEN TENSIONS BEGIN TO RISE 
NO GIVE ME IT BACK 
TURN THE SUCKER BACK ON JAMES 
TURN THE SUCKER BACK ON 
A MINOR COMPLICATION BUT IF MR. MILNER AND 
HIS TEAM HADN'T REACTED FAST IT COULD HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC 
THE BLOOD PRESSURE WENT DOWN AND THE RIGHT VENTRICLE DIDN'T BEHAVE VERY WELL 
NOT THE PROBLEM IT COULD HAVE BEEN BUT IT'S THE SORT OF THING WHERE IF YOU DON'T ACT RAPIDLY 
TEN MINUTES LATER YOU HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM 
AFTER MORE THAN FIVE HOURS MR. MILNER'S JOB IS DONE 
AND BILL IS TAKEN TO INTENSIVE CARE FOR OBSERVATION 
OH HE COULD STILL GET INTO AN AWFUL LOT OF PROBLEMS IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS 
I SAY TO PEOPLE MY ANALOGY IN THIS BUSINESS IT THAT GOOD NEWS COMES SLOWLY DISASTERS COME QUICKLY 
ERM AND A NICE SLOW STEADY UNEVENTFUL POSITIVE PROGRESS WOULD BE GREAT 
BILL 
BILL 
OH HE'S FAST ASLEEP 
WELL HE FEELS NICE AND WARM 
I'M GOING NOW SEE YOU TOMORROW 
NIGHT 
DRIVE IT ON COME ON FYLDE 
COME ON FYLDE 
FYLDE RUGBY CLUB SECRETARY MICHAEL HORNBY IS DUE TO UNDERGO SURGERY 
BECAUSE HE HAS CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER 
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO 
DRINK ALCOHOL AGAIN WITHOUT SEVERE DISRUPTION TO MY LIFE OR EVEN DEATH THROUGH LIVER DISEASE 
MICHAEL'S FUTURE WELLBEING IS IN THE HANDS OF THIS MAN BLACKPOOL VICTORIA'S DOCTOR CHRIS SHORROCK 
IN THREE DAYS' TIME HE'LL PERFORM A PROCEDURE WHICH WILL DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE MICHAEL'S QUALITY OF LIFE 
IN MICHAEL'S CASE THERE ARE SOME UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE 
WHOSE LIVER IS VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL SUCH THAT THEY CAN GET ALCOHOL DAMAGE WITH REALLY 
LEVELS OF ALCOHOL THAT YOU REALLY WOULDN'T ASSOCIATE WITH PERMANENT IRREVERSIBLE LIVER DAMAGE 
AND THESE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THEY'VE GOT THIS CONDITION 
COME ON FYLDE THAT'S GOOD PRESSURE 
AS A REGULAR DRINKER YOU DON'T THINK THAT OVER A PERIOD OF FORTY EIGHT HOURS IN A WEEKEND 
YOU CAN HAVE UP TO TWICE THE RECOMMENDED LIMIT FOR THAT WEEK 
I'VE NO CHOICE ANY MORE MY CHOICES HAVE RAN OUT BECAUSE OF MY CONSUMPTION 
MICHAEL WAS UNAWARE OF THE DAMAGE HE WAS DOING TO HIS LIVER BUT OVERALL 
ALCOHOL MISUSE COSTS THE N. H. S. NEARLY TWO BILLION EVERY YEAR 
IT'S BONFIRE NIGHT WEEKEND AND THE LAST WEEKEND OF BLACKPOOL'S WORLD FAMOUS ILLUMINATIONS 
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE TURNED OUT FOR THE OCCASION AND THOUSANDS MORE ARE ENJOYING BONFIRE PARTIES AT HOME 
BUT IT'S NOT FIREWORK INJURIES THAT THE MEDICS AT THE HOSPITAL ARE ANTICIPATING 
IT'S THE WEEKEND AND THAT USUALLY MEANS ONLY ONE THING 
UP TO THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF ALL A AND AMP E. ATTENDANCES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE ALCOHOL RELATED 
BUT BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND FIVE A M. THIS FIGURE DOUBLES TO SEVENTY PER CENT NATIONALLY 
AND BLACKPOOL IS NO EXCEPTION 
KEEP STILL FOR US WE'RE TRYING TO HELP YOU 
VICTIMS GET INTO FIGHTS OR HAVE ACCIDENTS WHEN THEIR JUDGEMENT IS IMPAIRED 
FOR OTHERS IT'S A CASE OF SIMPLY OVERDOING IT 
THE BAD NEWS FOR THE HEALTH SERVICE IS THAT BINGE DRINKING IS SHOWING NOSIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN 
AND VALUABLE RESOURCES ARE BEING DIVERTED 
THAT'S THE END OF A FRIDAY NIGHT PARTY 
LISTEN TO THE DOCTORS NOT YOUR FRIENDS 
PATIENT HAS BEEN DRINKING 
A AND AMP E. SISTER ELLIS SPEAKING CAN I HELP YOU 
CASUALTY SISTER SHARON ELLIS IS TOLD PARAMEDICS ARE BRINGING IN A PATIENT WITH LIFE THREATENING NECK INJURIES 
HE'S ALREADY LOST TWO PINTS OF BLOOD 
SO THIS HAPPENED YOU THINK ABOUT TWO HOURS AGO DID IT 
THE PATIENT CAN'T BE IDENTIFIED FOR LEGAL REASONS 
YOUR VEINS AT THE MOMENT AREN'T VERY GOOD 
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE AMOUNT OF BLOOD YOU'VE LOST ALL RIGHT 
WHAT THE DOCTOR MIGHT NEED TO DO IS GET USE 
ONE OF THE VEINS IN YOUR GROIN TO GET A SAMPLE OUT OF SO THAT WE NEED TO GET A TEST DONE 
ALL RIGHT JUST BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF BLOOD YOU'VE LOST WE NEED TO MAKE 
SURE WE'VE GOT SOME BLOOD GROUP CROSS MATCHED FOR YOU 
CAN YOU SWALLOW FOR ME 
HE COULD DEVELOP A SURGICAL EMPHYSEMA WHICH IS AIR IN THE TISSUES 
WHICH COULD THEN PUSH ON TO HIS WIND PIPE 
AND THAT BEING AS EXPOSED AS IT IS IT'S QUITE AT RISK SO HE'S GOT VERY LITTLE PROTECTION IT'S QUITE DEEP 
AT JUST AFTER THREE A M. DOCTOR FRANK HASSAMI WAKES THE ON CALL SURGEON AT HOME AND ASKS HIM TO COME IN URGENTLY 
MEANWHILE PARAMEDICS HAVE BEEN CALLED TO ANOTHER INCIDENT IN THE SHADOW OF BLACKPOOL TOWER 
WHAT'S HAPPENED MATE CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT'S HAPPENED 
TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENED TRY AND KEEP YOUR HEAD STILL BUT TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENED 
YOU REMEMBER THAT 
WILLIAM BREWER HAS JUMPED OVER A WALL 
AND FALLEN TEN F. T. OVER THE OTHER SIDE 
OPEN YOUR EYES FOR ME 
HOW MUCH ALCOHOL HAVE YOU HAD THIS EVENING 
SO IT'S JUST YOUR ARM THIS PAIN NOW IS IT IT'S JUST HERE MATE 
FROM THE SHOULDER DOWN ANY PAIN IN YOUR BACK 
IT'S COS IT'S NOVEMBER AND YOU'VE GOT A T. SHIRT ON 
BASICALLY HE'S GOT A HEAD INJURY SO WE'VE JUST DRESSED IT 
HE'S HAD NO LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND WE'LL TAKE HIM UP TO THE HOSPITAL FOR A CHECK UP 
AS WILLIAM IS DELIVERED TO HOSPITAL ON CALL SURGEON OMAR BUTT ARRIVES 
TO DEAL WITH THE PATIENT WITH SERIOUS NECK INJURIES 
I'M MR. BUTT I'M ONE OF THE DOCTORS HERE I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE A LOOK AT THIS 
YEAH WE'VE GOT TWO UNITS CROSS MATCHED 
THE ONLY THING THAT YOU WILL FEEL IS A SLIGHT NEEDLE PRICK IN THE NECK 
HE QUICKLY GETS DOWN TO WORK STITCHING UP THE WOUND 
IT'S A PAINSTAKING PROCEDURE 
THE INJURY IS ADJACENT TO THE WINDPIPE AND SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT VEINS IN THE HUMAN BODY 
SISTER SHARON ELLIS IS BACK ON TRIAGE ASSESSING PATIENTS AS THEY ARRIVE IN A AND AMP E. 
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE CUT AND A GRAZE I THINK 
AND A BIG EGG 
SHE'S DISCOVERED THAT WILLIAM'S INJURY IS FAR LESS SERIOUS 
YOU CAN'T TAKE MY RANGERS TOP AWAY 
OH NO I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT AWAY DON'T WORRY I'LL LEAVE IT WITH YOU 
I'M A GLASGOW RANGERS SUPPORTER TILL THE DAY I DIE 
I WOULDN'T STEAL THAT FROM YOU DON'T YOU WORRY 
THE SMALL SPLIT IN HIS HEAD SIMPLY NEEDS GLUING BACK TOGETHER 
STAY STILL FOR ME JUST WHILE I GLUE THIS 
IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM SURGEON OMAR BUTT IS ALMOST FINISHED WITH HIS PATIENT 
HE'S LUCKY TO BE ALIVE 
WE COULD SEE THE VOICE BOX THE LARYNX THERE 
SO A COUPLE OF MILLIMETRES DEEPER AND WE WOULD HAVE BEEN INTO THE AIRWAY 
AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED THERE 
AND A COUPLE OF MILLIMETRES ON THE SIDE AND WE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE REGION OF THE CAROTIDS SO AGAIN 
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ERM THEY WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT TO THE HOSPITAL THEN 
BY DAY THE PROCEDURES CARRIED OUT BY MEDICS AT BLACKPOOL VICTORIA 
TAKE ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT COMPLEXION 
A LOT OF THE WORK REVOLVES AROUND SCHEDULED OPERATIONS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OF THEM EVERY YEAR 
TODAY IS ANNE MARIE KNIGHT'S TURN 
SHE'S ARRIVED IN HOSPITAL FOR HER PRE OP CHECKS 
SHE DISCOVERED A LUMP UNDER HER CHIN AND TESTS HAVE REVEALED THE GROWTH IS CANCEROUS 
IT WAS SCARY REALLY SCARY 
YOU HAVE ALL THESE THOUGHTS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND DON'T YOU 
LIKE MY DAUGHTER'S GETTING MARRIED NEXT YEAR AND YOU THINK 
OH MY GOD AM I GONNA BE HERE SORT OF THING 
ANY CHANGE IN SIZE SINCE I LAST SAW YOU 
NO I DON'T THINK SO 
I'VE GOT FOUR CHILDREN AND THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING YET 
THEY OBVIOUSLY KNOW I'M IN HOSPITAL TODAY AND I'M HAVING THIS LUMP REMOVED 
BUT I HAVEN'T TOLD THEM IT'S CANCEROUS 
O. K. SO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO TODAY YES 
GONNA HAVE A GENERAL ANAESTHETIC 
SURGEON MR. NIGAM IS GOING TO TAKE THE TUMOUR OUT 
THE INTERESTING THING IS THE DIAGNOSIS 
IT'S A VERY RARE CONDITION 
INITIALLY WHEN WE SEE SOMEBODY WITH A LUMP IN THEIR NECK WE PUT A NEEDLE IN IT TO TAKE A SAMPLE 
AND WE COULDN'T GET AN ANSWER 
THEY SAID IT'S SOMETHING NASTY BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT 
SO BY REMOVING THIS ONE HOPEFULLY WE CURE IT AND SECONDLY WE MAKE AN ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS 
THE LAST TIME ANNE MARIE WAS IN BLACKPOOL VICTORIA HOSPITAL 
WAS TO GIVE BIRTH TO HER SON JONATHAN IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE 
TODAY ON THE DELIVERY SUITE JULIE CAVANAGH IS SIX HOURS INTO LABOUR 
JULIE'S FIRST CHILD BETHANY WAS BORN BY CAESAREAN SECTION SIX YEARS AGO 
BUT THIS TIME JULIE WANTS A NATURAL BIRTH HOWEVER THAT'S STILL NOT A CERTAINTY 
TAKING HUGE GULPS OF GAS AND AIR HELPS HER TO COPE WITH THE CONTRACTIONS 
BUT LIKE MANY MUMS TO BE JULIE IS HAVING PAIN RELIEF IN THE FORM OF AN EPIDURAL 
WHICH IS AN INJECTION OF DRUGS NEAR THE SPINAL CORD 
IT'S A DISTRESSING PROCEDURE FOR ALL CONCERNED 
SO HER MUM JOANNE LEAVES THE ROOM AS IT'S ADMINISTERED 
SHE JUST WANTS IT TO BE OVER NOW 
BUT NOW THE EPIDURAL IS FINALLY GOING IN 
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE FEELING A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE IN ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AND THEN SHE CAN REST 
I'VE NOW GOT AN EPIDURAL IN 
BUT I FEEL AN AWFUL LOT BETTER NOW I FEEL VERY SLEEPY AND WOBBLY LEGS 
THIS LONG HAUL THING IS NOT FUN 
SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS ARE TREATED AT BLACKPOOL VICTORIA EVERY YEAR AND THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED OPERATIONS A WEEK 
MICHAEL HORNBY HAS ARRIVED FOR HIS 
HE HAS CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER WHICH HAS CAUSED VEINS IN HIS OESOPHAGUS TO BLEED MAKING HIM ANAEMIC 
DOCTOR CHRIS SHORROCK IS GOING TO STOP THE BLOOD LOSS BY TYING 
OFF THE VEINS WITH ELASTIC BANDS USING A DEVICE CALLED AN ENDOSCOPE 
WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO IS I'LL SHOW YOU WITH THIS RUBBER GLOVE 
YOU CAN USE THE SUCTION AND YOU SUCK THE END OF THE RUBBER GLOVE 
UP INTO THE SCOPE LIKE SO AND I'LL TURN THIS HERE YOU'LL WATCH THE END OF THAT 
THAT BAND FIRES ONTO IT LIKE SO AND THAT'S THE VEIN CLOTTED OFF 
THE TIME FOR MICHAEL'S OPERATION HAS FINALLY COME 
FIRST HE HAS THE UNPLEASANT TASK OF SWALLOWING THE ENDOSCOPE 
ALL RIGHT MICHAEL GOOD SWALLOW WHEN YOU GET THIS TO THE BACK OF YOUR THROAT 
A BIT DIFFICULT TO GET DOWN THIS THAT'S IT YOU'VE DONE IT WELL DONE 
O. K. THERE WE GO THERE WE ARE 
ALL FINISHED 
MICHAEL'S REALLY GOT QUITE A BADLY SCARRED LIVER WHICH IN THE FUTURE IS LIKELY 
WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS TO BE CONSIDERED FOR LIVER TRANSPLANTATION 
BUT WITH SOMETHING LIKE WHERE ALCOHOL IS A COMPLICATING FACTOR YOU HAVE TO 
OBVIOUSLY MAKE SURE THAT THE PATIENTS DO NOT CONTINUE TO DRINK 
THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO MAKE SURE I DON'T ENTER INTO THE GEORGE BEST SCENARIO WHEREBY YOU REPLACE 
A DEFUNCT AND DAMAGED LIVER WITH ONE THAT'S BRAND NEW AND THEN START OFF AGAIN THINKING WELL 
IT'S JUST LIKE TAKING A TABLET I'M OVER THAT AND I'LL GO BACK TO MY OLD LIFESTYLE 
MICHAEL IS ON HIS WAY HOME AND NOW ANNE MARIE KNIGHT IS BEING PREPARED FOR SURGERY 
SURGEON MR. NIGAM IS REMOVING A CANCEROUS TUMOUR FROM HER NECK 
HE HAS TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO DAMAGE NERVES OR HE COULD PARALYSE HER TONGUE AND FACE 
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH THIS 
BECAUSE IT'S SO UNUSUAL YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT 
WE DON'T STILL KNOW WHAT KIND OF CANCER IT IS 
I THINK WE'RE NEARING THE END 
THAT'S THE LUMP SO THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS SITTING THERE 
IT WAS GOING IN THAT DEEP FROM THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN 
IT'S A VERY FAIRLY DEEP LESION 
AND THIS WILL BE SENT FOR EXAMINATION TO THE LAB 
ONLY WHEN THE TUMOUR HAS BEEN ANALYSED WILL ANNE MARIE KNOW HOW SERIOUS HER CONDITION IS 
THE OPERATION'S ALL FINISHED 
AS DAY TURNS TO NIGHT HUNDREDS OF HOSPITAL STAFF GO HOME FOR THE EVENING 
BUT IN THE DELIVERY SUITE THE WORK NEVER STOPS 
JULIE CAVANAGH HAS NOW BEEN IN HOSPITAL FOR EIGHTEEN HOURS 
IT'S BEEN A VERY VERY VERY LONG DAY 
FOR ME 
I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE OVER NOW PLEASE 
SOMETIMES YOU WONDER HOW SOMETHING SO NORMAL CAN HURT SO MUCH 
BUT THERE'S GOOD NEWS MIDWIFE LISA MURPHY IS NOW CONVINCED 
THAT JULIE WILL BE ABLE TO AVOID A CAESAREAN SECTION AND HAVE THE NATURAL BIRTH SHE HAS LONGED FOR 
EPIDURAL'S WORKING SHE'S GOT 
ERM A SYNTHETIC HORMONE GOING AT THE MOMENT 
BECAUSE HER CONTRACTIONS WEREN'T AS REGULAR AS WE WANTED THEM TO BE 
SO ERM WE'RE HOPING TO GET THESE MORE REGULAR AND 
THEN SHE'LL HAVE A BABY 
KEEP GOING KEEP GOING CLEVER GIRL 
THREE HOURS LATER AND JULIE IS JUST MOMENTS AWAY FROM HAVING HER BABY 
GO ON JULIE BABY'S NEARLY HERE JULIE 
THERE YOU GO HAVE A LOOK 
GRAB HER IF YOU WANT THERE YOU GO 
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL 
HAVE YOU GOT A NAME A FOR HER EMILY OH THAT'S NICE EMILY 
THE START OF A BRAND NEW LIFE AND THE BEGINNING OF ANOTHER DAY AT BLACKPOOL VICTORIA HOSPITAL 
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT DRAMAS WILL UNFOLD BUT WHAT IS CERTAIN IS 
THAT THE DEDICATED TEAMS OF MEDICS WILL BE THERE TO PLAY THEIR PART 
BILL ARMSTRONG IS NOW HOME AND GETTING STRONGER EVERY DAY 
HE'S NOT BEEN WALKING IN THE YORKSHIRE DALES WITH ALICE YET 
BUT THEY'RE HOPING TO GET THERE THIS SUMMER 
COME ON IN YOU GO FYLDE 
MICHAEL HORNBY IS STILL SHOUTING FOR HIS BELOVED FYLDE RUGBY CLUB 
HE'S NOW TEETOTAL AND COULD QUALIFY FOR A LIVER TRANSPLANT WITHIN IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS 
ANNE MARIE'S TUMOUR TURNED OUT TO BE A RARE FORM OF CANCER 
BUT WITH A COURSE OF RADIOTHERAPY SHE SHOULD MAKE A FULL RECOVERY 
SHE'S NOW PLANNING FOR HER DAUGHTER'S WEDDING 
I'VE GOT LOTS OF JOBS I'VE GOT TO GO AND SORT OUT A WEDDING CAKE THIS WEEK 
LITTLE SCOTT REEVES HAS AVOIDED ANY MORE TRIPS TO A AND AMP E. SINCE HE STUFFED POLYSTYRENE BALLS IN HIS EARS 
AND JULIE CAVANAGH IS HOME WITH BABY EMILY AND HER NEW BIG SISTER BETHANY 
YOU'VE BEEN THE ONE TO BEAT
