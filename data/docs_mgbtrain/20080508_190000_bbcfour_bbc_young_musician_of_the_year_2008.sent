THE B. B. C. YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR COMPETITION IS THE MOST 
ESTABLISHED AND PRESTIGIOUS CONTEST FOR YOUNG CLASSICAL PERFORMERS 
IN THE U. K. TODAY THE COMPETITION IS DIVIDED INTO FIVE CATEGORIES 
STRING WOODWIND 
BRASS PERCUSSION AND KEYBOARD 
THE COMPETITORS HAVE TO PERFORM IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE AND A PANEL OF JUDGES 
WITH THE POWER TO TRANSFORM THEIR LIVES FOREVER 
AT THIS STAGE WE'RE LOOKING FOR ONE FINALIST 
WHO'LL STAND UP WITH THE B. B. C. NATIONAL ORCHESTRA OF WALES IN THE MILLENNIUM CENTRE 
IN FRONT OF A HUGE AUDIENCE AND A T. V. AUDIENCE AND THEY NEED TO REALLY CAPTIVATE 
AND THEY NEED TO SELL THE PIECE THEY'RE PLAYING SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR THAT SPARK 
LAST NIGHT TWELVE YEAR OLD TROMBONIST PETER MOORE WAS PICKED 
TO REPRESENT THE BRASS CATEGORY 
HE JOINS GUITARIST JADRAN DUNCUMB FROM THE STRING CATEGORY 
AND WOODWIND WINNER FLAUTIST DAVID SMITH 
TONIGHT FOUR PERCUSSIONISTS WILL BATTLE IT OUT FOR A PLACE IN THIS SUNDAY'S GRAND FINAL 
I'M REALLY HAPPY TO GET TO THE CATEGORY FINAL THREE OTHER GREAT PERCUSSIONISTS 
I'M REALLY PROUD TO GET THIS FAR BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD 
AND MY PLAYING'S GOT BETTER COS OF THE WORK I PUT IN 
I SAID TO MY MUM I REALLY DOUBT I'M GOING TO GET THROUGH 
AND I THINK I'VE SAID THAT FOR EACH ROUND UP UNTIL NOW 
IT PROBABLY STILL HASN'T HIT ME AND STILL WON'T HIT ME FOR A FEW YEARS HOW BIG THIS IS REALLY 
THE WINNER OF THE PERCUSSION CATEGORY WILL GO TO THE GRAND FINAL WITH THE OTHER WINNERS 
ALL FIVE HOPING TO BE CROWNED B. B. C. YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
THE PERCUSSION SEMIFINALS HAPPENED LAST DECEMBER 
WHEN A PANEL OF JUDGES HAD TO CHOOSE JUST FOUR MUSICIANS TO GO THROUGH TO THE NEXT ROUND 
THE PERCUSSION CATEGORY FINALISTS ARE 
JIM MOLYNEUX 
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD JIM MOLYNEUX IS FROM LITTLEBOROUGH IN LANCASHIRE 
ANYONE WHO DIVES STRAIGHT IN TO THE DEEP END OF A SEVEN QUARTERS SORT OF FEEL YOU KNOW 
HAS GOT TO BE SOMETHING HE HANDLED THAT THE BOOGIE WOOGIE FEEL WAS PERFECT 
WHEN YOU'VE ONLY GOT FIFTEEN MINUTES A TO SHOW WHAT YOU CAN DO 
BUT B. TO SHOW WHAT THE INSTRUMENTS CAN DO AS WELL 
YOU'VE REALLY GOT TO PICK YOUR PROGRAMME EXTREMELY CAREFULLY 
AND I THOUGHT HE DID THAT REALLY WELL 
DELIA STEVENS 
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD DELIA STEVENS FROM LOUGHBOROUGH 
IS NOW THE ONLY GIRL LEFT IN THE WHOLE COMPETITION 
I REALLY LIKED DELIA'S PERFORMANCE UM 
I THOUGHT HER MARIMBA PLAYING HAD SOME REALLY NICE FLUID MOTION 
PARTICULARLY I LIKED WHERE THE MUSIC NEEDED TO BREATHE 
AND NEEDED TO SLOW DOWN AND JUST CHILL OUT 
SHE WASN'T AFRAID TO JUST TAKE HER TIME AND BACK OFF IT A LITTLE BIT 
DANIEL DAY 
DAN DAY ANOTHER SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD COMES FROM HAYFIELD IN DERBYSHIRE 
DANIEL A REALLY LYRICAL AND VERY GENTLE AND FOCUSED MUSICIAN 
I MEAN HE REALLY PULLED THE AUDIENCE IN YOU KNOW 
GOOD CONTROL AS WELL THERE WAS NO EDGINESS OR NERVOUSNESS ABOUT IT 
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY JUST JUST THERE 
FINALLY DAVID ELLIOT 
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD DAVE ELLIOT FROM BOURNEMOUTH IS THE OLDEST OF OUR FOUR FINALISTS 
I THINK HE WAS THE BEST TONIGHT FOR ME HE WAS THE BEST TONIGHT 
HE WAS THE OLDEST ALSO BUT HIS COMMAND OF THE MARIMBA WAS JUST REALLY GOOD 
HE BLEW ME AWAY MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE I'VE GOT TO SAY 
COMPLETELY AT ONE WITH THE INSTRUMENT FANTASTIC ALL ROUND TECHNIQUE 
I MEAN TECHNICALLY HE'S THE SOUNDEST PLAYER I THINK 
OUR FOUR WINNERS HAVE NOW GOT JUST TWO MONTHS 
TO PREPARE FOR THE PERCUSSION FINAL 
WE'RE ALL FRIENDS YOU KNOW 
I THINK IT'S REALLY NICE THE PERCUSSION 
YOU KNOW CATEGORY FINALS 
SUBLIMINALLY THERE IS A BIT OF COMPETITION IN THE BACK OF MY MIND YEAH 
EVERYONE WANTS TO DO WELL BUT UM 
I'M GREAT FRIENDS WITH DAN AND DAVE 
AND I'VE GOT TO KNOW DELIA THE PAST FEW WEEKS AS WELL 
SO WE ALL GET ON REALLY WELL SO I THINK 
AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW YOU CAN 
IF IF THE OTHERS 
YOU KNOW IF THE OTHERS WIN IT YOU CAN'T REALLY COMPLAIN 
BECAUSE YOU'RE HAPPY FOR THEM 
I'M QUITE A COMPETITIVE PERSON 
BUT I TRY TO HOLD THAT BACK BECAUSE I THINK 
THAT JUST MAKES THE ATMOSPHERE LIKE 
IT'S NOT VERY NICE IF EVERYONE'S TRYING TO PUT EACH OTHER DOWN 
SO I DON'T THINK OF IT AS A COMPETITION BUT AS A PERFORMANCE OPPORTUNITY 
I THINK THE ONLY HARD TIME WILL BE WHEN THE RESULTS 
YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO THAT 
IT'LL PROBABLY BE THE ONLY DIFFICULT TIME BUT 
I THINK EVEN YOU KNOW STRAIGHT AFTER IT AND 
BEFORE WHEN WE'RE PLAYING AND STUFF WE'LL BE FINE JUST 
PROBABLY KEEPING EACH OTHER RELAXED REALLY AND 
FRIENDLY BANTER 
DAN AND JIM ARE BOTH IN SIXTH FORM 
AT CHETHAM'S SCHOOL OF MUSIC IN THE HEART OF MANCHESTER 
IT'S BRITAIN'S LARGEST MUSIC SCHOOL WITH NEARLY THREE HUNDRED PUPILS STUDYING THERE 
IT HAS A GREAT RECORD IN THE B. B. C. YOUNG MUSICIAN COMPETITION 
PROVIDING MANY FINALISTS OVER THE YEARS 
SINCE BEING AT THE SCHOOL DAN AND JIM HAVE BECOME GOOD FRIENDS 
IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE MUSIC IS A COMMON PASSION 
AT MY OLD HIGH SCHOOL ANYONE WHO PLAYED AN INSTRUMENT WAS ALWAYS A BAND GEEK 
IT WASN'T AN OFFENSIVE TERM IT WAS JUST 
ACCEPTED THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE IF YOU PLAY AN INSTRUMENT 
WHEREAS HERE IT'S IT JUST SORT OF 
THE MORE INTO MUSIC YOU ARE AND HOW YOU PLAY IT 
AND WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU PERFORM I THINK 
THE BETTER YOU COME ACROSS REALLY 
CHET'S IS REALLY FUN TO STUDY AT 
UM YOU'RE DOING WELL IN SIXTH FORM I'M DOING EVERYTHING I REALLY WANNA DO 
SO THAT'S GEOGRAPHY MUSIC TECH AND MUSIC SO IT'S REALLY ENJOYABLE 
NOT HAVING TO DO STUFF LIKE MATHS 
THIS YEAR ANYWAY 
I'D SAY FOR SIXTH FORM IT'S VERY LAID BACK 
UM JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS LIKE YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT A LOT OF FREE TIME 
LIKE TODAY I'VE GOT ONE ACADEMIC LESSON SO IT'S VERY FREE FOR ME 
IT'S NOT AS CUSHY AS IT SOUNDS THOUGH 
AS THIS SCHEDULE IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW THEM TIME FOR THEIR MUSIC 
THE SCHOOL TIMETABLE IS GEARED AROUND THEIR MUSICAL LIFE 
SO ALL THEIR ENSEMBLES AND LESSON TIMES FIT IN 
AROUND THEIR CURRICULUM SO IT'S 
IN FACT PROBABLY THEY'RE EXPOSED TO EVERYTHING AND IT'S SORT OF 
ALL HERE AND AVAILABLE UNDER ONE ROOF 
I THINK IT'S A GOOD ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS IN THAT WAY 
FROM THE THREE QUARTERS START AND JUST GO THOSE THREE CELLS THAT YOU STARTED O. K. 
PAUL PATRICK WHO'S ALSO THE PRINCIPAL PERCUSSIONIST IN THE B. B. C. PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA 
WILL BE HELPING DAN AND JIM PREPARE FOR THE COMPETITION 
BOTH DAN DAY AND JIM MOLYNEUX ARE VERY KEEN COMPOSERS THEMSELVES 
AND I'VE DONE A LOT TO TRY AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO EXPLORE THIS COMPOSITIONAL SKILL 
AND INCLUDE THIS IN THEIR PIECES FOR THE PROGRAMME SO 
THEY BOTH HAVE SIMILARITIES THEY'RE INTO ALL SORTS OF MUSIC 
BOTH JAZZ ROCK FOLK MUSIC VERY INTO FOLK MUSIC 
FOUR S. Q. U. A R. E. IS A BAND DAN AND JIM HAVE FORMED WITH A COUPLE OF FRIENDS 
FROM OUTSIDE SCHOOL 
THEIR MUSICAL STYLE IS HARD TO DEFINE 
WE CALL OURSELVES FOLK FUSION I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE'S ANY OTHER BANDS WITH THAT TITLE 
BUT WE TAKE FOLK TUNES AND LIKE FUNK THEM UP AND STUFF 
IN THE SUMMER WE'VE GOT QUITE A LOT OF BRITISH FOLK FESTIVALS THIS YEAR 
AND QUITE A BIG PROGRAMME OF FESTIVALS' 
WE'RE RECORDING AN ALBUM AT THE MOMENT AS WELL 
WE'RE GONNA GO FROM THE BEGINNING AGAIN 
FOUR S. Q. U. A R. E. ARE PRODUCING THE ALBUM THEMSELVES HERE 
BUT ME AND JIM HAVING LESSONS IN MUSIC TECH 
ARE THE ONES WHO KIND OF ENGINEER IT 
AND NICO AND JAMES KIND OF SIT AND WATCH 
I'D NEVER REALLY DONE ANY COMPOSITION BEFORE CHET'S 
I STARTED IT IN MY FIRST YEAR REALLY STARTED COMPOSING LITTLE PIECES 
IF YOU'RE PLAYING OTHER PEOPLE'S PIECES IT'S HARD TO 
BRING ACROSS WHAT THE COMPOSER WANTED 
WHEREAS IF YOU'RE FROM THE COMPOSER'S POINT OF VIEW 
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT TO PLAY AND HOW TO PLAY IT 
PLUS YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEARN IT AFTER YOU'VE WRITTEN IT 
SO IT'S QUITE HANDY 
IN THE WOODWIND SEMI FINALS 
FLUTIST LIZ LAWTON PLAYED ONE OF JIM'S PIECES 
I WROTE HER A PIECE WHICH SHE PLAYED 
APPARENTLY IT WENT DOWN QUITE WELL I WAS PLEASED WITH THAT 
SO IT'S REALLY NICE TO HAVE OTHER PEOPLE PLAY YOUR MUSIC 
THIS IS A SONG I WROTE ON THE FIRST DAY OF THIS YEAR AT HOME 
AND IT'S CALLED I'M HOME 
AND I DID IT SOLELY TO 
I WANTED TO RECORD 
ONE OF MY SONGS HERE SO I PUT DOWN THE PIANO TRACK FIRST 
AND THEN OVERDUBBED EVERYTHING ELSE OVER THE TOP 
AND THAT'S THE BASS DRUM KIT VOCALS TWO BACKING VOCALS 
SO I'M JUST EXPERIMENTING REALLY WITH MY OWN SONGS' 
OUR THIRD PERCUSSION FINALIST ALSO USED TO BE AT CHETHAM'S 
MYSELF JIM AND DAN HAVE BEEN GOING TO CHET'S FOR 
I WAS THERE FOR THREE YEARS THEY WERE THERE 
BASICALLY YOU KNOW WE GREW UP TOGETHER 
AND THE WAY I SEE IT IS THEY'RE GREAT MATES OF MINE 
I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE IN THE COMPETITION WITH THEM 
DAVE HAS NOW LEFT HIS MATES IN CHETHAM'S 
AND MOVED TO COLLEGE IN LONDON 
CHETHAM'S WAS A REALLY GOOD PLACE FOR ME TO LEARN PERCUSSION 
IT COVERED EVERY ASPECT OF PERCUSSION PLAYING 
FROM SOLO PERCUSSION TUNED PERCUSSION TIMPANI ORCHESTRAL 
BIG BAND PLAYING JAZZ ENSEMBLE 
I CHOSE TO COME HERE TO LONDON TO SEE WHAT LONDON WAS LIKE 
AND I WANTED TO DELVE INTO THE JAZZ ASPECT OF PERCUSSION PLAYING 
AND TRINITY IS A FANTASTIC JAZZ COURSE 
DAVE'S BEEN A PERCUSSION FINALIST IN THE COMPETITION BEFORE 
AND HOPES HIS PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WILL HELP HIM THIS TIME AROUND 
WHEN I DID B. B. C. YOUNG MUSICIAN TWO THOUSAND SIX IT GAVE ME 
QUITE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN WHAT TO EXPECT FOR THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT COMPETITION 
OBVIOUSLY A COMPETITION'S ALWAYS GONNA BE A BIT NERVE WRACKING 
I WOULD SAY THAT THIS TIME I FEEL A LOT MORE AT EASE 
SINCE COMPETING IN TWO THOUSAND SIX 
DAVE HAS STARTED ON HIS JAZZ COURSE AT TRINITY COLLEGE 
HE HOPES THAT A BROADER RANGE OF MUSICAL STYLES 
MIGHT GIVE HIM AN EDGE IN THIS YEAR'S COMPETITION 
THE REASON WHY I'VE CHOSEN 
A JAZZ PIECE TO PLAY IS TO DISPLAY THE OTHER SIDE OF MY PLAYING 
AS A MUSICIAN I MEAN 
ALL VERY PREDOMINANTLY THIS COMPETITION IS CLASSICAL 
I FEEL THAT 
IT'S A GOOD CHANCE TO DISPLAY YOURSELF AS AN OVERALL PERFORMER 
HOPEFULLY IT WILL MAKE ME KIND OF 
STICK OUT FROM THE REST OF THE OTHER GUYS' 
TWO OF DAVE'S FELLOW BAND MEMBERS WILL BE ACCOMPANYING HIM IN THE CATEGORY FINALS 
COS I KNOW I'VE PLAYED WITH THEM QUITE A FEW TIMES ON DRUMS 
IN A WAY I. I HAVE TO DO IT GET IT RIGHT FOR THEM IF YOU LIKE 
IN A WAY COS I KNOW THEY'RE NOT GONNA MESS IT UP 
I CAN TRUST THEM A LOT AND THEY'RE GREAT PLAYERS' 
FOR THIS YEAR I FEEL 
A LOT OF THE PIECES I'M DOING THERE'S A LOT MORE PERSONAL 
THEY'RE MY ARRANGEMENTS YOU KNOW EVEN SOMETIMES MY COMPOSITIONS 
IN THE COMPETITION ALL THE PERCUSSIONISTS PLAY AN UNTUNED OR DRUM PIECE 
AND A PIECE ON A PITCHED INSTRUMENT 
TECHNICALLY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLAYING UN PITCHED PERCUSSION 
MAINLY BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT FOUR STICKS IN YOUR HAND FOR TUNES 
WHEREAS DRUMS YOU USUALLY HAVE JUST TWO 
IN THE FINAL DAVE HAS CHOSEN TO PLAY A DRUM PIECE 
ONE ON THE MARIMBA AND HIS OWN ARRANGEMENT OF A JAZZ STANDARD ON VIBRAPHONE 
I MEAN I REALLY ENJOY YOU KNOW ARRANGING PIECES AND THINGS 
SO THAT THEY BECOME MY TAKE ON IT 
IN THIS COMPETITION YOU HAVE TO TRY AND YOU KNOW STAND OUT FROM THE REST ESSENTIALLY 
WELL I LIVE IN A VILLAGE AND I LIVE DOWN A LANE 
AND WE HAVEN'T GOT VERY MANY NEIGHBOURS CLOSE TO US 
WHICH IS QUITE GOOD BECAUSE AS I PLAY PERCUSSION 
I'D ANNOY THE NEIGHBOURS IF I WANTED TO PLAY EARLY IN THE MORNING 
DELIA IS A PUPIL AT LOUGHBOROUGH HIGH SCHOOL IN LEICESTERSHIRE 
SHE KNEW SHE WANTED TO PLAY PERCUSSION FROM AN EARLY AGE 
I WAS INSPIRED TO PLAY PERCUSSION WHEN I WATCHED A SCHOOL CONCERT 
AND A BOY WAS PLAYING THE SUSPENDED CYMBAL 
I WENT HOME AND TRIED TO DRAW A CYMBAL TO MY MUM 
BUT I WAS ONLY EIGHT MY DRAWING SKILLS WEREN'T GREAT 
WHEN DELIA STARTED PLAYING PERCUSSION 
SHE HAD ONLY A LITTLE PRACTICE PART 
AFTER A FEW MONTHS FOR TRYING OUT THE TEACHER TOLD ME TO BUY A DRUM KIT 
I HAD NOT A CLUE ABOUT THAT 
I EVEN HAD TO LOOK UP WHAT IS PERCUSSION 
BECAUSE ME BEING GERMAN DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THAT WORD IN MY VOCABULARY 
HER MUM MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN WHAT PERCUSSION MEANT 
BUT DELIA CERTAINLY DID 
IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE SHE SET HER SIGHTS HIGHER 
WHEN DELIA CAME UP WITH THE IDEA TO START MUSIC SCHOOL 
I WAS A BIT WORRIED BECAUSE IT'S A HUGE COMMITMENT 
IT'S NOT ONLY ANOTHER SCHOOL DAY WHICH IS ADDED ON TO HER TIMETABLE 
IT'S ALSO THAT LONG JOURNEY FOR HER 
I DID NOT WANT HER TO DROP SCHOOL MARKS IN EXCHANGE FOR MUSIC SKILLS 
AND I SAID I'M WATCHING YOUR MARKS 
IF THEY GO DOWN BECAUSE OF ALL THAT EXTRA WORK YOU HAVE TO DO 
WE WILL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN 
DELIA'S MARKS EVEN WENT UP AND STAYED EVER SINCE AS TOP MARKS 
I DECIDED TO ENTER B. B. C. YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR 
BECAUSE MY TEACHER SUGGESTED IT I DIDN'T THINK I'D BE GOOD ENOUGH 
BUT I WAS LIKE IT DOESN'T MATTER IT'S GOOD EXPERIENCE 
ALTHOUGH I HAVE PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON MYSELF 
BECAUSE I'M A BIT OF A PERFECTIONIST WHEN IT COMES TO MUSIC 
MY DAD WAS I'D SAY FROM A YOUNG AGE MY MAIN INSPIRATION REALLY 
FROM THE START 
BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONE WHO YOU KNOW SET ME OFF GOING 
AND HE'D GIVE ME LOADS OF MUSIC 
AND I'D JUST SIT IN MY ROOM AND JUST PUT THEM ON AND THEN JUST PLAY 
I'LL GO OFF BALANCE IF I DO THAT YEAH 
MY CAREER AS A DRUMMER I STARTED I WOULD SAY 
AS A FULLY FLEDGED DRUMMER AT SIXTEEN LEARNING THE TRADE 
WITH VARIOUS BANDS' 
I THEN JOINED A GENTLEMAN FROM BIRMINGHAM CALLED STEVE GIBBONS 
QUITE A FAMOUS GUY IN THAT AREA AND STILL IS AND I WAS WITH HIM FOR TEN YEARS 
AND NOW TEACH QUITE OFTEN 
AND STILL WORK FOR A LIVING 
I LIVE HERE IN THE PEAK DISTRICT 
AND THAT FOR ME IS AT THE MOMENT A GET AWAY 
I'M THERE ALL THE TIME SO 
TO COME BACK HOME IS LIKE A RELIEF 
AND IT'S I THINK ONE OF THE BEST PLACES TO BE 
PRACTISING UP HERE IS ALSO REALLY GOOD COS THERE'S NO ONE AROUND 
SO I CAN HIT THOSE DRUMS AS HARD AS I WANT AND NO ONE'LL CARE 
YOU KNOW EARLIER I HEARD YOU DOING 
THAT THAT I'VE NO HEARD YOU PLAY FOR A LONG TIME 
THAT PORCARO SHUFFLE 
CAN YOU PLAY THAT 
PEOPLE ASSUME THAT BECAUSE HE'S YOUR SON YOU'VE FORCED HIM TO PLAY 
AND BE A DRUMMER I SUPPOSE WHAT I DID I DID A LITTLE BIT 
BECAUSE I BOUGHT THIS LITTLE BABY KIT OFF A FRIEND 
AND I PLONKED IT IN THE LOUNGE AND KIND OF LET DAN WALK AROUND IT 
AND WITHIN A FEW WEEKS HE WAS ON IT HE WAS PLAYING IT 
HE SAT ME DOWN AT IT AND TAUGHT ME HOW TO HOLD THE STICKS OR WHATEVER 
AND JUST LET ME PLAY ON IT FOR HOURS 
WHICH I DID 
DAN QUICKLY DEVELOPED AS A DRUMMER 
BUT WHEN HE WAS TWELVE AND WENT TO CHETHAM'S SCHOOL OF MUSIC 
THERE WERE OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN A WIDER RANGE OF INSTRUMENTS 
I WANTED TO LEARN ALL OF PERCUSSION 
SO THAT'S ALL THE TUNED STUFF AS WELL 
WHICH I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 
PIANO AS WELL WAS A MAIN THING I WANTED TO DO 
WHICH AGAIN I HADN'T EVER LIKE TOUCHED 
AND I COULDN'T READ ANY MUSIC EITHER SO IN MUSIC THEORY 
I WASN'T UP TO THE STANDARD EVERYONE ELSE WAS WHEN I WENT TO CHET'S 
I THINK DANIEL'S DEVELOPED AS A DRUMMER AND A PERCUSSIONIST 
SINCE BEING AT CHET'S I THINK HE'S JUST PROGRESSED AND 
HE DOESN'T TELL ME A LOT 
WHEN I FOUND OUT HOW HE'S PROGRESSED IS WHEN I WATCH HIM 
AND THEN I GO WOW THAT'S MY LAD 
AND I'M DEAD PROUD OF HIM 
DAVE HAS GONE HOME TO BOURNEMOUTH WHERE HE'S SQUEEZING IN 
A SAMBA BAND PRACTICE WITH HIS MUM AND BROTHER ALAN 
GREAT TO PLAY WITH SO MANY PEOPLE AND CREATING SUCH A GREAT GROOVE AND STUFF AND 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN DO ON YOUR OWN WHICH IS WHY I LOVE TO COME BACK AND HELP OUT AGAIN' 
I STARTED OFF BEING THEIR TRANSPORT 
AND I WENT TO ALL THE GIGS WITH THEM AND THEN 
ONE OF THE BROTHERS SAID WHY DON'T YOU JOIN IN I'M NOT MUSICAL 
BUT I SAID WELL O. K. 
THE FOUNDERS OF THE SAMBA BAND WERE TWO OF DAVE'S FORMER TEACHERS 
I WAS ONE OF THE THREE THAT STARTED THIS COMMUNITY GROUP REALLY 
AND DAVE AND HIS BROTHER ALAN AND HIS MUM BECAME INVOLVED 
HE WAS VERY VERY KEEN IT WAS A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT 
THAN HAVING LESSONS AT SCHOOL 
I HADN'T BEEN TEACHING DAVE THAT LONG 
AND I THOUGHT HE CAN REALLY GO PLACES 
HE REALLY I HAD TO LOOK AT MY TEACHING 
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS UP TO HIS PLAYING IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN 
I THINK THE FIRST MEMORY I HAVE OF BEING INTERESTED IN PERCUSSION 
WAS WHEN I WAS ABOUT THREE YEARS OLD 
AND MY DAD TOOK ME AROUND THE CORNER 
JUST A MINUTE'S WALK AROUND THE CORNER 
AND A BAND WAS PLAYING OUTSIDE THE LOCAL SHOP 
AND ME JUST BEING TRANSFIXED ON THE DRUMMER THEN I CAME BACK HERE 
AND GOT EVERYTHING I COULD TURNED IT UPSIDE DOWN AND STARTED 
STARTED BANGING IT WITH CHOPSTICKS WOODEN SPOONS THINGS LIKE THAT 
JOHN AND I AREN'T MUSICAL WE LOVE MUSIC 
BUT WE HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE HOW TO PLAY ANY INSTRUMENTS 
WE'VE GOT THREE BOYS AND ROBERT STARTED IT ALL OFF ON THE TRUMPET 
AND THEN ALAN WENT ON EUPHONIUM THEN DAVID STARTED DRUM KIT FIRST 
AND THEN HE WANTED THE TRUMPET SO I HAD TWO TRUMPETERS TWO DRUM KITS' 
AND A EUPHONIUM SO PRETTY NOISY HOUSEHOLD 
FIRST TIME I STARTED PLAYING PERCUSSION PROPERLY 
WAS PROBABLY STARTED OFF ON THE DRUM KIT ABOUT AGE SEVEN 
THEN MOVED ON TO PERCUSSION GRADUAL KIND OF PROCESS 
WHEN I THINK I WAS ABOUT TEN OR ELEVEN 
SINCE THEN I'VE JUST YOU KNOW 
BEEN EXPOSED TO QUITE A FEW DIFFERENT STYLES OF MUSIC 
HE'S BEEN THROUGH DORSET YOUTH PERCUSSION ENSEMBLE 
THE DORSET YOUTH ORCHESTRA THE WIND ORCHESTRA 
HE'S DONE THE JAZZ 
HE'S DONE THE SAMBA 
SO HE'S GOT ALL THESE STYLES UNDER HIS BELT WHICH FOR A PERCUSSIONIST 
YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE 
YOU NEED TO KNOW THE STYLES REALLY TO PLAY THESE THINGS 
AND DAVE'S GOT IT 
I'VE LIVED HERE ALL MY LIFE IN ROCHDALE SO I WAS BROUGHT UP ON THE FARM 
VERY PRIVILEGED TO BE BROUGHT UP ON A FARM I THINK 
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THAT SORT OF FORTUNE SO 
I FEEL VERY LUCKY FOR THAT 
MY PARENTS USED TO WATCH QUEEN VIDEOS 
AND I USED TO COPY THE QUEEN DRUMMER ROGER TAYLOR 
AND THEN I ALWAYS USED TO MAKE MASSIVE SET UPS WITH BUCKETS IN THE BARN 
AND JUST PLAY ON THOSE 
I DESTROYED ONE OF MY MUM'S IRONING BOARDS AS WELL 
JUST BY THUMPING AWAY AT IT 
ORIGINALLY HE HAD THE BEDROOM 
ABOVE WHERE WE ARE NOW 
AND IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE HE HAD HIS DRUM KIT IN THERE 
AND WE ENDED UP WITH CRACKS IN THE CEILING 
AND SO IT WAS THEN THAT WE DECIDED THAT BY THE END OF SUMMER 
WE'D HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER PLAN AND THAT WAS WHEN WE GOT HIM IN THE 
WE GOT HOLD OF AN OLD BATTERED PORTAKABIN 
WHICH BECAME HIS PRACTICE ROOM IT WAS REALLY JUST TO SAVE THE 
THE STRUCTURE OF THE HOUSE AND OUR SANITY AND OUR SANITY YEAH 
WHEN HE WAS IN YEAR SIX HIS PERCUSSION TEACHER AT ROCHDALE MUSIC CENTRE 
ADVISED ME THAT HE MAY BE GOOD ENOUGH TO GO TO CHETHAM'S 
WE DID LOOK ROUND THE SCHOOL 
HE WAS ADAMANT THAT HE WANTED TO GO TO WARDLE HIGH SCHOOL 
AND BE IN THE BRASS BAND AT WARDLE HIGH SCHOOL AT THAT STAGE 
AND SO HE WENT TO THE LOCAL SECONDARY SCHOOL 
IT WAS REALLY AT THE END OF YEAR EIGHT WASN'T IT 
THAT IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE WAS GOING TO TAKE MUSIC UP AS A CAREER 
AND WE THOUGHT REALLY 
HE NEEDED THE BEST MUSICAL EDUCATION THAT HE COULD GET 
JIM WAS VERY LUCKY AS THE BEST MUSICAL EDUCATION POSSIBLE 
WAS AVAILABLE JUST DOWN THE ROAD IN MANCHESTER AT CHETHAM'S 
ONCE THERE HE'D BE TAUGHT BY ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S LEADING PERCUSSION TEACHERS 
BEING TAUGHT BY PAUL PATRICK HAS DEFINITELY HELPED ME DEVELOP AS A PLAYER 
BECAUSE HE'S WORKED A LOT ON TECHNIQUE 
AND THINGS I HADN'T REALLY COVERED BEFORE I WENT TO CHET'S 
AGAIN SUCH AS FOUR MALLET PLAYING AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
SO IT'S BROADENED THE HORIZON A LOT 
WHEN YOU DO GET OUT THERE THE EXPANSION OF THAT RANGE IS BIGGER ANYWAY SO 
JIM PARTICULARLY WAS VERY KEEN AND IS STILL VERY KEEN ON EASTERN EUROPEAN FOLK MUSIC 
AND IT'S REFLECTED IN ONE OF THE PIECES HE'S PLAYING 
WHICH REALLY DOES HAVE THAT SORT OF HUNGARIAN YOU KNOW MID EUROPEAN SOUND TO IT 
SO HE'S REALLY INTO THAT SIDE OF THINGS' 
IT'S QUITE A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO BE TAUGHT 
BY ONE OF THE FOREMOST ORCHESTRAL PERCUSSIONISTS IN THE COUNTRY 
IT'S SATURDAY THE HIGHLIGHT OF DELIA'S WEEK 
I WAKE UP FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY IN THE MORNING TO CATCH THE TRAIN TO MANCHESTER 
TO THE ROYAL NORTHERN COLLEGE OF MUSIC 
IT'S TIRING BECAUSE OF EARLY MORNINGS AND THE LONG TRAIN JOURNEY 
BUT IT'S WORTH IT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I'LL GET THAT LEVEL OF TEACHING ANYWHERE ELSE 
IT'S SUCH A LOVELY ENVIRONMENT TO WORK IN 
AND I'VE GOT LOTS OF FRIENDS HERE 
AND I GET TO DO THE THING THAT I LOVE MUSIC 
DELIA IS OUR ONLY FINALIST NOT AT A MUSIC SCHOOL FULL TIME 
BUT THE JUNIOR NORTHERN COLLEGE OF MUSIC GIVES HER THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SPECIALIST MUSIC TRAINING 
ALONG WITH THE CHANCE TO MIX WITH OTHER TALENTED YOUNG MUSICIANS 
WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS GO ROUND AND SEE THE PROGRESS 
YOU'VE BEEN MAKING THROUGHOUT THE PAST WEEK 
ACTUALLY DELIA WHY DON'T WE START WITH YOU O. K. 
I'VE NOTATED IT 
DELIA'S DAY AT THE COLLEGE IS FILLED WITH A VARIETY OF LESSONS 
INCLUDING MUSIC THEORY COMPOSITION AND PRACTICAL SESSIONS 
PERCUSSION ENSEMBLE IS REALLY GREAT COS WE GET TO PLAY LOTS OF NEW EXCITING PIECES 
FOR EXAMPLE WE JUST PLAYED REBOUNDS BY DAMIEN HARRON 
WHICH IS WRITTEN FOR TWO BASKETBALLS AND TWO BONGOS' 
CAN WE GO TO THE END 
WITH THE CATEGORY FINALS FAST APPROACHING 
DELIA'S LESSON WITH PERCUSSION TEACHER IAN FORGRIEVE 
IS A VITAL PART OF HER DAY 
GOOD NOW I THINK A FEW MORE GOES AT THAT YEAH 
YOU'LL MAKE THAT YOU KNOW REALLY REALLY EXCITING 
DELIA I FIRST MET ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO 
I WAS INSTANTLY IMPRESSED WITH HOW SHE WAS SO DEDICATED 
TO HER MUSIC MAKING AND SHE JUST LAPS EVERYTHING UP LIKE A SPONGE 
SHE CAN'T GET ENOUGH MUSIC MAKING SHE LISTENS CAREFULLY TO YOUR IDEAS AND HAS PLENTY OF HER OWN 
WHEN YOU GO TO THE COWBELL AND GET THE GROOVE GOING 
JUST BE A LITTLE BIT MORE FLAMBOYANT LIKE IT'S FIESTA TIME 
I'VE SEEN A HUGE AMOUNT OF DEVELOPMENT IN DELIA'S PLAYING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS' 
ON A WEEKLY BASIS SHE PLAYS PIECES VERY QUICKLY 
IS VERY CONSCIENTIOUS ABOUT SORTING OUT ALL THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF IT 
AND THEN SHE INJECTS A LOT OR HER OWN PERSONALITY INTO THAT PLAYING 
AND MORE SO AS SHE GROWS IN CONFIDENCE AND MUSICAL PERSONALITY 
AS THE CATEGORY FINAL APPROACHES 
DAN AND HIS FAMILY HAVE ONE LAST CHANCE TO RELAX TOGETHER 
AT HOME IN THE PEAK DISTRICT 
I DID A RUN THROUGH THE OTHER DAY OF MY PROGRAMME 
I'M FEELING QUITE CONFIDENT COS IT WENT QUITE WELL 
MAKING SURE EVERYTHING IS AS GOOD AS I CAN GET IT 
IF I DO GET THROUGH TO THE GRAND FINAL 
WE'LL BE NERVOUS 
BUT AGAIN I THINK FROM MY POINT OF VIEW 
I THINK YOU'RE QUIETLY CONFIDENT AND 
AND I KNOW DAN'LL ENJOY JUST PERFORMING 
AND PLAYING I MEAN IT WOULD BE 
REALLY EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD IF HE GOT THROUGH TO THE GRAND FINAL 
BUT HE'S DONE REALLY WELL TO GET THIS FAR OH YEAH 
ABSOLUTELY WE'RE SO PROUD OF HIM YEAH 
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE 
I'VE DONE QUITE A LOT OF WORK SINCE THE LAST ROUND 
DEFINITELY MORE WORK THAN I DID BEFORE THE LAST ROUND 
I THINK I'M BETTER PREPARED THIS TIME 
SO I'M QUITE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT 
QUITE ENJOY NOT HAVING TO LISTEN TO HIM PRACTISING 
I DON'T KNOW WITH HIM BEING AT CHETHAM'S I DON'T KNOW THE PIECES 
HE GOES AWAY AND PRACTISES BY HIMSELF 
SO IF HE MAKES MISTAKES ACTUALLY I DON'T ALWAYS REALISE ANYWAY 
SO I JUST YOU KNOW I CAN SIT BACK AND ENJOY IT 
HE'S DONE REALLY WELL TO GET AS FAR AS HE HAS 
AND IF HE GETS NO FURTHER IT'S REALLY A FANTASTIC ACHIEVEMENT 
OBVIOUSLY 
I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM WIN 
I THINK HE'S GOT THE ABILITY TO WIN 
IT JUST DEPENDS HOW IT GOES ON THE NIGHT YEAH WE THINK SO YEAH 
BACK IN LONDON AT TRINITY COLLEGE 
DAVE ELLIOT IS FINE TUNING ONE OF HIS COMPETITION PIECES 
I'M JUST ABOUT TO PLAY COLD PRESSED 
WHICH IS MY MULTI PERCUSSION PIECE FOR THIS ROUND 
IT'S GOT A LOT OF COWBELLS AND WOOD BLOCKS AS YOU CAN SEE 
IT'S A GOOD PIECE FOR ME 
COS IT SHOWS OFF MY ABILITY ON MULTIPLE PERCUSSION 
LOTS OF TRICKY PARTS AROUND HERE ALL THESE BLOCKS HERE AND ALSO 
SOME REALLY NICE ATMOSPHERIC BITS IN THE MIDDLE 
SO ALL IN ALL I THINK IT'S QUITE A NICE PIECE 
THE PREPARATION IS GOING STEADY 
AND I FOUND THAT I WORK BEST WHEN I LEAVE IT LATER YOU KNOW 
TO KEEP IT FRESH AND THINGS' 
OBVIOUSLY NOT TOO LATE YOU KNOW I LIKE TO 
I WANNA BE ON TOP OF ALL THE NOTES 
AND HAVE IT ALL UNDER MUSCLE MEMORY AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
I HAVE BEEN PRACTISING QUITE HARD 
TO GET EVERYTHING UP TO THE YOU KNOW APPROPRIATE STANDARD 
OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS I'VE BEEN PRACTISING EVERY SPARE MINUTE I CAN 
AND IT'S GOOD I HAD HALF TERM SO I HAD QUITE A LOT OF TIME DURING THAT 
DURING SCHOOL IT'S HARDER COS YOU'RE EXHAUSTED AT THE END OF THE DAY 
YOU HAVE TO GO HOME AND PRACTISE AND IT'S LIKE YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP 
A POSITIVE ATTITUDE COS THEN YOUR PRACTICE WILL BE BETTER 
I'M NATURALLY QUITE COMPETITIVE SO I PUSH MYSELF 
BUT I TRY NOT TO GO OVERBOARD 
WHATEVER SHE HAS ACHIEVED SO FAR I THINK IS 
TO ME IS AMAZING WHAT LEVEL 
BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT'S THE BEST KNOWN COMPETITION IN ENGLAND 
AND IN HER AGE IT'S PROBABLY ALSO THE HIGHEST LEVEL SHE COULD ACHIEVE 
AND PLAYING IN THE CATEGORY FINAL 
I THINK IS AN ENORMOUS ACHIEVEMENT ALREADY 
THE DAY OF THE CATEGORY FINALS HAS ARRIVED 
AND OUR FOUR PERCUSSIONISTS HAVE COME TO THE ROYAL WELSH COLLEGE OF MUSIC AND DRAMA IN CARDIFF 
WHERE PREPARATIONS FOR THE EVENING ARE WELL UNDER WAY 
THEY'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH THE COMPETITION ROUNDS SINCE LAST SUMMER 
TONIGHT WILL BE THE END OF THE JOURNEY FOR ALL BUT ONE OF THEM 
AS THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE IN THE GRAND FINAL UP FOR GRABS 
ON THE ACTUAL DAY OF COMPETITION 
I TRY AND DO A GOOD WARM UP IN THE MORNING 
AND MAKE SURE I'M COMFORTABLE WITH EVERYTHING 
SO THAT I CAN GO INTO MY REHEARSAL ON THE STAGE YOU KNOW THINKING 
THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD JUST BE LIKE LAST TIME YOU KNOW 
IT'S ALL GOOD NOT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING 
IN THE STAGE REHEARSAL IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET YOUR SET UP 
TO LIKE INCH PERFECT EVEN MILLIMETRE PERFECT YOU COULD SAY 
COS WITH MULTI PERCUSSION PIECES WHERE YOU'RE USING AN ARRAY OF DRUMS 
IT COULD BE JUST THAT LITTLE BIT THAT MAKES YOU HIT A RIM OR 
JUST MISS IT AND YOU LOSE A STICK AND THEN THAT GOES FLYING AND HITS SOMEONE 
IN XENAKIS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR EVERYTHING TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE 
COS IT'S QUITE A DIFFICULT PIECE AND SOME OF IT'S QUITE FAST 
SO IF YOU MISS THE DRUM IT'S GONNA BE QUITE OBVIOUS 
THE BODHRAN IS GONNA BE AN ISSUE UNDER ALL THE LIGHTS 
BECAUSE THE SKIN ON THE FRONT OF THE BODHRAN IS MADE OF GOAT 
SO IT'S VERY SENSITIVE TO HEAT AND LIGHT 
SO IT TIGHTENS UP AND LOOSENS ACCORDINGLY 
BUT I'VE GOT A LITTLE SPRAY BOTTLE OF WATER WHICH SHOULD HELP AMEND THE SITUATION 
I'D LOVE TO GET TO THE FINAL BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY 
YOU'VE GOT TO THINK THAT IF YOU DON'T 
WELL THE JUDGES IT'S THEIR OPINION 
AND WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO IN LATER LIFE 
COS IT'S THREE PEOPLE'S OPINION 
SO YOU CAN'T LOOK AT YOURSELF TOO BADLY IF YOU DON'T GET THROUGH 
YOU STILL GET THAT FEELING IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND IF YOU DO GET THROUGH THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO 
YOU KNOW STRAIGHT AFTER 
I THINK EVERYONE IS WANTING TO GET THROUGH NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT 
REACHING THIS STAGE LAST TIME TO BE HONEST I WAS HAPPY TO GET HERE AGAIN REALLY 
BASICALLY I ENTERED THIS COMPETITION BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED TO KEEP UP 
ALL MY PERCUSSION PLAYING AND MAKE SURE I WAS STILL PLAYING TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY 
THIS IS A GOOD COMPETITION TO BE IN TO KEEP YOU PRACTISING HARD 
I REALLY WANT TO GET THROUGH BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE AMAZING 
I'D LOVE THAT EXPERIENCE OF PLAYING AS A SOLOIST WITH AN ORCHESTRA 
THE START OF THE COMPETITION IS JUST MOMENTS AWAY 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE HERE AND THE JUDGES ARE TAKING THEIR SEATS 
WE ARE REALLY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL YOU KNOW THAT SPARK OF MAGIC 
WE ARE LOOKING FOR THAT ALL ROUND PERFORMER SOMEONE THAT REALLY 
TAKES THEIR ROLE AS A PERFORMER AND ENGAGES THE AUDIENCE 
AND HAVING HEARD THE PERCUSSIONISTS PERFORM IN THE SEMIFINALS 
I THINK ALL FOUR ARE CAPABLE OF DOING THAT TONIGHT 
THERE'S SOME REALLY GOOD PLAYERS REALLY NICE CHARACTERS 
A COUPLE OF COMPOSERS AS WELL SO IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW IT GOES DOWN 
IT'LL BE A TOUGH DECISION TONIGHT 
JOINING COMPOSER AND CONDUCTOR BEN FOSTER IN MAKING THAT TOUGH DECISION 
ARE RENOWNED PERCUSSIONISTS ALASDAIR MALLOY AND MARK GLENTWORTH 
FIRST UP DELIA STEVENS 
DELIA OPENED WITH THAT XENAKIS PIECE A GREAT START TO THE EVENING 
HOW DID YOU FIND HER PERFORMANCE OF REBONDS I THOUGHT SHE HAD A REALLY GOOD FEEL 
I THOUGHT SHE PUT THE PIECE ACROSS VERY WELL VERY ENGAGING 
I FELT SHE DIDN'T REALLY GET AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH 
IT WAS VERY WELL PLAYED BUT I FELT I WANTED MORE EXTREMES IT'S A VERY ANGULAR PIECE 
AND ONE OF YOUR BIGGEST TOOLS IS THE DYNAMICS 
I JUST FELT THE EXTREMES HAVE GOT TO BE THERE IN THIS PIECE 
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT SHE STARTED REALLY WELL 
I JUST FELT I COULD SEE HER LOSING ENERGY AS THE PIECE WENT ON 
I THOUGHT SHE'D GONE FOR IT SO MUCH BUT TAPERED OUT AT THE END 
I LIKED THE TEMPO SHE STARTED AT AND YOU'RE RIGHT IT DID FEEL AS IF SHE WAS GETTING TIRED TOWARDS THE END 
BUT IT WAS A GREAT START AND I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY MUSCULAR STICKING STUFF THAT SHE WAS DOING 
HER MARIMBA PLAYING I REALLY ENJOYED MARK I THOUGHT IT WAS SUBTLE VERY BEAUTIFUL 
DEFINITELY VERY MUSICAL 
IT WAS ENGAGING SHE DREW US IN 
I FELT IN THE MARIMBA PIECE SHE ACTUALLY PULLED US IN TOWARDS HER 
I THOUGHT SHE HAD THE MELODY REALLY NICELY SHAPED 
AND IT WAS NICE AND FLOWING 
BUT SHE WAS DOING REALLY NICE THINGS WITH THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURE THERE WERE LOTS OF INTEREST 
BUT NEVER AT THE EXPENSE OF MELODY SHE PLAYED FANTASTICALLY WELL 
THAT QUASI MANDOLIN TECHNIQUE SHE WAS DOING WAS INCREDIBLY WELL DONE 
THE LAST PIECE ELDORADO I'VE HEARD A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE LAST STAGE 
I FELT THERE WAS ONE THING ABOUT THIS PIECE THE MONOTONY OF THAT REPEATED FIGURE 
I DON'T THINK SHE GOT IT NO SHE DIDN'T 
IT LOST MOMENTUM WHICH IS A SHAME AS IT'S AN EXCITING PIECE 
SHE STARTED THE FINAL PIECE VERY WELL 
AND I THOUGHT GREAT GOOD FOR YOU 
BUT AS YOU SAID ONCE WE GOT INTO IT IT WAS HARD TO FIND THE RHYTHM 
AND THAT OSTENATO GOING ON WITH THE COW BELL AT THE BOTTOM OF IT WAS TOO MUFFLED 
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DRIVING EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WAS HAPPENING 
SO IT WAS DIFFICULT I FELT AS A LISTENER 
TO REALLY ENGAGE WITH WHAT SHE FELT SHE OBVIOUSLY FELT ABOUT THE PIECE 
BECAUSE SHE WAS VERY COMMITTED IN HER PERFORMANCE 
YOU ALWAYS MAKE SOME MISTAKES WHEN YOU PERFORM 
BUT IT'S JUST BECAUSE I'M A PERFECTIONIST 
LET'S MOVE TO DANIEL THE XENAKIS WE AGREED COMPARED TO DELIA'S WASN'T SUCH AN ENERGETIC PERFORMANCE 
BUT HE BRAVELY PLAYED HIS OWN PIECES NORTHERN LIGHTS AND GROOVE IT UP 
HOW DO YOU FEEL HE TRANSLATED HIS COMPOSITIONS FROM THE PAGE TO THE PERFORMANCE 
DID THAT WORK AS A COMPOSER AND A PERFORMER 
IT DID I THINK THIS IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE 
I THINK WE FELT IT WASN'T EXACTLY ACCURATE IN CERTAIN PLACES 
WHEN I SAW WE WERE GOING TO BE HEARING TWO OF THE PERFORMERS 
PLAYING TWO EACH OF THEIR OWN COMPOSITIONS 
I DECIDED TO LOOK THROUGH THE MUSIC BEFORE THEY PLAYED IT 
WHILE THEY WERE RESETTING THE STAGE 
BUT THEN PUT IT TO ONE SIDE AND ACTUALLY LET THEM PLAY THE PIECE 
ACTUALLY I THOUGHT DANIEL'S SECOND PIECE NORTHERN LIGHTS I REALLY CONNECTED WITH THAT 
THE WAY HE PERFORMED IT TOOK US THROUGH IT REALLY NICELY HE'S GOT FANTASTIC TECHNIQUE 
THE TEMPTATION I THINK FOR COMPOSER SLASH PERFORMERS 
IS TO WRITE PIECES THAT SHOW OFF YOUR TECHNIQUE FOR TECHNIQUE'S SAKE 
EXACTLY 
AND I WAS WATCHING FOR ANY HINT OF THAT BUT NO I THOUGHT HE REALLY 
YOU KNOW PLAYED TO HIS STRENGTHS THEY WERE PIECES IN THEIR OWN RIGHT 
I WAS IMPRESSED WITH DANIEL I HEARD SOME REALLY GOOD PLAYING SENSITIVE PLAYING DURING NORTHERN LIGHTS 
LIKE YOU SAY HE'S A LOVELY MARIMBA PLAYER 
HE'S A GOOD PERFORMER AND HE ENGAGED HIS AUDIENCE I THOUGHT MARK THEY SEEMED TO ENJOY IT 
I THINK HE CAME INTO HIS OWN IN THE LAST PIECE 
IT WAS MORE RELAXED AND GAVE HIM A CHANCE TO SHINE 
IT WAS GOOD THE WAY HE DID HIS MULTI SET UP THING HE MOVED AROUND THE STAGE FROM ONE DRUM 
IT WAS A GOOD SHOWCASE FOR HIM I THOUGHT DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES DIFFERENT TYPES OF DRUMMING 
I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN THE LAST PIECE ENDED 
WE GOT THIS PERSONALITY COMING THROUGH A LOT OF FUN 
A LOT OF SPIRIT 
I THINK THE OVERWHELMING THING IS THAT IT'S NICE TO SEE THIS SPIRIT 
AND THIS REAL ENTHUSIASM AS COMPOSERS SLASH PERFORMERS 
AND I THINK BOTH JIM AND DANIEL DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO SELL NOT JUST THEIR PERFORMANCE 
BUT ALSO THEIR MUSIC TO US YES 
IT TELLS US MORE ABOUT THE PERSON NOT JUST 
IT GIVES US AN INSIGHT INTO THEIR MUSICAL INFLUENCES AND THEIR MIND 
IT WAS ALL RIGHT I ENJOYED IT 
I DON'T CARE NOW REALLY I PLAYED IT WAS FUN 
SO THEN JIM ROLLED ONTO THE STAGE IN HIS CONFIDENT WAY 
WITH HIS FANTASTIC SENSE OF DRESS AND IMMEDIATELY THE AUDIENCE WERE WITH HIM 
HE PUT IN A LOVELY PROGRAMME FIRST PIECE WAS A NICE FOLK MELODY 
WHICH HE PLAYED VERY BEAUTIFULLY ON THE MARIMBA 
I LIKED HIS USE OF SPACE HE REALLY BROUGHT THE AUDIENCE IN 
AND IT WAS A NICELY DEVISED PROGRAMME IN THAT WAY 
HE PULLED OFF A GOOD TRICK THERE 
WE WERE STILL APPLAUDING AFTER HIS FIRST PIECE 
AND HE'S INTO THE NEXT PIECE 
WHAT WAS NEAT ABOUT THAT WAS THAT HE GOT INTO THAT STARTLED EVERYBODY 
THEN MOVED TO HIS SET UP AT THE BACK OF THE STAGE WHICH WAS A GOOD WAY OF TAKING US WITH HIM 
THERE'S ALWAYS THESE AWKWARD MOMENTS IN PERCUSSION 
IF YOU'RE DOING A WHOLE RECITAL YOU FINISH ONE PIECE MOVE TO ANOTHER 
WHERE ARE MY STICKS HAVE I GOT THE MUSIC 
HE GOT AROUND THAT NICELY THAT WAS ANOTHER ELEMENT IN THE PROGRAMME 
I REALLY WARM TO HIM AS A PLAYER TECHNICALLY HE WAS REALLY SOUND 
BUT HE HAD TIME WITHIN WHAT HE WAS DOING TO SHOW US MORE ABOUT HIMSELF 
I FELT MORE CONNECTED TO HIM THAN SOME OF THE OTHER PLAYERS 
I THINK MORE THAT ANYONE JIM WAS AWARE THAT HE WAS PUTTING ON A SHOW 
HE HAD FIFTEEN MINUTES TO PUT ON HIS SHOW AND HE DID IT 
AND I THINK IT TAKES A BIT OF GUTS TO SLIGHTLY CHANGE THE PERCEPTION OF WHAT IT SHOULD BE 
IN THE YOUNG MUSICIAN FINAL HE MADE IT A SHOW 
AGAIN REALLY BALANCED SO MUCH IN IT GREAT TUNE PLAYING 
INCREDIBLY VIRTUOSIC 
EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM WAS ENGAGING TO THE AUDIENCE 
AND IT WAS A HIGHLIGHT FOR ME ACTUALLY JIM'S RECITAL 
IT WENT REMARKABLY WELL ACTUALLY 
I'M CHUFFED WITH THAT IF NOT A LITTLE SURPRISED 
SO THEN WE MOVED ON TO DAVID I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING HIS CHARLIE PARKER 
I KNOW YOU WERE MARK I THINK I SHARED A JOKE WITH YOU 
I'VE TRIED TO PLAY THIS TUNE MYSELF AND NEVER REALLY MANAGED IT 
I REALLY LIKED HIS PERFORMANCE AND EVERYTHING HE DID 
I FELT HE WAS A REALLY MATURE PERFORMER AND I JUST LOVED HIS VIBES PLAYING 
DID YOU NOTICE HE EVEN HAD TIME FOR THE JAZZER'S JOKE THERE WAS A LITTLE LOOK 
OVER TO THE PIANIST THAT LITTLE SMILE A GENUINE MOMENT 
SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT PROBABLY NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE THAT MADE ME THINK HE'S AT HOME DOING THIS 
I WONDERED ABOUT THIS I THOUGHT O. K. YOU'RE TAKING US INTO THE JAZZ WORLD NOW 
WITH YOUR CHOICE OF MATERIAL AND THE CHOICE OF ACCOMPANISTS 
WHO BOTH PLAYED VERY WELL VERY WELL INDEED 
BUT I THOUGHT HE SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED THE CONTEXT HE WAS PLAYING THE PIECE IN 
BECAUSE HE PLAYED IT LIKE A JAZZ PERFORMANCE 
BUT WHEN THE PIANIST TOOK A SOLO AND HE WAS JUST COMPING 
WE KIND OF LOST THE FOCUS WITH HIM 
I THOUGHT HE SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED RESTRUCTURING THE ARRANGEMENT 
SO WE KEPT WITH HIM RATHER THAN SHIFTING OVER TO THE PIANIST 
I DID FEEL HE WAS PHRASING AND FEELING THE MUSIC RATHER THAN JUST PLAYING IT JUST AS AN EXERCISE 
THERE WAS GENUINE INTERACTION WITH HIM AND HIS PALS AND IT REALLY WORKED 
I WAS IMPRESSED WITH DAVID AS WE CONTINUED 
THE NEXT PIECE I THOUGHT WAS SOME OF THE NICEST MARIMBA PLAYING WE HEARD ALL NIGHT 
IT WAS REALLY SENSITIVE AND COLOURFUL AND TO BE HONEST 
I LISTENED AND I WAS REALLY ENRAPTURED WITH IT 
WHICH DIDN'T HAPPEN WITH SOME OF THE OTHER PERFORMANCES FOR ME PERSONALLY 
WHAT DID YOU THINK ALASDAIR 
WELL FOR ME I FELT HE COULD HAVE USED THAT SECOND PIECE MUCH BETTER 
HE HAD THE MELODY THERE ALL THE TIME THAT WAS REALLY NICELY POINTED OUT 
BUT NOT MUCH ELSE GOING ON 
I REALLY ENJOYED THE WAY HE PLAYED THE MARIMBA 
THAT SORT OF CONTROL IS DIFFICULT AND HE PLAYED IT BEAUTIFULLY 
MAYBE IF HE'D STARTED WITH THAT I THINK THAT'S A PROGRAMMING ISSUE 
THE PROBLEM WITH THE THREE PIECES IS THE OBVIOUS FINISHING PIECE IS THE DRUMMING 
BUT REALLY IF WE'D HAD THAT AFTER THE JAZZ VIBRAPHONE PIECE 
WE'D HAVE SEEN THE CONTRAST AND COULD HAVE GONE OUT ON A BEAUTIFUL MARIMBA PIECE 
IT MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN A CASE OF RESHUFFLING THE PROGRAMME A BIT 
I LIKED THE WAY HE POSITIONED HIMSELF SO WE SAW HIM SIDE ON 
SO WE COULD ACTUALLY SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON 
PHYSICALLY AS A PERFORMER HE'S VERY NICE TO WATCH 
HE'S VERY NATURAL IT SEEMS HE'S VERY COMMITTED VERY CONCENTRATED 
IN THE FINAL PIECE HE LOST ME A COUPLE OF TIMES 
IN BETWEEN A COUPLE OF THE SECTIONS HE STOPPED PICKED UP HIS STICKS WIPED HIS NOSE 
THERE WAS A NOTE IN THE SCORE I SAW THAT MARK IT SAID STAND STILL FOR SIX SECONDS 
HE DID THAT BUT THEN AT THE END OF THE SIX SECONDS HE KIND OF DROPPED HIS FOCUS 
YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY BE AWARE OF THE SILENCES AND ANY MOVEMENTS YOU HAVE TO MAKE 
WITHOUT GOING TOO FAR I THINK THEY HAVE TO BE A BIT STYLISED TO KEEP US IN THE LINE OF THE PIECE 
I WAS VERY HAPPY I FELT QUITE COMFORTABLE 
ALTHOUGH A LOT OF LITTLE THINGS COULD HAVE GONE BETTER 
BUT THEY WERE LITTLE THINGS 
NOTHING MAJOR HAPPENED WHICH IS ALWAYS POSITIVE 
THE JUDGES NOW HAVE TO DECIDE WHO WILL REPRESENT THE PERCUSSION CATEGORY IN THE GRAND FINAL 
OUR FOUR COMPETITORS HAVE DONE ALL THEY CAN 
TO WATCH IT WAS NERVE WRACKING 
HORRIBLE AND ER I DON'T WANT TO MAKE ANY JUDGEMENT ABOUT IT BECAUSE I'M BIASED 
I'M VERY PROUD OF HIM I WAS GROOVING WERE YOU YEAH 
HE WAS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 
I THINK HE REALLY ENJOYED HIS PERFORMANCE THAT'S THE THING HE'LL BE PLEASED ABOUT 
THERE'S ALWAYS BITS HE KNOWS HE CAN IMPROVE ON BUT THAT'S DANIEL 
WELL I THINK HE PLAYED AS WELL AS HE COULD PLAY 
JIM'S HAPPY WITH IT AND I DON'T THINK HE COULD HAVE IMPROVED IT REALLY 
WE'RE VERY PROUD I THOUGHT HE DID VERY WELL 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE JUDGES ARE LOOKING FOR AND THEY ALL PLAYED SUPERBLY 
FOR THE JUDGES IT'S DECISION TIME 
WAS THERE ANYONE TONIGHT ALASDAIR FOR YOU THAT REALLY STOOD OUT AND SHONE 
WELL THERE WERE INDIVIDUAL PIECES BY INDIVIDUAL PERFORMERS THAT REALLY STOOD OUT FOR ME 
WHEN DAVID STARTED OFF I THOUGHT PERHAPS HE WAS GOING TO TOP HIM 
BUT IT LEFT ME UNDECIDED AT THE END MARK WHAT DID YOU FEEL 
TAKING EVERYTHING INTO ACCOUNT 
DAVID JUST HAD THE OVERALL SORT OF MATURITY 
AND THERE WERE JUST THINGS THAT HE DID THAT REACHED ME MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE 
BUT THAT'S BEING TOUGH ON EVERYONE ELSE BECAUSE I ENJOYED EVERYONE'S PROGRAMME 
JIM ALSO WAS A GREAT PERFORMER 
FOR ME IT'S GOING TO BE A REALLY TOUGH CHOICE I HAVE TO SAY BETWEEN JIM AND DAVID 
THERE'S A SPARK THAT JIM HAS THAT DAVID DOESN'T AS A PERFORMER BUT THERE ARE THINGS ABOUT DAVID 
THAT I THINK PERSONALLY SET HIM ABOVE JIM 
O. K. THERE'S TWO CONSECUTIVE EVENINGS AT THE ALBERT HALL TICKETS ARE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EACH 
THE FIRST IS AN EVENING WITH JIM MOLYNEUX THE SECOND WITH DAVID ELLIOT 
MARK WHICH WOULD YOU BUY A TICKET FOR 
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO WITH DAVID 
ALTHOUGH I FEEL VERY SORRY FOR JIM 
BECAUSE HE'S ALSO A FANTASTIC PERCUSSIONIST 
INTERESTINGLY I WOULD GO WITH JIM 
I KNOW THAT DOESN'T HELP BUT I JUST THOUGHT HE SHOWED US MORE 
ON THE BASIS OF WHAT HE SHOWED US TONIGHT I THINK I'D BE MORE ENGAGED WITH THAT 
SO IT'S A SPLIT DECISION 
THE CASTING VOTE IS WITH BEN 
IT'S MY GREAT PLEASURE TO ANNOUNCE THE WINNER OF THE CATEGORY FINAL OF PERCUSSION 
THE PERSON GOING THROUGH TO THE GRAND FINAL OF B. B. C. YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

SO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD JIM MOLYNEUX WILL GO ON TO REPRESENT THE PERCUSSION CATEGORY 
AT THE B. B. C. YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR GRAND FINAL 
JIM WILL BE TAKING ON FOUR OTHER CATEGORY FINALISTS AT WALES MILLENNIUM CENTRE THIS WEEKEND 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN COULD WE ASK JIM TO COME BACK ON STAGE WITH OUR OTHER THREE FANTASTIC FINALISTS 
IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION TONIGHT WE REALLY STRUGGLED TO MAKE OUR FINAL DECISION 
IT WAS VERY CLOSE ALL FOUR PERFORMERS WERE FANTASTIC 
THERE WAS JUST A TINY TINY FRACTION OF AN INCH BETWEEN THEM TONIGHT 
AND JIM WAS A WORTHY WINNER I THINK 
WHAT JUST HAPPENED 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT JUST HAPPENED IT'S JUST AMAZING 
IT WAS A REALLY TOUGH DECISION BUT JIM HAD THAT INGREDIENT THAT EXTRA SPARK 
WELL DONE MATE I'M DEAD PLEASED 
HE PLAYED FANTASTICALLY I HAD EVERY CONFIDENCE IN HIM
