WHEN I SAY GENERAL FRENCH I DON'T MEAN HE'S A FRENCH GENERAL 
GENERAL FRENCH WAS AN ENGLISH GENERAL SOME FIND THAT CONFUSING 
BUT I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT HIM I WAS TALKING ABOUT KITCHENER 
HE WAS GETTING WORRIED ABOUT RECRUITING HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO RUN OUT OF MEN 
HE WAS GETTING INTO HIS ROLLS WHEN HE NOTICED THE DASHBOARD WAS ALL MINGY 
HE TURNED TO HIS DRIVER AND SAID WHY IS MY DASHBOARD SO MINGY 
WELL SAID THE DRIVER IT'S THIS FOREIGN MAHOGANY WE NEED ENGLISH WOOD WE NEED YEW
