HEY HEY ARE YOU READY TO PLAY 
COME AND PLAY SAFE WITH THE TWEENIES 
HEY HEY WHAT DO YOU SAY 
COME AND PLAY SAFE IT'S COOL TO PLAY SAFE 
HAVE FUN AND PLAY SAFE WITH THE TWEENIES 
BE SAFE WITH THE TWEENIES 
ROAD SAFETY 
HELLO THERE 
ME AND MY TWO FRIENDS CONNOR AND GRACE 
ARE OFF TO THE PARK FOR A PLAY ON THE SWINGS AND A GAME OF FOOTBALL 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A WALK AND WE DO HAVE TO CROSS A ROAD OR TWO 
SO WE'LL HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL AND KEEP OURSELVES SAFE 
WE HAVE TO KEEP TOGETHER SO YOU TWO STAY ON THAT SIDE OF THE PAVEMENT 
AND I'LL WALK ON THE ROAD SIDE LET'S GO 
WOW MAX IS GOING TO THE PARK TO PLAY FOOTBALL WITH FRIENDS COOL 
THEY MIGHT HAVE TO CROSS A BUSY ROAD I HOPE THEY LOOKPROPERLY 
LET'S GIVE THEM HELP IN CASE THEY FORGET 
YEAH 
OH I MUST SAY I LOVE GETTING OUT FOR A WALK AND A BIT OF EXERCISE 
SO LONG AS WE LOOK AFTER OURSELVES THOUGH 
STOP MAX YOU MUST LOOK AROUND FOR A SAFE PLACE TO CROSS THE ROAD 
THERE'S A ZEBRA CROSSING WE'LL USE THAT 
AT A ZEBRA CROSSING WAIT FOR THE TRAFFIC TO STOP BEFORE YOU CROSS 
DON'T FORGET TO LOOK AND LISTEN ALL THE TIME 
THERE WE ARE ALL SAFELY ON THE OTHER SIDE 
WE'VE GOT A BIT FURTHER TO GO AND A FEW MORE ROADS TO CROSS 
SO WE MUST MAKE SURE WE USE THE SAFEST WAYS OF CROSSING LET'S GO 
THE BEST PLACE IS PELICAN CROSSINGS WITH RED AND GREEN MAN LIGHTS 
PUSH THE BUTTON AND WAIT 
IF YOU SEE A RED MAN OR A FLASHING GREEN MAN DON'T CROSS 
WHEN YOU SEE A GREEN MAN THAT ISN'T FLASHING 
IT'S SAFE TO CROSS THE ROAD 
FOOTBRIDGES TUNNELS OR SUBWAYS ARE MADE FOR GETTING TO THE OTHER SIDE 
IF YOU SEE A LOLLIPOP LADY OR MAN THEY CAN HELP YOU CROSS AS WELL 
THERE'S THE PARK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD 
BUT I CAN'T SEE A ZEBRA CROSSING OR A PELICAN CROSSING FOR US TO USE 
AND THERE'S NOT A FOOTBRIDGE OR A TUNNEL 
NOR IS THERE A LOLLIPOP LADY OR MAN TO HELP US CROSS THE ROAD 
WE'LL HAVE TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL DON'T CROSS BETWEEN TWO PARKED CARS 
YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT'S COMING 
JUST WALK DOWN HERE BECAUSE WE'LL GET A BETTER VIEW OF THE TRAFFIC 
WE'LL STOP HERE 
A LITTLE BIT BACK FROM THE EDGE OF THE PAVEMENT 
NOW LOOK IN BOTH DIRECTIONS 
LISTENING ALL THE TIME FOR ANY TRAFFIC 
IF THE ROAD IS CLEAR YOU CAN CROSS SAFELY NOW 
KEEP LOOKING AND LISTENING ALL THE TIME 
DON'T RUN YOU DON'T WANNA FALL OVER ON THE ROAD 
THERE WE ARE 
ALL SAFELY ACROSS 
HURRAY THEY ALL GOT THERE SAFELY 
WELL DONE HE REMEMBERED EVERYTHING WITH A LITTLE BIT OF HELP FROM US 
I BET THEY HAVE A BRILLIANT TIME PLAYING FOOTBALL YES 
IT'S FUN TO PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS EVERY DAY 
YOU WANT TO MAKE IT LAST FOREVER 
BUT KEEP IN YOUR HEAD WHAT THE TWEENIES SAID 
THEN WE'LL ALL PLAY SAFE TOGETHER 
YES WE'LL ALL PLAY SAFE TOGETHER 
ROADS ROADS ROADS ROADS 
TODAY IT'S ALL ABOUT ROADS 
ROADS ROADS ROADS ROADS 
WHAT SHOULD WE KNOW ABOUT ROADS 
TO CROSS THE ROAD AND STAY AS SAFE AS CAN BE 
YOU LISTEN WITH YOUR EARS USE YOUR EYES TO SEE 
ALL HOLD HANDS AND WHEN THE CARS HAVE GONE 
YOU CAN SAFELY CROSS 
IT'S FUN TO PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS EVERY DAY 
AND WE'LL ALL PLAY SAFE TOGETHER
