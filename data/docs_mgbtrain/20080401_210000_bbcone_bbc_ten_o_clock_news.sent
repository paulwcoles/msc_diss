TONIGHT ZIMBABWE'S OPPOSITION LEADER ISSUES AT CHALLENGE HE 
CALLS FOR THE ELECTION AUTHORITIES 
TO PUBLISH WHAT THEY KNOW 
PRESIDENT MUGABE SAYS HE IS AN 
HONEST MAN AND THAT HE DOES NOT 
BELIEVE IN CHEATING L. HOPE WHEN 
THE RESULTS ARE ANNOUNCED IT IS A 
TRUE REFLECTION OF THE VOTES 
ROBERT MUGABE A WEAKER NOW THAN 
EVER BEFORE 
THE B. B. C. HAS TWO CORRESPONDENT 
INSIDE ZIMBABWE CORRESPONDENCE 
WE HAVE GOT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL 
HERE ANYONE WHO IS SEEN WITH A 
CAMERA WILL GET ARRESTED BUT IT 
HAS TO BE SET I HAVE NOT SEEN A 
SINGLE ROAD BLOCK ON THE WAY IN AND 
THERE IS LITTLE SECURITY 
ALSO A CONTROVERSIAL FIRST FOR 
BRITISH SCIENTISTS THE FIRST 
ANIMAL HUMAN EMBRYO IS CREATED 
MIGRANT WORKERS BRING LITTLE OR NO 
ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO BRITAIN 
ACCORDING TO A PARLIAMENTARY REPORT 
BRITISH PLANS TO WITHDRAW ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
TROOPS FROM IRAQ HAD BEEN PUT ON 
HOLD I MANCHESTER UNITED WIN IN 
EUROPE 
ON B. B. C. LONDON HARRIET HARMAN IS 
CRITICISED FOR WEARING STAB PROOF 
VEST ON WALKABOUT 
AND THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS OF 
THE KENT AIR CRASH VISIT THE SITE 
GOOD EVENING BEHIND ME ZIMBABWE 
AND REFUGEES HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
THEIR RADIOS AND THE WORDS OF THE 
OPPOSITION LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
HIS EMERGENCE AFTER THREE DAYS OF 
SILENCE HAS REKINDLED HOPE OF MONK 
SUPPORT THIS YEAR AND INSIDE THE 
COUNTRY WHO THOUGHT YET ANOTHER 
ELECTION WAS BEING STOLEN FROM THEM 
AMONG SUPPORTERS HERE HE GAVE 
ELECTION ADVISERS TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO 
PUBLISH THE ELECTION RESULTS JOHN 
SIMPSON HAS MANAGED TO SEND HIS 
REPORT FROM INSIDE ZIMBABWE 
EVER SINCE SATURDAY'S ELECTION THE 
CITY HAS BEEN EMPTY AND SILENT BUT 
TODAY PEOPLE CAME FLOODING BACK AS 
NORMAL LIFE RESUMED IMMEDIATELY 
THE RUMOURS STARTED A DEAL HAD 
BEEN STRUCK WHEREBY ROBERT MUGABE 
WOULD STEP DOWN HE WOULDN'T ANSWER 
TONIGHT THE OPPOSITION WOULD TAKE 
OVER HE WOULD ANNOUNCE IT 
TONIGHT ALL WISHFUL THINKING 
PEOPLE HERE ARE DESPERATE FOR 
CHANGE CHANGE THE WINDOW FOR CHANGE HAS ARRIVED 
IN THIS COUNTRY ZANU P. F. WHETHER 
THEY ARE GOING TO RIG THE ELECTIONS 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WIN 
THE LABORIOUS BUSINESS OF DAILY 
LIFE HERE THE ENDLESS QUEUEING 
THE WAITING FOR ANY CHANCE TO EARN 
CASH IN A COUNTRY WHERE ONLY ONE 
ADULT IN FIVE HAS A JOB YOU CAN 
SEE THAT THINGS ARE GETTING BACK TO 
SOMETHING LIKE NORMALITY THEY'RE 
QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE STREET 
THEIR CARS AROUND THERE ARE 
THIS COMES AFTER THREE DAYS IN 
WHICH PEOPLE HAVE STAYED AT HOME 
THERE HAVE BEEN VERY FEW CARS IN 
THE STREET WE HAVE TO BE REALLY 
CAREFUL HERE ANYONE SEEN WITH A 
CAMERA WILL GET ARRESTED BUT IT 
HAS TO BE SET I HAVE NOT SEEN A 
SINGLE ROADBLOCK ON AWAY HINT AND 
THERE IS VERY LITTLE SECURITY 
ON THE WAY IN THIS WAS THE LAST 
TIME ROBERT MUGABE WAS SEEN IN 
PUBLIC ON SATURDAY RUMOURS SAY HE 
IS IN SOUTH AFRICA NEGOTIATING HIS 
RESIGNATION THAT HAS BEEN DENIED 
THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE HAS ONE VERY 
POWERFUL WEAPON IT IS HIGHLY 
LIKELY THAT ITS PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATE MORGAN TSVANGIRAI AS 
WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE VOLZ THAN 
THE ROBERT MUGABE VOTES THOUGH 
WHETHER THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT 
CONTROLLED TALLY SHOWS THAT HE IS 
STILL NOT CLEAR 
WE HAVE TO WAIT AS YOU ARE ALL 
WAITING PRESIDENT MUGABE SAYS HE 
IS AN HONEST AND AN HONEST MAN 
AND HE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN CHEATING 
I HOPE WHEN THE RESULT IS ANNOUNCED 
IT IS THE TRUE REFLECTION OF THE 
BOLT MACRO AND THAT THERE IS NO 
REASON TO INVOLVE A FRAUDULENT 
ACTIVITIES VOTE THE PEOPLE OF 
ZIMBABWE HAVE WAITED FOR THIS LONG 
I THINK THEY CAN WAIT FAR LONGER TO 
REACH THAT CONFIRMATION I AM 
PREPARED TO WAIT AS LONG AS IT 
TAKES TAKES PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY 
HERE SAID THAT UNLESS THERE IS A 
CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT THE ECONOMY 
WILL SIMPLY COLLAPSE IT IS BAD 
ENOUGH ALREADY INFLATION IS 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PER CENT I WAS HERE IN JANUARY 
AND A LOAF OF BREAD COST MILLION 
A MILLION ZIMBABWE AND DOLLARS NOW 
IT COSTS EIGHT MILLION THIS COUNTRY IS 
IN A STATE OF CHRONIC FAILURE ONLY 
POLITICAL CHANGE IT SEEMS CAN 
RESCUE IT 
ROBERT MUGABE'S POWER HAS ALWAYS 
RESTED ON HIS LEADERSHIP OF THE 
GUERRILLA WAR THAT BROUGHT ABOUT 
INDEPENDENCE IN THAT COUNTRY BUT 
TODAY EVEN MOST OF EVEN SOME OF 
HIS MOST ARDENT SUPPORTERS WANT HIM 
TO GOLF WAR VETERANS HAVE BEEN 
TELLING THE B. B. C.'S IAN PANNELL THAT 
IT IS TIME FOR CHANGE 
THREE DAYS OF WAITING AND STILL NO 
CLEAR SIGN OF WHO WILL RUN ZIMBABWE 
IN THE FUTURE THEY HAVE WAITED 
YEARS FOR CHANGE NOW THEY MUST 
WAIT A LITTLE LONGER WHAT THE 
RESULTS ARE SLOWLY DRIP FED TO 
PEOPLE DESPERATE FOR CHANGE 
OUR MAJOR WORRY IS THAT THE DELAYS 
IN ANNOUNCING ITS RESULTS IS A 
CLEAR DEMONSTRATION THAT THESE 
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING 
THEY ARE TRYING TO COOK UP THE 
RESULT THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE WILL 
NOT ALLOW ZANU P. F. TO STEAL THE 
ELECTION AND THE MORE 
SOME SECURITY FORCES HAVE BEEN SEEN 
ON THE STREETS SO FAR THEY HAVE 
KEPT A LOW PROFILE AND THINGS HAVE 
BEEN CALM PEOPLE HOPE FOR A 
PEACEFUL CHANGE BUT THEY FEAR IT 
MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE THIS IS WHERE 
ROBERT MUGABE SOWED THE SEEDS OF 
HIS COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC DOWNFALL IN 
THE ONCE FERTILE FIELDS OF ZIMBABWE 
A DISASTROUS LAND REFORM PROGRAMME 
CONFISCATED WHITE OWNED FARMS AND 
GIVE IT TO MEN WITHOUT THE TOOLS 
ARE THE SKILLS TO TILL THE LAND 
THIS IS MUGABE COUNTRY THESE 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THE BEDROCK OF HIS 
SUPPORT IN THE PAST BUT THIS TIME 
AT THINGS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN 
DIFFERENT DIFFERENT I WANT TO TRY SOMEONE ELSE 
BG VAUX ZANU P. F. IN THE PAST 
YES YES ONE LOOK IN THE LOCAL SHOP AND YOU 
CAN SEE WHY DUSTY SHELVES WITH A 
FEW BARS OF SOAP AND THE ODD PACKET 
OF TEA NO FOOD NO JOBS AND NO 
MONEY THE COUNTRY IS STILL WAITING 
TO KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS 
WE CAN'T TALK NOW TO JOHN SIMPSON 
WHO IS IN SIGHT ZIMBABWE WE CAN 
HIS MORGAN TSVANGIRAI TAKING ANY 
SORT OF RISK IN THE ISSUING THIS 
CHALLENGE TO EFFECTIVELY PUBLISH OR 
BE DAMNED 
OF COURSE PUBLICATION IS WHAT 
SIMPLY HAS NOT HAPPENED WE HAVE 
HAD THE RESULTS NOW PRESUMABLY IN 
BALLOT BOX FORM FOR THREE DAYS 
YET NOBODY SEEMS TO HAVE STARTED 
PROBABLY COUNTING THE VOTES FOR THE 
PRESIDENCY HE IS RIGHT TO DO THAT 
EVERYBODY WANTS HIM TO DO IT THE 
FACT IS THAT ONE LEADING 
INDEPENDENT OUTFIT HERE ESTIMATES 
THAT HE HAS WON FIFTY ONE PER CENT OF THE BULK 
WHICH IS JUST IN OFF TO MEAN THAT 
HE DOES NOT HAVE TO UNDERGO A RUN 
OFF WITH MUGABE VOTE WHETHER 
OF COURSE WE ARE GOING TO SEE ANY 
SUCH RESULTS AFTER ALL IT IS 
STILL IN THE HANDS OF PRESIDENT 
MUGABE I SUSPECT IF THERE ARE 
TALKS GOING ON THOSE TALKS ARE 
ABOUT WHETHER HE IS GOING TO ALLOW 
THE VOTE TO BE PUBLISHED OR WHETHER 
HE WILL A MASS AS THEM AGAIN 
MASS WE SAW THE TWO MANAGED TO 
GET OUT DESPITE THE RESTRICTIONS 
AND DIFFICULTIES YOU DO SENSE THAT 
CHANGE IN PUBLIC MOOD 
YES I FELT ONE THE DIFFICULTIES 
ARE WITHOUT QUESTION I HAVE TO SAY 
THERE IS AT TOTAL BLACKOUT 
CERTAINLY IN THIS HALL PART OF 
HARARE WHERE I AM AT THE MOMENT 
IN THIS ENTIRE PART OF HARARE L. AM 
SURROUNDED BY COLLEAGUES OF MINE 
WHO ARE JUST SHINING TORCHES ON ME 
IN THE DARKNESS THERE IS I THINK 
A CHANGE IN ATTITUDES I DO NOT 
THINK IT WILL BE VERY EASY THIS 
TIME FOR PRESIDENT MUGABE TO SAY I 
HAD WON THE VOTE I'M NOT GOING TO 
TELL YOU HOW I HAVE DONE IT BUT I 
HAVE WON IT L. DO NOT THINK PEOPLE 
WOULD STAND FOR THAT WHETHER IT 
MEANS THEY WILL COME OUT ONTO THE 
STREETS AND PROTEST OR WHETHER THEY 
WILL SIMPLY WHAT I WILL SUSPECT 
WILL HAPPEN THEY WILL SIMPLY GO 
QUIET AND NOT TURN UP TO THEIR JOBS 
AND DO WHAT IN FACT PEOPLE WERE 
DOING OVER THE LAST THREE OR FOUR 
DAYS JUST STAYING AWAY QUIETLY WE 
WILL HAVE TO SEE WHETHER THAT 
HAPPENS BUT I THINK THAT MAYBE ONE 
POSSIBILITY POSSIBILITY INDEED THAT IS ALL FROM THE FOR 
THE MOMENT BACK TO LONDON 
SCIENTISTS AT NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY 
HAVE BECOME THE FIRST IN BRITAIN TO 
CREATE PARK HUMAN PARK ANIMAL 
EMBRYOS PART HUMAN PARKS ANIMAL 
THE WORK IS HUGELY CONTROVERSIAL 
THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH IN 
PARTICULAR HAS BEEN VERY CRITICAL 
THESE ARE HYBRID EMBRYOS UNDER THE 
MICROSCOPE HALF HUMAN HALF ANIMAL 
EACH SMALLER THAN A PINHEAD THEY 
WERE CREATED IN HIS LAB AT 
NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY PART OF 
RESEARCH INTO DISEASES LIKE 
PARKINSON'S AND DIABETES THESE 
DISHES CONTAIN SEVERAL HYBRID 
EMBRYOS WHICH SURVIVED FOR THREE 
DAYS SCIENTISTS STRESS THEY WOULD 
NEVER IN PLANT THESE INTO A WOMAN 
THEY ARE PURELY FOR LABORATORY 
RESEARCH THE REASON THEY USED COW 
EGGS IS BECAUSE HUMAN ONES ARE SUCH 
AS SCARCE AND PRECIOUS RESOURCE 
THE TECHNIQUE INVOLVES REMOVING THE 
GENETIC MATERIAL FROM A COW'S EGG 
AND INSERTING HUMAN D. N. A. A HYBRID 
EMBRYO IS NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE PER CENT HUMAN AND NOT OH ONE 
PER CENT CAL THE SCIENTISTS HOPE TO GROW 
THEM FOR SIX DAYS AND THEN EXPECT 
STEM CELLS FROM INSIDE WHICH CAN 
TURN INTO ANY KIND OF TISSUE 
IF YOU LOOK DOWN THE MICROSCOPE IT 
LOOKS LIKE SEMOLINA IT STAYS LIKE 
THAT BUT IT GIVES US THE TOOLS TO 
FIND OUT THE SIMPLE QUESTIONS HOW 
CAN WE BETTER UNDERSTAND THE 
DISEASE PROCESS IS BY WORKING IN 
THOSE WITH THOSE CELLS 
THE PRIME MINISTER'S SUPPORT THE 
RESEARCH BUT HAS PROMISED M. P.'S A 
FREE VOTE NEXT MONTH ON WHETHER IT 
SHOULD BE BANNED FOR CRITICS 
HYBRIDS ARE ON ETHICAL 
IT IS BAD SCIENCE BECAUSE THESE 
EMBRYOS ARE GOING TO BE TOTALLY 
GENETICALLY CONFUSED AND AND WILL 
NOT BE HIT NORMALLY WOULD NOT 
PRODUCE NORMAL STEM CELLS AND ARE 
UNLIKELY TO GIVE THE SCIENTISTS ANY 
USED BY INFORMATION 
KAREN MCDONALD HAS MUSCULAR 
DYSTROPHY DURING CHILD THAT SHE 
HAS LOST THE ABILITY TO WALK FOR 
HER FATHER THE WORK ON HYBRIDS 
OFFERS THE CHANCE OF A BREAKTHROUGH 
IT LOOKS LIKE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY 
THAT COULD BE THWARTED IT COULD BE 
DELAYED AND WHEN YOU HAVE A 
DAUGHTER WITH A PROGRESSIVE 
CONDITION YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AL 
CURE IN A REASONABLE TIME FRAME 
EVERY YEAR THAT PASSES HER 
CONDITION IS GETTING WORSE 
RESEARCHERS BELIEVE HYBRID EMBRYOS 
COULD UNLOCK THE SECRETS BUT FOR 
THE MOMENT THIS IS FRANKENSTEIN 
SCIENCE WHICH MUTTS BIG WHICH 
MUST BE STOPPED 
MIGRANT WORKERS BRING LITTLE 
OVERALL BENEFIT TO THE BRITISH 
ECONOMY ACCORDING TO THE NEW 
PARLIAMENTARY REPORT BUT THE PRIME 
MINISTER CLAIMED AGAIN TODAY THAT 
IMMIGRATION IS NEEDED THE 
PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE SAYS THIS 
CASE IS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED THEY 
INSIST HIGH NUMBERS OF MIGRANTS 
HAVE DAMAGED THE PROSPECTS OF YOUNG 
BRITISH WORKERS 
IMMIGRATION HAS MADE PLACES LIKE 
SLOUGH A LOT BIGGER THAN THERE WERE 
A FEW YEARS AGO IT HAS GIVEN THEM 
A A FEW NEW SHOPS BUT HAS IT 
MADE THE PEOPLE AROUND HERE AND THE 
RICHER THE LORDS REPORT SAYS 
MAYBE NOT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS 
IMMIGRANTS BOOSTED THE ECONOMY BY 
SIX BILLION IN TWO THOUSAND SIX BUT THERE IS NO 
EVIDENCE THEY HAD MUTTERED AN 
IMPACT ON LIVING STANDARDS DESPITE 
MUCH OF AN IMPACT 
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THE 
INCREASE IN G. D. P. PER CAPITA HAS BEEN 
PRECIOUS LITTLE IF ANY AT ALL 
HER YOU'RE AFFECTED DEPENDS ON THE 
WIRE THE AVERAGE FAMILY IS 
PROBABLY MARGINALLY BETTER OFF FOR 
HAVING ALL WAS EXTRA WORKERS AROUND 
SO HOW MANY EMPLOYERS THIS ONE 
MAKES CARTRIDGES IN LINCOLNSHIRE 
PROBABLY WITHOUT THE INFLUX OF THE 
HIM A GOOD WORKERS THAT WE HAVE 
BEEN ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM FOR US TO STAY 
MANUFACTURING IN THIS COUNTRY 
IMMIGRANTS HAVE PROBABLY HELPED TO 
KEEP THE LID ON INFLATION THAT IS 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE KEPT A LID ON 
WAGES TWELVE PER CENT OF THE WORKING 
POPULATION ARE NOW IMMIGRANTS 
ACCORDING TO ONE STUDY EVERY TIME 
THAT SHARE GOES UP BY ONE PER CENT PEOPLE AT 
THE TOP OF THE INCOME SCALE SEE 
THEIR WAGES INCREASED BY OH FOUR PER CENT 
PEOPLE AT THE BOTTOM ARE HIT BY THE 
COMPETITION THEIR WAGES GO DOWN BY 
ABOUT HALF A PER CENT THE REPORT THINGS 
YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE LOST OUT AS WELL 
EMPLOYERS HAVE LESS REASON TO TRAIN 
THEM UP IMMIGRANTS PAY TAXES MORE 
THAN THEY CLAIM IN BENEFITS BUT 
LIKE THIS THAT THE IN FAMILY THEY 
ALSO ADD TO THE PRESSURE ON LOCAL 
SCHOOLS DOCTORS AND TRANSPORT 
LATVIAN LATVIAN WE WORK FOR THE MINIMUM WAGE WE 
FEEL QUITE RIGHT TO USE PUBLIC 
SERVICES WE PAY OUR TAXES AND 
INSURANCES INSURANCES THEY HAVE ALSO DONE THEIR BIT FOR 
PROPERTY PRICES HAVING JUST BOUGHT 
A HOUSE 
ONE FORECAST RECKONS IT IMMIGRATION 
CARRIES ON AT THE SAME RATE HAS 
PRICES WILL BE TEN PER CENT HIGHER THAN 
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN TWENTY YEARS 
THAT IS ON THE GROWTH OF HALF A 
PERCENTAGE PER YEAR ONLY THE 
PRIME MINISTER TODAY SAID MIGRANTS 
BROUGHT CLEAR BENEFITS AND REJECTED 
THE COMMITTEE'S CALL FOR A CAP ON 
THE NUMBERS COMING IN 
MANY OF THESE MIGRANTS ARE AT TODAY 
THE HIGHLY SKILLED WORKERS THAT 
HELP WAS FILL VACANCIES THAT EXIST 
IN THE ECONOMY THERE ARE IMPORTANT 
TO THE ECONOMY 
IT IS HARD TO WEIGH THE PROS AND 
CONS WHEN EVEN THE GOVERNMENT 
FIGURES ARE MORE OF A GUESS WE DO 
NOT EVEN KNOW HOW MANY IMMIGRANTS 
THERE ARE WHERE YOU STAND ON 
IMMIGRATION THEY WILL BE PANNED ON 
WHICH PART OF THE ECONOMY YOU'RE IN 
MAY WELL DEPEND 
BRITAIN'S BIGGEST TEACHERS' UNION 
THE NUT AS WELL BE TO STRIKE ON 
TWENTY FOURTH APRIL A ONE DAY STOPPAGE WILL 
AFFECT ENGLAND AND WALES IT IS THE 
FIRST ON THE SCALE FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS 
THEY ARE DEMANDING A FOUR PER CENT PAY RISE 
THIS YEAR ITS MEMBERS ARE TIRED OF 
BELOW INFLATION DEALS THEY ARE SET 
TO RECEIVE TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE PER CENT THIS YEAR 
PLANS TO WITHDRAW MORE BRITISH 
TROOPS FROM IRAQ HAD BEEN PUT ON 
HOLD DES BROWNE DEFENCE SECRETARY 
TOLD M. P.'S THIS WAS THE RIGHT 
DECISION BECAUSE OF THE SECURITY 
SITUATION IN BASRA LAST YEAR THE 
PRIME MINISTER SUGGESTED THAT TROOP 
NUMBERS MAY BE REDUCED BY TWO AND 
A HALF ONE THOUSAND BY THIS SPRING 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS IN IRAQ HAVE 
ONCE AGAIN BEING CONFOUNDED BY 
UNPALATABLE AND INCONVENIENT 
REALITIES ON THE GROUND IN BASRA 
THIS IRAQI ARMY VEHICLE AND WEAPONS 
WERE HANDED OVER TO THE MILITIAS 
APPARENTLY WITHOUT A STRUGGLE THE 
GUNMEN WERE TRIUMPHANT BUT HIS 
PLANS TO DRAW DOWN ARE ON HOLD 
IN THE LIGHT OF THE LAST WEEK'S 
EVENTS HOWEVER IT IS PRUDENT WE 
PAUSE ANY FURTHER REDUCTIONS WILL 
BE CURRENT SITUATION IS UNFOLDING 
IT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT 
MILITARY COMMANDERS REVIEW PLANS 
WHEN CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND 
CHANGE CHANGE WHEN GORDON BROWN VISITED IN 
OCTOBER HE HAD HIGH HOPES THERE 
WOULD BE AT COURT IN TROOPS BY NOW 
IT WAS TO BE A DECISIVE BREAK 
CUT MACRO THE PRIME MINISTER IS 
JUST AS STUCK IN IRAQ AS HIS 
PREDECESSOR EVER WAS 
I HOPE THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOW 
LEARNT NOT TO PLAY PARTY POLITICS 
WITH PROJECTED TROOP NUMBERS THAT 
THE PRIME MINISTER'S PERFORMANCE 
LAST OCTOBER REFLECTS BADLY ON HIM 
DOES LITTLE TO HELP THE FAMILIES OF 
THOSE WHO WILL BE SEPARATED LONGER 
THAN THE PRIME MINISTER LED THEM TO 
BELIEVE BELIEVE IRAQ COALITION IS MAINLY NOW AN 
ANGLO AMERICAN AFFAIR THE IRAQ 
COALITION 
THE RAUL THE BRITISH TROOPS IS 
KNOWN AS OVER WHAT SOME IN THE 
UNITED STATES QUESTION IF THEY ARE 
DOING ENOUGH OVER WATCH 
THE BRITISH LOST CONTROL OF BASS 
ROCK BASRA NOW THEY HAVE MOVED 
BACK TO THE AIRPORT THERE ARE 
THERE AS A TALKING POINT FOR THE 
UNITED STATES MORE THAN THEIR HOUR 
HAS AN EFFECTIVE CONTRIBUTOR TO 
IRAQI SECURITY 
THE ERROR THE EXIT STRATEGY FOR 
THESE TROOPS HAS RECEIVED A SETBACK 
IN RECENT DAYS WHAT IS IN EFFECT A 
VICTORY FOR IRAQ A RAG TAG 
COLLECTION OF MILITIAS HAS ALREADY 
BEEN ENOUGH TO REVERSE THE PLANNED 
U. K. TO CUT THE QUESTION NOW IF THE 
IRAQI ARMY TRIES AGAIN AND FAILS TO 
SEDUCE THE MILITIAS WILL BRITISH 
TROOPS BEFORE ASKED TO GO BACK INTO 
BASRA REDUCED 
PAUL BURRELL WHO SERVED AS BUTLER 
TO DIANA PRINCESS OF WALES DID NOT 
TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH AT THE INQUEST 
INTO HER DEATH THAT IS THE VIEW OF 
THE CORONER LORD JUSTICE SCOTT 
BAKER WHO HAS BEEN SUMMING UP FOR 
A SECOND DAY HE DESCRIBED MR. 
BURRELL'S BEHAVIOUR AS PRETTY 
SHABBY HE WAS JUST ONE OF NEARLY 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY WITNESSES DEBT IS EVIDENCE AND 
HIS BEHAVIOUR HAVE ATTRACTED 
CONSIDERABLE CRITICISM YESTERDAY 
THE CORONER SAID PAUL BURRELL HAD 
LIED IN THE WITNESS BOX TODAY HE 
ADDED FURTHER COMMENTS LORD 
JUSTICE SCOTT BAKER SAID 
PAUL BURRELL'S BEHAVIOUR THE 
CORONER ADDED HAD BEEN PRETTY 
SHABBY AND HIS EVIDENCE SHOULD BE 
TREATED WITH CAUTION THE CORONER 
HAS ALSO DEALT WITH THE CENTRAL 
ISSUE OF HENRI PAUL AND ALCOHOL HE 
SAID THE MAN WHO DROVE THE MERCEDES 
WAS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN SERVED TWO 
LARGE MEASURES OF ALCOHOL AT THE 
RITZ BAR THE EQUIVALENT OF FOUR 
SINGLE WHISKIES WHAT IS CLEAR IS 
THAT STAFF AT THE RITZ KNEW HENRI 
PAUL HAD BEEN DRINKING BEFORE HE 
DROVE THAT NIGHT LORD JUSTICE 
SCOTT BAKER SAID IT WAS UNFORTUNATE 
THAT THE FRENCH PATHOLOGISTS WHO 
CARRIED OUT THE FIRST POST MORTEM 
ON HENRI PAUL HAD REFUSED TO GIVE 
EVIDENCE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT 
THE BLOOD SAMPLES ONE ASPECT OF 
THE TOXICOLOGY AN ABNORMALLY HIGH 
CARBON MONOXIDE READING REMAINED A 
MYSTERY TURNING TO THE CRASH 
ITSELF THE CORONER SAID WITNESSES 
IN THE ALMA TUNNEL RANGED FROM THE 
PATENTLY HONEST TO THOSE WHOSE 
EVIDENCE WAS WORTHLESS LORD 
JUSTICE SCOTT BAKER IS EXPECTED TO 
COMPLETE HIS SUMMING UP LATE 
TOMORROW MORNING THEN THE JURY 
WILL RETIRE TO CONSIDER ITS 
VERDICTS THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE 
OF COMMONS MICHAEL MARTIN IS 
GOING TO BE INVESTIGATED BY THE 
PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONER FOR 
STANDARDS JOHN LYON WILL CONSIDER 
WHETHER ANY RULES WERE BROKEN WHEN 
THE SPEAKER'S WIFE SPENT MORE THAN 
FOUR THOUSAND OF PUBLIC MONEY ON TAXIS 
MICHAEL MARTON SPEAKER OF THE 
HOUSE OF COMMONS GUARDIAN OF 
PARLIAMENTARY DISCIPLINE AND THE 
MAN IN CHARGE OF REFORMING M. P.'S 
EXPENSIVE BUT TONIGHT HE IS UNDER 
INVESTIGATION HIMSELF HE IS FACING 
QUESTIONS ABOUT EXPENSES CLAIMS NOT 
BY HIM BUT BY HIS WIFE MARY LAST 
DECEMBER IT EMERGED THAT SINCE 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR MRS. MARTON HAD SPENT MORE THAN 
FOUR THOUSAND ON TAXIS AND CLAIMED THE LOT 
ON EXPENSES AT FIRST WE WERE TOLD 
SHE WAS ON OFFICIAL BUSINESS AND 
ACCOMPANIED BY A HOUSE OF COMMONS 
OFFICIAL BUT IT SOON BECAME CLEAR 
SHE WAS ACTUALLY ON SHOPPING TRIPS 
WITH HER HOUSEKEEPER IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THIS CONFUSION AT THE SPEAKER'S 
SPOKESMAN RESIGNED CLAIMING HE HAD 
BEEN MISLED BY OFFICIALS NOT 
SURPRISINGLY ALL THIS PROMPTED A 
COMPLAINT TO BE LODGED WITH THE 
PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONER FOR 
STANDARDS 
PHAROS SUGGESTIONS THAT STANDARDS MR. MARTIN MAY NOT HAVE BEEN USING 
HIS EXPENSIVE EXPENSES PROPERLY 
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO 
INVESTIGATE 
IN HIS REPLY TO THE INVESTIGATE COMPLAINT THE COMMISSIONER JOHN 
LYON SAID HE ACCEPTED THAT MRS. 
MARTIN'HIS CONDUCT MAY NOT HAVE 
BEEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE M. P. S. 
CODE OF CONDUCT AND WOULD THEREFORE 
INVESTIGATE TONIGHT THE SPEAKERS 
FRIENDS RALLIED ROUND TO IS THIS 
BECAUSE WHITE SPOTS TO QUEUE UP FOR 
THE NUMBER TOUR BUS OUTSIDE WENDY 
DOES THE SHOPPING OR CAN SHE BE 
TREATED WITH WHAT I WOULD REGARD 
THE DEFERENCE THAT SHE DESERVES L. 
THINK IT'S A LOT OF FUSS AND 
NONSENSE ABOUT NOTHING OF 
SEVEN YEARS AGO THE NEWLY ELECTED 
SPEAKER WAS DRAGGED UNCEREMONIOUSLY 
TO HIS CHAIR SUPPOSEDLY RELUCTANT 
TO TAKE OFFICE IF THE UPPER 
COMPLAINT IS UPHELD AGAINST MR. 
MARTIN HE COULD FIND HIMSELF 
RELUCTANTLY OUT OF OFFERS A LOT 
EARLIER THAN HE WANTED THE COST OF 
PRESCRIPTIONS IN SCOTLAND HAS BEEN 
CUT TODAY BUT IN ENGLAND IT HAS 
GONE UP IT MEANS THERE IS NOW A 
WIDE VARIATION ACROSS THE U. K. THE 
S. N. P. ADMINISTRATION IN EDINBURGH 
COST THE CUSTARD CUT THE COST OF 
FIVE COME UP WITH A PLAN TO ABOLISH 
IT BY TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE PRICES RISING TO 
SEVEN POINT ONE OH IN ENGLAND IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND THE COST IS SIX POINT EIGHT FIVE IN WALES 
THEY ARE ALREADY FREE AFTER 
CHARGES WERE ABOLISHED LAST YEAR 
FOOTBALL AND AS JUST UNITED ARE IN 
A STRONG POSITION TO REACH THE LAST 
ORR OF THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE THEY 
WON TWO TO ZERO AWAY TO ROMA IN THE FIRST 
LEG OF THEIR QUARTER FINAL 
THANKFULLY THIS TIME THE RIVALRY 
WAS INTENSE BUT THERE WAS NONE OF 
BEEN MUTUAL LOATHING AND VIOLENCE 
WHICH SHANE POLICE GUARD LAST 
SEASON'S ENCOUNTER BETWEEN THESE

OLYMPIC STADIUM STILL HAD THE RAW 
EDGE OF ROME'S ANCIENT COLISEUM

ROUGH TIME OF OF IT THERE 
TONIGHT CRISTIANO WAS THERE THAT

THEY HAVE BECOME PART OF A SECOND
