CHARLIE STAYT AND SUSANNA REID

SAYS THE RESCUE WORK IS ENTERING A 
CRUCIAL PHASE 
GOOD MORNING IT IS FRIDAY SIXTEENTH 
MAY MAY ALSO AHEAD DECLAN HAS NEWS OF BIG 
PROFITS EXPECTED FOR B. A. 
WE HAVE GOT SOME BIG QUESTIONS 
ABOUT WHY WHY B. A. WASN'T READY FOR 
TERMINAL FIVE THE THE AIRLINE'S TOP 
BOSS JOINS US AFTER SEVEN HUNDRED A M. 
A NEW WEBSITE SHOWS THE NOISIEST 
AREAS BUT WILL ANYTHING BE DONE TO 
DOWN THE VOLUME 
I'VE COME TO PORTSMOUTH 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE DAMBUSTERS 
THERE WILL BE A FLY PAST AT THE 
LAKE WHERE THEY PRACTISED 
A CLOUDY DAY FOR MANY TODAY WITH 
RAIN IN THE SOUTH BUT TORRENTIAL 
DOWNPOURS TO COME INTO THE SOUTH 
WEST LATER 
FIRST TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STILL THOUGHT 
TO BE TRAPPED FIVE DAYS AFTER 
CHINA'S DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKE THE 
COUNTRY'S PRESIDENT HAS FLOWN TO 
THE DISASTER ZONE TO SEE THE 
SITUATION FOR HIMSELF HE CALLED 
FOR RELIEF EFFORTS TO BE STEPPED UP 
SAYING RESCUE WORK HAS ENTERED ITS 
MOST CRUCIAL PHASE FOREIGN RESCUE 
TEAMS HAVE BEGUN ARRIVING IN 
SICHUAN PROVINCE IT IS FEARED THAT 
FIFTY THOUSAND HAVE DIED 
AMID THE DEVASTATION A MOTHER 
TENDS TO HER BABY SHE SITS BY THE 
ROADSIDE WITH OTHER WOMEN THEY 
HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO BUT THEY 
KNOW THEY ARE LUCKY TO BE ALIVE 
NURSES TREAT THE YOUNG 
IN THE AFFECTED AREAS MAKE SHIFT 
HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN SET UP BUT 
MEDICAL TEAMS HAVE BEEN OVERWHELMED 
AND EVERYTHING IS IN SHORT SUPPLY 
THIS DOCTOR SAYS THAT HER CHILD HAD 
GONE TO SCHOOL BUT SHE HAS NO IDEA 
HOW HE ISMENT 
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SOME MAIZING 
STORIES AMAZING STORIES OF 
SURVIVAL THIS MAN WAS TRAPPED 
UNDER THE REMAINS OF WHAT WAS ONCE 
A HOSPITAL IT TOOK RESCUERS TWO 
DAYS TO FREE HIM 
THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES SAY ALL THE 
AREAS AFFECTED HAVE BEEN REACHED 
IN SOME OF THE REMOTE PARTS 
ESSENTIAL AID HAS BEEN DROPPED FROM 
PLANES IT IS THE BASIC OF SUPPLIES 
THAT PEOPLE REALLY NEED 
CHINA'S PRESIDENT HU JINTAO VISITED 
SOME OF THE VICTIMS IN THE DISASTER 
AND CALLED FOR THE RELIEF EFFORTS 
TO BE STEPPED UP AN INVESTIGATION 
IS BEING STARTED INTO WHY SO MANY 
SCHOOL BUILDINGS COLLAPSED 
THE AUTHORITIES SAY THAT SIXTY THOUSAND 
PEOPLE TRAPPED AND INJURED BY THE 
QUAKE HAVE NOW BEEN RESCUED BUT IT 
IS THOUGHT AS MANY AS FIFTY THOUSAND MAY 
HAVE DIED IN THE STRONGEST 
EARTHQUAKE TO HIT CHINA IN IN FIFTY EIGHT 
YEARS 
LET'S SPEAK TO DAN GRIFFITHS WHO IS 
ON THE LINE FROM THE SICHUAN 
CAPITAL CAPITAL IS THERE STILL HOPE THAT MANY MORE 
PEOPLE CAN BE FOUND ALIVE 
WELL THE AUTHORITIES HERE SAY THAT 
THEIR TOP PRIORITY IS STILL TRYING 
TO SAVE LIVES BUT WE'RE NOW SEVENTY TWO 
HOURS AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE AND IT 
IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE ANYONE 
ELSE NOW BEING PULLED OUT OF THE 
WRECKAGE AND REALLY A LOT OF EFFORT 
NOW IS BEING FOCUSED MORE ON 
HELPING THE SURVIVORS THERE ARE 
THOUGHT TO BE MILLIONS OF THEM 
MANY OF THEM LIVING IN REFUGEE 
CAMPS THEY HAVE NO REAL ACCESS TO 
FOOD OR WATER AND THEY'RE LIVING IN 
MAKE SHIFT TENTS THE FOCUS NOW ON 
HELPING THEM TO GET THROUGH THE 
COMING DAYS AND WEEKS 
WHAT ABOUT INTERNATIONAL AID IS 
THAT STARTING TO MAKE AN IMPACT 
YES IT IS THAT'S RIGHT A LARGE 
TEAM OF JAPANESE RESCUE WORKERS 
HAVE ALREADY ARRIVED OTHER 
COUNTRIES HAVE ALSO OFFERED AID AS 
WELL AND CHINA HAS ACCEPTED SOME OF 
THAT AID TOO INCLUDING ASKING THE 
U. S. FOR SOME SATELLITE PICTURES OF 
THE WORST AFFECTED AREAS OF COURSE 
WE HAVE SEEN THE PRESIDENT HU 
JINTAO COME DOWN HERE TODAY FOR HIS 
FIRST VISIT TO THE REGION CHINA'S 
LEADERS ARE KEEN TO BE SEEN TO BE 
IN CONTROL OF THIS CRISIS BUT THIS 
IS A HUGE CHALLENGE FOR THE CHINESE 
GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT THEY HAVE ANNOUNCED AN INQUIRY INTO 
WHY SO MANY PEOPLE WERE TRAPPED IN 
SCHOOL BUILDINGS WHAT QUESTIONS 
ARE THEY ASKING DAN 
THAT'S RIGHT AND IN FACT I WAS AT 
ONE OF THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS THE 
OTHER DAY IN DUJIANGYAN IT HAD 
COLLAPSED TRAPPING AN UNKNOWN 
NUMBER OF CHILDREN INSIDE THE 
WRECKAGE ALTHOUGH PARENTS WERE 
HOPING SOME OF THEIR CHILDREN 
CHILDREN WOULD BE BROUGHT OUT ALIVE 
RESCUE WORKERS WERE JUST BRINGING 
OUT BODIES AND THERE WAS ANGER 
THERE ANGER ABOUT THE SCHOOL 
ANGER ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE 
CONSTRUCTION NOW WE DON'T KNOW FOR 
CERTAIN IF THAT IS ACTUALLY A 
FACTOR OR NOT AS YET IT IS TOO 
EARLY TO SAY BUT IT IS VERY 
INTERESTING TO SEE THAT THE 
AUTHORITIES HAVE ANNOUNCED THIS 
INQUIRY INTO WHY SO MANY SCHOOL 
BUILDINGS COLLAPSED AND THEY HAVE 
SAID IF THEY FIND ANYONE HAD USED 
POOR CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS IN THE 
BUILDING OF THOSE SCHOOLS THEY 
WILL PUNISHED 
DAN GRIFFITHS THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
EUROPE'S TOP AID OFFICIAL IS 
CONTINUING HIS VISIT TO THE WORST 
AFFECTED TRIP TO THE IRRAWADDY

TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE MAY HAVE DIED IN THE

A BONUS 
FOR BRITISH AIRWAYS AND ITS CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE IT HAS BEEN QUITE A 
FINANCIAL YEAR IT BEGAN WITH THE 
AIRLINE ADMITTING ALLEGATIONS OF 
PRICE FIXING PRICE FIXING AND ENDED WITH THIS 
I WANT TO 
SPEAK TO THE MANAGER 
THE CATASTROPHIC OPENING OF 
TERMINAL FIVE THERE AT LEAST NORMAL 
SERVICE RETURNED BUT THE BUILDING 
IS ONLY HALF FULL WITH MANY LONG 
HAUL FLIGHTS YET TO MOVE IN AND B. A. 
IS LEFT PICKING UP THE PIECES 
PASSENGER NUMBERS ARE DOWN SOME 
DISAPPEARING OFF TO RIVAL AIRLINES 
AND THEN THERE IS THE FUEL PROBLEM 
B. A. IS NOW SPENDING MORE THAN MORE 
FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND THERE IS NO SIGN OF 
THE STUFF COMING DOWN IT PUTS UP 
TICKET PRICES AND TRIES TO FIX THE 
COST OF THE FUEL IT BUYS FAR INTO 
THE FUTURE BUT SOARING FUEL PRICES 
REMAIN THE COMPANY'S BIGGEST 
CHALLENGE CHALLENGE IS IT O. K. IF I TAKE MY JACKET OFF 
WILLIE WALSH IS VERY MUCH IN THE 
SPOTLIGHT HE TOLD M. P.'S HE WAS 
PERSONALLY PREPARED TO BE HELD 
ACCOUNTABLE FOR TERMINAL FIVE YOU CAN 
ADD THAT THE NEED TO INCREASE 
PROFITS B. A. SHAREHOLDERS HAVE BEEN

JUST A SANDWICH 
INTERNATIONAL AID AGENCIES REJECTED 
CLAIMS BY BURMA'S PRIME MINISTER 
THAT THE RELIEF OPERATION IS OVER 
AND NOW HIS COUNTRY MUST SET TO 
WORK ON REBUILDING A UNITED 
NATIONS OFFICIAL DISAGREED SAYING 
MORE EFFORT MUST BE MADE TO DELIVER 
AID AID THE FOREIGN OFFICE ESTIMATES 
TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE MAY HAVE DIED LET'S 
GET THE LATEST FROM ANDREW HARDING 
IN BANGKOK FOR US 
ANDREW JUST SHED A LITTLE LIGHT ON 
THIS DISCREPANCY THAT WE HAVE ON 
THE ONE HAND WHO SAYS THE RELIEF 
OPERATION IS OVER AND THE AID 
AGENCIES WHO ARE SAYING OTHERWISE 
IT SEEMS CARELESS CLEARLY 
ACCORDING TO THE AID AGENCIES THERE 
IS A MASSIVE AMOUNT THAT NEEDS TO 
BE DONE IN TERMS OF THE IMMEDIATE 
EMERGENCY RELIEF OPERATION HAVE 
BEEN SPEAKING TO THE UN ABOUT IT 
AND THEIR SENIOR MAN WAS SAYING 
PERHAPS WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER OF 
BURMA WAS IMPLYING WE NEED TO 
CONCENTRATE NOT JUST ON THE RELIEF 
EFFORT BUT THE BUILDING WORK THE 
UN ARE SAYING THEY ARE NOT JUST 
WORKING ON EMERGENCY RELIEF THEY 
ARE LOOKING AT THE NEXT RICE 
HARVEST WHICH IN DAYS OR SO 
THEY NEED TO GET THE SEEDS IN TO 
REPLANT THE DELTA OTHERWISE BURMA 
IS GOING TO GO HUNGRY IT COULD 
SOON BECOME A RICE IMPORTER AND FOR 
THE POOR FARMERS WHO LIVE IN THE 
AREA THIS IS A CRITICAL ISSUE 
IT MUST BE FRUSTRATING THAT STILL 
NEARLY TWO EAX AFTER TWO WEEKS 
AFTER THE CYCLONER THEY ARE BE 
BAITING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND 
THEY ARE DEBATING HOW MANY DIED 
I SUSPECT IT IS A THE 
MUR M. E. E. S. AUTHORITIES ARE THE 
BURMESE AUTHORITIES ARE ARE 
STICKING TO SIXTY SIX THOUSAND 
THE FACT THAT PERHAPS THE 
INDEPENDENT EXPERTS WHO MIGHT GET A 
BETTER HANDLE ON THINGS ARE NOT 
BEING ALLOWED IN 
ANDREW WE WILL LEAVE IT THERE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
BINGE DRINKERS HOODIES AND YOBS 
JUST FEW OF THE LABELS THAT 
TEENAGERS GET BRANDED WITH NEW 
RESEARCH SUGGESTS SEVENTY PER CENT OF YOUNG 
PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE GETTING RAW DEAL DEAL NOW NEW B. B. C. B. B. C. TWO PROGRAMME 
CALLED REVEALED AIMS TO TACKLE THE 
MYTHS LET'S LOOK AT WHY DO THEY 
HATE YOU 
THIS IS THE PARK WE SPEND MOST OF 
OUR SUMMER IN FOR THE PAST COUPLE 
OF SUMMERS WE TURNED UP ONE DAY 
LAST SUMMER AND THERE IS PADLOCK 
ON THE GATE 
HAVE HAVE THEY LOCKED IT UP THEY THEY DECIDED WE WEREN'T WELCOME THEY 
FIGURED THAT WE WERE CAUSING 
TROUBLE AND DRINKING AND BEING 
ANTI SOCIAL ANTI SOCIAL WERE YOU DRINKING 
NO TWELVE O'CLOCK 
DURING THE SUMMER IN THE CENTRAL 
TOWN PARK I I MEAN I DON THINK 
EVEN IF WE WANT TODAY WE WOULD BE 
ABLE TO 
WERE YOU ROWDY TOO NOISY 
NOT US 
WE SUNBATHED ALL DAY 
A GROUP OF TWENTY IS A LOT OF PEOPLE 
CAN YOU SEE WHY SOMEONE WALKING 
THROUGH ON THEIR OWN MIGHT BE 
INTIMIDATED 
YEAH YEAH I INTIMIDATED UNDERSTAND BUT IT IS UNFAIR TO 
BLAME IT ALL ON YOUNG PEOPLE IF IT 
WAS A GROUP OF ADULTS BEFORE AND A 
YOUNG PERSON WAS WALKING THROUGH 
IT WOULD BE THE SAME BUT I DOUBT 
THE ADULTS WOULD BE ASKED TO LEAVE 
LET'S SPEAK TO ANTHONY BAXTER AND 
CLAIRE CLAIRE YOU FEEL THAT A 
TINY MINORITY ARE GIVING ALL 
TEENAGERS A BAD NAME 
YEAH I DO 
I THINK WELL I CAN ONLY SPEAK FROM 
EXPERIENCE I'M FROM NORTHERN 
IRELAND AND THERE IS LIKE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
YOUNG PEOPLE IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
AND THE WAY IT WAS PUT TO ME ONCE 
WAS THAT LAST NIGHT IT WAS REPORTED 
ON THE NEWS THAT FIVE YOUNG PEOPLE 
COMMITTED A CRIME BUT THAT STILL 
LEAVES FOUR HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THAT DIDN'T PEOPLE 
SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IT IS A SMALL 
MINORITY AND THAT IT IS NOT PEOPLE 
SHOULDN'T GENERALISE ALL YOUNG 
PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF A SMALL 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
I WONDER ABOUT THIS THOUGH DO DO 
PEOPLE NOT JUDGE WHAT THEY SEE AND 
THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES IT IS ALL 
VERY WELL THERE IS A HABIT OF 
BLAMING THE MEDIA FOR GENERAL 
PRESENTATION WHAT MOST PEOPLE DO 
IF THEY SEE SOMEONE WALKING DOWN 
THE STREET AND SEE SOMEONE THEY 
MAKE JUDGEMENT ABOUT THEM IF YOU 
FEEL SOMEONE IS DRESS INDEED 
CERTAIN WAY AND YOU MAKE JUDGEMENT 
ANOTHER PART OF TODAY'S JUDGEMENT SURVEY IS THAT AROUND FIFTY PER CENT OF 
TEENAGERS REALISE THAT THE IMAGE 
THEY HAVE GOT IS JUSTIFIED THEY 
ARE AWARE OF FACT THAT THERE ARE 
TEENAGERS OUT THERE WHO ARE DOING 
BAD THINGS IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
CRIME FIGURES THERE ARE FORTY SEVEN 
MILLION TEENAGERS IN THE K. AND IN 
U. K. AND IN TWO THOUSAND SIX LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND 
WERE INVOLVED IN COME CRIME 
WHETHER THEY WERE REPRIMANDED 
ARRESTED OR OFFENDEDED YOU HAVE 
GOT TO LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGE 
THAT'S NO MORE THAN THREE PER CENT WHY WHEN WE 
WALK DOWN THE STREET DO WE LOOK AT 
TEENAGERS AND THINK WHAT ARE THEY 
UP TO WHAT MIGHT THEY DO THE 
MEDIA HAS TO ANSWER THAT TO TO SOME 
POINT ALL THE HEADLINES ALL THE 
TIME IT HAVING SOME IMPACT 
CLAIRE DO YOU NOT THINK THAT SOME 
TEENAGERS REVEL IN THAT IMAGE YOU 
MIGHT GET GROUP OF LADS WHO ARE 
NN OF ANY INNOCENT OF ANY CRIME 
BUT THEY HANG AROUND IN HOODIES 
AND LIKE THE FEELING OF POWER THAT 
THEY GET FROM INTIMIDATING PEOPLE 
TEENAGERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR 
OWN IMAGE 
YEAH UNDOUBTEDLY 
THAT'S A VALID POINT AND THERE ARE 
A SMALL NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE AS 
WELL THAT WOULD REVEL IN THAT POWER 
AS YOU SAY AND THINK IT FUN TO PLAY 
UP TO THE IMAGE THEY THINK THEY GET 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE ARE 
THOSE THAT THERE IS NO BASIS FOR 
MOST OF THE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST 
YOUNG PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN SHOPS L. 
MEAN YOUNG PEOPLE ON AVERAGE HAVE 
TEN A WEEK TO SPEND AND SHOPS THAT 
TREAT US BADLY WE WON'T SHOP 
WHY DO YOU THINK SHOPS TREAT YOU 
BADLY 
WHAT SORT OF EXPERIENCE DO YOU 
HAVE HAVE I AM A VOLUNTEER FOR THE CHILDREN'S 
COMMISSIONER IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
WE DID A SURVEY AND WE FOUND OUT 
THAT IN THE REST OF SOCIETY THERE 
IS A PERCEPTION OF YOUNG PEOPLE 
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO SHOPLIFT 
SHOPKEEPERS ARE MORE THROWN MORE 
PRONE TO THROWING YOUNG PEOPLE OUT 
THAN ADULTS BECAUSE OF THAT 
THANK YOU BOTH FOR COMING IN 
THE MAIN STORIES WITH THE 
THOUSANDS STILL TRAPPED IN CHINA'S 
EARTHQUAKE RESCUE WORKERS ENTERING

DECLAN IS TALKING ABOUT A NEW WAY 
WE'RE GETTING OURSELVES INTO DEBT 
I WANTED TO MENTION THESE TEXTS WE 
HAVE BEEN GETTING ABOUT BRITISH 
AIRWAYS HE HAD BEEN SENDING US 
SOME GREAT TEXTS TO LOOK QUESTION 
SHOULD WILL WATTS HAVE RESIGNED OR 
TERMINAL FIVE WILLIE WALSH A 
LOT OF YOU SAY HE SHOULD NOT HE 
SHOULD STAY EXACTLY WERE HE IS 
ANDREW SAYS IT IS ABOUT BRITISH 
AIRWAYS AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS 
ANOTHER SAYS HE HAS TO LEARN FROM 
MISTAKES JENNY SAYS TERMINAL FIVE 
WAS DISAPPOINTING BUT LETTING 
WILLIE WATCH RESIGN WOULD HAVE 
MEANT FURTHER DISRUPTION WILLIE 
WALSH SHOULD HE GO OR SHOULD HE 
STAY LET US KNOW YOUR OPINION 
WILLIE WALSH JOINS US LIVE JUST 
BEFORE EIGHT A M. THERE IS LOT OF 
CONCERN IN THE PAPERS TODAY ABOUT 
PEOPLE BORROWING CASH SHORT TERM TO 
GET THEM FROM ONE PAY PACKET TO THE 
NEXT THIS IS WHEN YOU MONEY RUNS 
OUT DURING THE MONTH AND YOU ARE 
THINKING WHERE MY GETTING THE CASH 
TO PAY FOR THE PETROL OR TO PAY FOR 
THIS WEEK'S GROCERIES THE DAILY 
MAIL HAVE SLAMMED BARCLAYCARD FOR 
WRITING TO CUSTOMERS IN CURRIES IN 
AND TO DRAW MONEY ON THEIR CREDIT 
CARDS ENCOURAGING THEM IT IS 
ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE WAYS OF 
BORROWING CASH THERE ARE THINGS 
CALLED PAYDAY LOANS AND WE HURTLED 
MORE PEOPLE I GET INTO TROUBLE WITH 
THEM WE ARE TOLD THERE ARE 
SHORT TERM LOANS LASTING UNTIL YOUR 
NEXT PAY DAY THEY ARE AIMED AT 
BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN YOUR PAY 
PACKET RUNNING OUT AND YOUR NEXT 
PAY PACKET ARRIVING THEY COME WITH 
A VERY HIGH RATE OF INTEREST 
TYPICALLY THEY CHARGE TWENTY FIVE FOR 
EVERY ONE HUNDRED ADJEI BORO DESPITE THAT 
HIGH COST THEY ARE BECOMING 
INCREASINGLY POPULAR CREDIT 
AGENCIES WARNED THEY ARE SIMPLY 
SELLING THE SEAT OF TROUBLE FOR 
PEOPLE ALREADY STRUGGLING AM 
JOINED BY CHRIS FROM CREDIT ACTION 
THERE IS COMMON THEME IT IS THAT 
AT A TIME WHEN BILLS ARE RISING 
PETROL POPAT OR GOING UP GROCERY 
BILLS ARE GOING UP PEOPLE FIND 
THEIR STOCK FOR CASH YES THAT IS 
EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE SEEING 
PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING FOR THEIR 
DAY TO DAY EXPENSES HOW DO I FIND

ONE HUNDRED THESE ARE HUGELY EXPENSIVE 
YES PARTICULARLY PAYDAY LOANS M. TWENTY FIVE 
POUNDS AND EVERY ONE HUNDRED THE BORROWER 
IS ASTRONOMICAL PAYING TWENTY FIVE IS IS THERE A CHEAPER WAY

OVERDRAFT TALK TO YOUR BANK ABOUT 
A PERSONAL LOAN YOU CAN GET HELP 
AND ADVICE FROM AN ORGANISATION

INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN STARTED INTO 
WHY SO MANY SCHOOL BUILDINGS 
COLLAPSED THE AUTHORITIES SAY THAT 
SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE PEOPLE TRAPPED AND

SAID THEIR TOP PRIORITY IS STILL 
SAVING LIVES THE REALITY IS THAT

INVESTIGATION INTO WHY SO MANY 
SCHOOLS COLLAPSED THEY ARE 
PROMISING THAT ANYONE FOUND GUILTY 
OF USING POOR CONSTRUCTION 
STANDARDS WILL BE PUNISH SO CLEARLY 
THIS RESPONSE TO THOSE PARENTS

EARTHQUAKE EARTHQUAKE DAN GRIFFITHS REPORTING THANK YOU 
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES THE 
BRITISH AIRWAYS PROFIT FIGURES HAVE 
BEEN RELEASED WE CAN GO OVER TO 
DECLAN WHO IS IN THE STOCK EXCHANGE 
FOR US THIS MORNING 
DECLAN WHAT'S THE PICTURE THE THE PROFITS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED BY 
WILLIE WALSH AS OUTSTANDING 
BRITISH AIRWAYS SAYS IT MADE EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE 
MILLION IN PROFIT OVER THE COURSE 
OF THE LAST YEAR THAT'S IN THE 
TEETH OF RECORD FUEL BILLS AND 
RECORD OIL COSTS A BIG JUMP IN 
PROFITS THEY HAVE GONE UP FROM 
SIX HUNDRED ELEVEN MILLION TO EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE MILLION NOW 
B. A. THOUGH IS BEING VERY DOWNBEAT 
INDEED THIS THIS STATEMENT THAT'S 
IN FRONT OF ME ABOUT THE IMPACT OF 
HIGH OIL COSTS ON THE AIRLINE IT 
SAYS THAT IF OIL REMAINS AT ITS ITS 
CURRENT PRICE OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS A BARREL B. A.'S 
FUEL BILL WILL JUMP TO ONE BILLION 
FOR THE COURSE OF THE YEAR IT SAYS 
THAT BECAUSE OF THAT IT IS ALREADY 
TAKING ANOTHER LOOK AT THE COST OF 
RUNNING THE BUSINESS AND AT THE 
FLIGHTS THAT IT OPERATES SO B. A. 
SAYS IT IS REVIEWING ITS NETWORK 
ONCE AGAIN IN ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO 
KEEP COSTS DOWN AND IT IS WARNING 
THAT THE NEXT THREE MONTHS ARE 
GOING TO BE WHAT IT SAYS IS 
PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT SO TWO TWO 
HALVES OF A STORY COMING FROM 
BRITISH AIRWAYS A BIG JUMP IN 
PROFITS WHAT IT CALLED AN 
OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE BUT ON THE 
OTHER SIDE LOTS OF GLOOM AND 
WARNING BELLS RINGING ABOUT THE 
IMPACT OF HIGH OIL PRICES 
DECLAN FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE HEARING 
THE FIGURES THEY ARE THINKING 
ABOUT THE PROBLEMS THEY HAVE HEARD 
ABOUT DOUBLE A. HAVE IT B. A. HAVE IT HOW 
DO THESE THINGS RECONCILE 
THEMSELVES 
TERMINAL FIVE WILL FEED THEMSELVES INTO PROFIT FIGURES LIKE THIS THE 
POINT OF TERMINAL FIVE WAS TO CHANGE 
THE BAY B. A. OPERATES AND SWEEP AWAY 
THE SPANISH PRACTISES THAT JUMPED 
UP IN THE DIFFERENT TERMINALS AND 
BRING THE AIRLINE INTO ONE TERMINAL 
IN HEATHROW WITH A NEW MORE 
EFFICIENT MORE MODERN WAY OF 
WORKING THAT'S THE MANAGEMENT 
PRESSURE BEHIND THE TERMINAL FIVE 
PROJECT BUT THE AIRLINE HAS 
ALREADY ADMITTED CHARLIE THAT 
TERMINAL FIVE AND THE SCENES THE 
CHAOTIC SCENES THAT WE SAW ON THE 
OPENING DAY AND THE DELAYS THAT WE 
SAW IN THE FIRST FEW DAYS THAT 
THEY ARE GOING TO COST THE AIRLINE 
MILLIONS OF POUNDS BUT B. A.'S CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE WILLIE WALSH SAID IF 
THEY HADN'T GONE TO TERMINAL FIVE WHEN 
THEY DID IF THEY THEY WAITED UNTIL 
IT WAS IN A BETTER SHAPE THAT THAT 
WOULD HAVE COST THEM MORE 
DECLAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WILLIE WALSH WILL BE WITH DECLAN AT 
SEVEN POINT FIVE OH SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY A LOT OF COMMENT FROM PEOPLE ABOUT 
WHETHER OR NOT HE SHOULD GET 
BONUS ONE OF THE THINGS DECLAN

IN THE SAME WAY FOR ALL ENTRANCE 
THE WATCHDOG DOES INTEND TO 
INVESTIGATE ENGLAND'S ASSESSMENT 
SYSTEM SYSTEM PEOPLE IN ENGLAND CAN FIND OUT 
OFFICIALLY HOW NOISY THEIR 
NEIGHBOURHOOD IS FROM TODAY BY 
LOOKING AT NEW WEBSITE LAUNCHED 
BY THE GOVERNMENT DECIBEL LEVELS 
HAVE BEEN MEASURES TO TAKE INTO 
ACCOUNT NOISE CREATED BY TRANSPORT 
AND INDUSTRY 
IT CAN BE INCREDIBLY NOISY OUT 
THERE THERE BUT WHEN 
DO S. 
A BIT OF A DIN 
BECOME AN UNBEARABLE RACKET 
WELL THANKS TO THIS NEW NOISE MAP 
WEBSITE FROM DEFRA YOU CAN FIND 
OUT OUT FOR INSTANCE THIS PART OF 
NOTTINGHAM IF WE TYPE IN THE 
POSTCODE HAS A DECIBEL LEVEL OF SEVENTY FIVE 
D. B.'S THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF 
PHONE RINGING NEXT TO YOUR EAR BUT 
THAT'S HARDLY SURPRISING 
ANNIE NOISE CAMPAIGNERS AREN'T 
CONVINCED THEY WILL BE ABLE TO USE 
THE DATA TO GET THE VOLUME TURNED 
DOWN DOWN YOU DON HAVE TO BE THE BRAIN OF 
BRITAIN TO KNOW YOU LIVE BESIDE A A 
NOISY ROAD OR RAILWAY OR AIRPORT 
BUT THEY HAVE EXCLUDED SO MANY 
THINGS NOW KNOW FOR INSTANCE 
FOOTBALL GROUNDS WE HAVE YET TO 
FIND ONE OF THOSE ON THE NOISE MAP 
THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS ITS NOISE 
MAP WHICH TAKES IN TWENTY THREE URBAN AREAS 
IN ENGLAND EIGHTY THOUSAND KILOMETRES OF 
ROADS FIVE THOUSAND KILOMETRES T. V. RAILWAYS 
AND EIGHTEEN AIRPORTS WILL BE USEFUL 
THIS INFORMATION ISN'T AVAILABLE 
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE UNDER TAKEN THIS 
EXERCISE AND IT WILL PROVIDE THE 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO SET UP 
PRACTICAL PLANS IN WHICH WE CAN SEE 
NOISE LEVELS REDUCE 
THE MAP IS PART OF A EUROPEAN UNION 
NOISE DIRECTIVE BUT THE NEXT PHASE 
WILL BE TO CHART SOME SOME DETAIL 
ABOUT WHICH AREAS WILL BE TOLD TO 
QUITEN DOWN 
THE RESIDENTS OF CHALFORD IN 
GLOUCESTERSHIRE ARE OPTING FOR 
DONKEY POWER 
FED UP OF HAULING UP THEIR SHOPPING 
UP A STEEP HEEL THEY HAVE COME UP 
WITH AN ECOSOLUTION WHICH WON'T 
MEAN DIGGING UP THE ROADS ALEX 
BUSHILL HAS THE DETAILS 
GOOD MORNING WELCOME TO CHALFORD 
THIS IS THE ORIGINAL BEAST OF 
BURDEN THIS IS TEDDY AND THIS IS 
CHESTER CHESTER THEY HAVE THE HOPES OF AN ENTIRE 
VILLAGE RESTING ON THEIR SHOULDERS 
THE PROBLEM IS IT IS ON STEEP HILL HILL THE VILLAGERS ARE JUST FED UP WITH 
HAVING TO TAKE THEIR GROCERIES UP 
THE HILL AND THAT'S WHERE OUR FOUR 
LEGGED FRIENDS COME IN 
YOU ARE WRESTLING WITH CHESTER YOU 
ARE JUST BEING LAZY REASON YOU NO NO CHALFORD HAS A STEEP HILL AND WE 
NEED AN ANIMAL TO HELP US GET UP 
THE HILL WITH OUR SHOPPING 
A PACK ANIMAL LIKE THESE ONES THEY 
ARE NOT WELL TRAINED WHAT'S THE 
NEXT STAGE 
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO 
SLOWLY INTRODUCE THEM TO CARRYING 
WEIGHTS AND PUT BAGS ON THEM THE 
LITTLE ONE IS NOT READY TO WORK 
BECAUSE HE IS ONLY THREE 
AND THE VILLAGE BEHIND YOU 
EVERYONE IS ECSTATIC ABOUT THE 
DONKEYS ARRIVING AND THEY ARE 
LOOKING FORWARD TO THEM STARTING 
UNUSUALLY THIS IS NOT A NOVEL IDEA 
WE HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE IN IN CHALFORD IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES DONKEYS WERE 
USED FOR FOR FOR DELIVERING 
BREAD AND COAL AND OTHER ITEMS 
CHESTER WAS ABOUT TO EAT MY 
MICROPHONE MICROPHONE THEY CAN ECO FRIENDLY APART FROM A 
FEW METHANE EMISSIONS 
VERY TACTFULLY PUT ALEX 
COMING UP IN THIS HOUR WE WILL BE 
FINDING OUT WHY B. T. BOSSES SAY IT IS 
THE END OF THE BEHIND OF THE LINE 
FOR THOUSANDS OF PHONE BOXES 
WE INTRODUCED TO KATE SPALL WHO 
FOUGHT FOR HER LATHE MOTHER TO GET 
LATE MOTHER TO GET A NEW CANCER 
DRUG ALTHOUGH HER MOTHER DIED 
BEFORE SHE GOT THE DRUG 
SINCE HER APPEARANCE ON BREAKFAST 
KATE RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF E. MAILS 
AND QUERIES FROM PEOPLE NEEDING HER 
ADVICE BECAUSE OF YOUR RESPONSE 
WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD RETURN TO THE 
ISSUE LET'S HEAR FROM ONE OF THE 
PATIENTS SHE HELPED 
WHAT DO I THINK OF HER IF ANYONE 
WAS IN THIS POSITION THEY WOULD 
KNOW WHAT I THINK OF HER 
SHE GIVE US ENDLESS HOURS OF HELP 
ENDLESS BOOSTING THE UP WHEN I WAS 
DOWN L. CANNOT DESCRIBE WHAT SHE 
DONE FOR US FOR ME AND MY TWO SONS 
JUST ONE OF THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE 
HELPED YOUR MUM WAS SUFFERING FROM 
CANCER AND COULD NOT GET THE DRUGS 
THAT YOU FELT SHE NEEDED THAT COULD 
HAVE GIVEN HER AN EXTRA CHUNK OF 
TIME TIME YES ABSOLUTELY IT WAS FROM AN 
ONCOLOGIST AND TOLD US THESE WERE 
THE BEST DRUGS FOR HER YOU HAVE 
THIS HORRENDOUS SITUATION WHERE 
YOUR MUM IS DYING OF CANCER YOU'RE 
BEING TOLD THERE IS A TREATMENT 
THAT CAN HELP WORK THAT YOU CANNOT 
GET HOLD OF IT IT WAS A DIFFICULT 
SITUATION SITUATION THESE WERE LICENSED DRUGS BUT THEY 
HAVE NOT COMPLETE THE PROCESS TO 
PROVIDE THEM ON THE N. H. S. 
THAT IS RIGHT THEY HAVE BEEN 
LICENSED THROUGH THE EUROPEAN YOUNG 
EUROPEAN UNION IT IS A PROCEDURE 
WHICH SEEMS TO BE STOPPING THE 
ACCESS ACCESS THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CLINICAL 
EXCELLENCE SAYS IT TAKES LONG 
TIME FOR THEM TO DO THEIR JOB IT 
IS A LONG PROCESS OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE 
ARE GETTING IN TOUCH WITH YOU DO 
TRY TO GET PAST THIS SYSTEM 
IT CAN TAKE UP TO FIVE YEARS FOR 
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CLINICAL 
EXCELLENCE TO APPROVE A DRUG 
OBVIOUSLY I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO 
HELP PEOPLE ACCESS THESE DRUGS 
BEFORE THE APPROVAL PROCESS THE 
RESPONSE I HAVE BEEN GETTING IS 
TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUS ONE IS IT YOU DO THAT PEOPLE AND 
NOT DOING FOR THEMSELVES THERE IS 
AN APPEALS PROCESS WHAT IS IT 
YOU DO 
I SPENT A YEAR AT LEAST WORKING ON 
THIS THE BACKGROUND WAS TREMENDOUS 
IT TOOK ME AT LEAST NINE MONTHS TO 
A YEAR TO FIND OUT DID LEGALITIES 
OF IT L. WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS A 
HIDDEN PROCESS WITHIN THE N. H. S. NOT 
WHEN YOU CAN FIND EASILY OBVIOUSLY 
YOU HAVE A VULNERABLE PLACE 
PATIENT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH 
THIS BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS MANY OF 
THEM CANNOT MANAGE THAT IRON IS IN 
THE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE AN FOR 
IT WITH THEM I N. USING L. WRITE 
THEIR APPEAL FOR THEM L. CANNOT 
GIVE THAT LEVEL OF SUPPORT TO THE 
PATIENTS BUT A WELL TRIED TO GUIDE 
THEM ALL AS MUCH AS I CAN 
A NUMBER OF IN ELS A LOT OF THEM 
SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
AND NUMBER OF THEM QUESTION A 
NUMBER OF E. MAILS ONE SAYS THESE 
ARE NOT LIFE ENHANCING DRUGS HAD 
HE RESPOND TO THAT 
THE FACT THAT THE NATIONAL 
INSTITUTE OF CLINICAL EXCELLENCE 
HAVE TO RATION THESE DRUGS 
A LOT OF PEOPLE DO SAY THAT IT 
SEEMS UNFAIR AND TEA USE CANCER 
PATIENT AS A COST CUTTING EXERCISE 
YES CANCER CAN BE A TERMINAL 
ILLNESS BUT THEY DESERVE THE 
TREATMENT AS MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE 
WE'RE WORKING THROUGH CANCER 
RESEARCH TO TREATMENT THAT WILL 
MAKE THIS A MANAGEABLE DISEASE WHY 
ON EARTH CAN WE NOT ACCESS THESE 
WE ARE ONLY ASKING FOR WHAT THE 
REST OF EUROPE AND THE REST OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION THE WESTERN WORLD 
HAS L. THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR 
PATIENTS TO HAVE HOPE OBVIOUSLY IF 
THEY DO NOT HAVE THIS MEDICATION 
THEY WILL BE REFERRED TO A HOSPICE 
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IN THE WAY IS 
THAT YOU ARE IN THE LUCKY POSITION 
YOU LOOK AT THIS VERY EMOTIONALLY 
WHEN YOU HEAR THE STORY THERE WE 
HAVE JUST HEARD YOU CANNOT ARGUE 
WITH THAT BUT THE N. H. S. TRUSTS HAVE 
A DIFFICULT DECISION THEY DO NOT 
MAKE IT ON AN EMOTIONAL BASIS BE 
THEY 
ABSOLUTELY NOT 
DE YOU TAKE THEY 
LIKE THAT 
GOODNESS ME KNOW 
IT IS EASY IN WAY TO SAY WILL 
HELP EVERYONE TRIED TO APPEAL 
AGAINST IT BUT THE N. H. S. TRUST HAS A 
RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE DECISION 
AN UNPLEASANT DECISION BUT AT SOME 
POINT YOU MUST AGREE SOME OF 
THOSE DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE BY 
SOMEONE SOMEONE I ONLY WORK WITH PATIENTS THROUGH 
THEIR ONCOLOGIST THAT IS THEIR 
CANCER SPECIALIST THE PATIENT I 
WORK WITH ARE ONES WHERE THERE AND 
COLLEGES HAS COME TO THEM AND SAID 
YOU NEED THIS TREATMENT I 
RECOMMEND IN THIS BOOK FOR YOU IT 
IS A CLINICAL DECISION BEFORE I 
EVEN GET INVOLVED ONCE I AM 
INVOLVED THEY HAVE THEIR ONCOLOGIST 
ON BOARD AND I AM VERY HAPPY TO 
TAKE IT ON 
WE ARE OUT OF TIME FOR NOW WE WILL 
TALK TO YOU LATER L. KNOW LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO GET IN TOUCH WITH US

BE MADE WHO IS GOING TO WIN 
CHAPS PORTSMOUTH CHAPS PORTSMOUTH YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST THAT'S 
WHAT THEY THINK 
MORE BACON AND EGG IN AN HOUR'S 
TIME 
IF YOU ARE THINKING OF POPPING TO 
THE SHOPS TO GET A FEW DRINKS IN 
FOR THE WEEKEND AND YOU HAVE GOT 
YOUR KIDS WITH YOU YOU MAY HAVE TO 
THINK THINK AGAIN IN THE LATEST 
ATTEMPT TO CRACKDOWN ON UNDER 
TAINLG DRINKING SOME SUPERMARKETS 
ARE REFUSING TO SELL ALCOHOL TO IF 
THEY SUSPECT IT COULD BE PASSED ON 
TO CHILDREN 
DOMINIC WALKED INTO YOUR LOCAL 
SUPERMARKET WITH YOUR FIFTEEN YEAR OLD 
DAUGHTER AND HOPING TO BUY AND WHAT 
HAPPENED 
I WAS HOPING TO BUY COOL HAPPENED BEERS FOR A HOT SATURDAY NIGHT AND 
I GOT TO THE CHECKOUT AND THEY 
REFUSE TODAY SELL IT TO ME 
YOU SAID WHY THEY SAID YOU ARE 
WITH YOUR FIFTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND 
SHE HAS NO PROOF OF I. D. AND WE DON'T 
SELL TO ADULTS WHO HAVE GOT 
CHILDREN WITH THEM 
HAVE YOU BEEN IN THAT SITUATION 
BEFORE AND YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
ABSOLUTELY NOT A REAL REAL SHOCK 
TO ME L. WAS REALLY DUMBFOUNDED 
HAVE YOU PREVIOUSLY DONE THE SAME 
THING GONE IN BOUGHT ALCOHOL AND 
HAD YOUR DAUGHTER ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY THE SAME NIGHT I WENT TO ANOTHER 
SUPERMARKET AND BOUGHT THE SAME 
BEER NO PROBLEM 
A VERY COMMON SITUATION THAT YOU 
WOULD GO SHOPPING WITH YOUR 
CHILDREN BUT CAN YOU SEE THE POINT 
BEHIND THIS 
YES I CAN 
I DON'T THINK THAT SHOPS SHOULD BE 
COMPELLED TO SELL ANYTHING TO 
ANYBODY L. DON'T THINK THE B. B. C. 
SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO PUT ON A 
PARTICULAR PROGRAMME WE LIFE IN A 
FREE SOCIETY IT IS UP TO THE SHOPS 
WHETHER THEY SELL AT ANY TIME TO 
ANYBODY ANYTHING AS FAR AS 
ALCOHOL IS CONCERNED WE HAVE A 
JUVENILE UNIT WE TAKE INPATIENTS 
DOWN TO FOURTEEN NOW WHEN YOU HAVE 
HAD EXPERIENCE OF LOOKING AFTER FOURTEEN 
YEAR OLDS WHO ARE HEAVILY IN 
TROUBLE AS A RESULT OF REGULAR 
ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION THEIR PARENTS 
MUST OF KNOWN ABOUT IT 
THE COMMON SENSE MUST HAVE PART 
TO PLAY 
YES IT DOES 
THE PERSON AT THE TILL LOOKING AT 
DOM FICK WITH HIS DOMINIC WITH 
HIS SIXTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER 
WE MUST 
ALWAYS ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION 
AS FAR AS CHILDREN ARE CONCERNED 
I AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT WE LIVE IN 
FREE SOCIETY BECAUSE YOU KNOW 
FREEDOM IS PART OF BEING ABLE TO GO 
INTO SHOP AND PURCHASE ALMOST 
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO PURCHASE AND 
TO DO 
WHATEVER YOU 
WANT TO DO 
WITH 
THAT PURCHASE THERE IS 
A CIVIL 
LIBERTY SORT 
LIBERTY SORT OF UNDERLYING AIR AIR 
AREA OF 
THIS CASE 
I THINK THE SUPERMARKETS ARE BEING 
RESPONSIBLE THEY ARE SAYING WE 
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE IT TO 
THE PEOPLE ON THE TILL AT THE TIME 
TO MAKE THE DECISION BUT WE WILL 
ALWAYS BACK THEM UP IF THEIR 
DECISION IS IN THE FAVOUR OF THE 
WELFARE OF THE CHILD 
I WILL TELL 
YOU WHAT WE WON'T SELL THE STUFF 
THAT MAKES IT EASIER AND PEOPLE 
LIKE DOMINIC WON'T HAVE THIS 
EMBARRASSING SITUATION 
I DON'T KNOW HOW EMBARRASSING IT IS 
I WOULD SAY O. K. 
DOMINIC WASN'T INTENDING TO GIVE IT 
TO HIS CHILD THE MAJORITY OF 
PEOPLE WILL BE INNOCENT AND THOSE 
WHO MIGHT BE GUILTY COULD BE JUST 
LEAVE THEIR TEENAGER OUTSIDE THE 
DOOR 
I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I WILL DOOR ALWAYS ERR ON THE WELFARE OF THE 
CHILD CHILD IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS 
HAPPENING AT SUPERMARKETS 
SPECIFICALLY WAS UNDER THE 
IMPRESSION THAT MORE OF THE PROBLEM 
WAS AROUND CORNER SHOPS IS THERE 
PROBLEM IN THE SUPERMARKETS 
I DON 
THINK THERE IS A PROBLEM IN THE 
SUPERMARKETS THAN IN THE CORNER 
SHOP OR AT HOME IT COMES DOWN TO 
PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY AND HERE WE 
HAVE GOT DOMINIC WHO DOESN'T LOOK 
LIKE THE WORST PARENT EVER I WOULD 
BE HAPPY TO TRUST MEMBERS OF MY 
FAMILY TO YOUR CARE BUT WHEN WE 
ARE LOOKING AT ALCOHOL YOU GET A 
FAIR NUMBER OF TEENAGE DEATHS 
DIRECTLY RELATED TO ALCOHOL 
CONSUMPTION YOU GET BINGE DRINKING 
MOVING ON INTO CONTINUOUS DRINKING 
YOU GET CHILDREN UNCONSCIOUS THESE 
ARE THINGS THAT I SEE 
WHERE WOULD YOU STOP WITH THIS 
LINE THE ALCOHOL IS TAKEN INTO 
HOME HOMES HAVE CHILDREN IN THEM 
WOULD YOU YOU SAY YOU SHOULDN'T 
HAVE ALCOHOL IN THE HOME BECAUSE 
THERE ARE CHILDREN IN THERE AND 
THEY MIGHT BE GIVEN THE ALCOHOL NO NO I DON THINK WE SHOULD 
AT SOME 
POINT THE ADULTS ARE RESPONSIBLE 
THAT'S MY MY STARTING POSITION THAT 
ADULTS SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE DON 
THINK THAT ADULTS WHO THEMSELVES 
ARE ALCOHOLIC OR ADDICTED SHOULD 
HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR 
CHILDREN CHILDREN THAT'S A DIFFERENT SCENARIO 
MY PINT POINT IS I HAVE GOT EVERY 
RESPECT FOR TESCO'S AND FOR FOR 
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO CRACKDOWN ON 
NOT SELLING ALCOHOL TO CHILDREN L. 
BACK THEM ONE HUNDRED PER CENT THEY SHOULD 
PUBLICISE THIS POLICY AND HOPEFULLY 
BY BEING ON HERE TODAY IT WILL BE 
PUBLICISED PUBLICISED TESCO'S SAY THEY ARE DOING A LOT OF 
WORK TO STOP UNDER EIGHTEENS OF BUYING 
ALCOHOL TESCO'S SAY IT IS NOT A

THE CONTEXT OF THE VERY 
DISAPPOINTING OPENING TO TERMINAL FIVE 
I SPOKE TO THE CHAIRMAN AND TOLD 
HIM MY VIEW WAS IT WOULD BE AN 
APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO TAKE BONUS 
WAS IT YOUR DECISION ARE WERE YOU 
TOLD YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT

ISSUE THE FOCUS HAS TO BE ON 
MAKING TERMINAL FIVE AT SUCCESS WHILE 
ANOTHER WILL BE A LOT OF INTEREST 
IN WHAT I GET PAID AND WHAT I DON'T 
GET PAID I AM PLEASED TO SAY THAT 
TERMINAL FIVE IS PROGRESSING VERY WELL 
I APOLOGISE SINCERELY APOLOGISE 
SINCERELY TO ANYONE WHO SUFFERED

LOOKING AT OUR EXPERIENCE WOULD 
LEARN THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE 
WITH THE FACT WE ALLOWED DELAYS IN 
THE BUILDING PROGRAMME OF TERMINAL 
FIVE TO COMPROMISE THE SIX MONTHS 
TESTING AND FAMILIARISATION WE HAD 
PLANNED IF I COULD GO BACK AND DO 
ONE THING AGAIN I WOULD DEFINITELY 
DO THAT DIFFERENTLY ANOTHER POINT 
THAT HAS IT WAS THE WAY IN WHICH 
WE MANAGE EXPECTATIONS PEOPLE WERE

CONTINUE TO FEEL BITTERLY 
DISAPPOINTED DISAPPOINTED YOU KNOW THIS HAS DAMAGED THE BARE 
THE REPUTATION OF BRITISH AIRWAYS

THAT WE HAVE HAD OVER TWO MILLION 
PASSENGERS WHO HAD USED TERMINAL FIVE 
I AM PLEASED THAT OUR PERFORMANCE 
IN TERMINAL FIVE IS VERY SOLID WE 
HAVE ALREADY EXCEEDED MANY OF THE 
TARGET THAT WE SET FOR OURSELVES

OPERATION THERE IS CLEARLY MORE 
THAT WE WILL WANT TO DEMONSTRATE TO 
OUR CUSTOMERS YOU WILL SEE A VERY 
FOCUSED CONCENTRATE DEPTFORD BY

THAT WE WOULD DEMONSTRATE TO 
EVERYBODY THAT TERMINAL FIVE CAN BE A 
GREAT SUCCESS PEOPLE SHOULD BE 
PREPARED TO STAND UP AND ADMIT 
THINGS WHEN THEY GET THEM WRONG L. 
HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE WHO 
WERE AFRAID TO ADMIT MISTAKES E. P. I.

ALL OF THE AIRLINE'S STAFF IT IS 
QUITE A TURNAROUND FROM THE

OF IT OVERSHADOWED BY THE EVENTS AT 
TERMINAL FIVE EARLIER THIS YEAR AND 
THOSE CHAOTIC SCENES AT THE OPENING

OF BAGS LOST AS A RESULT WILLIE 
WALSH TELLS THE B. B. C. THAT HE'S 
TURNED DOWN HIS ANNUAL BONUS HE

APPROPRIATE L. SPOKE TO HIM A 
COUPLE OF MOMENTS AGO AND I ASKED 
HIM IF IT WAS HIS DECISION I I WASN'T TOLD L. HAVE A GREAT 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHAIRMAN L. 
SAID THAT I FELT IT WOULD BE 
INAPPROPRIATE HE AGREED IT IS NOT 
AN ISSUE THE FOCUS HAS TO BE ON 
MAKING T. FIVE A SUCCESS AND WHILE I

PRESSURE FOR HIM TO RESIGN FROM HIS 
JOB AT THE HEAD OF THE AIRLINE HE 
SAYS THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
FOR HIM TO DO IS TO STAY AND LEARN 
THE LESSONS PUT THEM INTO PRACTICE 
AND THEN MOVE ON HE SAYS ALREADY 
TERMINAL FIVE HAS SEEN MILLIONS OF 
PASSENGERS NOW PASS THROUGH IT ANY ANY EXPLANATION FOR HOW THEY HAVE MADE 
SO MUCH MONEY IN THE PAST YEAR BY BY KEEPING THE LID ON THEIR COSTS 
PARTICULARLY THE COSTS OF EMPLOYING 
STAFF WITHIN THE BUSINESS THAT HAS 
GONE DOWN BUT THERE IS A BIG BILL 
A BIG PRICE TAG THAT THE AIRLINE 
HAS TO PICK UP AND THAT IS THE 
RISING COST OF OIL B. A.'S FUEL BILL 
IN THE LAST YEAR UP BY ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR 
MILLION IF OIL STAYS AT ITS 
CURRENT PRICE THEN ITS FUEL BILL 
IN TOTAL WILL BE MORE THAN ONE 
BILLION BECAUSE OF THAT B. A. SAYS 
IT WILL LOOK AGAIN AT HOW EXPENSIVE 
IT IS TO RUN ITS BUSINESS AND TO 
LOOK AGAIN AT THE ROUTES THAT IT 
FLIES THE OVERHANGING SHADOW OF 
HIGH OIL PRICES MEAN THERE MIGHT BE 
FURTHER CUTS ON THE WAY AT B. A.

PEOPLE IN ENGLAND CAN FIND OUT 
OFFICIALLY HOW NOISY THEIR 
NEIGHBOURHOOD IS FROM TODAY BY 
LOOKING AT NEW WEBSITE DECIBEL 
LEVELS IN TWENTY THREE URBAN AREAS HAVE BEEN 
MEASURED TAKING INTO ACCOUNT NOISE 
CREATED BY TRANSPORT AND INDUSTRY 
IT CAN BE INCREDIBLY NOISY OUT 
THERE BUT WHEN DOES A BIT OF A DIN 
BECOME AN UNBEARABLE RACQUET WELL 
THANKS TO THIS NEW NOISE MAP 
WEBSITE RACKET WELL THANKS TO 
THIS NEW NOISE MAP YOU CAN FIND OUT 
THIS PART OF NOTTINGHAM HAS A 
DECIBEL LEVEL OF SEVENTY FIVE D. B.'S THE 
EQUIVALENT OF PHONE RINGING NEXT 
TO YOUR EAR THEN THAT IS HARDLY 
SURPRISING ANTI NOISE CAMPAIGNERS 
AREN'T CONVINCED THEY WILL BE ABLE 
TO USE THE DATA TO GET THE VOLUME 
TURNED DOWN 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE 
THE BRAIN OF BRITAIN TO KNOW THAT 
YOU LIVE BESIDE A NOISY ROAD OR A 
NOISY RAILWAY OR A NOISY AIRPORT 
THEY HAVE EXCLUDED SO MANY THINGS 
YOU KNOW FOR INSTANCE FOOTBALL 
GROUNDS WE HAVE YET TO FIND ONE OF 
THOSE ON THE NOISE MAP THE THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS ITS NOISE MAP 
WHICH TAKES IN TWENTY THREE URBAN AREAS 
EIGHTY THOUSAND KILOMETRES OF ROADS WILL BE 
USEFUL 
THIS INFORMATION IS NOT USEFUL AVAILABLE THAT IS WHY WE HAVE 
UNDERTAKEN THIS HUGE EXERCISE AND 
IT WILL PROVIDE THE LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES WHO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP 
WITH GOVERNMENT TO SET UP PRACTICAL 
PLANS IN WHICH WE CAN SEE NOISE 
LEVELS REDUCED 
THE MAPS ARE PART 
OF A EUROPEAN UNION NOISE DIRECTIVE 
BUT THE NEXT PHASE WILL BE TO CHART 
SOME DETAIL ABOUT WHICH AREAS WILL 
BE TOLD TO QUIETEN DOWN 
EXAM RESULTS CANNOT BE ABSOLUTELY 
ACCURATE FOR ALL STUDENTS ACCORDING 
TO THE NEW SCHOOL TESTING WATCHDOG 
OFQUAL'S CHAIRWOMAN SAYS IT IS 
IMPOSSIBLE FOR MARKS TO BE REWARDED 
IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY FOR ALL 
ENTRANTS HOWEVER THE WATCHDOG 
DOES INTEND TO INVESTIGATE 
ENGLAND'S ASSESSMENT SYSTEM TO IRON 
OUT AS MANY IRREGULARITIES AS 
POSSIBLE POSSIBLE THE RESIDENTS OF CHALFORD ARE 
OPTING FOR DONKEY POWER OVER 
HORSEPOWER FED UP WITH HAULING 
THEIR SHOPPING UP A STEEP HILL

SOLUTION ALEX BUSHILL HAS THE 
DETAILS DETAILS GOOD MORNING THEY ARE THE ORIGINAL 
BEASTS OF BURDEN TEDDY AND CHESTER 
THEY HAVE THE HOPES OF AN ENTIRE 
VILLAGE RESTING ON THEIR SHOULDERS

PROBLEM IS IT'S PERCHED ON A HIGH 
HILL SO HIGH THEY CAN'T GET THEIR 
CARS TO THEIR FRONT DOORS THEY ARE 
FED UP WITH CARRYING THEIR SHOPPING 
UP THE HILL LET'S MEET ANNA 
USBORNE FROM THE VILLAGE YOU ARE 
GLOUCESTERSHIRE'S ANSWER TO DOCTOR

THESE TWO DONKEYS AND THEY ARE NOT 
COMPLETELY TRAINED WHAT ARE YOU 
GOING TO DO TO GET THEM INTO SHAPE 
THEY NEED HALTER TRAINING FIRST 
THIS IS YOUNG ONE AND HE WON'T BE ABLE TO 
Y. 
ANYTHING FOR THREE 
ABLE TO CARRY ANYTHING FOR THREE YEARS 
IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME WE YEARS HAVE SEEN DONKEYS 
IN CHALFORD NO NO IN THE THIRTIES THEY USED DONKEYS TO 
DELIVE BREAD AND COAL TO PEOPLE'S 
HOUSES 
I WILL LET YOU GET ON WITH HOUSES CHESTER THERE L. HAVE TO SAY THERE 
IS ONE MORE ADVANTAGE TO THESE FINE 
FOUR LEGGED FRIENDS WHICH IS THAT 
THEY ARE VERY ECOFRIENDLY APART 
FROM A FEW METHANE EMISSIONS 
AREN'T THEY LOVELY ALWAYS CUTE 
THOSE ARE THE TOP STORIES COMING 
UP MORE FROM THE CANCER DRUGS 
CAMPAIGNER KATE SPALL HUNDREDS OF 
YOU HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH AFTER WE 
FEATURED HER STORY ABOUT HOW SHE'S 
HELPED DOZENS OF PATIENTS GET 
ACCESS TO DRUGS ON THE N. H. S. WE WILL 
BE SPEAKING TO HER AGAIN SHORTLY 
NOW MANY PARENTS MIGHT WORRY THEIR 
CHILDREN ARE TEXTING THEIR WAY TO 
ILLITERACY THOSE OF YOU TRYING TO 
PRISE YOUR CHILDREN AWAY FROM THEIR 
MOBILES COULD TAKE SOME COMFORT 
FROM RESEARCH BEING DONE IN CANADA 
TEXT TALKSHOWS AN ABILITY TO SWITCH 
BETWEEN FORMAL AND INFORMAL SPEECH 
AND THAT IN TURN HELPS 
COMMUNICATION SKILLS 
HI WOT 
UDOIN 
IT'S LIKE A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE I'M 
GLAD THERE WAS AN INTERPRETATION ON 
THAT VIDEO WELL JOINING US NOW IS 
LUCY VAN AMERONGEN THE AUTHOR OF 
THE A TO Z. OF TEEN TALK AND ALSO 
MARIE CLAIR FROM THE PLAIN ENGLISH 
CAMPAIGN GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH 
PRESUMABLY THAT COMES NATURALLY TO 
YOU DOES IT 
YES TEXT THE WHOLE TIME YES DO YOU FEEL THAT IT IS TIME HELPFUL FOR YOUR COMMUNICATION 
SKILLS OR THAT ACTUALLY YOU START 
WRITING IN THAT WAY AS WELL 
NO I 
HAVE NEVER WRITTEN IN TEXT IT'S SO 
MUCH MORE EFFICIENT AND STUFF 
TEXTING BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
TYPE OUT THE WHOLE WORD YOU PUT 
ABBREVIATIONS 
IT IS LIKE LEARNING ABBREVIATIONS A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE 
YOU CAN KIND 
OF DO YOUR OWN INTERPRETATION OF IT 
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE TEXTING AND YOU 
WANT TO SEE SEE YOU LATER THEN 
C. U. L. EIGHT E. R. ON 
OF IT I 
WOULD IMAGINE YOU ARE AGHAST 
C. U. L. EIGHT E. R. ON THE 
WOULD IMAGINE YOU ARE AGHAST AT THIS ARE YOU 
I THINK I WOULD LIKE 
TO SAY THAT WE ARE NOT ALL FUDDY 
DUDDIES AT THE PLAIN ENGLISH 
CAMPAIGN WE ARE NOT AGHAST THAT 
ANYONE WOULD USE CREATIVE LANGUAGE 
LANGUAGE IS A DEVELOPING THING 
AFTER ALL AND IT SHOULD BE ORGANIC 
BUT WHAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IS 
THE FACT THAT THIS WILL SLIP INTO 
THE WRONG DOMAIN 
TAKE ONE SPECIFIC 
WE USE THE WORD THERE THINK BUT 
IT WAS FINK DO YOU HAVE A 
PROBLEM WITH THAT 
NO PROBLEM IF 
YOU ARE TALKING AMONGST YOUR 
FRIENDS AND IT DOESN'T SLIP INTO 
YOUR C. V. THAT IS WHERE YOU ARE 
GOING TO START HAVING PROBLEMS ARE ARE YOU COMFORTABLE THAT PEOPLE COULD 
TEXT THAT ROUTINELY AND NEVER SAY 
IT AND THAT IS WHEN YOU 
IT DEVELOP VERY BAD HABITS BECAUSE IF 
YOU USE IT ONCE YOU USE IT TWICE 
IT WILL SLIP INTO OTHER USAGE AND 
WE HAVE SEEN THAT WITHIN EXAM 
ENVIRONMENTS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE 
INADVERTENTLY USED ABBREVIATED 
WORDS WRONG SPELLINGS WHEN YOU 
ARE UNDER PRESSURE 
IMAGINE AN EXAM 
SITUATION CAN YOU HONESTLY SAY YOU 
HAVE NEVER WRITTEN ANY OF THOSE 
ABBREVIATIONS OR IN FACT HAD 
LETTERS FROM FRIENDS OR NOTES WHERE 
THEY HAVE STARTED TO LET THESE 
WORDS SLIP INTO THEIR NORMAL WAY OF 
WRITING 
WHEN I REVISE ARE USUALLY HEAR IT 
OUT LOUD IT'S NOT USUALLY A 
PROBLEM FOR ME SOMETIMES RIDE 
CARS INSTEAD OF THE CARS BECAUSE 
ENGLISH TEACHERS WOULD BE APPALLED 
IF THAT STARTS TO SLIP IN 
THAT IS 
THE GREATEST WORRY BECAUSE THAT 
WILL THEN DEVELOPED INTO THE REAL 
CONCERN THEN WE WILL BE ASKED AND 
WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE WHERE 
DOES THAT LEAD TO UNLESS YOU HAVE 
A VERY STABLE CORE OF LANGUAGE THAT 
IS UNIVERSALLY UNDERSTOOD AND 
ACCEPTED AND IT HERE TO APPEARED 
YOU ARE VERY WELL SPOKEN YOU HAVE 
A GOOD USE OF LANGUAGE YOU HAVE 
PROVED THAT YOU CAN DO THESE TWO 
THINGS THERE THE PROBLEM IS WHAT 
IS HAPPENING WITH OTHER PEOPLE 
ISN'T IT 
IT IS WHEN YOU ARE 
LOOKING AT A YOUNG GENERATION THAT 
HAS BEEN INTO A TEXT WORLD WHERE 
THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
ESTABLISH THOSE BASICS OF GRAMMAR 
AND SPELLING THEIR FIRST 
EXPERIENCE IS L. O. L. LAUGH OUT LOUD 
IT CAN MEAN LAUGH OUT LOUD OR LOTS 
OF LOVE 
HOW MUCH TIME YOU THINK 
YOU SPEND TEXTING A DAY FOR I 
SPEND A LOT OF TIME TEXTING TO KEEP 
IN TOUCH WITH OLD FRIENDS 
JUST TO 
LET PEOPLE KNOW WHAT I'M DOING IN 
A NORMAL HOUR HOW MANY TEXT MY YOU 
SEND IT VARIES IF SOMEONE TEXTS 
YOU THEN YOU WILL HAVE A TEXT 
CONVERSATION AND SEND IT BACK WHEN WHEN YOU ARE TEXTING DO YOU ABBREVIATE 
THINGS WILL WRITE THEM OUT IN FULL 
I AM GUILTY THE FOUNDER OF PLAIN 
ENGLISH CAMPAIGN IS A WONDERFUL 
TEXT OF SHE COMMUNICATES VERY 
QUICKLY WITH TEXTING BUT THERE IS 
THAT NEED TO BE AWARE WHEN YOU'RE 
DOING IT IN THE WRONG PLACE IT'S 
NOT ABOUT LET'S FORGET ABOUT 
TEXTING ALTOGETHER IT'S GREAT FUN 
ANYTHING THAT HELPS PEOPLE 
COMMUNICATE TO BE ENCOURAGED BUT IN 
THE RIGHT PLACE 
TEXTING WAS ONLY 
INVENTED ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO SO IF 
WE INTRODUCED FOR WORDS INTO 
TEXTING SAY WE DON'T WANT TO GET 
RID OF TEXTING IF YOU INTRODUCE 
LONG WORDS INTO WHICH IT WILL 
CONFUSE PEOPLE 
A YOU GOT USED TO 
THE LANGUAGE ALREADY 
THAT MAKES ME FEEL SO OLD COMING 
UP HOLDING OUT FOR A HERO NEIL 
OLIVER WILL BE HERE TO TELL US HOW 
HE IS HOPING TO TURN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
BOYS INTO REAL MEN THE WEB CASTING 
WONDER RETURNS SANDY TOM WILL BE 
HERE TO TELL US HOW SHE IS NOW 
DANCING TO THE DEVILS BEAT IN A 
COUPLE OF HOURS' TIME A LANCASTER 
BOMBER WILL COME SWEEPING DOWN THE 
DERWENT VALLEY IN DERBYSHIRE TO 
MARK THE SIXTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
DAMBUSTERS RAID WE WILL BE LOOKING 
BACK AT SOME OF THE ARCHIVES OF 
WHAT HAPPENED THEN AND LOOKING 
AHEAD TO EVENTS TODAY 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE WEATHER 
THERE IS A BIT OF CLOUD AROUND IN 
DERBYSHIRE AND QUITE A LOT OF CLOUD 
AROUND AT THE MOMENT FOR SOME OF 
US WE WILL SEE SOME SUNSHINE AS 
WELL AS CLOUD THERE IS A LOT OF 
RAIN THE NET OFFERS HAVE A SEVERE 
WEATHER WARNING OUT FOR HEAVY RAIN 
YET TO COME INTO THE SOUTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND IT'S GOING TO BE SLOW 
MOVING AND THUNDERY AND WILL BE 
WITH US FOR A LARGE CHUNK OF TODAY 
YOU CAN SEE HOW ANOTHER BAND OF 
RAIN DEVELOPED IN THE LAST TWELVE HOURS 
ACROSS WALES THE MIDLANDS AND IN 
THROUGH EAST ANGLIA BY NINE AM WE 
WILL STILL HAVE SOME RAIN ACROSS 
EAST ANGLIA PATCHY AND BECOMING 
MORE FRAGMENTED THROUGH THE MORNING 
A BRIGHT START TO THE DAY THE 
CLOUD IS FIGURE IN THE NORTH EAST 
OF ENGLAND PRODUCING BITS OF 
DRIZZLE IN THE NORTH WEST IT 
SHOULD BRIGHTEN UP THIS MORNING IN 
SCOTLAND WE SHOULD SEE SOME 
SUNSHINE BUT WHERE WE HAVE THE 
CLOUD IT COULD BE FIT ENOUGH FOR 
THE ODD SHOWER A GORGEOUS START 
THE DAY ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND 
HAVING SAID THAT ACROSS THE NORTH 
OF NORTHERN IRELAND WE COULD CATCH 
THE ODD SHOWER DURING THE DAY FOR 
WALES IT IS A CLOUDY START WITH THE 
RAIN INTO THE SOUTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND WE ALREADY HAVE SOME 
SHOWERS THEY WILL CONTINUE THROUGH 
THE COURSE OF THIS MORNING THEY 
ARE GOING TO TURN HEAVIER FOR SOME 
THEY WILL BE TORRENTIAL WE WILL 
HAVE TWENTY FIVE M. M. AND AN INCH IN SOME 
PLACES THEY ARE GOING TO BE MOVING 
OFF INTO THE DIRECTION OF THE ISLE 
OF WIGHT QUITE A CLOUDY DAY 
ACTUALLY WON A FEW ARE EXPOSED TO 
THE NORTH EASTERLY BREEZE THAT 
BREEZE WILL BE WITH US RIGHT 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND KNOCKING THE 
EDGE OF THE TEMPERATURES THROUGH 
THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON EVENING 
AND OVERNIGHT YOU CAN SEE THE RAIN 
PUSHING INTO SOUTHERN COUNTIES OF 
ENGLAND AND WALES IT WILL BE WITH 
US TOMORROW AS WELL THERE WILL BE 
EFFECTED A CLOUD AROUND WITH SOME 
BRICKS AND SOME SUNSHINE FOR THE 
REST OF US ON SUNDAY IT IS AN 
IMPROVEMENT WE WILL SEE SOME 
SUNSHINE WITH VARIABLE AMOUNTS OF 
CLOUD BUT THE CLOUD COULD BE THICK 
ENOUGH HERE AND THERE FOR THE ODD 
SHOWER BUT NOTHING TOO SIGNIFICANT 
ONCE AGAIN WE WILL STILL HAVE THE 
NORTH EASTERLY BREEZE THAT WILL 
TAKE THE EDGE OF THE TEMPERATURES 
WHICH AT BEST ARE GOING TO BE ABOUT 
FIFTEEN DEGREES CELSIUS WHEN YOU 
COMPARE THIS TO LAST WEEKEND AND WE 
WERE LOOKING AT A HIGH TO MID TWENTY 
CELSIUS IT'S QUITE A SIGNIFICANT 
DROP IF YOU LIVE IN THE NORTH OF 
THE COUNTRY YOU ARE LIKELY TO HAVE 
A TOUCH OF FROST ON SUNDAY MORNING 
THE LAST SURVIVING PILOT FROM THE 
DAMBUSTERS MISSION WILL RETURN TO 
THE DERBYSHIRE RESERVOIR WHERE THE 
AIR CREWS TRAINED BEFORE DROPPING 
THEIR BOUNCING BOMBS A LANCASTER 
BOMBER STAGES A SPECIAL FLY PAST OF 
A DAY WENT DOWN DANNY SAVAGE IS 
THERE TO SEE IT 
WHAT YOU CAN SEE THERE IS THE DAM 
AT THE DERWENT RESERVOIR THE 
REASON WE'RE HERE THIS MORNING IS 
BECAUSE THIS WAS ONE OF THE 
PRACTICE TARGETS USED IN THE BUILD 
UP TO THE DAM BUSTERS RAID THAT 
WAS BECAUSE THIS LOOK SO SIMILAR TO 
THE ACTUAL TARGETS IN GERMANY 
LATER THIS MORNING A LANCASTER 
BOMBER WILL COME SWEEPING DOWN THE 
VALLEY HERE OVER THE RESERVOIR AND 
THROUGH THE TOWERS FLYING AT 
PROBABLY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FEET IT'S ALL 
TO MARK THE SIXTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
DAM BUSTERS RAID THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED HERE TO WATCH 
THE SPECTACLE IT WAS THE MISSION 
WHICH USED BOUNCING BOMBS TO 
DESTROY HUGE DAMS IN GERMANY'S 
INDUSTRIAL HEARTLAND THIS WAS JUST 
ONE OF THE MANY PRACTICE RUNS AHEAD 
OF WHAT IS PROBABLY THE MOST 
MEMORABLE RAID THE R. A. F. HAS EVER 
DONE AND AGAINST ALL THE ODDS THE 
MISSION WAS A SUCCESS MAKING SIX HUNDRED SEVENTEEN 
SQUADRON WORLD FAMOUS EXACTLY SIXTY FIVE 
YEARS AGO TODAY THE BOMBERS WHICH 
TOOK PART IN THE DAMBUSTERS RAPE 
TOOK OFF FROM HERE AT R. A. F. SCAMPTON 
IN LEN FISHER RAID THE CREWS 
WERE SITTING AROUND ON THE GRASS 
PLAYING CARDS OR KICKING A FOOTBALL 
AROUND THEN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE OF THEM TOOK TO 
THE AIR FIFTY THREE OF THEM DIED ON THE 
MISSION THEIR NAMES ARE HERE ON A 
SPECIAL MEMORIAL IN THE SHAPE OF 
THEIR TARGETS THAT NIGHT AND THE 
PLANES WHICH TOOK PART IN THE RAID 
WERE LANCASTERS THIS IS ONE OF 
ONLY TWO STILL LEFT BLIND AND 
TODAY IT WILL FLY OVER THE DAY WENT 
DOWN IN DERBYSHIRE WHICH WAS USED 
AS A PRACTICE TARGET BEFORE THE 
RAID ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 
JOBS WAS THAT OF THE BOMB BAY MARE 
WHO SAT HERE IN THE NOSE OF THE 
AIRCRAFT BUT THE PLANE FLYING AT 
JUST SIXTY F. T. ABOVE THE GROUND HE HAD 
TO MAKE THE DECISION OF WHEN TO 
RELEASE THE SINGLE BOMB THAT EACH 
PLANE WAS CARRYING 
YOU TAKE A 
BIGGER AIRCRAFT LIKE THIS AND TRY 
TO FLY THAT DOWN AT SIXTY F. T. AT NIGHT 
IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE 
PIECES OF FLYING SKILL YOU WILL 
EVER SEE ESPECIALLY IN A MASSIVELY 
TIED BALI YOU CAN'T HAVE A RUN IN 
AT IT YOU'VE GOT TO GET IN THERE 
DIED DOWN TO SIXTY FEET INCREDIBLE 
TWENTY YEARS AGO THIS WAS A TRIBUTE TO 
THE MISSION AND TODAY THOSE 
INCREDIBLE FLYING SKILLS WILL BE 
ACKNOWLEDGED AGAIN OVER A DAM 
WHICH PLAYED A RATHER UNUSUAL PART 
IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR IT MUST BE 
WORTH REMEMBERING THAT THE MOTTO OF 
THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN MEMORIAL 
FLIGHT IS LEST WE FORGET THIS IS 
VERY MUCH REMEMBRANCE SERVICE 
THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT DIED 
THAT NIGHT NOT ONLY THE CREWS OF 
THE LANCASTERS BUT ALSO THE 
HUNDREDS OF CIVILIANS THAT WAS 
SWEPT AWAY WHEN THE DAM WALL WAS 
BURST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW 
BIG THE DAMS WERE LET'S HAVE A 
LOOK FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DAM 
IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE HUGE 
SIZE OF THESE AND ALL OF THE 
VOLUME OF WATER THAT CAME SWEEPING 
THROUGH WHEN THEY BURST TWO OF 
THEM WERE BROKEN AT NIGHT ALSO 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MANY 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED 
IN AS WE CAME IN THIS MORNING 
THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE 
COMING IN YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HERE MANY MORE 
PEOPLE EXPECTED IN THE BUILD UP TO 
THIS TODAY WITH THE LANCASTER 
FLYING OVER AND A VERY SPECIAL FLY 
PAST FROM SIX HUNDRED SEVENTEEN SQUADRON THE 
EXISTING SQUADRON AND THE TORNADOES 
THEY HAVE BRIEFLY THE REASON THIS 
IS SO IMPORTANT TO DATE IS THAT THE 
LAST SURVIVING LANCASTER PILOT IS 
THERE HE IS LES MUNRO AND HAS COME 
ALL THE WAY FROM NEW ZEALAND WE 
WILL HOPEFULLY BE HEARING FROM HIM

SPORTING WEEKEND AND GOOD LUCK TO 
CARDIFF AND PORTSMOUTH 
NO FRIED SLICE TWO SAUSAGE 
TWO EGG THAT'S A SUBSTANTIAL 
BREAKFAST BREAKFAST THAT'S A REAL BREAKFAST 
FOR ME IT IS LUNCH 
ON MONDAY WE INTRODUCED TO KATE 
SPALL WHO FOUGHT FOR HER LATHE 
MOTHER TO GET A LATE MOTHER TO 
GET A NEW CANCER DRUG ON THE N. H. S. 
SINCE HER APPEARANCE ON BREAKFAST 
KATE HAS RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF E. 
MAILS OF SUPPORT AND ALSO QUERIES 
FROM PEOPLE NEEDING ADVICE BECAUSE 
OF YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT STORY WE 
THOUGHT YOU SHOULD RETURN TO THE 
ISSUES AND BEFORE WE MEET KATE 
LET'S HEAR FROM ONE OF THE PATIENTS 
SHE HELPED 
WHAT DO I THINK ABOUT HER IF IF ANYONE WAS IN THIS POSITION THEY 
WOULD KNOW WHAT I THINK OF HER 
SHE GAVE US ENDLESS HOURS OF HELP 
ENDLESS BOOSTING ME UP WHEN I WAS 
DOWNMENT SHE BOOSTED US UP L. 
CANNOT DESCRIBE WHAT SHE DONE FOR 
US FOR NOT ME FOR ME MY TWO SONS 
KATE BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT YOU AND 
WHO YOU ARE AND WHY YOU ARE DOING 
WHAT YOU DO TELL US ABOUT BRUCE 
GOSH WHEN I SEE THAT IT IS SO HARD 
TO WATCH BRUCE IS AN AMAZING MAN 
AND HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER 
LAST YEAR AND HIS ENCOLOGIST SAID I 
WANT YOU TO START THE BEST 
TREATMENT AVAILABLE THAT WE KNOW A 
DRUG FOR TARGETED THERAPY FOR 
KIDNEY CANCER HE SAID I WANT YOU 
TO GO ON TO THIS THIS IS GOING TO 
GIVE YOU THE BEST CHANCE OF SUCCESS 
SO THE ONCOLOGIST CONTACTED ME AND 
BRUCE CONTACTED ME AND WE BEGAN 
APPEALING FOR THIS TREATMENT 
HE HAD BEEN REFUSED THAT TREATMENT 
HAD HE 
WELL HE HAD IT HAD TO GO 
TO A SEPARATE PANEL AND YES IT HAD 
COME BACK AS SAYING IT WAS NOT COST 
EFFECTIVE AND IT HADN'T BEEN NICE 
APPROVED I TOOK ON HIS CASE AND I 
DID THE APPEAL AND WE WON AND IT 
WAS WONDERFUL AND BRUCE TO SEE THAT 
AS I I SAY IT IS HARD TO WATCH 
BECAUSE I JUST GET ON AND DO IT AND 
TO SEE THE REACTION IS QUITE 
DIFFICULT TO WATCH BUT IT HAS BEEN 
AMAZING TO HELP BRUCE 
I MEAN YOU GOT INTO THIS BECAUSE 
YOUR MUM WAS IN A SIMILAR POSITION 
YES YES YOU KNEW THERE WAS A DRUG THAT 
MIGHT HELP BUT YOU COULDN'T GET 
ACCESS TO IT 
ABSOLUTELY WE HAD 
GONE TO SEE THE SPECIALIST AT 
CHRISTIE'S HOSPITAL WHO MENTIONED 
ABOUT THIS NEW DRUG HE SAID THIS 
IS WHAT SHE NEEDS AND I SAID THIS 
IS WHAT SHE HAS GOT TO HAVE THE 
ENCOLOGIST SAID THEY WILL NEVER 
FUND IT AND I SAID WATCH ME AND 
FORTUNATELILY WE DID BUT AFTER NINE 
MONTHS SHE LIVED FOR ANOTHER FOUR 
AND A HALF MONTHS MUM DIED WITH 
HOPE NOT IN FEAR YOU KNOW THE 
PATIENTS THAT AREN'T GOING TO GET 
THE DRUGS WILL GO THROUGH TO 
PALLIATIVE CARE THEY WILL BE SENT 
TO A HOSPICE THERE IS NO FURTHER 
TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR THEM L. THINK 
THAT TRUSTS NEED TO LOOK AT THAT 
WHEN THEY ARE MAKING DECISIONS 
OF COURSE THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY 
EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT DECISIONS 
TO MAKE THAT FOUR AND A HALF 
MONTHS YOU SPENT WITH YOUR MUM WAS 
OBVIOUSLY EXTREMELY PRECIOUS BUT 
IF YOU ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU 
HAVE TO MAKE A FINANCIAL DECISION 
BETWEEN GIVING SOMEONE AN EXTRA 
FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS OR PUTTING 
THAT MONEY INTO SOMETHING WHICH 
MIGHT EXTEND SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE 
FOR FOUR AND A HALF YEARS OR 
PROVIDE SOME OTHER TREATMENT FOR 
THEM CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THE 
DIFFICULTIES IN A SYSTEM WHICH HAS 
SCARCE RESOURCES THE DECISIONS 
THOSE PEOPLE HAVE TO MAKE 
YES OR 
NO IS THE NO 
I DON'T THINK IT IS A CASE OF ONE 
PATIENT HAS A TREATMENT BEFORE 
ANOTHER PATIENT DOESN'T I DON'T 
THINK IT WORKS LIKE THAT WHAT I 
THINK IS THAT EVERY PATIENT SHOULD 
HAVE THE CHANCE OF THE BEST 
TREATMENT THAT THEIR CLINICIAN 
WANTS FOR THEM AND THAT'S WHAT I'M 
SAYING WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT 
PEOPLE LOOKING ON THE INTERNET AND 
PICKING A DRUG AND SAYING I WANT 
THIS CAN YOU HELP ME I CAN'T 
HELP PEOPLE LIKE THAT THE PEOPLE I 
CAN HELP ARE THE PEOPLE WHOSE 
CANCER SPECIALIST SAID YOU WILL 
BENEFIT FROM THIS DRUG I WANT TO 
HELP THEM GET THE DRUGS 
WE HAD AN E. MAIL WHICH WAS FROM 
SOMEONE WHO SAID THAT MEMBER OF 
THEIR FAMILY HAD WANTED A CERTAIN 
DRUG HADN'T GOT IT ON THE N. H. S. AND 
GONE PRIVATE TO EXTEND THE LIFE OF 
THEIR LOVED ONE AND THEY GOT THE 
DRUG THE QUALITY OF THEIR LIFE 
DIMINISHED THEY SPENT LOT OF 
TIME VOMITING AND BEING ILL AND 
LOOKING BACK THEY QUESTION THE 
MERITS OF EXTENDING THE LIFE IF 
YOU LIKE FOR THE SAKE OF IT HOW 
MUCH DO YOU TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT 
IS IT ALWAYS GOOD THING TO EXTENT A LIFE THAT SOMEONE CAN LEAD 
I HAVE TO GO WITH THE CLINICIAN I 
HAVE NO MEDICAL BACKGROUND THE 
IMPORTANT THING IS THE INDIVIDUAL 
PATIENT HAS AN ONCOLOGIST MAKING A 
DECISION ON THIS THE NEW DRUGS 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACTUALLY FAR 
LESS TOXIC THAN STANDARD 
CHEMOTHERAPY PEOPLE GENERALLY DO 
TOLERATE THEM VERY WELL THE PEOPLE 
I NOW HAVING A REALLY GOOD QUALITY 
OF LIFE AND ARE BACK AT WORK THEY 
ARE THE PEOPLE I AM TARGETING IT 
IS DIFFICULT TO SAY HOW THEY WOULD 
RESPOND I WILL LEAVE THAT WITH THE 
COMMISSION IT IS NOT SOMETHING I 
WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN 
AND THERE YOU HAVE HAD HUNDREDS OF 
THE MILLS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
CONTACTING US ALL THROUGH THE 
MORNING WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL I 
KNOW YOU HAVE HAD HUNDREDS OF E. 
MAILS 
QUALITIES AUTHOR NEIL OLIVER THINKS 
ARE LOST ON THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY NEW 
MAN HIS LATEST BOOK IS TO BOAST TO 
INSPIRE BOYS TO BECOME STRONG 
MORAL AND WHOLESOME BY TELLING 
THEM ABOUT THE HEROES OF THE PAST 
WE HAVE BEEN ASKING PEOPLE IN 
NOTTINGHAM WHETHER THEY THINK MEN 
HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW TO BE LONELY 
MARLEY 
I DO NOT THINK IT IS SO MARLEY MUCH THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW TO BE 
HEROES I THINK SOMETIMES THEY'RE A 
BIT FRIGHTENED OR INTIMIDATED 
BECAUSE WOMEN LIKE TO BE SELF 
SUFFICIENT 
I TEACH MY SON TO BE SUFFICIENT MANLY BY TEACHING RUGBY 
BOYS AND GIRLS ARE BROUGHT UP TO DO 
THE SAME SORT OF THINGS 
I DID NOT THINK WE'RE FORGETTING IT 
WOMEN ARE MORE ASSERTIVE THAN THEY 
USED TO BE THAT AFFECTS THE WAY 
MEN BEHAVE 
LOOK AT THE BEARD ON THAT MANLY 
MAN NEIL OLIVER IS HERE NOW ARE 
YOU KNOCKING THEIR NEW MAN 
I AM NOT KNOCKING ANYONE I FEEL 
FOOLISH SITTING HERE WITH LONG HAIR 
AND MAKE UP TALKING ABOUT MANLY 
MEN AT THINK THE SPOTLIGHT OF 
ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ON VERY 
NARROW BAND AT THE MOMENT 
CELEBRITY OR FAME IS ACCORDED TO 
PEOPLE WHO WERE POP STARS OR 
SPORTSMEN I THOUGHT WAS WORTH 
REMINDING BOYS AND THEN THAT 
THERE ARE ALSO ALL THE WAYS TO BE 
AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER LIVES TO 
LEAD THEY CAN GET INSPIRATION IT 
BY LOOKING TO THE PAST 
YOU GO 
THROUGH SOME STORIES PEOPLE ARE 
FAMILIAR WITH SOME PERHAPS NOT SO 
MUCH THE APOLLO THIRTEEN MISSION 
IT WOULD BE WELL KNOWN TO PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE WHAT WAS 
REPRESENTED THEIR IN CONTRAST TO 
THE FILM WAS THAT IN REALITY THE 
MEN IN THAT SITUATION BEHAVED IN 
VERY CALM ALMOST IN BORING WAY 
IN THE FILM WHEN THINGS STARTED TO 
GO WRONG THERE IS A LOT OF SMASHING 
ABOUT RAISED VOICES ALMOST PANIC 
WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN THAT 
CAPSULE WAS VERY CALM VERY 
MEASURED THIS WAS BECAUSE OF THE 
MEN'S TRAINING AND TO SOME EXTENT 
WHAT THE AUTHOR DESCRIBED AS THE 
RIGHT STUFF THERE ARE MEN WHO JUST 
BY BIRTH BY THEIR VERY BEING ARE 
ABLE TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS AT 
THE RIGHT TIME L. JUST FEEL THAT 
SOME OF THAT ATTENTION WANTS TO BE 
FOCUSED ON THAT KIND OF MAN IS NOW 
ENTIRELY RESERVED FOR PREMIERSHIP 
FOOTBALLERS ARE POP STARS 
WHO ARE 
OUR CURRENT DAY HEARERS 
THAT IS A 
VERY GOOD QUESTION HEROES L. 
HAVE ALWAYS FOLLOWED WITH HUGE 
INTEREST SO RAN OFF FINES 
OTHERWISE WAS INCREASINGLY HAS 
BECOME GRIFFEN THIS BASS LINE 
INCREASINGLY HE HAS BECOME VERY 
FAMOUS AND NOT SAYING THAT ONLY 
MEN WHO ARE CAPABLE KATE IS 
SITTING THERE AND SHE IS DOING 
SOMETHING THAT IS HEROIC IN A GRAND 
TRADITION BUT I FEEL THAT RAN OFF 
FINES WAS DOING SOMETHING INVISIBLE 
FOR A LONG TIME USED TO BE BECAUSE 
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIM THAT 
MACKIE WAS DOING IT 
I AM NOT KNOCKING HIS ACHIEVEMENTS 
BUT HE HAS SPENT HIS LIFE EXPLORING 
EXTRAORDINARY PLACES MOST PEOPLE 
IN NORMAL LIVES DO ORDINARY THINGS 
THEY GO SHOPPING IN THOSE 
CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT IS YOUR ANALOGY 
OF A MANLY MAN THE WE BEHAVE 
HIS BOOK IS NOT A LIFESTYLE DIED 
IT IS NOT TO BOAST OF THE INNER 
SELF HAD SECTION IS NOT TO 
BOAST OF THE A SELF HELP SECTION L. 
AM FORTY ONE MY LIFESTYLE HAS STRADDLED A 
PERIOD IN HISTORY WERE BECAME 
LEADER WARTIME ATTITUDE I SUPPOSE 
THAT WAS STILL LINGERING IN THE SIXTIES 
CAME OUT OF 
IN HISTORY 
MY LIFE IS STRADDLED BEEN CHANGED 
I WAS BROUGHT UP IN A VERY OLD 
FASHIONED WAY MY DAD WAS KEEN THAT 
I KNOW BUT I'M NOT CRY WERE WITH 
MY SISTERS 
OF AN ISSUE 
MY SISTERS IT WAS LESS OF AN ISSUE I WAS 
MUM TO LOOK AFTER MY SISTERS TO 
PUT THEM TO THE INSIDE OF THE 
PAVEMENT TO OPEN DOORS TO BE 
POLITE THERE WAS AN NICENESS 
NICENESS IS SUCH AN OVER USED 
ALMOST MEANINGLESS WORD THERE WAS 
A WAY OF BEHAVING AND IT WAS ROOTED 
IN POLITENESS AND KNOWING THE RIGHT 
THING TO DO THE RIGHT STUFF CAN 
HAPPEN IN A JET PLANE OR IT CAN 
HAPPEN ON THE STREET 
WHEN IS THE KIND YOU FELT MOST 
MANLY IN YOUR LIFE WHEN WAS THE 
TIME 
THERE ARE A MILLION ANSWERS TIME WHEN IT BECAME A BAD FOR THE FIRST 
TIME I FELT HAD DONE SOMETHING THAT 
WOULD THAT LEAVE ME THAT I WAS 
LEAVING BEHIND ANOTHER HUMAN BEING 
AND NOW GOT THREE HUMAN BEINGS THE 
VERY FIRST TIME I THOUGHT THAT IS 
SOMETHING BIGGER THAN ME THAT WILL 
GO ON AND DO SOMETHING 
INDEPENDENTLY OF ME L. FELT I WAS A CONTRIBUTION CONTRIBUTION I AM SURE YOU'RE A HERO TO ALL OF 
THEM 
WHO IS AN EXAMPLE OF A MANLY MAN 
APART FROM U. TWO ON THE SET OF 
COURSE SOMEBODY TALL GOOD LOOKING 
A COMBINATION OF SEAN BEAN AND 
SEAN BEAN AND BRYAN ADAMS WOULD DO 
ME JUST FINE TODAY WE START WITH A 
SEVERE WEATHER WARNING THAT IS FOR

GOOD MORNING YOU HAVE ASKED THE 
BIG QUESTION WHEN WAS THE LAST 
TIME YOU USED CALL BOX HERE IN 
CAMBRIDGESHIRE THIS IS THE ONLY 
CALL BOX AND I CAN'T FIND ANYBODY 
WHO HAS USED IT THERE IS A CAMPING 
SITE ON THE EDGE OF THE VILLAGE 
PEOPLE USED TO USE IT FROM THERE 
THE RIVER IS HERE I'M TOLD PEOPLE 
USE TODAY COME OFF THE BOATS AND 
USE THE CALL BOX FROM THERE NOW 
SINCE MOBILE PHONES NOBODY SEEMS TO 
BOTHER IF THOUSANDS OF CALL BOXES 
DO GO ACROSS THE THE COUNTRY DOES 
IT MATTER 
THE PHONE BOX IT IS ALMOST A 
CLICHE BUT AS ONE OF OUR MOST 
RECOGNISABLE FE FURES FADING AWAY 
FOR GOOD AT THEIR PEAK THERE WAS 
NINETY NINE THOUSAND NATIONALLY THE NUMBER HAS 
FALL TONNE SIXTY TWO THOUSAND AND B. T. PLAN TO 
CUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND MORE THEY SAY NEARLY 
SIXTY PER CENT OF PAYPHONES ARE UNPROFITABLE 
BUT THERE ARE SIX THOUSAND BOXES MAKING 
LESS THAN ONE CALL A MONTH 
THESE COBWEBS ARE GOOD INDICATION 
OF HOW OFTEN THIS PHONE BOX IS USED 
THERE ARE THREE BOXES HERE THIS 
ONE AND ANOTHER AROUND AROUND THE 
CORNER AND ANOTHER MILE AND A 
HALF OUT OF THE VILLAGE ALL THREE 
COULD GO BUT TO PEOPLE AND PEOPLE 
AND COMMUNITIES REALLY CARE NOT NOT EVERYONE IS COMPUTER LIT LITERATE 
MOBILE PHONE LITERATE OLDER PEOPLE 
NEED THESE THINGS 
THEY ARE JUST TAKING EVERYTHING

GARAGES EVERYTHING IS GOING NO 
WE DON NEED TO LOSE ANYTHING DON 
NEED TO DON'T NEED TO LOSE 
ANYTHING ANYTHING IF 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT PHONE BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T IN AN EMERGENCY IT IS 
USEFUL TO HAVE ONE 
IT IS NOT JUST VILLAGES SOME BOXES

NEARBY TOWN THIS MAN SAID HE 
RELIED ON THEM

AFFORD MOBILES DURING THE DAY IT

CONVERSATION CONVERSATION MORE US OF RELY ON MOBILE PHONES 
ALTHOUGH WE HOLD THE PHONE BOX IN 
GREAT AFFECTION THESE DAYS WE FIND

MANY MOONS AGO THEY LOST THEIR PUB 
NOW THEY COULD LOSE THEIR PHONE BOX 
IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE THE VILLAGE CLUBBED 
TOGETHER TO RAISE THE MONEY FOR A 
PHONE BOX TWENTY NINE B. T. SAY IT COSTS 
ONE THOUSAND TO MAINTAIN A BOX LIKE THIS 
AND IT IS NOT PROFITABLE BUT THERE 
IS A GENERAL FEELING PEOPLE WANT 
PHONE BOX JUST IN CASE OF AN 
EMERGENCY AFTER ALL MOBILE PHONE 
CAN BE PATCHY IN CERTAIN AREAS BUT 
OUT OF THE FOURTEEN THOUSAND BOXES CONSIDERED 
AROUND FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WILL GO 
THAT'S THE POINT THAT RUTH FROM 
STAFFORDSHIRE SAYS I KNOW OUR
