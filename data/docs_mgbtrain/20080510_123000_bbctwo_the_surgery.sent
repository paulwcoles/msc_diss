HELLO AND WELCOME I'M JEFF LEACH AND THIS IS THE SURGERY 
THE SHOW THAT KEEPS ITS HEAD DOWN AND STAYS OUT OF TROUBLE 
RELAX YOURSELVES FOLKS LOVELY 
SO TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEARAWAY TEENS 
WHY DO THEY SLIP OFF THE RAILS PEER PRESSURE OR BOREDOM WHAT DO YOU THINK FOLKS 
BOREDOM PEER PRESSURE BIT OF BOTH 
WHAT ABOUT A BIT OF GRAFTING INSTEAD 
VOLUNTEERING OR A SATURDAY JOB 
WOULD THAT KEEP YOU OUT OF TROUBLE 
OR IS BEING TAKEN HOME TO YOUR PARENTS BY A COPPER 
PART OF GROWING UP 
BEFORE WE TEAR UP IN THE STUDIO 
LET'S GO TO THOSE UPSTANDING CITIZENS POPPY AND CAT 
TO SEE WHAT'S WHAT 
HI I'M POPPY AND I'M CAT AND TODAY WE'RE DISCUSSING WITH YOU LOT THE TOPIC OF TEARAWAY TEENS 
WHY DO SOME TEENS GO OFF THE RAILS OR MORE SERIOUSLY GET THEMSELVES ISSUED WITH ASBOS 
IS IT A PART OF GROWING UP IS THERE ANY EXCUSE 
OR SHOULD TEENS TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEMSELVES 
ARE TEENAGERS REALLY THAT TROUBLESOME 
OR DO YOU RECKON THEY GET A BAD RAP BECAUSE OF A SELECT FEW 
I'D PROBABLY SAY A SELECT FEW 
DEPENDS ON THE CROWD THEY HANG AROUND WITH 
WE'RE ALWAYS IN THE PAPERS FOR BAD THINGS AND I THINK IT'S A BIT WRONG 
I THINK THEY SHOULD WRITE ABOUT THE GOOD THINGS AS WELL 
WE'RE QUITE GOOD REALLY A LOT OF OUR FRIENDS AREN'T AND THAT MAKES US LOOK BAD 
AS SOON AS YOU TELL SOMEONE YOU'RE A TEENAGER 
THEY AUTOMATICALLY THINK YOU'RE A TROUBLE MAKER AND YOU MAY NOT BE 
DO YOU HAVE ANY FRIENDS OR DO YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO GET INTO TROUBLE 
I DO HAVE FRIENDS LIKE THAT BUT I ALWAYS TELL THEM 
DO YOU WANNA BE LIKE THAT THERE'S A BETTER WORLD 
IT CAN'T BE LEFT DOWN TO ALL THE AUTHORITIES AND STUFF 
THEY BLAME EVERYONE ELSE BUT IT'S ALL DOWN TO THEM 
WHY DO YOU THINK TEENAGERS GO OFF THE RAILS 
IS IT PART OF GROWING UP OR SHOULD THEY TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY 
I THINK PROBLEMS AT HOME OR AT SCHOOL YEAH FRIENDS PEER PRESSURE 
DO YOU THINK UPBRINGING HAS A LOT TO DO WITH TEENS GETTING INTO TROUBLE 
I THINK BACK AND THINK I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO MY MUM 
BUT OTHER TIMES IT'S LIKE I HAD A GOOD TIME 
IS GETTING IN TROUBLE JUST PART OF GROWING UP MONNA 
TO BE HONEST I THINK 
IT'S A LOT DOWN TO BOREDOM IN MY OPINION 
THAT'S WHY 
WHERE I'M FROM THERE'S NOT A LOT TO DO 
IT'S LIKE AN ONGOING THING 
YOU MEAN OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL 
AND IN SCHOOL TO BE HONEST 
SCHOOL'S BORING THERE'S NOTHING TO DO 
LET ME COME AND SEE 
YOU MAKE YOUR DECISIONS YOU CHOOSE THAT ROAD 
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM 
AND YOU NEED TO SORT IT OUT 
YOU'VE GOT CHOICES YOU SHOULD BETTER YOURSELF 
YOU SOUND WORSE THAN MY MUM 
WHOA 
YEAH IT COULD BE THE WAY YOU ARE YOUR LIFESTYLE IT COULD BE PROBLEMS AT HOME YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS 
SO IT'S NOT JUST BOREDOM YOU CAN'T JUST SAY IF YOU WANNA GO THAT WAY IT'S UP TO YOU 
THEY MIGHT HAVE PROBLEMS THEN DO SOMETHING TO BETTER YOURSELF WHAT IF YOU NEED HELP 
HAVE YOU CHOSEN TO MAKE YOURSELF BETTER AND LEARN FROM THOSE MISTAKES OBVIOUSLY YEAH YOU DO 
IS THAT THE MESSAGE YOU WANT TO GIVE OUT 
WHAT IF YOU'RE BORED GO AND DO WHAT YOU'RE DOING GO AND CAUSE TROUBLE I'M NOT SAYING DO THAT 
YOU ARE YOUR ACTIONS HAVE AN EFFECT ON PEOPLE AROUND YOU 
IS IT JUST BOREDOM OR A LACK OF ACTIVITIES IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY IT'S A LACK OF GUIDANCE AS WELL 
NOT ALL CHILDREN HAVE THE GUIDANCE AT HOME 
NO DON'T THINK SO 
YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT GO AHEAD 
I HAD A PERFECT HOME I'VE GOT EVERYTHING I NEED AT HOME 
CAN I JUST SAY IF THAT IS IT WHY IS MY BROTHER IN UNIVERSITY NEVER BEEN ARRESTED DON'T SMOKE DON'T DRINK 
WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE IT'S A FACTOR 
IT'S PERSONALITY IT'S WHO YOU ARE IT'S GENES YEAH WE CAN'T HELP IT 
SO YOU FEEL IT'S MORE NATURE THAN NURTURE 
LIKE WHY WAS YOU BORN WITH BLONDE HAIR 
WHAT ABOUT YOU IS BOREDOM AN EXCUSE FOR THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOUR 
I DON'T THINK IT'S AN EXCUSE 
IS THERE A REASON FOR IT NO 
AT THE END OF THE DAY 
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT LOGICALLY 
YOU MESS ABOUT AND DO THIS AND THAT 
BUT SOME OF US DON'T MESS ABOUT EITHER 
IT'S JUST DOWN TO SHEER LAZINESS REALLY 
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE BEING LAZY TO WRITE ANYTHING 
DO YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT 
WHEN YOU CALL SOMEONE NAMES OR SMASH A BUS STOP YOU'RE NOT BEING LAZY 
MONNA WHERE DOES RESPONSIBILITY LIE 
DO YOU FEEL IT'S SOLELY WITH YOU NOTHING TO DO WITH OUTSIDE GUIDANCE OR SOCIETY 
I DON'T I DON'T FOLLOW WHAT PEOPLE DO 
SOME PEOPLE DO I'VE WITNESSED IT HAPPEN THAT'S WHAT I CALL SHEEP JUST DOING WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS 
ADHERING TO PEER PRESSURE I'VE SEEN THAT BUT IT'S NOT MY REASON NOT MAKING EXCUSES 
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONAL REASON IS 
I WAS BORED I GOT A KICK OUT OF IT I USED TO LIKE WINDING PEOPLE UP 
SO IT'S PART OF YOUR MAKE UP IT'S WHAT DOES IT FOR YOU INNIT 
THERE'S NO HELP FOR NO ONE IN THAT AREA 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO LIKE 
WHAT'S YOUR INTEREST 
WHEN I WAS BORED I THOUGHT 
I LIKE MUSIC AND I'VE GOT MY MATE TO PLAY 
SO I MADE A BAND M. M. M. 
SO YOU FOUND SOMETHING TO DO WITH YOUR TIME 
YOU DECIDED I'M GONNA INVEST MY TIME IN THIS BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT TWENTY FOUR SEVENTHS EXACTLY 
WHEN WE WAS IN SCHOOL IT WAS JUST BOREDOM WE COULDN'T DO THE WORK AND WE NEVER GOT HELP WITH IT EITHER 
I'M NOT SAYING I'M SLOW OR ANYTHING 
YOU THINK A LOT OF IT'S SELF DISCIPLINE 
COME AND SEE THIS GENTLEMAN 
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM I'LL CHOOSE TO DO IT 
ARE YOU ACTUALLY BLAMING SOCIETY OR ARE YOU BLAMING YOURSELF 
I BLAME MYSELF W. W. WELL 
I CAN GO OUT THE AREA REALLY A LOT OF IT'S DOWN TO MY AREA 
I USED TO DO THOSE THINGS TAIL OFF THE BACK OF THE BUS IT'S ORDINARY 
I'M SETTING UP A BUSINESS FOR A LOT OF YOUNG YOUTHS 
I GOT A LOT OF FRIENDS IN PRISON FRIENDS WITH S. T. D.S 
AND I'M TRYING TO HELP YOUTHS MY AGE AND OLDER BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANNA DO 
DO YOU GIVE ADVICE DO YOU TRY TO MOVE THEM AWAY FROM THAT PATH 
ROUND MY AREA THE PROBLEM IS BREAKING INTO CARS TO STEAL TOMTOMS TO GET MONEY 
LET'S TALK ABOUT BOREDOM IS THAT AN EXCUSE 
PEOPLE JUST LOOK AT THE SMALLER PICTURE 
IF THEY LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE MAYBE THEY'RE BORED RIGHT NOW 
BUT IF THEY THINK ABOUT THEIR FUTURE IF THEY MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES THEY CAN ENJOY THEIR LIFE 
SO THEY WON'T BE BORED FURTHER ALONG THE LINE YEAH 
ESSAYS AND STUFF THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT 
HAVE YOU TRIED TO GET A JOB 
THAT'S WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T GET THEY DON'T THINK IT AFFECTS THE FUTURE 
OR VOLUNTEERING HAVE YOU GOT INTERESTS IN A VOLUNTEERING SENSE 
YEAH I CAN'T DO IT TILL I'M EIGHTEEN DRUGS WORKER 
NOW YOU'VE DECIDED GOOD ON YOUR C. V. THAT VOLUNTEERING 
YOU'VE GOT A DESIRE NOW TO DO 
I DON'T DO WHAT I DO ANY MORE I USED TO BUT I WOKE UP AND REALISED 
WHAT WAS THE MOTIVATION TO CHANGE THAT 
NOW THIS IS GONNA SOUND A BIT MAD BUT I GOT BORED OF DOING IT 
YOU GOT BORED OF THE BOREDOM YOU CAN GIVE ANY REASON TO WHY YOU DO IT 
YOU CAN BLAME YOUR FAMILY YOUR FRIENDS OR SAY YOU WERE BORED 
BUT THE THING IS YOU CAN OVERCOME ALL OF THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE LIKE YOUR FAMILY 
NO WAIT WHAT I'M SAYING IS 
WE'LL COME DOWN HERE GO AHEAD 
MY MUM WAS BROUGHT UP IN SOUTH LONDON AND I'M BROUGHT UP IN WEST LONDON 
IT'S HARDER COS I SEE A LOT OF THINGS 
AND SOME OF THEM CAN BE EXCITING AND SOME OF THEM I DON'T LIKE 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GETTING UP TO NO GOOD NOW YEAH I SEE 
IS IT ABOUT THE AREA THEN SOMETIMES IT'S THE AREA AND I THINK IT IS PEER PRESSURE 
BECAUSE MY MUM'S ALWAYS TAUGHT ME DON'T BE A FOLLOWER BE A LEADER 
SO SOMETIMES I DID USED TO FOLLOW PEOPLE IN SCHOOL AND I FOUND OUT 
WHEN I TURNED AROUND AND SAID I WANNA SIT DOWN AND DO MY GCSES 
I WANNA STUDY FOR MY GCSES I FOUND PEOPLE WERE FOLLOWING ME 
THE PEOPLE THAT NEVER FOLLOWED ME NONE OF THEM ARE IN COLLEGE NOW 
NONE OF THEM ARE IN COLLEGE AND I'M IN COLLEGE AND I GOT MY GOOD GRADES 
CAN I ASK DO YOU REGRET WHAT YOU GOT UP TO BEFORE 
WHEN I SEE PEOPLE DOING IT I THINK WHAT ARE YOU DOING THAT FOR THAT USED TO BE ME I USED TO DO THAT 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN SO YOU DO REGRET THOSE THINGS YOU GOT UP TO YEAH 
THAT BRINGS US NICELY TO OUR NEXT SECTION 
BAD BEHAVIOUR IS OFTEN BLAMED ON IT BEING TOO EASY TO GET AWAY WITH 
ASBOS TAGS CURFEWS AND THREATENING PARENTS OF TRUANTS WITH PRISON DOES ANY OF IT ACTUALLY WORK 
DOES PUNISHMENT ACTUALLY STOP BAD BEHAVIOUR FOLKS 
NO A LOT OF NOS THERE 
WE SENT POPPY AND CAT TO FIND OUT WHAT YOU LOT THOUGHT 
ARE WE TOO TOUGH ON TEARAWAY TEENS DO WE NEED TO GET TOUGHER 
WE'RE HERE IN BRISTOL TO ASK THAT VERY QUESTION 
DO YOU THINK WE NEED TO BE TOUGHER ON TEENS 
SOME TEENS BUT NOT ALL TEENS 
I THINK WE ARE QUITE TOUGH BUT WE COULD BE TOUGHER 
I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE 'EM STUFF TO DO SO HAVE MORE YOUTH FACILITIES 
SO THEY HAVE SOMEWHERE TO GO AND THINGS TO DO 
I THINK THERE DO NEED TO BE TOUGHER LAWS 
A LOT OF KIDS THESE DAYS TAKE THINGS FOR GRANTED AND THROW IT ALL DOWN THE DRAIN 
WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WHAT SHOULD THE PUNISHMENT BE 
THEY SHOULD JUST GET ARRESTED OR FINED 
IF THEY WERE ARRESTED AND PUT IN PRISON FOR A WEEK OR TWO JUST TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE 
AND IF THEY STILL THINK IT'S ALL RIGHT THEN LOCK 'EM AWAY FOR A MONTH TWO MONTHS 
I DON'T RECKON CURFEWS WORK COS THEY HAVE A CURFEW AND THEY JUST THINK IT'S COOL IF THEY BREAK IT 
AS LONG AS IT'S REINFORCED MOST OF THE TIME IT ISN'T COS THE POLICE HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO 
DO YOU THINK ASBOS WORK 
NO THEY DON'T WORK AT ALL 
PEOPLE WITH ASBOS JUST WALK AROUND ON THE STREET LIKE 
YEAH I GOT AN ASBO YOU WANT SOMETHING OFF ME MAN 
I'LL SELL YOU THIS TWO POUNDS CHEAPER THAN THE OTHER GUY DOES 
SO WHAT DO WE THINK DO WE NEED TO BE TOUGHER ON YOUNG TEARAWAYS 
ALEX WHAT'S YOUR PERSONAL OPINION 
DEFINITELY AT THE MINUTE WE'VE GOT THE WHOLE ASBOS AND THINGS 
BUT I THINK THEY'RE COMPLETELY POINTLESS 
IN THEORY IT'S A GOOD IDEA BUT IN PRACTICE 
IF YOU'VE GOT A BIG GROUP OF PEOPLE AND ONE OR TWO PEOPLE GET AN ASBO 
IT'S THEN SEEN AS A BADGE OF PRIDE 
DO WE AGREE WITH THAT 
SO YOU DON'T AGREE GO ON TELL US WHY I DISAGREE WITH YOU 
BECAUSE MINOR CRIMES LIKE SHOPLIFTING AND JOY RIDING 
MYSELF I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL HOW MANY TIMES 
THEY HAD ENOUGH AND SAID 
THEY TOOK ME AND A GROUP OF FRIENDS 
AND TOOK US TO NORFOLK 
I COULDN'T SEE MYSELF ROCK CLIMBING AND ABSEILING 
DOING TEAM BUILDING AND BEING AROUND PEOPLE I COULDN'T SEE MYSELF WITH BUT IT WORKED 
SO YOU THINK THESE PUNISHMENTS WORK YEAH TO BUILD CONFIDENCE 
YOU COME BACK MORE INDEPENDENT AND SEE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES I ENJOYED SOME THINGS 
YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THAT I DON'T AGREE AT ALL WHEN I WAS THERE 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE I HAD FUN 
I WEREN'T BAD I ACTED GOOD 
BUT WHEN I CAME BACK I WAS IN THE SAME SITUATION 
YOU SORT YOURSELF OUT FOR A WHILE 
THEN PUT YOURSELF BACK IN I DIDN'T LEARN ANYTHING I DIDN'T BENEFIT 
I DON'T THINK REWARDING PEOPLE IS GOOD 
TOILET WAS ON FLOOR AND EVERYTHING AND THEY STUCK US IN THIS LITTLE ROOM 
WITH A PIECE OF PAPER AND YOU WALK OUT OF THERE AND GO HOME 
AND THAT'S IT IT'S JUST WICKED 
DO YOU THINK ALEX'S APPROACH OF PUTTING THEM IN A CELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS WOULD WORK NO 
WHY'S THAT NOT GONNA WORK BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF TEENAGERS 
THAT'S BEEN ARRESTED GONE TO PRISON AND ALL THOSE THINGS THEY'VE EXPERIENCED IT 
WHEN THEY COME OUT THEY THINK THEY'RE HARD 
THEY THINK THEY'RE BETTER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE THEY USE THAT TO INTIMIDATE PEOPLE 
THAT'S OLDER PEOPLE WHAT ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE IT'S THEIR FIRST OFFENCE 
IF YOU GET PUT IN A CELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT'S GONNA SCARE YOU INNIT 
IT PUTS PEOPLE IN FEAR OF THE LAW SO IF YOU PUT 'EM IN PRISON IT DOESN'T 
IT MAKES 'EM THINK DIFFERENTLY PEOPLE KEEP GOING BACK IN 
HANG ON A SEC GO AHEAD IT MAKES PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF COMMITTING A CRIME 
I DON'T AGREE OBVIOUSLY WHEN I DONE IT EVEN WHEN THE SCHOOL DECIDED THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD DO 
I THOUGHT IT WAS NEGATIVE BECAUSE ONLY PEOPLE THAT WAS BAD WENT ON IT SO I FELT SINGLED OUT 
FAIR ENOUGH YEAH I DON'T UNDERSTAND 
HOW ROCK CLIMBING AND ABSEILING I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT CAN BE A POSITIVE THING 
TO PEOPLE THAT BEHAVE BADLY IT'S REWARDING THEM 
IN MY OPINION BECAUSE OF THAT I WOULD LOVE TO BEHAVE BADLY SO I CAN GO ROCK CLIMBING 
MONNA'S SAYING THAT IT GIVES YOU AN OPTION TO SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT YOU CAN GET UP TO 
SOME PEOPLE DON'T LEARN OFF PUNISHMENT PEOPLE THAT ARE IN AND OUT OF PRISON IT AIN'T SCARING 'EM 
WHAT'S YOUR VIEW ON PUNISHMENTS DO YOU THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE TOUGHER OR MORE LENIENT 
I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE TOUGHER BECAUSE OF ASBOS BEING STATUS SYMBOLS 
SO I AGREE WITH THE LADY 
WHAT WOULD YOU CHANGE YOU THINK KIDS ON THEIR FIRST OFFENCE SHOULD GO IN A CELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
YEAH I THINK YOU SHOULD USE SHOCK TACTICS DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT AS WELL 
IN EARLY NINETIES NEW YORK THERE WAS A CRIME RISE 
THE POLICE USED A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY 
AND FOR EVERY CRIME THERE WERE SEVERE PUNISHMENTS 
AND THE CRIME SEVERELY DROPPED AFTER THAT 
THE CRIME RATE DROPPED DOWN I MEAN DO WE THINK THAT WOULD WORK FOR YOUNG PEOPLE GO AHEAD 
YOUTHS THESE DAYS THEY GO TO PRISON AND SAY THEY GET SIX MONTHS OR SOMETHING THEN COME BACK OUT 
YOU'LL SEE THEY'LL GO BACK IN AGAIN THEY'RE NOT SCARED OF PRISON 
BASICALLY THE PUNISHMENTS SAY AT SCHOOL 
WITH ME AND MY FRIENDS IF ME AND A MATE GET A DETENTION IT'S NOT A PUNISHMENT 
O. K. I UNDERSTAND SAY THAT AGAIN 
EVERYONE HELPS THE BAD KIDS THEY GET SPECIAL ATTENTION 
LIKE LET'S HELP THEM LET'S GET THEM ON SOME ACTIVITY DAY 
WHAT ABOUT GOOD KIDS YEAH 
MAYBE THE BAD KIDS DON'T GET ATTENTION FROM HOME 
SO WORKING WITH THEM WILL HELP THEM SEE HOW DO YOU KNOW GOOD KIDS DON'T GET ATTENTION 
GIVE THEM ATTENTION AND SHOW OTHER PEOPLE CARE EXACTLY 
HELP THEM SEE OTHER THINGS 
IF A PERSON'S GONNA BE BAD THEY'RE GONNA BE BAD WHATEVER YOU DO 
HOLIDAY CAMPS AND GOING ON DAY TRIPS 
SEEMS LIKE A TREAT 
WHY SHOULD PEOPLE WHO MISBEHAVE 
REWARDED FOR BEING GOOD 
KEEP GOING IF THEY CARRIED ON NEGLECTING ME I WOULD NOT HAVE CHANGED 
OLIVIA SAYS SHE NEVER FELT A DIFFERENCE THAT'S HOW SHE THINKS I THINK DIFFERENTLY 
I'M LOOKING PARDON THEY NEGLECTED ME 
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT IF THEY NEGLECT YOU 
YOU'RE GONNA CARRY ON DOING WHAT YOU DO COS NO ONE 
THEY NEVER GAVE ME NO BIG TREAT 
I WAS SLEEPING IN SOME CAMP IN A SINGLE BED 
IT'S STILL GETTING OUT OF SCHOOL LIKE A HOLIDAY CAMP 
IT WAS IN THE HOLIDAYS 
YOU SHOULD TAKE THEM OUT ON LIKE A TREAT HOLIDAY CAMP 
WHAT DID I SAY IT WASN'T A TREAT 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME NO I'M ON ABOUT WHAT THEY WANNA 
ONE SECOND SORRY WE CAN'T HEAR 
WHAT THE YOUNG LADY OVER THERE WAS SAYING EARLIER LIKE 
WHAT ABOUT THE GOOD PEOPLE YOU KNOW 
YOU'RE LEARNING NO NO NOT NECESSARILY 
YOU'D CHOOSE TO DO THAT YOU'D CHOOSE TO DO SOMETHING ELSE 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS A SORT OF TREAT 
YOU'RE SAYING GOOD PEOPLE ALEADY GET ENOUGH ATTENTION YEAH TEACHER COMES TO HER YEAH NOT US 
IF WE'RE TOGETHER WE CAUSE TROUBLE 
AND THE TEACHER JUST BLANKS US 
AND FOCUS ON THEM AND THAT'S WHERE WE GET NEGATIVE ATTENTION 
WHY DO YOU DO THAT THEN 
YOU'LL BE SITTING THERE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE WORK 
AND THE TEACHER IGNORES YOU ANYWAY BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU MISBEHAVE 
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU GET DISTRACTED YOU DO WHATEVER 
THE TEACHER BLANKS YOU SHE'S LIKE YOU'RE NOT WORKING 
YOU'RE LIKE YOU DIDN'T HELP ME 
WHEN THE SCHOOL TOOK ME AWAY I DIDN'T BENEFIT I HAD ANGER MANAGEMENT DIDN'T BENEFIT 
THEY BROUGHT IN MENTORS AND I NEVER BENEFITTED 
WHEN I WAS IN YEAR TEN THEY BROUGHT IN A MENTOR AND SHE WAS DIFFERENT 
I CHANGED I SAID I NEED TO SIT DOWN AND DO MY GCSES AND SHE'S WHAT MADE ME BENEFIT 
YOU SAID IN BLACK AND WHITE IF YOU'RE TOLD TO DO SOMETHING YOU'LL DO THE OPPOSITE 
HOW CAN YOU START TO BLAME SOCIETY I'M NOT BLAMING SOCIETY D'YOU GET ME I KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT AND WRONG 
I SUFFERED I GOT GOOD GCSES BUT I SUFFERED AND I COULDA GOT BETTER BECAUSE OF WHAT I DONE 
I'M NOT BLAMING THE TEACHER OR NO ONE ELSE BUT OBVIOUSLY I'M A PERSON 
THE IMPORTANT THING TO REALISE AND AN ESSENTIAL VARIABLE 
WE'RE ALL DIFFERENT AND WE ALL REACT DIFFERENTLY TO DIFFERENT PUNISHMENTS 
TO DIFFERENT MOTIVATIONS 
I THINK THE IMPORTANT 
WHAT THEY NEED THEY NEED TO PINPOINT 
IF YOU JUST LET ME SPEAK 
I'M LETTING YOU SPEAK I'M LISTENING 
TALKING IN GENERALITIES EVERYONE ELSE IS SPEAKING TOO 
IF THE PERSON WHO'S HELPING YOU OUT CAN GET TO KNOW YOU AND WHAT INTERESTS YOU 
GET TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT'S GONNA HELP YOU 
SEE EVERYONE AS AN INDIVIDUAL EXACTLY 
I'LL JUST COME OVER TO YOU HANG ON I'M SWEATING UP BLIMEY 
THING IS IT IS DIFFERENT FOR EVERYONE 
EVERY PUNISHMENT SOMEONE'S GONNA BENEFIT FROM IT NOT EVERYONE IS GONNA BE FIXED BY ONE THING 
BUT YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET THAT ONE THING THAT HELPS EVERYONE 
AND MAKES EVERYONE A BETTER PERSON BUT YOU CAN GET THERE QUICKER 
BY DITCHING ALL THE THINGS LIKE A WARNING WHAT'S A WARNING GONNA DO 
A WARNING'S NEVER BENEFICIAL YOU CAN GET THERE 
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IF YOU START WITH A HARDER PUNISHMENT 
IT'S GONNA SCARE MOST PEOPLE SO THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO IT AGAIN 
WE HAVE TO TAKE EVERYONE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS 
THAT'S ALL WE'VE GOT TIME FOR I'M AFRAID 
THAT'S ALL FROM ME AND THESE MORAL MR. AND MISSES 
TODAY'S SHOW HAS SHOWN ME AND HOPEFULLY YOU LOT THAT BEING GOOD AIN'T SO BAD 
DON'T FORGET TO JOIN KELLY OSBORNE ON THE SUNDAY SURGERY RADIO ONE AT TEN P. M. 
JOIN ME NEXT WEEK I'LL SEE YOU THEN 
I THOUGHT THE PEOPLE ON THE SHOW WERE VERY MOUTHY SOME OF THEM 
IT WAS HARD TO GET A WORD IN 
THE ONE IN THE WAISTCOAT OH YEAH HIM 
KEPT CONTRADICTING EVERYTHING I WAS SAYING 
EVERYONE'S SAYING WHAT A HARD LIFE EVERYONE'S HAD PROBLEMS 
YOU THINK PICK YOURSELF UP AND CHANGE IT 
PEOPLE FEEL SORRY FOR THEMSELVES 
LIKE THEY LIVE IN A GHETTO BUT WE LIVE IN ENGLAND 
NOT THE SLUMS OF SOUTH AFRICA OR SOMETHING 
THEY DON'T REALISE IT COULD BE SO MUCH WORSE 
IF YOU'VE BEEN AFFECTED 
BY ANYTHING IN THIS PROGRAMME
