TONIGHT A COMPLETE PERFORMANCE OF ONE OF THE GREAT WORKS OF SACRED MUSIC 
HAYDN'S CREATION 
BEGINNING WITH CHAOS 
DEVELOPING INTO LIGHT 
AND REVEALING ADAM AND EVE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN 
WELCOME TO A CONCERT 
CONDUCTED BY ONE OF THIS COUNTRY'S GREAT MUSICAL TREASURES 
SIR COLIN DAVIS 
HE'S BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF BRITISH MUSICAL LIFE FOR FIFTY YEARS 
AND TONIGHT HE'S HERE AT THE BARBICAN CENTRE IN LONDON 
TO CONDUCT THE LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA AND CHORUS 
AND JOINED BY THREE SOLOISTS SALLY MATTHEWS IAN BOSTRIDGE AND DIETRICH HENSCHEL 
ON THE PROGRAMME TONIGHT IT'S JUST ONE WORK HAYDN'S CREATION 
WHAT MAKES IT GREAT IS BECAUSE 
THERE'S HAYDN LOOKING AT THE VEXED QUESTION OF CREATION 
THROUGH THE EYES OF A CHILD IT'S LIKE A WONDERFUL PICTURE BOOK 
AND THERE'S THE TIGER DON'T YOU KNOW 
AND THEN THE LITTLE BOY ON HIS KNEE SAYS COME ON PAPA HAYDN WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DEER 
AND THEN HE'S GOT THOSE TOO HE'S GOT EVERYTHING IN THERE 
AND THE JOY THAT THE PIECE GENERATES 
IS AN INDICATION OF HIS 
FANTASTIC AND INDESTRUCTIBLE SPIRIT 
WHICH IS COMPLETELY IMPERVIOUS TO OLD AGE 
I'D LIKE TO BE LIKE HIM REALLY 
HAYDN'S CREATION OWES A HUGE DEBT TO HANDEL WHEN HAYDN VISITED LONDON IN THE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETIES 
HE HEARD SEVERAL OF HANDEL'S SACRED ORATORIOS 
AND WENT HOME TO VIENNA INSPIRED 
AND ARMED WITH A LIBRETTO WHICH HANDEL HAD NEVER GOT ROUND TO SETTING TO MUSIC 
TELLING THE STORY OF THE CREATION 
HAYDN GOT HIS FRIEND BARON VAN SWIETEN TO TRANSLATE THE TEXT INTO GERMAN 
WHICH IS THE VERSION WE'RE HEARING TONIGHT 
AND SET ABOUT WRITING AN ORATORIO USING ORCHESTRA CHORUS AND SOLOISTS 
TO DEPICT A PANOPLY OF EVENTS FROM PRIMORDIAL CHAOS TO HOSTS OF ANGELS GLORIFYING GOD 
THE CREATION IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS 
PARTS ONE AND TWO TELL THE STORY OF THE FIRST SIX DAYS OF CREATION 
AND EACH DAY FOLLOWS A SIMILAR PATTERN 
AN EXTRACT FROM THE BOOK OF GENESIS 
A DESCRIPTIVE PASSAGE BY ONE OF THE ARCHANGELS AND THEN A HYMN OF PRAISE SUNG BY THE CHORUS 
AND IN PART THREE WE'RE TRANSPORTED TO A BLISSFUL SCENE OF ADAM AND EVE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN 
THE REAL CHARM OF THIS WORK LIES IN THE WAY THAT HAYDN PAINTS A MUSICAL PICTURE 
THE DESCRIPTION OF CHAOS AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE WORK 
THE MUSIC WHICH ACCOMPANIES THE CREATION OF LIGHT 
AND ALL THE VARIOUS PORTRAITS OF FISH BIRDS AND ANIMALS 
HAYDN DEEPLY LOVED WRITING THIS WORK 
HE SAID I WAS NEVER MORE DEVOUT THAN DURING THE TIME WHEN I WAS WRITING THE CREATION 
HERE NOW ARE TONIGHT'S SOLOISTS 
IAN BOSTRIDGE SALLY MATTHEWS AND DIETRICH HENSCHEL 
AND FOLLOWING THEM SIR COLIN DAVIS 
TO JOIN ONSTAGE THE LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA AND CHORUS 
FOR THE CREATION BY HAYDN 
SO WE REACH THE END OF THE FIRST FOUR DAYS OF HAYDN'S CREATION 
AND GOD HAS NOW CREATED LIGHT THE LAND AND SEA THE PLANTS AND THE HEAVENLY BODIES 
STILL TO COME THE FIFTH AND SIXTH DAYS 
AND THE APPEARANCE OF ANIMALS BIRDS FISH AND FINALLY MAN AND WOMAN 
THE END OF PART TWO OF HAYDN'S CREATION WITH THE CHORUS SINGING 
VOLLENDET IST DAS GROSSE WERK ACHIEVED IS THE GLORIOUS WORK 
MAN AND WOMAN HAVE JOINED THE COMPLETED CREATION OF THE EARTH 
THE HEAVENS AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN 
THE SEVENTH DAY ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE IS A DAY OF REST 
AND IN PART THREE WE'RE TRANSPORTED TO THE GARDEN OF EDEN 
WHERE ADAM AND EVE ARE ENJOYING THE WONDROUS CREATION AROUND THEM 
AND REVELLING IN EACH OTHER'S INNOCENCE AND BEAUTY 
SO LET'S REJOIN TONIGHT'S SOLOISTS SALLY MATTHEWS IAN BOSTRIDGE AND DIETRICH HENSCHEL 
ALONG WITH SIR COLIN DAVIS AND THE LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA AND CHORUS 
FOR PART THREE OF THE CREATION BY HAYDN 
IN THE ORCHESTRAL PRELUDE THE FLUTES AND STRINGS HERALD THE DAWN 
DES HERREN RUHM ER BLEIBT IN EWIGKEIT THE LORD IS GREAT HIS PRAISE SHALL LAST FOR AYE 
THE GLORIOUS END TO ONE OF THE GREATEST SACRED ORATORIOS
