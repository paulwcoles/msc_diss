IS IT JUST A DREAM OR COULD IT BE A REALITY 
WE'RE MEETING THE DEAF PARENTS 
WHO DECIDED ON A BILATERAL COCHLEAR IMPLANT FOR THEIR FIFTEEN MONTH OLD BABY 
WE'RE GRILLING THE MINISTER FOR DISABLED PEOPLE 
OVER THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ACCESS TO WORK SCHEME 
ACCESS TO WORK DOES HAVE IN PLACE ROBUST WAYS 
IN WHICH WE ENSURE THAT MONEY GIVEN TO AN EMPLOYER 
OR GIVEN TO AN INDIVIDUAL IS USED APPROPRIATELY 
AND WE'RE SHOWING A SNEAK PREVIEW OF AN EXPEDITION 
TO CONQUER ONE OF THE WORLD'S FINAL FRONTIERS 
WHERE NO DEAF PERSON HAS TREKKED BEFORE THE NORTH POLE 
THAT WILL BE COMING UP AT THE END OF TODAY'S SEE HEAR 
THIS WEEK IS DEAF AWARENESS WEEK ACROSS THE U. K. 
WHAT WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE EXAMPLE OF DEAF AWARENESS 
HOW ABOUT A GCSE IN SIGN LANGUAGE 
AVAILABLE BOTH TO DEAF AND HEARING PUPILS 
I WENT TO LIVERPOOL TO FIND OUT MORE 
IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE BSL 
WAS A LANGUAGE TAUGHT IN MAINSTREAM SCHOOLS LIKE ANY OTHER LANGUAGE 
CAN YOU IMAGINE 
IMAGINE YOUNG DEAF AND HEARING PEOPLE 
BEING ABLE TO CHOOSE A GCSE IN BSL 
ALONGSIDE THE LIKES OF FRENCH AND GERMAN 
JUST THINK OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE 
MORE INTERPRETERS BETTER DEAF AWARENESS 
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS 
WELL THERE ARE TWO SCHOOLS WHICH ARE PART OF A CAMPAIGN 
TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN 
IF IT IS A SUCCESS THIS DREAM COULD ONE DAY BECOME A REALITY 
THIS IS SAINT HILDA'S IN MERSEYSIDE 
LAST YEAR THEY WERE THE FIRST MAINSTREAM SCHOOL IN ENGLAND 
TO CALL ON THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE BSL A GCSE 
THEY HAVE NO DEAF STUDENTS 
BUT THEY'RE RUNNING THEIR OWN SIGN LANGUAGE COURSES 
AND ARE SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING BSL ONTO THE NATIONAL CURRICULUM 
I WOULD PROBABLY PICK BRITISH SIGN LANGUAGE 
OVER ANOTHER FOREIGN LANGUAGE 
BECAUSE I FEEL IT'S EASIER TO LEARN 
I LIKE USING MY HANDS I LIKE SEEING AND INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE 
FRENCH IS LIKE THAT BUT IT'S A LOT MORE WRITING AND THINGS 
WE FEEL IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO BSL IN SCHOOL TODAY 
IF YOU GO OUT INTO THE STREETS YOU MIGHT MEET A DEAF PERSON 
MORE LIKELY THAN MEETING A FRENCH PERSON OR A SPANISH PERSON 
AND YET WE TEACH THOSE SUBJECTS IN OUR SCHOOLS 
SO WE FEEL IT'S TIME THAT WE REDRESS THAT BALANCE 
IT'S THE SAME OLD STORY 
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CAMPAIGNS OVER THE YEARS 
FOR BSL TO BECOME A GCSE 
BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO BE CONVINCED 
THE FIRST IS AN ORGANISATION CALLED OFQUAL 
THE NEW REGULATOR OF QUALIFICATIONS AND EXAMS IN ENGLAND 
IF AN EXAM BOARD SENT US A PROPOSAL 
FOR A GCSE IN BRITISH SIGN LANGUAGE 
WE WOULD FIRST OF ALL HAVE TO THINK HARD 
ABOUT WHETHER IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO CONSIDER IT 
AGAINST THE GCSE MODERN FOREIGN LANGUAGES CRITERIA 
SYLLABUSES WE ACCREDIT AGAINST THOSE CRITERIA 
HAVE TO ASSESS THE FOUR SKILL AREAS 
AND THOSE SKILL AREAS BROADLY SPEAKING 
ARE TO DO WITH SPEAKING LISTENING READING AND WRITING 
IT WON'T BE EASY TO CONVINCE THE RIGHT PEOPLE 
OF THE NEED FOR A BSL GCSE 
ANOTHER CHAMPION OF THE CAUSE 
IS FROM WOLVERHAMPTON UNIVERSITY'S DEAF STUDIES UNIT 
HIS NAME IS KRISTIAAN DEKESEL 
A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL SEE BRITISH SIGN LANGUAGE 
AS AN AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITY OR SOMETHING YOU DO IN THE EVENING 
AT AN FE COLLEGE LOOK AT THE SUBJECTS AVAILABLE 
AND THEY HAVE POTTERY JEWELLERY MAKING 
AND BRITISH SIGN LANGUAGE 
THEY'RE FORGETTING THAT IT'S AN INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE OF THIS COUNTRY 
KRISTIAAN HAS BEEN WORKING ON A BSL COURSE 
ESPECIALLY TAILORED FOR THE GCSE AGE GROUP 
THIS HAS NOW BEEN INTRODUCED IN A NUMBER OF LOCAL SCHOOLS 
LAST YEAR ONE OF THESE SCHOOLS TOOK THE BOLD STEP 
OF PUTTING BSL ONTO THEIR CURRICULUM 
IT'S BRILLIANT THAT JOSEPH LECKIE HAS WELCOMED IT INTO THE SCHOOL 
SO MANY OF THE STUDENTS HAVE GOT ON BOARD 
ALL THE MATERIALS ARE DESIGNED TO BE INTERACTIVE 
THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PRESENTATION WITH NEW VOCABULARY 
BUT A LOT OF THAT FROM THERE IS PAIR WORK AND GROUP WORK 
THE TYPE OF SUBJECTS RANGE FROM INTRODUCING YOURSELF 
TO FINDING YOUR WAY AROUND THE SCHOOL MEETING NEW PEOPLE 
EXPRESSING WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU 
THERE'S A STRONG FOCUS ON THE GRAMMAR THROUGHOUT 
THEY'RE LEARNING ABOUT USING THE SIGNING SPACE 
FOCUSING ON THE VERBS 
BECAUSE BSL VERBS INCORPORATE SO MUCH INFORMATION 
WHICH IS SO DIFFERENT FROM ENGLISH 
IT'S EASY TO LEARN SIGN LANGUAGE 
COS THERE'S MORE PRACTICAL STUFF TO DO 
AND YOU CAN LEARN STUFF EASIER WHEN YOU DO PRACTICAL STUFF 
RATHER THAN SITTING THERE AND LEARNING STUFF OFF SHEETS 
THEN THERE'S CHRIS WOODHEAD 
HE'S THE FORMER CHIEF INSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS 
AND A CAMPAIGNER FOR RAISING EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS 
I THINK STUDENTS CERTAINLY CHOOSE GCSES THAT ARE DEEMED TO BE EASIER 
I DON'T THINK THAT MAKES IT RIGHT 
I THINK WE SHOULD TRY AND ENSURE THAT OUR GCSES 
CONTINUE TO HAVE AN ACADEMIC RIGOUR THAT THEY HAD ONCE IN THE PAST 
IT'S AS MUCH AN ACADEMIC SUBJECT AS ANY OTHER LANGUAGE WE TEACH 
THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT A WRITTEN LANGUAGE IS IRRELEVANT 
A MODERN FOREIGN LANGUAGE WOULD INVOLVE STUDY OF THE LITERATURE 
READING AND WRITING IN THE SUBJECT 
BSL OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T DO THAT 
AND THEREFORE I THINK THAT IT DOESN'T QUALIFY FOR GCSE STATUS 
A BSL GCSE WOULD HAVE TO CONTAIN A SET LIST OF GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURES 
COMPARABLE TO GCSES OF OTHER LANGUAGES SUCH AS FRENCH 
IT WOULD ALSO CONTAIN BROAD TOPICS FOCUSING ON CULTURE MEDIA 
ON SPORTS AND LEISURE 
AND TO BE ASSESSED ON FIXED CRITERIA 
THAT WE ALSO USE FOR OTHER SPOKEN LANGUAGES 
THAT WOULD INVOLVE COMPONENTS SUCH AS ONE TO ONE ASSESSMENTS 
IN CONVERSATION IT WOULD ALSO INVOLVE COMPONENTS 
WHERE YOU OBSERVE OR LISTEN TO SOMEBODY SIGNING 
AND THEN ANSWER COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS IN RELATION TO THAT 
THE WRITTEN COMPONENT OF LANGUAGE GCSES 
MAY NO LONGER BE AN ISSUE 
NEW PLANS ARE BEING WORKED ON 
BY THE EXAMINATION BOARDS AND CURRICULUM AUTHORITY 
WHICH WOULD MEAN GCSES IN MODERN LANGUAGES 
NO LONGER NEED WRITTEN EXAMS 
ONE OF THE MAIN DIFFERENCES IN MODERN LANGUAGES 
FOR THE NEW GCSES 
IS THAT IT WILL NOW BE POSSIBLE TO DO A SHORT COURSE 
IN A GCSE MODERN LANGUAGE 
WHICH ONLY COVERS SPEAKING AND LISTENING BROADLY 
AND SO DOESN'T HAVE TO COVER THE WRITTEN COMPONENT 
I THINK IT IS QUITE LIKELY THAT EVERYTHING I SAY 
WILL BE IGNORED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE POWERS THAT BE 
AND BSL WILL BECOME A GCSE 
THERE'S STILL SOME WAY TO GO 
BEFORE WE SEE BSL AS AN OPTION IN MAINSTREAM EDUCATION 
ONE DAY THOUGH IT MAY WELL BE 
THAT SOMEONE COMES UP WITH A PLAN THAT'S CONSIDERED RIGOROUS ENOUGH 
FOR BSL TO BE CONSIDERED AS A QUALIFICATION 
ALONGSIDE OTHER MODERN LANGUAGES 
NOW MOST OF US KNOW WHAT A COCHLEAR IMPLANT IS 
IT'S AN ADVANCED HEARING AID 
WHICH IS SURGICALLY IMPLANTED INSIDE THE EAR 
SOME SEE THEM AS A MIRACLE CURE THAT MAKES THE USER HEARING 
SOME SEE THEM AS AN INVASIVE OPERATION 
WHICH DESTROYS A CHILD'S DEAF IDENTITY 
THE REALITY IS SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE 
THIS IS JEREMY AND RAVIT FREEMAN 
WHO RECENTLY BECAME THE FIRST DEAF COUPLE 
TO HAVE THEIR CHILD BILATERALLY IMPLANTED 
AT GREAT ORMOND STREET HOSPITAL 
WE JOINED THEM SHORTLY BEFORE THE SWITCH ON 
WE WERE BOTH INTEGRATED INTO MAINSTREAM EDUCATION 
WE WEREN'T REALLY INVOLVED IN THE DEAF COMMUNITY 
WE WERE ALWAYS INTEGRATED INTO THE HEARING COMMUNITY 
HE HAD A HEARING TEST 
AND THEY DISCOVERED HE HAD NO RESPONSE AT ONE HUNDRED DECIBELS 
SO HE WAS REFERRED TO GREAT ORMOND STREET 
A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS VERY AGAINST THE IDEA OF COCHLEAR IMPLANTS 
I AM COPING WITH MY HEARING AIDS RAVIT IS COPING WITH HEARING AIDS 
CHANTELLE IS COPING WITH HEARING AIDS 
WHY DO WE NEED TO GO THROUGH INVASIVE SURGERY 
TO HAVE A COCHLEAR IMPLANT 
BUT HE WAS NOT RESPONDING WITH HEARING AIDS AT ALL 
HAVING MET OTHER CHILDREN 
AND OTHER PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH COCHLEAR IMPLANTS 
IT WAS OBVIOUS TO SEE THAT THE CHILDREN WERE DOING REALLY WELL 
WITH THEIR COCHLEAR IMPLANTS 
AND MY ATTITUDE TOWARDS COCHLEAR IMPLANTS 
STARTED TO TURN RIGHT THE OTHER WAY 
WHAT WE'LL DO WITH ONE ELECTRODE START OFF VERY QUIET 
AND PUT A SOUND THROUGH 
WHICH WE WOULDN'T EXPECT HIM TO HEAR TO START WITH 
THEN WE KEEP TURNING IT UP 
AND WATCH HIM TO SEE A REACTION FROM HIM 
GOOD BOY 
O. K. 
HE'S DONE REALLY WELL 
WHAT HAPPENS I MEAN DOES HE WEAR THEM FOR A FEW DAYS OR WHAT 
WE'LL SWEEP THROUGH AND STIMULATE ON EVERY ELECTRODE 
AT THE LOUDEST I'M GOING TO MAKE IT TODAY 
WE TEND TO KEEP IT QUITE QUIET TO START WITH 
JUST SO THAT HE'S HAPPY TO WEAR IT AND COMFORTABLE 
WHEN I'VE FINISHED DOING THAT 
WE THEN SWITCH THE MICROPHONES ON 
AND IT WILL START PICKING UP SOUND IN THE ROOM 
WHAT KIND OF SOUNDS DO YOU EXPECT HIM TO PICK UP 
WITH WHAT YOU'VE PROGRAMMED 
WHAT WE'D RECOMMEND TODAY IS THAT WHEN YOU GO HOME 
YOU SHOW HIM LOTS OF THINGS THAT MAKE SOUNDS 
SO YOU GO ROUND THE HOUSE 
TURN THE TAPS ON SHOW HIM WHAT IT IS 
THE TELEPHONE RINGING YEAH EVERYTHING LIKE THAT 
TO DATE WE'VE DONE ABOUT TEN IMPLANTS 
WHERE THE IMPLANTS HAVE BEEN DONE SIMULTANEOUSLY 
SO SWITCHING ON AT THE SAME TIME 
WHAT WE'LL DO NOW IS SWITCH THE MICROPHONES ON 
SO IT WILL START PICKING UP SOUND IN THE ROOM 
AGAIN HE MIGHT RESPOND HE MIGHT NOT 
IT IS MEANT FOR CHILDREN WHO WOULD NOT BENEFIT FROM A HEARING AID 
BECAUSE I THINK NATURAL HEARING IS THE BEST 
THEN GOOD EXCELLENT FUNCTIONAL HEARING THROUGH HEARING AIDS 
IS SECOND BEST 
AND IF THAT'S NOT ACHIEVABLE THAT'S WHEN THE COCHLEAR IMPLANT COMES IN 
THEY'LL NEED A LOT OF SUPPORT ESPECIALLY IN THE EARLY MONTHS 
FOLLOWING HIS SWITCH ON TODAY 
HE'LL BE OFFERED SOME APPOINTMENTS TO COME UP TO THE HOSPITAL 
FOR REGULAR SPEECH THERAPY 
BUT HE'LL ALSO RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM THEIR LOCAL SPEECH THERAPISTS 
AND TEACHERS OF THE DEAF 
TO SHOW THEM HOW BEST TO HELP EYTAN DEVELOP HIS LISTENING 
I FELT REALLY PLEASED WITH THE OUTCOME TODAY 
I EXPECTED EYTAN TO CRY AND HE WAS QUITE 
YOU KNOW HE SEEMED QUITE HAPPY WITH THE SOUND HE WAS HEARING 
SO WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR EYTAN 
WE TRACKED DOWN ANOTHER BOY AND HIS FAMILY 
LIKE EYTAN HE'S ALSO GOT BILATERAL IMPLANTS 
EACH IMPLANT RECEIVED AT DIFFERENT STAGES 
HE WAS GREAT ORMOND STREET'S FIRST PATIENT 
TO HAVE A SECOND COCHLEAR IMPLANT 
STEVEN IS DEAF HE IS PROFOUNDLY DEAF 
IF HE TAKES HIS UNIT OFF HE CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING 
HE'S NOT A HEARING PERSON 
BUT WHAT HE IS IS A WONDERFUL MAN 
THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN THE BEST OPPORTUNITY IN LIFE 
HE COULD HAVE ONE GAME OF RUGBY 
AND LOSE HIS HEARING FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE 
IS THAT REALLY WORTH TAKING THE CHANCE FOR 
WHEN THEY'RE TINY BABIES YOU THINK HAVE I DONE THE RIGHT THING 
THEY COME BACK FROM THEATRE AND LOOK SUCH A MESS 
AND YOU THINK OH MY GOD HOW COULD I HAVE DONE THIS 
BUT THEN WHEN THEY'RE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN 
AND THEY'RE DOWN THE PUB WITH THEIR BROTHER 
AND LIVING LIFE TO THE FULL 
YOU THINK I DID THE RIGHT THING 
HE'S RESPONDING TO SOME SOUNDS 
HE'S BEEN RESPONDING TO KNOCKING NOISES 
HE'S BEEN RESPONDING TO THE TELEPHONE RINGING 
HE DOESN'T RESPOND TO HIS NAME 
BUT I KNOW THAT WILL HAPPEN LATER ON 
BECAUSE IT'S STILL EARLY DAYS 
WE'RE JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO EVERY DAY FOR THE NEXT EIGHTEEN YEARS 
AND HOPING HE'LL GROW UP TO BE A FINE YOUNG MAN 
MANY OF YOU WILL REMEMBER OUR RECENT INVESTIGATION 
INTO THE STORY OF DOREEN HARRIS AND HER COMPANY CORNER U. K. LIMITED 
A LOT OF OUR VIEWERS WERE SHOCKED AT WHAT WE FOUND 
BUT THE STORY DIDN'T END THERE 
MARK NELSON HAS BEEN FINDING OUT WHAT HAPPENED 
AFTER THE PROGRAMME WENT OUT 
IN MARCH EMPLOYEES FROM CORNER U. K. TOLD SEE HEAR 
THAT THE COMPANY HAD BEEN USING A GOVERNMENT FUNDED SCHEME 
CALLED ACCESS TO WORK 
TO CLAIM MONEY FOR SUPPORT SERVICES THAT THEY NEVER ACTUALLY RECEIVED 
BEFORE WE INVESTIGATED THIS STORY WE FILMED ONE OF CORNER'S EMPLOYEES 
KONSTANTY BAKOWSKI 
FOR A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT EASTERN EUROPEAN MIGRANTS WORKING IN THE U. K. 
WE ALSO SPOKE TO THE BOSS DOREEN HARRIS 
WHO EXTOLLED THE BENEFITS OF ACCESS TO WORK 
I MUST SAY WITHOUT ACCESS TO WORK HE COULD NOT DO THE JOB HE IS DOING 
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WE COULDN'T DO THE JOB WE'RE DOING 
BECAUSE KONSTANTY'S SKILLS ARE OF A VERY HIGH STANDARD 
AND WE JUST WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE 
WITHOUT TO COIN A PHRASE WITHOUT ACCESS TO WORK 
AT DOREEN'S OFFICE THEY ASKED ME 
WOULD I FILL IN AN ACCESS TO WORK FORM AND I WAS REALLY CONFUSED 
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THE FORM WAS ABOUT 
WE REVEALED THAT CORNER U. K. CLAIMED FOR OVER THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND 
TO PROVIDE KONSTANTY WITH A SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER 
AND A NOTE TAKER THROUGHOUT HIS FIFTEEN MONTHS WITH THE COMPANY 
IN THIS TIME HE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE RECEIVED NINE HUNDRED NINETY ONE HOURS OF SUPPORT 
OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR AND A HALF 
I HAD AN INTERPRETER SIX TIMES FOR A TOTAL OF EIGHTEEN HOURS 
ON THE FORMS 
DOREEN HAS BEEN CLAIMING NINE HOURS OF SUPPORT A WEEK FOR ME 
BUT IN REALITY I WAS GETTING VERY LITTLE 
I FELT VERY PRESSURED 
THEY WERE SAYING YOU NEED TO CLAIM FOR INTERPRETERS CSWS 
NOTE TAKERS AND SO ON 
I JUST FELT SO PRESSURED TO FILL IN THIS FORM AND SUSPICIOUS TOO 
CORNER INTERPRETERS PAID FOR BY ACCESS TO WORK 
WERE BEING HIRED OUT ELSEWHERE WHILST DOREEN POCKETED THEIR FEES 
THIS WOMAN WAS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE SUPPORT 
FOR IN HOUSE STAFF OF CORNER U. K. 
I'D BE WORKING AT THE COLLEGE 
AND CORNER WOULD PUT IN AN INVOICE TO ACCESS TO WORK 
CLAIMING THAT I WORKED IN THEIR OFFICE 
ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY I WAS AT THE COLLEGE 
SO THEY WERE CLAIMING FOR TWO INVOICES 
AND GETTING DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY 
DURING OUR INVESTIGATION OF CORNER U. K. 
SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES RECEIVED A LETTER FROM DOREEN 
TELLING THEM THAT THEY HAD BEEN SACKED 
I'M HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT FOR WORK AND PENSIONS 
WHERE I'LL BE INTERVIEWING ANNE MCGUIRE 
THE MINISTER FOR DISABLED PEOPLE 
SHE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACCESS TO WORK SCHEME 
SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET SOME ANSWERS 
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU 
HELLO ANNE AS YOU ARE AWARE 
SEE HEAR HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING A COMPANY CALLED CORNER U. K. 
REGARDING ALLEGED ABUSE OF ACCESS TO WORK FUNDS 
WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT GOING TO DO 
TO PREVENT SUCH CASES LIKE THIS HAPPENING AGAIN 
WHAT I WANT TO DO IN GENERAL TERMS IS TO GIVE YOUR VIEWERS CONFIDENCE 
THAT ACCESS TO WORK DOES HAVE IN PLACE ROBUST WAYS 
IN WHICH WE ENSURE THAT MONEY GIVEN TO AN EMPLOYER 
OR GIVEN TO AN INDIVIDUAL IS USED APPROPRIATELY 
THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE ACCORDING TO YOUR FIGURES 
THERE ARE VERY FEW INSTANCES OF FRAUD OR ALLEGED FRAUD 
AND YET SEE HEAR HAS BEEN TOLD OF MANY EXAMPLES 
SO IS THERE AN AUDITING PROCESS 
TO ENSURE THERE'S NOTHING UNTOWARD 
WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF CHECKS 
TO ENSURE THAT MONEY IS BEING USED APPROPRIATELY 
INVOICES ARE PROPERLY RECORDED AND SIGNED FOR 
AND INDEED WE ALSO DO RANDOM CHECKS ON THE PROVIDERS OR EMPLOYERS 
YOU SAY SPOT CHECKS ARE MADE 
WE CONTACTED THE LONDON OFFICE FOR ACCESS FOR WORK 
AND ONE OF THE ADVISERS THERE 
ADMITTED THAT SUCH CHECKS ARE EXTREMELY RARE 
WELL CERTAINLY MY UNDERSTANDING FROM OUR BUSINESS CENTRES 
IS THAT THERE ARE SPOT CHECKS DONE 
CAN I SAY TO YOU THOUGH AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL HERE 
THAT WE ARE NOT YOU KNOW SETTING A HARE RUNNING 
WHICH INDICATES THAT SOMEHOW THERE IS MASSIVE FRAUD 
OR OPPORTUNITIES FOR FRAUD WITHIN ACCESS TO WORK 
ACCESS TO WORK IS ONE OF OUR REAL SUCCESSES 
IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING DISABLED PEOPLE IN EMPLOYMENT 
IN APRIL THE SHADOW MINISTER MARK HARPER 
ASKED DO YOU CHECK WHETHER EMPLOYERS HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD 
YOUR RESPONSE THEN WAS NO 
I HAVE TO ASK ARE THERE ANY PLANS 
TO CHECK THAT BUSINESSES ARE LEGITIMATE AND BONA FIDE 
OF COURSE WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE LEGITIMATE EMPLOYERS 
BUT CAN I JUST REPEAT AGAIN THAT THERE IS NOT WIDESPREAD FRAUD 
WITHIN OUR ACCESS TO WORK PROGRAMME 
THERE IS A VERY ROBUST WAY IN WHICH INVOICES ETC ARE CHECKED 
WHERE THERE ARE ALLEGATIONS 
OF COURSE WE WILL INVESTIGATE THOSE ALLEGATIONS 
AND INDEED IF SEE HEAR HAS ALLEGATIONS 
AGAINST A RANGE OF EMPLOYERS 
WHO THEY FEEL PERHAPS ARE NOT FULFILLING THEIR DUTIES 
THEN I WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO ENSURE THAT THOSE ALLEGATIONS ARE INVITED 
THE SHADOW MINISTER MARK HARPER 
ALSO ASKED IF THERE WERE SUFFICIENT SPOT CHECKS 
ONCE CLAIMS WERE APPROVED 
YOU SAID THERE WERE 
SO HOW DID CORNER U. K. GET AWAY WITH IT FOR SO LONG 
WHY WERE THEY NOT PICKED UP EARLIER 
WHY WAS IT SEE HEAR THAT IDENTIFIED THEM AND NOT YOURSELVES 
I AM NOT GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT CURRENT SITUATIONS 
AND FORGIVE ME FOR NOT DOING THAT 
THANK YOU THANK YOU 
WELL WE FINALLY GOT SOME ANSWERS THERE 
NOW TO FOLLOW UP ON SOME OTHER DEVELOPMENTS 
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER DOREEN HADN'T PAID SOME OF HER EMPLOYEES 
SHE DIDN'T PAY ME FOR THREE MONTHS 
CHRISTMAS WAS SAD FOR ME AND MY FAMILY 
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY OR ANY FOOD 
RECENTLY DOREEN SENT LETTERS TO SOME OF HER EMPLOYEES 
THE LETTER SAID 
AS YOU ARE AWARE THE COMPANY HAS SUFFERED FINANCIALLY 
AND YOUR FINAL PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE FROM A PERSONAL ACCOUNT 
SHE PROMISED TO PAY HER EMPLOYEES BY SECOND MAY 
THAT WAS LAST FRIDAY SO HAVE THEY RECEIVED THEIR MONEY 
WELL THAT'S ALMOST IT FOR THIS WEEK'S SEE HEAR 
NEXT WEEK'S PROGRAMME WILL BE SOMETHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY 
ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO A GROUP OF VERY WEARY ADVENTURERS 
TOUCHED DOWN AT THE AIRPORT 
HAVING RETURNED FROM THE NORTH POLE 
HERE'S A LITTLE SNEAK PREVIEW SEE YOU NEXT TIME 
WOW MY CHILDHOOD DREAM OF GOING TO THE NORTH POLE HAS COME TO FRUITION 
TODAY'S THE DAY AND I'VE BEEN GIVEN THIS BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY 
WE'RE NOW ON A HELICOPTER FLYING FROM ICE STATION BARNEO 
TO OUR DROP OFF POINT AT EIGHTY NINE DEGREES NORTH 
WHERE WE BEGIN OUR EXPEDITION TO THE NORTH POLE YES 
HELLO WE'RE NOW AT EIGHTY NINE DEGREES NORTH ON THE FIRST DAY OF OUR TREK 
WE'VE GOT OUR KIT SLEDS AND STICKS 
AND IT'S NOT TOO COLD 
WE'RE GOING TO BE WALKING ROUGHLY NINE TO TEN MILES THAT WAY 
YES YES YES
