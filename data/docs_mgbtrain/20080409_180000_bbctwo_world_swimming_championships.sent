WELCOME TO MANCHESTER TO THE 
ARENA A VENUE WHICH HAS BEEN 
TRANSFORMED FROM A PLACE WHICH 
HOSTS CONCERTS BOXING MATCHES AND 
ICE SKATING BUT HAS COMPLETED AN 
INCREDIBLE TRANSFORMATION OF THE 
BUILDING OF TWO TWENTY FIVE M. SWIMMING POOLS 
OVER TWO MILLION LITRES OF WATER HAS 
BEEN USED AND IT IS THE FIRST TIME 
THAT BRITAIN HAS STAGED THE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS WE ARE BRINGING IT 
TO YOU LIVE FROM THE M. E. N. FIVE THOUSAND 
TICKETS HAVE BEEN SOLD TONIGHT AND 
THERE WILL BE MORE BETWEEN NOW AND 
SUNDAY THIS IS WHO WE WILL BE 
LOOKING OUT FOR ON THE FIRST NIGHT 
OF LIVE ACTION 
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD HANNAH MILEY 
SETTING THE RECORD OF THE BRITISH 
TRIALS LAST WEEK IN SHEFFIELD BUT 
THIS COULD BE THE BIGGEST NIGHT SO 
FAR SHE GOES IN THE FOUR HUNDRED M. 
INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY FINAL JEMMA LOWE 
DESCRIBES HERSELF HAS MISCHIEVOUS 
MENTAL AND COMPETITIVE WHICH 
PROBABLY HELPED TO QUALIFY FASTEST 
FOR THE TWO HUNDRED M. BUTTERFLY FINAL WE 
COULD BE SEEN DAVID CARRY HE IS ON 
THE BLOCKS IN THE TWO HUNDRED FREESTYLE 
FINALS HE WAS THE SECOND FASTEST 
QUALIFIER ALONGSIDE ME JUST ABOUT 
ABLE TO HEAR ME HIS ADRIAN 
MOORHOUSE IT IS AN OLYMPIC YEAR 
WE HAVE HAD BRITISH TRIALS WHERE 
DOES THIS FIT IN 
FOR DIFFERENT 
SWIMMERS IT FITS IN DIFFERENT PARTS 
OF THE PROGRAMME THE BRITS ARE 
COMING OFF FANTASTIC OLYMPIC 
QUALIFICATION TRIALS THEY ARE ABLE 
TO DO SOME GREAT SWIMS AND WE COULD 
SEE SOME GOLD MEDALS HERE SOME OF 
THE AMERICANS AUSTRALIANS SOME 
EXPERIENCED SUMMERS HOPING TO RACE 
HARD YOUNGER SWIMMERS WHO ARE 
GETTING USED TO INTERNATIONAL 
COMPETITIONS A MIXED BAG SHORT SHORT COURSE SWIMMING SUIT SOME SWIMMERS 
BETTER THAN OTHERS AND YOU NEVER 
LIKED IT DID YOU 
I LIKE IT BUT I 
WAS PREPARING FOR THE OLYMPICS AND 
MY OLYMPICS WAS FIFTEEN HUNDRED M. IT IS JUST 
TO GET SHARP BEFORE THE OLYMPICS L. 
AM NOT SURE I WOULD HAVE COME TO 
THIS BUT THERE IS ENOUGH QUALITY 
TO SEE SOME GOOD RACING 
WE WILL JOIN ANDY JAMIESON IN HIS 
COMMENTARY POSITION IS IT LESS 
PREDICTABLE SHORT COURSE SWIMMING 
IT CAN BE DAVID CARRY'S TWO HUNDRED M. 
FREESTYLE WHICH COMES UP FIRST HAS 
SEVEN TURNS AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES 
HE WOULD ONLY HAVE THREE BUT THE 
BIG GUYS USE THE WALLS AND GET 
GOING YOU HAVE TO BE AGILE QUITE 
FEISTY ADRIAN MOORHOUSE WAS TOO 
MUCH OF A BEAST TO DO THAT IT IS 
GOING TO 
BE INTERESTING 
IT IS 
FASTER IN THE SHORT COURSE POOL 
POOLSIDE SHARRON DAVIES SHE WILL 
BE CONDUCTING THE POST RACE 
INTERVIEWS AND IT WILL BE FULL OF 
SHOWBIZ TONIGHT 
IT IS LIKE THE 
ATMOSPHERE AT A HOCKEY GAME BELLS 
WHISTLES AND WHITES IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO HAVE WINGS AS WELL 
EVEN IN THE DARK 
WE ARE GOING TO 
GET THE SWIMMERS OUT FOR THE FIRST 
FINAL VERY SHORTLY LET'S GET A 
LINE UP WITH ANDY WHAT A BIG JOB FOR DAVID CARRY A 
RESPONSIBLE JOB HE HAS GOT THE 
FIRST BRITISH TO SWIM IT IS GOING TO BE A VERY BIG RACE 
TWO AUSTRALIANS IN SEVEN AND EIGHT 
THEY ARE VERY QUICK THEY DON'T 
LIKE BEING ON THE OUTSIDE THEY ARE 
INTRODUCING THE SWIMMERS SLOWEST 
TO FASTEST THIS 
AUSTRALIAN WAS SECOND AT THE AUSTRALIAN TRIALS SO HE WILL BE AT 
BEIJING THE BRAZILIAN IS IN 
TWO IT WILL BE A FIGHT I THINK 
MUCH MORE THAN A HEAD TO HEAD RACE 
IF IT IS THAT WILL SUIT DAVID 
CARRY WHAT A BIG MAN THIS GUY IS I LOVE 
WATCHING HIM SWIM HE WENT OUT VERY 
SLOWLY NOW DAVID CARRY IT IS 
ALMOST LIKE GLADIATORS GOING INTO 
THE RING DAVID CARRY GETTING A 
HUGE OVATION HE HAS NEVER SWUM AN 
INDIVIDUAL WORLD CLASS FINAL HE 
DID REALLY AT THE COMMONWEALTH 
GAMES BUT WHAT CAN HE DO AGAINST 
THE ITALIAN 
THE ITALIAN HAS THE 
EXPERIENCE BUT DAVID CARRY KNOWS 
WHAT IT IS LIKE TO SWIM IN THE BIG 
EVENTS THE ITALIAN IS THE ONE TO 
WATCH DAVID CARRY IS IN GOOD FORM 
BUT HE WILL HAVE HIS WORK CUT OUT 
FOR THE BRONZE BUT HOPEFULLY HE 
WILL GET TO THE SILVER OR GOLD IF IF IT IS A SLOWER RACE IT WILL PLAY IN 
TWO DAVID CARRY'S HANDS HE DID A 
LIFETIME BEST JUST TO QUALIFY FOR 
THIS FINAL THE FIRST FINAL OF THE 
WORLD SHORT COURSE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
SHOCKING 
START FOR ROZSA LENO THE ITALIAN GOT A VERY VERY POOR START AND HE WILL HAVE TO WORK VERY 
HARD THIS IS THE OPPOSITE WHAT YOU 
ARE SUPPOSED TO SEE IN SWIMMING MEET ISN'T THIS ALWAYS WHAT AUSTRALIANS 
DO THEY ALWAYS TAKE IT OUT THE 
REST OF THE FIELD WILL HAVE TO 
START MOVING THE ITALIANS CAN AND 
WILL COME BACK 
DAVID CARRY HAD A 
VERY GOOD FOUR HUNDRED THE AUSTRALIANS ARE 
LOOKING TO HOLD ONTO THIS LEAD BUT 
I IMAGINE THE OTHERS WILL COME BACK 
IT IS EIGHT LENGTHS THE TIME IT 
WHEN YOU NEED TO PICK IT UP IS HERE 
THE AUSTRALIANS LOOK VERY VERY 
GOOD THEY ARE BOTH WORKING VERY 
HARD THE ITALIANS WAY OVER IF DAVID 
CARRY IS NOT CAREFUL HE WILL START 
GETTING SOME WAVES 
I THINK DAVID 
CARRY IS OUT OF IT NOW I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO DO IT 
LOOK AT THAT AND UNBELIEVABLY 
SNEAKY SWIM TYPICALLY AUSTRALIAN 
IF THEY GET THE OUTSIDE LANES THAT 
IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS THEY DID 
IT BEAUTIFULLY AS A TEAM DAVID CARRY FINISHING IN SEVENTH HE 
HAD A TOUGH LANE ASSIGNMENT ISN'T 
THAT JUST TYPICAL OF HOW DO IT IN IN THE SHORT COURSE POOL IT IS NICE 
TO LOOK UP FROM ONE OF THE SIDES 
IT IS THE FAVOURED'S PLACE TO BE 
ELAINE FOUR LANE FOUR KENRICK MONK I BET HE DIDN'T EXPECT THAT A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTING FOR 
DAVID CARRY L. THINK HE WILL BE 
TALKING TO SHARRON DAVIES IN THE 
SECOND TRYING TO ANALYSE THE RACE 
DAVID THAT RACE DID NOT GO TO 
PLAN 
IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER PLAN FROM THE START 
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU 
SLIPPED ON THE BLOCKS 
I DON'T KNOW 
WHY IT IS THE FIRST TIME THAT HAS 
EVER HAPPENED TO ME MAYBE I WAS 
TRYING TO PUT TOO MUCH POWER DOWN 
IN THE BEGINNING IT IS NOT GOOD 
HE THEN STARTED TO GET IT WAVES 
FROM THE BIG GUYS WERE YOU AWARE 
OF THAT 
I TRIED TO STAY AHEAD OF 
THE WAVES AND I'VE WORKED SO HARD 
TO COME BACK LEVEL WITH THEM I I KNOW YOU WILL GO AND WORK HARD 
AGAIN FOR THE REAL WORK RELAY WE WE ARE HOPEFUL FOR VAT FOR TOMORROW 
THE FOUR HUNDRED IS THE BEST EVENT SO I AM 
LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT I THINK HE DID REALLY WELL IN THE HEATS HE IS TOUGH GUY 
COMMONWEALTH CHAMPION 
HE MISSED 
THE START FOR HIM HIM AND THE 
ITALIAN DID THE SAME THING HE IS A 
TOUGH COMPETITOR HE IS GOOD AT FOUR HUNDRED 
GET HIM BACK IN THE RACE AND HAVE 
HIM SWIMMING TOUGH 
THANK GOD WE 
ARE NOT COACHING THEM 
IT IS AN 
INTERESTING THING TO DEAL WITH HE 
HAS NOT SWAM AS FAST AS HE WANTED 
STILL HIS LIFETIME 
BEST 
HE IS A 
TOUGH GUY IF I WAS ON HIS REALIGN 
I WOULD LIKE HIM TO START YOU YOU CANNOT GET THOSE DETAILS WRONG AT 
THIS LEVEL CAN YOU IN BEIJING YOU 
WILL ONLY GET ONE SHOT AND IF YOU 
SLIP ON THE START IT IS YOUR FAULT 
WHEN CLARE ASKED US ABOUT SHORT 
COURSE SWIMMING YOU CANNOT MESS UP 
ON THE TURNS I FORGOT TO SAY ABOUT 
THE START YOU CANNOT MAKE ANY 
MISTAKES AT WORLD LEVEL AND THAT IS 
A GOOD EXAMPLE IF DAVID CARRY HAD 
TO DO IT HE HAS GOT IT OUT OF THE 
WAY IN HIS LIFE ONCE 
THE FIRST 
SEMI FINAL OF THE WOMEN'S FIFTY M. 
BREASTSTROKE KATE HEYWOOD IS IN 
FOR THE FASTEST WOMAN IN HISTORY 
ON THE FIFTY M. BREASTSTROKE JADE 
EDMONDSON GOES INANE FIVE FOR 
AUSTRALIA AUSTRALIA HOW WOULD YOU SUM UP THE SEMI 
FINAL 
FLAT OUT L. AM LOOKING FINAL FORWARD TO KATE HEYWOOD SWIMMING 
THIS BECAUSE SHE HAS THE CHANCE OF 
QUALIFYING IN ONE OF THE FASTEST 
NAMES BUT EDMONDSON THIS IS HER 
ONE SHOT AT DOING ANYTHING GREAT 
THIS YEAR EDMONDSON VERY TOUGH THEY ARE INTRODUCING THE SWIMMERS 
DIFFERENTLY TO NORMAL NORMALLY 
THEY WOULD PARADE OUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT NOW THEY 
ARE BEING INTRODUCED SLOWEST TWO 
FASTEST FOUR IS THE FASTEST THE 
WORLD RECORD HOLDER NOW KATE 
HEYWOOD SHE IS 
THE LITTLE NERVOUS THERE IS NOTHING BETTER THAN HAVING THE HOME CROWD SHE YOU ON L. L. THINK 
WE ARE BOTH EXPERIENCED IT'S 
COUPLE OF TIMES 
HIS THE 
BREASTSTROKE FLAT OUT FROM THE 
START 
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ON START BREASTSTROKE NOT TO SNATCH THE 
WATER THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF 
HOLDING BACK JUST A LITTLE BIT THE FIRST SEMI FINAL OF THE WOMEN'S FIFTY M. BREASTSTROKE IN THE YELLOW HAT OF AUSTRALIA IN 
FIVE JADE EDMONSTONE 
A 
FIVE JADE EDMONSTONE A FANTASTIC START IF YOU CANNOT GET A GOOD 
START YOU ARE NOT GOING TO WIN 
THESE RACES KATE HEYWOOD WILL COME 
BACK I THINK SHE WILL GET AMONGST 
THE TOP THREE THE GREAT SWIM FROM KATE HEYWOOD 
THAT WAS LIFETIME BEST FOR HER 
SHE SWAM SO WELL AT THE OLYMPIC 
TRIALS TO GO TO BEIJING SHE IS IN 
GREAT SHAPE 
BUT THIS LADY ALSO IS 
LOOKING AT HER TECHNIQUE SHE 
ALMOST GLIDES ON TOP OF THE WATER 
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR BREASTSTROKE TO 
GET ON TOP OF THE WATER IT IS A 
LITTLE BIT LIKE SURFING JADE EDMISTONE HAD A FANTASTIC START THREE VERY FAST SWIMS THEY SHOULD 
MAKE THE FINAL KAPISHINA SHE HAS 
NOT MADE A MAJOR FINAL YET AND I 
DON'T THINK SHE WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH 
KATE HAYWOOD NOW ON POOLSIDE WITH 
SHARRON DAVIES 
A SECOND PERSONAL BEST OF THE DAY 
YOU LOOK VERY GOOD IN THAT YOU 
HAVE DONE QUITE A FEW COMMONWEALTHS 
AND OLYMPICS BUT ANYTHING LIKE 
THIS NO 
THIS NO IT IS PRETTY GOOD THIS ACTUALLY IT IS A GOOD CROWD AND 
BEING IN A HOME ENVIRONMENT DOES 
HELP THE GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT 
HOW EASY IT IS TO SNATCH IN 
BUTTERFLY IT WHEN YOU'RE DOING A 
FIFTY M. IS HOW DO YOU MANAGE TO HOLD 
ONTO YOUR STROKE 
LIKE YOU SAY IF YOU START 
SNATCHING AT IT YOU DON'T MOVE 
FORWARD JUST SKEEBY FLOWING OR YOU 
WILL GO BACKWARDS IF YOU START 
RUSHING IT 
I'M SURE YOU WOULD LIKE 
THE BRITISH RECORD 
IT'S HAS BEEN 
THERE FOR A LONG TIME IT WOULD BE 
WONDERFUL TO GET THAT MAYBE I WILL 
GET IT TOMORROW 
WE HOPE SO GOOD 
LUCK 
THANK YOU LUCK EIGHT YEN YOU SAID DON'T RUSH IT 
SHE DIDN'T RUSH IT AND IT LOOKED 
VERY GOOD ADRIAN 
YOU KNOW YOU 
ARE PREPARED FOR IT WHEN YOU GET 
INTO THE FIFTY M. YOU FEEL STRONG AND 
FAST AND YOU MAY SIT UP ON THE 
FIRST FIVE METRES BY BEING TOO KEEN 
INTERESTING ABOUT RUSHING IT THIS 
YOUNG LADY HERE ZOE BAKER WHEN 
SHE DOESN'T SHE IS BRILLIANT BUT 
SOMETIMES SHE DOES TOWARDS THE END 
OF THE RACE ZOE BAKER NOW 
REPRESENTING NEW ZEALAND BUT SHE 
HAS THE BRITISH RECORD THAT WAS 
SET A LONG TIME AGO IN TWO THOUSAND TWO SHE 
WENT TO NEW ZEALAND AFTER TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
JESSICA HARDY EQUALLED HER LIFETIME 
BEST TO BECOME THE FASTEST 
QUALIFIER FOR THIS SEMI FINAL INTERESTING THAT 
THE FASTEST QUALIFIER IS BEING INTRODUCED TO THE CROWD LAST WHICH GIVES HER THE 
LEAST TIME TO PREPARE 
I DON'T 
THINK I WOULD LIKE THAT THE REST 
OF THE SWIMMERS HAVE CHANGED GOT 
THEIR TRACKSUIT OFF THEN YOU 
WALKOUT IT ALLOWS YOU HAVE BEEN IT 
A MINUTE IN THE SCHEDULE TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO SETTLE 
THE START IS ALL IMPORTANT AND A 
VERY GOOD START INDEED FOR THE 
RUSSIAN IN NO SEVEN A SHOCKING START 
IN NUMBER FOUR JESSICA HARDY SHE 
HAS A MASSIVE AMOUNT TO DO SHE 
MUST BE ONE SECOND BEHIND AFTER 
THAT START IF SHE DOESN'T MAKE 
THIS FINAL SHE IS COMING BACK IN 
THE CENTRE SHE HAS A HUGE AMOUNT 
TO DO ZOE BAKER LOOKS GOOD ONE 
LANE UP IN THE SILVER HAT THE NEW 
ZEALAND WHAT A GREAT SWIM THAT WAS 
SHE HAD A SHOCKING START 
THAT IS A 
GOOD SWIM FOR BAKER SHE GOT OFF TO 
A FLYING START AND DIDN'T LET GO OF 
THE RACE SHE DOESN'T LOOK THAT OUT 
OF BREATH ACTUALLY SHE HAD A GREAT 
CAREER IN ENGLAND AS A BRITISH 
SWIMMER BEFORE SHE MOVED TO NEW 
ZEALAND HOLDING THAT BRITISH 
RECORD STILL AS YOU SAID NOT TOO 
FAR AWAY FROM THE TIME SHE'S ONE 
THERE IT WAS A PRETTY QUICK ONE 
IT WILL STICK HAIR IN THE FINAL 
SECOND FASTEST JESSICA HARDY I 
DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AT THE 
START BUT SHE WAS MILES BEHIND IT IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT SHE 
SAYS ABOUT THE BLOCKS BECAUSE IF 
SHE SLIPPED AGAIN THERE THEY WILL 
HAVE TO DO SOME WORK ON THAT ALL 
FOUR QUALIFIED IT IS NEVER USUALLY 
THAT EQUAL IT IS DONE ON TIMES 
THE FASTEST EIGHT TIMES QUALIFIED 
THERE IS THE QUALIFIERS FOR THE 
FINAL ZOE BAKER IS TALKING TO 
SHARRON SHARRON HAVE YOU STILL BEEN BRITISH THAT 
WOULD BE A BRITISH RECORD YOU ARE 
NOT BUT STILL GREAT TO SEE YOU ARE 
SWIMMING WELL 
I WOULD LIKE TO BE 
BRITISH 
WERE WE MISS YOU 
WHEN I BRITISH AM HERE I FEEL AS THOUGH I AM HOME 
MY ROOTS ARE HERE MANCHESTER IS A LUCKY CITY FOR ME 
AND I 
REALLY 
ENJOYED IT OUT THERE 
A GOOD 
OF YOURS IS MARK FOSTER WHEN YOU 
STILL BE AROUND AT THIRTY EIGHT AS WELL MARK MARK IS AN INSPIRATION FOR ME I DON'T 
FEEL SO OLD NEXT TO HIM IF HE CAN 
DO IT THE THIRTY EIGHT THERE IS A LONG WAY 
FOR ME YET L. MESSED UP MY TURN A 
BIT THERE SO HOPEFULLY I CAN BREAK 
THIRTY SECONDS L. DID SAY IF I CAN 
BREAK THIRTY SECONDS 
I WILL RETIRE BUT I DON'T THINK I WANT TO 
WE WOULD 
STILL LIKE TO SEE YOU BREAK THIRTY 
SECONDS GOOD LUCK 
IF SHE BREAKS THIRTY SECONDS SHE SHOULD 
DEFINITELY STAY SHE WILL 
BE VERY 
CLOSE TO THE WORLD RECORD SWIMMERS 
NOW PARADING FOR THE SEMI FINAL OF 
THE ONE HUNDRED M. MEN'S BRETT BACKSTROKE 
IN A LOT OF SPORTS IT IS GOOD TO 
HAVE SOMEBODY TO PACE YOU SOMEBODY 
YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE ONE OF YOUR 
TEAM MATE THERE IT IS COMFORTING THING IN A WAY 
THIS IS THE EUROPEAN SHORT COURSE 
CHAMPION ON THE ONE HUNDRED M. BACKSTROKE 
THIS IS GOING TO BE INTERESTING 
THERE IS A VERY FAST SECOND SEMI 
FINAL THESE GUYS HAVE GOT TO MOTOR 
THEY MUST BE A VERY QUICK NUMBER FIVE IS VERY FAST ON THE WATER UNDERWATER WHAT LANE FIVE UNDER WATER YOU ARE 
ALLOWED FIFTY M. ON THE WATER THEY CAN 
SWIM PRETTY MUCH SIXTY METRES 
UNDERWATER HERE BECAUSE THEY CAN GO 
FIFTEEN OFF EACH STARTING TURN LOOK HOW 
QUICK HE IS UNDER WATER ROBERT EARLY FROM AUSTRALIA THE 
SECOND FASTEST AUSSIE OF ALL TIME 
BEHIND MATT WELSH SO HE IS NOT SO 
SLOW 
A GOOD SWIM FROM THESE GUYS 
FIFTY POINT SEVEN IS QUICK ONE SAID THEY HAD TO GO FAST IN 
ACTUAL FACT AUSTRALIA COME HALFWAY 
AROUND THE WORLD TO SWIM AGAINST 
EACH OTHER THEY HAVE TIED L. HATE 
TYING WHEN YOU ARE IN THIRD 
POSITION PARTICULARLY IF YOU HAVE 
A VERY BIG SEMI TO COME IF YOU 
ARE EQUAL EIGHTH FASTEST YOU HAVE TO 
DO THIS WOULD LAUGH FOR THE FINAL 
BUT UNDER WATER THESE AMERICANS 
ARE JUST BRILLIANT DO HER SWIM 
OFF 
THERE IS A LOT OF SHORT COURSE OFF IN AMERICA THE TECHNICALITIES ARE SO IMPORTANT IN THIS SIZE POOL THE TIME TO BEAT HIS FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE IF YOU 
CAN BE THAT YOU HAVE A CRACKING 
CHANCE OF MAKING THE FINAL WHAT A 
SEMI WE HAVE HERE LIAM TANCOCK IS 
THE COMMONWEALTH CHAMPION BUT ALSO 
THE NEW WORLD RECORD HOLDER AND FIFTY M. 
BACKSTROKE YES HE IS ON FORM HE BACKSTROKE HAS HAD TO MOVE UP TO ONE HUNDRED M. FROM HIS 
PREFERRED FIFTY M. HE HAS BEEN 
SERIOUSLY RACING ON A PROFESSIONAL 
A LEVEL FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS 
THIS IS THE LAST PLACE REALLY 
BEFORE BEIJING HE IS GOING TO 
AFTER RAISED PEOPLE WE WILL FACE IN 
BEIJING AGAIN WE ARE SEEING THE BEIJING SWIMMERS PARADING AND THE SLOWEST 
FIRST L. THINK I WOULD PREFER TO BE 
OUT FIRST GIVE ME TIME TO GET MY 
KIT OFF AND GET MY GOGGLES READY 
MAYBE FLAT SPLASH SOME WATER IN 
MY FACE THE WATER IS CHILE THOSE THOSE GUYS HAVE GOT TO BE UNDER THEREFORE 
ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES TO GET WARM YOU 
ARE RIGHT ANDY SOME OF THESE 
SWIMMERS WHO COME OUT FIRST THEY 
GET A CHANCE TO SIT BACK TAKE 
THEIR TIME RELAX VISUALISE THE 
RACE IT IS MATTHEW CLAY IN LANE 
THREE A GREAT RESPONSE FROM THE 
CROWD 
HE LOOKS PUMPED UP HE DOES HERE WE HAVE NOT SEEN HIM TO ONE HUNDRED 
HE WAS IN SUPER SHAPE FOR THE 
OLYMPIC TRIALS ALSO HIS MEDLEY WAS 
AWESOME ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT THIS 
IS THE SIX TIMES EUROPEAN GOLD 
MEDALLIST HE IS THE MAN TO BEAT 
BUT WHAT CAN LIAM TANCOCK DO L. 
WONDER IF HE WILL GO FOR IT IN THE 
SEMI FINAL HE DOESN'T NEED TO BUT 
I THINK IF IT WAS ME I MIGHT HAVE A 
GO 
I THINK BOTH OF THE BRITS WILL GO HAVE A GO LIAM TANCOCK WILL GO OUT 
FAST HIS ARMS WILL BE GOING LIKE 
WINDMILLS LIKE THE CLAPPERS CLAY IN THREE LIAM TANCOCK IN LANE FIVE 
THEY ARE ALLOWED FIFTEEN METRES FIVE UNDERWATER FOR THE START LIAM 
TANCOCK GOT A GREAT START CLAY NOT 
GOING BADLY BUT LIAM TANCOCK HAS 
ATTACKED THE FIRST FIFTY M. WE SHOULD 
HAVE EXPECTED IT BUT IT IS 
BRILLIANT ALSO GOING WELL AS PETER 
MARSHALL OF THE U. S. A. RODIN AND 
MARSHALL NOT LETTING LIAM TANCOCK 
HAVE HIS OWN WAY WHAT AN EXCITING 
RACE 
HE CERTAINLY DOES LEAVE IT RACE CLOSED IF YOU GO PAST FIFTEEN YOU WILL 
BE DISQUALIFIED IMMEDIATELY LIAM 
TANCOCK SET A RECORD OF FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTEEN I 
THINK HE IS ON FOR THAT BUT HE IS 
STARTING TO TIRE A LITTLE BIT THE 
TIME FOR LIAM TANCOCK WAS JUST 
OUTSIDE THE TIME HE SET IT WILL BE 
TIGHT TO MAKE THE FINAL I AM NOT 
SURE HE MADE IT MAYBE JUST WITH WITH THE BENEFIT OF COMPUTERS ON OUR 
DESK WE KNOW THAT HE QUALIFIES IN 
EIGHTH PLACE JUST SNEAKS INTO THE 
FINAL HE TIRED TOWARDS THE END IN 
THE LAST EIGHT METRES I WONDER IF 
HE WENT OFF A LITTLE BIT TOO 
QUICKLY TOO EXCITED ON THE FIRST 
TWENTY FIVE METRES HOPEFULLY WE WILL SEE 
ROGAN S. LAST TERM TURN THAT 
LEAD HE DID THAT ON THE LAST TURN 
THEIR EXPERIENCE HE IS THE REAL 
THREAT TOMORROW 
HE HAS ONLY GOT A 
QUALIFIED THIRD FASTEST FOR THE 
FINAL I THINK THE GUYS GOT SCARED 
IN THAT FIRST SEMI HERE ARE THE 
RESULTS NOT A BAD LAYING FOR LIAM 
TANCOCK ON THE OUTSIDE LANE LIAM HAVE YOU GOT LONG FINGERNAILS 
BECAUSE YOU JUST SQUEEZED IT YES YES I MANAGED TO JUST GET IT SO IT IS 
ALL TO PLAY FOR 
MARCUS HAD 
FANTASTIC TERMS WERE YOU AWARE OF 
HIM BOBBING UP 
HE IS ONE OF THE 
BEST IN THE WORLD UNDER WATER THAT 
IS WHY I FAVOUR SHORT COURSE L. 
NEED TO GIVE IT MY BEST AND SEE 
WHAT HAPPENS 
MATT COME AND 
US I GUESS YOU ARE 
YES I MOCKED UP MY FIRST TURN 
HIT EVERY TURN AND TRIED TO COME 
BACK BUT MY LEGS WERE FEELING TIRED 
TOMORROW YOU ARE IN LONG COURSE 
FORM AT THE MOMENT HAVE YOU GOT 
TIME TO WORK ON SHORT COURSE FORM 
YES I HAVE THE EVENING TO RECOVER 
NOW AND I WILL GET BACKING SHAVED 
GET 
RID OF 
THIS AND LOOK FORWARD TO 
IT AND HAVE FORMED 
WE TALKED A EARLIER ABOUT THE FACT 
THAT SHORT COURSE SWIMMING IS LESS 
PREDICTABLE BECAUSE IT PUNISHES 
MISTAKES ON EVERY TURN AND AT THE 
START HOW IS IT GOING SO FAR IT 
IS NOT EASY IF WE TRY TO GIVE 
WINNERS FOR EVERY RACE WE HAVE SEEN 
WE MIGHT HAVE GOT A FEW WRONG 
DON'T BET ON SWIMMING THE MEN'S 
TWO HUNDRED M. FREESTYLE THE AUSTRALIANS 
WERE SUPERB THEY TOOK IT ON 
THEMSELVES AS A TEAM AND THEY SWAM 
BRILLIANTLY WELL WE HAVE BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT THE STARTS AND TURNS 
WE HAVE SEEN SOME BRILLIANT TURNS 
AND ALSO SOME SHOCKING ONES ALSO ALSO WITH MATTHEW CLADE SAYING HE MUST 
HAVE A TURN YOU CANNOT DO IT AT 
THIS LEVEL L. THINK WE ARE 
DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE EXCITEMENT 
HAS NOT TRANSLATED THE PEOPLE 
GETTING IT RIGHT ARE THE 
AUSTRALIANS AND THE AMERICANS IT IT IS AUSTRALIA IN GOLD MEDAL POSITION 
FOR THE FIRST OF THE MEDAL 
CEREMONIES 
ADVANCED TO AUSTRALIA FAIR I KNOW 
THE WORDS TO THIS SONG THE SILVER 
MEDAL GOING TO PARMA KIRK PARMA 
THE BRONZE MEDAL GOING TO ITALY 
SILVER TO AUSTRALIA AND OMINOUSLY 
L. HAVE TO SAY THE FIRST MEDALS OF 
THESE SHORT COURSE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
GOAL TO AUSTRALIA SILVER TO 
AUSTRALIA KENRICK MONK FROM 
AUSTRALIA GREAT NAMES HAVE WON 
THIS IN THE PAST INCLUDING IAN 
THORPE AND MICHAEL PHELPS THE 
ITALIAN NEVER WON SHORT COURSE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS P. HAS BEEN ON THIS 
PODIUM SO MANY TIMES BUT IT IS 
ALWAYS ON THE LOWER ONE HE HAS 
BEEN KENRICK MONK OF AUSTRALIA 
ADVANCE TO 
AUSTRALIA FAIR 
ONE OF THE INTERESTED OBSERVERS IS 
CLIVE WOODWARD WHAT WILL HE BE 
LOOKING FOR TONIGHT IN TERMS OF HIS 
METICULOUS NOTE TAKING 
HE IS 
WORKING SPECIFICALLY WITH SOME OF 
THE HIGH LEVEL ATHLETES THOSE 
EXPECTED TO GET ON THE PODIUM HE 
WILL BE LOOKING AT SOME OF THOSE 
WHO NEED A BIT OF EXTRA TRAINING 
IT IS A MASSIVE REMITS FOR HIM TO 
CALL FOR ALL OF THE SPORTS HE HAS 
TO GET AMONG EAST PARTICULARLY THE 
WELL KNOWN ONES 
HE WILL BE 
IMPRESSED WITH THE QUALITY OF 
SWIRLING PARTICULARLY THE TEENAGE 
GIRLS JEMMA LOWE QUALIFIED THIS 
MORNING IN STYLE FOR THE TWO HUNDRED M. 
BUTTERFLY FINAL SHE SHOULD GO 
PRETTY WELL 
I THINK SHE IS ON REAL 
FORM 
SHE SPOKE TO SHARRON DAVIES FORM AFTER QUALIFICATION 
ALL SCHOOLKIDS ARE SHOUTING FOR YOU 
HOW ARE YOU FEELING 
IT IS UNREAL 
I WASN'T EVEN NERVOUS I WAS 
EXCITED TO GET IN THE RACE 
THAT IS 
YOUR THIRD BRITISH RECORD IN A WEEK 
YOU WERE ON WORLD RECORD PACE 
TONIGHT IT COULD BE ON 
I DID NOT 
WANT TO KILL MYSELF THIS MORNING I 
JUST WANTED TO GO OUT AND SEE WHAT 
I COULD DO THERE WAS NO PRESSURE 
AND I AM SO PLEASED WITH MY RESULTS 
I THINK WE COULD SEE SOMETHING VERY 
SPECIAL HERE IN MANCHESTER TONIGHT 
SHE WAS 
SPECIAL HERE IN MANCHESTER TONIGHT SHE WAS 
PART OF THE ONE HUNDRED M. RELAY WHO 
SHE WAS PART OF THE ONE HUNDRED M. RELAY WHO WON GOLD AT THE EUROPEAN 
CHAMPIONSHIPS BUT THIS IS PROBABLY 
THE BIGGEST NIGHT IN TERMS OF 
INDIVIDUAL SWIMMING JESSICA 
DICKONS IS IN THERE FOR GREAT 
BRITAIN IT IS GOOD ATMOSPHERE TO STEP OUT INTO IT CERTAINLY IS WE HAVE TWO 
TEENAGERS REPRESENTING GREAT 
BRITAIN THEY HAVE QUALIFIED 
FASTEST AND THIRD FASTEST THAT IS 
WRYLY FROM THE U. S. A. BASED IN 
CALIFORNIA THE TWO BRITISH GIRLS IN THREE AND FOUR 
NEVER AT A WORLD SHORT COURSE 
CHAMPIONSHIP HAS BRITAIN EVER WON 
TWO MEDALS IN ONE RACE NEVER EVER 
NOT EITHER MEN OR WOMEN THESE 
MEDALS ARE UP FOR GRABS IT IS 
GOING TO BE TIGHT SHE WAS FOURTH TWO 
YEARS AGO AT THE WORLD SHORT COURSE 
JESSICA DICKONS SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD X. 
EUROPEAN JUNIOR CHAMPION ON TWO HUNDRED M. 
BUTTERFLY NOW JEMMA LOWE EIGHTEEN 
BRILLIANT LEG IN THE EUROPEAN 
CHAMPIONSHIPS BUT WHAT AN OLYMPIC 
TRIAL SHE HAD THE STUNNING SWIM 
FROM HER IT REALLY WAS BRILLIANT 
SHE IS GOOD AT LONG COURSE AND 
SHORT COURSE IF SHE CAN GET UNDER 
TWO MINUTES SHE HAS A GOOD CHANCE 
AT THE GOAL IT IS GOING TO BE 
TIGHT GOLD FINAL OF THE WOMEN'S TWO HUNDRED BUTTERFLY 
BIG PRESSURE SITUATION A SEVENTEEN YEAR 
OLD AND EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD FROM GREAT 
BRITAIN GOING IN FASTEST AND THIRD 
FASTEST IN THE FINAL VERY NERVOUS 
TIME SHE HAS GOT OUT QUICK YOU YOU HAVE GOT TO MANAGE THE NERVES ON 
SOMETHING SHE TALKED ABOUT IS THAT 
SHE ENJOYS RACING GETTING AMONGST 
THESE WOMEN THE FASTEST IN THE 
WORLD SHE IS TAKING THIS RACE TO 
THEM GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR A 
COUPLE OF MEDALS JEMMA LOWE HAVE 
TO MANAGE IT ALL SO FAR THE 
BRITISH HAVE NOT MANAGED THE 
PRESSURE WELL MAKING SMALL 
MISTAKES HOPEFULLY SHE WILL STICK 
TO THE RACE PACE IF YOU GET 
FOR GOING FOR IT 
JEMMA LOWE HAS A LOT OF POINTS IN 
THE BAG THIS IS A HALFWAY TURN 
SHE IS UNDERNEATH THE WORLD RECORD 
PACE BY HALF A SECOND SHE HAS GONE 
FOR IT 
SHE HAS GONE FOR IT AND I 
HOPE SHE CAN HOLD ON TO IT IT WILL 
BE NOTHING BETTER FOR A BRITISH 
CROWD TO SEEK A BRITISH SWIMMER 
GETTING A GOLD MEDAL THAT WAS A 
SLOW TURN JEMMA LOWE IS HOLDING ON 
TO IT 
THE AMERICAN IS COMING BACK 
COME ON JEMMA LOWE ALL STAR JESS 
DICKONS IN THREE IS STARTING TO 
MAKE A MOVE IT IS GOING TO BE TOUGH DOWN HIS 
LAST TWENTY FIVE METRES JEMMA LOWE HAS DONE 
JEMMA LOWE HAS DONE ALL WORK FOR THE WORLD RECORD THE 
JESS DICKONS IS COMING BACK VERY 
STRONGLY 
THIS IS GOING TO BE TOUGH STRONGLY THE AMERICAN IS WORLD CHAMPION

JESSICA DICKONS GETS THE BRONZE A 
GREAT RESULT FOR HER YOU HAVE GOT TO GIVE IT SUE JENNER 
LOW FOR GOING FOR IT BUT MAYBE SHE 
WENT TO QUICK

TALKING ABOUT JEMMA LOWE BUT JESS 
DICKONS HAS JUST TAKEN A TO BACK 
OFF HER

EIGHTEEN A LOT OF EXPERIENCE TO GO IN 
THE SHORT COURSE POOL SHE SWAM 
WELL 
SHE IS GOING TO HAVE TO CHALK WELL THIS UP TO EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE GOT 
TO LEARN YOU HAVE GOT TO GO OUT 
HARD AND LEARN HOW THE PACE IS SET 
IT IS A HARD PLACE TO FIND OUT AT 
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS WHEN YOU 
HAVE THE CHANCE OF A MEDAL AND YOU 
COME FORTH 
IT IS TOUGH I AGREE 
WITH YOU SHE CANNOT BELIEVE IT 
THAT RACE WAS WIDE OPEN IF YOU GO 
FOR IT THAT IS WHAT CAN HAPPEN A GOOD SWIM FROM BOTH OF THE 
BRITISH LADIES IT IS A NEW 
CHAMPIONSHIP RECORD AS WELL 
LOOKING AT THE START THINK JEMMA 
LOWE WENT STRAIGHT OFF VERY 
EXCITED SHE HAD DONE ALL THE HARD 
WORK THE AMERICAN TOOK OVER WHEN 
IT MATTERED SHE LOOKED ACROSS AND 
SHE KNEW SHE HAD IT JESSICA 
DICKONS MUST HAVE SEEN JEMMA LOWE 
TIRING AND SHE CAME BACK AND GOT 
THE BRONZE 
CONGRATULATIONS YOU KEPT GOING

SPECIALISMS THAT SUPPORT YOU AS A 
SWIMMER STRENGTH TRAINING POWER

WHAT YOU HAVE GOT TO DO TRY NOT TO 
BE DISTRACTED WHICHEVER RACE 
ARE IN THAT ELEMENT OF STAYING 
FOCUSED AND 
NOT BEING 
PUT OFF IS A 
CRITICAL PART OF THE 
TOOLKIT IF YOU LIKE IN THE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS OR OLYMPICS 
EVEN IF 
SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT HAPPENS IN A 
RACE BEFORE 
YOU YOU 
HAVE GOT TO 
SWITCH IT OFF AND THINK 
ABOUT WHAT
