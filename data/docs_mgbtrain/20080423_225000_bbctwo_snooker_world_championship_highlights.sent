LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PLEASE 
WELCOME YOUR REFEREES FOR TONIGHT 
SMASHING MATCHES PETER 
WILLIAMSON AND BRENDAN MALL 
TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD CHINESE SNOOKER STAR 
LIANG WENBO WAS QUICK OFF THE MARK 
HE WAS TOO QUICK HE FOLLOWED THE 
REFEREES OUT OF THE ARENA AND HAD 
TO DO A QUICK ABOUT TURN AND WAIT 
FOR HIS OFFICIAL INTRODUCTION 
ON TABLE NUMBER ONE HE'S HOT OFF 
THE MARK THE WORLD UNDER TWENTY ONE 
CHAMPION FROM TWO THOUSAND FIVE LIANG WENBO 
HE WAS VERY KEEN TO GET ON HIS 
MATCH WITH KEN DOHERTY HE BELONGS 
TO THE NEW GENERATION OF CHINESE 
SNOOKER PLAYERS EMERGING INTO THE 
TOP FLIGHT OF THE GAME ALONGSIDE 
HIS ENTHUSIASM THE YOUNGSTER HAS 
BAGS OF TALENT 
HIS CRUCIBLE DEBUT SAT WITH KEN 
DOHERTY'S VAST EXPERIENCE THE THIRTY EIGHT 
YEAR OLD FROM DUBLIN HAD ARRIVED IN 
SHEFFIELD FOR HIS SIXTEENTH WORLD 
CHAMPION CAMPAIGN HE HAS PLAYED 
HIM THREE WORLD CHAMPION 
CHAMPIONSHIP FINALS 
THIS YEAR STARTED BADLY A BAD 
START IN A BAD SEASON HE DROPPED 
OUT OF THE TOP SIXTEEN RANKINGS FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN FIFTEEN YEARS 
LIANG IS FOURTEEN POINTS AHEAD IN FRAME 
TWELVE COMMENTARY BY JOHN VIRGO AND 
DENNIS TAYLOR 
THAT IS ONE WAY HE COULD STUN ROUND 
HE HAS GONE RIGHT THE WAY AROUND 
BUT IT IS TOO HARD I THINK LES HE 
KISSES THE BROWN NO UNLESS HE 
KISSES THE BROWN 
LOOKING AT THAT PICTURE LOOKED AS 
IF THE BROWN WOULD GO TO THE CORNER 
POCKET 
HE HAS HIT THE BLUE HAS POCKET HE IT IS A FREE BALL 
THERE WAS 
PLENTY OF THE BROWN STICKING OUT 
THAT MUST JUST BE PURE TENSION 
JOHN 
HE HAS GOT TO MAKE KEN PLAY JOHN AGAIN FROM WHERE THE BALLS HAD 
LANDED 
LOOK AT THE SCORE BECAUSE LANDED IF KEN HE HAS TAKEN THE FREE 
BALL TWENTY TWO IS THE DIFFERENCE IF HE 
LETS KEN IN AGAIN KEN HAS TO HIT 
THE BROWN OTHERWISE THE FRAME IS 
OVER 
THAT WAS NOT THE RIGHT SHOT KEN 
DOHERTY HAS HAD LIFELINE HERE HE 
CAN NOW TIGHT 
CAN'T BELIEVE THAT 
CHOICE L. HONESTLY CAN'T BELIEVE 
THAT WHY TAKE THE BLUE ONE KEN 
WAS BANG IN TROUBLE OF THE BLUE 
ON L. CANNOT BELIEVE THAT LAST SHOT 
THAT IS YOUTH THE INEXPERIENCE OF 
YOUTH YOU SAW IT THERE IN 
NUTSHELL IF KEN CAN CLEAR UP NOW 
FORCED A RE SPOTTED BLACK THIS 
COULD BE BIG TURNING POINT IN THE 
MATCH YOU JUST FELL BY KEN NEEDED 
A BIT OF INSPIRATION FROM SOMEWHERE 
MAYBE LIANG HAS JUST GIVEN HIM THAT 
I CANNOT BELIEVE HE TOOK THIS ON 
HE WAS TWENTY TWO IN FRONT HE DECIDED TO 
TAKE THE BLUE ON BUT THAT IS ALL 
HISTORY AND HE HAS LOST THE TOSS 
SO HE HAS GOT TO BREAK OFF 
I THINK HE HAS GOT TO PLAY THIS 
BLACK TOWARDS THE TOP CUSHION 
ADVANTAGE KEN DOHERTY 
I THINK IT 
WOULD BE MORE FROM ADVANTAGE IF YOU 
GOT THE CUE BALL TIGHT TO THE BAULK 
CUSHION IF 
HE PLAYS WITH THERE IS CHANCE 
GET IN 
BEHIND THIS BLACK CUSHION FIRST 
WHERE DOES THE BLACK GO THOUGH 
IT IS PRETTY GOOD IF THE WHITE 
GOES AWAY FROM THE CUSHION KEN 
WILL TAKE IT ON 
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT SAFETY SHOT 
THAT IS BETTER ONE THAN THE LAST ONE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY SUPERB 
JUST OVER THIRTY SIX MINUTES FOR THIS TENTH 
TENSE TWELVE FRAME TENSE TWELFTH 
FRAME 
HE TOOK THE DOUBLE ON IT IS CLOSE 
BUT NOT CLOSE ENOUGH BUT HE HAS 
GOT IT SAFE 
YES THAT IS THE OTHER 
WAY WITH THAT SHOT IF YOU PLAY IT 
HARD ENOUGH SO IT DOESN'T GO IN THE 
POCKET BUT RUNNERS UP THE SIDE 
CUSHION THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT 
OH MY WORD IT HAS GONE IN OFF 
AND KEN DOHERTY HAS LOST THE FRAME 
EVERYBODY IS STUNNED LIANG WENBO 
IS NOW ONE FRAME AWAY FROM VICTORY 
HE LEADS NINE TO THREE WHAT A SICKENER FOR 
THE DUBLINER 
KEN DOHERTY BREAKS OFF IN FRAME THIRTEEN 
THE LAST SESSION BEFORE THE MID 
SESSION INTERVAL SORRY THE LAST 
FRAME BEFORE THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL WHAT HAS HE GOT LEFT IN 
THE TANK AFTER THE WAY HE LOST THE 
LAST FRAME YOU WOULD NOT THINK A 
LOT DENNIS 
NO THAT WAS A BIG 
BODY BLOW EIGHT TO FOUR WITH WHAT WENT ON IN 
THAT FRAME THINK IT WOULD HAVE 
GIVEN THE AND CHINESE PLAYER 
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT 
BUT HE 
CAN RELAX A LITTLE BIT NOW 
A LITTLE BIT TOO PACY A BIT OF VALUE HERE RUNNING IN 
BEHIND THE GREEN AND BLOCKING THE 
PATH OFF FOR THE REDS DOWN THE 
RIGHT SIDE OF THE TABLE IS HE 
LOOKING AT THE CUT ON THE GREEN 
HERE THAT LOOKS A VERY THIN ONE 
THE WHITE IS PAST THE BAULK LINE 
AND THE GREEN IS SLIGHTLY OFF ITS 
SPOT BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE 
THINNEST SNICKS 
HOW UNLUCKY IS THAT BUT WHAT A 
SHOT HE HAS TAKEN ON THERE THAT 
WAS SO THIN 
TAKING THESE QUITE WELL IS KEN I 
DON'T THINK THE BLACK IS AVAILABLE 
HE WILL HAVE TO KEEP CONCENTRATING 
ON THE PINK 
HE MUST BE ABSOLUTELY GUTTED AFTER 
LOSING THE LAST FRAME AWAY HE LOST 
IT THE WAY HE LOST IT BUT 
CONSUMMATE PROFESSIONAL THAT HE IS 
HE HAS COME OUT JUST PRIDE THOUGH 
ONCE YOU GET PAST THE INTERVAL 
ABSOLUTELY JOHN AND HE WILL NEVER 
GIVE UP KEN DOHERTY THAT IS ONE 
THING ABOUT THIS PLAYER AND YOU 
JUST NEVER KNOW WHAT THIS GAME IT 
IS THE YOUNG CHINESE PLAYER'S FIRST 
TIME AT THE CRUCIBLE WE ALWAYS SAY 
A FRAME THAT TAKES YOU OVER THE 
LINE IS THE TOUGHEST ONE TO WIN SO 
KEN WOULD 
HAVE 
THAT IN 
THE BACK OF 
HIS MIND ALSO HE MIGHT JUST LOOSEN 
UP A LITTLE BIT HERE THE FACT HE 
IS SO FAR BEHIND AND WE WILL SEE 
THE REAL KEN DOHERTY 
THE FRAME IS AT HIS MERCY NOW HE 
STARTED THE EVENING SEVEN TWO 
BEHIND YOU HAVE TO BE FAIR HE 
COULD HAVE WON EVERY FRAME STILL 
GOT IT ALL TO DO BUT THIS IS MORE 
LIKE THE FORM 
THAT YOU 
WOULD NEED 
TO CLOSE A GAP LIKE HE HAS GOT AND AND PLAYING VERY QUICKLY AS WELL L. THINK HE JUST WANTS TO GET TO THE 
MID SESSION INTERVAL 
THAT 
AND TRY 
I THINK 
ABOUT 
THE TASK 
THAT HE IS GOING TO BE FACED WITH 
AND PLAN HIS WAY TO POSSIBLY MAKING 
AN UNBELIEVABLE COMEBACK 
IT HAS 
NOT BEEN DONE VERY OFTEN BUT IT 
HAS BEEN DONE 
THAT WAS MORE LIKE IT FROM KEN 
DOHERTY IS IT TOO LITTLE TOO LATE 
LIANG WENBO GOES TO THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL LEADING NINE TO FOUR FOR STOP SO ON 
TO FRAME FOURTEEN 
KEN IN SEARCH OF MIRACLE LIANG IS AT THE TABLE 
YOU CAN'T KEEP LEAVING THE YOUNG 
PLAYER IN O. K. IT IS THE FRAME THAT 
WILL TAKE HIM INTO THE SECOND ROUND 
AND IT WILL BE FAMOUS VICTORY 
BUT THERE WILL BE A CERTAIN AMOUNT 
OF 
PRESSURE ON 
THE YOUNG 
MAN EVEN 
THOUGH HE LEADS BY FIVE FRAMES 
THE FIVE REDS ABOUND THE PINK SPOT 
OF ALL COVERING EACH OTHER A LOOK 
AT THE OTHER FOUR REDS TO ON 
EITHER SIDE CUSHION HE IS TAKING 
THE PINK THAT IS IT BETTER ANGLE 
TO DISTURB THE REDS OR AT LEAST 
ONE OF THEM 
OH AND IT IS GETTING A LITTLE BIT 
EDGY FOR THE YOUNG PLAYER HE CAN 
SEE THE WINNING LINE 
NOW THEN NICE SPLIT ON THE FOUR 
REDS 
THAT'S O. K. IF HE CAN SEE THIS RED 
THE OTHERS HAVE OPENED UP 
HE DOES NOT WANT TO BE TOO STRAIGHT 
ON THIS BLACK HE DOES NOT WANT TO 
SCREW INTO THE RED ON THE RIGHT 
HAND CUSHION 
A BIT CLOSER TO THE CUSHION THAN HE 
WOULD LIKE 
HE PLAYED THE STUN RUN THROUGH AND 
MADE THE POT THAT LITTLE BIT EASIER 
IT IS HANDY KNOCKING THIS RED OFF 
HE COULD ROLL IT IN AND GET 
POSITION ON THE COLOUR AND THE RED 
HE'S EASY HE WAS UP STRAIGHT AWAY 
I THINK HE GOT A TERRIBLE KICK 
THERE LOOK WHERE THE WHITE HAS 
FINISHED JOHN 
NOT HAVING THE CUE 
BALL CLEANED YOU WILL PROBABLY 
RIGHT DENNIS YOU WILL PROBABLY 
RIGHT YOU WILL PROBABLY 
HE CERTAINLY LOOKS VERY EDGY HE 
HAS HAD A FEW CHANCES THAT ONE HE 
WASN'T ANYWHERE NEAR THE POCKET 
IF HE PLAYS THE PINK AND ONE MORE 
RED IF HE PLAYS THE BLUE WHO 
WANTS ONE MORE RED AND A COLOUR 
HE WANTS ONE MORE RED AND A COLOUR 
SUPERB SHOT CONTROLLED CAN AND 
THIS IS THE FRAME HE NEEDS 
CANNON 
SLOWLY BUT SURELY HE IT'S CALLING 
HIS WAY BACK INTO THIS MATCH 
HE IS THINKING ABOUT COMING TO THE 
TABLE BUT APPARENT SNOOKERS THE 
DUBLIN THERE HAS PULLED ONE BACK 
COULD HE KEEP IT GOING IN FRAME FIFTEEN 
HE IS WELL BEHIND 
HE IS USUALLY GOOD AT SAFETY PLAY 
KING BUT THAT WAS POOR KIN 
KEN 
I THINK HE IS O. K. IF YOU HIT KEN THE BLACK AND RED AT THE SAME THING 
I THINK HE WILL JUST CATCH THE 
BLACK FROST FIRST 
IT IS IMPORTANT ROUTE TO POT THIS 
RED AND PLAY FOR THE PINK TO THE 
MIDDLE 
THAT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY INCH PERFECT 
HE CAN BRING THE TWO REDS INTO PLAY 
AND THE BLACK 
THAT IS UNLUCKY IT 
HAS TIED THE BLACK UP 
FORTY POINTS THE DIFFERENCE COULD BE 
TEMPTED BY THIS RED INTO THE FAR 
RIGHT HAND CORNER HE WILL BE ON 
THE PINK IF IT GOES IN POINTS ON 
THE BOARD AT THE MOMENT FOR KEN HE 
TRIED TO GET ON THE BLACK DENNIS 
THAT IS THE SORT OF SHOT THAT IS O. K. 
IF YOU ARE LEADING NINE TO FIVE 
KEN WAS VERY AMBITIOUS TO GET ON 
THE BLACK OFF THERE DIFFICULT RED 
HE WANTED TO FINISH STRAIGHT ON THE 
BLACK AND HE COULD HAVE BEEN 
STRAIGHT ON THE RED WHEN HE POTTED 
THE BLACK BUT UNDER THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES THE WRONG CHOICE 
HE MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO SLIP PAST 
THIS RED OFF TWO CUSHIONS AND LEAVE 
IT ON WELL AND A MISS LIANG WENBO FOUR 
HE WOULD NEED THE SPIDER TO PLAY 
THAT WE HAVE THE TOP CUSHION L. 
THINK HE HAS PUT IT THIS TIME 
SURELY WELL DONE 
HE CANNOT AFFORD TO GIVE SO MANY 
POINTS AWAY WITH MISSES 
MUCH TOO THIN AND VERY FORTUNATE 
NOT TO LEAVE THIS RED VERY 
FORTUNATE IN THE FIRST SESSION I 
SAW THREE OR FOUR FRAMES WHEN LIANG 
WENBO DID HAVE THE RUN OF THE BALLS 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY THEY HAVE 
BOTH HAD SOMETHING OF THE RUN OF 
THE BALL IT HAS ONLY BEEN EXCITING 
BECAUSE OF IS HE GOING TO NEED THE 
COMEBACK KEN DOHERTY IF YOU WERE 
GOING TO GIVE THESE PLAYERS MARKET 
OF TEN THEY WOULD NOT BE THAT GOOD 
MARK'S OUT OF TEN 
TERRIFIC POT HE WAS ALWAYS GOING 
TO BE ON THE BLACK AND YET AGAIN 
WE HAVE ANOTHER LEFT HANDER WHO IS 
A TERRIFIC POTTER 
THE LIST GOES ON OF LEFT HANDED 
POTTERS 
HE'S FIFTY TWO IN FRONT LOW AND POTTERS THERE IS ONLY FIFTY ONE REMAINING KEN 
DOHERTY NEEDS A SNOOKER IF HE IS TO 
STAY ALIVE IN THIS MATCH 
THREE MINUTES LATER IT WAS ALL OVER 
A GREAT VICTORY FOR LIANG ON HIS 
CRUCIBLE DEBUT KINDLE HEARTY SLIPS 
OUT OF THE TOP SIXTEEN IN THE WORLD 
RANKINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIFTEEN 
YEARS KING DOHERTY 
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING 
AND PLAYING WELL BUT I HAVE WROTE 
GOT THE RESULTS THIS SEASON L. 
DON'T KNOW WHERE IT HAS ALL GOING 
WRONG TO BE HONEST COUPLE YEARS 
AGO I WAS AT THE TOP OF THE 
RANKINGS AND NOW I 
AM DOWN AT SIXTEEN L. AM DUMBSTRUCK TO BE HONEST IT IS 
DISAPPOINTING TO LOSE IN THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING 
FORWARD TO IT SO MUCH AND DEVIANT 
UP FOR IT IT WILL BE DEVINE UP 
FOR IT IT WILL BE UP TO WATCH 
DEALING GEARING 
GRAEME DOTT HAS

MORE BACK TO NORMAL THERE AND I 
HAVE BEEN 
THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE CHAMPION THE 
SURE MURPHY ROUNDED OFF A 
COMFORTABLE TEN TO THREE VICTORY OVER 
STOKE'S DAVE HAROLD 
I AM PLEASED 
TO HAVE PLAYED WELL NOT TOO 
BOTHERED ABOUT WHAT EVERYONE ELSE 
HAS DOING IT HAS BEEN INTERESTING 
WATCHING EVERYONE ELSE WHICH FOR 
FOR THESE WIN I HAVE BEEN SAT AT 
HOME WATCHING IT NOT REALLY 
FEELING PART OF IT SO IT 
IS GOOD 
TO BE PART OF IT NOW 
LIU CHENG 
TRAILS RONNIE O'SULLIVAN FIVE TO FOUR 
TRAILING GOING INTO THE SECOND 
SESSION OF THAT MATCH EVIDENCE OF 
ANOTHER CHINESE PLAYER PERFORMING 
WELL ON HIS CHINESE DEBUT ACTION 
NOW FROM THE FIRST ROUND MATCH 
BETWEEN STEPHEN MAGUIRE AND ANTHONY 
HAMILTON 
ANTHONY HAMILTON HAS PLAYED IN FOUR 
CRUCIBLE QUARTER FINALS BUT AT THIS 
SEASON'S MAJOR TOURNAMENTS THINGS 
HAVE NOT GOING WELL THINGS HAVE 
GONE FROM BAD TO WORSE FOR ANTHONY 
STEPHEN IS THREE TO ZERO UP 
IF HE GETS THIS HE COULD FINISH ON 
THE BLACK THAT IS BEAUTY 
JUST A TOUCH OF LEFT HAND SIDE TO 
GET HIS WAY ROUND THE TWO REDS YOU 
CANNOT FAULT THAT SHOT 
NOT PERFECT HE HAS JUST GOT 
PLAY A LITTLE SCREW SHOT FOR 
POSITION THERE ARE LIP REDS 
LINED UP INTO THE LEFT HAND CORNER 
HE HAS PLAYED PRETTY SOLIDLY SO FAR 
HE LOST THE FIRST FRAME AND HAD 
FRAME BALL ON THE BLUE A 
COMFORTABLE WHEN THAT HE MISSED 
ONE 
NOTHING BUILD YOUR CONFIDENCE ONE MORE THAN SEEING YOUR OPPONENT 
STRUGGLE SINCE MISSING THAT BLUE 
ANTHONY SEEMS TO HAVE LOST HIS WAY 
FOR A FEW FOR MOMENTS 
I THINK HE CAN AVOID THAT KISS ON 
THE 
CUSHION HE IS TRYING TO FLOAT 
THE CUSHION HE IS TRYING TO FLOAT IT ROUND TWO CUSHIONS FOR THE RED 
TO THE SAME POCKET BOTH A PLAYERS 
STRUGGLING WITH THAT BACK CUSHION 
HAS GONE TWO F. T. HIGHER THAN YOU 
WOULD EXPECT 
VERY GOOD RECOVERY MOST PLAYERS 
ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE REST BUT 
IT IS TOUGH TO POT BALLS 
DECENT SHOT HE MANAGED TO AVOID 
THE BROWN HE DIRECTED IT SO WELL 
HE WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE ON ONE 
BECAUSE OF THE ANGLE HE HAS HE WILL 
PROBABLY HAVE TO PLAY THE CANNON ON 
THE THREE REDS IN THE MIDDLE 
THERE ARE SIX REDS LEFT SEVENTY FIVE LEFT ON 
THE TABLE WITH THE RED BLACK 
SANDAL COLOURS THIS WILL BE FRAME 
BALL THERE IS CHANCE OF A BREAK 
BUT I DO NOT THINK HE WILL BE 
LOOKING BEYOND THIS RED WHICH WILL 
CHALK UP HIS FOURTH FRAME IN ROLE ROW 
VERY CLEVER SHOT SECURES HIS FOURTH 
FRAME BREAKS OF FORTY THREE AND FORTY TWO IN THE 
FIRST NOTHING OF ANY SIGNIFICANCE 
IN THE THIRD BUT THIS BREAK HAS 
BEEN COMPILED REALLY WELL 
ANTHONY HAMILTON REALISES THAT HIS 
FRAME IS OVER STEPHEN MAGUIRE THE 
WORLD NUMBER THREE GOES INTO THE 
INTERVAL WINNING FOUR ZERO THE SCORE 
MOVED ONTO EIGHT ZERO WHITE WASH A 
LAYER IN FRAME NINE AND THAT HE 
IS ON A BREAK OF FORTY WHITEWASH A 
LOOKED ALERT 
HE MADE HAVE TO PLEA A LITTLE KISS 
HERE TO JUST HOLD ON TO THE CUE 
BALL HE MIGHT HAVE TO PLAY THAT 
WAS A POOR SHOT HE IS UNLUCKY TO 
HAVE SNOOKERED HIMSELF BUT THE CUE 
BALL SEEMED TO BE RUNNING FREE 
THERE ANTHONY HAMILTON FORTY EIGHT 
A GOOD BREAK OFF A FORTY EIGHT HE WAS 
UNLUCKY TO END UP SO CLOSE TO THE 
PINK 
THAT WAS ONE OF THE FEW LONG POTS 
HE HAS MISSED HE HAS BEEN VERY 
CONSISTENT WITH THOSE 
THREE OR REDS THREE WORE COLOURS 
AND ANTHONY HAMILTON CAN GET HIS 
FIRST FRAME ON THE BOARD 
IF HE COULD POT A BLACK OFF THE 
NEXT RED THAT WOULD BE OF A WISE 
HE WILL NEED TWO REDS OTHER WISE 
HE IS VERY CLOSE TO GETTING THAT 
FRAME ON THE BOLD NOW AND YOU 
WOULD NOT BEGRUDGE ANTHONY THAT 
FRAME HE CAME HERE WITH HOPES OF 
DOING WELL AT SHEFFIELD BUT HE HAS 
BEEN THOROUGHLY OUTPLAYED TONIGHT 
EVEN AT EIGHT TO ONE IT IS PROBABLY TOO FAR 
TO COME BACK FROM WHEN THE MATCH 
RESUMES TOMORROW BUT AT LEAST THE 
WHITEWASH HAS BEEN AVERTED STEPHEN STEPHEN MAGUIRE HAS PLAYED VERY WELL 
ANTHONY HAMILTON HAS AVOIDED A 
WHITEWASH 
THE FINAL SESSION MIGHT NOT TAKE 
TOO LONG ANTHONY HAMILTON HAD HAS 
NIGHT THERE BEFORE HE WENT TO BED 
TONIGHT WE HAVE A SNOOKER EXTRA 
PROGRAMME COMING UP FEATURING 
GRAEME DOTT VERSUS JOE PERRY AND 
TOMORROW THE FINAL SESSION OF THE 
MATCH BETWEEN RONNIE O'SULLIVAN AND
