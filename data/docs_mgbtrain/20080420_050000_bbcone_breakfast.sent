ONE MILLION PUPILS FAILED BY LABOUR 
EXAM POLICY EFFECTIVELY A LOST 
AGAIN WAITION OF YOUNGSTERS TAKE 
THE GCSE'S 
THEY ARE TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT 
THEIR SEX LIVES AND EARNINGS YOU 
MAY REMEMBER A STORY WE HAD ABOUT A 
WOMAN WHO WAS BORN A WOMAN BECAME 
A MAN THEN DECIDED TO HAVE A BABY 
ANY WAY RATHER CONFUSINGLY THIS 
PICTURE THE SUN EXPRESS HAS PICKED 
UP IS OF A MAN BORN A WOMAN AND 
BECAME A MAN AND HAD A BABY TEN 
YEARS AGO WHOSE DAUGHTER IS NOW 
TEN YEARS OLD THIS IS A PICTURE OF 
HIM HOLDING HIS BABY THE CHILD IS 
NOW TEN YEARS OLD HE IS SAYING IT 
IS POSSIBLE TO DO THESE THINGS THE 
SUN TELEGRAPH HAS AN EXCLUSIVE 
INTERVIEW WITH MAX MOSLEY HE HAS 
DEFENDED HIS VIEW TO HAVE AN 
ECCENTRIC PRIVATE LIFE AND SAYS IT 
WOULD HAVE NO EFFECT ON HIS ABILITY 
TO RUN FORMULA ONE THE EARLY 
ADDITIONS DON'T HAVE THE JOHN 
PRESCOTT STORY IN IT THIS IS THE 
STORY OF GORDON BROWN THIS IS HIM 
STEPPING OFF THE PLANE FROM HIS 
TRIP TO AMERICA AND THE ON GOING 
PROBLEMS WITH THE TEN P. RATE OF TAX 
THAT STORY OF PRINCE WILLIAM 
LANDING HIS R. A. F. HELICOPTER IN KATE 
MIDDLETON'S BACK GARDEN IT MIGHT 
BE A BIT EARLY IN THE MORNING BUT 
HOW DO YOU FANCY A CHICKEN TIKKA TO 
GO WITH A PORTION OF RICE 
IF YOU WANT THE DISH TO TASTE THE 
SAME WHEREVER YOU GO YOU WILL SOON 
BE ABLE TO STEP INTO A CHAIN OF 
INDIAN RESTAURANTS WHICH IS OPENING 
UP 
INDIAN RESTAURANTS WHICH IS OPENING UP WHETHER IT IS COFFEE FROM CAFFE 
NERO A TREAT FROM THOR TONNES OR A 
BURGER FROM BURGER KING WHEN IT 
COMES TO THE HIGH STREET IT IS 
CRAMMED WITH FRANCHISES NO ONE HAS 
OPENED A CHAIN OF INDIAN 
RESTAURANTS UNTIL NOW TIFFIN BITES 
HOPES TO CREATE FRANCHISES 
THROUGHOUT BRITAIN FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
PLUS A SHARE OF PROFITS FRANCHISEES 
GET FOOD 
WE ARE HEADING FOR YOUNG 
ENTREPRENEURS WHO WANT TO SEE AN 
OPTION FOR THEM TO GET INTO THE 
INDIAN FOOD INDUSTRY RATHER THAN 
THEM TAKING ON A FAMILY RUN 
SCENARIO THEY COULD HAVE A BACKED 
FRANCHISE WHICH THEY WOULD BUILD UP 
INTO TWO OR THREE DEPENDING ON HOW 
KEEN OR HUNGRY THEY ARE WILL WILL LOSING THAT FAMILY RUN FEEL BE A 
RECIPE FOR PROBLEMS 
ONE OF THE 
DOWN SIDES IS MOST FAMILY 
RESTAURANTS ARE FAMILY RUN 
BUSINESSES OFFER AUTHENIC RECIPES 
FROM THE MENUS ONE THING YOU LOSE 
IS THAT SENSE SO IT BECOMES MORE 
IMPERSONAL WHEN IT IS IN DIFFERENT 
OUTLETS YOU LOSE ORIGINALITY AND 
THAT SIDE OF THINGS 
THE CONCEPT OF 
FRANCHISING INDIAN RESTAURANTS HAS 
COME A LONG WAY IN F. R. THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND 
NINETEEN SIXTIES WHEN THE FIRST WAVE OF 
IMMIGRANTS STARTED A NEW TYPE OF 
DINING THE GOVERNMENT IS CLAMPING 
DOWN ON ALL NON E. U. IMMIGRATION 
THAT COULD MAKE IT TOUGHER FOR 
INDIAN RESTAURANTS TO GET THE 
QUALIFIED CHEFS THEY NEED LET US 
KNOW WHAT YOU THINK AFTER SEVEN OH 
CLOCKAM WE WILL ASK JENNIFER JOYCE 
WHETHER SHE THINKS THAT WE WILL ALL 
BE HUNGRY FOR THIS TWO AND A HALF 
YEARS AGO NEW ORLEANS WAS 
DEVASTATED BY HURRICANE KATRINA 
MATT FREI WHO COVERED THE STORY 
FOR US HAS GONE BACK TO SEE IF THE 
WOUNDS HAVE HEELED 
TWO AND A HALF YEARS AFTER 
HURRICANE KATRINA HIT NEW ORLEANS 
MATT FREI FINDS THOUSANDS WANT TO 
RETURN BUT THERE ARE NO HOMES FOR 
THEM HELLO WELCOME TO REPORTERS 
BEFORE HURRICANE KATRINA NEW 
ORLEANS WAS KNOWN AS THE BIG EASY 
FAMOUS FOR ITS GREAT JAZZ WHEN THE 
LEVYS BROKE MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE 
DIED MANY OF THEM AFRICAN 
AMERICANS TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO 
MATT FREI WATCHED AS ONE OF THE 
GREAT CITIES BECAME A WATER LOGGED 
GRAVEYARD NOW HE HAS FOUND NEW 
ORLEANS TRYING TO REINVENT ITSELF 
WHILE MANY OF THOSE WANTING TO GO 
HOME HAVE NOWHERE TO GO TO 
IT IS APRIL IN NEW ORLEANS A 
PERFECT TIME TO VISIT THE SPRING 
FIESTA ORGANISATION HAS PULLED OUT 
ALL THE STOPS THE BIG EASY LIVES 
OFF TOURISM THAT MEANS DEPENDING 
ON AN IMAGE AN IMMAIPLG THEY HAVE 
NURTURED AND GARNERED FOR OVER FIFTY 
YEARS PARADES DOWN THE STREET 
THRONG THRONGS OF TOURISTS IT IS 
WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM THE BIG EASY 
CLEARLY BACK ON FANTASTIC FORM OR 
IS IT 
NO ONE WHO WAS IN NEW ORLEANS 
DURING THE AFTERMATH OF THE 
HURRICANE WILL EVER FORGET WHAT 
THEY SAW ONE OF AMERICA'S GREAT 
CITIES DROWNING IN THE WATERS THAT 
SURROUNDED IT THE FLOOD FIRST 
RENDERED TWO THIRDS OF NEW ORLEANS 
UNINHABITABLE THEN IMPOSED SEARING 
IMAGES OF POVERTY AND DISTRUST 
BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE AMERICA IT 
WAS AN UGLY SIGHT WHICH THE CITY 
BOSSES DESPERATELY HOPE THE WORLD 
HAS FORGOTTEN JUST A FEW BLOCKS 
OFF THE TOURIST TRACK THERE ARE NEW 
SIGNS OF ABANDONMENT VERY FEW 
TOURISTS EVER LEAVE THE FRENCH 
QUARTER BUT IF THEY DID THEY 
WOULD FIND THIS LESS THAN HALF A 
MILE AWAY NEW OR LEAN'S HOMELESS 
POPULATION HAS DOUBLED TO TWELVE THOUSAND 
SINCE KATRINA SUCH ARE THE NUMBERS 
THAT THE COUNCIL WILL SOON VOTE 
WHETHER TO MAKE SLEEPING OUTSIDE 
ILLEGAL 
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE ILLEGAL TO BE IN THE SHELTER IT IS LIKE A 
JAIL HOUSE PEOPLE MOVE ON FROM ONE 
BRIDGE TO ANOTHER 
THIS MAN WORKS 
ON A CONSTRUCTION SITE BUT SAYS HE 
CANNOT EARN ENOUGH TO RENT A PLACE 
RENTS ARE TOO HIGH THIS IS WHAT 
HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE 
LEVYS BROKE THE FLOOD DISPLACED 
MORE THAN ONE MILLION PEOPLE TODAY 
THE CITY IS BACK TO THREE QUARTERS 
ITS ORIGINAL SIZE ONLY HALF OF THE 
POOREST RES RESIDENTS HAVE RETURNED 
SOME SUSPECT A CONSPIRACY TO STOP 
POOR AMERICANS COMING BACK TO NEW 
ORLEANS ONE OF FOUR HOUSING 
PROJECTS HERE WAS PUT UP FOR 
DEMOLITION 
IT MEANS AFTER THE DEMOLITION STORM THEY COULD HAVE REOPENED 
THESE BUILDINGS AND MOVED PEOPLE 
BACK IN IT IS WHAT FRUSTRATES 
PEOPLE SO MUCH TO DESTROY THE 
HISTORIC LANDSCAPE TO LOSE OUT ON 
IMPORTANT AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL MANDATE NOT 
BECAUSE THESE BUILDINGS WERE 
DAMAGED IT IS A PROBLEM 
THE DEMOLITION SQUADS AND 
BULLDOZERS ARE BEING A FIELD DAY IN 
NEW ORLEANS HERE THEY ARE MUNCHING 
AWAY AT A HOUSING PROJECT ANOTHER 
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ONCE HOME TO 
MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND FAMILIES THE PLANS 
TO RENDER THIS RUBBLE AND START 
AFRESH WERE APPROVED BY DEMOCRATS 
AND REPUBLICANS THEY ARE THE 
CENTRE PIECE OF A VISION TO 
REINVENT POOR NEW ORLEANS FROM 
STRACH EVEN THE POOR GET ATTACHED 
TO THEIR HOMES THIS WOMAN LIVED IN 
THE MAGNOLIA PROJECT FOR FORTY TWO YEARS 
THE NEW HOUSES WERE COMFORTABLE 
BUT SHE MISSES HER OLD COMMUNITY 
SO MUCH SO THAT SHE HAS KEPT THE 
BRICK WITH HER OLD HOUSE NUMBER 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS EVERYBODY IN 
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD KNEW EACH OTHER 
EVERYONE LOOKED OUT FOR EACH OTHER 
MOST OF HER FORMER NEIGHBOURS ARE 
DISPERSED IN TRAILER PARKS AND 
OTHER PARTS OF NEW ORLEANS SHE 
BELIEVES MOST WILL NEVER BE INVITED 
TO COME BACK TO MAGNOLIA EVEN WHEN 
IT IS REBUILT 
THEY SAY WE HAVE THE 
RIGHT TO RETURN BUT WE WILL NOT 
HAVE ENOUGH UNION NILTS FOR PEOPLE 
THEY ARE USING KATRINA AS AN EXCUSE 
TO GET RID OF US 
PLANS TO DEMOLISH 
THE PROJECTS HAD BEEN IN THE 
PIPELINES FOR YEARS EVEN BEFORE 
KATRINA 
KATRINA MOVED THAT FORWARD KATRINA PROBABLY FIVE TO TEN YEARS 
CAN I 
TELL YOU THE NUMBER OF AFRICAN 
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO ARE CONVINCED 
IT IS PART OF A CONSPIRACY TO GET 
RID OF THEM 
WELL THERE ARE PEOPLE 
WHO ARE UNEDUCATED ON A LOT OF THE 
ISSUES WHO BELIEVE THE LEVYS WERE 
BLOWN UP THAT CRACK COCAINE WAS 
THE WHITE MAN'S PLOY TO BRING DOWN 
THE AFRICAN COMMUNITY WE HAVE TO 
WAIT ANOTHER TWO YEARS TO SEE THE 
QUALITY OF HOUSES THE QUALITY 
PLACES TO LIVE 
RIVER GARDEN FOR 
ONCE A COMMUNITY LIVING UP TO ITS 
ALLURING NAME THIS IS THE MODEL 
FOR URBAN PLANNING THIS IS HOW 
THEY WANT IT TO BE MORE WISTERIA 
LANE THAN CRACK ALLY THEY STARTED 
BUILDING THIS PLACE EVEN BEFORE 
KATRINA ON THE SITE OF THE SAINT 
THOMAS PROJECT TODAY THE LUCKY 
RESIDENTS FACE BACKGROUND CHECKS 
AND A ONE STRIKE RULE DRACONIAN 
STUFF BUT IT HAS MADE LIVING HERE 
SAFER ACCORDING TO THIS WOMAN SHE 
HAS SWAPPED LIFE ON A PROJECT WHERE 
THE POLICE WERE TOO SCARED TO SET 
FOOLT TO A SUSS SIZED APARTMENT 
SUITABLE FOR THE FIRE CHIEF TO LIVE 
ON 
YOU BLEND IN WITH EVERYBODY ON ELSE THERE IS NO SEPARATION TO 
COME OUT OF THAT PROJECT TO GET 
OUT OF THAT MENALTY OF NOT PAYING 
UTILITIES PAYING THE WATER BILL 
STEP OUT L. DID L. AM SURE THEY 
COULD DO THE SAME 
RIVER GARDEN 
SEEMS LIKE A PLEASANT PLACE TO LIVE 
TODAY THEY ARE STILL BUSY BUILDING 
THESE HOUSES WILL SOON BE OWNER 
OCCUPIED THAT IS THE PROBLEM 
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ROOM TO 
ACCOMMODATE ALL THE LOW INCOME 
FAMILYS WHO ONCE LIVED ON 
SUBSIDISED RENTS IN THIS 
NEIGHBOURHOOD ADD TO THAT A 
DECLINING ECONOMY AND A HOUSING 
MARKET IN PERIL AND WHAT YOU GET 
ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WITHOUT 
ROOFS OVER THEIR HEADS 
THERE IS A 
BATTLE TO FIND HOUSING AND IT MAKES 
THICKS 
TOUGH PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
LIMITED RESOURCES ARE FEARING THE 
WORSE 
HERE IS THE QUESTION HOW WORSE COME THE WORLD'S RICHEST NATION IS 
UNABLE TO FIX THIS PROBLEM CORE 
RON NET COURT THE WEEDS NOW CALL 
THIS PLACE HOME AS WE WERE ABLE TO 
LEAVE WE CAME ACROSS ONE REPS DENT 
FLAT ON HIS BACK ONE RESIDENT 
FLAT ON HIS BACK HE IS DETERMINED 
TO FIX HIS LIFE MUCH LIKE THE REST 
OF NEW ORLEANS HE THINKS HE KNOWS 
WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN 
IN AMERICA 
EVERYTHING NEEDS MONEY 
TO WORK AS FAR AS WE GET THE MONEY 
WE NEED WE 
WILL BE ALL RIGHT IT WILL BE THE WAY IT WAS SOME SOME RESIDENTS ARE COMING BACK IT IS 
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHO IS 
HELPING THEM IN A VERY AMERICAN 
WAY THE SCHEME IS NICKNAMED THE 
ROAD TO SELF SUFFICIENTLY GUY 
YOU COULD NOT MEET A NICER PERSON 
AFTER THE DISASTER HE RUNS A 
HOUSING PROGRAMME RESPONSIBLE FOR 
GETTING NINE THOUSAND FAMILIES HERE IN NEW 
ORLEANS BACK UNDER A ROOF AND ON 
THEIR FEET 
ON A NEW OR LEAN'S 
SALARY THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT MAKING 
THIS SORT OF SALARY 
EACH MONTH 
THEY HAVE TO PAY MORE AND MORE 
TOWARDS THEIR RENT SOUND LIKE A 
GOOD IDEA BUT THERE ARE DANGERS 
THIRTY THOUSAND TRAILERS THAT ARE SUPPORTING 
OR SERVING AS HOUSING IN THE REGION 
THEY ARE HOLDING FAMILIES TOGETHER 
ONCE PEOPLE COME OUT OF TRAILERS 
THERE'LL BE A SERIOUS LACK OF 
AFFORDABLE HOUSES 
BY THE END OF 
MAY EVERYONE AN ESTIMATED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR 
TRAILERS WE MEET THE MOON FAMILY 
AS THEY WERE PACKING UP 
I AM JUST 
TIRED OF THIS THIS IS LIKE A SHOE 
BOX 
THIS WOMAN IS HEAVILY PREGNANT BOX AND ABOUT TO GO ON MATERNITY LEAVE 
SHE IS QUITTING HER TRAILER EARLY 
AND WILLINGLY THIS MEANS SHE GET A 
HOUSE COURTESY FOR THE MOMENT FROM 
THE GOVERNMENT 
IF I GET THIS NEW 
HOUSE WE WILL BE O. K. WE ALL WILL BE 
O. K. 
CRITICS CLAIM BY LETTING THE O. K. MARKET DICTATES WHICH 
NEIGHBOURHOODS LIVE AND DIE THE 
BIG EASY COULD LOSE ITS SOUL 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
WANT TO COME HOME WE ARE TELLING 
THEM WE DON'T KNOW GOOD LUCK TRY 
IT ON YOUR OWN THERE IS 
DISINGENUOUSNESS OF THE U. S. POLICY 
TOWARDS POOR PEOPLE 
EVERY CRISIS 
IS AN OPPORTUNITY EVEN IN NEW 
ORLEANS THE VISION OF A NEW CITY 
RISE FROM THE DAMP IS A NEW PROCESS 
PLENTY OF GOODWILL AND RESILIENCE

RECOVERED TO WIN IT WAS FABULOUS 
STUFF STUFF SUPERB THIS WAS CALZAGHE FIRST 
BOUT IN AMERICA THAT IS THE FIRST 
ROUND KNOCK DOWN HE IS 
CONSIDERABLE YOUNGER THAN BERNARD 
HOP KENS HOPKINS IS FORTY THREE KNOWN AS 
THE EXECUTIONER MAYBE NOT ANY MORE 
CALZAGHE STEPPED UP THE PACE IN THE 
LAST FOUR OR FIVE ROUNDS AND GOT AT 
SPLIT DECISION BAIRG IN MIND THERE

WATCHING THAT BOUT THAT WAS A 
CRACKING WIN FOR CALZAGHE HE STILL

WAY JOE CALZAGHE WON THAT LIGHT 
HEAVYWEIGHT BOUT IN LAS VEGAS MORE

THE ONE THING 
MISSING FROM MY RECORD WAS COME TO 
AMERICA TO FIGHT NOT JUST COME TO 
FIGHT BUT COME TO WIN AGAINST ONE 
OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IT WOULD BE 
EASY TO STAY AT HOME DEFENCES AND 
RETIRE I WANTED TO SET MYSELF A 
GOAL OF COMING TO AMERICA I'VE NOT 
SEEN THE TAPE I DON'T FEEL WAS A 
PRETTY FIGHT L. NEVER THOUGHT WOULD 
BE A PRETTY FIGHT L. L. KNEW THAT 
HOPKINS WAS DIRTY ON THE INSIDE AND 
DEFENSIVE WHICH DOESN'T SUIT ME 
THE SIGN OF A TRUE CHAMPION IS HOW 
HE ADAPTS UNDER ANY SITUATIONS 
THAT WAS JOE CALZAGHE AFTER THAT 
BOUT IN LAS VEGAS YESTERDAY'S 
FOOTBALL FULHAM A STAIR 
RELEGATION IN THE FACE THEY LOST TO 
LIVERPOOL THEY ARE SECOND FROM 
BOTTOM READING BEING SUCKED INTO 
THE MIERP AFTER LOSING AT ARSENAL 
MANCHESTER UNITED STILL THE TEAM TO 
CATCH AT THE TOP THEY TO WORK HARD 
TO GET A RESULT AT BLACKBURN ROVERS 
SIR ALEX FERGUSON'S TEAM ARE STILL 
CLEAR FAVOURITES TO WIN THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE IT IS NOT GOING TO BE A 
PRECESSION THEY CAME CLOSE TO 
LOSING AT EWOOD PARK 
SAPBLT TA CRUISE WITH A GOAL THERE 
WERE SERIES OF OUTSTANDING SAEVS 
UNITED NEVER GIVE IN WITH THE 
CLOCK TICKING DOWN CARLOS TEVEZ GOT 
THE EQUALISER THEIR FATE VERY MUCH 
IN THEIR OWN HANDS 
IT WAS DESIRE IT WAS COMMITMENT 
THE BELIEF THAT WE ARE THE BEST 
TEAM WE ARE THE TEAM THAT WE WANT 
TO BE CHAMPIONS WE PLAY WITH A LOT 
OF DETERMINATION A LOT OF 
CONVICTION IN THE SECOND HALF 
ARSENAL'S TITLE AMBITIONS WENT UP 
IN SMOKE LAST SUNDAY THEIR WIN 
OVER READING HAS REPERCUSSIONS AT 
THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE GOALS 
FROM EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR PUTTING 
STEVE KOPPEL'S SIDE TO THE SWORD 
BOLTON LEAPFROGED THEM AND 
BIRMINGHAM AFTER A ONE TO ZERO WIN OVER 
MIDDLESBOROUGH GAVIN MCCANN GIVING 
THEM HOPE 
WE HAVE GIVEN OURSELVES 
A SKWAECK WE HAVE DIFFICULT GAMES 
COMING UP AS AS EVERYBODY ELSE IT 
IS NICE BEING OUT OF THE BOTTOM 
THREE I WON'T SUGGEST IT IS NOT 
FULHAM APPEAR DOOMED THEY LOST TWO TO ZERO 
AT HOME TO LIVERPOOL 
THREE GAMES TO GO FIVE POINTS TO 
MAKE UP 
IT IS NOT LOOKING GOOD 
SO HERE IS THE TOP OF THE TABLE 
MANCHESTER UNITED THREE POINTS 
AHEAD OF CHELSEA AND ARSENAL AND 
LIVERPOOL THE BOTTOM 
CELTIC KEPT THEIR HOPES ALIVE 
GEORGIOS SAMARAS SCORED THE ONLY 
GOAL OF THE GAME CELTIC LEAD THE 
S. P. L. BY TWO POINTS FROM RANGERS 
THEY ARE PLAYED THREE GAMES MORE 
RANGERS THEMSELVES ARE NOT IN 
LEAGUE ACTION THIS WEEKEND THEY 
PLAY SAINT JOHNSTONE IN THE SEMI FINAL 
OF THE SCOTTISH CUP BACK TO THE 
FIGHT IN LAS VEGAS OUR 
CORRESPONDENT IS STANDING BY GIVE 
US YOUR VIEWS YOU WERE CLOSE TO 
THE ACTION BEARING IN MIND 
CALZAGHE WAS KNOCKED DOWN IN THE 
FIRST ROUND WHAT DID HE DO TO 
RECOVER 
KNOCKED DOWN IN THE FIRST RECOVER ROUND AND WAS LOSING TOUCH WITH HIS 
OWE PONTINGENT I THOUGHT IN THE 
NEXT TWO OR THREE ROUNDS IN ROUND 
SEVEN OR EIGHT HE STARTED PUTTING IN A MORE 
AGGRESSIVE WORK RATE STARTED 
SCORING THE PUNCHES THAT THE JUDGES 
WERE BEGINNING TO TAKE NOTICE OF IT 
BY ROUND TWELVE A LOT OF PEOPLE RING 
SIDE HAD IT VERY CLOSE A LOT 
CLOSER THAN THE AMERICAN NETWORKS 
HERE H. B. O. SAID CALZAGHE WON IT BY 
FIVE ROUNDS THAT CAUSED SURPRISE 
RING SIDE L. WAS STANDING YARDS 
AWAY FROM HOPKINS WHEN THAT 
DECISION WAS ANNOUNCE SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE HE HAD 
HIS HANDS IN THE AIR HE THOUGHT HE 
HAD WON HE WAS SHOCKED BY THE 
DECISION ON BALANCE CALZAGHE 
DESERVED TO WIN IT WAS A GREAT 
COMEBACK HE STEPPED IT WASN'T HIS 
BEST FIGHT IT WAS ONE OF HIS 
BRAVEST I THINK HE DESERVED IT 
TONIGHT 
IT IS HIS FIRST R. FIRST TONIGHT VISIT TO AMERICA FIRST TIME 
FIGHTING IN VEGAS AGAINST A LEGEND 
BEARING IN MIND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS 
FOR BRITISH FIGHT TORS GET A RESULT 
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS 
I THINK 
IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT JUST WALKING 
OUT OF THE ARENA TONIGHT I WAS 
LISTENING TO AN AMERICAN RADIO 
STATION THEY WERE TALKING IN 
GLOWING TERMS ABOUT CALZAGHE THE 
WAY HE HAD DISMANT AMED 
DISMANTLED AND AMERICAN LEN END 
THAT WAS THEIR WORDS THERE ARE 
PEOPLE IMPRESSED BY JOE CALZAGHE IT 
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN HE WILL 
COME BACK HERE WHAT IT MEANS HE 
WILL ATTRACT THE BIG AMERICAN 
FIGHTERS TO FIGHT HIM BACK IN 
CARDIFF ROY JONES JUNIOR CALLED 
HIM OUT SAID TO CALZAGHE I WILL 
COME TO CARDIFF THAT IS PERHAPS AN 
OPTION FOR JOE CALZAGHE HE HAS A 
YEAR LEFT IN HIS CAREER HE DOESN'T 
WANT TOO MANY FOR FIGHTS HE HAS 
DONE ENOUGH IN THE STATES TO 
SUGGEST HE WANTS TO REPAY THE 
LOYALTY OF THE FAN THAT IS CAME 
WITH HIM BY HAVING ANOTHER FIGHT AT 
THE MILLENNIUM STADIUM STKPWHRSM 
LONDON IRISH KEPT THEIR PREMIERSHIP 
PLAY OFF HOPES ALIVE HE 
THEDGEEDGEED PAST HARLEQUINS IN A

THE IRISH TOPSY OJO WAS THE SCORER 
THEY WON BY THIRTEEN TO SIX THEY FACE 
TOULOUSE IN THE HEINEKEN CUP 
CARDIFF BLUES WIN OVER ULSTER MOST 
OF THE DAMAGE DONE IN THE FIRST 
HALF AS THE BLUES OPENED UP A TWENTY SEVEN TO THREE 
LEAD CARP DIFFICULT WERE SECOND 
THIRD PLACE MUNSTER 
THEY HAD A TIGHT MATCH AGAINST THE 
OSPREYS 
RUGBY LEAGUE CHALLENGE CUP OSPREYS HARLEQUINS BEAT CASTLEFORD FORTY FOUR TO THIRTEEN 
NOTHING WENT RIGHT FOR THE QUINS IN 
THE FIRST HALF THEY BARELY HAD A 
LOOK IN WITH THE BOTTOM TEAM HAVING 
RUN IN TWO TRIES IN THE FIRST HALF 
MICHAEL SHELTON AND ADAM FLETCHER 
GIVING THEM FOURTEEN TO ZERO AT HALF TIME THE 
SECOND HALF WAS A TURN AROUND THEY 
RATTLED OFF TWO TRIES FORTY FOUR TO FOURTEEN WAS 
THE FINAL SCORE IN THAT MATCH 
TO SNOOKER JOHN HIGGINS HAS 
DEFEATED MATTHEW STEVENS TO GO TO 
THE SECOND ROUND OF THE WORLD 
SNOOKER CHAMPIONSHIPS IN SHEFFIELD 
STEVENS MADE THE BETTER START 
BEFORE HIGGINS LEAD SEVEN TO TWO INTO THE 
EVENING SESSION THE CHAMPION HAD 
TO DEAL WITH A STEVENS FIGHT BACK 
BUT REGAINED CONTROL IN THE FINAL 
TWOL FRAMES OF THE MATCH AS HE WON 
TEN TO FIVE HA IS THE SPORT FOR NOW 
THAT IS THE SPORT FOR NOW A 
LOVELY PICTURE ON YOUR WALL MAYBE 
YOU WILL THINK ABOUT SELLING IT 
BEFORE YOU DO YOU THINK WHY NOT LET 
SOMEONE ELSE HAVE A LOOK AT IT THE 
ARTIST YOU CLAIM IS VINCENT VAN 
GOGH SOME OF THE RICHEST ART 
COLLECTORS ARE STRIEG TO ESTABLISH 
WHETHER THE WORK IS IN FACT REAL 
IF IT IS GENUINE IT COULD BECOME 
THE WORLD'S MOST EXPENSIVE PAINTING 
THE PICTURE'S OWNER DORETTA PEPPA 
WANTS THE WORLD TO SEE THIS VERSION 
OF DOCTOR GACHET BEFORE IT IS SOLD AND 
VANISHES INTO A PRIVATE COLLECTION 
MAJOR AUCTION HOUSE AND A 
MILLIONAIRE IS AMONG THE BIDDERS 
FOR FOURTEEN YEARS THIS WAS THE WORLD'S 
MOST EXPENSIVE WORK OF ART PT SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS 
MILLION MILLION THE WHERE ABOUTS OF THAT VAN GOUGH 
ARE UNKNOWN WHICH INCREASES THE 
INTEREST IN MRS. PEPPA'S DOCTOR GACHET 
GREEK ART EXPERT HAS BEEN WORKING 
TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PORTRAIT 
IS A FAKE 
MY ASSESSMENT IS THAT 
THIS PAINTING IS A YOU AUTO NEECK 
AUTHENTIC PAINTING 
IT IS A PAINTING HE MADE IN THE 
LAST YEAR OF HIS LIFE 
OF COURSE IT'S A UNIQUE TREASURE 
VAN GOUGH MUSEUM IN AMSTERDAM 
REGARDING AS THE WORLD'S MOST 
FOREMOST AUTHORITY ON THE ARTIST 
WORK HAS REFUSED TO DISCUSS THE 
PAINTING I HAVE SHOWN THIS 
PHOTOGRAPH TO THREE VAUGHAN GOUGH 
EXPERTS THEY WILL NOT SAY IT IS A 
VAN GOUGH WITHOUT SEEING IT IN THE 
FLESH THE KEY CLUES ARE NAZI 
STAMP AND CODE ON THE BACK 
I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO FILM THEM 
THE STAMP BELONGED TO A GROUP LEAD 
BY ALFRED ROSENBORG A NAZI IN 
CHARGE OF ARTS STOLE FRN THE JEWS 
AND WAS TRIED IN NUREMBERG AFTER 
THE WAR AND HANGED MRS. PEPPIATT 
FOUND VAUGHAN GOUGH'S NOTEBOOK IN 
HER LATE FATHER'S POSSESSIONS HE 
ATANGED A NAZI TRAIN IT IT TOOK 
LOOTED TREASURY BACK TO GERMANY 
THE BLOOD TA PAIN OF PEOPLE IT IS 
SOMETHING THAT ALWAYS MAKES ME FEEL 
VERY BADLY BUT SINCE IT'S NOBODY'S 
LIVE GOES ON 
SHE SAYS NO ONE HAS 
COME FORWARD TO CLAIM THE PICTURE 
UNDER GREEK LAW IT NOW BELONGS TO 
HER SHE COULD BECOME VERY WEALTHY 
UNLESS OF COURSE THIS PAINTING 
TURNS OUT TO BE ONE OF MANY FAKE 
VAN GOINGS IT APPEARS SHE HAD IT 
ON HER KITCHEN TABLE THAT IS WHAT 
TICKLEED ME THE FOREIGN SECRETARY 
IS WARNING LABOUR M. P.'S ANGRY AT THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. TAX RATE THAT 
SQUABBLING RISKS ELECTORAL JOHN 
PRESCOTT HAS ADMITTED TO SUFFERING 
FROM BULIMIA 
ALSO 
SOMEBODY IN THEIR IVORY ALSO TOWER RIPPING OFF THE EVERY DAY 
PERSON WHO HAS TO WORK FOR A 
LIVING 
WE WILL TELL YOU WHAT LIVING DRIVES THIS MOTORIST MAD 
GOOD MORNING I THINK COMPARED WITH 
YESTERDAY TODAY'S WEATHER IS LIKELY 
TO BE BRIGHTER FOR MANY OF US IT 
WILL FEEL A TOUCH WARMER GENERALLY 
ACROSS THE UNITED KINGDOM THE WINDS 
WILL ALSO BE JUST A TOUCH LIGHTER 
ON THE SATELLITE PICTURE WE HAVE A 
STRIPE OF CLOUD COMING IN ACROSS 
THE CENTRAL AREAS OF THE UNITED 
KINGDOM CLEARER SKIES OVER 
SCOTLAND AND INTO THE SOUTH OF 
ENGLAND YOU CAN SEE THIS CURL OF 
WHITE CLOUD THAT WILL SPREAD INTO 
SOUTHERN ENGLAND AS WE HEAD INTO 
SUNDAY AFTERNOON LET'S MAKE THE 
MOST OF THE BRIGHT START MOST OF 
US WILL SEE SOME MORNING SUNSHINE 
IT WILL START OFF MISTY IT WILL 
TAKE A WHILE BEFORE THAT MIST BURNS 
OFF MOST OF US NOT DOING TOO BADLY 
FOR WALES EXTENSIVE CLOUD WILL 
BRING IN DRIZZLE 
SNOWDONIA HAVING A DRIZZLY START 
THAT RAIN NOT TOO FAR FROM NORTHERN 
IRELAND HERE IT WILL START OFF 
MORE CLOUDY THAN IT DID THIS TIME 
YESTERDAY IN THE NORTHERN ISLES IT 
SHOULD BRIGHTEN UP FROST FOR 
WESTERN SCOTLAND HERE IT WILL BE 
BRIGHT AND SUNNY FIRST THING CLOUD 
FOR THE MIDLANDS WILL BRING A FEW 
SPITS AND SPOTS OF RAIN AS WE HEAD 
THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING INTO THE 
AFTERNOON WE GO WE WILL CONTINUE 
TO FEED IN CLOUD ACROSS THE CENTRAL 
UNITED KINGDOM BRINGING A FEW MR. 
SPITS AND SPOTS OF RAIN IN THE END 
BRIGHTER WEATHER TO THE SOUTH 
SUNSHINE AND FEELING WARM THERE 
WILL BE HEAVY SHOWERS DEVELOPING 
THE WEATHER LOOKING FINE FOR 
SCOTLAND GREAT NEWS FOR THE SEMI 
FINAL OF THE SCOTTISH CUP MATCH 
MORE CLOUD YOU WILL NOTICE FOR THE 
KICKOFF AT ASTON VILLA AGAINST 
BIRMINGHAM THE LOCAL DERBY HERE 
STAYING CLOUDY AND GREY DURING THE 
COURSE OF THE MATCH THIS EVENING 
AND OVERNIGHT THERE WILL BE AN 
EXTENSIVE CLOUD OVER THE UNITED 
KINGDOM SOME OUTBREAKS OF RAIN 
PUSHING OVER TOWARDS DEVON AND 
CORNWALL BECAUSE OF THE CLOUD IT 
WILL STAY ON THE MILD SIDE 
TEMPERATURES SEVEN TO EIGHT CELSIUS 
MONDAY I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE 
TOO BAD FOR MOST OF US THE START 
OF THE NEW WORKING WEEK A PROMISING 
LOOKING DAY THE RAIN WILL TEND TO 
CLEAR FROM THE SOUTH WEST THE 
SKIES WILL BRIGHTEN UP AS WELL THE 
HIGHS UP TO AROUND FIFTEEN CELSIUS OR SIXTEEN 
CELSIUS SUNSHINE AROUND ON TUESDAY 
WEDNESDAY LOOKING MORE UNSETTLED 
WITH SHOWERS AND LONGER SPELLS OF 
RAIN RAIN NOW HIGHER TAXES SPEED CAMERAS AT 
EVERY TURN IT SEEMS NOW THERE IS 
NEW WHICH COULD LEAVE 
SOMETHING NEW WHICH COULD LEAVE MOTORISTS MAD IF YOU LEAVE YOUR 
ENGINE RUNNING UNNECESSARILY YOU 
COULD SOON FACE A FORTY FINE IN 
OXFORD 
OXFORD IT IS PART OF A SCHEME TO 
CUT AIR POLLUTION IS THIS A 
SENSIBLE MOVE 
IT IS A JOKE IT IS 
OBVIOUSLY TO DO WITH POLLUTION BUT 
TO TURN YOUR CAR OFF AND START IT 
AGAIN YOU CAUSE MORE POLLUTION BY 
STARTING IT AGAIN IT IS ANOTHER 
TAX AND FINE WHICH IS FOR MO REASON 
IT WILL HURT PEOPLE'S PURSE BUT 
AFTER A WHILE PEOPLE WILL POLICE 
THEMSELVES 
NO ONE LEAVES THEIR CAR THEMSELVES RUNNING FOR THE SAKE OF IT 
EVERYONE HAS TO PAY FOR THEIR FUEL 
EVEN THE PEOPLE ON BUSINESS 
VEHICLES DON'T LEAVE VEHICLES 
RUNNING FOR THE SAKE OF IT YOU 
HAVE TO TURN IT ON AND OFF EVERY 
TWO MINUTES YOU USE UP MORE FUEL 
THAN IF IT WAS RUNNING FOR A MINUTE 
WHO WILL POLICE IT 
IT IS NOT FAIR 
TOO MANY PEOPLE NEED TO LEAVE THEIR 
ENGINES RUNNING FOR DIFFERENT 
REASONS IT SEEMS RIDICULOUS LET'S LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS TO ADAM RAYNER AND 
AUTHOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGNER 
DONACHADH MCARTHY HOW MUCH DAMAGE 
DOES IT CAUSE 
SO LONG AS YOUR CAR 
IS SITING THERE IT EMITS POISONS 
CARS EMIT EVERY DAY MOST OF OUR 
CITY CENTRES ARE TWICE THE LEVEL 
THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS SAID IS 
SAFE WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH 
POLLUTION IN CITY CENTRES IT IS A 
GOOD AWARENESS RAISING INITIATIVE 
I DON'T THINK WE WILL SEE A LOT OF 
DRIVERS FINED FORTY WE SHOULD NOT 
SIT OUTSIDE OUR SCHOOLS WITH 
POLLUTION POURING OUT OF OUR CARS 
IT IS NOT BAD TO LAY DOWN A MARKER 
MAKE PEOPLE THINK 
AS HE WILL TELL 
YOU THERE ARE CARS WHICH ARE 
DESIGNED TO STOP WHEN YOU STOP AT 
THE LIGHT S. AND OFF IT GOES AGAIN 
WHILE HE RECKONS IT IS A MARKER I 
THINK I IT IS A BIT ABOUT THE CITY 
FATHERS TRYING TO RAISE MONEY 
THERE IS AN OFFENCE UNDER THE LAW 
CALLED QUITTING IT IS ABOUT YOUR 
CAR NOT UNDER FULL CONTROL WHEN YOU 
ARE IN IT THE CARS WHICH ALLOW YOU 
TO 
THIS IS NOT ABOUT QUITTING THIS IS 
ANOTHER KEY WORD THIS IS QUIDS 
IT IS AN ATTEMPT TO GET THE TRAFFIC 
WARDENS TO GATHER UP MORE MONEY 
THE GOOD PEOPLE OF OXFORD ARE 
HORRIFIED 
IT IS A PROBLEM WITH HORRIFIED SOMETHING WHICH APPEARS TO BE AN 
ENVIRONMENT ISSUE BUT OTHER PEOPLE 
PARTICULARLY MOTORISTS SEE IT AS AN 
EXTRA TAX AND REVENUE RAISER IT IT WILL COST OXFORD CITY MORE TO 
ENFORCE THIS THAN NOT TO ENFORCE IT 
IT IS NOT ABOUT RAISING MONEY IT 
IS ABOUT RAISING AWARENESS IN MY 
VIEW THIS WHOLE STORY CAME FROM 
HOW DO WE STOP CARS POLLUTING THE 
MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TIMES 
CHANGE IF THE GOVERNMENT ENFORCED 
SPEED LIMITS ON THE MOTORWAYS WE 
COULD GET CUT THREE MILLION TONNES 
OF C. O. TWO A YEAR THE WIDER PICTURE IS 
BEING MISSED HERE 
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO PRACTICAL 
ELEMENTS IF YOU WERE TRYING TO 
ADHERE TO THIS COULD YOU SEE WHERE 
THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT ARISE 
SCHOOL PICK UP IT IS A COLD 
WINTER'S DAY AND A MUM OR DAD IS 
OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL THEY WILL KEEP 
THEIR ENGINE RUNNING WON'T THEY 
ALONG WITH TAXI DRIVERS THE 
QUITTING OFFENCE HAS GOT A SPECIAL 
ALLOWANCE FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLES 
AND SO FORTH BUT IN ACTUAL FACT 
UNLESS IT IS A FREEZING FREEZING 
COLD DAY THEN YES DO LET'S TURN 
THE ENGINES OFF OUTSIDE SCHOOL 
THOSE YOUNG LUNGS ARE MORE 
VULNERABLE TO TOXINS THAT THAT 
COULD BE PART OF AN EDUCATIONAL 
THING FOR SCRUMYS HAVE A LOW 
OPINION OF MY FELLOW SCHOOL RUNNERS 
YOU ARE SYMPATHETIC TO THIS PEOPLE 
THINK NOT TO HAVE THE CAR RUNNING 
WHEN YOU DON'T NEED TO 
I DID 
ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES FOR MY 
DEGREE COURSE THIS IS THE ONLY ONE 
WE HAVE GOT IT IS LIKE GROWN UP 
TEETH IT IS ONLY ONE SET YOU GET 
SO LET'S NOT SCREW IT UP TELL TELL PEOPLE TO STOP RUNNING THEIR 
ENGINES DON'T FINE THEM 
IF YOU 
DON'T HAVE A FINE PEOPLE WILL 
IGNORE IT HAVING THE FEAR OF A 
THREAT HELPS PEOPLE FOCUS THEIR 
MINDS 
NOW T'AI CHI FOR COWS A CAR MINDS ORCHESTRA IT CAN ONLY BE THE 
WEIRD AND WONDERFUL WORLD OF ODDBOX

AT THE CASINO FOR THE POST FIGHT 
PARTY HE HAS BEEN CHEERED TO THE 
RAFTERS BY FANS BOTH WELSH AND 
AMERICAN HE HAS DONE WHAT HE SET 
TOUT ACHIEVE HE HAS COME TO 
AMERICA AND HE HAS BEATEN A LEGEND 
IN BERNARD HOPKINS AS YOU 
MENTIONED THERE HE DID IT THE HARD 
WAY IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY WITHIN 
LESS THAN A MINUTE OF THE FIRST 
ROUND HE HAD BEEN KNOCKED DOWN FOR 
ONLY THE THIRD TIME IN HIS CAREER 
HE GOT UP BACK INTO THE FIGHT IN 
THE END HILLS YOUNGER LEGS AT THIRTY SIX 
WERE TOO MUCH FOR BERNARD HOPKINS 
AT FORTY THREE 
MANY MORE PUNCHES AFTERWARDS HE 
WAS CLEARLY RELIEVED TO HAVE GOT 
THE WIN 
THE ONE THING MISSING FROM 
MY RECORD WAS COME TO AMERICA AND 
FIGHT NOT JUST COME TO FIGHT BUT 
COME TO WIN AGAINST ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST NAMES THAT IS WHAT 
CHAMPIONS ARE ABOUT IT WOULD BE 
EASY TO STAY AT HOME A FEW MORE 
DEFENCES AND RETIRE L. WANTED TO 
SET MYSELF A GOAL COMING TO AMERICA 
I HAVE NOT SEEN THE TAPE I DON'T 
FEEL IT WAS A PRETTY FIGHT L. NEVER 
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A PRETTY FIGHT 
I KNEW THAT HOPKINS WAS QUITE DIRTY 
ON THE INSIDE AND DEFENSIVE WHICH 
DOESN'T SUIT ME THE SIGN OF A TRUE 
CHAMPION IS HOW HE ADAPTS UNDER ANY 
SITUATIONS SITUATIONS CALZAGHE WAS FULL OF PRAISE FOR THE 
THOUSANDS WHO CAME HERE FROM WALES 
AN ACROSS BRITAIN TO CHEER HIM ON 
PARTICULARLY IN THE ANTHEMS WHEN 
THEY HEARD FROM SIR TOM JONES AND 
ALSO DIDN'T BOO THE AMERICAN ANTHEM 
WHICH YOU MAY REMEMBER WAS A 
PROBLEM WITH RICKY HATTON HOW WILL 
HE REWARD THAT LOYALTY HIS 
SUGGESTION IS THAT HIS NEXT FIGHT 
MIGHT COME IN CARDIFF AT THE 
MILLENNIUM STADIUM THAT MIGHT 
PROVIDE HIM FOR A FINAL FLURRY TO 
GREAT CAREER WE HEARD THAT 
SYLVESTER STA LONE DESCRIBED HIM AS 
THE GREATEST BOXER IN THE WORLD AT

WHO WORKED CLOSEST WITH HIM IN HIS 
OFFICE THEY REALISED SOMETHING WAS 
WRONG WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER KNEW 
OR DID NOT KNOW WE HAVEN'T BEEN 
TOLD HE SAYS NOW WHAT HE WANTS TO 
DO IS GET INVOLVED WITH PROMOTING 
SOME SORT OF TREATMENT AND 
SOLUTIONS FOR THIS TO PLAY A PUBLIC 
ROLE IN DEALING WITH THIS 
PARTICULAR CONDITION WHICH HE SAYS 
IS NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH YOUNG 
WOMEN HE TALKS ABOUT GOING FOR

IT WILL GET WARMER TROUT THE WEEK 
THAT IS THE WAY THE WEATHER IS 
LOOKING LOOKING NOW IT MIGHT BE A BIT EARLY FOR YOU 
MAYBE NOT DO YOU FANCY A CHICKEN 
TIKKA TO GO WITH A DISH OF RICE 
YOU COULD SOON BE ABLE TO POP INTO 
A CHAIB OF INDIAN RESTAURANTS WHICH 
IS INTO A CHAIN OF INDIAN 
RESTAURANTS WHICH IS OPENING UP 
WHETHER IT IS A COFFEE FROM CAFFE 
NERO OR A BURGER FROM BURGER KING 
WHEN IT COMES TO THE HIGH STREET 
IT IS CRAMMED WITH FRANCHISES NO 
ONE HAS OPENED A CHAIN OF INYAND 
IND YAND STRANTS UNTIL NOW TIFFIN 
BITES HOPES TO CREATE FRANCHISES IN 
BRITAIN FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PLUS A SHARE 
OF PROFITS FRANCHISEES GET FOOD 
FROM A KITCHEN WHICH IS THEN HEATED 
LOCALLY 
WE ARE HEADING FOR YOUNG LOCALLY ENTREPRENEURS WHO WANT TO SEE AN 
OPTION FOR THEM TO GET INTO THE 
INDIAN FOOD INDUSTRY RATHER THAN 
THEM TAKING ON A FAMILY RUN 
SCENARIO THEY COULD HAVE A 
FRANCHISE WHICH COULD COULD BUILD 
UP INTO TWO OR THREE DEPENDING ON 
HOW KEEN AND HUNGRY THEY ARE WILL WILL LOSING THAT FAMILY RUN FEEL BE A 
RECIPE FOR PROBLEMS 
ONE OF THE 
DOWN SIDES IS MOST TEND TO BE 
RECIPE FOR PROBLEMS ONE OF THE 
DOWN SIDES IS MOST TEND TO BE FAMILY RUN BUSINESSES OFFERING 
HOME RECIPES FROM THEIR MENUS ONE 
THING YOU LOSE IS IT BECOMES MORE 
IMPERSONAL BY THE NATURE IT IS 
SCALED UP TO DIFFERENT OUTLETS YOU 
LOSE A LOT OF THAT ORIGINALITY AND 
THAT SIDE OF THINGS STKPWRFPLT THE 
CONCEPT OF FRANCHISING INDIAN 
RESTAURANT 
THE CONCEPT OF 
FRANCHISING INDIAN RESTAURANTS HAS 
COME A LONG WAY THE GOVERNMENT IS 
CLAMPING DOWN ON IMMIGRATION THAT 
COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR 
RESTAURANTS TO GET THE CHEFS THEY 
NEED JENNIFER JOYCE IS AN ETHNIC 
COOKERY TEACHER AND FOOD WRITER IT 
HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING A 
NATIONWIDE CHAIN OF INDIAN 
RESTAURANTS IS IT WELCOME I I THINK IT IS THE WHOLE SCENE OF 
CHAINS HERE HAS CHANGED WE HAVE 
SEEN PLACES LIKE THESE DIFFERENT 
ASIAN CHAIN RESTAURANTS WHICH ARE 
PUTTING OUT GOOD QUALITY FOOD VERY 
CONSISTENTLY 
PEOPLE WILL THINK IT CONSISTENTLY IS COOKED CENTRALLY HEATED UP 
LOCALLY PEOPLE LIKE THE IDEA OF 
SOMEONE BEING IN THE KITCHEN AND 
YOU ORDER THE FOOD AND THEY COOK IT 
FOR YOU 
YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED TO 
KNOW HOW MANY CHAINS DO WHAT YOU 
JUST SAID A LOT DO THE CONSISTENCY 
THEY MAKE IT AT A CENTRAL LOCATION 
THEY DEPLOY IT OUT TO THEIR 
RESTAURANTS 
ONE THING PEOPLE LIKE RESTAURANTS ABOUT INDIAN RESTAURANTS IS IT IS A 
FAMILY THING THERE IS SOMEONE 
COOKING SOMEONE TAKING THE ORDERS 
THIS SEEMS TO GO AGAINST THE GRAIN 
THIS IS NEW BREED OF RESTAURANT 
THEY ARE PROBABLY NOT TRYING TO 
SELL IT AS A SIT DOWN LOVELY SMELL 
OF THE CURRY TYPE RESTAURANT THIS 
IS A FAST GOOD HEALTHY FOOD IT IS 
MORE ON THE RUN THAN A LEISURELY 
EVENING 
PEOPLE ASSUME IF SOMETHING EVENING IS TURNED INTO A FAST FOOD THING 
THEN THE QUALITY WILL GO DOWN BUT 
HAS THERE BEEN A RISE IN GOOD 
QUALITY FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS 
RECENTLY 
I THINK MASSIVELY ONE RECENTLY GREAT EXAMPLE IS THE CHAIN LEON 
WHICH HAS STARTED TO APPEAR ALL 
OVER LONDON THEY DO ETHNIC DISHES 
LIKE MEAT BALLS WITH BROWN RICE IT 
IS BILLED AS VERY HEALTHY FOOD IT 
IS EXTREMELY TASTEY L. HAVE SEEN IT 
TO BE VERY CONSISTENT 
ARE SOME 
DISHES BETTER FOR THE FAST FOOD 
MARKET IS IT ONE OF THE REASON WHY 
BURGERS AND FRIS IT IS NOT SLOP 
PI IT IS EASIER TO DO THAT KIND OF 
THING THAN IT IS TO DO INDIAN FOOD 
CURRY SAUCES THAT KIND OF STUFF 
WITH FOOD YOU CAN STAGE ANYTHING 
REALLY IF YOU LIKE IT IS ALL ABOUT 
BUYING GREAT INGREDIENTS HAVING 
GREAT CHEFS AND YOUR STRATEGY OF 
HOW YOU MAKE IT AND DEPLOY IT OUT 
TO THE SITES YOU CAN DO IT WITH 
ANY FOOD 
IF YOU HAD THE CHOICE 
THOUGH WOULD YOU GO INTO A CHAIN 
RESTAURANT OR WOULD YOU GO INTO 
SOMEWHERE WHICH YOU SAW WAS 
INDEPENDENT FAMILY RUN AND YOU 
KNEW THEY COOKED FRESH IN THE 
KITCHEN 
YEARS AGO THE THOUGHT OF A KITCHEN CHAIN WAS GRIM TO ME L. HAVE LIVED 
HERE SIXTEEN YEARS NOW I HAVE CHANGED 
MY TUNE ONE OF OUR FAVOURITE 
PLACES IS CALLED PING PONG THE 
FOOD IS OF A GREAT QUALITY 
SOMETIMES I DON'T SAY IT HAS TO BE 
A LOVELY CHARMING RESTAURANT IF 
THE FOOD IS GREAT THAT IS WHAT 
COUNTS THAT IS FIRST AND FOREMOST 
THANK YOU GET IN CONTACT WITH US 
ABOUT THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS 
AFTER EIGHT HUNDRED A M. WE WILL SPEAK TO A 
TELEVISION CHEF NOW ANDREW PIERCE 
HAS JOINED US FROM THE TELEGRAPH 
WE ARE GOING TO START WITH THE SUN 
TIMES TIMES IT IS LOVELY TO BE BACK ON G. M. T. V. 
A QUICK FLICK THROUGH THE PAPERS 
WHILE ANDREW IS BITTER WE WILL 
HAVE A CHAT ABOUT JOHN PRESCOTT IN 
A MOMENT L. KNOW YOU ARE INTERESTED 
IN THIS FROM THE SUN TIMES IN HIS 
MEMOIRS HE SAYS HE IS SUFFER FROM 
BULIMIA HE IS NO LONGER SUFFERING 
BUT SEVENTEEN YEARS HE SUFFERED THE NEWS 
OF THE WORLD HAS THIS STORY THAT 
PRINCE WILLIAM LANDED HIS R. A. F. 
HELICOPTER IN HIS GIRLFRIEND'S BACK 
GARDEN SPARKED OUTRAGE 
THE SUN TELEGRAPH SHALL WE LOOK 
AT THIS MAX MOSLEY HAS SAID HE HAS 
A RIGHT TO PURSUE HIS ECCENTRIC 
PRIVATE LIFE AND THE PEOPLE SAYING 
THAT THE MCCANNS ARE FACING A NEW 
CHARGE POSSIBLY A CHARGE OF CHILD 
ENDANGERMENT THE MAIL ON SUNDAY 
SAYS THE GOVERNMENT IS LAUNCHING A 
SURVEY LOOKING AT THE INTIMATE 
DETAILS OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE ASKING 
ABOUT THEIR SEX LIFES AND EARNINGS 
LET'S LOOK AT THE SUN TIMES GOES 
THROUGH SOME OF THE STUFF IN THIS 
STORY 
IT IS ASTONISHING THIS WAS STORY ONE OF THE BEST KEPT SECRETS AT 
WESTMINSTER WE THINK WE KNOW 
EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON NUDGES 
AND WINKS NO CLUE ABOUT THIS IT 
IS LIKE JOHN MAJOR AND EDWINA 
CURRIE YOU WOULD NOT THINK A FIFTEEN 
STONE BRUISER HAS AN EATING 
DISORDER THAT YOU ASSOCIATE WITH 
YOUNG GIRLS PRINCESS DIANA HAD THE 
SAME DISORDER HE TALKS ABOUT 
DOWNING A TIN OF CARNATION MILK 
JUST FOR THE TASTE AND HOW HIS 
BREAK FROM WORK WAS TO EAT DID IT 
IMPACT ON HIS ABILITY TO DO HIS 
JOB THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THIS 
DISORDER ARE DEPRESSION AND STRESS 
AND I DON'T THINK HE WAS A VERY 
GOOD MINISTER AT ALL L. HAVE NEVER 
THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THE REASON 
COULD BE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE 
FACT HE HAD THIS TERRIBLE CONDITION 
HE SAID IT WAS THE STRESS OF THE 
JOB WHICH DROVE HIM TO THIS 
BEHAVIOUR 
IT IS IT IS ONLY IN THE 
LAST YEAR SINCE HE LEFT OFFICE THAT 
THE CONDITION HAS IMPROVED HIS 
WIFE SHOPPED HIM IT IS THIS IDEA 
OF HIM BEING IN A WAITING ROOM IN A 
HOSPITAL WITH YOUNG GIRLS AND NO 
ONE TOLD US NO ONE TOLD THE MEDIA 
NO ONE FOUND OUT SHOULD HE HAVE 
CONFESSED BEFORE 
DO YOU THINK THE 
REASON HE DIDN'T MAKE IT PUBLIC 
BEFORE IS THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE 
SOLUTIONS ONE IS AS A MAN AS A 
PERSON IT IS VERY EMBARRASSING 
PARTICULARLY MAN LIKE JOHN PRESCOTT 
THE OTHER IS DID HE PRESCOTT THINK IN TERMS OF HIS POLITICAL 
CAREER THAT IT COULD HAVE MEANT 
THEY SAID HANG ON YOU HAVE A 
PROBLEM WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE IS A 
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM CAN HAVE 
CONSEQUENCES THEREFORE YOU SHOULD 
NOT BE IN THAT JOB 
THE LITTLE BIT 
I KNOW ABOUT PRESCOTT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN WHAT WORRIED HIM MOST WOULD BE 
HIS PRIDE THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE 
WOULD HAVE MOCKED HIM AND LAUGHED 
AT THE IDEA THAT HE HAS HE SAYS 
IN HIS MEMOIRS HOW CAN A MAN 
LIKE ME HAVE A GIRL'S DISORDER IT IT IS INTERESTING TO LOOK AT THIS 
STORY IN THE INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY 
ABOUT ALISTAIR CAMPBELL ABOUT 
CALLING FOR AN END TO STIGMA OF 
DEPRESSION IN THE WORKPLACE 
HE HAS 
GIVEN AN INTERVIEW TO THE 
INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY TALKING ABOUT 
HIS WELL PUBLICISED BREAK UP IT IS 
WHEN HE WAS A POLITICAL EDITOR 
EITHER WITH THE TODAY NEWSPAPER OR 
THE DAILY MIRROR HE WAS DRINKING 
TOO MUCH IT WAS NEIL KINNOCK WHO 
PICKED HIM UP AND SAID IF YOU DON'T 
PICK YOURSELF UP YOU WILL BE IN 
TROUBLE TROUBLE HE IS CALLING NOW FOR AN END TO 
STIGMA AND DEPRESSION IN THE 
WORKPLACE L. WONDER IF HE HAD KNOWN 
THAT ABOUT JOHN PRESCOTT IF HE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE PRO ACTIVE 
WITH HIS CONDITION 
DID ALLYSTER 
REINA DEL CAMINO COME CLEAN ABOUT 
THE PROBLEMS HE HAD AFTER HE HAD 
DONE HIS TIME IN NUMBER TEN 
HE WAS 
UP FRONT ABOUT IT BEFORE HE TOOK 
THE JOB AT NUMBER TEN HE TOLD TONY 
BLAIR THAT HE HAD THIS BREAKDOWN 
AND IT WAS PRETTY WELL KNOWN AROUND 
THE PLACE 
MEANWHILE GORDON BROWN THE ROW 
AND REBELLION OVER THE ABOUT RIGS 
OF THE TEN P. TAX AND THE ABOLITION 
OF THE TEN P. TAX RATE 
I LOOKED TO 
SEE IF I COULD FIND SOME HAPPINESS 
IT WAS ALL HORRIBLERY HIJACKED 
ABOUT THE ARGUMENT OF THE TEN P. HOUSE 
RATE IT SAYS THAT IT IS NOT THE 
MEDIA WHICH HAS DRIVEN THIS UP IT 
SAYS IT IS NOT THE PRESS WHICH HAS 
INCITED IT HE HAS TO SCRAP THIS 
IS AN ABHORRATION AND IT IS A 
REGRESSIVE TAX WHICH IS HURTING 
FIVE MILLION OF THE POOREST PEOPLE 
HE HAS TO START LISTENING IT IS 
ACROSS FLEET STREET T. REBELLION 
COULD BE OVER ONE HUNDRED M. P.'S L. DON'T 
THINK IT WILL BE THIS MANY IT IS 
CLEARLY THE BIGGEST POLITICAL 
PROBLEM HE HAS HAD SINCE HE HAS 
BECOME PRIME MINISTER 
AND THE SUN 
EXPRESS STORY 
THIS IS AN ATTEMPT 
TO REBRAND GORDON BROWN AND TO SORT 
OUT HIS P. R. WHICH HAS BEEN EXCABL 
THEY PICKED OUT SOME PICTURES 
THERE HE IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITH 
GEORGE BUSH HE IS NOT ON THE RED 
CARPET AT THE UNITED NATIONS IS 
HE FAST ASLEEP HE IS DUE TO MAKE A 
SPEECH HE IS SECLUDED BY THE 
AUTOCUE 
IT IS COVERING HIS HEAD AUTOCUE IT SEEMS HE SEEMS TO HAVE THE TOUCH 
OF JOHN MAJOR ABOUT HIM AT THE 
MOMENT EVERYTHING HE SEEMS TO DO 
GOES HORRIBLELY WRONG IT WILL GO 
HORRIBLELY WRONG TOMORROW WHEN THEY 
DEBATE THE TEN P. TAX RATE 
I AM SURE 
THAT ANDREW MARR WILL DISCUSS THE 
TEN P. TAX RATE WITH NONE OTHER THAN 
THE CHANCELLOR
