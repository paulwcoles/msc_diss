SYSTEMATIC ATTEMPT UNDER WAY TO

FAILURE TO USE C. C. T. V. PROPERLY IS A 
FIASCO FIASCO ON B. B. C. LONDON NEWS A NEW ERA AT

GOOD EVENING WELCOME TO THE B. B. C. 
NEWS AT SIX DAY BY DAY WE'RE 
GETTING THE TRUE PICTURE OF THE 
DEVASTATION LEFT BEHIND BY CYCLONE 
NARGIS IN BURMA ACCORDING TO THE 
LATEST FIGURES MORE THAN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND 
PEOPLE WERE KILLED BUT ANOTHER 
FORTY THOUSAND ARE STILL MISSING EXPERTS 
SAY IT WILL TAKE AN AID OPERATION 
SIMILAR TO THE ONE MOUNTED AFTER 
THE BOXING DAY TSUNAMI TO HELP ALL 
THOSE AFFECTED MORE ON THAT IN A 
MOMENT BUT FIRST ANDREW HARDING 
REPORTS ON THE WORST CYCLONE TO HIT 
ASIA FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS 
THE SEARCH FOR CLEAN WATER 
BURMA'S SURVIVORS ARE STRUGGLING 
PERHAPS ONE MILLION PEOPLE HAVE LOST 
THEIR LIVES HERE LOST THEIR 
HOMES THESE FAMILIES ARE TRYING 
OUT THEIR CLOTHES ON AL RAILWAY LINE 
WATER SUPPLY CUT OFF 
THIS NEW FOOTAGE SHOWS THE CYCLONE 
IN FULL FURY SATURDAY'S STORM TORE 
ITS WAY ACROSS BURMA THE WINDS 
WERE UP TO ONE TWENTY M. P. H. THE SURGE OF 
WATER WAS TWELVE F. T. HIGH THE CYCLONE 
PICKED UP SPEED AND POWER IN THE 
BAY OF BENGAL IT HIT LAND AND THEN 
MOVED NORTHEASTWARDS TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE 
DIED IN ONE TOWN AND THEN THE 
CYCLONE MOVED ONTO THE MAIN CITY 
RANGOON BEFORE DRIFTING ON TOWARDS 
THAILAND NOW NEW INFORMATION 
PROVIDED BY THE UNITED NATIONS 
SHOWS THE EXTENT OF THE FLOODING 
EVERYTHING IN BLUE HIS LAND AND 
WATER THERE ARE STRONG ECHOES OF 
THE ASIAN TSUNAMI BEFORE THIS THE 
DELTA WAS A LUSH PATCHWORK OF RICE 
PADDIES AND VILLAGES IT WAS HOME 
TO AROUND FIVE MILLION PEOPLE AND IT 
WAS BURMA'S MOST PRODUCTIVE 
FARMLAND FARMLAND FOR THE RECLUSIVE 
GENERALS THESE ARE TESTING TIMES 
STATE TELEVISION HAS SHOWN ENDLESS 
FOOTAGE OF THEM HANDING OUT AID 
BUT CRITICS SAY THEY HAVE BEEN SLOW 
TO REACT AFTER DECADES OF DEFIANCE 
THE MILITARY HAVE NOW ACKNOWLEDGED 
THE NEED OUTSIDE HELP 
THE REGION'S SHAKY INFRASTRUCTURE 
HAS BEEN CRIPPLED BRIDGES 
DESTROYED BOAT'S SUNK ROADS 
BLOCKED AN ISOLATED NATION 
DEVASTATED 
BRITAIN HAS ALREADY PLEDGED FIVE 
MILLION TO HELP THE VICTIMS OF THE 
CYCLONE BUT MONEY ALONE IS NOT 
ENOUGH AID AGENCIES SAY THEY HAVE 
TO GET THEIR PEOPLE INTO THE 
COUNTRY TO ASSESS EXACTLY WHAT'S 
NEEDED AND WHERE IT HAS TO GO SO 
FAR THE BURMESE MILITARY 
DICTATORSHIP HAS BEEN SLOW TO ALLOW 
INTERNATIONAL TEAMS IN AND AS OUR 
DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT BRIDGET 
KENDALL REPORTS THAT IS THE FIRST 
CHALLENGE 
THIS IS THE WORST NATURAL DISASTER 
TO HIT THIS PART OF ASIA SINCE THE 
TSUNAMI IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR IT STRUCK THE 
POOREST PART OF A VERY POOR COUNTRY 
THEY NEED HELP URGENTLY AND SOME 
AID IS ON ITS WAY NINE TONS OF 
FOOD AND MEDICINE FLEW INTO DAY 
FROM THAILAND TWO SUPPLY SHIPS 
HAVE SET OFF FROM INDIA AN AIDE 
HAS BEEN PROMISED FROM ACROSS THE 
WORLD INCLUDING SINGAPORE CHINA 
THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE AS 
FOR WHAT IS NEEDED AGENCIES SAY 
BOTTLED WATER AND MEDICINES ARE TOP 
PRIORITY TO STOP DISEASE SPREADING 
ALSO MOSQUITO NETS AND TENTS BUT 
WHAT IS STRIKING IS THAT THE 
MILITARY GOVERNMENT IN BURMA DOES 
SEEM READY TO ADMIT THAT IT NEEDS 
ASSISTANCE ASSISTANCE THERE HAS BEEN AN OPENNESS THAT WE 
HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED BEFORE EVEN 
AFTER THE TSUNAMI IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHEN THE 
GOVERNMENT DID NOT WANT TO RECEIVE 
INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE THIS TIME 
THEY ARE BEING VERY OPEN ABOUT IT 
THEY ARE DISCUSSING IT AND THERE 
IS A BILLING US THERE TO RECEIVE 
WHICH MUST INDICATE HOW MUCH PEOPLE 
ARE SUFFERING ON THE GROUND 
THERE IS A WILLINGNESS 
BUT GETTING 
THE AID TO THOSE WHO NEED IT IS A 
LOGISTICS NIGHTMARE JUST GETTING 
THE VISAS IS PROVING DIFFICULT 
GETTING AID TO THOSE WHO NEED IT IS 
A LOGISTICS NIGHTMARE JUST 
OBTAINING VISAS IS PROVING HARD 
ROADS AND RAILWAYS IN POOR REPAIR 
AT THE BEST OF TIMES HAVE BEEN 
BLOCKED MANY COASTAL AREAS ARE 
ISOLATED SOME VILLAGES HAVE BEEN 
WASHED AWAY SAY SOME REPORTS IT 
IS REMINISCENT OF THE PROBLEMS IN 
INDONESIA AFTER THE TSUNAMI EXCEPT 
THIS TIME THERE IS A SUSPICIOUS 
SECRETIVE MILITARY REGIME 
RELUCTANT TO LET IN TOO MANY 
OUTSIDERS REPARED TO MOVE U. S. OUTSIDERS PREPARED TO MOVE U. S. NAVY ASSETS TO HELP FIND THOSE WHO 
HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES TO HELP FIND 
THE MISSING TO HELP STABILISE THE 
SITUATION BUT IN ORDER TO DO SO 
THE MILITARY JUNTA MUST ALLOW OUR 
DISASTER ASSESSMENT TEAMS INTO THE 
COUNTRY 
THIS IS A TEST FOR BURMA'S COUNTRY GENERALS IT IS NOT SO LONG AGO 
THEY ORDERED THE VICIOUS CRACKDOWN 
ON OPPOSITION PROTESTS THEY WILL 
WORRY THAT OUTSIDE HELP MIGHT 
WEAKEN THEIR GRIP BUT IF THEY DO 
NOT LET OUTSIDE AGENCIES IN THEN 
HOPE HELP MAY NEVER REACH THE 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO NEED IT 
AND YOU CAN GET A LOT MORE ON THE 
SITUATION IN BURMA INCLUDING THE 
LATEST VIDEO AND EYE WITNESS 
REPORTS BY GOING TO THE B. B. C. NEWS 
WEBSITE 
IT WAS BILLED AS THE BIG SHAKE UP 
THAT WOULD TAKE BRITAIN'S POSTAL 
SERVICES INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BUT 
IT HASN'T WORKED OUT LIKE THAT AN 
INDEPENDENT REPORT SAYS ORDINARY 
HOUSEHOLDS AND SMALL BUSINESSES 
HAVE LOST OUT SINCE THE ROYAL MAIL 
WAS OPENED UP TO COMPETITION 
HERE'S HUGH PYM 
THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION TEXTING 
E. MAIL INTERNET SHOPPING IT IS 
TRANSFORMING THE WAY WE USE POSTAL 
SERVICES AND THAT IS THE 
BACKGROUND TO THIS INDEPENDENT 
REVIEW OF THE INDUSTRY THE REPORT 
LOOKS AT KEY ISSUES AND MAJOR 
CHANGES IN THE MALE MARKET FIRST 
OF ALL COMPETITION IT SAYS BULK 
MAIL USERS ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE 
BENEFITED THEY HAVE SEEN PRICES 
FALL BECAUSE PRIVATE POST COMPANIES 
ARE COMPETING TO PROCESS THEIR MAIL 
BUT SMALLER FIRMS AND HOUSEHOLDS 
HAVE NOT SEEN CHANGES TO THE WAY 
THEIR POST IS COLLECTED AND 
DELIVERED ROYAL MILE STILL HAS THE 
MONOPOLY MONOPOLY THERE IS NO DOUBT IN ANY COMPANY 
YOU HAVE TO MODERNISE TO 
ACCOMMODATE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE 
MARKETPLACE AND ROYAL MAIL CLEARLY 
NEEDS TO DO THAT THE SOONER THAT 
HAPPENS THE BETTER 
WHAT'S MORE 
STAMP PRICES HAVE GONE UP SIX P. FOR 
BOAST FIRST CLASS AND SECOND CLASS 
SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE FOR BOTH ALTHOUGH 
ROYAL MILE HAS MET QUALITY TARGETS 
COLLECTIONS AND DELIVERIES HAVE 
BEEN REDUCED TO ONE PER DAY 
WE DO 
NOT GET THE SUNDAY COLLECTIONS NOW 
WE DON'T GET TWO DELIVERIES IN A 
DAY MINE IS TERRIBLY LATE 
WE HAVE 
NOT GOT A CHOICE ONE WAY OR THE 
OTHER WE ARE STUCK WITH THAT ONE 
OR NOTHING REALLY WHAT DO YOU DO 
AND THERE IS THE QUESTION OF ROYAL 
MAIL PROFITS OR LACK OF THEM IT 
IS NOW LOSING MONEY THE REVIEW 
SAYS THE PENSION DEFICIT IS MAJOR 
FINANCIAL BURDEN AND INDUSTRIAL 
RELATIONS PROBLEMS HAVE STOOD IN 
THE WAY OF MODERNISATION 
WE STAND 
UP FOR OUR MEMBERS WHEN IT IS WHITE 
TO DO SO WE WILL DO THAT AGAIN 
SOON ON PENSIONS BUT WE ARE UP FOR 
CHANGE RIGHT 
ROYAL MAIL'S FINANCIAL POSITION IS 
UNDER THREAT AND ITS ABILITY TO 
PROVIDE A UNIVERSAL SERVICE ACROSS 
THE U. K. IS ALSO UNDER THREAT IT IS 
UNCOMFORTABLE READING FOR THE 
MINISTERS WHO COMMISSIONED THIS 
REPORT 
THE INDEPENDENT POLICE COMPLAINTS 
COMMISSION HAS UPHELD FOUR 
ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT MADE 
AGAINST THE FORMER CHIEF CONSTABLE 
OF DOVEDD POWYS POLICE TERRY 
GRANGE THE ALLEGATIONS INCLUDE 
FAILING TO ATTEND MEETINGS BECAUSE

THE B. B. C. HAS UNEARTHED YET MORE 
EVIDENCE OF BRUTAL ATTACKS AGAINST 
OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS IN ZIMBABWE 
WITH THE COUNTRY'S ELECTION 
COMMISSION SAYING THERE HAS TO BE A 
RUN OFF BETWEEN ROBERT MUGABE AND 
OPPOSITION LEADER MORGAN TSANGIRAI 
THE RULING PARTY HAS LAUNCHED 
CAMPAIGN OF INTIMIDATION B. B. C. NEWS 
IS BANNED FROM ZIMBABWE SO ORLA 
GUERIN WENT UNDERCOVER FOR THIS 
REPORT 
MUCH OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN 
ZIMBABWE IS HIDDEN FROM VIEW JUST 
THE WAY PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE 
LIKES IT BUT HERE IN THE RURAL 
AREAS THERE IS NEW HARVEST OF 
FEAR PLANTED BY THE RULING PARTY 
AND ITS HENCHMEN WE TRAVELLED DEEP 
INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE TO GET THE 
FULL PICTURE AND THIS IS HOW IT 
LOOKS BATTERED AND BRUISED THIS 
WOMAN ATTACKED ON HER OWN DOORSTEP 
WE HAVE DECIDED TO CONCEAL HER 
IDENTITY 
THEY WERE BEATING ME 
ON THE CHEEK AND ONE KICKED ME ON 
THE FACE ALSO HE HIT ME ON THE 
HEAD 
THE AIM IS ELECTORAL HEAD CLEANSING TO DRIVE OPPOSITION 
SUPPORTERS OUT OF THE VOTING AREAS 
TO MAKE THEM TOO AFRAID TO VOTE FOR 
THE M. D. C. AGAIN IN THIS OPPOSITION 
STRONGHOLD WE MET LOCAL LEADERS 
WHO EXPLAINED THE MECHANICS OF THE 
CAMPAIGN THEY SAY IT IS LED BY 
RULING PARTY OFFICIALS SO CALLED 
WAR VETERANS AND A SENIOR ARMY 
OFFICER 
THEY TOLD US THAT IF WE DID NOT 
VOTE FOR ZANU P. F. AND PRESIDENT 
MUGABE LOST THERE WOULD BE WAR 
SAYS THIS MAN THE INTIMIDATION 
BEGAN AT THE TOP THEY SAY WITH 
LOCAL CHIEFS WHO PASS THE THREATS 
DOWN TO THE VILLAGE ELDERS THE 
HEAD MAN TOLD US THE MESSAGE FROM 
ZANU P. F. WAS TO GO AND TELL THE 
PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT 
THE ACCOUNTS WE HAVE HEARD HERE ARE 
CONSISTENT WITH THOSE FROM 
ELSEWHERE THERE IS A SYSTEMATIC 
ATTEMPT UNDER WAY TO ALTER THE 
ELECTORAL LANDSCAPE THESE LEADERS 
HAVE TOLD US IT WON'T WORK HERE 
THEIR COMMUNITIES WOULD BE UP 
WON'T BE INTIMIDATED BUT HUMAN 
RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ARE WORRIED THAT 
IN OTHER PLACES FEAR IS ALREADY 
TAKING HOLD AND THERE IS ANOTHER 
WEAPON IN THIS CAMPAIGN HUNGER 
THE CROP IS DEAD IN THE FIELDS 
PEOPLE HERE DESPERATELY NEED MAIZE 
BUT THEY SAY WITHOUT A PARTY CARD 
THEY WON'T GET IT ONE MORE WAY 
ROBERT MUGABE IS WEAKENING THE 
OPPOSITION BEFORE THE SECOND ROUND 
MANY WHO LONG FOR CHANGE HAVE BEEN 
FORCED INTO THE SHADOWS HIDING OUT 
IN PLACES LIKE THIS HOMELESS AND 
FORCE LESS THIS MAN IS RISKING HIS 
LIFE TO HELP THEM HE DARES NOT 
SLEEP AT HOME SO HERE IS WAY HE 
LAYS HIS HEAD WHERE THIS IS A 
COUNTRY WHERE FEAR IS REPLACING

UNDERGO AMERICA'S MOST FAMOUS 
OLYMPIAN WHO HIMSELF WAS THE 
CENTRE OF DRUG ALLEGATIONS

GET THE TRUTH 
AMERICA BELIEVES IT 
HAS FOUND A SYSTEM TO CATCH CHEATS 
IN STARS LIKE ALISON PHOENIX TO 
SHOW THAT THEIR ATHLETES CAN BE 
CLEAN CLEAN HERE DAVID CAMERON SAYS HE WILL 
MAKE THE ROW OVER THE SCRAPPING OF 
THE TEN P. TAX RATE A KEY CAMPAIGN 
ISSUE IN THE CREWE AND NANTWICH BY 
ELECTION HE WAS THERE KEEPING UP 
THE PRESSURE ON GORDON BROWN 
FOLLOWING THE CONSERVATIVE'S 
SUCCESS IN THE LOCAL ELECTIONS THE 
BY ELECTION HAS BEEN CAUSED BY THE 
DEATH OF THE LABOUR M. P. GWYNETH 
DUNWOODY CAROLE WALKER IS IN 
WESTMINSTER SO THE TORIES ARE 
MILKING THIS TEN P. TAX ISSUE FOR ALL 
IT IS WORTH 
THAT IS RIGHT DAVID 
CAMERON WAS ON THE STREETS OF CREWE 
TODAY MAKING IT CLEAR HE'LL 
EXPLOIT THOSE DIFFICULTIES TO THE 
MAXIMUM EVEN THOUGH THE 
CONSERVATIVES HAVE NOT SAID WHAT 
THEY WOULD DO ABOUT THIS TEN P. TAX 
RATE ONE VOTER TACKLED THE LEAD 
TORE SAY WOULD HE REINSTATE THE TEN P. 
BAND 
YOU ARE ELECTED AS PRIME BAND MINISTER OF THIS COUNTRY THAT IS 
WHAT PEOPLE IN CREWE AND NANTWICH 
WANT THAT IS WHAT THE PEOPLE OF 
THIS COUNTRY ARE LOOKING TO YOU 
THE POTENTIAL FUTURE LEADER YOU 
BEING THE LEAD ORE OF THIS COUNTRY 
YOU VA THE POWER HE HAS THE POWER 
TO PUT IT BACK 
PEOPLE IN CREWE AND 
NANTWICH CANNOT WAIT TWO YEARS FOR 
A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT THEY 
WANT ACTION NOW YOU CAN GET ACTION 
NOW IF WE SEND A BIG ENOUGH MESSAGE 
TO GORDON BROWN TO SAY HE WILL HELP 
THOSE FIFTY THREE MILLION PEOPLE WHAT WHAT ABOUT GORDON BROWN WHAT ABOUT THE 
LABOUR FIGHTBACK 
THAT IS THE 
QUESTION A LOT OF LABOUR M. P.'S ARE 
ASKING THEY WANT TO SEE TANGIBLE 
SIGNS OF THAT FIGHT BACK WHAT IT 
MEANS FOR THAT TEN P. TAX RATE THEY 
ARE DUBIOUS THAT GORDON BROWN WILL 
BE ABLE TO DELIVER THE NEW 
DIRECTION THE NEW POLICIES THAT 
NAY REALLY WANT INTERESTING TO SEE 
CHARLES CLARK SETTING OUT AN 
ALTERNATIVE AGENDA NOT A 
LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE BUT I THINK 
AT THE MOMENT M. P.'S ARE FEELING 
DISMAL PRETTY GLOOMY THEY THINK 
BEFORE THAT FIGHTBACK BEGINS GORDON 
BROWN WILL BE HIT BY SOME MORE 
PUNISHING BLOWS STARTING POSSIBLY 
WITH A DEFEAT AT THAT BY ELECTION 
IN CREWE AND NANTWICH 
THANK YOU 
THERE ARE MORE C. C. T. V. CAMERAS IN THE

BOYFRIEND TO DEATH IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO KNOW HOW MANY C. C. T. V. CAMERAS THERE 
ONE STUDY RECKONS UP TO FOUR AND A 
HALF MILLION MOST OWNED PRIVATELY 
THAT MEANS YOU CAN BE OBSERVED ON 
C. C. T. V. AS MANY AS THREE HUNDRED TIMES IN A 
SINGLE DAY WHAT FRUSTRATES THE 
POLICE IS THE WAY THESE CAMERAS 
HAVE MUSHROOMED IN A PIECEMEAL 
UNCORD NAITDED WAY 
THERE IS NO 
DATABASE OF IMAGES OF PEOPLE 
WHILST WE HAVE THE IMAGES THE 
DIFFICULTY IS IDENTIFYING WHO IT IS
