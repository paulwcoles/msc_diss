SUZI LIVES IN THE BASEMENT OF A LARGE GEORGIAN HOUSE 
I AM ASHAMED BUT I HAVE NO CHOICE 
IF I SPEND A LOT OF MONEY JUST TO RENT A BEAUTIFUL PLACE I CANNOT SEND TO MY FAMILY 
YOU SEE MY ROOM NO LOCK 
JUST A WAREHOUSE 
SHE ARRIVED IN THE U. K. EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO 
IT'S VERY SMALL 
IT'S DARK 
I JUST MAKE IT LOOK LIKE BEAUTIFUL 
HOW MUCH DOES THIS COST 
NOW FIFTY FIVE 
A WEEK YEAH 
SUZI IS A MOTHER OF FOUR SONS BACK HOME IN THE PHILIPPINES 
NINETEEN THIS NOVEMBER THIS THIS IS TEN THIS IS EIGHT AND THIS IS SIX 
SHE IS ONE OF EIGHT MILLION FILIPINOS WHO LEAVE THEIR COUNTRY TO FIND WORK AND SEND MONEY HOME 
SHE EARNS THREE HUNDRED A WEEK FROM HER VARIOUS CLEANING JOBS 
SUZI IS PAYING FOR HER CHILDREN'S EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES WHERE STATE PROVISION IS POOR 
BUT THE ONE THING YOU CAN'T GIVE THEM IS A HUG 
THE ONE THING I CANNOT GIVE TO THEM NOW IS MY PRESENCE 
BECAUSE I'M VERY FAR 
BUT ALMOST EVERY DAY I CALL 
HELLO 
SO WHO'S THIS D'YOU WANT TO TELL ME 
THAT'S MY SON MY YOUNGEST SON AND THIS ONE'S MY TEN YEARS OLD SON JEREMY 
AND THIS IS JUSTIN 
HELLO JUSTIN 
WE CAN HAVE A TEAM BASKETBALL TEAM 
HE WILL DO HIS BEST TO STUDY HARD AND HE SAID HE MISSED ME 
HE WISH ALSO THAT WE WERE TOGETHER 
OH 
O. K. BYE BYE 
LOVE YOU 
AUTUMN LEAVES 
HE SENT TO ME 
JUANA IS ALSO FROM THE PHILIPPINES 
TO SUPPORT HER FAMILY SHE'S BEEN WORKING AS A DOMESTIC IN LONDON FOR TWENTY YEARS 
SHE HAS TWELVE SIBLINGS TO WHOM SHE SENDS MONEY REGULARLY 
BUT LAST YEAR ONE OF HER BROTHERS BECAME SERIOUSLY ILL WITH DIABETES 
WITH A POOR PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE IN THE PHILIPPINES JUANA HAD TO PAY FOR HIS TREATMENT 
DESPITE THE SUPPORT HER BROTHER EVENTUALLY SLIPPED INTO A COMA AND DIED 
SO DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOU OWED AT THE END OF IT ALL THEN JUANA 
MOST OF THE DEBT WAS INTEREST ON SEVEN CREDIT CARDS 
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE SHE LOST HER JOB 
SHE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY 
SUZI IS WORKING AND SENDING MONEY HOME 
HER WEEKLY WAGE IS TEN TIMES MORE THAN SHE WOULD EARN IN THE PHILIPPINES 
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE 
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT FILIPINOS WORKING ABROAD SEND HOME FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION A YEAR 
THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FILIPINOS LIVING IN LONDON 
AND MANY SPEND YEARS AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES SO GETTING TOGETHER IS VERY IMPORTANT 
JUANA IS ORGANISING THE BUS TRIP 
YOUR CHILD IS HERE AND THEN YOU'RE BEHIND SO 
THEY'RE NICE PEOPLE REALLY 
VERY NICE PEOPLE 
THEY'VE GOT HEARTS OF GOLD THEY'D DO ANYTHING FOR ANYBODY 
SUZI IS ALSO HELPING OUT 
WHAT IS THE RAFFLE 
YAY 
O. K. TWELVE THIRTY FOR LUNCH BACK TO THE COACH 
MANY FILIPINOS COME TO WORK AS NURSES AND DOMESTICS 
I'M WORKING IN HAMMERSMITH HOSPITAL AT THE MOMENT 
WHAT DO YOU DO 
OH JUST WORKING IN THE HOUSE WITH TWO CHILDREN 
I'M A NURSE OH YOU'RE A NURSE YEAH 
WHAT DO YOU DO 
OH I'M A NANNY ARE YOU YEAH 
YEAH 
IT'LL GIVE YOU A STOMACH ACHE YEAH 
AND LIKE ANY TRADITIONAL DAY OUT IN THE PHILIPPINES IT ENDS WITH A PICNIC 
ANOTHER GROUP OF IMMIGRANTS IS THE ROMA 
THERE ARE AT LEAST TWELVE THOUSAND LIVING IN LONDON 
THIS GROUP COME FROM POLAND AND THEY'RE GATHERING TO AUDITION FOR A TALENT SHOW 
THE ROMA PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VICTIMISED FOR CENTURIES 
HALF A MILLION WERE KILLED IN THE NAZI DEATH CAMPS 
I WILL START THE PROCEDURE BY CHOOSING 
WHO WILL BE STARTING FIRST ON THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER 
THE ORGANISER OF THE SHOW IS ZORBA 
HE CAME FROM POLAND WITH HIS FAMILY WHEN HE WAS TEN YEARS OLD 
RAISA KATCHITZA 
O. K. WE'RE GOING TO AUDITION THIS KID NOW COS HE DIDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY 
HIS DAD DIED RECENTLY 
AND HE COULDN'T MAKE IT AT THE AUDITION SO WE'RE NOW GOING TO GIVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO THROUGH 
ADRIAN IS ELEVEN YEARS OLD 
AND IT WAS HIS FATHER WHO TAUGHT HIM HOW TO PLAY THE VIOLIN 
BACK HOME IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO FIND WORK 
AND ALSO THERE WAS A LOT OF RACIAL HARASSMENT 
IT'S VERY MUCH NORMAL THAT ONE JUST TURNS AROUND AT ONE TIME 
AND SAYS THAT'S IT THAT'S ENOUGH I'M NOT HAVING IT ANY MORE 
THAT'S HOW A LOT OF MY FAMILY USED TO MAKE THEIR LIVING IN POLAND 
THEY WERE MUSICIANS 
IT WAS TOO DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO FIND A JOB 
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEY WERE SLIGHTLY DARKER THAN THE NORMAL POLISH PERSON 
SO THEY USED TO GO ROUND CREATING BANDS AND PLAYING FOR PEOPLE 
GOOD HE'S MADE IT HE'S JUST SO GOOD 
AND THE MAN WHO PLAYED WITH HIM IS A FANTASTIC MUSICIAN 
SO I ASSUME HE'S GOOD ENOUGH HE'S WAY GOOD ENOUGH TO GO ON 
O. K. HERE WE GO DENNIS 
SUZI DOESN'T JUST SEND MONEY HOME 
THIS IS FOR THE BOYS MY NEPHEWS SHIRTS 
THIS IS FOR MY ELDEST SON JOSHUA 
AND HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOU SPEND BUYING THESE THINGS 
OH PLENTY IS IT NOT CHEAPER TO BUY THE CLOTHES IN THE PHILIPPINES 
THEY WANT OF COURSE IMPORTED FROM LONDON 
THIS IS THE BOX I AM GOING TO SEND 
THIS HERE YEAH 
SENDING PRESENTS HOME IS KNOWN AS BALIKBAYAN 
AND IS A WAY OF EASING THE PAIN OF SEPARATION 
I SEND THESE MAGAZINES BECAUSE THEY WANT THESE MAGAZINES 
THEY THEY LIKE TO READ MAGAZINES AND THESE BOOKS 
COOKING COOKBOOK 
THIS IS GOING TO COST YOU A FORTUNE TO SEND 
OH EIGHTY FIVE ONE BOX 
JUANA HAS A WELCOME DISTRACTION FROM THE LOOMING BANKRUPTCY HEARING 
SHE HAS BEEN INVITED TO A WEDDING 
DID YOUR FRIEND BUY THIS FOR YOU SPECIALLY FOR THE WEDDING 
HUH YOUR FRIEND BOUGHT YOU THIS OUTFIT

ZORBA IS STRUGGLING TO FIND A VENUE FOR THE TALENT SHOW 
I THINK I LIKE THIS PLACE ACTUALLY VERY MUCH 
IF I WAS A PERFORMER I WOULD FEEL VERY PROFESSIONAL

IT'S SLIGHTLY LATE FOR US BUT I MEAN AT THE END OF THE DAY WE CAN THINK ABOUT IT 
THANK YOU 
THEY DID HAVE AN EARLIER BOOKING BUT THE VENUE PULLED OUT 
VERY BRIEFLY PEOPLE ARE STEREOTYPICAL 
AND WE'RE ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES IN THIS COUNTRY THAT ARE GETTING TARGETED 
BY ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY 
AND WHO KNOWS MAYBE IT WAS STEREOTYPICAL BECAUSE WE ARE ROMA 
BUT MAYBE IT WASN'T AND I HOPE IT WASN'T 
BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS NOT TO GET A PLACE A VENUE 
BECAUSE OF WHERE YOU'RE FROM OR WHAT CULTURE YOU HAVE ETC 
NOW THAT ADRIAN IS IN THE TALENT SHOW HIS FAMILY GET TOGETHER FOR A PRACTICE 
ARE YOU COUSINS YOU AND ADRIAN 
HE'S MY COUSIN'S SON
