THIS POOR OLD BONNET HAS BREATHED ITS LAST 
MY DEAREST FANNY 
NOTHING COULD BE MORE INTRIGUING THAN YOUR LATEST LETTER 
SUCH A DESCRIPTION OF YOUR QUEER LITTLE HEART 
THIS NEW YOUNG MAN YOU ADORE IS HE THE ONE 
IF WE COULD ONLY SEE INTO THE FUTURE AND KNOW IN ADVANCE IF OUR CHOICES WILL TURN OUT TO BE WISE 
ALAS YOU FACE THE MOST MOMENTOUS DECISION OF YOUR LIFE WITH ONLY YOUR AUNT JANE TO ADVISE YOU 
COME TO YOUR COUSIN'S WEDDING 
PREPARED TO DISCUSS EVERY DELICIOUS DETAIL 
LOOK MERCIFULLY UPON THESE THY SERVANTS 
THAT THIS WOMAN MAY BE LOVING AND AMIABLE FAITHFUL AND OBEDIENT TO HER HUSBAND 
OH LORD BLESS THEM BOTH 
AUNT JANE YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME DECIDE BECAUSE I CAN'T

FATHER 
FATHER TELL AUNT JANE SHE'S GOT TO COME TO KENT 
PLEASE I'M DYING TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF HIM 
THERE MAY BE AUNT WHO COULD RESIST SUCH AN INVITATION BUT I AM NOT THAT AUNT 
I JUST DON'T THINK YOU'VE GOT ANY CHANCE OF GETTING ME TO THE ALTAR 
I'M EXPECTING A PROPOSAL AT ANY MOMENT 
OH THAT'S SUCH A SILLY OLD JOKE 
LEARN FROM ME FANNY ALL ANY GENTLEMAN NEEDS IS AN OPPORTUNITY 
MR. PAPILLON 
MISS AUSTEN LOVELY SERVICE 
MISS AUSTEN HOW KIND YOU ARE HOW VERY KIND 
MY HUMBLE EFFORTS NO MATCH FOR YOUR INTELLECT I'M SURE 
SURPRISINGLY ROMANTIC 
I WOULD HAVE EVERYONE MARRY IF THEY COULD DON'T YOU AGREE 
SAINT PAUL HIMSELF TELLS US IT'S BETTER TO MARRY THAN BURN WHO COULD RESIST 
I'M CONVINCED MR. PAPILLON 
THAT THERE'S NOT A SINGLE FREEBORN ENGLISH LADY EVEN THE MOST UNLIKELY SPINSTER 
WHO COULD FAIL TO FIND HAPPINESS IF ONLY OUR ENGLISH GENTLEMEN WOULD SEIZE THE MOMENT 
ANY MOMENT REALLY 
OH VERY CLEVER I'M SURE 
WHAT A LOVELY SERVICE LOVELY 
GOOD DAY TO YOU LADIES 
JANE 
SILENCED BY THE FORCE OF HIS PASSION 
YOU SHOULDN'T TORMENT THE POOR FELLOW 
LIKE A CAT WITH A MOUSE AND IT'S CRUEL 
MR. PAPILLON IS SUCH A DRY OLD STICK I'M SURE HE DOESN'T NOTICE 
ANYWAY I'M A VICAR'S DAUGHTER 
WHY SHOULDN'T I MAKE A CHARMING VICAR'S WIFE 
AND YOU SET A BAD EXAMPLE TO OUR NIECE 
THE CHILD IS DELIGHTFUL 
TO THINK OF HER MARRIED TO AN ORDINARY GENTLEMAN IN KENT 
EVERYONE FROM KENT IS ALWAYS QUITE AGREEABLE 
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO BE VERY AGREEABLE IT SAVES ME THE TROUBLE OF LIKING THEM 
ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE TIME FOR THAT IN KENT I'LL MAKE TIME 
HELP ME CAT I'LL BE LATE 
WRITE TO ME EVERY DAY 
THINK OF ALL THE NEW PEOPLE SHE MIGHT MEET MOTHER 
YOU YOU TURNED YOUR FACE TO THE WALL YEARS AGO 
BUT JANE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL ME SHE'S NOT INTERESTED IN GENTLEMEN 
SHE'S MET ALL THE GENTLEMEN IN KENT 
OH YOU GIRLS 
WHAT IF THERE'S SOMEONE BETTER 
WHAT IF I MARRY MR. PLUMPTREE AND I NEVER MEET HIM 
SOMEONE BETTER I MEAN 
WHAT IF I PASS HIM ON THE STREET AND I NEVER KNOW THAT HE WAS THE ONE 
AND WHAT IF YOU DO MEET HIM AND HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY MONEY 
BUT IF I LOVED HIM THEN NOTHING ELSE WOULD MATTER 
IN HEAVEN'S NAME WHAT GAVE YOU THAT IDEA 
IT SAYS SO IN ONE OF YOUR BOOKS 
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK THEY SAY MY DEAR PERHAPS YOU SHOULD READ THEM AGAIN 
WHAT'S WORSE DO YOU THINK 
TO MARRY THE WRONG MAN OR TO DIE A LONELY OLD MAID 
THERE ARE WORSE THINGS TO DIE OF 
YOU'RE NOT OLD I SHALL SOON BE FORTY THAT'S ALMOST OLD ENOUGH TO BOAST ABOUT 
WELL WE MUST LOOK FOR A WEALTHY OLD WIDOWER WITH SIX CHILDREN OH VERY ATTRACTIVE 
I BET YOU HAD HUNDREDS OF PROPOSALS WHEN YOU WERE MY AGE 
THOUSANDS I BET EVERY YOUNG MAN IN THE VICINITY PINED WITH LONGING 
ALAS NOT FOR ME 
YOU MUST'VE BEEN ASKED 
I NEVER WAS MY DEAR 
I'M SIMPLY A MISTRESS OF ALL THE THEORY 
AND DESPITE THE SHAME OF BEING OLD I'M QUITE HAPPY TO BE SO 
IT'S MUCH LESS MESSY WERE YOU REALLY NEVER IN LOVE 
THE TRUTH IS FANNY 
AND THIS MUST BE OUR SECRET 
YOU MUST NEVER TELL ANYONE 
THE TRUTH IS 
I AM SHE THAT LOVED AND LOST 
WHO WAS HE TELL ME 
I LOVED AND LOST AND PINED AND YEARNED 
AND THEN SWORE MYSELF TO SOLITUDE AND THE CONSOLATIONS OF WRITING ABOUT IT INSTEAD 
DID YOU REALLY 
YOU READ FAR TOO MANY NOVELS 
HELLO 
NERVE WRACKING THE IDEA SHE MIGHT MAKE THE WRONG CHOICE OF HUSBAND 
ALAS FOR FOND FATHERS EVERYWHERE 
THE DAYS OF ARRANGED MARRIAGES ARE LONG GONE 
IT'S HARD FOR THE POOR CHILD WITHOUT A MOTHER TO GUIDE HER 
YOU KNOW SHE WILL ACCEPT HIM IF HE HAS YOUR BLESSING 
THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF AN AUNT ARE BOTTOMLESS 
WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HE ADORE ME 
COLOURED PETTICOATS AND FLOUNCES NOW 
WE'VE HAD FLOUNCES FOR AGES IT'S QUITE SHORT 
WELL IF YOURS IS TOO LONG I'LL TAKE MY SCISSORS TO IT DON'T YOU DARE 
OH I'LL JUST DIE ON THE SPOT IF YOU DON'T LIKE MR. PLUMPTREE 
I'M WEAK WITH ADORATION ALREADY 
PLEASE DON'T EXPECT A MR. DARCY 
MY DARLING GIRL THIS IS THE REAL WORLD 
THE ONLY WAY TO GET A MAN LIKE MR. DARCY IS TO MAKE HIM UP 
I DO LONG FOR THE DAY WHEN EVERYONE OF US ON EARTH CAN TURN AWAY 
FROM SHALLOW WORLDLY DESIRES 
BELIEVING REJOICING THAT OUR LORD WILL REWARD US IN HEAVEN 
IN THE MEANTIME HOWEVER IN THE MEANTIME A WRITER LIKE YOURSELF 
IS IN SUCH A POWERFUL POSITION TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BE VIRTUOUS 
AND THAT IS WHY PLEASE DON'T BE OFFENDED MISS AUSTEN WHY IT WORRIES ME 
THAT SO MANY OF YOUR MEN OF RELIGION ARE FIGURES OF FUN 
MY MOTHER 
MY MOTHER LOVES MY FOOLISH VICARS 
BUT I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER A VICAR 
YES 
A REAL VICAR 
WHEREAS MY FOOLISH VICARS ARE 
ARE ALL MADE UP DO YOU SEE 
THEY'RE JUST STORIES 
A CLERGYMAN HAS NOTHING TO DO BUT BE SLOVENLY AND SELFISH 
READ THE NEWSPAPER WATCH THE WEATHER AND QUARREL WITH HIS WIFE 
MANSFIELD PARK 
HAVE MERCY ON HIM FANNY 
DO NOT OBLIGE POOR MR. PLUMPTREE TO LISTEN TO ANY MORE OF MY RAMBLINGS 
I COULD WRITE A BOOK PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DO SO 
AND I WILL PUT MYSELF ON THE SOFA BY THE FIRE AND DRINK AS MUCH WINE AS I WANT 
WELL HE'S HANDSOME ISN'T HE 
AND HIS RELIGIOUS FAITH IS A POINT IN HIS FAVOUR 
I LIKE HIS QUIET GENTLEMAN LIKE MANNERS 
SENSIBLE RATHER THAN BRILLIANT 
THERE IS NOBODY BRILLIANT NOWADAYS 
WILL YOU RECOMMEND HIM 
GOOD LORD WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT ANY OF IT 
PRECISELY 
NEVERTHELESS 
GIRLS OF TWENTY ARE SO DESPERATE TO BE IN LOVE 
IT'S SO HARD TO TELL IF IT'S REAL 
EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE CHANCE TO MARRY ONCE FOR LOVE 
IF THEY CAN 
EDWARD 
ANYTHING WRONG 
FANNY AND I MUST VISIT OUR NEIGHBOURS 
DON'T WORRY YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME 
MY DARLING CASSANDRA 
DO NOT IMAGINE I HAVE ANY REAL OBJECTION TO MR. PLUMPTREE 
I HAVE RATHER TAKEN A FANCY TO HIM THAN NOT 
NOW HOWEVER I AM ALL ALONE 
WHAT HAPPINESS 
AT THIS PRESENT TIME I HAVE FIVE TABLES EIGHT AND TWENTY CHAIRS AND TWO FIRES ALL TO MYSELF 
I AM MISTRESS OF ALL I SURVEY 
SO WHERE SHALL I BEGIN 
WHICH OF MY IMPORTANT NOTHINGS SHALL I TELL YOU FIRST 
HELLO 
EDWARD 
EDWARD 
GOOD LORD 
MISS AUSTEN 
MR. BRIDGES 
WHAT A LOVELY SURPRISE 
WERE WE EXPECTING YOU 
ER I'M LATE PROBABLY OR EARLY 
I WAS JUST ON MY WAY BACK TO RAMSGATE 
THEN I CAN SEE EXACTLY WHY YOU MIGHT WANT TO DELAY YOUR ARRIVAL AS LONG AS IS DECENT 
IT'S MY WIFE 
HER HEALTH'S NOT STRONG SHE NEEDS THE SEA AIR 
THEN THEN RAMSGATE'S JUST THE PLACE 
FANNY AND EDWARD WILL BE BACK IN TIME FOR DINNER 
OH TILL THEN DON'T LET ME DISTURB YOUR WRITING 
OH NO IT'S JUST A LETTER TO MY SISTER I CAN FINISH IT LATER 
BY WHICH TIME THANKS TO YOUR APPEARANCE ITS CONTENTS WILL BE FAR MORE INTERESTING TO HER 
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED AT ALL 
NO IT'S TRUE RAMSGATE IS NOT THE MOST ELEGANT OF SEASIDE TOWNS 
BUT HARRIET FINDS THE AIR SUITS HER 
MY ADVICE FOR A HAPPY STAY IN RAMSGATE 
IS TO KEEP YOUR FACE FIRMLY SOUTH TOWARD THE SEA 
AND YOUR BACK THEREFORE NORTH TOWARDS RAMSGATE KEEPING MY LIFE WHERE I CAN'T SEE IT 
I MIGHT FIND SERVICES RATHER DIFFICULT TO CONDUCT 
DEARLY BELOVED WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND A HOWLING GALE FROM FRANCE 
ARE YOU HAPPY IN RAMSGATE MR. BRIDGES 
YES 
ARE YOU HAPPY IN HAMPSHIRE MISS AUSTEN 
YES 
I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT YOU'D LEFT BATH 
DREADFUL MULTITUDE OF UGLY WOMEN IN BATH 
AND AS FOR THE MEN 
MR. BRIDGES I BARELY WROTE A USEFUL WORD IN TEN YEARS 
THEN WE WALKED INTO THE COTTAGE IN HAMPSHIRE 
AND I KNEW WE'D NEVER LEAVE 
I KNEW MY MOTHER WOULD BE HAPPY AND MY SISTER WOULD BE COMFORTABLE 
YOU'VE LEFT SOMEONE OUT 
AND I WOULD BE FREE TO WRITE 
THINGS ALWAYS TURN OUT FOR THE BEST 
DON'T YOU AGREE 
PERHAPS 
SHALL I SAY YES TO HIM IF HE ASKS ME HAS HE ASKED YOU NO BUT WHEN HE DOES 
BECAUSE AUNT JANE THE WORST THING IS WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT YEARS TILL HE FINISHES HIS STUDIES 
SO YOU LIKE HIM WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM BUT NOT ENOUGH TO WAIT ER MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ME 
ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH HIM OF COURSE BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT 
THAT'S AN AWFUL LOT OF BREATH WE'VE BOTH BEEN WASTING 
THERE YOU JUST ADMITTED IT LOVE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
BUT NOT THE ONLY IMPORTANT THING THERE'S MONEY AND POSITION AND FAMILY 
AND FRIENDSHIP AND PASSION AND SHARED PURPOSE 
FANNY 
DO ANYTHING BUT MARRY WITHOUT AFFECTION 
STOP 
THERE 
NOW YOU CAN TURN DOWN ALL THE MARRIAGEABLE MEN IN KENT 
I SHALL BE AS POLITE TO THEM AS THEIR BAD BREATH WILL ALLOW 
FANNY MY DEAR SO GROWN UP 
MR. LUSHINGTON 
MY SISTER MISS AUSTEN JANE MAY I PRESENT MR. STEPHEN LUSHINGTON 
MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR CANTERBURY 
I'M THRILLED TO FIND YOU AS CHARMING IN PERSON AND YOU ARE ON PAGE MISS AUSTEN 
I HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING YET 
DISCERNING ELEMENTS OF THE PALACE OF WESTMINSTER QUEUE UP FOR THE CHANCE OF MEETING YOU 
SHALL I BE STARED AT LIKE A WILD BEAST IN A ZOO 
A WILD BEAST CAUGHT IN MY NET RIGHT HERE IN THIS LIBRARY 
JUST WHERE YOU BELONG 
SURROUNDED AND SUPPORTED BY THE WISDOM OF THE ANCIENTS 
WITH AWE AROUND THESE SILENT WALKS I TREAD 
THESE ARE THE LASTING MANSIONS OF THE DEAD 
YOU LIKE GEORGE CRABBE I ALWAYS KEEP A COPY OF CRABBE IN MY POCKET 
FOR WHEN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS BECOMES TOO TEDIOUS 
I HOPE YOU MEAN CRABBE IN ONE POCKET 
PRIDE AND PREJUDICE IN THE OTHER 
MANSFIELD PARK BENEATH MY HAT 
SENSE AND SENSIBILITY TUCKED UNDER MY ARM 
OH 
AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO PUT MY EMMA 
A NEW HEROINE 
MY DEAR MISS AUSTEN YOU MUST ALLOW ME TO MONOPOLISE YOUR ATTENTION SHAMELESSLY TILL THE END OF DINNER 
AND BEYOND 
BUT IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT 
IT'S GONE MIDNIGHT IT'S SUNDAY THE LORD'S DAY 
PLEASE FANNY IT'S PAST THE TIME FOR DANCING 
YOUR SISTERS ARE DANCING SHOWING THEIR THICK ANKLES 
RESCUE POOR AUNT JANE 
SHE DOESN'T LOOK TO ME LIKE SOMEONE WHO NEEDS RESCUING 
SHE'S HAVING MORE FUN THAN ME AND IT'S MY HOUSE 
I'M GOING TO BED 
FANNY 
I'M AN ASS 
I KNOW I AM AND A VERY BAD GUEST 
PLEASE FORGIVE ME 
ONLY IF YOU ABANDON EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR PRINCIPLES AND DANCE WITH ME IMMEDIATELY 
MISS KNIGHT MAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF THIS DANCE 
ONCE WHEN YOU WERE VERY LITTLE I OPENED THE DANCING AT A RATHER GRAND BALL WITH YOUR UNCLE BROOK 
NEAR ESCAPE THERE AUNT JANE YOU COULD'VE ENDED UP A VICAR'S WIFE IN RAMSGATE 
FAR TOO MANY BEAUTIFUL YOUNG MEN HERE FANNY 
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY CHOOSE ONE 
YOU LET THAT HORRID POLITICIAN FLIRT WITH YOU ALL NIGHT 
I'M RATHER IN LOVE WITH HIM MM HMM 
HE'S CLEVER AND A MAN OF GREAT TASTE 
AMBITIOUS AND INSINCERE 
IT'S A GOOD THING I'M PREVENTED FROM SETTING MY CAP AT HIM BY HIS HAVING A WIFE AND TEN CHILDREN 
AND HE'S UGLY 
WELL DONE FANNY YOU HAVE AT LAST UNCOVERED THE TRUE REASON WHY I NEVER CHOSE A HUSBAND 
WHY BECAUSE YOU NEVER FOUND ONE HANDSOME ENOUGH NO 
I NEVER FOUND ONE WORTH GIVING UP FLIRTING FOR 
A CASTLE 
NO YES IT'S BEEN IN THE WILDMAN FAMILY FOR CENTURIES 
YES I CAN DEFINITELY SEE YOU AT THE ALTAR WITH MR. WILDMAN 
I LIKE THE IDEA OF YOU IN A CASTLE AND THE NEXT ONE NOW HE LOOKS VERY NICE UNAFFECTED 
HE'S A BIT BORING OH 
THE KNATCHBULLS HAVE POTS OF MONEY THEIR FATHER'S A BARONET 
WELL I LIKE THAT QUIET SENSIBLE LOOK 
HE MIGHT DO YOU FOR YOU VERY WELL 
NOW THAT MUST BE MR. HATTON YOU WROTE TO ME ABOUT THE ONE WITH THE HEAVENLY BODY 
ARE THERE ANY CASTLES IN HIS FAMILY 
NO 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SAW IN HIM NOW 
FANNY KNATCHBULL FANNY HATTON FANNY WILDMAN 
FANNY PLUMPTREE 
I SHALL MARRY HIM IF HE ASKS ME 
I HOPE HE ASKS ME 
BUT I THINK YOU LIKE ANY OF THE OTHERS BETTER THAN HIM 
NONSENSE MR. PLUMPTREE HAS A THOUSAND GOOD QUALITIES 
IF YOU OVERLOOK THE COARSE MOTHER AND THE SISTERS LIKE HORSES 
GOOD PROSPECTS 
GOOD CHARACTER 
HE'S A GOOD MATCH FOR YOU FANNY 
I'M NOT LIKE YOU AUNT JANE 
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD I WANT TO BE MARRIED 
AND I WOULD HAVE YOU MARRY 
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WON'T BE HAPPY UNTIL YOU ARE 
SINGLE WOMEN HAVE A DREADFUL PROPENSITY FOR BEING POOR 
AND THE BEST RECIPE I KNOW FOR HAPPINESS IS A LARGE INCOME 
WHO'S THERE 
SHOW YOURSELF 
FANNY WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE 
MY FAULT I'M AFRAID MR. BRIDGES 
MISS AUSTEN AUNT JANE HAS ACCEPTED THE AWFUL DUTY OF OFFERING ME MORAL GUIDANCE 
IN THE SHRUBBERY AS GOOD A PLACE AS ANY TO LEAD A YOUNG LADY ASTRAY 
FANNY GO TO BED NOW PLEASE 
I WAS INVITED TO STAY HERE AT FANNY'S REQUEST TO HELP HER MAKE A DECISION ABOUT HER MR. PLUMPTREE 
I DIDN'T KNOW HE'D MADE HER AN OFFER HOW DOES A GENTLEMAN'S FAILURE TO MAKE AN OFFER INTERFERE 
WITH A LADY'S ABILITY TO DECIDE WHETHER SHE LIKES HIM OR NOT WHAT LADY FLIRTS SHAMELESSLY ALL NIGHT 
THEN LURKS OUTSIDE IN THE DARK GAWPING AND GOSSIPING 
THANK YOU FOR SO FREELY SHARING YOUR POOR OPINION OF MY CONDUCT AND CHARACTER 
GOODNIGHT MR. BRIDGES 
MY DEAR CASSANDRA 
I BELIEVE I DRANK TOO MUCH WINE LAST NIGHT 
I KNOW NOT ELSE HOW TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SHAKING OF MY HAND TODAY 
MY HAIR WAS AT LEAST TIDY 
WHICH WAS ALL MY AMBITION 
THERE YOU ARE 
EVERYONE ELSE IS OUT TAKING THE MORNING AIR 
I KNOW 
I'M VERY LATE DOWN 
THOUGHT I MIGHT CATCH YOU SITTING IN THE CORNER SOMEWHERE SCRIBBLING 
I'M NOT AT ALL IN THE HUMOUR FOR WRITING 
STILL GOING WELL I HOPE 
WELL EMMA IS NEARLY FINISHED BUT MR. EDGERTON IS REFUSING TO PUBLISH ANOTHER EDITION OF MANSFIELD PARK 
AND I WAS WONDERING 
MAYBE WE SHOULD FIND A NEW PUBLISHER FOR EMMA 
MAYBE WE SHOULD ASK FOR SOME MORE MONEY TOO 
DEAR LORD I DO WISH YOU WOULDN'T THINK OF IT AS WRITING FOR MONEY 
SENSE AND SENSIBILITY HAS BROUGHT ME ONE HUNDRED FORTY MAY I NOT BE PROUD OF THAT 
TRY TO IMAGINE HOW IT REFLECTS ON US YOUR BROTHERS TO HAVE AN UNMARRIED SISTER SEEKING EMPLOYMENT 
JANE I WILL ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF YOU AND CASS AND MOTHER 
BUT I'M A WIDOWER I HAVE ELEVEN CHILDREN 
I INHERITED A HOUSE I CAN'T AFFORD TO RUN AND AN ESTATE RIDDLED WITH LEGAL COMPLICATIONS 
WHAT COMPLICATIONS 
I FACE A CHALLENGE TO MY INHERITANCE 
A DEED WAS DRAWN UP WRONGLY SO THEY SAY 
IF THEY WIN JANE I'LL LOSE HALF OF EVERYTHING I OWN 
NOT THIS HOUSE 
NO NO THIS HOUSE IS QUITE SAFE 
I DIDN'T MAKE MYSELF CLEAR 
THE WRIT ONLY AFFECTS MY CLAIM ON MY HAMPSHIRE PROPERTIES 
THE COTTAGE NOW I DON'T WANT YOU TO WORRY THERE'LL ALWAYS BE A PLACE FOR YOU ALL HERE WITH US 
EDWARD THE COTTAGE IS WHERE I WRITE 
OH JANE 
IF ONLY YOU'D BEEN LESS PROUD 
IF ONLY YOU'D MARRIED 
BUT IF EVERYTHING ON EARTH IS MADE BY GOD 
INCLUDING US AND EVERYTHING WE DO THEN THAT MUST INCLUDE MUSIC 
YES SACRED MUSIC 
DEVOTED TO MAGNIFYING HIS GRACE 
BUT DO YOU THINK HE NEVER MEANT US TO DANCE HE DID GIVE US FEET 
OH NOW YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF ME I'M NOT I KNOW YOU THINK I'M TOO SERIOUS 
I DON'T LIKE YOUR AUNT JANE ALWAYS LAUGHING OUT OF THE SIDE OF HER FACE SHE DOESN'T 
I DON'T EITHER 
PLEASE LET'S NOT ARGUE 
NO WE MUSTN'T ARGUE 
YOU'RE RIGHT 
I'M SORRY 
OH FANNY 
YOU THINK ME SO SERIOUS 
AND HERE I AM 
OVERCOME BY FEELINGS OF JOY 
AND I MUST ASK YOU 
UM 
COULD YOU 
ER THAT IS MAY I. 
COULD YOU CONSIDER 
HOW HARD IT IS TO FIND WORDS TO EXPRESS ONE'S DEEPEST FEELINGS 
UM 
OH YOU'RE LAUGHING 
LOOK I KNOW I'M NOT BRILLIANT WITH WORDS 
OH NO YOU ARE 
YOU ARE 
JOHN 
FORGIVE ME 
I THINK I MIGHT TAKE A WALK TO THAT LINE OF TREES 
BEECHES I THINK 
BEECHES 
YES I BELIEVE SO 
FAGUS SYLVATICA 
THE DEAD LEAVES STAY ON THE TREE ALL OVER THE WINTER DID YOU KNOW THAT 
FASCINATING SUBJECT BOTANY 
OH GOD 
I SHALL DESERVE IT IF YOU NEVER FORGIVE ME FOR MY DREADFUL RUDENESS LAST NIGHT 
YOU ARE FORGIVEN EVERYTHING EXCEPT YOUR FAILURE TO ASK ME TO DANCE 
WHAT AND LET YOU POINT OUT HOW LITTLE MY TECHNIQUE HAS IMPROVED IN ALL THESE YEARS 
YOU WERE ALWAYS ENTHUSIASTIC WHICH IS WHAT ONE NEEDS MOST IN A MAN 
I WAITED FOR NEWS THAT YOU'D MARRIED AS EVERY WOMAN KNOWS THERE'S A SCARCITY OF MEN IN GENERAL 
AND AN EVEN GREATER SCARCITY OF ANY THAT ARE GOOD FOR MUCH 
YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND YOUR CLEVER WORDS AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE GOOD 
BECAUSE MY CLEVER WORDS WILL SOON BE THE ONLY THING PUTTING A ROOF OVER MY HEAD 
OR MY MOTHER'S OR MY SISTER'S 
I'M TO BE MY OWN HUSBAND IT SEEMS 
AND THEIRS 
I'D'VE PUT A ROOF OVER ALL YOUR HEADS AND CHERISHED YOU DEAR JANE TILL DEATH DID US PART 
AUNT JANE AUNT JANE 
AUNT JANE I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU 
MY DARLING GIRL WHEN I CONSIDER HOW FEW YOUNG MEN YOU HAVE YET SEEN MUCH OF 
AND HOW MUCH TEMPTATION THE NEXT SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OF YOUR LIFE WILL BE FULL OF 
I'LL BE TWENTY SEVEN 
A WOMAN OF SEVEN AND TWENTY CAN NEVER HOPE TO FEEL OR INSPIRE AFFECTION AGAIN THAT WAS SATIRE 
JUST BECAUSE YOU WROTE THAT AS A JOKE IT DOESN'T STOP IT BEING TRUE 
HE THINKS WE BOTH LAUGH AT HIM HE'LL NEVER PLUCK UP THE COURAGE AGAIN I'VE MISSED MY ONLY CHANCE 
YOU COULD HAVE MY WIDOWER ALL SIX CHILDREN 
WHY MUST YOU ALWAYS TURN EVERYTHING INTO A JOKE 
THIS IS REAL IT'S ME AND ALL I WANT IS TO BE A GIRL AND BE PRETTY 
AND BE LOVED BY JOHN PLUMPTREE AND MARRY HIM LIKE ANNA MARRIED BEN 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT THE FIRST IDEA WHAT IT'S LIKE 
BEN HAD A COUSIN WHO CAME TO VISIT HAMPSHIRE ONE SUMMER WHEN I WAS TWENTY 
YOUR AGE EXACTLY 
TOM LEFROY WAS GOING TO BE A LAWYER 
JUST LIKE MR. PLUMPTREE 
SHOCKING AMOUNTS OF DANCING WENT ON I REMEMBER 
SHAMELESS BOUTS OF SITTING TOGETHER AND GAZING AT EACH OTHER 
I WAS A HORRIBLE FLIRT 
DOES THIS RING ANY BELLS WHAT HAPPENED 
WISER HEADS THAN MINE NOTICED THAT WE NEITHER OF US HAD ANY MONEY 
SO AT THE END OF THE SUMMER HE WENT HOME 
FORTUNATE FELLOW MARRIED AN HEIRESS 
WAS HE THE ONE 
NO HE WASN'T 
AND I'M TELLING YOU THIS BECAUSE IT HURT ME FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES THEN IT PASSED 
YOU'RE SO YOUNG 
DEPEND UPON IT FANNY THE RIGHT MAN WILL COME ALONG 
HE NEVER DID FOR YOU 
MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS WERE GONE SINCE THIS LITTLE HISTORY 
OF SORROWFUL INTEREST HAD REACHED ITS CLOSE 
SHE HOPED TO BE WISE AND REASONABLE IN TIME BUT ALAS 
SHE MUST CONFESS TO HERSELF THAT SHE WAS NOT WISE YET 
SHE HAD USED HIM ILL 
DESERTED AND DISAPPOINTED HIM AND WORSE SHE HAD SHOWN A FEEBLENESS OF CHARACTER IN DOING SO 
WHICH HIS OWN DECIDED CONFIDENT TEMPER COULD NOT ENDURE 
SHE HAD GIVEN HIM UP TO OBLIGE OTHERS 
SHE HAD BEEN FORCED INTO PRUDENCE IN HER YOUTH 
SHE LEARNED ROMANCE AS SHE GREW OLDER 
THE NATURAL SEQUENCE TO AN UNNATURAL BEGINNING 
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN SIT THERE WITH DRY EYES 
I NEVER WEEP OVER ANYTHING THAT MIGHT MAKE ME SOME MONEY 
YOU COULD CALL IT PERSUASION THE NEW PUBLISHER WOULD BE THRILLED 
MY DARLING BROTHER IS A GENIUS 
SO WHEN'S OUR PUBLICATION DATE 
DON'T REALLY HAVE ONE NOT A DATE AS SUCH 
BUT THE CONTRACT 
THE CONTRACT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS 
OH JANE THE MONEY HE'S OFFERING 
HE WANTS ALL YOUR BOOKS FOR FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY 
THAT'S PITIFUL 
I'M A BANKER IF THERE'S ONE THING BANKERS KNOW ABOUT IT'S MONEY 
YOU KNOW YOU CAN RELY ON ME 
MADEMOISELLE JANE WELCOME TO LONDON MADAME 
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU 
WHAT IF I'M MAD TO THINK ANYONE CAN LOVE A HORRIBLE LITTLE SNOB WHO CAN'T MIND HER OWN BUSINESS 
EMMA EVERYONE'LL LOVE HER 
WHAT IF EVERYONE THINKS IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS PRIDE AND PREJUDICE 
WHAT IF EVERYONE THINKS MY BEST WORK IS BEHIND ME 
HENRY 
DARLING WHAT IS IT 
WHY HASN'T HE SEEN A DOCTOR 
LET HIM REST MADEMOISELLE 
HE'S ALWAYS BETTER BY THE MORNING

I NEED YOUR HELP MY BROTHER'S TERRIBLY ILL 
HE'S SCREAMING WITH PAIN STOMACH PAIN OF SOME SORT 
IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR AGES HE HASN'T SAID A THING 
WE DON'T LIVE FAR AWAY HANS PLACE I WALKED HERE MYSELF 
ALONE I HAD NO CHOICE 
I DON'T NEED A DOCTOR 
AND YOU MUSTN'T GO WANDERING THE TOWN ON YOUR OWN 
YOU'RE FORTUNATE TO HAVE SUCH A DEVOTED SISTER MR. AUSTEN 
WOULD YOU EXCUSE US 
HE'S SO YOUNG I HOPE HE KNOWS WHAT TO DO 
NOT MUCH FUN FOR YOU THIS 
ISN'T THAT WHAT WIDOWED BROTHERS ARE FOR 
SUFFERING TERRIFYING ILLNESSES AND GIVING THEIR UNMARRIED SISTERS A CHANCE TO FUSS AND FLAP 
PICK UP THAT NOTEBOOK 
CERTAINLY NOT 
I'M NOT A WRITER TODAY 
I'M YOUR NURSE YOU JUST WRITE DOWN WHAT I TELL YOU TO WRITE 
GO ON 
SO TO MR. JOHN MURRAY PUBLISHER 
NO HENRY 
WHY DON'T I JUST GO TO SEE MR. MURRAY MYSELF 
YOU CAN'T GO OUT TO A GENTLEMEN PUBLISHER'S OFFICE 
IT'S NOT SEEMLY IT'S NOT RESPECTABLE 
I'D RATHER BE RICH THAN RESPECTABLE 
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE 
GLAD TO SEE YOU LOOKING A LITTLE BRIGHTER TODAY MR. AUSTEN 
AND MISS AUSTEN 
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND LAST NIGHT JUST WHO BROUGHT ME HERE 
I'M DELIGHTED TO INTRODUCE MYSELF TO YOU PROPERLY MISS AUSTEN CHARLES HADEN AN ADMIRER 
I'M SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT YOU READ NOVELS 
I'M NOT CLEVER ENOUGH FOR YOU 
GENTLEMEN READ BETTER BOOKS 
I'VE READ FAR MORE SENTIMENTAL NOVELS THAN IS GOOD FOR MY IMMORTAL SOUL 
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT WORD SENTIMENTAL BACK 
IF YOU WANT TO TRULY PROVE YOU'VE READ MINE 
I WAS PARTICULARLY ENTERTAINED TO NOTICE THAT LIZZIE BENNET 
ONLY REALISES SHE LOVES MR. DARCY WHEN SHE SEES HOW BIG HIS HOUSE IS 
THE MOMENT FOR ALARM HAS PAST BEDREST AND QUIET ARE WHAT HE NEEDS THIS MEANS YOU 
I'VE TAKEN TWENTY OUNCES OF BLOOD 
BUT I FEAR I SHALL HAVE TO COME TOMORROW TO DO THE SAME OH GOOD 
I MEAN ER JUST AS YOU SAY 
WELL GOOD DAY MISS AUSTEN LADIES 
SEE YOU TOMORROW THEN IT'LL BE MY PLEASURE 
YOU MUST FANCY HENRY IN THE BACK ROOM UPSTAIRS 
AND I AM GENERALLY THERE ALSO WORKING OR WRITING 
HENRY CALLS HIMSELF STRONGER EVERY DAY 
AND MR. HADEN KEEPS APPROVING HIS PULSE 
A YOUNG MAN SAID TO BE CLEVER AND HE IS CERTAINLY VERY ATTENTIVE 
TOMORROW HE IS TO DINE WITH US 
THERE'S HAPPINESS 
I'VE REALLY GROWN SO FOND OF MR. HADEN THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT 
FROM JANE 
NO 
MR. H. IS READING MANSFIELD PARK FOR THE FIRST TIME AND PREFERS IT TO PRIDE AND PREJUDICE 
BUT CASSANDRA YOU SEEM TO BE UNDER A MISTAKE AS TO MR. H. 
YOU CALL HIM AN APOTHECARY 
HE IS NO APOTHECARY 
HE NEVER HAS BEEN AN APOTHECARY 
HE IS A HADEN 
NOTHING BUT A HADEN 
A SORT OF WONDERFUL NON DESCRIPT CREATURE ON TWO LEGS 
SOMETHING BETWEEN A MAN AND AN ANGEL 
INFINITIES OF LOVE 
J. AUSTEN 
JANE GOD LIKE FIGURES QUIVER AT THE SIGHT OF HIS SCALPEL 
JANE 
OH SHE'S IN HER OWN LITTLE WORLD 
MADEMOISELLE HADEN HERE'S GOT A JOLLY GOOD IDEA FOR YOU 
MIGHT EVEN FORCE A BETTER OFFER OUT OF OUR PUBLISHERS 
TALK TO HER HADEN PERHAPS YOUR BROTHER HAS NOT TOLD YOU MISS AUSTEN 
BUT MY SENIOR PARTNER HAS PATIENTS IN ASTONISHINGLY HIGH PLACES 
PLACES QUITE BEYOND IMAGING 
BUT MY IMAGINATION FLIES VERY HIGH 
WELL I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT THE PRINCE REGENT LOVES YOUR BOOKS 
OH I HATE THAT MAN 
I ALWAYS TAKE HIS WIFE'S SIDE 
HIDE YOUR TRUE FEELINGS AS YOU WILL 
I'M TOLD TO EXPECT A ROYAL INVITATION AT ANY MOMENT 
WE ARE TO ATTEND HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS 
NOT WE NO YOU JUST YOU 
I'M ONLY THE MESSENGER 
WELL I SHALL DECLINE IT 
THE PRINCE REGENT IS SUCH A DISAGREEABLE MAN 
IT'S QUITE A MISFORTUNE TO BE LIKED BY HIM 
OH SO YOU WISH ONLY TO BE READ BY MEN YOU APPROVE OF 
WHY SHOULDN'T I CHOOSE MY READERS AS I CHOOSE MY FRIENDS 
BECAUSE YOU'LL NEVER MAKE YOUR FORTUNE 
THEN I SHALL REMAIN POOR AND OBSCURE FOREVER 
NO ON THE CONTRARY 
I WOULD GIVE A LOT TO SEE YOU IN A FINE GOWN SPARKLING IN THE BEST COMPANY 
AND HOW DOES MR. PLUMPTREE LIKE YOUR COMING TO LONDON WITHOUT HIM 
OF COURSE HE'S COMPLETELY DEVOTED NOW 
HANGS OFF MY EVERY WORD 
WHENEVER I LOOK AT HIM HE'S GAZING DOWN ADORINGLY 
AUNT JANE I DON'T KNOW IF I DO LOVE HIM AFTER ALL 
WHAT STRANGE CREATURES WE ARE 
SOON AS WE ARE SURE OF A MAN'S ATTACHMENT WE BECOME INDIFFERENT 
POOR MR. PLUMPTREE 
YOU MUST GIVE HIM UP NO 
WHENEVER YOU ARE TOGETHER BEHAVE WITH A COLDNESS 
THAT MAY CONVINCE HIM THAT HE HAS BEEN DECEIVING HIMSELF BUT HE'LL BE SO HURT 
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE WILL SUFFER A GREAT DEAL FOR A TIME 
BUT IT IS NO CREED OF MINE THAT SUCH SORT OF DISAPPOINTMENTS KILL ANYBODY 
NOW THAT I'VE ARRIVED IN LONDON 
WHERE THE STREETS ARE PAVED WITH EAGER YOUNG GENTLEMEN 
FANNY 
NOTHING COMPARES WITH THE MISERY OF BEING BOUND WITHOUT LOVE 
BOUND TO ONE AND 
PREFERRING ANOTHER 
THAT IS A PUNISHMENT EVEN YOU DO NOT DESERVE 
YOU'VE GOT A LOVELY CURL IN YOUR HAIR TODAY 
NOT NERVES SURELY 
MR. HADEN 
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS 
I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE 
YOU HAVE SOMETHING MUCH MORE POWERFUL AND MUCH MORE DESIRABLE THAN EXPERIENCE 
GO ON 
YOU HAVE IMAGINATION 
THINK OF ME CHEERING YOU ON YOUR GREATEST SUPPORTER WILLING YOU TO VICTORY 
MISS AUSTEN 
MISS AUSTEN THE HONOUR OF YOUR VISIT IS IMMENSE 
IT'S JUST INCALCULABLE 
NOW THE REGENT HAS READ AND ADMIRED ALL THE PUBLICATIONS 
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS KEEPS COPIES IN EVERY ONE OF HIS RESIDENCIES 
YES INDEED HE DOES AND EVEN I HIS HUMBLE LIBRARIAN JAMES STANLEY CLARK 
I HAVE READ THEM ALL 
TWICE 
WILL YOU HAVE CAKE 
I WILL 
I'M SURE EMMA WILL BE A TRIUMPH I'M AFRAID THOSE READERS WHO LIKED PRIDE AND PREJUDICE 
WILL THINK IT TOO SERIOUS AND THOSE WHO LIKED MANSFIELD PARK WILL THINK IT NOT SERIOUS ENOUGH 
IMPOSSIBLE SINCE WITH EVERY NEW WORK YOUR MIND SEEMS TO INCREASE IT'S ENERGY 
YOUR BOOKS REFLECT THE HIGHEST HONOUR ON YOUR GENIUS AND YOUR PRINCIPLES 
THEY ARE MY DARLING CHILDREN 
I SEND THEM OUT INTO THE WORLD TO COMPETE 
WITH THE LIKES OF SIR WALTER SCOTT AND LORD BYRON 
NO COMPETITION AT ALL THE GENTLEMEN ARE UNREADABLE 
AND YET I HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SO LITTLE IN MY LIFE 
I HAVE SEEN SO LITTLE 
MY WORK IS SO SMALL MY CANVAS 
MISS AUSTEN JUST A LITTLE BIT OF IVORY 
TWO INCHES WIDE IN WHICH I WORK WITH SO FINE A BRUSH 
YOU ARE QUITE AT LIBERTY TO DEDICATE EMMA 
TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS 
QUITE AT LIBERTY 
ERM PERHAPS IN SOME FUTURE WORK 
YOU COULD WRITE ABOUT THE HABITS OF LIFE CHARACTERS AND ENTHUSIASM 
OF A CLERGYMAN DESCRIBE HIM BURYING HIS OWN MOTHER 
AS I DID NEVER RECOVERED FROM THE SHOCK OR OR 
CARRY YOUR CLERGYMAN TO SEA AS THE FRIEND OF SOME DISTINGUISHED NAVAL CHARACTER 
I AM HONOURED BUT A MAN SUCH AS THAT WOULD HAVE TO TALK ON SUBJECTS 
SUCH AS SCIENCE PHILOSOPHY OF WHICH A WOMAN LIKE ME CAN KNOW NOTHING 
ALAS I THINK I MAY BOAST MYSELF TO BE WITH ALL POSSIBLE VANITY 
MOST UNLEARNED AND UNINFORMED FEMALE WHO EVER DARED TO CALL HERSELF AN AUTHORESS 
WELL DONE SO NAUGHTY YOU SHOULD TAKE PITY ON THE POOR KIND SOUL 
I NEVER TAKE PITY ON ANYONE TO WHOM I'M NOT RELATED ANOTHER REASON 
TO THANK THE LORD EACH DAY THAT I'M YOUR BROTHER TO OUR WICKED JANE AND TO EMMA 
LIKE HER CREATOR YOUR EMMA IS A JEWEL TO JANE AND EMMA 
AND NOW THAT YOU HAVE CONTRIVED TO GET IT DEDICATED BY PERMISSION TO NONE OTHER THAN THE PRINCE REGENT 
NO YOU CONTRIVED IT FOR WHICH I THANK YOU MOST GRATEFULLY MR. JOHN MURRAY PUBLISHER 
OF THIS PARISH WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GIVE IT A SWIFT PRINT RUN I SHALL GET TWO ZERO COPIES OUT OF HIM 
AT TWENTY ONE SHILLINGS FOR THE THREE VOLUMES 
SURELY YOU CAN GET MORE AS ANY PUBLISHER WILL TELL YOU PUBLIC TASTE TENDS MORE TO SERIOUS ROMANCE 
I COULDN'T WRITE ONE OF THOSE TO SAVE MY LIFE I PREFER TO LET OTHER PENS DWELL ON GUILT AND MISERY 
A TOAST TO GUILT AND MISERY GUILT AND MISERY 
NOW IF WE ARE TO HELP YOU MAKE YOUR FORTUNE MISS AUSTEN WE MUST HELP YOU TO WRITE A PROPER MODERN NOVEL 
THE KIND WHERE EVERY HEROINE MUST BE THE DAUGHTER OF A CLERGYMAN PERFECTLY GOOD TENDER SENTIMENTAL 
HAVE NOT THE TINIEST SENSE OF HUMOUR SPEAK SEVERAL FOREIGN LANGUAGES BRILLIANTLY 
AND BE WONDERFUL AT MUSIC OBVIOUSLY AND WHICH INSTRUMENT SHALL OUR NEW HEROINE PLAY 
THE PIANO THE PIANO BECAUSE IT SHOWS OFF HER ARMS SO BEAUTIFULLY 
WHAT HERO WOULD BE WORTHY OF SUCH A PARAGON ONE WHO IS PERFECTLY BORING 
AND BORINGLY PERFECT TO CONTEMPLATE YOU'LL HAVE TO WRITE HIS CHAPTERS MR. HADEN 
PICTURES OF PERFECTION MAKE ME SICK AND WICKED 
YES VILLAINS ARE SO MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE TOTALLY UNPRINCIPLED AND HEARTLESS 
DESPERATELY IN LOVE WITH THE HEROINE HE PURSUES HER WITH A RELENTLESS PASSION 
OUR HEROINE IS UTTERLY BEAUTIFUL AND HER ELDERLY FATHER 
UTTERLY HOPELESS OH DEAR PLEASE DON'T TELL MY BROTHER 
EVERYWHERE OUR HEROINE GOES PEOPLE FALL IN LOVE WITH HER AND SHE RECEIVES REPEATED OFFERS OF MARRIAGE 
THEN AFTER AT LEAST TWENTY NARROW ESCAPES OF FALLING INTO THE ARMS 
OF ANTI HERO MANY TEARS FLOW AND IN THE NICK OF TIME 
SHE MARRIES THE ONE SHE IS DESTINED FOR ALL ALONG 
AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT MISS AUSTEN HOW DESTINY ALWAYS PROVIDES US WITH A PERFECT MATE 
I DO WHEN I'M WRITING A NOVEL 
SO UNROMANTIC OH BUT YOUR AUNT'S HEROINES ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT 
EACH ONE MARRIES A WEALTHY MAN EACH ONE SHE MARRIES FOR LOVE 
AND YOU MONSIEUR HADEN WHAT IS YOU IDEA OF THE PERFECT WIFE 
STRONG MIND AND SWEETNESS OF MANNER WELL SAID HADEN IN THIS COMPANY 
COULD YOU PLAY THIS FOR ME 
SHE'LL HAVE YOU A SWEET WIFE ALL GRATITUDE AND DEVOTION 
I WOULD WISH HER TO BE OF A SILENT TURN AND SOMEWHAT IGNORANT 
FOND OF COLD VEAL PIES AND GREEN TEA IN THE AFTERNOON 
YOU LOOKED FAGGED HENRY I'LL TAKE YOU UPSTAIRS 
NO FEAR I'M ENJOYING MYSELF FAR TOO MUCH 
IMAGINE IF YOU COULD TAKE MR. PLUMPTREE'S MODESTY 
MR. WILDMAN'S CASTLE IN KENT AND MR. HADEN'S 
NOT SURE I KNOW THE WORDS FOR WHAT MR. HADEN CONTRIBUTES GOOD LORD 
WHAT HAS BECOME OF ALL THE SHYNESS IN THE WORLD 
CAN ALL THE YOUNG MEN IN LONDON BE AS FLIRTATIOUS AS MR. HADEN 
WAS THAT TWO CHAIRS I SAW YOU AND HIM SITTING IN OR JUST THE ONE 
AUNT JANE YOU'RE JEALOUS I AM AN AUNT STILL A WOMAN 
STILL A CAT WHEN I SEE A MOUSE 
WELL YOU CAN HAVE HIM MY DEAR I WILL NOT STAND IN THE WAY OF YOUR HAPPINESS 
AUNT JANE AUNT JANE 
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT YOUR MR. PLUMPTREE THE WARMER MY FEELINGS BECOME 
THE MORE STRONGLY I FEEL THE DESIRABLENESS OF YOUR FALLING IN LOVE WITH HIM AGAIN 
YOU LIKE MR. HADEN DON'T YOU HE HAS VERY GOOD TEETH 
IF WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER 
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE WANTED TO BECOME A DOCTOR'S WIFE 
THERE'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH MONEY IN MEDICINE 
DID I TELL YOU MADEMOISELLE 
I HAD A LETTER FROM MY FRIEND LIVING IN PARIS 
SHE HAS READ A WONDERFUL BOOK IT IS CALLED RAISON ET SENSIBILITE 
SENSE AND SENSIBILITY 
MY FRIEND SAYS WHOEVER THE WOMAN IS 
WHO WROTE THIS BOOK SHE KNOWS MORE ABOUT LOVE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD 
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE WHO CAN'T COOK WRITING A RECIPE BOOK 
PASSION IS MEANT FOR THE YOUNG 
IT FADES SO QUICKLY NOT IN OUR DREAMS 
COMFORT REMAINS FRIENDSHIP REMAINS 
IF YOU ARE LUCKY AS I WAS 
HAPPINESS IN MARRIAGE IS ENTIRELY A MATTER OF CHANCE 
BUT THE FUSS WE MAKE OF WHO TO CHOOSE 
AND LOVE STILL DIES AND MONEY STILL VANISHES 
AND EVERY WOMAN SPINSTER WIFE EVERY WOMAN HAS REGRETS 
SO WE READ ABOUT YOUR HEROINES 
AND FEEL YOUNG AGAIN 
AND IN LOVE AND FULL OF HOPE AS IF WE CAN MAKE THAT CHOICE AGAIN 
DO IT RIGHT THIS TIME 
THIS IS THE GIFT WHICH GOD HAS GIVEN YOU 
IT IS ENOUGH I THINK 
FOR A FEW MOMENTS HER IMAGINATION AND HER HEART WERE BEWITCHED 
SHE HAD SOME FEELINGS WHICH SHE WAS ASHAMED TO INVESTIGATE 
THEY WERE TOO MUCH LIKE JOY SENSELESS JOY ANNE HOPED 
SHE HAD OUTLIVED THE AGE OF BLUSHING THE AGE OF EMOTION 
SHE CERTAINLY HAD NOT ALL THE OVERPOWERING BLINDING BEWILDERING 
FIRST EFFECTS OF STRONG SURPRISE WERE OVER WITH HER 
STILL HOWEVER SHE HAD ENOUGH TO FEEL 
IT WAS AGITATION PAIN PLEASURE 
SOMETHING BETWEEN DELIGHT AND MISERY 
THE ROOM SEEMED FULL OF PERSONS AND VOICES 
A THOUSAND FEELINGS RUSHED ON ANNE OF WHICH THIS WAS THE MOST CONSOLING 
BUT IT WOULD SOON BE OVER 
JANE READY 
WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE 
COMING 
SLOWCOACH 
SANCTIFY THIS WATER TO THE MYSTICAL WASHING AWAY OF SIN 
AND GRANT THAT THIS CHILD NOW TO BE BAPTISED THEREIN 
MAY RECEIVE THE FULLNESS OF HIS GRACE AND EVER REMAIN IN THE NUMBER 
OF HIS FAITHFUL AND ELECT CHILDREN THROUGH JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD AMEN 
LET'S GO STRAIGHT HOME 
IT'S JUST A BIT OF BACKACHE REALLY I'M WELL 
DON'T MAKE A FUSS 
POOR ANIMAL SHE'LL BE WORN OUT BEFORE SHE'S THIRTY 
GIRLS WELL FANNY NOW YOU ARE ALMOST AN AUNT 
YOU ARE A PERSON OF SOME CONSEQUENCE 
YOU MUST EXCITE GREAT INTEREST WHATEVER YOU DO 
MY DEAR WHAT IS IT 
MR. PLUMPTREE'S GOT ENGAGED TO SOMEBODY ELSE 
YOU COULD AT LEAST TRY AND BE UPSET FOR ME 
MY DEAR SWEET PERVERSE FANNY 
YOU DID NOT CHOOSE TO HAVE HIM FOR YOURSELF 
WHY NOT ALLOW HIM TO TAKE COMFORT WHERE HE CAN 
I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN HIM BUT YOU RUINED IT 
I DID NOT YOU LAUGHED AT HIM 
AND EVERY TIME I LOOKED AT HIM I SAW HIM THROUGH YOUR EYES 
YOU FRIGHTEN ME OUT OF MY WITS 
YOU CANNOT LET ANYTHING DEPEND ON THE OPINION OF YOUR MAIDEN AUNT 
OH DON'T WORRY I KNOW THAT NOW 
AT YOUR TIME OF LIFE MAKING A SPECTACLE OF YOURSELF WITH THAT SILLY BUTTERFLY OF A DOCTOR 
GIRLS IN FRONT OF EVERYONE 
GIRLS HOW COULD I EVER HAVE THOUGHT 
YOU KNEW THE FIRST THING ABOUT REAL LIFE 
GIRLS COME THIS INSTANT AND ADMIRE THIS BEAUTIFUL LITTLE CREATURE 
ISN'T SHE LOVELY SHE HAS THE AUSTEN EYES I THINK 
HAVEN'T YOU LITTLE BEAUTY YES THAT'S RIGHT 
AUNT JANE I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET MY JEMIMA

LOOK AT THE DEAR GIRL 
CLEVER AS THE DAY IS LONG BUT GIVE HER A BABY AND SHE HAS NO IDEA WHICH END IS UP 
HARDLY LIKE A WOMAN AT ALL 
SHE DOESN'T MEAN TO BE CRUEL 
I KNOW YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE HAPPY AND SHE TAKES YOU AT YOUR WORD 
I AM HAPPY CASS SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU IN LONDON 
SOMETHING BETWEEN A MAN AND AN ANGEL 
MR. HADEN WAS YOUNG UNSUITABLE AND HE THOUGHT HIMSELF VERY CLEVER AND VERY FINE 
AND YOU THOUGHT HIM I DIDN'T THINK HIM ANYTHING AT ALL 
THINKING DIDN'T COME INTO IT 
MY MIND WAS NOT INVOLVED 
YOU TAKE ME BACK TO FEELINGS I THOUGHT WERE LONG FORGOTTEN 
FEELINGS BEST LEFT BURIED FOR TWO OLD LADIES LIKE US 
YOU COULD HAVE NO I COULDN'T 
YES YOU COULD NO I'M HAPPY TOO JANE 
STUCK HERE LOOKING AFTER MOTHER AND ME 
WELL SOMEONE HAS TO DO IT 
HENRY SSH DON'T WAKE MOTHER 
WE WEREN'T EXPECTING YOU TILL TOMORROW 
IT MEANS I'VE LENT TOO MUCH AND I'VE BORROWED TOO MUCH AND NOW 
OH GOD JANE DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT 
YES MY BANK HAS COLLAPSED 
WHICH MEANS YES I'M RUINED 
BANKRUPT EDWARD COULD HELP YOU 
EDWARD HAS HIS LAWSUIT 
HE HAS ENOUGH PROBLEMS OF HIS OWN 
EDWARD'S ALREADY GUARANTEED MY LOANS UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND 
I DON'T THINK HE'LL EVER SEE THAT MONEY AGAIN 
OH HENRY 
OH GOD NOW DO YOU SEE 
I'LL TAKE THE WHOLE FAMILY DOWN WITH ME MOTHER 
DON'T SAY A WORD 
I'LL TELL HER MYSELF 
I'LL TELL HER TOMORROW 
WHEEE 
WHERE'S SHE GOING NOW OH LEAVE HER BE 
DO YOU WANT TO GO BACK 
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING 
I WANT TO MAKE MORE MONEY 
I WANT YOU AND MOTHER TO BE COMFORTABLE 
AND NOT ALWAYS TERRIFIED THAT OUR BROTHERS ARE GOING TO LOSE THE HOUSE AND EVERYTHING WE HAVE 
I WANT TO SHAKE OFF THIS AWFUL TIREDNESS AND I CAN'T 
WE COULD TAKE YOU TO THE SEASIDE 
NOBODY LOSES THEIR APPETITE AT THE SEASIDE 
NOBODY FEELS GLOOMY AT THE SEASIDE 
NOBODY SUDDENLY FEELS SO WEAK THEY CAN'T STAND 
PLEASE TELL ME WHY YOU'RE ANGRY WITH ME 
WHY SHOULD I BE ANGRY WITH YOU 
I'M ANGRY WITH MYSELF 
I CAN'T BE ILL 
I HAVE A BOOK TO FINISH 
I HAVE SO MANY CHARACTERS IN MY HEAD SO MANY STORIES 
AND SO LITTLE TIME 
JANE LET ME JUST LEAVE ME ALONE 
AH AH I'VE SAVED THAT BIT FOR HENRY 
OH PLEASE TAKE IT MR. PAPILLON I'M QUITE FULL 
WHERE'S YOUR APPETITE TODAY 
I WONDER HOW MANY MORE SHE'LL HAVE 
LET'S HOPE NOT AS MANY AS YOUR POOR MOTHER 
IT'S NOT LIKE IN THE STORY BOOKS FANNY 
BOOKS ALWAYS END WITH WEDDINGS LEAVE FANNY ALONE MOTHER YOU'LL SPOIL THE HAPPY ENDING 
ALL THE INTERESTING BUSINESS HAPPENS AFTER THAT 
MRS. AUSTEN 
LIKE FINDING OUT THAT HOWEVER MUCH YOU LOVE THE MAN YOU MARRIED 
YOU LOVE YOUR CHILDREN MORE 
RIGHT UNCLE HENRY SAVES THE DAY 
HENRY 
ON YOUR WAY BACK TO RAMSGATE AGAIN MR. BRIDGES 
I FEAR THERE IS NO ESCAPING RAMSGATE 
OH 
OH CASSANDRA HAS CAUGHT YOU VERY WELL 
I BELIEVE SHE HAS 
SICKNESS IS A DANGEROUS INDULGENCE AT MY TIME OF LIFE 
WHEN WE MET IN KENT I BELIEVE I SPOKE VERY RASHLY 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE SO UNGALLANT AS TO TAKE IT BACK NOW 
I WOULDN'T HAVE PREVENTED YOU FROM WRITING IF THAT WAS YOUR FEAR 
HOW COULD I HAVE WRITTEN IF WE'D BEEN MARRIED 
ALL THE EFFORT OF MOTHERING 
WE'D HAVE BEEN TOO POOR 
YOU'RE POOR ANYWAY 
WE'D HAVE MADE EACH OTHER LAUGH 
IS THAT WHAT MARRIAGE IS 
I SUPPOSE NO MAN OF FLESH AND BLOOD WOULD EVER BE WORTHY OF THE CREATOR OF MR. DARCY 
YOU'RE ALL QUITE WRONG ABOUT HIM 
HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE FOR ME AT ALL 
IF I HAD PLUCKED UP THE COURAGE AFTER WE DANCED AT THE BALL 
WE'D HAVE BEEN TOO YOUNG 
AND LATER WHEN I DID ASK YOU 
I SIMPLY WENT OFF THE WHOLE IDEA OF MARRYING ANYBODY 
TELL ME NOW YOU REGRET IT 
TELL ME NOW THAT SOMETIMES IN THE NIGHT YOU THINK OF ME 
TELL ME EVEN IF IT ISN'T TRUE 
WHAT ON EARTH WOULD BE THE POINT 
HENRY HAS MADE A COMPLETE HASH OF TELLING MOTHER 
SHE'S TALKING VERY WILDLY OLD GRUDGES RESURFACING 
WHATEVER SHE SAYS JANE DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY 
SHE'S NOT ANGRY WITH ME AT ALL 
I'VE HAD IT WITH BANKING JANE I'M GOING TO BECOME A VICAR 
MY SONS HAVE ALWAYS DONE THEIR BEST FOR THIS FAMILY 
BUT SHE IS A SELFISH SELFISH GIRL 
I SAW YOU WITH MR. BRIDGES FLIRTING LIKE A SILLY GIRL 
HE'S A MARRIED MAN 
IF YOU WANTED TO BE MRS. BRIDGES THE VICAR'S WIFE 
YOU SHOULD'VE SAID YES WHEN HE ASKED YOU THAT'S EASY 
I DIDN'T WANT TO 
IT'S NOT AS IF YOU WERE WAITING FOR THE RICH MAN WITH THE BIG HOUSE 
NO YOU'VE HAD THAT AND THROWN IT AWAY 
YOU THREW YOUR LIFE AWAY AND MINE AND YOUR SISTER'S WITH IT 
BECAUSE NO HE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR CLEVER MISS JANE WITH HER FANCY IDEAS 
NO SHE WAS WORTH MUCH MORE THAN MR. HARRIS BIGG WITH HIS STATELY HOME AND HIS THOUSAND ACRES 
OH MOTHER IT WAS YEARS AGO 
YES FIFTEEN YEARS IT'S ENGRAVED ON MY HEART 
FIFTEEN YEARS SINCE THE NIGHT YOU LET HER RUN AWAY LIKE A SPOILT CHILD FROM MARRIAGE AND SECURITY 
I COULDN'T MARRY A MAN I DIDN'T LOVE 
THEN WHY DID YOU SAY YES TO HIM 
YES HARRIS I WILL BE MRS. BIGG 
I MADE A MISTAKE 
YOUR MISTAKE WAS TO GET UP THE NEXT MORNING AND TAKE YOUR PROMISE BACK 
WHAT DID YOU WANT ME TO DO SELL MYSELF FOR MONEY 
WE WOULD'VE BEEN RICH 
YES 
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
RICH IS JUST ANOTHER WORD FOR SAFE 
OH MOTHER I BEG YOU DON'T YOU PROTECT HER YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH OF THAT 
YOU SACRIFICED ALL OUR SECURITY ON A PRINCIPLE JANE 
AND HAS IT MADE YOU HAPPY 
HAS IT 
LOOK AT YOU 
YOU'RE ILL 
NOBODY TELLS ME ANYTHING BUT I HAVE EYES IN MY HEAD 
OH MY POOR LONELY GIRL 
AUNT JANE NOT NOW FANNY 
YOU SAID YES BECAUSE HE WAS RICH AND NO BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T LOVE HIM 
THAT'S SO ROMANTIC 
WOULD YOU CHOOSE MY LIFE 
YOU CAN BE ANGRY WITH ME FANNY 
BUT DON'T YOU DARE FEEL SORRY FOR ME 
HARRIS BIGG BROOK BRIDGES TOM LEFROY 
ALL ANY ONE OF THOSE MEN MIGHT HAVE DONE IS MAKE ME QUITE HAPPY 
QUITE HAPPY IS NOT ENOUGH 
QUITE HAPPY IS NOT THE ENDING I WANT TO WRITE FOR MY STORY 
AND QUITE POOR IS THE ABSOLUTE LIMIT 
NO THE ONLY REGRET I HAVE ABOUT NOT MARRYING HARRIS BIGG 
IS THAT I'M GOING TO DIE 
AND I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU AND MOTHER WITH NOTHING 
OH DON'T DON'T DON'T JANE 
IT'S MY FAULT 
IF I HAD STAYED SILENT IF I HADN'T PERSUADED YOU 
ALL THAT NIGHT I NAGGED AND NAGGED YOU TO CHANGE YOUR MIND 
I MADE YOU REFUSE HIM 
YOU MADE ME SEE THE CHOICE FOR WHAT IT WAS 
BECAUSE OF ME YOU CHOSE LONELINESS AND POVERTY 
BECAUSE OF YOU 
I CHOSE FREEDOM 
I DIDN'T DO IT FOR YOU JANE 
I KNOW 
I'M SO ASHAMED 
EVERYTHING I HAVE 
AND EVERYTHING I HAVE ACHIEVED 
I OWE TO YOU 
TO THE LIFE WE HAVE MADE HERE 
TO THE LOVE THAT WE HAVE TOGETHER 
THIS LIFE I HAVE 
IS WHAT I NEEDED 
IT'S WHAT GOD INTENDED FOR ME 
I'M SO MUCH HAPPIER THAN I THOUGHT I'D BE 
SO MUCH HAPPIER THAN I DESERVE TO BE 
I AM SO THIRSTY 
YOUR MOTHER SENT ME OH THANK YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE AUNT JANE 
NOT NOW PLEASE THERE'S SO MUCH I NEED TO ASK HER MAYBE TOMORROW 
FANNY 
I'M STILL GOING TO MARRY MR. PAPILLON 
SO YOU'RE WELCOME TO THE HORRID OLD WIDOWER AND HIS SIX CHILDREN 
A WIDOWER WITH SIX CHILDREN 
JANE WAS RIGHT AS USUAL 
ANNOYING GIRL 
DEARLY BELOVED WE ARE GATHERED TOGETHER HERE 
IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND IN THE FACE OF THIS CONGREGATION 
TO JOIN THIS MAN AND THIS WOMAN TOGETHER 
DON'T BE SAD AUNT CASS 
NOT TONIGHT 
I'M MORE THAN HAPPY FOR YOU FANNY 
MY HUSBAND SAYS I'M THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD IN WHOSE SOCIETY HE CAN FIND HAPPINESS 
I'M GLAD HE KNOWS HOW LUCKY HE IS 
WHAT'S THAT YOU'RE DOING 
DON'T WORRY 
I SAVED YOU THE ONES WHERE SHE MENTIONS YOU DON'T 
YOU CAN'T BURN AUNT JANE'S LETTERS 
YOU STILL BELIEVE THERE'S A SECRET LOVE STORY TO UNCOVER 
MAYBE I STILL HOPE THERE IS 
SHE WAS THE SUN OF MY LIFE 
THE GILDER OF EVERY PLEASURE 
THE SOOTHER OF EVERY SORROW 
I HAD NOT A THOUGHT CONCEALED FROM HER 
AND IT'S AS IF I LOST A PART OF MYSELF 
MY HUSBAND SENT ME TO ASK YOU FOR A DANCE 
YOUR AUNT JANE WAS THE DANCER IN THIS FAMILY 
WHEN I LOOK OUT ON SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS 
I FEEL AS IF THERE COULD BE NEITHER WICKEDNESS NOR SORROW IN THE WORLD 
YOU ARE THE DELIGHT OF MY LIFE 
FANNY LISTEN TO YOUR OWN HEART NOW
