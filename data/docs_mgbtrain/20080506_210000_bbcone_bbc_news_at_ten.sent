ASIA'S WORST STORM 
UP TO ONE MILLION 
INSIDE BURMA 
THE FLIGHT 
SITES LIKE 
FLOOD RISK HUNDREDS OF SITES LIKE THIS 
BEING USED 
TO TRY TO CLEAN UP THE IMAGE OF 
ATHLETICS ATHLETICS ON B. B. C. LONDON A NEW ERA AT CITY 
HALL AS BORIS JOHNSON UNVEILS THE 
KEY PEOPLE TO HELP HIM RUN THE 
CAPITAL CAPITAL AND THE ARMED 
GOOD EVENING AN INTERNATIONAL 
EFFORT TO HELP THE CYCLONE VICTIMS 
OF BURMA IS STARTING TO TAKE EFFECT 
IT IS NOW THOUGHT MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND 
PEOPLE HAVE DIED SINCE THE WEEKEND 
MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE MISSING 
AID WORKERS SAY SURVIVORS ARE 
DESPERATELY SEARCHING FOR FOOD AND 
SHELTER THE FORCE OF THE CYCLONE 
CAN BE SEEN IN THE SATELLITE IMAGES 
RELEASED BY NASA AS THE STORM GREW 
IN STRENGTH AS IT HIT BURMA IT 
TRIGGERED A GIANT WAVE WHICH 
FLOODED THE IRRAWADDY DELTA WHERE 
IT IS FEARED MANY THOUSANDS HAVE 
DIED IT SWEPT ON TO THE BIGGEST 
CITY RANGOON WHERE THE MILITARY 
REGIME IS TRYING TO STOP REPORTING 
BY FOREIGN JOURNALISTS A B. B. C. 
REPORTER HAS MADE IT TO RANGOON 
FOR HIS OWN SAFETY WE CAN'T GIVE 
YOU HIS NAME BUT HE HAS SENT THIS 
REPORT REPORT ONLY FROM THE AIR HIGH ABOVE THE 
VAST FLOOD PLAINS OF THE IRRAWADDY 
DELTA CAN WE SEE THE TRUE SCALE OF 
THIS DISASTER IT'S NOW KNOWN THAT 
WHEN THE CYCLONE STRUCK A VAST 
TIDAL SURGE SWEPT INLAND WIPING 
OUT TOWNS AND VILLAGES ACROSS A 
VAST AREA TENS OF THOUSANDS HAVE 
DIED EVEN MORE ARE STILL MISSING 
AS RESCUE TEAMS GET TO AREAS 
PRESENTLY CUT OFF THOSE FIGURES 
ARE LIKELY TO RISE OF THOSE WHO 
SURVIVED ALMOST ONE MILLION PEOPLE 
ARE THOUGHT TO BE WITHOUT FOOD OR 
SHELTER ALL THIS IN A REGION ONCE 
CALLED UP THE RICE BASKET OF BURMA 
AS FOR THE NUMBERS INJURED IT'S 
STILL TOO EARLY TO OFFER RELIABLE 
ESTIMATES BUT THE FIRST SURVIVORS 
HAVE BEEN AIRLIFTED TO HOSPITAL 
COUNTLESS THOUSANDS ARE LEFT BEHIND 
THE SURVIVORS ARE SPENDING A FOURTH 
DAY IN THE OPEN THESE PEOPLE ARE 
HAVING TO DRY POSITIONS ON A 
RAILWAY TRACK POSSESSIONS MUCH 
OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE LIES IN RUINS 
HARBOURS WERE DESTROYED ROADS AND 
BRIDGES WERE SMASHED 
THE LOGISTICS 
ARE QUITE MIND BOGGLING THERE IS 
GOING TO BE A NEED FOR A 
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TRUCKS AND 
BOATS MANY OF THE BIRDS WE NEED 
WILL BE HAVE BEEN DESTROYED 
MANY OF THE BOATS WE ARE LOOKING 
AT THE SCALE OF THE TSUNAMI THIS THIS FOOTAGE SHOWS WHEN A CYCLONE STRUCK 
RANGOON BATTERING THE MOST FAMOUS 
PAGODA AND THE ROYAL LAKE WE SAW 
THE EVIDENCE OF MASSIVE DESTRUCTION 
ALL ROUND HOUSES HAVE BEEN TORN 
DOWN TREES HAVE BEEN RIPPED FROM 
THEIR ROOTS AND THE STREETS ARE 
FILLED WITH EVIDENCE OF THE STORM'S 
TERRIBLE FORCE PARTS OF THE CITY 
HAVE HAD POWER AND WATER RESTORED 
BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE STILL RUNNING 
SHORT 
ELECTRICITY AS WELL AS WATER SHORT SUPPLY CUT OFF 
AS FOR THOSE IN 
CHARGE STATE TELEVISION SHOWS OF 
BURMA'S SECRETIVE MILITARY LEADERS 
TAKING CONTROL VISITING THE 
INJURED IN HOSPITAL BUT THERE ARE 
SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER 
THIS COUNTRY CAN COPE WITHOUT A 
MASSIVE ESCALATION OF FOOD AID 
TONIGHT THE FIRST AIRLIFT OF AID 
ARRIVED IN RANGOON BURMA'S 
MILITARY GOVERNMENT HAS SHUNNED THE 
OUTSIDE WORLD FOR DECADES BUT NOW 
THEY HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ASK FOR 
HELP THE OPERATION HERE IS 
MAKESHIFT FOUR DAYS AFTER THIS 
DISASTER THEY ARE HAVING TO UNLOAD 
THIS FIRST SHIPMENT BY HAND 
OUR REPORTER THERE IN BURMA 
THE RELIEF EFFORT IS GATHERING PACE 
BRITAIN HAS OFFERED FIVE MILLION AND 
SOME OF BURMA'S CLOSES NEIGHBOURS 
ARE SENDING SUPPLIES TOO AID 
AGENCIES SAY ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
PROBLEMS IS GETTING VISAS SO THAT 
THEIR WORKERS CAN GET INTO THE 
COUNTRY OUR DIPLOMATIC 
CORRESPONDENT BRIDGET KENDALL HAS 
MORE DETAILS 
BURMA'S MILITARY LEADERS HAVE 
ADMITTED THEY NEED HELP BUT WITH 
DISASTERS OF THE SCALE THERE HAS TO 
BE A MASSIVE ALMOST MILITARY 
HUMANITARIAN OPERATION TO COPE BUT 
WILL THEY LET THAT MANY OUTSIDERS 
IN IN ACROSS THE WORLD SHIPMENTS ARE 
BEING ERODED BLANKETS AND 
GENERATORS FROM JAPAN IN THIS 
SINGAPORE WAREHOUSE BUT PEOPLE ARE 
NEEDED AS WELL AS AID IF RELIEF IS 
TO REACH REMOTE AREAS SWIFTLY THE 
DANGER IS THAT OTHERWISE THIS COULD 
ALL PILE UP IN RANGOON BURMA 
CLAIMS IT IS DOING ITS BEST AND HAS 
NOTHING TO HIDE BUT THE GENERALS 
WHO HAVE RULED FOR DECADES ARE 
NOTORIOUSLY SECRETIVE AND 
SUSPICIOUS TO OUTSIDERS ESPECIALLY 
TO THOSE LIKE THE UNITED STATES 
WHICH RECENTLY STEPPED UP SANCTIONS 
AGAINST BURMA 
LET THE UNITED 
STATES COME AND HELP YOU HELP THE 
PEOPLE OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO THE 
PEOPLE OF BURMA WE WANT TO HELP 
THEM DEAL WITH THIS TERRIBLE 
DISASTER AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT 
TO LIVE IN A FREE SOCIETY 
POINTEDLY PRESIDENT BUSH THEN 
ANNOUNCED HE WAS AWARDING A 
CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO BURMA'S 
OPPOSITION LEADER SHE IS BEING 
HELD UNDER HOUSE ARREST IN BURMA 
AND IS THE LEADER OF THE PRO 
DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT THAT LAST YEAR 
JOINED THOUSANDS OF MONKS IN STREET 
PROTESTS AGAINST THE REGIME THAT 
BRIEF OUTBURST OF REBELLION ENDED 
IN A CRACKDOWN AND NOW BURMA'S 
GENERALS WANT TO HOLD REFERENDUM 
AIMED THEIR CRITICS SAY AT 
CEMENTING THEIR GRIP ON POWER IT 
IS DUE THIS WEEKEND SO THEY MAY 
WELL FEAR A FOREIGN HUMANITARIAN 
OPERATION COULD UPSET THEIR 
POLITICAL PLANS BURMA'S GENERAL'S 
FACE A CHOICE THEY MAY WORRY THAT 
OUTSIDE HELP COULD WEAKEN THEIR 
GRIP BUT IF THEY DON'T LEAD 
AGENCIES IN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS 
OF PEOPLE COULD FACE CALAMITY AND 
THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE BLAME 
HUNDREDS OF VITAL INSTALLATIONS 
THROUGHOUT BRITAIN ARE VULNERABLE 
TO SEVERE FLOODING ACCORDING TO 
CONFIDENTIAL GOVERNMENT STUDY THIS 
PROGRAMME HAS SEEN THE CONCLUSIONS 
OF THE REPORT WHICH WAS CARRIED 
OUT IN THE WAKE OF LAST YEAR'S 
FLOODS THE COST OF PROTECTING THE 
SIDES INCLUDING ELECTRICITY SUPPLY 
STATIONS SEWAGE WORKS SCHOOLS AND 
HOSPITALS IS LIKELY TO BE AT LEAST 
ONE BILLION OUR ENVIRONMENT 
CORRESPONDENT DAVID SHUKMAN HAS 
THIS EXCLUSIVE REPORT 
IMAGINE IF THE NEXT FLOODS WE GET 
ARE WORSE THAN LAST SUMMER IF 
ENTIRE REGIONS ARE AFFECTED HOMES 
HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS COULD ALWAYS 
WATER AND SANITATION THESE ARE THE 
IMPLICATIONS OF AN INTERNAL 
GOVERNMENT REPORT I HAVE BEEN SHOWN 
TO THE FUTURE DANGERS OF FLOODING 
THIS WAS BATTLE LAST SUMMER TO 
KEEP THE LIGHT SUN THIS 
ELECTRICITY STATION NEAR GLOUCESTER 
WAS SO NEARLY OVERWHELMED THAT 
MINISTERS EVEN CONSIDERED 
EVACUATING HALF A MILLION PEOPLE 
DELIGHTS ON IT IS NIGHTMARE MOVE 
THEY MAY HAVE TO CARRY OUT SUNDAY 
TODAY IT IS PROTECTED BY LONG 
WALL OF PLASTIC AND GRAVEL BUT 
OFFICIALS HAVE ASSESSED THAT MUCH 
OF THE VITAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE 
COUNTRY IS STILL IN DANGER THE 
FACT THAT THIS PLACE CAME WITHIN 
INCHES OF BEING FLOODED LAST SUMMER 
PROVED ALARMING BUT I UNDERSTAND A 
CONFIDENTIAL GOVERNMENT STUDY HAS 
FOUND THAT THERE ARE LITERALLY 
HUNDREDS OF SITES LIKE THIS ALL 
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE 
FUNCTIONING OF THE COUNTRY BUT ALL 
AT SEVERE RISK FROM FLOODING L. 
HAVE SEEN THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE 
REPORT WHICH SPELLS OUT THAT 
HUNDREDS OF SITES ARE AT THE 
HIGHEST LEVELS OF CRITICALITY IT 
WARNS THAT FLOODING RISKS ARE 
PREDICTED TO RISE FURTHER MILLIONS 
DEPEND ON SITES LIKE THIS WITHOUT 
THEM EVERYTHING FROM MOBILE PHONES 
THE INTERNET 
AND STREET LIGHTING AND NEARLY DID WILL BE STOPPED AND NEARLY DID 
WE CAME VERY CLOSE 
TO FLOODING WHICH COULD HAVE CAUSED 
WIDESPREAD PROBLEMS THE COUNTRY 
WAS VERY FORTUNATE REMEMBER TENS 
OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THEIR HOMES 
AND BUSINESSES WERE DIRECTLY 
AFFECTED BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN A 
GREAT DEAL WORSE IT SEEMS STRANGE 
TO SAY IT BUT IN SOME WAYS LAST 
SUMMER WE WERE QUITE LUCKY ALL ALL THESE ISSUES OF ENVIRONMENT AND 
HEALTH HEALTH SO WHEN THE GOVERNMENT'S COBRA 
EMERGENCY COMMITTEE MET LAST SUMMER 
THE NIGHTMARE OF MASS EVACUATION 
WAS A REAL PROSPECT IT DAWNED ON 
OFFICIALS HOW FLOODING CAN TRIGGER 
A CHAIN REACTION OF DISASTERS 
POTENTIALLY WORSE THAN TERRORISM 
IF YOU COMPARE THE RESULTS OF 
TERRORIST ATTACK APPALLING AMOUNTS 
OF PEOPLE MAIMED AND KILLED WITH 
THE EFFECT OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS 
OF PEOPLE WITHOUT HEAT AND LIGHT 
WITHOUT TRANSPORT AND FRESH WATER 
SANITATION AND WITH ALL THE 
ATTENDANT PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS THE 
MATHEMATICS ARE CLEAR 
SAM GRAINGER 
WAS ONE OF A MILLION PEOPLE WHO 
WENT WITHOUT RUNNING WATER FOR 
NEARLY THREE WEEKS LAST SUMMER IT 
COULD EASILY BE MORE NEXT TIME IT IT FLOODED THE POWER STATION FLOODED 
BECAUSE THE WATER GOT CONTAMINATED 
WE COULD NOT USE IT BECAUSE OF 
THAT SUCH A WIDE AREA WAS AFFECTED 
WITH NO WATER FOR SO LONG ONE ONE POWER COMPANY C. E. ELECTRIC IN 
YORKSHIRE HAD ITS CONTROL CENTRE 
FLOODED HOW MANY OTHERS ARE STILL 
VULNERABLE THE UTILITY COMPANIES 
SAY THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY CAN 
HOW BIG A JOB IS IT TO TRY TO 
FLOOD PROOF YOUR FACILITY 
THAT IS 
IMPOSSIBLE TO GET TO A POINT WHERE 
THERE IS NEVER ANY RISK IS 
IMPOSSIBLE IT IS BUILDING A WALL 
AROUND A SITE AND INSTALLING PUMPS 
HOW HIGH SHOULD ALL BE TO MAKE IT 
FLOOD TRUTH IT WOULD HAVE TO BE 
RIDICULOUSLY HIGH FLOOD PROOF 
WE NEED A MEASURED RESPONSE 
KEEPING THE WATER OUT OF THE SITES 
COULD COST ONE MILLION ONE BILLION 
EXPECT HARD BARGAINING ABOUT WHO 
SHOULD PAY A VETERAN CAMPAIGNER 
SAYS IT IS UP TO THE GOVERNMENT TO 
SAVE KEY SITES 
SPEND MONEY TO 
PROTECT THEM PROPERLY NOW A FEW 
YEARS DOWN THE LINE WE ARE GOING 
TO LOSE IT ALL AGAIN IT IS GOING 
TO BE A RE RUN AND THEY WILL SAY 
THEY SHOULD HAVE ACTED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
TONIGHT'S LEAKED REPORT IS CALL 
FOR ACTION BUT MANY ARE 
QUESTIONING IF IT WILL COME SOON 
ENOUGH ENOUGH DAVID CAMERON THE CONSERVATIVE 
LEADER SAYS HE WILL MAKE THE 
CONTROVERSY ABOUT THE TEN P. TAX BAND 
AT THE CENTRE OF HIS PARTY'S 
CAMPAIGN IN THE CREWE AND MANDARIC 
BY ELECTION HE WANTS THE PRIME 
MINISTER TO SPELL OUT EXACTLY HOW 
THOSE AFFECTED WILL BE COMPENSATED 
NANTWICH GORDON BROWN HAS COME 
UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE FORMER HOME 
SECRETARY CHARLES CLARKE WHO 
CALLED FOR POLICY CHANGES 
ALL CHANGE ALL CHANGE THAT CRY 
HEARD SO OFTEN AT CREWE INTERCHANGE 
IS THE ONE THAT TORY VOTERS MAY 
SOON DELIVER THE CONSERVATIVE 
LEADER AND SNIFFS THE CHANCE OF HIS 
PARTY'S FIRST BY ELECTION GAIN IN 
MORE THAN A QUARTER OF CENTURY 
BUT POLITICAL SUCCESS COMES AT A 
PRICE PEOPLE WANT ANSWERS WILL WILL YOU REDUCE THE TWENTY PER CENT BACK TO TEN PER CENT 
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
AFFECTED BY IT 
I CAN'T PROMISE 
THAT BUT WE CAN STOP THE 
GOVERNMENT IN THEIR TRACKS ONE ONE LAST TIME WOULD YOU GIVE US TEN PER CENT 
BACK IF YOU WERE ELECTED AS PRIME 
MINISTER THAT IS WHAT WE ARE 
ASKING THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE IN 
CREWE AND NANTWICH WANT 
PEOPLE IN 
CREWE AND NANTWICH CANNOT WAIT TWO 
YEARS FOR A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT 
YOU CAN GET ACTION NOW IF WE SEND A 
BIG ENOUGH MESSAGE TO GORDON BROWN 
TO SAY THAT HE WILL HELP THOSE FIFTY THREE 
MILLION PEOPLE 
LABOUR FEARS THAT 
THOSE WHO SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF 
THE TEN P. TAX CUT WILL PUNISH THEM 
HERE AS THEY DID ALL OVER THE 
COUNTRY LAST WEEK ONE LOSING 
CANDIDATE IN CREWE IS CERTAIN WHY 
IT HAPPENED 
THE TEN P. TAX RATE AND 
ITS ABOLITION WAS A KEY FACTOR IT 
WAS A VERDICT BY THE ELECTORATE IT 
WAS NOT ON THE OR LOCAL LABOUR 
CANDIDATES IT WAS A VERDICT ON THE 
GOVERNMENT ON ME THEY HAVE 
ACCEPTED THAT 
TODAY THE 
CHANCELLOR MET REBEL M. P.'S TO ASSURE 
THEM THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD REALLY 
GOT THE MESSAGE THEIR LEADER'S 
LEADERS EMERGED CONVINCED MY MY SPIRITS ARE RAISED BY THE 
COMPREHENSIVE INQUIRY THEY ARE 
LOOKING AT THE OPTIONS WHICH IS 
WHAT WE WANTED 
BACK IN CREWE THE 
LIB DEMS ARE ALSO HOPING TO BENEFIT 
FROM LABOUR'S WOES 
A TAX GIMMICK 
FOR WHICH POORER PEOPLE ON LOWER 
INCOME INCLUDING LARGE NUMBERS IN 
THIS AREA A LOW PAID AREA THEY 
WILL PAY FOR IT 
AT THE TREASURY 
CIVIL SERVANTS ARE WORKING LONG AND 
HARD TO TRY TO FIND AN ANSWER TO 
THE GOVERNMENT'S TEN P. TAX NIGHTMARE 
THERE IS THOUGH NO EASY MONEY AND 
THERE ARE NO EASY ANSWERS AND 
MINISTERS FEAR THAT IF THEY RUSH 
OUT A SOLUTION IT MIGHT FALL APART 
UNDER PRESSURE TAX CHANGES MAY 
WELL NOT ARRIVE SOON ENOUGH TO HELP 
LABOUR IN CREWE TODAY A FORMER 
MINISTER DEMANDED CHANGES TOO ON 
PLANNED POST OFFICE CLOSURES AND 
PLANS TO INCREASE DETENTION WITHOUT 
TRIAL 
COMING UP INSIDE ZIMBABWE WE 
FIND MORE EVIDENCE THAT ROBERT 
MUGABE IS PUNISHING OPPOSITION 
SUPPORTERS THE ACCOUNTS WE HAVE 
HEARD SUGGEST THAT THERE IS A 
SYSTEMATIC ATTEMPT ON THE WAY TO 
ALTER THE ELECTORAL LANDSCAPE 
ARMED POLICE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN 
A SIEGE WITH A GUNMAN AT A HOUSE IN 
WEST LONDON THIS EVENING LET'S 
JOIN OUR CORRESPONDENT NOW 
IT WAS JUST BEFORE THE EVENING 
RUSH HOUR THAT THE POLICE WERE 
CALLED FOLLOWING REPORTS OF GUNFIRE 
IN THIS SQUARE IN AFFLUENT WEST 
LONDON THERE WAS AN EXCHANGE OF 
GUNFIRE JUST BEFORE NINE O'CLOCK THE 
SITUATION DETERIORATED FURTHER 
SHOTS WERE FIRED FROM THE HOUSE 
THE POLICE RETURNED FIRE THEY MAY 
HAVE CRITICALLY INJURED THE GUNMAN 
AT THAT POINT THEN THERE WAS THE 
SOUND OF STUN GRENADES AS THE 
POLICE WENT IN 
LEFT PEOPLE HERE IN CHELSEA 
ABSOLUTELY STUNNED IN THE MARKHAM 
SQUARE AREA AT THE MOMENT THERE 
IS NO CLUE AS TO WHAT THE GUNMAN'S 
MOTIVE MAY HAVE BEEN 
OPENING UP THE POSTAL MARKET TO 
COMPETITION HAS BROUGHT NO 
SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT FOR CONSUMERS 
AND SMALLER BUSINESSES AN 
INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE POSTAL 
SERVICE SAYS THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS 
UNTENABLE AND THAT ACTION IS 
NEEDED TO SECURE ROYAL MAIL'S 
FUTURE OUR BUSINESS EDITOR ROBERT 
PESTON REPORTS 
ROYAL MAIL'S LETTERS MONOPOLY WAS 
BROKEN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IT 
WAS THE CULMINATION OF GOVERNMENT 
POLICY TO BRING THE POSTAL INDUSTRY 
INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BUT A REVIEW 
COMMISSIONED BY THE BUSINESS 
MINISTRY TODAY SAID THAT THE POLICY 
IS HURTING BUT NOT WORKING OR AT 
LEAST NOT YET 
COMPETITION IS 
RELATIVELY YOUNG IN THE POSTAL 
MARKET A FULL LIBERALISATION 
HAPPENED IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SIX IF YOU 
LOOK AT OTHER MARKETS LIKE 
TELECOMS COMPETITION TAKES QUITE A 
LONG TIME TO GET GEAR UP NO NO SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS HAVE COME FROM 
COMPETITION SAYS THE REVIEW 
WE DO 
NOT GET SUNDAY COLLECTIONS WE DO 
NOT GET TWO DELIVERIES IN A DAY MY 
POST IS ALWAYS TERRIBLY LATE I 
OFTEN DO NOT GET IT UNTIL LUNCHTIME 
I DON'T THINK YOU GET VALUE FOR 
MONEY 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT A CHOICE ONE MONEY WAY OR THE OTHER YOU'RE STUCK WITH 
ONE OR NOTHING AREN'T YOU REALLY 
BUT IF CUSTOMERS ARE SAW SO TOO IS 
ROYAL MAIL WHICH HAS REDUCED STAFF 
NUMBERS BY ALMOST FIFTY THOUSAND SLASHED 
MORE THAN ONE BILLION FROM COSTS 
BUT IS STILL IN SEVERE FINANCIAL 
DIFFICULTIES 
THERE IS A DECLINE IN DIFFICULTIES THE LETTERS BUSINESS IN THIS 
COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD 
ROYAL MAIL'S PROBLEMS GO DEEPER 
THAN THAT A HUGE PENSION FUND HOLE 
SORTING OFFICES THAT ARE MASSIVELY 
OUT OF DATE AND WHAT IT SEES AS 
THE UNFAIR ADVANTAGES OF ITS 
COMPETITORS 
WE COMPETE WITH ROYAL COMPETITORS MAIL HEAD ON AND WE NOW HAVE TEN PER CENT 
MARKET SHARE WITHIN FOUR YEARS OF 
OPERATION SO THAT'S PRETTY 
SUCCESSFUL YOU DO NOT NECESSARILY 
HAVE TO HAVE SOMEONE THAT DELIVERS 
IT TO END WE OPERATE EFFECTIVELY 
USING THE ROYAL MAIL AS OUR FINAL 
MAIL DELIVERY COMPANY MAKE THAT 
DELIVERS END TO END IT IS PART OF 
WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE UNIVERSAL 
SERVICE OBLIGATION AND IT IS 
SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT 
WANTS TO PRESERVE BUT IT IS 
UNCLEAR WHETHER IT IS SUSTAINABLE 
CAN THEY REALLY BE ONE PRICE TO 
SEND A LETTER FIVE MILES AND FIVE HUNDRED 
MILES CAN THERE REALLY BE 
THE REVIEW SAYS THAT PUTTING IT ALL 
TOGETHER AGAIN WILL NOT BE AN 
OVERNIGHT DELIVERY 
IN ZIMBABWE ROBERT MUGABE'S RULING 
ZANU P. F. PARTY CLAIMS IT DOESN'T 
WANT ANY VIOLENCE AS IT STARTS 
CAMPAIGNING FOR A SECOND VOTE IN 
THE DISPUTED PRESIDENTIAL ECTION 
BUT THE OPPOSITION LEADER MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI WHO INSISTS HE WON 
OUTRIGHT IN THE FIRST ROUND HASN'T 
YET AGREED TO RUN OFF FIVE AND 
HALF WEEKS AFTER THE FIRST VOTE 
THE B. B. C. HAS UNCOVERED YET MORE 
EVIDENCE OF INTIMIDATION BY 
MUGABE'S SUPPORTERS IN RURAL AREAS 
B. B. C. NEWS IS BANNED FROM ZIMBABWE 
BUT ORLA GUERIN WENT UNDERCOVER TO 
SEND THIS REPORT 
MUCH OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN 
ZIMBABWE IS HIDDEN FROM VIEW JUST 
THE WAY PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE 
LIKES IT BUT HERE IN THE RURAL 
AREAS THERE IS A NEW HARVEST OF 
FREER PLANTED BY THE RULING PARTY 
AND ITS HENCHMEN WE TRAVELLED DEEP 
INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE TO GET THE 
FULL PICTURE AND THIS IS HOW IT 
LOOKS BATTERED AND BRUISED THIS 
WOMAN ATTACKED ON HER OWN DOORSTEP 
WE HAVE DECIDED TO CONCEAL HER 
IDENTITY IDENTITY THEY WERE BEATING ME 
UP ON THE CHEEK AND ONE KICKED ME 
ON THE FACE ALSO ON MY HEAD THE THE AIM IS ELECTORAL CLEANSING TO 
DRIVE OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS OUT OF 
THEIR VOTING AREAS OR MAKE THEM 
TOO AFRAID TO VOTE FOR THE M. D. C. 
AGAIN IN THIS OPPOSITION 
STRONGHOLD WE MET LOCAL LEADERS 
WHO EXPLAINED THE MECHANICS OF THE 
CAMPAIGN THEY SAY IT IS LED BY 
RULING PARTY OFFICIALS SO CALLED 
WAR VETERANS AND A SENIOR ARMY 
OFFICER 
THEY TOLD US THAT THEY TOLD US 
THAT IF WE DID NOT VOTE FOR ZANU P. F. 
AND MUGABE LOST THERE WOULD BE WAR 
WAR SAYS THIS COUNCILLOR THEY 
SAY THE INTIMIDATION BEGAN AT THE 
TOP WITH LOCAL CHIEFS WHO PASSED 
THE THREATS DOWN TO VILLAGE ELDERS 
THE CHIEFS' HEAD MAN TOLD US THE 
MESSAGE FROM ZANU P. F. WAS TO GO 
UNTIL THE PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THE 
PRESIDENT IF THEY DID NOT THEY 
WOULD SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM 
THE ACCOUNTS WE HAVE HEARD HERE ARE 
CONSISTENT WITH THOSE FROM 
ELSEWHERE THERE IS A SYSTEMATIC 
ATTEMPT UNDER WAY TO ALTER THE 
ELECTORAL LANDSCAPE THESE LEADERS 
HAVE TOLD US IT WON'T WORK HERE 
THEIR COMMUNITIES WOULD BE 
INTIMIDATED BUT HUMAN RIGHTS 
ACTIVISTS ARE WORRIED THAT IN OTHER 
PLACES FEAR IS ALREADY TAKING HOLD 
AND THERE IS ANOTHER WEAPON IN THIS 
CAMPAIGN HUNGER THE CROP IS DEAD 
IN THE FIELDS PEOPLE HERE 
DESPERATELY NEED MAIZE BUT THEY 
SAY WITHOUT A PARTY CARD THEY 
WON'T GET IT ONE MORE WAY ROBERT 
MUGABE IS WEAKENING THE OPPOSITION 
BEFORE A SECOND ROUND MANY WHO 
LONG FOR CHANGE HAVE BEEN FORCED 
INTO THE SHADOWS HIDING OUT IN 
PLACES LIKE THIS HOMELESS AND 
VOICELESS THIS MAN IS RISKING HIS 
LIFE TO HELP THEM HE DOES NOT 
SLEEP AT HOME SO HERE IS WHERE HE 
LAYS HIS HEAD THIS IS A COUNTRY 
WHERE FEAR IS REPLACING HOPE 
AMERICAN VOTERS ARE TAKING PART IN 
THE LAST MAJOR DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
PRIMARIES TO DECIDE WHO WILL BE THE 
PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE LATER 
THIS YEAR BARACK OBAMA THE 
CURRENT LEADER AND HILLARY CLINTON 
ARE BATTLING FOR EVERY VOTE IN 
NORTH CAROLINA AND INDIANA THE 
LATEST POLLS SUGGEST THAT MRS. 
CLINTON IS CUTTING BARACK OBAMA'S 
LEAD IN NORTH CAROLINA JUSTIN WEBB 
IS IN WASHINGTON AND HOW DO YOU 
SEE THINGS JUSTIN 
THIS IS 
ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT FOR HILLARY 
CLINTON THIS EVENING BECAUSE IT 
SHE DOES WELL SHE SETS TO ONE SIDE 
TO AN EXTENT THIS WHOLE ARGUMENT 
THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY NEEDS TO 
GO WITH THE DEMOCRATIC WINNER 
BARACK OBAMA IT WOULD INTRODUCE 
THE IDEA THAT IT NEEDS TO GO NOT 
WITH HIM BUT WITH STRENGTH SHE A 
POLE SHE WAS INTRODUCED BY ONE OF 
HER SUPPORTERS THE OTHER DAY AS 
BEING THE CANDIDATE OF TESTICULAR 
FORTITUDE A PHRASE WHICH RAISED 
SOME EYEBROWS BUT SHE REALLY IS ON 
FIRE SHE IS GETTING A RAPTUROUS 
WELCOME SHE IS LOOKING STRONG AND 
VIGOROUS AND HAPPIER ON THE 
CAMPAIGN TRAIL THEIR SHE HAS LOOKED 
FOR SOME MONTHS ON THE OTHER HAND 
BARACK OBAMA WHEN YOU LOOK AT HIM 
HE HAS BEEN FORCED TO DROP HIS 
TRADEMARK RALLIES WITH LOTS OF 
ADORING SUPPORTERS AND INSTEAD OPT 
FOR MEETINGS WITH PEOPLE WITH HARD 
HATS ON IN AN EFFORT TO REACH OUT 
TO DEMOCRATIC PARTY CONSTITUENCIES 
WHOM HE KNOWS HE HAS FAILED TO 
REACH BUT THE PROBLEM FOR BARACK 
OBAMA IS THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS 
FOUND SOMETHING OF A TRADEMARK HAD 
GUTS IN THIS IS REALLY IMPRESSING 
PEOPLE PEOPLE THIS TINY LITTLE WOMAN IS GOING TO 
TAKE ON THE BUREAUCRACY IN 
WASHINGTON CORRUPTION IN THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STAND UP FOR 
WHAT IS WHITE THEY HIT HER AND SHE 
GETS BACK UP WHAT IS RIGHT SHE 
COMES BACK WITH FEROCITY AND AND THAT WOMAN BY THE WAY IS A 
REPUBLICAN SO HILLARY CLINTON IS 
REALLY REACHING OUT TO PEOPLE THE 
RISK FOR THE PARTY IS THAT SHE GOES 
FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH AND THE 
WHOLE THING GOES TO THE PARTY 
CONVENTION AT THE END OF AUGUST 
THE PROBLEM OF DRUGS IN ATHLETICS 
IS IN IT EVEN SHARPER FOCUS WITH 
JUST NINETY THREE DAYS TO GO TO THE OLYMPIC 
GAMES IN BEIJING IN AMERICA THE 
MAN WHO COACHED MARION JONES THE 
CHAMPION SPRINTER WHO ADMITTED 
DOPING OFFENCES GOES ON TRIAL SOON 
THE CASE COULD LEAD TO MORE STARS 
BEING FORCED TO CONFESS OUR SPORTS 
EDITOR LOOKS AT HOW THE AMERICAN 
LEGAL SYSTEM IS INCREASINGLY BEING 
USED TO TRY TO CATCH THE CHEATS 
THESE YOUNG AMERICANS MAY DREAM OF 
OLYMPIC GOLD BUT THEY CANNOT 
ESCAPE THE SHADOW OF DRUGS WHICH 
HANGS OVER THEIR SPORT A SHADOW 
WHICH CAUSES MANY TO DOUBT WHETHER 
MEDALS CAN EVER BE ONE WITHOUT 
CHEATING ALONGSIDE THE YOUNG 
HOPEFULS AT THIS EVENT IN 
PHILADELPHIA OR STARS LIKE THE 
WORLD'S FASTEST WOMAN ALLYSON 
FELIX SHE IS EVEN TAKING VOLUNTARY 
TESTS TO SHOW SHE REALLY IS CLEAN 
WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE 
BELIEVE THAT WE WILL DO WHATEVER IS 
NECESSARY TO SUBMIT TO THESE TESTS 
AND THEY ARE ADVANCED TESTS WE ARE 
WILLING TO DO IT WE ARE GOING IN 
ON OUR DAYS OFF WE ARE DRIVING FAR 
FROM A HOUSES TO DO THESE TESTS 
SPORTS ORGANISATIONS MAY TEST 
ATHLETES MORE THAN EVER BUT IT IS 
STILL NOT ENOUGH IN THE UNITED 
STATES THE FORCE OF LAW IS NOW 
BEING USED TO CATCH THE CHEATS IN 
THIS OLYMPIC YEAR AMERICA HOPES TO 
CONVINCE THE FANS AND YOUNG 
COMPETITORS THAT THE FIGHT AGAINST 
DOPING CAN BE WON HAVING BEEN IN 
DENIAL ABOUT DRUGS IN SPORT FOR SO 
LONG AMERICA WHICH ALWAYS WANTS 
TO BE NUMBER ONE IS DETERMINED TO 
PROVE IT CAN PUNISH THE CHEATS AND 
SHOW THE WORLD HOW TO DO IT MARION 
JONES WAS JAILED FOR LYING TO 
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES INVESTIGATING 
FRAUD IT WAS ONLY THEN THAT SHE 
WAS FORCED TO ADMIT SHE HAD ALSO 
LIED ABOUT TAKING DRUGS IN SAN 
FRANCISCO IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS 
YET MORE ATHLETES COULD BE EXPOSED 
AS CHEATS WHEN A LEADING COACH 
GOES ON TRIAL HERE THIS IS THE 
CITY WHERE IT ALL BEGAN WITH THE 
BALCO LABORATORY BEING CAUGHT 
SUPPLYING DRUGS TO ATHLETES 
TREATING THEM MORE LIKE RACEHORSES 
THAN HUMANS NOW HAVING SERVED HIS 
PRISON SENTENCE COOL OR IS READY 
TO SHARE HIS EXPERTISE WITH THE 
AUTHORITIES VICTOR CONTE IS 
READY 
THE OLYMPIC GAMES ARE A READY FRAUD IT IS ALL ABOUT THE 
TELEVISION REVENUE THIS IS ABOUT 
MONEY THOSE WHO CONTROL THE MONEY 
CONTROL THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP 
EFFECTIVE ANTI DOPING POLICIES AND 
PROCEDURES THEY ARE STILL IN ACT 
TO THIS DAY THEY ARE BETTER THAN 
THEY WERE PRE KNOWN AS BUT THEY 
ARE STILL INEFFECTIVE 
TESTING NOW 
IS MORE VIGOROUS THAN EVER ALSO IN 
AN OLYMPIC YEAR PRE BALCO BUT 
AMERICA'S MOST FAMOUS OLYMPIAN 
BELIEVES THAT DOPING MUST BE 
CRIMINALISED 
I THINK THEY OUGHT TO CRIMINALISED COME TOGETHER LIKE THEY DID WITH 
MARION JONES THEY USED THE 
GOVERNMENT TO DO IT AND FIND OUT 
I WOULD CHANGE LAWS BECAUSE IF YOU 
TEST POSITIVE WHY CAN'T IT BE 
ILLEGAL 
AMERICA BELIEVES THAT IT ILLEGAL HAS ALREADY FOUND A SYSTEM TO CATCH 
DRUGS CHEATS AND IN STARS LIKE 
ALLYSON FELIX IT HAS A NEW IMAGE 
TO REASSURE FANS THAT THEIR 
ATHLETES CAN BE CLEAN 
THERE IS MORE NATIONAL AND 
INTERNATIONAL NEWS ON THE NEWS 
TUNNEL BUT NOW THE NEWS TEAMS 
WHERE YOU ARE GOOD EVENING ON
