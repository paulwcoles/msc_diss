AND COMPLICATED INVESTIGATION 
CONTINUES 
YOU COULD SOON TEXT YOUR MATES FROM 
THE SKY TODAY IT WAS DECIDED THAT 
IF YOU ARE FLYING IN EUROPE YOU 
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO USE YOUR PHONE 
CALLS COULD START AS SOON AS NEXT 
MONTH BUT BEWARE ABOUT TELLING 
YOUR MATES TOO MUCH ABOUT THE 
BORDER HE WAS SITTING NEXT TO IT 
BECAUSE THERE WILL BE MORE 
EXPENSIVE THAN USUAL 
CONGRATULATIONS TO CARDIFF CITY A 
CRACKING GOAL BY JOE LEDLEY PUT THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP SIDE INTO THE F. A. CUP 
FINAL YESTERDAY TODAY MORE GOOD 
NEWS FOR THE BLUEBIRDS BECAUSE THEY 
ARE WELSH CLUB WINNING THE F. A. CUP 
WOULDN'T AUTOMATICALLY QUALIFY THEM 
FOR THE UEFA CUP NEXT SEASON BUT 
NOW THE PEOPLE WHO RUN EUROPEAN 
FOOTBALL SAY THEY MAY STILL THERE 
AND PLAY IN THE COMPETITION ANYWAY 
NOW ADD THE OLYMPIC TORCH ANOTHER 
CONTROVERSIAL DAY AS IT CONTINUES 
ITS JOURNEY ACROSS THE WORLD AHEAD 
OF THIS SUMMER'S GAMES IN CHINA 
TODAY THE TORTURES IN PARIS BUT 
ORGANISERS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO STOP 
THE CEREMONY EARLY AFTER MORE 
VIOLENT ANTIQUE CHINA PROTESTS 
WHEN THE TORCH WAS IN LONDON 
YESTERDAY THIRTY SEVEN PROTESTERS WERE 
ARRESTED THIS TORCH IS A SYMBOL OF 
THE OLYMPICS IT'S MEANT TO DRUM UP 
SUPPORT FOR THE GAMES THAT ARE 
HAPPENING IN BEIJING THIS SUMMER 
SO IT'S BEEN TAKEN AROUND THE WORLD 
THE TROUBLE IS EVERY WHERE IT'S 
GONE IT'S BEEN AT THE CENTRE OF 
CHAOS IT'S MEANT TO BE A SIGN OF 
PEACE BUT ANTI CHINA PROTESTERS 
DISRUPTED THE LIGHTING CEREMONY IN 
GREECE PEOPLE WARNED THE POLICE 
THEY WOULD USE THE LONDON LEG OF 
THE RELATE TO SHOW HOW UNHAPPY THEY 
ARE WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AND 
THE WEIGHT IT IS TREATING PEOPLE 
THERE WERE LOTS OF PROTESTERS ALONG 
THIS ROUTE LOTS OF PEOPLE WERE 
PROTESTING ABOUT TIBET IT'S RULED 
BY CHINA BUT MANY PEOPLE THINK THE 
WAY THEY RUN IT AND TREATED IS 
UNFAIR THIRTY SEVEN PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED 
YESTERDAY AND ONE PROTESTER TRIED 
TO GRAB THE FLAME FROM FORMER BLUE 
PETER PRESENTER KONNIE HUQ THERE THERE WERE SOME PROTESTERS ALONG THE 
ROUTE PROTESTING FOR THE FREE 
TIBET CAUSE BUT I LEAPT OUT IN 
FRONT OF ME AND WRESTLED ME FOR THE 
TORCH BUT WE MANAGED TO KEEP THE 
FLAME ALIGHT 
AS YOU CAN SEE FROM 
THIS RALLY A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL 
STRONGLY ABOUT WHAT THE CHINESE 
GOVERNMENT IS DOING BUT SOME 
PEOPLE THINK A SPORTING EVENT ISN'T 
THE RIGHT PLACE TO TALK ABOUT 
POLITICS 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S POLITICS MEANT TO BE A CELEBRATION 
DO YOU 
THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE PROTESTING 
YES I THINK THEY SHOULD BE 
PROTESTING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY 
NEED 
THE TORCH WAS TAKEN TO FRANCE NEED LAST NIGHT IT WAS CARRIED THROUGH 
PARIS IN THE MIDDLE OF VIOLENT 
PROTESTS TODAY IT'S MEANT TO TOUR 
UP UNTIL THE GAMES IN AUGUST BUT 
IT LOOKS LIKE TROUBLE COULD FOLLOW 
IT ALL OF THE WAY IT'S BEEN AN 
EVENT WILL COUPLE OF DAYS AND WE'VE 
HAD LOADS OF COMMENTS FROM YOU 
ABOUT THIS ADAM HAS BEEN GOING 
THROUGH THE NEWSROUND IN BOX 
THE WEBSITE HAS BEEN BURNING UP 
WITH THIS HARRIET THINKS THAT 
PROTESTING IS A FANTASTIC IDEA SHE 
SAYS PUTTING THE OLYMPICS UNDER 
THREAT IS A GENIUS WAY TO GET HEARD 
CHINA WILL GET EMBARRASSED IF THIS 
CARRIES ON GEORGINA SAYS JUDGING 
BY THE NUMBER OF PROTESTS AROUND 
THE WORLD CHINA SHOULD NEVER HAVE 
BEEN ALLOWED TO HAVE THE OLYMPIC 
GAMES AND THE FIRST PLACE BUT TEN 
YEAR OLD JENNY FROM LONDON ISN'T 
QUITE SO SURE SHE SAYS I CAN HAVE 
ONE TO ENCOURAGE THE PROTESTERS BUT 
I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD WRECK THE 
OLYMPICS SOME OF YOU DISAGREE 
QUITE STRONGLY DUNCAN WROTE I'M 
SO ANGRY THE OLYMPICS ONLY COME 
ROUND ONCE EVERY FOUR YEARS SO WHY 
DON'T WE ALL JUST ENJOY THEM ROBIN 
THINKS THE OLYMPIC GAMES SHOULD BE 
ABOUT NATIONS COMING TOGETHER AND 
HARMONY IN THE WHOLE WORLD KEEP 
YOUR COMMENTS COMING IN FINALLY 
YOU MIGHT HAVE FLOWN IN AN 
AEROPLANE BEFORE BUT I BET YOU'VE 
NEVER TAKEN TO THE SKIES IN A CAR 
OR A GIANT PINK BIRD L. THINK IT'S 
BEST TO LEAVE THAT TO A FEW BRAVE 
GET RATHER CREATIVE PEOPLE LIKE 
THIS LOT FROM AUSTRALIA YOU MIGHT 
WANT TO PACK YOUR FLIP FLOPS FOR 
YOUR NEXT SUMMER HOLIDAY BUT MY 
ADVICE IS DON'T TRY AND FLY THERE 
ARE IN A FLIP FLOP TOO TEAMS FROM 
ACROSS AUSTRALIA GOT TOGETHER IN 
SYDNEY HARBOUR TO LAUNCH HOME MADE 
FLYING MACHINES OFF A PIER 
AMAZINGLY THE AIM OF THE 
COMPETITION WAS TO STAY IN THE AIR 
AS LONG AS POSSIBLE YOU WOULD 
THINK A MASSIVE BIRD WOULD HAVE A 
GOOD CHANCE I'M NOT SURE THE EGG 
IS GOING TO HELP THOUGH NO 
STRAIGHT INTO THE POND FOR THE 
FEATHERED TEAM AND A RESCUE JOB FOR 
THE EGG WHO LOOKS MORE THAN A BIT 
SCRAMBLED THE CROWD LOOKED 
IMPRESSED BUT NOT MANY HIGH SCORES 
FROM THE JUDGES BETTER LUCK NEXT 
TIME SURELY FOUR WHEELS COULD GO 
THE DISTANCE ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY 
ARE BEING PUSHED BY THESE BIG OLD 
BLOKES BASS AND YOUR SEAT BELTS 
OR SHOULD THAT BE ARMBANDS I'M NOT 
SURE THAT CAR IS GOING ANYWHERE 
SOON LET'S HOPE NONE OF THESE 
BRAVE BUT SLIGHTLY CRAZY PILOTS 
EVER GET TO FLY TO RIO PLANE THAT 
LANDING LOOKED LIKE IT STUNG L. WAS 
THINKING WE COULD GET A NEWSROUND 
TEAM TOGETHER FOR NEXT YEAR BUT 
HAVING SEEN THAT MAY BE NOT WE 
HAVE MORE HEADLINES AT SIX TWENTY FIVE P. M. ON 
THE CBBC 
I WANT YOU BACK BY THE JACKSON FIVE 
OH BABY I WAS BLIND TO LET YOU GO 
BUT NOW SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU IN HER ARMS 
I WANT YOU BACK 
INTRODUCING THE JACKSON FIVE
