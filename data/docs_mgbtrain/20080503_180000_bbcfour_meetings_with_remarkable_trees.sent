WE LIVE TOGETHER BECAUSE WE LOVE EACH OTHER 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THESE TWO SEVERLY AUTISTIC CHILDREN 
HAD PIONEERING THERAPY TO HELP THEM SPEAK 
WHAT DO YOU WANT I WANT APPLE 
THIS POLITICIAN WASN'T TAKING ANY PRISONERS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE 
YOU EITHER BE KILLED BY THEM OR KILL THEM I WANT TO SEE THEM DEAD 
AND IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT FIFTEEN PEOPLE SPENT AN ENTIRE YEAR LIVING IN THE IRON AGE 
BREAKFAST WAS ALMOST ALWAYS A PORRIDGE OF BOILED WHEAT WITH MILK 
AND HONEY IF THERE WAS ANY 
NOW A NEW SERIES CATCHES UP WITH THE CHARACTERS 
FROM SOME OF THE BEST B. B. C. DOCUMENTARIES OF THE LAST FORTY YEARS 
AND FINDS OUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT 
BEHIND ME IS ONE OF THE FINEST EXAMPLES OF A BROAD LEAVED LIME 
YOU'LL SEE ANYWHERE IN EUROPE 
WE'RE IN A HOUSE WITH AN ATMOSPHERE AND A STYLE ALL OF ITS OWN 
IT'S A PIECE OF ARCHITECTURE FROM A VERY DEFINITE POINT IN TIME 
IT'S TWENTY FOUR F. T. EIGHT I. N. IN GIRTH WHICH MAKES IT 
BY FAR THE LARGEST BROAD LEAVED LIME IN BRITAIN 
AS I LOOK AROUND THE HOUSE NOW WHAT A STYLISH INTERIOR 
IT'S ACTUALLY THE VERY HEIGHT OF FASHION AND STYLE FOR THE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTIES 
VERY DIFFICULT HOUSE TO BUILD REQUIRING VERY SPECIAL TECHNIQUES 
NOT THE USUAL FOUNDATIONS 
THE TREE'S OVER FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OF AGE THE OLDEST BROAD LEAVED LIME IN BRITAIN 
IT'S ASTONISHING TO BE IN A HOUSE WHERE THERE SIMPLY ISN'T ANY WIRING YOU MIGHT SEE A BIT OF CANDLE WAX 
AND THAT IS THE ONLY FORM OF ARTIFICIAL ILLUMINATION HERE IT IS JUST AS THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY LEFT IT 
THERE'S NO HEATING I DON'T SUPPOSE THEY EVER NEEDED ANY HEATING 
IT MIGHT'VE BEEN A NID D'AMOUR A LITTLE LOVE NEST 
BELOW ME IN THIS GREAT CHASM ORIGINALLY THE CENTRE OF THE TREE IS NEW GROWTH 
LOOKING DOWN AT THE FLOOR I SEE COUNTRY HOUSE QUALITY FLOORBOARDS 
IT'S A HIGH QUALITY INTERIOR WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ATTRIBUTES 
IT'S A REAL CHARACTER TREE OF COURSE AS WELL AS ALL THAT 
IT HAS THIS REMARKABLE TREEHOUSE WITHIN IT 
THERE HAS BEEN A HOUSE ON THE SITE OF PITCHFORD HALL SINCE THE ELEVENTH CENTURY 
BOTH TREE AND TREEHOUSE WERE NOTED BY CARTOGRAPHERS ON THIS MAP OF ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETY TWO 
FOR THE HOUSE TO BE BUILT IN A TREE IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETY TWO IT MUST'VE BEEN ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
FAIRLY MATURE TO ACCOMMODATE THE TREEHOUSE 
SO THAT GIVES SOME INDICATION OF THE AGE OF FOUR HUNDRED YEARS PLUS 
IT'S A VERY PROMINENT POSITION ON THE ESTATE 
ON TOP OF A HILL CLEARLY VISIBLE FROM THE HOUSE 
REALLY IT WAS A STATUS SYMBOL 
BEFORE THE DAYS OF THE LATER CEDARS OF LEBANON AND WELLINGTONIAS 
AND EVENTUALLY THE B. M. W. ON THE DRIVE IT WILL HAVE BEEN LOOK AT MY LIME TREE 
WELL I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO INHERIT THE TREE 
THE HOUSE IN THE TREE AND THE HALL IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO VERY UNEXPECTEDLY 
AND SUDDENLY FOUND MYSELF THE PROUD OWNER OF ALL THESE LOVELY THINGS 
IT STRUCK US ALMOST IMMEDIATELY 
THAT THE PRIORITY WAS TO PRESERVE AND NURTURE THE TREE AND THE TREEHOUSE 
FIRST WE HAD TO LOOK AT IT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A TREE SURGEON 
OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT THE TREE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE TREEHOUSE 
THEN IT WAS LOOKED AT FROM AN ENGINEERING POINT OF VIEW AND THEN FROM AN ARCHITECTURAL POINT OF VIEW 
AND THEN IT WAS REALLY RESTORED 
PRIOR TO THE COLTHURSTS AND ITS CURRENT ARABIAN OWNERS 
PITCHFORD HALL AND TREEHOUSE HAVE HAD A HISTORY OF ECCENTRIC OWNERS NONE MORE SO THAN LADY SYBIL GRANT 
RESIDENT IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY 
REPUTEDLY LADY SYBIL HAD A FEAR OF RUNNING WATER AND AS A RESULT SHE VACATED THE LUXURY OF PITCHFORD HALL 
TO TAKE UP RESIDENCE NEAR HER BELOVED TREEHOUSE 
SHE WAS ENORMOUSLY FAT HAD BRIGHT RED HENNAED HAIR 
WASN'T VERY NICE TO HER HUSBAND 
SO SHE'D BE UP IN THE TREE WAVING HER TWO FLAGS 
AND HE'D BE AT THE OTHER END SORT OF RETURNING IT 
LADY SYBIL ON FINE DAYS SHE WOULD TAKE TEA IN THE TREEHOUSE 
AND THE POOR BUTLER USED TO STAGGER ACROSS THE LAWN AND UP THE BANK 
WITH THE SILVER SALVERS BEARING SANDWICHES AND GOODIES TO EAT AND DRINK 
WHILE SHE SAT PERCHED ON TOP OF THE TREE IN THE HOUSE 
HOW SHE MANAGED TO WADDLE UP I'VE NO IDEA 
THE TRADITION OF TAKING TEA THERE GOES BACK BEFORE LADY SYBIL GRANT 
WHEN YOUNG PRINCESS VICTORIA VISITED PITCHFORD PRIOR TO HER CORONATION HER DIARY OF ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY THREE RECORDS A VISIT 
TO A LITTLE HOUSE IN A TREE IN ORDER TO TAKE TEA 
THE TREE HAS OBVIOUSLY HAD TO LIVE WITH MAN'S INTERVENTION TO IT 
NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE TREEHOUSE 
I SUPPOSE THERE COMES A POINT WHERE THE TREEHOUSE DEFINES THE TREE 
THE FACT THAT THERE'S A TREEHOUSE THERE MEANS EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROP UP THE TREE 
TODAY THE EXTERIOR OF THE TREEHOUSE MIMICS THE TUDOR STYLE OF PITCHFORD HALL PERFECTLY 
BUT CONFUSINGLY ILLUSTRATIONS FROM THE TURN OF THE CENTURY SHOW THE HOUSE CLAD WITH PLASTER 
SO THE HOUSE IS MEANT TO HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF MASONRY 
IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE A BLACK AND WHITE HOUSE 
IT'S GOT CHARM IT HAS AN ICONIC POWER PEOPLE DON'T FORGET IT 
BUT IT'S A SERIOUS WORK OF ARCHITECTURE AS WELL 
BECAUSE THERE'S NO MUCKING ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE INTERIOR AND THE PURPOSEFULNESS OF THE DESIGN 
IT'S A PERMANENT OBJECT IN A RATHER IMPERMANENT SETTING 
THEY JUST KEPT IT THE RIGHT SIZE THE RIGHT SCALE THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF DETAIL AND INTENSITY OF QUALITY 
FOR IT TO BE A PERFECT LITTLE ARTIFICE 
IT'S A MARRIAGE OF ARTIFICE AND NATURE 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT YOU'VE GOT TO SAY IT HAS A MOTHERLY NATURE 
BECAUSE IT'S EMBRACING THE TREEHOUSE 
CURLING ITS ARMS ROUND IT 
THE TREE AND THE TREEHOUSE TO ME ARE JUST LIKE AN OLD DARBY COUPLE HUSBAND AND WIFE 
IT LOOKS O. K. FOR THE TIME BEING OUR GENERATION WILL TAKE PLEASURE FROM IT 
BUT IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR THE FUTURE 
THIS IS ONE OF THE OLDEST SURVIVING MAPS OF BRITAIN MADE OVER SIX HUNDRED YEARS AGO
