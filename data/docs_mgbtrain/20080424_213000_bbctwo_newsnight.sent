STRIKES IN SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC 
SERVICES TROUBLE WITH M. P.'S IS 
THIS GORDON BROWN'S SPRING TIME OF 
DISCONTENT 
THIS GORDON BROWN'S SPRING TIME OF DISCONTENT 
TONIGHT MORE THAN TWO MILLION 
PUPILS LOSE OUT IN THE FIRST 
TEACHERS' STRIKE IN TWENTY ONE YEARS IN 
THE RUN UP TO GCSES SCHOOLS IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES SAW WALK OUTS 
THERE WERE FURTHER STRIKES IN THE 
PUBLIC SERVICES HOW FAR DO THE 
UNIONS SCENT WEAKNESS IN THE BROWN 
GOVERNMENT NOW EIGHTEEN POINTS ADRIFT IN 
THE OPINION POLLS WE'LL HEAR FROM 
THEM AND A GOVERNMENT MINISTER 
WAS SYRIA TRYING TO BUILD A NUCLEAR 
REACTOR WITH THE HELP OF NORTH 
KOREA AND THAT WHY ISRAEL ATTACKED 
AND ON THE M. P.'S WHO PUT THEIR 
RELATIVES ON THE PAYROLL 
AND WHY DON'T YOU GO TO THE OPERA 
WITH THIS CHANGE OF MIND 
EIGHT THOUSAND SCHOOLS ONE IN THREE IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES WERE DISRUPTED BY 
BY TODAY'S TEACHERS' STRIKES THE 
FIRST IN TWENTY ONE YEARS UP TO TWENTY SIX 
MILLION PUPILS SOME PREPARING FOR 
GCSES AND A LEVELS WERE AFFECTED 
ALL THIS COMES AMID DISCONTENT OF 
SOME OTHER PUBLIC SERVICE WORKERS 
IF YOU WERE GORDON BROWN SURVEYING 
THIS AND THINKING ABOUT THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH AND OTHER PROBLEMS WOULD 
YOU BE HAUNTED BY MEMORIES OF THE 
TROUBLES THAT ULTIMATELY BROUGHT 
DOWN THE CALLAGHAN GOVERNMENT 
WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO WAKE UP ON 
ON THE MORNING AFTER A MAJOR U. TURN 
AND LOCAL ELECTIONS A WEEK AWAY 
WELL DOITS NOT THIS 
TEN THOUSAND TEACHERS CAN GENERATE A LOT 
OF PUNISHMENT AND THIS WAS JUST ON 
THE STREETS OF LONDON ACROSS 
ENGLAND AND WALES THE FIRST BIG 
TEACHERS STRIKE IN TWENTY ONE YEARS CLOSED 
OR PARTIALLY CLOSED ONE SCHOOL IN 
THREE THEY ARE ANGRY ABOUT THEIR 
PAY RISE BUT IT'S WHAT MADE THEM 
ANGRY THAT WILL CAUSE SHUDDERS IN 
THE GOVERNMENT A MA LAYS A 
DISCONNECTION A DISCONTENT 
THESE TWO NEWLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS 
THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS BEING A BIT 
DICKENSIAN WITH THE TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE PER CENT PAY OFFER 
I'M JUST ABOVE TWENTY THOUSAND AT THE 
MOMENT I WORK IN CROYDON I HAVE 
TO PAY HALF OF MY MONTH'S SALARY 
GOES ON MY ACCOMMODATION EVERY 
MONTH IT IS QUITE TOUGH EACH MONTH 
IT IS SCRAPING BY 
IS IT GETTING 
TOUGHER 
IT IS WHY 
BECAUSE THE TOUGHER WHY PRICE OF LIVING IS INCREASING AND 
MY SALARY ISN'T 
FOR THE LABOUR BACKBENCHERS WHO 
HELPED FORCE YESTERDAY'S U. TURN 
OVER THE TEN P. TAX RATE THE TIMING 
OF TODAY'S STRIKES WAS IMMACULATE 
IT'S THE POLICIES THAT ARE THE ROOT 
CAUSE OF PROVOKING PEOPLE INTO 
STRIKE ACTION PEOPLE DON'T GO ON 
STRIKE LIGHTLY TEACHERS DO NOT 
LEAVE THEIR CLASSES LIGHTLY THEY 
ARE PRESSURISED AND FORCED TO IN A 
SENSE OF ANGER BY WHAT THIS 
GOVERNMENT IS DOING UNLESS THE 
GOVERNMENT STARTS LISTENING WE HAVE 
A REAL PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS WHEN WHEN TEACHERS GO ON STRIKE EVEN THE 
BOOING IS GOOD NATURED BUT IT'S 
WHO THEY ARE BOOING THAT IS A 
PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNMENT THE 
PEOPLE ON STRIKE TODAY ARE ACUTELY 
AWARE THAT GORDON BROWN HAS DONE 
ONE U. TURN THIS WEEK AND THEY 
PROFOUNDLY HOPE HE WILL DO ANOTHER 
FEAR OF INFLATION IS DEEP WITHIN 
THE D. INA OF MODERN LABOUR SO 
IT'S NOT LIKELY THEY ARE IN A NO 
WIN SITUATION THE MORE THEY LOSE 
OUT HOLD OUT THE MORE THEY LOSE 
SUPPORT AMONG THE THIS KEY 
CONSTITUENCY CONSTITUENCY MANY PUBLIC SECTOR WORK VERSE 
ALREADY ACCEPTED BELOW INFLATION 
PAY RISES TODAY SAW CO ORDINATED 
STRIKE ACTION NOT JUST BY TEACHERS 
BUT BY COLLEGE LECTURERS AND 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CIVIL SERVANT 
THERE'S NOT 
A SERIOUS ECONOMIST IN THIS COUNTRY 
WHO THINKS PUBLIC SECTOR PAY CAUSES 
INFLATION INFLATION IS CAUSED BY 
ENERGY PRICES BY FOOD PRICES BY 
INTERNATIONAL MARKETS 
WHEN IT 
COMES TO MEASURING INFLATION THE 
GOVERNMENT AND THE TEACHERS ARE 
READING FROM DIFFERENT TEXT BOOKS 
THE RETAIL PRICE INDEX HAS BEEN 
RISING STEADILY OVER THE LAST FEW 
YEARS THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX 
WHICH EXCLUDES COUNCIL TAX AND 
MORTGAGES HAS RISEN TOO BUT 
SLOWER IN JULY TWO THOUSAND SIX GORDON BROWN 
CONSTRUCTED THE HEADS OF PAY REVIEW 
BODIES THAT PAY RHYS RISES OVER TWO PER CENT 
WERE NOT CONSISTENT WITH TARGETS 
THIS IS STRIKE THAT IS NOT 
JUSTIFIED WE HAVE ACCEPTED IN FULL 
THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 
INDEPENDENT PAY REVIEW BODY WHICH 
IS THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET 
A FAIR DEAL AND THEIR PAY KEEPS 
RISING 
WHEN I SPOKE TO SOME RISING TEACHERS THEY DISMISSED THESE 
COMMENTS 
I READ TODAY THAT JIM COMMENTS KNIGHT IS DEWILLEDERED BY THE 
STRIKE ACTIONS L. DON'T UNDERSTAND 
THIS IF YOU GIVE TEACHERS A PAY 
CUT YOU CAN'T BE BEWILDERED IF 
THEY STAND UP FOR THEMSELVES YOU YOU NEVER WIN AGAINST THIS GOVERNMENT 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE RIGID RULES ON 
INFLATION 
THAT'S NOT A REASON NOT INFLATION TO FIGHT THEY HAVE BACKED DOWN 
TWICE ALREADY I DON'T SEE WHY WE 
CAN'T MAKE THEM A THIRD TIME IT IT BEGINS TO CHANGE THE ELECTORAL 
STRATEGY OF THE LABOUR PARTY IT 
WAS PREFPLZ PREMISEED ENTIRELY ON 
WINNING MARGINAL SEATS THROUGH 
SWING VOTERS NOW IT CHANGES WE 
HAVE TO WIN OVER THE CORE 
SUPPORTERS THEY ARE SURVEYING AT 
HOME THEY STILL IDENTIFY WITH THE 
LABOUR PARTY BUT THEY'LL NO LONGER 
VOTE FOR IT BECAUSE OF PUBLIC 
SECTOR PAY COME UP WITH THE RIGHT 
POLICIES I THINK BROWN CAN STILL 
DO IT BUT NOT WERE TIME TO DO IT 
FOR MUCH OF LABOUR'S TIME THERE 
HAS BEEN LOW INFLATION AND 
GENEROUS PAY RISES NOW THERE'S 
INFLATION AND THEY ARE STRAPPED FOR 
CASH GRASMGRASMGRASM HAS SIFTING 
THROUGH THE WRECKAGE 
INTO A 
COMPLEX AND CONFUEFRG PICTURE 
INTEREST ABOUT THE TEN P. TAX RATE 
I'LL ADD A BIT MORE COMPLEXITY THE 
GOVERNMENT GOT RID OF THE TEN P. TAX 
RATE QUITE A FEW M. P.'S WERE NOT 
HAPPY MANY LOW PAID WERE GOING TO 
LOSE OUT AND WOULD PAY MORE TAX 
THE GOVERNMENT DID A BACK ROOM DEAL 
THE M. P.'S WERE OF THE OPINION CAME 
AWAY WITH ANY DEAL COULD BE BACK 
DATED LAST NIGHT ON NEWSNIGHT 
YVETTE COOPER SAT WHERE I AM 
SITTING NOW SHE WOULD NOT BE DRAWN 
IF EVERY GROUP WOULD BE BACK DATED 
AND COMPENSATED 
IT'S ALL BACK 
DATED 
WE SAID WE THINK FOR THE DATED GROUP 
NOT FOR ALL 
WE CAN BECOME GROUP DATE TO TO APRIL 
FOR THE SIXTY TO SIXTY FOUR 
YEAR OLDS AND NO ONE ELSE WE'LL WE'LL ANNOUNCE THE CONSOLUTIONS 
CONCLUSIONS 
FRANK FIELD IS UNDER CONCLUSIONS THE IMPRESSION THIS DEAL COVERED 
EVERYONE AND WAS BACK DATED TO 
APRIL 
WE WILL ANNOUNCE THE APRIL DETAILED PROPOSALS IN THE PREBUDGET 
REPORT 
WHAT DID M. P.'S MAKE OF THAT REPORT TODAY 
AS YOU CAN EMERGENCY TODAY IMAGINE SOME OF THOSE SAID WE ARE 
HAPPY THE GOVERNMENT HAVE GIVEN US 
WHAT WE WANT THOUGHT PERHAPS THEY 
HAVE BEEN SOLD A PUP TODAY IN THE 
COMMONS ALISTAIR DARLING IN 
TREASURY QUESTIONS AND GAVE A FORM 
OF WORDS THAT REASSURED EVERYBODY 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT IF THEY COULD 
MAKE IT HAPPEN WOULD BE 
COMPENSATED AND THAT WOULD BE BACK 
DATED 
PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE DATED REMOVAL OF THE TEN P. BAND ARE 
DISPARITY BECAUSE THEY ARE 
AFFECTED IN A DIFFERENT WAYS IT 
WILL BE NECESSARY FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT TO LOOK AT A RANGE OF 
WAYS TO HELP THEM MY FOCUS IS TO 
ALLOW US TO OFF SET THE AVERAGE 
LOSSES FOR THE ABOLITION OF THEIR 
BAND FOR THIS WEEK YEAR THIS IS 
WHAT I INTEND TO DO 
THIS NEXT WEEK 
AT THIS TIME WE'LL BE TALKING 
ABOUT THE LOCAL ELECTIONS AN 
INTERESTING WEEK 
THIS IS NOT THE 
WEEK OF PREPARATIONS THAT THE 
THAT LABOUR WANTED BAD NEWS FOR 
LABOUR TOMORROW GOOD NEWS FOR 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY SUPPORTERS IF 
THEY PICK UP A COPY OF TOMORROW 
MORNING'S TELEGRAPH A POLL WILL 
PUT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY A FULL 
EIGHTEEN POINTS AHEAD IN THE POLLS THERE 
ARE THE FIGURES FORTY FOUR PER CENT FOR THE 
CONSERVATIVES TWENTY SIX PER CENT FOR LABOUR THE 
LIB DEMS ON SEVENTEEN THAT WOULD PUT THE 
CONSERVATIVES AT A AT A POINT WHERE 
THEY WHERE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN IN THE 
POLLS SINCE MARGARET THATCHER IN 
NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN OTHER POLLS HAVE HAD DONE BY 
DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES AND 
COMPANIES HAVE COME UP WITH 
DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS AN I. C. M. POLL 
IN THE GUARDIAN HAD THE 
CONSERVATIVES FIVE POINTS AHEAD 
THIS IS NOT THE TONIC FOR THE 
TROOPS THAT GORDON BROWN WOULD WANT 
TO SEND THEM A WEEK AWAY FOR LOCAL 
ELECTIONS 
I'M JOINED BY MARK ELECTIONS SERWOTKA OF THE PUBLIC AND SERVICES 
UNION DO YOU NOT READ THE PAPERS 
THERE'S A CREDIT CRUNCH AND PEOPLE 
ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR MORTGAGE 
PAYMENTS AND FUEL BILLS THEY'RE 
FED UP PAYING TOO MUCH IN TAXES 
THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU MORE 
MONEY 
PEOPLE ON STRIKE SHAMEFULLY MONEY TREATED BY THE GOVERNMENT SOME ON 
TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE ON THE D. W. P. 
ADMINISTERING WELFARE TO THE PEOPLE 
IN THE COUNTRY FORTY PER CENT GETTING A ZERO PAY 
INCREASE A QUARTER OF LETTING 
GETTING LESS THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR 
THEY WRITE AND TELL ME I CAN'T 
TAKE A HOLIDAY AND LIE AWAY AT 
NIGHT AND WORRY ABOUT PAYING THE 
BILLS 
YOU KNOW FOR THE PAST TEN OR BILLS ELEVEN YEARS WE HAVE PLOUGHED ENDLESS 
AMOUNTS OF MONEY INTO THE PUBLIC 
SERVICES TEACHERS NINETEEN PER CENT UP IN REAL 
TERMS OF THEIR PAY NINETEEN PER CENT OVER TEN 
YEARS YOU HAVE NEVER HAD IT SO 
GOOD FROM ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT 
HAPPENING IN THE PAST TEN YEARS 
THAT'S BIG PICTURE QUOTE THE 
REALITY THE GOVERNMENT HAS SPENT 
FOUR BILLION YEAR ON CONSULTANTS 
NEVER MIND THAT WHAT IS GOING INTO 
THE PUBLIC SERVICES WHICH THE 
TAXPAYERS OF THIS COUNTRY ARE 
PAYING FOR THERE'S NO APPETITE FOR 
TAX RIES RISES 
IT HAS BEEN 
SQUANDERED FOUR BILLION ON 
CONSULTANTS SOME ON TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND A 
YEAR IN THE CIVIL SERVICE THE 
STATISTICS ARE IN THE FOUR YEARS OF 
THE LAST FIVE WE HAVE HAD LESS THAN 
THE RATE OF INFLATION WHEN PEOPLE 
CAN'T MAKE ENDS MEET AND THEY ARE 
TO SERVE THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY 
TELLING FORTY PER CENT OF WORKERS IN A 
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT GETTING ZERO PER CENT IS 
UNACCEPTABLE 
YOU HEARD THE TEACHER UNACCEPTABLE SAYING THE GOVERNMENT HAS BACKED 
DOWN TWICE THEY WILL BACK AGAIN 
IF YOU KEEP PUSHING GORDON BROWN 
WILL WOBBLE 
THEY SCRATCH THEIR HEAD WHEN THEY 
SAY WHY IT IS A LABOUR GOVERNMENT 
GETTING MORE PRIVATISATION THEN 
MARGARET THATCHER AND THE LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT COMBINED 
YOU WOULD HAVE 
A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE OF DIRECTION 
WITH AN EIGHTEEN PERCENTAGE POINT LEAD 
MY LOYALTY IS TO THE PEOPLE I 
REPRESENT I DON'T WANT TORY 
GOVERNMENT BUT MANY OF THE PEOPLE I 
REPRESENT ONE THE GOVERNMENT TO 
CHANGE DIRECTION WE SAY IN EVERY 
CONSTITUENCY WE WRITE TO ALL OF THE 
CANDIDATES WE ASKED THEM VIEWS WE 
PUBLISH THE 
ANSWERS SEVENTY EIGHT 
OF 
LABOUR CANDIDATES TELL 
US WHEN 
WE ASKED 
THEM THEY 
DO NOT 
WITH THE PRIME I AM ALSO 
JOINED BY 
JIM KNIGHT 
SCHOOLS MINISTER IT 
HAS BEEN 
SCHOOLS MINISTER IT HAS BEEN A ROTTEN 
WEEK FOR 
YOU AND 
THE PARTY 
HASN'T IT IT HAS NOT 
BEEN THE 
HASN'T IT IT HAS NOT BEEN THE EASIEST WEEK 
MINISTER BUT 
WE HAVE 
ALSO SHOWN 
PRIORITIES DURING A 
DIFFICULT WEEK 
WE STARTED IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC 
STABILITY THE STARTING POINT FOR 
ANY GOVERNMENT 
THE HAVE ENDED UP 
GIVING UP TO BACKBENCHERS BECAUSE 
YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT REBELLION WE WE HAD A DISCUSSION WITHIN THE PARTY 
OUR PRIORITY WE ARE UNIFIED AROUND 
AND DEALING WITH THE CHANGES THAT 
WERE MADE TO DEAL WITH THOSE THAT 
HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY SERVED RESPECT OF 
THE FOLLOWING THE TAX 
REDUCING INCOME 
TAX AND 
WE HAVE 
ALSO SEEN 
A PRIORITY 
TO LISTEN 
TO 
ALSO SEEN A PRIORITY TO LISTEN TO PARENTS 
AND CHILDREN 
CONTINUED TO INCREASE RESOURCES ON 
EDUCATION WE 
HAVE HEARD TEACHER 
AFTER TEACHER 
SAYING PEOPLE ARE 
LEAVING THE PROFESSION THAT YOU SAY 
IS A 
TOP PRIORITY 
BECAUSE THEY 
DO 
NOT 
GET PAID 
ENOUGH 
REALITY AND 
I SEE 
THAT 
TEACHING IS 
NOW THE 
NUMBER TWO 
CAREER CHOICE 
FOR GRADUATES LEAVING UNIVERSITY 
IF YOU ARE 
PAYING AN 
EXTRA FOUR PER CENT A 
YEAR AND 
GETTING TOO 
ZERO POINT FOUR FIVE PER CENT 
THAT 
IS 
A REAL TERMS 
PAY 
ARE SIMPLE BUT 
IT DEPENDS 
ON WHICH 
MEASURE OF 
INFLATION 
YOU USE 
WE 
CAN HAVE AN ARGUMENT ABOUT C. P. I. 
AGAINST R. P. I. IT IS NOT A TECHNICAL 
ARGUMENT FOR MOST PEOPLE WATCHING 
THIS ARGUMENT IT IS ABOUT STUFF 
WHICH TEACHERS NEED TO 
GET BY 
AND 
YOU MUST ACCEPT THAT WE HAVE ASKED 
THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW BODY TO LOOK 
AT THAT ALONGSIDE WHAT WAS 
AFFORDABLE FOR EMPLOYERS 
WHO IN 
THE 
END ARE 
SPENDING COUNCIL 
MONEY AND AS 
A RESULT 
OF THE 
EVIDENCE THAT 
ALL 
SIX OF 
THE 
TEACHER UNIONS GAVE 
THEM ALONGSIDE 
TEACHER UNIONS GAVE THEM ALONGSIDE OURSELVES AND THE EMPLOYERS THEY 
CAME UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS THAT 
THREE OUT OF THAT SIX UNIONS 
ACCEPTED 
ARE THEY JUST DAFT OR ACCEPTED BEING DIFFICULT OR WHAT 
I CHARACTERISE ALL 
TEACHERS AS 
DOING 
CHARACTERISE ALL TEACHERS AS DOING A REALLY IMPORTANT JOB THEY ARE 
HELPING TO IMPROVE STANDARDS 
THEY EXCEPT THE 
ONES WHO 
WALKED OUT 
TODAY DESPITE 
THE FACT 
OF THE 
INDEPENDENT PAY REVIEW 
I WOULD TO ONE OF 
THOSE PEOPLE 
THAT 
NEED TO LOOK AT THE FRONT PAGE 
STORY IN THE TIMES SUPPLEMENT 
TOMORROW THEY SHOULD LISTEN TO THE 
PARENTS THEY SAID THINK 
ABOUT THE 
DAMAGED BY LOSING A DAY AND 
RESPECTING THE 
OUTCOME OF AN 
INDEPENDENT PROCESS DO 
YOU THINK 
INDEPENDENT PROCESS DO YOU THINK THAT 
WHAT WE 
HAVE 
HEARD TODAY 
IS 
THAT PEOPLE 
SMELL THE 
BLOOD IN 
THE WATER 
THAT 
IS WHAT 
THE YOUNG TEACHER WAS SUGGESTING 
YOU PUSH 
THEM HARD ENOUGH THEY 
WILL WOBBLE 
THIS GOVERNMENT WILL 
NOT SACRIFICE ECONOMIC STABILITY 
AND INFLATION WE WILL NOT TAKE 
RISKS WITH INFLATION IT IS 
IMPORTANT 
TO HAVE 
A 
CONSISTENT PAY 
POLICY 
SO WE 
CAN KEEP INFLATION 
UNDER CONTROL FRANK 
FIELD AND 
THE 
OTHER 
MEMBERS WHO 
FOLLOWED 
HIM ON 
THE TEN P. 
TAX CUT WERE 
TO REBEL 
ON 
THIS YOU 
WOULD 
BE IN REAL TROUBLE 
AGAIN YOU WOULD 
WOBBLE AGAIN I AM 
AGAIN YOU WOULD WOBBLE AGAIN I AM CONFIDENT THAT 
THE BEDROCK OF OUR 
SUCCESS HAS BEEN 
COMPETENCE WE CANNOT SACRIFICE 
THAT ON THE BASIS OF INFLATIONARY 
WAGE RISES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR 
HE WHEN HE SEES THE PUBLIC OPINION 
POLL ALL OF 
THEM PUT 
YOU 
EIGHTEEN PER CENT YOU WOULD NOT BE IN 
PARLIAMENT 
I HAVE GOT A VERY PARLIAMENT MARGINAL SEAT BUT I HAVE BEEN 
CAMPAIGNING 
IN MY 
MARGINAL 
SEAT AND 
KNOCKING 
ON DOORS 
OVER THE LAST FEW 
WEEKS I 
FIND NO 
FEUD 
RUSH OF 
PEOPLE 
WANTING TO 
VOTE CONSERVATIVE 
I FIND 
A WEARY DISAPPOINTMENT WITH 
ALL POLITICIANS 
MARK SERWOTKA WAS 
JUST TALKING ABOUT LACK OF 
ENTHUSIASM FROM THE CORE SUPPORTERS 
OF 
THE LABOUR 
PARTY 
THEY WILL 
STAY 
HOME NEXT 
WEEK 
I DON'T 
SEE 
THAT ON 
HOME NEXT WEEK THE 
DOORSTEP WE 
WILL WAIT AND 
WHAT HAPPENS 
IN RESPECT 
OF 
LOCAL ELECTIONS 
I THINK 
WE 
EVERYTHING TO 
PLAY FOR 
NEXT 
ON THE BASIS THAT 
THEY 
WANT TO 
BE 
PERSUADED BY 
IT WAS BUT EQUALLY 
THEY ARE 
NOT PERSUADED BY 
ELSE THE UNITED 
STATES HAS 
JUST 
NORTH 
KOREA OF 
HELPING 
SYRIA TO 
BUILD 
A NUCLEAR 
REACTOR CAPABLE OF 
PRODUCING WAQAR AND WEAPONS 
CONTAINING PLUTONIUM BUT SYRIA AND 
NORTH KOREA HAVE DENIED THE 
ALLEGATION ALLEGATION SENIOR OFFICIALS FROM THE 
ADMINISTRATION WENT TO BRIEF 
CONGRESS TODAY WITH WHAT THEY SAID 
WOULD BE COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT 
TO OF 
AMERICA'S LEAST 
FAVOURITE 
COUNTRIES NORTH KOREA AND SYRIA 
WERE CO OPERATING TO SPREAD NUCLEAR 
TECHNOLOGY THE 
ADMINISTRATION SAID 
TECHNOLOGY THE ADMINISTRATION SAID THE 
BRIEFING WAS 
A 
RESPONSE TO 
LEGISLATORS 
AND WANTED 
TO 
ABOUT THE CHARGES 
AGAINST NORTH 
KOREA BUT OTHERS DETECT DIFFERENT 
MOTIVES I 
THINK THAT 
IN 
TERMS OF 
MOTIVES THE NORTH KOREA 
NEGOTIATIONS THIS 
THE NORTH KOREA NEGOTIATIONS THIS IS LIKELY 
TO INCREASE 
DEMANDS FOR 
THE U. S. 
NOT TO ACCEPT A NORTH KOREAN 
DECLARATION ONE 
THAT FAILS 
MENTION THEIR INVOLVEMENT 
MENTION THEIR INVOLVEMENT WITH SYRIA IF 
THAT HAPPENED 
THIS IS 
LIKELY TO 
BE 
LIKELY TO BE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE FROM 
THE POINT 
OF 
VIEW OF 
THE 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH 
NORTH KOREA 
SENSE IS 
THE U. S. 
HAS 
REACHED A 
DECISION THAT 
IT 
WANTS TO 
PUT MORE 
PRESSURE 
ON SYRIA 
THE C. I. A. 
SHARE

AGO ALTHOUGH 
SYRIA 
MONTHS AGO ALTHOUGH SYRIA TODAY REPEATED DENIALS IT HAS DONE

THERE WERE NO

SYRIANS SAID 
THEY HAD

ANY BOMBS BEING 
DROPPED BUT IN OCTOBER OF PRESIDENT 
BASHAR AL ASSAD TOLD THE THEY 
BOMBED THE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION 
IT IS NOT USED IT IS UNDER 
CONSTRUCTION SO THERE IS NO PEOPLE 
IN IT WE DON'T 
KNOW THE 
REASON IT 
WAS 
NOT CLEAR 
BUT FOR ROZ IT 
REFLECTS THE FUNDAMENTAL AND 
VISCERAL ANTI PATH OF THE ISRAELIS 
TOWARDS PEACE 
AS INTERNATIONAL 
SPECULATION GREW SCIENTISTS LOOK AT SATELLITE DID IMAGES OF AN 
AREA THAT 
HAD 
BEEN FLATTENED 
BY JANUARY 
THIS 
NOTING 
THAT AN 
ALMOST 
BUILDING HAD SPRUNG 
UP AGAIN 
AND 
THAT PIPES WERE BEING MADE 
TO A 
NEW 
CONSTRUCTION FROM 
A NEARBY 
TREATMENT PLANT 
WHAT NONE 
OF THESE 
IMAGES 
COULD DO 
WAS SHOW 
WHAT WAS 
GOING 
ON INSIDE 
THE BUILDING 
ANSWER WHETHER 
SYRIA WAS 
REALLY 
PURSUING THE MILITARY NUCLEAR ROUTE 
IF IT 
TURNS 
OUT THAT 
THIS IS 
NUCLEAR REACTOR 
THE PRESUMPTION 
WOULD HAVE 
TO 
BE THAT 
IT WAS 
MILITARY NUCLEAR 
PROGRAMME THAT 
WOULD NOT 
BE 
PROVED BUT 
IT WOULD 
MEAN IT 
BE 
MY PRESUMPTION 
IS 
BELIEVED TO BE 
AGHAST GRAPHITE 
REACTOR AND 
THESE ARE 
REACTORS THAT 
ARE PARTICULARLY SUITABLE FOR 
WEAPONS GRADE 
PLUTONIUM SECONDLY 
WEAPONS GRADE PLUTONIUM SECONDLY THE 
SYRIANS WOULD 
BE 
UNDER A 
LEGAL 
OBLIGATION TO 
DECLARE A 
REACTOR AT 
OBLIGATION TO DECLARE A REACTOR AT A MUCH EARLIER STAGE 
TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC 
ENERGY AGENCY 
INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY THIS FAILURE TO ABIDE BY 
INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT AND THE 
REACTOR BEING SUITABLE FOR WEAPONS 
USED 
WOULD MEAN 
STRONG 
PRESUMPTION THIS 
WAS 
STRONG PRESUMPTION THIS WAS A MILITARY 
AMERICAN OFFICIALS 
ARGUE 
THE NEW 
IMAGES 
SHOW A REACTOR SUSPICIOUSLY 
SIMILAR TO 
THIS ONE NORTH KOREA'S 
SIMILAR TO THIS ONE NORTH KOREA'S PLANT THE NEW ALLEGATIONS MADE 
WILL COMPLICATE DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA WHICH 
HAS PROMISED 
TO SUSPEND 
ITS NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS PROGRAMME 
AND SYRIA 
WHICH 
STILL INSISTS 
IT DOES NOT 
HAVE WON 
I AM 
JOINED BY 
DOCTOR SAMI KHIYAMI 
SYRIAN AMBASSADOR AND BY JED 
BABBIN 
FORMER U. S. 
AMBASSADOR UNDER 
BABBIN FORMER U. S. AMBASSADOR UNDER SECRETARY OF NUCLEAR REACTOR OF COURSE NOT 
CERTAINLY NOT 
BUT I 
THINK THAT 
SYRIA HAS 
REALISED VERY EARLY IN 
THE GAME UP THAT IT IS NOT THE ROAD 
TO PEACE 
WE HAVE HEARD THE WHITE HOUSE 
SAYING THIS COULD HAVE PRODUCED 
PLUTONIUM IT WAS NOT FOR PEACEFUL 
PURPOSES IT WAS WEEKS PERHAPS 
MONTHS AWAY FROM OPERATION AND 
THERE ARE LOTS OF PICTURES WHICH 
WILL BE RELEASED AFTER ELEVEN P. M. ALL OF 
THIS SUGGESTS THAT THEY HAVE 
SOMETHING ON YOU AND THE ISRAELIS 
BOMBED NUCLEAR REACTOR 
IT IS 
FANTASTIC BECAUSE IT REMINDS US 
TREMENDOUSLY OF THE FAMOUS 
ALLEGATIONS OF WMD AGAINST IRAQ L. 
AM SURE THAT THE C. I. A. REPORTS ARE 
COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS BECAUSE IT 
SEEMS THAT THE NEW YORK TIMES HAS 
DISCOVERED YOU LEARN FROM THE NEW 
YORK TIMES THAT NOT ONLY THIS 
PLACE WAS NOT A NUCLEAR REACTOR 
BUT ALSO IT HAS BEEN DESERTED FOR 
MANY YEARS IN THE SENSE THAT THERE 
ARE KUGEL PHOTOS THAT HAVE SHOWN 
THE SAME LOCATION ABOUT THREE YEARS 
AGO AND THEN IT SHOULD IT WHEN IT 
WAS BOMBED AND IT WAS EXACTLY THE 
SAME IN THE SAME CONDITION AS IT 
WAS THREE YEARS AGO 
LET'S HEAR 
FROM JED BABBIN IN WASHINGTON L. 
TAKE IT YOU HAVE HEARD THAT IT IS 
RIDICULOUS AND THE C. A. A. REPORT IS 
NOT TRUE 
WELL WE CAN HEAR THAT 
AS LONG AS HE WANTS TO SAY THAT IF 
THIS WERE AN INNOCENT OPERATION 
THE SYRIANS WOULD NOT HAVE CLEANED 
UP THE EVIDENCE IMMEDIATELY THIS 
IS NOT EVEN ABOUT SYRIA SYRIA IS 
ALMOST IRRELEVANT BECAUSE IT IS 
COMPREHENSIVELY VULNERABLE THE 
SYRIANS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE ISRAELI 
AND AMERICAN AIR FORCE CAN DO 
ANYTHING THEY WANT TO ANY TIME 
OVER SYRIA THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER 
THE NORTH KOREANS ARE ABIDING BY 
THE SIX PARTY TALKS AND THIS IS 
PROOF THAT THEY ARE NOT 
YOU HAVE 
HEARD THE AMBASSADOR SAY THAT IT 
WAS NOT HAPPENING IT WAS NOT WHAT 
YOU SAID IT WAS SO THERE WAS NO 
NORTH KOREAN INVOLVEMENT AND YOU 
GOT IT WRONG ABOUT IRAQ AS WELL I I AM SURE BUT COMING FROM THE 
REPRESENTATIVE OF A STATE SPONSOR 
OF TERRORISM QUITE FRANKLY WITH 
RESPECT TO THE AMBASSADOR I WOULD 
NOT BELIEVE HIM IF HE TOLD ME THE 
TIME OF DAY AND IT AGREED WITH A REGIME 
WHICH IS ANYTHING OTHER THAN AN 
OUTLAW REGIME IT CANNOT BE 
RESPECTED IN GLOBAL DEBATE AND IS 
NOT SOMETHING THAT FITS IN IN THE 
GLOBAL CALCULATION AGAIN THIS IS 
NOT WITHIN SYRIA THIS IS ABOUT 
NORTH KOREA AND THE APPARENT 
FAILURE OF THE SIX PARTY TALKS 
AMBASSADOR IS THERE NORTH KOREAN 
CONNEXION IN SYRIA 
NO I THINK 
NORTH KOREA IS MORE TARGETED THAN 
SYRIA IN THIS BECAUSE THE AMERICAN 
ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO SHOW THE 
AMERICAN PUBLIC BEFORE THE 
ELECTIONS THAT IT HAS FORBIDDEN 
NORTH KOREA FROM SO CALLED 
PROLIFERATION OF SO CALLED NUCLEAR 
ARMS TALKING ABOUT THE LIES AND 
CALUMNIES I THINK IF THE AMERICAN 
ADMINISTRATION SPENDS THE LAST 
EIGHT MONTHS JUST APOLOGISING TO 
PEOPLE FOR ALL OF THE HARM THAT HAS 
GONE TO THE WORLD ACROSS THE 
CALUMNIES IT HAS SPREAD AROUND 
THEY WILL NOT HAVE TIME TO DO THAT 
I AM NOT SURE JED BABBIN WOULD 
AGREE 
ALL THAT I CAN SAY IS THAT AGREE THE LIES AND CALUMNIES DO NOT 
INCLUDE MY STATEMENT THAT SYRIA IS 
A STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM THEY 
ARE SPONSORING HEZBOLLAH THEY ARE 
SPONSORING THE IRAQ LINES OF 
SUICIDE BOMBERS COMING INTO IRAQ 
THESE PEOPLE CANNOT BE TRUSTED AND 
AGAIN WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT SYRIA 
SYRIA IS NOT A POWER AND CAN BE 
DEALT WITH ANY TIME THIS IS ABOUT 
NORTH KOREA AND THE REAL PLAYERS ON 
THE WORLD STAGE 
WOULD THERE BE ANY 
OBJECTION TO NEWSNIGHT GOING TO SEE 
WHAT WAS BOMBED BY THE ISRAELIS I I THINK MANY REPORTERS WENT AND HAD A 
LOOK THOUGHT SO THE PROBLEM IS NOT 
THERE IN FACT I THINK THE WHOLE 
MIDDLE EAST SYRIA WAS THE ONE WHO 
HAS PROPOSED ALL THE TIME THAT THE 
WHOLE MIDDLE EAST SHOULD BE FREE OF 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND I 
THINK THAT REPORTERS SHOULD GO TO 
THE ISRAELI REACTOR FIRST AND ALL 
THE INSTALLATIONS IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST SYRIA WOULD BE MORE THAN 
HAPPY 
JUST A FINAL THOUGHT WHY DO HAPPY YOU THINK THIS HAS COME OUT TODAY 
IT WAS BOMBED IN SEPTEMBER WHY ARE 
WE HEARING ABOUT IT NOW 
THAT IS A 
PUZZLE TO ME AND I HAVE NOT HAD A 
DECENT ANSWER FROM ANY OF MY 
SOURCES IN THE WHITE HOUSE L. 
INTEND TO PRESS THE POINT IT IS 
NOT EXACTLY A SLOW NEWS DAY 
COMING UP 
NUDITY STEAMY SCENES OR A BIT OF 
PUNCH AND JUDY WITH ANY OF THAT 
MAKE YOU GO TO THE OPERA 
FIRST A ROUND UP OF THE NEWS 
NEARLY ONE THIRD OF SCHOOLS IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES HAVE BEEN 
DISRUPTED AND ONE IN TEN CLOSED 
COMPLETELY DURING THE BIGGEST 
TEACHERS' STRIKE IN TWENTY ONE YEARS THE 
SCHOOLS MINISTER TOLD US THE 
GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT BE PUSHED 
AROUND 
THIS GOVERNMENT WILL NOT AROUND SACRIFICE ECONOMIC STABILITY AND 
INFLATION WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE 
RISKS WITH INFLATION IT IS 
IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A CONSISTENT 
PAY POLICY 
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED M. P.'S HAVE FOR THE 
FIRST TIME PUBLICLY DECLARED THAT 
THEY EMPLOY MEMBERS OF THEIR 
FAMILIES THEY HAVE LISTED THE 
RELATIVES IN THE REGISTER OF 
MEMBERS' INTERESTS WHICH HAS BEEN 
PUBLISHED FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 
THE EXPENSES SCANDAL INVOLVING THE 
M. P. DEREK CONWAY THERE IS NO RULE 
AGAINST M. P.'S USING RELATIVES AS 
STAFF WHAT HAVE 
WE LEARNED TODAY TODAY WE GOT ONE HUNDRED SIX M. P.'S WHO HAVE DECLARED 
THEY EMPLOY MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILY 
THIS IS A VOLUNTARY DECLARATION 
THEY HAVE UNTIL THE FIRST AUGUST 
AFTER WHICH IT BECOMES A COMPULSORY 
DECLARATION THE INTERESTING THING 
IS WHO HAS CHOSEN TO MAKE A 
DECLARATION SO FAR AND WHO HAS NOT 
AMONG THE COMMISSION'S IS THE 
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE MICHAEL 
MARTIN WHO IS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN 
EMPLOYING HIS DAUGHTER AS A 
CONSTITUENCY CASEWORKER HE HAS NOT 
DECLARED THAT AMONG THE 
EMISSIONS SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING 
THAT HE IS OVERSEEING THE REVIEW OF 
THE FORM OF EXPENSES IN THE COMMONS 
AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO 
DECLARE REALLY IT IS WORRYING 
THAT 
HE HAS 
NOT DONE SO OTHERS WHO 
HAVE NOT DECLARED OUR MARGARET 
BECKETT AND SIR MING CAMPBELL BOTH 
OF WHOM HAVE EMPLOYED THEIR SPOUSES 
IN THE PAST AT THE MOMENT THEY DO 
NOT HAVE TO DECLARE IT IT IS 
PURELY VOLUNTARY ON THE OTHER HAND 
WE HAVE THE ROBINSON FAMILY FROM 
NORTHERN IRELAND PETER ROBINSON 
NEWLY ELECTED LEADER OF THE DUP AND 
HIS WIFE IRIS WHO WAS ALSO A 
WESTMINSTER M. P. BETWEEN THEM THEY 
EMPLOY FOUR MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILY 
PETER ROBINSON EMPLOYS ONE OF THEIR 
SONS AND A DAUGHTER IN LAW AND 
IRIS ROBINSON EMPLOYS ANOTHER SON 
AND A DAUGHTER SO THERE ARE SIX 
ROBINSON'S ON THE WESTMINSTER PAY 
ROLL COMBINING TODAY'S LIST WITH 
THE LIST THAT NEWSNIGHT COMPILED OF 
ABOUT NINETY SIX NAMES WE NOW KNOW ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO M. P.'S 
WHO EMPLOY MEMBERS OF THEIR 
FAMILIES IT COULD GO TO AROUND TWO HUNDRED 
I THINK YOU CAN SEE IT ON OUR 
WEBSITE 
INTERESTING BUT DOES IT WEBSITE MATTER 
YES BECAUSE OF THE CONWAY MATTER CASE THAT YOU MENTION WHERE DEREK 
CONWAY WAS FORCED TO PAY MONEY BACK 
AND WAS SUSPENDED FOR TWO WEEKS 
BECAUSE HE WAS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN 
EMPLOYING TWO OF HIS SONS WITHOUT 
MUCH EVIDENCE THEY WERE DOING ANY 
WORK AND THERE HAVE BEEN STORIES 
OF ABUSE FOR YEARS PEOPLE 
EMPLOYING PEOPLE WITHOUT THEM DOING 
MUCH WORK THE THEORY IS THAT BY 
MAKING THEM DECLARE THIS ON THE 
REGISTER TRANSPARENCY THAT WILL 
DETER PEOPLE FROM ABUSING THE 
SYSTEM IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO 
SEE WHAT HAPPENS ONCE IT BECOMES 
COMPULSORY WELL VARIOUS RELATIVES 
GET SACKED THERE IS SOME SUSPICION 
YOU MAY GET WIFE SWAPPING 
ARRANGEMENTS WHEREBY M. P.'S SAY I 
WILL EMPLOY YOUR WIFE AND YOU 
EMPLOY MINE 
A HOME VIDEO OF LONDON SUICIDE 
BOMBER MOHAMMAD SIDIQUE KHAN 
BIDDING GOODBYE TO HIS DAUGHTER HAS 
BEEN SHOWN TO A JURY AT KINGSTON 
CROWN COURT IT WAS SHOWN IN THE 
PROSECUTION OF THREE MEN ARE 
ALLEGED TO HAVE HELP FIND BOMBING 
TARGETS IN THE CAPITAL 
THE MARKETS 
NOW EVERY FEW YEARS THE OPERA 
WORLD GOES IN SEARCH OF THE HOLY 
GRAIL NEW YOUNGER AUDIENCE IT 
USUALLY ENDS IN A CRY TO DO 
SOMETHING RADICAL THIS TIME IT IS 
THE ENGLISH NATIONAL OPERA LEADING 
THE CHARGE IT SAYS OPERA IS NOT AS 
INTENSE RELEVANT OR POLITICAL AS 
THE MOVIES OR THEATRE IF YOU ARE 
UPSET BY THE ODD SWEAR WORD OR 
NUDITY PERHAPS THIS REPORT IS NOT 
FOR YOU 
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH OPERA IS 
THAT WE ARE STUCK IN THIS MODE OF 
DOING IT IN GIANT OPERA HOUSES 
WITH A CERTAIN KIND OF ARCHITECTURE 
AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE BY 
DEFINITION WE THINK OF OPERA AS 
TAKE OUT THE BINOCULARS AND LOOK 
FROM A DISTANCE 
EVEN AS LATE AS A YEAR AGO I WENT 
TO THE TEMPEST AT THE ROYAL OPERA 
HOUSE AND AFTER FIFTEEN MINUTES I WAS 
OUT THE DOOR 
IF YOU LOOK AT A 
THEATRE AND FILM AND IF YOU LOOK 
AT SOME OF THE FILM MAKERS ON 
TELEVISION THE OPERA WORLD CAN 
FEEL SLIGHTLY PRECIOUS 
EVERY TEN 
YEARS OR SO BRITISH OPERA BEATS 
ITSELF UP DEPRESSED THAT ITS 
AUDIENCE IS SMALLER THAN FOR ANY 
OTHER ART FORM AND 
DISPROPORTIONATELY GREY HEAD IN 
THE NINETIES THE OBSESSION WAS WITH 
BRINGING DOWN TICKET PRICES NOW IT 
IS WITH MAKING OPERA MORE DARING 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLITICAL FILMS 
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE OF THE LAST TEN 
YEARS THAT HAVE HAD HUGE AUDIENCES 
IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE BIG 
POLITICAL STATEMENTS IN THEATRE 
THROUGH PRODUCTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN 
MADE AND I DO THINK AND FEW 
PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE THAT OPERA IS 
LAGGING BEHIND 
THERE WAS A PERIOD 
AROUND THE TURN OF THE MILLENNIUM 
WHEN IT WAS PERCEIVED THAT OPERA IN 
GENERAL WAS QUITE THREATENED 
POLITICALLY BECAUSE IT WAS 
PERCEIVED AS BEING ELITIST AND 
RATHER NARROW IN ITS SOCIAL APPEAL 
OPERA COMPANIES HAD TO WATCH THEIR 
STEP AND THEY WERE NOT LIKELY TO 
BE FUNDED TO DO WHATEVER THEY 
WANTED AND THE IDEA OF THEM DOING 
SOMETHING THAT WAS RADICAL AND 
SHOCKING WAS THEREFORE FROWNED 
UPON 
IN THE QUARTET THINK UP A UPON LITTLE MORE 
THAT IS NO KIND OF 
PLAYS FOR DANIEL KRAMER PREVIOUSLY 
THE DIRECTOR OF A VERSION OF HAIR 
THE MUSICAL THAT LOOKED AT THE WAR 
IN IRAQ INSTEAD OF VIETNAM BUT 
NOW ENGLISH NATIONAL OPERA HAS GOT 
HIM DIRECTING THE NOTORIOUSLY 
DIFFICULT HARRISON BIRTWISTLE PIECE 
PUNCH AND JUDY 
AS LATE AS 
SEPTEMBER I WAS SAYING I DON'T 
KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT I HATE IT 
AROUND SEPTEMBER I HAD A 
BREAKTHROUGH I HAD LISTENED TO THE 
POLICE SO MANY TIMES IN ANGER AND 
FRUSTRATION TO THE PEACE L. 
STARTED TO REALISE THAT I HAD TO 
CARVE OUT A STORY WITHIN IT THAT I 
AND AN AUDIENCE COULD UNDERSTAND 
ANOTHER TOOL IN THE ACCESSIBILITY 
KIT IS STAGING PUNCH AND JUDY IN 
THE ROUND AND AT THE YOUNG VIC 
THEATRE IN SOUTH LONDON INSTEAD OF 
THE ENO'S USUAL VAST COLISEUM STAGE 
THE CONTENTION IS THAT OPERA IN 
THIS COUNTRY CAN OFTEN BE JUST NOT 
DRAMATIC ENOUGH THE SPACE CAN BE 
TOO BIG THE PERFORMANCE TOO STATIC 
SO THE OBVIOUS SOLUTION IS TO 
SHRINK THE SPACE AND UP THE ACTION 
THEN THERE IS THE IDEA OF PUTTING 
ON AN OPERATIC ADAPTATION OF DAVID 
LYNCH'S FILM LOST HIGHWAY 
THE SAME SMALL SPACE AT THE YOUNG 
VIC IS TURNED INTO SURREAL 
EVOCATION OF THE FILM TO SCORE 
BY AN AUSTRIAN COMPOSER ACTORS 
CLIMB IN AND OUT OF A GLASS CUBE 
SURROUNDED BY VIDEO SCREENS SHOWING 
IMAGES INSPIRED BY THE FILM OPERA OPERA AS AN ART FORM HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN 
IT WAS COINED IN THE EARLY SIXTEEN 
HUNDREDS THAT IS FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AS 
OPPOSED TO THEATRE WHICH HAS BEEN 
AROUND THOUSANDS OF YEARS WE ARE 
AT THE BEGINNING OF UNDERSTANDING 
WHAT THIS FORM OF MUSIC THEATRE CAN 
BE WHICH WE CALLED OPERA FOR ME 
THE BEST OPERA IS THE MOST FAULT 
EMBODIED A MUSICAL DRAMATIC 
EMOTIONAL THEATRE 
THE ENO YOUNG VIC EXPERIMENT HAS 
BEEN DEEMED CRITICAL SUCCESS BUT 
A COMMITMENT TO RADICAL PRODUCTIONS 
HAS ITS DANGERS GADDAFI FAIRLY 
RECENT PIECE AT THE COLISEUM WAS 
UNIVERSALLY PANNED BUT PHILIP 
GLASS'S POLITICAL OPERA ABOUT 
GANDHI SATYAGRAHA WAS FETED AND 
PULLED IN A NEW CROWD 
IF WE HAD 
SEVENTY EIGHT PER CENT FIRST TIME ATTENDEES TO ENGLISH 
NATIONAL OPERA THAT IS A HUGE 
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE NEVER 
SET FOOT IN THIS INSTITUTION AND I 
AM SURE MANY OF THOSE HAD NEVER 
BEEN TO AN OPERA BEFORE 
BUT WILL 
THE SAME PEOPLE MAKE THE MOVE FROM 
PHILIP GLASS OR LOST HIGHWAY TO 
MORE TRADITIONAL WORKS 
I THINK THE 
IDEA OF DOING THAT PEACE WAS VERY 
SENSIBLE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF 
ATTRACTING THE DINGE AUDIENCE 
ATTRACTING THE DAVID LYNCH AUDIENCE 
TO A MUSIC THEATRE PIECE THEY 
MIGHT FIND THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE 
SUFFICIENTLY DAVID LYNCH LIKE TO 
COME BACK AND SEE SOMETHING ELSE 
MY CONCERN IS WHETHER THE AUDIENCE 
WILL CROSSOVER TO MOZART OR TO 
VERDI 
THE OPERA WORLD KNOWS THAT IS THE 
REALLY HARD BIT WHICH IS WHY THE 
ROYAL OPERA HOUSE AS WELL AS DOING 
MORE CHALLENGING PRODUCTIONS IS 
PUTTING FILM OPERA IN CINEMAS ENO 
HAS ITS FAITH IN THE INTERNET 
GROOMING CYBER COMMUNITIES OF OPERA 
VIRGINS FOR THE HARD CORE 
REPERTOIRE AND THERE IS A DRIVE TO 
GETTING MORE OUTSIDER DIRECTORS 
LIKE DANIEL KRAMER 
I WOULD LOVE TO 
HAVE DIERK BJORK L. WOULD 
LOVE TO HAVE THAT ON THE STAGE L. WOULD LOVE M. T. V. LIGHTING 
AND BLUE SCREENS AND GREEN SCREENS AND TECHNOLOGY 
TO DESIGN PRODUCTION OF OPERA SO 
IT WAS REALLY SOMETHING TO COMPETE 
WITH SOME OF THE THINGS NOT THAT 
WE SEE IN FILM I DON'T THINK WE 
SHOULD COMPETE WITH FILM BUT WITH 
THE TOP THEATRICALITY IN THE WORLD 
WHICH IS WHAT OPERA USED TO DO 
AS WE WERE SAYING A FEW MOMENTS AGO 
THE UNITED STATES HAS JUST EXCUSE 
NORTH KOREA OF HELPING SYRIA TO 
BUILD A NUCLEAR REACTOR CAPABLE OF 
PRODUCING WEAPONS GRADE PLUTONIUM 
WASHINGTON SAYS THE REACTOR WAS 
DESTROYED IN AN ISRAELI AIR RAID 
LAST YEAR SYRIA AND NORTH KOREA 
DENIED THE ALLEGATION MARK URBAN 
IS WITH ME FOR THE LATEST WHILE WHILE THOSE OPERA STARS WERE DISROBING 
THE C. I. A. WAS UNCOVERING SECRETS A 
SECRET VIDEO PREPARED FOR BRIEFING 
PURPOSES AND SHOWN IN CONGRESS 
EARLIER TODAY IN THE PAST FEW 
MINUTES THE EMBARGO HAS BEEN 
LIFTED ON THAT MATERIAL THIS IS 
THE FUEL ROD AND ASSEMBLY AS 
DESCRIBED BY THE C. I. A. BEING 
COMPARED TO THE ONE AT THE REACTOR 
IN NORTH KOREA ARE OBVIOUSLY 
TRYING TO POINT OUT THE 
SIMILARITIES AS THEY SEE IT OF THE 
ARRANGEMENT BUT SOME OTHER 
INTERESTING IMAGES THAT SEEM TO 
SUGGEST THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN 
TAKING STEP BY STEP PHOTOS THIS 
IS THE CONCRETE REINFORCED REACTOR 
CONTAINER ANOTHER GROUND LEVEL 
PICTURE OF THE WALL OF THE BUILDING 
THE ISRAELIS DESTROYED ALL THESE 
IMAGES SUGGEST THAT SOMEONE 
INVOLVED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF 
THIS HAS BEEN TAKING PHOTOS WHICH 
SOMEHOW WERE OBTAINED WORD ON THE 
STREET IS THAT ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE 
OBTAINED THESE IMAGES WE DO NOT 
KNOW HOW WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER IT 
WAS A MASTER SPY OR WHETHER THEY 
WERE INTERCEPTED BUT OTHER 
INTELLIGENCE IMAGERS A PHOTO 
ACCORDING TO THE C. A. A. OF THE HEAD OF 
THE NORTH KOREAN REACTOR PROGRAMME 
WITH THE HEAD OF THE SYRIAN ATOMIC 
ENERGY COMMISSION THE SEA ISA 
ALL EVIDENCE SAY THE UNITED STATES 
OF THIS REACTOR WHICH THEY SAY WAS 
NEARING COMMISSIONING IN AUGUST 
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND WHICH THEY SAY IS AN 
EXAMPLE OF NORTH KOREA SUPPLYING 
NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY TO SYRIA THAT THAT IS THE INTERESTING POINT LISTENING 
TO OUR AMERICAN INTERVIEWEE EARLIER 
HE SAID THIS IS ABOUT NORTH KOREA 
NOT SYRIA 
THAT IS WHAT THE 
ADMINISTRATION SAID WAS THE REASON 
FOR GIVING THIS PRESENTATION TODAY 
IT IS FASCINATING AND PEOPLE WILL 
BE WARY AFTER THE IRAQ WMD 
INTELLIGENCE BUT I HAVE TO SAY 
THIS IS QUITE UNLIKE MOST OF THE 
MATERIAL WE SAW IN THE RUN UP TO 
THE INVASION OF IRAQ 
LET'S HAVE A 
LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS 
THE FINANCIAL TIMES ON THE RIGHT 
HAND SIDE HAS A STORY ABOUT NORTH 
KOREA HELPING SYRIA BUILD A NUCLEAR 
REACTOR REACTOR THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AS A STORY 
ABOUT PRISONS BEING SO CUSHY THAT 
INMATES REFUSE TO ESCAPE 
THE EXPRESS SAYS DRUGS ARE SO CHEAP 
IN JAIL THAT INMATES SMUGGLE THEM 
OUT TO SELL 
THAT IS ALL FROM NEWSNIGHT TONIGHT 
WE ARE BACK TOMORROW AT THE SAME 
TIME WITH A REVIEW AT ELEVEN P. M. 
GOOD NIGHT WITH REVIEW 
HELLO THERE IT IS A BIT CARELESS 
I KNOW BUT WE ARE LOSING THEIR 
HEAVY SHOWERS AT THE MOMENT WE ARE 
GOING TO BE LOSING THE SUNSHINE FOR 
TOMORROW AS THE CLOUD INCREASES 
SOME EARLY BRIGHTNESS FOR EASTERN 
PARTS BUT GENERALLY CLOUDING OVER 
SOME RAIN PARTICULARLY FOR 
NORTHERN IRELAND IN THE MORNING 
SPREADING NORTH AND EAST IN THE 
AFTERNOON ACROSS NORTHERN ENGLAND 
THINGS WILL GO DOWNHILL ALSO 
LIGHT AND PATCHY RAIN MOVING EAST 
THROUGH THE MIDLANDS TOWARDS THE 
WASH THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND 
MIGHT STAY DRY VERY LITTLE RAIN 
AROUND THE SOUTH EAST WILL SEE THE 
HIGHEST TEMPERATURES SEVENTEEN CELSIUS 
SIXTY THREE FAHRENHEIT THE SOUTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND QUITE CLOUDY FOR MOST OF 
THE DAY THE NORTH COAST MAY 
IMPROVE THROUGH THE AFTERNOON BUT 
DAMP WEATHER CONTINUING ACROSS THE 
WESTERN SIDE OF WALES MOST OF THE 
RAIN MOVING NORTH THROUGH NORTHERN 
IRELAND IN THE AFTERNOON MOVING 
NORTH INTO SCOTLAND SOME OF THAT 
COULD BE HEAVY OVER THE WESTERN 
HILLS SOME RAIN IN EDINBURGH ON 
FRIDAY BUT MANY NORTHERN PARTS OF 
THE U. K. WILL SEE RAIN ON SATURDAY 
FROM STORRIE FURTHER SOUTH 
INCREASING CLOUD ON FRIDAY A 
DIFFERENT STORY IT COULD TURN VERY 
WARM ON SATURDAY MANY PARTS WILL 
BE FINE AND DRY RAIN MAINLY FOR 
SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND WILL 
BRING THE TEMPERATURES DOWN THAT 
WILL HEAD SOUTH TO 
YOUR TOWN 
YOUR TOWN 
YOUR STREET 
YOUR HOME 
IT'S ALL IN OUR DATABASE 
NEW TECHNOLOGY MEANS IT'S EASY TO PAY YOUR T. V. LICENCE 
AND IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE IF YOU DON'T
