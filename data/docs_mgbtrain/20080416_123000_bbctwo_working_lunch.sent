GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME TO 
WEDNESDAY'S WORKING LUNCH I'M NIK 
WOOD HIGHER LIVING COSTS ECONOMIC 
UNCERTAINTY WE'RE TIGHTENING OUR 
BELTS BUT IT'S NOT ALL DOOM AND 
GLOOM I'LL BE TELLING YOU HOW TO 
FIND A LITTLE BIT OF SAVING 
SUNSHINE 
RELEGATION ON THE HIGH SUNSHINE STREET AS JJB SPORTS HANG UP ITS 
BOOTS AT SEVENTY TWO STORES FOLLOWING A BIG 
FALL IN PROFITS WE'VE HEARD OF 
MONEY BEING TAKEN OUT OF YOUR 
ACCOUNT WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION 
WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU DO IF YOU 
RECEIVE MONEY 
THEY SAID THAT 
SOMEBODY OF MY NAME HAD RUNG UP AND 
ASKED TO HAVE THEIR PENSION PUT 
INTO THE CHESHIRE BUILDING SOCIETY 
THEY HAD OBVIOUSLY PUT IT INTO MY 
CHELSEA BUILDING SOCIETY 
AND THIS HUGE TIMBER PILE BEHIND ME 
IS THE RAW MATERIALS FOR A BRAND 
NEW NINETY MILLION POWER PLANT HERE ON 
THE SCOTTISH BORDERS ITS OWNERS 
SAY IT'S GREEN AND IT'S EFFICIENT 
HOW ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY IS IT 
REALLY REALLY INTEREST RATES ARE GOING DOWN 
MORTGAGE RATES ARE RISING PERSONAL 
DEBT IN THE U. K. NOW STANDS AT ONE POINT FOUR 
TRILLION WHAT STARTED OUT AS 
STORM IN THE CITY IS NOW FINALLY 
RAINING ON OUR SPENDING PARADE U. K. 
CONSUMERS SAY THE CREDIT CRUNCH IS 
SQUEEZING THE FUN OUT OF THEIR 
FINANCES AS WE SLIM DOWN OUR 
SPENDING IN A BID TO COPE WITH THE 
RISING COSTS RACHEL REPORTS 
INTEREST FREE CREDIT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY PER CENT 
MORTGAGES AND THE URGE TO SPEND 
SPEND SPEND IT WAS FUN WHILE IT 
LASTED BUT A DECADE OF DECK DENSE 
HAS COME TO AN END 
THE CREDIT HANGOVER HAS KICKED IN 
AND IT'S PROVING PAINFUL MORE THAN 
HALF OF U. K. ADULTS SAY THEY'VE HAD 
TO CANCEL SPENDING PLANS BECAUSE 
THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR CASH 
ONE IN FIVE SAY THEY WILL DELAY 
FAMILY HOLIDAY SIXTEEN PER CENT ARE PUTTING 
HOME IMPROVEMENTS ON HOLD ONE IN 
NINE SAY THEY'LL NO LONGER BE 
PUTTING MONEY INTO SAVINGS WE WE DEFINITELY SAY THAT PEOPLE FEEL 
WORSE OFF AT THIS TIME THAN A LAST 
YEAR IT'S A COMBINATION OF 
FACTORS UTILITY FACTORS HAVE BEEN 
ON THE RISE THE WEEKLY SHOPPING 
BILL IS INCREASING THEY'RE HAVING 
TO PAY MORE TO SERVICE THEIR 
MORTGAGE WHEN YOU OFFSET THIS 
AGAINST THEIR SAVINGS EARNING THEM 
LESS INTEREST IT'S A POORER 
SITUATION PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES IN 
THERE IS CONCERN AND PEOPLE ARE 
FALLING MORE CAUTIOUS 
IT'S LOOKING 
LIKE A PRETTY MISERABLE STORM FOR 
MANY OF US TO WEATHER 
RACHEL TO ME HOLIDAYS ARE A BIT 
LIKE CHRISTMAS YOU AFFORD THEM 
YOU MAKE IT HAPPEN YOU'RE SAYING A 
FIFTH OF US ARE THINKING OF CUTTING 
BACK OR CANCELLING 
THAT DATA HAS 
COME FROM MINTEL THEY SURVEYED 
TWO THOUSAND ADULTS AND ASKED THEM HOW 
THEIR SPENDING HABITS HAD CHANGED 
OVER THE LAST YEAR YES ONE IN 
FIVE TWENTY PER CENT SAY THEY'RE RETHINKING 
THEIR HOLIDAY PLANS IT DOESN'T 
NECESSARILY MEAN THEY'RE GOING TO 
CANCEL THEM BUT THEY MAY CHANGE 
THEIR MINDS IN TERMS OF DESTINATION 
OR IN TERMS OF THE TYPE OR EXPENSE 
OF THE HOLIDAY THEY'LL TAKE 
EARLIER WE SPOKE TO ABTA TO FIND 
OUT WHAT IMPACT OUR MONEY WORRIES 
ARE HAVING ON THEIR MEMBERS WE'VE WE'VE SEEN IF ANYTHING A SLIGHT 
INCREASE IN BUSINESS THIS YEAR WE 
THINK THE MAIN REASON IS THE FACT 
THAT LAST YEAR WE HAD NO SUMMER IN 
THE U. K. AND PEOPLE WHO LEFT IT LATE 
TO BOOK FOUND THERE WAS LITTLE 
AVAILABLE SO THEY'RE NOT PREPARED 
TO RISK THAT AGAIN BUT WE HAVE 
SEEN PEOPLE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT 
GOING FOR SLIGHTLY LOWER STANDARD 
HOLIDAYS LET'S SAY A THREE STAR 
INSTEAD OF A FOUR STAR HOTEL WHICH 
MEANS IF YOU'RE PREPARED TO UPGRADE 
YOU'LL GET A BETTER DEAL THIS YEAR 
IF YOU'LL DO THAT BECAUSE THERE 
WILL BE LESS DEMAND AND THAT 
RESULTS IN LOWER PRICES 
STAY WITH US BECAUSE ABTA SAY 
THERE WE'RE STILL GOING ON HOLIDAY 
JUST CHOOSING CHEAPER ONES BUT WITH 
KURPBLY RATES FALLING IF 
CURRENCY RATES FALLING IF PEOPLE GO 
ABROAD THEY WON'T BE GETTING AS 
MUCH AS THEY USED TO 
ADAM ADAM IT'S NOT LOOKING THAT GOOD IF 
YOU'RE HOLIDAYING IN THE EURO ZONE 
A YEAR AGO YOU WOULD 
YOU'RE HOLIDAYING IN THE EURO ZONE A YEAR AGO YOU WOULD 
GET ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR EUROS 
FOR EACH POUND 
WE CAN SHOW YOU THIS GRAPH AND IT 
SHOWS YOU WHAT'S HAPPENING SORRY 
THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT GRAPHICS 
OVER THE PAST YEAR THE EURO HAS 
RISEN IN VALUE AGAINST THE POUND 
THE TYPICAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUREAU 
WILL GIVE YOU ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN EUROS FOR EACH 
POUND THAT MAKES BUYING ANYTHING 
ABROAD MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT DECLINE OVER 
THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS APRIL TO APRIL 
A THIRTEEN PER CENT DECLINE LET'S LOOK AT WHAT 
YOU WOULD GET FROM ONE OF THE MAJOR 
PROVIDERS THOMAS COOK IN THIS CASE 
BUT FAIRLY STANDARD I HOPE AGAINST 
THE EURO PERHAPS NOT WELL DONE ME 
BECAUSE I MEMORISED THEM ALL 
AGAINST THE U. S. DOLLAR ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT GETTING TWO TO THE 
POUND AT ONE STAGE WITH WILL OFF 
THAT LEVEL NOW 
PARTICULARLY NOT GOOD NEWS I THINK 
IF YOU'RE GOING OFF TO THE EUROZONE 
THANKS ADAM 
RACHEL IF WE'RE IN THAT POSITION 
WHERE WE'RE NOT PREPARED TO GIVE UP 
ON THAT HOLIDAY WHAT IS THE ADVICE 
ON GETTING THE BEST OUT OF YOUR 
HOLIDAY AND SPENDING YOUR MONEY IN 
THE WISEST WAY 
SAY YOU'VE BOOKED 
YOUR FLIGHTS YOUR CONCERN IS YOUR 
SPENDING MONEY AND WE'RE NOT 
GETTING AS MUCH FOR OUR POUND AS WE 
WERE THIS TIME LAST YEAR YOU NEED 
TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU'LL ACCESS 
YOUR SPENDING MONEY ABROAD THE 
CHEAPEST WAY IS TO BRING THE RIGHT 
BIT OF PLASTIC WITH YOU IF YOU'RE 
GOING TO BRING A CREDIT CARD MOST 
CREDIT CARDS WILL CHARGE YOU A 
LOADING FEE OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT AND A 
WITHDRAWAL FEE WE FOUND TWO CREDIT 
CARDS THAT DON'T CHARGE YOU THE 
LOADING FEE THEY CHARGE YOU THE 
CASH WITHDRAWAL FEE 
WE HAVE THE POST OFFICE MASS TARRED 
CARD AND NATIONWIDE VISA WILL 
CHARGE YOU THREE IF YOU WANT TO BRING 
A DEBIT CARD AND THIS IS THE 
CHEAPEST WAY TO ACCESS SPENDING 
MONEY ABROAD IT'S WITH THE 
NATIONWIDE FLEX ACCOUNT WE'VE 
COVERED THIS SUBJECT SO MANY TIMES 
AND CONSISTENTLY THIS CARD HAS COME 
OUT AS ONE OF THE CHEAPEST WAYS TO 
ACCESS MONEY ABROAD 
THERE'S NO LOADING FEE YOU'RE NOT 
CHARGED INTEREST ON THE MONEY YOU 
TAKE OUT THERE'S NO CHARGE FOR 
YOUR CASH WITHDRAWAL IF YOU WANT 
TO HAVE CASH IN YOUR WALLET WHEN 
YOU LAND THEN THINK ABOUT IT 
BEFORE YOU GET TO THE AIRPORT YOU 
LEAVE FROM BECAUSE YOU'RE NEVER 
GOING TO GET A GOOD RATE IN YOUR 
AIRPORT IN THE U. K. YOU NEED TO PLAN 
AHEAD IF YOU WERE TO GO DOWN THERE 
WITH ONE HUNDRED IN CASH AND YOU WANT 
EUROS IF YOU WENT TO THOMAS 
EXCHANGE GLOBAL YOU'D GET ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO EUROS 
YOU'VE CONVINCED ME TO DO WHAT I 
WANTED TO DO WHICH WAS TO BOOK THE 
HOLIDAY AND GO ON IT IN THE BUILD 
UP TO USING THAT PLASTIC HOW DO I 
SAVE MOST WISELY TO MAKE SURE I CAN 
AVOID AFFORD THE BEER AND THE 
COCKTAILS ON HOLIDAY 
THAT'S A GOOD 
QUESTION BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE 
TIGHTENING THEIR BELTS THEY MAY 
NOT HAVE THAT SURPLUS LEFT AT THE 
END OF THE MONTH THEY CAN SPEND ON 
HOLIDAY THEY WANT TO SAVE UP IN 
ADVANCE EARLIER I ASKED PAUL 
DAVIES FROM WHICH FOR SOME 
PRACTICAL MONEY SAVING TIPS 
DAVIES FROM WHICH FOR SOME PRACTICAL MONEY SAVING TIPS 
WE'D 
WE'D SAY THEY CAN LOOK AT THE UTILITY 
COSTS SWITCH TO A CHEAPER UTILITY 
PROVIDER THEY CAN ASSESS THEIR 
EXISTING DEBTS THEY SHOULD PAY OFF 
ANY OVERDRAFTS ANY CREDIT CARD 
BALANCES THEY HAVE OR MAYBE SWITCH 
TO ANOTHER CREDIT CARD THAT HAS A 
LOWER A. P. R. IF YOU CAN SWITCH TO 
BETTER DEALS THAT'S A GOOD MOVE 
PEOPLE SHOULD LOOK AT THEIR SAVINGS 
THEY SHOULD HAVE THEIR SAVINGS IN 
THE BEST ACCOUNT POSSIBLE THEY 
SHOULD DO SOME RESEARCH SWITCH TO 
AN ACCOUNT THAT MAYBE PAYS PER CENT AT THE 
MOMENT AND THEY SHOULD USE THEIR 
ISA ALLOWANCES WHICH HAVE GONE UP 
FROM THREE THOUSAND A YEAR TO THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED 
THEY'RE TAX FREE SAVINGS THAT THAT MIGHT SOUND LIKE OBVIOUS ADVICE 
MAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING THE BEST 
RATE ON YOUR SAVINGS ACCOUNT BUT 
FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVEN'T TAKEN 
THE TIME TO SIT DOWN AND SHOP 
AROUND FOR THE BEST DEAL A FEW 
HOURS' INVESTMENT COULD MAKE A HUGE 
DIFFERENCE TO OUR FINANCES ON THAT 
NOTE WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT ELSE WE 
DO WE'RE KEEN TO HEAR FROM YOU 
OUR VIEWERS ABOUT HOW YOU'RE 
COPING WITH THE CREDIT CRUNCH DO 
YOU HAVE ANY TIPS ARE YOU MANAGING 
TO SAVE SOME MONEY OFF YOUR BILLS 
WHETHER HEATING OR FOOD HOW HAVE 
YOU MANAGED TO GET AROUND THE 
TIGHTENING OF THE MORTGAGE MARKET 
OR HAVE YOU BEEN THROUGH SOMETHING 
SIMILAR IN THE PAST AND HAVE SOME 
SEASONED ADVICE ON HOW TO COPE WHEN 
YOU'RE STRAPPED FOR CASH MAYBE 
YOU'RE RUNNING A BUSINESS WHICH IS 
DOING WELL IN THIS CLIMATE WELL 
GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR STORIES 
GO TO OUR WEBSITE FOR THE WAYS TO 
CONTACT US 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH RACHEL LET'S 
HEAR ABOUT THE REST OF THE BUSINESS 
NEWS UNEMPLOYMENT WAS DOWN BY 
THIRTY NINE THOUSAND TO ONE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE MILLION IN THE THREE 
MONTHS TO THE END OF FEBRUARY 
ACCORDING TO THE OFFICE FOR 
NATIONAL STATISTICS 
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE CLAIMING 
JOBSEEKER'S ALLOWANCE IN MARCH FELL 
BY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED 
THAT'S THE FUES CLAIMING THOSE 
BENEFITS SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE 
ONE IN TEN ADULTS SAY THEY HAVE AN 
ELDERLY PARENT LIVING WITH THEM 
WHILE NEARLY ONE IN FIVE SAY THEY 
STILL HAVE GREN UP CHILDREN IN THE 
NEST ACCORDING TO THE PRUDENTIAL 
AROUND EIGHTY THOUSAND HOMES HAVE THREE 
GENERATIONS UNDER ONE ROOF DUE TO 
THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL PRESSURES 
IT PREDICTS THE NUMBER OF HOMES 
LIKE THIS WILL INCREASE BECAUSE OF 
LOWER RETIREMENT INCOMES FOR OLDER 
PEOPLE AND HIGH HOUSE PRICES 
HITTING THE YOUNGER FAMILY MEMBERS 
WE'LL BE TALKING MORE ABOUT SAVING 
FOR OLD AGE IN A MOMENTSTAY TUNED 
EASYJET BROKE ADVERTISING RULES BY 
RAISING FARES AFTER PROMISING A TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
DISCOUNT ON ALL ITS ROUTES SOME 
PASSENGERS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE 
EASTER DEAL WOULD HAVE PAID MORE 
FOR A SEAT THAN BEFORE IT WAS 
INTRODUCED SAYS THE ADVERTISING 
STANDARDS AUTHORITY EASYJET 
MEANWHILE SAYS ALL CUSTOMERS WHO 
BOUGHT TICKETS DURING THE PROMOTION 
HAD THEIR PRICE DISCOUNTED THE 
COST SIX AN APPLE IPHONE IS TO BE CUT 
BY ONE HUNDRED NEXT MONTH IT'S A CUT OF A 
THIRD ON THE GADGET'S ORIGINAL 
SELLING PRICE WITHIN MONTHS OF IT 
GOING ON SALE HOWEVER THIS IS FOR 
THE OLDER MODEL AND A NEW VERSION 
WILL COST YOU THREE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE CARPHONE 
WAREHOUSE WHICH SELLS THE IPHONE 
SAYS IT WILL REIMBURSE ANYONE WHO 
BOUGHT ONE OF THE DISCOUNTED PHONES 
WITHIN THE LAST THIRTY DAYS 
YOU'VE BEEN WRITING TO US AGAIN WE 
ALWAYS WELCOME YOUR COMMENTS AND 
QUESTIONS AND STEPHEN LAWRENCE 
WROTE IN TO SAY WHAT WOULD THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH AND TIGHTER MORTGAGE 
CONDITIONS IT GOT TO MY MIND 
THINKING ABOUT WHERE THE MONEY WE 
USE COMES FROM AND WHERE DOES IT 
ALL GO ADAM 
TELL US 
I'D LOVE TO KNOW ALSO 
I DON'T KNOW 
WHERE THE MONEY GOES EITHER NOTES 
AND COINS FAMOUSLY ARE ISSUED BY 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND BUT ALSO IN 
SCOTLAND THEY CAN BE ISSUED BY THE 
BANK OF SCOTLAND THE CLYDESDALE 
BANK IN NORTHERN IRELAND THEY CAN 
BE ISSUED BY THE BANK OF IRELAND 
FIRST TRUST BANK AND NORTHERN BANK 
ALL THOSE CAN LEGALLY ISSUE 
CURRENCY THE MOST COMMON NOTE 
AROUND THE U. K. IS THE TWENTY THERE 
ARE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION OF THEM IN 
CIRCULATION THE LEAST COMMON AND 
WE'VE HAD COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS IN 
THE PAST IS THE FIVE STILL A LOT 
AROUND AROUND AS TO WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE A 
NUMBER OF THINGS CAN HAPPEN LAST 
YEAR THE BANK OF ENGLAND RECEIVED 
CLAIMS WORTH NINETY TWO THOUSAND FOR NOTES 
WHICH HAD BEEN YES EATEN OR 
CHEWED AMAZINGLY THAT'S FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT 
NOTES PERHAPS WITH THE COST OF 
FOOD GOING UP PEOPLE FIND IT 
CHEAPER TO EAT MONEY DESPITE TALK 
OF A CREDIT CRUNCH AND MONEY IS IN 
SHORT SUPPLY WHAT THEY MEAN BY 
THAT IT MEANS INSTITUTIONS ARE 
UNWILLING TO LEND MONEY MONEY 
ITSELF ACTUAL CASH IS NOT IN 
SHORT SUPPLY NOT BY A LONG SHOT 
IN DECEMBER LAST YEAR THERE WERE 
FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR MILLION WORTH OF NOTES AND 
COINS IN CIRCULATION THERE IS NOW 
FIFTY BILLION QUID IN CIRCULATION 
MONEY SUPPLY IS RISING DESPITE ALL 
THAT TALK IN THE EIGHTIES WE USED TO 
TALK ABOUT MONEY SUPPLY A LOT BUT 
YOU HARDLY HEAR IT MENTIONED NOW 
WHY DO WE NOT TALK ABOUT IT AND HOW 
IMPORTANT IS IT HERE IS THE 
THOUGHTS OF THE B. B. C.'S ECONOMICS 
EDITOR EDITOR BACK IN THE EIGHTIES WE WERE OBSESSED 
WITH MONEY SUPPLY BECAUSE LOT OF 
ECONOMISTS DECIDED YOU COULD 
CONTROL INFLATION BY CONTROLLING 
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE ECONOMY 
WHEN THEY TRIED IT IN PRACTICE 
EVERY TIME THEY PICKED A MEASURE OF 
MONEY IT SEEMED TO GO OUT OF 
CONTROL AND DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY 
RELATION TO INFLATION THEY KEPT 
TRYING TRYING NEW MEASURES AND IT 
NEVER REALLY WORKED OVER TIME THEY 
GAVE UP THESE MEASURES AND WE ALL 
STOPPED TALKING ABOUT THEM IT'S 
INTERESTING FROM AN ECONOMICS 
STANDPOINT IT DOES STILL MATTER 
MONEY DOES IN THE END STILL AFFECT 
INFLATION IN THE LONG RUN IT'S 
UNFORTUNATE FOR POLICY MAKERS THAT 
THEY CAN'T DO MUCH ABOUT IT IN THE 
LONG TERM THEY CAN LOOK AT THE 
FIGURES AND SEE WHEN THE MONEY 
SUPPLY IS INCREASING AND TAKE NOTE 
OF IT BUT THEY CAN'T DO MUCH TO 
STOP IT IN THE SHORT TERMON 
TO THE 
MARKETS THEMSELVES JJB SPORTS SAYS 
IT WILL SHUT SEVENTY TWO STORES BY THE END 
OF THE MONTH AS IT LOOKS TO RECOVER 
FROM A SHARP DROP IN PROFITS IT'S 
ALSO TRYING TO OFFSET ITS RELIANCE 
ON REPLICA KITS BY INCREASING THE 
PROPORTION OF ITS OWN BRAND 
PRODUCTS PRODUCTS IT WILL INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF 
DELIVERIES TO STORES INTRODUCE THE 
STORE STAFF INCENTIVE SCHEME AND 
IT'S OPENED A TRAINING ACADEMY IN 
WIGAN THE COMPANY HAS OVER FOUR HUNDRED 
OUTLETS IT HAS COMMITTED TO 
OPENING MORE COMBINED FITNESS CLUBS 
AND SPORTS STORES IT'S A FORMAT 
THAT HAS PROVED SUCCESSFUL FOR THEM 
THE CHANGES ARE BEING OVERSEEN BY 
THE NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE THE 
FOUNDER A GUY CALLED DAVID WHELAN 
LEFT THE BUSINESS SOLD HIS FAMILY 
HOLDINGS TO A JOINT VENTURE RUN BY 
EXISTA AN ICELANDIC COMPANY 
THEY'VE JUST ANNOUNCED THEIR 
PROFITS PROFITS A TWENTY FIVE MILLION HIT WHICH RELATES TO 
THE COST OF CLOSING THE STORES 
MEANT HEADLINE PROFITS FELL SEVENTY TWO PER CENT 
THERE'S BEEN A SHARP FALL IN THE 
SHARE PRICE 
BACK IN APRIL THESE SHARES WOULD 
HAVE COST 
NOW THE MORE WIDELY HELD SHARES IT 
LOOKS LIKE A GOOD DAY THE F. T. S. E. HAS 
BEEN UP ALL MORNING ONE COMPANY 
YOU WANT TO LOOK AT WHEN THINKING 
OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH ONE COMPANY 
IS A CREDIT AGENCY EXPERIAN THE 
WORLD'S LARGEST IT REPORTED A SLOW 
DOWN IN SALES BUT THEY WERE BETTER 
THAN EXPECTED ANYONE WHO APPLIES 
FOR A CREDIT CARD IS CHECKED WITH A 
MAJOR AGENCY THIS SUGGESTS THERE 
IS STILL SOME CONFIDENCE IN THE 
MARKET AND THE SHARES ARE GOING ALL 
GUNS TODAY EXPERIAN UP EIGHTY SIX PER CENT ONE 
THING I WANTED TO MENTION 
MANGANESE BRONZE HOLDINGS PRE TAX 
AT FOUR POINT NINE MILLION COMPARED WITH THREE SEVEN 
FIVE MILLION THEY CHANGED THE WAY 
THEIR YEAR END WORKS BUT THEIR 
SHARES ARE DOWN AND THEY WILL OPEN 
A MANUFACTURING PLANT IN SHANGHAI 
AS PART OF A TWENTY MILLION CHINESE 
JOINT VENTURE THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED IS UP 
SIXTY SIX POINTS ALL THE MAJOR MARKETS 
ARE UP AND WE ARE MOVING TO THAT 
SIX THOUSAND MARK A NEW POWER STATION IN 
THE SCOTTISH BORDERS HAS BEEN 
HAILED AS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO 
GREENER ENERGY THE STEPHENS CROFT 
ENERGIS FUELLED BY BIO M. A. S. IT IS 
SEEN AS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PROJECT 
THAT THE NATIONAL HOTRY PAID EIGHTEEN 
MILLION TO THE COST BUT JUST HOW 
GREEN IS IT ALONGSIDE THE MOTORWAY 
STANDS ONE OF THE U. K.'S NEWEST AND 
MOST AMBITIOUS POWER STATIONS 
BUILT BY THE COMPANY EON STEPHENS 
CROFT OUTSIDE LOCKERBIE IS THE 
LARGEST PURPOSE BUILT BIOMASS 
STATION IN THE COUNTRY NEXT DOOR 
TO THE STATION A TIMBER COMPANY 
PROVIDES THE RECALL MATERIAL THE 
LOGS ARE CUT INTO WOODCHIPS TO BURN 
WE STORE IT IN THIS BUFFER STORE 
LOGS ARE CUT INTO WOODCHIPS TO BURN WE STORE IT IN THIS BUFFER STORE 
TAKE THAT ALONG HERE AND FEED IT 
INTO THE BOILER TO PRODUCE STEAM T. 
STEAM IS THEN TRANSPORTED THROUGH 
TO THE STEAM TURBINE TO GENERATE 
THE ELECTRICITY AND IT IS TURNED 
BACK INTO WATER AND PASSED BACK 
INTO THE BOILER 
ONE OF THE THINGS 
ABOUT THIS IS HOW FEW PEOPLE THERE 
ARE HERE FORTY PEOPLE WORK ON THE 
SITE BUT WITH SHIFT PATTERNS AT 
ANY TIME THERE IS ONLY TEN PEOPLE 
IN THE WHOLE PLACE LOOM LOOK 
IN 
HERE WE HAVE THE TURBINE THAT 
PRODUCES ENOUGH POWER FOR SEVENTY THOUSAND 
HOMES BUT APART FROM A FEW ROUTINE 
CHECKS THE BUILDING IS DESERTED IT 
IS A FORTY FIVE MEGAWATT STATION BUT THAT 
IS SMALL COMPARED TO COAL FIRED 
ONES BUT COAL BURNING POWER 
STATIONS LIKE THIS ALSO OWNED BY 
E. ON PUMP ABOUT SIX MILLION TONNES OF 
GREENHOUSE GASES INTO THE 
ATMOSPHERE EACH YEAR THE FUEL 
BURNT HERE IS EIGHTY PER CENT TIMBER AND TWENTY PER CENT 
RECYCLED FIBRE BUT CROPS GROWN FOR 
THE POWER STATION WILL BE ADDED TO 
THE MIX THAT IS WHAT THE COMPANY 
SAYS GIVES IT ITS GREEN CREDENTIALS 
NEAR THE PLANT THESE WILLOWS ARE 
GROWING TO PROVIDE THE RAW MATERIAL 
BUT OPPONENTS WOULD SAY THAT IS ONE 
OF THE PROBLEMS THIS IS 
AGRICULTURAL LAND THAT COULD BE 
USED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FOOD AND 
PERHAPS RAISING CATTLE LET'S CHAT 
WITH JONATHAN SMITH THAT IS A 
PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU ARE WASTING 
LAND TO PRODUCE THIS 
AROUND ZERO PER CENT OF 
WOOD WE ARE GOING TO USE COMES FROM 
FARMLAND THE REST IS FORESTRY 
PRODUCT AND THAT IS WHY WE BUILD 
THE POWER STATION HERE THIS IS ONE 
OF THE MOST HEAVILY FORESTED AREAS 
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS YOU ARE 
STILL BURNING AND PRODUCING CARBON 
WHETHER IT IS KEEL OR WOOD WELL WELL BIOMASS IS A CARBON NEUTRAL FUEL 
THE PLANTS ONLY RELEASE THE CARBON 
DIOXIDE THEY TOOK IN DURING THEIR 
LIFE THE NEXT GENERATION OF PLANT 
TAKES IN THAT CARBON DIOXIDE AGAIN 
SO THEORETICALLY THERE IS NO EXTRA 
RELEASED STKPWHRI DON'T UNDERSTAND 
THIS CONCEPT YOU COULD SAY 
COAL IS CARBON NEUTRAL IT WAS 
TREES ONCE WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE 
IT TAKES SIXTY MILLION YEARS TO GET A 
NEW STOCK OF COAL HERE IT TAKES A 
FEW MORE YEARS TO GET MORE TREES 
IT IS A SHORTER CYCLE AND THAT 
MEANS THAT WE CAN DISPLACE A 
GENERATION FROM OTHER SOURCES FROM 
FOSSIL FUELS 
THANK YOU WELL THESE 
TREES SHOULD BE READY FOR USE THE 
WITHIN A YEAR IF THE PLANT IS A 
SUCCESS THE COMPANY PLANS TO BUILD 
MORE IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU WE 
GET E. MAILS ABOUT MONEY BEING TAKEN 
FROM YOUR BANK ACCOUNT BUT WHAT 
ABOUT MONEY BEING PAID INTO YOUR 
ACCOUNT IN ERROR JENNY HAS BEEN TO 
VISIT A COUPLE WHO FOUND 
THEMSELVESS IN THAT POSITION MEET 
BERYL AND HER HUSBAND TERRY IN 
THE LAST FEW MONTHS THEY HAVE BEEN 
BEEN THE BENEFACTORS OF PAYMENTS I I HAD A STATEMENT FROM THE CHELSEA 
BUILDING SOCIETY SAYING THAT TEN 
WAS PAID INTO MY ACCOUNT ON TWENTY FIRST 
DECEMBER THAT WAS NEAR CHRISTMAS 
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT THEN 
THEN WE WENT AWAY FOR CHRISTMAS AND 
THE NEW YEAR AND WHEN I CAME BACK I 
FOUND THAT TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN HAD BEEN PAID IN I I THOUGHT IT WAS SOME INTEREST 
PAYMENT BUT REMEMBERING WHAT I 
HAVE HAD AS A PENSIONER AND WHAT 
SHE HAS HAD GOING IN IT LOOKED AS 
IF IT MIGHT BE A TEN CHRISTMAS 
BONUS FOR PENSIONERS A SIMILAR 
PAYMENT THAT BERYL GETS EACH FOUR 
WEEKS AS A LADY WHO HAS NOT PAID 
HER FULL STAMP 
SHE CONTACTED HER 
BUILDING SOCIETY AND TOLD THEM WHAT 
WAS HAPPENING THEY SAID THE MONEY 
WAS COMING FROM THE PENSION SERVICE 
AND IT WAS INTENDED FOR SOMEONE 
CALLED BERYL SIT COT SILL COT 
THE MONEY KEPT COMING 
CALLED BERYL SIT COT SILL COT THE MONEY KEPT COMING 
IN A LETTER 
THE BUILDING SOCIETY SAID 
SO BERYL CONTACTED THE PECKS 
ERPENSION SERVICE IN A LETSER THEY 
EXPLAINED THERE WAS AN 
ADMINISTRATIVE ERROR WHEN SOMEBODY 
WITH A SIMILAR NAME ASKED FOR THEIR 
PAYMENTS TO BE MADE NOT TO THE 
CHELSEA BUILDING SOCIETY BUT THE 
CHESHIRE BUILDING SOCIETY 
WE GOT A 
RESPONSE TWO OR THREE WEEKS LATER 
THEY WERE JUST INSISTING THAT WE 
GAVE THEM AUTHORITY TO WITHDRAW THE 
OVERPAID SUMS FROM THE BUILDING 
SOCIETY ACCOUNT BUT AT THAT STAGE 
WE HADN'T ACTUALLY RECEIVED OR THE 
ACCOUNT HADN'T RECEIVED ALL THE SUM 
THE TOAL VALUE THEY QUOTED SO WE 
DEFERRED ACTUALLY DOING THAT AND WE 
DID WRITE BACK AND SAY THAT WE 
DIDN'T TRUST THEM TO WITHDRAW THE 
MONEY AS THEDS GOT OTHER THINGS 
WRONG.THEY HAD GOT OTHER THINGS 
WRONG L. SUSPECT THEY WOULD NOT 
HAVE FOUND OUT UNLESS WE TOLD THEM 
BUT WE ARE HONEST PEOPLE WE WE RECEIVED THAT OVER SIX HUNDRED WHICH IS 
NOT OBVIOUSLY TO WHICH YOU NOT 
INTIETLDZ YOU WILL NOTIFY SOMEBODY 
AND TELL THEM THEY HAVE DONE ITS 
WRONG ENTITLED 
THE DEPARTMENT OF 
WORK AND PENSIONS HAS APOLOGISED 
BUT WOULD NOT COMMENT ON THE 
SPECIFICS OF THE CASE THEY HAVE A 
COMPENSATION SCHEME AVAILABLE BUT 
WON'T SAY IF BERYL WILL BE ENTITLED 
THE CHELSEA BUILDING SOCIETY HAS 
GIVEN HER FIFTEEN FOR EXPENSES WHAT 
CAN YOU DO YOU RECEIVE UNWANTED 
PAYMENT FIRSTLY YOU SHOULD CHECK 
YOUR PAYMENT STATEMENTS SECONDSLY 
CONTACT YOUR BANK IMMEDIATELY 
IMPORTANTLY DON'T SPEND THE MONEY 
IF IT IS GENUINERY NOT E. 
GENUINELY NOT YOURS YOU COULD BE 
ASKED TO REPAY IT YOU DON'T HAVE 
LEGAL RIGHT UNLESS ITS WAS INTENDED 
FOR YOU FRPLTS HOWEVER UNDER THE 
LIMITATION ACT IF NO AMENDMENT IS 
MADE TO CLAIM THE MONEY AFTER SIX 
YEARS ITS IS YOURS 
CUE YOU 
TOM IN BELFAST SAYS 
WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE IMPACT OF 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH ON YOUR SAVINGS 
NOW BUT WHAT ABOUT THE FUTURE WHEN 
YOU GET OLDER AS THE SONG SAYS BY 
TWO THOUSAND TEN THERE WILL BE MORE PENSIONERS 
IN THE U. K. THAN CHILDREN THAT WILL 
CAUSE SERIOUS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS A 
NEW ORGANISATION HAS BEEN LAUNCHED 
TODAY TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN PAY FOR 
OUR AGEING POPULATION IT'S CALLED 
THE LIFE TRUST FOUNDATION AND 
JOINING US IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
OF HELP THE AGED AND ONE OF THE 
FOUNDERS OF THAT FOUNDATION 
WHAT IS THE FOUNDATION IS IT 
OFFERING PRODUCTS 
THE COMPANY WAS 
SET UP BY THE LIFE TRUST INSURANCE 
COMPANY WHICH PROVIDES THE PRODUCTS 
THEY TOOK THE VIEW THAT THEY NEEDED 
TO HAVE MUCH MORE INFORMATION ABOUT 
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE MARKET 
THE PUBLIC NEEDED TO THOUGH MORE 
ABOUT LONGEVITY AND THE IMPACTS 
THEY PUT SOME MONEY INTO THE 
FOUNDATION AND THE FOUNDATION IS 
INDEPENDENT FROM THE COMPANY BUT 
IT IS WORKING WITH THE SAME 
INTERESTS 
IN YOUR VIEW AND THE INTERESTS FOUNDATION'S VIEW WHAT ARE THE 
CHALLENGES FACING US THAT YOU ARE 
TRYING TO HELP US WITH 
WELL THE 
ACTUARYS ARE SELL TELLING US 
EXCITING THINGS WE CAN LOOK 
FORWARD TO MANY YEARS BUT THE FACT 
IS THAT THIS MESSAGE IS NOT GETTING 
HOME TO INDIVIDUALS PEOPLE ARE NOT 
UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE GOING 
TO HAVE TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME 
AFTER WHAT WE WOULD REGARD AS 
NORMAL RETIREMENT AND THEIR INCOME 
WILL HAVE TO LAST THEM FOR A LONGER 
THAN THEY EXPECTED SOMETIMES THEY 
HAVE HAVE TO PAY FOR LONG TERM CARE 
THE REALITY IS TA THE STATE PENSION 
WILL NOT GIVE THEM THE LIFESTYLE 
THAT THEY WOULD EXPECT THIS 
PRODUCT IS ONE OF WHAT I WOULD 
REGARD AS A DEVELOPING WALL OF 
PRODUCTS WHICH WE HOPE ARE GOING TO 
GIVE PEOPLE BETTER OPTIONS THERE THERE WAS A STAGGERING FIGURE IF YOU 
BREAK FIFTY TWO YEARS OLD WHICH I AM I 
MAY STAND A CHANCE OF MAKING IT TO 
NINETY BUT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE 
DISILLUSIONED ABOUT PENSIONS HOW 
WILL WE PERSUADE PEOPLE TO BE 
SENSIBLE 
I THINK ANOTHER STATISTIC SENSIBLE WHICH IS MORE EXTRAORDINARY IN MANY 
WAYS SOMETHING LIKE SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT OF FORTY FIVE TO 
SIXTY YEAR OLDS ARE NOT MAKING ANY 
PROVISION FOR THEIR FUTURE FOR THE 
REASONS THAT YOU DESCRIBED AND SOME 
THAT APPEARED EARLIER IN YOUR 
PROGRAMME 
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO PROGRAMME GIVE THEM TO MAKE THEM CHANGE THEIR 
MINDSS 
FIRST THE ATTITUDE MUST MINDSS CHANGE WE HAVE GOT TO GET ACROSS 
THAT THEY NEED TO THINK ABOUT THEIR 
LIFE COURSE IN THE ROUND AND IN THE 
LONG TERM IF THEY ARE GOING TO 
EXPECT ANY STANDARD ANY QUALITY 
ANY DIGNITY IN THEIR LIFE IN THE 
FUTURE THEY NEED TO MAKE SOME 
FINANCIAL PREPARATION 
THE POINT IS 
A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO 
MAKE THE CONTRIBUTIONS IT IS AN 
ISSUE FOR GOVERNMENT MUCH MORE 
THAN IT IS FOR INDIVIDUALS WELL WELL GOVERNMENT WILL ONLY TAKE THIS SO 
FAR YOU KNOW THE ORGANISATION THAT 
I HELP HELP THE AGED IS TRYING TO 
PRESS THE CASE ON PENSIONS AND 
BENEFITS WE KNOW WITH AN AGEING 
POPULATION MORE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE 
DEPENDENT IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER ON 
THE STATE THERE HAS TO BE SOME 
PERSONAL PROVISION MADE WHAT ONE 
OF THE THINGS THAT WE HOPE THAT 
LIFE TRUSTS FOUNDATION WILL DO IS 
TO PRESS THE INDUSTRY TO COME UP 
WITH MORE INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS 
THANK YOU A QUICK NOTE ON FRIDAY 
WE ARE TACKING MORTGAGE QUESTIONS 
SO DO WATCH ON FRIDAY WE ARE BACK 
TOMORROW TAKE CARE
