IN NINETEEN OH EIGHT THE FRENCH FINANCIER AND INDUSTRIALIST ALBERT KAHN 
LAUNCHED ONE OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS PROJECTS 
IN THE HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY 
HE RECRUITED A TEAM OF PHOTOGRAPHERS 
AND SENT THEM AROUND THE WORLD TO PRODUCE WHAT HE CALLED 
A PHOTOGRAPHIC INVENTORY OF LIFE ON THE PLANET 
THEY USED THE AUTOCHROME 
THE WORLD'S FIRST USER FRIENDLY SYSTEM 
CAPABLE OF TAKING TRUE COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHS 
IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT TWO DECADES 
KAHN'S PHOTOGRAPHERS SHOT OVER SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND AUTOCHROMES 
AND OVER ONE HUNDRED HOURS OF FILM FOOTAGE 
SOME OF THEIR MOST IMPORTANT IMAGES WERE SHOT AFTER THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
IN THE STATES THAT WERE ON THE LOSING SIDE 
COUNTRIES WHOSE EMPIRES DISINTEGRATED IN THE WAKE OF THEIR DEFEAT 
IN NOVEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTEEN 
THE ARMISTICE FINALLY BROUGHT THE GREAT WAR TO AN END 
JUST A MONTH LATER ALLIED TROOPS MARCHED INTO GERMANY 
TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE COUNTRY'S STRATEGICALLY VITAL RHINELAND AREA 
BY THE TERMS OF THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES 
THE ALLIES OCCUPIED THE RHINELAND OF GERMANY FOR A PERIOD OF FIFTEEN YEARS 
AND THE RHINELAND WAS MADE PERMANENTLY A DEMILITARISED ZONE 
THIS WAS TO PREVENT IT BEING A SPRINGBOARD 
FOR UNEXPECTED INVASIONS OF FRANCE 
IF GERMANY REFUSED TO FULFIL ITS COMMITMENTS 
THESE TROOPS IN THE RHINELAND WOULD BE IN A GOOD POSITION 
TO MOVE INTO GERMANY PROPER AND MARCH THROUGH TO BERLIN 
TO RE IMPOSE THE PEACE SETTLEMENT ON GERMANY BY FORCE 
THE FRENCH TRICOLORE NOW FLEW OVER GERMAN TERRITORY 
ACROSS THE RHINELAND 
FRENCH TRANSLATIONS WERE ADDED TO EVERY SIGN 
THE WAR HAD LEFT GERMANY IN POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TURMOIL 
AND THE FINANCIAL PENALTIES EXACTED BY THE ALLIES 
ADDED TO THE COUNTRY'S WOES 
UNDER THE TERMS OF THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES 
GERMANY WAS REQUIRED TO PAY REPARATIONS TO COMPENSATE 
FOR THE DAMAGE SUFFERED BY THE ALLIES DURING THE WAR 
THE SUM DEMANDED WAS COLOSSAL 
MORE THAN SIX POINT FIVE BILLION 
AN ALLIED COMMISSION WAS SET UP 
TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT THAT THE GERMANS SHOULD PAY 
BUT IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO THE GERMANS STOPPED PAYING 
IT SEEMED AS IF THE BRITISH AND THE AMERICANS WERE PREPARED TO ACCEPT THIS 
THE FRENCH AND THE BELGIANS WEREN'T 
AND THEY THEREFORE MOVED BEYOND THE RHINELAND INTO THE RUHR 
IN ORDER TO PHYSICALLY TAKE THE REPARATIONS AND MAINTAIN PAYMENT 
ON JANUARY ELEVENTH NINETEEN TWENTY THREE 
FRENCH TANKS ROLLED INTO GERMANY'S INDUSTRIAL HEARTLAND 
THE COAL MINES AND FACTORIES OF THE RUHR 
HAD BEEN THE DRIVING FORCE OF THE GERMAN ECONOMY 
ITS WORKERS DECIDED TO RESIST THE FRENCH OCCUPATION 
THE RESPONSE TO THE INVASION OF THE RUHR SURPRISED EVERYBODY 
THE RAILWAYMEN SABOTAGED RAILWAYS 
COALMINERS REFUSED TO MINE COAL FOR THE REPARATION AUTHORITIES 
STEELMEN THREATENED TO DAMP DOWN THEIR FURNACES 
IN FACT ECONOMIC LIFE IN THE RUHR QUICKLY CAME TO A STOP 
GERMANY'S ECONOMIC CRISIS DEEPENED 
AS INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION GROUND TO A HALT 
THE GOVERNMENT PRINTED MONEY TO MEET ITS SHORTFALL IN REVENUES 
INFLATION SPIRALLED OUT OF CONTROL 
AND WITHIN A YEAR THE PRICE OF A LOAF OF BREAD ROSE FROM JUST A FEW PFENNINGS 
TO AN ASTONISHING THREE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION MARKS 
THE ECONOMIC MELTDOWN LEFT MILLIONS OF GERMANS STARVING 
WITH THE COUNTRY IN TURMOIL 
POLITICAL ACTIVISTS IN THE RHINELAND AGITATED AGAINST THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT 
AND CAMPAIGNED FOR INDEPENDENCE 
KAHN'S PHOTOGRAPHERS ENCOUNTERED THE SEPARATIST LEADERS 
WHO SIGNALLED THEIR ALLEGIANCE BY WEARING ARMBANDS 
IN RED WHITE AND GREEN THE COLOURS OF THE FLAG 
THEY HOPED WOULD ONE DAY FLY OVER AN INDEPENDENT RHINELAND 
CLEARLY THEY ARE TRYING TO ACT THE STATESMAN HERE 
FOR MONSIEUR KAHN'S CAMERAS 
THESE THEY HOPED WOULD BE THE RECORD OF THEIR FIRST DAYS IN OFFICE 
BUT THE POLITICAL UNREST GENERATED GREAT ANXIETY 
ACROSS THE RHINELAND SHOPKEEPERS BOARDED UP THEIR WINDOWS 
FEARING THAT TROUBLE WAS IMMINENT 
CLEARLY NO ONE WANTS TO BE OUT IN THE STREETS 
THEY HAD NO IDEA WHO MIGHT SHOOT THEM OR WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THEM 
IN THE NORTHERN TOWN OF KREFELD THE SEPARATISTS TURNED TO VIOLENCE 
IN OCTOBER NINETEEN TWENTY THREE THEY STORMED THE TOWN HALL 
AND THEIR GUNFIRE LEFT A POLICEMAN WOUNDED 
HIS FELLOW OFFICERS TRIED TO RESCUE HIM 
BUT HE WAS PULLED INSIDE THE BUILDING 
AND MURDERED AT POINT BLANK RANGE 
THIS REMARKABLE PICTURE SHOWS THE CRIME SCENE 
COMPLETE WITH THE MURDER WEAPON 
SOON NEWS OF THE UNREST IN THE RHINELAND 
REACHED GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD 
THE PROTESTS FROM LONDON WERE ALMOST UNPRINTABLE 
THE REACTION FROM THE UNITED STATES WAS ONE OF INCANDESCENT FURY 
SO WITHIN SEVEN OR EIGHT DAYS 
THE FRENCH AND BELGIAN AUTHORITIES ISSUED INSTRUCTIONS TO THEIR TROOPS 
TO ARREST THE LEADING SEPARATISTS AND TO PUT A STOP TO THE WHOLE THING 
AND THAT WAS THE END OF THE WHOLE SORRY AFFAIR 
KAHN'S GERMAN PHOTOGRAPHS CAPTURE A NATION THAT WAS DESPERATE VIOLENT AND CHAOTIC 
BUT REMARKABLY BY THE END OF NINETEEN TWENTY THREE THE ECONOMY STABILISED 
THANKS IN LARGE PART TO THE ACTIONS OF GERMANY'S NEW CHANCELLOR GUSTAV STRESSEMAN 
IN NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE AS FOREIGN MINISTER STRESSEMAN WAS PART OF A DELEGATION 
THAT RESTORED GERMANY'S REPUTATION AMONGST HER FORMER ENEMIES 
IN THE SWISS TOWN OF LOCARNO EUROPE'S STATESMEN GATHERED 
TO DISCUSS HOW THEY COULD RESOLVE FUTURE INTERNATIONAL TENSIONS 
THE LOCARNO TREATIES SIGNED IN NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE 
WERE THE REAL BEGINNING OF PEACEMAKING IN EUROPE AFTER THE GREAT WAR 
THEY WERE MOST IMPORTANTLY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE IDEA OF ARBITRATION 
IN INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES 
THIS MEANT AND IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE WAR WAS OVER 
THAT PEOPLE WOULD NOT RESORT TO ARMS IN THE FUTURE 
BUT THAT THEY WOULD TRY AND NEGOTIATE THEIR DIFFICULTIES 
KAHN MAY HAVE SECURED ACCESS TO THE MEETINGS THROUGH AN ACQUAINTANCE 
THE FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER ARISTIDE BRIAND 
LATER KAHN INVITED ONE OF THOSE WHO HAD BROKERED THE DEAL AT LOCARNO 
THE BRITISH FOREIGN MINISTER AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN 
TO VISIT HIS HOME IN PARIS 
FOR THEIR PART IN THE NEGOTIATIONS 
CHAMBERLAIN STRESSEMAN AND BRIAND WERE AWARDED THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE 
I SUPPOSE THE ESSENTIAL POINT IS THAT IN PARIS IN NINETEEN NINETEEN 
GERMANY HAD HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO ACCEPT THE PEACE TREATY 
IT COULDN'T FIGHT ON 
BUT THE POINT ABOUT LOCARNO AND THEN ENTERING THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS 
IS HERE IS GERMANY WILLINGLY VOLUNTARILY ACCEPTING INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS 
AND BECOMING A FULL MEMBER OF THE LEAGUE 
ALSO THEREFORE BEING ACKNOWLEDGED AS A GREAT POWER AGAIN 
AND A CIVILISED POWER 
IN THE EARLY NINETEEN TWENTIES THE VICTORIOUS ALLIED NATIONS 
ALSO SOUGHT TO DICTATE THE FUTURE 
OF ANOTHER EMPIRE THEY'D DEFEATED IN THE GREAT WAR 
BY NOVEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTEEN 
LARGE PARTS OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE WERE UNDER ALLIED OCCUPATION 
THE EMPIRE HAD LOST CONTROL OF THE OTTOMAN HEARTLAND OF WESTERN TURKEY 
AND THE CITY OF ISTANBUL 
BUT A GROUP OF YOUNG TURKS PLOTTED TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE COUNTRY 
AND BUILD A NEW NATION FROM THE RUINS OF THE EMPIRE 
THE NEW TURKEY WOULDN'T BE THE ETHNIC PATCHWORK OF THE OTTOMAN ERA 
ITS LEADERS WERE DETERMINED TO CREATE AN ETHNICALLY UNIFIED NATION STATE 
IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO ALBERT KAHN SENT TWO OF HIS PHOTOGRAPHERS 
CAMILLE SAUVEGEOT AND FREDERIC GADMER TO ISTANBUL 
THEIR FILM AND PHOTOGRAPHS DOCUMENT THE CATACLYSMIC EVENTS 
THAT LED TO THE CREATION OF MODERN TURKEY 
WHEN THE FILMMAKERS CAME TO TURKEY THEY CAPTURED A COUNTRY 
THE FILMS REALLY CAPTURE THIS 
THE WAY THAT CITIES WERE DEVASTATED 
THE WAY THAT INFRASTRUCTURE WAS LAID LOW 
PHOTOGRAPHS OF 
DERAILED TRAINS TUMBLING DOWN MOUNTAINS 
CITIES THAT LOOKED LIKE THEY'D BEEN FIREBOMBED 
SORT OF A DRESDEN IMAGE 
FROM THIS THE NEW TURKISH REPUBLIC WOULD HAVE TO BE BUILT 
BUT HOW CAN YOU BUILD A COUNTRY FROM SUCH RUBBLE 
IN NOVEMBER NINETEEN TWENTY TWO 
KAHN'S PHOTOGRAPHERS WITNESSED ONE OF ISLAM'S MOST IMPORTANT RITUALS 
THE INAUGURATION OF THE NEW CALIPH SPIRITUAL LEADER OF ALL MUSLIMS 
THE SULTAN HAD ONCE POSSESSED THIS TITLE BUT NOW HE WAS IN EXILE 
A NEW CALIPH THE OLD SULTAN'S COUSIN ABDULMECID 
HAD BEEN ELECTED TO TAKE ON THIS ROLE 
BUT THE NEW CALIPH FACED AN IMMEDIATE PROBLEM 
EUROPEAN WARSHIPS IN THE BOSPHORUS WERE THE MOST OBVIOUS SIGN 
THAT THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE HAD LOST ALL SOVEREIGNTY 
THAT NOW IT WAS BRITAIN AND FRANCE 
SYMBOLISED BY THEIR SHIPS IN THE HARBOUR HERE 
WHO WERE CONTROLLING THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE 
AND WERE IN CHARGE OF ITS FATE 
BUT THE TURKS WERE DETERMINED TO FIGHT BACK 
THEIR LEADER WAS THE CHARISMATIC MUSTAFA KEMAL 
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS ATATURK OR THE FATHER OF THE TURKS 
AS ONE OF THE MEN RESPONSIBLE 
FOR INFLICTING A DISASTROUS DEFEAT ON THE ALLIES AT GALLIPOLI 
KEMAL HAD PROVED HIMSELF TO BE A RUTHLESS POLITICAL OPERATOR 
AND BRILLIANT MILITARY STRATEGIST 
HE HAD TO BE BECAUSE HE WAS ESTABLISHING A GOVERNMENT 
AND AN ADMINISTRATION FROM SCRATCH 
AND HE HAD COLLEAGUES SOME OF WHOM HE HAD TO DISPENSE WITH 
KEMAL HAD USED HIS POLITICAL ACUMEN TO PREVENT HIS COUNTRY 
FROM BECOMING YET ANOTHER OUTPOST OF A EUROPEAN IMPERIAL POWER 
HE WANTED TURKEY TO BE MODERN SECULAR AND DEMOCRATIC 
BUT KEMAL'S POLICIES MADE LITTLE PROVISION 
FOR THE COUNTRY'S ETHNIC DIVERSITY 
FUNDAMENTALLY KEMAL WAS NOT INTERESTED IN A SPRAWLING STATE 
WHICH WOULD INCLUDE LARGE MINORITIES OF GREEKS OF ARMENIANS OF ARABS OR WHATEVER 
HE WANTED A TURKISH STATE 
A SECULAR TURKEY FOR THE TURKS 
DURING THE WAR IN WHAT'S NOW CONSIDERED 
ONE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY'S MOST APPALLING GENOCIDES 
THE OTTOMANS EXPELLED OR KILLED AT LEAST ONE MILLION ARMENIANS 
WHO'D BEEN LIVING IN EASTERN TURKEY 
BY NINETEEN TWENTY TWO THE TURKS HAD TO CONTEND 
WITH WHAT THEY CONSIDERED TO BE ANOTHER ALIEN PRESENCE WITHIN 
ETHNIC GREEKS HAD BEEN LIVING THROUGHOUT WESTERN TURKEY FOR CENTURIES 
AND MANY BELIEVED THESE LANDS WERE PART OF THEIR HERITAGE 
GENERATION AFTER GENERATION 
MY GRANDFATHER'S MOTHER MY MOTHER'S FATHER 
MY MOTHER'S AND FATHER'S FATHERS 
THEY ALL LIVED AND DIED THERE 
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME 
THERE WOULD BE A GREEK HOUSE AND NEXT DOOR WOULD BE A TURKISH 
THEY ALL LIVED WELL TOGETHER THEY ATE AND DRANK TOGETHER 
THEY WOULD COME TO YOURS YOU WOULD GO TO THEIRS 
THEY WERE LIVING HAPPILY 
BUT THE FRIENDLY RELATIONS 
BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN GREEKS AND THE MUSLIM TURKS DIDN'T LAST 
AT THE END OF THE GREAT WAR 
THE GREEK ARMY OCCUPIED PART OF WESTERN TURKEY 
AROUND THE PORT OF SMYRNA 
GRADUALLY THEY ADVANCED INLAND 
SOON GREEK FORCES WERE LOCKED IN A LONG AND BLOODY STRUGGLE AGAINST THE TURKS 
THE GREEKS AND THE TURKS FIGHT A TWO YEAR WAR OF TREMENDOUS VIOLENCE 
THAT LAYS WHOLE TOWNS AND VILLAGES LOW AND DESTROYED THEM 
WITH A THOROUGHNESS THAT WE WOULDN'T SEE AGAIN 
UNTIL THE FIRE BOMBINGS OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
BY NINETEEN TWENTY TWO 
A QUARTER OF A MILLION GREEK SOLDIERS ENCIRCLED WESTERN TURKEY 
BUT KEMAL PATIENTLY ASSEMBLED A FORCE 
STRONG ENOUGH TO TAKE ON THE GREEKS 
WHEN THE TURKISH COUNTER ATTACK CAME IT WAS SWIFT AND DECISIVE 
THE GREEK ARMY WAS FORCED INTO RAPID RETREAT AND FLED BACK TO THE COAST 
LEAVING A TRAIL OF DEVASTATION BEHIND THEM 
THE GREEK ARMY WHEN IT WAS RETREATING 
DID WHAT ARMIES TRADITIONALLY ALWAYS HAVE DONE 
YOU CAN'T BLAME THEM FOR BEING PARTICULARLY UNPRINCIPLED ABOUT THIS 
BUT THEY SET FIRE TO EVERY TOWN THEY RETREATED THROUGH 
SO AS TO DENY IT TO THE ONCOMING ENEMY 
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE EFFECT THIS WOULD HAVE HAD ON THE CIVILIAN POPULATION 
KAHN'S PHOTOGRAPHERS RECORDED THE NEAR OBLITERATION 
OF TOWNS LIKE ALECHEHIR 
WHERE NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF THE HOUSES WERE DESTROYED 
AND AROUND THREE THOUSAND LIVES WERE LOST 
YOU CAN SEE FROM THE PICTURES 
WHAT STRAITS PEOPLE WERE REDUCED TO 
FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A PICTURE OF A MAN LIVING IN A HOLLOW TREE 
THE MAN'S HOUSE IS UNINHABITABLE 
SO HE'S MADE A TREE INTO HIS ACCOMMODATION 
IN THE TOWN OF MAGNESIA ONLY ONE IN TEN HOUSES SURVIVED THE ONSLAUGHT 
ACCORDING TO KAHN'S PHOTOGRAPHER FREDERICK GADMER 
THIS MAN HAD BEEN TRAPPED INSIDE A BURNING MOSQUE 
HE SURVIVED BUT THE EXPERIENCE DROVE HIM MAD 
THE GREEK ARMY RETREATED THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE 
WITH TURKISH FORCES IN CLOSE PURSUIT 
AFTER SEEING THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR TOWNS 
THE TURKS TOOK REVENGE ON THE GREEK CIVILIANS WHO WERE LEFT BEHIND 
AS THE GREEK ARMY RETREATED 
THE GREEK CIVILIAN POPULATION RETREATED IN ITS WAKE 
CARRYING WHAT THEY COULD WITH THEM TOWARDS SMYRNA 
AND FLOODING INTO SMYRNA IN THE WAKE OF THE GREEK ARMY 
HOPING FOR HELP AND HOPING FOR A MEANS OF EVACUATION 
THE PORT OF SMYRNA WHICH IS TODAY KNOWN AS IZMIR 
WAS SECOND ONLY TO ISTANBUL IN ITS COMMERCIAL IMPORTANCE 
IT WAS DOMINATED BY GREEKS 
WHO'D GIVEN THE CITY A DISTINCTIVELY WESTERN CHARACTER 
BUT THE CITY'S CHRISTIAN MAJORITY 
WERE ABOUT TO HAVE THEIR LIVES SHATTERED 
AS THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES PILED INTO SMYRNA PURSUED BY THE TURKISH ARMY 
IT FELL TO THE TURKS ON SEPTEMBER NINTH NINETEEN TWENTY TWO 
THE TURKISH ARMY ENTERED THE CITY 
THERE WERE TURKISH POLICE TO KEEP ORDER BUT IT DIDN'T LAST 
SOME LOOTING STARTED IN THE ARMENIAN QUARTER 
FIRE BROKE OUT 
AS THE INFERNO SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE CITY 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE LEFT TRAPPED ON THE QUAYSIDE 
FROM THE DECK OF HIS SHIP A BRITISH SAILOR MELVIN JOHNSON 
WITNESSED THE PANIC AND TERROR AT THE WATERFRONT 
AS FAR AS WE COULD GO YOU COULD HEAR 'EM SCREAMIN' AND HOLLERIN' 
AND THE FIRE WAS GOING ON 
MOST PITIFUL THING YOU EVER SAW IN YOUR LIFE 
AND THE CITY WAS SET IN A KIND OF HILL 
AND THE FIRE WAS COMING THIS WAY TOWARDS THE SHIP 
THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY THE PEOPLE COULD GO TOWARD THE WATERFRONT 
A LOT OF 'EM WERE JUMPING IN COMMITTING SUICIDE 
IT WAS A SIGHT ALL RIGHT 
FOR FOUR DAYS SMYRNA WAS CONSUMED BY FLAMES 
IT WAS LIKE A FIRESTORM 
YOU CAN SEE THE HOUSES ARE ROOFLESS AND WINDOWLESS 
THE BUILDINGS HAVE FALLEN APART 
NOBODY REALLY KNOWS HOW OR WHY IT HAPPENED 
AND EVERYBODY BLAMES EVERYBODY ELSE 
THE TURKS SAY THE GREEKS DID IT TO STOP THEM HAVING THE PLACE 
THE GREEKS SAY THE TURKS DID IT TO STOP THEM COMING BACK 
SMYRNA REALLY WAS THE LAST BATTLEFIELD 
OF THE WAR BETWEEN TURKEY AND GREECE 
AND WITH THE FALL OF SMYRNA TO THE TURKS 
IT REALLY SPELLED THE END OF THE GREEK PRESENCE IN MODERN TURKEY 
WITH SMYRNA NOW UNDER CONTROL 
MUSTAFA KEMAL COULD GET ON WITH THE JOB OF BUILDING A TURKISH HOMELAND 
HE SET ABOUT RIDDING HIS COUNTRY OF THE LAST REMNANTS OF THE GREEK CIVILIAN POPULATION 
AND GAVE THE GREEK ARMY A FIFTEEN DAY DEADLINE TO WITHDRAW FROM TURKEY 
KAHN'S PHOTOGRAPHERS CAPTURED ON FILM 
THE PLIGHT OF THOUSANDS OF GREEKS 
AFTER THEY WERE FORCED FROM THEIR HOMES 
A YOUNG AMERICAN REPORTER ERNEST HEMINGWAY 
DESCRIBED THIS EXODUS FOR HIS NEWSPAPER THE TORONTO DAILY STAR 
TWENTY MILES OF EXHAUSTED STAGGERING MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN 
WALKING BLINDLY ALONG IN THE RAIN BESIDE THEIR WORLDLY GOODS 
IT IS A SILENT PROCESSION 
NOBODY EVEN GRUNTS 
IT IS ALL THEY CAN DO TO KEEP MOVING 
THERE'S A BIT OF FOOTAGE 
OF WHAT MUST BE THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES MARCHING AWAY 
AND NONE OF THEM HAS ANY BELONGINGS WITH THEM WHATSOEVER 
WHAT YOU HAVE IS PART OF WHAT YOU ARE 
SO WHEN YOU HAVE TO LEAVE WITH NOTHING 
YOU LOSE SOME OF YOUR IDENTITY 
AS THE REFUGEES FLOODED INTO THE SEAPORTS AND RAILWAY TERMINALS 
KAHN'S PHOTOGRAPHERS CAPTURED THE DESPERATION 
OF PEOPLE FLEEING FOR THEIR LIVES 
THE MOST HAUNTING OF ALL OF THOSE PICTURES 
IS OF AN OLD LADY AND THREE CHILDREN 
PEERING OUT OF A LITTLE OPENING IN THE SIDE OF ONE OF THESE TRUCKS 
WITH A SOLDIER LYING ON THE ROOF ABOVE THEM 
AND THEY'RE ALL LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERA 
AND THIS IMMEDIATELY MAKES YOU THINK OF THE DEPORTATION 
OF PEOPLE TO THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
IF IT WASN'T FOR THE SOLDIER AND HIS UNIFORM 
YOU COULD EASILY THINK IT WAS PEOPLE BEING TRANSPORTED TO AUSCHWITZ 
IT PROVED IMPOSSIBLE TO EVACUATE THE ENTIRE GREEK POPULATION IN TIME 
THOUSANDS DIED OF STARVATION AND DISEASE 
THOSE WHO DID MANAGE TO ESCAPE 
FACED AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE WHEN THEY REACHED GREECE 
WHEN WE ARRIVED IN ATHENS AND PIREUS 
THEY SAID IT'S FULL YOU CAN'T COME THROUGH 
AND SENT US TO TZIA 
WE STAYED A YEAR THERE 
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF MY FATHER 
AND THERE HAD ALWAYS BEEN THREE OF US GIRLS 
UNTIL MY SISTER PASSED AWAY THERE IN TZIA 
SHE DIED IN TZIA BECAUSE WE WERE STARVING 
IN THE SPACE OF JUST SIX MONTHS 
AROUND ONE MILLION GREEKS WERE EXPELLED FROM TURKEY 
IN RETALIATION THE GREEK GOVERNMENT DEPORTED HALF A MILLION TURKS 
WHO WERE A MINORITY COMMUNITY LIVING IN GREECE 
IN JANUARY NINETEEN TWENTY THREE THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS GAVE ITS STAMP OF APPROVAL 
TO THE POPULATION EXCHANGE BETWEEN GREECE AND TURKEY 
THEIR DECISION MADE FORCED MIGRATION 
A LEGITIMATE MEANS OF SOLVING ETHNIC CONFLICTS IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED A WONDERFUL IDEA TO SEPARATE THE POPULATIONS 
IN ORDER TO TURK IFY TURKEY AND GREEK IFY GREECE 
AND PREVENT ANY FUTURE CONFLICT 
IN THE ABSTRACT IT SEEMS LIKE A WONDERFUL IDEA 
BUT WHAT IT AMOUNTS TO IS 
AN IRREVERSIBLE MUCKING UP OF OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES 
WHAT YOU'RE LEFT WITH IS A LIFETIME OF NOSTALGIA 
LONGING FOR WHAT YOU'VE LOST AND CAN NEVER HAVE BACK 
I HAVE BEEN LONGING TO GO BACK THERE 
BUT I HAVEN'T MANAGED TO GET THERE 
HOW COULD I NOT FEEL FOR MY HOMELAND 
ESPECIALLY THE PLACE WHERE I WAS BORN 
ATATURK'S NATIONALISM HELPED TO REBUILD TURKEY 
FROM THE SHATTERED RUINS OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE 
YET HIS POLICIES LEFT A LEGACY OF DEEP ANTAGONISM 
BETWEEN THE TURKS AND MANY OF THEIR MINORITY GROUPS 
AMONG THEM THE KURDS 
WHOSE CULTURE HAS BEEN REPRESSED BY TURKEY EVER SINCE 
THE IMAGES SHOT BY ALBERT KAHN'S PHOTOGRAPHERS 
ARE A UNIQUE RECORD OF THE VIOLENCE AND CHAOS 
THAT AFFLICTED TWO OF THE EMPIRES 
THAT COLLAPSED AFTER THEIR DEFEAT IN THE GREAT WAR 
IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE CONFLICT 
KAHN'S CAMERAS WITNESSED THE DISINTEGRATION OF COMMUNITIES 
THE CREATION OF NEW STATES 
AND FOR MILLIONS 
THE NIGHTMARISH EXPERIENCE OF DISPLACEMENT AND DISPOSSESSION 
KAHN CAPTURED SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENTS OF A PIVOTAL PERIOD 
PRESERVING MOMENTS 
THAT WOULD CHANGE THE DESTINY OF TURKEY GERMANY AND EUROPE FOREVER 
WE'RE IN POMPEII AND IT'S VOLCANO DAY 
YOU SAVE PEOPLE NOT THIS TIME 
SHOW YOURSELF I MUST MAKE THE MOST TERRIBLE CHOICE 
DONNA DOCTOR
