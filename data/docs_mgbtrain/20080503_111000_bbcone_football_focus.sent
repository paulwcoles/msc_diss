GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO FOOTBALL 
FOCUS IT IS GOING DOWN TO THE 
WEST HAM LOVE LOOK PUTTING A 
SPANNER IN FERGIE'S WORKS WE HEAR 
FROM DEAN ASHTON IT'S A SCRAP FOR 
SURVIVAL AS ROY HODGSON'S FULHAM 
TAKE ON BIRMINGHAM QUADRUPLE IS 
STILL ON FOR RANGERS WE ARE WITH 
PLAY OFF CHASING CRYSTAL PALACE 
WHERE CLINTON MORRISON IS DESPERATE 
FOR PREMIER LEAGUE RETURN 
AND CAN PULL OFF AN 
EPIC ESCAPE 
AND TO DISCUSS THE UPS AND DOWNS 
ACROSS ALL THE LEAGUES I'M JOINED 
BY LEE DIXON AND MARK LAWRENSON 
THE WAR OF ATTRITION IS ALMOST OVER 
MANCHESTER UNITED AND CHELSEA ARE 
STILL STANDING AND BOTH ARE 
DREAMING OF BEING CROWNED KINGS OF 
ENGLAND AND EUROPE WITH TWO GAMES 
TO GO IN THE BARCLAYS PREMIER 
LEAGUE ONE HAS THE BETTER GOAL 
DIFFERENCE CHELSEA VISIT NEWCASTLE 
ON MONDAY AND TWO TITLES HANG IN 
THE BALANCE 
LAST SATURDAY LUNCHTIME EVERYTHING 
CHANGED IN THE RACE FOR THE BIG 
PRIZES 
THERE WAS DEFINITELY PRIZES FRUSTRATION WITH THE WAY THE GAME 
WENT TO COME BACK AND GET IT TO ONE 
ONE AND THEN THE PENALTY 
MANCHESTER UNITED COULD BE LEFT COMPLAINING ABOUT 
THIS DECISION FOR YEARS AND AND AND AND SOME DECISIONS THROUGHOUT THE 
SECOND HALF WE WANTED TO WIN THAT 
GAME WE DIDN'T THE DRESSING ROOM 
WAS QUIET A LOT OF FRUSTRATION 
BUT AFTER FIVE MINUTES EVERYBODY 
REALISED WE HAD TO GET FOCUSED FOR 
THE NEXT GAME BECAUSE IT WAS FIVE BIG 
ONE AGAINST BARCELONA 
NOW IT IS 
OPEN AGAIN IT WAS A DAY WHEN WE 
COULD HAVE CLOSED THE LEAGUE AND 
GOT IT OUT OF THE WAY 
EVEN AS A 
CHELSEA SUPPORTER MYSELF I STILL 
FEEL THAT THE ADVANTAGE IS WITH 
MANCHESTER UNITED BUT IT HAS MADE 
IT A LOT TIGHTER 
WE DID SOMETHING THAT NOBODY 
THOUGHT WE'RE ON THE SAME POINTS 
AS MANCHESTER UNITED AND I WANT IN 
CHELSEA TO SAY THANKS TO ALL THESE 
PLAYERS PLAYERS THE TENSION WAS EVIDENT FOR ALL TO 
SEE BUT WHO WAS BEST EQUIPPED TO 
COPE 
WITH IT THE MATCHES ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE WITH A CERTAIN ELEMENT OF PRESSURE 
BUT WE HAVE TO BE HONEST THE 
PRESSURE SORT OF RUBS OFF ON US 
WE'RE USED TO THAT AS PLAYERS 
WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS WHAT 
HAPPENS IN BETWEEN THE MATCHES IS 
THE MANAGER NERVOUS CHRIST I'M 
GOING TO BE NERVOUS TOO BECAUSE HE 
HASN'T GOT THE FAITH IN US 
OBVIOUSLY LOSING THE LAST PREMIER 
LEAGUE AT CHELSEA WOULD BE HARD 
AND SIX POINTS LEFT AND WE NEED 
THOSE SIX POINTS 
FERGIE SEEMED 
RATTLED COULD HIS PLAYERS HOLD 
THEIR NERVE IN THE CHAMPIONS' 
LEAGUE SEMI FINAL ON TUESDAY PAUL 
SCHOLES WHO MISSED THE TEAM'S NINETEEN NINETY NINE 
SUCCESS WAS HOPING FOR VICTORY IN 
BARCELONA 
I JUST DIDN'T FEEL BARCELONA BARCELONA TO SCORE AT ANY TIME 
THERE WERE A FEW CHANCES AND A FEW 
CLOSE MOMENTS WHEN THEY PLAYED 
OVER THE TOP AND BOJAN IF HE GETS 
A TOUCH HE DEFINITELY HAS A GOOD 
CHANCE OF SCORING BUT I THINK WE 
PLAYED WELL AND THE DISCIPLINE AND 
SHAPE OF THE TEAM WAS EXCEPTIONAL 
ON WEDNESDAY IT FIRST CHELSEA'S 
TURN AGAINST LIVERPOOL IN THE WEEK 
WHEN HIS MOTHER DIED FRANK LAMPARD 
PUT GRIEF ASIDE TO SCORE AN 
HISTORIC LANDMARK FOR THE CLUB BUT 
AMAZINGLY THE MANAGER REMAINS UNDER 
PRESSURE 
THIRTIETH APRIL I WAS THE PRESSURE MANAGER OF CHELSEA AND FIRST TIME 
TO THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE WHAT WHAT UPSETS ME IS THAT HE'S NOT BEING 
CELEBRATED YET 
THE GUY IS THE MOST 
SUCCESSFUL CHELSEA MANAGER EVER I I FEEL SO SORRY FOR HIM AND THE FACT 
THAT WE'RE STILL TALKING AND THERE 
IS STILL TALK IN THE PRESS BETWEEN 
NOW AND THE END OF THE SEASON SOME 
OF THE FOCUS IS WHETHER HE IS GOING 
TO BE THERE NEXT SEASON L. THINK IT 
IS UNFAIR ON THE MAN L. JUST HOPE 
HE GETS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENJOY 
WHAT HE HAS SUCCEEDED WITH THIS 
SEASON AND OBVIOUSLY REACH THE 
CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE FINAL 
WELL I 
HOPE NOT 
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THE SNIPBL 
LOOK MY DAUGHTER RUMMI IS TWELVE 
YEARS OLD SHE IS LOVELY AND I LOVE 
HER HAVE MUCH AND SHE ALWAYS ASKS 
ME WHY DO THE MEDIA ALWAYS ASK 
THESE QUESTIONS AND I TELL HER 
THEY LOVE ME 
CHELSEA PLAY ON MONDAY AND UNITED 
COULD STEAL A MARCH ON THEIR RIVALS 
THIS AFTERNOON BY BEATING WEST HAM 
BUT THOUGHTS OF MOSCOW AND THAT 
ALL ENGLISH CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE FINAL 
WON'T BE FAR AWAY 
ARE YOU 
SUPERSTITIOUS 
NOT REALLY ARE YOU SUPERSTITIOUS TOUCH WOOD 
YES I AM I'M THINKING 
THIS IS THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
MUNICH DISASTER MANCHESTER UNITED 
WILL GO AND WIN THE CHAMPIONS' 
LEAGUE JUST TO CELEBRATE THAT ON 
THE OTHER HAND I ALSO THINK THAT 
ROMAN ABRAMOVICH HAS COME INTO 
ENGLAND BOUGHT CHELSEA AND PUT SO 
MUCH MONEY INTO IT AND PUSHED THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE UPWARDS IT HAS 
BECOME MUCH MORE EXCITING AND THEY 
ARE IN THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE FINAL 
IN MOSCOW OF ALL PLACES EXACTLY EXACTLY AND AVRAM GRANT IS DOING WHAT HIS 
PREDECESSOR COULDN'T DO SO 
THAT MEAN TWO TO ONE TO CHELSY 
I HOPE 
NOT NOT CHELSEA 
IT'S BEEN A TERRIFIC WEEK FOR 
CHELSEA 
HAS IT FORCED YOU TO REVISE YOUR 
THOUGHTS 
NO NOT FOR ME IF YOU THOUGHTS GIVE THOSE TWO FIXTURES TO SIR ALEX 
AT THE END OF THE SEASON IT'S BEEN 
A GREAT TITLE RACE AND IT WILL GO 
TO THE WIRE CHELSEA HAVE DONE AN 
AMAZING JOB AND AVRAM GRANT HAS 
DONE A FANTASTIC JOB TO COME BACK 
INTO THE CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FROM 
NOWHERE THEY WERE WRITTEN OFF AND 
PLUGGED AWAY OVERALL I THINK 
MANCHESTER UNITED HAVE BEEN THE 
BEST TEAM THIS SEASON BUT IT'S NOT 
OVER YET IF THERE WAS ONE TEAM YOU 
WOULD SAY THAT IS NOT GOING TO 
WOBBLE AT THE END OF THE SEASON IT 
IS MANCHESTER UNITED BUT HAVING 
SAID THAT THE RESULTS ARE LATE WE 
WERE TALKING ABOUT THE TEAM THAT 
SIR ALEX FERGUSON PUT OUT AGAINST 
CHELSEA AND IT WAS A BIT SURPRISING 
HE DIDN'T PUT OUT A STRONGER TEAM 
I THINK HE THOUGHT THEY COULD GET A 
POINT BUT THEY DIDN'T AND LOST IT 
AND THAT'S THE WHOLE THING ABOUT 
THE BALANCE OVER THE EIGHT DAYS 
THEY WANTED TO WIN THE TWO 
COMPETITION AND STILL BE IN CONTROL 
OF THEIR DESTINY AND IF CHELSEA 
WERE HONEST THEY WOULD RATHER BE 
IN MANCHESTER UNITED'S POSITION 
THAN THEIR OWN 
DO YOU THINK IT IS 
A QUESTION OF TOO LITTLE TOO LATE 
FOR CHELSEA 
IT'S BEEN A FANTASTIC 
EFFORT AND THEY'VE BEEN BRILLIANT 
IF YOU LOOK AT CHELSEA LATELY AND 
DROGBA'S PERFORMANCE AND THE LAST 
TWENTY MINCE AGAINST ARSENAL AND HE 
TRANSFORMED THE MATCH AND IF HE'D 
ONLY BEEN LIKE THAT A MONTH EARLIER 
I THINK THOSE TWO POINTS THEY 
DROPPED AT HOME AGAINST WIGAN WITH 
THAT LATE GOAL THAT'S SO SO 
UNUSUAL FOR THEM AND I THINK THAT 
WILL BE THE DECIDING FACTOR WHAT WHAT ABOUT AVRAM GRANT JOHN TERRY SAYS 
HE DESERVES TO STAY ON AS MANAGER 
YES HE DESERVES A CHANCE IT'S 
DIFFERENT WHEN YOU HAVE AN OWNER 
LIKE ABRAMOVICH ALL OF A SUDDEN 
THEY'VE STARTED TO PLAY GOOD 
FOOTBALL A GOOD SIDE REALLY GOOD 
PLAYERS NO ARGUMENT BUT THEY'VE 
STARTED TO PLAY REALLY GOOD 
FOOTBALL BUT PREVIOUS TO THAT IN 
THE REST OF THE SEASON THEY HADN'T 
DONE AND IF IF YOU WERE THE OWNER 
AND SPENT BILLIONS YOU WANT TO GET 
THE BALANCE RIGHT L. THINK IT'S 
MORE A CASE OF WHAT ABRAMOVICH 
WANTS RATHER THAN GRANT DOING WELL 
AND ALL THE PLAYERS ARE PLAYING 
WELL AT THE END OF THE SEASON AND 
THAT'S WHAT MANAGER WANTS YOU 
WANT YOUR BIG STARS TO STAND UP AND 
BE COUNTED AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE 
DONE BUT THEY WANTED IT EARLIER 
DO YOU THINK A CHANCE TO PREPARE 
AGAINST NEWCASTLE GIVES THEM AN 
ADVANTAGE 
NO WHEN YOU GET THROUGH ADVANTAGE TO WHATEVER FINAL IT IS YOU 
NORMALLY HAVE THE NEXT DAY OFF BUT 
THE DAY AFTER WHEN YOU COME IN FOR 
TRAINING YOU'RE UP THERE IT'S 
UNBELIEVABLE EVERYBODY IN THE CLUB 
IS ON THE CEILING IT'S FANTASTIC 
YOU'RE NOT TIRED OR INJURED AND YOU 
THINK I COULD PLAY FIVE GAMES IN 
A ROW HERE NO PROBLEM THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT RUN IN AT THE END OF 
THE SEASON IF YOU'RE FORTUNATE 
ENOUGH TO BE INVOLVED IN CUP FINALS 
AND CHAMPIONSHIPS YOU DON'T FEEL 
ANYTHING KNOCKS NOTHING 
AND CAN 
CHELSEA OVERPOWER SAY UNITED 
CREATIVITY 
YES IS THAT BRIEF CREATIVITY ENOUGH 
IT WAS BRIEF A SLIP UP ENOUGH AGAINST WEST HAM TODAY MEANS 
MANCHESTER UNITED NO LONGER HAVE 
THE DESTINY OF THE TITLE IN THEIR 
OWN HANDS AND THEY'VE LOST THREE 
TIMES TEVEZ OR WEST HAM 
OH YES WEBSTER HAS MADE TWO TO ONE TO 
WEST HAM 
YOU HAVE A RECORD AGAINST 
THE CHAMPIONS THAT MOST WOULD LOVE 
TO HAVE THREE WINS 
YES MOST 
TEAMS CAN'T REALLY BOAST THAT L. L. 
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS THE FEW 
TIMES WE HAVE PLAYED AND WE'VE 
PLAYED EXCEPTLY WELL ON THE DAY AND 
PERHAPS GOT A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK AS 
WELL BUT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO 
NEED THAT AGAIN TO GET FIVE RESULT 
BECAUSE MAN UNITED AT HOME WHEN 
THEY'RE GOING FOR A TITLE I THINK 
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO GET A 
RESULT WE HAD A HELL OF A LOT TO 
PLAY FOR BUT FOR US IT'S TRYING 
TO END THE SEASON WELL BUT WE 
COULD HELP CHELSEA IN A SENSE AND AND DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE CHELSEA'S 
YEAR THE WAY THEY'VE PROGRESSED 
THROUGH THE SEASON AND PICKED UP 
SPEED AT THE RIGHT TIME 
I WOULD 
HAVE SAID MANCHESTER UNITED ALL 
THE WAY THROUGH THE WAY THEY'VE 
PLAYED THEY'VE LOOKED LIKE 
CHAMPIONS BUT CHELSEA GRIND OUT 
THE RESULTS AND GET ONE TO ZERO WINS HERE 
AND THERE AND DON'T LET IN MANY 
GOALS BUT IT COULD BE TIGHT AND 
COULD GO DOWN TO THE LAST GAME I 
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
MOST PEOPLE 
WILL REMEMBER THE END OF LAST 
SEASON AND THE ROLES ARE REVERSED 
THAT TIME YOU HAD TO WIN TO STAY 
UP NOW THEY HAVE TO WIN TO KEEP 
THEIR TITLE HOPES GOING 
EXACTLY L. 
REMEMBER WATCHING IT MYSELF AND IT 
WAS AN ENTHRALLING MATCH IT WAS 
VERY INTENSE AND TO COME OUT WITH A 
WIN AT OLD TRAFFORD ON THE LAST DAY 
WAS AMAZING 
TEVEZ A MINUTE INTO STOPPAGE TIME 
I THINK TEVEZ 
ENJOYED HIS GOAL BUT HE WOULDN'T BE 
SO HAPPY IF MANCHESTER SCORED THIS 
TIME 
YES IT'S INTERESTING HOW THE TIME ROLES ARE REVERSED OBVIOUSLY LIKE 
YOU SAY IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT 
FOR HIM ON SATURDAY 
WHAT ABOUT YOURSELF THIS SEASON 
DEAN WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY IT'S 
BEEN ANOTHER FRUSTRATING SEASON FOR 
YOU 
I WOULDN'T SAY FRUSTRATING YOU I'M REALLY PLEASED THAT I'VE PRETTY 
MUCH BEEN FIT FOR SELECTION FOR 
MOST OF THE SEASON BAR FOUR OR 
FIVE GAMES I THINK I'VE ONLY 
MISSED WHICH AFTER A YEAR OUT I 
THINK I'VE DONE REALLY WELL I'M 
PLEASED WITH THAT IT HAS BEEN 
DIFFICULT IN TERMS OF BEING LEFT ON 
THE BENCH AND NOT BEING ABLE TO GET 
INTO A RHYTHM AS A STRIKER YOU 
NEED TO PLAY GAMES TO GET INTO A 
RHYTHM BUT THAT WAS THE MANAGER'S 
DECISION AND ALL I COULD DO WAS 
KEEP WORKING HARD AND WAIT FOR MY 
CHANCE AND I FEEL THAT I DO 
PLAY REGULARLY I'LL PLAY WELL AND 
SCORE GOALS 
NOT LONG UNTIL THEY 
KICK OFF AT OLD TRAFFORD STEVE 
WILSON IS THERE FOR US 
GOOD AFTER ENGINE THERE HAVE BEEN 
QUESTIONS OVER WAYNE ROONEY'S 
FITNESS WHAT IS THE NEWS 
WELL IT 
IS WHAT IS IN THE LOCKER AFTER THE 
LAST SEVEN DAYS SIR ALEX FERGUSON 
IS NOT ALLOWING THE POSSIBILITY OF 
TIREDNESS TO BE A FACTOR THEY HAVE 
TO WIN AND HIS RESPONSE IS AN 
UNCHANGED ELEVEN VIDIC IS STILL OUT WAYNE ROONEY 
HAS NOT MADE IT BECAUSE OF THE HIP 
INJURY HE IS NOT ON THE BENCH 
DESPITE WHAT HIS MANAGER WAS SAYING 
DURING THE WEEK SO RHONDDA CYNON 
T. A. F. AND TEVEZ CONTINUE UP FRONT 
THAT RONALDINHO AND TEVEZ 
CONDITION FRONT THE VISITORS 
WITHOUT LJUNGBERG IT'S INTERESTING HERE TODAY THERE 
IS NO PARTY ATMOSPHERE NOT AT ALL 
DESPITE THE WIN OVER BARCA AND THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL TO COME 
IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY NERVEY PLACE 
TO BE TODAY THEY MIGHT JUST NEED 
EVERY BIT OF DISCIPLINE THEY SHOWED 
ON TUESDAY NIGHT YOU KNOW WHAT 
AFTER THE SEASON WE HAVE HAD WHO 
IS TO SAY THERE AREN'T MORE TWISTS 
TO COME WHAT ODDS ON MANCHESTER 
UNITED AND CHELSEA DROPPING POINTS 
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS SO NO 
WAYNE ROONEY NOT EVEN ON THE BENCH 
I THINK THERE WERE REPORTS IN THIS 
MORNING'S PAPERS HE IS STRUGGLING 
TO MAKE THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL 
IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD DOES IT THEY THEY SAY HE HAS A HERNIA PROBLEM THERE 
IS ONE THING ABOUT THAT HE CAN 
PLAY WITH IT IT MAY BE THE CASE 
THEY REST HIM FOR A WHILE A LITTLE 
BEST OF REST AND PLAY IN THE FINAL 
AND THEN HAVE THE OPERATION L. 
DISAGREE I DON'T THINK THEY WILL 
BE NERVEY WHEN HAVE YOU THE TWO 
GAMES AWAY THIS ONE IS AT HOME L. THINK YOU JUST GO FOR IT 
THEY WON'T BE NERVOUS AT ALL THAT THAT IS WHAT YOU PLAY FOR TOP CLUBS YOU 
ARE GOING TO GO FOR CHAMPIONSHIPS 
THIS IS THE FEELING YOU DON'T GET 
YOU ARE PREPARING FOR THESE GAMES 
THE FEELING YOU GET AT HOME WEST 
HAM AT HOME THEY WILL BE LOVING 
THIS THAT IS WHAT TOP PLAYERS WANT 
TO PLAY IN TOP GAMES LIKE THIS 
WILLETS TALK ABOUT THE HAMMERS 
LAST THING THE FANS WILL WANT TO DO 
IS HAND CHELSEA WIN HERE WHAT 
WILL THEY DO TO MOTIVATE THEMSELVES 
THE WEST HAM FANS CONSIDERING THEY 
ARE SECURE INTENT AT THE MINUTE 
YOU ARE LOOKING THAT TO COME FROM 
THE MANAGER AND THE COACHING STAFF 
SOMETIMES BECAUSE THERE IS NO 
PRESSURE ON A TEAM YOU ACTUALLY 
PLAY BETTER AND CERTAINLY ONE OR 
TWO OF THE PLAYERS START TO PERFORM 
WHO HAVEN'T BEEN WEST HAM OF LATE 
HAVE BEEN AVERAGE AT BEST L. THINK 
MANCHESTER UNITED TODAY COULD 
SAVAGE THEM REALLY 
THEY HAVEN'T REALLY GOT A TEVEZ OR A DICANIO ONCE THE 
FIRST GOAL GOES IN I THINK THEY 
WILL GET THREE OR FOUR TODAY 
TALKING ABOUT WEST HAM AVRAM GRANT 
WASN'T HAPPY WITH COMMENTS MADE BY 
ALAN CURBISHLEY SAYING IT WOULD BE 
A GREAT JUSTICE IF UNITED FAILED TO 
WIN THE LEAGUE TITLE 
I AM NOT 
DOUBTING THE INTEGRITY OF WEST HAM 
AND I DON'T HAVE A REASON TO DOUBT 
THE INTEGRITY OF ALAN CURBISHLEY L. 
THINK IT'S WRONG TO SAY THINGS LIKE 
THIS HE IS INVOLVED IN THE GAMES 
AGAINST UNITED AND WEST HAM WON 
AGAINST THEM LAST THREE OR FOUR 
GAMES 
I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO 
SAY THINGS LIKE THIS 
HAS AVRAM GRANT GOT POINT 
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE ARTICLE LAURO 
SAYS WHEN YOU READ THE ARTICLE IT 
DOES SOUND BIT OVER THE TOP L. 
DON'T THINK THAT COME GOES THROUGH 
TO THE PLAYERS WHO ARE GOING TO 
PLAY THE GAME 
WE ARE STILL 
INVOLVED IN THE TITLE RACE SURELY 
YOU SHOULD N. T. S. BE MAKING THOSE 
VIEWS PUBLIC 
NO BUT YOU CAN STILL HAVE A 
OPINION ON WHO IS THE BEST RESULT 
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE NEXT 
IF YOU 
THAI THAT MAN NIGHT ARE THE BEST 
TEAM THAT IS MY OPINION IF HE IS 
TOTALLY OVERBOARD SAYING HE IS 
GOING TO RAISE A GLASS IS HE MATES 
WITH GRANT FERRET 
SAME REALLY 
WITH ALEX FERGUSON SAME REALLY HE 
DIDN'T MEAN IT ANY OTHER WAY OTHER 
THAN MAN UNITED ARE THE BEST TEAM 
AND GETS ON WELL WITH ALEX FERGUSON 
I THINK ILL ADVISED TO SAY IT BUT 
I DON'T THINK HE MEANT ANYTHING 
ABOUT IT 
CHELSEA PLAY ARSENAL 
THEY HAD A TERRIFIC WIN ON MONDAY 
NIGHT PUTTING SIX PAST DERBY CESC 
FABREGAS SAYING THEY CAN STILL WIN 
THE TITLE A BIT OPTIMISTIC 
FOR SURE 
HE IS JUST TRYING TO KEEP THE 
SEASON GOING A GREAT RESULT THEY 
ARE NOT FAR SHORT THEY HAVE BEEN 
COURTING FEW AREAS DEFENCIVELY 
THEY LET IN A FEW TOO MANY GOALS IN 
ARSENE WENGER HAS SAID THAT 
CREATIVELY THEY ARE PROBABLY THE 
BEST TEAM IN THE SIDE WHEN THEY 
PLAY WELL BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY 
HAVE LET THEMSELVES DOWN IN KEY 
AREAS DEFENCIVELY YOU CAN'T DO 
THAT 
I THINK THERE ACCENT YOUTHS THAT ARSENAL'S PROBLEM WITH THE 
PRESSURE OFF THEY ARE AN 
OUTSTANDING TEAM WITH THE PRESSURE 
ON FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH AND APRIL 
THEY DIPPED A LITTLE BIT YOU ARE 
RIGHT IT'S VERY CLOSE BETWEEN 
SUCCESS AND FAILURE SO KEY 
PERFORMANCES FROM CERTAIN PLAYERS 
ADEBAYEOUR WITH THE HAT TRICK 
WHAT ABOUT 
I THINK THE WAY 
THAT ARSENE WENGER HAS SAID WHAT IS 
GOING ON HE HAS HAD HIS HEAD 
TURNED AND HE IS GOING TO GO FOR 
THE MONEY WHICH IS SAD BECAUSE HE 
HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST 
INFLUENTIAL PLAYER THIS IS SEASON 
HE HAS HAD GREAT SEASON WHICH 
SHOWED WHY CESC FABREGAS PLAYED SO 
WELL THINK HE PROBABLY WILL GO 
I THINK HE'S GONE HE HAS GONE TO 
MILAN 
WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE MILAN STEP IN AND SAVE 
THRP IS TALK OF 
BARRY MOVING L. THINK HE WOULD BE 
AN EXCELLENT SIGNING FOR ARSENAL L. 
DON'T THINK THEY WILL GET HIM BUT 
HE IS THE TYPE OF PLAYER THEY NEED 
A SOLID PLAYER IN MIDFIELD WILL WILL LET'S GET YOUR VIEWS ON SVEN GORAN 
ERIKSSON THIS TIME A FEW WEEKS AGO 
THE INDICATIONS WERE HE WOULDN'T BE 
THERE IT SOUNDS LIKE HE DEFINITELY 
WOULDN'T BE THERE HOW CAN THAKSIN 
SHINAWATRA MISREAD THE SITUATION TO 
BADLY BADLY BECAUSE HE CAN L. HAVE NO IDEA 
HONESTLY IF THAT IS THE VIEW OF 
THAKSIN SHINAWTRA FINE TO BE FAIR 
TO SVEN YOU ARE BETTER OFF OUT OF 
IT YOU FINISH IN THE TOP TEN AND 
DO A REALLY GOOD JOB HE HAS GIVEN 
THE CLUB BACK THEIR RESPECT ALL OF 
THE THINGS IS HE GOOD MANG E. HE 
IS NOT THERE FOR THE SHORT TERM 
WELL HE IS BUT THAT WASN'T HIS 
IDEA THINK IT'S A CRAZY DECISION 
THE CITY FANS ARE PULLING THEIR 
HAIR OUT ABSOLUTELY MADNESS AS AS FORMATTERS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE WHAT A GAME IN 
STORE AT CRAVEN COTTAGE TODAY WHERE 
FULHAM THREE POINTS ADRIFT TAKE ON 
THE TEAM JUST ABOVE THEM 
BIRMINGHAM FULHAM HAVE A FIGHTING 
CHANCE THANKSS TO TWO WINS FROM 
THEIR LAST THREE MANAGER ROY 
HODGSON WILL NEED TO DRAW ON HIS 
EXPERIENCE TO KEEP THEM UP THERE 
IT WAS THE GOLDEN AGE OF ENGLISH 
MANAGER LONG BEFORE THE GAME FELL 
IN LOVE WITH CONTINENTAL COACHES 
AS HOME GROWN HEROES CLOUGH 
PAISLEY AND ROBSON SWEPT ALL BEFORE 
THEM IT'S LITTLE WONDER THAT THE 
UNASSUMING EXPLOITS OF A BUS 
DRIVER'S SON FROM CROYDON WENT 
UNNOTICED BUT AWAY FROM THE 
LIMELIGHT ROY HODGSON WAS BUILDING 
A CAREER TITLES IN SWEDEN AND 
DENMARK BEFORE GUIDING SWITZERLAND 
TO A WORLD CUP AND INTER MILAN TO A 
UEFA CUP FINAL JUST ONE THING WAS 
MISSING SUCCESS IN HIS HOMELAND SO 
AFTER SPELLS AT BRISTOL CITY AND 
BLACKBURN ENDED BADLY DOES HE FEEL 
HE HAS SOMETHING TO PROVE 
I AM 
QUITE HAPPY WITH MY C. V. QUITE 
RELAXED ABOUT THAT 
THE FACT IS THE MASS MEDIA FOCUS ON 
THE PEOPLE THEY WANT TO FOCUS ON 
AND THE FACT I HAVE NOT BEEN ONE OF 
THOSE THEY FOCUSED ON HASN'T 
BOTHERED ME 
YOU CAME HERE HAVING 
BEEN INVITED TO GO BACK TO INTER 
MILAN WAS IT A DIFFICULT SITUATION 
GIVEN THE SITUATION FULHAM WERE IN 
IT WASN'T A DIFFICULT SITUATION I 
KNEW IT WOULD BE A DIFFICULT JOB 
LUCKILY THE PRESIDENT OF 
INTERRELEASED ME FROM MY JOB AND 
HOPEFULLY THAT OPPORTUNITY MIGHT 
STILL BE AVAILABLE SOME TIME IN THE 
FUTURE AT THE MOMENT IT WAS A 
GREAT OPPORTUNITY I THOUGHT TO 
COME BACK INTO THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
AND TRY TO HELP FULHAM AVOID 
RELEGATION AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE 
STILL IN THE THROWS OF DOING 
FULHAM'S HISTORY IS LITTERED WITH 
COLOURFUL CHARACTER NONE MORE SO 
THAN THE CURRENT CHAIRMAN AGAINST 
WHOM THE QUIET HODGSON IS A REAL 
CONTRAST HE ADMITS IT'S TOO EARLY 
TO SAY IF THIS WILL BE A LONG TERM 
ALLIANCE 
HE IS A BUSY MANNISHES ALLIANCE SPEAK TO HIM ON THE REGULAR BASIS 
IN THE SHORT PERIOD I HAVE YOU 
CAN'T FORGE THE RELATIONSHIP LIKE I 
HAD WITH INTER 
DO YOU THINK YOUR 
JOB DEPARTMENT DEPENDS ON KEEPING 
INTERUP 
I DON'T KNOW INTERUP I HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT 
BUT THESE ARE QUESTIONS YOU GUYS 
LIKE TO ASK YOU KNOW WHAT ANSWERS 
I LIKE TO GIVE IF WE TALK OF 
PEOPLE BEING ASKED TO LEAVE THERE 
IS NOT MUCH WE CAN DO ABOUT IT 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS I AM NOT 
OVER MY THIRTY TWO YEARS STILL COME TO 
TERMS OF IN TERMS OF WORKING OUT 
WHAT ANSWERS YOU EXPECT FROM US 
HERE IS KAMARA THE GREAT ESCAPE IS 
DEFINITELY ON WOULD YOU AGREE TO A 
CERTAIN EXTENT THE PRESSURE ON THIS 
MATCH IS MORE ON BIRMINGHAM 
BECAUSE YOU CAME BACK AT MANCHESTER 
CITY THEY LOST A LEAD AT HOME TO 
LIVERPOOL 
I THINK THE PRESSURE IS LIVERPOOL ON BOTH TEAMS IL STILL BELIEVE 
IT'S THE BEST TEAM THAT WILL GO 
THROUGH FIRING UP PEOPLE FOR GAMES 
BUT PLAYING GOOD FOOTBALL 
THROUGHOUT NINETY MINUTES AND DOING 
WHAT IS NEEDED TO WIN THE GAME THAT 
IS A DIFFERENT MATTER ALTOGETHER 
AS FAR AS YOUR C. V. GOES TO KEEP 
FULHAM IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE FROM 
THE POSITION THEY WERE IN THAT 
WOULD BE PERHAPS THE GREATEST 
ACHIEVEMENT WOULD IT 
I THINK IT 
WOULD BE A GOOD ONE L. L. WOULD BE 
VERY PROUD OF IT IF WE COULD DO IT 
AT THE SAME TIME IT'S CERTAINLY 
NOT JUST MY ACHIEVEMENT IF IT 
HAPPENS IT'S BEEN VERY MUCH A JOINT 
EFFORT IF WE DO HAVE TO ACCEPT 
IT'S NOT BEEN OUR YEAR AND WE ARE 
ONE IN THE THREE THAT IS HAVE 
ACCEPT RELEGATION WE WILL BE 
WILLING TO GO DOWN FIGHTING 
LET'S GO LIVE TO CRAVEN COTTAGE 
WHERE WE FIND JOHN MOTSON HOW 
CRUCIAL DO YOU SEE TODAY'S GAME IN 
THE FIGHT FOR SUFFICIENT VIFL IT'S IT'S D. SURVIVAL IT'S A MUST WIN GAME 
FOR FULHAM A DRAW IS NOT GOOD 
ENOUGH FOR THEM IT MIGHT BE FOR 
BIRMINGHAM THERE IS ONE THING 
ABOUT BEING HERE ROY HODGSON 
MENTIONED HE WANTS TO SEE GOOD 
FOOTBALL BEING PLAYED YOU COULDN'T 
HAVE A BETTER SURFACE THE PITCH 
HERE IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC DO 
YOU REMEMBER THE DAYS LAURO WILL 
WHEN PITCHES WERE BARE AT THE END 
OF THE SEASON NOT ANYMORE TODAY'S TODAY'S REFEREE IS GOING TO BE UNDER 
SCRUTINY 
WELL IT'S NOT SO MUCH SCRUTINY CHRIS FOY IT'S THE BIRMINGHAM 
CENTRE BACK WHO HAS BEEN DANCING UP 
AND DOWN IN FRONT OF THE GOALKEEPER 
ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS 
BIRMINGHAM HAVE SCORED THOSE TWO 
GOALS L. UNDERSTAND THAT THE FULHAM 
COVING STAFF ARE GOING TO SEE CHRIS 
FOY BEFORE THE GAME TO GET 
CLARIFICATION AS TO WHETHER THIS IS 
ALLOWED OR NOT THEY HAVE TWO 
ARGUMENTS ONE HE IS STANDING IN A 
OFFSIDE POSITION IF HE IS 
STANDING IN AN OFFSIDE IS HE 
DISTRACTING THE GOALKEEPER OR IS IT 
GAMESMANSHIP ALSO I UNDERSTAND 
THAT MOHAMED AL FAYED GOING TO GO 
INTO THE FULHAM DREGSINGROOM AND 
SAY A FEW WORDS AS WELL 
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT BIRMINGHAM 
WILL BE FEELING CONFIDENCE WISE I I WAS THERE FOR THE LIVERPOOL GAME 
THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THEY 
HAD THE GAME LOCKED UP AND ALLOWED 
LIVERPOOL BACK INTO IT THEY MAY 
HAVE DAMIEN JOHNSON THE XAP TAIN 
WHO IS A COMPETITIVE MIDFIELD 
PLAYER OTHER THING WE HAVEN'T 
MENTIONED IS THAT KAMARA HAVING 
SCORED THE TWO GALES AT MANCHESTER 
CITY HE HAS STAKED A BIG CLAIM FOR 
A STARTING POSITION THIS AFTERNOON 
WHO YOUR GUT FEELING AS TO WHO WILL 
BE RELEGATED IT'S TOUGH L. THINK 
FULHAM HAVE TO WIN 
IF THEY DO AND 
THEY HAVE TO DRAG BIRMINGHAM BACK 
DOWN THEY WILL BE WITH THEIR TRAN 
SISTOR RADIOS KEEPING UP TO SPEED 
WITH THE GAME AT READING AND AT 
HOME TO SPURS EVEN THEN THEY MAY 
NOT KNOW BECAUSE BOLTON AND 
SUNNERLAND DON'T KICK OFF UNTIL 
FIVE POINT ONE FIVE 
WITH STAKES SO HIGH AT THIS FIVE HUNDRED FIFTEEN STAGE OF THE SEASON WITH THE 
REFEREE DIDN'T WHY HAS IT NOT BEEN 
CLEARED UP REFEREE INCIDENT 
WHY HAS IT NOT BEEN CLEARED UP 
PRESUMABLY THERE IS NO RULE TO SAY 
HE IS BER FEARING WITH PLAY 
HE IS 
WE THINK HE IS BUT OBVIOUSLY NOT 
BECAUSE THE GOALS HAVE BEEN ALLOWED 
THE ONE HE SCORED AGAINST EVERTON 
GOING INTO THE GAME FULHAM I 
THOUGHT WHEN LIVERPOOL BEAT THEM AT 
HOME I THOUGHT THEY WERE GONE 
THEY HAD COME UP WITH TWO AWAY WINS 
ON THE SPIN VERY GOOD L. THINK 
THEY WILL WIN TODAY THINK BIRMINGHAM ARE SHOT MENTALLY I THINK 
GOING 
INTO THE LAST FEW 
GAMES YOU NEED SOME MOMENTUM IT'S 
ALL WITH FULHAM THINK ROY 
HODGSONS THE MIDAS TOUCH SAID 
TWO MONTHS AGO MAYBE THEY AUTOSTAY 
UP 
WE L. A. F. D. L. AM HOPING THEY STAY UP UP NOW LAUGHED 
LOOKING AT SOME LAUGHED FIXTURES TODAY 
SIMON BROTHERBROTHERTON IS AT THE 
CAROLE MADGE 
THE LAST THING THAT COPPEL NEEDS IS 
TO SUSPEND TWO OF HIS PLAYERS FOR 
ILL DISCIPLINE 
JUST AT THE TIME ILL DISCIPLINE WHEN READING'S PLAYERS ALL NEED TO 
BE SINGING OFF THE SAME SHEET 
SOONKO ARE BOTH MARGINAL PLAYERS 
THEY BOTH REFUSED TO PLAY FOR THE 
RESERVES IRONICALLY AGAINST 
TOTTENHAM LAST MONDAY STEVE 
COPPELL HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO 
SUSPEND AND FINE THEM ANY MANAGER 
WOULD DO THAT OTHERWISE HIS 
AUTHORITY IS UNDERMINED IT'S AN 
UNWELCOME DISTRACTION IN AN 
IMPORTANT WEEK 
OTHER BIG WORRY IS 
HIS SIDE'S FAIL YOUR TO SCORE FOR 
THE LAST FIVE GAMES IT'S IT'S EXTRAORDINARY I WAS LOOKING AT IT 
READING HAVEN'T SCORED SINCE THE 
TWENTY SECOND OF MARCH THEY DIDN'T SCORE IN 
APRIL THAT IS FIVE MATCHES NEARLY 
SEVEN AND THREE QUARTER HOURS 
WHATEVER WAY YOU LOOK AT IT IT'S 
NOT CLEVER THERE ARE PLENTY OF 
THEM FOR READING PEOPLE ARE TALK 
ABOUT BIRMINGHAM AND BOLTON AS THE 
LIKE ONES TO GO DOWN NOTTS LOOKING 
GREAT FOR READING THEY HAVE 
SUCCEEDED MORE GOALS APART FROM 
DERBY THEY HAVE LOST MORN MATCHES 
THEY HAVE ONLY ONE THREE TIMES IN 
ALL COMPETITIONS SINCE BOXING DAY 
THE SIGNS ARE OF A WORRYING SLIDE 
THEY HAVE TWO MATCHES LEFT LIKE 
EVERY ONE ELSE THEY HAVE O. WIN ONE 
OF THE TWO MATCHES 
J. P. YOUR FELL 
LOW STRUGGLERS BOLTON A BIG BOOST 
FOR THEM THEY HAVE KEVIN DAVIS 
BACK BACK THAT'S RIGHT BACK FROM SUSPENSION 
AND A BROKEN WRIST IMPORTANT FOR 
BOLTON NOT BECAUSE HE SCORES GOALS 
FLUENTLY HE ONLY GOT FOUR THIS 
SEASON BUT BECAUSE HE PUTS HIMSELF 
ABOUT IN SUCH A PHYSICAL WAY 
SUNDERLAND WILL HAVE THEIR HANDS 
FULL THEIR SEASON HAS COME TO AN 
END IN THE FACT THEY ARE SAFE 
DON'T THINK THAT ROY KEANE WILL 
ALLOW ANY PASSENGERS IN HIS TEAM 
THAT IS FOR CERTAIN THE KEY IS 
THAT BOLTON KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE TO 
DO THEY WILL BE KICKING OFF AFTER 
THE OTHERS SPECIALLY IF FULHAM 
BEAT BIRMINGHAM CITY THEN BOLT 
WILL KNOW IF THIS WIN TODAY THEY 
ARE IN WITHIN THE POSITION OF 
SAFETY IT'S A BIG FACTOR TO THE 
LATE KICK OFF 
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT 
BOLTON MUST TRAVEL TO CHELSEA ON 
THE FINAL DAY THAT MAKES THIS A 
MUST WIN FOR THEM 
IF THEY DON'T 
WIN THEY ARE IN REAL PERIL FULHAM 
BIRMINGHAM IS A KEY MATCH REDDING 
IS A MASSIVE MATCH THIS ONE HAS TO 
BE IS A BOLTON VICTORY OTHERWISE 
THEY COULD BE DOWN AFTER SEVEN 
YEARS IN THE TOP FLIGHT THAT WOULD 
BE A SHAME FOR THIS GROUND BUT SO 
MUCH HAS GONE ON HERE OVER THE LAST 
FOURTEEN YEARS THREE MANAGERS IN TWELVE 
MONTHS I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN 
MANY PROBLEMS HERE IN THE SEASON 
THEY ARE JUST ABOUT GETTING IT 
RIGHT HERE THEY DON'T SCORE ENOUGH 
GOALS THEY HAVE SCORED NINE IN FIFTEEN 
SPECIALLY ON THIS GROUND LATE ON 
IN A MATCH THEY WON'T WANT IT TO BE 
ALL SQUARE BECAUSE SUNDERLAND ARE 
THE MASTERS OF PICKING UP POINTS 
BOLTON WILL BE NERVEY 
O. K. THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LET'S LOOK AT 
THE BOTTOM OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
TABLE WHAT IS YOUR MONEY ON IN 
TERMS OF JOINING DERBY IN THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
I THINK BIRMINGHAM WILL GO I HAVE 
A FEELING THAT READING WILL ALSO BE 
RELEGATED IT'S A GREAT WORRY 
READING 
I FEEL SORRY FOR STEVE READING COPPELL TWO LADS WON'T PLAY IN THE 
RESERVE THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO 
IS RIP UP THEIR CONTRACT AND SAY 
GET OUT OF TOWN FOR ME THEY CAN'T 
SCORE GOALS AND THEY ARE CONCEDING 
YOU LOOK AT THE MINUS GOAL 
DIFFERENCE L. THINK READING 
BIRMINGHAM AND DERBY I WOULD HAVE 
TO GO FOR 
YOU AGREE 
BOLT VN TO GET SOMETHING AGAINST 
SUNDERLAND TODAY BOLTON HAVE TO 
GET SOMETHING AGAINST SUNDERLAND 
TODAY CHELSEA WILL BE ALL GUNS 
BLAZING TODAY FULHAM THEY PLAYED 
MORTGAGES MOUTH THE LAST GAME 
PORTSMOUTH ONE EYE ON THE CUP FINAL 
YOU NEVER KNOW 
SUNDERLAND ARE SAFE AREN'T THEY 
WHATEVER YOU SAY YES THEY ARE 
GOING TO GO AND TRY AND BUT THERE 
IS A DIFFERENCE THAT FIVE PER CENT MAKES ALL 
THE DIFFERENCE 
IT'S BOUND TO BE 
ANOTHER TENSE AFTERNOON FULL THE 
TWISTS AND TURNS WE WILL KEEP YOU 
UP TO DATE PRESS RED 
NOW ON TO RANGERS AND THEY'RE 
THROUGH TO THE UEFA CUP FINAL 
WHERE THEY'LL FACE ZENITY SAINT 
PETERSBURG THE GAME ON SATURDAY 
NIGHT WAS DOMINATED BY THE HOME 
SIDE CHRIS IAN SCORED 
BUT THERE WAS A YELLOW CARD WITH 
TEN MINUTES REMAINING BUT THE 
SCOTS' DEFENCE HELD FIRM TAKING 
THE GAME INTO PENALTIES GARY 
FERGUSON STEPPED UP BUT HE WAS 
SAVED SUPERBLY AND SEBASTIAN FRY 
WAS ALSO SAVED SO IT WAS DOWN TO 
NACHO NOVO TO SEAL RANGERS' PLACE 
IN A FINAL SINCE NINETEEN MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE 
IT WAS BRILLIANT 
THE GAME IT 
WAS A STRANGE ONE FOR THEM TO PLAY 
IN MANY WAYS BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE ANY GREAT ATTACKING TALENT AT 
THE MOMENT AND THEY DEFENDED 
BRILLIANTLY BRILLIANTLY AND THEIR GOAL KEEPING THE KEEPER 
HARDLY HAD TO MAKE A SAVE IN THE 
GAME IT TOOK RANGERS SEVENTY FOUR MINUTES TWENTY TWO 
SECONDS I WROTE IT DOWN THAT WAS 
THEIR FIRST SHOT ON GOAL BUT WHAT 
A FAN TAFBLGIC PERFORMANCE THEY'VE THEY'VE COME FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE 
THEY'VE COME UNDER SOME STICK FOR 
PLAYING DIRTY BUT 
BUT WHAT A 
FINAL 
YES THEY HAVE DONE SOME FINAL GOOD PERFORMANCES BUT THE LUCK IS 
WITH THEM AND I THINK THEY'LL WIN 
IT IT RANGERS' ATTEMPT TO SECURE THE 
QUADRUPLE WILL BE MADE MUCH HARDER 
IF CELTIC CAN WIN AGAINST 
MOTHERWELL LATER 
BUT WALTER SMITH'S SIDE WILL HAVE 
FOUR GAMES IN HAND TO MAKE THE 
POINTS BACK UP IT HAS GOT 
INTERESTING AGAIN WHOSE POSITION 
WOULD YOU RATHER BE IN RANGERS RANGERS I'LL GO FOR CELTIC BECAUSE POINTS 
IN THE BAG AND THEY HAVE A HUGE 
AMOUNT OF GAMES TO PLAY AND 
RANGERS MAY BE JUST GETTING TIRED 
ALTHOUGH I SAID YOU SHOULDN'T GET 
TIRED EARLIER ON THERE ARE LOT 
OF GAMES TO PLAY WITH A CUP FINAL 
AT THE END OF IT 
BUT I THINK 
THEY'VE GOT PLAYERS THEY CAN BRING 
OFF THE BENCH AND GOALSCORERS WHO 
DIDN'T START THE OTHER NIGHT AND I 
THINK RANGERS WILL GET THE THREE 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE UEFA CUP 
FINAL 
O. K. NOW THE WOMEN'S F. A. CUP FINAL FINAL THIS BANK HOLIDAY WEEKEND 
NOW THE CHAMPIONSHIP REACHES ITS 
CLIMAX TOMORROW STOKE ARE 
FAVOURITES TO JOIN WEST BROM IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE 
BUT CRYSTAL PALACE ARE HOPING TO 
COMPLETE A REMARKABLE RISE UP THE 
TABLE 
IT'S HIS CLUB BORN DOWN THE ROAD 
AND AN ACADEMY GRADUATE CLINTON 
MORRISON IS BACK AND ATTEMPTING TO 
LEAD THE EAGLES TO TKWHRORY 
BURNLEY AT GLORY 
BURNLEY AT HOME IT COULDN'T BE ANY 
BETTER 
YES ABSOLUTELY WE WERE BETTER DISAPPOINTED TO LOSE LAST WEEK BUT 
WE HAVE TO TAKE IT AS IT COMES 
IF YOU HAD SAID WE WOULD NEED THE 
LAST GAME OF THE SEASON TO GO UP 
EARLIER IN THE SEASON NO ONE WOULD 
HAVE BELIEVED IT 
DESPITE A 
DIFFICULT START THE ARRIVAL OF 
NEIL WARNOCK HAS BEEN THE CATALYST 
FOR PALACE'S SURGE UP THE TABLE 
HE'S OVERSEEN A CHANGE AT THE CLUB 
WHICH TOOK A BIT OF GETTING USED TO 
IF YOU DON'T TRAIN WELL HE WON'T 
PUT YOU IN THE TEAM AND THEN ON 
THE SATURDAY IT DON'T MATTER IF YOU 
MAKE FEW MISTAKES AS LONG AS YOU 
PLAY WELL 
SO YOU'VE HAD TO CHANGE 
YOUR TRAINING TACTICS 
YES I LIKE 
TO MUCK AROUND AND HE SAID I WASN'T 
OBTAINING HARD ENOUGH TO BE IN 
THINKS TEAM SO I SAID FAIR 
ENOUGH I'D BETTER GET MY HEAD DOWN 
AND SINCE HE'S COME IN AND DONE 
THAT EVERYONE'S BEEN GRAEFPLT IT IT THE SEASON HAS HAD GREAT 
THE SEASON HAS HAD ITS MOMENTS THE 
STRIKER ULTIMATELY LEFT SAINT ANDREWS 
FRUSTRATED AND NOW HE WANTS TO 
PROVE HIS QUALITY OF PLAY WITH 
PALACE 
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT PALACE MANAGED TO PLAY MY PART AND SCORE A 
FEW GOALS BUT OBVIOUSLY I'D LOVE 
TO GO BACK TO THE PREMIERSHIP WITH 
PALACE 
YOU'VE BEEN TEXTING ME A PALACE CERTAIN QUESTION WHICH I DON'T 
WANT TO ASK YOU YOU'RE CATCHING UP 
WITH THE ALL TIME GOALSCORER AT 
CRYSTAL PALACE ONE BEHIND ME AND 
UP WITH WRIGHTY 
THEY ARE THE TWO I 
WANT TO CATCH 
BRIGHTY IS ALSO ONE PERSON I'D LOVE 
TO CATCH AND WRIGHTY AS WELL BUT 
I'M DEFINITELY TRYING TO GO FOR THE 
BRIGHTY ONE 
A HAT TRICK AND 
BRIGHTY ONE A HAT TRICK AND A COUPLE MORE IN THE FINALS 
AND IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT SEASON 
WHAT ABOUT CRYSTAL PALACE CAN THEY 
GET THROUGH 
I THINK THEY'VE GOT A 
CHANCE THEY'VE PLAYED 
EXCEPTIONALLY WELL THROUGHOUT THE 
SEASON AND THE MANAGER HAS 
CERTAINLY CHANGED THE MENTAL 
ATTITUDE OF THE PLAYERS HE'S 
BLOODED A FEW KIDS WHO HAVE COME 
THROUGH FOR HIM AND MIX THAT WITH 
THE SENIOR PLAYERS AND THE TEAMS 
FIRING L. THINK THEY HAVE A GOOD CHANCE 
LET'S LOOK AT THE PLAY OFF CHANCE POSITIONS POSITIONS HOW DO YOU SEE THIS ONE LAWRO YOU 
HAD YOUR MONEY ON WOLVES A SHORT 
TIME AGO 
YES I THINK THEY'VE 
MISSED OUT IF YOU HAD TO PLAY ONE 
OF THE BOTTOM THREE TO GUARANTEE 
YOUR PROMOTION TO THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE AND I KNOW WHAT I'D BE 
WANTING 
YOU'D PICK LEICESTER WANTING THEY'VE DONE ALL RIGHT AGAINST SOME 
AT THE TOP 
BUT YOU'RE LOW 
A POINT 
COULD DO US 
YES BUT I THINK 
YOU'RE DOWN 
YOU'RE DOING IT ON 
PURPOSE 
YES YOU'RE NOT EVEN TWENTY FIRST PURPOSE AT THE MOMENT AND SOUTHAMPTON ARE 
AT HOME AGAINST SHEFFIELD UNION 
UNIONED 
BUT THEY NEED TO GET INTO UNIONED THE PLAYOFFS 
BUT I THINK YOU'RE 
GONE WE'VE BOUGHT YOU SOME HANKIES 
FOR NEXT WEEK 
I CAN'T WAIT 
IN LEAGUE ONE SWANSEA HAVE SECURED 
THE TITLE AFTER LEEDS LOST THEIR 
APPEAL AGAINST A FIFTEEN POINT PENALTY 
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON 
THE TWO UNSUCCESSFUL SIDES WILL 
JOIN SOUTHEND AND LEEDS IN THE 
PLAYOFFS PLAYOFFS IT'S INTERESTING THAT BLOW FROM 
FOR LEEDS WILL THAT AFFECT THE 
PLAYERS 
NO I DON'T 
THINK SO AND I PLAYERS THINK IT IS THE RIGHT DECISION AS 
WELL OTHERWISE YOU'D HAVE TO GIVE 
LOADS OF POINTS BACK TO OTHER TEAMS 
OBVIOUSLY NOTTINGHAM FOREST COULD 
GO UP AS WELL FROM FOOTBALL'S 
POSITION IF THEY HAD NOTTINGHAM 
FOREST AND LEEDS IN THE FINAL THAT 
WOULD BE UTOPIA BUT THAT WOULD BE 
TAKING AWAY FROM SOUTHEND AND 
CARLISLE 
NOW WE GO TO OLD TRAFFORD CARLISLE THE GOAL HAS GONE TO MANCHESTER 
UNITED RONALDO GOAL THIRTY NINE OF 
PROLIFIC SEASON HE CUT INSIDE 
WITH LUCAS NEILL ON HIS BACKSIDE 
AND CUT IN WITH A SHOT 
A BIT OF NERVEY START AS WELL 
THREE MINUTES 
YOU EXPECT THEM TO 
HOLD ON TO THAT 
AND GET ANOTHER 
TWO OR THREE 
BACK TO THE LEAGUE AT THE BOTTOM 
OF LEAGUE ONE AFTER SIX STRAIGHT 
WINS BORN MOUTH HAVE GIVEN 
THEMSELVES A CHANCE OF AVOIDING 
RELEGATION RELEGATION WE'VE BEEN DOWN TO THE SOUTH COAST 
TO MEET THOSE HOPING TO PULL OFF 
THE GREAT ESCAPE 
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO BOURNEMOUTH 
WERE FOURTEEN POINTS ADRIFT OF SAFETY 
BUT SIX SUCCESSIVE VICTORIES LATER 
THEY COULD SAVE THEMSELVES IF THEY 
CAN WIN CHASING CARLISLE AROUND 
AND THEY'VE SPENT MOST OF THE YEAR 
UNDERSTAND A FINANCIAL CLOUD JUST JUST AFTER THE NEW YEAR WE GOT HIT WITH 
ADMINISTRATION IT WAS AN 
INEVITABILITY IT HAD TO HAPPEN FOR 
THE LONG TERM FUTURE OF THE 
FOOTBALL CLUB AND WITH THAT GAME 
POINT DEDUCTIONS SO WE WERE LEFT 
NEEDING SNOOKERS IF YOU LOOKED AT 
THE BIGGER PICTURE YOU WOULD HAVE 
BEEN FED UP SO WE HAD TO BREAK IT 
DOWN AND SLOWLY AND SURELY FOUND A 
BIT OF FORM 
ALL WE WERE INTERESTED IN 
INITIALLY WAS WHAT WAS GOING ON 
OFF THE FIELD BECAUSE WE'D WRITTEN 
OFF THE TEAM'S CHANCES BUT AFTER 
THREE OR FOUR GAMES WE THOUGHT 
HANG ON THERE MAY BE SOMETHING 
GOING ON HERE 
WITH THE CLUB GOING 
INTO ADMINISTRATION IT'S BROUGHT 
THE LADS CLOSER TOGETHER AND WE 
HAVE NO FEAR NOW 
AN ASTONISHING 
END AGAINST SWANSEA THEY MANAGED 
TO SCORE TWICE IN INJURY TIME L. 
THINK THAT MAY HAVE BEEN THE 
PLATFORM TO CARRY THEM THROUGH THE 
LAST THREE GAMES 
WHILE THE PLAYERS 
HAVE BEEN DOING THEIR STUFF ON THE 
PITCH THERE HAVE BEEN FEVERISH 
EFFORTS TO SAVE THE CLUB THE 
CHAIRMAN RECENTLY PAID EIGHT THOUSAND OF 
HIS OWN MONEY TO PAY THE STAFF'S 
WAGES BUT COME THE BIG DAY WELL 
ELG BE ELSEWHERE 
HE ELSE HE'LL 
BE ELSEWHERE HE INADVERTENTLY MADE 
ARRANGEMENTS FOR HIS DAUGHTER TO 
GET MARRIED EARLIER IN THE SEASON 
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD 
BE SUCH AN IMPORTANT DATE 
BUT YOUR FAMILY COMES FIRST 
THEY HAVE A MASSIVE SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILE ROUND 
TRIP AND THEY HAVE TO HOPE THAT 
THEIR RIVALS SLIP UP NO PRESSURE 
COME FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY AS LONG AS WE KNOW WE'VE 
PUT OUT THE BEST PERFORMANCE WE CAN 
THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO IT'S IN THE 
LAP OF THE GODS 
IF WE START TAKING 
OUR EYE OFF THE BALL AND WATCH WHAT 
OTHER PEOPLE WILL DO THAT WILL 
START HURTING AT THE END OF THE 
DAY IF WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF OUR 
OWN JOB IT WILL BE POINTLESS WHAT 
ANYBODY ELSE DOES 
CARLISLE WILL BE 
TOUGH AND THEY'RE AT HOME WITH A 
FULL CROWD AND PEOPLE WILL BE 
EXPECTING THEM TO WIN AND HOPEFULLY 
WE CAN GO AND SPOIL THE PARTY IF IF WE CAN GET A POSITIVE RESULT IT 
WILL SHORTER BUT IT IS A LONG 
WAY TO COME HOME IF YOU GET NOTHING 
WHAT A DAY IT WILL BE TOMORROW 
IT'S NOTHING SHORT OF A MINOR 
MIRACLE WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN THE 
LAST SIX GAMES AND SUCH IS THE 
FIXTURE GOD THAT THEY GO TO 
CARLISLE THAT'S JUST THE STRANGE 
THING ABOUT IT BUT IT IS A 
FANTASTIC STORY AND YOU WOULDN'T 
WANT TO TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM 
CARLISLE BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT THREE 
PROMOTIONS IN FOUR YEARS BUT IF 
BOURNEMOUTH STAYED UP THAT WOULD 
BE MAGNIFICENT 
WHERE HAS THAT FORM 
COME FROM SIX WINS IN THE LAST SIX 
GAMES UNBELIEVABLE 
JOHN BOND GAVE ME MY FIRST FREE 
TRANSFER 
GOOD MANAGER 
AND WHAT TRANSFER ABOUT THE CHAIRMAN HE HAS TO 
ATTEND HIS DAUGHTER'S WEDDING AND 
NOT GO TO THE GAME 
I CAN'T BELIEVE 
HE'S NOT GOING TO THE GAME WELL 
THERE WAS NOTHING BIG RIDING ON IT 
AT THE TIME BUT I'M SURE HIS 
DAUGHTER WILL LET HIM SNEAK OFF FOR 
HALF AN HOUR 
AND THINGS ARE INTERESTING IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE 
LIVERPOOL ARE IN THE HUNT AND VILLA 
ARE LOOKING TO REPLACE EVERTON IN 
FIFTH FIFTH DO UNDERSTAND IS FRUSTRATIONS OF 
LIVERPOOL 
YES LIVERPOOL HAVE SENT LIVERPOOL A FAX ASK FOR A TRANSFER OF BARRY 
WHY DON'T MANAGERS SPEAK TO EACH 
OTHER ANY MORE WHY DON'T THEY 
TALK 
ABSOLUTELY THE GOOD THING TALK ABOUT THAT IS VILLA ARE IN A GOOD 
POSITION NOW A FEW YEARS AGO AND 
THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO SELL BARRY 
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW NOW 
IS HE THE 
KIND OF PLAYER THAT LIVERPOOL NEED 
I'M NOT SURE BUT THAT WOULD SAY TO 
ME THAT ALONSO WOULD BE GOING IF 
BARRY SIGNS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY TOMORROW WE'RE AT 
AND AS 
THE LEAGUE SEASON COMES TO A CLOSE 
SO DO TWO STRIKESERS HERE'S DION 
DUBLIN AND TEDDY SHERINGHAM 
SO TAKE THE PHOTOGRAPHS AND STILL 
FRAMES IN YOUR MIND 
HANG THEM ON A SHELF AND PUT 
THEM UP IN GOOD TIME 
LOTS OF MEMORIES 
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH 
IT WAS WORTH ALL THE WHILE 
IT'S SOMETHING UNPREDICTABLE 
BUT IN THE END THERE'S RIGHT 
I HOPE YOU HAVE THE TIME OF YOUR 
LIFE
