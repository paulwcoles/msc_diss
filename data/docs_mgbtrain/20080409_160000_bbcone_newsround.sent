DEFINITELY BE AN ENGLISH TEAM IN 
NEXT MONTH'S CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL 
LIVERPOOL AND CHELSEA SUPPORTERS 
ARE CELEBRATING TODAY AFTER THEIR 
SIDES EARNED THE RIGHT TO PLAY EACH 
OTHER IN THE SEMI FINAL SONALI WAS 
IN LIVERPOOL AND I HEADED TO 
STAMFORD BRIDGE TO GET THE FANS' 
REACTION REACTION LIVERPOOL HAVE DONE IT AGAIN 
THEY'VE GOT THEMSELVES A PLACE IN 
THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI FINAL 
LAST NIGHT HERE AT ANFIELD THEY 
BEAT ARSENAL FOUR TO TWO HERE'S HOW IT 
WENT DOWN 
AFTER A BAD START GOALS FROM 
HYYPIA AND TORRES PUT LIVERPOOL IN 
CONTROL THEN IT SO NEARLY WENT 
WRONG THIS GOAL FROM ADEBAYOR 
WOULD HAVE PUT ARSENAL THROUGH BUT 
SECONDS LATER LIVERPOOL SEALED THE 
TIE WAS IT A PENALTY WELL THE REF 
SAID IT WAS AND STEVEN GERRARD 
SMASHED LIVERPOOL INTO THE SEMI 
FINALS 
IT WAS BRILLIANT WHEN FINALS STEVEN GERRARD TOOK THE PENALTY 
EVERYONE WENT QUIET AND YOU COULD 
FEEL THE ATMOSPHERE 
I THOUGHT WE 
WERE GOING TO WIN AND ADEBAYOR 
SCORED AND DANIELLI STARTED CRYING 
IT WAS GREAT THE ATMOSPHERE WAS 
EXCELLENT 
I'M REALLY STARTED EXCELLENT CRYING CRYING SO CELEBRATIONS IN LIVERPOOL AND 
DELIGHT HERE IN WEST LONDON TOO AS 
MICHAEL BALLACK AND FRANK LAMPARD 
BOTH FOUND THE BACK OF THE NET TO 
KNOCK TURKISH SIDE FENERBACHE OUT 
OF THE COMPETITION MEANING THERE 
ARE LOTS OF HAPPY CHELSEA FANS 
AROUND STAMFORD BRIDGE TODAY I I THINK WE CAN GO TO THE WAY AND GET 
TO THE FINAL AND PROBABLY BEAT

I THINK CHELSEA WOULD BARCELONA BEAT LIVERPOOL BECAUSE THEY BEAT US 
THE LAST FEW TIMES AND WE ARE THE 
BEST TEAM 
WE ARE GOING TO BEAT 
LIVERPOOL BECAUSE OUR TEAM IS ON 
FIRE THEY ARE GOING DOWNHILL 
TONIGHT MAN UNITED TAKE ON ITALIAN

LEAGUE FINAL 
MORE STORIES THE MUM OF NINE YEAR 
OLD SHANNON MATTHEWS APPEARED IN 
COURT THIS MORNING IN CONNECTION 
WITH HER DAUGHTER'S DISAPPEARANCE 
SHANNON WAS MISSING FOR TWENTY FOUR DAYS 
BEFORE SHE WAS FOUND NEAR HER HOME 
IN DEWSBURY HER MUM KAREN MATTHEWS 
HAD TO GO TO COURT BECAUSE POLICE 
THINK SHE MAY HAVE KNOWN MORE ABOUT 
WHERE SHANNON WAS THAN SHE CLAIMED 
SHE DID 
IT'S A BIG DOH FOR SIMPSONS FANS 
IN THE SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRY OF 
VENZEULA THE POPULAR CARTOON SHOW 
HAS BEEN BANNED A T. V. STATION HAD 
BEEN SHOWING IT BUT THEY'VE NOW 
DECIDED IT'S NOT SUITABLE FOR 
CHILDREN TO WATCH 
AND IT'S AMAZING WHAT YOU CAN DO 
WITH FEW PLASTIC BAGS AND A LOAD 
OF HOT AIR A NEW YORK ARTIST 
CREATED THIS INFLATABLE ART BY 
ATTACHING BAGS TO AIR VENTS FROM 
THE UNDERGROUND WHEN A TRAIN 
RUMBLES PAST THE BAGS FILL WITH HOT 
AIR AND INFLATE INTO THE SHAPES OF 
ANIMALS GENIUS 
NEXT WE'VE BEEN TALKING LOADS 
ABOUT FOOTBALL ALREADY AND IF 
YOU'RE A BIG FOOTIE FAN YOU 
PROBABLY OWN A REPLICA JERSEY OF 
YOUR FAVOURITE TEAM JUST LIKE THE 
ONES YOUR FAVOURITE PLAYERS WEAR ON 
THE PITCH BUT NOW REPLICA SHIRTS 
FOR KIDS WHO SUPPORT GLASGOW 
RANGERS AND CELTIC ARE CHANGING 
BUT WHY LAURA'S BEEN FINDING OUT 
KNOCKING ABOUT AFTER SCHOOL THESE 
KIDS IN GLASGOW LOVE THEIR FOOTIE 
AND THEY LOVE LOOKING LIKE THEIR 
FAVOURITE PLAYERS WHEN THEY PLAY 
THIS LOT ARE MASSIVE RANGERS FANS 
AND MOST OF THEM OWN REPLICA 
SHIRT BUT NOW SOME KIDS' SHIRTS 
ARE GOING TO CHANGE CARLING IS 
TYPE OF BEER AND THE COMPANY THAT 
MAKES IT SPONSORS BOTH RANGERS AND 
CELTIC BUT BECAUSE KIDS AREN'T 
ALLOWED TO DRINK ALCOHOL THE 
COMPANY HAS DECIDED TO TAKE THEIR 
NAME OFF CHILDREN'S SHIRTS TO TRY 
AND HELP STOP UNDER AGE DRINKING 
DRINKING TOO MUCH ALCOHOL IS BIG 
PROBLEM FOR LOTS OF PEOPLE IN THIS 
COUNTRY AND IT'S NOT JUST ADULTS 
IN FEBRUARY HALF TERM POLICE 
CONFISCATED MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND LITRES 
OF ALCOHOL FROM UNDER AGE KIDS A 
QUARTER OF THEM UNDER FIFTEEN IT'S 
SOMETHING EVERYONE'S TAKING VERY 
SERIOUSLY AND IT'S HOPED THAT 
TAKING ALCOHOL SPONSORS' NAMES OFF 
SHIRTS WILL HELP 
CELTIC AND RANGERS FANS WILL START 
NOTICING THE DIFFERENCE ON THEIR 
SHIRTS FROM NEXT SEASON BUT IT'S 
SOMETHING THAT'S EVENTUALLY GOING 
TO AFFECT LOADS OF OTHER TEAMS TOO 
OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS ALCOHOL 
COMPANIES HAVE AGREED TO TAKE THEIR 
NAMES OFF ALL KIDS' SHIRTS 
NEXT TO SUCCESS STORY FOR AN 
INJURED SEAL SIX MONTHS AGO GILLY 
WAS SO ILL SHE ALMOST DIED BUT NOW 
SHE'S BACK WHERE SHE BELONGS 
LIZO'S GOT THE STORY 
GILLY THE SEAL WAS FOUND ABANDONED 
AND VERY SICK OFF THE COAST OF 
SCARBOROUGH IN NORTH YORKSHIRE 
JUST A SMALL PUP AT THE TIME GILLY 
WAS SO BADLY INJURED THERE WAS 
LITTLE CHANCE SHE'D EVER GET BETTER 
BUT SHE WAS RESCUED BY THE LOCAL 
SEA LIFE CENTRE WHO NURSED HER BACK 
TO HEALTH 
IT IS FANTASTIC TO SEE 
THE CHANGE IN GILLY'S HEALTH FROM 
BE IN TOUCH AND GO TO BE IN THIRTY SEVEN 
KILOS AND READY TO GO BACK INTO THE 
WILD 
NOW IT'S TIME FOR GILLY TO WILD SAY GOODBYE TO THE RESCUE TEAM 
SHE'S STARTING A NEW LIFE BACK AT 
SEA THE OTHER SEALS AT THIS COLONY 
ON THE LINCOLNSHIRE COAST WEREN'T 
RUSHING TO MEET THE NEW ARRIVAL 
THAT DIDN'T STOP GILLY SHE SOON 
GOT IN THE WATER AND STARTED 
SPLASHING AROUND 
WE HOPE GILLY 
WILL INTEGRATE INTO THE COLONY AND 
BECOME PART OF THE SOCIAL GROUP AND 
GAIN SOME SKILLS THINGS LIKE 
LEARNING WHERE THE FISHING GROUNDS 
ARE AND JUST BECOMING A GENERAL 
PART OF THE SOCIAL GROUP AND AND VISITORS AT THE SEA LIFE CENTRE 
WERE HAPPY FOR HER TOO 
IT IS 
WONDERFUL TO SEE THEM BUT IN THE 
END THEY DESERVED TO GO BACK TO THE 
WILD 
YOU NEVER GET TO SEE THEM IN WILD THE WILD SO IT IS REALLY GOOD 
GILLY IS TAGGED SO THE EXPERTS CAN 
KEEP TRACK OF HER BUT HOPEFULLY 
SHE WON'T NEED THEIR HELP AGAIN 
HER CHALLENGE IS TO MAKE NEW 
FRIENDS AND GET USED TO LIFE AT SEA 
AND BY THE LOOKS OF THINGS SHE 
ISN'T WASTING ANY TIME
