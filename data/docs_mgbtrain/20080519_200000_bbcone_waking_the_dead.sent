HELLO MAX 
WHAT TERRIBLE THING ARE YOU LOOKING AT NOW 
OH NOTHING VERY EXCITING 
JUST SOME SALMONELLA 
FOUND IN THE GUT OF SOME GUY WHO CAME HOME DRUNK 
HEATED UP SOME CHICKEN LEFTOVERS 
HE DIED FROM IT 
YEP 
HEY 
I'M HERE 
ARE YOU READY YES I'M ON MY WAY OUT O. K. 
A SERB 
YEAH 
I HOPE HE KNOWS HOW LUCKY HE IS 
ME TOO 
IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX I VOLUNTEERED TO HELP WITH THE EXCAVATION OF MASS GRAVES IN BOSNIA 
AND I WAS SENT TO AN AREA IN THE MOUNTAINS 
ABOVE THE VILLAGE OF VINOCARI 
AT FIRST IT LOOKED LIKE A STANDARD MULTIPLE GRAVE 
THE PATTERN BY THEN WAS BECOMING CLEAR TO US 
THE SERBS HAD SYSTEMATICALLY TAKEN BOSNIAN MUSLIM MEN AND BOYS 
INTO THE WOODS EXECUTED THEM AND BURIED THEM 
THIS PARTICULAR GRAVE WAS UNUSUAL BECAUSE IT ONLY HAD THE REMAINS OF TWO PEOPLE 
I RECOVERED GOOD D. N. A. FROM THE VICTIMS AND I ESTABLISHED 
BUT I COULDN'T IDENTIFY THEM 
YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE THAT AT THE TIME THERE WERE NO PRE EXISTING D. N. A. DATABANKS IN THE REGION 
ALSO ON THE MOTHER'S CLOTHING 
I LOADED IT ONTO OUR NATIONAL DATABASE AND I FLAGGED IT UP AS ONE OF OUR COLD CASES 
AND YOU GOT A HIT YEAH EXACTLY 
HERE IN CENTRAL LONDON 
I'M DEALING WITH IT O. K. 
WHY THESE TWO 
I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP I COULDN'T SLEEP 
I TOLD YOU NOT TO WAIT UP FOR ME 
I WASN'T YEAH RIGHT 
YOU WANT SOME COCOA M. M. M. THAT WOULD BE NICE 
SO WHO IS HE 
THIS MAN WHO IS KEEPING YOU OUT LATE DO I GET TO MEET HIM 
MAYBE 
THE LOCAL POLICE GATHERED A D. N. A. SAMPLE FROM THE BLOOD ON THE CAR 
SO THAT'S OUR GUY YEAH SO HAD CONTACT WITH THIS FEMALE VICTIM 
HIS BLOOD WAS ON HER CLOTHING AND HER SHAWL 
RIGHT SHE'S A MUSLIM RIGHT BECAUSE OF THAT SHAWL THING 
HER SHAWL WAS TYPICAL OF THE LOCAL MUSLIM BUT HER SON WASN'T CIRCUMCISED WHEN HE WOULD'VE BEEN 
OH DEFINITELY LOCAL MUSLIM BOYS ARE CIRCUMCISED AT THE AGE OF EIGHT AS SOON AS THEY CAN RECITE THE KORAN 
HARDLY AN INCENTIVE TO LEARN IS IT 
IT'S AN IMPORTANT RITE OF PASSAGE FROM BOYHOOD INTO MANHOOD 
ANYWAY THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THE BOY IF INDEED HE WAS A YOUNG MUSLIM WOULD HAVE BEEN CIRCUMCISED 
EXACTLY SO WHAT MAKES THE SHAWL ON THIS WOMAN OUT OF PLACE 
WELL IT'S TRADITIONAL WHEREAS THE REST OF HER CLOTHING IS MODERN WESTERN EXPENSIVE 
NOT PEASANT CLOTHING SO IS SHE POSSIBLY NOT FROM THE AREA 
POSSIBLY 
THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES FLED THERE WHEN IT WAS DECLARED A SAFE ZONE 
SO OUR VICTIMS WERE FROM THAT SAFE ZONE MAYBE 
BUT THE DUTCHBAT CAMP WAS MAINLY MEN AND BOYS 
IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT THEY CAME FROM VINOCARI OR POTOCARI OVERFLOW AREAS 
WHERE THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE SAFE BUT THEY WEREN'T 
EXACTLY THEY WEREN'T SAFE THE SERBS LOADED WOMEN AND CHILDREN ONTO THE BUSES 
WHY THE HELL WOULD THEY WANT TO GET ON THE BUSES WELL READ THAT 
I OBSERVED AS A SERB SOLDIER TOOK A YOUNG GIRL AGED AROUND SEVEN 
INTO THE OPEN WHERE SHE WAS IN FULL VIEW 
HE THEN CUT HER THROAT IN FRONT OF US WE WERE UNDER ORDERS NOT TO INTERVENE 
THEY DID THIS TO PROVE TO THE REFUGEES THAT THE UN WERE POWERLESS TO HELP THEM 
AND HENCE THEY GOT ON THE BUSES 
SO DO YOU THINK OUR MOTHER AND SON WERE KILLED AT THE SAME TIME 
I DON'T KNOW BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THEY WERE KILLED BY TWO DIFFERENT GUNS AND THAT SHE WAS HOLDING HIM 
IN HER ARMS WHEN SHE WAS SHOT THE BULLET PASSING THROUGH HER BODY AND INTO HIS 
SO SHOT FROM BEHIND 
RIGHT IF THEY WEREN'T MUSLIM WHY WERE THEY PRETENDING TO BE IF THEY WERE BEING KILLED BY THE SERBS 
I DON'T KNOW CAN'T YOU TELL THE ETHNIC ORIGIN FROM THE D. N. A. 
YEAH BUT THAT'S THE POINT SERBS CROATS AND BOSNIANS ALL SHARE THE SAME ETHNIC TYPE THEY'RE ALL SLAVIC 
THE WAR WAS ABOUT ETHNIC CLEANSING IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE DOES IT 
IT MAKES A MOCKERY OF IT SO WHAT WAS THE MOTIVE IF THE CASE DOESN'T FIT ETHNIC CLEANSING 
HOW DO WE KNOW IT WASN'T ETHNIC CLEANSING WHAT DO YOU MEAN THEY THOUGHT SHE WAS MUSLIM AND SHOT HER 
YOU'RE SENTIMENTALISING AND PERSONALISING THIS INCIDENT 
WHAT WE'VE GOT IS TWO PEOPLE DEAD IN A GRAVE CONNECTED 
TO THIS MAN SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A POTENTIAL WAR CRIMINAL 
WE ARE SO CHECK THE HOSPITALS AND GET THIS C. C. T. V. FILE TO MY OFFICE 
GRACE WOULD YOU COME WITH ME PLEASE WOULD YOU MIND 
NO IS THIS ALL WE'VE GOT IT'S MUCH MORE THAN WE NORMALLY HAVE 
WELL 
NO I DON'T GET IT 
NO NO NO 
WHO DO YOU THINK IT IS O. K. O. K. O. K. RIGHT 
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WENT TO SEE THOSE HOMELESS KIDS POLICE OFFICER 
AT THE CONTAINERS YEAH O. K. AND ONE OF THEM ASKED ME 
WHO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR EH 
IF I WAS LOOKING FOR MY SON 
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR ANYONE YOU CAN ALWAYS SPOT A DAD LOOKING FOR HIS KID 
OH WELL I REMEMBER HER 
RIGHT WELL OH WELL BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S HER IS IT 
WELL I THINK IT IS YEAH IS IT

THE PROFILE OF THE OPIATE SUGGESTS SO AND WHERE WOULD THIS BE DONE 
NORMALLY ANYWHERE WITHIN THE GOLDEN CRESCENT AFGHANISTAN IRAN PAKISTAN 
THE COALITION FORCES KNOCKED ALL THAT OUT BUT THE TALIBAN STILL CONTROL THE HARVEST
