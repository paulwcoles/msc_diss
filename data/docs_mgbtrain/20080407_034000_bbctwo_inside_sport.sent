NEVER HAD AND DWAIN CHAMBERS ON HIS 
LATEST DANGEROUS LIAISON THAT IS 
TONIGHT ON INSIDE SPORT 
FOR WELCOME TO INSIDE SPORT WITH ME 
GABY LOGAN WE HAVE AN INTRIGUING 
MIX TONIGHT A RARE INSIGHT INTO 
ARSENE WENGER ON LIFE THE 
CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE AND THE SECRET OF 
HIS SUCCESS 
A MANAGER HAS A LOVE 
STORY WITH A CLUB AND HE HAS TO 
BEHAVE LIKE THE LOST BOY FOREVER 
BUT NOT BE STUPID ENOUGH TO BELIEVE 
THAT IT WILL NEVER END 
A GREATEST 
JOCKEY IN HISTORY A. P. MCCOY TALKS 
ABOUT OBSESSION DIETING AND DEATH 
IN HIS BID TO 
THE GRAND 
IN HIS BID TO WIN THE GRAND NATIONAL NATIONAL I WOULD CONSIDER MYSELF HAVING 
FAILED IF I DON'T WIN IT 
WE WONDER WHAT HIS NEXT MOVE WOULD 
BE THAT HE SAYS HE STILL HOPES TO 
RACE IN BEIJING SO IS DWAIN 
CHAMBERS'S RUGBY LEAGUE WORLD 
DESCENDING INTO A FARCE 
WE HAVE A 
STRATEGY IT IS ALL PLANNED OUT AND 
THESE ARE ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT 
HAS PRESENTED ITSELF L. WILL TAKE 
ONE DAY AT A TIME 
THE INVIGORATED BY HIS CHAT WITH 
ARSENE WENGER WE HAVE DES KELLY OF 
THE DAILY MAIL AND GLAD TO BE BACK 
ON DRY LAND THE INDEPENDENT'S 
STEVE BUNCE IT HAS BEEN ELEVEN YEARS 
AND HE IS STILL BESOTTED BUT HE IS 
WELL AWARE NOTHING LASTS FOREVER 
MORE THAN ANYTHING HE WANTS TO WIN 
THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE BUT HE IS NOT 
PREPARED TO PAY BIG MONEY FOR IT 
HE IS FRUGAL WITH HIS COFFERS HIS 
EMOTIONS RUN AWAY WITH HIM AT 
TIMESS BUT HE USES TECHNOLOGY TO 
ANALYSE THE GAME'S HIS LAUGHS THE 
GAME HE LOVES DES KELLY SAT DOWN 
WITH THE BOSS ARSENE WENGER 
WHEN I CAME THE FIRST TIME TO WATCH 
ENGLISH FOOTBALL I HAD THE FEELING 
PEOPLE WERE HAPPY AT THE GAME THEY 
COME THERE TO BE IN FIFTEEN YEARS 
YOU TRANSFORM AN OLD FASHIONED LEAK 
INTO A WATER LEAK BECAUSE YOU HAD 
AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH A WORLD 
LEAGUE I AM COMPLETELY LOGICAL 
WITH WHAT I THINK ENGLISH NATIONAL 
TEAM ENGLISH MANAGER ENGLISH 
PLAYERS WITH MY SUPPORT 
SOMETIMES YOU WERE REALLY HONEST 
WHEN YOU SAY I DIDN'T SEE BUT 
NOBODY BELIEVES ME ANY MORE WHEN I 
AM HONEST YOU DRIVE HOME ON 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND YOU THINK 
PEOPLE LOVE THIS CLUB TONIGHT THEY 
WILL HAVE A HAPPY NIGHT SOME WAY 
YOU FEEL YOU HAVE NOT LOST 
UNLESS YOU WANT TO SIGN THE 
CONTRACT 
WHEN YOU FIRST CAME OVER TO ENGLAND 
CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG YOU 
SEEMED MUCH LESS PASSIONATE AND 
MAYBE YOU BROUGHT SOME JAPANESE 
CONTROL IT HAS FELT LIKE YOU ARE 
MUCH MORE CONTROLLED ON THE 
TOUCHLINE BUT NOW YOU ARE MUCH MORE 
EMOTIONAL DID SOMETHING HAPPEN OR 
DID YOU DECIDE TO LET IT OUT MORE 
OVER TIME 
NO I FEEL WHEN YOU 
START A JOB SOMEWHERE YOU ALWAYS 
MORE RELAXED YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU 
HAVE A GOOD DISTANCE YOU HAVE NOT 
ALL THE PRESSURE THAT SLOWLY GETS 
INTO YOU AND SLOWLY HE WAS SUCKED 
IN THAT SO YOU GET SUCKED IN 
THAT I TRY TO CONVINCE MYSELF 
SOMETIMES THAT IT IS ONLY FORKBALL 
BUT THAT DOESN'T LAST A LONG TIME 
FOOTBALL I WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL 
IN WHAT I DO AND BECAUSE YOU WANT 
TO DO AS WELL YOU CAN AS PROBABLY 
ANYBODY WHO WORKS IN A JOB YOU 
KNOW YOU ALWAYS FEEL YOU DON'T 
DEDICATE ENOUGH TIME THAT BECAUSE 
YOU ALWAYS FEEL YOU COULD DO MORE 
YOU HAVE WIFE AND DAUGHTER YOU 
MUST HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING FAMILY 
YES I AM LUCKY ON THAT FRONT 
BECAUSE LIKE FOR EVERY PASSIONATE 
PEOPLE I BELIEVE PEOPLE SUFFER 
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE WITH THEM MARK MARK THE STRIKER YOU HAD IT MONICA SAID 
HE COULD NEVER FIGURE YOU OUT 
THERE WAS ALSO A PIECE OF ARSENE 
WENGER HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND 
THE STRIKING IN MONACO DO WE SEE 
THE REAL ARSENE WENGER WHEN WE SEE 
YOU'RE TALKING POST MATCH IN THE 
HIGH PRESSURE ENVIRONMENT DO THE 
ENGLISH PUBLIC RECEDE A REAL ARSENE 
WENGER GET 
NO WHEN YOU SPEAK IN A 
POST MATCH INTERVIEW NEWSPEAK AGAIN 
IT TO YOUR PLAYERS TO YOUR FANS 
YOU SPEAK AGAIN IT TO YOU FLAY US 
MOST OF THE TIME YOU HAVE PREPARED 
TO FACE THE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS AND 
NOT BE TOO ALARMIST SOMETIMES FOR 
PATCHES YOU CAN LOSE IT 
YOU CANNOT BELIEVE THAT NOBODY SAW 
IT FROM THE BRANCH THEY ARE BLIND 
HE DID NOT DESERVE TO BE SENT OFF 
THE REFEREE 
HAS CHEATED THERE IS A 
STRONG WORDS TO SAY THEY WILL 
LAWYER 
OF COURSE THEY LIED LAWYER ONLY HUMAN BEINGS 
TO SAY THEY 
WERE LYING 
YOU CANNOT ALWAYS CONTROL YOUR 
REACTIONS 
MONEY HAS NEVER BEEN REACTIONS YOUR MOTIVATION YOU HAVE OFTEN 
SAID THAT YOU HAVE NEVER WANTED 
THE CHEQUEBOOK THAT MANCHESTER 
UNITED OR CHELSEA HAVE BUT IT 
DOESN'T AFFECT YOUR TEAM'S 
PERFORMANCE IS IT BECAUSE IT 
DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE SATISFACTION 
OF 
THE JOB OF A MANAGER IS TO DO OF AS WELL IF I LOSE EVERY YEAR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
MILLION THE CLUB GOES NOWHERE THE 
CLUB IS BANKRUPT THE TARGET OF A 
REAL GOOD MANAGER IS TO ACHIEVE 
SUCCESS WITH WHAT IS AVAILABLE YOU 
WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT AT UWE 
CASTLE AT ASTON VILLA AT ARSENAL 
YOU WORK ONLY WITH THE FUNDS THAT 
YOU HAVE AT NEWCASTLE THE FUNDS 
THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED BY NATURAL 
POTENTIAL SPONSORSHIP GATES AND 
TEACH THEM MONEY T. V. MONEY FOR 
ALL THE REST SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED 
THAT WOULD CAUSED PROBLEMS IN A FEW 
PLACES 
MAYBE BUT AT THE MOMENT IT PLACES IS NOT LIKE THAT 
YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A GREAT 
ADVOCATE OF USING TECHNOLOGY DURING 
MATCHES IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THAT 
WILL HAPPEN NOW 
AGAIN I WOULD 
LAUGH F. I. F. A. TO HAVE MUCH MORE AND 
INNOVATIVE APPROACH I WOULD LOVE 
I BELIEVE WHEN YOU LOVE FOOTBALL 
YOU WANT JUSTICE TO BE DONE AS MUCH 
AS POSSIBLE AND YOU CANNOT ACCEPT 
THAT A GAME WAS WATCHED BY A 
BILLION PEOPLE EVERYBODY SEES A 
GOAL BUT THE REFEREE DOES NOT SEE 
THAT IS UNFAIR L. PERSONALLY THINK 
IT WOULD GIVE HIM GIVE THE REFEREE 
MORE CREDIT AND MORE RESPECT YOUR YOUR COUNTRY MAN SUGGESTED WE HAVE MORE 
ASSISTANT REFEREES ON THE GOAL LINE 
IS THAT THE ANSWER 
THAT COULD YET 
MORE CONFUSION AS WELL IF YOU NEED 
FIVE PEOPLE DO DECIDE WHY NOT 
REPLACE IT BY ONE MACHINE AND ONE 
GUY BEHIND THE MACHINE IT WORKS 
WELL IN RUGBY YOU COULD ALREADY 
GIVES BETTER EXAMPLES THAT 
CHEATING IS NOT REWARDED L. BELIEVE 
SOMEWHERE THAT ELITE FOOTBALL HAS 
THAT RESPONSIBILITY RATHER THAN 
SAYING MARADONA SCORED WITH HIS 
HAND AND HE GOT AWAY WITH IT WHY 
NOT SAY NO THAT WAS HANDBALL AND 
THE GOAL IS NOT GIVEN BUT YOU SEE 
THAT PEOPLE WIN THE WORLD CUP BY 
DOING THAT SO THEY CAN DO IT AS 
WELL INSTEAD OF MAKING FIFTY MISTAKES 
IF YOU MAKE ONLY TWENTY YOU ALREADY 
IMPROVED 
YOUR BACKGROUND I DON'T IMPROVED KNOW IF PEOPLE KNOW YOU HAVE A 
DEGREE IN ENGINEERING AND A 
MASTER'S DEGREE IN ECONOMICS IS 
THAT FASCINATION OF MEASURES AND 
NUMBERS IS THAT WHAT DRAWS YOU TO 
THE ANALYSIS OF PLAYERS 
ARE LIKE 
FOOTBALL AND I LIKE TO KNOW MORE 
I LIKE FOOTBALL L. DON'T KNOW HOW 
MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AND 
THE TEAM AS WELL ON THIS 
PROGRAMME THE PERFORMANCE INDEX 
FEW HAVE THE QUALITY OF THE PLAYER 
AND IS A PLAYER FOR EXAMPLE WINS 
MORE BALLS IN EVERY GAME THAN 
ANOTHER PLAYER HE IS DEFENSIVELY 
GOOD THAT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE 
WOULD YOU SIGN OR DROP PLAYER 
BASED ON MISINFORMATION 
I WOULD 
NOT SIGN A PLAYER ON THAT BUT I 
COULD DROP A PLAY ON THAT A 
PLAYER IT TRUE YOU ONCE STUDIED PLAYER A MATCH FOR SEVEN AND WAS 
I DON'T 
KNOW I AM CAPABLE OF EVERY CRAZY 
THING 
SEVEN HOURS 
AND EVERY THING CRAZY MISTAKE AS WELL IT IS AN 
OBSESSION THIS JOB AND EVERY 
MANAGER WILL TELL YOU THAT OUR JOB 
IS ALWAYS TO GO TO THE ROOT OF THE 
PROBLEM THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT 
THAT DID NOT A LOT OF ANALYSIS 
THAT DEMANDS A LOT OF ANALYSIS 
BEFORE YOU MAKE DECISION 
ARSENAL IS ON COURSE FOR ANOTHER 
DOUBLE DOUBLE ARSENAL ARE THE TONY ADAMS 
WHAT A WAY TO CLINCH THE ADAMS CHAMPIONSHIPS 
UNBEATEN FROM START CHAMPIONSHIPS TO FINISH 
IS THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE THE ONE 
TROPHY NOW THAT WOULD BE THE 
GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT 
YES BECAUSE 
THE CLUB HAS NEVER DONE IT AND I 
WANT TO ACHIEVE IT FOR THE CLUB 
AND WE HAVE COME VERY CLOSE THIRTEEN 
MINUTES CLOSE YOU KNOW AND WE 
WANT TO GET CLOSER NEXT TIME AND 
HOPE FOR THE NEXT TIME WE WILL BE 
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
YOU HAVE A BIG MONTH 
COMING UP OF APRIL YOU HAVE FOUR 
GAMES THREE AGAINST LIVERPOOL AND 
ONCE ONE AGAINST MANCHESTER UNITED 
IN JUST ELEVEN DAYS THAT WILL BE A 
GREAT TEST OF YOUR YOUNG SQUAD YES YES WE HAD A BIT OF A DIP AFTER THE 
BIRMINGHAM GAME L. FELT THAT NO 
MATTER HOW MUCH YOU WORK WITH YOUR 
TEAM IT ALWAYS NEEDS TIME TO HEAL 
ON THE SAME DAY WE DROPPED TWO 
POINTS SO WE WERE IN TURMOIL AND 
NO CLEAR CONSCIENCE FULL WHILE OF 
WHAT WAS HAPPENING HERE FOR A 
WHILE 
IT IS AS IF THEY HAVE LOST WHILE THE PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE AND EVERY 
CUP YOU COULD PLAY FOR IN ONE 
MINUTE MINUTE TWO MANAGERS IN EUROPE AT TOP CLUBS 
ONLY TWO HAVE ACHIEVED MORE THAN 
TEN YEARS' SERVICE YOURSELF AND 
CERAMICS FERGUSON IS THERE A 
QUALITY THAT YOU TWO MEN SHARE 
ALEX FERGUSON 
WE SHEER PASSION AND 
WHEAT ARE GIVEN THE TIME TO CHANGE 
THE TEAMS WE SHARE A PASSION YOU 
HAVE ALWAYS TO TRY TO MOVE FORWARD 
I BELIEVE THAT THE MANAGER IN THE 
MODERN GAME HAS TO PREPARE BETTER 
THAN A PLAYER 
YOU DON'T DRINK L. I PREPARE LIKE I WOULD PLAY THE GAME 
I DON'T L. SEE WHAT KIND OF PROMPTS 
ALCOHOL CAN CAUSE 
IN CHANGE OF 
PERSONALITY OR SIT THIS 
IF YOU PUT 
THE WRONG PETROL IN THE CAR IT 
WON'T GO VERY FAR AND FOR A HUMAN 
IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME I'M ALWAYS 
THINKING I HAVE TO PREPARE IF I 
PICK MY SUFFER SATURDAY I HAVE A 
CHANCE TO PLAY WELL PICK MYSELF 
ON SATURDAY OF COURSE I KNOW 
UNFORTUNATELY I AM NOT BUT I THINK 
THAT KIND OF ATTITUDE IS THE RIGHT 
ONE 
WHAT WITH THE STATISTICS SAY ONE IF YOU DID PICK YOURSELF 
I WOULD 
STAND OUT BUT IN A BAD WAY SHALL SHALL WE TALK ABOUT REFEREES 
WHAT IS 
SUBJECT 
YOU HAVE HAD AN SUBJECT INTERESTING RELATIONSHIP WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT HOW TECHNOLOGY COULD 
HELP OFFICIALS ISN'T MAKING 
MISTAKES PART OF THE GAME 
IT IS 
NOT PART OF THE GAME IT IS PART OF 
THE FACT WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS AND WE 
MAKE MISTAKES BUT IT IS NOT PART OF 
THE GAME IT IS THE PART THAT 
HUMANS BRING INTO THE GAME AND I 
BELIEVE WE HAVE TO TRY TO NOT PUT 
THEM UNDER PRESSURE BEFORE THE 
GAMES AS A MANAGER BECAUSE THAT IS 
VERY UNFAIR AND SOMETIMES THINGS 
ARE GOING ON BEFORE THE GAME THAT 
ON NEVER PUNISHED BY THE F. A. L. FIND 
THEM REALLY UNFAIR FOR EXAMPLE I 
HOPE WE HAVE A GOOD REFEREE I HOPE 
WE WILL NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE WE 
MADE LAST TIME FRANKLY BEFORE A 
GAME I DON'T KNOW WHO IS THE 
REFEREE I ALWAYS PRESUME THAT THE 
GUY IS HONEST AND TRIES TO DO HIS 
JOB YOU WHAT COMMITMENT AND SAY 
COMMITMENT COMMITMENT 
FRENCH WE ARE IN THE MANAGER'S 
OFFICE EXCUSE ME 
TO YOU EVER SEE YOURSELF ANYWHERE 
ELSE YOU'RE SO IDENTIFIED WITH 
ARSENAL DO YOU CAN'T REMEMBER 
IF THIS IS TRUE YOU SAID YOU COULD 
NOT REMEMBER LIFE BEFORE ARSENAL 
YES YOU GET SO DEEPLY INVOLVED L. 
ALWAYS SAY THAT A MANAGER HAS A 
LOVE STORY WITH THE CLUB AND HE HAS 
TO BEHAVE LIKE IT WILL BE A LOVE 
STORY FOREVER BUT NOT BE STUPID 
ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT IT WILL 
NEVER END IT COULD END AT ANY 
MINUTE BUT YOU HAVE TO BEHAVE LIKE 
IT COULD LAST FOREVER 
YOU HAVE 
BEEN LUCKY BECAUSE PLENTY HAVE HAD 
A ONE NIGHT STAND 
VERY LUCKY IN MY 
LIFE ON THAT L. THINK I MADE SEVEN 
YEARS AND NOW ELEVEN YEARS SO EIGHTEEN 
YEARS TWO CLUBS THAT IS QUITE 
LUCKY 
CAN YOU SEE BEYOND LUCKY MANAGEMENT MAYBE BE CHAIRMAN NOT NOT REALLY 
WHAT I PREFER IT IS IN THE MORNING 
TO BE ON THE PITCHES OUT THERE TO 
WALK OUT THERE AND SPENT TIME WITH 
MY PLAYERS THAT IS WHAT I LOVE 
HERE IN THE OFFICE IS NOT WHAT I 
LOVE LOVE WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THAT IS THAT 
PEOPLE GET TO SEE YOU BROUGHT OUT 
THE CHARISMATIC SIDE OF ARSENE 
WENGER THAT SO MANY PEOPLE DO NOT 
REALISE HE HAS BECAUSE HE LEADS SO 
MUCH BACK IN HIS POST MATCH 
SITUATIONS AND HE HAS 
REVOLUTIONISED THE PROFESSION HAS 
AND HE 
I'M NOT AN ARSENAL FAN BUT 
INTERVIEWING HIM ALMOST MADE ME 
REGRET THAT WE OFTEN SEE MANAGERS 
IN THE WORST POSSIBLE SITUATION 
WHEN THEY ARE ANGRY WHEN THEY HAVE 
EMOTIONS WE SEE HIM IN HIS 
EVERYDAY LIFE CHARISMATIC 
INTELLIGENT FUN TO BE WITH AND HAS 
A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE GAME 
AND MAN WHO HAS HAD TO WORK FOR 
YEARS TO GET THERE WE FORGET WHAT 
IT WAS LIKE THE FIRST FEW WEEKS 
WHEN HE CAME OVER ACCORDING TO THE 
PAPERS HE WAS WHO HE INHERITED 
A CHANGING ROOM LED BY TWO 
RECOVERING DRUNKS PAUL MERSON AND 
TONY ADAMS AND IT DIDN'T START OFF 
WELL THEN THERE WAS DREADFUL 
TABLOID SCANDAL THIS GUY HAD TO 
BATTLE THE FIRST YEAR WE FORGET 
THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD EIGHT OR 
NINE YEARS OF THIERRY HENRY OUR OUR EXPERIENCE OF FOREIGN MANAGERS WAS 
THE MAN AT ASTON VILLA NOW WE TAKE 
IT FOR GRANTED HE REVOLUTIONISED 
TRAINING METHODS HE BROUGHT 
SCIENTIFIC MEASUREMENT INTO THE 
GAME THAT OTHER MANAGERS HAVE 
ADOPTED NOW YOU'RE OUT OF FASHION 
IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A FOREIGN BOSS 
I REMEMBER ALEX ALLDIS AND SAYING 
WHAT DOES HE KNOW ABOUT THE GAME 
ALEX FERGUSON 
THEY SAID IT WON'T 
WORK SOME OF THE SENIOR PLAYERS 
SAID IT WON'T WORK AS THEY WERE 
REACHING FOR THE LAGER HE WAS 
BATTLING I AM AN ARSENAL FAN AND 
AT THE TIME HE WAS BATTLING AGAINST 
JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY 
DO ARSENAL 
FANS FEEL LIKE OTHER PEOPLE OF 
THAT THE ONE THING THAT LETS HIM 
DOWN IS THAT HE HASN'T BROUGHT 
THROUGH ENGLISH PLAYERS HE HAS HAD 
A CHANCE 
ARE YOU ASKING ARSENAL 
FANS OR GENERALLY 
DOES THIS TAKE 
THE EDGE AWAY FROM HIM BEING THE 
PERFECT PROFESSIONAL ROLE MODEL IF IF THERE WAS A X. ON ANY OF THE 
CATEGORIES IF YOU WERE TO MARK 
ARSENE WENGER ON IT WOULD ONLY BE 
THAT HE IS NOT ON HIS SECOND 
GENERATION OF YOUNG ARSENAL PLAYERS 
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE 
IT IS 
NOT HIS JOB IT IS THE F. A.'S JOB 
HIS JOB 
IS TO WIN FOR US L. ASKED 
HIM DURING THE INTERVIEW WOULD HE 
BE READY IF QUOTAS CAME IN IF 
SEPP BLATTER'S PLAN CAME THROUGH 
HE SAID ARSENAL WOULD BE READY L. 
DON'T 
THINK IT HAS BEEN EASY L. THINK HE LOOKS FOR RAW PACE QUICK 
FEET ATHLETICISM AND ENGLISH 
FOOTBALL HASN'T BEEN CHURNING THOSE 
OUT IT IS A MERITOCRACY 
ARSENAL ARE NOT AT WEMBLEY ON 
SATURDAY BUT WE ARE 
COMING UP MATTHEW PINSENT HAS BEEN 
FOLLOWING ANOTHER EXTRAORDINARY 
TWIST IN THE CAREER OF DWAIN 
CHAMBERS WHICH SAW HIM SPENDING 
THE DAY AT CASTLEFORD RUGBY LEAGUE 
CLUB SO WHAT ARE HIS CREDENTIALS 
IN TERMS OF FOOTBALL EXPERIENCE 
AMERICAN FOOTBALL LAST YEAR THE 
ONLY EXPERIENCE I HAVE RUGBY WAS 
WENT I HAD THE BALL IN MY HANDS THE 
OTHER DAY 
HE IS KNOWN FOR HIS 
OBSESSIVE WIN AT ALL COSTS 
MENTALITY EVEN BREAKING HIS BACK 
EARLY THIS YEAR HAS NOT STOPPED HIM 
BUT THAT IS WHAT IT TAKES TO THE 
NATIONAL HUNT JOCKEY FOR TWELVE 
SUCCESSIVE YEARS HE DOESN'T EVEN 
FEAR DEATH IN HIS QUEST FOR HIS 
FIRST GRAND NATIONAL TITLE BUT HAS 
SEEN MELLOWED NOW HE IS A BAD HE 
SHOWS OFF THE THINGS THAT MATTER 
MOST TO HIM HAS HE 
THE NEW MAN WHEN I'M RIDING I'M 
IN A WORLD OF MY OWN L. HAVE BEEN 
LIVING IN CARAVAN 
DO YOU WANT SUGAR 
I WOULD CONSIDER MYSELF HAVING 
FAILED IF I DON'T WIN THE GRAND 
NATIONAL 
LET'S START WITH BEING A DAD I 
WOULD IMAGINE A WORLD HAS CHANGED 
DRAMATICALLY 
A IT DOES IN THE DRAMATICALLY SENSE THAT WHEN YOU COME HOME FROM 
HAVING A BAD DAY AT THE RACES 
WHICH I DO A LOT YOU TEND TO 
FORGET IT A LITTLE QUICKER YOU SEE 
HER AND SHE IS SMILING AND LAUGHING 
NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD NO MATTER 
HOW 
BAD A 
DAY YOU HAVE HAD SHE 
DOESN'T CARE 
SHE IS VERY DEPRIVED 
ISN'T SHE SHE IS BEAUTIFUL 
THE DANGER ASPECT OF WHAT YOU DO 
HAVING A CHILD AND A LEGACY 
DOESN'T DIMINISH IN ANY WAY NOT NOT REALLY I KNOW I'M GOING TO GET 
INJURED AND HAVE BAD FALLS L. HAVE 
ALWAYS BEEN OF THE MENTALITY THAT 
NO MATTER HOW BAD I FALL I WILL 
ALWAYS GET UP 
YOU'VE SAID THAT YOU 
HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULD DIE 
FOR YOUR CALLS 
THAT IS A TERRIBLE 
THING TO SAY BECAUSE I HAVE HAD 
GOOD FRIENDS THAT HAVE DIED WOULD WOULD YOU WANT A CHILD OF YOURS TO DO 
THAT 
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT A THAT GIRL I HOPE HE'S NEVER GOES NEAR A 
HORSE HORSE THIS IS RUBY'S ROOM SHE COMES OVER 
FROM IRELAND AND STEALS ALL THE 
PRIZE MONEY 
SHE GETS A VERY NICE 
BED 
HE CHANGES HIS OWN SHEETS BED UNFORTUNATELY HE DOESN'T 
HE IS 
QUITE A SPOILED BEST FRIEND HE HE COMES OVER TWICE A WEEK HE STAYS 
HERE REGULARLY 
JUST LEAVE A BIG 
PILE OF SWEETS AND HE WON'T MAKE 
THE WAIT 
YOUR MENTAL ATTITUDE IS A LITTLE 
BIT DIFFERENT TO THE NEXT JOCKEY 
WINNING IS EVERYTHING LOSING IS 
NOT EVEN WORTH CONSIDERING 
I THINK 
ALL JOCKEYS HAVE THAT MENTALITY 
AND ALL SPORTS PEOPLE AT WHAT 
LEVELS I DON'T KNOW I'M ALWAYS 
ONE THAT LOOKS FORWARD TO WHAT I DO 
EVEN IF I RIDE A WINNER THE MINUTE 
I PASSED THE WINNING POST IT'S A 
SAD THING TO SAY BUT IT HAS GONE 
HOW LONG DOES IT LAST THE MOMENT 
I SUPPOSE IN TOTAL FIVE MINUTES 
YOU CROSS THE WINNING POST AND YOU 
HAVE THE ADRENALIN THE EXCITEMENT 
THE WALK TO THE WINNER'S ENCLOSURE 
YOU TAKE THE SADDLE OFF SIT ON THE 
SCALES PUT ON ANOTHER SET OF 
COVERS IT HAS GONE 
TEA WITH LOTS OF SUGAR IT IS 
SOMETHING I DRINK A LOT IN THE DAY 
I HAVE SIX OR EIGHT SUGARS IN MY 
TEA AT THE RACES 
I'M NOT GOING TO 
BUY YOUR DIET BOOK 
LET'S START WITH THE FOOD FRIDGE 
IT HASN'T GOT A LOT IN IT L. DON'T 
EAT MUCH 
CHICKEN GRASS DON'T WOULD YOU NEED THAT 
I COOK FISH A 
LOT 
JUST FISH L. WOULD HAVE LOT I WOULD HAVE VEGETABLES WITH IT 
NO POTATOES NO 
THERE IS THIS HERE THERE IS A 
CHOCOLATE DRAW EVEN IN A NORMAL 
PERSON'S HOUSE THERE SHOULDN'T BE 
A DRAW LIKE THIS 
THIRTY PER CENT FEWER 
CALORIES 
IT IS WHEN YOU GET CALORIES DEPRESSED DON'T 
GO 
AWAY UNTIL WE DEPRESSED HAVE SEEN THE VEGETABLE DRAWER 
LOOK AT THAT 
MY WIFE HAS BEEN 
DEPRIVED FOR THE LAST TEN DAYS THIS THIS IS THE FRIDGE OF A MAN WHO DOESN'T 
DRINK YOU ARE VERY HOSPITABLE MAN 
OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY THAT COMES HERE 
EITHER THAT OR YOU GET SENT FREE 
BOOZE ANYTHING INTERESTING IN THE 
FREEZER SPEAKING OF FREEZERS YOU 
HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO DO A BIT OF 
PRIMAL THERAPY 
I DID IT FOR TWO 
WEEKS WHEN I OPTED TO COME BACK 
AFTER MY BACK INJURY IT IS NOT 
PAINFUL IF YOU'RE LIKE ME AND YOU 
THINK IT WILL BE SOME GOOD THE 
FIRST FORTY FIVE SECONDS IT REALLY HITS YOU 
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A 
MINUTE YOUR BODY STARTS TO FREEZE 
YOU CAN FEEL YOUR SKIN GOING HARD 
WE CAN GO UP TO ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE DEGREES BELOW 
AND THE NEXT DAY IT WILL GO HIGHER 
AGAIN IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE COLOUR 
OF YOUR SKIN WHEN YOU COME OUT YOU 
ARE BRIGHT RED SO IT IS HELPING 
THE CIRCULATION IN YOUR BODY 
YOU ARE ABLE TO TALK TO US BECAUSE 
YOU ARE ON A BAN FOR OVER USE OF 
THE WHIP WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE 
PUBLIC CRY FOR THE BANNING OF 
WHIPS 
FROM BY RAISING POINTS OF WHIPS VIEW WITHOUT THE WHIP IT WOULD BE 
DANGEROUS WHY 
HORSES ARE LIKE DANGEROUS WHY HUMAN BEINGS THEY ARE NOT ALL MICE 
YOU CAN GET GOOD HUMAN BEINGS AND 
THAT HUMAN BEINGS IT IS BIT 
LIKE YOU WRITE SOME HORSES AND 
THINK IF IT WAS A HUMAN BEING IT 
WOULD BE IN PRISON YOU DO NEED TO 
CORRECT SOME HORSES SOMETIMES 
PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE 
IN RACING AND ESPECIALLY JOCKEYS 
BECOME JOCKEYS BECAUSE OF THEIR 
LOVE FOR HORSES 
YOU DON'T THINK 
YOU OWE THE USE THE WHIP OVER 
USE 
THE RULES ARE THE RULES AND USE SOMETIMES YOU OVERSTEP THEM BUT 
THAT HAPPENS IN EVERY WALK OF LIFE 
I HAVE HEARD ABOUT YOUR SPECIAL 
BATH 
THERE IS 
NOTHING SPECIAL BATH ABOUT IT OTHER THAN THAT I SPEND A 
LOT OF TIME IN IT L. AM LUCKY THAT 
I HAVE A LOT OF TELEVISION IN IT A 
LOT OF JOCKEYS SPEND A LOT TINED 
HOT BATHS IF YOU LOSE FOUR POUNDS 
YOU CAN GO RACING 
VERY CLEAN AS 
WELL 
YOU JUMP ON HERE AND YOU WELL GOING TO BATH AND AS SOON AS YOU 
GET OUT YOU HAVE LOST FOUR POUNDS 
HEY PRESTO 
IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN 
DRINKING IN THE BATH 
DO YOU EVER WORRY LONG TERM WHEN 
THESE DAYS ARE BEHIND YOU AND YOU 
ARE AN OLDER MAN 
I DON'T CARE 
NOT REALLY L. KNOW THAT I'M ONLY 
GOING TO BE ABLE TO RIDE HORSES FOR 
A CERTAIN LENGTH OF TIME AND I 
DON'T WANT TO LOOK BACK IN YEARS TO 
COME THINKING I COULD HAVE 
SQUEEZED A LITTLE BIT MORE OUT OF 
IT ONE OF THOSE THINGS WINNING IT THE GRAND NATIONAL 
YES I WOULD 
LIKE TO WIN THE GRAND NATIONAL IT 
IS THE SAME IN ANY SPORT L. HAVE 
BEEN LUCKY TO ACHIEVE A LOT THIS THIS IS YOUR THIRTEENTH ATTEMPT 
YES LUCKY 
THIRTEEN LUCKY THIRTEEN YOU NEED A LITTLE 
LUCK TO WIN THE GRAND NATIONAL IT 
IS ABOUT GETTING A GOOD POSITION 
KEEPING OUT OF TROUBLE TRYING TO 
GET YOUR HORSES AS CLEAR A PASSAGE 
THROUGH THE RACE AND AS EASY AS 
POSSIBLE IF YOU GET THE BEACH THE 
SECOND TIME AROUND AND YOU LOOK 
ACROSS THERE ARE EIGHT OR TWELVE OF 
YOU LEFT YOU THINK YOU HAVE GOT A 
CHANCE 
HOW MUCH NOW FOR YOU IS CHANCE BEING IN THE SPORT ABOUT THE RACE 
IS IT ABOUT THE ANIMALS IS IT 
ABOUT THE ADRENALIN THE PRIZE 
MONEY WHAT KEEPS YOU GOING AT THIS 
STAGE 
THE LOVE OF WHAT I DO WHEN STAGE THAT THAT IS THE LOVE OF THE HORSE 
THE ADRENALIN ALL THE WINNING I'M 
NOT SAYING I WOULDN'T ENJOY IT IF I 
WAS JUST COMPETING MAKING THE 
NUMBERS I NEED TO BELIEVE I'VE GOT 
A REALISTIC CHANCE OF WINNING WHEN WHEN YOU THINK YOU CAN'T WIN ANY MORE 
IS THAT WHEN YOU DECIDE IT IT WOULDN'T BE FOR ME 
AN INCREDIBLE 
MAN WHO IS UP THERE WITH THE LIKES 
OF TIGER WOODS TWELVE CONSECUTIVE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND YET REALLY 
HASN'T GOT THE KIND OF PUBLIC 
PROFILE BUT SOMEBODY OF THAT 
EVIDENCE SHOULD HAVE 
THAT IS WHAT 
JOCKEYS HAVE TO DEAL WITH THEY 
DEAL WITH LESS MONEY AND THAT LACK 
OF PROFILE THEY ARE THE FORGOTTEN 
HEROES OF BRITISH SPORT IT IS A 
SPORT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT FOR 
THE LAST FIFTY YEARS WE HAVE HAD THE 
GREATEST JOCKEYS IRISH JOCKEYS OR 
BRITISH JOCKEYS WE HAVE THE 
GREATEST YOU SEE AN INSIGHT INTO 
THEY WHAT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH 
THESE ARE GUYS ABOUT TEN STONE VERY 
FEW OF THOSE EVEN IN THE BOXING 
BUSINESS AT THAT HEIGHT FOUR 
INCHES TALLER THAN RICKY HATTON 
AND YOU SAW THAT WHEN HE WAS IN THE 
FREEZER IT IS THAT AMOUNT OF 
TRAINING IT IS O. K. WHEN YOU'RE TWENTY ONE 
AUG TWENTY TWO BUT ONCE YOU GET TO THIRTY FOUR AND 
HE DOESN'T EVEN DRINK FOR HIM TO 
GET DOWN AND PUT HIS BODY OVER 
THOSE FENCES 
NEVER MIND THAT I 
WOULD HATE TO FOLLOW HIM THROUGH AN 
AIRPORT X. RAY MACHINE BECAUSE HE IS 
SO FULL OF PLATES HE WOULD SET THE 
ALARM OFF EIGHT HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND RIDES A REAR 
A YEAR THE CASUALTY RATE IS 
INCREDIBLE CRASH TEST DUMMIES HAVE 
AN EASIER LIFE 
FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN HORSES 
COME OVER HIM HE HAS GOT THE REST 
OF 
THE FAILED TO JUMP OVER HIM AND AND THE MAD THING IS YOU MANY SURVIVE 
THOSE MASS CRASHES IF YOU HAVE BEEN 
IN THEM ALREADY THERE IS A BIT OF 
THE JEDI PROBLEM YOU NEED TO KNOW 
WHERE THE HORSES OFF YOU CAN 
IMAGINE TIME STANDING STILL AND THE 
HORSES ARE CRASHING DOWN 
HE IS SET 
TO RIDE AT THE WEEKEND AS WE SAID 
THE THIRTEENTH ATTEMPT AND YOU DO FEEL 
THIS WOULD BE A CAREER THAT 
WOULDN'T JUST BE COMPLETE WITHOUT 
AT GRAND NATIONAL TITLE 
IT IS THE 
SAME SCENARIO AS THE DERBY FRANKIE 
DETTORI NEEDED FOR THE COMPLETE SET 
AND THE PUBLIC WOULD NOT LIKE TO 
SEE HIM GO UP WITHOUT WINNING THE 
GREATEST STEEPLECHASE IN THE WORLD 
HE WON'T GO OUT UNLESS HE IS 
INJURED BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT 
HAPPENED TO SCUDAMORE WHO HATES 
BEING RETIRED HAD TO WALK AWAY 
FROM THE SPORT FOR THE SAME REASON 
DWAIN CHAMBERS FINDS HERSELF IN THE 
HEADLINES AGAIN NOT IN HIS BATTLE 
TO COMPETE AT THE OLYMPICS BUT IN 
HIS DEFENCE OF HER MOVE TO 
CASTLEFORD RUGBY LEAGUE JUST WHEN 
IT SEEMS HE IS CONTRACT HE MOVES 
ON AGAIN AND FOR THE SECOND TIME 
MOVES SPORT MATTHEW PINSENT HAS 
THE NEXT IN THE CRAZY WORLD OF 
DWAIN CHAMBERS 
THAT IS A NEW PERSONAL BEST FOR 
DWAIN CHAMBERS 
THERE MAY NOT BE 
A COMEBACK THIS IS MY OLYMPICS I 
HAVE GOT MY MEDAL AND I HOPE THERE 
IS THE CHANCE FOR ME TO MOVE 
FORWARD IF NOT I WILL HAVE TO 
PURSUE A CAREER ELSEWHERE LAST LAST TIME WE SAW DWAIN CHAMBERS HE WAS 
WINNING MEDALS ON THE TRACK NOW AT 
CASTLEFORD HE HAS STARTED ANOTHER 
NEW KOREA HE IS HERE FOR A MONTH'S 
TRIAL A NEW CAREER HE COULD BE 
PLAYING NEXT WEEKEND 
THE ONLY 
EXPERIENCE I HAVE HAD OF RUGBY WAS 
WITH THE PHOTO SHORT LAST WEEK 
PHOTO SHOOT ABUL BASICALLY SEE IF 
I CAN GRASP THE DIFFERENCE SPORT 
I WILL BASICALLY SEE CASTLEFORD CASTLEFORD HAVE LOST EIGHT GAMES IN A ROW AND 
ARE STRUGGLING FOR PLAYERS FOR NEXT 
WEEKEND EVEN FOR BEING IN THAT 
MUCH TROUBLE THIS IS A BIG GAMBLE 
WE LOST TWO PLAYERS YESTERDAY WITH 
INJURY DWAIN CHAMBERS WILL 
OBVIOUSLY BE AVAILABLE SO HE MAKES 
THIS TEAM 
THERE IS A REALLY GOOD CHANCE HE 
WILL BE PLAYING 
HE CAME THROUGH OUR DOOR FROM HIS 
SOLICITOR THERE WAS NO MONEY TO 
CHANGE CONTRACTS THERE IS NO CASH 
INVOLVED 
WHAT LEVEL OF A CHALLENGE INVOLVED IS IT TO PICK UP AGAIN HE IS SO NEW 
TO TO THEN PLAY IN THE SUPER 
LEAGUE 
NORMALLY YOU WOULD NOT GO LEAGUE DOWN THAT ROAD BUT BECAUSE HE IS A 
SUPREME ATHLETE AND MENTALLY TOUGH 
THERE IS A SLIM CHANCE HE CAN PULL 
IT OFF 
BUT YOU TAKE ON BOARD IT IS 
SLIM 
VERY SLIM 
DO YOU THINK THERE SLIM WILL BE PLAYERS ON THE OTHER SIDE 
WHO WILL WANT TO PROVE A POINT 
WITHOUT A DOUBT YOU MIGHT SEE SOME 
BIG BLOKES WHERE THEY NORMALLY ARE 
NOT JUST TO GET THEIR HANDS ON HIM 
WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE 
THE CLUB 
HAS ARE NO DRUGS POLICY BUT THERE 
IS NO SENSE FROM THEIR TEAM MATES 
THAT DWAIN CHAMBERS IS TAINTED 
GOODS 
NO HE HAS SERVED HIS TIME GOODS PART OF HIM BEING HERE IS TO 
EDUCATE PEOPLE IN THE AREA ABOUT 
NOT GOING DOWN THE SAME PATH HE HAS 
SO WE PLAY BY 
THE 
RULES NOW BUT BUT THE BRITISH OLYMPIC ASSOCIATION RULES STATE THAT ANY ATHLETE WHO 
HAS SERVED A DRUG BAN DRUGS BAN 
CAN NEVER COMPETE FOR TEAM G. B. AGAIN 
BUT WHEN IT STILL HOPES TO BE IN 
CHINA THIS SUMMER BUT DWAIN 
CHAMBERS STILL HOPES 
OBVIOUSLY I WOULD LIKE TO GET TO 
BEIJING BECAUSE I AM GETTING ON I 
WILL BE ON SATURDAY IT IS MAYBE 
MY LAST CHANCE BUT FOR NOW I WILL 
PURSUE THIS L. WILL USE IT AS AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO GET BACK UP TO SPEED 
GIVEN THAT I DON'T THINK MANY RUGBY 
LEAGUE PLAYERS WILL BE TRYING TO 
RUN AT THE OLYMPICS AND NO ONE 
RUNNING IN THE OLYMPICS WILL BE 
TRYING TO PLAY RUGBY LEAGUE WHAT 
MAKES YOU THINK YOU ARE QUALIFIED 
TO DO TWO PARALLEL TRACKS AT ONCE 
BECAUSE I AM OPTIMISTIC AND 
CONFIDENT I AM GOOD AT TRACK AND 
FIELD AND IF A PUT THE RIGHT ENERGY 
TO WHAT I'M DOING IN CASTLEFORD I 
BELIEVE I CAN DO THE RIGHT THING 
WHAT WILL BE CRUCIAL IS WHETHER 
DECIDE TO DO THIS OR CONTINUED TO 
GO TO BEIJING 
THE FOR IF THE 
APPEAL IS SUCCESSFUL HE WILL LEAVE 
RUGBY LEAGUE BEHIND IF THE 
APPEAL 
I WILL HAVE TO MAKE THAT APPEAL DECISION ONCE WE GO FORWARD UNTIL 
THEN IT IS EARLY STAGES 
HAS THERE BEEN A FORMAL APPROACH 
FROM U. K. ATHLETICS ABOUT DWAIN 
CHAMBERS COMING CLEAN 
THERE HAS 
BEEN NO FORMAL APPROACH THE 
COMMENTS OF JOHN SCOTT LAST WEEK 
WERE A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE 
HE SAID THE DWAIN CHAMBERS HAD NOT 
MADE CONTACT AND THAT IS NOT TRUE 
I PHONED JOHN SCOTT'S AUTHORS ON 
FRIDAY AND SAID WE WOULD LIKE TO 
MEET HIS OFFICE WE HAVE HAD NO 
RESPONSE WHATSOEVER 
A GIVEN THE 
CREDENTIALS OF THE PERSONAL SCHEME 
DWAIN CHAMBERS WILL BE QUITE 
WILLING TO COME CLEAN 
YOU CAN 
CUT THAT 
DWAIN CHAMBERS'S LAWYER WAS NOT 
WILLING TO EXPAND ANY FURTHER ON 
THE RELATION BETWEEN HIS CLIENT AND 
ATHLETICS BUT GIVEN UP THE OLYMPIC 
AMBITIONS THERE WERE SOMETHING I 
FELT NEEDED CLARIFICATION 
IT'S A QUESTION I HAVE ASKED YOU 
BEFORE DO YOU THINK IT IS 
POSSIBLE TO WIN AN OLYMPIC GOLD 
MEDAL WITHOUT USING DRUGS IT IS 
VERY POSSIBLE 
AND IT CAN BE DONE 
AS OF TODAY DWAIN CHAMBERS IS 
STILL HOPEFUL HE CAN RUN AT BEIJING 
AND HE HAS A ZERO DAY TRIAL WITH 
CASTLEFORD RUGBY LEAGUE HIS THIRD 
DIFFERENT SPORT THE ONE THING YOU 
CAN SAY ABOUT DWAIN CHAMBERS HE 
WOULD NEVER BACK AWAY FROM CHALLENGE 
THIS IS NOT A PUBLICITY CHALLENGE STUNT I AM DEADLY SERIOUS L. AM 
HERE TO FACE THE MUSIC AND DANCE 
AND TO SHOW THIS IS THE REAL DEAL 
IF I'M IN THE WORLD OF RUGBY LEAGUE 
TONIGHT I LOOK AT THIS WHOLE 
MERRY GO ROUND TODAY AND I THINK 
IT UNDERMINES MY SUPPORT AND THE 
SKILL NEEDED 
I WONDER I HAD BEEN 
SPEAKING TO SOME RUGBY LEAGUE 
PEOPLE TODAY AND I'M NOT SURE THEY 
FEEL THAT WAY SOME DO BUT NOT ALL 
OF THEM L. AM TAKING THE STANCE 
THAT NOT MANY PEOPLE I HAVE SPOKEN 
TO TODAY FROM MY CAB DRIVER TO MY 
WIFE I AM TAKING THIS STANCE THAT 
DWAIN CHAMBERS NEEDS TO RAISE HIS 
PROFILE HE WANTS TO TAKE ON THE 
FIRST EVER LEGAL CHALLENGE 
SO IT 
IS A PUBLICITY STUNT AND A SHAM 
IT IS NOT A STUNT THAT WILL BE 
RUNNING AROUND TRAFALGAR SQUARE 
NAKED 
HE IS NEVER GOING TO PLAY NAKED IT IS AN INSULT TO PROPER RUGBY 
LEAGUE PLAYERS 
YOU HAVE TO SAY 
STEVE YOU COULD DEFINE IT AS A 
STUNT IF HE HAS NO INTENTION OF 
HAVING A LONG TERM CAREER THEY THEY FOUND A PLATFORM TO HELP RAISE HIS 
PROFILE 
THIS HAS RAISED PROFILE CASTLEFORD'S PROFILE AS MUCH AS 
CHAMBERS AND THEY ARE SELLING 
SAILING RUGBY LEAGUE'S REPUTATION 
DOWN THE RIVER FOR THE SAKE OF SOME 
CHEAP HEADLINES 
THERE ARE TEN 
PLAYERS IN RUGBY LEAGUE WHO HAVE 
COME BACK FROM A DRUGS BAN AND EVEN 
MORE IN NEW ZEALAND IT IS NOT THAT 
UNCOMMON FOR PLAYERS 
THIS WHOLE 
FARRAGO TODAY IS BASED AROUND THE 
IDEA DWAIN CHAMBERS WILL BE A RUGBY 
PLAYER HE ISN'T HE CAN RUN ONE HUNDRED 
METRES IN UNDER TEN SECONDS AND THAT 
IS HOW LONG HE WOULD LAST IN A 
RUGBY LEAGUE MATCH 
WHAT ABOUT 
CASTLEFORD EIGHTEEN TEAMS ARE APPLYING 
FOR THE LICENCE FOURTEEN TEAMS WILL BE 
GIVEN SUPERLEAGUE STATUS WILL THIS 
UNDERMINE CASTLEFORD'S CHARTS 
IF I 
DON'T THINK CASTLEFORD WILL ON THIS 
FAVOURABLY 
CASTLEFORD CHANCE FAVOURABLY CHAMBERS IS NOT A PERSON YOU WOULD 
WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN YOUR SPORT 
PEOPLE IN RUGBY LEAGUE HAS SHOWN NO 
PROBLEM WITH IT 
I WILL TAKE YOU TO 
THE PAPERS THE BACK PAGE OF THE 
TELEGRAPH CAPELLO IS EMBROILED IN 
A CORRUPTION CASE THERE HE IS 
WITH AN ITALIAN POLICEMAN THERE 
THE CRIMINAL CHARGES HE COULD 
FACE 
THEY ARE RELATED TO FACE WITHHOLDING INFORMATION WITH REGARD 
TO AN AGENT THEY SHOULD IT DO IT 
ON HIS PRESS CONFERENCE IT IS LIKE 
GETTING BLOOD OUT OF A STONE FOR FOR THE F. A. SAYS IT IS A PRIVATE MATTER 
IT IS A VERY PUBLIC MATTER 
AT THE BOTTOM YOU CAN SEE A PICTURE 
OF MOURINHO APPARENTLY PORTER HAD 
BEEN INVOLVED IN ANY INVESTIGATION 
HE IS NOT MENTIONED IN THIS IT IS 
TO DO WITH MATCH FIXING IN THEIR 
CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE SEASON 
WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT GAME THIS 
WEEKEND 
I STILL REMEMBER THE DODGY WEEKEND GOAL THAT GOT THEM THERE BESIDES BESIDES RONALDO AUDITIONING FOR STRICTLY 
COME DANCING THERE DAVID BENTLEY 
SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THE WASTE OF 
TIME THE MATCH WAS AGAINST FRANCE 
BECAUSE PLAYERS HAD THEIR MINDS ON 
THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE 
HE IS RIGHT 
IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME WATCHING IT
