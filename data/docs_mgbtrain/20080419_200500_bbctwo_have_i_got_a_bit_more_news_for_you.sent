EXCELLENT GOOD 
RIGHT WE'VE GOT THAT ONE THEN 
YOU SPENT ALL THAT TIME GETTING RID OF BLAIR 
AND YOU'VE ENDED UP WITH BROWN 
I MEAN WHEN YOU SAID BLAIR WAS AN ELECTORAL LIABILITY 
DID YOU KNOW WHAT WAS COMING 
WE HAD A SORT OF RUMBLE 
BUT YOU SEE THERE WAS THE POPE THERE TALKING ABOUT GETTING RID OF BLAIR 
YOU CAN'T GET HIM IN AS LEADER NOW 
AND WHAT RUBS THINGS IN MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE FOR GORDON BROWN 
IS THAT THE POPE IS TONY BLAIR'S NEW BOSS NOW HE'S BECOME 
A CATHOLIC HAVE YOU ANY IDEA HOW LONG IT MUST HAVE TAKEN TO HEAR TONY BLAIR'S FIRST CONFESSION 
BUT NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN NOBODY'S RATINGS HAVE FALLEN FASTER IN HISTORY THAN NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN 
GORDON BROWN'S HAVE FALLEN FASTER 
YOU'VE FINALLY GOT BACK TO THE POINT THANK GOD THAN CHAMBERLAIN'S 
WHAT'S GORDON BROWN BEEN DOING THIS WEEK 
HE'S BEEN TELLING US NOT TO PANIC HE HAD A MEETING OF ALL THE BANKERS 
HE HAD BREAKFAST AND ASKED THEM TO PASS ON INTEREST RATES TO CUSTOMERS AND WHAT WAS THE RESPONSE 
UM NO WE WON'T NO 
AND THIS IS THE MAN THAT BOB AND CO SAID WAS THIS EXTRAORDINARY FINANCIAL GENIUS 
YES 
NO NEED TO RUB IT IN 
IT WAS OF COURSE THE COLLAPSE OF NORTHERN ROCK THAT SPARKED THE CRISIS IN THIS COUNTRY 
THINGS ARE STILL A BIT FRAUGHT THERE IF THIS LETTER SENT TO A VIEWER IS ANYTHING TO GO BY 
FROM THE NORTHERN ROCK BRANCH IN READING 
IT READS DEAR MRS. X. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LETTER 
EARLIER THIS WEEK GORDON BROWN FACED A GRILLING 
FROM I. T. N.'S POLITICAL EDITOR TOM BRADBY LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
I WANT FOR ONE SECOND TO REDUCE US TO THE LEVEL A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT IT THIS IS AN EGG 
AND FIVE MINUTES AGO IT WAS NOT IN MY POCKET EXPLAIN 
DID HE THROW IT AT HIM 
HE JUST WENT ON TO HAVE A FULL BLOWN MENTAL BREAKDOWN IN FRONT OF THE PRIME MINISTER 
WAS IT A HARD BOILED EGG DID HE OPEN THE EGG I DON'T KNOW 
BUT THERE IS A WAY OF TELLING DO YOU KNOW ONE FLOATS ONE DOESN'T 
I'M TALKING ABOUT SPINNING THEM 
THAT'S WITCHES ISN'T IT NO THEY'RE THE ONES YOU FLOAT IN WATER 
OH I SEE YEAH 
WHAT IF THE WITCH HAS A BOILED EGG IN HER POCKET 
GO UP AND DOWN THE WHOLE TIME THAT'S WHY THEY ABOLISHED IT 
WHAT HAPPENED TO DAVID CAMERON THIS WEEK WHEN HE WAS IN HASTINGS 
SOMEBODY SNEEZED YES THAT'S RIGHT 
THEN WIPED IT ON DAVID CAMERON'S BACK 
IT'S TRUE 
ON HIS BARE BACK NO HE WASN'T NAKED 
THAT'S ON CHANNEL FOUR 
AND A POLICE OFFICER FOUND THE MAN WHO'D DONE IT AND SAID 
LOOK I DON'T CARE IF THAT IS THE LEADER OF THE TORY PARTY 
YOU ARE GOING TO APOLOGISE 
YES IT'S ALL VERY HORRIBLE AND DISRESPECTFUL SHALL WE HAVE A LOOK 
THE SECOND THING IS TO DELIVER ON WHAT PEOPLE WANT 
REGENERATE THE TOWN CLEAN THE STREETS GET RID OF LITTER AND GRAFFITI 
AND MAKE IT A SAFE PLACE WITH A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE 
ATCHOO 
AGAIN THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS COUNTRY 
IN AMERICA THEY ASSASSINATE PEOPLE HERE WE WIPE SNOT ON THEIR BACKS 
FUNDAMENTALLY WE'RE BETTER PEOPLE 
ACCORDING TO THE INDEPENDENT WHAT ARE ONE IN TEN PEOPLE 
PLANNING TO CANCEL AS A RESULT OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH THE INDEPENDENT 
THEIR CREDIT CARDS 
NO WRONG HANDKERCHIEFS 
SO GORDON IS NOW IN THE STATES AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER 
BUT HIS ARRIVAL WAS OVERSHADOWED BY THE POPE'S VISIT WHO WENT TO THE AIRPORT TO MEET THE POPE 
GEORGE BUSH THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY I THINK 
HE WAS VERY THRILLED TO MEET THE POPE 
UNTIL THE POPE SAID PEACE BE WITH YOU 
THEN GEORGE DIDN'T REALLY GET THAT 
AND WHO WENT TO THE AIRPORT TO MEET OUR PRIME MINISTER 
WAS IT A CLEANER WE RANG THE U. S. STATE DEPARTMENT PRESS OFFICE EARLIER 
TO ASK WHO MET GORDON BROWN AT THE AIRPORT AND THEY SAID 
THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY PEOPLE HAVING TROUBLE TRYING TO IDENTIFY HIM WHAT DID MUGABE CALL HIM THIS WEEK 
A DOT YES HE DID THAT'S GOOD 
AN INFINITESIMAL DOT IN THE 
INFINITESIMAL DOT IN THE SOMETHING THAT'S WAR 
YOU CAN'T GET POINTS BY HEARING THE RIGHT ANSWER THEN GIVING A LONGER VERSION 
THAT WON'T WASH WITH ME HOW IS ONE SUPPOSED TO GET THEM THEN 
THAT WILL ALL COME IN TIME AS YOU GIVE THE RIGHT ANSWERS IN THE RIGHT MANNER AND IN A WAY THAT PLEASES ME 
SO WHAT HAS NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN GOT TO DO WITH ALL THIS WHY WAS HE IN THERE 
WE'VE ANSWERED THAT HAVEN'T WE YOU DIDN'T ANSWER IT AT THE RIGHT TIME DID YOU THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
HE SHOULD'VE ANSWERED IT IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE SAVED US A LOT OF TROUBLE 
ISN'T IT JUST BECAUSE YOU RECORDED THOSE CLIPS OVER A DOCUMENTARY THAT HAD BEEN ON THE TAPE BEFORE 
YOU ALLUDED TO THE CORRECT ANSWER 
GORDON BROWN IS NOW LESS POPULAR THAN CHAMBERLAIN WAS AT THE TIME OF HITLER'S INVASION OF NORWAY IN NINETEEN FORTY 
IN FACT HE'S LESS POPULAR THAN HITLER WAS AT THE TIME BUT 
IT'S THE TRAGEDY OF A MAN WHO'S WANTED A JOB FOR SO LONG AND HAS GOT IT AND FOUND OUT HE CAN'T DO IT 
AW YES IT IS SAD IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL TRAGEDY I KNOW 
THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY BALANCED IT'S A TRAGEDY THE MAN WHO DIDN'T WANT THE JOB CAN DO IT 
THAT'S BALANCE MUCH BETTER 
IT'S BEEN REVEALED THAT BROWN IS SPENDING AS MUCH ON SPIN DOCTORS AS TONY BLAIR 
HE'S RECENTLY SIGNED UP FORMER B. B. C. PRODUCER NICOLA BURDETT 
ACCORDING TO THE TELEGRAPH ANYONE KNOW WHAT HER SPECIFIC ROLE IS TO MAKE HIM SEEM MORE HUMAN 
UM NOT REALLY LESS HUMAN MORE ROBOTIC 
NO SHE'S BEEN GIVEN BRIEF OF 
THERE HE IS 
ALSO THIS WEEK THERE WAS THIS 
AND ALSO THIS 
ALTHOUGH THAT LOOKS LIKE A FORMULA ONE TEAM FIXING A CAR 
HE'S A ROBOT AND HE'S GONE OFF 
CAN WE SEE THE PICTURE BEFORE THIS IS HE BORED BY HIS OWN SPEECH 
SO WHO HAS GORDON BROWN PROMISED THE JOB TO WHEN HE LEAVES 
IS IT TO ED BALLS IT IS ABSOLUTELY WHO'S ED BALLS 
I'LL SHOW YOU WHO ED BALLS IS NOW 
CAN YOU HEAR THE WOOD CREAKING THERE GET OFF 
ONE KID CLAPPED YEAH 
BIG SWING TO LABOUR 
TO BE FAIR IT MIGHT'VE BEEN THE SOUND OF HIS BOLLOCKS SLAPPING AGAINST THE ROPE 
GORDON BROWN'S TEAM HAVE GIVEN HIM A MAKEOVER THIS WEEK 
INCREDIBLE WHAT A GOOD HAIRCUT AND A NEW SUIT WILL DO 
AND TONY BLAIR HAS REALLY MELLOWED SINCE LEAVING OFFICE 
YEAH THIS IS GORDON BROWN'S SMOOTH HANDLING OF THE COLLAPSE OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY 
THIS WEEK BROWN SUMMONED THE LEADING BANKS TO DOWNING STREET FOR A CRISIS MEETING 
TO SHOW HOW SERIOUSLY THEY TOOK HIS CONCERNS THE HALIFAX SENT THEIR TOP MAN 
HOUSE PRICES NOW APPEAR TO BE IN FREEFALL BUT THERE IS ONE SILVER LINING 
TONY BLAIR BOUGHT HIS CENTRAL LONDON MANSION AT THE HEIGHT OF THE BOOM 
IF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS CONTINUES UP TO FORTY THOUSAND CITY BAKERS COULD LOSE THEIR JOBS 
BAD NEWS FOR THE ECONOMY OF COLOMBIA 
MEANWHILE IN THE LONDON MAYORAL ELECTIONS 
BORIS JOHNSON WAS INTERVIEWED IN THE SUNDAY TIMES AND WAS ASKED WHAT HE'D DO ON HIS FIRST DAY AT CITY HALL 
BORIS JOHNSON TOUGH ON CHILDREN LESS TOUGH ON THE CAUSES OF CHILDREN 
IN THE INTERESTS OF BALANCE THE SAME COULD BE SAID OF KEN LIVINGSTON 
BUT NOT BRIAN PADDICK 
PAUL AND PETER HERE'S YOURS 
THIS IS STEVE REDGRAVE RUNNING WITH THE OLYMPIC TORCH 
THIS IS THE POLICE BATTERING PEOPLE BASICALLY 
IT'S TREVOR MCDONALD STANDING THERE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING 
THAT'S GORDON BROWN AGAIN MASKED BY THE CHINESE THUGS THAT HAVE COME OVER MASQUERADING AS ATHLETES 
THIS IS GREAT BATTERING 
SEE IT'S ALL IN THE NAME OF SPORTSMANSHIP 
ALL THIS BATTERING YOU KNOW THE MARATHON SHOULD BE RUN LIKE THAT 
TWENTY SIX MILES IS EASY YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT OFF PEOPLE LIKE IT'S A KNOCKOUT 
GIANT TEDDY BEARS COME AT YOU AND HIT YOU WITH STICKS 
A RABID DOG IS LET LOOSE FIFTEEN MILES IN 
LIVEN IT UP A BIT COS THEY'VE GOT THE WRONG IDEA 
IN THE MARATHON OVER HERE SOMEBODY DRESSES AS TRAFFIC LIGHTS AND FALLS OVER FROM EXHAUSTION 
NO THEY SHOULD BE THE PEOPLE RUNNING OUT DISTURBING THE ATHLETES 
THEY'RE GOOD IDEAS THOUGH PAUL ABSOLUTELY 
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN WHAT HAPPENED HERE IS SIR TREVOR MCDONALD 
THESE GUYS IN BLUE WERE CALLED FLAME ATTENDANTS 
TO COVER THE FACT THEY'RE MEMBERS OF THE CHINESE SECURITY SERVICES 
WHO ARE THERE TO HIT PEOPLE WHO TRY AND STOP THE FLAME 
WHEN THEY HIT THEM DOES IT GO 
I DON'T WANT TO BRING THE SUBJECT BACK TO BROWN BUT OH REALLY 
FUNNY THE WAY HE SAID HE COULDN'T ATTEND THE OPENING CEREMONY BECAUSE THAT'D BE APPALLING 
SO HE'S GOING TO ATTEND THE CLOSING CEREMONY WHICH IS DIFFERENT AND NOT APPALLING 
DIFFICULT TO DEFEND THAT 
NO HE'S GOT TO GO WE'RE HOSTING THE NEXT GAMES HE'S GOT TO TAKE THE TORCH BACK TO BRITAIN 
WHAT ALL THE WAY ALL THE WAY YEAH AS HAND LUGGAGE 
THE TORCH IS NOW IN INDIA THEY'RE SAYING THAT 
YOU'VE JUST COME BACK FROM INDIA I HAVE DID YOU NOT SEE IT NO 
THE TORCH WAS OVER HERE WHEN I WAS OVER THERE NOW IT'S OVER THERE 
BETWEEN ME AND THE OLYMPIC TORCH THERE SOME SORT OF CABLE CAR SYSTEM GOING ON 
I TRIED TO DO THIS JOKE WHEN I WAS IN CHINA IT'S PRESIDENT HU 
I'D SAY WHO'S THE PRESIDENT THEY'D SAY YES WELL WHO 
THEY NEVER GOT IT 
WHO INVENTED THE STEAM ENGINE WHAT THE STEAM ENGINE 
YOU KNOW IT'S THAT GAG 
WHO'S THE PRESIDENT YES I KNOW 
NO WONDER THEY'RE IN TROUBLE 
WHAT'S THE PRIME MINSTER CALLED HE'S CALLED WEN WHEN DID HE BECOME PRIME MINSTER 
THAT'S RIGHT HU THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO SEE THE PRIME MINISTER WEN 
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME 
WHAT HAPPENED TO BLUE PETER PRESENTER KONNIE HUQ 
I'M JUST GOING TO SAY KONNIE HUQ NOW IS OH 
SOMEONE AS I SPEAK SOMEONE HAS TRIED TO GRAB THE TORCH 
FROM KONNIE HUQ THE FORMER BLUE PETER PRESENTER 
SOMEONE A MAN HAS TRIED TO GRAB THE TORCH 
HE'S BEEN HAULED TO THE GROUND BY POLICE OFFICERS 
HE DID HAVE HIS HANDS ON THE TORCH 
UNBELIEVABLE 
HOW DARE HE 
DO YOU THINK HE GOT A BLUE PETER BADGE AT THE END 
LUCKILY KONNIE WAS ABLE TO CALL ON YEARS OF EXPERIENCE 
AND QUICKLY RUSTLE TOGETHER A NEW TORCH OUT OF 
COATHANGERS AND STICKY BACK PLASTIC 
AND A LABRADOR YEAH 
WHAT DID FU YING HAVE TO SAY ABOUT ALL THIS 
WHO WHO'S FU YING 
FU YING IS THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR 
SHE SAID THIS WAS APPALLING THIS BRITISH BEHAVIOUR 
AND EVERYONE WAS AMAZED 
SHE QUOTED SOMEONE SAYING IS THIS THE LAND OF DICKENS AND SHAKESPEARE 
NO THEY'RE DEAD 
BEEN DEAD FOR AGES 
HER POINT WAS THAT IT WAS BAD MANNERS 
TO PROTEST IN THIS WAY 
AND THAT DICKENS CERTAINLY WOULDN'T HAVE GONE ON ABOUT SWEATSHOPS 
AND FORCED LABOUR AND 
THIS IS BAD MANNERS SHE WENT OUT TO BEAT UP A MONK 
WHEN THE TORCH ARRIVED IN DOWNING STREET 
HOW DID GORDON BEHAVE AROUND IT 
HE WAS RELAXED AND JOVIAL 
HE REFUSED TO HOLD THE TORCH 
BUT UNLUCKY AS EVER THE TORCH STILL MANAGED TO SET FIRE TO HIS HAIR 
SO ANOTHER DAY OFF FOR NICOLA BURDETT OBVIOUSLY 
THEN OF COURSE 
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE TORCH REACHED ARGENTINA 
BARBECUE 
NO DIEGO MARADONA REFUSED TO HOLD THE TORCH 
COS HE DIDN'T WANT TO RISK BURNING HIS FOOTBALL PLAYING HANDS 
THIS IS THE CONTROVERSIAL JOURNEY OF THE OLYMPIC TORCH 
ON ITS WAY TO CHINA 
SOME LONDON CELEBRITIES BACKED OUT OF CARRYING THE TORCH 
AT ONE POINT PETE DOHERTY OFFERED TO TAKE IT 
BUT ONLY BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WAS A MASSIVE SPLIFF 
THE OLYMPIC TORCH WAS INTRODUCED FOR THE NINETEEN THIRTY SIX GAMES IN BERLIN 
AND WAS DESCRIBED BY HITLER AS A BEACON OF WORLD PEACE 
WHY IS IT PEOPLE ONLY REMEMBER THE BAD STUFF ABOUT THE NAZIS 
AND SO TO ROUND TWO THE PICTURE SPIN QUIZ 
FINGERS ON BUZZERS TEAMS 
THERE'S AN ENGINEER IN HACKNEY WHO IS KNOWN AS THE MOLE 
AND HE LOVES DIGGING TUNNELS 
UNDERNEATH HIS UNDER HIS OWN HOUSE THAT'S RIGHT 
AND HIS NEIGHBOURS' HOUSES AND THE STREET OUTSIDE YEAH 
AND WAS IT THEY ONLY FOUND OUT BECAUSE A NEIGHBOUR FOUND 
THE BAKERLOO LINE IN HER AIRING CUPBOARD 
THAT'S RIGHT THE BAKERLOO LINE IN HER AIRING CUPBOARD 
I DON'T MEAN TO BE THICK BUT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY HIM IS IT 
WELL IT WOULD EXPLAIN HIS TUNNEL DIGGING WOULDN'T IT 
I MEAN HOW CLOSELY HAS HE BEEN QUESTIONED DO THEY REALISE 
THEY'RE TALKING TO A MOLE IN A T. SHIRT 
THIS HAIRY BLOKE'S SAYING NOTHING SARGE 
NO LEAVE HIM IN THE DARK HE'LL SOON CRACK 
HIS NAME IS WILLIAM LITTLE 
AND UM USING A HOME MADE PULLEY 
HE EXCAVATED HUNDREDS OF FEET UNDER THE HOUSE 
AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE PROPERTY HAVE BEEN CUT AWAY 
OR AS A LOCAL ESTATE AGENT PUT IT 
MODERN OPEN PLAN LIVING WITH EXTENSIVE WINE CELLAR 
DO YOU WANT TO SEE A PICTURE OF HIS HOUSE IT STILL LOOKS O. K. YEAH 
HIS CAR'S A BIT OF A MESS 
ONE WOMAN WHO LIVES OPPOSITE MOLE MAN 
TOLD THE TIMES MOLE MAN 
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH BUSES ISN'T IT 
YOU WAIT ALL DAY FOR ONE TO COME ALONG 
AND THEN IT FALLS INTO A MAN MADE CREVASSE 
FINGERS ON BUZZERS 
THAT'S A PICTURE OF HARRY CONWAY FREDDIE 
IT'S HENRY HENRY 
HE'S ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WHO DID NOTHING AT UNIVERSITY 
WHICH IS UNSURPRISING MANY PEOPLE DO NOTHING AT UNIVERSITY 
EXCEPT THAT HE WAS PAID I THINK THIRTY THOUSAND FOR DOING IT 
YES HE'S HENRY IS HE I'M GOING TO GET ALL THESE NAMES 
HENRY CONWAY'S THE FATHER ISN'T HE NO DEREK CONWAY'S THE FATHER

THIS IS HENRY 
HENRY O. K. HE REFERS TO HIMSELF AS QUEEN SLOANE 
HE WAS PAID BY THE TAX PAYER TO DO NOTHING 
AS WAS HIS BROTHER THAT'S RIGHT 
AND A. THIS WAS AN AMAZING SCANDAL WASN'T IT BOB 
YES M. P.'S SHOVELLING MONEY TOWARDS THEIR OWN FAMILY 
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT HAVE YOU EVER EMPLOYED ANY OF YOUR FAMILY BOB NO 
I SIMPLY COULDN'T STAND THE INEFFICIENCY AND THE AGGRO 
IN OTHER MONEY RELATED NEWS INVESTIGATIONS INTO M. P.S' EXPENSES 
IN OTHER MONEY RELATED NEWS INVESTIGATIONS INTO M. P.S' EXPENSES 
HAVE REVEALED THAT IN TWO THOUSAND THREE JOHN PRESCOTT SPENT FOUR THOUSAND ON FOOD 
AND NO WE'RE NOT GOING TO SAY THAT HE SPENT IT ALL ON CHIPS 
BECAUSE WE HAPPEN TO KNOW AT LEAST ONE THOUSAND OF THAT WENT ON BROWN SAUCE 
AND WHAT DID IT TELL US ABOUT DAVID CAMERON 
NO IDEA I DON'T KNOW NOBODY'S GOT ANY BLOODY IDEA HAVE THEY

OF COURSE IN THE INTEREST OF BALANCE I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE OTHER HIGH STREET STORES

SERIOUSLY WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THE CATALOGUE 
I WAS GOING TO FLICK THROUGH IT AND SAY BOB HAVE YOU BOUGHT ANYTHING FROM THIS FUCKIN' CATALOGUE 
AND IT WOULD HAVE I THOUGHT IT WAS A FURNITURE CATALOGUE 
THIS IS THE SON OF TORY M. P. DEREK CONWAY WHO WAS PAID WHERE 
STUDYING AT UNIVERSITY HENRY SOMETIMES ACCOMPANIES CELEB CELEBRITIES TO

THE TROUBLE IS IT'S THE BEST BIT OF THE SHOW IT'S THE BEST BIT 
THEY'LL KEEP ALL THIS EVERYTHING ELSE'LL GO HENRY 
HENRY SOMETIMES ACCOMPANIES CELEBRITIES TO SHOWBIZ EVENTS 
OR AS THE DAILY MAIL PUT IT 
THAT'S ONE LETTER SHY OF THE TRUTH I THINK ISN'T IT 
SO ER FINGERS ON BUZZERS TEAMS 
A GENTLEMAN A VIOLINIST 
BY COINCIDENCE WHO ALSO PLAYS THE VIOLIN 
HE LEFT HIS VIOLIN ON A TRAIN 
AND WAS VERY UPSET BECAUSE IT WAS A VERY ANCIENT VIOLIN 
AS HE WAS GETTING OFF THE TRAIN HE WAS SORT OF WALKING DOWN THE PLATFORM 
HE SUDDENLY REALISED OH MY GOD I'VE LEFT MY VIOLIN ON THE ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE TO READING 
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT WAS IT TWELVE POINT FOUR FIVE TO READING YES IT WAS 
AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED WELL THAT'S THE ONE I FOUND IT ON OOH 
NO HE ACTUALLY TOOK IT UP TO LONDON TO HAVE IT VALUED 
THAT WAS THE SAD BIT 
THEN IT WAS VALUED AT AND HE FORGOT VALUED AT ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND 
ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND OH IT'S GONE UP M. M. M. 
SO THEY'VE 
THAT WAS SIMPLY BY THE WAY HE DESCRIBED IT PRESUMABLY 
IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS 
HE TOOK THE VIOLIN IT'S VIOLINY CAN I JUST EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED TO THE VIOLIN 
YEAH I DON'T KNOW NOT SO FAR 
HE TOOK GO ON GIVE IT ANOTHER GO 
HE TOOK THE VIOLIN FROM SOMERSET TO LONDON BY TRAIN 
HAD IT VALUED AT A VIOLIN VALUATION PLACE YEAH 
ONE OF THOSE VIOLIN VALUATION JOINTS 
THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE LIKE STARBUCKS THEY'RE EVERYWHERE 
THEY SAID IT'S WORTH ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
HE WENT BACK GOT ON THE TRAIN PUT IT UP ON THE LUGGAGE COMPARTMENT 
THEN GOT OFF THE TRAIN AND SAW THE TRAIN GOING OFF 
AND REALISED HE HADN'T TAKEN THE VIOLIN OFF THE TRAIN 
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HAS IT TURNED UP 
NO 
THE TRAIN HASN'T TURNED UP IS IT A GHOST TRAIN THAT HAS GONE BACK TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
DOESN'T THAT SAY A LOT FOR HIM AS A MAN 
YOU'RE TOLD THAT SOMETHING IN YOUR POSSESSION IS WORTH ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND AND YOU THINK WOW GREAT OH 
I'LL JUST PUT IT UP THERE YEAH I THINK SO 
HE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT VERY MATERIALISTIC NO OR CLEVER 
SIXTY SEVEN YEAR OLD MR. NAPIER SAID 
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN 
PERHAPS TREVOR HOWARD HAS GOT IT 
WHO ELSE LOST SOME LUGGAGE RECENTLY 
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO TRIED TO FLY FROM HEATHROW TERMINAL FIVE THEY DID

BECAUSE WHAT SHE HAD IN HER SUITCASE 
WAS GRADE A WAS GRADE A 
HOW UPSET WAS KATE 
ACCORDING TO THE STAR DO YOU WANNA KNOW 
ACCORDING TO THE STAR'S ACE COLUMN THE GOSS 
THE EYE CAKE THE EYE CAKE'S SHOCK GLAND WAS THROBBING

THE EYE CAKE 
TIME NOW FOR THE ODD ONE OUT ROUND 
ONE BETWEEN YOU THIS WEEK YOUR FOUR ARE 
THAT WOMAN OFF HOW CLEAN IS YOUR HOUSE 
JEREMY PAXMAN SIX MASAI WARRIORS AND THIS WOMAN FROM HARTLEPOOL 
IAN AND BOB 
THERE'S PAXMAN THIS IS AN UNDERPANT QUESTION 
THE MASAI WARRIORS DON'T WEAR THEM IS THAT RIGHT 
WHEN THEY BECOME WARRIORS THEN THEY TAKE OFF THEIR PANTS 
I BECOME A WARRIOR EVERY NIGHT 
MOST NIGHTS 
THEN IN THE MORNING YOU'RE NOT A WARRIOR AGAIN NO WELL FIRST HALF HOUR 
SO ERM 
YOU HAVE TO KILL A LION AS WELL OH TELL ME ABOUT IT YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR PANTS OFF 
AND KILL A LION AND THEN YOU'RE A MAN 
YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT TO PUT YOUR PANTS ON A LION THAT'S 
THAT'S THE REAL TEST OF MANHOOD THAT WAS THE OLD TEST 
THEY'VE CHANGED IT THEY DON'T TELL YOU ANYTHING IT'S REGULATIONS OH 
HEALTH AND SAFETY YEAH NO ONE'S COME UP WITH THE ODD ONE OUT YET 
JEREMY PAXMAN'S THE ODD ONE OUT HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO'S HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH UNDERPANTS 
THE REST HAVE HAD A COMPLETELY FREE AND EASY RELATIONSHIP WITH UNDERPANTS 
YES THAT IS CORRECT ACTUALLY YES 
IT WAS LIKE ALTERNATIVE REALITY THERE FOR A MINUTE 
IT WAS INCORRECT BUT I DECIDED TO MAKE IT CORRECT 
BECAUSE I WANT TO MOVE ON 
YEAH O. K. THEY ALL COMPLAINED ABOUT PANTS 
IS THAT THE LINK EXCEPT HER 
THEY'VE ALL BEEN GRATEFUL FOR THEIR PANTS EXCEPT FOR PAXMAN PAXMAN 
SO PAUL WAS RIGHT 
YES AND NO I'VE SAID BOTH OPTIONS 
SO WE CAN EDIT AROUND IT WHICHEVER WAY 
BUT OUR ANSWER WAS THE BETTER ANSWER 
FINE WE CAN GET ON WITH IT NOW CAN'T WE 
NOW EVERYONE'S GOT THEIR PROPERTY BACK 
SO YEAH PAXMAN SAID IN HIS EMAIL 
AND AGGIE MCKENZIE ANYONE KNOW ABOUT HER STORY THIS 
SHE'S JUST SLIPPED HER HANDS IN BOILING HOT WATER 
SHE'S BEEN ON A PROGRAMME CALLED DANCING ON ICE AND WHAT WAS WRONG WHAT'S IT ABOUT 
IT'S 
THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER NORMAL PANTS 
THEY WERE TOO BIG AND THEY DANGLED BELOW HER HI FI COSTUME 
IN AN EARLIER SHOW SHE HAD WORN NO PANTS AT ALL 
OH 
WHAT ABOUT MRS. WOMAN AT THE BOTTOM THERE STRETCHING THOSE PANTS 
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS THIS WOMAN WAS AT HOME 
FRYING SOME BREAD YOU KNOW 
AND THE PAN CAUGHT FIRE 
AND SHE PUT OUT THE FIRE WITH THE KNICKERS 
ACTUALLY I THINK IT WAS HER CHILDREN PUT OUT THE FIRE 
WHILE SHE WAS HAVING A PUB LUNCH 
HOW CAN SHE HAVE BEEN HAVING A PUB LUNCH AND FRYING BREAD AT HOME 
DOES SHE WORK IN A PUB NO 
SHE'S GOT A FRYING PAN THAT YOU CAN CONTROL BY EMAIL I THINK 
IS THERE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FACT THAT PANTS AND PAN ARE VERY SIMILAR WORDS 
I CAN SEE THIS IS GOING TO GO JUST LIKE THE VIOLIN ROUND 
HAS SHE HAD HER PANTS VALUED AT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND 
THEY'RE MADE BY STRADIVARIUS ONE OF THE ONLY PAIR OF UNDERPANTS HE EVER MADE 
HE GOT FED UP WITH VIOLINS ONE DAY BLAH BLAH MAKE A PAIR OF PANTS 
STRADIVARIUS PANTS 
MADE OUT OF CAT GUT 
SORT OF G. STRING 
VERY GOOD 
AND THE MASAI WARRIORS HAD TO WEAR M. AND AMP S. PANTS WHEN THEY RAN THE MARATHON 
SO THAT THEIR BLANKETS WOULDN'T FLAP UP AND OFFEND PEOPLE 
ARE THEY VERY OFFENSIVE BLANKETS APPARENTLY 
MAYBE IT'S A EUPHEMISM FOR SOMETHING 
I'VE NEVER BEEN OFFENDED BY A BLANKET HAVE YOU 
THE MASAI WARRIORS WERE STAYING IN A GUESTHOUSE IN KENT 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR SPECIAL DIETARY REQUIREMENTS WERE 
ACCORDING TO MRS. MARTIN WHO RUNS THE GUESTHOUSE 
MILK BLOOD AND MILK YEAH YOU ARE RIGHT 
THEY DIDN'T ASK MRS. MARTIN FOR BLOOD WHEN THEY WERE THERE 
THEY ACTUALLY ASKED HER FOR COCO POPS AND TEA WITH LOTS OF SUGAR 
AND BLOOD ON IT A ZEBRA OMELETTE 
THEY LIKE TO DRINK THEIR OWN BLOOD WELL NOT THEIR OWN BLOOD 
BUT THEY DRINK BLOOD THAT THEY BRING WITH THEM HUMAN BLOOD 
NO NOT HUMAN BLOOD NO 
I SAID THEY LIKE TO DRINK THEIR OWN BLOOD AND NOW YOU'RE TAKING ME TO TASK ON IT 
THERE'S ONLY EIGHT PINTS OF IT TRY TO LET IT GO O. K. 
THEY LIKE TO EAT THEIR OWN FLESH SORRY I MEAN THEY LIKE TO EAT BACON 
SORRY I MADE A MISTAKE 
PUNCH THEMSELVES IN THE HEAD NO I MEANT BINGO 
IT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE 
THEY DRINK FIVE LITRES AT A TIME OF BLOOD AND AS 
AS ONE OF THEM SAID IT GIVES ME LOTS OF ENERGY 
BUT IT MAKES THE COCO POPS GO A FUNNY COLOUR 
I'VE BEEN INSIDE A MASAI HUT 
HAVE YOU YEAH I GOT OFFERED BLOOD 
GOOD WAS IT 
I DIDN'T DRINK THE BLOOD 
I CAME OVER A BIT ENGLISH 
I SAID OH THAT LOOKS LOVELY THAT BLOOD 
BUT I'VE JUST EATEN SO 
I WON'T HAVE THE BLOOD THANK YOU 
AND THEY WERE GIVEN SOME ADVICE ABOUT BEING IN THIS COUNTRY 
UNLESS OF COURSE YOU'RE IN LIVERPOOL WHERE IT'S PRETTY MUCH STANDARD PRACTICE 
O. I. O. I. I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T LIKE THAT PETER 
SORRY YOU'RE FROM LIVERPOOL AREN'T YOU YES 
WELL STAY OFF MY STUFF YOU THIEVING BASTARD 
THEY'VE ALL BEEN GRATEFUL FOR THEIR M. AND AMP S. PANTS APART FROM JEREMY PAXMAN 
WHO CLAIMS HIS PAIR NO LONGER PROVIDE ADEQUATE SUPPORT 
AND CAUSE HIM GUSSET ANXIETY 
THIS STORY GAVE THE TIMES AN EXCUSE TO THROW TOGETHER 
WHICH INCLUDED THIS LITTLE KNOWN FACT 
THAT WAS DURING THE BLITZ SO YOU CAN PROBABLY IMAGINE COLOUR 
THE MASAI WARRIORS RAN THE LONDON MARATHON IN TRADITIONAL ROBES 
CARRYING THEIR SHIELDS AND BRANDISHING THEIR SPEARS 
WHICH MADE FOR A NERVY FEW HOURS FOR THAT BLOKE IN THE RHINO OUTFIT 
THE WARRIORS WERE GIVEN A FOUR PAGE SET OF GUIDELINES 
ON LIFE IN BRITAIN INCLUDING THIS INFORMATION ABOUT BRITISH BEHAVIOUR 
AND IF YOU'RE A VISITOR TO THIS COUNTRY DON'T WORRY

COULDN'T GO STRAIGHT EVEN IF HE WANTED TO 
COULDN'T STOP A PIG IN A PASSAGE 
THE ANSWER IS 
THIS IS THE BURGLAR IDENTIFIED BY THE UNUSUAL WAY HE WALKED 
THE BOW LEGGED BURGLAR DIDN'T HAVE A GETAWAY CAR WAITING FOR HIM 
ALTHOUGH POLICE DID LATER FIND AN ABANDONED SPACE HOPPER 
THE BURGLAR WITH A DISTINCTIVE GAIT HAS NOW BEEN SENT TO PRISON FOR TWO YEARS 
AND IF HE THINKS HE WALKS FUNNY NOW HO 
SO THE FINAL SCORES ARE 
IAN AND BOB HAVE EIGHT 
AND PAUL AND PETER HAVE SIX 
ON WHICH NOTE WE SAY THANK YOU TO OUR PANELLISTS 
IAN HISLOP AND BOB MARSHALL ANDREWS PAUL MERTON AND PETER SERAFINOWICZ 
I LEAVE YOU WITH NEWS THAT AS THE ELECTION FOR LONDON MAYOR CONTINUES 
BORIS JOHNSON'S TRANSPORT ADVISOR DENIES HE'S OUT OF TOUCH WITH MODERN LIFE 
THERE'S CONSTERNATION AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE AS THE QUEEN FALLS INTO A TUMBLE DRYER 
AND ONE HOUSEWIFE DISCOVERS THERE IS SOMETHING WORSE THAN OPENING YOUR DOOR TO JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES 
GOODNIGHT
