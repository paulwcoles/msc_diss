WHEN SYED LEFT YOUR FATHER COULDN'T COPE 
HE WAS JUST A BOOK KEEPER SYED WAS THE ACCOUNTANT 
HE TRIED TO KEEP THINGS GOING BUT LOSING HIS SON 
THE BUSINESS JUST DIDN'T MATTER ANY MORE 
AND THE TRUTH IS WE WERE JUST IN A MESS 
UNCLE IMZAMAM

HELPED US SELL UP MOVE HERE 
WITHOUT HIM I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WOULD HAVE DONE 
THAT'S WHAT FAMILIES DO 
IT SHOULDN'T GIVE HIM SOME KIND OF HOLD OVER YOU YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG 
I THOUGHT YOU AND MINTY WERE GETTING ON WELL WE ARE BUT WE'RE MORE LIKE BEST FRIENDS 
HEV HAVE YOU MADE A MOVE 
OH WHAT DO YOU WANT CUE CARDS 
YOU CAN'T CREATE A SPARK YOU EITHER GOT IT OR YOU AIN'T 
MAYBE IT'S TIME I FACED UP TO IT 
ME AND MINTY AIN'T NO RELATIONSHIP IS PERFECT HEV YOU KNOW THAT 
BUT YOURS IS 
I WAS SIXTEEN LIVING IN PAKISTAN 
AND I HAD A FRIEND WHO WAS MARRIED TO A LOCAL BOY 
WHAT WAS SHE CALLED AMINA 
SHE WAS HAPPY AT FIRST 
HER FAMILY WERE VERY KIND TO HER 
SHE SPENT MOST OF HER TIME IN THE KITCHEN COOKING 
AND THEN ONE DAY A YOUNG MAN CAME TO THE VILLAGE VISITING RELATIVES 
AND THEY FELL IN LOVE 
BET THAT DIDN'T GO DOWN WELL 
THERE WAS SO MUCH WORK TO BE DONE IN THE HOUSE THAT SHE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO SEE HIM 
BUT SHE FOUND A WAY 
THERE WERE EXCUSES SECRET MEETINGS 
IT WAS ALL VERY EXCITING 
THEY WERE ALWAYS CAREFUL 
BUT SOMEONE MUST HAVE SEEN THEM 
THEY GOT FOUND OUT 
A RUMOUR STARTED THAT WAS ENOUGH 
AND THEN THE FAMILY STOPPED HER GOING OUT SHE WAS LIKE A PRISONER 
YOU SEE EVERYONE SAID 
THAT SHE HAD SHAMED THE FAMILY 
AND THEN ONE DAY IN THE KITCHEN THERE WAS A DIFFERENT SMELL 
NOT SPICES SOMETHING STRONGER 
KEROSENE 
AND HEAT ON MY SKIN 
BITING 
I RAN TO THE KITCHEN DOOR BUT IT WAS LOCKED 
AND THEN I STARTED SCREAMING SHOUTING FOR SOMEONE ANYONE 
COME QUICKLY THE KITCHEN'S ON FIRE 
AND I STARTED PUSHING AND PUSHING BUT I COULDN'T OPEN THE DOOR 
SO I RAN TO THE WINDOW AND THAT'S WHEN I SAW HER HER FACE 
STARING BACK AT ME THROUGH THE FLAMES 
DID SHE GET OUT 
SHE WAS BURNED THEY TOOK HER TO THE HOSPITAL 
BUT AFTERWARDS 
NO ONE SPOKE ABOUT IT 
WHY IT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT 
IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT 
IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT 
SPARE BATTERIES FOR YOUR TORCH SPARE FUSES BATTERY OPERATED RADIO THAT'S IT 
THAT IS TANYA'S EMERGENCY SUPPLY KIT BUT I KEEP A BOTTLE OF VODKA IN MINE 
OH I SAY I AM IMPRESSED 
MIND YOU I NEVER TOUCH ALCOHOL

WELL SINCE WE WAS MARRIED I'VE ALWAYS LEFT ALL THAT TO JIM 
DON'T GET ME WRONG I'M NO WOMEN'S LIBBER

MUM YOU DON'T BELIEVE 
YOU CAN'T I'M NOT SAYING THAT I AGREE WITH IT 
YOU CAN'T GO AGAINST EVERYTHING EVERYONE STAND ALONE 
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO WHY CAN'T YOU ACCEPT FOR ONCE THAT YOUR MOTHER KNOWS BEST
