THE BIRTHPLACE OF REMARKABLE 
SPORTING LEGEND IT WAS HERE THAT 
JOE CALZAGHE FIRST LACED UP A PAIR 
OF BOXING GLOVES AND DARED TO DREAM 
FIFTEEN YEARS INTO HIS PROFESSIONAL 
CAREER AND JOE CALZAGHE HAS 
REALISED THAT DREAM OVER A DECADE 
OF DOMINANCE AS THE SUPER 
MIDDLEWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD 
HE HAS PUSHED HIS WAY TO A PERFECT 
RECORD UNDEFEATED IN THIRTY FOUR FIGHTS 
PUNCHED HIS WAY AND YET 
INCREDIBLY QUESTION MARKS REMAIN 
CRITICS CARP THAT HE HAS NEVER BEEN 
OUT OF HIS COMFORT ZONE HE HAS 
NEVER PROVED IT WHERE IT REALLY 
COUNTS NOT CARDIFF BUT LAST VEGAS 
NEVADA WHERE BOXING LEGENDS BUILD 
THEIR LEGACY ROUND BY ROUND 
IT IS 
GREAT TO BE HERE IT IS A LONG TIME 
COMING TO THE STATES SO REALLY 
HAPPY TO BE HERE 
AND SO IT WAS 
THAT THE LOW KEY BUT BRILLIANT 
BRITISH BOXING SUPERSTAR ROSE TO 
THAT IRRESISTIBLE CHALLENGE HE 
WOULD HEADLINE IN LAS VEGAS HE 
WOULD FIGHT ABOVE HIS NATURAL 
WEIGHT CLASS AT HIS OPPONENT WOULD 
BE ONE OF THE GREATEST BOXERS OF 
HIS GENERATION THE SELF PROCLAIMED 
LIVING LEGEND ONCE AGAIN BRITISH 
BOXING FANS FLOCKED IN THEIR 
THOUSANDS TO LAS VEGAS NEVADA THE 
FIGHT CAPITAL OF THE WORLD FOR THE 
SECOND TIME IN FIVE MONTHS PLAYING 
HOST TO A SUPER FIGHT INVOLVING ONE 
OF BRITAIN'S FINEST THIS TIME 
PERHAPS THE FINEST SO COULD JOE 
CALZAGHE SUCCEED WHERE RICKY HATTON 
CAME UP SHORT AND KATE AND LEAVE 
THE BIT AND LEAVE THE DESERT 
VICTORIOUS A COUPLE OF MILES OF 
NORTH OF THE FAMOUS STRIP THAT THE 
THOMAS AND MACK CENTER IT WAS THE 
WELSH MAN WHO MADE HIS WAY TO THE 
RING FIRST LOOKING INCREDIBLY 
RELAXED ON HIS AMERICAN DEBUT THE 
VOCAL TRAVELLING SUPPORT MAKING LAS 
VEGAS SEEMED LIKE HOME CALZAGHE 
WAS FOLLOWED BY BERNARD DE 
EXECUTIONER HOPKINS THE 
PHILADELPHIA HAS MADE THIS WALK 
MANY TIMES AND LAS VEGAS AND HIS 
EXPRESSION BEFITTED HIS RING THE 
MONIKER AT STAKE STATUS AS THE 
WORLD'S NO ONE LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT 
AND YOUR COMMENTATORS OTHER FORMER 
CHAMPION SPENCER OLIVER AND JIM 
NEILLY 
THE SCENE IS SET FOR ONE OF THE 
BEST CONTESTS THE WORLD HAS EVER 
SEEN JOE CORTES THE MAN IN THE 
MIDDLE FOR THE MOST RECENT FLOYD 
MAYWEATHER JUNIOR RICKY HATTON 
FIGHT BUT HE IS MOVING UP TO TAKE 
CHARGE OF A HUGELY IMPORTANT 
CONTEST BETWEEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL 
SUPER MIDDLEWEIGHT BOXER OF ALL 
TIME AND THE MOST SUCCESSFUL 
MIDDLEWEIGHT BOXER OF ALL TIME AND 
HOPKINS NEEDLESS TO SAY ENJOYING 
A BIT OF A HEIGHT ADVANTAGE BUT TO 
TAKE THAT AWAY SPENCER OLIVER 
HERE'S THE POLL 
HE CAN BE THE ONE 
HE CAN EXPECT TO FIGHT HERE HE 
WILL SET THE PACE HOPKINS WILL BE 
LOOKING TO COUNT FROM THE OUTSIDE 
COUNTER FROM THE OUTSIDE HE HE BREAKS THEM UP ONE OF THE MAIN 
CRITICISMS LEVELLED AGAINST THEM 
AND THEY HAD THE MAYWEATHER FIGHT 
WAS THAT HE BROKE IT UP FAR TOO 
MUCH AND DID NOT LET TATTON WHO 
WANTED TO GET INSIDE GO ABOUT HIS 
WORK L. THINK THESE TWO ARE HUGELY 
PROFESSIONAL NEEDLESS TO SAY AS 
WERE MAYWEATHER AND HATTON THEY 
WANT TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS A 
GOOD RIGHT HAND WHAT A CRACKING 
SHOT FROM HOPKINS CALZAGHE THAT 
PERHAPS THE THIRD TIME IN HIS 
CAREER FINDS HIMSELF ON THE CANVAS 
HE TAKES THAT PUNCH SPENCER WHAT 
A SHOT 
TREMENDOUS PERFECT DOWN 
THE MIDDLE CALZAGHE WAS STUNNED 
THERE 
IT WAS STRAIGHT IT WAS THERE SWEET IT WAS PERFECT IT WAS ON 
THE MONEY AS THEY SAY IN THIS PART 
OF THE WORLD AND HAS CUT THAT HE 
RECOVERED NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS 
THAT IS GOING TO BE AN OPENING TEN 
EIGHT ROUND TO THE MAN THEY CALL 
THE EXECUTIONER FROM PHILADELPHIA 
HE WENT TO PRISON AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN 
YEARS OF AGE THAT WAS A CRACKING 
SHOT FROM BERNARD HOPKINS AND 
CALZAGHE REALLY HAS GOT TO COME 
BACK OUT THERE IS ANOTHER GOOD 
RIGHT HAND FROM HOPKINS CALZAGHE CALZAGHE HAS GOT TO BE CAREFUL OF THAT SHOT 
CALZAGHE SEEMS TO BE FOCUSED GOT 
HIS HEAD BACK TOGETHER STILL 
FORWARD BUT HOPKINS DID NOT JUMP ON 
SHOW THERE YOU WOULD EXPECT HIM 
BUT HAS NOT CAPITALISED ON THAT 
GOOD FOOTWORK BY HOPKINS JUST 
MOVING AWAY FROM CALZAGHE'S LEFT 
HAND TO KEEP THE LEFT FOOT 
OUT INSTEPS THE REFEREE HE HAS 
GOOD LOOK AT HOPKINS BUT HOPKINS 
WILL BE FEELING VERY CONFIDENT 
ABOUT THAT YOU COULD NOT HAVE HAD 
A BETTER START 
A PERFECT START FOR 
HOPKINS TOLL CAME FROM A SHORT 
RIGHT HAND JOE HAS TO BE CAREFUL 
CREATING THE OPENINGS OR HOPKINS 
AS A TREMENDOUS COUNTERPUNCH THAT 
IS THE WAY HE LIKES TO FIGHT ONE 
TWO JOE CANNOT AFFORD TO GIVE HIM 
THAT SPACE 
HOPKINS HAD AT FORTY THREE 
YEARS OF AGE AS A TIP TOP CONDITION 
CALZAGHE IS LOOKING GOOD THEY ARE 
BOTH ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE L. B. S. A COUPLE OF L. B. S. 
UNDERNEATH THIS IS A CONTEST THAT 
CALZAGHE DOES NOT WANT TO LOSE HE 
DOES NOT WANT TO FORGO THAT 
WONDERFUL WONDERFUL UNBEATEN 
RECORD AND ONLY THE GREAT JOE LOUIS 
AND ONE OTHER FIGHTER HAVE MADE 
MORE DEFENCES THAT THIS HE DID A 
SHOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT ROUND 
AND DAD IS NOT TOO HAPPY HE TOOK 
A SHOT 
THEY ARE GIVING STERN WORDS 
TO JOE SAYING YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO 
TAKE SHOTS LIKE THAT AGAINST 
SOMEONE LIKE HOPKINS HE LOOKS NICE 
AND RELAXED IN THE CORNER FREDDIE 
ROACH IS GIVING INSTRUCTIONS 
HERE IT IS AGAIN LOOK AT THIS HIS 
LEFT HAND DISAPPEAR AND HOPKINS 
CAME THROUGH WITH THE CLASSICS 
STRAIGHT RIGHT AND THE SHOULDER 
FOLLOWED THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF 
PUSH ON AT THE END THERE IS NO 
DOUBTING THE VALIDITY OF THAT 
PUNCH 
TREMENDOUS STRAIGHT DOWN PUNCH THE MIDDLE IT CAUGHT JOE COLE JOE 
TO HIS CREDIT CAME BACK WELL AND 
GOT HIS BOGUS BACK TOGETHER BUT HE 
HAS TO BE CAREFUL THERE IS THE 
WARNING SIGNS FROM HOPKINS 
CALZAGHE COMES IN OFF THE BACK OF A 
MAGNIFICENT PERFORMANCE AGAINST THE 
PREVIOUSLY UNBEATEN JANE DANISH 
BOXER LAST NOVEMBER TO TAKE THE W. B. A. 
AND W. B. C. TITLES HE HAS BEEN THE W. B. O. 
SUPER MIDDLEWEIGHT CHAMPION SINCE 
TIME IMMEMORIAL BUT THIS IS A 
DIFFERENT PROSPECT AND HE HAS GOT 
TO RECOVER FROM THAT AND THAT IS 
GOING TO BE A TEN EIGHT ROUND AND 
HE NEEDS TO WIN DO IN ROW TO GET 
BACK ON LEVEL TERMS 
HE DOES HE 
NEEDS TO GET THE CONFIDENCE BACK UP 
THERE A DREADFUL START FROM 
CALZAGHE HE WILL BE LOOKING TO 
PRESSURE HERE AND TAKE THE BLAME 
AWAY FROM HOPKINS HOPKINS IS A 
GREAT FIGHTER CANCELLING THE OTHER 
OUT THE MAN OUT THE COUNTERPUNCH 
IS SO WELL MAKES PEOPLE LOOK SO 
BAD AS HE DOES HERE AGAINST JOE 
HE LIKES TO GRAB HOLD COME COME TOGETHER SAYS JOE CORTES AND 
HOPKINS JUST STANDING BACK A 
LITTLE BIT WHICH WILL SHOOT WHICH 
WILL SUIT HIM CALZAGHE HAS BECOME 
BORED OR ACTION BOXER BELOW LEFT 
IN THERE CALZAGHE HOLDING ON THE 
BLIND SIDE AND CLUBBING AWAY WITH 
THE LEFT HAND OF HIS CONCEDING 
ABOUT AN INCH AND A HALF ON HEIGHT 
SOMETHING SIMILAR IN TERMS OF REACH 
HOPKINS HAS BEEN TALKING A VERY 
GOOD FIGHT AND A VERY AGGRESSIVE 
FIGHTER AND SOME OF THOSE COMMENTS 
HAVE NOT ALTOGETHER BEEN 
APPRECIATED BY THE CALZAGHE CAMP OR 
BY PUNDITS AND PUNTERS ON THIS SIDE 
OF THE POND THE U. K. SIDE OF THE 
POND ONE HAS TO SAY GOOD WORKING 
SIDE BY HOPKINS LITTLE CLUB AROUND 
THE JAW GOOD WORK INSIDE BY 
HOPKINS 
CALZAGHE ARE LOOKING MORE HOPKINS COMFORTABLE IN THE SECOND ROUND 
THE GOOD LEFT HAND OF HIS OWN THERE 
JUST MISSING HOPKINS THAT RIGHT 
THE RIGHT OF HOPKINS IS VERY VERY 
QUICK CORTES IS TELLING HOPKINS 
DID BEHAVE HIMSELF A LITTLE BIT 
CALZAGHE IS LOOKING A BIT MORE 
FOCUSED NOW DON'T THINK HE WAS 
HURT BY THAT SHOT JUST EMBARRASSED 
AND SURPRISED AND UPSET MORE MORE STUNNED BY UNHURT HE HAS BEEN ON 
THE FLOOR AGAINST BYRON MITCHELL 
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THREE HE WAS ON THE FLOOR 
FOR THE FIRST TIME L. THINK HOPKINS 
COMPLAINING OF A LOW BLOW THERE L. 
DID NOT SEE ANYTHING THERE HE HE STOPPED AND HE IS HURT AND HE IS 
NOT TUBBY THERE WAS A TYRRELL TWO 
IN THE EYE BUT THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS 
WHEN YOU TAKE SOMETHING SOUTH OF 
THE BORDER THERE WAS A TEAR OR 
TWO IN HIS EYE WHAT CONDITION HE 
IS IN FOR A FORTY THREE YEAR OLD HE HE CERTAINLY IS IN TREMENDOUS 
CONDITION 
IT IS GETTING A BIT CONDITION MESSY HOPKINS HAD BEEN TO SLOW 
DOWN THE PACE A LITTLE BIT HE 
DOESN'T WANT TO FIGHT AT CALZAGHE'S 
PACE HE MAY HAVE SHADED THIS ROUND 
THAT THE TEN SECONDS SOUND SAMS 
HOPKINS USING EVERY TRICK IN THE 
BOOK HOLDING THE WELCHMAN'S RANK 
UNDERNEATH HIS LEFT ARM A SLIGHTLY 
BETTER ROUND BY CALZAGHE BUT THERE 
WAS NOT MUCH IN IT 
CALZAGHE JUST 
SHADED IT JUST PRESSING FORWARD 
AND MAYBE JUST A HIGHER WORK RATE 
FROM CALZAGHE THERE SEEMS TO BE A 
CUT THEIR ON THE BRIDGE OF THE NOSE 
ARE YOU LISTENING JOE BE 
PUGNACIOUS COMING IN JUMPING TO 
THE ZONE SORRY 
DAD ENZO ISN'T SORRY IT AMAZING THE FATHER SON 
RELATIONSHIP A THIRTY SIX YEARS OF AGE HE

YEARS OF AGE 
TEN A EIGHT THE OPENING ROUND TO THE 
EXECUTIONER THE THIRTY THREE THE FORTY THREE YEAR

JOE HAS TO 
KEEP PUSHING FORWARD HERE TRYING 
TO FORCE THE PACE HOPKINS LIKES TO 
BOX IN HIS OWN COMFORT ZONE JOE 
HAS TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM HIM KEEP 
PUSHING FORWARD KEEP LEADING OFF 
WITH THEIR LEFT HANDS 
INSIDE IS ABSOLUTELY JAM PACKED 
TOM JONES GIVING ONE OF THE MOST 
RENDITION THE MOST WONDERFUL 
RENDITIONS OF THE WELSH ANTHEM AND 
THE AMERICAN ANTHEM WAS TREATED 
RESPECTFULLY BY THE EIGHT THOUSAND OR SO THE 
VISITING FANS THEY HAVE COME A 
LONG WAY TO SUPPORT THEM BUT FAST 
HANDS ONCE AGAIN BY HOPKINS 
CALZAGHE CAN'T AFFORD TO DROP THOSE 
HANDS 
HE CAN'T AFFORD TO HOPKINS HANDS IS A MASTER OF A SINGLE SHOT SPUN A 
LANDING PERFECTLY CALZAGHE CAN'T 
AFFORD TO GET CARELESS AS HE DID 
THERE AGAIN THE BETTER INSIDE WORK 
AT THE MOMENT COMING FROM HOPKINS 
HE HAS BEEN KNOWN DOWN THE YEARS AS 
A HARD HARD MAN AND HE HAS BLOWN 
UP JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY AWAY HE 
HAS MADE TWENTY DEFENCES OF HIS 
MIDDLEWEIGHT TITLE MORE THAN THE 
GREAT ARGENTINIAN 
THE MAN WHO STOPPED THE MAN HE IS 
NOW CO PROMOTER IT WITH OSCAR DE LA 
HOYA STOPPED THEM IN NINE ROUNDS 
THREE YEARS AGO A CRACKING BERDYCH 
CRACKING BODY SHOT 
CALZAGHE OCCUPYING THE CENTRE OF 
THE RING YOU GET THE SENSE THAT 
HOPKINS IS TRYING TO DRAW HIM ON TO 
THE RIGHT HANDED IN 
THAT IS WHAT I 
HAVE BEEN SAYING HOPKINS TRIED TO 
DRAW A JOKE IN JOE NEEDS TO START 
MAKING THE FATE HIMSELF HE IS 
COUNTERING WELL ON THE OUTSIDE HE 
DOES NOT WASTE A LOT HOPKINS DOES 
NOT LIKE TO FIGHT AT A VAST PAYS 
EXTRAORDINARY TO THINK THAT HOPKINS 
LOST HIS VERY FIRST CONTEST AND DID 
NOT BOX AGAIN FOR ABOUT SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN 
MONTHS AND NEARLY THOUGHT ABOUT 
PACKING IT IN BET HE IS GLAD HE DIDN'T 
HE CERTAINLY HAS A DIDN'T TREMENDOUS AMBASSADOR FOR THE SPORT 
CALZAGHE COMING FORWARD AGAIN GOOD

FIGHTERS AROUND SOME OF THE 
BIGGEST PUNCHES WE SEE HIM LAST 
TIME AROUND AND HE LOOKED 
TREMENDOUS HE'D LOOKED HE TOOK 
SOME BIG SHOTS AND HE DID NOT 
FLINCH L. DO NOT THINK HE IS 
WORRIED ABOUT HOPKINS'S POWER I'VE I'VE BEEN JOE CALZAGHE IS BEHIND TO DO 
TO THAT OPENING I THINK HE FOUND 
HIMSELF ON THE CANVAS YOU HAVE TO 
ASK IF HOPKINS THAT FORTY THREE CAN KEEP 
GOING AT THIS PACE 
THIS IS THE 
PLAN FOR JOE CALZAGHE TO FIGHT AT 
A GOOD PIECE PACE 
MOVE THE 
MOVE THE OTHER WAY YOU HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT 
TO DO ANY COMBINATIONS 
A BIT OF 
ACTION FROM THE GROUND JOE 
CALZAGHE'S DEFENCE WAS ALL OVER THE 
PLACE 
YES THAT IS WHERE HE HAS TO PLACE BE CAREFUL WITH THAT RIGHT HAND 
FOUR GONE EIGHT LEFT TO GO THE 
OPENING FIRST ROUND JOE CALZAGHE 
WAS DONE JOE CALZAGHE IS COMING 
FORWARD THEIR OWN 
JOE CALZAGHE 
HAS TURNED TO TAKE OPTIONS OUT OF 
HIS COMFORT ZONE IS TRYING TO 
TAKE HOPKINS JOE CALZAGHE 
EXPECTING TO BE PUSHING FORWARD CO 
AT THE MOMENT HOPKINS IS DOING A 
TREMENDOUS JOB OF CANCELLING THEM 
OUT 
JOE CALZAGHE RESPONDING WITH OUT QUICK HANDS THAT IS BETTER STILL 
HOPKINS AT ONE STAGE HELD ALL FOUR 
VERSIONS OF THE WORLD MIDDLEWEIGHT 
CROWN MODERN GREATS WHAT A 
COUP THIS WOULD BE FOR JOE CALZAGHE 
IF HE CAN BEAT HOPKINS IT IT CERTAINLY WOULD HIS FIRST TIME 
BOXING IN AMERICA IT HAS BEEN A 
LONG TIME COMING TO BEAT SOMEBODY 
LIKE BERNARD HOPKINS WOULD BE A 
TREMENDOUS FEAT HE IS DOING A 
TREMENDOUS JOB FORCING THIS PACE L. 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM LANDING A FEW 
CLEANER SHOTS NOTHING REALLY CLEAN 
LANDING AT THE MOMENT 
ABBOT OF 
SLAPPING IN THERE I AM NOT SURE IT 
IS ALTOGETHER CLEANER BUT THAT IS 
DOWN TO THE JUDGE AT THE RINGSIDE 
CLEAN LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION 
AT THE MOMENT IS BERNARD HOPKINS 
THIS IS TO DECIDE WHO IS THE BEST 
MAN FIGHTERS MAKE TITLES 
THIS IS 
TO SEE WHO IS THE NUMBER ONE AT 
LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT THIS IS THE 
FIRST TIME JOE CALZAGHE IS 
COMPETING AT LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT HE 
WAS SUPER MIDDLEWEIGHT CHAMPION FOR 
FOUR YEARS 
HE IS STILL SUPER 
MIDDLEWEIGHT CHAMPION HE HAS WON 
THEM OF FALSE ALL BERNARD 
HOPKINS MAYBE GOT A BIT HIGHER RATE 
AT THE END 
JOE CALZAGHE LANDING A 
FEW LEFT CROSSES

HE HAS THE SPONGE AND HIS MOUTH DO 
NOT WORRY ABOUT TIME HIM HE HE SEEMS NICE AND RELAXED HOPKINS IT 
SEEMS TO BE GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN 
CANCELLING JOE CALZAGHE OUTFALLS 
SOME THIS ONE IN THE BALANCE COMING 
INTO THE SIXTH AROUND 
WELSH VOICES 
RAISED IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MAN JOE 
CALZAGHE A UNANIMOUS 
AGAINST CHRIS EUBANK IN SHEFFIELD 
THAT WAS REFEREED BY JOE CORTEZ TWENTY ONE 
DEFENCES INCLUDING A DEFEAT THAT 
WAS A CLOSE CALL A COUPLE OF YEARS 
AGO THAT DEFEAT WAS A CAREER 
DEFINING THEY HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT 
JOE CALZAGHE FOR A FEW YEARS NOW 
AND HE HEARS IN LAS VEGAS HERE 
HE IS 
THAT IS THE BEST ONE HE HAS 
LANDED L. L. WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM 
LANDING MORE CLEANER SHOTS L. WOULD 
LIKE TO SEE HIM GIVING IT A BIT 
LONGER LEADING WITH THE LEFT CROSS 
CLEVER LEFT HOOK HOPKINS BUSY 
INSIDE THE REFEREE DOING LITTLE 
BIT OF HOLDING FASTER HANDS FROM 
JOE CALZAGHE HOPKINS BACKS OFF 
TRYING TO DRAW THE WELSHMAN THEN 
HAVE IN 
THAT IS WHAT HOPKINS 
DOES BEST HERE IS A MASTER RUN THE 
COUNTERPUNCH ON THE COUNTERPUNCH 
BOOING FROM THE WELSH FANS 
WE SAW A BODY PUNCH BY JOE CALZAGHE 
I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE AFFECTED 
HOPKINS BIT HOPKINS WAITING FOR JOE CALZAGHE TO LEAD OF OFF HOPKINS IS THE MAN WHO IS LEADING 
OFF JOE CALZAGHE AIDES TO STEP IN 
HE HAS TO COME IN NEEDS TO STEP 
AND FOSTER ARE COMING UP TO THE 
HALFWAY STAGE OF THIS TWELVE ROUNDER 
THE NEXT BLEMISH ON HOPKINS'S 
CAREER WAS WHEN HE LOST TO ROY 
JONES JNR A LITTLE CLASH OF HEADS 
BETTER WERE KINCAID BY JOE CALZAGHE 
GETTING VERY MESSY TOWARDS THE END 
JOE CORTEZ HAVING A WORK TELLING 
THEM TO TIDY IT UP A LITTLE BIT 
VERY DIFFICULT TO SCORE THIS IS 
ALL IN THE BALANCE GOING INTO THE 
SECOND HALF OF 
THIS CONTEST AT AT THIS STAGE IT COULD BE EVEN 
ON MY 
SCORECARD IT COULD HAVE GONE EVOLVE 
EVEN 
I THAT IS THE FIRST TIME 
THAT JOB JOE CORTEZ HAS STEPPED 
IN TO THE CORNER OF US HE HAS 
GONE TO BOWLS OF THEM BOTH OF 
THEM ENZO CALZAGHE GETTING OUT 
RATE 
HE IS NOT HAPPY WITH JOE RATE CALZAGHE AT THE MOMENT HE HAS BEEN 
A LITTLE CARELESS GOING FORWARD 
JOE CALZAGHE WE KNOW HE IS A 
TREMENDOUS TECHNICIAN HE HAS THE 
BOXING ABILITIES SO SHE SHOULD BE 
STEPPING IN THE SHOPS AND TRYING TO 
USE HIS IMAGINATION HE SUED 
SHOULD 
NOT A LOT OF LATOYA SHOULD MOVEMENT WHICH IS GOING TO SIT 
HOPKINS LACK OF LATERAL 
COMPARED TO SOME OF HIS OTHER 
OPPONENTS COME AND HE HAS HAD GOOD 
PERFORMANCES BUT HE HAS COME ALL 
THE WAY THROUGH HOW DIFFERENT AN 
OPPONENT IS 
HOPKINS HOPKINS IS THE 
BEST OPPONENT FORGET THE FACT HE 
IS FORTY FOUR HE STARTED BOXING AT A LATE 
AGE AND HAS ALWAYS KEPT HIMSELF IN 
TREMENDOUS CONDITION THIS IS BY 
FAR THE BEST FIGHTER THAT JOE 
CALZAGHE HAS FACED A DATE HE IS 
DOING A GOOD JOB PERCEIVE NO FUSS 
SUB THE FOOTWORK BY DOING A GOOD 
JOB THIS EVENING 
BUILDING UP INTO A GOOD SOLID RIGHT 
HAND INTO THE MIDRIFF 
HOPKINS DIPPING THE LEFT SHOULDER 
MAKING THE TARGET VERY DIFFICULT 
FOR JOE CALZAGHE 
YOU CAN PROBABLY COUNT THE CLEAN 
SHORTS SINCE THE OPENING ROUND WHEN 
HOPKINS GOT AS JOE CALZAGHE NOT NOT A LOT OF CLEAN SHORTS HAVE BEEN 
GOING IN TUGAY IS CANCELLING EACH 
OTHER OUT TWO GUYS NOT MEETING 
FOR A GREAT SPECTACLE IT IS A BIT 
SCRAPPY 
HE HAS BEEN FORCING THE SCRAPPY ISSUE A LITTLE BIT NOW THIS IS NOT 
A BAD ROUND FOR JOE 
CALZAGHE JOE CALZAGHE NEEDS A BIG FINISH TO THIS 
ROUND THERE IS NOT MUCH BETWEEN 
THEM HANDS DOWN THAT WORRIES ME 
JOE CALZAGHE IS PUSHING ON IN THIS 
ROUND AND JUST DOING ENOUGH TOWARDS 
THE END I HE HAS TO BE CAREFUL 
GOT CAUGHT BY A RIGHT HAND JUST 
BEFORE THE BELL THEIR JOE CALZAGHE 
STORE THAT ROUND FORCING THE PACE YOU ARE THE STRONGER MAN 
THE CALZAGHE CORNER RECKON THEIR 
MAN IS GETTING THE BETTER OF IT 
HOPKINS' SAY THAT CALZAGHE IS SAID 
TO BE TAKEN HE DID CATCH ONE OFF 
AT THE END HE WAS OFF BALANCE 
STUMBLING A DECENT ROUND THE JOKE 
OF IT 
A MUCH BETTER ROUND FROM 
CALZAGHE AND JOE CALZAGHE'S CORNER 
SEEMED PLEASED HE HAS BEEN 
SETTLING DOWN A BIT MORE SINCE 
STARTING TO BE GOING THE CALZAGHE 
WAY THINGS SEEM TO BE GOING TO 
THE CALZAGHE WAY 
COVER ANY HAS TO 
PUT A FOOT DOWN AND STUDIED UP IN 
THE CLOSING STAGES OF THIS CONTEST 
CALZAGHE IT HAS BEEN FASCINATING 
NOT TOO MUCH CLEAN NOT TOO MUCH 
CLEAR VERY LITTLE BETWEEN THEM 
HOPKINS GRINS COVER HIS SENSES 
SOMETHING AND STEPS IN THERE IS A 
BALEFUL LOOK FROM BERNARD HOPKINS 
PLENTY OF WELSH SINGING ECHOING 
AROUND THIS ARENA CALZAGHE CAMP 
CALZAGHE RESPOND HUGE SUPPORTIVE 
CAN CALZAGHE RESPOND A HUGE 
SUPPORT HERE IT HAS BEEN A TREND 
IN AMERICA THAT THEY DO PREFER THE 
MAN WHO IS COMING FORWARD SO I 
SUPPOSE SPENCER IN THAT RESPECT 
CALZAGHE BY IMPRESSING THEM A BIT 
MORE 
THEY HAVE ALWAYS PREFERRED MORE THE AGGRESSOR THAT IS IN THE 
HISTORY OF AMERICAN BOXING A GOOD 
GETTING THROUGH FROM JOE 
THE BEST SHOT FOR SOME ROUNDS NOW 
THAT WAS A NICE SHOT HOPKINS 
COMING BACK ONE OF HIS OWN HE HE RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY HOPKINS IT 
WAS A GOOD SHOT BY JOE CALZAGHE HE 
NEEDS TO WORK ON THAT AND KEYPAD 
SCORING HIS MUM A FEW MORE SHOTS 
FROM CALZAGHE THAN RESTORING THEN 
WE SAW IN THE EARLY STAGES HE 
COVERED UP WELL OR ONE VERY GOOD 
LEFT AND HE DID NOT PUT HIMSELF 
HEARD ON THE COUNTER HE DID NOT 
TAKE A BACKWARD STEP BUT THAT WAS 
ALL RIGHT CALZAGHE NOW NOT DOING 
SHOWBOATING SPENCER I DON'T THINK 
HE IS 
HE IS GROWING IN CONFIDENCE 
GETTING SUCCESS IN THIS ROUND 
ESPECIALLY WITH THAT LEFT HAND L. 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM WORKING MORE 
BEHIND THAT JAB BUT IS WHERE HE IS 
GETTING SUCCESS WHEN HE IS LEADING 
WITH THE STRAIGHT LEFT CROSSLEY IS 
GETTING CAUGHT WE WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE HIM WORKING IN BEHIND THAT JAB 
MORE FROM CALZAGHE 
HE IS COMING IN 
MORE CALZAGHE IN AND OUT VERY 
QUICKLY KEEP THE PRESSURE ON KEEP 
THE PACE UP SEVEN YEARS BETWEEN 
THEM L. DON'T THINK THAT JOE 
CALZAGHE WILL BE BOXING WHEN HE IS 
FORTY THREE YEARS OF AGE AND IT IS 
THAT HOPKINS IS DOING IT AS WELL AS 
THE YEARS TRAINING ANYTHING 
MENTAL ATTITUDE HE LOOKS LIKE A 
MAN WHO COULD RUN A COUPLE OF THAT 
MARATHONS 
HE IS A CREDIT TO THE MARATHONS SPORT FORTY THREE YEARS OF AGE AND BOXING A 
DEBATE LIKE BOXING AT THE BASE 
LIKE THIS CALZAGHE HAS KEPT THIS 
CAMERON FROM THE OPENING BELL AND 
CALZAGHE STARTING TO FIND HIS 
RANGE HE HAS BEEN OUT OF IT THIS 
EVENING 
HOPKINS CAME BACK AFTER EVENING THE BELL BUT CALZAGHE HAS A BIT OF 
A STAGGER HE PUT SO MUCH INTO THAT 
APPALLED AT THE CORNER HE HAD TO 
UP THE WORK RATE AND HE DID JUST 
THAT AND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANOTHER 
WOUND TO THE WELCHMAN ANOTHER 
ROUND TO THE WELCHMAN THE THE COMBINATIONS HE CAN'T HANDLE IT 
EXTRAORDINARY ONE BOILING HOT THE 
HAS ARRESTED GREAT FINISH BY 
CALZAGHE HAD HE HAD TO TAKE A 
CLIP TO THE MIDDLE RIGHT OF HIS JOB 
BUT CALZAGHE WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE 
FINISH 
YOU COULD SEE THE FINISH CONFIDENCE OOZING OUT OF HIM HE 
STARTED DIGGING UP THE PACE HE 
STARTED LEADING OFF WITH THAT JAB 
TAKING HIS TIME MORE WE HEARD ENZO 
IN THE CORNER TELLING HIM NOT TO 
LEAD OFF WITH IT THE RIGHT HAND 
WHERE IS THE COMBINATION HAS GONE 
THAT IS WHY JO IS GETTING SUCCESS 
BEHIND THE JAB WORKING WITH THE 
LEFT HAND AFTER THE JOB HAS GONE 
WHEN HE LEADS WITH THE DEFT CROSS 
IT IS WHEN HOPKINS IS MAKING HIM 
PAY WITH THE RIGHT HAND OVER THE 
TOP SO JOE HAS TO STICK WITH THAT 
DEB KEEP THINGS SIMPLE A THAT 
TRAP 
THE TARGET AREA IS CLOSED TRAP DOWN JOE CORTEZ BREAKS THEM UP 
TWO MODERN DAY GRADES A LOVELY 
LEFT HAND BY CALZAGHE VERY CLEVER 
LET HOPKINS COMING TO HIM ANOTHER 
ONE ON THE CHIN NOT SO MUCH IN A 
NOT ENOUGH BUT ENOUGH TO LAND 
THAT WAS SLIGHTLY UNAWARES ANOTHER 
GOOD RIGHT BY HOPKINS KEEP IT UP 
TO CALZAGHE 
HE HAS HAD TO WORK PRETTY HARD JOE 
CORTEZ STRAIGHT INTO IT BY 
CALZAGHE THAT IS ENCOURAGING 
JUSTS GOING DOWN IN TERMS OF HIS 
FOOT WORK JUST SLOWING DOWN A 
BIT OF A HOP AND SKIP A CLUMSY RED 
HAND 
BERNARD HOPKINS IS FEELING HAND THE PACE RIGHTLY SO AT FORTY THREE HIS 
PACE HAS BEEN GOOD FROM THE OPENING 
BELL CALZAGHE STILL PUSHING 
FORWARD STILL TRYING TO MAKE A 
FIGHT OF THIS AND HOPKINS JUST 
LOOKING TO COUNTERPUNCH ON THE 
OUTSIDE AT THE MOMENT

OF CONTESTS SINCE HE DEFEATED 
RONALD WINKY WRIGHT AN EXCELLENT 
LIGHT MIDDLE RIGHT CALZAGHE PUT 
ENORMOUS PRESSURE PLENTY OF WELSH 
SUPPORT COMING THROUGH JUST JUST STARTING TO GET SUCCESS WITH THE 
LEFT HAND NOW CALZAGHE BERNARD 
HOPKINS DEFINITELY SLOWED ABILITY 
BUT IN THIS ROUND AND CALZAGHE 
STARTING TO BITE SUCCESS WITH THE 
LEFT HAND STARTING TO FIND 
SUCCESS WITH THE LEFT HAND HOPKINS HOPKINS DUCKING DOWN UNDERNEATH THE A BIT 
OF CALZAGHE THE ARMPIT OF 
CALZAGHE IT HAS BEEN A BETTER 
ROUND FOR THE WELSH MAN THERE WAS 
NOT A HUGE AMOUNT COMING THROUGH 
FROM HOPKINS IN TERMS OF REAL POWER 
A LITTLE SWITCH BY CALZAGHE 
FAINTED WITH THE RIGHT WHICH 
LANDED ON THE LEFT TRYING TO 
FINISH STRONGLY CALZAGHE COVERING 
UP 
CALZAGHE LOOKING MORE UP COMFORTABLE IN THE LAST ROUND OF 
THE CONTEST HOPKINS SEEMS TO HAVE 
SLOWED A LITTLE BIT IN THE NINTH 
ROUND CALZAGHE GETTING THROUGH 
SOME GOOD SHOTS AND ANOTHER ROUND

THE SOUTHPAW AND BOTTOM OF A TARGET 
AND GOT HIM ON THE TARGET 
NOT SO 
MUCH A HAD MOVEMENT CALZAGHE IS 
FINDING SUCCESS WITH THE LEFT 
CROSSED 
THE OPENING TWO ROUNDS AND CROSSED THE CONTEST THAT WILL HAVE PUT 
CONTACT HOPKINS IN A DECENT LEAD 
BUT GRADUALLY SLOWLY INEXORABLY 
JOE CALZAGHE HAS CLAWED BACK THE 
LEAD AND HIS NOSING HIMSELF IN 
FRONT BUT IT IS DOWN TO THE PEOPLE 
AT RINGSIDE 
IT HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT CONTEST TO 
SCORE SOME OF THESE ROUNDS HAVE 
BEEN SO CLOSE BERNARD HOPKINS

THAT BAD HOPKINS SEEMS TO BE IN 
CONSIDERABLE PAIN 
HE WAS 
COMPLAINING OF A LOW BLOW HOPKINS 
I DID NOT SEE IT CALZAGHE WAS 
CERTAINLY AS HOPKINS WENT DOWN 
BUT HE SEEMS TO BE IN TREMENDOUS 
PAIN BERNARD HOPKINS 
CALZAGHE HAS 
HOLDING OUT HIS ARMS AS IF TO SAY 
DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON OVER 
THERE BUT I DID NOT DO ANYTHING 
HERE WE GO AGAIN THERE WAS THE 
RIGHT HAND WAS THERE A LOW ONE 
WELL IT WAS CERTAINLY ON THE 
WAISTLINE IT WAS NOT FAR THAT IT 
WAS NOT THAT FAR DOWN IT WAS AT 
THE TOP OF PROTECTOR AND WAS NOT 
REALLY WRITING BETWEEN THE LEGS AT 
ALL 
THE FIRST GENUINE SIGN OF EMOTION 
ON THE FACE OF THE EXECUTIONER HE 
SAYS HE HAS NOT HAPPY WITH THAT 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TOUCH GLOVES 
BECOME BORED AND CALZAGHE OFFERING 
NO APOLOGY WHATSOEVER FEELS HE 
DOES NOT HAVE TO DO THAT IS THAT 
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PLUS THE JOKE I I THINK WE HAVE SEEN IT IN THE BUILD 
UP THERE IS NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN 
THESE TWO AND THEY WILL NOT SEND 
EACH OTHER CHRISTMAS CARDS YOU CAN 
GUARANTEE THAT THERE IS A DEEP AND 
A TOUCH OF CLUBS AND A GOOD RIGHT 
HAND FROM HOPKINS TOUCH OF CLUBS 
HE HAS HAD MOMENTS TO COMPOSE 
HIMSELF HE HAS GOT BREATH BACK AND 
CALZAGHE HAS TO KEEP THE FOOD ON 
THE PEDAL ALL THE WAY THROUGH THIS 
THE FOOD ON THE PEDAL CALZAGHE 
WILL BE LOOKING FOR HIS HAND TO BE 
HELD UP WHAT A COUP THAT WOULD BE 
CALZAGHE SHOWBOATING VERY SLOWLY 
WAGGLING THE LEFT 
JOE HAS TO BE 
CAREFUL HERE YOU CAN'T ALLOW 
HOPKINS TO GET THROUGH THOSE SORT 
OF SHOTS 
JOE CORTEZ THOUGHT THAT 
WAS DELIBERATE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
WITHIN HIS RIGHTS TO DEDUCT A POINT 
FROM CALZAGHE HE EVER DID NOT SEE 
A DOG DID NOT THINK IT WAS A BAD 
ENOUGH BLOW HE EITHER DID NOT 
SEE IT OR DID NOT THINK IT WAS A 
BAD IN OF PLAY 
HOPKINS HAS PICKED 
UP THE PACE SINCE THAT KNOCKDOWN 
PERHAPS HE WAS LOOKING TO TAKE A 
BREATHER HE HAS COME BACK AND 
LOOKS REFRESHED HE IS HAVING MORE 
SUCCESS THAN I HAVE SEEN IN THE 
PREVIOUS THREE OR FOUR ROUNDS FAST FAST HANDS FROM CALZAGHE DENYING THE 
EXECUTIONER THE CHANCE TO COME IN 
AND REMOVE THAT FAMOUS ACTS AS HIS 
AND GOOD TO SEE CALZAGHE COMING 
IS RESPONDING AND 
CALZAGHE HAS IT THAT THIS WILL STOP 
HE HAS THE BIT BETWEEN HIS TEETH 
THE HE HAS HE WILL NOT BE DENIED 
WE SEE HIM PUSHING FORWARD AT EVERY 
OPPORTUNITY 
IT HAS BEEN A LONG OPPORTUNITY LONG OUT BETTER BY HOPKINS RIGHT 
AT THE END OF IT HANDS HELD THE 
LOWEST WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR SINCE 
THE BEGINNING OF THE CONTEST COME 
UP A SIGN OF TIREDNESS PERHAPS 
MAYBE HE IS TRYING TO SUCK CALZAGHE 
FORD TO GET ANOTHER RIGHT HAND 
ACROSS DASHBOARD 
ANOTHER CLOSE 
ROUND HOPKINS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN 
REFRESHED AFTER THAT LOW BLOW 
LANDED EXCHANGING WELL TOWARDS THE 
END OF THE ROUND THEY WOULD LOVE 
TO HAVE CONTINUED THEIR I THINK 
WHAT A CRACKING ROUND IRRESPECTIVE 
OF THE LOW BLOW FREDDIE STRAIGHT 
IN HOPKINS SAW HIM LITTLE SIGNS 
OF WEARINESS HEADS DOWN 
YOU HAVE 
BEEN SAYING O. K. THE LEFT AND HIS 
FLAT 
HERE WE ARE AGAIN CALZAGHE FLAT AND THEN HE WAS FORCED DOWN LOW AND 
THAT CERTAINLY WAS LOW BUT I DON'T 
THINK IT WAS DANGEROUS AND THEY 
DON'T THINK IT WAS DELIBERATE AND A 
THINK HOPKINS MADE SOMETHING OF A 
MEAL OF IT IF JOE CALZAGHE HAD 
MEANT IT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN UP 
THEY DID NOT SEEM TO BE POWER IN 
THAT SHOP HE WAS LOOKING FOR A 
RESPITE AND WE SAW IT THE WAY HE 
LOOKED REFRESHED AND LANDED A 
COUPLE OF DECENT RIGHT HANDS OF HIS 
OWN HOPKINS 
STILL VERY DIFFICULT 
TO SCORE L. WOULD RECKON THAT 
CALZAGHE HAS CERTAINLY DONE ENOUGH 
AT THIS STAGE 
YES I HAVE CALZAGHE 
THREE ROUNDS UP WITH ONLY TWO TO GO 
SO HOPKINS ON MY CARD REALLY HAS 
GOT TO PICK UP THE PACE IN THE LAST 
TWO ROUT IT IS DIFFICULT HOW THE 
JUDGES SCORING IT ARE THEY LOOKING 
FOR QUALITY QUANTITY BECAUSE 
CALZAGHE HAS BEEN THE BUSIER OF THE 
TWO THE CLASSIER SHOTS FROM 
HOPKINS WHAT HAS HE DONE ENOUGH 
THE ME NO CAS IDEAS WORKING 
HARDER 
GOOD FOR WORK LURED HIS HARDER MAN ON TO THE EDGE AND THERE IS 
PLENTY OF RING CRAFT IN THOSE FORTY THREE 
YEAR OLD LEGS AND AGILE BRAIN 
HOPKINS HAS BEEN A MAGNIFICENT 
WARRIOR OVER THE YEARS THE SAME 
CAN BE SAID PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT 
MORE ABOUT JOE CALZAGHE A GOOD 
LEFT HAND GETTING PULLED FROM 
CALZAGHE HOPKINS RESPONDING WELL 
WITH THE RIGHT HAND FOR HIS OWN 
REALLY EXCHANGING BOTH ARE BLOWN 
OUT REALLY EXCHANGING A BLOW FOR 
BLOW THAT A CRUCIAL PERIOD 
HOPKINS HAS LANDED ONE OF THE BAD 
SHOTS ONE OF A HIGHER QUALITY 
SHOTS BUT THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF 
WHAT CALZAGHE HAS DONE IT MAY BE 
WINNING HIM THIS CONTEST WAS 
STOPPED AS I SAID DO YOU GO FOR 
QUALITY OR QUANTITY 
THE QUALITY 
HAS COME FROM HOPKINS AND HE HAS 
BEEN THE ONES WHO HAS LANDED BETTER 
SHOTS BUT CALZAGHE HAS BEEN 
PERSISTENT KEPT PUSHING FORWARD 
AND AT THE MOMENT HE IS WINNING 
THIS CONTEST ON WERE GREAT THERE THERE IS ON A SHEER WORK RATE HE IS 
NOT TAKING ANY NONSENSE HE IS IT 
ROUND THE HEAD BY JOE CORTEZ THOSE 
MAM BOTH MEN SHOWING SIGNS OF 
TIRING HE IS REALLY FORCING THEM 
GOOD WORK RATE FROM CALZAGHE A 
LITTLE FOR IT LITTLE FLURRIES AND 
HOPKINS SAYS YOU DIDN'T CATCH ME 
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ARE GETTING A BIT 
OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM YOUR 
OPPONENT THEY HAVE BEEN HEARD OR 
THEY ARE NOT HAPPY OR COMFORTABLE 
IN THEIR AUNT THAT IS THE FIRST BIT 
OF EMOTION WE HAVE SEEN FROM 
HOPKINS HAS HE GONE DOWN AGAIN 
HERE COMPLAINING OF A LOW BLOW 
AGAIN CERTAINLY I SAW NOTHING 
GOING AND MELLOW L. THINK HE IS LOOKING FOR A BREATHER HERE 
IS HE A MAN UNDER PRESSURE IS HE A 
MAN WHO IS ABOUT TO LOSE LOVELY 
RIGHT HOOK FROM JOE CALZAGHE 
HOPKINS IS FURIOUS 
HE HAS TO STAY 
COOL JOE CALZAGHE HAS GOT TO HIM 
JOB AS A LEGACY MR. HAVE GROWN IN 
CONFIDENCE 
JOE CALZAGHE SEEMS TO CONFIDENCE HAVE GROWN IN CONFIDENCE AT 
TREMENDOUS ROUND THERE CALZAGHE 
STEALING THAT ROUND 
THAT HIS INTEREST INCOME BECAUSE 
AND A HOPKINS NOW THEY SAID HE IS 
WINNING THE FED 
FIGHT IF YOU 
LISTEN TO THE CORNERS YOU WOULD 
THINK THAT HOPKINS WAS IN FRONT 
THREE MORNING IT 
THREE MORE OR 
MINUTES 
HOPKINS HAS BATTLED AWAY AT MUCH 
LIGHTER THAN THIS FOR MANY YEARS 
HOPKINS WILL HAVE TO COME FORWARD 
I BELIEVE CALZAGHE IS SHEDDING THIS 
SHADING HERE COMES CALZAGHE 
JUST OVER TWO MINUTES TO BE 
ACCLAIMED AS ARGUABLY BRITAIN'S 
BIGGEST BEST BOXER ALL TIMES HE 
WOULD BE UP THERE WOULD BE GREAT 
YOU CANNOT TAKE AWAY FROM HIS 
RECORD IT IS A FEAT IN ITS OWN 
TEN YEARS UNBEATEN AS A CHAMPION 
IT SAYS LOT FOR THE MAN AND WHAT 
HE HAS DONE FOR BRITISH BOXING 
CALZAGHE IS NOT GOING TO GIVE UP 
NOW 
HOPKINS KNOWS THAT HE HAS TO NOW GET THE WELSHMAN AGAIN CALZAGHE IS 
COMING OFF THAT RING THIS IS A 
PERFORMANCE OF REAL HARD BY 
CALZAGHE HEART CALZAGHE ONCE 
THE LEAD 
I THINK CALZAGHE KNOWS 
THAT HE HAS TO WHEN AND WHEN IT BIG 
HE WAS LISTENING TO HIS DAD IN THE 
CORNER AND THAT WOULD HAVE WORRIED 
HIM 
HERE COMES CALZAGHE ALL OF HIM WALES BEHIND HIM ALL OF BRITAIN 
BEHIND HIM HERE THEY COME AGAIN 
CALZAGHE IS FIGHTING LIKE THIS IS 
VERY PERSONAL THINK IT IS ONE 
HOUR SCORECARDS IF YOU GO FOR 
QUALITY OR QUANTITY THEN CALZAGHE 
HAS GROWN MORE PUNCHES BUT HOPKINS 
LANDED SOME GOOD ONES AS WELL 
CALZAGHE THINKS IT IS CLOSE THAT HE 
IS FIGHTING LIKE IT IS SOME OF THE 
SHOTS DO OUTSIDE THE HOUSE HAD HAVE 
BEEN QUALITY SHOTS 
THE SHORT 
CALZAGHE HAS HAD CALZAGHE THINKS 
HE HAS GOT IT CALZAGHE JUMPS UP 
CALZAGHE IS UP ON THE ROPES AND 
WEAVING HOPKINS GET HIMSELF UP AND 
WAVES TO THE PHILADELPHIA 
CONTINGENT THERE IS NO DOUBT HOW 
THE CALZAGHE CAMP FEEL ABOUT THIS 
RELATIVELY UNMARKED HE HAS 
SURVIVED WHAT THE EXECUTIONER HAS 
THROWN AT M. AND AMP S. IS GOING TO BE VERY 
INTERESTING THE ON AT HIM 
I CANNOT WAIT TO HEAR WHAT THE 
SCORE KURDS THERE L. HAVE GOT 
CALZAGHE QUITE A CONVINCING WIN 
THOSE FRIENDS COULD HAVE GONE ONE 
WAY OR THE OTHER ROUNDS THE 
JUDGES COULD QUITE EASILY SEE AT 
THE OTHER WAY L. HAVE CALZAGHE 
WINNING BY FOUR THIS IS VERY TIGHT 
DO NOT FORGET WE'RE IN AMERICA 
THIS IS GOING TO BE CLOSE LADIES 
AND GENTS GENTLEMEN TO THE SCORE

UNBEATEN HAVING COME THROUGH THEIR 
TOUGHEST FIGHT OF HIS CAREER WE 
GOT UP WITH THE NEW WORLD NUMBER ONE 
IN THE LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT DIVISION 
CAUGHT UP NOTHING WAS GET IN 
THROUGH TO YOU 
THE USING THE RELAXED APPROACH WAS 
INSTRUMENTAL TO YOU GETTING DROPPED 
FOR A MAY THIRD TIME IN YOUR 
CAREER IT IS DIFFICULT THE SAFE 
SOME I GOT CAUGHT WITH A GOOD SHOT 
I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO LOOK FOR THE 
RIGHT HAND AND HE CAUGHT ME WITH A 
GOOD RIGHT HAND IT TAKES LESS THAN 
A SECOND TO LAND A PUNCH L. AM 
PROUD WITH THE WAY I GOT UP FROM 
THE PUNCH IT IS ONLY THE THIRD 
TIME IN MY CAREER I HAVE BEEN ON 
THE FLOOR L. GOT UP AND WIN ONE 
THAT IS THE SIGN OF CHAMPION L. 
FELT I WAS OUT WORKING HIM YOU 
COULD SEE IN THE NINTH ROUND WHEN 
HE FEIGNED BLOW IF YOU LOOK AT 
ITS IT WAS MORE I WAS SPINNING HIM 
ROUND AND A PROPER PUNCH SOMEBODY 
SAID THAT HE WAS GOING TO TAKE 
AROUND RAISED HE DID THE SAME 
IN THE ELEVENTH ROUND L. STILL MANAGED 
TO WIN YOU'RE CONVINCED HE DID 
ENOUGH TO WIN L. WON THE FIGHT 
THIS IS NOTHING HE SAID HE BUSTED 
ME UP THIS IS A FEW DAYS AFTER THE 
FIGHT I FEEL GREAT BELIEVING THAT

THING HE IS A SORE LOSER AND HE 
LOST THE FIGHT THREE AMERICAN 
JUDGES AN AMERICAN REFEREE WHAT 
CAN I SAY HE LOST BY ONE I WON 
WHEN IT WAS SPLIT DECISION I 
THOUGHT I COULD GET DROPPED L. 
LANDED MORE PUNCHES END OF STORY 
IT WAS NOT A PRETTY FIGHT AS HE 
WAS NEGATIVE HE WAS TRYING TO 
CHEAT THIS GUY HAD BREAK AND 
THEN ANOTHER BREAK THAT IS 
CHEATING BECAUSE HE WAS EXHAUSTED 
HE WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE A REST WHEN 
HE FELT LIKE IT 
THE HARDEST FATE 
OF YOUR CAREER IT WAS A DIFFICULT 
FIGHT BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION 
HISS STYLE DOES NOT JAR WITH MYSELF 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY HE IS AN 
INTELLIGENT PHAETON I WOULD NOT 
SAY HE WAS THE BEST FIGHTER IF I 
HAD BIFFA AND BOUGHT I CAN DO I 
WOULD HAVE STOPPED HIM PERFORMED 
WHAT I CAN DO WE'RE ALL HUMAN YOU 
CANNOT ALWAYS HAVE THE BEST 
PERFORMANCE YOU SAID YOURSELF A

MAKE THE WEIGHT THERE IS NOT A 
PROBLEM L. L. CAME INTO POUND UNDER 
THE LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT DIVISION 
MAYBE I WILL GO BACK DOWN MAYBE IT

THE MANAGES TO QUIT AT THE RIGHT 
TIME I WANT TO BE THE STORY OF

PROVED THAT HE CAN GO TO THE 
GAMBLING CAPITAL OF THE WORLD RISK
