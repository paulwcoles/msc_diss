AT SPRINGWATCH 
IT HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLY ACTIVE WEEK 
FOR ALL THE EVENTS 
THE MOST STRIKING HAS BEEN 
THE OBSERVATIONS OF SWIFTS 
NEARLY SIX HUNDRED HAVE BEEN SIGHTED 
RIGHT ACROSS THE U. K. 
THEY ARE RETURNING FROM AFRICA 
TO BREED 
THEY TEND TO PICK THE SAME PARTNER 
FOR LIFE 
AND THEY DO SPREAD THEIR WAY 
RIGHT ACROSS THE U. K. 
BECAUSE THEY TEND TO RETURN 
TO THE SAME BREEDING GROUND 
OR AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE 
FOLLOWING THE INSECTS 
YOU CAN SEE NEARLY SIX HUNDRED SIGHTINGS 
BUT WE HAVE HAD PLENTY OF OTHERS 
AS WELL RIGHT ACROSS THE BOARD 
AND THAT'S DOWN TO THE LOVELY 
WARM WEATHER WE'VE BEEN ENJOYING 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE'S MORE OF THAT 
TO COME DURING TUESDAY 
AND INDEED ON WEDNESDAY 
THEREAFTER THINGS CHANGE 
AS WE HEAD INTO TUESDAY IT'S GOING TO BE A LOVELY SUNNY DAY 
BUT IT WILL BE BREEZIER THAN IT'S BEEN DURING THE DAY ON MONDAY 
THAT'LL FRESHEN THINGS UP A LITTLE 
WE'LL NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BY THE END OF THE NIGHT 
ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES NOT SO STIFLING 
UNFORTUNATELY THAT EASTERLY WIND IS GONNA DRAG IN SOME LOW CLOUD 
THAT HAS HAMPERED THE DAY ACROSS NORTHEAST ENGLAND SLASH SOUTHEAST SCOTLAND 
KEPT THE TEMPERATURES DOWN TO TWELVE OR THIRTEEN DEGREES 
THAT'S GOING TO BE A TROUBLESOME FEATURE 
FIRST THING ON TUESDAY MORNING 
A GREY AND MISTY START WITH SOME PATCHY FOG POTENTIALLY FIRST THING 
IN EASTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND 
FURTHER WEST GLORIOUS START TO THE DAY 
IN WALES TEMPERATURES WILL SOAR IN RESPONSE TO THAT SUNSHINE 
THE SAME FOR NORTHERN IRELAND 
WHERE WE DID HAVE AN ISOLATED SHOWER ON MONDAY 
IT SHOULD BE DRY FOR TUESDAY AS IT SHOULD ACROSS MANY PARTS OF SCOTLAND 
THE HIGHLANDS LATE IN THE AFTERNOON COULD SQUEEZE A SHOWER 
BUT YOU'LL BE UNLUCKY IF YOU CATCH ONE 
HOWEVER FOR EASTERN SCOTLAND IN THE MORNING 
COULD BE A BIT OF FOG AND LOW CLOUD 
QUITE GREY AND COOL AS IT WILL BE FOR NORTHEASTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND 
THIS TIME IT COULD BE A LITTLE MORE EXTENSIVE IN THE MIDLANDS 
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'LL BE A MORNING EVENT 
RATHER THAN A WHOLE DAY EVENT 
IT SHOULD'VE CLEARED BY LUNCHTIME 
THE SOUTH ONCE AGAIN SEEING THE LION'S SHARE OF THE SUNSHINE 
AND PROBABLY THE HIGHEST TEMPERATURES 
BUT FOR ALL OF US DURING THE DAY ON TUESDAY 
BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE IN THAT EASTERLY BREEZE 
IT WILL FEEL FRESHER TEMPERATURES WON'T BE QUITE AS HIGH 
WE'VE HAD TWENTY SEVEN ON MONDAY 
TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR PROBABLY THE HIGH ON TUESDAY 
BUT NOTICE THE CLOUD DOES ERODE AWAY 
SO IT LOOKS LIKE THOSE AREAS THAT WERE DULL ON MONDAY 
SHOULD HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF BRIGHTNESS COME TUESDAY 
STILL NOT MUCH WARMER COS OF THE ONSHORE BREEZE 
TWENTY THREE SOUTHERN ENGLAND SOUTH WALES AS WELL 
GLASGOW AND BELFAST A LITTLE LOWER THAN THEY'VE BEEN TODAY 
THERE'S AN OUTSIDE CHANCE OF AN EVENING SHOWER IN SOUTHERN COUNTIES 
BUT AS THE SUN GOES DOWN SO THE SHOWERS DISAPPEAR 
AND INSTEAD THE CLOUD RETURNS TO MANY CENTRAL AND EASTERN PARTS 
WITH THE STRONGER WIND THEY'LL CARRY THAT CLOUD FURTHER WEST 
SO A LITTLE TIME TO CLEAR IT ON WEDNESDAY 
BUT MOST OF US SHOULD HAVE A FINE AND WARM DAY AWAY FROM THE EAST COAST 
IT'S ON THURSDAY THINGS REALLY START TO CHANGE 
THIS THUNDERY RAIN TO THE SOUTH 
WILL BRING A CHANGE FOR THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY 
AND THE SUNSHINE LOOKS SET TO DISAPPEAR 
THERE'S PLENTY MORE ON OUR WEBSITE 
BUT WHAT'S THE ATTRACTION
