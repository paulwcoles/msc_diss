GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TO 
TUESDAY'S WORKING LUNCH INFLATION 
IS INFLATING EVEN MORE SOARING 
FOOD AND FUEL BILLS ARE ARE TO 
BLAME AS YOU HAVE BEEN TELLING US 
FOR MONTHS NOW A CLAIM THAT THE 
RISING COST OF LIVING IS FORCING 
MORE MOTHERS TO RETURN TO WORK 
PLUS WILL DARLING BE YOUR DARLING 
TODAY HE IS GOING TO GIVE HIS 
THINKING ON THE TEN P. TAX RATE I AM 
AT IS SUSSEX TOWN WHICH WILL SWAP 
POUNDS FOR ITS OWN CURRENCY 
INFLATION HAS HAD ITS BIGGEST RISE 
FOR SIX YEARS WITH THE LATEST RISE 
YOU HAVE BEEN TELLING US YOUR 
PERSONAL INFLATION RATE IS ACTUALLY 
HIGHER THAN WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS 
TELLING US SO WHAT IS REELRY GOING 
ON WHO DO WE ASK ADAM INFLATION 
IT HAS NOW REACHED THE DIZZY 
HEIGHTS IT HAS RISEN AND RISEN AND 
IT IS NOW THREE PER CENT THAT IS THE CONSUMER 
PRICE INDEX NOT ONLY IS IT THE 
BIGGEST JUMP FOR ALMOST SIX YEARS 
BUT IF IT RISES FROM HERE AT ALL 
THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
WILL HAVE TO WRITE A LETTER TO THE 
CHANCELLOR EXPLAINING WHY HE HAS 
BEEN A NAUGHTY BOY AND NOT BE ABLE 
TO SHRINK THAT BALLOON THE 
INFLATION TARGET FOR THE BANK IS TWO PER CENT 
THE LATEST UPWARDS PRESSURE CAME 
FROM HOUSING AND HOUSEHOLD SERVICES 
THAT IS DUE TO CHANGES IN GAS 
HEATING OIL WE TALK ABOUT THAT A 
LOT ON THE PROGRAMME WHILST 
OFFICIAL FIGURES SAY ONE THING 
THERE IS A STRONG FEELING AMONG 
LOTS OF PEOPLE THAT THE OFFICIAL 
NEWS DOES NOT REFLECT THEIR OWN 
EXPERIENCE IN OTHER WORZ THEY FEEL 
THE COST IN THE RISE OF PEOPLE'S 
OWN BILLS IS MUCH MORE DRAMATDIBLG 
THAN EVEN THAT LARGE HEADLINE 
SUGGESTS DRAMATIC THAT EVEN THAT 
LARGE HEADLINE SUGGESTS IT IS TRUE 
OFFICIAL INFLATION IS AN AVERAGE 
AS A RESULT 
DO S. 
NOT REFLECT LOTS 
AS A RESULT DOES NOT REFLECT LOTS OF PEOPLE'S TRUE EXPERIENCES LET'S 
LOOK AT WHAT WE ARE MEASURING 
THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT 
MEASURES THERE IS THE CONSUMER 
PRICE INDEX THERE IS THE RETAIL 
PRICE INDEX THERE IS THE HICP THE 
PRODUCER PRICE INDEX THE SERVICES 
PRODUCE INDEX THE SPPI AS WELL 
PRODUCER PRICE INDEX THE SERVICES 
L. 
CAN GO TO SLEEP NOW THE BEST KNOWN 
ARE THE C. P. I. AND THE R. P. I. THE R. P. I. 
MEASURE ARGUABLY THE BEST KNOWN IN 
THE U. K. IT IS KNOWN AS THE HEADLINE 
INFLATION IT IS THE RATE ARGUED BY 
WORKERS TO GET PAY RISES IT IS 
USED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO CALCULATE 
THE UPRATING OF PENSIONS AND INDEX 
LINKED GUILTS THAT IS AN 
INTERNATIONALLY COME PARABLE 
MEASURE OF INFLATION C. P. I. IS 
MEASURED BY THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL 
BANK WHEN SETTING INTEREST RATES IN 
THE EURO ZONE THE BIGGEST 
DIFFERENCE IS THE C. P. I. EXCLUDES 
CERTAIN HOUSING COSTS SUCH AS 
MORTGAGE INTEREST PAYMENTS AND 
COUNCIL TAX AS WELL BOTH THE C. P. I. 
AND THE R. P. I. ARE COMPILED BY USING 
THE SAME PRICE DATA IT IS BASED ON 
A LOT OF GOODS IT IS BASED ON SIX HUNDRED FIFTY 
INDIVIDUAL GOODS ON SIX HUNDRED FIFTY 
INDIVIDUAL GOODS 
PRICES ARE MEASURED IN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY RANDOMLY 
SELECTED AREAS IN THE U. K. SO LOTS 
OF GOODS IN DIFFERENT AREAS THESE 
ARE AVERAGES AND WILL NOT REFLECT 
THE SPENDING AVERAGES OF A LARGE 
GROUP OF PEOPLE THE C. P. I. ASSUMES 
YOU SPEND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT OF YOUR MONEY ON 
HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS PERHAPS YOU 
DO PERHAPS YOU DON'T THE RE JIG 
OF THE BASKET NO LONGER CALCULATES 
LOTS OF THINGS BRIE BRUSSELS 
SPROUTS MEN'S LEATHER BOOTS THEY 
ARE OUT PERHAPS THAT IS ALL YOU 
BUY ON THE OTHER HAND COME IN ARE 
OLIVE OIL SAT NAVGATION SYSTEMS 
AND BROCCOLI 
THERE IS ANOTHER DRAWBACK TO 
CALCULATING INFLATION APART FROM 
WHAT IS IN IT THAT IS IF THE PRICE 
OF SOMETHING GOES UP PEOPLE WILL 
BUY LESS OF IT IN THE BASKET OF 
GOODS THE SAME WEIGHT IS GIVEN TO 
IT AS WAS PREVIOUSLY GIVEN THE 
BASKET IS BY DEFINITION ALWAYS OUT 
OF DATE EARLIER I SPOKE TO PAUL 
DALES AND I ASKED WHO ARE THE 
WINNERS IN THE INFLATION RATE AND 
THE LOSERS 
MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES 
AND PENSIONERS ARE DOING BADLY 
THAT IS BECAUSE THEY SPEND A GREAT 
DEAL OF INCOME ON PETROL AND 
UTILITY BILLS THEY MAY BE FACING 
INFLATION RATES OF SIX PER CENT IN CONTRAST 
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE DOING BETTER 
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU CONSIDER A YOUNG 
PERSON WHO IS EARNING MONEY BUT IS 
LIVING AT HOME WITH THEIR PARENTS 
THEREFORE NOT CONTRIBUTING TO 
ENERGY BILLS THEN THEY MAY JUST BE 
SPENDING THEIR INCOME ON THE ITEMS 
WHICH ARE FALLING IN PRICE SUCH AS 
THE LATEST FASHION NEWEST GADGETS 
WE THINK MAYHEW FACE INFLATION 
RATES OF MINUS ONE PER CENT 
AVERAGES RL 
ALWAYS GOING TO BE A COMPROMISE IF 
YOU WANT TO CALCULATE YOUR OWN 
PERSONAL INFLATION RATE YOU CAN DO 
IT THE NATIONAL STATISTICS WEBSITE 
DOES IT FOR YOU GO TO THIS WEBSITE 
WHEN YOU SEE A SEARCH BOX IN THE 
TOP RIGHT HAND CORNER YOU TYPE IN 
PERSONAL INFLATION CALCULATER IT 
WILL DO YOUR STATISTICS FOR YOU 
ARE DOING WELL WITH YOUR COLD 
YOU ARE DOING WELL WITH YOUR COLD TODAY TODAY WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THAT 
HAS YOUR COST OF LIVING GONE UP BY 
THREE PER CENT MAYBE IT HAS GONE DOWN AS YOUR 
GUEST SUGGESTED THERE LET EAST NOW 
LET US KNOW THE NUMBER OF U. K. 
SURVEYORS REPORTING FALLS IN 
PROPERTY PRICES HAS RISEN FOR THE 
NINTH MONTH IN A ROW FROM THE 
LATEST SURVEY FROM THE ROYAL 
INSTITUTION OF CHARTERED SURVEYORS 
NINETY FIVE PER CENT MORE SURVEYORS SAW PRICES FALL 
THAN RISE IN APRIL THERE HAS BEEN 
A FALL IN INQUIRIES FROM 
PERSPECTIVE BUYERS SALES ON THE 
HIGH STREET FELL FOR THE SECOND 
MONTH IN A ROW IN APRIL ACCORDING 
TO FIGURES FROM THE BRITISH RETAIL 
CONSORTIUM LIKE FOR LIKE SELLS 
FELL BY FIFTEEN PER CENT IN APRIL KAM PAIRED 
TO LAST YEAR TOTAL SALES WHICH 
INCLUDE OUTLETS WHICH WERE NOT OPEN 
LAST YEAR ROSE ONE PER CENT IN APRIL AND THE 
MANAGING DIRECTOR OF HEATHROW 
AIRPORT IS STEPPING DOWN MARK 
BULLOCK WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT 
DISASTROUS OPENING OF TERMINAL FIVE 
BACK IN MARCH HE IS SAID TO HAVE 
CHOSEN TO LEAVE AND WILL BE 
REPLACED BY THE CHIEF OPERATING 
OFFICER OF LONDON UNDERGROUND SOME 
BUSINESS LEADERS IN NOTTINGHAM HAVE 
CRITICISED A PLAN TO TAX WORK PLACE 
WORKING SPACES THE COUNCIL WANTS 
COMPANIES TO PAY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE FOR EVERY 
SPACE AFTER THE FIRST TEN IN THEIR 
CAR PARKS THE PLAN IS BEING PASSED 
BY THE CITY COUNCIL AND NOW GOES TO 
THE GOVERNMENT FOR APPROVAL THAT 
RISE IN COST OF LIVING THAT WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT ON THE PROGRAMME 
TODAY IS FORCING MOTHERS AND 
FATHERS BACK TO WORK THAT IS THE 
CLAIM FROM THE CONSUMER WEBSITE 
USWITCH WHICH SAYS THE NUMBER OF 
PARENTS WHO REMAIN AT HOME TO LOOK 
AFTER THEIR CHILDREN IS AT ITS 
LOWEST LEVEL IN FIFTEEN YEARS WE WANTED 
TO TALK TO SALLY JIMSON SHE IS 
FROM THE RESEARCH AND POLICY 
ORGANISATION THE FAMILY AND 
PARENTING INSTITUTE SALLY HOW 
MUCH OF A CHOICE IS THERE FOR SOME 
PARENTS IT SEEMS ACCORDING TO 
PRICES WE ARE SEEING TODAY ON THE 
HIGH STREET THERE IS LITTLE CHOICE 
THAT IS RIGHT THERE IS LITTLE 
HIGH STREET THERE IS LITTLE CHOICE THAT IS RIGHT THERE IS LITTLE 
CHOICE IT IS EXPENSIVE TO HAVE 
FAMILY WOMEN GO BACK TO WORK TO BE 
ABLE TO PAY THE BILLS AND MORTGAGES 
IT IS TRUE THAT LOT OF CHILDREN 
WHO LIVE IN POVERTY LIVE IN A 
FAMILY WHERE ONLY ONE PERSON IS 
WORKING SO THE WORK OF ONE PERSON 
IS NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP THE FAMILY 
OUT OF POVERTY 
WHAT OTHER FACTORS 
INFLUENCE PARENTS TO GO BACK TO 
WORK 
THERE IS MORE WORK AVAILABLE WORK NOW THAN BEFORE L. THINK THAT THERE 
IS MORE WE THINK WE KNOW THAT 
THERE IS MORE CHILDCARE AVAILABLE 
AND MORE DIFFERENT SORTS ALSO IT 
IS MORE SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE FOR 
WOMEN TO GO BACK TO WORK THERE ARE 
MORE AND DIFFERENT SORTS OF WORK 
YOU CAN DO AND DO FROM HOME THAT 
YOU COULD NOT HAVE DONE IN THE PAST 
WHAT ABOUT THE ISSUE OF FLEXIBLE 
WORKING AT THE MOMENT FLEXIBLE 
WORKING IS LIMITED TO THE PARENTS 
OF YOUNGER CHILDREN UNDER SIX 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
AND THE 
PARENTS OF DISABLED CHILDREN DO DO YOU WANT MORE ACCESS TO FLEXIBLE 
WORKING FOR MANY EMPLOYERS SMALL 
TO MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES THAT 
WOULD NOT PLEASE THEM 
IT IS ONLY 
SOMETHING THAT PARENTS SAY THEY 
WANT WE THINK IT SHOULD BE 
EXTENDED TO ALL PARENTS OF CHILDREN 
SO PARENTS OF TEENAGE CHILDREN AS 
WELL WHEN WE PARENTS DON'T JUST 
WANT THE RIGHT TO ASK THEY WANT 
THE RIGHT FOR FLEXIBLE WORKING SO 
THEY WANT THE RIGHT TO HAVE 
FLEXIBLE WORKING IF THEY WANT FOR 
IT 
I WAS INTERESTED READING IT BACKGROUND ON YOUR VIEWS YOU ARE 
INTERESTED IN CHILDREN'S CENTRES 
AROUND THE COUNTRY YOU ARE SAYING 
THERE HAS TO BE PROPER FACILITIES 
IF THOSE PARENTS THROUGH CHOICE OR 
BY THE COST OF LIVE HAVING TO 
CONSIDER GOING BACK TO WORK YES YES THERE HAS TO BE A SERIES OF 
AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE AND OF A HIGH 
STANDARD WE 
THAT IS WHAT 
IS GOOD FOR CHILDREN IS HIGH 
QUALITY CHILDCARE AND NOT JUST ANY 
OLD CHILDCARE 
WHO PAYS FOR THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT THE PARENTS 
IT HAS 
TO BE A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE 
GOVERNMENT AND THE PARENT IT HAS 
TO BE AFFORDABLE FOR THE PARENT AND 
SUBSIDISED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO 
MAKE IT AFFORDABLE FOR PARENTS IT 
THOOZ BE A TWO WAY THING HOW HOW CONSISTENT ACROSS THE U. K. IS THE 
AVAILABILITY OF QUALITY CHILDCARE 
THE AVAILABILITY OF CHILDCARE IS 
PATCHY WE KNOW THERE ARE LOTS OF 
GAPS SOME PLACES IT IS EASIER TO 
FIND QUALITY CHILDCARE SOME PLACES 
IT IS LESS EASY THERE ARE SOME 
WHICH ARE OFFERING MORE CHILDCARE 
THAN BEFORE THOSE CONNECTED TO 
SCHOOLS THERE IS INCREASING 
AMOUNTS OF CHILDCARE WE WOULD LIKE 
TO SEE MORE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
THE QUALITY TO BE MORE CONSISTENT 
AND SEE ALL SORT OF DIFFERENT 
OPTIONS OF CHILDCARE SO THEY CAN 
CHOSE DIFFERENT WAYS OF HAVING 
THEIR CHILDREN CARED FOR 
THANK YOU 
HERE AT WORKING LUNCH WE ARE ALWAYS 
THINKING ABOUT MONEY WE DON'T 
OFTEN STOP TO THINK ABOUT WHAT 
EXACTLY IT IS AFTER ALL THIS IS 
JUST A PIECE OF PAPER TO SOME 
PEOPLE IT IS A TWENTY TO ME BUT IT 
IS VALUABLE WE ALL AGREE IT IS A 
PIECE OF MONEY THAT IS HOW THE 
WORLD WORKS N. THE SUSSEX TOWN OF 
LEWES THEY HAVE BEEN THINKING 
DIFFERENTLY AND THINKING OF 
LAUNCHING THEIR OWN CURRENCY ROB 
HAS BEEN OUT TO FIND OUT WHY WITH 
REPORTS OF A WORLDWIDE RECESSION 
AND A GLOBAL CREDIT CRUNCH WE HEAR 
A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE SHORTAGE OF 
MONEY IN OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEMS 
DOWN THERE IN LEWES IN SUSSEX THEY 
ARE PLANNING TO PRINT THEIR OWN 
MONEY N. THE COFFEE SHOP HERE THERE 
IS TALK OF CHANGE IN THE AIR A 
GROUP HAS BEEN SET UP TO INTRODUCE 
THE LEWES POUND IT WOULD HAVE THE 
SAME VALUE AS STIRLING AND WOULD BE 
USED IN LOCAL SHOPS HALF WAY 
BETWEEN A GIFT VOUCHER AND REAL 
CASH THE IDEA IS TO ENCOURAGE MORE 
PEOPLE TO SHOP IN THE TOWN 
IS IS A 
SENSE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF MONEY 
THAT IS GETTING OUT OF OUR LOCAL 
ECONOMY WHEN THE ECONOMICS 
FOUNDATION DID SOME WORK IN WHICH 
THEY SAY ANY POUND SPENT IN A LOCAL 
OUTLET WAS MULTIPLYED TWO AND A 
HALF TIMES THAN ANY POUND SPENT SAY 
IN TESCOS WHERE THE MONEY WAS 
DISAPPEARING FROM THE LOCAL ECONOMY 
THE LOCAL MONEY HAS TO BE SPENT 
LOCALLY YOU MAKE THE MONEY MORE IN 
THE LOCAL ECONOMY AT THE SAME TIME 
THERE IS FINANCIAL INSECURITY 
PEOPLE ARE NOT SURE HOW THINGS WILL 
WORK OUT IN FINANCIAL SYSTEMS THAT 
IS OF COURSE FOR FEAR AND CONCERN 
A LOCAL CURRENCY IS INDEPENDENT OF 
THAT AND STRENGTHENS IT 
IT IS A 
GREEN INITIATIVE BY ENCOURAGING 
PEOPLE TO USE SHOPS IN THE TOWN 
THE GROUP BEHIND THE TOWN WANTS TO 
CUT DOWN ON TRAVELLING LEWES WAS 
HIT BY DEVASTATING FLOODS EIGHT 
YEARS AGO AND IS WELL AWARE OF THE 
DANGERS OF GLOBAL WARMING 
WE WANT 
TO RELOCALLISE AND TO STRENGTHEN 
THE LOCAL ECONOMY GROW MORE FOOD 
LOCALLY HAVE MORE BUSINESSES 
LOCALLY AND GENERATE OUR OWN ENERGY 
EVENTUALLY AS WELL 
I SUPPOSE WITH 
THE FLOODS YOU AE HAD AN EXAMPLE OF 
WHAT CLIMATE COMAING IS ABOUT DOES 
THAT MAKE PEOPLE MORE LIKELY TO 
LOOK AT IT A SIMILAR SCHEME IS 
ALREADY UP AND RUNNING IN THE DEVON 
TOWN OF TOTNES THE POUNDS CAN BE 
CHANGED INTO STIRLING THROUGH THE 
GROUP ORGANISING THE SCHEME LEWES 
AND LEWES ARE TRANSITION TOWNS 
PLACES WHERE PEOPLE PLAN TO DEAL 
WITH GLOBAL WARMING AND RISING 
ENERGY PRICES ROBERT JACKSON IS 
ONE OF THE PIONEERS OF THE TOTNES 
SCHEME 
WE HAVE SEEN OIL PRICES INCREASE 
FOUR FOLD SO WE COULD WELL BE 
LOOKING AT OIL PRICES OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A 
BARREL AND THAT WOULD REALLY PUSH 
OUR SYSTEMS TO THE LIMIT SO WE ARE 
TRYING TO GET THE INKING IN PLACE 
AND THE SYSTEMS AND THE ENERGY 
PRODUCTION EVENTUALLY IN PLACE THAT 
CAN COPE WITH QUITE POSSIBLY MAJOR 
SHOCKS TO COME 
IN FACT THE IDEA 
OF A LEWES POUND ISN'T A NEW ONE 
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS THIS IS A 
LEWES TENNER THERE WAS A LEWES 
POUND CIRCULATING ON THIS STREET 
WAY BACK MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS 
AGO BACK IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WHAT 
DO THE PEOPLE THINK OF BRINGING ONE 
OF THESE BACK 
NONSENSE LIFE IS 
CONFUSING ENOUGH NOT AT ALL 
IMPRESSED THEY NEED TO SPEND THEIR 
MONEY ON BETTER THINGS 
IF IT 
BRINGS TRADE INTO THE LOCAL SHOPS 
THAT IS FINE 
WOULD YOU SWAP ONE FOR 
A LEWES POUND 
NOT REALLY NO 
WOULD LIKE TO SPEND MY MONEY 
ELSEWHERE AND HAVE THE CHOICE TO 
SPEND IT HERE TOO 
SO DIVIDED 
OPINION BUT MANY OF THE TOWN'S 
SHOPKEEPERS SUPPORT THE IDEA I I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE 
WHO ARE LOCAL SUPPORT THEIR LOCAL 
SHOPS AND WE LIKE TO SORT OF MAKE 
LIFE EASIER FOR THEM TO DO THAT SO 
WE HAVE A LOYALTY SCHEME ALREADY 
AND WE THINK THAT HAVING A LEWES 
POUND WOULD BE A GOOD WAY OF 
PROMOTING THE OTHER SHOPS IN THE 
TOWN AS WELL SO WE ALL BENEFIT FROM 
PEOPLE DOING THEIR SPENDING HERE 
THE PEOPLE I TALK TO ABOUT IT THINK 
IT'S A GREAT IDEA WE ARE THE 
SECOND TOWN ON THE COUNTRY TO ITS 
OWN POUND BRILLIANT 
IS IT A 
HEADACHE FOR TRADERS MORE 
PAPERWORK 
IT IS ANOTHER COIN TO PAPERWORK COUNT AND ANOTHER ONE TO BANK AND 
WE HAVE TO REINSTATE IT AGAINST THE 
PROPER POUND WHICH WE CAN SPEND 
SOMEWHERE ELSE L. AM SURE THEY ARE 
PROBLEMS YOU CAN SOLVE THE THE SUPPORTERS ARE PUSHING AHEAD WITH 
THEIR PLAN AND HOPE TO HAVE THEIR 
OWN CURRENCY CIRCULATING IN THE 
TOWN LATER THIS YEAR 
I'M PUTTING MY TWENTY QUID AWAY YOU 
CAN SEND US YOUR MONEY IF YOU WANT

MADE IN SHARE TERMS ANY GAIN OVER 
THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS OVER THE SAME 
TIME THE F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED HAS DROPPED BUT

MASSIVELY UNDERPERFORMING THE 
AVERAGE WOW GLAXO UNCHANGED 
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE IS DOWN 
LOTS OF COMPANY NEWS OUT TODAY 
NORTHERN FOODS IS TO TEMPORARILY 
CLOSE ITS FENLAND FOOD PLANT IN 
GRANTHAM AFTER FAILING TO WIN A NEW 
CONTRACT WITH MARKS AND AMP SPENCER FOR 
THE SUPPLY OF READY MEALS THE MOVE

EVEN PROFITABILITY AT THE YEAR 
ENDING MARCH THIS YEAR THEY ARE

IN THE HOUSING MARKET HAVE WORSENED 
RESERVATIONS ARE DOWN FIFTY PER CENT ON THIS 
TIME LAST YEAR THEY ARE DOWN SIX PER CENT 
THE BUILDERS MERCHANTS TRAVIS 
PERKINS REPORTED A EIGHT PER CENT RISE IN 
TURNOVER BUT SAY IT EXPECTS THE 
MARKET TO WEAKEN ITS SHARES ARE 
DOWN PUBS GROUP ENTERPRISE INNS 
REPORTED A FALL IN THE FIRST HALF 
PROFITS BUT IT WAS MUCH AS WE WERE 
EXPECTING IT WARNED OF TOUGH 
TRADING CONDITIONS FIRST HALF PRE 
TAX PRE EXCEPTIONAL PROFITS DOWN 
DOWN THREE PER CENT GREGGS REPORTED LIKE FOR 
LIKE SALES IN THE NINETEEN WEEKS TO THE 
TENTH MAY UP FORTY SEVEN PER CENT AND IT SAID IT WAS 
QUITE CONFIDENT WHICH IS REALLY 
INTERESTING TO SEE NONE THE LESS 
THOSE SHARES ARE DOWN BABCOCK THE 
DEFENCE AND ENGINEERING CONTRACTOR 
HAS TALKED ABOUT AN EXTREMELY 
SUCCESSFUL YEAR FULL YEAR PRE TAX 
PROFITS UP FORTY EIGHT PER CENT AND DESPITE THAT A 
BUSINESS DOING REALLY WELL THE 
SHARES ARE STILL NOT DOWN IN THIS 
MARKET FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED HAS TO BE 
DOWN WE ARE STILL HOLDING ABOVE 
SIX THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TONNES GOING ON IN THE 
MARKETS HOWARD WHEELDON SENIOR 
STRATEGIST AT BGC PARTNERS JOINS US 
NOW WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMME WHAT 
DID YOU MAKE OF THE MARKET'S 
REACTION TODAY WAS IT DOWN BECAUSE 
OF THE INFLATION NEWS 
OF THE INFLATION NEWS 
INFLATION 
OF THE INFLATION NEWS INFLATION WE STARTED AT FORTY POINTS UP WHEN I 
LEFT TO COME TO THE CAMERA WE WERE 
FORTY POINTS DOWN IT WAS THE 
INFLATION FIGURE THE DRAMATIC MOVE 
UP TO THE THREE PER CENT LEVEL WE KNEW IT WAS 
COMING THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S 
GOVERNORS WARNED US IT WAS COMING 
THE SUDDENNESS OF THE RISE UP TO THREE PER CENT 
IS SUGGESTING WE ARE GOING TO GO TO 
THREE POINT FIVE PER CENT FOUR PER CENT BEFORE THE PEAK MAY BE 
REACHED AND BEFORE INFLATION STARTS 
TO COME DOWN L. THINK THAT IS THE 
WORRYING FEATURE TODAY AS YOU 
POINT OUT THE BANKS HAVE BEEN 
HAMMERED THE RETAILERS HAVE BEEN 
HAMMERED AND THE ONLY OTHER SAVING 
GRACE IS THE OIL PRICES HAVE COME 
DOWN A TOUCH THE TROUBLE IS THAT 
KNOCKS B. P. AT THE LIKES OF B. P. AND 
SHELL BECAUSE THEY DO WELL ON THE 
BACK OF A HIGHER PRICE OF OIL YOU YOU THINK THAT INFLATION WILL GO A LOT 
WORSE THIRTY FIVE PER CENT FOUR PER CENT 
I AM VERY 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE OVERALL EFFECTS 
OF ENERGY AND OIL PRICE RELATED 
RISES RAW MATERIAL PRICE RISES AND 
MOST OF ALL FOOD PRICE RISES I'M 
NOT IN THE CAMP THAT BELIEVES FOOD 
PRICES IS A TEMPORARY MEASURE L. 
THINK WE HAVE TO GET USED TO FOOD 
RISING AT A RAPID RATE FOR PERHAPS 
MANY YEARS TO COME SO THIS IS NOT 
GOING TO HELP THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
CAUSE 
IT'S A MIXED PICTURE ON THE CAUSE MARKETS TODAY PROBLEMS FOR BANKS 
AND REDROW BUT TRAVIS PERKINS 
BIGGER SALES AND GREGGS AND 
BABCOCKS DID WELL WE TALK ABOUT A 
LOT OF GLOOM BUT COMPANIES ARE 
DOING GOOD BUSINESS 
BABCOCK STANDS 
OUT TO ME THIS IS VERY MUCH A 
BUSINESS THAT'S IN THE SERVICES 
AREA AND OF COURSE IT IS 
SUPPORTING LONG TERM CONTRACTS 
IT'S ALSO OF COURSE GOING TO BE A 
BIG BENEFICIARY IF THE GOVERNMENT 
GOES AHEAD WITH THE TWO AIRCRAFT 
CARRIERS WHICH WE HOPE WILL BE 
CONFIRMED SOON BABCOCKS IS LOOKING 
VERY VERY GOOD INDEED THERE ARE 
SEVERAL OTHER DEFENCE RELATED AND 
SERVICE RELATED STOCKS THAT ARE 
ALSO DOING VERY WELL 
HOW CONFIDENT 
ARE YOU ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET 
LOOKING FORWARD GIVEN YOUR VIEW 
THAT INFLATION IS ABOUT TO RISE 
FURTHER 
I DON'T SEE US GOING FURTHER ANYWHERE FAST WE ARE NOT IN A 
RECOVERY MODE YET L. DO THINK WE 
ARE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE 
OVERALL AND UNDERLYING CREDIT 
MARKET CRISIS WE HAVE TO YET FACE 
THE DRIFT THAT COMES OUT IN TERMS 
OF THE ECONOMIC EFFECT THAT NEWS 
WILL GET WORST WHILST I HOPE THE 
CREDIT CRISIS MARKET NEWS WILL GET 
BETTER IN THE SHORT TERM I DON'T 
EXPECT ANYTHING OTHER THAN A 
HOVERING AROUND THE LEVELS WE ARE 
NOW BUT LOOKING INTO TWO THOUSAND NINE THAT IS 
WHAT MARKETS WILL INCREASINGLY DO 
FROM HEREON THEY WILL START I 
HOPE TO TAKE A MORE POSITIVE VIEW 
YOU 
HAVE TO 
WONDER THOUGH WHY 
INVESTORS SHOULD TAKE THE RISK OF 
THE MARKET GIVEN ALL THE 
UNCERTAINTIES AROUND WHEN THEY 
COULD CHUCK IT IN A BANK AND GET A 
GUARANTEED RATE OF INTEREST THAT THAT IS A VERY FAIR POINT WITH SHARES 
REMEMBER IF THE COMPANY IS DOING O. K. 
IF NOT GREAT YOU ARE PROBABLY 
GETTING A DECENT DIVIDEND SO YOU 
ARE GETTING A DECENT ENOUGH RETURN 
ON YOUR INVESTMENT YOU MIGHT NOT 
BE GETTING THE CAPITAL RETURN BUT 
WITH PATIENCE AND SEEING THE STOCK 
MARKET AS A LONG TERM INVESTMENT 
THEN OVERALL YOU WILL STILL IN MY 
VIEW CONTINUE TO DO WELL LOVELY LOVELY TALKING TO YOU PLEASURE THANKS PLEASURE THANKS VERY MUCH LOTS OF E. MAILS ON THAT 
INFLATION THEME A. N. N. SAYS THE 
GOVERNMENT IS HIDING INFLATION FROM 
US SHE WISHES US JOURNALISTS 
COULD FIND OUT THE TRUE PICTURE 
PHILIPPA SAYS IF THE RATE OF 
INFLATION IS A MUCH HERALDED THREE PER CENT WHY 
HAS MY DAUGHTER BEEN STUNG FOR FORTY EIGHT PER CENT 
INTEREST ON HER STUDENT LOAN 
COULDN'T THE SUPERMARKETS PUBLISH 
THEIR OWN INFLATION RATES ANOTHER 
SUBJECT WHICH GETS YOU GOING IS THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. TAX RATE THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY 
ATTACKED BY ITS DECISION TO SCRAP 
IT THE OPPOSITION MEMBERS OF 
THEIR OWN PARTY AND BY OUR VIEWERS 
THIS AFTERNOON THE CHANCELLOR WILL 
MAKING STATEMENT RACHEL LOTS OF 
PEOPLE AGAINST IT LOTS OF MUDDYING 
OF THE WATERS WHO IS SUFFERING 
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SCRAPPED THE 
LOWEST RATE OF INCOME TAX THEY 
INCREASED TAX CREDITS AND CHILD 
BENEFIT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE LOWER 
INCOME FAMILIES DIDN'T LOSE OUT AND 
BECOME WORSE OFF MORE THAN FIVE 
MILLION FAMILIES SLIPPED THROUGH 
THAT SAFETY NET IT'S ESTIMATED 
THAT IT IS MAINLY LOW INCOME 
EARNERS WITHOUT CHILDREN EARNING 
BETWEEN FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR 
AND ANYBODY WHO HAS BEEN BADLY 
AFFECTED COULD BE UP TO TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TWO YEAR 
WORSE OFF 
WHAT HAVE THE VIEWERS 
BEEN SAYING ABOUT IT QUITE A LOT 
I WOULD CONFIDENTLY SAY THAT THIS 
IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR 
SUBJECTS COMING IN SO FAR THIS YEAR 
NONE OF THEM FROM FRANK FIELD NO NO ROB MICHAELS SAYS 
ALMOST A DOUBLING OF HIS TAX BILL 
ANNETTE SENT US AN E. MAIL 
WHAT ABOUT THE THOUGHTS ON HOW THE 
GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO COMPENSATE 
THIS IS THE POINT THAT SOME PEOPLE 
LIKE FRANK FIELD THEY WANT ONE 
PAYMENT TO COMPENSATE RATHER THAN 
THE COMPLICATED EQUATIONS LINKED 
WITH THE FORMER CHANCELLOR GORDON 
BROWN 
THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF BROWN SPECULATION ON HOW PEOPLE WILL BE 
COMPENSATED THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
LOST OUT THE IDEA THAT IT COULD BE 
THROUGH THE WINTER FUEL ALLOWANCE 
SYSTEM THROUGH MORE OF THE TAX 
CREDIT SYSTEM AND ALSO THROUGH THE 
MINIMUM WAGE THE CHANCELLOR WAS 
SPEAKING TO THE CABINET ABOUT WHAT 
HE PLANS TO DO THIS MORNING THEY 
SAID THEY WILL MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT 
AT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THIS AFTERNOON A SENIOR 
GOVERNMENT SOURCE HAS SAID THAT 
THIS AFTERNOON'S STATEMENT WILL BE 
SIGNIFICANT AND THEY HAVE SAID 
IT WILL BE COSTLY SO HOPEFULLY 
THINGS SHOULD BE A LOT CLEARER 
AFTER THIS AFTERNOON THAT WILL BE 
VERY WELCOME NEWS TO A LOT OF 
LABOUR M. P.'S WHO WANT THE GOVERNMENT 
TO GIVE AS MANY DETAILS AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE AND CERTAINLY AHEAD OF 
NEXT WEEK'S CREWE AND AMP NANTWICH BY 
ELECTION 
WE AND POSSIBLY YOU WILL ELECTION BE KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THIS THIS 
AFTERNOON AND WE WILL BE REPORTING 
BACK IN SOME DETAIL ON TOMORROW'S 
PROGRAMME WE WILL ALSO BE 
ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ON WILLS 
THIS FRIDAY SO IF YOU HAVE A 
QUESTION GET THEM IN IF ADAM'S 
COLD GETS ANY WORSE I HOPE YOU 
HAVE MADE A WILL WE WILL BOTH SEE 
YOU TOMORROW
