WHEE 
OH AH HA 
WE'RE ALL DIFFERENT AND SPECIAL 
AND FROM BIRTH WE GROW AND CHANGE 
THERE'S A LOT TO DO WE LEARN TO WALK LEARN TO THROW A BALL 
WE GROW UP AND LEARN TO MAKE IMPORTANT CHOICES FOR OURSELVES 
BOO HOO HOO 
OH OW 
HA HA HA 
MARDI GRAS IN AMERICA THE BIGGEST PARTY IN THE WORLD 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM LOTS OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES 
THE CITY OF NEW ORLEANS IS AWASH WITH A SEA OF FACES 
NOW EVERYONE'S FACE IS MUCH ALIKE 
WE'VE ALL GOT TWO EYES A NOSE A MOUTH 
AND THAT'S TRUE WHEREVER YOU COME FROM 
MY NAME'S MARIO I COME FROM ITALY BUT I LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY 
MY NAME IS MICHIKO MORI I'M FROM JAPAN 
BUT THOUGH WE'RE ALL ALIKE WE'RE ALSO ALL DIFFERENT 
EVERY FACE HAS ITS OWN VERY SPECIAL FEATURES 
I'M FROM IRELAND 
I'VE RED HAIR PALE SKIN FRECKLES AND GREEN EYES 
SOME SAY THAT'S TYPICALLY IRISH BUT EVERYBODY LOOKS DIFFERENT IN IRELAND 
SO HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF MY FACE IS VERY ITALIAN 
YOU CAN SEE I'VE REAL BROWN EYES 
AND I'VE A ROMAN NOSE AND I'M VERY HAIRY 
AND MY LIPS ARE LET'S SEE 
LIKE A SWEETHEART MOUTH HOW'S THAT 
LONG STRAIGHT BLACK HAIR 
UM ROUND FACE 
YELLOWISH COMPLEXION 
SOME PEOPLE'S FACES CAN TELL YOU WHAT MOOD THEY'RE IN 
IF PEOPLE WEAR MASKS YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT MOOD THEY'RE IN 
BUT THEY CERTAINLY ALL LOOK AS THOUGH THEY'RE HAVING FUN 
NOW TAKING A CLOSER LOOK THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS IN COMMON 
WITH ME AND THE ELEPHANT BELIEVE IT OR NOT 
FOR INSTANCE THEY'VE GOT BIG LONG EYELASHES JUST LIKE WE HAVE 
THEY'VE GOT NICE BIG EYES WITH EYELIDS 
AND HE'S GOT BROWN EYES THEY CAN ALSO HAVE PINK OR GREY 
THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT COLOUR EYES IF WE GO DOWN A BIT FURTHER 
HE'S GOT A BIG MOUTH WITH A TONGUE INSIDE THERE 
THE ALL FAMILIAR BIG EAR 
NOW WE'D ALL EXPECT HIS EAR TO BE REALLY HUGE 
BUT THE ACTUAL EAR ITSELF IS ABOUT AS BIG AS MY HAND CAN YOU SEE 
AND THIS ENORMOUS FLAP OF SKIN IS REALLY LIKE MY EAR LOBE 
ONLY I DON'T FANCY HAVING EAR LOBES ABOUT THAT BIG 
AND LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT HIS FEET AH 
HE'S ACTUALLY GOT TOE NAILS ONE TWO THREE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT'S BETTER 
BUT HIS NOSE 
IS DEFINITELY A LOT LONGER THAN MINE 
AH 
M. M. M. 
URGH 
OOH HOO AH 
HUMANS HAVE FIVE SENSES 
AND WE CAN USE THEM ALL AT ONCE 
THE FIVE SENSES ARE SEEING 
HEARING 
TOUCHING 
TASTING 
AND SMELLING 
THIS ANIMAL IS A TARSIER FROM MALAYSIA 
IT CAN SEE REALLY WELL IN THE DARK TO CATCH FOOD 
BECAUSE IT HAS EYES THAT LET IN LOTS OF LIGHT 
THIS IS A MOLE MOLES LIVE UNDERGROUND WHERE THERE'S NO LIGHT 
THEY CAN'T SEE VERY WELL SO THEY USE THEIR OTHER SENSES 
LIKE TOUCH AND SMELL 
SOME ANIMALS EAT GRASS 
BUT LIONS EAT OTHER ANIMALS AND THIS ONE MIGHT BE HUNGRY 
BUT THESE ANIMALS HAVE THEIR SENSES TO PROTECT THEM OUT IN THE OPEN 
THEY HAVE EXTREMELY GOOD HEARING 
WITH EARS THAT CAN POINT IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS 
AND EYES ON THE SIDES OF THEIR HEADS TO SEE ALL AROUND 
AH HERE HERE 
OH AH 
YOU CAN TELL WHEN SOMETHING'S LIVING BECAUSE LIVING THINGS 
HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON 
THEY MOVE AND THEY BREATHE 
LIKE THIS SHARK BREATHING OUT 
ALL LIVING THINGS REPRODUCE 
THEY HAVE BABIES WHICH GROW UP TO FULL SIZE 
AND ALL LIVING THINGS NEED FOOD 
I'M HERE IN SWAMPY LOUISIANA IN AMERICA 
I'VE COME TO INVESTIGATE AN STORY 
SOME PEOPLE SAY THERE ARE ROCKS IN THIS SWAMP THAT BITE 
NOW ONLY SOMETHING LIVING CAN BITE 
BECAUSE ONLY LIVING THINGS NEED FOOD 
IT CAN'T HAVE BEEN A ROCK THAT BIT THESE PEOPLE 
IT HAD TO BE SOME LIVING CREATURE THAT JUST LOOKED LIKE A ROCK 
IT'S THE OLDEST TRICK IN THE BOOK 
PRETEND YOU'RE A ROCK AND SIT VERY STILL 
AND YOU'VE MORE CHANCE OF CATCHING DINNER 
BUT THESE ARE LIVING CREATURES THEY BREATHE MOVE 
THEY HAVE YOUNG 
THE QUESTION I HAD TO ANSWER WAS 
WHICH LIVING CREATURE WAS DISGUISED AS A ROCK 
IN THE SWAMPS OF LOUISIANA 
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU'VE FOUND IT 
WOW 
IT LOOKS LIKE A ROCK ALL RIGHT IT SURE DOES 
WHAT IT IS IS AN ALLIGATOR SNAPPING TURTLE 
THIS IS IT LOOK AT IT 
YOU DON'T OFTEN FIND THESE OUT OF THE WATER 
THIS ONE MUST BE LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO LAY HER EGGS 
THIS IS THE TURTLE THAT LURES FISH INTO ITS MOUTH 
BY WIGGLING THAT LITTLE PINK WORM AT THE FLOOR THERE UH HUH 
THE TONGUE'S LIKE A WORM 
YES I COULD SEE WHY PEOPLE WERE FOOLED BY THIS TURTLE 
SHE EVEN HAD MOSS ON HER JUST LIKE A ROCK 
BUT SHE WAS DEFINITELY LIVING 
DON'T PUT YOUR FINGERS TOO CLOSE NO 
THEY'RE CAPABLE OF DOING A LOT OF DAMAGE 
H. M. M. 
OH
