I'VE BRIEFED UNIFORM SO THE RESPONSE TIME SHOULD BE KEPT TO A MINIMUM SO GIVE US A CALL 
ALL RIGHT ANY QUESTIONS SO YOU'RE SUGGESTING WE STAND BY AND LET THE LITTLE TOERAGS DO WHAT THEY WANT 
NO WONDER THE KIDS TODAY RUN WILD NO I'M NOT SAYING THAT 
BUT YOU'RE NOT EMPOWERED TO TAKE THE LAW INTO YOUR OWN HANDS 
DAVE WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IF YOU'D HAVE CAUGHT UP WITH HIM 
GIVEN HIM A CLIP ROUND THE EAR MARCHED HIM BACK TO HIS PARENTS AND HOPEFULLY THEY'D HAVE DONE THE SAME

YOU'RE BOOKED IN WITH NURSE HALLAM I TOOK TIME OFF WORK TO SEE A NURSE WHAT GOOD'S THAT 
HE'S VERY EXPERIENCED DAVE SO HE'LL SORT YOU OUT I'M SORRY BUT I HAVE TO GO

LOOK YOU'LL BE WELL LOOKED AFTER TAKE A SEAT MR. MULLINS I'LL CALL YOU WHEN NURSE HALLAM IS READY

SOME INFORMATION HAS REACHED ME THAT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO YOU WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION 
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY TELL YOU THAT IT WOULD BE MORE THAN MY JOB ON THE P. C. T. BOARD IS WORTH 
MR. MULLINS LOOK I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP ANY OF YOUR TIME 
SO IF YOU CAN JUST WRITE ME A PRESCRIPTION I'LL BE ON ME WAY 
I'LL JUST GET UP TO SPEED WITH YOUR NOTES THEN WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO FOR YOU 
AND WHAT ABOUT THE EXERCISES 
HAVE YOU CLOCKED THE UNIFORM I GET MORE EXERCISE THAN I CAN HANDLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
I'M SURE THAT'S THE CASE MR. MULLINS BUT THESE EXERCISES 
ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO HELP MANAGE THE PAIN 
DOCTOR CLAY MUST HAVE EXPLAINED LOOK SONNY I DIDN'T ASK FOR ANY OF THIS 
I'M IN MY DINNER HOUR SO IF YOU'RE GONNA WRITE ME A PRESCRIPTION PLEASE DO IT NOW AND I'LL BE ON MY WAY 
I CAN'T DO THAT WHAT DO YOU MEAN

YOU HAVE GOT SOME INFORMATION UP YOUR SLEEVE BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL ME WHAT IT IS 
AFFIRMATIVE THE P. C. T. MUST BE IMPARTIAL AND IT WOULD BE UNETHICAL OF ME TO SHOW FAVOURITISM 
AND MIGHT THIS INFORMATION BE OF INTEREST TO THE MILL 
WELL YOU COULD SAY THAT IF YOU WERE THINKING OF EXPANDING 
AH 
SO COULD WE BE REFERRING TO 
SAY OTHER PREMISES
