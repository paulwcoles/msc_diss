FORTY MILES OUT INTO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN 
LIES A GROUP OF ISLANDS WHICH HAVE AN ALMOST MYTHICAL STATUS 
SAINT KILDA 
IT'S A PLACE OF SUPERLATIVES 
THE BIGGEST SEA CLIFFS IN BRITAIN 
THE LARGEST SEA BIRD COLONIES 
AND THE REMOTEST VILLAGE STREET 
REGULAR LINES OF STONE WALLS AND HOUSES ARE STILL STANDING 
BUT THE LAST NATIVE SAINT KILDANS LEFT IN NINETEEN THIRTY 
INCREASING CONTACT WITH THE INDUSTRIALISED WORLD 
HAD DESTROYED THEIR TRADITIONAL WAY OF LIFE 
TODAY THE HOUSES ARE EMPTY EXCEPT IN THE SUMMER MONTHS 
WHEN THEY ARE HOME TO A BAND OF CONSERVATIONISTS 
DEDICATED TO PRESERVING THE PAST 
I LOVE THE ISLAND I LOVE THE ISOLATION I LOVE ITS LOCATION 
THE PURE BEAUTY OF THE PLACE 
I'M SAMANTHA DENNIS 
I'M HERE AS THE ARCHAEOLOGIST FOR THE NATIONAL TRUST OF SCOTLAND 
MY JOB HERE REALLY IS TO LOOK AFTER 
ALL THE CULTURAL MATERIAL ON SAINT KILDA 
I GO AROUND CHECKING ON THE BUILDINGS 
ALSO REBUILD SOME OF THE WALLS WHEN THEY'RE FALLING DOWN 
BASICALLY JUST KEEP THE STANDING STRUCTURES THE BUILDINGS 
ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT BEING ON SAINT KILDA 
IS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE YOU MEET THE VARIETY OF PEOPLE 
AND THE SKILLS THAT YOU LEARN FROM PEOPLE PASSING THROUGH 
EVERYTHING FROM HANDLING PUFFINS TO RESLATING ROOVES 
TO FIXING A BLOCKED DRAIN 
YOU KIND OF FEEL A FEELING OF YOU BELONG SOMEWHERE 
YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE ELSE 
THE ISLANDS OF THE OUTER HEBRIDES 
ARE BURSTING WITH ARCHAEOLOGY AND ANCIENT MONUMENTS 
BUT THE MOST ENIGMATIC OF THEM ALL 
ARE THE MAGNIFICENT STANDING STONES AT CALLANISH ON LEWIS 
PUT UP AROUND THREE THOUSAND B. C. BY NEOLITHIC FARMERS 
YOU CAN SPECULATE TO YOUR HEART'S CONTENT 
ABOUT WHAT THESE STONES WERE FOR 
BUT THE THING THAT GETS ME IS JUST HOW OLD OLD OLD THEY ARE 
IT'S FIVE THOUSAND YEARS OLD THAT MEANS BEFORE THERE WAS ANYTHING 
BEFORE THERE WERE CITIES BEFORE THERE WERE ROADS 
BEFORE THERE WERE BIG POPULATIONS 
BEFORE THERE WERE PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT THERE WAS THIS 
MANY STONE CIRCLES ARE PROBABLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUN AND STARS 
BUT THE LAYOUT OF CALLANISH 
IS MORE LIKELY LINKED TO THE MOVEMENTS OF THE MOON 
THAT'S THE THEORY 
ALTHOUGH WE WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT WAS IN THE MIND OF THE COMMUNITIES 
THAT GATHERED HERE FOR GENERATIONS
