THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS SOME STRONG LANGUAGE 
WELCOME TO ANOTHER INSTALMENT OF THE COMEDY MAP OF BRITAIN 
WITH ME ALAN WHICKER 
THE SAT NAV VOICE YOU MIGHT LIKE TO HAVE ON YOUR DASHBOARD 
BUT CAN'T 
LAST WEEK WE OPENED THE SERIES IN THE HEART OF ENGLAND 
NOW WE MOVE ON TO POINTS NORTH 
TONIGHT WE'RE IN SCOTLAND FOR A LAUGH IN THE LOWLANDS 
A HOOT IN THE HIGHLANDS AND NO DOUBT A GIGGLE IN THE GLENS 
WHOA 
AAH 
JOHNNY VEGAS REVISITS HIS POTTY PAST 
THE MOST HARDENED OF HECKLERS WOULD JUST GO 
RHONA CAMERON ENJOYS SOME FLAGELLATION WITH THE GIRL GUIDES 
DOES THIS RING ANY BELLS 
DONKEY RIDING DONKEY RIDING 
WE DISCOVER THE SCOTTISH SCHOOL THAT INSPIRED SAINT TRINIAN'S 
THERE WAS NO SCHOOL LIKE IT IT WAS A ONE OFF IT WAS WONDERFUL 
AND DOON MACKICHAN TAKES THE HIGH ROAD BACK TO FIFE 
BAGPIPES PLAY 
BUT FIRST TO EDINBURGH 
AS HISTORIANS OF HUMAN KNOW 
THE EDINBURGH FRINGE IS A MAJOR LANDMARK ON THE COMEDY MAP 
THE FESTIVAL IS STAGED HERE IN MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED VENUES 
SOME LARGE LIKE THE MEADOWBANK STADIUM 
SOME SMALL LIKE DOCTOR ROBERT'S MAGIC BUS 
ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS THE GILDED BALLOON ON COWGATE 
IS SADLY NO MORE 
IT BURNT DOWN IN TWO THOUSAND TWO AND THE VENUE'S NOW AN EMPTY SHELL 
BUT IT GAVE A BIG BREAK TO A CHUBBY CHAPPIE WITH A BUBBLE PERM 
IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN YOU WERE 
THE KING OF EDINBURGH 
I KNOW BUT YOU KNOW WHAT 
CAN I BE REALLY HONEST WITH YOU 
WHAT YEAH 
I'M QUIETLY REALLY ANGRY WITH YOU THAT IT'S GOT TO THIS 
I NEVER DID THAT NO I KNOW YOU DIDN'T PERSONALLY 
LOOK AT IT I WAS GOING TO BRING MY SON BACK HERE ONE DAY 
WELL I'M GOING TO TRY AND REBUILD IT IF I CAN 
I WAS GOING TO SHOW HIM YOU KNOW WHERE YOU GO THIS IS WHERE 
WHERE IT ALL STARTED 
THIS IS WHERE YOUR PRIVATE EDUCATION STARTED SON 
AND THAT'S WHY YOU NOW WON'T TALK TO ME 
IT'S CLEAR EDINBURGH'S HAD ONE OF ITS WORST TOWN CENTRE FIRES FOR YEARS 
THE NIGHT SKY ABOVE EDINBURGH WAS ILLUMINATED BY THE BLAZE 
IT STARTED ABOVE A NIGHTCLUB AND SOON SPREAD 
A WELL KNOWN EDINBURGH FESTIVAL VENUE THE GILDED BALLOON WAS AMONG THE BUILDINGS BURNT OUT 
OH THIS IS LOOK AT ALL THIS BUT IT'S TRAGIC 
IT WASN'T EVEN HERE THAT STARTED IT WAS NEXT DOOR 
BUT IT SPREAD LIKE WHAT DID START IT 
IT WAS IN A LIFT SHAFT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OPENED THE DOOR 
AND IT JUST WENT WHOOSH RIGHT ALONG RIGHT ALONG THERE 
AND THEN EVERYTHING CAVED IN 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PLEASE WELCOME ALL THE WAY 
FROM HIS BUTLINS TOUR 
THE ONE THE ONLY 
JOHNNY VEGAAAAAS 
THERE WAS A LARGE THING ON STAGE COVERED WITH A CLOTH 
AND JOHNNY WOULD GO ON STAGE AND HE WOULD BUILD UP HIS COMEDY 
AND HE'D PICK ON PEOPLE BUT ALWAYS IN AN INCREDIBLY FUNNY WAY 
AND IT WASN'T LIKE GAGS AND PUT DOWN 
IT WASN'T PUT DOWN HUMOUR IT WAS ALL THE PUT DOWN WAS ON HIMSELF 
YOU CANNOT INSULT ME 
GOD GOT THERE FIRST 
GOD PUT ME ON THIS EARTH WITH AN INTELLIGENT MIND 
AND THE ABILITY TO APPRECIATE WOMEN 
BUT NOT WITH THE OUTWARD ABILITY TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN 
AND THEN WHAT HE WOULD START SAYING IS 
WHAT I REALLY WANT TO BE IS A POTTER 
HE WOULD GRAB THE CLOTH 
AND WHAT WAS THERE UNDERNEATH THE CLOTH WAS A POTTER'S WHEEL 
FUCKIN' ELL 
OH MAN 
AND YOU WOULD SEE HIM GETTING VERY SERIOUS AT THIS POINT 
BECAUSE ACTUALLY WHEN HE GETS ON TO THAT WHEEL 
THAT IS HIS LOVE HIS PASSION 
CONTESTANT NUMBER TWO JOHNNY VEGAS HOW YOU DOING 
I'M ALL RIGHT DANNI HOW ARE YOU 
GOOD WHAT DOES IT SAY HERE ABOUT YOU 
FAMOUS FOR MUSICAL NOISE HATES COMEDIANS WHO STEAL HIS GAGS 
I LOVE COMEDIANS AND I LOVE POTTERY 
I'VE DEVOTED MY LIFE TO CLAY 
I'D BETTER PUT ON UARGH 
HE USED TO USE TWO PINTS OF BEER 
DOING THE MAKING THE 
WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE WATER 
BUT IT WAS GETTING THE FAIR SHARE AS WELL 
BECAUSE ONCE IT STARTED GETTING INTERESTING JOURNALISTS STARTED COMING 
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT BIT OF GETTING 'EM UP AND GOING 
I WAS JUST GOING HEY I'VE MADE YOU A PEN HOLDER 
I'VE MADE YOU A PEN HOLDER AND YOU CAN STICK YOUR PENS IN THAT 
RATHER THAN TRYING TO POISON PEOPLE'S CAREERS 
ACTUALLY I'VE ALREADY BALLSED IT 
COME HERE 
COME ON BABY BE GOOD TO DADDY THERE'S CAMERAS HERE 
IT WOULD MESMERISE DRUNKS 
POLICEMEN SHOULD HAVE POTTERS' WHEELS AND NOT TRUNCHEONS 
BECAUSE THE MOST HARDENED OF HECKLERS WOULD JUST GO 
DURING THE EVENING HE WOULD PICK A COUPLE 
HE WOULD GET THE GUY UP AND MAKE A FOOL OF HIM TRYING TO DO POTTERY 
AND OF COURSE IT WOULD ALWAYS GO EVERYWHERE AND YOU KNOW 
BEER WOULD GO EVERYWHERE AND THEN HE WOULD ASK THE GIRL UP 
GO ON YOU GET ON HAVE A GO JUST HAVE A GO I CAN'T 
HE WOULD SIT THE GIRL DOWN HE WOULD SIT BEHIND HER 
AND PUT HIS ARMS ROUND HER AND R. 
OH YOU SEE I'VE ALREADY BALLSED IT UP 
AND THE MUSIC FROM THE FILM GHOST WOULD COME UP UNCHAINED MELODY 
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE'D BE CUDDLING INTO HER 
AND POURING THE LAGER OVER HER HANDS AND IT WAS JUST BRILLIANT 
TEASE IT OUT OF ITS HIDING PLACE 
BY THIS TIME HE HAD BUILT UP SUCH A RAPPORT WITH THE AUDIENCE 
THAT THEY'D ALL FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HIM 
THE BOYS AND THE GIRLS YOU KNOW 
WITHOUT QUESTION HE HAD THE AUDIENCE IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND 
MAKE IT YOURS 
HELP ME KAREN 
KAREN GIVE IN 
IT'S LIKE THE DARK SIDE 
I'M NOT MEANT TO BE LAUGHING THIS IS VERY SERIOUS 
IT IS THEY'LL SAY YOU KNOW 
SHE HAD A FIRE AND LOST HER BUSINESS I KNOW 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TRYING TO MAKE PORN POTTERY SICKENING RIGHT 
IF I DON'T TOUCH IT ANY MORE IT'LL STAY 
I'VE BEEN SMILING FOR A DAY AND A HALF WHEN I WERE COMING HERE 
AND NOW IT'S DEAD DEPRESSING TO SEE IT LIKE THIS 
LATER ON I'LL HAVE A BIG SMILE ON MY FACE 
AND TEARS ROLLING DOWN MY CHEEKS 
BUT THIS ALL THIS WAS WE PAINTED ALL ENQUIRIES 
WHERE DID IT ALL GO WRONG 
WHERE DID IT ALL GO WRONG 
I WANT ANSWERS 
I WANT ANSWERS I'M NOT MAD 
OH HELLO OFFICER 
WHERE IS LOVE 
DOES IT COME FROM SKIES ABOVE 
IS IT UNDERNEATH 
THE WILLOW TREE 
THAT I'VE BEEN DREAMING OF 
HI HOW ARE YOU DOING RIGHT YES 
YEAH AND THIS WAS A CAFE 
EVERY YEAR HUNDREDS OF COMEDIANS HERE AT THE EDINBURGH FRINGE 
VIE FOR AUDIENCES' PLAUDITS AND BIG PRIZES 
ONE WOMAN WHO'S SEEN IT ALL AND WON THE ULTIMATE PRIZE THE PERRIER 
IS JENNY ECLAIR 
HERS IS A LONG JOURNEY THAT BEGAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE 
AT THAT VERY MALE BASTION THE MASONIC LODGE 
SO HERE I AM WHERE IT ALL STARTED 
I WAS GIGGING HERE AT MASONIC LODGE ON HILL STREET THIS IS IT 
THIS IS VERY FUNNY 
HA IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT LOOKED I MEAN 
IT WAS A VENUE COS OBVIOUSLY 
THERE WAS BLACK CURTAINING AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING AND IT WAS DARK 
DO YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT I LOOKED LIKE 
DUH DUH DUUUH 
I CAN STILL DO THAT MOVE AS WELL 
WHEN I FIRST MET JENNY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO SHE WAS THEN A POETESS 
AND SHE DID A VERY CHARMING SLIGHTLY SORT OF DITZY ACT 
SORT OF OOH 
I'VE GOT SOME OLD POEMS IN HERE 
THIS ONE ABOUT MY FINGERNAILS COLLECTING ONE WEEK THE INGREDIENTS 
NECESSARY FOR BUBBLE AND SQUEAK BUT I WON'T DO THAT ONE 
THE AUDIENCE FOUND HER VERY WARM VERY CHARMING 
SLIGHTLY ECCENTRIC IN A KIND OF LOVABLE WAY 
SHE WAS A NICE FLUFFY POINT IN THE BILL 
LISTEN LOVE IF YOU LIKE MANGE TOUT JUST HELP YOURSELF 
AND HE SAID WHAT ME YOU AND WHO ELSE I SAID NO NO SILLY 
MANGE TOUT IS A KIND OF PEA NOT SEX FOR THREE 
AND THEN HE ACCUSED ME OF BEING PETTY AND BOURGEOIS ABOUT PETIT POIS 
WHAT MOI 
LET ME FIND ANOTHER ONE 
THAT ONE'S NOT VERY GOOD ERM 
NO THAT'S VERY BAD 
I DON'T LIKE THAT ONE EITHER QUITE EMBARRASSED I WAS VERY YOUNG 
AH THIS ONE'S CALLED THE JOKER IT'S ABOUT A BOY 
YOU CAN'T PULL THE WOOL OVER MY EYES 
HE SAID PUTTING ON HIS ACRYLIC BALACLAVA 
WELL THIS NEW DYNAMIC IMAGE CERTAINLY IS CATCHING ON 
BUT IT DOES SEEM TO HAVE HAD ONE OR TWO RATHER NASTY SIDE EFFECTS 
SO I'VE DONE THE MASONIC LODGE 
A COUPLE YEARS LATER I FIND MYSELF A LITTLE BIT FURTHER UP THE HILL 
HERE GUESS WHAT IT IS 
IT'S A CHURCH 
NOW SEE THAT PULPIT AT THE BACK THERE 
THAT'S WHERE MY SOUND ENGINEER SQUATTED 
AND HER NAME WAS RHONA CAMERON SHE'S A SCOTTISH COMEDIENNE 
BUT AT THAT AGE TWENTY ODD 
SHE WASN'T A COMEDIENNE SHE WAS MY SOUND ENGINEER 
AND THEY SACKED HER BECAUSE SHE MISSED THE SOUND CUES 
COS SHE WAS DRAWING ME IN A SKETCH BOOK I THINK SHE HAD A CRUSH 
THIS COMPANY WAS SO RIGHT ON THEY REPLACED HER WITH A DEAF GIRL 
AND I HAD TO POKE THE DEAF GIRL WITH A BROOM 
POKE HER POKE HER 
AND THEN WHAT THEY'D DO AFTERWARDS WAS 
THEY'D HAVE LESBIAN VEGETARIAN BARBECUES 
FOR VEGETARIAN LESBIANS DOWN IN A SORT COURTYARDY BIT 
I DIDN'T GO 
I WASN'T INVITED 
NOW THIS IS A VENUE THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME 
THIS IS THE PLEASANCE AND THIS IS WHERE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE 
I ACTUALLY GOT WHAT I SET OUT TO GET IN THE FIRST PLACE 
WENT TO THIS PARTY THE OTHER NIGHT I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS FANCY DRESS 
EVERYONE THOUGHT I'D COME AS MYRA HINDLEY 
JENNY COMPLETELY REINVENTED HERSELF IT WAS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY 
IT WAS LIKE SHE JUST JUNKED EVERYTHING SHE'D BEEN DOING BEFORE 
AND YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE SEE PEOPLE DEVELOP 
YOU WATCH THEM CHANGING OVER A PERIOD 
BUT JENNY KIND OF BURST BACK WITH THIS TOTALLY NEW PERSONA 
AND THERE'S THIS SEX SURVEY IN BELLA YOU KNOW THE KIND OF THING 
WHAT WOMEN LOOK FOR IN A MAN 
WHICH IS APPARENTLY A SENSE OF HUMOUR 
SHE TOOK THE AUDIENCE ON SHE KIND OF WENT OUT THERE SPOILING FOR A FIGHT 
WHAT DO WE WANT GIRLS 
FAT COCK FAT WALLET 
JENNY WAS DOING A VERY UPFRONT ACT 
A LOT OF IT ABOUT WOMEN AND SEX BUT A WOMAN WHO WASN'T PASSIVE 
DUH DUH DUUUH 
THIS IS WHERE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THIS IS THE PLEASANCE CABARET BAR 
NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THIS IS WHERE I WON THE PERRIER 
OH YES AND DO YOU KNOW IT WAS ABOUT TIME 
ISN'T IT GHASTLY ABOUT ROBBIE LEAVING TAKE THAT 
I STILL WANT HIM 
I'M STILL GONNA GET HIM 
I'M STILL STALKING HIM AND WHEN I GET HIM 
I'M GONNA SLAP ALL THE SEXUAL AMBIGUITY OUT OF HIM 
SOME WOMEN FOUND IT QUITE SHOCKING IT WAS LIKE OOH 
SHE'S A BIT TOO HARD TO TAKE FOR ME 
AND OTHERS IT WAS LIKE WOW YOU KNOW GOSH SHE'S REALLY GOT GUTS 
THAT BOY IS GOING TO WAKE UP TO FIND FIFTEEN STONE 
OF RECENTLY HYSTERECTOMISED WOMAN WITH PROLAPSE SITTING ON HIS FACE 
IT'S GOING TO BE ME 
IT'S ME ROBBIE IT'S JEN JEN 
GO ON THEN RELIGHT MY FIRE 
THE THING WAS THAT I'VE BEEN DOING SOLO STAND UP SHOWS SOLIDLY SINCE EIGHTY THREE 
DESPERATELY WANTING TO GET THE PERRIER IT WAS MY HOLY GRAIL 
SHE MADE EVERYBODY FROM AUDIENCES TO THE JUDGES 
TO ALL THE INDUSTRY PEOPLE THAT COME TO EDINBURGH 
JUST SIT UP AND COMPLETELY RETHINK WHAT THEY THOUGHT ABOUT HER 
IT'S OVER EXCITING AND I'M CHUFFED TO PIECES 
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME 
BOTH OF US HAVE BEEN AROUND FOREVER HAVEN'T WE WE HAVE INDEED YEAH 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS IT'S ALMOST FOR SERVICES RENDERED KIND OF THING 
IT'S LIKE I AM THE OLD DOG OF THE CIRCUS 
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE YEARS WHERE I THINK 
THEY COULDN'T NOT GIVE IT TO A WOMAN 
IT WAS GETTING EMBARRASSING 
IT WAS LEE EVANS THAT WAS DOING THE PRESENTING 
HE STARTED SAYING THIS STUFF LIKE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT A ONE HIT WONDER 
AND I THOUGHT OOH YOU MEAN IT'S ABOUT SLOGGING 
AND HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT COMING BACK 
TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND I THOUGHT HOLD ON IT'S MY THIRTEENTH YEAR 
WILL YOU PLEASE WELCOME ONTO THE STAGE 
AND THIS YEAR'S NINETEEN NINETY FIVE PERRIER AWARD WINNER 
JENNY ECLAIR 
MY NAME IS ANNOUNCED IT GOES IN SLOW MOTION 
IT WAS FLASH BULBS IT WAS BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE 
AND IT WAS A GLORIOUS MOMENT 
APART FROM THE BABY'S HEAD CROWNING 
UP TO THAT POINT IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST MOMENTS IN MY LIFE 
MY SKIRT'S TOO SHORT I FEEL LIKE AN ARSE 
I FEEL LIKE THE FIRST BLONDE IN SPACE 
AND THEN IT ALL WENT HORRIBLY WRONG AFTER THAT OF COURSE 
AND I STARTED DRINKING CHAMPAGNE AND THEN IT ALL GETS A BIT BLURRY 
AND THEN I REALISE THAT I REALLY REALLY HAD TO GET HOME 
AND I COULDN'T GET A CAB 
EVERYTHING WAS WRONG AND I DIDN'T WANT THE BOUQUET I WANTED TO GO HOME 
I WAS SITTING ON THE PAVEMENT CRYING 
I WAS A MESS I WAS AN ABSOLUTE MESS 
AND I JUST THOUGHT OH 
WINNING ISN'T AS EASY AS YOU THINK IT WAS HORRIBLE 
STAYING IN EDINBURGH A NUMBER THIRTY THREE BUS 
TAKES US A FEW STOPS DOWN THE DALKEITH ROAD 
TO CONFRONT A GOTHIC STRUCTURE BENEATH ARTHUR'S SEAT 
SURELY THIS OMINOUS PLACE HAS NO PART IN BRITAIN'S COMEDY HERITAGE 
WRONG TIME TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL 
THIS IS THE REAL SAINT TRINIAN'S THE ORIGINAL 
LOOK AT IT 
I MEAN I JUST WANTED TO COME BACK COS IT'S SEVENTY YEARS SINCE I WAS THERE 
IT'S A LOVELY BUILDING THAT'S WHAT'S WONDERFUL 
AND IT'S FASCINATING TO HAVE BEEN A SAINT TRINNEANITE 
WHAT DO I HEAR 
THE OLD GIRLS THE OLD GIRLS 
YES 
AND ALL IN PRIMED CONDITION 
SOAPY 
IT WAS UNLIKE ANY KIND OF EDUCATION I'D EVER HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH 
WELL PRACTICAL THINGS LIKE CHEMISTRY PROVE SUCH A NATURAL OUTLET I ALWAYS THINK 
OH 
THERE WAS NO SCHOOL LIKE IT IT WAS A ONE OFF IT WAS WONDERFUL 
I WARNED HER TO BE CAREFUL OF THAT NITROGLYCERIN 
MY DEAR 
AND OF COURSE YOU NOTICE 
THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SPELLING OF THIS OUR SAINT TRINNEANS AND THE 
RONALD SEARLE'S CARTOONS OF SAINT TRINIAN'S WERE INSPIRED 
BY CECILE JOHNSTON 
WHO WAS AT SCHOOL WITH ME 
AND I THINK I HAVE AN OLD PHOTOGRAPH HERE 
CECILE JOHNSTON AGED ABOUT ELEVEN HERE 
AND HER SISTER PAT 
ALONG AT THIS END 
RONALD SEARLE FIRST MET THESE GIRLS WHEN HE WAS STATIONED 
IN THE SMALL TOWN WHERE THEY LIVED DURING THE WAR 
AND OF COURSE HE WAS DOING CARTOONS 
AND LOVED THE STORIES THAT THEY TOLD HIM ABOUT SAINT TRINNEANS 
MAKING ALLOWANCE FOR THE WEIGHT 
ACCORDING TO MY RECKONING ARAB BOY RAN AT TRIAL TEN SECONDS FASTER 
THAN THE HORSE THAT WON THE GOLD CUP LAST YEAR 
WHY WE'VE GOT TO GET OUR MONEY ON BEFORE THE NEWS LEAKS OUT 
WHY BECAUSE THE PRICE WILL DROP LIKE A STONE WHEN IT DOES 
DON'T YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RACING NOT MUCH 
IT'S TIME YOU DID AT YOUR AGE 
OH I LIKE THAT ONE 
CYNTHIA DON'T BE GREEDY 
WHAT IS SHE TAKING AWAY 
LOWER AWAY 
HERE IT COMES FLASH 
WHACK IT UP GIRLS 
BUNG THE BALL THROUGH LIFE'S GOALPOSTS AT THE CALL 
WHO CAN STAY THE ISLAND BLOOD 
RUB THEIR BUSTLES IN THE MUD 
GALLANT HEARTS AND BULLDOG PANS 
FLOREAT SAINT TRINIAN'S 
COME ON SAINT TRINIAN'S WHERE IS YOUR SPIRIT 
GIRLS CHANT 
SAINT TRINIAN'S 
WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE THE DINING WAS UP THERE 
AND EVERYBODY RAN DOWN THIS CORRIDOR 
AND I WAS ABSOLUTELY KNOCKED FOR SIX 
GO ON GIRLS OFF YOU GO TO BED NO MESSING ABOUT 
I HAD A BIG EGG ON HERE AND THAT WAS THAT 
AND I DON'T THINK I EVER GOT MY TUCK 
HERE I AM AGAIN ALWAYS AT THE END OF THE ROW 
WITH LONG HAIR 
OUR SKIRTS WERE AT A PROPER LENGTH 
NOT AT THE SAINT TRINIAN'S LENGTH 
WHICH WAS VERY SHORT SHOWING A BIT OF LEG AND THE SUSPENDERS 
BOLDLY ON YOUR WAY 
NEVER ONCE FORGETTING THERE'S ONE BORN EVERY DAY 
LET OUR MOTTO BE BROADCAST GET YOUR BLOW IN FIRST 
BINGO 
THE BATHROOM 
AND THIS IS IT 
AND I HAD A BATH HERE SEVENTY YEARS AGO 
LISTEN 
TERM HAS BEGUN 
I COULD YODEL NOBODY WOULD TELL ME TO KEEP QUIET 
AND I WAS PRIVATE IN THIS BATH 
AND I COULD LOCK THE DOOR AND I COULD YODEL 
MY NAME IS FRITTON MILLICENT FRITTON I'M HEADMISTRESS HERE 
HERE'S OUR HEADMISTRESS CATHY FRASER LEE 
SHE PUT THE FEAR OF GOD IN PEOPLE 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME SHE HAD A VERY GENTLE AIR ACTUALLY 
AND IF SHE LIKED YOU YOU WERE ON A WINNING STREAK 
WELCOME TO SAINT TRINIAN'S 
YOU'LL FIND US ALL ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY HERE 
THAT'S ALASTAIR SIM AND THERE'S MISS FRASER LEE 
I MEAN YOU KNOW THERE IT IS POOR OLD GIRL 
WHEN POOR FREDA AND I STARTED THE SCHOOL 
DURING THE GENERAL STRIKE OF NINETEEN TWENTY SIX 
WE VOWED TO MAKE IT THE HAPPIEST CAREFREE ESTABLISHMENT IN THE WHOLE OF BRITAIN 
IT WAS A TERRIBLY CLEVER BIT OF CASTING I THINK 
HE WAS ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY BETTER LOOKING THAN MISS LEE 
IN THE PICTURE WE'VE GOT HE'S QUITE PRETTY 
GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS THIS REALLY IS TOO MUCH 
THE HONOUR OF THE SCHOOL HAS SUFFERED ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY 
DON'T IMAGINE FOR ONE MOMENT THAT I DON'T KNOW WHO DID IT 
WE COULD SPEND JOLLY HOURS WANDERING EDINBURGH'S AVENUES AND ALLEYWAYS 
BUT MUST MOVE NORTH ACROSS THE FIRTH OF FORTH AND UP THE A NINE FIFTEEN 
TO ANOTHER EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENT 
WE'RE HEADING FOR SAINT ANDREW'S HOME OF THE ROYAL AND ANCIENT GOLF CLUB 
AND PRINCE WILLIAM'S UNIVERSITY 
IT'S ALSO HOME TO MADRAS COLLEGE 
NEVER FORGOTTEN BY FUNNY LADY DOON MACKICHAN 
WHO BOARDED HER SCHOOL BUS EVERY MORNING HERE IN LARGO 
I'M A BEAUTIFUL LADY WITH HUGE BREASTS 
COME COME ABOARD THE LOVE TRAIN 
I'M GLAD I WAXED MY BIKINI LINE I DON'T NEED TO BOTHER 
I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S GOING TO NOTICE A FEW LITTLE WISPS 
WE ARE NOW IN FIFE IN LARGO 
WHICH IS WHERE I MOVED WHEN I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD 
I GREW UP IN LONDON AND THEN MY DAD WANTED TO GET BACK TO HIS ROOTS 
SO LOCK STOCK AND BARREL WE ALL MOVED UP HERE 
YOU KNOW SCOTLAND 
IT'S THE BIT THAT'S STUCK ON THE END OF ENGLAND TO STOP IT FRAYING 
FIRST DAY I SAT ON THIS BUS I WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED 
AS MORE AND MORE SCHOOLCHILDREN GOT ON FROM THE DIFFERENT FARMS THAT WE PASS ALONG THE WAY 
AND NO ONE SPOKE TO ME AT ALL 
IN FACT I WAS FROWNED AT AND LAUGHED AT 
I DON'T THINK I WAS SPAT AT BUT ALMOST 
WHEN THEY REALISED I HAD A VERY ENGLISH ACCENT 
WHEN WE GOT HALFWAY THROUGH THE JOURNEY TO SCHOOL 
THE NOISE LEVEL WOULD RISE INSANELY BECAUSE WE WOULD PASS 
LES MCEWAN'S HOUSE FROM THE BAY CITY ROLLERS 
AND THE MINUTE WE GOT NEAR LES'S HOUSE 
EVERYBODY WOULD GET THEIR TARTAN SCARVES ONTO THEIR WRISTS 
LIKE SO 
AND THEN PUMMEL VERY HARD AT THE WINDOW SHOUTING 
LES LES LES I LOVE YOU LES 
BYE BYE BABY BABY GOODBYE 
BYE BABY BABY BYE BYE 
WE'RE HERE 
OH MY GOD THIS IS IT 
DON'T TELL ME YOU'VE GOT THE SCOTTISH PIPERS HERE 
BAGPIPES PLAY 
LISTEN TO THAT LISTEN TO THAT 
NOW WE DIDN'T ASK FOR THEM TO COME 
THEY JUST HAPPENED TO BE HERE 
ON THE DAY I COME BACK TO MY SCHOOL I FEEL QUITE EMOTIONAL 
SO MY FIRST MORNING AT SCHOOL GOT HERE VERY VERY EARLY 
AS THE PLAYGROUND FILLED UP 
I WAS WAITING HERE THINKING THIS IS THE FRONT DOOR 
AND I REMEMBER BEING COMPLETELY CRUSHED UP AGAINST THIS GLASS 
WITH KIDS LITERALLY JUST PUSHING AND SHOVING 
LIKE YOU'RE IN THE FRONT OF A BAY CITY ROLLERS CONCERT OR SOME TERRIBLE MOSHPIT 
THINKING PLEASE DELIVER ME FROM THIS HELL 
I WAS BROUGHT INTO THIS CLASSROOM AND SAT DOWN AT A TABLE 
AND GIVEN AN ABILITY TEST WHICH CONSISTED OF UM 
A LONG DIVISION SUM WHICH I COULDN'T DO WHICH I FAILED 
SO THEN I WAS PUT INTO A CLASS A STREAM 
WHICH I'VE SINCE FOUND OUT WAS ONE OF THE BOTTOM STREAMS OF THE SCHOOL 
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE HORROR OF BEING STUCK HERE 
IN THE BOTTOM STREAM 
WITH KIDS WHO JUST TEASED ME ALL DAY ABOUT MY ACCENT 
SO IT WAS QUITE GRIM THINKING THIS IS IT 
OH ADVICE TO A NEW FIRST YEAR 
I WAS QUITE CONFUSED AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS GOING 
I WAS ON MY OWN BUT I QUICKLY MADE A LOT OF FRIENDS 
YEAH THAT WASN'T ME 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM IT'S REALLY ODD 
GOD YOUR MEMORY AFTER THIRTY THREE YEARS 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK DOWN HERE 
OH MY GOODNESS YES THIS 
WELL THIS IS THE ROOM THAT CHANGED IT ALL FOR ME 
BECAUSE OF COURSE DARLING IT'S THE THEATRE 
THIS IS WHERE I JOINED THE DRAMA GROUP 
HELLO DOON HI MR. MACKAY HELLO OR COLIN PLEASE 
OH I'M ALLOWED TO CALL YOU COLIN NOW AM I OH ABSOLUTELY 
IT'S LOVELY SEEING YOU GREAT TO SEE YOU 
WHEN MR. MACKAY GOT ME TO JOIN THE DRAMA GROUP 
I GOT CAST IN CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE 
AND I PLAYED A VERY BITCHY ENGLISH PRINCESS 
WHICH IMMEDIATELY SHOT ME TO FAME IN THE SCHOOL 
BECAUSE EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS SO FUNNY 
AND IT'S INTERESTING 
BECAUSE I'VE PLAYED A LOT OF POSH ENGLISH PEOPLE SINCE 
TIME NOW FOR BUSINESS WITH COLLATERLY SISTERS 
CHRIS CHRIS 
ON NOW TO THE MONEY MARKETS 
AND A QUICK LOOK AT THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCE ARSE 
AND THERE YOU CAN SEE THE U. S. AND JAPANESE CHEEKS 
STARTED OFF WITH A GAP OF TWENTY FOUR 
BUT INCREASED TRADING 
FORCED THE TWO TOGETHER 
TO FORM A UNIFIED ARSE AT AROUND LUNCHTIME 
WHICH HELD FOR THE REST OF THE DAY 
IN SUMMARY THEN OH NO CHRIS 
WE HAVE A PICTURE OF CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE I FOUND ONE YEAH OH MY GOODNESS 
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT 
ACTUALLY IT WAS QUITE A SMALL PART BUT BECAUSE OF YOUR ACCENT YEAH 
IT WORKED WITH THE AUDIENCE YES IT DID 
AND AS YOU CAN SEE THAT FIXED EXPRESSION YES 
THAT MET US IN EVERY CLASSROOM THAT WE WALKED IN 
THAT IN ITSELF CREATED QUITE A STIR SLIGHTLY SUPERIOR PERHAPS 
IT CREATED QUITE A STIR ROUND THE THEATRE 
BUT THAT'S WHAT I REMEMBER OF YOU THERE 
AND EVEN IN REHEARSALS AND BEHIND THE SCENES YOU WERE ALWAYS 
YOU CAME OUT OF YOURSELF YEAH YOU CAME OUT OF YOURSELF IN THE PLAY 
MY WHAT DESOLATE COUNTRYSIDE IT'S DEVILISHLY HOT ISN'T IT 
WHERE THE DICKENS ARE WE 
RIGHT HERE'S THE MAP IF THIS IS FRANCE WE MUST BE HERE 
I HEAR THE FRENCHMEN ARE FRIGHTFUL CADS 
WE MUSTN'T DROP OUR GUARD FOR AN INSTANT OH NO 
WE'VE FOLLOWED YOU OVER THE YEARS WHICH HAS BEEN LOVELY 
YOU'VE BEEN TALKED ABOUT AT CERTAIN TIMES 
ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING VERY GOOD 
WELL YOU'LL HAVE TO COME AND SEE MY WEST END SHOW RIGHT 
IS THAT WHERE YOU ARE JUST NOW I'M ON IN LONDON'S WEST END RIGHT 
SO FROM THE THEATRE FROM MADRAS COLLEGE TO MY FIRST WEST END SHOW 
I'VE MADE IT ALL BECAUSE OF YOU THAT'S NICE OF YOU 
ALL BECAUSE OF YOU 
THIS IS WHERE EVERYTHING STARTED TO GET A LOT BETTER FOR ME 
DOING PLAYS AND NOT BEING BULLIED 
YES THANK YOU 
THANK YOU 
THANK YOU THANK YOU 
SCOTLAND'S COMEDY MAP IS FULL OF SURPRISES 
SOME HIGHLY IMPROBABLE 
IT WAS HERE IN MUMBAI THAT INDIA'S FILM MOGULS 
CAME UP WITH BOLLYWOOD'S MOST SUCCESSFUL ROMANTIC COMEDY 
KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI 
COMPLETE WITH A THREE MINUTE DREAM SEQUENCE FILMED HERE 
AND HERE 
AND HERE 
AND HERE 
WELL GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME 
AH 
AH AH AH AH AH AH AHHHHH 
ALL OUR FILMS ARE MUSICALS 
THAT GIVES US THE FLEXIBILITY 
TO SHOOT A SONG 
WHEREVER WE WANT TO 
SOME OF THE SONGS ARE ACTUALLY SORT OF DREAM SEQUENCES 
AND IT ALSO ALLOWS THE AUDIENCE THE MASSES BACK HOME 
TO SEE SOMETHING NEW WHICH MAYBE THEY'RE NOT EXPOSED TO OTHERWISE 
MANY MOVIES HAVE ENJOYED THE SCOTS' LANDSCAPE 
BUT NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE HAD THE BOLLYWOOD MEGA RUPEES TO SPLASH ABOUT 
WE ARE HEADING NOW TO ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL SCOTTISH CASTLE DOUNE CASTLE 
WHERE A FILM WAS SHOT OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO 
FOR A FEE THAT COULDN'T EVEN MATCH THE BHAJI BUDGETS OF MUMBAI 
AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
MEANWHILE LET'S TURN OUR ATTENTION TO A NEW FILM 
INTRIGUINGLY ENTITLED MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL 
WHICH IS AN E. M. I. WOMBAT FILM AND WHICH I'M RELIABLY ASSURED 
TRACES THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY 
FROM SAINT THOMAS AQUINAS TO BOB MONKHOUSE 
CAMELOT 
THE REMARKABLE THING WITH THIS FILM WAS 
THAT NORMALLY FILMS COST TWO OR THREE MILLION 
THIS ONE WAS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND TO CREATE A MEDIEVAL WORLD 
THAT IS WHAT IS EXTRAORDINARY 
THE HOLY GRAIL IS ACTUALLY A QUEST FILM 
IN ORDER TO CREATE THAT QUEST 
THEY WANTED TO SHOOT IN LOADS OF DIFFERENT CASTLES 
OBVIOUSLY WE DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO THAT 
AND SO DOUNE CASTLE SAVED US 
TIS A GOOD CASTLE ACTUALLY 
THE FRENCH TAUNTING CASTLE IS HERE 
I FART IN YOUR GENERAL DIRECTION 
CASTLE ANTHRAX WHERE THE GIRLS ARE IS HERE 
THE CASTLE ANTHRAX 
YES IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD NAME IS IT 
AND OF COURSE THE SONG CAMELOT IT ALL TAKES PLACE HERE 
WE'RE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE 
WE DANCE WHENE'ER WE'RE ABLE 
WE DO ROUTINES AND CHORUS SCENES 
WITH FOOTWORK IMPECCABLE 
WE DINE WELL HERE IN CAMELOT 
WE EAT HAM AND JAM AND SPAM A LOT 
THIS WAS THE CAMELOT HALL THE HALL WHERE THEY SANG THE SONG 
AND THEY ALL PLACED THEMSELVES UP HERE TO SING AND CLEE 
AND YOU SEE TERRY GILLIAM PULLING DOWN A CURTAIN HERE 
WE'RE OPERA MAD IN CAMELOT 
WE SING FROM THE DIAPHRAGM A LO O. O. O. O. OT 
SOME OF THE SCENES THAT I WAS INVOLVED IN WERE FILMED HERE 
WHEN THEY ATTACKED THE BATTLEMENTS AND THE KNIGHTS RAN UP 
AND STARTED HACKING AWAY AT THE CASTLE WALLS WITH THEIR SWORDS 
IN THE NAME OF THE LORD WE DEMAND ENTRANCE TO THIS SACRED CASTLE 
IN THE NAME OF GOD AND THE GLORY OF OUR 
WAIT 
THAT SETTLES IT 
AND THIS IS CASTLE ANTHRAX 
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING SO WE PUT A VERY WIDE ANGLE LENS 
GOT DOWN THERE AND SHOWED PUT CANDLES UP ON THOSE LEDGES 
MIDGET CRAPPER YES OH ZOOT 
PREPARE A BED FOR OUR GUEST OH THANK YOU THANK YOU 
MIKE'S BED WAS IN THIS FIREPLACE 
AND THEN IT COMES THROUGH THE CURTAINS AND THERE'S ALL THE GIRLS BATHING 
AND HERE IN CASTLE ANTHRAX WE HAVE BUT ONE PUNISHMENT 
FOR SETTING LIGHT TO THE GRAIL SHAPED BEACON 
YOU MUST TIE HER DOWN ON A BED AND SPANK HER 
A SPANKING A SPANKING 
YOU MUST SPANK HER WELL AND AFTER YOU HAVE SPANKED HER 
YOU MAY DEAL WITH HER AS YOU LIKE AND THEN 
SPANK ME AND ME AND ME 
AND ME YES YOU MUST GIVE US ALL A GOOD SPANKING 
A SPANKING A SPANKING A SPANKING 
AND AFTER THE SPANKING THE ORAL SEX 
BUT WE HAD A GOOD EVENING THAT NIGHT WITH THE LADIES AND THE CREW 
SHOULDN'T PUT THAT IN 
IT WAS JUST OVER HERE THAT THE TROJAN RABBIT MADE ITS ENTRANCE 
BECAUSE IT WAS SO HEAVY THEY HAD THE LAND ROVER INSIDE WITH A CABLE 
PULLING IT UP TO TRY AND GET IT ANYWHERE NEAR THE CASTLE 
COS IT WEIGHED SO MUCH IT WAS A HUGE THING 
RUN AWAY 
RUN AWAY RUN AWAY RUN AWAY 
RUN AWAAAAAY 
RUN AWAY 
THIS IS WHERE THE PRINCE AND HIS FATHER ARE TALKING 
AND THIS IS THE WINDOW WHERE HE SAYS 
ONE DAY LAD ALL THIS WILL BE YOURS 
WHAT THE CURTAINS NO NOT THE CURTAINS LAD 
ALL THAT YOU CAN SEE 
STRETCHED OUT OVER THE HILLS AND VALLEYS OF THIS LAND 
THAT'LL BE YOUR KINGDOM LAD 
BUT MOTHER FATHER LAD FATHER 
BUT FATHER I DON'T WANT ANY OF THAT 
GET ON WITH IT YES GET ON WITH IT 
YEAH GET ON WITH IT 
WE HAD A BUDGET I MEAN A VERY LIMITED BUDGET 
WE HAD NO EXTRAS AND NO SERIOUS MONEY TO PAY EXTRAS 
SO WE ACTUALLY WENT TO THIS VILLAGE AND WE GOT LOCAL PEOPLE 
IF YOU WILL NOT ASSIST US VOLUNTARILY 
NI NO 
THIS IS KNITTED 
I USED TO KNIT WHAT THEY USED FOR CHAIN MAIL FOR CHAIN MAIL 
BUT IT WAS ALSO SPRAYED WITH SILVER 
NI NI NI 
WHO ARE YOU WE ARE THE KNIGHTS WHO SAY 
NI 
NO NOT THE KNIGHTS WHO SAY NI THE SAME 
MICHAEL PALIN'S TOP 
VERY BECOMING VERY BECOMING INDEED 
I ENJOYED MAKING THESE 
AND THIS IS THE HOOD 
GET ON WITH IT 
SO YOU COME TO THIS MARK THERE WHERE ZUKO IS 
YOU COULD GO EVEN FURTHER 
THE COST OF HORSES IS IMPOSSIBLE YOU HAVE TO HOUSE THE HORSES 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE RIDERS 
AND THE PYTHONS MOST OF THEM CAN'T RIDE 
ONE OF THEIR GREATEST SOLUTIONS TO ONE OF OUR BUDGETARY PROBLEMS 
WAS THE HORSES AND THEY CAME UP WITH A GREAT SOLUTION THE COCONUTS 
WOAH THERE 
THERE'S MIKE UP THERE AND WE HAVE THE FULL EXPLANATION 
OF WHY WE DON'T HAVE HORSES IN THE FILM 
WE HAVE RIDDEN THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE LAND 
IN SEARCH OF KNIGHTS WHO WILL JOIN ME IN MY COURT AT CAMELOT 
I MUST SPEAK WITH YOUR LORD AND MASTER 
WHAT RIDDEN ON A HORSE YES 
YOU'RE USING COCONUTS 
WHAT YOU'VE GOT TWO EMPTY HALVES OF COCONUT 
AND YOU'RE BANGING THEM TOGETHER 
THEY'RE GIVING COCONUTS OUT IN THIS CASTLE 
TO TOURISTS SO THAT THEY CAN WALK UP AND DOWN BANGING COCONUTS 
BUT THEN OF COURSE AFRICAN SWALLOWS ARE NON MIGRATORY 
OH YEAH SO THEY COULDN'T BRING A COCONUT BACK ANYWAY 
YOU JUST HAVE TO BANG COCONUTS TOGETHER AND EVERYBODY GOES HOLY GRAIL 
KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE SONG 
ON SECOND THOUGHTS LET'S NOT GO TO CAMELOT 
IF IT'S CAKE YOU'RE AFTER THEN GET A SLICE OF OUR NEXT DESTINATION 
DUNDEE 
RESTING ON THE RIVER TAY THERE ARE CORNERS OF IT 
THAT BEAR AN UNCANNY RESEMBLANCE TO MOSCOW 
WHICH IS WHY IT STOOD IN AS THE BODY DOUBLE FOR THE RUSSIAN CAPITAL 
IN ALAN BENNETT'S COMEDY AN ENGLISHMAN ABROAD 
PIROSKE PIROSKE 
I WANT YOU TO MEASURE ME FOR SOME SUITS FROM MY TAILOR 
I ONLY HAVE ONE SUIT THE ONE I CAME AWAY IN 
AND I'VE FALLEN DOWN A LOT SINCE THEN 
WON'T THE PEOPLE HERE GET YOU A SUIT 
OH YES BUT HAVE YOU SEEN THEM 
CLOTHES HAVE NEVER BEEN THE COMRADES' STRONG POINT 
JUST UP THE ROAD FROM DUNDEE CITY SQUARE 
IS A BUILDING THAT'S PRODUCED MORE WELL THUMBED PAGES AND CLOSELY EXAMINED STRIPS THAN PLAYBOY 
IT'S THE HOME OF D. C. THOMSON A COMIC EMPIRE 
HERE WE ARE IN PUBLISHING HEADQUARTERS 
OF D. C. THOMSON'S IN MEADOWSIDE IN THE CENTRE OF DUNDEE 
PROBABLY BEST KNOWN FOR PUBLISHING COMICS SUCH AS THE DANDY THE SPARKY 
THE BEAZER THE TOPPER 
AND JUST AHEAD OF US HERE WE HAVE THE BEANO ROOM 
RIGHT HERE 
THE BEANO STARTED IN JULY NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT 
AND MANY OF THE MOST FAMOUS CHARACTERS WERE SOMEWHAT GENTEEL 
MOST OF THE CHARACTERS HAD MAGICAL QUALITIES 
THEY HAD NOSES THAT EXPANDED THEY HAD HUGE FEET 
THEY HAD GIGANTIC HANDS 
THEY HAD MAGIC PATCHES ON THE SEAT OF THEIR PANTS 
THAT COULD TRANSPORT THEM INTO PLACES IN HISTORY 
AND THEN WHEN DENNIS EVOLVED 
HE BECAME A REAL NITTY GRITTY A REAL LIFE CHARACTER 
DENNIS COULD BE THE CHEEKY LITTLE BOY NEXT DOOR 
HERE'S A NEW PAL YOU'LL ENJOY 
HE'S THE WORLD'S WILDEST BOY 
MIAOW WHERE'S THAT CAT 
AT THIS TIME THE BEANO WAS MAINLY BLACK AND WHITE 
AND THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD EARN YOUR STRIPES REALLY OR THE COLOUR 
WAS THROUGH POPULARITY 
AND WE CAN SEE THAT DENNIS VERY QUICKLY BECAME POPULAR 
AND THIS IS THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF DENNIS IN RED AND BLACK 
DENNIS WAS A SOLO FIGURE IN HIS EARLY DAYS 
BUT SWIFTLY HE REQUIRED SOME SIDEKICKS 
I STARTED DOING THE SCRIPTS FOR DENNIS THE MENACE IN THE EARLY SIXTIES 
AND THE GUY WHO WAS DRAWING THE CHARACTER AT THAT TIME WAS DAVID LAW 
I CAME UP WITH AN IDEA 
WHERE DENNIS FOUND A STRAY DOG RUNNING ABOUT IN THE STREET 
AND I THOUGHT THIS'LL BE AN ABSOLUTE CRACKER 
BUT WHEN IT CAME TO PUTTING GNASHER DOWN ON PAPER 
DAVEY DREW A COMPLETE BLANK 
HE COULDN'T VISUALISE A FUNNY DOG AT ALL 
HE'S A WEE BIT MORE 
HE'S A WEE BIT SHYER THAN THE ORIGINAL GNASHER 
HERE HE IS 
IN ALL HIS SCRUFFY GLORY 
SO I HAD TO SIMPLIFY THE THING BY SUGGESTING 
THAT DAVEY DRAW DENNIS'S HAIRSTYLE 
WHICH HE'D DONE ON THOUSANDS OF OCCASIONS 
THIS WAS IT HERE 
THE HAIRSTYLE IN THE CORNER 
A LEG ON EACH END OF THE DOG AND TWO EYEBALLS 
THAT WAS THE VERY FIRST CREATION OF GNASHER 
THAT WAS ON AUGUST THIRTY FIRST NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT 
GNASHER BEING A MAD DOG HE COULD DO VIRTUALLY ANYTHING HE WANTED 
EVERY DENNIS GAG THAT I THOUGHT UP 
YOU COULD THEN HAVE A MORE OUTRAGEOUS VERSION 
APPLYING THE SAME GAG TO GNASHER SO IT DOUBLED THE FUN 
NO TRIP TO SCOTLAND WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT A HIGHLAND FLING 
UP TO THE CAIRNGORMS AMID SCOTLAND'S PREMIER PISTE 
YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO FIND A DOWNHILL RACER ON THESE SKI SLOPES 
THAN AN ACCOUNTANT 
LET ALONE AN ACCOUNTANT YEARNING TO BE A STAND UP COMIC 
SO HERE I AM FEBRUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY 
I'M TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD AND I FIND MYSELF UP HERE 
WORKING FOR THE CAIRNGORM CHAIRLIFT COMPANY AS THE ASSISTANT ACCOUNTANT 
THINK THIS SUIT LOOKS SMART YES 
REMINDS ME OF WHEN I WAS AN ACCOUNTANT 
AND AT THAT TIME I COULDN'T REALLY BEGIN TO EXPLAIN TO SOMEBODY 
THAT I WANTED TO BE A COMEDIAN YOU KNOW 
IT WAS ALIEN TO ME IT WAS ALIEN TO MY LIFESTYLE 
I BECAME AN ACCOUNTANT FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
I MISREAD A HEADLINE IN THE SCOTSMAN NEWSPAPER 
IT ACTUALLY SAID JOBS BLOW FOR SCOTTISH ACCOUNTANTS 
AILEEN WHO WAS MY GIRLFRIEND AT THAT TIME AND NOW MY WIFE 
HAD SAID SHE QUITE FANCIED A WEEKEND IN LONDON 
SHE'S THINKING YOU KNOW MUSEUMS GET TO THE SHOPS 
AND I'M THINKING RIGHT COMEDY STORE AND I KNEW 
THAT YOU COULD GET UP FROM THE FLOOR AND JUST DO FIVE MINUTES 
AND IF YOU WEREN'T BOOED OR GONGED OFF YOU KNOW 
THAT WAS YOUR NEW CAREER 
ANY COMIC PROFESSIONAL OR AMATEUR CAN STAND UP AND DO A TURN 
IF HE'S GOOD HE GETS FIVE MINUTES 
BUT IF THE AUDIENCE DON'T LIKE HIM HE GETS THE GONG 
WHEN WE GOT DOWN THERE I LOOKED AT THE STAGE THINKING ANY MINUTE NOW 
I'M GOING TO GET UP THERE AND GO AND DO SOME STAND UP 
BUT I BOTTLED IT I REALLY COMPLETELY BOTTLED IT 
BECAUSE IT WAS A REAL BOLT OF LIGHTNING 
A REALISATION THAT YOU HAD TO ACTUALLY HAVE SOME MATERIAL 
ERM AND I HAD NOTHING 
THE ACTS THAT WERE ON THAT NIGHT IN THE COMEDY STORE 
BY FAR AND AWAY 
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ACT THAT NIGHT FOR ME WAS ARNOLD BROWN 
WHO WALKED ON STAGE AND SAID 
HELLO I'M AN ACCOUNTANT FROM GLASGOW 
AND I THOUGHT NO HE'S TAKING THE PISS 
I WANTED TO ASK YOU TO HEAR A FEW OF MY PROBLEMS 
MY FIRST PROBLEM IS 
I'M AN ACCOUNTANT 
HE WAS ACTUALLY A BONA FIDE STAND UP AND NOT ONLY THAT 
HE WAS BRILLIANT AND NOT ONLY THAT 
BUT I KIND OF THOUGHT WELL MAYBE I CAN BREAK OUT FROM ACCOUNTANCY 
THE ONE HUNDRED METRES TO ME SOUNDS A BIT LIKE SEX 
TAKES ABOUT TEN SECONDS 
SOMEBODY COMES FIRST AND THE OTHER PERSON'S DISAPPOINTED 
SO THERE YOU ARE 
AND IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR COMEDY I MIGHT STILL HAVE BEEN HERE 
I'M GOING TO DO AN IMPRESSION NOW AND IT'S MY IMPRESSION OF A THREE MONTH OLD CHILD SNEEZING 
ACHOO 
FROM THE HIGHLANDS TO THE ISLANDS 
OVER THE SEA TO SKYE AND THEN SOME 
TO THE OUTER HEBRIDES 
THIS REMOTE LOCATION PROVIDED AN UNLIKELY SETTING FOR WHISKY GALORE 
AN EALING COMEDY INSPIRED BY THE REAL LIFE WRECKING OF A SHIP 
ON THE ROCKS OF CALVEY JUST OFF THE ISLE OF ERISKAY 
NORTHWEST OF SCOTLAND ON THE BROAD EXPANSE OF THE ATLANTIC 
LIE THE LOVELY ISLANDS OF THE OUTER HEBRIDES 
SMALL SCATTERED PATCHES OF SAND AND ROCK RISING OUT OF THE OCEAN 
WHISKY GALORE IS BASED ON TRUE EVENTS THAT HAPPENED IN THE WATERS OUT HERE 
A SHIP THAT HAD LEFT LIVERPOOL 
IT'S HERE THE S. S. POLITICIAN 
DUE TO BAD WEATHER IT TURNED WEST BETWEEN ERISKAY AND UIST 
AND RAN AGROUND 
WE MUST LOOK OUT WE DON'T GET TOO NEAR THE ISLANDS 
I'M NOT GOING TO PUT MY SHIP ON THE SGEIR DUBH 
I TELL YOU WE'RE NOWHERE NEAR ANY ISLAND 
THE S. S. POLITICIAN WAS WRECKED OFF THE END OF ERISKAY ON A LITTLE ISLAND CALLED CALVEY 
IT WAS APPROXIMATELY ON THIS SIDE 
ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE ISLAND OF CALVEY 
BETWEEN CALVEY AND SOUTH UIST 
AHOY 
AHOY 
CAN YOU TAKE US INTO HARBOUR 
I'LL SHOW YOU THE WAY 
WHAT WAS YOUR CARGO 
FIFTY THOUSAND CASES OF WHISKY 
AT THE TIME THE ISLANDS 
ON THE WEST COAST LIFE WAS 
TO SAY THE LEAST WAS EXTREMELY GRIM 
IT WAS SUBSISTENCE LIVING 
FIFTY THOUSAND CASES OF WHISKY 
IT LAID THERE OVERNIGHT 
BUT BEFORE PEOPLE OF THE CUSTOMS CAME FROM INVERNESS TO THE ISLANDS 
THE SHIP WAS RELIEVED OF ITS CARGO BY LOCAL ISLANDERS 
IT WAS LIKE TRYING TO CLIMB THE SIDE OF A HOUSE TO GET ON TO THE ROOF 
LITERALLY STRAIGHT UP ABOVE YOU A BIG SLAB OF STEEL 
AND YOU EITHER HAD TO GO UP THE ANCHOR CHAIN 
OR UP ONE OF THE ROPES THAT WERE DANGLING OVER THE SIDE 
PLUS YOU'RE DOING THIS IN THE DARK 
COME ON 
HURRY UP THERE COME ON 
OH WELL IT WAS SO SLIPPERY 
THE ROPES THE HANDS AND THE FEET 
SO SLIPPERY 
FULL OF OIL OIL AND 
SEAWATER VERY VERY SLIPPERY 
GEORGE BIFFER 
THE YEAR THAT THE POLITICIAN WAS WRECKED 
THERE WAS NOTHING GOT DONE IN ERISKAY AND KILBRIDE 
BECAUSE THEY HAD A PARTY TIME 
THIS IS ONE OF THE BOTTLES OFF THE S. S. POLITICIAN 
IT'S SPEY ROYAL WHISKY QUALITY WHISKY OF COURSE 
WHEN THE CUSTOMS GOT TO KNOW ABOUT IT 
PEOPLE STARTED HIDING THINGS 
PEOPLE STARTED TO PANIC BECAUSE IF THEY HAD BROUGHT AN AMOUNT HOME 
THEY HAD TO GET RID OF IT OUT OF THE HOUSE 
THERE'S A LITTLE STREAM OR A BURN RUNNING DOWN HERE 
THEY USED TO MAYBE DIG DOWN ABOUT THREE OR FOUR FEET 
AND PACK IT IN THERE 
AND IN THE DRAIN AS WELL THERE 
UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF PEOPLE COULDN'T REMEMBER 
WHERE THEY HAD LEFT IT 
AND SO TO THIS DAY I SUPPOSE THERE'S STILL A FEW BOTTLES AROUND 
I JOINED THE DIVERS TO DISCOVER THE SHIP'S INNERMOST SECRETS 
WHICH HAVE REMAINED A MYSTERY FOR FORTY SIX YEARS 
WHEN WE GOT ONTO THE SITE 
WE RECOVERED ROUGHLY A COUPLE OF DOZEN BOTTLES 
THEIR PAINSTAKING WORK WAS REWARDED WHEN ONE OF THE FROGMEN UNCOVERED 
TWO BOTTLES OF WARTIME WHISKY ONE OF THEM A MINIATURE 
A FRIEND OF MINE SUGGESTED THAT WE SELL THEM THROUGH CHRISTIE'S 
AT THEIR WHISKY AUCTION IN EDINBURGH 
OLD BOTTLES CAME UP AND THEY STARTED OFF AT A RESERVE PRICE OF OVER FIFTY 
AND JUST KEPT MOUNTING AND KEPT MOUNTING UP UNTIL THEY HIT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY 
THERE WAS THIS LOUD DRUNKEN CHEER FROM THE BACK FROM ALL THESE DIVERS 
WE WERE ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED WITH WHAT WE GOT 
IT'S LIKE YOU'VE WON THE POOLS BUT YOU DIDN'T EVEN BUY THE TICKET 
SO WE'VE GONE ABOUT AS FAR AS WE CAN GO IN SCOTLAND 
NOW BACK TO THE MAINLAND 
PASSING LARGS BIRTHPLACE OF STELLA STREET'S JOHN SESSIONS 
AND THE SURPRISINGLY NAMED QUEENZIEBURN 
HOMETOWN OF JANETTE TOUGH 
WHO'S BETTER KNOWN AS WEE JIMMY KRANKIE 
BUT BEFORE WE TAKE OUR FANDABIDOZI LEAVE OF SCOTLAND 
WE PAUSE IN THE FISHING PORT OF MUSSELBURGH 
HOME TO THE FIRST LADY OF SCOTTISH STAND UP RHONA CAMERON 
O. K. THIS IS WHERE I WAS BROUGHT UP 
NUMBER FORTY EIGHT 
COME STRAIGHT UP TO MY TEENAGE BEDROOM 
RIGHT UP THE STAIRS 
ORIGINAL CARPETS 
AH LOOK 
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT EH 
THERE I AM WITH MY STILL UNKEMPT 
UNMANAGEABLE STRANGE TEXTURED HAIR THAT I STRUGGLE WITH TODAY 
WE ALWAYS HAVE A BIG GET TOGETHER WHEN I GO BACK WITH ALL THE FAMILY 
WE HAVE A BIG MEAL IN HONOUR OF ME 
IT'S THE SAME THINGS ON THE MENU EVERY TIME 
GUILT RESENTMENT ANGER 
I WAS A SWIMMING CHAMPION OF SORTS 
AND ONCE A BREAST STROKER ALWAYS A BREAST STROKER THAT'S WHAT I SAY 
PEOPLE ARE STILL WEIRD ABOUT LESBIANS EVEN DOWN TO 
YOU KNOW YOU CHECK INTO A HOTEL 
WHAT ARE THEY WORRIED TWO WOMEN WILL DO TOGETHER IN A ROOM 
TIDY UP TOO MUCH 
I WAS IN LOVE WITH A TEACHER AND YOU KNOW I MEMORISED HER NUMBER PLATES 
LOOK THIS IS WHERE I'D STAND WITH MY BINOCULARS 
AND WATCH MY TEACHER DRIVE PAST AFTER SCHOOL SO I'D RACE HOME 
AND GET UPSTAIRS LIKE FIVE MINUTES AFTER SCHOOL AND GO 
THAT'S ALSO WHY I DO THIS JOB TO BE POPULAR 
WHEN I WAS A KID I WAS SO OBSESSED WITH IT I THOUGHT 
IF ONLY I COULD SAVE A SMALL CHILD FROM DROWNING 
ALTHOUGH BEING VERY SMALL HERE WAS LOVELY 
THERE WAS A MIDDLE PERIOD OF YOU KNOW ROUND ADOLESCENCE 
JUST BEFORE THAT ABOUT ELEVEN RIGHT THROUGH TO SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WHEN I LEFT 
IT WAS UNBEARABLE BECAUSE YOU KNOW 
IT'S JUST A LOT OF THICK KIND OF REDNECK SMALL TOWN PEOPLE HERE 
NEVERTHELESS I COULD SEE THE HEADLINES IN THE MUSSELBURGH NEWS 
UNPOPULAR LOCAL GIRL SUDDENLY BECOMES VERY POPULAR 
WE WERE WRONG SAY THE BASTARD PEOPLE OF MUSSELBURGH 
AS SOMEBODY VERY PROFOUNDLY SAID AT MY SCHOOL REUNION RECENTLY 
IT WASN'T THAT YOU WERE GAY IT WAS THAT YOU WERE GAY IN A SMALL TOWN 
AND I GOT BLAMED FOR LOTS OF REALLY WEIRD THINGS RIGHT WHEN I WAS A KID 
I TOLD MY MUM I WAS A LESBIAN 
AND ONE OF THE STRANGEST THINGS EVER I GOT BLAMED FOR WAS THE DEATH OF OUR DOG 
THE FAMILY DOG 
SHE SAID THE SHOCK KILLED IT 
YOU KNOW WHAT THERE'S ONE PLACE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP 
THAT I ABSOLUTELY LOVED WHICH WAS THE GIRL GUIDES 
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT FOR ME 
BEING IN AN ALL GIRL ENVIRONMENT THAT REALLY FREED ME UP 
EVERY FRIDAY IT WAS SO EXCITING 
TO COME DOWN TO THE SEVENTH MUSSELBURGH GUIDES 
WHERE I WAS LEADER AND OF COURSE HAD MANY BADGES 
MAY HOWARD
