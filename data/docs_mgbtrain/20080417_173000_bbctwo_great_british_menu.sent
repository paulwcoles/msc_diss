THE FIGHT GOES ON ON GREAT BRITISH MENU 
FOURTEEN OF THE COUNTRY'S TOP CHEFS ARE BATTLING FOR THE CHANCE TO PROVE 
THAT BRITAIN CAN PRODUCE THE FINEST CUTTING EDGE COOKING 
THE WINNERS WILL SERVE UP A BANQUET IN THE RESTAURANT AT THE SUMMIT OF THE GHERKIN IN CENTRAL LONDON 
THE COOKING WILL HAVE TO BE SUPERB BECAUSE HOSTING WILL BE OUR CULINARY TRAILBLAZER HESTON BLUMENTHAL 
AND HIS GUEST LIST WILL INCLUDE LEADING CHEFS AND GOURMETS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
WRESTLING FOR POSITION IN THIS WEEK'S HEAT TO REPRESENT THE NORTH IN OUR FINAL 
ARE ANTHONY FLINN AND NIGEL HAWORTH 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME TO WIN I'D BE VERY DISAPPOINTED IF I DON'T 
I'M IN IT TO WIN IT IF I WASN'T I WOULDN'T BE HERE 
NIGEL HAWORTH AND ANTHONY FLINN HAVE HUGELY CONTRASTING STYLES 
BUT THEY BOTH BELIEVE THEIR FOOD SHOULD BE SEEN AS MODERN BRITISH 
IT'S DAY FOUR OF THE NORTHERN HEAT AND EACH CHEF IS REFINING A FOUR COURSE MENU 
WHICH WILL BE PRESENTED TO OUR JUDGES TOMORROW 
THEY WILL SHOW NO MERCY 
NOTHING LESS THAN THE BEST IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BRITISH COOKING WILL MAKE IT TO HESTON'S GOURMET BANQUET IN JUNE 
THEY'LL CHOOSE WHETHER ANTHONY OR NIGEL REPRESENTS THE NORTH IN THE FINAL 
AS JUDGEMENT DAY LOOMS THEY'RE DEFINITELY FEELING THE HEAT IN THE KITCHEN 
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ANTHONY HE'LL BE SWEATING TODAY 
FOR THEIR FISH COURSE 
FOR YESTERDAY'S MAIN COURSE 
SO WHAT SURPRISES WILL THEY COME UP WITH TODAY 
AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU ANOTHER FINE MORNING HOW'S THINGS 
GOOD LOOKING FORWARD TO TODAY 
YEAH YEAH IT SHOULD BE AN EXCITING ONE I THINK 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT IN YOUR BOX TODAY NOT AS COMPLICATED AS THE LAST THREE DAYS 
YOU'RE JOKING HONESTLY I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE COMPLICATED IN COMPARISON TO MINE I THINK TODAY 
CHOCOLATE THIRTY FIVE PER CENT THEY'RE THE HIGHEST MILK SOLIDS I COULD FIND 
AWESOME CHOCOLATE GREEN OLIVES GREEN OLIVES 
CREAM CHEESE THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY MY LOCAL FROM HUDDERSFIELD 
SO IT'S A CHEESECAKE IF YOU WANT TO BE THAT WAY IT IS A CHEESECAKE IT'S A PLAY ON A CHEESECAKE 
AND WITH ANTHONY'S STYLE YOU CAN BE SURE THAT IT WON'T LOOK LIKE A TYPICAL CHEESECAKE 
BUT OLIVES AND CHOCOLATE 
HE CLEARLY DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE HIS REPUTATION FOR CREATIVE INVENTION 
TO CALL IT AN OLIVE CHEESECAKE IS A BIT DEGRADING BUT IT'S ALONG THOSE LINES A CREAM CHEESE MOUSSE 
AND THE REASON WE'RE GOING WITH AN OLIVE ONE IS BECAUSE THEY'RE BUTTERY AND NOT AN AGGRESSIVE FLAVOUR 
SO THEY'RE GOING TO GO REALLY REALLY WELL WITH THIS DISH 
SO CAN NIGEL PULL ANOTHER LITTLE GEM OUT OF HIS BOX TO COMPETE WITH THAT 
I'M GOING TO DO A CURD CHEESE TART 
AND I'M GOING TO SERVE IT WITH REDCURRANTS AND A ROSE PETAL CREAM 
THE MAIN INGREDIENT IS AN ORGANIC CURD IT'S A LOVELY CHEESE 
WILL THIS DISH BE SUFFICIENTLY CUTTING EDGE FOR OUR JUDGES 
LET ALONG A DISH WORTHY OF THE BEST CHEFS IN THE WORLD 
THERE HAS TO BE A MODERN TWIST IN THERE SOMEWHERE 
LANCASHIRE TEA IT'S ACTUALLY OH IT'S FROM YORKSHIRE IS IT 
IT'S A YORKSHIRE TEA OH AYE I THOUGHT 
COS WE'RE REPRESENTING THE NORTH HAVE THEY NOT TOLD YOU THAT 
YEAH NOW I THOUGHT THE WARS OF THE ROSES ENDED IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN BUT APPARENTLY NOT 
AND DOESN'T TEA FROM HARROGATE MAKE IT SOUND EVEN MORE OLD FASHIONED UNLESS IT'S VERY SPECIAL 
THIS IS A ROSE PETAL TEA SO I MAKE AN INFUSION WITH THAT 
AND THEN INFUSE THE CURRANTS THAT GO INTO THE CURD TART 
AN INTERESTING TOUCH BUT WE STILL HAVEN'T GOT TO THE CUTTING EDGE BIT 
IT'S THE ENGLISH ROSE WATER GOT A BIT OF YOGURT AND THERE'S THE CURRANTS 
SO THERE'S NOTHING VERY UNUSUAL ABOUT HIS INGREDIENTS 
THE MODERN TWIST MUST COME IN THE METHOD 
I'M SABAYONING THE EGG YOLK AND SUGAR AND I'M GOING TO BEAT THE BUTTER AND SUGAR REALLY LIGHT 
AND THEN TRYING TO EMULSIFY THOSE TWO AND HOPEFULLY IT DOESN'T SPLIT 
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN A SPLIT TART IS THERE YEAH 
YOU'RE SO RIGHT ANTHONY BUT WHY HAS NIGEL CHOSEN SUCH A SIMPLE PUD 
THE CURD IS REALLY LOVELY AT THIS TIME OF YEAR 
IT'S VERY CREAMY 
SO I'M HOPING YOU KNOW THAT THOSE SORT OF CORE INGREDIENTS WILL SEE ME ALONG 
GOOD LUCK MATE GOOD LUCK YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT ON THIS ONE 
NOT MESSING AROUND AND GETTING THE FLAVOURS SHOULD BE THE WINNING FORMULA 
LUCKY IT'S CALLED THE GREAT BRITISH OLD SCHOOL MENU THEN 
ANTHONY OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T THINK MUCH OF HIS RIVAL'S CHOICE 
HE'S ALREADY LOOKING LIKE THE CAT THAT'S GOT THE CREAM BUT IS NIGEL BEING CLEVER BY PLAYING IT SAFE 
HIS DISH COULD CRUISE HOME IF ANTHONY COMES UNSTUCK WITH HIS INNOVATIVE DESSERT 
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT TO FIND OUT 
AT JUST TWENTY EIGHT ANTHONY IS ALREADY HEAD CHEF OF HIS OWN RESTAURANT BASED IN LEEDS IN YORKSHIRE 
THREE SALMON PLAICE WE'RE ON DUCK VEAL COD 
YEAH LET'S GO 
HE TRAINED AT HUDDERSFIELD TECHNICAL COLLEGE 
BUT WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT FERRAN ADRIA WHO RAN A RESTAURANT CALLED EL BULLI IN SPAIN HE HAD TO WORK FOR HIM 
IT WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT AUTOMATICALLY INSPIRED ME 
A MENU THAT WAS TWENTY FIVE THIRTY COURSES LONG WITH ALL KINDS OF WACKY LITTLE DIFFERENT BITS 
IT WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT WAS EXCITING THERE WAS NO BOUNDARIES THERE WAS NO PARTICULAR FORMAT 
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HESTON WAS JUST DEVELOPING ON IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS NEW TO THIS COUNTRY 
WHAT ANTHONY LEARNED IN SPAIN CONTINUES TO INFLUENCE HIS FOOD TO THIS DAY 
BUT IT'S NOT JUST HIS CUTTING EDGE STYLE THAT COULD HELP SECURE HIM A PLACE IN THE FINALS 
IT GETS US ALL OUT AND ABOUT DON'T IT TOGETHER YEAH IT DOES 
HIS FRIENDS GLEN AND CHRIS BELIEVE HIS COMPETITIVE NATURE WILL HELP HIM THROUGH TOO 
TONY'S GOT TO BE THE MOST COMPETITIVE ALWAYS WANTS TO WIN 
OH YEAH THAT'S RIGHT IN'T IT DON'T MEAN I'M GOING TO WIN 
YOUR BEGINNINGS WERE VERY SIMPLE AND NOW IT'S A LOT MORE TECHNICAL 
YOU CAN SHOW YOUR SKILLS COMING RIGHT THROUGH 
IT DOES CROSS YOUR MIND WHERE DOES HE COME UP WITH THESE IDEAS FROM I'D NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT 
NOBODY LIKES LOSING EVERYONE LIKES TO WIN 
ANTHONY TAKES A LOT MORE PRIDE IN WINNING THAN MOST PEOPLE 
THERE'S SOME FANTASTIC CHEFS IN THE COUNTRY DOING THIS KIND OF COOKING 
I'D LIKE THAT STYLE TO BE AT LEAST UP THERE 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN THE TWO CHEFS ARE GETTING UNDERWAY 
AND ANTHONY CAN'T RESIST TRYING NIGEL'S CURD CHEESE 
CAN I HAVE A TASTE YEAH HAVE A TRY IS IT WEIGHED OUT 
IT JUST TASTES LIKE A DAY OLD CURD DOESN'T IT BANG ON 
SO DID YOU JUST COME ROUND HERE AND SAY YOU LIKED MY CHEESE I LIKE YOUR CHEESE 
I DO LIKE YOUR CHEESE SORRY SORRY I DO LIKE YOUR CHEESE SORRY 
HE MAY LIKE THE CHEESE MORE THAN THE RECIPE BUT HE KNOWS NIGEL'S A FORMIDABLE COOK 
NIGEL HAWORTH IS A MICHELIN STARRED CHEF AND CO OWNER OF NORTHCOTE MANOR NEAR BLACKBURN 
I AM VERY AMBITIOUS I AM VERY COMPETITIVE 
I'M ALWAYS THINKING IS THERE A NEXT PROGRESSION ON WHAT I DO NOW 
SO I'VE ALWAYS SWORE TO ACTUALLY TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL 
I HOPE THEY LIKE IT MEDIUM RARE THAT'S HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET IT 
HE'S ALWAYS KEEN TO SEE WHAT SEASONAL PRODUCE HIS SUPPLIERS CAN COME UP WITH NIGEL 
HOW ARE YOU VERY WELL THANK YOU GOOD TO SEE YOU YOU TOO 
WHEN YOU'RE COOKING NATURALLY YOU COULDN'T CREATE THAT PRODUCT THE SAME IF IT WAS COMING OUT OF THE FREEZER 
JUST A HARE OFF WE GO THEN 
I THINK THE REGIONALITY SIDE OF WHAT I DO WHICH IS REALLY WHAT I DO IS A LIFETIME'S WORK 
I DON'T LOOK THAT OLD BUT IN FACT I'VE BEEN AT NORTHCOTE MANOR FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS NOW 
SERVICE 
I COOK MODERN BRITISH FOOD I THINK THIS COMPETITION IS ALL ABOUT THE REGIONALITY FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
SO IF THAT'S A FACT THEN I SHOULD WIN THIS COMPETITION 
BACK IN OUR KITCHEN ANTHONY'S UPPING THE ANTE 
WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO LOSE AGAINST ME NIGEL 
IT WOULD MEAN THAT YOU'D HAD A LOT OF LUCK 
A LOT OF LUCK IS IT I DON'T BELIEVE IN LUCK YOU MAKE YOUR OWN 
THE GLOVES ARE OFF AND NO MISTAKE THIS IS A PURE TEST OF SKILL AND NERVE BETWEEN TWO CHEFS 
WHO NOT ONLY HAVE DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT STYLES BUT ALSO QUESTION ONE ANOTHER'S 
SO HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE A CREATIVE RESTAURANT IS THAT USING MILLIONS OF INGREDIENTS AND COMPLICATED FOOD 
IF THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED 
NOT THE TYPE OF FOOD YOU'RE GOING TO GET IN A STANDARDISED RESTAURANT 
IS HE IMPLYING THAT HIS FOOD'S MORE CREATIVE THAN NIGEL'S 
AND WHAT'S ALL THAT ABOUT A STANDARDISED RESTAURANT 
SOUNDS A BIT PROVOCATIVE TO ME 
DO YOU NOT THINK PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT AND EVERY COOK HAS A DIFFERENT CREATIVE MARKET 
YEAH IT'S A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING WHAT I CLASS AS CREATIVE FOODS 
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT A LITTLE BIT WACKY OFF THE WALL 
IT IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU FEEL PASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT YOU DO 
AND THEN FOR PEOPLE NOT TO GET IT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE ARSED TO SLIGHTLY TO EXPAND THEIR MIND 
AND GIVE SOMETHING A GO IT IS FRUSTRATING EVERY RESTAURATEUR FACES THAT COURSE THEY DO 
THERE'S A FEW MORE KNOCKS IN IN THIS STYLE OF COOKING 
I SUPPOSE THERE ARE IF SOME PEOPLE CONSIDER THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS A LITTLE BIT OUT THERE 
NIGEL CERTAINLY ISN'T IT HE'S SIMPLY GRATING LEMON ZEST INTO HIS CURD CHEESE AND ADDING THE JUICE 
THIS WILL MARINADE FOR THIRTY MINUTES SO HE'S GOT TIME TO KEEP AN EYE ON ANTHONY'S DESSERT 
HE'S BLITZING HIS GREEN OLIVES WITH CREAM CHEESE 
AND NIGEL CAN'T RESIST HAVING A TASTE 
I DO LOVE OLIVES LIKE A REAL OLIVE OIL TASTE TO THEM 
THEY'RE LOVELY AREN'T THEY SUPERB YEAH REALLY GOOD 
WHERE DO YOU GET THEM FROM 
I GET THEM FROM A LITTLE DELI IN 
LEEDS 
FINDING THE RIGHT SORT OF OLIVES FOR A DESSERT INVOLVED A BIT OF RESEARCH 
ANTHONY SOUGHT OUT THE ADVICE OF HIS OLD FRIEND CHEF CHIP DAMONE 
AT AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT IN HEADINGLEY NEAR LEEDS 
OLIVES ARE CURED IN BRINE GIVING THEM A SALTY FLAVOUR 
SO THEY'VE TRADITIONALLY BEEN USED IN EVERYTHING FROM PIZZAS TO SALADS 
SO WHICH OLIVES COULD POSSIBLY BE SUITABLE FOR A DESSERT 
FROM THE PUGLIA REGION IN THE HEEL OF ITALY WE'VE GOT THESE BELLA DI CERIGNOLA 
THESE BEAUTIFUL LARGE TABLE OLIVES A LOT MORE SOLID A LOT FIRMER 
MM TO ME THEY TASTE LIKE BUTTERED NEW POTATOES 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BUTTERED JERSEY ROYALS THEY'RE ALMOST AS BIG AS JERSEY ROYALS 
BUT WOULD ANTHONY WANT A NEW POTATO TASTE IN HIS DESSERT HMM MAYBE NOT 
THESE ARE FROM THE CAMPAGNA NAPLES REGION GAETA 
THE SMALLER ONES HAVE A MORE PRONOUNCED TASTE THAN THE BIGGER ONES 
THEN YOU CAN SEE THESE ON THE TURN SO THEY'VE GONE FROM GREEN 
THEY'RE NOT QUITE JET BLACK 
THEY'RE QUITE WINEY 
MUCH MORE PRONOUNCED TASTE FAR TOO STRONG I THINK 
O. K. SO WE'VE GOT THESE TONDO DI SPAGNA ANYTHING BETWEEN TWO MONTHS 
AND TWO YEARS THEY'RE KEPT IN BRINE ERM TO FLAVOUR THEM 
THE REASON WHY I THINK THEY'RE GONNA WORK SO WELL IS THAT CREAMINESS IT'S JUST LIKE A SOLID OLIVE OIL 
I THINK THEY'LL BE IDEAL 
SO HE DECIDED TO TEST THE TONDO DI SPAGNA OLIVES 
HE'D BROUGHT ALONG SOME KEY ELEMENTS FROM HIS DESSERT 
CREAM CHEESE WHITE CHOCOLATE AND CALAMANZI LIME FOAM 
DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING IF YOU WANT A REALLY MODERN TAKE ON BRITISH FOOD 
I REMEMBER ENJOYING LEMON MERINGUE PIES WHEN I WAS YOUNG 
THIS TASTES LIKE A GROWN UP VERSION 
THIS IS MODERN BRITISH COOKING AND I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO DO WELL WITH THAT ONE MATEY PERFE CT 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN ANTHONY HAS BLENDED 
HIS GREEN OLIVES INTO A PASTE AND HAS ADDED CREAM CHEESE 
HE'S NOW PIPING THE MIXTURE INTO PLASTIC TUBES 
WHICH THEN GO INTO THE FREEZER 
NIGEL CAN'T RESIST COMING OVER FOR ANOTHER TASTE 
IT'S VERY AMBER CORDIAL IN A FUNNY SORT OF WAY 
REALLY RICH ISN'T IT 
YEAH THAT'S WHERE THE CALAMANZI LIME STARTS TO KICK IN 
AND ALL THE REST NOT VERY LEEDS 
I'D SAY IT WAS VERY LEEDS VERY MODERN VERY UP AND COMING 
I WONDER WHICH WAY THE JUDGES WILL SEE LEEDS 
NIGEL'S MADE HIS PASTRY BASE AND BAKED IT BLIND FOR THIRTY MINUTES 
SO WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WERE IN THE PASTRY AT NORTHCOTE 
LAST WEEK PRACTISING 
YEAH YEAH NO ACTUALLY SEEING ME CURD TART 
NO I HAD TO GO IN THERE BECAUSE THE PASTRY CHEF WAS ON HOLIDAY LAST WEEK 
CAN YOU LOOK AT ME WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU 
OH WE'RE BUSY WE'RE NOT DOING OLD CLASSICAL TARTS SORRY 
SOME OF US AREN'T ROCKING OUT THE OLD CLASSICS CAN'T HEAR YOU 
OH IT'LL SAVE 
AND SO ALTHOUGH NIGEL WAS DOING IT LAST WEEK 
ANTHONY THINKS THAT HIS RIVAL MAY BE OUT OF TOUCH 
THAT COULD BE WHY HE'S SERVING WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN OLD CLASSIC 
WILL IT BE NIGEL'S UNDOING 
STILL TO COME ANTHONY'S KITCHEN GADGETS PLAY UP AGAIN 
FOR SOME REASON IT JUST STOPPED FOR SOME REASON IT'S GOT TOO HOT 
HE'S HAVING A BIT OF A NIGHTMARE 
AND THEY GET THE CHANCE TO TASTE AND COMMENT 
ON EACH OTHER'S FINAL COURSE 
ANTHONY'S RECIPE RELIES ON USING A SPECIALIST PIECE OF EQUIPMENT 
TO CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE OF HEATING 
AND THEN COOLING HIS CHOCOLATE TO GET THE TEXTURE RIGHT 
A PROCESS KNOWN AS TEMPERING 
GOOD TEMPERED CHOCOLATE IS YOU GET A CLEAN SNAP YOU CAN HANDLE IT WITHOUT IT MELTING IN YOUR FINGERS 
IT'S A NICE CLEAN SHINE ON THE PRODUCT IT'S A NICE CLEAN SNAP 
WELL HE WOULDN'T WANT ANY BAD TEMPERED CHOCOLATE WOULD HE 
IT'S TO FIRM THE TOPPING ON HIS DESSERT OF CREAM CHEESE 
AND GREEN OLIVE MOUSSE AND HE'S KEEPING THE OLIVE THEME GOING 
BY COMBINING YOGURT AND CALAMATA OLIVE OIL 
TO CREATE AN UNUSUAL ICE CREAM 
NIGEL'S FOLLOWING A VERY DIFFERENT STRATEGY WITH HIS ADAPTATION OF AN OLD CLASSIC 
CURD TART WITH ROSE PETAL CREAM AND REDCURRANTS 
HE'S FLAVOURING THE CURRANTS IN HIS TART WITH ROSE PETAL TEA 
AND ADDING ROSE WATER TO HIS MIXTURE OF CREAM AND YOGURT 
BUT ANTHONY REMAINS UNCONVINCED BY HIS RIVAL'S CHOICE OF DESSERT 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A CLASSIC TART ON THE GHERKIN MENU DO YOU THINK IT WOULD SIT WELL 
I THINK IF IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH YEAH 
NIGEL KNEW THAT IF THIS DISH WAS TO WIN HE WOULD NEED 
TO MAKE AN OUTSTANDING TART SO HE'D DONE HIS RESEARCH 
NOW CURD TART IS A FIRMLY ESTABLISHED TRADITION IN YORKSHIRE AND LANCASHIRE 
SO NIGEL FELT NO SHAME IN POPPING OVER TO A FAMOUS BAKERY 
BETTY'S IN HARROGATE 
TO FIND OUT HOW THEY MAKE THEIRS AND PICK UP A FEW TIPS 
BETTY'S MAKE OVER THREE HUNDRED VARIETIES OF CAKES CHOCOLATES AND BREADS 
AND ONE STORY HAS IT THAT IT WAS NAMED AFTER THE LATE QUEEN ELIZABETH THE QUEEN MOTHER 
BAKER PAUL DEANS HAS BEEN WORKING FOR BETTY'S FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS 
HERE WE'VE GOT CURD CHEESE WE'RE GONNA MIX THIS FOR EIGHT MINUTES 
WE'RE GONNA MIX IT TO A PASTE AND PUT A BIT OF NUTMEG IN JUST NUTMEG 
JUST NUTMEG ON ITS OWN YEAH NOW ORIGINALLY THAT'S A SECRET ONE 
ORIGINALLY THE OLD CURD WOULD'VE BEEN MADE WITH PERHAPS ROSE WATER IN AND THE REASON FOR THIS 
IS BECAUSE MANY MANY YEARS AGO SPICES WERE ONLY THE DOMAIN OF THE RICH PEOPLE RIGHT 
BUT ROSE WATER COULD BE HAD BY ANYBODY SO THEY USED 
PETALS EVERYWHERE SO THEY'D USE ROSE WATER TO FLAVOUR IT UP WITH 
INTERESTING YOU MENTION THAT PAUL COS I'VE READ UP ON THAT AND I WAS THINKING OF TRYING TO MAYBE INFUSE 
THE CURRANTS IN MY CURD TART WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PERFUME OF ROSE PETAL THAT COULD BE DONE ABSOLUTELY 
THE CURD IS ADDED TO THE BUTTER SUGAR AND EGG MIX 
THEN IT'S TIME FOR THE CURRANTS BANG THEM IN BANG THEM IN 
IT CAN ALL GO WRONG AT THIS POINT 
YOU'LL HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH IT NOW PAUL BECAUSE IF YOU DAMAGE A CURRANT 
I'M WATCHING YOU VERY CLOSELY 
HAVING STUDIED THEIR MIXTURE NIGEL WAS KEEN TO SEE HOW THE LANCASHIRE 
VERSION HE'D MADE COMPARED WITH THE YORKSHIRE ONE THEY HAD WAITING 
IF YOU'D LIKE TO COME THROUGH WE'VE GOT CURD PERFECTION ON THE TABLE FOR YOU TO HAVE A LOOK AT 
I'VE CUT THE CHEESE INTO A LITTLE BIT BIGGER CHUNKS AND MARINATED THEM IN LEMON JUICE AND LEMON ZEST 
I'VE TRIED TO SORT OF LIGHTEN THE WHOLE THING UP A LITTLE BIT AND GIVE IT A BIT OF A LANCASTRIAN FEEL 
THE LANCASHIRE BIT IS PARTICULAR COS IT'S ORGANIC CHEESE 
OH I SEE O. K. FROM LEVEN HALL IN CHIPPING 
YEAH EXCELLENT SO YOU KNOW IT'S A VERY SPECIAL CURD CHEESE 
IT'S VERY BUTTERY VERY RICH 
MM DO YOU THINK IT'S GOOD ENOUGH AND MODERN ENOUGH TO WIN AT THE GHERKIN 
YOU HAVEN'T TRIED OURS YET 
SO WHAT WOULD NIGEL THINK OF THE YORKSHIRE CURD TART 
I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND OURS A LITTLE BIT SWEETER THOUGH 
IT'S SWEETER AND IT'S A MORE PASTY TEXTURE ISN'T IT 
WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS A MODERN VERSION I DO ACTUALLY LIKE IT VERY MUCH 
I DO LIKE YOUR TEXTURE AND YOUR FLAVOURS 
I WON'T SAY THAT IT'S BETTER THAN OURS BECAUSE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU 
MATE WE DON'T WANNA START T'WAR OF ROSES ALL OVER AGAIN NO 
BACK IN THE GREAT BRITISH MENU KITCHEN NIGEL'S CHOSEN NOT TO MIX HIS CURRANTS IN THE CURD 
BUT TO LAY THEM IN WITH THE CUTE CURD AND SIMPLY POUR OVER THE EGG AND SUGAR MIXTURE 
SO THERE IS A REVOLUTIONARY TECHNIQUE INVOLVED 
ALL HE HAS TO DO NOW IS POP IT INTO THE OVEN FOR THIRTY MINUTES AND RELAX 
ANTHONY THOUGH CAN'T RELAX HE HASN'T HAD MUCH LUCK WITH GADGETS THIS WEEK 
AND THIS ONE WON'T TEMPER HIS CHOCOLATE PROPERLY 
FOR SOME REASON IT JUST STOPPED IT'S GOT TOO HOT WHAT DO THEY SAY 
IF YOU CAN'T STAND THE HEAT GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN AND THAT'S 
EXACTLY WHAT ANTHONY'S DOING WITH HIS MACHINE TO TRY TO COOL IT DOWN 
THE KITCHEN'S TOO HOT NOW TOO WARM THE KITCHEN'S TOO WARM 
SO IT'S KICKED IN ON THE SAFETY MODE SO IT'S NOT 
IT'S NOT TEMPERING 
IT'S GIVE UP THE GHOST IT'S TO HOT IN HERE SO CAN'T DO MY JOB IF IT'S TOO WARM 
SO I'VE COME OUT HERE TO COOL DOWN A BIT AND WE'LL SEE HOW WE GO IF NOT I'LL TEMPER IT BY HAND 
LOOKS LIKE HE'S HAVING A BIT OF A NIGHTMARE 
BUT IT STILL WON'T WORK AND ANTHONY'S HAVING TO SCOOP OUT THE CHOCOLATE 
AND REVERT TO AN OLD FASHIONED TECHNIQUE 
SO YOUR MACHINE'S BROKEN THEN ANTHONY 
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW ARE YOU GOING TO TEMPER IT BY HAND I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME 
NOW HE'S HAVING TO THINK ON HIS FEET HE'S MELTING THE CHOCOLATE 
AND TRYING TO CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE WITH ICE 
I NORMALLY WOULDN'T BRING WATER NEAR CHOCOLATE FOR THIS BUT 
ICE WHERE INTO THE CHOCOLATE NO UNDERNEATH I WAS GONNA SAY YOU WERE FRIGHTENING ME THEN 
ONE SLIP OF THE WATER WOULD RUIN ALL THIS CHOCOLATE 
HE'S WITHIN DEGREES OF DISASTER AND IT'S TOO LATE IN THE DAY TO START AGAIN 
DO YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY IMPRESSIVE THAT YOU HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE 
IT'S JUST AS WELL THOUGH IN'T IT THERE'S NOT MANY COOKS KNOW HOW TO TEMPER IS THERE 
WHITE CHOCOLATE'S A DEVIL AS WELL ISN'T IT ONE OF THE WORST 
WELL I DIDN'T KNOW THAT 
AND IT'S ALSO SURPRISING TO HEAR NIGEL COMPLIMENTING HIS RIVAL AFTER THEIR EARLIER SKIRMISHES 
I THINK ANTHONY'S GONE UP IN HIS ESTIMATION 
I'VE JUST HAD TO REVERT BACK TO A FEW CLASSIC METHODS WHICH I'M SURE HE'S CHUCKLING HIS ABOUT 
I'M CONCERNED YOU KNOW COS I NEEDED TO GET THIS DESSERT OUT 
WE'RE GETTING THERE WE'RE GETTING THERE DON'T YOU WORRY I'LL BE THERE ON TIME 
I KNOW YOU'LL BE THERE ON TIME I'LL BE THERE ON TIME THREE HOURS LATE 
HE'S ONLY JOKING THE CURD TART'S ONLY JUST FINISHED COOKING 
IT'S OUT THE OVEN IT'S DONE 
IT'S LOVELY AND GOLDEN IT JUST NEEDS TO SET UP NOW FOR TWENTY MINUTES OR SO 
I'M GLAD IT'S NOT ME FAFFING ABOUT LIKE THIS 
IF THIS HAPPENS TOMORROW HE'S GONNA HAVE BIG PROBLEMS 
I WOULDN'T WANT TO WIN BY DEFAULT AT ALL 
BUT WINNING'S WINNING 
ANTHONY'S FINALLY TEMPERED HIS CHOCOLATE 
AND IS SMOOTHING IT ONTO TRANSFERS 
AH SO YOU'VE GOT IT ON THE TRANSFERS NOW YEAH WE'RE ON 
WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE PAIN BARRIER OF ALL THE ISSUES WITH THE CHOCOLATE WE'VE GOT THIS TEMPERED 
YOU'RE GONNA BEAT ME BUT I AM ON NOW 
YOU'VE STILL GOT THAT ARROGANCE AND CONFIDENCE IT'S NOT ARROGANCE CONFIDENCE IT IS 
IS ANTHONY CREATING THE WINNING DESSERT 
NIGEL CERTAINLY THINKS HE'S TAKEN LONG ENOUGH PREPARING IT 
HOPE IT'S GONNA BE WORTH THE WAIT TONY HELLO 
HOPE IT'S GOING TO BE WORTH THE WAIT YEAH I TOLD YOU TO OFF 
YOU CAN'T RUSH PERFECTION TONY 
IS THAT WHAT THEY SAY MATE 
HE'S SLICING UP HIS CREAM CHEESE AND GREEN OLIVE MOUSSE AND NIGEL'S 
ADDING HIS SPECIALLY CHOSEN ROSE WATER TO HIS YOGURT AND CREAM 
IT'S TIME TO PLATE UP NIGEL'S COOL CALM AND COLLECTED 
AS HE SPOONS OUT HIS ROSE FLAVOURED CREAM 
PLACES THE CURD TART AND THEN SPRINKLES THE DISH WITH REDCURRANTS 
IS THIS SIMPLICITY AT ITS BEST WE'LL SEE 
COME ON TONY 
ANTHONY'S MOVING ONTO THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE 
HIS CHOCOLATE SHEETS ARE TOPPED WITH CREAM CHEESE AND GREEN OLIVE MOUSSE 
THEN ANOTHER CHOCOLATE SHEET THEN THE OLIVE OIL ICE CREAM AND THEN A PROBLEM 
IT'S FALLING OFF TONY IT COULDN'T HAPPEN AT A WORSE TIME COULD IT 
POOR ANTHONY BUT HE DOES TAKE A LOT OF RISKS 
HE FIXES IT FAST THOUGH AND FINISHES THE DISH 
WITH A DOLLOP OF CALAMANZI FOAM 
LET'S GO LET'S GO 
I'M HAVING THAT ONE 
SUPERB LET'S GO LET'S GO 
AT LONG LAST HERE THEY ARE 
NIGEL'S CURD TART WITH ROSE PETAL CREAM AND REDCURRANTS 
AND ANTHONY FINALLY GOT OUT HIS CREAM CHEESE AND GREEN OLIVE MOUSSE 
WITH YOGURT AND OLIVE OIL ICE CREAM 
IT'S TIME FOR THE TWO CHEFS TO TASTE THE DESSERTS IN PRIVATE 
SO THEY CAN SAY WHAT THEY REALLY THINK OF THEIR RIVAL'S COOKING 
NIGEL'S GOING FIRST SAMPLING ANTHONY'S DESSERT 
PRESENTATION'S INTERESTING I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY MODERN BRITISH ANTHONY AGREES 
I LIKE THE WAY THE DISH LOOKS 
I LIKE THE PRESENTATION I LIKE KIND OF EVERYTHING ABOUT IT 
SO THERE'S NO DISPUTE THAT IT LOOKS CUTTING EDGE BUT DOES THAT MIX OF OLIVES AND CHOCOLATE WORK 
THE OLIVE IS THERE I THINK YOU KNOW IF I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS OLIVE I'D STILL PROBABLY RECOGNISE THAT 
I THINK HIS CHOICE OF OLIVE IS VERY NICE AND IT DOES WORK WITH IT 
AND FUNNILY ENOUGH ANTHONY AGREES THAT WHITE CHOCOLATE AND SALTY OLIVES SING 
WHITE CHOCOLATE AND SALT THEY ALWAYS GO WELL TOGETHER IT'S A FANTASTIC COMBINATION 
BUT DOES NIGEL THINK THE CHOCOLATE HAS THE SNAP THAT ANTHONY WAS RAVING 
ABOUT EARLIER GIVEN THE PROBLEMS HE HAD TEMPERING IT 
HE'S RESCUED THE SITUATION HE'S ACTUALLY GOT THE CHOCOLATE TEMPERED 
THERE'S NOT THE SAME BITE I DON'T THINK THE TEMPER'S JUST EXACT SO IT'S NOT A CRUNCH 
I THINK THE CHOCOLATE'S MORE OF A MELT AND A SQUIDGINESS 
FOR CHOCOHOLICS ONLY THAT 
ANY SIMILAR RESERVATIONS FROM ANTHONY 
IT'S GOT IT ALL GOING IT'S GOT THE TEXTURE IT'S GOT THE FLAVOUR 
THERE'S A GREAT MODERN BRITISH DISH 
AND SOMETHING THAT SHOULD DEFINITELY GO TO THE GHERKIN I THINK 
ANTHONY'S HAPPY AND UNBEKNOWNST TO HIM 
HIS RIVAL'S QUITE IMPRESSED WITH IT TOO SO WHAT DO THEY BOTH MAKE OF NIGEL'S TART 
IT'S BRITISH 
YOU KNOW CURD TART VERY REGIONAL 
VERY BRITISH 
NOT HUGELY IMPRESSED THEN BUT HOW DOES IT TASTE IT'S PERFECT 
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT AT ALL REALLY GOOD 
YOGURT AND CREAM I MEAN YOU GET THIS FAINT TASTE OF THE 
THE ROSE AFTERWARDS FIRST IT'S YOGURT CREAM 
MASKS YOUR PALATE AND AS IT WARMS UP AND DISSOLVES OFF YOUR TONGUE 
YOU GET THE FRAGRANCE COME THROUGH IT'S QUITE CHEEKY CHEEKY WHAT DOES NIGEL THINK 
YEAH 
IT'S LOVELY I'M HAPPY WITH THE FLAVOURS OF THE DISH AND THE ACTUAL TASTE 
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN CHANGE ON THE PRESENTATION FOR TOMORROW I'M GONNA PUT MORE REDCURRANTS IN 
NIGEL'S PLAYING THIS VERY LOW KEY BUT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN HIS GAME ALL ALONG 
THE QUESTION REMAINS THOUGH IS IT MODERN ENOUGH FOR THE GHERKIN 
THIS IS WHAT I WOULD SERVE TO THE FRENCH THEY'D LOVE THIS 
I WOULDN'T BE COMFORTABLE PUTTING UP AGAINST HESTON AND ALL THE BIG BOYS 
WRONG CHOICE THEN BUT MAYBE NIGEL WASN'T BANKING ON THIS COURSE TO WIN HIM THE HEAT 
THAT WOULD BE A BOLD STRATEGY 
IF I WAS TO GET THROUGH PROBABLY I MAY LOOK AT THIS ONE AS ONE 
OF THE DISHES COS YOU CAN CHANGE ONE OF THE DISHES FOR THE FINAL 
SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THEM THAT I LOOK 
ONLY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW THAT IT'S MODERN ENOUGH 
THIS HEAT WILL GO TO THE WIRE 
THE MENUS THAT OUR COMPETING CHEFS HAVE COME UP WITH 
DEMONSTRATE TWO VERY DIFFERENT STYLES 
NIGEL'S STAYING REGIONAL AND GOING FOR FLAVOURS WHILE ANTHONY'S USING 
HIS IMAGINATIVE INSTINCTS TO CREATE VISUALS FEASTS 
BUT WHICH WILL TANTALISE THE TASTE BUDS OF OUR JUDGES EUGH 
ABSOLUTELY FOUL 
I JUST WANT SOME MORE THAT'S THE TROUBLE YOU ALWAYS DO MATTHEW 
SO HOW DO THE CHEFS FEEL BEFORE THE BIG DAY 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO MY FOOD BEING JUDGED I AM YES 
TOMORROW'S THE BIG ONE AND YEAH 
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP I'M GONNA PULL IT OUT THE BAG 
SO THERE'S EVERYTHING TO PLAY FOR TOMORROW ON GREAT BRITISH MENU
