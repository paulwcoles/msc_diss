DEEP IN SPACE LIES SUPERHERO SCHOOL 
ITS NEXT STUDENT IS BOLDLY GOING TO LEARN WHAT NO SUPERHERO HAS LEARNED BEFORE 
YES THIS IS THE STORY OF MATHS MAN 
HE LIKES TO KEEP IN SHAPE IT'S MATHS MAN 
MATHS MAN EXPECTED IN THREE POINT ONE SECONDS 
HI MATHS TEAM I'M MATHS MAN MATHEMATICAL SUPERHERO AT YOUR SERVICE 
ACTUALLY I'VE BEEN SUMMONED TO THIS LEARNING POD TO FIND OUT ABOUT SHAPES AND SPACE 
WELCOME MATHS MAN THIS IS VERA OUR FRIENDLY ON BOARD COMPUTER 
WHERE'S HIS WHOLENESS 
HERE I AM 
AND HERE ARE THE CRYSTALS FOR TODAY'S LESSON 
WHICH IS ALL ABOUT THREE DIMENSIONAL SHAPES 
NOW A THREE DIMENSIONAL OR THREE D. SHAPE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN HOLD LIKE THIS CUBOID 
THREE DIMENSIONAL SHAPES ARE ALL AROUND US MATHS MAN AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF EXAMPLES ON PLANET EARTH 
IN FACT PLANET EARTH COULD BE DESCRIBED AS A SPHERE 
AND THERE ARE PYRAMIDS 
AND THIS BUILDING COULD BE DESCRIBED AS TWO CUBOIDS WITH A PYRAMID ON TOP 
SO HOW DO WE REMEMBER ALL THESE THREE D. SHAPES 
OH EH THAT'S OVER TO VERA 
OH YES MATHS MAN DON'T FORGET I SHALL BE ASKING QUESTIONS 
SO VERA HOW WILL I REMEMBER THESE THREE D. SHAPES 
TRY MAKING SOME SHAPE MAKER EXPECTED IN THREE POINT ONE SECONDS 
WOW WHAT DOES IT DO 
IT MAKES THREE DIMENSIONAL SHAPES 
CHOOSE A SHAPE TO PUT ON THE FRONT 
THAT IS A SQUARE 
ADD SOME SHAPE STUFF FROM THE BUCKET 
AND PULL THE LEVER TO DISCOVER WHAT THREE D. SHAPES A SQUARE MAKES 
WOW 
THAT IS A CUBE EACH FLAT SURFACE OF THE CUBE IS A PERFECT SQUARE AND IS CALLED A FACE 
WHERE TWO FACES MEET YOU GET AN EDGE 
WHERE THREE EDGES MEET YOU GET A VERTEX 
IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE VERTEX WE CALL THEM VERTICES 
COOL I WANT TO MAKE A BIGGER ONE I'LL LEAVE THE SQUARE OPENING 
HERE WE GO MUCH MORE OF THIS STUFF 
BRILLIANT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WILL MAKE 
YES HEY HO 
THAT THREE D. SHAPE IS CALLED A CUBOID THIS CUBOID 
IS LIKE A LONG CUBE BUT ONLY TWO OF ITS FACES ARE SQUARES 
THE OTHER FOUR FACES ARE RECTANGLES 
NOW TRY WITH A TRIANGULAR FRONT 
A TRIANGLE MAKES A. WELL LET'S FIND OUT 
PUT THAT IN THERE 
PULL THE HANDLE 
AND YOU GET HEY HEY 
IT'S A TRIANGULAR PRISM OH CAN YOU DESCRIBE IT 
WELL YES HOW MANY FACES DOES IT HAVE 
EH ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE 
OH AND WHAT SHAPES ARE THEY 
AND THE REMAINING FACES ARE ALL RECTANGLES CORRECT 
A TRIANGULAR PRISM LIKE OTHER PRISMS HAS A SPECIAL QUALITY 
IF YOU CUT IT UP THIS TRIANGLE IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE NEXT ONE 
AND THAT TRIANGLE THE SAME AS THE NEXT AND SO ON 
IN OTHER WORDS A PRISM IS THE SAME SHAPE ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
HERE IS ANOTHER PRISM IT HAS HEXAGONAL FACES AT EITHER END SO WE CALL IT A. 
IF YOU CUT THIS UP IT IS THE SAME SHAPE ALL THE WAY THROUGH AS WELL 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I PUT A CIRCLE ON THE FRONT OF THE SHAPE MAKER 
LET'S FIND OUT 
RIGHT 
THERE YOU GO 
NOW THEN 
WOW 
HEY 
A CIRCULAR PRISM 
INCORRECT 
THE SHAPE IS LIKE A PRISM BUT IT IS CALLED A CYLINDER 
IT HAS TWO FLAT FACES AT EITHER END BOTH CIRCLES 
AND LIKE A PRISM IS THE SAME SHAPE ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
THIS IS FUN 
FUN MATHS MAN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LEARNING 
BUT I A. M. LEARNING LET'S FIND OUT SHALL WE YOU'LL NEED THESE BUT YOU WON'T NEED THAT 
I MIGHT NEED YOUR HELP MATHS TEAM O. K. 
HELLO TWO D. THREE D. GREETINGS MATHS TEAM 
THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT THREE D. SHAPES THEN ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS TIME STARTS NOW 
THIS IS AN HEXAGONAL PRISM HOW MANY FACES DOES IT HAVE 
O. K. THERE'S THE HEXAGONAL PRISM 
SO THERE ARE TWO HEXAGONAL FACES 
ONE EITHER END 
AND HOW MANY RECTANGULAR FACES 
AROUND THE SHAPE 
WELL THERE'S ONE TWO THREE 
FOUR FIVE SIX 
SO THAT'S EIGHT FACES ALL TOGETHER 
SO THE ANSWER IS 
YAHOO YOU REALLY COOL 
AN HEXAGONAL PRISM HAS EIGHT FACES 
O. K. CAN YOU NAME THE PARTS OF THIS TRIANGULAR PRISM 
DO WE CALL THIS A FACE OR A SURFACE 
I THINK IT'S A. 
CORRECT 
THIS PART SIDE OR EDGE 
EH OOH WHERE TWO FACES MEET 
A LLE D. A N. 
CORRECT THAT IS AN EDGE 
THIS PART VERTEX OR TIP 
M. M. M. IN ALL SHAPES 
WHERE TWO OR MORE EDGES MEET 
IT'S CALLED A. 
YAHOO 
SEE YOU NEXT TIME 
YES WE DID IT I THINK YOU'RE READY FOR PYRAMIDS NOW 
JUST LOOK AT IT MATHS MAN 
PYRAMIDS ARE THE MOST WONDERFUL SHAPES 
AND THERE ARE SUCH GLORIOUS EXAMPLES ON THE PLANET EARTH 
VERA WILL SHOW YOU I'M OFF TO DO THE SHOPPING 
SILENTLY 
O. K. VERA PYRAMIDS 
ON EARTH THERE IS A COUNTRY CALLED EGYPT WHERE YOU CAN SEE PYRAMIDS 
THESE WERE BUILT BY THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS 
WOW DO ALL PYRAMIDS LOOK LIKE THIS 
NO ALL PYRAMIDS COME TO A POINT BUT THERE ARE TWO MAIN TYPES 
THIS ONE LIKE THE ONE THE EGYPTIANS MADE IS A SQUARE BASED PYRAMID 
BECAUSE THE BOTTOM OR BASE IS A SQUARE SHAPE 
THE OTHER FOUR FACES ARE TRIANGULAR 
AND THEY ALL MEET AT THE VERTEX 
SO A SQUARE BASED PYRAMID HAS FIVE FACES ALL TOGETHER 
CORRECT 
THIS IS A TRIANGULAR BASED PYRAMID 
BECAUSE ITS BASE IS A TRIANGULAR SHAPE 
THE THREE OTHER FACES ARE TRIANGLES TOO 
SO IT HAS FOUR FACES ALL TOGETHER 
THIS TRIANGULAR BASED PYRAMID IS MADE UP OF EQUILATERAL TRIANGLES 
AND HAS A SPECIAL NAME 
TE T. R. A. HED RON GOT IT 
NOW CONCENTRATE MANY SUPERHEROES GET THIS BIT WRONG 
IF YOU SLICE THROUGH A PYRAMID FROM THE BASE UPWARDS THE SHAPE GETS GRADUALLY SMALLER 
OH YES EACH PIECE IS GETTING GRADUALLY SMALLER 
IMAGINE HAVING A PYRAMID MADE OUT OF CHOCOLATE 
I'D HATE TO GET THE TOP PIECE 
WHEN YOU SLICE THROUGH A PRISM YOU GET THE SAME SHAPE THROUGHOUT 
WHEN YOU SLICE THROUGH A PYRAMID THE SHAPE GETS GRADUALLY SMALLER THANKS I'LL REMEMBER THAT 
QUICK MATHS MAN EMERGENCY 
WHAT IS IT AN ALIEN INVASION WORSE 
IT'S THE WEEKLY SHOPPING THE HYPERSPACE MARKET IS A NIGHTMARE THIS TIME OF DAY 
COME ALONG MATHS MAN I BOUGHT SOME THINGS THAT MIGHT INTEREST YOU 
NOW EVERYDAY ITEMS ARE OFTEN PACKAGED THAT'S RIGHT IN THREE DIMENSIONAL SHAPES 
THESE MOON BEAMS FOR EXAMPLE COME IN A TIN CAN 
BUT ACTUALLY IT'S A CYLINDER 
THESE PLUTO POPS COME IN A BOX A BOX IS A CUBE 
THESE NEPTUNE NIBBLES WELL THEY COME IN A SQUARE BASED PYRAMID 
THESE SPACE FLAKES OH OH OH WAIT DON'T TELL ME THIS SHAPE IS A CUBOID 
AS THERE ARE FOUR RECTANGLES ROUND THE SIDE AND A SQUARE AT EITHER END 
OH MY GIDDY AUNT DO TRY AND CONCENTRATE MATHS MAN 
ONCE THE CONTENTS HAVE BEEN REMOVED THE SHAPE IS HOLLOW 
BUT IT CAN BE FLATTENED OUT TO MAKE WHAT WE CALL A NET 
THIS IS THE NET OF A CUBOID 
CAN ALL THREE DIMENSIONAL SHAPES BE FLATTENED OUT INTO NETS 
YES INDEED AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE CAN RECOGNISE WHICH NETS MAKE UP WHICH THREE D. SHAPES 
TO DEMONSTRATE WE'LL HAVE TO RELOCATE TO THE ROOF 
WHAT OUT THERE YES 
IN THE VAST EMPTINESS OF SPACE YES 
IN THE DARK YES 
COOL 
WOW 
AH THERE IS A CUBE 
AND EH HERE IS THE NET OF A CUBE 
THERE ARE SIX FACES ALL OF THEM SQUARE BUT THEY'VE BEEN FLATTENED OUT 
FOLD THEM TOGETHER TO MAKE THE CUBE 
HOW DO YOU TELL WHICH NETS MAKE WHICH THREE D. SHAPES 
WELL LOOK AT THE FLATTENED FACES 
IMAGINE WHAT SHAPE THEY WOULD MAKE IF THEY WERE FOLDED TOGETHER 
HERE IS A TRIANGULAR PRISM 
AND HERE IS THE NET OF A TRIANGULAR PRISM 
THERE ARE THREE RECTANGULAR FACES AND TWO TRIANGULAR FACES AT EITHER SIDE 
FOLD THEM TOGETHER AND YOU MAKE THE TRIANGULAR PRISM 
NOW LOOK AT THIS NET 
WHAT THREE D. SHAPE DOES IT MAKE 
WELL LET'S FIND OUT 
THERE ARE FOUR TRIANGULAR SHAPED FACES AND ONE SQUARE FACE 
IF THE TRIANGLES JOINED TOGETHER WHAT WILL IT MAKE 
A PYRAMID AND WHAT KIND OF PYRAMID WOULD IT BE 
A SQUARE BASED PYRAMID VERY IMPRESSIVE MATHS MAN YES YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT 
I THINK YOU'RE READY FOR YOUR FINAL CHALLENGE 
YOU'RE GOING TO DO A SPOT OF BUILDING BUT WHERE 
AT A WORKSHOP DOWN THERE ON PLANET EARTH 
UP UP AND 
UP UP AND AWAY 
THOUGHT I'D GROWN THEY'RE ONLY MODELS 
AH THE WORKSHOP 
HI THERE'S A LIST OF INSTRUCTIONS OVER THERE AND A PHOTO OF THE MODEL 
WOW 
YOU WANT ME TO BUILD THIS YEAH HEY HO WOW 
AH RIGHT FIRST SHAPE 
THE FIRST SHAPE YOU NEED IS A CUBOID 
WHICH OF THESE NETS WILL MAKE THE SHAPE YOU NEED 
CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT A CUBOID LOOKS LIKE 
LET'S SEE IF NET A WILL MAKE THE CUBOID 
NO 
LET'S SEE IF NET B. MAKES THE CUBOID 
YES THERE IS THE TRICK WHICH HELPS YOU KNOW WHICH NET MAKES THE CUBOID 
IF YOU'VE GOT FOUR EQUAL RECTANGLES IN A ROW 
AND A SQUARE ON OPPOSITE SIDES 
THEN THE NET WILL ALWAYS MAKE A CUBOID 
TA RA 
ONE CUBOID 
RIGHT ONWARDS AND UPWARDS 
SHAPE TWO 
THE NEXT SHAPE YOU NEED IS ANOTHER CUBOID RIGHT MATHS TEAM YOU WORK THIS ONE OUT FOLLOWING THE RULE 
IS IT A OR B. 
I HOPE YOU SAID B. 
FOUR EQUAL RECTANGLES IN A ROW AND A SQUARE ON OPPOSITE SIDES 
RIGHT THIRD SHAPE 
YOU NEED A TRIANGULAR PRISM 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A TRIANGULAR PRISM LOOKS LIKE 
I WONDER IF THE SAME TRICK WILL WORK HERE 
IF THE END FACES ARE ON OPPOSITE SIDES 
THEN NET B. SHOULD MAKE A TRIANGULAR PRISM 
JACKPOT 
OOH FINAL SHAPE THEN WE CAN START BUILDING I CAN'T WAIT TO USE MY NEW TOOLS 
FINALLY YOU NEED A SQUARE BASED PYRAMID 
CAN YOU VISUALISE A SQUARE BASED PYRAMID 
A PYRAMID HAS ONLY ONE BASE 
SO WHICH OF THESE NETS WILL MAKE A SQUARE BASED PYRAMID 
IT'S A 
THERE ARE NO MORE NETS SO WE CAN START BUILDING 
RIGHT 
OOH 
THE PRISM IT'LL GO 
THERE I THINK 
AND THE SQUARE BASED PYRAMID CAN GO 
THERE HEH HEH 
IT'S EASY THIS MODEL MAKING LARK 
WOW WOULD YOU LIKE A JOB HERE I'M SORRY I'VE GOT TO GET BACK I'VE GOT SO MUCH MATHS TO LEARN 
GOODBYE 
UP UP AND AWAY 
CONGRATULATIONS MATHS MAN 
YOU NOW KNOW ALL ABOUT THREE D. SHAPES ARE YOU READY 
ATTENTION 
AND I'VE SOMETHING FOR THE MATHS TEAM TOO A QUESTION 
WE KNOW THAT THE NET OF A CUBE LOOKS LIKE THIS 
BUT CAN YOU DRAW A DIFFERENT NET THAT WILL STILL MAKE A CUBE 
THINK ABOUT IT GOODBYE 
I DON'T KNOW WHY I LOVE YOU 
BUT I DO 
I DON'T KNOW WHY I CRY SO BUT I DO 
AND SINCE YOU'VE BEEN AWAY 
I CRY BOTH NIGHT AND DAY 
I DON'T KNOW WHY I LOVE YOU 
BUT I DO 
MY DAYS HAVE BEEN SO LONELY 
MY NIGHTS HAVE BEEN SO BLUE 
I DON'T KNOW HOW I STAND IT 
BUT I DO 
EACH NIGHT I SIT ALONE 
AND TELL MYSELF 
THAT I WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE 
I GUESS I'M WASTIN' TIME 
BUT I'VE GOT TO CLEAR MY MIND 
I DON'T KNOW WHY I LOVE YOU 
BUT I DO 
I DON'T KNOW WHY I LOVE YOU 
BUT I DO
