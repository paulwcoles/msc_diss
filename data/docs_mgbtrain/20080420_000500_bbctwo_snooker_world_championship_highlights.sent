WHEN YOU FIRST WIN IT YOU THINK 
THAT WAS THE HARD PART THE EASY 
PART WILL BE WINNING MORE BUT IT 
IS ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE 
THE HARD PART IS TRYING TO EMULATE 
THAT AND IT TOOK ME NINE YEARS TO 
TRY AND DO THAT 
IT IS JOHN HIGGINS 
WHO WINS THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT C. O. M. 
CHAMPIONSHIP HE WILL BE VERY PROUD 
OF HIS DAD INDEED FANTASTIC HELLO LAST YEAR JOHN HIGGINS HAD 
THE TALENT AND STAMINA TO STAY THE 
COURSE OVER SEVENTEEN DAYS TO WIN THE 
TITLE AND THE TROPHY FOR THE SECOND 
TIME IN HIS CAREER IN THIS EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT C. O. M. 
WORLD SNOOKER CHAMPIONSHIP HE 
FULFILLED HIS DREAM BUT TWELVE MONTHS 
ON TODAY HE WAS HANDED SOMETHING 
OF A NIGHTMARE DROP HE WAS UP 
AGAINST WELSHMAN MATTHEW STEVENS HE 
WAS ALWAYS SEEMS TO SAVE SOMETHING 
SPECIAL FOR THIS EVENT THIS 
MORNING IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THAT 
BECAUSE HIGGINS RACED AWAY INTO THE 
LEAD BACK CAME STEVENS THIS 
EVENING TAKING THE OPENING THREE 
EVENING TAKING THE OPENING THREE FRAMES WE LEFT IT ON B. B. C. TWO 
EARLIER WITH HIGGINS EIGHT FIVE IN FRONT 
NOW IT IS STEVENS AT THE TABLE IN 
FRAME FOURTEEN TERRY GRIFFITHS AND 
DENNIS TAYLOR WERE WATCHING EVENTS 
HAS HE DROPPED ON THAT RED HE 
TRIED TO DROP ON IT AGAIN I THINK 
HE IS OUT OF POSITION 
PLAYED THE RIGHT SHOT IT IS A 
TOUGH POT AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN 
TAKE THOSE POT ON AND THE 
DISAPPOINTMENT OF LOSING POSITION 
ON THE PREVIOUS SHOT 
HE GOT INTO IT TOO MUCH AND CAN'T 
THE RED CANNONED THE RED THERE 
IS A GAP HERE FOR JOHN HE HAS COME 
AND THE RED IS HE UNLUCKY HE IS 
HE JUST CLIPPED ANOTHER RED HE WAS 
HOPING TO AVOID THAT JUST WATCH 
HOW THE WHITE CATCHES THAT RED 
WITHOUT THAT CANNON HE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN IN GOOD POSITION SURELY THE 
PINK DOESN'T GO HE HAS HAD A LOOK 
AT IT FROM BOTH ENDS WHAT BONUS THIS COULD BE IT IS IN 
HE PLAYED THAT WELL HE HAS A 
CHANCE TO POT THE BLUE BRING THE 
PINK AND BLACK INTO PLAY IF HE 
DOESN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET 
ON TO ANOTHER RED THE REDS LOOK A 
BIT TRICKY 
HE HAS JUST NUDGED THE RED THROUGH 
THE GAP 
THAT WAS SO DELICATE WASN'T IT 
TERRY THAT CANNON VERY LITTLE 
MARGIN TO WORK WITH 
HIGGINS SUPPORTERS WILL BE 
ENCOURAGED BY THE LONG RED HE 
POTTED TO START THIS BREAK OFF HE 
HAS NOT BEEN HITTING THE LONG ONES 
TOO WELL IN THIS SESSION YES THIS 
YES THIS IS THE ONE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT 
I THOUGHT HE HAD RUN COMPLETELY OUT 
OF POSITION WHEN HE CANNONED THE 
RED BUT IT WAS STILL A GOOD POT ON 
THE PINK 
YES BUT HE STRUCK IT SO 
WELL IF YOU LOSE POSITION YOU CAN 
PLAY SAFETY HE WAS A LITTLE BIT 
FORTUNATE TO GET ONTO THE PINK BUT 
BALL STRIKING IS SO IMPORTANT TO 
THESE PROFESSIONALS THEY KNOW WHEN 
THEY ARE HE TOOK HITTING IT WELL 
AND THAT GIVES THEM THE CONFIDENCE 
YES THAT FRAME BEFORE THE MID 
SESSION INTERVAL GAVE JOHN HIGGINS 
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE 
HE WON IT IN STYLE WITH A BREAK OF 
SEVENTY FIVE 
I THINK THE LITTLE TRIANGLE OF REDS 
ARE O. K. WHEN HE POTS THIS RED IT 
CLEARS THE PATH FOR THE OTHER TWO 
INTO THE CORNER 
HE SCORES WELL JOHN HIGGINS WHEN 
HE IS ON FORM HE IS DECEPTIVELY 
QUICK AROUND THE TABLE 
HE HAS JUST 
GOT TO BE A BIT CAREFUL THOSE TWO 
REDS ARE NOW AVAILABLE 
THERE IS THE AVERAGE SHOT TIME NINETEEN 
SECONDS FROM JOHN HIGGINS TWENTY EIGHT FROM 
MATTHEW 
BUT YOU ARE LOOKING AT A CLASS ACT 
HERE IN JOHN HIGGINS A MAN WHO GOT 
A WORLD CHAMPION AND WORLD NUMBER 
ONE IN SIX SEASONS THE CLOSEST TO 
THAT WAS MARK WILLIAMS WHO MANAGED 
IT IN SEVEN SEASONS 
YOU ARE ALSO 
TALKING ABOUT A PLAYER WHO LOST HIS 
FORM AND CAME BACK TO WIN THE WORLD 
TITLE LAST YEAR IN HIS OWN WAY 
THAT IS A BETTER ACHIEVEMENT IN 
THE NINETIES HE WAS PLAYING AT HIS BEST 
IT IS NOT ALWAYS THE FORM THAT WINS 
YOU THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP OF 
COURSE YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE SOME OF 
IT WHEN YOUR MIND IS STRONG YOU 
CAN GET THROUGH MATCHES THAT HE 
WOULD POSSIBLY NEWS IF YOUR MIND 
WAS NOT RIGHT THAT IS WHAT JOHN 
HIGGINS DID LAST YEAR THAT HE 
WOULD POSSIBLY NEWS 
JOHN'S FATHER IS A PIN THE PLAYERS 
LOUNGE WATCHING THIS WAS HAVING 
A CHAT WITH HIM AND HE WAS SAYING 
THAT THE FRAME 
BEFORE THE 
MID 
SESSION INTERVAL WAS THE KEY FRAME 
THE FRAME IS COMPLETELY SAFE NOW A 
CHANCE IF THE CANNON WORKS OUT 
THAT HE COULD MAKE CENTURY BREAK 
IT HASN'T THOUGH WELL I SAY IT 
HASN'T HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HIT IT 
THINLY ENOUGH WELL PLAYED AND PERFECTLY ON THE BLACK 
HE HAS MADE THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO CENTURIES IN HIS 
CAREER IN FACT I THINK THE YEAR HE 
WON THE TITLE IT WAS A RECORD HE 
HAD SOMETHING LIKE FOURTEEN CENTURIES 
STEPHEN HENDRY MIGHT HAVE MADE SIXTEEN 
I AM NOT QUITE SURE ON THAT BUT I 
KNOW JOHN DID HOLD THE RECORD FOR 
THE NUMBER OF CENTURIES AT THE 
CRUCIBLE 
THEY NOT ONLY WIN YOU THE CRUCIBLE FRAME BUT THEY ALSO GIVE YOU A LOT 
OF CONFIDENCE 
AS ALWAYS THE CROWD LOVES TO SEE A CENTURY ESPECIALLY HERE AT THE 
CENTURY ESPECIALLY HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE SHOWING ALL HIS CLASS 
HERE THE DEFENDING CHAMPION 
THE FRAME BEFORE THE MID SESSION 
INTERVAL A SEVENTY FIVE BREAK HE HAS COME 
INTERVAL A SEVENTY FIVE BREAK HE HAS COME AFTER THE INTERVAL AND CLINCH THIS 
FRAME HE NOW JUST NEEDS ONE FOR A 
PLACE IN THE NEXT ROUND 
THE FIRST 
CENTURY IN HIS CURRENT CAMPAIGN 
MATTHEW STEVENS HAS NEVER GONE OUT 
IN THE FIRST ROUND OF THIS 
CHAMPIONSHIP HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE 
BUT THAT NOBLE RECORD LOOKED IN 
DIRE JEOPARDY NEXT IT IS MATTHEW 
WHO IS TWENTY FOUR POINTS AHEAD IN THIS NEXT 
FRAME 
WATCHING MATTHEW'S FACE HE WAS NOT 
SURE IF HE COULD REACH THE BROWN 
HE HAD AN AWFUL FEELING 
AND ALL OF 
THE CROWD WERE SMILING BECAUSE THEY 
DIDN'T THINK HE COULD REACH 
THERE IS A POSSIBLE RED INTO THE 
CORNER POCKET ONE GOES TO THE 
RIGHT MIDDLE POCKET THAT WOULD BE 
A BETTER OR OPTION IT MUST DO 
THAT IS ONE OF MATTHEW'S MANNERISMS 
HE GOES TO LOOK AT THE ANGLE 
DOES THAT RED PASS THE PINK IF IT 
DOES WHAT A CHANCE FOR JOHN 
HIGGINS IT MUST BE TIGHT 
NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED THERE WAS 
THAT A HEAVY CONTACT OR DID HE 
JUST NOT CUE THROUGH THE BALL HE 
SORT OF DECELERATED A BIT ON IT A 
BIT LIKE A GOLF SWING WHEN YOU 
DECELERATE YOU DON'T GET ANY 
ACTION ON IT AT ALL IT IS ALL 
ABOUT THE FOLLOW THROUGH THAT IS 
THE SECRET WITH MOST BALL SPORT 
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I 
ALWAYS DECELERATE ON MY GOLF SWING 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING 
TO DO A BIT LIKE THE JOHN VIRGO 
CHIP IN ISN'T IT YOU GET THE 
FEELING HERE WITH JOHN HIGGINS THAT 
IF HE DOESN'T LOSE POSITION HE 
COULD BE WINNING THE FRAME AND THE 
MATCH HE HAS RECOVERED FROM THE 
BAD SPELL HE HAD EARLIER THIS 
EVENING NOW HE IS STRIKING THE 
BALL WITH AUTHORITY LOOKS MORE 
CONFIDENT 
HE HASN'T GOT HIMSELF IN CONFIDENT PRIME POSITION HE IS HAVING TO 
WORK HARD BUT SHOULD BE O. K. AFTER 
THIS ONE HIS ONLY CONCERN IS THE 
RED TO THE RIGHT OF THE BLACK AS WE 
LOOK AT IT 
IT LOOKS AS IF HE HAS LEFT THAT A 
BIT SHORT HE MAY HAVE TO PLAY FOR 
THE BLUE 
CLEVER STUFF BECAUSE WHEN HE 
REMOVES THIS RED HE IS CLEARING 
THE PATH FOR ANOTHER ONE INTO THE 
LEFT CORNER 
IF THE RED DOES NOT POT INTO THE 
MIDDLE POCKET THAT COULD HAVE 
SPOILED THINGS BECAUSE OF THE 
HEAVY CONTACT THE WHITE HAS NOT 
RUN THROUGH 
HE IS CHECKING THE SCOREBOARD HE 
WILL NEED THE TWO AWKWARD LEFT 
REDS ON THE LEFT CUSHION YES HE 
YES HE WILL NEED ONE OF THOSE TWO REDS 
BUT THIS REALLY IS THE SIGN OF A 
TRUE CLASS 
TO RESPOND LIKE 
TRUE CLASS PLAYER TO RESPOND LIKE THIS 
HE LOST THE FIRST THREE FRAMES OF 
THIS EVENING'S SESSION BUT HOW HE 
HAS RESPONDED BREAKS OF SEVENTY FIVE THAT 
MAGNIFICENT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY IN THE PREVIOUS 
FRAME AND NOW THIS 
LOOKS LIKE A GOOD ANGLE ON THE PINK 
TO DISLODGE ONE OF THOSE TWO REDS 
YES HE IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT HERE 
HE CAN GO DIRECTLY INTO THE REDS 
OR HE CAN GO OFF THE CUSHION 
PERFECTLY PLAYED 
A QUICK GLANCE AT THE SCOREBOARD 
HE KNOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT 
CANNON 
COULD HE POSSIBLY FINISHED THE 
MATCH BAKING TWO CENTURY BREAKS 
FINISH THE MATCH MAKING TWO CENTURY 
BREAKS 
HAD MATTHEY STEVENS BEEN PLAYING 
ANY OTHER PLAYER I AM SURE HE 
WOULD HAVE WON COMFORTABLY BUT UP 
AGAINST THE DEFENDING CHAMPION 
JOHN HIGGINS JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO 
STRONG BUT MATTHEW STEVENS IS 
HEADING BACK IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
HE SHOULD NEVER BE OUT OF THE TOP 
SIXTEEN BUT I AM SURE HE WILL BE BACK 
NEXT SEASON AND PLAY HIS WAY BACK 
INTO THE TOP ELITE SIXTEEN 
THIS HAS TO STAND JOHN HIGGINS IN 
GREAT STEAD FOR THIS YEAR'S WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP COMING THROUGH A 
TOUGH MATCH LIKE THIS AND COMING 
THROUGH IT IN STYLE 
WHAT A PERFORMANCE FROM JOHN 
HIGGINS A VERY ENTERTAINING MATCH 
IT IS THE SCOTSMAN WHO HAS DONE IT 
IN STYLE WITH TWO CENTURY BREAKS 
AND HE GOES THROUGH TO NEXT ROUND 
YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY TIMES YOU 
HAVE GOT TO TELL YOURSELF THAT 
YOU'RE NOT OVER THE WINNING LINE 
BUT SUBCONSCIOUSLY YOU COME OUT AND 
THERE IS NO ADRENALIN THERE 
MATTHEW IS WELL CAPABLE OF RUNNING 
OFF THREE OR FOUR FRAMES IN ROW 
MY MIND WAS WANDERING AND I WAS 
THINKING OF HIM COMING BACK INSTEAD 
OF JUST CLOSING THE MATCH OUT WHEN 
HE CAME BACK TO SEVEN TO FIVE HE HAD A CHANCE 
WITH THE REST BUT HE MISSED AND I 
MANAGE TO GET INTO GOOD BREAK IT 
WAS REMINISCENT OF LAST YEAR WITH 
MATTHEW SELBY WHEN HE CAME BACK AT 
ME I'M GOING TO RELAX AND ENJOY 
TONIGHT DO NOT PLAY AGAIN UNTIL 
THURSDAY NIGHT SO IT IS A BIT OF A 
BREAK L. WILL HAVE A GOOD FEW DAYS 
TO WATCH SOME SPORT 
THAT WAS THE 
ONLY MATCH TO BE COMPLETED TODAY 
OTHERS ARE AT THE HALFWAY MARK 
FORMER CRUCIBLE RUNNER UP NIGEL 
BOND IS IN TROUBLE AGAINST NEIL 
ROBERTSON STEPHEN LEE HAD PROBLEMS 
AGAINST JOE SWAIL WHOSE FAN CLUB 
WERE DELIGHTED TO SEE HIM GO SEVEN TO TWO IN 
FRONT PETER EBDON DID VERY WELL TO 
GRIND HIS WAY BACK INTO A DIFFICULT 
MATCH AGAINST JAMIE COPE IT 
FINISHED FIVE TO FOUR IN FAVOUR OF JAMIE 
COPE ALI CARTER AND BARRY HAWKINS 
ALSO SQUARED UP 
I KNOW BARRY 
REALLY WELL WE GREW UP TOGETHER 
AND PLAY TOGETHER IN TOURNAMENTS AS 
JUNIORS L. PHONE HIM UP FOR PRACTICE 
LAST TIME I MET ALI PRACTICE CARTER WAS IN THE U. K. THIS SEASON L. 
WON NINE TO EIGHT IT WAS AN AMAZING MATCH 
ALI STARTED REALLY WELL AND I WAS 
SIX TO TWO DOWN AFTER THE FIRST SESSION 
BUT I MANAGED TO WIN 
I'M NOT THE 
ONLY PLAYER TO HAVE LOST A MATCH 
WHERE I SHOULD HAVE WON BUT BUT IS 
IN THE PAST KNOW YOU CANNOT CHANGE 
THE PAST BUT HE CAN HELP CHANGE THE 
FUTURE 
HOPED IT WOULD BE AN FUTURE ATTACKING GAME ENTERTAINING WITH 
BIG BREAKS AS LONG AS I COME OUT 
ON TOP I DO NOT MIND HOW IT GOES 
YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR 
EVERYTHING I THINK THERE WILL BE 
SOME FRAME KILLED IN ONE HIT AND 
NOTHING WILL BE SOME SCRAPPY FRAMES 
HOPEFULLY IF BY KEN WIN SCRAPPY 
ONES AND THE WANT WITH ONE HIT WE WE LEFT THIS MATCH EARLY UP WITH A 
HAWKINS THREE TO ONE AHEAD CARTER TOOK THE 
FIFTH FRAME 
A GOOD POT BUT HE 
DID NOT MANAGED TO HOLD FOR BLACK 
QUITE INFURIATING A GREAT POT BUT 
THE CUE BALL GETTING LOST WAS THE 
WORRY 
HE HAS NOT QUITE COVERED ALL THE 
REDS UP 
IT IS ALWAYS ANNOYING WHEN THAT 
HAPPENS JUST CATCHING THE JAW ON 
THE MIDDLE POCKET 
CARTER HAS ENOUGH OPEN REDS TO 
CLINCH THE FRAME 
BARRY LOOKED SO GOOD IN THE FIRST 
THREE FRAMES PLAYING VERY SOLIDLY 
I DO NOT THINK SCRUBBING OUT FRAMES 
IS A STRONG OH FOUR ALI CARTER BUT IT 
IS WORKING FOR HIM AT THE MOMENT 
A STRONG POINT 
THAT RED HAS PUT HAWKINS CONCLUSIVE 
THE OUT OF THE FRAME 
CONCLUSIVELY 
THIS IS A GOOD RECOVERY BY CARTER 
WHO WAS THREE TO ZERO DOWN AND STRUGGLING HE 
ALMOST WENT FOUR TO ZERO DOWN BUT MANAGED TO 
WIN THE FRAME ON THE PINK AND HAS 
ONE TWO MORE TO LEVEL THE MATCH 
WHAT A RUN THIS IS PROVING TO BE 
FROM CARTER HE WENT ON TO RUN FIVE 
FRAMES ON THE TROT THIS IS THE NINTH 
AND FINAL FRAME OF THE SESSION 
WHEN YOU GO INTO THE PACK OF REDS 
LIKE THAT IF YOU NEVER KNOW QUITE 
WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO FINISH HE 
WAS TRYING TO PLAY AN ATTACKING 
SAFETY BUT THE RED WENT OVER THE 
POCKET A GOOD SHOT 
HE WILL HAVE TO DEVELOP A FEW REDS 
IF HE IS GOING TO KEEP THE BREAK 
GOING BUT A BIT TOO STRAIGHT THERE 
THERE WAS A SLIGHT ANGLE BUT THERE 
WERE ONLY ONE OR TWO REDS BUT HE 
COULD KEEP LAND ON THAT HE COULD 
LAND ON ONCE AGAIN VIRTUALLY STRAIGHT 
HE COULD ONLY TAKE THE FIVE EXTRA 
POINTS AND PLAYED THE SAFETY 
OVER THREE AND ONE HALF HOURS FOR EIGHT 
COMPLETED FRAMES IS SLOWED BY 
MODERN STANDARDS 
BUT IT IS JUST ONE OF THOSE 
SESSIONS WHERE THE BALLS OF NOT CON 
PARTICULARLY WELL HAVE NOT GONE 
PARTICULARLY WELL IT IS A GOOD COMPETITIVE BATTLE 
WE MUST GIVE CARTER CREDIT FOR 
BEING PREPARED TO PLAY IN A STYLE 
WHICH IS FOREIGN TO HIM 
HE OPENED UP WITH AN EXCELLENT POT 
BUT COULD HAVE FINISHED MUCH BETTER 
ON A COLOUR 
HE DID NOT RECEIVE IT TO THE FAR 
CORNER HE WAS NOT AT THAT ANGLE 
ABLE TO PLAY TOO MANY EASY RED 
TO AN EASY 
HAS NOT BEEN 
QUITE AS AMBITIOUS IN HIS CHOICE OF 
SHOTS SINCE HE WAS THREE TO ZERO DOWN AND IT 
IS A POLICY WHICH HAS SERVED HIM 
WELL BECAUSE HE HAS WON FIVE 
FRAMES IN SUCCESSION 
HE HAS CAUGHT THIS VERY THIN HE 
MEANT TO CATCH IT COULD BE CLOSED 
AND CAUGHT BALL BUT THERE IS SO 
MUCH PACE ON IT THAT THE CUE BALL 
HAS COME RIGHT UP AND DOWN 
THAT IS UCKY ONE MINUTE HE IS 
ON YELLOW AND THEN THE BRAIN IS IN 
THE WAY THEN THE BRONA IS IN THE 
WAY 
HE HAS FORCED CARTER TO PLAY BAULK 
CUSHION FIRST THERE IS A RED TO THE FAR CORNER 
HE DID NOT GET VERY CLOSE TO IT IT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HECTIC THE REFEREE 
HAS CLEANED THE RED 
HE MUST HAVE FOUND SOMETHING HERE 
BECAUSE THE RED TO THE TOP LEFT 
LOOKED THE SHOT TO PLAY AT FIRST 
IF HE TOOK A SIXTY THREE BEAT HERE HE WOULD 
BE THRILLED OVERNIGHT EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY THREE TO 
LEAD HERE 
I AM SURE CARTER CAME 
HERE FULL OF CONFIDENCE AND WAS 
EXPECTING TO PLAY WELL FROM THE OFF 
BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE THIRD 
FRAME THAT HE POTTED A BALL 
IT LOOKS PERFECT WITH TWO MORE 
OPEN REDS HE CAN CERTAINLY BUILD A 
LEAD I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT HE CAN 
CLOSED THE FRAME OUT FROM HERE BUT 
HE HAS AN HANDY LEAD BUILDING UP 
WE HAVE SEEN HARD MATCH PLATE 
SNOOKER IN THE FRAMES AFTER THE 
MID SESSION INTERVAL MATCH PLAY HE WANTED TO GET BLACK OR BLUE INTO PLAY BUT THIS IS AWKWARD NOW 
A GOOD DECISION MADE THERE TO PLAY 
THE BLACK RATHER THAN THE PINK 
AT THREE TO ONE YOU MENTIONED THAT TERRY 
GRIFFITHS MIGHT HAVE WORD AND IT 
APPEARS TO HAVE DONE THE TRICK I I THINK THE FIRST THING HE WOULD HAVE 
DONE WAS TO HIM DOWN BECAUSE HE 
WAS GETTING OVER ANXIOUS BARRY BARRY HAWKINS STARTED SO STRONGLY 
ALI CARTER KNEW THAT THAT WAS FRAME 
BALL SO NO HEROICS 
HAWKINS CONCEDES HAVING LED THREE ZERO 
AND EVERY CREDIT TO CARTER HE HAS 
WON THE REMAINING SIX FRAMES AND 
WON THEM IN STYLE 
THEY WILL BE BACK TO FINISH THINGS 
OFF LATER TODAY THAT IS JUST ABOUT 
IT FROM US FOR THE MOMENT SNOOKER 
EXTRA WILL BE ON IN FEW MOMENTS 
THEREAFTER WE WILL BE BACK LIVE AT 
TEN A M. ON THE INTERACTIVE CHANNEL ON 
B. B. C. TWO AT ONE P. M. WE WILL HAVE THE 
REMAINDERS OF THE ROBERTSON VERSUS 
BOND MATCH STEPHEN HENDRY WILL BE 
PLAYING MARK ALLEN NOW TO A 
GENTLEMAN WHO HAS WON THE TROPHY ON 
SIX OCCASIONS CAN YOU GUESS GOOD 
NIGHT
