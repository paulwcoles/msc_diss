THE ASPIRATIONS OF TODAY'S BRITISH TEENAGERS HAVE CHANGED HANG ON LET ME GET MY GIRLS OUT 
IN A RECENT SURVEY OF GIRLS AGED FIFTEEN TO NINETEEN ALMOST TWO THIRDS ADMITTED 
THAT GLAMOUR MODELLING IS THEIR DREAM JOB 
I JUST WANT THIS SO MUCH AND I JUSTDON'T WANT TO GO HOME 
BUT IT IS A CUT THROAT INDUSTRY 
IF WE WERE SELLING ARMPITS THAT WOULD BE THE SHOT 
AND ONLY A FEW MAKE IT TO THE TOP 
THEY WON'T START UNLESS THEIR HAIR AND MAKE UP IS ALL PERFECT 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTY YEARS GLAMOUR AGENCY SAMANTHA BOND MANAGEMENT 
OPENS ITS DOORS TO REVEAL THE TEARS 
THEY SAID I WAS SO GOOD WELL YOU ARE YOU ARE GOOD 
TANTRUMS YOU WERE IN THE SPORT WITH YOUR CLOTHES ON DON'T PUT ME DOWN COS I'VE DONE TOPLESS IN NUTS 
AND THE PRESSURES THEY SAID I WAS FAT BASICALLY 
THIS IS LIFE AS A GLAMOUR GIRL 
MODELLING IS NOT AS GLAMOROUS AS PEOPLE THINK IT IS 
THIS WEEK NEW MODEL KATIE HART POSES FOR HER FIRST PAGE THREE SHOOT 
SHE'S GOT A GREAT LITTLE BODY HASN'T SHE 
I'M AMY NEW GIRL AMY DIAMOND MEETS MODEL TURNED PHOTOGRAPHER LOUISE GLOVER 
YOU CAN SEE WHY SAM LIKES YOU NOT ONLY BLONDE HAIR YOU'VE GOT BIG BOOBIES 
AND AMANDA HARRINGTON IS A REAL HIT ON U. S. RADIO 
EVERYONE HAS LIKED ME SO FAR 
YOU WERE GREAT HOW GOOD IS SHE 
MIAMI IN AMERICA'S SUNSHINE STATE FLORIDA 
ONE OF THE MOST GLAMOROUS LOCATIONS IN THE U. S. A. 
FOR THE NEXT MONTH IT'S ALSO HOME FOR U. K. GLAMOUR MODEL 
AMANDA HARRINGTON WHO'S HERE TO LAUNCH HER TRANSATLANTIC CAREER WITH U. S. MODEL AGENT ROCK ANDERSON 
SHE HAS ALL OF THE COMPONENTS OF A VERY ATTRACTIVE COMMERCIAL COSMETIC FACE 
WHEN YOU PUT THAT ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT SHE HAS A SWIMSUIT BODY 
YOU HAVE THE MAKINGS OF A GOOD GLAMOUR MODEL 
INTERNATIONAL FAME AND FORTUNE ASIDE 
AMANDA HAS A VERY DEFINITE VIEW OF WHAT KIND OF MODEL SHE WANTS TO BE 
I DON'T THINK I'M GETTING ANY FURTHER IN MY CAREER BECAUSE I DON'T DO TOPLESS AND THAT 
I DON'T THINK I'M GETTING ANY FURTHER IN ENGLAND 
AS THE STORM CLOUDS GATHER AMANDA IS ON HER WAY TO MAKE UP RUNNING LATE FOR HER FIRST SHOOT 
IF YOU LOOK OUTSIDE 
IT'S RAINING 
TODAY'S PICTURES ARE FOR THE MAGAZINE AMERICAN CURVES ONE OF THE CONTINENT'S 
MAJOR GLAMOUR PUBLICATIONS WITH A CIRCULATION IN EXCESS OF A QUARTER OF A MILLION READERS 
THIS IS LIKE A REALLY BIG MAGAZINE OVER HERE 
FOR CURVY MODELS WHO AREN'T THIN LIKE ME 
A LOT RIDES ON THE QUALITY OF TODAY'S PHOTOS FOR THEM TO STAND A CHANCE OF MAKING THE MAGAZINE 
I'M GOING TO SHOOT IT ON THE BEACH 
BUT HE THINKS IT'S GOING TO BE FINE ON THE BEACH AND THERE IS ENOUGH SUN 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS LIKE 
HE MUST BE IN L. A. 
COS THERE'S NO SUN HERE WHERE I AM 
AMANDA BATTLES THE MIAMI TRAFFIC TO GET TO A SMALL STUDIO ACROSS TOWN IN TIME FOR A MAKE UP SESSION 
ISN'T THIS GREAT YOU WOKE UP IN SOUTH FLORIDA YOU'RE ADORABLE 
AND WHAT IS YOUR NAME AMANDA 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET A SHOOT OUT HERE TODAY 
YOU NEED TO DO IT INDOORS 
UNLESS YOU HAVE AN UMBRELLA 
THE SUN HAS GONE IN AND IT IS NOT VERY SUNNY FOR THE BEACH 
SO I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE GONNA BE DOING THE SHOOT 
BACK IN LONDON THE SUN IS OUT AND SO ARE THE HOPEFUL MODELS 
THE AGENCY IS ABOUT TO INTERVIEW A NEW ONE 
KATIE HART IS NINETEEN YEARS OLD AND LIVES NEAR WOLVERHAMPTON 
SHE'S SENT PICTURES IN TO SAM BEFORE 
OBVIOUSLY SAM BOND IS LIKE WOW SAM BOND 
THAT'S WHO YOU WANT TO BE WITH IF YOU'RE A MODEL 
SO I SENT THEM OFF AND GOT A REPLY BACK OVER EMAIL 
SORRY YOU HAVEN'T GOT THE RIGHT LOOK FOR US 
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR CAREER AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
LUCKILY FOR KATIE THE WORLD OF GLAMOUR IS FICKLE 
AND LOOKS THAT WERE OUT ONE WEEK CAN BE JUST WHAT THE INDUSTRY WANTS THE NEXT SO KATIE GETS A RECALL 
WHEN I GOT THE CALL THE OTHER DAY I WAS OVERWHELMED TO BE HONEST I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT 
WHENEVER SAM TAKES ON A NEW GIRL IT'S ESSENTIAL SHE KNOWS WHAT THEY'VE DONE BEFORE 
HAS PHIL SENT YOUR PICTURES TO THE STAR 
NO ARE YOU SURE 
NOT TO THE STAR THE DAILY SPORT I'VE DONE A COUPLE 
THAT'S A BIT OF A PROBLEM WE WERE THINKING WE WOULD TRY AND GET YOU INTO THE STAR 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY 
THEY HAVE A BIT OF A PROBLEM WITH GIRLS WHO'VE BEEN IN THE SPORT 
COMPETITION IN THE GLAMOUR INDUSTRY IS FIERCE 
AND IT'S NOT JUST BETWEEN THE MODELS BUT BETWEEN THE PUBLISHERS TOO 
NEWSPAPERS LIKE THE STAR DON'T REALLY WANT TO BOOK GIRLS THAT ARE APPEARING IN THE SPORT NOR DO THE SUN 
SO THEY HAVE POLICIES LIKE THAT WHERE 
THEY FEEL THEY WANT THEIR GIRLS TO BE SPECIAL 
I NEVER READ THE SPORT UNTIL I WAS IN IT DOES ANYBODY ACTUALLY READ IT 
OH MY GOD I WAS ABSOLUTELY MORTIFIED 
I THOUGHT PEOPLE JUST LOOKED AT IT 
I THINK THE PAPERS REALLY JUST PRODUCING ONE PICTURE A DAY OF 
A PAGE THREE GIRL ARE MAKING A CELEBRATION OF THAT GIRL 
AND THEN THE NEWSPAPERS THAT HAVE WALL TO WALL TOPLESS 
NUDE MODELS THEY'RE REPRESENTING THEM IN A GRATUITOUS MANNER 
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE KATIE'S MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE BY APPEARING IN THE SPORT 
THEN THERE'S HER PORTFOLIO 
THESE ARE MY FIRST EVER PICTURES 
DON'T LIKE THIS 
SOME OF THESE HEADS ARE JUST NOT STRONG ENOUGH 
NO THEY'RE NOT UGH 
IS THAT ONE ALL RIGHT NO 
OH MY GOD I KNOW 
I'VE TAKEN EVERYTHING OUT 
CAN I SUGGEST THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THESE CONTACT SHEETS IN THE BAG 
YOU DON'T NEED ALL THAT GOING ON 
IF THERE ARE PICTURES THAT YOU HATE TAKE THEM OUT 
THAT'S THE RULE OF THUMB THERE'S NO POINT IN EVER HAVING AN IMAGE IN YOUR BOOK THAT YOU DON'T LIKE 
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOUR CLIENT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO LIKE IT WHAT ARE WE LEFT WITH 
EH NOTHING NOTHING O. K. 
ALL RIGHT WELL 
IF KATIE WANTS TO WORK FOR THIS AGENCY IT LOOKS LIKE SHE NEEDS TO START FROM SCRATCH 
YOU NEED TO GET A WHOLE NEW BOOK BASICALLY 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE IN A POSITION TO PAY BECAUSE MOST PHOTOGRAPHERS DO CHARGE 
THAT NEW BOOK COULD COST HER ONE THOUSAND PLUS BUT HER SPOT IN THE SPORT MAY HAVE COST HER MORE 
WE'LL SEND JEANY YOUR PICTURES AT THE END OF THE WEEK 
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TELL HER BECAUSE IF THEY FIND OUT 
YOU'VE DONE THE SPORT AND WE HAVEN'T TOLD HER SHE WON'T BE HAPPY 
BUT WE'LL TELL HER AND SEE WHAT SHE SAYS 
AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN START LOOKING FOR THE STAR 
YEAH COOL 
O. K. 
WELL NICE TO MEET YOU 
NICE TO MEET YOU TOO KATIE 
THEY DEMOLISHED MY BOOK BUT THERE'S NO ONE I'D RATHER DEMOLISH MY BOOK THAN SAM BOND 
I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SLIGHT PROBLEM WITH THE FACT THAT SHE'S BEEN IN THE SPORT YEAH I DO TOO 
I THINK THAT AVENUE'S GONNA BE CLOSED TO HER 
THAT'S A DIFFICULT HURDLE TO OVERCOME 
WE SHOULD TRY ANYWAY 
YOU NEVER KNOW OH NO WE WILL 
THEY MIGHT JUST OVERLOOK IT 
WE'LL SEE 
TWO HUNDRED MILES NORTH AMY DIAMOND IS SORTING THROUGH HER WARDROBE 
MUM YEAH 
WILL YOU COME AND HELP ME PACK RIGHT 
SHE'S TRAVELLING TO LONDON FOR HER FIRST PROFESSIONAL PHOTO SESSION 
THE SHOOT'S AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK 
LAST WEEK ON SAM BOND'S INSTRUCTION AMY TOOK SOME TEST SNAPS AT HOME 
HANG ON LET ME GET THE GIRLS OUT 
SAM WAS IMPRESSED ENOUGH TO ARRANGE A PROPER STUDIO SHOOT 
FOR TODAY ALL AMY'S BEEN TOLD IS THAT SHE NEEDS A VARIETY OF OUTFITS TO WEAR 
SO ARE WE GOING THROUGH THE LIST YEAH 
JEANS 
I'VE GOT A BLACK SWIMMING COSTUME LIKE A PARIS HILTON SORT OF ONE 
I'M HOPING AT LEAST IN THE PICTURES I'LL LOOK RELAXED AND HAPPY AND NOT 
LOOK LIKE A SCARED RABBIT IN THE HEADLIGHTS ON SOME OF THE PICTURES 
BUT I AM REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT IT 
ARE YOU YEAH 
TWENTY YEAR OLD AMY LIVES WITH HER MUM AND DAD 
AND HAS NEVER MODELLED BEFORE 
SHE WAS DISCOVERED ON THE TUBE AND THE FAMILY'S ONLY JUST GETTING USED TO THE IDEA OF HER NEW JOB 
I THINK ME NAN WOULD LOVE THEM WOULDN'T SHE 
I DON'T THINK WE'LL SHOW ME DAD I THINK WE'LL JUST TELL HIM ABOUT THEM 
NO HE SAID HE DOESN'T THINK HE WANTS TO SEE THEM 
AMY'S DAD FRED IS A LONG DISTANCE LORRY DRIVER AND IS FAIRLY LAID BACK ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER'S CAREER 
IT IS A PROFESSION NOW IT'S PROFESSIONAL IT'S NOT LIKE 
THE OLD DAYS WHERE STRIPPING OFF WAS SOMETHING WE ALL FROWNED UPON 
NOWADAYS IT'S PROFESSIONAL 
YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE BACKING THEM UP 
IT'S A CAREER 
THAT'S NICE YEAH THAT'S LOVELY 
I THINK THAT'S WHY SO MANY TEENAGERS WANT TO BE A GLAMOUR MODEL THESE DAYS IS WHAT GOES WITH IT 
TO BE SEEN WITH SOMEONE A MOVIE STAR A FOOTBALLER THESE ARE THE 
SORT OF PEOPLE THAT SEEM TO HANG ABOUT WITH GLAMOUR MODELS 
THEY SEE THAT AND THEY THINK WOW I'D LOVE TO DO THAT 
RIGHT WHAT ELSE IS ON YOUR LIST 
TOPS 
AMY MIGHT BECOME PUBLIC PROPERTY IN THE PAPERS AND DAD FRED KNOWS 
HE'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE REACTION FROM HIS MATES 
WELL THE FIRST THING THEY SAY ANY CHANCE OF GETTING ME A DATE WITH YOUR DAUGHTER 
AND I SAY NO YOU'VE NO CHANCE 
IF SHE ENDED UP LIKE JORDAN NOT IN THE SENSE OF HAVING HER BOOBS BLOWN UP BUT SHE IS A 
MILLIONAIRE NOW IT'D BE A NICE WAY TO GO IF IT HAPPENED TO AMY 
IT'S JUST THE BEGINNING OF AMY'S CAREER 
THAT MILLIONAIRE LIFESTYLE SEEMS A MILLION MILES AWAY RIGHT NOW 
THERE WE GO 
RIGHT 
BYE MUM BYE DARLIN' LOVE YOU 
BYE BYE LOVEY HAVE A LOVELY TIME 
I WILL TAKE CARE O. K. BYE 
IN MIAMI AMANDA FINALLY MEETS UP WITH PHOTOGRAPHER JOHN 
HIYA I'M SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS MESSIN' ABOUT 
HE'S ONE OF THE TOP PHOTOGRAPHERS FOR GLAMOUR MAG AMERICAN CURVES 
I HAVEN'T GOT NO PICTURES LIKE THAT NO SO THIS WILL BE GOOD FOR YOU 
THIS SHOOT IS JUST A TEST BUT THE PHOTOS HAVE TO BE TAKEN TODAY 
FOR AMANDA TO BE IN WITH A CHANCE OF GETTING SEEN BY THE MAGAZINE EDITOR 
THERE'S ONLY TWO HOURS OF DAYLIGHT LEFT 
SO WE'RE GONNA SHOOT HERE 
IT'S NOT A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY DAY NOW 
DO YOU THINK THEY'LL STILL LOOK GOOD 
THEY'LL BE DIFFERENT IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT LOOK 
IT'LL BE NEAT BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WON'T SHOOT THIS TYPE OF THING 
OTHER PHOTOGRAPHERS WOULD HAVE SAID OH FORGET IT 
BUT JOHN ISN'T LIKE OTHER PHOTOGRAPHERS AND WHILE HE SETS UP 
AMANDA GETS READY FOR HER FIRST SHOTS 
CAN YOU LEAVE ME NOW PLEASE 
IT'S THE FIRST TIME MEETING AMANDA BUT I REALLY LIKE HER LOOK 
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE CAN BE FASHION OR GLAMOUR SO I'M EXCITED 
ALSO SHE HAS A REALLY NICE BODY 
THAT'S A BIG PLUS 
WORKING AGAINST THE CLOCK JOHN IS STILL TRYING NEW IDEAS 
I FOUND ONE OF THE TABLES I'M GONNA HAVE YOU STANDING ON A TABLE 
IT'S PAST NINE P. M. AND THE TEMPERATURE HAS PLUMMETED TO FIFTEEN DEGREES 
AMANDA'S BEEN ON THE BEACH ALL EVENING AND STILL HAS THREE COSTUME CHANGES LEFT 
YOU'VE GOTTA DO WHAT YOU'VE GOTTA DO HAVEN'T YOU I'LL HAVE TO GRIN AND BEAR IT I'VE DONE WORSE 
IT'S A LITTLE COOL OUT AND SHE'S BEING A REALLY GOOD SPORT 
SOMETIMES THE MODELS ARE CRYING I'M COLD I'M COLD I WANNA STOP 
BUT SHE'S DOING GOOD SHE'S EXCITED 
SHE WANTS TO KEEP GOING 
THIS IS NOTHING COMPARED TO SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE HAD TO DO 
MODELLING IS JUST NOT AS GLAMOROUS 
AS PEOPLE REALLY THINK IT IS 
I SHOT WITH ONE ENGLISH GIRL BEFORE 
NOW SHE'S MY SECOND SHE'S MY FIRST FROM LIVERPOOL 
AND I NEED A DICTIONARY TO UNDERSTAND HER 
BUT NOW IT'S KINDA NIPPY OUT I THINK WE'RE ALL HUNGRY SO THAT'S A WRAP FOR TODAY 
AWESOME I LOVE IT 
NEXT DAY IN LONDON AND THE AGENCY HAVE MANAGED TO GET THEIR NEWEST SIGNING KATIE TO TEST SHOOT 
FOR THE DAILY STAR WITH EX MODEL TURNED PHOTOGRAPHER JEANY SAVAGE 
I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS TO BE HONEST 
I HAVEN'T MET HER BEFORE SO IT'S MY FIRST TIME AND IT'S SOMEBODY SO BIG YOU'RE JUST A BIT STARSTRUCK ALMOST 
I'VE JUST HEARD A FEW HORROR STORIES 
LIKE GIRLS HAVE GONE IN AND SHE'S SAID YOUR TAN'S TOO ORANGE 
YOUR HAIR'S TOO LONG YOUR HAIR EXTENSIONS LOOK AWFUL YOUR NAILS LOOK AWFUL 
I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO GO IN THERE AND BE TORN TO PIECES LIKE MY PORTFOLIO 
JEANY IS ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S TOP PAGE THREE PHOTOGRAPHERS 
IN GENERAL SHE WOULDN'T ACCEPT ANY MODEL WHO'S WORKED FOR ONE PARTICULAR RIVAL TABLOID 
THEY DID TELL JEANY ABOUT THE FACT THAT I WAS IN THE SPORT 
SHE DOESN'T LIKE USUALLY USING GIRLS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE SPORT SO 
WE WERE A BIT DUBIOUS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT SHE WOULD SEE ME 
BUT SHE SAID YEAH 
SO YOU KNOW HERE I AM 
O. K. EVIE EVA 
JEANY RUNS A BUSY STUDIO AND IS SHOOTING FIVE GIRLS FOR THE STAR TODAY 
ONE OF THE MODELS IS NINETEEN YEAR OLD KITTY LEA WHO'S ALSO ON SAM'S BOOKS 
NO FILMING TODAY 
KITTY LEFT SCHOOL AT SEVENTEEN TO PURSUE MODELLING FULL TIME AND HAS BEEN 
WORKING IN THE INDUSTRY FOR FIVE MONTHS HER CAREER IS ON THE UP 
SHE'S ALREADY BECOME A STAR PAGE THREE REGULAR 
THERE'S NOT THAT MANY GIRLS WHO GET OFFERED TO BE ON PAGE THREE SO OBVIOUSLY I'M THE CHOSEN ONE 
AFTER JUST FIVE MONTHS IN THE BUSINESS KITTY HAS WORDS OF WARNING FOR ASPIRING GLAMOUR MODELS 
I WOULDN'T ADVISE MANY GIRLS 
TO GET INTO THIS LINE OF WORK UNLESS THEY WANNA BE DISAPPOINTED 
IT'S SO COMPETITIVE LOTS OF GIRLS AND ALL THE MAGAZINES AND THE 
PAPERS AND EVERYTHING AREN'T THIS GREAT PERFECT IMAGE THAT YOU SEE 
I'VE SEEN THEM ALL IN REAL LIFE 
I'VE SEEN THEIR FLAWS AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL THE SAME 
NOBODY IS PERFECT SO 
WITH AN AIRBRUSH ANYONE CAN BE PERFECT I SUPPOSE 
OH THAT'S NICE 
THAT'S NICE 
EVEN THOUGH THE INDUSTRY IS FIERCELY COMPETITIVE THERE ARE GIRLS LIKE 
KATIE HART QUEUING ROUND THE BLOCK FOR THIS TYPE OF WORK 
SHE'S GOT A GREAT LITTLE BODY IN'T SHE THIS ONE 
JUST LIKE MINE DARLING USED TO BE 
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS BODY OF HERS SHE'S GOT A GREAT BOD 
THE SHOOT HAS GONE WELL 
AND LUCKILY FOR KATIE 
IT SEEMS HER BLIP IN THE SPORT HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED FOR NOW 
THERE'S BEEN NO MENTION OF THE SPORT OR ANYTHING SO THANK GOD 
I'M JUST GOING TO KEEP THAT SHTUM 
I THINK MY ULTIMATE GOAL WOULD BE I'VE DONE PLAYBOY U. K. 
IT WOULD JUST BE PLAYBOY U. S. NOW 
AN AVERAGE WORKING MODEL MAY GET ONE DAY'S PAID SHOOT A WEEK 
TODAY THOUGH AMY DIAMOND IS HEADED TO AN UNPAID TEST SHOOT IN EAST LONDON 
TODAY'S LIKE THE FIRST STEP INTO LIKE ME GLAMOUR MODELLING CAREER 
SO I JUST REALLY WANT IT TO GO WELL AND TO GET ON WITH EVERYONE AND FOR 
THEM TO THINK THAT I'M LIKE A HARD WORKING PERSON JUST FOR THEM TO HAVE A GOOD OPINION OF ME REALLY 
AMY IS A YOUNG PRETENDER DISCOVERED ONLY THREE WEEKS AGO 
SHOOTING HER TODAY IS EXPERIENCED MODEL LOUISE GLOVER 
I NEED WIND BECAUSE I'M DOING DANCING SHOTS AND I WANT SOME MOVEMENT IN THE PICTURE 
FOR AMY MAKING THIS CAREER MOVE INTO GLAMOUR HAS ALREADY HAD AN EFFECT ON HER PERSONAL LIFE 
WHEN THE WHOLE GLAMOUR MODEL THING CAME ABOUT I DID HAVE A BOYFRIEND 
AND I THINK IT WAS MAYBE ONE OF THE FACTORS WHY WE MAYBE BROKE UP 
COS HE COULDN'T HANDLE WHAT I DID 
DEFINITELY I THINK HOW YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS COPE WITH IT IS THAT YOU JUST SEE IT AS A ROLE YOU'RE PLAYING 
IT'S JUST A JOB AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S JUST AN ACT 
AND I DO DEFINITELY MISS BEING AT HOME BUT BEING AWAY HAS MADE ME 
APPRECIATE MY FAMILY AND MY HOME EVEN MORE 
AND 
IT'S ALWAYS NICE 
BUT IT'S MADE ME REALISE AS WELL THAT MY LIFE IS SORT OF MOVING TOWARDS LONDON NOW 
AFTER SIX SUCCESSFUL YEARS LOUISE'S LOOK SEEMS TO HAVE FALLEN OUT OF FAVOUR 
SO BEING BEHIND THE CAMERA HAS BECOME SOMETHING OF A NECESSITY 
WHEN I'M DOING MY PHOTOGRAPHY IT'S NOT REALLY WHAT I WANT TO BE DOING 
BECAUSE MY MODELLING'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO ME ALWAYS HAS BEEN ALWAYS WILL BE 
BUT THIS IS JUST SOMETHING I ACTUALLY ENJOY DOING 
I FEEL LIKE I AM ACTUALLY QUITE GOOD AT IT 
HELLO YOU ALL RIGHT 
HIYA NICE TO MEET YOU 
AMY ISN'T IT YEAH I'M AMY 
IN ORDER TO BUILD A PHOTOGRAPHER'S PORTFOLIO 
LOUISE IS SENT NEW MODELS FROM SAMANTHA'S AGENCY FOR TEST SHOOTS 
FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE BUT THE MONEY ISN'T GREAT 
I'M PRIVILEGED THAT SAMANTHA BOND'S SENDING ME MODELS BUT THEY DON'T EXPECT THE MODELS TO PAY 
SO I FIND MYSELF SAYING YEAH I'LL DO THE SHOOT AND THEN I'M OUT OF POCKET MYSELF 
ON THE DAY I COULD GO TO A CASTING 
OR JOB OR AN INTERVIEW WHATEVER IT BE AND GET PAID OR AT LEAST GO TO AN INTERVIEW TOWARDS GETTING A JOB 
IS THAT O. K. 
I CAN SEE WHY SAM LIKES YOU NOT ONLY HAVE YOU GOT BLONDE HAIR YOU'VE GOT BIG BOOBIES 
SO WHAT'S SAM SAID YOU THINKING OF JUST DOING COMMERCIAL OR GLAMOUR AS WELL 
NO GLAMOUR WHAT SIZE BOOBS ARE YOU 
THIRTY TWO E. 
D. DOUBLE D. E. 
SO YOU DON'T NEED YOUR BOOBS DOING THEN 
I'D LIKE TO GET THEM LIFTED JUST BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE GOT THEM 
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU HAVE TO COMPETE YOU'VE GOT BIG NATURAL BOOBS 
NATURAL ONES ARE GONNA SAG 
I THINK YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT WITH YOUR BIG NATURAL BOOBS ANYWAY 
NATURAL BOOBS 
SMALL TALK OVER IT'S TIME TO GET ON WITH THE SHOOT 
YOUR BOOBS ARE MASSIVE THANK YOU THANK YOU 
LOOK AT ME SLIGHTLY WHEN YOU DO IT 
LOOK AT ME AND DO IT 
THAT'S IT GOT IT I THINK IT'S GOING O. K. 
IT'S REALLY STRANGE TO SEE MYSELF IN DIFFERENT MAKE UP WITH DIFFERENT HAIR 
TO HOW YOU WOULD NORMALLY DO YOUR OWN HAIR AND MAKE UP 
YOU GET USED TO SEEING YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR A CERTAIN WAY 
DO THAT ORGASM FACE BUT WITH THE EYES SHUT 
I'VE GOT YOU LAUGHING INSTEAD I LOVE BEING IN FRONT OF THAT CAMERA AND I SUPPOSE THAT'S WHY 
I'M BEHIND IT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE WORK ISN'T NECESSARILY THERE FOR ME TO BE IN FRONT OF IT 
SO BEING BEHIND IT IS THE NEXT BEST THING 
ONCE THE SHOOT'S OVER LOUISE REFLECTS ON HER OWN MODELLING CAREER 
I JUST FEEL A BIT CRAPPY BECAUSE 
AMY CAME IN SHE'S TWENTY YEARS OLD SHE'S BRAND NEW 
NO ONE'S USED HER IN THE MAGAZINES OR NOTHING 
SHE'S NOT DONE ANYTHING ELSE I'M THE FIRST PERSON TO DO PHOTOS OF HER 
SO SHE'S GOT SOME NICE PRINTS FOR A BOOK NOW 
AND I CAN JUST IMAGINE SAM SENDING HER TO ALL THE MAGAZINES THAT I'M TRYING TO GET BACK IN WITH 
AND THEN IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE CRAP BECAUSE I CAN'T COMPETE WITH THIS 
BIG NATURAL BUSTED GIRL WHO'S NEVER DONE ANY MODELLING BEFORE I CAN'T COMPETE WITH THAT 
BACK IN ISLINGTON AT JEANY'S STUDIO SAM BOND HERSELF HAS TURNED UP 
HELLO DARLING I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE COMING 
SHE'S POPPED BY TO CHECK IN WITH HER MODELS 
MWAH NICE TO SEE YA 
IT'S A SURPRISE FOR JEANY WHO HASN'T SEEN SAM FOR FIFTEEN YEARS 
SO THE PAIR TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT ON OLD TIMES 
HOW LONG YOU BEEN IN THE BUSINESS NOW SAM THIRTY YEARS THIS YEAR 
REALLY YEAH 
SO WERE YOU A MODEL BEFORE THAT 
YEAH YEAH DID YOU DO PAGE THREE 
I WAS SORT OF STARTING TO RETIRE WHEN PAGE THREE STARTED I WAS ON PAGE THREE A COUPLE OF TIMES 
SAM AND JEANY ARE ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR NEW TALENT BUT FINDING THE NEXT STAR ISN'T EASY 
IT NEEDS SOMEONE TO COME ALONG THAT EVERYONE GOES MAD ABOUT 
LIKE YOU KNOW THERE ALWAYS IS A GIRL OF THE MOMENT 
THERE WAS JORDAN AND THERE WAS KELLY AND THERE WAS NELL 
AND MELINDA AND LUCY PINDER WE JUST NEED ANOTHER ONE 
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THE GIRLS TO MAKE A VERY GOOD LIVING 
I ALWAYS SAY THAT TO THEM YOU HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER JOB AS WELL 
THAT'S ANOTHER THING A LOT OF YOUNG GIRLS ARE RUSHING TO THOSE SURGEONS 
AND THEY'RE MUTILATING GIRLS' BODIES THEY'RE SO DISGUSTING A LOT OF THOSE BOOB JOBS 
I'VE SEEN SOME HORRENDOUS BOOB JOBS IF A JOB'S NOT WELL DONE IT HAS TO BE CORRECTED 
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'VE SAVED UP FOUR THOUSAND TO HAVE IT DONE 
WE'RE BEING A BIT GLOOMY AREN'T WE WE ARE REALLY YEAH IT'S NOT ALL GLOOM AND DOOM 
NO IT'S NOT IT'S FUN REALLY 
BUT IT IS LOOKING FOR THAT NEXT ONE THAT COMES ALONG 
BUT AS I SAY THERE ARE SO MANY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THAT SEND IN THEIR PICTURES BUT 
IT'S FINDING THE RIGHT ONE THAT SPECIAL GIRL 
SO COULD KATIE HART BE THE NEXT BIG THING 
NICE TO SEE YOU DARLING TAKE CARE 
BYE STEPHEN 
BYE SAM 
JEANY IS LEFT TO CHOOSE KATIE'S BEST SHOTS FOR THE DAILY STAR 
KATIE HASN'T EVEN BEEN IN ONCE YET BUT I'M SURE WHEN THEY SEE HER 
THEY'LL PUT HER IN STRAIGHT AWAY BECAUSE SHE'S VERY DAILY STAR 
BEAUTIFUL GIRL 
GREAT BOD I NORMALLY SEND THEM SIX SO THEY CHOOSE FIVE AND GET ONE EXTRA IN CASE THEY DON'T LIKE ONE 
AND THEN THAT'S IT 
IN MIAMI AMANDA HARRINGTON IS UP EARLY FOR A DATE WITH A D. J. 
IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I'VE JUST BEEN PICKED UP AND IT'S RAINING 
WE'RE GOING TO A RADIO STATION IN MIAMI 
SO WE'RE GOING THERE TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW ON THE RADIO 
THE MIAMI WEATHER HASN'T IMPROVED BUT AMANDA IS STILL ON THE EXPOSURE TRAIL 
SHE'S BEEN BOOKED ON A RADIO SHOW WITH ONE OF FLORIDA'S TOP SHOCK JOCKS 
I'M A BIT WORRIED ABOUT THIS RADIO INTERVIEW BECAUSE APPARENTLY THE 
HOST IS MEANT TO BE A BIT MAD 
AND IT'S A BIT EARLY TO BE A BIT MAD 
BUT I'LL BE ALL RIGHT ONCE I GET THERE 
GUYS THIS IS AMANDA 
YOU ALL RIGHT HIYA 
SID ROSENBERG IS THE RESIDENT SHOCK JOCK AT MIAMI'S SPORT A. M. RADIO

GOT HER GUEST SLOT IN THE HOPE THAT SHE'LL WIN SOME NEW AMERICAN FANS 
MY NEXT GUEST RIGHT HERE IN STUDIO AMANDA HARRINGTON 
ARE YOU A BRITISH SUPERMODEL 
THAT'S HOW YOU'RE DESCRIBED A BRITISH SUPERMODEL 
I WOULDN'T SAY SUPER BUT I'M TRYING TO BE 
YOU ARE SUPER AND YOU'VE GOT THAT ADORABLE LIVERPOOL ACCENT 
I WOULDN'T SAY I'M LIKE MEGA FAMOUS IN ENGLAND BUT I'VE DONE LIKE LOADS OF STUFF 
I'VE DONE ALL THE MEN'S MAGS AND I WRITE A COLUMN AS WELL IN LIVERPOOL IN THE NEWSPAPER REALLY 
I'M QUITE WELL KNOWN IN LIVERPOOL HOW ABOUT THAT NOW ARE YOU MARRIED RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND 
I'M SINGLE AT THE MOMENT 
WHEN I THINK OF A BRITISH GIRL 
BRITISH GIRLS ARE ALWAYS VERY VERY PALE LIKE THEY'VE BEEN DOING HEROIN 
THEY'VE GOT THE DARK HAIR THEY DON'T SHAVE THEIR UNDERARMS 
AND YOU WALK IN YOU LOOK LIKE A MIAMI SUPERMODEL YOU'RE TANNED YOU GOT BLONDE HAIR 
ARE YOU REALLY FROM ENGLAND HONESTLY 
EVERYONE THINKS I'M FROM RUSSIA OVER HERE 
WE'LL COME BACK EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED THREE SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX THE GORGEOUS

YOU'RE KILLIN' IT HOW GREAT IS SHE 
SHE'S DOING GREAT 
I'VE BEEN FINE THIS MORNING 
HE'S REALLY EASY TO TALK TO 
HE SORT OF CARRIES YOU AND DOESN'T GIVE YOU QUESTIONS WHERE YOU'RE STUCK 
AND STUTTERING AND DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY HE'S REALLY LIKE EASY GOING 
HE WANTS ME TO STAY HE WANTS TO TALK TO ME FOR LONGER SO THAT'S A GOOD SIGN 
EVERYONE'S LIKED ME SO FAR 
AFTER A QUICK BREAK SID IS BACK ON THE AIR WITH A FEW MORE PROBING QUESTIONS 
WHAT IS YOUR ULTIMATE GOAL WHAT DO YOU ASPIRE TO BE AT THE VERY END 
I LOVE MODELLING BUT ME ACCENT IS SO STRONG I DON'T THINK 
I'D BE ANY GOOD AT PRESENTIN' OR ACTIN' BECAUSE NO ONE UNDERSTANDS ME 
AND I FIND IT REALLY HARD TO JUST COMMUNICATE AND PEOPLE JUST GO ARE YOU RUSSIAN WHERE ARE YOU FROM 
WOULD YOU DO NAKED PICTURES PLAYBOY OR PENTHOUSE 
I'VE NEVER DONE TOPLESS ANYWHERE ELSE IN ENGLAND BUT I DID TEST FOR PLAYBOY AND THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY NUDE 
BUT I'M NOT GONNA GO DOWN THAT ROAD I'VE DECIDED NOT TO DO IT NOW 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS RIGHT NOW WOULD YOU DO IT 
NO HALF A MILLION DOLLARS 
NO ONE MILLION YEAH 
ONE MILLION POUNDS NOT DOLLARS 
BY THE WAY YOU HAVE AN OUTSTANDING 
WHAT ARE YOUR MEASUREMENTS OVER THERE 
IT'S DOUBLE D. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS OVER HERE

THEY'RE FAKE IT'S A VERY GOOD JOB DID YOU GET THAT DONE IN AMERICA 
I SPENT MY MONEY WELL DIDN'T I 
SHE IS THE GORGEOUS AMANDA HARRINGTON WE'RE COMING BACK RIGHT AFTER THESE 
YOU WERE GREAT HOW GOOD IS SHE GREAT 
OH MY GOD 
NEXT TIME ON GLAMOUR GIRLS AMANDA MAY HAVE CONQUERED RADIO IN THE U. S. 
BUT THE PHOTO SHOOTS ARE ANOTHER STORY 
NO POINT IN STARTING UNLESS THE HAIR AND MAKE UP'S DONE PERFECTLY BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORTH IT 
STRUGGLING MODEL LOUISE LANDS A CATWALK JOB 
THIS IS MY LITTLE TIME TO SHINE AND SHOW PEOPLE WHAT I REALLY LOOK LIKE 
THIS IS THE REAL ME SHOW A BIT OF MY PERSONALITY AS WELL 
AND GLAMOUR GIRLS RHIAN AND KATIE GET TO RUB SHOULDERS WITH THEIR ADORING FANS 
I WONDER WHAT PEOPLE THINK WHEN THEY LOOK AT YOUR PICTURE 
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT ALL THESE MEN ARE GONNA BE LIKE OFF YOUR PICTURES
