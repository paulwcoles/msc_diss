ROLPH HAD'S MARK KING CERTAINLY 
WASN'T DID AT THE END OF HIS MATCH 
AGAINST MARK SELBY LAST YEAR'S 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP RUNNER UP THAT 
IS THE MATCH FEATURED IN THIS 
SNOOKER EXTRA PROGRAMME WITH MARK 
SELBY LEADING FIVE TO FOUR AS WE GOING TO 
THE EVENING SESSION HE MAY HAVE TO GO UP FOR THE BLUE 
THIS IS THE LAST OF THE OPEN REDS 
HE NEEDS AN ANGLE ON A COLOUR TO 
BRING THE REDS INTO PLAY HE HAS 
PLAYED THAT WELL HE HAS A NICE 
ANGLE ON THE BLUE HE DOES KNOW ANY 
TO PUT IN THAT MUCH PACE BECAUSE IF 
HE HITS THE PINK 
FULL ON 
IT WILL 
RELEASE THE REDS INTO THE CORNER I 
DO NOT THINK HITTING THE PINK FOOL 
OR IN IS GOING TO RELEASE ALL THOSE 
REDS JUST A CONTROLLED CANNON 
THERE IS A LITTLE BIT UNLUCKY BUT I 
DO NOT THINK HE HAS GOT THE CANNON 
QUITE AS HE INTENDED HE IS UNLUCKY 
TO COVER THIS BUT IT HAS ONLY 
RELEASED THAT WON THE RED TOWARDS 
THE CORNER 
HE HIT THE PINK HE IS 
UNLUCKY TO BE SNOOKERED BY THE 
BLACK 
HE IS GOING TO TRY TO GET THE WEEK 
OVER TO THE WHITE SOMEWHERE OVER 
NEAR THE 
CIRCLE SO 
YOU WILL BE ON 
THE BLACK 
TO POT 
THE RED 
HE WILL 
HAVE TO 
BE VERY 
PRECISE BUT 
THE TYPE OF 
SHOT HE 
IS LOOKING HOUR 
CAN HE 
GET THE WHITE WHERE HE 
CAN HE GET THE WHITE WHERE HE WANTS IT IS ALL GOING WRONG AND HE 
HAS LEFT MARK THE CHANCE HE HAS 
LEFT A CHOICE OF REDS WHAT A 
CHANCE FOR MARK KING 
IT WAS A GOOD PLAN BUT YOU NEED TO 
GET CLOSE TO POT 
ROY WAS WALKING OVER HERE FROM THE 
HOTEL THIS MORNING AND I THOUGHT 
ONE HUNDRED CLOCK IN THE MORNING YOU 
FORGET WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO PLAY AT 
ONE HUNDRED CLOCK IN THE MORNING 
INTERESTING YOU SHOULD SAY THAT 
BECAUSE THE GREAT JOHN SPENCER WHO 
WAS A THREE TIME WORLD CHAMPION AND 
THE FIRST EVER WINNER UP AT THE 
CRUCIBLE WHEN 
HE WAS 
ON A 
AT TEN 
IN 
THE MORNING HE WOULD 
BE UP AT 
FIVE 
HOUR AND WANDERING AROUND SHEFFIELD 
AT SIX JUST TO GET HIMSELF WEEK IN 
TIME FOR THE SESSION 
I HAVE DONE 
THAT MYSELF WALKING AROUND 
SHEFFIELD WHEN THE MILK WAS BEING 
DELIVERED 
I HOPE THAT YOU DID NOT DELIVERED HAVE YOU'RE CUE WITH YOU 
HER I 
DIDN'T BUT I WAS TEMPTED TO PINCH 
A BOTTLE OF MILK 
THIS IS A REPLICA OF THE OPENING 
FRAME MARK KING HAD THE LEAD AND 
MARK SELBY MADE FANTASTIC FIFTY FIVE 
CLEARANCE IT LOOKS LIKE MARK KING 
WILL BE RETURNING THE COMPLIMENT 
HERE HE HAS LEFT HIMSELF STRAIGHT 
ON THE BLACK BUT THERE IS NO 
PROBLEM 
HE NEEDED A LITTLE BIT OF A REVERSE 
SIDE ON THAT JUST WATCH THE WHITE 
AS IT COMES OFF THE CUSHION HERE 
I'M NOT SURE IF THE RED NEXT TO THE 
PINK IS POTABLE INTO THE RIGHT HAND 
CORNER HE IS COMING ROUND TO HAVE 
A LOOK AT IT IF IT WOULD GO HE 
COULD DEVELOP THE DIFFICULT RED 
NEAR THE CUSHION BUT THAT LOOKS 
TIGHT TO ME HE DOES NOT HAVE TO 
PLAY THE CANNON BECAUSE THERE IS 
ONE ON THE GREEN SPOT AS WELL BUT 
NOW THE BLUE HAS COVERED THE ONE 
ON THE GREEN SHORT HE DOES THIS 
OCCASIONALLY HE LOOKS GOOD AND 
THEN HE WINS OUT OF POSITION HE HE HAS TO CUT HIMSELF ON ALL THREE 
REMAINING REDS HE HAS SNOOKERED 
HIMSELF 
IF HE CAN GET PAST THE HIMSELF PINK IT MAKE THE WORTH TRYING TO 
CUT THAT PINK BACK INTO THE CORNER 
POCKET AS LONG AS HE MISSES THE 
PINK HE IS GOING TO GO CLOSE TO 
POTTING THE RED 
HE GIVES THE CUSHION LITTLE THUMP 
THAT WAS A GREAT CHANCE FOR HIM THAT WAS NOT ONE OF MARK SELBY'S 
BEST HE WANTS A BETTER ANGLE ON 
THIS DEAL YEAR LOW YELLOW 
THIS YEAR LOW TO GO ON IN FRONT 
THIS YELLOW 
THAT LOOKED A FAIRLY 
STRAIGHTFORWARD ALTHOUGH HE COULD 
HAVE BEEN ON THEIR EAR LOW OR THE 
BROWN THE YELLOW 
THAT IS TWO 
SHOTS HE HAS PLAYED AND HIT THEM 
TOO THICK THAT MISS ON THEIR 
YELLOW COULD HAVE COST HIM THIS 
FRAME HE HAS GOT WORK TO DO NOW HE PLAYED IT WELL AND HAS 
JUST THE 
RIGHT ANGLE ON 
THE PINK 
TO DROP OR 
AND THIS RED EIGHT POINTS IN THE 
LEAGUE BUT WITH A DIFFICULT BLUE 
IN THE LEAD 
THAT IS THE LINE THAT HE COULD TAKE 
IF HE COULD JUDGE IT SOMEWHERE OR 
AND THAT LINE WOULD LEAVE HIM 
PERFECTLY ON THE YELLOW 
HE TRIED TO SCREW IT STRAIGHT DOWN 
THE TABLE BUT HE HAS GOT THE WRONG 
ANGLE YELLOW ON THIS YELLOW 
THESE ARE TRICKY TO ONES 
THIS IS THE KEY BALL NOW EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN POINTS AHEAD HE NEEDS GREEN AND 
BROWN HE DID WELL 
TWENTY FIVE AHEAD WITH JUST EIGHTEEN REMAINING ON 
THE TABLE THIS BLUE INTO THE 
CORNER POCKET WILL JUST COMPLETE 
THE OPENING FRAME BOTH PLAYERS 
HAVE HAD CHANCES BUT IT IS MARK 
KING WHO GETS OFF TO A GOOD START 
AND TAKES THE OPENING FRAME GOOD CUEING THERE 
HE SEEMS TO BE VERY GOOD HOUR THIS 
TYPE OF SHOT 
YESTERDAY MARK BROKE OFF HID T. 
BLUE ON THE WAY DOWN AND POTTED IT 
INTO THE GREEN CORNER POCKET IT 
HAPPENS VERY VERY RARELY 
WELL IF 
YOU CATCH THE BLUE YOU'RE NEVER SURE WHERE IT WILL END UP 
THEY HAVE ONLY PLAYED EACH OTHER 
ONCE THESE BOYS AND MARK KING 
CAME OUT ON TOP IN THE TWO THOUSAND AND FOR 
THE DISH OPENED FIVE TO TWO SINCE THEN 
MARK SELBY HAS CHANGED HIS CUE 
ACTION SOMEWHAT AND HE HAVE BEEN 
REVELATION ONE OF CONSISTENT 
PLAYERS IN THE GAME OVER 
THE LAST COUPLE OF SEASONS 
HE IS 
ON THIS RED AND A THINK HE COULD 
JUST CANNON THE RED TO THE LEFT OF 
THE BLACK AND BRING THE BLACK INTO 
PLAY HERE IT IS WORTH THE RISK I I THINK THAT IS ON AS WELL A 
DELICATE LITTLE CANNON 
IF HE CAN 
GET THE BLACK AVAILABLE THIS COULD 
BE A CHANCE TO MAKE A SIZEABLE 
CONTRIBUTION JUST DROPPING ONE 
INTO THE LEFT MIDDLE I DON'T SEE 
IT COULD BE THE KEY OR THE PATH TO 
A FRAME WINNING CONTRIBUTION 
HE DECIDED NOT TO CHANCE IT AND 
PLAYED FOR THE PINK INTERESTING TO 
SEE NOW WHETHER HE CAN AGAIN ENOUGH 
POINTS AT THIS VISIT TO WIN THE 
FRAME IT WILL BE DIFFICULT WITHOUT 
THE BLACK TO GO AT 
IS THE PINK 
SPOT CLEAR THE PINK IS GOING ON 
THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE NOW SO 
THE ONLY HAS THE BLUE TO WORK WITH 
TO MAKE IT EASY TO GET BACK TO THE 
REDS THAT IS A POOR POSITIONAL SHOT 
IT WILL BE AWKWARD BECAUSE IF HE 
TRIES TO SWING ROUND THE TABLE HE 
HAS THE GREEN AND THE WAY IN THE 
WAY HE HAS AVOIDED ALL THE COLOURS 
BUT STILL WON'T BE EASY IT WAS THE 
PREVIOUS SHOT NOT GETTING THE 
RIGHT SIDE OF THE BLUE 
LOTS OF TOP AND RUN THROUGH HE HAD 
THE CUE POWER UNLESS HE IS ON THE 
RED TO THE RIGHT CORNER HE IS ON 
NOTHING IS THERE PLANT THAT THAT WOULD BE A BONUS IT IS NOT 
IN 
WOULD BE A BONUS IT IS NOT IN ATTEMPTING NOT TO GET TOO STRAIGHT 
HE HAS RUN TOO FAR 
IT DEPENDS FOR TWO REDS IN THE 
PINK SPOT YOU WOULD THINK ONE OF 
THEM WOULD POT HE HAS THE ONE NEAR 
THE CORNER POCKET ALSO 
I THINK IT IS THE BACK ONE THAT 
WILL PROBABLY POT YES 
HE SCREWED BACK WITH REVERSE SIDE 
THERE SIDE TOOK THE BALL FURTHER UP 
THE TABLE THERE IT IS THE 
NUMBER OF PLAYERS WHO HAVEN'T BEEN 
PLAYING THE GAME TOO LONG PINK YOU 
HAVE TO PUT SIDE ON TO MAKE THE 
POTTING ANGLE AND DIDN'T REALISE 
HOW DIFFICULT IT MAKES THE SHOT 
HITTING THE BALL NEAR THE CENTRE 
MAKES THE POT EASIER 
MARK HAS KEPT 
THIS GAME VERY WELL L. SUGGESTED IF 
HE DIDN'T GET THE BLACK INTO PLAY 
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO WIN THE 
FRAME AT THIS VISIT IT IS AWKWARD 
NOW MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD SHOTS YOU 
SEE PROFESSIONAL SMITH IT IS 
BECAUSE THEY ARE USING SIDE 
PROFESSIONALS MAKES WELL HE 
JUDGED THAT ABSOLUTELY INCH PERFECT 
THAT IS A TERRIFIC SHOT AND HE NOW 
JUST NEEDS THE RED 
HE HAS DONE WELL HERE 
IT HAS BEEN 
A GOOD ALL ROUND BREAK BECAUSE HE 
HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE TABLE AS 
LONG AS YOU KEEP POTTING THEM THAT 
IS THE NAME OF THE GAME JUST POT 
AS MANY BALLS AS YOU CAN AS JOHN 
VIRGO USED TO SAY ON THE BIG BREAK 
MARK SELBY LOST THE FIRST FRAME 
THIS MORNING AND HE HAS DEFINITELY 
LOST THE SECOND SO LOTS TO THINK 
ABOUT THE IN FORM MAN 
LEICESTER WITH ANOTHER TERRIFIC POT 
MARK SELBY HAS TO RAISE HIS GAME 
AND QUICKLY 
A GREAT EFFORT THE FRAME WAS WELL 
AND TRULY ONE WON 
THAT IS THE FRAME MARK KING CAME 
OUT THIS MORNING TRAILING FIVE TO FOUR BUT 
HAS WON THE FIRST TWO THAT ONE IN 
STYLE 
HELLO WELL WHAT A TIMELY FLUKE 
THAT WAS HE IS PERFECT ON THE BLUE 
AND HE LOOKS TO HAVE BEEN PERFECT 
ANGLE 
HE COULD HAVE TAKEN THE ANGLE DOUBLE ON AS A SHOT TO NOTHING BUT 
TOOK THE SAFETY ON AND WITH THE 
RIGHT OVER THE POCKET THIS 
COULD BE ANOTHER KEY TURNING POINT 
YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE SKILL IN THE 
WORLD YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT BIT OF 
LUCK AND HE WILL SUFFER NOW 
PARTICULARLY IF MARK KING MAKES THE 
MOST OF THAT FLUKE AND WINS THIS 
FRAME 
SEE HOW CLOSE HIS HAND IS TO THE 
CUE BALL AT TIMES ON THE TABLE 
LET'S JUST SEE IF HE DOES IT AGAIN 
VERY FEW PLAYERS GETTING AS CLOSE 
TO THE CUE BALL WOULD DO BRIDGE 
HAND WITH THEIR BRIDGE HAND NOT 
FAR AWAY WAS IT HE HAS PLAYED A 
POOR POSITIONAL SHOT HE STILL HAS 
THE POT ON SHOULD RUN THROUGH 
IF HE POTS THIS AND EVEN SO THE 
CHANCE OF FINISHING ON THE BLUE 
THE PINK IS GOING TO BE DISTURBED 
AS WELL 
IT IS A TRICKY BLACK NOW JUST 
GOING TO WIPE THE CUE AND HIS HANDS 
HE KNOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS 
LOOK AT THE DETERMINATION ON HIS 
FACE 
THIS MORNING HE WAS FIVE TO FOUR FACE BEHIND AND THEN TO WIN ALL FOUR 
FRAMES OF THE FIRST SESSION IS 
WELL A BONUS BUT IT IS A 
POSSIBILITY NOW HE HAS PLAYED THAT 
DELIGHTFULLY 
THIS IS AS WELL AS DELIGHTFULLY MARK KING HAS PLAYED FOR A LONG 
TIME VERY IMPRESSED WITH HIM IN 
THIS MATCH 
YOU TALK TO OTHER 
PLAYERS WHO PRACTISED WITH HIM ALI 
CARTER AND THE LIKE AND THEY WILL 
TELL YOU ON THE PRACTICE TABLE HE 
NEVER MISSES A BALL HE WOULDN'T BE 
THE FIRST PLAYER WHO DOESN'T 
PRODUCE HIS BEST CONSISTENTLY IN 
TOURNAMENTS HE HAS THE POT ON TO 
THE LEFT 
I KNOW SOMEONE WHO WOULD BE VERY 
INTERESTED IN THIS ROCKY TAYLOR 
THE STUNT WON HIM THE EARLY BOWLING FOUR WHEN HE GOT FOR MARK 
KING TO WIN 
THIS MATCH 
IT WOULD BE 
GOOD TO 
HAVE A FEW QUID ON IT FOUR 
GOOD TO HAVE A FEW QUID ON IT FOUR ONE IF MARK KING CAN PULL THIS OFF 
WE WILL ALL HAVE DRINK OR AND ROCKY 
MARK SELBY HAS IN THE MINDS ROCKY OF SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THE 
PLAYER 
OF THE 
SEASON SO FAR YOU 
WOULD EXPECT 
HIM TO 
MAKE A BOLD BID 
FOR THIS TITLE BUT HE IS 
STRUGGLING HERE MARK KING AFTER 
THIS BLUE JUST LOOKING FOR ONE 
MORE RED HE IS JUST CHECKING TO 
SEE IF ONE 
OF THESE 
REDS WILL 
GO TO 
THE RIGHT CENTRE LET'S SEE HOW HE 
PLAYS IT HE MUST THINK ONE WILL GO WHAT A TURN UP 
I EULOGISED ABOUT THAT BREAK BUT 
HOW DID IT START A FLUKE 
HE IS 
CUEING VERY WELL AT THE MOMENT 
I'M NOT QUITE CERTAIN WHAT HE'S 
PLAYING HERE BUT I DON'T THINK 
MARK'S WILL BE WILL BE BOTHERED 
ABOUT CARRYING ON MARK KING HAS 
WON THE FIRST FOUR FRAMES 
IT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT SHOT THIS 
HE CANNOT AFFORD TO MISS THIS THAT 
IS A GOOD SHOT LOTS OF PRESSURE 
PLAYED IT WELL PERFECT TOUR AND 
THE BLUE PERFECT ON THE BLUE 
MARK SELBY HAS GOT TO BE THINKING 
ABOUT WHO'S PERFORMANCE LAST YEAR 
HIS PERFORMANCE HOW HE CAME BACK 
FROM BEHIND AGAINST JOHN HIGGINS 
HE WAS TWELVE TO FOUR BEHIND CLOSED THE GAP 
AND THEN WHEN EIGHTEEN TO FOURTEEN WHEN YOU ARE 
IN THESE 
SITUATIONS IT IS GOOD TO 
HAVE NICE THOUGHTS 
IN YOUR 
ABOUT HOW WELL YOU DID PLAY OUT 
HERE AND HE HAS PROVED OVER THE 
LAST COUPLE OF SEASONS THAT UNDER 
PRESSURE HE CAN PRODUCE 
HE HAS A 
GOOD TRACK RECORD OF SHOWING PLENTY 
OF NERVE WHEN CALLED FOR ALI 
DON'T THINK HE HAS MUCH TO REPROACH 
HIMSELF WITH HE COULD HAVE ANY 
MORE CHANCES IN THE FIRST FRAME 
THIS 
MORNING BUT SINCE 
THEN HE HAS 
NOT DONE MUCH WRONG HE HAS 
THE CHANCES IT IS ALL ABOUT MARK 
KING 
IF YOU DROP BEHIND THE DEAL GOES 
YOU HAVE HAD OPPORTUNITIES AND 
MISSED THEM OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A 
LOT MORE 
PRESSURE WHEN 
YOU GET 
OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THIS BUT HE 
LOOKS COMPOSED IN CONTROL BUT 
UNDERNEATH HE WILL BE VERY 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE SCORELINE 
PLAYING FOR THE BLACK THIS TIME 
AND HE'S NICELY ON IT 
HE DOESN'T MIND TYING THE BLACK UP 
BECAUSE OF THE ADVANTAGE HE HAS IN 
THE FRAME HE CAN SCORE ENOUGH WITH 
THE BLUE AND THE PINK 
HE HAS GOT A LITTLE BIT OF WORK DO NOW 
IT THE 
GREEN IS 
NOT ON 
SPOT SO 
YOU SHOULD 
BE ABLE TO 
SWING 
THE 
SO ROUND 
THE 
ANGLES AND LEAVE 
HIMSELF THE CHOICE OF THREE REDS 
THE YELLOW IS OFF ITS SPOT NEEDS 
TO COME A BIT FURTHER A BIT SHORT 
IF THE WHITE COMES NEARER THE HE 
HAS A 
STRAIGHTFORWARD RED TO THE 
MIDDLE POCKET THIS IS MORE 
DIFFICULT INTO 
THE CORNER THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING THE CUE 
BALL WHERE YOU WANT IT MARK KING 
HAS TO HAVE A GO AT THIS RED 
A LONG WAY OUT HE'S LEFT THE ONE 
AT THE CUSHION MARK'S WILL THEY 
CAN POT THIS AND SCREW BACK FOR THE 
BLUE MARK SELBY 
THAT COULD WELL BE HIS FIRST FRAME 
OF THIS SESSION A VERY TIMELY 
FRAME TO WIN JUST A RED AND PINK NEEDED 
MARK'S WILL BE HAS GOT HIS FIRST 
FRAME ON THE BOARD 
AND CLOSES 
THE 
GAP TO JUST TWO FRAMES MARK 
SELBY 
HE IS STILL LOOKING AT THE SPORT 
INTO THE MIDDLE POCKET BUT IT LOOKS 
ALMOST CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD CANNON 
ANOTHER BALL THERE IS THE RED HE 
IS LOOKING AT EVEN IF HE TAKES IT 
ON IT IS JUST AS DIFFICULT THAT IS ANOTHER GREAT SHOT 
HE DID THIS IN THE PREVIOUS FRAME 
TOOK A CHANCE CAN HE HAS DONE IT 
AGAIN AND HE HAS DONE IT AGAIN 
WHEN YOU ROLL ONE ACROSS THE NAP IT 
IS EASY TO PUT IT AGAINST THE JAW 
OF THE POCKET JUST WANTED THAT CUE BALL TO 
LITTLE BIT FURTHER 
HE IS ON THE 
BLACK BUT HE IS HAMPERED HASN'T 
GOT A LOT TO DO WITH CUE BALL SO THAT 
MAKES IT 
A LITTLE 
EASIER BUT IT IS SLIGHTLY TRICKY 
HE LOOKS MORE RELAXED NOW AND MORE 
CONFIDENT JOHN AMAZING HOW HE WAS 
THREE FRAMES BEHIND BUT THAT IS THE 
SIGN OF A GREAT PLAYER TRUE 
CHAMPION ALL THE SKILL YOU NEED TO 
PLAY THIS GAME YOU CAN'T GOING TO 
BE A CHAMPION WITHOUT A GOOD 
TEMPERAMENT 
AND HE HAS THAT IN TEMPERAMENT SPADES HE HAS A REALLY GOOD 
TEMPERAMENT HE CAN EVEN SWITCH OFF 
AND HAVE A LITTLE JOKE WITH THE 
AUDIENCE 
SOMETHING YOU WILL ALWAYS CAPABLE 
OF DOING BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT 
IT WAS EASY WHEN IT WAS AN 
EXHIBITION BUT IN THE HEAT OF 
BATTLE 
THIS IS A TRICKY THIN ONE BATTLE BUT STRAIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
POCKET HE LOOKS VERY VERY 
COMFORTABLE OUT THERE THAT WAS A 
PRESSURE POT EIGHT TO SIX DOWN HE IS 
GROWING IN CONFIDENCE VERY 
IMPRESSIVE HERE 
THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE APART FROM 
THE FIRST FRAME WHERE BOTH PLAYERS 
HAD CHANCES MARK KING WON IT BUT 
THEN MARK SELBY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH 
CHANCE IN THE NEXT THREE YOU JUST 
HAVE TO STAY FOCUSED AND PATIENT 
YOUR CHANCE WILL COME EVENTUALLY 
LEAVING YOURSELF OPTIONS THAT 
WAS PERFECT 
THAT WAS A POSITIONAL SHOT NOT OF 
THE TOP DRAWER JUST A RED AND 
COLOUR NEEDED THIS BLACK WILL PUT 
HIM SIXTY IN FRONT WITH ONLY FIFTY NINE 
REMAINING 
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU SEEN IT 
WHEN THE MID SESSION INTERVAL 
CHANGES THINGS AROUND MARK KING 
TOOK ALL FOUR NOW IT IS ALL MARK 
SELBY 
YES FOR ONE WHO HAS THE RUN SELBY OF FRAMES GOING DOESN'T WANT THE 
INTERVAL TO COME THE OTHER GUY 
USES IT TO JUST TAKE STOCK 
THAT IS THE FRAME WELL AND TRULY 
OVER THE ONLY QUESTION NOW IS WILL 
WE SEE THE SECOND CENTURY OF THE 
MATCH 
EVEN IF WE DON'T WE WILL MATCH SEE MARK SELBY'S HIGHEST BREAK OF 
THE MATCH COMING JUST HAD THE 
RIGHT TIME HE HAD A SEVENTY SIX BREAK IN 
FRAME SEVEN HE HAS ECLIPSED THAT 
NOW 
IN HIS SHORT CAREER HE HAS MADE SIXTEEN 
CENTURIES AT THE CRUCIBLE 
HE MADE TWENTY NINE CENTURIES LAST SEASON 
AND HE HAS ALREADY MADE TWENTY FIVE THIS 
SEASON 
HE WILL NEED THAT DIFFICULT BROWN 
IT SHOULD BE O. K. IF HE GETS NICELY 
ON THE GREEN JUST DROPPING BEHIND 
THE BROWN HE WON'T BE PLAYING TO 
GET ON THE BLUE JUST ROLL THE 
BROWN IN TO MAKE HIS EIGHT TTH CENTURY 
IN HIS CAREER EIGHT TTH CENTURY EIGHTIETH CENTURY 
ANOTHER FRAME IN THE BAG MARK KING 
GETTING CONCERNED NOW HE WON THE 
FIRST FOUR BUT AFTER THE INTERVAL 
MARK SELBY HAS WON THE NEXT TWO 
NOW HE IS ONLY ONE BEHIND 
BRILLIANT IF ANYTHING HE HIT THIS 
TOO WELL THE REACTION WENT CLOSE 
THE CUE BALL WENT CLOSE TO THE SIDE 
CUSHION NOT A BAD SIGN IT MEANS 
YOU'RE CUEING PERFECTLY I SUPPOSE 
THE BLACK IS QUITE DISTANCE AWAY 
WHAT PUTS HIM OFF IS THE FACT HE 
WOULD HAVE TO PLAY IT DELICATELY 
BUT IT MIGHT BE WORTH A GO 
HE COULD GET THE CANNON ON THE RED 
WHICH IS SECOND FROM THE RIGHT AS 
WE LOOK I LIKE THAT ONE JOHN 
IN THE END HE PLAYED WITH MORE PACE 
AND TRIED TO DROP ON RED AT THE 
BOTTOM OF THE CLUSTER AND HE HAS 
JUST ABOUT 
THE BLACK IS ONLY AVAILABLE INTO 
ONE CORNER POCKET HE MIGHT PLAY 
FOR THE RIGHT OF THE TWO REDS THIS 
TIME TO GIVE IT OUT OF THE WAY 
HE TOOK HIS EYE OFF THE BLACK WHAT 
A MISS WHAT A MISS THAT WAS AND AND THERE YOU GO HE JUST THOUGHT SO 
MUCH ABOUT THE POSITION HE TOOK 
FOR GRANTED THE BLACK OFF THE SPOT 
SO JUST WHEN IT LOOKED AS THOUGH HE 
WAS IN AGAIN AND GETTING STRONGER 
BY THE SHOT BUDDING AS THOUGH HE 
HAD A CHANCE TO LEVEL THE MATCH A 
CHANCE FOR MARK KING THE FIRST 
SINCE THE MID SESSION INTERVAL TO 
PUT HIS HAND ON THE TABLE AND PUT 
SOME BALLS POT SOME BALLS 
WE KNOW HOW DETERMINED MARK KING IS 
HE HAS BEEN KEPT OFF THE TABLE BUT 
WE KNOW HE IS IN GOOD FORM 
CAN HE GET PAST THE BLACK YES HE 
CAN COMFORTABLY THERE IS A RED AT 
THE BOTTOM OF THE CLUSTER SO HE 
DOESN'T NEED TO PLAY ANY CANNONS 
HE PLACED THOSE SHOT BY CUEING IN 
MIDDLE OF THE BALL AND EVENTUALLY 
WHEN HE DELIVERS HE GOES LOW ON IT 
HE HASN'T PLAYED THAT WELL HE 
SHOULD HAVE HAD A BETTER ANGLE ON 
THE BLACK AND SURPRISED HE DIDN'T 
PLAY FOR THE BLACK IN THE SAME 
POCKET AS THE RED I AM SURPRISED 
HE HAS HAD A BONUS HERE BECAUSE I 
THINK THE RED IS ON L. DON'T THINK 
THAT WAS THE RED HE PLAYED FOR HE 
PLAYED FOR THE RED TO THE RIGHT OF 
IT THAT WAS A BONUS 
JUST WIPING THE CHALK MARKS OFF THE 
CLOTH WHEN YOU PLAY A SCREW SHOT 
IT TENDS TO LEAVE AND MARK A 
MARK HOW COSTLY IS THAT BLACK THAT 
MARK SELBY MISSED GOING TO BE HE 
CAN'T BELIEVE HE MISSED IT 
PERFECT HE IS BOUND TO CANNON ON 
TO THE FOUR BEDS AND HE WOULD BE 
UNLUCKY TO STICK ON THEM ONE IS 
DOING TO BE PUSHED TOWARDS THE 
RIGHT CORNER AND MAYBE ONE TOWARDS 
LEFT CORNER IF HE GOES INTO THE 
SEA HE MAY STICK IN TOO EASY 
HE WILL SETTLE FOR THAT WHAT A BIG 
FRAME THIS IS 
MARK SELBY MUST BE ABSOLUTELY 
SEETHING KICKING HIMSELF WHAT A 
CHANCE HE MISSED HE JUST TOOK HIS 
EYE OFF THE POT IT IS EASILY DONE 
HOW COSTLY IT COULD BE BECAUSE 
MARK KING IS NOW THE BIG FAVOURITE 
TO TAKE THIS FRAME AND HE'S GOT IT HE IS GOING TO NEED RED COLOUR RED 
THAT WAS SOME SORT OF STRANGE RING 
RINGTONE IF THE PERSON IS POTTED 
THEY WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE 
CRUCIBLE YOU ARE NOT 
ALLOWED INTO 
THE MASTERS GOLF WITH MOBILE PHONES 
I'M SURPRISED HE IS PLAYING THIS 
RED CLIVE THOUGHT HE MIGHT PLAY 
THE RED THAT 
IS LOW 
ON THE THREE 
IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE BUT THIS 
IS HIS DECISION HE HAS POTTED IT 
BUT HE HAS NOT COME HIGH ENOUGH ON 
THE 
BLACK THIS IS 
A TRICKY 
AND 
HE'S GOING TO 
HAVE TO PLAY 
GOOD SHORT 
TO GET 
THE 
CANNON AT 
SUCH AN ACUTE POTTING ANGLE HE HE NEEDS TO GET INTO 
THEM IF 
HE 
NEEDS TO GET INTO THEM IF HE JUST LOOKS 
THE END 
RED HEANEY WON OUT OF 
POSITION HE ME RUN OUT OF 
POSITION 
HE MAY 
HE HAS FLIPPED IT BUT PUT IT INTO A POTABLE POSITION POTTABLE 
IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW IF HE CAN 
GET THE CANNON ON THAT IS A BONUS 
MARK SELBY WILL BE SEEDING 
SEETHING 
BUT FAIR PLAY TO MARK SEETHING KING WORKS WILL BE HOW 
CLOSE THE 
GAP TO JUST 
ONE FRAME THE 
PROP 
THE PRESSURE 
WAS STARTING 
TO COME 
ON MARK KING BUT DIDN'T HE 
THAT WELL 
HE HAD 
BEEN KEPT OFF THE 
THAT WELL TABLE FOR TWO FRAMES 
HE HAS ALREADY HAD ONE CENTURY IN 
THIS MATCH AND HAS MADE FIFTY FOUR IN HIS 
CAREER 
HE MAKES A LOT OF A FRAME WINNING 
BREAKS BUT YOU WOULD 
ZERO X. A THAT 
HE 
MAKES A LOT OF CENTURIES FOUR THIS 
SEASON FIVE LAST SEASON YOU 
WOULDN'T FANCY 
THIS TRICKY BROWN WILL GIVE HIM 
THE CHANCE FOR THE CENTURY 
VERY WELL PLAYED 
FANTASTIC ANOTHER TERRIFIC 
EXHIBITION SHOT 
WHAT A COMEBACK FROM MARK KING 
THAT WAS A MAGNIFICENT CENTURY 
BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN 
HE GOT A NICE DOUBLE KISS WHAT A 
NICE FLUKE THAT WAS 
IT WASN'T OR ABOUT THE FLUKE OF OF COURSE THIS IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT 
FRAME 
AT THIS LEVEL WHEN THE MATCH AROUND 
THE FRAME IS SO TIGHT WHEN MARK 
KING FLEW THE RED HE TURNED ROUND 
AND APOLOGISED TO MARK SELBY BUT 
THERE WAS NO APOLOGY FOR PLAYING 
THE SNOOKER STRAIGHT AFTER 
HER I 
DIDN'T THINK HE COULD SEE 
ENOUGH OF 
THIS 
CUSHION HE IS 
HAVING TO 
PLAY 
THIS WITH 
A 
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT 
SIDE JUST TO MAKE THE ANGLE 
IS NOT QUITE HOW HE ENOUGH HAD 
ENOUGH HARD ENOUGH IS WAITING THE CUE AND A HANDS 
HE IS 
GOING TO TAKE THIS ON 
LOOK AT 
THE 
DETERMINATION ON HIS FACE 
HE IS GOING TO NEED THE FIVE 
REMAINING REDS THIS IS NOT 
FORMALITY HE IS GOING TO BE IN THE 
DRIVING SEAT YOU WOULD THINK HE HE IS LOOKING LONG AND HARD 
TO SEE IF 
THE RED PASSES THE PINK IF IT 
DOESN'T HE WILL HAVE TO GO ALL THE 
WAY AROUND THE TABLE IT MUST BE 
VERY TIGHT BUT IT LOOKS AS IF IT 
GOES 
WHAT SORT OF ANGLE HAS HE GOT CAN 
HE RUN THROUGH TO THE BLACK OR 
PINK HE CAN RUN IT THROUGH AND 
LEAVE HIMSELF ON THE PINK OR THE 
BLACK 
IT DEFINITELY GOES OUR CAMERA SHOW 
YOU THAT THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM 
IT LOOKS NATURAL JUST TO STUN IT AND 
PLAY FOR 
THE PINK IN THE 
OPPOSITE CORNER HE NEVER GOT 
THROUGH THAT AFTER ALL A BIT OF 
TENSION IN THE ARM IF HE GOES 
FURTHER THROUGH APPARENT OVER DOES 
IT THEN HE HAS THE OPTION OF THE 
BLACK 
THAT WAS JUST DOWN TO PURE BLACK TENSION THIS IS A BIG MOMENT IN 
THE CAREER OF MARK KING 
THROUGH TO 
THE SECOND ROUND OF THE CRUCIBLE IN 
THIS EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT C. O. M. WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
BOUND TO DO IT AGAINST THE IN FORM 
MARK SELBY 
ANXIOUS TIMES FOR THE JESTER FROM 
LEICESTER 
HE WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IT WASN'T 
AN EASY CHANCE TO CLINCH 
FRAME AND 
MARRIAGE BUT IT WAS A CHANCE MARKS 
L. D. WILL BE RELIEVED MARK KING HAS 
PUT HIMSELF 
IN A BIT 
OF TROUBLE 
HERE BECAUSE MARK SELBY CAN PUT 
THIS BACK DOWN TOWARDS THE YELLOW 
AND PUT MARK KING IN THE THAT OF 
TROUBLE HERE 
THAT WAS A VERY GOOD EFFORT FROM 
MARK SELBY 
THIS LOOKS A BET TO HOLD TO ME A 
BIT TOO HARD L. AM JUST WONDERING WHETHER HE COULD TAKE 
THE POT 
DEVELOP THE 
DIFFICULT RED 
NEXT TO THE BLUE HE WOULD FINISH 
UP ON A COLOUR YOU WOULD EXPECT 
LET'S SEE IF HE EAT IF HE HAS A 
GO AT THAT HE JUST ANY SURE OF THE 
POT YOU CANNOT BLAME 
HIM FOR 
THERE 
HE JUST NEEDS SURE MADE SURE 
YOU FEEL THAT THE BLUE MIGHT BE THE WAY 
BUT IF HE 
CAN JUST MISSED 
THE BLUE HE HAS DECIDED JUST 
TO 
POT THE GREEN AND THE SNOOKER BEHIND THE BLUE 
IT ISN'T EASY IT'S THE FROM 
BUT YOU NEVER 
WILL WELL THEY 
ARE GOING TO 
FINISH IT IS AN 
EASY SNOOKER YOU HAVE TO 
MAKE SURE 
YOU GET A 
BIT OF 
DISTANCE BETWEEN 
CUE BALL AND OBJECT BALL YOU CAN 
LOOK 
ALL THEY 
ARE AT 
THIS TYPE OF 
SHOT BUT YOU 
HAVE GOT 
TO RELY 
ON A 
LITTLE BIT OF GOOD FORTUNE HE'S 
GOING IN OFF 
AND THE RED IS LEFT 
UP LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE SCORE 
I DO NOT THINK THERE IS ANY LEE HE 
CAN ATTEMPT 
THE CLEARANCE 
AND HE 
BOUGHT LEAVE 
THE 
BLUE UNLESS HE 
COMES UP FOR PINK OR BLACK 
HE DOESN'T NEED THE AWKWARD BLUE 
SO THIS IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT BE ENOUGH 
COSTLY 
THAT IN OFF 
THAT SHOULD CLINCH THE FRAME JUST 
ONE SNOOKER IS REQUIRED BUT ALL 
THINGS BEING EQUAL IT SHOULD BE 
ENOUGH 
THE ONLY RED HE COULD LEAVE IS THE 
ONE HE IS HAVING A GO AT THERE WAS PRESSURE ON THAT ONE 
HE HAS FINISHED STRAIGHTER ON THE 
PINK HE MAY NEED THE FLED THE 
SIDE CUSHION 
IT WAS DIFFICULT BUT IT WAS A GOOD 
EFFORT 
WE HAVE SEEN PEOPLE PLAYING EFFORT AT THIS PACE INTO THE POCKET AND 
THE BALL HAS JUMPED OF THE POCKET 
BUT IF YOU ARE IN THE HEART OF THE 
POCKET IT DOESN'T GO OFF HE YOU 
HIT THE JAWS THE BALL CAN COME OFF 
THE TABLE 
HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH IT YOU WOULD 
HAVE TO SAY THIS IS NOT EASY UP 
THE CUSHION MARK SELBY WAS ANXIOUS 
WHEN HE KNEW HE DIDN'T PLAY THE 
SAFETY SHOT RIGHT 
WELL PLAYED PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE 
SHOUTING COME ON MARK BUT WE 
DON'T KNOW WHICH MARK DID BEEN WE 
HAVE TWO MARKS THERE WHICH MARK 
THEY MEAN 
THAT IS SUPERB AND 
COULDN'T HAVE LANDED BETTER COULD 
NOT HAVE LANDED BETTER PERFECT 
HE IS NICELY ON THE BLACK BUT NOW 
HE IS LOOKING FOR THE BLACK WILL GO 
HE MIGHT HAVE LOOKED BEFORE POTTING 
THE RED 
IT COULD BE TIED UP 
SOMEWHAT HERE BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER 
SPOTS OCCUPIED THE PINK IS ON THE 
BLACK SPOT THE BLACK WOULD STILL 
BE AVAILABLE FOR THE REFEREE EIRIAN 
WILLIAMS REPLACES IT HAS CLOSE TO 
THE PINK WITHOUT TOUCHING IT THE 
PINK WON'T POT BUT THE BLACK WILL 
GO 
HE IS O. K. HE IS O. K. 
THIS IS A TEST OF NERVE 
NOW THIS IS CHANCE TO WIN FRAME 
AND MATCH AT THIS VISIT IT IS JUST 
ALL ABOUT HOLDING US OF TOGETHER 
HOLDING US HAVE TOGETHER 
YOURSELF 
A COUPLE OF REDS TO PLAY ON ONE IN 
THE PINK SPOT ONE TO THE RIGHT OF 
THE FOUR 
HE WILL PROBABLY PLAY BACK FOR THE
