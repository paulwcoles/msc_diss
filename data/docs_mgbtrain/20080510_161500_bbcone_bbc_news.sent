RELIEF AGENCIES WARN OF AN 
INCREASING HUMANITARIAN DISASTER IN 
BURMA BURMA FEARS GROW ABOUT THE RISK OF 
DISEASE AND STARVATION 
ZIMBABWE'S OPPOSITION LEADER MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI SAYS HE WILL NOW TAKE 
PART IN A PRESIDENTIAL RUN OFF 
AGAINST ROBERT HAMMOND 
MUGABE 
AND A MASS CELEBRATION OF MARRIAGE 
WITH FORTY THREE THOUSAND YEARS OF WEDDED LIFE 
BETWEEN THEM 
GOOD EVENING AID WORKERS SAY 
THEY'RE IN A RACE AGAINST TIME TO 
PREVENT DISEASE AND STARVATION 
TAKING HOLD IN BURMA CYLONE NARGIS 
STRUCK A WEEK AGO BUT AID FOR THE 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SURVIVORS 
IS ONLY TRICKLING INTO THE COUNTRY 
TODAY BURMA'S MILITARY LEADERS 
WENT AHEAD WITH A REFERENDUM ON A 
NEW CONSTITUTION DESPITE CALLS FOR 
IT TO BE POSTPONED JONATHAN HEAD 
REPORTS FROM NEIGHBOURING THAILAND 
NOW A WASTE LAND OF MUD AND 
RUINED HOMES THIS IS TOWN OF 
PYOPON TORN APART BY WIND AND WATER 
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE BUILDING LEFT 
UNDAMAGED SO THE SURVIVORS NEED 
EVERYTHING FOOD SHELTER MEDICAL 
TREATMENT AND THEY'RE GETTING VERY 
LITTLE AT HOSPITALS IN THE DELTA 
THERE'S NO POWER NOW AND THE STAFF 
ARE OVERWHELMED DEALING WITH 
DISEASE INJURIES AND BIRTHS 
THE HEALTH OF YOUNG CHILDREN IS A 
SERIOUS CONCERN 
THE SITUATION IS 
REALLY OUT OF CONTROL IT'S TOO 
MANY PATIENTS AND VERY LITTLE HELP 
WE HAD TO ORGANISE WITH THE HIGHER 
AUTHORITY FOR FOOD SHELTER AND 
MEDICINES AND SANITATION KEY 
WORKERS 
BUT THE HIGHER AUTHORITIES WORKERS ARE TOO BUSY WITH THE REFERENDUM 
WHICH THEY'VE ENSURED THEY'LL WIN 
IT COULD ENSHRINE MILITARY 
DOMINANCE HERE FOR DECADES MORE 
BURMA'S RULER HAS BEEN INVISIBLE 
THROUGHOUT THIS CRISIS BUT HE DID 
SHOW UP TO VOTE PHOTO OPS ON STATE 
T. V. SHOW MILING OFFICERS HANDING OUT 
HELP TO THE CYCLONE'S VICTIMS BUT 
THE REALITY IS VERY DIFFERENT 
INTERNATIONAL AID IS JUST TRICKLING 
IN AND THE DISASTER EXPERTS NEEDED 
TO DISTRIBUTE IT ARE BEING KEPT OUT 
SEVEN DAYS AFTER THE CYCLONE STRUCK 
THE IRRAWADDY DELTA AND THIS IS 
WHAT THE INTERNATIONAL RELIEF 
EFFORT AMOUNTS TO A FEW PALETTES 
OF AID GOING IN ON PERHAPS JUST ONE 
OR TWO FLIGHTS A DAY YOU WOULD 
EXPECT THIS AIRPORT JUST AN HOUR'S 
FLIGHT FROM RANGOON TO BE TEEMING 
WITH INTERNATIONAL AID WORKERS BUT 
IT'S ALMOST DISERTED TWO PLANES 
WENT IN FROM THAILAND TODAY THE UN 
HOPES TO SEND IN ANOTHER THREE 
IT'S NO WHERE NEAR ENOUGH 
THE ZIMBABWEAN OPPOSITION LEADER 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI SAYS HE WILL 
TAKE PART IN A SECOND ROUND OF THE 
DISPUTED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
AGAINST ROBERT MUGABE UNTIL NOW 
MR. TSVANGIRAI HAD ARGUED THAT HIS 
PARTY WON MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF 
THE VOTE SO THERE WAS NO NEED FOR 
ANOTHER ROUND BUT SPEAKING IN 
SOUTH AFRICA HE SAID A SECOND POLL 
SHOULD BE HELD WITHIN A FORTNIGHT 
WITH FULL ACCESS FOR INTERNATIONAL 
OBSERVERS OUR SOUTHERN AFRICA 
CORRESPONDENT ORLA GUERIN REPORTS 
AFTER WEEKS OF WILL HE OR WON'T HE 
ZIMBABWE'S OPPOSITION LEADER 
STEPPED BACK INTO THE RACE TODAY 
SAYING A RUN OFF WOULD KNOCK OUT 
THE DICTATOR FOR GOOD 
WE WILL 
CONTEST THE RUN OFF AND THE PEOPLE 
WILL FINALLY PREVAIL THE PEOPLE 
HAVE SPOKEN BEFORE AND THE PEOPLE 
WILL SPEAK AGAIN I'M READY AND 
THE PEOPLE ARE READY FOR THE FINAL 
ROUND 
BUT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI WANTS ROUND THAT FINAL ROUND TO BE VERY 
DIFFERENT TO THE FIRST ONE HE'S 
CALLING FOR AFRICAN PEACEKEEPERS TO 
BE DEPLOYED AND FOR FULL ACCESS FOR 
FOREIGN OBSERVERS AND JOURNALISTS 
THERE'S BEEN NO COMMENT FROM 
PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE LAST SEEN 
YESTERDAY PLAYING HOST TO SOUTH 
AFRICA'S THABO MBEKI BUT HIS 
JUSTICE MINISTER HAS RULED OUT 
PRECONDITIONS FOR A RUN OFF 
AND HIS HENCHMEN ARE HARD AT WORK 
TERRORISING THE OPPOSITION THIS 
MAN IS ONE OF THE LATEST VICTIMS 
THERE ARE NOW ALMOST A THOUSAND 
REPORTED CASES ACCORDING TO A 
ZIMBABWE DOCTORS' GROUP WHO SAY THE 
VIOLENCE AND TORTURE ARE ESCALATING 
IF A SECOND ROUND DOES TAKE PLACE 
AND MANY HAVE THEIR DOUBTS IT WILL 
BE A BLOODY ONE AND A RISKY ONE 
FOR THE OPPOSITION THE BEATINGS 
AND THE BRUTALITY HAVE TAKEN THEIR 
TOLL AND SOME M. D. C. SUPPORTERS HAVE 
TOLD US THEY'LL BE TOO AFRAID TO 
VOTE 
IN LEBANON HEZBOLLAH FIGHTERS HAVE 
AGREED TO WITHDRAW FROM BEIRUT 
AFTER THE ARMY GRANTED THEM A 
NUMBER OF CONCESSIONS IT FOLLOWS A 
FOURTH DAY OF VIOLENCE BETWEEN 
GOVERNMENT FORCES AND OPPOSITION 
SUPPORTERS UP TO SIX PEOPLE ARE 
BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN KILLED AT A 
FUNERAL PROCESSION IN THE CITY AND 
ANOTHER TWELVE ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE DIED 
IN A GUN BATTLE IN NORTHERN LEBANON 
TONY BLAIR IS ADVISING GORDON BROWN 
ABOUT HOW TO WIN THE NEXT ELECTION 
ACCORDING TO CHERIE BLAIR HER 
COMMENTS CAME IN INTERVIEWS WHICH 
ACCOMPANY A EXTRACTS FROM HER 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN INTERNATIONAL 
NEWSPAPERS SHE ALSO SUGGESTS THAT 
GORDON BROWN WAS RATTLING THE KEYS 
OF DOWNING STREET OVER HER 
HUSBAND'S HEAD TO GET HIM OUT OF 
OFFICE BEFORE THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE ELECTION A 
LOVING SUPPORT AND A FORCE TO BE 
RECKONED WITH HER YEARS AT NUMBER 
TEN WERE COLOURFUL AND 
CONTROVERSIAL DOGGED BY A STORMY 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR NEIGHBOUR 
GORDON BROWN NOW SHE'S PUBLISHING 
HER VERSION OF EVENTS TONY BLAIR 
SHE SAYS WOULD HAVE STEPPED DOWN 
IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE IF MR. BROWN HAD BACKED HIS 
PROGRAMME FOR REFORMING SCHOOLS AND 
HOSPITALS SHE DESCRIBES GORDON 
BROWN AS RATTLING THE KEYS OF 
DOWNING STREET OVER HER HUSBAND'S 
HEAD HIS IMPATIENCE FOR THE JOB 
SHE SAYS WAS A DIFFICULTY TONY 
BLAIR COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT 
TENSIONS BETWEEN HERSELF AND GORDON 
BROWN ERUPTED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WHEN TONY 
BLAIR WAS FORCED TO MAKE A JOKE OF 
IT 
AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY IT ABOUT HER RUNNING OFF WITH THE 
BLOKE NEXT DOOR 
SHE'S SUCH A LOYAL 
WIFE TO HER HUSBAND THAT OBVIOUSLY 
THINK SHES TONY IS THE BEST TO BE 
PRIME MINISTER AND THE BEST AT 
EVERYTHING THEREFORE THAT WOULD 
MAKE FOR A DIFFICULT RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE MAN WHO WANTED TO REPLACE 
HIM SHE'D LANDED HERSELF IN 
POLITICAL HOT WATER BEFORE OVER HER 
VIEWS ON PALESTINIAN SUICIDE 
BOMBERS 
AS LONG AS YOUNG PEOPLE BOMBERS FEEL THEY HAVE NO HOPE BUT TO BLOW 
THEMSELVES UP WE'RE NEVER GOING TO 
MAKE PROGRESS ARE WE HER HER FRIENDSHIP WITH STYLE GURU CAROL 
CAPLIN AND FINALLY HER PARTING 
WORDS TO JOURNALISTS AS SHE LEFT 
DOWNING STREET 
I DON'T THINK WE'LL 
MISS YOU MRS. 
BOOK WASN'T 
MISS YOU DUE UNTIL THE AUTUMN IT COULD BE 
THE LAST THING THAT GORDON BROWN 
NEED BUT MRS. BLAIR SAYS HER 
HUSBAND HAS BEEN GIVING HIM ADVICE 
ON THE NEXT ELECTION AND THINKS HE 
COULD WIN 
SPORT AND IN THE SCOTTISH PREMIER 
LEAGUE RANGERS BEAT DUNDEE UNITED 
BY THREE GOALS TO ONE NACHO NOVO 
SCORED TWICE FOR RANGERS BEFORE 
UNITED WERE GIVEN HOPE WHEN MARK 
DEVRIES HEADED HOME WITH FOURTEEN MINUTES 
LEFT BUT IT WAS LEFT TO JEAN 
CLAUDE DARCHEVILLE TO SEAL THE 
VICTORY FOR RANGERS IN THE FINAL 
MINUTES THEY'RE NOW ONE POINT 
BEHIND LEADERS CELTIC WITH A GAME 
IN HAND 
BRAZIL'S FELIPE MASSA WILL START 
TOMORROW'S TURKISH GRAND PRIX FROM 
POLE POSITION IT WILL BE THE 
FERRARI DRIVER'S THIRD CONSECUTIVE 
POLE BRITAIN'S LEWIS HAMILTON IN

ANDREW FLINTOFF HAS BEEN RULED OUT 
OF THE FIRST TWO TESTS OF ENGLAND'S 
SERIES AGAINST NEW ZEALAND WHICH 
BEGINS ON THURSDAY THE LANCASHIRE 
ALL ROUNDER WHO HASN'T PLAYED A 
TEST MATCH FOR MORE THAN A YEAR 
SUFFERED A SIDE STRAIN DURING HIS 
COUNTY'S MATCH AGAINST DURHAM 
MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED COUPLES WITH FORTY THREE THOUSAND 
YEARS OF MARRIAGE BETWEEN THEM 
HAVE BEEN RENEWING THEIR VOWS AT A 
SPECIAL MASS AT WESTMINSTER 
CATHEDRAL 
BY THE ARCHBISHOP OF WESTMINSTER 
CARDINAL CORMAC MURPHY O'CONNOR 
WHO SAID THE INSTITUTION OF 
MARRIAGE IS DEEPLY IMPORTANT TO 
BRITAIN'S FUTURE FOR BETTER FOR 
WORSE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY COUPLES WHO HAVE BEEN 
TOGETHER FOR A TOTAL OF FORTY THREE THOUSAND 
YEARS PEOPLE LIKE THE O'DRISCOLLS 
CHILDHOOD SWEETHEARTS WHO TODAY 
REPEATED PROMISES MADE SIXTY ONE YEARS AGO 
BUT LIFE LONG COMMITMENT HAS GONE 
OUT OF FASHION WITH MARRIAGE AT 
ITS LOWEST LEVEL EVER AND DIVORCE 
TOUCHING ALMOST FORTY PER CENT 
I CALL IT A 
TIME BOMB BECAUSE IT'S INSIDIOUS 
IT'S STARTING NOW WITH THESE PAST 
THIS PAST YEAR THE GROWTH OF 
DIVORCE AND BREAK UP BUT THE 
EFFECTS OF IT WILL GO ON AND ON 
UNLESS SOMEHOW SOCIETY COMES TO SEE 
AND HOPEFULLY OUR YOUNG PEOPLE 
WHO ARE GOING TO GET MARRIED WILL 
BE ABLE TO SEE THAT FAITHFUL LONG 
TERM MARRIAGE PERMANENT MARRIAGE 
IS A BLESSING A BLESSING NOT ONLY 
FOR THEM BUT A BLESSING FOR THE 
SOCIETY 
THE O'DRISCOLLS SAY THAT SOCIETY MARRIAGES ARE FAILING BECAUSE 
PEOPLE SIMPLY WON'T WORK TO 
MAINTAIN THEM 
WHEN THINGS GO WRONG 
IT'S NO GOOD BRUSHING THINGS ASIDE 
JUST SPEAK ABOUT IT IF YOU LEAVE 
IT THINGS GET WORSE 
TWO LITTLE 
WORDS YES DEAR 
MANY OF THESE PARTNERSHIPS DATE 
FROM A TIME WHEN MARRIAGE WAS 
ACCEPTED AS THE BEDROCK OF SOCIETY 
THE CHURCHES SAY IT REMAINS AS 
ESSENTIAL FOR FAMILY LIFE AND THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF LOSING IT COULD BE 
DISASTROUS FOR US ALL 
AND THAT IS ALL FROM ME FOR NOW 
I'LL BE BACK HERE WITH THE LATEST 
ON B. B. C. ONE AT TWENTY TO ELEVEN HUNDRED AND 
RIGHT NOW ON B. B. C. ONE IT IS TIME TO 
JOIN OUR TEAMS WHEREEVER YOU ARE 
GOOD EVENING FROM B. B. C. LONDON NEWS 
THE FIRST PLASTIC BAG FREE ZONE IN 
THE CAPITAL RESIDENTS AND TRADERS

FREE AREA IN LONDON AFTER GAINING 
THE SUPPORT OF LOCAL BUSINESSES WHO 
FUNDED THE SCHEME 
I HAVE BEEN 
USING THE BAGS FOR ABOUT A MONTH 
NOW AND FIRST OF ALL I THOUGHT IT 
WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SWAP FROM 
PLASTIC TO THE COTTON BAGS THAT 
YOU'VE SEEN BUT ACTUALLY I TAKE 
ONE WITH ME IN MY BRIEFCASE EVERY 
MORNING WHEN I GO TO WORK AND IF I 
NEED THE BUY A BIT OF SHOPPING I 
JUST USE IT L. AM FINDING IT EASIER 
AND EASIER 
THIS INITIATIVE AIMS TO 
SLIGHTLY DENT THE AMOUNT OF BAGS 
CONSUMED IN LONDON EACH YEAR AT 
THE MOMENT OVER FIFTEEN BILLION BAGS 
ARE DISPOSED OF IN LANDFILL SITES 
CAMPAIGNERS HOPE THIS SCHEME WILL 
BE ROLLED OUT ACROSS BRITAIN IN IN BRITAIN WE SPENT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION A 
YEAR ON THESE BAGS AND WE'RE 
THROWING THEM AWAY SO BASICALLY 
WE'RE DUMPING A N. H. S. HOSPITAL EVERY 
YEAR FOR NOTHING SO I DON'T THINK
