MAYBE YOU COULD ANSWER A QUESTION FOR ME 
IT'S JUST YOU DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND SO I WAS 
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU EVER 
RELAX WITH CERTAIN READING MATERIAL IN YOUR SPARE TIME 
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN OF COURSE 
I'M CURRENTLY READING MOBY DICK 
AND ENGLISH ISN'T EVEN ONE OF MY SUBJECTS 
UH HUH I WAS 
I WAS THINKING MORE 
ALL BLOKES READ MAGAZINES LIKE THIS DON'T THEY 
NOT THIS ONE 
FREEZING ME OUT

OH DEAR SAID ALL THE WRONG THINGS DID I MAYBE YOU WON'T INVITE ME TO THE BABY SHOWER 
SO WHAT HAPPENED AFTER I LEFT 
RONNIE TELL YOU YOU MADE A MISTAKE AND SHE'D PUT EVERYTHING RIGHT 
IT'S MORE COMPLICATED 
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT 
ONE FOR THE GIRLS IS IT ROX 
I CAN'T GET RID OF THE BABY 
DON'T MEAN YOU CAN DO IT THOUGH DOES IT 
LIKE WHAT WELL I'M GUESSING YOU HAVEN'T TOLD RONNIE WHO THE FATHER IS 
I DON'T KNOW WHO THE FATHER IS 
YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TWO CHOICES 
YOUR SISTER'S EX OR THE LOCAL NUTTER 
AND IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE ONE OF 'EM HAS A CLUE NO 
NO I CAN MANAGE THIS 
RONNIE'S GONNA HELP ME HELP YOU BRING UP JACK'S KID 
I ALREADY TOLD YOU IT MIGHT NOT BE HIS 
YOU DON'T KNOW 
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THIS 
SOONER OR LATER THE LIES WILL CATCH UP WITH YOU ROXY 
I'M ONLY THINKING OF YOU 
AND THAT I WON'T BE AROUND TO PARTY 
MAYBE THIS HAS MADE ME REALISE THERE IS MORE TO LIFE THAN WAKING UP EVERY MORNING WITH A HANGOVER 
OR JACK BRANNING OR SEAN SLATER 
COME ON YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO HANDLE LIVING HERE KNOWING ONE OF THOSE GUYS IS THE FATHER 
WATCH ME 
SOMEONE'S LET ME DOWN AND I NEED YOU 
TO D. J. AT THE CLUB IF YOU CAN DO IT I'LL MAKE IT WORTH YOUR WHILE 
ONE HUNDRED QUID FOR THREE HOURS CASH 
MAKE IT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY AND YOU'RE ON 
DONE 
I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW SORRY I AM FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT I'VE SAID TO YOU 
I'M SURE YOU DIDN'T BRING ME ALL THIS WAY FOR AN APOLOGY 
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME THE REAL REASON 
YOU ARE THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY 
AND WHILE MASOOD'S AWAY I'VE BEEN LEFT TO RUN THE BUSINESS ON MY OWN 
YOU'VE PROBABLY DONE A BETTER JOB OF IT THAN MY BROTHER THE FLAT FOOTED POSTMAN 
PLEASE DON'T MAKE FUN OF HIM 
BUT I'VE DONE IT ALL MY LIFE 
AND WITH GOOD CAUSE 
WHEN IT COMES TO BUSINESS YOUR HUSBAND MAKES A VERY FINE POSTMAN 
THAT'S NOT FAIR 
MASOOD HAD HIS OWN COMPANY 
AND A CHANCE TO MAKE SOMETHING OF HIMSELF 
BUT WE BOTH KNOW WHAT HE DID WITH IT 
HE CAN'T EVEN PROVIDE PROPERLY FOR HIS OWN FAMILY 
HE DOES HIS BEST BUT IS IT GOOD ENOUGH 
FACE IT THE MAN'S A FAILURE 
WHEREAS YOU 
ARE A GREAT SUCCESS 
A WEALTHY MAN BLESSED WITH FORTUNE 
WHICH IS WHY YOU'RE ABOUT TO ASK ME FOR MONEY 
I WAS THINKING OH YEAH 
YEAH I'VE GOT TONIGHT OFF SO IF IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU 
WHEN'VE YOU EVER ASKED IF ANYTHING'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME I'M ASKING YOU NOW 
WHAT WANNA GO OUT FOR A DRINK WITH HEATHER OR SOMETHING NO 
I WANNA STAY IN COOK YOU A MEAL DO YA 
AMAZING I DIDN'T THINK SHE COULD DO IT BUT I AIN'T SEEN HER JUMP DOWN HIS THROAT ONCE 
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT SHE'S TRYING TO BE NICE 
YEAH TO VINNIE 
SEE SHE KNOWS THEY MIGHT NOT BE WELL YOU KNOW THE PERFECT COUPLE 
BUT SHE'S REALLY TRYING TO MAKE THINGS WORK 
BECAUSE HE LOVES HER EVER SO MUCH 
I'D BETTER GO 
SO YOU UP FOR A FEW BEVVIES LATER 
CELEBRATE THE HOBSTER'S RETURN 
I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO GO OUT WHAT ELSE YOU GONNA DO WATCH HEATHER POLE DANCE 
ACTUALLY IT WAS QUITE FUNNY AFTER THE INITIAL SHOCK 
BEST TELL HER THOUGH EH 
LOOK HEATHER CAN DO WHAT SHE WANTS AND I'LL SUPPORT HER 
IF SHE WANTS TO POLE DANCE I MIGHT EVEN PUT UP A PROPER POLE 
DON'T ATTACH IT TO THE CEILING MINE'S A PINT 
WE SHOULD MAKE AN EFFORT YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO WHAT CHELSEA WANTS 
IT'S HER BIRTHDAY NOT YOURS 
I KNOW CHELSEA MAN SHE'D EXPECT ME TO ARRANGE SOMETHING YOU WAIT 
THE USUAL FOR ME 
TRYING TO BE NICE SHIRLEY 
THAT'S WHAT HEATHER SAID 
THERE'S A FAVOUR YOU COULD DO FOR ME OH YEAH 
IT WOULD JUST BE A LOAN 
A SIMPLE BUSINESS TRANSACTION 
IN MY EXPERIENCE BUSINESS IS RARELY SIMPLE 
IT WOULDN'T BE FOR LONG 
I HAVE MANY IDEAS OF HOW TO TURN THE BUSINESS ROUND 
I CAN WRITE THEM ALL DOWN FOR YOU IF YOU WANT 
MAKE A PROPER PLAN 
I KNOW A MAN WITH YOUR BUSINESS ACUMEN WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THAT 
OF COURSE 
IT'S ALL IN THE DETAIL ISN'T IT 
SOMETHING MASOOD NEVER REALLY COULD APPRECIATE 
THE WAY THE SMALL EFFORTS ALWAYS PAY OFF 
COME ON 
ARE YOU REALLY AS DESPERATE AS YOU'D HAVE ME BELIEVE 
OR PERHAPS JUST A LITTLE LONELY 
FOR YOU 
THE GREAT INZAMAM 
THE PILLAR OF OUR COMMUNITY 
IF PEOPLE ONLY KNEW WHAT YOU WERE REALLY BUT THEY DON'T 
AND YOU WON'T BE TELLING ANYONE 
OR I MIGHT JUST HAVE TO MAKE A DISCLOSURE OF MY OWN 
WOULD YOU REALLY BE HAPPY WITH EVERYONE KNOWING ABOUT YOU ZAINAB 
INCLUDING YOUR LOVELY DAUGHTER AND YOUR DUTIFUL SON
