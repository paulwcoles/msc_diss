WELCOME TO THE ONE SHOW WITH 
CHRISTINE BLEAKLEY 
AND ADRIAN 
CHILES AN ACTOR WHO GREW N. U. P. THE 
SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS BECAME A MOVIE 
STAR AND IS ONE OF BROADWAY'S MOST 
WANTED 
ALAN CUMMING GOOD TO HAVE WANTED YOU HERE HARK 
COULD IT 
BE THAT OUR SEARCH FOR A NEW PERCY 
EDWARDS HAS WORKED 
MIKE DILGER 
WILL BE SHOWING THE SONGSTERS THE 
ONE SHOW HAS MANAGED TO CHARM OUT 
OF THE TREE 
FIRST HOUSE PRICES 
THEY HAVE DROPPED GREAT 
NEWS IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET ON 
THE HOUSING LADDER IF YOU ARE A 
HOMEOWNER WHO CAN REMEMBER THE DAYS 
OF NEGATIVE EQUITY YOU COULD BE 
FEELING ANXIOUS 
MOST OF US AVOID 
THE PAIN OF RISING MONTHLY MORTGAGE 
PAYMENTS BY FIXING THE RATE OF OUR 
HOME LOAN WHAT ABOUT TAKING OUT A 
TWENTY FIVE YEAR FIXED RATE 
TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
FIXED FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS DOM LITTLEWOOD 
HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE PROS AND 
CONS FOR US 
CHOOSING A MORTGAGE IS LIKE SWINGS 
AND ROUNDABOUTS IN AMERICA AND 
MOST OF EUROPE LONG TERM FIXED RATE 
MORTGAGES ARE MORE COMMON THAN THEY 
ARE HERE BUT THAT COULD BE ABOUT 
TO CHANGE THE CHANCELLOR WANTS TO 
BRING MORE STABILITY INTO A 
TURBULENT PROPERTY MARKET AND THAT 
COULD MEAN FOR THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
OUR MORTGAGE REPAYMENTS WOULD NEVER 
EVER GO UP SOME MIGHT SAY SAFE AS 
HOUSES A LONG TERM FIXED WOULD BE 
GREAT IF MORTGAGE RATES WENT UP TO 
FIFTEEN PER CENT LIKE THEY DID IN THE LATE EIGHTIES 
NOT SO GREAT IF THEY GO DOWN TO 
THREE POINT FIVE PER CENT LIKE THEY WERE FIVE YEARS AGO 
IT REALLY IS A GAMBLE WOULD YOU 
CONSIDER TAKING OUT A TWENTY FIVE YEAR 
FIXED RATE MORTGAGE 
YES BECAUSE 
IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS YOU ARE GOING TO LOOK 
TO CHANGE YOUR RATE TWELVE TIMES AND 
THEN YOU HAVE ALL THE COSTS OF THAT 
I WOULDN'T BE HAPPY IF THEY WENT 
RIGHT BACK DOWN TO THE FLOOR AGAIN 
AND I AM PAYING THREE HUNDRED MORE MONTH 
JOANNE AND VERNON HAVE TAKEN OUT A 
TWENTY FIVE YEAR MORTGAGE THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND LOAN 
IS COSTING THEM ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED A MONTH AT A 
RATE OF FIVE HUNDRED NINETY NINE PER CENT FIXED UNTIL THE YEAR 
TWO THOUSAND THIRTY TWO BY THEN JOSHUA WILL BE TWENTY NINE 
AND THE NEW ARRIVAL TWENTY FIVE YOU ARE A 
FINANCE MANAGER AND YOU CHOSE TWENTY FIVE 
YEAR FIXED RATE MORTGAGE DEAL WHY 
WAS THAT 
OUR CURRENT MORTGAGE TWO 
YEAR FIXED RATE WAS COMING TO AN 
END AND WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO 
HAVE A LOFT CONVERSION TO PUT AN 
EXTRA BEDROOM INTO THE HOUSE AND 
THAT A TWENTY FIVE YEAR FIXED SEEMED THE 
BEST WAY FORWARD 
IF YOU DECIDE TO 
LEAVE IN THE FIRST TEN YEARS JUMP 
SHIP AND GO TO ANOTHER LENDER 
THERE'S SEVERE PENALTIES 
YES IF 
WE OPT OUT WITHIN THE FIRST FIVE 
YEARS WE HAVE A SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PENALTY UP 
TO THE FIVE TEN YEAR BRACKET IS 
FIVE THOUSAND 
A LOT OF MORTGAGE LENDERS FIVE THOUSAND HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY RELUCTANT TO 
OFFER TWENTY FIVE YEAR FIXES WHAT ABOUT 
NOW KATIE TUCKER IS A SPECIALIST 
ADVISER WHAT ARE THE PROS AND 
CONS 
IF THEY DO MOVE HOUSE THEY CONS WILL HAVE TO BORROW EXTRA MONEY 
FROM THE SAME LENDER AND THEY WILL 
ONLY HAVE THE CHOICE OF THE 
INTEREST RATE THAT THE LENDER IS 
WILLING TO OFFER THEM THAT COULD 
BE A LOT HIGHER THAN THEY WOULD GET 
SOMEWHERE ELSE THE OTHER THING TO 
LOOK OUT FOR WITH TWENTY FIVE YEAR OR ANY 
LONG TERM FIXED MORTGAGE IS THE 
PORTABILITY TERMS AND CONDITIONS A 
LOT OF LENDERS WILL SELL YOU A TWENTY FIVE 
YEAR MORTGAGE SAYING IT IS 
PORTABLE YOU CAN MOVE IT TO 
ANOTHER HOUSE HOWEVER WHEN IT 
COMES TO PORTING IT WHAT A LOT OF 
PEOPLE DON'T REALISE IS THE LENDER 
WILL GO THROUGH A WHOLE MORTGAGE 
APPLICATION WITH YOU AGAIN AND 
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T FIT THE BILL 
IF YOU ARE ONE INCOME DOWN AND YOU 
HAVE GONE SELF EMPLOYED FOR EXAMPLE 
KATIE CALCULATES IF INTEREST RATES 
FOLLOW A SIMILAR PATTERN TO THE 
LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE FAMILY WILL BE 
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND BETTER OFF DON'T FORGET 
RATES CAN GO DOWN AS WELL AS UP TWENTY FIVE 
YEARS IS LONG LONG TIME ANY WORRIES 
NO WHAT WE NEEDED TO HAVE WORRIES IS ADDED SECURITY THAT INTEREST 
RATES WEREN'T GOING TO INCREASE AND 
WE KNEW WHAT WE WERE PAYING ON A 
MONTHLY BASIS IF THEY WERE TO GO 
DOWN SO WHAT WE HAVE PEACE OF 
MIND 
THAT IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT MIND BEFORE WE GET INTO SOME DETAILS 
ALAN YOU HAVE OWNED HOMES HERE AND 
IN THE STATES IS EVERYONE AS 
BORING ABOUT HOUSE PRICES AND 
TALKING ABOUT MORTGAGES OVER THERE 
ALL THE TIME 
THIS IS THE FIRST 
TIME I'VE HAD TO TALK ABOUT IT ON A 
TALKSHOW SO THE ANSWER WOULD BE 
NO EVERYONE SAYS IT IS NOT GOING 
TO LAST LONG 
THE MARKET IS ABOUT 
TO CRASH 
THEY ALWAYS SAY THAT L. I THOUGHT AMERICANS SAY THINGS ARE 
GOING TO GO GREAT YOUR VIEW 
PAULA ON THESE TWENTY FIVE YEAR MORTGAGES I 
ASSUME YOU ARE AGAINST THEM BECAUSE 
WHO IS GOING TO BUY YOUR MAGAZINE 
IF PEOPLE AREN'T CHOPPING AND 
CHANGING MORTGAGES ALL THE TIME 
THERE IS NOT LOT OF DEMAND FOR 
THEM WE NEVER HAVE WANTED TO 
COMMIT FOR THAT LONG IT IS QUITE 
TRUE TO SAY FIFTEEN YEAR FIXED RATES ARE 
FAR MORE COMMON THAN THEY ARE HERE 
THAT IS BECAUSE THAT WAS ALL 
AVAILABLE THEY HAVE BEEN AROUND 
FOR A LONG TIME THERE ISN'T THE 
DEMAND DESPITE WHAT GORDON BROWN 
SAYS HE MIGHT US ALL WANT TO FIX 
FOREVER BUT LENDERS AREN'T GOING 
TO INTRODUCE THESE PRODUCTS BECAUSE 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS TOLD THEM TOO 
WHO DO YOU RECOMMEND THEM FOR ALL ALL FIXED RATES ARE A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE 
THEY GIVE YOU SECURITY AND PEACE OF 
MIND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IS COMING 
OUT OF YOUR ACCOUNT IF YOU ARE A 
SECURITY FREAK A TWENTY FIVE YEAR FIXED 
RATE YOU NEVER HAVE TO THINK ABOUT 
IT AGAIN NOT CALLING EVERYONE OUT 
THERE A FREAK 
YES YOU ARE YOU YOU NEVER HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN 
IF YOU HATE THE WHOLE SUBJECT THAT 
IS FINE 
DO YOU WANT ONE 
IF I 
NEVER HAD TO TALK ABOUT MORTGAGES 
AGAIN I WOULD 
IT IS MY ONLY TOPIC OF CONVERSATION 
THANKS ALAN YOU CONVERSATION MOVED TO THE STATES BUT I AM GLAD 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANY THIN RESEMBLING 
A TRANSATLANTIC ACCENT 
YES INDEED 
I HATE THOSE PEOPLE WHO GO LIKE 
THAT AND THEY GO AND L. WENT TO

NINETEEN SIXTY ONE ANDY STUART OF DONALD WHERE'S 
YOUR TROUSERS REMEMBER HIM ALAN 
OF COURSE I REMEMBER 
HE HAD 
ANOTHER SONG A SCOTTISH SOLDIER IN 
THE U. K. CHARTS FOR NINE MONTHS 
MYLEENE KLASS VECTS THE STORY 
BEHIND THE SONG AND FINDS IT MAY 
AUDLEY HAVE MEDITERRANEAN ROOTS 
THERE WAS A SOLDIER A SCOTTISH 
SOLDIER SOLDIER WHO WONDERED FAR AWAY AND 
SOLDIERED FAR AWAY 
THERE WAS NONE BOLDER WITH GOOD 
BROAD SHOULDER 
IN THE NINETEEN SIXTY ANDY STUART WAS IN THE 
CHARTS FOR THIRTY SIX WEEKS WITH SCOTTISH 
SOLDIER IT BECAME PART OF POPULAR 
SCOTTISH CULTURE CULTURE AND IS 
STILL A PARTICULAR FAVOURITE WITH 
PIPERS 
THE SONG'S IMAGE OF A DYING SOLDIER 
LONGING FOR THE HILLS OF SCOTLAND 
HAS REMAINED POWERFUL 
THIS IS A 
SONG ABOUT A MAN WHO BELONGS TO A 
REGIMENT WHO GOES OFF TO FIGHT IN 
ONE OF BRITAIN'S IMPERIAL WARS 
DIES FAR FROM HOME AND AS HE'S 
DYING HE REMEMBERS THOSE WONDERFUL 
HILLS OF HIS CHILDHOOD THE HILLS 
OF HOME 
DO YOU THINK IT IS 
ROMANTICISED THE SCOTTISH SOLDIER 
IT'S ROMANTCISM RUN RIOT AND WHEN 
IT CAME OUT IN THE EARLY PART OF 
THE NINETEEN SIXTIES THE BRITISH PUBLIC 
LAPPED IT UP 
THEY ARE NOT THE HILLS OF HOME 
BUT THE TUNE FOR THIS SONG IS FAR 
OLDER THAN THE WORDS IT'S PART OF 
THE HISTORY OF THE NINETY THIRD SOUTHER 
LAND HIGHLANDERS WHO IS MUSEUM IS 
HERE IN STIRLING CASTLE WHERE DID 
THIS TUNE ORIGINATE FROM 
IT HAD 
ITS ORIGINS IN THE CRY ME AN ANWAR 
ONE NIGHT THE MILL MILITARY BABED 
WAS PLAYING A SELECTION OF TUNES 
FROM WILLIAM TELL AND AMONGST THEM 
WAS A VERY EVOCKTIVE TUNE AND IT 
WAS HEARD BY PIPE MAJOR JOHN 
MACLEOD OF THE NINETY THIRD HIGHLANDERS HE 
DECIDED TO ADAPT IT FOR THE PIPES 
AND SO THE GREEN HILLS OF TYROL 
CAME INTO BEING 
WHY DO YOU THINK 
IT WORKED SO WELL AS A MILITARY 
TUNE 
THE PIPES GIVE IT AN TUNE INCREDIBLE SENSE OF DEPTH BRING IN 
THE DRUMS AND YOU HAVE A PERFECT 
PIECE OF MILITARY MUSIC 
IF THINGS ARE GOING WRONG IF THE 
ENEMY IS PRESSING PLAYING 
SOMETHING LIKE THE REGIMENTAL 
CHARGE CAN HAVE A TREMENDOUS EFFECT 
ON MEN'S SPIRITS BECAUSE IT REMINDS 
THEM THAT THEY AREN'T JUST SOLDIERS 
THEY ARE SOUTHER LAND HIGHLANDERS 
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE 
STORY OF THE THIN RED LINE NOT 
MANY PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH IT 
THE RUSSIAN CAVALRY WERE ATTACKING 
THE BRITISH SUPPLY BASE ALL THAT 
STOOD BETWEEN THEM AND SUCCESS WAS 
THIS DETACHMENT OF THE NINETY THIRD 
HIGHLANDERS THE COMMANDER GIVES 
THIS ORDER TO THE NINETY THIRD HIGHLANDERS 
REMEMBER MEN THERE IS NO ESCAPE 
FROM HERE YOU MUST DIE WHERE YOU 
STAND AND THE HIGHLANDERS SAID 
YES IF NEEDS BE WE WILL DO JUST 
THAT FORTUNATELY THEY MANAGED TO 
WIN THE DAY AND SO THE NOTION OF 
THE THIN RED LINE CAME INTO BEING 
TO TRY ANY ACTION IN WHICH BRITISH 
SOLDIERS SHOWED TREMENDOUS COURAGE 
AGAINST OVERWHELMING ODDS WE STILL 
USE IT TODAY 
SO IT IS A CLASSICAL 
TUNE PICKED UP FROM THE SAR DINIAN 
BAND DURING A WAR AND YET SOME HOW 
IT NOW NOW BELONGS TO SCOTLAND 
THAT'S IT FOR TONIGHT TOMORROW WE 
ARE JOINED BY STEPHENBERG OFF AND 
WE TAKE A LOOK AT A BIRD THAT THAT 
DOES AN IMPRESSION OF A CHAIN SAW 
YOU WOULD LIKE TO COME BACK FOR 
THAT 
I CAN'T WAIT THAT WE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALAN AND THANK 
YOU EVERYBODY AS WELL WE LEAVE YOU 
TONIGHT IN THIS HORRIBLE EVENING 
WITH SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW 
WITH THE WIZARD IN MIND WE HAVE A 
SCOTSMAN HERE WE ARE GOING TO PLAY 
IT ON THE BAGPIPES 
ALISTAIR SMITH 
JUST TALK TO US 
IF I TELL THE WORLD 
I'LL NEVER SAY ENOUGH 
COS IT WAS NOT SAID TO YOU 
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED TO DO 
IF I END UP WITH YOU 
TALK 
HOLBY BLUE BEING A GOOD COP IS JUST THE HALF OF IT
