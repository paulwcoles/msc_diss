GAINED AT READING BUT READING 
LOSING AT ARSENAL AND BOLTON ONE UP 
AT MIDDLESBROUGH IT IS IMPORTANT

IF BARNSLEY WHEN THEY ARE SAFE 
LEICESTER'S DEFENDERS ARE MAINLY 
THE HEROES HERE BUT THE HEADLINE 
GRABBER FOR THE SECOND WEEK RUNNING 
IS IAN HUME A LATE EQUALISER 
AGAINST SHOT COLCHESTER LAST WEEK 
A POSSIBLE CRUCIAL WHEN THEY HEAR 
POACHED FROM CLOSE RANGE HIS TENTH

RESULT OF THEIR POOR FINISHING 
LEICESTER OUT OF TROUBLE JUST

SEASON AS THE M. K. DONS SKIPPER HE 
HAS LED FROM THE FRONT AND IT IS 
FITTING THAT HE SCORED CONFIRMING 
NOT ONLY THEIR PROMOTION BUT THEIR 
CHAMPIONSHIP HE KICKED WITH A REAL 
QUALITY PAST THE STOCKPORT KEEPER

FULHAM PLAYERS HAVE NOT GIVEN UP 
DANNY MURPHY HAD A SHOT THAT WAS 
WELL SAVED BUT THE FANS ARE SEEN

BOLTON ON THEIR WAY OUT OF THE 
RELEGATION PLACES 
MIDDLESBROUGH ZERO 
BOLTON ONE BOLTON HANGING ON AND 
THEIR GOAL CAME JUST ON THE HOUR 
AFTER GAVIN MCCANN HAD HANDLED IN 
HIS OWN AREA THE PENALTY APPEAL 
WAS TURNED DOWN PLAY SWITCHED TO 
THE OTHER END BOLTON HAD AND 
PENALTY TURNED DOWN MIDDLESBROUGH 
COULD NOT DEAL AT A CORNER AND 
GAVIN MCCANN FORCED IT OVER FROM 
CLOSE RANGE 
BIRMINGHAM UNDER 
PRESSURE PLAYING ASTON VILLA 
TOMORROW READ IN A SERIOUSLY UNDER 
PRESSURE LOSING TO ARSENAL AT 
LUNCHTIME WIGAN AGAINST TOTTENHAM 
ONE TO ONE BOTH SIDES HAVE MADE CHANGES 
UP FRONT DARREN BENT IS ON FOR 
SPURS FOR ROBBIE KEANE SIBIERSKI 
FOUR HESKEY WIGAN WERE PRESSING 
ANTOINE SIBIERSKI HAS HAD VERY 
GOOD CHANCE TO SCORE HE SCREWED 
HIS VOLLEY WIDE NOT EASY BUT HE 
HAS PUT THOSE AWAY BEFORE IT COULD 
BE A VERY NERVOUS LAST FEW MINUTES 
FOR THE HOME FANS 
UPTON PARK ARE 
WEST HAM FANS BEING ENTERTAINED WAR 
ENCOURAGED BY THEIR TEAM'S 
PERFORMANCE AGAINST RELEGATED 
DERBY 
THEY 
ARE RELIEVED THAT THEY DERBY ARE NOT GOING TO BE ON THE END OF 
DERBY'S FIRST AWAY WIN OF THE 
SEASON THAT GOAL FROM CARLTON COLE 
TO PUT THEM TWO TO ONE AHEAD THE GOAL HAS 
GONE A LITTLE DEAD WEST HAM HAVE 
BROUGHT ON THE SUBSTITUTES' TO TRY 
TO SLOW THE GAME DOWN ROY CARROLL 
MAKES A FINE SAVE WEST HAM ARE 
JUST SEEING THIS ONE OUT FOR HAVING 
LOST THE LAST THREE GAMES THAT WAS 
A VITAL FIXTURE FOR WEST HAM WHAT WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THEM 
POSSIBLY LOSING TODAY 
FIRST AND 
FOREMOST THEY ARE WINNING BUT AT 
ONE TO ONE I WAS WATCHING THE MONITOR 
YOU COULD SEE THAT THE FANS WERE 
GETTING VERY IRRITATED IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN AN EMBARRASSING DRAW AND 
THEIR WORST DEFEAT IF THEY HAVE 
LOST IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT 
TO BUT ALAN CURBISHLEY'S MANAGEMENT 
UNDER SERIOUS PRESSURE 
WHAT IS 
YOUR READING OF THE FULHAM AND 
BOLTON SITUATION DIFFICULT TO SEE 
A WAY BACK FOR FOUR 
IT IS 
BOLTON HAVE DONE THEMSELVES A 
MASSIVE FAVOUR NOT ONLY DO A LOOK 
LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO GET A RESULT 
BUT THEY HAVE PLAYED WELL IN THE 
SECOND HALF LIVERPOOL MADE EIGHT 
CHANGES AT HOME YOU NEED TO PUT 
LIVERPOOL UNDER PRESSURE WITH THE 
CHANGES THEY HAVE MADE THEY HAVE 
NOT DONE THAT IT HAS BEEN A STROLL 
IN THE PARK FOR LIVERPOOL 
AS FAR 
AS RELEGATION IS CONCERNED BOLTON 
WILL NOW HAVE MOMENTUM IF THEY CAN 
WIN THIS GAME 
POLL YOURSELF OUT OF 
THE BOTTOM THREE FULHAM GOT THE 
WIN AWAY AT READING BUT THEY 
CANNOT BACK IT UP AGAINST LIVERPOOL 
THAT IS WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO 
EVERYONE ABOVE THEM IS THINKING 
THEY ARE DEFINITELY IN THE NEXT 
BOLTON READING BIRMINGHAM L. L. FEEL 
SUNDERLAND LAST SAVE L. THOUGHT 
MIDDLESBROUGH WOULD HAVE WON TODAY 
I FELT STRONGLY FOR MIDDLESBROUGH 
BUT IN THE SECOND HALF THEY PLAYED 
WELL DERBY HAVE GIVEN WEST HAM A 
SCARE AS WELL 
MANSFIELD THREE 
SHREWSBURY ONE A LATE GOAL FOR 
MANSFIELD COULD MAKE SURE THEY HAVE 
A CHANCE OF STAYING IN THE FOOTBALL 
LEAGUE A KICK OFF SECOND BOTTOM 
AND FOUR POINTS FROM SAFETY THEY 
PLAY DAGENHAM AND AMP REDBRIDGE IN THE 
FINAL GAME OF THE SEASON A VITAL 
THREE POINTS AS THEY ATTEMPT TO 
STAY IN THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE AND 
EXTEND THEIR STINT CONGRATULATIONS 
TO HAMILTON THEY ARE PLAYING QUITE 
THIS AFTERNOON ON THEIR WAY INTO 
THE S. P. L. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NINETEEN 
YEARS I THINK IT IS 
THAT IS RIGHT 
IT HAS TAKEN AND NINETEEN YEARS BUT 
HAMILTON ACADEMICALS ARE BACK IN 
THE TOP FLIGHT THEY HAVE LESS 
DIVISION ONE FROM START TO FINISH 
AND FEW WILL DENY THEM THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP THEY HAVE NOT LOST 
ALL SEASON ON A PLASTIC PITCH WILL 
NOW BE REPLACED AT GRASS OVER THE 
SUMMER STEVENSON AND OFFIONG ON 
TARGET A FINE EFFORT ALL SIDE BY 
THE HOME TEAM AND NEXT SEASON IT 
WILL BE CELTIC AND RANGERS VISITING 
RATHER THAN CLYDE AND MORTON 
HAMILTON TO PROMOTED TO BE S. P. L. 
CONGRATULATIONS TO HAMILTON CELTIC 
ARE GOING BACK TO THE TOP OF THE 
S. P. L. ALTHOUGH RANGERS HAVE PLENTY 
OF GAMES IN HAND 
THEY ARE AT THE 
SCORELINE STAYS THIS WAY WE ARE IN 
THE FIRST OF THREE MINUTES OF 
STOPPAGE TIME SAMARAS WITH THE 
ONLY GAME OF THE ONLY GOAL OF THE 
GAME ON TWO OCCASIONS HE HAS HAD 
THE BALL IN THE BACK OF THE NET 
ONLY FOR THE FLIGHT TO BE RAISED 
FOR OFFSIDE DEEP INTO STOPPAGE 
TIME NOW 
THREE GAMES IN HAND FOR 
RANGERS DE CHAMPIONSHIP WEST 
BROMWICH ALBION AGAINST NORWICH 
CITY 
PRESSURE FROM NORWICH MAKING CITY THIS LESS COMFORTABLE FOR WEST HAM 
BUT THEY LEAD BY TWO TO ZERO SALT 
AND ERA MAKING THE DIFFERENCE THEY 
ARE ON COURSE FOR THREE PINTS AND 
VERY POSSIBLY A PLACE BACK IN THE 
TOP DIVISION 
A ALBION ON THE 
THRESHOLD OF PROMOTION HULL LANE 
SHEFFIELD UNITED HAVE NOT GIVEN UP 
ON THE PLAY OFFS 
VERY MUCH AND 
CALLS TODAY THEY LEAD TWO TO ZERO GOALS 
FROM QUINN AND BEATTIE HIS TWENTY SECOND OF 
THE SEASON HULL CITY ARE TRIED TO 
REACH THE TOP FLIGHT FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN ONE HUNDRED FOUR YEARS BUT HAVE JOKED 
THAT THE LAST MINUTE THEY HAVE NOT 
PLAYED WELL ALL DAY AND ARE 
TRAILING TWO TO ZERO THAT IS HOW IT IS 
WITH A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO GO 
STOKE AGAINST BRISTOL CITY KICKS 
OFF AT FIVE TWENTY P. M. WATFORD AGAINST 
CRYSTAL PALACE WATFORD'S CHANCES 
OF AUTOMATIC PROMOTION ARE ALMOST 
GONE 
IT IS STILL WATFORD ZERO GONE CRYSTAL PALACE TWO THAT BACK IN LATE 
TWENTY FIRST OCTOBER POINTS SEPARATED THE 
SIDES IF THE SCORE LINE STAYS THE 
SAME THE GAP WILL BE DOWN TO JUST 
ONE IFIL AND MOSES DID THE DAMAGE 
WHICH COULD REINFORCE PALACE'S 
PLAY OFF PROSPECTS 
A GOAL IN A 
MATCH BETWEEN COLCHESTER AND 
COVENTRY NEIL HENDERSON 
FIVE TO ONE NOW 
A SECOND PENALTY OF THE GAME WARD 
WITH HIS SECOND OF THE GAME FIVE TO ONE 
AFTER DAN BROUGHT HIM DOWN INSIDE 
THE AREA COVENTRY ARE FULL OF 
CONFIDENCE NOW TWO KEY GAMES 
COMING UP AND IF THEY WIN THOSE 
THEY MIGHT JUST SURVIVE THE THE WHISTLE HAS GONE AT CRAVEN COTTAGE 
FOUR HAVE AVERAGED TWELFTH IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE CUP LAST SIX SEASONS 
BUT IT WILL TAKE A MIRACLE TO SEE 
THEM THEN NEXT SEASON FULHAM 
TABLOID HEADLINES FOR ALL THE WRONG 
REASONS HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN BY THE 
TRAVELLING LIVERPOOL FANS IF ONLY 
THE HOME SUPPORTERS' WORRIES COULD 
BE PAPERED OVER WITH WORLD CLASS 
PLAYERS JERMAINE PENNANT SMASHED A 
RIGHT FOOT SHOT PAST KASEY KELLER 
TO COME AND UNFAMILIAR LIVERPOOL 
LINE UP IN THE SECOND HALF THE 
FANS WERE FULL OF CHATTER ABOUT 
AWAY DAYS AT BARNSLEY BUT KELLER 
COULD HAVE SAVED THE SECOND GOAL 
FANS LEFT WELL BEFORE THE FINAL 
WHISTLE 
THEY CHAMPIONS THE SEMI WHISTLE FINAL ON THE WAY FOR LIVERPOOL 
JUST ABOUT FOURTH PLACE CONFIRMED NOW 
THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI FINAL 
THIS WAS CASE OF WIGAN GRETAR 
AGAINST THE STYLE AND SWAGGER OF A 
SIDE WHO TOOK THE LEAD EARLY 
ON THROUGH DIMITAR BERBATOV HESKEY 
EQUALISED FOR WIGAN TO SEND THEIR 
LEVEL AT THE BREAK AND IT WAS THE 
HOME SIDE TOOK IT ON MARCUS BENT 
HITTING THE BAR WHEN HE SHOULD 
OUTSCORED SIBIERSKI AND PALIOS HAD 
CHANCES TO WIN FOR THE THE LATICS 
BUT THEY WILL BE HAPPY WITH A 
DESERVED POINT MACRO 
IF CARDIFF AT 
WON TODAY AND WON A GAME IN HAND 
THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A CHANCE THE 
SCUNTHORPE ALREADY RELEGATED MAY 
HAVE SWATCH DAY WHEN LATE IN THE 
GAME THREE TO TWO FINAL WHISTLES ARE GOING 
SCHOLES STILL BEING SCORED BUT IT 
FASTER STILL AND WITH A CHANCE OF 
WINNING THE 
SWINDON SIX RELEGATED PORT VALE ZERO

REAL SCRAP THEY DOMINATED A POOR 
FIRST HALF SOME MORE SCORING FROM 
A HEADER ZAMORA DERBY FAN BASE 
BACK IN THE SECOND PERIOD AND A 
GOAL AS WELL FROM TYRONE MEARS AS 
UPTON PARK GROWLED JUST WHEN IT 
LOOKED LIKE DERBY FANS WERE 
BEGINNING TO DREAM OF AN AWAY WIN 
CARLTON COLE HAMMERED IN A WINNER 
DERBY STILL HAD CHANCES A RELIEF 
FOR ALAN CURBISHLEY SAME OLD STORY 
FOR ALREADY RELEGATED DERBY CREWE CREWE HAVE GIVEN THEMSELVES A CHANCE OF

CLOSES THE DOOR ON SEVERAL CLUBS AS 
FAR AS THE PLAY OFFS ARE CONCERNED 
CRYSTAL PALACE HAVE A TERRIFIC 
RECORD IN THE PLAY OFFS AND IT

TEN MEN AFTER MORGAN WAS SENT OFF A 
FINE GOAL FOR STEPHEN QUINN WITH A 
LOVELY BALI AND JAMES BEATTIE WITH 
A PENALTY HIS TWENTY SECOND OF THE SEASON 
HULL NEVER REALLY IN THE GAME AND 
WHEN WAYNE BROWN WAS DECLARED UNFIT 
AT THE START OF THE GAME THEY ARE 
ROCK SOLID ANCHOR IN DEFENCE IT 
DID LOOK BAD FOR THE TIGERS AND IT 
REMAINS THAT WAY UNTIL THE END 
MIDDLESBROUGH AGAINST BOLTON A 
FAMOUS VICTORY FOR BOLTON STEVE 
SUTTON 
YES INDEED GAVIN MCCANN SUTTON ON THE HOUR FOR BOLTON COULD THAT 
BE A LIFE SAVING GOAL FOR THEM 
THEY ARE OUT OF THE BOTTOM THREE 
TONIGHT AS A RESULT OF THOSE THREE 
POINTS BUT IF YOU HAD SEEN THE 
OPENING TEN MINUTES YOU WOULD NOT 
HAVE THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE 
MIDDLESBROUGH HAD BOLTON REDUCED TO 
HEADLESS CHICKENS THREE TIMES THE 
TURNING POINT ON THE HOUR GAVIN 
MCCANN HANDLING IN HIS OWN AREA 
MIDDLESBROUGH DENIED A PENALTY THE 
GAMES WHICH TO THE OTHER END PORT 
AND DENIED A PENALTY THE BALL WENT 
FOR A CORNER AND GAVIN MCCANN POKE

KICKS OFF IN FEW MINUTES 
BLACKBURN UNCHANGED THE SAME ELEVEN 
STARTED LAST WEEK AT LIVERPOOL BUT 
FOUR CHANGES FOR MANCHESTER UNITED 
GOALKEEPER VAN DER SAR AND OWEN 
HARGREAVES HAVE SLIGHT KNOCKS SO 
THEY ARE NOT RISK AHEAD OF 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE DUTY GOOD NEWS 
FOR UNITED FANS IN THE RETURN AFTER 
THREE GAMES OUT OF NEMANJA VIDIC 
AND CARLOS TEVEZ STARTS TOO TO 
ANOTHER ROONEY AND SCHOLES ALL 
START FAIR TO SAY IT IS UNITED'S 
STRONGEST AVAILABLE LINE UP 
HIGHLIGHTS OF ALL TODAY'S BARCLAYS 
PREMIER LEAGUE GAMES ARE ON TONIGHT 
NOW WELL PLAYED BOLTON WANDERERS 
FIRST WIN IN ELEVEN LAST SATURDAY THEY 
WON AGAIN AGAIN TODAY AGAINST 
MIDDLESBROUGH AND BOLTON ARE OUT 
OF THE BOTTOM THREE LET'S HEAR 
FROM THEIR MANAGER 
THERE WERE MANY 
ASPECTS OF TODAY THAT PLEASED YOU 
I GUESS BUT THEY DID PLAY FOR YOU 
TODAY DIDN'T THEY 
WE HAVE DONE IT 
ALL THE TIME LET OURSELVES DOWN IN 
TERMS OF TECHNIQUE ONCE OR TWICE 
BUT WE HAVE NEVER ONCE HAD TO 
CRITICISE THE HONESTY AND INTEGRITY 
AND EFFORT AND WORK THEY HAVE PUT 
IN TODAY WAS NOT A CLASSIC BY ANY 
MEANS WE SET OFF POORLY PROBABLY 
FORTUNATE TO COME IN AT HALF TIME 
AT ZERO TO ZERO BUT THE SECOND HALF WE 
PLAYED HOW WE NORMALLY PLAY AT THE 
REEBOK AND GOT A DECENT RESULT IT 
WAS PROBABLY THE CLASSIC CASE OF A 
GAME OF TWO HALVES 
I AFTER THE 
START AND MIDDLESBROUGH HAD 
THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT SAVES EARLY 
ON 
THERE WERE WE WERE FORTUNATE ON TO BE IN IT WHEN I SAY FORTUNATE 
IT IS NOT ALWAYS FORTUNATE IF YOU 
HAVE A GOALKEEPER OF THE CASE OF 
ANNELIE WHO HAS MADE TWO OR THREE 
REALLY GOOD SAVE THAT KEPT US IN IT 
ALI IT OBVIOUSLY CHANGES THE 
GAME WE HAVE TO COME OUT AND PLAY 
IN A MORE FLUID WAY BUT HE HAS 
MADE THOSE SAVES AND IT IS NOT A 
SURPRISE TO US THAT IS TWO CLEAN 
SHEETS HE HAS HAD 
BOLTON ARE OUT 
OF THE BOTTOM THREE 
AND THE TEAM CAME OUT AT EWOOD PARK 
FOR THE BLACKBURN UNITED VERSUS 
MANCHESTER UNITED GAME THAT WILL 
SUPPLY THE NEXT CHAPTER IN THE 
TITLE RACE IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN 
GARTH 
IT WILL BE ANOTHER TWIST IN GARTH IT TERROR THEY ALL WANT BLACKBURN 
TO FRIGHTEN MANCHESTER UNITED TO 
DEATH AND PROVIDE A LIFELINE THEY THEY HAVE A GOOD RECORD MANCHESTER MANCHESTER UNITED HAVE WON ONCE IN SEVEN 
ATTEMPTS THEY HAVE THEIR STRONGEST 
LINE UP I THINK THERE WILL BE A 
LITTLE TWIST HOPE FOR THE 
BLACKBURN CAN PROVIDE IT 
AND LES 
MAN UTD TO LOSE THINK BLACKBURN 
WILL PROVIDE TOUGH OPPOSITION BUT 
THEY HAVE GONE WITH THE STRONGEST 
LINE UP THEY CAN 
I HAVE JUST HEARD 
FROM GARY MEGSON THE BOLTON 
MANAGER THEY HAVE MOMENTUM NOW 
THEY ARE OUT OF THE RELEGATION 
PLACES READING AND BIRMINGHAM MUST 
BE SCARED STIFF 
IT WAS A BIG CALL 
TODAY THEY HAD TO WIN THE GOAL 
WAS SENSATIONAL TODAY THEY NEED TO 
LOOK TO THAT GOALKEEPER 
THEY HAVE 
HIT FORM AT THE RIGHT TIME 
BACK TO 
BACK WINS FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS 
SEASON THE WINNER HAS SCORED SEVEN 
OR EIGHT GOALS BEFORE BUT ONE TO ZERO ONE TO ZERO 
IS ENOUGH TO GET THEM OUT OF THE 
BOTTOM THREE 
THE OF THE GAMES THEY 
HAVE LEFT CAN YOU SEE THEM 
COMPLETING WHAT WOULD BE A 
REMARKABLE SALVAGE OPERATION AT AT THE MOMENT YES BECAUSE TO A MAN 
THEY GAVE THEIR ALL EL HADJI DIOUF 
WAS A GREAT TODAY HE SAID THE 
FIRST HALF BUT THEY WENT ON FROM 
THERE AND TOOK THE GAME TO 
MIDDLESBROUGH 
THIRTY SIX POINTS IS THE MIDDLESBROUGH MAGIC NUMBER 
A POOR FINISH FOR 
FULHAM 
THEY HAVE TO WIN ALL THEIR FULHAM GAMES INCLUDING PORTSMOUTH AWAY 
BIRMINGHAM AT HOME AND MAN CITY 
AWAY THEY HAVE NO CHANCE 
WHEN YOU 
CONSIDER THEY HAVE ONLY HAD ONE 
GAME AWAY FROM HOME ALL SEASON 
IT IS AS SIMPLE AS THAT THEY HAVE 
ONLY WON ONE IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AWAY FROM 
HOME 
WE HAVE MENTIONED BIRMINGHAM HOME AND READING FEELING UNDER PRESSURE 
LOOK AT BIRMINGHAM'S GAMES AND 
THEN A HOME GAME AT BLACKBURN CAN 
YOU SEE THEM WINNING THAT ONE IT IT WILL BE A BIG GAME IF THEY CAN GET 
SOMETHING AGAINST VILLA WHO KNOWS 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN AT HOME AGAINST 
LIVERPOOL 
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING IN LIVERPOOL READING'S PERFORMANCE AT THE 
CAMERAS TO GIVE THEIR FANS 
ENCOURAGEMENT THAT THEY CAN STAGE A 
COMEBACK 
IN THE SECOND HALF YES COMEBACK THE FIRST HALF NO WIGAN WILL BE 
THE CRUNCH GAME FOR THEM 
WIGAN ARE 
ON THIRTY SIX POINTS THEY MIGHT THINK THEY 
HAVE THE MAGIC NUMBER TO STAY UP 
IF THEY RELAX IT MIGHT GIVE 
READING A LIFELINE A WIN COULD PUT 
THEM RIGHT BACK IN THE PICTURE I I SAW STEVE COPPELL'S INTERVIEW AT 
THE END OF THE GAME HE SAID HE HAS 
TWO TEAMS OF ELEVEN AND HE DOES NOT 
KNOW WHAT HIS BEST TEAM IS AFTER 
TODAY I DO NOT KNOW WHICH ONE OF 
THOSE ELEVEN PLAYERS WILL PLAY NEXT 
WEEK 
THINGS ARE GETTING DECIDED WEEK WEST BROMWICH ALBION WILL BE BACK 
IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE WE THINK IN 
LEAGUE TWO M. K. DONS AND 
PETERBOROUGH PROMOTED 
CONGRATULATIONS TO THEM 
ONE OF THE 
RESULTS OF THE DAY L. WOULD PUT 
THAT WITH BOLTON PROBABLY CRYSTAL 
PALACE AWAY AT WATFORD 
I SAW THEM 
IN THE JOHNSONS TROPHY EXCELLENT 
FOOTBALL CONGRATULATIONS TO PAUL 
INCE AS WELL 
MANSFIELD AND WREXHAM

TOO MUCH FOR WREXHAM WHATEVER WHATEVER LEVEL YOU PLAY OUT IT DOES NOT 
MATTER SUNTANS YOU HAVE GOT TO 
PLAY FOR PRIDE
