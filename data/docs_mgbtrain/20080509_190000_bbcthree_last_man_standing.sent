THIS PROGRAMME CONTAINS STRONG LANGUAGE 
SIX YOUNG ATHLETES HAVE ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE OF A LIFETIME 
TO TRAVEL THE WORLD AND COMPETE AGAINST THE MOST REMOTE TRIBES ON EARTH 
ON THEIR OWN TURF 
I AM REALLY BRICKING IT 
OH I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE WE'RE GOING 
ALL SIX MEN ARE MASTERS IN THEIR CHOSEN FIELDS 
COVERING THE HEAVY LIFTING BRAD BRINGS THE BRAWN 
YEAH I'M A STRONGMAN EVERY COMPETITION YOU ARE YOUR ONE MAN ARMY 
OXFORD GRADUATE RICHARD IS ENGLISH GRIT 
I LOVE TO WIN I HATE LOSING 
JASON'S A CHAMPION B. M. X. SPRINTER WHO'S FOUGHT HIS WAY TO THE TOP 
YOU KNOW THEY GOT THE OLD PHRASE CAN'T BEAT 'EM JOIN 'EM 
I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE IN THAT 
CAN'T BEAT 'EM YOU CHEAT 
MARK IS ALL TECHNIQUE 
A SALSA DANCER WITH A PUNCH 
I'M PRETTY GOOD AT EVERYTHING THAT I DO 
COREY'S A HARVARD EDUCATED SCIENTIST 
I'LL USE BRAIN BEFORE MUSCLE 
AND A TOP ENDURANCE ATHLETE 
CONQUERED 
AND RAJKO'S A FITNESS GURU WITH A BODY HONED TO PERFECTION 
I WANT TO ACHIEVE MY OPTIMUM AS A PHYSICAL BEING 
OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS ALL SIX WILL BE PUT THROUGH HELL 
BUT WILL THEIR WESTERN SKILLS COUNT FOR ANYTHING I CAN'T BREATHE 
AS THEY'RE HURLED INTO A WORLD OF TRIBAL SPORT AND RITUAL 
UNLIKE ANYTHING THEY'VE EVER SEEN 
COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BE THE LAST MAN STANDING 
OUR ATHLETES ARE HEADING DEEP INTO THE HEART OF SOUTH AFRICA 
THEY'RE ON THE SECOND LEG OF A CONTEST THAT'S TAKING THEM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
THEIR FIRST CHALLENGE WAS TO FIGHT KALAPALO WARRIORS IN BRAZIL 
IT WAS BRUTAL THREE OF THEM FAILED 
DAMN IT 
MAYBE THEY JUST WANNA KICK OUR ASS 
DEEMED UNWORTHY TO TAKE PART 
THE SURVIVORS WENT THROUGH AN AGONISING BLOODLETTING CEREMONY 
THIS IS REALLY QUITE SERIOUS PAIN ACTUALLY 
WOW 
WHEN IT CAME TO THE FIGHT THINGS DIDN'T GET ANY BETTER 
HE'S GOT A BIG BALD HEAD AND WILD EYES 
ALL THREE WERE DESTROYED 
BUT THE KALAPALO CHIEF EVENTUALLY DECIDED THAT BRAD FOUGHT THE BEST 
THAT'S RIGHT I'M BRAD 
RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T KNOW IT BUT THEY'RE ABOUT TO BE THROWN 
INTO BATTLE AGAIN WITH SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST FEARSOME WARRIORS 
ZULU STICK FIGHTERS 
STICK FIGHTING IS NOT FOR THE TIMID I THINK WE'RE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE 
TO SURVIVE OUR ATHLETES WILL NEED TO CONQUER BUTTOCK PUCKERING FEAR 
IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF ONE OF THE GUYS DID GET REALLY HURT 
IT'LL LEAD RUGBY PLAYER RICHARD TO SEEK STRENGTH FROM A WITCH DOCTOR 
WHILE STRONGMAN BRAD WILL WRESTLE WITH HIS CONSCIENCE 
HOW WILL I PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME 
AND B. M. X. BANDIT JASON WILL BE BRUTALISED IN AN ANCIENT COMING OF AGE TEST 
I KNOW I'M GETTING GOOD AT IT 
BECAUSE IN JUST ONE WEEK THEY'LL BE FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES IN A DEADLY STICK FIGHTING CONTEST 
THEIR HOME WILL BE THE VILLAGE OF NEKWAKWANI 
AND INITIALLY THE LOCALS SEEMED PRETTY FRIENDLY 
BUT THEN OUR ATHLETES SEE WHAT THEY'RE IN FOR 
STICK FIGHTING IS THE TRADITIONAL ZULU WAY OF PRACTISING WAR SKILLS AND SETTLING DISPUTES 
A CLUBLIKE STICK IS USED TO BLUDGEON YOUR OPPONENT INTO SUBMISSION 
WINNING IS SIMPLE KNOCK YOUR OPPONENT OUT COLD FORCE HIM TO SURRENDER OR MAKE HIM BLEED 
THAT'S AN ABSOLUTE MEAT CLEAVER 
THAT'S A HEAVY STICK 
THAT DOESN'T NEED TO HIT YOU HARD TO CUT YOU OPEN 
WE WERE JUST LIKE ABSOLUTELY BRICKING IT 
WE WERE SERIOUSLY SCARED 
PROBABLY ONE OF THE SCARIEST MOMENTS OF MY LIFE 
LOOK HE'S BLEEDING THERE 
IT'S A DANGEROUS SPORT MAN 
REALLY DANGEROUS SPORT 
HE DIDN'T EVEN SEEM TO GET HIT 
IT WAS POURING OUT OF HIS HEAD 
I SAW HIM GET HIT THAT THING'S GONNA BE HEAVY 
YOU GOTTA GO INTO IT KNOWING YOU'RE GONNA GET HURT 
JUST FIST FIGHTING THAT'S NOT NEAR AS BIG OF A DEAL TO ME 
I MEAN I KNOW FOR A FACT 
IF I HIT SOMEONE ACROSS THE FACE 
JUST LIKE ONE GOOD SOLID HIT I WOULD KILL 'EM 
BUT IN MY MIND I WAS THINKING I DON'T WANNA DO IT 
IN JUST ONE WEEK OUR ATHLETES WILL BE FACING THE REGION'S BEST STICK FIGHTERS IN AN OPEN CONTEST 
TO AVOID BEING BEATEN TO A PULP THEY'LL NEED TO SPEND TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY WITH STICK FIGHTING MASTERS 
THIS IS WHAT WE CALL HOME THEN BRAD THIS IS IT 
MARK AND BRAD WILL BE TRAINED BY STICK FIGHTING LEGEND KNO 
NAMED AFTER THE NOISE HIS STICK HAS MADE ON NUMEROUS SKULLS 
WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE STICK FIGHT DO A LOT OF PEOPLE GET HURT OR JUST A FEW 
IT'S BEEN A FEELING OF SHOCK AND SURPRISE REALLY 
I NEVER EXPECTED THE LANDSCAPE TO BE LIKE IT IS 
I NEVER EXPECTED THE WELCOME TO BE AS IT WAS 
AND I TO BE HONEST I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE SPORT 
I KNEW WHAT THE SPORT WAS BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GONNA BE LIKE THAT 
SO IT'S MORE OF A WHOA YOU KNOW 
I THOUGHT THE SHIELDS WOULD BE A LOT BIGGER 
THEY LOOK LIKE LITTLE PLAY TOYS 
I WAS EXPECTING AT LEAST ENOUGH TO COVER YOUR BODY 
BUT YOU GET A LITTLE BABY SHIELD TO COVER YOUR FIST AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL IT IS IS A HAND GUARD 
OTHER THAN THAT YOU'VE GOT TWO STICKS TO PROTECT YOU 
SO YEAH THIS IS A TRIP MAN 
FITNESS GURU RAJKO AND MOUNTAINEER COREY ARE LIVING HALF A MILE AWAY ON THE HILLSIDE 
THEIR HOST IS A STICK FIGHTING CHAMPION SIMPLY CALLED MACHINE 
IT'S LIKE A RIDICULOUSLY DANGEROUS SPORT BECAUSE 
THE STICK IS DESIGNED LIKE IF IT'S GONNA HIT YOU IT'S REALLY GONNA HURT 
IS THIS DINNER OR LIKE A SNACK 
IT'S LIKE A DOUGHNUT MM M. M. 
THE FACT THAT WE'RE WITH ZULUS AND THEN WE'RE GONNA BE FIGHTING STICKS' 
I MEAN IF YOU SAID THAT TO ME SIX MONTHS AGO 
I'D SAY I WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT IT'S TOO EXTREME 
THE FIGHT WILL TAKE PLACE AROUND A ZULU ROYAL WEDDING AND IT'S JUST EIGHT DAYS AWAY 
WHAT ARE WE DOING WHAT ARE WE DOING 
IT'S JUST GONNA BE ABSOLUTELY GHASTLY IF I GET KNOCKED IN MY HEAD AND KNOCKED OUT 
WHILE IN THE VILLAGE THE ATHLETES HAVE TO EARN THEIR KEEP BY HELPING OUT 
THE CATTLE DIP IS WHERE YOUNG ZULUS TRADITIONALLY LEARN TO STICK FIGHT 
AND IT'S WHERE RAJKO AND COREY ARE HAVING THEIR FIRST LESSON 
AND SINCE THEY'RE JUST BEGINNERS THEY CAN'T BE LET LOOSE WITH ACTUAL STICKS 
SO INSTEAD MACHINE STARTS THEM OFF WITH SOME NICE SOFT BRANCHES 
O. K. SO TO THE SIDE AND THEN TO THE MIDDLE 
LIKE THIS AND THEN LIKE THIS 
OH O. K. 
THEN HE BLOCKS IN THE MIDDLE 
TURN IT UP O. K. RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT 
THE FAKE OUT 
I THINK I'VE CONSISTENTLY SHOWN THAT I'M A PRETTY BIG PANSY WHEN IT COMES TO THE CONTACT SPORTS 
WHERE IS THIS BUG BUG SPECIALIST COREY IS NO FIGHTER 
LET'S SEE THE REAL CREEPY CRAWLIES 
A HARVARD INTELLECTUAL HIS SPORTS ARE ABOUT ENDURANCE AND TECHNIQUE 
IF IT COMES DOWN TO STRENGTH I'M DEFINITELY THE WEAKLING 
IN BRAZIL KALAPALO WRESTLERS MADE HIM EAT DIRT OH DAMN IT 
AND NEARLY BROKE HIS NECK 
THAT WAS DANGEROUS IT JUST SEEMS UNNECESSARY 
SO CAN COREY STICK IT OUT IN AFRICA 
YOU BLOCK WITH THIS HAND AND HIT WITH THE OTHER HAND 
BUT IT'S QUITE HARD TO CONCENTRATE ON BLOCKING WHILE YOU'RE HITTING 
I THINK WE'RE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE BECAUSE HE TONKED ME ON THE HEAD A GOOD FEW TIMES 
AND IF THIS WAS AN ACTUAL STICK I THINK I'D HAVE A CRACKED SKULL 
RICHARD'S ALSO AT THE CATTLE DIP 
HIS COACH GOES BY THE NAME OF GREEN COW 
THESE ARE GREEN COW'S COWS UM 
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THESE ONES AT LEAST 
GET HURRIED ALONG THAT'S WHY I'M MOVING IN WITH A STICK AND 
IF ANY OF THESE START TO STRAGGLE THEN I'LL START IMPOSING SOME JUSTICE 
COME ON 
TWENTY YEAR OLD RICHARD IS AN OXFORD THEOLOGY GRADUATE WITH A PASSION FOR SPORT 
ON THE SURFACE I'M A BIT OF A LIGHTWEIGHT 
BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT I CAN BE SURPRISINGLY TOUGH 
THE QUINTESSENTIAL ENGLISHMAN THEN 
I NORMALLY STICK TO THE RULES AND AT THE SAME TIME I LOVE TO WIN I HATE LOSING 
IN BRAZIL HIS UPPER LIP REMAINED IMPRESSIVELY STIFF 
THIS IS REALLY QUITE SERIOUS PAIN ACTUALLY 
BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE WRESTLING HE WAS GIVEN A DAMN GOOD THRASHING 
HE SLAMMED ME ROUND ALL OVER THE PLACE IT FELT LIKE I WAS IN A CAR CRASH 
AND IN RICHARD'S WORLD CRACKING SKULLS WITH STICKS JUST ISN'T 
WELL YOU KNOW 
YEAH I THINK HE'S SENSING THAT I'M RELUCTANT TO USE MY STICK 
DOWN BY THE RIVER STRONGMAN BRAD AND KICKBOXER MARK HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH HITTING 
THEIR TEACHER KNO IS MAKING THEM USE PLASTIC BOTTLES 
IT'S A RUDE AWAKENING YOU KNOW 
MY WHOLE TACTIC OF AGGRESSION AND JUST CHARGING IN IS NOT GONNA WORK 
AHH 
HAVING DONE MARSHAL ARTS BEFORE AND OBVIOUSLY DANCING 
I'VE GOT CO ORDINATION AND I KNOW HOW TO FIGHT 
MARK'S SALSA DANCING SKILLS MAKE HIM THE FINESSE ATHLETE 
BUT HE'S NO SISSY IN THE RING KICKBOXING MAKES YOU STRONGER 
MAKES YOU FASTER MAKES YOU REACT QUICKER 
IN BRAZIL THOUGH MARK'S POWERS FAILED HIM 
AND HE WAS THROWN OUT OF THE VILLAGE 
FOR ME TO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TAKE PART IN BRAZIL AND NOT TO WIN 
MEANT A LOT TO ME COS I ALWAYS WANT TO ACHIEVE 
I ALWAYS WANT TO WIN AND I WANT TO DO IT FOR MY DAD 
MARK'S DAD DIED NINE YEARS AGO 
COMING TO SOUTH AFRICA NOW I REALLY WANNA WIN 
I REALLY WANNA WIN THIS NEXT ONE FOR MYSELF AND FOR MY DAD 
IN JUST SIX DAYS' TIME OUR ATHLETES ARE EXPECTED TO STICK FIGHT AT A ZULU ROYAL WEDDING 
THE TOUGHEST FIGHTERS FROM MILES AROUND WILL COME TOGETHER 
FOR AN AFTERNOON OF OLD FASHIONED MINDLESS VIOLENCE 
TIME IS TIGHT SO WHILST THE OTHERS MUCK ABOUT WITH TWIGS AND BOTTLES 
GREEN COW GIVES RICHARD AND JASON A BIT OF PADDING 
HE PLANS TO LET THEM LOOSE WITH THE REAL THING 
HE'S SWINGING THAT THING PRETTY HARD 
IT'S QUITE A LIMITED PROTECTION THEY GIVE YOU 
BEING A POLITE SORT OF CHAP RICHARD HASN'T QUITE GOT THE HANG OF SUCH WANTON VIOLENCE 
IT'S FRUSTRATING HIS COACH 
I THINK MY MAIN CONCERN AT THE MOMENT IS JUST AS MUCH 
THE ACTUAL DIFFICULTY OF HAVING TO HIT SOMEONE REALLY HARD AS IT IS THE FEAR OF THE PAIN OF BEING HIT 
NO SUCH PROBLEMS FOR JASON 
YOU FEEL LIKE A RAT IN THE CORNER GETTING CHASED BY A DAMN CAT 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE YOUR WAY OUT OF IT 
WHERE YOU KNOW I WANT TO COME INTO THIS CAT FIGHT AS A CAT NOT A MOUSE 
TWENTY YEAR OLD JASON ISN'T THE KIND OF BLOKE YOU'D CALL A MOUSE 
BROUGHT UP ON A DIET OF B. M. X. AND BRAWLING HE'S NEVER HAPPIER THAN WHEN THINGS GET DIRTY 
MY DAD TAUGHT ME ALWAYS PHYSICAL IT WAS LIKE LAST RESORT 
BUT I MEAN I AIN'T GOT NO PROBLEM GETTING PHYSICAL THAT'S FOR SURE 
IN BRAZIL HE WAS A FIRM FAVOURITE TO WIN 
THEY JUST WANNA KICK OUR ASS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO 
UNTIL HE WAS SURPRISINGLY BEATEN BY RAJKO AND THE CHIEF THREW HIM OUT OF THE VILLAGE 
I'M PROBABLY LETTING DOWN THE WHOLE B. M. X. WORLD RIGHT NOW 
NOW THE YOUNGEST ATHLETE HERE NEEDS TO PROVE HE CAN WIN WHEN IT COUNTS 
WHILE THEY'RE NOT TRAINING OUR ATHLETES HAVE TO HELP THEIR TRIBE FAMILIES 
ROUND HERE THE BIGGER YOUR HOME THE HIGHER YOUR STATUS AND KNO IS PLANNING AN EXTENSION 
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO LEVEL THIS OUT TO START BUILDING THE HOUSE 
WELL IT'S NICE FOR US BEING YOU KNOW FIT AND MYSELF SORT OF STRONG AND BRAD REALLY STRONG 
YOU KNOW JUST TO MAKE HIS LIFE A BIT EASIER 
BUT EVEN WHILE THEY WORK THE CONVERSATION KEEPS COMING ROUND TO STICK FIGHTING 
THE CHIEF'S BROTHER WAS SAYING HOW HE HAD HIS SKULL FRACTURED BY ONE OF THE STICKS 
BECAUSE IT CAUGHT HIM AND HE WAS IN HOSPITAL FOR THREE MONTHS AND HE STILL GETS HEADACHES EVERY DAY 
I SUPPOSE THE WORRYING THING IS THAT I DON'T WANNA GO HOME AND BE IN HOSPITAL FOR THREE MONTHS 
IF I'M HONEST YEAH 
AND THAT I CAN SEE THAT HAPPENING TO ONE OF US I REALLY CAN 
IF IT'S FULL PELT WITH UNPADDED STICKS 
SO FAR THE COACHES ARE PLEASED WITH THE ATHLETES' PROGRESS 
BUT THEY WANT THEM TO BECOME MORE ZULU 
THIS IS NO GIRLY LINE DANCE IT'S A STRICTLY MALE ONLY FACE OFF 
THE CHALLENGE IS TO DANCE IN PERFECT HARMONY FOR UP TO TWENTY MINUTES 
THIS IS A SERIOUS BUSINESS AND EVERYONE'S WATCHING 
THEY FOUND IT HILARIOUS WHEN YOU KNOW I GOT MY TIMING ALL OVER THE SHOP 
TWO GIRLS CAME UP AND 
YOU KNOW GAVE ME REAL TALKING TO BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THE RIGHT WORDS 
OUR LOT ARE FAST BECOMING A LAUGHING STOCK 
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE THIS DANCE AND THIS SINGING REPRESENTS OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR COMMUNITY IS TOGETHER 
IT'S JUST LIKE THIS HUGE MESSAGE OF UNITY THAT REVELLED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE MUSIC REALLY MOVING 
YEAH RICH TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF WORK 
RAJKO AND COREY YOU KNOW THEY PULLED IT OFF BUT YEAH I ENJOYED IT 
MAN I ENJOYED IT AND I'M GLAD EVERYBODY ELSE DID TOO 
AS THE DAYS GO ON OUR ATHLETES TRAIN FOR THEIR LIVES 
COME THE DAY OF THE WEDDING THEY'LL BE THROWN IN AGAINST SOME OF THE BEST ZULU WARRIORS IN THE DISTRICT 
THEY MIGHT HAVE STARTED TO LOOK LIKE STICK FIGHTERS BUT INSIDE THEIR HEADS IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT STORY 
IT'S DEFINITELY A MENTAL SPORT ON A COUPLE OF LEVELS 
ONE THAT YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY FOCUSED AND 
IF YOU START GETTING SCARED YOU'RE GONNA GET HURT MORE 
PULLING OUT OF THE COMPETITION WILL ALWAYS BE ON THE TABLE 
IT HAS BEEN FROM THE BEGINNING WHEN WE SAW THE BLOOD GUSHING FROM HIS HEAD 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M GONNA CONSTANTLY HAVE TO REVISIT 
IS THIS A GOOD IDEA IS THIS REALLY REALLY GONNA HURT US 
I DON'T THINK I WANT TO WATCH IT LET ALONE PLAY IT 
I DON'T FEEL LIKE A ZULU WARRIOR AT ALL IF I'M HONEST 
I'VE BEEN MADE TO FEEL PART OF THE TRIBE WHICH IS GREAT 
BUT I DON'T THINK I'M ANYWHERE NEAR THE STANDARD YET 
IF OUR ATHLETES ARE TO HAVE ANY CHANCE OF SURVIVING THE STICK FIGHTING BLOODBATH 
THEY NEED MORE THAN ZULU SKILLS 
THEY NEED SOME ZULU BRAVERY 
THEY'RE JOINING OTHER YOUNG STICK FIGHTERS 
IN AN ANCIENT CEREMONY DESIGNED TO PROVE THEIR MANHOOD 
IT'S CALLED RATHER WORRYINGLY TAKING THE MEAT 
THE MAN IN CHARGE IS STICK FIGHTING COMMANDER JAJUSA 
ALL THE STICK FIGHTERS HAVE TO DO IS TO GRAB A PIECE OF MEAT 
PLACED IN OPEN GROUND BUT ANYONE LUNATIC ENOUGH TO TAKE IT WILL HAVE TO DEFEND IT 
JAJUSA WANTS TO KNOW IF ANY OF THEM HAVE THE GUTS 
THE LOCALS ATTACK HIM ONE AFTER ANOTHER 
AFTER ANOTHER 
O. K. 
YEAH THE BIG MAN HE WAS LIKE YEAH GOOD JOB 
AND I GUESS BASICALLY WHAT HE SAID WAS THAT I'M DOING FREAKING AWESOME 
WE GREW UP REAL ROUGH AND 
FIGHTING IS FUN TO ME 
I LIKE TO FIGHT AND SOON AS HE SAID GO GET THE PIECE OF MEAT 
MY MIND SAID ARE YOU A WINNER OR ARE YOU A LOSER 
I JUMPED UP AND I DECIDED TO BE A WINNER AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED 
JASON SNAGS THE MEAT HE'S GRUBBING ON IT REAL QUICK 
AND ABOUT FOUR CATS JUST MOB HIM 
I MEAN THEY GO TO WORK 
AND HE HAD TO FEND OFF ABOUT THREE FIGHTERS I THINK IN ONE GO WHICH HE DID PRETTY WELL 
HE'S VERY KEEN ABOUT THIS SPORT AND HE'S GETTING BETTER EVERY DAY 
I'D LIKE TO SAY I'D BACK MYSELF BUT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED 
IF HE'S THE GUY THAT WALKS AWAY WITH A VICTORY FROM THIS ONE 
JASON'S MEAT CRAZED BRAVERY HAS MADE HIM THE FIRM FAVOURITE 
BUT FITNESS EXPERT RAJKO ISN'T CONVINCED 
I THINK JASON WAS THE IMMEDIATE FAVOURITE 
BUT QUITE OFTEN IN THESE SPORTS HE IS BECAUSE HE THROWS HIMSELF FULLY INTO IT AND THEN KIND OF 
ALMOST PRESENTS HIMSELF AS THE FAVOURITE 
BUT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN HE IS 
I'M SOMEWHERE AMONGST THE TOP FOUR 
BUT I'M NOT PUTTING MYSELF AS THE FAVOURITE 
RAJKO IS A SUPREME ATHLETE DEDICATED TO PERFECTING HIS MIND AS WELL AS HIS BODY 
I BELIEVE THE MIND IS VERY POWERFUL AND IF YOU BELIEVE AND SEE SOMETHING 
IN YOUR MIND YOU CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN IN YOUR LIFE 
HE'S A CHRISTIAN AND A PACIFIST 
BUT THAT DIDN'T HOLD HIM BACK IN BRAZIL 
I REALLY FELT I WAS GONNA WIN THAT ONE 
I CAME THAT CLOSE TO WINNING BUT IT WASN'T TO BE 
SO WILL HIS NEW FOUND AGGRESSION HELP HIM OUT IN AFRICA 
BUT NOT ALL OUR ATHLETES ARE AS CONFIDENT AS RAJKO 
ON THE EDGE OF THE VILLAGE THE LOCAL WITCH DOCTOR HAS A NEW PATIENT 
RICHARD 
STRENGTH FOR THE COMPETITION ON SUNDAY 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT BOTTLES THEY'VE GOT AROUND 
THERE'S BRAKE FLUID SOME RUM VEGETABLES ALL OVER THE PLACE 
THERE'S NO REASON WHY THAT SHOULD MAKE YOU A BETTER FIGHTER 
BUT THEN I SORT OF HAVE THIS THEORY THAT EACH DIFFERENT PLACE IS KIND OF GOVERNED BY ITS OWN RULES 
AND IF THIS IS THE MEDICINE MAN OF THIS TOWN 
HE SHOULD BE GIVEN AS MUCH SWAY AS A DOCTOR IN AN ENGLISH TOWN 
A LOT OF BITS IN IT IT LOOKS LIKE A JUG OF PIMMS 
RICHARD'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH A PROBLEM 
APART FROM BRAVE MEAT STEALER JASON WAR COMMANDER JAJUSA DOESN'T RECKON 
ANY OF OUR ATHLETES ARE ON TRACK TO MAKE IT AS ZULUS 
SO HE'S GOING TO TEACH THEM HOW TO INTIMIDATE THEIR OPPONENTS BY SINGING WAR CHANTS 
NOT VERY SCARY SO FAR 
IT'S SLIGHTLY LIKE BEING IN CHURCH WITHOUT A HYMN BOOK 
AND YOU MOUTH YOUR WAY ALONG AND TRY AND PRETEND THAT YOU'RE ON THE SAME PAGE AS EVERYONE ELSE 
WHEN IN FACT WE DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE 
HE SAID THIS ISN'T A JOKE AND IF YOU LAUGH YOU'RE GONNA GET ABSOLUTELY PASTED 
FINALLY THE MESSAGE SEEMS TO BE GETTING THROUGH 
WE LEARNED CONFIDENCE IS HUGE HUGE 
IF WE WALK IN CONFIDENT THE OTHER TEAM WON'T THINK THEY CAN TAKE AS MUCH ADVANTAGE OF US 
UNTIL HE JOINED THE LAST MAN STANDING TEAM BRAD HAD NEVER LEFT THE UNITED STATES 
FROM THE TIME THAT I REALISED WE WERE GONNA BE IN AFRICA 
THE WHOLE TIME I JUST KNEW I WAS GONNA LEARN HOW TO MAKE A DRUM 
IT'S PHENOMENAL TO BE ABLE TO WALK AROUND AND SEE PEOPLE 
THAT ARE LIKE YOU AND COMING HERE I'M REALIZING HOW STRONG AND POWERFUL THESE PEOPLE ARE 
AND HOW THEY DON'T REALLY FEAR ANYTHING 
BEING WITH THE ZULU HAS MADE HIM THINK ABOUT THE RACISM HE SUFFERED AT HOME 
OH MAN I DON'T KNOW ANY BLACK PERSON MY AGE OR OLDER 
THAT HASN'T ENCOUNTERED RACISM 
AND IT'S A TRIP BECAUSE MY WIFE IS WHITE 
AND WHEN WE WERE DATING I WOULD TELL HER A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME 
AND I'M LIKE IT'S ONLY HAPPENING BECAUSE I'M BLACK 
AND SHE'S LIKE OH YOU GOT PULLED OVER COS YOU'RE PLAYING YOUR MUSIC TOO LOUD 
BUT ONCE SHE STARTED RIDING WITH ME A LITTLE BIT MORE 
SHE REALISED I GET PULLED OVER JUST COS I'M GETTING PULLED OVER 
STRONGMAN BRAD IS THE ONLY ATHLETE WHO'S MARRIED 
OH YEAH HE'S MY ACTION HERO 
BRAD'S COMPETING IN LAST MAN STANDING JUST TO MAKE HIS FAMILY PROUD OF HIM 
BRAD'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO WIN 
AND IN BRAZIL HE DID 
THIS IS BRUTAL WRESTLING HIS WAY TO VICTORY 
THAT'S RIGHT I'M BRAD 
NOW IN AFRICA HE'S OUT TO MAKE IT TWO IN A ROW 
BEING HERE HAS MADE ME MORE CONNECTED TO MY PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
MADE ME APPRECIATE WHERE I'M AT AND WHERE I'M FROM 
AND I ALMOST FEEL RECHARGED REVITALISED THE FACT THAT I'VE BEEN HERE 
YEAH 
YEAH 
OUR ATHLETES ARE HERE TO TAKE PART IN STICK FIGHTING 
THE CLIMAX TO ANY BIG ZULU CELEBRATION 
AND IN JUST TWENTY FOUR HOURS' TIME THEY'LL FIGHT AT A ZULU ROYAL WEDDING 
BUT BEFORE THEY CAN THEY'VE GOT A PAINFUL HURDLE TO CLEAR 
UNTIL NOW THEY'VE TRAINED WITH PADDED STICKS 
TODAY THE PADS COME OFF 
I GUESS WE'RE GONNA GO HAVE OUR SELECTION DAY FIRST DAY WE FIGHT WITHOUT THE PADS 
GONNA GO UP THERE AND FIGHT AGAINST THIS LITTLE KID 
SUPPOSEDLY HE'S LIKE THE FREAKING BRUCE LEE OF STICK FIGHTING 
THIS LITTLE KID IS THE BEST FIGHTER IN THE WHOLE VALLEY 
HIS NAME TRANSLATES AS KNOCK YOU OUT 
I'M EXPECTING A FEW BRUISED BONES TODAY COS I DO GET HIT 
AND THEN I PUT IN THE FACT THAT THAT COULD BE A REAL STICK TOMORROW AND I'LL HAVE A BROKEN LEG 
YEAH I'M ALL RIGHT SO FAR MENTALLY 
IT'S JUST I HAVEN'T REALLY FELT THE REAL STICK YET SO 
I'LL KNOW FOR SURE THEN 
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THEY ARRIVED OUR ATHLETES COULD GET PROPERLY PAINFULLY HURT 
IN THE FACE OF DANGER THREE STRONG CONTENDERS ARE STARTING TO EMERGE 
RAJKO'S SPEED AND MENTAL TOUGHNESS HAVE GIVEN HIM A STYLISH TECHNIQUE 
BRAD IS A LITTLE LESS WELL SOPHISTICATED 
BUT HIS BRUTE STRENGTH GIVES HIM A HARD HITTING STYLE 
BUT JASON'S LONG REACH AND SLIGHTLY UNSETTLING AGGRESSION KEEP HIM THE FIRM FAVOURITE 
EVEN IF HE'S NOT SO HOT ON DEFENCE 
I GOT HIT ON MY RIBS A LITTLE BIT 
BUT JASON'S NOT CLINCHED IT YET BECAUSE RICHARD MARK AND COREY ARE ALSO STARTING TO GET IT 
ALL THE ATHLETES HELD THEIR OWN AN INCREDIBLE FEAT ACCOMPLISHED IN JUST SIX DAYS 
AFTER THE FIGHT THE CHIEF MAKES A PRESENTATION 
TO FINALLY HAVE THE REAL DEAL SHIELD AND FIGHTING STICK FEELS PRETTY AWESOME 
I'VE BECOME A ZULU ZULU WARRIOR STICK FIGHTER 
NOT MANY PEOPLE CAN SAY THAT IN THE WORLD 
IT WAS KIND OF LIKE UH GRADUATING YOU KNOW 
BEFORE THEY PROBABLY SEEN US AS CHILDREN NOW THEY SEE US AS MEN 
OUR ATHLETES HAVE MADE IT AS ZULUS 
BUT WHEN THE COMMANDER'S NOT AROUND HIS NEW WARRIORS AREN'T QUITE AS BRAVE AS HE MIGHT THINK 
IT'S A CASE OF IS IT WORTH THE RISK 
I WANT TO DOMINATE AT THIS SPORT 
BUT IN THE SAME HAND YOU KNOW HOW AM I GONNA PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME 
ONCE I GET HOME I HAVE A DAUGHTER TO CARE FOR 
I HAVE A FAMILY DEPENDING ON ME TO BE ABLE TO GO HOME 
AND DO WHAT I NEED TO DO TO MAKE MONEY TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE 
IF IT LOOKS TOO DANGEROUS I'M NOT GONNA DO IT THAT'S MY FINAL DECISION 
I'M JUST STARTING TO THINK THAT YOU KNOW I MIGHT NOT DO IT 
PLAIN AND SIMPLE 
I KNOW I'M GETTING GOOD AT IT AND I KNOW I CAN BANG 
I KNOW RIGHT NOW I CAN GO IN THERE AND AGAINST THE AVERAGE ZULU STICK FIGHTER 
I CAN I CAN HANDLE MY OWN THAT'S FOR SURE 
BUT YOU KNOW AGAINST THE BEST GUYS I'M JUST GONNA GET BEAT TO SHIT 
IT'S THE DAY OF THE ROYAL WEDDING 
AND THE STICK FIGHTERS ARE PREPARING FOR BATTLE 
IF OUR LOT PULL OUT NOW IT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE HUMILIATION 
PROBABLY SHITTING A BRICK WHEN THE TIME COMES 
LIKE I SAY I'M STILL NOT EVEN SURE WHETHER I'M GONNA DO IT OR NOT YET 
SO SEE HOW I FEEL ON THE ER GET A FEEL OF WHAT'S GOING ON 
IT'S TIME FOR RICHARD TO TAKE THE WITCH DOCTOR'S POTION 
BUT BEFORE HE DRINKS IT HE'S BEEN TOLD TO WASH IN IT 
I'M GONNA TRY AND GIVE THIS AS MUCH CREDIBILITY AS I CAN BECAUSE IF I CAN GET MYSELF TO BELIEVE IT 
THAT HELPS THEN AT THE END OF THE DAY 
AS STUPID AS IT MAY LOOK I'LL STILL FIGHT BETTER 
I WAS WARNED BY THE WITCH DOCTOR THAT BECAUSE I'M NEW TO THIS CUSTOM 
I REALLY HAVE TO YOU KNOW MAKE MYSELF SICK 
THAT'S REALLY NOT NICE THE RATHER TRICKY BIT IS TO GET IT BACK OUT AGAIN 
THERE WE GO 
IT'S A STRANGE KIND OF MAGIC 
I DON'T THINK STICK FIGHTING COULD EVER BE AS BAD AS THAT SO IT'S PUT ME IN A GOOD FRAME OF MIND 
IT'S COUNTDOWN TO THE FIGHT 
BUT WILL OUR ATHLETES EVEN SHOW UP 
DOWN IN THE VALLEY THE ROYAL WEDDING IS BEGINNING 
IT'S THE SPECIAL DAY FOR A LOCAL GIRL WHO'S MARRYING A ZULU PRINCE 
IN TWO HOURS THE CEREMONY WILL BE COMPLETE 
AND OUR ATHLETES WILL BE EXCEPTED TO FIGHT IN HONOUR OF THE BRIDGE AND GROOM 
AS ZULU WARRIORS CONVERGE FROM ALL OVER THE REGION 
OUR SIX ATHLETES ARE DESPERATELY SEARCHING FOR THE COURAGE TO JOIN THEIR TRIBE IN BATTLE 
MEANWHILE THE WEDDING'S IN FULL SWING 
THE BRIDE'S RED VEIL REFLECTS HER CHASTITY THE KNIFE HER PROWESS IN THE KITCHEN 
FINALLY THE COUPLE BECOME ONE 
AS THE ATHLETES ARRIVE THE TRIBES START TO TAUNT AND INSULT EACH OTHER 
IT'S A REAL TENSE ATMOSPHERE A REAL TENSE ATMOSPHERE 
AND YOU LOOK AROUND AND YOU SEE WHO YOU'RE GONNA COME UP AGAINST 
IT'S TIME TO FIGHT 
IN THIS SPORT THERE ARE ONLY THREE WAYS TO WIN 
FORCE YOUR OPPONENT TO GIVE UP KNOCK HIM OUT OR SPILL HIS BLOOD 
OUR ATHLETES ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE ON ALL COMERS FROM THE OTHER TRIBES 
WHEN IT'S OVER THE WAR COMMANDERS WILL CHOOSE ONE OF THEM AS THE LAST MAN STANDING 
THAT'S ASSUMING ANY OF THEM DARE TO ENTER THE RING IN THE FIRST PLACE 
WITHIN MINUTES IT'S FIRST BLOOD TO A VISITING TRIBE 
AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY ANOTHER LOCAL MAN GOES DOWN BADLY 
OH SHIT 
IT'S LIKE A GANG FIGHT MAN 
WITH THE ARENA SPATTERED IN BLOOD YOU'D THINK OUR ATHLETES WOULD KEEP THEIR HEADS WELL DOWN 
RIGHT YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL MAN 
BUT ONE OF THEM HAS OTHER IDEAS 
BRAD HAS A WIFE AND KID AT HOME BUT HERE AND NOW PRIDE IS AT STAKE 
THE DUDES THAT WE WERE GOING AGAINST 
HATED US AND DESPISED US BEING THERE AND WERE THERE TO PROVE A POINT 
AND MY GAME PLAN THE WHOLE TIME HAS BEEN INTIMIDATION 
I'M GONNA EITHER BREAK A SHIELD OR I'M GONNA BREAK HIS HAND ONE OR THE OTHER 
I'M NOT LOSING 
GO ON BRAD 
WELL DONE BRAD 
HIT THE SHIELD HE TAKES A COUPLE OF STEPS BACK 
I HIT HIM AGAIN HE TAKES A FEW MORE STEPS BACK 
I HIT HIM AGAIN HE TAKES ANOTHER STEP BACK 
I HIT HIM AGAIN HE'S DOWN 
HELL MAN I WAS PROUD YOU KNOW I WAS PROUD OF MYSELF AT THAT MOMENT 
COME ON RICHARD 
HIGH ON BRAD'S WIN AND MAYBE THAT STUFF FROM THE WITCH DOCTOR RICHARD MAKES A MOVE 
COME ON RICH THE MOMENT IT STARTED I KNEW THAT 
THIS WAS A SURVIVAL CONTEST REALLY THIS WASN'T JUST A GAME 
SEEING HIS MAN IN TROUBLE THE WAR COMM ANDER MOVES IN RICHARD'S LOST 
THE FORCE OF HIS HITS ON THE SHIELD THAT I WAS HOLDING WAS 
IT REALLY TOOK MY BREATH AWAY 
IT FLUNG MY HAND RIGHT BACK AND IT STUNG ALL OF MY FINGERS 
WELL DONE RICHARD 
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST INTENSE FEELINGS EVER 
I MEAN YOU'RE THERE SURROUNDED BY MAYBE THREE HUNDRED ZULUS CHANTING 
YOU'RE ARMED WITH NOTHING BUT A TINY SHIELD AND THIS STICK 
AGAINST THIS GUY WHO'S DONE IT ALL HIS LIFE 
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT IT'S SCARY 
GO ON COREY WELL DONE SON 
SMELLING BLOOD THE OPPOSITION NOW DEMAND A SHOT AT COREY 
BUT SENSING COREY'S NERVES AND THE LOOK OF HIS OPPONENT THE WAR COMMANDER SENDS BACK THE CHALLENGER 
COREY'S NOT ALLOWED TO FIGHT 
I WAS ACTUALLY SCARED FOR MY OWN LIFE 
WE WERE SEEING PEOPLE GETTING CUTS ON THEIR HEAD AND BLEEDING 
OUT OF THEIR BRAIN AND YOU KNOW GROSS STUFF AND I DIDN'T WANT TO BE MUCH PART OF THAT 
INCENSED BY THE REJECTED CHALLENGE AND COREY'S SPECIAL PROTECTION TEMPERS START TO BOIL OVER 
AT THAT POINT EVERYBODY JUST STARTS MOBBING IN AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON 
THIS VILLAGE ARE NUTS 
WITH SOME SEMBLANCE OF ORDER RESTORED MARK IS ALLOWED TO ENTER THE FRAY 
I COULD GO HOME WITH A BROKEN ARM 
I COULD GO HOME WITH A FRACTURED SKULL 
THE FEAR CERTAINLY PUSHED ME FORWARDS 
IT MADE ME ATTACK IT MADE ME REALLY SWITCH ON AND GO FOR IT 
HIS OPPONENT IS ONE OF THE RIVAL TRIBE'S HARDEST MEN 
BUT AMAZINGLY MARK'S SOLID DEFENCE FRUSTRATES HIS OPPONENT 
ADRENALINE I DIDN'T GET HIT 
THAT WAS SCARY 
ENCOURAGED ON BY BRAD AND MARK'S SUCCESS RAJKO STEPS UP 
COME ON RAJKO FOCUS MAN NOTHING NOTHING 
RAJKO'S SECRET WEAPON IS HIS INNER STRENGTH 
YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY FOCUSED 
AND IF YOU START GETTING SCARED AND CHICKENING OUT PROBABLY YOU'RE GONNA GET HURT MORE 
JUST LOOK INTO THE EYES OF YOUR OPPONENT DON'T BE DISTRACTED BY ANYTHING 
AND THEN YOUR MIND WILL CARRY YOU FURTHER THAN YOUR BODY WOULD OTHERWISE 
IT'S THE LONGEST FIGHT SO FAR 
BUT RAJKO'S STRENGTH IS FINALLY TOO MUCH FOR HIS OPPONENT 
HE QUITS AND RAJKO WINS 
COACH GREEN COW IS DELIGHTED 
AS SOON AS YOU GO IN THERE YOUR HEART STARTS GOING DOOF DOOF DOOF 
OF OUR ATHLETES ONLY JASON IS LEFT TO FIGHT 
AND FINALLY THE STAR OF TRAINING TAKES TO THE RING 
I LOVE TO GET IN THERE AND FIGHT 
WHEN SOMEONE'S TRYING TO ATTACK ME I LIKE TO HIT THEM BACK 
IT FEELS GOOD TO KNOW THAT THIS IS MY TERRITORY 
IN SECONDS JASON FORCES HIS OPPONENT TO BACK DOWN 
AFTER BRAD MARK AND RAJKO HE'S THE FOURTH ATHLETE STILL STANDING 
THE QUESTION IS WHICH ONE PERFORMED BEST 
THE WAR CHIEFS CAN'T DECIDE BETWEEN TWO OF THE WINNERS JASON AND MARK 
SO GUESS WHAT THEY'RE THROWN BACK INTO THE RING 
FIRST TO FIGHT IS MARK 
YOU WEREN'T AWARE OF ANYTHING AROUND YOU BECAUSE IT WAS SO DANGEROUS 
I JUST FOCUSED SO HARD ON DEFENDING MYSELF 
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN MY BRAIN JUST SEEMED TO SWITCH ON AND WENT INTO COMBAT MODE 
MARK WINS AFTER KNOCKING THE STICK OUT OF HIS OPPONENT'S HANDS 
I DIDN'T GET HIT ONCE IN THAT FIGHT 
AND I RECKON IF I WOULD HAVE GOT HIT I WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT 
BUT I JUST REMEMBER ATTACKING AND DEFENDING AND DOING EVERYTHING 
THAT WAS TAUGHT WHICH FOR ME I COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR ANYTHING MORE OF MYSELF 
SO IT'S ALL DOWN TO THE LAST FIGHT AND JASON CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE 
IT'S AN INTENSE MOMENT 
I MEAN WHAT IF I GET A GASH JUST RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF MY FACE 
IF YOU'RE GONNA DO IT GET UP AND DO IT EITHER MAN UP OR GO HOME 
JASON BEGINS CAUTIOUSLY 
BUT THEN HE DECIDES TO LET RIP 
JASON WINS 
I WAS HAPPY WITH HOW I PERFORMED THAT DAY 
THAT'S IT THE CONTEST IS OVER AND BOTH MEN REMAIN UNBEATEN 
NOW IT'S DOWN TO THE CHIEF TO CHOOSE THE LAST MAN STANDING 
MARK OR JASON 
THANK YOU 
THAT WAS ONE OF THE PROUDEST MOMENTS OF MY LIFE 
I FELT LIKE I FOUGHT WELL AND I FELT IT 
I WAS ABLE TO FACE DANGER YOU KNOW AND I STOOD STRONG AND I WAS ABLE TO KEEP MY HEAD AND 
COMPETE TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY AND FOR ME THAT'S SOMETHING I'VE NEVER PROVEN TO MYSELF BEFORE 
I'M JUST SPEECHLESS ABSOLUTELY SPEECHLESS 
NEXT TIME ON LAST MAN STANDING 
WHAT THE HELL ARE WE DOING I CAN'T BREATHE IT'S HARDCORE 
OUR ATHLETES RUN A HIGH ALTITUDE ENDURANCE RACE 
IN THE MOUNTAINS OF MEXICO 
FIFTY ONE KILOMETRES 
IT'S UPHILL OVER ROCKS AND JAGGED TERRAIN 
TRYING TO STAY FOCUSED AND IT'S IN SANDALS 
THE SANDALS ARE UTTER SHIT 
I HATE THESE THINGS IT'S GONNA BE SERIOUSLY PAINFUL 
AH SHIT 
I JUST CAN'T DO IT MY BODY WANTS TO GIVE UP THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE WAS THE ESSENCE OF PAIN 
OH
