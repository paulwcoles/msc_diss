SO I HAVE SUMMONED SIXTEEN OF MY FINEST WARRIORS TO A LAND FAR TO THE EAST 
WHERE THEY MUST UNDERGO MANY TRIALS 
TO FIND THE MAGICAL WATERS TO BREAK THIS SPELL 
BUT MY ENEMY HAS FOLLOWED ME HERE 
AND HE MEANS TO STOP THIS QUEST AT ANY COST 
THE QUEST TO DISCOVER THE SECRET TEMPLE 
THE WARRIORS ARE ASSEMBLED UNDER THEIR BANNERS 
YESTERDAY THE FOUR COMMANDERS WERE SELECTED 
AND SO FOR MARCA OF THE TIGERS DESOT OF THE WOLVES 
SONRO OF THE PANTHERS AND YEADA OF THE THE EAGLES 
TODAY WILL BE THE FIRST REAL TEST OF THEIR LEADERSHIP 
SEVEN VIRTUES ARE BEING TESTED EACH VIRTUE WILL BE TESTED TWICE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT VIRTUE FOR A WARRIOR 
WISDOM THEY NEED TO THINK THINGS THROUGH BEFORE THEY DO IT 
COURAGE BEING ABLE TO OVERCOME FEAR AND CARRY ON 
ACCURACY 
GETTING IT RIGHT FIRST TIME 
LEADERSHIP 
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO MANAGE YOUR TEAM AND TAKE INITIATIVE 
TO REACH YOUR GOAL 
THE WARRIORS WILL BE TESTED ON THEIR SPEED STRENGTH COURAGE AND WISDOM 
AS THEY FACE THE FIRST OF FOURTEEN TASKS 
UNDER THE BURNING SUN OF THIS MYSTERIOUS LAND SO 
LET THE DAY'S CHALLENGES BEGIN 
WHO DO YOU THINK'S GONNA GO FIRST 
WHO DO YOU THINK'S GONNA GO FIRST SSH 
THE TASK THAT LIES BEFORE THE TIGERS NOW WILL INDEED TEST THEIR RESOLVE 
THE LEDGE THEY MUST TRAVERSE IS NARROW AND TREACHEROUS 
THEY MUST TREAD ITS FULL LENGTH TO RETRIEVE THE GEMS HANGING OVER THEM 
BUT THERE IS NO BRAVERY WITHOUT FEAR 
AND FEAR IS THE ENEMY WITHIN THAT MUST BE FOUGHT 
AS FIERCELY AS ANY FOE IN BATTLE 
GO ON SOHAR 
GO ON SOHAR DO IT JUST GET TO THE END 
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE JEWELS IT'S TOO HIGH 
YOU'LL BE FINE COME ON SOHAR 
KEEP GOING COME ON YOU CAN DO IT 
KEEP YOUR BALANCE 
COME ON SOHAR YOU CAN DO IT 
SOHAR OF THE TIGERS HAS SHOWN HER COURAGE AND BEEN REWARDED 
I WANTED TO GO FIRST TO SHOW THE OTHER TIGERS 
IF I COULD DO IT THEY COULD ALL DO IT 
WHEN THE GAZELLE IS SURPRISED BY THE TIGER HER ONLY DEFENCE IS SPEED 
YOUR FORTUNE LIES IN THE SWIFTNESS OF YOUR FEET 
THESE PHIALS EACH HAVE A GEM 
THE JEWELS WILL RISE TO THE TOP IF WATER IS ADDED 
THEY ARE THERE FOR THE TAKING BUT BE QUICK 
THE SERPENTS YOU SEE BEFORE YOU HAVE BUT ONE PURPOSE 
TO SEEK OUT THOSE WARRIORS WHO ARE NOT WORTHY OF THE NAME WARRIOR 
THE SPEED OF THE PANTHER IS LEGENDARY 
WILL SONRO AKSU YONRA AND ARTON LIVE UP TO THAT REPUTATION 
YEADA KARJA TAYLAN AND SAMRA OF THE EAGLES 
PREPARE TO MEET THEIR FIRST TASK ON THIS QUEST 
WARRIORS NUMBERS HERE ARE NOT JUST A WAY TO COUNT THE STARS AND STONES 
THEY HAVE MEANING SOME BRING GOOD FORTUNE 
OTHERS SIGNIFY DARKNESS AND TROUBLE 
HERE THE NUMBERS SHOW THE WAY TO THE JEWELS BUT BEFORE YOU BEGIN 
YOU MUST DISCOVER THE ANSWER TO THE RIDDLE LISTEN CAREFULLY 
FROM THE MONTHS OF THE YEAR TAKE THE DAYS OF THE WEEK 
ADD THE SECONDS A MINUTE WILL YIELD TAKE AWAY ALL THE HOURS IN A DAY 
ADD THOSE TWO DIGITS AND YOU'LL KNOW THE WAY 
FOR BEHOLD THE TRUE PATH IS REVEALED 
LOOK IN YOUR BOOK AND THE RIDDLE WILL APPEAR 
O. K. FROM THE MONTHS OF THE YEAR THAT'S TWELVE 
TAKE THE DAYS OF THE WEEK THAT'S SEVEN 
THAT'S FIVE SO THAT MAKES FIVE 
ADD THE SECONDS IN A MINUTE SIXTY SIXTY FIVE 
TAKE AWAY ALL THE HOURS IN A DAY TWENTY FOUR 
FROM SIXTY FIVE POINT FOUR ONE 
ADD THOSE TWO DIGITS SO ADD THE TWO FIVE ADD T. W. O. FIVE 
DOUBLE CHECK IT O. K. TRY IT AGAIN 
FROM THE MONTHS OF THE YEAR TWELVE TAKE THE DAYS OF THE WEEK SEVEN FIVE 
ADD THE SECONDS A MINUTE WILL YIELD THAT'S SIXTY SIXTY FIVE 
TAKE AWAY ALL THE HOURS IN A DAY SIXTY FIVE TWENTY FOUR 
FORTY ONE YEAH IT'S FORTY ONE YEAH 
ADD THOSE TWO DIGITS FOUR ONE IT'S FIVE RIGHT FIVE 
AND YOU'LL KNOW THE WAY 
FOR BEHOLD YOUR TRUE PATH IS REVEALED IT'S FIVE 
THAT'S LIKE TWO PAGES 
FIVE IS THE B. ONE THE ONE LIKE A B. LET'S MAKE A PATH 
MAKE A PATH FIRST WE COULD START OVER THERE 
I THINK THERE BECAUSE OH WAIT 
LET'S DISCUSS WHO'S GONNA GO 
I THINK YOU SHOULD DO IT DO YOU THINK MY LEGS ARE LONG ENOUGH I DO 
YOU'RE FAST AND YOU CAN JUMP QUITE FAR 
I THINK THERE'S ONE HERE 
GO THROUGH THE MIDDLE DO YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE A BIG ENOUGH JUMP 
UM BECAUSE THAT I COULD 
THIS IS A TEST OF A WARRIOR'S STRENGTH 
THESE CHARIOTS MUST BE HAULED TO THE END OF THE COURTYARD AND BACK AGAIN 
FOR THE GEMS TO BE RECOVERED 
BUT THE SCORCHING HEAT OF THE NOONDAY SUN 
IS AS GREAT AN ENEMY AS ANY MORTAL FOE 
TODAY LYMEL HAS SUFFERED MORE THAN MOST UNDER THESE EXTREMES 
SO AS LEADER DESOT HAS ELECTED TO GATHER HER JEWELS AS WELL AS HIS 
THIS IS A BRAVE DECISION BUT IF HE OR ANY OF THE WOLVES PROVE TOO SLOW 
THE ENCIRCLING SPIRIT GUARDS WILL ACT SWIFTLY 
AND ANY UNFORTUNATE WARRIOR WILL BE IMMEDIATELY REMOVED FROM THE QUEST 
TIBOR DESOT AND NEBRA MUST USE ALL THEIR STRENGTH TO COMPLETE THIS TASK 
BEFORE THE SECOND DRUM SOUNDS 
STRENGTH IS NOT ALWAYS DEPENDENT ON SIZE 
SOMETIMES THE SMALLEST WARRIORS CAN SURPRISE US AS NEBRA SHOWS 
WITH ONE JEWEL GAINED 
THE TIGERS ARE UNDAUNTED BY THE GREAT HEIGHT OF THE LEDGE 
BUT WILL HADAV HOLD HIS NERVE 
DON'T LOOK DOWN 
COME ON HADAV 
YOU CAN DO IT 
GO HADAV 
YOU'RE DOING REALLY WELL KEEP ON GOING 
I WAS A BIT NERVOUS AND HESITANT AT THE START 
BUT I REALISED I COULD DO IT AND I REALLY WANTED THE JEWEL FOR THE TEAM 
GO ON MARCA YOU CAN DO IT 
YOU'LL BE FINE 
MARCA IS THE TALLEST OF THE WARRIORS 
BUT IS THIS AN ADVANTAGE ON SUCH A PRECIPITOUS LEDGE 
KEEP GOING MARCA 
YES 
KEEP GOING MARCA 
YES 
GO ON MARCA YOU CAN DO IT YOU'RE DOING IT 
COME ON NEARLY THERE 
YOU'RE DOING REALLY WELL 
KEEP GOING 
IT WAS REALLY SCARY BUT WHEN I GOT THE JEWEL 
I COULDN'T WAIT TO SEE THE REST OF MY TEAM 
THE PANTHERS ARE ENGROSSED IN THEIR WATERY TASK ARTON SEEMS SPEEDIEST 
GOOD LUCK 
TAYLAN WILL ATTEMPT TO PROVE HE HAS THE WISDOM TO BEAT THE RIDDLE TRAP 
BUT THERE MAY BE HIDDEN DANGERS FOR THE EAGLES 
WHERE'S THE NEXT ONE THERE 
AND THEN TO THE ONE ON THE RIGHT YES WELL DONE 
GO ON JUMP IT 
COME ON TAYLAN 
QUICK YOU CAN DO IT YES WELL DONE 
HOW WAS IT HARD ESPECIALLY WHEN THE WALLS CLOSED IN 
TAYLAN SAMRA KARJA AND LEADER YEADA HAVE ESCAPED INTACT 
THE RIDDLE TRAP WAS A SCARY CHALLENGE 
WHEN THE WALLS STARTED CLOSING IN INSTINCT WAS WHAT GOT ME THROUGH 
WOLF NEBRA IS STILL MAKING BETTER PROGRESS THAN HER FELLOWS 
TIBOR AND DESOT MUST HURRY BEFORE THE SECOND DRUM SOUNDS 
GRUNTS OF EFFORT 
GO ON NEBRA 
THE JEWELS ARE WITHIN NEBRA'S GRASP IF ONLY SHE CAN UNHOOK THE POUCH 
TIBOR IS TOO SLOW HE MUST MAKE HASTE IF HE IS TO COMPLETE THE TASK 
DESOT HAS DONE WELL NEBRA IS NEAR THE END BUT TIBOR IS IN DANGER 
THE DARK ONE STAYS IN THE NORTH RAVEN BUT HE WATCHES OUR MOVEMENTS 
HE WILL SOON ATTACK CAN YOU DEFEND THE WARRIORS 
AYE THE DEMONS ARE NO MATCH FOR ME 
THIS STAFF HAS A POWER EQUAL TO HIS MAYBE MORE SO 
THEN THEY ARE SAFE FOR NOW NEVAR IS CUNNING 
HE MAY USE THE DEMONS TO DISTRACT ME AND IF HIS STAFF STRIKES FIRST 
GO ON JENRO GO ON JENRO 
TIGER JENRO ALONE NOW HAS TO FACE THE LEDGE 
WILL HIS COURAGE MATCH THE OTHERS' 
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU DON'T GET THE JEWEL JUST TRY YOUR BEST 
GO ON JENRO THAT'S IT 
COME ON 
SONRO AKSU YONRA AND ARTON ARE NEARING THE END OF THEIR FIRST TASK 
WILL THE PANTHERS COMPLETE IT IN TIME 
KEEP GOING COME ON COME ON 
COME ON QUICK SPEED IT UP 
IT WAS QUITE A HARD CHALLENGE 
MY TACTIC WAS TO SPILL LESS WATER THAN THE OTHERS AND NOT GO THAT FAST 
THIS CHALLENGE WAS A LOT OF FUN 
BUT I'M KIND OF WORRIED BECAUSE OUR TEAM LEADER CAME LAST 
I'M UPSET I CAME LAST BUT WE ALL GOT OUR JEWELS 
ALL THE WATER KEPT SPILLING OUT OF MY JUG 
GO ON TIBOR PULL AS HARD AS YOU CAN 
COME ON NEBRA 
KEEP GOING COME ON KEEP GOING 
NEBRA HAS SUCCEEDED IN HER TASK 
TIBOR IS NOW IN THE GRAVEST PERIL 
THE SPIRIT GUARDS WILL CLAIM HIM IF THE SECOND DRUM SOUNDS 
DON'T GIVE UP 
COME ON TIBOR KEEP COMING 
I'M NEARLY THERE I'M NEARLY THERE 
KEEP PULLING KEEP PULLING 
I'LL GO BACK AND TAKE A RUN UP I'M GONNA DO IT GO ON TIBOR 
KEEP PULLING AS HARD AS YOU CAN

CAREFUL OH

NEARLY THERE 
COME ON TAKE IT YES WELL DONE 
GONNA DO IT 
KEEP GOING HARD AS YOU CAN YOU CAN DO IT 
YES PULL GO ON TIBOR PULL

CHARIOT RACES WAS DEFINITELY 
THE HARDEST CHALLENGE I'VE DONE IT WAS HOT 
WE GOT OVER THE RAMPS BY DOING RUN UPS I HAD TO GET TWO JEWELS 
BECAUSE LYMEL WAS ILL 
I GOT THEM AND CAME FIRST SO I'M REALLY HAPPY 
I WILLED MYSELF TO GET TO THE END 
WITH THE HELP OF MY TEAM MATES AND MY STRENGTH I DID WELL 
WE DID IT YES 
EACH TEAM HAS NOW COMPLETED ONE OF THE FOURTEEN TESTS SET BY SATYARANI 
IN THE DAYS AHEAD THEY MUST GATHER AS MANY JEWELS AS POSSIBLE 
ON THE FIRST DAY THE LEADERS EARNED SIX JEWELS 
THE PANTHERS WOLVES AND TIGERS GAINED FOUR MORE 
BRINGING THEIR TOTAL TO TEN 
BUT THE EAGLES WERE LESS FORTUNATE 
THEY GAINED BUT THREE AT THE RIDDLE TRAP AND NOW HOLD NINE IN ALL 
THE WOLVES ARE ESPECIALLY COMMENDED 
LYMEL SUFFERING THE EFFECTS OF THE SUN WAS UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE 
BUT HER COMRADES MANAGED TO GATHER FOUR JEWELS DESPITE THIS SETBACK 
YES WELL DONE 
DESOT YOU MANAGED TO COLLECT TWO JEWELS IN THE CHARIOT CHALLENGE 
HOW DO YOU FEEL YOUR COMRADES FARED NEBRA FARED QUITE WELL 
SHE KNEW TO DO A RUN UP BEFORE THE BUMPS 
SHE HAD TROUBLE GETTING THE JEWELS BUT DID O. K. 
TIBOR BECAME WORRIED BUT WITH OUR ENCOURAGEMENT HE GOT THROUGH O. K. 
PANIC IS AN ENEMY MUCH LIKE ANY FOE 
TIBOR YOU NOW KNOW HOW IT FEELS TO BE IN ITS GRIP 
WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND DURING THE CHALLENGE I ADMIT I PANICKED 
I GOT A BIT WORRIED WHEN I DIDN'T GET OVER THE RAMPS 
BUT WITH MY TEAM MATES' HELP AND THE WILL TO GO ON I GOT THE JEWEL 
YEADA IN THE RIDDLE TRAP WHY WAS IT DECIDED TO SEND IN TAYLAN 
IN THE LEADERSHIP CHALLENGES HE WAS AGILE 
WHICH WAS WHAT THIS GAME NEEDED 
IT WAS A GOOD DECISION HE WAS VERY FAST 
AND WE WERE REALLY HAPPY WITH HIM SAMRA COULD YOU HAVE DONE BETTER 
I'M NOT SO AGILE SO I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE SO WELL IN THE RIDDLE TRAP 
TAYLAN WHAT DO YOU FEEL 
I THINK THE GROUP MADE A GOOD DECISION 
WE WORKED WELL AND THE ENCOURAGEMENT WAS GREAT 
THE SHADOWS OF THE DAY GROW LONG AND THE WARRIORS PREPARE TO REST 
BUT I MUST CONTINUE TO GUARD THEM 
NEVAR WILL NOT MEET ME FACE TO FACE HE KNOWS HE WILL BE DEFEATED 
BUT HE WILL SEND HIS DEMONS MANY TIMES TO ENDANGER THE WARRIORS 
HE MAY WAIT UNTIL THEY ARE NEARER THE TEMPLE 
OR PERHAPS HE WILL TRY AND TRAP ME IF I AM NOT THERE TO PROTECT THEM 
THEY WILL SURELY BE PICKED OFF ONE BY ONE BY NEVAR'S FIENDS 
I MUST REMAIN VIGILANT AT ALL TIMES 
THERE ARE MANY MORE BATTLES TO BE FOUGHT 
BEFORE THIS QUEST IS FINALLY AT AN END 
NEXT TIME ON RAVEN THE SECRET TEMPLE 
CAN THE TIGERS TACKLE THE PILLARS OF COURAGE 
WILL THE PANTHERS' AGILITY TAKE THEM ACROSS THE BRIDGE 
WILL YEADA CONQUER THE ENCHANTED DEMONS 
DO THE WOLVES HAVE THE SPEED TO BEAT TEMPLE SPIRIT RUN 
NEVAR CONTINUES TO MASS HIS FORCES I MUST BE READY FOR THE INEVITABLE 
WELCOME TO HIDER IN THE HOUSE
