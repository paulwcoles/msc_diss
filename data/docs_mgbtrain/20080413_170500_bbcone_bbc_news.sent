VENTURECO STARTED NINE YEARS AGO 
SENDING SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE ON

THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AND MY HEART 
ABSOLUTELY GOES OUT TO THEM THE THE FIVE YOUNG WOMEN TURNED OUT TO BE

DEATH OF HIS FIANCEE EARLIER THIS 
YEAR YEAR WHAT DO WE ACTUALLY KNOW POLICE 
US THAT A BODY HAS BEEN 
FOUND IN A REMOTE PART OF 
PADDINGTON STATION THEY BELIEVE IT 
TO BE MARK SPEIGHT REMEMBER HE 
WENT MISSING SIX DAYS AGO A 
NATIONWIDE ALERT LOOKING FOR HIM 
HE WAS A MUCH LOVED T. V. PRESENTER 
FOR MORE THAN FOURTEEN YEARS WITH THE 
PROGRAMME SMART MILLIONS OF 
CHILDREN HAVE WATCHED HIM GROWN UP 
WITH 
THIS SAD NEWS THEY 
HAVEN'T SAID HOW HE DIED THE ONLY 
THING THEY'VE SAID SO FAR IS HE 
WASN'T HIT BY A TRAIN 
PEOPLE CLOSE 
TO HIM HAD TALKED OF HIS TROUBLED 
STATE OF MIND 
A TERRIBLE SITUATION 
JANUARY THIRD IN HIS FLAT HIS 
GIRLFRIEND NATASHA COLLINS WAS 
FOUND DEAD SIXTY PER CENT OF HER BODY HAD 
BEEN SCALDED FOUND IN A BATH BATH 
HE ADMITTED THEY'D BEEN PARTYING 
AT THE BEGINNING HE WAS ACTUALLY 
ARRESTED WITH SUSPICION AS TO 
WHETHER WHAT HAD HAPPENED THERE BUT 
WAS COMPLETELY EXONERATED AN 
ACCIDENT OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS 
HE'S SAID TO HAVE BEEN IN A VERY 
TROUBLED STATE OF MIND VERY 
DISTRESSED INDEED HE'D BEEN 
STAYING WITH NATASHA COLLINS' 
MOTHER AND SIX DAYS AGO HE WAS 
SUPPOSED TO MEET HERE IN COVENT 
GARDEN AND HE DIDN'T ARRIVE AT 
THREE POINT THREE OH AND IT WAS SEEN ON CLOSED 
CIRCUIT T. V. FOOTAGE THAT THE LAST 
TIME HE WAS SPOTTED WAS AT QUEEN'S 
PARK TUBE STATION MINUTES BEFORE 
THAT POLICE HAD SEEN HIM LOOKING 
DISTRESSED BUT OF COURSE BY THAT 
POINT HE HADN'T BEEN REPORTED 
MISSING AND THEY ALLOWED HIM TO GO 
ON AND OVER THOSE SIX DAYS SINCE 
THEN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR 
HIM THERE'S BEEN SIGHTINGS THEY 
SAY IN SAINT ALBANS ALL ROUND THE 
COUNTRY IT APPEARS HE TRAVELLED 
ONLY A QUARTER OF A MILE OR SO TO 
PADDINGTON STATION WHERE HIS BODY 
HAS NOW BEEN FOUND 
THE MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY IN 
ZIMBABWE THE MOVEMENT FOR 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE HAS SAID IT WILL 
GO TO COURT TO OPPOSE ANY ATTEMPT 
TO RECOUNT THE VOTES FROM THE 
GENERAL ELECTION 
IT'S ACCUSED PRESIDENT ROBERT 
MUGABE OF TRYING TO RIG THE COUNT 
THEY WERE SPEAKING AFTER A SUMMIT 
OF AFRICAN LEADERS IN THE ZAMBIAN 
CAPITAL LUSAKA FROM WHERE ALLAN 
LITTLE SENT THIS REPORT 
THAT THEY CAME HERE AT ALL IS A 
SIGN OF ONE THING THAT ZIMBABWE'S 
CRISIS IS NOW THEIRS TOO IT IS 
DRAGGING THE ENTIRE SOUTHERN 
AFRICAN REGION IN ITS DOWNWARD 
SPIRAL THE OPPOSITION M. D. C. CAME 
WITH HIGH HOPES THAT THESE THIRTEEN HEADS 
OF STATE WOULD SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE 
AND TELL ROBERT MUGABE TO GO BUT 
THEY FELL FAR SHORT OF THAT 
INSTEAD THEY TOLD THE OPPOSITION 
THAT THEY SHOULD RESPECT THE 
ELECTION RESULT WHEN IT'S ANNOUNCED 
AND GO INTO SECOND ROUND RUN OFF 
AGAINST MR. MUGABE IF NECESSARY THE 
M. D. C. WAS DISMAYED THE BALLOT BOXES 
HAVE BEEN OUT OF SIGHT FOR TWO 
WEEKS NOW THEY SAY NO UNCORRUPTED 
RESULT FROM THE FIRST ROUND IS 
POSSIBLE THE BALLOT PAPERS THEY 
SAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN COOKED OUT 
OF SIGHT OF INDEPENDENT MONITORS 
IT'S NOT LEGAL FOR THE SIMPLE 
REASON THAT ZANU P. F. HAVE ALREADY 
STUFFED THE BALLOT BOXES IN FACT 
TAMPERED WITH THE BALLOT BOXES FOR 
THE PAST TWELVE DAYS 
THE THIRTEEN HEADS OF 
STATE MADE FEW CONCRETE DEMANDS ON 
MR. MUGABE EXCEPT TO SAY THAT THE 
FIRST ROUND RESULTS SHOULD BE 
RELEASED AS THEY PUT IT 
EXPEDITIOUSLY THE ZIMBABWE 
GOVERNMENT DEFENDED THE DELAY IN 
MAKING THE RESULT PUBLIC 
IN ORDER 
TO BE PROFESSIONAL AND TRANSPARENT 
YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS 
HAPPY THAT'S WHY THERE ARE THESE 
DELAYS 
TO THE THIRTEEN HEADS OF STATE DELAYS ASSEMBLED HERE THAT TOLD THE 
OPPOSITION M. D. C. THAT THEY SHOULD IF 
NECESSARY NOW GO INTO A SECOND 
ROUND RUN OFF AGAINST ROBERT MUGABE 
THE M. D. C. HAS ALREADY SAID IT WOULD 
NOT DO DO THAT BECAUSE TO DO SO 
WOULD UNLEASH A WAVE OF VIOLENT 
INTIMIDATION SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE 
OPPOSITION ARE TELLING MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI IT'S NO LONGER FOR HIM 
TO GO SAFE TO ZIMBABWE AND HE 
SHOULD SEEK ASYLUM IN BOTSWANA
