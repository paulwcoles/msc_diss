WELCOME TO THE DAILY POLITICS 
TODAY SURPRISE SURPRISE WE HAVE A 
SPECIAL ELECTION PROGRAMME BUT NOT 
WHAT YOU THINK VOTING IS UNDER WAY 
FOR LOCAL COUNCIL THE PARTY 
LEADERS HAVE VOTED BUT WE CAN'T 
TALK ABOUT THAT IN MUCH DETAIL SO 
INSTEAD WE WILL LOOK AT SOME OTHER 
ELECTIONS HAPPENING ROUND THE WORLD 
WE WILL DISCUSS THE AMERICAN 
PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND THE LATEST 
FROM THE STALLED ELECTION ZIMBABWE 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS THE M. D. C. 
DIDN'T WIN ENOUGH TO UNSEAT 
PRESIDENT MUGABE 
NORTH OF THE BORDER IT IS A YEAR 
SINCE THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY 
CAME TO POWER SO HOW STRONG IS THE 
UNION AND HOW SHOULD BRITAIN DEAL 
WITH THE WORLD'S RISING SUPERPOWER 
CHINA WHERE THERE ARE NO ELECTIONS 
WE WILL HEAR FROM CHINESE PEOPLE 
HEAR WHO SAYS THE WEST DOESN'T 
UNDERSTAND THEIR COUNTRY CHINA CHINA WANTS TO CATCH UP TO MEET WITH THE 
WEST BUT YOU CAN'T EXPECT CHINA TO 
BE ABLE CHANGE OVERNIGHT IT 
TAKES TIME TO CHANGE TO IMPROVE 
ALL THAT IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR IN 
OUR SPECIAL ELECTION NON ELECTION 
PROGRAMME WITH US FOR THE DURATION 
SIR CHRISTOPHER MEYER FORMER 
BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO WASHINGTON 
HE IS HEAD OF THE INDEPENDENT 
POLICE COMPLAINTS COMMISSION PRESS 
COMPLAINTS COMMISSION LET US START 
THIS SUPER DUPER ELECTION SPECIAL 
WITH WHAT IS GOING ON IN ZIMBABWE 
OR WHAT IS NOT GOING ON THERE FOUR 
WEEKS ON FROM THE VOTE THE RESULT 
OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST HAS NOT 
BEEN OFFICIALLY DECLARED 
GOVERNMENT SOURCES ARE SAYING THAT 
THE OPPOSITION LEAD E. MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI DID DEFEAT ROBERT MUGABE 
BUT NOT BY A WIDE ENOUGH MARGIN TO 
AVOID A RUN OFF SO IT IS STILL 
UNCERTAIN AND SOMETHING OF A MESS 
IS NOT THE TRUTH OF THE SITUATION 
IS THAT ROBERT MUGABE IS 
MANOEUVREING OVER TIME TO STAY IN 
POWER REGARDLESS OF THE RESULT OF 
THE ELECTION AND THERE IS NOTHING 
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT 
GOT IT IN ONE I 
THINK I THINK THAT IS RIGHT SO 
LONG AS HE HAS THE LOYALTY OF ARMIR 
RY AND THE POLICE FORCE MOST OF 
WHICH AS FAR AS I CAN SEE IS PAID 
FOR BY FOREIGN POWERS LIKE CHINA 
HE WILL SURVIVE AND PRESSURE FROM 
HIS PEERS ELSEWHERE IN AFRICA 
PARTICULARLY SOUTH AFRICA I THINK 
ARE BEST AT BEST IS PRETTY FEEBLE 
WITHOUT THAT PRESSURE AND HE IS NOT 
BEEN GETTING IT THERE IS VERY 
LITTLE HE NEED DO AND ARE WE RIGHT 
IN ASSUMING PROBABLY ONE MORNING WE 
WILL MAKE WAKE UP AND FIND THE 
OPPOSITION LEADERS HAVE BEEN 
ROUNDED UP AND THROWN IN THE SLAERM 
I DON'T THINK WE WOULD DO THAT I 
THINK HE IS TOO CLEVER DO THAT HE 
DUS PREPRESS TORTURE AND VIELINESS 
I DON'T THINK HE WOULD GO FAR 
BECAUSE THAT WOULD STRAIN THE 
LOYALTY OF HIS COUSINS FURTHER 
SOUTH INTERESTING GOOD TO HAVE 
TO ENTER GO TO THE WEBSITE AT THE 
END OF THE SHOW SIR CHRISTOPHER 
MEYER WILL GIVE US THE CORRECT 
ANSWER AND IF YOU WANT TO SEND US 
YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT ANY OF THE 
STORIES GET E. MAILING WE WILL READ 
SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS OUT LATER IN 
THE SHOW NOW AS YOU KNOW IT IS 
ELECTION DAY AND AIM SURE MANY OF 
YOU WILL HAVE BEEN UP AT THE CRACK 
OF DAWN TO GET TO THE POLL HERE IS 
A REMINDER OF WHAT IS HAPPENING 
TODAY IN ENGLAND AND WALES THERE 
ARE FOUR THOUSAND SEATS UP FOR GRABS ON ONE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE 
COUNCILS MOST WERE LAST CONTESTED 
IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND IN LONDON MAYORAL AND 
ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS ARE TAKING PLACE 
NOW THE LAST TIME THESE COUNCIL 
SEATS WERE CONTESTED THE TURN OUT 
WAS JUST OVER FORTY PER CENT LET US TALK TO 
OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT JAMES 
LANDALE WHO IS OUT THERE IN 
WESTMINSTER GOOD MORNING JAMES 
NOW RAIN HOLDING OFF WILL THAT 
AFFECT THE TURN OUT DO YOU THINK IN 
A HUGE NUMBER OF FACTORS AFFECT IT 
WHETHER WE HAVE SHOWERS THAT IS 
SAID TO HAVE AN IMPACT WHO IT 
HELPS AND HINDER THAT IS A MATTER 
FOR DEBATE ALSO THE PARTIES 
THEMSELVES WILL BE OUT THERE 
WORKING VERY HARD AT THE MOMENT TO 
GET THEIR VOTERS OUT BECAUSE 
OBVIOUSLY TURN OUT MATTERS IN ALL 
OF THESE ELECTION AT THE END OF 
THE DAY THEY HAVE THE MAKE SURE 
PEOPLE CAST THEIR VOTES IT IS NOT 
ENOUGH TO HAVE PEOPLE SAYING WE ARE 
GOING TO SUPPORT YOU THAT IS THE 
FOCUS TURN OUT IN THESE ELECTIONS 
MAYORAL ELECTION LOCAL ELECTIONS 
TEND TO BE ROUND THE LATE THIRTIES 
OCCASIONALLY THE FORTY MARK THAT 
DOUBLES WHEN YOU GET TO A GENERAL 
ELECTION BUT YES LOTS OF WORK 
GOING ON AS WE SPEAK 
WHAT ABOUT 
THE LONDON AND MAYORAL ELECTION A 
BIT MORE COMPLICATED PEOPLE HAVE A 
NUMBER OF BALLOT PAPERS TO FILL IN 
AN EMBARASSMENT OF RICHES YOU CAN 
CAST FOUR VOTES IN LONDON ON THREE 
SEPARATE BALLOT PAPERS FIRST OF 
ALL YOU HAVE YOUR CHOICES FOR 
LONDON MAYOR YOU CAN HAVE TWO 
VOTES THERE YOUR FIRST CHOICE AND 
SECOND THEN YOU VOTE FOR THE 
ASSEMBLY THE LABEL TWENTY FIVE MEN AND 
WOMEN WHO ARE THERE TO KEEP AN EYE 
ON WHAT THE MAYOR IS OR IS NOT 
DOING AND YOU VOTE YOU HAVE TWO 
VOITH VOTE ONE FOR YOUR 
CONSTITUENCY AND ONE VOTE FOR THE 
PARTY YOU FAVOUR AS WHOLE WITHIN 
LONDON THEN THERE IS A COMPLEX 
MECHANISM INVENTED BY A BELGIAN WHO 
ESTABLISHES AND MAKE SURES THAT ALL 
THE VOTES CAST ARE AS BASICALLY AS 
MORE AS PROPORTIONATE AS POSSIBLE 
TO HOW VOTERS HAVE VOTED AS A WHOLE COURSE ONLY 
HE WOULD KNOW THERE WAS A BELGIAN 
BEHIND IT L. GOT FOUR BALLOT PAPERS 
REMINDED ME OF BEING IN BELFAST IN 
THE OLD DAYS WHEN YOU COULD VOTE 
EARLY AND OFTEN IT IS EXACTLY A 
YEAR SINCE THE SCOTTISH 
PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS WHEN THE 
SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY CAME TO 
POWER IN EDINBURGH IN A MINORITY 
ADMINISTRATION WE CAN TALK ABOUT 
THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE NO ELECTION 
IN SCOTLAND TODAY RECENT POLLS 
SHOW THAT THE LEADER OF THE 
SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY ALEX 
SALMOND REMAINS POPULAR WITH THE 
SCOTTISH PEOPLE BUT THESE PEOPLE 
ALSO REMAIN TO BE CONVINCED ABOUT 
THE CASE FOR INDEPENDENCE 
SEPARATION IS STILL THE LONG TERM 
GOAL WHAT IS THE STATE OF THE THREE HUNDRED 
YEAR OLD UNION BETWEEN SCOTLAND AND 
ENGLAND TODAY WE WILL TALK TO ONE 
OF THE PARTIES WESTMINSTER M. P.'S IN A 
MOMENT BUT FIRST JO HAS THIS 
REMINDER THIS TIME LAST YEAR THE 
SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY AND THE 
LABOUR PARTY WERE IN THE FIGHT OF 
THEIR POLITICAL LIVES OVER CONTROL 
OF THE PARLIAMENT IN EDINBURGH THE 
S. N. P. WON THE ELECTION BY ONE SEAT 
AND ALEX SALMOND ALEX SALMOND 
BECAME FIRST MINISTER SINCE THEN 
THEY HAVE BROUGHT IN POLICIES THAT 
HAVE BEEN POPULAR THIS HAS LED TO 
HIGH PERSONAL APPROVAL RATINGS FOR 
ALEX SALMOND AND HIS GOVERNMENT 
HOWEVER THEY WILL HAVE A BATTLE ON 
THEIR HANDS TO GET THEIR MORE 
CONTROVERSIAL PLANS THROUGH SUCH AS 
SCRAPPING COUNCIL TAX AND A BILL TO 
ALLOW THEM TO HOLD A REFERENDUM ON 
INDEPENDENCE MOST MANIFESTO 
COMMITMENT AND FIERCELY OPPOSED BY 
THE OTHER PARTIES BETWEEN 
WESTMINSTER AND HOLYROOD THE 
POLITICAL TUG OF WAR HAS CONTINUED 
RELATIONS BETWEEN GORDON AND ALEX 
HAVE BEEN POOR AND THERE HAVE BEEN 
BIG TUSSLES OVER THE SIZE OF THE 
BUDGET ALLOCATED TO SCOTLAND BY 
WHITEHALL WITH GROWING CALLS TO 
READJUST THE EXTRA SUBSIDY THAT 
WORKS OUT AT FIFTEEN HUNDRED MORE PER PERSON 
IN SCOTLAND THAN IN ENGLAND WELL 
WITH CALLS FROM SOME TORYS FOR 
ENGLISH M. P.'S TO TO BE ALLOWED TO 
VOTE ON LAWS AFFECTING ENGLAND IN 
THE FUTURE THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID 
IT WILL FIGHT TO KEEP THE UNION 
INTACT DESPITE A GROWING DEBATE 
ABOUT WHETHER IT IS TIME FOR 
ENGLAND TO LET GO OF SCOTLAND 
FOREVER FOREVER NOTHING IS FOREVER JO BUT WE ARE 
WITH ANGUS ROBERTSON WOULD BE 
TESTIFY S. N. P. WESTMINSTER M. P.'S 
WELCOME TO THE DAILY POLITICS 
EXPLAIN TO OUR VIEWER PARTICULARLY 
THOSE SOUTH OF THE BORED HOW IS 
THE SITUATION WHERE THE LATEST POLL 
SHOWS THAT ALEX SALMOND IS RATHER 
POPULAR AS FIRST MINISTER BUT THAT 
THE CASE FOR INDEPENDENCE HASN'T 
INCREASED ONE BIT SINCE THE S. N. P. 
CAME TO POWER 
I THINK YOU ARE 
REFERRING TO ONE POLL THAT APPEARED 
IN ONE NEWSPAPER THIS WEEK AND NOT 
THE POLL LAST WEEK THAT SHOW ASKED 
THE QUESTION THAT IS PROPOSED THERE 
WOULD BE A MAJORITY IN FAVOUR WHAT 
IS BEYOND DISPUTE IS THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT IN SCOTLAND IS VERY 
POPULAR THE FIRST MINISTER IS VERY 
POPULAR THAT THERE ARE IS 
OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FOR THE PUBLIC 
HAVING A SAY IN THIS AND THE S. N. P. 
THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT WANTS 
PEOPLE TO HAVE THAT SAY IN A 
REFERENDUM AND WE TRUST THAT THE 
PEOPLE WILL COME TO THE RIGHT 
DECISION WE BELIEVE IT WILL BE 
INDEPENDENCE 
WHY DON'T YOU CALL A INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM 
WE ARE GOING TO WE ARE REFERENDUM PRESENT AGO BILLITON SCOTTISH 
PARLIAMENT IT WILL BE BROUGHT 
FORWARD WITHIN THIS PARLIAMENTARY 
TERM AND DEPEND ON THE ARITHMETIC 
IN THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT THE S. N. P. 
RUNS A MIE BLORTY GOVERNMENT SO OUR 
ABILITY TO HOLD A REFERENDUM IS 
RESTRAINED BY THE U. K. PARTIES THAT 
ARE NOT IN FAVOUR OF HAVING THE 
RIGHT TO EXERCISE THEIR CHOICE 
WOULDN'T IT SUIT YOU TO SEE THE 
MAIN UNIONIST PARTIES VOTING 
AGAINST A REFERENDUM DENYING THE 
SCOTTISH PEOPLE A SAY WOULDN'T 
THAT PLAY TO YOUR TACTICS 
WHAT IS 
MORE SIGNIFICANT AND YOU ARE 
ASKING ME TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WHO 
ARE NOT ABLE TO FOLLOW THE 
INTRICACIES OF THIS ALL THE OTHER 
PARTIES ARE AGREED THE SCOTTISH 
PARLIAMENT SHOULD HAVE MORE POWERS 
THAT IS A HUGE TRANSFORMATION THEY 
HAVE ALL DECLARED THEY WANT MORE 
POWERS FOR THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT 
AND THAT WASN'T THE CASE LAST YEAR 
SO WITHIN ONE SHORT YEAR OF BEING 
IN POWER THE S. N. P. IS HELPING MOVE 
THE AGENDA FORWARD IT IS WHAT THE 
PUBLIC IS IN FAVOUR OF AND WE 
TRUST THE PEOPLE TO MAKE THAT 
DECISION 
NOT BY THAT MUCH IN DECISION YESTERDAY'S YOWE GOV POLL WHICH WAS 
A PET PRETTY BIG POLL WHEN GIVEN 
THREE ALTERNATIVES THIRTY FOUR PER CENT SAID YES 
PARLIAMENT WITH GREATER POWER THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT 
THAT IS NOT MUCH MORE FOUR POINTS 
WHEN ASKED OUTRIGHT INDEPENDENCE 
ONLY TWENTY THREE PER CENT SO BASICALLY ONLY ONE IN 
FIVE PEOPLE GIVEN A CHOICE OF THREE 
WOULD COME OUT FOR YOUR PARTY'S 
LINE WHY IS THAT 
THAT IS NOT OUR 
LINE THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED 
IS NOT THE QUESTION THAT WOULD BE 
ASKED 
THEOUT COME IS THE SAME YOU ASKED MIGHT NOT LIKE TO PHRASE IT THAT 
WAY BUT THAT 
IS YOUR POLICY THAT THAT IS THE POINT ONE AM TRYING TO MAKE 
IT IS NOT THE QUESTION THAT WOULD 
BE ASKED ON THE BALLOT PAPER IT 
THE QUESTION THE QUESTION IS A 
SENSITIVE ISSUE AND THE POLLING I 
PREFER AS YOU KNOW I RAN THE 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN FOR THE SCOTTISH 
PARLIAMENT LAST YEAR AND ONE OF 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT 
THAT WAS THE TRENDS THAT WERE 
GOING ON NOT ONE POLL UP ONE POLL 
DOWN WHAT IS THE TREND AND THE 
TRENDS IN SCOTTISH POLITICS ARE 
THERE IS THE S. N. P. HAS INCREASED ITS 
LEAD OVER THE OTHER PARTY THE 
FIRST MINISTER HAS INCREASED HIS 
POPULARITY 
I UNDERSTAND THAT POPULARITY PUBLIC OPINION IS IN FAVOUR OF A 
REFERENDUM AND WE TRUST THE PEOPLE 
TO DECIDE IF THE OTHER PARTIES 
HAVE PROBLEM WITH THAT LET US HAVE A REFERENDUM 
BUT YOU ARE IN 
FAVOUR OF A COMPLETELY SEPARATE 
STATE OUTSIDE THE U. K. THAT IS YOUR 
PARTY'S POLL SIFPLTS WE ARE IN 
FAVOUR OF INDEPENDENCE IN THE 
EUROPEAN UNION THAT IS WHAT THAT 
MEANS 
IN 
THE POLL THEY SAID WITHIN MEANS THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT LET ME ASK 
YOU THIS IF YOU GOT A REFERENDUM 
WOULD IT BE SIMPLY YES NO TO 
INDEPENDENCE OR WOULD YOU GIVE 
PEOPLE THE OPTION OF A STRONGER 
PARLIAMENT WITHIN THE U. K. OUR 
PREFERENCE FIRST PLEF RENS IS A 
STRAIGHT QUESTION ON INDEPENDENCE 
BUT WE RECOGNISE THAT THERE IS A 
STRONG BODY OF OPINION IN SCOTLAND 
THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE POWER 
TO THE PARLIAMENT SHORT OF 
INDEPENDENCE SO WE SAID WE WOULD BE 
QUITE HAPPY TO HAVE A MULTI OPTION 
REFERENDUM THAT WOULD HAVE THE 
STATUS QUO THAT WOULD HAVE THE 
OPTION THAT IS CONSIDERED BY THE 
STRONGER PARLIAMENT AND 
INDEPENDENCE WE THINK THAT IS THE 
RIGHT WAY TO GO 
MAYBE YOUR BEST 
HOPE IS TO DO WHAT ALEX SALMOND IS 
GOOD AT AND PROVOKE AN ENGLISH 
BACKLASH 
SHOWING WHAT YOU ARE BACKLASH DOING IS SENSIBLE AND IS POPULAR 
AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING IN 
SCOTLAND THAT IS WHY I AM VERY 
CONFIDENT WHEN WE GET TO THE STAGE 
WE CAN HOLD A REFERENDUM WE WILL 
WIN THAT REFERENDUM BUT IT IS AN 
ODD SITUATION THAT THOSE WHO ARGUE 
AGAINST INDEPENDENCE AREN'T 
PREPARED TO PUT THE QUESTION 
SURELY THEY SHOULD HAVE THE COURAGE 
OF THEIR CONVICTION 
AND CALL YOUR 
BLUFF 
IF THEY WANT TO DESCRIBE IT BLUFF AS CALLING OUR BLUFF L. AM HAPPY TO 
HAVE IT ANY TIME 
ALEX SALMOND WHO 
IS POPULAR NORTH OF THE BORDER FOR 
THE MOMENT ANY WAY CAN YOU EXPLAIN 
TO THE PEOPLE SOUTH OF THE BORDER 
HE IS STILL AN M. P. IN WE WESTMINSTER 
HOW COME HE HAS MANAGED TO CLAIM 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN THOUSAND IN WESTMINSTER EXPENSES 
HAS ONLY MADE SIX VISIT S. TO 
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN THE LAST 
YEAR 
LIKE THE FIRST MINISTER OF YEAR NORTHERN IRELAND ALEX SALMOND COMES 
FOR IMPORTANT VOTE AND I THINK 
THAT IS RIGHT AND PROPER HE DOES 
THAT HE SAID HE IS GOING TO STAND 
DOWN FROM WESTMINSTER AT THE NEXT 
U. K. ELECTION BUT UNTIL THAT TIME HE 
IS DOING 
WHY IS HE CLAIMING SO 
MUCH WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE HE IS 
MEANT TO REPRESENT FROM THAT 
CONSTITUENCY IN WESTMINSTER THEY 
ARE BEING SHORT CHANGED 
I DON'T 
THINK SO IF YOU GO TO THE 
CONSTITUENCIES AND YOU ASK THEIR 
OPINION OF HOW HE IS DOING PUBLIC 
OPINION IS OVERWHELMING AND IT IS 
POSITIVE 
ALL RIGHT SCOTTISH POSITIVE INDEPENDENCE IS IT GOING TO HAPPEN 
IN YOUR VIEW IT MAY HAPPEN AND IF 
IN YOUR VIEW IT DOES I WON'T BE THE END OF THE 
WORLD I WOULD PREFER TO KEEP THE 
UNION BUT I THINK IF GORDON BROWN 
SAID TOMORROW TO ALEX SALMOND YOU 
CAN HAVE INDEPENDENCE NEXT WEEK I 
THINK THE S. N. P. WOULD RUN SCREAMING 
FROM THE ROOM BECAUSE IT SUITS THEM 
TO BE PUSHES AGAINST WHAT APPEARS 
TO BE A MAJORITY 
HE DOESN'T LOOK 
LIKE HE 
IS SCREAMING SILENTLY HE HE IS SCREAMING SILENTLY IT IS LIKE A 
DOG WHISTLE IT IS PENETRATING 
WELL I THINK IT IS IT SUITS THEM 
TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE THEY ARE 
PUSHING AGAINST A MAJORITY POSITION 
I THINK IT HELPS DEFINE THEM AS A 
POLITICAL FORCE IN SCOTLAND AND THE 
U. K. 
WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE 
AM I U. K. TOO CYNICAL L. DON'T KNOW PERRICK PERRICK PERISH THE THOUGHT YOU A 
DIPLOMAT 
I USED TO BE THINK OF DIPLOMAT YOU AS BEING DIPLOMATIC COMPARED 
TO ME 
HOW SHOULD BRITAIN DEAL WITH CHINA 
THE WEST BELIEVES IN DEMOCRACY 
HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH 
BUT CHINA TAKES DIFFERENT VIEW 
AND RESENTS THE CRITICISM OF ITS 
TREATMENT OF TIBET THERE ARE NO 
ELECTIONS THERE BUT WE WILL 
DISCUSS DIPLOMACY WITH CHRISTOPHER 
MEYER FIRST BUT BUT FIRST SOME 
VIEWS FROM CHINA THIS IS THE 
MARTIAL ART WHICH IS PRACTICED TO 
HELP CLEANSE THE BODY AND MIND IT 
IS A POPULAR CLASS FOR OLDER 
CHINESE PEOPLE WHO USE THE 
FACILITIES IN THE HEART OF LONDON'S 
CHINA TOWN TO HELP KEEP IN TOUCH 
WITH THEIR CULTURE 
IN HONG KONG 
AND MAYBE IN CHINA MANY THINGS IS 
CONTROLLED BUT HERE IT IS NOTLET 
YOU CAN TALK WHAT YOU WANT YOU CAN 
THINK WHAT YOU WANT 
THE CHINESE 
RESPECT ALL PEOPLE THEY TEACH IT 
THE CHIN WHEN DELAY YOUNG TO 
RESPECT THEIR PARENTS AND OLD 
PEOPLE 
THE ENGLISH THEY ARE PEOPLE TOLERANT AND OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THE 
CHINESE CULTURE THEY ARE SENSITIVE 
A BIT OF STRONG LANGUAGE OR THAT 
IT MAY AFFECT THEM 
FOR MOST OF THE 
PEOPLE HERE THE CHINA THEY LEFT 
YEARS AGO HAS CHANGED AND IT IS A 
NEW SUPERPOWER THAT STATUS HAS 
THRONE THE SPOTLIGHT ON THE COUNTRY 
THROWN THE SPOTLIGHT ON THE 
COUNTRY THAT INCLUDES THE HUMAN 
RIGHTS RECORD BUT ARE COUNTRIES 
LIKE THE U. K. DEALING WITH CHINA IN 
THE RIGHT WAY 
WE ARE NOT SAYING 
THE U. K. CUSTOM IS WRONG BUT WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT A DIFFERENCE IN 
CULTURE WE YOU HAVE TO 
UNDERSTAND THE CULTURE BEFORE YOU 
CAN SAY WHAT IS DEMOCRACY THE 
BASIC DEMOCRACIES TO BE ABLE TO 
LIVE TO EAT NOT THE STARVE 
DO YOU 
THINK ENOUGH CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN 
TO CULTURAL DIFFERENCES TWEN YOU 
HAVE GOT COUNTRY LIKE THE U. K. 
DEALING WITH CHINA 
I DON'T THINK 
SO PEOPLE ARE IGNORANT OF CHINA 
ON THE GLOBAL STAGE CHINA IS WHERE 
THE U. K. AND THE STATES WERE MANY 
DECADES AGO SO YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT 
SINGLING THEM OUT WE ARE DEALING 
WITH THESE ISSUES IT IS A FOLKAL 
POINT BECAUSE OF WHAT HAS BEEN 
HAPPENING THE OLYMPICS AND THE 
RELAY 
IN ENGLAND YOU SAY YOU 
CAN RELAY CAN SAY WHAT YOU LIKE IF YOU TRY 
THAT IF YOU TRY TO ADVOCATE 
LOCKING UP THE SUICIDE POM BOMBERS 
AND THE ARMY OUTSIDE MOSQUE THEY 
WILL MAKE IT A CRIMINAL OFFENCE FOR 
THOSE WHO EXPRESS THEIR T. N. OPINION 
I'M NOT SAYING THAT IS CORRECT BUT 
IT IS A FREEDOM OF SPEECH IT IS 
GIVING ATE PRICE CHINA WANTS TO 
CAMP UP WITH THE WEST BUT YOU 
CAN'T EXPECT CHINA TO CHANGE 
OVERNIGHT 
THE OLYMPICS LESS THAN OVERNIGHT HUNDRED DAYS AWAY FOR SOME IN THE 
WEST T. TIME IS NOW FOR MORE CHANGE 
IN CHINA IT MAY BE THAT GREATER 
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE TWO 
COUNTRIES GAINED DURING THE RUN UP 
TO GAMES COULD INFORM FUTURE 
DIPLOMACY LET'S TALK TO SIR 
CHRISTOPHER MEYER CHINA SEEMS TO 
BE A DIP HE MATTICK HEADACHE HOW 
SHOULD BRITAIN DEAL WITH THEM THE THE REALITY IS WE PREACH A GOSPEL IN 
OUR FOREIGN POLICY THAT ELEVATES 
HUMAN RIGHTS VERY HIGH BUT THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RHETORIC AND THE 
REALITY IS ENORMOUS THE REALITY 
NEVER LIVES UP TO THE RHETORIC NOW 
IT IS NEVER GOING TO BE THE CASE 
THAT BRITISH FOREIGN POLICY WILL 
MAIG ITS TOP POLICY THE PROP GAIION 
OF HUMAN RIGHTSS IN CHINA WE HAVE 
TOO MUCH INVESTED THERE TOO MANY 
JOINT VENTURES AND TOO MUCH CHINESE 
MONEY IN THE U. K. 
ARE YOU ADVOCATING 
A MORE CONCILIATORY APPROACH AND 
THINK ABOUT IT IN GLOBAL TERMS I'M I'M NOT SAYING WE SHOULD BE 
CONCILIATORY OR COW TOWING WE HAVE 
TO MAKE A FUNDAMENTAL DECISION DO 
WE TAKE THE WORLD AS WE FIND IT OR 
AS WE WOULD WISH ITS TO BE WE HAVE 
VIRTUALLY NO LEVERAGE IN CHINA 
THERE ARE PEOPLE PUBLIC EXPECTS 
SOME STAND GORDON BROWN HAS MADE 
IT BY SAYING HE WON'T ATTEND THE 
OPENING SER MEN MOANY IS THAT 
ENOUGH CEREMONY IS THAT 
ENOUGH 
BRUFPLT WOULD NOT SAY ENOUGH BECAUSE OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS 
PROBLEMS GORDON BROWN HE WOULD 
GO FOR THE CONCLUDESING CEREMONY 
IS IT THE 
RIGHT THING TO DO THE THE RIGHT THING TO DO WITH CHINA IS 
ACCEPT THE LIMITATIONS ON YOUR 
ABILITIES TO CHANGE ANYTHING THERE 
WE HAVE VERY LIMITED POWERS AND 
FRANKLY I THINK WE SHOULD GET ON 
WITH THE BUSINESS OF DEALING WITH 
CHINA 
IT IS NOT WORTH TRYING TO CHINA GET CONCESSIONS 
WHAT WOULD THEY 
BE OCCASIONALLY IF YOU ARE ARE IN 
UNITED STATES YOU CAN SPRING A 
DISSIDENT BECAUSE IT HAPPENED TO 
COINCIDE WITH A VISIT BY AN 
AMERICAN PRESIDENT YOU DO THAT AS 
WE DID WITH THE SOVIET UNION BUT 
LOCK STOCK AND BARREL CHANGING 
THE CHINESE SYSTEM AND PUTTING IN A 
CHINESE MICHAEL MARTIN IN THE 
COMMONS 
WITH THE OLYMPICS AND THE COMMONS WORLD STAGE DON'T YOU THINK THERE 
IS A BIT MORE LEVERAGE THERE YES YES THERE ARE BITS OF LEVERAGE AROUND 
BUT IT IS FITFUL INEFFECTIVE AND 
ONE THING PEOPLE FORGET IT IS A 
PHENOMENONALLY NATIONALISTIC 
COUNTRY IT HAS A DEEP AND BURNING 
RESENTMENT ABOUT THE WAY IT 
CONSIDERS ITS BADLY TREATED BY THE 
WEST IN THE LATE NINETEENTH AND EARLY 
TWENTIETH CENTURY F. YOU PUSH TOO HARD 
YOU WILL GET A REACTION THAT WILL 
MAKE THINGS WORSE IT MAY SOUND 
FEEBLE OR CYNICAL BUT THAT IS THE 
REALITY THAT IS THE WAY OF THE 
WORLD 
THANK YOU WE WILL SEE HOW WORLD MUCH LEVERAGE WE HAVE BY SEPTEMBER 
WHEN THE GAMES ARE OVER NOW 
CONTINUING WITH THE ELECTION THEME 
IT IS GOING WELL WHAT IS THE 
LATEST FROM THE UNITED STATES RACE 
BARACK OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON 
ARE STILL ON THE TRAIL AS THE 
BATTLE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC 
NOMINATION MOVES TO PRIMARYS IN 
INDIANA AND NORTH CAROLINA THE 
CONTEST IS SO CLOSE IT IS CERTAIN 
THAT THE OUTCOME WILL DEPENDS ON 
THE VOTES OF SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY FIVE MEMBERS OF THE 
PARTY ELITE THE SUPERDELEGATES 
THEY WILL MEET AT THE DEMOCRATIC 
CONVENTION IN DENVER IN AUGUST IN 
THE ROCKY MOWN STATE BARACK 
OBAMA IS EXPECTED TO WIN THE VOTES 
OF THE THE ELECTED DEL GATES BUT 
HILLARY CLINTON HAS SUPPORT FROM 
THE BIG STATE THERE IS A THE 
DEMOCRATS 
HAVE TO WIN JOINING ME 
NOW IS STEPHANIE CUTTER WHO WAS 
JOHN KERRY'S SPOKESMAN AND WORKED 
FOR BILL CLINTON WHEN HE WAS 
PRESIDENT NOW THIS WAS SUPPOSE TO 
BE THE DEMOCRATS' YEAR AFTER IT IT STILL IT 
SO HOW COME YOU HAVE GOT 
INTO A POSITION WHERE HILLARY 
CLINTON CANNOT WIN A MAJORITY OF 
THE ELECTED DELEGATES AND BARACK 
OBAMA IS NOW DAMAGED GOODS 
I WOULD 
DISAGREE WITH YOU ABOUT DAMAGED 
GOODS THIS HAS BEEN A PROCESS OF 
STRENGTHENING THE DERMIC PARTY WE 
HAVE TWO HISTORIC CANDIDATES 
RUNNING FOR NAMNOIION 
NOMINATION 
RIPPING EACH OTHERS' NOMINATION THROATS OUT 
I THINK THAT IS AN 
OVERSTATEMENT 
ALL RIGHT OVERSTATEMENT SCRATCHING THEIR EYES OUT 
ON A 
DAILY BASIS AS THEY GO THROUGH THE 
AREAS THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT 
THEY WANT TO CHANGE ABOUT THE 
ECONOMY AWAY FROM BUSH'S POLICIES 
THESE ARE THINGS THAT MATTER TO 
VOTERS NOT THIS REVERENT WRIGHT 
STUFF 
IT MATTERED ENOUGH FOR STUFF BARACK OBAMA TO HAVE TO CHANGE HIS 
POSITION THREE TIMES ON THE REV 
RENT WRIGHT 
THAT IS BECAUSE HE HE SAID HE COULD MORE DISOWN THIS MAN 
THAN DISOWN HIS FAMILY NOW HE HAS 
DISOWNED HIM 
THEN REVEREND WRIGHT 
GAVE A DIVISIVE SPEECH F. A MEMBER 
OF YOUR FAMILY PROVOKED YOU IN THAT 
WAY YOU WOULD HAVE MADE SIMILAR 
REMARKS 
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MY FAMILY REMARKS THE REVEREND WRIGHT LOOK LIKE 
HEAVEN COMPARED TO THEM 
LIKE ANY 
AMERICAN HE WAS FDED OCHEDED HE 
MADE THAT CLEAR 
OFFENDED WHY 
DID HE SIT IN THIS CHURCH FOR 
TWENTY YEARS 
HE SAID THESE WERE 
NOT THE REMARKS OF REVEREND WRIGHT 
THAT HE KNEW WHAT HE DID ON 
TUESDAY AND IN MAKING CLEAR HE DID 
NOT ADEGREE WITH AGREE WITH REFR 
RENDS WRIGHT HE SHOWED THE PEOPLE 
THAT YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE SUERN 
DELEGATES WHO WOMEN F. R. COME OFF 
THE FENCE AFTER LAST CONTEST AND 
MAKE THE DECISION OF WHO WILL BE 
OUR NOMINEE HE MADE IT CLEAR HE 
WON'T ALLOW THESE ATTACKS TO HAPPEN 
HE WILL MAKE ITS CLEAR TO VOTERS 
THAT HE HAS HIS OWN OPINIONS ABOUT 
WHERE OUR COUNTRY SHOULD GO IF 
THEY DON'T AGREE WITH REFR REND 
WRIGHT 
IF HILLARY CLINTON OR IF WRIGHT BARACK OBAMA IS STILL AHEAD IN THE 
ELECTED DELEGATE COUNT AFTER THE 
JUNE THIRD PRIMARIES SHOULD HILLARY 
CLINTON STAND DOWN 
I THINK THAT 
THE MATH WILL BE CLEAR AFTER JUNE 
THIRD ONE PERSON WILL BE AHEAD WITH 
THE PLENGED PLEDGED DELEGATES 
THAT WILL BE BARACK OBAMA HE WILL 
BE AHEAD WITH THE POPULAR VOTE IT 
WOULD BE KIFT FOR DIFFICULT FOR 
SUPERDELEGATES TO OVERTURN THE WILL 
OF THE PEOPLE IF HE IS CLEARLY 
AHEAD HE IS THE WINNER OF THE PR 
PROCESS WE HAVE THIS FUNNY SYSTEM 
WHERE SUPER DELEGATES CAN MAKE 
THEIR OPINION KNOWN 
A STRANGE 
THING FOR A DEMOCRATIC PARTY BUT 
SHOULD HILLARY CLINTON STAND DOWN 
I'M NOT IN POSITION TO TELL HER 
WHAT TO DO 
I WAS ASKING FOR YOUR 
OPINION SHE SHOULD IGNORE IT WE WE HAVE TO DO WHAT IS BEST FOR THE 
PARTY AND THAT IS TO PUT THE 
STRONGEST PERSON FORWARD AND THAT 
IS MOST LIELY TO BE THE VICTOR OF 
THE PRIMARY CONTEST 
AS YOU SCRATCH 
EACH OTHERS' EYES OUT YOU GAVE 
SENATOR MCCAIN THE REPUBLICAN 
CANDIDATE ELECT A GET OUT OF JAIL 
CARD HE IS WALKING AROUND SELLING 
HIS BOOK MEETING BLUE COLLAR 
WORKERS AND RAISING A TONNE OF 
MONEY 
AE HE IS NOT TURNING ANYBODY MONEY TO HIS SIDE JUST IN THE MONTHS OF 
MARCH HILLARY CLINTON AND BARACK 
OBAMA RAISED THREE TIMES AS MUCH AS 
JOHN MCCAIN WE ARE TURNING OUT 
MILLIONS OF NEW VOTERS THAT ISOLA 
THIS IS ABOUT THAT IS WHAT THE 
PROCESS IS ABOUT JOHN MCCAIN'S 
DAYS PROFRLS ARE TEN PERCENTAGE 
IS THE APPROVALS ARE TEN PER CEN 
TADGE POINTS HIGHER THAN A MONTH 
AGO HE IS TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY 
AND NOBODY IS BUYING IT 
YOU KNOW A 
BIT ABOUT AMERICAN POLITICS HAVING 
BEEN IN THAT EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON 
THAT WE HAVE TO SHELL OUT FOR I'M I'M A TAXPAYER 
YOU GOT TO LIVE THERE 
I'M ONLY TAEZING IF YOU WERE JOHN 
MCCAIN YOU WANT TO WIN WHO WOULD 
YOU ARE THER BE UP AGAINST HILLARY 
CLINTON OR BARACK OBAMA 
IT IS A 
DIFFERENT CALCULATION FOR JOHN 
MCCAIN ONE THING STEPHANIE CUTTER 
SAID IS RIGHTS IT IS SURPRISING 
HOW LITTLE EXTRA TRACTION JOHN 
MCCAIN IS GETTING ALTHOUGH THE 
DEMOCRATS ARE TEARING THEIR EYES 
OUT THERE WAS A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY 
THERE AND JOHN MCCAIN DID NOT DO 
WELL CAN I PUT THIS THE OTHER WAY 
AROUND I THINK THE BIG BIG 
CHALLENGE FOR THE SUPERGEL 
DELEGATES WHICH WILL WITH P. WORK 
OUT WHICH OF THE DERMS WILL HAVE 
THE BEST CHANCE OF BEATING JOHN 
MCCAIN IF IT IS CLOSE THAT WILL BE 
THE DECISIVE POINT
