OH RIGHT 
DO YOU WANT YOUR HAEMORRHOID OINTMENT YES 
FASCIST 
HELLO HOW MANY ONE 
REALLY YEAH 
WE CAME FROM A VERY TRADITIONAL COMMUNITY SO WE'VE HAD LOTS OF PRESSURES THROUGHOUT OUR MARRIAGE 
WHAT SORT OF PRESSURES WELL THE HARDEST THING FOR ME WELL FOR US 
IS THE TRADITION OF NO SEX FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF MARRIAGE 
IS THAT REY A TRADITION 
YES 
HOORAY 
HI REMEMBER US THE DELHI STUDENTS ONLY NOW WE'RE NOT STUDENTS ANY MORE WE'VE GRADUATED 
YES I'M AN ACCOUNTANT WAITING TO START WORK IN MY FATHER'S BUSINESS 
I'M A LAWYER WAITING TO START WORK IN MY FATHER'S BUSINESS 
I'M AN ENGINEER WAITING TO START WORK IN MY FATHER'S BUSINESS 
I FAILED ALL MY PAPERS I'M GOING INTO POLITICS HOORAY 
BUT BEFORE WE ALL JOIN THE RAT RACE 
WE WANT TO PUT SOMETHING BACK INTO SOCIETY YES TO HELP THOSE LESS FORTUNATE THAN OURSELVES 
SO WE JOINED THE VOLUNTARY SERVICE OF INDIA HOORAY 
THE PROBLEM FACING ANY V. S. I. WORKER IS DECIDING WHERE TO DO THE MOST GOOD 
YES A LOT OF COUNTRIES NEED HELP LIKE SOUTH AMERICA WHERE THERE ARE SHANTY TOWNS AND STREET URCHINS 
AND AFRICA WITH ITS DROUGHTS AND INADEQUATE HEALTH CARE AND EASTERN EUROPE 
WITH ITS CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE AND STODGY FOOD 
BUT THERE IS ONE COUNTRY WITH THESE PROBLEMS SO WE'VE ALL COME TO HELP OUT HERE IN ENGLAND 
HOORAY 
WE HAVE COME HERE TO A RAMSHACKLE CLINIC IN THE POVERTY STRICKEN VILLAGE OF WOLVERHAMPTON 
THE GOVERNMENTS HAVE NEGLECTED THEIR HEALTH CARE AND NOW FOR THE POOREST HEALTH CARE IS RUDIMENTARY 
IF IT WASN'T FOR PLACES LIKE INDIA AND PAKISTAN THERE WOULD BE NO DOCTORS HERE AT ALL 
ALTHOUGH FOR MOST OF THE YEAR IT RAINS CONTINUOUSLY DURING THE HOT SUMMER MONTH 
THERE ARE DROUGHTS AND WATER IS IN SHORT SUPPLY 
SO WHEN WE SAW THESE POOR GUYS DIGGING A WELL 
WE DECIDED TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND MUCK IN 
IT'S THIRSTY WORK I CAN TELL YOU ARE WE NEARLY THERE YET 
YEAH MATE KEEP DIGGING 
YOU KNOW BRITAIN USED TO BE FAMOUS FOR ITS GREEN AND PLEASANT LANDS 
BUT SADLY NOW MOST OF IT HAS BEEN BOUGHT UP BY BIG FOREIGN COMPANIES 
YES THEY BUILD THEIR FACTORIES HERE 
SO THEY CAN EXPLOIT THE CHEAP LABOUR COSTS TERRIBLE 
SO ANOTHER WAY THAT BRITAIN CAN HELP ITSELF IS TO CASH IN ON THE ECO TOURISM BOOM SWEEPING THE GLOBE 
THAT'S RIGHT GORDON HERE IS A WARDEN HERE 
WE'RE AT ONE OF THE NEW GAME RESERVES EPPING FOREST WOW AND HE'S AGREED TO SHOW US AROUND 
MANY OF ENGLAND'S ENDANGERED SPECIES FIND A HAVEN IN THIS PROTECTED WOODLAND HERE

I PAID FOR MY OWN DINNER 
SLUT 
AFTER THE GAME OF DRAUGHTS CAME A COMMERCIAL DEPARTURE FOR YOU 
HAVING PREVIOUSLY SHUNNED THE USE OF SONG AND DANCE YOU DECIDED IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT THAT IT COULD BE A POWERFUL TOOL 
I REALISED THAT THERE IS A LONG TRADITION OF STORYTELLING THROUGH DANCE 
IN INDIA ONE THINKS OF BHARATANATYAM KHATAK 
IN EUROPE YOU HAVE YOUR CLASSICAL BALLETS LIKE SWAN LAKE GISELLE 
AND IN AMERICA OF COURSE SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER 
WITH JOHN TRAVOLTA 
PRECISELY BUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER 
THAT THE TWO PEOPLE ARE SYMBOLIC AND IN THE BACKGROUND POST PARTITION SOCIETY DECLINES BUT TO A NICE TUNE 
ADULT ILLITERACY IS A MAJOR PROBLEM HERE 
SOME PEOPLE CANNOT EVEN SPEAK ENGLISH 
WE'RE AT A LOCAL EDUCATION CENTRE TO SEE HOW WE CAN HELP HELLO 
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU DID TODAY 
OWT REALLY JUST SUPPED A PINT WITH US MATES DOWN THE BOOZER LIKE 
CHILD LABOUR IS A MAJOR PROBLEM HERE 
AS IN MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
KIDS LIKE LITTLE ERIC HERE HAS TO WORK VERY LONG HOURS IN TERRIBLE CONDITIONS FOR VERY LOW PAY 
WHAT WOULD YOU REALLY LIKE TO DO ERIC 
I'D LIKE TO BE A TEACHER IF I COULD 
AW MAYBE ONE DAY HE'LL REALISE HIS DREAMS 
I HOPE SO 
DO YOU WANT FRIES WITH THAT YES AND TWO MILKSHAKES PLEASE AND HURRY UP 
BUT IT'S NOT ALL DOOM AND GLOOM YOU KNOW 
EVEN IN THESE APPALLING CONDITIONS THE SPIRIT STILL SHINES THROUGH THESE CHILDREN ARE PROOF OF THAT 
HOORAY 
WHERE'S MY WALLET
