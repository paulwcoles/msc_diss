THANKS VERY MUCH OVER TO YOU ROB

CHARTED TERRITORY EXCITED YOU

WEEK THE CAPTAIN ALI CARTER 
WE WILL REVIEW THE OPENING FRAMES 
OF THE O'SULLIVAN ARE VOTERS HENDRY 
SEMI FINAL LATER IN THE COMMENTARY 
BOX FOR THE FIRST SESSION IT IS 
ARE WILLIE THORNE AND JOHN VIRGO 
GOOD EVENING EVERYBODY WHAT AN 
ENTHRALLING ENCOUNTER THIS COULD BE 
WE HAVE GOT TWO YOUNG MEN FIRST 
TIME HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE 
WHEN IT IS DOWN TO THE ONE TABLE 
STAGE IN MY OPINION IT IS THE 
BEST VENUE WE HAVE 
THIS ARENA NOW 
LOOKS LIKE IT IS MADE ESPECIALLY 
FOR SNOOKER NINE HUNDRED SIXTY OF PEOPLE IN THIS 
EVENING WATCHING THESE TWO MEN ARE 
PLAYING IN THEIR FIRST EVER WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP SEMI FINAL A BIG TEST 
FOR THEM BOTH 
IF THAT DOESN'T GIVE 
YOU A LITTLE BIT OF NERVES NOTHING 
WILL BACK TO THE RAFTERS PACKED 
JUST WHAT YOU WOULD BE LOOKING FOR 
A GOOD START BUT TERRIFIC OPENING 
RED FROM ALI CARTER THAT WOULD 
GIVE YOU A FEEL GOOD FACTOR 
MAYBE WORTH THE RISK TAKING THE 
CUT ON WELL WHAT GET TOO MUCH 
AFTER THE SAFETY SHOT WILL NOT 
UNLUCKY LET'S NOT FORGET THAT 
THESE TWO MEN HAVE BEEN ON THE TWO 
TABLES SITUATION IT MAY TAKE THEM 
HALF A FRAME TO GET USED TO THE 
SPEED 
BOTH PLAYERS HAVE POTTED AN OPENING 
RED AT THEIR FIRST OPPORTUNITY 
HE COULD DECIDE TO GO INTO THEM 
HERE IF HE WANTS TO 
JOE IS NOT ONE OF THOSE TYPES OF 
PLAYERS NORMALLY HE LIKES TO PLAY 
FOR THE LOOSE ONES BUT HE HAS DONE 
I LIKE TO SEE THAT 
AND IT HAS 
WORKED OUT QUITE NICELY HE HAS A 
RED TO THE RIGHT CORNER HE TOOK 
THAT OPPORTUNITY AND COULDN'T HAVE 
HIT THE BETTER 
AT THE START OF THIS SEASON JOE 
PERRY WAS RANKED EIGHTEEN IN THE WORLD 
BUT THAT DEPENDING ON HOW WELL HE 
DOES HERE WILL BE MOVING UP A BIT 
HIS OPPONENT ALI CARTER WORLD 
RANKING FOURTEEN PROVISIONAL ELEVEN SO NOT 
MUCH TO CHOOSE FROM BETWEEN THEM ON 
PAPER 
LET'S HOPE THEY BOTH PLAY WELL AND 
U. S. AND MATCH TO REMEMBER GIVE US 
AND MATCH TO REMEMBER 
BECAUSE JOE PERRY PLAYED SO WELL 
YESTERDAY EVENING IN HIS MATCH HE 
LOOKED CERTAINLY MORE RELAXED THEN 
YOU WOULD EXPECT A PLAYER TO LOOK 
MORE RELAXED THAN YOU WOULD 
EXPECT PLAYER TO LOOK LOOKS VERY 
RELAXED JOE HAD THE PLEASURE OF 
DOING THE LAST NINETEEN FRAMES OF THE 
MATCH AGAINST MAGUIRE WATCH JOE 
PERRY IS BLESSED WITH IS VERY 
GOOD MATCH PLAYER L. TEND TO THINK 
THAT THE BREAK BUILDING AS HE DID 
EARLIER ON THERE YOU CAN SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO INTO THEM 
QUICKER IF IT IS AN OPEN GAME YOU 
FANCY ALI CARTER BUT IF IT IS A 
TIGHT GAME I FANCY JOE PERRY IT 
IS HARD TO CALL 
THIS IS A MATCH 
AND A LOT HAS BEEN FORGOTTEN WITH 
ALL THE TALK OF POTTING AND BREAK 
BUILDING THAT YOU NEED A GOOD ALL 
ROUND GAME 
THAT IS WHAT MAKES A GOOD MATCH 
PLAYER MAYBE HE ERRS ON THE SIDE 
OF CAUTION THAT HAS GONE AWKWARD 
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE BLUE 
NICELY BUT HE NOW WILL HAVE TO 
PLAY THE YELLOW 
RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THE POCKET 
BOTH THESE PLAYERS ARE GOING TO 
BRING GOOD MEMORIES INTO THIS MATCH 
JOE PERRY OF COURSE HAS REALLY 
KEPT HIMSELF TOGETHER AGAINST 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE AND OF COURSE ALI 
CARTER WHAT A DREAM IT IS FOR ANY 
PLAYER TO MAKE A MAXIMUM AT THE 
CRUCIBLE SO THEY HAVE DONE 
THEMSELVES PROUD 
JUST SLIGHTLY 
LOST POSITION HERE L. DON'T KNOW 
WHETHER HE CAN PLAY THE GAP THROUGH 
THE REDS OR PLAY A CANNON TO HOLD 
THE CUE BALL 
ALL HE WAS DOING THERE WAS SLOWING 
THE CUE BALL DOWN HE HAS PLAYED IT 
WELL HE IS UNLUCKY NOT TO BE AN 
ANYTHING EASIER THAN THIS 
NEEDS A GOOD POSITIONAL SHOT NOW TO 
GIVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY TO WIN THE 
FRAME AT THIS VISIT 
THIS WAS HIS 
PROBLEM YESTERDAY HE WENT ON TO 
WIN THE MATCH BUT HE LOST SEVEN 
GAMES FROM OVER FORTY IN FRONT 
AGAINST MAGUIRE 
JOE KEPT GETTING FORTY IN FRONT AND 
JUST COULDN'T CLOSE THE FRAME OUT 
EARLY ENOUGH IS THIS GOING TO BE 
ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE 
HE HAS NOT 
PLAYED THE BEST POSITIONAL SHOT HE 
PLAYED THE BROWN AS A STRAIGHT 
FORWARD TO SIDE CUSHION HE JUST 
UNDERHIT IT 
RECOVERED THE SITUATION WELL THAT 
WAS A GOOD POT GOOD CONTROL OF THE 
CUE BALL 
WHEN PLAYERS GET TO THE SEMI FINAL 
OF THE CRUCIBLE YOU WOULD EXPECT A 
SHAKY START THIS AFTERNOON HENDRY 
MADE ONE HUNDRED FORTY AT HIS FIRST VISIT THIS 
IS JOE PERRY'S FIRST EVER VISIT TO 
THE CRUCIBLE AT THE SEMI FINALS 
HE KEEPS MISSING A VITAL BALLS 
THE VITAL BALL 
HE DIDN'T THINK YOU 
WERE GOING TO BE RIGHT BUT IF HE 
POTS THAT RED HE IS PERFECT ON THE 
BLUE AND NO PROBLEMS A LET OFF 
FOR RONNIE CARTER ALI CARTER 
THIS WOULD HURT JOE EVEN AT THIS 
STAGE IF ALI CARTER WINS THE FRAME 
FROM HERE 
I DIDN'T EXPECT ALI 
CARTER TO MISS THAT 
WE KNOW THAT JOE IS FIFTY THREE IN FRONT 
AND RED COLOUR RED IS ENOUGH BUT 
THESE ARE NOT THE KIND OF REDS HE 
WOULD LIKE TO PLAY EVERY DAY OF THE 
WEEK 
IF THAT WAS THE FIRST SHOT IN A 
BREAK HE WOULD HAVE GOT THAT NINE 
OUT OF TEN 
HE HAS PLAYED IT TO STUN 
IT IN HE WAS THINKING HE WOULD 
COVER IT WITH THE BLACK EVERY 
DIDN'T GO IN IT WAS JUST THAT 
SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE THOUGHT BUT HE 
HAS NOT LEFT ANYTHING EASY 
THE FACT THAT HE IS GETTING OUT THE 
EXTENDED REST SURELY HE'S NOT 
GOING TO PLAY THE CUT ON THIS RED 
THAT WAS A DANGEROUS SHOT TO PLAY 
FOR ME HAS THE YELLOW COME TO HIS 
RESCUE THAT ONE WAS UNMISSABLE 
BEST SHOT OF THE FRAME SO FAR THAT 
IS A FRAME WINNER WITH THE RED 
BEING OVER THE CORNER THAT IS A 
PRESSURE POT 
JOE PERRY LOOKS CERTAIN TO WIN THE 
OPENING FRAME 
HE STARTED OFF WITH A TREMENDOUS 
RED ALI CARTER 
BUT HE'S NOT GOING 
TO GET ANYTHING OUT OF THIS FRAME 
IN THIS SITUATION JOE PERRY WILL 
BE AWARE THE CAN CLEAR THE TABLE 
HERE HE KEEPS ALI CARTER OF THE 
TABLE 
OFF THE TABLE AS A PLAYER 
YOU'RE THINKING NOW IF YOU CAN 
CLEAR THESE YOU HAVE KEPT YOUR 
OPPONENT OFF THE TABLE 
GOOD POINT 
THAT IT IS THE FIRST TIME THAT ALI 
CARTER HAS PLAYED AT THE SINGLE 
TABLE IT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT OUT 
THERE IT IS ABOUT THREE TIMES 
BIGGER THAN IT WHEN YOU FIRST 
PLAYED 
AND JOE WOULD BE ALL TOO AWARE THAT 
HE WANTS TO GIVE ALI CARTER NO 
TABLE TIME AT ALL 
THE FIRST THING YOU NOTICE IS WHEN 
YOU'RE IN A TWO TABLE SITUATION 
YOU WERE RIGHT BUT DOUBLE THE TABLE 
YOU ARE RIGHT ON TOP OF THE TABLE 
A BIT FURTHER AWAY YOU HAVE DIFFERENT VIEW 
YOU DO NOT REALLY SEE WHAT BALLS 
WILL GO IF THERE ARE ANY PLANTS ON 
WHEN YOU'RE ARE SAT CLOSER YOU 
FEEL MORE INVOLVED TO STOP IT TAKES 
A BIT OF GETTING USED TO THE BEST 
WAY TO GET USED TO IT IS WHEN 
YOU'RE AT THE TABLE POTTING BALLS 
AND JOE PERRY IS DOING PLENTY OF 
THAT 
NOT BOTHERED ABOUT THE BLACK 
STARTED WITH A FIFTY FOUR FINISHED WITH A 
SIXTY TWO HE WILL BE PLEASED WITH THAT 
JOE PERRY LEADS 
GOOD EVENING IT WAS FASCINATING 
LISTING T. YOU TALK BEFORE ABOUT THE 
DIFFERENT SET UP DOES IT MAKE A 
BIG DIFFERENCE TO THE PLAYERS 
ABSOLUTELY BUT JOE HAS SETTLED 
IMMEDIATELY ALI CARTER LOOKS BIT 
EDGY STILL BUT WHAT A START FOR 
JOE PERRY HE WON HIS MATCH IN THE 
DECIDING FRAME QUITE HOT PURSUIT TO 
RELAX 
IT IS FANTASTIC TO JUST GET RELAX OVER THE LINE 
YOU HAVE LONGER TO 
WALK TO THE TABLE BUT ARE YOU 
TELLING ME IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE 
IT IS A MASSIVE CHANGE TO THE VENUE 
YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE NEXT TO 
COMPLETE FOR THE FIRST THREE 
MATCHES WITH SOME INTERACTION BUT 
YOU CANNOT GO BACK AND UTTER UNDER 
YOUR BREATH NOW YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN 
YOUR OPPONENT HIS WAY ACROSS THE 
VENUE 
IT IS THE WORLD VENUE CHAMPIONSHIPS BUT THE FORM BUT 
DOES NOT GIVE IT QUITE RIGHT ALWAYS 
THIS IS THE FOURTH YEAR ARE SOMEBODY 
OUT OF THE TOP SIXTEEN HAS REACHED THE 
SEMI FINALS WE HAD SHAUN MURPHY 
MARK SELBY MARCO FU AND NOW JOE 
PERRY JUST SHOWS THE STRENGTH IN 
DEPTH WE HAVE 
IT SHOWS WHEN YOU 
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY YOU HAVE 
OWNED IT TAKE IT EARNED IT 
I AGREE THAT ALI 
CARTER LOOKED A BIT SHAKY BUT JOE 
PERRY APPEARS TO HAVE SETTLED 
IMMEDIATELY 
PRETTY GOOD BREAK OFF SHOT FOUND 
THE BAULK CUSHION THE GREEN IS 
COVERING ANY PATH BACK TO BAULK 
THERE IS A RED DOWN THE RIGHT HAND 
SIDE I SUPPOSE HE COULD PLAY THE 
POT IF IT DOESN'T GO IN BRING THE 
CUE BALL TO THE TOP CUSHION 
REASONABLY SAFE 
HE NEARLY GOT THE DOUBLE KISS JOHN JOHN AND I ARE BOTH BIG FANS OF FOOTBALL 
AND WE HAVE GOT THREE GREAT 
FOOTBALLERS INTO LIGHT ENSURE 
SOMETIME DURING THE EVENING WE WILL 
SHOW YOU THEM MARK CROSSLEY WHO 
HAS BEEN A GREAT GOALKEEPER FOR 
NOTTINGHAM FOREST AND MATT LE 
TISSIER ONE OF THE GREATEST 
PENALTY TAKERS OF ALL TIME MARK 
CROSSLEY WAS THE ONLY WHEN YOU EVER 
SAVED ONE OF HIS PENALTIES 
WE HAVE HAD OTHER CELEBS HERE OVER 
THE YEARS IT IS A GREAT PLACE TO 
COME AND WATCH SNOOKER HE WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED HE OVER SCREWED THE 
CUE BALL SO THE BLUE IS NOT ON 
THE TWO GUYS YOU JUST MENTIONED 
THE PROBLEM IS SOMETIMES YOU 
INVITE THEM DOWN YOU GET SO CLOSE 
TO THE PLAYERS YOU'RE FRIGHTENED 
TO BREED WAS TALKING TO THE 
EUROPEAN TOUR GOLFER DAVID LEAN 
AND HE SAID EXACTLY THE SAME 
ALI CARTER MAY TAKE THIS ONE ON HE 
CAN PLAY THE RED DEXTER THE OTHER 
AS A SHOT TO NOTHING SPIRIT ROUND 
THREE CUSHIONS SPINACH ROUND 
THREE CUSHIONS 
THAT SURPRISED ME THAT SHOT HE HE HAS GOT THE SNOOKER JUST BASICALLY 
COMING OFF THE RIGHT HAND SIDE 
CUSHION WHICH LOOKS THE OBVIOUS 
WAY YOU WOULD LEAVE SOMETHING SO 
HE IS NOW COMING OFF THE BOTTOM 
CUSHION SIDE CUSHION AND INTO THE 
CLUSTER 
THAT IS THE REASON THAT I THOUGHT 
ALI CARTER SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE 
RISK ON THE SHOT TO NOTHING 
THESE TWO PLAYERS PLAYING FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN THE SEMI FINALS OF A 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP AND IN FRONT OF 
THEM THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT THE 
TROPHY THAT WILL BE OUT THERE FOR 
BOTH THE THEM TO LOOK AT ONE LAST 
YEAR BY JOHN HIGGINS AND IT IS 
THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE ALL DREAMED 
ABOUT NOT MANY HAVE HAD THEIR HAND 
AT IT THE TWO PLAYERS IN THE OTHER 
SEMI FINAL HAVE HAD IT ON SEVERAL 
OCCASIONS WELL ONE OF THESE TWO 
PLAYERS AT THE TABLE GET THEIR NAME 
ON THE TROPHY 
IF YOU LOT IN IT 
YOU CAN WIN IT IF YOU ALREADY IT 
IF YOU ARE IN IT 
PLAYED BACK TO THAT TOP CUSHION 
THE ONLY THING WITH THIS SHOT YOU 
HAVE TO GET IT TIGHT THE CUE BALL 
IF YOU LEAVE YOUR OPPONENTS SO HE 
CAN GET THE CUE BALL DOWN BELOW THE 
CENTRE HE HAS AN EASY TASK OF 
GETTING THE CUE BALL BACK 
HE WOULD LIKE TO NESTLE UP BEHIND 
THE BLUE 
THIS IS NOT EASY TO GET SAFE NOW 
HE WILL HAVE TO GET HEIGHT UP WITH 
HIS CUE TO SCREW BACK TO THE 
CUSHION THAT IS A VERY VERY GOOD 
SHOT 
YES THAT IS 
AS GOOD A SHOT SHOT AS YOU COULD HAVE PLAYED IN THAT 
SITUATION A TAP ON THE TABLE FROM 
JOE PERRY HE REALISED HER 
DIFFICULT THAT WAS HOW DIFFICULT 
YOU CAN SEE THE WAY THESE REDS ARE 
SPREADING IT ALL OVER THE TABLE 
THAT THE NEXT CHANCE COULD BE A 
COSTLY ONE HE IS STRIKING DOWN AT 
THE WHITE IS AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO 
BOUNCE CIRCUIT JUDGE IT THAT WELL 
AFTER HITTING THE RED TO SCREW 
BACK TO THE CUSHION EXCELLENT SHOT 
I USED TO HATE THESE FRAMES YOU 
WOULD KEEP PLAYING SAFE AND THEN 
ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU WOULD FORCE 
YOUR OPPONENT TO PLAY A POT INTO 
THE MIDDLE POCKET L. THINK IT WILL 
BE JOE PERRY WITH THE FIRST CHANCE 
HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH 
TO IT DIRECT BUT HE SHOULD BE ABLE 
TO GIVE PLAY ONE ON TO THE OTHER 
IF HE DOES HE WILL HAVE TO READ TO 
HIT HIT THE RED ON THE POCKET 
HALF BALL HE COULD PROBABLY SWERVE 
AND HIT IT 
HE DIDN'T MAKE THE BEST JOB OF IT 
THAT CUE BALL SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN 
AS CLOSE TO THE CUSHION AS THIS 
BROWN LOOKS THE OBVIOUS BALL TO 
PLAY BUT IT IS TRICKY AS HIS 
YELLOW AS IT IS YELLOW 
VERY VERY GOOD POT THOSE ARE 
HORRIBLE 
THE THREE REDS ALONG THE BACK 
DOESN'T WANT TO MAKE A CONTACT ON 
THE MIDDLE HE WANTS TO JUST ROLL 
ALONG THE CUSHION WITHOUT TOUCHING 
THE REDS 
IT WAS ALWAYS TAKING A CHANCE AND 
WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN 
GOLDEN 
DIDN'T GO RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF 
THE POCKET IT STRUGGLED IN 
IT IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO WIN 
THIS ON YELLOWS AND BROWNS HE 
NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT PLAYING FOR 
THE BLACK THAT WILL SOON START 
RATTLING THE WE HAVE HAD THE MAXIMUMS 
THE EASIER WAY TO GET ON TO THE TOP 
GRADES IS BEFORE HE STARTS TO COME 
UP AND DO BUSINESS HE WOULD LOVE 
TO GET 
ONTO THE 
BLACK ROW DING HE 
COULD START THINKING ABOUT WINNING 
THE FRAME AT ONE VISIT DO KNOW WHETHER 
POTS INTO 
THE 
LEFT HAND CORNER 
IT DOES NOT 
APPEAR TO FROM HERE HE HAS GOT TO 
BE CAREFUL THE NEXT FOUR REDS AND 
PINKS OR BLACKS SHOULD BE 
STRAIGHTFORWARD 
WHEN SHE GETS RID OF THE REDS 
EITHER SIDE OF THE PINK IT WILL BE 
AVAILABLE 
I SAID WHOEVER MADE THE FIRST 
MISTAKE IT COULD BE COSTLY AND IT 
IS CERTAINLY LOOKING THAT WAY IT 
IS JUST THE START THAT JOE PERRY 
WAS LOOKING FOR 
I THINK THE RED WILL GO HE CAN 
PICK THE CUE BALL ON THE SAME SIDE 
AS HE IS HER HE HAS DONE IT AGAIN 
IT IS FRIGHTENING 
HE JUST JABBED AT THAT SO WHAT 
IT'S A LOT HANGS HIS HEAD IN SHAME 
NO WAY HE SHOULD BE MISSING THAT 
ALI CARTER HAS A CHANCE AT THAT RED 
TO THE LEFT HAND CORNER IF HE 
TAKES IT ON HE HAS GOT TO GET IT 
IF HE DOES NOT GET THIS HE LOSES 
THE FRAME FOR ME 
BUT HE DID GET IT BLADE SHORT 
WELL PLAYED BREED SHORT BRAVE 
SHOT 
ALI CARTER COULD HAVE CLINCHED IT 
IN THE 
FIRST FRAME BUT HE MUST HAVE THAT HE GOT THIS IS A 
HALF CHANCE WITH THE GREEN AND BLUE 
OR THIS SIDE CUSHION 
IN THE FIRST FRAME JOE PERRY 
MISSED WHAT WAS CLEARLY FRAME BALL 
YOU FORGET ABOUT THE MISTAKE BUT 
YOU DO NOT FORGET ABOUT IT IF IT 
ALMOST COSTS YOU THE FRAME AND THAT 
IS 
WHAT ALI 
CARTER WILL BE TRYING 
TO DO NOW PUNISH HIM FOR THAT 
MISTAKE IT WAS AN EASY RED THAT HE 
MISSED 
THAT WAS A CLEVER SHOT USING THE 
RED TO PUSH THE CUE GOLDEN AND 
SLIDE IT TOWARDS THE CORNER HE 
WOULD LIKE TO GET RID OF THE RED 
BELOW THE PINK BECAUSE THE PINK IS 
EASIER TO MOVE INTO PLAY IDEALLY 
HE WOULD LIKE TO TRY TO GET ON TO 
THAT RED NEXT TO THE PINK IF HE CAN 
IT GIVES A LOT MORE ROOM TO GET 
THAT CANNON FROM PINK OR BLACK 
HE'S HAVING A LOOK TRYING TO WORK 
OUT HOW HE NEEDS TO COME UP 
WOULD RATHER PLAY THE CANNON OF THE 
PINK 
HE HAS GOT TO BE ON IT PERFECT HAS 
HE WON TOO FAR CAN HE GET TO THE 
POTTING ANGLE ON THE RED THE 
EFFORT HE WILL BE HAVING A CLOSE 
LOOK AT THIS IF HE TERRIFIC HE 
THE REFEREE 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE CAN CREATE 
AN ANGLE FULL WHERE THE BLUE HAS 
HE IS KEEPING PAST THE IF IT HE IS 
KEEPING A BEADY EYE ON THE 
SITUATION THE HE THE EFFORT HE 
THE REFEREE 
THE DOUBLE IS NOT ON 
NOW HE WILL BE TRYING TO GET THE 
CUE BALL BEHIND THE BLACK 
AND THE 
RED SAFE 
ON THE BAULK CUSHION 
HE HAS NOT MADE A GOOD JOB OF THAT 
BUT HE HAS HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A 
RESULT HE HAS LEFT THE RED NEAR 
THE CORNER STRAIGHT HE ALMOST 
HANDED THE FRAME TO JOE PERRY L. DO 
NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS THINKING ABOUT 
THERE 
FOR IF THAT RED WAS RIGHT OVER THE 
POCKET YOU COULD PLAY CUSHION FIRST 
BUT JOE PERRY IS NOT EVEN 
CONSIDERING IT 
HE WILL JUST TRY TO 
CONTAIN THE WHITE NEAR THE BAULK 
LINE 
THAT CUE BALL NEEDS TO STOP HE CAN 
POT THE BROWN WHETHER HE CAN GET 
POSITION ON THE LAST RED IT IS 
TOUGH BECAUSE HE IS VERY CLOSE TO 
THE BRINK OR WILL HE JUST MAKE 
CERTAIN OF THE BROWN AND BENTLEY 
SAFE AND THEN PLAY SAFE 
HE DECIDED TO PLAY THE DEEP SCREW 
AND PLAYED IT WELL BUT THIS RED IS 
TRICKY THE FULL BALL AWAY FROM IT 
YOU ARE THE MORE DIFFICULT IT IS 
THE FATHER FURTHER 
HE COULD PLAY FOR THE GREEN OFF 
THIS RED BECAUSE THE GREEN WILL BE 
TOUGH TO GET ONTO 
HE NEEDS OF THAT OF THE TOP AND HE 
HAS GOT A BIT OF HELP HE NEEDS 
AT BIT OF HELP 
AS YOU SUGGESTED TO GET POSITION 
ON THE COLOUR HE HAD TO PLAY IT 
WITH AN EXTRA BIT OF PACE AND THAT 
MADE IT EMINENTLY MISSABLE 
AT FIRST GLANCE THIS SAFETY SHOT 
IS NOT ABSOLUTELY STRAIGHT FORWARD 
IF THAT RED HAD KISSED THE GREEN 
FULL BALL HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN 
TROUBLE HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH IT 
SLIGHTLY BUT HE WAS NINETEEN POINTS IN 
FRONT HE WOULD NOT HAVE WANTED TO 
BRING THE GREEN INTO PLAY 
IF IT HAD CAUGHT THE BROWN FULL 
THIS RED WOULD HAVE BEEN POTTABLE 
THE FRAME COULD HINGE ON THIS RED 
THIS LOOKS GOOD GOOD LINE WITH 
THE GREEN AND PINK AND THE FLICK 
OFF THE BLACK HAS HELPED THIS IS A 
TOUGH SNOOKER THIS IS TOUGH 
NORMALLY YOU WOULD THINK ABOUT 
COMING OFF THE TOP CUSHION BUT YOU 
CANNOT DO THAT HERE HE IS PLAYING 
THIS WOULD THE SWERVE WHERE IS THE 
RED GOING THOUGH TOE 
NO NOW JOE PERRY CANNOT POT THIS 
HE IS PLAYING IN OFF THE CUSHION 
HE HAS TO BE CAREFUL WITH THE WHITE 
THAT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE CLOSE 
JOE PERRY IS BIG FAVOURITE HERE 
BECAUSE OF THE BLUE AND THE BLACK 
BEING THE CUSHION HE WOULD LIKE TO 
FLICK OFF THE 
BLACK AND 
BRING 
BLUE 
INTO PLAY 
BUT HE 
WILL BE 
HAPPY 
WITH ONE OF THEM THAT WAS AN 
EXCELLENT SWEAR OF SHORT HOW HE 
MISSED THE PINK I WILL NOT KNOW 
SWERVE SHOT 
HE HAS GOT THE MOST IMPORTANT BALL 
SAFE THE RED THERE MAY BE AN 
EDGE STICKING OUT BUT ONLY AN EDGE 
QUARTER OF PAINT A QUOTE OR PINK 
COAT OF PAINT THAT WAS GOOD 
HIT NOTHING WRONG WITH HIS 
EYESIGHT 
THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT EYESIGHT SAFETY SHOT WITH THE BLUE AND 
BLACK BEING SAFE JOE PERRY IS 
FAVOURITE FOR THIS FRAME THAT WAS GOOD I LIKE THAT SHOT 
THIS AS LIKELY AS NOT WILL BE A 
SNOOKER ANOTHER SWERVE THIS TIME 
BETWEEN THE GREEN AND THE PINK 
JUST MISSED IT ON THE WAY UP BUT 
CAUGHT IT ON THE WAY BACK 
HE CAME VERY CLOSE TO THE BLACK 
WING PLAYING THIS WERE WHEN 
PLAYING THE SWERVE 
THAT WAS A POOR SHOT IF HE HAS NOT 
LEFT THIS RED HE HAS BEEN 
FORTUNATE A POOR SAFETY SHOT FROM 
ALI CARTER 
IN ANY SORT OF COLOUR YELLOW OR 
GREEN WOULD BE ENOUGH SO HE DOES 
NOT HAVE TO DO TOO MUCH WITH THE 
CUE BALL HERE 
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED THE PINK TO THE 
MIDDLE 
BUT THE 
BLACK IS A SECOND 
MIDDLE BUT THE BLACK IS A SECOND CHOICE 
HE COULD NOT HAVE FINISHED CHOICE MUCH BETTER ON THAT BLACK ALI CARTER HAS CONCEDED 
JOE PERRY IS SCORING WILL AND LEADS 
BY EIGHTY TWO TO ZERO L. L. SAID SCORING WELL 
NORMALLY YOU ARE HAPPY WITH FORTY 
ABOVE OR IN EVERY FRAME BUT IF 
YOU GET FORTY IT WAS IT CAN PUT YOU 
IN TROUBLE 
PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU 
ARE IN AMONGST THE BALLS THAT CAN 
BE COSTLY THIS WAS THE FIRST FRAME 
HE JUST NEEDED ONE MORE RED WHICH 
WOULD HAVE CLINCHED IT AND THEN IN 
THE LAST FRAME WITH THIS RED AN 
EASY POT MISSED THAT THE ONLY 
THING THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE HE 
HASN'T BEEN PUNISHED 
AT THE END OF 
THE DAY STEPHEN MAGUIRE WON SIX 
FRAMES AND A SIMILAR SITUATION YOU 
CANNOT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT 
JOE PERRY HAS GOT TO GET A LITTLE 
BIT LESS TENSE WHEN HE APPROACHES 
THE WINNING POST 
YES IT WILL 
CATCH UP WITH YOU EVENTUALLY ALI 
CARTER HAS NOT REALLY GOT IN FIRST 
THE BLACK JUST STAYED OUT HE NEEDS 
A GOOD VISIT TO SETTLE HIM DOWN AND 
GET HIS NOSE IN FRONT EARLY ON IN 
THE FRAME 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP YOUR 
OPPONENT OFF THE TABLE ALI CARTER 
HAS ONLY THIRTY POINTS SO FAR 
THIS RED 
THIS RED IS POTTABLE 
JUST PULLED UP ENOUGH HE HAS THE 
ANGLE ON THE BROWN TO PLAY FOR 
LOOSE REDS 
THE PINK IS COVERING THE INTENDED 
RED QUITE A MARGIN OF ERROR THERE 
SOME ONE OF JOE'S CLASS SHOULDN'T 
MISJUDGE THE SHOT BY THAT FAR 
FINISHED UP WITH A TOUGH ONE THIS 
IS WHAT HAWKEYE WOULD HAVE PLAYED 
AND THIS IS WHAT JOE PERRY PLAYED 
THAT IS WHAT HE WAS HOPING FOR 
HOPE HAWKEYE NEVER ENTERS THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP THEY'LL ALL BE IN 
TROUBLE 
HE HAS TROUBLE A RESULT AND TROUBLE ENDED UP WITH A GREAT SAFETY HE HE DID HAVE A RESULT AS YOU SAY 
LUCKY LAD 
ALI WAS BEMUSED AT 
LUCKY LAD MISSING THE RED DIDN'T REALISE 
WHAT THE KISS HAD DONE AND HAD TO 
APOLOGISE APOLOGISE HE PLAYED A POOR SAFETY APOLOGISE IN THE LAST FRAME WHICH COST HIM 
HE'S HIT THIS RED SO THIN WAS 
TRYING TO GET ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE 
OF THE BLACK HE IS NOT SETTLED YET 
TAKING THE SAME PATTERN OF THE 
HENDRY OSULLIVAN MATCH THE 
FAVOURITE THREE TO ZERO BEHIND 
HE CAN PLAY ROUND THE BACK OF THE 
LOOSE RED OR HE CAN TRY FINISH 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LOOSE REDS HE 
MUST TRY NOT TO BE SNOOKERED BY THE 
BLACK 
NOT THE BEST ANGLE DON'T MIND 
SCREWING INTO THESE TO GET ONTO 
THE REDS BY THE CUSHION HIT THEM 
WELL ALWAYS SAY NEVER SCREW INTO THE PACK BUT WITH THE 
REDS ON 
THE CUSHION YOU DON'T MIND VERY VERY COOLLY PLAYED NEVER ANY DOUBT 
NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE 
HE LOOKS GREAT UP TO FIFTY AND IS THEN 
SHAKY THIS IS AN EXCELLENT 
OPPORTUNITY BETTER CHANCE FOR A 
FRAME WINNING CONTRIBUTION BEING 
FORTY POINTS IN THE LEAD 
STRAIGHT ENOUGH ON THE RED TO LEFT 
MIDDLE HE CAN RUN THROUGH FOR THE 
BLUE 
NOT THE BEST ANGLE IS ONE OF THOSE 
YOU EITHER RUN BRUCE GREEN CHEESE 
OR 
INCHES THE RUN 
THROUGH THREE INCHES OR BACK THREE 
INCHES 
THIS IS THE POINT IN FRAMES WHERE 
JOE PERRY CAN WIN THE FRAME 
ALI CARTER HAS HARDLY HAD HIS HAND 
AND THE TABLE AT ALL YET HAD HIS 
HAND ON THE TABLE 
ONE MORE RED TO SECURE A FRAME 
VIRTUALLY AT HIS FIRST SCORING 
VISIT 
THAT IS WHAT HE HAS TO DO TO MAKE 
SURE OF WINNING A WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
POT THE RED GO SEVENTY CHAMPIONSHIP AHEAD 
ONLY CITY SEVEN REMAINING SIXTY SEVEN 
THE RED WAS THE IMPORTANT THING 
THAT JUST MEANS IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT 
ALI CARTER WILL COME BACK TO THE 
TABLE HE PLAYED A VERY POOR SAFETY 
SHOT THAT LEFT JOE PERRY THIS 
CHANCE 
ALI CARTER CONCEDES JOE PERRY IS 
CERTAINLY THE QUICKER OUT OF THE 
BLOCKS 
EARLY DAYS BUT SURELY A LEVEL OF 
CONCERN FOR ALI CARTER HE WILL NOT 
BE SETTLED UNTIL HE GETS A FRAME ON 
THE BOARD 
I THINK THAT IS WHY HE 
HAS GONE OUT OF THE ARENA TO TRY 
AND CONSENT COMPOSE HIMSELF JOE 
PERRY IS DOING WHAT HE DID AGAINST 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE HE WON THE FIRST 
FOUR FRAMES AND ONCE AGAIN HE HAS 
GOT OFF TO A GOOD START YOU WOULD 
THINK HE HAS BEEN AT THIS STAGE IN 
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS NUMEROUS 
TIMES THE WAY HE IS RELAXED WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR OBSERVATIONS 
AT THE 
MOMENT IT IS ALL JOE PERRY HE IS 
MAKING A FORTY ODD A FIFTY ODD HE MUST 
HAVE MADE MORE THAN ANYBODY IN THIS 
TIME IT HE WAS MISSING AGAINST 
MAGUIRE WHO WAS CLEANING UP THAT 
HASN'T HAPPENED SO FAR BECAUSE ALI 
CARTER HAS NOT SETTLED DOWN BUT 
THAT WAS MORE LIKE IT 
A VERY THIN 
LINE THAT DECIDES HOW YOU PERFORM 
IN A WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
JUST TO 
GET TO THE STAGE YOU WHAT HAD YOU 
COULD ALI CARTER IN THE FIRST ROUND 
BARRY HAWKINS GOT TAKEN OFF THE 
TABLE AT NINE TO NINE IT WAS DEFINITELY TO 
ALI CARTER'S ADVANTAGE BUT DID NOT 
LOOK LIKE HE WAS GOING TO WIN A 
FRAME DARE I MENTION IT BUT JOE 
PERRY WAS EIGHT TO FOUR DOWN TO ME IN 
QUALIFYING BUT PLAYED 
FANTASTICALLY TO KNOCK ME OUT AND 
HERE HE IS IN A SEMI FINAL IT IT COULD DRAMATICALLY CHANGE AROUND 
THE RECESSION INTERVAL ALWAYS SEEMS 
TO CHANGE THE MATCH THE MID 
SESSION INTERVAL 
YOU WOULDN'T SAY THIS 
WAS A MAST WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING 
OVER THIRTY THREE FRAMES BUT HE NEEDS TO GET 
OFF THE MARK QUITE QUICKLY IF YOU 
KEEP BUILDING YOUR OPPONENT'S 
CONFERENCE BY MISSING BALLS 
PLAYING A POOR SAFETY IT BECOMES A 
MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB YOUR OPPONENT'S 
CONFIDENCE YOU HAVE TO STOP THE 
ROT SOMEHOW ALI CARTER AS YET 
HAS NOT HAD HIS HAND ON THE TABLE JOE PERRY HAS DOMINATED PLAY 
I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH THAT 
SHOT O. K. HE IS THINKING HE WILL 
BRING THE BLACK INTO PLAY BUT WHAT 
HAS HE DONE HE HAS PUT NO PRESSURE 
ON HIS OPPONENT HE HAS GOT AN EASY 
FLICK OFF THE RED BACK UP THE 
TABLE ALI CARTER IS THINKING IF HE 
HAS THE BLACK AVAILABLE IF HE HAS 
A CHANCE BUT HE HAS NOT DONE 
ANYTHING TO PUT HIS OPPONENT UNDER 
PRESSURE 
YOU GET CHANCES NORMALLY PRESSURE BY PLAYING GREAT SAFETY JOE PERRY 
HAS NOW PLAYED THE FIRST SAFETY 
SHOT ALI CARTER IS GOING TO HAVE 
TO REPLY IF HE DOESN'T HE HAS 
FREED THE BLACK 
HE IS NOT PANICKING BUT HE THINK 
JUST WANTS THINGS TO HAPPEN 
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT 
DEPENDS ON WHAT ANGLE HE HAS ON 
THIS RED 
HE IS PLAYING FOR BLUE OR PAUL 
PROVE ALL BAULK COLOUR THAT IS ALL 
YOU NEED WHEN YOU ARE THREE TO ZERO BEHIND 
ALI CARTER DIDN'T PLAY THE BEST OF 
SAFETY SHOTS BUT THIS IS CRAWL WE 
HAVE SEEN IT HAPPEN SO MANY TIMES 
AND THE BLACK IS AVAILABLE INTO 
BOTH POCKET THANKS TO MR. CARTER 
THIS COULD BE A FRAME WINNING A 
FLUKE 
WELL THAT IS A POOR SHOT AND THE 
REASON WHY HE HAD NO REASON TO 
PLAY THE CANNON HE COULD HAVE 
PLAYED A LITTLE STUN RUN THROUGH 
UNLESS YOU COULD GUARANTEE MAKING 
FULL BALL CONTACT WITH THE SECOND 
RED YOU DO NOT PLAY THE CANNON HE MISSED A CHANCE THERE 
DEAR ME WHAT ARE THEY SAYING IT 
NEVER RAINS BUT IT POURS 
HE IS A LOVELY GUY ALI CARTER IN 
SOME WAYS YOU CAN BRING IT ON 
YOURSELF HE HAS JUST NOT PLAYED 
GOOD SAFETY BUT THIS ONCE AGAIN 
WAS A GREAT BETTER FORTUNE BIT 
OF FORTUNE 
HE NEEDS TO REST INTO THEM TIGHT A 
COUPLE OF THE MAR POTTABLE L. THINK 
HE HAS LEFT ONE IN THE MIDDLE A 
COUPLE OF THEM ARE POTTABLE I I SEEMED NOTHING GOES TO RIGHT CORNER 
BUT THE RED ON THE EXTREME LEFT 
WILL CERTAINLY GO TO THE LEFT 
CORNER POCKET IT MAY GO TO THE 
LEFT MIDDLE 
VERY FIRST FRAME WHEN HE WAS FIFTY FOUR 
POINTS IN FRONT VIRTUALLY THE SAME 
RED TO THE TOP JAW SOMETIMES YOU 
COULD HIT THEM THICKER ON ONE SIDE 
THIN ON THE OTHERS HE HAS JUST NOT 
SUSSED THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE 
TABLE YET 
IT IS THE WORST THING YOU IN THE 
WORLD UNTIL YOU SETTLE THE 
WORST VENUE 
ANY VENUE IS BAD WHEN 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT A FRAME ON THE 
BOARD JUST HAVING A GOOD LOOK AT 
THE PACK HERE L. DON'T KNOW IF 
THERE IS A PLANT CAN'T SEE ONE 
CAN'T SEE ANYTHING THAT WOULD TEMPT 
ME 
THIS IS A GOOD SAFETY JOE 
DEFINITELY HAS GOT THE BETTER 
WEIGHT OF CUE BALL AT THE MOMENT 
WE KEEP GOING BACK TO SAINT ABOUT 
TABLE TIME IT LOOKS AS IF IT IS A 
FIFTY TO FIFTY BUT EVERY TIME ALI CARTER 
COMES TO IT HE HAS TO DIG HIMSELF 
OUT OF SITUATIONS 
THERE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHEN 
THINGS ARE NOT GOING RIGHT THE 
BAULK COLOURS SEEMED TO BE TWICE IS 
BECAUSE YOUR OPPONENT'S 
THIS IS THE SHOT HE PLAYED BEFORE 
YOU DON'T PLAY THE CANNON IF YOU 
YOU JUST PLAY A LITTLE STUN A DRAG 
SHOT HE WOULD HAVE GOT ANYWHERE 
NEAR THAT RED IT WAS A MISTAKE HE 
WENT FOR THAT RED L. ASSUME HE 
THOUGHT THE ONLY RED HE COULD LEAVE 
WAS THE ONE HE PLAYED 
I CANNOT SEE ANYTHING EASY TO GET 
ALI CARTER STARTED HERE POSSIBLY 
THE RED JUST BELOW THE PINK BUT 
THAT IS A DANGEROUS SHOT TO TAKE ON 
I DON'T THINK THERE IS AN EASY 
SAFETY SHOT EITHER 
WELL THAT IS A MARVELLOUS SHOT 
USING THE REST A PLANE WITH THAT 
MUCH RIGHT HAND SIDE THAT IS TOP 
DRAWER PLAYING WITH THAT MUCH 
RIGHT HAND SIDE 
YELLOW AND GREEN AVAILABLE I THINK 
WE MENTIONED THAT THE RED JUST 
BELOW THE PINK WILL POT THAT IS 
NOT THE BEST WHITE HE HAS EVER 
PLAYED NOT SETTLED AT ALL YET 
THERE MAY BE ONE ON BUT THAT IS 
GOING TO BE TOUGH 
THAT WAS A VERY GOOD POT AND 
UNLUCKILY ADDED THINK HE IS ON 
BLACK OR PINK HE IS SHAKING HIS 
HEAD BECAUSE HE THINKS THAT HE 
PLAYED THE POT AND HE MUST HAVE 
THOUGHT HE WAS BOUND TO BE ON PINK 
OR BLACK 
I DON'T BLAME HIM TRYING TO GET 
THIS CUE BALL TIGHT AGAINST THE 
BAULK CUSHION BEHIND THE GREEN 
THE ONLY THING THAT USED TO PUT YOU 
OFF UP PLAYING THAT SHOT YOU 
KNOW YOU'RE GETTING THE YELLOW SAFE 
HE HAS NOT FOUND THE BAULK CUSHION 
AND SO FAR THIS EVENING JOE 
PERRY'S SAFETY HAS BEEN OF THE 
HIGHEST ORDER AND THAT IS ANOTHER 
PRETTY GOOD ONE 
HE HAS LEFT A SHOT ON I DON'T 
THINK THERE IS ENOUGH ROOM TO GET 
IN BETWEEN THE BLACK AND REDS IF 
HE PLAYS THE POT THE LAST TIME HE 
PLAYED A LONG POT HE MISSED IT BY 
QUITE A LONG WAY SO WHY THINK WE 
ARE LOOKING FOR A SAFETY SO I 
THINK 
THAT IS THE FIRST POOR SAFETY HE 
HAS NOT LEFT ANYTHING EASY 
HE HAD TWO BALLS TO AVOID IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE TABLE IT WAS A BIG 
ASK YOU TO DO THAT BUT ALI CARTER 
JUST CANNOT GET COMFORTABLE HERE 
THAT WAS A BIG SHOT AND IT WAS 
TERRIFIC 
THAT RED COULD GIVE HIM ANOTHER RED 
AND THE BLACK WHAT AN EXCELLENT 
SHOT HE PLAYED THE CANNON SUPERBLY 
THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANCE AS HE HAS 
HAD THIS EVENING 
HE JUST OVERRAN AGAIN ON THE 
POSITION THIS IS THE PROBLEM WHEN 
YOU HAVE NOT HAD THE TABLE TIME 
YOU HAVE GOT TO FIND IT ALMOST 
IMMEDIATELY WHEN YOU TAKE THESE 
OPPORTUNITIES YOU CANNOT KEEP 
RUNNING OUT OF POSITION IT MAKES 
THE NEXT SHOT MORE DIFFICULT 
HE COULD HAVE LEFT ITSELF IN ALL 
SORTS OF TROUBLE THERE IF HE HAD 
NESTLED ON THOSE REDS 
HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET GOOD 
POSITION ON THE BLUE THIS TIME 
DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE 
CUE BALL JUST NEEDS CLOSE CONTROL 
USED TO SAY WITH THE GREAT BREAKS 
I COULD HAVE POTTED THAT BUT IT 
IS THE CUE BALL CONTROL THAT 
MATTERS 
HE IS BLESSED WITH A BEAUTIFUL CUE 
ACTION GET THROUGH THE BALL VERY 
WELL HE IS ONE OF THE PLAYERS WHO 
GENERATE PLENTY OF SPIN WHEN NEEDED 
IF IT COMES TO A POWER SHOT YOU 
WOULD FANCY ALI CARTER TO PLAY 
BETTER BUT JOE PERRY IS BETTER AT 
SAFETY L. THINK ALL THOSE THREE 
REDS WILL POT INTO THE OPPOSITE 
POCKET 
PROBABLY THE KEY SHOT TO THE FRAME 
NOW IF HE GETS THE PERFECT ANGLE 
ON THE BLUE HE CAN DROP TO THE 
SIDE CUSHION IF HE CANNOT DROP 
BEHIND THESE REDS GIVE YOURSELF AN 
ANGLE ON THE BLUE SO YOU CAN PLAY 
THE CANNON AND BRING ONESELF INTO 
PLAY BRING THEM INTO PLAY 
THIS IS SO SIMILAR TO THE MATCH 
THIS AFTERNOON O'SULLIVAN HARDLY 
POTTED A BALL IN THE FIRST THREE 
FRAMES WON THE FOURTH FRAME AND 
CARTER IS DOING EXACTLY THE SAME 
THING 
GOING BACK TO THE BLACK THREE OR 
FOUR SHOTS AGO WHEN HE HAD THE 
PERFECT ANGLE HE HAD TO PLAY THE 
BLUE AT PACE THAT IS WHY HE LOST 
POSITION 
WHAT MAKES THIS A LITTLE POSITION BIT EASIER THOUGH IN FRONT HE 
ONLY NEEDS THE RED HE IS FORTY SEVEN 
POINTS IN FRONT 
HE IS PLAYING SAFE HE'S GOING TO 
TRY AND PROTECT THAT LEAD DIDN'T 
THINK IT WAS WORTH TAKING THE RISKY 
RED 
IT WAS ALWAYS A BIG BALL THE 
YELLOW ALI CARTER ONLY NEEDS ONE 
BALL SO HE WILL BE PLAYING THIS AS 
A SHOT TO NOTHING 
WHAT HE WOULDN'T GIVE FOR FRAME ON 
THE BOARD NOW IT IS NEVER EASY 
EXCELLENT AND DOES HE HAVE THE 
ANGLE TO KISS THE TWO REDS OUT IT 
IS NOT A NATURAL YOU CAN SEE HIM 
WANTING TO CUE DOWN ON IT LITTLE 
BIT FROM THAT ANGLE YOU WOULD 
THINK HE COULD GET CLOSE TO THE 
KISS MAYBE JUST NEEDS TO WIDEN IT 
A LITTLE BIT 
DIDN'T FEEL AS THOUGH HE COULD GET 
THE CANNON BUT MAYBE FEELS HE CAN 
SEE ENOUGH OF THE LEFT HAND OF THE 
TWO REDS TO PLAY IT INTO THE LEFT 
CORNER 
I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AS 
AN OPTION HE HIT IT TOO THICK SO 
HE COULD SEE PLENTY OF IT 
I SAID TOO THICK I MEANT TO THING 
TOO THIN 
THAT RED FOR HIS FIRST FRAME OF THE 
MATCH ANOTHER CHANCE GONE 
I THINK HE GOT A KICK THERE TO BE 
HONEST LET'S HAVE ANOTHER LOOK 
IT CERTAINLY SEEMED TO ME TO PUSH 
TOWARDS THE JAW CERTAINLY THE WAY 
HIS CUE CAME OUT AS IF HE GOT BAD CONTACT 
STILL CANNOT GET THAT RED AND THE 
LONGER IT TAKES THE MORE ANXIOUS 
HE WILL BECOME 
JOE LOOKING AT THE 
SCOREBOARD NOW WITH THE BLUE HE 
CAN ONLY TIE HE DECIDED TO GO FOR THE TIE 
CAN HE KNEW THIS THICK ENOUGH TO 
HOLD THE CUE BALL HIT THIS THICK 
ENOUGH 
JOE PERRY IS FATALLY ENSURED ALI 
CARTER THE THIRD FRAME HE HAS 
CONCEDED ALI CARTER WILL BE 
DELIGHTED 
WHAT SHOULD BE MAKE OF THOSE 
OPENING FOUR FRAMES 
I'M JUST 
WONDERING IF ALI CARTER REALISED IT 
IS THE INTERVAL HE WILL BE 
DELIGHTED AT GETTING HIS FIRST 
FRAME ON THE BALL YOU NEVER SETTLE 
UNLESS YOU GET THAT FIRST FRAME HE 
HAS LOOKED VERY EDGY ALI BUT 
EVERYTHING CAN CHANGE JOE HAS 
STARTED TO MISS A FEW AS WELL HE HE WILL BE HAPPY TO ONLY BE TEE PRINCE 
BEHIND INSTEAD OF FOUR TWO 
FRAMES 
IT IS A BIG OCCASION FOR FRAMES BOTH PLAYERS WHAT IS YOUR 
ASSESSMENT OF THE STANDARD 
IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO JUDGE IT WHAT YOU 
HAVE BEEN SEEING IS SENSATIONAL 
OVER THE LAST TEN DAYS OR SO ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
ATTEMPTS NEARLY EVERY MATCH THERE 
IS PLENTY OF TIME FOR THIS TO WARM 
UP IT COULD TAKE OFF IN THE NEXT 
SESSION 
I WAS WONDERING WINNER AT SESSION THE TOURNAMENT OVERALL PEOPLE ARE 
TELLING ME THEY'RE THINKING IT IS 
AS GOOD AS IT HAS BEEN FOR MANY 
YEARS 
I WAS OUT WITH CLIFF YEARS THORBURN THE OTHER DAY I HAD AN 
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD MAN HE TOLD ME THAT 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN SHOWED THEM 
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD MAN SO THE ATMOSPHERE 
AROUND SHEFFIELD IS FANTASTIC NO NO SURPRISE BECAUSE THE STRENGTH IN 
DEPTH OF PLAYERS THAT PLAY IN THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP FINALS IS FANTASTIC 
JUST TO QUALIFY IT IS REALLY HARD 
THE CHINESE BOY IS ONE FOR FIVE 
MATCHES TO GET HERE FANTASTIC 
PERFORMANCE JUST TO REACH THE 
CRUCIBLE 
FOUR MORE FRAMES TO COME CRUCIBLE FROM ALI CARTER AND JOE PERRY TIME 
NOW TO TURN OUR ATTENTION TO BEAT 
STEPHEN HENDRY AGAINST RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN SEMI FINAL IT IS NO 
SURPRISE THAT STEPHEN IS ALWAYS 
INTRODUCED AS THE KING OF THE 
CRUCIBLE 
IT MEANT MORE TO THE MEANT MORE 
THAN THE OTHER SIX PUT TOGETHER IT 
WAS MY BIGGEST ACHIEVEMENT MY 
GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT IN SNOOKER A 
HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT TO LOSE IN THE 
FINAL FRAME PROBABLY MY BIGGEST 
DISAPPOINTMENT IN SNOOKER LOSING 
THAT FINALLY PETER IS A FANTASTIC 
PLAYER AND I THINK NOW HE IS MUCH 
BETTER THAN HE WAS THEN DIDN'T 
BELIEVE HE COULD POSSIBLY BEAT ME 
OVER TWO DAYS 
IF YOU LET RONNIE GET ALI DON'T YOU 
YOU WILL STRUGGLE TO PICK HIM BACK 
GET A LEAD ON YOU IT WAS JUST A 
BAD MATCH FROM MORE LESS START TO 
FINISH FOR ME WOULDN'T SAY THAT 
IS THE CAUSE OF MIGHT DEMISE OVER 
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AT THE 
CRUCIBLE IT IS JUST BEEN PINNACLE 
THINGS AND BAD PLAY TECHNICAL 
THINGS OF COURSE I'M THINKING 
ABOUT WINNING IT THAT IS WHAT I'M 
HERE TO DO I'M NOT HERE TO FINISH 
SECOND IT IS THE ONLY REASON I'M 
IN SHEFFIELD TO WIN THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
BOTH PLAYERS ARE NO STRANGERS TO 
EACH OTHER THE STAND OUT MATCH WAS 
THAT OPTION BE SHIP SEMI FINAL FOUR 
YEARS AGO THE EARLY FRAMES WENT 
THE WAY OF STEPHEN HENDRY HE HAD A 
BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY AND THE FIRST FRAME 
IN FRAME FIVE RONNIE IS FORTY POINTS 
UP IN THIS TALE IS IN THE 
COMMENTARY BOX ALONGSIDE CLIVE 
EVERTON DENNIS TAYLOR 
HE MAY BE SNOOKER BUT I THINK HE 
COULD SMELL OF ROUND IT SWERVE 
IF HE CATCHES IT THIN THE WHITE 
WILL HEAD BACK UP TOWARDS THE GREEN 
THAT WAS A DOUBLE KISS TO POT THE 
WILL YELLOW 
LOOK AT THE SHORT 
HE IS FACED WITH IT IS A TOUGH ONE THAT IS VERY LUCKY VERY FORTUNATE 
TWO BITS OF GOOD RUNNING FOR HENDRY 
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES 
THEY FOUL AND A MISS 
STEPHEN HENDRY FOUR 
HE IS HAVING IT PUT BACK THAT 
SLICE OF GOOD FORTUNE MAY STILL 
GIVE STEPHEN HENDRY THIS FRAME 
HE CAN STILL PLAY THE TWO CUSHION 
ESCAPE HAS HE POTTED IT 
THE RANDOM RUNS OF THE BALL HAVE 
NOT GONE O'SULLIVAN'S WAY IN THIS 
FRAME 
IT IS STILL AT LEEDS TO WIN FOR 
INDY A CLEARANCE TO WIN FOR 
HENDRY THIS FOR FOUR POOLE FOUR TO ONE 
SOMEHOW STEPHEN HENDRY GOT THE 
BETTER OF THE LATTER EXCHANGES AND 
HAS TAKING THE FRAME ON THE BLACK 
TO EXTEND HIS 
TO FOUR TO ONE GREAT START FOR STEPHEN 
HENDRY IN FRAME SIX HE IS SIX 
POINTS UP PAST RULED POINTS UP 
TWELVE POINTS UP WHERE IS THE RED GOING TO FINISH 
HE MUSTN'T HAVE FANCIED THE SAFETY 
SHOT THERE HE IS FULL OF 
CONFIDENCE AT THE MOMENT HE HAS 
STUCK RONNIE WRIGHT IN HERE 
RONNIE RIGHT IN 
JUST LOOKING TO SEE WHAT IS 
AVAILABLE INTO THE LEFT CORNER 
POCKET WHICH WILL DECIDE 
NEEDS TO GO INTO THE REDS OR MORE 
HE WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE ON THIS 
ONE FOR THE WHITE TERRIFIC 
OPPORTUNITY NOW 
HE MADE A SIXTY FOUR BREAK IN THE LAST 
FRAME BUT DIDN'T WIN 
MAKES IT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT 
HE WINS THIS ONE 
HE DIDN'T GET THE CANNON AS HE 
INTENDED 
BUT THERE 
WAS ALWAYS 
GOING TO BE 
ANOTHER COUPLE OF REDS 
AVAILABLE HE COULD DO WITH KILLING 
THE FRAME OFF AT THIS VISIT 
ALL BEAUTIFULLY PLAYED LITTLE STUN 
AND SCREW SHOTS THE KEY TO BREAK 
BUILDING 
THIS IS JUST WHAT RONNIE 
NEEDED STEPHEN HENDRY TOOK ON WHEN 
LONG POT THE WAY THESE PLAYERS ARE 
CUEING IT COULD BE ONE MISTAKE AND 
YOU LOSE THE FRAME 
IN PEAK FORM 
THAT IS CERTAINLY THE CASE 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IS TAKING THESE 
WITH GREAT ASSURANCE 
THE YELLOW WAS SLIGHTLY PROTECTED 
BY THE BROWN THAT WAS BRILLIANTLY 
DONE 
YOU WILL KNOW SEE A BETTER DONE POSITION POSITIONAL SHOT THAN 
THAT TO GET ON THE YELLOW YOU 
WILL NOT SEE A WARMING UP NICELY 
THIS SEMI FINAL GREAT TO SEE BOTH 
PLAYERS CUEING WELL 
THEY ARE NOW WHAT STARTED SOMEWHAT 
UNCERTAINLY BOTH STARTED 
STEPHEN HENDRY TOOK THE OPENING 
FRAME WITH CLEARANCE OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN WON THE NEXT 
FRAME SO WE 
MOVE INTO 
THE FINAL 
FRAME OF THE SESSION STEPHEN 
HENDRY TO PLAY 
HE HAS HAD A GO AT 
THE DOUBLE THAT WAS ALWAYS THE 
PROBLEM L. DO NOT KNOW WHY STEPHEN 
NEVER LOOKED AT THAT HE JUST 
THOUGHT ABOUT THE DOUBLE 
HE IT WAS 
A NATURAL ANGLE AS IT PROVED 
HENDRY HAS ONLY HIMSELF TO BLAME 
FOR NOT RECOGNISING IT 
IF HE HAS LEFT HIMSELF STRAIGHT ON 
THE BLUE THAT WAS A TERRIBLE SHORT 
SHOT 
WE HAVE HAD A ONE HUNDRED FORTY CLEARANCE FROM 
HENDRY 
WE HAVE HAD A FEW MISTAKES TO SPICE 
THINGS UP 
AND SOME PRETTY GOOD 
TACTICAL PLAY WE HAVE HAD THE LOT 
THIS AFTERNOON 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN TRAILED FOUR TO ONE BUT 
TOOK THE REMAINING THREE FRAMES TO 
LEVEL AT FOUR TO FOUR OVERNIGHT 
THE NEXT EIGHT FRAMES TOMORROW 
MORNING AVAILABLE BY THE RED BUTTON 
HOW SHOULD BOTH PLAYERS YOU THAT 
FRAME 
RONNIE WILL BE MORE FRAME DELIGHTED THAN STEPHEN STEPHEN GOT 
OFF TO THAT ONE HUNDRED FORTY BREAK IN THE 
OPENING FRAME 
WITH LOOK TO 
BE BACK 
TO 
HIS BEST 
BUT 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN 
MUST BE 
DELIGHTED TO 
BE GOING IN AT 
FOUR TO FOUR WHEN YOU'RE FOUR TO ONE UP YOU WOULD 
BE DISAPPOINTED 
NOT TO 
WIN ONE 
THE EXTREMES WELL 
STEPHEN THINK 
THE EXTREMES WELL STEPHEN THINK THAT WAS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY HE HE IS NOT PLAYING CATCH UP YOU CAN 
END UP PLAYING CATCH UP 
BACK TO 
THE ALI CARTER JOE PERRY SEMI FINAL 
ONE OF THE FIRST OF FOUR SCHEDULED 
SESSIONS WILLIE THORNE AND JOHN 
VIRGO IN POLICE IN THE COMMENTARY 
BOX IN PLACE 
WE ARE BACK WITH THE RITUAL OF 
FILLING UP THE GLASS 
YOU WOULD PUT 
THE CASE IN WHEN PEOPLE WERE ON A 
SHORT 
IT WAS JUST A FUN GAME WITH SHORT THE REARDON THERE IS NOTHING AT 
STAKE WITH RAY REARDON IT IS 
FUNNY HOW THE NAME REARDON AND STAKES GO TO GO THERE TOGETHER 
NOT A BAD BREAK OFF ALI'S SAFETY 
HAS NOT BEEN AS GOOD AS HE WOULD 
LIKE YOU 
HAVE GOT 
TO TRY 
AND FORCE 
A MISTAKE FROM YOUR OPPONENT IT IS 
NOT GOOD ENOUGH 
AND I THINK I KNOW WHO THEY ARE 
SUPPORTING 
OBVIOUSLY ALI CARTER SUPPORTING FANS THEY WILL BE HOPING THAT THEY 
ARE MAN GETS HIS POTTING BOOTS BECAUSE AT 
THE MOMENT 
HE IS 
BEING 
KEPT OFF THE TABLE HE 
HAD A 
CHANCES IN 
FRAME FOUR 
AND DID NOT 
TAKE THEM THERE IS A BIRD'S EYE VIEW 
IT WAS A DANGEROUS SPORT NO 
GUARANTEE OF POSITION DANGEROUS 
SPORT POT THERE IS LITTLE BIT 
OF ANXIETY KEEPING AN EYE 
CREEPING IN YOU ARE ALWAYS LOOKING 
FOR A GOOD 
START AND 
IF YOU DO 
GET IT YOU CAN BECOME ANXIOUS 
JOE PERRY IS O. K. BECAUSE HE CAN GET 
THROUGH THE TWO REDS IT WOULD BEEN 
TOUGHER IF 
HE HAD BEEN 
THE TOP OF ONE OF THEM 
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HE HAS THE RIGHT 
ANGLE ON THE BLACK TO SCREW BACK 
FOR THE 
RIGHT HAND 
POCKET 
HE HAS 
TO 
GO OFF 
THE 
CUSHION AND 
TRY AND 
MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN IT IS HARD 
TO EXPLAIN THIS JOE IS ONE THOSE 
PLAYERS THAT 
DOES 
NOT SEEM 
GENERATE SPEED 
WHEN GOING INTO THE 
GENERATE SPEED WHEN GOING INTO THE PACK WHY IS THAT 
HE DOES NOT GET 
THROUGH THE BALL HE JABS ON THAT 
TYPE OF SHOT THE CUE BALL IS GOING 
TO SWING WIDE OF THE MARK RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN DOES 
NOT STOP AT 
THE 
BALL BUT GOES RIGHT THROUGH IT JOE 
IS MORE OF A PUNCTURE PUNCHER 
WHEN YOU SEE PLAYERS POLICE SCREW 
SHOTS YOU SEE THE THE WHITE GO 
TWICE INTO THE REDS 
HAVE PUT SCREW 
ON THE BALL SO WELL 
HAS HE SORTED OUT A PLANT THERE IS 
NO SAFETY ON THE BAULK END IT IS 
NOT A PLANT FOR ME HE CANNOT LEAVE 
THIS IN 
BAULK BECAUSE 
OF THE 
RED 
THAT IS ALREADY THERE HE IS JUST 
LEAVING IT NEAR THE MIDDLE POCKET 
BUT IF ALI CAN GET PAST THE BROWN 
IT 
IS AN 
EASY SAFETY SHOT OFF 
RED ON TO THE BAULK CUSHION 
JOE IS USUALLY VERY PROFICIENT IN 
THE SAFETY DEPARTMENT 
JOE HAS BEEN FORTUNATE BUT IT WAS 
A DISAPPOINTING SHORT BEFORE THAT 
THAT IS THE FIRST POOR SAFETY HE 
HAS PLAYED FOR SOME TIME 
HE JUST WANTS TO GET HIS HAND AND 
THE TABLE NICELY AND MAKE 
SIZEABLE BREAK HE HAS NOT MADE ONE 
YET 
EVEN THOUGH HE HAS GOT A FRAME ON 
THE BOARD WHOSE HIGHEST BREAK IS 
JUST OVER TWENTY YOU 
DO NOT 
REALLY GET 
CONFIDENT UNTIL 
YOU GET 
AT LEAST 
SIXTY BREAK AND GET YOUR CUE ARM GOING 
WHEN THE BLACK GOES ON ITS SPOT 
HERE HE SHOULD NOT BE TOO FAR AWAY 
I CAN SEE FORTY TO FIFTY COMING IN HERE 
HE IS ON THIS RED TO THE RIGHT 
CORNER HE COULD PLAY FOR THE BLACK 
IN THE SAME POCKET HE MUST BE 
PERFECT THIS IS A CHANCE TO GET 
THE BLACK 
ON ITS 
SPOT THIS 
IS A 
GOOD CHANCE NOW 
HE HAS A CHOICE HE CAN CANNON INTO 
THE REDS OR PIQUANTLY IN OFF THE 
BLACK PLAY IN OFF HE HAS GONE 
IN FAIRNESS A LITTLE BIT TOO HARRY 
HIGH THERE IS POOR SHOT HE HAS PLAYED 
BECAUSE HE CANNOT 
GET THE 
PLAYED BECAUSE HE CANNOT GET THE KISS ON THE MIDDLE RED 
IN THE END AS YOU SAY HE 
WENT WRONG BUT IT HAS WORKED OUT 
PERFECTLY FOR AND WHO IT WAS A 
GOOD CHANCE A 
FEW SHOTS 
AGO IT 
IS 
A BETTER 
ONE NOW 
IT IS AMAZING 
A BETTER ONE NOW IT IS AMAZING WHEN YOU PLAY A 
BAD SHOT 
THEN YOU 
ARE FORCED INTO 
PLAYING 
AGGRESSIVE 
SHOT AND 
IT CAN 
COME 
OUT NICELY FOR YOU 
THIS TIME POTTING THE BLACK HE 
CAN PLAY CANNON ON THE RED JUST 
IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE BLACK LEAD 
THAT NICELY YOU FEEL AS THOUGH BY 
PLAYING BACK YOU LOSE THAT RED BY 
KNOCKING 
IT CLOSE 
TO 
THE CUSHION 
BUT HE 
HAS GOT 
OTHER REDS TO PLAY 
FOR 
THE ONE BELOW THE PINK IS 
DEFINITELY ON TO 
THE SAME 
POCKET AS 
HE HAS 
POTTED THE BLACK INTO THIS IS MORE LIKE THE ALI 
CARTER WE 
HAVE BEEN WATCHING ALL LOOKING VERY FLUENT 
ROUND THE TABLE 
HIS CONFIDENCE 
HAS 
GROWN SINCE 
GETTING THAT 
OPENING FRAME ON THE 
BOARD 
HE DIDN'T WIN THAT FRAME WITH STYLE 
BUT JUST TO GET THAT 
FRAME ON 
THE 
SCOREBOARD IT 
IS AMAZING 
HOW IT 
SETTLES 
YOU YOU FEEL 
PART OF THE 
MATCH YOU WOULD NOT 
WANT TO 
PLAY FOR ONE 
OF THESE REDS ALONG THE TOP CUSHION 
BUT I THINK 
HE HAS 
TO PLAY FOR ONE 
OF THEM 
WHEN THEY ARE JUST OFF THE CUSHION 
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY ACCURATE 
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO SEE THAT HE HAD 
MISSED IT 
ANY MORE PACE AND IT 
WOULD NOT HAVE GONE IN 
IT SHOWS 
YOU HOW MOVING THE TABLE AND 
RECOVERING IT CAN MAKE THE 
DIFFERENCE THAT 
WOULD HAVE 
BEEN 
MISSED EARLIER IN THE WEEK YOU THAT WHEN 
YOU GET 
NEW CLOTH ON THE 
CUSHIONS UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESN'T 
LAST FOR LONG 
FIFTY FOUR AHEAD HE WILL NEED ONE MORE RED 
HE'S JUST CHECKING THE SCOREBOARD 
THERE IS A POSSIBLE FIFTY NINE LEFT ON THE 
TABLE 
IN HIS FIRST REAL SCORING TABLE CHANCE HE HAS MADE THE BREAK OF THE MATCH SO FAR 
WHAT DOES THAT ONE RED FROM NOW 
WHERE DOES THAT ONE MADE COME FROM 
NOW MINUS ONE RED JOE PERRY HAS A GLIMMER 
OF HOPE 
THIS 
FRAME BUT IT 
LOOKS LIKE 
LEAD HE'S 
GOING 
TO BE 
REDUCED TO 
JUST THE LUCK JUST ONE 
ALI CARTER IS ON HIS WAY TO MAKING 
IT THREE TO TWO THIS 
IS WHERE 
WE HAVE TO 
LEAVE IT 
ON B. B. C. 
TWO YOU 
CAN SEE 
THE 
REST OF 
THE SESSION BY PRESSING THE RED BUTTON FROM THE FROM B. B. C. TWO BYE BYE FOR NOW
