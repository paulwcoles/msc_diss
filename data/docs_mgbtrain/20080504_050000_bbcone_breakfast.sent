NOW THE RISING PRICE OF OIL IN THE 
U. S. HAS SPARKED A BOOM IN NATURAL 
GAS GAS DAVID WILLETS IS IN COLORADO 
LOOKING AT THE HEALTH COSTS OF 
DRILLING HERE IS THIS WEEK'S 
REPORTERS 
RISING ENERGY PRICES SPUR A 
DRILLING BOOM IN AMERICA'S WEST 
BUT AS DAVID WILLETS FINDS THERE 
IS ANOTHER PRICE TO BE PAID IN 
HUMAN HEALTH 
SO THE BLIND MAY SEE PALLAB GHOSH 
ON THE AMAZING ADVANCES OF GENE 
THERAPY THAT COULD BRING BETTER 
SIGHT TO MILLIONS 
A WARM WELCOME TO REPORTERS 
THERE IS A NEW GOLD RUSH IN 
AMERICA'S WILD WEST THIS TIME 
SEARCHING FOR PRECIOUS ENERGY NOT 
METAL GAS PRICES HAVE TRIGGERED A 
PUSH TO FIND NEW RESOURCES PARTS 
OF THE U. S. MEANS THAT NATURAL GAS IS 
PROVIDING A FINANCIAL BOOM MORE 
THAN THIRTY THREE THOUSAND AREAS ARE PUMPING 
BILLIONS OF GAS 
BUT AT WHAT COST IN COLORADO THEY 
ARE TALKING ABOUT THEIR HEALTH 
PROBLEMS BEING LINKED LINKED TO 
THE DRILLING 
FOUR YEARS AGO THEY HAD IT ALL TO 
THEMSELVES NOW COLORADO'S COWS 
HAVE THE COMPANY OF MORE THAN 
THIRTY THOUSAND DRILLED WELLS 
A FIVE MILLION ACRE GOLD RUSH BORN 
OUT OF THE RISING PRICE OF OIL AND 
GAS AND AMERICA'S SEEMINGLY 
INSATIABLE DEMAND FOR FUEL 
RANCHERS LIKE ROY SAVAGE HAVING 
HANDED THEIR LAND OVER TO THE 
ENERGY COMPANIES IN RETURN FOR A 
SHARE OF THE SPOILS 
YOU HAVE HIT THE JACKPOT CERTAINLY CERTAINLY A FEW YEARS AGO THIS FARM AND 
OTHERS LIKE IT WERE ON THEIR NIECE 
NOW DIFFERENT BEAST FEEDS OFF THE 
FAT OF THE LAND 
THIS DRILL HAS SIXTEEN GAS WELLS FROM 
ONE LOCATION THEY COST ABOUT TWO DOLLARS 
MILLION TO DRILL AND DEVELOPE THEY 
WILL PRODUCE EACH WELL GAS 
DEPENDING ON A PRICE OF MILLION DOLLARS 
PER WELL THAT IS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS 
MILLION FROM THIS LITTLE LOCATION 
BUT NOT EVERYONE HERE IS REAPING 
THE BENEFIT A FEW MONTHS AGO 
REPORT WAS COME PILED BY THE 
COLORADO HEALTH OFFICIALS THAT 
LOOKED AT THE IMPACT OF THE 
DRILLING ON PUBLIC HEALTH THEY 
FOUND IN SOME AREAS WHERE THE 
STKPWAS DEVELOPED THE RISK OF 
CANCER EXCEED OR ARE EQUAL TO THE 
UPPER END OF THE ACCEPTABLE RISK 
RANGE SET BY THE GOVERNMENT BUT 
THEY POINT OUT THAT THE REPORT IS 
SNAPSHOT THAT FUTURE RISK COULD BE 
UNDERESTIMATED ONE PERSON TOLD THE 
B. B. C. THERE IS HIGH CONCERN ABOUT THE 
LEVEL OF BENZENE IN THE AREA THAT 
CAN CAUSE LEUKAEMIA YET AS THE 
DRILLING HAS MOVED TO WITHIN A FEW 
FEET OF PEOPLE'S HOMES THE 
EVIDENCE IS PILING UP MEET RICK 
HIS HOUSE IS LOOKING OVER A SEA OF 
GAS TANKS EACH BEARING SUITABLY 
CHILLING WARNING OF THE DANGERS 
THAT THEY POSE 
WE HAVE NINETEEN WELLS ON THE PROPERTY 
ALL OF THEM ARE WITHIN THREE HUNDRED YARDS OF 
THE HOUSE HE POINTS TO BLOOD TESTS 
AS EVIDENCE HE IS BEING POISONED 
IT SHOWS I AM POSITIVE WITH 
SUBSTANCES THAT SHOULD NOT BE IN 
YOUR BODY THIS SHOULD BE IN THE 
TANK OF YOUR CAR L. 
HAVE STARTED TO HAVE TROUBLE IN THE SPRAINGED 
SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND FOUR DIFFERENT PARTS OF 
MY BODY WERE SHUTTING DOWN THE 
ARMS WOULD NOT WORK THE LEGS WOULD 
NOT WORK BY OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND FOUR MY BODY 
SHUT DOWN 
HE HAS NOT WORKED FULL TIME SINCE 
THERE IS NO WORK YOU CAN DO LIKE 
THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I 
JUST SURVIVE AS LONG AS I CAN 
SURVIVE I WILL BE O. K. 
DRILLING GOT UNDER WAY OUTSIDE OF 
DEE'S HOME THE DAY SHE MOVED IN 
I WAS NOT IN THE HOUSE FOR FIFTEEN 
MINUTES WHEN I GOT OFF THE CHAIR 
AND PASSED OUT 
BECAUSE THE OF THE FUMES 
I MUST 
HAVE INHALED TOO MUCH 
SHE RETURNED AFTER SPENDING EIGHT 
MONTHS AT HER DAUGHTER'S HOUSE TO 
BE CONFRONTED BY THIS ONE OF THE 
TANKS HAD EXPLODED 
LIKE MANY COLORADO RESIDENTS BE 
DEE MAY OWN THE PROPERTY BUT WHAT 
LIES BENEATH IT BELONGS TO THE 
GOVERNMENT IT LEAVES HER PUERGLESS 
TO GET INVOLVED ON WHAT TAKES PLACE 
ON HER LAND 
I SPEND A LOT OF TIME CRYING 
OVER LOSING MY HOME SORRY 
AS THE EXPANSION CONTINUES MORE 
THAN TWENTY OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN THE 
SHADOW OF THE RIGS HAVE COME 
FORWARD TO REPORT STOMS SIMILAR TO 
THOSE OFKM RICK AND DEE 
STOMS SUCH AS HEADACHES SYMPTOMS 
SUCH AS HEADACHES AND RASHES AND 
ASTHMA ASTHMA SUSANNE WORKS FOR ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST PLAYERS IN TOWN SHE SEES 
NO REASON TO AMEND THE OPERATING 
PRACTISES AS THERE IS NO LINK 
BETWEEN THE DRILLING AND THE 
DISEASE DISEASE AS FAR AS THE AIR QUALITY IS 
CONCERNED I BELIEVE THAT OUR 
COMPANY IS GETTING BETTER AT WHAT 
WE DO THE TECHNOLOGY IS GETTING 
BETTER WE ARE USING THE BEST 
TECHNOLOGY POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE 
THAT WE DO NOT EXCEED OUR PERMIT 
STANDARDS STANDARDS BUT THE CANCER RISKS ARE AT OR 
ABOVE THE ACCEPTABLE RANGE IS THAT 
NOT WORRYING 
I AM NOT GOING TO 
STPOND THAT 
BUT CONCERNS ARE NOT CONFINED TO 
THE AIR 
ON ITS WAY THROUGH TWENTY MILES OF 
HILLS AND FORESTS THE CREEK HERE 
IS THE MAIN SOURCE OF DRINKING 
WATER FOR TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE FOUR YEARS 
AGO ANOTHER ENERGY COMPANY WAS 
DRILLING HERE WHEN BENZENE LEAKED 
INTO THE RIVER STILL NOTHING 
GROWS THERE THE LOCALS HAVE TAKEN 
TO VENTING THEIR FRUSTRATION IN 
SONG SONG 
WHEN THEY DRILLED MY RANCH 
THEY SUCKED MY GAS THEY BULLDOZED MY HOMESTEAD TOO DL DL THIS IS CALLED BLUE GRASS BLUES 
HOW DID THEY POISON MY WATER 
MY DRILLING FOR GAS IN THE GROUND SCIENTISTS SHARE THE CONCERNS 
POINTING OUT THERE HAS BEEN NO 
STUDY OF THE HEALTH EFFECTS ON THE 
LOCAL PEOPLE 
WE HAVE COMPLAINTS BUT NOT DATA NO 
EVALUATION NO FORWARD LOOKING 
STUDY AS TO WHAT IS GOING ON 
WHY NOT 
THERE ARE NO FUNDS NO 
WILL NO ORGANISATION 
SOME SAY THAT THE ENERGY RESERVES 
HERE COULD DWARL THOSE OF SAUDI 
ARABIA THAT THE DRILLING COULD 
DOUBLE FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND 
CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER THIRTY BUT THE 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS INTEND 
TO CONFINE FUTURE AIR MONITORING TO 
AREAS RAISING CAUSE FOR CONCERN 
THE ENERGY COMPANIES ARE MAKING 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN COLORADO 
YET THERE IS NOT THE MONEY TO 
RESEARCH THE EFFECT THEY ARE HAVING 
ON THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE 
BY DRILL ARE FOR GAS IN THE 
GROUND 
FOR THE FIRST TIME BRITISH 
SCIENTISTS HAVE MANAGED TO REVERSE 
NEAR BLINDNESS IN BRUEING GIVING 
HOPES TO MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD 
THE SCIENTISTS USED AGAIN THERAPY 
TO DETECT LIGHT DETECTING CELLS 
BEHIND THE RETINA 
SIX MONTHS AGO STEEFN COULD HARDLY 
SEE IN THE DARK NOW THANKS TO A 
REMARKABLE OPERATION HIS SIGHT HAS 
BEGUN TO GET BETTER TESTS IN THE 
DIMLY LIT MAIZE SHOW AN AMAZING 
IMPROVEMENT AFTER THE OPERATION HE 
KEEPS BUMPING INTO THE WALLS IT 
TAKES HIM ONE MINUTE AND SEVENTEEN SECONDS 
TO GET TOT END BUT SIX MONTHS 
LATER HE GOES STRAIGHT THROUGH 
MY SOCIAL LIFE HAS IMPROVED NOT 
MUCH BUT SLIGHTLY L. CAN DO MORE 
THAN WHAT I USED TO 
I HAVE MORE SOFT CONFIDENCE 
STEPHEN'S EYESIGHT WAS FAILING 
BECAUSE OF FAULTY GENE THE 
SURGEONS AT HOSPITAL INJECTED GOOD 
COPIES OF THE GENE INTO THE BACK OF 
STEPHEN'S EYE THE REPLACEMENT GENE 
HAVE HEALED THE DYING CELLS AND 
IMPROVED STEPHEN'S SIGHT 
THE RESEARCHERS HOPE TO TRY OUT 
GENE THERAPY ON CHILDREN THEY HOPE 
IT WILL HELP THEM TOO SO THEY CAN 
GROW GROW UP AND LEAD THEIR 
LEAVES TO FULL POTENTIAL 
THIS BOY HOPES HE IS TO BE PICKED 
FOR THE NEXT PHASE OF THE TRIAL SO 
HE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE BETTER AT 
NIGHT NIGHT WHEN I GO TO SAINSBURY WITH MY MUM 
I CAN TAKE THE TROLLY BACK FOR HER 
YOU WOULD LIKE TO HELP YOUR MUM A 
BIT MORE YES YES THE BYS BOTH SUFFERED FROM RARE 
GENETIC DISEASE THAT AFFECTS A 
F. E. W. ZERO ZERO PEOPLE IN BRITAIN BUT THE 
SURGEONS BELIEVE THAT THE THERAPY 
COULD BE USED TO TREAT WIDER 
RANGE OF DISORDERS POSSIBLY TO 
EVEN SLOW OR STOP AGE RELATED 
BLINDNESS BLINDNESS THIS IS A PROOF THAT GENE THERAPY 
CAN WORK FOR A PARTICULAR HIGH 
DISORDER WE HOPE THAT A SIMILAR 
TECHNOLOGY COULD BE USED FOR OTHER 
INHERITED DISEASES AND OTHER COMMON 
DISEASES DISEASES IT IS EARLY DAYS FOR THE RESEARCH 
BUT THE RESULTS ARE PROPLG THE 
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IS CONSIDERING 
EXTENDING THE TRIALS TO COVER MORE 
TIME TYPES OF EYE DISEASES 
THAT IS ALL FROM REPORTERS FOR THIS

HIGHS 
NOW AN UNDERGROUND CITY WHERE 
THOUSANDS OF BRITISH SOLDIERS WERE 
HOUSED IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR HAS 
BEEN PARTIALY REBUILT 
IN ARRAS IN FRANCE THE TUNNELS 
WERE USED TO PROTECT UP TO TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND 
TROOPS FROM GERMAN BOMBARDMENT 
A SECRET CITY HIDDEN SIXTY FEET UNDER 
THE GROUND THE TUNNELS WERE PART 
OF MEDIEVAL QUARRIES BUT NINETY ONE YEARS 
AGO THEY BECAME THE HOME TO TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND 
BRITISH AND COMMONWEALTH SOLDIERS 
THERE WERE TWELVE MILES OF 
INTERCONNECTING TUNNELS HERE BUT 
DESPITE THE SOPHISTICATED ENGINEER 
IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN VERY 
COMFORTABLE FOR THE SOLDIERS 
WAITING TO GO TO WAR IT IS COLD 
IT IS DAMP OF COURSE IT IS PRETTY 
DARK DARK DURING THE EIGHT DAYS THEY SPENT 
TIME WAITING 
PART OF THE TUNNEL 
NETWORK HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A 
MUSEUM THE VISITORS GET AN INSIGHT 
INTO THE LIFE ON THE WESTERN FRONT 
THE NETWORK WAS A KIND OF TOWN A 
REAL TOWN BENEATH THE CITY OF ARRAS 
THEY HAD ELECTRICITY A SURGICAL 
THEATRE WITH AN ENTIRE HOSPITAL 
THAT COULD HOUSE UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED SOLDIERS 
THEY HAD COOK HOUSES POST BOX 
FOR THE SOLDIERS TO LEAVE A LETTER 
BEFORE THEY WENT OVER THE TOP 
WHEN THE WAR ENDED THE TUNNELS 
WERE SEALED UP AGAIN AND FORGOTTEN 
A FEW YEARS AGO THIS MAN EXPLORED 
THE QUARRIES AND FOUND THE TELL 
TALE SIGNS OF ARMY LIFE 
WE FOUND FOUR THOUSAND WRITINGS BUT IT IS 
POSSIBLE TO SEE ONE HERE 
THIS IS BELONGING TO THE THIRD 
DIVISION HERE IT IS THE NINTH OF 
APRIL THE BEGINNING OF THE BATTLE 
OF ARRAS 
SOME OF THE SOLDIERS WERE ARTISTS 
AND TOOK PRIDE IN LEAVING THEIR 
MARK OTHERS HASTILY SCRATCHED 
THEIR INITIALS WHO KNOWS HOW MANY 
OF THEM MADE IT 
ON APRIL THE NINTH NINETEEN SEVENTEEN THE TROOPS 
WERE MARCHED HERE TO EXIT TEN AT 
LAST MINUTE THEY WERE ORDERED TO 
TAKE OFF THEIR GREAT COATS WHEN 
THE HATCH WAS LIFTED THEY SAW IT 
WAS SNOWING 
THE LOCAL SMETARY BEST TELLS THE 
STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED TO MANY OF 
THE SOLDIERS THE MUSEUM HOPES TO 
PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF THE FALLEN 
FOR GENERATIONS TO COME 
A FASCINATING STORY THIS IS 
BREAKFAST NOW FROM PROMISES OF

MAIL BUT SPAM E. MAILS ACCOUNT FOR 
FOURTEEN BILLION MESSAGES EACH DAY THE 
AVERAGE OFFICE WORKERS SPENDS THREE

DEALING WITH THE E. MAILS IT IS 
ESTIMATED THAT TWO HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS ARE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE WORLD'S 
SPAM SPAM ADRIAN MARS IS A TECHNOLOGY 
SPECIALIST ONLY A COUPLE OF HUNT 
PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS STUFF 
WHERE ARE THEY 
A LOT ARE IN 
AMERICA BUT PRETTY WELL SPREAD 
AROUND THE WORLD THE FACT THAT 
THEY ARE NOT IN COUNTRIES THAT ARE 
HARD TO GET IT SUGGESTS WE ARE ONLY 
AT THE START OF GETTING THESE SWINE 
YOU KNOW YOU WOULD EXPECT THEM TO 
MOVE TO COUNTRIES LIKE RUSSIA 
WHERE THE FORCES OF LAW ARE A 
LITTLE HARDER BUT AT THE MOMENT 
THEY ARE PRETTY WELL SPREAD AROUND 
THE WORLD THE MAJORITY ARE IN THE 
STATES STATES WHEN THEY ARE CAUGHT OR UNVEILED 
THESE PEOPLE WHY ARE THEY DOING 
IT FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES 
THEY ARE 
DOING IT FOR MONEY THEY ARE 
GETTING PAID SEVERAL HUNDREDS OF 
POUNDS FOR SPAM 
FOR WHAT PURPOSE 
THESE THINGS MAKE 
MONEY BELIEVE IT OR NOT AS IT 
ONLY COSTS THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY 
TO SEND ONE E. MAIL AS TO SEND 
MILLIONS IT TAKES ONE IN ONE THOUSAND FOR 
THOSE TO RESPOND TO A MESSAGE THEN 
IT IS PROFITABLE IT IS ABUSING THE 
WAY THAT THE INTERNET WORKS 
SO WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT 
OURSELVES IF WE RESPOND TO IT IN

REASON TO SEND MORE ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY THEY ARE MORE CUNNING THE LATEST 
SPAM AS THEY ARE HARVESTING E. 
MAILS FROM INFECTED COMPUTERS

SALESMAN AS HE WAS ACCUSED OF 
BEING GUY GORDON BROWN THEY WILL 
HOPE IN THE COME C. K. MONTHS AND 
YEARS THAT THIS WILL BE EXPOSED 
THIS DIFFERENCE AND PEOPLE WILL 
PLUMP FOR THE MORE SERIOUS 
CHARACTER 
A LITTLE BIT ON CAMERON CHARACTER AND BORIS JOHNSON HOW ARE THOSE TWO 
THINGS GOING TO PLAY OFF EACH OTHER 
TWOFPLT POLITICIANS IN KEY ROLES 
IT WILL BE INTERESTING BORIS 
JOHNSON IS THE MOST POWERFUL 
CONSERVATIVE IN THE LAND THE 
BIGGEST VICTORY FOR THE TORIES 
SINCE ONE NINE NINE NINE TWO IT WILL BE INTERESTING 
WHAT BORIS JOHNSON DOES WITH THAT 
POWER WILL HE BE DICTATE TO BY 
TORY CENTRAL OFFICE DAVID CAMERON 
SAID WE WILL BE HERE IF HE NEEDS 
HELP HE IS AN INDEPENDENT MAN SOME 
PEOPLE SAY HE IS LOOSE CANON 
TORIES SUGGEST THEY WILL USE LONDON 
TO TRY OUT THEIR POLICIES TO PROVE 
THEY ARE READY FOR OFFICE AT 
NATIONAL LEVEL THE RISK BEING 
THERE WILL BE FALLINGS OUT IF YOU 
LIKE DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN BORIS 
JOHNSON AND DAVID CAMERON THAT WILL 
A. B. TRICKY ONE FOR THEM TO PULL OFF 
FOR THE MOMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
GORDON BROWN WILL BE TALKING 
TALKING TO ANDREW MARR ON B. B. C. ONE 
AFTER NINE HUNDRED A M. THIS MORNING 
THE HEADLINES GORDON BROWN IS 
BEGINNING HIS FIGHT BACK AFTER 
LABOUR'S DISASTROUS SHOWING IN LAST 
WEEK'S LOCAL ELECTIONS POLICE IN 
SCOTLAND ARE INVESTIGATING THE 
DEATHS TWO OF YOUNG BOYS FOUND IN A 
CAR NEAR GLASGOW STILL TO COME 
WHAT SAFER BUILDINGS COULD YOU GO 
INTO FOR HELP SHOPS SHOPS WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHO IT IS SAFE 
TO TALK TO WITH CHILDREN 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE WHRR 
WEATHER WITH MATT 
DESPITE THE FACT THAT MOST OF US 
WILL LIE UNDER CLOUDY SKIES IT 
WILL BE WARM WE HAVE VERY MILD 
NOTE IN SOME PARTS THE WARMTH 
CONTINUING BUT IT IS DAY WHERE 
YOU ARE MOST LIKELY TO SEE THE RAIN 
THIS BANK HOLIDAY WEEKEND 
THERE ARE PLUMES OF WATER RUNNING 
UP FROM THE BAY OF BIFBGAWAY A FEW 
COULD PUSH UP INTO THE NORTHERN 
PARTS OF CORNWALL AND DEVON SOME 
DRY WEATHER AS WELL BUT ACROSS THE 
EASTERN PARTS OF WALES INTO 
HEREFORDSHIRE SHROPSHIRE THERE IS 
THUNDER TO COME HEAVY RAIN IN THE 
EAST OF NORTHERN IRELAND IN THE 
WEST DRY THE SKIES BRIGHTENING BY 
MIDMORNING ACROSS SCOTLAND THE 
CLOUDIER SKIES BREEZE FROM THE 
SOUTH EAST MOST PLACES DRY THOUGH 
THE RAIN HIT AND MISS BUT FROM THE 
BORDERS DOWN TOWARDS CUMBRIA AND 
LANCASHIRE THERE IS A POTENTIAL 
FOR THUNDER STORMS THE RAINS WILL 
COME AND GO LIGHT AND PATCHY 
NOTHING MORE THAN WOUN OR TWO SPOTS 
DRY IN THE SOUTH EAST AND EAST 
ANGLIA HERE FEW GLIMMERS OF 
BRIGHTNESS CLOUDY SKIES FOR THE 
MOST PART BETTER SUNSHINE IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND A ZONE OF CLOUDY 
WEATHER IN SCOTLAND NORTH WEST 
ENGLAND INTO THE EAST OF WALES AND 
THE SOUTH WEST TEMPERATURES STILL 
FIFTEEN DEGREES TO TWENTY DEGREES AT LORDS 
IT WILL BE PLEASANT BUT FOR OTHER 
ONE DAY CRICKET MATCHES AT OLD 
TRAFFORD AND TRENT BRIDGE THERE 
COULD BE INTERRUPTIONS FOR RAIN 
RAIN CONTINUING IN EASTERN ENGLAND 
AND SCOTLAND HEAVY FOR A TIME 
EASING OFF LATER ON IN THE WEST 
DRY MISTY AND MURKY AROUND THE 
IRISH SEA AND CELTIC SEA AND COOLER 
IN THAN RECENT NIGHTS TEMPERATURE 
DOWN TO EIGHT DEGREES 
BANK HOLIDAY MONDAY CLOUDY IN 
CENTRAL AND EASTERN ENGLAND WITH 
PATCHY RAIN ONE OR TWO SHOWERS IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES BRIGHTER SKYS IN 
THE SOUTH EAST WITH SUNSHINE 
WESTERN AREAS DRY AND BRIGHT BUT 
FOG LURKING AROUND THE COASTAL 
PARTS OF WALES TUESDAY LOOKING DRY 
AND BRIGHT AND WARM AT UP TO TWENTY ONE 
DEGREES 
DEGREES DEGREES WHO DO YOU TRUST IT IS DIFFICULT 
ENOUGH FOR ADULTS IT IS HARDER FOR 
CHILDREN THEY ARE TOLD NOT TO TALK 
TO STRANGERS BUT IN A DIFFICULT 
SITUATION A STRANGER COULD BE THE 
BEST PERSON TO TALK TO THE SAFER 
STRANGERS SAFER BUILDINGS CAMPAIGN 
IDENTIFIES FOR CHILDREN THE BEST 
STRANGER TO TALK TO 
WHEN I CAME HERE WAS I A STRANGER 
THEN YES THEN YES I WAS WHAT YOU CALL SAFER 
STRANGER CAN ANYBODY TELL ME WHAT 
THEY THINK IT MEEPS 
IT IS WHEN YOU 
MAY NOT HAVE MET THEM BUT IF THEY 
ARE IN UNIFORM OR HAVE A BADGE YOU 
KNOW YOU CAN TRUST THEM PRETTY MUCH 
BRILLIANT A VERY VERY GOOD ANSWER 
SO A SAFER STRANGER IS SOMEBODY WHO 
DOES A JOB WHERE THEY HAVE 
SPECIAL IDENTITY 
IS THERE ANY OTHER SAFER STRANGER 
A FIREMAN 
DEFINITELY WE COULD GET HELP FROM 
THEM 
A DOCTOR THEM BRILLIANT A DOCTOR IN A SURGERY OR 
A HOSPITAL BRILLIANT THEY ARE 
THERE TO HELP US TO MAKE US BETTER 
A PARAMEDIC 
EXCELLENT EXCELLENT INTERESTING THEIR ANSWERS 
SALLY GIMSON IS FROM THE FAMILY AND 
PARENTING INSTITUTE STEVEN GAUGE 
IS FROM THE MAIDSTONE AND TUNBRIDGE 
WELLS TRUST THAT RAISES AWARENESS 
OF PERSONAL SAFETY STEVEN SUZY 
WORKS FOR THE TRUST ALL THE 
SUGGESTION THERE IS THAT YOU COULD 
GO TO SOMEONE IN UNIFORM SOMEONE 
TRUSTED BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER 
IS THAT SOMETIMES THOSE PEOPLE 
COULD NOT BE AROUND HAVE WE GONE 
TOO FAR IN WARNING OFF CHILDREN 
FROM TALKING TO STRANGERS AT ALL 
THERE IS FEAR THAT THE STRANGER 
DANGER MESSAGE WE ARE GIVING COULD 
MAKE CHURN TURN DOWN OFFERS OF HELP 
THAT IS WHY WE ARE TRYING TO TALK 
ABOUT STRANGERS WHO ARE SAFER AND 
BUILDINGS TO HEAD TOWARDS THOSE 
MESSAGES ARE USEFUL EVEN AT A 
YOUNG AGE SO IF THE WORST HAPPENS 
IF THEY GET LOST THEY HAVE OPTIONS 
IDEAS THINKING ABOUT SAFER PLACES 
THEY CAN GO THEY ARE NOT 
NECESSARILY TERRIFIED OF EVERY 
SINGLE ADULT 
IS THERE NOT A DANGER IN USING A 
CAMPAIGN IN A WAY IT ENDORSES 
THOSE WHO ARE SAFE THE POLICEMEN 
THE AMBULANCE MEN BUT THE 
IMPLICATION IS THAT IF YOU CAN'T 
SEE THOSE PEOPLE EVERYONE ELSE IS A 
STRANGER DANGER IT PERPETUATES THE 
PROBLEM 
I THINK THERE ARE IT PROBLEM DOES SAY THERE ARE STRANGER TO HELP 
YOU BUT THERE IS A SUGGESTION THAT 
IF YOU ARE LOST GO TO A WOMAN WITH 
CHILDREN SO YOU ARE NOT LIMITING 
IT TO PEOPLE IN UNIFORM 
STEPHEN WE ARE IN A SITUATION IF WE 
ARE ADVISING CHILDREN TO HELP 
PEOPLE IN UNIFORM IF A SINGLE MAN 
SEES A CHILD IN TROUBLE HE MAY BE 
NERVOUS ABOUT APPROACHING AND 
HELPING THE CHILD OUT AS HE IS SEEN 
AS AN UNSAFE STRANGER 
THAT IS 
RIGHT IT IS DIFFICULT MOST PEOPLE 
ARE NOT AXE MURDERERS THEY WILL 
NOT ABDUCT CHILDREN MOST OF US ARE 
SENSIBLE AND NICE CHILDREN HAVE TO 
UNDERSTAND THERE ARE RISKS THERE 
ARE DANGERS THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE 
THEY CAN THINK OF AS SAFER THEY 
CAN HEAD IN THOSE SORTS OF 
DIRECTIONS DIRECTIONS IS THERE THE RELUCTANCE MEN 
GENERALLY WHERE CHILDREN ARE 
PERCEIVED NOT TO TALK TO IS THAT A 
DANGER 
THAT IS THE CASE BUT WE DANGER ALL AS GROWN UPS AND ADULTS 
THINKING OF OURSELVES AS NEEDED IN 
A SITUATION BY CHILDREN BUT THIS 
IS ABOUT KNOWING YOUR COMMUNITY 
GOING OUT WITH YOUR PARENTS 
MEETING PEOPLE KNOWING IN CERTAIN 
SITUATIONS WHAT ARE THE RIGHT 
JUDGMENTS TO MAKE AS A CHILD 
WE ARE ALSO TALKING ABOUT SAFER 
WHRINGS BUILDINGS WHAT IS THE 
ADVICE 
THINGS LIKE DOCTOR'S ADVICE SURGERIES SCHOOLS SUPERMARKETS 
PEOPLE WITH NAME BADGES THOSE WHO 
ARE AUTHORATATIVE AND INSTRUCTIVE 
HAVING THAT LITTLE MESSAGE AS A 
PARENT WORKING WITH CHILDREN IT IS 
HARD TO KNOW YOU CAN OFTEN NEVER 
WIN BUT THIS IS A SIMPLE MESSAGE 
IF IT IS APPARENT WHEN YOU ARE WITH 
YOUR CHILD WHEN YOU ARE TALKING TO 
PEOPLE IN THE SHOPS YOU SAY 
GOODBYE HELLO YOU HELP YOUR CHILD 
IN YOUR COMMUNITY GETTING TO KNOW 
THOSE WHO ARE PEOPLE TO SAFER 
PEOPLE TO TALK TO 
THAT IS POINT THERE ARE SOME 
PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW THEIR 
COMMUNITY COMMUNITY WE ARE OUT OF TIME 
TIME TO TALK WITH MIKE AL WHITE 
HOW ARE YOU 
DID YOU NOTICE THAT SALLY WAS 
TALKING LATIN 
SHE IS LAPSING INTO BORIS JOHNSON 
FASHION IT IS A CLASSIC BROADSHEET 
DIVIDE ALL OF THE BROADSHEETS ARE 
ABOUT BORES BORIS MOST OF IT IN 
ENGLISH AND WHAT IS HAPPENING TO 
GORDON BROWN 
THE FRONT PAGES OF THE MAIL ON 
SUNDAY 
THE FRONT PAGES OF THE MAIL ON SUNDAY 
THERE IS A SUGGESTION ABOUT WHO 
COULD TAKE ON GORDON BROWN COULD 
THAT PERSON BE DAVID MILIBAND THE 
SUNDAY EXPRESS SAYS THAT HE HAS 
BEEN URGED TO CHALLENGE GORDON 
BROWN FOR THE LEADERSHIP 
THE SKP OBSERVER BROWN TO SCRAP 
TAX RISES IN A BID TO CLOSE FURY 
AND DIVING IN WITH MICHAEL THE 
SUNDAY TELEGRAPH HAS A CARTOON OF 
BORIS 
THAT IS THE MOST DRAMATIC BORIS FRONT PAGE AS YOU WOULD EXPECT FOR 
THE CONSERVATIVES NEWS PAPER BORIS 
USED TO WORK FOR THEM 
IT SETS OUT WHAT BORIS IS SUPPOSED 
TO DO IT LOOKS MORE BROADSHEET 
HE IS TO POUR MORE POLICE ON TO THE 
CAPITAL THE CRIME THAT IS HITTING 
THE STREETS WILL BE BETTERED 
PREVENTED PREVENTED AND HE IS GOING TO BETTER THE 
TRANSPORT HE IS TO REVIEW THE 
CONGESTION CHARGE LIKE 
KENSINGTON AND CHELSEA HE MAY SCRAP 
IT PUT MORE POLICE ON THE TUBE SO 
THE IDEA IS TO SUGGESTION DYNAMISM 
THE INDEPENDENT CLAIMS THAT DAVID 
CAMERON IS TERRIFIED OF BORIS HE 
WAS NOT MEANT TO GET ELECTED HE 
WAS MEANT TO GET PUT ON A GOOD 
SHOW SHOW DAVID CAMERON AND BORIS HAVE KNOWN 
EACH OTHER SINCE THEY WERE KIDS 
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THEIR BODY 
LANGUAGE 
THAT IS A BIT DEEP FOR ME LANGUAGE BODY LANGUAGE L. L. TAKE IT THAT DAVID 
CAMERON IS WARY OF BORIS BORIS HAS 
A REPUTATION FOR LETTING PEOPLE 
DOWN DOWN THERE ARE FUNY QUOTES HE HAS 
INTERVIEWED AND HE TALKS ABOUT THE 
ARYAN CONTROVERSY NOTHING TO DO 
WITH HITLER ANDREW MARR WILL BE 
ABLE TO TELL YOU IT IS ABOUT AN 
ANCIENT MEDIEVAL CONTROVERSY YOU 
ARE LOOK SOME TIGER DEPRIVED OF ITS 
MORTAL PRAY THIS IS TYPICAL OF 
BORIS LANGUAGE HE WILL HAVE TO 
REIGN IT IN 
AT WHAT POINT IN HIS CAMPAIGN DID 
YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY 
I THINK THAT 
THE TIPPING QUESTION IS CAN BORIS 
BE SERIOUS HE IS CLEVER EVERYBODY 
KNOWS THAT BUT HE GETS OUT OF 
SCRAPES WITH JOKES HE HAS ALWAYS 
BEEN FUNY BUT IN POLITICS THAT IS 
A MISTAKE COMMONS IS LITTERED WITH 
FUNY MEN REMEMBER TONY BANKS A 
CLEVER GUY BUT A WEAKNESS FOR 
JOKES JOKES YOUR NEWSPAPER SAID NOT TO VOTE FOR 
BORIS 
YES BUT QUICKLY WE HAVE A BORIS STORY HERE ABOUT DAVID MILIBAND 
URGED TO DEPOSE BROWN AND THE NEXT 
MOVE WILL THERE BE A STALKING 
HORSE AS YOU CAN SEE THE EXPRESS 
HAS SUGGESTIONED THAT DAVID 
MILIBAND IS URGED TO STAND 
REMEMBER JOHN MCDONALD HE SAYS HE 
KNOWS HE CANNOT WIN BUT HE CAN BE 
THE STALKING HORSE TO DESTABILISE 
GORDON AND LET THE GROWN UPS IN L. 
AM NOT CONVINCED BY THE ARGUMENT I 
WOULD BE SURPRISE FUNDAMENTAL IT 
HAPPENS BUT THAT IS AROUND 
MANY QUESTIONS FOR GORDON TO ANSWER 
THIS MORNING 
THE MAN TO ANSWER THEM HERE IS 
ANDREW MAR GOOD MORNING 
I HAVE LIAM FOX AND GORDON BROWN 
THERE IS A PHRASE IN THESE 
CIRCUMSTANCES THE JOB OF POLITICAL 
JOURNALISTS IS TO COME DOWN FROM 
THE HILLS AFTER THE BATTLE IS OVER 
AND BARE NET TO THE SURVIVORS THAT 
IS WHAT IS GOING ON TODAY THERE 
ARE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS FOR 
GORDON BROWN WHETHER HE CAN CHANGE 
POLICY THE BUSINESS OF STALKING 
HORSES THAT MICHAEL WAS DISCUSSING 
NOW IT IS INTERESTING I THINK TO 
SEE THE DEMEANOUR OF A POLITICIAN 
UNDER THIS PRESSURE CAN THEY 
CONDUCT THEMSELVES WITH GRACE CAN 
THEY SAY SOMETHING KNEW GORDON 
BROWN HAS HAD A SERIOUS OF THINGS 
HE IS TALKING ABOUT THE LONG TERM

THE SPORT BACK TO YOU BOTH THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH 
BEING GOOD FATHER TAKE AS LOFT 
COMMITMENT AND HARD WORK DOESN'T 
IT CHARLIE 
TSK DOES 
LET YOU READ 
THIS AS YOU ARE A FANTASTIC DAD 
THAT IS THE KINDEST THING YOU HAVE 
EVER SAID 
IT IS A JOB MADE NEXT TO 
IMPOSSIBLE THANKS TO CELEBRITY 
FATHERS PEOPLE LIKE DAVID BECKHAM 
WHO MAKE IT LOOK EASY A SUGGESTION 
OF A NEW SURVEY WE WILL DISCUSS 
MODERN DADHOOD WE HAVE ASKED 
ORDINARY FATHERS IF THE BECKHAM 
EFFECT HAS MADE THEM FEEL 
INADEQUATE AS PRESSURE 
UNDER PRESSURE 
I DON'T THINK IS ABOUT MEASURING 
ABOUT BECKHAM THERE ARE COMPETING 
PRESSURES THAT YOU HAVE ALL THE 
TIME IT PUTS STRESS ON YOUR 
RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE SOMETIMES WORK 
DEMANDS YOU SPEND LOFT YOUR TIME 
AT WORK 
WELL OBVIOUSLY GOT A 
CHILD WITHIN YOURSELF MAYBE NOT TO 
BE THE PERFECT DAD NO ONE IS THE 
PERFECT DAD JUST TRY AND DO YOUR 
BEST AND MAKE SURE THAT YOUR 
CHILDREN ARE PROUD OF YOU REALLY 
YOU STEP IN THE DOOR AND YOU DO 
THIS CAN YOU DO THAT CAN YOU DO 
THE OTHER THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY 
TO SIT DOWN AND RELAX AND WATCH THE 
TELLY FOR TWENTY MINUTES OR HALF AN 
HOUR STRAIGHT INTO FAMILIARY 
ROUTINE 
I LIKE GETTING INVOLVED ROUTINE WITH LITTLE ONES L. HAVE AN OLDER 
SON FROM A DIFFERENT MARRIAGE NOT 
THAT MUCH EXTRA IT'S NICE BEING A 
HANDS ON DAD L. FIND 
IF YOU 
HAVEN'T GOT THE MEANS TO DO 
WHATEVER THE BECKHAMS DO OR OTHER 
PEOPLE DO CAN YOU ONLY DO THE BEST 
WHAT YOU HAVE FOR YOUR KIDS L. 
DON'T FEEL UNDER PRESSURE NO 
UNDER PRESSURE 
WITH US NOW DAMION QUEVA AND CAROL 
MUSKORON MUSKORON CAN I START WITH YOU DAMION YOU 
ARE DAD YOURSELF DO YOU BUY INTO 
THIS IDEA THAT MEN FEEL UNDER 
PRESSURE AS FATHERS 
MOST CERTAINLY 
BUY INTO IT THAT THEY FEEL UNDER 
PRESSURE BEING A PARENT IS ONE OF 
THE MOST DIFFICULT JOBS IN THE 
WORLD THIS HAS CHANGED OVER THE 
LAST TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS OUR PARTNERS 
DON'T EXPECT US TO BE HOW WE WERE 
TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS AGO WE ARE EXPECTED 
TO JOIN IN AND PARTICIPATE AS MUCH 
AS POSSIBLE WE WANT TO TAKE FIFTY PER CENT OF 
THE BUSHEDEN THAT IS READJUSTMENT 
WE HAVE BEEN DADS FOR A LONG TIME 
THERE IS A SERIOUS READJUSTMENT TO 
HOW WE GO ABOUT OUR DAILY LIVES 
WITH OUR CHILDREN AND PARTNERS DO DO YOU MEASURE YOUR HUSBAND UP AGAINST 
A ROLE MODEL LIKE DAVID BECKHAM AND 
FIND HIM LACKING OR BETTER 
HE IS 
TERRIBLE AT FOOTBALL ON A SERIOUS 
NOTE I THINK THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND 
WHY MEN FEEL WHY DADS FEEL UNDER 
PRESSURE I THINK WELCOME TO 
PARENTHOOD DADS ARE GETTING MORE 
INVOLVED THEY ARE BEGINNING TO 
UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT EASY L. 
THINK THE SURVEY COMPLAINED ABOUT 
MEN WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE LACK 
OF ME TIME YOU KNOW THAT'S THE 
WAY IT IS WOMEN HAVE BEEN JUGGLING 
THIS FOR FIFTY TO SIXTY YEARS STHINS HAVE 
BEEN GOING OUT MORE INTO THE WORK 
MARKET IT IS NOT EASY 
YOU ARE 
SAYING IF DADS WANT TO BE NEW DADS 
THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT THERE IS DOWN 
FEELINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT A 
BIT OF NOT DEPRESSION SO MUCH BUT 
FEELING UNDER PRESSURE IS A FEATURE 
OF PARENTHOOD 
SOME ARE EVEN SAYING 
DEPRESSION ACCORD TOGETHER SURVEY
