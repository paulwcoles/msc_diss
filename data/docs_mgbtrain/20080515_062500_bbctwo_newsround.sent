HELLO THERE WELCOME TO NEWSROUND 
FIRST UP RANGERS' DREAM OF WINNING 
FOUR TROPHIES IS OVER THEY WERE 
BEATEN IN THE UEFA CUP FINAL BY 
RUSSIAN SIDE ZENIT SAINT PETERSBURG 
AND MANCHESTER THERE WAS TROUBLE 
ON THE STREETS FANS CLASHED WITH 
POLICE WHEN A BIG SCREEN SET UP IN 
THE CITY CENTRE STOPPED WORKING 
AROUND THIRTY PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED 
IN CHINA TEN MILLION PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN AFFECTED BY THE EARTHQUAKE 
WHICH HIT SICHUAN PROVINCE ON 
MONDAY FLATTENING ENTIRE VILLAGES 
THIRTY THOUSAND TROOPS HAVE BEEN SENT TO 
HELP THAT THE RESCUE OPERATION 
BRINGING FOOD AND WATER AND 
SEARCHING FOR SURVIVORS NEARLY 
FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE KNOWN TO HAVE 
BEEN KILLED AND ANOTHER TWENTY SIX THOUSAND ARE 
STILL TRAPPED IN RUBBLE 
YOU PROBABLY NORMALLY TRY TO AVOID 
THEM IF YOU CAN BUT HAVE YOU 
THOUGHT OF BEING NICE TO NETTLES 
IT IS ACTUALLY BE NICE TO A NETTLE 
WEEK NOW SO ARE THE STINGERS ALL 
BAD LIZO HAS GOT MORE 
NETTLES ARE NOT THE NICEST OF 
PLANTS THEY DO NOT LOOK THAT 
PRETTY AND THEY HAVE GOT A NASTY 
STING LOADS OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY 
GOT TOO CLOSE TO THEM AT SOME POINT 
IN TIME 
ONE DAY I WAS CYCLING IN 
THE SUMMER AND I FELL INTO A BIG 
PATCH OF NETTLES AND I WAS REALLY 
ANGRY AT MYSELF FOR LOSING BALANCE 
IT WAS REALLY PAINFUL AND LOOKED 
DISGUSTING 
WHEN YOU GET STUNG IT DISGUSTING MAKES YOU WANT TO IT SHALLOT MY MY FRIENDS HAVE COME OUT WITH RASHERS 
MARX READ BITS ON THEIR ARMS IT 
HAS NOT BEEN VERY NICE 
BUT OUR 
NETTLES THAT BAD DO THEY HAVE A 
SOFTER SIDE THIS IS A MAN WHO 
KNOWS WHY DO NETTLE STING THEY THEY HAVE SMALL NEEDLE LIKE HAIRS ON THE 
NETTLES WHICH RUB ON YOUR SKIN 
THEY HAVE A CHEMICAL WHICH 
IRRITATES YOUR SKIN 
WHAT SHOULD 
YOU DO IF YOU GET STUNG SOME SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THERE IS A PLANT 
WHICH GROWS AROUND THE NETTLES 
WHICH HAS LARGE LEAVES IF YOU RUB 
THOSE LEAVES ON THE STING IT 
SHOULD MAKE THIS THING HER CLASS 
IN ACTUAL FACT THERE IS NO 
EVIDENCE THAT REALLY WORKS MAY BE 
LOOKING FOR BELIEF TAKES YOUR MIND 
OFF IT 
SOME PEOPLE WANT US TO BE 
NICER TO NATAL'S BECAUSE THEY DO 
MORE THAN STAY THEY CAN MAKE TEA 
AND SOUP AND MEDICINE THEY ARE 
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR SOME WILDLIFE
