I TOOK OFF MY CLOTHES IN PUBLIC 
I'M LITERALLY TERRIFIED IT'S NOT FUNNY 
I HOPE TO PERSUADE HUNDREDS OF OTHER WOMEN TO DO THE SAME 
DON'T BE SHY 
THE REASON FOR GETTING NAKED HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH SEX 
IT HAD MORE TO DO WITH HOW YOU LOOK 
I'M GOING TO BASICALLY START OFF AS I AM NOW 
AND THEN SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO TO ME TO MAKE ME REALLY BEAUTIFUL 
AND HOW OUR IDEA OF PERFECTION HAS BEEN PERVERTED TO FIT THE DEMANDS OF THE BEAUTY INDUSTRY 
WE'RE ASPIRING TO BE SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST 
THE ONLY QUESTION WAS WOULD BRITAIN JOIN ME IN MY QUEST OR WOULD I BE LEFT OUT IN THE COLD 
YOU KNOW ASKING PEOPLE TO COME AND GET NAKED TODAY IS A BIG ASK 
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE'S GOING TO TURN UP 
MY NAME'S DAWN PORTER I'M TWENTY EIGHT AND EVERY YEAR I SEEM TO PUT MYSELF 
THROUGH THE SAME HELLISH RITUALS TO GET THE PERFECT BEACH BODY 
IT STARTS WITH THE SEARCH FOR THAT ELUSIVE BIKINI 
YOU KNOW THE ONE THAT MAKES YOU LOOK FABULOUS 
HERE YOU GO GIVE US A SHOUT IF YOU NEED ANY MORE HELP O. K. THANK YOU 
OH I WAS HAVING A SKINNY DAY UNTIL NOW 
IT'S NOT THAT I HATE MY BODY IT'S NOT THAT I FIND IT REPULSIVE 
TO LOOK AT OR ANYTHING IT'S JUST REALLY HARD TO KIND OF LOOK AT YOURSELF AND SAY 
OH THAT LOOKS NICE IN A BIKINI 
YOU KNOW YOU CAN DRESS IT WELL BUT YOU'RE PRACTICALLY NAKED 
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE WALKING AROUND IN FRONT OF PEOPLE 
PRACTICALLY NAKED AND ALL YOU SEE IN THERE IS YOUR WOBBLY BITS 
AND IS IT ANY WONDER 
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE 
THIS IS THE IMAGE THAT WE'RE TOLD IS PERFECT 
IT ACTUALLY SAYS PERFECTLY FIT ON IT 
SO WHAT HAPPENS I LOOK AT THAT I PICK THE BIKINI UP I GO OFF WITH THE BIKINI I PUT IT ON AND I LOOK 
SO FAR AWAY FROM THAT I FEEL COMPLETELY DEPRESSED AFTERWARDS 
YOU KNOW SHE LOOKS AMAZING BUT 
I KNOW THAT THERE'S JUST NO WAY THAT I'D EVER LOOK LIKE THAT 
AND WHEN WE FEEL DEFLATED ABOUT HOW BAD WE LOOK 
THERE'S ALWAYS A MIRACLE CURE ON HAND TO HELP US GET RID OF THE BITS WE HATE 
IT'S A NICE THOUGHT ISN'T IT 
FOUR BOTTLES OF NICE SMELLING CREAM 
AND ALL YOUR WEIGHT AND IMAGE PROBLEMS WILL BE OVER 
I'LL BUY INTO THAT 
I MEAN IT WORKED ON HER DIDN'T IT 
AND MILLIONS OF US DO BUY INTO IT 
IN THE U. K. THE HEALTH AND BEAUTY INDUSTRY IS WORTH A STAGGERING SEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION A YEAR 
AND THE AVERAGE WOMAN SPENDS TWO THOUSAND ON BEAUTY TREATMENTS AND COSMETICS 
BUT IT'S A SMALL AMOUNT TO PAY IF IT'S GOING TO MAKE US ALL PERFECT 
AND WHEN IT COMES TO GOING ALL ON THE BEACH FOR ME THIRTY QUID ON A FAKE TAN IS WORTH EVERY PENNY 
IN A WEEK FOR MOST LADIES NOW I THINK IT'S AN HOUR IN THE SALON 
HAVING THE NAILS DONE AND IT'S HALF AN HOUR HAVING THE TOENAILS DONE 
HALF AN HOUR HAVING THE SPRAY TAN 
IT'S AMAZING HOW WE ACTUALLY IT'S WORTH IT THOUGH ISN'T IT 
GET TIME TO DO ANYTHING WITH ALL THE TIME IN THE SALON 
BUT IT IS WORTH IT THOUGH COS WHEN YOU DO GET TO THE MOMENT 
I'M STANDING HERE TOTALLY EXFOLIATED AND PROBABLY AT MY WORST COS I HAVEN'T GOT A TAN 
YOU THINK WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE TAN ALL THESE THINGS DONE 
IT'S A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE TAKING YOUR CLOTHES OFF 
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS BEING NATURALLY BEAUTIFUL ANY MORE IS THERE ISN'T THERE 
IT'S THE FAKE TAN THE HIGHLIGHTS NOT FOR YOU BUT FOR A LOT OF US 
O. K. YOU TURN ROUND AND I'M GOING TO START SPRAYING YOU 
WHILE A FAKE TAN HIDES A MULTITUDE OF SINS THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT NEED A BIT MORE WORK 
WE SPEND ALL THIS TIME AND ALL THIS MONEY TRYING TO LOOK GOOD BUT TO WHAT ENDS 
HOW MANY OF US CAN REALLY SAY WE FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT OUR BODIES 
THE PROBLEM IS WHILE WE'RE FOREVER COMPARING OURSELVES TO IMAGES OF PERFECTION 
WE NEVER GET TO SEE WHAT REAL WOMEN LOOK LIKE WITHOUT THEIR CLOTHES ON 
EXCEPT PERHAPS IN THE WOMEN'S CHANGING ROOM 
EXCUSE ME WOULD YOU MIND IF I COME AND CHAT WITH YOU WHILE YOU'RE NAKED 
OOH NO THANK YOU WHY 
I DON'T THINK I'D FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE ABOUT THAT 
DO YOU LIKE GETTING CHANGED IN COMMUNAL CHANGING ROOMS 
NOT REALLY I'D RATHER GET CHANGED IN A PRIVATE CHANGING ROOM I'M ALL RIGHT ABOUT IT YOU ARE 
I'M VERY QUICK OH RIGHT DO YOU FEEL SELF CONSCIOUS ER AT THIS MOMENT YES 
I DON'T LIKE BEING VERY EXPOSED 
I DON'T LIKE SHOWING IT OFF I'M JUST NOT THAT KIND OF PERSON 
YEAH I THINK WOMEN ARE REALLY CRITICAL 
THEY DO LOOK AT OTHER WOMEN AROUND THEM AND SIZE EACH OTHER UP 
BASICALLY THE TRICK IS NOT TO LOOK AT ANYONE ELSE MAKE SURE THAT 
NO ONE ELSE IS LOOKING AT YOU AND TRY AND GET OUT OF THERE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN 
FOR LOADS OF WOMEN THE QUEST FOR THE PERFECT BODY IS LEADING THEM TO TAKE MORE EXTREME MEASURES 
NOW WITHOUT TAKING YOUR BRA OFF IF YOU LOOK FROM HERE TO HERE WHAT BOTHERS YOU 
THIS O. K. 
THE FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION COSMETIC SURGERY INDUSTRY HAS DOUBLED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS 
AND RECENTLY A SURVEY OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WOMEN SUGGESTED THAT MORE THAN HALF 
WOULD BE PREPARED TO GO UNDER THE KNIFE 
THE THING I CAN SEE IN YOUR BREASTS AND THEY'RE A GOOD PAIR OF BREASTS YAY 
THE NIPPLES ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE 
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE UPPER PART OF YOUR BREASTS ARE A BIT EMPTY OH 
COMPARED TO THE LOWER HALF RIGHT 
SO WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A BRA ON AND YOU HAVE A T. SHIRT ON THEY LOOK MORE FULLER AND A BIT HIGHER 
THAT'S WHAT I WANT NO SPANIEL'S EARS 
O. K. O. K. MY BUM I ALMOST FEEL A BIT UM STRAIGHT DOWN 
UH HUH APPARENTLY MY RIGHT ONE'S SMALLER THAN MY LEFT 
THAT'S QUITE NORMAL IS IT YEAH 
THERE ARE EVEN SLIGHT DIFFERENCES IN THE BREASTS O. K. THIS IS QUITE NORMAL 
MY PILATES TEACHER SAID THAT AND I'M QUITE UPSET I'LL HAVE A LOOK IF YOU DON'T MIND 
IT IS A RATHER FLATTER BUTTOCK 
YEAH I TEND TO AGREE WITH THAT 
UM YOU CAN HAVE A BUTTOCK IMPLANT 
DOES IT FEEL LIKE YOU'RE SITTING ON A WHOOPEE CUSHION 
NO BUT THE IMPLANT IS NOT PUT HERE SO YOU DON'T SIT ON IT 
O. K. IT'S PUT SOMEWHERE HERE TO GIVE YOU THAT CURVE 
SURE SO HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST FOR ME TO HAVE BUM IMPLANTS 
ON AVERAGE THE BUTTOCK IMPLANT COST IS ON AN AVERAGE SIX TO SEVEN THOUSAND 
THE IMPLANTS COST A LOT OF MONEY SO THEY'RE PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE OPERATIONS 
BREAST IMPLANT AN AVERAGE IS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND 
RIGHT 
THE TUMMY WE TALKED ABOUT IS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND 
FOURTEEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND IS THE RIGHT INDICATION O. K. 
FIFTEEN THOUSAND WAS WELL OUT OF MY LEAGUE BUT IF I COULDN'T HAVE IT MYSELF 
I STILL WANTED TO SEE WHAT THE PERFECT BODY LOOKED LIKE 
SO I DID A SEARCH ON THE INTERNET TO SEE WHAT I COULD FIND 
OH LOOK 
ROSA 
ROSA'S GOT THE PERFECT BODY 
SHE'S TALL SHE'S BLONDE SHE'S BEAUTIFUL 
SHE HAS AMAZING CRYSTAL BLUE EYES THAT ARE TOTALLY MESMERISING 
HER FACE IS DELICATELY HAND PAINTED AND HER ROSE PINK LIPS AND THOSE GORGEOUS EYES SHE'S STUNNING 
ROSA COMES PROTECTED BY BUBBLE WRAP 
SHE'S PERFECT 
I DO BELIEVE I HAVE FOUND THE PERFECT BODY 
AND SHE WASN'T GOING TO COST ME AN ARM AND A LEG 
ROSA ARRIVED 
LOOK ELY ROSA'S HERE AUNTIE ROSA 
I THINK I'D LOOK GOOD AS 
WHERE'S YOUR BUM 
I KIND OF FEEL THIS WEIRD SENSITIVITY TOWARDS HER 
SHE'S NOT JUST A PIECE OF PLASTIC YOU KNOW 
NOW THIS DOES FEEL A BIT SEXUAL 
THERE SHE WAS PERFECTION 
FIVE F. T. NINE SIZE EIGHT BEAUTIFULLY TONED BUT 
THAT'S NOT REAL 
THAT'S REAL 
BUT IT WOULD HAVE TO DO 
SPENDING THE WEEKEND AT THE SEASIDE IT WAS TIME FOR ME TO GRIN AND BEAR IT 
HOWEVER THERE ARE A GROUP OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DON'T SEEM TO SUFFER FROM THE SAME INHIBITIONS 
THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING ISN'T IT I MEAN YOU THINK ABOUT 
HOW MUCH PREPARATION I'VE PUT INTO JUST WEARING MY SWIMSUIT TODAY 
TO BE ABLE TO JUST GO ALL OUT LET YOUR WOBBLY BITS JUST HANG 
THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT MINDSET ISN'T IT 
I JUST CAN'T BE THAT FREE OF INHIBITION 
I SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS SWIMMING COSTUME COS IT'S GOT 
THIS SPECIAL MATERIAL IN IT THAT SUCKS YOUR TUMMY IN A BIT 
I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS IT'S AN OUTFIT THAT I PREPARED FOR THIS MOMENT 
AND TO NOT WEAR IT WOULD CAUSE A TSUNAMI 
THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING THAT THEY'RE DOING IN THERE 
THEY'RE NOT BOTHERED ABOUT COVERING UP THEIR WOBBLY BITS 
LIKE I AM OR YOU KNOW MAKING BAD BITS LOOK BETTER 
AND SO I'VE SPENT ALL THIS MONEY AND SO MANY HOURS AND HOURS OF MY TIME 
TRYING TO CREATE MY BODY TO LOOK PERFECT 
GET TO THIS STATE OF IDEAL THAT I THINK EXISTS WHEN REALLY IT'S BECAUSE 
IF IT'S NOT THERE THEN IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN IS IT 
INTRIGUED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T WALK AROUND WITH THESE INSECURITIES 
I MANAGED TO PERSUADE A GROUP OF NATURISTS TO LET ME ER HANG OUT WITH THEM FOR THE DAY 
I DON'T MEAN TO JUDGE BUT I CAN'T GET OUT OF MY HEAD THAT THIS IS ALL A BIT WEIRD 
DON'T GET ME WRONG I LOVE MEN'S WILLIES BUT THERE'S A TIME AND A PLACE 
IT'S SO PRETTY AND IDYLLIC AND THEN SUDDENLY 
A BIG SWINGING PAIR OF BOLLOCKS COMES BY AND YOU JUST THINK ARGH 
I'D GET REALLY EMBARRASSED LOOKING AT ALL THE BOYS' WILLIES DON'T LOOKING AT BOYS' WILLIES GET YOU 
WELL NO YOU SORT OF LOOK INTO THEIR EYES YOU DON'T SORT OF OH O. K. 
OH THAT'S WHAT YOU DO SEE I'M WALKING AROUND LIKE THIS AND MY EYES ARE AT CROTCH LEVEL ALL THE TIME 
HI 
HELLO DEAR IS IT QUITE LIBERATING 
YES IT REALLY IS ENJOYABLE WERE YOU NERVOUS AT FIRST 
NO NOT REALLY REALLY NO YOU JUST GOT IT ALL OUT YEAH 
DOES IT NOT EVER GET A LITTLE BIT SEXY 
WELL YES SOMETIMES DOES IT 
COS I KEEP WALKING AROUND AND I CAN'T STOP LOOKING AT PEOPLE'S WILLIES 
I'M GOING TO WATCH YOUR BOTTOM AS YOU WALK AWAY DAVE 
PHWOAR CHECK HIM OUT OOH WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT 
PUT IT THIS WAY YOU'VE EITHER GOT TO BE A MAN OR A WOMAN 
YEAH SO YOU'VE EITHER GOT TO HAVE ONE OR THE OTHER YEAH SO WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT 
NOTHING WRONG WITH MINE NO WELL THEN 
DOESN'T MEAN I WANT EVERYONE TO SEE IT THOUGH 
I DON'T THINK THAT I COULD TAKE MY CLOTHES OFF HERE TODAY 
AFTER THE FIRST TWO MINUTES YOU'LL FEEL JUST AS IF YOU'RE DRESSED NO I WON'T YEAH AND YOUR MATE 
YEAH YOU WOULD YOU WOULD 
NO IT TOOK ME AGES TO DECIDE WHAT TO WEAR TODAY I'M NOT TAKING IT OFF 
DON'T BE SHY 
THESE PEOPLE HERE ARE IN A REAL MINORITY WITH THE WAY THAT THEY GET NAKED 
IT'S ALMOST AS IF THEY'RE TOTALLY VOID OF INHIBITION 
AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY DEALT WITH THAT AGES AGO AND NOW THEY'RE JUST OUT THERE 
I CAN'T COME HERE TODAY AND JUST FORGET OR CHANGE THE WAY THAT I FEEL 
SO I COULD SEE IN THE FUTURE THAT MAYBE I COULD BE LIKE THAT 
BUT AT THE MOMENT I'M NOT THERE YET 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE LIKE THAT I'D LIKE TO HAVE THAT CONFIDENCE 
BUT I DON'T WANT TO SIT AROUND HAVING A BARBECUE WITH SOME GUY'S WINKLE IN MY FACE 
UNLESS HE'S REALLY FIT 
YOU SEE FOR ME GETTING NAKED SHOULD BE AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT SEXY 
WITH THE ART OF BURLESQUE BECOMING MORE AND MORE POPULAR WHAT BETTER WAY TO TRY AND SHED MY INHIBITIONS 
THAN WITH ONE OF LONDON'S TOP BURLESQUE TEACHERS JO KING 
WHO WASN'T QUITE WHAT I WAS EXPECTING 
YOU SEE I DON'T WANT TO OFFEND YOU BY THIS AT ALL DON'T OFFEND ME 
BUT COS IT INVOLVES STRIPPING I WAS EXPECTING KIND OF A. 
I CONSIDER A STRIPPER TO BE SOME SKINNY LITTLE TONED LITTLE KIND OF 
YOU MEAN SOMEONE WITHOUT THIS KIND OF BODY NO IT'S GREAT WITH FAT BITS 
AND CELLULITE IT'S GREAT 
YOU'RE A WOMAN I AM AREN'T I 
JUST FAB BUT IT TOOK ME A BIT BY SURPRISE COS I JUST HAD IN MY HEAD 
LAP DANCING LADIES AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING NO NO NO 
THIS ISN'T ABOUT LAP DANCING O. K. 
THE WONDERFUL THING ABOUT BURLESQUE IT'S ABOUT REJOICING IN THE FEMALE FORM WHATEVER THAT IS RIGHT 
THAT COULD MEAN THAT YOU HAVE NO BREASTS 
PERHAPS YOU'VE HAD A MASTECTOMY AND HAD THEM BOTH REMOVED 
IT DOESN'T STOP YOU BEING FEMALE AND DOESN'T STOP YOU REJOICING IN THE FACT THAT YOU ARE STILL FEMALE 
SO I DEAL WITH AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DO IT FOR ALL DIFFERENT REASONS ALL DIFFERENT ISSUES 
BURLESQUE IN ITSELF IF YOU JUST WANT TO LEARN IT 
IS REALLY JUST ABOUT YOU GETTING IN TOUCH WITH A BIT OF GLAM 
O. K. A BIT OF FUN REAL FEMININITY 
A BIT OF COMEDY VERY TONGUE IN CHEEK AND ENJOYING WHAT YOU'VE GOT AND JUST REJOICING IN THE FACT 
YOU KNOW THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS YOU'RE INCREDIBLY LUCKY 
O. K. YEAH O. K. BECAUSE I TEACH PEOPLE 
SO THE FIRST RULE IN MY CLASSROOM IS AND THIS IS THE ONLY BIT WHERE I'M REALLY HARSH O. K. NO NEGATIVITY 
FINE I DON'T ALLOW NEGATIVITY IN MY CLASSROOM ALL RIGHT 
O. K. BECAUSE I DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO REALLY HAVE REASON TO COMPLAIN AND THEY DON'T 
SO YOU LEAVE THE NEGATIVITY AT THE DOOR AND WHEN YOU GO BACK OUT OF THE DOOR GUESS WHAT 
YOU DON'T PICK IT BACK UP CAN I GO AND TAKE IT OUT 
GO AND TAKE IT OUT TAKE YOUR NEGATIVITY OUT LEAVE IT OUT THERE SPLURGE IT 
IT'S GONE HOORAY 
THE FIRST THING I LEARNT ABOUT TAKING MY CLOTHES OFF WAS THAT I NEEDED TO DRESS FOR THE OCCASION 
AND JO CAME PREPARED WITH ALL THE ACCESSORIES 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT PASTIES ARE 
DO THEY GO ON MY NIPPLES THEY GO ON YOUR NIPPLES 
THESE ONES THESE ARE ACTUALLY PASTIES WITH TASSELS 
EVERYONE GETS THEM CONFUSED NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS 
IT'S JUST I'M HERE 
AND IT WOULD BE A KIND OF CUE FOR YOU IF YOU WANT TO DO IT 
SO THAT JUST GOES LITERALLY OVER MY NIPPLE 
OVER YOUR NIPPLE A BIT LIKE MINE HAS GONE OVER 
YOU KEPT THAT ALL WELL HIDDEN 
DID YOU THINK I REALLY HAVE POINTY BREASTS 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON 
SO 
DIP INTO IT LEAN FORWARD LET YOUR BOOBY GO IN 
KIND OF LET IT YEAH 
KIND OF LEAN FORWARD AND KIND OF SQUIDGE IT IN A BIT AND WE'LL SEE 
I FELT REALLY BRILLIANT UP TO NOW COS I FELT REALLY SEXY 
AND POWERFUL AND NOW I'VE GOT TO TAKE MY CLOTHES OFF AND SUDDENLY MY CONFIDENCE HAS JUST DROPPED 
I KNOW EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO THEIR OWN OPINION AND THERE ARE REASONS 
WHY EVERYBODY GOES THROUGH IT BUT WE MAKE SUCH A HUGE DEAL OUT OF IT 
WHY ARE SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS PLANNING TO HAVE BREAST AUGMENTATION FOR CHRIST'S SAKE 
IT'S NOT ON WE HAVE TO 
I'VE GOT A THREE YEAR OLD I WANT TO TEACH MY DAUGHTER TO UNDERSTAND THAT HOWEVER SHE LOOKS IS FANTASTIC 
MAKE THE MOST OF WHAT YOU'VE GOT I'M NOT SAYING DON'T 
BUT LEARN TO LOVE IT COS YOU'RE STUCK WITH IT 
DESPITE JO'S BEST EFFORTS IT WAS HARDER THAN IT LOOKED 
I MANAGED TO GET MY BRA OFF BUT PASTIES OR NO PASTIES 
THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO BARE MY BOOBS TO THE WORLD 
HELLO LOOK YES THEY'RE JUST BOOBIES 
THEY'RE JUST BOOBIES SHALL WE DO IT 
GO ON DARE YOU DARE YOU 
OH DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'D DO THAT 
YEAH BUT YOU CAN'T O. K. 
IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK LOOKS A BIT 
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 
THAT'S THE SEXIEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN 
HELLO LOVE HOW ARE YOU 
YEAH WELL YOU COULD DO A COMEDY BURLESQUE ACTUALLY 
JUST GO UP AND DO OOH HELLO 
SHALL WE TURN THEM AWAY AND DO IT 
TURN THE CAMERA AWAY THEN SEE IF YOU FEEL BRAVE ENOUGH I'M NOT DOING THIS ON CAMERA I'M NOT 
SHE MIGHT WE'RE GONNA DO IT WITHOUT CAMERA FIRST 
TURN THE CAMERA AWAY LET ME DO THIS WE'LL SEE MAYBE GO AWAY GO AWAY 
I'D HAD SO MUCH FUN SO JO SET ME THE CHALLENGE 
OF PERFORMING IN PUBLIC AT ONE OF HER POPULAR BURLESQUE NIGHTS 
BUT FIRST I HAD TO FIND MY OUTFIT 
I FEARED I WAS ABOUT TO TAKE MY CLOTHES OFF IN FRONT OF A BUNCH OF 
DIRTY OLD MEN BUT NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH 
WITH AN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FEMALE AUDIENCE 
BURLESQUE OFFERS WOMEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO CELEBRATE THE FEMALE FORM 
IN SHAPES AND SIZES 
WHEN SHE SAYS WALK AND YOU'VE GOT TO SHIMMY 
BEFORE THE PERFORMANCE THE OTHER DANCERS DID THEIR BEST TO HELP ME RELAX AND EVEN OFFERED A FEW TIPS 
HOW LONG CAN YOU STAND STILL WITH YOUR BOOBS OUT BEFORE PEOPLE START BOOING 
YOU DON'T YOU DON'T STAND ABOUT A DAY AND A HALF 
FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT JIGGLE AND GIGGLE IT'LL BE FINE 
YOU WON'T BE THERE FOR HALF AN HOUR 
O. K. JUST GO ENJOY YOURSELF 
SMILE AND CONNECT AND THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER 
EVEN IF YOU FORGET TO TAKE THINGS OFF JUST SHIMMY YOUR BUM 
O. K. FINE WIGGLE YOUR ARSE SHAKE YOUR TITS 
SMILE O. K. YOU WILL BE FINE 
YOU WERE SO FANTASTIC IN THE CLASSROOM I'M REALLY NOT WORRIED 
O. K. REALLY REALLY NOT WORRIED YOU'RE GONNA BE FAB 
I MEAN WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING 
I MEAN MY DAD WOULD BE EVER SO PROUD IF HE COULD SEE ME NOW 
O. K. WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOMEBODY UP HERE NOW 
AND SHE CAME ALONG AND SHE'S HAD ONE TWO HOUR SESSION 
NOW IF YOU'RE NOT LOVELY I'M GONNA FIND OUT WHERE YOU ALL LIVE 
SO I WANT CHEERING AND SHOUTING AND WHOOPING AND LOTS OF NOISE 
BECAUSE I WANT TO GET HER OUT HERE QUICKLY BEFORE SHE WETS HERSELF 
HANDS TOGETHER FOR THE LOVELY DAWN PORTER 
WHEN I TOOK TO THE STAGE I FELT TOTALLY EXPOSED 
THEN I THINK THE ADRENALIN MUST HAVE KICKED IN BECAUSE I ACTUALLY STARTED TO ENJOY MYSELF 
ALL WAS GOING QUITE WELL UNTIL MY SODDING HEELS LET ME DOWN 
BY WHICH POINT ONE THOUGHT OH WHAT THE HELL 
SHE WAS JUST SO GOOD TO JUST KEEP GOING YOU DID REALLY WELL THAT WAS FANTASTIC 
I WAS LIKE WHAT'S SHE GONNA DO AH SHE KEPT GOING YEAH 
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA BREAK MY ANKLE 
YOU WERE FANTASTIC OH GOD I'M SHAKING SO MUCH 
OH MY GOD I'M LITERALLY SHAKING 
IT'S JUST LIKE A THREE MINUTE THING BUT YOU'RE JUST LIKE 
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC THOUGH WELL DONE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE WELCOME I DID ENJOY IT 
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY MY STOMACH MY BODY HAS DECIDED TO GIVE ME PAIN TO CELEBRATE MY ACHIEVEMENTS 
I'VE ACTUALLY GOT STOMACH ACHE 
WHOO AND YOU KEPT SMILING THROUGH IT 
AND IT REALLY WAS AN ACHIEVEMENT 
BUT IF I'M HONEST I DID FEEL I'D BEEN ABLE TO HIDE BEHIND A PERFORMANCE 
IF I WAS TO GET TO GRIPS WITH MY TRUE NAKED SELF 
I HAD TO BE PREPARED TO GO ONE STEP FURTHER 
I THINK I'LL HAVE A NICE TRIANGLE PLEASE O. K. WE'LL GO FOR A TRIANGLE THEN 
A NICE GIRLIE TRIANGLE A NICE GIRLIE TRIANGLE O. K. THANK YOU NO PROBLEM 
YOU GET TO SEE CLOSE UP GIRLS' FANNIES ALL THE TIME SO YOU MUST KNOW IF YOU'RE NORMAL 
WITH ME AS ANOTHER GIRL I DON'T KNOW IF I'M NORMAL OR NOT 
OF COURSE EVERYONE'S NORMAL EVERYBODY'S DIFFERENT 
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ONE THAT YOU THINK WOW THAT'S A REALLY GOOD ONE I WISH I HAD THAT ONE 
H. M. M. YES REALLY YES I MEAN 
THERE'S ALWAYS IMPROVEMENTS THAT YOU COULD DO AS WELL ISN'T THERE YES 
SO YES OF COURSE YOU COULD ALWAYS IMPROVE IT 
I FIND IT QUITE INTRIGUING THOUGH IT'S SUCH A FAUX PAS TO KIND OF SEE ONE 
THEY'RE NOT PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE ARE THEY THEY'RE NOT THOUGH ARE THEY 
BUT GENITALS GENERALLY AREN'T I DO KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE DON'T GET THEM OUT 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DO WANT TO KNOW WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE'S LOOKS LIKE AM I DONE 
IF I WAS GOING TO BARE ALL I HAD A COUPLE OF OPTIONS 
I COULD EITHER TAKE A LEAD IN A MOVIE CALLED DAWN DOES DALLAS 
OR I COULD DO SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE TASTEFUL 
THANKFULLY FOR EVERYONE THAT KNOWS ME I OPTED FOR THE LATTER 
I WAS GOING TO BECOME A WORK OF ART 
AS I PREPARED TO POSE FOR A LIFE DRAWING I'D NEVER FELT SO VULNERABLE IN ALL MY LIFE 
I WAS ABOUT TO GET NAKED IN FRONT OF A GROUP OF STRANGERS WHO WERE GOING TO ANALYSE EVERY INCH OF MY BODY 
I WAS KIND OF EXPECTING IT TO BE MORE JOKEY BUT IT'S SERIOUS ARTISTS IN THERE 
THAT MEANS I KNOW THAT I CAN'T ABOUT BECAUSE IF I'VE GOT INSECURITIES 
THEN I'M JUST GONNA NOT GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT AND THEY DON'T WANT SOMEONE THAT'S ALL TENSE 
SO I NEED TO JUST GET MY HEAD AROUND THIS AND I CAN'T 
I CAN'T GET MY HEAD AROUND IT 
CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME ONE MINUTE 
HI EVERYBODY HELLO I'M DAWN 
HI DAWN HELLO DAWN I'M GONNA REALLY TRY NOT TO FREAK OUT AND RUN OUT THE DOOR 
I REALLY REALLY AM CALM DON'T WORRY YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT O. K. 
I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE 
BUT I WANT TO SUCCEED AT THIS 
I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING LOVELY AND STILL TO PAINT O. K. 
RIGHT SO IF YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR ROBE OFF 
RIGHT NOW THEN DO YOU FEEL HAPPY STANDING BY YOURSELF 
OR DO YOU WANT TO HOLD ONTO THE CHAIR OR I'M HAPPY STANDING BY MYSELF O. K. YEAH THAT LOOKS NICE 
THAT'S LOVELY O. K. VERY NICE 
LOVELY I'LL MOVE THE CHAIR OUT OF THE WAY 
RIGHT IF YOU CAN JUST THINK NICE THOUGHTS AND BREATHE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH DAWN 
O. K. 
LET'S MOVE ON AND WE'LL GET YOU SORTED FOR YOUR LONG POSE 
THANK YOU 
I'LL JUST TAKE THIS MAT AWAY 
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT YEAH I'M O. K. I'M SHAKING SO MUCH 
BUT YOU WERE EVER SO GOOD 
THANK YOU YOU WERE REALLY GOOD THANK YOU 
FIRSTLY I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO START CRYING 
I COULDN'T HOLD IT BACK AND THEN I KIND OF STARTED TO THINK REALLY LOGICALLY TO MYSELF 
AND THEN I JUST THOUGHT 
YOU KNOW IT'S A SILLY ILLOGICAL FEAR OF MY OWN BODY 
AND THEN I WAS FINE AGAIN ABSOLUTELY FINE AGAIN 
I'M SURE WHEN I SEE THE PICTURES I'LL GO ARGH 
I'M SO HOT 
I REALLY LIKE THAT ONE WHO DID THAT ONE MAINE 
I'M QUITE CURVY AREN'T I 
LOOK AT MY BOTTOM 
I FELT YOUR TENSION OR TENTATIVENESS COMING OVER VERY MUCH 
OH REALLY 
I SPEND MY WHOLE TIME DRESSING MYSELF IN A WAY THAT FLATTERS ME 
AND HIDES MY BAD BITS AND EMPHASISES MY GOOD BITS AND I TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN THAT WHEN I THINK ABOUT FASHION 
AND TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE EVERY BIT THAT YOU SPEND YOUR ENTIRE TIME TRYING TO COVER UP 
IS JUST OUT THERE IT JUST FELT LIKE WHAT WAS THE POINT IN ALL THOSE YEARS OF TRYING TO COVER IT UP 
I'VE JUST BEEN WASTING MY TIME 
SO WHY DID I SUFFER FROM ALL THESE HANG UPS IN THE FIRST PLACE 
I COULDN'T HELP BUT THINK IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHAT I'VE BEEN COMPARING MYSELF TO 
LOOK AT THIS PICTURE OF JENNIFER LOPEZ ON THE FRONT OF THIS MAGAZINE 
I'VE GOT PRETTY CLEAR SKIN IN REAL LIFE PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY TO ME OH YOU'VE GOT NICE CLEAR SKIN 
BUT LOOK AT HER SHE ACTUALLY LOOKS PROSTHETIC 
IT IS SO FLAWLESS AND SO TOUCHED UP 
BUT SEE I LOOK AT THAT AND I JUST THINK 
NOW THAT'S CLEAR SKIN THIS ISN'T 
O. K. I DON'T HAVE SPOTS 
BUT I NEED THAT KIND OF CLEARNESS YOU KNOW LOOK AT ME 
I'VE GOT MY LITTLE IMPERFECTIONS AND SKIN HAS MOVEMENT AND CREASES AND LUMPS AND BUMPS AND MOLES YOU KNOW 
WE HAVE WRINKLES AND ALL THESE THINGS BUT IN THESE PICTURES NONE OF THAT EXISTS 
NONE OF THAT EXISTS AND NO MATTER WHAT SIZE YOU ARE OR 
HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU THINK YOU ARE IN DAY TO DAY LIFE YOU CANNOT HELP BUT LOOK AT THESE PICTURES AND THINK 
I DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT 
THE QUESTION WAS COULD I EVER LOOK LIKE THAT 
I BOOKED A SESSION WITH A TOP LONDON PHOTOGRAPHER WHO HAD THE UNENVIABLE TASK OF TRYING TO MAKE ME PERFECT 
I'M GOING TO BASICALLY START OFF AS I AM NOW 
AND THEN SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO TO ME TO MAKE ME REALLY BEAUTIFUL 
REMEMBER THIS REMEMBER THE NATURAL LOOK 
O. K. PERFECT 
AND AFTER SIX HOURS OF HAIR MAKE UP AND WHAT IS PERHAPS BEST DESCRIBED 
AS DIGITAL COSMETIC SURGERY THERE I WAS PERFECT 
O. K. SO THAT'S THE FINISHED PRODUCT 
WOW 
WHEN I SAW THE SECOND ONE LIKE THAT 
I THOUGHT YEAH THAT'S A PICTURE OF ME THAT'S WHAT I LOOK LIKE 
WHEN YOU SEE IT COMPARED TO THE FIRST ONE YOU GO OH GOD NO I DON'T 
I CAN SEE HOW IT COULD GET ADDICTIVE YOU SEE YOURSELF LIKE THAT 
AND THEN LIKE THAT AND THINK THAT'S WHAT I WANT THE WORLD TO SEE 
I CAN COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO AND WHY IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE 
THAT PHOTOGRAPH'S BEAUTIFUL BUT FOR ME I'D FIND IT REALLY HARD 
BEING NORMAL I'D FEEL LIKE PEOPLE WERE GOING SEE SHE'S ACTUALLY QUITE POCKY 
OH GOD THAT'S JUST A TRAGEDY 
THAT'S THE VERY FIRST AND THIS WAS AT THE END OF MAKE UP 
IT'S THE EYES THAT AMAZED ME BECAUSE MY EYES LOOK QUITE THEY'RE QUITE CLOSED 
THAT ONE THERE HAD A SLIGHT SQUINT IN IT SO WE'VE TAKEN THAT EYE AND REPLACED THAT EYE 
SO YOU'VE SWAPPED MY EYES OVER MM 
YOUR NOSE HAS BEEN REDUCED YEAH 
NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH YOUR NOSE 
NO I CAN SEE THAT IT HASN'T GOT QUITE SUCH A BOBBLE ON THE END 
YEAH IT'S BEEN TAKEN DOWN A BIT 
I DIDN'T EVEN REALISE YOU'D TAKEN MY MOLES AWAY 
GOD I LOOK BEAUTIFUL 
THANK YOU YEAH 
YOU MADE ME BEAUTIFUL 
I'D BEEN SO IMPRESSED BY WHAT THEY MANAGED TO ACHIEVE WITH MY FACE 
I COULDN'T RESIST SETTING THEM TO WORK ON THE REST OF MY BODY 
AND HEY PRESTO A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER I'D GOT THE PERFECT BODY 
AND DISCOVERED THE GREATEST BEAUTY SECRET OF THEM ALL 
IT DIDN'T COME IN A JAR 
AND DOES EVERY PHOTO THAT WE SEE HAVE THIS DONE TO IT DO YOU THINK IN MAGAZINES 
I'D SAY NOWADAYS MOST REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE AGE OLD ADAGE THAT THE CAMERA NEVER LIES 
WELL IT KIND OF ALWAYS DID DIDN'T IT AIRBRUSHING USED TO BE 
THE CAMERA ABSOLUTELY TO HIGH HEAVEN 
AIRBRUSHING HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE ALL THE OLD HOLLYWOOD STARS 
THAT'S THE WEIRD THING ISN'T IT WE KNOW IT'S FALSE 
EVERYONE KIND OF KNOWS BUT WE STILL TRY AND BE IT YEAH WHICH IS WHAT'S PUSHING IT 
OR FEEL INSECURE NEXT TO IT WHEN WE KNOW IT'S FALSE 
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT'S FALSE BUT THEY STILL ASPIRE TO IT 
I BET THAT WHEN YOU'VE DONE THIS TO ME I'LL LOOK AT THE IMAGE THAT ISN'T REALLY MY BODY 
AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL WANT TO ACHIEVE WHEN I KNOW 
I KNOW THAT YOU'VE JUST DONE IT ON A COMPUTER YEAH ABSOLUTELY 
I'M NOT DENYING IT THESE WOMEN LOOK ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE AND THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL 
AND ASPIRATIONALLY THEY ARE WHAT EVERYONE WOULD WANT TO LOOK LIKE 
BUT THE PROBLEM IS NONE OF US DO SO YOU PICK UP THESE MAGAZINES 
HIYA HELLO I WENT TO SEE JANE CUNNINGHAM AND PHILIPPA ROBERTS WHO 
FRUSTRATED AT HOW COMPANIES ARE FOREVER EXPLOITING WOMEN'S INSECURITIES 
HAVE COME UP WITH A CONSULTANCY TO ADVISE ON HOW BEST TO SELL TO WOMEN 
DO YOU RECOGNISE THAT LADY IF I COVER UP HER NAME 
NO THAT'S CATHERINE ZETA JONES 
THAT DOESN'T EVEN LOOK LIKE CATHERINE ZETA JONES OH MY GOD I THOUGHT IT WAS LIV TYLER AT FIRST 
OR TERI HATCHER THERE YOU GO 
THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY ISN'T IT 
THAT'S SO RETOUCHED AND THAT TO ME SAYS IT ALL 
SOMEONE WE KNOW VERY WELL WHO'S BEEN ON OUR SCREENS FOR YEARS 
YOU KNOW IF YOU WALKED PAST HER IN THE STREET YOU'D ABSOLUTELY KNOW WHO SHE WAS COMPLETELY ALMOST DEFORMED 
BUT ALSO GIVEN HOW ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL SHE IS IF THEY FEEL THEY HAVE TO DO THAT TO HER 
THEN WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT WOMEN WHO DON'T EVEN LOOK LIKE HER IN THE FIRST PLACE 
THERE PROBABLY IS SOMETHING QUITE INTERESTING IN WOMEN AND THEIR WILLINGNESS REALLY 
FOR A LONG TIME TO COMPLY WITH THE IMAGERY AND RATHER THAN EVER REBEL AGAINST IT OR TO STAND UP AND SAY 
WE DON'T WANT IT OTHER THAN WHEN THEY'RE LITERALLY ASKED LIKE IN A RESEARCH GROUP IS QUITE INTERESTING 
THERE IS SOMETHING I GUESS OBEDIENT OFTEN A SORT OF OBEDIENT GIRL 
IN WOMEN WHERE THEY DON'T WANT TO STAND UP AND SAY THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY NEED SOMEONE TO MAKE THE STAND FOR THEM 
IT'S KIND OF PACK MENTALITY WHICH I RECKON STEMS FROM THE SCHOOLYARD 
NO ONE WANTS TO BE DIFFERENT COS EVERYONE WANTS TO BE ACCEPTED YES 
SO NO ONE'S GONNA STAND UP AND GO IT'S O. K. TO WOBBLE UNTIL SOMEONE ELSE SAYS 
NO THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THE FUTURE OF ADVERTISING IS 
DO YOU THINK IN A FEW YEARS' TIME THIS WILL ALL BE NON EXISTENT 
AND THESE LEGS WILL MAYBE HAVE THE ODD KIND OF DIMPLE MARK ON THEM 
MAYBE SEE BAGGY KNEES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THINK THAT'S WHAT'LL BE GETTING 
I THINK THAT BRANDS WILL HAVE TO WORK A LOT HARDER AND INSTEAD OF RELYING ON WOMEN'S INSECURITIES 
AND PICKING ON THOSE THEY'LL HAVE TO DEVELOP A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH WOMEN 
IN A WAY THOSE BRANDS THAT HAVE BROKEN THE MOULD DO 
THEY GENERATE A CONVERSATION WITH WOMEN THEY EMPATHISE WITH WOMEN AND TREAT THEM LIKE PEOPLE 
BUILD A RELATIONSHIP AND COMMUNICATE WITH THEM 
IN A MORE PERSONABLE DIRECT WAY AS OPPOSED TO LYING TO THEM 
THE THING IS WE'VE ALL BOUGHT INTO THIS PICTURE OF PERFECTION AND IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY 
BUT AREN'T WE SOMEHOW MISSING THE BIGGER PICTURE 
I MEAN WHY WOULD WE WANT TO ASPIRE TO BE SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EVEN EXIST 
IT DOES WIND ME UP IT MAKES ME FEEL 
JUST A BIT BITTER 
I THINK IT'S A REAL BETRAYAL OF WOMEN ON OTHER WOMEN THAT GIRLS 
LIKE ME NORMAL LOOKING GIRLS ARE MADE TO FEEL CRAP ABOUT THEMSELVES 
FOR SOMEONE'S FINANCIAL GAIN 
AND I WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
I HAD AN IDEA WHAT BETTER WAY TO SHOW THE WORLD THE NAKED TRUTH 
THAN TO GET AS MANY ORDINARY WOMEN AS POSSIBLE DOWN TO THEIR BIRTHDAY SUIT FOR A VERY PUBLIC DISPLAY 
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO WORK OUT HOW I'M GONNA CONGREGATE ALL THESE WOMEN 
AND SO I JUST THOUGHT I COULD JUST USE MYSPACE 
AND THAT'S GONNA BECOME LIKE THE HUB OF MY CAMPAIGN 
AND SO I SET ABOUT ORGANISING WHAT I HOPED WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE FLASH MOB 
GET NAKED WITH ME 
I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A LOCATION FOR MY FLASH MOB AS YET 
I WANT SOMEWHERE SCENIC AIRY 
PREFERABLY NOT INHABITED BY CHILDREN 
CAN YOU IMAGINE IT 
IF I PULL THIS OFF IMAGINE HOW INCREDIBLE THIS MOMENT IS GONNA BE WHEN A SEA OF WOMEN JUST GO WOOAH 
I WASTED NO TIME AND TOOK TO THE STREETS IN SEARCH OF WOMEN WHO MIGHT BE WILLING TO TAKE PART 
YEAH EVERYTHING'S GOING RIGHT TO PLAN 
LADIES CAN I GIVE YOU ONE OF THESE 
I'M ORGANISING A HUGE NAKED FLASH MOB 
DON'T YOU WANT TO GET NAKED WITH ME 
GET NAKED 
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET NAKED 
EXCUSE ME CAN I GIVE YOU ONE OF MY FLYERS I'M ORGANISING A HUGE NAKED FLASH MOB 
UNFORTUNATELY PERSUADING PEOPLE WAS PROVING TO BE QUITE TRICKY 
I'M STANDING HERE IN MORE CLOTHES THAN I'VE EVER WORN IN MY LIFE ASKING PEOPLE TO GET NAKED 
EXCUSE ME I'M ORGANISING A HUGE NAKED FLASH MOB IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME 
SO CHECK OUT MY MYSPACE PAGE AND YOU CAN COME ALONG 
WILL YOU BE THERE I'M NOT JOKING CHECK OUT THE WEBSITE I'M SERIOUS 
PLEASE GET NAKED WITH ME 
NERVOUS THAT MY IDEA WAS GOING TO BE A COMPLETE WASHOUT 
I DECIDED TO TRY AND RECRUIT SOME OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS 
I MEAN IF I WAS TO SAY TO YOU NOW 
GET YOUR CLOTHES OFF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NO 
WHAT NOW YOU'D GET A NO WHY 
I'M NOT PREPARED FOR GETTING NAKED IN FRONT OF PEOPLE AT THE MOMENT 
WHY COME ON I RECKON WE SHOULD JUST TAKE OUR TOPS OFF NO WAY WHAT TO YOUR BRAS 
O. K. I WILL IF YOU WILL 
I'LL TAKE YOUR GLASS I'D HAVE TO COVER MY NIPPLES THOUGH 
GO ON COVER YOUR NIPPLES I'LL STAND OVER YOU WITH MY BOOBS OUT UNTIL 
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR SUCH A LONG TIME 
AND YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SO BODY CONSCIOUS 
AND YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD SUCH A PROBLEM WITH WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THAT DRESSING GOWN 
AND NOW SUDDENLY YOU'RE FLAUNTING YOURSELF SHOWING YOUR BODY AND 
YOU KNOW WHAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE DOING AND NOT HAVING THIS LIKE MASSIVE HANG UP ABOUT IT 
IT'S NOT THAT I HATED IT IT'S NOT THAT BAD 
BUT I WAS NEVER THE KIND OF PERSON WHO'D JUST GET MY BODY OUT 
BUT BY GOING THROUGH A PROCESS WITH MY BODY I'VE REALISED THAT 
MY INSECURITIES ARE TOTALLY ILLOGICAL AND THAT THE MAJORITY 
OF PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THAT ABOUT THEIR BODIES 
COS THEY DON'T GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE FILMS ABOUT IT AND GET IT OUT AND REALISE 
LIFE'S SO MUCH BETTER WHEN YOU DON'T GIVE YOURSELF A HARD TIME 
SADLY THE EVENING DIDN'T QUITE GO ACCORDING TO PLAN 
AND NONE OF MY FRIENDS AGREED TO GET THEIR BITS OUT FOR ME 
BYE GUYS THANKS FOR COMING 
IT WAS TIME TO STEP MY CAMPAIGN UP A NOTCH 
THIS WASN'T GOING TO BE EASY BUT I BELIEVE THAT SHE WHO DARES WINS 
I WANT TO GO HOME 
DOES MY BUM LOOK BIG IN THIS 
THAT GUY SAID IF YOU DIE TODAY YOU'LL GO STRAIGHT TO HELL MAKE SURE YOU REPENT 
RIGHT I HOPE IT'S WARM 
YES ME TOO TAKE CARE 
I'M TRYING TO ORGANISE AS MANY WOMEN AS POSSIBLE TO MEET ME AND JUST TAKE OUR CLOTHES OFF 
FOR WHAT PURPOSE FOR THE PURPOSE THAT WHAT REAL WOMEN LOOK LIKE 
AS OPPOSED TO THE PICTURES IN THE MAGAZINES OF WHAT PEOPLE THAT ARE AIRBRUSHED AND DON'T LOOK REAL 
SO I JUST WANT TO GET AS MANY WOMEN IN THE SAME PLACE AT THE SAME TIME 
SO WE CAN GO YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL ALL RIGHT HERE YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF BOTTLE I'M VERY DRUNK 
NO IT'S BRAVE 
BUT I'VE GOT TO DO IT WITHOUT THE SANDWICH BOARD O. K. PLEASE COME 
I'LL SAY GOOD LUCK THANK YOU 
TAKE THIS SO I CAN GET NAKED YES 
FANTASTIC I LOVE MY BODY I'LL GET NAKED 
I LOVE YOU IT ALL SEEMED TO BE GOING QUITE WELL UNTIL 
SO I DECIDED TO QUIT WHILE I WAS AHEAD 
IT WAS AT THAT POINT WHEN MY PRODUCER SUGGESTED I SHOULD MAYBE TAKE SOME LEGAL ADVICE 
FROM ONE OF THE LAWYERS AT THE B. B. C. 
RIGHT WELL I'VE BEEN 
ADVISED TO COME AND SPEAK TO YOU 
O. K. BECAUSE OF WHAT I'M TRYING TO ORCHESTRATE AT THE MOMENT 
I THINK THERE ARE PROBABLY TWO OFFENCES THAT YOU NEED TO CONSIDER 
ONE IS ACTUALLY A SEXUAL OFFENCE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE OF EXPOSURE 
UM IT DEPENDS WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE NAKED BECAUSE THIS OFFENCE IS ALL ABOUT EXPOSING YOUR GENITALS 
NOW BREASTS AREN'T REGARDED AS GENITALS IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES 
IT WOULD BE GENITALIA 
NOW UNLESS YOU RUN UP TO SOMEBODY REALLY PROVOCATIVELY AND DO A CARTWHEEL OR A HANDSTAND 
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE EXPOSING YOUR GENITALS AS SUCH 
I HAVE NO INTENTIONS OF DOING A CARTWHEEL WHEN I'M NAKED O. K. FINE 
I THINK THE OTHER ONE WHICH IS A BIT MORE LIKELY THAT YOU COULD BE ARRESTED FOR 
STILL A CRIMINAL OFFENCE IS A PUBLIC ORDER OFFENCE SECTION FIVE OF THE PUBLIC ORDER ACT 
KEY THING GET THE POLICE ON BOARD IN ADVANCE 
MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR MOTIVE FOR THIS IS YOU KNOW CELEBRATION OF THE FEMALE BODY 
IT'S NOT TO OFFEND OR UPSET ANYBODY 
AND BE COMPLETELY OPEN AND HONEST WITH THEM ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND GET THEM ON BOARD 
GET THEM ON YOUR SIDE AND YOU MAY EVEN END UP WITH A POLICE ESCORT 
MEANWHILE RUMOURS OF MY FLASH MOB STARTED TO SPREAD 
AND I WAS INVITED TO GO ON THE RADIO FOR A NAKED PHONE IN 
STAYING WITH YOU ON THE BREAKFAST SHOW 
DAWN PORTER IS TAKING YOUR CALLS COMPLETELY NAKED 
I ASK YOU TO DO THE SAME PERHAPS 
MAYBE WHEN YOU SPEAK TO DAWN IF YOU DO WANT TO SPEAK TO DAWN 
GET NAKED YOURSELF LET'S CELEBRATE 
COME ALONG LADIES ALL RIGHT WELL WE DO HAVE A CALLER 
JESSICA IN BASILDON MORNING JESSICA HI JESSICA 
GOOD MORNING ARE YOU NAKED 
UM WELL MORE OR LESS WHAT ARE YOU DOING NAKED 
DRIVING TO WORK 
O. K. DAWN YOU DID SAY YOU WOULD BE NAKED IF WE HAD A NAKED CALLER 
I KNOW I KNOW I'M GONNA START THE SLOW PROCESS 
RIGHT O. K. YOU SEE MY PROBLEM WITH THIS IS LIKE IF YOU JUST GO RIGHT ALL OFF I'M NAKED 
NOW IT'S TURNING INTO A STRIPTEASE 
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THERE'S NOBODY OUT THERE 
THAT'S PERFECT AND THERE'S A LOT OF SORT OF FILM STARS 
AND THINGS LIKE THAT IT GIVES WOMEN A LOT TO LIVE UP TO 
AND I THINK IT'LL HELP TAKE SOME OF THAT PRESSURE OFF 
IF MORE PEOPLE WERE TO DO THIS SORT OF THING AND APPRECIATE THE FEMALE BODY FOR WHAT IT IS' 
ABSOLUTELY DAWN'S LAUGHING AS SHE SITS HERE NAKED 
I'M NOT SURE SHE WAS QUITE AS PREPARED FOR THIS AS WE'D IMAGINED I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD DO IT 
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE RADIO I COULD GET AWAY WITH THE TOP 
YOU'RE STILL COMING TO TERMS WITH SITTING HERE NAKED 
YOU'RE NOT BRAZENLY GOING I'M NAKED EVERYONE ELSE SHOULD BE 
THIS DOCUMENTARY'S ABOUT ME GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE I CAN GET MYSELF NAKED 
IT'S NOT AN EASY THING TO DO AND I DON'T WANT TO PATRONISE IT 
GETTING YOUR BOOBS AND YOUR BITS OUT IS ACTUALLY QUITE QUITE HARD 
EVERY TIME I'VE DONE IT SO FAR ON THIS DOCUMENTARY AFTERWARDS I'VE JUST BEEN EUPHORIC 
IT'S BEEN BRILLIANT BUT BUILDING UP TO THAT MOMENT IS SO HARD 
AND I THINK ON THE DAY THAT WE DO THE FLASH MOB THAT'S WHAT WE WANT ARE WE GONNA DO IT 
COME ON LET'S JUST DO IT AFTERWARDS WE'LL PROBABLY GO TO THE PUB NAKED 
ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER AND SUDDENLY EVERYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT IT 
DAWN PORTER NEEDS YOUR HELP 
SHE'S HOPING TO ASSEMBLE THE ULTIMATE FLASH MOB 
AN EVENT IN WHICH HUNDREDS OF NAKED WOMEN WILL DESCEND 
ON A SECRET LOCATION AND BARE AS MUCH FLESH AS THEY LIKE IN A CELEBRATION OF THE FEMALE FORM 
SO BY THE TIME THE BIG DAY CAME I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN 
THE FLASH MOB IS LITERALLY IN A FEW HOURS AND I'M JUST PUTTING 
MY MESSAGE UP ON MYSPACE SAYING WHERE TO MEET 
OH DEAR I'M SO SCARED 
NO ONE'S GONNA TURN UP 
THE PLAN WAS SIMPLE 
IT'S THE BUS OH MY GOD 
I'D ARRANGED FOR AN OPEN TOP BUS TO TAKE ME AND AS MANY GIRLS AS I COULD GATHER ON A NAKED TOUR OF LONDON 
COMPLETE WITH MY UNTOUCHED NAKED PHOTO ON THE SIDE 
THAT'S QUITE LARGE 
I FIND IT REALLY SHOCKING TO LOOK AT IT'S A SHOCKING IMAGE BECAUSE YOU SEE EVERYTHING 
EVEN THOUGH IT'S MY BODY AND I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S ON IT IT'S STILL QUITE SHOCKING 
REALLY BAD CORNED BEEF 
BUT I'M PROUD OF THAT I'M PROUD OF THE FACT THAT I'M NOT SMASHING THE BUS UP 
WITH A NUMBER OF STOPS DOTTED AROUND THE CITY I HOPED THAT 
A SMALL ARMY OF WOMEN WOULD BE WILLING TO GET NAKED WITH ME 
LOADS OF PEOPLE HAD SAID THEY'D BE THERE BUT HOW MANY WOULD ACTUALLY TURN UP 
I'M JUST GONNA WAIT UNTIL THE FIRST STOP 
AND IF THERE'S SOMEONE THERE THEN I'LL GET NAKED 
I FEARED THAT MY PLAN MAY END UP BECOMING LITTLE MORE THAN AN ELABORATE STREAK 
AND THAT DEAR ROSA WOULDN'T BE THE ONLY DUMMY ON THE BUS THAT DAY 
OH GOD THIS IS THE FIRST STOP I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S GONNA BE THERE 
AS IT TURNED OUT I WASN'T ALONE IN MY DESIRE TO BARE ALL 
HIYA ARE YOU GUYS HERE FOR ME 
OH MY GOD THE RELIEF 
YAY 
O. K. COME ON WE CAN DO THIS ARE WE READY 
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO SHOW OTHER WOMEN WHAT REAL BODIES LOOK LIKE 
I CAN STARVE MYSELF TO DEATH I'LL NEVER BE TALL THIN AND BLONDE 
I AM WHO I AM SO 
AND I'M PROUD OF IT IT'S GOING TO BE VERY LIBERATING I CAN'T WAIT 
I FEEL A BIT HIPPIE WHICH IS NICE VERY EXCITING 
NOT SURE HOW ELSE I FEEL NEED A WEE 
I THINK WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS MARVELLOUS REALLY 
AT THE END OF THE DAY EVERYBODY'S NATURAL AND SHOULD BE WHAT THEY ARE 
I'M A REAL WOMAN AND I DON'T LOOK TOO BAD 
I'VE HAD SEVERAL CHILDREN AND I DON'T LOOK TOO BAD 
BUT I DON'T LOOK LIKE WHAT YOU SEE IN THAT MAGAZINE 
HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH 
I'M A BIG GIRL 
HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH 
I'VE GOT LOPSIDED BOOBS 
HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH 
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN QUITE BIG BUSTED SO I USED TO BE ASHAMED OF IT AND COVER UP AND THAT 
HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH 
I DON'T THINK I'M A BAD LOOKING WOMAN AND WHY SHOULDN'T I SHOW IT 
HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH 
BE YOURSELF AND IF IT FEELS LIKE GOOD AND RIGHT TO DO IT DO IT 
OH IT'S AMAZING OH I'M SO HAPPY 
LOOK AT THEM ALL 
I'M SO RELIEVED I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU I AM ABSOLUTELY OVER THE MOON ABSOLUTELY OVER THE MOON 
THIS IS GREAT ISN'T IT FANTASTIC 
COME ON 
WITH THE FLASH MOB IN FULL SWING IT WAS TIME TO SHOW THE WORLD WHAT WE WERE REALLY MADE OF 
I FEEL LIKE I'VE REALLY ACHIEVED SOMETHING I FEEL REALLY 
REALLY REALLY PROUD OF MYSELF AND THEM OF COURSE 
EVERYONE ON THE STREET LIKE LOADS OF WOMEN GOING THIS IS WICKED 
EVERYONE LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE REALLY ENJOYED JUST DOING IT 
YOU ALL LOOK AMAZING 
GET NAKED WITH ME 
GET NAKED WITH ME 
LONG LIVE THE WOMAN 
I LOVE MYSELF 
GET NAKED WITH US WHOO 
WITH A FEW SEATS TO SPARE I MADE A FINAL STOP TO TRY AND RECRUIT SOME MORE GIRLS 
WE'RE GOING TO CONDE NAST SEE IF ANY OF THE WOMEN 
THAT WORK THERE WANT TO COME AND UM HANG OUT ON THE BUS 
JUST GET AWAY FROM ALL THOSE FALSE IMAGES AND JUST HANG OUT WITH REAL GIRLS 
CONDE NAST IS A LEADING PUBLISHER 
OF BEAUTY MAGAZINES LIKE VOGUE AND GLAMOUR 
THE GIRLS WHO WORK THERE HAVE TO SPEND THEIR DAYS SURROUNDED BY TOUCHED UP IMAGES OF PERFECTION 
I'D ARRIVED UNANNOUNCED BUT THOUGHT AT LEAST SOME OF THEM MIGHT WELCOME A CHANGE OF SCENERY 
I'VE GOT A BUS FULL OF NAKED LADIES OUT THERE 
PLEASE JUST PHONE UPSTAIRS AND SEE IF ANY LADIES WILL JOIN US 
THEY WON'T COME DOWN AT ALL 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME ON MY BUS

I SAW YOUR NAKED BUS BUT I'VE GOT A VERY CLOTHED MEETING TO GO TO 
SO SORRY 
HELLO WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME ON MY NAKED BUS

YOU MUST GET SICK OF LOOKING AT THESE IMAGES OF FAKE BODIES ALL DAY 
I THOUGHT YOU'D WANT TO TAKE A BREAK FROM YOUR DESKS 
AND COME AND SIT WITH ME ON THE BUS WITH REAL LADIES 
YOU'LL BE IN TROUBLE I TELL YOU NOW I'M NOT TRYING TO CAUSE OFFENCE I WAS ASKED TO LEAVE 
BUT THEY DID PROMISE ME A PRESS OFFICER I'M NOT TRYING TO CAUSE ANY TROUBLE 
SORRY IS SHE EVEN COMING DOWN 
SHE SAID SHE'S COMING DOWN TO GET RID OF YOUS 
WILL SHE TALK TO ME OUT HERE HEY WILL SHE TALK TO ME OUT HERE YEAH 
WELL WHEN SHE COMES DOWN I'LL SEND HER OUT 
MEANWHILE I WAS FORCED TO CONTINUE MY SALES PITCH ON THE PAVEMENT 
I'VE GOT A WHOLE BUS OF NAKED LADIES WHO'VE HAD SUCH A GREAT PARTY AND I JUST WONDERED 
IF ANY OF YOU GIRLS JUST WANTED TO GET ON THE BUS AND JOIN US 
OH YOU ARE KIND THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ROUND BUT SORRY WE CAN'T HELP YOU OUT 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET ANYONE ON MY BUS NO SORRY 
I'M SORRY CONDE NAST AREN'T GOING TO GET ON OUR BUS 
OH BOO 
WE'LL CARRY ON OUR PARTY ANYWAY 
I KNEW THAT THE BEAUTY INDUSTRY WAS PROBABLY NEVER GOING TO CHANGE 
BUT BY GETTING NAKED I'D AT LEAST LEARNED TO LOVE MY BODY 
AFTER ALL IT'S THE ONLY ONE I'VE GOT 
AND NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY 
NOBODY'S PERFECT
