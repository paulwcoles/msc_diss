TONIGHT JAMES DRIVES A ROLLS ROYCE 
RICHARD DRIVES A BUGATTI VEYRON 
AND I DRIVE SOMETHING THAT IS NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS 
HELLO GOOD EVENING GOOD EVENING AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THANK YOU SO MUCH THANKS NOW 
WE START TONIGHT WITH A LETTER 
DEAR TOP GEAR WHY OH WHY DON'T YOU FEATURE MORE CARS AIMED AT ORDINARY PEOPLE LIKE ME 
YOURS SINCERELY MR. R. ABRAMOVICH OF CHELSEA 
WELL MR. ABRAMOVICH OUR MAN OF THE PEOPLE JAMES MAY 
WAS ONLY TOO HAPPY TO OBLIGE 
PERHAPS THIS IS WHAT HE'S ON ABOUT 
NO NOT THE GIN PALACE 
THIS 
THE NEW ROLLS ROYCE PHANTOM DROPHEAD 
AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW ON TOP GEAR IF A CAR SPENDS TOO LONG SITTING ON THE DECK OF AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER 
IT EVENTUALLY GETS LAUNCHED OFF THE RAMP THING DOWN AT THE END 
AND THIS DEFINITELY ISN'T GOING TO FLY BECAUSE IT WEIGHS TWENTY SIX TONNES 
SO LET'S BE ON OUR WAY 
THIS REALLY ISN'T THE SORT OF CAR YOU WANT TO DROP IN THE OCEAN 
LARGELY BECAUSE IT COSTS THREE HUNDRED SEVEN THOUSAND 
THAT'S FIFTY THOUSAND MORE THAN THE ROLLS ROYCE PHANTOM SALOON 
WHICH WE TESTED A FEW YEARS AGO AND WHICH I HAVE TO SAY 
WE LIKED RATHER A LOT 
SO WHAT ARE YOU PAYING THE EXTRA FOR ASIDE FROM THE DROP TOP 
WELL YOU CERTAINLY GET A LOT MORE METAL WORKING 
BECAUSE TO KEEP THE DROPHEAD'S BODY RIGID ROLLS GAVE IT TO THEIR ADOPTIVE PARENTS AT B. M. W. 
WHO ADDED ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY FEET OF WELDING 
AND THEY DID THAT AT THEIR CENTRE FOR ALUMINIUM COMPETENCE 
I'M NOT MAKING THAT UP THAT IS WHAT IT'S CALLED 
THEY'RE GERMANS 
OTHERWISE IT HAS THE SAME SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE LITRE ENGINE AS THE PHANTOM 
THE SAME TOP SPEED AND THE SAME ZERO TO SIXTY TIME 
SO THE MECHANICALS ARE THE SAME BUT THE IMAGE VERY DIFFERENT 
THE SALOON IS THE SORT OF CAR THAT YOU COULD HIDE IN 
YOU CAN SIT IN THE BACK BEHIND THE TINTED GLASS AND JUST PRETEND 
TO BE SELLING RUSSIAN GAS OR WHATEVER ON YOUR LAPTOP 
BUT WITH THE DROPHEAD IT WILL BE YOU WHO'S DOING THE DRIVING 
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO RIDE IN THE BACK OF THIS CAR UNLESS YOU'RE THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND OR ELTON JOHN 
WHICH IS THE SAME THING REALLY 
SO YOU'LL BE SITTING UP FRONT FOR ALL THE WORLD TO SEE 
IN A CAR THAT'S HARDLY DISCREET AND THIS IS WHY I'M DRIVING IT AROUND TOWN AT NIGHT 
BECAUSE THE PRODUCER THOUGHT I'D BE TOO EMBARRASSED IN DAYLIGHT 
BUT WHY WOULD I BE EMBARRASSED 
IF THIS WAS TRULY VULGAR MAYBE BUT IT ISN'T 
IT'S EXQUISITE 
THIS LOT DON'T DO CARBON FIBRE 
BUT THEY WILL LET YOU HAVE THIS TEAK DECKING AT THE BACK 
LIKE YOU MIGHT FIND ON A MOTOR LAUNCH 
AND THEY WILL ALSO LET YOU HAVE THE BONNET 
FINISHED IN BRUSHED STAINLESS STEEL 
AND OTHER CAR MANUFACTURERS ARE CURRENTLY SPENDING 
MILLIONS OF POUNDS ON RESEARCH INTO HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS AND HYBRID DRIVE 
BUT ROLLS ROYCE SPENDS THE SAME MONEY 
IN ITS ASHTRAY DESIGN DEPARTMENT 
LOOK AT THAT 
FURTHERMORE YOU WON'T BE OVERWHELMED BY ALL THE FLASHING LIGHTS AND GIZMOS AND GADGETS 
THAT YOU'D FIND IN A B. M. W. SEVEN SERIES OR A MAYBACH 
I DON'T HAVE TEN DIFFERENT SETTINGS FOR THE RIDE FIRMNESS 
I DON'T HAVE FIVE DIFFERENT SPEEDS 
AT WHICH THE INTERIOR LIGHTS SWITCH OFF WHEN I CLOSE THE DOOR 
IT'S MORE LIKE A BUTLER THIS CAR 
IT JUST SORT OF TAKES CARE OF EVERYTHING FOR YOU 
AND YOU DON'T EVEN NOTICE 
LIKE THE PHANTOM SALOON THE DROPHEAD DOESN'T FOLLOW THE HERD 
IT HAS ITS OWN IDEAS ABOUT WHAT A LUXURY CAR SHOULD BE 
YOU CAN'T ORDER A SPORTS PACK OR A FLAPPY PANELLED GEARBOX 
BUT YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM FORTY FOUR THOUSAND SHADES OF PAINT 
YOU KNOW THAT TEAK DECKING WHEN YOU TAKE THE CAR FOR A SERVICE 
A MAN IN AN APRON OILS IT FOR YOU LIKE YOU MIGHT YOUR FAVOURITE CRICKET BAT 
AND WHEN IT RAINS YES YOU CALL ON AN OLD FASHIONED SOFT TOP 
INSTEAD OF SOME TRENDY FOLDING METAL ORIGAMI 
BUT THAT SOFT TOP IS LINED WITH CASHMERE 
AND YET FOR ALL ITS TEAK AND STAINLESS STEEL AND CASHMERE 
THE DROPHEAD JUST DOESN'T COME ACROSS AS BRASH OR IN YOUR FACE 
I LIKE TO THINK YOU COULD LEAVE IT IN THE ROUGHER PARTS OF TOWN 
AND NO ONE WOULD HURT IT 
YO OH I LOVE YOU 
LET'S NOT TRY IT OUT THOUGH EH 
THIS IS WITHOUT DOUBT A PROPER ROLLS ROYCE 
WONDERFUL TO DRIVE BEAUTIFULLY MADE 
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE 
HERE'S AN AMAZING THING ROLLS ROYCE IS THE MOST ESTABLISHED MARQUE IN THE HISTORY OF MOTORING 
IT HAS THE MOST POMPOUS RADIATOR GRILLE 
IT HAS THE MOST RIDICULOUS MASCOT 
AND YET THIS CAR'S VERY VERY COOL 
I THINK THIS MIGHT BE THE COOLEST CAR IN THE WORLD 
DID YOU SAY IT WASN'T BRASH YEAH IT'S NOT BRASH AT ALL 
I'VE GOT TO SAY I'M WITH YOU IT'S AN EXQUISITE CAR 
TROUBLE IS THOUGH WHEN THE ROOF COMES BACK 
YOU KNOW A CLOCHE IN A STUPID RESTAURANT 
IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT ANY MORE CONVERTIBLE 
AND YOU SIT IN THE DAMN THING AND IT'S LIKE BEING IN A CONVERTIBLE RANGE ROVER YOU'RE SO HIGH UP 
YOU FEEL SO CONSPICUOUS I DIDN'T FEEL CONSPICUOUS IN IT 
THE THING IS I BELIEVE DEEP IN MY HEART THAT I LOOK GOOD IN IT 
AND IT SUITS ME COS IT'S STYLISH AND IT'S CONTEMPORARY 
EVERY TIME I SEE YOU THOSE ARE THE WORDS THAT POP INTO MY HEAD 
STYLISH AND CONTEMPORARY THANK YOU AFTER OTHER WORDS 
LIKE BEIGE STANNAH STAIRLIFT THE WAR THINK OF ANY MORE 
HOMOSEXUAL 
I OBJECT TO THE BEIGE 
NOW THE NEWS IMAGINE IF YOU WILL THAT YOU'D BOUGHT A BUGATTI VEYRON 
IT'S A BIG INVESTMENT YOU'D BE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE DAY IT ARRIVED 
SO YOU'D IMAGINE SUCH A THING WOULD BE DELIVERED LIKE A GOLDEN CARRIAGE ON A BED OF SWAN FEATHERS 
IT'S A SPECIAL MOMENT I'D WANT MINE BORNE ALOFT BY SIXTEEN GREASED NAKED EUNUCHS 
WHATEVER THE POINT IS THAT'S THE SORT OF THING YOU'D EXPECT 
IT'S A BIG MOMENT 
IN RUSSIA THEY DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY HERE IS ONE 
BEING TRANSPORTED 
I'VE BROUGHT YOUR BUGATTI SIR IT'S ON A FLAT BED PICK UP

I PROMISE FAITHFULLY THE OTHER DAY I WAS IN LONDON I USED AN ENTIRE 
'. NUMBER PLATE RESIDES SHUT UP 
USED AN ENTIRE CHARGE OF BATTERY JUST TO GET 
I GOT HALFWAY THROUGH THE NUMBER AND THE BATTERY DIED I HAD TO GO TO A SHOP BUY A CHARGER 
COME BACK THEN FINALLY YOU GET THROUGH TO A MAN WHO SAYS NO THE SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK 
HE ADMITTED IT IT DOESN'T WORK NO ONE CAN DO IT WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT KEN LIVINGSTONE 
IT'S HIS FAULT OBVIOUSLY I HAVE THIS PLAN 
BRING HIM DOWN HERE ALL RIGHT AND SET FIRE TO HIM 
THAT WOULD DO IT 
LIKE IT 
POPULAR BUT LOOK 
LOOK 
THIS IS THE PROBLEM WE'VE GOT 
YOU KNOW WE ACCIDENTALLY LIT PIPES LAST WEEK A BIT 
A HYSTERICAL WOMAN WHO RUNS SOME HYSTERICAL ORGANISATION SHE'S GOT THIN LIPS 
THE SORT WHO TAKE THEIR OWN LUNCH TO WORK YOU KNOW THE SORT 
SHE GOT IN TOUCH AND SHE POINTED OUT HAVING DEMANDED AN APOLOGY FROM THE B. B. C. 
SHE POINTED OUT THAT YOU CAN'T SMOKE NOW IN THE STU 
DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S HERBAL OR TOBACCO YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO 
WHICH MEANS IT IS NOW ILLEGAL TO INHALE THE MAYOR OF LONDON IF HE'S ON FIRE OH THAT'S BLOWN IT 
WHAT IF WE TURF HIM TURFHIM 
IS THAT SOME EUPHEMISM FROM THOSE SPECIAL CLUBS YOU GO TO 
YOU SEE A NICE BLOKE IN A LEATHER HAT I'D LOVE TO TURF HIM 
NO NO IT ISN'T 
I'M THINKING OF THAT ARTIST WHO TURFS BUILDINGS AND STATUES 
WHERE DO YOU LIVE HE DOES IT IN LONDON HE DID IT IN THE SOUTH BANK 
WE TURF KEN LIVINGSTONE STICK HIM ON A PLINTH JOB DONE 
WORD OF WARNING YOU KNOW YOU CAN NOW BUY RADAR GUIDED CRUISE CONTROL FOR YOUR CAR 
I FIRST TESTED IT WITH A MERCEDES AND I LIKED IT VERY MUCH THE IDEA IS YOU SET THE CRUISE CONTROL 
GO ALONG AT THE SPEED IF A CAR PULLS OUT IN FRONT OF YOU YOUR CAR SEES IT SLOWS YOU DOWN 
WHEN IT PULLS OVER YOU ACCELERATE BACK UP TO THE SPEED YOU SELECTED I THOUGHT THAT WAS GREAT 
AND THE BRAKE LIGHTS COME ON BUT IT'S PUTTING THE BRAKES ON TO SLOW YOU DOWN IT'S VERY CLEVER NO NO 
YOU SHOULD NEVER APPLY THE BRAKES ON A MOTORWAY BRAKE LIGHTS ARE WHAT CAUSES ALL THE TAILBACKS 
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T MAINTAIN A CONSTANT SPEED THOSE THAT DRIVE 
LIKE THIS BRAKING AND ACCELERATING 
I'D HAVE POLICE MARKSMEN SHOOT THEM IN THE HEAD 
I HAVE NEVER BRAKED ON A MOTORWAY 
WHAT IF SOMEBODY SWERVES AND YOU'VE GOTTA YOU SEEM THEM COMING 
IF IT'S AN OLD ROVER YOU KNOW IT'S BEING DRIVEN BY A MAN WITH EARS THE SIZE OF A SATELLITE DISH 
YOU DON'T NEED TO BRAKE YOU JUST PREPARE YOURSELF 
DO YOU KNOW THE GAME THE I HAVE NEVER GAME YOU THINK OF THINGS ALL ROUND THE TABLE 
I HAVE NEVER BRAKED NEVER BOUGHT ANYTHING IN MARKS AND AMP SPENCERS AND THEN IF YOU'RE LOSING 
YOU JUST GO FOR I HAVE NEVER USED A TAMPON 
I'LL REMEMBER THAT TIP 
I HAVE 
YOU'VE USED A TAMPON ARE YOU SURE 
OH MATE WHAT 
WELL I HAD A BIT OF AN ACCIDENT ON THE COOKER ONCE THIS IS GETTING WORSE HEAR ME OUT 
WHEN YOU'RE BOILING SOMETHING I WAS DOING SOMETHING WITH MILK AND IT BOILED OVER 
AND IT GOES IN THAT BIT IN THE BACK WHERE YOU CAN'T GET YOUR FINGER IN AND IF YOU DON'T CLEAN IT UP 
IF YOU DON'T CLEAN THAT OUT IT GOES RANCID AND IT SMELLS FOREVER YOU USED TAMPONS TO CLEAN A COOKER 
THIS IS THE I COULDN'T GET MY FINGER IN IT HE DOESN'T HAVE O. C. D. 
LISTEN NO YOU DO HAVE O. C. D. I DON'T 
YOU KNOW THE BEZEL ON A WATCH 
YOU KNOW THE LITTLE ARROW THING HERE IF I HAVE IT HERE HE'S FINE 
BUT IF I PUT IT ROUND READY IT'S LIKE KRYPTONITE 
GET OFF BACK IN THE RIGHT POSITION HE CAN'T BEAR IT IF I HAVEN'T GOT THAT ARROW 
LOOK 
SHALL I TELL YOU THE OTHER INTERESTING THING ABOUT TAMPONS 
SERIOUSLY HAS ANYBODY GOT AN OLD TWIN CYLINDER MOTORCYCLE 
YOU'LL KNOW THIS I WILL NOT YOU WILL YOU GET A BIT OF OIL THAT ALWAYS LEAKS OUT 
THROUGH THE SEAL AND COLLECTS AND YOU CAN'T GET AT IT TO MOP IT UP 
PUT A LILLETTE ON A SCREWDRIVER PHILLIPS POKE IT IN 
D'YOU CARRY THEM ROUND WITH YOU ON A BANDOLIER 
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER ARRANGEMENT FULL OF TAMPONS JUST IN CASE IT'S A NEW APPLICATION 
FOR AN EXISTING TECHNOLOGY 
JAMES GO AWAY 
I CAN'T STAND THAT HE CAN'T BEAR IT HONESTLY HE CAN'T BEAR IT IF I DO THAT 
ANYWAY PRAY SILENCE NOW PLEASE FOR THE MOST BREATHTAKING CAR WE'VE EVER HAD IN THE STUDIO 
IT'S THE NEW LAMBORGHINI REVENTON RE BENTON 
NO IT'S REVENTON NO NO RE BENTON 
I CAN PROVE IT LOOK IT'S GOT IT IN THERE IT'S GOT A V. REVENTON 
NO I KNOW IT'S SPELT WITH A V. BUT IT'S PRONOUNCED WITH A B. 
WHY DON'T KNOW THEY'VE TOLD US IT'S B. RE BENTON 
ANYWAY IT HAS A SIXTY FIVE LITRE V. TWELVE 
B. TWELVE YEAH WHATEVER 
IT CAN DO WHATEBER 
IT CAN DO TWO TWELVE M. P. H. BERY ANNOYING 
LEAVE IT 
IT IS AN AWE INSPIRING CAR 
IT IS HONESTLY I'M WITH YOU IT'S STYLED TO LOOK LIKE AN F. TWENTY TWO RAPTOR THE NEW STEALTH FIGHTER 
THIS IS WHAT LAMBORGHINI SHOULD BE DOING MAKING CARS WHERE YOU JUST GO 
WOW JUST FANTASTIC 
AND IT'S NOT JUST ON THE OUTSIDE IT'S CLEVER INSIDE TOO 
WE'VE GOT SOME PICTURES HERE 
THE DASHBOARD IS A THIN LIQUID FILM TRANSISTOR LIKE YOU GET IN AIRCRAFT THAT'S ON CAR SETTING 
IF WE SWITCH IT NOW TO AIRCRAFT SETTING LOOK AT THAT I WANT THAT IN MY LIFE 
YEAH IT'S JUST COVERED IN THINGS YOU WANT 
ROUND HERE THE REAR LIGHTS LEDS IN LITTLE ARROW SHAPES 
THESE ENORMOUS FANS DOWN HERE BEHIND THESE GRILLS 
ROUND HERE THE WHEELS HAVE GOT CARBON FIBRE FINS ON THEM 
THEY ACT AS A GIANT FAN TO SUCK IN COLD AIR TO COOL THE BRAKES OOH 
JUST A FUEL FILLER CAP LOOK AT THAT 
COUPLE OF PROBLEMS THEY'RE ONLY MAKING TWENTY ONE'S COMING TO BRITAIN THE OTHER THING I. S. EIGHT HUNDRED ZERO ZERO ZERO 
THAT IS QUITE A LOT M. M. M. BUT WITH THIS YOU WOULD GET A LOT OF BADGE 
BADGE 
OH NO NO NO 
I THINK I GOT AWAY WITH THAT 
LET'S MOVE ON TO FERRARI 
IN THE OLDEN DAYS THEY USED TO BUILD THEIR RACING CARS WITH A LOT OF PASSION AND ENTHUSIASM 
AND ON LAP THREE AS OFTEN AS NOT THEY'D EXPLODE IN A PASSIONATE AND ENTHUSIASTIC FIREBALL 
BUT A FEW YEARS AGO THEY STARTED BUILDING THEIR RACING CARS WITH SCIENCE AND MATHS 
AND SINCE THEN AS WE KNOW THEY'VE BEEN TOP OF THE TREE 
SO NOW FERRARI IS PUTTING SCIENCE AND MATHS INTO ITS ROAD CARS AS WELL 
THIS IS THE FIVE HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
IT HAS A SIX LITRE V. TWELVE WITH VARIABLE VALVE TIMING ON EACH OF ITS FOUR CAMS 
AND MAGNETO RHEOLOGICAL SHOCK ABSORBERS 
IT HAS LIGHTS ON THE STEERING WHEEL TELLING YOU WHEN TO CHANGE GEAR 
AND THEN THERE'S THE GEARBOX ITSELF 
WHEN I PULL THIS PADDLE HERE 
THE CLUTCH DISENGAGES THE COGS ARE SWAPPED AND THE CLUTCH RE ENGAGES ALL IN ONE HUNDRED MILLISECONDS 
READY 
YEAH ONE HUNDRED MILLISECONDS 
SEE THAT DIFFUSER AT THE BACK THAT'S GENERATING ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE KGS OF DOWNFORCE THAT IS 
THAT'S ABOUT THAT MUCH 
YOU CAN'T EVEN START THIS CAR IN THE NORMAL WAY 
TO GET IT OFF THE LINE YOU PULL THAT PADDLE TO PUT IT IN NO 
NO WAIT YOU TURN 
THE TRACTION CONTROL OFF 
YEAH THAT'S THAT DONE THEN YOU PULL THIS PADDLE TO PUT IT IN FIRST 
THEN YOU PRESS THE LAUNCH CONTROL BUTTON 
AND NOW THE L.'S FLASHING 
AND THEN YOU PUT YOUR LEFT FOOT ON THE BRAKE BUILD UP THE REVS 
TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF THE BRAKE TYRES SQUEAL 
THAT WAS HUGELY IMPRESSIVE 
BUT I'LL LET YOU INTO A LITTLE SECRET 
LAUNCH CONTROL IS PRIMARILY DESIGNED FOR FAT USELESS DRIVERS 
TO IMPRESS THEIR FRIENDS WITH ALL THE TYRE SMOKE AND SO ON 
THERE'S ANOTHER QUICKER WAY OF GETTING THIS CAR OFF THE LINE 
FERRARI WON'T THANK ME FOR THIS BUT WHAT YOU DO IS 
PUT IT IN RACE 
THEN YOU HOLD THIS PADDLE DOWN FOR TWO SECONDS 
IT SAYS TRANSMISSION FAILURE BUT DON'T WORRY 
LEFT FOOT ON THE BRAKE DON'T TURN THE LAUNCH CONTROL ON BUILD UP THE REVS 
TYRES SQUEAL 
THAT'S PHENOMENAL THE ONBOARD COMPUTER'S JUST GOT ME FROM ZERO TO SIXTY 
IN THIRTY FIVE SECONDS 
THREE POINT FIVE IN A CAR THAT WEIGHS NEARLY TWO TONS 
MORE AMAZING STILL IN THE TIME IT TAKES A TWO LITRE MONDEO TO GET FROM ZERO TO SIXTY 
THE FIVE HUNDRED NINETY NINE WILL GET YOU FROM ZERO TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
AND THEN THERE'S THE WAY IT GOES ROUND CORNERS 
WHAT I DO IN A NORMAL FAST CAR COMING ROUND HERE IS BRAKE 
TURN IN YOU FEEL THE GRIP O. K. 
THEN YOU BALANCE THE THROTTLE TO HOLD IT ON THE LIMIT OF GRIP AND THEN 
YOU CALL THE TOW TRUCK TO PULL YOU OUT OF THE FIELD 
IN THIS HOWEVER THINGS ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT 
I SIMPLY CHOOSE WHAT SORT OF CORNERING I'D LIKE TO DO WITH THIS LITTLE SWITCH 
SO IF I PUT IT HERE 
I CAN MAKE IT DO THIS 
OR IF I PUT IT HERE I CAN MAKE IT DO THIS 
HOLD ONTO YOUR SPLEEN EVERYONE 
OR IF YOU'RE FEELING BRAVE AND TALENTED 
YOU CAN TURN THE SYSTEM OFF ALL TOGETHER 
IN WHICH CASE YOU'LL CORNER LIKE THIS 
OH DEAR 
BIG CLOUD OF SMOKE 
AND THEN IT STALLS 
TO BE HONEST I DON'T REALLY LIKE ANY OF THIS 
ELECTRONIC STUFF I'M NOT THE SORT OF PERSON WHO SPENDS HIS EVENING ON BEBO OR MYFACE 
PROFOUND 
IN SHORT THIS DOES FOR OTHER CARS WHAT THE LAPTOP DID FOR THE TYPEWRITER 
AND BECAUSE IT'S SO HIGH TECH IT'S EASY TO DRIVE 
YOU MIGHT EVEN IMAGINE YOU COULD USE A FIVE HUNDRED NINETY NINE FOR TRIPS TO THE SHOPS 
BUT NOT SO FAST ON THAT ONE 
IN THE PAST THIS WAS THE NATURAL STOMPING GROUND OF THE FERRARI 
UNDER A COVER IN A GARAGE 
AND WITH GOOD REASON 
THE FIVE HUNDRED TWELVE WAS TOO DIFFICULT AND HEAVY TO BE USED AS A EVERYDAY CAR 
THE ENZO HAS PROBLEMS TOO 
IT WAS ONLY AVAILABLE WITH LEFTHAND DRIVE SO IF YOU PULLED UP AT A SLIGHTLY OBLIQUE JUNCTION 
YOU COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS COMING 
THE FIVE HUNDRED NINETY NINE THOUGH LOOKS AS THOUGH IT GETS ROUND THESE PROBLEMS 
THERE'S A PARCEL SHELF IN THE BACK FOR YOUR GOLF CLUBS 
SERVICE INTERVALS ARE EVERY TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MILES 
DON'T HOWEVER BE FOOLED 
BECAUSE THERE ARE ONE OR TWO LITTLE ISSUES 
I TOOK ONE OF THESE OUT ON THE ROADS NEAR WHERE I LIVE 
AND IT WAS SO WIDE I SPENT MOST OF MY TIME IN THE DITCH 
OR THE HEDGE TRYING TO AVOID PEOPLE COMING THE OTHER WAY 
THE HEADLIGHTS WERE LIKE CANDLES IN JAM JARS 
THE AUTOMATIC WIPERS TURN THEMSELVES ON EVERY TIME IT STOPPED RAINING 
THE AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM HAD A MIND OF ITS OWN IT KEPT STEAMING UP 
AND THE AMBIENT LIGHTING DESIGNED TO BATHE THE INTERIOR IN A WARM GLOW 
LIT THE WHOLE THING UP LIKE A BATTLEFIELD 
YOU REALLY COULDN'T BUY A FIVE HUNDRED NINETY NINE TO USE EVERY DAY 
MORE WORRYINGLY THOUGH I WOULDN'T BUY ONE AT ALL 
YOU SEE IF IT'S A CAR YOU CAN ONLY REALLY USE ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS YOU WANT IT TO FEEL SPECIAL 
AND SOMEHOW IT DOESN'T 
TECHNICALLY IT'S BRILLIANT 
I RESPECT IT HUGELY IN THE SAME WAY THAT I RESPECT THE TECHNOLOGY IN MY IPOD BUT I DON'T LOVE IT 
AND THAT'S WHY IF I WERE GONNA BLOW ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND ON A FERRARI I'D WALK RIGHT PAST THE FIVE HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
AND GET ONE OF THESE 
IT'S A FERRARI TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE G. T. S. 
EVEN BY THE STANDARDS OF THE DAY 
THE PROP SHAFT FOR INSTANCE THAT LINKS THE ENGINE TO THE GEARBOX 
WAS NEVER ALIGNED PROPERLY SO IT'D WEAR OUT IMMEDIATELY 
AND THAT WAS A GOOD THING ACTUALLY 
COS OWNERS DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO FIND OUT THAT THE BRAKES WERE ACTUALLY MILK BOTTLE TOPS 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT 
NONE OF THAT MATTERS 
BECAUSE LOOK AT IT 
IT'S FOURTEEN FEET OF ALMOST NOTHING BUT PASSION AND FLAIR AND STYLE 
SO WHEN YOU DRIVE IT ONCE A YEAR MAYBE IT MAKES YOU FEEL 
SPECIAL 
THE FIVE HUNDRED NINETY NINE IS JUST A BUCKET LOAD OF SCIENCE AND MATHS 
WELL 
LOOK AT THIS IT IS AMAZING 
AS A TECHNICAL EXERCISE IT'S JUST ASTONISHING 
THE SCIENCE AND MATHS IS PHENOMENAL IN IT IT REALLY IS 
AND WOULD YOU REALLY RATHER HAVE THAT OLD TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE HONEST TO GOD I REALLY WOULD 
ANYWAY WE MUST NOW FIND OUT HOW FAST THIS CAR GOES ROUND OUR TRACK 
THAT MEANS HANDING IT OVER TO OUR TAME RACING DRIVER 
SOME SAME THAT HE GETS TERRIBLE ECZEMA ON HIS HELMET 
AND THAT IF HE'D BEEN THE VIDEO REF IN THE WORLD CUP RUGBY FINAL HE WOULD HAVE SEEN 
THAT OF COURSE IT WAS A TRY YOU BLIND AUSTRALIAN HALFWIT 
ALL WE KNOW IS HE'S CALLED THE STIG 
AND HE'S OFF 
LOTS OF SMOKE MOSTLY FROM THE TORTURED CLUTCH AS STIG GIVES IT THE BEANS IN THE SECRET LAUNCH MODE 
FIRST CORNER HE TURNS IN HARD 
THE TYRES SQUEAL MORE ROLL THAN YOU MIGHT EXPECT 
THAT IS A LOT 
A SIXTH SENSORY PERSON INTERACTS WITH THE WORLD WITNESSING ENERGY IN A DETACHED MODE 
MAGNETO RHEOLOGICAL DAMPERS IN SPORT TRACTION CONTROL OFF 
TAIL JUST FLICKING OUT THERE COMING INTO THE HAMMERHEAD VERY HARD ON THE BRAKES 
ALMOST BEAT THE A. B. S. THERE 
THAT'S A BIG DRIFT 
THIS MAY BE A V. TWELVE BUT GOD IT CAN DANCE 
USE THAT ENERGY TO BE MORE GIVING MORE SUPPORTIVE AND EFFECTIVE 
RIGHT NOW THE FULL FURY OF THAT ENZO ENGINE 
HERE IT GOES 
POWERS THROUGH THE FOLLOW THROUGH THROUGH THE TYRES 
THAT'S QUICK BUT IS IT SUPERCAR QUICK OR WILL THE FIVE HUNDRED NINETY NINE SOFTER G. T. SIDES SLOW IT DOWN 
COMING UP TO GAMBON NOW 
SUPER TIDY THROUGH THERE AND ACROSS THE LINE 
YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CAR THAT WEIGHS NEARLY TWO TONS 
LEATHER SEATS AIR CONDITIONING BIG BOOT 
AND IT DID IT FASTER THAN A FORD G. T. 
THAT IS TRULY STAGGERING 
BUT NOW WE MUST MOVE ON 
BECAUSE IT'S TIME TO PUT A STAR IN OUR REASONABLY PRICED CAR 
MY GUEST TONIGHT HOLDS AN AMAZING RECORD 
HE HAS BEEN SEEN IN THE FLESH BY MORE PEOPLE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANKIND 
AND THAT IS BECAUSE HE IS A MEMBER OF A BAND CALLED THE ROLLING STONES 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN RONNIE WOOD 
CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HELLO MATE STAGGERING 
ALL RIGHT I'M VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU GOOD 
I GUESS UM 
I GUESS YOU MUST BE UNNERVED BY A CROWD AS BIG AS THIS 
I KNOW FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE HERE IT'S NICE TO BE INTIMATE 
IT'S NOT INTIMATE IT'S HUGE 
IS THIS TRUE COS WE WERE WORKING OUT THE OTHER DAY 
WHAT DO YOU GET ON AN AVERAGE TOUR HOW MANY PEOPLE COME 
I RECKON MORE PEOPLE THAN THE POPE 
I'VE GOT TO GET STRAIGHT TO BUSINESS HERE 
YOU LOOK AT THE STONES YOU'VE ALL GOT GOOD HAIR 
HOW CAN YOU HAVE KNOWN THAT WHEN YOU ALL GOT TOGETHER 
WELL NONE OF US WANTED TO BE IN FLEETWOOD MAC 
HAIR'S AN IMPORTANT THING MUST BE THE GYPSY BLOOD 
YOU'RE THE FIRST MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY TO BE BORN ON DRY LAND IS THAT RIGHT 
ME AND MY TWO BROTHERS ALL THE REST OF THE FAMILY RIGHT BACK DOWN 
TO THE SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS THAT I TRACED SO FAR WERE ALL BORN ON THE WATER 
CANALS RATHER THAN ON THE CANALS 
I'VE GOT A CARAVAN FOR THE DRY LAND BIT YOU'RE KIDDING 
YEAH GOT A FEW ONE IN THE FRONT AND ONE IN THE BACK GARDEN 
WOULD YOU LIKE US TO DESTROY THEM 
NO I CAN DO THAT MYSELF 
HONESTLY WE'D BE EVEN BETTER THAN YOU AT DESTROYING THEM 
NOW YOU'VE GOT A BOOK OUT 
YEAH WHICH IS D. A. DAH YOU'VE BROUGHT ON 
IT'S CALLED RONNIE 
ONE THING HAVING READ IT THAT FASCINATES ME IS HOW ARE YOU STILL ALIVE 
GOOD QUESTION 
HOW DID YOU DO IT EVERY SINGLE THING IN YOUR LIFE WOULD HAVE KILLED ANYBODY ELSE 
THE DRUGS THE FIGHTS EVEN IN THE EARLY DAYS WITH JEFF BECK 
YEAH THE ESCAPES THE ESCAPES FROM MOTORWAY CAFES 
WHAT THE BLUE BOAR DAYS YEAH 
COS ALL THE BANDS USED TO MEET THERE AFTER DOING GIGS 
WE WOULD BE SITTING THERE AT THE SHANK OF THE EVENING 
AND OUTSIDE YOU COULD SEE THE GANGS GATHERING 
AND THEY'RE GOING WE'LL HAVE THAT LOT 
THE MODS AND ROCKERS GANGS WE DIDN'T KNOW WHICH ONE WOULD ATTACK US 
WE HAD TO PRETEND TO BE ON BOTH SIDES AND ALSO GET OUT OF THERE AND MAKE OUR ESCAPE 
SO WE HAD TO JUMP INTO THE CAR THROUGH THE WINDOW 
INTO THE BACK WHAT THE DUKES OF HAZZARD THROUGH THE WINDOW 
YEAH THE WINDOW WAS LUCKILY WOUND DOWN COS THEN THEY'D COME AT YOU WITH 
WITH BASEBALL BATS AND WHATEVER OTHER STICKS AND NAILS 
AND STUFF THEY COULD GET THEIR HANDS ON 
AND JEFF WOULD GET BEHIND THE DRIVER'S SEAT ONE AGAINST THE PETROL PUMP ONE AGAINST THE WALL 
BOOM BOOM GET OUT 
SO JEFF BECK'S NOT ONLY AN AMAZING GUITARIST HE'S ALSO A GETAWAY DRIVER 
HE IS OH YEAH 
I NOTICED IN YOUR BOOK IT'S LOOKING AT YOUR FRIENDS 
PEOPLE LIKE JOHN BELUSHI HENDRIX 
THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY A METHODIST BIBLE GROUP 
WHICH BRINGS US ROUND TO OUR DEARLY DEPARTED FRIEND KEITH MOON GOD BLESS HIM 
DRIVING UP THE STEPS THROUGH THE PLATE GLASS WINDOW 
AND SAYING COULD I HAVE MY ROOM KEY PLEASE 
YOU SAW HIM DO THAT YEAH AND HE PITCHED A TENT IN THE LOBBY OF THE BEVERLEY WILTSHIRE IN HOLLYWOOD 
BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T LET HIM IN SO HE SAID I'M STAYING ANYWAY 
THAT'S PROPER YOU WOULDN'T SEE DANIEL BEDINGFIELD DOING THAT 
BUT WHAT'S YOUR RECORD FOR STAYING UP 
SIX DAYS SIX NIGHTS WITH A CONCERT AFTER EVERY ONE 
WE WOULD PLAY MADISON SQUARE GARDEN 
KEITH AND I WOULD SAY WELL WE MIGHT AS WELL MAKE A NIGHT OF IT 
LET'S GO DOWN THE STUDIO WITH ERIC CLAPTON 
LET'S GO DOWN TO ELECTRIC LADY 
SO WE'D DO THAT EVERY NIGHT AND SAY THERE'S NO POINT GOING TO BED NOW WE'LL BE ON IN A FEW MORE HOURS 
AND SO THAT WENT ON FOR THE SECOND DAY THIRD DAY FOURTH DAY 
AND I SAID KEITH I GOTTA GET SOME REST 
NOBODY SLEEPS WHILE I'M AWAKE 
SO WE DID THE EXTRA TWO DAYS AND BEFORE WE KNEW IT WE HAD A NICE TWO DAY KIP 
I JUST THINK IT'S FANTASTIC 
AND THEN THERE WAS ALSO NOT JUST THE DANGER OF TOURING AND STAYING UP 
KEITH RICHARDS OBVIOUSLY WAS ARMED A LOT OF THE TIME AS WELL 
YEAH BEFORE THE GOOD OLD DAYS OF THE TERRORISTS 
AT THE AIRPORTS YOU USED TO BE ABLE TO CARRY A PIECE ON WITH YOU 
DID KEITH EVER SHOOT ANYBODY OR ANYTHING 
WELL HE SHOT BETWEEN SOMEBODY'S LEGS IN HIS ROOM ONCE THAT HE WAS MAD AT 
AND IT WENT THROUGH THE CEILING AND DISTURBED AN OLD PEOPLE'S CARD GAME IN THE ROOM BELOW 
WHY DO WE ALL HAVE THE JOBS WE HAVE WHY AREN'T WE IN BANDS 
DIDN'T HE SHOOT SOMEBODY'S GUITAR 
YEAH WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE HIS OWN GUITAR 
HE WAS MAD WITH MICK THAT NIGHT AND SAID I'M GONNA SHOOT HIS GUITAR 
SO HE GOT A PILLOW BANG AND I SAID TO THE ROADIE 
OH DEAR WHAT AM I GONNA TELL MICK 
HE SAID DON'T WORRY HE BORROWED IT FROM KEITH ANYWAY 
I WAS READING THE BOOK THINKING O. K. YOU LIVED THROUGH THE FIGHTS AND THE SIXTIES 
THE MODS AND THE ROCKERS ALL THE DRUGS AND ALL THE DRINK 
BUT WHEN YOU TAPED OVER YOUR WEDDING VIDEO 
WHAT DID YOU HAVE TO BRING THAT UP FOR 
NEARLY AN EARLY DIVORCE 
DID YOU ACTUALLY KILL HIM FOR THAT I NEARLY DID YOU NEARLY DID 
IT WAS ONLY THE LAST BIT OF IT 
YOU KNOW IN THE OLD DAYS WITH VIDEOS YOU'D PRESS STOP AND IT WOULD GO BACK ABOUT A FOOT OR SOMETHING 
SO WE'RE GETTING INTO JO SINGING AND THEN HE KISSED ME AT THE WEDDING RECEPTION 
AND THEN SUDDENLY AND IT'S JIMMY WHITE TO TAKE THE NEXT SHOT 
THERE'S ONE THING THAT WE ALL HAVE IN OUR HEADS REALLY ABOUT THE STONES 
AND THAT'S YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA ABOUT HOW THE WORLD WORKS ANY MORE 
YOU JUST LIVE THIS INCREDIBLE SEPARATE EXISTENCE 
IS THAT THE CASE OR ARE YOU IN TOUCH WITH HOW THE WORLD GOES 
IT IS DIFFICULT BEING ON TOUR AND GOING TO THE OFFICE WITH A POLICE ESCORT 
AND PRIVATE PLANES AND ALL THAT BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO ADJUST COMING OFF TOUR 
BUT IT'S JUST I FIND IT SO VERY DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE A ROLLING STONE 
I CAN'T IMAGINE MICK DRIVING KNOWING WHAT THE LEVERS WERE FOR 
I CAN'T SEE CHARLIE DRIVING EITHER HAS HE GOT A DRIVING LICENCE 
NO OH HE HASN'T SO HE'S GOT NO CAR 
HE OWNS A WONDERFUL LAGONDA 
AND HE'S GOT A COLLECTION OF RARE OLD CARS 
AND HE LIKES TO HEAR THE SOUND OF THE ENGINE BUT NOT REV IT UP 
HE DOESN'T LIKE TO REV IT UP OR GO ANYWHERE IN IT 
BUT HE GETS SUITS MADE OF THE SAME DESIGN AS THE CAR

HELEN MIRREN IS THERE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO POINT EIGHT 
WELL THAT HAS JUST BEEN THE BEST FUN HAVING YOU ON HONESTLY 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN RONNIE WOOD 
THAT'S FANTASTIC THANK YOU SO MUCH 
NOW OVER THE YEARS TECHNOLOGY HAS DONE A GREAT DEAL TO HELP OLD PEOPLE 
IT'S GIVEN THEM THE STANNAH STAIRLIFT 
THE ELECTRIC TIN OPENER AND THE RUBBERISED UNDERSHEET 
THIS LEXUS L. S. SIX HUNDRED CAN PARK ITSELF 
NOW HERE'S BASICALLY HOW IT WORKS 
AT THE BACK OF THE CAR THERE ARE SENSORS IN THE BUMPER 
THAT KNOW WHERE ITS EXTREMES ARE THERE'S A CAMERA HERE THAT LOOKS BEHIND 
AND WHEN HAMMOND PRESSES A LITTLE BUTTON 
IT WILL REVERSE AND STEER ITSELF INTO THAT SPOT 
YUP IT'S THAT EASY 
I JUST ENGAGE REVERSE GEAR I CAN SEE THE CAMERAS HERE 
I PRESS SOME BUTTONS AND STUFF AND IT PARKS 
HERE GOES THIS IS GONNA GO WELL 
HAMMOND I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT BUT THIS IS THE INSTRUCTION BOOK 
THAT I HAVE HERE FOR THE COMMAND SYSTEM 
YOU THINK YOU CAN DO IT WITHOUT READING IT 
WELL 
ALL RIGHT GO ON SEE IF I CARE 
GO ON THEN GO ON THEN 
I JUST TAKE MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE YEAH 
YEAH AND THEN IT GOES 
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING 
I'M NOT IT'S THE CAR 
NO 
STOP 
YOU'VE WRECKED THE COOL WALL 
WELL IT'S NEW TECHNOLOGY 
HAS ANYONE GOT ANY READING GLASSES 
I CAN'T READ THIS DAMN BOOK THANKS I PROMISE I'LL PAY YOU BACK 
RIGHT I'VE GOT A GREEN LIGHT AND I'VE HIT O. K. 
AND ER RIGHT 
IF I PUT MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE IT SLOWS IT DOWN 
YES YES 
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO 
I THINK I'VE SET THE RADAR WRONG 
WE'VE GOT TO READ THE BOOK 
A EQUALS B. C. A AND B. ARE EQUALLY FAR AWAY 
HOW CAN OLD PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THIS 
JEREMY WHAT JAMES YES 
BOTH OF YOU IS THE GREEN SQUARE IMPORTANT 
YES 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN IT'S WHERE YOU GO 
OH I PUT THAT IN THE COOL WALL 
AH I'VE MOVED IT IT'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE NOW 
SO THAT'S WHERE I GO 
HERE I GO I'VE GOT IT I'M NOT TOUCHING ANYTHING 
PLEASE TURN PLEASE GOD TURN 
TURN IT THE OTHER WAY 
IT'S DOING IT THE CAR HAS TO DO IT 
OOOOOH 
THAT'S NEARLY IN 
THAT'S PARKED 
THAT IS NEARLY THERE 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN GIVE THE CAR THAT NEARLY DID IT A ROUND OF APPLAUSE 
AND THE REALLY TREMENDOUS THING ABOUT THIS IS THIS CAR IS EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND 
THE OLD AGE PENSION AT THE MOMENT IS EIGHTY SEVEN POINT THREE OH 
WHICH MEANS IF YOU SAVE ALL YOUR MONEY DO WITHOUT FOOD AND WARMTH 
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BUY ONE OF THESE IN JUST EIGHTEEN YEARS 
WHO SAYS WE DON'T DO SENSIBLE CONSUMER ADVICE ON THIS SHOW 
AND THERE'S MORE BECAUSE AS THE COUNTRY BECOMES MORE AND MORE CROWDED 
AND THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS BECOME MORE AND MORE NOISY 
IT MAKES MORE AND MORE SENSE THAN EVER TO HAVE A SMALL CAR 
THERE ARE LOTS TO CHOOSE FROM 
I'VE GOT A SELECTION HERE VOLKSWAGEN POLO SUZUKI SWIFT 
AND THE CITROEN C. ONE 
THE TROUBLE IS NONE OF THESE CARS ARE REALLY SMALL 
FORTY YEARS AGO CAR MAKERS COULD SELL YOU SOMETHING MUCH SMALLER 
THE ORIGINAL MINI FOR EXAMPLE OR THE BUBBLE CAR 
BUT EVEN THESE AREN'T SMALL 
THE PEEL P. FIFTY 
THAT IS FIFTY FOUR INCHES LONG AND FORTY ONE INCHES WIDE 
IT'S LISTED IN THE GUINNESS BOOK OF RECORDS 
AS THE SMALLEST PRODUCTION CAR EVER 
WHAT I'M SURE YOU'RE EXPECTING ME TO DO NOW 
IS INTRODUCE RICHARD HAMMOND 
BUT WHAT I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO DO 
IS DRIVE IT TO WORK 
ALL ERM SIX FEET FIVE INCHES OF ME 
NO THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK I'LL HAVE TO HANG ON 
LEG FIRST AND THEN YES 
BUILT ON THE ISLE OF MAN IN THE EARLY SIXTIES 
THE P. FIFTY WAS SAID TO BE ALMOST CHEAPER THAN WALKING 
IT COST ONE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT AND DID ONE HUNDRED MILES TO THE GALLON 
IT SOUNDS PERFECT THEN FOR THE ROADS OF TODAY 
OF COURSE THERE ARE ONE OR TWO DRAWBACKS 
I CAN'T IMAGINE FOR INSTANCE THAT IT'S TERRIBLY SAFE 
NOT WHEN YOUR KNEES ARE THE CRUMPLE ZONES 
AND NOR IS IT VERY FAST 
WHAT I'VE GOT DOWN HERE BY MY RIGHT KNEE 
IN THE CABIN MAKING AN AWFUL LOT OF NOISE 
AND GENERATING QUITE A BIT OF HEAT 
IS THE FORTY NINE C. C. ENGINE FROM A MOPED 
TOP SPEED RATHER DEPENDS ON HOW BIG YOU ARE 
AND ERM ACTUALLY HOW MUCH YOU HAD FOR BREAKFAST 
REALISTICALLY EVEN THE SKINNIEST SHORTEST CHAP WITH THE WHITEST OF TEETH 
WILL STRUGGLE TO GET PAST THIRTY FIVE 
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE I'VE JUST THOUGHT OF AS WELL 
I HAVE TO PAY CONGESTION CHARGE FOR THIS IN THIS PART OF LONDON 
BUT THE CAMERA CREW IN THE LEXUS FOUR BY FOUR DON'T COS IT'S A HYBRID 
HOW FAIR'S THAT 
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M CREATING ANY POLLUTION AT ALL 
THE PEEL THEN IS NOT ONLY A HANDY WAY OF GETTING TO WORK 
BUT IT'S ALSO PRETTY PRACTICAL WHEN YOU GET THERE 
NORMALLY THE B. B. C. MAKE YOU MOOR UP IN AN UNDERGROUND CAR PARK 
BUT THE BAYS ARE ONLY BIG ENOUGH FOR ETHNIC PEACE BICYCLES AND FAIRTRADE GEE WHIZZES 
BECAUSE THIS IS SMALLER THAN AN ETHNIC PEACE BICYCLE 
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT PARKING AT ALL 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT A CAR THIS SMALL IS THAT IT'S VERY LIGHT 
WHICH MEANS THAT WHEN YOU GET TO WORK YOU JUST PICK IT UP AND CARRY IT INSIDE 
MORNING 
IN THE TOP GEAR OFFICE THE TEAM WERE KEEN TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE P. FIFTY 
I GIVE YOU THE FUTURE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN 
THE PEEL P. FIFTY I THINK IT'S FORTY FIVE HORSEPOWER 
YOU KNOW THOSE LITTLE TYKES CARS THAT ALL KIDS HAVE GOT 
THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME ONE DOOR 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE TOP GEAR TEAM SO ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT ANY CAR 
THERE'S A KOENIGSEGG DOWN IN THE CAR PARK OH RIGHT 
I'VE GOT A NEW FERRARI THERE NOT INTERESTED THIS 
EVEN JOHN HUMPHRYS DROPPED BY FOR A LOOK 
HAMMOND NO WELL CAN'T YOU JUST CLEAN THEM 
REALLY FOUR THOUSAND TO WHITEN THEM 
YOU'VE WHITE 
NO WELL I'LL STICK WITH THE YELLOW ONES O. K. 
TAKE CARE BYE 
WHO'S GOT THE CAR 
THAT'S FANTASTIC 
WHO'S STOLEN THE CAR 
GOD THE POWER UNDER THIS BONNET IT'S IMPRESSIVE 
WAHEY 
WHOA 
AH CLARKSON YOU'VE MET YOUR MATCH HERE WITH ME 
PLEASE DON'T JUST STEAL OUR THINGS D'YOU MIND 
THANKS VERY MUCH JOLLY NICE OF YOU 
SOON I WAS SUMMONED TO AN IMPORTANT B. B. C. MEETING 
MOST OF THE PEOPLE GOING WOULD BE WALKING BUT I WAS RUNNING LATE 
AND DECIDED TO USE THE CAR 
DOORS CLOSING 
FOURTH FLOOR 
FIONA BRUCE IS STANDING HERE THE NEWSREADER 
GROUND FLOOR 
SORRY FIONA COULD YOU GIVE ME A PUSH A PUSH OUT 
PLEASE COS IT'S GOT NO REVERSE GEAR ERM 
THANK YOU ALL RIGHT IN THERE 
THIS IS FINE THANKS 
SHE HAS GOT QUITE A NICE BOTTOM 
I SAID THAT OUT LOUD DIDN'T I 
AFTER A SHORT DRIVE I ARRIVED AT B. B. C. TELEVISION CENTRE 
UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH THIS IS THE MOST COMPLICATED BUILDING IN THE WORLD 
THEME FROM MIDNIGHT COWBOY BY JOHN BARRY 
I'VE WORKED AT THE B. B. C. FOR TWENTY YEARS AND I STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING 
TOMORROW'S WORLD WAS CANCELLED NOT BECAUSE THE PROGRAMME WASN'T INTERESTING 
BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE JUDITH HANN WAS LOST IN HERE 
REMEMBER JOHN NOAKES PETER PURVES FROM BLUE PETER THEY'RE IN HERE SOMEWHERE LOST 
HELLO CAN ANYONE HELP 
THANKS 
WHICH DEPARTMENT'S THIS 
I'M REALLY LOST NOW 
TALKS WITH GOVERNMENT MINISTERS ABOUT HOW TO HANDLE THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS 
THAT HAVE RESULTED FROM LAST MONTH'S FLOODS THE TOTAL BILL IS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT ONE FIVE B. 
MARK SIMPSON IS HERE SORRY 
SORRY EVERYONE SORRY 
EVENTUALLY THOUGH I MADE IT TO THE TOP LEVEL B. B. C. SEMINAR 
I BELIEVE WE'VE ALREADY MADE SIGNIFICANT INROADS INTO THE IMPLEMENTATION 
OF AN OPEN AND INCLUSIVE POLICY FOR THE ETHNOCENTRICALLY HOMOGENOUS OBJECTIVES OF THIS DEPARTMENT 
BUT I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE BIGGEST THREAT EVER TO FACE THE PEOPLES OF THIS WORLD 
AND MINIMISING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT THROUGH FUNCTIONAL USAGE 
IS A KEY RESPONSIBILITY OF ANYONE WHO USES A PHOTOCOPIER 
I HOPE THAT IN THIS SESSION WE CAN DISCUSS AND ADDRESS 
SADLY THE MEETING WENT ON SO LONG THERE WAS NO TIME LEFT FOR ANY PROGRAMME MAKING 
FOR THE ETHNOCENTRICALLY 
SO I HEADED HOME 
I REALLY THINK THAT TODAY I HAVE SEEN THE FUTURE 
AND IT COMES FROM NINETEEN SIXTY THREE 
THIS PEEL P. FIFTY REALLY IS BRILLIANT IF IT HAD A REVERSE GEAR 
I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS THE ABSOLUTE ULTIMATE REALLY OF PERSONAL MOBILITY 
THAT'S DERMOT MONAGHAN O. I. 
IT IS MONAGHAN MONAGHAN 
OH THANKS 
THANKS FOR THAT SORRY 
WE REALLY HAVE A BIG PROBLEM AT THE B. B. C. WITH NEWSREADERS 
JUST THE OTHER DAY WE WERE IN THE CANTEEN PAXMAN CAME THROUGH ON A HARLEY DAVIDSON 
THEY'RE OUT OF CONTROL 
IS THIS THE BEST CAR WE'VE EVER HAD ON TOP GEAR 
YES IT'S GENUINELY ASTONISHING 
BUT I THINK I CAN NOW GO ONE BETTER 
BECAUSE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I'M NOW ABLE TO REVEAL THE SPORTS VERSION ON THIS CAR 
NO WHO'D LIKE TO SEE IT 
YEAH HERE WE GO 
LOOK AT THAT IT'S JUST STAGGERING 
IT'S THE JETSONS 
I JUST WANT ONE OF THOSE THAT WOULD BE MY PERFECT TWO CAR GARAGE 
YEAH NOW A YEAR AGO JEREMY RACED JAMES AND ME FROM ITALY TO LONDON 
US IN HIS RIDICULOUS AEROPLANE AND JEREMY IN A BUGATTI VEYRON 
AND ANNOYINGLY HE WON 
THEN WE HEARD FROM A BUNCH OF AEROPLANE ENTHUSIASTS CALLED THE R. A. F. 
THEY SAID WHY DON'T YOU COME UP TO OUR PLACE AND WE'VE GOT YOU A PLANE 
THAT'LL GIVE YOUR CAR A RUN FOR ITS MONEY 
AND SINCE I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO HASN'T DRIVEN THE BUGATTI VEYRON YET I TOOK UP THE CHALLENGE 
YES THE ONE THOUSAND HORSEPOWER LEGEND IS BACK AND IF I'M HONEST I'M A BIT NERVOUS 
NOT BECAUSE OF THE CAR BUT THE BURDEN THAT NOW RESTS ON MY SHOULDERS 
WHEN JEREMY DROVE IT ALL HE HAD TO BEAT WAS AN INCOMPETENT JAMES AND A USELESS LITTLE AEROPLANE 
THEN WHEN JAMES WENT TO GERMANY AND MAXED IT THE CAR DIDN'T EVEN BREAK SWEAT 
BUT THIS TIME THE VEYRON'S HONOUR'S REALLY AT STAKE 
BECAUSE NEVER BEFORE HAS IT GONE UP AGAINST SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
THE MOST MODERN THE MOST HI TECH STRIKE FIGHTER ON THE PLANET 
THE EUROFIGHTER TYPHOON 
AND FOR ONCE WHEN IT COMES TO FIGURES THE BUGATTI REALLY IS TOP TRUMPED 
ITS TWIN ENGINES DEVELOP TWENTY ZERO ZERO ZERO L. B. OF THRUST EACH 
PUNCHING IT UP TO SIXTY FIVE ZERO ZERO ZERO F. T. 
AND A TOP SPEED OF OVER ONE FIVE HUNDRED M. P. H. 
THIS MACHINE IS THE CUTTING EDGE OF WHAT A PLANE CAN DO 
IT'S DESIGNED TO BE AERODYNAMICALLY UNSTABLE TO MAKE IT AS AGILE AS POSSIBLE IN A DOGFIGHT 
SO IT NEEDS SEVENTY COMPUTERS TO KEEP IT IN THE AIR AND IF THEY FAIL IT WOULD SIMPLY FALL OUT OF THE SKY 
IT'S A MIX OF SCIENCE FICTION AND BRUTE STRENGTH 
THESE WINGS HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE STRAIN OF HIGH SPEED MANOEUVRES 
THEY MIGHT LOOK SLIM BUT EACH ONE CAN TAKE THE WEIGHT OF THIRTY FIVE VOLKSWAGEN GOLFS 
ALL IN ALL A HANDY BIT OF KIT AS YOU'D EXPECT AT SIXTY SEVEN M. A POP 
FACED WITH THIS THE BUGATTI VEYRON IS THE CAR WORLD'S BEST SHOT AT CLINGING TO SOME HONOUR 
AND NO ONE KNOWS THE OUTCOME 
IN FACT BUGATTI'S SO CONCERNED THEY'VE SENT OVER TWO VEYRONS 
MAYBE THEY'RE GONNA TIE THEM TOGETHER OR SOMETHING 
THE SHOOT OUT WILL TAKE PLACE HERE ON THE MAIN RUNWAY AT R. A. F. CONINGSBY IN LINCOLNSHIRE 
HERE'S THE CHALLENGE A HORIZONTAL VERSUS VERTICAL DRAG RACE OVER TWO MILES 
HERE'S THE START FINISH LINE AND THE CAR AND PLANE 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET HOLD OF MODELS OF A VEYRON AND A EUROFIGHTER 
THE CAR WILL RACE DOWN THE RUNWAY FOR A MILE 
WHEN IT REACHES THE MILE MARKER TURN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
AND THEN RACE BACK DOWN OVER THE SAME MILE TO CROSS THE START FINISH LINE HERE 
MEANWHILE THE PLANE WILL TAKE OFF AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND COVER A MILE VERTICALLY 
WHEN IT'S DONE THE MILE IT TURNS AND SWOOPS BACK DOWN THE SAME MILE TO CROSS THE START FINISH LINE 
OR TO CRASH INTO A ONE M. SUPERCAR IT DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE AND YOUTUBE HAS A FIELD DAY 
OTHERWISE LAST ONE TO FINISH IS A VEGETARIAN SIMPLE AS THAT 
YOU MIGHT THINK THE PLANE WILL WALK IT 
BUT DON'T BE SO SURE 
THE CAR SHOULD HAVE THE EDGE OFF THE LINE 
IT WILL DO NOUGHT TO ONE HUNDRED IN FIFTY SEVEN SECONDS FOR GOD'S SAKE 
AND WHEN IT GETS TO THESE YELLOW DOTS WHICH MARK THE MILE POINT WHERE IT HAS TO TURN AROUND 
THE VEYRON HAS ANOTHER ADVANTAGE 
DOWN HERE ITS AWESOME BRAKES SHOULD COME INTO PLAY 
AND THEN THERE'S THE AIR BRAKE WHICH GENERATES THE SAME STOPPING POWER YOU'D GET IN A NORMAL HATCHBACK 
A STRAIGHT LINE IS A STRAIGHT LINE 
SO THE CAR DOES WHAT IT DOES THERE 
BUT HERE I'VE GOT TO BRAKE AS LATE AS POSSIBLE AND LOSE AS LITTLE TIME AS POSSIBLE MAKING THE TURN 
BEFORE THE RETURN MILE 
SO I RECKON IT'LL BE WON OR LOST HERE AT THIS END 
TRACTION CONTROL OFF GEARBOX TO MANUAL LAUNCH CONTROL 
LEFT FOOT ON BRAKE GIVE IT THE FULL BEANS ON THE THROTTLE 
THIS IS IT 
STAND BY ONE GIVE ME TWENTY SECONDS' 
AS DRAG RACES GO YOU WILL AGREE THIS IS QUITE A GOOD ONE 
WE ARE AWAY 
WE'RE NECK AND NECK 
I'M GETTING AWAY 
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M LOOKING IN WOW 
I CAN FEEL THE WASH FROM THE JET 
AND THERE IT GOES 
SO I'M FIGHTING FOR THE GERMANS AGAINST THE R. A. F. 
IF YOU'RE WATCHING THINKING THIS IS COOL IT IS 
AFTER JUST EIGHTEEN SECONDS I WAS DOING ONE EIGHTY EIGHT M. P. H. AND GETTING READY TO BRAKE FOR THE MILE TURN 
THAT'S AS LATE AS I DARE 
THIS IS WHERE IT'S WON OR LOST 
I'M ON THE RETURN MILE NOW 
THIS IS THE BEST RACE IN HISTORY 
IF I MESS THIS UP I MAY AS WELL GET A PAPER ROUND 
I WAS DOING ONE NINETY SIX M. P. H. BUT WAS IT ENOUGH 
I MUST STILL BE AHEAD I CAN'T SEE THE PLANE 
NO O. O. O. O. 
NO 
I SUSPECT I MAY GET SOME ABUSE FOR THIS 
YOU FAILED 
YOU ARE A VEGETARIAN AND YOU FAILED AND YOU'RE USELESS 
YES GOTTA ADMIT THOUGH IT IS QUITE A CAR 
OH IT IS BUT WHAT A PLANE 
AND HERE IS THE GUY WHO FLEW IT SQUADRON LEADER JIM WALSH 
WELL DONE 
MUST HAVE BEEN TERRIFYING 
WELL IT WAS NOT YOU HIM 
WHAT AM I DOING TODAY 
RICHARD HAMMOND'S COMING HE'S DRIVING A FAST CAR IN A STRAIGHT LINE ON A RUNWAY 
HE'S NOT GONNA GO CAN I DO NUCLEAR WAR INSTEAD 
SO WELL DONE MATE FANTASTIC 
NEXT WEEK WE ARE IN AFRICA FOR A TOP GEAR SPECIAL 
THE THREE OF US ARE DRIVING ACROSS THE SPINE OF THE CONTINENT

IT IS WORTH WATCHING TRUST ME SEE YOU THEN GOOD NIGHT
