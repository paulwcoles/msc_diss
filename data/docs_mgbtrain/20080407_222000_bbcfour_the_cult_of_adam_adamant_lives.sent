IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES THE B. B. C. SCORED A SHORT LIVED HIT WITH AN ACTION ADVENTURE SERIES 
ABOUT A SQUARE JAWED SWASHBUCKLING TIME TRAVELLER WHO DEALT A WEEKLY BLOW TO THE NATION'S BADDIES 
AH 
IT'S A MAN IN A BLOCK OF ICE 
POPULAR AT THE TIME BUT SINCE OVERLOOKED OUR CRYOGENICALLY FROZEN HERO 
HAS BEEN REVIVED BY A NEW GENERATION OF CULT T. V. FANS 
PEOPLE WOULD COME UP AND SAY WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THAT PROGRAMME 
WITH THE DEFROSTED VICTORIAN ADVENTURER 
YOU SAY OH ADAM ADAMANT LIVES AND THEY GO OH YEAH 
I THOUGHT NO ONE ELSE REMEMBERED THAT 
I THINK IT'S AS SIXTIES AS WALKING DOWN CARNABY STREET WITH KEITH RICHARDS 
OR LISTENING TO THE SMALL FACES OR LISTENING TO SGT PEPPER 
IT'S A GREAT POP ART EXPLOSION 
ADAM ADAMANT 
IT WAS MY JOB TO LOOK AT THE SIXTIES WITH THE BAFFLED EYE 
WE HAD THE MOST ENORMOUS FUN 
NO GUNS IF YOU PLEASE 
IT WAS SEEING THE VICTORIAN AGE FROM A MODERN PERSPECTIVE 
I WORK AT A DISCOTHEQUE 
A DISCOTHEQUE I CAN'T POSSIBLY IMAGINE WHAT THAT COULD BE MISS JONES 
IT WAS A SHOW THAT LINGERED IN THE MEMORY OF PEOPLE WHO SAW IT 
BECAUSE IT WAS THAT LATE SIXTIES BLACK AND WHITE RATHER STRANGE 
TWISTED IDEAS AND BIZARRE CHARACTERS IT'S THE SORT OF SHOW THAT YOU THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE DREAMED 
IT'S BASED ON A VERY SIMPLE BASIC IDEA WHICH ALL THE BEST SERIES ARE 
THAT'S THAT A DETECTIVE 
IN NINETEEN HUNDRED AND SOMETHING 
IS FROZEN INTO A BLOCK OF ICE AND THE THAWS OUT IN NINETEEN SIXTIES LONDON 
A HERO FIGURE IF YOU LIKE WHO'S GOOD AT EVERYTHING 
HIGHLY EDUCATED HE CAN FENCE 
HE CAN BOX 
HE CAN RIDE HORSES 
HE REVERES WOMEN AND PUTS THEM ON A PEDESTAL 
EVENTUALLY HE HAD A GIRL A SORT OF SIDEKICK RATHER LIKE BATMAN AND ROBIN 
AND SHE WAS REPRESENTING THE YOUTH OF THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
WITH HIS ACUMEN 
AND HER UP TO DATE NESS THEY SOLVED CRIMES 
YOU'RE PLANNING TO BLOW UP THE GOLDEN MILE TONIGHT 
HE WAS A GREAT GENTLEMAN ADVENTURER 
WHO LIVED ACCORDING 
TO A STRICT VICTORIAN CODE OF MORALS 
ADAM ADAMANT LIVES WAS THE B. B. C.'S ANSWER 
TO POPULAR I. T. V. SHOWS LIKE THE AVENGERS WHICH HAD BEEN ON THE GO SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY TWO 
AND SHARED THE SAME CREATIVE D. N. A. AND MAKES ADAM ADAMANT LIVES VERY MUCH A PRODUCT OF ITS TIME 
AT THAT TIME LONDON WAS BECOMING THE MOST EXCITING CITY ON EARTH 
WE HAD OF THE BEATLES WE WERE PRODUCING THE MOST EXCITING POP MUSIC ON EARTH 
WE'D TAKEN THE MINI SKIRT 
WHICH HAD MADE ALL THE GIRLS LOOK TERRIFIC AND IT WAS LIKE A BURSTING OUT 
KEEP IT HAPPY 
THE SIXTIES WAS THIS GREAT BREAKOUT OF MORALS AND HOW PEOPLE BEHAVED AND THE FACT THAT YOU FELT 
IF YOU WERE YOUNG YOU COULD ACHIEVE ANYTHING 
WITH YOUR FINGERS 
WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE THINGS 
PART OF THAT WAS IN TELEVISION COS TELEVISION ALSO 
WAS STILL A VERY YOUNG MEDIUM SO WE WERE ALL LEARNING 
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN CHARGE WERE EXCITING TO BE WITH AND OPEN TO IDEAS 
A LOT OF THINGS WERE DONE THAT WERE EXPERIMENTAL IN A SENSE 
ALTHOUGH IN GENERAL PRODUCTIONS FROM THE B. B. C.'S DRAMA DEPARTMENT LIKE ARMCHAIR THEATRE 
AND THE WEDNESDAY PLAY WHICH GAVE US UP THE JUNCTION 
WERE HIGHLY REGARDED NOT EVERYONE APPROVED 
MARY WHITEHOUSE THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE NATIONAL VIEWERS' AND LISTENERS' ASSOCIATION 
WAS PROVING TO BE A REGULAR PAIN IN THE NECK FOR DRAMA BOSS SYDNEY NEWMAN 
HE GOT FED UP WITH MARY WHITEHOUSE CONSTANTLY ATTACKING THE WEDNESDAY PLAY 
AND ANYTHING THAT THE DRAMA DEPARTMENT DID 
AS BEING ENTIRELY SORT OF SEXUALLY OFFENSIVE 
SO HE THOUGHT I'M GOING TO THINK OF A HERO FIGURE THAT'S GOING 
TO BE DEFENDING THE THE RIGHT OF WOMEN A SORT OF SAINT LIKE FIGURE 
SO IN FACT HE THOUGHT ORIGINALLY OF SOMEONE LIKE SEXTON BLAKE 
AS A BOY SYDNEY NEWMAN HAD BEEN A BIG FAN OF SEXTON BLAKE A SORT OF BOY'S OWN SHERLOCK HOLMES 
IT HAD LESS REASONING AND MORE THUMPING ALL GOOD CLEAN FUN 
BUT I THINK EITHER THEY COULDN'T GET THE RIGHTS OR HADN'T GOT THE RIGHTS 
OR SOMETHING SO THEY SAID LET'S DO SOMETHING LIKE SEXTON BLAKE AND CALL IT SIXTEN BLOCK OR SOMETHING 
SO SEXTON BLAKE WAS OUT OF THE PICTURE 
BUT THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING IN THE IDEA OF A VICTORIA ACTION HERO 
HE WAS LOOKING OUT OF HIS WINDOW ONE DAY AND HEARD THE PNEUMATIC DRILL GO BRRRRRR 
HE THOUGHT WHAT IF A VICTORIAN MAN CAME OUT OF THAT AS THEY DUG UP THE ROAD 
LOOK HERE LOOK 
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER AT THE TIME THE SIXTIES THERE WAS A BIG MOVE TOWARDS FANTASY ADVENTURE 
YOU HAD THE PRISONER THE AVENGERS THEN YOU HAD ADAM ADAMANT 
THE B. B. C. HAD GOT LEFT BEHIND ACTUALLY BECAUSE ALL THESE THINGS I'M TALKING ABOUT 
JASON KING THE CHAMPIONS WERE ALL I. T. V. SHOWS 
THE B. B. C. HAD NEVER QUITE THROWN OFF THE SHACKLES 
OF IT'S GOT TO BE REAL AND IT'S GOT TO IMPROVE THE MIND AND SO ON 
SYDNEY NEWMAN WANTED THE RIGHT PERSON TO TAKE CHARGE OF HIS NEW PROJECT 
DOCTOR WHO'S FOUNDING PRODUCER VERITY LAMBERT IMMEDIATELY SAW POTENTIAL 
IN THE CLASH OF CULTURES CONCEPT 
WELL I THINK WHAT APPEALED TO ME WAS REALLY THAT ESSENTIAL IDEA 
IDEA OF TRYING TO TAKE A LOOK TRYING TO STEP BACK AND TAKE A LOOK 
AT HOW WE WERE BEHAVING IN THE SIXTIES AND HOW IT WOULD LOOK TO SOMEBODY 
WHO SIMPLY CAME FROM A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ERA WITH DIFFERENT MORAL STANDINGS 
VERITY WOULD BE THE FIRST OF MANY WOMEN IN ADAM ADAMANT'S NEW NINETEEN SIXTIES LIFE 
WHICH IS PERHAPS WHY SYDNEY FELT THAT THE SHOW NEEDED A FEMININE PERSPECTIVE 
BUT VERITY'S PRESENCE AT THE B. B. C. CONFUSED MANY OF THE MALE STAFF 
SHE WAS VERY ATTRACTIVE ACTUALLY WHICH WAS A BIT UNNERVING REALLY 
COS I WASN'T USED TO DEALING WITH ATTRACTIVE PRODUCERS 
LET'S FACE IT I WASN'T USED TO DEALING WITH WOMEN PRODUCERS 
SHE WAS IN THE VANGUARD OF ALL THAT 
IT HAD ADVANTAGES IN THAT A LOT OF MEN DIDN'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH IT 
SO THEY WERE PERHAPS POLITER TO ME THAN THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN TO OTHER PEOPLE 
I SUPPOSE THAT GENERATION OF WOMEN WERE THE FIRST WOMEN TO WORK IN THE B. B. C. 
MOIRA ARMSTRONG WAS CERTAINLY THE FIRST WOMAN DIRECTOR THAT I WORKED WITH 
THERE WAS ONLY ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE OF US IN BOTH I. T. V. AND B. B. C. 
APART FROM BEING A WOMAN I WAS CONSIDERABLY YOUNGER I WAS ONLY TWENTY SIX 
I THINK THEY COULDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT I WAS DOING THERE REALLY 
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS SHE HAD TO DO WAS FIND A LEADING MAN 
WITH ALL THE RIGHT CREDENTIALS 
SOMEONE HIGHLY EDUCATED WHO COULD BOX COULD RIDE COULD FENCE 
I WAS THE GREATEST SWORDSMAN IN FRANCE 
AND VERITY LAMBERT SAW IT ME FENCING ABOUT 
AND THEY SENT FOR ME AT THE B. B. C. 
HE WAS IN A RATHER GOOD CLASSIC THREE PART PLAY 
I JUST LOVED HIS ELEGANCE 
I ONLY FIGHT WITH GENTLEMEN YOU CAN THINK YOURSELF LUCKY 
HE IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS A RATHER OLD WORLD CHARM ABOUT HIM 
HE WAS SLIGHTLY OLD FASHIONED 
I SAID IT'S A LOVELY IDEA BUT I CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE I'M SIGNED TO DO A PLAY ON BROADWAY 
A LOT OF ACTORS WHO CAME FROM THE THEATRE 
HAD A VERY 
NOT AN ATTITUDE AGAINST TELEVISION BUT THERE WAS THAT HANKERING FOR THE THEATRE AS WELL 
SO YOU HAD TO TRY AND PERSUADE PEOPLE 
YOU HAD TO FRIGHTEN ME 
THEY SAID LISTEN GERALD THIS IS GOING TO MAKE YOU FAMOUS 
YOU'RE TAKING OVER FROM THE MAN FROM UNCLE YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT 
THERE'S THE PHONE RING UP NEW YORK 
AFTER SOME HESITATION HE MADE THAT CALL 
RIGHT FROM THE START IT WAS OBVIOUS HE WAS RIGHT FOR THE PART 
GERALD WAS VERY POPULAR HE PHOTOGRAPHED TERRIBLY WELL HE WAS A VERY HANDSOME MAN 
SYDNEY NEWMAN WHO WAS SLIGHTLY MAD SAID HE'S GOT TO HAVE A WIDOW'S PEAK 
THEY WANTED TO MAKE HIM LOOK JUST 
THEY SPENT MILLIONS OF POUNDS ON THIS AMAZING WIG WITH THIS HUGE WIDOW'S PEAK 
THEN HE SAID HE'S GOT TO HAVE EYEBROWS 
AND 
THEY STUCK THESE DAMNED EYEBROWS ON ME 
THE PILOT WAS ORDERED AND FOR GERALD HIS WIG AND EYEBROWS T. V. STARDOM BECKONED 
BUT THE LEADING MAN BEGAN TO WONDER IF HE HAD MADE THE RIGHT DECISION 
THE FIRST NIGHT'S FILMING WE WENT UP TO JACK STRAW'S CASTLE 
WHICH IS A PUB IN HAMPSTEAD I SAT THERE AT ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK DRESSED 
UP IN A CLOAK IN THIS EVENING GEAR WITH THIS WIG AND THESE EYEBROWS 
I HAD FOUR LARGE WHISKIES THEN I GOT ON A WHITE HORSE AND GALLOPED UP THE DRIVE OF A HOUSE 
AND I WENT HOME AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND LOOKED AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR 
I SAID I HAVE BEEN ACTING IN THE THEATRE TO FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE 
I'M NOW GOING TO GO OUT TO FIFTEEN MILLION PEOPLE LOOKING LIKE THIS 
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING 
AND I SORT OF BURST INTO TEARS REALLY 
THE PILOT WHICH NOW FORMS PART OF EPISODE ONE 
DETAILS HOW HIS TREACHEROUS SWEETHEART LOUISE LURES ADAM INTO THE CLUTCHES OF THE MASKED MAN 
THE FACE WHO BEING ADAM'S ENEMY INJECTS HIM WITH A SERUM THAT SUSPENDS HIS LIFE INDEFINITELY 
HE THEN REALLY RUBS IT IN BY BURYING HIM ALIVE 
THIS UNPLEASANT SITUATION WOULD HAVE GONE ON FOREVER 
IF HE HADN'T HAVE BEEN DUG UP BY SOME WORKMEN IN PRESENT DAY NINETEEN SIXTIES 
IT'S A MAN IN A BLOCK OF ICE 
ADAM ADAMANT LIVES 
ADAM ADAMANT 
ADAM ADAMANT 
I MUST WARN THE KING ALL IN GOOD TIME BUT FIRST OF ALL 
PARANOID AND MUMBLING INCOHERENCES ABOUT THE KING 
ADAM IS TAKEN TO HOSPITAL BUT SOON GETS FED UP WITH THE N. H. S. 
PRODDING POKING AND STICKING THINGS INTO HIM SO MAKES A SHARP EXIT STRAIGHT INTO NINETEEN SIXTIES LONDON 
IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A SENSE OF REALISM OR PERHAPS DUE TO A LACK OF FUNDING 
THE CREW EMPLOYED SOME GUERRILLA FILM MAKING TECHNIQUES 
I STOOD ON ONE SIDE THEY PUT A CAMERA ON THE OTHER SIDE OF PICCADILLY CIRCUS 
THEY SAID GO I THREW OFF THE MAC TOOK OUT OF THE SWORD STICK AND WALKED OUT INTO THE TRAFFIC 
AS IF I'D NEVER SEEN BUSES AND TAXIS AND CARS BEFORE 
A TAXI DRIVER STARTED FOUR LETTER WORD CURSING HIS HEAD OFF 
AND IT BROUGHT THE WHOLE OF PICCADILLY TO A SCREECHING HALT 
BECAUSE IN THOSE DAYS PICCADILLY WAS ABLAZE WITH NEON LIGHTS 
TO HIM IT WAS AN INVENTION OF THE DEVIL 
WHEN THE WHOLE OF PICCADILLY HAD SNARLED UP WE PACKED UP THE CAMERA AND RAN BEFORE THE FUZZ CAME 
WELL IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO YOU COULD DO THAT SORT OF THING 
YOU DIDN'T ASK THE POLICE YOU JUST DID IT 
I SHALL TAKE MY STAND HERE 
LET GO OF ME BOY 
I'M NOT A BOY I'M A GIRL I'M NOT A BOY I'M A GIRL 
I SUPPOSE IN A WAY BECAUSE WE WANTED GERALD TO EPITOMISE THE VICTORIAN ERA 
WE REALLY WANTED SOMEONE TO PLAY GEORGINA WHO SAID SIXTIES 
JULIET HARMER WHO WE EVENTUALLY CAST SHE WAS A VERY SIXTIES GIRL 
JUST IN EVERYTHING IN TERMS OF THE WAY SHE LOOKED AND EVERYTHING 
SO WE HAD TO RECAST THAT PART 
FOR THE PILOT VERITY HAD CAST A. N. N. HOLLOWAY TO PLAY ADAM'S SIDEKICK 
BUT FOR THE REAL THING SHE CHOSE THE ATHLETIC JULIET HARMER 
TO PLAY MISS GEORGINA JONES 
THEY SAID COULD I RIDE I SAID YES COULD I SWIM 
AND COULD I DO THIS AND THAT 
YES I CAN SKI I THOUGHT IT SOUNDS GOOD 
YOU MIGHT BE GOING TO THE ALPS FOR A FEW EPISODES NO SUCH LUCK 
SHE'S CHARMING VERY FANCIABLE 
WHICH IS WHAT I DEMAND FROM A LEADING LADY 
LONG TUMBLING HAIR 
SHE WORE THOSE WONDERFUL CAPS 
SHE'S GOT LEGS ABOUT NINETY FOOT LONG 
SHE HAD A NAIVETE WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY ENCHANTING 
THE CHARACTERS FIRST COME INTO CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER 
WHEN THE BOYISH GEORGINA RESCUES ADAM FROM HIS PICCADILLY NIGHTMARE AND TAKES HIM BACK TO HER SIXTIES PAD 
HE PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE STOPPED OR ALLOWED ME TO HELP HIM 
WHEN HE FIRST FELL OVER WHEN WE FIRST MET IF I'D BEEN DRESSED AS A WOMAN 
WHO ARE YOU GEORGINA GEORGINA JONES YOU CAN CALL ME GEORGIE 
MISS JONES IT'S MASCULINE ATTIRE 
IS IT PART OF THE MADNESS OUTSIDE 
SOME PROTECTIVE DISGUISE PERHAPS HEY WATCH IT THIS GEAR COST ME A BUNDLE 
THIS GEAR COST ME A BUNDLE THAT IS SOME KIND OF CODE 
IT'S BOUND TO SEEM A BIT STRANGE STRANGE THE FIRES OF HELL COULD BE NO STRANGER 
YOU'LL FIND IT'S ALL QUITE NORMAL IN THE MORNING I VERY MUCH DOUBT THAT MISS JONES PLEASE REST WHERE AM I 
YOU'RE QUITE SAFE YOU'RE IN MY ROOM YOUR ROOM 
THEN I MUST LEAVE IMMEDIATELY 
WHY WELL THINK YOUR REPUTATION MISS JONES 
YOU SUDDENLY FIND YOU'VE BEEN ALONE IN AN APARTMENT WITH A WOMAN WITHOUT A CHAPERONE 
HE NEARLY RAN OUT OF THE PLACE 
IT WAS THE MOST APPALLING THING THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM FOR SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME 
OH DON'T BE SILLY I HAVEN'T GOT A REPUTATION 
ANYWAY I'LL BE WORKING MOST OF THE NIGHT I HESITATE TO THINK WHAT YOU MIGHT BE DOING 
AH 
WOULD YOU KINDLY CALL ME A HANDSOME CAB 
HE NEVER UNDERSTOOD GEORGINA JONES AT ALL 
SHE WAS LIKE A GNAT OR A WASP THAT THROUGHOUT THE SERIES HE KEPT BATTING AWAY 
ALMOST EVERYTHING WAS HEY MR. ADAMANT WAIT FOR ME 
WAS THE SORT OF END OF EVERY SCENE AS HE TRIED TO GET AWAY FROM HER AND SHE CAME RUSHING AFTERWARDS 
HEY HANDSOME WAIT FOR ME 
I THINK SHE WAS FASCINATED AND ALSO PROBABLY QUITE ATTRACTED TO ADAM ADAMANT IN HER OWN WAY 
HE WAS FOND OF HER LIKE AN UNCLE IS FOND OF NIECE I WOULD SAY 
WHAT SHE FELT YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASK JULIET HARMER 
I THINK THERE WAS A VERY SUBTLE SEXUAL SUBTEXT WHICH WAS NEVER IN YOUR FACE 
THEY DIDN'T WRITE THE SEX IN NO 
I DON'T KNOW WHY 
WHETHER THAT CAME OUT OF VERITY'S THINKING OR WHAT I'M NOT SURE 
THERE WAS A PLAQUE ON THE WALL ADAM ADAMANT GENTLEMAN ADVENTURER LIVED HERE 
OTHER REASONS SEX ISN'T ON THE CARDS COULD BE THAT ALL HIS FRIENDS ARE DEAD THAT HE HAS JUST 
LEARNED FROM MISS JONES THAT HIS HOME HAS BEEN KNOCKED DOWN AND THE POOR MAN HAS GROWN SIXTY YEARS OLDER 
YOU ARE DEAD YOU'RE NINETY NINE YEARS OLD MR. ADAMANT 
WHAT DID YOU SAY NINETY NINE 
BUT ADAM QUICKLY COMES TO TERMS WITH HIS PREDICAMENT AND IS SWIFTLY BACK 
TO HIS OLD CAREER AS A GENTLEMAN ADVENTURER WHAT EXACTLY WERE YOUR DUTIES 
VALET COOK BUTLER TAILOR IN MY DAY SIR 
HE EMPLOYEES AN EX PUNCH AND JUDY MAN AS HIS MANSERVANT 
JACK MAY COMPLETES THE SHOW'S CENTRAL TRIO AS SIMMS 
THANK YOU SIMMS 
JACK WAS A VERY VERY CLEVER FUNNY MAN 
HE WAS VERY ODD 
I LIKED JACK A LOT HE TEASED ME AND WE GOT ON VERY WELL 
A GREEDY YOUNG GIRL FROM COLOGNE SIMPLY COULDN'T LEAVE STARCHES ALONE 
AND THE SWEETS THAT SHE ATE MADE HER SO OVERWEIGHT HER SHADOW WEIGHED TWENTY TWO STONE 
A LOT OF THE SUAVENESS OF JACK WAS HIM THAT WAS HIS CHARACTER 
INTERESTED IN HORSE RACING MORE INTERESTED OFTEN THAN IN WHAT THE SCENE WAS ABOUT 
WE WOULD REHEARSE IN TWENTY FIVE MINUTE BURSTS 
COS AFTER EVERY TWENTY FIVE MINUTES HE'D SAY EXCUSE ME 
AND HE'S GO OVER TO THE PHONE IN THE CORNER OF THE STAGE ROOM 
YOU'D HEAR HIM TALKING TO HIS MAN OF BUSINESS 
IT WENT DOWN DID IT ALL RIGHT 
NOW IT'S SIX TO FOUR IS IT ALL RIGHT 
I'LL HAVE A BID ON THE SIX TO FOUR I THINK I MIGHT BACK THE OTHER ONE EACH WAY 
ALL RIGHT TALK TO YOU LATER AND WE'D HAVE ANOTHER QUICK REHEARSAL HELLO 
ADAM ADAMANT'S RESIDENCE GOOD EVENING 
AH CAME UP DID IT O. K. WOULD YOU DOUBLE IT UP ON THE NEXT ONE 
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE HE'D BE LOOKING AT THE RACING POST 
WHOOPS OH YOU SHOULDN'T INTERFERE WITH THE RUNNING OF THE HOUSE 
I FELT SORRY FOR YOU WASHING SHIRTS IN THE SINK HASN'T HE HEARD OF DRIP DRY 
YOU DON'T EXPECT HIM TO WEAR THOSE THESE ARE ALL HAND MADE 
SO EVERY WEEK AS SIMMS STAYS AT HOME TENDING TO HIS MASTER'S SHIRTS 
ADAM HEADS OFF TO INVESTIGATE THIS WEEK'S UP TO DATE CRIME 
THIS SYMBOL OF EDWARDIAN CHIVALRY DROVE THAT SYMBOL OF SIXTIES STYLE THE MINI COOPER S. 
GEORGINA WAS JUST AS FASHIONABLE ON HER VESPA 
I SUPPOSE WE TRIED TO LOOK AT WHAT EPITOMISED THE SIXTIES 
THE MINI CERTAINLY EPITOMISED THE SIXTIES 
I HAD ONE WE ALL HAD ONE PEOPLE ALL HAVE THEM NOW 
THERE ARE SO MANY MINIS BUT IT WAS THE SIXTIES SYMBOL 
AND THE SCOOTER AND THE FREEDOM 
MISS JONES I WISH TO TALK NOT DISLOCATE MY VERTEBRA 
IN FACT HE LEARNED TO DO A LOT OF THINGS THAT IN FACT HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IN NINETEEN OH TWO 
BECAUSE HE FOUND HIMSELF TAKING UP THE SAME POSITION 
IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AS HE HAD IN NINETEEN OH TWO BEING A SELF APPOINTED HERO FIGURE 
READY TO FIGHT WOMEN'S BATTLES AND READY TO DEFEAT ANY EVIL IN THE WORLD 
YOUR FLUFFY WILL BE RIGHT OVER TO TAKE YOUR ORDER SIR 
AND EVERY EPISODE WOULD PROVIDE ANOTHER ASPECT OF MODERN CULTURE 
FOR ADAM'S VICTORIAN AND EDWARDIAN VALUES TO CLASH WITH 
I WOULD HARDLY DESCRIBE THE MORAL DISINTEGRATION OF THESE YOUNG LADIES AS CUTE MADAM 
BECAUSE HE HAD THIS ATTITUDE THAT WOMEN WERE ON A PEDESTAL 
AND WOMEN WERE A CERTAIN WAY 
HE NEVER COULD QUITE BELIEVE THAT WOMEN WERE EVIL 
OR COULD BE EVIL OR COULD DO WRONG 
DO YOU ALWAYS DO WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO 
THERE WAS ONLY ONE WOMAN IN HIS LIFE 
AND THAT WAS IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR 
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE TO WHOM I HAVE EVER GIVEN MY HEART 
BUT ALAS DEAR LOUISE I'M AFRAID I JUST CANNOT ASK YOU TO BE MINE 
YOU SEE MY LOVE FOR YOU COULD BE USED AS A WEAPON TO DESTROY ME BY THE ENEMIES OF ENGLAND 
AND SHE HAD BROUGHT HIM LOW 
SHE WAS AN ACCOMPLICE OF THE FACE 
WHO PUT HIM IN THE BLOCK OF ICE WHICH IS WHERE IT ALL BEGAN 
FOR A MAN OF ADAM ADAMANT'S ILK THERE WAS ONLY GOING 
EVER TO BE ONE WOMAN EVEN THOUGH SHE HAD TREATED HIM APPALLINGLY 
WITH HIS UNQUESTIONING TRUST IN WOMANKIND HAVING SEEN HIM BURIED ALIVE 
FOR SIXTY ODD YEARS SURELY ADAM SHOULD HAVE CLOCKED THAT WOMEN WERE CAPABLE OF DASTARDLY DEEDS 
BUT NO WHAT ELSE 
THE OTHER THING YOU COULD RELY ON IN ADAM ADAMANT LIVES WAS A GOOD OLD SCRAP 
I WENT DOWN TO PINEWOOD ONE DAY TO DO ONE OF THESE GREAT FIGHTS 
THE GREAT DEREK WARE SAID TO ME ALL RIGHT GERALD I'LL SWING YOU A ROPE 
YOU GRAB THE ROPE YOU SWING ACROSS 
YOU JUMP OFF THEM ONTO A SPRINGBOARD 
UP ONTO THAT HORSE I'LL SWING YOU ANOTHER ROPE 
AND YOU SWING OUT OF THE OTHER WINDOW 
I SAID YES ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT 
I SAID DO YOU THINK YOU COULD SHOW ME IT ONCE THEN I'LL DO IT 
HE SAID DON'T BE SILLY GERALD THAT'S BLOODY DANGEROUS 
CONSIDERING IT WAS A FAMILY SHOW SOME OF THE FIGHT SCENES WERE QUITE VIOLENT 
YOU DID GET A SENSE THAT ADAM WAS A BIT OF A LOOSE CANNON 
LEAVING A TRAIL OF DEAD BODIES FOR THE AUTHORITIES TO CLEAN UP AFTER HIM 
BUT TEENAGE BOYS LOVED IT 
WELL THERE WAS A SORT OF BACKLASH AGAINST VIOLENCE AROUND ABOUT THAT TIME 
THERE'S ALWAYS A LITTLE THING GOING ON LIKE THE MARY WHITEHOUSE SYNDROME 
SOMEBODY GETS ON A HOBBYHORSE AND SAYS BEFORE THE WATERSHED 
AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING 
WE CERTAINLY WEREN'T CRITICISED FOR SEX OR BAD LANGUAGE IN ADAM ADAMANT 
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY 
BUT VIOLENCE WAS THE THING THEY FOUND TO CRITICISE THE MARY WHITEHOUSE BRIGADE 
I THINK WE'D TONED DOWN THE VIOLENCE IN THE SENSE THAT YOU DIDN'T SEE BLOOD OR PEOPLE GETTING KILLED 
IF YOU DID IT WAS WITH A SENSE OF HUMOUR 
AS WELL AS COMPLICATED FIGHT SCENES TO LEARN JULIET AND GERALD HAD LINES TO REMEMBER TOO 
A WHOLE SCRIPT EVERY SEVEN DAYS THIRTEEN ONE HOUR SHOWS IN THIRTEEN WEEKS WAS QUITE A TALL ORDER BY ANYONE'S STANDARDS 
I USED TO TURN UP ON A MONDAY NIGHT 
WE'D BE IN THE STUDIO SUNDAY AND THEN MONDAY 
WE'D TURN UP ON MONDAY NIGHT WITH AN HOUR AND A HALF TO DO IT 
YOU'D HAVE ALL OF THE SETS IN LITTLE BOXES AROUND THIS ONE STUDIO 
THERE'D BE SIX SETS HERE 
I HAD A NICE YOUNG MAN WHOSE ONLY JOB WAS TO GRAB ME 
AND SAY NOW YOU'RE IN THAT SET 
COS I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO 
HERE WE GO ABSOLUTE QUIET 
WELL A WEEK TO DO AN ENTIRE HOUR'S EPISODE IN 
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMEMBER ALL THE LINES IT WAS A SHEER ACT OF WILL 
I JUST OPENED MY MOUTH AND SOMETHING CAME OUT 
HOW CAN THEY TALK ABOUT IT IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS 
I THINK THAT WAS A LOT TO EXPECT 
I THINK PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF WE'D HAD A BIT MORE TIME 
FIFTEEN SECONDS 
AND IT WASN'T JUST THE ACTORS AND THE PRODUCTION CREW WHO WERE UNDER PRESSURE 
THE SCRIPTS WERE DASHED OFF SOME OF THEM 
I THINK THE IDEA WAS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
AND I THINK IF THE SCRIPTWRITERS HAD PERHAPS A BIT LONGER 
I NEVER REALLY FELT WE QUITE GOT THE RIGHT MIX OF HUMOUR AND ADVENTURE 
I THINK IN FACT WE WENT FAR TOO MUCH DOWN THE LINE OF 
DERRING DO AND DETECTIVES AND MURDERS AND THINGS 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A WHOLE LOT MORE SUBTLE 
THE SPEED OF THE THING WAS EXTRAORDINARY SO THAT IT WAS FLAWED 
RIGHT EVERYBODY HOLD IT THANK YOU STUDIO BACK AT SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY 
YES WELL THERE WERE A LOT OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS WHERE DID ADAM ADAMANT GET HIS MONEY 
WHERE DID HE LEARN TO DRIVE THAT MINI 
HOW DID HE KNOW HIS WAY AROUND LONDON 
COS IT AIN'T THE SAME AS IT WAS IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FOUR OR WHATEVER IT WAS 
WELL THERE JUST WASN'T TIME TO SORT THEM OUT 
DESPITE ITS MINOR FLAWS THE SHOW WAS STILL HUGELY POPULAR BUT THERE WAS STIFF COMPETITION 
FOR ADAM ADAMANT AND MISS GEORGINA JONES 
IN THE SHAPE OF JOHN STEED AND MISS EMMA PEEL 
THE FIGURES WERE AMAZING TWELVE MILLION OR SOMETHING 
THAT'S BY ANY STANDARDS THAT'S A LOT OF VIEWERS 
BUT I THINK THEY WENT DOWN IN THE SECOND SERIES 
THEN I THINK WE WERE PUT UP AGAINST THE AVENGERS 
WHETHER THAT WAS DELIBERATE OR NOT I DON'T KNOW 
ALL THIS TIME THE AVENGERS HAD BEEN A LURKING THREAT TO ADAM ADAMANT LIVES 
EDWARDIAN GENT AND BEAUTIFUL GIRL VERSUS EDWARDIAN GENT AND BEAUTIFUL GIRL 
MAYBE THIS SIMILARITY WAS BECAUSE THEY SHARED WRITERS 
ALTHOUGH THE AVENGERS HAD TWO WEEKS INSTEAD OF ONE WEEK TO MAKE THEIR SHOW 
THERE WAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SIMILARITY BECAUSE TONY WILLIAMSON 
WHO ONE TIME WAS THE STORY EDITOR ON ADAM ADAMANT WAS VERY CLOSELY CONNECTED TO THE AVENGERS 
HE'D WRITTEN SOME OF THE SCRIPTS AS WELL 
IN A HEAD ON RATINGS BATTLE WITH THE SLICKER SEXIER BETTER FUNDED AVENGERS THE AVENGERS WON 
THE B. B. C. DROPPED ADAM ADAMANT LIVES AFTER JUST TWO SERIES 
THE B. B. C. DECIDED 
JUST NOT TO SUPPORT IT 
MAYBE SOMEBODY IN THE B. B. C. THOUGHT WELL IT'S A BIT NONSENSICAL 
THEY'VE NEVER BEEN STRONG ON ESCAPIST FARE PURE ESCAPISM 
THAT WAS AS INDEED THE AVENGERS WAS AND SO ON 
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS A BIG THANK YOU PARTY IT JUST SORT OF FIZZLED OUT A BIT ACTUALLY 
PLEASE LET IT GO ON 
I THINK ADAM ADAMANT LIVES STILL HAS GREAT APPEAL NOW SIMPLY 
BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A GREAT SWINGING SIXTIES PIECE OF ENTERTAINMENT 
YOU HAVE BEEN PATIENT 
THERE IS A STRIPE OF T. V. THAT IS PARTICULARLY SUITABLE TO CULT 
AND I THINK ADAM ADAMANT REALLY FITS INTO THIS 
WHICH IS THE SORT OF BIZARRE ADVENTURE SHOW 
UNTIL VERY RECENTLY ADAM ADAMANT LIVES HAD SUCH HIGH CULT CREDENTIALS 
THAT YOU COULDN'T ACTUALLY SEE IT ANYWHERE 
BUT NOW THE SURVIVING EPISODES HAVE BEEN GIVEN A SPRING CLEAN 
AND RELEASED ON D. V. D. TO THE DELIGHT OF CULT T. V. FANS EVERYWHERE 
TO MARK THE OCCASION THE ORIGINAL CAST AND CREW WERE GUESTS OF HONOUR 
AT A SPECIAL SCREENING 
WE WENT TO THE BRITISH FILM INSTITUTE THE OTHER DAY 
AND SAW IT ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE ON THIS HUGE SCREEN WITH THE NEW REMASTERED COPY 
ONE PERSON SAID THIS IS A QUESTION FOR JULIET I SAID YES 
DID YOU GET ANY FAN MAIL 
I SAID YES I GOT MASSES IT WAS MOSTLY FROM FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BOYS 
MY HUSBAND SAID YES AND WE'RE ALL HERE TONIGHT 
TO MY AMAZEMENT THE PLACE WAS FULL BUT IT DOES STAND UP IT HAS A SORT OF GAIETY IT HAS 
IT'S HALFWAY BETWEEN A COMEDY AND DRAMA AND IT HAS AN ENORMOUS CHARM 
I THINK IT'S A SMASHING CONCEPT I NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY IT HASN'T BEEN REMADE ACTUALLY 
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE STARTLING NOW 
TO COME BACK FROM NINETEEN HUNDRED INTO TWO THOUSAND SIX 
COS THE DIFFERENCE IS ASTONISHING 
SO CLEVER 
BUT OH SO VULNERABLE 
YOU COULD ARGUE THAT ADAM ADAMANT IS BASICALLY ON INDEFINITE HIATUS 
THEY HAVEN'T SAID HE WON'T COME BACK 
IF ANYONE OUT THERE IS WILLING TO FIND OUT WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ADAM ADAMANT I'D WATCH IT 
I'D PROBABLY WRITE IT 
IF THEY REMADE IT 
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A BIT MORE OUTRAGEOUS I THINK 
AND THEY SHOULD REMAKE IT 
I DO FEEL AN ENORMOUS DEBT 
TO THAT GENTLEMEN 
AND TO VERITY AND TO SYDNEY NEWMAN 
WHAT ON EARTH'S THIS SIMMS YOUR CAKE SIR 
MY CAKE IT WAS MISS JONES'S IDEA BUT HAPPILY I MANAGED TO PERSUADE HER NOT TO BAKE IT HERSELF 
HOW THOUGHTFUL OF YOU BOTH OF YOU 
IT'S VERY WEIRD TO SEE YOURSELF AGED TWENTY THREE 
IT IS ME AND IT ISN'T ME 
IT'S A VERY VERY ODD FEELING 
INSIDE YOU'RE EXACTLY THE SAME PERSON 
HERE LIE THE EYEBROWS OF ADAM ADAMANT 
NINETEEN SIXTY SIX TO NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN 
LABOR IMPROBUS 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY YOU'RE THE NICEST ONE HUNDRED YEAR OLD I KNOW 
ALL THE BEST SIR
