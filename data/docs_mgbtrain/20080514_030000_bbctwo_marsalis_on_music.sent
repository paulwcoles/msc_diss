WELCOME TO B. B. C. SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
TONIGHT'S UNIT FOCUSES ON MUSIC 
IT FEATURES TWO INFLUENTIAL CONTEMPORARY JAZZ MUSICIANS WYNTON MARSALIS AND JOOLS HOLLAND 
MARSALIS ON MUSIC CONTRASTS THE MUSICAL APPROACHES OF A JAZZ BAND AND A YOUTH ORCHESTRA 
TO ILLUSTRATE STYLE AND CONSTRUCTION 
COOL KEYS IS AN EXCITING NEW PACKAGE 
IN WHICH JOOLS HOLLAND INTRODUCES STUDENTS TO THE BASICS OF JAZZ AND IMPROVISATION 
FIDDLE BOW REAL BY WYNTON MARSALIS 
I'M WYNTON MARSALIS THIS IS MY JAZZ ORCHESTRA 
VISITING THE STUDENTS OF THE TANGLEWOOD MUSIC CENTER ORCHESTRA 
UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE MAESTRO SEIJI OSAWA 
WE'RE HERE AT TANGLEWOOD PLAYING AND TALKING ABOUT MUSIC 
WHENEVER I TELL PEOPLE I PLAY JAZZ AND CLASSICAL MUSIC THEY SAY 
I THINK THAT MUSIC IS TOO HARD TO LISTEN TO I MEAN I KNOW IT'S GOOD BUT IT'S JUST TOO LONG AND BORING 
I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY SAY THAT MY FATHER'S A JAZZ MUSICIAN AND I NEVER USED TO LIKE WHAT HE PLAYED 
LET ALONE THOSE LONG LONG ORCHESTRA CONCERTS 
IT SEEMED LIKE THE MUSICAL IDEAS JUST KEPT CHANGING FOR EVER AND EVER I COULD NEVER FOCUS ON ONE THING 
NOW WHAT I HEARD ON THE RADIO YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME BABY REPEATED TWO THOUSAND TIMES 
YOU COULD UNDERSTAND THAT TO ME THAT WAS REAL MUSIC 
THE SAME BEAT OR PHRASE REPEATED WITH A LITTLE SOMETHING IN BETWEEN 
THE MUSIC WE'LL DISCUSS TONIGHT UNFOLDS THE WAY A GOOD STORY DOES 
JUST AS WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE CHARACTERS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS TO ENJOY A STORY 
WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY MUSICAL THEMES FOLLOW HOW THEY CHANGE AND REAPPEAR TO ENJOY AN EXTENDED PIECE OF MUSIC 
FORM IS THE WAY WE ORGANISE MUSICAL IDEAS 
WE'RE USED TO LIVING WITH FORMS EVERY DAY BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING LUNCH AT NOON DINNER IN THE EVENING 
THEN YOU GO TO BED THEN THE SAME THING NEXT DAY THAT'S REPETITION OF THE SAME FORM 
ALSO YOU HAVE MATH AT EIGHT A M. ENGLISH AT TEN A M. HISTORY AT ONE P. M. FORM OF A SCHOOL DAY LET'S SAY A THURSDAY 
THEN THE NEXT THURSDAY YOU DO THE SAME THING 
OR WHAT ABOUT CARTOONS ALL MORNING PLAY ALL DAY BED THAT MUST BE A WEEKEND 
THEN THE SAME THING NEXT WEEKEND 
KNOWING THE FORM MEANS YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND WHEN IT'LL HAPPEN 
BECAUSE THE FORM REPEATS YOU CAN RECOGNISE IT 
LISTENING TO A PIECE OF MUSIC UNFOLD CAN BE LIKE YOUR FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL 
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WILL HAPPEN BUT YOU HAVE A SCHEDULE THAT GIVES YOU SOME IDEA 
AS THE SCHOOL DAY DEVELOPS THROUGH ITS SCHEDULE SO AN EXTENDED PIECE OF MUSIC DEVELOPS THROUGH ITS FORM 
WHEN YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT FORM YOU CAN RECOGNISE MUSICAL EVENTS 
AND MAKE SOMETHING THAT WAS CONFUSING AND BORING UNDERSTANDABLE AND INTERESTING 
THEN YOU REALLY WILL KNOW WHAT MAKES LONGER PIECES OF MUSIC GOOD AND KNOW HOW TO HAVE FUN HEARING THEM UNFOLD 
YOU WON'T JUST SAY YEAH I LIKE THAT 
THE FIRST FORM I'LL SHOW YOU IS SONATA FORM 
IT TAKES US ON A MUSICAL JOURNEY FROM THIS GROUND FLOOR 
ALL UP HERE THEN ALL AROUND THROUGH OUR BUILDING 
BACK TO THE GROUND FLOOR OUR HOME 
THIS JOURNEY TAKES PLACE IN THREE SECTIONS 
STATEMENT 
FANTASIA 
AND RESTATEMENT 
AND IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT TO HEAR ONCE YOU KNOW WHAT TO LISTEN FOR 
THE HARDEST PART TO FOLLOW IS THE FIRST SECTION 
COS THAT'S WHEN WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY AND REMEMBER IMPORTANT THEMES 
IT'S JUST LIKE FOLLOWING A STORY 
THE HARDEST PART'S THE BEGINNING WHEN YOU'RE FINDING OUT WHO THE CHARACTERS ARE AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO 
NOW IN THE STATEMENT SECTION OF THIS PIECE PROKOFIEV'S CLASSICAL SYMPHONY 
WE'RE TRAVELLING FROM THIS THEME 
TO THIS DISTINCTIVELY DIFFERENT ONE 
IF THESE THEMES WERE ALL THERE WAS TO THE STATEMENT SECTION OF THE SONATA 
WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO REMEMBER THEM WE COULD JUST PLAY THIS 
BUT THAT WOULD BE A MIGHTY SHORT AND UNEVENTFUL JOURNEY IT'S TOO FAST 
IT'S LIKE TELLING A STORY YOU WOULDN'T JUST SAY I WAS AT THE MALL I BOUGHT A HAMSTER 
IT'S NO GOOD BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH STORY THERE 
TO MAKE OUR STORY INTERESTING WE HAVE TO BE MORE DESCRIPTIVE 
WHICH MALL WHAT TYPE OF HAMSTER WHEN THINGS LIKE THAT 
IN MUSIC TO BETTER DESCRIBE THE THEMES WE STRETCH AND PLAY WITH THEM ON DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS 
CHANGE THEM BUT MAKE SURE THEY RETAIN THEIR ORIGINAL CHARACTER 
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW WE DO THIS WITH THAT FIRST THEME HERE IT IS AGAIN 
LET'S LISTEN TO THE VIOLINS IN THE LAST TWO BARS 
DID YOU ALL HEAR THIS MOTION UP AND THEN DOWN 
YES HERE'S A WAY TO STRETCH THE FIRST THEME BY USING THAT UP DOWN MOTION 
BUT NOT ON THE VIOLIN THAT WOULD BE TOO OBVIOUS NOW IT'S ON THE FLUTE OBOE AND BASSOON 
NOW WE KNOW MORE ABOUT OUR FIRST THEME WE CAN TRAVEL TO THE SECOND THEME UP HERE 
BUT HERE'S AN IMPORTANT POINT IT'S IN A KEY FIVE STEPS ABOVE THE KEY OF THE FIRST THEME 
IT'S HARDER TO EXPLAIN KEYS THAN TO HEAR THEM IF I SING QUITE POORLY 
AMAZING GRACE 
THEN I SING HIGHER KEY AMAZING GRACE 
I WENT INTO TWO KEYS THE MELODY WAS THE SAME BUT IT WAS IN A DIFFERENT KEY 
SO HERE'S THE KEY OF OUR FIRST THEME 
PA PA D. A. PA PA POM 
THEN WE JOURNEY UP FIVE STEPS LIKE THIS 
UP HERE NOW HERE'S OUR SECOND THEME AGAIN 
NOW LET'S LISTEN TO THE STATEMENT SECTION OUR TWO THEMES THEIR LITTLE CHANGES IN CHARACTER 
RAISE YOUR HANDS WHEN YOU THINK WE'VE GOT TO THE SECOND THEME A QUIZ FOR YOU ALL 
YOU GOT THAT PERFECT THAT WAS THE STATEMENT SECTION OF THE SONATA FORM 
BUT SOMETHING IS STILL MISSING THE HOW HOW DO WE GET FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER 
IT'S CALLED TRANSITION 
LET'S GO BACK TO OUR STORY ABOUT THE MALL AND THE HAMSTER 
TO MAKE THE STORY INTERESTING WE'D SAY MORE LIKE I WAS AT THE MALL 
TOOK THE ESCALATOR AND WALKED INTO JONES'S PET SHOP 
I SAW THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PUPPY IN THE WORLD BUT ONLY HAD ENOUGH MONEY FOR A STUPID HAMSTER 
HOW WE TRAVEL FROM ONE PLACE TO THE NEXT ON THE ESCALATOR OR WALKING MAKES OUR STORY CLEARER 
BUT IN CLASSICAL MUSIC OFTEN THE TRANSITIONS ARE JUST CONFUSING 
AS THE TRANSITION SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GOING FROM SOMEWHERE TO SOME OTHER WHERE HERE'S A SHORT TRANSITION 
NOW THAT WAS A RELATIVELY SHORT TRANSITION WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE 
THAT'S EVEN SHORTER HERE'S A LONG TRANSITION 
THIS IS MORE DIFFICULT TO REMEMBER THAN THOSE TWO IMPORTANT THEMES 
BUT TRANSITIONS ALLOW US TO TRAVEL SMOOTHLY FROM THEME TO THEME 
I ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT INTRODUCTIONS AND ENDINGS BUT THESE ARE OBVIOUS 
THIS STATEMENT SECTION IS INTRODUCED WITH A LITTLE FLOURISH LIKE CALLING SOMEBODY SIR OR MISTER 
THEN IT ENDS UP HERE IN THAT KEY FIVE STEPS ABOVE THE ORIGINAL KEY 
SO NOW LET'S SEE IF WE CAN HEAR THEME NUMBER ONE 
TRANSITIONS 
AND THEN I WANT YOU ALL TO SHOW ME BY RAISING YOUR HAND WHEN WE REACH THEME NUMBER TWO 
AND THEN WE'LL HEAR THE ENDING OF THE STATEMENT SECTION OF SONATA FORM 
THE NEXT SECTION FANTASIA IS WHERE OUR TWO MUSICAL THEMES 
ARE TOSSED AND TURNED AND TWISTED INTO DIFFERENT SHAPES AND KEYS 
IT'S WHERE OUR MUSICAL JOURNEY HEATS UP IN HERE ALL THESE SQUIGGLY LINES 
THE CHANGES TAKE PLACE QUICKLY SO WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO FOLLOW THEM 
IF THIS WAS A SECTION OF OUR HAMSTER STORY THE FANTASIA WOULD DESCRIBE SOME TYPE OF DRAMATIC INTERACTION 
BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR HAMSTER MAYBE I OPENED THE CAGE TO LOOK AT MY HAMSTER AND SUDDENLY SHE ESCAPED 
I HAD TO CHASE HER ALL AROUND THAT BIG MALL IN HERE BUT FINALLY I CAUGHT HER DOWN HERE 
WHEN THE TWO THEMES HAVE BEEN EXPLORED TO THE COMPOSER'S SATISFACTION THE FANTASIA ENDS 
HERE ARE SOME OF THE WAYS PROKOFIEV PLAYS WITH THE THEMES IN THE FANTASIA SECTION 
HE BEGINS BY GIVING OUR FIRST THEME A NEW SOUND IN A MINOR KEY 
THAT SOUNDS ALMOST LIKE OUR FIRST THEME BUT THE FIRST THEME IS IN A MAJOR KEY 
LET'S PLAY THEM TOGETHER THEN YOU'LL HEAR THE DIFFERENCE 
SOUNDS LIKE THE BLUES 
HE THEN BOUNCES A VERSION OF THE FIRST THEME BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE FLUTE AND THE VIOLIN 
REMEMBER HOW DELICATE THE SECOND THEME SOUNDED POM POM PA DUM POM 
WELL IN THE FANTASIA SECTION IT HAS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CHARACTER 
WE'RE USED TO HEARING IT ON BEAT ONE ONE TWO THREE FOUR ONE TWO THREE FOUR ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
NOW HE PLACES THAT SAME THEME ON BEAT TWO CHECK OUT HOW THIS SOUNDS 
THEN THE WINDS AND THE MOST NOBLE TRUMPETS PLAY IT ON BEAT ONE WHILE THE VIOLINS PLAY IT ON BEAT TWO 
PLAYING WITH THE STATEMENT SECTION'S TWO THEMES IS THE ESSENCE OF THE FANTASIA 
IT'S LIKE CHASING THAT HAMSTER AROUND THE MALL FINALLY THE HAMSTER'S CAPTURED DOWN HERE 
AND IN MUSIC THE FANTASIA ENDS WHEN BOTH THEMES HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY EXPLORED LET'S HEAR THE ENDING 
NOW WE'LL HEAR THE ENTIRE FANTASIA SECTION 
NOTICE AGAIN HOW OUR THEMES ARE TWISTED AND TURNED AROUND 
BECAUSE IT RECALLS OUR FIRST TWO THEMES 
BUT HERE'S THE THING THE SECOND THEME IS NOW IN THE SAME KEY AS THE FIRST 
WE'VE RETURNED TO THE GROUND FLOOR OUR HOME WITH THE SECOND THEME 
IN OUR STORY THE HAMSTER'S NO LONGER UP IN JONES'S PET SHOP ON THE FIFTH FLOOR 
BUT AFTER WE'VE CHASED HER ALL AROUND THIS MALL SHE'S DOWN HERE ON THE GROUND FLOOR WITH US 
OUR MUSICAL JOURNEY HAS BROUGHT US FIVE STEPS DOWN INTO THE SAME KEY AS THE FIRST THEME 
THEN AN OBVIOUS THE END ENDING 
THIS IS THE FIRST MOVEMENT OF PROKOFIEV'S CLASSICAL SYMPHONY WITH THE THEMES PRESENTED AND DEVELOPED 
THROUGH THE STATEMENT FANTASIA AND RESTATEMENT OF THE SONATA FORM 
AGAIN I WANT YOU TO RAISE YOUR HANDS WHENEVER YOU HEAR THAT SECOND THEME ALL RIGHT 
I'VE GOT RHYTHM BY GEORGE GERSHWIN 
THAT WAS A GEORGE GERSWHIN SONG ENTITLED I'VE GOT RHYTHM 
IT'S A THIRTY TWO BAR SONG A BAR INDICATES THE WAY THE BEATS ARE DIVIDED 
FOR EXAMPLE ONE TWO THREE FOUR TWO TWO THREE FOUR THREE TWO THREE FOUR FOUR TWO THREE FOUR 
THESE THIRTY TWO BARS ARE DIVIDED INTO FOUR EQUAL SECTIONS OF EIGHT BARS 
EIGHT TIMES FOUR EQUALS THIRTY TWO NOW WE CALL THESE SECTIONS 
A A B. AND A BECAUSE THREE OF THE SECTIONS ARE THE SAME AND ONE IS DIFFERENT 
NOW LET'S COUNT AND LISTEN TO THE FIRST SECTION 
ONE TWO ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR TWO TWO THREE FOUR THREE TWO THREE FOUR FOUR TWO THREE FOUR 
FIVE TWO THREE FOUR SIX TWO THREE FOUR SEVEN TWO THREE FOUR EIGHT TWO THREE FOUR 
THIS REPEATS TO GIVE US THE SECOND EIGHT 
ONE TWO ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
NOW B. IS CALLED THE BRIDGE BECAUSE IT JOINS A SECTIONS 
IT ACTUALLY TAKES YOU BACK TO YOUR HOME THEME OR A 
BUT THE BRIDGE HAS A DIFFERENT SOUND BECAUSE IT GOES TO OTHER KEYS 
ONE TWO ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
THEN WE COME BACK HOME FOR THE LAST A SECTION 
ONE TWO UH UH UH UH 
I'VE GOT RHYTHM WAS SOON TO HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE PROKOFIEV PIECE WE HEARD 
BUT THIS A A B. A FORM IS REALLY THE STATEMENT SECTION TWO AS 
FANTASIA WHICH IS THE BRIDGE OR B. 
AND RESTATEMENT WHICH IS THE STATEMENT OF THE A AGAIN 
YOU SEE IT'S THE SONATA FORM IN MINIATURE 
EXCEPT THIS FORM IS A LOT EASIER TO HEAR BECAUSE ONE IT'S SHORT TWO IT CAN BE COUNTED 
AND THREE THREE OF THE SECTIONS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME 
LET'S HEAR I'VE GOT RHYTHM ONCE MORE AND RAISE YOUR HANDS WHEN WE GET TO THE BRIDGE 
ONE TWO ONE UH UH UH 
REMEMBER WE'RE LEARNING HOW TO HEAR FORM 
WE SAID EARLIER THAT IN JAZZ MUSICAL IDEAS KEEP CHANGING OR DEVELOPING 
JAZZ MUSICIANS DEVELOP MUSICAL IDEAS USING A CHORUS FORMAT 
WHEN WE HEAR THE WORD CHORUS 
WE THINK IT MEANS A GROUP OF PEOPLE SINGING BUT A CHORUS IS ALSO THE DURATION OF A SONG 
ONE CHORUS OF I'VE GOT RHYTHM IS THIRTY TWO BARS LONG 
THE CHORUS FUNCTIONS IN MUSIC LIKE THE FLOOR IN A SKYSCRAPER 
THAT MEANS THAT A COMPOSITION IS CONSTRUCTED LIKE A SKYSCRAPER 
EACH FLOOR TAKES UP THE SAME SPACE AND ONE IS STACKED ON TOP OF ANOTHER 
AND ANOTHER AND SO ON UNTIL YOU FINISH 
THEN YOU CAN PUT A THING LIKE THIS ON TOP OR JUST CUT IT OFF 
EACH CHORUS IS THIRTY TWO BARS LONG AND ONE CHORUS FOLLOWS ANOTHER OF EQUAL LENGTH ETC TO FORM A COMPOSITION 
THE MUSICIANS STACK CHORUSES UNTIL THEY'RE READY TO STOP 
WE HAVE ONE OF THESE MOVABLE SKYSCRAPERS THAT THEY DEVELOPED IN SAN FRANCISCO 
THEY SHIFT THEM AROUND IN CASE OF AN EARTHQUAKE THIS ONE MOVES ALL AROUND IN CASE OF A SERIOUS CATASTROPHE 
NOW HOW YOU DIVIDE THE SPACE HELPS YOU DISTINGUISH WHAT GOES ON IN THE SKYSCRAPER 
ON THE FIFTH FLOOR IS A LAWYER'S OFFICE THE BOOKS ON THE GROUND HAVEN'T BEEN OPENED 
THAT'S WHY HE HASN'T HAD ANY BUSINESS 
ON THE FOURTH FLOOR IS A BEAUTY PARLOUR SOME OLD FASHIONED COMBS PEOPLE WITH CURLERS 
AND A LITTLE TOWEL OR SOMETHING TO WASH THE SHAMPOO OUT OF YOUR FACE 
THAT'S HOW THE SKYSCRAPER WORKS THE FLOORS ARE DIVIDED AND ORGANISED 
SO THAT WHEN YOU GET OFF ON ONE WHAT GOES ON TELLS YOU WHAT THAT FLOOR IS 
IN MUSIC IF WE HAVE A NINE CHORUS SONG CHORUS TWO MIGHT BE CALLED A SAX SOLO CHORUS 
LIKE THIS UH UH UH UH UH UH 
WHEREAS CHORUS FOUR MIGHT BE AN ENSEMBLE CHORUS 
AN ENSEMBLE MEANS THE ENTIRE GROUP 
THIS IS CHORUS FOUR ONE UH UH 
THIS IS A DUKE ELLINGTON COMPOSITION ENTITLED COTTONTAIL 
IT USES THE SAME FORM AS I'VE GOT RHYTHM 
LET'S LISTEN FOR THE THIRTY TWO BAR A A B. A SONG FORM 
THE BRIDGE AND THE CHORUS FORMAT 
HERE WE GO 
UH UH UH UH UH UH 
TENOR SAXOPHONE SOLO 
THIS IS A BULL 
THAT'S RIGHT A BULL SO ARE ALL OF THESE 
THE FIRST BULL IS THE THEME 
AND ALL OF THESE ARE VARIATIONS 
WHICH MEANS VARIED OR SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT 
EACH TIME THE BULL IS CHANGED BUT ITS BASIC FORM REMAINS THE SAME 
IN MUSIC WE CALL THIS 
LIKE CHANGING THE OUTER APPEARANCE OF THIS HAT 
WITHOUT CHANGING THE SHAPE FOR EXAMPLE HERE'S OUR THEME 
IT'S ONE WE ALL RECOGNISE MY COUNTRY TIS OF THEE 
WE COULD GIVE IT SOME FANCY FLOWERY EMBROIDERY 
BY HAVING THE FLUTES AND THE PICCOLOS TICKLING ON THOSE KEYS 
PLAYING FANCY HIGH NOTES 
IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS HAT WITH A LOT OF ACTIVITY AND COLOUR 
OR WE CAN MAKE IT A DISSONANT HAT 
BY PLAYING THE THEME IN DIFFERENT KEYS AT ALMOST THE SAME TIME 
HERE'S ONE VARIATION 
AND NOW THE OTHER 
NOW WE MASH THEM TOGETHER AND TWIST IT A LITTLE BIT 
AND THIS IS HOW IT SOUNDS 
WE CAN MAKE IT A BULLFIGHTING HAT 
BY CHANGING THE GROUND RHYTHM AND ADDING CASTANETS 
LET'S LISTEN TO THIS EXAMPLE OF THEME AND VARIATIONS 
CHARLES IVES' VARIATIONS ON AMERICA ORCHESTRATED BY WILLIAM SCHUMAN 
NOW WE'LL LEARN ABOUT THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL FORM IN AMERICAN MUSIC 
WE'VE ALL HEARD IT BUT PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THE BLUES 
I WANT YOU TO COUNT WITH THIS FORM THE BLUES CAN BE COUNTED 
WE ONLY HAVE TO COUNT TWELVE BARS HERE WE GO 
ONE TWO A ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
FOUR 
FIVE SIX SEVEN 
EIGHT NINE 
TEN 
ELEVEN TWELVE 
TWELVE IS A NATURAL NUMBER FOR THE BLUES 
AFTER ALL WE HAVE TWELVE MONTHS IN A YEAR TWELVE EGGS IN A DOZEN 
AND TWELVE INCHES IN A FOOT 
LET'S GET A RULER AND SEE WHAT THE BLUES LOOKS LIKE 
THESE ROMAN NUMERALS RIGHT HERE REPRESENT HARMONIES 
HARMONIES ARE GROUPS OF NOTES SOUNDING TOGETHER 
THEY ARE ALSO CALLED CHORDS THE BLUES HAS ONLY THREE CHORDS 
THE ONE THE FOUR AND THE FIVE 
WHITE BLUE AND RED 
THE TWELVE BARS OF THE BLUES DIVIDE INTO THREE SECTIONS OF FOUR BARS EACH 
LET'S SING THE ROOT NOTE OF THE CHORD FIRST WE HAVE THE ONE CHORD 
THEN FOUR STEPS UP TO FOUR 
NOW DOWN TO ONE 
NOW UP TO FIVE 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE 
AND DOWN AGAIN TO ONE 
LET'S SEE HOW THESE CHORDS FIT 
THE FIRST SECTION HAS FOUR BARS AND ONLY ONE CHORD 
TWO BARS OF THE FOUR CHORD AND TWO BARS OF THE ONE CHORD 
THE THIRD SECTION HAS FOUR BARS BUT THREE CHORDS 
ONE BAR OF THE FIVE ONE BAR OF THE FOUR AND TWO BARS OF THE ONE 
SO IN EACH SECTION WE ADD A CHORD TO THE FRONT OF THE ONE CHORD 
SO ONE FOUR AND THEN ONE THEN FIVE FOUR AND THEN ONE 
LET'S SING THE ROOT NOTES OF THE BLUES WITH ALL THREE SECTIONS 
LET'S SEE HOW THAT SOUNDS 
ONE TWO A ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
WE SAID THE CHORUSES ARE STACKED LIKE THE FLOORS OF THE SKYSCRAPER 
THE END OF ONE IS THE BEGINNING OF ANOTHER SEVEN EIGHT AND NINE 
EACH CHORUS CAN BE GIVEN A NAME TO DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENS 
WE HEARD ABOUT THE SOLO SAXAPHONE CHORUS AND THE ENSEMBLE CHORUS 
LET'S LEARN TWO MORE TYPES 
THE CALL AND RESPONSE CHORUS THIS IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE 
THE PIANO AND DRUMS ARE GOING TO CALL AND THE BASS WILL RESPOND 
ONE TWO A ONE TWO THREE 
AND WE HAVE A RIFF CHORUS 
A RIFF IS JUST THE SAME THING REPEATED THROUGH THE TWELVE BARS 
AH AH A HA AH AH 
THIS IS DUKE ELLINGTON'S HAPPY GO LUCKY LOCAL 
NOTICE HOW THE MUSICIANS PLAY THROUGH THE TWELVE BAR BLUES FORM 
IT'S ABOUT A TRAIN RAMBLING THROUGH THE SOUTH 
FIRST I'LL REMIND YOU OF THE OTHER FORMS WE LEARNED ABOUT 
THE THIRTY TWO BAR SONG FORM ALSO CALLED AABA 
THE CHORUS FORMAT THEME AND VARIATIONS 
WE LEARNED THE TWELVE BAR BLUES THE SONATA FORMS 
STATEMENT FANTASIA AND RESTATEMENT 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO ENJOY THE MUSIC 
GO TO A CONCERT TRY TO FOLLOW THE FORM 
TRY TO REMEMBER AND RECOGNISE THOSE THEMES 
IF YOU CAN'T DO ANY OF THAT WE STILL WANT YOU ALL TO HAVE A GOOD TIME 
THIS IS THE DUKE ELLINGTON HAPPY GO LUCKY LOCAL 
AH AH A HA AH AH
