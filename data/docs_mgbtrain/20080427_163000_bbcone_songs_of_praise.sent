OVER MY HEAD 
I HEAR MUSIC IN THE AIR 
OVER MY HEAD 
SPIRITUALS FOR ME ARE THE MOST INSPIRING SONGS OF PRAISE 
THEY ARE NOT JUST ABOUT SUFFERING AND PAIN AND ADVERSITY 
BUT ACTUALLY ABOUT JOY ABOUT GOD'S ACTION IN THE WORLD 
OVER MY HEAD 
IT WASN'T LIKE I'VE GOT TOO MANY PROBLEMS AND I CAN'T SING 
THE ISSUE WAS I'VE GOT SO MANY PROBLEMS I MUST SING 
THEY SANG THEMSELVES FROM VICTIMS TO VICTORY 
THEY SANG THEMSELVES OUT OF SLAVERY BASICALLY 
MUST BE A GOD SOMEWHERE 
I'M TOUCHED BY SPIRITUALS BECAUSE MY LIFE IS SOMETIMES UP SOMETIMES DOWN 
THROUGH SINGING THESE SONGS IT HELPS ME TO CONNECT TO SOMETHING DEEPER 
AND DIRECT MY THOUGHTS HEAVENWARD 
THERE MUST BE A GOD SOMEWHERE 
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED SINGING SPIRITUALS EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL 
SINGING IN MY GRANDFATHER'S CHURCH 
SO THIS IS IT THIS IS WHERE WE USED TO COME TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY 
MY GRANDFATHER WOULD BE OVER THERE MINISTERING AND THE CONGREGATION WOULD BE HERE 
ONE SUNDAY MY GRANDMOTHER SAID TO ME I WANT YOU TO LEARN A SONG 
SO I LEARNT GOD WILL OPEN DOORS AND THEN I SANG IT THAT SUNDAY 
I WALKED THROUGH THE CONGREGATION I WAS SO NERVOUS AND THEN I TURNED AROUND TO SING 
I WAS SHAKING LIKE A LEAF 
AFTER THE SECOND LINE OF THE SONG I FELT TOTALLY ELEVATED AND I FELT THE BEST FEELING I'D EVER FELT 
IT'S NEVER LEFT ME EVEN NOW AS A PROFESSIONAL SINGER I HAVE THAT FEELING 
TODAY ON SONGS OF PRAISE I'M GOING TO EXPLORE THE STORY OF AFRICAN AMERICAN SPIRITUALS 
BY MEETING PEOPLE WHO LIKE ME REGARD THESE SONGS AS HAVING SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE 
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR SOME OF THE BEST PERFORMED BY SIR WILLARD WHITE 
AND THE ADVENTIST VOCAL ENSEMBLE IN THE BEAUTIFUL SETTING OF CHRISTCHURCH SPITALFIELDS 
EVERY TIME I HEAR THE SPIRIT 
MOVING IN MY HEART 
I WILL PRAY I WILL PRAY 
I WILL PRAY 
FROM THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY ONWARDS 
MILLIONS OF AFRICANS WERE FORCIBLY TRANSPORTED ACROSS THE ATLANTIC TO THE AMERICAS 
THOSE THAT SURVIVED THE VOYAGE WERE REGARDED AS MERE COMMODITIES 
TO BE BOUGHT AND SOLD WITHOUT ANY RIGHTS OF THEIR OWN 
THEY WERE NOT PERMITTED TO PRACTISE THEIR OWN NATIVE RELIGIONS FROM AFRICA 
THEY WERE NOT EVEN PERMITTED TO SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGES 
SO THE ISSUE EMERGED AS TO HOW WERE THE SLAVES 
GOING TO FIND MEANING IN A WORLD 
THAT DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THEM AS HUMAN BEINGS 
ENSLAVED AFRICANS FOUND A MEANING FOR LIFE BY EMBRACING THE FAITH OF THEIR OPPRESSORS CHRISTIANITY 
IN FACT THEY NOT ONLY EMBRACED IT THEY MADE IT THEIR OWN 
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS READ THE BIBLE 
YOU READ IT AND IT TALKS ABOUT FREEDOM AND DIGNITY 
AND IT TALKS ABOUT LOVE AND JUSTICE 
SLAVES HEARD THAT 
HIDDEN WITHIN THE LANGUAGE OF CONVENTIONAL RELIGION THERE IS ALWAYS THAT 
ABSOLUTELY NON NEGOTIABLE UNCHANGING 
REVELATION THAT GOD TAKES EVERY HUMAN BEING SERIOUSLY 
A CHRISTIAN SLAVE IN THE PLANTATIONS IN THE OLD SOUTH MAY HAVE LOOKED AT A CHRISTIAN SLAVE OWNER 
AND WONDERED HOW THE SLAVE OWNER COULD SAY THE SAME WORDS READ THE SAME BIBLE 
BUT IT DIDN'T MEAN THE SLAVE REJECTED THAT RELIGION 
THE SLAVE THOUGHT THE SLAVE OWNER DOESN'T UNDERSTAND AND I DO 
DEEP RIVER 
MY HOME IS OVER JORDAN 
DEEP RIVER LORD 
I WANT TO CROSS OVER INTO CAMP GROUND 
OH DON'T YOU WANT TO GO 
TO THAT GOSPEL FEAST 
THAT PROMISED LAND 
WHERE ALL IS PEACE 
O. DEEP RIVER 
MY HOME IS OVER JORDAN 
DEEP RIVER LORD 
I WANT TO CROSS OVER INTO CAMP GROUND 
I WANT TO CROSS OVER INTO CAMP GROUND 
KEN BURTON IS THE CONDUCTOR OF SEVERAL CHOIRS 
INCLUDING A FORMER CHOIR OF THE YEAR THE LONDON ADVENTIST CHORALE 
HE'S ONE OF THIS COUNTRY'S LEADING EXPONENTS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN SPIRITUALS 
I'VE BROUGHT YOU HERE BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO SHOW ME THE MUSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SPIRITUALS 
THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS TO CONSTRUCT A SPIRITUAL FROM SCRATCH 
ALMOST LIKE A SPIRITUAL COOKERY CLASS 
FIRST WE NEED LYRICS MANY SPIRITUALS ARE BASED ON THE THEME OF WATER 
I'M GOING TO MAKE A LINE JORDAN RIVER IS DEEP AND WIDE I WANT TO CROSS OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE 
RIGHT THAT'S GOOD SECONDLY WE NEED A MELODY 
MOST SPIRITUALS ARE BASED ON FIVE NOTES A PENTATONIC SCALE 
FOUND ON THE BLACK KEYS OF THE PIANO 
WANT TO KNOW HOW TO PLAY A SPIRITUAL STICK TO THE AFRICAN KEYS 
AND THEN WITH THE MELODY WE'RE GOING TO PUT SOME SYNCOPATION SYNCOPATED RHYTHM INTO THAT 
IT'S VERY TYPICAL OF AFRICAN MUSIC 
WHAT WE HAVE THUS FAR IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
JORDAN RIVER IS DEEP AND WIDE 
NOW THIS IS KNOWN AS THE CALL THE FIRST PART OF THE SPIRITUAL 
IT'S IN TWO PARTS AND FOR EACH CALL WE NEED A RESPONSE 
WHICH IS SUNG IN HARMONY SO WE'RE GONNA USE THE WORDS O. MY LORD 
O. MY LORD SO WE'LL PUT IT ALL TOGETHER NOW 
THE MELODY THE LYRICS SYNCOPATION THE HARMONY RESPONSE 
AND BIND IT TOGETHER WITH A GOOD DOSE OF SOUL 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN ME YES BUT I'M WAITING FOR THE CALL 
JORDAN RIVER IS DEEP AND WIDE 
O. MY LORD 
AND I WANNA CROSS OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE 
O. MY LORD YOU CALL 
I'M WAITING FOR JESUS TO TAKE ME HOME 
O. MY LORD 
TAKE ME TO THE PROMISED LAND 
O. MY LORD 
WE OUGHT TO DO A SINGLE THAT'S GOOD 
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE ISN'T IT 
IT IS PRETTY SIMPLE THE STRUCTURE OF THESE SONGS PEOPLE WOULD SING THESE FOR HOURS ON END AS THEY WORKED 
AND THIS WOULD BE A MEANS OF THEM EXPRESSING AND COMMUNICATING THEIR DEEPEST FEELINGS 
AND COMMUNICATING TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO TALK WHILE THEY WERE WORKING 
STEAL AWAY STEAL AWAY 
STEAL AWAY TO JESUS 
STEAL AWAY STEAL AWAY HOME 
I AIN'T GOT LONG TO STAY HERE 
MY LORD HE CALLS ME 
HE CALLS ME BY THE THUNDER 
THE TRUMPET SOUNDS THE TRUMPET SOUNDS 
WITHIN MY SOUL IN MY SOUL 
I AIN'T GOT LONG TO STAY HERE 
STEAL AWAY OH STEAL AWAY 
OH STEAL AWAY TO JESUS 
STEAL AWAY STEAL AWAY HOME 
I AIN'T GOT LONG TO STAY HERE 
I AIN'T GOT LONG TO STAY HERE 
THE PARTICULAR FORM OF CHRISTIANITY THAT GREW UP DURING SLAVERY 
TOOK ON MANY OF THE THEMES 
MANY OF THE VALUES 
MANY OF THE OUTWARD MANIFESTATIONS OF AFRICAN RELIGION 
FOR THE AFRICAN YOU CANNOT BE RELIGIOUS 
UNLESS YOU CAN EXPRESS IT ENTHUSIASTICALLY IN MOVEMENT 
IN DANCE IN RHYTHM 
ONE CANNOT BE A RELIGIOUS PERSON 
UNLESS ONE SEEKS TO TAP INTO THE SPIRITUAL POWERS OF GOD 
IN THE CHRISTIAN CONTEXT THAT'S THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT 
THEY EMBRACED THE GOSPEL BECAUSE IT MADE SENSE TO THEM 
IT MADE SPIRITUAL SENSE TO THEM 
THIS IS WONDERFUL I'VE GOT A SAVIOUR I WANT TO EXPRESS MY FAITH 
I'VE GOT TO DO IT THE WAY I UNDERSTAND TO DO IT 
WITH THAT EXUBERANCE THEY SOUGHT THE UNDERGROUND CHURCH THE INVISIBLE CHURCH 
THEY WERE NOT HERETICS 
BUT THEY HAD TO FIND AN EXPRESSION FOR THEIR FAITH 
THEY DREW ON THE OLD TESTAMENT STORIES SO FOR EXAMPLE 
THE STORY OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL 
BEING TAKEN OUT OF EGYPT WHICH IS BONDAGE TO THE PROMISED LAND 
THEY IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES IN THAT STORY 
THAT WASN'T JUST AN ODD STORY THAT WASN'T MYTH 
THAT WAS REAL BECAUSE THAT WAS THEIR EXPERIENCE 
THEY WERE LIVING IT AND IN THE LIVING IT 
THEY SAW GOD AS A LIBERATOR AND THEY HAD EVERY HOPE IN HIM 
HE WAS GOING TO TAKE THEM THROUGH THE PROMISED LAND WHEREVER THAT LAND WAS GOING TO BE 
WHEN ISRAEL WAS 
IN EGYPT LAND 
LET MY PEOPLE GO 
OPPRESSED SO HARD THEY COULD NOT STAND 
LET MY PEOPLE GO 
GO DOWN MOSES 
WAY DOWN IN EGYPT LAND 
TELL OL' PHARAOH 
TO LET MY PEOPLE GO 
THE LORD TOLD MOSES WHAT TO DO 
LET MY PEOPLE GO 
BRING THE OPPRESSED CHILDREN THROUGH 
LET MY PEOPLE GO 
GO DOWN MOSES 
WAY DOWN IN EGYPT LAND 
TELL OL' PHARAOH 
TO LET MY PEOPLE GO 
WHEN THEY REACH THE OTHER SHORE 
LET MY PEOPLE GO 
THEY SANG A SONG OF TRIUMPH OH 
LET MY PEOPLE GO 
GO DOWN MOSES 
WAY DOWN IN EGYPT LAND 
TELL OL' PHARAOH 
TO LET MY PEOPLE GO 
LET MY PEOPLE GO 
LET MY PEOPLE GO 
LET 
MY PEOPLE 
GO 
IN THE FIELDS THERE WAS A REAL CODE 
IT WAS A COMMUNITY THEY WERE PICKING COTTON CHOPPING TOBACCO IN THE HOT SUN FROM SUNRISE TO SUNSET 
THEY PASSED THEIR MESSAGES ON BY SINGING THEM TO ONE ANOTHER 
IT COULD BE THAT SOMEONE WAS COMING THROUGH 
TO TAKE SOME SLAVES OUT TO ESCAPE OR THEY COULD GO INTO THE FIELD 
OR INTO THE BUSH WHAT WE CALL HUSH HARBOUR 
HAVE A SERVICE AND ALSO HAVE MEETINGS WHICH THEY DID AT THREAT OF THEIR LIVES 
BUT THEY WOULD SAY EVERY TIME I FEEL THE SPIRIT MOVING IN MY HEART I WILL PRAY 
TIME TO GO PRAY HAVE DISCUSSION LET'S GO PRAISE THE LORD 
THEY STAYED SCRIPTURAL BECAUSE THAT WAS THE COVER FOR IT 
BUT EVERYONE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT 
ROSE I KNOW WATER HAS A BIBLICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN SPIRITUALS 
BUT CAN IT HAVE A PRACTICAL PURPOSE AS WELL 
YES WITHOUT A DOUBT 
IF YOU THINK OF WADE IN THE WATER FOR EXAMPLE 
WHEN THEY SANG THAT SONG 
THEY WERE NOT JUST SAYING IT'S TIME TO GET IN THAT WATER 
THEY WERE ALSO ENCOURAGING THEIR FOLKS 
THE BLOODHOUNDS ARE GOING TO BE PICKING UP YOUR SCENT 
LET'S GET IN THE WATER GET THROUGH THE WATER 
TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE 
FANTASTIC REALLY 
THEIR SURVIVAL INSTINCT WAS JUST AMAZING 
WADE IN THE WATER 
WADE IN THE WATER CHILDREN 
WADE IN THE WATER 
GOD'S GONNA TROUBLE THE WATER 
WHO'S THAT MAN 
ALL DRESSED IN WHITE 
LOOKS LIKE THE LEADER OF THE ISRAELITES 
WHO'S THAT MAN 
ALL DRESSED IN RED 
LOOKS LIKE THE CHILDREN THAT MOSES LED 
WADE IN THE WATER 
WADE IN THE WATER CHILDREN 
WADE IN THE WATER 
GOD'S GONNA TROUBLE THE WATER 
JORDAN RIVER 
IS CHILLY AND COLD 
GOD'S GONNA TROUBLE THE WATER 
CHILLS THE BODY 
NOT THE SOUL 
GOD'S GONNA TROUBLE THE WATER 
WADE 
OH OH OH 
DON'T YOU KNOW 
GOD IS GONNA TROUBLE THE WATER 
HMMMMMMM YEAH 
WADE IN THE WATER 
WADE IN THE WATER CHILDREN 
WADE 
IN THE WATER 
GOD'S GONNA TROUBLE THE WATER 
GOD'S GONNA TROUBLE THE WATER 
GOD'S GONNA TROUBLE THE WATER 
OOOOOH OOOOOH OOOOOH 
OOOOOOOH OOOOOOOH 
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH 
THE LEGAL END OF SLAVERY IN THE UNITED STATES CAME 
WHEN PRESIDENT LINCOLN ISSUED THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY THREE 
HOWEVER THIS WASN'T THE END OF DISCRIMINATION 
AND SPIRITUALS HAVE CONTINUED TO INSPIRE MANY AFRICAN AMERICANS 
ESPECIALLY DURING THE STRUGGLE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND SIXTIES 
WE WERE FACED WITH ANOTHER SITUATION IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT 
WE'VE GOT EDUCATION BUT WE STILL CANNOT MOVE WE CANNOT GET ANYWHERE 
AIN'T GONNA LET NOBODY TURN ME LORD 
AND SO AGAIN THIS BEGAN TO STIR UP ANOTHER SONG OF THE HEART 
AND THE RESPONSE WAS VERY UNIQUE 
WHEN THEY WERE MARCHING SINGING THEIR SONGS MANY WERE SLAVE SONGS 
OH FREEDOM OH FREEDOM WE SHALL OVERCOME 
THOSE ARE ROOTING BACK TO THE SLAVE SONGS 
WE SHALL OVERCOME SOME DAY 
THEY WERE MAKING A STATEMENT ABOUT BEING TREATED 
WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT 
I CAN SEE WHY THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THOSE INVOLVED WITH IT 
LOOKED TO THE SPIRITUALS BECAUSE THE SPIRITUALS ENABLED THEM 
TO CONNECT WITH THE CENTRAL THEME OF LIBERATION 
THEY WANTED FREEDOM 
FREEDOM TO BE GOD'S PEOPLE GOD'S CHILDREN LIKE ANYONE ELSE 
I GOT A ROBE YOU GOT A ROBE 
ALL OF GOD'S CHILDREN GOT A ROBE 
WHEN I GET TO HEAVEN GONNA PUT ON MY ROBE 
AND GONNA SHOUT ALL OVER GOD'S HEAVEN 
HEAVEN HEAVEN 
EVERYBODY'S TALKING BOUT HEAVEN AIN'T GOING THERE 
HEAVEN HEAVEN I'M GONNA SHOUT ALL OVER GOD'S HEAVEN 
I GOT WINGS YOU GOT WINGS 
ALL O' GOD'S CHILDREN GOT WINGS 
WHEN I GET TO HEAVEN GONNA SPREAD OUT MY WINGS 
I'M GONNA FLY ALL OVER GOD'S HEAVEN 
HEAVEN HEAVEN HEAVEN 
EVERYBODY'S TALKING BOUT HEAVEN AIN'T GOING THERE 
HEAVEN HEAVEN I'M GONNA FLY ALL OVER GOD'S HEAVEN 
YOU KNOW I GOT SHOES YOU GOT SHOES 
ALL O' GOD'S CHILDREN GOT SHOES 
WHEN I GET TO HEAVEN GONNA PUT ON MY SHOES 
I'M GONNA WALK ALL OVER GOD'S HEAVEN 
HEAVEN HEAVEN 
EVERYBODY'S TALKING BOUT HEAVEN AIN'T GOING THERE 
HEAVEN HEAVEN 
I'M GONNA WALK ALL OVER GOD'S HEAVEN 
HEAVEN 
I'M GONNA WALK ALL OVER GOD'S HEAVEN 
I'M GONNA WALK ALL OVER I'M GONNA SHOUT ALL OVER 
I'M GONNA SING AND DANCE 
ALL OVER 
GOD'S 
HEAVEN 
NOBODY KNOWS 
MY JESUS 
SPIRITUALS STILL SPEAK TO A MODERN GENERATION 
FOR LOUANNE SAMPSON WHO SINGS WITH THE LONDON ADVENTIST CHORALE 
THEY HAVE A SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE 
I SUFFER FROM SYSTEMIC AND DISCOID LUPUS 
A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH JOINT AND MUSCLE PAIN 
IT ALSO AFFECTS YOUR SKIN 
AND IT'S VERY PAINFUL 
AND I THINK THAT IS THE JOY OF THE CHOIR AND THE SPIRITUALS 
BECAUSE IT TAKES YOUR MIND 
OFF EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU'RE SEEING HAPPENING TO YOU 
AND WHAT YOU'RE FEELING PHYSICALLY 
SO I AM REALLY GRATEFUL 
THAT I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THOSE TYPES OF SONGS 
AND THEY CAN HELP ME 
YOU CAN'T REALLY FORGET IT BECAUSE IT'S THERE BUT IT HELPS YOU TO COPE 
A LOT BETTER WITH WHAT YOU'RE FEELING WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH 
SOMETIMES I'M ALMOST 
TO THE GROUND 
YOU FEEL THAT YOU'RE IN THAT RIVER 
IN THAT SEA THAT YOU JUST DROWNING 
NOTHING IS GOING TO WORK OUT TODAY BUT UM 
THEN THE SONGS OF PEACE COME TO YOU THOSE SONGS OF HOPE 
AND YOU CAN RELATE TO THE STRUGGLES OTHERS HAVE HAD 
WHICH IS THE REASON WHY SPIRITUALS WERE WRITTEN 
UM AND YOU CAN FIND SOLACE AND HOPE 
TO HEAL THE SIN SICK SOUL 
TODAY FOR ME WHEN I SING THEM 
I FEEL A CONNECTION I REALLY DO FEEL A CONNECTION 
WITH MY PEOPLE THEY ARE MY PEOPLE 
AND I FEEL THEY GOT THROUGH SO MUCH 
THEY MAINTAINED THEIR DIGNITY 
AND THEY DIDN'T LOSE THEIR HOPE AND TRUST IN GOD 
AND SO IT'S A LESSON FOR ME 
WELL ONE WOULD ASK 
IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WHAT RELEVANCE WOULD SPIRITUALS HAVE TO A THIRTY SOMETHING YEAR OLD GUY 
BUT THEY COVER EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE 
NOBODY KNOWS THE TROUBLE I SEE 
DO WE STILL HAVE TROUBLES OF COURSE WE DO SO THAT SONG IS RELEVANT 
THE SPIRITUALS TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT'S RELEVANT IN HUMAN LIFE TODAY 
THE REASON WHY I LOVE SPIRITUALS 
IS BECAUSE WHENEVER I GO THROUGH A PROBLEM AND I HEAR A SPIRITUAL 
I FEEL THAT EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT 
I CAN IMAGINE THE AFRICAN SLAVES FEELING EXACTLY THE SAME WAY 
IT DIDN'T MATTER HOW MUCH SUFFERING THEY HAD GONE THROUGH 
THEY KNEW GOD WOULD TAKE CARE OF THEM
