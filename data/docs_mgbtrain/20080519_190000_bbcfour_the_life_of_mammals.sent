ONE HUNDRED MILLION YEARS AGO FORESTS LIKE THESE WERE JUST DEVELOPING 
AND WERE DOMINATED BY DINOSAURS 
BUT AS THE GIANT REPTILES SLEPT 
TINY CREATURES WERE STIRRING 
THEY WERE THE EARLY MAMMALS 
DESPITE THIS HUMBLE BEGINNING THEIR DESCENDANTS WOULD ULTIMATELY TAKE OVER THE WHOLE WORLD 
YET THE RISE OF THIS GREAT DYNASTY WAS FOUNDED ON THE MOST SURPRISING DIET 
CREATURES VERY LIKE THOSE FIRST MAMMALS ARE STILL AROUND TODAY SHREWS 
THEY HUNTED INSECTS AT NIGHT 
WHEN MOST DINOSAURS WERE SLEEPING 
THEY WERE ABLE TO GENERATE HEAT IN THEIR TINY BODIES 
SO THAT THEY COULD STAY ACTIVE IN THE COLD NIGHT AIR 
BUT DOING THIS BURNS A LOT OF FOOD SO THEY HAD TO EAT ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY AS SHREWS STILL DO 
THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH FOOD FOR A SHREW 
RIVALS FIGHT OVER HUNTING RIGHTS WITH EXTRAORDINARY FEROCITY 
THIS LITTLE INSECT EATER HAS NOW STAKED HIS CLAIM TO THE FOOD IN THIS PART OF THE WOODLAND 
WHEN HE MEETS A FEMALE HE IS ALMOST AS AGGRESSIVE TOWARDS HER AS HE IS TOWARDS A RIVAL MALE 
AFTER TESTING ONE ANOTHER'S STRENGTH THE FEMALE ACCEPTS THE MALE AS A CONTESTANT AND AS A MATE 
TWO WEEKS LATER THE YOUNG ARE BORN 
THEIR MOTHER HAS NOURISHED THEM INSIDE HER WOMB SO THEY ARRIVE COMPARATIVELY WELL DEVELOPED 
CARING FOR THE YOUNG IS A CRUCIAL PART OF A MAMMALS' WINNING DESIGN 
SOMETHING FEW REPTILES DO 
A MOTHER SHREW WILL EVEN QUENCH HER BABIES' THIRST WITH HER OWN SALIVA IF NECESSARY 
MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL 
SHE PROVIDES THEM WITH THAT UNIQUELY MAMMALIAN FOOD MILK 
THIS MILK IS SO RICH THAT IT TAKES JUST TWO WEEKS FOR THE YOUNG TO APPROACH THEIR MOTHER IN SIZE 
BY THIS TIME THEY ARE QUITE A HANDFUL AND NEED TO BE WEANED FROM THE NIPPLE DESPITE THEIR PROTESTS 
THEIR MUM DOESN'T ABANDON THEM SHE LEADS THEM INTO THE WORLD OUTSIDE 
AND THE YOUNG HAVE THEIR OWN PARTICULAR WAY OF ENSURING THAT THEY DON'T GET LOST 
THE FIRST MAMMALS LIVED ALONGSIDE THE DINOSAURS FOR A VERY LONG TIME 
BUT THEN ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILLION YEARS AGO WHEN THE DINOSAURS SO SUDDENLY AND DRAMATICALLY DISAPPEARED 
THEY HAD THEIR CHANCE TO COLONISE NEW ENVIRONMENTS 
AT FIRST THEY REMAINED MUCH THE SAME SMALL SCURRYING CREATURES 
BUT THAT IS A VERSATILE BODY PATTERN AND ONE OF THEM WITHOUT MUCH CHANGE TOOK TO THE WATER 
IT HUNTS AS FRENETICALLY AS ITS COUSINS DO ON LAND BUT IT HAS A DIFFERENT WAY OF CATCHING INSECTS 
THE WATER SHREW'S FUR IS OILY AND SHEDS WATER WITH A SLIGHT FLICK 
ITS SPLENDID WHISKERS ARE LONG TO HELP IT FEEL FOR PREY UNDERWATER 
ITS ANKLES ARE HAIRY SO ITS FEET SERVE AS EXCELLENT PADDLES 
IT SHINES LIKE SILVER GLISTENING FROM THE BUBBLES TRAPPED WITHIN ITS FUR AS IT SEARCHES FOR PREY 
CLINGING TO A ROOT A DRAGONFLY LARVA 
BUT THE SHREW'S WHISKERS DON'T TOUCH IT AND IT'S MISSED 
BUT NOT THIS TIME 
IN AFRICA'S NAMIB DESERT ANOTHER INSECT HUNTER SWIMS AFTER PREY 
BUT WITHOUT A DROP OF WATER IN SIGHT 
IT'S A SAND SWIMMER 
A GOLDEN MOLE 
SAND UNLIKE WATER SCRATCHES AND IT ISN'T TRANSPARENT EITHER 
THE MOLE'S EYES ARE COVERED WITH SKIN ITS HEAD A WEDGE WITH WHICH IT FORCES ITS WAY THROUGH SAND 
AS IT DIGS 
SAND COLLAPSES BEHIND IT MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR A TUNNEL TO FORM 
SO IT DOESN'T DIG THROUGH THE SAND IT REALLY DOES SWIM 
SOUND TRAVELS WELL IN SAND UNLIKE SHREWS WHICH ARE ADAPTED TO HEAR HIGH PITCHED SOUND 
THIS MOLE DETECTS VERY LOW ONES 
LIKE THE FAINT VIBRATIONS MADE BY FORAGING TERMITES 
PROPELLED BY ITS FLIPPERS AND GUIDED BY SOUND THE MOLE HOMES IN 
ON ITS PREY 
IN NORTH AMERICA ANOTHER MOLE HAS PAWS THAT LOOK LIKE FLIPPERS 
THESE HELP IT TO SWIM UNDER ICE 
TO COLLECT INSECTS BUT THIS IS NOT THEIR PRIMARY PURPOSE 
THIS CREATURE IS A DIGGER A STAR NOSED MOLE 
ITS PAWS ARE SPADES FOR PUSHING ASIDE SOIL 
WHILE IT TRIES TO LOCATE ITS PREY WITH ITS ASTONISHING NOSE 
THIS HAS TWENTY TWO FLESHY ARMS 
EACH IS SO PACKED WITH NERVE ENDINGS 
THAT THE MOLE COULD TOUCH A PINHEAD WITH ITS NOSE IN SIX HUNDRED PLACES AT ONCE 
ALLOWING IT TO LOCATE THE TINIEST OF PREY 
LIVING IN SOIL RATHER THAN SAND 
THIS MOLE CAN DIG PROPER TUNNELS 
IT CONSTRUCTS A LABYRINTH OF PASSAGES 
AND PATROLS THEM TO COLLECT ANY PREY THAT DROPS INTO THEM 
THE STAR NOSE UNDERGROUND IS LARGELY BEYOND THE REACH OF PREDATORS 
OTHER INSECT HUNTERS HOWEVER 
RUN ALONG TRAILS ABOVE GROUND AND THEY ARE NOT SO LUCKY 
AND ONE OF THESE TRAIL RUNNERS LIVES HERE IN THE SCRUBLANDS OF EAST AFRICA 
THIS TINY PATHWAY THROUGH THE WITHERED GRASS 
SHOWS THE INSECT HUNTING RIGHTS FOR THIS AREA HAVE BEEN TAKEN 
TO ADVERTISE THE FACT THE OWNER HAS LEFT A LITTLE PILE OF ITS DUNG 
BUT WHAT COULD HAVE MADE IT 
WELL TO FIND OUT I CAN USE THIS TINY SURVEILLANCE CAMERA 
IF I PUT THAT THERE 
AND THEN JUST IN FRONT OF IT PUT SOME TWIGS ACROSS THE PATH 
THE CREATOR OF THESE RUNWAYS IS FASTIDIOUS AND WITH ANY LUCK 
IT WILL STOP TO CLEAR THE TWIGS 
AND THEN GIVE US A CHANCE TO HAVE A GOOD LOOK AT IT 
THIS IS THE PICTURE FROM THE CAMERA I'VE JUST PLACED 
AND THIS IS FROM ANOTHER CAMERA FARTHER UP THE SAME TRAIL 
AND NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS TO WAIT 
IT'S AN ELEPHANT SHREW 
HE'S NOT GOING TO LIKE THAT 
THERE YOU GO HE'S CLEARING HIS TRAIL 
OH 
OH DEAR 
I'M AFRAID I HAVE PUT IN TOO MUCH 
THE ELEPHANT SHREW OR SENGI KEEPS ITS TRAILS IMMACULATE FOR A VERY GOOD REASON 
IT SPRINTS TO EVADE ITS ENEMIES 
EVEN THE SMALLEST TWIG COULD CAUSE A STUMBLE THAT COULD BE DISASTROUS 
THE GOSHAWK HAS SUCH KEEN EYESIGHT THAT SPOTTING A SENGI IS NO PROBLEM 
CATCHING ONE IS ANOTHER MATTER 
THE SENGI HOLDS A MAP OF ITS TRAILS IN ITS MIND 
SO THAT IN EMERGENCIES IT CAN CUT CORNERS TO DIVE FOR COVER 
EVEN A BRUSH WITH DEATH DOESN'T PUT A SENGI OFF ITS FOOD 
LIKE ALL SMALL INSECT HUNTERS IT NEEDS TO CONSTANTLY FUEL ITS INTERNAL FIRES 
THAT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT WHEN THERE ARE YOUNG TO FEED 
INCREDIBLY THIS SENGI IS ONLY A FEW HOURS OLD 
FEW MAMMALS ARE BORN AS WELL DEVELOPED AS A BABY SENGI 
THIS GIVES THEM A SURVIVAL EDGE 
DAYTIME IN THE AFRICAN BUSH IS NO PLACE FOR THE HELPLESS SENGIS ARE BORN TO RUN 
ITS APPETITE FOR MILK IS UNQUENCHABLE 
GROWING AT THIS SPEED GIVES IT CONSTANT HUNGER 
ITS MOTHER HAS NIPPLES NEAR HER SHOULDERS WHICH MAKES THEM EASIER TO REACH AND HELPS A QUICK GET AWAY 
THE BABY WILL TAKE SOLID FOOD FROM ITS MOTHER ON ITS VERY FIRST DAY IF IT GETS A CHANCE 
WITH CONTINUED HELP FROM ITS MOTHER THE YOUNGSTER WILL BE ALMOST FULLY GROWN WITHIN A WEEK 
AND BE ABLE TO RUN AS FAST AS HER ALONG THEIR RACETRACKS 
CATCHING INSECTS ONE BY ONE TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND A LOT OF ENERGY 
AND VERY FEW CREATURES THAT FEED THAT WAY CAN GET ENOUGH TO BUILD AND SUSTAIN BIG BODIES 
BUT SOME INSECT EATERS ABOUT FORTY MILLION YEARS AGO 
SOLVED THAT PROBLEM BY BROADENING THEIR DIET 
AND ONE OF THEIR DESCENDANTS LIVES RIGHT HERE IN MY GARDEN IN LONDON 
AND I CAN TEMPT IT OUT WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF FOOD INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE MINCED MEAT 
THE HEDGEHOG IS A CREATURE OF THE NIGHT BUT IT'S TOO BIG TO HIDE IN THE LEAVES 
THAT MAKES IT VULNERABLE TO ATTACK FROM ANIMALS LIKE FOXES 
TO MAKE UP FOR THIS ITS HAIRS HAVE BECOME A CLOAK OF PRICKLES 
AND IF IT THINKS IT IS IN REAL DANGER IT'S GOT A SPECIAL TRICK 
THE HEDGEHOG WILL STAY AN IMPREGNABLE SPINY BALL LIKE THIS 
UNTIL IT DECIDES THAT DANGER IS PASSED 
BUT ONE THING IS GUARANTEED TO MAKE A MALE HEDGEHOG DROP HIS GUARD 
AN AMOROUS LIAISON 
IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE ON A SPRING EVENING 
YOU MAY BE LUCKY ENOUGH TO WITNESS AN EXTRAORDINARY SIGHT 
YOU MIGHT THINK THAT HAVING A COAT OF SPINES ON YOUR BACK 
WOULD BE SOMETHING OF A HANDICAP WHEN IT COMES TO THE INTIMACIES OF COURTSHIP 
CLASSICAL NATURALISTS THOUGHT THAT HEDGEHOGS ACTUALLY MATED 
BELLY TO BELLY 
THE MALE NOSES THE FEMALE'S SPINES WHICH SEEMS TO EXCITE HER 
ALTHOUGH AS FAR AS HE IS CONCERNED 
IT DOES LOOK RATHER PAINFUL 
WHETHER THE FEMALE FLATTENS HER PRICKLES TO HELP THE MALE IS UNCLEAR 
BUT IT DOES SEEM THAT THE OLD JOKE THAT ASKS HOW DO HEDGEHOGS MATE IS TRUE 
THE ANSWER IS OF COURSE WITH GREAT CARE 
THE EARLY AMERICAN INSECT EATERS ALSO NEEDED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES 
BUT THEY DID SO NOT WITH SPINES BUT WITH ARMOUR PLATING 
ARMADILLOS LIKE HEDGEHOGS GREW LARGE BY BROADENING THEIR DIET 
THEIR TASTES CHANGE WITH THE SEASONS 
FRUIT IS EASY TO COLLECT BUT THE NINE BANDED ARMADILLO IS NOT FUSSY 
AND WILL PICK UP ANYTHING THAT LOOKS EDIBLE 
IT STILL EATS INSECTS 
BUT ANTS PRESENT IT WITH A PROBLEM 
ITS ARMOUR PROTECTS IT FROM LARGE PREDATORS BUT IT ISN'T GOOD DEFENCE AGAINST SMALL PREY 
ONE EXTRAORDINARY AFRICAN INSECT HUNTER HAS NO SUCH TROUBLE 
IT'S A PANGOLIN ITS HORNY SCALES LIKE THE HEDGEHOG'S PRICKLES ARE MADE FROM MODIFIED HAIR 
ITS BIG FRONT CLAWS ARE USELESS FOR WALKING 
IT TRUNDLES ALONG ON ITS HIND LEGS 
BALANCING ITS TORSO WITH ITS TAIL 
ITS FRONT CLAWS ARE RESERVED FOR DIGGING UP ANTS 
AS IT DOES SO IT SWALLOWS STONES 
THEY ACCUMULATE IN ITS STOMACH AND HELP TO GRIND UP THE ANTS 
BUT THESE SMALL UNDERGROUND ANT COLONIES 
ARE MERE SNACKS TO A PANGOLIN 
THIS IS A REAL MEAL A FULL SIZE ANTS' NEST 
THERE ARE A MILLION OR SO OF THEM IN HERE 
THE PANGOLIN SMASHES THROUGH THE NEST WALL WITH FORMIDABLE POWER 
ONLY AN ADULT HAS THE STRENGTH TO DO THIS 
YOUNG ONES STAY WITH THEIR MOTHER FEEDING IN HER WAKE UNTIL THEY ARE BIG ENOUGH TO DIG FOR THEMSELVES 
THE ANGRY ANTS SWARM ALL OVER THEIR ATTACKER 
BUT THE PANGOLIN'S ARMOUR IS A VERY EFFECTIVE DEFENCE 
ITS EYES ARE PROTECTED BY THICK LIDS 
AND ITS NOSTRILS AND EARS HAVE SPECIAL VALVES TO KEEP THE BITING INSECTS OUT 
FOR ITS SIZE THE PANGOLIN HAS THE LONGEST TONGUE OF ANY MAMMAL 
AND THE STICKIEST SALIVA 
BUT MAMMALS DIDN'T ALWAYS HAVE ANT COLONIES TO FEED ON 
THE RISE OF SOCIAL INSECTS SIXTY MILLION YEARS AFTER MAMMALS ARRIVED WAS A LANDMARK IN EVOLUTION 
IT WAS THEN THAT TERMITES AND ANTS 
STARTED TO BUILD HUGE NESTS EACH CONTAINING MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS 
HERE WAS SO MUCH FOOD THAT INSECT EATERS COULD GROW BIG 
THERE ARE TERMITES IN THE AMERICAS 
JUST AS THERE ARE IN AFRICA 
SO OF COURSE THERE ARE TERMITE EATERS TOO 
AND HERE IN BRAZIL IS THE BIGGEST OF THEM ALL THE GIANT ANTEATER 
ITS EYESIGHT IS VERY POOR 
AND IT RELIES MOSTLY ON ITS SENSE OF SMELL WHICH IS VERY ACUTE 
BUT IF I KEEP DOWNWIND OF IT 
I MAY NOT DISTURB IT TOO MUCH 
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANTS AND TERMITES AREN'T VERY NUTRITIOUS 
SO THE GIANT ANTEATER HAS TO DO ALL IT CAN TO CONSERVE ENERGY 
AND ONE WAY OF DOING THAT IS TO SLEEP FOR FIFTEEN OUT OF TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
IT COVERS ITSELF TOO WITH THAT BIG BUSHY TAIL 
TO REDUCE HEAT LOSS TO A MINIMUM 
AND IT ALSO KEEPS ITS BODY AT AS LOW A TEMPERATURE AS ANY MAMMAL THIRTY TWO DEGREES 
THAT MEANS OF COURSE THAT ITS BRAIN DOES NOT WORK VERY FAST 
IT'S NOT AN ANIMAL WITH LIGHTNING REACTIONS OR DAZZLING INTELLIGENCE 
BUT THEN YOU DON'T REALLY NEED THAT IF YOU ARE AN ANTEATER AND NOW I THINK I WILL GET OUT OF ITS WAY 
TERMITE MOUNDS ARE MORE NUMEROUS HERE THAN ANYWHERE 
BUT THE CHALLENGES FACING A TERMITE EATER ARE CONSIDERABLE 
ANTEATERS AND PANGOLINS HAVE DIFFERENT ANCESTORS 
BUT THE DEMANDS OF THEIR DIET HAS SHAPED THEM IN SIMILAR WAYS 
BOTH HAVE BIG CLAWS THE GIANT'S ARE THE LARGEST OF ANY MAMMAL 
AND BOTH HAVE AN IMMENSELY LONG TONGUE THAT SLIPS THROUGH THE TUBE FORMED BY THE TOOTHLESS JAWS 
SO THAT BOTH CAN VIRTUALLY DRINK TERMITES 
HE MAY LACK TEETH BUT I AM GOING TO TREAT HIM WITH CAUTION 
BECAUSE IN FACT THOSE HUGE CLAWS AND THOSE POWERFUL FRONT LEGS CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS 
HE CAN RIP APART THIS TERMITE HILL 
AND IF HE WANTS TO DEFEND HIMSELF 
HE WILL USE THOSE BIG BOWED LEGS AND THEIR CLAWS AND GRIP YOU 
IT HAS EVEN BEEN SAID THAT THE CARCASS OF A JAGUAR WAS FOUND IN THE EMBRACE OF ONE OF THESE 
IT ONLY COLLECTED A FEW HUNDRED TERMITES ON THAT BRIEF VISIT 
AS SOON AS IT BREAKS INTO A MOUND THE INHABITANTS ATTACK IT SO FEROCIOUSLY THAT THEY DRIVE IT AWAY 
BUT QUICK SAMPLING LIKE THIS DOES HAVE AN ADVANTAGE 
THE TERMITES WILL SOON REPLACE THE ONES THEY HAVE LOST SO IN EFFECT THE ANTEATER IS HARVESTING 
THE TERMITE HILLS IN ITS TERRITORY 
TO ENSURE A CONTINUOUS SUPPLY 
IT MAY NOT HAVE A DAZZLING INTELLIGENCE 
BUT NOTHING EXPLOITS TERMITES MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN THE GIANT ANTEATER 
IF YOU WANT TO EXPLORE THE ORIGINS OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY ANIMAL 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO TO A VERY SURPRISING PLACE 
I'M NEAR MESSEL IN GERMANY 
BEHIND ME IS A QUARRY RICH IN THE FOSSILISED REMAINS OF ANIMALS THAT DIED FIFTY MILLION YEARS AGO 
AND THAT WAS A PIVOTAL TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE MAMMALS 
EVEN THOUGH THESE ANIMALS LIVED A VERY LONG TIME AGO SOME OF THEM LOOK REMARKABLY FAMILIAR 
THIS IS A TREE ANTEATER VERY LIKE THE TAMANDUA ANTEATER THAT LIVES IN SOUTH AMERICA TODAY 
ALL THE INSECT COLLECTING EQUIPMENT IS THERE 
HUGE CLAWS ON THE FRONT LEGS 
NO TEETH AND JAWS FUSED INTO A TUBE THROUGH WHICH A LONG TONGUE WOULD HAVE FLICKED 
AND ALONGSIDE THE ANTEATER THE FIRST KNOWN PANGOLIN 
ONCE MORE IT HAS HUGE CLAWS NO TEETH 
AND AGAIN IT LOOKS IDENTICAL TO ITS LIVING EQUIVALENT 
THE AFRICAN PANGOLIN OF TODAY 
WHY HAVE THESE ANIMALS REMAINED UNCHANGED FOR FIFTY MILLION YEARS 
THE ROCKS OF MESSEL PROVIDE AN ANSWER TO THAT 
FROM THEM HAS COME A TERMITE MORE IMPORTANTLY THE QUEEN OF A TERMITE COLONY 
IT'S THE SAME IN EVERY IMPORTANT RESPECT AS ITS LIVING RELATIVES 
AND THIS IS THE KEY 
IF TERMITES HAVEN'T CHANGED FOR FIFTY MILLION YEARS WHY CHANGE THE DESIGN OF THE TERMITE EATER 
EVEN BACK THEN THE MAJORITY OF INSECTS WERE AIRBORNE AND OUT OF REACH OF GROUND DWELLING MAMMALS 
BUT ONE MAMMAL FOLLOWED THE INSECTS INTO THE AIR 
AND FOSSILS OF IT HAVE ALSO BEEN FOUND IN THE MESSEL DEPOSITS 
IT'S A BAT 
THE ABILITY TO CATCH INSECTS ON THE WING IS AN EXTRAORDINARY ACHIEVEMENT HOW DO THE BATS DO IT 
THIS IS A GREAT PLACE FOR BATS THERE ARE MANY INSECTS FLYING AROUND 
JUST NOW BIRDS ARE FEEDING ON THEM AND BATS ARE ASLEEP IN THEIR ROOSTS 
BUT SOON IT WILL GET DARK 
AND THEN THE BIRDS WILL GO TO ROOST AND THE BATS WILL COME OUT TO CLAIM THEIR SHARE 
AT NIGHT THERE ARE EVEN MORE FLYING INSECTS THAN THERE WERE DURING THE DAY 
AND BY THE MILL STREAM IS A COLONY OF DAUBENTON'S BATS THAT ARE ALREADY STIRRING 
THEIR FACES ARE SO LIKE A SHREW'S 
THAT IT'S EASY TO IMAGINE SHREW LIKE ANCESTORS IN THE TREES JUMPING FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH 
CHASING INSECTS 
EVER LARGER FLAPS OF SKIN BETWEEN THEIR FINGERS EXTENDED THOSE JUMPS 
UNTIL EVENTUALLY THEY COULD FLY 
AND HOW THEY CAN FLY 
THE CHANGE FROM A SCURRYING ANIMAL LIKE A SHREW TO A FLUTTERING BAT 
IS SURELY THE MOST MAGICAL IN THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE MAMMALS 
THE BATS' MASTERY OF FLIGHT IS SO COMPLETE 
THAT FEW INSECTS CAN OUTMANOEUVRE THEM IN THE AIR 
THE BAT SCOOPS UP THE MOTH WITH THE MEMBRANE AROUND ITS TAIL 
AND PASSES IT FORWARD TO THE MOUTH 
THEIR GROUND LIVING ANCESTORS PROBABLY USED SOUND 
TO FIND THEIR WAY IN THE NIGHT AS SHREWS STILL DO 
BUT BATS PERFECTED THAT TECHNIQUE USING SOUND FREQUENCIES BEYOND OUR HEARING 
A BAT DETECTOR MAKES THOSE CALLS AUDIBLE TO US 
BATS EMIT HIGH INTENSITY PULSES OF SOUND AND THEN LISTEN TO THE ECHOES THAT BOUNCE BACK 
THEIR BRAINS PROCESS THESE REFLECTIONS 
TO GIVE THEM A THREE D. IMAGE OF THEIR SURROUNDINGS 
AND THEIR PREY 
MOTHS WITH THEIR LABORIOUS FLIGHT ARE RELATIVELY EASY TO CATCH 
BUT THEN SOME EVOLVED A DEFENCE 
A SIMPLE EAR SO THAT WHEN THEY HEAR THE SONAR OF A BAT APPROACHING THEY CAN SWERVE OUT OF THE WAY 
SO ONE BAT CHANGED TACTICS 
THE LONG EARED DOESN'T HUNT WITH SONAR 
IT USES ITS ENORMOUS EARS TO LISTEN FOR PREY 
IT CAN FILTER THE SOUND OF A MOTH'S WING BEATS 
THROUGH THE NOISE OF THE RUSHING WATER 
ITS SONAR GUIDES IT THROUGH THE BRANCHES 
BUT AS IT NEARS THE MOTH IT TURNS THAT OFF AND ENTERS STEALTH MODE 
NOW IT'S GUIDED SOLELY BY THE NOISE OF THE MOTH'S WING BEATS BUT THE SYSTEM ISN'T PERFECT 
THE BAT CAN HEAR THE MOTH THROUGH THE LEAF 
AND IS APPROACHING IT FROM THE WRONG SIDE 
A LUCKY ESCAPE FOR THE MOTH 
BUT NOW THE BAT HAS COME ROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE IF THE MOTH STAYS STILL 
IT MAKES NO NOISE SO THE BAT CAN'T LOCATE IT 
BUT SOONER OR LATER THE MOTH WILL HAVE TO MOVE 
AND THAT IS ITS UNDOING 
BUT HOW COULD A BAT CATCH PREY THAT IS SILENT IN A PLACE LIKE THIS SO CLUTTERED WITH VEGETATION 
THAT ECHOLOCATION SHOULDN'T WORK 
THESE PLACES ARE TRICKY TO NAVIGATE BUT FULL OF FOOD 
SPIDERS ARE MORE NUTRITIOUS THAN MOTHS BUT THEY'RE SILENT VENOMOUS 
AND CONSTRUCT WEBS SO STRONG THAT A BAT COULD EASILY BECOME ENTANGLED IN THE STICKY SILK 
HERE COMES NATTERER'S BAT 
IT SEEMS WELL AWARE OF THE ALMOST MICROSCOPICALLY THIN SILKEN THREADS 
AND WITH SURGICAL PRECISION REMOVES THE SPIDER FROM ITS WEB 
IT EVEN REVERSES AWAY FROM THE WEB TO AVOID GETTING ENTANGLED 
TO DETECT THE THREADS AND RECOGNISE ON WHICH SIDE THE SPIDER IS SITTING 
MUST BE THE ULTIMATE REFINEMENT OF SONAR 
MEXICAN FREE TAILED BATS 
THEY FORM SOME OF THE BIGGEST AND THE DENSEST ASSEMBLAGES OF MAMMALS TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET 
THERE ARE TWELVE MILLION IN THIS CAVE 
BUT WHERE DO SUCH A VAST NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS FIND FOOD WITHIN FLYING DISTANCE OF WHERE THEY ROOST 
THAT PUZZLE BAFFLED PEOPLE FOR A LONG TIME 
BUT NOW WE'RE BEGINNING TO DISCOVER WHAT THEY FEED ON AND WHERE THEY FIND IT AND IT'S VERY SURPRISING 
A FEW YEARS AGO PILOTS FLYING ABOVE TEXAS REPORTED SEEING BATS AT HIGH ALTITUDE 
SCIENTISTS INVESTIGATED AND MADE AN EXTRAORDINARY DISCOVERY 
AS I CLIMB INTO THE EVENING SKY THE WEATHER CONDITIONS SEEM GOOD 
BUT THE LOCAL WEATHER RADAR SHOWS A STORM NEARBY GROWING WITH ALARMING SPEED 
HOWEVER I NEEDN'T WORRY 
THIS IS NOT A STORM IT'S THE BATS WE JUST LEFT LEAVING THEIR ROOST 
THEY START FROM A NUMBER OF POINTS EACH THE MOUTH OF A DIFFERENT CAVE 
THE SWARMS ARE VAST WITH UP TO TWENTY MILLION BATS LEAVING ONE ENTRANCE 
SOME FLY LOW OVER TEXAS 
BUT CURIOUSLY MOST START TO CLIMB 
AT TEN THOUSAND FEET UP BATS ARE SO WIDELY DISPERSED 
THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THEM 
BUT I'VE GOT MY BAT DETECTOR 
AND THERE'S ONE AND WHAT IS MORE THAT IS A FEEDING BUZZ 
SO THEY'RE EATING SOMETHING THE QUESTION IS WHAT 
THEY'RE A KILOMETRE ABOVE THE GROUND AND MOST ARE STILL CLIMBING 
BUT NOW THE RADAR PICKS UP ANOTHER FRONT BLOWING IN FROM NEW MEXICO 
AND THE BATS ARE FLYING TOWARDS IT 
WHAT COULD ATTRACT THEM TO THESE GREAT HEIGHTS 
SCIENTISTS FIND OUT WHAT'S FLYING HIGH IN THE SKY AT NIGHT WITH A DEVICE LIKE THIS 
AND IN IT 
MOTHS 
VAST NUMBERS OF THESE INSECTS USE THE PREVAILING WINDS AT ALTITUDE 
TO TRAVEL FROM THE TROPICS TO FEED 
BATS CLIMB UP TO THREE KILOMETRES INTO THE NIGHT SKY TO CATCH THEM 
BATS ARE SO NUMEROUS AND SO VORACIOUS THAT THE INDIVIDUALS IN THIS ONE CAVE BELOW ME 
EAT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TONS OF INSECTS EVERY NIGHT 
SO IF BATS HAVE SUCH RAVENOUS APPETITES 
HOW DO THEY SURVIVE IN THE WINTER WHEN THERE ARE NO FLYING INSECTS 
IN TEXAS THEY MIGRATE 
HERE IN CANADA THEY HAVE A TRULY RADICAL SOLUTION 
OUTSIDE IT IS TWENTY DEGREES BELOW FREEZING 
INSIDE ICICLES HANG FROM THE CEILING 
AND YET THESE LITTLE BROWN BATS CAN SURVIVE 
THROUGHOUT THE WINTER WITHOUT A SINGLE MEAL 
HOW DO THEY DO IT 
THE THERMAL IMAGING CAMERA IS SHOWING MY FACE 
AS RED AND ORANGE 
THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S WARM I'M A MAMMAL 
PUTTING IT MORE PRECISELY I AM LOSING ENERGY AS HEAT 
BUT THESE LITTLE BATS ARE BLUE BECAUSE THEY ARE COLD 
AS COLD AS THE ROCK TO WHICH THEY ARE CLINGING 
AS THE BATS ARE NO LONGER LOSING ANY HEAT TO THEIR SURROUNDINGS 
THEY ARE USING HARDLY ANY ENERGY 
AND THEIR METABOLISM HAS SLOWED DOWN ALMOST TO A STOP 
ALTHOUGH IN THE DEEPEST HIBERNATION 
THEY HAVE TO WAKE UP NOW AND THEN TO HAVE A DRINK 
AS THEY FIRE UP THEIR BODY CHEMISTRY 
SO THEIR IMAGE ON THE THERMAL CAMERA GLOWS LIKE A FURNACE 
ONCE AWAKE A MALE SEEKS OUT THE SLUMBERING FEMALES 
HE WON'T GET A WARM RECEPTION TO HIS ADVANCES 
BUT HE WON'T MEET WITH MUCH RESISTANCE EITHER 
HE WILL MATE WITH SEVERAL MORE 
AND THEN AFTER A DRINK HE WILL RETURN TO SLEEP UNTIL THE SPRING 
FLIGHT NOT ONLY ENABLED BATS TO CATCH INSECTS IN THE AIR 
IT ALSO ALLOWED THEM TO EXTEND THEIR RANGE 
FAR BEYOND THAT OF ANY OTHER MAMMAL 
BATS WERE THE FIRST MAMMALS TO FIND THEIR WAY TO SOME FRAGMENTS OF LAND ISOLATED IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC 
NEW ZEALAND 
HERE THERE WERE NO CATS NO RATS BUT LOTS OF INSECTS 
PARADISE FOR ANY INSECT HUNTER 
TO SEE THEM I MUST WAIT FOR DARKNESS 
AND THIS IS THE SPECIES I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR 
THESE BATS LOOK NORMAL ENOUGH 
BUT BATS ARE AERIAL PREDATORS AND MUCH OF THE UNEATEN PREY IN NEW ZEALAND IS ON THE GROUND 
THEY CAN FLY ALL RIGHT 
BUT OUR INFRARED CAMERA REVEALS 
THAT THEY ALSO HAVE A VERY UN BAT LIKE WAY OF HUNTING 
THEY LAND ON THE GROUND AND FORAGE THROUGH THE LEAF LITTER 
JUST LIKE SHREWS 
THEY ARE WALKING ON THEIR WRISTS 
WITH THE BONES OF THEIR FINGERS POINTING UP AND SLOTTED INTO A GROOVE ALONG THE UPPER ARM 
NOW THEY SEEM TO BE HUNTING AS A PACK 
INSECTS OR OTHER SMALL CREATURES FLEEING FROM THE JAWS OF ONE 
RUN STRAIGHT INTO THOSE OF ANOTHER 
WORMS ARE A GREAT FAVOURITE 
SO MUCH MORE SATISFYING THAN SEVERAL HUNDRED MOSQUITOES 
AND THEY DON'T WANT TO SHARE THEM WITH ONE ANOTHER EITHER 
THEY FINISH OFF WITH NECTAR FROM THE HADES PLANT THAT BLOOMS ON THE GROUND 
THEY ARE THIS PLANT'S POLLINATORS 
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN A PLANT AND ITS POLLINATOR ARE SLOW TO EVOLVE 
SO THESE BATS MUST HAVE BEEN SCUTTLING OVER THE NEW ZEALAND FOREST FLOOR FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS 
WORMS AND NECTAR ARE EASY PREY BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS 
IT'S A WETA 
A GIANT FLIGHTLESS CRICKET WITH SPINY LEGS AND FEROCIOUS JAWS 
HOW COULD BATS WHOSE ANCESTORS ATE MOSQUITOES TACKLE THIS 
THE WETA CAN FLICK ITS BACK LEGS FORWARD WITH SURPRISING FORCE 
EVEN IF YOU DODGE THAT YOU HAVE TO CONTEND WITH ITS POWERFUL JAWS 
THE INSECT GAINS THE UPPER HAND 
BUT IT'S SOON OVERWHELMED BY NUMBERS 
AND THE BATS FIGHT ONE ANOTHER OVER ITS REMAINS WITH EQUAL FEROCITY 
EVOLUTION DOESN'T OFTEN GO INTO REVERSE BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE HERE 
AFTER SEVERAL MILLION YEARS OF AERIAL COMBAT 
THESE BATS ARE REVERTING TO THE TECHNIQUES OF THEIR ANCESTORS 
MAMMALS HAVE PURSUED INSECTS TO THE FAR CORNERS OF THE EARTH 
THEY'VE CHASED THEM INTO THE SKIES AND BACK DOWN TO THE GROUND 
THE INSECT EATERS WERE THERE RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE RISE OF MAMMALS AND THEY ARE STILL HERE 
THEY ARE ONE OF THE GREAT SUCCESS STORIES IN THE LIFE OF MAMMALS 
BATS ARE SURELY ONE OF THE MOST MAGICAL OF MAMMALS 
BUT THEY'RE ALSO ONE OF THE MOST MYSTERIOUS 
AS THEY SEE THE WORLD IN A WAY THAT IS UTTERLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR WAY 
IT'S SO DIFFERENT THAT WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT WAS UNTIL ABOUT SIXTY YEARS AGO 
THE ACTION OF NATTERER'S BATS PLUCKING SPIDERS FROM THEIR WEBS HAS NEVER BEEN FILMED BEFORE 
THE SHOTS SHOW THE PRECISION OF THEIR FLIGHT AND THEIR ECHOLOCATION 
HOW DID WE COME TO UNDERSTAND THE BAT'S EXTRAORDINARY USE OF SOUND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DISCOVER NOW 
THE STORY STARTS IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE 
WHEN AN AMERICAN BIOLOGIST CALLED DON GRIFFIN WAS WORKING WITH PHYSICISTS AT HARVARD 
USING A REVOLUTIONARY ULTRASOUND DETECTOR 
WHEN A BAT FLEW AT HIM HE BECAME THE FIRST HUMAN TO DETECT THE SOUNDS IT WAS MAKING 
THEY WERE VERY LOUD AND VERY HIGH PITCHED 
THIS DISCOVERY LAUNCHED A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS TO PROVE THAT THE BATS HAVE A SORT OF AIRBORNE RADAR 
AN INVENTION THEN BEING USED IN AEROPLANES 
YET BATS COULD DETECT TINY TARGETS 
PROCESSING THEIR ECHOES IN A BRAIN WEIGHING HALF A GRAM 
WHEN ECHOLOCATION WAS DISCOVERED IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES 
DON GRIFFIN AND ROBERT GALAMBOS 
PRESENTED THE FINDINGS AT A MEETING 
THERE WAS SUCH DISBELIEF WITH THE SUGGESTION THAT BATS USE ECHOLOCATION 
THAT ONE OF THE SCIENTISTS CAME UP TO GALAMBOS 
TOOK HIM BY THE LAPELS FORCEFULLY AND SAID THIS CANNOT BE CORRECT 
BUT GRIFFIN CONTINUED TESTING THE BATS' ABILITY TO AVOID FINE WIRES 
IN THE FLIGHT CAGES AT HARVARD 
BY NINETEEN SIXTY IT WAS CLEAR THAT ECHOLOCATION PROVIDED THE BATS WITH A DETAILED SENSE OF THEIR WORLD 
HELPED TO EXPLORE THAT WORLD 
USING HIGH SPEED TAPE RECORDERS TO SLOW DOWN CALLS 
SHOWED DIFFERENT SPECIES USED SOUND DIFFERENTLY TO SUIT THEIR HABITAT 
THE INTENSITY OF BAT ECHOLOCATION CALLS REALLY VARIES TREMENDOUSLY 
AT ONE EXTREME ARE WHISPERING BATS 
THAT WE CAN BARELY DETECT ON SOME OF OUR EQUIPMENT 
AT THE OTHER EXTREME THERE ARE BATS THAT CAN MAKE CALLS AS LOUD AS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY DECIBELS 
TO PUT THIS INTO CONTEXT THE THRESHOLD OF PAIN IN HUMAN HEARING IS ROUND ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX DECIBELS 
SO THESE CALLS WOULD BE PAINFUL TO US IF WE COULD HEAR THEM 
THE CALLS ARE LOUD IN ORDER TO PRODUCE CLEAR ECHOES FOR THE BAT 
AND TO COPE THE BAT GOES TEMPORARILY DEAF ON EACH CALL 
BY SYNCHRONISING THE NERVE IMPULSE OF THE CALL WITH A MUSCLE IN THE EAR WHICH DISCONNECTS THE EARDRUM 
THIS MAY HAPPEN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TIMES A SECOND 
ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF MUSCLE CONTRACTION OF ANY MAMMAL 
AND OF COURSE IT'S WHAT THE BATS HEAR THAT CREATES THEIR VIEW OF THE WORLD 
UNDERSTANDING THAT WAS A MORE COMPLEX PROBLEM 
IN THE EIGHTIES TRACHOPS THE FRINGE LIPPED BAT 
WAS STUDIED BY AMERICAN SCIENTISTS MERLIN TUTTLE AND MIKE RYAN 
USING ULTRASOUND THE BATS NAVIGATE EFFORTLESSLY THROUGH THE PANAMANIAN RAINFOREST 
BUT THEIR HUNTING STRATEGY WAS EXTRAORDINARY 
THESE BATS GO FOR A LARGE PREY THE MUD PUDDLE FROG 
COLLECTING THEM IN THE FOREST AND TESTING THEM IN A JUNGLE LABORATORY 
SHOWED THAT THEY COULD DISTINGUISH DIFFERENT KINDS OF FROG CALLS PLAYED THROUGH A LOUDSPEAKER 
AS SOON AS WE TURNED ON THE SET THE BAT JUST TOOK OFF FROM ITS PERCH 
MADE A BEELINE TO THE SPEAKER IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THIS BAT THOUGHT THERE WAS A FROG INSIDE THAT BOX 
BY PLAYING DIFFERENT TAPES 
THEY ESTABLISHED JUST WHAT THE BATS WERE ABLE TO HEAR IN THE FROG CALLS 
THEN THEY TESTED THEIR FINDINGS BACK IN THE FOREST 
STUDYING BATS IN THE WILD IS NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT 
BUT IT'S A VITAL STEP TO UNDERSTANDING ANY ANIMAL 
WHISPERING BATS LIKE TRACHOPS AND THE BRITISH LONG EARED BATS 
RELY ONLY ON HEARING TO CATCH PREY 
THEY CAN HEAR THE RUSTLING OF MOTH WINGS 
AND PLUCK THEM FROM BUSHES 
BUT MOST BATS INTERCEPT INSECTS BY PATROLLING THE AIR 
LISTENING TO THE ECHOES OF THEIR OWN CALLS AND ATTACKING THE ONES RETURNED BY THEIR PREY 
WE KNOW THAT THE WAVELENGTH OF THE CALL IS DESIGNED TO PRODUCE THE BEST ECHO FROM MOTH SIZED OBJECTS 
AND THAT THE BAT INCREASES THE RATE OF CALLS AS IT HOMES IN ON THE TARGET FOR GREATER ACCURACY 
THIS IS THE FEEDING BUZZ 
IT'S EXTRAORDINARY HOW FAST THE ACTION HAPPENS 
WE USE BAT DETECTORS TO HEAR THE CALLS AND HIGH SPEED FILMING TO SLOW THE FLIGHT 
SIMPLY TO APPRECIATE THE BEHAVIOUR 
THESE BATS CAN FLY SIX METRES IN A SECOND AND MAY CATCH TWENTY FIVE MOTHS IN A NIGHT 
THE STUDIES IN THE WILD HAVE ALSO IDENTIFIED A WIDE RANGE OF DIFFERENT CALL SIGNATURES 
EACH IS SUITED TO A DIFFERENT HABITAT 
THE CALLS OF WOODLAND EDGE BATS ARE DISTINCT FROM THOSE OF FOREST BATS 
AND FROM ONES THAT HUNT OVER WATER 
BY USING DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES AND DURATION OF CALL 
DIFFERENT SPECIES OF BATS HAVE ADAPTED TO DIFFERENT HABITATS AND HUNTING TECHNIQUES 
THEIR ECOLOGY IS BASED ON SOUND 
ALTHOUGH RESEARCH DURING THE LAST SIXTY YEARS HAS REVEALED EXTRAORDINARY DETAILS 
ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH BATS FIND THEIR WAY AROUND AND HUNT 
THERE'S STILL A GREAT DEAL TO LEARN 
HOW DOES THE BAT'S BRAIN PROCESS THE INFORMATION 
WE KNOW THAT THE STRONGEST ECHOES WILL BE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE BAT SO THEY HAVE A NARROW FIELD OF VIEW 
AND BY USING A WIDE SPECTRUM OF CALL FREQUENCIES 
THE BAT'S BRAIN MAY CONVERT THE ECHOES INTO AN EQUIVALENT OF COLOUR 
BUT CAN THEIR SOUND PERCEPTION SYSTEM BE AS ACCURATE AS OUR COLOUR VISION 
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS TRYING TO WORK OUT 
HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS OF THESE ANIMALS COPE 
IN TERMS OF TIME WE KNOW FROM LABORATORY STUDIES 
THAT BATS CAN MAKE DISCRIMINATIONS IN THE ORDER OF TEN NANOSECONDS 
A NANOSECOND IS A BILLIONTH OF A SECOND 
IN TERMS OF DISTANCE THIS CORRESPONDS TO A DIFFERENCE IN RANGE IN THE ORDER OF TWO MICROMETRES 
SOME SCIENTISTS ARGUE THAT ANIMALS JUST CANNOT MAKE THESE SORTS OF DISCRIMINATIONS 
GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEMS SO THE CHALLENGE IS TRYING TO WORK OUT HOW BATS DO IT 
AND OUR SEQUENCE OF THE NATTERER'S BATS MAY HELP TO SOLVE THAT MYSTERY 
TO DETECT A THREAD OF SPIDER'S WEB FROM ITS ECHO IS TRULY EXTRAORDINARY 
NEXT WEEK IN THE LIFE OF MAMMALS 
WE MEET PREDATORS THAT PREY ON PLANTS 
THEY ARE FORCED TO FIGHT BATTLES WITH THEIR HIGHLY DEFENDED PREY 
WITH ONE ANOTHER 
AND WITH THE MEAT EATERS THAT WOULD EAT THEM
