LIKE THEY'RE HIPBG AND THE KOOKS 
CAME ON ONE IN THE MORNING SO IT 
WAS THE FIRST TIME I'D SEEN THEM IN 
FRONT OF THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE PLAYING THAT 
KIND OF SHOW SO LATE AND I REMEMBER 
THINKING THEY'VE REALLY GRADUATED 
TO A HEADLINE STATUS THERE YOU GO 
THAT'S A BAND THAT CAN STAND ON THE 
SAME STAGE AS MADONNA 
AND BY THE 
FACT THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE STILL 
YOUNG AND MANAGING TO DO THAT WHEN

MESMERISE ME 
TOP FIVE MUSICIANS OF 
ALL TIMES IN MY LIFE L. CAN'T GET 
ELVIS AND OUT OF THE HAND

TESTAMENT TO THAT FACT 
I SEEM TO THINK I THINK I GOT A LITTLE SITUATION 
SO LISTEN TO ME SISTER LISTEN MAYBE YOU CAN HELP 
I THINK I GAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS MY CONSIDERATION 
BUT NOT FOR ME THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO BE FOR SOMEONE ELSE 
WHY ALL THE PEOPLE ALWAYS SEEM TO JUST BE ON VACATION 
SALUTE YOUR SOLUTION NOW SALUTE YOUR SOLUTION 
I FIND MYSELF JUST LOOKING WORTHY OF MY BEST INTENTIONS 
IGNORING ANY KINDA PAUSE I MIGHT RECEIVE AT ALL 
ALL OTHERS SEEM TO FIND A ROAD THAT'S TOUGH TO SATISFACTION

AND IF THERE'S ONE LITTLE ANSWER TO THIS COMPLICATION 
SOMEONE SOMEWHERE SOME HELP ME SETTLE WHAT IS ON MY MIND 
THERE'S ONLY ONE I'M ONLY TAKING GETTING AND RECEIVING

THERE THEY WERE ON THE IN NEW MUSIC 
WE TRUST STAGE DOING A SUPER HYPED 
UP STAGE L. L. THINK WHEN BANDS 
UP THEIR SONGS WHERE THEY GO 
PERFORM THEM LIVE IT MAKES ME 
WONDER WHY THEY DIDN'T DO IT IN THE 
RECORDING PROCESS THEY GO TO THE 
REHEARSALS TO THAT WAS A CRACKING 
RENDITION I THOUGHT 
THERE WAS A 
PARTICULAR SONG ON THE SET I'M 
SONG NAMES AND STUFP 
BUT JACK ON HIS GUITAR FELT LIKE IT 
WAS ANOTHER ATTACHMENT TO HIS BODY 
IT'S LIKE LITERALLY CONNECTED TO 
THE STRINGS EVERYTHING HE DOES 
WHEN HE PLAYS PANO DRUMS GUITAR 
WHATEVER IT'S SO RHYTHMIC LIKE 
HE'S DRUMMING 
SO MANY BANDS 
TEENAGESIDE WATCHING THEM 
AND THEY 
PROVIDED EVERYONE WITH A MONITOR 
WHICH WAS NICE 
VERY NICE FROM 
YOUR HEADLINERS TO THE OPENING ACTS 
TODAY A YOUNG LADY WHO WAS A 
LITTLE BIT NERVOUS ABOUT RADIO ONE'S 
BIG WEEKEND NOT QUITE SURE WHAT 
TO EXPECT SPOKE TO HER AFTER AND 
SHE SAID IT'S THE BEST THING SHE'S 
DONE SO FAR IN HER CAREER JUST A 
GREAT RESPONSE FROM THE AUDIENCE 
AND HAD A BEST TIME WITH HER AND 
HER BAND ON STAGE THIS IS ADELE 
OPENING THE MAIN STAGE THIS MORNING 
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND 
DON'T NEED TO THINK IT OVER 
IF I'M WRONG I AM RIGHT 
DON'T NEED TO LOOK NO FURTHER 
THIS AIN'T LUST I KNOW THIS IS LOVE 
BUT IF I TELL THE WORLD 
I'LL NEVER SAY ENOUGH 
COS IT WAS NOT SAID TO YOU 
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED TO DO 
IF I END UP WITH YOU 
SHOULD I GIVE UP 
OR SHOULD I JUST KEEP CHASING PAVEMENTS 
EVEN IF IT LEADS NOWHERE 
OR WOULD IT BE A WASTE 
EVEN IF I KNEW MY PLACE 
SHOULD I LEAVE IT THERE 
SHOULD I GIVE UP 
OR SHOULD I JUST KEEP CHASING PAVEMENTS 
EVEN IF IT LEADS NOWHERE 
I BUILD MYSELF UP 
AND FLY AROUND IN CIRCLES 
WAITING AS MY HEART DROPS 
AND MY BACK BEGINS TO TINGLE 
FINALLY COULD THIS BE IT 
OR SHOULD I GIVE UP 
OR SHOULD I JUST KEEP CHASING PAVEMENTS 
EVEN IF IT LEADS NOWHERE 
OR WOULD IT BE A WASTE 
EVEN IF I KNEW MY PLACE 
SHOULD I LEAVE IT THERE 
SHOULD I GIVE UP 
OR SHOULD I JUST KEEP CHASING PAVEMENTS 
EVEN IF IT LEADS NOWHERE 
YEAH 
SHOULD I GIVE UP 
OR SHOULD I JUST KEEP CHASING PAVEMENTS 
EVEN IF IT LEADS NOWHERE 
OR WOULD IT BE A WASTE 
EVEN IF I KNEW MY PLACE 
SHOULD I LEAVE IT THERE 
SHOULD I GIVE UP 
OR SHOULD I JUST KEEP ON CHASING PAVEMENTS 
OR SHOULD I JUST KEEP ON CHASING PAVEMENTS 
SHOULD I GIVE UP 
OR SHOULD I JUST KEEP CHASING PAVEMENTS 
EVEN IF IT LEADS NOWHERE 
OR WOULD IT BE A WASTE 
EVEN IF I KNEW MY PLACE 
SHOULD I LEAVE IT THERE 
SHOULD I GIVE UP 
OR SHOULD I JUST KEEP CHASING PAVEMENTS 
EVEN IF IT LEADS NOWHERE 
SHE'S ACTUALLY QUITE A SHY PERSON 
WHATEVER 
I KNOW IT SOUNDS STUPID WHATEVER TO SAY 
I DIDN'T KNOW 
YOU CAN 
HEAR HER BEFORE YOU SEE HER MOST 
TIMES AND STUFF BUT WHEN IT COMES 
TO THINGS OUT THERE SHE WAS LIKE 
THANKS AND SCURRYING OFF STAGE 
BECAUSE SHE'S SO YOUNG SHE'S SHE'S PROBABLY HUMBLED BY IT 
IT WASN'T 
LONG AGO SHE WAS AT SPICE GIRLS 
CONCERTS 
A MONTH AGO 
YOU KNOW CONCERTS WHAT I MEAN WITH THE POSTERS ON 
HER WALL AND NOW SHE'S PERFORMING 
AT RADIO ONE'S BIG WEEKEND ON A MAIN 
STAGE WHAT VOICE AND TALENT 
THAT'S ADELE MOST OF YOU PROBABLY 
OWN THE ALBUM CALLED NINETEEN TO 
GOLDFRAPP 
WHAT A LOVELY LADY JUST GOLDFRAPP SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN AROUND FOR A 
GOOD FEW YEARS AND LIKE YOU SAID 
EARLIER YOU'RE ALWAYS EXCITED 
ABOUT A GOLDFRAPP ALBUM BECAUSE YOU 
NEVER QUITE KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING 
TO GO 
THEY'RE BIG INTO REINVENTION 
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM THEY'RE TRYING 
TOO HARD TO DO IT IT SEEMS AS IF 
THEY ARE FIGT AROUND THE MUSIC YOU 
FOUND OUT MORE TODAY DIDN'T NEW 
YES I MANAGED TO CATCH UP WITH 
ALISON PRIOR TO GOING ON STAGE AND 
SHE DOESN'T DO THAT MANY INTERVIEWS 
BECAUSE SHE'S ANOTHER SHY 
INDIVIDUAL WHICH YOU WOULD NEVER 
IMAGINE FROM WATCHING HER ON STAGE 
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED WHEN I CHAT 
TODAY HER BACKSTAGE 
YOU'RE GOING TO BE BRINGING THE 
GLAMOUR TO THE MAIN STAGE TODAY

DO YOU LIKE 
DOING FESTIVALS

THEY CAN BE A BIT OF A NIGHTMARE 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET TO SOUND 
CHECK BEFORE YOU GO ON STAGE BUT AT 
THE SAME TIME THAT'S QUITE NICE AS 
WELL BECAUSE YOU JUST HAVE TO KIND 
OF THROW CAUTION TO THE WIND AND 
ENJOY IT FOR WHAT IT IS 
THAT'S THE 
BIGGEST TENT IN EUROPE THAT YOU'RE 
PLAYING IN TODAY REALLY 
ERS IT'S REALLY LIKE A SNAKE IT'S GOT SO MANY 
YOU

HAPPINESS AND STUFF BUT THERE 
MUST BE OLDER STUFF IN THE SET HOW 
DO YOU DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT TO 
PLAY 
YOU WANT TO GET PEOPLE GOING PLAY YOU DON'T WANT TO BORE THEM AND 
BUT AT A FESTIVAL IT'S DIFFERENT 
THERE'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT 
ATMOSPHERE IF YOU PLAY THINGS THAT 
ARE VERY SLOW AND THINGS YOU HAVE 
TO REALLY LISTEN TO SOMETIMES DON'T 
WORK SO WELL AT A FESTIVAL I THINK
