RULE BRITANNIA BRITANNIA RULES THE WAVES 
WE'VE ALL SUNG THAT SONG AND THIS IS WHERE SHE RULED IT FROM PORTSMOUTH HARBOUR 
IT'S HOME TO THE ROYAL NAVY AND TODAY IT'S HOME TO FLOG IT 
PORTSMOUTH IS A LIVELY MARITIME CITY 
WITH EVERY TYPE OF SEAGOING VESSEL DOCKED IN ITS HARBOUR 
THEY TELL ITS HISTORY AND NOW AS MUCH AS EVER 
PORTSMOUTH'S PROSPERITY COMES FROM THE SEA 
HERE WE ARE OUTSIDE THE SPLENDID GUILDHALL 
WE HAVE A FANTASTIC QUEUE IT SNAKES ALL THE WAY DOWN THE ROAD 
IT'S NINE HUNDRED THIRTY SO WE SHOULD GET THE DOORS OPEN AND GET THIS MASSIVE QUEUE INSIDE 
I WONDER WHAT ANTIQUES AND COLLECTIBLES ARE AWAITING OUR EXPERTS TODAY 
ANITA MANNING AND JAMES LEWIS 
MARIE WE'RE IN PORTSMOUTH AND ALL THE NICE GIRLS LIKE A SAILOR 
AND I LOVE THIS WEE GUY SO DO I 
AND HIS BIRD YES 
TELL ME WHERE DID YOU GET THEM 
MANY MANY YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS AT SEA AND HELPED TO LOOK AFTER A PASSENGER 
WERE YOU A SAILOR 
I WAS A CHILDREN'S HOSTESS WITH P. AND AMP O. 
AND I DON'T KNOW SHE SAID TO ME ONE DAY 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE THESE MY DEAR 
SHE HAD A PERSONAL MAID WITH HER 
AND SHE SAID DON'T LET FRANCES KNOW I GAVE THEM TO YOU 
I SAID NO IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO 
DID YOU LET THE CHILDREN YOU WERE IN CHARGE WITH PLAY WITH THEM 
NO I DID NOT NO WAY 
THEY HAD LOTS OF OTHER THINGS THEY PLAYED WITH 
SO THESE WERE YOUR OWN THEY WERE MINE 
YOUR PERSONAL MY OWN PERSONAL THINGS HANGING IN MY CABIN LOVELY 
WELL THESE ARE INTERESTING THEY ARE GERMAN DOLLS 
NOW GERMANY WAS RENOWNED FOR DOLLS AND THESE I WOULD DATE 
FROM THE LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS TO THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS 
REALLY AS OLD AS THAT YEAH 
THEY ARE IN GOOD CONDITION THE CLOTHES ARE ORIGINAL 
WE HAVE A NAUTICAL THEME YES 
A LITTLE BIT OF DAMAGE WHICH WILL MAKE A WEE DIFFERENCE 
A WEE BIT OF DAMAGE ON HER HANDS 
BUT IT'S NOT TOO BAD THE FACES ARE IN GOOD CONDITION 
THE LITTLE BOY'S EYES DON'T OPEN AND CLOSE 
BUT THE LITTLE GIRL'S DOES 
NOW PRICE WISE I THINK THEY SHOULD BE SOLD AS A PAIR 
OH YES I WOULD PUT THEM IN TOGETHER AS ONE LOT 
AND I WOULD ESTIMATE THEM ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY TO SELL THEM AT THAT PRICE YES I WOULD 
WE WOULD PERHAPS IF YOU WISH PUT A RESERVE PRICE ON THEM 
AROUND ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY I'LL LEAVE THAT TO YOU UH HUH 
SO YOU'VE ENJOYED THEM YOU LIKE THEM 
TELL ME WHY DO YOU WANT TO SELL THEM 
WELL I THOUGHT I'VE HAD THEM 
AND THEY'VE JUST BEEN WRAPPED UP SINCE I RETIRED IN ACTUAL FACT 
AND PERHAPS I COULD HAVE A NICE NEW CARPET FOR MY BEDROOM OR SOMETHING 
WELL LET'S PUT IT TO AUCTION YES 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THEM IN 
AND I'LL SEE YOU IN CHICHESTER I HOPE SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANITA NICE MEETING YOU YOU TOO 
WELL WE'RE DOING FLOG IT 
AND IT JUST WOULDN'T BE FLOG IT WITHOUT A BIT OF CLARICE CLIFF 
I WAS GETTING WORRIED I DIDN'T THINK WE'D FIND ANY 
SHEILA THIS IS A FANTASTIC BIG CHUNK OF CLARICE CLIFF 
IS IT SOMETHING YOU'VE HAD AT HOME AND ENJOYED WITH FLOWERS 
NO I PUT AWAY BECAUSE I'VE HAD IT FOR THIRTY YEARS 
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL I SAW THE ANTIQUES ROAD PROGRAMME 
GOING BACK SOME YEARS LATER 
THAT I REALISED IT WAS OF SOME VALUE 
SO I WAS WORRIED ABOUT IT GETTING BROKEN SO I PUT IT AWAY 
O. K. SO YOU DON'T HAVE IT OUT TO ENJOY NO NOT NOW O. K. 
THAT'S WHY YOU WANT TO FLOG IT YES O. K. 
WE ALL KNOW ABOUT CLARICE CLIFF ONE OF THE BEST DESIGNERS OF THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
THE MOST FAMOUS OF ALL THE ART DECO DESIGNERS 
AND THIS IS SLIGHTLY MORE UNUSUAL THOUGH 
THIS IS A RANGE CALLED 
HAVE A LOOK UNDERNEATH GLORIA 
THERE WAS BIZARRE THERE WAS FANTASQUE 
GLORIA IS ONE OF THE BIZARRE RANGES 
AND IT WAS A RANGE OF WARES THAT HAD THIS LATONA GLAZE 
THE LATONA GLAZE IS A CREAMIER COLOUR GLAZE 
INSTEAD OF THAT QUITE DARK YELLOW YOU OFTEN FIND ON CLARICE CLIFF 
LATONA WAS AN UNDERGLAZE RATHER THAN AN OVERGLAZE 
BUT IT GIVES A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IMPRESSION OF THE PIECE 
IT GIVES A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LOOK 
ALMOST LIKE CRAYON RATHER THAN OIL PAINT 
THAT SORT OF DIFFERENCE 
ON A CLASSIC BIZARRE FANTASQUE PIECE 
WHERE ALL THE COLOURS ARE BRIGHT OVERGLAZE 
THESE ARE SLIGHTLY THINNER SLIGHTLY MORE DISPERSED 
THEY'RE NOT QUITE AS BOLD 
SO THEREFORE THEY'RE NOT QUITE AS SOUGHT AFTER 
THIS IS KNOWN AS A LOTUS VASE TWO HANDLED LOTUS VASE 
NOW THESE ARE QUITE ROUNDED IN THEIR STYLE AND IN THEIR DESIGN 
THE WARES AND THE PIECES MAKING THE BIG MONEY AT THE MOMENT 
ARE THE SLIGHTLY MORE WEIRD SHAPES MORE ANGULAR 
SLIGHTLY MORE WACKY SHAPES YES 
MORE ART DECO CONDITION IT'S FAIR 
NOTHING SERIOUSLY WRONG BUT IF WE TURN IT ROUND 
SEE THERE OH YES IT HAS AN L. SHAPED HAIRLINE CRACK 
SO 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH 
I HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE I REALLY DON'T KNOW O. K. 
IN PERFECT CONDITION I'D PUT FIVE HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED ON IT 
WITH A BIT OF DAMAGE 
LET'S SAY THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED YES 
PUT A RESERVE OF THREE HUNDRED ON IT 
IF IT DOESN'T MAKE THREE HUNDRED TAKE IT HOME 
O. K. 
NICKY WHAT A LOVELY LITTLE OCCASIONAL TABLE 
I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD BE HAVING A GAME OF CHESS OR A CAPPUCCINO 
IT'S ALMOST A CHESS SET IT IS YES 
IT'S GORGEOUS 
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS FROM 
IT'S REPUTED TO HAVE COME FROM MY GREAT GRANDFATHER 
WHO WAS A SHIP'S CARPENTER 
SO HE WOULD HAVE A GREAT APPRECIATION FOR WOODS ABSOLUTELY 
WE ALWAYS FELT THAT IF HE HAD CARED ENOUGH TO BRING IT BACK 
THAT IT MUST BE QUITE NICE O. K. 
WAS HE IN ITALY BY ANY CHANCE HE HAD BEEN ALL OVER THE WORLD 
BUT YES ALL OF EUROPE ITALY FRANCE AND SO ON 
WE'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IT WAS ITALIAN YES IT IS ITALIAN 
THIS TUMBLING CUBE EFFECT IS VERY TUNBRIDGE WARE 
YES OF COURSE IT HAPPENED IN ITALY AS WELL 
NOT JUST TUNBRIDGE WELLS IT IS STUNNING 
NOW ALL OF THIS IS WALNUT AND SATINWOOD 
WHICH HAS BEEN CUT AND GLUED ON 
IT'S VERY VERY THIN STRIPS OF WOOD POSSIBLY 
TWO MILLIMETRES IN THICKNESS WHICH HAS BEEN GLUED ON 
TO A PINE TABLE TOP OH RIGHT 
YEAH AND HERE LOOK YOU CAN SEE THE MAKER'S LABEL 
YES I WONDERED IF THERE MIGHT BE A DATE ON THERE BUT 
I CAN'T SEE A DATE 
IT'S TERRIBLY FOXED 
IT IS A PARQUETRY TABLE 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MARQUETRY AND PARQUETRY 
IS MARQUETRY HAS MORE BIOMORPHIC SHAPES 
LIKE TREES CASTLES IMAGES 
WHEREAS PARQUETRY IS ALL SYMMETRICAL SHAPES 
RIGHT EVERYTHING'S THE SAME SIZE 
IT'S MORE GEOMETRIC 
AND THIS IS STUNNING THIS TUMBLING CUBE 
THE TABLE'S NOT BEEN REDUCED IN SIZE 
BECAUSE EVEN AROUND THE EDGE IT'S BEEN BANDED 
YES AND IT CONTINUES ALL THE WAY DOWN 
ALL THE WAY DOWN THIS PEDESTAL BASE 
THIS LOVELY BALUSTRADE TURNING 
THIS IS SOME OLIVE WOOD THIS IS TURNED IN TWO DIFFERENT 
SECTIONS AND GLUED TOGETHER OH I SEE YES 
HERE WE'VE GOT SOME EBONY STRINGING ON THE TRIPOD BASE 
THE CONDITION IS SUPERB YOU'VE REALLY LOOKED AFTER THIS 
IT'S COVERED UP ALL THE TIME I HAVE DOGS AND CATS 
I'M FRIGHTENED TO DEATH THAT IT'LL GET DAMAGED REALLY 
SO IT'S COVERED ALL THE TIME 
ANY IDEA OF ITS VALUE 
WE THOUGHT PERHAPS AROUND THREE HUNDRED MY HUSBAND'S A HOBBY CABINET MAKER 
AND WHEN HE WAS AT COLLEGE HIS LECTURER SUGGESTED 
IT MIGHT BE VALUED IN THAT REGION 
I CAN GIVE YOU A NICE PLEASANT SURPRISE THEN 
I THINK FINGER'S CROSSED ON A GOOD DAY WE'LL DOUBLE THAT REALLY 
YES YES WOW THAT WOULD BE REALLY NICE 
I'D LIKE TO SAY DEFINITELY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT AUCTIONS ARE LIKE 
IT'S NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE SO I'LL PUT THIS INTO AUCTION 
WITH A VALUATION O. F. FOUR HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED WOW 
THAT'S GOOD O. K. AND WE'LL PUT A FIXED RESERVE OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY LOVELY 
YOU DO NOT WANT TO LET THIS GO FOR ANY LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY GREAT 
THIS WILL FLY AWAY I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS ONE GO UNDER THE HAMMER 
DARYL THE THING I LIKE ABOUT CARNIVAL GLASS 
IS THAT IT'S SO CHEERY 
YES YEAH I'M TOLD THAT YOU'RE ONE OF THESE MAD COLLECTORS 
AND YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF THIS STUFF 
HOW MANY PIECES DO YOU HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION 
SEVENTY 
DOES YOUR WIFE LIKE THEM NO 
NO SHE DOESN'T 
DOES SHE THINK YOU'RE MAD 
YES YEAH 
TELL ME WHY YOU LIKE IT 
COS IT'S PRETTY IT'S CHEAP AND YOU CAN GET A BARGAIN 
I ALSO BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE A BIT OF AN EXPERT ON THIS STUFF 
I TEND TO KNOW MY STUFF WITH IT YEAH 
THAT'S WHY I'M DELIGHTED I'M WITH YOU TODAY 
SO YOU CAN TELL ME ALL ABOUT THIS 
DO THESE THINGS HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES 
YES THEY DO YEAH CAN YOU DESCRIBE THEM TO ME 
THIS IS PONY MADE BY DUGAN 
LUSTRE ROSE MADE BY IMPERIAL 
FREE FRUITS MADE BY NORTHWOOD 
YOU CAN TELL WITH THE TRADEMARK BASKET WEAVE BACK 
PEACOCK AND GRAPE AND PEACOCK AND URN BOTH BY FENTON RIGHT 
SO THESE ARE AMERICAN THESE THREE HERE THEY'RE ALL AMERICAN 
WE DID MAKE IT HERE BUT WE DON'T GET THE PRETTY STUFF RIGHT 
AND THIS PETROL SHADE HERE I ALWAYS THINK THAT'S QUITE DESIRABLE 
I LIKE IT BETTER THAN THAT ORDINARY ORANGE 
YOU ARE RIGHT YEAH THIS IS LESS DESIRABLE THAN THE COLOURED PIECES 
BUT WE'VE STILL GOT A GOOD WEE LOT THERE 
YEAH IT'S A GOOD STARTER PACK 
IT'S THE TYPE OF STUFF THAT BRIGHTENS UP YOUR LIFE 
IT REALLY IS CHEERY IT WANTS TO MAKE ME SMILE 
THAT'S IT THAT'S WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT IT'S BRIGHT 
POOR MAN'S TIFFANY IS ITS NICKNAME THAT'S RIGHT OF COURSE 
IT'S QUITE CHEERY STUFF YEAH 
HOW MUCH IS THIS STUFF WORTH 
THESE PARTICULAR PIECES NOT AN AWFUL LOT 
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE SELLING THEM 
THEY'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR MY COLLECTION ANY MORE 
AND THEY'RE WORTH 
FIFTEEN EACH MAYBE 
YOU KNOW YOU'RE MAKING MY JOB AWFUL EASY 
WE CAN CERTAINLY PUT THEM IN TO AUCTION 
AND AS YOU'VE SAID THEY ARE NOT OF THE 
THE RAREST NO OR THE BEST 
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY IF WE PUT THEM INTO SALE 
SAY WITH AN ESTIMATE OF FORTY TO SIXTY ON IT 
OF COURSE YES YEAH 
WE'LL DO THAT I THINK THEY SHOULD GO AWAY 
THEY'RE GETTING FIVE PIECES HERE AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL DO WELL 
NOW LET'S HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT WHAT WE HAVE TO TEMPT THE BIDDERS 
FIRST THE PAIR OF GERMAN DOLLS 
THEY'RE IN SUCH GOOD OVERALL CONDITION 
THE SLIGHT DAMAGE TO THE GIRL'S HAND SHOULDN'T HOLD THEM BACK 
DESPITE THE HAIRLINE CRACK SHEILA'S LARGE CLARICE CLIFF VASE 
IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF EXCELLENT SAFEKEEPING 
NICOLA ALSO HAD THE FORESIGHT TO PRESERVE 
HER LOVELY INLAID WALNUT TABLE BY PROTECTING IT FROM HER DOGS 
AND FINALLY DARYL HAS SEVENTY OF THESE AT HOME 
SO LET'S SEE IF THESE FIVE PIECES OF CARNIVAL GLASS 
CATCH THE EYE OF ANOTHER COLLECTOR 
FOR OUR AUCTION TODAY WE'VE MOVED ALONG THE COASTLINE TO THE HISTORIC TOWN OF CHICHESTER 
TO HENRY ADAMS AUCTIONEERS WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY NINE 
SO LET'S CATCH UP WITH THE MAN WHO'S GOING TO BE ON THE ROSTRUM 
AUCTIONEER LESLIE WELLER AND SEE WHAT HE'S GOT TO SAY 
ABOUT SOME OF OUR OWNERS' ITEMS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY OUR EXPERTS' VALUATIONS 
HAVE THEY GOT IT RIGHT 
WELL FINGERS CROSSED WE'LL FIND OUT IN JUST A MOMENT 
LESLIE IT WOULDN'T BE FLOG IT WITHOUT CLARICE CLIFF WOULD IT IT CERTAINLY WOULDN'T 
WE'VE GOT A FANTASTIC EXAMPLE HERE IT BELONGS TO SHEILA 
SHE'S HAD IT THIRTY ODD YEARS 
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S GOT A HAIRLINE CRACK 
HENCE THE VALUE THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED 
YES THAT IS THE PROBLEM 
THE CLARICE CLIFF MARKET IS FANTASTIC AT THE PRESENT TIME 
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF COLLECTORS OUT THERE LOOKING FOR THIS SORT OF THING 
AND ALL THE DIFFERENT DESIGNS AND PATTERNS 
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE DAMAGE IT KNOCKS THE VALUE SIGNIFICANTLY IT DOES 
COLLECTORS ARE PURISTS THEY'RE A FUSSY LOT BASICALLY 
THEY ARE A FUSSY LOT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE 
BUT WHEN IT'S RIGHT THEY PAY THROUGH THE ROOF ABSOLUTELY 
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO POSSESSIVE THAT IF IT WAS PERFECT 
WOULD PROBABLY MAKE ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BUT WITH THAT DAMAGE THAT IS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM 
BUT WE SHALL DO OUR BEST I'M SURE YOU WILL 
I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET UP ON THE ROSTRUM IN A MOMENT AND WEAVE YOUR MAGIC SO GOOD LUCK WE'LL TRY 
AND GOOD LUCK FOR SHEILA TOO 
I'VE JUST BEEN JOINED BY MARIE AND WE'RE SELLING THOSE GERMAN DOLLS 
WE'RE HOPEFULLY GOING TO GET TWO HUNDRED PLUS MAYBE THREE HUNDRED 
WELL IT WOULD BE NICE WOULDN'T IT AM I CHANCING MY LUCK 
I THINK SO I THINK SO TOO I'LL TREAT YOU TO A PINT IF OH O. K. 
AND ANITA SHE DID THE WORK 
WELL I HOPE THESE DOLLS DO REALLY REALLY WELL

SAVE IT UP FOR A RAINY DAY 
THERE ARE LOTS OF THOSE THERE ARE AREN'T THERE 
NEXT UP IT'S SHEILA'S CLARICE CLIFF VASE 
AND I HOPE THAT CRACK WON'T CAUSE IT TO RAIN ON HER PARADE 
I HAD A CHAT EARLIER WITH LESLIE THE AUCTIONEER 
HE SAID SHAME ABOUT THAT DAMAGE 
COS IT WOULD BE WORTH ABOUT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED OH NO 
WHEN MY SON WAS YOUNGER HE ACTUALLY USED TO ROLL MARBLES IN THERE 
COS I DIDN'T REALISE IT HAD ANY VALUE AT THE TIME OH 
HOW FUNNY IS THAT ROLLING MARBLES IN SOMETHING SO VALUABLE 
BUT AT LEAST YOU HAD THE FORESIGHT 
TO PUT IT AWAY FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS AND LOOK AFTER IT 
AND WE ARE LOOKING AT THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED HERE 
LESLIE THOUGHT WE MIGHT GET THE LOWER END BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGE 
IT'S GOT A HAIRLINE IN THE TOP BUT IT'S STILL A GOOD BIG ATTRACTIVE PIECE

YOU'VE BOUGHT SOMETHING 
GOOD FOR YOU THAT'S WHAT AUCTIONS ARE FOR 
A DOUBLE WHAMMY YOU'VE BOUGHT SOMETHING AND YOU'VE SOLD SOMETHING 
THANKS FOR COMING IN THANK YOU 
O. K. MY TURN TO BE THE EXPERT 
OCCASIONALLY WE GET FURNITURE ON THE SHOW WHICH IS GREAT 
AND THIS IS WHAT WE'VE GOT AN OCCASIONAL TABLE AND IT BELONGS TO NICOLA 
HOPEFULLY NOT FOR MUCH LONGER 
WE'VE GOT FOUR HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED RIDING ON THIS 
THE AUCTIONEER HASN'T SPOKEN TO ME ABOUT IT 
SO I ASSUME HE AGREES WITH MY VALUATION 
FINGERS CROSSED

BRILLIANT HE'S DONE IT THAT'S GOOD 
I WAS WORRIED I DID GET WORRIED IT SOLD ON THE RESERVE 
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW HOW TIGHT IT WAS IT WAS VERY TIGHT 
ARE YOU SAD TO SEE IT GO IN A WAY 
BUT IT WORRIED ME ALL THE TIME THAT IT'D BE DAMAGED 
SO I'LL BUY AN M. F. I. ONE TO PUT IN THE CORNER 
AND SPEND THE REST ON SOMETHING ELSE SHE'S GOT IT ALL SORTED OUT 
I'VE BOUGHT SOME PICTURES ACTUALLY GOOD FOR YOU 
I'VE COME TO THE PALLANT HOUSE GALLERY IN CHICHESTER 
WHICH HOUSES THE SANDY WILSON COLLECTION 
OF TWENTIETH CENTURY BRITISH ART 
IT INCLUDES WORK BY ONE OF OUR MOST RESPECTED MODERN ARTISTS SIR PETER BLAKE 
FAMOUS FOR HIS POP ART FEATURING HEROES OF POPULAR CULTURE 
FROM WRESTLERS TO ROCK STARS 
AND HE'S HERE TO TALK TO ME ABOUT HIS EARLY WORK 
THE WORLD WAS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PLACE BACK IN THE SIXTIES 
AND HOW DID PEOPLE REACT TO YOUR WORK BACK THEN 
WELL I SUPPOSE SOMETHING LIKE THIS PICTURE OF ELVIS 
I SUPPOSE ELVIS WASN'T REALLY A PROPER SUBJECT MATTER 
FOR A PICTURE THEN M. M. M. SO PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED 
AND IN A WAY THAT'S HOW MY PART OF POP ART HAPPENED 
I WAS PAINTING UNFAMILIAR SUBJECT MATTER 
SUBJECT MATTER THAT WASN'T PART OF ART HISTORY 
THIS LOOKS SLIGHTLY UNFINISHED IS IT IT IS 
IT'S A VERY AMBITIOUS PICTURE 
AND I THINK THE GIRL ON THE END IS FINISHED AND THERE ARE BITS 
THIS PANEL FOR INSTANCE IS BEGINNING TO WORK 
BUT I THINK IT'S A PICTURE THAT PROBABLY TIME RAN OUT ON 
IS THAT WHAT IT WAS I THINK SO 
IT STILL HAPPENS I MEAN WHEN I START A PICTURE 
I ALWAYS ATTEMPT TOO MUCH 
BUT I HAVE MORE TIME NOW TO KEEP GOING AND TRY AND FINISH THINGS 
DO YOU GO BACK ON A PICTURE A FEW YEARS LATER 
OR LIKE IN THIS CASE 
WOULD YOU GO BACK ON IT IF YOU WERE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY 
I WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO NOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO 
I'D LOVE TO BUT IT'S EXISTED LIKE THIS FOR FIFTY YEARS SO IN A WAY 
IT'S ACCEPTED I SUPPOSE I WOULD START A NEW VERSION OF IT 
RATHER THAN GO BACK TO THIS ONE 
I WANT YOU I NEED YOU 
I LOVE YOU 
WITH ALL MY HEART 
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WE'VE ENDED UP AT THIS ONE 
WHICH IS POSSIBLY YOUR FAVOURITE PIECE ISN'T IT 
IT'S MY FAVOURITE HERE I THINK YEAH 
IT WAS A PANEL I TOOK FROM THE BACK OF A PICTURE FRAME 
SPLIT IT IN HALF AND THEN ON THIS HALF I PAINTED 
THE SIRIOL SHE DEVIL OF NAKED MADNESS 
AND THE OTHER HALF WAS CALLED LOUELLA THE WORLD'S MOST TATTOOED WOMAN 
AND IT'S A PAINTING OF TWO FAIRGROUND PERFORMERS 
THE SHE DEVIL OF NAKED MADNESS I ACTUALLY SAW 
WHAT ABOUT THE WRESTLER WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO PAINT A GUY WRESTLING 
JUST AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR WHEN THERE'D BEEN NO SPORT DURING THE WAR 
THERE WAS SUDDENLY AN ENORMOUS THING OF GOING OUT 
AND NOT MANY PEOPLE HAD TELEVISIONS SO PEOPLE WERE DESPERATE TO GO TO LIVE ENTERTAINMENT 
AND WRESTLING WAS GREAT THEATRE 
SO I WENT FROM NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN WITH MY MOTHER AND AUNT 
AND THEN JUST LOVED IT FROM THEN ON ALL THE STARS OF THE DAY 
IT WAS QUITE POPULAR WHEN I WAS A YOUNG LAD I REMEMBER A GUY CALLED MICK MCMANUS WRESTLING AWAY 
THAT WAS THE VERY FIRST FIGHT I SAW WAS IT 
MICK MCMANUS VERSUS AL LITMAN 
AL LITMAN'S SPECIALITY WAS TO RUN AWAY AND CLIMB OUT OF THE RING 
AND THEN HE'D BE PULLED BACK IN 
WHY ONE EYE AND THAT'S ALL SCRATCHED OUT AS WELL 
IT'S SOMETHING I'VE NEVER EVEN EXPLAINED TO MYSELF SATISFACTORILY 
IT'S SOMETHING TO DO ABOUT COMMENTING ON PAINTING 
I THINK THE VERY FIRST PICTURES I PROBABLY THOUGHT 
WELL YOU'VE DONE ONE WHY BOTHER TO DO ANOTHER ONE START ANOTHER PICTURE 
AND IN THAT ONE I'M TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING AS THOUGH IT WAS AN 
EXISTING PIECE OF ART ALREADY IT HAS COME FROM A FAIRGROUND 
SO I'M PRETENDING THAT I'M SOMEBODY ELSE SCRATCHING OUT MY PAINTING 
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND THE WHOLE THING OF THE MASK 
THE WHOLE MYTHOLOGY OF THE MASKED WRESTLER IS SOMETHING 
THAT'S ALWAYS FASCINATED ME BECAUSE THERE WERE STORIES LIKE 
ONE STORY WAS THAT A VERY PROMINENT MEMBER OF THE ROYAL FAMILY 
WAS A PROFESSIONAL MASKED WRESTLER 
AND I ALWAYS USED TO THINK WHO COULD THAT BE WHICH ONE 
AND THERE WERE GREAT STORIES ABOUT THE MASKS 
DID YOU PAINT THIS IN THE EARLY SIXTIES 
THE PAINTING'S CALLED THE NINETEEN SIXTY TWO BEATLES 
BUT IT WAS PAINTED IN SIXTY THREE STARTED IN SIXTY THREE WHEN DID YOU FINISH THAT 
U. M. SIXTY EIGHT I WORKED ON THAT FOR FIVE YEARS 
THEY'RE IMAGES FROM A MAGAZINE 
AND THE IDEA ORIGINALLY 
THESE WHITE PANELS WHAT ARE THEY FOR THE IDEA WAS 
THAT I GOT THEM TO AUTOGRAPH THE PICTURE PAUL WAS THE FIRST PERSON 
WHO CAME TO THE STUDIO 
WITHOUT ACTUALLY REFUSING TO SIGN IT 
HE LEFT THE STUDIO WITHOUT SIGNING IT 
I THINK HE PROBABLY DIDN'T LIKE THE FACT THAT THE EYES WEREN'T THE SAME OR YOU HADN'T QUITE GOT THE SMILE 
PAUL'S STILL A FRIEND YES BUT AT THE TIME 
HE PROBABLY WASN'T QUITE HAPPY WITH IT 
BUT THE THING WAS THAT PAUL DIDN'T SIGN IT 
SO I ABANDONED THE IDEA YEAH 
LET'S LOOK AT SOMETHING ELSE FOR THE BEATLES FANS TO LOOK AT O. K. 
HERE IT IS POSSIBLY THE MOST TALKED ABOUT ALBUM SLEEVE OF ALL TIME ISN'T IT SGT PEPPER 
IT IS THIS IS THE INNER SLEEVE YES THIS ISN'T THE COVER 
THE COVER WAS MADE BY BUILDING THE WHOLE THING LIKE A BIG STAGE SET 
THIS ACTUALLY IS A PIECE OF ARTWORK 
SO THE LETTERING IS HAND DONE 
SANDY WILSON BOUGHT IT FOR HIS WIFE M. J. MANY YEARS AGO THAT'S STUNNING 
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING IN YOUR POCKET WELL IT'S ENTRY LEVEL IN COLLECTING SIR PETER BLAKE'S WORK 
IT'S CALLED POP ART 
IT'S FOUR SEPARATE BADGES 
HEART TARGET STAR AND A POP ART IMAGE 
ALL IN BRIGHTLY COLOURED ENAMELS WELL I'M GOING TO INVEST IN THAT YOU HAVE THAT ONE OH THANK YOU 
HOW AMAZING SIR PETER IT'S BEEN AN HONOUR AND A PLEASURE MEETING YOU 
AND TALKING TO THE MAN WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ICONIC ART 
YOU'VE MADE MY YEAR YOU REALLY HAVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
BRIAN I'M FASCINATED BY THIS TYPE OF THING 
IT'S A LITTLE PIECE OF OUR SOCIAL HISTORY 
IT IS TELL ME WHERE DID YOU GET IT 
SADLY MY FATHER PASSED AWAY JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS 
AND THIS WAS PART OF THE HOUSE WHEN WE CLEARED IT 
IT WAS ACTUALLY WRAPPED IN CLINGFILM BETWEEN TWO ORDINARY DINNER PLATES 
WAS HE A METHODIST NO HE WASN'T PARTICULARLY A CHURCHGOER AT ALL 
BUT HE HAD CONNECTIONS 
BACK THROUGH HIS OWN PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS 
SO THERE IS SOME CONNECTION THERE YES THERE IS SOME CONNECTION YES 
THIS PLATE IS COMMEMORATING THE CENTENARY OF THE METHODISTS 
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVEN TO NINETEEN OH SEVEN 
AND IT HAS RATHER INTERESTING PICTURES 
AND WRITING ROUND THE EDGE HERE WE HAVE 
THE LITTLE CLOUD INCREASETH STILL 
WHICH FIRST AROSE UPON MOW HILL 
NOW I HAVEN'T HEARD OF THAT PLACE NO UNFORTUNATELY NOR HAVE I 
AND HERE FIRST CAMP MEETING HELD AT MOW COP 
MAY THIRTY FIRST ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVEN 
AND WE HAVE TWO DIGNITARIES AT THE FRONT 
SO ALL THAT LOVELY HISTORICAL DETAIL YES ON THE PLATE 
IF WE TURN IT ROUND TO LOOK AT THE BACK THIS IS INTERESTING AS WELL WE HAVE 
DETAILS OF THE CHURCH 
WE HAVE CHAPELS PREACHING PLACES MINISTERS 
CHURCH MEMBERS ADHERENTS AND SO ON 
AND TEACHERS SCHOLARS AND AT THE BOTTOM THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY 
AGAIN INTERESTING RECORDS 
YES THE FACTORY WOOD AND AMP SONS 
IT'S NOT A FINE FACTORY IT'S NOT A PARTICULARLY SOUGHT AFTER FACTORY 
THE VALUE OF THIS ITEM AGAIN IS IN ITS SOCIAL HISTORY YES 
WHY DO YOU WANT TO SELL IT BRIAN MY WIFE AND I ARE THE MAIN BENEFICIARIES FROM DAD'S ESTATE 
AND I'M LEFT WITH THE CONTENTS OF TWO BUNGALOWS TO AMALGAMATE INTO ONE 
BRIAN 
YOU'VE JUST GOT TOO MUCH STUFF ABSOLUTELY 
I WOULD LIKE TO ESTIMATE IT IN THE REGION OF TWENTY TO THIRTY YES 
AND LET IT FIND ITS OWN LEVEL WOULD YOU BE HAPPY WITH THAT THAT'S FINE LET'S PUT IT TO AUCTION 
IN CHICHESTER AND I'M SURE IT WILL DO WELL 
IN PORTSMOUTH I WAS SURE I'D FIND SOMETHING OF NAVAL INTEREST I SAW YOU IN THE QUEUE WITH THIS MUSTARD 
AND IT HAD AN EMBLEM ON THE FRONT AND I THOUGHT MILITARY FANTASTIC 
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE NAVY AND LOCAL MARITIME HISTORY 
BUT IT'S RIFLE BRIGADE WHAT'S IT DOING HERE IN PORTSMOUTH 
WE DON'T KNOW IT CAME FROM MY GRANDDAD'S 
HE USED TO COLLECT SILVER PEOPLE WOULD JUST GIVE HIM BITS 
IT WAS IN A BOX MY NAN GAVE ME FOR CAR BOOTING OH MY GOODNESS 
I HAVE TO SAY IF THIS WAS MINE I WOULDN'T BE SELLING IT 
NOW STEVE YOU DON'T NOT REALLY WANT HER TO SELL IT DO YOU NO 
IT'S SUCH A SWEET LITTLE PIECE IT'S LOVELY AND THE HISTORY WITH IT 
THE ASSOCIATION WITH THE RIFLE BRIGADE YOU KNOW A BIT OF THE REGIMENT'S HISTORY 
WELL I KNOW THE RIFLE BRIGADE WAS DISBANDED 
I BELIEVE BEFORE THE SECOND WORLD WAR O. K. 
AND NO DOUBT ON THE DISBANDMENT OF THE REGIMENT 
MAYBE SMALL PIECES DISAPPEARED INTO PRIVATE HANDS 
FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THE COOK'S POCKET 
OR PERHAPS SOME YOUNG SUBALTERN DECIDED TO HAVE A SMALL SOUVENIR THE INTERESTING THING IS 
I LOOKED AT THE HALLMARK EARLIER 
WE'VE GOT M. AND AMP W. FOR MAPPIN AND AMP WEBB THE CROWN THE MARK FOR SHEFFIELD 
THE LION OF COURSE WHICH IS SILVER AND THE DATE CODE NINETEEN SEVENTEEN 
SO IT'S SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR MY PARENTS SAID THEY COULDN'T EVEN GET PORCELAIN THAT WAS DECORATED 
THEY COULDN'T GET ANYTHING MADE SO IN W. W. I. I. EVERYONE WAS PUTTING EVERYTHING INTO THE WAR EFFORT 
IN WWI 
THEY WERE MAKING SILVER FOR THE RIFLE BRIGADE INSTEAD OF CONCENTRATING ON THE WAR EFFORT 
THIS IS KNOWN AS A TANKARD MUSTARD 
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN PART OF A SET OF THREE 
A MUSTARD A SALT AND A PEPPER EACH WITH THE REGIMENTAL MARKINGS ON THE FRONT 
BUT IT'S A NICE THING WHAT'S IT WORTH DON'T KNOW WHATEVER WHAT DO YOU THINK NO IDEA 
WELL ALL THE OTHER BITS AND PIECES IN THE BOX WERE FOR A CAR BOOT I THINK THAT'S TOO GOOD 
ABSOLUTELY THERE IT IS FIFTY TO EIGHTY 
O. K. IT'S GOING IN TO A GOOD SALE AND I'M SURE IT'LL DO WELL SO LET'S TAKE IT ALONG 
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS THANK YOU 
PHYLLIS I'M SO EXCITED 
TO SEE ALL THIS STUFF I'M GLAD 
BECAUSE THE QUEEN MARY WAS CLYDE BUILT 
A BIT LIKE MYSELF AND OF COURSE THE QUEEN MARY 
SAILED FROM THIS PART OF THE WORLD ALL OVER THE PLACE 
TELL ME WHERE DID YOU GET THIS STUFF 
MY BROTHER WORKED FOR CUNARD LINE FOR THIRTY FOUR YEARS 
AND HE COLLECTED IT THROUGH THE YEARS UH HUH 
AND HE DIED TEN YEARS AGO 
AND IT'S BEEN LEFT TO ME NOW UH HUH 
AND I'VE ONLY GOT IT STUCK IN A CUPBOARD 
AND IF SOMEBODY'S INTERESTED IT COULD GO TO SOMEONE WHO'S INTERESTED 
WHAT DID HE DO WAS HE A STEWARD 
HE WAS IN THE STORES HE WAS A STEWARD 
HE WAS IN THE BAR EVERYTHING NOW WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE 
IT'S A LOVELY WEE MAP OF THE QUEEN MARY'S HISTORY I SUPPOSE 
IF WE LOOK IN HERE IT'S THE VERANDAH CLUB 
I'D IMAGINE THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THEIR POSH BARS 
SO WE OPEN IT UP AND A WONDERFUL PICTURE OF THE QUEEN MARY THERE 
WITH HER THREE FUNNELS 
AND THE MENU AND IT'S A MENU FOR THE HARLOW NIGHT DINNER 
WHAT SORT OF STUFF DID THEY EAT 
CLEAR TURTLE WITH SHERRY HAVE YOU EVER TASTED THAT NO I HAVEN'T I DON'T DRINK 
YOU DON'T DRINK I ONLY DRINK LEMONADE 
WELL THERE WE ARE HERE WE HAVE A COMMEMORATIVE COIN 
THESE WOULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO PASSENGERS CREW 
COMMEMORATING WHEN THE QUEEN MARY FIRST SAILED 
IF WE LIFT THIS 
WE'VE ALSO GOT SOME PHOTOGRAPHS 
OF THE REALLY GLAMMY PEOPLE WHO TRAVELLED ON THE QUEEN MARY 
WHO HAVE WE GOT HERE PHYLLIS 
THAT'S LIBERACE LIBERACE AND WE'VE GOT HIS SIGNATURE YEAH 
AND WE ALSO HAVE THE GORGEOUS ELIZABETH TAYLOR 
AND A LITTLE LATER WE HAVE CLIFF RICHARD AND THE SHADOWS 
AND ON THE BACK OF THIS 
WE HAVE AUTOGRAPHS OF THAT GROUP YES 
IS THERE ANY SENTIMENTAL ATTACHMENT TO THEM PHYLLIS 
NOT NOW COS EVERY TIME I FIND THEM I HAVE A LITTLE WEEP AH RIGHT IT'S TIME THAT THEY WENT NOW 
THE COLLECTORS WILL LOVE THIS 
AND WHAT THEY'LL DO IS THEY'LL MOUNT THEM ON BOARDS AND LOOK AT THEM 
AND PUT THEM IN PART OF THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE MORE ITEMS 
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP THEM CONSERVATIVELY 
AT SAY BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND TWO HUNDRED 
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY TO SELL THIS WEE LOT AT THAT PRICE YES I THINK SO YES 
SO WE'LL HOPE THAT IT WILL SAIL AWAY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME 
NOW FOR A QUICK RECAP 
IT MAY NOT BE HUGELY VALUABLE 
BUT THIS METHODIST PLATE IS FULL OF SOCIAL HISTORY 
FAR TOO GOOD FOR A CAR BOOT SALE THE LITTLE SILVER TANKARD POT SHOULD CUT THE MUSTARD 
HOPEFULLY IT SHOULD BE FULL STEAM AHEAD FOR THE COLLECTION OF QUEEN MARY MEMORABILIA 
LOOK WHAT I'VE FOUND IN THE ENTRANCE HALL OF THE AUCTION ROOM 
A LONG CASE CLOCK MADE IN THE MIDLANDS POSSIBLY MANCHESTER OR LIVERPOOL 
ITS NICKNAME IS THE BROAD BELLY AND YOU CAN SEE WHY 
THIS REMINDS OF THE FIRST LONG CASE CLOCK I EVER BOUGHT 
I PAID ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FOR IT TEN YEARS AGO 
I WAS SO EXCITED BECAUSE IT WORKED AND IT WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION 
AND IT WAS THE IDENTICAL SIZE TO THIS 
THE PROBLEM WAS WHEN I GOT IT HOME BY THE TIME I PUT THE HOOD ON AND STOOD IT UP 
IT ACTUALLY WOULDN'T GO IN THE FLAT THE CEILING WAS TOO LOW 
SO A LESSON TO BE LEARNT THERE IF YOU BUY ANYTHING AT AUCTION TAKE A TAPE MEASURE WITH YOU 
MAKE SURE IT WILL FIT THE SPACE YOU REQUIRE IT TO OTHERWISE YOU'LL WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID 
OH WELL IT'S SO EASY TO GET CARRIED AWAY AT AUCTIONS 
TODAY'S AUCTIONEER LESLIE WELLER THINKS THE BIDDERS MIGHT JUST GET CARRIED AWAY OVER ONE OF OUR ITEMS 
THIS IS AN INTERESTING LOT QUEEN MARY MEMORABILIA BELONGS TO PHYLLIS 
WE'VE GOT A VALUATION OF ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED FOR THE WHOLE LOT 
THERE'S A LOT OF ITEMS HERE A MENU PRESENTATION CARDS 
A MEDAL A PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM 
OF ALL THE STARS THAT WERE ON BOARD 
IT'S A LOVELY LOT ACTUALLY EXCUSE THE PUN BUT IT'S GOING TO SAIL AWAY 
IT'LL SELL VERY WELL GOOD 
THERE IS TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN MEMORABILIA 
MORE AND MORE WE'RE FINDING THAT ALBUMS 
AND THINGS WITH AUTOGRAPHS ARE MAKING FAR MORE THAN WE ANTICIPATE 
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE COLLECTING THIS SORT OF THING 
SO I'VE NO HESITATION THIS IS GOING TO SELL VERY WELL 
SO THIS HAS ATTRACTED A LOT OF INTEREST IN THE ROOM 
IN THE ROOM AND ON THE INTERNET 
WHAT WOULD YOU SECRETLY LIKE TO KNOCK THIS OUT AT 
THE ESTIMATE IS ONE TO TWO ONE TO TWO 
IT'LL DOUBLE THAT AT LEAST 
REALLY SO WE COULD BE DOING FOUR HUNDRED 
IF I'M LOOKING AT THE TOP END EXACTLY EXACTLY RIGHT

LOVELY LITTLE PLATE SHOWING THE METHODIST CHURCH 
DATED GOT A VALUATION OF TWENTY TO THIRTY 
WHY ARE YOU FLOGGING THIS IT WAS PART OF MY DAD'S ESTATE
