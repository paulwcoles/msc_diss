ON OCTOBER TWELFTH NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN 
A DOG AND FIVE IRISHMEN SET SAIL FRO M. MALTA 
IN AN OLD RUSTY FREIGHTER 
THEIR DESTINATION LIBYA 
THE DOG WAS A PRESENT FOR THE LIBYAN SPY WHO'D ORGANISED THEIR CARGO 
ENOUGH WEAPONS TO FUEL THE I. R. A.'S WAR AGAINST THE BRITISH FOR DECADES TO COME 
IN THE AGE OF TERROR SOME CONFLICTS FEEL THEY MAY NEVER END 
THE VIOLENCE RELENTLESS THE COMBATANTS IRRECONCILABLE 
NEVER NEVER 
NEVER NEVER 
NEVER NEVER CHANGE 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN I SAW NO WAY OUT OF THIS NEVER NEVER LAND IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
BUT IN THE SPACE OF TEN DAYS I WATCHED TWO DRAMATIC EVENTS UNFOLD THAT WOULD PROVE ME WRONG 
THE FIRST WAS AN EYE OPENING REVELATION OF HOW ROGUE STATES SPONSORED TERRORISM 
THE SECOND WAS BRUTAL AND BLOODY A MASSACRE OF CIVILIANS 
THE DESECRATION OF A DAY SET ASIDE TO HONOUR THE DEAD 
THESE EVENTS COULD HAVE DRIVEN NORTHERN IRELAND INTO THE ABYSS 
INSTEAD IN WAYS THAT NOBODY COULD HAVE PREDICTED 
THEY WOULD MARK A BEGINNING OF THE LONG ROAD TO PEACE 
ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE THIRTIETH OF OCTOBER NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN 
A FRENCH CUSTOMS PATROL SPOTTED A SUSPICIOUS SHIP OFF THE COAST OF BRITTANY 
THEY SUSPECTED IT MIGHT BE RUNNING DRUGS AND DECIDED TO INTERCEPT 
THE SHIP WAS CALLED THE EKSUND AND WHEN THEY BOARDED 
THE FRENCH WERE SURPRISED TO DISCOVER IT HAD AN IRISH CREW 
THEY WERE EVEN MORE SURPRISED BY WHAT THEY FOUND BELOW DECKS 
A BOOBY TRAPPED CARGO 
IT SINKS SHE SINKS 
AND WHEN THEY FOUND WHAT WAS IN THE HOLD THEY WERE FLABBERGASTED 
AROUND THE SAME TIME IN A SAFE HOUSE ON THE LONELY BORDER 
BETWEEN NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE IRISH REPUBLIC 
THE I. R. A. WAS PUTTING THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO YET ANOTHER BOMB 
GROWING UP IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
YOU HEAR A POLICEMAN BEING SHOT EVERY WEEK 
OR A BOMB HAPPENING THERE AND IT WAS VERY 
YOU BECOME VERY NUMB TO IT ALL YOU JUST THINK OH THERE'S ANOTHER KILLING 
AND YOU JUST GET ON WITH LIFE 
BUT THIS BOMB WAS DIFFERENT 
NOT ONLY WOULD IT SHATTER THE LIVES OF THOSE CAUGHT IN ITS TERRIBLE BLAST 
IT WOULD ALSO MARK A TURNING POINT ON THE LONG ROAD TO PEACE 
IN BREST HARBOUR THE EKSUND WAS GIVING UP ITS DEADLY SECRETS 
NOT DRUGS BUT A VAST ARSENAL OF STATE OF THE ART WEAPONRY 
HIGH EXPLOSIVES GUNS AMMUNITION AND MISSILES 
THE FRENCH HAD NO IDEA WHERE THEY CAME FROM OR WHO THEY WERE FOR 
IN THE NEXT TEN DAYS THE MYSTERY OF THE EKSUND WOULD UNFOLD 
WITH FAR REACHING REPERCUSSIONS FOR BRITAIN'S WAR AGAINST THE I. R. A. 
MEANWHILE IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
AN I. R. A. UNIT WAS NOW RECCEING A SAFE ROUTE FOR THEIR BOMB THROUGH THE BYWAYS OF COUNTY FERMANAGH 
IT WAS NO EASY TASK THE WINDING LANES WERE HEAVILY PATROLLED BY THE BRITISH ARMY 
ONE OF ITS ROLES WAS TO PROTECT REMOTE PROTESTANT COMMUNITIES FROM I. R. A. ATTACK 
THE I. R. A. STRATEGY WAS BASICALLY TO 
MAKE THAT PART OF FERMANAGH UNGOVERNABLE UN BRITISH 
A CLAIM OF TERRITORY 
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THAT STRATEGY 
WELL I THINK IN HUMAN RIGHTS TERMS IT WAS A STRATEGY OF GENOCIDE 
THE TARGET FOR THIS PARTICULAR I. R. A. BOMB COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN MORE PROVOCATIVE 
THE EMOTIONALLY CHARGED REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY PARADE IN FERMANAGH'S COUNTY TOWN ENNISKILLEN 
OH DEAR GOD MOVE 
LOOKING THROUGH MY DIARIES OF THE LAST THIRTY YEARS I'VE WATCHED THE I. R. A. 
BUILD ITSELF INTO ONE OF THE MOST LETHAL AND RESILIENT INSURGENT GROUPS IN THE WORLD 
BY THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES IT HAD COMMITTED VOLUNTEERS 
A DISCIPLINED MILITARY LEADERSHIP AND A WELL THOUGHT OUT PLAN OF ACTION 
THE I. R. A.'S STRATEGY WAS TO WAGE A WAR OF ATTRITION THAT WOULD FINALLY DRIVE BRITAIN OUT OF THE NORTH 
THEY CALLED THEIR STRATEGY THE LONG WAR 
WE WILL EVENTUALLY SAP THE POLITICAL WILL OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO REMAIN IN IRELAND 
BUT THE WAR WOULD ALSO BE FOUGHT ON ANOTHER FRONT 
THE LONG TERM AIM WAS TO MAKE THE I. R. A.'S POLITICAL WING SINN FEIN 
A DOMINANT FORCE IN IRISH POLITICS 
THE STRATEGY WAS DEVISED BY GERRY ADAMS AND HIS INNER CIRCLE 
ONE OF THEM WAS DANNY MORRISON 
TWENTY YEARS AGO I REMEMBER QUOTING HIS WORDS THAT ECHOED THROUGH HISTORY 
WHO HERE WILL OBJECT HE SAID IF WITH A BALLOT PAPER IN THIS HAND 
AND THE ARMALITE IN THIS HAND WE TAKE POWER IN IRELAND 
THUS THE COURSE WAS SET 
THE LONG WAR WAS TO BE WAGED ON TWO FRONTS THE MILITARY AND THE POLITICAL 
THROUGH THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
I NOTED SINN FEIN'S ADVANCES AT THE BALLOT BOX 
BUT SINN FEIN WAS STILL VERY MUCH THE JUNIOR PARTNER OF THE I. R. A. 
WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT WINNING ELECTIONS 
AND WINNING ANY AMOUNT OF VOTES WILL BRING FREEDOM 
AT THE END OF THE DAY 
IT WILL BE THE CUTTING EDGE OF I. R. A. WHICH WILL BRING FREEDOM 
MARTIN MCGUINNESS IS NOW NORTHERN IRELAND'S DEPUTY FIRST MINISTER 
BUT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN HIS FIRST ALLEGIANCE WAS TO THE I. R. A. 
BUT THE I. R. A. LEADERSHIP KNEW THAT THE LONG WAR COULD ONLY LAST AS LONG AS IT HAD THE RESOURCES TO FIGHT IT 
THE BRITISH KNEW THIS TOO 
THEIR AIM TO STRANGLE THE I. R. A.'S SUPPLY LINES OF CASH AND MODERN WEAPONRY 
THEY NEVER IMAGINED THAT 
IT COULD ESCALATE THE CONFLICT AND CARRY ON FIGHTING INDEFINITELY 
WHERE WOULD THE MONEY COME FROM 
WHO WOULD SUPPLY THE ARMS 
AND HOW COULD SUCH AN OPERATION BE CARRIED OUT WITHOUT THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES GETTING WIND OF IT 
THE ANSWERS WERE ABOUT TO BE REVEALED 
THE SKIPPER OF THE EKSUND WAS NOW BEHIND BARS IN THE PORT OF BREST 
FRENCH CUSTOMS BEGAN THEIR INTERVIEWS 
THIS DRAMATISATION IS BASED ON TRANSCRIPTS OF WHAT HE SAID 
MY NAME IS ADRIAN JOHN HOPKINS 
I'M A MARRIED MAN WITH FOUR KIDS AND I HOLD AN IRISH PASSPORT 
I'M A MANAGER OF SEVERAL COMPANIES WHICH DEAL IN COMMERCIAL VESSELS 
NOW IN THIS CONTEXT A PERSON I HAVE KNOWN FOR SOME TIME 
NAMELY HENRY CAIRNS HE CONTACTED ME ABOUT FEBRUARY OR MARCH OF THIS YEAR 
OFFERED ME SOME BUSINESS 
HE TOLD ME THAT HE KNEW OF 
THAT CARGO SHIP WAS THE EKSUND NOW SEIZED AND DOCKED IN BREST HARBOUR 
ADRIAN HOPKINS ALREADY HAD A COLOURFUL HISTORY WITH THE IRISH POLICE 
HE'D ONCE OWNED A HORSE DRAWN TOURIST BUSINESS 
BUT THE WHEELS CAME OFF THAT VENTURE WHEN ITS OFFICES MYSTERIOUSLY WENT UP IN FLAMES 
HE THEN SET UP A TRAVEL AGENCY 
IT WENT BUST LEAVING CUSTOMERS HIGH AND DRY 
HIS FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES GREW AND BY THE MID EIGHTIES HE GRASPED A POTENTIAL LIFEBELT 
BUYING SELLING AND DELIVERING BOATS 
BUT THE EKSUND HAD SCUPPERED HIM 
HOPKINS WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE FIVE IRISHMEN TO SPILL THE BEANS 
HE EXPLAINED HOW HE'D BOUGHT THE EKSUND AND DELIVERED IT TO MALTA TO A MAN CALLED HENRY CAIRNS 
IN MALTA I MET CAIRNS AND THREE MEN 
WHO WERE THE CREW IN A HOTEL ROOM BUT THERE WAS NO CAPTAIN 
THEY SAID HE WASN'T AVAILABLE AND ASKED IF I WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE 
SO I AGREED 
TWO HOURS OUT TO SEA 
ONE OF THE MEN JAMES BOYLE CAME TO ME AND SAID THAT 
HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES WERE MEMBERS OF THE PROVISIONAL I. R. A. 
BOYLE MADE ME TWO OFFERS 
ONE THAT I WOULD BE VERY WELL PAID 
AND THE OTHER WAS THAT MY FAMILY WOULD BE SAFE 
I TOOK THAT AS A PHYSICAL THREAT TO MY FAMILY 
MEANWHILE IN COUNTY FERMANAGH THE I. R. A. CONTINUED PREPARATIONS 
FOR ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS ATTACKS OF ITS LONG WAR 
THEY WERE MOVING EVER CLOSER TO THEIR HIGHLY SENSITIVE TARGET 
THE REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY PARADE IN ENNISKILLEN 
FOR THE TOWN'S PROTESTANT COMMUNITY 
REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY WAS A SPECIAL DAY WITH SPECIAL FAMILY MEMORIES 
WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG 
MY FATHER ATTENDED REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY EVERY YEAR 
HE LOST HIS LEG IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR 
AND REMEMBRANCE DAY WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO HIM 
THE REGIMENTS THEN RAISED IN ULSTER SUFFERED STAGGERING LOSSES 
TWO THOUSAND WERE LOST ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME 
BUT FOR MEN LIKE SAMUEL GAULT WHO'D SERVED IN THE ROYAL ULSTER CONSTABULARY 
THE EMOTIONAL POWER OF REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY WAS NOT CONFINED TO THE PAST 
IT WAS NEARLY A FAMILY PILGRIMAGE 
MOST YEARS I REMEMBER GOING TO THE REMEMBRANCE DAY PARADE 
IT WAS JUST LIKE A COMMEMORATION 
NOT JUST FOR THE WORLD WARS 
BUT ACTUALLY TO COMMEMORATE THE MANY COLLEAGUES OF MY FATHER THAT WERE MURDERED DURING THE TROUBLES 
IN FRANCE ON THE FIRST DAY OF HIS INTERROGATION 
ADRIAN HOPKINS GAVE HIS INTERROGATORS A SURPRISING PIECE OF INFORMATION 
HE REVEALED WHERE HIS I. R. A. CUSTOMERS HAD TOLD HIM TO TAKE THE EKSUND 
BOYLE CAME TO ME AND SAID THAT THEY WERE ON A MISSION 
NAMELY TO GO TO LIBYA 
THE OIL RICH SANDS OF LIBYA WERE THE HOME OF THE OSAMA BIN LADEN OF THE DAY 
A MAN PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN CALLED THE MAD DOG OF THE MIDDLE EAST COLONEL MUAMMAR GADDAFI 
GADDAFI WAS USING HIS PETRODOLLARS TO FUEL REVOLUTIONARY TERRORISM 
AROUND THE WORLD AND THE I. R. A. WAS ONE OF HIS FAVOURITE CUSTOMERS 
THE RELATIONSHIP STRETCHED WAY BACK TO THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
GADDAFI MADE NO SECRET OF HIS SUPPORT FOR THE I. R. A.'S SO CALLED LIBERATION STRUGGLE 
WE BELIEVE THEY HAVE JUST CAUSE 
BECAUSE IRISH IS IRISH AND BRITAIN IS BRITAIN 
WE CONSIDER THE EXISTENCE OF BRITAIN IN THE NORTH OF IRELAND 
AS A KIND OF IMPERIALISM 
BY THE MID EIGHTIES GADDAFI'S RELATIONSHIP WITH BRITAIN HAD HIT ROCK BOTTOM 
FIRST A BRITISH POLICE OFFICER YVONNE FLETCHER 
WAS SHOT DEAD WHILST PATROLLING A DEMONSTRATION OUTSIDE THE LIBYAN EMBASSY IN LONDON 
THE SHOT CAME FROM INSIDE THE BUILDING 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WERE SEVERED 
THEN WHEN U. S. WAR PLANES BOMBED LIBYA IN RETALIATION 
FOR SUPPORT OF TERRORISM THE F. ONE HUNDRED ELEVENS TOOK OFF FROM BRITISH BASES 
AND NOW MORE THAN EVER GADDAFI'S ENEMY'S ENEMY BECAME HIS FRIEND 
HE HAD SUPPLIED ARMS TO THE I. R. A. BEFORE BUT NOW BEGAN TO DO SO ON A MASSIVE SCALE 
AND AT NO COST WHATSOEVER TO THE I. R. A. 
THIS WAS STATE SPONSORSHIP OF TERRORISM OF THE MOST CALCULATED AND DEADLY KIND 
WE DOCKED BETWEEN WARSHIPS 
TWO TRAILERS ARRIVED AND LIBYAN SOLDIERS FORMED A CHAIN TO UNLOAD THE CARGO ONTO THE EKSUND 
ONE OF THE SOLDIERS ASKED ME IF I WANTED ARMS AS WELL AS THE AMMUNITION 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY JUST TO GET OUT OF THE SITUATION SO I SAID YES 
HE OFFERED ME VARIOUS ARMS 
MORTARS A. K. FORTY SEVENS 
FLAME THROWERS AND SURFACE TO AIR MISSILES 
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT WE RETURNED AND ONE HUNDRED MORE BOXES WERE LOADED 
AND WE SET SAIL FOR THE IRISH SEA 
WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO THE SEIZURE OF THE EKSUND 
ONE OF SURPRISE I THINK 
AND INITIALLY OF RELIEF 
BECAUSE HERE A LARGE SUPPLY OF ARMS HAD BEEN SEIZED 
AND ALL THESE ROCKETS AND SEMTEX EXPLOSIVE 
AND SMALL ARMS HAD BEEN SEIZED 
AND WERE NOT THEREFORE GOING TO BE USED IN THE WAR BY THE I. R. A. 
A SENSE OF JUBILATION IN TERMS OF A CAPTURE LIKE THAT BEING MADE 
AND THE BLOW IT WOULD STRIKE AT THE PROVISIONAL I. R. A. 
IN TERMS OF EQUIPPING ITSELF 
IN FRANCE THE QUESTIONING OF ADRIAN HOPKINS SKIPPER OF THE EKSUND CONTINUED 
IT WAS DAY TWO OF HIS INTERROGATION 
DID I KNOW THE EKSUND WAS TO DELIVER ARMS CERTAINLY NOT 
I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO KNOWLEDGE OF IT 
MEANWHILE AS HOPKINS STARTED TO SING IN FRANCE ALONG THE IRISH BORDER 
PREPARATIONS FOR THE ENNISKILLEN ATTACK WERE ALMOST COMPLETE 
THE OPERATION WAS COMPLEX AND TIGHTLY CO ORDINATED 
IT WAS AN ORGANISED EFFORT BETWEEN A NUMBER OF UNITS 
NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE BORDER 
HOW MANY UNITS 
WE SUSPECT POSSIBLY THREE UNITS INVOLVED WHICH WERE 
WE BELIEVE THAT THE SOUTH EAST FERMANAGH UNIT 
WITH SOME ASSISTANCE FROM MONAGHAN PROVIDED THE ELECTRONIC TIMER 
DONEGAL SOUTH WEST FERMANAGH PREPARED THE BOMB 
ACCORDING TO BRITISH AND IRISH INTELLIGENCE SOURCES 
THE PLANNED ATTACK WASN'T THE WORK OF RENEGADE I. R. A. UNITS 
AN OPERATION AGAINST SUCH AN ICONIC AND EMOTIONAL TARGET AND INVOLVING UNITS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER 
COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT WITH SANCTION FROM ON HIGH 
AND THAT MEANT A GREEN LIGHT FROM THE MEN 
WHO RAN THE LONG WAR IN THE NORTH THE I. R. A.'S NORTHERN COMMAND 
DID NORTHERN COMMAND APPROVE THE ATTACKS 
NORTHERN COMMAND HAD A KNOWLEDGE OF THE ATTACK PRIOR TO IT TAKING PLACE 
WHICH MEANS THEY GAVE THEIR APPROVAL TO IT PRESUMABLY 
IF THEY HAD KNOWLEDGE OF IT 
THEY DIDN'T STOP IT 
I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED IF THEY WERE NOT AWARE THAT ATTACKS 
WERE GOING TO BE CARRIED ON CERTAIN CENTRES TOWNS OR TARGETS 
SO IN ESSENCE I WOULD BE SURPRISED 
IF THEY WEREN'T AWARE THERE WAS TO BE AN ATTACK IN ENNISKILLEN 
LEADING REPUBLICANS CHALLENGE THIS VIEW 
FORMER I. R. A. PRISONER DANNY MORRISON WAS SINN FEIN'S DIRECTOR OF PUBLICITY AT THE TIME 
I DON'T BELIEVE THE ATTACK WAS ORGANISED BY OR SANCTIONED 
OR THAT THE LEADERSHIP OF THE REPULICAN MOVEMENT WAS PRIVY TO IT 
BUT IF YOU HAVE DIFFERENT I. R. A. UNITS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER 
INVOLVED IN THIS OPERATION 
THAT MUST IMPLY THAT IT WAS SANCTIONED AT HIGH LEVEL 
YOU'RE SAYING THIS AND I'VE SAID HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS 
WHEN I ASK YOU YOU SAY YOU CAN'T TELL ME 
ARE YOU SAYING IT'S NOT TRUE 
I'M SAYING I DON'T KNOW 
HOW CAN I COMMENT 
BRITISH AND IRISH INTELLIGENCE SOURCES BOTH TOLD ME THAT THE LEADING FIGURE ON NORTHERN COMMAND 
AT THE TIME WAS MARTIN MCGUINNESS NOW NORTHERN IRELAND'S DEPUTY FIRST MINISTER 
I PUT THIS TO MR. MCGUINNESS 
HE SAID HE WAS NOT A MEMBER OF NORTHERN COMMAND 
AND HAD NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF ENNISKILLEN 
NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED MILES AWAY ON THE THIRD DAY OF HIS INTERROGATION 
ADRIAN HOPKINS FINALLY DROPPED ANY PRETENCE THAT HE WAS AN INNOCENT ABROAD 
ACTUALLY UP UNTIL NOW I HAVEN'T BEEN TELLING YOU THE TRUTH 
BECAUSE I FEAR FOR MY LIFE 
THE ACTUAL FACTS ARE AS FOLLOWS 
THREE YEARS AGO CAIRNS WHO I KNEW CONTACTED ME 
I THOUGHT HE WAS I. R. A. 
HE SUGGESTED WE USE A YACHT I OWNED TO TRANSPORT ARMS FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN 
DUE TO MY FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY AT THE TIME I AGREED 
AS I WAS BEING PAID AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY 
THROUGH CAIRNS I MET A MAN CALLED MALACHY 
WE DISCUSSED THE CONDITIONS 
FIVE TONS OF ARMS TO BE TRANSPORTED 
IN RETURN I WOULD BE PAID ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
WHY DO YOU THINK ADRIAN HOPKINS DID IT 
A NEED 
A NEED FOR WHAT I'D SAY FOR MONEY 
NOT THROUGH ANY COMMITMENT TO THE I. R. A.'S CAUSE 
I DON'T THINK SO I DON'T THINK SO 
ADRIAN HOPKINS NOW DROPPED A BOMBSHELL THAT WAS TO MAKE THE BRITS' HAIR STAND ON END 
THE EKSUND WAS NOT THE ONLY VESSEL HE'D SAILED TO LIBYA 
HE REVEALED THAT OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS 
HE'D ALREADY LANDED FOUR OTHER LIBYAN SHIPMENTS IN IRELAND 
IN ALL DURING THESE FOUR VOYAGES 
BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TONS OF ARMS AND AMMUNITION WERE BROUGHT INTO THE COUNTRY 
THE CARGO WAS UNLOADED ON THE IRISH COAST 
AT A PLACE CALLED CLOGGA STRAND 
THIS WAS AN INTELLIGENCE FAILURE OF MONUMENTAL PROPORTIONS 
HOW COULD FOUR SHIPMENTS HAVE SLIPPED THROUGH THE NET 
BRITISH AND IRISH INTELLIGENCE HAD UTTERLY FAILED TO CLOCK HOPKINS 
AND HIS REGULAR COMMUTE TO LIBYA 
AND THERE WERE SOME GLARING CLUES 
IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AFTER HOPKINS' FIRST TRIP 
THE IRISH POLICE HAD UNCOVERED TWO ARMS DUMPS 
IN THOSE TWO SEARCHES WERE FOUND 
OVER EIGHTY A. K. FORTY SEVENS AND OTHER WEAPONRY 
PISTOLS I THINK WERE ALSO FOUND IN THOSE TWO SEARCHES 
BUT ONE CLEAR ISSUE IN ALL OF THIS IS THAT THERE WAS A BOX WHICH SAID 
LIBYAN ARMY WEAPONRY OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT 
WHICH WAS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT THEY HAD COME AT SOME STAGE FROM LIBYA 
IT SAID LIBYAN ARMED FORCES I THINK 
THAT'S FAIRLY SPECIFIC ISN'T IT LIBYAN ARMED FORCES 
SO I DO THINK AND I THINK WE'VE ALL ACCEPTED 
THAT IT WAS A SERIOUS BREAKDOWN 
IN OUR INTELLIGENCE GATHERING SYSTEM AT THE TIME 
THAT'S PROBABLY AN UNDERSTATEMENT AN UNDERSTATEMENT 
IN THE COURSE OF MY RESEARCH I'VE SEEN AN INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENT 
IT'S MARKED SECRET AND PERSONAL 
IT REVEALS THE SCALE OF THE WEAPONRY THAT ADRIAN HOPKINS HAD ALREADY 
LANDED IN IRELAND BEFORE THE INTERCEPTION OF THE EKSUND 
THE ARSENAL INCLUDED THIRTY SIX ROCKET LAUNCHERS TEN SAM SEVENS 
TWENTY SIX HEAVY MACHINE GUNS HUNDREDS OF RIFLES 
THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION OVER TWO HUNDRED GRENADES 
TEN FLAME THROWERS 
AND ENOUGH SEMTEX EXPLOSIVE TO BLOW THINGS UP FOR YEARS TO COME 
THE SECRET DOCUMENT ALSO REVEALS 
THAT THE LIBYANS PAID AROUND TEN MILLION 
INTO THE I. R. A.'S COFFERS ALL IN CASH 
FOR THE BRITISH THIS TRANSLATED INTO MORE DEAD SOLDIERS 
MORE DEAD POLICEMEN AND MORE DEAD BYSTANDERS 
AND A NIGHTMARE THAT COULD ENDURE FOR YEARS 
THERE WAS A REACTION OF ALARM WHEN WE DISCOVERED 
THAT THIS WAS NOT THE ONLY SHIPMENT AND THAT THERE HAD BEEN PREVIOUS SHIPMENTS 
AND SO THERE WAS A LARGE ARSENAL HIDDEN SOMEWHERE 
IN THE REPUBLIC OR WHEREVER WHICH COULD BE USED BY THE I. R. A. 
SO THE LONG WAR IN THE MILITARY SENSE 
COULD GO ON FOR A VERY LONG TIME 
DID THAT SHOCK YOU YES 
THE SENSE OF JUBILATION IN TERMS OF THE INTERCEPTION OF THE EKSUND 
CHANGED VERY VERY QUICKLY TO A COLD SENSE OF REALISATION 
YOU MAY HAVE GOT THE EKSUND 
BUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY PLUS TONS OF WEAPONRY HAVE ALREADY 
COME INTO THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND FOR USE BY THE I. R. A. 
IT BECAME QUITE CLEAR TO I. R. A. VOLUNTEERS ON THE GROUND THAT 
THE I. R. A. HAS SUCCESSFULLY LANDED AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF ARMS 
AND THAT IT HAD ENOUGH SUPPLY POSSIBLY TO MAINTAIN THE ARMED STRUGGLE AT A FAIR TEMPO 
FOR POSSIBLY THE NEXT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
AS THE BRITISH CAME TO TERMS WITH THE ENORMITY OF HOPKINS' REVELATIONS 
THE ENNISKILLEN OPERATION WAS NEARING ITS CLIMAX 
ON SATURDAY SEVENTH OF NOVEMBER 
THE FIFTY POUND BOMB WAS TAKEN TO ITS TARGET UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS 
WE BELIEVE THAT SOMETIME ON THE SATURDAY EARLY EVENING IT WAS MOVED TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF ENNISKILLEN 
SCOUTED IN BY MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL PROVISIONAL I. R. A. UNIT 
SCOUTED IN YES 
MEMBERS WOULD HAVE TAKEN POSITIONS ALONG THE ROUTE TO ENSURE THAT NO SECURITY FORCES WERE PRESENT 
A NUMBER OF LOCAL PROVISIONAL I. R. A. SYMPATHISERS WERE IN ENNISKILLEN 
DEPLOYED TO KEEP A LOOK OUT FOR MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES 
HAPPY AS LARRY 
TOWARDS MIDNIGHT THE CARETAKER OF A SOCIAL CLUB KNOWN AS THE READING ROOMS 
WAS PLAYING CARDS WITH A COUPLE OF FRIENDS BEFORE HE LOCKED UP 
AS THEY DEALT THE LAST HAND 
THEY THOUGHT THEY HEARD FAINT MUFFLED FOOTSTEPS UPSTAIRS 
THE BOMB WAS BEING PLACED AGAINST THE GABLE WALL OF THE BUILDING 
THE WALL LOOKED ONTO THE CENOTAPH WHERE THE WREATH LAYING CEREMONY WAS DUE TO START THE FOLLOWING MORNING 
THE ENNISKILLEN BOMB WAS A HOMEMADE EXPLOSIVE DEVICE 
CONSTRUCTED OF FERTILISER BASED EXPLOSIVE 
WHICH WAS PLACED WE BELIEVE AGAINST THE GABLE WALL 
WHICH ABUTTED THE FOOTPATH NEXT TO THE WAR MEMORIAL 
THE DETONATION WAS THROUGH USING AN ELECTRONIC TIMER 
SET TO GO OFF AT ONE THOUSAND FORTY THREE IN THE MORNING OF THE REMEMBRANCE DAY 
MY FIRST MEMORY OF THAT MORNING WAS WATCHING CRICKET ON MY T. V. 
AND MY MOTHER CAME INTO THE BEDROOM AND I SAID TO HER 
DO I HAVE TO GO THIS MORNING I DON'T REALLY WANT TO GO 
YOU'LL MAKE YOUR DAD HAPPY IF YOU GO SHE SAID 
WE'LL BOTH GO TOGETHER O. K. SO WE DID 
WE WERE HAVING A FAMILY DAY 
AND SERENA OUR YOUNGEST DAUGHTER 
HEAD GIRL OF THE SCHOOL SHE WAS THERE TO LAY THE WREATH 
MY HUSBAND AND MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER MARIE HAD PLANNED TO GO DOWN TO THE WAR MEMORIAL IN ENNISKILLEN 
I AS USUAL HAD PLANNED TO GO TO THE METHODIST CHURCH 
TO BEGIN PLAYING THE ORGAN BEFORE THE PARADE WOULD COME TO THE CHURCH 
WE SET OFF AS USUAL TO GO TO THE REMEMBRANCE DAY PARADE 
ME AND MY FATHER ACTUALLY WERE 
STANDING IN THE CROWD JUST TAKING IT ALL IN 
MEETING DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN 
YOU MIGHTN'T HAVE SEEN THEM FOR A YEAR 
BUT YOU'D ALWAYS BUMP INTO THEM ON REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY 
GORDON AND MARIE LEFT TO GO TO THE WAR MEMORIAL 
DO YOU REMEMBER SAYING GOODBYE TO HER THAT MORNING 
I REMEMBER IT VERY CLEARLY 
I WAS IN THE KITCHEN AND SHE CAME HURRYING THROUGH 
RUSHED OUT THE BACK DOOR AND SAID BYE MUM 
AND I CALLED AFTER HER AND SAID MARIE DO YOU HAVE AN UMBRELLA 
AND SHE SAID OF COURSE I HAVE MUM DON'T FUSS 
AS ELEVEN O'CLOCK DREW NEAR CROWDS GATHERED TO WATCH THE MILITARY BANDS PARADE AND THE WREATHS BEING LAID 
MANY TOOK UP THEIR FAVOURITE POSITION IN FRONT OF THE READING ROOMS' GABLE WALL 
TRADITIONALLY IT OFFERED THE BEST VIEW 
MY DAD ALWAYS LIKED THE POSITION 
IN FRONT OF THE READING ROOMS BEHIND THE FENCE THERE 
HE ALWAYS LIKED TO GET THERE EARLY BECAUSE THERE WAS THE BEST VANTAGE POINT TO SEE THE BANDS 
TO SEE THEM COMING DOWN THE ROAD 
MY DAUGHTER WAS LAYING THE WREATH AT THE CENOTAPH 
AND I WENT DOWN PARTICULARLY THIS MORNING TO TAKE HER PICTURE 
COULDN'T SEE WELL ENOUGH 
JIM COULDN'T GET GOOD ENOUGH PICTURES 
SO WE MOVED ROUND TO THE EDGE OF THE RAILING 
SO WE WERE THERE AT THE FRONT OF THE FENCE WITH ME AND MY DAD 
AND I WAS STANDING IN BETWEEN MY MOTHER ON MY LEFT AND MY DAD ON MY RIGHT 
AND AND THEN WE JUST WAITED THERE 
BAGPIPES PLAY 
THE LAST THING I SAID TO MY FATHER THERE WAS A POLICEMAN HAD ACTUALLY WALKED PAST US 
AND I HAD SAID TO MY FATHER WITH HIM BEING IN THE R. U. C. 
WHO WAS HE AND I NEVER GOT THE ANSWER 
I REMEMBER A CONVERSATION DAD SAID SOMETHING ABOUT UMBRELLAS 
I CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY DID YOU BRING YOUR UMBRELLA 
AND THEN JUST AT THAT SECOND 
THE BOMB EXPLODED 
I HAD JUST TIME TO THINK THAT IT'S AN EXPLOSION 
WHEN I WAS WHIPPED OFF MY FEET FLUNG INTO 
I KNEW I WAS IN MID AIR 
I KNEW I WAS GOING TO BE KILLED BECAUSE THE RUBBLE WAS FALLING 
I WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE RUBBLE FALLING ON MY HEAD 
A LARGE LUMP OF MASONRY HIT ME ON THE SIDE OF THE FACE 
ONCE I WAS HIT I WAS DOWN 
AND THE BUILDING FELL ON TOP OF ME AND CRUSHED ME 
WHAT I REMEMBER WAS LIFTING MY HEAD UP 
PUTTING MY HAND UP TO MY FACE 
AND THE BLOOD WAS COMING OUT OF ME AND I THOUGHT I'M BADLY INJURED 
I JUST REMEMBER ALL OF THE BRICKS AND THE DUST 
COMING RIGHT ON TOP OF ME ON MY BACK 
AND FEELING THIS HEAVY WEIGHT ON ME 
AND JUST I REMEMBER THINKING THIS IS AN I. R. A. BOMB 
THE EXPLOSION BLEW OUT THE GABLE WALL 
AND TONS OF MASONRY CRASHED ONTO THE BYSTANDERS BELOW 
I THINK ACTUALLY I MIGHT HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT FOR A FEW SECONDS 
BECAUSE WHEN I AWOKE OR CAME ROUND 
IT WAS JUST THE SILENCE THE DUST AND BEING BURIED TO THE KNEES 
AND THEN THERE SEEMED LIKE 
A SILENCE FOR A WHILE 
AND THEN ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE 
IT'S A SCENE OUT OF A MOVIE 
IT'S JUST PANDEMONIUM 
PEOPLE ARE RUNNING SCREAMING 
PEOPLE LYING INJURED ON THE GROUND PEOPLE BEING DRAGGED 
LUMPS OF MASONRY RUBBLE BEING PULLED OFF THEM 
ACTUALLY AT ONE POINT 
I SEEN TWO BODIES THAT WERE JUST BEING LAID OUT WITH COATS OVER THEM 
THEY UNFORTUNATELY WERE KILLED THEMSELVES 
SCREAMING SHRIEKING 
CRYING 
BROKEN GLASS 
DEBRIS FALLING ALL OVER THE SHOW 
PEOPLE REALLY SCREAMING FOR HELP 
GET BACK 
I STARTED TO SCREAM 
AND I KNEW I WAS SCREAMING AND I RAN LOOKING FOR JIM 
I WENT TO MY MOTHER WHO WAS 
UNDER THE RUBBLE LYING FLAT WITH HER ARMS AT THE SIDE JUST LIKE THAT 
I JUST TOOK ALL THE BRICKS OFF HER AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE 
JUST THREW THEM TO THE SIDE AND WAS DOING IT AS FRANTICALLY AS POSSIBLE 
AND FROM WHAT I'D SEEN OF HER I JUST KNEW SHE WAS DEAD 
I WOULDN'T LIKE TO DESCRIBE WHAT I'D SEEN 
BUT IT WAS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A HORROR MOVIE BASICALLY 
AND THE BLOOD WAS EVERYWHERE 
I BECAME A NUISANCE BECAUSE THE ARMY TOOK ME PUT THEIR ARMS ROUND ME 
AND TURNED ME AWAY FROM WHERE THEY WERE TRYING TO GET JIM OUT 
I REMEMBER SCREAMING AT THEM TO GET JIM OUT 
DO YOU REMEMBER BEING CONSCIOUS UNDER THE RUBBLE 
NO 
I JUST REMEMBER THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DARKNESS 
A TERRIBLE QUIETNESS 
THERE WAS A STILLNESS 
WHICH WAS UNSPEAKABLE 
WHAT CONDITION WAS JIM DIXON IN WHEN YOU SAW HIM 
WELL 
HE WAS JUST A FIGURE OF A MAN IN DISTRESS 
AND HE WAS A VICTIM 
AND I REMEMBER SCREAMING AT HIM 
JIM YOU'RE ALIVE AND I'M ALIVE 
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE WOULDN'T TALK TO ME 
WE WERE ALIVE 
BUT JIM WASN'T ANSWERING ME 
I TURNED RIGHT TO MY DAD AND HE HAD A CONCRETE SLAB PRESSED UP AGAINST HIM 
AGAINST THE RAILING 
AND IT WAS A VERY HEAVY CONCRETE SLAB AND I TRIED TO PUSH IT 
BUT THERE WAS NO BUDGING IT 
ALL OF HIS NERVE ENDINGS SHAKING 
AND I KNEW HE WAS DEAD AS WELL 
HE WAS JUST FACING ME WITH HIS EYES CLOSED 
MY FIRST IMMEDIATE REACTION WAS WHERE WAS MY FATHER 
AND WHEN I FOUND HIM HE WAS LYING AT MY FEET 
AND I KNEW BY LOOKING AT HIM THAT UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS KILLED 
HIS HEAD WAS ACTUALLY PUSHED THROUGH THE RAILINGS SO IT WAS LIKE 
AS IF YOU TOOK THE TOP OFF AN EGG 
WHERE HIS SKULL HAD JUST BEEN RIPPED OPEN 
SO WHEN I SEEN THAT I KNEW THAT THERE WAS HE WAS LIFELESS 
I WAS IN NORTHERN IRELAND AT THE TIME AND WENT STRAIGHT TO ENNISKILLEN THAT NIGHT 
I WAS BOTH SHATTERED AND PERPLEXED 
WHY WOULD THE I. R. A. CARRY OUT SUCH AN OPERATION 
DESECRATING REMEMBRANCE DAY 
EXPERIENCE TOLD ME THAT THE I. R. A. 
DID NOT DELIBERATELY TARGET CIVILIANS UNLIKE AL QAEDA TODAY 
IT JUST DIDN'T MAKE SENSE 
BUT AGAIN ACCORDING TO INTELLIGENCE REPORTS OF THE TIME 
THE I. R. A. LEADERSHIP WAS ALERT TO THE POSSIBILITY OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES THAT DAY 
HAVING REVIEWED ALL THE PAPERS RELATING TO ENNISKILLEN 
PRIOR TO THE BOMB 
THERE WAS DELIBERATIONS AT A VERY SENIOR LEVEL WITHIN THE MOVEMENT 
AND A CALCULATION WAS TAKEN AS TO THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES 
THAT THEY COULD INFLICT ON THE CIVILIAN POPULATION 
AGAINST THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES THEY COULD INFLICT 
ON MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES ATTENDING THE MEMORIAL 
AND THEY DECIDED THAT THE RISK WAS WORTH TAKING 
WERE CIVILIANS THE TARGET OF THE BOMB 
THE CIVILIANS WERE COLLATERAL TO THE BOMB 
BUT THEY WERE PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES AMONGST THE CIVILIANS 
BECAUSE THESE BORDER UNITS WERE GIVEN 
A DEGREE OF OPERATIONAL AUTONOMY BY NORTHERN COMMAND 
IT'S UNLIKELY THAT ITS LEADERSHIP WOULD HAVE KNOWN 
THAT THE POSITION OF THE BOMB WAS BOUND TO SLAUGHTER CIVILIANS 
I DON'T THINK THEY WENT OUT WITH THE INTENTION OF KILLING ELEVEN PEOPLE 
CIVILIANS AND SERIOUSLY INJURING FORTY 
THE TARGET MAY HAVE BEEN 
THE BRITISH SERVICE PEOPLE FORCES WHO WERE IN ATTENDANCE 
NEVERTHELESS THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT 
WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY PLANTED A BOMB IN THE CENTRE OF ENNISKILLEN AND THIS HAPPENED 
THE HORROR OF THE BOMB WAS GRADUALLY DAWNING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE TOWN 
REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN BEGAN AT THIS SIMPLE COLUMN IN WHITEHALL 
I WAS WATCHING THE CEREMONY FROM THE CENOTAPH IN LONDON 
AND I HEARD A CLICK 
WHICH WENT DIRECTLY ACROSS THE KITCHEN A VERY LOUD CLICK 
AND I THOUGHT WHAT WAS THAT 
I WENT ON WATCHING AND I DIDN'T REALISE WHAT IT WAS UNTIL MY SON 
CAME BACK AND CAME IN AND SAID DID YOU HEAR A NOISE A BANG 
AND I SAID I HEARD A CLICK 
AND HE SAID WELL IT'S A BOMB HAS GONE OFF DOWN TOWN 
AND HE SAID I SEE SMOKE RISING 
I THINK IT IS NEAR THE WAR MEMORIAL 
SO THAT SHOCKED ME BECAUSE I THOUGHT WELL 
GORDON AND MARIE ARE THERE I HOPE THAT NOTHING TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED 
THE LOCAL HOSPITAL WAS FLOODED WITH CASUALTIES AND ANXIOUS FAMILIES DESPERATE TO BE AT THEIR SIDE 
CUPS OF TEA EVERYWHERE YOU TURNED THERE WAS CUPS OF TEA 
IF THEY SAW YOU WITHOUT A CUP OF TEA THEY PUT ANOTHER CUP OF TEA IN YOUR HAND 
I'M SURE I HAD ONE HUNDRED CUPS OF TEA LYING ROUND THAT PLACE 
AND IT WAS THEN I REALISED 
MY COAT 
THE BUTTONS ARE GONE OFF MY COAT 
WHY ARE THE BUTTONS GONE OFF MY COAT 
THIS WAS A NEW COAT 
THE BUTTONS ARE GONE 
I HAVE BEEN IN THAT BOMB 
JIM DIXON WAS TAKEN INTO SURGERY WITH MASSIVE HEAD INJURIES 
I REMEMBER SAYING TO THE SURGEON 
PLEASE HIT ME OVER THE HEAD WITH A HATCHET 
I CAN'T STAND IT 
I FELT 
AS IF I WAS DRAGGED INTO 
THE TERROR WAS SO REAL 
IT WAS SUFFOCATING ME WITH PURE FEAR 
WE TRAVELLED QUICKLY TO THE HOSPITAL 
AND I KEPT ASKING PETER MY SON WHERE IS MARIE 
WE'VE HEARD THAT YOUR FATHER HAS A BROKEN ARM BUT WHERE IS MARIE 
AND HE SAID I DON'T KNOW 
WE WERE BROUGHT TO GORDON'S BEDSIDE 
HE WAS SITTING UP WITH HIS SHOULDER STRAPPED 
AND MY DAUGHTER WAS BESIDE ME AND MY SON 
AND THE SPECIALIST WANTED TO SPEAK TO US 
AND HE EXPLAINED TO US THAT MARIE WAS IN THEATRE 
NOW SHE HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED OR HER JEWELLERY HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED 
BY MY SON AND DAUGHTER 
I WAS SITTING THERE BY MYSELF THINKING YOU KNOW 
WHAT'S GOING ON 
I ACCEPTED AT THAT POINT FROM WHAT I HAD SEEN 
THAT THERE WAS NO WAY THAT MY MOTHER COULD HAVE LIVED 
AND I KNEW MY DAD WAS DEAD AS WELL 
I KIND OF ACCEPTED IT AT THAT POINT 
I WASN'T IN DENIAL ABOUT IT OH MAYBE THEY'LL STILL BE ALIVE 
I JUST KNEW AT THAT POINT THEY WERE DEAD I WAS KIND OF 
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO BASICALLY I WAS THINKING 
TO SEE MARIE ON THE BED WIRED UP 
I TOOK HER HAND AND IT WAS COLD 
AND I THINK I STAMMERED 
HER HAND IS COLD 
WE'VE KEPT THE MACHINE GOING BUT HER HEART IS BEATING BUT ONLY JUST 
AS WE STOOD THERE WATCHING HER LIFE EBBING AWAY 
IT EBBED AWAY AND SHE PASSED OVER TO OUR HEAVENLY FATHER IN OUR PRESENCE 
DID YOU SAY GOODBYE 
YES IN MY OWN WAY I TOUCHED HER 
AND I WAS SO STUNNED 
I DON'T THINK I SAID 
GOODBYE LOUDLY 
BUT I SAID IT IN MY HEART 
AND I DO NOT REMEMBER LEAVING THAT ROOM UNTIL I REACHED GORDON 
AND HE SAID WHAT ABOUT MARIE 
AND I SAID MARIE'S GONE 
ELEVEN PEOPLE DIED AS A RESULT OF THE ENNISKILLEN BOMB 
ALL WERE CIVILIANS ALL WERE PROTESTANTS 
THE DAY AFTER THE BOMBING MARIE WILSON'S FATHER GORDON 
GAVE A REMARKABLE INTERVIEW THAT ECHOED AROUND THE WORLD 
WE WERE THERE TEN FIFTEEN SECONDS AT THE OUTSIDE 
BANG 
AND WE WERE PUSHED FORWARD ON OUR FACES THAT WAS MY SENSATION 
I COULD SPEAK AND I COULD MOVE TO SOME EXTENT BUT I COULDN'T GET UP I WAS PINNED 
AND THEN I WAS AWARE OF SOMEBODY SQUEEZING MY HAND 
MARIE SAID IS THAT YOU DAD AND I SAID YES 
SHE SAID ARE YOU ALL RIGHT 
I SAID YES BUT MY HAND'S SORE 
HOW ARE YOU DEAR ALL RIGHT 
THEN I HEARD HER SCREAM 
I ASKED HER AGAIN HOW ARE YOU MARIE 
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT YES 
SHE WAS GRIPPING MY HAND VERY TIGHTLY 
I WAS BLEEDING FROM THE FOREHEAD 
I KNEW I'D HURT MYSELF 
BUT I WAS ASSURED THAT SHE WAS ALL RIGHT SHE'D TOLD ME TWICE 
SHE TOLD ME AGAIN BUT SHE STILL WAS SCREAMING IN BETWEEN TIMES 
AND I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY ON THE ONE HAND 
SHE WAS TELLING ME SHE WAS ALL RIGHT 
AND ON THE OTHER HAND SHE WAS SCREAMING 
WHEN I ASKED HER FOR THE FOURTH OR FIFTH TIME 
SHE SAID DADDY I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH 
THOSE WERE THE LAST WORDS SHE SPOKE 
I SHALL NEVER FORGET THEM 
BUT I BEAR NO ILL WILL TO ANYBODY 
YOU SAY THAT YOU BEAR NO ONE ANY ILL WILL 
IT MUST BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR YOU NOT TO FEEL BITTER TOWARDS 
THOSE WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR LEAVING THAT BOMB 
I HAVEN'T REALLY HAD TIME TO THINK OF THE WIDER IMPLICATIONS 
CERTAINLY DON'T FEEL BITTERNESS 
PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED THAT I DON'T BUT I DON'T 
I PRAYED FOR THEM LAST NIGHT 
SINCERELY 
AND I HOPE I GET THE GRACE TO CONTINUE TO DO SO 
INCREDIBLY THE BLOODSHED IN THE BORDER COUNTRY COULD HAVE BEEN EVEN WORSE 
AS THE DUST SETTLED IT BECAME KNOWN THAT ENNISKILLEN WAS NOT THE ONLY PARADE IN THE I. R. A.'S SIGHTS 
A CROSS BORDER UNIT HAD ALSO TARGETED A POPPY DAY CEREMONY 
JUST TWENTY MILES AWAY IN A TINY BORDER VILLAGE CALLED TULLYHOMMON 
THE TARGET AT TULLYHOMMON WOULD HAVE BEEN 
THE BOYS BRIGADE THE GIRLS BRIGADE AND THE BAND 
AND A SMALL NUMBER THREE OR FOUR MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES 
WHO IN UNIFORM WERE THERE TO LAY A WREATH 
BUT THE BOYS BRIGADE AND THE GIRLS BRIGADE CONSISTS OF LITTLE CHILDREN FROM THE AGE OF SIX UPWARDS 
YES BUT IN THE EYES OF THE PROVISIONAL I. R. A. THEY WERE LEGITIMATE TARGETS 
THE PURPOSE OF THE ATTACK WAS TO ATTACK THE REMEMBRANCE DAY 
THE ESTABLISHMENT AND THE COMMUNITY IN FERMANAGH 
THE BOMB WAS FOUR TIMES THE SIZE 
OF THE ENNISKILLEN DEVICE BUT IT DIDN'T GO OFF 
A TRACTOR IS SAID TO HAVE DRIVEN OVER THE COMMAND WIRE 
THUS PREVENTING CARNAGE THAT MAY HAVE ECLIPSED ENNISKILLEN 
BUT ENNISKILLEN WAS MORE THAN ENOUGH 
TO CREATE A UNIVERSAL WAVE OF ANGER AND DISGUST 
IT WAS SO APPALLING REALLY I COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE IT 
BECAUSE ANYONE WHO WOULD DO SUCH A TERRIBLE THING 
WOULD BE CONDEMNED THE WORLD OVER BY EVERY NATION 
AND I HOPE THAT WILL HAPPEN AND NO HELP TO THEM 
NO MATTER IF ANY COUNTRY'S HAD SYMPATHY WITH THEM BEFORE 
NO HELP TO THEM NOW NOT EVER 
MRS. THATCHER'S CONDEMNATION FOUND AN ECHO IN AN UNEXPECTED PLACE 
LIBYA'S OFFICIAL PRESS ASSOCIATION ISSUED ITS OWN DENUNCIATION 
LIBYA IS AWARE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LEGITIMATE REVOLUTIONARY ACTION 
AND TERRORISM AIMED AT CIVILIANS AND INNOCENT PEOPLE 
THIS ACTION DOES NOT BELONG TO THE LEGITIMATE REVOLUTIONARY OPERATIONS 
ONLY A COUPLE OF WEEKS EARLIER GADDAFI'S HENCHMEN HAD BEEN CRAMMING 
ADRIAN HOPKINS' SHIP WITH WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES ARMING THE I. R. A. TO ITS TEETH 
NOW LIBYA WAS CONDEMNING THEM FOR THEIR CALLOUS ATTACK 
FOR THE I. R. A. AND SINN FEIN ENNISKILLEN WAS BECOMING THE MOTHER OF ALL P. R. DISASTERS 
AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING 
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IRISH AMERICANS 
WHO HAVEN'T BEEN BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY IN TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS 
COME UP TO ME AND TALK ABOUT THE RESISTANCE 
THE REVOLUTION BACK HOME 
AND THE GLORY OF THE REVOLUTION AND THE GLORY OF DYING FOR THE REVOLUTION 
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THE GLORY OF KILLING FOR THE REVOLUTION WHERE'S THE GLORY IN THAT 
WHERE'S THE GLORY IN BOMBING A REMEMBRANCE DAY PARADE OF OLD AGE PENSIONERS 
THEIR MEDALS TAKEN OUT AND POLISHED UP FOR THE DAY 
WHERE'S THE GLORY IN THAT 
TO LEAVE THEM DYING OR CRIPPLED FOR LIFE OR DEAD UNDER THE RUBBLE 
FOR THE REVOLUTION 
YEARS OF REPUBLICAN PROPAGANDA PORTRAYING THE I. R. A.'S WAR 
AS A LIBERATION STRUGGLE WERE WIPED OUT BY ONE BOMB 
REPUBLICAN LEADERS WERE RATTLED AS NEVER BEFORE 
WELL I JUST FOUND IT DEVASTATING THAT ANYONE SHOULD ATTACK 
A COMMEMORATION FOR THE DEAD 
TO FIND THAT THE I. R. A. WAS INVOLVED I WAS SHATTERED 
AS I THINK MANY OF OUR SUPPORTERS WERE 
THE POLITICAL MANDARINS WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN MOVEMENT 
HAD FOR THE FIRST TIME TO DEAL WITH A VERY NEGATIVE EFFECT 
HOW DO YOU DRESS UP THE MURDER OF CIVILIANS 
THE MURDER OF A YOUNG STUDENT NURSE 
THE MURDER OF PEOPLE AT PRAYER 
HOW DO YOU DRESS THAT UP AS PART OF A LEGITIMATE WAR 
AND THE REALITY WAS IT COULDN'T BE 
IN THIS ATMOSPHERE OF CRISIS 
SENIOR REPUBLICANS MADE NO ATTEMPT TO DEFEND THE INDEFENSIBLE 
IT HURT US AND OUR STRUGGLE 
AND FOR WHAT OUR COMRADES HAD DIED FOR 
AND FOR WHAT WE HAD GONE TO JAIL AND SUFFERED FOR 
GERRY ADAMS PRESIDENT OF SINN FEIN MADE A STATEMENT SAYING HE COULD NOT 
JUSTIFY THE BOMBING AND OFFERED CONDOLENCES TO THE BEREAVED 
HE WENT ON TO WARN THE I. R. A. THAT SUCH DISASTERS MUST NEVER BE REPEATED 
THE I. R. A. HE SAID HAD TO BE CAREFUL AND CAREFUL AGAIN 
I UNDERSTAND THAT LATER ON THE DAY OF THE BOMB 
MARTIN MCGUINNESS WENT TO THE BORDER COUNTRY TO SPEAK TO I. R. A. UNITS 
HE WANTED TO FIND OUT WHY THE OPERATION HAD GONE SO BADLY WRONG 
DID IT FOCUS I. R. A. MINDS 
I THINK VERY MUCH SO 
I THINK WHAT HAPPENED THEN AT THE TIME WAS THAT THERE WAS A. 
DISCOURSE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS AS TO 
IF THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD WE'RE GOING TO MAKE NO PROGRESS 
I THINK IT DEEPLY AFFECTED THEIR STRATEGY 
ENNISKILLEN WAS AN UNPARALLELED CALAMITY FOR THE I. R. A. 
IT TRIGGERED FRESH THINKING 
PERHAPS ON REFLECTION ENNISKILLEN HAD A NUMBER OF EFFECTS 
CERTAINLY I WAS ON THE NATIONAL LEADERSHIP OF SINN FEIN AT THE TIME AND I REMEMBER GERRY ADAMS PROPOSING 
THAT WE MEET WITH OUR MAIN RIVALS WITHIN THE NATIONALIST COMMUNITY 
THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY THE S. D. L. P. AND WE'D A SERIES OF TALKS WITH THOSE 
THINGS STARTED TO MOVE 
GERRY ADAMS BEGAN TALKS WITH THE S. D. L. P. 
TALKS THAT SET THE ARCHITECTS OF THE LONG WAR ON THE LONG ROAD TO PEACE 
BUT IN THE AFTERMATH OF THESE TEN DAYS OF TERROR A CHILLING REALITY SEIZED BRITISH MINDS 
THE FOUR SHIPMENTS OF MODERN WEAPONS THAT ADRIAN HOPKINS HAD SUCCESSFULLY PILOTED FROM LIBYA 
REMAINED BURIED IN SECRET BUNKERS ACROSS IRELAND 
I THINK THERE WAS A FEELING OF ALARM 
THAT THESE MUNITIONS WOULD ENABLE THE LONG WAR IN A MILITARY SENSE 
TO GONE ON FOR A LONG TIME 
UNLESS WE COULD FIND SOME WAY OF ACHIEVING A POLITICAL SOLUTION 
I THINK IT REINFORCED THE VIEW THAT 
ALTHOUGH WE HAD TO GO ON FIGHTING THIS WAR IN A MILITARY SENSE 
CLEARLY WE WANTED TO BRING IT TO AN END 
SO IT MADE THE NEED TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION THE GREATER 
THE GREATER YES H. M. M. 
ADRIAN HOPKINS WAS TO SPEND FIVE YEARS IN JAIL 
FOR HIS PART IN SHIPPING LIBYAN ARMS TO THE I. R. A. 
AFTER ENNISKILLEN MANY OF THOSE ARMS WERE DEPLOYED WITH DEVASTATING EFFECT 
BUT THEY ALSO SERVED TO REMIND THE BRITISH THAT A WAY HAD TO BE FOUND 
OF BRINGING THE LONG WAR TO AN END 
MANY STREAMS WERE TO FLOW INTO THE LONG SLOW RIVER THAT WAS TO BECOME THE PEACE PROCESS 
STREAMS FROM IRELAND BRITAIN AND AMERICA 
BUT ATROCITIES LIKE THE ENNISKILLEN BOMB CAST A LONG SHADOW OVER THE JOURNEY 
MANY HAD TO ACCEPT REPUBLICAN LEADERS WITH AS THEY SAW IT 
BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS SHARING POWER IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT MARTIN MCGUINNESS BEING DEPUTY FIRST MINISTER 
IT'S HARD TO STOMACH 
BUT I THINK THAT WITH HAVING PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
IT'S THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED 
BUT I'D RATHER BE WHERE WE ARE NOW THAN BACK IN DURING THE TROUBLES 
I'M VERY PLEASED TO SEE DOCTOR PAISLEY 
SHARING WITH MARTIN MCGUINNESS 
HOW DO YOU REGARD MARTIN MCGUINNESS 
I REGARD HIM AS A GOOD POLITICIAN 
I'M SURE HE HAS TO LEARN A LOT 
WE ALL LEARN FROM EXPERIENCE 
BUT IT WAS A BIG STEP FOR HIM TOO 
AND I WISH HIM WELL 
AS FOR IAN PAISLEY I WANT TO WISH YOU ALL THE BEST AS WE STEP FORWARD 
TOWARDS THE GREATEST YET MOST EXCITING CHALLENGE OF OUR LIVES 
BUT PEACE WAS ONLY CEMENTED 
AFTER ONE FINAL OBSTACLE HAD BEEN OVERCOME 
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE I. R. A.'S ARSENAL MOST OF IT FROM GADDAFI 
BUT EVENTUALLY THE I. R. A.'S WEAPONS OF WAR WERE CONCRETED OVER 
AND THE LAST IMPEDIMENT TO PEACE WAS BURIED WITH THEM 
THIS CHAPTER IN THE AGE OF TERROR SHOWS THAT HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES 
PEACE CAN EMERGE FROM THE ASHES OF CONFLICT 
BUT IT REQUIRES DIALOGUE PATIENCE 
AND AN EXTRAORDINARY CAPACITY FOR FORGIVENESS 
THOSE TEN DAYS OF TERROR WERE A BEGINNING 
IN THE NEXT PROGRAMME A DRAMATIC NEW STAGE IN THE AGE OF TERROR 
THE EMERGENCE OF ISLAMIST TERROR 
AND A SPECTACULAR PLOT TO USE AN AIRCRAFT 
AS A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION 
SEVEN YEARS BEFORE NINE ELEVEN
