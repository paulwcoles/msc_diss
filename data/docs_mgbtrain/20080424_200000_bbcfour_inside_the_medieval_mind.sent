YOU ALONE ARE MY LOVE AND MY LONGING 
THE WORLD OF MEDIEVAL MEN AND WOMEN 
WAS SHAPED BY STRONG AND POWERFUL PASSIONS 
THE NAME OF WIFE MAY SEEM SACRED 
BUT SWEETER TO ME WILL ALWAYS BE THE WORD WHORE 
IN THE MEDIEVAL WORLD WOMEN ARE ADORED 
BUT ALSO PROMPT LOATHING AND DISGUST 
WOMAN IS BUT SATAN'S BAIT 
POISON FOR MEN'S SOULS 
IT'S A WORLD IN WHICH PRIESTS ACCUSE THEIR FLOCKS OF FORNICATION 
WHERE BISHOPS GROW RICH ON PROSTITUTION 
AND WHERE VIRGINS MARRY CHRIST 
AS I STOOD BY THE CROSS I WAS FILLED WITH SUCH FIRE 
I TOOK OFF MY CLOTHES AND OFFERED HIM ALL OF MYSELF 
IT'S A WORLD IN WHICH GOD THREATENS TO DESTROY MANKIND 
FOR THE SIN OF LUST 
SEXUAL INTERCOURSE BEGAN IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE 
OR SO AT LEAST 
WROTE THE POET PHILIP LARKIN 
BUT THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY TRUE 
SEXUAL ACTIVITY IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
WAS AS VIGOROUS AND AS VARIED AS IT IS TODAY 
JUST HOW VARIED IS MADE CLEAR FROM THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS 
THAT MEDIEVAL PRIESTS WERE INSTRUCTED 
TO ASK THEIR PARISHIONERS 
HAVE YOU COMMITTED FORNICATION WITH A NUN 
HAVE YOU COMMITTED FORNICATION WITH YOUR STEP MOTHER YOUR SISTER IN LAW 
YOUR SON'S FIANCEE YOUR MOTHER 
HAVE YOU MADE A TOOL OR DEVICE IN THE SHAPE OF A PENIS 
AND TIED IT TO YOUR PRIVATE PARTS AND FORNICATED WITH OTHER WOMEN 
PRIESTS MIGHT EVEN ASK FEMALE MEMBERS OF THEIR FLOCK 
HAVE YOU DONE WHAT SOME WOMEN DO WHEN THEY LIE BEFORE AN ANIMAL 
AND ENCOURAGE IT TO COPULATE BY WHATEVER MEANS THEY CAN 
AND THUS IT COPULATES WITH YOU 
SUCH QUESTIONS SUGGEST THAT SEXUAL ACTIVITY THEN WAS SHALL WE SAY 
AS DIVERSE AS IT IS TODAY 
BUT THE WORLD IN WHICH IT TOOK PLACE 
WAS A VERY VERY DIFFERENT WORLD 
THE MIDDLE AGES BETWEEN THE TENTH AND THE FIFTEENTH CENTURIES 
STAND ON THE FAR SIDE OF A GREAT DIVIDE IN HUMAN HISTORY 
THE EXPERIENCE OF BIRTH LIFE AND DEATH WAS DIFFERENT FROM NOW 
WHEREAS PEOPLE IN BRITAIN TODAY CAN EXPECT TO LIVE 
TO THEIR LATE SEVENTIES 
AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS THAN HALF THAT 
AND JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE EXPERIENCED DEATH AT FIRST HAND 
MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SEEN A BROTHER OR SISTER DIE 
MOST PARENTS WOULD HAVE LOST ONE OR MORE OF THEIR CHILDREN 
IN A MEDIEVAL VILLAGE OF ONE HUNDRED HOUSES 
A FUNERAL MIGHT TAKE PLACE EVERY EIGHT DAYS 
MALNUTRITION INFECTION DISEASE 
LIFE IN THE MIDDLE AGES WAS PRECARIOUS 
IT'S EASY TO IMAGINE MEDIEVAL LIFE AS JUST NASTY BRUTISH AND SHORT 
AS THE SAYING GOES 
A BASIC STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL LACKING IN PLEASURE PASSION OR FUN 
BUT IS THAT REALLY HOW IT WAS 
FAR FROM IT 
MEDIEVAL RECORDS SUGGEST A WORLD OF INTIMACY AND SENSUALITY 
WITH A KEEN INTEREST IN LOVE SEX AND REPRODUCTION 
AND SOME EXOTIC WAYS OF ENHANCING THEM 
THIS RECIPE FOR CONCEPTION 
COMES FROM A POPULAR THIRTEENTH CENTURY MEDICAL MANUAL 
THE SECRETS OF WOMEN 
IF SOMEONE SHOULD WISH TO HELP A WOMAN 
SO THAT SHE MIGHT BECOME PREGNANT 
LET HIM TAKE THE WOMB AND INTESTINES OF A HARE 
DRY THEM OUT AND PULVERIZE THEM 
AND LET THE WOMAN THEN DRINK THIS MIXED WITH WINE 
THEN LET HER PLACE A GOAT'S HAIR IN THE MILK OF A FEMALE DONKEY 
AND LET HER TIE THIS AROUND HER AT THE NAVEL 
WHILE SHE HAS SEX WITH HER HUSBAND 
AND SHE WILL CONCEIVE 
MEDIEVAL LOVERS WHO WANTED SEX BUT DIDN'T WANT THE CONSEQUENCES 
COULD TURN TO THE EXPERTS FOR CONTRACEPTIVE ADVICE 
A FRENCH PRIEST CALLED PIERRE CLERGUE SWORE BY A CERTAIN HERB 
HE WRAPPED IT IN LINEN AND TIED IT AROUND THE NECK OF HIS PARTNER 
SO THAT IT HUNG BETWEEN HER BREASTS AND THEN MADE LOVE TO HER 
THE EASIEST WAY TO AVOID CONCEPTION WAS TO DAMPEN SEXUAL DESIRE 
THE SECRETS OF WOMEN'S PROPOSAL FOR PUTTING OUT THE FLAMES OF PASSION 
WAS FOR A WOMAN TO DRINK A MAN'S URINE 
YOU'D THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE DONE IT 
AND IT HAS FURTHER COMMENTS ON CONTRACEPTIVE MEASURES 
IF A WOMAN EATS SAGE THAT HAS BEEN COOKED FOR THREE DAYS SHE WILL NOT CONCEIVE FOR A YEAR 
OR MORE DRASTICALLY 
IF A WOMAN SWALLOWS A BEE SHE WILL NEVER CONCEIVE 
WELL EVIDENTLY 
MEDIEVAL UNDERSTANDING OF SEX AND REPRODUCTION WAS PRETTY BASIC 
THE SCIENCE OF ANATOMY WAS NOT VERY ADVANCED 
AND DISSECTION WAS RARELY PRACTISED 
BUT THIS DIDN'T STOP SOME OF THE GREATEST MINDS OF THE AGE 
TRYING TO MAP THE MYSTERIES OF SEXUALITY 
IN SEATS OF LEARNING ALL OVER MEDIEVAL EUROPE 
SCHOLARS PONDERED THE PRESSING QUESTION 
JUST WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN 
THE CONSENSUS REACHED BY THESE MALE WRITERS MANY OF THEM CLERICS 
WAS THAT WOMEN WERE THE PROBLEM 
ACCORDING TO THE CLASSICAL THEORY OF THE FOUR HUMOURS 
MEN WERE THOUGHT TO BE HOT AND DRY WHICH WAS GOOD 
WOMEN WERE COLD AND MOIST WHICH WAS BAD 
THIS MADE THEM SEXUALLY VORACIOUS' 
WOMAN HAS A GREATER DESIRE FOR COITUS THAN A MAN 
FOR SOMETHING FOUL IS DRAWN TO SOMETHING GOOD 
THE REAL PUZZLE WAS JUST HOW THE FEMALE ANATOMY WORKED 
HERE AT MERTON COLLEGE IN OXFORD THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY DOCTOR JOHN OF GADDESDEN 
EXPRESSED THE STANDARD MEDIEVAL BELIEF THAT MENSTRUAL BLOOD 
WAS ACTUALLY FEMALE SEED 
EVIDENTLY WOMEN NEEDED TO PURGE THEMSELVES OF THIS SEED 
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED EVERY MONTH 
TOO GREAT A BUILD UP COULD LEAD TO SO CALLED SUFFOCATION OF THE UTERUS 
MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR HER TO BREATHE 
AND EXPOSING HER TO CONVULSIONS AND FAINTING FITS 
SHE MIGHT EVEN GO MAD 
NO WONDER WOMEN WERE PREDATORY 
THEY NEEDED SEX TO GET RID OF ALL THAT MENSTRUAL BLOOD 
WORSE THAT BLOOD WAS POSITIVELY DANGEROUS 
THIS BLOOD IS SO DETESTABLE THAT THROUGH CONTACT WITH IT 
FRUITS DO NOT PRODUCE WINE TURNS SOUR 
TREES LACK FRUIT THE AIR DARKENS 
AND DOGS GO WILD WITH MADNESS 
MEDIEVAL SCIENTIFIC THINKING TOOK IT EVEN FURTHER 
THE EYE IT ARGUED RECEIVES MENSTRUAL FLUID DURING A WOMAN'S PERIOD 
THE LOOK OF A MENSTRUATING WOMAN THEREFORE 
COULD IN ITSELF CAUSE DISEASE 
WOMAN IN SHORT WAS LITERALLY POISONOUS 
MEDIEVAL THINKING WAS JUST AS LOGICAL AS OURS 
BUT IT STARTED FROM DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS 
AND THOSE ASSUMPTIONS WERE OFTEN BASED ON RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE 
OR ANCIENT AUTHORITY 
AND THE GOVERNING IDEA BEHIND FEMALE SEXUALITY 
WAS THE BIBLICAL STORY OF THE GARDEN OF EDEN 
IN THE STORY OF ORIGINAL SIN 
THE DEVIL CHOOSES TO TRICK EVE RATHER THAN ADAM 
ATTACKING HUMAN NATURE IT WAS SAID WHERE IT SEEMED WEAKER 
EVE WAS SATAN'S BAIT POISON FOR MEN'S SOULS 
WROTE THE ELEVENTH CENTURY ITALIAN CARDINAL PETER DAMIAN 
IT WAS AN ACT OF BETRAYAL THAT FEW CHURCHMEN COULD FORGIVE 
THE WICKEDNESS OF WOMEN WROTE ONE THIRTEENTH CENTURY ABBOT 
IS GREATER THAN ALL THE OTHER WICKEDNESS OF THE WORLD 
ONE EARLY CHURCH FATHER REMINDED WOMEN 
DO YOU NOT REALISE THAT EVE IS YOU 
YOU DESECRATED THE FATEFUL TREE YOU DISOBEYED THE LAW OF GOD 
YOU PERSUADED THE MAN 
AGAINST WHOM THE DEVIL COULD NOT PREVAIL BY FORCE 
GOD'S SENTENCE PASSED UPON YOUR SEX WEIGHS STILL UPON THE WORLD 
YOU ARE GUILTY YOU MUST BEAR ITS HARDSHIPS 
YOU ARE THE DEVIL'S GATEWAY 
WITH WOMEN HELD IN SUCH LOW ESTEEM IT'S HARDLY SURPRISING 
THAT MEDIEVAL COURTSHIP COULD BE A RATHER UNROMANTIC AFFAIR 
MARRIAGE THEN WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM TODAY'S ROMANTIC IDEAL 
IT HAD VERY LITTLE IF ANYTHING TO DO WITH LOVE THAT MIGHT COME LATER 
IT WAS AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN FAMILIES 
AND AN AGREEMENT INVOLVING THE TRANSFER OF PROPERTY 
AND THE WIFE COULD BE SEEN AS PART OF THAT PROPERTY 
LIKE ANY PIECE OF PROPERTY SHE NEEDED CLOSE INSPECTION BEFORE A DEAL COULD BE DONE 
IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETEEN EDWARD THE SECOND SENT THE BISHOP OF EXETER TO INSPECT 
PHILIPPA OF HAINAULT AS PROSPECTIVE WIFE FOR HIS YOUNG SON 
THE BISHOP'S REPORT READS LIKE A PROPERTY SURVEY 
WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT IS 
THE LADY HAS NOT UNCOMELY HAIR BETWEEN BLUE BLACK AND BROWN 
HER EYES ARE BLACKISH BROWN AND DEEP 
HER NOSE IS FAIRLY SMOOTH AND EVEN 
YET IT IS NO SNUB NOSE HER MOUTH FAIRLY WIDE 
HER LIPS SOMEWHAT FULL AND ESPECIALLY THE LOWER LIP 
HER NECK SHOULDERS AND ALL HER BODY AND LOWER LIMBS 
ARE REASONABLY WELL SHAPEN 
ALL HER LIMBS ARE WELL SET AND UNMAIMED 
AND THE DAMSEL WILL BE ON SAINT JOHN'S DAY NEXT OF THE AGE OF NINE YEARS 
THE REPORT WENT DOWN WELL 
A DEAL WAS STRUCK 
NINE YEARS LATER PHILIPPA DULY MARRIED EDWARD'S SON EDWARD THE THIRD 
RICH BRIDES CAME WITH LAND ATTACHED 
SUBSTANTIAL PARTS OF EUROPE CHANGED HANDS WITH MARRIAGE CONTRACTS 
ORKNEY AND SHETLAND BECAME PART OF SCOTLAND 
WHEN A DANISH PRINCESS BROUGHT THEM AS HER DOWRY 
ON HER MARRIAGE TO THE KING OF SCOTLAND 
A PEASANT GIRL MIGHT BRING SOMETHING MORE MODEST AS HER DOWRY 
A COW OR SOME GEESE OR CHICKENS 
BUT IN ALL MARRIAGES THE WOMAN'S GOODS BECAME HER HUSBAND'S PROPERTY 
AS IN A SENSE DID THE WOMAN HERSELF 
THE LAW OFTEN PERMITTED HUSBANDS TO TREAT THEIR WIVES MUCH AS THEY WANTED 
IT IS LEGAL FOR A MAN TO BEAT HIS WIFE WHEN SHE WRONGS HIM 
PROVIDED HE NEITHER KILLS NOR MAIMS HER 
CONDEMNED AS THE CAUSE OF ORIGINAL SIN FEARED FOR HER SEXUALITY 
MARRIED IN EXCHANGE FOR PROPERTY OR GOODS 
SOMETIMES SUBJECT TO VIOLENCE 
A WOMAN'S LOT WAS NOT A HAPPY ONE 
AND THEN QUITE SUDDENLY INTO THIS SOCIETY THAT HELD WOMEN SO LOW 
CAME A REVOLUTION THAT SEEMED TO TURN ALL THIS INSIDE OUT 
IT BEGAN IN SOUTHERN FRANCE IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY 
TROUBADOURS WANDERING POETS AND MUSICIANS 
BECAME TO TALK OF WOMEN AND LOVE IN A WHOLLY NEW WAY 
THEY SANG OF AN INTENSE IDEALISED SEXUAL PASSION 
THEIR VERSES REACHED ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL WOMEN OF HER DAY 
THE DAUGHTER OF KING LOUIS THE SEVENTH OF FRANCE MARIE DE CHAMPAGNE 
MARIE'S COURT WAS HOME TO SINGERS WRITERS AND POETS 
SOON IT WAS ALIGHT WITH THE EXCITING IDEAS OF THE TROUBADOURS 
WHEN I LIE DOWN IN THE EVENING ALL NIGHT AND ALL DAY 
I CONSIDER HOW I MIGHT SERVE YOU TO YOUR PLEASURE 
MY BODY LEAPS AND BOUNDS FOR JOY 
SO MUCH IS MY HEART SET ON YOU 
THE POETS PUT WOMEN ON A PEDESTAL 
SHE WAS WORSHIPPED AS DISTANT AND HARD TO ATTAIN 
HE WAS HER TORMENTED LOVER 
I HAVE NEVER HAD POWER OVER MYSELF NOR WAS I MINE 
FROM THAT MOMENT WHEN SHE LET ME LOOK INTO HER EYES 
THE IDEA OF FALLING IN LOVE WAS BORN 
OF COURSE PEOPLE SPOKE ABOUT LOVE BEFORE ELEVEN HUNDRED 
BUT THIS WAS CARITAS A SPIRITUAL LOVE 
THE POETRY THAT CAPTURED THE IMAGINATION OF NOBLEWOMEN 
LIKE MARIE DE CHAMPAGNE WAS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT 
AN IDEALISED KIND OF SEXUAL PASSION 
IT'S SOMETIMES KNOWN AS COURTLY LOVE 
AND ITS HEADY IDEALS SPREAD FROM COURT TO COURT 
ACROSS THE BREADTH OF EUROPE 
A NEW GENERATION OF WRITERS AND POETS BEGAN TO EXPLORE 
THIS NEW WAY OF LOOKING AT LOVE 
ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS IS CHRETIEN DE TROYES 
AUTHOR OF A REVOLUTIONARY TALE OF ADULTEROUS PASSION 
HIS CELEBRATED LOVE STORY OF LANCELOT AND GUINEVERE 
ARTHUR'S GREATEST KNIGHT AND ARTHUR'S QUEEN 
FOLLOWS THE EXCITING PATH OF TRUE LOVE 
FOR HIS RICH PATRON AND THE LADIES OF COURT 
IT PROVIDED A WHOLE NEW STANDARD 
BY WHICH TO MEASURE THE BEHAVIOUR OF MEN 
AND LEARN ABOUT THEIR OWN SEXUAL IDENTITY 
THE STORY BEGINS WHEN LANCELOT FALLS IN LOVE 
AND IS ALMOST INCAPACITATED BY HIS OBSESSION 
AS LONG AS SHE REMAINED IN HIS SIGHT 
HE CONTINUED TO GAZE AT HER MOST ATTENTIVELY AND WITH DELIGHT 
BUT WHEN HE COULD SEE HER NO LONGER 
HE WANTED TO FLING HIMSELF OUT OF THE WINDOW 
AND SHATTER HIS BODY ON THE GROUND BELOW 
FOR THE COURTLY LOVER LOVE IS AN EXQUISITE PAIN 
IF SHE DOES NOT HEAL MY SUFFERING WITH A KISS 
SHE WILL MURDER ME AND DAMN HERSELF 
YET FOR ALL THE SUFFERING I ENDURE I DO NOT RENOUNCE SWEET LOVE 
LANCELOT TRIES TO WIN THE QUEEN'S LOVE 
HE SUBJECTS HIMSELF TO UNTOLD DANGERS 
INCLUDING CRAWLING OVER A BRIDGE MADE FROM THE BLADE OF A SWORD 
GUINEVERE IS EVENTUALLY WON OVER AND ARRANGES A MIDNIGHT RENDEZVOUS 
TONIGHT WHEN EVERYONE IS ASLEEP YOU CAN COME SPEAK WITH ME 
AT THAT WINDOW 
FOR LANCELOT THE DAY SEEMS TO LAST A HUNDRED YEARS 
AS NIGHT FALLS THE QUEEN APPEARS IN A CLOAK OF SCARLET AND FUR 
BUT THE IRON BARS ACROSS THE WINDOW KEEP THEM APART 
LANCELOT GRASPED THE BARS AND STRAINED AND PULLED 
UNTIL HE HAD FREED THEM FROM THEIR FITTINGS 
AT LAST THE ADULTEROUS LOVE AFFAIR CAN BE CONSUMMATED 
NOW LANCELOT HAD EVERYTHING HE DESIRED HE HELD HER IN HIS ARMS 
THEIR BLOWS WERE SO GENTLE SO SWEET 
THAT THROUGH THEIR KISSES AND CARESSES 
THEY EXPERIENCED A JOY AND WONDER THE EQUAL OF WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN KNOWN 
THE IMPACT OF THIS DARING NEW LITERATURE WAS DRAMATIC 
COURTLY LOVE UNREQUITED LOVE ADULTEROUS LOVE 
FOR THE FIRST TIME NOBLE WOMEN WERE EXPOSED TO PASSIONATE LOVE LITERATURE 
WITH ITS FANTASY OF THE DEVOTED KNIGHTLY LOVER 
FOR A CERTAIN CLASS OF MEDIEVAL SOCIETY AT LEAST 
THE MAP OF THE HEART WAS BEING REDRAWN 
THE NEW POETS QUESTIONED THE OLD CERTAINTIES 
COULD REAL LOVE EXIST AT ALL WITHIN MARRIAGE 
OR DID LOVE HAVE TO BE FREELY GIVEN 
WHEN MADE PUBLIC LOVE RARELY ENDURES 
A NEW LOVE PUTS AN OLD ONE TO FLIGHT 
HE WHO IS VEXED BY THE THOUGHTS OF LOVE SLEEPS AND EATS LITTLE 
THESE RULES WERE WRITTEN BY A MAN CALLED ANDREW THE CHAPLAIN 
WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT HIM EXCEPT THAT LIKE CHRETIEN DE TROYES 
HE FREQUENTED THE COURT OF MARIE DE CHAMPAGNE 
HIS THREE PART TREATISE DE AMORE ON LOVE 
IS THE MEDIEVAL EQUIVALENT OF A MODERN DAY SELF HELP GUIDE 
WRITERS SUCH AS ANDREW THE CHAPLAIN CAST THEMSELVES AS LOVE'S EXPLORERS 
POINTING THE WAY THROUGH THIS BRAVE NEW EMOTIONAL WORLD 
WHAT'S EXTRAORDINARY IS HOW FAR THEY VENTURED 
FROM THE DECIDEDLY UNROMANTIC ARRANGEMENTS USUALLY MADE 
BY MEDIEVAL MEN AND WOMEN 
WHY DID THE CULT OF COURTLY LOVE INSPIRE SUCH DEVOTION 
WAS IT AN EMOTIONAL PRESSURE VALVE 
RELEASING SOME OF THE REPRESSED SEXUAL ENERGY OF THE AGE 
WAS IT A NATURAL DEVELOPMENT FROM RELIGIOUS LOVE 
AS THE ARISTOCRACY REFINED THEIR EMOTIONAL MANNERS 
NOBODY KNOWS FOR SURE 
BUT THE CORE IDEAS OF COURTLY LOVE INFILTRATED THE WIDER MEDIEVAL CULTURE 
AND AS THEY DID THEY CAUSED SCANDAL EVEN VIOLENCE 
IT WAS ONE THING TO DEBATE THE NEW CODES OF LOVE 
IN ARISTOCRATIC COURTS 
IT WAS QUITE ANOTHER TO LIVE BY THEM 
ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE TALES OF THE MIDDLE AGES 
A TALE THAT IS PASSIONATE DRAMATIC TRAGIC AND TRUE 
IS THE LOVE STORY OF ABELARD AND HELOISE 
PETER ABELARD WAS A SCHOLAR WHO CAME TO PARIS IN ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED 
AT THE SAME TIME THAT COURTLY LOVE WAS SWEEPING EUROPE 
IN PARIS HE MET THE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL HELOISE 
SHE LIVED WITH HER UNCLE A CANON AT THE CATHEDRAL OF NOTRE DAME 
I BECAME ON FIRE WITH DESIRE FOR THIS GIRL 
AND DECIDED SHE WAS THE ONE TO BRING TO MY BED 
HELOISE'S UNCLE EMPLOYED THE DASHING ABELARD AS TUTOR TO HIS NIECE 
IF HE HAD ENTRUSTED A TENDER LAMB TO A RAVENING WOLF 
IT WOULD NOT HAVE SURPRISED ME MORE 
WITH OUR BOOKS BEFORE US 
MORE WORDS OF LOVE THAN OF OUR READING PASSED BETWEEN US 
AND MORE KISSING THAN TEACHING 
MY HANDS OFTENER STRAYED TO HER BOSOM THAN TO THE PAGES 
OUR DESIRES LEFT NO STAGE OF LOVEMAKING UNTRIED 
HELOISE BECAME PREGNANT AND GAVE BIRTH TO A BABY BOY 
HER UNCLE WAS FURIOUS 
BUT WHEN ABELARD OFFERED TO MARRY HER AND PLACATE THE FAMILY 
HE ENCOUNTERED AN UNEXPECTED OBSTACLE 
HELOISE HAD HER OWN RATHER UNCONVENTIONAL VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT 
IN HER WORDS ONLY LOVE FREELY GIVEN 
MATTERED TO HER NOT WHAT SHE CALLED THE CHAINS OF WEDLOCK 
THE NAME OF WIFE MAY SEEM MORE SACRED OR MORE WORTHY 
BUT SWEETER TO ME WILL ALWAYS BE THE WORD LOVER 
OR THAT OF CONCUBINE OR WHORE 
HELOISE WAS USING THE ARGUMENTS OF THE TROUBADOURS 
AND WRITERS OF THE COURTLY LOVE TRADITION 
THAT TRUE LOVE COULD ONLY EXIST OUTSIDE OF MARRIAGE 
SUCH NOTIONS STRAINED AT THE CONVENTIONS 
THAT BOUND MEDIEVAL SOCIETY TOGETHER 
EVENTUALLY HELOISE AGREED TO A SECRET MARRIAGE 
SOON AFTER SHE TOOK REFUGE IN A NUNNERY 
HER UNCLE AND HIS RELATIVES PRESUMED THAT THEY'D BEEN TRICKED 
AND THAT ABELARD HAD BACKED OUT OF HIS MARRIAGE TO HELOISE 
BY MAKING HER A NUN 
THEIR REVENGE WAS SWIFT AND VIOLENT 
ONE NIGHT AS I SLEPT PEACEFULLY IN AN INNER ROOM IN MY LODGINGS 
THEY BRIBED ONE OF MY SERVANTS TO ADMIT THEM 
AND THERE TOOK CRUEL VENGEANCE ON ME 
OF SUCH APPALLING BARBARITY AS TO SHOCK THE WHOLE WORLD 
THEY CUT OFF THE PART OF MY BODY WHEREBY I HAD COMMITTED THE WRONG OF WHICH THEY COMPLAINED 
ABELARD JOINED A MONASTERY 
AND HELOISE THIS TIME TRULY BECAME A NUN 
THE LETTERS OF THE TWO LOVERS GIVE US AN AMAZING INSIGHT 
INTO THE WORKINGS OF THE MEDIEVAL HEART 
YEARS LATER HELOISE RECOUNTS HOW THOUGH NOW AN ABBESS 
SHE IS STILL MOVED BY STRONG EROTIC DESIRE FOR ABELARD 
THE PLEASURES WE SHARED HAVE BEEN TOO SWEET 
AND CAN SCARCELY BE BANISHED FROM MY THOUGHTS 
BRINGING WITH THEM AWAKENED LONGINGS AND FANTASIES 
EVEN DURING THE CELEBRATION OF THE MASS 
LEWD VISIONS OF THOSE PLEASURES 
TAKE SUCH A HOLD UPON MY UNHAPPY SOUL 
THAT MY THOUGHTS ARE ON THEIR WANTONNESS INSTEAD OF ON PRAYERS 
THE IDEAS THAT STARTED WITH THE TROUBADOURS TRANSFORMED OUR CULTURE 
THE LANGUAGE OF ROMANCE OF SEXUAL LONGING 
UNREQUITED LOVE AND DESIRE WAS BORN 
AND THE CODES CREATED IN THE MIDDLE AGES LAST TO THIS DAY 
BUT WHILE THE IDEAS OF COURTLY LOVE SEDUCED ARISTOCRATS AND INTELLECTUALS 
THE LIVES OF MOST MEDIEVAL PEOPLE WERE GUIDED BY A MORE AUSTERE CREED 
FOR THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH 
NOTHING COULD BE MORE OFFENSIVE THAN THE IDEA OF SEXUAL PLEASURE 
IN THIRTEENTH CENTURY ENGLAND THERE WERE FORTY THOUSAND CLERGY 
SEVENTEEN THOUSAND MONKS AND FRIARS TEN THOUSAND PARISH PRIESTS 
AND THEY WERE TO BECOME INCREASINGLY INTRUSIVE 
IN THE SEX LIVES OF THE FAITHFUL 
THE CHURCH'S VIEWS ON THE PLEASURES OF THE FLESH 
WERE RATHER DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE TROUBADOURS 
THE FOUL EMBRACE OF THE FLESH EXHALES FUMES 
AND CONTAMINATES ANYONE WHO CLEAVES TO IT 
NOR DOES ANYONE ESCAPE UNHARMED FROM THE BITE OF PLEASURE 
CELIBATE PRIESTS WORKED TIRELESSLY TO WARN THEIR FLOCKS 
AGAINST THE DANGERS OF CARNAL PLEASURES DENIED TO THEM 
THAT SINFUL ACT THAT DISGUSTING ACT 
THAT BESTIAL COUPLING THAT SHAMELESS UNION 
THAT FOUL STINKING WAYWARD DEED 
ONE TWELFTH CENTURY RELIGIOUS WRITER HAD A USEFUL TIP 
FOR CONTROLLING LUSTFUL DESIRES FOR A WOMAN 
TRY IMAGINING WHAT THE INSIDE OF HER BODY WOULD LOOK LIKE 
IF YOU CONSIDER WHAT IS WITHIN THE SKIN AND INSIDE THE BODY 
WHAT IS MORE HIDEOUS TO SEE MORE DISGUSTING TO TOUCH 
MORE FOUL TO SMELL 
AND IF THIS WASN'T ENOUGH TRY THINKING OF HER DEAD BODY 
WHAT IS MORE HORRIBLE THAN A CORPSE 
AND WHAT IN THE WORLD WOULD BE MORE ABHORRENT TO HER LOVER 
JUST RECENTLY SO FULL OF WILD DESIRE FOR THAT STINKING FLESH 
IN MEDIEVAL THINKING HUMAN BEINGS OCCUPIED A POSITION 
HALFWAY BETWEEN THE ANIMALS AND THE ANGELS 
IN SEX IT SAW THE ANIMAL TRIUMPHANT 
AGAINST THE FILTH OF SEX THE CHURCH PROMOTED ITS ALTERNATIVE 
VIRGINITY IS THE HIGHEST VIRTUE A GLORIOUS BEAUTY 
THE SOURCE OF LIFE A MATCHLESS SONG 
THE CROWN OF FAITH THE PROP OF HOPE 
THE MIRROR OF PURITY KINDRED OF THE ANGELS 
THE NOURISHMENT AND SUPPORT OF MOST ENDURING LOVE 
THIS IS LACOCK ABBEY IN WILTSHIRE FOUNDED IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TWO 
IT WAS ONE OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY NUNNERIES IN MEDIEVAL ENGLAND 
UNTIL THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY NUNS 
MOSTLY LADIES OF GOOD FAMILY LIVED AND WORSHIPPED HERE 
UNDERTAKING A LIFE OF REFLECTION AND CELIBACY 
HERE A YOUNG WOMAN BECAME A BRIDE OF CHRIST 
VIRGINITY WAS A TREASURE TO BE DEDICATED TO CHRIST 
THE DIVINE BRIDEGROOM 
THERE IS SOMETHING UNDENIABLY SENSUAL 
IN THE WAY A WOMAN'S PASSIONATE DEVOTION TO CHRIST 
IS OFTEN DESCRIBED IN MEDIEVAL TEXTS 
JACQUES DE VITRY IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY 
DESCRIBES SOME NUNS SO WEAKENED BY ECSTASY OF LOVE FOR CHRIST 
THAT THEY WERE CONFINED TO REST 
THEY MELTED ALTOGETHER IN WONDROUS LOVE FOR GOD 
UNTIL THEY BOWED UNDER THE BURDEN OF DESIRE 
AND FOR MANY YEARS THEY DID NOT LEAVE THEIR BEDS 
AT TIMES THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SENSUAL AND SPIRITUAL LOVE 
DISSOLVES COMPLETELY 
OH NOBLE EAGLE 
OH TENDER LAMB OH BURNING FLAME EMBRACE ME 
HOW LONG SHALL I REMAIN ARID 
AN HOUR IS TOO HEAVY FOR ME AND A DAY IS AS A THOUSAND YEARS 
THE MYSTIC ANGELA OF FOLIGNO TOOK THE IDEA OF BEING A BRIDE OF CHRIST QUITE LITERALLY 
AS I STOOD BY THE CROSS I WAS FILLED WITH SUCH FIRE 
THAT I REMOVED ALL MY CLOTHES AND OFFERED HIM ALL OF MYSELF 
I PROMISED HIM THOUGH AFEARED TO MAINTAIN MY CHASTITY ALWAYS 
AND NOT TO OFFEND HIM BY ONE OF MY LIMBS 
PURER THAN GLASS WHITER THAN SNOW MORE BRILLIANT THAN THE SUN 
THE CULT OF VIRGINITY EXERTED A POWERFUL GRIP 
ON THE MINDS OF MANY MEDIEVAL WOMEN 
SOMETIMES THREATENING TO TEAR FAMILIES APART 
TAKE OF THE STORY OF CHRISTINA OF MARKYATE 
CHRISTINA WAS FROM A PROSPEROUS ENGLISH FAMILY IN HUNTINGDON 
A YOUNG MAN OF HER OWN CLASS BURTHRED SOUGHT HER IN MARRIAGE 
AND GAINED HER PARENTS' CONSENT 
CHRISTINA AGREED ON ONE CONDITION 
THAT SHE REMAIN A VIRGIN ALL HER LIFE 
FOR THIS IS WHAT SHE HAD ALREADY VOWED TO DO 
HER FAMILY WERE APPALLED 
THEY RIDICULED HER AND TRIED TO BREAK HER RESOLVE 
BY STOPPING HER GOING TO CHURCH 
TAKING HER OUT TO PARTIES GIVING HER LOVE POTIONS 
FINALLY THEY DID A DEAL WITH BURTHRED 
THEY AGREED TO LET HIM IN AT NIGHT 
BUT CHRISTINA STAYED UP 
TELLING HIM EXEMPLARY STORIES OF CHASTE MARRIAGES 
SHE PROMISED TO LIVE WITH HIM AS SHE PUT IT 
SO THAT OTHER TOWNSMEN WILL NOT TAUNT YOU FOR HAVING BEEN REJECTED BY ME 
BUT STILL IT WOULD HAVE TO BE AS A VIRGIN 
BURTHRED LEFT WITHOUT HAVING HAD SEX 
HIS FRIENDS TEASED HIM SO HE TRIED AGAIN 
HE BURST INTO HER BEDROOM DETERMINED TO HAVE HER 
BUT SHE HID FROM HIM 
AND MIRACULOUSLY SHE MANAGED TO AVOID DETECTION 
CHRISTINA'S STUBBORNNESS INFURIATED HER PARENTS 
HER FATHER THREATENED TO THROW HER OUT OF THE HOUSE 
WHILE HER MOTHER GRABBED HER BY THE HAIR AND BEAT HER 
ONLY VISIONS OF THE VIRGIN MARY 
SUSTAINED CHRISTINA THROUGH HER ORDEAL 
TO AVOID THE FURY OF HER FAMILY 
AND SEX WITH HER HUSBAND CHRISTINA FLED TO LIVE THE LIFE OF A HERMIT 
AFTER TWO YEARS BURTHRED GAVE UP 
AND RELEASED HER FROM HER MARITAL OBLIGATIONS 
CHRISTINA AND THE CULT OF VIRGINITY 
EMERGED THE VICTOR FROM THIS BITTER FAMILY CONFLICT 
SHE FOUNDED A CONVENT OF NUNS AND DIED A VIRGIN 
FAITHFUL IN HER MARRIAGE TO CHRIST 
MOST PEOPLE OF COURSE PREFERRED A WEDDING TO A FLESH AND BLOOD MAN OR WOMAN THAN TO CHRIST 
THEY WANTED MARRIAGE SEX AND CHILDREN 
IT WAS AN AREA THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH WAS KEEN TO COLONISE 
RIGHT INTO THE BEDROOM 
EARLY MEDIEVAL MARRIAGE HAD LITTLE TO DO WITH THE CHURCH 
AND COULD BE ENTERED INTO QUITE CASUALLY 
THIS DESCRIPTION OF A PEASANT MARRIAGE 
WAS GIVEN BY A WITNESS IN A COURT CASE HELD IN YORK 
ABOUT THE THIRD HOUR PAST THE NINTH JOHN BEKE SADDLER 
SITTING DOWN ON A BENCH CALLED MARJORY TO HIM AND SAID TO HER 
MARJORY DO YOU WISH TO BE MY WIFE 
AND SHE REPLIED I WILL IF YOU WISH 
AND TAKING AT ONCE THE SAID MARJORY'S RIGHT HAND JOHN SAID 
MARJORY HERE I TAKE YOU AS MY WIFE 
FOR BETTER OR WORSE TO HAVE AND TO HOLD UNTIL THE END OF MY LIFE 
THIS CASUAL APPROACH HORRIFIED THE CHURCH AUTHORITIES 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THE STATUTES OF THE DIOCESE OF SALISBURY MAKE THIS CLEAR 
THEY RULED THAT MARRIAGES SHOULD BE CELEBRATED 
WITH REVERENCE AND WITH HONOUR AND NOT WITH LAUGHING AND JOKING 
IN TAVERNS OR AT PUBLIC FEASTS OR DRINKING PARTIES 
NOR SHOULD ANYONE PUT A RING MADE OF RUSHES OR SOME OTHER MATERIAL 
CHEAP OR PRECIOUS ON SOME GIRL'S HAND FOR FUN 
TO BE ABLE TO FORNICATE WITH HER MORE FREELY 
FOR HE MAY FIND THAT 
ALTHOUGH HE THINKS HE IS JOKING 
HE HAS IN FACT BOUND HIMSELF TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF MATRIMONY 
MARRIAGE THE CHURCH ARGUED WAS NOT A MERE CONTRACT 
IT WAS A RELIGIOUS EVENT 
IN TIME IT WAS PRONOUNCED A SACRAMENT 
LIKE BAPTISM OR CONFESSION 
AS FOR SEX THE ACT OF MARRIAGE DID NOT EXCUSE UNRESTRICTED LOVEMAKING 
A SAYING OF THE GREAT SAINT AUGUSTINE BECAME PROVERBIAL 
PASSIONATE LOVE OF ONE'S OWN WIFE IS ADULTERY 
THE ONLY LEGITIMATE CAUSE FOR SEX WITHIN MARRIAGE WAS REPRODUCTION 
AND THAT WAS A SERIOUS DUTY 
FAILURE TO CONSUMMATE A MARRIAGE WAS GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT 
SOMETHING ONLY THE CHURCH HAD AUTHORITY TO DO 
IN RELIGIOUS COURTS 
THE CHURCH PROBED JUST WHAT HAD OR HAD NOT HAPPENED IN THE MARITAL BED 
JOHN A MAN FROM YORK WAS ACCUSED BY HIS WIFE OF IMPOTENCE 
EVERY EFFORT WAS MADE TO AROUSE HIM 
AND THE PROCEDURE WAS DOCUMENTED IN COURT RECORDS 
THE WITNESS EXPOSED HER BARE BREASTS 
AND WITH HER HANDS WARMED AT THE FIRE 
SHE HELD AND RUBBED JOHN'S PENIS AND HIS TESTICLES 
EMBRACING AND FREQUENTLY KISSING HIM 
AND SHE STIRRED HIM UP TO DEMONSTRATE HIS VIRILITY AND POTENCY 
ADMONISHING HIM TO PROVE AND RENDER HIMSELF A MAN THEN AND THERE 
SHE SAYS THAT THE WHOLE TIME 
THE SAID PENIS WAS SCARCELY THREE INCHES LONG 
REMAINING WITHOUT ANY INCREASE 
THE CHURCH ALSO SET ABOUT REGULATING WHEN WHERE 
AND WITH WHOM SEX COULD TAKE PLACE 
THOSE WHO BROKE THE RULES 
EVEN IN THOUGHT WERE TO BE PUNISHED 
IN ROME IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN POPE INNOCENT THE THIRD MADE A DRAMATIC INTERVENTION 
IN SEXUAL AFFAIRS 
ALL CHRISTIANS WERE TO CONFESS THEIR SINS TO A PRIEST 
AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR 
IT WAS A MOVE DESIGNED TO HELP THE CLERGY TO ROOT OUT DEPRAVITY 
TO HELP PRIESTS HEARING CONFESSIONS TO DECIDE WHAT QUESTIONS TO ASK 
THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SINS THEY HEARD AND HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM 
ENCYCLOPAEDIC GUIDEBOOKS KNOWN AS CONFESSORS' MANUALS 
WERE WIDELY CIRCULATED 
THE BIGGEST SINGLE CATEGORY IN THESE COMPENDIA OF SIN WAS SEX 
THE MESSAGE OF THE CONFESSORS' MANUALS 
SEX SHOULD ONLY TAKE PLACE WITHIN MARRIAGE 
ANY OTHER FORM OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY WAS CONSIDERED A SIN 
BUT EVEN WITHIN MARRIAGE SEX WAS NO EASY MATTER 
TO AVOID SINNING THE CHURCH HAD A CHECKLIST 
THAT A HUSBAND SHOULD RUN THROUGH FIRST 
IS YOUR WIFE MENSTRUATING IS YOUR WIFE PREGNANT 
IS YOUR WIFE NURSING A CHILD 
IS IT LENT 
IS IT ADVENT 
IS IT SUNDAY 
IS IT WHITSUN WEEK 
IS IT EASTER WEEK 
IS IT WEDNESDAY 
IS IT FRIDAY 
IS IT A FAST DAY 
IS IT SATURDAY 
IS IT A FEAST DAY 
IS IT DAYLIGHT 
ARE YOU NAKED 
ARE YOU IN CHURCH 
IF YOU ANSWERED NO TO ALL THESE QUESTIONS THEN SEX WAS PERMISSIBLE 
BUT ONLY ONCE AND ONLY IN WHAT IS NOW CALLED THE MISSIONARY POSITION 
TAKING EVERYTHING INTO ACCOUNT THE CHURCH'S SEXUAL POLICING 
PERMITTED MARRIED COUPLES TO HAVE SEX ON AVERAGE JUST ONCE A WEEK 
PUNISHMENTS OR PENANCES 
INVOLVED A COMPLEX SYSTEM OF FASTING AND ABSTINENCE 
THE MANUALS CALIBRATED PENANCE TO FIT EACH SIN 
FOR ADULTERY ONCE TWO YEARS' PENANCE 
FOR ADULTERY TWICE FIVE YEARS 
FOR SEX WITH AN ANIMAL SEVEN YEARS 
THERE WERE SPECIAL QUESTIONS FOR WOMEN 
HAD THEY CONSUMED THEIR HUSBAND'S SEMEN 
IN ORDER TO INFLAME THEIR LUST SEVEN YEARS 
OR PUT THEIR MENSTRUAL BLOOD IN THEIR HUSBAND'S FOOD 
IN ORDER TO EXCITE HIM FIVE YEARS 
THIS PROCESS OF CONFESSION AND PENANCE 
MAPPED OUT EVERY ASPECT OF HUMAN SEXUALITY 
AND CODIFIED A SLIDING SCALE OF PUNISHMENTS 
AND FOR THOSE WHO CHOSE TO FLOUT THE RULES 
THE CHURCH HAD A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL OF INVESTIGATION AND RETRIBUTION 
AWAY FROM THE PRIVACY OF THE CONFESSIONAL 
WAS A MORE PUBLIC COURT 
ONE WHERE THE SINS OF THE FAITHFUL COULD BE HELD UP 
AND PUBLICLY CONDEMNED 
IN THE DIOCESE OF LINCOLN SUSPECTS WERE BROUGHT HERE 
TO THE GREAT CATHEDRAL 
INSIDE CLERICS SAT IN JUDGEMENT OVER THE ACCUSED 
HERE IN THE CHAPTER HOUSE 
THE CREATION OF CHURCH COURTS WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY EXTENSION 
OF THE CHURCH'S CONTROL OVER PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOUR 
CONFESSION WAS A PRIVATE MATTER 
THIS WAS SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
YOU COULD BE SUMMONED BEFORE THE COURT 
ON SUSPICION OF YOUR BEHAVIOUR 
AND AGAIN IT WAS SEX 
THAT PREOCCUPIED THE MINDS OF THE AUTHORITIES 
THE JUDGES WHO SAT HERE COULD IMPOSE STERN PENALTIES 
EXCOMMUNICATION FINES AND VERY PUBLIC PENANCE 
THIS BOOK CONTAINS THE RECORDS OF THE COURT CASES 
HEARD IN THIS CHAPTER HOUSE 
AND IN THE PARISH CHURCHES OF THE DIOCESE OF LINCOLN 
ON MONDAY THE SIXTEENTH OF NOVEMBER ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT 
THE COURT MET AND HEARD CERTAIN CASES 
JOHN WARREN ACCUSED OF FORNICATION WITH ELLEN LANSER 
BOTH APPEAR AND CONFESS THE SIN AND SWEAR NOT TO SIN AGAIN 
UNDER PENALTY OF FORTY PENCE 
ORDERED TO BE BEATEN THREE TIMES AROUND THE CHURCH 
THOMAS OF THORNTON PRIEST 
REPUTED TO HAVE COMMITTED FORNICATION WITH ALICE DAUGHTER OF ROBERT MASTER 
SHE IS ORDERED AS A PENANCE 
TO BE BEATEN TWELVE TIMES AROUND THE MARKET SQUARE 
AND TWELVE TIMES AROUND THE CHURCH NAKED EXCEPT FOR HER CHEMISE 
BEATRICE DAUGHTER OF WILLIAM DUTY PREGNANT IT IS NOT KNOWN BY WHOM 
APPEARED IN THE CHAPTER HOUSE AT LINCOLN AND CONFESSED THE SIN 
AND WAS ABSOLVED SWORE NOT TO SIN AGAIN 
ORDERED TO BE BEATEN SIX TIMES AROUND THE CHURCH 
ON SUNDAYS AND FEAST DAYS IN FRONT OF ALL THE PROCESSION 
RELIGIOUS AUTHORITIES RELIED HEAVILY ON FEAR AND SHAME 
TO POLICE THEIR FLOCK 
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
THE FULL MACHINERY OF THE CHURCH WAS BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON THE SEXUAL ACTIVITIES OF THE FAITHFUL 
FOR THE CHURCH SEXUAL PURITY WAS AN IDEAL 
BUT IT WAS AN IDEAL THAT WAS DIFFICULT TO LIVE UP TO 
EVEN FOR MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH 
TAKE THIS BOOK FOR EXAMPLE 
COPIED OUT BY THE MONKS OF SAINT AUGUSTINE'S ABBEY CANTERBURY 
AROUND THE YEAR TWELVE HUNDRED 
THE FIRST HALF IS FAIRLY INNOCUOUS A HISTORY OF ENGLISH BISHOPS 
BUT AT THE END IS A SERIES OF PORNOGRAPHIC STORIES 
COPIED OUT AND PRESUMABLY ENJOYED BY THE MONKS 
ONE OF THEM CONCERNS A MAN AND WIFE 
WHO WENT ON PILGRIMAGE TO THE HOLY LAND 
ONE EVENING THEY TOOK REFUGE IN THE BACK OF A CAVE 
NINE SARACENS COME IN LIGHT A FIRE AND STRIP OFF 
THE WOMAN SEES THEIR VIRILIA THEIR VIRILE MEMBERS 
AND BECOMES SO EXCITED 
THAT SHE INSISTS HER HUSBAND MAKE LOVE TO HER 
AFTER HE'S DONE SO THREE TIMES 
HE CAN'T MANAGE A FOURTH AND FALLS ASLEEP 
AND THE WOMAN THEN OFFERS HERSELF TO THE SARACENS 
ALL NINE OF THEM 
PRIESTS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE CELIBATE 
AT LEAST IN THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 
WHEN THE CHURCH DECIDED THEY COULD NO LONGER MARRY 
BUT SOME LIVED WITH MISTRESSES OR HAD AFFAIRS WITH OTHER MEN'S WIVES' 
THEY WERE THE TARGET OF THE OCCASIONAL SATIRICAL POEM 
WHAT DO PRIESTS DO WITH NO WOMAN OF THEIR OWN 
THEY FORCE THEMSELVES ON OTHERS 
THEY HAVE NO FEAR THEY FEEL NO SHAME 
TAKE MARRIED WOMEN AS THEIR LOVERS 
MEDIEVAL CLERGY HAD OTHER WAYS TO SATISFY THEIR SEXUAL DESIRES 
BY MAKING USE OF AN INSTITUTION EVEN OLDER THAN THEIR OWN 
THE RECORDS OF THE BROTHELS OF DIJON IN FRANCE 
REVEAL THAT AT LEAST TWENTY PER CENT OF THE CLIENTELE WERE CHURCHMEN 
AGED MONKS MENDICANT FRIARS CANONS PRIESTS 
ALL OF THEM VISITING PROSTITUTES IN THE CITY'S BATHHOUSES' 
A MEDIEVAL BROTHEL COULD PROVIDE A HEALTHY INCOME 
AS WELL AS A SEXUAL OUTLET FOR CHURCH DIGNITARIES 
THE BISHOP OF WINCHESTER RECEIVED A REGULAR RENT FROM THE BROTHELS 
IN THE RED LIGHT DISTRICT OF SOUTHWARK 
WHICH IS WHY THE PROSTITUTES FROM THE AREA 
WERE REFERRED TO AS WINCHESTER GEESE 
REGARDLESS OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF ITS OWN CLERGY 
THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH VIGOROUSLY CONDEMNED AND PUNISHED 
MOST KINDS OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY 
BUT THERE WAS ONE SEXUAL PRACTICE FOR WHICH MEDIEVAL SOCIETY RESERVED 
ITS MOST SAVAGE CONDEMNATION 
THE SIN OF SODOMY 
MALE HOMOSEXUALITY WAS SOMETHING MEDIEVAL CLERICS KNEW ABOUT 
THIS WAS A TIME WHEN THOUSANDS OF MEN LIVED TOGETHER 
IN COMMUNITIES RARELY SEEING A WOMAN 
THESE ARE THE WORDS OF A MEDIEVAL ABBOT WRITING TO A YOUNG MONK 
MY EYES LONG TO SEE YOUR FACE MOST BELOVED 
MY ARMS STRETCH OUT TO YOUR EMBRACES 
MY LIPS LONG FOR YOUR KISSES 
WHATEVER REMAINS OF ME OF LIFE 
DESIRES YOUR COMPANY TO MAKE MY SOUL'S JOY COMPLETE FOR THE FUTURE 
SUCH WORDS SOUND EROTIC TO THE MODERN EAR 
YET SUCH LANGUAGE WAS NOT UNCOMMON BETWEEN MEN AT THE TIME 
IT DIDN'T EVEN IMPLY A PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP 
IN FACT THESE ARE THE WORDS 
OF PERHAPS THE MOST VIRULENT CAMPAIGNER AGAINST THE SIN OF SODOMY 
ANSELM ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY 
ACCORDING TO ANSELM 
THIS DEADLY VICE WAS SPREADING THROUGHOUT ENGLAND 
THE COUNTRY HE WARNED WAS THREATENED WITH THE FATE 
OF THE LUSTFUL INHABITANTS OF SODOM AND GOMORRAH 
FEW HISTORIANS HAVE STUDIED THIS DARK CHAPTER OF MEDIEVAL REPRESSION 
ONE WHO HAS IS BOB MILLS' 
THE BIBLE ACCOUNT IN GENESIS 
TELLS OF HOW BECAUSE OF THE SINS OF THE INHABITANTS OF THESE CITIES 
GOD RAINS DOWN BRIMSTONE AND FIRE UPON SODOM AND GOMORRAH 
AND DESTROYS ALL OF THE CITY'S INHABITANTS 
THE PENALTIES IN MEDIEVAL SOCIETY ARE MEANT IN SOME WAYS TO REFLECT 
THE PENALTIES IMPOSED BY GOD ON THE ORIGINAL SODOMITES 
FEARING DIVINE RETRIBUTION MEDIEVAL SOCIETY INFLICTED 
SAVAGE PUNISHMENTS ON ANY KIND OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR DEEMED UNNATURAL 
IN PORTUGAL AND CASTILE CASTRATION IS IMPOSED AS A PENALTY 
IN SIENA THE PENALTY IS TO BE HANGED BY ONE'S VIRILE MEMBERS 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT IN BOLOGNA THE PENALTY IS DEATH BY BURNING 
SODOMITES IN THE AFTERLIFE FARED NO BETTER 
THERE ARE CERTAIN IMAGES IN LATE MEDIEVAL ITALY 
WHICH SHOW SODOMITES ACTUALLY BEING BURNED ETERNALLY IN HELL 
AND ONE OF THESE IMAGES SHOWS A SODOMITE BEING PENETRATED 
FROM THE ANUS THROUGH TO THE MOUTH AND IN A SENSE BEING SPIT ROASTED 
BY A DEVIL WHO'S SORT OF TURNING THE SPIT 
THE OTHER END OF THE ROD THEN COMES OUT OF HIS MOUTH 
AND INTO THE MOUTH OF ANOTHER FIGURE WHO'S SITTING BESIDE HIM 
SO THERE'S A CLEAR ALLUSION HERE 
TO THE WAYS IN WHICH THE PENALTIES FOR SODOMY 
MIRROR THE SEXUAL PRACTICES OF THE SODOMITES 
SO WE'VE GOT AN ALLUSION TO ANAL SEX AND THE PENETRATION OF THE ANUS 
AND THEN THE PENETRATION OF THE MOUTH ALLUDES TO ORAL SEX 
IN LATE FOURTEENTH CENTURY PERUGIA 
THERE'S AN ITALIAN LAST JUDGEMENT PLAY 
WHICH DESCRIBES THE VARIOUS PENALTIES 
THAT ARE GOING TO BE INFLICTED ON SINNERS IN HELL 
AT THE VERY CLIMAX OF THIS PLAY CHRIST DESCRIBES THE PUNISHMENTS FOR THE SODOMITES 
YOU STINKING SODOMITE HAVE CRUCIFIED ME NIGHT AND DAY 
GO QUICKLY TO HELL TO STAY A WHILE AMID THOSE PUNISHMENTS 
PUT HIM QUICKLY IN THAT GREAT HEAT SINCE HE HAS SINNED AGAINST NATURE 
YOU CURSED SODOMITES 
ROAST LIKE LITTLE PIGGIES 
THEN SATAN TELLS ONE OF THE DEVILS TO GIVE THE ROAST A GOOD TURNING 
SO A VERY EXPLICIT ILLUSION TO THE IDEA OF THE SPIT ROASTED SODOMITE 
PUNISHMENT FOR SUCH UNBRIDLED SEXUAL ABERRATION AWAITED CHRISTIAN EUROPE 
SO CLAIMED THE PROPHETS OF DOOM 
AND THEY WOULD SOON CLAIM A TERRIBLE VINDICATION 
IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT WILLIAM OF EDENDON BISHOP OF WINCHESTER WROTE TO ALL THE CLERGY IN HIS DIOCESE 
WE REPORT WITH ANGUISH THE NEWS WHICH HAS COME TO OUR EARS 
THAT A CRUEL PLAGUE HAS BEGUN A SAVAGE ATTACK 
ON THE COASTAL AREAS OF ENGLAND 
ALTHOUGH GOD OFTEN STRIKES US TO JUSTLY PUNISH OUR SINS 
IT IS NOT WITHIN THE POWER OF MAN TO UNDERSTAND THE DIVINE PLAN 
BUT IT IS TO BE FEARED THAT HUMAN SENSUALITY 
THAT FIRE WHICH BLAZED UP AS A RESULT OF ADAM'S SIN 
HAS NOW PLUMBED GREATER DEPTHS OF EVIL 
PRODUCING A MULTITUDE OF SINS 
WHICH HAVE PROVOKED THE DIVINE ANGER TO THIS REVENGE 
THE BLACK DEATH KILLED HALF THE POPULATION OF EUROPE 
THOSE INFECTED SWELLED UP WITH BOILS THE SIZE OF EGGS OR APPLES 
THEY VOMITED BLACK AND GREEN FLUID THEY COUGHED UP BLOOD 
AND IT CONDEMNED THEM TO A QUICK AND PAINFUL DEATH 
RELATIONSHIPS FELL APART 
BROTHER FORSOOK BROTHER UNCLE NEPHEW SISTER BROTHER 
AND OFTENTIMES WIFE HUSBAND 
LAMENTED THE POET BOCCACCIO 
FOR THE BISHOP OF ROCHESTER THOMAS BRINTON THE ONSET OF PLAGUE 
WAS DUE PUNISHMENT FOR THE SINS OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES 
THERE IS ON EVERY SIDE SO MUCH LECHERY AND ADULTERY 
THAT FEW MEN ARE CONTENTED WITH THEIR OWN WIVES 
BUT EACH MAN LUSTS AFTER THE WIFE OF HIS NEIGHBOUR 
OR KEEPS A STINKING CONCUBINE 
BEHAVIOUR WHICH MERITS A HORRIBLE AND WRETCHED DEATH 
THE BLACK DEATH WAS A FOURTEENTH CENTURY APOCALYPSE 
BUT IT WAS TRAGICALLY OF A PIECE WITH SO MUCH OF LIFE 
AS IT WAS LIVED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT GREAT DIVIDE 
WHICH SEPARATES THE MODERN WORLD FROM A MORE DANGEROUS PAST 
THE MEDIEVAL WORLD EXISTED FAR MORE PRECARIOUSLY THAN OUR OWN 
A COMPLEX WORLD OF PASSION AND ROMANCE 
MISOGYNY AND CRUELTY 
INFANT DEATH AND EVERLASTING LOVE 
PIETY AND POETRY 
VIRGINS WEDDED TO CHRIST 
AND PRIESTS WEDDED TO THE PLEASURES OF THE FLESH 
A LIFE THAT WAS IT MUST BE SAID 
NASTY FOR SOME 
SHORT FOR MANY 
BUT BRUTISH NOT AT ALL
