BEFORE WORLD WAR ONE PEOPLE FLOCKED HERE TO HARROGATE 
TO ENJOY THE FAMOUS SPA WATERS 
BUT TODAY HOWEVER THEY'RE FLOCKING IN IN THEIR DROVES 
TO ENJOY A LITTLE BIT OF FLOG IT 
HARROGATE'S PAST AS A SPA TOWN 
OF INTERNATIONAL REPUTE IS STILL VERY MUCH IN EVIDENCE 
HERE WE HAVE THE ENTRANCE TO THE ROYAL PUMP ROOMS 
WHICH HOUSES THE STRONGEST SULPHUR WELL IN EUROPE 
WHICH IS RENOWNED FOR ITS MEDICINAL PURPOSES 
TODAY'S VALUATION COMES FROM ANOTHER BUILDING OF THAT ERA 
THE MARVELLOUS CAIRN HOTEL 
THERE'S A BIG QUEUE AND EXPERTS JAMES LEWIS AND THOMAS CLARK 
ARE INSPECTING THE ITEMS PEOPLE HAVE BROUGHT 
IT LOOKS LIKE JAMES HAS ALREADY FOUND SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING 
MARY ALBERT WHENEVER WE SEE ONE OF THESE 
WE KNOW EITHER YOU OR SOMEBODY IN YOUR PAST 
IS SOMETHING TO DO WITH MEDICINE CORRECT 
YES 
IS THIS A FAMILY THING OR HAVE YOU BOUGHT IT 
ALBERT BOUGHT IT FOR ME JUST AFTER WE WERE MARRIED FORTY YEARS AGO 
AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH MEDICAL SO 
PHARMACISTS DOCTORS I'M A PHARMACY TECHNICIAN HE'S A DOCTOR 
BRILLIANT 
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS AN APOTHECARY CABINET 
IT'S THE SORT OF THING IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
SOME PEOPLE SAY THEY WERE FOR TRAVELLING DOCTORS 
OR PHARMACISTS WHO GO AROUND 
AND DO THEIR BEST FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNITY 
FOR THE ODD PAYMENT HERE AND THERE 
ANOTHER THEORY WHICH I HAVE TO SAY IS SOMETHING 
THAT I AGREE WITH IS THAT THESE WERE A FAMILY MEDICAL CABINET 
TO BE USED AT HOME OH RIGHT SO I DON'T THINK 
EVERYBODY WHO USED THESE WERE DOCTORS AND PHARMACISTS 
IF WE LOOK AT THIS ONE TAKE THE DRAWER OPEN 
THIS ONE HAS GOT OINTMENT JARS 
IT'S GOT A LITTLE BURNER 
THAT'S DATED YES 
NINETEEN OH ONE YES SO 
THIS WOULD'VE BEEN SOMETHING THAT WOULD'VE EVOLVED 
AND BEEN USED OVER A PERIOD OF TIME THIS CABINET 
ISN'T NINETEEN OH ONE IT'S ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY GOODNESS IT'S A WONDERFUL THING 
FORTY YEARS AGO DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU PAID FOR IT YOU WON'T SAY 
I THINK IT WAS IN THE REGION OF TWENTY 
YEAH THAT'S NOT BAD 
NO THE MARKET FOR THIS SORT OF THING 
IS GOOD BUT THEN WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE ORIGINALITY 
NOW ALL THESE BOTTLES ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT 
YES AT LEAST A LOT OF THEM ARE THAT ONE DOESN'T MATCH THAT ONE 
THAT ONE 
AND THAT DIDN'T START LIFE IN THERE EITHER 
BUT IT'S A GOOD THING WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH 
ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY NO IDEA AT ALL 
HAS IT KEPT PACE WITH INFLATION THAT'S THE THING 
IT HAS KEPT PACE WITH INFLATION 
I THINK IT'LL DO MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY I HOPE IT WILL DO DOUBLE THAT 
I THINK TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED 
IT'S NICE TO GIVE THE AUCTIONEER THAT LITTLE BIT OF FREEDOM 
IF WE PUT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY AS A RESERVE 
LEAVE THEM WITH SOME DISCRETION THEN THEY CAN FLOW THEN 
THE MORE PEOPLE WE GET INTERESTED IN THE BEGINNING 
THE MORE PEOPLE WE'LL GET BIDDING AT THE END 
SO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY RESERVE TEN PER CENT DISCRETION ON THAT DON'T FORGET YOU'VE GOT 
YOUR AUCTIONEER'S FEES TO PAY AS WELL YES THAT NORMALLY 
ADDS UP TO ABOUT FIFTEEN PER CENT BY THE TIME YOU'VE GOT THE VAT AND INSURANCE 
I THINK IT'LL DO VERY WELL EXCELLENT THANK YOU THANK YOU 
THIS HAS HAD A BIT OF A JOURNEY TODAY YOU HAD A FALL DIDN'T YOU 
YES ARE YOU ALL RIGHT NOW I'M O. K. THANK YOU 
YOU'VE BROUGHT THIS ROYAL WORCESTER YES WITH A PAINTED PHEASANT ON 
IT'S PAINTED BY STINTON WHICH IS GREAT 
TELL ME ABOUT IT WELL IT WAS 
IT BELONGED TO MY GREAT AUNT 
WHEN SHE DIED THE WHOLE FAMILY VARIOUS REPRESENTATIVES 
WENT AND PICKED WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE 
AND MY MOTHER SAW THIS AND FELL IN LOVE WITH IT AND BROUGHT IT HOME 
AND WHEN YOUR MOTHER 
WELL MY MOTHER DIED ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO NOW 
BUT SHE WAS ONE HUNDRED ONE 
ONE HUNDRED ONE THAT'S AMAZING 
SO I INHERITED IT 
AND DO YOU LIKE IT 
I THINK IT'S VERY NICE BUT BECAUSE OF THE THOUGHT 
OF TWO HUNDRED SITTING ON YOUR SHELF AND ME KNOCKING IT OFF I'M ACCIDENT PRONE 
DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH TWO HUNDRED 
SO I WAS TOLD OH 
I THOUGHT THE MONEY WOULD DO THE CHURCH MORE GOOD THAN ME 
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO WITH THE MONEY WHAT CHURCH IS THAT 
MEANWOOD CHURCH IN LEEDS 
WELL IT PROBABLY IS WORTH ABOUT TWO HUNDRED 
BUT PROBABLY WORTH A BIT MORE NOW 
IF WE KEEP THAT FIGURE AT TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED I THINK THAT'S REALLY SENSIBLE 
AND WE FIX THE RESERVE AROUND ABOUT THAT YES 
BUT LET'S FIRST IT'S A NICE HAND PAINTED STINTON 
VASE BY ROYAL WORCESTER IT'S ACTUALLY NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT 
WITH THIS MARK MADE IN ENGLAND AH 
IT'S UNUSUAL BECAUSE IT'S PHEASANTS AS WELL RATHER THAN COWS 
THE CHURCH'LL GET THE MONEY WHAT DO THEY NEED A NEW ROOF 
DO THEY NEED TO PAY FOR THEIR NO THEY HAVE A BUILDING PROJECT 
TO MAKE IT SUITABLE FOR DISABLED PEOPLE GETTING IN 
SO IT'S COST THEM A VAST AMOUNT OF MONEY 
THEY STILL HAVE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TO RAISE REALLY 
SO IT'LL HELP IT'LL BE A DROP IN THE OCEAN BUT UM 
STILL EVERY PENNY HELPS YES 
LET'S PUT IT UP FOR AUCTION TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED AS I'VE SAID 
RESERVE AT TWO HUNDRED AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS YES 
O. K. YES THANK YOU FOR COMING RIGHT 
DAVID AND SUSIE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING IN FURNITURE 
IT'S MY PASSION SO TELL ME ITS HISTORY AND WHY IS IT HERE 
WELL I BOUGHT IT IN A JUNK SHOP 
ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO 
AND I ALWAYS LIKED THE PIECE 
ER YOU TOOK IT HOME 
TO SUSIE YES 
SADLY SUSIE DOESN'T LIKE IT NO IT'S NOT A PIECE THAT'S 
WHERE IS IT IN THE HOUSE IN THE HALL OR THE SITTING ROOM 
WE'RE NOT USING IT AT THE MOMENT 
WE RECENTLY MOVED SO WE HAVEN'T FOUND A PLACE FOR IT 
IT'S LIKE A MODERN DIRECTOR'S CHAIR OUR DIRECTOR SHOULD BE IN IT 
WITH HIS NAME ON THE BACK AS YOU CAN SEE IT FOLDS UP 
SO IT STOPS ALL RIGHT 
MIND YOU IT IS SOME LUMP 
IT'S A TYPICAL ITALIAN RENAISSANCE CHAIR 
THESE CHAIRS WERE FOUND IN CATHEDRALS AND CHURCHES A HIGH SEAT OF LEARNING VERY IMPORTANT 
KNOWN AS X. FRAME CHAIRS NOW THIS HAS GOT A MIXTURE OF STYLES 
A LOT OF CLASSICAL DESIGN INTO ONE THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE GOOD AT 
I CAN ACTUALLY GO THROUGH SOME OF THE CLASSICAL DETAIL 
IT WAS MADE BY A JOINER THE JOINERS WORKED 
IN CLOSE HARMONY WITH WOOD CARVERS 
AND YOU CAN DATE ENGLISH FURNITURE PURELY BY ITS DECORATION 
ITS RUNNING ORNAMENTATION THIS IS TYPICAL OF AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY PIECE OF FURNITURE 
THESE BOSSES ARE TYPICAL OF A NINETEENTH CENTURY PIECE OF FURNITURE 
THESE LOVELY RED ROSE AND OAK LEAF INLAID BOSSES 
ARE TYPICAL OF AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY PIECE OF FURNITURE 
LOOKING AT THE BOTTOM IT IS TYPICAL OF VICTORIAN 
ESPECIALLY WITH THESE BIG BOLD LION CLAW FEET 
IT'S NOT ITALIAN RENAISSANCE IT'S NOT ENGLISH RENAISSANCE 
IT IS OF AN ITALIAN DESIGN 
AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL 
IF YOU COULD PUT SOME TURKEY WORK BACK ON HERE IT'D HAVE THE LOOK 
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO VALUE BECAUSE 
IF WE PUT IT IN TO AUCTION WE'VE GOT TO PUT AN ESTIMATE ON IT 
WHICH WILL ENCOURAGE ALL THE INTERIOR DESIGNERS AND DEALERS 
I'D LIKE TO PUT IT INTO AUCTION WITH A VALUE ON IT OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
I PRAY THIS GETS AROUND FIVE HUNDRED SIX HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED 
BUT WE'VE GOT TO PUT IT IN AT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
I'LL BE REALLY REALLY UPSET IF IT GOES FOR THAT 
BUT YOU WANT TO SEE IT GO SO WE'VE GOT TO PRICE IT TO GO 
IT'S TIME FOR IT TO GO TIME TO FIND IT A NEW HOME 
EVERYONE WHO COMES TO A VALUATION DAY GETS AN EXPERT OPINION 
AND IT KEEPS OUR SPECIALISTS BUSY 
AND THERE ARE ALWAYS SOME LOVELY SURPRISES 
JUST LIKE THE PIECES JAMES HAS JUST FOUND 
CHRISTINE AREN'T THESE FUN YES ARE YOU A BAKER NO 
WHY HAVE YOU GOT THEM THEY ACTUALLY BELONG TO MY FATHER 
HE'D BEEN GIVEN THEM BY AN ELDERLY NEIGHBOUR 
WHO HE USED TO POP IN AND SEE TO MAKE SURE SHE WAS ALL RIGHT WHY DOES HE WANT TO SELL THEM 
THEY'VE BEEN STUCK IN A CUPBOARD 
AND I THINK HE'S BEEN TIDYING UP A BIT 
NOT MUCH POINT HAVING THEM IN A CUPBOARD NO NO 
THESE ARE GREAT THEY DON'T LOOK A LOT DO THEY 
THEY'RE BY THE WADE FACTORY THESE WERE PRODUCED BETWEEN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE AND NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT 
THERE'S NOT A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THEM 
WHENEVER WE LOOK AT WADE THERE'S A BOOK 
YOU CAN LOOK IT UP IT'S GOT A REFERENCE NUMBER 
WHICH TELLS YOU WHEN IT WAS MADE WHO DESIGNED IT 
ALL ABOUT IT WHAT SET IT WAS FROM AND HOW MUCH IT'S WORTH 
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO VALUE THESE NO 
THESE ARE FROM A SET OF THREE BUTCHER BAKER AND CANDLESTICK MAKER 
YOU'VE GOT TWO BAKERS YOU'RE MISSING THE OTHERS 
BUT THEY'RE A GOOD SET AND THEY'RE A RARE SET 
ONLY MADE FOR FIVE YEARS THE COLLECTOR'S MARKET IS BUOYANT FOR THEM 
A GOOD PAIR LIKE THAT I THINK THEY'RE GONNA MAKE ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
OH 
IS THAT GOOD YOU'RE LOOKING PLEASED 
YEAH YEAH SUPER 
THE THING IS FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS MADE FIFTY YEARS AGO 
CHEAPLY MADE AS WELL 
THESE WEREN'T EXPENSIVE WHEN THEY WERE DONE IT'S BEEN A FANTASTIC INVESTMENT 
REALLY GOOD THINGS

ALL RIGHT FINE LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS YEAH

YORK IS FULL OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL GEORGIAN ARCHITECTURE 
BUT THE PLACE I'M JUST ABOUT TO SHOW YOU HAS GOT TO POSSIBLY BE ITS FINEST EXAMPLE 
IT PLAYS A VERY IMPORTANT PART IN THE CITY'S CULTURAL AND ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE 
AND IT STANDS AS IT WAS WHEN IT WAS FIRST BUILT IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN THROUGH MANY INCARNATIONS 
FAIRFAX HOUSE WAS ORIGINALLY BOUGHT BY VISCOUNT JOHN FAIRFAX 
HE SPENT EIGHT THOUSAND ON HAVING IT REFURBISHED 
THAT'S MORE THAN TWO MILLION IF YOU WERE TO WRITE THE CHEQUE TODAY 
THE HOUSE EVENTUALLY PASSED THROUGH SEVERAL FAMILIES BEFORE BECOMING A CINEMA AND A NIGHTCLUB 
MIRACULOUSLY MANY OF ITS ORIGINAL FEATURES SURVIVED DESPITE THIS TRANSFORMATION 
ITS FORTUNES CHANGED IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY WHEN NOEL TERRY OF TERRY'S CHOCOLATE 
BEQUEATHED HIS COLLECTION OF EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ENGLISH FURNITURE TO A CHARITABLE TRUST 
THIS WAS WIDELY RECOGNISED AS THE BEST PRIVATE COLLECTION IN THE COUNTRY 
AND EVENTUALLY FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE YORK CIVIC TRUST 
AND THE NEED FOR A SUITABLE VENUE TO DISPLAY THE COLLECTION GAVE RISE TO THE IDEA 
OF RESTORING FAIRFAX HOUSE TO ITS FORMER GLORY LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
AND HERE TO SHOW ME AROUND IS THE MUSEUM DIRECTOR PETER BROWN 
PETER WELCOME THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME OUT TO TALK TO US THIS MORNING IT'S A PLEASURE 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS USED TO BE AN OLD CINEMA 
I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE BUT 
PETER WHEN YOU CAME THROUGH HERE WAS THERE A BOX OFFICE HERE 
IT WAS ALL BOXED IN HERE WITH SHUTTERING O. K. AND NIGHTCLUB COLOURS ON THE WALLS 
BLUES AND REDS 
A VICTORIAN FLOOR HERE 
AND BASICALLY CENTURIES OF PAINT 
BUT FUNNILY ENOUGH THE PAINT PRESERVED IT 
HOW MANY LAYERS WERE THERE 
SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN LAYERS OF PAINT MY WORD 
AND THEN WE HAD TEAMS OF UM YOUNG LADS YES SCRAPING THE PAINT OFF THE CEILINGS 
WE'VE WORKED IT OUT IT WAS TWENTY THOUSAND MAN HOURS JUST TO CLEAN THE CEILINGS ALONE 
MY WORD 
THE ROOMS THAT LEAD OFF OF THIS HALL MY EYES ARE VYING FOR ATTENTION 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO GO THAT WAY THIS WAY OR THAT WAY WHICH DO YOU THINK 
I THINK WE SHOULD GO THROUGH HERE AFTER YOU THANK YOU 
OH GOSH LOOK AT THIS 
IT CERTAINLY DOES HAVE THE WOW FACTOR 
HOW DID YOU KNOW THIS WAS A DINING ROOM WHEN IT WAS IN SUCH A DILAPIDATED STATE 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A DRAWING ROOM YES BUT ONCE WE STARTED TO GET THE PAINT OFF THE CEILINGS 
WE STARTED TO REVEAL ALL THESE WONDERFUL SYMBOLS 
THE LADY IN THE MIDDLE FOR EXAMPLE IS AVONDANTIA WITH HER CORNUCOPIA 
THERE ARE WINE GLASSES OF THE PLENTY ABSOLUTELY SO YOU'RE MEANT TO DINE HERE 
MUSIC ABOVE HER HEAD 
WINE GLASSES LOOKING AT THE CORNICE 
IT LOOKS REALLY AUSTERE IT LOOKS OUT OF PLACE WITH THE STUCCO WORK ALL THIS LOVELY ROCOCO GOING ON 
IT'S FINE THE SWAGS THE RIBBONS BUT WHY IS THAT SO SORT OF BLAND 
IT'S CALLED THE DORIC ALBANO AND THESE LITTLE GUTTAE LOOK A BIT 
LIKE CHAMPAGNE CORKS IT'S WHERE WE GET THE WORD GUTTER FROM 
THAT'S A LOVELY STORY I NEVER KNEW THAT'S WHERE THE TERM GUTTERING CAME FROM 
IT'S CERTAINLY A TALKING POINT YOU THINK THESE CEILINGS ARE GOOD 
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE ONES ON THE GREAT STAIRCASE THIS WAY THAT WAY 
AN AMAZING STAIRCASE WITH WONDERFUL BALUSTRADES GORGEOUS 
BUT HOW ABOUT THAT FOR A WINDOW 
IT'S STUNNING IT'S PROBABLY THE BEST VENETIAN WINDOW YOU'LL SEE IN THE COUNTRY 
WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE REST OF THE STAIRCASE CEILING AND THE BRACKETS ON THE WALLS 
LOTS OF SYMBOLISM HERE CAN YOU DECIPHER IT I'VE SPENT SOME TIME 
LOOKING AT IT AND THE MEDALLIONS THERE ARE PREGNANT WITH IMAGERY 
WHICH RELATE NOT ONLY TO THE ROMAN CATHOLIC FAITH 
AS FAIRFAX WAS A CATHOLIC 
BUT ALSO PERHAPS DANGEROUSLY TO THE JACOBITE CAUSE 
PETER THE HOUSE IS AN ARCHITECTURAL DELIGHT AND IT CERTAINLY IS WORTH LOOKING AROUND 
BUT YOU KNOW MY MAIN PASSION IS FURNITURE DO YOU MIND IF I GO BACK DOWNSTAIRS 
AS I SPOTTED A FEW CHOICE PIECES WHILE I WAS LOOKING ROUND AND BE NOSY BE OUR GUEST THANK YOU 
I'VE GOT TO SHOW YOU THIS WE'VE SEEN BUREAU BOOKCASES ON THE SHOW BEFORE 
BUT NEVER LIKE THIS IT'S A DOUBLE DOME BOOKCASE 
YOU CAN SEE WHY BY VIRTUE OF THE SHAPE OF THE UPPER SECTION 
THIS IS ENGLISH 
ITS CONSTRUCTION IS OF MAHOGANY BUT IT'S BEEN VENEERED THROUGHOUT 
EVERY FACE SURFACE WITH WALNUT VERY FASHIONABLE IN ITS DAY 
AND THIS DATES BACK TO ABOUT ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TEN LET ME SHOW YOU THIS O. K. 
JUST PULL THESE LOPERS OUT HERE IT'S GOT A LOVELY KNEEHOLE DESK SECTION 
THIS IS THE FALL FRONT WHICH DROPS DOWN HERE 
SO YOU CAN SIT HERE AND WRITE AWAY 
IT IS MIGHTY FINE ISN'T IT BUT IT GETS BETTER IF I OPEN THESE DOORS 
VERY CAREFULLY AND IT'S A REAL HONOUR TO BE ABLE TO TOUCH SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
IT IS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE FINEST PIECES OF FURNITURE I'VE SEEN IN MY LIFE 
AND IF WE START AT THE TOP UP HERE 
EACH ONE OF THESE PULLS OUT THERE'S VOIDS THERE SO YOU CAN HIDE THINGS IN THEM 
AT THE BASE OF THE COLUMNS THERE ARE ALSO SECRET COMPARTMENTS 
WHERE A GENTLEMAN MAY HIDE HIS WILL LADIES COULD HIDE LOVE LETTERS 
IN FACT THERE'S A WHITE ONE NOTE 
STASHED AWAY IN THERE 
BUT THE BEST SECRET COMPARTMENT OF ALL AND IT'S NOT OBVIOUS THIS ONE 
IS THIS SECTION HERE AS THERE'S A VOID AT THE BACK SO YOU COULD HIDE LOTS OF THINGS BEHIND THERE 
AND YOU JUST PULL THE WHOLE SECTION OUT LIKE THAT 
ISN'T THAT BRILLIANT I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT 
AND I WOULD LOVE TO OWN IT 
TO UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE ANTIQUES AT THEIR VERY BEST 
YOU HAVE TO SEE THEM IN THEIR CORRECT SURROUNDINGS AND FOR ME FAIRFAX HOUSE HAS IT ALL 
IT CONTAINS THE BEST COLLECTION OF ANTIQUE FURNITURE I'VE EVER SEEN 
RIGHT NOW IT'S TIME TO RETURN BACK TO THE VALUATION DAY AND I WONDER WHAT'S BEEN COLLECTED THERE 
SUSAN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IN THIS CHARLOTTE RHEAD VASE O. K. 
HOW DID YOU COME BY IT IT STARTED OUT IN LIFE AS MY GRANDMA'S 
THEN TO MY MOTHER THEN TO MY FATHER AND HE PASSED AWAY 
AND SO MY BROTHER AND MYSELF WE DON'T REALLY WANT IT 
SO WE'D LIKE TO SELL IT AND SHARE THE PROCEEDS AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE WITH THE MONEY 
WHEN PEOPLE FORCE THINGS UPON YOU IT'S AWFULLY CRUEL IT IS LIKE OTHER PEOPLE'S FURNITURE 
YOU CAN END UP WITH A HOUSE FULL OF STUFF YOU DON'T WANT 
THIS IS THE CASE YES 
I THINK YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING WE KNOW IT'S CHARLOTTE RHEAD 
AS IT'S ON THE BOTTOM CROWN DUCAL 
IT'S GOT THAT SCRIPT MARK FOR CROWN DUCAL 
WHICH MEANS IT'S A NINETEEN THIRTIES POT RIGHT BUT WE CAN TELL IT'S NINETEEN THIRTIES 
JUST BY THE DECORATION O. K. 
CAN YOU REMEMBER AT YOUR GRANDMA'S OR YOUR MUM'S 
DID IT HAVE FLOWERS IN UMBRELLAS 
UMBRELLAS NO WAY YES IT USED TO BE ON THE FLOOR WITH UMBRELLAS IN 
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT YOU MUST HAVE HAD A VERY CALM HOUSE 
VERY MILD MANNERED I JUST REMEMBER AS A LITTLE GIRL 
UMBRELLAS IN IT 
THIS IS A RATHER IMPRESSIVE VASE 
AND I'M QUITE INTERESTED THAT IT'S A RIBBED BODY THAT'S GOOD NEWS 
PEOPLE LIKE THAT IT GIVES IT ITS RIGHT AGE ETC RIGHT STYLE 
COS THE THIRTIES DECO WASN'T SO ANGULAR AS THE TWENTIES DECO SO IT'S ALL A BIT MORE ROUNDED 
I THINK WE'LL GET BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND TWO HUNDRED FOR YOU 
RIGHT HOW DOES THAT GRAB YOU 
FINE YES YEAH YEAH BRILLIANT 
AND SO AS REGARDS TO RESERVE 
I'D PUT A DISCRETIONARY RESERVE IN AT NINETY O. K. 
GOD IT'S GOTTA BE WORTH THAT IT'S A LOVELY THING 
ALL RIGHT YES THAT'S FINE THANK YOU 
JACKIE SIMON DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS AND WHAT IT'S USED FOR 
NO NO SO HOW COME YOU'VE GOT IT 
IT WAS LEFT IN THE HOUSE BUT IT WAS IN THE GARAGE 
IT'S BEEN THERE FOR WHAT TEN YEARS 
THAT'S THE HOUSE YOU BOUGHT YES AND YOU FOUND IT DID YOU 
YEAH JUST AT THE BACK OF THE GARAGE NOT A BAD LITTLE FIND 
WELL OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE IN THEIR GARAGE 
EITHER THAT OR THEY JUST STORED IT THERE THAT'S WHAT IT'S FOR 
BAROGRAPHS STARTED BEING USED AROUND THE MID NINETEENTH CENTURY AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY 
THEY WERE INVENTED BY A CHAP CALLED LUCIEN VIDIE 
HE INVENTED THE BAROGRAPH AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY BUT THIS ONE WAS PROBABLY MADE AROUND NINETEEN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE 
AND THESE WERE USED TO RECORD ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE YOU GO INTO MUSEUMS AND ART GALLERIES 
YOU OFTEN FIND THERE'LL BE ONE OF THESE 
STUCK IN THE CORNER TO ENSURE THE PAINTINGS ARE IN THE RIGHT CONDITIONS 
IF WE LIFT THE LID THERE WE HAVE A LOVELY MAKER'S MARK THERE 
NEGRETTI AND ZAMBRA OF LONDON 
AND THEY WERE ONE OF THE BEST MAKERS 
OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS AND IF YOU'VE GOT A BAROGRAPH 
THERE'S NO BETTER MAKER 
IT'S HAD ITS PROBLEMS THOUGH 
A LITTLE BIT OF DAMAGE HERE AND THERE BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY 
THERE'S NOTHING THERE THAT CAN'T BE PUT RIGHT THE WAY IT WOULD WORK 
IS THAT THE LITTLE COIL IN THERE HAS GOT AIR IN IT 
AND THE AIR IS REMOVED FROM THE CYLINDER AND CAUSES A PRESSURE 
AS THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE CHANGES THAT MOVES THE NEEDLE 
THAT GOES UP AND DOWN HERE AND THE CYLINDER IS CLOCKWORK SO THIS TURNS 
AND YOU'D HAVE A PAPER LABEL ON THE OUTSIDE WITH A GRAPH 
AND YOU CAN ALTER THE SPEED OF THIS ROTATING SO YOU CAN HAVE ONE ROTATION PER DAY 
OR ONE ROTATION PER WEEK OR EVEN ONE ROTATION PER MONTH 
IT WILL RECORD THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE OF THE DAY AND OF THE TIME 
UM WHAT ESTIMATE WHAT DO YOU THINK I'VE NO IDEA 
SELL IT FOR TWENTY WELL MAYBE A BIT MORE TWENTY FIVE 
TWENTY FIVE H. M. M. YOU'D BE VERY SILLY TO SELL IT FOR TWENTY FIVE 
YEAH IT'S WORTH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
LOVELY NOT BAD FOR A FIND IN THE GARAGE NO 
SO WE NEED TO PROTECT IT WITH A RESERVE WHAT SHALL WE SAY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
YEAH LOVELY DON'T LET IT GO AT ANY LESS IF IT GOES FOR LESS SAVE IT FOR ANOTHER SALE 
SO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED ESTIMATE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY RESERVE THANK YOU GREAT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING TODAY 
AND UM BRINGING THIS ALBUM OF POSTCARDS 
TELL ME HOW DID YOU COME ABOUT THEM 
THEY'VE BEEN IN THE FAMILY A LONG TIME

SO I'VE GOT THEM WHAT'S AMAZING IS THE CONDITION OF THE ALBUM 
TO BEGIN WITH IT'S SUPER LOVELY 
LOVELY CONDITION NORMALLY YOU SEE THESE ALBUMS AND THEY'RE TATTY 
AND THIS IS A LOVELY ART NOUVEAU STYLE HERE WITH THE FLOWERS ETC 
UM WHAT'S EVEN MORE INTERESTING IS WHAT'S INSIDE 
THE ALBUM IS AWASH WITH POSTCARDS AND PHOTOGRAPHS 
FROM THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS NINETEEN TEN NINETEEN TWENTY 
SOME PRE WAR ONES THIS IS A LOVELY ONE WE FOUND AS WELL 
THE BRIDLINGTON EXCELSIOR PRIZE SILVER BAND THERE THEY ALL ARE 
WITH THEIR PRIZE THERE 
FANTASTIC ISN'T IT YES IT'S A REALLY LOVELY LOCAL POSTCARD ALBUM 
PICTURE POSTCARDS WITH PEOPLE IN IT AS WELL IT'S FANTASTIC 
THIS IS A LOVELY ONE ISN'T IT YEAH IT'S GOT EAST WARD 
THE ELECTIONS HERE NINETEEN OH THREE NOVEMBER SECOND 
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DATE FOR YOU YES THAT'S MY BIRTHDAY 
AND HILL HENRY WAS THAT A RELATION 
UM COULD BE HILL IS THE FAMILY NAME 
REALLY WHY DID YOU BRING IT IN TODAY 
UM I THOUGHT WITH IT BEING LOCAL 
THERE'S SOME OF HARROGATE AND PANNAL IN THERE AND WAS IT SOMETHING YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT SELLING 
YES I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO YES 
I WOULD LIKE TO PUT AN ESTIMATE ON IT OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED 
WOW RIGHT 
HAPPY WITH THAT YES 
IT'S JUST A FANTASTIC ALBUM SO AT THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED 
IF WE HAVE A RESERVE AT THREE HUNDRED 
HOW DOES THAT GRAB YOU SOUNDS ALL RIGHT 
IF IT FALLS ON THE RESERVE AND WE SELL FOR THREE HUNDRED 
WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THE MONEY 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW I MIGHT PUT IT TO A HOLIDAY 
YEAH OR BUY SOMETHING ELSE TO REMEMBER THE FAMILY BY YES 
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS BUT IT'S A LOVELY ALBUM AND THANK YOU THANK YOU 
ONCE USED AS AN UMBRELLA STAND WILL SUSAN'S CHARLOTTE RHEAD VASE BE LEFT HIGH AND DRY 
WITH A RESERVE OF NINETY 
JACKIE AND SIMON FOUND THIS BAROGRAPH IN THE GARAGE TEN YEARS AGO 
WILL IT WEATHER THE PREDICTION OF FETCHING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PRESSURE'S ON 
AND FINALLY JANET'S MAGNIFICENT POSTCARD COLLECTION 
IS IN GREAT CONDITION LET'S HOPE THE BUYERS THINK IT'S WORTH SOMETHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT 
JANET'S PHOTO COLLECTION WE'VE GOT A VALUATION OF THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED ON THIS 
BUT THERE'S A LIMITED AMOUNT OF LOCAL INTEREST HERE 
BECAUSE IT SPANS EVERYTHING DURHAM WINDSOR CASTLE 
TOPOGRAPHIC SCENES ALL OF THE U. K. REALLY 
THERE ARE A FEW LOCAL ONES SOME YORK ONES BUT NOT THAT MANY WHICH IS A SHAME 
I THINK AS SO OFTEN WITH THESE THINGS THEY SELL BEST IN THEIR OWN AREA 
SO IF YOU HAD AN ALBUM OF YORKSHIRE CARDS THEY'D SELL LIKE MAD 
BUT WHEN YOU GET A MIXED ALBUM LIKE THIS NOT SO EASY TO SELL 
THIS'LL BE A STRUGGLE AT THREE HUNDRED I AGREE WITH YOU PAUL 
I THINK WE ARE GONNA STRUGGLE 
YOU COULD BUY THESE CARDS INDIVIDUALLY FOR TEN P. TWENTY P. THIRTY P. 
IT'S THE WWI CARDS THE SILK ONES THAT FETCH AROUND SEVEN EACH 
THEN YOU KNOW YOU CAN EQUATE QUANTITY THAT'S RIGHT 
WE MIGHT BE ON A STICKY WICKET WITH THIS ONE 
ALL I CAN SAY IS GOOD LUCK 
FINGERS CROSSED WE WILL GET THAT BECAUSE THE MONEY IS GOING TOWARDS A HOLIDAY WE CAN'T DISAPPOINT JANET
