PIXIE PIXIE COME HERE GIRL 
I DON'T MIND DRIVING BACK IF YOU WANT ANOTHER GLASS 
GET UP GET UP 
DAD 
READY 
EVE OH RIGHT 
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT 
YES FINE THANKS 
O. K. 
ER LET'S GO 
SO THIS LEFT HAND WAS FOUND BY A DOG IN THE WOODS AND THE D. N. A. 
IS A MATCH TO THIS UNIDENTIFIED BODY THAT WAS FOUND A YEAR AGO 
IN BARTON WOODS ABOUT A MILE AWAY FROM WHERE THE HAND WAS FOUND 
WHAT WAS THE CONDITION OF THE BODY STRIPPED AND MINUS HEAD AND HANDS 
WHAT DID THE ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION COME UP WITH THEY TRIED TO LINK IT 
TO A SPATE OF GANGLAND KILLINGS WHERE THE VICTIMS' I. D.'S WERE SIMILARLY OBSCURED 
TRIED BUT FAILED PUTREFACTION WAS ADVANCED AND WITH NO HEAD OR HANDS 
SO WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS BLOB 
WE KNOW HE'S MALE WE KNOW HE'S LATE TEENS EARLY TWENTIES 
AND THAT HE WAS INTERRED APPROXIMATELY TWO YEARS AGO 
WHERE'S THE HEAD AND THE OTHER HAND A SEARCH DIDN'T REVEAL ANYTHING 
APART FROM THE DOG'S 
YEAH WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE FOX'S AND AS FOXES HAVE A TERRITORIAL RANGE OF ABOUT TWO KILOMETRES 
THE HEAD AND THE OTHER HAND COULD BE ANYWHERE WITHIN A TWO K. M. RADIUS OF THE PICNIC SITE THAT'S A HUGE AREA MM 
WHAT CHOPPED OFF THE HEAD AND HANDS THEN 
I DON'T KNOW YET BUT I TOOK AN X. RAY OF THE LEFT HAND 
AND THE OPAQUE AREAS REVEAL SMALL FRAGMENTS EMBEDDED IN THE TISSUE 
AND WHAT ARE THEY FROM IT'LL TAKE A COUPLE OF HOURS O. K. 
LET'S GO THROUGH THE MISSING PERSONS REPORTS AGAIN BUT THE PREVIOUS INVESTIGATION 
SOMEONE MIGHT'VE STARTED PINING FOR HIM 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS LET'S GO SPENCE THANKS THANK YOU 
BYE THANKS 
IT'S JUST THE WAY I AM O. K. I'D FEEL A BIT STUPID IF I NEVER ACTUALLY WENT TO SEE THE PLACE 
GO ON THEN LEAD THE WAY O. K. ALL RIGHT 
WERE YOU IN THE BOY SCOUTS NO THE BOYS' BRIGADE ACTUALLY BOYS' BRIGADE 
I DON'T HOW YOU WORK OUT WHICH TREE IS WHICH THEY ALL LOOK THE BLOODY SAME TO ME 
THERE IT IS 
THE REMAINS OF THE CORPSE WERE FOUND IN THIS SHALLOW GRAVE HERE RIGHT 
IT'S NOT A BAD SPOT IT'S REASONABLY REMOTE 
YOU COULD CARRY A BODY HERE FROM THE CAR PARK IF YOU USED A WHEELBARROW 
SO THE KILLER PROBABLY WORKS OR LIVES IN THE AREA WHY DO YOU SAY THAT 
MOST DEPOSITION SITES ARE LOCATED SOMEWHERE A KILLER KNOWS WELL 
THAT'S CLASSIC THAT IS SO CLASSIC WHAT THAT COMFORT ZONE THEORY IS JUST CLASSIC ARMCHAIR PROFILING 
DON'T YOU THINK THE MURDERERS HAVE COTTONED ON TO THAT ONE BY NOW 
ARE YOU TRYING TO PUT GRACE OUT OF A JOB I'D GO TO ABERDEEN OR SKEGNESS 
WITH A HEADLESS BLOOD SOAKED CORPSE I'D DUMP IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
HE DIDN'T DUMP IT HE BURIED IT AND DISMEMBERED IT 
THINK ABOUT THAT O. K. HOW CAN YOU FINE PEOPLE FOR LITTERING EH 
ANYTHING ELSE IN THE AREA YEAH THERE WAS ONE SERIOUS ASSAULT FOURTEEN MONTHS BEFORE THE BODY WAS FOUND 
A GERRY SAMUELS WAS ATTACKED AND KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS 
WAS THAT A ROBBERY NO HE STILL HAD HIS WALLET 
LOCAL POLICE FOUND HIM NEAR HIS CAR AFTER AN ANONYMOUS CALL 
FROM THE ATTACKER WELL THEY ASSUME SO BUT HE WAS NEVER CAUGHT 
WHAT TIME WAS IT 
UNMOTIVATED ATTACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE THAT'S BEYOND BAD LUCK 
WELL NOT THAT REMOTE 
HI HI 
I HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING FOR YOU YET 
OH NO NO IT'S O. K. 
OH DEAR ACTUALLY I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT BOYD 
BOYD MM 
IS THERE ANYTHING I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE BOY THAT HE MIGHT BE LOOKING FOR 
WHAT BOY WOULD IT BE IF HE WERE 
IT WOULD BE HIS SON 
I SEE 
HI GERRY SAMUELS GERRY SAMUELS THEY'RE POLISH MATE THEY WON'T UNDERSTAND YOU LOOKING FOR ME 
I'M DETECTIVE SUPERINTENDENT BOYD THIS IS DI JORDAN 
O. I. TOMEK I TOLD YOU I NEED YOU SHIFTING THAT STUFF NOW PRONTO 
YOU GOING TO PAY ATTENTION TO ME OR D'YOU WANT TO GO TO THE STATION SORRY MATE IS SOMETHING WRONG 
YEAH WE'RE DOING A FOLLOW UP ON YOUR ATTACK ON WHAT 
BARTON WOODS YOU WERE FOUND UNCONSCIOUS IN THE CAR PARK 
THAT WAS YEARS AGO WE'RE LOOKING INTO AN INCIDENT THAT MAY BE RELATED WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER 
NOTHING I WAS HEADING FOR THE CAR THEN BANG 
ALL THE LIGHTS WENT OUT NEXT THING I WOKE UP IN HOSPITAL 
YOU DIDN'T SEE YOUR ATTACKER NO OTHERWISE I'D HAVE HUNTED THE BASTARD DOWN MYSELF 
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE AT THAT TIME OF NIGHT I WAS LOOKING AT A COUPLE OF PLOTS THAT WERE FOR SALE 
BUILD SOMETHING FOR ME AND THE MISSUS 
I'D STOPPED IN THE CAR PARK FOR A PISS 
ARE WE DONE COS I'VE GOT THE WARSAW MUPPET SHOW TO KEEP ON THE ROAD 
YEAH THANK YOU CHEERS O. I. TOMEK ARE YOU DEAF AS WELL AS DAFT OVER THERE 
HE'S INSTRUCTIVE AND MOTIVATIONAL I LIKE THAT IN A PERSON 
HERE OH THANKS STELLA 
DID YOU KNOW THE ARTICULATION OF THE HUMAN HAND IS MORE COMPLEX 
THAN ANYTHING COMPARABLE IN ANY OTHER ANIMAL AND WITHOUT IT 
HOMO SAPIENS WOULD HAVE TAKEN A LOT LONGER POSSIBLY THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
TO ACHIEVE THE DOMINANCE THAT THEY HAVE NO I DIDN'T KNOW 
YEAH BECAUSE WELL IT CAN MAKE A FIST OR IT CAN WAVE HELLO OR THREAD A NEEDLE EXACTLY 
OR IT CAN WIELD A KNIFE 
NOW ELEMENTAL ANALYSIS HAS SHOWN TWO DISTINCT TYPES OF METAL FRAGMENT EMBEDDED IN THIS HAND 
NOW IF YOU LOOK OVER HERE 
AT THE FIRST SET OF FRAGMENTS 
THESE ARE FROM A LOW GRADE ALLOY COMPOSITE SUCH AS YOU'D FIND IN A WATCH STRAP 
DAMAGED WHEN THE HAND WAS CHOPPED OFF YEAH 
AND CHOPPED IS THE OPERATIVE WORD BECAUSE THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF SERRATION OR HACKING 
THE HEAD AND THE HANDS WERE ALL SEVERED WITH SINGLE CUTS 
SINGLE CUTS MM SO IT'S NOT A HAND SAW OR A POWER TOOL 
NO AND YOU WOULDN'T GET THAT KIND OF LEVERAGE WITH A KNIFE NO MATTER HOW SHARP NO 
AN AXE OR A MACHETE POSSIBLY 
LOOK AT THE SECOND SET OF FRAGMENTS 
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT YEAH PROCESSED HIGHLY TEMPERED STEEL 
I'D PUT MY MONEY ON A SWORD 
AND A BIG ONE 
STEADY STEADY STEADY GOOD BOY 
STEADY 
GOOD BOY 
STEADY STEADY 
GOOD BOY 
DAMAGE TO THE NECK VERTEBRAE AND LEFT SHOULDER 
INDICATE THAT THE CUT WAS DELIVERED FROM IN FRONT AND ABOVE 
IF YOU WANT TO KNEEL DOWN STELLA AND FROM LEFT TO RIGHT 
THAT'S RIGHT TO LEFT YEAH BUT WE DO IT FROM BEHIND 
TO ACHIEVE THIS ANGLE THE VICTIM MUST HAVE BEEN ON THEIR KNEES 
THE ASSAILANT STANDING AS IS THIS RELATIONSHIP YEAH 
AN EARLY INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE SUGGESTS THAT THE VICTIM'S HEART 
WAS STILL PUMPING WHITE BLOOD CELLS TO THE BONE ENDS 
WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE HANDS THANK YOU COULD HAVE BEEN CUT OFF WHILE HE WAS STILL ALIVE 
YOU'RE ASSUMING ONE ASSAILANT THERE COULD BE TWO ONE AH BUT 
LOOKING AT SOIL SAMPLES THAT I DISCOVERED UNDER THE VICTIM'S FINGERNAILS 
AMONGST OTHER THINGS CONTAINED EGGS FROM THE HORSE PARASITE OXYURIS EQUI 
WHICH IS A WORM THAT INHABITS THE HORSE'S ANAL REGION 
THE EGGS PASS THROUGH TO THE FAECES IF I CAN BORROW YOU AGAIN STELLA YEAH SURE 
AND BACK IN YOUR POSITION O. K. 
NOW IT IS THE HORSE THAT PROVIDES THE NECESSARY VELOCITY SO GALLOPING 
YEAH IF YOU WATCH THIS 
HANDS GO UP TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND THEN THE HEAD COMES OFF ALL IN ONE BLOW 
I'VE DONE A FURTHER SEARCH OF THE AREA FOR MISSING PERSONS 
BASED ON THE VICTIM'S AGE WITHIN A TWO MILE RADIUS OF WHERE HE WAS FOUND 
THERE'S A TRAINING COLLEGE A BOARDING SCHOOL AND AN ARMY BARRACKS 
THE ROYAL MILITARY POLICE HAVE RECORDS OF A NUMBER OF SOLDIERS THAT WENT A. W. O. L. FROM GLENWOOD BARRACKS 
I'M ON IT THIS SUPPORTS YOUR THEORY OF A MILITARY STYLE EXECUTION FROM A HORSE YEAH 
THERE ARE OTHER KEY ELEMENTS TO CONSIDER THERE'S THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE PERSON WHO DISPOSED OF THE BODY 
THERE'S STILL THE MOTIVE WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO KILL THIS MAN IN SUCH AN EXTRAVAGANT WAY 
WHAT DOES HOW THE BODY IS DISPOSED OF TELL US 
WELL IT GIVES US A MIXED PROFILE OH I HATE THOSE YES I KNOW 
THEY CAN BE VERY REVEALING GO ON O. K. SO THE VICTIM WAS DECAPITATED 
AND THE BURIAL WAS RUSHED RIGHT AND THAT TELLS US I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THAT TELLS US 
I'VE JUST SPOKEN HANG ON THE PERSON WAS CAPABLE OF BEING CALM AND OF PANICKING 
SO WHAT I'VE JUST A MINUTE IT ALSO TELLS US THAT HE HAD AN ABILITY TO ORGANISE UNDER PRESSURE 
RIGHT GO ON RIGHT I'VE JUST CHECKED WITH THE BARRACKS 
THREE PEOPLE WENT ABSENT WITHOUT LEAVE TWO HAVE TURNED UP SINCE 
THE ONLY ONE THAT FITS IS FRANCIS DUGGAN WHEN DID HE GO MISSING 
APRIL TWO THOUSAND SIX O. K. THAT DOES FIT WHY DIDN'T THE ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION KNOW ABOUT HIM 
HIS FAMILY DIDN'T REPORT IT WELL HE WENT A. W. O. L. THEY KEPT IT QUIET HOW OLD IS HE 
ER TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO AT THE TIME 
AT THE TIME SO HE WAS THE RIGHT AGE RIGHT TIME RIGHT ISH PLACE 
O. K. AND I ORGANISE UNDER PRESSURE YOU KNOW DOES IT MAKE ME A KILLER 
NO IS THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION YOU DIDN'T ASK 
HERE WE GO WHAT ARE THEY DEFENDING 
HI DETECTIVE SUPERINTENDENT BOYD

IT MUST'VE BEEN HARD BRINGING HIM UP ON YOUR OWN NO NOT REALLY 
WE MAKE A GOOD TEAM GOOD AND HOW ABOUT WHEN HIS DAD WAS AT HOME 
I'VE NOT SEEN MARK FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION 
LOOK I LOVED MARK BUT HE WASN'T MUCH OF A DAD 
ESPECIALLY SINCE IRAQ 
DID HE FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO ADJUST 
IMPOSSIBLE NONE OF THEM FOUND IT EASY BUT MARK JUST THEM 
WHO DO YOU MEAN HIS FRIENDS FROM HIS TROOP 
OH SO THEY WERE VERY CLOSE 
YEAH THEY WERE MORE LIKE FAMILY 
YEAH BEFORE IRAQ OUR HOUSE WAS LIKE THE BASE OF THE BASE 
I'D COOK FOR THEM ALL BUT THEY'D MAKE ME FEEL LIKE ONE OF THE BOYS YEAH THEY WERE GOOD TIMES 
AND SINCE IRAQ IT'S BEEN HARD TO GET THE GOOD TIMES BACK 
NO MARK THOUGHT THAT 
LEAVING THE ARMY WOULD SAVE HIM BUT HE JUST WENT INTO FREEFALL 
AND BY THE END HE WAS GETTING PISSED IN THE MORNING TO KILL THE HANGOVER FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE 
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN GRIM WITH A CHILD ABOUT 
YEAH YEAH IT WAS 
SO WHAT WAS THE FINAL STRAW 
HE KEPT COMPLAINING THAT HE WAS BROKE 
AND YET I FOUND AN ENVELOPE FILLED WITH CASH IN HIS JACKET 
I DIDN'T CONFRONT HIM I JUST WAITED FOR HIM TO GO OUT AND I FOLLOWED HIM 
HI MARK WHO'S YOUR FRIEND 
SWEETHEART OH DON'T TELL ME IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

YOU'VE HAD NO CONTACT WITH HIM SINCE 
WHAT NO BIRTHDAY CARDS FOR THE BOY AT CHRISTMAS

IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING YOU DON'T SEEM TOO SAD ABOUT IT 
LIKE I SAID ME AND ROBBIE IT WORKS 
THIS WOMAN YOU SAW WITH MARK HAD YOU EVER SEEN HER BEFORE 
NO NEVER I THINK SHE WAS FOREIGN OR SOMETHING 
COULD YOU BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC 
SHE LOOKED ARAB 
AND YOU'VE NO IDEA WHERE MARK MIGHT HAVE GONE 
NO 
AND IF YOU FIND HIM TELL HIM THAT ME AND ROBBIE ARE FINE ON OUR OWN 
DO YOU THINK MARK BENNET COULD BE OUR VICTIM 
HE DISAPPEARED AT THE RIGHT TIME 
NICOLA BENNET DIDN'T SEEM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HIM THOUGH 
SHE WAS MORE WORRIED ABOUT LEAVING THE BOY WITH YOU REALLY HE DIDN'T SAY MUCH 
BUT I DID GET HIM TO DRINK EXCELLENT 
LET'S GET IT TO EVE SEE WHAT IT CAN GIVE US 
THIS IS JUST UNBELIEVABLE I'M A POLICE OFFICER 
DETECTIVE SUPERINTENDENT BOYD SUPERINTENDENT BOYD 
COLONEL MALHAM YEAH I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS IF I MAY 
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE TOO LATE THE ROYAL MILITARY POLICE HAVE INITIATED THEIR OWN INQUIRY 
GOOD I'M PLEASED FOR THEM BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE HAVE A LOCKDOWN IN PLACE 
UNTIL THE R. M. P. HAVE CONCLUDED THEIR BUSINESS 
A LOCKDOWN TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT THAT'S A NOVEL IDEA 
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE LESS THAN RIGOROUS NO NOT AT ALL 
THE SENIOR OFFICER WHO'S CONDUCTING THIS INQUIRY WHAT'S HIS NAME 
HIS NAME YEAH WHAT'S HE CALLED 
WHAT DOES HE ANSWER TO WHEN HE'S SHOUTED AT I CAN'T TALK TO YOU 
NO OF COURSE THE LOCKDOWN 
THE HUGUENOTS WHEN THEY WERE UNDER SIEGE 
THEY ATE WHATEVER THEY COULD GET THEIR HANDS ON RATS LEATHER HUMAN FLESH 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE ROYALISTS DID NO IDEA 
THEY WAITED 
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YOUR SON WAS WITH FRANCIS DUGGAN WHEN THEY WERE ATTACKED LOMAX 
MY SON WAS KILLED WHILST SERVING HIS COUNTRY 
GOOD DAY TO YOU SUPERINTENDENT 
GOOD DAY TO YOU 
YOU TWO WERE GREAT THANKS VERY HELPFUL INDEED 
WHAT THE BLOODY HELL ARE YOU PLAYING AT LOMAX 
SIR THE BRASSES ARE DIRTY THE BLACKING'S A DISGRACE 
IF THESE MEN WERE TO PARADE LIKE THIS THEY'D BE A LAUGHING STOCK 
RESPONSIBILITY COMMITMENT LEADERSHIP 
THAT'S WHAT'S REQUIRED OF YOU LOMAX DO YOU REMEMBER 
I WANT YOU TO APOLOGISE FOR FAILING THEM 
SIR NOT TO ME TO THEM 
THE WINNER OF THIS YEAR'S CHURCHILL CUP FOR BEST TURNED OUT RECRUIT GOES TO TROOPER LOMAX 
THANK YOU SIR WELL DONE LOMAX 
THERE'S NO WAY I SHOULD'VE COME FOURTH ALL RIGHT ROB 
DUGGAN RECKONS YOU DIDN'T DESERVE TO COME FIRST I DIDN'T SAY THAT 
ATTENTION I JUST WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT IT'S OFFICIAL 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE BEST OF THE BEST THE HARDCORE CREW 
YEAH 
IRAQ HERE WE COME 
THIS IS A METAL FRAGMENT I FOUND IN THE VICTIM'S HAND 
THE SWORD MAKER'S METALLURGY TESTS CONFIRM IT'S FROM A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEAR OLD BLADE 
HOW MANY OF THOSE WERE IN THE ARMOURY 
OF THE SWORDS I TESTED IN THE ARMOURY NONE OF THEM YIELDED ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE 
NOW AS YOU'D EXPECT TO SEE FROM A MURDER WEAPON I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN 
IT'S BEEN RESHAPED AND RE SHARPENED SO I TOOK SOME METAL FRAGMENTS FROM THIS SWORD 
AND IT TESTED POSITIVE TO BEING A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEAR OLD BLADE 
IS THIS OUR MURDER WEAPON NO 
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT'S THE SAME AGE IT'S BEEN RESHAPED AND RE SHARPENED 
THE METAL FRAGMENTS IN THIS SWORD ARE MARKEDLY DIFFERENT TO THE ONES IN THE HAND 
AS YOU CAN SEE THERE SO HOW DOES THIS HELP US 
BECAUSE EACH SWORD IS UNIQUE IN ITS METALLURGICAL COMPOSITION THIS IS FANTASTIC 
BUT MALHAM WOULD'VE GOT RID OF THE SWORD NO 
BECAUSE IF IT WAS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS OLD ITS HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE ALSO IF YOU GO SOME WAY TOWARDS 
MATCHING UP THE FRAGMENTS YOU GO SOME WAY TOWARDS IDENTIFYING THE KILLER 
BUT HE'S INITIATED A LOCKDOWN SO WHATEVER SWORD HE USES 
WE CAN'T GET IN TO THE BARRACKS SO IT COULD BE ANYWHERE BY NOW 
THAT REALLY WAS 
INTERESTING BUT NOT REMOTELY HELPFUL RIGHT THANK YOU TOO I DO WHAT I CAN 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT I'VE TRACKED DOWN ONE OF THE TROOPERS FROM THE LAND ROVER UNIT ANDY TYRREL

MARK WAS A GOOD LAD YOU KNOW BUT HE LIKED THE DRINK 
WE LOST TOUCH 
AND FRAN DUGGAN SHOULD'VE BEEN GIVEN A MEDICAL DISCHARGE 
EVERYONE KNEW HE'D EVENTUALLY DO A RUNNER 
ROB LOMAX STAYED IN THE REGIMENT 
HOW COME 
YOU KNOW A LOT OF LADS SIGN UP COS OF ALL THE CEREMONY AND TRADITION 
BUT HE STILL BUYS INTO ALL THAT HONOUR AND DUTY CRAP 
THAT THE REGIMENT FEEDS YOU 
HE'LL NEVER LEAVE AND THE GUY THAT WAS KILLED IN IRAQ JAMES MALHAM WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT HIM 
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN OUT THERE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE 
ORDERED US INTO A NO GO ZONE NEARLY GOT US ALL KILLED 
DUGGAN WOULD'VE DIED AS WELL IF LOMAX HADN'T GOT TO HIM 
HOW WAS DUGGAN AFFECTED BY THAT 
FRAN WAS THE YOUNGEST IN THE REGIMENT YOU KNOW 
HE WAS JUST A KID HIS HEAD WENT AFTER WE GOT HIT 
DO YOU KEEP IN TOUCH WITH HIM 
THE WHOLE PLACE WAS JUST A SICK JOKE IN TOTAL MELTDOWN 
SECOND LIEUTENANT MALHAM WAS A YOUNG OFFICER ON HIS FIRST DEPLOYMENT 
HE WAS CAUGHT UP IN THE MOMENT A CHASE AFTER SUSPECTED INSURGENTS IT'S EASY TO MAKE A MISTAKE 
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION OF HIS FATHER 
COL MALHAM DEVOTES EVERY SECOND TO THE REGIMENT HE'S DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB 
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE ASKING YOU 
THE SOLDIERS IN THE LAND ROVER TESTIFIED THAT HIS SON IGNORED ORDERS AND GOT HIMSELF KILLED 
HOW DID COLONEL MALHAM FEEL ABOUT THAT 
LOSING HIS SON WAS DEVASTATING HIS MARRIAGE ENDED SOON AFTER NOW ALL HE HAS IS THE REGIMENT 
BUT YOU TURNED YOUR BACK ON ALL THAT YES THE BRITISH ARMY MOVES VERY SLOWLY 
IT'S ALSO UNDER FUNDED AND POORLY PREPARED FOR ALL THE TASKS IT'S ASKED TO CARRY OUT 
SO YOU SET UP A. P. X. SOLUTIONS TO SHOW THEM HOW IT'S DONE YEAH 
AND THANKS TO YOU WE DON'T SEE AS MANY BRITISH SOLDIERS BEING KILLED 
BECAUSE YOU KEEP THE OFFICIAL BODY COUNT DOWN THE POLITICIANS DON'T GET AS MUCH FLAK 
I MEAN YOU ALMOST TURN WAR INTO A DECENT EVENT 
WELL THE ENTIRE SECURITY SITUATION WORLDWIDE HAS CHANGED 
IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE YOU NEED HIGHLY TRAINED PROFESSIONALS AND YOU PICK THE BEST 
YES I CERTAINLY DO 
SO WITH TWO PARENTS AND THE BOY'S D. N. A. I COULD BE NINE NINE NINE NINE NINE BASICALLY A LOT OF NINES PER CENT CERTAIN 
DOES ROBBIE BENNET'S D. N. A. GIVE US A MATCH TO THE BLOB OR NOT 
IT STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT THE DEAD BODY IS MARK BENNET 
HI MARK WHO'S YOUR FRIEND 
SO WE HAVE OUR VICTIM PROBABLY I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN EXACT SCIENCE 
IT IS AN EXACT SCIENCE JUST GO THROUGH THE CONNECTIONS THEN 
HE WAS A GUARDSMAN AS WAS FRANCIS DUGGAN 
DUGGAN AND BENNET WERE BOTH IN THE LAND ROVER ON THE DAY COLONEL MALHAM'S SON WAS KILLED 
THEY BOTH TESTIFIED AT THE INQUIRY DUGGAN WENT MISSING ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS BENNET DISAPPEARED 
SO DUGGAN COULD BE ANOTHER VICTIM OR THE KILLER 
NICOLA BENNET TOLD YOU THAT THE DAY THAT HER HUSBAND DISAPPEARED HE WAS WITH A FOREIGN WOMAN ARAB 
SHE LOOKED ARAB AN ARAB YEAH 
SO WHERE WERE THEY IN THE SHOPPING PRECINCT 
BYE BYE 
SO THIS IS WHERE NICOLA BENNET SAID SHE SAW THEM 
I'M SKINT TRYING TO FEED YOUR SON AND YOU'RE SWANNING AROUND WITH SOME SLAG 
NOT AN OBVIOUS PLACE FOR A DATE C. C. T. V. 
TWO YEARS ON YOU'LL BE LUCKY 
I FOUND THESE FIBRES UNDER THE FINGERNAILS OF MARK BENNET'S HAND 
THE CORTEX HAS SPINDLE SHAPED CELLS AND YOU'LL SEE THE MULTISERRATE LADDERS IN ITS MEDULLA 
SO SHEEP HAIR WOOL 
RIGHT AND IT'S COLOURED WITH SCARLET ACID MILLING DYE 
SO WHERE DO THEY COME FROM THESE BITS OF STUFF 
FROM THE MESS KIT OF THE GUARDS REGIMENT 
IT'S MADE OF DOESKIN WHICH IS A TYPE OF WOOLLEN WEAVE 
I GOT IN TOUCH WITH THE MOD FABRIC SUPPLIER 
SAME DYE SAME FIBRES 
SO THEY'D HAVE HAD TO WEAR THIS ER OUTFIT TO THE REGIMENTAL DINNER MM 
THE NIGHT MARK BENNET DISAPPEARED THIS IS THE LAST REPORTED SIGHTING BY HIS WIFE NICOLA 
THAT'S GOT TO HURT CHARMING 
CAN YOU JUST ZOOM IN ON THAT OTHER WOMAN PLEASE SPENCE 
NICOLA BENNET MENTIONED A FOREIGN LOOKING WOMAN WHO WAS WITH THEM 
FOREIGN LOOKING SHE LOOKS FOREIGN TO YOU DOES SHE 
YOU SPEND YOUR LIFE LOOKING AT C. C. T. V. AND IT'S ALL THE SAME ISN'T IT 
SO BENNET HITS NICOLA 
THE TIME CODE READS TWENTY FIFTH MARCH TWO THOUSAND SIX AT NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN WHICH IS THE SAME NIGHT AS THE REGIMENTAL DINNER 
WHICH WAS TWO HOURS LATER SO BENNET SLAPS HIS WIFE AND THEN GOES STRAIGHT TO THE BARRACKS 
WHERE HE CAME INTO CONTACT WITH ONE OF OUR SOLDIERS I'VE GOT TO TALK TO MALHAM 
WE CAN'T GET ACCESS MOD SAID ALL REQUESTS HAVE TO BE MADE IN WRITING WHICH I'VE DONE BUT 
O. K. O. K. 
YOU COMMANDED THESE MEN IN A WAR ZONE 
YOU HANDED COMMAND OVER TO MALHAM IT'S HARDLY SURPRISING HE'S STONEWALLING 
YOU'RE INVESTIGATING ONE OF HIS TROOPERS FOR MURDER WHAT IS THIS A SECRET SOCIETY 
YOU'RE PART OF THE OLD BOYS' NETWORK YOU AND MALHAM ARE MADE OF THE SAME STUFF 
HE'LL LISTEN TO YOU YOU'RE EXAGGERATING MY INFLUENCE IT'S A LOT MORE THAN I HAVE 
SIR COLONEL MALHAM'S IN HIS OFFICE THANK YOU 
IF I CAN HAVE A MOMENT ALONE I MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONVINCE HIM TO CO OPERATE RIGHT 
AND HOPEFULLY THE POLICE CAN GET WHAT THEY WANT 
I KNOW IT'S A BUGGER AT THIS TIME OF YEAR DOUGLAS ALL RIGHT COLONEL 
WOULD YOU MIND IF I SAID HELLO TO A FEW OF THE OLD FACES NO NO OF COURSE BE MY GUEST 
COME IN I'LL DO THIS ALONE ALL RIGHT O. K. 
DO YOU MIND IF I JOIN YOU 
NOT AT ALL NO 
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT YOUR SON 
MY SON HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR INVESTIGATION 
BECAUSE TELLING ME ABOUT HIM MEANT TELLING ME ABOUT HIS MISTAKE 
NO NO NO NO NO THEN WHAT ENLIGHTEN ME PLEASE 
I'M DAMNED IF I DO AND DAMNED IF I DON'T 
BUT SILENCE AND DENIAL ARE NOT 
THEY'RE NOT MUCH OF A REFUGE ARE THEY 
SUPERINTENDENT THE INQUIRY WAS A WHITEWASH 
WHAT IF THERE'S A CONNECTION BETWEEN IRAQ AND MARK BENNET'S MURDER 
HOW COULD THERE BE 
THE MEN IN YOUR SON'S TROOP WHEN THEY CAME HOME THEY WERE PLACED UNDER YOUR COMMAND 
YES BECAUSE I WAS PLACED IN CHARGE OF CEREMONIAL DUTIES 
SO WHEN THEY WERE GIVING EVIDENCE AT THE INQUIRY IT MUST HAVE BEEN UNBELIEVABLY DIFFICULT 
THIS IS JUST PART OF ER 
MARK BENNET'S STATEMENT AT THE INQUIRY 
HE SAYS 
SECOND LIEUTENANT MALHAM REPEATEDLY IGNORED THE NO GO ZONE AND OUR WARNINGS 
NOW BENNET IS DEAD AND ONE OF THE OTHER WITNESSES FRANCIS DUGGAN HAS GONE MISSING 
AND THEN THERE'S ROB LOMAX WHO SAVED DUGGAN'S LIFE BUT NOT YOUR SON'S HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL 
DO YOU HAVE A SON SUPERINTENDENT H. M. M. 
WHY DO YOU ASK 
I EXPECTED TO SEE JAMES COMMAND THE REGIMENT TO TAKE THE QUEEN'S SALUTE 
INSTEAD I COULD HAVE BURIED HIM IN A SHOE BOX THERE WAS SO LITTLE LEFT OF HIM 
AND NOT DEFENDING YOUR SON 
MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE A BAD FATHER 
BUT IGNORING THE INQUIRY'S FINDINGS MAKES YOU A VERY BAD SOLDIER 
MY SON WAS A HERO I DON'T NEED TO JUSTIFY HIS ACTIONS TO YOU 
WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE 
JUPITER WAS MY HORSE 
WONDERFUL TEMPERAMENT YOU MUST MISS THIS 
THERE'S SOME ASPECTS BUT YOU MOVE BEYOND WHERE YOU WERE 
TIME TO MOVE ON 
I SENSE THAT WITH YOU INSPECTOR 
REALLY YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR POTENTIAL IN CHECK BECAUSE OF WHERE YOU ARE 
PERHAPS IF YOU EVER THINK ABOUT LEAVING THE POLICE FORCE YOU SHOULD GIVE ME A CALL 
I HAD TO MAKE A CHOICE 
I COULD REACH DUGGAN WHEN I TRIED TO GO BACK FOR MALHAM THE PETROL TANK WENT UP 
PLEASE ROB PLEASE LOMAX 
I'LL COME BACK FOR YOU SIR PLEASE 
LOMAX 
LOMAX 
THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO 
I DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT JAMES MALHAM BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT DAY 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE STILL HERE WHY WELL 
HERE YOU'RE CONFRONTED BY THE FATHER ALL THE TIME AND HE'S OBVIOUSLY DEVASTATED 
THIS REGIMENT'S MY HOME 
NOW THE NIGHT THAT MARK BENNET DISAPPEARED HE VISITED THE BARRACKS WAS THAT TO SEE YOU NO 
AND HE WAS LAST SEEN WITH A MIDDLE EASTERN WOMAN DO YOU KNOW HER NO 
THAT'S MY SON TWO YEARS OLD GONNA BE A STAR 
WE CALL HIM ROBBIE 
AFTER HIS GODFATHER HERE 
I'M NOT HAVING MUCH LUCK HERE AM I 
AND WHAT ABOUT FRANCIS DUGGAN 
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE HE WENT A. W. O. L. 
SOME OF THESE KIDS ARE JUST EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE 
HOW DO YOU COME TO TERMS WITH SENDING THEM OUT TO GET KILLED 
DO YOU JUST MARK THEM DOWN AS ACCEPTABLE LOSSES 
I TOOK YOUNG SOLDIERS OUT TO IRAQ AND WAS THEN TOLD TO MAKE THEM ACT AS POLICEMEN IT WAS A BLOODY CRIME 
THE FACE OF EVERY YOUNG BOY I LOST IS BURNED INTO MY MEMORY SO NO 
NO SOLDIER'S DEATH IS ACCEPTABLE TO ME 
LUKE 
LUKE 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO ME O. K. 
I DIDN'T MEAN FOR ANY OF THAT TO HAPPEN 
I WENT THERE 
WELL I WENT THERE TO TELL YOU THAT I'M HERE IF YOU NEED HELP 
AND THAT I'M SORRY SON 
O. K. 
O. K. 
O. K. 
YOU SURE IT WAS HER 
THE GUYS WHO HANDLE IMMIGRATION CLAIMS TIPPED US OFF 
SHE'S RE ENTERED THE COUNTRY 
I THOUGHT ALL THIS WAS SORTED AYE WELL IT'S NOT 
SHE STARTS ON DUGGAN 
YOU'VE NO IDEA WHERE HE COULD BE I TOLD YOU I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM 
REMEMBER MICKEY FORRESTER THE RADIO OPERATOR 
HE RECKONS HE SAW DUGGAN ROUND THE PRECINCT OH MICKEY 
HERE YOU ARE SON 
O. K. BE LUCKY 
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NO 
WE ARE GOING TO FIND HIM BEFORE SHAHLA OR THE POLICE DO 
RIGHT 
HEY FRAN YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER AND GET AS FAR AWAY FROM HERE AS YOU CAN 
WHAT IS THIS TOO PUBLIC FOR YOU YOU THINK IF I WANTED TO HARM YOU I'D WASTE TIME TALKING 
YEAH WELL I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU WE'RE STILL A TEAM WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY 
LISTEN HERE 
I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY YOU NEED IT THE POLICE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU EVERYONE'S SHITTING THEMSELVES 
LOOK HERE NOTES RUSTLE 
WHY SHAHLA'S BACK SHE WANTS ANSWERS NOW GO 
IT'S O. K. ISMA 
IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MEANS MOTIVE AND OPPORTUNITY 
DUGGAN LOMAX AND TYRREL HAVE GOT THE MEANS 
THEY'RE TRAINED TO KILL THEY ALSO ALL HAD THE OPPORTUNITY COS THEY WERE ALL AT THE REGIMENTAL DINNER 
AS WAS COLONEL MALHAM YEAH FOR MOTIVE I GUESS THIS GUY GRACE IS AT THE TOP OF YOUR LIST 
YES BENNET DENOUNCING HIS SON WOULD'VE BEEN VERY PROVOCATIVE 
BUT ISN'T LOMAX A MORE LIKELY TARGET FOR MALHAM HE SAVED DUGGAN OVER HIS SON DIDN'T HE 
NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE IT'S THE FLASHPOINT 
BENNET'S INSULTS WOULD HAVE IGNITED THE WHOLE TRAUMA OF MALHAM LOSING HIS SON 
SO IT'S THE WORDS THAT DID IT 
LOOKING INTO DUGGAN'S BACKGROUND SOMETHING STRANGE TURNED UP 
AN ACTIVE BANK ACCOUNT IN THE NAME OF SUSAN CARLYLE 
WHO'S SHE DUGGAN'S SISTER CARLYLE IS THEIR LATE MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME 
SHE CHANGED HER NAME WHEN SHE LEFT HOME SHE'S IN A CANCER HOSPICE 
ONE BIG HAPPY BUNCH THESE DUGGANS AREN'T THEY 
HELLO FRANCIS SHAHLA YOU HAVE TO HELP ME 
LOOK THIS ISN'T A GOOD TIME O. K. I'M LATE I'VE JUST 
I'VE COME FROM HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD AND YOU ARE LATE I'M SORRY 
I CAN'T FIND MARK AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I TRUST 
I CAN'T HELP YOU 
I'VE GOT MY OWN PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW SHAHLA YOU'RE NOT A COWARD 
FRANCIS I KNOW YOU'RE NOT A COWARD O. K. DON'T DO ANYTHING SILLY AND I'LL MEET YOU HERE IN TWO HOURS 
HOW STUPID DO YOU THINK I AM WELL YOU'RE SAYING YOU TRUST ME 
YOU GIVE ME YOUR WORD YES SAY IT 
SHAHLA I GIVE YOU MY WORD O. K. 
DON'T MOVE

I MIGHT NEED TO GO AWAY FOR A BIT 
HOW LONG I DUNNO

MARK BENNET AND FRANCIS DUGGAN SERVED WITH YOU IN IRAQ 
WHO MIGHT HAVE WANTED THEM DEAD 
I DON'T KNOW 
WHO OR WHAT IS WORTH MORE THAN THE LIVES OF TWO SOLDIERS 
I CAN'T HELP YOU I KNOW ABOUT THE MONEY FROM ROB LOMAX 
DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR LITTLE BOY 
SOCIAL SERVICES WILL TAKE CARE OF HIM WHAT 
I DON'T NEED A SHOULDER TO CRY ON I WAS THINKING OF A FRIENDLY CHAT 
OR A CONFESSION 
WHAT WAS YOUR OPINION ON COL MALHAM HIS SON'S DEATH HIT HIM VERY HARD 
WELL HE'S FEEDING OFF HIS ANGER AND HIS GRIEF 
I THINK HE'S SUFFERING FROM SURVIVOR'S GUILT 
THAT WOULD GIVE HIM A PROPENSITY TO SUICIDE THAT'S FANTASTIC 
WHAT DID YOU DO TO MARK 
EVERYONE'S GONE IT'S JUST ME NOW YOU'RE SCARING ME 
IT'S LOMAX I SHOULD BE SPEAKING TO I SUPPOSE SO 
A MAN YOU HATE I'VE TOLD YOU WHAT HAPPENED 
GET HIM OUT HE'S A DISGRACE COS YOU CAN'T THINK FOR YOURSELF 
CAN YOU LOMAX YOU WERE THERE YOU CAN SPEAK OUT I'LL DO ALL I CAN
