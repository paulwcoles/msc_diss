ODD BANDS HERE AND THERE RIGHT 
LOVELY AND FAMOUSLY I DID SELL MYSELF ON EBAY AT EASTER THIS YEAR 
HOW MUCH DID YOU GET I WENT FOR SIXTY SIX QUID 
ALL PROFITS WENT TO CANCER RESEARCH 
YES IT WAS KIND OF A FUN ITEM 
IT WAS REALLY AIMED FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE INTERESTED IN SPIRITUALITY BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO GO TO CHURCH 
SO WE AUCTIONED OFF A CUP OF TEA AND AN HOUR'S SPIRITUAL DIRECTION WITH A VICAR 
SO THEY DON'T GET YOU FOR THE WEEKEND THEN NO JUST AN HOUR 
YOU'D HAVE TO PAY A LOT MORE THAN THAT FOR THE WEEKEND 
THERE'S A MAN WHO KNOWS THE VALUE OF HIMSELF WHICH IS A CHANGE 
SO MARTIN WHAT DID YOU BID FOR HIM THEN 
WELL I DID BID FOR HIM BUT I HAD TO STOP AT MY ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM WHICH WAS FIFTY P. 
THERE'S A REAL FRIEND 
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING MARTIN I RUN A DESIGN AND ADVERTISING COMPANY 
WE WORK PREDOMINANTLY WITH CHILDREN'S BRANDS SUCH AS BOB THE BUILDER AND TELETUBBIES 
I ACTUALLY WENT TO TELETUBBYLAND A COUPLE OF TIMES 
IT WAS QUITE A STRANGE EXPERIENCE 
WHAT DO YOU DO IN YOUR SPARE TIME 
I'M IN A BAND AS WELL WHICH IS CALLED DON'T ASK 
MY PRIDE AND JOY IS A GIBSON LES PAUL GUITAR WHICH I PLAY IN THE BAND 
AND WHAT IT'S WORTH THAT GUITAR ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED

SO WILL IT BE THE RED ADVENTURERS OR THE BLUE SINGERS WHO RAKE IN THE PROFITS TODAY 
BLUSHING FOR THE REDS IS THE DELICIOUS DAVID BARBY 
PICKING IT UP FOR THE BLUES IS THE CAPABLE CATHERINE SOUTHON 
HEY JANE WHAT DO YOU THINK LOOK AT THAT 
ISN'T IT NICE NOT KEEN 
I HEARD THAT YOU DON'T LIKE IT 
NOT PARTICULARLY 
I'M NOT CERTAIN EITHER 
ROBERTA TELL ME WHY YOU LIKE IT 
I REALLY REALLY LIKE THIS I THINK IT'S SIMPLE 
IT COULD GO INTO A MINIMALIST HOUSE I THINK 
IT WOULD BE PERHAPS NICE IN A CLOAKROOM SOMETHING JUST SIMPLE 
IF YOU WANTED TO MOVE IT YOU COULD FOLD IT AND CARRY IT WITH YOU 
YOU ARE KICKING AGAINST THE TREND 
BECAUSE MAHOGANY FURNITURE BROWN FURNITURE IS NOT SELLING AT AUCTION THIS IS BROWN FURNITURE 
BUT THERE JUST MIGHT BE 
IT'S SIMPLE IT'S UNUSUAL IT'S UNUSUAL 
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE 
IT'S GOT AN ELEMENT OF QUIRKINESS 
THEY'RE CALLING THIS A CAMPAIGN MIRROR 
THE WHOLE THING CAN BE FOLDED UP AND MOVED FROM ONE PARTICULAR CAMPAIGN TO ANOTHER 
OFTEN ONE SECTION OF THE HOUSE TO ANOTHER WHAT SORT OF DATE IS IT DAVID 
THE DEALER HAS PUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY TO SEVENTY 
I THINK IT'S SLIGHTLY LATER THAN THAT 
WHAT ABOUT THE DAMAGE THOUGH 
IT IS A BIT SCUFFED ISN'T IT 
IT IS WHAT IS TERMED AS DISTRESSED 
YES BUT I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN USED AND IT'S GOT TOUCHES OF THE PEOPLE WHO USED IT AND LOOKED IN IT 
DOES THAT NOT WORRY YOU THAT SOMEONE'S GOT TO BUY THIS AND THEN RESTORE IT POSSIBLY 
BUT THEY MIGHT JUST LIKE IT AS IT IS FOR SIMILAR REASONS THAT I LIKE IT 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN AROUND IT'S TRAVELLED 
I'VE TRAVELLED A LOT MAYBE THAT'S WHAT SPEAKS TO ME ABOUT IT JANE 
LET'S HAVE YOUR VIEW ON THIS BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGE WOULD ANYBODY BUY THIS 
WOULD WE MAKE ANY MONEY ON IT 
THIS IS IT JANE WELL OBSERVED 
THE PRICE EIGHTY FIVE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE A PROFIT AT EIGHTY FIVE 
YOU NEED TO NEGOTIATE PROBABLY AROUND ABOUT FIFTY TO SIXTY TO MAKE A PROFIT 
THEN I CAN SEE IT GOING AT AUCTION AT EIGHTY TO NINETY IT'S UP TO YOU 
O. K. BEST OF LUCK NEGOTIATE 
AND BEG THEY DID AND GOT THE MIRROR FOR SIXTY FIVE QUID 
CATHERINE CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING 
YES WHAT HAVE YOU GOT HERE A LITTLE TEA CADDY THAT'S RATHER NICE 
YES I LIKE IT WHY WERE YOU DRAWN TOWARDS THIS 
WELL THE PRICE ACTUALLY 
YOU'RE NOT AN ACCOUNTANT ARE YOU 
NO I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT IS QUITE SIMPLE A LOT OF THEM ARE QUITE FUSSY 
IT IS A VERY SIMPLE ONE 
A NICE IVORY ESCUTCHEON 
BUN FEET LET'S HAVE A LOOK INSIDE 
WE'VE GOT THE LEAD LININGS WHICH IS GREAT 
WE HAVEN'T GOT THE LIDS WITH THE LITTLE FINIALS ON BUT THAT'S FINE 
WE'VE GOT THE LEAD LINING THIS LINING INSIDE IS THIS THE ORIGINAL 
IT LOOKS LIKE MY LOCAL INDIAN RESTAURANT 
PROBABLY IS ACTUALLY 
WHAT IS THE MAGIC PRICE THEN 
THIRTY EIGHT 
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD ACTUALLY 
YES IF YOU CAN GET IT A BIT LOWER EVEN BETTER 
BUT THAT SHOULD MAKE A BIT OF A PROFIT FOR US DO YOU LIKE IT JOE 
IT'S A BIT SMALL FOR MY LIKING BUT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO TO GO FOR IT 
MARTIN YOU LIKE IT DON'T YOU I DO IT'S YOUR PIECE 
SO ON YOUR HEAD BE IT O. K. 
THEY MANAGED TO KNOCK ANOTHER FIVER OFF AND GOT IT FOR THIRTY THREE 
YOU'RE ON T. V. IT'S ME IN THE FLESH AND BLOOD 
HI I'M VICKY I WATCH YOU ON T. V. EVERY DAY 
I HAVE LEARNED EVERYTHING OFF YOU 
YOU TOO CAN LEARN FROM THE MASTER 
JUST CLICK ON TO BBCCO.UK SLASH LIFESTYLE 
ROBERTA DAVID COME AND HAVE A LOOK AT THIS 
OH WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE 
WHATEVER IT IS IT'S VERY HEAVY BUT I THINK IT'S A JARDINIERE 
I THINK IT'S QUITE STUNNING 
I THINK THAT'S SUPERB WHAT'S IT MADE OF 
I WOULD LIKE TO THINK IT'S MADE OF BRONZE BUT I'M NOT SURE 
CAN I JUST JUMP IN FRONT OF YOU AND FEEL IT 
OH IT IS HEAVY ISN'T IT 
IT IS BRONZE DID YOU NOTICE THERE'S NO LINER 
YES I DID 
SO THERE'S NO BASE TO IT 
I THINK THIS WOULD HAVE HAD A SEPARATE LINER 
MAYBE A ZINC ONE WHICH HAS GONE O. K. 
OR IT MAY HAVE STOOD ON A STAND AS A CACHEPOT 
SO THE WATER WOULD DRAIN COMPLETELY OUT 
SO THE LINER WOULD HAVE BEEN A TERRACOTTA PLANT POT WHICH YOU WOULD HAVE PUT IN THERE THE DATE OF IT 
WELL I THINK IT'S MID TO LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
WHAT I LIKE IS THE DETAIL 
LOOK AT THIS WONDERFUL IMPERIAL DRAGON CAN YOU SEE IT 
OH GOSH ISN'T THAT SUPERB ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL 
AND THE ACTUAL STAND AND SUPPORTS ARE THE CLAWS OF THE DRAGONS 
HOW INVENTIVE 
THAT IS REALLY GOOD 
AND IN THIS SECTION HERE IT'S THE TAIL OF THE DRAGON WHICH IS THE OPPOSING SUPPORT VERY NICE 
AND THE OTHER THING I LIKE ABOUT IT LOOK THIS SWIRL OF CLOUDS 
AND JUST A GLIMPSE OF THE DRAGON AS IT GOES THROUGH THE CLOUDS 
MYSTIC ABSOLUTELY 
IT REALLY IS A LOVELY LOVELY PIECE 
THIS IS BRONZE IT HASN'T BEEN POLISHED THANK GOODNESS 
SO IT HAS ALL THESE LOVELY PATINATIONS ON IT 
AND YOU HAVE GOT GLIMPSES OF RED COMING THROUGH 
SO YOU'RE GRADUALLY BUILDING UP THIS LOVELY PATINATION 
THAT WOULD INDICATE ITS AGE 
IF YOU LOOK INSIDE CAN YOU SEE IT'S GREEN INSIDE 
SO THAT WILL ALSO BE INDICATIVE OF ITS AGE 
YOU CAN ONLY HAVE THAT SORT OF VERDIGRIS THROUGH AGEING 
IT'S PART AND PARCEL OF THE PATINATION 
ORIGIN CHINESE PROBABLY PRODUCED BEIJING THAT'S PEKING 
AND IT IS A VERY STRIKING PIECE 
JANE WHAT'S THE PRICE 
WELL THEY'RE ASKING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
TO MY WAY OF THINKING THAT SOUNDS A SENSIBLE PRICE 
ARE WE GOING TO MAKE MONEY ON IT 
I THINK WE'VE GOT TO NEGOTIATE TO GET IT TO A MORE REASONABLE LEVEL 
WHEN IT GOES UP FOR AUCTION WE'VE GOT TO MAKE A PROFIT 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE A PROFIT 
AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY I THINK WE STAND A CHANCE 
RIGHT IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
GOOD CHOICE JANE ACTUALLY CAN I PUT IT DOWN 
IT'S SO UNBELIEVABLY HEAVY 
BUT ABOVE ALL IT'S GOT QUALITY 
YOUR TURN TO NEGOTIATE JANE O. K. 
BEST OF LUCK O. K. 
A BIT HOT AT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SMACKERS EVEN WITH TWENTY OF THEM KNOCKED OFF 
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND A LITTLE MINIATURE SET OF BALLS 
THAT IS EXCELLENT ISN'T IT DINKY 
PERHAPS IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A PRESENTATION PIECE FORGET THE BOX 
IT'S NOT THE RIGHT BOX NO TOTALLY WRONG BOX BUT I REALLY LIKE THIS 
I'VE GOT A GOOD FEELING ABOUT IT WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I LIKE IT I THINK IT'S BRILLIANT 
JOE LOVES IT BUT YOU'RE HESITANT I THINK THEY'RE A LITTLE SMALL 
COME ON SIZE ISN'T EVERYTHING YOU KNOW THAT 
THAT'S TRUE I KNOW THEY'RE SMALL BUT LOOK AT THE QUALITY 
THEY ARE BEAUTIFULLY MADE 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT EXACT AGE IT'S DIFFICULT TO TELL WITH THESE 
BUT LOOK AT THE LITTLE IVORY INSERTS AND THE NUMBERS 
AND WE'VE GOT THE LITTLE JACK THERE 
ISN'T IT DINKY I THINK IT'S REALLY SWEET 
FORGET THE CASE IT'S NOT ORIGINAL 
BUT THESE ARE REALLY LOVELY LITTLE THINGS 
IS THERE ANY DAMAGE AT ALL 
OOH HE'S VERY PICKY THIS ONE 
LISTEN TO HIM LOOK THE EXPERT LIKES IT 
LET'S EXAMINE THESE PIECES 
THEY DO SEEM TO BE IN GOOD ORDER ACTUALLY IS THIS IVORY 
I THINK IT PROBABLY IS THERE'S NO REASON WHY IT SHOULDN'T BE WOULD YOU GO FOR THIS 
THE FACT THEY'RE NOT IN A PROPER BOX DOES THAT REALLY MATTER 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO HAVE THE ORIGINAL CASE BUT THE PRICE WOULD HAVE BEEN BUMPED UP A BIT MORE 
BUT I THINK SOMEBODY'S GOING TO GO FOR THAT ANYWAY DON'T YOU 
HE'S A BIT HESITANT HE IS THE EXPERT'S SAYING SHE'S GOT A GOOD FEELING 
I LIKE IT 
I COULD BE TOTALLY WRONG HERE BUT I COULD SEE THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING WITH THESE 
DO YOU THINK THEY'LL GO AT AUCTION THE PRICE IS FORTY 
SO I'LL SEE IF I CAN GET IT FOR A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN THAT 
AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN BOWL THEM OVER AT THE AUCTION 
CANNY CATHERINE GETS ANOTHER TEN QUID KNOCKED OFF AND BAGS THE BOWLS FOR THIRTY 
WHAT DO YOU DO ON A BAKING HOT DAY LIKE THIS WITH ALL THESE FLIES KNOCKING ABOUT 
ALL TRYING TO GET AT YOUR FOOD 
WHAT YOU NEED IS ONE OF THESE JOKERS CHARMING ISN'T IT 
IT'S MADE OF METAL NETTING GAUZE 
IT'S BEEN EMBROIDERED UNUSUALLY WITH RAFFIA WHICH IS A TYPE OF STAINED STRAW AND WOOL 
WHAT I LOVE IS THIS FLIGHT OF BEES BUZZING ABOUT AND WACKILY ENOUGH 
IT'S BEEN INTERPOSED WITH THESE PEONIES CHARMING ISN'T IT 
PROBABLY ITALIAN OR FRENCH DATING FROM MAYBE THE NINETEEN TWENTIES 
THAT'S GREAT IF YOU'VE GOT ONE DISH BUT TRY THIS ON FOR SIZE 
THIS LOT COME IN A SET OF FOUR ISN'T THAT EXTRAORDINARY 
SO YOU CAN HAVE FOUR PLATES OF DELICIOUS SANDWICHES IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR TABLE 
AND NO WRETCHED FLY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET AT THEM 
SO HOW MUCH FOR THE LOT 
FIVE THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL A BARGAIN 
AND IT'S THE NET PRICE 
JANE DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE GOT THERE 
PICK IT UP AND HAVE A LOOK 
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK 
IS IT ENGLISH OR IS IT ORIENTAL 
I WOULD SAY PROBABLY ORIENTAL 
ROBERTA COME ON 
CAN I HAZARD A GUESS POSSIBLY ENGLISH AT A GUESS 
YES YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S ENGLISH 
THIS IS SO GOOD I LOVE ENGLISH POTTERY 
WHAT IS NICE ABOUT THIS THIS IS PEARLWARE 
YOU KNOW WEDGWOOD AND ITS CREAMWARE 
THEY DID THIS WONDERFUL FROG SERVICE FOR CATHERINE THE GREAT OF RUSSIA 
THE NEXT POTTERY THAT STOLE THE MARKET WAS THIS PEARLWARE 
WHICH WAS CHEAPLY PRODUCED A VERY FINE WHITE BODIED CLAY WITH A BLUE TINTED GLAZE 
SO IT GIVES THIS PEARL EFFECT TO IT 
THIS DESIGN HERE IS ACTUALLY MOULDED 
SO WHEN IT WAS PUT ON TO THE MOULD THAT WAS ALREADY EXISTING 
IT WASN'T HAND MODELLED INDIVIDUALLY 
THE ACTUAL DECORATION IN THE MIDDLE THAT IS HAND PAINTED 
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT SO MUCH IS THIS RIDICULOUS CHINESE FIGURE CAN YOU SEE IT 
AND LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THE PAVILION HE'S BIGGER THAN THE PAVILION 
IT'S THIS SORT OF ECCENTRICITY THAT I LOVE ABOUT THESE DECORATED WARES PRODUCED IN STAFFORDSHIRE 
IN FACT ALL THE MAJOR POTTERIES IN THE COUNTRY PRODUCED PEARLWARE 
BUT WHAT SORT OF AGE IS IT WELL YOU CAN SEE IT'S NIBBLED 
UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO NIBBLING 
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT AROUND ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY 
THAT SORT OF PERIOD 
I ALWAYS ASSOCIATE THIS WITH THE LEEDS STAFFORDSHIRE AREA 
NOW I'M GOING TO SUGGEST WE OUGHT TO GO FOR THIS 
IT'S A NICE PIECE OF PERIOD POETRY 
AS FAR AS I CAN SEE TURN IT OVER AND LET'S LOOK AT THE BACK 
THERE'S NO DAMAGE OTHER THAN NIBBLING 
CAN YOU SEE THIS PEARL LUSTRE EFFECT YES YES I LOVE IT 
WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY IS BOTH OF YOU LIKE IT DON'T YOU 
YES WE DO LET'S BUY IT 
IF YOU CAN NEGOTIATE ANYTHING TUCKED UNDER THE ONE HUNDRED MARK GO FOR IT 
GO ON YOU WERE SO GOOD LAST TIME 
I OPT THAT YOU DO IT AGAIN 
HAVE FAITH IT'S UP TO YOU GOOD CHOICE 
JANE DOES AND PURCHASES THE PLATE FOR EIGHTY 
NOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY CAUGHT MY EYE 
IT'S A VERY NICE PIECE DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS FROM A FIRST LOOK 
YES THAT WOULD BE A SMALL BOX 
IT'S ACTUALLY AN APOTHECARY CABINET 
SO IT'S A TRAVELLING DOCTOR'S CABINET 
HE WOULD HAVE KEPT ALL HIS BOTTLES AND POTIONS AND POISONS IN HERE 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK INSIDE 
IT DOES NEED A LITTLE T. L. C. 
WE CAN SEE HERE THAT IT'S GOT ITS ORIGINAL BOTTLES 
NICE GLASS BOTTLES WITH THEIR STOPPERS 
THEY'RE NOT ALL IN PERFECT CONDITION BUT THAT ONE HAS GOT ITS LABEL THERE WHICH IS QUITE NICE 
IT WOULD HAVE HAD A METAL ROD HERE WHAT WE CALL A SECURING PIN 
WHICH WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM OF THIS DRAWER HERE 
YOU WOULD HAVE LIFTED IT OUT AND IT WOULD HAVE RELEASED THE DRAWER 
O. K. SO WHAT IS IN THE DRAWER THIS IS THE THING IT'S LOCKED 
BUT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET HOLD OF A KEY HOPEFULLY 
DO YOU THINK THE LAUDANUM WAS IN THERE IT COULD HAVE BEEN 
PROBABLY SOME POISONOUS SUBSTANCE 
THAT YOU WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE YOUR MITTS ON SO WHAT SORT OF AGE 
IT'S PROBABLY MID NINETEENTH CENTURY IT MIGHT BE A BIT EARLIER 
BUT IT'S A GREAT PIECE GOOD CONDITION 
I LIKE IT WELL IT LOOKS A BIT BROKEN 
O. K. IT'S NOT IN PERFECT CONDITION 
I'D BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT BUT IT'S WALNUT NORMALLY THEY ARE MAHOGANY OR ROSEWOOD 
AND IT'S GOT BEAUTIFUL BANDING 
WHICH IS SOMETHING YOU DON'T REALLY FIND IN APOTHECARY CABINETS 
THEY ARE NORMALLY QUITE PLAIN 
IT HAS GOT A BIT OF DAMAGE ON THE BACK AS WELL 
YOU CAN SEE HERE THE VENEER HAS LIFTED CAN THAT BE FIXED 
THAT CAN BE FIXED NOT TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM 
WELL I THINK IT'S SMALL I WANTED SOMETHING BIG 
YOU WANTED SOMETHING TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION AND IT DOESN'T 
WELL THIS IS MARTIN'S TERRITORY THIS IS YOUR SORT OF THING 
IT'S NICE QUALITY 
PERHAPS THE PRICE MIGHT CHANGE YOUR MIND A BIT 
THEY'RE ASKING THREE HUNDRED TWENTY OH COME ON 
WHICH I KNOW IS WAY OVER OUR BUDGET LET'S GO BUY SOMETHING BIG 
BUT I MANAGED TO DO SOME TALKING AND I'VE GOT IT FOR TWO HUNDRED 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THAT'S A LOT OFF ISN'T IT 
IT IS A LOT OFF I THINK TO BE HONEST I'VE SEEN THESE SELL FOR WAY OVER THREE HUNDRED 
I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE A PROFIT ON THIS 
I JUST HOPE THE RIGHT PEOPLE ARE THERE AT THE AUCTION 
IT'S A GOOD THING ARE YOU GOING TO TRUST ME ON THIS 
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO TRUST YOU 
I THINK IT'S A GOOD BUY AT TWO HUNDRED O. K. 
I THINK IT'S MORE LIKE GOODBYE TO TWO HUNDRED 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT COME ON 
LET'S HOPE THEY'RE WRONG DOCTOR 
THE REDS ARE CAMPAIGNING FOR A GOOD PRICE AT AUCTION 
WITH THEIR MIRROR BOUGHT FOR SIXTY FIVE 
THEY HAVE THE JARDINIERE BREATHING FIRE AT A HEFTY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY 
AND THEY HOPE TO MAKE A GOOD PROFIT 
ON THE PEARLY PLATE BOUGHT FOR EIGHTY SMACKERS 
SO GIRLS YOU SPENT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE 
VERY GOOD SHOPPING TOO 
TWENTY FIVE LEFTOVER LOLLY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
NOW DAVID BIT OF A CHALLENGE ISN'T IT NOT AN AWFUL LOT THERE 
THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE TIM YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD EXPERT 
DAVID BARBY YOU'LL HAVE NO TROUBLE FINDING SOMETHING DAZZLING FOR TWENTY FIVE 
AND YOU'RE SO TRUTHFUL 
AND YOU'RE SO MODEST 
THE BLUES ARE STEAMING OFF TO AUCTION 
WITH THEIR TEA CADDY BOUGHT FOR THIRTY THREE 
THEY ACQUIRED THE MEDICINE CABINET FOR A SWOON INDUCING TWO HUNDRED SMACKERS 
FINALLY THE SMALL BUT BEAUTIFULLY FORMED INDOOR BOWLS 
WERE SCOOPED UP FOR A COOL THIRTY 
WELL DONE BOYS YOU SPENT TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THREE THAT'S EXCELLENT SHOPPING 
SO I WANT THIRTY SEVEN WORTH OF LEFTOVER LOLLY THAT'S FOR YOU 
THANK YOU VICAR NOW HERE WE GO MA'AM 
WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THAT DARLING 
OH I CAN DO SOMETHING SPECIAL WITH THAT OH THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THE GIRL 
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY IS THIS WONDERFUL HOUSE 
AND I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING TRULY ELECTRIFYING 
FIRST THERE WAS CANDLELIGHT 
AND THEN 
THERE WAS ELECTRIC LIGHT 
HERE IN THE DINING ROOM WE'VE GOT SOME WONDERFUL EXAMPLES OF EARLY ELECTRIC LIGHT FITTINGS 
THESE PENDANT LIGHTS INCORPORATE A SHADE 
MADE AT THE WHITEFRIARS GLASSWORKS BY JAMES POWELL 
THEY'RE INTRIGUINGLY FRILLY AND HAVE WITHIN THEM 
A STRIATION OF YELLOWISH GLASS CALLED VASELINE GLASS 
WHAT I THINK'S RIVETING ABOUT THESE THINGS IS THAT THESE ARE VERY EARLY ELECTRIC LIGHT FITTINGS 
THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT ELECTRICITY BURNS ENTIRELY CLEANLY 
SO THEY STILL PRODUCED AN ELECTRIC LIGHT FITTING 
WITH A LITTLE FRILLY GLASS SHADE RIGHT UP AT THE CEILING LEVEL 
JUST IN CASE THEY THOUGHT SOME MUCK MIGHT BE GIVEN OFF BY THE ELECTRIC LIGHT BULB 
THEY MADE A VIRTUE OF THE WIRING ITSELF OFTEN LEAVING IT EXPOSED 
AND POWELL HAS DESIGNED THESE CURIOUS CURLICUES OF GLASS 
TO WRAP AROUND THE WIRE TO MAKE THE WHOLE THING DECORATIVE 
IN FACT YOU WANTED TO SHOW OFF TO YOUR NEIGHBOURS AND SAY I'VE GOT ELECTRICITY IN MY HOUSE 
JAMES BEALE THE OWNER WORKED WITH PHILIP WEBB THE ARCHITECT 
WHO WAS KEEN TO USE POWELL TO DESIGN ALL THE LIGHT FITTINGS IN THE HOUSE 
WAS BENSON BUSINESS PARTNER OF WILLIAM MORRIS WAS A SPECIALIST IN METAMORPHIC LAMPS 
HE WAS A MANUFACTURER OF METALWORK 
LIKE THIS PETAL FORMED TRAY AND THE INSULATED JUGS PLACED UPON IT 
BUT HIS BEST KNOWN PRODUCTION WAS THE LIGHT FITTINGS 
WELL MR. BENSON PRODUCED A FRAME WHICH IS THIS ONE 
OUT OF CAST BRASS IN JUST THE SAME WAY AS HE WOULD HAVE 
PRODUCED AN OIL LAMP BASE IN THE OLD DAYS 
EXCEPT THAT HE CURVED UP THE BACK FRAME TO RECEIVE THE BULB HOLDER IN THE TOP 
THAT BULB HOLDER IS ADJUSTABLE 
SO THAT I COULD MAKE THE LIGHT SHADE GO UP OR DOWN 
AND DIRECT THAT FIFTEEN WATTS WORTH OF LIGHT WHEREVER YOU WANT IT ON THE TABLE 
THIS LAMP IS HOWEVER ALSO METAMORPHIC 
WHICH MEANS IT MOVES FROM BEING ONE THING TO ANOTHER 
HERE IT SITS AS A TABLE LAMP BUT IF YOU WANTED A WALL LAMP 
ALL YOU DO IS TO PICK IT UP 
AND THAT OPEN FRAME WITH A LITTLE NIP IN THE BACK 
IS DESIGNED TO ACCEPT A SCREW AND HEY PRESTO YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF A WALL LAMP 
THE IDEAL COMBO WALL LAMP POT FITTING ISN'T THAT CLEVER 
THE QUESTION IS WILL OUR BRIGHT SPARK CONTESTANTS 
COME UP WITH ANYTHING AS CLEVER AS THIS OVER AT THE AUCTION 
WE'RE GOING TO WANDER DOWN THE ROAD TO WASHINGTON 
THAT'S WASHINGTON WEST SUSSEX INCIDENTALLY NOT WASHINGTON D. C. 
WHERE THE PUNTERS HAVE ALREADY SPOTTED SOME OF OUR TEAMS' ITEMS 
BUT WHAT WILL THE AUCTIONEER THINK 
VERY NICE TO BE AT TOOVEY'S AUCTIONEERS IN WASHINGTON IN WEST SUSSEX 
WITH RUPERT TOOVEY THE MAN OF THE MOMENT 
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN TIM VERY GOOD TO SEE YOU 
AND ALSO TO HAVE YOUR BROTHER SELLING SIMULTANEOUSLY 
HE'S NICK ISN'T HE YEAH 
DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF COMPETITION BETWEEN YOU BROTHERS ONLY FRIENDLY COMPETITION GLAD TO HEAR IT 
ANYWAY ROBERTA AND JANE OUR REDS WERE ADVISED BY DAVID BARBY 
AND THEIR FIRST ITEM IS THIS SO CALLED CAMPAIGN MAHOGANY SWING MIRROR 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT WELL CAMPAIGN TASTE REALLY ISN'T IT 
YES IT DIDN'T DO A LOT OF TRAVELLING BATHROOM TO DRESSING ROOM I THINK 
THEY'RE TRYING TO INSINUATE THAT IT WENT UP THE HIMALAYAS ON THE BACK OF A DONKEY 
BUT IT'S STILL WONDERFUL TASTE ISN'T IT 
HOW MUCH THEN I THINK WE'VE GOT IT IN AT FORTY TO SIXTY 
SIXTY FIVE THEY PAID IT'S A BIT MUCH ISN'T IT 
I'VE GOT A FEELING ABOUT IT I THINK THEY MAY JUST BE LUCKY 
YOU'RE OPTIMISTIC THAT'S WHAT WE LOVE ABOUT COMING TO TOOVEY'S 
NEXT UP THEN IS THIS CACHEPOT 
SOLID BRONZE AND IT IS A LUMP ISN'T IT IT IS A BIG THING 
LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY CHINESE AND CAST VERY WELL FOR AN EXPORT PIECE 
WITH THE DRAGON CHASING THE FLAMING PEARL WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
IT'S HOW THE DRAGON GETS HIS FIERY BREATH OF WISDOM TIM 
VERY GOOD SO WHAT'S IT WORTH IT'S IN AT FORTY TO SIXTY 
OH DEAR THAT'S NOT SO WISE 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY DAVID BARBY AND THE TEAM PAID FOR THAT 
IT DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE REALLY 
I DON'T THINK SO EVEN THE MOST OPTIMISTIC RUPERT TOOVEY CAN'T ENCOURAGE THAT TO ONE HUNDRED THIRTY CAN YOU 
I WISH YOU WISH 
I KNOW YOU'LL TRY YOUR BEST BUT THAT COULD BE THEIR HOLE THEIR BOTTOMLESS PIT COULD BE 
O. K. NOW THE PEARLWARE PLATE OF COURSE DAVID BARBY'S BONKERS ABOUT CERAMICS DO YOU LIKE PEARLWARE 
I LOVE PEARLWARE THAT EARLY EARTHENWARE NEARLY MADE MEISSEN BANKRUPT DIDN'T IT 
IT CERTAINLY DID BUT WILL THAT BANKRUPT THE TEAMS 
WHAT'S THE ESTIMATE I THINK THIRTY TO FIFTY IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE DO YOU 
OH DEAR BARBY WILL BE DISAPPOINTED EIGHTY HE PAID FOR THAT 
THAT'S THE PASSION OF A COLLECTOR I'M AFRAID IT IS ISN'T IT 
SEEMS TO ME THEY'RE GONNA NEED THEIR BONUS BUY LET'S GO AND SEE IT 
NOW DAVID YOU HAD TWENTY TO SPEND WHAT DID YOU BUY 
SOMETHING OF QUALITY TIM 
NOW LOOK AT THAT ISN'T IT SUPERB 
AN EDWARDIAN LADY'S HAT PIN 
TWISTED TORTOISESHELL WITH THESE LITTLE SILVER ELEMENTS TO RETAIN IT 
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL A LONG SPIKE 
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL 
I PAID TWENTY FOR IT 
VERY GOOD YOU DIDN'T LEAVE ME AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY YOU KNOW 
SO YOU GONNA LET THEM HOLD IT 
WELL I RATHER LIKE IT ACTUALLY 
SO LET'S HAVE A PREDICTION AS TO WHAT IT'S GOING TO MAKE IN THE AUCTION DAVID 
IT'S A COLLECTOR'S ITEM AND I THINK PROBABLY THIRTY TO FORTY MIGHT DOUBLE YOUR MONEY MM HMM 
THANK YOU DAVID ONE HOPES 
IT'S A GOOD AGATHA CHRISTIE PIERCER ISN'T IT ABSOLUTELY 
GET SOMEONE IN THE HEART WITH THAT ONE YOU'D KNOW ALL ABOUT IT 
WE'VE HEARD HIS PREDICTION MAYBE TWENTY PROFIT ON A TWENTY PURCHASE PRICE 
WELL DONE DAVID LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS 
SO THERE IT IS RUPERT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT 
LOVELY TASTE ISN'T IT 
JUST RIGHT FOR THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY THAT TORTOISESHELL TWIST IS BEAUTIFUL THEY GOT A GOOD BUY 
DO YOU THINK THAT'S SILVER THAT LITTLE CLASP 
HAS THAT QUALITY DOESN'T IT DEFINITELY 
GOOD AND THERE ARE COLLECTORS OF HAT PINS 
YES STILL IN A MULTITUDE ACTUALLY ANYWAY GOOD CONDITION HOW MUCH 
WE'VE ESTIMATED AT TWENTY TO FORTY BUT THAT MIGHT BE ONE OF OUR CHEEKIER ESTIMATES 
WHAT YOU THINK IT'S TOO LOW AT TWENTY TO FORTY I DO OH I THINK IT WILL DO BETTER THAN THAT 
WELL BARBY DID VERY WELL BECAUSE HE PAID TWENTY BUT WE SHALL SEE 
NOW NEXT UP ARE THE BLUES THEY GOT STEERED TOWARDS THIS TEA CADDY GLAMOROUS WOOD ROSEWOOD ISN'T IT 
IT IS AND THAT'S WELL FIGURED 
YEAH VERY PRETTY SHAPE TOO THE SARCOPHAGUS FORM ISN'T IT 
SOME WOULD SAY YESTERDAY'S ANTIQUES BUT ACTUALLY IF YOU WANTED A LITTLE BOX ON YOUR DRESSING TABLE 
SHOVE BITS AND BOBS IN YOU COULDN'T HAVE A BETTER THING COULD YOU 
TREMENDOUS VALUE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT VALUE THEN HOW MUCH 
THIRTY TO FIFTY I RECKON 
O. K. THIRTY THREE SHE PAID WELL THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT 
YEAH AND TO BUY THAT IN A FAIR FOR THIRTY THREE IS NOT BAD JOLLY GOOD EFFORT 
SO THERE'S A CHANCE OF A PROFIT YES GREAT 
NOW THE APOTHECARY'S CABINET 
CATHERINE SOUTHON BEING A GREAT SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENT EXPERT SHE WILL LOVE THIS SHE IS ISN'T SHE 
I THINK IT'S A REAL FAVOURITE OF MINE 
I LOVE THE CHECKER STRINGING I LIKE THE FAKE DRAWERS AT THE FRONT I LIKE THAT BRACKET HANDLE ON THE TOP 
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF STUFF I REALLY LIKE ABOUT IT 
AND FITTED WITH THE BOTTLES INSIDE LOVELY GEORGE THE THIRD THING 
VERY NICE IT COULD BE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY EIGHTEEN HUNDRED OR JUST AFTER WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I THINK ON THE CUSP OF THE CENTURIES AS I SEE IT YES GOOD 
IT'S A BIT ROUGH THOUGH ISN'T IT 
PLAYWORN 
PLAYWORN I THINK IT'S A MARVELLOUS COLLECTOR'S PIECE 
BUT THE CONDITION IS AGAINST IT 
I THINK IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO OVER THE HILL 
SO MY ESTIMATE IS SEVENTY TO ONE HUNDRED TIM IS IT TWO HUNDRED SHE PAID 
WELL WE'LL SEE WE WILL 
WHAT ABOUT THESE WHAT I CALL TABLE BOWLS WHAT DO YOU CALL THESE THINGS 
I'M NAUGHTY I'M CALLING THEM CARPET BOWLS

AND I GUESS ON A WET DAY WHEN YOU WANTED TO BE OUTSIDE BOWLING 
YOU'D HAVE A LITTLE PLAY INDOORS WITH THIS SO WHAT ARE THEY WORTH 
WE'VE PUT THIRTY TO FORTY GREAT THEY PAID THIRTY AND I THINK THEY MIGHT DO EVEN A BIT BETTER THAN THAT

YOU'D BETTER SHOW US WHAT YOU SPENT THIRTY SEVEN ON 
TA D. A. 
WHAT WELL 
WE'VE GOT ANOTHER SMALL THING 
I KNOW I KNOW YOU WANTED BIG BUT UNUSUAL 
WELL IT IS ANY IDEAS 
IS IT A VERY OLD CRIMPING IRON 
FOR YOUR HAIR EXACTLY THAT'LL COME IN HANDY 
ABSOLUTELY 
CLOSE BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY ART NOUVEAU WMF GERMAN ASPARAGUS TONGS 
OF COURSE THEY ARE 
LITTLE PIECES OF ASPARAGUS WOULD SLOT IN HERE AND THEN YOU'RE SERVING IT AT YOUR DINNER PARTY 
AREN'T THEY FANTASTIC NO IT IS STYLISH OF COURSE IT IS 
AND I'VE GOT A LOT MORE CONFIDENCE IN THIS THAN ANYTHING MARTIN CHOSE QUITE HONESTLY 
THAT'S GOOD IT'S THE SORT OF PIECE OF KIT THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO BE WITHOUT RIGHT 
NO OF COURSE NOT I WONDER HOW I'VE MANAGED NOW 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH 
I THINK WE'VE GOT A CHANCE WITH THIS 
I PAID FIFTEEN WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A BIT OF A BARGAIN ACTUALLY YEAH 
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE MIGHT GET WE MIGHT DOUBLE OUR MONEY PLUS 
I THINK WE MIGHT GET FORTY THAT'D BE GOOD BEING A BIT OPTIMISTIC BUT 
I MEAN HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE A NICE PAIR OF ASPARAGUS TONGS 
NOT NEARLY OFTEN ENOUGH 
THAT'S GREAT WELL I TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO 
FOR THE VIEWERS AT HOME WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS 
SO SUSSEX IS WELL KNOWN FOR ITS ASPARAGUS ISN'T IT 
IT CERTAINLY IS SO THESE SHOULD BE POPULAR HERE 
THEY CERTAINLY WILL BE WMF 
IT'S A NAME TO CONJURE WITH IT'S STAMPED JUST HERE OH YES 
AND WITH THE INITIAL SO WE'RE POST NINETEEN FOURTEEN RIGHT 
LOVELY DESIGN ISN'T IT VERY NICE TOO 
I MEAN GOODNESS ONLY KNOWS WHO WOULD SERIOUSLY USE THEM BUT THEY'RE VERY DECORATIVE 
WHERE'S THE LOCAL ASPARAGUS SHOP ROUND THE CORNER 
ALWAYS GOT THE ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING OLD RUPE WHAT ARE THEY WORTH MATE 
WELL I'VE PUT TWENTY TO FORTY 
GOOD FIFTEEN SHE PAID THEY'VE GOT TO BE A STEAL AT FIFTEEN HAVEN'T THEY 
I THINK THEY'LL DO BETTER THAN THAT DO YOU REALLY I DO 
THIS IS TURNING OUT TO BE EXCITING 
A LOT OF THE FURNITURE IN THESE SALES IS BROWN 
BUT THERE'S SPECIAL BROWN AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PIECES 
IT'S SOMETHING CALLED A DAVENPORT A PECULIARLY VICTORIAN PIECE OF FURNITURE 
IT'S MADE OF BURR WALNUT AND AT FIRST SIGHT THIS BROWN IS NOT VERY STUNNING 
WHAT MAKES IT SPECIAL 
WELL FIRST OF ALL IT'S GOT WHAT THEY CALL A PIANO FRONT 
AND IF I OPEN IT UP LIKE THAT IT REVEALS A PERFECTLY NICE WRITING SURFACE 
I CAN PULL THAT SURFACE OUT AND YOU'VE GOT A RATCHETED BOOK SLIDE 
AND IF I TAKE IT UP LIKE THAT YOU COULD LEAN YOUR FAVOURITE JANE AUSTEN NOVEL ON THAT SURFACE 
AND HAVE A LITTLE READ IN GREAT COMFORT 
IF YOU WANTED DO A BIT OF WRITING THOUGH YOU'D PUT THE RATCHET DOWN 
AND INSIDE THESE DRAWERS YOU'D KEEP YOUR SECRET LOVE LETTERS 
BUT IF YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING REALLY SECRET THAT YOU REALLY DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY TO GET AT 
YOU MIGHT POP YOUR LITTLE FINGER IN THERE PULL A LEVER OH LOOK AT THAT 
THE THING IS SPRING LOADED IN THE BACK OF THE SUPERSTRUCTURE 
AND WHEN I PULLED THAT LEVER UP IT POPPED 
SHALL WE HAVE ANOTHER DEMO 
TO PUT IT DOWN 
YOU SQUEEZE DOWN UNTIL IT MAKES THAT RATCHET CLICK LIKE THAT 
STANDING BY FOR THIS 
BOING UP IT COMES ISN'T THAT MARVELLOUS 
THAT'S A SPECIAL FEATURE 
IT'S CALLED A HARLEQUIN THAT MEANS IT TURNS FROM ONE THING TO ANOTHER 
SO THIS IS A HARLEQUIN PIANO FRONT DAVENPORT 
AND IF I HINGE THAT TOP 
YOU CAN SEE THAT IT OPENS TO REVEAL A WHOLE LOT OF COMPARTMENTS 
FOR ALL YOUR STATIONERY OR MORE LOVE NOTES 
AND THE SIDES DON'T FORGET ARE ALSO FITTED WITH DRAWERS 
AND IF I PULL THOSE OUT YOU CAN SEE IT'S A GRADUATED SET OF FOURDRAWERS 
REAL DRAWERS ON ONE SIDE AND DUMMY DRAWERS ON THE OTHER 
THAT MEANS THEY DON'T OPEN 
THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS THIS COLOUR 
THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF MONEY TO BE SPENT ON THE RESTORATION 
AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHY THE AUCTIONEERS HAVE ESTIMATED IT AT ONLY ONE THOUSAND TO ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
ONE OF THESE THINGS BRILLIANT AND IN GREAT ORDER 
YOU'D SEE PRICED UP IN A FAIR AT PROBABLY THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
ANYWAY IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE AUCTION
