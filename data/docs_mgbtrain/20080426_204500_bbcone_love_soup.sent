RIGHT MR. STURGEON YOU CAN GET DRESSED NOW 
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO PROLONG THIS LUNACY ANY FURTHER DO WE 
IF TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF MEDICAL EXPERIENCE ARE ANYTHING TO GO BY 
I THINK I CAN SAY WITHOUT TOO MUCH RISK TO MY REPUTATION 
YOU'RE NOT IN FACT PREGNANT 
NOT PREGNANT 
WHAT SORT OF TALK IS THAT TO DASH A MAN'S DREAMS 
MORE OF YOUR FANCY SEXIST DOGMA 
YOU KNOW HOW I YEARN FOR A SON 
MR. STURGEON YOU'RE A SILLY MAN 
PLEASE GO AWAY AND STOP WASTING MY TIME 
I DEMAND A SECOND OPINION 
VERY WELL YOU HAVE APPALLING TASTE IN SOCKS 
NOW THEN WHAT ELSE HAVE WE GOT HERE 
DOCTORS YOU DON'T KNOW A THING 
DOCTORS TOLD MY FATHER HE'D SIX MONTHS TO LIVE BUT HE SHOWED THEM 
HE WAS DEAD WITHIN A WEEK 
YOU STRUGGLE ALL YOUR LIFE 
WHEN I WAS A BOY WE COULDN'T AFFORD A CILLA BLACK RECORD 
WE HAD TO PLUG THE CAT'S TAIL INTO THE LIGHT SOCKET 
NOW WHERE THE HELL'S THAT GONE 
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MY WATCH AT ALL IN YOUR TRAVELS 
I'M GONNA BE SO LATE IT'S NOT TRUE 
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS ABOMINATION 
TALK ABOUT A CLASH OF STYLES HE'S TURNING IT INTO A CIRCUS ACT 
I DON'T SUPPOSE GORDON BEXTER WILL BE LOSING ANY SLEEP OVER IT WILL HE 
YOU WITH YOUR FANCY BOOK LEARNING 
WHAT TIME YOU SAY THIS SHOW OF HIS STARTS TOMORROW 
THINK I'M GONNA HAVE TO CHANGE BEFORE I LEAVE WORK TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE 
UNBELIEVABLE IT'S LIKE DEAF PEOPLE ARE TOO MORONIC 
TO APPRECIATE THE HUMOUR WITHOUT THIS FACE PULLING AND SIGNPOSTING 
CONVINCED YOU WERE TURNING INTO A MARSUPIAL 
WHEN IN FACT YOU'D JUST PULLED YOUR UNDERPANTS UP TOO FAR 
THIS WAS QUITE A FUNNY SKETCH WHEN I WROTE IT SORRY 
OH NO NOT TILL EIGHT YOU'LL HAVE BAGS OF TIME I'M SURE SSS 
NO IDEA OF ANY KIND 
SO DID THOSE JUST COME THIS MORNING 
YEAH I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE AN IDEA TO TRY AND MUG UP ON SOME OF HIS STUFF 
FOR THAT DOCUMENTARY THIS AFTERNOON 
WHY ON EARTH THEY WANT TO INTERVIEW ME 
STILL CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GOING TO ACTUALLY MEET HIM 
AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS OF WATCHING HIM ON THE BOX 
SATURDAY NIGHTS AT HOME WITH MY MUM AND DAD 
YEAH WELL DON'T EXPECT HIM TO BE ALL JOEY JOEY 
COS HE'S ALSO GOT THIS VERY INTENSE 
ALMOST PERVERSELY NON COMMERCIAL SIDE TO HIS WORK HE THROWS HIMSELF INTO 
ONE MINUTE HE'S PLAYING WIDOW TWANKEY AT THE OLD VIC 
THEN HE'LL GO AWAY AND DIRECT SOME WEIRD PIECE OF AVANT GARDE DRAMA 
UPSTAIRS IN A PUB ONLY FIVE PEOPLE ARE GONNA GET 
LAST PLAY OF HIS I WENT TO 
THE CAST ALL FINISHED UP NAKED ONSTAGE 
WATCHING A WOMAN URINATE ON A MAN'S FACE 
O. K.

THE TWO OF US

JUST WHEN WE'D BOTH GIVEN UP HOPE 
MIRACLES CAN HAPPEN 
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THEN IF YOU WORK IT OUT 
YOU'RE A POKE IN CREDIT 
I I BEG YOUR PARDON 
IF YOU RECKON HE'S FORGIVEN YOU 
FOR AN ACT OF INFIDELITY THAT NEVER TOOK PLACE 
THAT MEANS YOU'VE GOT ONE IN THE BANK NOW FOR WHENEVER YOU FEEL LIKE IT 
YOU KNOW A GUIDED TOUR OF YOUR MORAL UNIVERSE 
WOULD BE A FASCINATING EXPERIENCE ONE OF THESE DAYS 
ALL I KNOW IT JUST SEEMS TO BE GETTING TOO HEAVY TOO FAST 
I NEED SOME SPACE

MY NEW ACTRESS FRIEND THE SOONER I CAN MOVE INTO HER FLAT 
WITH NO ASPERSIONS CAST OBVIOUSLY ON YOUR VERY COMFORTABLE SOFA 
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA WANT ME AROUND ARE YOU

WHEN THEY ARRIVED I WAS IN A BIT OF A STATE WITH MYSELF WASN'T I

WHEN HE CAME IN THROUGH THE DOOR 
HELLO LADIES WHAT'S GOING ON

THEN THAT WAS IT FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT 
SHE WENT INTO ONE OF HER MOODS GIVING ME SOME FILTHY STARES 
OH AND IS IT ANY WONDER THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB

OH PLEASE YOU HAVE JUST GOT A FILTHY IMAGINATION 
IF YOU'D SEEN THE LOOK ON HER FACE WHILE HE WAS DOING IT

BUT NOTHING LIKE YOU'RE IMAGINING 
YOU'VE GOT A ONE TRACK MIND MILLY RUSSELL A DIRT TRACK 
YEAH WELL I JUST LIKE TO KNOW WHERE MY BOYFRIENDS HAVE BEEN 
AND THE IDEA OF GOING ROUND WITH YOUR SHOP SOILED MERCHANDISE ODDLY ENOUGH 
DOES NOT APPEAL TO ME IN ANY WAY

NO I MEAN THE FACT YOU'RE TALKING IN THE PRESENT TENSE ABOUT THE MAN

OBVIOUSLY IT'S UM 
AN OBITUARY 
ARE YOU SERIOUS WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN 
I WAS JUST ON THE PHONE TO HIM THREE DAYS AGO 
OH NO HE'S HASN'T DIED

BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS HE HAD A MAJOR HEART OPERATION ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO 
SO YOU KNOW WE JUST HAVE TO BE READY TO ROLL AS IT WERE 
AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE 
SO IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND JUST RUNNING THAT BIT AGAIN 
OH GREAT THEY MANAGED TO ROPE YOU INTO THIS THING THEN AS WELL 
I SAID I'D GIVE THEM TEN MINUTES AS IT'S JUST ROUND THE CORNER 
SO HOW ARE THE NOSTRILS READING DO YOU WANT TO JUST 
DID THEY TELL YOU IT'S AN OBITUARY THEY'RE DOING

CHATTING UP THIS WOMAN WHO WAS REALLY UP TO SCRATCH YOU KNOW 
BLONDE LATE FORTIES 
WELL INTO HER FIFTH OR SIXTH VODKA BY THIS TIME 
WE'RE ENJOYING EACH OTHER'S COMPANY 
GRADUALLY I'M STARTING TO THINK 
I KNOW THIS PERSON FROM SOMEWHERE SURELY 
BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I COULDN'T PLACE HER 
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT JUST POPPED IN 
WHO SHE WAS 
MY WIFE 
COME AGAIN 
WELL YOU KNOW MY FIRST WIFE JANEY 
NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE TO EIGHTY SIX THE PAST TWENTY YEARS SHE'S BEEN LIVING IN L. A. 
WE'D COMPLETELY LOST TOUCH AND NOW HERE WE WERE 
IT'S LIKE WE'D NEVER MET BEFORE 
AND SHE DIDN'T RECOGNISE YOU 
WELL IN THE EIGHTIES I WAS A RAKE 
WITH A WHOLE POST HIPPY BEARD THING AND HAIR 
A FAR CRY FROM THE CLEAN CUT GASTRONOME OF TODAY 
SO NOW I WAS THINKING I'M JUST GONNA SIT ON THIS FOR A BIT 
SEE HOW LONG IT TAKES HER TO TWIG 
AND SO WE GET BACK TO HER PLACE AND STILL NOT A SUSPICION 
NOT AN INKLING 
UNTIL 
OH MY GOD LLOYD 
WHAT WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN 
OH WELL YOU KNOW LET'S JUST 
YEAH NEVER MIND 
SUFFICE TO REPORT WE'RE NOW RIGHT BACK IN BUSINESS 
AS A COUPLE AND A FAMILY COS SHE'S NOW GOT A DAUGHTER BY ANOTHER MARRIAGE 
AND I MEAN COME ON GREAT STORYLINE OR WHAT 
HUSBAND AND WIFE MEET UP FOR THE SECOND TIME AS COMPLETE STRANGERS 
AND FALL IN LOVE ALL OVER AGAIN 
SO YOU'RE BOTH WELL 
YOU'VE BEEN DOING SOMETHING WITH LLOYD DREWITT HAVEN'T YOU 
WHAT WAS THAT A COMEDY DRAMA 
WE DID A THING YES CALLED LOVE SOUP WHICH WAS 
BUT IT'S NOT BEEN OUT YET 
NO NO THE B. B. C. STILL HAVE TO SHOW IT I THINK TO THEIR KITCHEN STAFF 
BEFORE WE CAN GET A FINAL TRANSMISSION DATE SO 
WASN'T THAT GREAT THEY'RE DOING THIS BIG DOCUMENTARY ABOUT YOU 
DOUGLAS WAS INTERVIEWED I HOPE YOU SAID SOME NICE THINGS 
OH YOU MEAN THE OBITUARY 
THEY SEEM TO BE GETTING VERY CHI CHI WITH THE LOCATIONS I MUST SAY 
WHERE WAS IT THEY WERE FILMING LAST WEEK PALL MALL CLUB 
WWWW IT WAS 
BUT LISTEN I HONESTLY HAD NO IDEA GORDON COS 
I KNOW YOU LEAVE IT TO THE LAST MINUTE 
THERE'S NO TELLING WHO'LL END UP ON THE SCREEN SUMMARISING YOUR LIFE AND CAREER 
NICHOLAS BLOODY PARSONS 
I MEAN POOR OLD SPIKE MILLIGAN 
I MEAN CAN YOU BELIEVE THE NIGHT HE POPPED OFF 
CHANNEL FOUR NEWS THE BEST THEY COULD SCRAPE TOGETHER AT THE LAST MINUTE 
NICHOLAS BLOODY PARSONS 
I MEAN YOU TUNE IN HOPING FOR SOME DEEP DEFINING EULOGY 
SO SORRY YOU'RE SAYING YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT 
LAST MARCH I CAN TELL YOU THE MINUTE I GOT THROUGH THAT BY PASS 
I WAS STRAIGHT ON THE PHONE TO MICHAEL GRADE 
THE PRODUCER BLESS HER SHE'S YOU KNOW VERY YOUNG AND SWEET BUT 
SO GOD WILLING NOW WITH ALL THE PRESSURE OFF 
THEY HAVE AT LEAST GOT ENOUGH TIME TO PUT TOGETHER SOME HALF DECENT TESTIMONIALS 
OF WEIGHT AND RELEVANCE YOU KNOW 
DELIVERED HOPEFULLY BY SOME PEOPLE OF SUBSTANCE 
OH BY THE BY WE'RE BEING JOINED BY TWO OTHER GUESTS AT SUPPER 
OH RIGHT ULRICH AND STEFAN FROM STUTTGART 
STEFAN'S WRITTEN THIS PLAY THAT I'M DIRECTING AT THE ROYAL COURT NEXT WEEK 
THE SUBJECT MATTER OF WHICH MIGHT RAISE A FEW EYEBROWS 
CONTROVERSIAL 
WELL LET'S SAY DOUGLAS MORALLY CHALLENGING 
IT'S ABOUT NECROPHILIA 
I MEAN IT'S GOING TO UPSET PEOPLE OF COURSE 
BUT THAT IS ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS OF CONTEMPORARY DRAMA 
SURELY TO CREATE DEBATES 
I MEAN NOT TO BE AFRAID 
TO EXAMINE THE DARKER RECESSES OF WHAT MANKIND IS ALL ABOUT 
BECAUSE HAVING SEX WITH A CORPSE I SUPPOSE 
WOULD DEFINITELY BE A PRETTY DARK RECESS 
OF COURSE THAT IS ANOTHER MISCONCEPTION 
THAT STEFAN'S PLAY SEEKS TO CORRECT 
WRITTEN IF I MAY SAY BEAUTIFULLY FROM HIS OWN EXPERIENCE 
THAT THE CONDITION IS ALL ABOUT PSYCHOPATHS AND SERIAL KILLERS 
SO ERR STEFAN ACTUALLY WROTE THE PLAY IN GERMAN 
AND ULRICH HAS PROVIDED US WITH THE TRANSLATION 
AND IS OVER HERE NOW ESSENTIALLY TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL TALKING THE SAME LANGUAGE 
FOR ME I WOULD STRESS AS WITH ALL COMPULSIONS WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND 
NECROPHILIA IS NOT A CHOICE 
BUT A STATE OF MIND I MUST COME TO TERMS WITH 
I DON'T WISH TO HARM ANYONE 
I SIMPLY HAVE DESIRES I CANNOT EXPLAIN 
EVER SINCE WHEN I WAS THIRTEEN 
I SAW MY BEST FRIEND'S MOTHER LAID OUT IN HER COFFIN 
AND THOUGHT HOW CALM AND SERENE SHE LOOKED 
LIKE A MARBLE STATUE I WANTED TO KISS AND GENTLY CARESS 
TO FEEL AN EROTIC ATTRACTION ONLY TOWARDS A DECEASED PERSON OF COURSE IS VERY LIMITING 
TO ME THE DEAD ARE GRACEFUL AND SENSUAL AND FULL OF MYSTERY 
THESE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ARE IN MY MIND JUST FANTASIES BUT 
OF COURSE IT MAKES IT VERY HARD TO FIND GIRLFRIENDS 
AND SO THE ACTUAL STORY OF THIS PLAY KISS OF DEATH 
YOU WERE SAYING IS 
YES IT'S ABOUT A YOUNG WOMAN WHO FALLS IN LOVE 
EXCUSE ME I'M SO SORRY TO INTERRUPT 
WOULD YOU MIND IF MY HUSBAND TOOK A PHOTOGRAPH OF US TOGETHER 
WAS IT MY IMAGINATION OR WAS THAT GUY STEFAN CHECKING ME OUT TONIGHT 
I MEAN WHY WOULD HE BE INTERESTED IN ME 
I'M NOT A CORPSE 
OH MY GOD I AM 
WHAT IS THIS RELATIONSHIP IF NOT NECROPHILIA LOOK AT US 
HE'S DOING ALL THE WORK AND I'M JUST LYING HERE LIKE DEAD MEAT 
HOW MUCH LONGER CAN I GO ON PRETENDING 
WELL THAT WAS REALLY REALLY SCRUMMY 
YOU'VE DEFINITELY HAD SUFFICIENT 
I WON'T NEED TO EAT FOR A WEEK NOW 
I WOULD THINK BETWEEN THAT QUART OF CLAM AND STILTON CHOWDER 
AND THE THREE HELPINGS OF VENISON PIE YOU JUST FORCE FED THEM 
THEY'LL SURVIVE FOR A BIT 
FEEL LIKE I'M CARRYING A BOWLING BALL ROUND IN MY STOMACH 
THANK YOU YOU SOUND LIKE MY LAST HUSBAND 
FOREVER WHINGEING I WAS PUTTING TOO MUCH ON HIS PLATE OH RIGHT 
WHERE IS HE NOW IN AN OXYGEN TENT 
LOVELY PLACE YOU'VE GOT HERE JANEY 
SO ISN'T THAT GREAT ABOUT MEETING LLOYD AGAIN 
I KNOW 
AND YOU AND DOUGLAS SEEM TO BE 
YES 
UM 
OH DEAR 
WHAT PROBLEMS 
NO NO NO NO PROBLEMS REALLY 
IS IT OBVIOUS 
TO SOMEONE LIKE ME 
WHO'S BEEN AROUND THE BLOCK AND BACK ENOUGH TIMES TO KNOW BETTER 
RIGHT COS I SUPPOSE YOU'VE LISTEN MY THIRD HUSBAND GERRY 
EVEN AS I WAS SAYING I DO I WAS THINKING I DON'T IF I'M HONEST 
NOT REALLY AND OF COURSE A FEW MONTHS LATER THERE I AM 
MY OWN BOWLING BALL IN THE STOMACH 
WHO I LOVE AND ADORE OBVIOUSLY TOTALLY 
BUT GOD KNOWS IT DOESN'T MAKE IT EASY 
IT'S JUST WHEN YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IF YOU SAID ANYTHING IT'S GOING TO 
EXCEPT TRUST ME ALICE THE MORE YOU RUN AWAY FROM IT 
I KNOW I KNOW 
I KNOW 
WHAT A NIGHT OH SORRY 
YOU DON'T MIND IF I JUST 
IT'S ALL THAT WINE YESTERDAY AT LLOYD AND JANEY'S 
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU JUST THINK YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE TO 
DOUGLAS I THINK WE SHOULD CALL IT OFF 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
I MEAN 
I'M JUST GETTING MORE AND MORE WORRIED 
ABOUT HOW SERIOUSLY YOU'RE TAKING ALL THIS 
AND WHEREAS NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY 
I'M SO SORRY 
COS OBVIOUSLY I'M VERY FOND OF YOU OF COURSE I AM IT'S JUST THAT 
WHATEVER IT IS MISSING PIECE OF THE JIGSAW 
THAT HAS TO BE THERE FOR BOTH OF US DOESN'T IT 
OR ELSE 
I MEAN WE DO JUST HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST WITH EACH OTHER DON'T YOU THINK 
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'RE JUST 
AND I MEAN THERE'S NO BASIS AT ALL FOR US TO GO ON 
DON'T YOU THINK 
AND HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING 
IT WAS LIKE HE JUST TOTALLY FROZE OVER FROM SHOCK 
AND SO BY NOW I'D COMPLETELY RUN OUT OF THINGS TO SAY 
AND SUDDENLY I'VE BECOME HORRIBLY AWARE I'M NOT HIS GIRLFRIEND ANYMORE OR PARTNER 
I'M JUST THIS PATHETIC NAKED WOMAN SITTING IN HIS BATH 
AND ANY SECOND I HAVE TO STAND UP RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM AND GET OUT AND LEAVE 
I TELL YOU IT WAS NOT THE MOST DIGNIFIED OF EXITS 
STILL AT LEAST IT'S DONE NOW 
AND YOU'LL FEEL BETTER FOR IT IN THE LONG RUN FOR DOING IT WHEN YOU DID 
YES AND HOW'S THIS FOR TIMING 
I'VE JUST HAD AN INVITATION COME THROUGH 
TO GO AND SEE THAT PLAY AS A PERSONAL GUEST OF STEFAN 
THAT GERMAN GUY YOU REMEMBER I TOLD YOU ABOUT 
OH GOD THE ONE WHO'S INTO 
WELL HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE 
HE SPEAKS NO ENGLISH AND I SPEAK NO GERMAN 
BUT YOU DID SAY THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIM 
I KNOW THAT'S WHAT SCARES ME 
IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING I LIKE 
MATE SHE'S NICKING YOUR MONEY 
WELL THANK YOU ALICE FOR YOUR SUPPORT TONIGHT AND YOUR COMPANY 
I HAVE ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH 
AND THANK YOU FOR A REALLY INTERESTING EVENING 
AND THE PLAY WHICH WAS 
WELL STIMULATING 
IT GIVES ME MUCH PLEASURE TO KNOW I HAVE STIMULATED YOU 
AND OF COURSE THE NIGHT IS NOT YET OVER 
NO NO IT'S UM 
TECHNICALLY NO THAT'S 
I HAVE NEVER SAID THIS BEFORE ALICE TO ANY OTHER WOMAN 
BUT IN THE SHORT TIME SINCE I MET YOU 
I FEEL DEEP INSIDE IT IS VERY HARD FOR ME TO SAY BUT 
PHYSICALLY AROUSED BY YOUR PRESENCE 
AT THIS MINUTE I TRULY BELIEVE IF YOU WOULD COME BACK TO MY HOTEL 
I COULD MAKE LOVE TO YOU ALICE 
OH BUT NO NO FORGIVE ME PLEASE 
WE HARDLY KNOW EACH OTHER 
AND AS I WAS THERE WITH HIM IN THE LIFT 
LIKE PUTTY BETWEEN HIS LIPS I'M THINKING 
HELP IS ANYTHING GOING TO SAVE ME TONIGHT FROM MYSELF 
AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT 
AT THAT MOMENT IT CAME 
IT TURNS OUT SHE WAS A JOURNALIST WHO WAS OVER HERE WRITING 
A FEATURE ABOUT THE PLAY FOR SOME MAGAZINE OR OTHER 
AND WHAT A RELIEF 
WHEN I GOT AWAY BACK TO MILLY'S 
AND MANAGED TO PULL MYSELF TOGETHER I WAS JUST 
OH HELLO 
SO WHAT A HUGE SHAME ABOUT YOU AND DOUGLAS 
OH I KNOW IT'S JUST ME LLOYD 
THAT IS THE PATTERN SADLY OF MY WHOLE EXISTENCE 
TRYING TO FIT IN ALL MY FLAWS AND FEARS 
AND STRANGE PECULIAR HANG UPS 
AROUND SOMEONE ELSE'S PERFECTLY WELL ORDERED LIFE 
THEY SHOULD PROBABLY WRITE A PLAY ABOUT ME 
GIVE GORDON BEXTER SOMETHING REALLY WEIRD TO GET HIS TEETH INTO NEXT TIME 
OH RIGHT YOU WON'T HAVE UM 
WELL NO 
COS THEY'RE NOT RELEASING IT TILL LATER TODAY REMEMBER 
BECAUSE OF THE FAMILY 
SORRY WHAT'S THIS 
NO IT'S GORDON BEXTER THEY RECKON HIS HEART SUDDENLY GAVE OUT 
HALF WAY THROUGH THE SHOW LAST NIGHT NO 
APPARENTLY HE WAS DOING A WASHBOARD NUMBER AS WIDOW TWANKY 
AT THE FRONT OF THE STAGE AND KEELED OVER INTO THE ORCHESTRA PIT 
GOT THE BIGGEST LAUGH OF THE NIGHT 
OH DON'T 
TOOK THE PARAMEDICS FIVE MINUTES TO CUT THROUGH HIS BRA 
TO TRY AND REVIVE HIM BUT ALL IN VAIN APPARENTLY 
HE DIED HALF AN HOUR LATER IN THE AMBULANCE 
AND OF COURSE WHAT WAS SO TERRIFIC AND SO DELICIOUS 
ABOUT BEXTER'S WHOLE APPROACH TO HIS ART 
BECAUSE HE WAS I THINK IN A VERY REAL SENSE AN ARTIST 
WAS THE TRULY MAGICAL WAY HE MANAGED TO ENGAGE WITH THE AUDIENCE 
TO GO BEYOND THE JOKE BEYOND THE LAUGH 
HOW CAN THEY BE SUCH HYPOCRITES 
THIS ONE USED TO WRITE THE MOST VILE THINGS EVERY WEEK IN HIS COLUMN 
AND NOW THE POOR MAN'S DEAD HE'S ALL OVER HIM 
AND ULTIMATELY ELEVATED HIM IF I MAY USE THE TERM WITHOUT ANY IRONY 
TO ONE OF THE GIANTS OF POST WAR COMEDY 
I DON'T KNOW THE WAY WE ALWAYS RUSH TO EMBRACE THE DEAD IS ALL VERY WELL 
BUT HOW ABOUT A BIT MORE AFFECTION WHILE THEY'RE ALIVE 
SORRY ARE YOU ON YOUR OWN IT'S JUST 
I THINK WE NEED TO TALK 
WHEN YOU SAY IT'S NOT WORKING 
I MEAN THE TWO OF US BEING APART 
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW IT DON'T WE 
DEEP DOWN 
THIS BREAK UP JUST ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE 
YOU KNOW 
AND I REALLY HAVE TRIED I SWEAR TO MAKE A GO OF IT 
BUT I JUST THINK THERE COMES A POINT 
WHEN WE HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST WITH EACH OTHER 
AND JUST FACE UP TO THE FACT 
IT'S TIME TO GET BACK TOGETHER 
SO DEAD BUT HE WON'T LIE DOWN THEN 
WELL HE'S CERTAINLY NOT MAKING IT EASY FOR ME 
I'M OBVIOUSLY GONNA HAVE TO TRY AND LIE LOW FOR A WHILE 
BUT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY 
I HAVE NOT YET SEEN THE LAST OF DOUGLAS MCVITIE BY A LONG WAY 
ANYWAY THE PAIR OF YOU I'M HOPING 
HAVE NOW SETTLED ALL YOUR DIFFERENCES FROM THE OTHER DAY 
ALL THAT NONSENSE ABOUT SHOP SOILED MERCHANDISE 
YEAH I KNOW 
COS I'VE GOTTA STOP READING SO MUCH INTO THINGS ALL THE WHILE 
AND JUST TRY AND BE A BIT MORE TRUSTING AND TOLERANT 
HIYA BABE 
HI GORGEOUS 
OH LISTEN CLEO HAVE YOU GOT A SPARE HAND FOR A SEC 
FOR YOU YEAH SURE 
I AM MISTRESS OF ALL I SURVEY 
YOU THREW YOUR LIFE AWAY BECAUSE HE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND YOUR CLEVER WORDS AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE 
MY CLEVER WORDS WILL SOON BE THE ONLY THING PUTTING A ROOF OVER MY HEAD 
WHAT HAPPINESS I AM ALL ALONE 
OUT OF STEP AND AHEAD OF HER TIME 
THE ONLY WAY TO GET A MAN LIKE MR. DARCY IS TO MAKE HIM UP 
THE UNTOLD STORY OF A GREAT STORYTELLER
