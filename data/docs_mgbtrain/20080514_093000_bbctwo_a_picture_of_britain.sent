FOR OUR GREATEST ARTISTS WRITERS AND COMPOSERS 
I'M TRAVELLING IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS 
TO SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACES IN THESE ISLANDS 
IN SCOTLAND AND IRELAND 
WE'LL EXPLORE THE MOUNTAIN GLENS 
BACKDROP TO SCOTLAND'S VIOLENT HISTORY 
LOCHS SHROUDED IN MIST 
ENCIRCLED BY FORESTS 
GREEN PASTURES 
AND CRAGGY PEAKS 
PLACES OF MYSTERY AND LEGEND 
AND ON UP INTO THE HIGHLANDS 
IT'S ONLY IN THE LAST THREE HUNDRED YEARS THAT LANDSCAPES LIKE THIS 
HAVE BEEN REALLY APPRECIATED FOR THEIR NATURAL BEAUTY 
AND DURING THOSE THREE HUNDRED YEARS 
IRELAND AND SCOTLAND HAVE HAD A VERY TROUBLED RELATIONSHIP WITH ENGLAND 
BUT ARTISTS WRITERS COMPOSERS HAVE USED THIS LANDSCAPE 
TO CREATE A SENSE OF NATIONAL IDENTITY FOR THEIR TWO COUNTRIES 
AND TO IMPOSE THAT IMAGE ON THE REST OF THE WORLD 
MY JOURNEY BEGINS IN EDINBURGH 
ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST HANDSOME CITIES 
SET IN A LANDSCAPE OF HILLS AND CRAGS 
FOR MY MONEY THIS IS THE FINEST VIEW OF EDINBURGH FROM CALTON HILL 
YOU SEE IT IN ITS NATURAL SETTING 
YOU SEE THE OLD TOWN HUDDLED ROUND THE CASTLE 
AND THE NEW TOWN DOWN HERE 
IT WAS HERE IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THAT A PAINTER CALLED ALEXANDER NASMYTH CAME 
AND HE SAW ALL THE NEW BUILDING GOING ON HERE HIS CITY BEING TRANSFORMED 
AND HE PAINTED A VISION OF THE EDINBURGH OF THE FUTURE 
AND INDEED THE SCOTLAND OF THE FUTURE EDINBURGH FROM CALTON HILL 
THIS IS A CELEBRATION OF PROGRESS 
THE UNION OF ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVEN 
HAD UNLEASHED A NEW ENERGY IN THE SCOTTISH CAPITAL 
FINE BUILDINGS WERE SPRINGING UP 
THE CITY WAS BOOMING 
THE DYNAMIC NEW TOWN DOMINATES THE PAINTING 
THIS IS A VISION OF A COUNTRY THAT'S FORWARD LOOKING AND MODERN 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME 
A DIFFERENT VISION OF SCOTLAND WAS BEING FORGED 
ROMANTIC AND NOSTALGIC 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY TWO GEORGE THE FOURTH BECAME THE FIRST REIGNING MONARCH 
TO VISIT SCOTLAND SINCE UNION 
AND WHEN HE ARRIVED HERE IN EDINBURGH 
THESE STREETS WERE LINED WITH HIGHLANDERS 
ALL DRESSED IN TARTAN WIELDING AXES AND PISTOLS AND SWORDS 
AND PLAYING THE BAGPIPES AND FOR THE FIFTEEN DAYS THAT HE WAS HERE 
THESE STREETS WERE TRANSFORMED INTO A HIGHLAND FANTASY 
THE PAINTER SIR DAVID WILKIE 
CAPTURED THE KING'S VISIT FOR POSTERITY 
BUT IT WAS A WRITER 
WHO HAD STAGE MANAGED THIS GATHERING OF THE HIGHLAND CLANS 
THE POPULAR AUTHOR SIR WALTER SCOTT 
SCOTT BELIEVED IN THE UNION WITH ENGLAND 
BUT HE KNEW THAT IT WAS A TROUBLED MARRIAGE 
MANY OF HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN SUSPECTED AN ENGLISH TAKE OVER 
WOULD DESTROY THEIR CULTURE 
AND THE ENGLISH ALWAYS FEARED A SCOTTISH REBELLION 
WALTER SCOTT'S MASTERSTROKE WAS TO KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE 
ON THE ONE HAND HE WAS SAYING TO THE SCOTS DON'T WORRY YOUR IDENTITY IS SAFE INTACT 
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU'VE GOT TO ACCEPT THIS MAN AS YOUR REIGNING MONARCH 
OR AS HE PUT IT WE ARE THE CLAN HE'S THE CHIEF 
GEORGE THE FOURTH LOVED IT HE EVEN AGREED TO APPEAR IN PUBLIC 
WEARING A RATHER SHORT KILT AND FLESH COLOURED TIGHTS 
I SUPPOSE TO HIDE HIS KNOBBLY KNEES 
SIR WALTER SCOTT'S MASTERPIECE OF STREET THEATRE 
ASTONISHED MANY SCOTS 
MOST OF WHOM HAD NO CONNECTION 
WITH THE HIGHLANDS 
BUT THANKS TO SCOTT 
THEY'VE BEEN SADDLED WITH THE IMAGE OF THE HIGHLANDER EVER SINCE 
AND THE NEW SCOTTISH STYLE WOULD BECOME ALL THE RAGE 
CLAN CHIEFTAINS QUEUED UP TO BE PAINTED IN FULL HIGHLAND DRESS 
HOW MANY TARTANS ARE THERE NOW HOW MANY DIFFERENT PATTERNS 
THERE'S THREE THOUSAND TO FOUR THOUSAND DIFFERENT TARTANS 
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN TARTAN IF YOU WANT I CAN 
YOU CAN MAKE A DIMBLEBY TARTAN WE CAN DESIGN ONE FOR YOU YES 
A UNIQUE DIMBLEBY TARTAN NO PROBLEM HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT 
YOU WOULD TELL US WHAT KIND OF COLOURS YOU WOULD LIKE 
AND WE COULD DESIGN IT FOR YOU AT A FAIR PRICE OF COURSE 
IF I WORE A DIMBLEBY TARTAN IN THE STREETS OF EDINBURGH 
I'D BE HUNG DRAWN AND QUARTERED NOT AT ALL 
WHAT'S HE DOING DRESSED UP LIKE A SCOTSMAN 
ANYBODY CAN WEAR TARTAN NOWADAYS 
THREE 
TWO 
ONE 
I'M LEAVING THE CITY DRIVING NORTH INTO THE TROSSACHS 
A GAELIC WORD WHICH MEANS BRISTLY COUNTRY 
THESE DENSE FORESTS ARE THE GATEWAY TO THE HIGHLANDS 
LOCH LOMOND 
THESE ARE THE LEGENDARY BONNIE BONNIE BANKS OF LOCH LOMOND 
STRETCHING TWENTY THREE MILES NORTH TO SOUTH 
THE LONGEST STRETCH OF FRESH WATER IN THE BRITISH ISLES 
AND OF COURSE IMMORTALISED IN THE FAMOUS SONG 
WRITTEN BY A HIGHLANDER AWAITING EXECUTION 
WHO'S SPECULATING ON WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIS SPIRIT 
COMPARING IT TO A FELLOW PRISONER WHO DOESN'T FACE EXECUTION 
OH YE'LL TAKE THE HIGH ROAD AND I'LL TAKE THE LOW 
AND I'LL BE IN SCOTLAND AFORE YE 
BUT ME AND MY TRUE LOVE WILL NEVER MEET AGAIN 
ON THE BONNIE BONNIE BANKS OF LOCH LOMOND 
I HAD A SCOTTISH MUSIC TEACHER AND I THINK SHE'LL BE TURNING IN HER GRAVE 
FROM THE MOMENT WALTER SCOTT FIRST CAME HERE AS A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD 
HE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE HIGHLANDS 
THE LANDSCAPE WOULD INSPIRE SOME OF HIS MOST POPULAR NOVELS 
LIKE WAVERLEY AND ROB ROY 
IN ROB ROY WALTER SCOTT DESCRIBED LOCH LOMOND 
AS ONE OF THE MOST SURPRISING BEAUTIFUL AND SUBLIME SPECTACLES IN NATURE 
BUT IT WASN'T JUST THE EXTREME BEAUTY OF THIS MAGICAL SPOT THAT APPEALED TO HIM 
IT WAS ALSO ITS HISTORY HE WROTE 
EVERY VALLEY HAS ITS BATTLE AND EVERY STREAM ITS SONG 
IT WAS AS THOUGH FOR HIM THE VERY ROCKS CONTAINED THE HISTORY OF SCOTLAND 
SIR WALTER SCOTT WAS A PUBLISHING SENSATION 
HE SET UP HIS OWN PRINTING BUSINESS 
AND HIS NOVELS AND POEMS ABOUT THE HIGHLANDS 
WERE BEST SELLERS ALL OVER THE WORLD 
TRAVELLERS HAD ALWAYS AVOIDED THIS PLACE 
BELIEVING IT TO BE WILD AND DANGEROUS 
NOW THEY WANTED TO SEE IT FOR THEMSELVES 
SIR WALTER SCOTT CALLED THIS THE LAND OF THE MOUNTAIN AND THE FLOOD 
AND VISITORS FLOCKED TO SEE PLACES HE'D VIVIDLY DESCRIBED 
CLUTCHING COPIES OF HIS BOOKS 
KEEN TO FOLLOW IN THE STEPS OF ROB ROY 
WHAT WALTER SCOTT HAD DONE 
WAS TO JUMP START THE SCOTTISH TOURIST INDUSTRY 
THANK YOU 
HELLO HOW DO YOU DO YOU LOOK SMALLER THAN YOU USUALLY DO 
I LOOK SMALLER IN REAL LIFE YOU DO ARE YOU ONE OF THE DIMBLEBY BOYS I AM YEAH IT'S RICHARD 
DAVID I AM HELLO HOW DO YOU DO 
TELL ME WHAT YOU LIKE ABOUT IT UP HERE 
OH IT'S THE SCENERY ISN'T IT YEAH IT'S REALLY REALLY FRESH 
IT'S LOVELY THE COUNTRYSIDE AND THE VIEWS 
IT'S SO NICE AND FRESH UP HERE LOVELY AND FRESH AIR 
HOW DO YOU FIND THE PEOPLE OH THEY'RE FINE FINE YEAH 
CAN'T UNDERSTAND A LOT THAT THEY SAY MIND BUT APART FROM THAT FINE 
SIR WALTER SCOTT WAS RATHER ALARMED 
BY THE ARRIVAL OF HIS DEDICATED FANS UP HERE 
HE WROTE EXASPERATEDLY THAT EVERY LONDON CITIZEN MAKES LOCH LOMOND HIS WASH POT 
AND THROWS HIS SHOE OVER BEN NEVIS 
BUT IT WASN'T THE LEAST OF HIS PROBLEMS IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THERE WAS A STOCK MARKET CRASH 
AND SCOTT'S PRINTING BUSINESS WENT BUST 
HE PROMISED TO PAY OFF ALL THE DEBTS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND THAT'S ABOUT FIVE MILLION BY TODAY'S MONEY 
AND SO FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE EVERYTHING HE WROTE WAS USED TO PAY OFF HIS CREDITORS 
HE DIED PENNILESS IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY TWO 
SIR WALTER SCOTT HAD IGNITED A LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE HIGHLANDS 
ARTISTS FROM THE INDUSTRIAL LOWLANDS FOLLOWED HIM LOOKING FOR INSPIRATION 
ONE OF THEM EMERGED AS ONE OF SCOTLAND'S GREATEST PAINTERS 
HORATIO MCCULLOCH 
HE EMBRACED THE NEW PASSION FOR THIS PART OF SCOTLAND 
CALLING ONE OF HIS PAINTINGS MY HEART'S IN THE HIGHLANDS 
AND A PIECE OF MUSIC WRITTEN BY A YOUNG COMPOSER FROM GLASGOW 
CAPTURED THE ROMANCE OF THIS LANDSCAPE 
HIS NAME WAS HAMISH MACCUNN 
BORN IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT MACCUNN WAS A CHILD PRODIGY 
HE WAS COMPOSING BY THE AGE OF FIVE AND HE WROTE THIS PIECE WHEN HE WAS JUST NINETEEN 
THE OVERTURE BROUGHT HAMISH MACCUNN INSTANT SUCCESS AND LASTING FAME 
WHEN FIRST PERFORMED IN LONDON IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THE PLAYWRIGHT AND MUSIC CRITIC GEORGE BERNARD SHAW SAID OF IT 
IT WAS A CHARMING SCOTCH OVERTURE THAT CARRIES YOU OVER THE HILL AND FAR AWAY 
AND HAMISH WAS SOON BEING ACCLAIMED AS SCOTLAND'S NATIONAL COMPOSER 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE BEST THING ABOUT TRAVELLING IN SCOTLAND IS KIPPERS FOR BREAKFAST 
I HAVE THEM EVERY MORNING AND RATE THEM NOUGHT TO FIVE I THINK THIS IS HEADING TOWARDS A FOUR 
DELICIOUS AND OF COURSE BREAD AND MARMALADE TO GO WITH IT 
INDISPENSABLE 
I'M DRIVING THROUGH THE NORTH EASTERN HIGHLANDS 
SOME OF THE WILDEST AND MOST UNSPOILT LANDSCAPE IN THE COUNTRY 
A YOUNG ARTIST CAME HERE IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY TWO AND STARTED A LOVE AFFAIR 
THAT WOULD LAST A LIFETIME 
HER NAME WAS QUEEN VICTORIA 
QUEEN VICTORIA MADE HUNDREDS OF SKETCHES AND WATERCOLOURS OF THE LANDSCAPE 
THIS WAS THE YOUNG QUEEN'S ESCAPE 
SHE WROTE IN HER DIARY ALL SEEMED TO BREATHE FREEDOM AND PEACE 
AND TO MAKE ONE FORGET THE WORLD AND ITS SAD TURMOILS 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT VICTORIA BUILT A CASTLE AT BALMORAL 
IN SCOTTISH BARONIAL STYLE 
COMPLETE WITH TURRETS 
WHEN VICTORIA WAS UP HERE SHE ADOPTED WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF AS THE PROPER SCOTTISH LIFESTYLE 
SHE HAD SCOTS OATS FOR BREAKFAST PIPERS GOING ROUND THE DINING ROOM 
SHE GOT PRINCE ALBERT TO DESIGN A SPECIAL BALMORAL TARTAN 
BALMORAL TARTAN FOR THE CURTAINS FOR THE CHAIRS FOR THE CARPETS 
IT'S SAID THAT WHEN SHE WAS UP HERE SHE SPOKE WITH A SCOTTISH ACCENT 
CAN'T BELIEVE THAT FOOLED ANYONE 
VICTORIA'S PRESENCE AT BALMORAL MADE THE HIGHLANDS FASHIONABLE 
WEALTHY TOURISTS CAME TO ENJOY THE PLEASURES OF THE SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE 
DEERSTALKING INSPIRED ONE OF THE MOST ROMANTIC VISIONS OF SCOTLAND 
THE MOST FAMOUS PAINTING TO COME OUT OF THE HIGHLANDS 
PROUD AND DEFIANT THE NOBLE STAG DOMINATES THE LANDSCAPE 
SIR EDWIN LANDSEER WAS QUEEN VICTORIA'S FAVOURITE ARTIST 
LANDSEER WAS A REGULAR MAN ABOUT TOWN 
HE WAS A WIT A MIMIC A BIT OF A DANDY 
WHEN HIS FELLOW ARTIST THE LANDSCAPE ARTIST JOHN CONSTABLE SAW HIM AT AN OFFICIAL DINNER 
HE SAID THAT THE FRILLS ON HIS SHIRT STRETCHED FROM HIS SHIRT TO HIS NAVEL 
AND HIS HAIR WAS A MASS OF A BEAUTIFUL THOUSAND CURLS 
LANDSEER BECAME VERY QUICKLY THE RICHEST ARTIST WORKING IN BRITAIN 
AND ALL BY FULFILLING A PARTICULAR KIND OF VICTORIAN TASTE 
LANDSEER BEGAN DRAWING ANIMALS WHEN HE WAS FOUR YEARS OLD 
HE SOON REALISED THAT A WEALTHY MAN WOULD PAY MORE FOR A PORTRAIT OF HIS DOG THAN OF HIS WIFE 
AND SO HE CORNERED THE MARKET IN ANIMAL PORTRAITS 
THIS IS QUEEN VICTORIA'S FAVOURITE DOG 
AND LANDSEER OFTEN JOINED IN ROYAL HUNTING PARTIES AT BALMORAL 
WHEN HE WAS IN THE HIGHLANDS LANDSEER WAS AN AVID STALKER 
WHO DOES NOT GLORY IN THE DEATH OF A FINE STAG HE SAID 
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT ALL THE TOIL AND TROUBLE WILD WEATHER 
THE SAVAGE SCENERY THAT MAKES BUTCHERS OF US ALL 
THE ONLY THING IS HE WAS RATHER A POOR SHOT AND HE COULDN'T DECIDE WHETHER TO SHOOT OR DRAW THE STAG 
TO THE CONSTERNATION OF HIS FELLOW SHOOTERS SOMETIMES ONCE HE'D GOT A STAG IN HIS SIGHTS 
HE'D HAND THEM THE GUN AND TAKE OUT HIS SKETCH BOOK 
PETER YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL AT THIS BUSINESS OF STALKING 
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HAVE TO DO 
WELL FIRST OF ALL YOU'RE DEALING WITH A VERY INTELLIGENT ANIMAL 
HE'S GOT FIRST CLASS EYESIGHT GREAT SENSE OF SMELL AND GOOD HEARING 
SO TO OUTWIT HIM YOU MUST BE THAT ONE LITTLE BIT SMARTER THAN HE IS 
WHAT'S THE SECRET OF A SUCCESSFUL STALK THE MAIN IDEA 
IS TO KEEP OUT OF SIGHT OF THAT DEER FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE 
IF YOU BREAK THE SKYLINE THEY'LL TWIG YOU RIGHT AWAY 
SO IT'S ESSENTIAL YOU STAY OUT OF SIGHT FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE 
DO YOU WALK OR CRAWL ALL THE TIME WE WALK TILL WE COME IN VIEW OF HIM 
BUT WE DO TRY TO WALK AS CLOSE AS WE CAN 
AND THEN WHEN WE CAN GO NO FURTHER THEN WE'VE TO GO AND CRAWL 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU COULD DO IF YOU HAD HAY FEVER IS IT OH NO 
WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY I WOULD THINK SNEEZE AT THE LAST MOMENT 
I'M HEADING ACROSS TO THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE HIGHLANDS 
ON MY WAY TO ONE OF THE MOST HAUNTING PLACES IN SCOTLAND 
GLENCOE 
FOR FIVE HUNDRED YEARS THIS WAS HOME TO THE MACDONALD CLAN 
BUT IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETY TWO 
THEY WERE THE VICTIMS OF ONE OF THE MOST VIOLENT ACTS IN SCOTTISH HISTORY 
FEARING AN UPRISING THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT HAD DECIDED TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF THEM 
THEY SENT TO GLENCOE MEMBERS OF THE CAMPBELL CLAN KNOWN FOR THEIR LOYALTY TO THE ENGLISH 
THE MACDONALDS WELCOMED THEM INTO THEIR HOMES AND ENTERTAINED THEM FOR TEN DAYS 
ON THE TWELFTH OF FEBRUARY THE CAMPBELLS RECEIVED ORDERS THAT THE FOLLOWING MORNING AT FIVE O'CLOCK 
THEY WERE TO SLAUGHTER EVERY MACDONALD UNDER THE AGE OF SEVENTY 
IT WAS TO BE SECRET AND SUDDEN 
A BEACON WAS LIT ON THIS HILL AS A SIGNAL FOR THE MASSACRE TO START 
IN A BLINDING SNOWSTORM THEY SET OFF AFTER THEIR HOSTS STILL MANY OF THEM SLUMBERING IN THEIR BEDS 
AND STARTED KILLING THEM KILLING IN ALL THIRTY EIGHT IT WAS AN ACT OF TREACHERY A BETRAYAL 
OF EVERYTHING THE CLAN SYSTEM WAS MEANT TO STAND FOR 
IT'S QUITE APPROPRIATE THAT GLENCOE IN GAELIC MEANS VALLEY OF WEEPING 
NEARLY TWO HUNDRED YEARS LATER THE ARTIST JAMES HAMILTON PAINTED 
DISTRAUGHT MACDONALD SURVIVORS 
BUT HORATIO MCCULLOCH HAD A DIFFERENT VISION IN HIS PICTURE 
THE LANDSCAPE STANDS AS A MEMORIAL TO THAT TERRIBLE DAY 
A STORM HAS JUST PASSED AND THE DARK CLOUDS ARE ROLLING AWAY ACROSS THE SKY 
THE ONLY SIGN OF LIFE IS A SMALL HERD OF DEER 
STANDING IN THE SHADOWS DWARFED BY THE MOUNTAINS ABOVE 
THE EMPTINESS OF THE GLEN 
IS A REMINDER THAT THIS IS A SCENE OF TRAGEDY 
AND LOST LIVES 
YOU'RE A MACDONALD I'M A MACDONALD YES 
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE MASSACRE TAKING PLACE IN THIS SCENERY 
YES I CAN IMAGINE IT YES IT'S NOT HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED 
IT'S QUITE A FRIGHTENING PLACE 
AT TIMES 
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HAUNTED YOU DO HEAR SOUNDS THAT YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN 
IS THERE STILL BAD FEELING BETWEEN MACDONALD AND CAMPBELL 
THE HIGHLANDER ISN'T LIKE THAT HE DOESN'T CARRY A GRUDGE 
THAT'S THE WAY WE ARE WE CAN FORGIVE WE DON'T FORGET THOUGH 
WHEN THE FIRST ENGLISH TOURISTS BEGAN COMING HERE 
THEY WERE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED TO FIND THERE WERE GOOD ROADS IN SCOTLAND 
THE ENGLISH ARMY HAD HAD THEM BUILT NOWADAYS WE'RE RATHER MORE IMPATIENT 
AND ALTHOUGH AS THE CROW FLIES THE DISTANCES IN SCOTLAND ARE NOT ALL THAT GREAT 
THE ROADS OF COURSE HAVE TO GO ROUND THE MOUNTAINS AND LOCHS SO TRAVELLING TAKES A GOOD DEAL LONGER 
BUT THE NICE THING IS THERE ARE ALWAYS TREATS ALONG THE WAY 
AND HERE'S ONE OF THEM 
HELLO HELLO CAN I HAVE SOME OYSTERS CERTAINLY 
DELICIOUS THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
I HAD LOCH FYNE OYSTERS WHEN THE THING FIRST BEGAN HOW MANY YEARS AGO WAS THAT 
THE COMPANY STARTED ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO 
THEY'RE MEANT TO BE VERY GOOD FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS OYSTERS THEY ARE 
WHAT KIND OF THINGS ARE THEY MEANT TO BE GOOD FOR THEY SAY THEY'RE AN APHRODISIAC REALLY YES 
HOW MANY DO YOU EAT IN A DAY OH I DON'T EAT VERY MANY 
DELICIOUS 
MM LOVELY WOULD YOU LIKE ANOTHER ONE PLEASE 
I'D BETTER PAY YOU 
I'M DRIVING INTO KINTYRE A LONG PENINSULA ON THE WEST COAT OF SCOTLAND 
KINTYRE IS ANOTHER GAELIC WORD IT MEANS LAND'S END 
THE HISTORY OF KINTYRE WAS SHAPED BY A GREAT INJUSTICE 
THE HIGHLANDERS SUFFERED IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
LANDOWNERS REALISED THAT THEY COULD MAKE GOOD MONEY OUT OF SHEEP FARMING ON A LARGE SCALE 
OR FROM LEASING THEIR ESTATES FOR FISHING OR SHOOTING OR STALKING 
AS A RESULT THEY DECIDED TO DRIVE THE HIGHLANDERS OFF THEIR LAND 
IT WAS CALLED THE CLEARANCES 
IT LASTED FIFTY YEARS AND THE EFFECTS WERE DEVASTATING 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES WERE DRIVEN OUT OF THEIR HOMES 
SOME WENT DOWN TO THE COAST AND TRIED TO MAKE A LIVING FROM FISHING 
OTHERS LEFT SCOTLAND ALTOGETHER EMIGRATING TO ENGLAND OR IRELAND OR TO AMERICA 
ARTISTS IMMORTALISED THE HIGHLAND CLEARANCES 
AN ELDERLY CLANSMAN TOO FRAIL TO TRAVEL IS LEFT AT THE QUAYSIDE 
AS HIS FAMILY PREPARES TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY 
IN ANOTHER PICTURE A COUPLE SAIL FOR THEIR NEW LIFE ABROAD 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FIVE AN ARTIST CALLED WILLIAM MCTAGGART 
BORN IN KINTYRE PAINTED HIS OWN RESPONSE TO THE CLEARANCES 
IT'S A SOMBRE SEASCAPE 
SHOWING A BOAT SAILING AWAY FROM THE SCOTTISH COAST 
CARRYING ITS HUMAN CARGO OF HOMELESS HIGHLANDERS FORCED OFF THEIR LAND 
WILLIAM MCTAGGART MADE A LIVING FOR HIMSELF AS A PAINTER FROM THE AGE OF SIXTEEN 
PAINTING PORTRAITS IN EDINBURGH 
BUT HE WAS ALWAYS DRAWN TO THIS LANDSCAPE 
MCTAGGART WOULD COME BACK TO KINTYRE EVERY SUMMER TO PAINT 
HE PAINTED IN OILS ON CANVAS AND QUITE LARGE CANVASES 
WHICH HE'D SET UP HERE ON MACHRIHANISH BEACH 
HE'D EITHER PROP THEM UP AGAINST THE ROCKS OR USE ROPES OR STONES 
OR EVEN HAVE HIS SON HEROICALLY HOLDING THE CANVAS AGAINST THE WIND 
WHILE HE PAINTED AWAY ON THE BEACH LIKE THIS 
IT WAS UNHEARD OF TO PAINT IN THE OPEN AIR ON THIS SCALE AT THAT TIME 
AND PARTICULARLY UNDER THESE UNPREDICTABLE SCOTTISH SKIES 
BORN INTO A GAELIC SPEAKING CROFTING FAMILY 
MCTAGGART UNDERSTOOD HOW HARD IT WAS TO MAKE A LIVING HERE IN KINTYRE 
IN HIS PAINTING THE STORM 
A RESCUE SHIP IS LAUNCHED TO SAVE A FISHING BOAT THAT'S BEING SWEPT TOWARDS THE ROCKS 
A CROWD LOOKS ON SHELTERING FROM THE ELEMENTS 
MCTAGGART PAINTS THE PEOPLE AS TINY VULNERABLE FIGURES 
AT THE MERCY OF THE STORM 
MCTAGGART'S WORK IS FAR REMOVED FROM THE HIGHLAND IDYLL OF LANDSEER OR MCCULLOCH 
HE ONCE SAID IT'S NOT GRAND SCENERY THAT MAKES A FINE LANDSCAPE 
HUMANITY IS THE THING 
A FEW MILES SOUTH OF MACHRIHANISH WHERE MCTAGGART DID MOST OF HIS WORK 
IS THE MULL OF KINTYRE THE SOUTHERNMOST POINT OF THE PENINSULA 
AND THE NEAREST THAT SCOTLAND GETS TO IRELAND ONLY TWELVE MILES AWAY 
SO CLOSE THAT ON A CLEAR DAY YOU CAN ALMOST REACH OUT AND TOUCH IT 
BOTH SCOTLAND AND IRELAND RESPONDED TO ENGLAND'S ATTEMPT TO CREATE 
THIS UNITED KINGDOM BY IN THEIR OWN WAYS FOCUSING ON THEIR SENSE OF NATIONAL IDENTITY AND NATIONAL PRIDE 
IN SCOTLAND IT TOOK THE FORM OF A FLOWERING OF SCOTTISH CULTURE 
THE SAME THING HAPPENED IN IRELAND 
EXCEPT THERE IT NURTURED A STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE WHICH LED TO BLOODSHED 
THE PEACEFUL LANDSCAPE OF IRELAND MASKS A HISTORY OF TURBULENCE 
THE REVIVAL OF IRISH ART AND CULTURE AND POLITICS 
HAD ITS ROOTS HERE IN THE LANDSCAPE OF CO SLIGO IN THE WEST OF IRELAND 
IN THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTIES THIS PLACE WAS AN INSPIRATION TO A BOY WHO CAME HERE ON HOLIDAY EACH SUMMER 
WITH HIS FAMILY 
HIS NAME WAS WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS 
AND HE GREW UP TO BE IRELAND'S NATIONAL POET 
YEATS WAS TO BECOME A PASSIONATE NATIONALIST 
AND IT WAS HIS CHILDHOOD HERE IN SLIGO THAT INSTILLED IN HIM A LOVE OF HIS HOME COUNTRY 
HE WROTE THAT WHEN HE WAS LIVING IN LONDON HE WAS SO IN LOVE WITH THE FIELDS AND ROADS OF SLIGO 
THAT HE LONGED FOR EARTH FROM A ROAD THAT HE MIGHT KISS IT 
YEATS WAS A ROMANTIC 
HE DREAMT OF LIVING HERE THE ISLAND OF INNISFREE IN THE MIDDLE OF LOUGH GILL 
YEATS WAS ENTRANCED BY THIS PLACE 
AS A BOY HE SPENT A NIGHT ON THE SHORE OF THE LOUGH 
TO SEE THE ISLAND AT SUNRISE 
AND HE ALWAYS KEPT THE MEMORY OF IT IN HIS HEART 
MANY YEARS LATER HE WAS WALKING DOWN FLEET STREET IN LONDON 
WHEN HE SAW A FOUNTAIN AND IT REMINDED HIM OF INNISFREE 
AND HE WENT BACK HOME AND WROTE PERHAPS ONE OF HIS MOST FAMOUS POEMS THE LAKE ISLE OF INNISFREE 
I WILL ARISE AND GO NOW AND GO TO INNISFREE 
AND A SMALL CABIN BUILD THERE OF CLAY AND WATTLES MADE 
NINE BEAN ROWS WILL I HAVE THERE AND A HIVE FOR THE HONEY BEE 
AND LIVE ALONE IN THE BEE LOUD GLADE 
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D EVER SEE THIS PLACE 
I LEARNED THE POEM WHEN I WAS A CHILD 
AND I REMEMBER BEING VERY PUZZLED BY THE NINE BEAN ROWS AND THE HIVE FOR THE HONEY BEE 
BUT THE LINES THAT REALLY CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WAS AND I SHALL HAVE SOME PEACE THERE 
FOR PEACE COMES DROPPING SLOW 
DROPPING FROM THE VEILS OF THE MORNING TO WHERE THE CRICKET SINGS 
THERE MIDNIGHT'S ALL A GLIMMER AND NOON A PURPLE GLOW 
AND THE EVENING FULL OF THE LINNET'S WINGS 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL 
AND IT TOUCHED ME SOMEHOW I DON'T KNOW 
IN THE SORT OF TURBULENT TIMES OF ONE'S YOUTH 
IT RESTORED A KIND OF CALM 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE WHEN HE WAS TWENTY THREE 
YEATS MET AND FELL IN LOVE WITH A STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL ACTRESS 
WITH LARGE LUMINOUS EYES CALLED MAUD GONNE 
SHE BECAME THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE 
SHE EMBODIED EVERYTHING THAT HE LOVED ABOUT IRELAND 
HE SAID THAT HER BEAUTY WAS LIKE SOMETHING THAT CAME OUT OF PICTURES OR POETRY 
AND HER STATURE SO GREAT SHE SEEMED TO BELONG TO A DIVINE RACE 
MAUD GONNE WAS A FOUNDING MEMBER OF SINN FEIN 
EAGER TO IMPRESS HER YEATS JOINED THE SECRET IRISH REPUBLICAN BROTHERHOOD 
AN ORGANISATION PLANNING TO USE VIOLENCE TO OVERTHROW BRITISH RULE 
ON TWENTY FOURTH APRIL EASTER MONDAY NINETEEN SIXTEEN 
THE REVOLUTIONARIES ROSE AGAINST THE BRITISH IN DUBLIN 
A TURNING POINT IN IRISH HISTORY 
WITHIN FIVE DAYS THE UPRISING WAS CRUSHED 
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE DIED AND TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WERE INJURED 
THE RINGLEADERS WERE EXECUTED BECOMING MARTYRS TO THE IRISH CAUSE 
YEATS WAS MOVED TO WRITE ONE OF HIS MOST IMPASSIONED POEMS EASTER NINETEEN SIXTEEN 
WHICH ENDS WITH THE LINE 
ALL CHANGED CHANGED UTTERLY A TERRIBLE BEAUTY IS BORN 
AFTER THE EASTER RISING THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE INTENSIFIED 
YEATS' DREAM OF A FREE IRELAND SEEMED TO BE COMING TRUE 
EVEN AS HIS PASSION FOR MAUD GONNE WAS THWARTED 
MAUD NEVER RETURNED YEATS'S LOVE 
BUT HE REMAINED BESOTTED BY HER ALL HIS LIFE 
MANY YEARS LATER SHE WAS ASKED IF SHE DIDN'T FEEL ANY GUILT AT THIS REJECTION 
AND SHE REPLIED COOLLY IF I HAD RETURNED HIS FEELINGS 
THE WORLD WOULD HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF HIS BEAUTIFUL POETRY 
AT THE START OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
W. B. YEATS ISSUED A CALL TO IRISH ARTISTS 
TO COME BACK TO IRELAND AND MAKE IT THE SUBJECT OF THEIR WORK 
AND ONE PERSON WHO DID THIS WAS PAUL HENRY 
HE'D ACTUALLY BEEN BROUGHT UP A PROTESTANT IN THE NORTH 
IN A RATHER CLAUSTROPHOBIC RELIGIOUS ATMOSPHERE 
AND HE'D GONE TO PARIS TO PAINT TO ESCAPE IT 
AND THEN HE CHOSE TO COME BACK HERE 
IT WAS A DECISIVE MOMENT IN HIS CAREER 
IN AUGUST NINETEEN TEN HENRY ARRIVED WITH HIS WIFE GRACE HERE IN ACHILL 
A BARREN WINDSWEPT ISLAND JUST OFF THE WEST COAST OF IRELAND 
HE USED THIS LANDSCAPE TO CHANGE THE WAY WE SEE IRELAND 
THE HENRYS CAME HERE FOR A FORTNIGHT'S HOLIDAY 
BUT THE MOMENT THEY ARRIVED PAUL SAID THAT ACHILL WAS LIKE A HOMECOMING 
IT SPOKE TO HIM AS NO PLACE BEFORE HAD 
AND WITHIN THREE DAYS HE WAS UP HERE ON THE ROCKS LOOKING OUT OVER THE SEA 
AND HE TOOK OUT HIS RETURN TICKET TO LONDON 
HE TORE IT INTO LITTLE BITS AND HE SCATTERED IT INTO THE SEA 
THEY STAYED NINE YEARS 
YOU BOTH LIVE HERE AND HE OBVIOUSLY SAW SOMETHING IN THIS PLACE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SAW IN THE PLACE 
THE SCENERY AND THE BEACHES AND THE MOUNTAINS 
ALL THAT CERTAINLY APPEALS TO ME 
I TRIED LIVING IN A CITY FOR A WHILE 
AND I MUST SAY I WAS GLAD TO GET BACK HERE 
MY FIRST TIME COMING BACK TO ACHILL 
WHEN I FIRST STARTED 
COURTING IF YOU LIKE MY PRESENT WIFE 
MY ONLY WIFE 
I CAME OVER THE HILL FROM BUNACURRY 
AND TO ME LIKE PAUL HENRY IT WAS LIKE COMING HOME AGAIN 
AND I HAVEN'T LEFT THE PLACE SINCE AND I WOULDN'T WISH TO LEAVE IT 
WHAT'S ITS SECRET 
THERE'S A MAGIC ABOUT IT 
THERE'S EVEN A WINTER MAGIC ON THOSE WILD WOOLLY DAYS 
AND ONCE YOU 
GET TO KNOW THE PLACE 
YOU WOULDN'T ASK TO LIVE ANYWHERE ELSE 
HENRY'S PAINTINGS OF ACHILL PROMOTED A NEW VISION OF THE IRISH LANDSCAPE 
ONE OF LAND SEA AND SKY 
CAPTURED IN SOFT LIGHT AND SUBTLE COLOURS 
HENRY PAINTED ALL OVER THE ISLAND 
BUT THIS WAS HIS FAVOURITE SPOT 
HE OFTEN CAME DOWN HERE AT DAWN AND YOU CAN SEE WHY 
IT'S A COMPLETELY ENTRANCING SPOT 
THESE GREAT ROCKY HILLS BUT GENTLE COLOURS GREEN AND GREY ON THEM 
THE SEA CONSTANTLY CHANGING THE WAVES ROLLING IN UP THE BEACH 
BUT ABOVE ALL I THINK IT'S THE SKY 
THE CLOUDS COMING IN FROM THE ATLANTIC 
WHICH PLAY STRANGE TRICKS ON THE LANDSCAPE 
SOMETIMES A HEADLAND IS LIT UP 
THE NEXT MOMENT CLOUD COMES DOWN AND YOU CAN'T SEE IT 
NOW IT'S THERE NOW IT'S GONE A KIND OF MAGIC 
IT'S NO WONDER THAT HE THOUGHT ACHILL REPRESENTED THE VERY SOUL OF IRELAND 
IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO MOST OF IRELAND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SIX NORTHERN COUNTIES 
WON INDEPENDENCE FROM BRITAIN 
THESE ARE THE GLENS OF ANTRIM IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
IT WAS HERE THAT AN ARTIST CALLED JAMES HUMBERT CRAIG PAINTED HIS OWN RESPONSE TO THE IRISH LANDSCAPE 
CRAIG STAYED IN THE VILLAGE OF CUSHENDUN 
HIS PAINTINGS CAPTURED DAILY LIFE IN THE NEWLY CREATED NORTHERN IRELAND 
HE WAS ALSO INSPIRED BY THE ROLLING HILLS AND THE BOLD 
EVER CHANGING SKIES OF COUNTY ANTRIM 
LIKE MANY OF HIS FELLOW ARTISTS FROM THE NORTH CRAIG CONTINUED TRAVELLING ALL OVER IRELAND 
IGNORING THE NEW LINE THAT DIVIDED THE COUNTRY IN TWO 
WHEREVER HE WENT NORTH OR SOUTH HE PAINTED THE LANDSCAPE 
IN THE THIRTY YEARS SINCE W. B. YEATS' CHALLENGE TO IRISH ARTISTS TO COME HOME 
A NEW ARTISTIC VISION OF IRELAND HAD BEEN BORN 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME 
THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE FROM BRITAIN HAD SPLIT THE COUNTRY IN TWO 
IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES AND THIRTIES THOUGH IRISH ARTISTS CELEBRATED ONE COUNTRY 
A PICTURE OF AN IRELAND WITHOUT BORDERS 
ACROSS THE SEA FROM IRELAND IS A SMALL 
UNINHABITED ROCKY OUTCROP OF THE SCOTTISH HEBRIDES 
THIS IS FINGAL'S CAVE 
A SPECTACULAR NATURAL FORMATION OF BLACK BASALT COLUMNS 
CREATED BY A SUBTERRANEAN EXPLOSION SIXTY MILLION YEARS AGO 
IT IS ASTONISHING TO SEE THIS SIGHT 
THIS MASS OF LITTLE CUBES OF ROCK AT THE BOTTOM 
THE GREAT UPRIGHT VERTICALS OF THE PILLARS AND THEN ABOVE IT 
WHAT LOOKS LIKE AN ENORMOUS SORT OF BOUFFANT HAIRSTYLE OF ROCK 
ALL WHIRLING AROUND ON TOP 
IN THE LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
FINGAL'S CAVE BECAME A FASHIONABLE BEAUTY SPOT 
IT WASN'T JUST POPULAR BECAUSE IT WAS A SPECTACULAR NATURAL PHENOMENON 
IT WAS ALSO PART OF GAELIC MYTHOLOGY 
IT WAS SAID THAT THE THIRD CENTURY IRISH HERO FINN WHO WAS A GIANT 
AND AFTER WHOM FINGAL'S CAVE IS NAMED 
BUILT A PATHWAY FROM IRELAND TO SCOTLAND WHICH CAME ASHORE HERE 
ONE OF THE CAVE'S MOST FAMOUS VISITORS WAS THE GERMAN COMPOSER 
FELIX MENDELSSOHN 
IN AUGUST ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY NINE WHEN HE WAS TWENTY 
HE SET OUT BY PADDLE STEAMER TO FINGAL'S CAVE 
MENDELSSOHN WAS VIOLENTLY SEASICK 
BUT HE WAS SO IMPRESSED BY THIS GREAT ATLANTIC SWELL ROLLING INTO FINGAL'S CAVE 
WHILE HE WAS INSIDE THE CAVE 
HE WENT BACK FROM HERE TO MULL 
HE MANAGED TO PERSUADE SOMEBODY TO LET HIM PLAY A PIANO 
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A SUNDAY AND PIANO PLAYING WAS FORBIDDEN AND THERE AND THEN WROTE DOWN THE FIRST BARS 
TWO YEARS AFTER MENDELSSOHN'S VISIT 
THE PAINTER WILLIAM TURNER ALSO MADE THE PILGRIMAGE TO FINGAL'S CAVE 
THIS IS THE PAINTING INSPIRED BY THAT EXPERIENCE 
A BLUR OF SHAPES AND COLOUR 
IT CAPTURES SOMETHING OF THE WILDNESS OF THE SEA 
THE REMOTENESS OF THE ISLAND 
TO THE RIGHT IS THE PADDLE STEAMER THAT TOOK HIM TO THE CAVE'S ENTRANCE 
TURNER'S PAINTING WAS SOLD TO AN AMERICAN 
COLONEL JAMES LENOX FOR FIVE HUNDRED 
AND WHEN LENOX GOT IT HE SAID M. M. M. IT'S INDISTINCT 
INDISTINCTNESS SAID TURNER IS MY FORTE 
JUST FIVE MILES SOUTH OF FINGAL'S CAVE IS THE TINY ISLAND OF IONA 
SAINT COLUMBA LANDED HERE FROM IRELAND IN THE SIXTH CENTURY 
BRINGING CHRISTIANITY WITH HIM 
IONA IS A TIMELESS PLACE 
WITH ONLY ONE HUNDRED INHABITANTS IT FEELS CUT OFF FROM THE WORLD 
IN NINETEEN TWELVE A PAINTER CALLED FRANCIS CADELL ARRIVED HERE FROM EDINBURGH 
IMPORTING A MODERN EXUBERANT STYLE 
IT WASN'T JUST HIS PAINTING THAT RAISED EYEBROWS 
HIS APPEARANCE ALSO CAUSED A STIR 
CADELL OR BUNTY AS HE WAS CALLED WAS A LARGER THAN LIFE CHARACTER 
HE WAS BIG ROUND ONE OF HIS FRIENDS SAID HE WAS LIKE A MARROW 
AND HE WAS BOISTEROUS TALKATIVE WITTY FLAMBOYANT 
WHEN HE CAME HERE HE USED TO WEAR A KILT 
COLOURED WAISTCOAT SILK SHIRT 
THE ISLANDERS SEEING HIM GO PAST WOULD SAY AAH HERE'S HIMSELF 
CADELL SCOURED THE ISLAND FOR VIEWS THAT CAPTURED ITS MOODS 
CLOUDS BLOW IN QUICKLY FROM THE ATLANTIC 
ALTERING THE COLOURS OF THE SAND SEA AND SKY 
CADELL LOVED THE CHANGING LIGHT AND USED BRIGHT COLOURS 
AND ROUGH BRUSHWORK TO CAPTURE WHAT HE SAW BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED 
CADELL USED TO PAINT VERY FAST IMPRESSIONISTIC BRUSHSTROKES 
HE WAS ONCE HERE PAINTING THE ABBEY 
WHEN AN ARTIST WHO'D BEEN HERE FOR SEVERAL DAYS PAINSTAKINGLY DOING HIS PAINTING SAID TO HIM 
YOU CAN'T HAVE FINISHED YET CADELL SAID YES I HAVE 
IT ONLY TOOK ME A COUPLE OF HOURS AND I'VE SOLD IT FOR ONE HUNDRED GUINEAS 
CADELL MAY HAVE PAINTED IN A MODERN STYLE 
BUT HIS WORK CONTINUED A TRADITION OF LANDSCAPE PAINTING THAT WENT BACK ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
A CELEBRATION OF SCOTLAND ROMANTIC RUGGED AND PROUD 
NO JOURNEY THROUGH SCOTLAND WILL BE COMPLETE WITHOUT A VISIT TO 
THE HOME OF A WRITER WHO AWAKENED THE PRIDE OF SCOTLAND 
OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO IN HIS FAMOUS SONG MY HEART'S IN THE HIGHLANDS 
HE WROTE WHEREVER I WANDER WHEREVER I ROVE 
THE HILLS OF THE HIGHLANDS FOREVER I LOVE 
HE WAS OF COURSE ROBBIE BURNS THE NATIONAL POET OF SCOTLAND 
BURNS WAS BORN IN THE LOWLANDS OF AYRSHIRE SOUTH WEST SCOTLAND 
THE ELDEST OF SEVEN CHILDREN 
HE GREW UP IN POVERTY IN A STRUGGLING FARMING FAMILY 
WHAT INFLUENCE DO YOU THINK BEING IMPOVERISHED IN EFFECT 
AND WORKING HARD ON THE FARM HAD ON BURNS'S OUTLOOK ON THE WORLD 
AND THE POETRY HE WROTE 
IT DEFINITELY INFLUENCED HIM IN A LOT OF HIS POETRY THAT HE WROTE 
MUCH LATER IN LIFE 
HIS POETIC GENIUS WAS JUST BUDDING WHEN HE WAS HERE 
HE WROTE HIS FIRST POEM TO NELLIE KILPATRICK 
WHO WAS TYING THE CORN TO HIM IN A FIELD 
AND SHE WAS HIS FIRST LOVE BECAUSE HE DESCRIBED HOW HE FELT 
THE BLOOD RACING PULSING THROUGH HIM WHEN HE WAS TAKING THE THISTLES OUT OF HER HAND 
HER HAND WAS FULL OF THISTLES AFTER BINDING THE CORN 
AND HE WROTE THE POEM HANDSOME NELL THAT'S HIS FIRST POEM 
A GAUDY DRESS AND GENTLE AIR MAY SLIGHTLY TOUCH THE HEART 
BUT IT'S INNOCENCE AND MODESTY THAT POLISHES THE DART 
TIS THIS IN NELLY PLEASES ME TIS THIS ENCHANTS MY SOUL 
FOR ABSOLUTELY IN MY BREAST SHE REIGNS WITHOUT CONTROL 
IT'S A DECEPTIVELY BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE LOOKING OUT ACROSS THE SEA TOWARDS THE ISLE OF ARRAN 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN HELL TO WORK THIS LAND ESPECIALLY IN BURNS'S DAY 
THICK MUD A HARD LIVING 
BUT IT GAVE HIM THE INSPIRATION FOR SOME OF HIS FINEST POETRY 
AND FOR HIS DEEP SEATED BELIEF IN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ORDINARY SCOTTISH MAN AND WOMAN 
IN ONE OF HIS LATER POEMS A MAN'S A MAN FOR A THAT 
HE WROTE A PASSIONATE DECLARATION IN FAVOUR OF THE COMMON MAN 
THE HONEST MAN THO E'ER S. A. E. POOR IS KING O' MEN FOR A THAT 
WHEN BURNS' FIRST VOLUME OF POETRY WAS PUBLISHED IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX 
HE WAS CELEBRATED AS THE PLOUGHMAN POET 
HE SET OFF ON A TOUR OF THE HIGHLANDS 
WHERE HE GATHERED TOGETHER OLD SONGS IN THE SCOTTISH DIALECT 
BURNS KNEW THEY WERE ON THE VERGE OF EXTINCTION 
SOMETIMES ONLY A FEW HALF REMEMBERED LINES REMAINED 
HE WAS DETERMINED TO SAVE THEM AND DIDN'T ACCEPT PAYMENT FOR HIS WORK 
ROBBIE BURNS DIED IN POVERTY AT THE AGE OF ONLY THIRTY SEVEN 
IN HIS SHORT LIFE HE'D DONE MORE THAN ANYONE TO REVIVE SCOTTISH CULTURE 
AMONG THE MANY SONGS HE COLLECTED WAS ONE THAT BECAME MY HEART IS IN THE HIGHLANDS 
A LOVE SONG TO THE SCOTTISH LANDSCAPE 
THE FIRST PART'S OLD HE SAID THE SECOND PART IS MINE 
WHAT HE'D DONE WAS TO FIND AN OLD GAELIC SONG AND THEN ADAPT IT 
RE WRITE IT AND GIVE IT BACK TO THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND 
MY HEART'S IN THE HIGHLANDS 
MY HEART IS NOT HERE 
MY HEART'S IN THE HIGHLANDS A CHASING THE DEER 
A CHASING THE WILD DEER AND FOLLOWING THE ROE 
MY HEART'S IN THE HIGHLANDS WHEREVER I GO

WHEN HE'LL BE EXPLORING THE FIRE AND DRAMA OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IN THE HEART OF ENGLAND
