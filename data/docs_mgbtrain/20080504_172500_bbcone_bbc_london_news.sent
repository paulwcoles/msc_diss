LESS THAN SIX HOURS TIME BORIS 
JOHNSON TAKES OVER AS MAYOR OF 
LONDON HAS ALREADY MET SENIOR 
STAFF IN TRANSPORT AND POLICE AS HE 
PREPARES TO PUT HIS MANIFESTO PLAN 
INTO ACTION MAYOR BORIS JOHNSON 
AT THIS AFTERNOON'S SIKH 
CELEBRATIONS IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE 
IT MAY BE A DRAMATIC CHANGE OF 
PERSONNEL AT THE TOP BUT IN 
REALITY THE TRANSITION IS LIKELY 
TO BE CAREFUL AND GRADUAL ONE OF 
BORIS'S IMMEDIATE TASKS IS TO 
SIGNAL HIS INTENTIONS ON THE TUBE 
WITH METRONET NOW DEFUNTH HE NEEDS 
TO PUT IN PLACE HIS PLANS FOR TAKE 
OVER THE MAINTENANCE AND UPGRADE 
WORK ONE OF HIS ELECTION PLEDGE 
WAS TO BROKER A NO STRIKE AGREEMENT 
WITH THE TUBE UNIONS SOMETHING HIS 
THINK POSSIBLE THE 
SUPPORTERS THINK POSSIBLE THE UNIONS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO 
REMEMBER IF THEY WANT TO BE 
OBSTRUCTIVE THIS IS A MAYOR WHO 
HAS THE MANDATE OF OVER ONE MILLION 
LONDONERS VOTING FOR THEM WHEN IT 
COMES TO NEGOTIATIONS HE IS IN A 
STRONG POSITION 
PHASING OUT THE BENDY BUS MAY HAVE 
BEEN ONE OF HIS MOST EYE CATCHING 
PLEDGES ACTUALLY FINDING 
DESIGNER AND A MANUFACTURER OF A 
NEW ROUTEMASTER WILL TAKE SOME TIME 
IF INDEED IT EVER HAPPENS NEW 
MAYOR WILL WANT TO CHANGE THE 
TRANSPORT BOARD AND THERE WILL BE 
SPECULATION ABOUT HOW LONG PETER 
HENDY STAYS AS TRANSPORT 
COMMISSIONER BORIS JOHNSON HAS MET 
SIR IAN BLAIR THEY SAID THE 
MEETING WAS CONSTRUCTIVE BUT SAID 
THE NEW MAYOR WOULD LOBBY FOR HIS 
DEPARTURE IF LONDONERS LOST FAITH 
IN SIR IAN BLAIR THERE WILL BE 
CHANGE IN THE WAY THAT THE MET IS 
RUN HE HAS MADE HIMSELF CHAIR OF 
THE POLICE AUTHORITY 
IT'S EASY 
DURINGING AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN TO 
SAY YOU WILL IMPROVE SERVICE AND 
YOU SAY YOU WILL CUT BUREAUCRACY 
BUT ONE OF THE CENTRAL CHALLENGES 
HE FACES IS HOW TO PAY FOR THE 
THINGS HE HAS BEEN PROMISING 
GOVERNORING IS HARDER THAN WINNING 
ELECTIONS ELECTIONS AWAITING HIS TEAM WILL BE THOSE HE 
APPOINTS AROUND HIM A SECRET 
GUARDED SO FAR HE HAS THE POWER TO 
DEVELOP THE LONDON DEVELOPMENT 
AGENCY MOST IMPORTANT WILL HE BE 
PUTTING IN PLACE TEAM OF UP TO 
DOZEN KEY ADVISORS WITH THE PROMISE 
THEIR SALARIES AND OUTSIDE 
INTERESTS ARE TRANSPARENT 
PUBLISHED ON THE GLA WEBSITE 
ALTHOUGH BORIS JOHNSON WAS SWORN IN 
YESTERDAY HE FORMALLY TAKES OVER 
POWER AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT HE KNOWS 
HIS FIRST FEW WEEKS WILL BE WATCHED 
CLOSELY MEANWHILE THE PRIME 
MINISTER HAS BEEN GIVING HIS FIRST 
REACTION TO BORIS JOHNSON BEING 
ELECTED LONDON MAYOR IN B. B. C. 
INTERVIEW HE PRAISED CLIFR'S TIME 
IN OFFICE AND GAVE A LUKEWARM

SALESMANSHIP AROUND IT'S QUITE 
SLICK AND IMPRESSIVE IN THAT BUT

LAUNCHING IT 
SPORT IN RUGBY 
UNION'S GUINNESS PREMIERSHIP SALE 
BEAT HARLEQUINS' 
LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE DRY FOR THE 
BANK HOLIDAY 
YESTERDAY LONDON WAS THE WARLEST 
SPOT IN THE COUNTRY WE DIDN'T DO 
BADLY WITH ONE OR TWO SPOTS GETTING 
INTO THE LOW TWENTIES THERE IS GOING TO 
BE A LOT OF CLOUD ACROSS OUR AREA 
BRINGING A SCATTERING OF SHOWERS 
SHOWERS WILL BE MOST FREQUENT TO 
THE WEST OF TOWN WITH ALL OF THIS 
CLOUD AROUND IT WILL BE MILD NIGHT 
TEMPERATURES FALLING NO LOW THAN ELEVEN 
OR TWELVE DEGREES TOMORROW MORNING IT 
WILL PROBABLY START OFF CLOUDY 
PROBABLY A FEW SPOTS OF RAIN FIRST 
THING WE WILL SEE THE CLOUD 
RETREATING AND WE WILL SEE SUNNY 
SPELLS DEVELOPING IN THE AFTERNOON 
ONCE AGAIN IT'S GOING TO FEEL WARM 
WITH HIGHS OF TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWO CELSIUS HOW 
ABOUT THE REST OF WEEK WITH HIGH 
PRESSURE DOMINATING IT SHOULD BE 
DRY THE FULL STORY OF BORIS 
JOHNSON'S CAMPAIGN TO BECOME MAYOR 
IS ON OUR WEBSITE WE ARE BACK 
TOMORROW MORNING DURING BREAKFAST 
FROM US ALL HERE ENJOY THE BANK 
HOLIDAY 
THE WEEK AHEAD PROMISES SOME OF THE 
DRIEST WEATHER WE HAVE SEEN FOR 
SOME TIME AND THE WARMEST SPELL OF 
THE YEAR EVEN WITH TODAY'S CLOUD 
AND SHOWERS IT'S BEEN WARM 
ALTHOUGH THEY WILL EASE IT WILL 
REMAIN HUMID FOR THE MEANTIME WE 
HAVE SHARP SHOWERS RUNNING UP 
THROUGH CHESHIRE AS YOU CAN SEE 
THROUGH THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT 
THAT RISK DIMINISHES FURTHER WEST 
A LITTLE COOLER BUT WE WILL HAVE 
PROBLEMS WITH SOME DENSE FOG AROUND 
THE COAST IN PARTICULAR THE FOG 
INLAND SHOULD CLEAR QUICKER WE 
WILL STILL HAVE THE CLOUDY ZONE 
GRADUALLY MIGRATING WEST THROUGH 
THE DAY SUNSHINE EITHER SIDE OF IT 
FOR MOST OF US IT SHOULD LAST WITH 
THAT ALL DAY FOR NORTHERN IRELAND 
ALTHOUGH WE CAN SEE SOME SEA FOG 
THROUGH THE DAY NOT GREAT ACROSS 
THE ISLE OF MAN INLAND SOME 
GLORIOUS SUNSHINE TWENTY IN GLASGOW L. 
THINK THE ABERDEEN COAST MIGHT BE 
PLAGUED BY LOW CLOUD AT THE SAME 
TIME IT WILL HAVE ALLOWED THE 
SUNSHINE TO RETURN FOR EAST ANGLIA 
AND THE SOUTH EAST LIFTING THE 
TEMPERATURES TO TWENTY TWO DEGREES EVEN 
WITHOUT THE SUNSHINE WE WILL SEE 
THE HIGH TEENS IF THE SUN DOES 
BREAK THROUGH THAT COULD TRIGGER 
SHARPER OUTBREAK WAS RAIN COMPARED 
WITH TODAY THERE WON'T BE AS MUCH 
RAIN AND IT WON'T BE AS INTENSE 
WESTERN AREAS COULD CLEAR FINE AND 
DRY AS WE 
ONLY YO OU 
CAN MAKE THIS WORLD SEEM BRIGHT 
WE GOT COMPANY 
ONLY YOU 
SOME THINGS GET BETTER WITH AGE
