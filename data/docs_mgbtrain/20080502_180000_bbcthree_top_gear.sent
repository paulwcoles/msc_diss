RICHARD SMOKES A HORSE 
AND IN OUR REASONABLY PRICED CAR 
OH IT'S HIS ASSISTANT 
HELLO HELLO AND WELCOME 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WE START TONIGHT WITH STRETCHED LIMOUSINES 
THERE ARE NINE THOUSAND OF THE DAMN THINGS IN BRITAIN 
AND THEY'RE ALL AMERICAN CARS THAT HAVE BEEN ELONGATED AND THEN COATED WITH A VENEER OF VELOUR 
WHY WHY CAN'T LIMOS BE BASED ON NORMAL CARS THAT WE CAN BUY IN BRITAIN 
I MEAN HOW HARD CAN IT BE 
WELL TO FIND OUT WE WERE ALL THREE ASKED TO BUILD OUR OWN LIMOUSINES 
THE RECIPE'S SIMPLE FIND A CAR ANYTHING WE LIKED 
CUT IT IN HALF AND PUT AN EXTRA BIT IN THE MIDDLE 
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG 
THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO BASE MY LIMO ON 
YES IT'S A NINETEEN NINETY THREE TEN LITRE FIAT PANDA C. L. X. 
THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS CAR IS THAT UNDER THE BONNET IT DOESN'T HAVE AN ENGINE 
WHAT YOU GET INSTEAD IS A SMALL FIELD MOUSE CALLED GERALD 
AND IF GERALD RUNS ROUND HIS WHEEL VERY VERY FAST 
HE'LL GET ME FROM ZERO SIXTY IN EIGHTEEN SECONDS 
DON'T WORRY THOUGH THERE'S METHOD IN MY MADNESS 
WHY START OFF WITH A BIG CAR WHEN YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT BIG ANYWAY 
AND WHY HAVE A BIG THIRSTY ENGINE WHEN YOU'LL SPEND MOST OF YOUR TIME IN TOWN DOING TEN M. P. H. 
AND IF YOU PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN EVERYONE IN THE BACK'S GONNA SPILL THEIR POMAGNE 
MY LIMO WILL BE BASED ON THIS A SENSIBLE SAAB NINE THOUSAND THIRTY LITRE V. SIX 
YOU'RE THINKING THERE GOES CAPTAIN SLOW 
AND I EXPECT HE'LL DO A REALLY GOOD JOB OF TURNING IT INTO A LIMOUSINE 
BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT HE'S A BIT BORING 
YOU CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO COMPREHEND THE BOUNDS OF MY FORTHCOMING GENIUS 
FOR MY LIMO I THOUGHT A BIT LATERALLY 
IT'S AN M. G. F. WHICH AS YOU'VE PROBABLY NOTICED IS A TWO SEATER 
AT THE MOMENT 
BECAUSE WHAT I PLAN TO CREATE HERE 
IS QUITE POSSIBLY THE WORLD'S FIRST MID ENGINED ROADSTER LIMOUSINE 
WHY SHOULDN'T HEN NIGHTS HAVE THAT WIND IN THE HAIR OPEN TOP THRILL 
SO WE'D ALL GOT OUR CARS AND WE'D ALL FOUND PEOPLE 
WHO WERE GOING TO HELP US TURN THEM INTO LIMOS 
THIS IS THE VERY SAME WORKSHOP 
WHERE WE MADE OUR CONVERTIBLE PEOPLE CARRIER 
AND THAT WORKED 
THIS JOB THOUGH WOULD REQUIRE MUCH MORE PRECISION 
RIGHT WHERE ARE MY HAMMERS 
MEANWHILE AT MY WORKSHOP 
MY GENIUS PLAN WAS TO MATE THE SAAB WITH A SECOND CAR 
AND HERE IT IS IT'S AN ALFA ROMEO ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR THIRTY LITRE V. SIX 
AND I KNOW IT SEEMS ODD BUT THINK ABOUT IT 
NO ONE EVER SAID THAT THE TWO ENDS OF A STRETCH LIMO 
HAD TO COME FROM THE SAME CAR 
I'D PICKED SOME MOTORSPORT SPECIALISTS 
TO HELP WITH THE SPORTS LIMO 
THERE ARE A FEW CONCERNS 
LARGELY BECAUSE THE ENGINE IS PRETTY MUCH AT THE BACK 
SO ALL THE THINGS LIKE THESE RADIATOR PIPES AND GEARBOX LINKAGE 
AND THE THROTTLE THEY'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO BE SORT OF MADE LONGER 
RIGHT THIS IS THE REALLY CLEVER BIT 
ALTHOUGH THE SAAB AND THE ALFA LOOK VERY DIFFERENT 
UNDERNEATH THEY'VE GOT THE SAME FLOOR PLAN 
AND AS MY CENTRE LINE SHOWS THE WHEELBASE IS EXACTLY THE SAME 
IT'LL BE SENSIBLE AND SWEDISH AT ONE END 
AND FIERY AND ITALIAN AT THE BACK 
IT IS A SALFA ROMEAAB 
HERE'S A TOP GEAR TOP TIP RENT ONE OF THESE THIRTY FIVE A DAY 
IF THERE'S SOMEONE YOU DON'T LIKE VERY MUCH CUT THEIR CAR IN HALF 
MY FIRST JOB WAS TO CUT ALL THE PIPES LEADING TO THE ENGINE 
OH THAT WENT REALLY REALLY WELL 
THERE THAT'S DISCONNECTED 
WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO CUT IT IN HALF 
I WON'T GET INTO A CUTTING IN HALF COMPETITION 
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO 
WHAT AM I GONNA DO 
MAKE A MESS OF IT 
OH THAT'S NOT A GOOD TIME 
HELLO HAMSTER 
OH BUGGER 
YES HOW'S IT GOING 
REALLY WELL ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WHAT JAMES HAS GOT 
YEAH A SAAB 
NO HE'S GOT AN ALFA 
NO IT'S A SAAB 
NO HE'S GOT AN ALFA 
HE DEFINITELY TOLD ME HE'D GOT A SAAB 
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT CAR HE'S GOT 
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE'S BOUGHT 
IS IT TRUE THAT JEREMY'S BOUGHT A FIAT PANDA 
YEAH 
IF YOU WERE MAKING A STRETCHED CAR WHY WOULD YOU START WITH THAT 
YOU CAN STRETCH IT A MILE AND IT'D STILL ONLY BE A NORMAL CAR 
HAVE YOU MET JEREMY CLARKSON BEFORE BIG TALL FELLA CURLY HAIR IDIOT 
THAT'S YOUR ANSWER ISN'T IT 
FINALLY IT WAS TIME TO CUT OUR CARS IN HALF 
NO WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
CUTTING IT IN HALF 
THAT'S HALFWAY MATE THAT'S ABOUT HALFWAY 
I'M NOT MEASURING IT 
WHERE ARE YOU PUTTING YOUR SEAT 
WHERE'S ALL THE STRENGTH BULKHEAD 
IT'S ALL RIGHT I'LL WELD THAT BIT UP 
INEVITABLY JAMES WAS BEING SCIENTIFIC ABOUT THE PROJECT 
AND WAS SAWING HIS CAR IN HALF USING A PLASMA CUTTER 
NOW WATCH THIS 
BLUE PETER THEME 
I DO KNOW WHAT I'M DOING 
I'VE MADE A BIT OF PLATE AND I'M GONNA WELD IT 
OVER THE LITTLE HOLE THERE AND YOU'LL NEVER KNOW THE DIFFERENCE 
BY USING PATIENCE AND MATHS TO MAKE MY LIMO 
I WAS DOING A DAMN SIGHT BETTER THAN HAMMOND 
OOH BAD BAD THING SORRY 
IT'S LOCKED I CAN'T GET IN 
THE CAR'S BURNING DOWN BEFORE I'VE EVEN BUILT IT 
THAT'S BAD THAT'S BAD 
JEREMY HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS 
AND COULDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER WORKED 
PULL THIS SAFETY PINS 
THAT'S FIRE 
EVENTUALLY THE FIRES WERE PUT OUT 
AND BY TEA TIME RICHARD'S CAR WAS IN HALF 
THERE IT IS 
SHORTLY AFTERWARDS MINE WAS UN CONJOINED AS WELL 
BEHOLD THE BROKEN CAR 
AND WITH JAMES'S SAAB PREDICTABLY STILL IN ONE PIECE 
I DECIDED TO MAKE SURE THAT MECHANICALLY AT LEAST 
MY LITTLE FIAT HAD SURVIVED THE OPERATION 
AND I'M DELIGHTED TO SAY IT HAD 
YEAH 
OBVIOUSLY WE WILL BE PICKING THAT UP LATER ON 
BUT NOW IT'S TIME TO DO THE NEWS 
WE BEGIN WELL ACTUALLY WE BEGIN WITH LAST WEEK 
BECAUSE YOU MOCKED ME FOR WEARING A SUIT YOU MAY REMEMBER THIS YES 
BECAUSE KRISTIN SCOTT THOMAS WAS DOWN HERE 
TUESDAY HE WALKED INTO THE OFFICE DRESSED LIKE THIS 
YEAH LOOK AT HIM 
WHERE'D YOU BEEN 
I'D BEEN INVITED TO NUMBER TEN 
TO A ONE ON ONE CHAT WITH THE PRIME MINISTER 
SO YOU GO THERE YOU'RE IN NUMBER TEN SITTING WITH HIM YEAH DID YOU VOMIT ON HIM 
YOU CAN'T 
YOU CAN'T VOMIT ON THE PRIME MINISTER MATE 
YOU CAN IF YOU HAD LOADS OF CHEESE SOUP BEFORE YOU GET THERE 
AND THEN LIKE SOME SALT WATER BLOOPH ALL OVER HIM 
YOU COULD HAVE DONE THAT NO 
BUT YOU DIDN'T NO I DIDN'T DID YOU PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE NO 
LOOK I DIDN'T VOMIT ON OR PUNCH THE PRIME MINISTER IN THE FACE O. K. 
HOW CLOSE WERE YOU TO HIM AT ANY ONE POINT 
I WAS SITTING NEXT TO HIM LOOK THERE'S A PICTURE THERE IT IS 
YOU COULD HAVE EASILY PUNCHED HIM IN THE FACE YOU IDIOT 
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN SICK ALL OVER HIS LEG AND HIS CUFFLINKS 
LOOK THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS THAT YOU'RE BEST AT IN THE WORLD 
BEING SICK AND PUNCHING PEOPLE 
HE CAME ROUND TO YOUR HOUSE ONCE DIDN'T HE 
ONE TIME YOU CAME TO MY HOUSE AND VOMITED ALL OVER MY SOFA 
SORRY ABOUT THAT 
MY HOUSE VOMITED ALL OVER ME I DID DO THAT 
SO YOU SEE WHY COULDN'T YOU VOMIT OVER HIM 
I'M SORRY HE'D INVITED ME ROUND FOR A CHAT 
SO IT WASN'T APPROPRIATE ABOUT WHAT ROAD PRICING 
WHAT DID HE SAY THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT CONGESTION 
DID YOU TELL HIM TO GET RID OF THE BLOODY M. FOUR BUS LANE 
DID YOU TELL HIM THAT I DIDN'T SAY THAT I WASN'T SICK ON HIM 
DID YOU TELL HIM TO GET RID OF SPEED HUMPS NO 
DID YOU TELL HIM TO UP THE SPEED LIMIT ON THE MOTORWAY TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
DID YOU TELL HIM THAT ALL RIGHT I'M BEGINNING 
PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE 
I LET YOU DOWN LADS I'M SORRY 
BECAUSE O. K. ROAD PRICING IS COMING AND IT'S HIS FAULT 
I NOW REALISE I'VE LET YOU DOWN AND I'M SORRY IT'S NOT US 
YOU'VE LET EVERYBODY DOWN YOU'VE LET HIM DOWN 
HE CAN'T EVEN AFFORD PROPER CLOTHES 
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST PERSON IN BRITISH HISTORY 
TO PUNCH THE PRIME MINISTER IN THE FACE AND BE SICK ON HIM ALL RIGHT 
I WILL BE THE FIRST PERSON TO PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE ON T. V. 
NOW THAT'S MORE LIKE IT 
CAN WE MOVE ON YES WE CAN MOVE ON 
NOW THERE'S A NEW MONDEO COMING OUT IN JUNE WE'VE GOT A PICTURE 
IT'LL BE BRILLIANT THE LAST ONE WAS IT WAS BRILLIANT AT EVERYTHING 
A COUPLE OF THINGS 
I THINK IT'S GOT A BIT TOO MUCH MASCARA ROUND ITS HEADLAMPS 
IT'S I HAD A BIT OF THAT GOING ON IN THE STUDIO LAST WEEK 
THE MAKE UP LADY PUT TOO MUCH 
HANG ON 
YOU WERE WEARING YOU WERE WEARING MASCARA 
WELL IT'S WHATEVER THE MAKE UP LADY PUTS ON US BEFORE WE WALK IN 
SHE YES I GUESS SO I DON'T KNOW 
YOU LET HER OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD YOU LET HER MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE A SPANIEL EVERY WEEK SO 
I JUST WANT TO GET BACK TO THE CAR 
THE OTHER THING IS I'VE LOOKED AT ITS ENGINE SPECS 
THERE'S EIGHTEENS AND DIESELS AND TWENTIES THERE'S NO HOT ONE 
YOU REMEMBER THE DAYS OF THE CORTINA 
THERE WAS THE LOTUS CORTINA AND THE SIERRA COSWORTH 
THERE'S NO HOT VERSION OF THIS COS WHAT YOU WANT IS A MONDEO VINDALOO 
ACTUALLY WHAT IF THEY JUST NAME THE WHOLE RANGE AFTER CURRIES 
DEPENDING ON HOW HOT THEY ARE 
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA 
YOU COULD DO LIKE SAINSBURY'S DO WITH THOSE LITTLE CHILLIES ON THE BACK 
I COULD HAVE THE JALFREZI 
HE COULD HAVE THE KORMA YES 
THAT'S FAST ENOUGH FOR ME I REALLY DO LIKE THAT IDEA 
YOU'RE BRINGING TOGETHER TWO GREAT BRITISH INSTITUTIONS INDIAN FOOD AND A CAR MADE IN BELGIUM 
YOU KNOW THAT NEW LAW ABOUT KIDS UNDER FOUR FEET FIVE INCHES 
THEY HAVE TO USE A BOOSTER SEAT IN THE CAR 
HE DOES YES ALL RIGHT 
I JUST KNEW ALL RIGHT PEOPLE UNDER FOUR FEET FIVE INCHES HAVE TO USE A BOOSTER SEAT IN THE CAR 
WELL IN NORTH YORKSHIRE THE POLICE SAY THEY CANNOT ENFORCE THAT LAW AND DO YOU KNOW WHY 
THEY DO NOT HAVE THE 
THEY DO NOT HAVE THE LEGAL 
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS NOW THE LEGAL 
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO MEASURE CHILDREN 
TO JUST MEASURE THEM 
SO IF YOU SEE A POLICEMAN MEASURING YOUR CHILDREN YOU THINK QUICK CALL THE 
SO THEY'LL HAVE TO DO WHAT THEY USUALLY DO AND PUT UP A CAMERA BY THE ROAD TO MONITOR CHILDREN 
NO YOU CAN'T VIDEO CHILDREN HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO A SPORTS DAY 
YOU HAVE ASK EVERY PARENT THERE BEFORE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO TAKE THE CAMERA OUT OF THE BOOT 
GO TO YOUR OWN KIDS' SPORTS DAY MAYBE THEY'LL LET YOU 
NOW EARLIER ON YOU SAW US BUY SOME OLD CARS AND SET ABOUT TURNING THEM INTO STRETCHED LIMOUSINES 
NEXT WE WERE TOLD TO REPORT TO THE TOP GEAR TEST TRACK ON A BITTERLY COLD DAY 
WHERE WE WOULD BE GIVEN A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES 
PUSHER BY STEPPENWOLF 
WELL HERE IT IS MY SPORTS LIMO 
PROOF THAT STYLE DOES NOT HAVE TO BE SLOW 
IT IS GENIUS THIS TIME ONCE AND FOR ALL I AM GOING TO WIN 
I SHALL BE VICTORIOUS 
ALSO SPRACH ZARATHUSTRA BY RICHARD STRAUSS 
OH MY GOD 
IT'S A GIANT PANDA 
NEVER BEFORE BRED IN CAPTIVITY 
THAT IS A BIG PANDA 
IT IS 
COS THIS IS AN ECONOMICAL LIMO TEN LITRE ENGINE FORTY TO THE GALLON 
IT'S CAN WE DO YOU MIND IT'S MY SPORTS LIMO MATE 
THE FIRST THING I SAW OBVIOUSLY WAS THE SPOILER 
IT'S PROPORTIONAL TO THE CAR YOU NEED DOWN FORCE DO YOU 
IT'S PART OF THE IMAGE AND IMAGE IS EVERYTHING 
CAN I ALSO SAY YOU'VE NO ROOF I HAVE 
THAT'S IT 
WELL IT WAS COMPLICATED 
THAT'S IT THERE IS A GAP THERE ARE TOLERANCES HERE 
I CAN ONLY WORK TO SO MUCH 
THEME FROM KNIGHT RIDER 
THEN MAY TURNED UP AND BOY WERE WE IN FOR A SHOCK 
HANG ON ER 
NOW THAT THAT I DIDN'T EXPECT 
I'M CONFUSED WELL CAN I JUST EXPLAIN 
IT'S ALL ABOUT CHOICE 
AT THE FRONT IT'S A SENSIBLE SWEDISH SAAB NINE THOUSAND 
AND AT THE FRONT IT'S A SPORTY AND STYLISH ITALIAN ALFA ROMEO 
WHAT KIND OF PAINT THINNER WERE YOU SNIFFING WHEN YOU THOUGHT OF THIS 
THAT THEME STYLE SENSIBLENESS SWEDEN ITALY 
I'VE CONTINUED THAT ON THE INSIDE 
AT THIS END IT IS 
A SAUNA 
DOES IT WORK NO 
AND AT THE OTHER END ARE YOU READY IT IS 
THE SISTINE CHAPEL 
CAN YOU DRIVE IT BOTH WAYS YES 
THAT'S THE BRILLIANT THING ABOUT IT WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH A LIMOUSINE WHAT MANOEUVRABILITY 
NO I'M FINE ON THAT HE MAY HAVE AN ISSUE WITH 
IT IS VERY THIN 
OUR FIRST TASK WAS TO TEST OUT EACH OTHER'S CARS 
AND WE BEGAN WITH THE PANDA'S BRILLIANT PASSENGER ENTRY SYSTEM 
HAVE YOU TWO NEVER SEEN THE GREAT ESCAPE 
I MEAN IT'S PERFECTLY STRAIGHTFORWARD 
YOU'VE GOT THIS PULLEY 
YOU LIE ON THIS O. K. 
AND BRITNEY SPEARS IS GONNA DO THAT YEAH 
THIS IS IDEAL FOR PEOPLE WHO USED TO BE MINERS 
I THOUGHT YOU HAD SNIFFED THINNERS MAKING THAT 
JAMES OFFERED TO JOIN ME IN THE BACK 
HERE HE COMES 
IT'S AN INGENIOUS SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE EXISTED 
NEXT I INTRODUCED HAMMOND TO THE IN CAR COMMUNICATIONS 
THERE'S AN INTERCOM SYSTEM 
IT'S HANDS FREE SO IF YOU PUT THAT THING ROUND YOUR NECK 
IT'S LIKE A ONE MAN BAND THING IT'S LEGAL 
THIS ISN'T THE MOST ELEGANT SOLUTION 
I HAVE LITERALLY THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING I'M PULLING AWAY HOLD ON TIGHT 
YOU'LL NOTICE AS YOU SWING AROUND 
IT DOESN'T HAVE QUITE THAT SAME RESPONSIVENESS 
I'M RUNNING OUT OF RUNWAY 
I'M SORRY I'M ON THE FIELD A BIT 
THE FLEX TAKES SOME OF THE JOLTING OUT OF IT 
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE 
YOU'VE GONE OVER A RUNWAY LIGHT YOU BLITHERING IDIOT 
WELL YOU MADE THE CAR A MILE LONG IT'S HARDLY MY FAULT 
EVEN ON OUR ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOOT WIDE RUNWAY MANOEUVRABILITY WAS AN ISSUE 
BUT WE DID AT LEAST FIND A NEW WAY OF SPEEDING UP 
MY PASSENGER ENTRY AND EXIT SYSTEM 
HERE WE GO BRITNEY CLARKSON IS LEAVING THE CAR 
O. K. WE'RE ARRIVING I'LL BRAKE 
YOU'VE GOT IT'S AN ALL OVER CARPET BURN 
HOW DO I EXPLAIN THIS TO MY WIFE 
NEXT WE TRIED JAMES'S ALFAAB 
JAMES YEP A BIT OF AN ISSUE I'VE GOT HERE WHAT 
HEADROOM THERE'S LOADS OF IT WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM 
HE'S PUT A SAUNA IN THIS END AND HE'S PUT IT ON THE ROOF 
YOUR BEER FOUNTAIN YES IT'S JUST MAKING ME WANT TO PEE 
BUT AS PROBLEMS GO THAT WAS NOTHING 
WHAT DOES THIS DO NO DON'T PULL THAT 
OH MY GOD WHAT'S HAPPENED 
HAMMOND'S UNLOCKED THE STEERING SORRY YOU IDIOT 
STOP STOP 
TO TRY AND REGAIN CONTROL OF THE REAR 
HAMMOND DIVED FOR THE WHEEL OF THE ALFA 
NOT THAT WAY IS THAT HELPING NO 
I'LL GO THE OTHER WAY HANG ON 
THAT'S BAD FOR THE SAUNA 
JAMES 
YOU PAIR OF UTTER PILLOCKS 
YOU'VE RUINED MY CAR IF I WAS DRIVING IT LIKE A LIMOUSINE 
AND YOU TWO WEREN'T JUST BEING YOBBOS TRYING TO BREAK EVERYTHING THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN 
THE ENGINEERING IN JAMES'S LIMO HADN'T FARED WELL 
SO TIME TO TRY OUT HAMMOND'S CONVERTIBLE 
WHERE IS THE HEATER 
WELL THAT IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE ENGINE OF COURSE IS AT THE BACK 
AND THE PIPES IT HASN'T GOT ONE 
YOU'RE THE STUPIDEST MAN I'VE EVER MET I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THOUGH 
YOUR CAR'S RUBBISH I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THOUGH PUT THE ROOF UP MIND YOUR HEAD 
OH YOU SEE IT'S NO BETTER WITH THE ROOF UP 
IF ANYTHING IT CATCHES THE BREEZE I THINK 
IT'S GONE THAT DOES HAPPEN HOW DO I TELL JAMES TO SLOW DOWN 
ER THAT'S BRILLIANT WE CALL HIM ON THIS 
WHAT TELL HIM TO SLOW DOWN COULD YOU SLOW DOWN A LITTLE 
JAMES YES WHAT DO YOU WANT 
CAN YOU SEE US YES 
VERY FUNNY 
TO WARM UP A BIT HAMMOND SUGGESTED 
WE TRY SOME OF HIS ON BOARD SPORTS EQUIPMENT 
GO 
THE OTHER THING THAT HAMMOND HAS DONE 
IS THAT HE'S FIXED THE SEAT IN HIS OW 
WITH OUR TEST DRIVES OVER IT WAS TIME FOR THE CHALLENGES TO BEGIN 
NOT ALL LIMO DRIVERS ARE DRUG DEALERS 
NOT ALL LIMOS ARE USED FOR HEN NIGHTS 
SOME HAVE TO BE USED FOR TRANSPORTING POLITICAL FIGURES WHO MAY BE ATTACKED AT ANY TIME 
YOUR CARS THEN SHOULD BE NIMBLE AND FAST ENOUGH TO GET OUT OF TRICKY SPOTS 
WELL THAT'S YOU IN TROUBLE ISN'T IT 
FOR THE FIRST CHALLENGE YOU ARRIVE AT A ROAD BLOCK 
THE OTHER TWO PRESENTERS ARE THERE ARMED WITH PAINTBALL GUNS 
HOW MANY HITS CAN THEY SCORE BEFORE YOU'VE DONE A J. TURN AND GOT AWAY 
HE'S IN A CONVERTIBLE 
OH NO I HADN'T THOUGHT 
I WAS FIRST TO DRIVE INTO THE JAWS OF DEATH 
THE PROFESSIONALS THEME 
OH NO A PATHETIC ROADBLOCK 
NOW J. TURN YOU REVERSE AT HIGH SPEED BRAKE SPIN THE WHEEL 
AND AS THE FRONT SLEWS ROUND YOU SLAM IT INTO FIRST AND ROAR AWAY 
I MUST BE HONEST 
THE PANDA WASN'T MUCH GOOD 
IT'S QUITE TIRING ON THE TRIGGER FINGER 
I'M GETTING SHOT A FEW TIMES NOW 
AH YEAH QUITE A LOT YEAH YOU MAY HAVE 
YOU COULD GET MORE PAINT ON IT IF YOU USED A BRUSH 
WITH MY PANDA HAVING SET THE BAR PRETTY LOW THE CONVERTIBLE WENT NEXT 
I HOPE I DON'T MEET ANY TERRORISTS 
OH NO TERRORISTS 
DO YOUR J. TURN 
THE SPEED WAS GOOD THE PROTECTION NOT SO GOOD 
OH THAT'S SORE ON THE HEAD 
I GOT ONE THERE AND ONE THERE DID IT HURT YES LIKE A. LIKE A WORD YOU CAN'T SAY 
UNFORTUNATELY I SUSPECT I'VE BEATEN YOU YOU HAVE BEATEN ME 
RIGHT JAMES GOOD LUCK 
INSTEAD OF DOING THE TRICKY J. TURN I PLANNED TO GET INTO THE ALFA END AND REVERSE AWAY FORWARDS 
BUT THAT IDEA DID HAVE A FLAW 
IN FACT IT HAD TWO FLAWS 
OH THE WHEEL OH 
OH LOOK YOU AIMED AT MY GENTLEMAN'S AREA 
THAT WAS AGONY 
THERE IS FAR MORE ON YOU THAN ON YOUR CAR 
IN THAT CASE I'VE WON NO 
THE RULES SAY IN A REAL SITUATION YOU'D BE NEVER MIND AT LEAST MY CAR'S NOT GOT PAINT ON IT 
THE RULES SAY HITS ON THE CAR NOT HITS ON THE WEDDING VEGETABLES 
IT WAS TIME FOR THE NEXT CHALLENGE 
I HOPE THAT WAS THE END OF THE EVASIVE DRIVING STUFF 
EVASIVE DRIVING PART TWO 
IT'S A TEST OF NIPPINESS AGAINST THE CLOCK 
YOU BREAK OUT FROM A TERRORIST TRAP SLALOM DOWN THE RUNWAY BETWEEN CARS WHICH YOU MAY NOT HIT 
THE WHAT 
WITH MANOEUVRABILITY BEING THE KEY TO EVERY ASPECT OF THIS CHALLENGE JAMES WAS FEELING CONFIDENT 
WATCH THIS DOH 
HANG ON 
HOW IS HE GOING TO DO A SLALOM IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP AT ALL 
HAMMERHEAD 
THE WATER CANNON KICKED IN TO MAKE MISSING THE STINGER EVEN HARDER 
EASY VICTORY 
WELL MAYBE NOT 
MY SPORTS LIMO WAS LIKE A GREYHOUND OUT OF THE TRAP 
WHEEL SPIN AND EVERYTHING 
THAT LOOKS QUITE GOOD I CAN'T SEE KOFI ANNAN EVER GETTING INTO IT 
IT'S THE STINGER NO IT'S THE WATER 
CONVERTIBLE AS IT TURNS OUT NOT THE BEST IDEA 
THE PANDA BROKE OUT WITH EASE 
YES ROCK'N'ROLL 
HOW'S HE GOING TO DO THE SLALOM 
LOOKING GOOD 
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THE WORLD'S MOST ENORMOUS ROUTE 
OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD 
OH NO I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE IT 
THAT IS SUCH A POOR IDEA 
OH NO 
THERE'S SOME SMOKE COMING OUT OF IT DOESN'T THAT BREAK YOUR HEART 
THE CLOCK'S STILL RUNNING 
MY LIMO HAD BECOME BOGGED DOWN 
BUT THE FILM CREW KINDLY PUSHED ME OUT AND I WAS ON MY WAY AGAIN 
YOU CAN SQUIRT IT AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE 
SADLY I HIT THE STINGER 
WHICH PUNCTURED THE TYRES AND WORSE MY ENGINE DIED 
I WAS SOAKED 
SOAKED WHY WHAT 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY DID YOU GET OUT OF THE CAR 
I HAD A PUNCTURE THE ENGINE HAD STOPPED I THOUGHT IF I GOT OUT I COULD CHANGE THE WHEEL 
DID YOU SERIOUSLY THINK THAT THE WATER CANNON HOW COULD THEY NOT TURN IT ON AND HIT YOU 
WITH HINDSIGHT I SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN THE CAR ANYWAY THAT WASN'T THE FINAL CHALLENGE 
THERE WAS ANOTHER BIG ONE WHERE WE BROUGHT THE WHOLE OF CENTRAL LONDON TO A STANDSTILL 
WE'LL SHOW THAT TO YOU LATER YOUR LIMO DOWN ONE SIDE WERE WINDOWS ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE WERE NONE 
PAPARAZZI PROOF 
IF YOU'VE GOT BRITNEY SPEARS IN AND SHE'S FORGOTTEN HER PANTS AS SHE DOES 
WHICH SHE'S PRONE TO DO AND NOW SHE'S GOT MATCHING COLLAR AND CUFFS 
ON THE KERB SIDE THERE WERE NO WINDOWS I THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING 
CAN I JUST ASK WHY YOU SHOT ME IN THE PENIS 
IF YOU THINK I COULD HIT THAT WHEN YOU WERE FIFTY F. T. AWAY AND RUNNING 
IT'S NOW TIME TO PUT A STAR IN OUR REASONABLY PRICED CAR 
MY GUEST IS ATTRACTIVE FUTURISTIC AND FROM SWINDON 
SHE'S SORT OF LIKE THE HONDA CIVIC 
BILLIE PIPER

LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR LAP HOW WAS IT OUT THERE UM IT WAS O. K. 
IT WAS A LOT HARDER THAN I IMAGINED I GOT A BIT ANGRY AS WELL WHICH I DON'T THINK IS GOOD 
ANGRY WITH THE STIG WITH MYSELF NOT WITH THE STIG I LOVE THE STIG HE WAS VERY PATIENT VERY GENEROUS 
WAS HE YEAH 
IT'S JUST UNFORTUNATE THAT HE'S GOT A REALLY TONED BODY DOES HE 
AND A FACE LIKE THE ELEPHANT MAN THAT'S A SHAME 
DID YOU CALL CHRIS UP TO GET YEAH

WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT ALL RIGHT WHO'D LIKE TO SEE BILLIE'S LAP 
YEAH LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
SHAKE AND BAKE SECOND 
YOU CUT THE CORNER A LITTLE BIT THERE BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER COS IT JUST SLOWS YOU DOWN 
WHERE ARE YOU GOING YOU'RE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD 
INTO THE HAMMERHEAD 
AND AGAIN THAT'S ENTIRELY THE WRONG ROUTE 
OH GOD THIS IS TERRIBLE 
JONATHAN ROSS WAS THE LAST PERSON HERE TO GET THIS LOST 
HELL 
YEAH THE RIGHT WAY THAT'S GOOD 
THIS IS WHERE EVERYONE GETS IT WRONG 
BUT THAT'S A VERY GOOD LINE THERE AND THEN THIS ISN'T 
AND THERE WE ARE AND ACROSS THE LINE 
WHERE DO YOU RECKON ON THE BOARD THAT WAS 
PLEASE TELL ME I'M ABOVE STEVE COOGAN 
WELL YOU ARE HOWEVER WE DO HAVE A PROBLEM WHY 
YOU DID IT IN ONE MINUTE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE 
TO THE STUNNED SILENCE AND AMAZEMENT OF THE ENTIRE AUDIENCE 
THE PROBLEM WE'VE GOT IS WE'VE HAD TO HAVE A WORD WITH HIS STIGNESS 
WHY WELL BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T REALLY DO A LAP OF THE TRACK 
YOU DIDN'T DO THE SAME LAP THAT ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE 
DOES THAT MATTER WELL 
YES IT DOES NO IT DOESN'T PLEASE NO 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE THE STIG RECKONS IT'S A THREE SECOND PENALTY FOR CUTTING THE CORNERS 
AWW 
I TOLD YOU HE WAS UNPLEASANT HE'S NOT A NICE MAN 
WHAT DO WE THINK LEAVE LEAVE IT THERE 
LEAVE IT THERE 
PEOPLE POWER I'M QUITE HAPPY WITH THAT 
I COULD GET HOME IN REALLY QUICK TIME IF I JUST DROVE STRAIGHT ACROSS 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BILLIE PIPER 
NOW THIS IS THE NEW MUSTANG 
I SHALL NOW EXPLAIN WITH A HISTORY LESSON 
ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT THE MUSTANG 
IS THAT IT REINTRODUCED DRIVERS TO THE IDEA OF SPEC ING UP YOUR CAR 
WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES NOBODY WANTED A STANDARD ONE WITH A SIX CYLINDER ENGINE 
THEY WANTED ONES LIKE THIS THE G. T. THREE NINETY 
THIS IS THE BULLET MUSTANG THE ONE STEVE MCQUEEN HURLED INTO MOVIE HISTORY 
AROUND THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO 
THE G. T. THREE NINETY IS IN CAR TERMS ONE OF THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD 
THE NOISE THE PRESENCE 
VERY VERY FEW CARS LIVE UP TO THEIR HYPE 
BUT THIS CAR DOES AND I SHOULD KNOW BECAUSE THIS IS MY G. T. THREE NINETY 
I'M USING IT TO MAKE A MUSTANG POINT 
EVERYTHING THAT MADE IT GOOD 
THE ENGINE THE LIGHTS THE STRIPES WAS EXTRA 
IF YOU WANTED A GOOD ONE YOU HAD TO FORGET CHEAP AND CHEERFUL AND GO FOR THE BELLS AND WHISTLES VERSION 
THAT IS WHAT HAS BEEN MISSING SO FAR FROM THE NEW ONE 
UNTIL NOW 
THIS IS THE MUSTANG G. T. FIVE HUNDRED 
FROM EVERY ANGLE YOU CAN SEE ITS MUSCLE CAR BICEPS STRAINING TO BURST OUT OF THE BODYWORK 
IT'S ALSO FESTOONED WITH MENACING COBRA BADGES A TRIBUTE TO THE LEGENDARY CARROLL SHELBY 
SHELBY ONLY EVER PUT HIS NAME TO THE FASTEST AND MOST POWERFUL MUSTANGS 
WHICH MEANS THIS THING HAS GOT TO BE MORE THAN JUST A FASHION STATEMENT 
AND IT IS 
GOOD GOD 
YOU SEE THIS CAR HAS THE SUPERCHARGED V. EIGHT FROM THE FORD G. T. 
WHICH MEANS POWER GOES UP FROM THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED HORSEPOWER 
NOUGHT TO SIXTY FORTY NINE SECONDS 
NOUGHT TO ONE HUNDRED TEN SECONDS 
IN AMERICA THE G. T. FIVE HUNDRED HAS GONE DOWN A STORM 
THE QUEUES ARE OUT OF THE DOOR AND ROUND THE BLOCK 
NOW IF YOU WAIT YOUR TURN YOU COULD PUT ONE OF THESE ON YOUR DRIVE IN BRITAIN FOR THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND 
SOUNDS TEMPTING QUESTION IS SHOULD YOU 
THIS IS A ROLLING ROAD IT'S A SORT OF LIE DETECTOR FOR ENGINES AND GIVES THE TRUE HORSEPOWER READING 
LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS 
WHAT'S THE SCORE REALLY 
RIGHT 
SO THIS G. T. FIVE HUNDRED 
ACTUALLY MAKES FOUR HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
ALMOST THERE YOU GO THAT SEEMS FAIR ENOUGH 
THINKING ABOUT IT WHILE I'VE GOT THE MACHINE HERE 
PLEASE DON'T HURT IT 
IT HAD WHEN IT WAS BRAND NEW THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE HORSEPOWER 
I'M ASSURED BY THE MAN WHO SOLD ME IT THAT THIS IS A FINE EXAMPLE OF THE BREED 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
ANYWAY BACK TO THE JOB IN HAND AND SPEAKING OF DISAPPOINTMENTS 
MULTILINK GEOMETRY DUAL REMOTE RESERVOIR DAMPERS FULLY INDEPENDENT REAR SUSPENSION 
WHAT THIS CAR USES IS A LIVE AXLE WHICH AS REAR SUSPENSION GOES IS BASICALLY A WHACKING GREAT GIRDER 
WITH A WHEEL AT EACH END 
IT'S NOT EXACTLY THE MOST MODERN LAYOUT NOAH'S ARK HAD A SIMILAR SET UP 
BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY IS OLD FASHIONED WE CAN HAVE SOME GOOD OLD FASHIONED FUN 
FORD SAY THEY DIDN'T GIVE THE G. T. FIVE HUNDRED MODERN SUSPENSION 
BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE ADDED FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE PRICE OF EACH CAR 
THAT IS A RIDICULOUS DECISION 
YOU CAN'T JUST GIVE A CAR AN EXTRA TWO HUNDRED BRAKE HORSEPOWER AND THEN LEAVE IT WITH PREHISTORIC SUSPENSION 
WHAT YOU'RE LEFT WITH IS A CAR THAT LOOKS GREAT AND GOES FAST IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND THAT'S IT 
BUT DON'T DESPAIR 
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SPEND THIRTY GRAND ON A MUSTANG THAT LOOKS GOOD AND GOES FAST IN A STRAIGHT LINE 
THEN WHY NOT BUY THE ONE THAT HAS THE PEDIGREE AND THE HISTORY 
AND MAKES A GREAT NOISE 
BUY THIS ONE WELL NOT THIS ONE OBVIOUSLY IT'S A BIT DOWN ON POWER 
YOU'RE RIGHT YOU CANNOT PUT THAT MUCH POWER IN A CAR WITHOUT CHANGING THE SUSPENSION YOU JUST CAN'T 
OR THE BRAKES THE REST OF IT CAN'T HANDLE IT WE MUST NOW FIND OUT HOW FAST THE SHELBY GOES ON OUR TRACK 
WE PUT IT IN THE HANDS OF OUR TAME RACING DRIVER 
SOME SAY HE ISN'T MACHINE WASHABLE AND ALL HIS POTTED PLANTS ARE CALLED STEVE 
ALL WE KNOW IS HE'S CALLED THE STIG 
YOU CAN SEE THE BACK WHEELS BOBBING AROUND STRUGGLING FOR GRIP 
THAT'S THE LOW TECH SUSPENSION 
LET'S SEE HOW IT AFFECTS THINGS IN THE CORNERS LOOKING FAIRLY COMPOSED 
JUST A BIT LOOSE ON THE EXIT THERE 
GUIDING HIS HANDS SHE HELPED HIM TO UNBUTTON HER PRETTY LILAC BLOUSE 
MORE GUSHING FICTION FROM STIG'S COLLECTION THERE 
IT'S TRYING TO COCK A BACK WHEEL 
ALL OUT OF SHAPE THAT IS MESSY HAMMERHEAD NOW 
LURCHING OVER INTO THE TURNS STIG KICKS IT INTO A BIT OF A DRIFT 
IT'S NOT ELEGANT 
LOCKING HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK SHE SOFTLY PRESSED HER LIPS TO HIS 
CHANCE TO SEE THIS CAR AT ITS BEST NOW WHICH IS IN A STRAIGHT LINE 
FAST THROUGH THE TYRES 
TWO CORNERS LEFT WALLOWING ABOUT LIKE A FRISKY HIPPO THERE 
JUST GAMBON TO NEGOTIATE HE HURLS IT IN AND ACROSS THE LINE 
IT DID IT IN ONE MINUTE THIRTY EXACTLY 
YES WHICH IS GOOD BUT NOT YOU COULD SEE IT WOBBLING ABOUT 
STIG'S ALL OVER THE PLACE 
THAT BRINGS ME ON TO THIS THE ROUSH MUSTANG 
IT'S ONLY GOT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN BRAKE HORSEPOWER WHICH ISN'T AS MUCH AS THE SHELBY 
BUT THEY HAVE CHANGED THE SUSPENSION AND THE BRAKES 
I DROVE THIS LAST YEAR IN AMERICA 
AND IT WAS JUST BRI A REALLY PROPERLY BRILLIANT CAR 
BUT IF I'M RIGHT THIS IS TEN THOUSAND MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE SHELBY 
YES BUT IT'S TEN GRAND MORE CAR 
IN FACT EARLIER ON AFTER THE STIG HAD BEEN OUT IN THE SHELBY 
WE GAVE THIS TO HIM AND THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE 
HERE HE IS COMING UP TO WHERE IS HE NOW THAT'S CHICAGO 
THERE'S NO WOBBLING LIKE THERE IS IN THE SHELBY 
YOU GET THAT SUPER CHARGER WHINE THIS HAS A LIMITED SLIP DIFF WHICH THE SHELBY HASN'T 
SO IT DOESN'T JUST SPIN AWAY ALL THE POWER ON THE INSIDE WHEEL 
GOD THAT'S SUCH A NICE CAR 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE TIME WAS GO ON 
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN HORSEPOWER WHAT'S THIS FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY YEP 
IT WAS ONE TWENTY EIGHT WHOA 
ONE MINUTE TWENTY EIGHT SO IT'S TWO SECONDS FASTER THAN THE SHELBY 
BUT IT IS M. THREE MONEY 
YES BUT HONESTLY I'D HAVE ONE OF THOSE IF I WERE THE SORT OF PERSON WHO 
LOOKED AT MY SISTER AND THOUGHT H. M. M. 
EARLIER YOU SAW US BUY THREE NORMAL CARS AND TURN THEM INTO STRETCH LIMOUSINES 
THEN WE WENT DOWN TO OUR TEST TRACK FOR A SERIES OF CHALLENGES 
I HAVE TO SAY THAT JEREMY YOUR PANDA WAS RUBBISH MATE 
ABSOLUTE RUBBISH IT WASN'T BRILLIANT 
IT GOT THE MOST HITS IN THE ANTI TERRORIST TEST YES 
THEN IT WAS KNOCKED OUT BY A HOSEPIPE FOR THE FINAL CHALLENGE WE WERE TOLD TO 
SMARTEN OURSELVES UP BECAUSE WE WOULD BE CHAUFFEURING TOP CELEBRITIES 
TO THIS YEAR'S BRIT AWARDS 
YES AND THE WINNER WOULD BE THE PERSON WHO GET THE MOST PHOTOGRAPHS OF THEIR CELEBRITY 
IN THE FOLLOWING WEEK'S PAPERS AND MAGAZINES 
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED 
BEFORE BEING ALLOWED ON THE ROAD EACH OF OUR CARS HAD TO FACE A GOVERNMENT INSPECTION 
TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE ROAD LEGAL 
HAMMOND'S SAILED THROUGH NO PROBLEM 
AND SO AMAZINGLY DID MAY'S 
ME THOUGH I HAD A PROBLEM 
FOR SOME EXTRAORDINARY REASON THE RULES SAY YOU CAN'T DRIVE A FORTY SIX FOOT CAR ON THE PUBLIC HIGHWAYS 
SO I HAD TO DO SOME SURGERY 
I'VE HAD TO LOP SEVEN FEET OUT OF THE MIDDLE WHICH HAS AFFECTED THE REAR LEGROOM 
BUT IT IS NOW QUITE NIPPY COS IT'S ONLY EIGHT FEET LONGER THAN A BUS 
FOR MY PICK UP I HAD TO GO TO A HOTEL IN CHELSEA TO COLLECT A BRIT NOMINEE CALLED LEMAR 
HELLO 
MR. LEMAR OH YES 
MY NAME'S MAY I'M YOUR CHAUFFEUR FOR THE DAY O. K. 
THIS IS YOUR CAR 
IT'S AN ALFA SAAB 
MEANWHILE I'D BEEN SENT TO E. M. I. RECORDS IN WEST LONDON 
JUST GOT A BIT OF DENT IT'LL POLISH OUT 
EVERYONE'S A CRITIC 
AND MY V. I. P. PICK UP WAS R'N'B STAR JAMELIA 
OH MY GOD 
O. K. NO EXPENSE SPENT 
WHILST HAMMOND GOT THE GLAMOROUS SINGER I HAD TO PICK UP A FAT MAN 
OH GOD 
IT'S CHRIS MOYLES FROM RADIO ONE 
THIS IS YOUR LUXURY LIMOUSINE 
IT'S NOT WHAT I HAD IN MIND 
RIGHT HERE WE GO SIT BACK AND RELAX 
OH WHY'S IT DOING THAT 
O. K. IF YOU'D LIKE TO STEP IN THAT'LL BE GREAT AND WE CAN GET OFF 
WHAT 
THIS IS THE INTERCOM YOU PRESS THAT BUTTON IF YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME 
IF IT STARTS TO RAIN DON'T PRESS IT COS YOU'LL GET ELECTROCUTED 
EVENTUALLY THOUGH ALL OUR PASSENGERS WERE ON BOARD AND WE WERE READY 
ARE YOU COMFORTABLE 
NO 
GOOD GOD 
WE WERE ALL NOW HEADING FOR EARLS COURT 
THE BRITS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST NIGHTS IN THE SHOW BIZ CALENDAR 
WITH MOST CELEBS HOPING TO LOOK IMPRESSIVE BY ARRIVING IN A BIG SHINY GERMAN CAR 
WE WERE GOING TO SHOW THEM THE ERROR OF THEIR WAYS 
IT'S BETTER THAN AN AUDI THIS WILL GET YOU NOTICED 
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO DAVE LEE TRAVIS HE'S ON THREE COUNTIES RADIO 
COS HE DIDN'T THINK TO USE CARS LIKE THIS GOING TO AWARDS CEREMONIES 
I'VE CHOSEN THIS ROUTE TO DEMONSTRATE THE BRILLIANCE OF MY CAR 
MEANWHILE IN THE ALFAAB LEMAR WAS RIVETED BY JAMES' CONVERSATION 
THERE IS A SMALL ISSUE WITH THE CONGESTION CHARGE BECAUSE 
THE CAMERA RECORDS THE REAR VIEW OF THE CAR BUT WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE PHOTOGRAPHS 
IT WILL GIVE THE REGISTRATION END OF THE SAAB BUT THE PHOTOGRAPH WILL SHOW THE FRONT OF AN ALFA 
SO IT WILL LOOK AS THOUGH SOMEBODY WITH THE WRONG SORT OF CAR 
FOR THE NUMBER PLATE HAS REVERSED INTO LONDON 
BACK IN THE PANDA MY DEMONSTRATION OF ITS BRILLIANCE WASN'T GOING TOO WELL 
OOH 
YOU'RE CRUNCHING IT OH 
IT'S STILL STANDING 
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT WE CAN EDIT THAT BIT OUT 
SO WHEN THE DIGITAL CAMERA TAKES A PICTURE IT THINKS THAT'S A SAAB 
WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE PHOTO THEY'LL SEE AN ALFA ROMEO GOING THE WRONG WAY 
HYDE PARK ON THE LEFT THERE SIR 
IN THE M. G. POOR OLD JAMELIA WAS ATTRACTING A LOT OF ATTENTION FROM FANS 
NOT LEAST BECAUSE HAMMOND HAD HAD TO MODIFY HIS INTERCOM TO MAKE IT LEGAL 
SORRY ABOUT THE FAN TRYING TO CHAT YOU UP THAT WAS A BIT AWKWARD 
I CAN'T HEAR YOU 
OH 
SO JAMELIA WAS EMBARRASSED IN THE M. G. 
LEMAR WAS BORED IN THE ALFAAB 
AND CHRIS HAD YET TO APPRECIATE THE PANDA'S BRILLIANCE 
THAT IS A CATASTROPHE THAT'S JUST HAPPENED 
IS THAT CAR BEHIND ME VERY CLOSE 
YES 
AND THEN LEMAR WOKE UP AS HE BEGAN TO REALISE THAT JAMES HAD NO IDEA WHERE HE WAS GOING 
THE CAR DOESN'T HAVE NAVIGATION IN IT I TAKE IT 
IT HAS NAVIGATION OF SORTS IN THAT IT HAS A DRIVER WHO'S LIVED IN LONDON FOR TWENTY YEARS TWENTY ONE IN FACT 
WHERE ARE WE NOW 
WE'RE JUST COMING ON TO ERM ER 
ERM 
TO DISTRACT CHRIS FROM THE FACT THAT WE WERE ALMOST CONSTANTLY STUCK 
I ENGAGED HIM IN SOME MUSICAL SMALL TALK 
I ONCE WENT TO EARLS COURT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX AND SAW BAD COMPANY THERE 
SIMON KIRKE DID A DRUM SOLO LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE 
IT WAS NOW SIX O'CLOCK LEMAR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AT THE BRITS IN HALF AN HOUR 
AND JAMES WAS MILES AWAY STUCK IN THE SIDE STREETS OF CENTRAL LONDON 
ACTUALLY IF YOU DON'T MIND SIR THIS IS WHERE I NEED YOUR HELP 
BECAUSE THE REASON THIS CAR WILL GO ROUND VERY SMALL CORNERS IS BECAUSE YOU CAN STEER IT FROM BOTH ENDS 
BUT I'D HAVE TO ASK YOU TO SIT IN THE ALFA ROMEO AND STEER 
BY THIS STAGE MOYLES WAS HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND BECAUSE 
I HADN'T THOUGHT TO INCLUDE ANY ON BOARD CATERING HE'D BEEN SHOPPING FOR SUPPLIES 
WHAT WAS THAT 
I WAS GETTING ON MY SEAT I THOUGHT SOMEONE HAD RUN INTO US 
TURN LEFT RIGHT LEFT YOUR LEFT 
MY LEFT YEP 
THAT'S IT THAT'S PERFECT STRAIGHT AROUND THAT VERY TIGHT BEND 
A NORMAL LIMOUSINE WOULDN'T GO ROUND LIKE THAT LET'S DO ANOTHER ONE 
LEFT SIR 
O. K. SO THIS THE WHOLE THING IS NOT 
YOU NEED TO STRAIGHTEN UP WE'RE CRABBING RATHER BADLY 
I CAN'T BECAUSE THE OLD WHEEL THING IS A BIT 
JAMELIA WAS CLOSER TO EARLS COURT THAN LEMAR BUT NO HAPPIER 
THE ACCELERATOR IS STUCK OPEN A BIT 
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT I HAD TO LINK IT TO THE BACK OF THE CAR 
ITS HYDRO GAS SUSPENSION AND THE CLUTCH AND THE BRAKES 
OH HANG ON 
THAT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD 
THAT'S 
WHOA SORRY 
ROAD CLOSED I'D BETTER GO RIGHT 
AND THEN IT GOT WORSE 
THAT'S NOT GONE WELL HAS IT 
WHERE ARE YOU GOING 
YOU'RE GOING THAT WAY RIGHT SORRY 
SORRY 
OH MY GOD YOU'RE THE WORST DRIVER SORRY 
THAT'S THE FAMOUS HARRODS DEPARTMENT STORE ON THE LEFT 
YOU KNOW EARLIER WHEN I WAS TALKING ABOUT CIRCLES 
HARRODS SEEN IT TWICE KNOW WHAT I MEAN I DON'T NEED TO SEE IT A THIRD TIME 
THE BUS COULDN'T BACK UP AND I WAS STUCK ON A DOUBLE MINI ROUNDABOUT 
I CAN'T MAKE THIS TURN CHRIS AT ALL 
LOOK WHERE YOU'RE GOING 
WHOA SORRY 
THANK YOU 
WE'RE CLEAR 
EARLS COURT WAS JUST MINUTES AWAY 
WHAT WAS THAT NOISE 
AT THE BRITS THE WORLD'S MEDIA WERE WAITING FOR JAMELIA'S ARRIVAL 
I DON'T THINK YOU APPRECIATE THE COMPLEXITY OF LINKING UP A REAR ENGINE CAR WHEN YOU'VE STRETCHED IT 
PLEASE RICHARD LET ME GET OUT HERE 
NO RED CARPET IT IS FOR YOU 
I'M SO EMBARRASSED 
AND SHE WASN'T TOO PLEASED WITH MY CLEVER EXIT SOLUTION 
ON THE OTHER SIDE ON THE OTHER SIDE 
SORRY ABOUT THE LADDER THING THE STEPS WEREN'T IDEAL 
WHILST JAMELIA REGAINED HER COMPOSURE I CHECKED ON THE OTHERS' 
JEREMY HOW YOU DOING

EH 
FIRST TIME I'M NOMINATED BEST MALE 
BEST MALE LEMAR 
SURELY SIR IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS IT'S FASHIONABLE TO BE QUITE LATE NOBODY EVER TURNS UP ON TIME 
THERE'S FASHIONABLY LATE AND THERE'S STUPIDLY LATE 
I CAN ONLY APOLOGISE SIR 
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING PLEASE JUST GET ME THERE 
WELL THERE'S FIVE MINUTES TO GO MAY'S HOPELESSLY LOST 
JEREMY'S CAR IS SPLIT IN HALF 
THAT MEANS BY DEFAULT IF NOTHING ELSE 
I AM THE WINNER YAH 
HAMMOND MAY HAVE BEEN GLOATING BUT I WASN'T OUT OF THE COMPETITION YET 
WHAT TIME DO THE AWARDS START 
ABOUT FIVE MINUTES 
OH WAIT WAIT WAIT 
DIGNITY DIGNITY YEAH DIGNITY

SO MOYLES WAS HAPPY BUT HAMMOND WASN'T 
YOU CHEATED YOU FINISHED WITH HALF A CAR 
IT'S STILL A STRETCH I GOT THE MAN HERE 
MEANWHILE IN A CAR SOMEWHERE NOWHERE NEAR EARLS COURT 
LEMAR ACKNOWLEDGED AS ONE OF THE GENTLEMEN OF POP HAD HAD ENOUGH 
STRICTLY SPEAKING IT'S LEFT BUT I THINK IF WE GO RIGHT I CAN GO AROUND THE BACK 
WHAT D'YOU MEAN RIGHT 
RIGHT WHY YOU'VE JUST SAID NO LISTEN YOU JUST SAID GO LEFT RIGHT 
MOST PEOPLE WOULD GO LEFT 
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST FOLLOW WHAT MOST PEOPLE DO 
BECAUSE I THINK IF WE GO RIGHT 
ARE YOU DOING THIS INTENTIONALLY NOW THIS IS JUST STUPID ARE YOU A JERK 
NO BUT HAVE YOU COME TO MESS UP MY DAY YOU PICK ME UP 
YOU'VE DRIVEN ME ROUND IN CIRCLES IN LONDON 
YOU'VE PASSED HARRODS ELEVEN OR A ONE HUNDRED TIMES NOW 
IT'S LEFT YOU'RE TELLING ME TO GO RIGHT I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANY MORE OPEN THIS DAMN DOOR 
STUPID DOOR I'VE HAD IT FORGET IT 
LEMAR GOT LIKE THAT AFTER HALF A DAY WE HAVE TO WORK WITH HIM ALL THE TIME I KNOW
