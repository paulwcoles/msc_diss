WELCOME TO SEE HEAR 
WHAT QUALITIES AND TALENTS CATAPULT YOU TO THE TOP OF YOUR PROFESSION 
WHO ARE THE DEAF PEOPLE WHO ARE BREAKING THROUGH 
TODAY WE'RE AT SAINT PANCRAS STATION IN LONDON 
A SYMBOL OF A BOLD INNOVATIVE VISION FOR THE FUTURE 
IN THIS PROGRAMME WE PROFILE FOUR INNOVATIVE PEOPLE 
WE HAVE CHOSEN AS DEAF TALENT TO WATCH IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
AT TWENTY TWO MANAGING HALF A BILLION U. S. DOLLARS THAT'S A HUGE AMOUNT 
THE AIM OF SCHOOL OF SIGN LANGUAGE 
IS TO BREAK DOWN COMMUNICATION BARRIERS 
BETWEEN DEAF PEOPLE AND THE HEARING COMMUNITY 
AND ALSO RAISE THE AWARENESS OF DEAF PEOPLE AND THEIR LANGUAGE 
I LOVE TECHNOLOGY AND I. B. M. LOVE DIVERSITY AND TECHNOLOGY 
THEREFORE WE ARE A PERFECT MATCH 
JUST ACTING JUST DOING WHAT I LOVE 
THEN COMING OFF AND PEOPLE SAYING 
THE GROOMING STARTS WHERE YOU MEET THEM AND THEY ARE NICE TO YOU 
I WAS FLATTERED AT FIRST BECAUSE OLDER BOYS WERE INTERESTED IN YOU 
AT THIRTEEN IT'S NICE 
THEN YOU MEET THE COUSINS AND THE BROTHERS AND THEY START TO GET OLDER 
YOU REALISE YOU'VE BEEN PASSED ON BECAUSE YOU HANG AROUND WITH OLDER PEOPLE 
THEY START TO TOUCH YOU AND SAY SEXUAL THINGS TO YOU AND THE ABUSE STARTS 
I WAS PINNED DOWN BY TWO OTHER MEN WHILE THEY RAPED ME AND THERE WERE OTHER MEN WATCHING 
AFTER THE RAPE JANE WAS TOO SCARED TO TELL HER PARENTS 
SHE KNEW VIRTUALLY NOTHING ABOUT THE GANG 
THEY KNEW ALMOST EVERY DETAIL OF HER LIFE WHICH THEY USED TO FORCE HER TO GO BACK 
THEY WOULD SEND YOU TEXTS AND SAY YOU HAVE TO COME DOWN NOW 
IF YOU DON'T COME DOWN THEN WE'LL COME AND GET YOU FROM THE HOUSE 
YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO HURT YOUR FAMILY IT'S LIKE YOU'RE PROTECTING YOUR FAMILY BY GOING 
THEY THREATENED YOU WITH WHAT 
THINGS LIKE THEY WOULD BURN MY HOUSE AND GANG RAPE ME MUM AND MAKE ME WATCH 
ALL SORTS OF THINGS 
WITHIN WEEKS JANE WAS TRAPPED AND PIMPED 
SHE WAS MADE TO HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX WITH A SUCCESSION OF MEN 
IT COME TO A POINT WHERE IT WERE NORMAL AND SEX DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING REALLY 
HOW OFTEN WAS THIS HAPPENING 
NEARLY EVERY NIGHT 
HOW MANY MEN WERE INVOLVED 
THERE WERE LOADS OF MEN INVOLVED 
YOU COULDN'T KEEP COUNT 
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO KEEP COUNT 
THE HARDEST THING TO UNDERSTAND IS WHY JANE AND GIRLS LIKE HER WOULD KEEP GOING BACK 
THE GANGS HAVE A SECRET WEAPON 
THEY'RE NOT ONLY PIMPS 
MANY ARE ALSO DRUG DEALERS 
THEY'D INTRODUCE YOU TO CANNABIS AND ALCOHOL AND THEN AFTER YOU'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR A WHILE 
THEY WOULD WANT YOU TO TAKE ECSTASY TABLETS OR COCAINE 
AND THEN THEY WOULD WANT TO GET YOU INTO HEROIN OR CRACK COCAINE 
YOUR DEBT BUILDS UP BECAUSE THEY SUPPLY YOUR DRUGS 
YOU DON'T PAY FOR THEM YOU HAVE SEX TO PAY FOR YOUR DRUGS 
THE SCALE OF JANE'S SUPPOSED DEBT WAS HUGE 
AT ONE STAGE SHE WAS TOLD BY THE GANG THAT SHE OWED THEM THREE HUNDRED FOR FOUR CANS OF LAGER 
THREE HUNDRED SHE'D HAVE TO WORK OFF 
THROUGH ALL THIS JANE'S FAMILY SAY THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON 
ACROSS THE PENNINES THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH CONCERN IN BLACKBURN 
THAT THE POLICE SET UP A DEDICATED UNIT OPERATION ENGAGE 
ITS FIRST MAJOR CASE CAUGHT TWO MEN WITH A HISTORY OF PREYING ON TEENAGERS IN CARE 
ON THIS STREET THERE'S A HOUSE WHERE TWO YOUNGSTERS WERE BROUGHT 
ON A REGULAR BASIS 
AND GIVEN ALCOHOL DRUGS ECSTASY PILLS AND SEXUALLY ABUSED 
DURING THE NIGHT THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT HOW LONG DID IT GO ON FOR 
OVER A THREE MONTH PERIOD THEY WERE BROUGHT ON A DAILY BASIS 
HOW MANY MEN WERE INVOLVED IN THIS ABUSE 
TWO MEN PERMANENTLY RESIDED AT THE ADDRESS 
THERE WOULD BE MEN THAT VISIT 
WE KNOW OF TWO MEN WHO USED TO COME REGULARLY 
AND THIS HAPPENED FREQUENTLY 
YES WE THINK IT HAPPENED ON A DAILY BASIS 
THE TWO MEN VISITING THE FLAT FOR SEX WERE QAISER NAVEED AGED THIRTY TWO 
AND ZULFQAR HUSSAIN FORTY SIX 
THEIR VICTIMS WERE GIRLS JUST FOURTEEN WHO WE HAVE NAMED LINDSAY AND FIONA 
IN BOTH CASES THEIR PARENTS HAD NO IDEA 
OF THE REASON FOR THE HUGE CHANGES THEY'D SEEN IN THEIR CHILDREN 
THE FIRST THING SHE USED TO STOP OUT ALL NIGHT 
WHICH WAS VERY UNUSUAL FOR HER SHE ALWAYS CAME HOME ON TIME 
SHE WOULD BE ABUSIVE IN THE HOME TO US ALL 
I USED TO LOCK THE WINDOWS AND THE DOORS TO TRY AND KEEP HER IN 
SHE WOULD SMASH THE WINDOWS CLIMB OUT THE WINDOWS UNLOCK DOORS SHE WOULD GET OUT NO MATTER WHAT 
JUST HER COMPLETE OUTLOOK ON EVERYTHING CHANGED 
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW US 
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW US AS A FAMILY 
PANORAMA HAS INTERVIEWED THE OTHER GIRL IN THE CASE LINDSAY WHO IS STILL ONLY SIXTEEN 
FOR PROTECTION HER WORDS ARE SPOKEN BY AN ACTRESS 
I FIRST MET ZULFI AND QAIS IN A TAKEAWAY 
IT WAS GREAT AT FIRST THEY WOULD GIVE US CANS OF LAGER ECSTASY COCAINE STUFF LIKE THAT 
BUT WE KNEW THEY'D EXPECT SOMETHING IN RETURN LIKE SEX 
ZULFI USED TO SAY NO SHAG NO FAG 
HE THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY BUT WE KNEW WHAT HE MEANT 
AND WE DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT 
THE GIRLS' PARENTS WERE DISTRAUGHT 
CONCERNED BY HER DAUGHTER STAYING OUT AND HAVING SEX SO YOUNG 
MEGAN TURNED EVERYWHERE SHE COULD THINK OF FOR HELP 
WHEN YOU APPROACHED THE AUTHORITIES POLICE SOCIAL SERVICES DID YOU GET A GOOD RESPONSE IMMEDIATELY 
NOT AT ALL I HAD TO KEEP GOING BACK TO THEM DAILY 
RINGING THEM UP THREE OR FOUR TIMES A DAY 
I NEVER STOPPED RINGING BEGGING FOR HELP EVENTUALLY I DID GET THE HELP 
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE IT TOOK ABOUT THREE MONTHS 
THREE MONTHS YES 
BLACKBURN SOCIAL SERVICES SAY THEY DID ALL THEY COULD TO KEEP FIONA 
SAFE AT HOME BUT EVENTUALLY HAD TO TAKE HER INTO CARE 
THEY DON'T ACCEPT THIS TOOK THREE MONTHS 
BUT DO SAY THEY FACED A STEEP LEARNING CURVE OVER SEXUAL EXPLOITATION 
WHEN A YOUNG PERSON IS IDENTIFIED AS BEING SEXUALLY EXPLOITED 
OFTEN THE RESPONSE ESPECIALLY FROM SOCIAL SERVICES WILL BE VERY SLOW 
IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE BUT IN SOME AREAS THE RESPONSE IS INADEQUATE 
THIS NEEDS URGENT INTERVENTION AS SOON AS THE FIRST SIGNS ARE IDENTIFIED 
THE MOST SERIOUS WAY A SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT CAN GET INVOLVED 
IS TO TAKE A CHILD INTO CARE THEN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE KEPT NOT ONLY SAFE BUT UNDER CONTROL 
BUT THAT CAN BE AN ILLUSION 
LINDSAY THE OTHER FOURTEEN YEAR OLD IN THE CASE WAS ALREADY IN CARE 
AND LIVING PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO HER ABUSERS AND MORE ABLE THAN EVER TO CARRY ON RUNNING WILD 
I LOVE BEING IN CARE 
IT'S LIKE YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT 
THEY CAN'T STOP YOU OR LOCK YOU IN 
THEY CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT TO DO LIKE YOUR MUM AND DAD WOULD 
LINDSAY'S FRIEND FIONA WAS EVENTUALLY MOVED TO SPECIALIST CARE ONE HUNDRED MILES AWAY IN NORTH WALES 
THE IDEA WAS TO GET HER AWAY FROM THE ABUSE AND GIVE HER A CHANCE TO REBUILD HER LIFE 
WITHIN A WEEK THE TWO MEN TRACKED HER DOWN AND WENT TO ABDUCT HER 
THIS WAS TO PROVE A TURNING POINT IN THE CASE 
THEY TOOK LINDSAY WITH THEM FROM HER CARE HOME IN BLACKBURN 
THEY WENT TO NORTH WALES COLLECTED THE OTHER FOURTEEN YEAR OLD AND WERE BROUGHT BACK TO THE BLACKBURN AREA 
WHERE THEY WERE SUPPLIED WITH ECSTASY TABLETS AND ENGAGED IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH THE MALES 
WHY DID THAT PROVE THE TURNING POINT 
AFTER THIS EVENT THE GIRLS THE VICTIMS WERE WILLING TO TELL ME AND DISCLOSE OFFENCES AGAINST THEM 
UP UNTIL THEN WHEN I'D CONDUCTED RETURN TO HOME INTERVIEWS WITH THEM 
THEY WOULDN'T PROVIDE INFORMATION THEY DIDN'T SEE THEMSELVES AS VICTIMS BUT SUDDENLY THEY DID YEAH 
IT WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT TO THEM 
FOLLOWING THIS ABDUCTION AND FURTHER ABUSE 
THE GIRLS REALISED THE DANGER THEY WERE IN ESPECIALLY WHEN THE MEN TURNED VIOLENT 
THE TIME THAT ZULFI ATTACKED FIONA WAS THE WORST 
I REMEMBER HEARING HER SCREAMING COS HE WAS WHACKING HER WITH A METAL BAR 
I RAN IN AND GRABBED IT OFF HIM AND HE WAS SCREAMING AT HER BECAUSE SHE WOULDN'T HAVE SEX WITH HIM 
IN THE END SHE HAD SEX JUST TO KEEP HIM QUIET 
FACED WITH THE EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM 
THE MEN FINALLY PLEADED GUILTY TO ABDUCTION HAVING SEX WITH CHILDREN AND GIVING THEM CLASS A DRUGS 
LAST AUGUST THEY EACH GOT PRISON SENTENCES OF ALMOST SIX YEARS 
CHILDREN TAKEN INTO CARE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTED BY THE AUTHORITIES 
BUT THE REALITY IS THE ONLY WAY TO BE SURE THEY CAN'T BE GOT AT BY ABUSERS 
IS TO PUT THE CHILDREN IN SECURE ACCOMMODATION EFFECTIVELY LOCKING THEM UP OUT OF HARM'S WAY 
WE'VE LEARNED THAT THIS HAS NOW HAPPENED TO ONE OF THE GIRLS IN THE CASE 
THE PROBLEM IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO GETS PUNISHED IS THE VICTIM 
POLICE IN BLACKBURN HAVE BEEN ALERTED TO OTHER CASES OF CHILDREN BEING SEXUALLY ABUSED 
BUT THIS SECRETIVE CRIMINAL WORLD MAKES IT HARD TO GATHER EVIDENCE 
WITH FEW VICTIMS TURNING TO THE POLICE FOR HELP 
OFFICERS HERE GO TO KNOWN PICK UP POINTS LOOKING FOR GIRLS AT RISK OF GROOMING INTO PROSTITUTION 
ON SATURDAY EVENING SERGEANT WHEELAN AND P. C. MCDERMOTT 
COME ACROSS A YOUNG GIRL ON HER OWN AND LOOKING VULNERABLE 
HELLO ARE YOU ALL RIGHT 
WE'RE POLICE ARE YOU ALL RIGHT 
YEAH I'M WAITING FOR SOMEBODY YOU LOOK FREEZING 
HOW OLD ARE YOU FIFTEEN 
FIFTEEN ARE YOU WAITING FOR YOUR MATES 
YEAH WHAT DO YOU WANT WE JUST WANT TO KNOW YOU ARE ALL RIGHT 
I AM ALL RIGHT WE'RE POLICE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE SAFE AND HOW OLD YOU ARE 
ARE YOU WAITING FOR YOUR DAD HAVE YOU JUST BEEN TO THE CINEMA 
WITHIN A MINUTE SHE'S CHANGED HER STORY FROM BEING AT THE PICTURES 
TO BEING WITH HER BOYFRIEND IN AN ASIAN AREA 
HER DAD'S COMING TO PICK HER UP SHE'D BEEN TO SEE HER BOYFRIEND ADAM 
ADAM WHO YOU DON'T KNOW HIS LAST NAME HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN GOING OUT WITH HIM THREE WEEKS 
NO WE'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE YOU UNLESS WE THINK YOU ARE SAFE 
THE POLICE ARE SUSPICIOUS THEY HAVE INTELLIGENCE THAT AN ASIAN MAN USING THIS NAME HAS BEEN GROOMING GIRLS 
POLICE ARE MORE WORRIED WHEN SHE REFUSES TO GIVE ANY MORE INFORMATION 
I'M O. K. I'M GONNA GET THE BUS 
SHE'S GONNA GET THE BUS O. K. 
STILL CONCERNED THE POLICE FOLLOW HER AND WANT TO CONTACT HER FAMILY 
YOU GIVE ME YOUR HOME TELEPHONE NUMBER I WILL RING YOUR DAD 
I DON'T KNOW IT I DON'T HAVE A DAD WELL WE'LL RING YOUR MUM RIGHT 
THEY MANAGE TO GET WHAT SHE SAYS IS HER MUM'S PHONE NUMBER BUT THE GIRL THEN SUDDENLY CHANGES HER NAME 
WE'RE JUST WITH YOUR DAUGHTER NOW 
SORRY JUST A SECOND SHE'S CALLED IS IT 
YEAH HOW OLD IS 
SHE'S HOW OLD 
SIXTEEN 
NOW HER AGE HAS CHANGED 
IS SHE ALLOWED OUT AT THE MOMENT WE JUST WANTED TO CHECK SHE WAS SAFE AND SHE WASN'T A MISSING PERSON 
NONE OF THIS HANGS TOGETHER BUT WITH WHAT SEEMS TO BE HER MOTHER SAYING SHE'S OUT WITH HER CONSENT 
THERE IS LITTLE THE POLICE FEEL THEY CAN DO SO THEY GIVE UP 
THAT WAS A TYPICAL SCENARIO OF A YOUNG GIRL ON HER OWN DOESN'T TELL YOU THE FULL STORY 
YOU JUST HAVE TO QUESTION THEM FURTHER AND 
A CAR COULD HAVE TURNED UP ASKED HER TO JUMP IN AND SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN AND AWAY 
WE HAD TO STOP AND SPEAK TO HER 
THAT WAS A BAD ONE WHAT CAN YOU DO 
YOU WANT TO TAKE HOLD OF THEM WELL I KNOW 
THE AUTHORITIES ARE ALREADY ALERT TO THE DANGER POSED BY INDIVIDUAL PAEDOPHILES 
NOW THEY'RE CONCERNED THAT EVIDENCE FROM SOME COMMUNITIES POINTS TO AN EVEN MORE SINISTER THREAT 
ORGANISED SEXUAL EXPLOYATION OF CHILDREN BY RUTHLESS CRIMINAL GANGS 
AS THE COST OF DRUGS HAS FALLEN OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS 
THEY'VE SEEN A FALL IN THEIR INCOME OF A HALF 
TO FILL THAT THEY HAVE TURNED TO OTHER METHODS 
ONE OF THE PRIMARY METHODS IS TO GET YOUNG WHITE TEENAGE GIRLS INTO PROSTITUTION 
BIG MONEY VERY BIG MONEY 
ONE PROSTITUTE COULD CHARGE UP TO TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED IT IS AN EVIL TRADE 
THERE'S A HUGE DEMAND OUT THERE FROM EVIL PEOPLE AND THESE DRUG DEALERS ARE TRYING TO FILL THAT DEMAND 
I WAS TAKEN TO A FLAT AND SHUT IN THE BEDROOM 
I HAD TO PERFORM SEXUAL ACTS ON MEN 
THEY'D LIKE ONE WOULD COME IN DO WHATEVER HE WANTED TO DO GO OUT AND ANOTHER WOULD COME IN 
THEY WERE LIKE A CONVEYOR BELT 
IT WAS AS THOUGH LIKE 
IT WAS EASY TO DO IT THEN GET HOME THAN TO NOT DO IT AND NOT GET HOME 
HOW MANY MEN WERE INVOLVED THAT DAY THERE WERE FIVE 
WERE YOU GETTING PAID FOR ANY OF THIS 
NO YOU NEVER SAW ANY MONEY 
YOU NEVER SAW ANY MONEY EXCHANGING 
WAS MONEY CHANGING HANDS 
YEAH 
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN TOLD LIKE 
THEY'D SAY SMART COMMENTS LIKE OH THANKS FOR DOING US THAT FAVOUR THE OTHER DAY I GOT TWO HUNDRED FOR THAT 
TWO HUNDRED 
AND YOU WEREN'T SEEING ANY OF IT NO 
THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND 
IT IS ORCHESTRATED IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY SOME OF THE TIME 
BY CRIMINAL NETWORKS 
BY INDIVIDUAL PIMPS 
WHO MIGHT WORK WITH OTHER COLLEAGUES IN OTHER TOWNS 
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE YOUNGER THE WOMEN THE HIGHER THE PRICE 
SO WHAT THE PIMP AND ALL THE CRIMINAL NETWORK RECEIVES 
ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT MONIES 
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS 
TENS OF THOUSANDS A YEAR 
OR MORE WELL I'D HAVE THOUGHT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THAT 
WE BELIEVE FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT WE HEAR FROM PARENTS 
ABOUT THE MEN WHO ARE EXPLOITING THEIR CHILDREN THAT IT IS HIGHLY ORGANISED 
WE ASK PARENTS TO KEEP RECORDS ANY INFORMATION THAT THEY RECEIVE ABOUT THE MEN INVOLVED 
AND WHEN WE GO INTO A SPECIFIC AREA WHERE WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PARENTS RECORDING THE INFORMATION 
IT WILL OFTEN ALL INTERLINK SO IT WILL BE THE SAME MEN EXPLOITING THE YOUNG PEOPLE 
THE NAMES WILL BE THE SAME OFTEN NICKNAMES ADMITTEDLY 
BUT A LOT OF THE NAMES AND PHONE NUMBERS WILL BE THE SAME 
IT WILL ALL LINK UP THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE IT IS ORGANISED 
POLICE HAVE HAD SUCCESS IN BREAKING UP GANGS WHO HAVE TRAFFICKED YOUNG WOMEN INTO THE U. K. FOR THE SEX TRADE 
AND GROOMING OF CHILDREN BY PREDATORS ON THE INTERNET HAS GAINED ATTENTION 
BUT IN MOST CASES THOSE OFFENDERS NEVER GET TO MEET THEIR VICTIMS 
BRITISH GIRLS BEING MOVED AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR ABUSE THAT ISN'T VIRTUAL BUT VERY REAL 
HAS ATTRACTED ALMOST NO ATTENTION AND NOT A SINGLE PROSECUTION 
THE HOME OFFICE RECENTLY SAID 
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST INTERNAL TRAFFICKING IS A BIG PROBLEM IN THE U. K. 
IT IS A RELATIVELY NEW FORM OF ORGANISED CRIME THAT IS NOW COMING TO OUR ATTENTION 
IF THE PIMPING OF YOUNG TEENAGERS IS LARGELY A HIDDEN CRIME 
IT HAS NOT YET RECEIVED THE NATIONAL PRIORITY SOME EXPERTS ARGUE IT MERITS 
IT DOESN'T FOR EXAMPLE FEATURE IN THE GOVERNMENT'S LIST OF TARGETS FOR THE POLICE 
THEY EMPHASISE BURGLARY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE GUN CRIME 
A NUMBER OF OTHER OFFENCES AND ROAD TRAFFIC COLLISIONS 
BUT NOT CHILD PROSTITUTION 
IT HAS TO FIGHT FOR AIR SPACE 
AMONG A PLETHORA OF OTHER CHALLENGES AND PRIORITIES FOR THE POLICE 
CERTAINLY IF FORCES DON'T HAVE INTELLIGENCE ABOUT A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM EXISTING IN THEIR AREA 
THEY ARE NOT LIKELY TO INCLUDE IT AS PART OF THEIR POLICING PLAN PRIORITIES 
IS IT GETTING ADEQUATE PRIORITY NATIONALLY AT THE MOMENT 
IT'S GETTING THE PRIORITY IT NEEDS WHEN INSTANCES COME TO LIGHT 
OUTSIDE LANCASHIRE THERE HAVE BEEN SHORT TERM POLICE OPERATIONS AGAINST CHILD SEXUAL EXPLOITATION 
WHEN THEY HAVE ENDED MANY HAVE DRAWN THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN SOLVED 
IT JUST AGAIN HIGHLIGHTS THE FACT THAT THIS PROBLEM IS SEEMINGLY NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND NOT UNDERSTOOD 
BECAUSE IF IT WAS UNDERSTOOD PEOPLE IN AUTHORITY WOULD REALISE 
THAT THIS IS LONG TERM WORK YOU CAN'T JUST PUT OPERATIONS IN AND RESOURCES IN AND THEN PULL THEM OUT 
IT NEEDS TO BE LONG TERM INVESTMENT 
FROM ALL THE ORGANISATIONS INVOLVED IF THIS IS GOING TO HAVE ANY LONG TERM IMPACT 
THESE MEN ARE IN IT FOR THE LONG RUN THEY'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE 
AND WE NEED TO BE IN IT FOR THE LONG RUN SO WE CAN PROTECT THESE CHILDREN 
YOU HAVE HAD YOUR EYE OFF THE BALL AS FAR AS CHILD PROSTITUTION IS CONCERNED I DON'T THINK SO 
WHY WASN'T IT A TARGET IF ROAD COLLISIONS WERE 
WE'VE INTRODUCED NEW OFFENCES ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT UNITS 
GUIDANCE HAS GONE OUT TO THE POLICE THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE 
IN THE WAY VICTIMS ARE DEALT WITH WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN COLLECT EVIDENCE AS PART OF THAT PROCESS 
THE GOVERNMENT IS TURNING ITS ATTENTION IN TERMS OF TARGETS AND PRIORITIES TO SERIOUS VIOLENCE 
WHEN WILL THE GOVERNMENT MAKE THE PIMPING OF CHILDREN A STATUTORY POLICE TARGET 
BUT THE HOME OFFICE HAS KNOWN ABOUT THE PROBLEM FOR YEARS 
A DECADE AGO OFFICIALS WERE SO CONCERNED ABOUT CHILD PROSTITUTION 
THAT THEY FUNDED POLICE AND SOCIAL SERVICES PROJECTS IN WOLVERHAMPTON AND NOTTINGHAM 
TO LEARN HOW TO TACKLE IT IN WOLVERHAMPTON THE TEAM WAS LED BY DETECTIVE SERGEANT LYNDON WHITEHOUSE 
WHO WAS INITIALLY SCEPTICAL ABOUT THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM 
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ANYWHERE NEAR AS SERIOUS AS WHAT WE UNCOVERED 
I WAS NOT OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT THAT PIMPS ARE IN EXISTENCE 
AND THAT PIMPS WOULD BE INVOLVED WITH CHILDREN 
BUT I DIDN'T REALISE IT WAS ON ANYWHERE NEAR THE SCALE IT WAS AT THE TIME 
SHOCKED AT WHAT HE'D FOUND HE SET ABOUT BRINGING THE GUILTY TO JUSTICE 
IN THE LIMITED TIME THE PILOT PROJECT WAS ALLOWED TO RUN THE RESULTS WERE EXTRAORDINARY 
OVER EIGHTEEN MONTHS WE INVESTIGATED NINETY ONE CASES 
IN SEVENTY ONE WE UNCOVERED EVIDENCE OF COERCION AND EXPLOITATION 
IN THIRTY FIVE CASES WE BROUGHT A PROSECUTION 
THIRTY FIVE INDIVIDUAL ADULTS WERE CHARGED WITH OFFENCES 
IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN FOR PROSTITUTION 
AND VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE PEOPLE WERE CONVICTED 
YOU GOT ALMOST THIRTY FIVE 
CONVICTED MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE RECEIVED CUSTODIAL SENTENCES 
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY IT IS A SERIOUS CRIME 
HIS TEAM SHOWED HOW THESE CRIMES COULD BE TACKLED IN WOLVERHAMPTON AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY 
AS THEY TRACKED GANGS TAKING GIRLS FROM CITY TO CITY 
THEY WERE BEING MOVED AROUND THE COUNTRY AND PIMPS HAD GOT A NETWORK 
AND KNEW OTHER PIMPS IN OTHER AREAS HOW FAR WOULD THEY MOVE 
OUR INVESTIGATIONS TOOK US I PERSONALLY TRAVELLED TO LONDON BRADFORD CARDIFF 
OF COURSE MANY OF THOSE CHILDREN HAD NEVER BEEN OUTSIDE WOLVERHAMPTON 
IF YOU MOVE A CHILD OF FOURTEEN OUT OF TOWN MOVE HER ONE HUNDRED MILES AWAY SHE IS COMPLETELY ISOLATED 
COMPLETELY COMPLETELY IN THE CONTROL AND IN THE HANDS OF RUTHLESS INDIVIDUALS 
THAT ARE PORTRAYING THEMSELVES TO BE CARING BOYFRIENDS 
ONCE A GIRL IS ALIENATED FROM ALL HER FAMILIAR SUPPORTS THE CONSEQUENCES CAN BE GRAVE 
WHAT WE SEE IS THAT MANY WOMEN WHO WORK AS PROSTITUTES IN ADULTHOOD WERE SEXUALLY EXPLOITED AS CHILDREN 
WOMEN IN PROSTITUTION DIDN'T WAKE UP ONE MORNING AND THINK I WILL BE A PROSTITUTE 
THERE WAS A PROCESS BY WHICH THEY GOT THERE 
THE EVIDENCE WE SEE AND THE INFORMATION WE RECEIVE 
SUGGESTS THAT MANY IF NOT MOST WERE EXPLOITED AS CHILDREN 
IN BLACKBURN POLICE BECOME CONCERNED ABOUT TWO TEENAGE GIRLS OUT AT NIGHT TEN MILES FROM HOME 
AND SEEMINGLY UNAWARE OF THE RISK THEY'RE RUNNING 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER HERE 
THEY HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY TO A DARK BACK STREET WHERE THERE ARE FOUR CARS OF MEN MYSTERIOUSLY WAITING 
I NEED TO CHECK YOUR NAMES AND YOUR DATE OF BIRTH 
WHY I WORK ON SOMETHING CALLED THE ENGAGE TEAM 
WE WORK WITH YOUNG GIRLS WHO ARE BEING SEXUALLY EXPLOITED BY OLDER MALES 
YOU'RE FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE SAFE AND YOU'RE NOT MISSING 
WITH NOTHING OBVIOUSLY CRIMINAL THE POLICE CANNOT COMPEL THE GIRLS TO CO OPERATE 
BUT THEY ARE EAGER TO TALK TO THE MEN 
THE DIFFICULTY WE'VE GOT IS THAT 
IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT SOME FORM OF INTELLIGENCE OR INFORMATION 
TO BACK UP WHAT YOU CAN SEE GOING ON IN FRONT OF YOU 
IT MAY WELL BE JUST INNOCENT BEHAVIOUR JUST KIDS BEING KIDS 
IF WE HAD SOME INFORMATION ON WHO THOSE GIRLS WERE 
AND THAT THEY ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF SOME SEXUAL EXPLOITATION THEN WE CAN TAKE MORE POSITIVE ACTION WITH THEM 
IN THIS SHADOWY WORLD IT'S HARD TO ESTABLISH THE FACTS ABOUT PATTERNS OF ABUSE 
CHILD PROSTITUTES MAY NOT BE VISIBLE STANDING ON STREET CORNERS 
THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE HIDDEN AWAY IN SOME FLAT ABOVE A TAXI FIRM 
BUT AROUND THE COUNTRY IT IS CLEAR THAT GANGS OF DIFFERENT RACIAL ORIGINS ARE PRINCIPALLY INVOLVED 
WE UNCOVERED EVIDENCE AGAINST PEOPLE FROM ASIAN BACKGROUNDS WHITE BACKGROUNDS AND BLACK BACKGROUNDS 
PREDOMINANTLY IN WOLVERHAMPTON THE PIMPS THAT WE CHARGED 
WITH OFFENCES WERE PREDOMINANTLY BLACK AFRO CARIBBEAN 
BUT I HAVE ALSO TRAVELLED DURING THE COURSE OF MY INVESTIGATIONS AND I HAVE PRESENTED SEMINARS IN YORKSHIRE 
WHERE I KNOW THAT IS NOT THE CASE WHERE I KNOW THAT ASIANS ARE THE MAIN CULPRITS 
THE POLICE ARE OVERCAUTIOUS IN DEALING WITH THIS OPENLY 
BECAUSE THEY FEAR BEING BRANDED RACIST I THINK THAT IS WRONG 
BUT THERE COULD BE A PROBLEM FOR POLICE IF THEY WERE TO SAY 
IT IS PRINCIPALLY DONE BY ASIAN GANGS THIS COULD STIR UP RACIAL TENSIONS 
THESE ARE CRIMINALS THEY SHOULD BE TREATED AS CRIMINALS 
THEY'RE NOT ASIAN CRIMINALS OR WHITE CRIMINALS THEY ARE CRIMINALS AND THEY SHOULD BE TREATED AS CRIMINALS 
IF OFFENCES ARE DISCLOSED THEY HAVE TO BE INVESTIGATED 
THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN IGNORE THEM BECAUSE OF A CERTAIN SENSITIVITY 
THEY HAVE TO BE INVESTIGATED 
YOU DON'T THINK THE POLICE ARE TOO CAUTIOUS BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF STIRRING UP RACIAL TENSION 
NOT WITHIN MY EXPERIENCE THE EXPERIENCE THAT I HAVE IS TO THE CONTRARY 
WHERE EVIDENCE HAS BEEN DISPLAYED IT HAS BEEN FOLLOWED THROUGH 
BUT I CANNOT SAY THAT IS THE CERTAINTY IN ALL CASES BECAUSE I HAVE TO TALK WITHIN MY EXPERIENCE 
AFTER ITS PILOT PROJECTS THE GOVERNMENT CHANGED THE LAW AND ISSUED GUIDANCE TO POLICE FORCES 
GROOMING IS NOW A SPECIFIC OFFENCE AND CHILDREN ARE NOW SEEN AS VICTIMS 
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN ONLY A DOZEN CONVICTIONS FOR PIMPING THEM 
A DECADE AGO IN WOLVERHAMPTON POLICE LEARNED HOW TO PROTECT VICTIMS AND GAIN CONVICTIONS 
LESSONS THEY FEAR HAVE BEEN LOST PIMPS BOAST THEY CAN DO AS THEY LIKE AND OFTEN THEY ARE RIGHT 
THERE ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE IN OUR PRISONS WITH CONVICTIONS FOR THESE SORTS OF OFFENCES 
DOES THAT MEAN THAT IF A GANG DECIDES IT WANTS TO PIMP YOUNG GIRLS 
THEY ARE LIKELY TO GET AWAY WITH IT 
THAT IS A BOLD ASSERTION 
BUT THE EVIDENCE WOULD SUPPORT THAT ASSERTION 
SO THE ANSWER IS YES ABSOLUTELY 
THE GOVERNMENT POINTS TO A RISING ANNUAL NUMBER 
OF SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTIONS FOR CHILD GROOMING AND PROSTITUTION OFFENCES 
IT'S FORTY FOUR PEOPLE CONVICTED UNDER THE TWO THOUSAND THREE ACT 
IF WE LOOK BACK TO THE OLD ACT TO THE DECADE BEFORE TWO THOUSAND THREE 
THERE ARE JUST SIX CONVICTIONS FOR THESE SORTS OF INCIDENTS 
ISN'T PROFESSOR BARRETT RIGHT IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO PIMP CHILDREN THEY'RE LIKELY TO GET AWAY WITH IT 
NO HE'S NOT WHERE ARE THE CONVICTIONS 
WE HAVE FORTY FOUR OUT OF A HUGE NUMBER LIKE FIVE THOUSAND CHILDREN 
IT'S FORTY FOUR WHICH IS AN INCREASE 
BUT IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH NO WE WANT TO DO MORE 
MANY CASES DON'T MAKE IT TO COURT BECAUSE THE CHILDREN INVOLVED ARE TOO SCARED TO TALK 
ONE OFFICER SAID THEY ARE MORE FRIGHTENED OF THEIR PIMPS THAN THEY ARE OF THE LAW 
SOME OF THEM ARE TERRIFIED AND WITH RIGHT REASONS 
WE HAD A CASE IN THE WEST MIDLANDS WHERE 
THE GIRL HAD HER TONGUE NAILED TO THE TABLE WHEN SHE THREATENED TO TELL 
I WORKED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD HER HAIR YANKED BACK MOUTH OPEN 
WITH A KETTLE OF BOILING WATER HELD ABOVE HER THROAT 
YOU DON'T TELL OR RUN AWAY IF YOU'VE GOT A KETTLE OF BOILING WATER HELD ABOVE YOUR THROAT 
THERE ARE NETWORKS OF THESE BOYFRIENDS SO THAT EVEN WHERE MEN HAVE BEEN REMANDED INTO CUSTODY 
GIRLS HAVE BEEN THREATENED OVER THE PHONE 
ONE DAY I WAS PICKED UP BY AN OLDER MAN HE WAS A LOT OLDER THAN ME 
AND TOOK ME TO A PARK I DIDN'T KNOW THIS MAN AND THEN I WAS TOLD 
HE PULLED A GUN OUT AND PUT IT TO MY HEAD AND TOLD ME I WERE GOING TO DIE IN THREE SECONDS 
HE COUNTED DOWN FROM THREE TO ONE AND PULLED THE TRIGGER 
BUT IT WASN'T LOADED AND THAT WAS HE FOUND THAT AMUSING 
THE FAMILY REPORTED JANE'S CASE TO THE POLICE 
BUT SHE WITHDREW HER ALLEGATIONS SHE SAYS BECAUSE POLICE OFFICERS COULDN'T GUARANTEE HER SAFETY 
THE FORCE CONCERNED SAY THEY INVESTIGATED THE CASE BUT COULD NOT FIND ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PROSECUTE 
JANE IS NOW CONSIDERING AN ACTION CLAIMING POLICE NEGLIGENCE 
EXPERTS HAVE TOLD US THAT THEY ARE REMINDED OF THE POSITION WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TWENTY YEARS AGO 
EVERYTHING HANGS ON THE KEY WITNESS AND SHE WON'T TALK BECAUSE SHE IS PETRIFIED OR SHE BLAMES HERSELF 
THERE'S A NEW APPROACH TO FAMILY VIOLENCE NOW 
ABUSED PARTNERS GET PROTECTION AND THE SUPPORT THEY NEED 
BUT THAT IS OFTEN MISSING FOR EXPLOITED CHILDREN 
IT'S AS IF WE STILL EXPECT THEM TO SIMPLY LEAVE THEIR PIMPS 
IN THE PAST WE USED TO SAY THAT WITH DOMESTIC ABUSE WHY DOES SHE STAY WITH HIM 
IT'S UNDERSTANDING THE EMOTIONAL TRAUMAS THESE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE GONE THROUGH 
WE KNOW ON AVERAGE IT CAN TAKE SEVEN YEARS FOR AN ADULT WOMAN TO LEAVE A VIOLENT PARTNER 
WE ARE TALKING HERE ABOUT CHILDREN WHO HAVEN'T GOT THAT UNDERSTANDING OR MATURITY 
THE OFFICER WHO RAN WOLVERHAMPTON'S SUCCESSFUL OPERATION A DECADE AGO 
ARGUES THAT POLICE NEED COMMITTED TEAMS TO ACHIEVE SIMILAR RESULTS 
MY VIEW IS THAT THE ONLY WAY IT WILL BE UNCOVERED AND THE ONLY WAY TO STOP 
WHAT IS A REALLY SERIOUS CRIME IS TO HAVE DEDICATED UNITS 
AS WE DO NOW WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
WHICH HISTORICALLY IS A SUBJECT THAT WAS NEVER RECOGNISED 
HAVE DEDICATED UNITS TO DEAL WITH IT WITH CHILD PROSTITUTION 
YES BECAUSE MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT IT IS OCCURRING IN ALL MAJOR CITIES ACROSS THE U. K. 
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND ONLY TWO POLICE FORCES WHICH HAVE DEDICATED UNITS WORKING WITH OTHER AGENCIES 
IN BLACKBURN THE NEW POLICE UNIT FIGHTING CHILD PROSTITUTION 
WORKS WITH SOCIAL SERVICES EDUCATION AND HEALTH TEAMS 
BUT DOES IT HAVE ENOUGH OFFICERS FOR THE TASK IT FACES 
I SUPPOSE PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE THERE ARE NEVER ENOUGH POLICE OFFICERS OR SOCIAL WORKERS 
THERE'S YOU FULL TIME AND ONE PART TIME COLLEAGUE FROM THE POLICE 
YES A PART TIME SERGEANT DOES THAT SEEM TO BE ENOUGH TO YOU 
NO WHEN WE DO HAVE A COMPLEX CASE THAT COMES IN 
IT'S MANY MANY HOURS OF INVESTIGATION 
DOESN'T IT REPRESENT A SHOCKING FAILURE BY THE GOVERNMENT 
THAT A DECADE AFTER THE PILOT PROJECTS THE HOME OFFICE SET UP SHOWED 
THIS WAS AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM AND THAT IT COULD BE TACKLED 
YOU ARE STILL SAYING TO ME WE SHOULD BE DOING BETTER 
NO I'M SAYING WE HAVE IN MANY RESPECTS DONE BETTER 
PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF THE SUPPORT THAT WE HAVE GIVEN TO VICTIMS 
IF WE TALK TO THE POLICE AND THE PROSECUTORS 
WE KNOW IT'S A DIFFICULT AREA TO PROSECUTE 
PART OF THE PROBLEM IS HOW WE GIVE THE CONFIDENCE TO THE VICTIMS IN ORDER TO GIVE EVIDENCE 
THEY FOUND THIS IN WOLVERHAMPTON AND NOTTINGHAM A DECADE AGO THEY FOUND OUT HOW TO DO IT 
YOU HAVE NOT MADE POLICE FORCES UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY DO IT 
WE'VE ISSUED THE GUIDANCE TO POLICE FORCES GUIDANCE 
WE'VE ISSUED GUIDANCE AND THE GUIDANCE WILL BE UPDATED 
THE POLICE ARE LOOKING AT HOW THEY ENSURE THAT THAT IS ENFORCED 
AND ALONGSIDE THAT EACH POLICE FORCE HAS CHILD ABUSE INVESTIGATION UNITS OPERATING AND FUNCTIONING 
THE NEXT DAY THE HOME OFFICE E. MAILED PANORAMA TO CONFIRM 
THAT PIMPING CHILDREN WILL BE COVERED IN NEW POLICE TARGETS 
AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID IT WILL PRODUCE A WARNING VIDEO FOR USE IN ALL SCHOOLS 
MEANWHILE ONE OF THE OLDEST CRIMES IN HISTORY CONTINUES 
TO THREATEN BRITISH CHILDREN AT THE THRESHOLD OF ADULT LIFE 
I WAS JUST AN INNOCENT LITTLE GIRL WHO WENT FROM PLAYING WITH HER DOLLS 
TO BEING THIS ADULT WHO WAS HAVING SEX WITH LOADS OF DIFFERENT MEN 
ON MONDAY SIX WEEKS AFTER POLICE SEARCH TEAMS STARTED DIGGING 
BENEATH A CHILDREN'S HOME ON JERSEY OUR CAMERAS GO INSIDE TO THE HEART OF THE INVESTIGATION 
THAT'S JERSEY ISLAND OF SECRETS BACK IN OUR USUAL SLOT ON MONDAY AT EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY 
ADAM WHO YOU DON'T KNOW HIS LAST NAME HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN GOING OUT WITH HIM THREE WEEKS 
NO WE'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE YOU UNLESS WE THINK YOU ARE SAFE
