THE RANGE'S SLOPES DIVE DOWN TO ROCKY COASTS 
SANDIER BEACHES ARE FURTHER NORTH

HUH THERE'S SAND IN THERE WELL THERE'S SAND ON THE GROUND 
IN A HOT CLIMATE YOU CAN HAVE MANY OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES 
WHEN IT GETS REALLY HOT THE ONLY WAY TO COOL DOWN IS TO TAKE A SWIM 
ON AN ISLAND THERE'S A LOT OF FISHING

THE LAST OF THE DRY WEATHER IS IN MAY 
PEOPLE STILL PICNIC BETWEEN SHOWERS MAKE THE MOST OF IT 
THE RAIN IS ON ITS WAY 
WHEN THE RAINY SEASON GETS UNDER WAY IT'LL LAST FROM JUNE TO NOVEMBER 
DOMINICA IS LIKE EVERYWHERE IN THE CARIBBEAN DURING THIS SEASON 
THE RAIN GUSHES DOWN IN A TROPICAL STORM TWENTY C. M. CAN FALL IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
DOMINICANS GET EVEN MORE RAINFALL THAN OTHER ISLANDS NEARBY 
DOMINICA IS IN THE PATH OF THE NORTH EAST TRADE WINDS 
THEY BLOW ACROSS THE ATLANTIC TO THE CARIBBEAN 
THE TRADE WINDS COME IN FROM THE SEA 
THEY BLOW MASSES OF MOIST AIR UP OVER DOMINICA'S MOUNTAINOUS SLOPES 
CLOUDS OF MIST GATHER AND AS THEY COOL THEY RELEASE RAIN 
SOMETIMES ISLANDS CAN BE HIT BY 
HURRICANES 
THEY'RE VIOLENT STORMS THAT APPEAR IN THE RAINY SEASON 
DOMINICA IS IN THE HURRICANE PATH 
DURING THE RAINY SEASON THEY MAY HIT DESTROYING PROPERTY AND HOMES 
SOMETIMES LIVES MAY EVEN BE LOST 
TO HELP YOU REMEMBER WHEN HURRICANES HAPPEN HERE'S A POEM 
THE EAST COAST FACING THE ATLANTIC IS ESPECIALLY AT RISK 
VILLAGES LIKE RIVIERE CYRIQUE HIGH IN THE MOUNTAINS MUST BE PREPARED 
ERNIE'S DOING JUST THAT IN HER HOUSE 
HURRICANE BE PREPARED MAKE A FAMILY PLAN 
HOUSES LIKE ERNIE'S FRAGILE AND MADE OF WOOD ARE MOST AT RISK 
SO WHEN THERE'S A WARNING STRONGER HOUSES ARE CONVERTED INTO SHELTERS 
IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WE WERE ASKED IF OUR HOUSE COULD BE A HURRICANE SHELTER 
IT'S MADE FROM CONCRETE BLOCKS WHICH MEANS IT'S STRONG AND SECURE 
EVEN SO WE HAVE TO SECURE THE WINDOWS AND DOORS 
WHEN THERE'S A HURRICANE ALERT 
WE USE GALVANISED METAL AND WOOD TO SECURE THE WINDOWS AND THE DOORS 
DOMINICANS OFTEN RECALL WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN A HURRICANE STRIKES 
LET'S HEAR ERNIE'S ACCOUNT 
IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE HURRICANE MARLENE HIT DOMINICA 
I WAS SITTING IN THE KITCHEN 
THE RAIN WAS LIKE SOMEONE DRUMMING ON THE ROOF 
MOMMY WHAT'S THAT IT SOUNDS AS IF A HURRICANE IS COMING I'LL GO LOOK 
WE HEARD THE WIND HOWLING AND SCREAMING 
WE SAW TREES BENDING AND BREAKING LOSING THEIR BATTLE WITH THE WIND 
THE SKY WAS DARK EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T NIGHT 
MOMMY TURNED ON THE RADIO AND WE HEARD A HURRICANE WARNING 
A HURRICANE IS APPROACHING MAKE YOUR WAY TO YOUR LOCAL SHELTER 
STAY CALM TAKE BLANKETS FOOD DRINKS AND GAMES TO PLAY 
ERNIE WE HAVE TO RUN TO THE SHELTER 
MOMMY SHOUTED AT ME TO GRAB SOME FOOD WE ALL RAN TO THE SHELTER 
LUCKILY THE SHELTER ISN'T FAR FROM OUR HOUSE 
IT'S ALSO MY GRANDPARENTS' HOUSE 
WE STAYED HERE FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS 
THREE OF MY FRIENDS WERE HERE AND WE PLAYED GAMES FOR THREE DAYS 
BUT WE ALL FELT SCARED AT TIMES WE THOUGHT THE ROOF WOULD BLOW OFF 
THERE WERE TWENTY PEOPLE 
I FELT EMBARRASSED BECAUSE THERE WAS NOWHERE TO GO TO BE ALONE 
AFTER THREE DAYS THE WIND HAD CALMED DOWN 
THE RAIN WASN'T AS HEAVY AND WE COULD GO HOME 
IT HAD FLOODED THE FURNITURE WAS DAMAGED THE CROPS WERE DESTROYED 
THIS WHOLE AREA WAS BARE 
HURRICANES HIT THE CARIBBEAN BETWEEN JUNE AND NOVEMBER 
WE NEVER KNOW WHAT DAMAGE THEY'LL DO 
WE CAN ONLY STRENGTHEN OUR HOMES AND BE PREPARED 
MY FRIENDS WANT TO SEE ANOTHER I CAN LIVE WITHOUT THAT 
JUST TIME TO REMIND ERNIE THAT AFTER BAD WEATHER THERE'S GOOD 
THE LAND WILL RECOVER AND VEGETATION RETURN 
IT'S CALLED THE CYCLE OF THE SEASONS THE SUN WILL SHINE AGAIN
