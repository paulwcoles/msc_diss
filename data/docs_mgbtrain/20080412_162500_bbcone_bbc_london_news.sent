FINED IF THEY'RE CAUGHT THROWING 
RUBBISH FROM THEIR VEHICLES THEY 
WILL ALSO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
LITTERING BY ANY OF THEIR 
PASSENGERS COUNCIL BYLAWS WILL BE 
CHANGED TO ENABLE PENALTIES TO BE 
HANDED OUT 
LITTER IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN THE 
CAPITAL WITH ALMOST TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND TONNES 
OF IT DROPPED EACH YEAR SO A PILOT 
SCHEME WILL BEGIN THIS SUMMER WHERE 
IN THE SAME WAY THAT POLICE ENFORCE 
SPEEDING FINES LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
CAN TRACK DOWN DRIVERS OR THEIR 
PASSENGERS FOR LITTERING AT THE 
MOMENT OFFICIALS CAN ONLY TAKE 
ACTION IF THEY CAN PROVE THE 
IDENTIFY OF THE INDIVIDUAL THROWING 
RUBBISH OUT OF A CAR EVEN IF THEY 
KNOW THE NUMBER PLATE BUT THAT'S 
SOON SET TO CHANGE 
ONCE REGISTERED KEEPER HAD RECEIVED 
THIS NOTICE LIKE A FIXED PENALTY 
FINE THEY WOULD EITHER ACCEPT THAT 
THEY WERE THE DRIVER AND PAY THE 
FINE OR THEY WOULD HAVE TO GIVE 
THE NAME OF THE DRIVER OR THE 
OFFENDER IN ORDER NOT TO HAVE TO 
PAY THE FINE THEMSELVES EVIDENCE EVIDENCE COLLECTED FROM C. C. T. V. TRAFFIC 
WARDENS AND EVEN MEMBERS OF THE 
PUBLIC USING THEIR MOBILE PHONES 
COULD BE USED TO ISSUE FINES OF UP 
TO EIGHTY 
LIRTING IS BAD REALLY WE SHOULDN'T 
BE ALLOWED TO LITTER WHY IS IT 
EIGHTY WHY CAN'T IT BE LIKE A TEN IF IF YOU HAVE RUBBISH KEEP IT ON YOU 
UNTIL YOU FIND A BIN DON'T DUMP IT 
ON THE STREET 
SO FROM JUNE THE 
LAWS WILL BE CHANGED IF SUCCESSFUL 
OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WILL 
FOLLOW SUIT

POLITICALLY CORRECT MAYORAL 
ADVISORS AND SCRAPPING THE 
CONGESTION CHARGE THE B. N. P.'S

THE POINT IS THAT THE LAST 
RECOGNITION BOTH BORIS JOHNSON AND 
KEN LIVINGSTONE AND EVEN MR.

PROTEST AGAINST THE COMMENTS
