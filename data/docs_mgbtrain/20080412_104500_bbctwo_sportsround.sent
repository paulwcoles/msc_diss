THIS IS SUPERKIDS L. LOVE IT DID 
YOU SEE LIZZIE'S FACE WHEN THE 
INSTRUCTOR SAID HE THOUGHT THE BOYS 
WOULD WIN SEE WHAT HAPPENS LATER 
NOW IT'S TIME FOR A RACKET SPORT 
THAT IS FOUR SPORTS ROLLED INTO ONE 
CONFUSED DON'T WORRY IT'S SIMPLE 
COULD THIS BE THE ULTIMATE RACKET 
SPORT FIRST YOU PLAY A BIT OF 
TABLE TENNIS 
A BIT OF BADMINTON AND THEN MY 
FAVOURITE RACKET SPORT SQUASH AND 
THEN TENNIS NOW THEN RHODRI AND 
ALEX U. LIKE THE MURRAY BROTHERS 
HOW DOES IT WORK 
YOU PROGRESS FROM 
THE SMALLER SPORT TABLE TENNIS TO 
THE LARGER SPORT WHICH IS TENNIS 
WHAT ABOUT THE SCORING EACH OF 
THOSE HAVE THEIR OWN SCORING SETS 
HOW DO YOU WORK OUT WHICH HAS WON 
EACH SET HAS TWENTY ONE POINTS TO 
UNDERSTAND RACK WILL HE TON IS TO 
PLAY IT 
FIRST UP IS TABLE NEN N. I. S. I AM 
GOING TO GET THRASHED SET POINT TO HIM TOO EASY 
I AM ELEVEN N. T. S. DOWN FROM THE TABLE 
NEN TIS I AM DETERMINED TO DO 
BETTER AT BADMINTON ARE YOU READY HE JUST MISSED 
TIME FOR SQUASH THIS IS MY 
FAVOURITE BIT 
SIXTEEN TO EIGHT I AM DOING BETTER BUT I AM 
FRUSTRATED BECAUSE SQUASH USED TO 
BE MY GAME IT'S MATCHPOINT I AM SO 
FRUSTRATED 
ANOTHER ONE DOWN IT'S TIME FOR 
TENNIS 
I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS I KNOW I 
HAVE TOTALLY LOST NOW 
MAYBE IF I HAD CHOSEN TENNIS OVER 
ATHLETICS AT SCHOOL I WOULD BE 
BETTER 
THAT WAS ACTUALLY A REASONABLY GOOD 
SHOT 
I DON'T THINK THAT YOU TWO WERE 
TRYING A HARD AS YOU WOULD HAVE 
DONE BUT THANK YOU AND THANK YOU 
TO RACKETLON L. THOUGHT IT WAS 
COMPLICATED I WAS WORRIED ABOUT 
NOT UNDERSTANDING IT ABOUT GETTING 
THE HAND OF DIFFERENT SPORTS BUT 
RACKETLON IS SIMPLE IT'S ALL 
ABOUT THE POINTS WHICH I DIDN'T 
HAVE ENOUGH OF IT WAS A STRANGE 
SCORE IN THE END KWHRIZ DOESN'T 
LIKE LOSING NOW THEN THERE IS ONE 
MEMBER OF THE SPORTSROUND TEAM WE 
HAVE YET TO SEE ANY GUESSS GO
