SO HOW'S THE PREGNANCY GOING 
TERRIFYING I'M JUST NOT CONNECTING WITH THE KID 
I'M A RUBBISH DAD AND JANET'S GONE COMPLETELY STUPID 
THE KERRY AND BRIAN OF RUNCORN 
IT'S NORMAL FOR WOMEN TO GET A BIT DIZZY WHEN THEY'RE HAVING A BABY ESPECIALLY BLONDE ONES 
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT 
I READ IT IN A PREGNANCY BOOK 
WHAT LABOUR BABES 
OR HAPPY NAPPY SLAPPERS' BAPS

I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU NEED TO READ BOOKS I MEAN THE ANTENATAL CLASSES WILL FILL YOU IN I'VE NOT BEEN 
YOU HAVE TO YOU'LL BE USELESS ALL THE OTHER DADS WILL BE MILES BETTER THAN ME 
THEY'LL BE DEAD PALLY AND BEZZIE MATES WITH THEIR WIVES' UTERUSES 
JANET'S GOING IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT YEAH A COUPLE OF TIMES A WEEK THE NEIGHBOUR GIVES HER A LIFT 
ON HIS MOPED SHE CAN'T BE GOING ON A MOPED DON'T YOU KNOW ANYTHING

OH MY GOD GAZ LOOKS AMAZING 
HOW DARE HE 
FIRST QUESTION LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHICH BOOK IT EXECUTIVE 
WANTS A TASTY PORTION OF RAW COCK FROM HER EX BOYFRIEND 
WHAT WAS I REACHING FOR 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TRYING TO DO A SIT UP 
CRISIS I NEED TO MAKE AN EFFORT I CAN'T HAVE GAZ LOOKING LIKE HE'S JUST STEPPED OUT OF A SALON 
WHEN I LOOK LIKE I'VE JUST STEPPED OUT OF A HEDGE HALLELUJAH SHE'S LOOKED IN THE MIRROR 
MY TITS I'LL GET MY TITS DONE I'VE GOT THE CASH YEAH WE COULD MATCH 
NO I DON'T THINK I'D KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH BIG BOOBS I'D BE LIKE A KID AT CHRISTMAS WITH A NEW TOY 
JUST LIKE CHRISTMAS I'D ONLY END UP PLAYING WITH THE BOX 
WHAT DO YOU THINK JANET 
WELL I THINK 
NO IT'S GONE 
MY MIND IS A BLANK WHAT AM I GOING TO DO HOW CAN I BRING UP A KID WHEN I CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING 
I NEVER USED TO BE LIKE THIS I USED TO READ DELIA JAMIE ALL THE CLASSICS I COULD HELP YOU 
WHAT COULD YOU DO I COULD TRAIN YOUR BRAIN 
I DO HAVE A DEGREE YOU KNOW I COULD TEACH YOU TO HOLD ON TO INFORMATION 
OR HOW TO PAY GRADUATES TO SIT EXAMS FOR YOU THANK YOU 
MY LIPS I'LL GET MY LIPS DONE 
IS IT DAVE 
IT REALLY SHOULD BE YOU TAKING JANET TO THESE ANTENATAL CLASSES JONNY 
I'M NOT THE DAD THAT'S THE THING I DON'T FEEL LIKE THE DAD 
I DON'T FEEL LIKE THERE'LL BE A BABY HERE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS 
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF JANET JUST DEFLATED AFTER ALL OF THIS I DON'T KNOW IT MIGHT BE A BIT WEIRD 
I GOT TO LISTEN TO ITS HEART ON THAT LITTLE LECCIE STETHOSCOPE THEY'VE GOT WHY DIDN'T THAT MAKE IT REAL 
WHAT DID IT SOUND LIKE IT SOUNDED LIKE A LITTLE DRUM AND A BIG DRUM 
IT CAN PLAY THE DRUMS 
AND I GOT TO SEE IT TOO 
SEE IF YOU SQUINT YOUR EYES AND YOU LOOK CLOSELY YOU CAN SEE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE AN ARSE 
THAT'S ITS FACE 
OH GOD JONNY I'LL TAKE JANET TO ANTENATAL OF COURSE I WILL 
HE'S GORGEOUS LIKE HIS DAD 
TA VERY MUCH 
AND HOW CAN WE HELP YOU DONNA I WANT MY LIPS DOING 
I WANT TO LOOK DIFFERENT BUT NOT TOO DIFFERENT SO IT'S NOT SO PEOPLE NOTICE 
PEOPLE JUST SAY MY DONNA'S LOOKING WELL ISN'T SHE 
WITHOUT SOMEBODY ELSE SAYING OH I THINK SHE'S HAD HER LIPS DONE 
AND THEN THE OTHER PERSON SAYS OH YEAH I WOULDN'T HAVE NOTICED UNLESS YOU'D POINTED IT OUT 
THEN THE OTHER PERSON SAYS I THINK IT LOOKS STUPID AND THEN THE OTHER SAYS WE SHOULD AVOID HER TYPE 
THEN THE OTHER PERSON SAYS SHALL WE MOVE AND THE OTHER PERSON SAYS YEAH WHAT ABOUT THE BARLEY MOW 
THEN THE OTHER PERSON SAYS SHALL WE TRY THE NEW WETHERSPOONS 
AND THEN THE OTHER PERSON SAYS NO YOU CAN'T SMOKE AT THE BAR 
THEN THE OTHER PERSON SAYS O. K. BARLEY MOW IT IS BUT I DON'T WANT TO BUMP INTO MY EX HUSBAND 
THEN THE OTHER PERSON SAYS AYE YOU'RE NOT WRONG THERE BEST GO HOME AND SMACK US KIDS ABOUT 
AT A BASIC LEVEL I DON'T WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO SUFFER O. K. THAT'S FINE 
FIRST OFF WE NEED TO TALK THROUGH YOUR REASONS WHY YOU WANT THIS DONE AND THEN I'LL DISCUSS THE RISKS 
THE RISKS 
NOBODY TOLD ME ABOUT THE RISKS 
WHAT COULD HAPPEN I DON'T WANT TO BE SCARRED 
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK I'VE DONE THIS OUT OF VANITY BECAUSE I'M NOT A VAIN PERSON I'M NOT 
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE SAYING IN THE PUB HEY HAVE YOU SEEN DONNA RECENTLY 
SHE'S RIGHT VAIN HAD HER LIPS DONE AND THE OTHER SAYS WE SHOULD AVOID HER TYPE AND THEN 
WHY DO YOU WANT THIS DONE DONNA 
BECAUSE GAZ IS PRETTIER THAN ME 
I JUST THINK BIGGER LIPS WOULD HELP WITH THAT 
ARE YOU SURE SURGERY IS THE ANSWER 
WELL IS PROZAC THE ANSWER 
TO BE HONEST YES USUALLY 
BECAUSE AFTER MY MUM DIED OUR G. P. WAS REALLY KEEN FOR US TO GO ON THAT 
WHEN I WOULDN'T HAVE PROZAC HE OFFERED DIAZEPAM 
WHEN I WOULDN'T HAVE DIAZEPAM HE OFFERED LITHIUM AND WHEN I WOULDN'T HE OFFERED A NEW PUPPY 
I JUST THINK HE RAN OUT OF IDEAS 
YOU NEED TO WORK THROUGH THIS BEFORE YOU EVEN CONSIDER ALTERING YOUR FACE 
HAVE YOU TRIED EXERCISING AND LOOKING AT YOUR DIET MY DIET 
I'M THE SAME WEIGHT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN 
I CAN EAT WHAT I WANT AND DRINK WHAT I WANT I AM ONE OF THOSE HATEFUL BITCHES APPARENTLY 
THAT WAS WHAT DEAR OLD MUM USED TO SAY YOU COULD BE DEPRESSED 
I'D ADVISE YOU TO LOOK AFTER YOUR BODY AND YOU'LL BENEFIT FROM IT EMOTIONALLY THAT'S ALL 
LOOK AFTER MYSELF YES 
THAT'S YOUR ADVICE YEAH 
AND I PAID TWO HUNDRED QUID FOR THIS CONSULTATION 
YES LOOKING AT IT IT'S NOT VERY GOOD IS IT 
WHEN ALARMED THE SPRINGBOK WILL STOT OR PRONK 
THAT IS JUMP STIFF LEGGED INTO THE AIR 
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS HOW HIGH JANET HOW HIGH 
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT 
COME ON I'VE THROWN YOU IN AT THE DEEP END 
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO RETAIN FACTS IF YOUR MEMORY IS TO IMPROVE 
I'LL GIVE YOU A MARGIN OF THREE FEET 
O. K. SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT N. O. NINE FOOT 
YOU THINK A SPRINGBOK CAN JUMP SEVEN HUNDRED F. T. IN THE AIR 
AH AH SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY NINE 
IT'S TWELVE FEET 
POOR JANET 
POOR ENORMOUS JANET 
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO 
THIS KID NEEDS ALL THE HELP IT CAN GET JONNY CAN'T HELP 
HE THINKS CASABLANCA WAS A REAL PLACE

AND YOU'RE SCARED OF RESPONSIBILITY HOW'S IT GOING TO BE WHEN HE GETS ON HIS FIRST TRAMPOLINE TRAMPOLINE 
YES HE'LL WANT SOMEONE THERE WE ALL DO 
I SUPPOSE AND WHEN HE GETS IN HIS FIRST FIGHT 
SOMEONE NEEDS TO SQUARE UP TO THE OTHER ONE'S DAD AND TO BE HONEST I'M A DAMN SIGHT SQUARER 
JUST BECAUSE I'M SCARED DOESN'T MEAN HE NEEDS SOMEONE TO COMFORT HIM WHEN HE HAS HIS SCARY FIRST WANK 
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE BROKEN IT 
WELL ME DAD WAS THE LAST THING I WAS THINKING OF 
NOW MY SISTER THAT WAS A DIFFERENT MATTER 
YOU DON'T HAVE A SISTER I KNOW I MADE HER UP SHE WAS FIT 
AND FRENCH AS I RECALL
