BAGS OF BELONGSING FROM SHANNON'S 
HOME WERE TAKEN AWAY HER STEP 
FATHER WAS ARRESTED AFTER A 
COMPUTER SEIZED AT AN EARLIER DATE 
WAS APPARENTLY FOUND TO HOLD 
INDECENT IMAGES OF CHILDREN 
NEIGHBOURS IN DEWSBURY HAVE BEEN 
LEFT SHOCKED BY TODAY'S DEVELOPMENT 
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WERE CRAIG OR NOT 
I HOPED IT WASN'T I COME OUTSIDE 
AND SEE YOU LOT HANGING AROUND AND 
I THOUGHT IT MUST BE I'M GOING 
THE REPORTS TOLD ME HE HAD BEEN 
ARRESTED EARLIER THIS MORNING 
SHANNON IS STILL BEING LOOKED AFTER 
BY POLICE AND SOCIAL SERVICES 
DESPITE IT BEING NEARLY THREE WEEKS 
SINCE SHE WAS FOUND HER MOTHER HAS 
STILL ONLY SEEN HER ONCE AND HAS 
NOT SPOKEN TO HER ONCE AGAIN 
POLICE ARE STANDING GUARD OUTSIDE 
THE MATTHEWS' HOME AS PART OF 
WIDER INQUIRY FOLLOWING THE 
DISAPPEARANCE OF SHANNON AS FOR 
CRAIG MEEHAN HE'S NOW BEING HELD 
BY DETECTIVES AND IS BEING 
QUESTIONED AT A POLICE STATION IN 
WEST YORKSHIRE OVER THE 
ALLEGATIONS THAT HE'S FACING HOW 
WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE MOOD THERE 
THEN 
WHAT WE ARE WE ARE NEARLY THEN THREE WEEKS SINCE SHANNON HAS BEEN 
FOUND AND EVERYONE WAS EXPECTING 
HER TO COME HOME FAIRLY SOON BUT 
THEY ARE SHOCKED AND SURPRISED BY 
THIS LATEST TURN IN THIS INQUIRY 
THERE ARE POSTERS UP IF YOU LOOK 
AROUND SAYING WELCOME HOME SHANNON 
BUT IT SEEMS THAT ANY PROSPECT OF 
THAT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY 
REMOTE REMOTE THE MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY IN 
ZIMBABWE THE MOVEMENT FOR 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE HAS CLAIMED 
VICTORY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION IN THE PAST FEW MINUTES 
THE PARTY HAS SAID IT'S LEADER 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI HAS WON ENOUGH OF 
THE VOTES TO BE DECLARED THE 
OUTRIGHT WINNER OFFICIAL RESULTS 
HAVE STILL NOT BEEN ANNOUNCED BUT A 
STATE RUN NEWSPAPER HAS REPORTED 
THAT NEITHER OF THE CANDIDATES HAS 
GAINED ENOUGH SUPPORT TO BE NAMED 
THE VICTOR THE B. B. C. IS ONE OF THE 
BROADCASTERS BANNED FROM ZIMBABWE 
OUR REPORTER IS IN NEIGHBOURING 
SOUTH AFRICA 
ZIMBABWE IS STILL IN SUSPENSE FOUR 
DAYS AFTER POLLING THERE IS 
GROWING EXPECTATION THAT A RUN OFF 
BETWEEN MUGABE AND THE OPPOSITION 
M. D. C. COULD BE ON THE CARDS EVEN THE 
STATE RUN NEWSPAPER 
THAT 
STATE RUN NEWSPAPER PREDICTS THAT NIERNING SIDE WILL WIN ROUT RIGHT 
NEITHER OUTRIGHT 
IF IT'S A 
TIE IT WILL BE A RERUN SO EVERYONE 
IS WAITING FOR A RERUN OF THE 
PRESIDENTIAL POST 
THE DELAY IN 
ANNOUNCING THE OFFICIAL RESULT IS 
MAKING PEOPLE NERVOUS HAUNTED BY 
THE MEMORIES OF PAST ELECTIONS THE 
STAKES ARE HIGHER THAN EVER BEFORE 
WE WANT THE CORRECT RESULT SO 
WHETHER THEY TAKE FOURTEEN DAYS TO COME 
OUT I'M SURE WE WILL GET THERE ON ON THE STREETS OF HARARE IT MAY LOOK 
LIKE BUSINESS AS USUAL BUT BEHIND 
THE SCENES ZIMBABWE'S FUTURE IS 
BEING SHAPED ANALYSTS BELIEVE 
THERE WERE SECOND ROUND BELIEVE A 
SECOND ROUND CONTEST IS RISKY AND 
IT COULD BE PART OF A PLAN TO EASE 
ROBERT MUGABE OUT 
TO AVOID 
HUMILIATION ROBERT MUGABE WILL 
ANNOUNCE HE WILL COMPETE AND THEN 
STEP DOWN THERE IS A THIRD 
SITUATION THAT HE WILL ACCEPT A 
RUN OFF TO BUY HIMSELF MORE TIME 
AND MAY EVEN WANT TO UNDERMINE THE 
PROCESS ENTIRELY 
FOR ORDINARY 
ZIMBABWEANS LIFE IN THIS ONCE RICH 
COUNTRY HAS BECOME MISERABLE 
SUPPORT HEADING AWAY FROM A 
PRESIDENT SEEN AS SOME AS A 
LIBERATOR AGAINST WHITE RULE THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS RUMOURED 
TO BE PRESSING ROBERT MUGABE TO 
STEP ASIDE NOTHING IS CERTAIN AND 
EVERYONE IS HOLDING THEIR BREATH 
IN THE PAST FEW MINUTES THE 
OPPOSITION M. D. C. PARTY HAS GIVEN A 
NEWS CONFERENCE IN WHICH THEY DID 
CLAIM VICTORY 
AN INDEPENDENT 
REPORT USING METHODS THAT HAVE BEEN 
TRIED AND TESTS ELSEWHERE CONFIRMS 
WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW AND WHAT WE 
ARE CONFIRMING NAMELY THAT MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI IS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF 
THE REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE AND IS SO 
WITHOUT A RUN OFF 
IN ONE MOMENT WE'LL SPEAK TO OUR 
REPORTER WHO IS ON THE BORDER BUT 
FIRST WE CAN SPEAK TO IAN WHO IS 
INSIDE ZIMBABWE IAN THAT NEWS 
JUST BEING ANNOUNCED BY THE M. D. C. 
THEY FEEL CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO CLAIM 
VICTORY IN THE PRESIDENT YL 
ELECTION WHAT REACTION THERE 
PRESIDENTIAL 
AT THE MOMENT PEOPLE PRESIDENTIAL ARE JUST IN THE SITUATION WHERE 
THEY ARE TRYING TO DIGEST THIS NEWS 
THE PRESS CONFERENCE IS STILL GOING 
ON NOT MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIRECT 
ACCESS TO SATELLITE TELEVISION OF 
COURSE STATE TELEVISION AND STATE 
CONTROLLED MEDIA NOT COVERING THIS 
PRESS CONFERENCE IT'S A SIGN OF 
THE FRUSTRATION THAT EXISTS IN THE 
COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE GOT TO THIS 
STAGE WHERE PEOPLE WILL ALSO FEEL 
SLIGHTLY NERVOUS NOW WAITING TO SEE 
WHAT THE RESPONSE WILL BE FROM THE 
RULING ZANU P. F. AND ROBERT MUGABE 
AS YOU SAY THERE IS SO MUCH 
SPECULATION AT THE MOMENT IT IS 
REALLY VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS NEXT 
IT IS BUT 
NEVERTHELESS I I THINK IT'S A VERY 
BOLD AND PROVOCATIVE MOVE AND MANY 
PEOPLE HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION 
THAT THERE ARE POSSIBLY TWO 
RESPONSES THAT EITHER THE M. D. C. THEN 
TAKE TO THE STREETS AND CELEBRATE 
THE VICTORY OR THAT THE AUTHORITIES 
RESPOND THEY HAVE WARNED IN THE 
PAST THAT ANY UNILATERAL 
DECLARATION WOULD BE SEEN AS AN 
ATTEMPTED COUP WE HAVE NOT HEARD 
FROM THE THE RULING PARTY AND DON'T 
KNOW THEIR RESPONSE BUT THEY HAD 
WARNED AGAINST THIS KIND OF 
DECLARATION WE ARE STILL IN VERY 
UNCHARTERED TERRITORY 
THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH ORLA IS ON THE ZIMBABWE 
AND SOUTH AFRICA BORDER AS WE HAVE 
BEEN HEARING UNCHARTERED TERRITORY 
WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT 
WELL T. IS 
VERY UNCHARTERED TERRITORY THERE 
HAS SIMPLY NEVER BEEN A PRECEDENT 
FOR THIS INSIDE ZIMBABWE WE NOW 
HAVE THE OPPOSITION CLAIMING AS 
THEY HAVE SINCE SATURDAY THAT THEY 
HAVE WON A VICTORY FAIR AND SQUARE 
OUTRIGHT THAT THEIR CANDIDATE 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI IS THE NEW LEADER 
AND THEY DO NOT NEED A RUN OFF WE 
HAVE THE OFFICIAL MOUTH PIECE OF 
THE STATE SUGGESTING THAT THE THE 
RUN OFF HAS TO TAKE PLACE AND WE 
HAVE THE COMMISSION CONTINUING TO 
DRIP FEED THE RESULTS AS A GLACIAL 
PACE I THINK IAN IS ABSOLUTELY 
RIGHT THAT THE TENSION WILL NOW BE 
GROWING INSIDE ZIMBABWE VERY 
SIGNIFICANTLY WE HAVE HAD A 
WARNING FROM THE POLICE TELLING 
PEOPLE THAT THEY WILL BE PATROLLING 
COUNTRYWIDE AND APPEALING FOR CALM 
AND ALSO SAYING RATHER OMINOUSLY I 
THINK THAT THEY ARE READY AND ABLE 
TO DEAL WITH THE PERPETRATORS OF 
ANY VIOLENCE THAT WILL SOUND TO 
MANY EARS INSIDE ZIMBABWE AS A 
WARNING TO THE OPPOSITION IT'S 
ONLY SEVEN OR EIGHT MONTHS OF 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI THE OPPOSITION 
LEADER APPEARING OUTSIDE COURT 
WITH BLOOD AND WOUNDS ON HIS FACE 
AFTER A BEATING BY POLICE L. THINK 
THERE WILL NOW BE A GREAT DEAL OF 
TENSION AND WE REALLY ARE IN 
TERRITORY THAT IS VERY VERY 
DIFFICULT TO PREDICT BUT THERE 
WILL BE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE 
POSSIBILITY OF VIOLENCE 
THANK YOU 
THE PRIME MINISTER THE IRISH 
PRIME MINISTER BERTIE AHERN HAS 
ANNOUNCED HE'S TO STAND DOWN NEXT 
MONTH MR. AHERN WHO PLAYED A KEY 
ROLE IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE 
PROCESS HAS MADE SEVERAL 
APPEARANCES BEFORE AN ANTI 
CORRUPTION TRIBUNAL INVESTIGATING 
LINKS BETWEEN POLITICIANS AND 
PROPERTY DEVELOPERS IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES 
HE HAS DENIED ANY WRONGDOING 
WHILE I WOULD BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT 
THAT I'VE MADE HIS TAKES IN MY LIFE 
AND CAREER ONE MISTAKE I'VE NEVER 
MADE WAS TO ENRICH MYSELF BY 
MISUSING THE TRUST OF THE PEOPLE L. 
HAVE NEVER SEECKED A CORRUPT 
PAYMENT 
SOUGHT WHY DID HE FEEL PAYMENT THE NEED TO STEP DOWN 
IT'S A CASE 
OF A DEATH BY ONE THOUSAND CUTS HE'S BEEN 
UNDER PRESSURE FROM THIS TRIBUNAL 
THAT HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING 
ALLEGEDLY CORRUPT PAYMENTS FROM 
BUSINESSMEN TO POLITICIANS JUST 
RECENTLY HIS FORMER SECRETARY 
ADMITTED LODGING PAYMENTS IN 
STERLING WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN 
DENIED AND I THINK RIGHT NOW HE 
FELT THIS WOULDN'T GO AWAY IF THEY 
DIDN'T GIVE 
A DATE THE PRESSURE 
PARTICULARLY FROM THE DUBLIN MEDIA 
WOULD BE RELENTLESS WE HAVE GOT A 
SITUATION WHERE THERE IS STILL A 
LOT OF PRESSURE WITHIN DUBLIN ABOUT 
THIS MAYBE THAT THE BUBBLE HAS 
BEEN BURST WITH THE ANNOUNCE 
INTERNATIONALLY AND HERE IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND PEOPLE ARE PAYING 
TRIBUTE TO HIM AS HIS ROLE AS A 
NEGOTIATOR IN THE GOOD FRIDAY 
AGREEMENT AND THE RESTORATION OF 
DEVOLUTION HERE LAST YEAR IT IS 
UNDOUBTEDLY THE CARE HE PLAYED A 
MAJOR ROLE IN DELIVERING THAT 
THANK YOU 
BRITISH AIRWAYS IS SENDING 
THOUSANDS OF SUITCASES TO ITALY TO 
TRY TO CLEAR THE BAG LOG OF NINETEEN THOUSAND 
BAGS WHICH HAVE BEEN STACKING UP AT 
TERMINAL FIVE AN ITALIAN COURIER FIRM 
AT A SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION CENTRE IN 
MILAN WILL SORT THROUGH THE LUGGAGE 
AND IT WILL BE RETURNED TO AN 
ADDRESS IN CENTRAL EUROPE FIFTY 
FLIGHTS HAVE BEEN CANCELLED TODAY 
AT THE AIRPORT 
MORE BAD NEWS ON THE MORTGAGES THIS 
MORNING THE NUMBER AVAILABLE HAS 
FALLEN BY NEARLY ONE FIFTH OVER THE 
PAST WEEK THE FIGURES FROM THE 
MONEY FACT WEBSITE UNDERLINE THE 
IMPACT OF THE LENDING SQUEEZE ON 
HOME BUYERS HUGH PYM IS WITH ME 
NOW WHAT IS GOING ON 
IT IS 
GETTING HARDER TO GET A MORTGAGE 
IT IS QUITE REMARKABLE THAT NUMBER 
YOU JUST REFERRED TO THERE THE 
NUMBER OF MORTGAGE PRODUCTS ON 
OFFER BELOW FIVE THOUSAND THIS TIME A YEAR 
AGO IT WAS UP NEARLY AT FOURTEEN THOUSAND OR 
ABOVE THAT IN THE MONTHS AFTER 
WHEN CREDIT WAS VERY EASY TO COME 
BY IT IS THAT MUCH HARDER NOW CUE 
STILL GET A MORTGAGE BUT IT WILL BE 
MORE EXPENSIVE WE HAVE LEARNED 
THAT FIRST DIRECT HAS SAID IT WON'T 
PROVIDE ANY MORTGAGES TO NEW 
CUSTOMERS FOR A TIME AT LEAST BUT 
IT'S BEEN SO SWAMPED WITH DEMAND 
FOR ITS RATES WHICH IT SAID WERE 
MORE COMPETITIVE BECAUSE EVERYONE 
ELSE HAS PUT THEIR PRICES UP IT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN UNTHINKABLE A FEW 
MONTHS AGO TO DO THIS 
NEW FIGURES 
OUT TODAY FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
ON BORROWING WHAT DO THEY TELL US 
IT'S COMING UP WITH AN INTRIGUING 
FIGURE THE NUMBER OF MORTGAGE 
APROFLZ IS DOWN NEAR A TEN YEAR LOW 
APROFLZ ON UNSECURED LOANS LIKE 
CREDIT CARDS AND OVERDRAFTS THERE 
HAS BEEN AN INCREASE THAT COULD 
MEAN BECAUSE WE ARE STILL SHOPPING 
AS WE USED TO OR IT COULD MEAN THAT 
PEOPLE ARE FINDING IT HARDER TO GET 
A MORTGAGE TO RAISE A DEPOSIT SO 
THEY ARE HAVING TO GO TO THEIR 
OVERDRAFT OR CARD TO RAISE THE 
MONEY UNSECURED 
THANK YOU 
THE JURY AT THE INQUEST INTO THE 
DEATHS OF DIANA PRINCESS OF WALES 
AND DODI AL FAYED HAS BEGUN 
CONSIDERING ITS VERDICT THE SIX 
WOMEN AND FIVE MEN WILL DELIBERATE

AN ACCIDENT OR UNEXPLAINED OUR 
ROYAL CORRESPONDENT IS OUTSIDE THE

FARMFULS OF FILES OF SOME OF THE 
EVIDENCE OF THE PAST SIX MONTHS 
RETIRED TO TIR ROOM TO BEGIN 
CONSIDERING THEIR VERDICT NOW 
CONCLUDING THE SUMMING UP THE 
CORONER SAID THAT 
MR. AL FAYED SEEMS TO HAVE FALLEN 
BACK ON THE FACT THAT MAYBE 
RENEGADE MEMBERS OF M. I SIX WERE UP TO 
SOMETHING INSTER AND IN RELATION TO 
THAT THE JURY COULD RETURN AN OPEN 
VERDICT THIS IS WHAT THE CORONER 
SAID IN RELATION TO THAT 
THIS POSSIBILITY AS I SAY NOW 
AROUND THE SUGGESTION THAT RENEGADE 
M. I SIX OFFICERS GOT UP TO SOMETHING 
THEN OF COURSE THERE IS THE 
POSSIBILITY OF A VERDICT OF 
UNLAWFUL KILLING BY VIRTUE OF THE 
GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF THE DRIVER OF 
THE MERCEDES HENRI PAUL IN 
ELATION TO THAT THE CORONER SAID 
THIS 
IN LELATION TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT 
THE PAPARAZZI CAUSED THE CRASH THE 
CORONER SAID WAS THERE CONDUCT NOT 
ONLY NEGLIGENT BUT SO GROSSLY 
NEGLIGENT AS TO CROSS THE VERY HIGH 
THRESHOLD TO RETURN A VERDICT OF 
EFFECTIVE MANSLAUGHTER THANK YOU

PROSECUTION WILL OPEN THEIR CASE AS 
SOON AS TOMORROW 
THE TOP STORY THIS LUNCHTIME 
SHANNON MATTHEW'S STEP FATHER HAS

ADVERTS TO PROTECT CHILDREN 
ON B. B. C. LONDON WE TAKE A JOURNEY 
WITH AN OLYMPIC HOPEFUL TO THE HOME 
OF THE GAMES 
AND THE LONDON SOUL SINGER FORCED 
TO LEAVE THE CAPITAL FOR THE U. S. IN 
ORDER TO MAKE IT BIG 
NOW A MEMORIAL SERVICE HAS BEEN 
HELD AT WINDSOR CASTLE FOR THE 
MOUNTEER SIR ED MONDAY HILARY WHO 
DIED THIS YEAR THE QUEEN AND THE 
DUKE OF EDINBURGH WERE AT THE 
CEREMONY IN SAINT GEORGE'S CHAPEL A 
RARE TRIBUTE FROM THE QUEEN WHO 
ATTENDS VERY FEW MEMORIAL SERVICES 
SHE WISHED TO HONOUR SIR EDMUND 
HILARY KNIGHT OF THE GARTER AND 
CONQUERER OF EVEREST AND NEW 
ZEALAND'S MOST FAMOUS SON 
IN SAINT GEORGE'S CHAPEL SIR EDMUND'S 
FAMILY JOINED LEADING FIGURES FROM 
NEW ZEALAND WHERE HE REMAINS A 
HUGE AND INSPIRATIONAL FIGURE SIR SIR EDMUND STOOD TALL AMONGST US LIKE 
NO EVER HE HAD BEEN THE FIRST 
CLIMBER TO CONQUER MOUNT EVEREST 
AND THE FIRST PERSON TO MAKE A LAND 
CROSSING TO THE SOUTH POLE SINCE 
AMUNDSEN AND SCOTT IN THE EARLY 
TWENTIETH CENTURY 
EDMUND HILARY AND 
TENZING NORGAY HIS SHERPA AND 
NEPALESE GUIDE WERE THE FIRST TO

THE HUGE SENSE OF OPTIMISM 
SURROUNDING THE QUEEN'S CORONATION

YOURSELF YOU'RE OVER TILL YOU'RE 
DOWN 
TODAY A LITTLE OF NEW DOWN ZEALAND AT WINDSOR TO HONOUR SIR 
EDMUND HILARY A FIGURE AROUND THE 
WORLD TO CLIMBERS AND NON CLIMBERS 
TOO TOO JEECK DOMINATED PRIME MINISTER'S 
QUESTIONS THIS LUNCHTIME JOKES 
HARRIET HARMAN STOOD IN FOR GORDON 
BROWN AND WILLIAM HAGUE STOOD IN 
FOR DAVID CAMERON 
IT IS AN IMAGE THAT HAS BEEN A GIFT 
TO HER CRITICS LABOUR'S HARRIET 
HARMAN WEARING A STAB PROOF VEST 
WHILE OUT IN HIS CONSTITUENCY TOO 
GOOD FOR HER TORY OPPONENT NOT TO 
BRING UP 
SHE HAS HAD A DIFFICULT 
WEEK AND SHE HAD TO EXPLAIN 
YESTERDAY THAT SHE DRESSES IN 
ACCORDANCE TO WHEREVER SHE GOES 
WEARS A HELMET TO A BUILDING SITE 
AND INDIAN CLOTHES AND PRESUMABLY 
WHEN SHE GOES TO A CABINET MEETING 
SHE DRESSES AS A CLOWN 
BUT MISS 
HARMAN HAD HER AMMUNITION READY I I THINK IF I WAS LOOKING FOR ADVICE 
ON WHAT TO WEAR OR WHAT NOT TO WEAR 
I WOULD NOT LOOK TO THE MAN IN THE 
BASEBALL HAT 
A REFERENCE TO THIS 
AND AN ATTEMPT FOR WILLIAM HAGUE TO 
LOOK YOUTHFUL BUT THAT WAS NOT THE 
END OF THE SNIPING 
I'D LIKE TO 
CONGRATULATE MISS HARMAN AS THE 
FIRST FEMALE EVER TO ANSWER PRIME 
MINISTER'S QUESTIONS SHE MUST BE 
PROUD THREE DECADES ON TO FOLLOW 
IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF MRS. THATCHER 
FOR LABOUR 
IS THIS THAT WOMEN SHOULD BE SEEN 
AND NOT HEARD 
AND THE RESULT WELL 
A SCORE DRAW 
WHAT IS BEST FOR MUMS A HOME BIRTH 
OR A HOSPITAL DELIVERY BY NEXT 
YEAR ALL WOMEN IN ENGLAND HAVE 
BEEN PROMISED A CHOICE OF WHERE TO 
GIVE BIRTH MAKING WEIGHING UP THE 
BEST PLACES EVEN MORE IMPORTANT 
AND TODAY A NEW REPORT LOOKS AT 
THE RISKS OF GIVE BIRTH AT HOME 
JENNY HICKS HAD HER BABY DAUGHTER 
AT HOME MIDWIVES TOLD HER SHE WAS 
A LOW RISK MUM JENNY'S LABOUR WAS 
STRAIGHTFORWARD AND REBECCA ARRIVED 
SAFE AND WELL 
IT ALL HAPPENED VERY 
QUICKLY FROM THE FIRST INDICATIONS 
OF LABOUR AT LUNCHTIME TO WHEN 
REBECCA WAS BORN AT THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE IN THE 
AFTERNOON THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS 
AT ALL 
HAVING A BABY IN THIS 
COUNTRY IS GENERALLY SAFE BUT 
THERE IS LITTLE HARD EVIDENCE ABOUT 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HOME AND 
HOSPITAL HOSPITAL IN THE U. K. ALMOST ALL BABIES ARE 
BORN IN A HOSPITAL ROOM LIKE THIS 
ONLY TWO PER CENT OF BIRTHS ARE AT HOME 
EXPERTS SAY THE MOST IMPORTANT 
THING IS FOR WOMEN TO HAVE THE BEST 
INFORMATION TO MAKE A CHOICE ABOUT 
WHERE TO HAVE THEIR BABY 
TODAY'S RESEARCH ESTIMATES THE RISK 
TO BABIES OF HOME BIRTHS DOCTORS 
SAY IT SUGGESTS THEY ARE HIGHER 
THAN AVERAGE IF THE MOTHER HAS TO 
TRANSFER TO HOSPITAL 
IF YOU CHOOSE 
A HOME BIRTH AND THINGS GO WELL 
IT'S A WONDERFUL OUTCOME FOR BOTH 
THE MOTHER AND THE BABY BUT 
UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS A SMALL 
GROUP WHERE THINGS GO WRONG AND 
FOR THEM SADLY THE OUTCOME MAY BE 
WORSE THAN IF THEY HAD BEEN ON THE 
SPOT IN HOSPITAL FOUR THE 
COMPLICATION OCCURRED 
JENNY WAS 
GIVEN THE N. H. S. SUPPORT SHE NEEDED TO 
HAVE HER BABY AT HOME SUPPORTERS 
OF HOME BIRTH SAY TODAY'S RESEARCH 
SHOULDN'T CHANGE THAT 
I DON'T 
THINK THIS PIECE OF RESEARCH TAKES 
US FORWARD AT ALL WE'VE KNOWN FOR 
A LONG TIME THAT HOME BIRTH IS A 
SAFE OPTION FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE A 
STRAIGHTFORWARD PREGNANCY THAT IS 
STILL THE CASE THESE RESULTS 
SHOULDN'T PUT WOMEN OFF CHOOSING 
WHAT THEY FEEL IS RIGHT FOR THEM 
WOMEN IN ENGLAND ARE BEING PROMISED 
CHOICE ABOUT WHERE TO HAVE THEIR 
BABY THIS WEEK ALL MATERNITY 
UNITS HAVE SIGNED UP TO A BIG NEW 
RESEARCH PROJECT THE RESULT SHOULD 
BE THE FIRST SOLID EVIDENCE ON 
WHICH KIND OF BIRTHPLACE IS SAFEST 
MARY STEWART FROM BIRTH PLACE 
STUDY JOINS US SHE IS PART OF A 
TEAM BEGINNING NEW RESEARCH TO 
ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS RAISED 
BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT WOMEN SHOULD 
TAKE FROM THIS STUDY 
YES IT IS 
RESEARCH AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT 
HAS NOT GENERALLY LOOKED AT 
OUTCOMES FOR WHERE WOMEN PLAN TO 
GIVE BIRTH MOST OF THE RESEARCH 
THAT IS AVAILABLE HAS LOOKED AT 
WHERE WOMEN ACTUALLY GIVE BIRTH SO 
THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THIS QUESTION 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IF WOMEN NEED TO 
TRANSFER FROM HOME INTO HOSPITAL 
FOR ANY REASON SO THE STUDY THAT 
I'M PART OF IS TO LOOK AT WHAT THE 
ACTUAL RISKS ARE IF WOMEN DO NEED 
TO BE TRANSFERRED IN FOR ANY REASON 
HOW DO YOU HOPE THAT WILL HELP 
WOMEN AND INDEED N. H. S. MANAGERS 
OF COURSE 
I THINK IT WILL GIVE 
THEM MORE INFORMATION AND MORE 
INFORMATION MEANS THAT IT IS EASIER 
TO MAKE CHOICES BASED ON GOOD 
EVIDENCE BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT 
THE INFORMATION THAT WE DO HAVE IS 
RATHER PARTIAL TO BE HONEST THERE 
ARE GAPS IN THE EVIDENCE AND THE 
RESEARCH THAT HAS JUST COME OUT HAS 
HIGHLIGHTED THE GAPS THAT THERE ARE 
SO WE ARE VERY GLAD THAT BIRTHPLACE 
WHICH HAS BEEN FUNDED BY THE 
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IS GOING TO 
HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO ANSWER SOME OF 
THE QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE DO STILL 
HAVE 
I KNOW BECAUSE IT IS QUITE HAVE INCREDIBLE ISN'T IT THAT THAT 
INFORMATION IS NOT ALREADY 
AVAILABLE 
YES IT IS A DEBATE THAT AVAILABLE HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR AN AWFULLY 
LONG TIME AND WE'VE KNOWN FOR QUITE 
A WHILE WHAT QUESTIONS STILL NEED 
TO BE ANSWERED AND THE BIRTHPLACE 
STUDY THAT I'M PART OF IT JUST A 
WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER 
THOSE QUESTIONS 
GOOD AND THE 
RESULTS YOU'RE HOPING FOR TWO THOUSAND TEN I 
UNDERSTAND 
THAT'S RIGHT WE'LL UNDERSTAND WE'LL SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN 
IN TWO YEARS' 
TIME TIME THATCH MILLIONS OF CHILDREN ARE 
PUTTING THEMSELVES AT RISK BY 
POSTING PERSONAL DETAILS ON SOCIAL 
NETWORKING SITES IT HAS BEEN FOUND 
THAT QUARTER OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE 
IGNORING AGE RESTRICTIONS POPULAR 
NETWORKING SITES WILL NOW HAVE TO 
DISPLAY NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE EMERGENCY NUMBER FOR 
CHILDREN TO CALL IF THEY FEAR THEY 
ARE AT RISK OF ABUSE 
BEBO.COM ARE A GREAT WAY TO KEEP IN 
TOUCH WITH FRIENDS FAMILY 
HERE IS BEBO BY FAR THE MOST 
POPULAR NETWORK AMONGST CHILDREN 
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO THIRTEEN TO SIGN UP 
BUT THE EVIDENCE IS THAT PLENTY OF 
CHILDREN YOUNGER THAN THAT USE THIS 
AND OTHER NETWORKING SITES OFCOM 
SAYS CHILDREN KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT 
THIS TECHNOLOGY THAN THEIR PARENTS 
AND THAT CAN PROVE DANGEROUS 
TODAY'S RESEARCH SHOWS THAT HALF OF 
ALL CHILDREN IN BRITAIN WHO HAVE 
INTERNET ACCESS HAVE A PROFILE ON A 
SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE THE 
MAJORITY ON BEBO BUT IT ALSO SHOWS 
THAT MILLIONS OF THEM ARE DOING 
NOTHING TO KEEP THOSE PROPOSALS 
PRIVATE AND THAT THEIR PARENTS 
OFTEN UNDERSTAND LITTLE OF THIS 
WORLD IN LONDON'S SCIENCE MUSEUM 
WE FOUND CHILDREN WHO WERE PRETTY 
CLUED UP ABOUT THE NEED FOR PRIVACY 
AND PARENTS WHO CONFESSED TO 
IGNORANCE THIS IS CEILIDH AND HER 
DAD DARREN 
YOU MAKE YOUR PROFILE 
PRIVATE SO STRANGERS CAN'T TALK TO 
YOU AND ONLY FRIENDS CAN SEE YOUR 
PAGE 
AND WERE YOU HAPPY ABOUT YOUR PAGE DAUGHTER'S PROFILE WHEN SHE WENT ON 
BEBO 
I DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT BEBO BEBO EXCEPT THAT OBVIOUSLY IT IS A 
NETWORKING SITE USED BY CHILDREN 
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT HER SETTINGS 
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HER SETTINGS 
ARE FOR BEBO 
THE HOME OFFICE WILL 
SOON UNVEIL A CODE ON SAFER SOCIAL 
NETWORKING A DRAFT VERSION SAYS 
I THINK IT IS ABOUT TAKING 
RESPONSIBILITY AND IT IS THE 
INTERNET PROVIDERS THEMSELVES THE 
PEOPLE WHO RUN THESE SITES ALONG 
WITH PARENTS JUST BEING MORE AWARE 
OF THESE ISSUES AND FINDING WAYS TO 
TAKE GREATER RESPONSIBILITY 
BECAUSE IN THE END IT IS ABOUT 
PROTECTING CHILDREN SOCIAL SOCIAL NETWORKING IS PROVIDING CHILDREN 
WITH NEW SKILLS AND ENTERTAINMENT 
BUT THERE IS NOW MOUNTING PRESSURE 
TO GIVE THEM GREATER PROTECTION 
THE ROYAL MINT HAS REVEALED THE NEW 
DESIGNS WHICH WILL FEATURE ON THE 
REVERSE OF SEVEN BRITISH COINS THE 
DESIGNS FOR THE COINS ARE THE FIRST 
MASS CHANGE TO THE COUNTRY'S 
COINAGE SINCE DECIMALISATION WAS 
INTRODUCED IN APRIL NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT LET'S 
TURN TO THE WEATHER NOW AND PETER 
IT IS LOOKING PRETTY CLOUDY AT THE 
MOMENT BUT IT IS MILD ACROSS MOST 
PARTS OF THE U. K. IT IS FEELING LIKE 
SPRING HAS GOT MORE INTO ITS STRIDE 
FOR THE TIME BEING BUT IT WON'T 
LAST AND MORE COLD WEATHER IS ON 
THE WAY FOR THE WEEKEND 
SO CLOUDY SKIES AND IT IS MILD 
BECAUSE THE CLOUD IS FEEDING IN 
FROM THE ATLANTIC YOU CAN SEE IS 
DRIFTING IN FROM THE SOUTH WEST 
BUT A LOT OF CLOUD AROUND WITH ONE 
OR TWO EXCEPTIONS SOUTHERN PARTS 
OF CORNWALL AND DORSET HAVE BEEN 
ENJOYING SUNSHINE BUT IT TURNS 
DULL AND DREARY THROUGH THE BRISTOL 
CHANNEL AND ACROSS WALES FOR THE 
AFTERNOON LITTLE BRIGHTNESS FOR 
NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE THICKER 
CLOUD WITH OUTBREAKS OF RAIN IS 
NUDGING IN ACROSS THE WESTERN SIDE 
OF SCOTLAND BUT THE FURTHER EAST 
YOU ARE YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE OF 
HANGING ON TO DRIER AND SUNNIER 
WEATHER THIS AFTERNOON AND 
TEMPERATURES ARE ABOVE AVERAGE FOR 
THE TIME OF YEAR IN THE NORTH OF 
ENGLAND THE BRIGHTER SKIES ARE TO 
THE EAST OF THE COUNTRY AND DOWN TO 
LINCOLNSHIRE AS WELL BUT THIS BAND 
OF RAIN HAS THICKER CLOUD BRINGING 
PATCHY RAIN AND IT WILL BE DAMP 
FROM CHESHIRE ALL THE WAY TO LONDON 
AND THE SOUTH EAST CLOUDY SKIES 
TONIGHT AND FOG TURNING UP IN WALES 
AND THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND IN 
PARTICULAR BUT LOOK AT THE 
TEMPERATURES SEVEN TO NINE DEGREES 
A VERY MILD NIGHT NO SIGNS OF 
FROST ANYWHERE BUT IT MEANS A GREY 
START TO TOMORROW PATCHEO RAIN 
ACROSS THE NORTH AND NORTH WEST OF 
SCOTLAND AND ELSEWHERE NO MORE 
THAN THE ODD SPOT OF DRIZZLE AND BY 
THE AFTERNOON A BETTER CHANCE OF 
HOLES APPEARING IN THE CLOUD SHEET 
AND WITH LIGHT WINDS IT WILL FEEL 
VERY MILD 
ANOTHER MILD DIE AN FRIDAY BUT 
THIS BAND OF RAIN HERALDS THE START 
OF CHANGE WITH COLDER CONDITIONS 
COMING IN BEHIND IT AND THE WINDS
