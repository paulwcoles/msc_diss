VOTERS WILL JUDGE US ON 
I MUST 
HAVE CANVASSED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
LONDONERS AS A COUNCILLOR AND AS 
AN M. P. AND AS MAYOR NOBODY EVER 
SAYS I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR 
PRIVATE LIFE 
THE POLL THAT 
SUGGESTS MORE THAN HALF OF 
LONDONERS DON'T THINK THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
OLYMPICS WILL BENEFIT THEM 
GRATEFUL TO BE ALIVE THE COUPLE 
WHOSE HOME WAS DESTROYED BY A PLANE 
SPEAK OF THEIR SHOCK 
PLUS WE MEET THE LATEST LONDON 
RESIDENTS SETTLING IN TO THEIR NEW 
HOME 
WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMME 
WE START TONIGHT WITH EXTRAORDINARY 
REVELATIONS ABOUT KEN LIVINGSTONE'S 
PRIVATE LIFE THE MAYOR HAS BEEN 
APPEARING AT PUBLIC EVENTS WITH HIS 
PARTNER AND TWO SMALL CHILDREN THE 
B. B. C. HAS LEARNED MR. LIVINGSTONE IN 
FACT HAS A TOTAL OF FIVE CHILDREN 
BY THREE DIFFERENT PARTNERS HE 
TOLD US TODAY THAT HE NEVER HAS AND 
NEVER WILL DISCUSS HIS PRIVATE LIFE 
WITH LESS THAN A MONTH TO GO BEFORE 
MILLIONS OF LONDONERS GO TO THE 
POLLS HE CONCEDED TODAY THE 
REVELATIONS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE 
USED TO ATTACK HIM LET'S CROSS TO 
TIM DONOVAN WHO IS AT CITY HALL FOR 
THE FULL STORY 
A FEW WEEKS AGO KEN LIVINGSTONE 
SAID HE WAS CONCERNED HE KNEW THAT 
SOME JOURNALISTS SOME POLITICAL 
OPPONENTS WOULD BE COMING FOR HIM 
AND THEY WOULD BE LOOKING AND WERE 
LOOKING AT HIS PRIVATE LIFE TODAY 
IT'S BECOME CLEAR WHY HE SAID THAT 
MANY PEOPLE WILL KNOW THAT KEN 
LIVINGSTONE HAS TWO YOUNG CHILDREN 
BY HIS PARTNER SHE WORKS HERE AT 
CITY HALL WITH KEN LIVINGSTONE WE 
HAVE LEARNED THAT HE HAS THREE 
OLDER CHILDREN FROM PREVIOUS 
RELATIONSHIPS TWO GIRLS TWO 
SISTERS FROM ONE MOTHER ONE BOY 
FROM ANOTHER PARTNER THE MAYOR 
DOES NOT DENY THIS IT HAS BECOME 
APPARENT OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS 
THAT AT LEAST ONE NATIONAL 
NEWSPAPER WAS GETTING CLOSE TO 
PUBLISHING DETAILS AND CERTAINLY 
SOME OF THE PEOPLE AROUND KEN 
LIVINGSTONE IN HIS CAMPAIGN TEAM 
AND SO ON WERE GROWING INCREASINGLY 
CONCERNED AT THE IMPACT THAT THIS 
MIGHT HAVE AT THIS CRUCIAL TIME 
LESS THAN A MONTH AWAY FROM THIS 
CRUCIAL ELECTION TODAY IN AN 
INTERVIEW I ASKED KEN LIVINGSTONE 
FOR HIS RESPONSE 
THE SAME RESPONSE 
AS I HAVE HAD RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH 
ALL THE LAST THIRTY YEARS I DON'T TALK 
ABOUT MY PRIVATE LIFE IT SEEMS 
LIKE ONLY YESTERDAY THE PRESS WAS 
TRYING TO IMPLY THAT I WAS GAY L. 
SPENT YEARS PEOPLE ASKING I 
THOUGHT YOU WERE GAY I HAVE NEVER 
DISCUSSED MY PRIVATE LIFE 
YOU HAVE 
BEEN AN INVOLVED FATHER BUT YOU 
KNOW WHEN THESE DETAILS EMERGE THAT 
THE LIKELIHOOD IS YOU ARE GOING TO 
BE PRESENTED AS AND PEOPLE WILL 
ACCUSE YOU OF BEING IRRESPONSIBLE 
OF DOUBTING YOUR MORALS WELL WELL PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT MY MORALS 
THEN WHAT AM I DOING THAT IS 
IMMORAL WHAT HAPPENS IN MY PRIVATE 
LIFE IS FOR ME AND FOR THOSE THAT 
SHARE MY PRIVATE LIFE 
DOES IT NOT 
MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU YOU 
HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE LACK OF 
PARENTING AND THE MORAL ISSUES 
THAT IS THE REASON FOR THE CAUSE OF 
CRIME WON'T THAT LOOK 
HYPOCRITICAL 
NO I'M QUITE HAPPY HYPOCRITICAL WITH MY PRIVATE LIFE THE PEOPLE 
THAT HAVE SHARED MY PRIVATE LIFE I 
DON'T SEE ANY COMPLAINTS FROM THAT 
ALL THE PEOPLE THAT DID SHARE MY 
LIFE AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER DID SO 
ON THE BASIS IT WAS PRIVATE BETWEEN 
US 
SO FOR IT TO EMERGE BECAUSE US JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN LOOKING INTO 
THIS ASPECT OF IT DO YOU THINK IT 
WILL BE USED HARMFULLY AGAINST YOU 
JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN LOOKING INTO 
MY PRIVATE LIFE FOR FORTY YEARS THEY 
HAVE BROKEN INTO MY BANK ACCOUNT 
WHICH IS A CRIMINAL OFFENCE NO ONE 
HAS EVER FOUND ANYTHING THAT WAS 
ILLEGAL OR IMMORAL IF YOU WANT TO 
ASK ME QUESTIONS ABOUT ANYTHING 
THAT'S LEGAL I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER 
ALL THAT THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE 
SHARED MY LIFE I'M GOING TO 
CONTINUE TO RESPECT THEIR RIGHT TO 
PRIVACY I'M NOT GOING TO JOIN NICK 
CLEGG IN DISCUSSING THE DETAILS OF 
WHO I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE SLEPT 
WITH OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS YOU YOU ACCEPT THAT SOME PEOPLE WILL BE 
SHOCKED AND OTHERS WILL BE ANGRY 
CAN I JUST SAY I DON'T THINK 
ANYBODY IS SHOCKED ABOUT WHAT 
CONSENTING ADULTS DO AS LONG AS 
YOU DON'T INVOLVE CHILDREN ANIMALS 
AND VEGETABLES THEY LEAVE PEOPLE 
TO GET ON WITH THEIR OWN LIFE 
THERE IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRIVATE 
AND SECRET IF I HAD SECRETS THAT 
MY FAMILY OR MY CLOSE FRIENDS 
DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT WOULD BE 
ANOTHER MATTER THERE IS 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRIVATE AND 
SECRET THE MEDIA HAS TO UNDERSTAND 
THAT 
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THE THAT IMPACT THE PUBLICITY MAY HAVE ON 
YOUR PARTNERS 
THERE IS NOTHING 
THAT IS NOT KNOWN TO MY PARTNER MY 
FAMILY OR MY CLOSE FRIENDS THEY 
JUST ACCEPT MY PRIVATE LIFE IS MY 
PRIVATE LIFE 
YOU SAID EARLIER THIS 
WEEK THAT YOUR PARENTS GAVE YOU THE 
GIFT OF GUILT DO YOU FEEL GUILT 
ABOUT THIS 
WELL I DON'T FEEL 
GUILT ABOUT ANYTHING L. HAVE DONE 
EITHER IN MY PUBLIC LIFE OR MY 
PRIVATE LIFE THERE ARE THINGS YOU 
WOULD GO BACK AND DO DIFFERENTLY 
THERE ARE A LOT OF POLITICAL 
DECISIONS I WOULD TAKE DIFFERENTLY 
I ALWAYS RESPECTED THE FACT THAT 
PEOPLE THAT CHOSE TO BE PART OF MY 
PRIVATE LIFE OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS 
HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT I'M NOT 
GOING TO BE DRONING ON ABOUT IT ON 
YOUR T. V. PROGRAMME OR IN A NEWSPAPER 
THAT IS WHAT PRIVATE MEANS WOULD WOULD YOU AT LEAST ACCEPT THAT YOUR 
POLITICAL OBSESSION YOUR POLITICAL 
CAREER HAS IMPACTED ON YOUR 
PERSONAL LIFE 
NO NO NOTHING IN 
MY POLITICAL LIFE I HAVE ALLOWED TO 
IMPACT ON MY PRIVATE LIFE PEOPLE 
IN YOUR PRIVATE LIFE HAVE A RIGHT 
TO EXPECT THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING 
TO COME SECOND TO YOUR POLITICAL 
LIFE THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE YOU YOU HAVE TO YOUR MIND YOU DON'T SEE 
THE LEGITIMACY OF IN VOTERS' MINDS 
THAT THEY CANNOT SEPARATE THE 
PERSONAL FROM THE POLITICAL THEY 
NEED TO SEE THE WHOLE MAN 
I MUST 
HAVE CANVASSED PERSONALLY TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF LONDONERS BOTH AS A 
COUNCILLOR AS AN M. P. AND AS MAYOR 
NOBODY EVER SAYS I WANT TO KNOW 
ABOUT YOUR PRIVATE LIFE 
OCCASIONALLY PEOPLE SAY HOW ARE 
THE KIDS THAT IS THE MOST IT EVER 
GOES I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT 
WITH THE MEDIA I'M NOT MY PRIVATE 
LIFE IS NOT MY SOLE PROPERTY IT'S 
BEEN SHARED WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND 
THEY EXPECTED IT TO STAY PRIVATE 
AND IT IS GOING TO STAY PRIVATE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
TIM KEN LIVINGSTONE MAKING IT VERY 
CLEAR THERE THIS IS HIS PRIVATE 
LIFE WHAT DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WILL 
FEEL ABOUT THIS 
I THINK THAT IS 
GENUINELY IMPOSSIBLE TO CALL THERE 
IS A POLL IN THE NATIONAL THE 
GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER WHICH HAS BEEN 
SEEN BY KEN LIVINGSTONE AS VERY 
GOOD NEWS HE WAS ONE PER CENT BEHIND BORIS 
JOHNSON THERE WAS SOMETHING OF 
CONCERN IN THAT IT SUGGESTED 
DOUBTS OVER HIS HONESTY AND PROBETY 
ONLY TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT OF THOSE PEOPLE BEING 
QUESTIONED SAID THEY THOUGHT HE WAS 
THE MOST HONEST UNDOUBTEDLY SOME 
PEOPLE WILL SEE THIS AS HARMFUL TO 
HIM THEY WILL SEE IT IS DAMAGING 
THEY WILL SAY IT SHOWS HE IS NOT 
SOMEONE TO BE TRUSTED IT IS 
COMPLETELY IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT 
THAT THERE WILL BE MANY OTHER 
PEOPLE WHO TAKE THE OPPOSITE VIEW 
EVEN IN THE HEATED ENVIRONMENT 
ATMOSPHERE OF THIS ELECTION 
CAMPAIGN A VERY CLOSELY FOUGHT 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN A POLITICAL 
FIGURE IS ENTITLED TO KEEP THEIR 
PRIVATE LIFE PRIVATE ESPECIALLY 
PARTICULARLY WHEN THEY ARE NOT 
MAKING ISSUES OF PERSONAL MORALITY 
SOMETHING THAT THEY ARE MAKING A 
PITCH TO THE VOTERS AND THAT AS 
YOU HAVE SEEN AND AS YOU HAVE HEARD 
IS KEN LIVINGSTONE'S POSITION THAT THAT SAID WILL THIS HAVE AN IMPACT ON 
THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN 
WELL AGAIN 
I THINK THAT IS GENUINELY 
IMPOSSIBLE TO CALL AS WELL TO SAY 
FOR SURE PARTLY FOR THE REASONS I 
HAVE JUST GIVEN BUT BECAUSE 
QUESTIONS OF CHARACTER OF PERSONAL 
MORALITY GO TO ALL POLITICIANS THE 
SAME POLL TODAY SUGGESTS THAT WOMEN 
VOTERS HAVE MORE CONCERNS ABOUT 
BORIS JOHNSON FOR INSTANCE HE 
LAGGED BEHIND KEN LIVINGSTONE IN 
HIS APPEAL TO THOSE VOTERS SOME 
SPECULATE THAT IS BECAUSE THERE 
HAVE BEEN REVELATIONS ABOUT HIM IN 
THE PAST IN NEWSPAPERS THE ONLY 
THING ONE CAN SAY NOW TONIGHT 
SAFELY AND I THINK THIS IS 
SOMETHING THAT KEN LIVINGSTONE KNEW 
WOULD EMERGE IS THAT THE QUESTION 
OF PERSONAL MORALITY AND ALL SIDES 
OF POLITICIANS' LIVES ALL SIDES OF 
THE CANDIDATES' LIVES WILL NOW 
BECOME AN ISSUE OF SOME DESCRIPTION 
IN THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN 
MANY THANKS FOR THAT 
YOU CAN SEE TIM'S INTERVIEW WITH 
KEN LIVINGSTONE ON OUR WEBSITE GO 
TO BBCCO.UK SLASH LONDON WHERE YOU CAN 
ALSO FIND A FULL LIST OF ALL THE 
CANDIDATES STANDING IN THE MAYORAL 
ELECTION ELECTION PLENTY MORE AHEAD 
YOU DON'T HAVE 
TO BE LIVING IN A CERTAIN AREA ANY 
MORE TO BE IN A GANG 
THE COMPUTER GAME DESIGNED BY 
LONDON CHILDREN TO TRY TO COMBAT 
GANG CULTURE 
MORE THAN HALF OF ALL LONDONERS 
CAN'T SEE THE BENEFIT OF HOSTING 
THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OLYMPICS ACCORDING TO A 
POLL COMMISSIONED BY THE B. B. C. IT 
FOUND ALMOST SIX OUT OF TEN PEOPLE 
LIVING IN THE CAPITAL ARE SCEPTICAL 
ABOUT THE GAMES AND AREN'T 
CONVINCED THEY WILL HAVE A POSITIVE 
EFFECT ON THEIR COMMUNITY 
LONDON 
WE'VE DONE IT 
WE WILL WORK LONDON TO MAXIMISE THE BENEFIT IN EVERY 
REGION IN EVERY COMMUNITY OUR OUR OLYMPIC GURUS KEEP TALKING AT US 
BUT MANY DON'T HEAR A WORD THEY ARE 
SAYING OUR POLLS SUGGEST LONDONERS 
DON'T BELIEVE THE PROMISES THAT THE 
GAMES ARE FOR EVERYONE 
GAMES ARE FOR EVERYONE 
IT SAYS 
ONLY FOUR OUT OF TEN PEOPLE IN THE 
CAPITAL THINK TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WILL BE OF ANY 
NOTICEABLE BENEFIT TO THEM THE THE BIGGEST GAMES EVENT IN THE WORLD 
WHAT CAN WE GET OUT OF THE OLYMPICS 
APART FROM A LOT OF BILLS 
YOU WOULD EXPECT PEOPLE A LONG WAY 
FROM THE CAPITAL TO BE PESSIMISTIC 
THE FIGURES FOR THE REST OF THE 
COUNTRY ARE WORSE THERE THREE OUT 
OF FOUR BRITS THINK THEIR REGION 
WILL GET NO REAL BENEFIT FROM TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
BUT IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE SUCH 
GLOOM IN PARIS OR MADRID IF THEY 
HAD WON SO OLYMPICS MINISTER IS 
THIS TALK OF GAMES FOR EVERYONE 
AN EMPTY SOUNDBITE 
I THINK YOUR 
QUESTIONS ARE ENTIRELY LEGITIMATE 
WE ARE NOT IDIOTS WE HAVE THOUGHT 
VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE DURING AND 
AFTER THE BIDDING PROCESS ABOUT 
GETTING THE VERY BEST VALUE FOR 
MONEY WE HAVE ALSO GIVEN MORE 
THOUGHT AND CAREFUL PLANNING THAN 
ANY OTHER CITY HAS EVER DONE BEFORE 
IN MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ALL 
ROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE A PART IN 
THE GAMES AND BENEFIT FROM THE 
GAMES 
ARE WE GOLD MEDAL GAMES MISERABLEISTS THIS POLL IS 
DEPRESSING FOR LONDON TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHAT 
PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT THEIR 
SALESMANSHIP IS THANKS BUT NO 
SALESMANSHIP IS THANKS BUT NO THANKS WE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR 
YOUR VIEWS ON THIS TODAY ERIC 
BRIGHTWELL SAID TED WYNNE SAYS 
HOW DO YOU FEEL WILL THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
OLYMPICS BENEFIT LONDONERS DO KEEP 
YOUR VIEWS COMING TO 
YOURLONDON AT B. B. C. DOT CO DOT U. K.. YOURLONDON AT B. B. C. DOT CO DOT U. K. NOW WITHIN THE LAST FEW MINUTES WE 
ARE GETTING REPORTS THAT THE 
SUPERMODEL NAOMI CAMPBELL HAVE BEEN 
REMOVED BY POLICE ON A B. A. FLIGHT AT 
HEATHROW AIRPORT IT IS ALLEGED SHE 
ASSAULTED A POLICE OFFICER AT 
TERMINAL FIVE 
A TUBE STRIKE PLANNED FOR EARLY 
NEXT WEEK HAS BEEN CALLED OFF 
LONDON UNDERGROUND WORKERS HAD BEEN 
THREATENING TO WALK OUT FOR SEVENTY TWO 
HOURS FROM SUNDAY EVENING TALKS 
BETWEEN UNIONS AND BOSSES HAVE 
RESOLVED THE DISPUTE 
A SIXTY SIX YEAR OLD MAN HAS BEEN KILLED 
WHILE MINDING A SHOP FOR FRIENDS IN 
EAST LONDON HE WAS FOUND WITH STAB 
WOUNDS AT THE STORE ON HORNS ROAD 
IN ILFORD AT EIGHT HUNDRED P. M. YESTERDAY 
POLICE SAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN A 
ROBBERY THAT WENT WRONG 
THE ENGLISH DEMOCRATS PARTY 
LAUNCHED THEIR MAYORAL CAMPAIGN 
TODAY BY HIGHLIGHTING CONCERNS OVER 
YOUTH VIOLENCE THE PARTY STAGED A 
SYMBOLIC PROTEST DELIVERING A BATH 
OF RED WATER TO CITY HALL TO 
REPRESENT THE BLOOD OF TEENAGERS 
KILLED ON LONDON'S STREETS I'M I'M PARTICULARLY CONCERNED WITH WHAT'S 
HAPPENING TO OUR CITY'S CHILDREN 
OUR KIDS ARE KILLING KIDS LONDON 
USED TO BE PAVED WITH GOLD THEY 
ARE NOW PAVED WITH THE BLOOD OF OUR 
CHILDREN SOMEBODY NOW NEEDS TO 
MAKE A STAND TO STOP THIS BLOODBATH 
THE COUPLE WHO IS HOUSE WAS 
DESTROYED IN THE FARNBOROUGH AIR 
CRASH HAVE SAID THEY ARE GRATEFUL 
TO BE ALIVE THEY WENT TO SEE THE 
WRECKAGE OF THEIR HOME TODAY ALL 
FIVE PEOPLE ON BOARD THE PRIVATE 
JET DIED WHEN IT CAME DOWN IN KENT 
ON SUNDAY 
THEIR HOME MAY BE DEVASTATED BUT 
PATRICIA AND ED HARMAN'S THOUGHTS 
WERE FOR THOSE WHO HAD DIED HERE 
THEY LAID THEIR OWN FLOWERS NEXT TO 
THOSE FROM THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES I I JUST FEEL SO SAD FOR THE PILOT AND 
ALL THE PEOPLE 
THE OTHER PEOPLE 
ON THE PLANE 
THE PARENTS YOU KNOW 
ALL THE FAMILIES THE CHILDREN 
EVERYBODY YOU KNOW L. KNOW THAT 
PILOT WAS DOING HIS BEST TO FIND A 
PLACE TO LAND SAFELY 
THE COUPLE 
WERE ON HOLIDAY WHEN THE PLANE HIT 
SO UNUSUALLY FOR A SUNDAY AFTERNOON 
THE HOUSE WAS EMPTY 
I THINK IT WAS 
FATE TOO THAT THE HOUSE IT HIT WAS 
THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS UNOCCUPIED 
ALL THESE HAVE GOT FAMILIES ALL 
THE HOUSES HERE SO INCREDIBLE 
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE 
THERE IS NO 
ESCAPING THE SHOCK OF SEEING THEIR 
HOME LIKE THIS THEY MOVED IN TWENTY 
YEARS AGO WHEN THE HOUSE WAS BUILT 
AND HAD THEIR WEDDING RECEPTION 
HERE 
WE'D MADE A LOVELY LIFE HERE WE 
HAD ALL OUR FRIENDS AROUND US OUR 
NEIGHBOURS AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN 
HAVE LIVED HERE IT WAS SO LOVELY 
WITH THE WOODS BEHIND AND 
EVERYTHING IT WAS FIVE DREAM BUT BUT WHAT REALLY MATTERS TO THEM IS THAT 
THEY AND THEIR FAMILY ARE SAFE 
WE'RE SO LUCKY IN THE WAY THAT 
WE'RE ALIVE AND WE WANT TO GO TO 
THE CHURCH AND THANK GOD THAT WE 
ARE ALIVE AND RE BUILD AND JUST BE 
GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE THINGS CHA 
WE'VE GOT NOW OUR CHILDREN AND 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS 
OVER THE NEXT 
FEW DAYS WHAT REMAINS OF THEIR HOME 
WILL BE DEMOLISHED WHAT HAPPENS TO 
THE SITE IS THEN UP TO THE INSURERS 
AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITY IF THEY DO 
DECIDE TO RE BUILD HERE THE ARMANS 
SAY THEY WILL NEED SOME TIME YET TO 
CONSIDER WHETHER THEY WILL RETURN 
STILL TO COME 
JOIN ME IN A HOT AND 
HUMID BUTTERFLY SANCTUARY WHICH IS 
ALMOST UNBELIEVABLY OPENING RIGHT 
IN THE HEART OF LONDON 
A GROUP OF LONDON TEENAGERS HAS 
PRODUCED A COMPUTER GAME WARNING 
ABOUT THE DANGERS OF KNIFE CRIME 
THE GAME CALLED SCAN SOLE SATISFY 
CONTROL IS PART OF A OUT GROUP 
ONE EX GANG MEMBER SAYS HE HOPES IT 
WILL HELP YOUNG CHILDREN TO MAKE 
THE RIGHT CHOICES GUN AND KNIFE 
CRIME AMONGST CHILDREN IN THE 
CAPITAL IS CONSTANTLY IN THE 
HEADLINES BUT WITH MORE AND MORE 
YOUNG PEOPLE BECOMING THE 
PERPETRATORS OF CRIME AND THE 
VICTIMS THEY ARE NOW TAKING ACTION 
THESE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE MADE 
LIFE LIKE COMPUTER GAME WHICH 
REFLECTS LIFE ON THE CAPITAL'S 
STREETS YOU FORM A GANG AND CREATE 
PEER PRESSURES THAT OFTEN DRAW 
PEOPLE INTO LIVES OF CRIME THIS 
EX GANG MEMBER WHO DIDN'T WANT US 
TO USE HIS REAL NAME HAS BEEN IN 
AND OUT OF PRISON AFTER GETTING 
INVOLVED WITH A SOUTH LONDON GANG 
THE GAME IS ONE THAT I HOPE PEOPLE 
CAN LEARN TO MAKE CHOICES FROM 
BECAUSE OUT ON THE STREET IT IS 
HARD TO MAKE CHOICES AND YOU DON'T 
HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO MAKE CHOICES 
BUT MAYBE BY PLAYING THIS GAME 
PEOPLE WILL HAVE THE TIME TO MAKE 
THE CHOICES 
HE SAYS ANYTHING THAT 
WILL HELP YOUNG PEOPLE TO STEER 
CLEAR OF GANGS IS DESPERATELY 
NEEDED 
IT IS WORRYING AT HOW EASY NEEDED IT IS TO START GETTING INVOLVED IN 
GANG CULTURE AND START LIVING THAT 
KIND OF LIFE YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
LIVE IN A CERTAIN AREA TO BE IN A 
GANG IT'S EVERYWHERE NOW 
WE NEED 
TO DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO START 
REACHING OUT TO PEOPLE AND ENGAGE 
THEM ON IN ISSUE AND HOPEFULLY 
COMPUTER GAMES COULD BE FIVE WAY OF 
DOING THAT 
SO WHAT DO THE PEOPLE 
IT IS AIMED AT ACTUALLY THINK 
YOU HAVE BEEN PLAYING THIS FOR THE 
FIRST TIME WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT 
I THINK THE STYLE IS SIMPLISTIC SO 
I THINK IT SHOULD BE TO A YOUNGER 
AUDIENCE OVERALL 
DO YOU THINK THIS 
GLAMORISES LIFE ON THE STREETS OF 
LONDON 
I DON'T THINK IT GLAMORISES LONDON LIFE ON THE STREETS BUT THE GAME 
HAS A LOT OF SLANG AND PEOPLE FROM 
LONDON CAN RELATE TO 
IT IS ALL 
ABOUT CRIME AND GANGS AND ALL OF 
THAT 
IT IS HOPED THAT THE GAME CAN THAT BE DEVELOPED AND USED AS AN 
EDUCATIONAL TOOL THROUGHOUT SCHOOLS 
IN THE CAPITAL 
A MAN FROM HERTFORDSHIRE HAS 
LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN TO STOP A MAN 
GOING BLIND IN ONE EYE AFTER SEEING 
A REPORT ABOUT HIM ON THIS 
PROGRAMME EDDIE MEATON'S N. H. S. TRUST 
SAYS HE DOESN'T BELIEVE HE WILL 
BENEFIT FROM TREATMENT BUT MARK 
FRASER BELIEVES OTHERWISE 
I CAN'T 
BELIEVE IT IT IS SO KIND 
HE HAS 
BEEN HAND THAT LIFELINE AND EDDIE 
MEATON IS EXTREMELY GRATEFUL 
SAINT ALBANS BUSINESSMAN MARK FRASER 
HAS LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN STARTING 
WITH ONE THOUSAND TO BEGIN A FUND TO 
HELP WITH EDDIE'S EYE DISEASE I I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BOOK SOME 
TREATMENT WHICH PRIOR TO THAT I 
COULDN'T DO BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GOT 
THAT SORT OF MONEY 
THE SEVENTY FOUR YEAR OLD 
GRANDFATHER HAS WET RMD IN HIS 
RIGHT EYE WHICH IS DETERIORATING 
RAPIDLY RAPIDLY HIS CONSULTANT HAS RECOMMENDED 
TREATMENT BUT THE N. H. S. WON'T PAY 
MARK FRASER SAW HIS CASE ON THIS 
PROGRAMME AND WAS SHOCKED 
IT MAKES 
ME ANGRY THAT A PERSON WHO HAS PUT 
ALL THIS MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM AND 
NEEDS THE TREATMENT AND CAN'T GET 
IT IT IS WRONG 
THE PRIMARY CARE 
TRUST SAID 
EDDIE HAS BEEN TOLD BY HIS 
CONSULTANT THAT DRUG INJECTIONS 
COULD HELP 
HE THOUGHT IT WOULD STABILISE IT 
AND THERE COULD BE A VERY VERY 
SLIGHT CHANCE IT COULD IMPROVE IT 
SLIGHTLY 
MR. MEATON SHOULD GET SLIGHTLY TREATMENT NOW HIS CONSULTANT SAYS 
HE WILL BENEFIT NICE GUIDELINES 
SAY THAT HE SHOULD BE TREATED IF 
HE LIVED SOMEWHERE ELSE LIKE 
BROMLEY HE WOULD GET TREATED 
WITHOUT ANY QUESTIONS ASKED 
EDDIE'S P. C. T. SAYS IT WILL CONSIDER 
THE NEW GUIDELINES IN THE FUTURE 
BUT WITH TIME RUNNING OUT EDDIE 
CAN'T WAIT AND IS NOW HOPING TO 
START PRIVATE CARE WITHIN DAY 
PART OF THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM 
HAS COME TO LIFE IF YOU LIKE IT 
HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO 
TROPICAL PARADISE FOR A LIVE 
EXHIBITION HUNDREDS OF BUTTERFLIES 
ARE ON SHOW AND ASSAD IS THERE 
LOOK AT THIS I'M IN CENTRAL LONDON 
BUT IT LOOKS AS IF I COULD BE 
SOMEWHERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BUT 
IAM AT THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM 
NORMALLY WHEN WE'RE HERE WE'RE 
DOING STORIES ABOUT DEAD CREATURES 
BUT THESE COULDN'T BE MORE ALIVE 
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF BUTTERFLIES 
IN THIS SANCTUARY HERE THEY ARE 
NOT FLUTTERING AROUND AS MUCH AS 
THEY WERE EARLIER TODAY BECAUSE 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT THEY'RE HAVING A 
REST LET'S LOOK AT THESE ONES 
HAVING DINNER THERE ARE 
BUTTERFLIES FROM AT LEAST THREE 
DIFFERENT CONTINENTS IN THIS 
SANCTUARY THEY HAVE CREATED A HOT 
AND HUMID ENVIRONMENT HENCE THE 
SHIRT BUT THIS IS NOT THE ONLY 
CHANGE THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES 
OUTSIDE IN WINTER IT WAS AN ICE 
RINK NOW A BUTTERFLY GARDEN STANDS 
OUTSIDE THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM 
THESE ARE ALL PLANTS THAT ATTRACT 
THE DELICATE CREATURES TO OUR 
GARDENS TENTACLES IN THE MAIZE 
SHOW THE OBSTACLES THE BUTTERFLIES 
FACE IN THE REAL WORLD AND A PUPA 
LEADS TO A AN EMERGING BUTTERFLY 
IS THIS AN INTERESTING PLACE IN YES YES AND BUTTERFLIES CAN BE SEEN 
SPREADING THEIR WINGS FOR THE FIRST 
TIME 
WE THOUGHT WE COULD HAVE A TIME LIVE BUTTERFLY HOUSE FULL OF 
AMAZING BUTTERFLIES TO ENGAGE AND 
AMAZE OUR VISITORS AND THEN 
HOPEFULLY THEY'LL GO TO THE MUSEUM 
TO SEE MORE 
I'VE BEEN FINDING OUT 
AMAZING FACTS AND FIGURES ABOUT 
BUTTERFLIES AS HUMANS WE HAVE 
OVER SIX HUNDRED MUSCLES IN US BUTTERFLIES 
WHEN THEY START OFF AS CATERPILLARS 
HAVE AROUND FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THEM AND 
THEY CAN TASTE FOOD THROUGH THEIR 
FEET THE ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN 
ESPECIALLY CREATED FOR THE HUNDREDS 
OF BUTTERFLIES THAT COME FROM 
AFRICA ASIA AND AMERICA AND YOU 
CAN COME AND SEE THEM AT ANY TIME 
UNTIL AUGUST THE AMAZING THING 
ABOUT THE BUTTERFLIES IS THEY ARE 
SURPRISINGLY COMFORTABLE AROUND 
HUMANS AND IF YOU ARE VERY GENTLE 
YOU CAN PICK THEM UP TOO THE DOORS 
ARE OPEN ON SATURDAY AND THE MUSEUM 
IS EXPECTING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO 
WALK THROUGH AND SEE THESE 
BEAUTIFUL CREATURES 
TIME FOR A CHECK ON THE WEATHER 
GENERALLY SPEAKING NOT A BAD DAY 
TODAY WITH GLIMPSES OF SUNSHINE AND 
FEELING QUITE PLEASANT FOR THIS 
TIME OF YEAR THAT VAIN WILL 
CONTINUE THROUGH THE NIGHT TONIGHT 
STAYING MILD BUT A LITTLE ON THE 
MISTY SIDE GENERALLY SPEAKING 
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF CLOUD AND IT 
WILL BE A QUIET NIGHT TO COME 
LOOKING AT THE SATELLITE PICTURE 
OVER THE LAST FEW HOURS IS A GOOD 
INDICATION OF WHAT IS TO COME THE 
CLOUD OVER LONDON HAS STARTED TO 
FILL IN AND THAT WILL CONTINUE 
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT SO THAT WILL 
ACT LIKE A BLANKET WITH A MILD 
NIGHT WRAPPING US UP NICELY A 
LITTLE DRIZZLE THROUGH 
BUCKINGHAMSHIRE AND HERTFORDSHIRE 
BY DAWN BUT IT WON'T BE A COLD 
START TO THE DAY SO IT WILL START 
OFF MISTY AND GREY BUT THE CLOUD 
WILL THIN AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE 
SUNNY SPELLS COMING THROUGH SO A 
PROMISING FRIDAY AND A PLEASANT SIXTEEN 
IS SIX FAHRENHEIT BUT WE WILL SEE 
CHANGES THROUGH THE WEEKEND THE 
CLOUD WILL GATHER OVERNIGHT ON 
FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY AND THERE IS A 
THREAT OF AN ARRIVING LATE ON 
SATURDAY BUT IT WILL NOT BE COLD 
RAIN TO COME THROUGH CENTRAL LONDON 
AND TO THE NORTH ON SATURDAY AND 
ONCE THAT RAIN CLEARS THROUGH A 
NORTHERLY WIND KICKS IN AND WE'LL 
SEE BELIEVE IT OR NOT WINTRY 
SHOWERS AND FEELING COLD ON SUNDAY 
NOW TO YOUR VIEWS ON THE OLYMPICS 
AFTER A POLL TODAY SUGGESTED THAT 
MORE THAN HALF OF LONDONERS COULD 
NOT SEE THE BENEFIT OF HOSTING THE 
GAMES SARAH THINKS IT IS A TOTAL 
WASTE OF MONEY AND MANY WHO HAVE 
HOSTED THE OLYMPICS ARE STILL 
PAYING FOR THE PLEASURE MANY YEARS 
LATER AND ALEX SAYS SHE HAS TWO 
YOUNG CHILDREN AND BELIEVES THE 
CITY WILL BENEFIT FROM THE GAMES 
NOT LEAST BECAUSE WE GET FIVE CHANCE 
TO WITNESS HISTORY AND GIVE 
CHILDREN A SPRINGBOARD IN WHICH TO 
GET INVOLVED IN SPORT IF THEY WISH 
GARY SAYS AT NO POINT WERE WE 
GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE 
AGAINST LONDON BEING THE VENUE AND 
JOHN SAYS PEOPLE WOULD BE MUCH 
MORE INTERESTED IF HOUSEHOLDS GOT 
FREE TICKETS TO PAY BACK THEIR 
CONTRIBUTION AND MARK SAYS IMPOSE 
WE HAD EXACTLY THE SAME TOPICS 
RAISED IN THE LEAD UP TO THE SIDLY 
OLYMPICS BUT IT WAS THE BEST THING 
THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IT RAISED 
TOURISM AND I DON'T SEE WHY IT 
WON'T HAPPEN FOR LONDON 
THEHOOD LINES EIGHT MEN WENT ON 
TRIAL IN LONDON TODAY ACCUSED OF 
PLOTTING TO TAKE EXPLOSIVES ON 
BOARD PLANES DISGUISED AS SOFT 
DRINKS ZIMBABWE'S PRESIDENT 
ROBERT MUGABE HAS APPEARED ON 
STATE TELEVISION AND INSISTED HE 
WILL FIGHT A SECOND ROUND IF HE HAS 
NOT WON THE STATE ELECTION SENIOR 
POLICE OFFICERS ARE URGING THE 
GOVERNMENT TO RECLASSIFY CANNABIS 
AS A CLASS B. DRUG THE GOVERNMENT 
IS RECONSIDERING THAT DECISION KEN 
LIVINGSTONE HAS TOLD THIS PROGRAMME 
THAT HE DOESN'T THINK NEW 
REVELLATIONS ABOUT HIS PRIVATE LIFE 
WILL AFFECT HIS MAYORAL CAMPAIGN 
AND A SURVEY SUGGESTS THAT MORE 
THAN HALF OF LONDONERS DON'T THINK 
THE OLYMPICS GAMES WILL BENEFIT 
THEM THAT'S IT FOR TONIGHT FROM 
ME AND ALL THE TEAM HERE A VERY 
GOOD EVENING TO YOU
