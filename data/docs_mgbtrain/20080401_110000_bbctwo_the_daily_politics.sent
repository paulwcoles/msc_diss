AFTERNOON FOLKS WELCOME TO THE 
DAILY POLITICS RECORD LEVELS OF 
IMMIGRATION ARE BRINGING LITTLE 
ECONOMIC BENEFIT THAT IS ACCORDING 
TO A POWERFUL PARLIAMENTARY REPORT 
PUBLISHED THIS MORNING WE WILL ASK 
THE MINISTER RESPONSIBLE IF IT IS 
NOT NOW TIME TO PUT A CAP ON THE 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMING TO BRITAIN 
LABOUR IS CONSIDERING GIVING FREE 
SCHOOL MEALS TO EVERY CHILD AS PART 
OF ITS NEXT ELECTION MANIFESTO 
WOULD THAT MAKE OUR KIDS LESS 
OBESE OBESE DOES GORDON BROWN HAVE A SENSE OF 
HUMOUR ON APRIL FOOLS' DAY WE ASK 
WHETHER BROWN COULD BE FOOLED AND 
ACTUALLY LAUGH ABOUT IT 
HOW DO WE TACKLE ISLAMIC EXTREMISM 
IN BRITAIN IS FUNDING PROJECTS TO 
ENGAGE YOUNG MUSLIMS ABOUT DOING 
SOMETHING OR JUST BEING SEEN TO DO 
SOMETHING SOMETHING THEY ARE GIVING US A BUNCH OF MONEY 
JUST TO SHOW FROM THEIR SIDE THAT 
THEY ARE DOING BUT THEY ARE NOT 
DOING SOMETHING THEY WANT TO SHOW 
PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF THAT THEY ARE 
DOING SOMETHING BUT IN TRUTH THEY 
ARE NOT DOING SOMETHING 
ALL THAT COMING UP WITH US FOR THE 
DURATION TODAY HUMERA KHAN A 
MUSLIM COMMUNITY ACTIVIST WELCOME 
TO THE DAILY POLITICS HELLO FIRST HELLO FIRST THE NEWS THAT THE LABOUR PARTY IS 
CONSIDERING I EMPHASISE 
CONSIDERING MAKING SCHOOL MEALS 
FREE TO ALL CHILDREN IN ITS NEXT 
ELECTION MANIFESTO IT'S AN IDEA 
THAT IS DOING THE ROUNDS IN 
WESTMINSTER YOU HAVE GOT SCHOOL 
AGE CHILDREN 
I DO 
WHY SHOULD THE 
GOVERNMENT PAY FOR EVERYBODY'S 
SCHOOL MEAL AS OPPOSED TO THE KIDS 
WHOSE PARENTS CAN'T AFFORD IT IT'S IT'S A STRANGE PROPOSAL COMING AT SUCH A 
TIME WHERE WE PAY FOR EVERYTHING 
FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN WE EXPECTED 
THINGS TO BE VERY CHEAP OR FREE IT 
WAS MORE THE NORM L. THINK WHY I 
WOULD SAY IT'S A GOOD IDEA WOULD BE 
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE HEALTHY 
CHILDREN IF IT'S BALANCED OUT WITH 
HAVING HEALTHY MENU IT IS A GOOD 
IDEA THE QUESTION I WOULD ASK 
WOULD BE WHERE'S THE MONEY GOING TO 
COME FROM WHAT DO WE LOSE 
IT HAS 
TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE YES THE YES THE KIDS WOULD HAVE MORE MONEY TO BUY 
RUBBISH THEY WON'T MAKE SCHOOL 
MEALS COMPULSORY 
THAT IS THE 
QUESTION THAT WE WOULD NEED TO KNOW 
ARE THEY GOING TO FORCE EVERYBODY 
TO HAVE IT OR IS THERE STILL THE 
OPTION OF 
A PACKED LUNCH L. KNOW AS A PARENT WHO HAS DONE BOTH SENT 
MONEY WITH MY KIDS AND PACKED 
LUNCHES THAT PACKED LUNCHES TO 
MAKE THEM INTERESTING IS VERY 
DIFFICULT PARTICULARLY IN WINTER 
YEAH 
YOU DON'T 
KNOW YOU DON'T YEAH KNOW WHAT THEY THROW AWAY 
DO YOUR 
CHILDREN SPEND THE MONEY ON THE 
SCHOOL LUNCHES 
WHEN THEY ARE 
YOUNGER THEY DO WHEN THEY GET 
OLDER THEY TELL A FEW WHITE LIES 
I CAN IMAGINE GOOD TO HAVE YOU 
TODAY TODAY TIME FOR OUR DAILY QUIZ THE 
QUESTION IS 
TO ENTER GO TO OUR WEBSITE 
AT THE END OF THE PROGRAMME HUMERA 
WILL GIVE US THE CORRECT ANSWER IF 
YOU WANT TO SEND US YOUR COMMENTS 
IT IS THE USUAL E. MAIL ADDRESS NOW RECORD LEVELS OF IMMIGRATION ITS POLICIES 
IT CALLS FOR CAP ON THE NUMBERS 
OF FOREIGNERS COMING TO THIS 
COUNTRY IN THE FUTURE THE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS ALREADY DOING 
A LOT OF WHAT THE STUDY RECOMMENDS 
AN INCE INFLUENCE SHALL REPORT 
PUBLISHED BY MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE 
OF LORDS SAID THAT AN INFLUENTIAL 
REPORT PUBLISHED BY MEMBERS OF THE 
HOUSE OF LORDS SAID THE REPORT 
SETS OUT THE WINNERS AND THE LOSERS 
IT INDICATES CERTAIN GROUPS WITHIN 
BRITAIN THE LOW PAID SOME ETHNIC 
MINORITIES AND SOME YOUNG PEOPLE 
WHO ARE ENTERING THE LABOUR MARKET 
THEY HAVE SUFFERED FROM COMPETITION 
FROM IMMIGRANTS THE WINNERS HAVE 
BEEN THE ECONOMIC MIGRANTS AND 
BRITISH BUSINESSES IN THE REPORT 
MINISTERS ARE URGED TO HAVE AN 
EXPLICIT TARGET RANGE FOR 
IMMIGRATION AND TO SET RULES TO 
KEEP WITHIN THAT LIMIT IT 
SUGGESTED THAT THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE 
TO FOLLOW RELATIVES WHO HAVE 
SETTLED IN THE U. K. COULD BE MODIFIED 
IF THE GOVERNMENT CHOSE TO DO SO 
AND IT REJECTS AS FUNDAMENTALLY 
FLAWED THE CLAIMS THAT HIGH LEVELS 
OF IMMIGRATION ARE NEEDED TO 
PREVENT LABOUR SHORTAGES THE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS IMMIGRANTS ARE 
BOOSTING THE ECONOMY BY SIX BILLION 
A YEAR THE COMMITTEE REJECTS THAT 
FIGURE AS A MISLEADING MEASURE IT 
SUGGESTS THAT INSTEAD IMMIGRATION 
SHOULD BE MEASURED PER CAPITA IN 
OTHER WORDS THE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON 
EVERY SINGLE INDIVIDUAL DOING THAT 
THE REPORT SAYS OUR GENERAL 
CONCLUSION IS THAT THE ECONOMIC 
BENEFITS OF POSITIVE NET 
IMMIGRATION ARE SMALL OR 
INSIGNIFICANT EARLIER I SPOKE TO 
THE REPORT'S AUTHOR LORD WAKEHAM 
I ASKED HIM WHY THE GOVERNMENT'S 
ESTIMATE OF A SIX BILLION BOOST TO 
THE ECONOMY WAS FLAWED 
WE SAY THAT 
THE WAY OF MEASURING IT SHOULD BE 
ON THE BASIS OF HOW MUCH PER CAPITA 
DOES THAT INCREASE REPRESENT PER PER HEAD OF POPULATION 
PER HEAD OF THE 
POPULATION THAT IS VIRTUALLY 
NOTHING PER HEAD OF THE POPULATION 
AND INDEED IN SOME OF THE LOWER 
PAID IT IS PROBABLY A NEGATIVE 
QUANTITY 
HOW DID YOU REACH THAT QUANTITY CONCLUSION 
BECAUSE OF THE CONCLUSION OVERWHELMING BULK OF EVIDENCE THAT 
WE GOT AND WE BELIEVE THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO REALISED THAT 
THEIR CLAIMS WERE NOT BASED ON VERY 
GOOD ECONOMICS EITHER THEY ARE ALL 
IN THE BUSINESS OF CHANGING THEIR 
MINDS IT IS THE OVERWHELMING 
CONSENSUS OF THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF 
EVIDENCE WE GOT 
IT IS A VERY 
COMPLICATED PROCESS ISN'T IT DO 
YOUR CALCULATIONS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT 
THE SERVICES THAT IMMIGRANTS USE AS 
WELL AND NET THAT OUT ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN MEASURE 
ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO SAY IN OUR 
REPORT IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
STATISTICS ARE NOT VERY GOOD AND WE 
A STRONG RECOMMENDATION THAT THE 
STANDARDS OF STATISTICS HAS TO BE 
IMPROVED THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK 
OF ENGLAND COULDN'T ESTIMATE THE 
LABOUR FORCE BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW 
WHAT THE NUMBERS WERE 
YOU ALSO 
TALK ABOUT A CAP ON IMMIGRATION 
BEING PREFERABLE TO THE NEW POINTS 
BASED SYSTEM 
NO LET ME GET YOU 
RIGHT IT IS THE GOVERNMENT THAT 
SAYS THAT THEIR SYSTEM IS BETTER 
THAN OURS AND THE ANSWER IS YOU 
CAN'T HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER 
IF YOU HAVE A TARGET AND YOU HAVE 
TO HAVE A TARGET YOU HAVE TO HAVE 
A SYSTEM TO DO THAT OUR VIEW IS 
THE POINTS BASED SYSTEM COULD BE 
THE BEST WAY OF DOING THAT BUT YOU 
CAN'T HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER 
WE ARE IN FAVOUR OF A POINTS BASED 
SYSTEM WE DON'T THINK THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS THOUGHT THAT THROUGH 
PROPERLY THEY NEED TO DO SOME MORE 
THINKING ABOUT IT YOU HAVE TO HAVE 
BOTH 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS RESPONDED BOTH TO SOME OF YOUR CONCERNS WITH THIS 
POINTS BASED SYSTEM BY RESTRICTING 
THE NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS BASED ON 
SKILL LEVELS 
WE ARE NOT AGAINST A 
POINTS BASED SYSTEM ALL WE ARE 
SAYING IS WE KNEW THIS BEFORE WE 
WROTE OUR REPORT WE SAY IT'S A 
PERFECTLY POSSIBLE WAY OF DOING IT 
BUT IT IS NOT DONE AND WELL 
THOUGHT THROUGH BY THE GOVERNMENT 
IT WILL BE SEEN THROUGH THE PRISM 
THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE IMMIGRANTS 
WHETHER OR NOT IT IS BASED ON 
ECONOMICS 
THE HEADLINES IN THE ECONOMICS NEWSPAPERS TODAY HAVEN'T MADE THAT 
VERY SIMPLE MISTAKE BECAUSE IT IS 
NOT TRUE IT'S 
TRUE WE 
HAVE HAD A MILLION AND A HALF 
IMMIGRANTS INTO THIS COUNTRY THEY 
ARE FORECAST TO COME IN AT ONE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND 
A YEAR WE ARE NOT SAYING THERE 
SHOULDN'T BE IMMIGRANTS INTO THIS 
COUNTRY THE NET IMMIGRATION 
BE MUCH NEARER INTO BALANCE THE 
LAST YEAR OR SO IT'S BEEN ROUGHLY 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND COMING IN AND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND GOING 
OUT THAT'S ROUGHLY THE FIGURES 
THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF IMMIGRANTS 
COMING IN UNDER ANY PROPOSALS THAT 
WE HAVE MADE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THAT WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE REPORT 
LORD WAKEHAM LIAM BYRNE IS HERE 
THE IMMIGRATION MINISTER IT WILL 
AND NO POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE 
LIVING STANDARDS OF THOSE OF US 
ALREADY HERE ON IMMIGRATION THE SIX 
BILLION THAT YOU USE ADDING TO OUR 
NATIONAL WEALTH IS SHAKY AND A BAD 
ARGUMENT ON G. D. P. PER CAPITA THAT 
IS OUR INCOME INDIVIDUALLY OF THOSE 
ALREADY IN THIS COUNTRY NO 
SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT FROM 
IMMIGRATION WHAT'S LEFT OF THE 
ECONOMIC CASE 
WELL I THINK THE 
COMMITTEE MAKES AN ECONOMIC CASE 
FOR MIGRATION LET'S BRING THIS 
BACK TO FIRST PRINCIPLES IF WE 
BANNED BUSINESSES IN THE U. K. FROM 
EMPLOYING PEOPLE 
NOBODY IS 
SUGGESTING THAT DON'T SET UP AUNT 
SALLYS THAT NO ONE IS SUGGESTING 
WHAT IS THE ECONOMIC CASE FOR 
IMMIGRATION 
I'M ABOUT TO FINISH IMMIGRATION THIS POINT IF YOU BANNED 
BUSINESSES IN THIS COUNTRY FROM 
EMPLOYING SKILLED WORKERS FROM 
ABROAD THAT WOULD BE BAD FOR 
SOCIETY AND IT WOULD BE BAD FOR THE 
ECONOMY SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS 
THE KIND OF MIGRATION THAT WE WANT 
IN THIS COUNTRY WHAT IS THE KIND 
OF MIX NOW WHERE I DISAGREE WITH 
THE COMMITTEE IS THAT I THINK SIX 
BILLION IS A PRIZE WORTH HAVING 
THAT IS GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY THEY THEY SAY IT IS SHAKY AND A BAD ARGUMENT 
YOU YOURSELF HAVE SAID THE G. D. P. 
FIGURES ARE NOT THE ONES THAT 
MATTER YOU TOLD THE COMMITTEE I 
PERSONALLY THINK THAT G. D. P. PER 
CAPITA OUR INCOME AS INDIVIDUALS 
IS THE KEY THING TO FOCUS ON AND 
THIS COMMITTEE CONCLUDES IT'S HAD 
NO SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT ON OUR 
INCOMES 
WHAT I SAID TO THE COMIET INCOMES TEE IS WE NEED TO LOOK AT A 
COMMITTEE IS WE NEED TO LOOK AT A 
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THINGS G. D. P. PER 
CAPITA SHOULD BE THE THING THAT WE 
FOCUS ON WHEN YOU LOOK AT G. D. P. PER 
CAPITA YOU ARE AUTOMATICALLY INTO 
THE 
BUSINESS OF AVERAGING THE 
IMPACT OF MIGRATION PER CAPITA IS 
GOING TO BE LOW BECAUSE EIGHTY EIGHT TO NINETY PER CENT OF 
THE WORKFORCE IS BRITISH OF COURSE 
THE IMPACT OF MIGRATION ON G. D. P. PER 
CAPITA IS GOING TO BE LOW BECAUSE 
FOREIGN WORKERS ARE A SMALL PART OF 
THE OVERALL WORKFORCE 
HOW CAN 
THERE BE MUCH BENEFIT TO EXISTING 
WORKERS IN THIS COUNTRY NO MATTER 
THEY COME FROM THOSE WHO ARE 
ALREADY HERE WHEN EIGHTY ONE PER CENT OF ALL NEW 
JOBS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN HAVE GONE TO 
IMMIGRANTS 
YOU ARE MIXING A IMMIGRANTS DIFFERENT ARGUMENT UP HERE BECAUSE 
NOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IS 
WHETHER THERE IS COME PESTIGS 
COMPETITION IN THE JOBS MARKET 
HERE IS WHERE THE POINTS SYSTEM 
WILL HELP 
I REALLY DO THINK THIS 
IS AN IMPORTANT POINT 
IT IS IF 
YOU LET ME ANSWER IT ANDREW I 
WILL 
YOU SEEM DETERMINED NOT TO WILL ANSWER A SINGLE QUESTION I'M ASKING 
YOU SO LET ME ASK YOU AGAIN 
NONSENSE 
LET ME ASK YOU AGAIN NONSENSE THESE ARE GOVERNMENT FIGURES HOW 
CAN THE LET ME ASK YOU AND YOU 
ANSWER IT AND I WON'T INTERRUPT YOU 
HOW CAN IT BE THE CASE THAT THERE 
CAN BE ANY REAL BENEFITS TO THOSE 
ALREADY LIVING IN THIS COUNTRY 
MANY OF WHOM HAVE COME AS 
IMMIGRANTS IN YEARS BEFORE HOW CAN 
IT BE OF BENEFIT WHEN EIGHTY ONE PER CENT OF ALL 
NEW JOBS IN THE PAST TEN YEARS HAVE 
GONE TO IMMIGRANTS 
BECAUSE JOBS 
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS HAVE GONE 
UP AND SO HAS THE PRODUCTIVITY OF 
THE ECONOMY THE REASON THAT THAT 
IS IMPORTANT IS THAT AN INCREASE IN 
PRODUCTIVITY TRANSLATES INTO AN 
INCREASE IN WAGES FOR NATIVE 
WORKERS THIRTY FOUR PER CENT PER YEAR OVER THE 
LAST TEN YEARS THAT IS A VERY RARE 
ACHIEVEMENT IN ANY ECONOMY WHY WHY HAVE MORE NEW JOBS NOT GONE TO 
PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY HERE THERE 
ARE LOTS OF UNEMPLOYED THERE ARE 
FIVE MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY 
OF WORKING AGE WHO DON'T WORK THEY 
LIVE ON BENEFITS WHY HAVE MORE OF 
THE NEW JOBS THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT 
CLAIMS CREDIT FOR WHY HAVE THEY 
NOT GONE TO PEOPLE ALREADY LIVING 
HERE 
EMPLOYERS HAVE MADE DECISIONS HERE ABOUT WHO IS BEST TO FILL 
PARTICULAR JOBS THE EMPLOYMENT 
RATE HAS GONE UP THIS IS WHERE THE 
DEBATE WILL TURN TO NOW 
HAS THE 
NUMBER OF BRITISH BORN PEOPLE IN 
JOBS GONE UP OR DOWN OVER THE PAST 
SEVEN YEARS 
THE EMPLOYMENT RATE 
HAS GONE UP 
I DIDN'T ASK THAT HAS 
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BRITISH BORN 
PEOPLE WHO I EMPHASISE IN THIS 
MULTI CULTURAL SOCIETY COME FROM 
ALL MANNER OF BACKGROUNDS NOW HAS 
THE NUMBER OF BRITISH BORN PEOPLE 
IN THE LABOUR FORCE GONE UP OR 
FALLEN AT A TIME WHEN OVER TWENTY FIVE 
MILLION NEW JOBS HAS BEEN CREATED 
IT'S GONE UP 
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M 
ASKING 
IT IS NOW THE THIRD ASKING HIGHEST 
NO NO THESE FIGURES HIGHEST ARE NONSENSE YOUR OWN FIGURES SHOW 
THAT AS THE NUMBER OF NEW JOBS HAS 
BEEN CREATED IN THIS COUNTRY THE 
NUMBER OF BRITISH BORN PEOPLE IN 
THE LABOUR FORCE HAS DECLINED 
THERE'S THE TABLE FROM YOUR OWN 
DEPARTMENT THERE YES THERE'S YES THERE'S THE TABLE WHY IS THAT WHY YOU YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE SHARE ISN'T IT 
YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE SHARE OF 
BRITISH WORKERS AS A SHARE OF THE 
TOTAL 
THESE ARE THE TOTAL FIGURES TOTAL I WILL TAKE MY FIGURES BACK 
WHICH EVER WAY YOU LOOK AT IT TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR MILLION BRITISH BORN PEOPLE 
THERE'S NOW FEWER BRITISH PEOPLE IN 
THE LABOUR FORCE TODAY THAN THERE 
WAS SEVEN YEARS AGO 
YOU CAN'T GET 
AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT THE 
EMPLOYMENT RATE FOR BRITISH PEOPLE 
HAS GONE UP AT THE SAME TIME AS 
WAGES HAVE GONE UP AT THE SAME 
TIME AS PRODUCTIVITY HAS GONE UP 
ONE MORE QUESTION ALL THIS 
EMPHASIS IS ON IMMIGRATION L. WANT 
TO ASK YOU ABOUT EMIGRATION COULD 
YOU EXPLAIN HOW UNDER A LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
LEAVING THIS COUNTRY EMIGRATION IS 
NOW HIGHER THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE 
THE IRISH POTATO FAMINE 
THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK 
AROUND THE WORLD BEFORE I CAME 
INTO POLITICS I SPENT A PERIOD 
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AT THE END OF THE DOTH 
COM ERA WE EMPLOYED PEOPLE FROM 
ALL OVER THE WORLD L. SPENT TIME 
WORKING ALL OVER THE WORLD BECAUSE 
THERE ARE NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK 
WHY DO MORE BRITISH PEOPLE FIFTEEN PER CENT OF 
SKILLED BRITISH WORKERS HAVE LEFT 
THIS COUNTRY IN THE PAST TEN YEARS 
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT BECAUSE BECAUSE THE WORLD ECONOMY HAS CHANGED OUT 
OF ALL RECOGNITION WE EQUIP PEOPLE 
WITH SKILLS TO COMPETE WITH THE 
BEST ALL OVER THE WORLD IF PEOPLE 
MAKE THEIR CAREERS ABROAD GOOD FOR 
THEM IF THAT IS HOW THEY WANT TO 
GET ON WITH LIFE L. MYSELF HAVE 
SPENT A LARGE PART OF MY CAREER 
WORKING IN THE FAR EAST THE UNITED 
STATES AND EUROPE 
THE PERCENTAGE 
OF BRITISH PEOPLE GOING ABROAD IS 
HIGHER 
THAT IS PART OF OUR HIGHER TRADITION 
ISN'T ONE OF THE TRADITION PROBLEMS WITH THIS MASSIVE INFLUX 
OF IMMIGRANTS IN RECENT YEARS 
MAINLY FROM EASTERN EUROPE SO IT 
IS NOT A RACIAL MATTER MOST OF 
THEM ARE WHITE IT IS MADE FOR 
DIFFICULT FOR THE SONS OF EXISTING 
IMMIGRANTS TO GET JOBS 
OUTSIDE THE 
ECONOMIC ARGUMENT OUR ECONOMY IS 
THAT YOU HAVE TO SORT OF COST INTO 
IT THE SORT OF SOCIAL COST OF IT L. 
THINK WHERE I LIVE WHERE WE HAVE A 
LARGE NUMBER OF NEW EAST EUROPEAN 
MIGRANTS IT IS PEOPLE ARE 
ACCEPTED AS NORMAL AND I I UNDERSTAND THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT 
RATE AMONG THIRD AND SECOND 
GENERATION IMMIGRANTS I HIGH FROM FROM MY EXPERIENCE PEOPLE DON'T THINK 
ABOUT IT IN THAT WAY PEOPLE ARE 
MORE WORRIED ABOUT EDUCATION AND 
ARE THEY BEING HAMPERED BY THE FACT 
THAT HALF OF THE CLASS NEEDS 
TRANSLATION THEY WORRY ABOUT 
HOUSING THE AVERAGE PERSON IS NOT 
ASKING THE ECONOMIC QUESTION THAT 
YOU PUTTING TO THE MINISTER WE WE WILL COME BACK TO THIS ISSUE WE 
ARE DONE WITH YOU MINISTER THANK 
YOU FOR JOINING US L. WILL SEND YOU 
THE FIGURES LATER 
WHAT IS THE MOST 
EFFECTIVE WAY OF TACKLING ISLAMIC 
EXTREMISM IN THE U. K. THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS BEEN POURING MONEY INTO 
COMMUNITY PROJECTS FOR YOUNG 
MUSLIMS IT IS TRYING TO EXTEND THE 
LENGTH OF TIME THAT TERROR SUSPECTS 
CAN BE DETAIN WITHOUT CHARGE WHAT 
IMPACT DO THE POLICIES HAVE ON 
RELATIONS WITH THE MUSLIM 
COMMUNITY WE ASK OUR GUEST HUMERA 
KHAN IN A MOMENT FIRST GILES 
DILNOT REPORTS 
IN LONDON THREE 
YOUNG BRITISH MUSLIMS ARE DISCUSS 
WHRAG THEY WILL PUT IN A 
DOCUMENTARY FILM ABOUT CITIZENSHIP 
THE REAL HOOD PROJECT WILL BE SHOWN 
TO M. P.'S AND IT IS PART OF AN ATTEMPT 
TO RECONNECT WITH THE COMMUNITY AND 
GENERATION FROM WHICH THOSE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR SEVEN SEVENTHS HAD COME 
IT IS 
A FILM ABOUT WHAT WE LIKE PUTTING 
IT FACE ON DOING IT POLITICALLY 
YOU SEEM TO BE TRYING TO COMBAT 
APATHY AS MUCH AS EXTREMISM I I WANT TO SHOW WE ARE YOUNG AND WE 
DO CARE IF YOU THINK THAT IS WHY 
WE ARE GETTING INVOLVED L. STILL 
CARE ABOUT 
THIS COUNTRY L. L. LOVE THIS COUNTRY AS MUCH AS BANGLADESH 
HOPEFULLY WE WILL HAVE A DIRECT 
AUDIENCE WITH M. P.'S WATCHING ITS AND 
THEY WILL GET AN IDEA OF HOW OUR 
VIEWS ARE 
THERE NEEDS TO BE THAT 
ENGAGEMENT WITH YOUNG PEOPLE AND 
FINDING OUT WHAT THEY WANTS WHAT 
WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS FIND OUT 
GIVE THEM THE FREEDOM TO FIND WHAT 
THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT 
ITS NOT 
ALWAYS ABOUT THE IRAQ WAR AND 
MISHIMS BEING NEGLECTED THEY ARE 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE WHOLE COMMUNITY 
NOT JUST ONE SPECIFIC COMMUNITY 
THE PROJECT THE STUDENTS TO EIGHT 
WEEKENDS OF WORK THEY ARE ONLY 
JUST GETTING TO GRIPS WITH THE 
CAMERAS WE THOUGHT WE WOULD GET 
THEM DOING THE WORK ONE TOPY THEY 
INTERESTED IN IS THE THE STOP AND 
SEARCH POWERS OF THE POLICE 
IF YOU 
DO THINGS TO SOMEONE SUSPICIOUS 
STOP THEM BUT IF THEY ARE IN THE 
PARK THAT IS NOT A REASON UNLESS 
YOU SEE THERE IS PROOF TO ACTUALLY 
SEARCH THEM 
WE ARE YOUNG AND WE DO 
DUMB THINGS EVERYONE HAS BEEN 
THROUGH THAT F. YOU TARGET SOMEBODY 
IT CAUSES PROBLEMS IT GETS INTO 
PEOPLE'S MINDS F. YOU ARE TRYING TO 
DO THINGS FOR THE PEOPLE IF THE 
PEOPLE THINK BAD OF YOU IT IS NO 
GOOD 
DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT GOOD IS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME ON 
MUSLIMS AND ISSUES SHOULD THEY 
CONCENTRATE ON ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR DIFFERENT I I THINK THAT THEY NEED TO CONSTEN 
TRAIT A BITS ON IT CONCENTRATE 
A BIT ON IT 
CAN YOU EXPLAIN MORE 
IT IS AN ISSUE WITH FUNDAMENTALISM 
AND THE TERRORISM PROBLEM THEY 
NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE 
THAT PEOPLE FEEL INTEGRATED MANY 
SOCIETY GIVEN THE JULY BOMBERS 
WERE BROUGHT UP IN THE U. K. THIS THIS WHOLE DEBATE NATIONAL DEBATE ABOUT 
INTEGRATION AND IMMIGRANTS 
INTEGRATING INTO SOCIETY IT IS 
IMPORTANT IT IS A HEALTHY DEBATE 
IT IS MARRED BY PEOPLE WHO THINK 
THAT EVERYTHING ABOUT MUSLIM IS BAD 
IT GETS ME ANNOYED WHEN MOST OF US 
HERE WE TAKE WHAT PART OF THE 
CULTURE IS GOOD AND WE ACCEPT IT 
AND WE ACCEPT IT INTO OUR LIFE THE THE FILM THESE GUYS ARE MAKING WILL BE 
SHOWN TO M. P.'S THE QUESTION THAT M. P.'S 
HAVE TO ASK THEMSELVES IS BY GIVING 
GROUPS LIKE THIS MONEY ARE YOU 
COMBATING RALKADSISATION IF NOT 
SHOULD YOU GIVE IT TO OTHER GROUPS 
RADICALISATION YOU RISK 
ALIENATESING OTHER MEMBERS OF 
SOCIETY HUMERA KHAN ANYTHING THE 
GOVERNMENT IS DOING IS IT HAVING 
ANY REAL IMPACT ON THE GROUND I I THINK THEY THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF 
NEGATIVE MEDIA ABOUT THE MONEY 
GOING TO GROUPS TO DO PROJECTS ON 
THE GROUND BUT I THINK THE 
MISUNDERSTANDING IS IT IS NOT 
POSSIBLE FOR VOLUNTARY SECTOR TO 
TACKLE THE EXTREME ISSUES TO DO 
WITH SECURITY OUR ROLE WE THINK 
THAT WE PLAY IS INTO CREATING 
PROVIDING AN UNDERPINNING OF BEING 
PREVENTATIVE OF DEVELOPING WORK 
WHICH HAS NOT BEEN HAPPENING FOR 
THE LAST SEVERAL DECADESS IT IS TO 
BUILD UP ON THAT AND TO AVOIDS 
YOUNG MUSLIMS BECOMING SUSSEPTSIBLE 
TO ANGRY RHETORIC AND TO 
RADICALISATION 
ONE WAY THEY CAN BE RADICALISATION SUSCEPTIBLE IS IF THEY HAVE NOTHING 
TO DO IF THEY ARE UNEMPLOYED THE 
BOMBERS IN JULY WERE ALL ON THE 
WELFARE STATE SOME WERE WELL 
ENGLAND KATEED THEY DID NOT WORK 
BUT DID NOTHING WELL EDUCATED 
SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO GIVE 
YOUNG PEOPLE SOME PURPOSE IN LIFE 
BEYOND LISTENING TO EXTREMISTS 
THAT IS THE POINT IS THAT THIS 
ISSUE DID NOT START AT NINE ELEVEN 
STARTED WITH PEOPLE FELT THEIR 
ISSUES WERE NOT BEING LISTENED TO 
THE RUSHDIE AFFAIR HIGHLIGHTED THE 
FEELING OF ALIENATION IT WAS NOT 
TACKLED 
IF HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS TACKLED OF THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE CAN 
COME TO THIS COUNTRY IN RECENT 
YEARS AND GET JOBS AND WORK HARD 
AND GET ON WHY CAN THOSE WHO ARE 
ALREADY HERE WHO WERE BORN HERE 
AND ARE BRITISH WHY DON'T THEY GET 
JOBS 
YOUNG MUSLIMS ARE THE SAME AS JOBS OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE IN BRITAIN THEY 
SUFFER A NUMBER OF FACTORS IN 
AREAS THEY HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF 
UNEMPLOYMENT THEY MAY SUFFER 
RACISM AND MORE RECEPBLTSLY WE 
TALK ABOUT ISLAMOPHOBIA WE HAVE TO 
LOOK A T. THE BARRIERS TO BEING 
YOUNG FEELING INTEGRATED AND BEING 
ABLE TO GET THE EMPLOYMENT WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT MANY REPORTS HAVE 
HIGHLIGHTED THESE THINGS WE HAVE A 
LOT OF REPORTS BUT WHAT WE ARE NOT 
SEEING IS ACTION ON THE GROUND TO 
HELP TO INTEGRATE YOUNG MUSLIMS 
INTO THE SYSTEM THERE ARE SOME 
INITIATIVES SOME THINGS HAPPENING 
WE WILL SEE THE FRUITS OF A LOT OF 
THE WORK HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE 
IT WON'T BE IMMEDIATELY YOU CAN'T 
IT IS NOT AN INSTANT THING SOME SOME MUSLIM LEADERS SAY IF THE 
GOVERNMENT EXTENDS THE AMOUNT OF 
TIME YOU CAN BE HELD WITHOUT TRIAL 
THE GOVERNMENTS WANTS FORTY TWO DAYS BUT 
THAT WILL ALIENATE YOUNG MUSLIMS 
MORE BUT THE FACT IS PEOPLE ARE 
NOT BEING PICKED OFF THE STREETS 
AND KEPT FOR FORTY TWO DAYS WITHOUT TRIAL 
ITS AFFECTS A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE IT IT IS HAPPENING TO MORE PEOPLE THAN WE 
HEAR ABOUT L. HAVE HEARD RECENTLY 
I WAS AT MEETINGS WHERE ORDINARY 
PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT SOMEBODY 
CAME TO THEIR HOUSE AND DID NOT SAY 
ANYTHING JUST TOOK SOMEBODY OFF 
THERE IS THIS FEELING OF INSECURITY 
AMONG PEOPLE THAT OKAY IT IS BAD 
ENOUGH TWENTY EIGHT DAYS BUT FORTY TWO DAYS WE 
HAVE NO RECOURSE AND PEOPLE'S LIVES 
ARE DESTROYED 
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE BEEN HELD FOR TWENTY EIGHT DAYS IS 
VERY SMALL 
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN TAKEN IN 
SOME OF THIS COULD 
BE URBAN MYTH BEING SPREAD BY 
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THIS 
COUNTRY'S INTERESTS AT HEART WHERE WHERE I LIVE PARTICULARLY AFTER NINE ELEVEN IT 
WAS HAPPENING A LOT THESE ARE 
FACTS THAT MUSLIM FAMILIES RA 
HAVING THEIR HOMES BROKEN INTO 
WELL NOT BROKEN INTO BUT THE 
POLICE TAKING OFF PEOPLE THAT IS 
WHAT THEY ARE AFRAID AFTER THANK THANK YOU FOR THAT YOUR E. MAILS ELEANOR 
SAYS I WORK IN IT AND I HAVE BEEN 
OUT OF WORK FOR THREE MONTHSS IN 
NINETEEN NINETY FIVE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED WORK PERMITS OR THE 
ISSUED TO NONE E. U. PEOPLE TO WORK IN 
THE U. K. PETER SAYS IF THE 
GOVERNMENT EMING KAITSED THE 
WORKFORCE THERE WOULD BE NO NEED 
FOR IMMIGRANTS NIGEL SAYS A LOT OF 
LOW SKILLED LABOUR IS MOPPING UP 
JOBS THAT COULD BE DONE BY THE 
INDIGENOUS WORKFORCE THANK YOU FOR 
THOSE NOW WERE YOU WONDERING 
WHETHER WE WOULD PLAY AN APRIL FOOL 
TODAY WELL TECHNICALLY IT IS TOO 
LATE THEY ARE NOT VALID AFTER 
MIDDAY BUT WE DID CHECK IF ANYONE 
IN DOWNING STREET PLAYED ONE OR 
GORDON BROWN WOULD HE FIND IT 
FUNNY IF THEY DID WHAT IS HIS 
SENSE OF HUMOUR HERE ARE HIS 
ATTEMPTS AND JOKES AND HOW HE 
RECEIVES THEM 
GORDON NOT ONLY SIX OFTEN THE 
CHANCELLOR GETS SOMETHING 
WELL AT 
LEAST I DON'T HAVE O' WORRY ABOUT 
HER RUNNING OFF WITH THE BLOKE NEXT 
DOOR 
WITH US NOW IS JOHN COLL SHAW DOES 
HE HAVE SENSE OF HUMOUR 
IT IS 
NOT THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO 
MIND BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A SMILE 
THERE IN HUMOROUS SITUATIONS IT 
MIGHT BE A SLIGHTLY AWKWARD ONE 
BUT A SMILE NONETHELESS YOU COULD 
GO ALONG WITH A JOKE AS MUCH AS 
ANYBODY BUT HE WOULD BE MINDSFUL 
THAT WE MUST BE VIGILANT IN THE 
FACE OF APRIL FOOLS JOKES LIKE 
SPEG ETCY IN TREES SPAGHETTI 
IN TREES 
POLITICIANS ARE NOT 
COMEDIANS 
WELL NO SUPPOSE THAT COMEDIANS IS TRUE IN MANY CASES L. L. SUPPOSE 
BECAUSE HE IS KNOWN FOR THIS KIND 
OF LANGUAGE WE WILL GET ON WITH 
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT 
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE HERE TO DO 
BECAUSE WE ARE SO USED TO SEEING 
THAT PEOPLE IMAGINE WHERE IS THE 
LIGHTER SIDE AND WHAT IS THAT LIKE 
THAT WAS SOMETHING TONY BLAIR WAS 
GOOD AT COMBINING THE LIGHT WITH 
THE SHADE 
YES L. THINK HE WAS 
ALWAYS MINDSFUL TO YOU KNOW BE 
APPROACHABLE AND THAT INFORMALITY 
IT IS INTERESTING WATCHING TONY 
BLAIR NOW IT IS LIKE THE WEIGHT OF 
THE WORLD HAS BEEN LIFTED OFF OF 
HIS SHOULDER THERE IS A DIFFERENT 
PERSONALITY EMERGING A BIT MORE 
CHEEKY AND YOU KNOW 
I'M GLAD YOU 
HAVE TO OPPORTUNITY TO RESREBGTS 
THE IMPRESSION BUT WE HAVE GOT TO 
LEAVE IT 
THOUGHT THE NICK CLEGG 
STORY THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS LO 
THAT ARE OWE WITH HIS THIRTY LOVERS LOTH AND OWE L. NOW THANK YOU TO 
OUR GERSS WE ARE BACK AT ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY
