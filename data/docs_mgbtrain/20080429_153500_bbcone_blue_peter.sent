IT'S FINALLY TIME TO THINK ABOUT SUMMER AND SUMMER SPORTS 
BUT NOT FOR GETHIN HE'S BEEN IN FINLAND GETTING SPORTY IN THE SNOW 
EVEN IN THE FREEZING COLD THERE'S PLENTY OF SPORT GOING ON 
FROM SKIING TO SNOWBOARDING ICE SKATING TO ICE HOCKEY 
BUT I'M NOT HERE FOR THOSE I'M HERE FOR ARCTIC RUGBY 
I'M IN FINLAND FOR THE MOST NORTHERLY RUGBY TOURNAMENT IN THE WORLD 
WITH TEMPERATURES OF MINUS TEN DEGREES CELSIUS THIS IS THE FIRST TIME 
I'VE PLAYED RUGBY ON A PITCH COVERED WITH SNOW 
THIS IS A RUGBY SEVENS TOURNAMENT WHICH IS BASED ON RUGBY UNION RULES 
BUT WITH A FEW DIFFERENCES INSTEAD OF FIFTEEN PLAYERS ONLY SEVEN 
TAKE TO THE FIELD 
JUST LIKE THE FIFTEEN MAN GAME IT'S FIVE POINTS TO SCORE A TRY 
WHICH IS WHEN THE BALL IS PLACED OVER THE OPPOSITION'S TRY LINE 
AFTER SCORING A TRY 
YOU EARN TWO MORE POINTS BY KICKING THE BALL BETWEEN THE POSTS 
BUT IN SEVENS YOU ATTEMPT A DROP KICK OR A DROP GOAL 
YES 
TIME TO MEET MY TEAM THE WARRIORS FROM HELSINKI FINLAND'S CAPITAL 
HI GUYS HELLO 
THIS IS THE CAPTAIN NICE TO MEET YOU THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME PLAY 
WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE FOR ME PLAYING ON THE SNOW TACKLE HARD 
IT'S SO MUCH FUN TACKLING ON THE SNOW 
BEFORE WE PLAY WE HAVE TO PAY TRIBUTE TO THE FINNISH SNOW GODS 
O. K. O. K. OH NO THERE'S ALWAYS AN INITIATION IN RUGBY 
O. K. YOU HAVE TO TAKE SNOW LIKE THIS 
AND GO LUMI LUMI LUMI LUMI LUMI LUMI LUMI 
AS IF YOU HAVE BIRDS IN YOUR HANDS 
ARE YOU WINDING ME UP 
LUMI LUMI LUMI LUMI LUMI 
THIS IS A JOKE RIGHT NO NO 
LUMI LUMI LUMI LUMI LUMI WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
SNOW LUMI SNOW MAKES SENSE 
O. K. 
YEAH 
I'D BEEN HAD WHAT A CHILLY WAY TO BE WELCOMED TO THE TEAM 
LET'S JUST HOPE YOUR RUGBY SKILLS ARE BETTER THAN YOUR JOKES 
BUT ENOUGH OF ALL OF THAT THERE WAS A COMPETITION TO GET STARTED 
WE WERE PLAYING IN THE FIRST GAME OF THE TOURNAMENT 
AGAINST A TEAM FROM ENGLAND CALLED KINGSCLERE 
I WAS LOVING IT PLAYING IN THE ARCTIC SNOW REALLY SAPPED MY ENERGY 
BUT AT LEAST WHEN I FELL IT SOFTENED THE BLOW 
ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A LONG WAY TO GO TILL THE FINAL 
EVERYONE WAS PLAYING HARD 
MY RUGBY COACH USED TO SAY GO IN HARD AND YOU WON'T GET HURT 
WELL DONE LADS HALF TIME 
TWELVE TO ZERO UP I'VE BEEN RUNNING ROUND LIKE A MADMAN 
IT'S GREAT FUN REALLY HARD HITS LET'S HOPE WE CAN KEEP IT GOING 
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID 
AS I CROSSED OVER FOR MY FIRST TRY IN THE SNOW COME ON 
BUT COULD I CONVERT MY OWN TRY 
YES ANOTHER TWO POINTS FOR THE WARRIORS' 
THE FIRST GAME WAS OVER AND WE CAME OUT ON TOP BY NINETEEN TO FIVE 
BUT THE FINAL WAS STILL A LONG WAY OFF 
EACH TEAM WILL PLAY FIVE GAMES AND THOSE WHO WON THE MOST 
WOULD GO HEAD TO HEAD IN THE FINAL 
IT WAS SOON TIME FOR US TO PLAY AGAIN' 
I'M STARTING THIS GAME ON THE SIDELINES 
I SPENT THE START OF GAME TWO AS A SUB 
WAITING FOR MY TURN ON THE PITCH 
BUT I QUICKLY REALISED THAT WASN'T WHERE I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 
HUH 
COULD YOU COME ON THE FIELD 
THE TEAM WAS ONE MAN SHORT 
I SHOULD'VE BEEN ON THE PITCH AFTER ALL 
A BIT EMBARRASSING BUT I HOPE I MADE UP FOR IT WHEN I SCORED 
WITH TWO MORE TRIES WE RACED THROUGH TO WIN THE MATCH 
WE FINISHED THE FIRST DAY HAVING WON ALL OF OUR GAMES 
AFTER OUR ACTION IN THE SNOW IT WAS TIME TO WARM UP AND RELAX 
IN A TRADITIONAL FINNISH SAUNA 
SAUNA'S ARE REALLY POPULAR HERE IN FINLAND PEOPLE USE THEM ALL THE TIME 
WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY IT'S HOT I THINK YOU'RE STEAMING UP 
THE HEAT IS REALLY GOOD TO HELP THE BODY RELAX AND SWEATING ALL THE TIME 
HELPS GET RID OF THE BAD STUFF THE IMPURITIES FROM YOUR SKIN 
I THINK I'VE HAD ENOUGH IN HERE 
THERE'S ONE FINNISH TRADITION I'M NOT SURE ABOUT AND THAT'S THIS PART 
YEAH COME ON 
OH MY GOODNESS 
OOH 
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE LET ME BACK IN THAT SAUNA NOW OOH THAT'S COLD 
COMING UP WITH THREE GAMES LEFT TO PLAY 
EVERYTHING WAS AT STAKE 
WILL WE KEEP ON WINNING AND GET THE TROPHY IT'S A MUST WIN MATCH 
OR WERE WE GOING TO BE LEFT OUT IN THE C. OLD 
OOH I CAN'T WAIT IT LOOKS SO COLD 
THERE'S SOME PRETTY TOUGH PLAYERS THERE 
FIND OUT LATER IF GETHIN'S TEAM WILL MAKE IT TO THE FINAL 
NOW TODAY ANDY IS PUTTING HIS ROPE SKILLS TO THE TEST 
AS HE ATTEMPTS TO LASSO HE'S BEING TAUGHT SOME MOVES RIGHT NOW 
BUT WHERE DOES LASSOING COME FROM LET'S FIND OUT 
GOT CATTLE TO CATCH THEN YOU NEED SOME NIFTY LASSO SKILLS 
THE TRUST OF AMERICAN COWBOYS 
LASSOS ARE USED ON RANCHES AND RODEO COMPETITIONS TO CATCH LIVESTOCK 
A LASSO IS A LOOP OF ROPE DESIGNED 
TO BE THROWN AROUND A TARGET AND TIGHTENED WHEN PULLED 
THE LASSO HAS A SMALL REINFORCED LOOP CALLED A HONDA 
THROUGH WHICH THE ROPE PASSES TO FORM A NOOSE CALLED THE LOOP 
THE LASSO IS HELD BY A STRETCH OF ROPE CALLED THE SPOKE 
WHICH IS KNOTTED AT THE END ROPE SPINNING IS THE PERFORMANCE 
OF DIFFERENT SPINNING TRICKS AND IS JUST FOR FUN 
OH PETE MATE THIS IS A LOT HARDER THAN IT LOOKS YESTERDAY 
YOU PUT ME THROUGH MY PACES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT 
HOW GOOD MY COORDINATION WAS ON THE ROPE HOW DID I DO BE HONEST 
AT THE BEGINNING YOU WEREN'T THAT GOOD 
IT SHOWS YOU'VE GOT TO PRACTISE AND PRACTISE YOU'LL GET THERE 
ADAM YOU'VE BEEN TEACHING ME THE WEDDING RING I'LL GIVE IT A GO NOW 
LET'S SEE IF I'VE FINALLY GOT IT SO I'LL HOLD IT THERE 
RIGHT HERE WE GO READY THREE TWO ONE 
OH THAT'S CLOSE GIVE IT A YEE HA DO YOU KNOW WHAT 
I'LL BE HONEST EVERY TIME I DO IT 
I KEEP GETTING IT TANGLED UP IN MY HANDS WHAT AM I DOING WRONG 
YOU NEED TO BRING YOUR HAND STRAIGHT ABOVE YOUR HEAD IMMEDIATELY 
OR IT'LL GET TANGLED LIKE THAT 
O. K. O. K. THAT'S QUITE GOOD BEFORE I FORGET 
LASSO ROPES CAN BE DANGEROUS SO IF YOU'RE THINKING OF HAVING A GO 
IF I DO GET THAT RIGHT WHICH I RECKON I PROBABLY WOULD 
HOW CAN I IMPROVE IT YOU FLIP IT UP AND DOWN YOUR BODY 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK OOH DO YOU KNOW WHAT ADAM THAT'S INTERESTING 
WELL I GUESS I JUST HAVE TO KEEP PRACTISING THEN 
YEAH KEEP PRACTISING BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER MOVE TO LEARN 
BEFORE YOU DO YOUR BIG ROUTINE AT THE END 
NO PRESSURE JUST KEEP SPINNING THAT ROPE 
NOW ANDY AND GETHIN RECENTLY TOOK A TRIP TO CHINA AND THEY'VE GOT 
SOME COOL EXCITING ADVENTURES THEY CANNOT WAIT TO SHARE WITH YOU 
HERE'S A LITTLE TASTE OF WHAT'S TO COME

SHE'S MOVING VERY SLOWLY IS THAT THE PACE SHE GENERALLY GOES AT

OR THERE'S ANOTHER ANIMAL AROUND BUT THEY'RE SLOW IN ALL THEY DO

BUT UNTIL THEN EARLIER ON WE SAW HOW GETHIN GOT ON AS HE HIT THE SNOW 
AND TOOK PART IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ARCTIC RUGBY TOURNAMENT IN FINLAND 
BUT DID HE MAKE IT TO THE FINAL THAT IS THE QUESTION TIME TO SEE 
THE ARCTIC RUGBY TOURNAMENT WAS HEADING INTO ITS FINAL STAGES 
MY TEAM THE WARRIORS HAD WON EVERY GAME WE PLAYED 
BUT OUR PLACE IN THE FINAL WAS FAR FROM SECURE 
WARRIORS 
WE WERE IN THE LEAD AGAINST THE SHARKS 
A TEAM OF PLAYERS FROM SOUTH AFRICA AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND 
THE FREEZING TEMPERATURES MADE IT EXTRA HARD 
BUT BOTH TEAMS WERE DETERMINED TO WIN 
WHEN THE FINAL WHISTLE WAS BLOWN OUR TEAMWORK HAD PAID OFF 
WITH A CONVINCING TWENTY SEVEN POINTS TO FIVE VICTORY 
WE'D DONE IT BEATING THE SHARKS HAD PUT US IN THE FINAL 
TOURNAMENT RULES MEANT THAT WE HAD ONE MORE GAME TO PLAY 
WE WANTED TO WIN IT TO GEAR US UP FOR THE FINAL 
BUT WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN REALLY KNOCKED OUR CONFIDENCE 
WE WERE PLAYING THE GINGERMEN FROM IRELAND 
WHO TOOK THE LEAD STRAIGHT AWAY 
THEY WERE JUST TOO STRONG AND WE WERE WELL BEATEN THEN CAME WORSE NEWS 
WE WERE TO FACE THEM AGAIN IN THE FINAL 
TWO TRIBES BY FRANKIE GOES TO HOLLYWOOD 
WE'D DONE SO WELL TO GET TO THIS POINT 
BUT WE WERE PLAYING AGAINST THE ONLY TEAM TO BEAT US SO FAR 
THERE WAS EVERY CHANCE THEY'D DO IT AGAIN 
THE GAME STARTED AT A FURIOUS PACE 
IT WAS OBVIOUS FROM THE START THIS WAS GONNA BE A BRUISING ENCOUNTER 
BUT WE WEREN'T GONNA GIVE UP WITHOUT A FIGHT 
BUT THE GINGERMEN DIDN'T WANNA GO HOME WITHOUT THE TROPHY 
I MANAGED TO GET THE FIRST TRY AND CONVERT IT WHICH GAVE US CONFIDENCE 
THE SECOND TRY SET US UP NICELY 
HALF TIME WE'RE TWELVE TO ZERO UP 
MANAGED TO GET TWO TRIES THANKS TO GREAT TEAM WORK 
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY THE TOUGHEST GAME OF THE TOURNAMENT SO FAR 
TIME FOR A TEAM TALK 
LOOK WHERE YOUR PLAYERS ARE MUCH BETTER BOYS MUCH BETTER 
BEST SEVEN MINUTES WE'VE PLAYED IN THIS TOURNAMENT YES 
WARRIORS 
THE SECOND HALF STARTED AS FAST AS THE FIRST 
BOTH SIDES ATTACKING WITH PACE AND PUTTING THEIR BODIES ON THE LINE 
THIS WAS THE LAST GAME OF THE TO LRNAMENT 
AND I WAS DETERMINED TO PUT EVERYTHING I HAD INTO IT 
TIRED BODIES 
LUNGS BURSTING IT COULD GO EITHER WAY 
IT WAS CLOSE RIGHT UP TO THE END 
I MANAGED TO GET THE BALL IN OPEN PLAY 
A SIDE STEP AND A BIT OF LUCK SET US UP NICELY INTO THE POSTS 
TRY WARRIORS 
WE'D DONE IT A FANTASTIC TEAM PERFORMANCE 
AND A WIN FOR THE WARRIORS 
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE SCORE WE LOST THEM EARLIER 
BUT BEAT THEM WHEN IT MATTERED GREAT TEAM WORK 
ARCTIC RUGBY IT WAS HARD IT WAS FAST
