EACH SUMMER PIRATES DESCENDED HERE 
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR CHILDREN 
BOYS WERE SOLD AS SLAVES 
GIRLS AS MAIDSERVANTS OR WORSE 
OFTEN BY THEIR OWN FAMILIES 
WULFSTAN BISHOP OF WORCESTER 
WAS ONE OF THE FEW TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THIS TRADE IN HUMAN SOULS 
YOU WOULD HAVE GROANED TO SEE THE FILES OF WRETCHES BEING PUT UP FOR SALE 
AN ACCURSED DEED THAT MEN SHOULD CONDEMN TO SLAVERY THEIR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD 
IN THE MODERN WORLD WE ACCEPT 
AT LEAST IN PRINCIPLE THAT WE'RE ALL EQUAL 
SOME PEOPLE MAY BE RICHER OR HAVE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES 
BUT NONETHELESS EQUALITY IS OUR IDEAL 
IN THE MEDIEVAL WORLD THAT WASN'T THE VIEW AT ALL 
YOU WERE BORN AND LIVED AND DIED IN RADICAL INEQUALITY 
WHATEVER POSITION IN LIFE YOU WERE BORN TO BARON OR KNIGHT 
PEASANT OR SLAVE THAT WAS WHERE YOU BELONGED 
FOR CENTURIES THIS HARSH SYSTEM GOVERNED THE MEDIEVAL WORLD 
BUT A LONG REVOLUTION WOULD TRANSFORM RELATIONS BETWEEN THOSE WITH POWER AND THOSE WITH NONE 
LIFE IN THE EARLY ELEVENTH CENTURY WAS ALMOST UNIMAGINABLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR OWN 
INEQUALITY AND OPPRESSION WERE PART OF THE NATURAL ORDER 
ORDAINED BY GOD 
THIS WAS A CLASS SYSTEM OF STAGGERING EXTREMES 
AND EVERY CLASS HAD AN EXACT PRICE 
JUST LIKE AN ANIMAL A HUMAN LIFE COULD BE MEASURED IN POUNDS SHILLINGS AND PENCE 
IF A PERSON WAS MURDERED THE VICTIM'S FAMILY COULD PURSUE 
THE KILLER FOR COMPENSATION KNOWN AS WERGILD 
LITERALLY MAN PRICE 
THAT PRICE DEPENDED ON THE VICTIM'S STATUS 
IT WAS PAID IN SHILLINGS 
FIVE SHILLINGS WAS THE COST OF A COW 
IF YOU KILLED A MERE PEASANT YOU PAID TWO HUNDRED SHILLINGS 
THE PRICE OF AROUND FORTY COWS 
IF YOU KILLED A NOBLEMAN YOU PAID A HEFTY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SHILLINGS 
A NOBLE'S LIFE WAS WORTH SIX TIMES A PEASANT'S 
THE VALUE OF YOUR LIFE WAS DETERMINED BY THE CLASS INTO WHICH YOU WERE BORN 
MEDIEVAL WRITERS DIVIDED SOCIETY INTO THREE FIXED CLASSES OR ORDERS 
THERE WERE THOSE WHO PRAY 
THE MONKS AND PRIESTS ABOUT FIVE PER CENT OF THE POPULATION 
THOSE WHO FIGHT ANOTHER FIVE PER CENT THE NOBLES AND KNIGHTS 
AND THEN ALL THE REST 
THE THIRD ORDER THOSE WHO WORK 
A HUGE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MIDDLE AGES 
TOILED AS SERFS ON THE ESTATES OF THE WEALTHY LANDOWNERS 
THIS WAS A RIGID WORLD IN WHICH YOUR CLASS WAS AS MUCH A PART OF YOU 
AS THE COLOUR OF YOUR SKIN 
IF YOU WERE BORN A PEASANT YOU STAYED A PEASANT 
AND THE LEGACY OF THIS EARLY APARTHEID SURVIVES EVEN IN THE LANGUAGE WE USE TODAY 
THE WORD GENTLEMAN COMES FROM THE SAME LATIN ROOT AS OUR MODERN WORD GENE 
IT MEANS LITERALLY SOMEONE WHO IS WELL BORN 
YOUR CLASS WAS LITERALLY IN YOUR GENES 
THOSE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCALE WERE BORN TO A LIFE OF HARDSHIP 
SERFS HAD TO WORK ON THEIR LORD'S LAND 
THEY ALSO SCRATCHED A LIVING FROM THE SMALL PLOTS HE GRANTED THEM 
THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY POET WILLIAM LANGLAND DESCRIBED THE LOT OF PEASANT WOMEN 
THEY SUFFER MUCH HUNGER AND WAKE AT MIDNIGHT TO CARD AND TO COMB 
TO RUB AND TO REEL 
THE WOE OF THESE WOMEN WHO DWELL IN HOVELS 
IS TOO SAD TO SPEAK OF OR TO SAY IN RHYME 
THE PEASANT CLASS WERE REGARDED AS A SORT OF WORKING BREEDING STOCK 
A SERF COULDN'T GET MARRIED WITHOUT HIS LORD'S PERMISSION 
AND NOR COULD HE LEAVE HE BELONGED TO THE LORD'S ESTATE 
IN LEGAL TERMS HE WAS TIED TO THE SOIL 
THE LAW EVEN STATED EARLS AND BARONS MAY SELL THEIR SERFS LIKE OXEN OR CATTLE 
AND IF YOU TRIED TO ESCAPE FROM YOUR LORD'S ESTATE YOU WERE PUNISHED 
MEDIEVAL LORDS WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS 
TO RECAPTURE THEIR RUNAWAY SERFS WITH THE FULL BACKING OF THE KING 
WHO ORDERED HIS OFFICIALS TO ARREST THEM AND RETURN THEM 
AND LORDS CLAIMED THE RIGHT TO PUT THEIR SERFS IN STOCKS 
STOCKS HAVE A RATHER COMICAL REPUTATION NOWADAYS 
BUT THE REALITY WAS VERY DIFFERENT 
THEY WERE A HUMILIATING AND PAINFUL PUNISHMENT 
IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO BE IN HERE FOR TWO HOURS 
THE CRAMP AND DISCOMFORT 
WHERE FOR EXAMPLE DID YOU RELIEVE YOURSELF 
AND WHAT IF YOU WERE IN HERE NOT FOR TWO HOURS BUT FOR TWO DAYS 
ONE NORTHUMBRIAN PEASANT DECIDED HE COULDN'T TAKE ANY MORE 
HIS LORD HAD FREQUENTLY BURDENED HIM WITH HEAVY AND WRONGFUL CLAIMS 
EXTORTING MANY THINGS 
ABOVE HIS YEARLY RENT 
HE GATHERED TOGETHER ALL HE HAD AND SET OUT WITH HIS WIFE AND SONS 
HIS OXEN SHEEP AND LAMBS 
THE RUNAWAY PEASANT WAS HOTLY PURSUED BY THE LORD AND HIS MEN 
ANXIOUS TO RECOVER WHAT THEY SAW AS THEIR PROPERTY 
THE CART AND THE CRIES OF THE HERDSMEN STRUCK THE EAR 
OXEN MOOED SHEEP BAAED HORSES NEIGHED 
AND MEN SHOUTED AT THE ANIMALS SO THAT THE AIR RESOUNDED WITH THE DIN 
THE FUGITIVE FINALLY FOUND A SAFE HAVEN ON THE REMOTE ISLAND OF LINDISFARNE 
BUT HIS STORY IS A RARE EXCEPTION 
FOR MOST SERFS THERE WAS NO ESCAPE 
EVEN IN THE GREAT WILDERNESSES OF MEDIEVAL ENGLAND 
INEQUALITY WAS ENFORCED BY LAW 
IN THE MIDDLE AGES AROUND A THIRD OF THE COUNTRY WAS FOREST 
HUGE SWATHES OF LAND WHERE DEER AND WILD BOAR ROAMED 
WHEREVER YOU LIVED IT WAS LIKELY TO BE WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE 
BUT THE FOREST WAS A DANGEROUS PLACE 
THESE ANCIENT TREES WERE THE SITE OF MEDIEVAL CLASS WAR 
FOREST DIDN'T MEAN JUST WOODLAND 
BUT ANY LAND UNDER THE LAW OF THE FOREST 
ONLY THE KING OR THOSE HE FAVOURED HAD THE RIGHT TO HUNT HERE 
IF A PIECE OF LAND THAT WASN'T 
ALREADY FOREST CAUGHT THE KING'S FANCY HE COULD TURN IT INTO ONE 
WHEN WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR CAME ACROSS THIS HEATHLAND 
TWENTY MILES FROM HIS ROYAL CITY OF WINCHESTER HE WAS ENCHANTED 
WOULDN'T IT BE A WONDERFUL PLACE TO THUNDER ACROSS ON HORSEBACK 
THE HOUNDS BAYING TO HUNT BOAR AND CHASE DEER 
HE TURNED IT INTO HIS OWN PERSONAL PLEASURE GROUND 
NOVA FORESTA 
THE NEW FOREST 
TO CREATE THIS ROYAL PLAYGROUND BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY VILLAGES 
HAD TO BE BROUGHT UNDER THE FOREST LAW 
INHABITANTS WERE EVICTED AND STRICT LAWS ENFORCED 
THE RICH COULD BUY HUNTING RIGHTS FROM THE KING 
THE POOR COULDN'T EVEN CARRY HUNTING WEAPONS 
THE FORESTS WERE POLICED BY THE KING'S SPIES THE HATED FORESTERS 
THE FORESTERS HAD A REPUTATION FOR CRUEL TYRANNY 
TO THEM WROTE THE MONK ADAM OF AYLESHAM VIOLENCE IS LAW 
PILLAGE IS PRAISEWORTHY 
JUSTICE IS HATEFUL 
INNOCENCE IS GUILT 
FROM THEIR EVIL FEROCITY NO RANK OR CONDITION OF MAN SAVE THE KING HIMSELF CAN ESCAPE UNHARMED 
THE FORESTERS HUNTED DOWN ANYONE WHO BROKE THE LAW 
AND BROUGHT THEM TO TRIAL 
THE QUEEN'S HOUSE IN THE NEW FOREST 
HAS BEEN THE SITE OF A FOREST COURT FOR NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS 
ONE SURPRISING REMNANT 
FROM THE SAVAGE FOREST LAWS OF THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD IS THIS STIRRUP 
ITS PURPOSE WAS TO MEASURE THE SIZE OF DOGS 
EVERY DOG IN THE ROYAL FOREST WOULD HAVE TO PASS THROUGH THIS STIRRUP 
ITS HEAD AND ITS WHOLE BODY WOULD HAVE TO GET THROUGH 
YOYO IS OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO MAKE IT 
IF THE DOG WAS TOO BIG 
ITS TOES WOULD BE CUT OFF TO PREVENT IT HUNTING THE ROYAL DEER 
FOR HUMANS IT WAS EVEN CRUELLER 
FOR KILLING A HART OR A HIND 
THE PUNISHMENT WAS BLINDING CASTRATION OR DEATH 
THE WRITER JOHN OF SALISBURY 
VOICED THE HATRED OF ORDINARY PEOPLE FOR THE FOREST LAWS 
ALTHOUGH MAN IS CREATED IN THE IMAGE OF HIM 
KINGS REGARD THE BEASTS OF THE EARTH MORE HIGHLY THAN MAN 
HOW MANY WRETCHES HAVE THEY HANGED ON THE GALLOWS 
FOR TAKING THE FLESH OF WILD ANIMALS 
THEY DO NOT FEAR TO RUIN A MAN ON ACCOUNT OF A BEAST 
THE BRUTALITY OF THESE LAWS CAUSED GREAT BITTERNESS 
AMONGST THE THOUSANDS EXCLUDED FROM THE FOREST 
HUMAN BEINGS MIGHT BE UNEQUAL 
BUT IT WAS STILL THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING CRUELLY UNJUST 
IN THIS SHUTTING OUT OF THE NATURAL WORLD TO ALL EXCEPT THE VERY RICH 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINE ONE MAN WHO HAD KILLED A DEER HUGH THE SCOT 
WAS PURSUED BY FORESTERS 
HE FLED TO THE SANCTUARY OF THE LOCAL CHURCH 
THE FORESTERS WANTED HIM TO STAND TRIAL 
IF THEY'D SUCCEEDED IT WOULD HAVE MEANT THE GALLOWS 
HE HID THERE FOR A MONTH 
THEN HE DISAPPEARED IN DISGUISE 
HE WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN 
RUNNING AWAY FROM THE COURTS TOOK A MAN INTO DANGEROUS TERRITORY 
FROM THAT MOMENT ON HE WAS AN OUTLAW 
SOMEONE LITERALLY OUTSIDE THE LAW A NON PERSON 
HE WAS KNOWN AS WOLVESHEVED WOLF'S HEAD 
BECAUSE LIKE THE WOLVES OF THE FOREST 
THERE WAS NO PUNISHMENT FOR TAKING HIS LIFE 
OUTLAWS TURNED TO ROBBERY TO SURVIVE 
SOME BECAME HEROES GLORIFIED IN STORIES AND SONGS 
COME ALL YOU OUTLAWS 
COME OFF WITH ME TO THE GREEN WOOD OF BELREGARD 
WHERE MEN CAN LIVE FREE 
TREES AND WILD ANIMALS AND THE COOL OF THE SHADE 
FAR FROM THE COURTS WHERE THE LAWS ARE MADE 
THE REALITY FOR AN OUTLAW WAS VERY DIFFERENT 
TRIAL AND CERTAIN DEATH WERE NEVER FAR AWAY 
IT WAS A SEVERE AND RIGID SYSTEM 
EVERYONE HAD THEIR PLACE 
THE LAW DICTATED HOW YOU LIVED AND EVEN WHERE YOU COULD GO 
THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO WORKED 
HAD LITTLE IN COMMON WITH THE LIVES OF THE RULING CLASSES 
SERFS BOUND TO THEIR LORD'S ESTATES 
OUTLAWS TREATED LIKE WOLVES 
FOREST DWELLERS KILLED FOR HUNTING 
AND YET THERE IS NO RECORD OF MAJOR POPULAR INSURRECTIONS OR REVOLTS AT THIS TIME 
THERE WAS A VERY GOOD REASON WHY 
WHEREVER YOU LOOKED THE LANDSCAPE WAS BEING TRANSFORMED 
THE COUNTRY WAS A BUILDING SITE 
FORBIDDING STRUCTURES WERE TAKING SHAPE ALL OVER EUROPE 
THE PEASANT CLASS WAS BEING DRAFTED TO CONSTRUCT BUILDINGS DESIGNED TO OPPRESS THEM 
FROM ONE THOUSAND SIXTY SIX ENGLAND BELONGED TO ONE MAN THE INVADING NORMAN KING 
WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR 
HE PARCELLED OUT THE COUNTRY 
TO THE LEADING FAMILIES WHO HAD FOUGHT FOR HIM 
TO CONTROL THEIR ENORMOUS ESTATES 
THEY BUILT THE FIRST STONE CASTLES IN ENGLAND 
THEY WERE THE POWER BASES 
OF THE SECOND ORDER OF SOCIETY THE MILITARY ARISTOCRACY 
THE MEDIEVAL WORLD WAS STUDDED WITH CASTLES HUNDREDS OF THEM 
THE BONES OF THE KINGDOM 
AS ONE CONTEMPORARY CALLED THEM 
THEY WERE BUILT TO BE HIGH 
TO ACT AS GIANT WATCHTOWERS OVER THE SURROUNDING COUNTRYSIDE 
TO SEE AND TO BE SEEN 
A STONE CASTLE LIKE THIS WOULD BE THE BIGGEST MOST EXPENSIVE 
AND MOST THREATENING BUILDING YOU'D BE LIKELY TO SEE IN YOUR LIFE 
IT WAS A SYMBOL OF THE POWER OF THE ARISTOCRACY 
THE CENTRE OF THEIR GREAT ESTATES AND THE FOUNDATION OF THEIR MILITARY MIGHT 
THE GREAT HALL WAS THE CENTRE OF ARISTOCRATIC LIFE 
WHERE NOBLES WOULD SIT IN THE MIDST OF FAMILY 
SERVANTS ENTERTAINERS AND DOGS 
IN SURROUNDINGS OF LUXURY UNIMAGINABLE TO THE PEASANTRY 
WHAT THEY WERE USED TO WERE HOUSES MADE OF MUD AND TIMBER 
CASTLES LIKE HEDINGHAM 
WERE VISIBLE SYMBOLS OF THE KNIGHT'S RIGHT TO RULE 
THIS INTERNATIONAL CLASS OF FIGHTING MEN 
THE ARISTOCRACY REGARDED THEMSELVES AS A DIFFERENT BREED FROM THE PEASANTS WHO SERVED THEM 
THE WORD ARISTOCRACY MEANS AS MEDIEVAL SCHOLARS KNEW RULE BY THE BEST PEOPLE 
QUITE SIMPLY 
THE NOBLES SAW THEMSELVES AS A BETTER CLASS OF BEING 
IF LAND GAVE THEM THEIR POWER 
IT WAS THEIR BLUE BLOOD THAT ENTITLED THEM TO IT 
BINDING THE ARISTOCRATIC FIGHTING CLASS WAS A CODE OF HONOUR 
THE CODE OF CHIVALRY 
THE ORIGINS OF CHIVALRY HAD LITTLE TO DO WITH GALLANTRY AND ROMANCE 
IT WAS A CODE OF CONDUCT THAT PROTECTED THE ARISTOCRATIC FAMILIES 
AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYONE BENEATH THEM 
ABOVE ALL CHIVALRY WAS A FORM OF CASTE SOLIDARITY 
THE GLUE THAT HELD THE WARRING CLASS TOGETHER 
THIS IS HOW THE CATALAN KNIGHT RAMON LULL 
DESCRIBES THE CHIVALRIC CODE 
ACCORDING TO HIM AFTER PROTECTING GOD AND THE KING 
THE KNIGHT'S NEXT DUTIES ARE TO GO HUNTING GIVE LAVISH FEASTS 
AND FIGHT IN TOURNAMENTS 
AFTER THAT HE MUST ENSURE THAT HE TERRORISES THE PEASANTRY 
FOR BECAUSE OF THE DREAD THAT THE COMMON PEOPLE HAVE OF THE KNIGHTS 
THEY LABOUR AND CULTIVATE THE EARTH 
FOR FEAR LEST THEY BE DESTROYED 
BUT THE CENTRAL DUTY OF THE KNIGHT WAS TO GO TO WAR 
IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR CASTLES LANDS AND PEASANTS 
THIS CLASS NOT ONLY CONTROLLED THE POPULATION 
BUT WOULD BE EXPECTED TO FIGHT FOR THE KING 
FOR THEM WAR WAS THE NATURAL STATE OF LIFE AND WARFARE WAS ENNOBLING 
IT WAS IN WAR THAT THEY COULD WIN HONOUR RICHES AND EVEN MORE LAND 
MEDIEVAL KNIGHTS LIVED FOR THE GLORY OF THE BATTLEFIELD 
I LOVE THE GAY EASTERTIDE 
WHICH BRINGS FORTH LEAVES AND FLOWERS 
AND I LOVE THE JOYOUS SONGS OF THE BIRDS ECHOING THROUGH THE COPSE 
BUT I ALSO LOVE TO SEE 
AMIDST THE MEADOWS KNIGHTS AND HORSES IN BATTLE ARRAY 
AND MY HEART IS FILLED WITH GLADNESS WHEN I SEE MANY VASSALS STRUCK 
DOWN TOGETHER AND THE HORSES OF THE DEAD AND WOUNDED ROVING AT RANDOM 
CHIVALRY FOUND ITS IDEAL IN EDWARD THE BLACK PRINCE 
THE BLACK PRINCE WAS THE QUINTESSENTIAL ARISTOCRATIC KNIGHT 
DEEPLY RELIGIOUS A SUPERB WARRIOR AND WITH ABOVE EVERYTHING AN UNSHAKEABLE SENSE OF HONOUR 
HE COULD BE MERCILESS TO ANYBODY ELSE 
SOME PEOPLE SAY HE GOT HIS NAME FROM HIS DISTINCTIVE ARMOUR 
BURNISHED AND DARKENED FOR BATTLE 
BUT ACCORDING TO OTHERS IT'S A MEMORY OF HIS RUTHLESS CAMPAIGNS IN FRANCE 
THERE THEY SAY HE SHOWED THAT IT WAS NOT HIS ARMOUR THAT WAS BLACK 
BUT HIS HEART 
THE FRENCH CITY OF LIMOGES HAD SWORN ALLEGIANCE TO THE BLACK PRINCE 
BUT IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY THE CITIZENS WENT OVER TO THE KING OF FRANCE 
THE BLACK PRINCE WAS FURIOUS THAT THEY HAD BROKEN THEIR OATH 
IN HIS EYES A TREASONABLE ACT 
HE SET OUT WITH HIS ARMY TO EXACT REVENGE 
THE CHRONICLER JEAN FROISSART DESCRIBED THE HORRIFIC SCENE 
PILLAGERS RAN THROUGH THE TOWN SLAYING MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN 
THEY CAST THEMSELVES ON THEIR KNEES BEFORE THE PRINCE BEGGING FOR MERCY 
BUT HE WAS SO INFLAMED WITH PASSION AND REVENGE THAT HE LISTENED TO NONE 
BUT ALL WERE PUT TO THE SWORD 
UPWARDS OF THREE THOUSAND MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE PUT TO DEATH THAT DAY 
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT HIGHLIGHTS THE STARTLING INEQUALITIES 
THAT LAY AT THE HEART OF THE CODE OF CHIVALRY 
WHILE THE ORDINARY FRENCH TOWNSPEOPLE WERE BUTCHERED 
THE ENEMY FRENCH KNIGHTS MET A VERY DIFFERENT FATE 
WHEN IT WAS CLEAR THAT THEY'D LOST THEY APPEALED TO THE BLACK PRINCE 
MY LORDS WE ARE YOURS 
YOU HAVE VANQUISHED US 
ACT THEREFORE ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF WAR 
BY GOD REPLIED THE PRINCE'S KNIGHTS 
WE WOULD DO NO OTHERWISE AND ACCEPT YOU AS OUR PRISONERS 
ACCORDING TO THE CODE OF CHIVALRY ON THE MEDIEVAL BATTLEFIELD 
FELLOW KNIGHTS EVEN ON OPPOSING SIDES LOOKED AFTER THEIR OWN CLASS 
IT WAS THE LOWER ORDERS THE COMMONERS WHO PAID THE PRICE WITH THEIR LIVES 
WITH THEIR WEALTH AND CASTLES THEIR PASSION FOR WAR 
AND THEIR MARTIAL BOND OF CHIVALRY 
THE MEDIEVAL FIGHTING CLASS WAS A FORMIDABLE FORCE 
AGGRESSION AND BLOODLUST RAN IN THE VEINS OF THE WARRIOR CASTE 
AND JUST AS THEY THEMSELVES HELD DOWN THE PEASANTRY SO TOO 
THIS AGGRESSIVE AND COMPETITIVE CLASS HAD TO BE HELD IN CHECK 
THE MAN TO DO THIS HAD TO BE UNIQUE 
SET APART FROM THE REST OF HUMANITY 
CHOSEN IN FACT BY GOD 
FIRST HE HAD TO BE TRANSFORMED ELEVATED ABOVE ORDINARY PEOPLE 
IT IS HERE AT WESTMINSTER ABBEY 
THAT THIS EXTRAORDINARY TRANSFORMATION HAS TAKEN PLACE 
EVER SINCE THE TIME OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR 
THE CORONATION CEREMONY EVOKES THE MYSTICAL NAMES OF JESUS AND SOLOMON 
IT TURNS A MAN INTO A LEADER TOUCHED BY DIVINITY 
FOR NEARLY ONE THOUSAND YEARS EVERY ENGLISH MONARCH HAS WALKED DOWN 
THIS AISLE TO BE TRANSFORMED BY AN ANCIENT CEREMONY THE CORONATION 
WITH ITS ROOTS GOING BACK TO THE OLD TESTAMENT THIS WAS FAR MORE 
THAN SOME ELABORATE RITUAL DESIGNED TO IMPRESS THE POPULATION 
TO THE MEDIEVAL MIND THIS WAS THE PRECISE MOMENT 
WHEN GOD SINGLES OUT ONE PERSON HIS CHOSEN REPRESENTATIVE ON EARTH 
SHELTERED BENEATH A CANOPY OF SILK BORNE ON FOUR LANCES 
THE NEW KING MADE HIS WAY 
TOWARDS GOD'S INTERMEDIARY THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY 
THE KING KNELT BEFORE THIS ALTAR AND SWORE A SOLEMN OATH 
HE PROMISED TO PROTECT THE CHURCH TO REPRESS WRONGDOING AND TO ADMINISTER JUSTICE 
AS HE ROSE THE CHOIR BEGAN TO SING 
ZADOK THE PRIEST BY G. F. HANDEL 
THE ARCHBISHOP ANOINTED HIS BODY WITH HOLY OIL 
SIGNIFYING THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT UPON THE NEW KING 
HE IS GIVEN THE GOLDEN ORB AND SCEPTRE SYMBOLS OF GOD'S POWER ON EARTH AND OF ROYAL AUTHORITY 
THEN THE CROWN IS PLACED UPON HIS HEAD 
THE TRANSFORMATION WAS NOW COMPLETE 
HE WHO HAD BEEN A MERE MORTAL EMERGED AS THE LORD'S ANOINTED 
AN EARLY MEDIEVAL KING STARTED HIS REIGN WITH SOME CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGES 
HE HAD GOD ON HIS SIDE 
HE WAS LORD OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY 
HE COULD GIVE OR TAKE AWAY VAST TRACTS OF LAND CASTLES AND PROPERTY 
HIS SUBJECTS WERE AT THE MERCY OF HIS WILL 
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT FOR ARISTOCRATS STAYING CLOSE TO THE KING WAS CRUCIAL 
BUT NOT TOO CLOSE 
AS A CONTEMPORARY WISELY OBSERVED A KING IS LIKE A FIRE 
IF YOU'RE TOO FAR AWAY YOU FREEZE 
IF YOU'RE TOO CLOSE YOU BURN 
CONTROLLING THE ARISTOCRACY 
WAS THE KING'S MOST IMPORTANT DUTY 
AS THE KNIGHT HUBERT DE BURGH DISCOVERED TO HIS COST 
HIS VAST ESTATES STRETCHING FROM NORFOLK TO SOMERSET 
MADE HIM ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST MEN IN THIRTEENTH CENTURY ENGLAND 
BUT THE KING BLAMED HUBERT FOR THE FAILURE OF HIS MILITARY CAMPAIGNS 
HE WAS STRIPPED OF HIS POSSESSIONS AND THREATENED WITH THE TOWER 
A KING MIGHT BE LORD OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY BUT HOW COULD HE EXERCISE 
REAL POWER OVER AN ENTIRE KINGDOM AT A TIME WHEN NOTHING MOVED FASTER THAN A HORSE 
THE AVERAGE RATE OF TRAVEL WITH GOOD WEATHER 
HEALTHY MOUNTS AND LUCK WAS NO MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE MILES A DAY 
TO GET A LETTER FROM ONE END OF THE KINGDOM TO THE OTHER AND A REPLY 
MIGHT TAKE THREE WEEKS BY WHICH TIME AN AMBITIOUS ARISTOCRAT COULD HAVE SEIZED AN ENTIRE REGION 
FOR A KING LIKE HENRY THE SECOND THE CHALLENGE WAS IMMENSE 
IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY HIS VAST EMPIRE STRETCHED 
FROM THE HIGHLANDS OF CUMBRIA TO THE SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN 
LIKE MANY MEDIEVAL KINGS HE TRAVELLED 
THE FAMOUSLY ENERGETIC HENRY WAS ALWAYS ON THE MOVE 
THIS WAS A GOVERNMENT OF THE ROADSIDE 
THIS TRAVELLING COURT RODE FROM CITY TO PALACE TO CASTLE SOMETIMES CAMPING OUT IN THE FIELDS 
ITS PURPOSE WAS NOT ONLY TO EXERCISE THE KING'S AUTHORITY BUT ALSO TO FEED HIS LARGE AND HUNGRY RETINUE 
EVERYWHERE THE KING'S COURT WENT 
IT SUCKED UP THE FOOD AND SUPPLIES OF THE KING'S SUBJECTS 
ACCORDING TO THE COURTIER PETER OF BLOIS TRAVELLING WITH THE KING COULD BE A GRIM BUSINESS 
THE LIFE OF THE COURT IS DEATH TO THE SOUL 
EVERY DAY IS UNPREDICTABLE 
THERE MAY BE A LAST MINUTE CHANGE OF PLAN TAKING THE COURT TO SOME 
DESOLATE SPOT WHERE THERE IS A ROOF AND DINNER ONLY FOR THE KING 
SO AFTER WANDERING THREE OR FOUR MILES THROUGH UNFAMILIAR WOODLAND 
OFTEN IN DARKNESS THE COURTIERS 
FIGHT WITH THEIR SWORDS FOR LODGINGS UNWORTHY FOR PIGS TO QUARREL OVER 
AS THEY TRAVELLED AROUND THEIR KINGDOM MEDIEVAL MONARCHS WERE LIKE THE OWNERS OF A BIG FAMILY BUSINESS 
KEEPING AN EYE ON ALL THE BRANCHES OF THE FIRM 
BUT MEMBERS OF A FAMILY BUSINESS HAVE A HABIT OF FALLING OUT 
A DOMESTIC DISPUTE IN THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD 
COULD BRING THE COUNTRY TO ITS KNEES 
FEW QUARRELS WERE MORE DESTRUCTIVE 
THAN THE ONE BETWEEN QUEEN ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND EDWARD THE SECOND 
BORN IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE ISABELLA WAS THE SISTER OF THE KING OF FRANCE 
AND SAID TO BE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE ROSE 
BUT HER LOOKS WERE WASTED ON HER HUSBAND EDWARD 
HIS TASTES WERE UNCONVENTIONAL 
HE PREFERRED FISHING TO HUNTING 
BANQUETS TO BATTLES 
AND BEAUTIFUL YOUNG MEN TO ISABELLA 
HIS CONTEMPORARIES WERE SCANDALISED 
OH INSANE FOOLISHNESS OF THE KING TO BE REPROVED BY GOD AND MEN 
HE LOVED UNLAWFUL SEX AND REMOVED FROM HIS SIDE SWEET CONJUGAL EMBRACES IN CONTEMPT OF HIS NATURE 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ISABELLA AND EDWARD DETERIORATED 
HE SET SPIES IN HER HOUSEHOLD AND REDUCED HER INCOME 
WHEN SHE WAS SENT AS AN AMBASSADOR TO FRANCE SHE REFUSED TO RETURN A MARRIAGE 
SHE WROTE IS A JOINING TOGETHER OF MAN AND WOMAN MAINTAINING THE UNDIVIDED HABIT OF LIFE 
NOW SOMEONE HAS COME BETWEEN MY HUSBAND AND ME TRYING TO BREAK THAT BOND 
I PROTEST THAT I WILL NOT RETURN UNTIL THE INTRUDER IS REMOVED 
A MEDIEVAL QUEEN WITH HER WEALTH AND CONNECTIONS WAS A DANGEROUS ENEMY 
IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX ISABELLA RETURNED TO ENGLAND WITH A PRIVATE ARMY 
THIS TIME HER EYES WERE ON THE THRONE 
THE POPULATION DIVIDED BETWEEN SUPPORTERS OF THE QUEEN 
AND SUPPORTERS OF THE KING RATHER FEWER OF THOSE 
THE CHURCH BECAME INVOLVED 
WHEN THE HEAD OF THE KINGDOM BECOMES SICK AND DISEASED 
PREACHED THE BISHOP OF HEREFORD IT MUST OF NECESSITY BE TAKEN OFF 
WITHOUT USELESS ATTEMPTS TO ADMINISTER FURTHER REMEDIES 
THE MARITAL CONFLICT HAD BECOME A NATIONAL CRISIS 
EDWARD FLED TO WALES 
ISABELLA'S VENGEANCE WAS RUTHLESS 
SHE STARTED WITH THE KING'S FAVOURITE HUGH DE SPENCER 
THE CHRONICLER JEAN FROISSART DESCRIBED HIS EXECUTION 
HIS MEMBER AND HIS TESTICLES WERE FIRST CUT OFF BECAUSE 
HE WAS A HERETIC AND A SODOMITE EVEN IT WAS SAID WITH THE KING 
AND THE KING'S FATE WAS NOT MUCH BETTER 
EDWARD WAS IMPRISONED AT BERKELEY CASTLE AND IN SEPTEMBER ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN HE WAS ATTACKED BY ISABELLA'S MEN 
A CONTEMPORARY DESCRIBED WHAT HAPPENED NEXT 
HE WAS IGNOMINIOUSLY SLAIN WITH A RED HOT SPIT THRUST INTO THE ANUS 
A KING'S DIVINE AUTHORITY COUNTED FOR LITTLE WITHIN HIS OWN HOME 
WHAT STARTED AS A DISPUTE BETWEEN MAN AND WIFE ENDED 
IN A ROYAL MURDER AND TOOK THE COUNTRY TO THE BRINK OF CIVIL WAR 
A VIOLENT ARISTOCRACY ENDLESS TRAVELLING CONFLICT WITHIN HIS OWN FAMILY 
HOW WAS A KING TO KEEP ON TOP OF ALL THIS 
MACHIAVELLI GAVE THE RULER SOME FAMOUS ADVICE 
IT IS BEST TO BE BOTH FEARED AND LOVED 
BUT IF YOU CAN'T BE BOTH IT'S BETTER TO BE FEARED 
IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY KING JOHN MIGHT HAVE TAKEN THESE WORDS AS HIS PERSONAL MOTTO 
HE WAS BRUTAL AND MISTRUSTFUL 
BUT TO BE FEARED WAS NOT ENOUGH 
HIS DISASTROUS REIGN EXPOSED THE PERILS OF UNCHECKED ROYAL POWER 
AND TRANSFORMED OUR IDEAS OF KINGSHIP 
EVERY MEDIEVAL KING HAD TO LIVE HOWEVER UNCOMFORTABLY WITH THE POWER OF THE CHURCH 
IT HAD WEALTH LAND AND HUGE INFLUENCE 
THIS SO CALLED FIRST ORDER 
OF MEDIEVAL SOCIETY WAS LIKE A STATE WITHIN A STATE 
WITH ITS OWN HIERARCHY IT WAS A POWERFUL FORCE IN THIS WORLD 
SO THE APPOINTMENT OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY 
THE HEAD OF THE ENGLISH CHURCH WAS A MATTER OF ENORMOUS POLITICAL IMPORTANCE 
WHEN THE POPE OVERRULED JOHN'S CHOICE OF ARCHBISHOP 
IT LED IMMEDIATELY TO CONFRONTATION AND CRISIS 
ONE CHRONICLER DESCRIBED HIS REACTION 
HE BECAME NEARLY MAD WITH RAGE 
AND BROKE FORTH IN WORDS OF BLASPHEMY 
AND SWORE BY GOD'S TEETH TO SEND ALL THE CHURCH CLERKS TO ROME 
WITH THEIR EYES PLUCKED OUT AND THEIR NOSES SLIT 
JOHN WAS SO FURIOUS AT BEING OVERRULED THAT HE BANISHED ALL THE MONKS AT CANTERBURY 
THE POPE WAS READY TO STRIKE BACK 
FOR THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME IN ENGLISH HISTORY 
THE ENTIRE APPARATUS OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH CAME TO A HALT 
THE PULPITS FELL SILENT 
THE PARISH PRIEST SENT HOME 
CHURCH SERVICES WERE FORBIDDEN 
THERE WERE NO MARRIAGES AND NO BURIALS IN CONSECRATED GROUND 
FOR SIX YEARS THE CHURCHES OF ENGLAND WERE EMPTY 
JOHN FARED NO BETTER WITH THE OTHER AXIS OF MEDIEVAL POWER THE ARISTOCRACY 
HE DISINHERITED SOME WITHOUT JUDGEMENT 
AND CONDEMNED OTHERS TO A DIRE DEATH 
HE VIOLATED THEIR WIVES AND DAUGHTERS 
HIS ONLY LAW WAS HIS DESPOTIC WILL 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHT MATILDA DE BRAOSE THE WIFE OF A FAVOURED COURTIER 
LET SLIP IN COMPANY THAT KING JOHN HAD MURDERED HIS OWN NEPHEW 
JOHN WAS ENRAGED 
HE SEIZED HER PROPERTY AND SENT AN ARMY TO PURSUE HER 
MATILDA AND HER SON WERE TAKEN TO CORFE CASTLE IN DORSET 
THEY WERE LOCKED UP 
AND SIMPLY LEFT TO DIE 
JOHN'S BRUTALITY WAS MATCHED BY HIS INCOMPETENCE IN WAR 
BY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN HE'D LOST ALMOST ALL HIS TERRITORIES IN FRANCE 
THE FRENCH KING WAS THREATENING TO INVADE 
JOHN CAME UP WITH A DESPERATE SOLUTION 
HOPING TO GET THE CHURCH BACK ON HIS SIDE HE RECOGNISED THE POPE 
AS HIS FEUDAL OVERLORD IN EFFECT GRANTING HIM POWER OVER THE KINGDOM 
BY NOW KING JOHN WAS FACING OPPOSITION FROM ALL SIDES NOT ONLY FROM THE KING OF FRANCE 
BUT ALSO FROM THE CHURCH AND HIS OWN ARISTOCRACY 
HE HAD MANAGED TO ALIENATE EVERYONE IN MEDIEVAL SOCIETY WHO MATTERED 
IT WAS A TEXTBOOK LESSON IN HOW NOT TO EXERCISE POWER IN THE MEDIEVAL WORLD 
THE ARISTOCRACY DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO REBEL 
THE KING'S POWER HAD TO BE CURTAILED 
ON THE SEVENTEENTH MAY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN THE REBEL BARONS SEIZED LONDON 
THEY ACCUSED JOHN OF ACTING ABOVE THE LAW 
SEIZING LAND AND KILLING HIS SUBJECTS AT WILL 
THEY DEMANDED SOMETHING QUITE NEW A CONTRACT MAKING THE KING ANSWERABLE TO THE LAW 
MAGNA CARTA 
FOR MANY PEOPLE THIS IS THE SOURCE AND FOUNTAIN OF WESTERN LIBERTY 
MAGNA CARTA IS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS DOCUMENTS IN ENGLISH HISTORY 
BUT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY READ IT IT CAN BE RATHER DISAPPOINTING 
IT HAS NO STIRRING STATEMENTS ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF MAN OR ALL MEN BEING CREATED EQUAL 
IN FACT IT HAS RATHER MORE TO SAY ABOUT FISH WEIRS ON THE THAMES AND INHERITANCE TAX 
BUT IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS DETAIL A FEW CLAUSES STILL RING OUT A CLEAR MESSAGE 
NO FREE MAN SHALL BE SEIZED IMPRISONED DISPOSSESSED OUTLAWED EXILED OR RUINED IN ANY WAY 
NOR SHALL WE ATTACK HIM EXCEPT BY THE LAWFUL JUDGEMENT OF HIS PEERS AND THE LAW OF THE LAND 
OR THIS 
TO NO ONE WILL WE SELL DENY OR DELAY RIGHT OR JUSTICE 
THE REVERBERATIONS OF THIS CRUCIAL CLAUSE ARE WITH US TO THIS DAY 
WHEN WE DEBATE WHETHER WE CAN JUSTIFY IMPRISONING TERRORIST SUSPECTS FOR TWENTY EIGHT DAYS OR FIFTY SIX DAYS 
OR NINETY DAYS WE'RE REFERRING BACK TO THE PRINCIPLES IN THIS DOCUMENT SEALED BY JOHN IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
IT WAS A REVOLUTIONARY MOMENT 
ROYAL WHIM WOULD NO LONGER DECIDE THE FATE OF A SUBJECT 
MAGNA CARTA WAS THE BEGINNING OF AN IRREVERSIBLE PROCESS 
THE SHIFTING OF POWER AWAY FROM THE KING TOWARDS HIS SUBJECTS 
INSIDE THIS BUILDING IS AN ENORMOUS CHAMBER KNOWN AT THE TIME AS THE MOST CAPACIOUS ROOM IN CHRISTENDOM 
IT WAS HERE THAT THE KING GATHERED HIS MOST POWERFUL MEN WHEN HE NEEDED TO DISCUSS MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE 
WAR INHERITANCE RELATIONS WITH THE CHURCH 
AND IT WAS THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT GAVE THIS NEW INSTITUTION ITS NAME 
FROM THE FRENCH WORD PARLEZ TO TALK 
THIS IS WESTMINSTER HALL THE HEART OF THE PALACE OF WESTMINSTER 
THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT 
WESTMINSTER HALL HAS BEEN IN CONTINUOUS USE FOR NINE HUNDRED YEARS 
MEDIEVAL KINGS TOOK ADVICE HERE FROM FAVOURED LORDS AND CLERGY 
WHAT WE THINK OF TODAY AS PARLIAMENT A PLACE WHERE LAWS ARE MADE EVOLVED HERE 
NOT BECAUSE MEDIEVAL MONARCHS WANTED DEMOCRACY 
BUT BECAUSE THEY NEEDED CASH 
IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY A SERIES OF EXPENSIVE WARS MEANT THE KING HAD TO INCREASE TAXES EVERYBODY'S TAXES 
TO AVOID OPEN REVOLT HE HAD TO OPEN UP THESE ASSEMBLIES TO OTHERS BEYOND EARLS AND BARONS 
TO THOSE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN THE SOCIAL SCALE 
EVENTUALLY INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE EMERGING MERCHANT CLASS 
FROM SUCH PROSAIC NECESSITY WAS DEMOCRACY BORN 
BUT IT WAS STILL ONLY THE WORDS OF THE WEALTHY THAT REACHED UP INTO THESE GREAT RAFTERS 
THE POOR REMAINED UNHEARD 
DESPITE THE ADVANCES IN COMMON LAW MAGNA CARTA THE GROWTH OF PARLIAMENT 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY ONE THIRD OF THE POPULATION 
WAS STILL LIVING IN BONDAGE TIED TO THE ESTATES OF THE RICH 
LIFE HAD CHANGED VERY LITTLE FOR THEM 
IT WOULD TAKE AN ACT OF GOD TO SET THEM FREE 
THE SEEDS OF THIS DRAMATIC CHANGE 
WERE SOWN IN THE SOUTHERN PORT OF MELCOMBE REGIS IN JULY ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT 
THEY WERE PLANTED SILENTLY AND AT FIRST WENT ALMOST UNNOTICED 
BUT WITHIN A FEW DAYS THE IMPACT WAS IRREVERSIBLE 
THE BLACK DEATH HAD ARRIVED IN BRITAIN 
A WELSH POET OBSERVING A LATER OUTBREAK OF THE PLAGUE DESCRIBED ITS SYMPTOMS 
WE SEE DEATH COMING INTO OUR MIDST LIKE BLACK SMOKE 
A ROOTLESS PHANTOM THAT HAS NO MERCY NOR FAIR COUNTENANCE 
WOE IS ME OF THE SHILLING IN THE ARMPIT 
IT IS TERRIBLE SEETHING A PAINFUL ANGRY KNOB 
A WHITE LUMP A SMALL BOIL THAT SPARES NO ONE 
THE DISEASE SCYTHED THROUGH THE POPULATION 
IT MADE ITS WAY ALONG THE COAST BY SOUTHAMPTON 
WHERE ALMOST THE WHOLE STRENGTH OF THE TOWN PERISHED 
FEW KEPT THEIR BEDS MORE THAN TWO OR THREE DAYS OR EVEN HALF A DAY 
WITHIN SIX MONTHS THE DISEASE HAD DECIMATED CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
A CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY REPORTED FROM OXFORD 
THE UNIVERSITY IS RUINED AND ENFEEBLED BY PESTILENCE 
THIRTY THOUSAND SCHOLARS 
AND NOW ONLY SIX THOUSAND REMAIN 
WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS HALF THE POPULATION OF ENGLAND WAS DEAD 
THE WORLD AFTER THE PLAGUE LOOKED DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT 
ENTIRE VILLAGES LAY DESERTED 
THERE WAS NO ONE TO WORK THE LAND 
WITH FEWER PEOPLE AVAILABLE THE DEMAND FOR LABOUR WENT UP AND SO DID THE PRICE 
LABOURERS WOULD NO LONGER BE AT THE BECK AND CALL OF THEIR LORDS 
TAKE THE RESPONSE OF WILLIAM OF CAYBURN A LINCOLNSHIRE PLOUGHMAN 
WILLIAM WE ARE TOLD DID NOT WANT TO WORK EXCEPT AT A DAILY RATE 
AND HE DID NOT WANT TO EAT SALT MEAT BUT FRESH MEAT 
AND ON ACCOUNT OF THAT HE LEFT THE VILLAGE 
SUCH MEN SENSED THE WAY THE WIND WAS BLOWING 
THE THIRD ORDER OF MEDIEVAL SOCIETY THOSE WHO WORKED WAS BEGINNING TO TASTE A NEW FREEDOM 
THE AUTHORITIES PANICKED 
JUST A YEAR AFTER THE PLAGUE IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE 
THEY RUSHED THROUGH A LAW TO FREEZE THE WAGES OF LABOURERS 
THEY PASSED ANOTHER STOPPING THEM FROM TRAVELLING TO LOOK FOR WORK 
THEY EVEN BROUGHT IN A LAW AIMED AT BRANDING EVERY PERSON ACCORDING TO THEIR STATUS 
THIS NEW LAW WAS DESIGNED TO MAKE THE CLASS SYSTEM VISIBLE 
IT DICTATED IN VERY PRECISE TERMS WHAT YOU COULD WEAR 
A PEASANT MUST LOOK LIKE A PEASANT OR FACE THE CONSEQUENCES 
PEASANTS TO WEAR CLOTHES MADE FROM CLOTH WORTH LESS THAN TWO MARKS 
AND NOT TO WEAR ANYTHING OF GOLD SILVER OR SILK 
SQUIRES AND GENTLEMEN WITH LAND WORTH LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED A YEAR 
TO WEAR CLOTH WORTH LESS THAN FOUR AND A HALF MARKS 
KNIGHTS WITH LAND WORTH UP TO TWO HUNDRED 
TO WEAR CLOTHES MADE FROM CLOTH WORTH SIX MARKS 
SUCH DESPERATE ATTEMPTS TO BIND THE PEASANTS TO THEIR OLD WAY OF LIFE 
ONLY FUELLED CENTURIES OF FRUSTRATION 
SO WHEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE NEW KING RICHARD THE SECOND 
TRIED TO RAISE TAXES ON THIS DIMINISHED POPULATION 
CLASS TENSION REACHED BREAKING POINT 
REBELLION BROKE OUT 
THE REBELS ATTACKED HATED SYMBOLS OF POWER 
THEY BURNED PILES OF LEGAL DOCUMENTS 
TO DESTROY ANY RECORD OF THEIR SUBJECTION 
IN CAMBRIDGE THE UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES WERE THROWN ONTO A BONFIRE 
WHILE THE REBELS CRIED AWAY WITH THE LEARNING OF THE CLERKS AWAY WITH IT 
THEN VIOLENCE CAME TO THE CAPITAL 
WORD OF THE REBELLION SPREAD FAST AND ON TWELFTH JUNE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE 
FIFTY THOUSAND PEASANTS ACCORDING TO ONE CHRONICLER 
DESCENDED ON THE FIELDS OF BLACKHEATH 
WAITING FOR THE ORDER TO ATTACK THE CITY WHICH LAY BELOW 
THE RESTLESS CROWD WERE ROUSED INTO A MURDEROUS MOOD BY THE RADICAL PRIEST JOHN BALL 
GOOD PEOPLE THINGS CANNOT GO RIGHT IN ENGLAND 
AND NEVER WILL UNTIL GOODS ARE HELD IN COMMON AND THERE ARE 
NO MORE SERFS AND GENTLEFOLK BUT WE ARE ALL ONE AND THE SAME 
THEY ARE CLAD IN VELVET WHILE WE GO DRESSED IN COARSE CLOTH 
THEY HAVE WINES SPICES AND GOOD BREAD 
WE HAVE STRAW AND WE DRINK WATER 
THEY HAVE SHELTER AND EASE WE HAVE HARDSHIP AND TOIL THE WIND AND THE RAIN 
LET US GO TO THE KING AND SHOW HIM HOW WE ARE OPPRESSED AND TELL HIM 
THAT WE WANT THINGS TO BE CHANGED OR ELSE WE WILL CHANGE THEM OURSELVES 
THE INCREDIBLE WAS HAPPENING 
THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF INEQUALITY WAS BEING CHALLENGED 
THE NATURAL ORDER WAS UNDER THREAT 
NOTHING LIKE THIS HAD EVER BEEN SEEN IN ENGLAND BEFORE 
THE NEXT DAY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE MARCHED ON LONDON 
THEY BURNED DOWN THE SAVOY PALACE ON THE SITE OF TODAY'S SAVOY HOTEL 
THEN THEY HEADED FOR THE TOWER OF LONDON LED BY WAT TYLER 
THEY WERE AFTER ONE OF THE CHIEF ARCHITECTS OF THE HATED POLL TAX THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY 
THE ARCHBISHOP HAD PASSED THE PREVIOUS NIGHT IN CONFESSION 
HERE IN SAINT JOHN'S CHAPEL 
ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF THE REBELS CONSTANTLY ASKING WHEN WILL THEY COME 
HE SPENT THE TIME DEEP IN PRAYER CHANTING PSALMS AND THE HOLY LITANY 
AND AS HE SAID THE WORDS OMNES SANCTI ORATE PRO NOBIS 
PRAY FOR US ALL THE SAINTS 
THE REBELS BURST IN AND SEIZED HIM FROM HIS PRAYERS 
THEY DRAGGED THE ARCHBISHOP THROUGH THE PASSAGES 
BY HIS ARMS AND HIS HOOD TO TOWER HILL 
WHERE ALONG WITH THE TREASURER OF ENGLAND HE WAS BEHEADED 
THE HEADS PLACED ON STAKES WERE PARADED THROUGH THE CITY 
BY THE END OF THE DAY 
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY PEOPLE HAD BEEN BEHEADED AND LONDON WAS IN CHAOS 
THE REBELS FOLLOWING THEIR LEADER WAT TYLER 
MET WITH THE YOUNG KING RICHARD ONLY FOURTEEN AT THIS TIME 
IN AN OUTRAGEOUS BREACH OF PROTOCOL WAT TYLER OFFERED THE KING HIS HAND 
SAYING BROTHER BE OF GOOD COMFORT 
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE WAVES OF HATRED EMANATING FROM THE NOBILITY 
NO PEASANT HAD EVER SPOKEN TO A KING LIKE THAT 
THIS WAS A CRITICAL MOMENT IN WHICH THE POWER STRUCTURES OF THE MEDIEVAL WORLD SEEMED ABOUT TO SHIFT 
THE KING WAS SO OUTNUMBERED BY THE REBELS 
THAT HE WAS FORCED TO LISTEN TO TYLER'S EXTRAORDINARY DEMANDS 
AN END TO SERFDOM 
NO LORDS EXCEPT THE KING 
THE PROPERTY OF THE CHURCH TO BE DIVIDED AMONGST THE PEOPLE 
EVEN MORE EXTRAORDINARY THE KING AGREED 
FIGHTING BROKE OUT 
TYLER WAS KILLED BY THE KING'S SOLDIERS 
THE TERRIFIED REBELS FLED 
THE LEADERS WERE BEHEADED THEIR HEADS PLACED ON STAKES ON LONDON BRIDGE 
THE YOUNG KING TOLD HIS DISCONTENTED SUBJECTS JUST WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THEM 
SERFS YOU WERE AND SERFS YOU ARE STILL 
YOU WILL REMAIN IN BONDAGE AS LONG AS WE LIVE 
AND BY GOD'S GRACE RULE OVER THE REALM 
WE WILL STRIVE TO SUPPRESS YOU 
SO YOUR SERVITUDE WILL BE AN EXAMPLE TO POSTERITY 
PEOPLE LIKE YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR MISERY AS AN EXAMPLE 
BEFORE THEIR EYES AND WILL FEAR TO DO THE THINGS YOU HAVE DONE 
HIS WORDS SOUND LIKE THE ECHO OF A VANISHING WORLD 
SOCIAL CHANGE WAS UNSTOPPABLE 
THE FORCES THAT HAD HELD ALL THE CLASSES IN CHECK FOR SO LONG WERE WEAKENING 
THE BLACK DEATH HAD CRACKED THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE HIERARCHY 
WITHIN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY SERFDOM DISAPPEARED FROM ENGLAND 
AND AS NEW CITIES GREW A CLASS MADE RICH ON BUSINESS 
LAW AND TRADE BEGAN TO FLEX ITS MUSCLES 
THIS NEW MERCHANT CLASS WAS HUNGRY FOR INFLUENCE 
EWELME IN OXFORDSHIRE WAS THE HOME OF ALICE CHAUCER 
THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF GEOFFREY CHAUCER THE WRITER 
THROUGH CLEVER MARRIAGES AND CONTACTS AT COURT 
THIS MERCHANT FAMILY BEGAN TO RISE IN THE WORLD 
ALICE COULD AFFORD TO BUILD A MANOR HOUSE A CHURCH A SCHOOL EVEN AN ALMSHOUSE FOR THE POOR 
GREAT CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS LIKE THIS 
WERE NOT UNCOMMON IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
BUT THEY WERE USUALLY THE PRESERVE OF THE VERY VERY RICH 
IT'S A SIGN OF HOW FAR THE CHAUCER FAMILY HAD COME IN JUST TWO GENERATIONS 
JUST WHAT ALICE'S FAMILY ACHIEVED 
CAN BE FOUND IN THE CHURCH AT EWELME 
THIS WONDERFUL ALABASTER TOMB 
IS MORE THAN A MEMORIAL TO ALICE AND HER RELIGIOUS DEVOTION 
IT'S A STATEMENT THAT THE CHAUCER FAMILY HAD ARRIVED 
AT THE VERY TOP OF ENGLISH SOCIETY 
WHEN ALICE DIED IN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE 
SHE HAD MARRIED OFF HER SON TO THE KING'S SISTER 
HER ONCE MODEST FAMILY HAD BEEN CATAPULTED INTO ROYAL CIRCLES 
HER TOMB PROUDLY DISPLAYS THIS DAZZLING ASCENT 
CRESTS OF ALL THE POWERFUL FAMILIES WHO THROUGH MARRIAGE 
CARRIED THE CHAUCERS UP THE SOCIAL SCALE ARE ON SHOW 
INCLUDING THE ROYAL CREST OF ALICE'S DAUGHTER IN LAW ELIZABETH PLANTAGENET 
THE INSCRIPTION ON HER TOMB READS 
ORATE PRO ANIMA SERENISSIMAE PRINCIPESSAE ALICIAE 
PRAY FOR THE SOUL OF THE MOST SERENE PRINCESS ALICE 
AN OUTRAGEOUS PIECE OF SELF PROMOTION 
SHE WAS THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A WINE MERCHANT'S SON 
HER GRANDSON WAS IN LINE TO THE THRONE OF ENGLAND 
THAT IS SOCIAL CLIMBING 
BY THE LATE MIDDLE AGES 
YOUR PLACE IN SOCIETY WAS NO LONGER DICTATED ENTIRELY BY YOUR BIRTH 
FAMILIES LIKE THE CHAUCERS 
WERE MOVING INTO PLACES ONCE RESERVED FOR THE ARISTOCRACY 
BLOOD AND LAND WERE NO LONGER THE SOLE PATH TO POWER 
SKILL AND AMBITION COULD TAKE YOU TO THE TOP 
BY THE END OF THE MIDDLE AGES 
ENGLAND WAS A VERY DIFFERENT COUNTRY FROM WHAT IT HAD BEEN FIVE HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE 
SLAVERY HAD DISAPPEARED WERGILD MAN PRICE WAS A DISTANT MEMORY 
THE SERFS WERE NOW FREE MEN 
AND THE POWER OF THE KING WAS CHECKED BY LAW AND PARLIAMENT 
A FREE AND EQUAL SOCIETY 
CERTAINLY NOT BUT ONE THAT A KNIGHT FROM FIVE CENTURIES EARLIER 
OR EVEN A SERF ON THAT KNIGHT'S ESTATES 
WOULD SCARCELY HAVE RECOGNISED 
FOR A FREE POSTER FEATURING THE MEDIEVAL LOCATIONS FROM THE SERIES 
AND MORE ABOUT OPEN UNIVERSITY PROGRAMMES 
HALF COMMUNE HALF ROCK BAND 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD CHANGE THE WORLD 
EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITY TO THE GROUP 
WE LIVE TOGETHER BECAUSE WE LOVE EACH OTHER 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THESE TWO SEVERLY AUTISTIC CHILDREN 
HAD PIONEERING THERAPY TO HELP THEM SPEAK 
WHAT DO YOU WANT I WANT APPLE 
THIS POLITICIAN WASN'T TAKING ANY PRISONERS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE 
YOU EITHER BE KILLED BY THEM OR KILL THEM I WANT TO SEE THEM DEAD 
AND IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT FIFTEEN PEOPLE SPENT AN ENTIRE YEAR LIVING IN THE IRON AGE 
BREAKFAST WAS ALMOST ALWAYS A PORRIDGE OF BOILED WHEAT WITH MILK 
AND HONEY IF THERE WAS ANY 
NOW A NEW SERIES CATCHES UP WITH THE CHARACTERS 
FROM SOME OF THE BEST B. B. C. DOCUMENTARIES OF THE LAST FORTY YEARS 
AND FINDS OUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
