OUR JOURNEY STARTS IN SALTASH 
THE GEOGRAPHICAL BORDER SPLIT DEVON AND CORNWALL ACROSS THE BANKS OF THE RIVER TAMAR 
AS THE RAILROADS WERE OPENING UP THE WILD WEST OF AMERICA 
THE SAME THING WAS HAPPENING HERE IN THE WILD WEST OF ENGLAND 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY NINE THE YEAR BILLY THE KID WAS BORN 
BRUNEL THE GREAT RAILWAY PIONEER WAS OPENING UP THE GATEWAY TO CORNWALL 
WITH THIS MAGNIFICENT BRIDGE ACROSS THE TAMAR 
IT WAS A HUGE ENGINEERING FEAT TAKING THIRTEEN YEARS TO COMPLETE 
NO ONE HAD SEEN A BRIDGE LIKE IT 
IT WAS A GLIMPSE OF THE FUTURE 
FOR THE FIRST TIME CORNWALL WAS CONNECTED TO THE MAIN LINE NETWORK 
OVER THE FOLLOWING DECADES IT BROUGHT TRADE AND TOURISM 
OUTSIDERS FLOCKED TO THE NEWLY FASHIONABLE CORNISH RIVIERA 
LOOK AT THIS LOOE FOR IDEAL HOMES AND HOLIDAYS 
CAN'T MISS THAT 
ON THE WAY TO LOOE IT'S CLASSIC CORNWALL ALL THE WAY 
LOOE IS BUILT AROUND ITS HARBOUR AND RIVER ESTUARY AND DIVIDED INTO TWO HALVES 
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE QUINTESSENTIAL PICTURE POSTCARD ON THE GRAND TOUR OF CORNWALL 
IT SAYS HERE IN THIS NINETEEN SIXTIES BROCHURE 
THE NEW VISITOR WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF ARRIVAL 
SEEMS TO BE SUBCONSCIOUSLY ABSORBED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE OF HOLIDAY PEACEFULNESS 
AND ENGLAND SEEMS A THOUSAND MILES AWAY 
ROMANTIC IDYLL IT MAY BE BUT THERE'S MORE TO LOOE THAN TOURIST BROCHURE BANTER 
IT'S CORNWALL'S SECOND LARGEST FISHING PORT 
AND ACCORDING TO TOP CHEF RICK STEIN LANDS SOME OF THE FRESHEST FISH IN THE U. K. 
DOVERS AND MONK MIX 
THIS IS LOOE FISH AUCTION 
WE'RE ON THE SKATES FIRST LOT HERE WE GO 
IT'S A HIGHLY CHARGED ATMOSPHERE USING THE LATEST AUCTIONEERING TECHNOLOGY 
WITH BUYERS FROM ALL OVER BRITAIN VYING FOR TODAY'S CATCH 
QUALITY DOESN'T COME CHEAP 
TODAY THE MOST EXPENSIVE ONE I'VE BOUGHT IS EXTRA LARGE TURBOT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOR ONE FISH 
WOW IS THAT A TYPICAL PRICE IN HERE IT CAN GO HIGHER THAN THAT FOR TURBOT 
BUT WHY DO YOU COME TO THIS MARKET IS IT A GOOD ONE 
PURELY FOR QUALITY REALLY WE BUY IN SEVERAL OTHER PORTS 
NEWLYN BRIXHAM AND PLYMOUTH BUT THIS ONE IS THE BEST FOR QUALITY 
THEY GO OUT IN THE MORNING THEY LAND IN THE EVENING WE'RE BUYING IT 
AND IT'S ON THE COUNTER WITHIN TWELVE HOURS 
THIS MARKET'S ONE OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE IN THE U. K. 
AND ITS SUCCESS IS DOWN TO THE FACT THAT BOATS ONLY GO OUT FOR A DAY 
DAY BOAT FISHING 
AT OTHER PORTS THE BIGGER BOATS CAN BE OUT UP TO A WEEK 
THE FRESHNESS JUST CAN'T COMPLETE WITH THE QUICK TURNAROUND OF LOOE 
IT MAY BE AN ACCIDENT OF NATURE BUT IT'S CREATED A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY 
THE PORT IS SO SMALL AND THE HARBOUR SO SHALLOW 
IT CAN ONLY TAKE DAY BOATS 
SO IT'S THE LIMITATIONS OF THE HARBOUR THAT HAVE CREATED LOOE'S GREATEST ASSET SUPER FRESH FISH 
SO HOW WOULD I SPOT THAT THIS IS TRULY FRESH FISH 
WELL LOOK AT THE HADDOCK I MEAN HOW STIFF IS THAT LOOK 
SLIMY RIGHT SO SLIME'S A GOOD SIGN SLIME'S A GOOD SIGN UH HUH 
SO IF IT'S REALLY FLOPPY DOES THAT MEAN IT'S 
YEAH UNLESS IT'S PRE RIGOR MORTIS 
WHICH PROBABLY TAKES TO BECOME RIGOR MORTIS MAYBE FIVE TO SIX HOURS 
AFTER IT'S CAUGHT AND THEN FROM STIFF TO REALLY FLOPPY'S NOT GOOD 
THE HERRING PEOPLE BUY THEM WHEN THE EYES ARE ALL RED 
WELL IT TAKES A DAY OR SO TO BECOME RED 
I MEAN LOOK AT THE MACKEREL 
LINE CAUGHT YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL 
BY THE DAMAGE AROUND THE MOUTH 
RIGHT O. K. WHY IS LINE CAUGHT BETTER THAN SOMETHING OUT OF A NET 
FISH IS LESS STRESSED AND FISH DOESN'T DROWN SO IT MAKES THE MEAT FAR SUPERIOR 
THE GILLS ARE LOVELY AND RED AND CLEAR 
RIGHT SO THERE'S STILL OXYGENATED BLOOD NEAR THEM YEAH 
YOU SOUND AS IF YOU LOVE THESE THINGS OH IT'S A PASSION 
AFTER THE FISH HAS BEEN AUCTIONED TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER 
THE NEXT STAGE IS DISTRIBUTION 
STEVE FARRAR IS A FISH MERCHANT AND MIDDLE MAN BUT TRYING TO GET A MOMENT WITH HIM ISN'T EASY 
NO WE HAVEN'T RICHARD NO WE'VE GOT NO BRILL 
THERE'S SOME NICE TURBOT I'VE A LARGE TURBOT AND MONK D'YOU WANT ANY MONK 
NINETY PER CENT OF THE FISH IN LOOE ENDS UP GOING ABROAD 
I WANT TO KNOW WHY 
WHY IS SO MUCH OF IT BEING EXPORTED 
THE FISHING INDUSTRY'S SIMPLE IT'S A QUESTION OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND 
YOU'VE GOT TO SEND IT WHERE THE BEST PRICE IS 
OR YOU'RE OUT OF THE GAME 
SO THE CONTINENT IS PREPARED TO SPEND MORE 
FOR THE FISH THAT WE DON'T GENERALLY SEE 
YEAH FOR FISH YOU DON'T GENERALLY SEE IN THE SHOPS QUITE OFTEN IT'S BECAUSE IT'S GONE ABROAD 
CUTTLEFISH SQUID TURBOT THIS IS QUALITY FISH AND WE'RE LETTING IT GET AWAY 
NEXT TIME YOU GO AWAY TO FOREIGN PARTS REMEMBER 
YOU AND THAT FISH ARE PROBABLY BOTH ON HOLIDAY 
LET'S FACE IT UNLESS YOU LIVE HERE IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET TO CORNWALL 
WHICH IS WHY THERE'S OFTEN THE VIEW THAT IT'S ISOLATED AND REMOTE 
BUT THAT DEPENDS ON YOUR POINT OF VIEW 
WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO FALMOUTH 
WHOSE ASSOCIATION WITH THE SEA 
MADE IT MORE COSMOPOLITAN THAN LONDON IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
FALMOUTH HAS BEEN A MAJOR COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY PORT SINCE THE SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS 
BUT IT WASN'T JUST A TRADE HUB 
WITH TWENTY FIVE FOREIGN CONSULATES 
AND NATIONALITIES FROM AROUND THE GLOBE ARRIVING DAILY 
IT WAS AN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATION CENTRE 
THIS IS WHERE THE UNBEARABLE NEWS OF NELSON'S DEATH REACHED ENGLAND 
THEY HEARD IT HERE FIRST 
TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO FALMOUTH WAS THE PLACE TO BE 
BUT WHY FALMOUTH 
BY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETY YEARS OF WAR WITH FRANCE HAD MADE GETTING NEWS AND SUPPLIES IN AND OUT OF BRITAIN DIFFICULT 
FALMOUTH UNLIKE DOVER AND HARWICH 
WAS FAR ENOUGH FROM THE FRENCH COAST 
TO MAKE IT SAFE FROM THEIR INTERFERENCE 
BUT SHIPS WERE STILL VULNERABLE OUT AT SEA 
THE SOLUTION WAS THE PACKET SHIP 
LIGHTLY ARMED BRIGS DESIGNED BY THE ROYAL MAIL 
THEY WERE SMALL BUT THEY WERE FAST 
CRUCIALLY THEY COULD OUTRUN THE NOTORIOUS FRENCH PRIVATEERS 
FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS GOVERNMENT MAIL BULLION 
AND V. I. P.'S FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE GLOBE 
WERE PICKED UP FROM AND DROPPED OFF IN FALMOUTH 
THE SHAPE OF THE PORT MAY NOT HAVE CHANGED MUCH 
BUT AT THE TIME IT WAS A MELTING POT OF SHIPPING AGENTS ADVENTURERS 
MERCHANTS AND REFUGEES IT WAS THE MAIN LINK TO THE EMPIRE 
IT WASN'T UNHEARD OF FOR NEWS TO HIT THE LOCAL PAPER HERE 
BEFORE IT WAS RUSHED UP THE ROAD WHAT'S NOW THE A THIRTY TO LONDON 
THE HEADLINE MIGHT NOT BE ABSOLUTELY GENUINE 
BUT THE PAPER REALLY IS THE FALMOUTH PACKET 
IT WAS THE SEA THAT BROUGHT PROSPERITY TO FALMOUTH 
FISH FOR THE TABLE EXOTIC IMPORTS FROM ABROAD 
BUT THIS CAME AT A PRICE 
THE COASTLINE IS LITTERED WITH THOUSANDS OF WRECKS 
THE MANACLES JUST OFF THE LIZARD WITH ITS SUBMERGED ROCKS 
HAS CAUGHT OUT EVEN THE SALTIEST SEA DOGS 
YOU MIGHT NOT SPOT IT AT FIRST GLANCE 
BUT ON THE HORIZON THERE'S A MARKER 
A SPIRE THAT HAS COME TO THE RESCUE OF MANY A SAILOR 
MIRANDA KRESTOVNIKOFF TAKES A CLOSER LOOK 
THERE'S BEEN A CHURCH HERE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS 
AN IMPORTANT LANDMARK FOR SAILORS TRYING TO NAVIGATE A COURSE 
THROUGH THOSE NOTORIOUS ROCKS DOWN THERE 
IN FACT THE CHURCH HAS GIVEN ITS NAME TO THE INFAMOUS ROCKS BELOW 
THE MANACLES REEF GETS ITS NAME FROM THE CORNISH MAEN EGLOS 
MEANING CHURCH STONES 
UNFORTUNATELY EVEN THIS DIVINE LANDMARK 
COULDN'T KEEP EVERY PASSING BOAT SAFE 
THIS GRAVEYARD ALONE HOUSES OVER THREE HUNDRED VICTIMS OF SHIPWRECKS 
MANY OF THE LOST SOULS BURIED HERE 
COME FROM JUST A SINGLE TRAGEDY 
THE SINKING OF A LARGE PASSENGER AND CARGO SHIP THAT WAS ON HER WAY TO AMERICA IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT 
IT WAS CALLED THE MOHEGAN 
THIS MEMORIAL STONE MARKS THE SPOT 
WHERE MANY VICTIMS OF THE MOHEGAN WRECK WERE PUT TO REST IN ONE MASS GRAVE 
A WRECK IS A HUMAN TRAGEDY AND NATURE SHOWS NO MERCY 
BUT WHAT SHE TAKES WITH ONE HAND SHE GIVES WITH ANOTHER 
THE LOST SHIP IS SLOWLY TRANSFORMED INTO A NEW PIECE OF THE CORNISH COAST 
PAUL NAYLOR MARINE BIOLOGIST AND UNDERWATER PHOTOGRAPHER 
HAS BEEN EXPLORING THE REMAINS OF BOATS LIKE THE MOHEGAN FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS 
NOW THE SITE THAT WE'RE DIVING IS A REALLY POPULAR SITE IN THE U. K. 
WHAT MAKES THE WRECK OF THE MOHEGAN SO SPECIAL 
THE MANACLES ARE SPECIAL ANYWAY COS THE CURRENTS BRING IN ALL THE FOOD 
FOR A WEALTH OF ANIMALS 
AND THE MOHEGAN WRECK GIVES EVEN MORE HABITAT FOR THE ANIMALS TO LIVE IN AND LIVE ON AND ATTACH TO 
SO IT'S JUST FANTASTIC LIFE 
THE VAST AMOUNTS OF PLANKTON HERE FORM THE BASIS OF THE FOOD CHAIN 
SUSTAINING MANY SPECIES AND GIVING THE WATER ITS DISTINCTIVE GREEN COLOUR 
OVER THE LAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS THE COMBINATION OF PASSING TIME AND STRONG CURRENTS 
HAS STRIPPED THE BOAT BARE 
ALL THAT REMAINS ARE THE LARGE RUSTING METAL PLATES WHICH FORMED THE BASIC STRUCTURE 
THERE'S SO MUCH WRECKAGE LYING AROUND 
IT'S A BIG WRECK LOOK AT THOSE HUGE BOILERS 
THE SHIP IS NOW COVERED WITH DEAD MEN'S FINGERS 
A RATHER MORBID NAME FOR AN EERIE REMINDER OF THE BOAT'S FATE 
HUNDREDS OF LITTLE INDIVIDUAL POLYPS MAKE UP THE COLONY OF THE DEAD MEN'S FINGERS 
AND THEY HAVE THIS SORT OF GELATINOUS SKELETON INSTEAD OF THE HARD STONY SKELETON OF REEF CORALS 
THEY'RE REALLY PRETTY WITH ALL THEIR TENTACLES OUT THEY LOOK REALLY FEATHERY 
SOFT CORALS LIKE THESE 
ARE AMONGST THE FIRST LONG TERM SETTLERS ON A WRECK 
ALL THESE LITTLE NOOKS AND CRANNIES 
EVERY ONE HAS GOT SOMETHING LIVING IN IT 
IT'S LIKE THE POSH COFFEE SHOP EFFECT ONCE THE SPONGES SOFT CORALS AND ANENOMES MOVE IN 
YOU KNOW THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IS BEING GENTRIFIED 
THE INITIAL PIONEERS LIKE KEELWORMS WHO PAVE THE WAY FOR THESE MORE COLOURFUL INHABITANTS 
ARE SOON LOST IN THE FOREST OF FAST GROWING ALGAE 
AND ALL THAT'S NEEDED FOR THE UNDERWATER CITY TO START GROWING 
IS A LITTLE RUST OR A SCRATCHED SURFACE FOR THE DIFFERENT COLONISERS TO ATTACH THEMSELVES TO 
OH LOOK SEA FANS 
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL 
THE PINK SEA FAN IS A PROTECTED SPECIES 
IT GROWS AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE CURRENT 
SO THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL POLYP THAT MAKES UP THE COLONY 
HAS THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL TO CATCH FOOD 
THESE HUGE SEA FANS ON THE MOHEGAN SHOW THE WRECK'S AGE 
THESE CORALS CAN ONLY GROW A CENTIMETRE A YEAR 
SO SOME OF THESE COLONIES ARE OVER FIFTY YEARS OLD 
AS WE MOVE AWAY FROM THE WRECK OTHER SPECIES START MAKING AN APPEARANCE 
THE ROCKS ARE LIKE THE OLD HISTORIC HEART OF A TOWN 
THIS IS WHERE YOU FIND RESIDENTS THAT HAVE LIVED HERE FOREVER 
JEWEL ANENOMES PRODUCE DOZENS OF LITTLE CLONES OF THEMSELVES 
CREATING DISTINCT BLOCKS OF COLOUR 
I'VE FOUND A CRAB YOU CAN SEE ITS MOUTH PARTS GOING 
I REMEMBER MY FIRST DIVE SOMEBODY PUT ONE OF THOSE ON MY HEAD I WAS A BIT SCARED 
DIVERS IN THE MANACLES ATTACH GREAT MYSTIQUE TO THE WRECKS HERE 
IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY NATURE HAS ADOPTED AND THEN ADAPTED THEM 
TO BECOME AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE UNDERWATER LANDSCAPE 
IT'S CORNWALL AT ITS NATURAL BEST
