HELLO I'M JEREMY VINE AND WELCOME TO PANORAMA 
FROM THE FIRST TIME WE REPORT FROM INSIDE HAUT DE LA GARENNE 
AS JERSEY'S CHILDREN'S HOMES BEGIN TO GIVE UP THEIR SECRETS 
WITH THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE THAT'S COMING FORWARD 
I'M CONVINCED THAT WE WILL GET CONVICTIONS 
WE'VE DRILLED BORE HOLES IT RELEASES AROMAS THAT ARE DOWN THERE 
AND THERE HAS BEEN AN INDICATION UP IN THIS CORNER 
WE HEAR FROM THOSE DRAGGED FROM THEIR BEDS TO SUFFER AN ORDEAL IN THE DARK 
I OFTEN HEARD 
OTHER BOYS SCREAMING 
SO THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON 
IN ANOTHER PART OF THE CELLAR 
AND TRACKED DOWN THE CARE STAFF FROM OTHER HOMES 
WHO TRIED TO ESCAPE THEIR PAST 
SIX WEEKS AGO POLICE IN JERSEY STARTED THE GRIMMEST OF WORK 
DIGGING UP THE CELLARS IN A CHILDREN'S HOME 
IT WAS IN RESPONSE TO ACCOUNTS BY FORMER RESIDENTS 
THAT THEY'D BEEN LOCKED UP MISTREATED AND ABUSED THERE 
THE MEDIA ATTENTION HAS NOT BEEN WELCOMED ON THE ISLAND 
FAMOUS AS A TAX HAVEN WITH A LONG HISTORY OF DISCRETION AND SECRECY 
PANORAMA ASKS IF THAT HAS LED TO VICTIMS' ALLEGATIONS BEING IGNORED 
AND THOSE UNDER SUSPICION ESCAPING PUNISHMENT 
BACK IN THE SEVENTIES I TOOK MY FIRST JOB AS A JOURNALIST 
HERE IN THE CHANNEL ISLANDS 
ALTHOUGH WE KNEW OF A CHILDREN'S HOME IN THE EAST OF JERSEY 
IT WAS SELDOM MENTIONED 
AND THERE WAS NO REASON TO SUSPECT ANYTHING WAS WRONG 
MY PATCH WAS MORE ABOUT POTATOES LOCAL POLITICS AND TOURISM 
IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE ISLAND QUICKLY 
AND YOU AREN'T LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET A HIRE CAR 
YOU'LL PROBABLY USE ONE OF THE ISLAND'S BLUE AND WHITE BUSES 
HAUT DE LA GARENNE JUST WASN'T ON THE RADAR 
BUT THAT ALL CHANGED IN NOVEMBER 
WHEN THE POLICE REVEALED THEY WERE DIGGING BENEATH THE BUILDING 
I CAME BACK THAT DAY 
AND WAS THE FIRST NATIONAL JOURNALIST TO REPORT ON THE NEWS 
THAT HUMAN REMAINS HAD BEEN UNCOVERED 
THE HOME OPENED ONE HUNDRED FORTY YEARS AGO AS THE JERSEY INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL 
FOR WHAT WERE TERMED YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE LOWER CLASSES 
AND NEGLECTED CHILDREN 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY THE NAME CHANGED TO HAUT DE LA GARENNE 
THE BUILDING HOUSED SIXTY BOYS AND GIRLS FROM TODDLERS TO TEENAGERS 
A MIX OF VULNERABLE KIDS AND THOSE IN TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE 
THE REGIME WAS TOUGH BUT SOME STAFF 
POSED A MORE SINISTER THREAT TO THE YOUNG RESIDENTS 
HE WOULD COME INTO THE DORMITORY 
ER 
PULL ME OUT OF BED O'CONNELL COME WITH ME 
AND DRAG ME ALONG BY MY HAIR 
OR PULL ME BY THE EARS 
AND ER 
FROGMARCH ME OFF 
STRIP ME AND DUMP ME IN A BATH 
AND ERM SEXUALLY ABUSE ME 
AND ER 
WHEN HE WAS SATISFIED WHEN HE HAD SATISFIED HIMSELF 
HE WOULD WANDER OFF AND LEAVE YOU THERE 
LEAVE YOU IN THE DARK LEAVE YOU IN THE DARK YEAH 
ER TRAUMATISED AND TERRIFIED 
I OFTEN HEARD 
OTHER BOYS SCREAMING 
SO THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON 
IN ANOTHER PART OF THE CELLAR 
KEVIN O'CONNELL THEN TWELVE WAS PLACED AT THE HOME WITH HIS TWO BROTHERS 
ON OCCASIONS THE ABUSE LASTED FOR DAYS 
WHEN HE CAME BACK LATER ON IN THE AFTERNOON OR EVENING 
AND SEXUALLY ABUSE YOU 
AGAIN SATISFY HIMSELF 
AND GO OFF 
AND OF COURSE I'D BE SOBBING AND CRYING AND 
GOD KNOWS WHAT ELSE 
SAME THING ON THE SUNDAY 
AND THEN SOME TIME ON THE SUNDAY AFTERNOON EVENING 
HE WOULD COME AND 
KISS AND CUDDLE YOU AS THOUGH NOTHING HAD HAPPENED 
HAUT DE LA GARENNE CAME TO THE ATTENTION OF POLICE 
AFTER DISTURBING DETAILS EMERGED DURING COURT CASES 
INVOLVING STAFF FROM THE JERSEY SEA CADETS 
CLIPPINGS IN THE ISLAND'S LIBRARY SHOW THAT BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND TWO THOUSAND TWO 
THREE PEOPLE WERE FOUND GUILTY OF SEXUAL OFFENCES AGAINST CHILDREN 
EVIDENCE GATHERED AT THAT TIME WOULD EVENTUALLY LEAD TO THE DOORS 
OF HAUT DE LA GARENNE 
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX ERM WE BECAME CONCERNED ABOUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
IN POSITIONS WHERE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE CARING FOR CHILDREN 
WHO WERE ACTUALLY BEING ACCUSED OF ABUSING THEM 
WE BECAME ER INTERESTED IN HAUT DE LA GARENNE 
PEOPLE WERE SAYING THEY WERE ABUSED THERE 
OR THAT THEY HAD FRIENDS WHO WERE ABUSED THERE 
AND WE THEN TOOK THE DECISION AT THAT STAGE 
TO MOUNT AN INQUIRY WHICH WAS STILL COVERT AT THAT TIME 
LENNY HARPER ARRIVED ON JERSEY SIX YEARS AGO 
HE'S A WIDELY EXPERIENCED DETECTIVE 
WHO PREVIOUSLY SERVED IN THE ROYAL ULSTER CONSTABULARY AND THE MET 
CAN I JUST ASK HOW DEEP BENEATH THE GROUND AT THE GRASS LEVEL 
HE'S BEEN THE PUBLIC FACE OF THIS INVESTIGATION 
WE'RE IN THERE NOW AND WE'VE HAD A QUICK LOOK 
AND AS I SAY WE'VE HAD AN INDICATION FROM THE DOG 
POLICE ARE LOOKING AT SEVEN SITES IN THE HOME AND ITS GROUNDS 
PARTIAL FRAGMENTS OF A SKULL 
HAVE BEEN FOUND NEAR THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING 
AS YET NO MORE REMAINS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED 
EXPERTS ARE NOW CONCENTRATING THEIR EFFORTS 
ON WORKING THROUGH A SERIES OF FOUR CELLARS 
WHICH UNTIL RECENTLY HAD BEEN COMPLETELY BRICKED UP 
MORNING MORNING 
PANORAMA'S BEEN GIVEN EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO THE POLICE INQUIRY 
I JOINED LENNY HARPER AT HIS DAILY BRIEFING 
VICKY FORENSIC 
YEP SURE ELAINE FINISHED HER TAPING YESTERDAY 
OF CELLAR TWO SO SHE'S GONNA BE STARTING TO MOVE ON TO 
CLEARING THE RUBBLE OFF THE FLOOR IT'LL TAKE QUITE A WHILE 
THERE'S A LOT OF DEBRIS DOWN THERE AND ONCE THAT'S DONE 
WE CAN DO THE BLOOD SCREENING 
JERSEY POLICE KEPT THEIR INVESTIGATION SECRET FOR A YEAR 
THEIR DECISION TO GO PUBLIC BROUGHT A FLOOD OF INFORMATION 
FROM ALLEGED VICTIMS INFORMATION THAT LED DETECTIVES 
TO THIS CRAMPED UNDER FLOOR AREA BENEATH HAUT DE LA GARENNE 
THIS IS WHAT'S BEEN REFERRED TO AS CELLAR ONE 
AND BELOW ME IS THE STONE TROUGH 
IN WHICH WERE FOUND MINUTE TRACES OF WHAT POLICE THINK IS HUMAN BLOOD 
BEYOND ME THE TEAM FOUND A SET OF METAL SHACKLES 
PERHAPS ONCE FASTENED TO THE WALL THEY TOO ARE BEING TESTED FOR D. N. A. 
THIS IS JERSEY'S LARGEST EVER INVESTIGATION 
AT TIMES THE IMAGES FROM HAUT DE LA GARENNE 
ARE MORE LIKE AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIG THAN A CRIME SCENE 
IT'S WORK THAT WOULD OVERWHELM THE ISLAND FORCE 
WERE IT NOT FOR THE U. K. EXPERTS NOW HELPING TO TAKE THE BUILDING APART 
DRILLING BENEATH FOUNDATIONS CUTTING AWAY FLOORS 
EXCAVATING NEARBY FIELDS 
EVERY SPADE FULL EVERY BARROW LOAD MUST BE EXAMINED IN DETAIL 
IF THERE ARE SECRETS HERE 
NO ONE CAN AFFORD TO MISS THEM 
VICKY COUPLAND THE CRIME SCENE MANAGER 
FACES SEVERAL MORE WEEKS OF PAINSTAKING SEARCHES 
THIS DOORWAY HERE LEADS IN TO WHAT WE'RE CALLING CELLAR ONE 
THE FIRST ROOM THAT WE UNCOVERED 
THAT'S BEEN PRETTY MUCH PROCESSED NOW AND WE'RE COMPLETE WITH THAT 
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT YOUR WAY FORWARD 
THERE'S A CONNECTION ROOM DOWN HERE WHICH WE'VE BEEN CALLING CELLAR TWO 
WHICH IS THE ROOM YOU SEE HERE IT'S VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS 
SO EVERYTHING'S GOT TO BE BAGGED LABELLED CATALOGUED 
AND THAT'S THAT POINT THAT YOU CAN PUT THE DOGS IN 
AND THE FORENSIC TEAMS IN TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT IT YEAH 
THE FORENSIC TEAMS ARE DEALING WITH THE RECOVERY OF EVIDENCE 
AND THEN WE'LL LOOK TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY BLOOD STAINS 
WE WERE THE FIRST JOURNALISTS TO BE ALLOWED IN 
SHORTLY AFTER CELLAR TWO WAS OPENED UP 
ALLEGED VICTIMS HAVE SPOKEN OF A TRAP DOOR INTO THIS ROOM 
OF A WOODEN BENCH SOMEWHERE AMONGST THE DUST AND RUBBLE 
MAY LIE FURTHER CLUES 
WE'VE TAKEN THE BENCH OUT TO PRESERVE ANY EVIDENCE ON IT 
THAT'LL BE SCREENED ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE CELLAR 
WE'LL THEN DUST OFF THE SURFACE DUST 
AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING UNDERNEATH ANY FURTHER HAIRS 
AND WE CAN FINGERPRINT IT AS WELL THE SAME WAY AS THE FLOORBOARDS 
THIS IS A HUGE AND COMPLEX TASK ANY INQUIRY STRETCHING BACK DECADES 
MEANS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO CORROBORATE EVIDENCE 
WITNESSES ARE FRAGILE VICTIMS ARE NATURALLY RELUCTANT 
TO RELIVE PAINFUL MEMORIES 
RECORDS HAVE PROVED SKETCHY OR NON EXISTENT 
AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE POLICE MIGHT WANT TO TALK TO 
HAVE SINCE DIED THAT'S WHY IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL 
THAT THE FORENSIC TEAMS RECOVER EVERY SCRAP OF INFORMATION 
THAT MIGHT SUPPORT ACCOUNTS OF WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO CHILDREN 
HERE AT HAUT DE LA GARENNE 
BUT IT WOULD APPEAR THAT JERSEY WASN'T ALWAYS AS THOROUGH 
IN GATHERING VITAL EVIDENCE ON WHAT WENT ON IN ITS CHILDREN'S HOMES 
PAUL MOED WAS JUST EIGHTEEN WHEN HE GOT A JOB AS A JUNIOR HOUSE PARENT 
AT HAUT DE LA GARENNE IN THE MID SIXTIES 
SPEAKING PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST TIME HE HAS VIVID MEMORIES 
OF THE THREAT POSED BY THE THEN HEADMASTER COLIN TILBROOK 
TO THOSE UNDER HIS CARE 
I SAW HIM IN THE DORMITORY ONE EVENING 
WALKING WITH A PILLOW UNDER HIS ARM 
I ASKED A COLLEAGUE WHO HE WAS AND WHAT HE WAS DOING 
HE CARRIES THE PILLOW ROUND SO YOU CAN'T HEAR THE GIRLS SCREAM 
I SAID I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU JUST SAID THAT 
HE'S GOT ONE OF OUR GIRLS PREGNANT A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD 
WE HAD TO TAKE HER FOR AN ABORTION 
SHOCKED BY APPARENT ACCEPTANCE OF THE THREAT TO CHILDREN 
PAUL SAYS HE IMMEDIATELY REPORTED WHAT HE'D SEEN TO THE POLICE 
I WAS TOLD IN PLAIN ENGLISH WE WILL LOOK INTO IT 
BUT DON'T SAY ANYTHING TO ANYBODY IT WILL AFFECT YOUR LIFE IN JERSEY 
YOUR FAMILY WILL BE EMBARRASSED AND IT'LL MAKE LIFE VERY DIFFICULT 
NO RECORDS EXIST OF THAT INTERVIEW 
BUT PAUL HAS SINCE MADE A FORMAL STATEMENT TO LENNY HARPER'S TEAM 
KEVIN O'CONNELL HAS ALSO BEEN INTERVIEWED 
HE BELIEVES THE TRAUMA CAUSED HIS BROTHER TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE 
THE FACT THAT MICHAEL EXPERIENCED 
EXACTLY THE SAME AS WHAT I WENT THROUGH 
I BELIEVE IT JUST GOT TOO MUCH FOR HIM 
AND HE ENDED UP HANGING HIMSELF 
I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT WAS BECAUSE OF THE ABUSE THE SEXUAL ABUSE 
HE WAS ONLY FOURTEEN 
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE LEFT JERSEY 
PAUL WENT BACK TO THE HOME WITH ME 
LIKE KEVIN HE'S ANGRY IT HAS TAKEN SO LONG FOR THE TRUTH TO EMERGE 
THINGS MUST HAVE BEEN KNOWN WE TALKED ABOUT IT 
I COMPLAINED OTHERS COMPLAINED 
FOR SOME REASON THEY NEVER TOOK ANY ACTION THAT'S JUST WRONG 
IT'S TRUE TO SAY WE HAVE VICTIMS' STATEMENTS 
WHO SAY THEY DID TRY AND REPORT MATTERS 
SOME OF THEM WERE TAKEN UP AND FOLLOWED SOME WAY ALONG THE ROAD 
AND SOME OF THEM WOULD APPEAR NOT TO HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH PROPERLY 
THAT'S CERTAINLY THE INFORMATION WE HAVE 
WHEN WE HAVE DEALT WITH THE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE 
BOTH PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL THEN WE'LL TURN OUR ATTENTION 
TO SUGGESTIONS THAT MATTERS WEREN'T DEALT WITH 
IF THERE ARE CRIMINAL IMPLICATIONS THAT WILL BE DEALT WITH AS WELL 
JERSEY IS JUST NINE MILES BY FIVE 
MORE FRENCH THAN BRITISH AN ISLAND WHERE THERE'S NO PARTY POLITICS 
WHERE THE U. K. SELDOM INTERVENES 
WHERE THE CHIEF JUDGE AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ARE BROTHERS 
JERSEY IS USED TO DEALING WITH ITS OWN PROBLEMS 
BUT NOW THE WORLD WANTS TO KNOW WHO KNEW WHAT AND WHEN 
WE'LL SPEAK TO TWO POLITICIANS NOW 
ONE IS SENATOR STUART SYVRET THE FORMER HEALTH MINISTER 
WHO SAYS HE WAS SACKED FOR BLOWING THE WHISTLE ON ALL THIS 
WE KNOW THIS HAS TAKEN PLACE OVER ALL THOSE DECADES 
HE IS DISTORTING THE TRUTH 
I'M THE FIRST POLITICIAN TO TRY TO RIP THE LID OFF IT 
HE'S ONE DISAFFECTED PERSON HE BLEW THE WHISTLE 
WHEN THIS DEBATE STOPPED THE REAL CONVERSATION STARTED 
BECAUSE OF HIS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE CONDUCT 
FRANK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DEAD CHILDREN 
EXACTLY 
YOU SHOULD NOW BE THROWING YOUR SUPPORT BEHIND THE POLICE 
AND BEHIND EVERY EFFORT TO FIND 
I HAVE NO YOU'RE TRYING TO SHOW UP JERSEY INTERNATIONALLY 
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A COVER UP WITHIN THE HOME ITSELF 
THERE IS NO PROOF AT THIS JUNCTURE THAT THE COVER UP WENT ANY FURTHER 
BUT IF IT DID 
IT WILL BE INVESTIGATED AND THOSE PEOPLE CONCERNED 
WHO LET CHILDREN DOWN BY COVERING IT UP OR NOT DOING THEIR JOB PROPERLY 
WILL ALSO BE INVESTIGATED AND BROUGHT TO ACCOUNT 
THE SYSTEM IN JERSEY HAS FAILED CATASTROPHICALLY 
THE MAN WHO CRIED COVER UP SAYS JERSEY 
CAN NO LONGER INVESTIGATE ITSELF 
THE INSTINCTIVE IMMEDIATE REACTION OF THE JERSEY ESTABLISHMENT 
TO ANY CONTROVERSY IS TO TRY AND SILENCE IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW THESE PEOPLE CAN EFFECTIVELY REGULATE 
POLICE EACH OTHER MAYBE EVEN SACK PEOPLE 
IF THEY ARE YOUR BRIDGE PARTNER OR SOMETHING 
SOMETHING IS WRONG WHEN THERE ARE SENIOR LEADERS IN THE ISLAND 
WHO WANT TO GLOSS OVER THE EVENTS 
AND CONTINUE TO PROMOTE THE POSITIVE IMAGE OF THE ISLAND 
WHEN ISLANDERS GATHERED AT THIS RALLY 
SUPPORT FOR THEIR GOVERNMENT WAS DILUTED 
BY THOSE WHO AGREE THAT IT'S TIME TO QUESTION 
THE JERSEY WAY OF DOING THINGS 
WHAT EVERYONE HERE FEARS IS THAT THE NEWS WILL GET WORSE 
AND WITH GOOD REASON 
THE ALLEGATIONS DIDN'T STOP AT HAUT DE LA GARENNE 
WHEN IT CLOSED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE CHILDREN IN ITS CARE 
WERE TRANSFERRED TO SMALLER FAMILY UNITS WITH HOUSE PARENTS 
BACK THEN THIS WAS ONE OF THEM IT WAS CALLED BLANCHE PIERRE 
TRAGICALLY THE NEW REGIME DID NOT MEAN AN END TO THE ABUSE 
THE HOUSE PARENTS JANE AND ALAN MAGUIRE 
IN THE WORDS OF AN OFFICIAL REPORT 
SUBJECTED CHILDREN TO GROSS ACTS OF PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE 
DARREN PICOT WHO NOW LIVES WITH HIS FAMILY IN CORNWALL 
RECALLS ONE INJURY HE SAYS WAS CAUSED BY JANE MAGUIRE'S CRUELTY 
I'D DONE SOMETHING WRONG AS APPARENTLY I ALWAYS DID 
SHE CHASED ME THROUGH THE HOUSE I FELL ONTO A CHAIR 
MY ARM WAS ON THE ARM OF THE CHAIR 
SHE CAME ALONG AND PUSHED DOWN AND IT SNAPPED 
THEN SHE COVERED IT UP BY SAYING IT WAS ME JUST FALLING ONTO THE CHAIR 
JANE MAGUIRE HAD PREVIOUSLY WORKED AT HAUT DE LA GARENNE 
THE BUILDING WHICH HOUSED BLANCHE PIERRE IS SCHEDULED FOR DEMOLITION 
BUT FOR TEN YEARS HELPED BY HER HUSBAND 
MRS. MAGUIRE OPENED ITS DOOR TO TROUBLED VULNERABLE CHILDREN 
MY MUM WAS ILL WITH CANCER AND WE WERE PUT IN TEMPORARY FOSTER CARE 
THEN WE WERE MOVED TO BLANCHE PIERRE HOW OLD WERE YOU FIVE 
ME AND MY SISTER WOULD ALWAYS ARGUE OVER PETTY LITTLE THINGS 
END UP IN LITTLE SQUABBLES FROM IT 
IF WE ER JUST HAD A LITTLE SHARP TONGUE 
WE HAD SOAP RAMMED DOWN OUR THROAT 
IT WOULD BE GRATED ALONG THE BACK OF YOUR TEETH 
HIS NAILS WOULD BE ALL AGAINST THE TOP OF THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH 
THEY PUT DETTOL IN MY MOUTH IT WENT DOWN MY THROAT 
IT BURNED MY THROAT I WAS IN SEVERE PAIN I WAS SCREAMING 
MY THROAT SWELLED UP I COULD NOT BREATHE I WAS BURNING 
BECAUSE IT'S UNDILUTED DETTOL IN MY MOUTH AND MY THROAT 
DIDN'T EVEN TAKE ME TO THE DOCTORS 
IT'S NOT JUST THE CHILDREN THAT REMEMBER THE MAGUIRES 
THEIR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOUR WITNESSED THE BRUTAL REGIME 
AND THE TREATMENT DISHED OUT TO DARREN PICOT IN PARTICULAR 
DARREN WAS PUT IN THE CORNER OF THE PLAYROOM AND LEFT THERE 
TO STAND SOMETIMES ALL DAY IN A CORNER 
I WOULD BE BY MY KITCHEN AND MY WINDOW LOOKS INTO THE PLAYROOM 
HE'D BE STOOD THERE CRYING A BEAUTIFUL LOOKING CHILD CRYING 
IT USED TO MAKE ME CRY 
HE USED TO BE HIT WITH WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A STICK 
ALAN MAGUIRE WAS THE ONE WHO INFLICTED THE PUNISHMENT 
JANE JUST STOOD BY AND WATCHED IT HAPPEN 
IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO MEMBERS OF STAFF 
COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS BEHAVIOUR TO THE AUTHORITIES WHO TOOK ACTION 
AFTER A FASHION THEY WERE ALLOWED TO RETIRE FROM BLANCHE PIERRE 
THEY WERE EVEN SENT A LETTER FROM THE EDUCATION AUTHORITY 
THANKING THEM FOR THEIR ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT COMMITMENT AND HARD WORK 
THE PROOF OF WHICH SAYS THE LETTER 
LIVES ON IN THE CHILDREN FOR WHOM YOU'VE SHOWN MUCH LOVE AND CARE 
JANE MAGUIRE WAS THEN ALLOWED TO TAKE UP A NEW JOB 
WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITY WHICH MEANT THAT SHE CONTINUED TO WORK 
WITH CHILDREN AND DISADVANTAGED ADULTS 
THAT DECISION WAS MADE BY ANTON SKINNER 
HEAD OF CHILDREN'S SERVICES 
AND HE STUCK TO IT IN THE FACE OF OPPOSITION FROM OTHER TEAM MEMBERS 
IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THE MAGUIRES CAME TO THE ATTENTION OF THE POLICE 
FORMER STAFF AND RESIDENTS GAVE STATEMENTS TO DETECTIVES 
WHO THOUGHT THEY HAD A CASE 
IN COURT ALAN MAGUIRE COLLAPSED HE SAID HE WAS TERMINALLY ILL 
THE MAGISTRATE DECIDED THE COUPLE SHOULD STAND TRIAL 
BUT THE CASE WAS ABANDONED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
WHO BLAMED INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE 
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO THROUGH WITH IT IN THE FIRST PLACE 
I MANAGED TO BUILD UP THE COURAGE TO ACTUALLY SPEAK OUT 
AND COME OUT ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED 
THERE WAS EVIDENCE THERE TO PROVE THAT WHAT HAD HAPPENED DID HAPPEN 
AND A LOT OF IT WAS NEVER BROUGHT UP IN COURT 
TWELVE MONTHS AFTER THE POLICE INVESTIGATION 
THIS REPORT FROM JERSEY'S HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT 
OFFICIALLY CATALOGUED INSTANCES OF ABUSE AT BLANCHE PIERRE 
IT FOUND JANE MAGUIRE GUILTY OF GROSS MISCONDUCT 
AND RECOMMENDED HER DISMISSAL 
NINE YEARS ON FROM THOSE FIRST COMPLAINTS 
SHE FINALLY LEFT SOCIAL SERVICES 
IN THE LAST MONTH POLICE HAVE RECEIVED MORE INFORMATION 
ABOUT ALAN MAGUIRE INCLUDING ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE 
SO WHAT BECAME OF THE COUPLE 
OUR TRAIL LED HERE TO A REMOTE VILLAGE IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE 
POLICE HAVE LONG BELIEVED THAT ALAN MAGUIRE DIED OF A TERMINAL ILLNESS 
BUT WE DISCOVERED OTHERWISE 
ARE YOU GOING TO ANSWER ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS 
THIS WAS SURELY AN OPPORTUNITY TO REFUTE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THEM 
BUT THE MAGUIRES REFUSED TO SPEAK TO US 
MR. MAGUIRE WE WOULD LIKE 
GO ON TAKE MY PHOTO GO ON 
DO YOU ADMIT THAT YOU ABUSED SMALL GIRLS IN YOUR CARE 
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY DO YOU HAVE ANY REMORSE 
BYE 
WHAT ABOUT YOUR WIFE MR. MAGUIRE SHE WAS BEING CRUEL TO CHILDREN 
SHE MADE THEM DRINK DISINFECTANT 
MRS. MAGUIRE HIDING IN THE FRONT SEAT REMAINED SILENT THROUGHOUT 
YOU'VE RUINED THE LIVES OF MANY CHILDREN IN JERSEY 
DO YOU HAVE ANY REMORSE AT ALL 
AND THEN THEY LEFT 
THE CURRENT STATEMENT THEN SAID 
FORENSIC TAPING IS FINISHED IN THE SECOND CELLAR 
WE'VE TAPED THE WALLS AND JOISTS AND APPROACH TO THE SECOND CELLAR 
BACK IN JERSEY WE JOINED THE TEAM NOW TRACING A WEB OF INFORMATION 
CONNECTING HAUT DE LA GARENNE WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER CHILDREN'S HOMES 
FROM THE FIFTIES TO THE NINETIES 
YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED FROM INSTITUTION TO INSTITUTION 
AND IN SOME CASES THE STAFF THEY FEARED MOVED TOO 
ONE OF THE STAFF MEMBERS AT THIS HOME HEATHFIELD 
WAS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO'D ACTUALLY HELPED 
ANTON SKINNER REVIEW THE MAGUIRES' CASE 
AMONGST HIS CHARGES A BOY TRANSFERRED FROM BLANCHE PIERRE 
BUT ONCE AGAIN FRIGHTENED OF HIS CARER DARREN PICOT 
HALF THE TIME HE WAS JUST DROOLING OVER THE BOYS IN THE HOUSE 
YOU WERE LOOKING AND YOU THINK HE'S NOT LOOKING AT THEM RIGHT 
THIS IS NOT RIGHT THIS IS WRONG 
IT WAS THE WAY HE LOOKED AT PEOPLE 
IT WAS CREEPY AND UM 
HE JUST DIDN'T LOOK RIGHT 
HE WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO GET ME IN HIS HOUSE OR IN HIS OFFICE 
HE'D LOCK THE DOOR 
I WOULD PUSH HIM AWAY AND GET MYSELF OUT 
SHOVE HIM OUT OF THE WAY AND GET MYSELF OUT 
HE JUST WENT I WAS USELESS YOU KNOW I'M JUST NOTHING 
BUT YOU'RE SPECIAL 
HOLD ON A MINUTE I'M NOTHING BUT I'M SPECIAL 
IT DID BREAK ME DOWN A BIT 
LISA FARRINGTON WAS AT HEATHFIELD WITH DARREN 
SHE'S NOW TRAINING AS A SOCIAL WORKER IN SCOTLAND 
BUT SHE REMEMBERS THE NIGHTS HE SOUGHT SAFETY BY HIDING IN HER ROOM 
HE CAME AND GOT INTO BED WITH ME AND WAS JUST SHAKING 
HE WAS JUST TREMBLING 
I WAS LIKE YOU O. K. DARREN WHAT'S WRONG 
HE DIDN'T SAY NOTHING JUST CRYING JUST DOING THAT 
YEAH I DID BECAUSE I WAS SCARED 
OF COURSE I WAS SCARED I WAS CRAPPING MYSELF 
I THOUGHT SOME DIRTY BASTARD WAS GONNA GET HIS HANDS ON ME 
I THOUGHT IF I WAS IN ONE OF THE GIRL'S ROOMS 
HE WOULDN'T COME NEAR ME 
DARREN'S CLAIMS WERE ECHOED BY JAMES CAMPBELL 
HE RECALLED AN INCIDENT 
INVOLVING THE SAME STAFF MEMBER AND ANOTHER BOY 
THAT HE SAYS HE CAN NEVER FORGET 
I WALKED UP THE STAIRS I WALKED INTO A ROOM 
I OPENED THE DOOR AND I SEEN A MEMBER OF STAFF 
ON TOP OF ANOTHER LAD THAT LIVED IN THE HOME 
WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO THAT 
I CLOSED THE DOOR QUIETLY AND WALKED OFF 
WITHIN HALF AN HOUR I'D GONE TO SEE A MEMBER OF STAFF 
AND TOLD HER WHAT I'D SEEN 
HER REACTION TO IT WAS I MUSTN'T SAY THINGS LIKE THAT 
NO ONE TOOK ACTION AT THAT STAGE 
THE POLICE ONLY GOT INVOLVED WHEN AN ALLEGED VICTIM WENT TO THEM 
AND OTHER CHILDREN FROM HEATHFIELD CONTACTED THEIR CARE WORKERS 
LISA'S TOLD ME SHE REMEMBERS GIVING EVIDENCE 
TO WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS A CHILD PROTECTION PANEL 
SHE SAYS WITHIN DAYS THE STAFF MEMBER FROM HERE HAD GONE 
ANTON SKINNER STILL HEAD OF CHILDREN'S SERVICES 
HAD ONCE AGAIN ALLOWED SOMEONE ABOUT WHOM HE HAD DOUBTS TO RESIGN 
WE KNOW THAT MAN WENT BACK TO THE U. K. 
WHERE HE CONTINUED TO WORK WITH VULNERABLE YOUNG PEOPLE 
ALL WE WERE TOLD WAS THAT HE HAD GONE TO ENGLAND 
I THOUGHT HOW COULD THEY JUST LET HIM GO 
THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE INTERVIEWED ME STRAIGHT AWAY AND THE OTHER PEOPLE 
THE PERSON SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROSECUTED 
THE PERSON SHOULDN'T HAVE JUST BEEN LEFT TO LEAVE THE ISLAND 
MR. SKINNER TOLD US HE'D GIVEN THE MAN A REFERENCE 
PROVIDED THAT HE DIDN'T WORK WITH CHILDREN 
HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE INTERVIEWED 
BUT SAID HE'D ACTED IN THE INTERESTS OF CHILDREN AT ALL TIMES 
HE'S BY NO MEANS THE ONLY CHILD CARE OFFICIAL 
WHOSE DECISIONS MAY NOW BE SCRUTINISED 
IT'S TRUE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER CHILD ABUSE SCANDALS IN THE U. K. 
MANY OF WHICH WERE NOT WELL HANDLED 
BUT WHAT'S STRIKING IS THAT INSTITUTIONALLY 
JERSEY DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE HAD THE WILL TO GRASP THE PROBLEM UNTIL NOW 
DESPITE MOUNTING EVIDENCE 
ELEVEN YEARS AFTER THE U. K. INTRODUCED A SEXUAL OFFENCES REGISTER 
JERSEY STILL DOESN'T HAVE ONE POLICE SAY THEY'RE UNABLE TO MONITOR 
OVER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEX OFFENDERS LIVING ON THE ISLAND 
WE'RE GOING TO GO AND SEE HER AREN'T WE 
THIS OPERATION IS NOW MOVING TOWARDS AT LEAST THREE ARRESTS 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT SUSPECTS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BOTH ON THE ISLAND 
AND IN THE U. K. 
PANORAMA'S LEARNED THAT SOME OF THOSE BEING INVESTIGATED WERE 
UNTIL RECENTLY STILL INVOLVED WITH CHILD CARE 
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY 
THESE HISTORICAL ABUSE CASES NEVER ARE EASY 
THE TEAM THAT ARE WORKING GATHERING EVIDENCE 
ARE THE EQUAL OF ANY I'VE EVER SEEN ANYWHERE BEFORE 
NUMBERS OF VICTIMS ARE COMING FORWARD 
AND TALKING ABOUT THE SAME SUSPECTS 
WE ARE DETERMINED THAT NO MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES 
WE WILL ARREST PEOPLE FOR THESE OFFENCES 
AND WE WILL CONVICT PEOPLE FOR THEM 
FOR THE PRESENT JERSEY'S MINISTERS CAN ONLY WAIT 
FOR THAT CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TO RUN ITS COURSE 
BUT TOMORROW FACED WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF CIVIL CLAIMS 
THEY'LL ASK THE ISLAND'S PARLIAMENT TO APPROVE AN INDEPENDENT INQUIRY 
IT WILL BE CHAIRED BY A SENIOR BRITISH Q. C. 
THERE MAY ALSO BE INTERNAL ISSUES TO BE FOLLOWED AS WELL 
THERE WILL BE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED THAT'S FOR SURE 
YOU WILL NAME NAMES EVEN IF PEOPLE CAN'T BE PROSECUTED 
WE WILL 
BACK AT HAUT DE LA GARENNE 
I WAS ALLOWED TO WATCH SEARCHERS CLEARING A PATH TO FURTHER CELLARS 
ALLEGED VICTIMS HAVE DESCRIBED TWO MORE AREAS 
HIDDEN BEHIND THIS BLOCKWORK 
MORE SECRETS TO UNCOVER MORE TRAUMATIC REMINDERS FOR THE VICTIMS 
I SOUGHT REFUGE IN ALCOHOL 
TO BLOCK OUT THE MADNESS OF WHAT HAPPENED 
IT'S NOT OVER FOR YOU IS IT 
NO 
IT NEVER WILL BE 
A FEW YARDS FROM WHERE THE SKULL FRAGMENT WAS FOUND 
ANOTHER TEAM HAVE BEGUN WORK 
BELOW THE TARMAC WHERE CHILDREN ONCE PLAYED 
HAUT DE LA GARENNE REMAINS AT THE HEART OF THE INQUIRY 
BUT IN A WAY IT'S JUST A STARTING POINT 
A CATALYST FOR CHANGE THAT MANY BELIEVE IS LONG OVERDUE 
EVENTS STRETCHING BACK OVER HALF A CENTURY 
WILL CONTINUE TO HAUNT JERSEY FOR A GOOD WHILE YET 
ROBERT HALL REPORTING AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE PROGRESS 
OF THE HAUT DE LA GARENNE INVESTIGATION AS IT DEVELOPS 
OVER THE COMING MONTHS 
BY THE WAY WE HAVE OF COURSE 
HANDED OVER THE RESULTS OF PANORAMA'S RESEARCH 
TO THE POLICE IN JERSEY 
NEXT WEEK PANORAMA IS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
WE ASK WHY THEY ARE BUILDING MORE PEACE WALLS 
INSTEAD OF PULLING THEM DOWN 
THERE ARE THINGS 
WAITING IN THE DARKNESS 
CREATURES OF METAL AND FIRE AND BLOOD 
BUT HE'S OUT THERE BURNING THROUGH TIME 
FACING A THOUSAND DANGERS ACROSS THE STARS AND NEVER GIVING UP 
HE LOOKS LIKE A MAN BUT HE'S A LEGEND AND HIS NAME 
IS THE DOCTOR 
HE'LL COME BACK TO SAVE US 
AND THIS TIME I'M GONNA BE READY 
THEN JUST LIKE THAT 
WE'LL BE GONE
