REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS ARE SOMETIMES THOUGHT OF AS PRIMITIVE DULL AND DIM WITTED 
IN FACT OF COURSE THEY CAN BE LETHALLY FAST 
SPECTACULARLY BEAUTIFUL 
SURPRISINGLY AFFECTIONATE AND VERY SOPHISTICATED 
THEY HAVE REMARKABLY VARIED WAYS OF CATCHING THEIR PREY 
AND OF DEFENDING THEMSELVES 
THEY CAN PRODUCE A GREAT TURN OF SPEED 
AND FIGHT WITH IMPRESSIVE ZEST 
SOME HAVE SPECTACULAR COLOURS AND SHOW OFF TO ONE ANOTHER 
THEY COMMUNICATE WITH CALLS 
AND WITH GESTURES 
AND THERE THAT'S IT 
THE FULL WORKS 
REPTILES HAVE SCALY SKINS 
AND AMPHIBIANS SOFT MOIST ONES 
NONE OF THEM LIVE AT A UNIFORM PACE 
BUT SWITCH FROM THE FAST TO THE SLOW LANE WITHIN A YEAR OR AN HOUR 
UNLIKE US THEY GET THEIR ENERGY DIRECTLY FROM THE SUN 
AND ALTHOUGH BEING CALLED COLD BLOODED 
MIGHT SUGGEST THEY ARE UNEMOTIONAL 
THEY CAN BE TOUCHINGLY WARM HEARTED AS MATES 
AND AS PARENTS 
AND THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING 
THERE ARE A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER WARM HEARTED TRUTHS TO BE DISCOVERED 
TO GIVE THE PHRASE LIFE IN COLD BLOOD A COMPLETELY NEW MEANING 
THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS 
SOME OF THE REPTILES THAT LIVE HERE ARE PARTICULARLY SKILFUL 
AT SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF GETTING THEIR ENERGY DIRECTLY FROM SUNSHINE 
MARINE IGUANAS FACE A MAJOR THERMAL CHALLENGE 
EVERY MORNING OF THEIR LIVES 
DURING THE NIGHT THEIR BODIES COOL 
AND NOW THEY MUST WARM UP QUICKLY 
IN ORDER THAT THEY CAN BECOME ACTIVE AND START FEEDING 
THEIR BODIES AND SKINS ARE BLACK 
WHICH IS VERY EFFICIENT AT ABSORBING HEAT 
AND THEY BASK WITH THEIR BLACK FLANKS BROADSIDE TO THE SUN 
THE RATE AT WHICH THEY ABSORB WARMTH IS INVISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE 
BUT VERY CLEAR INDEED TO A THERMAL CAMERA 
FIRST THING THEY'RE COLD AND PURPLISH BLUE 
BUT SLOWLY AS THEY WARM UP 
A GOLDEN GLOW SPREADS THROUGH THEIR BODIES 
AND EVENTUALLY AFTER HALF AN HOUR OR SO 
THEY BECOME AS HOT AS THE ROCKS BENEATH THEM 
ONCE THEY ARE THOROUGHLY WARMED UP 
MARINE IGUANAS CAN MAINTAIN THEIR BODY TEMPERATURE 
JUST ABOUT AS CONSTANTLY AS I CAN AND WHAT'S MORE 
AT ABOUT THE SAME LEVEL OR INDEED SLIGHTLY HIGHER 
AROUND THIRTY SEVEN DEGREES CENTIGRADE 
NOW THEY NEED TO FEED 
THERE'S NOTHING TO EAT ON OR AROUND THESE BARREN ROCKS EXCEPT SEAWEED 
AND TO GET THAT THEY'LL HAVE TO SWIM 
BUT THE SEA AROUND HERE IS SURPRISINGLY COLD 
AROUND FIFTEEN TO SIXTEEN DEGREES C. ENTIGRADE 
AND ONLY THE BIGGER IGUANAS CAN ABSORB ENOUGH HEAT 
TO POWER THE DIVES TO ENABLE THEM TO GO TO THE SEAWEED AT ANY DEPTH 
HOWEVER THEIR BODIES ARE NOW THOROUGH WARMED UP 
THE THERMAL CAMERA SHOWS THEM AS GOLDEN YELLOW 
AS THEY CLAMBER DOWN 
OVER THE COLD BLUE ROCKS AND DIVE INTO THE SEA 
ALTHOUGH THEIR ISLANDS LIE ALMOST EXACTLY ON THE EQUATOR 
THE SEA HERE IS PERMANENTLY CHILLED 
BY A COLD CURRENT THAT SWEEPS UP FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE OCEAN 
SO THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO STAY IN THE WATER FOR VERY LONG 
THEY HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE 
IN THE SHALLOWS CLOSE TO THE SHORE 
THE SEAWEED HAS BEEN HEAVILY CROPPED 
TO GET A GOOD MEAL 
THEY MAY HAVE TO DIVE TO AT LEAST FIFTEEN FEET FIVE METRES 
THEY'RE ABLE TO REDUCE THE CHILLING EFFECT OF THE COLD WATER BY CLOSING 
DOWN THE BLOOD SUPPLY TO THEIR LIMBS AND THE OUTER PART OF THEIR BODIES 
BUT EVEN SO THEIR BODY TEMPERATURE MAY DROP BY TEN DEGREES OR SO 
A COOLING LIKE THAT WOULD KILL A HUMAN DIVER 
AFTER FIVE TO TEN MINUTES ON THE SEA FLOOR MOST IGUANAS HAVE HAD ENOUGH 
AND THEY RETURN TO THE SURFACE 
AND THE LIFE SAVING WARMTH OF THE ROCKY SHORE 
A RECENTLY EMERGED IGUANA IS BLACK IT'S CHILLED TO THE BONE 
NOW THEY NEED HEAT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DIGEST THAT MEAL OF SEAWEED 
AND THEY GET THAT BY SPREAD EAGLING THEMSELVES 
ON THESE BLACK HOT SUN BAKED ROCKS 
THEIR IMAGE WARMS FROM BLACK 
TO PURPLE 
AND THEN FROM RED TO ORANGE 
IN THE EVENING THE TEMPERATURE FALLS 
AND THEY HUDDLE TOGETHER TO RETAIN THEIR WARMTH AS LONG AS POSSIBLE 
THEY WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE FOLLOWING MORNING 
BEFORE THEY CAN RE WARM THEMSELVES SUFFICIENTLY TO FEED AGAIN 
MOST KINDS OF LIZARDS HAVE THIS DAILY SCHEDULE 
SIDE BLOTCHED LIZARDS IN CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY DO 
YOU CAN SEE FROM THE COLOUR OF MY FACE THAT MY BODY IS WARM 
THAT'S BECAUSE I'VE GOT A CENTRAL HEATING SYSTEM 
WHICH I HAVE FUELLED WITH MY BREAKFAST 
IS USED IN KEEPING MY BODY TEMPERATURE HIGH AND STEADY 
THESE LIZARDS HOWEVER SQUANDER VERY LITTLE OF THE ENERGY 
OF THE ENERGY THEY GET FROM THEIR FOOD ON WARMING THEMSELVES 
THEY LIKE THE MARINE IGUANAS 
GET NEARLY ALL THEY NEED FOR THAT BY BASKING ON THE WARM ROCKS 
AND SO IMPORTANT IS THE NEED FOR WARMTH 
THAT THE FEMALES ACTUALLY CHOOSE THEIR MALES 
ON THE BASIS OF WHICH HAS THE BEST UNDERFLOOR HEATING 
EACH MALE SITS ON HIS PILE OF BOULDERS DOING PRESS UPS 
TO SIGNAL HIS OWNERSHIP AND TO WARN OFF OTHER MALES 
INTRUDERS ARE CONFRONTED IMMEDIATELY AND IF NECESSARY ATTACKED 
AND THE VICTOR RETURNS TO SIT ON HIS WONDERFULLY WARM THRONE 
LOOK AT HIS ROCKY KINGDOM WITH A THERMAL CAMERA 
AND IT'S IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHY IT'S SO PRECIOUS 
THE ROCKS ARE VERY MUCH HOTTER THAN THE SURROUNDING GRASSLAND 
AND BIG TALL ONES CATCH THE SUN EARLIER AND RETAIN ITS HEAT LONGER 
SO NOT ONLY DOES THE SUN WARM HIM FROM ABOVE 
HIS ROCKS DO FROM BENEATH 
THE MOST POWERFUL DOMINANT MALE HAS NATURALLY THE BEST PILE OF ROCKS 
AND NOT SURPRISINGLY ALMOST ALL THE FEMALES 
BUT IS IT THE MALES THEMSELVES 
OR THEIR ASSETS THAT THE FEMALES ARE INTERESTED IN 
TO FIND OUT LET'S MOVE THEIR HOT ROCKS 
AND GIVE THEM TO A SUBORDINATE MALE 
THE FEMALES QUICKLY RECOGNISE THAT A MORE DESIRABLE RESIDENCE 
HAS APPEARED IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND START TO MOVE ACROSS 
AND THE SEX STARVED WIMP SUDDENLY FINDS HIMSELF AMAZINGLY POPULAR 
SO THE FEMALES DO INDEED GO FOR THE MALES WITH THE HOTTEST ROCKS 
THESE LIZARDS ON A SMALL ISLET 
OFF THE SHORES OF MENORCA IN THE MEDITERRANEAN 
GET THEIR HEAT FROM ANOTHER AND VERY UNUSUAL SOURCE 
OW 
THEY'RE VERY CURIOUS I'M THE NEW BOY ON THE BLOCK 
THE NEW OBJECT IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT 
AND THAT ONE JUST GAVE ME A LITTLE NIP 
THEY INVESTIGATE THE WORLD AROUND THEM BY TASTING IT 
AND THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO WORK OUT WHAT I AM 
THEIR ISLAND IS ROCKY AND NOT PARTICULARLY RICH IN FOOD 
THE LIZARDS ARE PRIMARILY INSECT EATERS 
BUT DURING THE FLOWERING SEASON THEY ALSO TAKE NECTAR 
THEY COLLECT IT FROM PLANTS LIKE SPURGE WHICH IS VERY COMMON 
AND THEY HAVE A VERY SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS FLOWER 
IT'S CALLED THE DEAD HORSE ARUM 
IT CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE CARRION 
AND 
OOH DEAR ME IT SMELLS VERY STRONGLY OF CARRION 
AS A CONSEQUENCE OF BOTH ITS LOOKS AND ITS SMELL 
IT ATTRACTS CARRION FLIES 
OF COURSE IT'S THE FLIES THAT THE LIZARDS ARE AFTER 
BUT AS WELL AS PROVIDING FOOD FOR THE LIZARDS 
THIS EXTRAORDINARY FLOWER HELPS THEM IN ANOTHER WAY 
THIS CENTRAL PART WHICH IS CALLED A SPADIX 
IS SLIGHTLY WARM AS YOU CAN SEE FROM A THERMAL CAMERA 
THE CHEMICAL PROCESS THAT PRODUCES THE DISGUSTING SMELL 
ALSO CREATES HEAT AND RAISES THE TEMPERATURE OF THE FLOWER 
BY UP TO FIVE DEGREES ABOVE THE SURROUNDINGS 
SUFFICIENTLY HIGH FOR A LIZARD TO WARM ITSELF ON IT ON A COLD MORNING 
AND IN CASE YOU FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE 
HERE IS CONFIRMATION FROM THE THERMAL CAMERA 
THE PURPLISH BLUE LIZARD QUICKLY TAKES ON 
THE SAME TEMPERATURE AND COLOUR AS THE ARUM 
AND SITTING ON ARUMS BRINGS ANOTHER BENEFIT 
BREAKFAST 
A FLY LURED BY THE SMELL CRAWLS INSIDE 
THE LIZARD HEARS THE FLY BUZZING WITHIN 
THE FLY OF COURSE 
CAN'T FIND ANYTHING IT WANTS BUT NOW IT CAN'T GET OUT 
THE ENTRANCE TO THE FLOWER IS BLOCKED BY THE LIZARD 
AND THE LIZARD GETS AN EASY MEAL 
TWO MONTHS LATER 
THE ARUM FLOWERS HAVE SHRIVELLED AND PRODUCED THEIR FRUITS 
UNTIL TWENTY YEARS AGO THE LIZARDS IGNORED THESE WITHERED BUNDLES 
AFTER ALL THEY HARDLY LOOK LIKE FOOD 
BUT THEN A PARTICULARLY INQUISITIVE INDIVIDUAL 
SAMPLED A FRUIT AND FOUND THE SOFT FLESH AROUND THE SEED RATHER GOOD 
THE HABIT SPREAD AND NOW THE WHOLE LIZARD POPULATION 
UNIQUELY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN HAVE BECOME ARUM FRUIT EATERS 
THEY DO TAKE A BIT OF SWALLOWING 
BUT SEEDS PASSING THROUGH A LIZARD'S GUT NOT ONLY SURVIVE 
BUT GERMINATE EVEN MORE EASILY 
AS A RESULT THE ARUMS WHICH WERE RATHER SCARCE HERE TWENTY YEARS AGO 
HAVE SUDDENLY BECOME ABUNDANT ALL OVER THE ISLAND 
A COLD WINDSWEPT ISLAND OFF THE COAST OF SOUTH AFRICA 
IS NOT THE FIRST PLACE YOU WOULD GO TO IF YOU WERE LOOKING FOR REPTILES 
BUT HERE ON DASSEN ISLAND AMONG PENGUINS AND SEAGULLS 
THERE'S ONE OF THE GREATEST CONCENTRATION OF TORTOISES 
TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE ON EARTH 
THERE ARE ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND OF THEM ON THIS ONE TINY ISLAND 
THE PENGUINS AND OTHER BIRDS THANKS TO THEIR WARM BLOOD 
ARE ACTIVE NO MATTER HOW COLD IT IS 
BUT THE TORTOISES HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE DAY TO WARM UP 
BEFORE THEY CAN GET ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS 
THEY BASK IN THE SUNSHINE POWERING UP THEIR BODIES 
TO THE OPTIMUM WORKING TEMPERATURE OF THIRTY THREE DEGREES CENTIGRADE 
AND THEN THEY GO OFF TO FEED 
AS THE DAY PROGRESSES THE TEMPERATURE RISES QUICKLY 
AND EVEN BEFORE NOON IT'S TOO HOT FOR COMFORT 
THE TORTOISES HAVE TO HEAD FOR SHADE 
IN THE LATE AFTERNOON IT GETS COOLER 
AND THE TORTOISES VENTURE OUT AGAIN 
FOR THEM THIS IS THE BEST TIME 
THEY'RE THOROUGHLY WARMED UP 
THEY'VE DIGESTED THEIR MORNING MEAL AND THEY'VE GOT ENERGY TO SPARE 
THE MALES BEGIN TO FIGHT 
JOUSTING LIKE MEDIEVAL KNIGHTS 
USING A PROJECTION ON THE FRONT OF THE SHELL LIKE A LANCE 
THE TECHNIQUE IS TO GET THE SPIKE UNDER YOUR OPPONENT 
AND THEN FLICK HIM OVER ON TO HIS BACK 
CONTESTS CAN LAST FOR HALF AN HOUR 
THE LOSER TRIES TO RIGHT HIMSELF 
BUT THE WINNER KEEPS BITING HIS LEGS 
AT LAST THE VICTOR LOSES INTEREST AND GOES OFF TO FIND THE FEMALE 
WHO CAUSED THE ARGUMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE 
AS FOR THE LOSER IF HE DOESN'T MANAGE TO RIGHT HIMSELF SOON 
HE MAY COOK IN THE SUN 
TORTOISES ARE ABLE TO SUNBATHE OUT IN THE OPEN 
BECAUSE THEIR STRONG BONY SHELL 
GIVES THEM ALMOST COMPLETE PROTECTION FROM PREDATORS 
LESS WELL ARMOURED REPTILES LIKE LIZARDS ARE VULNERABLE OF COURSE 
TO HAWKS AND COYOTES AND FOXES AND CATS 
AND IN THE MORNING WHEN THOSE WARM BLOODED ANIMALS 
ARE ALREADY ACTIVE 
THE LIZARDS ARE COLD AND CAN'T MOVE FAST SO THEY HAVE A PROBLEM 
YOU REALLY CAN'T SEE THEM UNTIL YOU ARE RIGHT ON TOP OF THEM 
AND THERE'S ONE THERE 
I'M IN ARIZONA 
AND THAT AT MY FEET IS A LIZARD BURIED IN THE SAND UP TO ITS NECK 
EVEN WHILE IT'S BURIED IT CAN USE THE SUNSHINE TO WARM ITS WHOLE BODY 
IT CAN CONTROL THE SUPPLY OF BLOOD TO ITS HEAD 
SO THAT IT POOLS IN A CAVITY BEHIND THE EYE 
SOON THE BLOOD THERE IS AS MUCH AS FIVE DEGREES 
ABOVE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE REST OF ITS BODY 
THEN THE ANIMAL OPENS THE MAJOR BLOOD VESSELS IN ITS NECK 
AND THE HOT BLOOD CIRCULATES 
SO THAT ITS WHOLE BODY IS THOROUGHLY WARMED 
EVEN THOUGH IT'S STILL MOSTLY BELOW GROUND 
THIS 
IS A HORNED LIZARD 
AND VERY BEAUTIFUL TOO 
THIS PARTICULAR SPECIES IS CALLED THE REGAL HORNED LIZARD 
BECAUSE IT HAS THIS SPLENDID CROWN OF SPIKES AT THE BACK OF HIS NECK 
WHEN HE'S HIDDEN THEY BREAK UP THE OUTLINE OF HIS HEAD 
AND SO YOU HARDLY SEE HIM AT ALL 
AND NOW IN THE WARMTH OF MY HAND AND IN THE SUNSHINE 
I GUESS HE HAS WARMED UP QUITE A LOT AND IF I PUT HIM DOWN 
HE NOW AT LAST MAY BE ABLE TO RUN FOR IT 
AND INDEED HE DOES 
SOUTH AFRICAN ARMADILLO LIZARDS WHICH LIVE ON THESE ROCKY OUTCROPS 
HAVE A DIFFERENT SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF SAFE SUNBATHING 
THEY'VE TURNED IT INTO A SOCIAL ACTIVITY 
WHOLE FAMILIES OF THEM LIVE TOGETHER IN THE CREVICES AMONG THE ROCKS 
AND IN THE MORNING THEY ALL EMERGE TO WARM UP IN THE SUN 
OF COURSE THERE IS SAFETY IN NUMBERS 
THERE ARE LOTS OF EYES TO SPOT DANGER IF IT APPEARS 
AND WHEN ONE SUNBATHER TAKES FRIGHT THEY ALL DIVE FOR SAFETY 
IF A PREDATOR IS QUICK IT IS POSSIBLE TO GRAB ONE 
BUT EVEN THEN AN ARMADILLO LIZARD IS NOT GOING TO BE AN EASY MEAL 
OW 
THEY HAVE AN ADDITIONAL FORM OF DEFENCE 
THEY BITE THEIR TAILS 
THE REASON THEY DO THAT IS THAT IT COVERS UP 
THEIR VULNERABLE UNDERSIDE 
AND EXPOSES ONLY THESE VERY SHARP SPINY SCALES 
WHICH IS A VERY GOOD PROTECTION 
AGAINST PREDATORS LIKE SNAKES OR MONGOOSES 
THEY STAY LIKE THIS FOR QUITE A LONG TIME 
BEFORE THEY ARE CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO UNCURL 
I'LL PUT HIM DOWN AND SEE HOW HE DOES 
SUNSET NECESSARILY BRINGS AN END TO ACTIVITY FOR MOST REPTILES 
BUT NOT FOR ALL 
A LEOPARD GECKO 
IT LIKE MOST GECKOS IS NOCTURNAL 
AND IT MANAGES TO GET ALL THE HEAT IT NEEDS FROM THE ROCKS 
WHICH RETAIN SOMETHING OF THEIR WARMTH 
FOR SEVERAL HOURS AFTER THE SUN HAS SET 
THIS MALE IS IN SEARCH OF A MATE 
SHE IS LESS BRIGHTLY COLOURED 
THEY INSPECT ONE ANOTHER 
HE COLLECTS HER SCENT WITH HIS TONGUE 
AND DISCOVERS THAT NOT ONLY IS SHE FEMALE BUT SHE'S SEXUALLY AVAILABLE 
HE'S INTERESTED 
HE NIBBLES HER NECK AND STROKES HER FLANKS 
ALL PART OF HIS ELABORATE COURTSHIP ROUTINE 
COPULATION BEGINS 
THIS IS THE TIME IN MAMMALS AND BIRDS 
WHEN THE SEX OF THE YOUNG IS DETERMINED 
BUT NOT IN A NUMBER OF REPTILES INCLUDING GECKOS 
ONCE AGAIN IT'S TEMPERATURE THAT PROFOUNDLY INFLUENCES THEIR LIVES 
THE FEMALE GOES AWAY TO LAY HER EGGS 
SHE HAS CHOSEN A PLACE WHERE THE TEMPERATURE IS ABOUT THIRTY ONE DEGREES 
AS HER BODY IS THE SAME TEMPERATURE AS HER ENVIRONMENT 
SHE CAN'T HEAT HER EGGS BY SITTING ON THEM AS WARM BLOODED BIRDS DO 
SO THEY'RE EXACTLY THE SAME TEMPERATURE AS THE ROCKS BENEATH 
AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS BOTH EGGS BEGIN TO HATCH 
THE FIRST TO EMERGE IS A MALE 
AND THE SECOND WILL BE TOO 
IT'S THE TEMPERATURE WHICH HAS DETERMINED THAT 
IF IT HAD BEEN A FEW DEGREES LOWER 
BOTH EGGS WOULD HAVE DEVELOPED INTO FEMALES 
CROCODILES HAVE THEIR SEX DETERMINED BY TEMPERATURE IN A SIMILAR WAY 
THIS CLUTCH BELONGS TO THE INDIAN FISH EATING CROCODILE THE GHARIAL 
THE FEMALE HAS HEARD THE CALLS FROM BELOW GROUND 
MADE BY HER HATCHING YOUNG 
AND IS HELPING THEM TO DIG THEIR WAY OUT OF THE SAND 
THEY IMMEDIATELY MAKE THEIR WAY DOWN TO THE WATER 
AND MOTHER GOES TOO 
HERE OF COURSE THEY ARE NICE AND WARM 
WATER RETAINS ITS DAYTIME HEAT BETTER AND LONGER THAN ROCK 
SO UNLIKE MANY OTHER REPTILES GHARIALS AND OTHER CROCODILIANS 
HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO FEED ACTIVELY ALL NIGHT 
WHILE BEING NOCTURNAL IS UNUSUAL AMONG REPTILES 
IT'S THE NORM FOR AMPHIBIANS 
THEIR SKIN IS NOT SCALY AND WATERTIGHT LIKE A REPTILE'S 
IT'S SOFT MOIST AND PERMEABLE 
IF THEY EXPOSED THEMSELVES TO SUNLIGHT FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME 
THEY WOULD DRY OUT AND DIE 
SO MOST FROGS ONLY LEAVE THEIR SHELTERS AT NIGHT 
SINCE THEY CAN'T ABSORB SUNSHINE DIRECTLY 
THEY EITHER GET HEAT FROM THEIR SURROUNDINGS 
OR DRAW THEIR ENERGY FROM THE FAT RESERVES 
THAT THEY BUILT UP WHEN THE FEEDING WAS GOOD 
BUT EVEN SO THEY SELDOM HOP UNLESS THEY HAVE VERY GOOD REASON TO DO SO 
THIS FROG HOWEVER THE SOUTH AMERICAN WAXY MONKEY FROG 
IS EXCEPTIONAL 
IT'S ONE OF THE FEW THAT CAN TOLERATE 
DIRECT SUNSHINE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME 
AND THAT IS BECAUSE IT SECRETES A WAX FROM GLANDS ON ITS NECK 
NO HUMAN SUNBATHER GOES TO MORE TROUBLE THAN THEY DO 
TO MAKE QUITE SURE THAT EVERY PART OF THEIR SKIN IS PROPERLY ANOINTED 
THE SUNSHINE MAY ALSO BRING THEM AN EXTRA BENEFIT 
IT PROBABLY PROTECTS THEM FROM THE FUNGAL INFECTIONS 
TO WHICH MANY MOIST SKINNED AMPHIBIANS ARE PRONE 
IN THE RAINFORESTS OF CENTRAL AMERICA 
THE AIR IS HEAVY WITH MOISTURE 
SO THE POISON ARROW FROGS 
CAN RISK BASKING IN THE LITTLE PATCHES OF SUNSHINE 
THAT DAPPLE THE FOREST FLOOR AND IF THEY BEGIN TO DRY OUT 
THEY CAN RETREAT INTO THE LEAF LITTER 
THE SUNSHINE GIVES THEM SUFFICIENT ENERGY TO PERMIT THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF 
CALLING ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY IN DEFENCE OF THEIR TERRITORIES 
THEY EVEN HAVE ENOUGH SPARE ENERGY 
TO INDULGE IN LONG BATTLES WITH THEIR NEIGHBOURS 
THESE FIGHTS CAN GO ON FOR WELL OVER HALF AN HOUR AT A TIME 
UNTIL BOTH CONTESTANTS ARE COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED 
SO A MOIST SKIN LIMITS NOT ONLY WHERE AMPHIBIANS CAN LIVE 
BUT HOW ENERGETIC THEY CAN BE 
OUT IN THE SUNSHINE DRY SKINNED REPTILES HAVE MORE OPTIONS 
BY COLLECTING SOLAR POWER SO EFFICIENTLY 
REPTILES NEED TO USE VERY LITTLE OF THE ENERGY THEY GENERATE THEMSELVES 
TO WARM THEIR BODIES 
IN FACT THEY USE AROUND A TENTH 
COMPARED WITH A MAMMAL OF A SIMILAR SIZE 
THAT MEANS THEY DON'T HAVE TO EAT VERY OFTEN 
A PUFF ADDER LIKE THIS ONE 
CAN WAIT ALMOST INDEFINITELY FOR ITS NEXT MEAL 
AMONGST PREDATORS PATIENCE REALLY IS A VIRTUE 
WHILST WAITING FOR A MEAL TO WANDER WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE 
A SNAKE SHUTS DOWN ITS BODY PROCESSES 
SO THAT IT USES THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF ENERGY 
ONLY THE EQUIVALENT OF A PILOT LIGHT IS LEFT ON 
AND IT CAN REMAIN LIKE THIS FOR WEEKS 
ALL AROUND IT MAMMALS ARE EXPENDING THEIR ENERGY IN A WAY THAT 
COMPARED WITH THE SNAKE SEEMS EXTRAORDINARILY EXTRAVAGANT 
BUT WHEN A SNAKE NEEDS TO MOVE FAST IT CAN DO SO WITH LIGHTNING SPEED 
ONCE ITS PREY IS SECURED A SNAKE CAN TAKE ITS TIME OVER ITS MEAL 
THIS GIGANTIC PYTHON IS FEEDING ON A DEER 
A PYTHON KILLS ITS PREY BY WRAPPING ITS COILS AROUND IT AND SQUEEZING 
ITS VICTIM SO TIGHTLY AND FOR LONG THAT IT CAN NO LONGER BREATHE 
BUT SWALLOWING ITS MEAL TAKES TIME 
THE DEER WILL GO DOWN HEAD FIRST 
IT'S MUCH EASIER THAT WAY 
THE LIGAMENTS CONNECTING THE SNAKE'S UPPER AND LOWER JAW ARE ELASTIC 
SO THAT IT CAN ENGULF THE DEER'S HEAD 
EVEN THOUGH IT IS MUCH BIGGER THAN ITS OWN 
WITH ITS MOUTH STRETCHED TIGHTLY AROUND ITS MEAL 
THE SNAKE CAN'T BREATHE IN A NORMAL WAY 
BUT IT'S ABLE TO PUSH THE TOP OF ITS WINDPIPE RIGHT OUT OF ITS MOUTH 
AND SO CONTINUE TO TAKE IN AIR 
AFTER SOME HOURS ALL THAT CAN BE SEEN OF THE DEER ARE ITS HIND LEGS 
ONCE THE MEAL HAS BEEN COMPLETELY SWALLOWED 
THE INNER WORKINGS OF THE SNAKE'S BODY CHANGE GREATLY 
ITS DIGESTIVE PROCESSES SWITCH TO FULL POWER 
AND INCREASE THEIR ACTIVITY FORTY TIMES 
THERE IS AN EXPLOSION OF BIOCHEMICAL ACTIVITY 
THE LIVER THE SECRETIONS OF WHICH POWER DIGESTION 
DOUBLES IN SIZE WITHIN TWO DAYS 
THE HEART GROWS BY SOME FORTY PER CENT 
IT WILL TAKE THE PYTHON AT LEAST A WEEK TO COMPLETELY DIGEST THIS ENORMOUS MEAL 
BUT THEN IT WILL NOT NEED TO FEED AGAIN FOR MONTHS OR EVEN A YEAR 
THIS ABILITY TO SWITCH OFF 
HELPS REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS IN ANOTHER WAY 
A BABY NORTH AMERICAN PAINTED TURTLE 
IT AND THE REST OF ITS CLUTCH HAVE ONLY JUST HATCHED 
BUT IT'S LATE IN THE YEAR AND THE CHILL OF WINTER HAS ALREADY BEGUN 
IF THE HATCHLINGS CLAMBERED OUT OF THEIR HOLE NOW 
THEY WOULD FIND NOTHING TO EAT SO THEY STAY WHERE THEY ARE 
THE TEMPERATURE WILL FALL TO MINUS TEN DEGREES 
ICE CRYSTALS GROW AROUND THE BABIES AND EVEN INSIDE THEIR BODIES 
BUT THEIR TISSUES ARE PROTECTED BY A KIND OF ANTIFREEZE 
THIS WOULD KILL ANY MAMMAL OR BIRD 
THEY REMAIN IN THIS DEEP FREEZE FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS 
BUT SPRING COMES AT LAST 
THE ICE MELTS AROUND THEM AND EVENTUALLY WITHIN THEM 
SLOWLY THEY BEGIN TO COME TO LIFE 
IT TAKES QUITE A TIME FOR THEM TO BECOME FULLY FUNCTIONAL 
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY ARE READY TO FACE THE OUTSIDE WORLD 
SO BY ALLOWING THEIR BODIES TO COOL THEY HAVE AVOIDED THE HARD TIMES 
WITH THE ARRIVAL OF SPRING 
THE MALE COURTS THE FEMALE 
BY GENTLY STRUMMING HER CHEEKS WITH HIS LONG CLAWS 
AND SHE RESPONDS 
COLD BLOOD IS CLEARLY NO BARRIER TO AFFECTION 
IN FACT REPTILES CAN CONDUCT 
AS COMPLEX AND AS SENSITIVE A COURTSHIP AS MANY A MAMMAL 
THIS IS THE BIGGEST OF ALL LIVING REPTILES AND ONE OF THE MOST FEARED 
IF ONE CREATURE WERE TO BE LABELLED A COLD BLOODED KILLER 
IT WOULD BE THIS 
A SALTWATER CROCODILE 
A MONSTER THAT CAN GROW TO A LENGTH OF TWENTY FEET SIX METRES 
AND WEIGH A TONNE 
BUT MALE AND FEMALE WHEN THEY COURT 
BLOW BUBBLES AT ONE ANOTHER 
HE IS THREE TIMES HER SIZE AND COULD EASILY CRUSH HER 
YET HE TREATS HER WITH GREAT GENTLENESS 
HE STROKES HER BACK 
SLOWLY HE ALIGNS HIS BODY WITH HERS 
SO UNION IS ACHIEVED 
CROCODILES ARE AMONG THE MOST ANCIENT OF REPTILES 
THEIR ANCESTORS APPEARED AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS THE DINOSAURS 
BUT WHAT ABOUT THEM WERE DINOSAURS SIMILARLY COLD BLOODED 
THE ROCKS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN WEST 
ARE PARTICULARLY RICH IN DINOSAUR FOSSILS 
A HUNDRED MILLION YEARS AGO 
THIS WAS A HORIZONTAL MUD FLAT AT THE EDGE OF THE SEA 
AND ACROSS IT CAME AN ADULT DINOSAUR 
WITH A SMALLER YOUNGER ONE TROTTING ALONGSIDE 
LEAVING THEIR FOOTPRINTS BEHIND TO BE FOSSILISED 
THEY WERE IGUANADONS A HERD OF THEM 
TOGETHER WITH SOME BIRD FOOTED DINOSAURS 
WERE THESE ALL SOLAR POWERED 
SOME OF THE ANCIENT REPTILES HAD SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS 
TO HELP THEM COLLECT HEAT 
THIS IS A PLATE FROM THE BACK OF A STEGOSAURUS 
AND YOU CAN STILL SEE THE LINES WHERE THE BLOOD VESSELS RAN 
WHICH COLLECTED THE HEAT AND CARRIED IT TO THE REST OF THE BODY 
SO FOR THE STEGOSAURUS AT LEAST THE NEED TO COLLECT HEAT 
SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN JUST AS IMPORTANT 
AS IT IS FOR ITS RELATIVES ALIVE TODAY 
BUT THERE ARE CLUES THAT SUGGEST THAT ANCIENT REPTILES WERE BETTER AT 
MAINTAINING THEIR TEMPERATURE THAN THEIR MODERN COUNTERPARTS 
THIS IS THE JAW BONE OF A VERY LARGE AND VERY FAMOUS DINOSAUR 
IN LIFE ITS HEAD WOULD HAVE BEEN EIGHTEEN FEET SIX METRES ABOVE GROUND 
THIS IS THE JAW OF TYRANNOSAURUS REX 
AN ANIMAL AS BIG AS THIS HAS A VERY LARGE BODY MASS 
WHICH RETAINS HEAT VERY WELL 
SO PERHAPS THESE HUGE DINOSAURS WERE IN FACT WARM ALL THE TIME 
SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO BIG TO LOSE ALL THEIR HEAT OVERNIGHT 
AS A SMALLER REPTILE WOULD 
BUT WHAT ABOUT WHEN THEY WERE SMALL 
WERE ADOLESCENT TYRANNOSAURS ABLE TO MAINTAIN A STEADY BODY TEMPERATURE 
WERE THEY IN SHORT WARM BLOODED 
EVIDENCE ON THAT CAN BE FOUND 
IN THE MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF THEIR BONES 
THIS 
IS THE LEG BONE OF A YOUNG TYRANNOSAURUS 
AND IT HAS BANDS IN IT 
THE INNER SECTION FORMED WHEN THE ANIMAL WAS YOUNG 
HAS AN OPEN STRUCTURE 
LIKE THE BONE OF A FAST GROWING WARM BLOODED MAMMAL 
THE OUTER PART IS MORE DENSE MORE LIKE THAT OF TODAY'S REPTILES 
BUT WHETHER THE DINOSAURS WERE REALLY TRULY WARM BLOODED 
WE MAY NEVER KNOW 
WHAT WE DO KNOW HOWEVER IS THAT DINOSAURS WERE EXTRAORDINARILY 
SUCCESSFUL AND DOMINATED THE EARTH FOR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION YEARS 
BUT THERE ARE SOME REPTILES TODAY THAT CAN KEEP THEIR BODY TEMPERATURE 
WELL ABOVE THAT OF THEIR SURROUNDINGS 
AND THESE ARE THE TRACKS OF ONE OF THEM 
THESE GIANTS HAUL THEMSELVES UP OUT OF THE SEA ALONG BEACHES LIKE THIS 
IN MANY PARTS OF THE TROPICS 
BUT IN ORDER NOT TO DISTURB THEM 
I'LL TURN THIS LIGHT OUT AND WE'LL LOOK FOR THEM WITH INFRARED CAMERAS 
LEATHERBACK TURTLES 
LIKE CROCODILES TURTLES ARE VERY ANCIENT CREATURES 
HAVING FIRST APPEARED AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS THE EARLY DINOSAURS 
TODAY LEATHERBACKS ARE THE BIGGEST OF ALL REPTILES 
AND THE MOST WIDELY DISTRIBUTED 
FOR THEY ARE FOUND ALL THE WAY FROM THESE WARM TROPICAL WATERS 
TO THE FREEZING SEAS OF THE ARCTIC 
THESE HAVE COME ASHORE ON A BEACH IN TRINIDAD 
WHERE ALMOST CERTAINLY THEY WERE HATCHED 
NOW THEY IN THEIR TURN ARE LAYING THEIR EGGS HERE 
LEATHERBACKS WE KNOW CAN GENERATE HEAT INTERNALLY 
AND THERE IS PROOF OF THAT IF YOU HAVE A LOOK AT HER EGGS 
THAT SHE IS LAYING RIGHT NOW ON THAT THERMAL CAMERA 
THEY ARE EMERGING FROM HER BODY 
AND LO AND BEHOLD THEY ARE BRIGHT YELLOW VERGING ON WHITE 
PROVING THAT THEY ARE WARMER THAN THEIR SURROUNDINGS 
SHE GENERATES THAT HEAT WITHIN HER BODY FROM SPECIAL DEPOSITS OF FAT 
SO THAT SHE CAN MAINTAIN HER INTERNAL BODY TEMPERATURE 
UP TO EIGHT C. ABOVE THAT OF THE WATER THROUGH WHICH SHE SWIMS 
AS SHE SWEEPS AWAY THE SURFACE SAND 
YOU CAN SEE THAT THE SAND TOO IS YELLOWER WARMER THAN THE OUTSIDE 
OF HER SHELL FOR IT STILL RETAINS THE HEAT IT ACQUIRED DURING THE DAY 
SO HOW DO LEATHERBACKS RETAIN 
THAT PRECIOUS AND EXPENSIVE INTERNALLY GENERATED HEAT 
WELL TO START WITH THEY HAVE THEIR HUGE SIZE TO HELP THEM 
THEY REALLY ARE MASSIVE ANIMALS 
THIS ONE IS GETTING ON FOR TWO METRES SIX FEET LONG 
AND THEY CAN GROW TO WEIGH A TONNE AND A HALF 
AND OF COURSE BIG OBJECTS RETAIN THEIR HEAT 
VERY MUCH MORE READILY THAN SMALL ONES DO 
AND THERE'S ANOTHER REASON 
NOW I AM BRIGHT YELLOW GOING INTO WHITE 
WHICH SHOWS THAT I'M LOSING A GREAT DEAL OF MY HEAT 
BUT SHE ON THE OTHER HAND IS VERY MUCH DARKER 
AND THAT IS BECAUSE SHE HAS AN INTERNAL LAYER OF FAT 
AN INSULATING LAYER JUST BENEATH THE SHELL WHICH WRAPS ROUND HER BODY 
THE LEATHERBACKS ARE THE ONLY REPTILES IN THE WORLD 
TO HAVE THIS KIND OF INSULATION 
HER EGGS LAID SHE FILLS IN THE HOLE WITH SAND 
AND NOW SHE'S ON HER WAY BACK TO THE SEA 
IT HAS AFTER ALL ENDURED FOR SOME THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION YEARS 
BUT HOW DID IT ALL BEGIN 
TO FIND THE ANSWER TO THAT WE HAVE TO GO BACK IN TIME 
AND BACK TO THE WATER 
TO THE AGE WHEN STRANGE FISH WERE HAULING THEMSELVES UP ONTO THE LAND 
FISH THAT WERE THE ANCESTORS OF THE AMPHIBIANS 
AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES ARE NOT EASY CREATURES TO FILM 
THEY CERTAINLY DO INTERESTING THINGS 
BUT THEY ALSO SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME DOING NOTHING MUCH 
WE NEEDED THE HELP OF SCIENTISTS WHO REALLY UNDERSTOOD THESE CREATURES 
SOME WORKERS HAVE SPENT OVER TWENTY YEARS STUDYING THEIR ANIMALS 
BOTH IN THE LAB AND IN THE FIELD 
THEY INVESTIGATE THE LIVES OF THEIR CHOSEN SPECIES 
USING ALL KINDS OF GEAR SOME SOPHISTICATED 
SOME PERHAPS LESS SO 
WITH THEIR HELP WE HAD A RARE CHANCE 
TO GET UNDER THE SKIN OF SOME OF OUR SUBJECTS 
MADAGASCAR WAS GOING TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT LOCATION FOR US 
IT'S A HUGE ISLAND ONE THOUSAND MILES LONG 
WITH A GREAT VARIETY OF HABITATS 
AND IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY RICH IN REPTILES 
I FIRST WENT TO MADAGASCAR BACK IN NINETEEN SIXTY 
FILMING FOR A SERIES CALLED ZOO QUEST 
BACK THEN I WAS TRYING TO FILM ALL KINDS OF CREATURES 
INCLUDING THE MONKEY LIKE LEMURS AND MANY RARE BIRDS 
BUT I WAS PARTICULARLY FASCINATED BY THE ISLAND'S CHAMELEONS 
THERE ARE IN FACT MORE SPECIES OF CHAMELEONS IN MADAGASCAR 
THAN IN ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD PUT TOGETHER 
THERE IS ONE THE PYGMY LEAF CHAMELEON 
WHICH WAS SAID TO BE ONLY AN INCH OR SO LONG 
I YEARNED TO SEE IT BUT I NEVER FOUND IT 
NOW I WAS BACK AND THIS TIME REPTILES WERE OUR SOLE SUBJECT 
ALTHOUGH MADAGASCAR IS ONLY SEPARATED 
FROM THE EAST COAST OF AFRICA BY THREE HUNDRED MILES OF SEA 
ITS PEOPLE AND PARTICULARLY ITS ANIMALS 
ARE VERY DIFFERENT INDEED FROM THOSE ON THE CONTINENT 
WITH HUNDRED OF SPECIES THAT ARE FOUND NOWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD 
ONCE AGAIN I WAS IN SEARCH OF CHAMELEONS 
THEN ALL TELEVISION WAS BLACK AND WHITE 
BUT NOW I COULD FILM AND RECORD CHAMELEONS IN COLOUR 
AND WHAT COLOURS THEY HAVE 
WE HAD COME IN THE RAINY SEASON 
WHEN MOST CREATURES INCLUDING REPTILES TEND TO BREED 
AND ARE THEREFORE PARTICULARLY ACTIVE AND INTERESTING 
AND THIS TIME I HAD THE HELP OF BERTRAND RAZAFIMAHATRATRA 
A MALAGASY NATURALIST WHO'S MADE A PARTICULAR STUDY OF CHAMELEONS 
HE'S WORKED ON THEM FOR OVER TEN YEARS 
AND KNOWS MOST KINDS VERY WELL 
I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE PYGMY SPECIES THAT HAD FASCINATED ME FOR SO LONG 
SO THAT REALLY IS FULL GROWN 
YES FULL GROWN 
BUT IT'S ONLY THAT BIG 
YES IT'S VERY SMALL 
HE SUGGESTED THAT ALTHOUGH CHAMELEONS 
ARE MOSTLY ACTIVE DURING THE DAY WE SHOULD LOOK FOR THEM AT NIGHT 
BECAUSE MOST OF THEM TURN PALE IN THE DARK 
AND ARE THEREFORE EASILY PICKED OUT IN THE LIGHT OF OUR TORCHES 
AH 
WHAT IS THAT 
WHAT SPECIES 
THIS IS OUSTELETS 
OUSTELETS 
AND MALE OR FEMALE 
FEMALE HOW DO YOU KNOW 
THE COLOUR 
OH THERE'S ANOTHER 
THIS ONE WAS FAR FROM UPSET AT BEING WOKEN UP 
AH 
IT FED 
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY 
IT CAN'T POSSIBLY FEED NORMALLY IN THE DARKNESS 
IT JUST TAKES ADVANTAGE OF OUR LIGHT AND FINDS AN INSECT BRAVO 
LET'S GO AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND MORE 
BERTRAND EXPLAINED THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER REASON 
WHY NIGHT WAS THE BEST TIME TO LOOK FOR CHAMELEONS 
WHEN THEY GO TO SLEEP THEY CLIMB TO THE VERY FAR END OF BRANCHES 
WHERE THEY'RE OUT OF THE WAY OF PREDATORS SUCH AS SNAKES 
AND OF COURSE THAT WAS WHERE WE FOUND THEM JUST AS HE SAID 
OH THAT'S A BIG ONE 
BEAUTIFUL 
THIS ONE IS JUST A BABY 
AND HOW OLD DO YOU THINK THAT IS 
I THINK JUST A FEW DAYS 
A FEW DAYS 
SO EVEN WHEN IT'S NEWLY HATCHED 
IT KNOWS TO COME TO THE END OF THE BRANCH 
YES YEAH 
LOOK THEY CHEW THE TIP OF THE BRANCH 
YES THEY'RE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET 
OF COURSE IF IT WAS IN THE DAY A BIRD COULD GET IT BUT AT NIGHT 
AT NIGHT SAFE 
BACK IN NINETEEN SIXTY MY CHAMELEON HUNTING TECHNIQUES WEREN'T QUITE SO EXPERT 
HOWEVER I DID DISCOVER THAT IF YOU PUT A STICK IN FRONT OF A CHAMELEON 
IT WILL USUALLY OBLIGINGLY WALK ONTO IT 
BUT NOW WITH BERTRAND AS MY GUIDE 
WE COULD SEARCH FOR THE WONDERFUL SPECIES I'D FAILED TO FIND BEFORE 
WOULD THEY BE DOWN HERE 
IT LIVES ON THE GROUND ALMOST INVISIBLE AMONG THE LEAF LITTER 
THAT 
BUT BERTRAND SPOTTED IT 
HOW EXTRAORDINARY 
THIS IS THE PYGMY LEAF CHAMELEON 
THE SMALLEST CHAMELEON IN THE WORLD 
IN THE WORLD AND PROBABLY THE SMALLEST REPTILES IN THE WORLD 
OF ANY KIND 
YOU KNOW I'D HEARD ABOUT THESE 
AND I WAS HERE IN MADAGASCAR 
FORTY SEVEN YEARS AGO 
AND I READ ABOUT THESE AND I NEVER SAW ONE 
AND I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE 
I NEVER KNEW THEY WERE AS SMALL AS THIS 
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY 
IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BLUEBOTTLE 
A BLOW FLY 
AND WHAT DOES IT FEED ON 
SMALL FLY SMALL FLIES 
HOW ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL 
I AM ASTONISHED 
THAT IS THE MOST MARVELLOUS THING I HAVE SEEN 
FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME 
FINDING THE PYGMY CHAMELEON WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE 
WITHOUT BERTRAND'S EXPERTISE AND SHARP EYES 
HE'S JUST ONE OF THE SCIENTISTS WHO HAS HELPED REVEAL TO US 
THE SECRET LIVES OF REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS
