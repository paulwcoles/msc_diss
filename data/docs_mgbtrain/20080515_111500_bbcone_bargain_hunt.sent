IN THE PICTURESQUE MARKET TOWN OF BRAMPTON 
BUT OUR TEAMS HAVE GOT NO TIME TO TAKE IN THE SIGHTS 
WITH JUST AN HOUR TO SCOUR THE ANTIQUES CENTRE 
EACH TEAM GETS THREE HUNDRED TO BUY THREE OBJECTS 
AND IF THEY MAKE A PROFIT AT AUCTION THEY GET TO KEEP IT 
THE EXPERTS WILL BE SPENDING THAT LEFT OVER LOLLY ON A BONUS BUY 
WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT MAKE THE DIFFERENCE 
ALL IN ALL IT'S JOLLY EXCITING 
LET'S GO AND MEET THE TEAMS

I THINK IT GIVES A GLINT IN YOUR EYE 
I'VE ALWAYS GOT A GLINT IN MY EYE 
IT SEEMS VERY CHEAP I THINK SO 
I WOULD BUY IT FOR THAT I WOULD I WOULD HAVE IT MYSELF 
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY FOR THAT IN AN AUCTION I WOULD SAY NINETY ONE HUNDRED 
GOODNESS ME SERIOUSLY IT IS A BARGAIN 
BUT WE TRY AND GET SOMETHING MORE OFF ABSOLUTELY WE ALWAYS DO THE CONVERSATION IS OVER 
IF YOU CAN GET IT ANY LESS THAN THAT ARE YOU UP FOR IT WE CERTAINLY ARE GO ON THEN 
THE BLING WAS BAGGED FOR A BARGAIN FORTY FIVE 
COME ON ANITA HURRY UP 
YOU GIRLS ARE RUNNING RINGS AROUND ME SLOW DOWN SLOW DOWN 
WHAT D'YOU THINK OF THIS 
EILEEN THIS IS A BOTTLE FIT FOR ALL THE PERFUMES OF ARABIA 
I LIKE IT I THINK IT'S GORGEOUS 
WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS A DOUBLE SCENT BOTTLE 
SO WE CAN HAVE TWO TYPES OF PERFUME 
THIS ONE HERE IS JUST A LITTLE CLIP LID AND YOU CAN OPEN IT LIKE THAT 
WE ARE MISSING A STOPPER THERE 
IT'S A PITY BUT IT IS NOT GOING TO MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE 
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THIS IS A SCREW TOP IT IS A DOUBLE BOTTLE 
WE WOULD HAVE ANOTHER TYPE OF PERFUME OR EAU DE COLOGNE IN THERE 
THE BOTTLE DATES FROM ABOUT THE MID EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS 
THAT'S OLDER THAN I THOUGHT 
IT'S AN OLDER ITEM 
WHAT YOU THINK OF IT JUNE I THINK IT'S REALLY SWEET AND I THINK IT'S ATTRACTIVE 
INITIALLY I WAS PUT OFF BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE CRANBERRY BUT IT GROWS ON YOU 
THE COLOUR OF THE GLASS WILL HELP WITH THE PRICE I'M SURE YOU ARE RIGHT 
EILEEN YOU JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH IT ABSOLUTELY 
ARE YOU A GIRL WHO LIKES WEARING PERFUME VERY MUCH SO 
I JUST LOVE SPLASHING IT ALL OVER 
I LIKE TO ROCK THE ROOM LIKE THE FRENCH PERFUME THAT ROCKS THE ROOM 
IN AUCTION THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO COLLECT SCENT BOTTLES 
PEOPLE WHO COLLECT CRANBERRY AND PEOPLE WHO COLLECT SMALL SILVER OBJECTS 
WE'VE GOT A THREE PRONGED ATTACK HERE SO A PRICE EILEEN 
THEY ARE ASKING SEVENTY TWO WHICH IS ABOUT THE RUN OF THE MILL PRICE NOW 
WE NEED TO GET IT DOWN I THINK SO 
IT'S UP TO YOU EILEEN DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO IT

EILEEN DEFINITELY ROCKED THE ROOM BUYING A SCENT BOTTLE FOR SIXTY FIVE 
FANCY A CHAT WITH SOME OTHER BARGAIN HUNT SURFERS 
THEN LOG ON TO OUR WEBSITE 
AND LOOK OUT FOR OUR MESSAGE BOARD 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'LL FIND ON IT RIGHT GUV'NOR 
DEBORAH DAVID WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS 
NICE PRETTY THING ISN'T IT 
I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT IS 
A PIECE OF BOHEMIAN GLASS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT LET'S CHECK IT OUT 
IT'S GOT TO BE HEAVY FIRST OF ALL WHICH IT IS 
BRILLIANT CUT BRIGHT COLOURS 
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT BOHEMIAN GLASS I DO N'T 
BUT I DO KNOW THAT IN A CARLISLE AUCTION A FEW WEEKS AGO 
TWO LARGE PIECES THAT WERE A PAIR 
SOLD FOR OVER ONE THOUSAND THEY CAN BRING BIG MONEY 
BOHEMIAN GLASS IS COLLECTED AGAIN BECAUSE OF ITS QUALITY 
BUT IT'S GOT TO BE IN MINT CONDITION REMEMBER THAT 
I HAD NOTICED THAT THERE IS A TINY TINY LITTLE CHIP 
ON THE TOP ON THE GILDING WELL UM 
IT'S GONNA HAVE AN EFFECT BUT NOT A MASSIVE ONE 
IT WOULDN'T HAVE AS BIG AN EFFECT FOR EXAMPLE IF IT WAS IN THE GLASS 
THAT COULD BE GILDED FOR THIRTY OR FORTY QUID AND NO ONE WOULD EVER KNOW 
HOW OLD IS IT DO YOU FEEL I REALLY DON'T KNOW 
I THINK LOOKING AT THE COLOURS AND THE GILDING 
ONE MIGHT DESCRIBE THAT AS EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY THEY DO SELL FOR BIG MONEY 
THEY CAN DO PARTICULARLY IN PAIRS AS YOU'VE SAID 
PRICE WISE FOR THIS ONE THE TICKET PRICE SAYS ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE 
ANYONE WHO HASN'T GOT A ONE THOUSAND BUDGET 
AND WANTS SOMETHING EXTREMELY NICE EXTREMELY PRETTY 
AND GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY I THINK IT WOULD BE A WINNER 
I THINK IT'S LOVELY I REALLY DO 
I DIDN'T NOTICE THE NIBBLE UNTIL YOU PICKED IT OUT 
BUT I THINK THE GILDING ON IT THE COLOUR AND THE WEIGHT 
I THINK IT'S LOVELY WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'LL MAKE AT AUCTION 
I THINK IT WILL BE 
OVER THE TWO HUNDRED AND UNDER THE THREE HUNDRED 
YOU TWO ARE GOING TO MAKE A FORTUNE THE WAY YOU'RE SPEAKING 
THE BOHEMIAN VASE WAS BOUGHT FOR A WHOPPING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT 
AW THAT'S GORGEOUS 
YOU KNOW JULIA I CAN SEE YOU WITH A LITTLE BLACK DRESS 
WEARING THIS CRESCENT BROOCH ON THE LAPEL OH I'D LOVE IT 
EVERY GIRL SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE BLACK DRESS EXACTLY 
IT'S A QUALITY ITEM I KNEW I HAD A COUPLE OF CLASSY BIRDS HERE 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE BACK 
THE BACK OF IT TELLS US A LOT 
NOW IT'S FIFTEEN CARAT GOLD 
AND THE PIN IS BEAUTIFULLY SHAPED TO FOLLOW THAT CRESCENT ISN'T THAT LOVELY 
IF WE TURN IT BACK ROUND

LITTLE MOTIF UP HERE ZIGZAG 
I THINK THIS BROOCH HAS EVERYTHING GOING FOR IT 
THAT'S SUPER 
TELL ME WHY YOU LIKE IT 
IT'S SO ELEGANT AND SO STYLISH 
I KNOW IF I WAS WEARING IT I WOULD FEEL SO GOOD IN IT 
LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS ABSOLUTELY 
EILEEN WHAT ABOUT YOU IT'S GROWING ON ME BUT IT WASN'T THE FIRST THING I'D HAVE CHOSEN FOR MYSELF 
BUT I LIKE THE DAINTINESS OF IT AND THE PEARLS 
THE WHOLE DESIGN IS PRETTY GOOD HOW MUCH IS THE BROOCH 
I'M AFRAID I ALWAYS GO FOR EXPENSIVE ITEMS 
IT IS ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN WHAT DO YOU YOU THINK 
I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY WORTH ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING THERE WE'VE GOT QUALITY CONDITION 
BUT WE REALLY WANT TO GET IT DOWN FOR THE PURPOSES OF SELLING IN AUCTION 
WE LIKE IT AND LET'S HOPE THERE ARE OTHER CLASSY BIRDS AT THE AUCTION 
THE CLASSY BIRDS BARGAINED THE BROOCH DOWN TO ONE HUNDRED 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS THEN 
WHAT IS IT IT'S A BEAVER MUFF 
OH DEAR JUNE I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL

WHAT DO YOU THINK BLUE AND WHITE IS ALWAYS POPULAR 
AND YOU'LL ALWAYS GET FOLK WHO COLLECT THAT TYPE OF WARE 
NICE FLOWER DECORATION GOOD CONDITION 
THE GLAZE IS VERY FRESH WE HAVE ALL THESE POSITIVE ASPECTS 
IF WE LOOK AT THE BACK IT'S LOSOL WARE 
WHICH WAS ONE OF THE STAFFORDSHIRE FACTORIES 
JACOBEAN PATTERN MADE PERHAPS END OF THE NINETEENTH EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY 
WHAT'S THAT DO YOU SEE

ANY SIGNS OF A BENSON STAMP NOT THAT I CAN FIND 
BUT THEY ARE IN THE STYLE YOU LOVE THEM

OR THEY BOTH HAVE A HOOK ON WHICH I THINK YOU COULD USE AS A FIRE BASKET 
SHE IS VERY GOOD BANG ON 
LET ME TEST YOU DATE 
I THINK THEY'RE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
WHERE IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY YOU'VE GOT ONE HUNDRED YEARS WINDOW THERE

I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'LL MAKE A PROFIT HOW MUCH ARE THEY THE TICKET PRICE IS SIXTY NINE

WONDERFUL YES YOU DON'T

THEY'RE A DECORATOR'S DREAM IF YOU CAN GET THEM FOR SIXTY 
I THINK THEY'RE A BARGAIN FABULOUS QUALITY THEY WEIGH A TON

BUT I THINK IN THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT THEY COULD LOOK A MILLION QUID'S WORTH 
IT'S GOT A SCREW THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO IT HOW DO YOU KNOW 
COS IT'S A NEW SCREW 
I'M REALLY SORRY DEBORAH 
BUT I THINK THESE ARE HORRID 
IT'S NOT MY DECISION GUYS IS IT 
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO 
EVERYTHING I BUY AT AUCTION TURNS OUT TO BE WORTH NOTHING 
EVERYTHING MY DAUGHTER BUYS TURNS OUT TO BE FANTASTIC

BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING OFF THE PRICE 
WE'LL SEE WHO'S RIGHT AT THE AUCTION 
TIME'S UP LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE TEAMS HAVE BOUGHT 
FIRST UP FOR THE REDS THEIR EIGHTEEN CARAT DIAMOND RING

BOHEMIAN VASE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY

I'VE GOT MY EYE ON SOMETHING A BIT CHANCY A BIT RISKY 
IT MAY NOT BE EVERYBODY'S CUP OF TEA 
BUT IT MIGHT BE AN INTERIOR DESIGNER'S DREAM 
WE'LL LEAVE IT IN YOUR HANDS NOW LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE BLUES BOUGHT 
THEY STARTED WITH A VICTORIAN SCENT BOTTLE 
WILL IT BRING THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS AT THE AUCTION 
THE EDWARDIAN CRESCENT BROOCH WAS BOUGHT FOR ONE HUNDRED 
FINALLY LET'S HOPE THAT ERIC HAS SOME OTHER UNCLES 
AT THE AUCTION IN NEED OF A DISH 
YOU SEEMED TO HAVE FUN WE HAD A WONDERFUL DAY 
WHICH IS YOUR FAVOURITE PIECE 
I THINK THE CRESCENT BROOCH WAS THE ONE WE DECIDED WAS THE MOST LIKELY TO MAKE A GOOD PROFIT 
DO YOU LIKE IT TOO IT'S MY FAVOURITE 
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY PEACHY YOU SPENT ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE WHICH IS GOOD GOING 
ONE HUNDRED FIVE WORTH OF LEFTOVER LOLLY GOING TO WEE ANITA 
WITH THIS I'M GOING TO LADLE IN THE PROFITS 
LADLE IN THE PROFITS AAH THERE COULD BE A LITTLE SUBTLE HINT THERE 
FOR ME I'M OFF FOR A STROLL TO NORTHUMBERLAND 
THIS IS WALLINGTON HOUSE IN NORTHUMBRIA 
REBUILT BY SIR WALTER BLACKETT IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY 
HOWEVER MODERN WALLINGTON IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TREVELYAN FAMILY 
APPARENTLY RENOWNED FOR THE LENGTH OF THEIR NOSES AND THE BREADTH OF THEIR OPINIONS 
WHEN SIR JOHN TREVELYAN GOT MARRIED 
HIS WIFE MARIA BROUGHT A LARGE AND IMPRESSIVE DOWRY WITH HER 
INCLUDED IN THIS WAS A MAGNIFICENT COLLECTION OF PORCELAIN 
NOW ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COLLECTIONS OF CERAMICS 
OWNED BY THE NATIONAL TRUST 
THE COLLECTION IS IMPORTANT AT WALLINGTON 
BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS AN INCREDIBLE CROSS SECTION OF PERIODS AND STYLES 
SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS HERE HAVE ADDED TO THE COLLECTION 
PROBABLY THE OLDEST PIECE IS THIS GORGEOUS BLUE AND WHITE CHARGER 
WHICH IS EARLY MING 
AND DATES FROM THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY 
I PARTICULARLY LOVE IT FOR ITS SIMPLICITY 
THESE STYLISED PEONIES PAINTED ON THIS LOVELY WHITE GROUND 
IT'S CALLED IN THE FAMILY THE LUCKNOW CHARGER 
BECAUSE SIR CHARLES EDWARD TREVELYAN WHO YOU SEE IN THAT PORTRAIT 
WAS IN THE INDIAN CIVIL SERVICE 
AROUND THE TIME OF THE INDIAN MUTINY IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN 
AND LET US SAY HE ACQUIRED IT 
IT'S SUPPOSED TO COME FROM THE COLLECTION OF THE GREAT MOGUL INDIAN EMPEROR SHAH JAHAN 
NOW THIS BOWL HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH CHINA 
AT LEAST NOT THE COUNTRY CHINA 
IT'S ACTUALLY MADE OF EARTHENWARE 
AND IS TIN GLAZED TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE CHINESE WHITE PORCELAIN 
IF YOU LOOK IN THE CENTRE IT'S ENAMELLED WITH A FIGURE OF BACCHUS 
ASTRIDE A BARREL HOLDING ALOFT A GLASS AND A DECANTER 
AND WHAT HE'S DOING IS INVITING YOU TO DRINK 
BECAUSE THIS THING IS A PUNCH BOWL 
AND IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY 
IT SAYS LET US DRINK SUCCESS TO BLACKETT AND FENWICK 
BECAUSE IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY ONE THERE WAS AN ELECTION 
THE IDEA BEING IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WHEN THERE WERE VERY FEW VOTERS 
FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED IN THIS INSTANCE WAS TO LASH THEM UP 
AND MAYBE THEY'D VOTE FOR YOU WELL IT WORKED FOR BLACKETT 
BECAUSE HE WAS ELECTED 
NOW THESE CHAPS ARE FUN 
THEY COME FROM THE BOW FACTORY IN THE EAST END OF LONDON 
BOW WAS FOUNDED IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY TWO BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY NINE 
THAT THEY STARTED ADDING BONEMEAL LITERALLY CALCIFIED ANIMAL BONES 
INTO THEIR MIX OF CERAMICS AND HENCE THE TERM ENGLISH BONE CHINA 
THESE FELLOWS REPRESENT STROLLING PLAYERS 
FROM THE COMMEDIA DELL'ARTE 
THIS FELLOW IS HARLEQUIN AND THIS FELLOW PULCINELLO 
LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE MR. PUNCH FROM TODAY'S PUNCH AND JUDY SHOWS 
THAT'S NO COINCIDENCE BECAUSE MR. PUNCH IS BASED ON HIM 
THEY'RE SET OUT ON AN OVAL MIRRORED PLATTER LIKE THIS 
BECAUSE VERY OFTEN IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
PORCELAIN FIGURES WOULD BE ARRANGED AND PLAYED WITH BY GUESTS 
DURING THE DINNER AND THE MIRROR GIVES A DIFFERENT SENSE OF PROPORTION TO THE FIGURES 
SHALL WE ENACT A LITTLE PLAY BETWEEN OUR STREET PLAYERS 
DO YOU THINK THE BARGAIN HUNTERS TODAY WILL MAKE A PROFIT 
ARE MY TROUSERS PATCHWORK OF COURSE 
DREAM ON MR. HARLEQUIN 
WE'RE AT THE CUMBRIA AUCTION ROOMS IN CARLISLE 
WITH PAUL LAIDLAW THE AUCTIONEER HELLO THERE GOOD TO SEE YOU 
NOW DEBORAH AND JUNE WENT WITH THIS PLATINUM AND DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING 
ARE THEY DIAMONDS THEY ARE YES 
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT THERE THAT'S A COMMERCIAL LOT 
HOW DO YOU BUY THAT FOR FORTY FIVE IF IT'S DIAMONDS AND PLATINUM 
I THINK YOU WERE BEING LOOKED AFTER THERE YOU RECKON 
WELL IT IS PRETTY CHEAP I'D HAVE THOUGHT YEAH ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT LOVELY 
CHEAP AS INEXPENSIVE FRIED POTATOES PERHAPS WHAT'S YOUR ESTIMATE EIGHTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
REALLY THAT'S GOOD MIGHT BE DOUBLING THEIR MONEY ON THAT 
THAT'D BE A GREAT START WOULDN'T IT JUST 
HIDEOUS COPPER AND BRASS AND IRON THINGS WORK WENT INTO THEM 
THERE'D BE MORE WORK GOING INTO CLEANING THEM CLEARLY THEY'RE PART OF SOMETHING GREATER 
I CAN'T FATHOM THEM THEY'RE HALF ORNAMENTS 
SO YOU REGARD IT AS PART OF SOMETHING ELSE AND THEREFORE NOT WORTH A LOT THIRTY TO FIFTY 
THIRTY TO FIFTY VERY GOOD THEY PAID SIXTY 
THAT IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT WE NEED SOME LUCK THERE 
NEXT IS THIS OVERLAID BLUE VASE 
THEY PAID ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FOR IT 
YIKES YOU LOOK A BIT SHOCKED THERE 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS SOLD AS 
BUT THERE'S NOT THE AGE TO JUSTIFY THAT PRICE 
I THINK THAT'S RELATIVELY MODERN DO YOU IT MAY HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AS BOHEMIAN I THINK IT'S TWENTIETH CENTURY 
COULD BE POST WAR RIGHT IT'S MORE LIKELY 
IT'S WORSE THAN THAT TIM THERE'S A CHIP YES 
I THINK IF THERE WAS MUCH VALUE IN IT THE CHIP TOOK THAT AWAY YES 
IT'S ALL DOWN TO INEXPENSIVE FRIED POTATOES AGAIN 
ANYWAY HOW MUCH FOR IT TWENTY TO FORTY WOULD BE ENOUGH THEY PAID ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
THAT IS A HUGE HOLE INDEED THEY'RE GOING TO NEED THEIR BONUS BUY 
SO YOU GIRLS SPENT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE YES 
FORTY FIVE WENT TO DAVID WHAT DID YOU SPEND IT ON 
A BIG LUMP OF FLASH FOR VERY LITTLE CASH 
NOW THAT'S A PIECE OF INTERIOR DESIGN KIT IF EVER I'VE SEEN IT 
THE GIRLS ARE OBVIOUSLY KEEN AREN'T YOU HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR IT 
FORTY FIVE YOU WERE ROBBED

WHAT IS IT MADE OF I DON'T KNOW PROBABLY CONCRETE 
YOU'VE SPENT FORTY FIVE ON A PIECE OF CONCRETE 
I'VE SPENT MORE ON WORSE I ASSURE YOU BUT IT'S THE LOOK 
IT'S GOT THE DESIGN LOOK BUT DAVID IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S DIED 
IT'S AWFUL 
WHAT'S YOUR PREDICTION AS TO WHAT IT'LL BRING IN THIS SALE ROOM DAVID 
WELL TWO INTERIOR DESIGNERS WOULD FIGHT OVER IT IF WE GET THEM HERE 
PERSONALLY I'D PAY ONE HUNDRED FOR IT IF I WAS DOING SOMEONE'S HOUSE IT WOULD BE A GREAT BIT OF KIT 
POTENTIALLY UP TO ONE HUNDRED THEN BETWEEN FORTY FIVE AND ONE HUNDRED WITH THE RIGHT GUY YEAH O. K. FINE 
FAIR ENOUGH YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE IT YOU HAVE TO TRUST DAVID 
AND YOUR DECISION WILL BE MADE AFTER THE SALE OF YOUR FIRST THREE ITEMS 
YOU AT HOME WHAT DOES THE AUCTIONEER THINK OF DAVID'S BUST 
IT'S A WACKY OLD THING THIS ISN'T IT IT'S A DECORATOR'S PIECE 
BUT A DECORATOR WHO WANTS A MUG SHOT OF SOME OLD CODGER IN A MODERN INTERIOR 
IT DOESN'T APPEAL TO ME I MUST SAY NOR I THERE'S TALENT BEHIND IT 
YES DEFINITELY WE DON'T KNOW THE SITTER WE DON'T KNOW THE SCULPTOR IT'S DODGY ON ITS PLINTH 
WHAT'S IT WORTH I THINK IT'S TEN TO TWENTY WHAT CAN I SAY
