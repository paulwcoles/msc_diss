GOOD MORNING 
THOUSANDS OF ELEVEN YEAR OLDS 
ACROSS ENGLAND BEGIN SITTING THEIR 
NATIONAL TESTS TODAY BUT COMPLAINTS 
ABOUT THE STANDARD ASSESSMENT TESTS 
ARE CONTINUING TO GROW TEACHERS 
ARGUE THEY ARE SQUEEZING SOME 
SUBJECTS OUT OF THE CURRICULUM AND 
PARENTS WORRY THEY ARE PUTTING TOO 
MUCH PRESSURE ON PUPILS 
A TESTING WEEK FOR PUPILS EVERY 
DAY ELEVEN YEAR OLDS IN ENGLAND 
WILL BE SITTING NATIONAL TESTS IN 
MATHS ENGLISH AND SCIENCE BUT NOW 
THE THE TEST TO THEMSELVES ARE 
UNDER SCRUTINY ACCUSED OF HARMING 
CHILDREN'S EDUCATION IN AL PAN A 
PANORAMA PROGRAMME PUPILS WERE 
ASKED WHAT S. A. T.'S REMINDED THEM OFF 
AND DREW MONTH MONSTERS 
I FEEL THAT S. A. T.'S ARE MONSTERS 
HIS NAME IS THE THE THE S. A. T. 
WATCHERS WATCHERS TEACHERS AND SOME PARENTS DEMRAIND 
THE TESTS NARROW THE CURRICULUM 
TOMORROW A COMMITTEE OF M. P.'S WILL 
DELIVER THEIR JUDGEMENT AND ARE 
EXPECTED TO BE CRITICAL 
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE 
AMOUNT OF TESTING AND ASSESSMENT 
THAT WE'RE DOING THE QUALITY OF 
THE TESTING AND ASSESSMENT THAT 
WE'RE DOING AND THE UNSEEN 
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT TESTING ON THE 
WHOLE SCHOOL CULTURE 
THE GOVERNMENT IS PILOTING WAYS OF 
PREDOUSING THE PRESSURE OF TESTS 
BUT INSISTS SOME MEASURE OF PUPILS 
AND SCHOOLS PERFORMANCE IS VITAL 
I LOOK AT ALL OF THE EVIDENCE 
INCLUDING WHAT TEACHERS TELL US AND 
I THINK WE HAVE GOT THE RIGHT 
POLICY IN TERMS OF OF TESTING AND 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT POLICY 
EVOLVING EVOLVING WHILE THERE IS OPPOSITION IN THE 
EDUCATION EDUCATION WORLD TESTS AT 
ELEVEN REMAIN POPULAR WITH PARENTS 
AND A KEY GOVERNMENT POLICY WILL 
ADJUST WITH CAUTION 
POLICE INVESTIGATING THE MURDER OF 
A TEENAGER IN LONDON SAYS A 
SIGNIFICANT WITNESS HAS COME

IN A BAKER'S SHOP IN LEE ON 
SATURDAY MORNING 
CLOSE TO THE SPOT WHERE JIMMY MIZEN 
WAS MURDERED AL GATHERING OF 
REMEMBRANCE A CHANCE FOR A 
COMMUNITY TO COME TOGETHER AND 
EXPRESS THEIR GRIEF FOR A BOY WHO

JIMMY HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS A CARE 
FREE TEENAGER A SIX FOOT GENTLE 
GIANT WELL KNOWN AND WELL LIKE 
POLICE SAY HE WAS ATTACKED AFTER 
REFUSING TO TAKE PART IN A FIGHT AT 
THE LOCAL BAKERS HIS PARENTS SAY 
IT WAS TYPICAL OF HIM TO AVOID 
TROUBLE TROUBLE JIMMY WAS THE SWEETEST BOY YOU 
COULD EVER MEET JUST A FINE YOUNG 
MAN HAPPY ALL THE TIME 
WHISTLED AS HE WALKED DOWN THE ROAD 
POLICE ARE CLEAR THAT THE ATTACK 
THAT TOOK PLACE INSIDE THE BAKER 
WAS NOT GANG RELATED 
THIS IS ABOUT A VERY VIOLENT 
EXCESSIVE USE OF VIOLENCE 
UNPROVOKED ATTACK ON A DESCENT 
YOUNG MAN 
AND FOR THE SAKE OF THE FAMILY AND 
THIS INVESTIGATION I WOULD LIKE 
PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD WITH 
INFORMATION 
JIMMY IS THE THIRTEENTH INFORMATION TEENAGER TO BE MURDER INDEED LONDON 
THIS YEAR HIS FATHER IS BEWILDER 
THAT SUCH VIOLENCE COULD TAKE HIS 
SON SON IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONCERN OF 
MINE DO I TEACH MY SONS TO BE 
STREET CRED ETCETERA BUT I 
THOUGHT NO THERE IS A DESCENT WAY 
OF LIVING AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE 
TAUGHT I FEEL IN SENSE IT HAS 
COME HOME TO ROAST HERE 
ROOST HERE 
THE FIRST AMERICAN AID FLIGHT IS 
BEING ALLOWED INTO BURMA BRINGING 
HELP TO THE SUR VIRES OF THE 
SURVIVORS OF CYCLONE 
THE FLOW OF AID HAS BEEN HAMPERED 
BY THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES ONE 
RELIEF AGENCY DESCRIBED THE 
SITUATION AS BEING LIKE A TICKING 
TIMEBOMB TIMEBOMB ANDREW HARDING JOINS US FROM 
THAILAND THAILAND WE HAVE HAD UN AID FLIGHTS WHAT 
DIFFERENCE WILL THIS U. S. AID FLIGHT 
MAKE MAKE THE HONEST TRUTH 
IS NOT LOT THIS IS VERY MUCH TEST FLIGHT BY THE 
AMERICANS HAD GOT A LOT OF 
EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT ON BOARD THEN 
YESTERDAY WE UNDERSTOOD THEY HEARD 
THAT INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO HAND 
THE SUPPLIES ON THE GROUND AT 
RANGOON AIRPORT TO ANOTHER N. G. O. SAVE 
THE CHILDREN THE BURMESE MILITARY 
WERE GOING TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE 
SUPPLIES AT THAT POINT THEY OFF 
LOADED SOME EQUIPMENT THEY ARE 
SENDING IN WATER AND MASS KEET KEET 
OWE MOSQUITO NETS AND BANQUET IT 
IS A TEST RUN THEY ARE SEEING IF 
THEY LET IT GET OUT INTO THE DELTA 
FAST IF THAT HAPPENS THEY WILL 
SEND MORE FLIGHTS TOMORROW 
HOW REAL IS THE RISK OF DISEASE 
AFTER DISASTERS LIKE THIS THE AID 
AGENCIES ARE ALWAYS SAYING THAT 
THERE WILL BE FURTHER DEATHS 
BECAUSE OF THE RISK OF DEATHS FROM 
CHOLERA AND DYSENTERY WHAT'S IT 
LOOKING LIKE 
WE ARE HITTING THAT 
TIME WHEN AID AGENCIES AND EXPERTS 
SAY THIS IS WHEN YOU START TO SEE 
PEOPLE DYING OF DYSENTERY AND OF 
CHOLERA AND TYPHOID AND WE HAVE HAD 
UNCONFIRMED REPORTS OF THOSE 
DISEASES BREAKING OUT L. SAW A 
PICTURE OF A SIX YEAR OLD BOY WHO 
DIED OF A FEVER BEING BURIED HIS 
BROTHER HAD BEEN KILLED IN THE 
INITIAL CYCLONE WE WILL SEE MORE 
OF THOSE DEATHS VERY SOON 
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE 
THERE IS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLINE 
PEOPLE ARE BEING ASKED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT TOR THEIR VIEWS ON WHO 
SHOULD PAY FOR LONG TERM CARE FOR 
THE ELDERLY AND DISABLED IN ENGLAND 
GORDON BROWN WILL OUTLINE THE NEED 
TO REFORM SOCIAL CARE HE WILL SAY 
MAKING THE SYSTEM BETTER FAIRER 
AND AFFORDABLE IS ONE OF THE MOST 
IMPORTANT CHALLENGES FACING 
MINISTERS MINISTERS CRITICS SAY THEY ARE MONSTROUS 
THEIR SUPPORTERS SAY THEY ARE VITAL 
FOR PROGRESS THE GOVERNMENT'S 
PROPOSED NEW FERTILITY LAWS WILL BE 
DEBATED BY M. P.'S TODAY AND THE BILL 
COULD ALLOW THE CREATION OF HYBRID 
HUMAN ANIMAL EMBRYOS HERE IS 
PALLAB GHOSH 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT THE BILL 
SIMPLY UPDATES LEGISLATION PASSED 
NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AGO TO TAKE INTO 
ACCOUNT ADVANCE INS SCIENCE AND 
CHANGES IN SOCIAL ATTITUDESMENT ONE 
SUCH ADD HAS HAS BEEN THE ADVENT TO 
CREATE TISSUE SIBLINGSMENT THIS 
COUPLE WON THE RIGHT TO HAVE A 
CHILD WHO WAS AN EXACT TISSUE MATCH 
FOR THEIR SON WHO RUFRS FROM A RARE 
BLOOD DISORDER AT THE TIME THE 
DECISION WAS LEGAL AND ETHICAL 
GREY AREA THE NEW LEGISLATION 
WOULD ALLOW MORE CASES ANOTHER ADD 
RANCE IS THE SABLET TO CREATE 
ABILITY TO CREATE HYBRID EMBRYOS 
THESE WERE PRODUCED LAST MONTH BY 
RESEARCHERS IN NEWCASTLE THEY ARE 
NINETY NINE POINT NINE PER CENT HUMAN BUT CONTAIN TINY 
AMOUNT OF ANIMAL D. N. A. 
SCIENTISTS SAY THEY NEED TO CREATE 
HYBRIDS BECAUSE THERE IS A SHORTAGE 
OF HUMAN EGGS 
SOME M. P.'S ALSO WANT TO PROPOSE 
AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL TO REDUCE 
THE UPPER LIMIT FOR ABORTION 
MINISTERS SAY THAT OPPOSITION TO 
THEIR BILL WOULD HOLD BACK MEDICAL 
RESEARCH CRITICS SAY IT IS IMMORAL 
THIS BILL WILL MAKE THIS COUNTRY 
OUT OF STEP WITH OTHER COUNTRIES 
WE ARE IN DANGER OF BECOMING AN 
UNETHICAL ROGUE STATE LEGISLATING 
FOR AREAS WHICH ARE PROHIBITED BY 
MANY OTHER COUNTRIES 
THE BILL HAS THE BALANCE RIGHT 
BETWEEN THE NEED TO ENSURE RESPECT 
FOR THE EMBRYO SO IT IS NOT 
TREATED AS ANY OLD GROUP OF CELLS 
BUT THE NEED TO ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE 
INTO SERIOUS DISEASES 
M. P.'S WILL HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER THE 
BILL LEGITIMISES PRACTISES THAT 
HAVE GONE TOO FAR OR PAVES WAY 
FOR BETTER MEDICAL RESEARCH AND 
FERTILITY TREATMENTS 
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE BEING TARGETED BY 
COMPANIES OFFERING EASY LOANS 
THROUGH FACEBOOK 
THAT'S ACCORDING TO CREDIT ACTION 
WHICH HAS COMPLAINED TO THE OFFICE 
OF FAIR TRADING ABOUT THE ADVERTS 
WHICH PROMISE LOANS FOR PEOPLE WITH 
A POOR CREDIT RATING 
IT SAYS MANY ADS BREAK THE LAW 
BECAUSE THEY DON'T GIVE DETAILS OF 
INTEREST RATES 
NEARLY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE STRIPPED OFF AT 
AN AUSTRIAN FOOTBALL STADIUM IN THE

I THINK FERGIE WAS HAPPY THE MOOD 
WAS DIFFERENT AT STAMFORD BRIDGE

FRONT OF THE GUARDIAN 
THE MAIN STORY THAT THAT M. P.'S WILL

DRUG THEY SAY THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT 
NOT ONLY WHETHER IT WORKS WHETHER 
IT IS VALUE FOR MONEY THEY TALK TO 
PATIENTS AND DOCTORS AND OUT OF ALL 
THE CANCER DRUGS THEY ASSESS THEY

GREATEST ESCAPES IN PREMIER LEAGUE 
HISTORY THEY WON FOUR OUT OF THEIR 
LAST FIVE MATCHES TO STAY IN THE 
DIVISION DANNY MURPHY'S GOAL GAVE

SO IT IS HARRODS HAMPERS ALL AROUND 
COURTESY OF THE CLUB'S CHAIRMAN 
LUCKILY DANNY MURPHY CAME TO OUR

DISCUSSING OUR FUTURE IN THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP I'M THE LUCKY ONE AND 
THEY'RE THE UNLUCKY ONES A A MISERABLE END TO THE SEASON FOR 
STEVE COPPELL'S SIDE

NOW TIED FOR SECOND PLACE IN THE

GARCIA WON IT ON THE LAST HOLE 
AFTER THEY FINISHED TIED ON FIVE 
UNDER PAR 
THAT'S IT 
THERE COULD HAVE BEEN MORE RUGBY 
AND MOTOR RACING 
PICTURE OF THAT BOY CRYING THERE 
IS NOTHING WORSE IN SPORT THAN 
WATCHING YOUR SIDE GET RELEGATED 
JTS 
I HAVE BEEN THERE JTS IT IS A LONG SLOW AND PAINFUL 
SEASON 
IT IS THAT TIME OF YEAR WHEN 
SCHOOLCHILDREN ACROSS ENGLAND WILL 
BE GAZING OUT OF THEIR WINDOWS AT 
THE BUL WEATHER AND KNUCKLING DOWN 
TO REVISE FOR EXAMS OR DOING EXAMS 
ARE WE PUTTING TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON 
OUR CHILDREN AT TOO YOUNG AN AGE TO 
PERFORM IN TESTS THAT'S THE 
QUESTION BEING ASKED BY PANORAMA 
IT ASKED A GROUP OF ELEVEN YEAR 
OLDS TO DRAW A CHARACTER 
REPRESENTING THE EXAMS THEY WILL 
SIT THIS WEEK AND THE RESULTS WERE 
SCARY SCARY MY NAME IS BRAINY THE CHEAT ERASER 
IF YOU TRY AND RUNAWAY THEN I'LL 
CATCH YOU WITH MY TONGUE AND WRAP 
MY TONGUE AROUND YOU SO YOU WON'T 
GO ANYWHERE 
I CALLED HER S. A. T. MONTH MONTH TER 
BECAUSE I FEEL THAT S. A. T.'S ARE MONTH 
TER WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE S. A. T.'S 
YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR BRAIN 
THE S. A. T. WATCHER RIPS YOUR BODY IN 
HALF AND EATS YOUR GUTS IF YOU'VE 
BEEN REALLY REALLY BAD 
HE LOVES INSECTS AND FLIES AROUND 
LAURA WARREN 
IS PARENT AND WITH IS THE NATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF PARENT TEACHERS 
WHAT ARE THE TEACHERS SAYING ABOUT 
S. A. T.'S 
WHEN IT CAME TO THE ELEVEN PLUS S. A. T.'S THEY WEREN'T GIVING US AS MUCH 
REVISION AS THEY ARE FOR THE S. A. T.'S 
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT IS FAIR 
BECAUSE IT COULD CHANGE OUR LIFE 
PRETTY MUCH 
COULD IT LAURA HOW MUCH AFFECT ON 
A CHILD'S EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT 
DO S. A. T.'S REALLY HAVE 
WELL INTERESTINGLY SURVEYS THAT 
WE'VE UNDER TAKEN SHOW US THAT WHAT 
PARENTS REALLY WANT TO KNOW IS 
THEIR OWN CHILD'S PROGRESS AND IF 
THERE IS ANY GAPS OR IF THERE ARE 
SUPPORT THEY MIGHT NEED AREAS THEY 
ARE STRUGGLING WITH THAT'S WHAT 
PARENTS WANT TO UNDERSTAND FROM ANY 
TESTING OF THEIR CHILDRENMENT THEIR 
INTEREST AS HOW THEIR CHILD 
MEASURES GO AGAINST THE NATIONAL 
ARCHING IT IS PROBABLY ONLY TWENTY PER CENT 
THE BULK OF WHAT PARENTS WANT TO 
UNDERSTAND FROM UNDERSTANDING THEIR 
CHILD'S LEVEL IS A ONE TO ONE 
DISCUSSION WITH THEIR CHILD'S 
TEACHER ABOUT THEIR CHILD AND WHAT 
THEIR CHILD NEEDS 
WHAT DO YOU TELL HER ABOUT THE 
IMPORTANCE OF THESE EXAMS 
FOR US 
AS A FAMILY IT IS ABOUT AMELIA 
WILL ALWAYS TRY HER HARDEST BUT I 
EXPECT THAT OF HER EVERY DAY AT 
SCHOOL SCHOOL JUST DO AS WELL YOU CAN 
IT IS FINE 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW EVERYBODY IS 
DIFFERENT AND EVERY DAY IS 
DIFFERENT REALLY THAT'S WHAT THE 
MAJORITY OF PARENTS EXPECT WE 
EXPECT OUR CHILDREN JUST TO TRY 
THEIR HARDEST AND AS YOU SAY 
WHATEVER THAT IS IT IS SUPER 
AMELIA YOU FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT 
THEM WHAT ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS AND 
CLASSMATES HOW ARE THEY FEELING 
ABOUT THE S. A. T.'S 
SOME ARE GETTING 
QUITE STRESSED AND WORRIED WHEREAS 
SOME OTHER CHILDREN AREN'T THAT 
BOTHERED BOTHERED IT IS THE START OF LONG ROAD OF 
EXAMS IN ONE SENSE IT IS GOOD 
PRACTISE BUT ON THE OTHER OTHER 
HANDSOME ACHILDREN ARE TOO YOUNG 
YOU THINK YOU ARE TOO YOUNG WELL WELL SOME ARE NEEDED SOME THERE ARE NO 
NEED TO BE TAKEN BECAUSE IT IS 
STRESSING THEM FOR A LONG TIME 
AND CHILDREN ARE ASSESSED 
CONTINUALLY ANYWAY THAT'S WHAT WE 
LOSE SIGHT OF THEY'RE WELL AWARE 
OF WHAT THEY'RE WORKING TO AND 
PERHAPS WHERE THEIR HANDWRITING 
NEEDS TO IMPROVE OR THEIR SPELLING 
OR PERHAPS AN ASPECT OF NUMERACY 
NEEDS TO BE WORKED ON CHILDREN ARE 
WELL AWARE 
IT IS ALL DOWN TO THE APPROACH OF 
THE TEACHERS IF YOU HAVE GOT GOOD 
TEACHERS YOU CALM THE CHILDREN 
DON'T AND DON'T HYPE UP THE THE 
EXPECTATION EXPECTATION CHILDREN ARE GETTING THAT SUPPORT 
FROM THE WHOLE AREA 
SO MUCH DOES DEPEND ON THE TEACHER 
ONE OF OUR BOYS WAS TAKING HIS S. A. T.'S 
THE TEACHER SAID THIS IS THE MOST 
IMPORTANT EXAM WHICH YOU WILL TAKE 
IN YOUR LIFE WHICH YOU DON'T WANT 
TO HEAR 
IT IS A BIT HEAVY 
NICE TO SEE YOU DON'T GET TOO 
WORRIED WORRIED SHE WILL CRUISE 
LET US KNOW ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES 
IF YOU HAVE GOT S. A. T.'S COMING UP 
TODAY AND WHAT YOUR CHILDREN ARE 
FEELING ABOUT IT 
YOU CAN SEE PANORAMA TONIGHT ON B. B. C. 
ONE AT EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY 
NOW THE TIME IS SIX HUNDRED FORTY THREE 
AID AGENCIES ARE CALLING FOR BETTER 
CO OPERATION FROM BURMA'S RULERS TO 
DEAL WITH THE DEVASTATION CAUSED BY 
THE CYCLONE SAVE THE CHILDREN SAYS 
MILLIONS ARE IN DANGER AND THE 
SITUATION IS SET TO GET WORSE 
OUR CORRESPONDENT IS IN THAILAND 
AND THE FIRST AMERICAN AID FLIGHTS 
HAVE JUST LEFT FOR BURMA THAT IS 
RIGHT DANIEL 
THAT'S CORRECT WE 
HAVE SEEN THE AMERICAN C. THIRTY TAXI UP 
TO THE RUNWAY AND JUST LIFT OFF 
INTO THE SKY BEHIND ME ABOUT FIVE 
MINUTES AGO IT IS CARRYING 
SUPPLIES OF MOSQUITO NETS AND WATER 
AND BLANKETS AND IT IS THE FIRST 
FIRST SHIPMENT OF U. S. AID AND IT 
WILL GO TO RANGOON THERE THOUGH 
IT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED BY THE 
BURMESE MILITARY AUTHORITIES 
SOMETHING OF COURSE THAT MANY 
INTERNATIONAL AID AGENCIES AREN'T 
HAPPY ABOUT BUT THE U. S. SAYS THIS 
IS THE FIRST STEP THEY ARE HOPING 
TO SUPPLY MORE AID IN THE FUTURE 
AND INDEED THEY HAVE BEEN TELLING 
US THAT THEY ARE HOPING THAT TWO 
MORE PLANES FILLED WITH WILL GO 
TOMORROW TO RANGOON 
YES STILL ONE PLANE TODAY TWO 
PLANES TOMORROW IT IS NOT ENOUGH 
IS IT 
ABSOLUTELY THE U. S. SPOKES PEOPLE 
HAVE ALSO BACK THEY ARE AWARE OF 
THE FACT THIS IS NO WHERE NEAR 
ENOUGH WE HEARD FROM THE AMERICAN 
AMBASSADOR TO THAILAND REPEATING 
THE MESSAGE WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY LET US IN 
AND HELP SAVE LIVES THE REALITY IS 
BURMA'S MILITARY AUTHORITIES ARE 
ONLY ALLOWING A TRICKLE OF AID 
WHEN IT COMES TO THE FOREIGN AID 
WORKERS THE U. S. AUTHORITIES HERE 
ARE TELLING US TODAY THEY ARE 
WAITING FOR VISAS FOR SOME OF THE 
MOST EXPERIENCED STAFF TO GET INTO 
BURMA TO HELP WITH THIS 
INTERNATIONAL RELIEF OPERATION IT 
GIVES YOU THE IDEA OF THE 
CHALLENGES FACING THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY AS THEY TRY TO HELP THOSE 
WHO NEED IT MOST IN THE AFTERMATH 
OF THE CYCLONE 
THESE ARE THE MAIN STORIES THIS 
MORNING THOUSANDS OF ENGLISH 
PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN BEGIN THEIR 
S. A. T.'S TODAY AMID MOUNTING CRITICISM 
CAUSED WITH THE STRESS 
THE FIRST AMERICAN AID FLIGHT HAS 
LEFT FROM THAILAND TO BURMA BUT 
THERE ARE WARNINGS TWO COUNTRIES ON 
THE BRINK OF UNIMAGINABLE TRAGEDY 
IT IS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS YOU 
WILL LIVE OR DIE DEPENDING ON HOW 
MUCH YOU HAVE RESEARCHED HOW MUCH 
INFORMATION YOU HAVE HOW WOULD YOU 
PUT THAT ACROSS 
WE HEAR THE REMARKABLE STORY OF THE 
CANCER CAMPAIGN A WHO FOUGHT TO 
HELP HER MOTHER SHE IS HELPING 
DOZENS OF OTHER PEOPLE TO GET THE 
DRUGS THEY DESPERATELY NEED 
AS FOR THE WEATHER I SUPPOSE IT IS 
A CASE OF ENJOYING IT WHILE YOU CAN 
BECAUSE IT ISN'T 
GOING TO LAST 
YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT IT IS GOING TO 
CHANGE BY THE END OF THE WEEK 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE BACK DOWN 
THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE HIGH TWENTIES FOR 
MOST OF US IN EXETER YESTERDAY IT 
WAS TWENTY EIGHT DEGREES CELSIUS TODAY FOR 
MOST OF US AGAIN IT IS GOING TO BE 
SUNNY AND WARM IF YOU ARE STARTING 
OFF DULL IT WILL IMPROVE THROUGH 
THE DAY WITH ONE OR TWO EXCEPTIONS 
THE CLOUD IS PRIMARILY IN WESTERN 
AND WILL THEN AREAS WHICH HAS BEEN 
PRODUCING SHOWERY AND THUNDERY 
OUTBREAKS IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND 
WESTERN SCOTLAND IT IS THE EAST 
COAST OF SCOTLAND ON THE NORTH 
COAST OF ENGLAND PRONE TO THIS LOW 
CLOUD AND MIST AND FOG MOST OF IT 
WILL BURN BACK TO THE COAST THROUGH 
THE DAY FURTHER SOUTH WE ARE 
LOOKING AT BEAUTIFUL SUNNY SKIES 
GENTLE BREEZES AND THE TEMPERATURE 
IS NOT BAD IN THE SOUTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND SIMILAR STORY A LOT OF 
BLUE SKY LOT OF BLUE SKY ACROSS 
WALES AS WELL FOR NORTHERN IRELAND 
IT IS DEAL START TO 
THE DAY WITH THE SHOWERS SOME OF WHICH WILL 
CONTINUE TO BE THUNDERY FOR 
LITTLE WHILE YET THE DULL START 
AS I MENTIONED MOST OF THE MIST 
AND FOG SHOULD CLEAR IT MIGHT 
CLING ON TO THE COAST OF THE NORTH 
EAST OF ENGLAND IF IT DOES THAT 
WILL HOLD BACK THE TEMPERATURES 
AWAY FROM THAT TEMPERATURES AS 
HIGH AS TWENTY SIX DEGREES THE SHOWERS 
SHOULD DIE AWAY TONIGHT A CLEAR 
NIGHT BUT WE HAVE THIS LOW CLOUD 
MIST AND FOG COMING OFF THE NORTH 
SEA TOMORROW MOST OF THAT SHOULD 
BURN BACK BUT THERE WILL BE MORE 
OF A NORTH EASTERLY WIND AND LOT OF SUNSHINE AND OFFER BUT DESPITE 
THE TEMPERATURES IN WILL FEEL 
COOLER THAN TODAY BY THE END OF 
THE WEEK HE WILL FEEL COOLER THAN 
WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING OF LATE 
THE WEEK HE WILL FEEL COOLER THAN WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING OF LATE 
WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING OF LATE HE HOUSE PRICES FALLING NOT 
NECESSARILY ALL DOOM AND GLOOM IS 
IT IT NOT NECESSARILY MAKE BUT SAY THE 
OTHERS WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT 
THE DIFFERENT ATTITUDES TOWARDS 
FALLING HOUSE PRICES DESPITE ALL 
THE DOOM AND GLOOM OUT THERE IT 
DOES APPEAR THERE ARE MANY OF US 
WHO SEEMED HAPPY FOR PRICES TO FALL 
OR STILL STAY PUT A THIRD OF 
PEOPLE QUESTIONED FOR A NEW SERIES 
FOR THE B. B. C. SAID THEY WANTED TO 
SEE PRICES FALL AND HALF SAID THEY 
WANTED TO SEE THEM STAY PUT THE 
PRESENTERS WENT TO CAMBRIDGE TO 
FIND OUT MORE 
I WOULD PREFER THEM TO PLATEAU THAN 
TO FALL 
EXCELLENT EXCELLENT 
COMEDOWN OF COURSE L. WOULD LIKE TO 
GET ON THE PROPERTY LADDER MYSELF 
THEY ARE TOO EXPENSIVE OBVIOUSLY 
WHILE I AM BUYING BUT IF I WANTED 
TO SELL I WOULD WANT THEM TO GO UP 
AGAIN AGAIN JIMMY SCOTT IS WITH US WELCOME TO 
BREAKFAST THIS IS INTERESTING 
WHEN WE REPORT FALLING HOUSE PRICES 
AS A NEGATIVE FALLING HOUSE PRICES 
FOR MANY IS GREAT NEWS 
YES THEY WERE AN OPTIMISTIC BUNCH 
IN CAMBRIDGE EVEN THE ONES WHO 
OWNED THEIR OWN HOMES WERE HAPPY TO 
SEE PRICES COME DOWN MOST OF THEM 
WERE FIRST TIME BUYERS STRUGGLING 
TO GET ON THE PROPERTY LADDER ALSO 
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE FIGURED OUT IF 
YOU WANT TO TRADE UP AND BUY MORE 
EXPENSIVE HOME FALLING HOUSE 
PRICES ARE GOOD THING BECAUSE 
THE VALUE OF THE HOME YOU ARE 
SELLING BUT THE VALUE OF THE 
BIGGER HOUSE YOU WANT TO BUY WILL 
FALL BY EVEN MORE SO YOU WILL HAVE 
TO BORROW LESS TO GET IT 
ALSO IT 
IS INTERESTING TO KNOW TYPICALLY 
WHEN WE SEE THE VALUE FOR OFF OUR 
HOMES WE FEEL POORER AND LESS 
WEALTHY BUT IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE 
THE CASE TODAY 
HOUSE PRICES HAVE 
GONE UP BY SO MUCH SO MANY HAVE 
THIS CUSHION IN OUR HOUSE PRICES A 
LOT OF EQUITY A THIRD OF PEOPLE 
DON'T HAVE A MORTGAGE BUT OF THE 
ONES WHO DO THE AVERAGE LOAN TO 
VALUE THE VALUE OF YOUR MORTGAGE 
RELATIVE TO THE VALUE OF YOUR HOUSE 
IS SOMETHING LIKE FORTY FOUR PER CENT SO PRICES 
WILL HAVE TO COME DOWN QUITE A LOT 
TO PUT YOU INTO NEGATIVE EQUITY 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND ESTIMATES IF 
PRICES CAME DOWN BY TWENTY PER CENT ONLY FIVE PER CENT 
OF MORTGAGE HOLDERS WILL GO INTO 
NEGATIVE EQUITY NOT VERY NICE FOR 
THEM BUT NOT ACTUALLY THAT MANY 
PEOPLE PEOPLE THANKS FOR JOINING US BUCHAN CATCH 
THE TRUTH ABOUT PROPERTY TONIGHT 
ON B. B. C. TWO 
THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES MAKE THE MOST 
OF THE WEEKEND'S WHETHER BY 
TO THE BEACH BUT THOSE WITH YOUNG 
CHILDREN KEEPING TRACK OF THEM IS 
NO EASY JOB 
I WAS ON A STONY BEACH AND THAT 
HELPS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT RUN VERY 
FAST BECAUSE THE STONES HER AT 
THEIR FEET BOURNEMOUTH HAS HAD 
TODDLER TAGGING SCHEME AND ITS 
BEACH AND MORE PLACES ARE BEING 
URGED TO USE THE COLOUR CODING 
SYSTEM TO KEEP TRACK OF THEIR 
CHILDREN NICOLA IT IS A BIT 
BREEZY THERE 
YES WE ARE FEELING IT THIS MORNING 
THIS IS THE LATEST WAY OF TRYING TO 
KEEP PARENTS AND CHILDREN TOGETHER 
LAST YEAR HERE THEY GAVE AWAY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
THOUSANDS OF THESE WRISTBANDS THE 
SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE WORKING WELL L. 
WENT TO EASTBOURNE THIS WEEKEND TO 
SEE HOW WHAT IS WORKING THERE 
THESE TWO ARE THE SAME AGE AND ON 
THE SAME BEACH BUT THERE IS ONE 
SMALL DIFFERENCE EMILY ONE OF 
EASTBOURNE'S FOUR MILLION VISITORS IS 
WEARING THE WRISTBAND WITH HER 
PARENTS'S WRIST AND ON IF SHE GETS 
LOST WHOEVER FINDS HER CAN GET IN 
TOUCH IMMEDIATELY THE COLOUR 
MATCHES COLOURED ZONE ON THE 
BEACH WHERE HER FAMILY IS LOCATED 
IS 
THAT THE CORRECT NUMBER YES YES THAT LOOKS RIGHT 
WHAT HAND DO YOU 
WANT IT ON 
IT RELOCATES THE CHILD WITH THEIR 
PARENTS QUICKLY THE FACT WE CAN 
GET HOLD OF THEM INSTANTLY CAUSES 
LESS DISTRESS FOR THE CHILD ON THE 
PARENTS 
LAST YEAR THE RNLI SAYS PARENTS IT'S LIKE GUARDS REUNITED EIGHT HUNDRED SEVEN LAST 
CHILDREN WITH THEIR PARENTS THE 
AVERAGE TIME CHILDREN ARE MISSING 
FORTY FIVE MINUTES 
IF YOU LOOK AWAY FOR A 
MOMENT THEY ARE GONE YOU CANNOT 
SEE THEM AGAIN SO IT IS SCARY 
THAT PANIC YOU HAVE THEY GO SO 
QUICKLY YOU DON'T GET THE CHANCE TO 
STOCK THEM AT LEAST WITH THAT YOU 
HAVE REASSURANCE 
I HAVE FOUR 
GRANDCHILDREN HERE TODAY SO IT IS 
IMPORTANT 
IN BOURNEMOUTH THEY IMPORTANT HAVE INTRODUCED THE WRISTBANDS THE 
NUMBER OF CHILDREN REPORTED MISSING 
ON THE BEACH USED TO BE SIX HUNDRED YEARS 
NOW IT IS AROUND ONE HUNDRED COUNCILS HAVE 
SIMILAR SCHEMES BUT AFTER POSITIVE 
FEEDBACK FROM PARENTS IT IS HOPED 
MORE WILL INTRODUCE THESE TAX 
WE CAN TALK TO MARK SMITH FROM 
BOURNEMOUTH COUNCIL THE HEAD OF 
TOURISM WHY DID YOU INTRODUCE THE 
SCHEME AND HOW HAS IT BEEN WORKING 
WE GET OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION CHILDREN A 
YEAR USING HIS SPEECH SO SAFETY IS 
A BIG RESPONSIBILITY WE WANTED TO 
MAKE SURE THEY ARE LOOKED AFTER 
WELL AND THAT STARTS WITH AN ARMY 
OF PEOPLE LOOKING AFTER THEM THAT 
STARTED WITH THE KID SEWN WHICH 
REUNITES CHILDREN QUICKLY WITH 
THEIR PARENTS IF THEY GET LOST HOW HOW HAVE PARENTS RESPONDED 
WE WERE 
GIVEN AN AWARD THIS YEAR BY MOTHER 
AND BABY MAGAZINE FOR ONE OF THE 
BEST BEACHES 
WE ARE TALKING TO A 
LIFEGUARD HOW HAS THIS MAJOR JOB 
EASIER 
THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE EASIER ARMBANDS IS GREAT IT HELPS US TO 
RELOCATE CHILDREN A LOT QUICKER 
OBVIOUSLY THE DIFFERENT COLOUR 
WRISTBANDS DEPENDS ON WHICH PART OF 
THE BEACH YOU ON SO WE CAN 
PINPOINT WHERE THE CHILD HAS BEEN 
LOST FROM 
PARENTS TRY TO GO OFF TO 
LOOK FOR THEIR CHILDREN EVEN IF 
YOU FIND THEM AND TAKE THEM BACK 
THEY MIGHT NOT BE HERE IS THAT THE 
POINT OF HAVING A MOBILE NUMBER 
YES WE RECOMMEND THAT THE CHILD 
HAS BECOME SEPARATED FROM THE CHILD 
A PARENT HAS BECOME SEPARATED 
FROM THE CHILD LOCATE ONE OF US 
AND WE WILL TAKE BRIEF 
DESCRIPTION AND SET A SEARCH OF 
LONG THE BEACH IT HELPS US TO 
PROVIDE A WIDER SEARCH AREA THANKS THANKS FOR TALKING TO US IT IS HOPED MORE 
COUNCILS WILL INTRODUCE THIS SCHEME 
BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL 
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA 
WE HAVE A SPECIAL GUEST IN THE 
STUDIO IT IS CALLED THE BEAST IT 
HAS SIX NEXT FORTY STRINGS AND IS 
ONLY ONE OF TEN IN EXISTENCE BUT 
APPARENTLY IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO 
PLAY PLAY AND WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU WOULD 
HAVE TO BE VERY SKINNY BECAUSE 
THERE WOULD BE LOTS OF PEOPLE 
WE WILL MEET A MAN WHO SAYS HE CAN 
PLAY THIS

ABILITY TO CREATE HYBRID EMBRYOS 
FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH THESE WERE 
PRODUCED LAST MONTH BY RESEARCHERS 
IN NEWCASTLE THEY ARE NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE PER CENT HUMAN 
BUT CONTAINED A TINY AMOUNT OF 
ANIMAL D. N. A. BECAUSE EMPTY COW EGGS 
WERE USE TODAY CLONE THEM 
SCIENTISTS SAY THEY NEED TO CREATE 
HYBRIDS BECAUSE THERE IS A SHORTAGE 
OF HUMAN EGGS SOME M. P.'S WANT TO 
PROPOSE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL TO 
REDUCE THE UPPER LIMIT FOR ABORTION 
MINISTERS SAY THAT OPPOSITION TO 
THEIR BILL WOULD HOLD BACK MEDICAL 
VERCH CRITICS SAY IT IS IMMORAL 
THIS BILL WILL MAKE THIS COUNTRY 
OUT OF STEP WITH OTHER COUNTRIES 
WE ARE IN DANGER OF BECOMING AN 
UNETH KALLY ROGUE STATE REGULAR 
SLATING FOR AREAS WHICH ARE 
PROHIBITED BY MANY OTHER COUNTRIES 
THE BILL HAS THE BALANCE RIGHT 
BETWEEN THE NEED TO ENSURE RESPECT 
FOR THE THE EMBRYO SO IT IS NOT 
TREATED AS ANY OLD GROUP OF CELLS 
BUT THE NEED TO ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE 
INTO SERIOUS DISEASES 
M. P.'S HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER THE BILL 
LEGITIMISES PRACTISES THAT HAVE 
GONE TOO FAR OR PAVES A WAY FOR 
BETTER MEDICAL RESEARCH AND FOR 
TILLITY TREATMENTS 
AND FOR FERTILITY TREATMENTS 
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TARGETED BY 
COMPANIES OFFERING EASY LOANS 
THROUGH FACEBOOK THAT'S ACCORDING 
TO THE DEBT CHARITY CREDIT ACTION 
IT COMPLAINED TO THE OFFICE OF FAIR 
TRADING ABOUT THE ADVERTS THEY SAY 
THE ADS BREAK THE LAW BECAUSE THEY 
DON'T GIVE DETAILS OF THE INTEREST 
RATES RATES NOW NEARLY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE 
STRIPPED OFF AT AN AUSTRIAN 
FOOTBALL STADIUM ALL IN THE NAME OF 
ART ART IT IS THE LATEST MASS PORTRAIT BY 
THE CONTROVERSIAL AMERICAN 
PHOTOGRAPHER SPENCER TUNICK 
HE GAVE HIS SUBJECTS TAKING OFF 
STRICT INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE THE 
PHOTO SHOOT NO SMILING NO 
SUNGLASSES AND DEFINITELY NO 
UNDERWEAR UNDERWEAR I'M GLAD IT WAS WARM 
IS THAT YOU THIRD FROM THE LEFT NO NO I WILL BE LOOKING CLOSER LATER 
COMING UP LATER 
LORD ROBERT WINSTON WILL BE HERE TO 
TALK ABOUT HIS LATEST SERIES IT IS 
CALLED CHILD OF OUR TIME THIS WEEK 
HE IS TALKING ABOUT STRESS AND 
EXAMS WE WILL BE ASKING HIM ABOUT 
S. A. T.'S 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU BACK TO 
THE STORY OF JIMMY MIZEN 
WE WERE TALKING TO KEITH BREENE 
ABOUT THAT MURDER HE HAD JUST 
TURNED SIXTEEN AND WAS STABBED IN THE 
BAKERY IN SOUTH EAST LONDON 
HE IS THE THIRTEENTH TEENAGER TO HAVE 
BEEN FATALLY ATTACKED IN LONDON 
SINCE THE START OF THE YEAR 
MARGARET AND BARRY MIZEN HAVE BEEN 
TALK BEING THEIR SON 
JIMMY WAS THE SWEETEST BOY YOU 
COULD EVER MEET 
JUST A FINE YOUNG MAN HAPPY ALL 
THE TIME WHISTLED AS HE WALKED 
DOWN THE ROAD 
JIMMY WAS ABLE TO EXPRESS THAT LOVE 
AS WELL YOU COULD GIVE JIMMY HUG 
NO PROBLEM JIMMY WOULD GIVE ME A 
KISS WHEN I DROP HIM OFF AT SCHOOL 
JIMMY WAS FULL OF CONFIDENCE AND 
DECENCY RAN THROUGH JIMMY'S BODY A 
DESCENT FINE YOUNG FELLOW 
PROTECTIVE OF OTHER OTHER PEOPLE 
AND PROTECTIVE OF MAYBE THE WEAK 
HIS FAMILY ADORED HIM THERE WAS NO 
AIRS AND GRACES IT WAS JUST JIMMY 
JUST SIMPLE ENJOYED LIFE LOVED 
HIS FRIENDS LOVED HIS FAMILY AND 
KINDNESS KINDNESS FRIENDS DESCRIBED HIM AS A GENTLE 
DIANT IS THAT GIANT IS THAT HOW 
YOU DESCRIBED HIM 
GENTLE ALWAYS 
HE HAS ALWAYS GROWN BECAUSE ALL 
THE BOYS ARE ALL DIFFERENT SIZES 
THE CAM RADRY BETWEEN THE THREE OF 
THEM THEM FANTASTIC 
I I FEEL SORRY FOR THE PARENTS OF 
THIS BOY WHAT HAPPENED TO JIMMY IS 
AWFUL BUT WE HAVE WONDER AREFUL 
MEMORIES THEY HAVEN'T GOT MONDAY D. 
MONDAY WONDERFUL MEMORIES FOR THEIR 
SON ALL THEY CAN THINK ABOUT IS 
THE EVIL HE HAS DONE 
HIS CHARACTER HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY 
POLICE POLICE AS IMMACULATE AND HIS 
DEATH SHOCKED THE LOCAL COMMUNITY 
WHAT CAN BE DONE TO TACKLE THE 
SUBJECT OF TEENAGE VIOLENCE 
CAMILA BATMANGHELIBJH JOINS US NOW 
OUT OF NOWHERE A BOY GOES TO A 
BAKERY ON SATURDAY MORNING AND 
ENDS UP DEAD AND YOU JUST WONDER 
HOW ON EARTH COULD IT HAPPEN THE 
POLICE SAY IT IS NOT GANG RELATED 
NO AND I THINK SADLY THIS KIND OF 
THING IS GOING TO HAPPEN MORE OFTEN 
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT ROBUSTLY 
ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THE 
CHILDREN WHO ARE BECOMING VERY 
DISTURBED AND THEY WALK AT STREET 
LEVEL LIKE THIS AND THEY CAN 
SOMETIMES RANDOMLY PICK VICTIMS 
CHILDREN WHO ARE SO WELL CARED FOR 
AND HAVE AMAZING PARENTS BECOME 
VICTIMS OF CHILDREN WHO HAVEN'T 
BEEN LOOKED AFTER PROPERLY 
WHEN YOU SAY HAVEN'T BEEN LOOKED 
AFTER PROPERLY YOU ARE TALKING 
ABOUT CHILDREN WITH MENTAL HEALTH 
PROBLEMS THIS ISN'T ABOUT GANGS 
THIS ISN'T ABOUT KNIFE CULTURE 
THIS WAS A RANDOM ATTACK ON A GOOD 
BOY GOING SHOPPING FIRST THING ON 
SATURDAY MORNING WHAT COULD YOU DO 
TO STOP THAT SORT OF THING 
HAPPENING HOW CAN YOU SINGLE THEM 
OUT 
WE KNOW WHO THE CHILDREN ARE OUT FROM A VERY EARLY AGE BECAUSE WE 
SEE THE DISTURBANCE OFTEN IN THEIR 
CARE STRUCTURES 
HOW DO THEY 
BECOME DISTURBED THEY THEY BECOME DISTURBED NO CHILD IS BORN 
VIOLENT OR CRIMINAL IT IS WHAT 
ADULTS DO TO THESE CHILDREN THAT 
MAKES THEM VIOLENT L. DON'T KNOW 
ANYTHING ABOUT THE CHILD OR THE 
INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS COMMITTED THIS 
MURDER BUT IF YOU LOOK AT 
HISTORICALLY ALL THE CASES WHERE 
THERE HAS BEEN A VIOLENCE OFFENCE 
LIKE THIS THE CHILDREN WHO HAVE 
COMMITTED IT HAVE ALL COME FROM 
INCREDIBLY VULNERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES 
PARENTAL DRUG ADDICTION VIOLENCE 
FROM PARENTS TOWARDS CHILDREN AND 
THIS IS THE CULTURE THAT WE'VE 
ENDED UP CREATING WHERE WE ABANDON 
VULNERABLE CHILDREN TO SURVIVE AND 
THEY BECOME SO ANGRY AND SO 
SAVISHED THAT SAVAGED THAT THEY 
DELIVER REVENGE 
IF THE WHOLE SOCIAL SET UP IS 
ROTTEN IN SOME SENSES WHERE DO YOU 
START START DO YOU KNOW WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND 
CHILDREN REFERRED TO CHILD 
PROTECTIVE SERVICES EVERY YEAR WE 
ONLY TAKE THREE OH SEVEN ZERO ZERO AND PUT THEM ON THE 
THE CHILD PROTECTION REGISTER THE 
FAILURE IS WITH USMENT OUR CHILD 
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES CAN'T TAKE 
THE CASES THE FAILURE IS WITH US 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN A YEAR ARE 
DIAGNOSED AS BEING IN SOME PROBLEM 
THEY ARE REFERRED AND THESE ARE THE 
ONES THAT ARE RECOGNISED AND 
REFERRED CAN YOU IMAGINE THE REAL 
SCALE OF IT WE ARE NOT CAPTURING 
THE REAL SCALE OF CHILD ABUSE AND 
NEGLECT IN THIS COUNTRY BUT THE 
PROBLEM IS THAT THE CHILD WHO IS 
BEING ABUSED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS 
DOESN'T IMPACT THE VOTERS LIFE IT 
IS ONLY WHEN THE CHILDREN BECOME SO 
DISTURBED THAT THEY COMMIT 
ATROCITIES LIKE THIS THAT WE BEGIN 
TO NOTICE THEM AND WE GET MOBILISED 
IF WE WANT TO STOP THE PROBLEM AT 
THE SOURCE WE NEED TO GET HOLD OF 
OF CHILD PROTECTION AND CHILD 
MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDRESS IT 
ROBUSTLY WE ARE SO FAILING IN 
THESE TWO AREAS IT IS UNBELIEVABLE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
COMING UP ON THE PROGRAMME LATER ON 
WHAT DO I THINK ABOUT HER IF 
ANYONE WAS IN THIS POSITION THEY 
WOULD KNOW WHAT I THINK ABOUT HER 
WE ARE MEETING A REMARKABLE WOMAN 
THAT MAN IS TALKING ABOUT AND FIND 
OUT WHY HE BELIEVES SHE HAS SAVED 
HIS LIFE 
HE LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME HOW 
THESE WRISTBANDS ARE HELPING TO 
STOP CHILDREN GET PARTED FROM THEIR 
PARENTS ON THE BEACH 
IT COULD BE ANOTHER GOOD DAY ON THE 
BEACH TODAY BUT NOT BY THE END OF 
THE WEEK IS THAT RIGHT 
INDEED BY THE END OF THE WEEK 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE BACKED DOWN IN 
THE TEENS WE HAVE BEEN USED TO 
THEM IN THE MID TWENTIES ACROSS MANY 
PARTS OF THE BRITISH ISLES TODAY 
SUNNY AND WARM FOR MANY OF US AT 
THE MOMENT BIT OF CLOWNED AROUND 
BUT THAT SHOULD THIN AND BREAK AND 
THE SUN SHOULD COME OUT LATER ON 
WITH ONE OR TWO EXCEPTIONS ON THE 
SATELLITE PICTURE YOU CAN SEE WHERE 
WE HAVE THE CLOUD THIS GOES BACK 
FIVE HOURS TO MAURA LESS THE 
CURRENT PICTURE THE CLOUD HAS BEEN 
THINKING OF TO PRODUCE SOME SHOWERS 
BY NINE AM THERE WILL BE BREAKS IN THE 
CLOUD AND SOME SUNSHINE BUT ON THE 
EAST COAST AND NORTH COAST OF 
ENGLAND THERE WILL BE PRONE TO 
MIST AND FOG THIS MORNING MOVE 
AWAY FROM THAT AND THEN TO OTHER 
PARTS OF ENGLAND WE ARE LOOKING AT 
GORGEOUS BLUE SKIES NOT 
PARTICULARLY COLD EITHER INTO THE 
SOUTH WEST WE HAVE BEAUTIFUL 
SUNSHINE AS WELL THIRTEEN DEGREES 
CELSIUS BY NINE A M. IN PLYMOUTH WITH 
LIGHT WINDS AND LIGHT WINDS AND 
SUNSHINE ACROSS WALES HIGH CLOUD 
IN THE NORTH AND WEST IN THE 
NORTHERN IRELAND WE HAVE A CLOUDY 
START WITH THUNDERY SHOWERS BUT IT 
IS IMPROVING IF YOU ARE STUCK 
UNDER THE CLOUD IN THE EAST OF 
ENGLAND THEN THAT WILL PAY BACK 
THE TEMPERATURES BUT GENERALLY IN 
THE EAST A LOT OF THE CLUB WILL 
BURN BACK TO THE COAST MAXIMUM 
TEMPERATURES TWENTY FOUR TO TWENTY SIX DEGREES CELSIUS 
OVERNIGHT CLEARANCE IN THIS 
GUIDE MOST OF THE SHOWERS DYING 
AWAY BUT AGAIN WE WILL SEE MORE 
MIST AND FOG OF THE NORTH SEA OVER 
THE DIRECTION OF THE PENNINES 
TOMORROW AGAIN THAT SHOULD BURN 
BACK TO THE COAST AND WE ARE 
LOOKING FOR ANOTHER FINE AND SUNNY 
DAY IT WILL BE MORE OF A NORTH 
EAST THE LEAD TOMORROW SO WE WILL 
FEEL COOLER HIGHEST TEMPERATURES 
ARE LIKELY TO BE IN THE SOUTH AND 
THE SOUTH WEST LOOKING AT TWENTY THREE 
WHAT WILL WE BUY FROM AARON WHAT 
HAVE YOU GOT FOR SALE 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HIGHER GAS 
PRICES CENTRICA THE PARENT 
COMPANY OF BRITISH GAS THE SAME 
COMPANY THAT WAS CRITICISED FOR 
ANNOUNCING RECORD PROFITS OF WHAT 
TO ZERO POINT ONE BILLION AFTER RAISING ITS 
PRICES ON GAS AND ELECTRICITY 
TWO POINT ONE BILLION ENERGY ACCOUNTS HAVE 
SLOWED FOLLOWING THE PRICE RISE 
AND THAT MEANT BRITISH GAS ENDED 
APRIL WITH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION CUSTOMERS 
BUSINESS SUPPLYING BUSINESS HAS 
PICKED UP AS EXPECTED OVERALL 
PROFITS WELL BELOW WERE AND THE 
FIRST HALF OF LAST YEAR BUT 
LOOKING FURTHER FORWARD BASED A 
WHOLESALE GAS PRICES IN THE U. K. 
REMAIN STUBBORNLY HIGH WE KNOW 
THAT OF COURSE THESE COMPANIES ARE 
VERY QUICK TO TELL US WE HAVE 
WHOLESALE GAS PRICES THE PRICE 
THEY PAY HAS RISEN EIGHTY PER CENT COMPARED TO 
THE WINTER AVERAGE OF LAST YEAR 
THEY SAY THAT AS THE REASON THEY 
HAVE TO PASS ON THESE HIGHER PRICES 
COMPANIES ARE PAYING MORE TO 
EXTRACT THE GAS AND IF THEY HAVE 
TO BUY IT THEY ARE PAYING MORE TO 
BUY IT AND THEY HAVE TO PASS THAT 
ON TO US WE WILL BE TALKING TO AN 
EXPERT LATER HE WILL TELL US WHAT 
WE CAN EXPECT LATER 
WE DO HAVE AN UPLIFTING STORY NOW 
I HOPE YOU WILL FIND IT UPLIFTING 
THIS WOMAN IS NOT A DOCTOR SHE HAS 
HAD NO MEDICAL TRAINING BUT IS A 
REMARKABLE WOMAN SHE GOT IN 
CONTACT WITH US TO TELL US ABOUT 
HER STORY HER NAME IS KATE SPALL 
AND SHE IS HELPING CANCER PATIENTS 
GET LIKE EXTENDING DRUGS 
A STORY BEGAN WHEN HER MOTHER COULD 
NOT GET A DRUG WHICH HADN'T BEEN 
APPROVED ON THE N. H. S. KATE THOUGHT 
THERE HER AND NOW SHE FIGHTS FOR 
OTHERS AND GRAHAM SATCHEL WENT TO 
MEET HER IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY 
STORY STORY SHE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE WITH HER 
OWN MOTHER WHO WAS DIAGNOSED WITH 
KIDNEY CANCER HER DOCTOR SAID 
THERE IS A DRUG AVAILABLE WHICH 
COULD EXTEND HER LIFE BUT YOU 
CANNOT HAVE IT BECAUSE IT IS 
LICENCE BUT NOT APPROVED ON THE N. H. S. 
SHE DID NOT STAND FOR THAT KATE 
CAJOLED AND PERSUADED UNDERSTOOD 
THE SYSTEM OF HOW TO GET IT GOT 
THE DRUG AND NOW SHE IS USING HER 
KNOWLEDGE OF THE SYSTEM TO HELP OF 
A CANCER PENSIONS PATIENCE 
KATE SPALL HAS BECOME AN UNLIKELY 
HERO LIGHT SABRE TO CANCER 
PATIENTS AROUND THE COUNTRY IT 
STARTED WHEN HER OWN MOTHER WAS 
DIAGNOSED WITH KIDNEY CANCER SHE SHE WAS FIFTY SIX YEARS OLD CUTICLE VIBRANT 
AND EVERYONE TO US TO SIT IN A 
ROOM AND FOR PEOPLE TO SAY SORRY 
NOTHING WE CAN DO WAS SOMETHING I 
WOULDN'T ACCEPT AT ALL 
THIS IS 
KATE'S MOTHER PAMELA FILMED LAST 
YEAR THE FAMILY WAS TOLD THERE WAS 
A DRUG THAT COULD EXTEND PAMELA'S 
LIKE AVAILABLE IN EUROPE BUT SHE 
COULD NOT HAVE IT ON THE N. H. S. KATE 
STARTED TO FIGHT SHE LOBBIED 
HARASSED AND WON THE DRUG FOR HER 
MOTHER BUT IT WAS TOO LATE SHE 
DIED SOON AFTER 
IF MUM HAD GOT 
THEM WHEN SHE NEEDED THEM SIX 
MONTHS PRIOR TO WAS GOING THROUGH 
ALL THIS WHO KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAVE 
HAPPENED HAPPENED O. K. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN READING 
THIS TREATMENT 
SPURRED ON CASE 
HAS STARTED HELPING OTHER CANCER 
PATIENTS PATIENCE LIKE BRUCE HE 
WAS TOLD THE CANCER DRUG HE NEEDED 
HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED FOR USE ON 
THE N. H. S. IF HE WANTED IT HE WOULD 
HAVE TO APPEAL 
I WAS SO SHOCKED 
AND HUMILIATED BECAUSE I HAD TO GO 
AND PLEAD FOR MY LIFE THEY MADE ME 
FEEL I WAS IN FERIA NOT EVEN 
WORTHY OF THIS DRUG BRUCE BRUCE DISCOVERED KATE ON THE INTERNET AND 
SHE WORKED ON HIS CASE THE APPEAL 
IS DAUNTING IT IS ALMOST 
IMPOSSIBLE IF YOU ARE FIGHTING 
CANCER AFTER MONTHS OF HARD WORK 
KATE WON THE CASE 
WHAT DO I THINK 
OF HER IF ANYONE WAS IN THIS 
POSITION THEY WOULD KNOW WHAT I 
THINK ABOUT HER SHE GAVE US 
ENDLESS HOURS OF HELP ENDERS 
BOOSTING ME UP WHEN I WAS DOWN L. 
CANNOT DESCRIBE WHAT SHE DID FOR US

WITH THEIR APPEAL AND HAS WON FIFTY OF 
THEM THEM IT IS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS THAT 
YOU WILL LIVE OR DIE DEPENDING ON 
HOW MUCH YOU HAVE RESEARCHED HOW 
MUCH INFORMATION YOU HAVE HOW WILL 
YOU PUT IT ACROSS THAT IS WRONG 
THAT IS VERY FRIGHTENING UNTIL UNTIL CANCER DRUGS ARE MADE MORE 
AVAILABLE MORE QUICKLY KATE WILL 
CONTINUE HELPING PATIENTS BEAT THE 
SYSTEM IN HER OWN TIME FOR NO 
MONEY AS A TRIBUTE TO HER MUM 
AN AMAZING WOMAN WHEN WE FIRST

THANK GOODNESS FOR PEOPLE LIKE HER 
SHE IS PERFORMING THE JOB OF THE 
GOVERNMENT SHE IS DOING A 
WONDERFUL THING HOW DOES SHE DO IT 
AND FIGHT AND WIN THESE APPEALS 
THE SHORT ANSWER IS SHE WORKS HARD 
BUT SHE GETS PATIENTS TO CONTACT 
HER AND SHE WILL CONTACT THEIR 
DOCTOR AND FIND OUT THEIR MEDICAL 
HISTORY SHE HAS TO PROVE THEY ARE 
AN EXCEPTIONAL CASE AND SHE HAS 
PROVED FIFTY OUT OF FIFTY TWO TIMES THEY HAVE 
BEEN EXCEPTIONAL THEN SHE GOES 
THROUGH THE HOSPITAL PROCEDURE SHE 
THREATENS THEM WITH A JUDICIAL 
REVIEW BY THE TIME YOU GO IN FOR 
EUROPEAN YOU HAVE THIS DOSSIER OF 
EVIDENCE AND IT IS AN OVERWHELMING 
CASE 
THESE DRUGS ARE LICENSED AND CASE GIVEN TO PEOPLE ELSEWHERE IN THE 
WORLD WHY DO THESE CASES CROP UP 
DOCTORS DANGLE THIS CARROT THEY 
WANT TO GIVE IT TO YOU BUT WE HAVE 
A SYSTEM OF NICE WHO ASSESS NEW 
DRUGS AND DECIDED THEY SHOULD BE 
USED ACROSS THE N. H. S. IT IS SUPPOSED 
TO STOP POSTCODE LOTTERIES NICE 
SAY IT IS COMPLICATED THEY HAVE TO 
DECIDE WHETHER IT WORKS OR COST 
EFFECTIVE BUT THE FRUSTRATING 
THING IS THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT 
TAKES FOR NICE TO DO THIS WE CAN 
TAKE UP TO FOUR YEARS WHILE THEY 
ARE ASSESSING THESE DRUGS PEOPLE 
LIKE BRUCE WHO YOU SAW IN THAT 
REPORT THEY ARE DYING NOW KATE IS 
FIGHTING FOR THEM

REPRESENTATION OF CHILD'S LEVEL 
ACADEMICS SAY THAT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN 
EVERY YEAR ARE GETTING THE 
INACCURATE LEVEL IT IS NOT TELLING 
PARENTS HONEST INFORMATION IF YOU 
THINK THAT LAST NIGHT THOUSANDS OF 
CHILDREN WILL HAVE SLEEPLESS NIGHT 
AND BE WORRIED SICK AND THE HIGH 
STAKE OF THE TESTS SKEW THE 
EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF THEM 
THEY DON'T HAVE THEM IN SCOTLAND 
AND WALES WHY HAVE THEM IN 
ENGLAND 
BECAUSE OUR GOVERNMENT ENGLAND DECIDE THAT HAD WOULD BE A BEST WAY 
TO REFORM OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND 
BRING UP STANDARDS AND ALSO MAKE 
SCHOOLS ACCOUNTABLE TO PARENTS AND 
TO ALL OF US 
IF CHILDREN ARE GETTING EDUCATED 
PROPERLY IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES WHY 
DO WE WE NEED THEM 
WE DON'T KNOW 
HOW THEY ARE BEING EDUCATED WE ARE 
CONCERNED BY THE FACT THAT YES 
INDEED THEY ARE INACCURATE RESULTS 
FROM S. A. T.'S AND WE HAVE TO ASK 
OURSELVES QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT ARE 
THEY BEING INACCURATELY ASSESSED 
AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS S. A. T.'S HAVE 
FLAWS HOWEVER THEY DO PROVIDE 
VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR 
PARENTS WHICH PARENTS CAN WEIGH UP 
AND PARENTS WEIGH IT UP AND THE 
IDEA THAT PARENTS JUDGE A SCHOOL BY 
THEIR S. A. T. RESULTS IS NOT THE CASE 
PARENTS TAKE ALL SORTS OF THINGS 
INTO ACCOUNT BUT THE S. A. T.'S PROVIDE 
VALUABLE INFORMATION WHICH PARENTS 
CAN USE 
WE HAVE HAD VIEWER E. MAILING US 
FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS MY DAUGHTER 
HAS BECOME VERY STRESSED ABOUT S. A. T.'S 
SHE IS SUFFERING FROM HEADACHES AND 
LOOKS DREADFUL L. HAVE TOLD HER NOT 
TO WORRY AND ALL SHE CAN DO IS HER 
BEST ELEVEN YEAR OLD CHILDREN 
SHOULD NOT BE LOSING SLEEP 
NO IN 
WALES WHERE THEY HAVE THE EXAMS 
THERE IS NOT THIS STRESS WE HAVE 
TO ASK OURSELVES WHERE IS THE 
STRESS 
COMING FROM L. THINK IT IS COMING FROM THE TEACHERS WHO ARE 
TRANSMITTING TRESS TRESS TO THE 
CHILDREN THE CHILDREN WILL NOT 
FEEL THE STRESS IF THEY ARE ASKED 
TO DO TESTS THEY ENJOY TESTS 
EMILY HAS THE TEACHER BEEN SAYING 
THIS IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT 
THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT IT WE ARE 
GETTING STRESSED BECAUSE WE THINK 
IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT IF WE MESS 
UP IT WILL GO WRONG 
YOUR FRIENDS AND CLASSMATES ARE 
THEY GETTING ANXIOUS YOU SEEM 
CONFIDENT ABOUT THEM WHAT ARE YOUR 
FRIENDS WORRIED LOT ABOUT IT 
THEY ARE WORRIED IF YOU DON'T GET 
YOUR EXPECTED LEVEL THAT PEOPLE 
MIGHT LAUGH AT YOU OR SOMETHING 
SARA TOP TIPS FOR DEALING WITH 
CHILDREN WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT 
DOING S. A. T.'S OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
DAYS DAYS HOW DO YOU MANAGE THAT WHAT DO YOU 
SAY TO EMILY 
YOUR COMMENT THAT 
TEACHERS ARE TO BLAVMT TEACHERS ARE 
NOT TO BLAME 
WE TRY NOT TO PUT THE PRESSURE ON 
THE CHILDREN BUT WHEN THE 
GOVERNMENT ARE SAYING YOUR SCHOOL 
MUST GET THESE LEVELS THE 
PRESSURE COMES FROM THE TOP AND WE 
PUT THAT ON OUR CHILDREN MY TIPS 
FOR PARENTS IS THESE EXAMS AT THIS 
LEVEL ARE NOT IMPORTANT FOR THE 
CHILD THEY ARE A TEST OF THE 
SCHOOL AND THE GOVERNMENT AND AND 
ACTUALLY THEY ARE DETRIMENTAL TAKE 
YOUR CHILD OUT TO A MUSEUM SHOW 
THEM A BREADTH OF INFORMATION THE 
TESTING IN THREE SUBJECTS IS NOT 
WHAT EDUCATION IS ABOUT 
I DISPUTE THEY ARE DETRIMENTAL TO 
EDUCATION BECAUSE THEY HAVE 
ENCOURAGED TO SCHOOLS TO ADDRESS 
STANDARDS AND MANY SCHOOLS USE 
TESTS IN ORDER TO RAISE RAISE 
STANDARDS IN SCHOOLS NEW 
HEADTEACHERS TRY TO GET THEIR 
TEACHERS TO RAISE THE LEVELS 
THROUGH THE SATS AND TO PROVE THAT 
THE THE LEVELS ARE RISING IN THAT 
WAY WAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
GOOD LUCK EMILY 
LET US KNOW HOW YOU DO 
GOOD LUCK IF YOU ARE TAKING THE 
EXAMS EXAMS WE HAVE LOTS OF E. MAILS AND TEXTS 
WE ARE GETTING REPORTS OF A LARGE 
EARTHQUAKE IN CHINA IT HAD 
MAGNITUDE OF SEVENTY EIGHT THE SHOCKWAVES 
HAVE BEEN FELT AS FAR AWAY AS 
TAIWAN AND SHANGHAI AND TAIWAN IS 
ACROSS THE SEA WE WILL BRING YOU 
MORE NEWS ON THAT AS SOON AS WE GET 
IT WE'RE TOLD IT WAS LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED 
KILOMETRES FROM THE CAPITAL 
AS FOR THE EPICENTRE WE DON'T KNOW 
HOW POPULATED THAT WAS BUT SEVENTY EIGHT IS 
BIG BIG THE OFFICE BUILDINGS IN SHANGHAI 
FOR SHAKING WITH THE IMPACT THAT'S 
GOT TO BE SERIOUSMENT THAT'S ALL 
WE HAVE ANYMORE DETAILS ON THAT 
EARTHQUAKE IN CHINA WE WILL BRING 
IT TO YOU 
A MAGNITUDE OF SEVENTY EIGHT AND AND IT 
STRUCK CHIN THAT SEVEN WANT 
PROVINCE 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ENGLISH 
PRIMARY SCHOOLCHILDREN BEGIN THE 
S. A. T.'S TODAY AMID MOUNTING CRITICISM 
CAUSED THE TESTS 
BURMA IS BEING WARNED OF BEING ON 
THE BRINK OF UNIMAGINABLE TRAGEDY 
THE NATIONAL TRUST HAS BECOME A 
MASSIVE PROJECT TO PUT ITS GARDENS 
ON THE MAP JOHN KAY CAN EXPLAIN 
MORE IN EXETER 
TALK ABOUT GETTING 
YOUR GARDEN IN ORDER THE NATIONAL 
TRUST WILL PLOT EVERY PLANT AND 
TREE IN ITS GARDENS IN EIGHTY 
PROPERTIES ACROSS THE U. K. WE WILL 
EXPLAIN HOW THEY WILL DO IT LATER 
A GLORIOUS WEEKEND 
TODAY IS GOING TO BE GLORIOUS AS 
WELL FOR MANY THE FORECAST IS 
SUNNY AND WARM TOWARDS THE END OF 
THE WEEK IT WON'T BE AS WARM 
CURRENTLY WE HAVE TEMPERATURES IN 
THE MID TO HIGH TWENTIES BY THE END OF 
THE WEEK THEY WILL BE BACK TO THE 
MID TEENS ON THE SATELLITE PICTURE 
YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH CLOUD HAS BEEN 
PUSHING NORTHWARDS IT HAS PRODUCED 
SHOWERY AND THUNDERY OUTBREAKS OVER 
NORTHERN IRELAND SIMILARLY IN 
WESTERN SCOTLAND FOR EAST AND 
SCOTLAND CLOSE TO THE COAST THERE 
IS LOW CLOUD AS INDEED THERE IS ON 
THE EAST COAST OF ENGLAND FOR THE 
REST OF ENGLAND WE ARE LOOKING AT 
FINE SUNSHINE TOWARDS THE SOUTH 
COAST A LOT OF SUNSHINE WE HAVE 
HAD IT ALREADY IN BRIGHTON AS WE 
GO OVER TOWARDS THE SOUTH WEST AS 
WE SAW IN EXETER IT IS SUNNY AND 
IT IS SUNNY IN LONDON ALSO SUNNY 
IN WALES AND ALSO THE NORTH OF 
WALES IN NORTHERN IRELAND THERE 
IS MORE CLOUD AND THAT WAS WHAT 
PRODUCED THE SHOWERS IT IS AN 
IMPROVING PICTURE AND IT WILL 
BRIGHTEN UP FOR MANY OF US THE 
SUNSHINE WILL PREVAIL CLOSE TO THE 
NORTH EAST COAST OF ENGLAND YOU 
MIGHT FIND THE LOW CLOUD WILL HANG 
AROUND IF IT DOES THAT WILL HOLD 
BACK THE TEMPERATURES BUT AWAY 
FROM THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT TIES OF 
TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE 
THE TWENTY SIX DEGREES CELSIUS 
TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE MAY THE TWENTY SIX DEGREES CELSIUS MOST OF THE SHOWERS WILL DIE AWAY 
BUT ONCE AGAIN YOU WILL FIND THE 
MIST LOW CLOUD AND FOG WILL ATTACH 
TO THE SHORES THE EAST COAST OF 
ENGLAND WEST OF THE PENNINES 
TOMORROW IT WILL RETREAT BUT THE 
WIND WILL COME FROM THE NORTH EAST 
SO IT WILL FEEL COOLER THE WARMEST 
PART OF THE COUNTRY WILL BE IN THE 
SOUTH AND THE SOUTH WEST WHERE WE 
ARE INTO THE MID TWENTIES TWENTY THREE HIS SEVENTY THREE 
FAHRENHEIT 
WE HAVE AN UPDATE ON CENTRICA AND 
IT IS NOT PARTICULARLY GOOD NEWS 
IT IS NOT LET'S TALK ABOUT 
WHOLESALE GAS PRICES HIGHER 
WHOLESALE GAS PRICES ARE PUTTING 
THE PRESSURE AND THE SQUEEZE ON THE 
ENERGY COMPANY CENTRICA THE 
PARENT COMPANY OF BRITISH GAS THE 
COMPANY SAID WITH ITS LATEST PRICE 
RISE IN JANUARY ITS PROFIT MARGINS 
CONTINUE TO BE SQUEEZED EVEN BELOW 
ITS OWN EXPECTATIONS IS ALL THIS 
HINT WE COULD SEE FURTHER RISES IN 
OUR FUEL BILLS WE CAN SEE IF WE 
CAN FIND THIS OUT BECAUSE CHRIS 
BODEN IS WITH US WE HAVE SEEN 
PRICE RISE AT A PRICE RISE AND 
AGAIN A FURTHER HINT THERE IS MORE 
TO COME 
THE PROBLEM FOR CENTRICA IT HAS TO 
BUY A LOT OF ITS GAS ON THE 
WHOLESALE MARKET IT PRODUCES SOME 
OF ITS GAS BUT IT HAS TO MAKE UP 
THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WHOLESALE 
MARKET THOSE GAS PRICES ARE A LOT 
HIGHER 
IT HITS ALL OF US HARD BUT HIGHER IN PARTICULAR THESE RISES HIT SMALL 
BUSINESSES HARD 
YES WE ESTIMATE 
IF YOU ARE BUYING GAS AS A SMALL 
BUSINESS A HAIRDRESSER OR A SMALL 
BOOKSHOP MAY BE NASTY YOU PAID 
FIVE THOUSAND FOR ELECTRICITY AND GAS 
THIS YEAR YOU WILL BE PAYING ALMOST 
DOUBLE THAT 
ALSO CHIP SHOPS THEY 
USE MORE ENERGY AND THEY ARE HIT 
VERY HARD 
YES WE ESTIMATE THEY 
WILL BE PAYING ALMOST DOUBLED THIS 
YEAR THAN THEY WERE LAST YEAR CAN CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT TO US WHY GAS 
PRICES SEEM TO BE LINKED WITH OIL 
PRICES WHICH AS WE KNOW ON A 
RECORD HIGH AS WELL 
THAT IS 
BECAUSE GAS IN THE U. K. A LOT IS 
COMING FROM EUROPE IN EUROPE 
ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF GAS IS INDEX LINKED 
TO COIL THE HIGHER THE OIL PRICE 
THE HIGHER THE GAS PRICE IN EUROPE 
SO THAT IS IMPACTING US IN THE U. K. 
IS THERE ANY LIGHT AT THE END OF 
THE TUNNEL 
I THINK WE WILL SEE 
INCREASED RETAIL PRICES TWENTY PER CENT HIGHER 
AS FORECAST BY SOME OF THE ANALYSTS 
MORE DOOM AND GLOOM AS I SAID 
DON'T SHOOT THE MESSENGER THAT IS 
IT FROM ME ENOUGH 
BUT YOU SAY IT WITH SMILE ON YOUR FACE FACE IF YOU CANNOT SMILE YOU WOULD BE 
CRYING CRYING LOTS OF PEOPLE MADE THE MOST OF THE 
WEEKEND'S WARM WEATHER BY HEADING 
TO THE BEACH BUT FOR THOSE WITH 
YOUNG CHILDREN KEEPING TRACK OF 
THEM AS THEY GET CARRIED AWAY BY 
THE SEASIDE IS NOT EASY 
BOURNEMOUTH HAS HAD A TODDLER 
TAGGING SCHEME ON ITS BEACHES FOR 
YEARS NOW AND MORE COUNCILS ARE 
BEING ENCOURAGED TO USE THE COLOUR 
CODED SYSTEM NICOLA IS DOWN ON THE 
BEACH FOR US THIS MORNING 
YES IN BOURNEMOUTH HE THEY HAVE 
BEEN PIONEERING THIS COLOURED 
WRISTBAND SCHEME FOR SOME TIME WILL 
STOP NOW OTHER COUNCILS AROUND THE 
U. K. ARE STARTING TO ALSO USE THIS 
INITIATIVE I SPENT THE WEEKEND IN 
EASEBOURNE LOOKING AT HOW IT WORKS 
THESE TWO CHILDREN ARE THE SAME AGE 
AND ON THE SAME BEACH BUT THERE IS 
A SMALL DIFFERENCE EMILY ONE OF 
EASTBOURNE'S FOUR MILLION VISITORS 
EVERY YEAR IS WEARING WRISTBAND 
WITH HER PARENTS CONTACT DETAILS 
IF SHE GETS LOST WHOEVER FINDS 
THERE WILL BE ABLE TO GET IN TOUCH 
WITH HER PARENTS THE COLOUR 
MATCHES A COLLINS ZONE ON THE BEACH 
WHERE EMILY'S FAMILY IS LOCATED 
ZONE THAT THE CORRECT NUMBER ZONE IS THAT THE CORRECT NUMBER YES THAT LOOKS RIGHT 
IT RELOCATES THE CHILD WITH THEIR 
PARENTS QUICKLY THE FACT WE CAN 
GET HOLD OF THEM INSTANTLY CAUSES 
LESS DISTRESS 
LAST YEAR THE RNLI 
SAYS IS LIKE GUARDS REUNITED EIGHT HUNDRED SEVEN 
LOST CHILDREN THE AVERAGE TIME THE 
CHILDREN WERE MISSING 
FORTY FIVE MINUTES 
IF YOU LOOK AWAY FOR A MOMENT THEY 
ARE GONE YOU CANNOT SEE THEM AGAIN 
SO IT IS SCARY 
THAT PANIC YOU HAVE 
THEY GO SO QUICKLY YOU DON'T GET 
THE CHANCE TO STOP THEM 
I HAVE 
FOUR GRANDCHILDREN HERE TODAY SO 
IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE I AM TRYING 
TO WATCH ALL OF THEM 
IN FORM OF 
THEY HAVE INTRODUCED THE WRISTBANDS 
THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN REPORTED 
MISSING ON THE BEACH USED TO BE SIX HUNDRED 
YEAR NOW IT IS AROUND ONE HUNDRED SOME 
COUNCILS HAVE SIMILAR SCHEMES AND 
AT THE POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM 
PARENTS IT IS HOPED MORE WILL 
INTRODUCE THE WRISTBANDS 
I AM JOINED ON THE BEACH THIS 
MORNING BY THIS FAMILY THIS IS 
WRYLY AND BRAWN D. MUMBAI JAYNE AND 
DAD ALI WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT 
THIS DREAM SCHEME 
IT ADDS LOTS 
OF REASSURANCE FOR US ON THE BEACH

FOR SECOND AND THEY ARE GONE 
SOMETIMES IT IS OH MY GOD THEY 
ARE GONE 
WHEN THE BEACH IS SO BUSY 
THEY WILL RUN OFF AND YOU HAVE NO 
IDEA AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA 
EVERYTHING LOOKS THE SAME THEY THEY JUST GO OFF AND LITERALLY IT IS 
JUST SOMEONE TO TURN TO AND HELP 
YOU AND THEM TO RECOGNISE SOMEONE

HAVE YOUR PHONE ON YOU YOU KNOW 
ALIGHT GOD OR SOMEONE ON THE BEACH 
CAN GIVE YOU A CALL 
TO KNOW THERE

CAN GO THERE AND THEY RECOGNISE 
THEM 
IT IS NOT ABOUT BEING A BAD THEM PARENT IT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE 
THEY RUN OFF NOW AND THERE IS 
NOBODY ON THE BEACH 
THEY ARE SO 
QUICK 
IT DEFINITELY IS BRILLIANT QUICK IT IS A BRILLIANT SCHEME I'M 
REALLY RATED 
WOULD IT MAKE YOU 
CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT GOING TO A 
BEACH IF THEY HAD THIS PARTICULAR 
SCHEME IN OPERATION DEFINITELY DEFINITELY JUST TO KNOW THERE IS ANOTHER PAIR 
OF EYES YOU CAN GO TO TO GET SOME 
HELP I WOULD MORE THAN LIKELY GO 
TO A BEACH THAT HAS THE WRISTBAND 
IN OPERATION RATHER THAN NOT

I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT POLICY 
EVOLVING AS WE DEVELOP THE PILOT 
WHILE THERE IS GROWING OPPOSITION

SIBLING WHERE A BABY CELL IS USED 
TO TREAT A GENETIC CONDITION IN AN 
OLDER BROTHER OR SISTER THE 
WHITAKER FAMILY WERE THE FIRST IN 
BRITAIN TO DO JUST THAT AND JAYSON 
AND MICHELLE JOIN US FROM THEIR 
HOME ALONG WITH THEIR BOYS HELLO 
GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING 
TELL US 
FIRST WHY DID YOU NEED TO GO 
FORWARD WITH THIS SO CALLED 
SAVIOUR SIBLING HOW HAS IT 
WORKED IN YOUR FAMILY 
IT'S WORKED 
VERY WELL FOR OUR FAMILY 
WE DECIDED TO GO AHEAD WITH IT AND 
THE END RESULT IS WE HAVE A HEALTHY 
NINE YEAR OLD BOY NOW AND A LOVELY 
FOUR YEAR OLD BOY 
YOU HAD TO GET 
SOME HELP FROM ABROAD IS THAT 
RIGHT 
YES WE WERE TURNED DOWN BY RIGHT THE H. F. E. A. IN THIS COUNTRY SO WITH 
THE HELP OF OUR CONSULTANT WITHOUT 
HIM WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE WOULD 
BE NOW HE TOOK US TO AMERICA WHERE 
WE HAD THE TREATMENT DONE THERE 
LET'S TALK TO JAYSON THIS ISSUE IS 
COMING UP BEFORE PARLIAMENT M. P.'S 
ARE GOING TO DEBATE THIS BILL HOW 
IMPORTANT IS IT FOR YOU JAYSON THAT 
THIS PROCESS SHOULD NOW BECOME 
LEGAL 
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT WE HAD A REAL 
BATTLE ON OUR HANDS THEY TURNED US 
DOWN EVERYTHING HAD TO GO TO 
COMMITTEE THEY MADE ALL THE 
DECISIONS ON A PIECE OF PAPER WE 
WEREN'T ALLOWED TO ATTEND IT WAS 
ALMOST LIKE A COUNCIL PLANNING 
APPLICATION NOW THEY ARE GOING TO 
GIVE PERMISSION FOR IT TO HAPPEN 
WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH ALL 
THE APPLICATIONS IT IS NOT A 
DECISION THAT PEOPLE ENTER LIGHTLY 
IN OUR CASE WE HAD CHILD WE 
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE WAS WE 
KNEW IT WAS VERY UNCERTAIN THANKS 
TO THE STEM CELL FROM JAMIE'S CORD 
BLOOD HE WAS ABLE TO HELP SAVE 
CHARLIE AND GIVE HIM GOOD QUALITY 
OF LIFE 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 
DISEASE THAT CHARLIE HAD SO HE HAD 
A PROBLEM WITH HIS BONE MARROW 
CHARLIE COULDN'T MAKE ANY RED CELLS 
SO HE SURVIVED ON THREE WEEKLY 
TRANSFUSIONS OF BLOOD THE PROBLEM 
IS THAT THE IRON FROM THE BLOOD HE 
WAS GIVEN LODGED IN HIS BODY AND 
STARTED TO DO DAMAGE TO HIS ORGANS 
SO THE DAMAGE TO THE ORGANS THE 
IRON HAD TO BE STRIPPED OUT BY 
ANOTHER CHEMICAL SO EVERY NIGHT HE 
WAS RIGGED UP TO A PUMP THE 
MEDICATION HAS CHANGED SLIGHTLY 
SINCE THEN YOU HAVE CHOICE NOW 
OF AN ORAL MEDICATION OR A PUMP 
CHARLIE HAD TO HAVE PUMP RIGGED 
UP EVERY NIGHT TO HELP CONTROL HIS 
DISORDER 
YOU WILL BE AWARE THAT DISORDER OPPONENTS OF THIS PROCEDURE SAY IT 
COULD LEAD TO SPARE PART SIBLINGS 
AND TO A SELECTION PROCESS FOR MALE 
OR FEMALE BABIES 
WELL THAT IS 
TRUE L. HAVE HEARD THAT WHEN WE 
HAD EMILY'S CORD BLOOD HARVESTED 
THAT CREATED NO INTEREST WHATSOEVER 
IT JUST HAPPENED THAT EMILY AND 
CHARLIE WEREN'T A MATCH SO EMILY 
WAS THE FIRST SAVIOUR SIBLING SO 
TO SPEAK WHEN JAMIE WAS CREATED 
WITH I. V. F. WHICH HAPPENS ALL OVER 
THE WORLD WE DIDN'T PICK HAIR 
COLOUR SEX EYE COLOUR WE PICKED 
YOU HAVE A ONE IN FOUR CHANCE OF 
HAVING A TISSUE MATCH SO WE 
SLIGHTLY CHANGED THE ODDS TO HAVING 
A ONE IN ONE CHANCE JAMIE WAS 
JAMIE HE WAS LOVED FOR JAMIE HE 
WAS JUST HE CAME OUT WE DIDN'T 
KNOW WHAT HE WAS UNTIL HE WAS BORN 
YOU COULD ARGUE IT'S A SLIPPERY 
SLOPE BUT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE 
TECHNOLOGY TO DO THAT 
YOU HAVE 
THREE LOVELY CHILDREN WE DIDN'T 
INTRODUCE EMILY AT THE BEGINNING 
APOLOGIES HELLO TO YOU HOW ARE 
ALL YOUR CHILDREN AT THE MOMENT 
HOW ARE THEY FEELING 
THEY ARE VERY 
WELL THANK YOU CHARLIE STILL GOES 
TO THE HOSPITAL EVERY SIX MONTHS

AS IT WAS YESTERDAY FOR MANY PARTS 
OF THE COUNTRY THAT IS EXACTLY THE 
WEATHER FORECAST IT IS ANOTHER 
SUNNY ONE AND A WARM ONE AS WELL

BRILLIANT FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR 
WE HAVE A LOT OF CLOUD IN SOME PART 
OS THE COUNTRY YOU CAN SEE THAT 
IT HAS BEEN PRODUCING THUNDERRY 
SHOWERS OVER NORTHERN IRELAND AND 
WESTERN SCOTLAND 
BUT GENERALLY BY NINE HUNDRED A M. THIS IS THE 
KIND OF PICTURE WE EXPECT BREAKS 
IN THE CLOUD WITH SUNSHINE OVER 
SCOTLAND THE EAST COAST OF 
SCOTLAND NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND 
PRONE TO LOW CLOUD FOR THE REST OF 
ENGLAND THAT INCLUDES THE NORTH 
WEST YOU CAN SEE THE AMOUNT OF 
SUNSHINE THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY 
ENJOYING IT IS A PLEASANT START TO 
THE DAY IT DOES NOT FEEL COLD 
GENTLE LIGHT BREEZES OVER TO THE 
SOUTH WEST PLYMOUTH WILL BE ABOUT 
THIRTEEN CELSIUS BY NINE HUNDRED WALES ENJOYING 
SUNSHINE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND THIS 
MORNING THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF 
CLOUD AROUND BUT HERE IT IS AN 
IMPROVING PICTURE THROUGH THE DAY 
WE WILL SEE SUNSHINE AS WELL MOST 
OF THE LOW CLOUD MIST AND MURK 
WILL BURN OFF TO THE COAST SOME 
ACROSS THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND 
IN PARTICULAR COULD CLING IF IT 
DOES THAT WILL PEG BACK THE 
TEMPERATURES AWAY FROM THE COASTS 
WE ARE WELL INTO THE TWENTIES STILL A 
GOOD CLEARANCE OVERNIGHT IN THE SKY 
MOST OF THE SHOWERS DYING AWAY 
CLOSE TO THE EAST COAST THE LOW 
MIST AND FOG HEADING AS FAR WEST 
AS THE PENNINES NOT A PARTICULARLY 
COLD NIGHT OR COLD START TO THE DAY 
TOMORROW LIKE TODAY MOST OF THE 
MIST AND FOG BURNING AWAY TOMORROW 
MORE OF A NORTHEASTERLY WIND IT 
WILL FEEL COOLER THAN TODAY 
SHE IS NOT A DOCTOR IN FACT SHE'S 
HAD NO MEDICAL TRAINING BUT A 
REMARKABLE WOMAN KATE SPALL IS 
HELPING PATIENTS GET LIFE EXTENDING 
DRUGS HER BATTLE STARTED WHEN HER 
MOTHER WAS NOT APPROVED DRUGS ON 
THE N. H. S. NOW SHE IS FIGHTING FOR 
OTHERS SHE CONTACTED BREAKFAST TO 
TELL US ABOUT HER DAVID AND GOLIATH 
STORY WE ARE GETTING E. MAILS FROM 
PEOPLE ASKING US TO TELL US MORE 
HER MOTHER WAS DYING OF KIDNEY 
CANCER HER DOCTOR SAID THERE IS A 
DRUG AVAILABLE IT COULD EXTEND YOUR 
MOTHER'S LIFE BY THREE OR FOUR 
YEARS WE CANNOT GIVE IT TO YOU IT 
HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED FOR USE ON 
THE N. H. S. KATE WOULD NOT STAND FOR 
THAT SHE FOUGHT HER LOCAL HEALTH 
AUTHORITY SHE MASTERED THE SYSTEM 
AND EVENTUALLY GOT THIS DRUG FOR 
HER MUM NOW SHE IS SHARING THE 
KNOWLEDGE SHE FOUND THROUGH THAT 
PROCESS WITH OTHER CANCER PATIENTS 
KATE SPALL HAS BECOME SOMETHING OF 
AN UNLIKELY HERO A LIFE SAVER TO 
CANCER PATIENTS AROUND THE COUNTRY 
IT STARTED WHEN HER OWN MOTHER WAS 
DIAGNOSED WITH KIDNEY CANCER SHE SHE WAS FIFTY SIX YEARS OLD BEAUTIFUL 
VIBRANT EVERYTHING TO USMENT AND 
TO SIT IN A ROOM AND FOR A TEAM OF 
PEOPLE TO SAY REALLY SORRY 
NOTHING WE CAN DO WAS NOT 
SOMETHING I WOULD ACCEPT AT ALL 
THIS IS KATE'S MUM FILMED LAST YEAR 
WITH KATE'S SISTER THE FAMILY WERE 
TOLD THERE WAS DRUG WHICH COULD 
EXTEND PAMELA'S LIFE AVAILABLE IN 
THE REST OF EUROPE BUT SHE COULD 
NOT HAVE IT ON THE N. H. S. KATE 
STARTED TO FIGHT SHE LOBBIED 
HARASSED AND WON THE DRUG FOR HER 
MUM BUT TOO LATE KATE'S MUM DIED 
SOON AFTER 
IF MUM GOT IT WHEN SHE 
NEEDED IT SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO 
GOING THROUGH ALL OF THIS WHO 
KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPEN 
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED 
SPURRED ON BY 
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER MUM KATE HAS 
STARTED HELPING OTHER CANCER 
PATIENTS PATIENTS LIKE BRUCE 
LEVERINGTON BRUCE LEVERINGTON WAS 
TOLD THE CANCER DRUG HE NEEDED WAS 
NOT APPROVED FOR USE ON THE N. H. S. IF 
HE WANTED IT HE WOULD HAVE TO 
APPEAL 
I WAS SO SHOCKED AND APPEAL HUMILIATED BECAUSE I HAD TO GO AND 
PLEAD FOR MY LIFE THEY MADE ME 
FEEL THAT I WAS INFERIOR I WAS NOT 
EVEN WORTHY OF THIS DRUG BRUCE 
DISCOVERED KATE ON THE INTERNET 
SHE STARTED TO WORK ON HER CASE 
THE APPEAL IS A DAUNTING PROCESS 
IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IF YOU ARE 
ALSO FIGHTING CANCERMENT AFTER 
MONTHS OF HARD WORK KATE WON THE 
CASE 
WHAT DO I THINK OF HER IF CASE ANYONE WAS IN THIS POSITION THEY 
WOULD KNOW WHAT I THINK OF HER 
SHE GAVE US 
ENDLESS HOURS OF HELP ENDLESS BOOSTING ME UP WHEN I WAS 
DOWN SHE BOOSTED US UP L. CAN'T 
DESCRIBE WHAT SHE DONE FOR US FOR 
NOT ME ME MY TWO SONS 
KATE HAS HAD AN ASTONISHING SUCCESS 
RATE SHE HAS HELPED FIFTY TWO PATIENTS 
WITH THEIR APPEAL AND HAS WON FIFTY OF 
THEM 
IT IS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS THEM THAT YOU WILL LIVE OR DIE DEPENDING 
ON HOW MUCH YOU HAVE RESEARCHED 
HOW MUCH INFORMATION YOU HAVE HOW 
WELL YOU PUT THAT ACROSS THAT IS 
WRONG THAT IS VERY FRIGHTENING 
UNTIL CANCER DRUGS ARE MADE MORE 
AVAILABLE MORE QUICKLY KATE WILL 
CONTINUE HELPING PATIENTS BEAT THE 
SYSTEM IN HER OWN TIME FOR NO 
MONEY AS TRIBUTE TO 
HER MUM IN HER OWN TIME W. NO MONEY WE'VE JUST 
HAD A TEXT KATE HAS OFFERED MY 
DAD AND ALL OF US UNCONDITIONAL 
SUPPORT AND OFFERED HIM HELP AFTER 
HE HAD GIVEN UP GOING THROUGH 
THAT APPEAL IS LENGTHY 
IT IS IT 
IS INCREEDABLY COMPLY KAITD YOU 
IMAGINE THE SITUATION YOU HAVE 
BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH TERMINAL CANCER 
THE LAST THING ON YOUR MIND IS 
BEING ABLE TO FIGHT SOME KIND OF 
INTIMIDATING DAUNTING APPEALS 
PROCESS THAT IS WHAT KATE DOES 
SHE TALKS TO YOUR DOCTOR GOES 
THROUGH THE HOSPITAL PROCESS SHE 
THREATS THEM WITH JUDICIAL REVIEW 
BY THE TIME YOU GO INTO THE APPEAL 
SHE HAS GIVEN YOU THIS OVERWHELMING 
DOSSIER OF ED FOR HER SHE THINKS 
THIS SYSTEM IS NUTS IT IS THE LAST 
THING WHICH SHOULD HAPPEN THEY 
SHOULD TRY AND HELP YOU AS MUCH AS 
POSSIBLE THEN SHE WOULD NOT HAVE 
TO DO THIS 
WE PR IN A SITUATION 
WHERE THESE DRUGS ARE LICENSED AND 
BEING USED IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND 
YET FOR SOME REASON IT IS SUCH A 
STRUGGLE FOR PEOPLE TO GET HOLD OF 
THEM HERE 
WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES NICE WHICH 
ASSESSES ALL NEW DRUGS IT IS MEANT 
TO STOP THE POST CODE LOTTERY SO 
EVERY HOSPITAL DOES THE SAME THING 
IN ENGLAND AND WALES ON THE 
SURFACE IT IS A GOOD IDEA NICE 
HAVE TO LOOK AT EVERY DRUG ASSESS 
WHETHER IT WORKS WHETHER IT IS 
COST EFFECTIVE IT IS A LIMITED POT 
THEY JUST CANNOT SAY YES EVERYONE 
CAN HAVE THEM THEY SAY IN THEIR 
DEFENCE THEY HAVE PROVED NINETY ONE PER CENT OF 
THESE CANCER DRUGS OVER THE YEAR 
THEY IS APPROVED NINETY ONE PER CENT OF DRUGS OVER 
THE YEARS HOSPITALS CAN NOT JUST 
SAY JUST BECAUSE NICE HAVE NOT 
DECIDED YOU CANNOT GET THIS DRUG 
IN EFFECT THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS 
WHAT KATE AND OTHER CAMPAIGNERS ARE 
SAYING IS NICE HAS TO GET ON WITH 
THIS THEY HAVE TO SPEED THIS UP 
WHILE THEY ARE WAITING FOR NICE TO 
MAKE THEIR DECISION PEOPLE LIKE 
BRUCE WHO YOU SAW IN THAT REPORT 
ARE DYING 
LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE GOT 
IN TOUCH SAYING CAN KATE HELP US 
SHE WILL TAKE ON ALL CASES 
THERE IS A LINK ON OUR WEBSITE TO 
HER WEBSITE IF YOU GO TO OUR 
WEBSITE AND ASK FOR MORE 
INFORMATION YOU WILL FIND HER 
IT IS A GREAT DAY TO BE OUTSIDE 
WHICH WILL HELP THE GARDENER OS THE 
NATIONAL TRUST AS THEY BEGIN A 
MAMMOTH TASK THE U. K.'S BIGGEST EVER 
PLANT HUNT THEY WILL TRAVEL AROUND 
THE TRUST'S EIGHTY MOST IMPORTANT 
GARDENS AND CATALOGUE EVERY SINGLE 
PLANT THEY WILL TAKE PICTURES OF 
THEM AND PLOT THEM ON A GLOBAL 
POSITIONING SYSTEM THEY HOPE TO 
FIND SOME SPECIESS WHICH HAVE NEVER 
BEEN FOUND BEFORE JON KAY IS AT 
KILLERTON HOUSE IT WILL BE A LONG 
DAY DAY IT WILL TAKE THEM THREE YEARS L. 
ONLY HAVE A SMALL CITY GARDEN AND 
DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT IS IN IT 
THESE GUYS HAVE SCORES OF 
PROPERTIES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS 
OF PLANTS IN THEM AND THEY ARE 
TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY HAVE 
GOT MALCOLM IS TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS 
OF THIS SPLENDID ROW DEDEN DRUM 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE DOING THIS 
FRPBLGTD WELL WE WILL GO AROUND THE 
WELL WE WILL GO AROUND THE GARDEN AND LOG EVERY SINGLE PLANT WE WILL 
START WITH THE TREES AND SHRUBS AND 
USE A SATELLITE RECORDING SYSTEM TO 
PINPOINT WHERE THEY ARE ON A 
DIGITAL MAP RECORD ALL THE 
INFORMATION WE KNOW ABOUT IT FOR 
EXAMPLE WITH THIS SHRUB RECORD 
WHERE IT IS WHAT IT IS AND MAKE 
SURE IT HAS A TAG NUMBER 
SO YOU 
ARE USING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY 
THESE DATE FROM ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHT 
THEY ARE TWO HUNDRED YEARS 
THAT ERA LOTS 
OF ADVENTURERS CAME BACK TO BRITAIN 
AND BROUGHT BACK EXOTIC PLANTS IN 
SOME CASES THEY DID NOT RECORD THEM 
SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE GOT 
THAT IS RIGHT THE GARDENS HERE WE 
HAD A VERY STRONG LINK WITH FEECH 
NURSERY HIS DESCENDANTS SENT OUT 
PLANT HUNTERS AROUND THE WORLD AND 
USED THIS AS A TRIAL GROUND BECAUSE 
THE GROWING CONDITIONS ARE SO GREAT 
THAT MUST BE EXCITING FOR YOU TO 
THINK YOU MIGHT DISCOVER SPECIESS 
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT 
IT WOULD 
BE FANTASTIC L. UNDERSTAND THAT HAS 
BEEN THE CASE BUT EVEN IF THEY ARE 
NOT TOTALLY UNKNOWN BEFORE THERE 
WILL BE SOME RARE PLANTS THERE'LL 
BE SOME HISTORICALLY INTERESTING 
PLANTS WHICH HAVE PARTICULAR LINKS 
WITH NAMED PLANT HUNTERS IT IS 
REALLY REALLY VITALLY IMPORTANT 
THAT WE CONTINUE THAT LINE AND WE 
KNOW WHAT IT IS WE HAVE GOT SO WE 
CAN PROPAGATE THAT AND KEEP IT 
GOING FOR THE FUTURE 
TALK ABOUT 
PROPAGATION ONE OF THE KEY THINGS 
IS THEY WILL TAKE CUTTINGS FROM THE 
EXOTIC RARE PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN 
SPECIES AND TAKE THEM TO A PLANT 
CENTRE IN DEVON AND PROPAGATE THEM 
AND SAVE THEM FOR FUTURE 
GENERATIONS 
WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU REALISE YOU 
HAVE MISSED ONE

TALKING ABOUT STRESS AND PRESSURE 
AND FOOTBALL WHAT ABOUT ON 
CHILDREN TOO MUCH STRESS AND 
PRESSURE RUINING OUR CHILDREN'S 
LIVES WE HEAR ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT 
IT IS TO BE YOUNG NOW WHAT'S IT 
LIKE TO BE EIGHT YEARS OLD 
IT IS A 
LONG TIME AGO A CHILD OF OUR TIME 
HAS BEEN FINDING OUT WE WILL TALK 
TO THE PRESENTER OF THE SERIES IN A 
MINUTE LET'S LOOK AT WHETHER 
PARENTS ARE MAKE AGO ROD FOR THEIR 
OWN BACKS 
MAKING A ROD FOR THEIR OWN BACKS 
WE OBSERVED ALL OF OUR FAMILIES AT 
HOME AND AT SCHOOL TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
WHATEVER THEY WERE DOING 
HOW IS THIS YOUR YOUR FOREFIT THAT 
YOU AGREED WITH ME IS TO SHOW YOUR 
THING FOR TEN SECONDS 
THAT'S DISGUSTING 
WE ALSO NOTED WHAT THEY WERE DOING 
WHERE THEY WERE AND WHO THEY WERE 
WITH GIVING US DETAILED PICTURE 
OF THEIR LIVES 
WE WENT BACK TO PARENTS AND 
CHILDREN FOR COMMENTS ON WHAT WE 
FILMED FILMED TONIGHT WE WILL BE FOCUSING ON SIX 
OF OUR CHILDREN 
WILLIAM WILLIAM YEAH WILLIAM WILLIAM YEAH ARE YOU GOING TO BE A GOOD LITTLE 
BOY NO CHARLOTTE BOY NO CHARLOTTE MATTHEW MATTHEW PARIS PARIS CHARLIE CHARLIE HELLO HELLO AND ETHAN 
LORD WINSTON IS HERE 
NICE TO SEE YOU 
IT IS SUCH LOVELY SERIES ONE LOVE 
THIS SERIES BECAUSE WE KNOW THEM SO 
WELL NOW 
THEY ARE QUITE FRIENDLY IT IS 
QUITE SPECIAL IT IS VERY 
PRIVILEGED THING TO BE PART OF THAT 
TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME WHICH WE HAVE 
SEEN A BIT OF IS ABOUT STRESS AND 
TODAY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT EXAM 
STRESS AND SOME OF THEM ARE FEELING 
IT AREN'T THEY 
WE POINT OUT THAT 
KIDS BY THE TIME THEY THEY REACH 
YOUNG ADULTS WILL HAVE TAKEN ONE HUNDRED 
EXAMS IT IS DUBIOUS WHERE EIGHT 
YEAR OLDS SHOULD BE TAKING EXAMS L. 
CONDITION SEE THE RELEVANCE AS WE 
SEE REBECCA PREPARING FOR S. A. T.'S AND 
IN THIS PROGRAMME AND THE STRESS 
THAT SHE IS PUT THROUGH SHE DOES 
FINE AS IT TURNS OUT 
SHE IS A BRIGHT LITTLE GIRL BUT IT 
DOES SEEM A PRETTY POOR WAY OF 
ASSESSING A CHILD'S AABILITY REALLY 
WE HAVE DIFFERENT PROGRAMME THE 
WAY CHILDREN EXPRESS THEIR STRESS 
IS DRAWING IN ART 
YEAH WE USE 
DRAWING TO DEMONSTRATE THAT AND 
THEY DRAW SOME SPIKY RED STRESSFUL 
LOOKING DRAWINGS AND WE WE GET THE 
PARENTS TO DO THE SAME AND SEE 
WHETHER THINGS ARE SIMILAR 
WE ASKED OUR FAMILIES TO DRAW 
PICTURE OF STRESS AND ALEX SEEMED 
LAID BACK 
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING 
UNLIKE HIS MUM 
THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE IN MY 
HEAD WHEN I AM STRESSED 
HE IS REALLY ANGRY AND HIS FACE IS 
RED RED IT IS WHAT I DO WHEN I'M REALLY 
STRESSED AND I GO ARRGH AND I 
SCREAM SCREAM HE IS TWO THINGS BEING MEAN TO ME 
HE IS DESPERATE FOR THE TOILET 
THE COMBINATION OF SOMEBODY 
POINTING A GUN AT ME AND BEING ON 
THE ROOF OF BLOCK OF FLATS I 
WOULD FIND EXTREMELY STRESSFUL 
THAT'S A BILL BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I 
SEEM TO RECEIVE EVERY DAY AND I 
ONLY GET A PAY SLIP ONCE A MONTH SO 
THAT'S NOT FAIR 
THAT'S REBECCA'S MOTHER WHAT IS 
INTERESTING THE STRESS THE CHILDREN 
FEEL SOMETIMES THEY FEEL STRESSED 
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEIR PARENTS ARE 
STRESSED EVEN THOUGH THE PARENTS 
ARE TRYING TO HIDE IT 
IN REBECCA'S CASE SHE FELT UNDER 
PRESSURE BECAUSE HER OLDER BROTHER 
IT IS CONFIDENT AND GOOD AT EXAMS 
SHOWS OFF A BIT AND HE SEEMS TO BE 
A STRONG CHARACTER AND I THINK SHE 
FEELS SHE HAS TO EMULATE HIM BUT 
THE STRESS IS CAUSED BY ILLNESS IN 
ONE CHILD'S CASE EVE'S AND 
TALLISON WHO WAS BULLIED AT SCHOOL 
AND BULLYING IS PROBLEM WE 
HAVEN'T CONTROLLED THE ISSUES IN 
THE UNICEF REPORT WHICH SUGGESTED 
THAT BRITISH CHILDREN ARE SUBJECTED 
TO MORE BULLYING THAN ALMOST ANY 
OTHER CHILDREN IN DEVELOPED 
COUNTRIES WE SCORE REALLY BADLY 
OUT OF TWENTY ONE COUNTRIES WE HAVEN'T 
CONTROLLED THAT PROPERLY 
ARE CHILDREN TODAY MORE STRESSED 
OUT THAN THEY WERE SAY A GENERATION 
AGO WHEN I WAS A CHILD I USED TO 
WORRY ALL THE TIME AND IF THERE 
WASN'T ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT I 
WOULD PROBABLY FIND SOMETHING TO 
WORRY ABOUT WOULD IT BE WORSE IF I 
WAS A CHILD TODAY 
I REMEMBER BEING 
FULL OF ANXIETY ABOUT SCHOOL IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO MAKE THE COMPARISONS 
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHETHER 
CHILDREN ARE MORE STRESSED BUT WE 
ARE RECOGNISING SOME OF THE 
PROBLEMS WHICH WE DIDN'T BEFORE 
HOW DO YOU TALK TO CHILDREN WHO ARE 
STRESSED ABOUT EXAMS THIS IS 
SOMETHING WE ARE LOOKING AT TODAY 
AND WATCHING THE PROGRAMME TONIGHT 
AND REBECCA YOU WERE SAYING REALLY 
KEENLY FEELS THE STRESS OF EXAMS 
BECAUSE SHE IS A PERFECTIONIST AND 
BECAUSE OF HER BROTHER AS A PARENT 
WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO CHILDREN TO 
ELIMB NAT THE STRESS IN ELIMINATE 
THE STRESS IN THEIR LIVES FIRST 
FIRST OF ALL IS TO LISTEN TO THEM AND THE 
SECOND THING IS TO MAKE SURE THEIR 
SELF ESTEEM IS MAINTAINED CHILDREN 
WHO ARE TRYING HARD SHOULD FEEL 
REWARDED IF THEY ARE NOT TRYING 
THAT'S A DIFFERENT ISSUE BUT ULT 
MALTLY ULTIMATELY ONE HAS TO TO 
BUT THAT IN A FOCUS WHAT CAN 
HAPPEN WITH A CHILD SOME CHILDREN 
LIKE REBECCA MIGHT FEEL REALLY 
DEVASTATED BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T 
DONE VERY WELL AS IT TURNS OUT SHE 
DOES EXTREMELY WELL AS WE SEE AT 
THE END OF THE PROGRAMME BUT THE 
THE SELF HE IS SEEM OF THE CHILD IS 
ESTEEM IS IMPORTANT THAT'S 
PUBLISHED BY LISTENING AND BY 
REWARDING AND WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN 
THAT LACK SELF ESTEEM TEND TO BE 
DEPRESSED LATER ON IN LIFE 
HOW DID YOU FIND SUCH WINNING 
CHILDREN THEY ARE ALL LOVELY THEY 
ARE FUNNY AND CHARMING AND THEY ARE 
WARM AND THEY ARE MOVING SOME OF 
THE THINGS THEY SAY AS WELL NOW 
NOT ALL CHILDREN CAN BE LIKE THAT 
THESE CHILDREN RANDOMLY CHOSEN 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND 
WE HAD NO IDEA HOW THEY WOULD TURN 
OUT ALL CHILDREN HAVE THE 
CAPABILITY OF BEEN WINNING 
ENTHUSIASTIC AND CHARMING 
HOW LONG 
ARE THEY GOING TO STAY YOUR 
FRIENDS 
THAT IS AN INTERESTING FRIENDS QUESTION IF WE WANT TO FOLLOW UP 
THEY MIGHT SAY WE DON'T WANT TO DO 
THAT ANYMORE THAT IS AN ETHICAL 
ISSUE FOR US WE HAVE TO ACCEPT 
THERE AUTONOMY AND IT MAY BE THE 
MAIN NOT WANT TO TAKE PART ANY 
LONGER SO FAR NONE OF THE 
FAMILIES HAVE PULLED OUT 
IT IS NOT 
SENTIMENTAL IN ANY WAY WHEN YOU 
ARE MOVED BY IT IT IS BECAUSE OF 
WHAT THEY ARE SAYING AND THEY ARE 
NOT TRYING TO BE MANIPULATIVE 
THERE ARE SOME TOUGH STORIES A LOT 
OF THESE KIDS HAVE COME THROUGH 
REAL HARDSHIP OFTEN HORRIFYING 
THINGS I WON'T TALK ABOUT IT ONE 
STORY WE WILL SEE ON WEDNESDAY 
EVENING IS A VERY SAD STORY IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO WATCH 
NICE TO SEE YOU THANKS FOR COMING 
IN THIS MORNING 
IT IS AN B. B. C. ONE ON WEDNESDAY AT 
EIGHT P. M. EIGHT P. M. TIME FOR A LOOK AT THE WEATHER IT 
HAS BEEN LOVELY FOR THE PAST COUPLE 
OF DAYS 
IT IS ALREADY PLEASANTLY WARM 
OUTSIDE AND FOR MANY IT IS SUNNY 
AT THE END OF THE WEEK 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE CLOSER TO WHAT 
WE WOULD EXPECT AT THIS TIME OF 
YEAR THEY WILL BE BACK INTO THE 
TEAMS INSTEAD OF THE MID TO HIGH 
TWENTIES THERE IS SOME CLOUD AROUND 
THIS MORNING ACROSS SCOTLAND 
NORTHERN IRELAND IN PARTICULAR AND 
THAT IS PRODUCING SHALL REMAIN 
SOME THUNDERSTORMS AS WELL BUT IT 
WILL DIE OUT THROUGH THE COURSE OF 
THE DAY CLOSE TO THE EAST COAST WE 
DO HAVE LOWER CLOUD PARTS OF 
YORKSHIRE HAVE A HOLE IN THAT CLOUD 
SO SUNSHINE THERE CURRENTLY FOR 
THE REST OF ENGLAND FAIR WEATHER 
CLOUDS AND LOTS OF SUNSHINE AS WE 
HAVE IN LONDON AND BRIGHTON AND IN 
EXETER IT IS A VERY SIMILAR STORY 
GOING ACROSS THE BRISTOL CHANNEL 
INTO WALES A FAIR BIT OF SUNSHINE 
AROUND FOR NORTHERN IRELAND LIKE 
WESTERN SCOTLAND THERE IS MORE 
CLOUD AND IT IS PRODUCING SHOWERS 
BUT IT IS AN IMPROVING PICTURE 
SONNY MIST AND FOG PATCHES WILL 
BURN A WAY BACK TO THE COAST 
ALTHOUGH PARTS OF THE NORTH EAST OF 
ENGLAND COULD HANG ON TO THE LOW 
CLOUD DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY 
IF THAT HAPPENS THAT COULD HOLD 
DOWN THE TEMPERATURES MOVE FURTHER 
WEST AND IT IS ANOTHER CRACKER 
OVERNIGHT THERE WILL BE CLEARANCE 
IN THE SKY MOST OF THE SHOW WAS 
TRYING A WAY BUT WE WILL SEE THE 
LOW CLOUD MIST AND FOG COME IN OFF 
THE NORTH SEA PERHAPS AS FAR WEST 
AS THE PENNINES NOT THE COLD NIGHT 
IN PROSPECT AND NOT A COLD START TO 
THE DAY TOMORROW UNLIKE TODAY WE 
WILL HAVE A NORTH EASTERLY BREEZE 
WHICH IS COMING FROM A COLD A 
DIRECTION SO IT WILL FEEL COOLER 
TOMORROW BUT A LOOK AT THOSE 
TEMPERATURES NOTHING WRONG WITH 
THEM 
IT IS CALLED AND THE BEAST 
IT IS LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE SEEN 
BEFORE IT IS A SIX HEADED GUITAR 
AND THE ONLY TWELVE OF THEM HAVE BEEN 
MADE THE MAN WHO MADE THE FIRST 
ONE IS WITH US THIS MORNING AND HE 
KNOWS HOW TO PLAY IT DON'T YOU 
SOMEONE HAS TO 
THIS IS NOT THE SORT OF GUITAR YOU 
BITE TO PLAY YOU BUY IT TO LOOK AT 
IT ALL TALK ABOUT IT 
IT IS A

IDEAS AND THINGS ARE HAPPENING WITH

AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE SHOP IT AS WELL IT IS FIFTY YEARS OLD 
IT IS 
JUST DO SOME ON EXERCISE SO YOU CAN 
REACH THE BOTTOM 
THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES MAKE THE MOST 
OF THE WEEKEND WARM WEATHER DID 
YOU HAD TO THE BEACH BUT FOR THOSE 
WITH YOUNG CHILDREN KEEPING TRACK 
OF THEM BY THE SEASIDE IS NOT EASY 
BOURNEMOUTH HAS A TODDLER TAGGING 
SCHEME ON ITS BEACHES AND MORE 
COUNCILS ARE BEING ENCOURAGED TO 
USE THE COLOUR CODED SYSTEM TO 
REUNITE PARENTS WITH THEIR CHILDREN 
IF THEY LOSE THEM NICOLA IS ON THE 
BEACH NOW 
GOOD MORNING 
IT IS ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL MORNING AT 
BOURNEMOUTH I HAD JUST PUT MY 
SUNTAN LOTION ON THERE ARE TWO 
WOMEN WANDERING ALONG THE BEACH IN 
A BIKINI THE REASON PEOPLE COME TO 
THIS BEACH IN PARTICULAR IS BECAUSE 
THEY HAVE THIS WRISTBAND SCHEME 
PARENTS WRITE THEM MOBILE NUMBERS 
ON THERE AND IF THEIR CHILDREN ARE 
LOST WHOEVER FINDS THEM CAN CALL 
THE PARENTS AND LET THEM KNOW THEY 
ARE O. K. THEY HAVE THIS AND SEVERAL 
OTHER AREAS OF THE U. K. AND THEY ARE 
HOPING MORE WILL FOLLOW SUIT AND I 
SPENT THE WEEKEND IN EASTBOURNE 
THESE TWO CHILDREN ARE THE SAME AGE 
AND ON THE SAME BEACH BUT THERE IS 
A SMALL DIFFERENCE EMILY ONE OF 
THE FOUR MILLION VISITORS TO 
EASTBOURNE OF THE YEAR IS WEARING 
A WRISTBAND WITH HER PARENTS 
CONTACT DETAILS ON SO IF SHE GETS 
LOST WHOEVER FINDS HER AND GET IN 
TOUCH WITH HER PARENTS IMMEDIATELY 
THE COLOUR MATCHES A COLLARED ZONE 
ON THE BEACH WHERE HER FAMILY IS 
LOCATED THAT THE CORRECT LOCATED IS THAT THE CORRECT NUMBER 
THAT LOOKS RIGHT WHAT NUMBER WHAT HANDY YOU WANT IT ON 
IT RELOCATES THE CHILD WITH THE 
PARENTS QUICKLY THE FACT WE CAN 
GET HOLD OF THEM INSTANTLY CAUSES 
LESS DISTRESS FOR THE CHILD AND 
PARENT 
LAST YEAR THE RNLI SAYS PARENT IT'S LIKE GUARDS REUNITED EIGHT HUNDRED SEVEN LOST 
CHILDREN WITH THEIR PARENTS THE 
AVERAGE TIME THE CHILDREN WERE 
MISSING FORTY FIVE MINUTES 
EVEN IF YOU 
LOOK AWAY FOR A MOMENT THEY ARE 
GONE YOU CANNOT SEE THEM AGAIN SO 
IT IS SCARY 
THE PANIC YOU HAVE 
THEY GO SO QUICKLY YOU DON'T GET 
THE CHANCE TO STOP THEM AT LEAST 
WITH THAT YOU 
HAVE REASSURANCE I I HAVE FORMER GREAT GRANDCHILDREN YOU 
TODAY SO IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE I 
AM TRYING TO WATCH ALL OF THEM IN IN BOURNEMOUTH THEY HAVE INTRODUCED 
THE WRISTBANDS THE NUMBER OF 
CHILDREN REPORTED MISSING ON THE 
BEACH USED TO BE SIX HUNDRED YEAR NOW IT 
IS AROUND ONE HUNDRED SOME COUNCILS HAVE 
SIMILAR SCHEMES BUT AT THE 
POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM PARENTS IT 
IS HOPE MORE WILL INTRODUCE THE 
WRISTBANDS WRISTBANDS WE CAN TALK TO ALIGHT GUARD WITH 
THE RNLI WHAT DIFFERENCE HAS THIS 
MADE HERE BOURNEMOUTH HIGHMEAD 
THIS SCHEME 
IT MAKES IT EASIER FOR 
US TO HELP WITH MISSING CHILDREN IF 
WE ARE UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GET 
THEM WE ADVISE PARENTS WERE MADE 
HIS AT THE BEACH TO COME TO THE 
WHITE GUARD STATION PICK UP THE 
WRISTBAND PUT ON THEIR MOBILE 
NUMBER AND IF IT IS UNFORTUNATE 
ENOUGH TO BE SEPARATED THEN IT IS 
EASIER TO RELOCATE THEM 
IT MUST BE 
LIKE YOU HAVE SO MANY OTHER HELPERS 
ON THE BEACH IT IS NOT ONLY YOU 
IF OTHER PARENTS AND CHILDREN THEY 
CAN CONTACT THE PARENTS DIRECTLY 
THERE IS THAT NUMBER FOR THEM TO 
RING OR SO THEY CAN BRING THEM 
DIRECTLY TO US AND WE CAN CARRY ON 
FROM THERE 
IT HAS BEEN WELL 
RECEIVED BY PARENTS DEFINITELY DEFINITELY DEFINITELY 
WE CAN TALK TO THIS DEFINITELY FAMILY WHO ARE PLAYING IN THE SAND 
WHAT DIFFERENCE HAS THIS MADE TO 
YOU JAYNE THEY RUN OFF SO 
QUICKLY 
IT IS ADDED REASSURANCE QUICKLY YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE IF 
ANYTHING HAPPENS THEY CAN FIND A 
LIGHT GUARD OR FIND SOMEONE THEN 
YOU GET A CALL TO SAY THEY HAVE 
THEM IT IS PANIC 
WHEN YOU ARE A 
CHILD EVERY BIT OF THE BEACH LOOKS 
THE SAME 
WHEN IT IS CROWDED YOU 
CANNOT FIND THE PERSON YOU ARE 
LOOKING FOR ANYHOW SO LET ALONE 
WHEN YOU ARE A CHILD 
AND HE GOES 
OFF AT SOME SPEED DOESN'T HE HE HE HAS SOME LEGS ON HIM AT THE MOMENT 
DOES IT MAKE IT EASY TO CHOOSE A 
BEACH IF YOU KNOW THIS SORT OF 
SCHEME IS IN OPERATION DEFINITELY DEFINITELY TO HAVE OTHER PEOPLE LOOKING OUT 
AND LOOKING OUT FOR YOUR CHILDREN 
TO HAVE THE ALARM RAISED QUICKLY 
IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND I 
WOULD CHOOSE A BEACH THAT HAS THIS 
IN OPERATION 
THANKS FOR SPEAKING 
TO US THIS MORNING OTHER COUNCILS 
ARE BEING ENCOURAGED TO INTRODUCE 
THIS BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN SO 
SUCCESSFUL HERE IN BOURNEMOUTH 
IN I WAS DOWN WITH MY TODDLER IN 
EASTBOURNE EASTBOURNE SHE DID NOT FIND ME IT IS A VERY 
STONY BEACH SO MY TODDLER DOES NOT 
GO FAR 
THE TIME IS NEARLY NINE O'CLOCK AM SHE 
TOUGHED IT OUT TO SURVIVE THE 
SEEING OFF SINCE I DO ANYTHING SHE 
KEPT SMILING DESPITE HARSH 
CRITICISM BUT LAST NIGHT ASHLEY'S 
LOOK AND SUPPORT RAN OUT WHEN 
ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER FAILED TO SAVE 
HER HER HE DID SAY HE WOULD LIKE TO WORK 
WITH HER IN THE FUTURE BUT DOESN'T 
HE SAY THAT TO EVERYBODY 
NOT EVERYBODY 
WE WILL ASK THE DRAMA TEACHER FROM 
COLKIRK TO FIND OUT WHAT IT WAS 
LIKE TO REACH THE LAST SIX 
ANDREW YOU MUST DECIDE 
WHO WE YOU SAVE 
IT IS A VERY WEIRD 
SEEING OFF BECAUSE WE HAVE NIEVE 
THE YOUNG GIRLS SINGING A SONG 
WHICH IS THE POLITICAL SONG ABOUT A 
WOMAN WHO IS GIVING A SPEECH IT IS 
A BIT CYNICAL AND ARTS AND I WISH I 
HAD ACTING TIME WITH YOU ODD L. 
FIND THIS VERY HARD BECAUSE NIEVE 
WAS A LITTLE YOUNG FOR THIS L. L. WAS 
VERY HARD ON YOU ASHLEY IN THE END 
I HAVE GOT TO SAVE ME 
THAT MEANS ASHLEY IS HERE ON THE 
SOFA SOFA YOU KIND OF KNEW IT WAS COMING 
ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER HAS NOT BEEN 
YOUR BIGGER SUPPORTER HAS HE 
NIAAM IS ONE OF ANDREW'S FAVOURITES 
HE SAID YOU DON CONNECT WITH 
DON'T CONNECT WITH THE WORDS IT 
WASN'T NICE WAS IT 
I THOUGHT HE 
COULD HAVE BEEN MORE CLEVER WITH 
WHAT HE SAID 
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO WORK WITH 
THAT BECAUSE IT IS NOT CONSTRUCTIVE 
IT IS NOT YOU NEED TO WORK ON YOUR 
VOCAL QUALITY IT WAS A KIND OF 
TABLOID HEADLINE I THOUGHT I 
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO 
ARE THEY THE SONGS YOU CHOOSE 
THERE IS A BIT OF BOTH WHEN YOU 
START YOU PUT IN A LIST SO THEY 
PICK AND CHOOSE BUT I DID A WITNEY 
A BARBRA STREISAND AND I THINK I 
ACHIEVED THEM 
LET'S LISTEN 
AND EVER WE NEVER WILL 
PART PART TO LEAVE WOULD ONLY BE HEARTBREAK 
FOR ME 
MY DARLING BELIEVE ME 
FOR ME THERE IS NO ONE BUT YOU 
ANSWER MY PRAYER NOW BABY GOOD GOOD NOTE NOTE THE CHARGE WAS YOU JUST WEREN'T 
GIVING OF YOURSELF ENOUGH WHERE IS 
THE PASSION IS THE PHRASE THAT SOME 
OF HEARD A LOT BEFORE 
I MEAN 
THAT'S EVERYONE HAS GOT AN 
OPINION ON EVERYTHING AND AS LONG 
AS YOU CAN SING FROM YOUR HEART AND 
BE TRUTHFUL TO YOURSELF 
WERE YOU 
I THINK ABSOLUTELY I WAS 
JOHN BARRYMAN KEPT SAYING YOU WERE 
CHEESY 
EVERYONE HAS OPINIONS AND CHEESY IT IS EASY TO LOSURE IDENTITY IN A 
COMPETITION COMPETITION LOSE YOUR 
IDENTITY IN A COMPETITION LIKE THAT 
WHAT WILL YOU TAKE FROM BEING IN 
IT 
I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT MYSELF IT AND I THINK YOU KNOW 
WHAT HAVE 
YOU LEARNED 
I'M STRONGER THAN I 
THOUGHT I I WAS TO TAKE THE 
CRITICISMS I DID AND AND OFFERING 
THEM SOMETHING ELSE AND I PROVED 
QUITE A LOT YOU KNOW STRENGTH OF 
CHARACTER WHICH I JUST DIDN'T THINK 
I HAD 
I I THINK OF ALL OF THEM YOU CAME 
ACROSS AS A REAL FIGHTER THERE YOU 
WERE IN THE BOTTOM TWO AGAIN AND IT 
IS AND YOU CAME BACK AND EVERYONE 
WAS WEEPING WHEN YOU WERE DOING 
THAT FINAL SONG

WAS THIS SIXTEEN YEAR OLD WHO DIED IN AN 
UNPROVOKED ATTACK ON SATURDAY HE 
WAS JUST GOING TO BAKERY ELEVEN HUNDRED A M. 
ON SATURDAY MORNING AND WAS KILLED 
BY A THUG BASICALLY WIELDING A BIT 
OF GLASS IT SEEMS THAT VIOLENCE 
AGAINST TEENAGERS HAS BECOME A 
FREQUENT EVENT 
THE SUBJECT OF KNIFE CRIME IS TO BE 
EXPLORED IN A PLAY ON THE WEST END 
STAGE ONE OF THE STARS IS DENISE 
BLACK YOU WILL REMEMBER HER FROM 
HER ROLE IN CORONATION STREET AND 
DENISE IS 
HERE THIS MORNING 
IT IS SUCH TRAGIC BACKGROUND BUT 
TELL US ABOUT THE PLAY THAT YOU ARE 
DOING 
I'M DOING A PLAY AND IT IS DOING GOING OUT AT THE SOHO THEATRE IT 
IS CALLED THE LONG ROAD AND IT IS 
ABOUT FORGIVENESS OF THE FAMILY OF 
THE SON WHO DIED AND THE GIRL WHO 
DOES THE KNIFE ATTACK THAT'S 
BROUGHT ON BY THE FORGIVENESS 
PROJECT AND WE OPENED IN PRISON 
YESTERDAY YESTERDAY DID YOU 
ON SATURDAY 
HOW DID THAT GO 
IT WENT EXTREMELY 
WELL L. HAVE NOT BEEN SO NERVOUS 
SINCE CORONATION STREET TERRIFYING 
THE FORGIVENESS PROJECT IS WHAT 
THIS IS THIS JOURNALIST MARINA IF 
YOU LOOK ON THE WEB FOR THE 
FORGIVENESS PROJECT YOU WILL SEE 
IT IS STORIES BETWEEN THE VICTIMS 
OF TRAUMATIC LOSS AND PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE DONE IT MURDERERS AND THEIR 
FAMILIES ESSENTIALLY 
YOU PLAY THE MOTHER OF A TEENAGE 
SON WHO IS KILLED WE WERE SAYING 
ABOUT JIMMY MIZEN IN AN UNPROVOKED 
ATTACK WHAT WAS INTERESTING WAS 
HEARING HIS PARENTS SPEAKING OVER 
THE WEEKEND AND THEY TALKED AS IN A 
FORGIVING WAY THEY WERE TALKING 
ABOUT HOW SAD THEY FELT FOR THE 
FAMILY OF THE BOY WHO DID IT 
BECAUSE THEY GOT TO LIVE WITH THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ACT AND THAT 
FORGIVENESS SO EARLY ON JUST SEEMS 
EXTRAORDINARY 
I 
DON'T KNOW L. EXTRAORDINARY DON'T KNOW WHAT 
IT WOULD BE LIKE IF IT HAPPENED L. L. KNOW THE PATRON OF 
THIS SAYS THAT YOU DO IT FOR 
YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU GET SO GRIEF 
STRICKEN AND STRANDED IN THE RANDOM 
MEANINGLESSNESS OF LOSING SOMEONE 
YOU LOVE AND YOU NEED TO MOVE ON IN 
YOUR LIFE SOT PURPOSE OF IT IS NOT 
REALLY SOMETHING ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT 
HELP THE THE PERSON WHO DID IT 
THERE WAS A WOMAN IN PRISON ON 
SATURDAY WHO HAD STABBED HER 
BOYFRIEND AND SHE SAID HER FATHER 
WANTED TO TAKE HER TO A WEST ENSHOW 
AND SHE WANTED TO BRING HIM TO SEE 
THIS ONE L. PRESUMED THE ISSUES 
WITHIN THE FAMILY OF THE MURDERER 
ARE MASSIVE ISSUES AREN'T THEY HOW HOW HAVE YOU APPROACHED THE ROLE I I JUST TRIED REALLY HARD NOT TO WEEP 
ALL THE TIME WE MET A LADY CALLED 
MARIEIAN WHO VISITS PRISONS HER 
SISTER LUCY WAS A VICTIM OF THE 
WEST'S WEST'S FREDERICK WEST YES YES I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE COPED WITH IT 
BUT SHE FOUND FORGIVENESS 
SHE SAYS IT IS GOES ON FOR THE REST 
OF YOUR LIFE AND SOMETIMES YOU FEEL 
ANGRY BUT OUR KIDS I'VE GOT KIDS 
AND MOST PARENTS WITH KIDS THEY 
HAVE EITHER SEEN A KNIFE SOMEBODY 
HAS SHOWN THEM A KNIFE OR 
THREATENED THEM WITH A KNIFE OR 
THEY CARRY AN ISSUE 
HOW OLD ARE YOURS 
NINE ARE NINETEEN AND 
SEVENTEEN BUT MY SON HAD SEEN TWO KNIVES 
BY THE AGE OF TWELVE THREATENED WITH 
TWO KNIVES BY THE AGE OF OF TWELVE 
IN LONDON WAS THIS

THINK IT COULD BE ANYWHERE 
WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT THE CASE OF 
JIMMY MIZEN IT GIVES EVERY PARENT 
PAUSE FOR THOUGHT YOU STOP AND 
THINK GOSH WHAT IF IT HAPPENED TO 
US 
IT IS A HUGE ISSUE AND NEEDS US TO BE TALKED ABOUT L. MEAN YOUR 
HEART GOES OUT DOESN'T IT THE 
FIRST THING YOU WOULD SEE YOU 
WOULD NEVER RECOVER IT IS A 
TERRIBLE THING 
WHAT WAS EXTRAORDINARY WAS THE 
STRENGTH OF MARGARET AND BARRY'S 
CHARACTER AFTER HAVING LOST 
WONDERFUL BOY IT WAS UNPROVOKED 
THERE WASN'T KNIVES INVOLVED IN 
THIS THAT THEY COULD GO ON WELL WELL THERE IS THE IDEA WHAT MARIEAN HAS
