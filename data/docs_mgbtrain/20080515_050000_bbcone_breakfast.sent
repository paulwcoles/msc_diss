SWEETER WE'LL BE FINDING OUT WHY RAIN SPREADING UP FROM THE SOUTH 
FIRST OUR MAIN STORY FIGURES 
RELEASED THIS MORNING SHOW A 
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER 
OF CRIMES COMMITTED BY GIRLS OVER 
THE LAST THREE YEARS THE 
STATISTICS RELEASED BY THE YOUTH 
JUSTICE BOARD REVEAL A TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
INCREASE IN OFFENCES BY TEN TO SEVENTEEN 
YEAR OLD GIRLS IN ENGLAND AND WALES 
LEADING TO A POLICE WARNING OR 
COURT ACTION OVER THE SAME PERIOD 
THE NUMBER OF CRIMES COMMITTED BY 
BOYS HAS FALLEN SLIGHTLY 
IT IS NO LONGER JUST A YOUNG MEN 
WHO WERE BEHAVING BADLY TODAY 
CONFIRMATION FROM THE BODY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR REDUCING YOUTH OF 
FENDED THAT GROWING NUMBERS OF 
GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN ARE BREAKING

FELT DEVASTATED THE MOST THING I 
HAD ON MY MIND WAS MY MUM I KNEW 
SHE DID NOT BRING HER CHILDREN UP

IF SOME OF THE BIGGEST INCREASES IN 
TODAY'S FIGURES INVOLVE PUBLIC 
ORDER OFFENCES AND VIOLENCE OFTEN 
CARRIED OUT BY GIRLS WHO WERE DRUNK 
THIS COMMUNITY OFFICER SAYS THAT 
THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS 
IN THE PAST WE HAVE NOT SEEN GIRLS 
SIGNIFICANTLY INVOLVED IN CRIME 
HOWEVER RECENTLY WE HAVE STEALING 
THINGS LIKE COSMETICS WHICH ARE 
EASY TO STEAL IT SEEMS A TERRIBLE 
WASTE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO ENTER THE 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND GET A 
CRIMINAL RECORD FOR STEALING 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
YOUNG PEOPLE OF EITHER SEX ARE MORE 
LIKELY TO BE A VICTIM OF CRIME AND 
TO COMMIT ONE FROM TODAY THE

MORNING ABOUT THAT STORY THAT THE 
B. B. C. WAS WAS TELLING YOU LAST NIGHT 
ABOUT THE ROYAL MAIL THIS IS THE 
FINANCIAL TIMES ITS HEADLINE QUCH 
FRESH MODEL FOR ROYAL MAIL 
FUNDING IT IS IN A NUMBER OF THE 
OTHER NEWSPAPERS THIS IS ABOUT THE 
MONEY THE POST OFFICE REGULATOR 
POST COME IS RECOMMENDING THAT PART 
OF THE ROYAL MAIL IS SOLD OFF TO 
PRIVATE INVESTORS IN OTHER WORDS 
FIRMS LIKE THE PRIVATE EQUITY 
COMPANIES ARE ALLOWED TO BUY A PART 
OF THE ROYAL MAIL THAT WILL SECURE 
FOR THE ROYAL MAIL PRIVATE FUNDING 
THIS IS GETTING EXTRA MONEY MONEY 
IN FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND 
GETTING EXTRA MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE 
IN FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO HELP 
THE ROYAL MAIL MODERNISE ITS 
BUSINESS AND COPE WITH INCREASING 
COMPETITION THE KEY FIGURE SEEMS 
TO BE SOMEWHERE IN THE REGION OF 
TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION THAT'S THE GAP IN 
ROYAL MAIL FUNDING OVER THE NEXT 
FIVE YEARS OR SO THAT HAD BEEN 
IDENTIFIED THE POST OFFICE WATCHDOG 
AND THE WATCHDOG SAYS THAT THAT GAP 
CAN REALLY ONLY FILLED BY PRIVATE 
INVESTMENT IT SAYS THE ALTERNATIVE 
IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND 
TAXPAYERS STUMP UP THAT MONEY AND 
IT SAYS IT DOESN'T THINK THAT THE 
POLITICAL WILL IS THERE FOR THAT 
SO IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT PUBLIC 
FUNDING IT SAYS THAT ROYAL MAIL 
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO SELL PART OF 
ETC SELF TO PRIVATE INVESTORS 
THERE IS NEWS FROM BARCLAYS WE 
WERE EXPECTING IT WOULD BECOME THE 
LATEST BANK TO GO TO SHAREHOLDERS 
AND ASK THEM FOR BILLIONS OF POUNDS 
WELL NOW IT IS THOUGHT THAT 
BARCLAYS WILL PUT THAT ON HOLD BUT 
WILL CUT THE VALUE OF INVESTMENTS 
IN AMERICAN MORTGAGE DEBT 
ANOTHER BANK THAT'S GONE TO 
SHAREHOLDERS LOOKING FOR MORE MONEY 
IS THE BRADFORD AND AMP BINGLEY IT SAID 
A FEW WEEKS AGO THAT IT WOULD NEED 
TO MAKE SUCH A FUND RAIDSING EFFORT 
SO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE NOW 
APOLOGISING TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR 
THAT THAT SHARES IN LONDON YESTERDAY THEY 
WERE JUST FOUR POINTS HIGHER 
THIS IS BREAKFAST FROM B. B. C. NEWS 
THE NUMBER OF CRIMES COMMITTED BY

YEARS YEARS A MAN HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH THE 
MURDER OF JIMMY MIZEN THE TEENAGER 
KILLED THE DAY AFTER HIS SIXTEENTH 
BIRTHDAY BIRTHDAY COMING UP TIM MUFFETT IS IN 
PETERBOROUGH TO FIND OUT WHY YOU 
SHOULDN'T USE YOUR LOAF WHEN IT 
COMES TO FEEDING THE BIRDS 
FEEDING THE BIRDS IS GOOD BUT NOT 
WITH BREAD IF NOT BREAD WHAT 
SHOULD BIRDS BE ENJOYING FIND OUT 
WHAT'S UNDER HERE LATER 
I'VE GOT A FEELING THE BIRDS WILL 
HAVE PLENTY TO DRINK TODAY 
THEY WILL IN SOME PARTS YOU'RE 
RIGHT IT IS WET ALREADY IT HAS 
BEEN RAINING ACROSS PARTS OF 
SOUTHERN ENGLAND SINCE YESTERDAY 
AND WE HAD SOME CRACKING 
THUNDERSTORMS YESTERDAY THE 
FORECAST FOR TODAY IS THAT THERE IS 
RAIN PUSHING FROM THE SOUTH BUT 
FOR ALL OF US IT IS GOING TO FEEL 
COOLER TODAY THAN IT HAS DONE OF 
LATE YOU CAN SEE ON THE RADAR 
PICTURE HOW THE RAIN DEVELOPED 
ABOUT TWELVE HOURS AGO TO MORE OR LESS 
THE CURRENT STATE IT IS HEAVIEST 
IN THE SOUTH WEST AND WE HAVE GOT 
SHOWERS AHEAD OF IT AS WELL AND 
THERE IS A FAIR BIT OF CLOUD BY 
NINE A M. WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT RAIN 
PUSHING ACROSS PARTS OF THE SOUTH 
EAST OF ENGLAND AT THIS END OF THE 
BAND OF RAIN IT IS LIKELY TO BE 
LIGHTER BUT FOR PARTS OF EAST 
ANGLIA AND AND LINCOLNSHIRE AND 
YORKSHIRE THERE WILL BE BREAKS IN 
THE CLOUD THE NORTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND FARING WELL FOR EASTERN 
AND CENTRAL PARTS OF SCOTLAND 
SEEING A FAIR BIT OF CLOUD PARTS 
OF THE WEST OF SCOTLAND THERE IS 
SUNSHINE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND WE 
ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOVELY DAY AT 
THE MOMENT THERE IS THERE IS MIST 
AND FOG PATCHES AROUND THEY WILL 
CLEAR AND THE SUN WILL WILL COME 
OUT THE NORTH WEST OF WALES SEEING 
SOME SUNSHINE 
IT IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE HEAVIEST 
IN THE WEST WHERE YOU SEE THE 
DARKER BLUES OR GREENS FLASH UP 
THAT'S WHERE WE CAN WE CAN EXPECT 
THE HEAVIEST BURSTS 
AS THE RAIN MOVES NORTHWARDS 
BEHIND IT THERE WILL BE A LOT OF 
CLOUD CLOUD TEMPERATURES WELL DOWN ON WHAT WE 
HAD IN THE LAST FEW DAYS SO YOU 
WILL NOTICE THAT TOO 
THROUGH THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT 
THE RAIN WIGGLES AROUND IN THE 
SOUTH AFFECTING ALES AND WALES 
AND THE AND THE MIDLANDS AND THERE 
IS QUITE A LOT OF CLOUD AND THE 
RISK OF SHOWERY OUTBREAKS OF RAIN 
LATER ON IN THE DAY TOO WE WILL 
HAVE RAIN COMING INTO THE SOUTH 
WEST WHICH WILL BE WITH US DURING 
SATURDAY ON SATURDAY WE ARE 
LOOKING AT A FAIR BIT OF CLOUD 
AROUND AND AGAIN THERE WILL BE ONE 
OR TWO BREAKS COMING THROUGH BUT 
LIKE TODAY WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME 
STIFF NORTH EASTERLY WINDS AND WE 
WILL HAVE THAT THROUGH THE WEEKEND 
AND THAT WILL TAKE THE EDGE OF THE 
TEMPERATURES THAT'S IT 
BIRDS YOU LOVE TO FEED THEM DON 
YOU YES YOU YES IN THE PAPERS YESTERDAY THERE WAS 
A LITTLE THING ABOUT BIRD LOVERS 
AND WHAT YOU SHOULD FEED THEM 
BECAUSE APPARENTLY WE HAVE BEEN 
FEEDING SCRAPS OF BREAD FOR 
GENERATIONS WILDLIFE EXPERTS ARE 
SAYING THAT MIGHT BE DOING MORE 
HARM THAN GOOD 
TIM MUFFETT IS FEEDING THE BIRDS IN 
A GARDEN IN PETERBOROUGH AND HE IS 
TELLING US THE RIGHT THINGS TO DO 
GOOD MORNING TO YOU 
WELL LIVE T. V. YOU CAN'T GET GET 
BIRDS TO LAND WHEN YOU WANT SO SO 
WE HAVE SOME BIRDS HERE THESE 
AREN'T REALMENT MORE THAN HALF THE 
POPULATION LEAVES OUT FOOD FOR 
BIRDS WHICH IS A GREAT THING BUT 
WHAT TYPE OF FOOD SHOULD WE BE 
LEAVING OUT BREAD MANY OF US 
CHUCK IT INTO THE GARDEN AND IT IS 
NOT A GOOD IDEA CONFUSION REIGNS 
GEMMA IS FROM THE R. S. P. B. COULD YOU 
EXPLAIN WHY IT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA 
TO THROW BREAD OUT 
IT IS VITAL 
THAT PEOPLE PUT BREAD OUT BREAD 
WON'T DO ANY HARM BUT WON'T HAVE A 
LOT OF NUTRITIONAL VALUE FOR BIRDS 
IF THEY FILL UP ON BREAD THEY 
DON'T EAT THE FOOD THEY SHOULD BE 
EATING 
BREAD IS A FILLER FOOD EATING IT IS THE SAME CONCEPT FOR BIRDS 
BUT THERE ARE LOADS OF HOUSEHOLD 
ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE AS EASY TO 
COME BY 
LET'S REVEAL THE BREAKFAST PLATTER 
THIS MORNING 
LOOK AT THIS 
LET'S START OFF WE HAVE FRUIT 
BISCUITS CEREAL WHY ARE THESE 
GOOD THINGS TO LEAVE OUT THEY THEY PROVIDE BIRDS WITH ENERGY AT THIS 
TIME OF YEAR THEY ARE BUSY FLYING 
BACK AND FORTH FEEDING THEIR YOUNG 
PASTA RICE OATS WE ALL HAVE THEM 
IN OUR CUPBOARDS 
EVEN IF THEY ARE SUGARY THAT 
DOESN'T MATTER 
NOTHING WITH TOO 
MUCH SUGAR OR SALT BUT BREAKFAST 
CEREALS GIVE THEM ENERGY 
CAKE 
AS LONG AS THEY ARE BROKEN UP CAKE SMALL AND LITTLE AND OFTEN IS GOOD 
FOR ALL OF US NO DIFFERENT FOR THE 
BIRDS BIRDS THIS IS GOOD TIME TO THROW OUT 
FOOD BECAUSE THEY ARE FEEDING THEIR 
YOUNG 
EVERY TIME OF YEAR IT IS YOUNG IMPORTANT TO FEED BIRDS BUT THEY 
ARE BUSY AT THIS TIME OF YEAR SO 
THEY WILL THANK YOU FOR YOU IT 
YOU CAN'T LEAVE TOO MUCH OUT 
BECAUSE OF RATS 
IF YOU LEAVE PILES 
AND AND PILES OF FOOD OUT IT MIGHT 
ATTRACT RATS IF YOU PUT A LITTLE 
BIT AT A TIME THE BIRDS WILL TAKE 
IT AND EVERYBODY WILL BE HAPPY 
THAT'S CLEARED A FEW THINGS UP IT 
IS A LOVELY THING WHEN YOU GET 
BIRDS IN THE GARDEN YOU FEEL AT 
ONE WITH NATURE TRY AND LEAVE THE 
RIGHT FOOD IF YOU CAN

SAID YESTERDAY WHEN SHE STUNNED THE 
WORLD OF TENNIS BY ANNOUNCING HER 
IMMEDIATE RETIREMENT SHE WON SEVEN 
GRAND SLAM TITLES AND FORTY ONE SINGLES 
TITLES SHE WAS IN ONE OF THE WORST 
SLUMPS OF HER CAREER THIS SEASON 
SHE PULLED OUT OF THIS WEEK'S 
ITALIAN OPEN BLAMING FATIGUE 
I TOOK MY DECISION AND THAT WAS IT 
WHEN I DECIDE SOMETHING I DO IT THE 
RIGHT WAY WON THE FRENCH OPEN 
FOUR TIMES L. DO NOT HAVE TO LIVE 
AT THE MOMENT AGAIN L. KNOW HOW IT 
WAS AND I KNOW I WAS LUCKY TO HAVE 
THAT MOMENT LAST YEAR WAS THE BEST 
FRENCH OPEN I COULD DREAM OF IT 
WAS AWESOME IT WAS A GREAT FEELING 
AND I AM WICKETKEEPERS FEELING FOR 
EVER EVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND HE MURRAY IS TWENTY ONE 
TODAY ANDY MURRAY HE PLAYS 
RAFAEL NADAL IN THE SECOND ROUND OF 
THE HAMBURG MASTERS ANDY LAWRIE 
BEAT GILLES SIMON YESTERDAY MORI 
HE SAYS HE IS NOT EXPECTING TO BEAT 
NADAL AT ALL WHAT CONFERENCE GOING 
INTO HER NEXT MATCH THAT IS THE 
SPORT FOR NOW L. SUPPOSE WE ARE 
REFLECTING ON A DISAPPOINTING NIGHT 
ALL ROUND FOR RANGERS NOT ONLY ON 
THE PITCH DID THEY LOSE BUT NOW 
THIS HORRENDOUS SCENES IT WILL 
LEAVE SCAR AND BRITISH FOOTBALL 
IN COLLECTORS IN NORWICH REFUSED TO 
COLLECT CABIN BELONGING TO AND NINETY SIX 
YEAR OLD SECOND WORLD WAR VETERAN 
BECAUSE IT CONTAINED TWO GLASS 
BOTTLES COLLECT A BEING NORWICH 
CITY COUNCIL 
YOU MUST NOT PUT 
ANYTHING ANYTHING THE COUNCIL SAID WE HAVE GOT TO 
SAVE 
THE PLANET L. SAID HE SAVED THE PLANET HE SERVED FIVE YEARS IN 
WORLD WAR TWO SHE SAID I'M SORRY 
THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO IS PUT AN 
ASSISTANT ON SO THAT IN FUTURE THEY 
COLLECT THE BEEN RATHER THAN IN 
TAKE IT OUT IT IS BAD ENOUGH IN 
TRYING TO TAKE THAT BEING OUTSIDE 
THE BEING 
JUST ONE OF THE MANY PROBLEMS 
PEOPLE HAVE WITH RUBBISH PETER 
ROBINSON IS DIRECTOR OF RECYCLING 
CHARITY WASTE WATCH LENNY WAS 
CONFUSED BY HIS NEW MACHINE HE PUT 
A KETCHUP BOTTLE IN THE WRONG PLANE 
SURELY HAVE BEEN PENALISED 
I THINK IT IS A BIT UNFORTUNATE 
I'M SURE THE COUNCIL CONCERNED 
PROBABLY FEEL LIKE THEY COULD HAVE 
DONE BETTER PARTICULARLY FOR LA NI 
WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO DO THE 
RIGHT THING THAT IS THE MOST IS AT 
UPSETTING ASPECT L. THINK ALSO IT 
IS IMPORTANT THAT THE COUNCIL COULD 
HAVE HELPED THEM HAD HE KNOWN THERE 
WAS HELP AVAILABLE THE COUNCIL DID 
NOT KNOW HE NEEDED HELP HE DID NOT 
KNOW THE COUNCIL WERE ABLE TO HELP 
THEM IT IS TO DO WITH 
COMMUNICATION COMMUNICATION WE HAD THE ISSUE COUPLE OF WEEKS 
AGO WITH THE FAMILY IS RUBBISH WAS 
NO LONGER COLLECTED BECAUSE THE 
PAIN WAS OPENED BY FEW INCHES 
WHY HAVE WE GOT THIS POLICE STAYED 
WITH REGARD TO RUBBISH COLLECTION 
DE THERE ARE ISOLATED INCIDENTS IT 
IS SYMPTOMATIC OF THE FACT WE'RE 
GOING THROUGH RAPID CHANGE IT HOW 
WE DEAL WITH OUR WASTE IN HOW WE 
DEAL WITH OUR WASTE SOME OF THESE 
ISSUES ARE PART OF THIS RAPID 
PROCESS OF CHANGE THE KEY TO IT 
ALL IS HOW WE COMMUNICATE WITH THE 
RESIDENTS SO THEY UNDERSTAND HOW TO 
USE THE SERVICE BETTER GOOD 
COMMUNICATION HELPS A GREAT DEAL 
IF THE COLLECTION GREW IN THIS 
PARTICULAR INSTANCE HAD GOT SOME 
TRAINING IN CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR 
EXAMPLE MAYBE THEY WOULD HAVE 
KNOCKED ON THE DOOR SPOKEN TO THE 
GENTLEMAN CONCERNED RATHER THAN PUT 
IN A STICKER ON THE BIN 
THEY WOULD ARGUE THEY HAVE TO DO 
THEIR JOB 
THEY HAVE BUT AT TIMES LIKE THIS 
WHEN THE SERVICE IS CHANGING 
SPENDING MORE TIME INVESTING 
TO AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ARE ALL 
PAYING CUSTOMERS IT IS THAT 
EXACTLY GOOD CLIENT SERVERS IS IT 
THAT IS RIGHT BUT THERE IS A LOT 
OF PRESSURE ON THE SERVICE 
PROVIDERS AT THE MOMENT 
PARTICULARLY WHEN GOING THROUGH 
THESE CHANGES PERHAPS THE GAP 
COULD BE BREACHED IN TERMS OF 
COMMUNICATION COMMUNICATION AT THERE ANY RULES AND REGULATIONS 
IF THE BEEN DOES NOT CLOSE ARE 
THERE ANY RULES AND REGULATIONS 
ARE BEEN COLLECTORS NOT OBLIGED TO 
TAKE AT BEEN IF IT IS NOT CLOSE 
FULLY FULLY THERE ARE REGULATIONS TO DIRECT THE 
WAY THAT RESIDENTS USE THE SERVICE 
THE IF THE LEAGUE DOES NOT CLOSE 
PROPERLY THEY ARE ENTITLED NOT TO 
TAKE IT IF HE'D BEEN LEAGUE 
THE LEAGUE DOES NOT CLOSE ON THE 
RECYCLING BINS THEY CAN REFUSE TO 
LET THAT AS WELL 
AND HAD NOT HEARD OF THAT IT 
SURPRISES ME BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET 
THE MAXIMUM RECYCLING WE CAN WE 
NEED TO PROVIDE RECEPTACLES OF THE 
RIGHT SIZE TO TAKE THE RECYCLING 
AVAILABLE AVAILABLE IT IS ALL ABOUT COMMUNICATION 
THE MAIN STORIES THE NUMBER OF 
CRIMES COMMITTED BY GIRLS IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES HAS INCREASED BY

SOME AREAS WE HAVE HAD ZERO 
CENTIMETRES OF RAIN IT WILL BE 
COOLER TODAY FOR SOME OF US 
COMPARED TO THE FIGURES WE HAD LAST 
WEEKEND WHEN WE REACHED THE DIZZY 
HEIGHTS OF TWENTY SEVEN CELSIUS OR TWENTY EIGHT CELSIUS 
TODAY AT BEST WE ARE LOOKING AT SIXTEEN 
CELSIUS OR SEVENTEEN CELSIUS THE FORECAST 
IS COOLER WITH RAIN YOU CAN SEE 
HOW THE RAIN GATHERED TWELVE HOURS AGO 
TO MORE OR LESS THE CURRENT PICTURE 
IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND BY NINE A M. THAT 
RAIN BAND WILL BE SHOWING ITS HAND 
IN THE SOUTH EAST THIS END OF THE 
RAIN BAND WILL BE LIGHTER AND 
PATCHIER COMPARED TO WHAT WE HAVE 
GOT IN THE SOUTH WEST THERE WILL 
BE BREAKS AROUND EAST ANGLIA INTO 
PARTS OF LINCOLNSHIRE WE HAVE GOOD 
BREAKS ACROSS YORKSHIRE BUT UP THE 
CENTRAL SWATHE OF THE PENNINES WE 
HAVE THE CLOUD AND ACROSS CENTRAL

CLEAR AND GORGEOUS DAY FOR 
NORTHERN IRELAND TODAY AND FAB 
START FOR THE NORTH WEST OF WALES 
AS WE PUSH FURTHER SOUTH ACROSS 
WALES AND INTO THE SOUTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE 
LOOKING AT HEAVY DOWNPOURS WE HAD 
CRACKING THUNDERSTORMS LAST NIGHT

COULD HEAR THE ODD RUMBLE OF 
THUNDER BEHIND THE RAIN BAND THERE 
WILL BE CLOUD AND WHERE IT BREAKS

SHARP SHOWERS DEVELOP THROUGH THIS 
EVENING AND OVERNIGHT THE BAND OF 
RAIN WIGGLES ACROSS WALES THE 
MIDLANDS AND THE SOUTH EASTERN 
CORNER THAT THAT'S WHERE IT WILL BE 
WITH US THROUGH TOMORROW TOMORROW

THE BEST BREAKS IN THE FAR NORTH OF 
SCOTLAND TEMPERATURES DOWN ON WHAT 
WE HAD LAST WEEKEND

NORTH EASTERLY WIND SO THE

WILL CLEAR DURING SATURDAY AND 
LATER ON IN SATURDAY TOO THERE 
WILL ABFAIR BIT OF CLOUD AROUND AND 
TEMPERATURES AGAIN IN THE RANGE TEN 
TO FIFTEEN CELSIUS AND THAT'S HOW IT IS

GOODBYE TO SUMMER ARE WE 
YOU KNOW 
THAT OLD EXPRESSION BILLY NEVER 
CAST A CLOUT UNTIL MAY IS OUT 
IN SOME PARTS OF THE NORTH WE COULD 
HAVE FROST

MAY MAY STEADY ON GIRL IT IS ONLY SIX HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT 
HAD NO PLANS TO TAKE ANY CLOTHES 
OFF AT ALL 
I REALLY WISH WE HADN'T START THIS 
NOW BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
CAROL THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
YOU SEE I THOUGHT A CLOUT WAS ONE 
OF OF THOSE WHICH I THOUGHT YOU 
WERE GOING TO GET 
LET'S SEE WHAT DECLAN HAS THERE IS 
A LOT OF DOOM AND GLOOM 
TEMPTING AS THOUGH IT IS TO 
INTERPRET A CLOUT AS A GOOD SLAP 
AROUND THE EAR L. THOUGHT MY DEAR 
DEAD GRANNY WAS IN THE STUDIO 
BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING SHE 
ALWAYS SAID TO US EVERY MAY 
SHE SAID KEEP YOUR YOUR WINTER 
CLOTHES ON UNTIL 
IS OUT 
HERE IS THE DAILY MAIL TOUGH TIMES 
AHEAD ON HOUSING MORTGAGES AND PAY 
AND ON GROWTH 
AHEAD ON HOUSING MORTGAGES AND PAY AND ON GROWTH 
AND ON GROWTH PETROL PRICES HIT A RECORD EVERY 
DAY NOW ALL THIS FOLLOWS ON FROM 
COMMENTS FROM THE MAN IN CHARGE OF 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND YESTERDAY 
MERVYN KING SAYING PRICES WILL RISE 
MORE SHARPLY THIS YEAR AND WILL 
STAY HIGH GIVING US TWO YEARS OF 
ECONOMIC PAIN NOW WE ALL KNOW OF 
COURSE THAT THE PRICES THAT ARE 
GOING UP FASTEST OF ALL ARE THE 
PRICES OF FOOD AND FUEL AND PETROL 
AND HOME HEATING AND THAT IS 
SQUEEZING EVERYONE'S BUDGET BUT 
PARTICULARLY THE BUDGET OF 
PENSIONERS BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE 
THINGS THEY TEND TO BUY MOST OF 
THEY'RE RISING FASTEST IN PRICE 
BUT THEIR INCOME IS STILL FIXED SO 
THAT'S PENSIONERS LIKE BREAKFAST 
VIEWERS OF JIM AND MARY WRIGHT 
I AM EIGHTY SIX AND AND I HAVE BEEN RETIRED 
SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO L. LIVE WITH MY WIFE 
MARY AND I'M AMAZED AT HOW THE 
PRICES HAVE GONE UP IN THE LAST TWO 
OR THREE YEARS AND MORE SO IN THE 
LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS THE PRICE OF OIL 
HAS GONE UP AND THE GROCERY BILLS 
HAVE GONE UP WE BUDGET A CERTAIN 
AMOUNT OF MONEY PER MONTH WITH A 
SUPERMARKET WHICH WE NOW FIND IT 
BARELY SEES THE MONTH OUT OUR 
PENSION GOES UP NO WHERE NEAR THE 
COST OF FOODS AND HEATING OIL 
BECAUSE OUR TWO MAIN OUTGOINGS 
EVERYONE THAT ONE BUYS IS 
ESCALATING SO FAST THAT WE WILL 
FIND IT DIFFICULT WITHIN THE NEXT 
YEAR OR TWO TO BUDGET OR TO COPE AS 
WE DO NOW 
THAT'S JIM 
IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT JIM AND 
MARY ARE FEELING THE SQUEEZE 
IF WE LOOK AT THE FIGURES ON THE 
VIDEO WALL BEHIND ME THE LATEST 
INFLATION FIGURES SHOW THAT 
COMPARED TO THIS TIME A YEAR AGO 
FOOD PRICES HAVE RISEN BY OVER SEVEN PER CENT 
ENERGY BILLS ARE UP BY ON AVERAGE 
EIGHT PER CENT MENT WE KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE 
PAYING BIGGER INCREASES AND FUEL 
THAT'S THE PETROL YOU PUT IN YOUR 
CAR THAT'S UP BY NEARLY ONE 
FIFTHMENT FIFTH 
LET'S TALK TO VICKY REDWOOD FROM 
CAPITAL ECONOMICS M. P. THIS IS A 
SQUEEZE ON PENSIONERS ACROSS THE 
COUNTRYMENT THEIR INCOME IS FIXED 
THE THINGS THEY SPEND THEIR MONEY 
ON IS RISING PRICE 
THAT'S RIGHT 
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MADE WORSE OFF 
FROM THE INFLATION ARE THOSE WHO 
SPEND A LOT OF THEIR INCOME ON FOOD 
AND MONEY THEY SPEND LESS ON 
CLOTHING OR ELECTRICAL GOODS 
THIS IS WHY THE OFFICIAL RATE OF 
INFLATION IS AT AROUND ABOUT THREE PER CENT 
BECAUSE IT LOOKS AT THE WHOLE 
BASKET OF GOODS AND CLOTHES AND 
ELECTRONICS ARE CHEAPER SO THAT'S 
WHY THE OFFICIAL FIGURE IS LOWER 
THAN IT FEELS LIKE IS HAPPENING IN 
OUR POCKETS 
THE THINGS WE BUY REGULARLY ARE 
PETROL AND FOOD IT IS HARDLY 
SURPRISING THAT WE FEEL WORSE OFF 
THE THINGS WE BUY LESS REGULARLY 
THEIR PRICES ARE FALLING 
WHEN YOU ECONOMISTS HANG OUT 
TOGETHER DO YOU HAVE A 
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER THE 
INFLATION RATE IS BROKEN A OT OT 
LOT LOT OF OUR VIEWERS SAYS THIS 
BEARS INTO RELATION TO THE LIFE WE 
LEAD NOW 
WE HAVE DIFFERENT 
INFLATION RATES THE OFFICIAL 
FIGURES MEASURES AVERAGE REALLY AND 
SOME WILL HAVE A LOWER INFLATION 
RATE THAN THAT BUT SOME WILL HAVE 
A HIGHER ONE IT DIFFERS PERSON TO 
PERSON SIGNIFICANTLY 
FOR PENSIONERS IN PARTICULAR IT 
SEEMS TO BE PARTICULARLY OUT OF 
KILTER KILTER WHEN MERVYN KING TALKS ABOUT 
INFLATION BEING HIGHER THAN TODAY 
AND STAYING HIGH FOR COUPLE OF 
YEARS WHAT'S THE THE IMPORTANCE OF 
THAT 
IT LIMITS THE MONETARY POLICY THAT COMMITTEE'S ROOM FOR MAN OVER 
THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE ECONOMY 
IS SLOWING HOUSE PRICES ARE 
FALLING AND UNEMPLOYMENT IS 
STARTING TO RISE THE MONETARY 
POLICY COMMITTEE WOULD BE CUTTING 
INTEREST RATES SHARPLY TO HEAD OFF 
THE RISK OF A RECESSION IT CAN'T 
DO THAT WHEN INFLATION IS THREE PER CENT AND 
RISING IT COULD BE SOME MONTHS 
BEFORE WE START TO SEE INTEREST 
RATES FALL SHARPLY 
THE ONE GLIMMER OF HOPE THAT I 
PULLED OUT OF IT WAS HIS THOUGHT 
THAT HE WOULD WAIT FOR THE PRICE 
RISES IN ENERGY AND FOOD TO WORK 
THROUGH THE SYSTEM THERE IS NO 
PANIC RISE IN INTEREST RATES ON THE 
CARDS NOW TO BRING PRICES UNDER 
CONTROL 
I THINK THAT'S RIGHT CONTROL THERE IS A SLIM CHANCE THAT WE WILL 
SEE INTEREST RATES RISE FURTHER 
BUT THEY ARE AT A HIGH LEVEL AND SO 
A LOT OF HOUSEHOLDS WILL BE 
DISAPPOINTED THAT WE ARE NOT GOING 
TO SEE INTEREST RATES FALL SHARPLY 
IN THE NEAR TERM 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US 
AS I SAID MOST OF THIS IS BASED ON 
WHAT MERVYN KING THE GOVERNOR OF 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND WAS SAYING 
YESTERDAY JUST RUNNING THROUGH THE 
KEY POINTS IF YOU MISSED THOSE 
YESTERDAY MERVYN KING TALKED ABOUT 
INFLATION PEAKING PEAKING AT 
AROUND ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT SO VERY NEARLY 
FOUR PER CENT BY THE END OF THIS YEAR AND THEN 
PRICES STAYING HIGH FOR ANOTHER 
YEAR OR SO AS WE SAY HE WAS ALSO 
FAIRLY SANGUINE ABOUT THE CAUSES OF 
THIS SANG SANGUINE IS PROBABLY NOT 
THE RIGHT WORD HE WASN'T 
SUGGESTING THAT PANIC MEASURES WERE 
NEEDED HE WAS SAYING THAT THESE 
INCREASES IN FOOD AND FUEL WOULD 
SIMPLY WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH THE 
ECONOMIC SYSTEM AND HE DIDN'T HAVE 
TO PUT INTEREST RATES UP NOW TO 
KILL OFF THAT PARTICULAR INFLATION 
REMEMBER OF COURSE HOW ALL THIS 
IS MEANT TO WORK IT IS THAT IF 
PRICES ARE RISING TOO QUICKLY IN 
THE SHOPS THE THEORY SAYS THAT THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND NEEDS TO TAKE MONEY 
OUT OF OUR POCKETS SO THAT WE DON'T 
HAVE SO MUCH SPARE CASH CHASING 
GOODS ON THE HIGH STREET AND IT 
TAKES THE MONEY OUT OF OUR POCKETS 
BY MAKING US PAY MORE FOR OUR 
BORROWING IF YOU ARE A SAVER 
HIGHER INTEREST RATES MEANS MORE 
MONEY FOR YOU 
WELL THAT'S IF YOU HAVE GOT 
SAVINGS SAVINGS FEEDING SCRAPS OF OF BREAD I HAVE 
I HAVE ALWAYS DONE IT FOR THE BIRDS 
IT IS SOMETHING MILLIONS OF US DO 
EVERY DAY LEAVING FOOD OUT FOR THE 
BIRDS BIRDS YOU MIGHT THINK LEAVING SOME CRUSTS 
OUT INTO THE GARDEN IS GOOD THING 
BUT NOT ANYMORE 
THESE ONES AREN'T REAL LIFE WHAT 
SHOULD WE BE FEEDING THE BIRDS WE 
WILL BE FINDING OUT LATER ALL WILL 
BE REVEALED AS TO WHAT IS 
UNDERNEATH THIS DISH 
JOIN US LATER AND ALL WILL BE 
SHOWN SHOWN BACK TO YOUMENT 
IT IS THE SORT OF THING YOU GET A 
ROAST TURKEY TURKEY UNDER NO IT 
DOESN'T BEAR THINKING ABOUT 
COMING UP

TO COMMIT ONE FROM TODAY THE 
BRITISH CRIME SURVEY WILL TRY TO

NIGHT TRYING TO RESTORE CALM TO 
MANCHESTER CITY CENTRE IT STARTED 
WHEN THE BIG SCREEN BATMAN BIG 
SCREEN SET UP FOR RANGERS FANS WHO 
DID NOT HAVE IT STOPPED WORKING 
IT WAS BECAUSE THAT SCREEN FAILED 
TO WORK TALK US THROUGH WHAT 
HAPPENED HAPPENED BUT IT CAUSED A LOT OF FRUSTRATION 
TAKE A LOOK AT THE SCENE BEHIND ME 
THERE IS STILL A MASSIVE CLEAN UP 
OPERATION WHAT THE MAJORITY OF 
FANS THEY WERE DRINKING CHANTING 
AND SINGING AFTER THE SCREEN BROKE 
SHORTLY BEFORE KICK OFF THERE WAS 
FRUSTRATION AND THAT WILL DRAW A 
MINORITY OF FANS THREW BOTTLES AT 
THE SCREEN AND THREW BOTTLES AT THE 
POLICE RIOT POLICE WERE CALLED 
THERE WERE SKIRMISHES AND CLASSES 
FOR AN HOUR OR TWO AFTER THE MATCH 
ONE RUSSIAN FAN WAS STABBED A MILE 
OR TWO AWAY FROM HERE AT THE CITY 
OF MANCHESTER STATION THIS CITY 
OF MANCHESTER STADIUM 
THE SEA AND THE ATMOSPHERE 
YESTERDAY WAS VERY GOOD WHAT WENT 
WRONG WHAT AT POLICE SAYING 
I THINK THEY HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE 
DIFFICULTIES CAUSED WHEN THAT BIG 
SCREEN BROKE BUT THEY ARE KEEN TO 
EMPHASISE THAT IT WAS WHAT THEY 
CALLED POCKET OF DISORDER GREATER

INVEST IN ITS FUTURE AND WHAT IT IS 
IT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HAVE TO 
SPEND IT ESTIMATES THE GAP WILL BE

OPENNESS AND HONESTY IN TERMS OF 
WHAT THE EMPLOYEE IS LOOKING FOR 
AND WHAT THE BUSINESS CAN MAKE WORK 
AND AGREEING MUTUALLY BETWEEN US 
HOW TO MAKE THAT WORK SUCCESSFULLY 
DOES YOUR HEART SINK WHEN ONE OF 
YOUR EMPLOYEES COMES TO YOU AND 
ASKED TO WORK FEWER HOURS TO WORK 
FROM HOME BECAUSE YOU THINK IT IS 
A HEADACHE FOR YOU 
KNOW IT DOES NOT MAKE MY HEART SINK 
I WOULD MUCH PREFER THAT THAT 
SOMEBODY COMING TO ME AND TELLING 
ME THEY CANNOT MAKE THIS WORK AND 
GIVING ME THE RESIGNATION L. GET 
HAPPY WORKERS HAPPY WORKERS ARE 
MORE PRODUCTIVE WORKERS WE DO A 
MUCH BETTER JOB 
I HAVE JUST HAD ONE OF MY PEOPLE GO 
DOWN FROM FOUR DAYS A WEEK TO TWO 
DAYS WEEK I KNEW AND NEEDED TO 
KEEPER NOW I HAVE THAT TO FIND 
SOMEBODY FOR THE OTHER TWO DAYS A 
WEEK SHE CAME FOR FOUR DAYS A WEEK 
NOW I HAVE GOT A DENTED TOO IT 
MAKES LIFE VERY DIFFICULT I WOULD 
LOVE IT IF THEY ALL CAME IN AT NINE A M. 
ON MONDAY MORNING AND WENT HOME AT 
FIVE P. M. ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON 
I DO NOT THINK THAT IS REALISTIC 
THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS THERE WILL BE A 
SHRINKING POPULATION OF PEOPLE 
WORKING IF WE SAY THERE ARE 
BARRIERS AND ALLOWING PEOPLE TO 
WORK FLEXIBLY AND PART TIME WHERE 
WE GOING TO GIVE WORKERS KEEP WERE 
WHO REALLY BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR 
PARENTING SKILLS 
WE ARE ALREADY BEING HELD 
RESPONSIBLE FOR PARENTING SKILLS 
EVERYBODY WORKS FROM HOME THEY 
WILL NOT HAVE TO WALK CAN MEET TO 
WORK AND THEREFORE WILL SAVE THE 
ENVIRONMENT WHAT ELSE WILL 
EMPLOYERS HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR Q. I 
RUN DESIGN 
CONSULTANCY RUN A CELEBRITY MANAGEMENT CONSULTANCY I NEED TO BE THERE ALL 
THE TIME I HAVE HAD PEOPLE 
APPLYING FOR JOBS TO HAVE SAID I 
WOULD ONLY WANT TO MIDOMICOM OR AS 
AN WEDNESDAY AND FOR HER AT AND 
THURSDAY IT IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO A 
SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS 
IF SOMEBODY IS WORKING PART TIME 
ONE DAY AND THEY RING IN THE NEXT 
DAY THEY ARE NOT THERE 
IF YOU 
HAVE GOOD COMMUNICATION AND GOOD 
HANDOVER BETWEEN SOMEBODY THAT IS 
GOING TO HANDLE THINGS WHEN YOU ARE 
NOT THERE THE EXPERIENCE OUR 
CLIENTS HAVE IS CONTINUOUS AND 
SEAMLESS SEAMLESS YOU EMPLOY PEOPLE ONLY ON THE BASIS 
THAT THEY ALL SOWN THE SAME 
SOUND THE SAME 
NOT AT ALL THEY 
ARE ALL DOING A GREAT JOB CLIENTS 
ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THAT AS LONG 
AS THEY DELIVER WHAT YOU ASKED THEM 
TO DELIVER 
SIAN I HAVE A LOT OF EXAMS TAKING 
PLACE IN OUR FAMILY SO NEXT WEEK I 
WILL BE STARTING AT EIGHT HUNDRED A M. 
YOU HAVE GOT LOT OF EXAMS I HAVE 
S. A. T.'S AND GCSES 
WE WILL DO FLEXY WORKING AND WE 
WILL WORK FROM HOME AND PHONE THEM

JIMMY MIZEN

LAST NIGHT

STUPID 
YOU'RE STUPID AND THE GROOM IS STUPID STUPID IT IS GOING TO BE WET AND WE HAVE 
RAIN SPREADING UP FROM THE SOUTH 
COAST AND IT IS HEADING NORTH AND 
AND SOME OF IT HAS BEEN HEAVY AND 
SOME OF IT IS THUNDERY THE OTHER 
THING YOU WILL NOTICE IF YOU ARE 
STEPPING OUT IT IS COOLER THAN IT 
HAS BEENMENT FOR SOME COMPARED TO 
LAST WEEKEND WE ARE LOOKING AT TEN 
DEGREE DROP IN TEMPERATURES 
THE RAIN GATHERED IN THE SOUTH WEST 
DURING LAST NIGHT WE HAD FINE 
ARRAY OF THUNDERSTORM AND THIS 
MORNING WE HAVE HAD THUNDERSTORMS 
NOT NOT FAR FROM LONDON BY NINE A M. WE 
WILL HAVE MORE RAIN PUSHING 
NORTHWARDS ACROSS THE SOUTH EASTERN 
CORNER NOT PARTICULARLY HEAVY AND 
PATCHY IN PLACES BUT FOR PARTS OF 
OF EAST ANGLIA AND A LOT OF THE 
NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND IT IS FINE 
START IN BETWEEN THE SUNSHINE WE 
HAVE GOT REAL LINE OF CLOUD 
EXTENDING UP THE PENNINES FOR 
CENTRAL AND EASTERN SCOTLAND PARTS 
OF WESTERN SCOTLAND TOO BUT THE 
CLOUD WILL BREAK AND WE WILL SEE 
SUNSHINE WHEN THE MIST CLEARS FROM 
NORTHERN IRELAND A BEAUTIFUL START 
TO THE DAY AS IT IS ACROSS THE 
NORTH WEST OF WALES ACROSS WALES 
AND INTO THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND 
AND WE'RE BACK INTO THE CLOUD AND 
ALSO THE RAIN 
THE THE RAIN BAND WILL MIGRATE 
STEADILY NORTHWARDS THROUGH THE 
DAYMENT IT WILL BE HEAVY AT TIMES 
ACROSS THE SOUTH OF WALES AND 
BEHIND IT THERE WILL BE A LOT OF 
CLOUD BUT THE CLOUD WILL BREAK WE 
WILL SEE SUNSHINE AND THE 
TEMPERATURES WILL RISE AND WE COULD 
CATCH SOME SHOWERS AT BEST IN THE 
SUNSHINE TODAY WE ARE LOOKING AT 
HIGH OF EIGHTEEN CELSIUS THAT RAIN WILL 
BE WITH US AS WE GO THROUGH THE 
NIGHT AGAIN THROUGH WALES THE 
MIDLANDS AND EAST ANGLIA AND THAT'S 
HOW IT WILL BE WHEN WE START THE 
DAY TOMORROW 
WHERE IT WILL BE RATHER 
A LOT OF CLOUD AROUND THE BEST 
BREAKS TOMORROW IN THE NORTH WEST 
OF THE COUNTRY AND TEMPERATURES ON 
A PAR WITH TODAY 
FOR SATURDAY MORE RAIN SWEEPING 
INTO THE SOUTH WEST SHOWERY AND 
AGAIN LOT OF CLOUD THE BEST 
BREAKS IN THE NORTH AND FOR THE 
NEXT FEW DAYS WE WILL CONTINUE WITH 
A STIFF NORTH EASTERLY BREEZE SO IT 
WILL FEEL CHILLY THAT'S IT 
DECLAN DECLAN SUMMER SUMMER CAME AND WENT 
IF YOU CAST YOUR MIND WHEN THE 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE TOOK OVER IT WAS 
TRYING TO WORK OUT WHAT IT WAS MANY 
TO BE WAS IT BUSINESS THAT WAS 
ABOUT PHONE CALLS WHICH WAS SEEN AS 
A DYING TRADE OR WAS IT GOING TO 
MOVE INTO BROADBAND 
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE IS STEPPING 
DOWN AND HE GOES AT THE END OF THE 
MONTH MONTH YOU ARE NOT PACKING UP IN BUSINESS 
ALTOGETHER YOU ARE GOING TO GO OFF 
AND DO A PROPER JOB 
I HOPE SO BUT 
AT SOME POINT IT IS GOOD TO 
HANDOVER HANDOVER B. T. IS IN GREAT SHAPE SO IT IS THE HANDOVER 
RIGHT TIME TO DO THAT 
WE HAVE 
SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT 
HOW B. T. CHARGED WHILE YOU HAVE BEEN 
IN CHARGE HOW WOULD YOU SUM UP 
YOUR SIX YEARS 
BROPBD BROADBAND IS 
NOW ALL OVER IF YOU LOOK TO THE 
BUSINESS IT WAS NOT THE GLOBAL 
BUSINESS TODAY IT IS A REALLY 
GLOBAL BUSINESS AND IF YOU ARE A 
SHAREHOLDER YOU GET TWO PEN 
DIVIDEND SIX YEARS AGO THIS YEAR 
YOU WILL GET ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT SO IT IS SEVEN 
OR EIGHT TIMES MORE 
MORE MONEY FOR SHAREHOLDERS 
YES YES YOU SAY A BETTER EXPERIENCE FOR 
CUSTOMERS AND THAT BIG MOVE INTO 
BROADBAND AND THAT'S PROBABLY THE 
THING THAT YOU WILL BE REMEMBERED 
FOR MOST 
WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
PEOPLE WILL REMEMBER BUT I KNOW 
THAT TODAY IF YOU LOOK TO 
BROADBAND IT IS THE WAY OF LIFE 
IT IS WHAT PEOPLE WANT IT IS WHAT 
THEY EXPERIENCE NEW WAYS OF 
COMMUNICATIONS NEW WAYS OF DOING 
BUSINESS NEW WAYS OF INTERACTING 
WITH THEIR FAMILY 
EVERY TIME YOU 
APPEAR SOME VIEWERS GET IN TOUCH 
AND SAY IT IS ALL VERY WELL BEN 
SAYING THESE GREAT THINGS ABOUT 
BROADBAND BUT B. T. DRAGS ITS FEET 
AND IS SLOW IN MAKING CONNECTIONS 
IT IS NOT HAPPY ABOUT RUNNING THE 
STRUCK INFRA TURE SO OTHER 
COMPANIES COMPANIES CAN OFFER THE 
BROADBAND SERVICE TRUE OR FALSE 
WE RUN THE BUSINESS FOR OUR 
CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS BUT OUR 
CUSTOMERS ARE VITAL IF OUR 
CUSTOMERS HAVE COMPLAINTS WE ALWAYS 
TRY AND IMPROVE IT IF YOU SEE WHAT 
THEY HAVE GOT FOR THEIR MONEYMENT 
TWO YEARS AGO YOU PAID FIFTEEN AND NOW 
YOU PAY FIVE AND THE CHOICE IS 
TREMENDOUS 
YOUR DECISION TO STEP TREMENDOUS DOWN AND LET THE NEW GUY TAKE OVER 
IT IS REMARKABLE IN BUSINESS MOST 
BUSINESS CAREERS END IN RETIREMENT 
OR THEY END IN FAILURE BECAUSE 
PEOPLE ARE DRIVEN OUT BECAUSE 
SHAREHOLDERS ARE FED UP AND WANT 
THEM TO GO YOU DECIDED IT IS TIME 
FOR A CHANGE 
I BELIEVE THAT 
LEADERSHIP HAS A SHELF LIFETIME 
YOU NEED TO STAY FRESH AND STAY 
FOCUSED ON IMPROVEMENTS ALL OVER 
AND IF YOU HAD YOUR RUN IT IS 
BETTER TO CALL IT A DAY AND SAY 
THERE IS A NEW NEW GUY COMING IT 
IS A A GREAT GREAT TEAM 
ANY THING 
YOU REGRET 
TALKING TO MANY PEOPLE 
TOO LONG 
THANK YOU

OF GOALS TURNING TO CRIME OFFENCES 
ARE UP TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OVER THE LAST THREE 
YEARS GIRLS 
WELCOME TO THE PROGRAMME A NINETEEN 
YEAR OLD MAN IS CHARGED WITH THE 
MURDER OF TEENAGER AT JIMMY MIZEN 
VIOLENT CLASHES BETWEEN RANGERS 
FANS AND RIOT POLICE AFTER THE 
TEAM'S DEFEAT IN THE UEFA CUP FINAL 
IN MANCHESTER MORE THAN PEOPLE 
ARE ARRESTED MORE FLEXIBLE WORKING 
HOURS FOR PARENTS BUT IS IT FAIR 
ON COLLEAGUES WHO DON'T HAVE 
CHILDREN FEEDING BIRDS IS GOOD 
BEATING THEM BREAD IS BAD WHAT 
SHOULD WE FEED THEM FIND OUT LATER 
SHE IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST 
SUCCESSFUL SINGER SONGWRITERS 
SHERYL CROW WILL BE HERE ON THE 
SOFA TO TALK ABOUT HER NEW RECORD 
AND UPCOMING CONCERT IN HYDE PARK 
YOU CAN GO THROUGH TO THE BOARDROOM 
NOW 
BUT WHICH ONE IS IT GOING TO NOW BE IT'S GOODBYE TO ANOTHER WOULD 
BE APPRENTICE SIR ALLEN'S LATEST 
VICTIM WILL BE ON THE SOFA AFTER 
NINE A M. THE NUMBER OF CRIMES COMMITTED 
BY GIRLS IN ENGLAND AND WALES HAS 
INCREASED BY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OVER THE PAST 
THREE YEARS THE FIGURES RELEASED 
BY THE YOUTH JUSTICE BOARD REFER 
TO CRIMES COMMITTED BY GIRLS AGED 
BETWEEN TEN AND SEVENTEEN LEADING TO A 
POLICE WARNING OR COURT ACTION 
OVER THE SAME PERIOD THE NUMBER OF 
CRIMES COMMITTED BY BOYS HAS FALLEN 
SLIGHTLY IT'S NO LONGER JUST YOUNG 
MEN WHO ARE BEHAVING BADLY TODAY 
CONFIRMATION FROM THE BODY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR REDUCING YOUTH 
OFFENDING THAT GROWING NUMBERS OF 
GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN ARE BREAKING 
THE LAW TOO THE LATEST FIGURES ON 
YOUTH CRIME SHOW THAT WHILE 
OFFENDING BY VOICES DOWN TWO PER CENT ON 
THREE YEARS AGO OFFENCES COMMITTED 
BY GIRLS IN THE SAME PERIOD IS UP 
TWENTY FIVE PER CENT LAST YEAR THAT MEANT FIFTY NINE THOUSAND 
OFFENCES BY GIRLS ONE OF THEM WAS 
LEANDER SHE HAS TURNED HER LIFE 
AROUND AFTER BEING PUT ON A YOUTH 
OFFENDING SCHEME FOR ASSAULT AND 
ANOTHER GIRL WHEN SHE WAS FIFTEEN IT IT HAD BEEN MY FIRST OFFENCE I'D 
NEVER BEEN IN TROUBLE WITH THE 
POLICE BEFORE I'M NOT BROUGHT UP 
TO BE AROUND CRIME L. FELT 
DEVASTATED THE MOST THEN I HAD A 
MY MIND WAS MY MUM L. KNEW SHE 
DIDN'T BRING HER CHILDREN UP TO BE 
LIKE THAT L. WAS MORE DISAPPOINTED 
AT MYSELF ANYTHING ELSE 
SOME OF 
THE BIGGEST INCREASES IN TODAY'S 
FIGURES INVOLVED PUBLIC ORDER 
OFFENCES AND VIOLENCE OFTEN 
CARRIED OUT BY GIRLS WHO WERE DRUNK 
AND THIS COMMUNITY POLICE OFFICER 
IN ESSEX SAID THERE ARE OTHER 
PROBLEMS SUCH AS SHOPLIFTING IN IN THE PAST WE HAVEN'T SEEN GIRLS BEEN 
SIGNIFICANTLY INVOLVED IN CRIME 
HOWEVER RECENTLY WE HAVE AND A 
STEALING THINGS LIKE COSMETICS AND 
MAKE UP WHICH ARE VERY EASY THINGS 
TO STEAL THE ONUS IS ON THE SHOPS 
TO STOCK THAT BEEN GOING ON IT 
SEEMS A TERRIBLE WASTE A YOUNG 
PEOPLE TO ENTER THE CRIMINAL 
JUSTICE SYSTEM GET A CRIMINAL 
RECORD FOR STEALING THINGS LIKE 
THAT 
YOUNG PEOPLE OF EITHER SEX THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE A VICTIM OF 
CRIME THAN TO COMMIT ONE FROM 
TODAY THE BRITISH CRIME SURVEY 
WILL TRY TO GET A CLEARER PICTURE 
BY EXPANDING TO INCLUDE THE UNDER 
SIXTEENS EXPERIENCE OF CRIME OUR 
HOME EDITOR IS HERE TO TELL US MORE 
ABOUT IT GIRLS WILL BE GIRLS 
EXCEPT A BIT MORE LIKE BOYS THESE 
DAYS 
THERE IS AN ISSUE ABOUT THE DAYS USE OF ALCOHOL PARTICULARLY BY 
YOUNG WOMEN L. DON'T THINK THE 
AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL DRUNK TODAY 
ITS FAR GREATER THAN IT WAS PERHAPS 
FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEARS AGO BUT WE HAVE TO 
BE CAREFUL WITH THESE STATISTICS 
WHAT THEY REPRESENT IS NOT 
NECESSARILY MORE CRIME ALTHOUGH I 
THINK THEY PROBABLY DO TO A DEGREE 
BUT MORE POLICE ACTIVITY TO DEAL 
WITH THAT CRIME WE SAW THAT POLICE 
OFFICER IN THAT REPORT SAYING IT 
SEEMS SUCH A SHAME THAT A YOUNG 
GIRL SHOULD GET A CRIMINAL RECORD 
FOR STEALING SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS 
A BIT OF MAKE UP FROM A SHOP 
PERHAPS FIVE YEARS AGO THEY 
WOULDN'T HAVE DONE PERHAPS FIVE 
YEARS AGO THEY WOULD HAVE JUST GOT 
A WARNING OF SOME KIND THAT DIDN'T 
ACTUALLY MEAN THEY HAD A CRIMINAL 
RECORD THAT WAS RECORDED AS PART 
OF THE RECORDED CRIME STATISTICS L. 
THINK THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE IN 
TERMS OF THE VIOLENCE FIGURES 
WHICH ARE STARTLING A FIFTEEN PER CENT 
INCREASE OVER THREE YEARS BUT WHAT 
WE ARE SEEING IS THE POLICE WHO 
NOW HAVE A TARGET TO GET MORE 
OFFENCES TO COURT ACTUALLY SAYING 
RIGHT ONE GIRL HAS PULLED THE HAIR 
OF ANOTHER THAT'S AN ASSAULT HOW HOW DO THE GIRLS RATE AGAINST THE BOYS 
IN TERMS OF 
ONE TO FOUR IN TERMS OF THE 
AMOUNT OF CRIME THEY ARE NOT IN 
THE SAME LEAGUE YOU'RE TALKING 
ABOUT THEM BECOMING MORE LIKE BOYS 
THEY'VE GOT A FAIR WAY TO GO 
BECAUSE BEFORE THEY COMMIT THE 
SAME LEVEL OF CRIME AS BOYS L. 
THINK WE SHOULD BE POSITIVE ABOUT 
THESE FIGURES TODAY IN ONE SENSE 
WE'RE SEEING A PICTURE OF STABILITY 
HERE IN TERMS OF RECORDED OFFENCES 
BY THE POLICE DESPITE THE FACT 
THAT THERE THEY ARE BEING ASKED 
TO BRING MORE OFFENCES DO JUSTICE 
A PRETTY STABLE PICTURE AND OTHER 
EVIDENCE AND IT'S HARD TO GET A 
HANDLE ON THIS BUT ONE OF THE 
THINGS THE CRIMINAL OFFICE DOES IS 
ASKED PEOPLE ON A REGULAR BASIS 
ABOUT THE CRIMES THAT THEY'VE 
COMMITTED OVER TIME YOU CAN ASK 
PEOPLE ABOUT THE CRIMES THEY HAVE 
COMMITTED AND FIND OUT IF IT IS 
GOING UP OR DOWN THAT ALSO SHOWS 
THE POSITION OF STABILITY THEY 
HAVE BEEN SOME GHASTLY CRIMES 
INVOLVING YOUNG PEOPLE WHICH MAKE 
THE HEADLINES AND A REGULAR BASIS 
BUT THEY ARE REALLY QUITE A FEW 
OVERALL THE STORY IS YOUTH CRIME 
REMAINING PRETTY FLAT 
A MAN HAS 
BEEN CHARGED WITH THE MURDER OF 
JIMMY MIZEN THAT'S THE TEENAGER 
WHO WAS STABBED TO DEATH AT LEE IN 
SOUTH LONDON THE DAY AFTER HIS SIXTEENTH

SWEET YOUNG MAN WHEN JAKE FAHRI 
DOES THE RIGHT HERE THE DEFENDANT

BEEN CHARGED WITH THE MURDER OF 
STEPHEN BIGLEY IN LONDON'S OXFORD 
STREET ANTHONY COSTA IS ACCUSED OF 
STABBING THE TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD OUTSIDE A 
RESTAURANT HE WILL APPEAR IN COURT 
LATER TODAY RIOT POLICE HAVE SPENT 
MOST OF THE NIGHT TRYING TO RESTORE 
CALM TO MANCHESTER CITY CENTRE 
THAT'S FOLLOWING TROUBLE AT THE 
UEFA CUP FINAL LAST NIGHT THAT 
TROUBLE STARTED WHEN A BIG SCREEN 
WHICH WAS SET UP FOR THE RANGERS 
FANS WHO DIDN'T HAVE TICKETS BROKE 
JUST BEFORE KICK OFF WHEN THE BIG 
SCREEN BROKE THE FRUSTRATION WAS 
PERHAPS UNDERSTANDABLE BUT IT SOON 
BOILED OVER AMONG THE MINORITY WHO 
CLASHED WITH POLICE UGLY SCENES ON 
ONE OF THE BIG NIGHTS OF EUROPEAN 
FOOTBALL THERE WERE INJURIES AND 
ARRESTS WHAT POLICE DESCRIBE AS A 
SICKENING ACT TO A SPORTING BALL 
FROM WHAT I SAW AND THERE ARE 
ALWAYS TWO SIDES TO EVERY STORY 
BUT I SAW MY OFFICERS BEHAVED WELL 
THEY RESPONDED WITH RESTRAINT AND 
IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO THE LEVEL OF 
VIOLENCE THEY HAVE RECEIVED L. HAVE 
SEEN SOME QUITE DISTURBING FOOTAGE 
TONIGHT WHICH WE WILL BE 
INVESTIGATING AT THIS STAGE I 
REALLY DO NOT BELIEVE THERE WAS ANY 
HEAVY HANDED POLICING 
THERE WERE 
FEW REPORTED INCIDENCE BETWEEN 
RIVAL SUPPORTERS ALTHOUGH ONE 
RUSSIAN FAN WAS STABBED NEAR TO THE 
STADIUM HE IS NOT THOUGHT TO HAVE 
BEEN STICK SERIOUSLY INJURED THE 
AMOUNT OF LITTER AND BROKEN GLASS 
MEAN THAT PARTS OF THE CITY CENTRE 
ARE LITERALLY CRUNCHING UNDERFOOT 
THE CLEAN UP OPERATION HAS ALREADY 
BEEN UNDER WAY FOR A FEW HOURS BUT 
IS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME YET 
LET'S TALK TO SIR RICHARD LEASE HE 
IS LEADER OF MANCHESTER CITY 
COUNCIL THANK YOU FOR JOINING US 
HORRIBLE MESS BEHIND YOU THAT IS 
THE LEAST OF YOUR PROBLEMS ISN'T 
IT BEARING IN MIND WHAT WENT ON 
LAST NIGHT WE'RE HEARING IT WAS 
ALL DOWN TO THE BIG SCREEN WHAT 
WENT WRONG 
RUBBISH WE CAN CLEAN UP 
WE HAD AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND RANGERS 
SUPPORTERS IN THE CITY LAST NIGHT 
IT'S UNPRECEDENTED IT'S THE 
BIGGEST MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE FOR AN 
EVENT OF THIS OR THAT EVER TAKEN 
PLACE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE 
WERE REASONABLY WELL BEHAVED WE 
HAD NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER WHEN 
THE BIG SCREEN WENT DOWN WE DID 
HAVE CONTINGENCY PLANS WE PUT 
ANOTHER SCREEN UP SOME DISTANCE 
AWAY THE BUST PEOPLE TO IT AND THE 
VAST MAJORITY OF FANS WENT ABOUT 
ALTERNATIVE SCREEN A SMALL NUMBER 
OF FANS DIDN'T THEY STAYED IN THE 
CITY CENTRE STARTED THROWING 
BOTTLES AT THE POLICE THAT'S WHEN 
IT ALL KICKED OFF 
DO YOU THINK 
THERE WAS SOME PROBLEM PERHAPS IN 
THE PLANNING MANCHESTER BID TO 
HAVE THE GAME HELD THEIR THEY 
INVITED THE FANS DOWN MORE THAN 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ARRIVED WANTING TO SEE THE 
GAME AT SOMEWHERE WAS THE CITY UP 
TO IT IN THE END 
IT WAS AN 
UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER WHEN THE 
SCREEN WENT DOWN WE DID PUT ANOTHER 
SCREEN UP IMMEDIATELY WE HAD BUSES 
THAT WOULD GET PEOPLE TO THAT 
SCREEN WE HAD PLANNED ALL 
CONTINGENCIES I THINK IT WOULD BE 
A REAL MISTAKE IF WHAT WERE A SMALL 
MINORITY OF RANGERS FANS TO SAY 
THAT THEIR BEHAVIOUR COULD BE 
EXCUSED BY A TECHNICAL PROBLEM WITH 
A SCREEN MOST OF THE FANS IN THE 
PICCADILLY GARDENS AREA WHEN 
THAT'S GREEN WENT DOWN THEY DID NOT 
CAUSE ANY PROBLEMS A VERY SMALL 
MINORITY DID IF WE ARE GOING TO 
PUT A FINGER OF BLAME ANY WHERE IT 
HAS TO BE WITH THOSE FANS TAKING 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN 
BEHAVIOUR 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WRITING BEHAVIOUR IN TO US TODAY RANGERS FANS 
SAYING THEY ARE DISGUSTED WITH WHAT 
HAPPENED TO THE SPORT WITH THE 
SMALL MINORITY OF FANS CAN I ASK 
ABOUT THE MESS IT IS SOMETHING 
THAT CAN BE CLEARED UP BUT HOW LONG 
AS IT GOING TO TAKE BEFORE 
MANCHESTER GETS BACK TO NORMAL 
MANCHESTER IS GETTING BACK TO 
NORMAL IF YOU WERE TO TURN THE 
CAMERA ROUND THE OTHER WAY YOU 
WOULD SEE PEOPLE GOING TO WORK 
JUST AS THEY WOULD DO EVERY OTHER 
DAY WE CAN CLEAR THE RUBBISH UP 
THIS HAS BEEN BAD FOR THE 
REPUTATION OF GLASGOW AND 
MANCHESTER BOTH CITIES IT WILL 
TAKE A LITTLE LONGER TO RESTORE THE 
REPUTATION IS THAT WE HAVE 
PREVIOUSLY 
THE CHINESE ARMY HAS INCREASED ITS 
RESCUE EFFORTS IN THE AREA AFFECTED 
BY THE EARTHQUAKE IT'S BELIEVED 
FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE LIKE DEAD OR BURIED 
ALIVE UNDER THE RUBBLE NINETEEN BRITISH 
TOURISTS WHO WERE VISITING THE 
REGION IN CHINA WHERE THE 
EARTHQUAKE STRUCK HAVE BEEN FOUND 
SAFE THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR SAVE 
THEY WERE IN THE WOLONG AREA 
FAMOUS FOR ITS PANDA RESERVE THIS 
IS A MASSIVE OPERATION BY THE 
CHINESE AUTHORITIES BECAUSE TEN 
MILLION PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED 
EXACTLY THAT THE FIRST AND THE 
CHINESE HAVE PUT NUMBER ON IT 
THEY SAID TEN MILLION OUT OF 
POPULATION OF TWENTY MILLION THE 
PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY IS CO 
ORDINATING THE RESCUE EFFORTS 
THEY'RE ONE OF THE BIGGEST ARMIES 
AND THE WORLD EVEN FOR THEM THIS 
DISASTER SEEMS TO BE TOO MUCH TO 
HANDLE IT'S STRETCHING THEIR 
RESOURCES VERY THINLY THIS MORNING 
THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES PUT OUT 
PLEA TO THE PUBLIC ASKING THEM FOR

WE HAVE THE APPRENTICE COMING IN 
AND WE HAVE SHERYL CROW 
SINCE THE DISEASE VARIANT C. J. D. THE 
HUMAN FORM OF MAD COW DISEASE 
EMERGED IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES THERE HAVE 
BEEN ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX CASES IN THE U. K. LAST YEAR 
FIVE PEOPLE DIED ONE OF THEM WAS 
CHRISTINE LORD'S SON ANDREW 
CHRISTINE HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR 
ANSWERS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER 
SON AND WHY CHRISTINE RECORDED 
ANDREW'S LAST MONEYS IN A VIDEO 
DIARY WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO HER 
IN A MOMENT BECAUSE SHE'S JOINED US 
IN THE STUDIO HELLO FIRST WE 
WILL HAVE A LOOK AT THAT VIDEO 
DIARY DIARY IT IS HIS BIRTHDAY TODAY LAST 
NIGHT WE WENT OUT WITH HIS FRIENDS 
WE WENT TO THE FUNFAIR AND I STOOD 
WITH ANDREW WHILE THEY GOT ON THE 
WALTZERS AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS 
THAT YOUNG PEOPLE DO WONDERED 
WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH HIS HEAD 
BECAUSE ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE 
JUMPING AROUND IN AND OUT DANCING 
AROUND AND HE WAS LAUGHING WITH 
THEM 
THERE WAS A SENSE OF BEWILDERMENT 
ON HIS FACE AT THE TIME WE BROUGHT 
HIM HOME IN THE CAR HE STARTED 
TREMBLING TREMBLING CHRISTINE THE SHOCK IS YOU HAVE 
BROUGHT A PICTURE IN OF ANDY YES YES WE WILL SHOW IT TO THE CAMERA IT 
HAPPENED SO QUICKLY 
YES AND ALSO 
HIS DEATH WAS SO AVOIDABLE BECAUSE 
ONE OF THE REASONS I HAVE DONE THE 
CAMPAIGN AS WELL AS THE DOCUMENTARY 
IS THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT I'M 
EXPOSING AT THE MOMENT KNEW THAT 
B. S. E. HAD SEVERE IMPLICATIONS FOR 
HUMAN HEALTH AT THE EARLIEST 
STAGES I CONSIDER THEM HOLDING THE 
SMOKING GUN THAT KILLED MY SON 
MY SON'S DEATH WAS TOTALLY 
AVOIDABLE I SEE THE VIDEO THAT I 
TOOK THROUGHOUT HIS LAST DAYS AND 
AS A JOURNALIST THERE'S A BIG STORY 
HERE BUT AS HIS MOTHER IT BREAKS 
MY HEART THIS IS SO DIFFICULT FOR 
ME TO BE SITTING HERE WITH YOU 
BECAUSE I'M TALKING NOT ABOUT A 
STORY I'M TALKING ABOUT MY SON MY 
SON WAS NOT A STATISTIC L. FEEL 
THAT THE HUMAN FORM OF MAD COW 
DISEASE HAS BEEN FORGOTTEN REALLY 
PEOPLE THINK IT'S GONE AWAY IT 
HASN'T 
IT WAS IN MARCH OF LAST HASN'T YEAR THAT ANDREW CONTRACTED IT YES YES AT TIME WHEN MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT 
THE RISK WAS GONE 
I KNOW THERE ARE 
A COUPLE OF PEOPLE IN THEIR EARLY 
TWENTIES THAT HAVE CONTRACTED IT NOW AS 
WELL ONE IN ONE THOUSAND OF US ARE 
PROBABLY CARRYING IT TOO L. HAVE 
TALKED TO THE EXPERTS THIS IS A 
HUGE STORY AND THIS IS A HUGE 
GOVERNMENT COVER UP BASICALLY THIS 
IS WHAT THE CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT L. 
PROFILE PEOPLE ON THE WEBSITE THAT 
I HOLD PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR MY 
SON'S DEATH L. CAN'T LET THIS GO 
IN HIS LAST MONTHS HE TURNED AROUND 
TO ME AND SAID MUM FIND OUT WHO 
DID THIS TO ME EXPOSE THOSE PEOPLE 
THIS MUST NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN MY 
SON WAS VERY ARTICULATE HE WORKED 
FOR THE B. B. C. HE HAD THE WORLD AT 
HIS FEET HE WAS A TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD FIT 
HEALTHY YOUNG MAN YET HE HAD BEEN 
INCUBATING THIS DISEASE FOR FIFTEEN 
YEARS SOMETHING THAT HE HAD 
INGESTED OR EATEN THAT LONG AGO 
THAT IS THE PROBLEM ISN'T IT YES YES IT IS A VERY FAST DEATH HE DIED IN 
DECEMBER HE WAS INCUBATING THE 
DISEASE FOR SO LONG HE DIDN'T KNOW 
ABOUT IT FROM YOUR RESEARCH AND 
THERE IS VERY MOVING MOMENT WHERE 
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE THE FACT 
THAT YOU SIT BY HIS BEDSIDE READING 
AND READING ALL THE RESEARCH YOU 
CAN HOW MANY PEOPLE DO WE KNOW 
COULD BE INCUBATING THIS 
I TALKED 
TO ONE OF THE WORLD EXPERTS HE 
RECKONS ONE IN A THOUSAND OF US ARE 
INCUBATING IT 
HOW DO WE FIND OUT 
THAT IS A VERY LOW FIGURE YOU 
CAN'T IT IS TIMEBOMB L. DIDN'T 
KNOW MY SON WAS INCUBATING IT FOR 
YEARS HE WAS HEALTHY AND WITHIN SIX 
MONTHS THE SYMPTOMS STARTED TO 
DEVELOP AND HE IS DEAD MY SON IS 
SIX FEET DOWN IN GRAVE AND THERE 
ARE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS 
THERE ARE GUILTY MEN AND WOMEN OUT 
THERE THEY HOLD THE SMOKING GUN 
THEY KILLED MY SON MY SON'S DEATH 
WAS TOTALLY AVOIDABLE L. L. HAVE SEEN 
MEMOS BACK TO NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE WHERE 
INFORMATION HAS BEEN SAT ON BECAUSE 
IT HAS SEVERE IMPLICATIONS FOR 
HUMAN HEALTH BUT IT ALSO HAS 
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MEAT TRADE 
THAT WAS SHARED AT THE HIGHEST 
LEVELS THAT IS WHAT I'M GATHERING 
I'M GATHERING PROOF AND EVIDENCE 
AND THE WEBSITE PEOPLE HAVE COME 
FORWARD WITHIN TWENTY HOURS OF THE 
WEBSITE BEING LAUNCHED AFTER THE 
DOCUMENTARY WAS SHOWN IN THE SOUTH 
AND I'M HOPING IT IS GOING TO BE 
SHOWN NATIONWIDE 
IT WAS ON 
INSIDE OUT IN THE SOUTH 
YES WE 
HAVE HAD FOUR PEOPLE THAT HAVE 
LOGGED ON L. HAVE HUNDREDS OF 
PEOPLE COME FORWARD WITH INSIDE 
INFORMATION AGRICULTURAL WORKERS 
INDUSTRIAL SCIENTISTS PEOPLE THAT 
PREPARED THE FEED FOR THE CATTLE 
AND EVEN JOURNALISTS JOURNALISTS 
NEVER SHARE STORIES WITH OTHER 
JOURNALISTS BUT EVEN JOURNALISTS 
HAVE COME FORWARD SO MY MAIN 
THRUST NOW IS TO FIND OUT I KNOW 
WHO KILLED MY SON MY MAIN THRUST 
IS TO MAKE THESE PUBLICLY AND 
LEGALLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR MY DEAR 
BOY'S AVOIDABLE DEATH 
I KNOW YOU 
ARE FOCUSING A LOT ON THE CAMPAIGN 
THERE MUST BE AN IMAGE OF HIM THAT 
YOU HOLD ON TO 
HE WAS THE MOST 
GENTLEST MAN ANYBODY WHO WORKED 
WITH HIM WOULD SAY HE WAS AN 
HONOURABLE MEN THESE ARE NOT 
HONOURABLE MEN AND WOMEN AND NOBODY 
HAS BEEN ACCOUNTABLE FOR IT THANK

TEMPERATURE ACROSS THE EAST OF THE 
COUNTRY WE HAVE VARIABLE AMOUNTS 
OF CLOUD SOME BREAKS IN THE CLOUD 
TO THE SOUTH WE HAVE GOT THE RAIN 
YOU CAN SEE HOW THE RAIN IS GOING 
TO CONTINUE TO PUSH NORTHWARDS AS 
WE GO THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE DAY 
BEHIND IT A LOT OF CLOUD SOME 
BREAKS AND THAT IN ITSELF WILL 
SPARK OFF SOME SHOWERS AS 
TEMPERATURES RISE THE BEST 
SUNSHINE TODAY THE NORTH WEST OF 
SCOTLAND THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND 
AND ALSO NORTHERN IRELAND TONIGHT 
THE RAIN WILL BE WIGGLING AROUND 
WALES THE MIDLANDS AND THE SOUTH 
EASTERN CORNER TOMORROW QUITE A 
CLOUDY DAY WITH SOME BREAKS AGAIN 
IN THE NORTH WEST THEN ON SUNDAY 
AND SATURDAY WE ARE LOOKING AT 
RAIN CLEARING FROM THE SOUTH WEST 
A LOT OF CLOUD AND A BRISK NORTH 
EASTERLY WIND THAT IS IT BACK TO 
YOU TWO 
YOU TWO 
YOU TWO NOW HOW DID A BOTTLE OF KETCHUP 
AND A COFFEE JAR LAND A PENSIONER 
IN SO MUCH TROUBLE THAT HIS COUNCIL 
REFUSED TO COLLECT HIS BIN LENNY 
NINETY SIX PUT THE BOTTLES IN THE WRONG 
BIN AND WAS UNABLE THEN TO GET THEM 
OUT NORWICH COUNCIL HAS AGREED TO 
PROVIDE AN ASSISTED COLLECTION FOR 
THE SECOND WORLD WAR VETERAN AFTER 
HIS DAUGHTER VICKY MARSHALL 
INTERVENED INTERVENED I CAN'T MAKE OUT WHAT YOU SHOULD 
PUT IN THE BLUE BIN L. L. KNOW YOU 
MUSTN'T PUT ANYTHING IT HAS TO BE 
STUFF THAT IS DRY 
WE HAVE TO SAVE 
THE PLANET I SAID HE'S SAVED THE 
PLANET HE SERVED FIVE YEARS IN 
WORLD WAR TWO SHE SAID I'M 
SORRY THE ONLY THING WE COULD DO 
WAS TO PUT AN ASSISTANT ON SO THEY 
CAN COME IN AND COLLECT THE BIN 
IT'S BAD ENOUGH HIM TRYING TO TAKE 
THE BIN OUTSIDE LET ALONE HAVING TO 
BRING IT IN WITH THE RUBBISH STILL 
LEFT INSIDE IT 
WE WANTED TO SHOW YOU DIDN'T WE 
THE FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY EXPRESS 
AGAIN IT IS ABOUT RECYCLING AND 
BINS AND MINISTERS PUSHING AHEAD 
WITH PLANS FOR PAY AS YOU THROW 
BIN TAXES DAYS AFTER GORDON BROWN 
SIGNALLED THEY WOULD BE AXED FIVE 
SCHEMES ARE BEING ROLLED OUT ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY WHICH COULD SLAP UP TO 
ONE THOUSAND YEAR ON EVERY FAMILY THAT 
FAILS TO RECYCLE ENOUGH LET'S TALK 
TO PETER ROBINSON WHO IS DIRECTOR 
OF THE RECYCLING CHARITY WASTE 
WATCH HE'S LIKE ALL OF US HE 
PAYS HIS COUNCIL TAX AND HE IS A 
CUSTOMER AND HE IS NINETY SIX 
HE HAS 
PARTICULAR NEEDS WHICH 
UNFORTUNATELY THE COUNCIL DIDN'T 
MEET TO START OFF WITH IN THIS 
PARTICULAR SITUATION THE COUNCIL 
HAS GOT AN ASSISTANCE SERVICE FOR 
PEOPLE LIKE LENNY NOW THEY KNOW 
HIS NEEDS THEY ARE TRYING TO HELP 
I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM THERE 
IS ONE SIDE DIDN'T KNOW THE OTHER 
SIDE'S NEEDS SO IT IS ABOUT 
COMMUNICATION AND HOW COUNCILS CAN 
HELP THEIR CUSTOMERS TO USE THE 
SERVICES BETTER 
I THINK EVERYBODY 
IS TRYING TO RECYCLE IT DOES SEEM 
TO BE THAT THE COUNCILS MAY BE 
BEING A LITTLE TOO DRACONIAN WHEN 
IT COMES TO THE RULES AND THE 
REGULATION WE HEARD ABOUT THE BIN 
THAT WOULDN'T CLOSE AND THE GUY WAS 
FINED AND REFUSED TO PAY THE FINE 
IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER WE HEAR 
LOTS OF PEOPLE WRITING IN TO US 
SAYING WE ARE DOING OUR BEST 
PLEASE DON'T PENALISE US 
YEAH L. 
THINK THE PUBLIC AT LARGE HAS GOT 
THE MESSAGE ABOUT RECYCLING 
ACTUALLY BUT THERE IS STILL A LONG 
WAY TO GO WE RECYCLE A THIRD OF 
OUR WASTE AT THE MOMENT BUT WE 
COULD BE RECYCLING UP TO SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT IT IS 
TRYING TO MOVE FROM WHERE WE ARE 
NOW TO TAKE ANOTHER STEP CHANGE 
REALLY AND PART OF THE SITUATION IS 
THAT THERE IS A VERY RAPID CHANGE 
IN SERVICES THAT COUNCILS ARE 
ROLLING OUT AND AGAIN IT IS ABOUT 
HOW THAT IS COMMUNICATED WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE STORY IN THE EXPRESS THE 
BIN TAX BOMBSHELL UP TO ONE THOUSAND A 
YEAR FOR EVERY FAMILY THAT FAILS TO 
RECYCLE ENOUGH IS THAT A 
POSSIBILITY 
I THINK IT'S NOT A POSSIBILITY REAL POSSIBILITY L. THINK THAT'S 
ACTUALLY QUITE MISINFORMED FIRST 
OF ALL THERE IS NOT A PROPOSAL TO 
BRING A NEW TAX IT IS A PROPOSAL 
TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT PEOPLE PAY 
FOR THEIR WASTE COLLECTIONS PEOPLE 
PAY THROUGH THEIR COUNCIL TAX 
CURRENTLY AND IT'S A FLAT RATE 
EVERYONE PAYS THE SAME AMOUNT 
REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH YOU RECYCLE 
SO THE PROPOSAL IS TO PENALISE 
THOSE WHO WON'T RECYCLE BUT TO GIVE 
INCENTIVES TO THOSE WHO WILL SO IF 
YOU RECYCLE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN YOU 
CAN RECYCLE UP TO SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE NORMAL 
HOUSEHOLD BIN YOU WILL PAY LESS IN 
YOUR COUNCIL TAX

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAINTAINING 
HEALTHY WORK LIFE BALANCE IT IS 
OFTEN A JUGGLING ACT ESPECIALLY IF 
YOU HAVE GOT CHILDREN PARENTS OF 
CHILDREN UP TO THE AGE OF SIXTEEN WILL 
HAVE THE RIGHT TO REQUEST FLEXIBLE 
WORKING HOURS NOT EVERYBODY IS 
HAPPY MANY SUPPORTERS THINK IT 
WOULD BE COMPLETELY UNMANAGEABLE 
IF WE HAVE A FLEXIBLE HOURS I WILL 
BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO WORK AS SOON 
AS POSSIBLE MANIAC AND PUT MY 
CHILD INTO DAY CARE MAYBE I CAN 
PUT MY CHILD INTO DAY CARE 
I CAN SEE IT WORKING IN 
MANUFACTURING YOU HAVE GOT SHIFT 
WORK MAYBE SOLICITORS MAYBE 
DOCTORS IN THE RETAIL ENVIRONMENT 
I DO NOT KNOW 
AT IT IS A GOOD IDEA THE DAYS OF 
NINE TO FIVE WERE GONE YOU NEED TO 
BE ADAPTABLE 
IF I HAD ANY CHILDREN OF MY OWN I 
THINK I WOULD PROBABLY LIKE TO WORK 
TWO OR THREE DAYS WEEK SO IT 
ALLOWS ME TIME TO SPEND WITH BY 
CHILDREN CHILDREN BATH HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT 
MOST PEOPLE I KNOW IN THE BUSINESS 
PROFESSION PREFER TO PICK UP THE 
SLACK OR PEOPLE HAVE GOT FAMILIES 
BECAUSE THEY RESPECT THAT WHEN THEY 
HAVE FAMILIES IT WILL BE DEALT WITH 
IN THE SAME WAY 
SOME OF YOUR VIEWS 
LET US HEAR FROM BAN MAY RUNNING 
AN IT CONSULTANCY AND ANDREA 
MATURE WHO WORKS FLEXIBLE HOURS 
AND JEAN A CLAW 
HOW DID YOU DO IT AT IT WAS ABOUT 
TWO MONTHS AGO 
I WAS WORKING AS A YOUTH WORKER IT 
WAS NOT PRACTICAL ANYMORE L. 
APPLIED FOR A JOB AT A CHILDREN'S 
CENTRE CENTRE I HAVE FIVE YEAR OLD AND TWO 
YEAR OLD EVEN ON EXPECTED THINGS 
LIKE I HAD TO PICK THE OTHERS WERE 
UP FROM SCHOOL THE OTHER WEEK AND 
THAT WAS FINE AMID THE HOURS OF 
LABOUR LABOUR A YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT FROM A 
CHILDREN'S WELFARE CHARITY YOU 
HAVE GOT THIRTY CHILDREN EXPECT THIRTY 
PEOPLE IN YOUR COMPANY 
HE HAD GOOD EMPLOYER RECOGNISES 
THAT TO BE FLEXIBLE IS REALLY 
IMPORTANT EVERY GOOD EMPLOYER 
FUNDAMENTALLY WE SUPPORT FLEXIBLE 
WORKING THIS IS ANOTHER GOVERNMENT 
LEGISLATION AFFECTING EMPLOYEE 
RIGHTS IT IS ALL VERY EXPENSIVE 
AND THAT MINISTERS ARE THE HEAVY 
AS MUCH AS WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO BE 
ABLE TO AGREE TO EVERY REQUEST FOR 
A FLEXIBLE WORKING WE CAN ONLY BE 
A GOOD EMPLOYER IF WE HAVE GOT 
PEOPLE TO DELIVER THE SERVICE TO 
HER CLIENTS AND THEREFORE MAINTAIN 
IS SIMILARLY ASKED YOU FOR FLEXIBLE 
WORKING HOURS YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE 
IT TO THEM 
A REGULATIONS IN BUT THE 
REGULATORS REQUIRE US TO GIVE IT 
CONSIDERATION THEY DO NOT REQUIRE 
US TO AGREE TO EVERY CASE BAK 
THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE US TO GIVE 
IT CONSIDERATION RECRUITING STAFF 
IN IT IS VERY DIFFICULT WE CANNOT 
OFFER FLEXIBLE WORKING YES WE'RE 
A LITTLE BIT 
SOME EMPLOYERS WOULD SAY THERE IN 
THE BUSINESS OF EMPLOYING PEOPLE 
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMPANY NOT 
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE WORKERS 
DEFINITELY I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT 
I WAS ORIGINALLY GOING TO GO FULL 
TIME I HAD TO SAY IT WAS NOT 
FINANCIALLY VIABLE FOR ME PUT 
THAT CLEARLY DOWN WAS GOING TO 
NEED TO NEGOTIATE PART TIME HOURS 
IN FEWER WORKING MORE HOURS YOU 
GET PAID MORE IF YOU ARE 
I WOULD HAVE GOT LESS HELP WITH MY 
CHILD CARE BECAUSE OF THE CHILD TAX 
CREDIT SYSTEM 
YOU CAN ASK FOR FLEXIBLE WORKING 
BUT IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN 
BUSINESS IS GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU 
WILL IT MAKE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE 
IN THE WORKPLACE BUSINESSES LIKE 
YOU COULD SAY THANKS FOR ASKING 
BUT NO 
IT DOES NOT MEAN HAVING TO WORK 
NEXT DAY IS LESS DAYS FLEXIBLE 
HOURS COULD MAIN THING AND THE 
SCHOOL RUN OR LINE PEOPLE TO WORK 
FROM HOME OCCASIONALLY FLEXIBLE 
WORKING IS NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT 
LAST DAYS 
SMALL BUSINESSES ARE NOT 
COMPELLED TO DO IT IF EMPLOYEES 
WANT TO WORK FEWER DAYS ARE FEWER 
HOURS AND EMPLOYEES EMPLOYERS 
ARE NOT PREPARED TO GIVE IT TO THEM 
IT WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING 
THIS RIGHT HAS EXISTED FOR PARENTS 
UP TO THE AGE OF SIX WE ARE 
EXTENDING THIS TO SIXTEEN NINETY PER CENT OF CASES 
APPLIED FOR SO FAR HAVE BEEN 
ACCEPTED 
BOARD LOVERS BIRD LOVERS OF FRED 
AFFAIR THEIR FEATHERED FRIENDS 
WITH SCRAPS OF BREAD FOR AGES BUT 
THAT MAY BE DOING MORE HARM THAN 
GOOD YOU SHOULD MAY BE PUT OUT 
SOMETHING ELSE LIKE CUP PASS THE OR 
CAKE TIM MOFFATT IS AT A GARDEN IN 
PETERBOROUGH HE HAS NOT BANISHED 
TO FIND AND THE LIKE WORDS YET 
MANAGED MANAGED IT IS NOT REAL REAL BIRDS NEVER 
TURN UP WHEN YOU WANT THEM TO IF 
THIS ONE WAS REAL AND I GIVE IT 
BRED I PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE DOING 
IT ANY FAVOURS RED IS NOT VERY 
GOOD FOR THEM CONFUSION REIGNS 
WHAT SHOULD BE BE FEEDING SKINNER 
WHY NOT 
NOW THE THING WITH BREAD IT WON'T 
DO BIRDS ANY HARM BUT IT WON'T DO 
THEM A LOT OF GOOD IT DOESN'T HOLD 
A LOT OF NUTRITIONAL VALUE AND WHEN 
THEY ARE BUSY FIELDING THEIR YOUNG 
THEY NEED FOOD WITH ENERGY IN IT 
THERE ARE MORE ALTERNATIVES TO 
BREAD THAT ARE EASY EASY TO COME BY 
LET'S CHECK THESE OUT THESE BIRDS 
REASON REAL 
VERY NICE INDEED WHY IS THIS 
GOOD SELECTION OF FOODS FOR BIRDS 
O. K. THINGS LIKE PORRIDGE OATS AND 
OTHER CEREALS GRATED CHEESE 
COOKED PASTA CRUMBED CAKES FRUITS 
THESE ARE THINGS WE HAVE LEFT OVER 
AFTER OUR DINNER AND PROVIDE MORE 
PROTEIN AND ENERGY 
SOME CAKES HAVE SUGAR IN IT A A LITTLE AND OFTEN IS A GREAT RULE TO 
GO BY WE ARE NOT SUGGESTING 
PUTTING OUT HOLE CAKES AND AND 
PILES AND PILES OF CAKES IT WILL 
GIVE THEM ENERGY WHICH IS THE 
IMPORTANT THING 
WE HAVE HAD QUESTIONS FROM VIEWERS 
ONE KIERAN SAYS IS IT APPROPRIATE 
TO FEED FOOD TO BIRDS WHICH HAVE 
EGGS IN IT SUCH AS CAKE AND PASTA 
THE THING WITH CAKE AND PASTA THEY 
ARE COOKED IT HAS EGG BUT WON'T

HITS THAT FOLLOWED SHERYL CROW 
BECAME ONE OF THE FINEST FEMALE 
SINGER SONGWRITERS OF HER 
GENERATION SHE SOLD THIRTY MILLION 
ALBUMS WORLDWIDE AND RECORDED HER 
SIXTH STUDIO ALBUM AND SHE IS HERE 
WITH US 
BEFORE WE HAVE A CHAT HERE IS A 
LISTEN TO HER LATEST SINGLE WHICH

LOOK BACK AGAIN 
YOUR FACE IS ALL AROUND ME 
YOUR KEYS ARE IN MY HAND 
AND EVERYWHERE I GO I TRY TO 
REMEMBER EXACTLY WHO I AM 
AND SHE 
IS HERE SHERYL CROW 
HOW ARE YOU GOOD GOOD YOU CAME TO SEE US FIVE YEARS AGO 
WHEN YOU HAD GREATEST HITS ALBUM 
THERE IS LOT OF WATER UNDER THE 
BRIDGE SINCE THEN 
YES A LOT OF 
WATER A LOT OF LIFE EXPERIENCE 
IS LOT OF THAT REFLECTED IN THE ALBUM 
YEAH L. L. THINK IT WAS A YEAR ALBUM AND A HALF AFTER I WAS DIAGNOSED 
WITH BREAST CANCER THAT I STARTED 
MAKING THE RECORD THE PROCESS WAS 
I RECORDED THE ALBUM IN MY 
HOME I HAVE A FARM OUT IN 
NASHVILLE IT WAS REALLY NICE IT 
WAS ISOLATED AND I HAD A THREE 
MONTH OLD BABY WHEN I STARTED 
MAKING THE RECORD SO THERE WAS A 
LOT OF LIFE EXPERIENCE IN FORMING 
THIS RECORD 
JUST IN TERMS OF YOUR CANCER HOW 
ARE YOU NOW 
I'M GREAT L. HAD MY 
M. R. I. AND MAMMOGRAM MY TWO YEAR AND 
SO I'M VERY CLEAR 
DO YOU HAVE TO DO CHEM OWE NO NO JUST RADIATION MY CANCER WAS 
CAUGHT VERY EARLY SO I'M AWARE OF 
BEING AWARE OF YOUR FAMILY HISTORY 
DID YOU HAVE THE CANCER DID YOU 
THINK THAT WAS IT FOR WHILE FOR 
YOUR SINGING CAREER IT MUST BE 
DEVASTATING THING 
WHEN YOU GET 
DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER IT 
DEFINITELY SCREECHES EVERYTHING TO 
A HALT AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN 
REALLY HEALTHY AND SO I WAS REALLY 
MET FACE TO FACE WITH MY FEGILITY 
IT FORMS THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AND 
TAUGHT ME HOW TO TAKE CARE OF 
MYSELF AND PUT MYSELF FIRST M. 
OVER THE YEAR AND A HALF YOU GOT 
STRONGER AND THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING 
INTO THE STUDIO AND DOING WRITING 
THAT'S THE IDEA BEHIND THE TITLE 
CALLED DETOURS YOU CAN BE ON ON 
AND FIND YOURSELF WAY OFF IT IT IS 
DETOURS TO REMIND YOU OF WHO YOU 
ARE ARE YOU ARE A POLITICAL PERSON THERE 
IS STUFF ABOUT IRAQ ON THERE YOU 
ARE FIRM ON THAT WHAT IS YOUR VIEW 
ON THAT 
WELL YOU KNOW IT IS 
INTERESTING BECAUSE RIGHT NOW 
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE 
PRIMARIES AND IT IS A VERY HEATED 
TIME IN AMERICA IN FACT I'VE NEVER 
SEEN COVERAGE OF A PRIMARY LIKE I'M 
SEEING IN EUROPE AND THE U. K. AND 
PEOPLE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN THIS 
THE LAST SEVEN YEARS FOR AMERICA 
HAS BEEN A SERIOUS DETOUR IT HAS 
TAKEN US SO FAR AWAY FROM WHAT OUR 
COUNTRY IS BASED ON ON AND WHO WE 
ARE AND NOW WE ARE RECEIVED AS 
ARROGANT PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO FEEL 
THAT BEING IN AN IMPERIALISTIC 
COUNTRY IS O. K. IT IS NOT WHO WE ARE 
DO YOU FEEL SOME OF THAT COMING 
TOWARDS YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL 
BECAUSE YOU'RE AMERICAN 
WELL OVER 
THE COURSE OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS 
I TRAVELLED A LOT OUTSIDE OF THE 
STATES AND ALSO LIVED OUTSIDE THE 
STATES QUITE A BIT AND I THINK THE 
PERCEPTION OF AMERICANS NOW IS VERY 
DAMAGED BY THIS ADMINISTRATION AND 
THE WAY THE WAR HAS BEEN HANDLED 
THE FACT THAT WE EVEN WENT TO A WAR 
I FIND TO BE AGGRIEVED BECAUSE IN 
MY ESTIMATE ACHES IT WAS REALLY A 
LOT OF DECEPTION THAT THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE WERE HANDED BY THE GREED 
AFFEW PEOPLE NOW WE ARE EMBARKING 
ON A NEW PERIOD IN OUR HISTORY WE 
WILL BE ABLE TO RESURRECT OUR GOOD 
TIME IT HAS BEEN DEMORALISING 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET INTO 
POLITICS 
NOT AT ALL POLITICS IS IT INTERESTING TO YOU 
IT IS 
ONLY INTERESTING TO ME IN SO FAR AS 
IT RELATES TO US AS PEOPLE THERE 
IS AN ARGUMENT FOR LOOKING AT WHERE 
YOU ARE IN YOUR HISTORY AND KNOWING 
THAT WHOEVER IS LEADING YOUR 
COUNTRY IS A PRETTY FAIR DEPICTION 
OF WHO WE ARE AS PEOPLE THERE IS 
NO MYSTERY OR ACCIDENT THAT DURB 
DURB GEORGE BUSH IS LEADER WE 
WERE ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL AND PEOPLE 
ARE WAKING UP 
HE HAD A TREMENDOUS 
AM OF SUPPORT ESPECIALLY IN THE 
MID WEST MID WEST THE FIRST ELECTION WAS THERE WAS 
A LOT OF OF SPECULATION AS TO 
WHETHER IT WAS FIXED OR BOTCHED OR 
EXACTLY 
WHO WON IT 
THE HANGING EXACTLY CHAD DEBARKLE 
YES YES THE SECOND ELECTION WHEN HE WAS RE 
ELECTED THERE WAS AN AMAZING 
CAMPAIGN OF FEAR THAT THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE WERE PUT THROUGH THAT THAT 
PEOPLE VOTED FOR HIM AS A LEADER 
IT IS INTRIGUING THAT YOU LIVE IN 
NASHVILLE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF AS A 
COUNTRY ARTIST YOUR MUSIC DOESN'T 
STRIKE ME THAT WAY 
RECORD SALES 
ARE REALLY DOWN AND IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO GET PLAYED AT RADIO NOW UNLESS 
YOU ARE A DANCE ARTIST OR R. AND AMP B. AND 
COUNTRY MUSIC HAS MADE A A A SWING 
TOWARDS BEING MORE POPULAR MUSIC 
ALTHOUGH I DON'T GET PLAYED THAT 
MUCH AT COUNTRY RADIO I FEEL AN 
AFIN AFFINITY WITH THE ART FORM 
WHY DID YOU LIVE IN NASHVILLE 
BECAUSE MY FAMILY LIVE DOWN THERE 
AND I ADOPTED A LITTLE BOY 
WHAT IS HIS NAME 
WHY AND THE 
WYATT 
HOW OLD IS HE

NIGHT'S APPRENTICE WAS ANYTHING BUT 
MARITAL BLISS THIS WEEK'S TASK WAS

THEY AT TASTEFUL THONG THE HARD 
SELL TECHNIQUE OF SARAH WAS ENOUGH 
TO MAKE ANY BRIDE CALL A WHOLE 
THING OFF LET US HAVE QUICK LOOK 
AT YOUR FINAL MOMENTS 
THIS TASK WAS LOST ON THE FIRST DAY 
AND IT IS BECAUSE YOU DID NOT 
RECOGNISE WHAT THIS WAS ABOUT THE 
CAPTURED AUDIENCE AND THE 
PASSIONATE CUSTOMERS SARAT FOR 
THE PAST EIGHT WEEKS THERE HAS BEEN 
LOTS OF SUGGESTIONS THAT YOU 
ACTUALLY DO NOT DO ANYTHING YOUR 
ARGUMENTS ARE ALWAYS VERY CONFUSING 
YOU HAVE ALIENATED CUSTOMERS THAT 
IS THE FEEDBACK MICHAEL I HAVE 
GOT A LIST AS LONG AS MY ARM ABOUT 
THE APOLOGIES PUTTING YOUR HANDS 
UP I DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY MORE 
TIMES I CAN LISTEN TO THAT NONSENSE 
I AM IN A DILEMMA AS TO WHO IS 
GOING TO GO 
ONE THING I AM SURE OF WHO IS 
GOING RIGHT NOW SARAH YOU'RE 
FIRED 
MORNING WHEN YOU GET THE BULLET 
YOU KNOW THAT YOU REALLY ARE IN THE 
FIRING LINE EVERYBODY GOES PRETTY 
QUICKLY BUT YOU MUST THINK WHAT 
RUN ISTRIA MIND 
HE JUST DID NOT KNOW WHAT IS GOING 
TO HAPPEN NEXT YOU DON'T KNOW WHO 
IS LOOKING AT ONE MINUTE YOU THINK 
HE IS NOT GOING TO FIRE ME THE 
NEXT SECONDS YOU THINK I DO 
NOT KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING DID NOT PERFORM WELL IN THE BOARDROOM 
THAT IS WHY I WENT 
IT IS NOT DOWN TO THAT IT IS DOWN 
TO HOW YOU MANAGE ALL THE TASKS WE 
GET THIS TAPE AND IT LEAVES A 
LITTLE BIT OFF AT THE END WE DID 
NOT LULL UNTIL THIS MORNING HE WAS 
FIRED I THOUGHT MICHAEL WAS GOING 
TO BE HERE L. REALLY DID 
WHEN I WENT INTO THE BOARDROOM I 
DID NOT REALLY PACK MY SUITCASE 
BECAUSE I REALLY DID NOT THINK I 
WAS GOING TO GET FIRED SIMPLY 
BECAUSE I REALLY WORKED HARD ON 
THAT TASK AND I THOUGHT THE MAJOR 
FUNDAMENTAL FLAW WAS THE CHOICE OF 
DRESSES 
WE NEED TO MAKE A DECISION FAIRLY 
QUICKLY QUICKLY I AM GOING TO START WITH IAN 
STEWART IT IS HIGHER VALUE SO IT 
IS HIGHER END SO IT IS BIGGER 
PROFIT 
WHAT ARE THE DRESSES LIKE PROFIT IMAGINE THE DRESSES FOR WOMEN WERE 
WEARING IN BEAUTY AND THE BEAST 
THEY ARE VERY MIXED VERY 
INTERNATIONAL THEY ARE VERY UNIQUE 
THEY ARE BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
PER DRESS THERE WILL BE A LOT OF 
PEOPLE WHO ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS 
DESIGNER TO ME IT IS THE WAY TO 
GO I HAVE NOT SEEN THE OTHER TWO 
THEY ARE VERY EXPENSIVE DRESS 
YEARS IF I AM GOING TO SPEND THAT 
MUCH MONEY ON A DRESS I WOULD WANT 
THE EXPERT THEY'RE SELLING THE JETS 
OURS IS HAVE THE PRIZE SELLING 
THE DRESS 
HAVING CONVINCED MICHAEL 
AND I THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA 
TO GO FOR A MIDDLE RANGE DRESSES L. 
HAD NOT THE SCENE THE GESTURE THAT 
HELEN WENT TO SEE SO I COULD NOT 
MAKE A JUDGMENT ON THEM WHERE TO 
GO WITH WHAT SHE SAID 
THE OTHER 
TEAM WENT WITH THE IAN STEWART 
DRESSES WHICH WERE VERY EXPENSIVE 
AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY GOT A 
BIT LUCKY IT WAS A HIGH RISK 
STRATEGY STRATEGY LADIES WERE COMING TO OUR STORE AND 
THEY HAD THE IAN STEWART DRESS 
LEAFLET THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT 
THEY WANTED THEY WERE ASKING US 
ABOUT THEM BECAUSE HE WAS ALREADY 
WELL KNOWN PEOPLE DO NOT JUST TO 
AN INSTANT FEW GRAND PURCHASE THEY 
THINK ABOUT IT PRIOR WE HAD SOME 
TACKY WEDDING DRESSES WHICH WERE 
DIFFICULT TO SHIFT 
HE SOLD A FIVE 
IF THAT IS DOWN TO ALEX 
WE DID NOT 
SELL THEM BECAUSE THE DRESSES WERE 
GOOD LOOKING WE SAW THEM BECAUSE 
ALEX WAS GOOD LOOKING 
YOU ARE BOTH ABSOLUTELY HOPELESS AT 
SELLING CAKES 
I WOULD NOT SAY AND WAS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR SELLING CAKES L. HAVE RESTARTED 
AFTER FOUR P. M. 
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THE REST OF THE 
DAY DAY WAS HELPING ALEX WE WERE PART OF 
THAT TEAM L. WAS BRINGING IN THE 
LADIES AND HE WAS TELLING THEM THEY 
LOOKED REALLY NICE AND FINISHING 
THE DEAL OFF THEN I SHIFTED TO THE 
CAKES MICHAEL HAD NOT SOLD 
ANYTHING FROM TEN THIRTY AM 
SOMETIMES IF YOU DO NOT PUSH 
YOURSELF AND YOU LOOK AROUND AND 
YOU DO NOT FIND THE SAME CAKE 
ANYONE ELSE 
CAN I HAVE A THINK 
ABOUT IT AND PHONE THE GROOM YOU YOU CAN 
SARAH CANNOT READ OTHER PEOPLE CAN VERY WELL YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE 
ALMOST GOING OF GOD 
A VERY NICE BUT I NEED TO SPEAK TO 
THE GROUP 
IS THERE SOMETHING WE 
CAN PAY THE DEPOSIT THEN TAKE 
THEN TALK TO THE GROUND 
SHE WAS QUITE PUSHY TRYING TO GET 
AT DEPOSIT AT A BUS IT PUT ME OFF 
A LITTLE BIT 
TO BE FAIR IT WAS 
NOT JUST YOU EITHER HERE IS 
MICHAEL USING HIS CHARM YOU'LL 
HAVE TO PAY TWO HUNDRED MORE FOR A 
TRADITIONAL CAKE AND IT WILL BE 
DULL THIS IS YOUR WEDDING YOU

TURNING AGAINST IT WHY WAS THAT 
I WAS QUITE SHOCKED WHEN THEY SAID 
THAT BECAUSE I DO NOT THINK I WAS 
LAZY AT ALL THEY DID NOT GOING 
THERE WITH THE STRATEGY HER GAME 
PLAN UP MY SLEEVE THOUGHT IF I 
WORKED HARD AT IT WREAKED HASKER

THE JOB WHEN THEY SAID LAZY I 
THOUGHT THAT IS A COMPLETE LIE 
TOOK A RUBBISH 
YOU HAVE GOT A VERY 
NICE PERSONALITY BUT IN BUSINESS

AGREE WITH YOU L. SHOULD HAVE 
DEFENDED YOU HAVE IT NOT MYSELF A 
BIT MORE AND MAYBE BEEN A BIT

THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE 
I HAVE LEARNED LOOKING AT MYSELF 
BACK IN THE BOARDROOM THE MENTAL 
AND EMOTIONAL STRESS GOT TO ME 
QUITE A LOT L. JUST NEED TO START 
DEFENDING MYSELF A LITTLE BIT MORE 
SPEAKING AT FEATURING PEOPLE KNOW 
WHAT I'M DOING L. WAS WORKING 
QUIETLY REALLY HARD AT THE TASK 
PEOPLE DO NOT REALISE HOW MUCH YOU 
HAVE PUT IN UNTIL YOU TELL THEM 
A SHAME YOU HAVE TO SHOUT AND 
SCREAM TO GET ON 
MAY BE NOT SHOUT AND SCREAM BUT IN 
THE HOUSE PEOPLE SAY WHAT THEY ARE 
GOOD AT 
YOU A BARRISTER AREN'T YOU YOU 
SHOULD KNOW HOW TO ARGUE 
I KNEW HOW TO DEFEND OTHER PEOPLE 
AND YOU HAD A STAND UP FOR MYSELF

ALL THESE LIES WERE COMING OUT AND 
I WAS THIS AND I WAS LAZY I COULD 
NOT TAKE ANY MORE MAYBE IT WAS THE 
RIGHT TIME FOR ME TO LEAVE MAYBE MAYBE IT WAS A GOOD EXPERIENCE FOR YOU IN
