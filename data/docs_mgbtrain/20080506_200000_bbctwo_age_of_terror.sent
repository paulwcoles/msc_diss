THIS PROGRAMME EXPLORES THE DEVASTATING HUMAN COST 
OF OSAMA BIN LADEN'S VIOLENT HOLY WAR AGAINST THE WEST 
FRIDAY AUGUST SEVENTH NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT 
TWO MEN IN A DELIVERY TRUCK SET OFF FROM A SUBURB OF THE KENYAN CAPITAL NAIROBI 
IN THE BACK ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED POUNDS OF EXPLOSIVES 
FORTY FIVE MINUTES LATER THE TRUCK PULLS UP AT THE REAR ENTRANCE OF THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY 
THE SYMBOL OF AMERICAN POWER IN AFRICA IS NO MORE 
OVER TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE KILLED THOUSANDS MORE INJURED 
THREE YEARS BEFORE NINE ELEVEN THIS WAS OSAMA BIN LADEN'S 
FIRST MAJOR STRIKE IN HIS JIHAD HIS HOLY WAR AGAINST AMERICA 
IT WAS A WHACK UPSIDE THE HEAD 
A MESSAGE THAT WE CHOSE NOT TO LISTEN TO BECAUSE 
WE WERE TONE DEAF TO TERRORISM AT THE TIME 
THE ATTACK TOOK AMERICA BY SURPRISE 
YET BIN LADEN HAD WARNED THE WORLD 
HE SAID I AM GOING TO TAKE AN INCREMENTAL JUMP IN VIOLENCE 
EVERY TIME WE ATTACK YOU UNTIL WE GET YOUR ATTENTION 
THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE 
HE WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS 
WE'RE NOT JUST BOMBING YOU TODAY 
THIS IS NEVER GOING TO END 
THIS IS A STORY OF UNHEEDED WARNINGS MISSED OPPORTUNITIES 
THE SLAUGHTER OF INNOCENTS 
OSAMA BIN LADEN'S WAR ON THE WEST 
IS THE LATEST BLOODY CHAPTER IN THE AGE OF TERROR 
MAY NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT 
TEN WEEKS BEFORE THE ATTACK ON THE AMERICAN EMBASSY 
AMERICAN JOURNALIST JOHN MILLER 
WAS HEADING FOR A DANGEROUS RENDEZVOUS ON THE PAKISTAN AFGHAN BORDER 
HIS ASSIGNMENT WAS AN INTERVIEW WITH OSAMA BIN LADEN WHO'D JUST ISSUED 
A FATWA A HOLY EDICT 
DECLARING WAR ON AMERICA AND ITS ALLIES 
MILLER'S MISSION WAS SHROUDED IN SECRECY 
TO ENSURE MAXIMUM SECURITY HE'D AGREED TO PUT HIMSELF IN AL QAEDA'S HANDS 
THEY HAD PURCHASED PLANE TICKETS IN ADVANCE FOR CASH 
THEY HAD FLOWN US FROM PLACE TO PLACE 
BUT WE NEVER KNEW WHERE WE WERE GOING TILL WE WERE GETTING OFF THE PLANE THERE 
WE CROSSED THE BORDER IN THE DARKNESS AND WHEN WE GOT TO THE OTHER SIDE 
THERE WAS THE TRUCK WAITING FOR US AND WE GOT ON AND 
AND WE WERE OFF AGAIN 
EVENTUALLY MILLER AND HIS TEAM 
REACHED AN AL QAEDA CAMP BURIED DEEP IN THE MOUNTAINS 
BIN LADEN ARRIVES IN A CAVALCADE A MOTORCADE OF THREE SUVS HE GETS OUT SURROUNDED BY BODYGUARDS 
WHEN HE GETS OUT EVERYBODY POINTS THEIR GUNS IN THE AIR 
AND THEY HAVE TRACER ROUNDS SO YOU CAN SEE THEM BEING FIRED THROUGH THE NIGHT 
AND THEY LAUNCH FIREWORKS AND ROCKETS AND GUNFIRE 
AND BIN LADEN IS MOVING IN THIS CATERPILLAR OF ARMS AND LEGS 
AND BODYGUARDS FROM THE CARS TOWARDS THIS LITTLE HUT WHERE 
WE'RE GOING TO DO THE INTERVIEW 
BIN LADEN HAD DEMANDED A LIST OF MILLER'S QUESTIONS IN ADVANCE 
JUST BEFORE FILMING HIS NUMBER TWO AYMAN ZAWAHIRI APPROACHED MILLER 
AND HE SAID I HAVE VERY GOOD NEWS FOR YOU 
MR. BIN LADEN HAS AGREED TO ANSWER EACH ONE OF YOUR QUESTIONS 
AND I SAID EXCELLENT 
HE SAID THERE IS ONE THING I SAID WHAT'S THAT 
HE SAID WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TRANSLATE HIS ANSWERS TO YOU AND I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED 
I SAID HOW AM I GOING TO ASK THE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS 
HE SAID THIS WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM THERE WILL BE NO FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS 
STAND BY STANDING BY 
MR. BIN LADEN YOU HAVE ISSUED A FATWA 
CALLING ON MUSLIMS TO KILL AMERICANS WHERE THEY CAN WHEN THEY CAN 
IS THAT DIRECTED AT ALL AMERICANS 
THE INTERVIEW OVER MILLER TURNED TO ZAWAHIRI 
AND ASKED HIM WHEN AMERICA MIGHT EXPECT BIN LADEN'S WAR TO BEGIN 
AND HE SAID OH YOU WILL SEE THE RESULTS OF THIS FATWA IN THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS 
I REMEMBER WALKING AWAY FROM THAT SAYING THAT'S A LITTLE UNUSUAL 
USUALLY THEY MAKE A THREAT FROM A TERRORIST GROUP 
THEY DON'T PUT A TIME LIMIT ON IT 
THEY DON'T FORESHADOW THAT MUCH 
AND HERE THEY'RE TRYING TO TELL US SOMETHING'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN 
THIS WAS A WARNING IN LIGHTS BUT FEW SAW IT AT THE TIME INCLUDING MYSELF 
LIKE MANY OTHERS I WAS ONLY DIMLY FAMILIAR WITH THE NAME OSAMA BIN LADEN 
IN THE SPRING OF NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WHILE BIN LADEN WAS PLOTTING WAR AGAINST AMERICA 
POLITICAL MINDS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC WERE FOCUSED ON EVENTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
I'D BEEN REPORTING THE CONFLICT FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY 
TALKING TO ALL SIDES FROM MEN OF VIOLENCE TO MEN OF GOD 
AND IF THAT SIR IS THE SORT OF THING YOU THINK 
YOU'LL GET DEMOCRACY IN NORTHERN IRELAND GET YOU BACK TO ENGLAND 
AND NOW IT SEEMED THAT ELUSIVE PEACE MIGHT AT LAST BE AT HAND 
IN APRIL NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THE HISTORIC GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED 
I WAS AT STORMONT THROUGHOUT THAT LONG COLD SLEEPLESS NIGHT 
I REMEMBER THINKING THE AGE OF TERROR MIGHT FINALLY BE COMING TO AN END 
BUT AT THE TIME I'D GOT NO IDEA THAT A FAR MORE DEADLY CONFLICT 
WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN A CONFLICT THAT HAD BEEN 
SO DRAMATICALLY ANNOUNCED 
TO THE WORLD BY BIN LADEN 
THE AGE OF TERROR WAS ABOUT TO ENTER A NEW PHASE IT WAS ABOUT TO GO GLOBAL 
NAIROBI KENYA 
POPULATION TWO MILLION 
TARGETED BY BIN LADEN AS THE STAGE ON WHICH TO LAUNCH HIS WAR ON AMERICA 
THE U. S. EMBASSY WAS LOCATED IN THE CITY CENTRE 
AT A BUSY JUNCTION 
LEE REED WAS A SENIOR SECURITY OFFICER AT THE EMBASSY 
WHERE HE'D BEEN POSTED WITH HIS WIFE 
EIGHT MONTHS BEFORE THE BOMBING HE SENT HIS BOSSES A FORMAL REPORT 
WARNING THAT THE EMBASSY WAS AT RISK 
WE HAD CONDUCTED A SECURITY SURVEY IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF NINETY EIGHT 
WHERE WE EXAMINED THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE EMBASSY 
AND STUDIED IT AND REALISED THAT THE EMBASSY WAS VERY VULNERABLE 
TO TRUCK AND CAR BOMB ATTACK 
IN FACT I TOOK A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE EXACT LOCATION 
THE BOMB EVENTUALLY WENT OFF AT 
AND PLACED IT IN A REPORT 
YOU PUT THIS IN A REPORT 
YES AND SENT IT OFF TO WASHINGTON 
AROUND THE SAME TIME 
A MAN WALKED IN OFF THE STREET TO WARN THE EMBASSY ABOUT A BOMB PLOT 
THE WALK IN ADVISED US THAT 
WE WERE UNDER THREAT OF A TRUCK BOMB 
A TRUCK BOMB A TRUCK BOMB 
THE INFORMATION WAS TAKEN AND SENT BACK TO C. I. A. 
AND I WAS TOLD THAT 
THE MAN WAS A FABRICATOR 
AND THEREFORE WE DID NOT NEED TO TAKE HEED OF WHAT HE HAD SAID 
IN THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE BOMBING 
AMBASSADOR PRUDENCE BUSHNELL REPEATEDLY CONTACTED WASHINGTON 
WARNING OF HER GROWING CONCERN ABOUT SECURITY 
EVENTUALLY SHE WENT TO THE VERY TOP 
TO SECRETARY OF STATE MADELEINE ALBRIGHT 
I WROTE TO SECRETARY ALBRIGHT AFTER I HAD BEEN TOLD BY PEOPLE 
AT MID LEVELS TO KNOCK IT OFF 
AND BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS ACCOUNTABLE FOR MY COMMUNITY'S SECURITY 
WHAT I WROTE TO HER WAS ABOUT THE FACT 
THAT THE EMBASSY WAS VULNERABLE 
AND WHAT DID SECRETARY ALBRIGHT SAY IN REPLY TO YOU 
I NEVER GOT A REPLY 
NO REPLY NO 
NO 
THE STEADY STREAM OF WARNINGS DID REGISTER 
BUT THE RESPONSE WAS NOT ENOUGH 
BIN LADEN HAD ALREADY IDENTIFIED 
THE EMBASSY'S ACHILLES HEEL LONG AGO 
BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR HE'D SCRUTINISED PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE BUILDING 
AND PERSONALLY IDENTIFIED THE OPTIMUM PLACE TO PLANT A BOMB 
WHEN IT COMES TO PLANNING AL QAEDA IS IN A LEAGUE OF ITS OWN 
THE I. R. A. MIGHT HAVE PLANNED MONTHS AHEAD 
AL QAEDA PLANNED IN YEARS 
BIN LADEN WAS GRADUALLY BUILDING UP A NETWORK A SECRET NETWORK 
OF RADICAL ISLAMIST GROUPS AROUND THE WORLD 
NOW MANY OF THEM WERE ALREADY FIGHTING THEIR OWN LOCAL CONFLICTS 
BUT THEY BECAME INCREASINGLY RECEPTIVE TO BIN LADEN'S CALL FOR GLOBAL JIHAD 
THAT'S HOLY WAR AGAINST AMERICA AND THE WEST 
MOMBASA ON THE EAST COAST OF KENYA WHERE RADICAL ISLAM HAD TAKEN ROOT 
AN AL QAEDA SLEEPER CELL HAD BEEN OPERATING HERE 
UNDETECTED SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR 
SHORTLY AFTER BIN LADEN PINPOINTED THE EMBASSY CELL MEMBERS MOVED IN 
SET UP A FISHING BUSINESS 
MARRIED LOCAL WOMEN AND EVEN STARTED FAMILIES 
THE CELL WOULD LIE LOW FOR FOUR YEARS 
THE CELL OPERATING IN MOMBASA HAD SIGNIFICANT COVER 
THERE WAS A LOT OF SUPPORT IN THE AREA FOR RADICAL FUNDAMENTALISTS 
AND THERE WERE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN 
SHIPPING AND TRANSPORTING WEAPONS 
IN FACT WE BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL 
WAS BROUGHT INTO EAST AFRICA THROUGH A BOAT 
AND THEY WERE ALLOWED TO OPERATE FREELY IN THE MOMBASA AREA 
THE C. I. A. AND F. B. I. WERE AWARE OF THE GROWING THREAT FROM BIN LADEN 
AND WERE MONITORING HIS ACTIVITIES THROUGH A SECRET UNIT KNOWN AS ALEC STATION 
HOW DID YOU RATE BIN LADEN AS A THREAT AT THAT TIME 
I THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY THAT WE WERE MOST CONCERNED 
BY THE GEOGRAPHIC BREADTH OF HIS ACTIVITIES 
WE FRANKLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF A THREAT HE WAS BUT HE HATED US 
HE HAD HIS OWN SOURCES OF MONEY AND ARMS AND WE COULDN'T GET NEAR HIM 
A YEAR BEFORE THE BOMBING 
ALEC STATION PLANNED AN OPERATION TO DISRUPT AN AL QAEDA CELL IN NAIROBI 
THEY RAIDED A HOUSE SEIZED A LAPTOP 
AND RETRIEVED A DELETED LETTER FROM THE HARD DRIVE 
IT REVEALED THAT AL QAEDA MEMBERS IN KENYA 
WERE AWAITING BIN LADEN'S INSTRUCTION TO STRIKE 
THEY CAME TANTALISINGLY CLOSE TO UNCOVERING THE PLOT 
BUT CRITICALLY FAILED TO IDENTIFY THE SLEEPER CELL IN MOMBASA 
BY THIS TIME ALEC STATION WAS WORKING ON AN AUDACIOUS SCHEME 
TO STRIKE AT THE HEART OF AL QAEDA 
THEY WERE PLANNING TO KIDNAP BIN LADEN 
THE PLAN WAS TO GO IN AT NIGHT INTO THE COMPOUND THAT HE LIVED IN 
IN TARNAK FARM AND TRY TO SPIRIT HIM OUT OF THERE 
TRY TO SPIRIT HIM OUT 
YES GRAB HIM AND TAKE HIM OUT WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO KILL HIM 
WE HAD TO PLAN IT AS AN OPERATION TO KIDNAP HIM 
THE OPERATION WAS PLANNED WITH METICULOUS ATTENTION TO DETAIL 
WE HAD C. I. A. ENGINEERS BUILD 
AN ERGONOMICALLY COMFORTABLE CHAIR FOR HIM WELL PADDED VERY COMFORTABLE 
AND ALSO THE SHACKLES HAD TO BE PADDED 
SO THERE WOULD BE NO ABRASIONS OR BRUISES ON HIS ARMS OR LEGS 
OR WHEREVER HE WAS BOUND 
IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WERE SO CONCERNED ABOUT HIS SAFETY 
THAT OUR LAWYER WAS TOLD TO BRING ALONG THE KINDS OF TAPE 
WE MIGHT USE TO CLOSE BIN LADEN'S MOUTH 
IN CASE IT WAS NECESSARY TO KEEP HIM SILENT 
SO OUR LAWYER TOOK DOWN A CLEAR PLASTIC TAPE DUCT TAPE AND ADHESIVE 
AND THE LAWYER SAT AROUND PLAYING WITH THE TAPE 
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH WOULD BE LEAST ABRASIVE TO HIS FACIAL HAIR 
BUT BIN LADEN'S FACIAL HAIR WOULD REMAIN INTACT 
SENIOR OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON WERE RELUCTANT TO GIVE THE GREEN LIGHT 
JUST TEN WEEKS BEFORE THE EMBASSY BOMBING 
THE KIDNAP PLAN WAS DROPPED 
WHY WAS IT CANCELLED 
I THINK THERE WAS A NUMBER OF REASONS 
MR. CLINTON AND THE CABINET HAD TALKED ABOUT IT FOR SEVERAL DAYS 
AND DECIDED IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS 
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE OUR ASSETS 
AND THEY WERE AFRAID IF BIN LADEN WAS KILLED 
THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE ACCUSED OF ASSASSINATION 
BY THIS TIME TWO SAUDIS HAD ALREADY BEEN SELECTED FOR THE SUICIDE MISSION IN NAIROBI 
JIHAD MOHAMMED ALI AND MOHAMMED AL OWHALI 
WERE NOW PREPARING THEMSELVES FOR MARTYRDOM 
MEN LIKE AL OWHALI AND JIHAD ALI 
ARE BIN LADEN'S MOST DEVASTATING WEAPON SUICIDE BOMBERS 
I REMEMBER INTERVIEWING ONE WOULD BE SUICIDE BOMBER IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
AND BEING STRUCK BY HIS UNQUESTIONING COMMITMENT TO HIS CAUSE 
AND HIS DETERMINATION TO KILL HIMSELF AND MANY OTHERS 
ALL IN THE NAME OF ALLAH 
THIS IS A DUTY GOD REQUIRES OF US 
FIGHTING FOR HIS SAKE AND KILLING THE ENEMY 
I GO INTO BATTLE TO KILL AND TO GET KILLED 
AND I ASK GOD TO SEND ME TO PARADISE 
TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE ATTACK ON THE EMBASSY 
AN AL QAEDA EXPLOSIVES EXPERT ARRIVED IN NAIROBI 
AND BEGAN ASSEMBLING A BOMB POWERFUL ENOUGH 
TO REDUCE THE BUILDING TO RUBBLE 
AL OWHALI AND JIHAD ALI WERE REUNITED IN THE BOMB MAKER'S RENTED HOUSE 
FOUR DAYS BEFORE THE ATTACK 
TOGETHER THEY WENT THROUGH THE DETAILS OF THE PLAN 
MEANWHILE THE CELL IN MOMBASA 
WHICH HAD SMUGGLED IN THE EXPLOSIVES WAS ORDERED TO DISPERSE 
LEAVING WIVES AND CHILDREN BEHIND 
THEY QUIETLY SLIPPED OUT OF THE COUNTRY 
ON THE MORNING OF FRIDAY AUGUST SEVENTH 
AL OWHALI AND JIHAD ALI SET OFF IN A TRUCK LOADED WITH EXPLOSIVES 
AL OWHALI WAS CARRYING A GUN AND FOUR GRENADES 
ELLEN BOMER HAD BEEN WORKING AT THE EMBASSY FOR JUST FOUR WEEKS 
I CAN REMEMBER IT AS CLEAR AS IF IT WAS YESTERDAY SOMETIMES 
I HAD MY CAPPUCCINO I DID THAT EVERY MORNING 
I USED TO WORK AS A DRIVER AT THE AGRICULTURAL OFFICE 
OF THE U. S. EMBASSY 
AND I WAS GETTING PREPARED FOR A TRIP 
NAOMI KERONGA WORKED FOR THE KENYAN GOVERNMENT IN THE TWENTY TWO STOREY BUILDING 
RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THE EMBASSY 
THAT MORNING SEVENTH AUGUST FRIDAY 
I WAS IN MY OFFICE IN CO OPERATIVE HOUSE TENTH FLOOR 
I WAS IN THE BUILDING ACROSS FROM THE SMALL PARKING LOT 
THAT WAS IN THE REAR OF OUR EMBASSY 
I WAS SPEAKING WITH THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE 
THAT MORNING I WAS AT THE BACK GATE OF THE EMBASSY 
THE PLACE WHERE VEHICLES LOAD AND OFF LOAD PARCELS 
ON MY WAY TO THE SECOND FLOOR I STOPPED IN FIRST FLOOR 
NEAR THE BANK 
AND THERE WERE A QUEUE 
SO I DECIDED TO GO AHEAD TO MY OFFICE 
WHEN THE TRUCK PULLED UP AT THE BACK OF THE EMBASSY 
AL OWHALI JUMPED OUT AND ASKED THE SECURITY GUARD TO OPEN THE GATE 
THE GUARD WAS SUSPICIOUS AND PLAYED FOR TIME 
I SAID YES I WILL OPEN THE GATE THAT'S MY JOB 
BUT I HAVEN'T GOT THE KEYS AT THE MOMENT 
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO THE RECEPTION 
AL OWHALI REACHED FOR HIS GRENADES 
IT WAS JUST ME AND THE DRIVER 
AND WE WERE BOTH STANDING THERE AND WE HEARD THIS LOUD 
WE WENT TO THE WINDOW TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON 
MOST PEOPLE GOT UP AND WENT TO THE WINDOW 
I SAID WHAT WAS THAT AND HE SAID I DON'T KNOW LET ME LOOK 
STUCK OUTSIDE THE GATE JIHAD ALI DECIDED THE MOMENT HAD COME 
THERE WAS A VERY HUGE BLAST 
AND THE BUILDING COOPERATIVE HOUSE WAS PULLED UP SHAKEN AROUND 
AND PRESSED DOWN 
THE BOMB RIPPED THROUGH THE EMBASSY AND THE HIGH RISE COOPERATIVE BUILDING OPPOSITE 
THE OFFICE BLOCK SANDWICHED BETWEEN THEM COLLAPSED LIKE A PACK OF CARDS 
OVER TWO HUNDRED DIED THOUSANDS WERE INJURED 
IF YOU ARE IN A BUILDING BOMBING WHAT HAPPENS IS 
THE BLAST OF THE BOMB COMES THROUGH THE BUILDING LIKE A TIDAL WAVE 
IT BREAKS GLASS AND FORMS SABRES GOES THROUGH 
AND SOME OF THE GLASS IS SO FINE IT WILL GO THROUGH YOUR CLOTHES 
AND EMBED IN YOUR BODY BUT YOUR CLOTHES WON'T BE TORN 
I LOST MY CONSCIOUSNESS I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING 
I RAISED UP AND STARTED TO RUN AROUND TO FIND A WAY OUT 
TO FIND WHAT IS WRONG 
I WAS THROWN ACROSS THE ROOM 
KNOCKED OUT JUST MOMENTARILY 
SECONDS LATER ONE OF MY AMERICAN COLLEAGUES CAME RUSHING IN 
AND SAYING AMBASSADOR WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE 
AND WE WALKED DOWN TWENTY ONE FLIGHTS OF STAIRS 
WITH HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS 
OF SILENT BLEEDING KENYANS 
WHO WERE UTTERLY CALM 
IT CREATES AN INSTANT DARKNESS AND THE DUST LEVEL IS SO HIGH 
YOU CAN'T BREATHE AND YOU'RE DISORIENTATED YOU'RE INJURED 
SO YOU REACH OUT IN THE DARKNESS AND YOU TOUCH THE WALLS 
AND YOU TRY TO FEEL YOUR WAY ALONG THE WALLS SO YOU WILL FIND 
BLOODY HAND PRINTS ON THE WALLS OF BOMBED BUILDINGS FOR THAT REASON 
I WAS JUST TRYING TO SEE HOW I CAN LEAVE THE BUILDING ALIVE 
AND THE ONE WHO REALLY FINISHED US MOST IS THE ONE WHO SAID THERE IS FIRE 
SOMEBODY SHOUTED HURRY UP THERE'S FIRE 
THE HUMAN MIND IS AN AMAZING THING I REMEMBER THINKING 
SEEING THE SMOKE AND THINKING 
WELL AT LEAST I'M NOT GOING TO BURN TO DEATH 
I'LL DIE OF ASPHYXIATION 
THERE IS FIRE IT IS CATCHING WHERE 
AM I ON FIRE 
WILL I EVER REACH DOWN 
AM I DEAD 
AM I DYING 
IT WAS NOT UNTIL I GOT OUT OF THAT BUILDING 
THAT I SAW WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE EMBASSY 
INSIDE THE SHATTERED EMBASSY COVERED IN RUBBLE 
ELLEN BOMER WAS REGAINING CONSCIOUSNESS 
I WAS LAYING LIKE THIS ON MY BACK AND I TRIED TO GET UP 
AND I COULDN'T GET UP AND THEN I THOUGHT IT WAS A BOMB 
IT WAS A BOMB 
AND THEN I THOUGHT 
DO I HURT ANYWHERE AM I HURT 
IS ANYTHING HURT 
AND I THOUGHT NO I DON'T FEEL ANY PAIN ANYWHERE NOTHING'S HURT 
AND THEN 
MY NEXT THOUGHT WAS WELL I CAN'T SEE 
AND I THOUGHT WELL THAT'S JUST MOMENTARY 
THAT'S GONNA PASS 
AND THEN I THOUGHT OH WELL IT MIGHT NOT PASS 
AND THEN I THOUGHT 
O. K. GOD YOU CAN HAVE ONE EYE DON'T TAKE BOTH EYES 
YOU CAN HAVE ONE 
LET ME HAVE ONE AND I'LL LET YOU HAVE THE OTHER 
TEN MINUTES AFTER THE EXPLOSION IN NAIROBI 
HORROR WAS PILED UPON HORROR 
FOUR HUNDRED MILES AWAY A SECOND TRUCK BOMB EXPLODED AT THE U. S. EMBASSY IN DAR ES SALAAM TANZANIA 
TWELVE PEOPLE DIED 
NEARLY ONE HUNDRED WOUNDED 
I WAS SHOCKED 
I WAS REALLY ASTONISHED BY THE TRADECRAFT 
BY THE SKILL WITH WHICH THESE ATTACKS HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT 
YOU ONLY HAD TO LOOK AT THE FIRST PICTURES 
TO RECOGNISE THAT THIS WAS A DIFFERENT KIND OF TERROR 
THAT THIS WAS TERROR AIMED AT MASS CASUALTIES 
IN A WAY THAT MOST PREVIOUS ATTACKS HAD NOT 
I WAS STRUCK BY THE DEVASTATION OF THE BOMBING 
AND THAT IMMEDIATELY TOLD ME WHEN I SAW THAT 
OF THE CAPABILITIES OF THIS ORGANISATION 
WE WERE NOT DEALING WITH ISOLATED SMALL GROUPS OF POTENTIAL EXTREMISTS 
WE WERE DEALING WITH AN ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE 
THAT HAD PLANNED THOUGHT IT OUT PUT ALL THE MECHANICS IN PLACE 
AND SUCCESSFULLY CARRIED IT OUT 
NEWS OF THE TWIN ATTACKS SOON REACHED THE MAN 
WHO'D INTERVIEWED OSAMA BIN LADEN ONLY TEN WEEKS BEFORE 
I WAS ON A FISHING BOAT 
SEVENTY MILES OFF THE COAST OF MONTAUK POINT IN NEW YORK 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN AND MY CELL PHONE RANG 
TWO U. S. EMBASSIES HAVE JUST BEEN BLOWN TO BITS IN EAST AFRICA 
IN TANZANIA AND IN KENYA 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT 
THEY WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE ISSUES IN EAST AFRICA 
WHAT ARE THE GROUPS WHAT ARE THE ISSUES WITH THOSE COUNTRIES 
AND I SAID NO IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT IT'S ABOUT US 
THIS IS OSAMA BIN LADEN 
THIS WAR THAT HE DECLARED ON AMERICA 
IT JUST STARTED 
STEVE GAUDIN WAS AN F. B. I. AGENT WITH ZERO EXPERIENCE OF TERRORISM 
HE WAS ON VACATION WHEN THE BOMBS WENT OFF 
I WAS ACTUALLY AT THE BEACH AND MY PAGER HAD GONE OFF 
TO CALL THE NEW YORK OFFICE OF THE F. B. I. 
NOT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON 
I HAD NO TELEVISION OR ANYTHING 
SO I RESPOND TO THE PAGE AND ONE OF MY WORKMATES SAYS 
YOU NEED TO GET INTO THE OFFICE RIGHT AWAY 
WHAT WERE YOU WEARING I GOT MY BATHING SUIT AND A TANK TOP 
PROBABLY IS ALL I HAD ON AND SOME FLIP FLOPS 
THEY SAID AT LEAST YOU'RE DRESSED FOR THE OCCASION 
I SAID I JUST GOT A PAGE AND I JUST SHOWED UP 
THEY SAID GOOD GO HOME AND PACK 
YOU'RE GOING TO EITHER NAIROBI KENYA OR DAR ES SALAAM TANZANIA 
AND I SAID I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE DAR ES SALAAM TANZANIA IS 
THEY SAID GO HOME GET YOUR PASSPORT GET BACK HERE 
IN NAIROBI LEE REED AND HIS TEAM WERE DESPERATELY SEARCHING FOR SURVIVORS 
WE HAD DUG WITH OUR BARE HANDS AND MINOR TOOLS 
KNOCKING DOWN DOORS DOING EVERYTHING WE COULD 
THROUGH AREAS WHERE WE KNEW PEOPLE WERE MISSING 
FORCING HIS WAY THROUGH THE RUBBLE AND CARNAGE 
REED SPOTTED A FOOT STICKING OUT OF THE DEBRIS 
SO WE THOUGHT WELL THIS IS EITHER A BODY PART OR SOMEONE WHO IS DEAD 
BUT YOU DON'T ASSUME THAT 
YOU HAVE TO DIG THEM OUT BECAUSE THEY COULD BE ALIVE 
AND WE DUG AND DUG AND GOT DOWN TO HIS BODY 
AND HE WAS MISSING PART OF HIS HAND AND YOU COULD SEE 
HIS SKULL WAS INJURED AND YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE HIS BRAIN 
AND SO WE THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD 
THEY THOUGHT I WAS DEAD 
IT'S ONLY THAT SOMEBODY TOUCHED ME 
AND I WAS STILL HOT AND THEY DECIDED TO TAKE ME TO HOSPITAL 
SIX HOURS AFTER THE EXPLOSION 
ELLEN BOMER WAS STILL TRAPPED IN THE RUBBLE 
I FELT THINGS BEING TAKEN OFF OF ME 
LIFTED FROM ME AND I FELT HANDS PULLING AT ME 
AND THEN SOMEBODY PULLED THIS ARM 
AND I REMEMBER I SCREAMED AND THEN THEY PUT ME ON THIS STRETCHER 
I WAS SO SAD 
IT WAS THE SADDEST EVENT I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED 
TO LOOK INTO THE FACES OF PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR FAMILY 
LOST THEIR LIVELIHOOD LOST LIMBS 
LOST THEIR SOUL 
SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE CLOSE TO AN AMERICAN GOVERNMENT FACILITY 
AND I WAS THE FACE OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT 
THAT AFTERNOON SECRETARY OF STATE MADELEINE ALBRIGHT MANAGED TO GET THROUGH TO HER AMBASSADOR 
WHAT DID SECRETARY ALBRIGHT SAY TO YOU ON THE TELEPHONE 
SHE SAID MY GOD PRU I NEVER KNEW YOUR BUILDING WAS SO VULNERABLE 
AND I SAID MADAM SECRETARY I SENT YOU A LETTER 
AND THERE WAS SILENCE AT THE OTHER END 
FORTY EIGHT HOURS AFTER THE EXPLOSION THE F. B. I. TEAM ARRIVED AT THE SCENE 
THERE WERE STILL FLAMES I REMEMBER THAT 
THE SMELL OF JUST BURNT EVERYTHING 
BURNT GASOLINE BURNT BODIES BURNT EVERYTHING 
AND THE CROWDS OF PEOPLE THAT WERE AROUND THERE 
THERE HAD TO BE A MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS VERY SMALL AREA 
AND YOU COULD STILL SEE MARINES WRENCHING BARBED WIRE TO TRY AND KEEP THE PLACE SECURE 
RESCUE CREWS STILL TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE 
REGULAR KENYAN CITIZENS CLIMBING ON TOP OF RUBBLE LOOKING FOR RELATIVES 
OR JUST ANYBODY TRYING TO HELP 
I CAN REMEMBER TAKING A PHOTOGRAPH OF ALL OF US THERE 
EVERYBODY'S GOT THIS BEWILDERED FACE 
AND WE'RE JUST ALL LOOKING AT THIS EMBASSY 
THE LOOK ON THE FACES OF THE AGENTS 
WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE RUBBLE AND THE TASK AHEAD OF US 
WAS JUST INCREDIBLE 
WE HAD QUITE A MISSION TO ACCOMPLISH NINE THOUSAND MILES FROM HOME 
WITHOUT A LOT OF CAPABILITIES 
THE F. B. I. HAS AT ITS DISPOSAL IN THE UNITED STATES 
IN A MAKESHIFT OFFICE IN NAIROBI F. B. I. AGENT DEBBIE DORAN 
WAS SOON SIFTING CALLS FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC 
ONE CALLER TOLD HER A SUSPICIOUS STRANGER HAD CHECKED INTO A LOCAL HOTEL 
WHAT DID HE SAY ABOUT THIS PERSON 
HE SAID THIS PERSON HAD BEEN INJURED IN THE BOMBING 
HE'D BEEN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD PRIOR TO THE BOMBING 
HE'D COME BACK TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AFTER THE BOMBING INJURED 
HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDENTITY DOCUMENTS 
HE HAD NOTHING AND WAS REFUSING HELP 
SO THESE PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS ODD 
DID WE KNOW WE HAD SOMEONE INVOLVED IN THE BOMBING NO 
BUT WE KNEW THAT WE HAD TO FIND OUT WHO THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS 
AND WHERE HE WAS AT TIME OF BOMBING AND WHAT HE WAS INVOLVED IN 
THE CALLER SAID THE STRANGER WAS STAYING IN A SUBURB CALLED EASTLEIGH 
PAT D'AMURO CALLED IN STEVE GAUDIN 
AND WE'RE TOLD HERE'S YOUR LEAD 
AND IT COMES TO YOU ON A HANDWRITTEN PIECE OF PAPER 
WE WANT YOU TO GO TO EASTLEIGH NAIROBI 
IT'S ABOUT HALF HOUR DRIVE OUTSIDE OF THE CITY CENTRE 
AND WE WANT YOU TO FIND A MAN WHO JUST DOESN'T FIT IN 
I SAID THAT'S MY LEAD PAT 
THAT'S WHAT THIS TERRORISM INVESTIGATION IS ALL ABOUT 
SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T FIT IN 
HE'S LIKE IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT LEAD STEVE 
I'VE GOT ONE HUNDRED OTHERS BUT THIS ONE I WANT YOU TO DO 
EASTLEIGH IS A DANGEROUS NAIROBI SUBURB WHERE RADICAL ISLAM HAS TAKEN HOLD 
THE KENYAN POLICE WARNED STEVE AND HIS TWO COLLEAGUES 
THAT THEIR FACES WOULD STICK OUT A MILE 
SO THEY TRAVELLED IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK 
THEY FOUND THE STRANGER THEY WERE LOOKING FOR IN HIS ROOM AT A HOTEL 
WHAT THE KENYANS TELL US 
THEY SAID HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY IDENTIFICATION ON HIM 
BUT HE HAS OVER I THINK IT WAS OVER EIGHT HUNDRED U. S. DOLLARS 
ALL IN ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS 
AND HE HAD A CASUALTY RECORD CARD AND IT BASICALLY SHOWED 
THAT THIS PERSON WAS TREATED AT THE M. P. SHAH HOSPITAL IN NAIROBI 
AND THERE WAS A STAMP ON IT AUGUST SEVENTH 
THE MAN WAS ARRESTED AND PUT IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK WITH GAUDIN 
NOW I COULD TELL THE PERSON WAS VERY NERVOUS 
MIGHT NOT HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS GOING ON 
AND I CAN REMEMBER PUTTING MY HAND ON HIS KNEE GOING 
DON'T WORRY WE'RE GONNA GET TO THE BOTTOM EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE O. K. 
AND HE COULD UNDERSTAND ME HE'S LIKE O. K. O. K. 
AND I HAD SOME BUTTERSCOTCH CANDIES IN MY POCKET FOR MYSELF 
AND I WAS LIKE WOULD YOU LIKE SOME CANDY 
AND HE ATE IT AND THEN WE GOT BACK TO THE OFFICE TO START THE QUESTIONING 
NAIROBI'S HOSPITALS WERE STRUGGLING TO TREAT THOUSANDS OF SURVIVORS 
AMBASSADOR BUSHNELL WENT TO VISIT THE INJURED 
I REMEMBER HER HOLDING MY HAND AND TELLING ME 
THAT THEY WERE GONNA TAKE CARE OF ME AND THEY WOULD MAKE SURE 
THAT EVERYTHING WAS O. K. AND THAT I WAS GONNA BE O. K. 
I THINK SHE WAS CRYING AND YOU KNOW I'M THINKING TO MYSELF 
YOU KNOW WHILE SHE'S TELLING ME THIS I'M THINKING TO MYSELF 
I WONDER IF I'M REALLY BAD 
IF SHE'S CRYING I WONDER IF I'M REALLY REALLY BAD 
BECAUSE I DIDN'T FEEL THAT BAD 
I WAS NOT ASHAMED OF WEEPING 
I DID LEARN HOWEVER WHAT I CALL LEADERSHIP WEEPING 
A LEADER IS ALLOWED TO HAVE TEARS COME DOWN 
A LEADER CANNOT BURST INTO TEARS AND HOWL 
SO THE FACT THAT I WEPT 
GOOD HEAVENS I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TEARS I SHED 
BUT I ONLY HOWLED AT HOME AND IN THE SHOWER 
I WOULD WAKE UP EVERY MORNING TOOK A SHOWER 
AND WOULD FORCE MYSELF TO CRY 
SO THAT I COULD GET THROUGH ANOTHER DAY WITHOUT BREAKING DOWN 
UNDER QUESTIONING THE SUSPECT TOLD GAUDIN HIS NAME WAS SALEH 
ON THE DAY OF THE BOMBING HE SAID HE'D BEEN TO A BANK NEAR THE EMBASSY 
AND WAS INJURED IN THE EXPLOSION 
IF YOU LOOKED AT THE PERSON IT WAS A PRETTY LOGICAL STORY 
BUT THERE WERE LITTLE PIECES OF IT THAT WE STARTED TO UNRAVEL 
WE KIND OF HAVE A SAYING IT'S JDLR IN LAW ENFORCEMENT 
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS THAT JUST DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT 
GAUDIN STARTED TO SCRUTINISE THE SUSPECT'S STORY 
SALEH CLAIMED HE WAS WEARING THE SAME CLOTHES 
AS ON THE DAY OF THE BOMBING 
BUT GAUDIN THOUGHT THEY LOOKED BRAND NEW 
HE WAS HAVING NONE OF IT 
YOU END UP IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM THAT IS SO OVERWHELMED 
AND YOU DON'T GET ANY BLOOD ON YOU 
EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE STITCHES HERE ON YOUR FOREHEAD ON YOUR BACK 
I SAID BUT I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THE LOGICAL OUT 
THAT YOU HAVE THE MAGIC SOLUTION IN YOUR HOTEL ROOM 
THAT WILL WASH OUT ANY BLOOD OUT OF ANY CLOTHES HE SAYS YES 
HE GOES I'M A VERY CLEAN PERSON 
AND I WASH MY CLOTHES EVERY NIGHT BEFORE I GO TO BED 
AND THAT'S WHEN THE LIGHTS REALLY STARTED FLASHING 
NOT THAT HE'S A BOMBER NOT THAT HE'S A TERRORIST 
BUT THIS GUY'S LYING 
AND IF YOU'RE LYING ABOUT SOMETHING AS SILLY AS CLOTHES 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE HIDING BUT YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING 
I DID NOT HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH THAT WOMAN MISS LEWKINSKY 
IN AMERICA THE IMPACT OF THE EMBASSY BOMBINGS 
WAS OVERSHADOWED BY SCANDAL IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
THE LEWINSKY AFFAIR MESMERISED AMERICA 
MANY WONDERED IF THE PRESIDENT HAD LOST THE PLOT 
DID YOU SEE ANY CHANGE IN HIM 
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT HE WAS UNDER A LOT OF STRESS AT THAT TIME 
BUT HE WAS VERY CLEAR IN HIS COMMUNICATIONS 
WITH EVERYONE WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THIS 
THAT WE WERE NOT TO WORRY ABOUT THE POLITICS 
THIS WAS A NATIONAL SECURITY MATTER AND THAT WAS ALL THAT COUNTED 
AND I. I BELIEVE THAT 
THE FACT THAT BIN LADEN HAD ALREADY CARRIED OUT HIS THREAT TO ATTACK AMERICA 
WAS LOST IN THE MORAL FRENZY THAT ERUPTED 
OVER THE SCANDAL IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
IRONICALLY IT SEEMED TO PROVE THAT ALL THAT 
BIN LADEN HAD BEEN SAYING ABOUT THE MORAL DECADENCE OF AMERICA WAS TRUE 
LEWINSKY WAS DESTINED TO BECOME 
MERELY A SALACIOUS FOOTNOTE TO HISTORY 
BIN LADEN WAS THE REAL THING HISTORY ITSELF 
THIRTEEN DAYS AFTER THE BOMBINGS 
PRESIDENT CLINTON FINALLY GAVE THE GO AHEAD FOR RETALIATION 
ON AUGUST TWENTIETH CRUISE MISSILES HIT BIN LADEN'S TRAINING CAMPS IN AFGHANISTAN 
BIN LADEN LOOKED AT THAT AND HE SAYS H. M. M. 
I WOULD ASSUME HE SAYS H. M. M. FORTY TWO CRUISE MISSILES 
IS THAT THE BEST THEY CAN DO FOR TWO U. S. EMBASSIES SIMULTANEOUSLY BOMBED 
THEY WENT AFTER ME AND THE TRAINING CAMPS 
ARE THEY GOING TO INVADE NO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING 
CAN WE TAKE FORTY TWO CRUISE MISSILES IN EMPTY TRAINING CAMPS 
SURE WE CAN LET'S KEEP GOING BECAUSE THE U. S. IS A PAPER TIGER 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS 
AND IN HINDSIGHT WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
BACK IN NAIROBI TEN DAYS AFTER HIS ARREST 
SALEH WAS STILL STICKING TO HIS STORY 
GAUDIN SUSPECTED HE'D BEEN TRAINED TO RESIST INTERROGATION 
AND I CAN REMEMBER SAYING 
O. K. ENOUGH 
LET'S HAVE A LEGITIMATE CONVERSATION HERE 
I SAID I THINK YOU'RE EMPLOYING COUNTER INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES 
AND YOU'RE NOT FOLLOWING YOUR TRAINING BECAUSE 
IN YOUR TRAINING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO STICK WITH THE LOGICAL LIE 
AS LONG AS THE LIE IS LOGICAL PEOPLE HAVE NO REASON TO DOUBT IT 
AND INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT ME LIKE I HAD TWO HEADS 
I CAN REMEMBER FOR SURE HE GRABBED THE CENTRE OF HIS CHAIR 
AND HE SCOOTED CLOSER TO ME AND HE GOES WHERE WAS I ILLOGICAL 
AND AT THAT POINT ONE KNEW WE HAD A CHESS GAME GOING 
AND I KNEW I HAD A SECRET MOVE THAT I WAS GONNA BEAT HIM ON 
GAUDIN WAS STILL CONVINCED THAT SALEH'S CLAIM TO BE WEARING 
THE SAME CLOTHES AS ON THE DAY OF THE BOMBING WAS A LIE 
AND WHAT I DID WAS I STOOD UP AND I TOOK OFF MY BELT 
I SAID LOOK THIS BELT IS YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS EIGHT MONTHS OLD 
AND I OPENED UP MY BELT UNHOOKED IT AND OPENED IT UP AND I SAID 
LOOK YOU CAN SEE CREASE MARKS YOU CAN SEE SWEAT MARKS 
NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR OF A BELT 
I SAID LOOK AT YOUR BELT LOOK HOW NEW IT IS 
AND HE STARTS TO PLAY WITH HIS BELT BUCKLE AND THAT'S WHEN I JUST PUT MY HAND ON THE TABLE 
YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT OF AUTHORITY AND I SAID STAND UP 
AND IT WAS THE WAY HE STOOD UP 
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A PRIVATE IN BASIC TRAINING 
HE JUST POPPED TO ATTENTION 
AND I SAID NOW TAKE OFF YOUR BELT 
AND HE UNDID HIS BELT 
AND AS THE BELT BUCKLE FLEW OVER TO THE LEFT 
THERE WAS A PRICE TAG ON THE INSIDE OF THE BELT 
AND I SAID YOUR BELT IS BRAND NEW 
I KNOW YOU'RE LYING 
AND HE LOOKED AT THAT AND HE REALISED THAT HE HAD BEEN CAUGHT 
EVERYTHING I HAD SAID WAS TRUE 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TELL A LOGICAL LIE AND YOU SCREWED UP 
AND HE JUST SAT BACK DOWN 
AND HE LOOKED AT US AND GOES YOU GUYS ARE GOOD AND I NEED TO PRAY 
WHEN YOU ARE IN AN ATTACK 
THE PERPETRATORS OF THE ATTACK ARE LIKE GHOSTS 
THEY GET BLOWN UP WITH THE BOMB 
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO IT IS 
BUT ONE OF THE FIRST EMOTIONS THAT GOES THROUGH YOUR MIND ARE ANGER 
YOU ARE VERY ANGRY AT WHOEVER WOULD CAUSE THIS MUCH SUFFERING AND DEATH AND DESTRUCTION 
RUBBLE ROSE TO ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE FEET IN THIS AREA 
THIS IS DIRECTLY IN THE BACK OF THE BOMB BLAST 
THIS IS THE MOST DEVASTATED PART 
OF THE ENTIRE BUILDING 
LEE REED WENT BACK TO FILM THE DESTRUCTION 
HE REVISITED THE OFFICE WHERE HE'D FOUND MOSES KINYUA 
THE FOREIGN SERVICE NATIONAL OR FSN WHO WORKED AS A DRIVER 
WE RECOVERED AN FSN IN THIS AREA 
UNDER ABOUT THREE FOOT OF RUBBLE WHO SURVIVED 
MOSES SURVIVED THIS ATTACK AND WE DUG HIM OUT ALIVE THE FIRST DAY 
MOSES KINYUA SUFFERED SEVERE HEAD INJURIES AND LOST AN EYE 
A DECADE LATER HE'S STILL RECEIVING MEDICAL TREATMENT 
HOW DID THEY RECONSTRUCT YOUR FACE 
THE RECONSTRUCITON OF MY FACE WAS 
WAS AN IMPLANT ALONG THIS SIDE UP TO THIS PART 
WHICH WAS BROKEN COMPLETELY 
AND I LOST THE BONE AND THE EYE ON THE SIDE OF THE BOMBING 
THIS SIDE OF THE JAWS WERE SUPPORTED BY BARS 
WHICH WERE REMOVED LATER 
I COULDN'T AS WELL CONTINUE WITH MY LIFE 
LIKE I USED TO 
BECAUSE I COULDN'T WORK 
THE VISION WAS GONE 
I COULDN'T THINK MUCH 
I COULDN'T LIFT ANYTHING 
AND IT WAS A BIT DIFFICULT FOR ME 
SITTING DOWN DOING NOTHING AND I USED TO WORK BEFORE 
WHAT WERE YOUR INJURIES 
I WAS MAJOR INJURY IN THE HEAD 
I HAD GLASS WHICH ENTERED HERE VERY DEEP 
AND IT REMAINED A BIT DEEPER INSIDE 
WHAT IT GAVE ME WAS HEADACHES AND CONFUSION 
I LOST TOUCH 
WITH THE WORLD 
AS SALEH WAS BEING INTERROGATED STEVE GAUDIN'S COLLEAGUES 
WERE TRACING HIS PHONE CALLS TO AN EMPTY HOUSE IN A SUBURB OF NAIROBI 
THE FORENSIC TEAM TOLD HIM THE HOUSE LIT UP LIKE CHRISTMAS TREE 
THERE WERE TRACES OF EXPLOSIVES EVERYWHERE 
GAUDIN NOW CONFRONTED SALEH WITH ALL THE NEW EVIDENCE 
I SAID THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY NOW I WANT YOU TO ANSWER ME 
WHY DID ALL THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO BE KILLED 
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF WHETHER YOU'RE INVOLVED OR NOT YOU'RE INVOLVED 
AND HE LOOKED AT IT ALL AND HE SAYS 
WELL THE UNITED STATES IS MY ENEMY NOT KENYA 
AND IF YOU GUARANTEE ME THAT I WILL STAND TRIAL IN THE UNITED STATES 
I WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT MY INVOLVEMENT WITH OSAMA BIN LADEN 
AND MY INVOLVEMENT WITH AL QAEDA 
I HAD NEVER HEARD THE WORD AL QAEDA UNTIL THIS PARTICULAR DAY 
SALEH FINALLY COUGHED 
HE TOLD GAUDIN HIS REAL NAME WAS MOHAMMAD AL OWHALI 
AND HE'D BEEN ONE OF THE TWO SUICIDE BOMBERS 
ACCORDING TO THE PLAN HE WAS TO FORCE OPEN THE EMBASSY GATES AT GUNPOINT THAT MORNING 
BUT IT ALL STARTED TO GO WRONG 
WHEN THE GUARD REFUSED TO OPEN THE GATES 
HE REALISED HE'D LEFT HIS GUN ON THE PASSENGER SEAT 
SO HE REACHED FOR HIS GRENADES 
AND RAN AWAY AT THE LAST MOMENT 
JIHAD ALI THE DRIVER WENT AHEAD AND DETONATED THE BOMB 
AL OWHALI TOLD STEVE GAUDIN 
HE'D PERSONALLY ASKED BIN LADEN TO ENTRUST HIM WITH A SUICIDE MISSION 
DO YOU THINK HE JUST GOT COLD FEET AT THE LAST MINUTE 
I'VE OFTEN HEARD HIM DESCRIBED BY OTHER PEOPLE WHO READ THESE REPORTS AS 
OH THAT'S THE GUY WHO RAN AWAY 
YOU KNOW THAT'S THE COWARD SO TO SPEAK 
AND I'M LIKE IF THIS GUY WAS A COWARD HE HAD YEARS 
TO GET OUT OF BEING IN THE BOMB TRUCK ON THAT DAY 
HE HAD PLENTY OF TIME NOT TO BE IN A POSITION 
WHERE HE WOULD HAVE TO BE ABLE TO RUN AT THE LAST SECOND 
ACCORDING TO HIM WHAT HE EXPLAINS 
MARTYRDOM IS ACHIEVED BY DYING WHILE YOU'RE COMPLETING YOUR OBJECTIVE 
AND HE SAYS HE HAD COMPLETED HIS OBJECTIVE SO TO STAY AND DIE AT THIS POINT 
IS NOT MARTYRDOM IT'S ACTUALLY SUICIDE WHICH IS PROHIBITED 
I WAS FINE FOR MARTYRDOM BUT NOT FOR SUICIDE AND SO HE RUNS 
YOU KNOW WHAT ON THAT DAY HE GAVE HIMSELF AN OPTION 
THAT HE DIDN'T GIVE ANY OF THE KENYANS OR THE AMERICANS 
WHO WERE KILLED THAT DAY THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE 
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED THAT DAY DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION THAT HE GAVE HIMSELF 
ON TWENTY SIXTH AUGUST THREE WEEKS AFTER THE BOMBING 
STEVE GAUDIN ESCORTED MOHAMMED AL OWHALI BACK TO THE UNITED STATES 
IN MAY TWO THOUSAND ONE FOUR MONTHS BEFORE NINE ELEVEN 
HE WAS FOUND GUILTY AND IMPRISONED FOR LIFE 
DID YOU LIKE HIM 
YOU KNOW IT'S A REALLY DIFFICULT QUESTION 
I DON'T HAVE ANY LOVE FOR THE GUY OBVIOUSLY 
HE KILLED ALL THESE INNOCENT PEOPLE 
BUT I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH HIM AND I NEEDED TO DIVORCE MYSELF 
FROM ANY PERSONAL FEELINGS WHILE I WAS INTERVIEWING HIM 
YOU KNOW THERE'S AN OLD SAYING 
DON'T JUDGE AN INDIAN UNTIL YOU'VE WALKED A MILE IN HIS MOCCASINS 
WELL DURING THIS TIME THAT I WAS INTERVIEWING HIM 
THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING WALKING IN HIS STEPS 
FOR AS MUCH TIME AS WE SPENT TALKING ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THE BOMBING 
WE TALKED EVERYTHING ABOUT LIFE MY LIFE HIS LIFE 
SO IT WAS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR YOU 
IT WAS A LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCE FOR ME 
LIKE MANY SURVIVORS OF TERROR 
NAOMI KERONGO'S WOUNDS ARE BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL 
SHE HAS LOST HER JOB HER HOME ALL HOPE 
WE ARE LIVING A LIFE 
THAT IS NEITHER DEAD NOR ALIVE 
WHAT IS YOUR WISH 
I WISH SOMEBODY ON PLANET EARTH 
CAN GIVE BACK MY LIFE 
GIVE ME BACK MY LIFE THAT I CAN BE ABLE TO LIVE 
LIKE A HUMAN BEING 
AND MY FAMILY TOGETHER HAVE A MEAL 
SPEAK TALK CONTINUE OUR LIVES UP TO THE TIME 
THAT GOD WANTS TO SEPARATE US MAYBE IN DEATH OR ANYTHING ELSE 
BECAUSE EVERY DAY IS A NIGHTMARE TO ME 
I WENT THROUGH 
THIRTY ONE EYE SURGERIES 
AND NOT ONE OF 'EM WAS LESS THAN SIX HOURS 
SOME OF 'EM WERE TWENTY TWO HOURS SOME OF 'EM WERE EIGHTEEN HOURS 
I MEAN THEY WERE HORRIFIC SURGERIES 
AND I HAD TO FACE THE FACT THAT I AM BLIND 
AND IT WAS HORRIBLE 
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF DEAR GOD WHY DO I HAVE TO BE THIS WAY 
A MEMORIAL GARDEN HAS BEEN PLANTED ON THE GROUND WHERE ONCE THE EMBASSY STOOD 
IT'S DEDICATED TO ALL VICTIMS OF THE ATTACK 
WE HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING OF THAT SCOPE AND MAGNITUDE 
AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS DONE SIMULTANEOUSLY IN TWO COUNTRIES 
AFTER SOMEBODY SAT IN FRONT OF A TELEVISION CAMERA AND ESSENTIALLY SAID 
YOU ARE FAIR GAME AND I'M GOING TO COME AND GET YOU 
IT WAS A WHACK UPSIDE THE HEAD A MESSAGE 
THAT WE CHOSE NOT TO LISTEN TO 
BECAUSE WE WERE TONE DEAF TO TERRORISM AT THE TIME 
THE STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN AUGUST NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT 
AND THAT BRIGHT SEPTEMBER MORNING THREE YEARS LATER 
IS ANOTHER CATALOGUE OF MISSED OPPORTUNITIES AND INTELLIGENCE BLUNDERS 
THE BOMBING OF THE NAIROBI EMBASSY WAS OSAMA BIN LADEN'S FIRST ACT OF WAR ON THE WEST 
NINE ELEVEN WAS THE FULL FRONTAL ASSAULT 
AMERICA'S RESPONSE IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ 
HAS RADICALISED MANY MORE YOUNG MUSLIMS 
SOME PREPARED TO ESCALATE BIN LADEN'S WAR 
AND PERPETUATE HIS LEGACY 
ULTIMATELY THE GREATEST THREAT 
WOULD BE THE ACQUISITION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION 
BY THE QAEDA ORGANISATION BY ONE OF ITS MERGER GROUPS 
OR BY ANY OTHER TERRORIST GROUP FOR THAT MATTER 
OSAMA BIN LADEN HAS MADE TARGETS OF US ALL 
MADRID 
BALI 
LONDON 
INDISCRIMINATE 
NO MERCY 
BIN LADEN'S SIGNATURE IN THE AGE OF TERROR 
YOUR TOWN 
YOUR STREET YOUR HOME 
IT'S ALL IN OUR DATABASE 
NEW TECHNOLOGY MEANS IT'S EASY TO PAY YOUR T. V. LICENCE 
AND IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE IF YOU DON'T
