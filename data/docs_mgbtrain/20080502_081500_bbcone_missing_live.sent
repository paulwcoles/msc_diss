SEPTEMBER THANKS TO YOUR CALLS 
THIS WEEK THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL 
NEW LEADS ANDREW'S DAD WAS IN 
LONDON ON WEDNESDAY FOLLOWING THEM 
UP 
MY BROTHER MIKE AND I HAVE JUST 
BEEN INTO THE PARKS POLICE 
DEPARTMENT TO CHECK THAT IT'S O. K. TO 
GO AROUND SOME OF THE BUILDINGS IN 
AND AROUND THE PARK AND ASK IF THEY 
WERE HAPPY TO DISPLAY POSTERS FOR 
US TO GET ANDREW'S PICTURE AND 
FACE OUT THERE A LITTLE BIT MORE 
THAT IS ALL WE ARE AIMING TO DO 
GET A LOT MORE PEOPLE AWARE AND 
POSSIBLY OPENING THEIR EYES IN AN 
AREA WHERE HE MAY HAVE BEEN SEEN 
RECENTLY MY SON ANDREW HAS BEEN 
MISSING FROM OUR HOME NOW FOR SEVEN 
MONTHS PEOPLE HAVE E. MAILED IN 
SAYING THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN HIM 
AROUND THE PARK AREA WE WERE JUST 
WONDERING IF YOU MIGHT TAKE A 
POSTER OR TWO AND POP THEM UP 
MY SON ANDREW HAS BEEN MISSING FOR 
SEVERAL MONTHS NOW FROM OUR HOME 
THEY HAVE TAKEN SOME POSTERS TO PUT 
UP ON THEIR NOTICE BOARDS AND THEY 
PROMISED TO PRAY FOR US AS WELL 
THAT IS MARVELLOUS WHATEVER 
DENOMINATION OR RELIGION YOU ARE 
PEOPLE REALLY IDENTIFY WITH 
SOMETHING LIKE A MISSING CHILD 
IT'S EVERY PARENT'S WORSE NIGHTMARE 
EVERYONE'S HEART GOES OUT TO YOU 
YOU GET THAT KIND OF RESPONSE IT 
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU BELIEVE OR 
DON'T BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE THERE 
ROOTING FOR YOU IT'S SUCH A 
SUPPORT IT REALLY IS ENCOURAGING 
PEOPLE THINK THEY HAVE SEEN HIM IN 
AND AROUND THE REGENT'S PARK AREA 
POSSIBLY SLEEPING ROUGH OR 
SOMETHING 
PEOPLE ARE KEEPING ON SOMETHING EYE OUT FOR HIM THEY ARE MORE 
AWARE OF IT THE MORE PEOPLE THE 
BETTER HOPEFULLY ONE DAY WE WILL 
BE REUNITED MAY IT BE SOON 
KEVIN WILL BE WITH US NEXT WEEK IF 
YOU THINK YOU KNOW ANY MORE ABOUT 
WHERE ANDREW MIGHT BE PLEASE CALL 
MISSING PEOPLE MORNING TO YOU 
AGAIN KATE AND GERRY WE WERE JUST 
WATCHING THAT FILM THERE IT'S KIND 
OF A DESPERATE SITUATION THERE HE 
IS A DAD LOOKING FOR HIS SON WHAT 
ARE YOUR FEELINGS WATCHING THAT 
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THE 
EMOTIONS AND THE WORDS ARE THE SAME 
IN TERMS OF IT IS EVERY PARENT'S 
WORSE NIGHTMARE ANY PARENT KNOWS 
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LOSE A CHILD EVEN 
MOMENTARILY AND THERE IS THIS 
HORRIBLE FEAR AND HELPLESSNESS 
OBVIOUSLY IN THE SITUATION IF THAT 
CHILD ISN'T FOUND VERY QUICKLY IT 
JUST DETERIORATES IT REALLY IS A 
LIVING NIGHTMARE 
ALSO ONE OF THE 
PROBLEMS HE HAS HAD IS GETTING 
PUBLICITY MADELEINE HAS CAUGHT THE 
IMAGINATION OF THE WHOLE WORLD 
WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE TO OTHER 
PARENTS WHO ARE IN A SIMILAR 
SITUATION AND DESPERATELY NEED THAT 
PUBLICITY PUBLICITY CLEARLY PROGRAMMES LIKE THIS ARE 
GOOD WE THE MEDIA AGENDA IS NOT 
SET BY US SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO 
KNOW WHY THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH 
FOCUS WE BELIEVE THAT MADELEINE 
HAS BECOME ALMOST ICONIC WE ARE 
VERY PLEASED THAT THE WHOLE ISSUE 
OF MISSING CHILDREN AND MISSING 
PEOPLE IS HIGHER UP THE AGENDA A 
LOT OF THE INFORMATION WE LOOKED AT 
WAS THROUGH CHARITIES THE NATIONAL 
CENTRE FOR MISSING CHILDREN 
MISSING PEOPLE ABOUT GETTING 
POSTERS OUT THERE AND TAKING THE 
OPPORTUNITIES THE FACT HAVING 
VISIBILITY DOES HELP RECOVER 
MISSING KIDS IS REALLY IMPORTANT 
KATE ON A PRACTICAL SENSE WE KNOW 
THERE ARE POSSIBLE SIGHTINGS OF 
MADELEINE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THOSE 
COME THROUGH WHAT SORT OF IN A 
PRACTICAL SENSE HAPPENS 
IT DEPENDS 
WHERE THEY ARE REPORTED IDEALLY 
YOU NEED THOSE SIGHTINGS REPORTED 
TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENTS OR THE N. G. O. S. 
RATHER THAN IT GETTING TO THE MEDIA 
FIRST SOMEONE NEEDS TO ACT ON IT 
IF A CHILD HAS BEEN TAKEN YOU 
DON'T WANT TO ALERT THE PERSON THAT 
YOU ARE ON TO IT YOU NEED PEOPLE 
TO MOVE IN 
PARTICULARLY IN YOUR CASE I 
IMAGINE AS SOON AS THERE IS A 
SIGHTING THE MEDIA ARE STRAIGHT 
AFTER IT WHICH IN SOME WAYS IS NOT 
HELPFUL 
IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE HELPFUL ACTUALLY UNTIL THERE IS AN 
ASSESSMENT AND IF IT WAS A REAL 
JEAN YUN SIGHTING WITH CREDIBILITY 
GENUINE SIGHTING THERE HAS TO BE AN 
ASSESSMENT AND HOW THEY CAN BE 
APPROACHED THERE IS UPSIDES AND 
DOWN SIDES TO THE HUGE MEDIA 
COVERAGE CLEARLY THERE HAS BEEN A 
HUGE AMOUNT OF IRRESPONSIBLE MEDIA 
COVERAGE OF MADELEINE'S CASE WHICH 
HAS BEEN DETRIMENTAL 
WE HAD CALLS 
INTO THIS PROGRAMME ABOUT ANDREW 
AND THAT IS WHY HIS DAD CAME DOWN 
HERE WHEN THERE ARE SIGHTINGS 
THAT MUST BE A DIFFICULT SITUATION 
AS WELL BECAUSE IT BRINGS YOU HOPE 
DOES IT 
IT DOES THINK THERE HAVE BEEN SO 
MANY SIGHTS WITH MADELEINE'S CASE 
WE HAVE KIND OF I SUPPOSE WE HAVE 
MANAGED NOT TO GET TOO HOPEFUL 
IT'S A BIT OF A SELF PROTECTION 
THING REALLY THERE HAVE BEEN CASES 
YOU THINK IT'S UNLIKELY IT'S 
UNLIKELY YOU DO HAVE THAT BIT OF 
HOPE I SUPPOSE IT COMES BACK TO THE 
CREDIBILITY OF THE SIGHTING IF YOU 
WENT ON EVERY SIGHTING MADELEINE 
COULD HAVE BEEN IN COUNTRIES WE 
TRY TO STAY FLAT UNTIL SOMEONE SAY 
THIS ISS A CREDIBLE SIGHTING HERE 
IS A PHOTO OR C. C. T. V. SO FAR WE 
HAVEN'T GOT THAT WE HAVE HAD 
PHOTOGRAPHS AND C. C. T. V. WENT THROUGH 
AND WHEN WE HAVE SEEN THEM SAID IT 
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HER 
IF YOU CAN 
HELP IN THE SEARCH FOR MADELEINE 
THERE IS A NEW NUMBER YOU CAN CALL 
WE WOULD LIKE YOUR THOUGHTS TOO

IT'S BEEN TWELVE MONTHS SINCE MADELEINE 
MCCANN DISAPPEARED THE FAMILY OF 
KATRICE LEE HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR 
THEIR DAUGHTER FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS 
IT'S NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE THE LEE FAMILY LIVE ON A 
BRITISH MILITARY BASE IN THE GERMAN 
TOWN OF PADERBORN THEIR YOUNGEST 
DAUGHTER KATRICE IS ABOUT TO 
CELEBRATE HER SECOND BIRTH DAY HER 
MUM TAKES HER TO THE SUPERMARKET TO 
BUY PARTY FOOD 
AS I GOT TO THE 
CHECKOUT I REMEMBERED I HAD 
FOREGOTTON CRISPS SO I PLACED 
KATRICE ON THE FLOOR AND SAID TO MY 
SISTER I WILL LEAVE HER HERE WITH 
YOU AND GO BACK AND GET SOME CRISPS 
IT WASN'T THAT FAR AS I GOT BACK 
TO THE CHECKOUT I SAID TO MY SISTER 
WHERE'S KATRICE AND SHE SAID SHE 
RAN AFTER YOU WHEN YOU WENT TO GET 
THE CRISPS 
A MASSIVE SEARCH BEGINS 
THE MILITARY POLICE TAKE OVER BUT 
THERE IS NO SIGN OF THE LITTLE GIRL 
THE POLICE BELIEVE THAT MY DAUGHTER 
HAD WANDERED OUT OF A PACKED 
SUPERMARKET THROUGH A DOOR THAT 
DIDN'T OPEN ALONG A PACKED 
CORRIDOR DOWN A RAMP ACROSS A CAR 
PARK OVER A HEDGE AND FALLEN IN 
THE RIVER THAT WAS VERY MUCH THE 
THEORY THAT WAS TAKEN ON BOARD BY 
THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES I I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT SHES WAS 
REMOVED FROM THE PREMISES AND 
ABDUCTED 
TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AFTER SHE ABDUCTED DISAPPEARED HER FAMILY HAVEN'T 
GIVEN UP HOPE OF SEEING KATRICE 
AGAIN 
THIS IS THE LATEST AGAIN PROJECTION OF WHAT KATRICE WOULD 
LOOK LIKE THIS IS MY DAUGHTER L. 
CAN'T HOLD HER L. CAN ONLY LOOK AT HER THAT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT 
WHEREVER KATRICE IS IN THE WORLD 
AND I DO BELIEVE THAT SHE IS STILL 
IN THIS WORLD I HOPE SHE'S HAD A 
HAPPY LIFE REALLY THAT'S ALL I 
CAN ASK FOR I SUPPOSE NATASHA NATASHA KATRICE'S OLDER SISTER IS HERE

RAPID IN THE WAY HE DECIDED AND HE 
MADE APPOINTMENTS THAT HE DIDN'T

REMEMBER GOING INTO HIS BEDROOM 
UPSTAIRS AND HE LOOKED AT ME WITH 
HUNTED EYES HE REVEALED HE HADN'T 
SLEPT A WINK FOR FIVE NIGHTS IN A 
ROW THAT IS VERY ACUTE IT WAS NOW 
FAIRLY CLEAR THAT HE WAS NOT TOO 
FIT 
ALAN'S ARRANGE TO DO MEET A FIT FRIEND FOR A DRINK BUT HE SEEMS 
VERY DOWN 
THAT POINT IT WAS A BIT 
CLEAR HE WAS A LITTLE BIT I DON'T 
KNOW OUT OF SORTS THROUGHOUT THE 
NIGHT HE WAS PRETTY QUIET 
NOTICEABLE TOWARDS THE END THAT HE 
WAS DRAWING BACK AND DRAWING BACK 
THAT NIGHT ALAN GOES BACK TO THE 
FLAT HE SHARES WITH HIS FRIEND BOBY 
WHEN I WOKE UP IN THE MORNING ALAN 
WAS AWAKE AND WE DECIDED TO GO TO 
THE SHOPS TO GET SOMETHING TO HAVE 
FOR BREAKFAST L. WENT ROUND QUITE 
QUICKLY AND WENT AND PAID FOR IT L. 
LOOKED ROUND TO SEE WHERE ALAN WAS 
AND HE WAS WANDERING UP UP AND DOWN 
DOWN THE AISLES BEING A BIT 
DISTANT IT WAS A BIT STRANGE 
EVENTUALLY HE CAME OUT AND HE 
HADN'T BOUGHT ANYTHING HE SAID 
I'M JUST GOING TO GO TO MY FRIEND 
NEIL'S AND GET SOMETHING THERE 
BUT ALAN DOESN'T GO BACK TO THE 
FLAT BY THE END OF THAT DAY HE IS 
REPORTED MISSING POLICE POLICE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT ALAN 
WAS IN THE BAR IN DALKEITH ROAD IN 
EDINBURGH AT TWO THIRTY P. M. AN INQUIRY 
HASN'T SHOWN WHY HE WAS THERE BUT 
WE KNOW HE WAS IN THAT BAR THAT IS 
THE LAST KNOWN POSITION WE CAN HAVE 
OF HIM 
BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF 
UNCONFIRMED SIGHTINGS REPORTED 
ACROSS SCOTLAND THE MOST CREDIBLE 
HAPPENS FIVE MONTHS AFTER ALAN'S 
DISAPPEARANCE OUTSIDE A BAR WHERE 
HE USED TO WORK 
THE STAFF AT HALO 
BAR IN EDINBURGH HAD LOOKED OUT 
THROUGH THE GLASS FRONTED WINDOW 
AND SAW A MALE STANDING OUTSIDE ON 
THE PAVEMENT AND ONE OF THE 
BARMAIDS THOUGHT IT WAS ALAN HER 
AND THE BAR MANAGER RAN OUTSIDE AND 
HAD A LOOK BUT BY THIS TIME THE 
FIGURE HAD START TO DO WALK AWAY 
UNFORTUNATELY THEY DIDN'T CALL HIM 
OR SHOUT HIS NAME THEY WERE FAIRLY 
CONVINCED IT COULD BE ALAN HOWEVER 
AGAIN THAT'S UNCONFIRMED AND WE 
HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO TRACE THAT 
PERSON 
IT'S NOW EIGHTEEN MONTHS SINCE PERSON ALAN DISAPPEARED EVERY NIGHT HIS 
FAMILY LIGHT A CANDLE FOR HIM I I MISS I'M A GREAT BULK OF A BODY TO 
CLUTCH MEETING HIM OFF THE TRAIN 
WITH TWO RUCKSACKS OR MORE THERE THERE WAS A SENSE OF LIFE ABOUT HIM JUST 
A VERY POSITIVE ENJOYMENT OF LIFE 
IT'S VERY EMPTY WITHOUT THAT THERE 
AND NOT KNOWING IF YOU ARE GOING TO 
I. T. V. AGAIN 
HAVE IT AGAIN 
SOMEONE SOMEWHERE MUST KNOW 
SOMETHING ABOUT ALAN IF YOU THINK 
YOU DO PLEASE CALL MISSING PEOPLE 
OH FIVE OH OH SEVEN HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED WE ARE JOINED BY 
ALAN'S MUM AND DAD WHO HAVE COME 
DOWN FROM SCOTLAND THANK YOU HOW 
ARE YOU DOING

SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT MAKES THE 
SENSE OF LOSS FLARE UP AN 
ANNIVERSARY OR A LETTER COMING IN 
FOR HIM WE'RE HUGELY SUPPORTED BY 
LOTS OF FOLK BUT IT STILL SEEMS AT 
TIME NOT REAL 
WHAT ABOUT THE 
SEARCH DOUGLAS DO YOU DO ANYTHING 
YOU'VES 
NOT AT THE MOMENT IT'S YOU'VES JUST A QUESTION OF WAITING THAT 
TAKES QUITE A LOT OF PATIENCE I I THINK THE POLICE TO BEGIN WITH 
HAD SO MANY THINGS THEY COULD DO 
SO MANY FRIENDS THEY COULD GET IN 
TOUCH WITH AND FOLLOW UP WITH AND 
KIRSTEN AND CALUM DID POSTERS AND A 
BLOG THE HARDEST THING HAS BEEN 
SINCE THE END OF LAST YEAR HAVING 
THE SENSE FROM THE POLICE THAT THEY 
FEEL THERE ARE JUST NOTHING MORE 
THAN THEY CAN THINK OF DOING IT IS 
STILL AN OPEN CASE 
HOPEFULLY CALLS 
TO THIS PROGRAMME COULD HELP YOU 
THAT'S RIGHT THAT IS WHY IT SEEMS 
TO US MARVELLOUS THERE IS THIS 
OPPORTUNITY FOR WIRED PUBLICITY

FOR HIS GOING 
WE DO THINK LOOKING 
BACK ON IT HE 
HAD COME 
BACK FROM 
FRANCE MORE DEPRESSED THAN WE HAD 
REALISED FOR LONGER THAN HE HAD 
REALISED SO HE WAS PROBABLY COPING 
WITH MORE THAN HE WAS SAYING MAYBE 
THAT WAS TO PROTECT US NOT WANT TO 
GO WORRY US BUT OF COURSE YOU SAY 
TO YOU'VE COULD WE HAVE SPOTTED 
THE SIGNS EARLIER BUT I THINK WE 
COULDN'T REALLY BECAUSE HE DIDN'T 
WANT IT OUT FRONT UNTIL HE JUST 
COULDN'T COACH WITH IT ANY LONGER

HIS PASSPORT HAD GONE 
TWO MONTHS LATER THERE IS A LEAD 
ONE HUNDRED MILES AWAY AT HEATHROW AIRPORT 
I GOT A CALL FROM THE POLICE SAYING 
GOOD NEW BAD NEWS GOOD NEWS IS WE 
HAVE FOUND SEAN THE BAD NEWS IS 
THERE IS ONE THOUSAND IN PARKING FINES L. 
CONVINCED MYSELF THIS WAS WHERE I 
WAS GOING TO FIND A LETTER OR NOTE 
OR SOMETHING SO WE HOUNDED DOWN TO 
HEATHROW DAD AND I THERE WAS NO 
NOTE IN THE CAR NOTHING BUT WHAT 
WAS VERY STRANGE IS THERE WAS ABOUT 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY IN BAGS OF STRANGE HERE WAS A 
MAN WITH NOT VERY MUCH MONEY AND 
HERE WAS ALL OF THIS CHANGE L. 
COULDN'T EQUATE THAT AT ALL IT WAS 
SO SAD STATE OF MIND WAS HE IN 
THE SEARCH NOW SPREADS ACROSS 
EUROPE 
CERTAINLY ALL THE EUROPE INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS HAVE BEEN 
LOOKED AT AND OF COURSE WE WORKED 
CLOSELY WITH INTERPOL AND OTHER 
AGENCIES THE INFERENCE THE CAR WAS 
FOUND AT HEATHROW AIRPORT SO THERE 
IS A SUGGESTION HE HAS GONE OF HIS 
OWN ACREDITED 
AS IT'S TWO MONTHS 
SINCE SEAN HAS GONE MISSING IT'S 
NOT POSSIBLE TO TRACK THE FLIGHT 
RECORDS THERE IS NO FURTHER LEADS 
IN THE SEARCH A YEAR LATER IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR 
THERE IS A POTENTIAL SIGHTING IN 
GREECE ON THE ISLAND OF CRETE I I DID TRY TO GET A FLIGHT L. AM 
POTLESS AT THIS TIME I WOULD HAVE 
BEGGED BORROWED OR STOLEN IT THE THE ORGANISATION MISSING PEOPLE OFFERS 
TO HELP THEY HAVE CONTACTS IN 
CRETE WEEKS LATER GLENIS RECEIVES 
SOME PHOTOS 
I DID THINK IT WAS SEAN I ASKED 
EVERYBODY ELSE THEY SAID IT COULD 
BE SEAN WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN STONE THIS 
CHAP WAS PROBABLY ABOUT TWELVE AND A 
HALF IT'S LIKELY HE WOULD HAVE 
LOST WEIGHT HE LOOKED DEPRESSED 
AND DEJECTED 
BEFORE GLENIS IS ABLE 
TO GET THE MONEY TO FLY TO CRETE 
SHE HAS TOLD THE MAN THOUGHT TO BE 
HER HUSBAND HAS DISAPPEARED IT IT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST REGRETS OF

A SUPERMARK NET GERMANY L. KNOW YOU 
ARE CAMPAIGNING FOR A SYSTEM THAT 
WOULD BE CALLED CHILD RESCUE ALERT 
WHAT WOULD IT DO 
THE FIRST THING 
WE ARE SAYING IT'S A SYSTEM ACROSS 
THE U. S. CALLED AMBER ALERT IT'S 
USED IN CHILD ABDUCTION CASES THE 
IDEA IS THAT ONCE LAW ENFORCEMENT 
HAVE ASSESSED THE SITUATION THEY 
PUT OUT A DESCRIPTION OF THE CHILD 
ABDUCTOR IF KNOWN VEHICLE CAR 
REGISTRATION ALL THE BROADCAST 
PROGRAMMES ARE INTERRUPTED WITH 
THAT INFORMATION IT GOES OUT ON T. V. 
RADIO THERE ARE WIRELESS NETWORKS 
S. M. S. MULTIMEDIA SERVICES 
BILLBOARDS MOTORWAY SIGNS IT'S 
BEEN AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM IN THE U. S. A. 
A LOT OF CHILDREN HAVE BEEN 
RECOVERED HOW MANY IS IT 
THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE 
AND QUICKLY RECOVERED AS WELL THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE THE MAJORITY ARE ABOUT EIGHTY PER CENT IN THE 
FIRST THREE DAYS 
DO YOU THINK IF 
THERE WAS A SYSTEM LIKE THAT HERE 
IT WOULD HAVE MADE ANY DIFFERENCE 
TO MADELEINE AND HOW QUICKLY SHE 
WAS FOUND 
IN PORTUGAL IT'S 
DIFFICULT TO SAY NO ONE WILL EVER 
BE AUBL TO SAY L. BELIEVE IT WOULD 
HAVE INCREASED THE CHANCES OF 
RECOVERING MADELEINE L. THINK THE DIFFICULTY 
PRESUMABLY WITH DIFFICULTY KATRICE IT'S THE CROSS BORDER THING 
THAT BECOMES IMPORTANT THAT'S THAT'S WHERE IT IS WE NEED AN INTEGRATED 
SYSTEM PARTICULARLY SMALL 
COUNTRIES PORTUGAL BELGIUM THE 
NETHERLANDS IF YOUR CHILD IS 
ABDUCTED CLOSE TO A BORDER IT'S 
QUITE LIKELY WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S 
POSSIBLE THAT MADELEINE WAS MOVED 
OUT OF PORTUGAL QUICKLY IN SO YOU 
NEED A SYSTEM THAT IS COMBINED WE 
WOULD IDEALLY WANT AN ALERT BY THE 
TIME THE ALERT GOES OUT BY THE 
TIME IT'S BEEN ASSESSED YOU ARE 
PROBABLY LOOKING AT A MINIMUM OF NINETY 
MINUTES AND ANYTHING TWO OR THREE 
FOUR HOURS YOU NEED THAT SYSTEM TO 
GO OUT IN SPAIN YOU WANT PORTS 
ALERTED AIRPORTS TRAIN STATIONS 
MARINAS 
I KNOW YOU WILL BE HERE MARINAS LATER I ALSO KNOW YOU HAVE A NEW 
E. MAIL ADDRESS YOU WILL GIVE TO 
VIEWERS WHICH IS ANONYMOUS
