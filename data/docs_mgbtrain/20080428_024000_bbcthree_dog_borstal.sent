INJI AND BERTIE ARE A COUPLE OF CHANCERS FROM SOUTH LONDON 
BLOODY HELL BERTIE THEY ALWAYS TRY AND PUSH THEIR LUCK 
BIG BOY WOODY IS ADDICTED TO LOVE 
OTHER DOGGIES DON'T LIKE THAT WOODY HE'S A SEX MANIAC OF A DOG 
THE OWNERS OF THESE BAD DOGS HAVE HAD ENOUGH 
IT'S TIME FOR EXTREME MEASURES 
THIS IS THE LAST RESORT FOR BAD DOGS 
SET UP ON A SECURE TEN ACRE COMPOUND IN A REMOTE PART 
OF THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE DOG BORSTAL IS RUN BY THREE OF BRITAIN'S TOUGHEST TRAINERS 
MY MISSION IS TO TEACH OWNERS TO TEACH DOGS WHO'S BOSS 
EACH TRAINER WILL TAKE ON ONE INMATE IN AN ATTEMPT TO REFORM THEM 
IN JUST FOUR DAYS USING THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL TRAINING METHODS 
THEY COME HERE WITH NO TACTICS NO SKILL NO KNOWLEDGE 
THAT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE 
BUT TO REFORM BAD DOGS THEY NEED TO TACKLE THEIR OWNERS 
FOR THESE FOUR DOGS FREEDOM AND BAD BEHAVIOUR ARE ABOUT TO COME TO AN END 
OUR FIRST OFFENDERS ARE A TERRIBLE TWOSOME 
THEY'RE AFFECTING ALL AREAS OF MY LIFE 
MANCHESTER TERRIER INJI AND JACK RUSSELL BERTIE SHARE A GAFF IN SOUTH LONDON 
I THINK THEY KNOW HOW TO WIND ME UP AND THEY'RE GETTING VERY GOOD AT IT 
SINCE MOVING IN TOGETHER MONTHS AGO THIS DIRTY DUO HAVE PERFECTED THE ART OF DOGS BEHAVING BADLY 
AND THE ONLY THING DISRUPTING THEIR BACHELOR IDYLL IS OWNER HUGO 
I'M STILL THE SUCKER PROVIDING THE ROOF THE FOOD THE BEDDING 
AT BEST I'M PART OF THE GANG 
INDOORS IT IS INJI WHO IS KING OF SIN 
INJI SEEMS TO USE HIS POOS IN THE SAME WAY THAT A DOG OR CAT USES PEE 
HE'LL DO A BIT HERE HE'LL DO A BIT THERE IT'S AN ART FORM 
THEY CRAMP HUGO'S STYLE INDOORS AND RUN AMOK OUTDOORS 
WE FLY OUT OF THE HOUSE 
WE DON'T REALLY GO WALKING WHERE BERTIE SHOWS HIS TRUE COLOURS 
WE NEED AN EXORCIST OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME LUCIFER IN THERE 
BERTIE COME ON 
COME ON BERTIE 
AND THESE HALF PINT HOODLUMS LIKE TO ACT LIKE THEY'RE THE TOUGHEST ON THE BLOCK 
IT'S NOT JUST A MANIC MOVING FORWARDS OR SIDEWAYS OR BACKWARDS 
INJI 
IT'S AS THOUGH MY ROUTE IS COMPLETELY UNIMPORTANT 
THE PAIR TREAT HUGO LIKE A HAPLESS SIDEKICK 
EVEN IF IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING QUITE WELL AT SOME POINT HE'S GOT 
TO BE THE NOISIEST AND LOUDEST BERTIE 
THEY NEED DIRECTION AND THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO TRY AND PUSH THEIR LUCK 
BUT THEIR LUCK HAS RUN OUT 
THEY'RE BEING SENT DOWN TO DOG BORSTAL 
THEIR TRAINER WILL BE ROBERT ALLEYNE 
HE SPECIALISES IN DOG BEHAVIOUR AND HAS OVER TWENTY YEARS' EXPERIENCE 
HI DOGS BARK 
SHOOSH WARM RECEPTION 
SO WE NEED TO WORK A LITTLE BIT ON GETTING OUT OF THE CAR 
HI I'M HUGO NICE TO MEET YOU I'M ROB HI ROB 
YOU'RE WELL PREPARED I SEE 
UM I THOUGHT I HAD TO BRING FOOD AND ALL THE TREATS AND TOYS 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I SAID YOU'VE BROUGHT IT WITH YOU 
BUT HUGO HAS FORGOTTEN INJI AND BERTIE'S VACCINATION CERTIFICATES 
WITHOUT VACCINATION PAPERS INJI AND BERTIE WILL HAVE TO DO THEIR STINT IN ISOLATION RIGHT YOU TWO 
LOOK AFTER EACH OTHER AND THE HOUSE THE LONGER YOU STAY AT THE DOOR THE MORE WOUND UP THEY GET 
WHILE THE DOGS GET USED TO THEIR KENNEL 
OWNER HUGO CAN AND UNPACK AND SETTLE IN TO HIS ARMY TENT ACCOMMODATION 
I WORRY HUGO MIGHT BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HOPES IT'LL JUST HAPPEN 
I'D DO THE WORK FOR HIM AND HE CAN GO BACK TO SLEEP 
THAT AIN'T GOING TO HAPPEN 
THE NEXT CANINE OFFENDER HEADING FOR BORSTAL IS IN A LEAGUE OF HIS OWN 
GET DOWN GET DOWN OFF THERE 
MEET WOODY AND FORMER MODEL MICHELLE 
THEY TURN HEADS BUT FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS 
I SEE YOU BABY SHAKING THAT ASS 
HE CONSTANTLY SEEMS HORNY 
I CAN PULL HIM AWAY BUT HE KEEPS CONSTANT ALL THE TIME 
I FEEL ANXIOUS 
WOODY DOES WHAT HE WANTS TO DO AND ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS 
I FEEL GOOD 
WOODY'S HUMPED MY MUM NOT VERY NICE IS IT 
MY DAD HE'S HUMPED MY DAUGHTER ALICIA HER BOYFRIEND LEE 
HE'S HUMPED MY NEPHEW GARETH 
HE'S HUMPED MY SISTER DIANE 
HE'S HUMPED MY TWO YOUNG NEPHEWS AARON AND CONNOR 
AND ALSO HE'S QUITE PARTIAL TO HUMPING MY CATS SAMMY AND GIZMO 
HE'S A SEX MANIAC OF A DOG 
ANYBODY THAT COMES TO THE HOUSE HE WILL HUMP 
IF THE POSTMAN COMES HE'S SCRATCHING MY LAMINATE 
WHEN RANDY WOODY DOESN'T GET WHAT HE WANTS HE CAN TURN NASTY DO AS YOU'RE TOLD COME ON IN THERE 
GET IN THERE I'M FRIGHTENED IF I GET HOLD OF HIM HE'LL GO FOR ME 
IT'S LIKE HE HATES ME ONE OF THESE DAYS HE'S GOING TO GIVE HER A SERIOUS BITE 
SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE STITCHES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE LEFT FOR WOODY 
I DO LOVE THE DOG BUT I'VE GOT TO PROTECT MY FAMILY AS WELL 
HE'S BEING SENT DOWN TO DOG BORSTAL 
WOODY AND MICHELLE WILL BE UNDER THE STRICT SUPERVISION OF BORSTAL'S TOUGHEST TRAINER 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HE DOES TEND TO WANT TO HUMP A MAN MORE THAN A WOMAN 
THERE'S NO CHANCE THE DOG IS GOING TO HAVE A GO AT ME MALE TO MALE BONDING ISN'T MY THING 
EH EH EH 
HE LIVES IN A NORMAL URBAN AREA THERE'LL ALWAYS BE A BITCH SO HE'LL BE IN A PERMANENT STATE OF AROUSAL 
HIS WHOLE LIFE WITH NOWHERE FOR IT TO GO 
HOW CRUEL IS THAT IT'S TIME FOR WOODY TO LEARN HIS PROPER POSITION 
NUMBER TWO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WHICH IS TO THE RIGHT 
DON'T MAKE A BIG THING ABOUT LEAVING 
PLAYTIME IS OVER FOR WOODY AND OWNER MICHELLE 
I GET THE FEELING IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE HARD WORK 
I CAN TELL THAT JUST BY BEING HERE AN HOUR 
INJI BERTIE AND WOODY ARE ALL SERVING TIME AT BORSTAL 
INJI AND BERTI HAVE BEEN SENT DOWN FOR BEHAVING LIKE A COUPLE OF THUGS 
BUT IT'S OWNER HUGO WHO MIGHT BE THE HARDEST TO HANDLE I DON'T HAVE THE EASIEST OWNER 
WOODY IS INSIDE FOR RANDY AND DISRESPECTFUL BEHAVIOUR 
BUT HOW WILL OWNER MICHELLE DEAL WITH TRAINER MIC'S HOME TRUTHS 
JUST BORING 
MOVE YOUR ARSE IT IS GOING TO BE A TOUGH WEEK 
AND NOT EVERYONE WILL HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO GRADUATE 
AT BORSTAL THE DAY STARTS EARLY 
WOODY AND OWNER MICHELLE ARE FIRST OUT ON THE TRAINING FIELD DOG OUT 
WHY HAVE YOU WAITED THIS LONG 
YOU'RE SAYING TODAY YOU HAVE GROWLED AT ME 
YOU'VE TRIED TO HUMP ANDY YOU'VE HAD A GO AT MY DAUGHTER 
YOU HAVE BIT HER YOU HAVE YOUR DINNER ANYWAY 
MIC'S FIRST TASK IS TO GET WOODY TO BE SUBMISSIVE TO OWNER MICHELLE WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS 
WE ARE DOING A MALE MOUNTING POSITION ON HIM 
THIS SAYS YOU'RE IN CHARGE RIGHT I AM DOING IT TO YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIVE YEARS 
NEVER SEEN THAT I THOUGHT WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE 
WITH THE WRONG HANDLING THIS DOG COULD KICK OFF 
HE HAS GOT AN OUTWARD IMPRESSION OF BEING A PONCEY DOG BUT I'VE SEEN POODLES REALLY KICK OFF 
GROOMING IS GOING TO BE A REAL BIG THING 
BUT IT WILL TAKE MORE THAN ONE GROOMING SESSION TO MAKE WOODY'S OWNER DOMINANT 
MICHELLE HAS TO LEARN HOW TO CONTROL HIM ON THE LEAD 
THE DOG IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO BREAK 
BECAUSE HE'S HAD FIVE YEARS OF DOING WHATEVER IT WANTS 
SO NOW WHEN YOU ASK IT TO DO THE SIMPLEST OF TASKS LAY DOWN IT IS A DIFFICULT THING TO DO 
BUT ONCE YOU HAVE DONE IT A FEW TIMES IT WILL REALISE THAT RESISTANCE IS FUTILE AS THEY SAY 
WOODY IS DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN PHYSICAL DOMINANCE OVER HIS OWNER 
SO SHE WILL HAVE TO PERSEVERE TO GET HIM DOWN TO HIS RIGHTFUL POSITION 
I WANT TO STAND ABOVE YOU WE HAVE GOT ALL DAY 
SIT AND IT MAY WELL TAKE ALL DAY 
SIT BRING HIS ARSE ROUND 
THAT'S IT THAT'S IT LEFT RIGHT ON THE DOUBLE AND THEN UP 
DO IT AGAIN THE BIG STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE HANDLER IS GOT TO BE HONEST NOT A NATURAL 
HOLD THE COLLAR DOWN 
JUST KEEP YOUR FOOT THERE 
DOWN SWING HIS ARSE ROUND 
THE MORE WILFUL HE GETS THE MORE FORCEFUL MICHELLE NEEDS TO BE 
IN THAT BIT THERE BRING IT ROUND 
GO ON THE CLOSER YOUR FOOT IS TO THAT LEATHER BIT 
SLIDE THAT ONE ALONG THAT IS A NICE COMFORTABLE POSITION WOODY 
THERE YOU GO 
NOW JUST RELAX 
YOU JUST WON YOUR FIRST FIGHT BY THE WAY 
OVER ON ROBERT'S FIELD HE'S WAITING FOR INJI TO ARRIVE 
WITH OWNER HUGO FOR THEIR FIRST ASSESSMENT 
BUT HUGO IS RUNNING LATE 
BERTIE WE'LL SEE YOU IN HALF AN HOUR 
COME ON 
AND HE HAS FORGOTTEN HIS POO BAGS 
COME ON THIS WAY 
THE OWNER'S JUST HEADED OFF TO MIC'S FIELD 
SOMETIME BETWEEN THE TIME I TOLD HIM MY FIELD WAS OVER HERE AND NOW OH HE'S COMING BACK 
I HAVE GONE TO COMPLETELY THE WRONG FIELD SORRY I JUST HAD IT IN MY MIND'S EYE THAT THAT WAS THE ONE 
SORRY I DON'T WANT TO BE LATE 
BACK HOME INJI WAS GUILTY OF TOILETING IN INAPPROPRIATE PLACES 
INJI CRAPPED ALL OVER THE FLAT 
AND HE KICKED OUT AT ANY ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL HIM 
INJI INJI 
FOR OWNER HUGO TO GET THE UPPER HAND IT'S BACK TO BASICS 
COME ON GOOD BOY COME ON 
WHEN HE'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE LET HIM KNOW USE YOUR VOICE TO ENCOURAGE HIM 
I CAN'T HEAR YOU NOT PULLING AT THE MOMENT 
HUGO HAS TO LEARN TO KEEP INJI'S ATTENTION BY USING TREATS AND PRAISE 
AS A REWARD FOR GOOD BEHAVIOUR 
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD HIM HE IS A GOOD BOY YET GOOD BOY INJI WALKING BRILLIANTLY 
YOU KNOW WHERE ALL OF THE FOOD'S KEPT NOW DON'T YOU 
I DO NEED HIM TO STOP RABBITING TO HIS DOG ALL THE TIME 
MIGHT FALL INTO A RABBIT HOLE IF YOU KEEP LOOKING AT MY HAND 
INJI'S GONE FROM A DOG THAT PULLED TEN MINUTES AGO TO A DOG THAT IS WALKING NICELY 
HUGO IS A LITTLE SLOWER TO CATCH UP 
WE'LL GET THERE NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU STOP AND YOU TELL HIM HE IS A GOOD BOY 
BUT YOU ALWAYS DO ABOUT THREE SENTENCES ABOUT IT 
BLAH BLAH BLAH I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I AM JUST A DOG 
I AM QUITE LUCKY BECAUSE I THINK I HAVE THE EASIEST DOGS 
BUT I DON'T HAVE THE EASIEST OWNER 
IT'S JACK RUSSELL BERTIE'S TURN TO BE ASSESSED BUT HE'S NOT GOING EASILY 
BACK HOME HE WAS ALWAYS SPOILING FOR A FIGHT 
BUT CAN HE BE TEMPERED AS QUICKLY AS HIS PARTNER IN CRIME INJI 
COME ON BERTIE 
BERTIE ROUND 
HE'S A HANDFUL 
BERTIE'S A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BALLGAME FROM INJI 
BERTIE HAS A MUCH HIGHER PREY DRIVE 
HE SMELLS ALL THESE RABBITS AND THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN OUT HERE AND WANTS TO FIND THEM 
HE'S OBSESSED WITH THE SQUIRRELS AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS 
HUGO IS GOING TO HAVE TO WORK A LOT HARDER 
HE'S DONE EVERYTHING EXCEPT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO YOU 
HE'S LOOKED UP THE FIELD HE'S LOOKED OVER THERE HE'S WHIMPERED HE'S PACED 
BUT HE HASN'T PAID ANY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GONE ON HERE 
BUT BERTIE HAS HIS OWN WAY OF MAKING HUGO TAKE NOTICE OF HIM 
WHEN YOUR DOG'S JUMPING UP YOUR BACK WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE HE'S SAYING 
I THINK WHAT HE'S SAYING HE'S GOING COME ON BASICALLY COME ON 
COME ON BERTIE WOULDN'T DO THAT ME WOULD YOU 
HE JUST BLOODY DID AND YOU WENT OH COME ON BERTIE 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF BORSTAL MIC WANTS TO TEACH WOODY TO COME BACK 
TO OWNER MICHELLE FOR SIMPLE REWARD RATHER THAN SEXUAL GRATIFICATION 
WHEN HE COMES IN I WANT YOU TO GO DOWN ONTO ONE KNEE 
IN A MANLY TYPE STYLE LIKE THIS 
AND GET HIM TO COME BACK TO YOU 
COME COME YOU'RE OFF MATE 
THERE HE GOES O. K. HE'S COMING 
GO DOWN GO DOWN 
COME COME WOODY 
COME COME 
DO YOU REMEMBER THE BIT WHEN I SAID GO DOWN ONTO ONE KNEE 
COME COME WOODY GOOD BOY 
JUST WALK BACK OFF THE LEAD 
COME WOODY 
NORMALLY THE DOG DOESN'T WANT TO BE WITH ME 
TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HE CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK TO THE HANDLER 
WHAT HE'S DOING THERE IS RUNNING BACK TO THE HANDLER AND GOING 
OH IT'S YOU ME YOU'RE SO BORING I'M JUST GONNA GO OFF AND SNIFF SOMETHING 
HE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO RESPECT FOR HER AT ALL 
AT H. Q. ROBERT IS HOPING AN OBEDIENCE SESSION WITH INJI 
WILL HELP OWNER HUGO REBUILD HIS CONFIDENCE 
PRACTISE THAT ON THE SPOT JUST GETTING THIS HEEL SOMEWHERE CLOSE TO THE SIDE OF THIS FOOT 
BRINGING THIS ONE AROUND TO IT AND THEN DOING THE SAME AGAIN 
AND BRINGING THAT ONE ROUND TO IT 
BUT HE'S STRUGGLING TO FIND HIS FEET 
O. K. YOU'VE ENDED UP OVER THERE 
SO AGAIN YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING YOU'RE TAKING TOO BIG STEPS 
TO GIVE INJI A FIGHTING CHANCE OF WALKING TO HEEL 
HIS OWNER MUST LEARN THE IMPORTANCE OF AN ELEGANT MEASURED TURN 
YOU'RE SPINNING ON THE BALLS OF YOUR FEET AND YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY KEEP UP CAN YOU 
RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT 
NOW WE'RE COOKING 
GOOD BOY 
RIGHT TURN WITH ME 
THAT'S O. K. 
KEEP ENCOURAGING HIM AS YOU DO THE TURN SO HE FOLLOWS RIGHT TURN 
ENCOURAGE HIM IN AND ENCOURAGE HIM OUT 
I THOUGHT WE WERE BOTH GOING TO GO INTO THE FENCE TOGETHER 
YOU'LL GO INTO A FENCE IF YOU KEEP WALKING TOO LONG AFTER I TELL YOU TO TURN 
HAVING EARNED HIS STRIPES WALKING TO HEEL TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT INJI CAN DO OFF THE LEAD 
WAIT LEAVE YOUR DOG 
WAIT THE FURTHER YOU GET THE LOUDER I WANT YOU TO BE WAIT 
TURN AND FACE YOUR DOG TELL HIM AGAIN WAIT CALL YOUR DOG 
INJI 
COME ON WHAT'S THIS 
KEEP YOUR HANDS THERE NOW SIT 
GOOD BOY 
BAD DOGS BERTIE INJI AND WOODY ARE SERVING TIME AT BORSTAL 
IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY MUST PASS A TEST TO PROVE THEY ARE REFORMED 
BUT NOT ALL OF THEM WILL MAKE IT 
YOU 
IT'S THE FINAL DAY OF TRAINING 
FIRST TO THE FIELD ARE WOODY AND MICHELLE 
HEEL READY AND NOW GO GO GO GO 
HEEL UP 
WRONG COMMAND THE THING THAT I AM LOOKING AT IS DIVERTING HIS 
ENERGY FROM SEXUAL PURSUITS INTO SPORTING PURSUITS 
COME ON IN COME ON IN 
THE STANDARD POODLE THEY WERE USED AS POLICE DOGS IN FRANCE 
GOOD TRACKING DOG WOULD HAVE DONE A LOT OF AGILITY TRAINING AND WOULD HAVE CLEARED A SIX FOOT WALL 
OUR DOG OLD WOODY CAN'T EVEN GET OVER SIX INCHES 
SO I THINK HIS POLICE CAREER IS DOOMED NOW GO GO SAY IT 
UP 
THAT IS TERRIBLE HER TIMING IS BLOODY AWFUL AT THE MOMENT 
SHE IS NOT REALLY PICKING IT UP 
OVER AT H. Q. TREATS ARE ON THE MENU 
BERTIE DOES WHAT BERTIE WANTS WHEN BERTIE WANTS 
AND THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO FORM A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM 
LEAVE IT 
HUGO SHOUTS AND HUGO YELLS OR HUGO SAYS NOTHING HE GOES FROM ONE EXTREME TO THE OTHER AND I THINK HE 
FRIGHTENS THE LIFE OUT OF HIS DOGS BECAUSE HE JUST BELLOWS AT THEM 
AND I FIND IT INTIMIDATING NEVER MIND HIS DOGS' 
SO I'M GOING TO GET HIM TO USE A RATTLE BOTTLE AND THE RATTLE 
IN HIS SITUATION IS DESIGNED TO BE QUIETER THAN HIS SHOUTING 
I WANT HIM TO INTIMIDATE HIS DOGS LESS AND GET THEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE SAYS WITHOUT SHOUTING 
LEAVE 
DON'T LOOK AT HIM ANY MORE STOP THREATENING HIM 
ONCE YOU MAKE THAT PROLONGED EYE CONTACT YOU ARE THREATENING 
O. K. NOW WATCH THIS JUST TELL HIM TO LEAVE NICE AND CALM 
WITHOUT THE RATTLE WITHOUT THE RATTLE 
LEAVE GOOD BOY 
TELL HIM TO LEAVE LEAVE 
LEAVE IF HIS NOSE IS STAYING OFF THE FLOOR 
OFF YOU GO LOOK HOW HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO NEAR THE CHICKEN 
WE'RE GETTING THERE LEAVE IT 
IN CLASSROOM CONDITIONS THERE HAS BEEN A BREAKTHROUGH 
BUT OUTSIDE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF RABBITS AND BERTIE HAS A PLAN FOR EVERY ONE OF THEM 
NOW HE IS GOING INTO THE FERNS AND THE DOG IS WALKING ALONG OBEDIENTLY BEHIND HIM 
ROB HAS TRUSTED BERTIE TO A LONGER LEAD BUT IT IS HUGO WHO IS LEADING BERTIE ASTRAY 
GOOD BOY WHAT IS HE DOING 
LEAVE IT WHAT IS HE DOING NOW THINGS ARE BEGINNING TO UNRAVEL 
THIS IS THEIR LAST TRAINING SESSION BEFORE THE TEST AND THINGS ARE SIMPLY GOING FROM BAD TO WORSE 
SIT DOWN SIT GOOD BOY SIT 
NO DON'T DO THAT I CALLED HIM HE WAS IN FRONT OF YOU YOU RATTLED HIM AND PUSHED HIM AWAY AGAIN 
SO GO AND PRAISE HIM AND TELL HIM WHAT A GOOD BOY HE IS 
WELL DONE BERTIE 
TRAINER ROBERT'S SEEN ENOUGH 
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU DO A TEST WITH HIM I CAN'T THINK OF A TEST THAT I CAN DO THAT WOULD BE FAIR TO HIM 
I DON'T THINK HE SHOULD BE TESTED SO HE WON'T BE DOING ONE 
BUT BERTIE'S NOT FINISHED YET 
SO WHAT'S THIS DOMINANCE OVER ME O. K. HANG ON 
WHAT WAS YOUR RELEASE COMMAND ZERO 
AND HOW MANY TIMES DID I SAY HAVE A RELEASE COMMAND AT LEAST TWO PROBABLY THREE 
AND YOU NEVER GAVE HIM ONE SO HOW DOES HE KNOW HE CAN GET UP NOW 
YOU'RE TEACHING HIM THE PROBLEM YOU ARE TRYING TO AVOID NOW HE'S CLIMBED 
UP ONTO THE BACK OF YOUR CHAIR SO HE CAN GET TO WHERE THE RABBITS ARE IT IS SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO DO 
SO WHY ARE YOU LETTING HIM DO IT I MIGHT JUST DO IT 
THERE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GET UP ON THE CHAIR SIT 
GOOD BOY 
SORRY I JUST FELT LIKE ROCKING HIS WORLD 
SORRY ROB 
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD KEEP HIM 
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD KEEP HIM I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD KEEP HIM COS I DON'T THINK 
YOU WANT TO HELP HIM ENOUGH FOR HIM TO GET TO WHERE YOU WANT HIM TO BE 
EITHER YOU CHANGE THAT 
OR YOU SHOULD RE HOME HIM 
HUGO IS SUCH A NICE GUY BUT HE'S THE EMBODIMENT OF INCONSISTENCY 
AND I WORRY THAT WITH THE BEST WILL IN THE WORLD ON HIS PART HE WON'T BE CONSISTENT WITH BERTIE 
NOW MOVE YOUR 
OVER ON MIC'S FIELD HE'S DETERMINED THAT 
WOODY AND OWNER MICHELLE WILL FIND THEIR RHYTHM BEFORE TOMORROW'S TEST 
I THINK THE TIMING HAS SORT OF IMPROVED SLIGHTLY FROM BAD TO NOT SO BAD 
THAT'S IT UP 
DON'T HAVE TO KEEP SAYING IT IT'S JUST UP THE FIRST TIME 
NOW HAND OFF KEEP WALKING DO THE WHOLE LOT GO GO 
UP GOOD BOY 
NOW DO IT YOU CAN'T MOTIVATE SOMEONE LIKE THAT THROUGH PUNISHMENT YOU'VE GOT TO MOTIVATE THEM THROUGH REWARD 
BIT LOUDER UP UP 
KEEP WATCHING YOUR DOG DON'T LET HIM BITE THE LEAD 
THROW THE NO COMMAND AS SOON AS HE GETS EXCITED 
THE THING IS WE'VE TAKEN HIM FROM A SEX ADDICT TO A SPORTING ADDICT 
AND IF HE CONTINUES WITH THE AGILITY I THINK HE COULD BE GOOD 
I THINK WITH THE HANDLER HE'S NEVER GONNA 
BE ANY GREAT SHAKES WITH OBEDIENCE BECAUSE HER TIMING'S TOTALLY TO COCK 
IT'S JUST A SHAME THERE'S A DOG OUT THERE LIKE THAT ONE 
THAT WITH A BETTER HANDLER COULD HAVE PROBABLY GONE ALL THE WAY 
IT'S JUDGMENT DAY BIT TIRED BIT NERVOUS 
THE OWNERS JUST HAVE TIME TO GIVE THEIR DOGS ONE LAST WALK BEFORE THE TEST DOG OUT 
BUT OWNER HUGO IS GETTING READY TO FACE A TOUGH ORDEAL 
KENNEL MANAGER DAVE HAS FOUND A NEW HOME FOR BERTIE AT A LOCAL FARM 
IT'S A TOUGH DECISION TO MAKE BUT DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE DOG THERE 
IT'S A HEARTBREAKING DECISION 
AT THE MOMENT DO YOU LOVE BERTIE 
YEAH I LOVE HIM DO YOU LIKE HIM 
HATE HIM WELL THERE YOU GO TO BE HONEST 
THE DECISION TO REHOME HIM HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN LIGHTLY 
AND HUGO MAKES THE MOST OF THEIR LAST MINUTES TOGETHER 
HIS BIGGEST TEST IS TO LET BERTIE GO TODAY 
HEY HUGO HI ROB 
HOW YOU DOING 
HAPPY AND SAD WELL THEY'RE HERE 
READY TO COME AND COLLECT HIM 
SO IF YOU'RE HAPPY I'LL TAKE HIM OVER 
AND GIVE HIM TO THE GUYS YEAH 
YEAH O. K.

WHERE WE BELONG WHERE WE BELONG 
WHERE WE BELONG
