FORCED TO REWRITE THE BUDGET TO 
SAVE THEIR SKINS BUT CAN AN 
EMERGENCY TAX CUT REALLY RESCUE 
THIS PRIME MINISTER 
A MONTH AGO IT WAS OUT OF THE 
QUESTION BUT THAT WAS BEFORE THE 
GOVERNMENT HAD SEEN THE DEPTH OF 
ITS UNPOPULARITY TODAY THE 
CHANCELLOR ATE HIS WORDS AND A LOT 
OF HUMBLE PIE AND TRIED TO UNDO THE 
DAMAGE DONE BY THE GOVERNMENT'S 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE 
AT A COST OF TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION I WILL 
INCREASE THE INDIVIDUAL PERSONAL 
TAX ALLOWANCES BY SIX HUNDRED 
WHAT UTTER 
CYNICISM WHAT TOTAL INCOMPETENCE 
WHAT A COMPLETE HUMILIATION FOR 
THIS CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER 
WE ASKED THE CHANCELLOR IF WE CAN 
EVER AGAIN BELIEVE A WORD HE SAYS 
ALSO TONIGHT THE TRUE COST OF 
CHEAP FASHION WHAT YOUNG BRITISH 
SHOPAHOLICS BOUND WHEN THEY TRIED 
TO SEE WHERE THEIR CLOTHES CAME 
FROM 
HE'S A BABY AND HE GOT FROM BEATEN UP BY A GROWN MAN IT 
JUST MAKES YOU FEEL SICK 
AND HOW A 
COUPLE OF OLD CODGERS WITH A PLANK 
CREATED THE CROP CIRCLES WHICH 
FOOLED BRITAIN'S TOP SPOKES AT 
FIRST SIGHT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S U. F. O. 
FILES SPOOKS 
GOOD EVENING PERHAPS THEY WILL 
RENAME HIM GORDON'S FLEXIBLE FRIEND 
THE TRANSFER OF THE EXCHEQUER'S 
SOLUTION TO THE TROUBLE HIS PARTY 
IS IN IS TO BORROW OR RATHER 
COMMIT ALL OF US TO BORROW A LOT OF 
MONEY THERE WAS NOT MUCH USE OF 
THE WORD PRUDENCE ALASTAIR DARLING 
WAS TRANSPARENTLY TRYING TO BUY HIS 
WAY OUT OF POLITICAL PROBLEMS AND 
LONG GONE WHEN ANY AFFECTATIONS 
THAT HE COULD NOT SUDDENLY BRING IN 
A NEW BUDGET INSTEAD HE DID 
PRECISELY THAT 
MOST MIDDLE AGED BESUITED 
POLITICIANS WOULD JUST LOVE THEIR 
MESSAGE TO REACH THE TO CALL FOR 
SCHOOL CROWD WHO COME TO A PLACE 
LIKE THIS ONE POLICY HAS REACHED 
THIS EXHIBITION OF GRAFFITI ART IN 
LONDON'S WATERLOO WHAT WAS 
SUPPOSED TO BE A MINOR PART OF 
GORDON BROWN'S LAST BUDGET THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE 
IT HAS NOW BECOME EMBLEMATIC OF 
POLITICAL DISILLUSION THE 
CHANCELLOR HAS BEEN UNDER PRESSURE 
TO COMPENSATE THE MILLIONS WHO 
BEEN MADE WORSE OFF TODAY HE 
UNVEILED AN UNPRECEDENTED TAX 
GIVEAWAY 
I AM PROPOSING TO BRING GIVEAWAY FORWARD ONE MEASURE FROM THE PRE 
BUDGET REPORT NOW MR. SPEAKER I 
WANT TO HELP FAMILIES ON LOW AND 
MIDDLE INCOMES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
MY PROPOSAL FOR THIS YEAR WILL NOT 
ONLY HELP THOSE ON LOW INCOMES WHO 
LOST OUT BUT IT ALSO DOES MORE TO 
HELP ALL BASIC RATE TAX PAYING 
FAMILIES AT A TIME WHEN IT OIL AND 
FOOD PRICES HAVE BEEN RISING IN 
EVERY PART OF THE WORLD 
HOW WAS 
THE CHANCELLOR PROPOSING TO HELP 
HAVE LOST OUT THE TAX 
FREE ALLOWANCE FOR EVERYBODY IS 
INCREASING BY SIX HUNDRED TO SIX THOUSAND THIRTY FIVE THAT 
MEANS EVERY BASIC RATE TAX PAYER IS 
BETTER OFF BY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY A YEAR BUT THE 
HELP IS ONLY TARGETED ON BASIC RATE 
TAXPAYERS THE THRESHOLD FOR THE 
UPPER RATE FORTY PER CENT TAX BAND IS DOWN BY 
SIX HUNDRED THAT MEANS UPPER RATE TAX 
PAYERS ARE UNAFFECTED THE 
CONSERVATIVES WHO HAVE BEEN 
CAMPAIGNING ON THE ABOLITION OF THE 
TEN PENCE TAX RATE IN THE CREWE AND 
NANTWICH BY ELECTION ACCUSED THE 
CHANCELLOR OF ONLY OFFERING A SHORT 
TERM SOLUTION 
THIS SOUNDED LESS 
LIKE A CONSIDERED STATEMENT FROM A 
CHANCELLOR AND MORE LIKE A CYNICAL 
PRESS RELEASE IN A BY ELECTION 
CAMPAIGN FIRST WE GOT THE TAX CON 
AND NOW WE ARE GETTING THE 
COMPENSATION CON IT IS CLEAR THIS 
HELP IS FOR ONE YEAR ONLY IT IS A 
ONE OFF PAYMENT A ONE OFF SOLUTION 
TO TAX RISES THAT HIT EVERY SINGLE 
YEAR 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS YEAR WELCOMED THE PLAN BUT WANT THE 
GOVERNMENT TO DO MORE TO LIFT THE 
VERY LOW PAID OUT OF TAX ALTOGETHER 
ALL OF US ARE GOING TO HAVE TO 
FOCUS ON THE ISSUE OF HOW THIS IS 
DONE AND HOW IT IS GOING TO BE PAID 
FOR I HOPE IT IS NOT ANOTHER 
SHORT TERM GIMMICK THE BEGINNING 
OF A PROCESS BY WHICH THE LOW PAID 
ARE PAID LESS TAX 
THE REASON THE 
CHANCELLOR HAS HAD TO REVISIT THIS 
ISSUE SO URGENTLY IS THAT LABOUR 
M. P.'S HAVE BEEN THREATENING A REVOLT 
THE UNOFFICIAL LABOUR LEADER OF 
THE LABOUR DISCONTENT ON THE MATTER 
HAS BEEN FRANK FIELD HE RECENTLY 
BECAME RATHER RUDE ABOUT GORDON 
BROWN SAYING THAT HE SEEMS TO BE 
UNHAPPY IN HIS OWN SKIN TODAY 
FRANK FIELD DECLARED HIMSELF AT 
LEAST HAPPY WITH THE GOVERNMENT 
PLAN 
COULD I HAZARD A GUESS THAT PLAN THE PLEASURE THAT IS BEING 
EXPRESSED ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE 
WILL BE WIDELY EXPRESSED IN THE 
COUNTRY AS WELL MR. SPEAKER AS THE 
PRIME MINISTER IS IN HIS PLACE 
MIGHT I ALSO ADD THAT OVER THE 
WEEKEND I ALLOWED MY CAMPAIGNING TO 
BECOME PERSONAL L. MUCH REGRET THAT 
AND I APOLOGISE WITHOUT RESERVATION 
THIS WAS DESIGNED TO BE A DAY OF 
GOOD NEWS FOR THE GOVERNMENT BUT 
ONE MINISTER CAROLINE FLINT 
INADVERTENTLY PROVIDED SOME BAD 
NEWS ON HER WAY TO BRIEF THE 
CABINET THIS MORNING THE HOUSING 
MINISTER GAVE TANTALISING GLIMPSE 
OF HER SPEAKING NOTES THE FRONT 
PAGE SNAPPED BY A PHOTOGRAPHER 
WITH A LONG LENS IT WAS ENTITLED 
STATE OF THE HOUSING MARKET AND IT 
WARNS OF SIZABLE FALLS IN PRICES 
LATER THIS YEAR AT BEST DOWN FIVE PER CENT TO 
TEN PER CENT YEAR ON YEAR HOUSEBUILDING 
IT GOES ON IS ALSO STALLING NEW 
STARTS ARE ALREADY DOWN TEN PER CENT 
COMPARED TO A YEAR AGO IT 
CONCLUDES WE CAN'T KNOW HOW BAD IT 
WILL GET 
THE TEN PENCE TAX MESS DECK DATES 
BACK TO GORDON BROWN'S LAST BUDGET 
AS CHANCELLOR ONE OF HIS FORMER 
ADVISERS NOW BELIEVES THAT IF HE 
WANTS TO PUT IT BEHIND HIM HE MUST 
BE URGENTLY A VISION OF WHAT HIS 
PREMIERSHIP IS ALL ABOUT OR STAND 
ASIDE AND LET SOMEONE ELSE DID THE 
JOB 
I THINK WE HAD VARIOUS DOG JOB WHISTLE POLICY ISSUES LOTS OF 
MICRO MEDDLING L. DON'T THINK THERE 
IS A BIG PICTURE YET WHAT IS 
FRUSTRATING BECAUSE GORDON BROWN 
IS STEEPED IN THE POLITICS OF 
FAIRNESS OF THE QUALITY OF A KIND 
OF VIEW OF POTENTIALLY WHAT A 
MODERN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC BRITAIN 
COULD LOOK LIKE WE HAVE SEEN IT IN 
SPEECHES OVER THE YEARS IT IS 
THERE WITHIN HIM AND IT NEEDS TO 
COME BACK VERY QUICKLY NOW IF HE IS 
TO SAVE HIS GOVERNMENT AND 
PREMIERSHIP THE WRITING ON THE PREMIERSHIP WALL FOR GORDON BROWN ONE OF THE 
LESSONS OF POLITICAL HISTORY IS 
THAT THE ELECTORATE RARELY GIVE 
GOVERNMENTS THE CREDIT FOR SOLVING 
THE PROBLEM OF VOTERS BLAME THEM 
FOR CAUSING IT IN THE FIRST PLACE 
NO ONE TRIED VERY HARD TO INSULT 
ANYONE TO INTELLIGENCE BY CLAIMING 
TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT WAS ANYTHING 
OTHER THAN A POLITICAL FIX BUT IT 
DOES HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE 
PUBLIC FINANCES AND IT HAPPENED AS 
THERE WAS MORE BAD NEWS ABOUT THE 
STATE OF THE ECONOMY THAT IS PAUL 
MASON'S TERRITORY 
WHAT ALASTAIR DARLING DID TODAY WAS 
MAKE A BIG CHANGE TO TAX ALLOWANCES 
AT BOTH ENDS OF THE SPECTRUM TO 
GIVE MONEY BACK TO THOSE WHO LOST 
OUT BY ABOLISHING THE TEN P. TAX HE 
RAISED THE ATTACK AND THAT ANYONE 
CAN KEEP BEFORE THEY PAY ANY TAX AT 
ALL ALL THE TAX ALLOWANCE FOR EVERYBODY 
RISES BY SIX HUNDRED TO SIX THOUSAND THIRTY FIVE THE POINT AT 
WHICH PEOPLE ON MIDDLE INCOMES 
START PAYING TAX AT FORTY PER CENT THE 
HIGHER RATE WAS BROUGHT DOWN 
AGAIN BY A NET SIX HUNDRED IT KICKS IN AT 
JUST UNDER FORTY ONE THOUSAND THAT BRINGS 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE INTO THE HIGH TAX 
BRACKET BUT IT DOES NOT PAY FOR 
ITSELF ALASTAIR DARLING IS HAVING 
TO BORROW TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION EFFECTIVELY 
THIS WAS A MINI BUDGET 
IF YOU TAKE THE FISCAL RULES THAT 
FACE VALUE THIS GIVEAWAY HAS USED 
UP THE REMAINING ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE 
THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD AT THE TIME 
OF THE BUDGET THE FACT THAT THE 
COSTS MAY GO ON IN YEARS IF HE 
CANNOT CRAWL THIS THAT MAKES IT 
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT IT IS AN 
UNPALATABLE CHOICE BETWEEN SAYING 
GOODBYE TO THE FISCAL RULES OR TO 
CREATE A FRESH SET OF LOSERS AND A 
FRESH SET OF POLITICAL PROBLEMS 
FOR GOVERNMENT AND THE 
DIFFICULTIES IT IS AT THE MOMENT 
IT IS AN UNENVIABLE CHOICE THE THE JUSTIFICATION FOR USING TAX 
ALLOWANCES RATHER THAN 
TICKET HELP IS THAT IT IS SIMPLE 
BUT LOOK AT THE EFFECT TWENTY TWO MILLION 
PEOPLE WOULD BE BETTER OFF BUT 
ONLY FORTY TWO MILLION OF THOSE ACTUALLY 
LOST OUT FROM THE TEN PENCE TAX AND 
ANOTHER ELEVEN MILLION HE DID LOSE OUT 
WILL NOT BE FULLY COMPENSATED IN 
THE END THIS IS A TAX CUT FROM A 
CHANCELLOR WHO SAID THERE WAS NO 
MONEY FOR ONE SO WHAT DOES IT 
TOOK TO HIS CREDIBILITY 
MANY TAX 
REFORMS HAVE WINNERS 
LOSERS 
THE WINNERS ARE USUALLY UNGRATEFUL 
AND THE LOSERS ARE USUALLY VENGEFUL 
WHEN A GOVERNMENT IS WEAK IT FINDS 
IT HARD TO RESIST THE PRESSURE FROM 
THE LOSERS TO COMPENSATE THEM THAT 
HAS HAPPENED OVER CAPITAL GAINS TAX 
IT HAS HAPPENED OVER INCOME TAX 
THAT PUTS THE GOVERNMENT'S 
CREDIBILITY IN SERIOUS QUESTION AND 
MEANS YOU ARE STACKING UP FUTURE 
BILLS TO PAY FOR THE GIVEAWAYS 
TODAY BROUGHT ANOTHER HEADACHE FOR 
ALASTAIR DARLING INFLATION THE 
C. P. I. MEASURE USED BY THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND TO ASSESS INTEREST RATES 
HIT THREE PER CENT THAT WAS A JUMP OF OH FIVE PER CENT IN 
A SINGLE MONTH THIS CHART SHOWS 
THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS THE 
BIGGEST HIKE WAS IN HOUSEHOLD BILLS 
ENERGY ETC FOOD IS UP BREAD 
MEAT FRUIT AND CORNFLAKES ARE ALL 
THE RARE THEN THERE IS ALCOHOL 
CIGARETTES RESTAURANT AND HOTEL 
BILLS THEY ARE ALL DEER THIS IS 
MAINLY BECAUSE ALASTAIR DARLING 
RAISED EXCISE DUTY THE PROBLEM FOR 
POLICY MAKERS IS THAT THE ECONOMY 
IS SLOWING DOWN HOUSE PRICES ARE 
PREDICTED TO FALL FIVE PER CENT TO TEN PER CENT AT 
LEAST TODAY RETAIL SALES ARE ALSO 
DOWN ALL OF THIS LEAVES INTEREST 
RATE POLICY IN BIT OF CORNER 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS IT A 
TERRIBLE DILEMMA AT THE MOMENT ON 
THE ONE HAND IT HAS VERY CLEAR 
SIGNS THAT THE ECONOMY IS SLOWING 
ON THE OTHER DREADFUL INFLATION 
NUMBERS AND WHILE PRICES SUGGESTING 
THERE WILL BE NO LET UP IN THE 
MONTHS AHEAD L. THINK THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND IS IN A DIFFICULT POSITION 
ON BALANCE THEY MAY GO FOR A RATE 
CUT IN JUNE BUT THE ODDS ON THAT 
HAPPENING ARE INCREASING ALL THE 
TIME 
THIS IS A POLITICAL ISSUE AS TIME WELL IT IS ALASTAIR DARLING WHO 
SET THE INFLATION TARGET CRITICS 
OF THAT TARGET SAY IT IS IN DANGER 
OF NEEDLESSLY PUSHING THE ECONOMY 
TOWARDS RECESSION SO IT IS A RARE 
DAY ON WHICH A CHANCELLOR SEES THE 
CREDIBILITY OF BOTH FISCAL POLICY 
AND MONETARY POLICY CALLED INTO 
QUESTION FOR ALASTAIR DARLING IT 
HAS BEEN THAT KIND OF DAY 
PLENTY TO ASK THE CHANCELLOR OF THE 
EXCHEQUER WHEN I WENT TO SEE HIM 
TONIGHT WE MET DOWN AT THE 
TREASURY TREASURY CHANCELLOR ON APRIL TWENTIETH HE SAID 
WHAT I CAN'T DO IS REWRITE THE 
BUDGET IT ISN'T POSSIBLE AS YOU 
GOING TO A FINANCIAL YEAR TO 
UNRAVEL THE WHOLE THING AND ATTEMPT 
TO REWRITE IT THAT WAS WHAT TWENTY FOUR 
DAYS AGO 
WHAT HAPPENED WHAT I 
HAVE DONE IS BRING FORWARD A 
PROPOSAL THAT I WOULD HAVE 
OTHERWISE ANNOUNCED IN THE PRE 
BUDGET REPORT BECAUSE I WANTED TO 
ENSURE THAT PEOPLE GOT THE BENEFIT 
OF THE RISING PERSONAL TAX 
ALLOWANCE THIS SEPTEMBER IF I LEFT 
IT UNTIL NOVEMBER OBVIOUSLY THAT 
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DONE A YOU ARE 
REWRITING THE BUDGET THOUGH I'M 
NOT 
YOU'RE NOT REWRITING THE NOT BUDGET 
I AM NOT THERE IS AN BUDGET ASPECT I THINK IS NECESSARY TO SORT 
OUT THE PROBLEMS FOLLOWING THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN PENCE RATE WE 
MADE A MISTAKE ABOUT THAT AND WE 
NEED TO SORT THAT OUT L. THINK IT 
IS RIGHT THAT WE BRING FORWARD THE 
PROPOSAL I CAN FINANCE AT THIS 
YEAR AND IT IS A PROPOSAL FOR THIS 
YEAR IN THE PRE BUDGET REPORT I 
WILL RETURN TO THIS MATTER TO 
CONCENTRATE OUR HELP ON PEOPLE ON 
LOWER INCOMES FOR THE FOLLOWING 
YEAR 
WHAT WE ARE ANNOUNCING TODAY IS 
SOMETHING THAT HELPS NOT JUST 
PEOPLE WHO LOST OUT AS A RESULT OF 
THE ABOLITION BUT A WIDER RANGE OF 
PEOPLE EARNING UP TO FORTY THOUSAND WHO 
ARE FEELING THE PRESSURE OF 
INCREASED BILLS AND FUEL TAX AND SO 
ON THAT IS SOMETHING I WANTED TO 
DEAL WITH THIS YEAR 
WHO WILL BE 
WORSE OFF AS A CONSEQUENCE OF 
TODAY 
WELL THE ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY TODAY HAS BEEN FINANCED BY INCREASED 
CAN ACCOMMODATE THAT 
BUT WE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT 
YES ALL 
BORROWING IS FINANCED BY THE 
GENERAL TAXPAYER THAT IS TRUE BUT 
BORROWING AND OUR DEBT IS LOWER 
THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST SO I 
CAN ACCOMMODATE THAT THE SEER YOU YOU CANNOT CONTINUE BEYOND THIS YEAR 
WITHOUT RAISING TAXES 
WELL OUR 
OBJECTIVE IS TO KEEP BORROWING AT A 
SUSTAINABLE LEVEL WE HAVE GOT OUR 
FISCAL RULES WHAT I ANNOUNCE TODAY 
WAS A MEASURE THAT I THINK THIS 
YEAR CAN HELP NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO 
LOST OUT AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGES 
WE MADE TO THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE 
BUT ALSO A WIDER RANGE OF PEOPLE 
BECAUSE THIS YEAR THEY ARE FACING 
ADDITIONAL PRESSURES FOR ME TO 
HAVE FINANCED THAT BY TAKING MONEY 
BACK OUT OF THE ECONOMY AND 
INCREASING TAXES ELSEWHERE 
ESPECIALLY AT THIS TIME WHEN OUR 
ECONOMY IS SLOWING DOWN IN COMMON 
WITH ECONOMIES ACROSS THE WORLD 
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WRONG THING TO 
DO THE RIGHT THING TO DO GIVEN 
THAT WE HAD TO SORT OUT THIS 
PROBLEM IT WAS RIGHT TO HELP A 
BROADER RANGE OF PEOPLE AND TO HELP 
FINANCE THAT THROUGH BORROWING THIS 
YEAR 
WHICH WE WILL ALL HAVE TO PAY YEAR FOR AS HE CONCEDED ARE YOU ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
CONFIDENT THAT YOU CAN WITH THIS 
ADDITIONAL BORROWING STAY WITHIN 
THE FORTY PER CENT OF G. D. P. RULE YES 
FOR ONE HUNDRED 
YES PER CENT YES L. L. MADE IT CLEAR WITHIN THE PER CENT HOUSE OF COMMONS THIS AFTERNOON 
THAT I WILL RETURN TO THIS WHEN I 
DO MY PRE BUDGET REPORT IN THE 
AUTUMN I WILL CONCENTRATE ON 
HELPING PEOPLE ON LOWER INCOMES 
BUT I WILL SET OUT WHAT WE INTEND 
TO DO L. MADE IT CLEAR THAT WE WILL 
STICK TO AFTER SCHOOL HAS A A SPECIFICALLY TO DEAL WITH THIS 
APPARENT INJUSTICE YOU WILL HAVE 
TO RAISE TAXES IN OTHER AREAS AT AT THIS STAGE YOU CANNOT MAKE ANY 
JUDGMENT AS TO WHAT WILL BE 
NECESSARY BECAUSE THERE ARE SO 
MANY VARIABLES 
YOU CANNOT MAKE A 
JUDGMENT EVEN AFTER YOU BROUGHT IN 
THE CHANGE APPARENTLY 
I MADE A 
VERY CLEAR JUDGMENT IN RELATION TO 
THE TEN P. THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT 
NEEDED TO GET SORTED OUT AND THAT 
WE COULD NOT JUST LEAVE IT 
FOR BUT 
HE CONCEDED IT WAS A MISTAKE I I SAID WHEN WE REDUCED THE BASIC 
RATE DOWN TO TWENTY PENCE AND GOT RID 
OF THE STARTING RATE ALTHOUGH 
GORDON BROWN ANNOUNCED MEASURES TO 
HELP PEOPLE THROUGH THE TAX CREDITS 
TAKING PEOPLE OUT OF TAX THERE 
WERE OTHERS WHO WERE NOT HELPED AND 
WE NEED TO EAT TO SORT THAT OUT L. 
SAID THAT AND PEOPLE WIDELY 
EXPECTED US TO COME FORWARD AND DO 
THAT IT'S THEIR RIGHT EXPECTED 
THAT I HAVE DONE THAT 
BUT IT IS 
NOT JUST THE ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. 
RATE OF TAX IT IS NOT JUST THE 
IDEA ABOUT INHERITANCE TAX IT IS 
NOT JUST CHANGING THE RULES ABOUT 
WHAT YOU REQUIRE OUR NONDA MISSILES 
WE HAVE NOT CHANGED THEM AT ALL NONE DOMICILED NONE DOMICILED WERE YOU ALSO CLAIM YOU HAVE NOT 
CHANGED THE RULES ON CAPITAL GAINS 
TAX 
WE DID CHANGE THE RULES IN TAX RELATION TO CAPITAL GAINS TAX WE 
WANTED TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES 
BUT THESE ARE MISTAKES YOU KEEP 
MAKING 
WE DID NOT CHANGE IN MAKING RELATION TO THE NON DE MISSILES AT 
ALL IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET IT 
RIGHT 
SHAW PREFERABLY FIRST TIME RIGHT IN RELATION TO CAPITAL GAINS TAX 
HAVING A SINGLE RATE IS THE RIGHT 
THING TO DO 
BUT YES WE NEEDED TO 
DO MORE TO HELP BUSINESSES AND I 
MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR HAVING DONE 
THAT WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT IF 
ANY GOVERNMENT MAKES ANY MISTAKE 
IT OUGHT TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY 
IT'S O. K. THAT WAS NOT RIGHT WE 
NEED TO FIX IT 
BUT YOU KEEP MAKING 
THESE MISTAKES AT A TIME WHEN THE 
ECONOMY CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE A 
CHANCELLOR WHO KEEPS MAKING 
MISTAKES 
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS MISTAKES HAPPENED IN RUSSIA IT IN RELATION 
TO OUR ECONOMY GENERALLY IT HAS 
CONTINUED TO GROW ALL OUTSIDE 
COMMENTATORS BELIEVE IT WILL 
CONTINUE TO GROW WE INTERVENED 
AFTER NORTHERN ROCK TO ENSURE THE 
STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM BOTH THOSE 
OBJECTIVES WERE ACHIEVED AND 
NORTHERN ROCK IS BEGINNING TO PAY 
BACK THE MONEY IT GOT FROM THE BANK 
OF ENGLAND IN RELATION TO THE 
ECONOMY GENERALLY IT IS RIGHT AT 
THIS TIME TO SUPPORT WHAT IS 
HAPPENING NOT JUST FOR PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE LOST OUT BUT A WIDER RANGE OF 
PEOPLE AS WELL 
THIS MESS THAT YOU 
FIND YOURSELF IN TODAY IS THE 
DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF GORDON 
BROWN'S LAST BUDGET ISN'T IT 
FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT HE IS NOT FIT 
FOR THE JOB OF PRIME MINISTER 
NONSENSE WHAT GORDON WAS DOING AND 
THE CHANGES HE MADE WERE SIMPLY TWO 
RATES OF TAX WITH A NEW STARTING 
RATE OF TWENTY P. INEVITABLY WHEN YOU 
MAKE CHANGES TO THE TAX SYSTEM 
THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES IN RELATION 
TO THE REMOVAL OF THE TEN PENCE RATE 
WE NEEDED TO DO MORE AND WE ARE 
DOING MORE IT IS BETTER THAT WHEN 
YOU HAVE THESE PROBLEMS AND I WAS 
ASKED ABOUT THEM LAST AUTUMN AND AT 
NORWICH THERE WERE PROBLEMS WE 
NEEDED TO DO MORE WE UNDERSTAND 
THAT AND ARE DOING MORE BUT WHEN 
YOU ASK A QUESTION LIKE THAT YOU 
JUDGE US ON OUR ECONOMIC 
PERFORMANCE OF THE LAST TEN YEARS 
OUR PERFORMANCE AS AN ECONOMY IS 
MUCH STRONGER THAN COMPARABLE 
COUNTRIES WE STILL HAVE VERY 
STRONG EMPLOYMENT RATES MANY 
SECTORS IN OUR ECONOMY ARE DOING 
WELL AND THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES FOR 
THE SUCCESS OF OUR ECONOMIC 
MANAGEMENT YES WE ARE GOING 
THROUGH DIFFICULT TIME NOW IN 
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TERMS BUT 
WE HAVE THE STRENGTH TO GET THROUGH 
THIS GORDON BROWN I ALL OF US 
HAVE HAVE IT IS UNIVERSALLY AGREED THAT ONE 
OF THE REASONS PEOPLE HAVE FELT 
PROSPEROUS THE LAST FEW YEARS IS 
THAT THE COST OF THINGS LIKE 
CLOTHES HAVE BEEN DRIVEN DOWN AND 
DOWN THE REASON YOU CAN BUY CHEAP 
T. SHIRTS IS BECAUSE OF WHERE AND 
HOW THEY ARE MADE BUT WHAT WOULD 
HAPPEN IF YOUNG PEOPLE WITH THE 
PASSION FOR FASHION DISCOVERED HOW 
THEIR CLOTHES WERE MADE THAT WAS 
THE IDEA BEHIND BLOOD SWEAT AND T. 
SHIRTS A B. B. C. THREE SERIES WHICH 
FINISHED TONIGHT SIX FASHION 
FANATICS WERE MADE TO PICK COTTON 
WORK IN FACTORIES IN DELHI AND WON 
BY AND FOR THE MOST PART LIVE LIKE 
INDIAN WORKERS ON THE WAGES THEY 
MANAGED TO MAKE TWO OF THE 
PARTICIPANTS WILL BE TELLING THE 
BRITISH RETAIL CONSORTIUM HAVE THEY 
CHANGED THEIR MINDS SHORTLY 
THE LUCKY SIX WHO AGREE TO THE 
MONTH LONG WIFE SWAP INCLUDE THE 
FASHION STORE A STUDENT AMRITA 
SINGH 
IT DOES NOT AFFECT ME IF IT SINGH HAS BEEN MADE BY A THREE YEAR OLD 
OR A FIFTY YEAR OLD 
ASPIRING FASHION 
DESIGNER TARA SCOTT 
YOU CAN KNOW 
THAT SOMETHING IS GOING ON BUT IF 
YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT IT IS ALMOST 
LIKE IS IT REAL 
AND SHOP 
ASSISTANT STACEY DOOLEY 
I DO NOT 
GIVE IT ANY THOUGHT IT IS SO FAR 
AWAY I DO NOT THINK 
IN WEEK ONE 
THE SIX OF THEM WERE EASED INTO 
THEIR NEW LIVES BY WORKING AT ONE 
OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS EXPORT 
CLOTHING FACTORIES IN DELHI SHY HE 
SUPPLIES ONE OF THE BIGGEST BASH 
SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN 
BRITAIN INCLUDING MARKS AND AMP SPENCER 
IN INDIAN TERMS THIS IS AS GOOD AS 
IT GETS NOTHING CAN PREPARE THEM 
FOR THE NEXT PART OF THEIR JOURNEY 
THEY WOULD BE WORKING IN WEST DELHI 
FOR STYLECRAFT A COMPANY THAT 
MAKES BARGAIN FASHION FOR EXPORT TO 
U. K. WHOLESALERS 
THAT IS WHAT WE 
HAVE TO MAKE YES 
THAT IS LESS YES THAN TEN P. 
HERE PEOPLE WORK UP TO EIGHTEEN HOURS A 
DAY AND SLEEP ON THE PREMISES 
THERE ARE TWO TOILETS SHARED BY UP 
TO THIRTY WORKERS 
THIS PLACE IS MY 
IDEA OF HELL 
GEORGINA BRIERS IS 
USED TO GET IN WHAT SHE WANTS WHEN 
SHE WANTS IT SHE IS HOOKED ON 
THROWAWAY FASHION 
I LOVE THE FACT 
THAT YOU CAN BUY SOMETHING REALLY 
CHEAP AND YOU CAN WEAR IT ONCE AND 
JACKET AWAY 
EACH OF THEM NEEDS TO 
PRODUCE SIX GARMENTS OVER THE NEXT 
THREE DAYS BUT BY THE END OF THE 
FIRST DAY NOT A SINGLE GLANCE THEY 
HAVE SOWN HAS PASSED QUALITY 
CONTROL BLOUSE THEY HAVE SOWN 
EXHAUSTED THE GROUP BED DOWN AMONG 
THE WORKERS FOR THEIR FIRST NIGHT 
ON A FACTORY FLOOR 
GUYS GOOD 
MORNING IT IS TIME TO GET BACK TO 
WORK IT IS FREEZING 
WE CANNOT HAVE A WASH UP COS THERE 
IS NO SINK AND THERE IS NO TAP 
AND THERE IS NO SHOWER OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUSLY THE WORKERS SLEEP ON THE FLOORS 
HERE DO YOU NOT SOMETIMES FEEL BAD 
FOR THEM FOR SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR 
YES BUT YOU SEE IN CASE THEY WISH 
TO SPEND MORE ON THE LUXURIES THEY 
ARE WELCOME IT IS THEIR MONEY TO 
SPEND BUT BACK HOME THEIR NEEDS 
ARE MORE 
THE THING I AM STRUGGLING 
WITH MOST IS THE FACT THAT THESE 
THINGS THAT ARE BEING MADE 
OBVIOUSLY THE WORKERS ARE GETTING 
PAID EIGHT P. FOR THEM SO IF WE TAKE A 
NORMAL GARMENT LIKE THIS IF I 
WANTED TO BUY THIS IN A SHOP THEN 
IT WOULD PROBABLY COST ME ABOUT TEN 
I AM ENJOYING IT IT IS JUST SO 
DIFFERENT AND I THINK I DIDN'T 
REALLY PROBABLY REALISE IT WOULD 
BE SO DIFFERENT 
PEOPLE WHO WORK 
EVERY DAY GET TWELVE RUPEES FOR EACH 
ONE IT JUST SEEMS REALLY UNFAIR 
THEY ARE REALLY CHEATED 
MY HEART 
GOES OUT TO THEM IT REALLY MAKES 
ME FEEL SO SELFISH BECAUSE THEY 
ARE DOING IT FOR THEIR FAMILIES 
MOST OF THEM ARE SENDING THE MONEY 
BACK TO PUT THEIR CHILDREN THROUGH 
EDUCATION TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE 
I WOULD NOT CALL IT LIVING 
WAGE I WOULD RATHER CALL IT SURVIVAL WAGE COS THEY DON'T LIVE OFF THAT 
THEY DO NOT GO OUT FOR DINNER OR GO 
SHOPPING THEY DO NOT LIVE WITH 
THAT THEY JUST SURVIVE WITHOUT IT 
MAKES THEM NOT DIE THAT WAGE NOW NOW THEIR JOURNEY WILL TAKE THE GROUP 
SOMEWHERE FEW EUROPEANS HAVE BEEN 
THE COTTON FIELDS THREE HUNDRED MILES WEST OF 
DELHI TO WORK AS COTTON PICKERS I I STUPIDLY DID NOT EVEN REALISE THAT 
COTTON WAS EVEN PICKED IN A FIELD 
I HAVE WORKED FOR AN HOUR SO I 
HAVE EARNED SEVENTY FIVE PENCE 
THE WORKERS 
HERE EARNED THE EQUIVALENT OF ONLY 
SIX A WEEK 
HOW OFTEN DO YOU BOTH 
SPEND MONEY ON YOUR CLOTHES 
OH MY GOSH TWICE A YEAR THAT IS 
REALLY BAD L. HAVE NEVER HAD TO 
STRUGGLE FOR ANYTHING 
IF PICKING 
COTTON WAS HARD LIFE IN THE MAIL 
WOULD BE TOUGHER THE GROUP'S JOB 
WILL BE TO FEED THE COTTON THROUGH 
THE MACHINES MAKING IT READY TO BE 
SPUN INTO CLOTH THE WORKERS HERE 
MUST WORK NON STOP OR THE MACHINES 
WILL JAM 
THIS JOB THAT I AM DOING 
NOW PROBABLY THE MOST HARD WORK I 
HAVE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE 
IT IS 
MISERABLE 
DO NOT SHOUT AT ME MISERABLE PLEASE DO NOT SHOUT IN MY FACE I I KNOW THAT I PERSONALLY WOULD BE 
HAPPY TO PAY A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR 
WHATEVER I AM BUYING TO KNOW THAT 
IT HAS NOT BEEN MADE IN HORRIBLE 
CONDITIONS GETTING PAID NEXT TO 
NOTHING 
THE TWO SAD TO THINK THAT NOTHING THESE PEOPLE STRUGGLE AFTER THEY 
WORK SO HARD IT IS NOT LIKE THEY 
ARE LAZY AND JUST SITTING ON THEIR 
BUTT IT DOES MAKE YOU THINK 
SOMETHING IS NOT QUITE RIGHT HERE 
A WOULD BE CUT AND SUSAN NOVA SOON 
WORK HERE WILL DRY UP FORCING 
MIGRANT WORKERS TO FIND EMPLOYMENT 
ELSEWHERE WITH OF THE COTTON 
SEASON OVER MANY WILL HAVE TO 
MUMBAI WHERE THE SIX WILL FACE 
THEIR FINAL CHALLENGE MUMBAI IS 
HOME TO THE LARGEST SLUMP IN ASIA 
DHARAVI A ONE OF BACKSTREET 
FACTORIES THAT CHURN OUT MILLIONS 
OF GARMENTS FOR EXPORT ALL OVER THE 
WORLD MANY ENDING UP IN BRITAIN 
NOTHING THEY HAVE EXPERIENCE SO FAR 
HAS PREPARED THEM FOR THIS IT IT STINKS IT MAKES YOU GAG IT IS 
FILTHY THERE IS BLUE ON THE FLOOR 
WE ON THE FLOOR RATS ON THE FLOOR 
DEAD DOGS ON THE FLOOR IT IS THE 
WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN IN MY 
LIFE 
THIS 
IS A TYPICAL PLACE IT LIFE IS A VERY SMALL PLACE BUT A LOT OF 
PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED IN IT 
IS THIS 
LEGAL 
THESE FACTORIES ARE LEGAL COMPLETELY LEGAL 
BUT THIS IS 
ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING 
THE WORKING 
CONDITIONS ARE DREADFUL 
OH MY GOD A BIT OF THE CEILING HAS 
JUST FELL OFF 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY 
AWFUL HERE 
A SAFE WORKING ENVIRONMENT WHERE 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DIE OF DISEASE 
IS IS NOT A LOT TO ASK FOR IT IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE BRAND THAT IS 
MIGHT GET THEIR STUFF MADE IN 
PLACES LIKE THIS SHOULD BE ASHAMED 
OF THEMSELVES 
THERE IS A BOY IN HERE HE'S ABOUT 
FOURTEEN FOURTEEN THERE HAVE BEEN CERTAIN TIMES WHEN 
I'VE FELT SAND I'VE FELT PITY FOR 
PEOPLE BUT TODAY IT'S MADE ME 
UMM THINK THAT I NEED TO DO 
SOMETHING MAYBE 
I DEFINITELY LIKE 
TO FIND OUT WHY CHILDREN ARE 
WORKING IN THESE CONDITIONS WHY 
THEY ARE NOT AT SCHOOL 
HAVING SEEN 
CHILDREN WORKING IN THE SLUMP 
FACTORIES THE GROUP WANTED TO KNOW 
MORE THEY ARE VISITING A A SCHOOL 
SET UP BY LOCAL CHARITY TO MEET

I NEVER REALLY 
BOUGHT SUPER DUPER CHEAP CLOTHES 
ANY WAY L. USED TO SHOP ON THE HIGH 
STREET OFTEN L. BUY THINGS STILL 
FROM THE HIGH STREET BUT WE DO 
CHECK THE LABELS DON'T WE AND 
THINGS LIKE THAT AUND THINK HOW HOW ARE THEY TO KNOW THE CONDITIONS 
UNDER WHICH CLOTHES ARE BEING MADE 
THAT IS THE BIG PROBLEM ISN'T IT 
RETAILERS THE LEADING RETAILERS 
PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO 
UNDERSTANDING EXACTLY HOW THINGS 
ARE MADE BECAUSE THEY SHARE EXACTLY 
THOSE CONCERNS THE MAJOR BRANDS DO 
NOT WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
VERY POOR PRACTICES THAT WE SAW 
ALL OF THE MAJOR BRANDS WE WILL 
NOT NAME THEM RIGHT NOW THE ONE 
THAT DON'T PLAY BY THE RULES YOU 
AND I BOTH KNOW SOME OF STHREM 
SERIOUS RESERVATION ABOUTS TAKING 
PART IN SOME OF THESE SCHEMES THE 
MAJOR CLOTHING BRANDS MEMBERS OF 
THE BRITISH RETAIL CONSORTIUM ARE 
ENGAGED 
THEY ARE NOT ALL 
I CAN 
ONLY SPEAK FOR OUR MEMBERS THEY ARE 
ENGAGED IN THE ETHICAL TRADING 
INITIATIVE AND SIMILAR THINGS TO 
ADDRESS PRECISELY THESE PROBLEMS 
WHEN YOU GOT BACK YOU TRIED TO 
CONTACT SOME OF THE MAJOR HIGH 
STREET RETAILERS WHAT DID YOU DO 
I SENT LETTERS AND E. MAILS TO 
HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT STORES ALL 
MY FAVOURITE STORES STORES THAT 
I'VE SHOPPED IN REGULARLY YOU KNOW 
EVER SINCE I WAS LITTLE DIDN'T 
GET ANY RESPONSE NO ONE WOULD 
REALLY TELL ME WHERE MY CLOTHES 
WERE BEING MADE 
YOU DON'T MEAN 
HUNDREDS YOU MEAN YOU WROTE MANY 
LETTERS AND E. MAILS AWAY PROBABLY PROBABLY ANY RESPONSES 
TWO 
RESPONSES TWO TWO RESPONSES THAT IS THE PROBLEM X. 
ISN'T IT 
I THINK THERE ARE TWO 
WAYS THAT WE CAN HELP MOVE THINGS 
FORWARD HERE THE FIRST IS THE 
GENERAL APPROACH THAT COMPANIES ARE 
TAKING UNDERSTOOD UNDER THINGS LIKE 
THE E. T. I. BEING 
THE ETHICAL TRADELE BEING INITIATIVE WHICH IS ABOUT GETTING 
A BASIC LEVEL OF ASSURANCE IN PLACE 
SO THAT THE RETAILER CAN REASSURE 
THEMSELVES THAT THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS 
BEING IS EMPLOYING PEOPLE ON FAIR 
STANDARDS CONSIST WENT 
INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION 
STANDARDS 
YOU HAVE HEARD OF THIS STANDARDS SCHEME NO ARE THEY TO KNOW IF 
THEY ARE BEINGETHICALLY MADE IT IT SAPBT SCHEME THAT HAS THE CUSTOMER 
IN VIEW IN TERMS OF THE BRAND IT'S 
FAIR TRADE 
IT WILL NOT CHANGE 
UNTIL CONSUMERS WHO SAY WE ARE NOT 
HAVING CLOTHES MADE BY CHILDREN IN 
DISGUSTING CONDITIONS HOW ARE THEY 
TO BE ABLE TOLL MAKE THEIR MIND UP 
SOME CON SUEPERS ARE CONCERNED 
HOW ARE THEY TO KNOW 
THAT IS WHAT 
SCHEMES LIKE THE FAIR TRADE SCHEME 
IS ABOUT IF YOU WANT TO BE SURE 
THAT PARTICULAR PRODUCT HAS BEEN 
KNEAD A PARTICULAR WAY FOR PEOPLE 
FOR WHOM THAT IS IMPORTANT CAN YOU 
DO THAT FOR MOST CONSUMERS COSTS 
AND CONVENIENCE ARE THE MAIN 
DRIVERS IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE 
RETAILERS ARE CONCERNED THAT THEY 
CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS IN AN 
ETHICAL WAY AND THEREFORE THEY 
ARE HANDLING THAT WITHIN THEIR 
SUPPLY CHAIN 
ARE YOU PERSUADED BY 
THIS GIRLS 
WITH THE FAIR TRADE 
THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE BEEN LOOKING 
AT THERE IS NO REAL THINGS OUT 
THERE I'VE SEEN A COUPLE OF THINGS 
THAT SAY FAIR TRADE ON THEM 
THERE IS A DEMAND OUT THERE FROM 
THE PEOPLE I'VE SPOKEN TO FOR FAIR 
TRADE ITEMS THERE IS NOT THE 
RETAILERS HAVEN'T PUT THE 
INFRASTRUCTURE THERE TO GET THE 
DEMAND OUT TO THE CONSUMERS SO I 
THINK SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE 
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT FAIR 
TRADE WHO IS TO KNOW KNOW AT THE 
MOMENT NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THEIR 
CLOTHES ARE COMING FROM 
YOU NEED 
TRANSPARENCY YOU SEE 
FOR SOME 
CONSUMERS THAT IS ABSOLUTELY 
ESSENTIAL YOU 
GO 
ON ABOUT SOME 
ESSENTIAL CONSUMERS IS IT NOT ALWAYS ETHICAL 
UNACCEPTABLE BY SELLING STUFF IN 
OUR SHOPS MADE BY CHILDREN IN 
DIGUSTING CONDITIONS ISN'T THAT 
ALWAYS WRONG 
THAT IS WHY MAJOR 
RETAILERS ARE ENGAGING WITH THEIR 
SUPPLIERS AND AUDITING THEIR SUPPLY 
CHAINS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT 
WASN'T HAPPENING 
SUPPOSING THERE 
WAS A LAUL BROUGHT IN THAT 
AUTHORITIES HERE WHO COULD 
PROSECUTE RETAILERS WHO SOLD 
CLOTHES MADE IN UNACCEPTABLE 
CONDITIONS WHAT WOULD YOU THINK 
ABOUT THAT 
MAJOR RETAILERS ARE 
CONCERNED THAT THE INTERNATIONAL 
LABOUR ORGANISATION STANDARDS 
WHICH IS THE LEGAL SITUATION IN 
MANY COUNTRIES IS SPLIED COMPLIED 
WITH THAT IS WHAT WE ARE WORKING 
TOWARDS 
DO YOU THINK ALL THE TOWARDS CONDITIONS WE SAW IN THAT FILM WERE 
ACCEPTABLE 
ABSOLUTELY NOT L. THINK ACCEPTABLE YOU WILL FIND THAT THE MAJOR 
RETAILERS ARE NOT DOING BUSINESS 
WITH THOSE FACTORIES WHERE NO NO WHERE THE CONDITION AREN'T 
ACCEPTABLE 
FOR ME THE MOST ACCEPTABLE IMPORTANT THING TO DO IS TO WE ARE 
NOT WORLDLY WOMEN WE ARE NOT SAYING 
THAT WE ARE TWO SHOPPERS WHO ARE 
TYPICAL SHOPPERS 
TYPICAL SHOPPERS 
WE JUST NEED TO LET EVERYONE KNOW 
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS THEY ARE 
WORKING IN 
THEY ARE FOR U. K. HIGH 
STREETS 
IT'S FOR LIKE 
FOR PLACES STREETS TO GO TO ESPECIALLY WHERE WE FOUND 
THE CHILDREN 
IF THE SHOPS GOT 
TOUGHER WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET 
GEAR OFF YOU UNLESS WE KNOW THAT IS 
WHERE IT'S FROM WE WON'T DO IT 
EVERY HIGH SHOP STREET DO THAT WE 
WON'T HAVE CLOTHES 
THEY ARE 
AUDITING THEIR SUPPLY COMAINS TO 
MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND WHERE 
THEY DISCOVER WE CAN'T SOLVE THIS 
PROBLEM OVERNIGHT THIS IS 
SOMETHING WE NEED TO WORK ON OVER A 
PERIOD OF YEARS AND HELP THOSE 
SUPPLIERS ACTUALLY IMPROVE THEIR 
STANDARDS O. K. 
IT IS THE CONDITIONS STANDARDS O. K. AS WELL 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THANKS FOR LETTING US COME ON 
THANK YOU FOR COMING NOT MANY 
PEOPLE SAY THAT NOW COMING UP ON 
THE PROGRAMME HOW THIS MAN 
OUTWITTED THE NATIONS TOP SPOOKS 
WITH A PLANK OF WOOD AND A HOMEMADE 
MONOCLE A ROUND UP OF THE NEWS 
THE CHANCELLOR HAS RAISED THE 
PERSONAL TAX ALLOWANCE BY SIX HUNDRED THE 
OFFICIAL DEATH TOLL FROM THE 
EARTHQUAKE IN SOUTH WESTERN CHINA 
HAS RISE TON MORE THAN TWELVE THOUSAND 
MASSIVE SEARCHED AND RESCUE 
OPERATION IS CONTINUING WITH 
THOUSANDS MORE PEOPLE REPORTED TO 
BE STILL BURIED UNDER RUBBLE A 
SHORT TIME AGO I SPOKE TO OUR 
CORRESPONDENT DAN GRIFFITHS IN 
CHENGDU I ASKED HIM WHAT THE 
SITUATION WAS LIKE THERE WELL WELL IT'S A PRETTY BLEAK SITUATION 
REALLY JEREMY THE AUTHORITIES 
HERE HAVE MOBILISED FIFTY THOUSAND SOLDIERS 
TO TRY TO HELP IN A MASSIVE SEARCH 
AND RESCUE OPERATION THEY HAVE GOT 
TWO MAIN PRIORITIES ONE TO PULL 
AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE OUT OF 
THE RUBBLE ALIVE TWO TO GET AID 
FOOD SHELTER WATER AND MEDICINE 
TO THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST BUT 
OF COURSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO 
MAKE IT TO SOME OF THE WORSE 
AFFECTED AREAS THE REAL FEAR HERE 
IS THAT ONCE THEY DO GET THROUGH TO 
THOSE AREAS THERE ARE MANY MORE 
PEOPLE TRAPPED UNDERNEATH THE 
RUBBLE WE COULD SEE THE NUMBER OF 
DEAD AND THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES 
RISE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE DAYS 
AHEAD 
DOES IT SEEM TO YOU THAT THE AHEAD CHINESE AUTHORITIES HAVE THE 
RESOURCES AND THE WILL TO COPE 
CERTAINLY INTERNATIONAL AID 
AGENCIES HAVE BEEN VERY QUICK TO 
COME OUT AND PRAISE THE CHINESE 
EFFORT FOR ITS SPEED AND EFFICIENCY 
JEREMY CHINA IS USED TO NATURAL 
DISASTERS EVERY YEAR IT SUFFERS 
TYPHOONS AND FLOODS IN THAT SENSE 
THE CHINESE ARE QUICK TO BE ABLE TO 
MOBILISE LARGE FORCES WHEN THEY 
NEED TO THE PROBLEM THEY ARE 
FACING AT THE MOMENT HERE IS THE 
WEATHER WE HAVE SEEN DAYS OF 
TORRENTIAL RAIN EVEN THOUGH THEY 
ARE ABLE TO MOBILISE LARGE NUMBERS 
OF TROOPS THE WEATHER IS MAKING 
THINGS BIG PROBLEM FOR THEM THEY 
WERE HOPING TO GET HELICOPTERS INTO 
THE WORST AFFECTED AREAS BUT THEY 
CAN'T BECAUSE OF LOW CLOUD THEY 
WERE HOPING TO PARACHUTE SOME 
SOLDIERS ARE BUT THE WEATHER 
CONDITIONS ARE MAKING THAT 
IMPOSSIBLE THE RAIN IS TURNING 
THIS RESCUE OPERATION INTO A MUCH 
HARDER CHALLENGE 
THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH THE EUROPEAN UNION URGED 
BURMA TO ALLOW FOREIGN AID AND 
RELIEF WORKERS INTO THE COUNTRY TO 
HELP IN THE AFTERMATH AFTER CYCLONE 
NARGIS MORE THAN THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE 
NOW KNOWN TO HAVE DIED UN AID 
AGENCIES SAY HELP IS NEEDED TO 
PREVENT A SECOND DISASTER CAUSED BY 
STARVATION AND DISEASE AMERICA HAS 
DROPPED CHARGE AGAINST A SAUDI 
ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN THE TWENTIETH 
HIJACKER IN THE SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH 
ATTACKS MOHAMMAD AL QAHTANI WAS 
ONE OF SIX GUANTANAMO BAY DETAINEES 
CHARGED WITH MURDER AND WAR CRIMES 
HIS LAWYERS SAY HE WAS TORTURED 
DURING INTERROGATION 
THE MARKETS THE LATE ARTHUR C. CLARKE ONCE SAID 
HE COULDN'T DECIDE WHETHER IT WAS 
MORE TERRIFYING TO DISCOVER THE 
INHABITANTS OF EARTH WERE ALONE IN 
THE UNIVERSE OR TO FIND OUT WE ARE 
NOT BELIEVERS IN U. F. O.'S CLAIMED FOR 
YEARS THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN 
TRYING TO KEEP FROM US EVIDENCE TO 
SHOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN VISITED BY 
OTHER LIFE FORMS TONIGHT 
NEWSNIGHT HAS HAD EXCLUSIVE ACCESS 
TO THE TO THE SECRET FILES IN 
WHICH THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE 
RECORDED ITS INVESTIGATIONS OF THE 
SUBJECT AS STEPHEN SMITH REPORTS 
IN THE IMMORTAL WORDS OF ANDY 
MILLMAN SOMEONE'S HAVING A LAUGH 
WE HAVE GOT SOME NEWS FOR YOU OUT 
THERE THERE NO NOT YOU OUT THERE YOU HAVE BEEN 
OBJECT SERVING OUR EARTH AS I 
UNDERSTAND IT MAY WELL WATCH THIS 
SHOW FOR SIGNS OF INTELLIGENCE LIFE 
DOWN HERE BUT THE REST OF US ARE 
AT LAST GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER 
TO THE TRUTH ABOUT U. F. O.'S 
U. F. O. AS WE KNOW AND LOVE IT FIRST 
SAW THE LIGHT OF DAY NOT ON A 
HOLLYWOOD BACK LOT BUT AGAINST THE 
BACK DROP OF THESE WOODS IN SURREY 
IT WAS CREATED BY THE ENGLISH NOVEL 
H. G. WELLS THE IDEA OF A MARTIAN 
PLANTING HIS TOE GAP IN WOKE 
SOMETHING PURE FANTASY OR IS IT 
IN THIS TOP QUALITY READING OF WE 
WILLS NARRATIVE THE MARTIANS MOUNT 
THEIR ASSAULT ON US AFTER 
PLUMMETING TO WORK IN THE STOCK 
BROKER BELT A REAL U. F. O. SIGHTING 
WAS REPORTED IN WOKING ON CHRISTMAS 
DAY NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE A COUPLE OF COPPERS SAW 
IT THEY FILED A RATHER SHEEPISH 
REPORT I BET THEY DID MARTIANS IN 
SURREY YEAH THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN 
GENUINE REPORT TWO COMPETENT 
OFFICERS SLIGHTLY EMBARRASSED 
COMMON FEATURES IN H. G. WELLS THE 
ANSWER IS NOT OUT THERE BUT IN 
HERE AT THE PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICE 
AMONG DECLASSIFIED GOVERNMENT 
PAPERS ON U. F. O.'S INCLUDING LETTERS 
SENT TO SECRET AGENTS OF THE 
MINISTRY OF DEFENCE 
ANOTHER INCIDENT ALSO CHRONICLED BY 
EAGLE EYED POLICE OFFICERS PRODUCED 
A HAUNTINGLY PRESIZE STUDY OF A 
FIRST CONTACT PRECISE THE 
GOVERNMENT MONITORS THESE THINGS 
MOO MY REACTION WAS TAKE ME TO 
YOUR LAERD IT'S NICK POPE WHO 
USED TO INVESTIGATE SIGHTINGS FOR 
THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE MITT I 
THINK YOU ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN 
PILOTS WHO REPORTED THINGS CAN YOU 
TELL US ABOUT THOSE 
YES AGAIN 
OVER THE YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN A 
NUMBER OF BOTH CIVIL AND MILITARY 
PILOTS WHO HAVE SEEN AND REPORTED 
U. F. O.'S THERE WAS A CASE INVOLVING A 
WAVE OF SIGHTINGS OVER THE COUNTRY 
WHERE WITNESSES INCLUDING POLICE 
OFFICERS AND MILITARY PERSONNEL 
PEOPLE WERE DESCRIBING A VAST 
TRIANGULAR SHAPE CRAFT AIR FORCE 
WITNESS DESCRIBED THIS THING TO ME 
AS MOVING SLOWLY AND ACCELERATING 
AWAY TO THE HOR RIAZON FASTER THAN 
A MILITARY JET 
CAN YOU FEEL IT DO 
YOU SHARE IT AT LAST WE ARE 
APPROACHING THE TRUTH 
ALIENS WERE BLAMED FOR CROP CIRCLES 
THE ARMY ASKED THE MINISTRY OF 
DEFENCE'S LITTLE GREEN MEN UNIT TO 
INVESTIGATE IT IS INTERESTING YOU 
READ THE REPORT IT SAYS WE WERE 
BAFFLED WE COULDN'T FIND ANY TRACE 
IN THE CIRCLE FORMATION THAT ANYONE 
HAD BEEN THERE IT LOOKED AS IF 
SOMEONE HAD TAKE AN PLANK OF WOOD 
AND WHIRLED THIS PATTERN AROUND 
OUR FAVOURITE THEORY IS THAT IT'S A 
TORNADO THAT HAS BOUNCED OFF THE 
GROUND GROUND CALLING OCCUPANTS 
IN ONE SENSE THE REALITY WAS MUCH 
MORE DOWN TO EARTH THAN U. F. O.'S IT 
WAS NO LESS EXTRAORDINARY FOR THAT 
THE SPOOKES HAD GOT IT RIGHT THE 
FIRST TIME IF THEY DID BUT KNOW 
DOUG BOWER AND HIS MATE DAVE MADE 
THE CROP CIRCLES FOR A LAUGH WITH A 
PLANK 
IN THE PUB WHERE THEY PLANNED IT 
ALL DOUG SHOWED US HIS DESIGNS WE 
SHOWED HIM WHAT THE SECRET AGENTS 
HAD SAID ABOUT THEM 
MY CONCLUSION 
OVER ALL THESE IS COSWALLOP 
THAT'S THE TRUTH BECAUSE I'M 
SURPRISED WHAT SURPRISES ME MOST 
OF ALL IS THESE SO CALLED 
INTELLIGENT PEOPLE THAT ARE SITTING 
BEHIND A DESK UP INLE WHAUL OR 
WHETHER EVER IT IS MINISTRY OF 
DEFENCE THEY HAVE GOT TIME TO SIT 
DOWN AND WRITE THIS SORT OF THING 
IT'S FLATTERING ISN'T IT THESE 
ARE THE MOST SENIOR SPYMASTERS THEY 
HAVE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT 
THE OLD SOVIET UNION THEY CAME DOWN 
HERE AND PUT HELICOPTER UP TO 
LOOK AT YOUR HANDIWORK 
YEAH IT 
MAKES ME FEEL SO PROUD OF IT ALL 
BUT I'D LIKE TO MEET THESE 
PEOPLE I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE A 
RED FACE WOULDN'T THEY 
THEY MIGHT 
DO AS OPPOSED TO A GREEN ONE
