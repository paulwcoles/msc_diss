IT WAS MY GOOD FRIEND SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE WHO ENCOURAGED ME TO SET DOWN IN PRINT 
THE ADVENTURES I SHARED WITH THE DETECTIVE SHERLOCK HOLMES 
IT WAS DOYLE WHO HELPED TO SECURE PUBLICATION OF THESE MEMOIRS IN THE PAGES OF THE STRAND MAGAZINE 
HI CABBIE NEVER MIND GET IN WATSON 
YET NO ONE COULD HAVE PREDICTED THE EXTRAORDINARY 
OUTPOURING WHICH WAS PROVOKED BY MY MODEST LITERARY EFFORTS 
HUNDREDS OF FILMS 
HUNDREDS OF TELEVISION DRAMAS 
SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS APPEARED ON THE SCREEN MORE THAN ANY OTHER HEROIC FIGURE IN HISTORY OR IN FICTION 
SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD EVERY EXPLOIT I DESCRIBED IN PRINT HAS 
BEEN TRANSLATED TO THE SCREEN AND SOME I COULD NEVER HAVE IMAGINED 
WHY I WONDER HAS SHERLOCK HOLMES REMAINED 
SO PERSISTENT A PRESENCE MORE THAN A CENTURY AFTER HE WAS FIRST EXPOSED TO THE DANGERS OF DETECTION 
IS A KEY TO THIS CEASELESS FASCINATION THAT THERE ARE SO MANY SHERLOCKS 
THAT HIS TRUE IDENTITY HAS REMAINED FOREVER HIDDEN 
GET YOUR HANDS OFF 
EVEN FROM ME 
HOLMES 
HOLMES 
COULD IT BE THAT THE MOST COMPELLING MYSTERY IN THE CAREER OF THE WORLD'S 
FIRST CONSULTING DETECTIVE HAS BEEN HIS OWN THE MYSTERY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES 
YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT A CHILD COULD SEE THROUGH YOU 
THOSE DARK GLASSES THAT PREPOSTEROUS WIG 
COME OUT FROM BEHIND THOSE SILLY WHISKERS I KNOW YOU WATSON 
HOLMES MY DEAR FELLOW YOU HAVE SURPASSED YOURSELF 
I THINK YOU OWE MR. GILLYFLOWER AN APOLOGY 
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING HE PROVED TO BE A PUZZLE 
I HAD FIRST ENCOUNTERED HOLMES AT TWO TWENTY ONE B. BAKER STREET WHERE HE WAS SEEKING A FELLOW BACHELOR TO SHARE 
THE RENT OF COMFORTABLE THOUGH CLUTTERED ROOMS 
I WAS SOON TO DISCOVER THAT THIS FASCINATING ENIGMATIC INDIVIDUAL HAD DEVELOPED HIS MIND PROFOUNDLY 
BUT ONLY IT SEEMED IN THE CAUSE OF DETECTION 
DOCTOR WATSON 
MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES 
WAS THERE EVER A MAN SO INWARD AND SO HARD TO FATHOM 
WHAT HAD MADE HIM THIS WAY WHAT DROVE HIM ON 
I SPENT MUCH OF MY TIME ENDEAVOURING TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY 
BUT TO LITTLE AVAIL 
SHERLOCK HOLMES IS A BIT LIKE SORT OF VICTORIAN PIANOS YOU KNOW 
WHERE YOU HAD TO COVER THE LEGS SO THAT NOBODY COULD SEE THEM 
WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT HE HAD THIS BRILLIANT BRAIN 
AND WE KNOW HOW HE USED THAT IN THE STORIES 
BUT I MEAN WHAT ABOUT THE BACK STORY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES'S PARENTS FOR EXAMPLE 
THROUGHOUT OUR MANY YEARS OF ASSOCIATION HOLMES KEPT HIMSELF SECRETIVE AND ALOOF 
IN TRUTH THE LONDON FOG GREW SO THICK AROUND HIM 
THAT SOME FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE HE EVER LIVED AMONG US 
THE MAIN REASON SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS SURVIVED AS 
A CHARACTER IS THAT WE SEE HIM THROUGH THE EYES OF DOCTOR WATSON 
GOOD MORNING WATSON OH HOLMES 
HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS ME 
I'M NOT SMOKING DISTINCTIVE TOBACCO I'M NOT WEARING EAU DE COLOGNE 
YOU REEK OF THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE 
EAU DE MORGUE 
IF SHERLOCK HOLMES WERE THE VIEWPOINT CHARACTER 
IF HE WERE THE NARRATOR OR IT WAS A THIRD PERSON STORY 
IN WHICH YOU KNEW THE WORKINGS OF HIS MIND WE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FORGOTTEN HIM 
HE WOULD JUST SEEM LIKE A CONTRIVED FREAK 
THE REASON THAT THE CHARACTER STILL WORKS IS THAT WATSON WHO I THINK 
IS A MUCH BETTER ROUNDED CHARACTER IS SOMEBODY WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN AS A HUMAN BEING 
BECAUSE WE SEE HOLMES THROUGH WATSON THERE IS A SENSE THAT HOLMES TAKES ON A DEPTH AND A REALITY 
POTENTIAL CASE 
YOUNG GIRL SIXTEEN PERHAPS SEVENTEEN 
FOUND ON THE BANKS OF THE THAMES AT SHADWELL A SILK STOCKING AROUND HER THROAT 
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SENSATIONAL MATERIAL FOR ONE OF YOUR CHRONICLES 
I SUGGEST YOU ADOPT YOUR USUAL PRACTICE AND MAKE IT UP 
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR MATERIAL I'M TRYING TO SAVE A DEAR FRIEND FROM 
KILLING HIMSELF WITH NARCOTICS AND BOREDOM 
YOUR CONCERN IS TOUCHING 
HAVE GENERATIONS OF READERS AND VIEWERS BEEN SO FASCINATED 
BY THE MASTER DETECTIVE BECAUSE HE SO FREQUENTLY SLIPS FROM OUR VIEW 
AS IF SEEKING REFUGE IN THE OBSCURITY OF SHADOWS 
THE IDEA THAT HE LAYS IN BED FOR THREE DAYS AT A TIME 
AND SMOKES HIMSELF INTO A STUPOR I THINK IS QUITE COMPELLING 
THE FACT THAT HE'S PRETTY MUCH A MANIC DEPRESSIVE I THINK 
IS PROBABLY AN IMPORTANT ASPECT 
ALTHOUGH HOLMES AFFECTED NOT TO APPRECIATE MY MEMOIRS THEY HAD MADE 
HIM ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED AND RECOGNISABLE FIGURES OF HIS TIME 
WITH SOME THANKS I ADMIT TO THEIR CLEVER PROMOTION BY SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE 
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETIES THAT PRODUCED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT 
OF MATERIAL THAT IS STILL PART OF OUR POPULAR CULTURE 
AND IT MAY WELL HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT THIS WAS THE BIRTH OF THE MODERN MASS MEDIA 
IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES TO BE MUCH MORE FAMOUS THAN 
ROBINSON CRUSOE A CENTURY EARLIER BECAUSE THERE WERE MORE THINGS 
MORE MEDIA IN WHICH HE COULD BE FAMOUS 
HOLMES MADE AN APPEARANCE IN THE VERY EARLIEST DAYS OF THE CINEMA 
DISPLAYING THE TRICKERY OF THIS NEW ENTERTAINMENT 
RATHER THAN REVEALING THE TRUE ART OF DETECTION 
SHERLOCK APPEARS RIGHT AT THE DAWN OF THE 
TWENTIETH CENTURY RIGHT AT THE DAWN OF THIS NEW MOVING PICTURE TECHNOLOGY 
YOU KNOW HE'S THE FOREMOST POP CULTURE ICON OF NINETEEN HUNDRED 
AND AS THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY'S COMING IN TO MAKE MOVING PICTURES HE'S A NATURAL CHOICE TO ADAPT TO IT 
THE EBONY FILM COMPANY IN THE UNITED STATES EXPLOITED HIS CELEBRITY 
AS AN EXCUSE TO CREATE A FANTASTIC TALE INVOLVING A MAD KIDNAPPER 
NEXT CAME HOLMES AS THE ROMANTIC HERO 
WITH JOHN BARRYMORE CUTTING AN UNFAMILIAR LOVELORN FIGURE 
THE EARLY HOLMES WERE PRETTY DASHING CHARACTERS 
BARRYMORE IS A VERY VERY CLEAR REPRESENTATION I MEAN YOU KNOW HE'S A MATINEE IDOL 
IT IS LIKE CASTING I DON'T KNOW JUDE LAW OR SOMEONE DAMN SEXY 
IN THE PART 
BUT NOT ALL WAS LOST FROM THE ORIGINAL 
HE WAS MATCHED WELL AGAINST HIS ARCH ENEMY MORIARTY THE NAPOLEON OF CRIME 
THEN IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO AN ALTOGETHER MORE CONVINCING APPROACH 
FROM AN UNASSUMING ENGLISH ACTOR EILLE NORWOOD 
THIS HOLMES EVEN CARRIED COPIES OF THE ORIGINAL STORIES ON LOCATION 
TO ENSURE THAT HIS FILM STAYED CLOSELY TO THE TEXT 
ALTHOUGH HE WAS RATHER GETTING ON IN YEARS NORWOOD PROVED TO BE MUCH 
MORE TO THE TASTE OF HOLMES'S MANY FRIENDS AND ADMIRERS 
I THINK NORWOOD IS ACTUALLY QUITE A FORBIDDING AND QUITE INTERESTING FIGURE 
HE'S ACTUALLY QUITE SCARY YOU KNOW HE DOES HAVE THAT REALLY SORT OF SCARY VISAGE 
AND THAT SORT OF SENSE OF THE UNKNOWABLE ABOUT HIM 
HE DOES HAVE THAT MYSTERY WHICH HE WEARS AROUND HIM LIKE A CLOAK 
THE EILLE NORWOOD FILMS EVOKED A WORLD CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO AGES 
THE VICTORIAN AND THE MODERN 
FREQUENTLY THE FILM MAKERS VENTURED INTO THE LIVING STREETS OF LONDON IN THEIR SEARCH FOR AUTHENTICITY 
BUT THOSE STREETS WERE CHANGING BEFORE THEIR EYES 
IF YOU'RE MAKING A FILM IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO AND YOU'VE GOT A CHOICE BETWEEN SETTING IT IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY SIX AND SETTING IT 
IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO IT WAS MUCH EASIER TO GO FOR A CONTEMPORARY SETTING BECAUSE YOU COULD STILL 
YOU COULD ARGUE THAT SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS STILL A CURRENT CHARACTER 
WHEN THE CINEMA BEGAN TO TALK AUTHENTICITY WAS THE LAST THING ON ANYONE'S MIND 
BASIL RATHBONE AND NIGEL BRUCE BROUGHT TO THE SCREEN AN ALTOGETHER 
NEW KIND OF HOLMES AND WATSON BOTH AUTHORITATIVE AND ENTERTAINING 
NOW SUPPOSE YOU TELL US ALL ABOUT IT 
WELL THIS CAME FOR MY BROTHER LLOYD IN THE POST TWO DAYS AGO 
THE SOUND IS WHAT MAKES RATHBONE AND BRUCE SO PRE EMINENT 
H. M. M. THIS SEEMS TO BE A FIELD DAY FOR CRANK MESSAGES LOOK AT THAT WATSON 
CURIOUS MAY ELEVENTH THAT'S TODAY 
MY FATHER RECEIVED JUST SUCH A NOTE BEFORE HE WAS MURDERED 
MURDERED MURDERED 
YOU GET A VERY VERY DOMINANT FIGURE RATHBONE'S HOLMES ISN'T VAGUE IN ANY SENSE HE'S ABSOLUTELY DEFINED 
VERY VERY ACTIVE VERY VERY DYNAMIC 
FROM THIS MOMENT HOLMES AND WATSON WOULD GAIN AN EQUAL FOOTING IN THE AUDIENCE'S AFFECTIONS 
VERY GOOD MR. HOLMES WHAT ON EARTH IS THIS HOLMES 
A SOUTH AMERICAN BOLAS THE WEAPON THAT KILLED LLOYD BRANDON WHAT 
YES COME AND TAKE A LOOK AT HIS MURDERER 
UNFORTUNATELY THE PRICE PAID FOR THIS NEW EQUALITY 
WAS NIGEL BRUCE'S INFLUENTIAL BUT MISLEADING IMPRESSION THAT WATSON WAS A FORGETFUL AGING BUFFOON 
WELL WATSON YOU'RE BURSTING WITH NEWS WHAT IS IT MAN SPEAK UP WE'VE NO SECRETS FROM MISS BRANDON 
MORIARTY I KNEW IT WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND OUT WATSON 
THAT FELLOW HUNTER'S WORKING FOR MORIARTY THEY WERE TOGETHER IN HUNTER'S OFFICE 
I WATCHED MORIARTY LEAVE EXCELLENT 
NOW WHAT DID MR. HUNTER DO THEN I DON'T KNOW 
YOU DON'T KNOW NO I CAME AWAY DIRECTLY TO TELL YOU WHAT I'D DISCOVERED 
HAVE I. HAVE I DONE SOMETHING WRONG I HOPE NOT 
EVEN THE PRESENCE OF LADIES DID NOT INHIBIT THIS HOLMES FROM MAKING 
WATSON LOOK A FOOL HE COULD NEVER DO ANYTHING VICIOUS I'M SURE 
I WAS GONNA SAY HOLMES THAT 
WELL WHAT WERE YOU ABOUT TO SAY WATSON 
NOTHING 
WATSON YES 
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE AN INCORRIGIBLE BUNGLER 
NO I THINK YOU HAVE TO START WITH THE BASIS THAT HE'S A DOCTOR AND YOU CAN'T BE ENTIRELY STUPID TO BE A. 
I COULDN'T BE A DOCTOR 
AN ENGLISHNESS OF WHICH 
NIGEL BRUCE WAS THE EPITOME AT THAT TIME AND HOLLYWOOD PRESENTED A VERY COMICAL IDEA OF THE ENGLISHMAN 
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU MR. HUNTER AND I'VE FOUND OUT WHAT DOCTOR WATSON 
WHATEVER WATSON HAS FOUND OUT YOU'LL KNOW INEVITABLY 
I HAVE UNBOUNDED CONFIDENCE IN HIS LACK OF DISCRETION 
MEANWHILE WE'VE WORK TO DO OUTSIDE BEFORE IT GETS TOO LATE 
MR. HOLMES EXCUSE US 
YOU PUSHED ME OUT OF THE ROOM AS IF I WERE A CHILD WHAT AM I TO MAKE OF THIS HOLMES 
ANYTHING BUT SUCH A PETULANT FACE OLD FELLOW COME ALONG 
I COULD HAVE MADE HER CONFESS ABOUT MORIARTY 
EXACTLY WHAT I DIDN'T WANT 
IF MORIARTY'S BEHIND THIS CASE HUNTER WILL LEAD US TO HIM 
ENJOYABLE AS NIGEL BRUCE'S WATSON IS 
ER IT MAKES A BIT OF A NONSENSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP I THINK 
ALL RIGHT HOLMES I'VE FOUND HIM 
WOULD SHARE HIS LIFE WITH SOMEONE AS BUMBLING JOKEY AND FUNNY AS NIGEL BRUCE WAS 
READY WHEN YOU ARE 
IT'S APPALLING REALLY THAT NIGEL BRUCE'S WATSON IS SO DISMISSED ALMOST 
ERM ALMOST AUTOMATICALLY BY A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WHO SORT OF GO OH BUFFOON DUFFER BLAH BLAH BLAH 
IT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST COMIC PERFORMANCES EVER COMMITTED TO FILM 
IT'S FANTASTIC 
I SAY THERE HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED 
DEFINITELY WOULD YOU MIND MOVING BACK A FEW PACES 
NOT AT ALL THANK YOU 
PERHAPS I CAN FIND A DOCTOR 
I'M A DOCTOR WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU 
I'M ALL RIGHT I WAS THINKING OF YOU 
WHY 
BUT BUT AREN'T YOU ILL 
CERTAINLY NOT I'M DEAD 
WELL I'M AFRAID I MUST BE GETTING ON 
DON'T LET ME DETAIN YOU 
STUPID FELLOW 
ALTHOUGH THE FIRST RATHBONE FILMS WERE SET IN HOLLYWOOD'S IDEA OF ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETIES ENGLAND 
GERMANY BROADCASTING GERMANY BROADCASTING 
THOSE THAT FOLLOWED WERE OF THEIR TIME POSSIBLY TOO MUCH OF THEIR TIME 
THIS IS THE VOICE OF TERROR 
AGAIN WE BRING YOU DISASTER 
CRUSHING HUMILIATING DISASTER 
IT'S FOLLY TO STAND AGAINST THE MIGHTY WRATH OF THE FUHRER 
IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO OUR HERO PITTED HIMSELF AGAINST NOT JUST MORIARTY BUT THE NAZIS 
BASIL RATHBONE ALTHOUGH HE'S QUITE A GOOD 
OUR COUNTRY ENGLAND IS AT STAKE 
IF SOMEBODY GAVE ME A MODERN DAY SHERLOCK HOLMES TAKE ONE OF THE STORIES AND SET IT IN MODERN TIMES 
I WOULD ASSUME IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A COMEDY SO THAT'S IT 
YES KITTY THE NAZIS KILLED HIM 
HELP ME TO FIND OUT WHAT CHRISTOPHER MEANS AND I PROMISE THE MAN WHO MURDERED GAVIN SHALL PAY FOR IT 
THINK KITTY THE CUT THROATS OF THE WORLD MENACE US ALL 
I AM LAUGHING VERY MUCH SO I'M AFRAID SO BUT THEN I'VE FOUND 
YOU SEE MY OTHER PROBLEM WITH THE BASIL RATHBONE INTERPRETATION 
WAS THIS IDEA THAT SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS THIS KIND OF 
SLIGHTLY JOLLY HOCKEY STICKS PERSON YOU KNOW AND WAS RATHER MORE LIKE 
JAMES BOND REALLY THAN SHERLOCK HOLMES 
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS A VERY COMPLEX CHARACTER 
YOU'VE GOT TO CONSIDER THAT AT THE TIME 
LOADS AND LOADS OF CHARACTERS WERE BEING PRESSED INTO WAR SERVICE 
THERE WERE TARZAN WAR MOVIES THERE'S A LASSIE WAR MOVIE FOR GOD'S SAKE 
SO IT'S NOT ACTUALLY CONSIDERED THAT JARRING OR BIZARRE AT THE TIME 
IT'S THAT'S WHAT WAS HAPPENING BECAUSE THERE WAS A WAR ON GUYS 
AND IT IS CLEARLY 
A PROPAGANDA FILM IS A BIT STRONG BUT IT IS CLEARLY A FILM OF ITS MOMENT AND OF ITS TIME 
STUDENTS OF MY ORIGINAL ACCOUNTS MAY RECALL THAT HOLMES AND WATSON 
CONFRONTED A GERMAN ENEMY ON THE EVE OF AN EARLIER WAR 
THOSE ARE NOT MESSERSCHMITTS THEY'RE SPITFIRES AND HURRICANES 
RETURNING FROM BLASTING YOUR INVASION FORCES DESTROYING BARGES BY THE THOUSANDS 
WE WERE ALWAYS AT THE READY TO DO OUR DUTY FOR KING AND COUNTRY 
GERMAN DIALOGUE 
WHILE BASIL RATHBONE'S HOLMES VALIANTLY SERVED THE ALLIED CAUSE 
THE GREAT DETECTIVE RETAINED ADMIRERS IN UNEXPECTED CORNERS OF AN EMBATTLED EUROPE 
DER HUND DER HUND 
A PRINT OF THIS VERSION OF DER HUND VON BASKERVILLE 
WAS FOUND AT THE EAGLE'S NEST THE RETREAT OF ADOLF HITLER 
FROM ITS EARLIEST DAYS THE GERMAN CINEMA HAD PRODUCED MANY VERSIONS OF THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES 
SOMETHING IN THE GOTHIC MENACE OF THIS TALE CLEARLY APPEALED TO THE TEUTONIC IMAGINATION 
WHEN THE WAR WAS WON HOLMES PROCEEDED TO A NEW MEDIUM 
SADLY THE FIRST B. B. C. TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS 
PERFORMED LIVE TWICE EACH WEEK HAVE BEEN LOST TO POSTERITY 
BUT THE DOUGLAS WILMER SERIES FROM THE NINETEEN SIXTIES DOES SURVIVE 
THE HOLMES MYTH STARTS TO BECOME A HERITAGE MYTH 
BECAUSE THEY ARE BEING DONE ABSOLUTELY IN PERIOD 
DON'T TOUCH ME I TELL YOU I SAW MY HUSBAND YOUR HUSBAND IS NOT HERE 
BUT I SAW HIM 
THIS IS WHAT THE B. B. C. DOES ISN'T IT THIS IS WHAT 
THE B. B. C. CAN'T WAIT TO GET SOMEONE IN BUSTLES AND WHAT HAVE YOU 
A PLACE WHERE A LADY HAS NO BUSINESS WHERE MEN PURSUE THEIR DREAMS UNDISTURBED 
NO YOU HAVE MADE A MISTAKE 
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS AND NO HARM WILL COME TO YOU NOW OUT YOU GO 
I REMEMBER BEING ABSOLUTELY BESOTTED BY THEM 
BECAUSE I'D READ ALL THE STORIES AND I THOUGHT DOUGLAS WILMER WAS 
NOT ONLY THE BEST LOOK ALIKE BUT THEY ALSO FOLLOWED THE PLOT LINES THAT CONAN DOYLE HAD WRITTEN 
I PERCEIVE FOR INSTANCE THAT YOU LIVE IN KENT THAT YOUR HOUSE IS NOT 
FAR FROM THE RAILWAY STATION AND THAT YOU LEFT HOME BEFORE LUNCHEON 
HOW ON EARTH DID YOU KNOW THAT 
SIMPLE MADAM YOU HAVE A COPY OF THE KENT MESSENGER IN YOUR HANDBAG A MORNING PAPER AND THERE ARE 
ALSO TRACES OF MUD ON YOUR BOOTS SO IT WAS EVIDENTLY NOT WORTH YOUR WHILE TO DRIVE TO THE STATION 
AND NOW MADAM PRAY DO NOT HESITATE TO SPEAK FRANKLY 
IF YOU PREFER THAT I WITHDRAW NO NO PLEASE PLEASE IT'S IT'S JUST WHERE TO BEGIN 
I'VE GOT THE OLD STRAND MAGAZINES 
MY GREAT GRANDFATHER HAD THEM ALL BOUND SO I HAVE ALL THE ORIGINAL 
STRANDS WITH THESE STORIES IN WITH THE SIDNEY PAGET ILLUSTRATIONS 
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE SPECKLED BAND NOW 
IN BLACK AND WHITE AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE ILLUSTRATIONS THAT 
SIDNEY PAGET MADE FOR THE STORY THE ADAPTORS WENT TO ENORMOUS 
TROUBLE TO RECREATE THE ROOMS THE CLOTHES THAT PEOPLE WERE WEARING 
EVEN THE PONY AND TRAP 
NOW I FIND THAT VERY ADMIRABLE 
IS THE DRIFTING AND FRIENDLESS WOMAN 
AFTER A DOZEN PRODUCTIONS DOUGLAS WILMER TACTFULLY 
WITHDREW FROM THE FRAY FEARING AS OTHER ACTORS HAD BEFORE HIM THE CURSE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES 
WILMER THINKS HE'S GOING TO BE TYPECAST AS VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER 
ACTOR TO HAVE ACHIEVED GREAT SUCCESS AS SHERLOCK HOLMES HAS FEARED 
YOU KNOW HE'S NO LONGER A CHARACTER ACTOR HE'S A CHARACTER 
THERE REALLY IS SOMETHING TO SAY IN THAT ALL GREAT SHERLOCK HOLMES ACTORS NEVER SHAKE IT OFF 
RATHBONE NEVER SHOOK IT OFF 
AND IT CAUSES A CERTAIN UNHEALTHY EXCITEMENT AMONG THE CRIMINAL CLASSES 
YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY WANT TO BE THE GREATEST SUCCESS AS SHERLOCK HOLMES 
I THINK MOST ACTORS WOULD LIKE TO DO IT ONCE OR TWICE 
WILMER'S REPLACEMENT WAS PETER CUSHING 
SOMEONE WHO KNEW ABOUT CURSES AND POISONS FROM HIS YEARS AS A LEADING MAN IN THE HAMMER HORROR FILMS 
HE HAD ESTABLISHED HIS HOLMES CREDENTIALS IN A HAMMER VERSION 
OF THE GERMANS' FAVOURITE THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES 
NIGEL STOCK REMAINED AS WATSON 
RATHER TOO MUCH IN THE NIGEL BRUCE MOULD FOR MY LIKING 
WATSON WE HAVE A FEW MINUTES TO OURSELVES LET US PUT THEM TO GOOD USE 
VERY WELL HOLMES WHAT IS IT YOU WANT US TO DO 
SIT DOWN MY BOY AND LET ME EXPOUND 
NOW WHOEVER CAME IN HERE COULD NOT HAVE USED THAT DOOR BECAUSE IT WAS LOCKED ON THE INSIDE 
NOW WHAT ABOUT A WINDOW AH 
YES IT IS ALSO SECURED ON THE INSIDE 
CUSHING WAS A POLITE AND GENTLEMANLY HOLMES METICULOUS 
TO THE POINT OF OBSESSION WITH THE DETAILS OF DETECTION SOMETHING THE MASTER WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED 
IT RAINED LAST NIGHT NOW HERE ON THE SILL IS THE PRINT OF A BOOT 
AS EILLE NORWOOD HAD DONE IN THE SILENT ERA HE CARRIED A 
MUCH ANNOTATED COPY OF THE COMPLETE SHERLOCK HOLMES ON SET TO KEEP HIS WRITERS AND DIRECTORS ON TARGET 
BUT THAT ISN'T A FOOT MARK NO IT IS SOMETHING MUCH MORE VALUABLE 
THE WOODEN LEGGED MAN EXACTLY 
WHILE CUSHING AND WILMER AT THE B. B. C. WERE CONCERNED TO GET THINGS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
FILMMAKERS ELSEWHERE SEEMED TO TAKE PAINS TO GET THINGS WRONG IN A FRENZY OF RE INVENTION 
FROM THE SIXTIES THROUGH THE EIGHTIES A SET OF NOT ALWAYS 
LIKELY ACTORS PORTRAYED DOPE FIEND SHERLOCK 
MAD SHERLOCK SCI FI SHERLOCK ELDERLY SHERLOCK YOUNG SHERLOCK AND LEAST LIKELY OF ALL 
STUPID SHERLOCK COURTESY OF MICHAEL CAINE AS HOLMES AND BEN KINGSLEY AS WATSON 
WATSON IS VERY CLEVER AT SOLVING CRIMES 
BUT NO ONE WILL LISTEN TO HIM 
SO HE INVENTS A CHARACTER CALLED SHERLOCK HOLMES 
THEN HE HIRES A DRUNKEN OUT OF WORK ACTOR TO PLAY HIM AND THAT'S ME 
MR. HOLMES 
IS THERE ANY NEWS ANYTHING AT ALL SADLY NO BUT TAKE HEART MISS LAST NIGHT SOMETHING OCCURRED TO 
HOLMES AND HE SUDDENLY REALISED HOW STUPID HE'D BEEN REALLY 
WELL I DIDN'T SAY STUPID EXACTLY 
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT IS THAT HOLMES WAS ALWAYS VERY POMPOUS 
HE WAS ONE OF THESE PEOPLE WHO KNEW EVERYTHING HE WAS ALWAYS RIGHT 
AND TO PRICK THAT BALLOON IS QUITE A LOT OF FUN 
I DON'T THINK CONAN DOYLE WOULD HAVE MINDED TOO MUCH 
WHAT DOYLE WOULD HAVE MADE OF THIS IS ANOTHER MATTER 
IN HIS FINAL CONFRONTATION WITH MORIARTY 
HOLMES HAD REVEALED HIS PROWESS IN THE ORIENTAL MARTIAL ARTS 
BUT THIS USE OF VIOLIN FU IS SURELY A STEP TOO FAR 
WHILE ALL THESE ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS WERE BEING PRODUCED AROUND THEM 
THE PEOPLE AT I. T. V. WERE HAPPY TO PLACE THEIR TRUST IN THE AUTHENTIC SHERLOCK 
THERE'S A SORT OF COMFORT IN GOING BACK TO THE TIME WHEN IT'S ALWAYS ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
IT'S A WORLD WHICH IS A LITTLE EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THAN ERM 
THAN OUR POST NUCLEAR WORLD 
IT'S A FORM OF ESCAPISM 
A VERY PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN CROSSING THE STREET 
AND I WAS QUITE GLAD TO ESCAPE INTO IT 
INCIDENTALLY I HAVE GLANCED OVER YOUR LATEST ACCOUNT OF MY WORK 
OH YES 
HONESTLY I CANNOT CONGRATULATE YOU UPON IT 
THIS HOLMES PLAYED BY JEREMY BRETT STAYED FAITHFUL TO THE GUIDANCE OF MY WRITINGS 
DEDUCTION A COLD UNEMOTIONAL SUBJECT 
YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TINGE IT WITH ROMANTICISM THE SAME EFFECT 
AS IF YOU'D WORKED A LOVE STORY ON AN ELOPEMENT INTO THE FIFTH PROPOSITION OF EUCLID 
WHO CAN THAT BE 
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE 
A SHERLOCK HOLMES WITH THE FIRE AND ICE OF THE ORIGINAL 
JEREMY WAS VERY VERY 
DETERMINED THAT HE WOULD STICK AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO WHAT DOYLE WROTE 
I MEAN HE USED TO CARRY THE BOOK AROUND WITH HIM AND IF EVER HE FOUND BITS OF 
DIALOGUE WHICH WERE DIFFERENT FROM THE DIALOGUE THAT DOYLE HAD WRITTEN 
HE WOULD IMMEDIATELY SPOT IT AND SAY THAT'S NOT DOYLE 
AND HE WOULD DRAG IT BACK TO THAT ALWAYS 
YOUR CASE IS MOST INTERESTING 
JEREMY HAD AN EDGINESS ABOUT HIM 
SOMETHING ELSE HAS OCCURRED TO YOU 
AND HE DISCOVERED THIS DARK SIDE TO HIMSELF WHICH IS VERY MUCH PART OF HIS HOLMES' 
THIS LETTER ARRIVED THROUGH THE POST THIS MORNING 
WHICH YOU WILL PERHAPS READ FOR YOURSELF 
ENVELOPE PLEASE OH 
LONDON POSTMARK OCTOBER SEVENTH 
MAN'S THUMB MARK ON CORNER 
PROBABLY POSTMAN 
BEST QUALITY PAPER SIXPENCE A PACKET 
A PARTICULAR MAN IN HIS STATIONERY 
WATSON 
BE AT THE THIRD PILLAR FROM THE LEFT OUTSIDE THE LYCEUM THEATRE TONIGHT AT SEVEN O'CLOCK 
IF YOU'RE DISTRUSTFUL BRING TWO FRIENDS 
YOU ARE A WRONGED WOMAN AND SHALL HAVE JUSTICE 
INTENSE COLD IMPATIENT RUDE 
YET SOMEONE SO QUICK TO DEMONSTRATE HIS EXCITEMENT AT THE PROSPECT OF THE CHASE 
WHY THEN YOU AND I SHALL GO TOGETHER 
DOCTOR WATSON IS THE VERY MAN 
YOUR CORRESPONDENT SAYS TWO 
AT ANOTHER ENCOUNTER IN A LONDON THEATRE THE SHEPHERD'S BUSH THEATRE 
JEREMY BRETT REVEALED HOW DIFFICULT IT COULD BE TO KEEP THE COMPANY OF THE GREAT DETECTIVE 
YOU'RE MORE LIKE WATSON THOUGH PERSONALLY THAN YOU ARE SHERLOCK HOLMES YOURSELF WELL I THINK 
YOU'RE A KINDLIER SOUL YOURSELF I FIND HOLMES INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO WEAR 
WHEN YOU SAY WEAR YOU TAKE ON YES THE MANTLE OF HIM HE IS A. 
DARK RECLUSE INTERNAL CREATURE AND YOU CAN ONLY SHOW HIM THROUGH 
CRACKS IN THE MARBLE GLIMMERS YOU CAN'T 
HE'S TOTALLY INTERNAL AND I FIND THAT'S VERY HARD TO SUSTAIN 
I MEAN IT'S MUCH MORE FUN TO BE WATSON AND SAY WELL DONE 
WELL DONE HOLMES GOSH THAT WAS WONDERFUL EXCELLENT 
YEAH BECAUSE HE'S GOT THAT KIND OF WONDERFUL ENTHUSIASM 
HOLMES IS QUITE COOL 
AND DISMISSIVE AND ABRUPT AND THAT'S HARD TO SUSTAIN ON A DAILY BASIS 
THE BEST HOLMES IN TERMS OF ACTORS HAVE BEEN THOSE 
THAT HAVE MANAGED TO CAPTURE THE INTROSPECTIVE DARK BROODING 
DEPRESSIVE QUALITY SET AGAINST THE MAN WHOSE MIND IS RACING HE DOESN'T SLEEP HE DOESN'T EAT 
I LOVE HOLMES PACING UP AND DOWN BORED AND IRASCIBLE 
BEFORE SOMEONE BRINGS HIM A CASE 
AND WHAT TIME WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR DINNER MR. HOLMES 
HALF PAST EIGHT THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW 
THE FACT THAT HE'S PRETTY MUCH A MANIC DEPRESSIVE IS PROBABLY 
AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF HIS ABIDING POWER AS A FICTIONAL CHARACTER 
WATSON LOOK 
WHAT A FACE 
THROUGHOUT THE DECADE IN WHICH HE EMBODIED SHERLOCK HOLMES 
JEREMY BRETT STRUGGLED HIMSELF WITH MANIC DEPRESSION 
HE WAS PLAYING OUT SOME OF HIS OWN DEMONS IN THE CHARACTER OF HOLMES 
SOMEBODY ONCE SAID TO HIM IN THE EARLY DAYS DO YOU THINK THERE'S 
SOMETHING OF THE MANIC DEPRESSIVE ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES 
AND HE WAS FURIOUS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS PART OF THE TEXT BUT I THINK HE WAS EVEN THEN 
BEGINNING TO BE AWARE THAT IT WAS PART OF HIS LIFE AND HIS PROBLEM 
IN THE LATER STAGES 
WHEN THE CLASHES BETWEEN THE MEDICATION FOR HIS HEART PROBLEMS 
AND MEDICATION FOR HIS MANIC DEPRESSION PRODUCED A TENSION 
THAT WAS BOUND TO AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE 
HE WAS VERY BRAVE TO CARRY ON AT TIMES I THINK 
THANK YOU MRS. HUDSON 
IT IS THAT LOOK OF REPROACH 
NO 
NO I'M OFTEN UP AT THIS HOUR 
OH 
WHEN I WAS ADMITTED TO THE MAUDSLEY HOSPITAL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX I MEAN I WAS 
SO CONFUSED I COULDN'T RELATE TO ANYTHING OR ANYONE AROUND ME 
ALL I COULD DO WAS LIE FACE DOWN WITH MY FISTS CLENCHED IN MY FACE 
I BELIEVE I'VE BEEN COPING WITH THESE SEVERE MOOD SWINGS FOR MANY MORE YEARS THAN I LIKE TO THINK 
HOLMES 
BEING A MEMBER OF A PROFESSION WHERE BEING A LITTLE MAD HELPS MY MOODS 
WERE TOLERATED FAR MORE READILY THAN IF I WORKED IN A BANK OR A SCHOOL 
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT DREAMS WHY DO ASK 
I'M WALKING THROUGH INFERNAL TERRITORY AND YOU ASK WHY 
I ONLY MEANT 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I MEANT 
IT WAS MY SUCCESS WHICH GAVE ME THE COURAGE TO ADMIT PUBLICLY THAT I HAD THIS ILLNESS 
AS AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO OTHERS THAT IT HAD NOT STOPPED ME FROM BEING EMPLOYED 
MY DREAM IS HORRIBLE 
I AM 
FIGHTING WITH MORIARTY AT THE FALLS 
THEN SUDDENLY I'M OVERWHELMED 
WITH A SENSE OF LOSS FEAR 
YES FEAR 
JEREMY BRETT DIED WITHIN YEAR OF THE FINAL BROADCAST OF A HEART ATTACK 
THIS NEW CENTURY OFFERS US A SHERLOCK HOLMES WHO DESCENDS DEEPER STILL INTO THE MISTS OF MADNESS 
NOW HE IS ASKED TO APPLY HIS DEDUCTIVE METHODS TO THE MIND OF A SERIAL KILLER 
THIS IS THE TERRITORY OF HANNIBAL LECTER CRACKER AND SILENT WITNESS 
DOES HOLMES BELONG HERE 
MOST OF THE MURDERS THAT HOLMES DEALS WITH ARE CRIMES OF PASSION OR ACCIDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN COVERED UP 
OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT AND HE'S NOT PITTED AGAINST A SORT OF CRAZED LUST MURDERING 
YOU KNOW DERANGED PSYCHOPATH 
BUT I WAS AWARE OF THE FACT THAT SOMEHOW HE SEEMED LIKE THE RIGHT 
PERSON TO BE DOING THAT BECAUSE HOLMES IS THE SORT OF FIRST PROFILER 
YOU KNOW WHEN JOHN DOUGLAS THE F. B. I. PROFILER TALKS ABOUT HIS WORK HE SAYS THE PERSON 
THAT WAS HIS CHILDHOOD HERO WAS SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THAT HOLMES 
A HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE THE POLICE IS PROFILING COS HE IS WORKING AS A SORT OF FORENSIC DETECTIVE 
GET ON THE TELEPHONE TO SCOTLAND YARD AND TELL LESTRADE THIS IS THE BODY OF LADY ALICE PENTNEY WHAT 
THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF NARBOROUGH'S DAUGHTER 
I MEAN HOLMES WAS NOT MUCH FOR THE PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACH WAS HE 
I MEAN HE UNDERSTOOD HOW PEOPLE BEHAVED BUT I DON'T THINK 
HAVE YOU TRAVELLED MUCH SHERLOCK 
I'VE ALWAYS HELD THAT TRAVEL NARROWS THE MIND AND ON THE WHOLE IT'S BEST I SHOULD NOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY 
IT CAUSES AN UNHEALTHY EXCITEMENT AMONG THE CRIMINAL CLASSES 
IN THIS DETECTIVE STORY FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY RUPERT EVERETT'S HOLMES 
CONVERSES AFTER DINNER WITH THE FIANCEE OF HIS DOCTOR WATSON 
SHE'S PRESENTED WOULD YOU BELIEVE AS AN AMERICAN PSYCHOANALYST 
IT IS I HAVE TO SAY AN INDISPENSABLE REFERENCE FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN SEXUAL DERANGEMENT 
THANK YOU YOU MAY KEEP IT YOU'RE MOST KIND 
IT HAS A WONDERFUL ARRAY OF PERVERSIONS SADO MASOCHISM 
BESTIALITY EXHIBITIONISM TRANSVESTISM COPROPHILIA I'M OUT OF THE ROOM FOR TEN MINUTES 
PEDERASTY NECROPHILIA RAPE MUTILATION 
AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENS 
AT LEAST EVERETT'S HOLMES APPEARS SHOCKED BY ALL THIS TALK HOLMES 
ER STRONG AND BLACK PLEASE WATSON 
I THOUGHT IT WAS UTTERLY ABSURD IT WAS SO OUT OF ITS TIME 
FOR EXAMPLE ALL THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SEXUAL SADISM AND PSYCHOPATHY BEARING IN MIND 
FREUD HAD ONLY WRITTEN THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS 
I THINK IT WAS PUBLISHED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
PSYCHOANALYSIS HARDLY EXISTED IN THOSE DAYS 
TO BRING MODERN KNOWLEDGE TO A CHARACTER FROM A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERIOD 
IN THE END OF COURSE DEDUCTION WOULD LEAD EVEN THE MOST MODERN HOLMES INTO THE CRIMINAL'S LAIR 
RELEASE HER OR I WILL SHOOT CAN YOU BE SURE OF YOUR AIM 
LET HER GO 
HERE HE WILL CONFRONT THE EVIL DOER WITH THE POWER OF 
HIS RAPIER INTELLECT AND HIS INSIGHT INTO THE TORMENTED MIND 
IT'S LIKE A DOOR ISN'T IT 
IT OPENS 
IF YOU WALK THROUGH 
YOU CAN NEVER TURN BACK 
I KNOW 
BECAUSE IT'S AN ADDICTION 
AND WE NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE EACH TIME DON'T WE 
TO LIFT US 
TO GET US TO THE SAME HEIGHTS 
I THINK THERE'S A TREMENDOUS APPEAL IN SEEING SOMEONE COME UP AGAINST 
WHAT SEEMS TO BE AN INSOLUBLE PROBLEM OR A TERRIBLE INJUSTICE AND BE ABLE TO PUT IT RIGHT 
AND THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT APPEALS ABOUT HOLMES TO SO MANY PEOPLE I THINK 
HE WAS ABLE TO PUT THINGS RIGHT 
PUTTING THINGS RIGHT 
TO MY AMAZEMENT HE HAS BEEN DOING SO FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS 
I SHALL EVER REGARD HOLMES AS THE BEST AND WISEST MAN WHOM I HAVE EVER KNOWN 
HOWEVER MANY FACES HE PRESENTS TO THE WORLD 
HE HAS OFTEN BEEN THOUGHT TO HAVE RETIRED EVEN TO HAVE DIED BUT IT HAS NEVER LASTED FOR LONG 
EVENTUALLY A TERSE TELEGRAM WILL ARRIVE COME WATSON THE GAME IS AFOOT 
WHAT A LOVELY MORNING HOLMES 
THERE'S AN EAST WIND COMING WATSON 
NO I DON'T THINK SO IT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER WARM DAY 
GOOD OLD WATSON 
A ONE FIXED POINT IN A CHANGING AGE 
THERE'S AN EAST WIND COMING ALL THE SAME 
SUCH A WIND AS NEVER BLEW ON ENGLAND YET 
IT WILL BE COLD AND BITTER WATSON 
AND A GOOD MANY OF US MAY WITHER BEFORE ITS BLAST 
BUT IT'S GOD'S OWN WIND NONETHELESS AND A GREENER BETTER STRONGER LAND 
WILL LIE IN THE SUNSHINE WHEN THE STORM HAS CLEARED
