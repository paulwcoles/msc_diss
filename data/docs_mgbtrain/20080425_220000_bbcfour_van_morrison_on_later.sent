YOU CAME TO SEE ME WHEN THE MOON WAS NEW 
SAW YOU STANDIN' IN THE POURING RAIN 
LEFT MY MESSAGE ON THE WINDOWSILL 
BACK ON THE STREET AGAIN 
BACK ON MY BEAT AGAIN 
I'M BACK ON THE TOP AGAIN 
SAW ME CLIMBING TO THE TOP OF THE HILL 
YOU SAW ME MEETING WITH THE FOOLS ON THE HILL 
LEARNED MY LESSON AND I'M LEARNING IT STILL 
LEARNT IT ALL IN VAIN 
BACK ON THE STREET AGAIN 
BACK ON THE TOP AGAIN 
ALWAYS STRIVIN' ALWAYS CLIMBING WAY BEYOND MY WILL 
SAME OLD SENSATION ISOLATION AT THE TOP OF THE BILL 
ALWAYS SEEMING LIKE I'M MOVING BUT I'M REALLY GOING SLOW 
YOU FIND OUT WHEN YOU REACH THE TOP THAT THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO 
HOW I GET THERE WILL BE ANYBODY'S GUESS 
WITH ALL THE SO CALLED TRAPPINGS OF SUCCESS 
LEFT ALL THE DEADBEATS ON THE TOP OF THE HILL 
TOO BUSY RAISIN' CAIN 
BACK ON THE STREET AGAIN 
BACK ON THE TOP AGAIN 
ALWAYS STRIVIN' ALWAYS CLIMBING WAY BEYOND MY WILL 
SAME OLD SENSATION ISOLATION AT THE TOP OF THE BILL 
ALWAYS SEEMING LIKE I'M MOVING BUT I'M REALLY GOING SLOW 
YOU'LL FIND OUT WHEN YOU GET TO THE TOP THAT THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO 
HOW YOU GET THERE WILL BE ANYBODY'S GUESS 
WITH ALL THE SO CALLED TRAPPINGS OF SUCCESS 
LEFT ALL THE DEADBEATS ON THE TOP OF THE HILL 
TOO BUSY RAISIN' CAIN 
I'M BACK ON THE STREET AGAIN 
BACK ON THE TOP AGAIN 
BACK ON THE STREET AGAIN 
BACK ON MY FEET AGAIN 
BACK ON THE TOP AGAIN 
I SAW YOU STANDING WITH THE WIND 
AND THE RAIN IN YOUR FACE 
AND YOU WERE THINKING BOUT THE WISDOM OF THE LEAVES 
AND THEIR GRACE 
WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
AND AT NIGHT THE MOON IS SHINING ON A CLEAR CLOUDLESS SKY 
AND WHEN THE EVENING SHADOWS FALL I'LL BE THERE BY YOUR SIDE 
WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
FOLLOW ME DOWN 
FOLLOW ME DOWN 
FOLLOW ME DOWN 
TO THE PLACE BESIDE THE GARDEN AND THE WALL 
FOLLOW ME DOWN 
FOLLOW ME DOWN 
TO THE SPACE BETWEEN THE TWILIGHT AND THE DAWN 
OH THE LAST TIME I SAW PARIS IN THE STREETS IN THE RAIN 
AND AS I WALK ALONG THE BOULEVARDS WITH YOU ONCE AGAIN 
WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
WHEN WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
FOLLOW ME DOWN 
FOLLOW ME DOWN 
FOLLOW ME DOWN 
TO THE PLACE BESIDE THE GARDEN AND THE WALL 
FOLLOW ME DOWN 
FOLLOW ME DOWN 
TO THE SPACE BETWEEN THE TWILIGHT AND THE DAWN 
AND AS I'M LOOKING AT THE COLOUR OF THE LEAVES IN YOUR HAND 
AS WE'RE LISTENING TO CHET BAKER ON THE BEACH IN JUAN LES PINS 
WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
YES IN SEPTEMBER IN THE RAIN WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
HEY WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
YEAH IN SEPTEMBER IN THE RAIN WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
IN SEPTEMBER IN THE RAIN WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
IN SEPTEMBER IN THE RAIN 
WHEN THE LEAVES COME FALLING DOWN 
PRECIOUS TIME IS SLIPPIN' AWAY 
BUT YOU'RE ONLY KING FOR A DAY 
IT DOESN'T MATTER TO WHICH GOD YOU PRAY 
PRECIOUS TIME IS SLIPPING AWAY 
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH ROUTE YOU TAKE 
SOONER OR LATER YOU HEART'S GONNA BREAK 
NO RHYME OR REASON NO MASTER PLAN 
NO NIRVANA NO PROMISED LAND 
PRECIOUS TIME IS SLIPPIN' AWAY 
YOU KNOW YOU'RE ONLY KING FOR A DAY 
IT DOESN'T MATTER TO WHICH GOD YOU PRAY 
PRECIOUS TIME IS SLIPPIN' AWAY 
QUE SERA SERA WHATEVER WILL BE 
KEEP ON SEARCHING FOR IMMORTALITY 
SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL BUT SHE'S GONNA DIE SOME DAY 
EVERYTHING IN LIFE JUST PASSES AWAY 
PRECIOUS TIME IS SLIPPIN' AWAY 
YOU KNOW SHE'S ONLY QUEEN FOR A DAY 
DOESN'T MATTER TO WHICH GOD YOU PRAY 
PRECIOUS TIME IS SLIPPIN' AWAY 
ALL RIGHT 
WELL THIS WORLD IS CRUEL WITH ITS TWISTS AND ITS TURNS 
WELL THE FIRE'S STILL IN ME AND THE PASSION IT BURNS 
I LOVE A MELODY TILL THE DAY I DIE 
TILL HELL FREEZES OVER AND THE RIVERS RUN DRY 
PRECIOUS TIME IS SLIPPIN' AWAY 
YOU KNOW SHE'S ONLY QUEEN FOR A DAY 
DOESN'T MATTER TO WHICH GOD YOU PRAY 
PRECIOUS TIME IS SLIPPIN' AWAY 
PRECIOUS TI IME IS SLIPPIN' AWAY 
YOU KNOW SHE'S ONLY QUEEN FOR A DAY 
DOESN'T MATTER TO WHICH GOD YOU PRAY 
PRECIOUS TIME IS SLIPPIN' AWAY
