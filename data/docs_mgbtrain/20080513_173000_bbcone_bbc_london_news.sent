HELLO AND GOOD EVENING 
TONIGHT IT SEEMS THE FIGHT BACK 
MAY BE STARTING NEW STOP AND 
SEARCH TEAMS ARE TO BE DEPLOYED BY 
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE IN AN 
ATTEMPT TO CUT THE SPATE OF MURDERS 
OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT HAS CLAIMED SEVENTY 
LIVES IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS DESCRIBED AS A 
FAIRLY IN YOUR FACE APPROACH 
OFFICERS WILL START AS BY 
TARGETING TEN BOROUGHS IN TEN DAYS 
WHERE THE WORST VIOLENCE HAS BEEN 
SEEN IN A MOMENT WE WILL SPEAK TO 
THE NEW DEPUTIES MAYOR FOR POLICING 
IT IS CONTROVERSIAL BUT THIS IS 
WHAT WE WILL BE SEEN MUCH MORE OF 
STOP AND SEARCH ON THE STREETS 
WITH WIDER USE OF METAL DETECTING 
ARCHES AND SCANNERS FROM TONIGHT 
ONE SOUTH LONDON BOROUGH WILL BE 
TARGETED THEN A FURTHER NINE 
WITHIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS THE 
METROPOLITAN POLICE SAYS ENOUGH IS 
ENOUGH 
WE ARE GOING TO DENY THE ENOUGH STREET TO PEOPLE WHO CARRY WEAPONS 
WE WILL ARREST YOU AND PUT YOU IN 
FRONT OF A COURT WE MUST INCREASE 
THE CONFIDENCE OF PEOPLE THAT THEY 
CAN WALK THE STREET WITHOUT 
CARRYING KNIVES OR GUNS THIS THIS FOLLOWS THE WORRYING TREND OF YOUTH 
VIOLENCE AS WE REVEALED LAST NIGHT 
NEARLY SEVENTY PEOPLE UNDER TWENTY FIVE HAVE BEEN 
MURDERED IN LESS THAN A YEAR AND A 
HALF SIXTEEN YEAR OLD JIMMY MIZEN WAS 
THE THIRTEENTH TEENAGER THIS YEAR KILLED 
IN AN UNPROVOKED ATTACK AT A BAKERY 
IN SOUTH LONDON THIS AFTERNOON A 
NINETEEN YEAR OLD YOUTH WAS ARRESTED 
YESTERDAY A TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD MAN WAS 
STABBED TO DEATH ON OXFORD STREET 
IT HAS DEEPLY AFFECTED SOME 
LONDONERS 
I. M. NOT SAFE ANY MORE LONDONERS SINCE THIS INCIDENT 
EVEN DAYTIME 
YOU DON'T FEEL SAFE I AM NOT 
SAFE IT IS SHOCKING 
BUT STOP AND 
SEARCH HAD A DIFFICULT HISTORY 
OFTEN SEEN AS TARGETING SPECIFIC 
ETHNIC GROUPS RATHER THAN BEING 
INTELLIGENCE READ 
LEAD THIS IS 
NOT ABOUT HARASSING YOUNG PEOPLE IT 
IS ABOUT MAKING THEM SAFER WE HAVE 
TO SAY CLEARLY AS A CITY THE 
COMMUNITIES POLICE THE MAYOR 
EVERYBODY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH WE 
DON'T WANT TO CARRYING WEAPONS 
WHEN YOU KIT AND AN ARGUMENT YOU 
MAY USE IT WHICH WAY WILL LEAD 
TO LOSS OF LIFE NINETY PER CENT OF THESE ARE 
DETECTED HE WILL END UP IN PRISON 
POLICE HAVE DESCRIBED IT AS AN IN 
YOUR FACE POLICY CRACKING DOWN ON 
THOSE WHO ROUTINELY CARRY WEAPONS 
IN PUBLIC BUT SOME COMMUNITIES 
WILL BE DEMANDING A SENSITIVE 
APPROACH APPROACH I'M JOINED BY THE NEW DEPUTIES 
MAYOR FOR POLICING GOOD EVENING 
LET'S START WITH THE BASICS WHICH 
ARE THE AREAS THAT WILL BE CHOSEN 
AND SEARCH 
I CAN'T REVEAL SPECIFIC 
AREAS BUT THIS IS AN INTELLIGENCE 
LED OPERATION POLICE HAVE GOOD 
INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THESE 
CRIMES ARE CARING AND WHO ARE THESE 
PEOPLE ARE THESE EXERCISES ARE 
DESIGNED TO TARGET THEM AND THOSE 
AREAS BOTH TO DETER PEOPLE FROM 
CARRYING KNIVES FIND THE NIGHTS 
WHEN THE ARCA READ AND REASSURE THE 
PUBLIC 
FIND THE KNIVES WHEN THEY PUBLIC ARE CARRIED THIS IS FAIRLY IN 
YOUR FACE BUT WITH THE SUPPORT OF 
THE LOCAL COMMUNITY OF THOSE 
THINGS COMPATIBLE 
ABSOLUTELY WE 
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING WITH THE MET 
WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES ARE WE ARE 
COMPLETELY IN AGREEMENT WE KNOW 
THEY ARE BEING SENSITIVE A ROUT 
COMMUNITY ISSUES TO STOP 
COMMUNITIES IN THE AREAS THAT ARE 
BEING TARGETED WILL BE CONSULTED 
TALKED TO ABOUT HOW THE OPERATION 
IS PUT INTO PLAN WE KNOW PEOPLE 
WILL SUPPORT IT BECAUSE THOSE ARE 
THE AREAS WHERE THE DEATHS ARE 
OCCURRING FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO 
MIGHT RAISE QUESTIONS I WOULD ASK 
THEM SIMPLY TO TALK TO SOME OF THE 
MOTHERS OF YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO 
HAVE BEEN KILLED AND ASK THEM IF 
THEY THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT THING 
TO DO 
SO ARE YOU SAYING WE ARE IN 
A CRISIS AND DESPERATE TIMES CALL 
FOR ZERO TOLERANCE 
THROUGHOUT THE 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN WE RAISED THIS 
AS A MAJOR ISSUE PEOPLE VOTED FOR 
US IN THEIR HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS 
IT IS IN THE FOREFRONT OF PEOPLE'S 
MINDS IT IS THE SCANDAL SO MANY 
YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE DIED ON THE 
STREETS OF LONDON IN WHAT WOULD 
OTHERWISE BE ALTERCATIONS WE HAVE 
PROMISED TO TACKLE THAT WE WILL DO 
THAT YOU WILL NOT HERE ARE TO 
BLAME ANYBODY ELSE THIS IS OUR 
RESPONSIBILITY AND WE WILL SORT IT 
OUT 
DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE THE OUT RIGHT CONTROL TO DO THAT YOU DON'T 
HAVE CONTROL OVER THE POLICE IN THE 
SAME WAY THAT THE NEW YORK MAYOR 
DOES FOR EXAMPLE WOULD YOU LIKE 
TO SEE THAT CHANGE 
WE ARE KEEN TO 
HAVE AS MUCH INFLUENCE OVER THE 
POLICE AS POSSIBLE THE CURRENT 
LINES OF ACCOUNTABILITY ARE PRETTY 
CONFUSED THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE 
WITH THEIR FINGERS IN THIS PIE ONE 
OF THE ENCOURAGING THINGS OVER THE 
LAST FEW DAYS IS THE WAY EVERYBODY 
IS RESPONDING TO THIS PRIORITY WE 
KNOW THE HOME SECRETARY IS 
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS ACTION THE 
MAYOR SUPPORTS IT AND IS IN 
AGREEMENT WITH THE POLICE WE KNOW 
THE COMMUNITIES BEING TARGETED ARE 
IN SUPPORT BECAUSE IT IS THEIR 
CHILDREN THAT ARE BEING KILLED 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THE NEW 
DEPUTY MAYOR FOR POLICING 
LOTS MORE COMING UP INCLUDING 
MODERN DAY PASSPORT TO PIMLICO HOW 
SHOREDITCH RESIDENTS ARE FIGHTING 
PLANS FOR SKYSCRAPER 
IT IS PROUDLY BRITISH AND STILL 
KNOWN TO MILLIONS AS THE WORLD'S 
FAVOURITE AIRLINE B. A. IS ONE OF THE 
MAIN SPONSORS OF THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE GAMES AND 
WILL ALSO CARRY TEAM BIANCHI TEAM 
SHE BEAT TO BEIJING THIS SUMMER 
JUST ONE SNAG IT COULD BE HARD FOR 
THEM TO COMPETE FOR GOLD WITHOUT 
PECKETT B. B. C. LONDON HAS LEARNT B. A. 
IS REFUSING TO CARRY CERTAIN 
EQUIPMENT ON FLIGHTS IN THE RUN UP 
TO THE GAMES HARD FOR THEM TO 
COMPETE WITHOUT THEIR KIT 
TOP CANOEISTS BACK HOME TODAY 
AFTER THEM WINNING MEDALS AT THE 
EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS CAREFULLY 
UNLOADING THE EQUIPMENT WHICH MAY 
KEEP THEM IN TOUCHING DISTANCE FOR 
MOST OF THEIR DAYS BUT CAN DO IS 
LIKE A SPECIALLY TO FITTED SHOE 
WHICH CAN MEAN THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN SUCCESS AND FAILURE BUT 
THERE IS A MASSIVE PROBLEM FOR 
BEIJING BRITISH AIRWAYS HAS 
DECIDED TO INTRODUCE BAN ON MARCH 
SPORTING EQUIPMENT LIKE THIS 
BECAUSE OF HANDLING DIFFICULTIES 
LARGE SPORTING EQUIPMENT THAT 
MEANS A SLOW TRIP TO CHINA FOR SOME 
OF THESE CANOES AND THE COMPETITORS 
WILL HAVE TO LIVE WITHOUT THEIR 
BOATS FOR FINAL TRAINING 
WHEN YOU 
FLY WITH YOUR CANOE YOU SEE IT 
BEING LOADED ONTO THE PLANE AND YOU 
SEE IT BEING UNLOADED WHICH JUST 
IS A GOOD THING FOR THE ATHLETES TO 
GO INTO RACING WITH 
IT IS NOT JUST 
IN THE WATER SPORTS WHERE 
COMPETITORS ARE WORRIED ABOUT A 
CHINESE CREEK WITHOUT A PADDLE WE 
UNDERSTAND THE ATHLETICS TEAM IS 
THINKING OF SWITCHING AIRLINES 
BECAUSE B. A. WILL NOT CARRY POLE 
VAULTS B. A. IS THE OFFICIAL AIRLINE 
OF THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE GAMES AS WELL AS THE U. K. 
TEAM IT WILL CARRY BIKES GUNS AND 
BOWS AND ARROWS BUT YOU HAVE A 
PROBLEM IF YOU NEED A POLE VAULT 
JACQUELIN OR CANOE 
IT SOUNDS LIKE 
A SILLY OWN GOAL JACQUELIN 
BRITISH AIRWAYS MUST NOTE ANY 
SPORTS PERSON WOULD WANT TO TRAVEL 
WITH THEIR OWN EQUIPMENT IT IS 
SILLY FOR THEM NOT TO MAKE 
ALLOWANCES 
OLYMPIC OFFICIALS SAY ALLOWANCES THEY ARE WORKING ON IT THE THE LOGISTICAL NEEDS OF THE COMPETITORS 
FOR BEIJING AND BEYOND ARE BEING 
LOOKED AT BY BRITISH AIRWAYS THOSE 
CONVERSATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE L. 
AM SURE WE WILL REACH A COMPROMISE 
BEFORE THE GAMES 
IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE BRITISH 
AIRWAYS HAS THE JOB OF FLYING 
THOUSANDS OF COMPETITORS TO LONDON 
FOR THE GAMES A PROBLEM LIKE THIS 
THEN WOULD BE A GLOBAL 
EMBARRASSMENT EMBARRASSMENT HAMPSTEAD HEATH IS ONE OF THE 
CAPITAL'S MOST POPULAR OUTDOOR 
SPORTS WHERE PEOPLE GO TO RELAX 
AND ENJOY THEMSELVES FOR THE FIRST 
TIME C. C. T. V. IS BEING USED TO TACKLE 
ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR ANGERING 
SOME REGULAR USERS WHO CLAIM IT 
WILL RUIN ITS UNIQUE ATMOSPHERE 
PAUL CURRAN IS THERE WHAT IS 
BEHIND THE INTRODUCTION OF THE 
CAMERAS 
THE PEOPLE THAT MANAGED CAMERAS THE HEATH SAY AT CERTAIN TIMES 
THEY HAVE CERTAIN PROBLEMS WHICH 
THEY FIND DIFFICULT TO HANDLE 
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE HEATH 
FOR INSTANCE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS 
THERE WILL BE A FAIR HERE THEY 
HOPE THAT WITH THESE NEW CAMERAS 
IT WILL DETER THE ANTI SOCIAL AND 
CRIMINAL ELEMENTS THAT MIGHT SOUND 
REASONABLE BUT SOME REGULAR USERS 
OF THE HEATH C. C. C. T. V. CAMERAS AS 
SOMETHING THEY ARE COMPLETELY 
OPPOSED TO THEY SEE IT AS AN 
INTRUSION BY THE CITY 
GETTING BACK TO NATURE IS PART OF 
HAMPSTEAD HEATH'S A UNIQUE APPEAL 
IT IS LONDON'S WILDEST PARK YOU 
CAN ROAM THROUGH FIELDS LIE IN THE 
GRASS OR SWIM IN THE PONDS HOW 
DOES THIS FIT IN THIS SURVEILLANCE 
CAMERA USES TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED 
FOR THE MILITARY THE IMAGES CAN BE 
PICKED UP ON ANY COMPUTER AND THE 
CAMERA CAN BE CONTROLLED REMOTELY 
IT ALLOWS US TO PLAN ZOOM IN AND 
OUT OF IMAGES SO WE ARE ABLE TO 
VIEW IMAGES FROM AFAR OR CLOSE UP 
THE CAMERA IS THE HEATH 
CONSTABULARY'S LATEST WEAPON IN THE 
FIGHT AGAINST CRIME AND ANTI SOCIAL 
BEHAVIOUR 
I HAVE A SMALL TEAM OF BEHAVIOUR CONSTABLE'S MANAGING EIGHT HUNDRED ACRES TO 
HAVE A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT CAN 
BE BROUGHT OUT ON OCCASIONS NOT 
EVERY DAY WILL HELP IN TERMS OF 
DETERRING CRIME 
IN THEORY THE 
CAMERA CAN BE USED ANYWHERE ON THE 
HEATH SOME ARE WORRIED IT WILL 
DESTROY THE FOR'S RURAL CHARM YOU YOU COME HERE TO GET AWAY FROM CROWDS 
NOISE CCT EVENT C. C. T. V. CAMERAS IT 
SHOULD BE KEPT LIKE THAT 
BUT SOME 
SUPPORT IT 
IT SHOULD BE A LOVELY 
AMENITY FOR EVERYBODY AS IT WAS 
THIS WEEKEND IT WAS GLORIOUS 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ENJOYING IT 
ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO STOP 
ANYBODY ENJOYING THAT I AM ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
IN FAVOUR OF 
THE CONSTABULARY 
INSISTS THE CAMERA WILL BE USED 
SENSITIVELY 
THE ASPECT IS NOT TO SENSITIVELY USE IT ON THE BODY OF THE HEATH BUT 
IN THOSE FORMAL AREAS THE MAIN 
GATEWAYS INTO THE HEATHS WHERE IF 
ANYTHING IS COME TO HAPPEN THAT IS 
NORMALLY WEAR IT IS 
NO MATTER WHAT 
THE SAFEGUARDS ANY SIGN OF THE 
CITY ENCROACHING ON THE HEATH WILL 
BE SEEN BY SOME PEOPLE AS AN 
INVASION INVASION AS YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE STRONG 
FEELINGS ON BOTH SIDES THE HEATH 
CONSTABULARY ARE SAYING THEY WOULD 
NEVER USE THIS SYSTEM FOR COVERT 
SURVEILLANCE WHENEVER IT IS USED 
IT WILL BE CLEARLY MARKED THAT 
WILL NOT SATISFY REGULAR USERS WHO 
SEE ANY C. C. T. V. COMING HERE AS 
SOMETHING OF AN INVASION 
AN INQUIRY HAS BEGUN INTO HOW 
FOUR YEAR OLD BOY WENT MISSING FROM 
HIS SCHOOL AND WALKED HALF A MILE 
DOWN A BUSY MAIN ROAD WITHOUT BEING 
STOPPED ROMEO HALL DISAPPEARED AT 
HOME TIME LAST FRIDAY IN HENDON 
WHEN HIS MOTHER WAS TWENTY MINUTES LATE 
TO PICK HIM UP 
SHE IS KEEPING TIGHT HOLD OF HIM 
NOW BUT WHEN ANDREA HALL WAS LATE 
IN PICKING HER FOUR YEAR OLD SON 
ROMEO UP FROM SCHOOL LAST FRIDAY 
THE LAST THING SHE EXPECTED WAS FOR 
HIM TO HAVE DISAPPEARED 
I WAS TWENTY 
MINUTES LATE BUT MY SON SHOULD 
STILL BE ON THE PREMISES HE SHOULD 
STILL BE IN THE BUILDING OF THAT 
SCHOOL I WAS NOT AN HOUR OR HALF 
AN HOUR LATE HE SHOULD STILL BE ON 
THE PREMISES OF THAT SCHOOL WITH 
THE HEAD OR MEMBER OF STAFF 
BUT HE 
WASN'T HE HAD WALKED STRAIGHT OUT 
OF THE GATES AT SAINT JOSEPH'S ROMAN 
CATHOLIC INFANT SCHOOL IN HENDON 
AND NOBODY SPOTTED HIM ONCE OUT OF 
THE GATES ROMEO MADE HIS WAY HERE 
THE JUNCTION OF THE A FORTY ONE HE MANAGED 
TO GET ACROSS TWO SETS OF TROUBLE 
CARRIAGEWAYS ONCE ON THE OTHER 
SIDE OF THE ROAD HE HEADED 
DOWNWARDS DOWNHILL A QUARTER OF 
A MILE DOWN THE ROAD THE FOUR 
YEAR OLD MANAGES TO CROSS BACK OVER 
THE A FORTY ONE HE GOES PAST HENDON 
CENTRAL TUBE STATION AND PAST THE 
GYM BUT STILL NOBODY STOPS HIM 
UNTIL HE GETS HERE A GOOD HALF 
MILE FROM HIS ORIGINAL STARTING 
POINT HE IS ONLY STOPPED BECAUSE A 
PASSER BY PREVENTS HIM FROM RUNNING 
BACK TOWARDS THE TRAFFIC AT THAT 
POINT THE POLICE ARE CALLED THIS 
AFTERNOON AT SAINT JOSEPH'S NONE OF 
THE PARENTS WERE AWARE OF WHAT HAD 
HAPPENED 
WE BELIEVE THAT THE HAPPENED CHILDREN ARE IN GOOD CARE YOU KNOW 
AND WE EXPECT THINGS TO BE THAT WAY 
SO IT IS REALLY OUT OF ORDER 
IT IS 
A BIT SCARY L. HAVE NEVER KNOWN 
THAT BEFORE 
NO ONE WAS AVAILABLE 
FOR INTERVIEW AT SAINT JOSEPH'S BUT 
THEY DID CONFIRM ROMEO WENT MISSING 
ON FRIDAY BUT ONE GOVERNOR AND A 
PARENT WAS HAPPY TO TALK 
IT IS A 
WORRYING THOUGHT AND THEY SHOULD BE 
MORE IN PLACE TO MAKE KIDS SAFE 
COMING OUT OF SCHOOL THIS THIS AFTERNOON A REUNION FOR ROMEO AND 
THE MAN WHO RESCUED HIM 
IT WAS A 
SHOCK TO MY SYSTEM TO BE HONEST 
IT TOOK A COUPLE OF MINUTES FOR ME 
TO CATCH ON WHAT 
WAS HAPPENING L. WAS PARKING MY CAR GOING TO THE 
GYM AND A LOOK ROUND AND THERE WAS 
A BOY COMING DOWN THE ROAD WHILE WHILE AN INQUIRY BEGINS AT THE SCHOOL 
THE LITTLE BOY AT THE CENTRE OF IT 
ALL IS UNAWARE OF WHAT HE HAS DONE 
SAY THANK YOU TO BRYAN ROMEO 
STAY WITH US STILL TO COME NEARLY 
TWO YEARS AFTER A DEVASTATING HEAVE 
FIRE I WILL LOOK AT HOW THIS 
SCORCHED EARTH IN SURREY IS 
STARTING TO LOOK GREEN AGAIN 
THE MAN WHO RAN HEATHROW AIRPORT 
DURING TERMINAL FIVE'S DISASTROUS 
OPENING IS STEPPING DOWN B. A. A. SAID 
MARK BULLOCK HAD CHOSEN TO LEAVE 
HIS POST AS MANAGING DIRECTOR HIS 
DEPARTURE COMES WEEKS AFTER 
HUNDREDS OF FLIGHTS AND THOUSANDS 
OF BAGS WENT MISSING AT THE NEW 
MULTI MILLION POUND TERMINAL MARC 
ASHDOWN IS AT HEATHROW HOW 
SIGNIFICANT IS TODAY'S 
ANNOUNCEMENT 
VERY SIGNIFICANT FEW ANNOUNCEMENT CAN FORGET BEEF FIASCO FIASCO 
THAT HAPPENED HERE AT TERMINAL FIVE A 
MONTH OR SO AGO WHEN THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE'S LUGGAGE WAS LAST DONE 
THOUSANDS OF HOLIDAYS RUINED AS A 
RESULT I SUPPOSE IT WAS INEVITABLE 
THAT WE CAN EXPECT THE PARTIES OF A 
DIFFERENT NATURE AS A RESULT AS 
YOU SAY MARK BULLOCK THE MANAGING 
DIRECTOR THE MAN RESPONSIBLE AS 
FAR AS B. A. A. WAS CONCERNED HAS 
STEPPED DOWN THE OFFICIAL LINE IS 
THAT HE HAS CHOSEN TO LEAVE BUT 
MANY IN THE INDUSTRY ARE VIEWING 
THIS AS THE TOP MANAGEMENT TRYING 
TO DRAW A LINE OVER THE WHOLE SORRY 
AFFAIR AND MOVE ON SOMETHING 
BRITISH AIRWAYS DID ALMOST 
IMMEDIATELY THEY PARTED COMPANY 
WITH TWO MEN 
THIS WILL MEAN ARRIVALS AS WELL A 
MAN NAMED MIKE BROWN WHO UNTIL NOW 
HAS BEEN WORKING FOR LONDON 
UNDERGROUND FOR THE PAST EIGHTEEN YEARS 
IS NOW THE MAN TO TAKE UP THE REINS 
FOR B. A. A. AT HEATHROW ONE PERSON I 
HAVE BEEN TALKING TO SAYS THAT HE 
IS JUST THE MAN THAT THEY NEED 
WITH HIS BACKGROUND 
B. A. A. HAS TO TRY 
TO PUT THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND PLACE 
SO THAT THE AIRPORT BECOMES MORE 
EFFECTIVE MORE EFFICIENT AND IN 
THESE DAYS OF GLOBAL TRAVEL CAN 
TAKE ON SOME OF THE EUROPEAN 
COMPETITORS THAT AT THE MOMENT 
ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN HEATHROW 
IT IS SAFE TO SAY A HUGE HIKE 
TASK AHEAD FOR MIKE BROWN 
IF IT 
CERTAINLY IS HE WILL OBVIOUSLY 
HAVE THE REQUISITE SKILLS TO DEAL 
WITH IT LONDON UNDERGROUND CARRIES 
A BILLION PASSENGERS PER YEAR HE 
WILL BE ACUTELY AWARE OF THE NEED 
TO IT INSTILL PUBLIC CONFIDENCE 
FEW CAN FORGET THE SCENES WE SAW OF 
PEOPLE QUEUING ROUND THE BLOCK 
BRITISH AIRWAYS WILL BE FACING IN 
THEIR LONG HAUL FLIGHTS TO TERMINAL 
FIVE IN THE SUMMER SO HE WILL WANT TO 
SHOW WHAT THE PLAYERS CAN DO HE 
WILL HOPEFULLY HAVE NO PROBLEMS 
LIKE WE SAW A MONTH OR SO AGO 
IT WAS A BLAZE THAT BURNED FOR A 
WEEK AND DESTROYED SOME OF SURREY'S 
MOST BEAUTIFUL HEATHLAND TWO YEARS 
ON THE PLANTS ARE GROWING AGAIN 
AND WILDLIFE IS RETURNING WE SPENT 
THE DAY ON THURSLEY COMMON TO FIND 
OUT HOW THE AREA HAS BEEN RESTORED 
AND WHAT IS IN PLACE TO PREVENT IT 
HAPPENING AGAIN 
COMING BACK TO LIVE NEARLY TWO 
YEARS AGO THIS LAND WAS BLACK AND 
BURNED BACK TO LIFE 
IT BECAME 
PRETTY IMPOVERISHED WASTELAND 
ANYTHING THAT REQUIRED ANY HEIGHT 
IN THE VEGETATION SOME OF THEIR 
GROUND NESTING BIRDS SUFFERED LOTS 
OF OUR WARBLERS A VERY RARE A 
PROTECTED BIRD LOTS OF THEIR SIDES 
WERE LEFT TO DESTROY IT 
IN JULY 
TWO THOUSAND SIX A HEATH FIRE DAMAGED OVER 
TWO THIRDS OF THURSLEY COMMON 
NATIONAL NATURE RESERVE IN SURREY 
FIREFIGHTERS WERE YEAR FOR EIGHT 
DAYS PUTTING IT OUT 
WHERE NOW 
SEEING THE REGENERATION WE WERE 
HOPING FOR WE ARE NOW WE HAVE 
REGENERATION GOING ON OUR HEATHERS 
ARE STARTING TO COME THROUGH WE 
ARE SO PLEASED TO SEE THE SCREEN 
STARTING TO RESURFACE 
THAT IS GOOD 
NEWS FOR THE ADDERS BEETLES AND 
SAND LIZARD THAT LIVE HERE A FULL 
RECOVERY MAY TAKE TEN YEARS AND 
THAT'S MAY TAKE TEN YEARS THERE 
IS BRACKEN IS AN AGGRESSIVE AND 
INVASIVE PART NOT CONSIDERED 
WILDLIFE RICH LIKE THE HEATWAVE 
LAST SUMMER'S EFFORTS TO HAVE THIS 
CLEAR IT HAD TO BE CANCELLED 
BECAUSE OF THE FOOT AND MOUTH 
OUTBREAK IN THE AREA AFTER TWO 
DIFFICULT SUMMERS HE IS TO A QUIET 
ONE THAT MEANS MEMBERS OF THE 
PUBLIC DOING THEIR BIT 
HERE'S TO 
WE'RE SEEING THE FIRST GOOD WEATHER 
OF THE YEAR THAT BRINGS PEOPLE OUT 
IT CAN BRING THEM WALKING 
OCCASIONALLY THEY ARE CARELESS WITH 
CIGARETTES CAMPFIRES ETC WHICH IS 
WHERE OUR PROBLEMS BEGIN 
WE HAVE 
GOT OVER THE EMOTIONAL SHOCK OF 
SEEING A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT THAT 
EVERYONE WHO WORKS HERE AND KNOWS 
IT LOVE TO DELETE SEEING IT GO UP 
IN SMOKE WE ARE STARTING THE 
PROCESS OF RECOVERY LOVE TO 
DELAY 
IT HAS BEEN DAMAGED AND HIS DELAY SCARRED BUT IT IS STILL FULL OF 
LIFE IS SCARRED 
HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO PREVENT A 
SKYSCRAPER BEEN BUILT IN YOUR 
NEIGHBOURHOOD SHOREDITCH 
CAMPAIGNERS SAY THEY ARE PREPARED 
TO DECLARE INDEPENDENCE FROM THE 
REST OF LONDON IF THAT'S WHAT IT 
TAKES TO STOP A DEVELOPMENT HIGH 
STREET THEY BELIEVE THEY HAVE AN 
ANCIENT LAW ON THEIR SIDE 
PASSPORT READY PLEASE 
THE EALING 
COMEDY PASSPORT TO PIMLICO 
PRESIDENTS SET UP AN INDEPENDENT 
STATE IN S. W. ONE NOW A REAL LIFE 
CAST OF CAMPAIGNERS IN SHOREDITCH 
IS HOPING TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR 
THEY WANT TO STOP DEVELOPERS 
BULLDOZING A FORMER VICTORIAN POWER 
STATION ON THE HIGH STREET 
WE WERE 
FURBISH THIS LOVINGLY WITH THE HELP 
OF ENGLISH HERITAGE WE 
REFURBISHED THIS WE SPENT LOTS OF 
MONEY WON IT AND BELIEVE WE HAVE 
DONE A VERY GOOD JOB WE BELIEVE A 
BUILDING LIKE THIS SHOULD REMAIN 
IT WAS HERE AMONG THE SHELVES OF 
THE GUILDHALL LIBRARY THAT CAMPAIGN 
HAS STUMBLED ACROSS A POSSIBLE 
LOOPHOLE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY MAPS 
APPEARED TO SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED 
DEVELOPMENT FALLS WITHIN AN AREA 
ONCE KNOWN AS THE NORTON FOLGATE 
LIBERTY IN OTHER WORDS EVEN 
BEFORE THE NORMAN CONQUEST THE 
AREA OF AROUND TEN ACRES WAS A FREE 
STATE OUTSIDE THE CITY OF LONDON 
WALLS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY 
OUTSIDE OF ITS LAWS 
THE ROAD 
BEHIND US WAS NOTORIOUS FOR 
PROSTITUTES STABBINGS AND BRAWLS 
WITHIN CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE BEN 
JONSON AND SHAKESPEARE LIVED HERE 
WE THINK THE REASON THAT PEOPLE 
OF SHOREDITCH AND SPITTLES FEELS 
NOW IS THAT IT WAS A GOOD PLACE TO 
DRINK CHEAP OUTSIDE THE THIRTY 
CITY WALLS BE ON THE ROLE OF THE 
CHURCH 
CAMPAIGNERS HAVE INSTRUCTED CHURCH LAWYERS TO LOOK AT WHETHER THE 
SPIRIT OF INDEPENDENCE CAN BE 
EVOKED TODAY 
WE WANT TO 
DEMONSTRATE THAT WHEN IT WAS 
DISSOLVED IN NINETEEN HUNDRED ASPECTS OF ITS 
LAWS AND INDEPENDENCE SURVIVED IT 
OUGHT TO BE GIVEN THE POWERS TO 
GOVERN ITSELF AGAIN IT DOES NOT 
WANT WHAT IS BEING IMPOSED UPON IT 
BY GREAT OUTSIDE FORCES YOU SHOULD 
FIGHT THEM 
THEIR OPPONENTS ARE 
LIKELY TO FIGHT BACK DEVELOPERS 
SOME ARE SPENDING HUNDREDS OF 
MILLIONS OF POUNDS ON THIS PROJECT 
WHICH WOULD INCLUDE OFFICES FLATS 
AND A HOTEL IF THE RESIDENTS OF 
NORTON FOLGATE HAVE A CASE IT 
COULD SET A PRECEDENT FOR OTHER 
LIBERTIES ACROSS THE CAPITAL
