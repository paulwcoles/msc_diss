THANK YOU 
THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH 
HELLO AND WELCOME 
AS ALWAYS WE'VE BORROWED THE KEYS TO TWO FASCINATING HOMES 
BELONGING TO TWO FASCINATING CELEBRITIES 
WITHOUT FURTHER ADO LET'S JOIN OUR OWN SUPER SLEUTH LISA SNOWDON 
FOR IT IS SHE AND FIND OUT WHAT'S IN STORE FOR US TODAY LISA 
IF YOU WANT TO GET AHEAD THERE'S NO POINT TIPTOEING AROUND 
YOU'VE GOT TO PUT BEST FOOT FORWARD 
STEP OUT IN CONFIDENCE AND JUST HOPE YOUR PARTNER IS UP TO IT 
LEAD AND LET OTHERS FOLLOW 
IT'S A FAMILY AFFAIR FOR THIS PERSON BUT WHAT FAMILY 
COULD IT BE A HOLLYWOOD DYNASTY OR SOMETHING CLOSER TO HOME 
EITHER WAY UNIONS COULD PROVE INTERESTING 
THE CLUES ARE ALL THERE BUT WHO IS PLAYING THE GAME TODAY 
WELL PLAYING THE GAME TODAY IS OUR PANEL 
AND WHAT A PANEL THEY ARE 
THEY'RE LIKE VENUES FOR THE LONDON OLYMPICS 
YOU WONDER IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE READY ON TIME 
OUR FIRST PANELLIST IS THE MAN WHO ONCE SAID VELCRO WHAT A RIP OFF 
HE ALSO SAID EXIT SIGNS THEY'RE ON THE WAY OUT AREN'T THEY 
YEAH 
HOW RIGHT YOU ARE MR. PERKINS IN THE FRONT ROW THERE 
IT'S THAT DELIGHTFUL COMEDIAN TIM VINE 
A MUCH TRAVELLED JOURNALIST OUR NEXT PANELLIST RECENTLY BOUGHT A TICKET TO FRANCE 
THE BOOKING CLERK SAID EUROSTAR SHE REPLIED 
WELL I'VE BEEN ON THE TELLY A FEW TIMES 
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I'D GO THAT FAR 
IT'S THE EVER MODEST EVE POLLARD 
AND OUR THIRD PANELLIST SAYS HE'S A SELF MADE MAN 
IT'S GOOD OF HIM TO TAKE THE BLAME 
FROM OPEN HOUSE WILL YOU WELCOME KRISTIAN DIGBY 
WELL NOW HOW DO WE PLAY THE GAME 
WELL OUR INTREPID HOUSE DETECTIVE LISA SNOWDON 
WILL INVESTIGATE CELEBRITY HOMES 
UNEARTHING VITAL CLUES THAT WILL ENABLE OUR PANEL TO PLAY SHERLOCK 
TO HER HOLMES AND IDENTIFY JUST WHOSE HOUSE IT IS 
SO LET'S JOIN LISA AT HOUSE NUMBER ONE 
AND REMEMBER WATCH CLOSELY 
BECAUSE THE CLUES ARE THERE AS WE GO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
NOW I'M IN READING IN A BRAND SPANKING NEW HOUSE ON A NEW ESTATE 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE PERSON WHO LIVES HERE HAS ONLY JUST MOVED IN 
SO THEY HAVEN'T HAD MUCH TIME TO STAMP THEIR STYLE ON THE PLACE 
BUT I THINK IF I GET THE CHOREOGRAPHY RIGHT 
I'LL BE ABLE TO LEAD YOU TO THE IDENTITY OF THIS PERSON 
MINIMALIST I WOULD SAY 
BUT THE FEW THINGS THAT ARE IN HERE ARE VIBRANT DYNAMIC AND UNIQUE 
THE ROOM IS DOMINATED BY THIS PAINTING 
DONE BY A CHAP CALLED NESHINKA 
I JUST LOVE THAT THE WAY THE COLOURS SWIRL AND DANCE TOGETHER 
AGAINST THE DYNAMIC RED BACKGROUND 
NOW THE FEW PIECES THAT ARE HERE ARE QUITE DISTINCT 
THIS PIECE HAS BEEN SPECIALLY COMMISSIONED 
BY THE LEADING GLASS ARTIST AMANDA BRISBANE 
IT'S VERY DRAMATIC BEAUTIFULLY UNSTRUCTURED 
AND AGAIN FULL OF MOVEMENT 
THE FURNITURE IS NICE AND SOLID 
A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF AMERICAN WALNUT STURDY AND SOLID 
IF YOU HAD A MIND TO JUMP ON IT AND DANCE THE LIGHT FANTASTIC 
AFTER TOO MANY BEVERAGES WHICH IS WHAT I'VE DONE ALLEGEDLY 
ALTHOUGH I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION WHATSOEVER 
BUT I THINK YOU'D BE PRETTY SAFE TO DO SO 
NOW I JUST LOVE IT WHEN OUR GUESTS LEAVE US CLUES OUT 
BUT THESE JUST A LITTLE TOO OBVIOUS 
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THIS PERSON IS FIT 
A WHOLE TUB OF WHEY 
AND IN THE FRIDGE 
A WHOLE PHALANX OF HEALTHY JUICES 
AND LOTS AND LOTS OF FRESH FRUIT 
NOW THE ONE THING I CAN TELL ABOUT THIS PERSON IS THEY LIKE THINGS SIMPLE AND NEUTRAL 
LIKE THE COLOUR IN THIS BEDROOM DOMINATED BY WHITE 
AND THEN THIS RICH DARK WOODEN HEADBOARD 
HOWEVER THEY DO LIKE TO MAKE A STATEMENT 
WITH BRIGHT COLOURFUL FLASHES OF BRILLIANCE 
LIKE THIS 
NOW I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE TYPE OF GEAR 
THAT YOU WEAR TO POP DOWN TO YOUR LOCAL CHIPPY FOR COD AND CHIPS 
A PICKLED EGG AND TWO SLICES OF BREAD WITH BUTTER PLEASE 
NO THIS IS THE KIND OF GEAR THAT WHEN YOU WEAR IT YOU WEAR IT WELL 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CLUES AGAIN 
THE SPARKLY SHIRT THE HEALTHY LIVING AND THE FLAMBOYANT ART 
WHO LIVES IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
DAVID IT'S OVER TO YOU 
WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LISA 
NOW FOR OUR HOME AND STUDIO AUDIENCE HERE'S WHOSE HOUSE IT IS 
TIM WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNT SO FAR 
I THINK HE I'M SAYING HE I THINK HE COULD BE A BIT OF A SHOW OFF 
I SAY THAT BECAUSE THERE IS AN EXTRAVAGANCE ABOUT THE HOUSE 
THESE GLITTERY SHIRTS AND THE ARTISTIC WELL IT LOOKED LIKE 
THAT'S ART TO SOME PEOPLE IT LOOKED LIKE HE'D THROWN A COUPLE OF MEALS AT THE WALL ACTUALLY 
I WOULD SAY IT'S SOMEONE IN THE ARTS ANYWAY 
IT'S SOME FORM OF ARTISTIC ENDEAVOUR 
I THINK THAT'S BASICALLY RIGHT YES I THINK THAT'S BASICALLY RIGHT EVE 
I'VE THOUGHT THIS WAS DEFINITELY A MAN AND A SHOW OFF 
BECAUSE IT HAD MIRRORS ABOVE THE BED HEAD 
THAT'S DEFINITELY A SIGN OF A SHOW OFF I WON'T GO ANY FURTHER 
BUT HISTORY HAS SHOWN THAT TO BE TRUE 
AND WHOEVER IT IS HAS GOT A VERY GOOD DAILY BECAUSE IT'S TERRIBLY TERRIBLY CLEAN 
SOMEBODY WHO PROBABLY DOES QUITE A LOT OF TELEVISION WOULD YOU SAY 
I THINK I THINK WE'D HAVE TO ADMIT TO THAT DIGBY 
THE MIRRORS WERE INTERESTING 
THE LAST TIME I WENT TO A HOUSE WITH MIRRORS LIKE THAT DON'T TELL US 
WAS P. P. P. PETER STRINGFELLOW BUT IT'S NOT HIS HOME 
IS IT MORE TELEVISION THAN THEATRE 
YES YES O. K. 
YES IT'S INTERESTING YOU MENTION THE MIRRORS 
I WAS GOING TO MENTION THEM AND THEN I THOUGHT ON REFLECTION 
I SHOULDN'T 
BUT I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING WE ARE PROBABLY ALL IT STRUCK US ALL WHEN WE SAW IT 
WAS WHEN SHE POINTED TO A BOOK WITH SOMEONE DANCING ON FRONT AND SAID TOO OBVIOUS 
SO I SUPPOSE IT MIGHT BE A BIT OBVIOUS TO SAY IS THIS PERSON A DANCER 
BUT IN THIS DAY AND AGE 
PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE TRAINED AS DANCERS CAN DO ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS AS WELL 
SO THEY MAY BE FAMOUS FOR DOING OTHER THINGS AS WELL EVE 
WOULD THIS PERSON BE A DANCER BUT A CHOREOGRAPHER AS WELL 
YES YES 
SO THEY ARE BIG STUFF IN THE WORLD OF DANCING 
DOES THAT HAVE ANY CONNECTION TO ANYTHING EXCEPT MONEY 
LISA'S BEING PAID BY THE AMERICAN WALNUT ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA 
I'M NOT SURE OF THE DETAILS OF THAT TRANSACTION 
I SEE 
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE NOT SAYING IT'S ANYBODY WHO'S AN AMERICAN NO 
SHE'S A VERY MISLEADING GIRL THEN 
IN TERMS OF DANCING IF WE'RE GOING DOWN THAT ROUTE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY ONE MAJOR SHOW AT THE FOREFRONT 
YOU SHOULD KNOW BECAUSE YOUR DAUGHTER PRESENTS PART OF IT 
AH I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT 
STRICTLY COME DANCING 
SO IS THIS A JUDGE 
WEARING THAT SEQUIN TOP 
NOT A JUDGE 
CONTROVERSIALLY YOU THINK THAT DANCERS 
IS HE QUITE A MASCULINE DANCER 
EVEN THOUGH HE'S A MAN STILL KIND OF BUTCH AND GRRR NO 
NO 
APPARENTLY NOT 
YES NO YES SOMEONE'S DOING THAT 
DANCERS IN GENERAL OR THIS DANCER YOU MEAN 
IS HE STILL QUITE A MAN'S MAN KIND OF RAH 
OH YEAH I THINK SO YES 
AND HE GOT TALL VERY LATE IN LIFE FUNNILY ENOUGH 
WHAT ROUNDABOUT HIS TEENS 
DID HE DO IT FOR TELEVISION IF YOU KNOW ANY DANCER WHO GOT TALL LATER IN LIFE 
WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR WAYNE SLEEP TO SHOOT UP 
IS HE IS HE TALL AND BLONDE 
AND HIS SURNAME IS WAITE 
YES 
AND HIS FIRST NAME IS I DON'T KNOW 
I HAD NO IDEA HE DANCED BUT TERRY WAITE HOW AMAZING 
COME OUT TERRY 
HERE COMES TERRY NOW 
ON THOSE LITTLE TIPPY TOES OF HIS 
WE ALL KNOW TERRY'S TIPPY TOES 
DO WE KNOW MR. WAITE'S FIRST NAME 
YOU GOT THERE FIRST YOU GO ON 
WE'LL SHARE NO IT'S YOURS 
IAN YES 
IAN AND TERRY WAITE WILL YOU COME THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
WELCOME VERY GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US THANK YOU 
EVERYONE GIVING YOU A WARM WELCOME THERE 
YOU'VE DONE ALL THE SERIES OF STRICTLY COME DANCING FROM NUMBER TWO HAVEN'T YOU 
YES FROM SERIES TWO I WAS IN THE SHOW AND IN FACT 
WHEN I STARTED THE SERIES I KIND OF THOUGHT 
I WONDER WHAT THE SHOW'S GOING TO BE LIKE I DIDN'T KNOW THE SHOW 
I LIVED IN HOLLAND RIGHT UP UNTIL I STARTED THE SERIES 
AND HOW DID YOU ACTUALLY GET TALENT SPOTTED FOR THE SERIES 
I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO KNOW CAMILLA FOR A LONG TIME 
CAMILLA WAS ON SERIES ONE 
SHE PHONED ME UP DIRECTLY AFTER THE FIRST SERIES AND SAID WOULD 
WE FORMED A PARTNERSHIP AND THAT WAS MY INTRODUCTION TO THE B. B. C. 
AND THE SECOND SERIES OF STRICTLY 
IT'S BEEN A FANTASTIC JOURNEY AND WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED 
THAT A BALLROOM DANCE SHOW WOULD TAKE OFF LIKE THAT AND BE SO SUCCESSFUL 
NO ONE WOULD HAVE PREDICTED IT 
THEY THOUGHT THE ORIGINAL COME DANCING WAS LOVELY IN ITS DAY BUT THAT WAS IT 
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 
NOW THAT HOUSE IS NOT IN HOLLAND IS IT THAT'S YOUR HOME HERE 
THAT'S MY HOME HERE BUT I ONLY MOVED IN SIX MONTHS AGO AND I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN THERE VERY MUCH 
I'VE BEEN THERE PROBABLY I THINK YOUR CAMERA CREW HAVE BEEN THERE LONGER THAN ME 
I MOVED IN AND THEN SERIES FIVE STARTED AND THEN WE'VE BEEN ON TOUR 
WITH THE STRICTLY COME DANCING LIVE TOUR 
ONE THING THAT CAUGHT THE EYE CAUGHT LISA'S EYE AND CAUGHT MY EYE 
AND EVERYONE ELSE'S EYE WAS GENE KELLY THERE 
THE BOOK ABOUT GENE KELLY 
DOES THAT BESPEAK NOT ONLY A HERO OF YOURS BUT SOMEONE YOU'D LIKE TO EMULATE 
HE WAS AN ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION TO ME 
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A YOUNG BOY AND MY GRAN USED TO WATCH THESE OLD MOVIES ALL THE TIME 
GENE KELLY STOOD OUT FOR ME 
I REMEMBER WATCHING ANCHORS AWEIGH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
MY GRAN SAID THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO BE 
SHE DIDN'T SAY A DANCER SHE SAID YOU WANT TO BE A SAILOR 
AND TRAVEL THE WORLD 
AND I KIND OF BECAME SECOND BEST TO THAT 
IN THAT I BECAME A DANCER AND TRAVELLED THE WORLD 
BUT FOR ME THAT WAS WHAT I LOVED TO DO AND THOSE OLD MOVIES 
REALLY EPITOMISED EVERYTHING THAT I WANTED TO BE 
AND SINGING IN THE RAIN HE WAS FANTASTIC IN THAT TOO 
OH ABSOLUTELY THE CLASSICS LIKE THAT AND ANCHORS AWEIGH AND ON THE TOWN 
WHAT IN THE END IT IS THE SECRET THE INCREDIBLE SECRET OF THE SUCCESS 
OF STRICTLY COME DANCING 
WHAT'S MADE IT A NATIONAL DRUG 
IT DOES REACH OUT TO A WHOLE FAMILY AUDIENCE I THINK THAT'S THE KEY 
THE WHOLE FAMILY CAN SIT DOWN TOGETHER AND WATCH THE SAME SHOW 
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE WE'VE HAD THAT 
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT THAT BALLROOM DANCING 
WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY WANTED TO WATCH AND BE INVOLVED WITH 
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED IT AND I WAS ALWAYS A BIT ODD WHEN I WAS YOUNGER 
AT SCHOOL I REALLY FELT I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL ANYBODY 
BECAUSE IT WAS SOMETHING THAT NOBODY REALLY DID ANYMORE 
IT WAS AN OLD PASTIME 
SO FOR IT TO BE COOL AND HIP NOW 
YOU KNOW 
FINALLY I'M COOL AND HIP AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS 
BET YOU'RE GLAD YOU RESISTED ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE WANTED YOU TO DO 
I DID START OFF PLAYING RUGBY AND I WAS IN THE FOOTBALL TEAM AT SCHOOL 
THE DANCING WAS MY THING AND I WAS ALSO AT SCHOOL KNOWN AS AN ARTIST 
HENCE THE ARTWORK THAT YOU SAW 
I'VE QUITE A FEW PIECES OF ARTWORK WHICH I LOVE 
I LOVE MODERN ART AND I LOVE TO HAVE INVOLVEMENT IN THAT 
WELL WE'RE DELIGHTED YOU DID TAKE UP DANCING 
KEEP ON ENTERTAINING US A MILLION THANKS AND OUR CONGRATULATIONS 
IAN HERE IS THE SYMBOL THE SYMBOL OF WHAT YOU'VE ACHIEVED 
THE INVALUABLE THROUGH THE KEYHOLE KEY 
INSURE IT IMMEDIATELY 
YES I WILL OUR THANKS TO IAN WAITE 
IAN WAITE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
IAN WAITE 
AND NOW LET'S JOIN LISA AGAIN AT HOUSE NUMBER TWO 
AND WATCH CLOSELY THE CLUES ARE THERE AS WE GO THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
I'M IN THE COTSWOLDS IN A HUGE COUNTRY PILE WITH DOZENS OF ROOMS 
THE OLDEST PART OF THIS HOUSE DATES BACK TO THE SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS 
I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT THE SAME DYNASTY HAS OWNED THIS HOUSE FOR CENTURIES BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE 
HOWEVER THIS IS STILL A FAMILY HOME 
I THOUGHT I COULD SMELL WOODSMOKE AS I CAME THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR 
AND SURE ENOUGH A LOG FIRE BURNING 
IN THIS ENORMOUS AND REALLY RATHER ANCIENT FIREPLACE 
I JUST LOVE THE HISTORY OF OLD HOUSES LIKE THIS 
I CAN IMAGINE MANY A FAMILY DRAMA PLAYED OUT IN THIS ROOM OVER THE YEARS 
THE HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD WARMING HIS AMPLE BACKSIDE AT THE FIREPLACE 
WHILST PLOTTING AND SCHEMING TO INCREASE THE FAMILY FORTUNE 
AND SECURE THE FUTURE FOR GENERATIONS TO COME 
I MEAN I SAY AMPLE BOTTOM 
HE MAY HAVE JUST HAD A NORMAL SIZED BOTTOM 
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW 
BUT WE HAVE TO MOVE INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
NOW THE TELEVISION SITS IN THE CORNER CAPABLE OF BEAMING IN 
PROGRAMMES FROM HOLLYWOOD NEW YORK OR EVEN DENVER 
EVEN THOUGH I'M IN THE COTSWOLDS 
THERE IS A CALIFORNIA CONNECTION ESPECIALLY IN THE READING MATERIAL 
THE SCREENWRITER'S PROBLEM SOLVER THE WRITER'S HANDBOOK 
LEAD US IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SILVER SCREEN AND A WAY WITH WORDS 
AND THERE'S A PRACTICAL ASPECT FOR FILM MAKERS IN THIS BOOK HERE 
THESE ARE THE ORIGINAL BELLS THAT WERE USED TO SUMMON THE SERVANTS 
TO BRING TEA AND CAKES FOR THE IMPORTANT VISITORS 
THEY WERE THE DAYS A TOUCH OF UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS 
WHEN PEOPLE KNEW THEIR PLACE 
THERE'S EVERYTHING TO LOVE ABOUT THIS HOUSE 
FROM THE BEAUTIFUL FLAGSTONES TO THE KITCHEN 
THIS WAS BUILT WHEN KITCHENS WERE THE MAIN FOCUS OF FAMILY LIFE 
I'M COMING IT'S NEVER ENDING 
SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CLUES AGAIN 
THE FAMILY PILE THE CALIFORNIA CONNECTION AND STARLIGHT STAR BRIGHT 
WHO LIVES IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
DAVID IT'S OVER TO YOU 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LISA 
AND NOW FOR OUR HOME AND STUDIO AUDIENCE HERE'S WHOSE HOUSE IT IS 
KRISTIAN IT'S OVER TO YOU 
REALLY OH DEAR 
I'VE MADE A LOT OF NOTES 
I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A LOT 
AND 
O. K. LET'S START WITH IS IT A FILM MAKER I'M GOING TO GO STRAIGHT IN IS THAT A FILM MAKER 
GOOD THAT'S WORKED BRILLIANTLY 
I WAS THINKING THERE WAS MADONNA MUSIC PLAYING 
COULD IT BE SOMETHING TO DO WITH GUY RITCHIE NO 
SO I DO YOU KNOW AT THIS STAGE I'M NOT SURE 
ALL RIGHT THEN WE'LL GO ON TO YOUNG EVE 
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE HOUSE 
WELL FIRST OF ALL I WAS GOING TO SAY WHOEVER LIVES HERE IS VERY CLASSY AND VERY CLASSIC 
AND I FEEL HAS HAD A BIT OF MONEY FOR SOME TIME 
AND SO HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL OVER MANY YEARS 
NOT NECESSARILY MANY BUT QUITE A FEW 
FROM LISA'S COMMENTS ABOUT THIS MAN WARMING HIS AMPLE BACKSIDE 
ARE WE LOOKING FOR A MAN HERE NO 
YOU MAY BE LOOKING FOR A MAN 
OLD HABITS DIE HARD 
BUT THIS IS A WOMAN YES I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE 
I CAN TELL COS A WOMAN HAS GOT EVERYTHING IN THE KITCHEN IN THOSE 
SQUARE SEE THROUGH GLASS THINGS SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S IN THEM 
A MAN WOULD NEVER DO THAT AND VERY NICELY 
WELL NO MAN I KNOW WOULD EVER DO THAT 
AND VERY NICELY COLOUR COORDINATED IF I MAY JUST SAY PINKS AND BLUES 
SO A WOMAN WHO COOKS 
YES AND HAS A DOMESTIC SIDE WHILE OBVIOUSLY BEING VERY CREATIVE 
YES 
TIM 
WELL IT MIGHT BE VERY MISGUIDED BUT I ACTUALLY FEEL SLIGHTLY 
I HAVE A BIT OF CONFIDENCE ABOUT THIS I'M NOT GONNA 
PUT IT THIS WAY IS IT AN ACTRESS 
I WAS CONFIDENT IT WOULD BE 
I'M GLAD YOUR CONFIDENCE HAS NOT BEEN BETRAYED 
THAT'S AS FAR AS I'VE GOT WITH MY CONFIDENCE BUT NO I THINK IT MAY BE SOMEONE 
SOMETHING WAS SAID EARLIER ON THAT SUGGESTS TO ME PERHAPS THAT SHE DID 
QUITE A LOT OF ACTING OR SHE'S MOST WELL KNOWN FOR ACTING IN AMERICA 
I FEEL AS THOUGH THERE WAS A BIG CLUE LOBBED IN EARLIER ON BY LISA 
THE ACTUAL PROGRAMME SHE WAS IN 
SHOULD I VOLUNTEER THAT TO THE GROUP 
YES I THINK THE GROUP DESERVE TO KNOW THAT 
IS IT I THINK YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE UPSTAIRS 
IS IT NO NO I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS 
SHALL I JUST GO WILL THIS MAKE IT EASIER 
I MIGHT GO 
WHAT WERE YOU 
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS AH 
THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF PERIOD DRAMA IN THAT HOUSE TO ME 
LIKE GOSFORD PARK OR UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS 
HE HASN'T BEEN IN MANY OLD HOUSES 
SHALL I TELL YOU THE NAME OF THE SHOW I THINK SHE WAS IN 
GO ON I SAY THIS BECAUSE IF IT'S THE WOMAN I THINK IT IS 
I'M RATHER EXCITED 
COS I USED TO FANCY HER WHEN I WAS YOUNGER 
AND I STILL DO IN FACT IF SHE IS HERE AND YOU'RE STILL YOUNG 
I THINK IT WAS DYNASTY SHE WAS IN 
AND ITS SUCCESSOR PROGRAMME AND ITS SUCCESSOR PROGRAMME 
DYNASTY THE REVENGE 
NO WHAT WAS IT CALLED 
WHAT WAS IT THE ONE WITH STEPHANIE BEACHAM IN IT AS WELL THE COLBYS 
THE COLBYS WAS IT RIGHT IT WASN'T STEPHANIE BEACHAM WAS IT 
NO IT WASN'T 
I DO HAVE A NAME IN MY HEAD 
DO YOU YEAH LET'S GET IT OUT ON THE TABLE O. K. 
EMMA SAMMS 
YES 
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
EMMA SAMMS WILL YOU COME THROUGH THE KEYHOLE 
HELLO 
AND YOU'RE RIGHT SHE'S JUST AS BEAUTIFUL AS EVER ISN'T SHE 
SHE CERTAINLY IS YOU HAD TO SAY THAT COS I MIGHT BE BACK THERE 
THAT ISN'T WHY I SAID IT THANK YOU ANYWAY IT'S A PLEASURE 
AHEM 
ANYWAY SIR DAVID FROST WANTS TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS 
WE CHERISH THOSE SPECIAL MOMENTS FIRST THOUGH WE CHERISH THOSE 
WE WERE TALKING RIGHTLY ABOUT THE COLBYS FOLLOWING DYNASTY 
THAT'S RIGHT YES IN FACT I WENT BACK ONTO DYNASTY AFTER THE COLBYS WAS FINISHED 
THEY DID SOME STORYLINE ABOUT A U. F. O. AND I THINK THE AUDIENCE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT 
PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY THAT WORKING ON MEGA SOAPS AS IT WERE 
THAT THERE'S TERROR 
AMONG THE TEAM AMONG THE ACTORS AND ACTRESSES WHEN ONE OF THEM GETS 
A BAD SORE THROAT THAT THEY MAY BE ABOUT TO GET PNEUMONIA AND DIE 
OR A HEADACHE COULD BE A BRAIN TUMOUR YES 
THE WORST WAS WHEN THEY DID THE MASSACRE IN MOLDAVIA 
I ACTUALLY WASN'T ON THE SHOW AT THAT POINT BUT APPARENTLY THEY ALL HAD TO LIE AROUND ON THE FLOOR 
AND THE PRODUCER CAME AROUND WITH A BOTTLE OF BLOOD 
AND PLACED THE BLOOD ON THEM 
AND THE ONES WHO GOT IT HERE WERE NOT VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT 
DIDN'T LOOK GOOD FOR NEXT SEASON OH NO 
END OF A CAREER BUT IT WAS PROBABLY VERY DIFFERENT 
WHEN YOU GOT INTO THE HOLLYWOOD SCENE AFTER LONDON WAS IT 
I WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN WHEN I WENT OUT THERE 
WERE YOU YES 
SO I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT ANYTHING AT THAT POINT 
I WAS JUST VERY LUCKY 
I DID THE STANDARD ROUTE I WORKED AS A WAITRESS AND THEN HAD A VERY LUCKY BREAK OR TWO OR THREE 
FANTASTIC 
AND THE HOUSE WE SEE NOW THAT'S IN THE COTSWOLDS YEAH IT IS 
AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THAT TWELVE YEARS 
BUT IT'S STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS 
IT PROBABLY ALWAYS WILL BE A WORK IN PROGRESS 
I TRY AND DO ONE ROOM A YEAR FIX THAT UP AND THEN 
BY THE TIME I'M FINISHED I'LL HAVE TO START AGAIN 
AND HOW OLD ARE YOUR CHILDREN NOW 
NINE AND ELEVEN NINE AND ELEVEN BOY AND A GIRL 
GREAT AGES AND THE BELL SYSTEM FOR THE SERVANTS IS A MARVELLOUS DEVICE 
YES UNLESS YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WOULD HAVE TO ANSWER IT COS IT WOULD BE ME 
IF ANYONE RANG THE BELL SO THEY'RE NOT IN WORKING ORDER FOR THAT REASON 
MY CHILDREN WOULD ENJOY THEM VERY MUCH 
BUT LOOKING BACK OVER YOUR CAREER YOU'VE LOVED IT HAVE YOU 
OR HAVE YOU FOUND IT TESTING AT TIMES AS WELL 
BOTH I THINK I'VE LOVED IT AND I'VE LOVED THAT I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT I'VE HAD 
SOMETIMES IT HAS BEEN VERY TESTING 
SOMETIMES THE INTRUSION INTO YOUR PRIVATE LIFE IS TRICKY TO DEAL WITH 
IT'S MUCH BETTER IN ENGLAND 
AND SINCE I'VE SLOWED DOWN TO HAVE MY KIDS IT'S BEEN BETTER 
BUT THE ADVANTAGES OF A CAREER LIKE MINE HAVE BEEN THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO SOMETHING 
LIKE THE STARLIGHT CHILDREN'S FOUNDATION WHICH IS A CHARITY THAT I STARTED A FEW YEARS AGO 
QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO NOW IT'S OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO 
STARLIGHT GRANTS WISHES TO CHILDREN WHO ARE CRITICALLY CHRONICALLY OR TERMINALLY ILL 
AND PROVIDES ENTERTAINMENT FOR THEM IN HOSPITAL 
SO BEING ABLE TO USE ALL MY CONNECTIONS 
I'LL PROBABLY BE ASKING YOU TO SOMETHING AT SOME POINT NOW WE'VE MET 
ABSOLUTELY AND TIM'LL COME TOO 
ABSOLUTELY EVEN IF YOU DON'T ASK ME I'M THERE 
THANK YOU IT'S A MAGIC MOMENT 
AND YOU'RE A PHOTOGRAPHER TOO WE SAW THE THING ON PHOTOGRAPHY AT THE BOTTOM 
TIM SPOTTED THE MAGIC NAME 
YOUR FAMILY NAME SAMUELSON MICHAEL SAMUELSON 
BUT THERE WAS THE THING ON PHOTOGRAPHY AS WELL 
YES I DO WORK AS A PHOTOGRAPHER HOW MUCH OF THAT DO YOU DO A FAIR BIT YES 
I WRITE AND I TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS 
BECAUSE THEY'RE THINGS I CAN SCHEDULE AROUND MY CHILDREN'S SCHEDULE 
WHICH AT THE MOMENT IS THE PRIORITY 
BUT I'VE BEEN TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS AT THE MOMENT FOR A BOOK 
WHICH IS BASED ON THE WORK OF THE CHOREOGRAPHER ROBERT COHAN 
SO I'VE JUST BEEN DOING ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT WORK TO ACTING 
WHICH IS APPROPRIATE 
WOULD YOU BE THRILLED IF YOUR CHILDREN WANTED TO FOLLOW THE SAME PROFESSION 
I'D BE DEVASTATED 
I REALLY WOULD NOT ENCOURAGE ANY CHILD TO GO INTO THAT BUSINESS 
IT'S REALLY TOUGH AND SO MANY TIMES IT'S NOT ABOUT TALENT 
IT'S ABOUT LUCK AND GOOD FORTUNE AND FOR ME IT WAS ABOUT THAT 
PLUS HAVING A GOOD ORTHODONTIST 
THAT'S NOT IDEAL REALLY IT SHOULD BE ABOUT HARD WORK AND EFFORT 
AND TALENT THAT GETS YOU WHERE YOU WANT TO GO TO 
AND I DON'T THINK ACTING IS LIKE THAT 
THAT'S VERY A INTERESTING VIEW ON ACTING THERE 
LOVELY TO SEE YOU 
AND HERE IS THE THROUGH THE KEYHOLE KEY 
THIS IS FOR YOU TO KEEP 
IN THAT VERY LOVELY HOUSE IN THE COTSWOLDS THANK YOU 
OUR THANKS TO EMMA SAMMS AND OF COURSE TO IAN WAITE 
NOT TO MENTION OUR PANEL 
TIM VINE EVE POLLARD AND KRISTIAN DIGBY 
UNTIL THE NEXT TIME GOODBYE FOR NOW
