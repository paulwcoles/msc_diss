AND A GRUBBY SOFA INSIDE 
GUESS WHO MADE THIS MESS YES

WE WENT TO THE PARK FOR A GAME OF FOOTBALL 
DAD AND TOMMY WEREN'T VERY GOOD THE BALL KEPT ROLLING AWAY

I THINK TOMMY LOVES THE PARK MORE THAN I DO 
HE BROUGHT HALF OF IT BACK WITH HIM 
DAD SAID IT WAS TIME TO HAVE A SHOWER AND GET CHANGED 
BUT TOMMY WANTED TO WATCH A FOOTIE MATCH ON T. V. 
I WAS SURE HE'D DO THE RIGHT THING AND GET WASHED FIRST 
PWAH WHAT A PONG AND I WAS WRONG 
TOMMY DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE A SHOWER 
A BIT OF MUD WASN'T GOING TO HURT ANYONE WAS IT 
NOW WHERE WAS THE REMOTE 
THE MATCH WAS KICKING OFF ANY SECOND 
THEN DISASTER STRUCK 
THE SOFA WAS FILTHY

THEY'RE CRAZY THESE UPRIGHTS WE DOGS ALWAYS UNDERSTAND THEM 
BUT THEY HARDLY EVER UNDERSTAND US GET A CLOTH AND CLEAN IT OFF 
GET A CLOTH AND CLEAN IT OFF 
AT LAST
