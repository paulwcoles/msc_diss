HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE ONE SHOW 
WITH DOM LITTLEWOOD AND CHRISTINE 
BLEAKLEY AND TODAY'S GUEST WAS A 
TABLE BOY BANDER THEN GREW UP AS A 
SOLO ARTIST BUT NOW RONAN KEATING 
IS BACK IN THE BOYZONE WELCOME 
RONAN KEATING 
HOW ARE YOU THANK 
YOU 
EXCITEMENT IN THE STUDIO AND YOU OUR VERY OWN NEWS BOY JUSTIN 
ROWLATT IS HERE ALONG WITH 
NORTHERLY FRONT OF CAROL KIRKWOOD 
AND OUR GARDENING GOES DES 
CHRISTINE THEY ARE ALL THERE OVER 
THE NEXT FEW HUNDRED YEARS ALMOST 
ONE HUNDRED BILLION WILL BE SPENT 
ON REGENERATING MANY RUN DOWN TOWNS 
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE FORCED TO 
MAKE WAY FOR THE PROGRESS JUSTIN 
ROWLATT HAS BEEN TO SEE WHAT IS 
LEFT OF A STREET IN TEESSIDE TO 
MEET THE FAMILIES FIGHTING THE 
BULLDOZERS BULLDOZERS MIDDLESBROUGH ONCE A MIGHTY 
INDUSTRIAL TOWN FELL UPON HARD 
TIMES BUT NOW THE TIDE OF 
REGENERATION IS HOPING TO BRING NEW 
LIFE TO ITS BATTERED DOCKLANDS BUT 
THE VISION OF A FUTURE COMES AT A 
PRICE THE LOCAL COUNCIL WANT TO 
BUY AND BULLDOZE THE EXISTING 
HOUSES 
MY CHILDREN WERE BORN HERE HOUSES MY GRANDCHILDREN WERE BORN HERE L. 
THOUGHT I WOULD DIE OVER HERE 
TAKING STAND AGAINST THE 
AUTHORITY ARE THE REMNANTS OF A 
PROUD COMMUNITY THEY ARE FIGHTING 
TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES JUST TWO 
HOUSES REMAIN OCCUPIED ON VINE 
STREET ONE OF THEM 
IS BARBARAS IT IT IS NOT NICE LIVING HERE I CAN TELL 
YOU IT IS NOT NICE IT IS SCARY 
SOMETIMES SOMETIMES BARBARA BELIEVES THE COUNCIL AREN'T 
OFFERING HER FAIR PRICE FOR HER 
HOME SO SHE IS REFUSING TO LEAVE 
IT IS BREAKING MY HEART WATCHING 
THAT BREAKING MY HEART DESPITE DESPITE HER DEFIANCE THE COUNCIL 
DEMOLITION SQUAD HAVE DESTROYED 
ALMOST ALL THE HOMES ON THE ESTATE 
I CAN SEE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT LIVED 
IN THE HOUSES JUST SEE ALL THEIR 
FACES AND THE TIMES WE HAD WHEN WE 
WERE GROWING UP HERE AND IT IS 
JUST WIPED AWAY IT HAS GONE 
BARBARA'S POIGNANT MEMORIES REFLECT 
THE DECLINE OF WHAT WAS ONCE THE 
VERY HEART OF THE TOWN 
FOR ME AS A 
INDUSTRIAL HISTORIAN THIS IS AN 
EXCITING PLACE IT WAS A PORT IT 
HAD RAILWAY CONNECTION IT MADE 
IRON AND STEEL AND SAINT HILDAS IS 
WHERE IT BEGAN THIS WAS THE 
ORIGINAL MIDDLESBROUGH 
SOME DAYS I 
GET SO BAD I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE MY 
HOUSE BAIZE I DON'T WANT TO COME 
OUT AND SEE ALL THIS BECAUSE 
AND BARBARA IS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO 
SHOULD BE WORRIED THE GOVERNMENT 
IS PLANNING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO FORCIBLY PURCHASE HOMES TO MAKE WAY FOR BIG 
DEVELOPMENTS DESPITE THE 
IMPORTANCE OF MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE 
PROJECTS SUCH AS MOTOR WAYS AND 
POWER STATIONS ALARMED HOME OWNERS 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE PREPARING TO 
DEFY THE AUTHORITIES BY REFUSING TO 
BUDGE 
REGENERATION IS DIFFICULT BUDGE BUT IF IT IS DONE WELL ATTRACT NEW 
PEOPLE TO AN AREAS CREATE A VIBRANT 
AREAS CREATE GOOD QUALITY NEW 
HOUSES FOR PEOPLE 
PLANNING EXPERTS 
SAY THE IMPROVEMENTS REGENERATION 
BRINGS SHOULDN'T BE UNDERESTIMATED 
IT CAN CREATE NEW SCHOOL HEALTH 
CENTRE COMMUNITY FACILITIES HAVE 
REAL BENEFIT TO EXISTING PEOPLE IN 
THE COMMUNITY AND NEW PEOPLE MOVING 
THERE THE BEST REGENERATION WORKS 
WITH THE AIMS AND THE ASPIRATIONS 
OF THE EXISTING COMMUNITY THEY ARE 
THE BEDROCK FOR ANY SUCCESSFUL 
REGENERATION SCHEME THE MAN WITH 
THE PLAN MAY BELIEVE SOME FOLK WILL 
NEED TO LOSE OUT TO IMPROVE 
BRITAIN'S TOWNS BUT HE WON'T 
CONVINCE EVERYONE SPECIALLY THE 
DOWTY RESIDENTS OF VINE STREET L. 
AM NOT ASKING FOR ANYONE I DON'T 
DESERVE 
THE COUNCIL SAY THEY HAVE DESERVE OFFERED YOU MARKET PRICE NOW THAT 
IS FAIR NO 
WHY SHOULD YOU GET MORE NO THAN MARKET PRICE 
TWENTY NINE THOUSAND WHAT 
CAN I DO WITH THAT NOTHING AND AND NEIGHBOUR JENNY IS UNIMPRESSED WITH 
HER OFFER TOO 
I AM TRYING TO BE 
POSITIVE AND I AM HOPING THEY WILL 
COME UP WITH SOMETHING DECENT L. 
SEE HEIST IN A NICE HOUSE WITH A 
GARDEN IN A DESIRABLE AREA TO LIVE 
IN TO BE HONEST IF THAT IS ALL 
THEY ARE HAUFRING I WOULD RATHER 
THEY DRAG THE HOUSE ROUND ME NO I 
WON'T LEAVE THEY WILL HAVE TO DRAG 
US OUT 
NO ONE DOUBTS THE DOGGED 
DETERMINATION OF BASH RAND JENNY 
BUT THE COUNCILLOR WHO OVERSEES THE 
REGENERATION PLANS INSISTS THEY ARE 
BEING TREATED FAIRLY 
THE LAST 
PEOPLE TO BE LEFT IN ANY AREA IT IS 
AN APPALLING PLACE TO BE YOU HAVE 
TO REMEMBER THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE MOVED MANY OF WHOM WERE 
DELIGHTED TO MOVE AND MOVED AS 
GRAPHICALLY AS THEY COULD 
UNLESS A 
COMPROMISE CAN BE FOUND THE BATTLE 
OF VINE STREET WILL END THIS IS A 
COMPULSORY PURCHASE ORDER IF ONE 
IS ISSUED RESIDENTS WILL BE FORCED 
TO SELL THEIR HOUSES TO THE LOCAL 
COUNCIL WHETHER THEY WANT TO OR NOT 
THE PROSPECT OF IT BEING EASIER FOR 
TRADITIONAL COMMUNITIES TO BE SWEPT 
AWAY IN THE NAME OF PROGRESS 
WORRIES THIS CHAMPION OF THE 
WORKING CLASSES 
ECONOMICS NEVER 
TAKES INTO ACCOUNT HUMAN COST AND 
THROUGHOUT THE LAST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEAR WHEN 
EVER WE GET H. GRAND REGENERATION 
PROJECTS IT IS WORKING CLASS PEOPLE 
IN NAINDS THAT WILL SO CALLED 
REGENERATED THAT LOSE OUT IT 
SHOULD BE THE LOCAL FOLK WHO DECIDE 
WHAT HAPPEN IF THEY DECIDE LEFT US 
KNOCK IT DOWN FINE BUT WHAT IS 
THE CONSULTATION LET US GET A MORE 
ROUNDED VISION THAN PICK THEM UP 
AND MOVE THEM OUT 
LIKE MANY 
THREATENED HOME OWNERS ACROSS THE 
U. K. BARBARA SIMPLY WILL NOT BE 
MOVED MOVED I HAVE WORKED ALL MY LIFE IN LOW 
PAID JOBS AND I BOUGHT MY HOUSE 
WHY SHOULD I AT FIFTY ODD YEAR OLD GO 
NO I AM NOT DOING IT L. AM 
DEFINITELY NOT DOING IT 
SHE IS NOT 
IS SHE WHAT IS THE UPDATE WITH 
BASH RAND JENNY'S CASE 
THERE IS 
NOTHING TO REPORT IT IS DEADLOCK 
THE COUNCIL ARE OBLIGED BY LAW TO 
PAY MARKET PRICES THEY SAY 
THIRTY THOUSAND IS THE MARKET PRICE AND AS 
YOU HEAR BARBARA SAYS THAT IS NOT 
ENOUGH HER ARGUMENT IS SHE 
COULDN'T BUY ANYTHING LIKE THE 
HOUSE SHE HAS GOT WITH THAT MONEY 
SO SHE IS NOT MOVING 
COMING FROM 
DUBLIN YOU HAVE SEEN REGENERATION 
OVER THE PAST FEW YEAR DO YOU 
THINK IT'S A GOOD OR BAD THING IT IT IS A FANTASTIC THING FOR AN AREA 
BUT IN THIS SCENARIO YOU THINK 
THERE HAS TO BE A HEART WHERE IS 
SHE GOING TO GO SHE WON'T BE ABLE 
TO BUY A HOUSE THAT SIZE AND I 
THINK THEY SHOULD BE BUILDING A 
HOUSE FOR HER SOMEWHERE ELSE YOU 
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT THESE ARE 
HUMAN BEINGS S. 
WHAT ABOUT THE 
CHANGES THE GOVERNMENT ARE PLANNING 
AND WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE DO IF THEY 
ARE ARE UNHAPPY 
THE CHANGES WILL 
MAKE IT EASIER FOR COUNCILS TO 
COMPULSORILY PURCHASE HOUSE THE 
COUNCIL ARE MAKING A CASE FOR 
REGENERATION THEY HAVE TO EXPLAIN 
WHY IT BACKBENCH ON BENEFIT SO IF 
YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT REGENERATION 
YOU SHOULD LOOK AT THE BENEFITS AND 
SEE IF YOU THINK THE COSTS IN TERMS 
OF PEOPLE LIKE BARBARA WHO HAVE TO 
BE MOVED OUT OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS 
IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE A CASE THINK 
ABOUT IT GET AS MANY PEOPLE TO 
SUPPORT AS YOU K. AND THEN PERHAPS 
GO TO THE LOCAL PAPER START A 
CAMPAIGN TO FIGHT THE COUNCIL'S 
PLANS BUT YOU NEED TO DO IT ON THE 
BASIS OF EVIDENCE 
THERE WILL BE A 
LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WILL BE IN THAT 
POSITION A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THAT 
PO IT MEAN IT IS TERRIBLE THERE THERE ARE THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE ROUND 
THE COUNTRY THERE ARE LOTS OF 
REGENERATION PROJECT THERE IS A 
HUGE ONE HERE IN LONDON TO BIELD 
THE OLYMPIC PARK BUT THE PEOPLE 
WHO ARE DEVELOPING THE OLYMPICS SAY 
WE ARE MOVING ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE OUT WE 
ARE BUILDING ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND HOMES AND THAT 
IS THE BALANCE THE COUNCILS WILL 
ARGUE THEY SAY IT WILL BRING 
BENEFIT FOR THE WHOLE COMMUNITY YET 
THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO SUFFER 
GOOD LUCK 
THE SQUEAKY WHEEL GETS 
THE OIL THIS SUNDAY THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH LAUNCH A CAMPAIGN TO ATTRACT 
MORE PEOPLE TO THE PRIESTHOOD IT 
MEANS DIFFERENT FAITHS ARE COMING 
UP WITH UNUSUAL WAYS OF ATTRACTING 
RECRUITS THE ONE SHOW'S CAROL 
KIRKWOOD HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO THE 
CONVERTED IN CARDIFF 
A RELIGIOUS CALLING WAS A TOP THREE 
JOB SECOND ON THE A LIFE IN ARMY OR 
POLITICS BUT DUE TO THE LACK OF 
PRIESTS THE CHURCH WANTS TO 
RECRUIT PEOPLE FROM ANY WALK OF 
LIFE BECAUSE IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS 
IF THE TREND CONTINUES THE CHURCH 
IN WALES WILL REACH A POINT WHERE 
THE NUMBER OF CLERGY RETIRING WILL 
HAVE OUTSTRIPPED THE CHURCH'S 
ABILITY TO REPLACE THEM AND THAT 
MEANS THE CONCERN OF GETTING CHURCH 
GOERS ON TO THEIR SEATS HAS BEEN 
ADDED TO WITH THE WORRY OF GETTING 
PRIESTS INTO THEIR PULPITS 
WE ARE TRYING TO ATTRACT PEOPLE INTO THE CHRISTIAN FAITH WE ARE 
TRYING TO ATTRACT PEOPLE INTO THE 
ORDAINED MINISTRY IN ALL KINDS OF 
WAYS AND MY HOPE IS BY TALKING TO 
PEOPLE BY HAVING IMAGINATIVE 
PRESENTATION OF WHAT THIS JOB AND 
WHAT THE GOSPEL IS ABOUT PEOPLE 
WILL BE ATTRACTED 
AND IT IS A 
PRETTY GOOD DEAL A PRIEST CAN 
EXPECT TO EARN TWENTY ONE THOUSAND A YEAR AND 
NOT ONLY THAT YOU CAN GET YOUR 
LIVING COSTS COVERED A UNIFORM AND 
A FREE WEDDING AND FUNERAL ONLY 
ONE OF EACH PLEASE THROWN IN 
THIS IS MY BODY 
IN EXCHANGE THEY 
WILL BE EXPECTED TO TEACH 
ENCOURAGE AND CARE FOR THOSE WHO 
NEED THEM L. AM GOING TO CATCH UP 
WITH SOME TRAINEES AMONG THIS 
GROUP A FORMER BANKER EX TEACHER 
AND GRADUATE WHAT ABOUT YOU YOU 
HAVE COME INTO THIS A BIT LATER ON 
IN LIFE WHAT LED YOU INTO THIS 
WORK 
AFTER MY HUSBAND DIED 
I KNEW WORK I DIDN'T WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THE 
WORK I HAD DONE BEFORE SO IT WAS A 
QUESTION OF TIME AND WORKING OUT 
WHAT IT WAS I WAS BEING CALLED TO 
DO 
WHAT ABOUT YOURSELF MATTHEW DO YOU WILL BE ORDAINED THIS SUMMER 
THAT IS RIGHT 
DO YOU FEEL YOU HAD 
A VOCATION 
IT IS NOT SOMETHING I 
HAVE ALWAYS HAD L. CAME TO IT LATER 
IN LIFE WHEN I JOINED THE CHURCH AT 
SEVENTEEN IT IS A SATISFYING JOB YOU CAN 
DO PARISH MINISTRY BUT CHAPLAINCY 
WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE ADULTS 
PEOPLE IN PRISON HOPS SO IT IS 
INCREDIBLY VARIED AND FULFILLING 
WHAT ABOUT YOURSELF DAVID WITH ALL 
DUE RESPECT YOU A YOUNG CHAP DO 
YOU THINK YOU WILL HAVE THE SAME 
CREDIBILITY IN THE EYES OF YOUR 
CONGREGATION AS SOME OF YOUR OLDER 
COUNTERPARTS 
ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T COUNTERPARTS HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE THE THING THAT 
TEACHIOUS ABOUT BEING A PRIEST IS 
BEING PRIEST THAT IS HOW YOU 
LEARN TO DO THE JOB AND GAIN MORE 
EXPERIENCE SO THAT IS WHAT I 
BELIEVE AND WHY I AM DOING IT THE THE ARCHBISHOP'S CONCERN IS THAT 
ALTHOUGH THEY MAY HAVE THE RIGHT 
NUMBERS NOW THERE IS A DISTINCT 
LACK OF NEW RECRUITS COMING THROUGH 
THEY HAVE PASSION BUT WHAT THEY 
NEED IS YOUNG BLOOD TO KEEP THE 
CHURCH ALIVE MOODY AND ANGELIC L. 
DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A FORMER 
CONVENT GIRL 
YES A LONG TIME AGO 
WELL BROUGHT UP YOU SEE YOU WERE 
BROUGHT UP IN IRELAND YOU ARE A 
CATHOLIC BOY PRIESTS IN THE 
COMMUNITY ARE THEY AS IMPORTANT AS 
THEY WERE 
THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT 
IN IRELAND AND PROBABLY ACROSS THE 
GLOBE IT IS A HARD SELL SPECIALLY 
SINCE THE CHILD MOLESTATION CHARGES 
THAT CAME ACROSS OVER THE LAST TEN 
YEARS OR SO BUT I THINK THE CHURCH 
NEEDS TO MOVE WITH THIS GENERATION 
THEY NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AND I 
DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO THAT YOU 
LOOK AT THE ARMY THE BRITISH ARMY 
THEY HAVE KIND OF GLAMOURISED IT 
MORE AND BROUGHT IN NEW PEOPLE IN 
BEHIND IT THINKING ABOUT IT 
THINKING OF NEW IDEAS TO GET PEOPLE 
IN AND THE CHURCH NEED TO THINK 
THIS WAY 
FUNNY YOU SHOULD SAY THAT 
BECAUSE THIS IS ONE WAY THAT 
CATHOLIC DIOCESE HAVE COME ONE A 
CALENDAR TO SHOW YOU ALL THE SORTS 
OF THINGS THE PRIEST GET UP TO 
OUTSIDE THE CHURCH A PRIEST IS FOR 
LIFE NOT JUST FOR CHRISTMAS AND 
EASTER I WAS LOOKING THROUGH IT 
IS LIKE A PIN UP FOR PRIESTS THIS 
IS MY FAVOURITE MARCH FATHER NEIL 
BURNS LOOK AT HIM LOOKING RATHER 
COOL RATHER DAPPER AND READING 
CELEBRITY MAGAZINES YOU SEE THAT 
IS THAT IS ALLOWED

GO TO CHURCH I I GO TO CHURCH ALL THE TIME ANY ANY WAY YOU HAVE PERFORMED TWICE IN 
FRONT OF THE POPE 
I WAS LUCKY 
ENOUGH TO DO THAT 
THAT MUST HAVE 
BEEN TERRIFYING 
IT WAS IT WAS 
VERY SCARY BECAUSE GREAT HON MORE

PLACE 
THE CHURCH WAS A BIG PART OF PLACE GROWING UP AND YOU COME ARE FROM A 
STRONG CLOSELY KNIT FAMILY AND

UNUSUAL IN THAT IT HAS PLEASURE

MIGHTS BUT BY DAY SUNSHINE AND 
SHOWERS FOR MOST OF US BRILLIANT BRILLIANT THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW TURNING ON 
YOUR WASHING MACHINE SWITCHING ON 
THE KETTLE AND TUNING ON THE THE 
ONE SHOW ARE THINGS MANY OF US TAKE 
FOR GRANTED BUT SEVENTY YEARS AFTER 
MOST OF THE U. K. WAS HOOKED UP TO 
NATIONAL GRID THE RESIDENTS OF THIS 
REMOTE ISLAND TO THE SOUTH OF THE 
ISLE OF SKYE HAVE FINALLY GOT TWENTY FOUR 
HOUR ELECTRICITY AND CAROL 
THATCHER FOLLOWS A TWENTY YEAR BATTLE 
FOR POWER 
OVER THERE IS A TINY ISLAND OF 
EIGG IN THE SCOTTISH INNER HEBDEE 
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO THE PEOPLE 
THERE MADE HEADLINES BECAUSE FOR 
THE FIRST TIME EVER THEY SWITCHED 
ON THEIR OWN REGULAR MAINS 
ELECTRICITY BUT NOW THAT EIGHT 
WITH ITS POPULATION OF SEVENTY SIX EIGHTY SIX HAS 
JOINED THE MODERN WORLD DOES THIS 
MEAN THE END FOR THE ISLAND'S 
TRADITIONAL WAY OF LIFE KATHLEEN 
EASE FAMILY HAS LIVED ON THE ISLAND 
FOR GENERATIONS WITH TWO YOUNG 
DAUGHTERS TO TAKE CARE OF GETTING 
ELECTRICITY HAS MADE LIFE EASIER 
IT IS GREAT FANTASTIC CAN HAVE MY 
WASHING MACHINE ON TUMBLE DRIER ON 
ANY TIME HAVE MY FRIDGE WORKING 
TWENTY FOUR SEVENTHS THE NIGHT AFTER WE GOT THE 
ELECTRICITY I HAD THE COLD AND I 
CAME DOWNSTAIRS TO MAKE MYSELF A 
COFFEE AND I WAS SITTING HERE BY 
TORCH AND I THOUGHT I CAN PUT A 
SWITCH ON 
YOU HAVE TWO YOUNG 
DAUGHTERS HOW DIFFERENT WILL IT BE 
FOR THEM AS MAINS ELECTRICITY 
CHILDREN 
THEY HAVE THE TELLY CHILDREN ALTHOUGH I TRY NOT TO PUT IT ON 
INTO THE EVENING L. DON'T THINK 
THEY WILL APPRECIATE THE WAY IT WAS 
WHEN WE WERE YOUNG 
YOU CAME HERE 
AS A CHILD TO STAY WITH YOUR 
GRANDPARENTS WHAT DID THEY DO FOR 
POWER 
WELL IN THOSE DAYS WELL IT POWER IS NOT THAT LONG AGO BUT IN THOSE 
DAYS THE GENERATOR WENT ON AT 
CHRISTMAS TIME BUT IN THE SUMMER 
THE GENERATOR WAS NEVER ON THERE 
WAS NO TELEVISION BUT YOU KNOW IT 
WAS GREAT BECAUSE AS KIDS WE WERE 
OUT ALL THE TIME 
THESE WINDMILLS 
ARE ONE PART OF A SCHEME WHICH HAS 
CATAPULTED THIS ISLAND FROM THE 
PAST INTO THE FUTURE GENERATING 
CLEAN ENERGY BEFORE THE MAINS 
ELECTRICITY ISLANDERS HAD TO 
DEPEND ON NOISY EXPENSIVE AND 
ERRATIC DIESEL GENERATORS WHAT A 
RACKET KATHLEEN'S HUSBAND IS GLAD 
THAT HIS LIFE IS A BIT QUIETER 
THESE DAYS WHAT A DIN 
WELL YOU GO 
OUT ON A COLD FROSTY NIGHT IT WOULD 
BE THUMP THUMP ALL OVER THE ISLAND 
NOBODY REALLY NOTICED UNTIL WE GOT 
THE ELECTRICITY HOW MUCH OF A 
RACKET THERE WAS BUT NOW EVERYBODY 
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU CAN HEAR THE 
BIRDS IN THE TREES 
HOW MUCH OF A 
HASSLE WAS THIS GENERATOR IT IS 
NOT EVEN IN THE HOUSE 
IF IT WAS IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT YOU USE TO 
PUT A PIN IN AND START IT UP 
IRVAIRIBLY IN YOUR KNICKERS MAINS MAINS STRISTY A REVOLUTION DEFINITELY DEFINITELY WE WERE LIVING IN THE DARK AGES NOW 
IT IS THE BEST THING SINCE SLICED 
BREAD WE HAVE COME FORWARD 
MANY OF THE ISLANDERS BELIEVE THAT 
FOR EIGHT TO SURVIVE AS A COMMUNITY 
THE POPULATION WILL HAVE TO DOUBLE 
AS THE WOMAN WHO RUNS THE ONE AND 
ONLY SHOP SUE IS AT THE HUB OF THIS 
CLOSE KNIT COMMUNITY THE LAND 
ONLY HAD POPULATION OF EIGHTY SIX DO YOU 
FORESEE THAT DOUBLING BECAUSE OF 
ELECTRICITY 
HOPEFULLY IT WILL ELECTRICITY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO MOVE HERE AND 
LIVE HERE AND WORK HERE ONE THING 
THAT IT COULD DO IS ENABLE PEOPLE 
TO WORK FROM HOME WHICH HAS BEEN A 
BIT OF A PROBLEM BEFORE WHEN YOU 
HAVEN'T HAD TWENTY FOUR HOUR POWER THEY 
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WORK ON THE 
INTERNET AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHAT WHAT IS THE NICEST THING ABOUT LIVING ON 
THIS ISLAND 
IT'S THE COMMUNITY 
WHEN I CAME HERE IT WAS THE 
LANDSCAPE THAT ATTRACTED ME AND I 
STILL LOVE THAT BUT IT'S THE 
COMMUNITY THAT IS VERY SPECIAL I I THINK THE NEW ELECTRICITY HERE HAS 
ENERGISED THE ISLANDER BRINGING 
THEM CLOSER TOGETHER BUT NOW THAT 
THE ISLAND IS SWITCHED ON THE THE 
MODERN WORLD DOES IT MEAN THE SUN 
WILL SOON BE SETTING ON ANOTHER 
UNIQUE PART OF THE COUNTRY 
THAT IS WHAT I NEED A WEEKEND 
THERE TO RELAX AND CHILL OUT 
HARKING BACK TO THAT ZIMERS CLIP 
LOADS OF YOU SENT IN YOUR TIECHES 
YOUR EFFORTS TO JOIN THEM WE WILL 
PICK THE BEST OF THEM SHORTLY HERE

JINGLE BELLS
