THE MOST INFLUENTIAL MAN ON THE 
PITCH THAT WAS WELL READ WELL PLAYED A GREAT TRY ABSOLUTELY SENSATIONAL THERE IS A TRY IT THEY HAVE MISTAKE 
POOR KEVIN PENNY AFTER BE MISTAKE SENSATIONAL TRY ONE SLIP AND SAINT 
HELENS TO RELIEVE ARE IN BUSINESS

WAS TRULY BRILLIANT ONE SECONDS AND 
TRULY AWFUL THE NEXT THESE ARE THE 
SIX TIES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE WE 
ARE LIVE AT HULL K. R. 
WHAT OF THESE TWO SIDES WHAT 
SHOULD WE EXPECT WITH SIX WINS 
ALREADY HULL K. R. ARE ON COURSE TO 
BETTER THEIR ELEVENTH PLACE FINISH LAST 
YEAR THEY PUSHED LEEDS CLOSED 
CLOSE TWO WEEKS AGO KEITH SENIOR 
ENDED THE HOME SIDE'S RESISTANCE 
AND LEEDS WON AT MILLENNIUM 
STADIUM AND THERE WAS A DERBY WITH 
HULL KEVIN MAIN THAT OPENED THE 
SCORING IN THE VERY FIRST MINUTE 
THERE WAS A TRY FROM DANIEL 
FITZHENRY IT WAS JUST AS TIGHT IN 
THE SECOND HALF CHEV WALKER 
LEVELLED THINGS UP ONCE AGAIN ALAN 
PIKE'S DROP GOAL GAVE HULL A ONE 
POINT ADVANTAGE RAVERS HAD THE 
FIELD POSITION THEY NEEDED AND 
BRAGGING RIGHTS WERE ASSURED 
ROVERS HAD IS FEARED COME INTO TODAY'S 
GAME ON THE BACK OF A HEARTBREAKING 
DEFEAT HUDDERSFIELD ROD JENSEN 
AND SCORED THEY LOOK CERTAIN TO 
EXTEND THAT ADVANTAGE JENSEN DROP 
THE BALL DROPPED THEN THERE WAS 
A MOMENT OF CONTROVERSY THE 
REFEREE APPEARED TO CALL A TACKLE 
BEFORE STEWART REARDON TOUCHED DOWN 
THE TRY WAS GIVEN THAT GAVE 
WARRINGTON THE IMPETUS THEY NEEDED 
THEY WERE ON COURSE FOR AN UNLIKELY 
VICTORY THE SECOND TRY SEALED THE 
COMEBACK THE GIANTS ARE SECOND 
FROM BOTTOM IN THE SUPERLEAGUE LET'S FIND OUT THE THOUGHTS OF 
THEIR COACH FOR HULL K. R. HE WAS IN 
THE STUDIO YESTERDAY 
YOU WERE IN 
OUR STUDIO FOR A CLASSIC MATCH 
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT TODAY I I CERTAINLY HOPE I DO NOT HAVE THE 
HEARTACHE OF YESTERDAY IT IS 
POINTING TO A GREAT GAME WE CAN 
TAKE INSPIRATION FROM YESTERDAY 
LET'S HOPE WE CAN PUT ON SOME TRIES 
IN THE LAST FEW MEETINGS COME UP WE 
HAVE SHOWN THAT BOTH TEAMS ARE NOT 
AFRAID TO HAVE THROWN THE BALL 
AROUND IN THE LAST FEW MEETINGS 
WE HAVE SHOWN WE ENJOY PLAYING 
AGAINST THEM 
TELL ME ABOUT THE 
MOOD IN THE CAMP 
WE ARE CONFIDENT 
WE HAVE HAD A VERY GOOD MONTHS WE 
BEAT HOLE MACRO LAST WEEK IN A VERY 
CUTE GAME WE SHOWED COMPOSURE 
HULL IF WE GO OUT LIKE WE DID LAST 
WEEKEND WE SHOULD GET THE JOB DONE 
TODAY 
JUSTIN HAD A RIGHT TO BE TODAY CONFIDENT NO SCENT DOORMAT IS 
BEING SUNG AT THE NESSUN DORMA 
I THINK IT IS HOME ADVANTAGE DORMA HAD HIS BEARD WHERE IN THE POSITION 
WHERE THEY SHOULD HAVE WON LAST 
WEEK HUDDERSFIELD THEY WERE 
CLINICAL WHEN THEY NEEDED TO BUT 
BIG PLAYERS GOT INTO POSITION L. 
THINK HOME ADVANTAGE I JUST THINK 
HULL K. R. 
I THINK HUDDERSFIELD WHEN 
YOU LOOK AT THE FORWARDS COME ARE 
GOING TO COME AT ONE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR 
AT THE FORWARDS ARE GOING TO 
COME OUT L. AM SURE THAT COACH WILL 
HAVE BEEN AT THE BOYS 
YOU TICK 
HUDDERSFIELD TO THE FINAL OF THIS 
COMPETITION IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WHAT DOES IT 
MEAN TO YOU AND THE TEAM 
WE REALLY 
ENJOYED OURSELVES IT WAS A SPECIAL 
OCCASION THAT DAY WE ENJOYED 
OURSELVES ONCE YOU HAVE HAD A 
TASTE YOU WANT TO GET BACK TODAY 
HAS A SPECIAL FEEL THERE IS A AGE 
ABOUT THE THING WE ARE LOOKING 
FORWARD TO IT 
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY 
ABOUT YOUR FORM AT THE MOMENT NOT 
WITH A WIN IN FIVE GAMES YOU SAY 
THERE IS A POSITIVE MOOD IN THE 
CAMP 
WE WERE REALLY UNLUCKY LAST CAMP WEEK I FELT WE WERE THE BETTER 
TEAM I HAVE SAID THAT CONSISTENTLY 
WE HAVE BEEN REALLY GOOD TODAY WE 
HAVE TO BE MORE CONSISTENT AND 
PROBABLY CONCENTRATE MORE THAN WE 
HAVE DONE THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES IN 
A GAME WHERE WE HAVE NOT BEEN AS 
GOOD AS WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WHERE 
WE HAVE GOT HURT WE HAVE EVERY 
INTENTION OF TODAY OF CONCENTRATING 
THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO 
ALL THE 
BEST THERE ARE OTHER HUDDERSFIELD 
PLAYERS DANCING ON THE SPOT BEFORE 
COMING OUT YOU ARE PLAYING WITH 
THEM LAST SEASON 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE 
A LOOK AT THE HALF BACKS KEVIN 
BROWN AND ROBINSON THIS IS THE 
BIGGEST FALLER PACK THAT 
HUDDERSFIELD HAVE THEY WILL BE 
GOING OUT TO START THE GAME FULL 
PACK 
WHAT ABOUT HULL K. R. 
AGAIN THE PACK FORWARDS PAUL BURKE IS VERY 
INFLUENTIAL AS HIS BISHER HIS 
FISHER IF THEY LOSE THIS THEY ARE 
OUT FOR ANOTHER YEAR IT COULD BE 
THE BREAK THEY WANT 
THEY WILL BE 
RELIEVED WHEN THEY COME OUT ON A 
PITCH THAT THERE IS A CLEAR BREEZE 
BLOWING THE PITCH WE WILL DO IT OUR BEST TOOK EMANATE 
YESTERDAY'S THERE THE LAST TIME 
OUR CAMERAS WHERE HERE ROSES AND 
BEAT WARRINGTON IN A BREATHLESS 
QUARTER FINAL TIE ROSES 
ROVERS THE INTO CHANGES COULD BE 
ABSOLUTELY VITAL BOTH TEAMS WILL 
BE WORRIED ABOUT THE WEATHER 
INTO CHANGES THEY NEED TO KNOW 
WHEN TO TAKE A BREATHER WE NEED TO 
TALK ABOUT HOME ADVANTAGE 
HUDDERSFIELD ARE LACKING CONFIDENCE 
AS PAUL COOKE GETS US AND THE WAY 
WITH BIG KICK DOWNFIELD UNDER 
WAY HOW BIG A FACTOR HIS 
CONFIDENCE 
YOU HAVE TO CONFIDENCE COMPARTMENTALISE YOU HAVE TO 
IGNORE YOUR FORM AND POSITION IN 
THE LEAGUE THAT IS WHAT 
HUDDERSFIELD WILL DO 
THEY ARE 
MISSING ONE POOR AT TWO PLAYERS 
JAMES WEBSTER IS MISSING FOR OF 
HULL KINGSTON ROVERS ONE OR TWO 
THE INITIALS SET HAS ENDED UP 
ADVANTAGE HULL KINGSTON ROVERS THEY WILL BE DISAPPOINTED NOT TO 
HAVE FINISHED THAT WE THEY KICKED 
DOWNFIELD WITH KICK DOWNFIELD NEWTON IS GETTING TREATMENT A 
CARRY ON WITHOUT HIM THEY CARRY 
ON THE AGGRESSION FROM HUDDERSFIELD 
HAS CARRIED NEWTON ROAD TO THE 
SIDELINES NEWTON 
THAT WAS A 
GREAT RIPOSTE FROM THE HUDDERSFIELD 
PACK THEY WILL SAY THEY WERE 
ADDING WEIGHT TO THE TACKLE THE 
TACKLE SHOULD BE COMPLETED THE 
HUDDERSFIELD PEOPLE TAKE HIM TO THE 
SIDE LINES 
THAT WAS A 
DEMONSTRATION OF THEIR 
DETERMINATION HE WAS JOINED BY TWO OF HIS TEAM MATES PRETTY QUICKLY SKANDALIS IS GRADBACH DRAGGED BACK 
NOT MISSING EACH 
OTHER 
HEAT GOOD CHASE FROM THE HUDDERSFIELD TEAM THAT WAS ADVENTUROUS PLAY HUDDERSFIELD ARE OFFSIDE KNOWS WINNING NO SWINGING OFFSIDE AGAIN THEY ARE GIVING PENALTIES AWAY THE REFEREE ASKED FOREHEAD TO BE 
TAKEN AGAIN GIVING AWAY TWO 
PENALTIES AS QUICKLY AS THAT CAN 
BREAK THE RESISTANCE OF A SIDE 
ABSOLUTELY ANOTHER CHEAP PENALTY 
THE STRESS LEVELS GET RAISED THEY DEFEND PRETTY WELL THEY HAVE 
LOST THIS YEAR ON BOTH OCCASIONS BY 
TWO A POINTS OR LESS SO THEY HAVE 
TO DEFEND VERY WELL TODAY THEY ARE HAPPY TO HAVE A BIT OF 
OXYGEN IN THEIR LUNGS THEY COULD 
DO WITH A BALL AS WELL MICHAEL LAWRENCE IS EIGHTEEN PROGRESSING NICELY THIS SEASON ASPINWALL HAD NOWHERE TO GO THIS 
EARLY IN THE GAME IT WILL BE THE 
TEAM THAT FINES AND OFFLOAD A 
OPEN THE GAME UP THE HULL KINGSTON ROVERS DEFENCE HAS ORGANISED ITSELF WELL THE REFEREE SAYS AROUND THE CHEST HE DID LOOK A TRIFLE HIGHER IT HIT THE CHEST AND BOUNCED UP STANLEY GENE HAS DROPPED IT STANLEY GENE IS CELEBRATING A 
BIRTHDAY TODAY WE THINK THIRTY FOUR COULD 
BE THIRTY EIGHT OF MIGHT BE THIRTY TWO OR MIGHT BE 
THIRTY TWO 
SOME WAY IN THE MIDDLE MIGHT BE THIRTY TWO ABOUT RIGHT SOMEWHERE IN THE 
MIDDLE HE HAS GIVEN IT AWAY FLOP ON BY 
ROB JENSEN AND IT WILL BE PENALTY FOR HULL KINGSTON ROVERS NO SCORE SO FAR WITH 
THE QUARTER OF THE FIRST HALF PLAYED BUT YOU GET THE FEELING THIS COULD BE VERY HIGH SCORING GAME GIVEN THE TEMPERATURE CLINT NEWTON NEVER REALLY HAD THE CHANCE TO GET IT AWAY THAT WAS A GOOD CLEARING RUN HAD 
HE PICKED UP ON THE INSIDE PASS HE 
MIGHT HAVE GONE THE DISTANCE HOW HOW GOOD WAS THAT FROM KEVIN BROWN TERRIFIC STUFF BY HUDDERSFIELD LAWRENCE WAS HAPPY ENOUGH TO KEEP THE BALL SAFE JENSEN IS PULLED DOWN IT IS DROPPED ON PAUL WETTER WHERE WILL CLAIM THE DRIVE TO THE NAKED EYE THIS LOOKS LIKE A HUDDERSFIELD TRY PAUL WHAT TO WEAR WAS OFFSIDE WITH THAT FINAL KICK WHATUIRA THAT WAS FIFTY TO FIFTY THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG THERE WAS 
WHATUIRA JUST STANDING IN FRONT 
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE CHECKING 
WHETHER HE WAS IN FRONT OF KEVIN 
BROWN 
ON THE SECOND KICK THAT ANGLE SUGGESTS HE IS POSSIBLY ON SIDE BRISCOE WAS WRONG FOOTED BECAUSE OF THE RICOCHET NOTHING WRONG THERE IT WAS THAT 
POINT THERE 
HAVE TO GET THE SLIDE 
RULE OUT DAVE THE MATHEMATICIANS 
ARE ALREADY OUT 
RICHARD SILVERWOOD 
IS THE VIDEO REFEREE THEY ARE NOT 
ALLOWED TO JUDGE FORWARD PASSES ON 
THE VIDEO REPLAY THAT IS BECAUSE 
OF THE ANGLES THE CAMERA SOMETIMES 
GIVES US 
THAT IS ON SIDE 
A VERY 
DIFFICULT ANGLE TO JUDGE THE WAITING IS OVER 
IT IS A TRY IT IS A HAD US IT IS THE 
HUDDERSFIELD FANS THAT FIND THEIR 
VOICE PAUL WHATUIRA WITH A VERY 
BIG TRIED FOR HIS SIDE WHAT A SET OF SIX THAT WAS FROM THE KICK 
TO THE IN GOAL AREA TO THE OTHER END OF THE FIELD IN SIX TACKLES MEMORABLE TRY FOR HIS SIDE HE HAS KICKED IT SUPERBLY WELL AND 
HUDDERSFIELD LEAD BY SIX POINTS TO 
NIL IT IS A TERRIFIC START FOR 
THEM FANTASTIC PLAY BY KEVIN BROWN NOT 
ONLY TO GET HIMSELF OUT OF THE IN 
GOAL FOR THE BREAK THAT TAKES HIM 
DOWNFIELD GIVES HUDDERSFIELD A 
POSITION TO GO ON WITH THE GAME 
CRABTREE COMES UP WITH ANOTHER ONE 
AND ENDS UP WITH TRY HOW MUCH THAT WILL HAVE LIFTED 
HUDDERSFIELD THEY LEAD AT HALF 
TIME IN WARRINGTON AGAINST CARDIFF 
AGAINST WARRINGTON IN CARDIFF 
LAST WEEK THESE TWO SIDE SUFFERED SOME 
CRACKING CONTESTS OF LATE TWO 
SIDES HAVE HAD ALL THE PORTENTS ARE SET DANGEROUS THAT IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A PENALTY 
THOSE ARE THE RULES PENALTY SOMETIMES THESE LOOK FAR MORE 
UNSAVOURY THAN THEY ACTUALLY ARE 
HE LANDED PRETTY WELL ROBINSON IS LOOKING LIVELY TODAY THE SNITCH GETS IT ON TO HUDSON AND 
HUDDERSFIELD HAVE A SECOND TRY IT 
IS A DAZZLING SPELL THEY ARE 
ENJOYING AT THE MOMENT THAT WAS 
SUPER TRY WONDERFUL HANDLING AND THE CONFIDENCE IS FLOWING HALF A CLAIM OF THAT BEING A 
FORWARD PASS DE REFEREE WAS NOT 
INTERESTED THE REFEREE THE 
SUPPORT PLAY THE OFFLOADING WAS 
SUPERB KEVIN BROWN WITH ALL THE CONFIDENCE 
IN THE WORLD SNITCH TO HUDSON 
SECOND TRY HIS SECOND ATTEMPT OF THE DAY THAT 
WAS A PRETTY EASY ONE HUDDERSFIELD 
LEAD TWELVE TO ZERO DO NOT THINK MANY 
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PREDICTED THIS 
SCORELINE AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME 
HULL K. R. HAVE JOB ON THEIR HANDS 
NOW THEY STARTED AS FAVOURITES BUT 
THEY HAVE A JOB AHEAD OF THEM KEVIN BROWN WAS THE INSTIGATOR 
THEY PUSHED REALLY HARD FOR THE 
OFFLOAD CONFIDENCE PLAYED SUCH A BIG PART 
IN THE GAME 
HUDDERSFIELD CERTAINLY 
HAD PLENTY IN THE FIRST HALF LAST 
WEEK AND THEY ARE SHARING IT THIS 
WEEK SHOWING IT IT HAS FILLED ARE HAPPY TO CONSOLIDATE HERE HUDDERSFIELD THIS IS TACKLE NUMBER SIX PHIL JONES IS ON THE TOUCHLINE 
I AM WITH JAMAHL LOLESI SUSPENDED 
TODAY YOU MUST BE ENJOYING IT 
TODAY 
YES THE WEATHER IS HOT TODAY TODAY AND I THINK CONDITIONS WELL 
PLAYED A BIG PART IN THE GAME 
WILL PLAYED YOU NEED TO IMPROVE ON DEFENCE WE 
HAVE BEEN A BIT DISAPPOINTING WITH 
THE DEFENCE BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN 
RECTIFY THAT AND WIN TODAY THERE THERE WAS A BIT OF MISUNDERSTANDING FROM 
CLINT NEWTON HE JUST SEEMED TO 
THROW THE BALL AWAY YOU CAN SEE THAT BEN COCKAYNE COMES 
ON TO THE PITCH 
THAT IS WHAT YOU 
WANT FROM THE BENCH IF YOU HAVE 
BEEN STRUGGLING YOU NEED A LIFT 
HUDDERSFIELD HAVE POSSESSION FOR 
THE MEANTIME THERE IS A CRY PAPACHRYSANTHOU 
OBSTRUCTION FOR THE REFEREE HAS 
PINNED HIM FOR PLAYING THE BALL OFF 
THE MARK THAT IS A VERY PEDANTIC 
PENALTY HE DID MOVE OFF THE MARK SO YOU HAVE TO SAY IT IS A PENALTY HULL K. R. THE NEED TO SCORE NEXT NEAT NEED BEN GAL THERE IS NOT THE MOST 
NOTICEABLE R. ON PITCH BUT HE 
DOES GET THROUGH HIS WORKLOAD 
BEN GAL A F. BEN 
DID HE 
HAVE ENOUGH TRACTION ON HIS DEBTS 
HE IS GETTING STUDS THAT WAS A TERRIFIC TRY IT REALLY 
IS FOUR MARKS TO THE REFEREE L. 
THINK HE WAS SLIGHTLY BLINDED AND 
COULD NOT SEE FULL HULL KINGSTON ROVERS ARE BACK IN AT 
SCOTT MURRELL'S SHEER DETERMINATION 
HAS PUT THEM BACK MINUTE THEY 
NEEDED TO TRY IN ITS IN IT PAUL COOKE HAS NOT TOO DIFFICULT A KICK IT HAS GONE OVER WE ARE BACK TO 
BASICS GAME TWELVE POINTS FOR 
HUDDERSFIELD THIS IS BOILING UP 
INTO VERY NICE TIE 
HE'D BACKED 
HIMSELF I'M GOING TO RUN HARDER 
THAN NEW AND GET OVER THE LINE HE 
BACKED HIMSELF YOU THE REFEREE IS COMPLAINING ABOUT 
HOW QUICKLY THE PLAYERS ARE COMING 
BACK FOR THE KICK OFF THEY ARE 
SPENDING MORE TIME TO RECOVER A FEW MORE SECONDS WASTED THERE 
WAS A GRAIN FROM NICK ROBINSON GREEN GRIN WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A TRY CONCEDED 
AGAINST IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET 
BACK AND NOT CONCEDE A FURTHER TRY IT WAS KICKED ON IT SHOULD BE A 
KNOCK ON SURELY 
ABSOLUTELY HAS 
HE PLAYED ADVANTAGE 
THAT WAS 
KNOCKED 
THERE IS AN 
ADVANTAGE FOR HULL KINGSTON ROVERS 
HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH IT 
IT HAS 
INVIGORATED THE HULL KINGSTON 
ROVERS PLAYERS THEY ARE BARELY THIRTY YARDS AWAY FROM THEIR OWN LINE I THINK BRIAN HUDSON HAD NOT REALISED IT WAS THE LAST TACKLE HAD HE JUST MISCOUNTED I THINK HE MISCOUNTED THE POSITION IS EXCELLENT FOR HULL KINGSTON ROVERS THAT WAS CHASED BY WEBSTER AND IT'S 
HENRY DID HE GET THE TOUCH DOWN 
DANIEL FITZHENRY 
I THINK HE WAS 
ONSIDE AND HE GOT THE BALL DOWN 
THAT WAS SET CLEVER PLAY IN THE 
BUILD UP WHAT RESPONSE BY HULL KINGSTON ROVERS THIS WILL TELL US ABOUT THE OF SIDE OFFSIDE HE IS ON SIDE BY A COUPLE OF YARDS ONSIDE THEY ARE CHEERING BECAUSE THEY CAN SEE THE BIG SCREEN HERE COMES THE DECISION IT IS A 
TRY AS EXPECTED FROM TWELVE TO ZERO DAN 
HULL KINGSTON ROVERS ARE BACK TO 
WIN IN A TWO DOWN PAUL COOKE HAS A CHANCE TO LEVEL 
THINGS UP IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT 
CONVERSION ATTEMPT IT WAS WIDE 
BY A DISTANCE WAS WIDE WE 
CERTAINLY HAVE CUP TIE ON AND 
HANDS HOUR HANDS OUR HANDS 
IT WAS A GREAT FINISH FROM DANIEL 
FITZHENRY HOURS AND HOURS ON THE 
PRACTICE FIELD IN RELATION TO 
THAT'S BUT THAT SKILL IN 
RELATION TO THAT SCALE SKILL IT IS A HIGH QUALITY GAME I THINK 
THE QUALITY OF HUDDERSFIELD NEEDS 
MENTIONING AS WELL 
HE HAS GIVEN 
THAT AS A KNOCK ON THAT WAS A 
LITTLE HARSH 
HE IS NOT 
INGRATIATING HIMSELF TO THE HOME 
FANS THAT IS NOT HIS JOB HE IS 
THERE TO MAKE CALLS 
YOU CAN SEEK 
THE REFEREE IS INDICATING A KNOCK 
ON SEE HUDDERSFIELD FIND THEMSELVES IN 
POSITION A AGAIN THEY HAVE AN 
EXCELLENT CHANCE TO RESPOND 
POSITION AGAIN JENSEN WAS CLIMBED ALL OVER BY CHEV 
WALKER IT HAS RESULTED IN THE BALL 
BEING KNOCKED ON HE HAS ALMOST TAKING IT THROUGH 
TOM HEMINGWAY WAS A TARGET FOR THAT 
BESIKTAS PARTICULAR TRY FOR 
HE HAS 
HAD AN IMPACT OFF THE BENCH FOR 
THAT PARTICULAR DRY IF DRIVE JENSEN LIKE BECOMING A JENSEN 
MIGHT BE BECOMING A BIT OF A 
LIABILITY THEY WERE UNLUCKY WITH 
THE FIRST ONE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
ABOUT OFFSIDE 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO 
SAY FROM THAT ANGLE HE DROPPED THE 
BALL UP ON THE BACK OF THE IMPACT 
HE IS A GREAT PASS PLAYER TO FINISH 
THE BALL IT GIVES THEM PLENTY OF 
CHANCE TO GET DOWN THAT DOESN'T 
IT 
NOTHING WRONG WITH EVERYTHING IT AFTER THEY DROP 
HE LOOKED SLIGHTLY 
UP FRONT OF HIM DIDN'T HE 
I WOULD 
SAY THAT WAS AN OFFSIDE WOULDN'T 
YOU 
I'D BET THAT HURT HIM THE YOU THE VIDEO REFEREE HAS MADE A DECISION 
I WONDER IF HE WILL COME TO THE 
RESCUE OF ROD JENSEN THAT IS THE 
OVERHEAD ISN'T IT HE IS MAKING BE 
IMPORTANT RUN AND I THINK HE IS 
OFFSIDE 
IT CERTAINLY LOOKS SOAP ON OFFSIDE THAT PICTURE OF 
HULL KINGSTON 
ROVERS FANS OF WAIT PATIENTLY 
WAIT PATIENT THEY'VE THE REFEREE 
WAS CONVINCED THERE HE WAS ONSIDE 
HULL KINGSTON ROVERS ARE IN THE 
LEAD HIGH COURT CRAIG HAS GIVEN THE BALL PLENTY OF THERE PAUL COOKE ROB JONES THEN IT IS NOT A NATURAL 
FOR BACK IS HE ROD KICK KICK THE BALL AS HIGH AS HE CANT AND GET 
THE CHASES DOWN THERE YOU CAN 
THEY KNOW THEY ARE IN THE LIMELIGHT 
SO AND IN THE FIRING LINE AND IN 
THE FIRING LINE THEY ARE TRAINING NOW HAS SIXTEEN TO TWELVE 
HOW DO THEY PICKED THEMSELVES UP I I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY 
CONSOLIDATE THEIR ROLE IN THIS GAME 
THEIR COACH WILL BE SMART ENOUGH TO 
RECOGNISE THAT THEY NEED TO GET 
SOME KICK PRESSURE ON HUDDERSFIELD HAVE GOT A BIT OF A FOOTHOLD FIVE YARDS OUT THAT IS ALL ASPINALL WAS DEALT WITH BY WEBSTER HE WAS DETERMINED TO GET THERE BUT 
HE WAS REPELLED IT IS A PENALTY 
IT WAS NOT SQUARE TWO DEFENDERS 
FROM HULL KINGSTON ROVERS WHEN NOT 
STOOD WHERE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
SIX MORE TACKLES FOR HAVE HAD HIS 
FILL TO ATTACK THIS LINE 
HUDDERSFIELD BRISCOE BOOT DID WELL HE CAME RIGHT ACROSS DID WELL IT WAS KNOCKED ON I THINK ANDY 
RALLY WAS TRYING TO PUT THE BALL 
DOWN ANDY RALEIGH 
HE IS NOT 
COMPLAINING TOO MUCH HE MUST A HAD 
A THUMB BALL OF THE BALL HE MUST 
HAVE HAD A FUMBLE OF THE BALL 
THERE IS EVERY SUSPICION THAT THEY 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A HAND IN THERE 
MORE THAN ONE 
THIS IS A TERRIFIC 
CUP TIE THIRTY THREE MINUTES HAVE BEEN 
PLAYED PLENTY OF POINTS IN THE 
SUNSHINE IN EAST YORKSHIRE IN EAST 
HULL NUMBER MAP HULL IT WAS DRIVEN IN BY A CROSS MEN 
THE AUSTRALIAN THERE ARE SEVERAL 
FORMER MELBOURNE PLAYERS IN THIS 
SIDE GARRETT CROSSMAN THE KICK WENT BACK BRITZ BACKWARDS COCKAYNE CLAIMS HE WAS KNOCKED OVER 
UP AFTER A BIG KICK OVER UP 
AFTER THE KICK THERE WAS CONTACT WASN'T THERE HERE IS MASON FIVE MINUTES TILL THE BREAK NOT BE 
CLEAN E. S. T. PLAY OF THE BALL NOT 
BE CLEANEST PLAY ROBINSON WENT FOR THEY KICK HE DID NOT PLAY ATTIC AT IT HULL KINGSTON ROVERS HAVE NOW 
LAUNCHED AN ATTACK 
THAT WAS A BIT 
OF A TOUGH CALL ON HUDDERSFIELD 
THEY WERE WAITING FOR A FEW SECONDS 
BEFORE THEY GOT THE CALL I 
THINK HE HAS GIVEN OFFSIDE I THINK HUDDERSFIELD NEED HALF TIME A 
BIT MORE THAN HOLD KINGSTON DO IF 
THEY PLAY ON IT IS A HUGE SET FOR 
THE HUDDERSFIELD TEAM 
THEY HAVE 
FIVE TACKLES TO COME AND THE 
MOMENTUM IS WITH HULL K. R. SCORE 
AGAIN AND IT IS LOOKING RELATIVELY 
COMFORTABLE THE REFEREE MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO GO 
FOR THE VIDEO AND HE IS BUT THERE 
IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT THAT 
THIS IS A TRY THERE MAY BE A HUDDERSFIELD CASE 
FOREIGN SECOND KICK HERE 
IT WAS 
BRISCOE HIMSELF FORGOT THE BROOD ON 
TO IT WASN'T IT WHO MAC GOT THE 
BUT ON TO IT I THINK IF YOU GROUNDS THE BALL O. K. 
IT IS A TRY HE IS CERTAINLY ON 
SIDE IF HE GROUNDS THE BALL 
NOTHING WRONG WITH THE GROUND THERE WAS ENOUGH DOWNWARD PRESSURE 
ON THAT BRISCOE MIGHT HAVE HURT 
HIMSELF IN SCORING THE TRY HE IS 
STILL BEING TREATED BEHIND THE 
TOUCH LINE IT IS A HERO'S WELCOME FROM THE 
HULL KINGSTON ROVERS FANS BRISCOE 
IS STILL BEING TREATED THE TRY IS 
CONFIRMED AND HULL KR'S DOMINANCE 
IS CONFIRMED FROM TWELVE TO ZERO DOWN THEY 
LEAD BY TWENTY POINTS TO TWELVE 
HE HAS GOT A SHINER FOR HIS TROUBLES HE HAS 
HE LOOKS AS IF TROUBLES HE HAS BROKEN SOMETHING ON HIS NOSE 
HE DOES NOT A GAME THAT IMPROVES 
YOUR LOOKS 
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO 
SAY 
NOT FOR SOME ANYWAY SAY SUPPOSE IT DEPENDS WHAT THE 
STARTING POINT IS 
AGAIN WHAT ARE 
YOU TRYING TO SAY NOTHING PAUL COOKE WITH ONE OF THE SIMPLEST 
CONVERSION ATTEMPTS TWENTY THREE TO TWELVE NOW 
HULL K. R. LEAD BEN FISHER HAD THE KIND OF FORTUNE 
YOU NEED IN THESE OCCASIONS DALYA 
FOUND THE KICK PLAY BRISCOE 
LITERALLY PUT HIS BODY AND FACE ON 
THE LINE GOOD PLAY BY GAILY AS WELL ON THE FIFTH TACKLE GALEA NEVER LET A RUGBY BALL BOUNCE UNDER NOT SINK HUDDERSFIELD WILL GET THE BALL BACK I DO NOT THINK THEY HAVE WON PLAYED A TRY AND PUT 
SOMETHING ON TO GET THE POINTS 
BACK HUDDERSFIELD WERE FLYING AT TWELVE 
POINTS TO NIL HULL K. R. SUDDENLY 
FOUND THEY GOGGLES AND THEY LEAD BY 
TWENTY TWO TO TWELVE IT HAS BEEN A HALF OF 
CONTRASTING FORTUNES HUDDERSFIELD HUDDERSFIELD NEED HALF TIME MORE THAN KINGSTON 
PROBABLY IT IS INTERESTING THAT 
THE DOWNTURN IN THEIR FORM HAS BEEN 
ONE HUDSON HAS BEEN OFF THE FIELD 
WHEN HUDSON HAS BEEN OFF THE 
FIELD I THINK THEY NEED TO 
REINTRODUCE HIM 
WE HAVE ANOTHER 
TENSE AND TO MALTA WAS CUP TIED 
THE VISITORS HUDDERSFIELD SCORED 
THE FIRST TWO TRIES THE FIRST FOUR 
PAUL WHATUIRA AND THE SECOND FOR 
THE CAPTAIN RYAN HUDSON THE HULL 
K. R. FANS DEMANDED A RESPONSE AND 
THEY GOT IT WITH SCOTT MURRELL IN 
A MATTER OF MINUTES DANIEL 
FITZHENRY SCORED AND THEY WERE 
NEARLY LEVEL A BIG MISTAKE FROM 
ROB JENSEN AND HULL K. R. GOT LUCKY 
SHAUN BRISCOE GOT EIGHT TO THE 
HEAD AND THE COMEBACK WAS COMPLETE 
GOT HIT ON THE HEAD WILL STOP 
GOT HIT ON THE HEAD 
I DID NOT THINK WE COULD GET 
ANYTHING BETTER THAN YESTERDAY IT 
IS NOT A BAD START HUDDERSFIELD HUDDERSFIELD STARTED THE GAME AS WE THOUGHT THEY 
WOULD THEY STAMP THEIR AUTHORITY 
ON THE MIDDLE OF THE PARK BUT HULL 
K. R. HAVE ANSWERED BACK IN GREAT FORM 
I THINK THEIR COACH WILL BE PLEASED 
WITH THEM IN HALF TIME BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE TURNED UP AT THE RIGHT PLACES 
THEY ARE TURNING HUDDERSFIELD 
AROUND SPOTTED A COUPLE OF 
WEAKNESS AND UPPERTON HUDDERSFIELD 
UNDER PRESSURE 
WHAT WOULD YOU BE 
SAYING TO THE HUDDERSFIELD PLAYERS 
IN THE DRESSING ROOM THEY MUST BE 
FEELING DEMORALISED 
GET BACK IN 
AND DO THE SAME AS THEY STARTED 
THEY WERE AGGRESSIVE THE RIGHT 
HAND DEFENCE LUKE ROBINSON AND 
MICHAEL LAWRENCE THEY DEFENDED 
VERY WELL THEY WRAPPED UP JAKE 
WEBSTER THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE 
HAD FOUR TRIES FROM KICKS THE 
QUALITY OF THE KICKING HAS BEEN 
EXCEPTIONAL THEY HAVE BEEN A FEW 
LUCKY RICOCHETS AS WELL THERE 
HAVE BEEN 
THEY NEUTRALISED EACH 
OTHER FOR THE FIRST TWELVE MINUTES IT 
WAS VERY INTENSE AND HUDDERSFIELD 
PARTICULARLY IN DEFENCE WERE 
RELENTLESS 
THEY PICKED A BIG PACK RELENTLESS AND THEY PILED IN 
WHEN YOU HAVE A 
BIG PACK IN THESE SORT OF 
CONDITIONS IT CAN DRAIN THE BIG 
BOYS OF THEIR ENERGY AFTER THE 
FIRST TWENTY MINUTES WHEN HUDDERSFIELD 
LOOKED AS IF THEY HAD CONTROL THEY 
WERE GIVING IT TO THE HULL K. R. 
FORWARD PACK AT THEN THEY STARTED 
TO BECOME TIRED 
THIS STARTED WITH 
KEVIN BROWN AND EARL CRABTREE GOOD GOOD FIELD POSITION A LOVELY KICK 
BROWN COVERS BEHIND AND SPOTS THE 
GAP AND IS AWAY HE MAKES ABOUT TWENTY 
YARDS FROM THIS ONE OF TEN 
OFFLOADS IN THE FIRST HALF LOVELY 
OFFLOAD AND THEY ARE THROUGH 
FROM THIS ONE HE PUTS A LOVELY 
KICK IN THERE IS THE RICOCHET HE 
IS DEFINITELY ON SIGN PAUL 
WHATUIRA IS ON SIDE HE CHASES THE 
KICKER BRISCOE IS WRONG FOOTED AND 
IT IS A TRY 
HUDDERSFIELD'S SCORED QUICKLY AFTER 
THAT HUDDERSFIELD 
IT IS A STAND 
OFF HE IS TAKING THE BALL INTO THE 
PROP FORWARD YOU WOULD EXPECT A 
STAND OFF TO BE SMASHED BY MICHAEL 
FOWLER HE HAS SMITH DID OUT 
STRAIGHTAWAY THERE IS THE SUPPORT 
ANGLE MICHAEL BELLA IT TO HIS 
ACE OF TACKLE HE WILL NOT BE HAPPY 
KEVIN BROWN IS QUICK ON HIS FEET 
IT IS SOFT TACKLE THEY PROVED IN 
THE FIRST FIFTEEN MINUTES THAT THEY HAVE 
THE ABILITY TO WIN IT HULL KAYE R. 
COTS A BIT 
MORALE TO KIT ON 
THE LINE HULL K. R. ARE A BIT LUCKY 
HE TICKET ON THE LINE 
THE SECOND TRY CAME SOON AFTER THAT 
THE QUALITY OF THE KICK COCKAYNE 
WENT ACROSS WHO HAS STUCK IT WAS A 
LOVELY WEIGHTED KICK IT WAS A GOOD 
CHASE BY THE WINNER A WINGER IT 
WAS VERY CLINICAL 
THEY MUST BE 
PRACTISING THOSE KICK THERE ARE A 
WHOLE VARIETY OF KICKS THEY THEY PRACTISE IT IF YOU ARE LUCKY THE 
BALL BOUNCES UP IF YOU ARE UNLUCKY 
IT'S GIBBS OUT OF PLAY IT WAS 
BRILLIANT IT KICKS 
WE COULD SAY 
THAT THE SUN MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN HIS 
EYES 
HE DROPPED ONE KICK EARLIER EYES THAN THIS THE BALL MOVES A LOT HE 
SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT THIS IS 
PROBABLY WHERE HULL K. R. SOLVE SAW 
ONE OF THEIR WEAKNESSES 
THIS WAS 
THE OFF SIDE WAS HE OR WAS HE NOT 
IS HE BOUGHT IS HE NOT OFFSIDE L. 
DO NOT THINK THE VIDEO REFEREE WAS 
OFFERED THIS ONE IS HE OR IS HE 
NOT IT COMES DOWN TO JENSEN ONCE 
HE HAS DROPPED THE FIRST ONE THERE 
IS A WEAKNESS FAIR PLAY TO THEM 
THE COACHING STAFF SWAPPED HIM AND 
PUT HIM ON THE WING 
HULL KAYE R. 
WEBB THEN POUNCING ON EVERY 
OPPORTUNITY THEY'VE GOT HULL K. R. 
THE DECISION TO KICK BELOW BALL 
THROUGH HE WAS ALMOST KNOCKED OUT 
BURR LOW BALL 
HE HAD GOOD 
DRIBBLING SKILLS THE WORRYING 
THING FOR A HUDDERSFIELD AFTER 
LAST WEEK WHEN THEY WERE IN FRONT 
AGAIN A GOOD TWELVE POINTS IN FRONT AND 
THEY ARE BEHIND AT HALF TIME 
THEY GO TWELVE POINTS 
THEY WILL BE 
SAYING YOU ARE DOING ALL RIGHT 
YOUR SECOND HALF AN HOUR WAS 
SENSATIONAL IN THE HUDDERSFIELD 
DRESSING ROOM THEY ARE TAKING ON A 
LOT OF WATER 
JAMES WEBSTER IS NOT PART OF THIS 
OCCASION AND NOT PART OF THE SEASON 
DUE TO INJURY HOW ARE YOU DOING I I AM NOT HEADING BACK TO AUSTRALIA L. 
WILL BE AROUND L. WILL BE PLAYING 
BY THE END OF THE YEAR THE BOYS 
LOVE DOING FANTASTIC ON A GREAT DAY 
AT CRAVEN PARK 
HOW IMPRESSED ARE 
YOU WITH THE TEAM SPIRIT COMING 
FROM BEHIND AS THEY 
HAVE DONE WE WE HAVE STARTED BADLY ON NUMEROUS 
OCCASIONS I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE 
TOUGH WITH THE WEATHER BEING AS IT 
IS TODAY THEY HAVE HUNG IN REALLY 
WELL I REALLY EXPECT THEM TO GET 
ON WITH IT NOW THEY HAVE GOT USED 
TO BE CONDITIONS L. L. AM WORRIED THEY 
MAY BE ONE MAN SHORT ON THE BENCH 
THE PLAYERS ARE ON THEIR WAY OUT 
LET'S JUST REMIND YOU OF THE OTHER 
TYPES TODAY TIES IT IS A HUGE STAKE IN THE 
PREMIERSHIP RAY STUBBS IS IN HIS 
STUDIO IF YOU PRESS THE RED BUTTON 
YOU CAN FIND OUT ABOUT THAT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO EXPECT OF THE 
SECOND HALF 
NEITHER OF THESE TWO 
SIDES HAVE A GREAT PEDIGREE IN THE 
CHALLENGE CUP HULL KINGSTON ROVERS 
HAVE ONLY WON THE AICHA AL WAFI IT 
ONCE IT WAS IBANEZ OCCASION IT 
ONCE IT WAS A FAMOUS OCCASION 
THEY HAVE NAMED A BARK AFTER THAT 
SCORELINE 
BAR WHOEVER ESCAPES SCORELINE FROM THIS PARTICULAR TIME WILL BE 
FULL OF CONFIDENCE TIE IT WILL BE REALLY DIFFICULT FOR THEM 
CLINT NEWTON HAS GIVEN THEM THEM MOMENTUM HULL KINGSTON ROVERS ARE GOING TO 
FINISH INSIDE THE HUDDERSFIELD HALF 
THEY'RE GOING TO GO WITH EIGHT KICK A KICK THAT WAS A SOLID CARRY FROM 
ASPINWALL THEY WENT ONE HUNDRED METRES IN 
RELATION TO THE BALL HUDDERSFIELD HUDDERSFIELD ARE LOOKING FOR A BIT OF WIDTH 
THEY WILL HAVE TO FIND A WAY 
THROUGH AT LEAST TWICE AS NOT 
CONCEDE IF THEY'RE GOING TO WIN 
AND NOT DANIEL FITZHENRY HAS RUN IT BACK 
HE BOSWELL TAKEN HE WAS WELL 
TAKEN IT WAS GOOD TO SEE JAMES 
WEBSTER TALKING AT HALF TIME WHAT A STUNNING START TO THIS 
SECOND HALF 
THAT WAS ON THE BACK 
OF A MISTAKE FROM THE HULL KINGSTON 
ROVERS SIDE 
COCKAYNE IS NO SLOUCH THAT WAS A FREE RUN IN FOR PAUL WHATUIRA 
IT IS JUST THE START THEY WHATUIRA WOULD HAVE WANTED IT HAS BROUGHT 
THEM BACK TO WITHIN SIX POINTS IT 
IS WITHIN THEIR GRASP AGAIN HE HAS PULLED IT WIDE HE IS BACK 
TO ME THEN IT IS BACK TO WITHIN 
SIX POINTS BUT CUP TIE IS ON AGAIN 
IT IS NOT QUITE WHAT IT SHOULD BE 
FROM HULL KINGSTON ROVERS PAUL 
LATTER WE'RE IS NO SLOUCH PAUL 
WHAT A RE RUN PAUL WHATUIRA HERE IS HEMINGWAY 
HE IS TRYING TO DRIVE IT IN AGAIN HE IS LOOKING TO CONSOLIDATE AGAIN 
CRABTREE WAS ALMOST CAUGHT IN 
POSSESSION IT BOUNCED UP NICELY FOR SKANDALIS THAT WAS DIFFICULT BUT TAKEN ONE ENOUGH BY FOX ON IN THE FIRST HALF IT WAS TWELVE TO 
NAIL WHAT HE TURN AROUND 
HE HAS 
TOLD DENTISTS TO STICK HE HAS 
TOLD THEM TO STICK WITH WHAT 
THEY'RE DOING 
THE TRY HAS GIVEN 
YOU AN UNDOUBTED BOOST 
WE WERE 
LOOKING FOR A GOOD START IT WAS 
PRETTY MUCH PERFECT 
THANKS AGAIN 
CHEERS GENERALLY BUT TEAM THAT CONTROLS 
THE BALL WELL CONTROLLED THE GAME 
B. TEAM THE TEAM IT IS A PENALTY FOR HUDDERSFIELD 
RIGHT THERE MARK AT YOUR PERIL 
THEM OFF LAWRENCE HAS STEPPED INSIDE HULL 
KINGSTON ROVERS'S DEFENCE HAS ACTED 
QUICKLY ENOUGH IT IS A STEEL 
ANOTHER SIX TACKLES FOR BEN TUNE 
HAMMERED THIS LINE FOR BEN TO 
HAMMER THIS LINE FOUR TACKLES TO COME DE WANT TO TALK TO YOUR 
PLAYERS NOW DO YOU WANT HE HE ASKED HIM IF HE WANTED TIME TO TALK 
TO THEM 
WE WILL GET OUR BREATH 
BACK AND LET YOU KNOW WHEN WE ARE 
READY WHAT A TRY WHAT A FANTASTIC SCORE 
BY HUDDERSFIELD A PINCHED THAT ONE 
PUT THAT ONE DOWN TO CRABTREE HE 
GOT THE BALL OUT THAT WAS THE 
DIFFERENCE 
CRAVEN PARK IS TURNED DIFFERENCE AT THE MOMENT A DID NOT EXPECT 
THIS STUNNED AT THE MOMENT A 
DID NOT 
WHAT A SUPERB PLAY FROM 
CRABTREE THAT WAS A GREAT CATCH 
FROM ASPINWALL WHAT A SUPER TRY 
LOOK AT THIS AGAIN THEY WERE 
TRYING TO HURT HIM HE IS BIG HE 
CANNOT BE KNOCKED OVER SO BIG 
THE PASS FROM ROBINSON NEEDS 
PATCHING THAT WAS GREAT TRY THEY HAVE FOUND THEIR VOICES IT WAS A FINE LOOKING KICK IT IS 
TWENTY TWO POINTS APIECE WE HAVE ANOTHER 
CLASSIC CUP TIGHT ON AN AN AND 
HANDS 
THEY STARTED THE FIRST HALF HANDS EXACTLY THE SAME CUP TIE ON OUR 
HANDS THE BALL IS COMING OUT 
WHATEVER YOU SAY THE BALL IS 
COMING OUT ROBINSON HAS FOUND THE 
PASS PLATES WOLVES ASPINWALL 
PLAY TO ASPINWALL 
WE THOUGHT HULL 
KINGSTON ROVERS HAD IT IN A BACK 
POCKET AT TWENTY TWO POINTS APIECE WHO 
KNOWS WE HAVE STOPPED GUESSING 
HALF AN HOUR LEFT TO PLAY AND 
ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN YET DO NOT 
FORGET THE PROSPECT OF EXTRA TIME 
AS WELL HERE IS ROBINSON EIGHT YOU HAVE BEAR HUDDERSFIELD 
MAN WRAPPED UP TWO TACKLES TO COME 
THEY DO HAVE BE HUDDERSFIELD MAN 
WRAPPED UP HULL K. R. NEED TO FINISHED THE SET 
THE LAST FOUR HAVE BEEN COUPLE OF 
EREZ A COUPLE OF PENALTIES AND 
THEY HAVE PUT THEMSELVES UNDER TOO 
MUCH PRESSURE AREAS ERRORS THEY HAVE LOST IT AGAIN 
IS A CHANCE TO BREAK THAT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ASPINWALL 
KNOCK 
BEAT HALE OF THE TAIT AT 
THE MOMENT IS HANDLING THOSE KICKS 
BUT HAIL OF THE TAPE THE TALE THIS GAME IS SWITCHING ONE WAY AND THEN BE A BIRTH THE OTHER THAT WAS A GOOD PLAY BY CHEV WALKER THEY ARE SENSING ANOTHER SCORE FOX WITH THE FINNISH HULL KINGSTON ROVERS HIT THE LEAD AGAIN THE THOUGHT THAT WAS A BIT OF A 
FORWARD PASS AT THE END BUT YOU 
CANNOT KNOCK THE QUALITY OF THE 
SKILL ON THE FRINGE I THOUGHTFUL 
STOP SEVEN TRIES IN ELEVEN GAMES FOR 
PETER FOX 
HE IS A REAL RUNNER HE 
SHOWED HOW GOOD HE IS AT FINISHING THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT THE FORWARD PASS THOUGH THEY GET NUMBERS ON THE FRENCH IN 
RELATION TO THREE ON TWO ON THE 
FRINGE WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT 
THAT THEY CREATE AN OVERLAP THREE HULL KINGSTON ROVERS PLAYERS 
ON TWO HUDDERSFIELD PLAYERS IT IS 
A QUESTION OF EXECUTION AND SOME 
PEOPLE WERE ASKING IS THAT 
FORWARD 
THE VIDEO REFEREE CANNOT FORWARD JUDGE ON FORWARD PASSES BUT THE 
TOUCH JUDGE WAS CLOSE NOT THE BEST OF ANGLES AND HE HAS 
CRACKED IT JUST WIDE BUT HULL 
KINGSTON ROVERS HAVE THE LEAD THEY 
HAVE STEM A TIDE THAT WAS FLOWING 
AGAINST THEM 
ONLY TWO HUDDERSFIELD 
DEFENDERS AGAINST RE HULL K. R. 
ATTACKERS AGAINST THREE THE 
QUESTION IS ABOUT THE FINAL PASS 
DO NOT INVITE TEAMS ON TO YOUR GOAL 
LINE BECAUSE IT IS TOO HARD TO 
DEFEND PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO BE IN 
THAT PART OF THE FIELD CLEVER PLAY BY MICHAEL VELLA BRISCOE ENDED SCORING A 
TRY IN THE FIRST HALF WE SAW THEM 
WITH BLOOD POURING FROM HIS NOSE AS 
HE LEFT THE FIELD THE GOOD NEWS IS 
HIS NOSE IS NOT BROKEN HE'S GROGGY 
BUT BACK ON THE BENCH DOCTORS ARE 
KEEPING AN EYE ON HIM TO SEE IF HE 
WILL TAKE ANY FURTHER PART IN THE 
GAME 
THEY ARE HOPING THEY DO NOT GAME HAVE TO RISK HIM THEY WOULD LOVE 
TO GET A BIT OF A CUSHION FOUR TACKLES TO COME VELLA STEPS OUT OF A TACKLE AND 
SCORES ANDY RALEIGH IS DISGUSTED 
WITH HIMSELF THAT HE COULD NOT HOLD 
ON TO VELLA VELLA STARTED IT WITH 
A CLEVER CATCH HE HAS GIVEN HIS 
SIDE A PENALTY ON THE HALFWAY LINE 
HE FINISHED TRY WITH GREAT STRENGTH HE DOES NOT SCORE MANY THAT WAS SMART PLAY FROM VELLA IN 
THE FIRST PLACE YOU HAVE TO START 
IN THE FIELD OF PLAY BUT IF YOU 
CATCH THE BALL WITH ONE FOOT IN AND 
ONE OUT THE BALL IS BACK TO A 
PENALTY STRAIGHT THROUGH NO PROBLEMS ANDY RALEIGH WILL BE DISAPPOINTED 
WITH THAT EFFORT IN RELATION TO THE 
ONE ON ONE AGAIN THE OCCASIONAL VIEWER MIGHT 
RECOGNISE THE FACE BUT NOT THE 
SHIRT PAUL COOKE WAS ONCE HULL 
F. C. PLAYER BEFORE CROSSING THE GREAT 
DIVIDE AND JOINING HULL KINGSTON 
ROVERS HE'S GOT THE VICTORY IN THE EPIC 
FINAL FAR HULL F. C. IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE HE 
SCORED TEN POINTS IN IT TWENTY MINUTES LEFT 
YOU HAVE TO SAY THERE IS POSSIBLE 
WAY BACK FOR HUDDERSFIELD BUT THEY 
DO NEED TO SCORE NEXT DON'T THEY 
I THINK THREE SCORES IS TOO MANY 
FOR BOTH TEAMS WE HAVE SEEN THIS GAME TWIST AND TURN SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY TIMELESS A LITTLE PART ON THE BACK FOR KEVIN 
BROWN HE TRIED LITTLE TOO HARD IN THE TACKLE HE IS LOOKING TO SET A PLATFORM AGAIN PAUL COOKE HAS NOT HAD HIS MOST 
PROMINENT OF GAMES 
HIS KICKING 
GAME HAS BEEN O. K. RESULTING IN 
THREE TRIES WE ALREADY KNOW THAT SAINT HELENS WILL 
BE IN THAT DRAW HULL KINGSTON 
ROVERS ARE LOOKING FAVOURITES TO BE 
IN THE DRAW AT THE MOMENT YOU HAVE WHITEHAVEN TOMORROW NIGHT 
HOPEFULLY THE PLAYERS WILL NOT BE 
TOO DISTRACTED WE HAVE HURDLE 
TOMORROW NIGHT 
WE'LL BE WATCHING 
THE DRAW OR TRYING TO KEEP YOURSELF 
IGNORANT OF IT 
I WILL BE IGNORANT 
I AM SURE HE HAS KNOCKED ON THE PEOPLE THAT 
HAVE CHANGED THIS GAME HAVE BEEN 
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PREPARED TO BACK 
THEMSELVES COCKAYNE HAS LOOK 
DANGEROUS IT HAS CAUSED PROBLEMS 
FOR HULL K. R. IT IS HARD TO GENERATE 
THAT KIND OF ENERGY ALL THE TIME IN 
THIS WEATHER THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE 
MADE THE DIFFERENCE HAVE BEEN THE 
ONES THAT HAVE SPREAD THEIR LEGS UP TWO SCORES REQUIRED WITH SEVENTEEN MINUTES LEFT STANLEY DEAN WAS OFFSIDE AND JUST 
GAVE HIMSELF UP ON THE LINE 
STANLEY GENE OF IT HAS BOUNCED OUT OF PLAY 
RELATIVELY QUIET MOMENT OF THE GAME 
THE MEMORY OF THE GREAT JACK GIBSON 
THE AUSTRALIAN COACH THE 
AUSTRALIAN SADLY PASSED AWAY ON 
FRIDAY IN THE MEMORY 
I HAD THE 
GOOD FORTUNE TO PLAY UNDER HIM AND 
I TOOK ADVICE FOR HIM WHEN I 
STARTED COACHING HE WAS THE MASTER 
OF THE ONE LINER DAVE 
WERE WILL 
NOT NECESSARILY REPEAT THEM HERE 
WE WILL NOT HE WAS A BIG CHARACTER 
IN THE GAME OF RUGBY LEAGUE IN THIS GAME ERRORS HAVE GENERALLY LED TO TRIES WELL READ BY COCKAYNE HE HAS MADE 
A DIFFERENCE TO THE ROVERS SIDE 
HE 
HE WAS THE FIRST CHOICE FULLBACK 
BEFORE BRISCOE WAS SIGNED HE HE PROBABLY FEELS HE HAS A POINT TO 
PROVE I'M NOT SURE THEY ARE IN THE RIGHT 
PART OF THE FIELD WITH FIFTEEN MINUTES 
TO GO APPLAUSE FOR NEWTON'S EFFORT HE 
HAS BEEN A TIRELESS WORKER TODAY 
HE IS A A THOROUGHLY DESERVED REST 
HE IS GOING OFF WALKER HAS GOT THERE TOUCH DOWN ONSIDE BUT THERE IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER 
THE BALL WENT BACKWARDS AND OFF 
HOME AND WHETHER THE BALL WAS 
BRANDED PROPERLY BY CHEV WALKER THEY CERTAINLY GAVE COOKE ENOUGH 
TIME TO KICK THE BALL NO PRESSURE 
ON HIM SO HE COULD PICK HIS BASE IN 
HIS TIME THINK 
K. R. 
PERSON KNOCKED IT BACK IF YOU GET 
STAN WOULD PRESSURE THAT IS TRY 
IF HE GETS DOWNWARD PRESSURE IT 
IS DIFFICULT TO TELL OFFSIDE 
ONSIDE FROM THAT YOU WOULD 
NORMALLY HER ROUND THE SIDE OF THE 
TEAM CHASING THE BALL GO WITH 
THE SIDE GROUNDING WILL BE AN ISSUE TOO IS THERE A KNOCK ON BY EVERTON NOT A TRY HE DID NOT HAVE CONTROL WE HAVE SEEN THEM GIVEN DOWNWARD 
PRESSURE IS A MATTER FOR DEBATE 
SOME TIME SOMETIMES 
HE LOST 
DIBBLE THAT IS NOT A TRY HE 
LOST THE BALL 
EVERY OTHER ISSUE IT 
IS ACADEMIC THE FINAL ISSUE IS 
WHETHER WALKER HAD DOWNWARD 
PRESSURE AND HE DID NOT THEY'RE 
NOT GOING TO LIKE THE DECISION 
LOCALLY THEY HAVE OBVIOUSLY GIVEN IT AS A 
KNOCK ON FROM ROB JENSEN HE TRIED 
TO MAKE THE CATCH INITIALLY IT IT KEEPS A REASONABLE BALANCE TO THE 
GAME ONLY TWO SCORES IN IT IF 
HULL K. R. HAD SCORED THEN IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN THE END IN YOUR FACE DEFENDING FROM JONES 
IT HAS TO BE THEY ARE DESPERATE TO 
STAY IN THIS COMPETITION THEY NEED 
TWO SCORES WHATUIRA'S CODE HIMSELF HURT HIMSELF WHATUIRA IS NOT LOOKING TOO HEALTHY AT THE MOMENT THERE WAS JUST AN ANKLE TAP ON 
KEVIN BROWN 
HE LOST HIS FOOTING 
IT WAS THREE ON ONE SIX POINTS 
WHEN YOU ARE DOWN YOU LACKED JUST 
GOES AGAINST YOU YOUR LUCK THAT COULD BE THE PLAYER OF THE GAME JUST OVER 
TEN MINUTES LEFT TO PLAY TEN POINTS IN IT IT IS NOT BEYOND 
HUDDERSFIELD BUT THEY HAVE TO COME 
UP WITH SOMETHING VERY BRAVE IN THE 
CLOSING TEN MINUTES HULL K. R. CLING 
ON HERE ANXIOUS MOMENTS FOR THE COACH JOHN SHARP ON THE SIDELINES HEAD AND FEET TO HULL KINGSTON 
ROVERS TALK ABOUT NOT GIVING UP 
THE DRAWS THE CLAUSE HULL KINGSTON ROVERS I IN A GREAT 
POSITION ARE IN 
THE DIFFERENCE 
THE DIFFERENCE AT THE MOMENT IS THE KICKS AND THE 
RESULTS FROM TIP FROM KICKS THAT WAS A GREAT CHASE BACK LOOK 
WHO IT WAS CLINT NEWTON HAS GIVEN 
HIS ALL HOW GOOD WAS THAT 
IT WAS 
AMAZING YOU WOULD BACK ASPINWALL 
EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK THERE WERE A 
COUPLE OF PLAYERS FINGERTIPS AND 
INCHES AGAIN GET YOUR FOOT IN AS 
WELL 
I THINK HE MIGHT BE WANTING WELL TO GET BACK FROM WHERE HE CAME 
COCKAYNE IS RATTLED HUDDERSFIELD 
HAVE HAD CHANCE IN THE LAST FEW 
MINUTES TO SCORE TRIES THAT WOULD 
PUT THEM RIGHT BACK IN THE CONTEST 
HULL KINGSTON ROVERS'S DEFENCE HAS 
BEEN TERRIFIC IT WAS ASPINWALL WHO CANNOT TAKE 
THE CHANCES HE HAS JUST PUT IT OUT 
OF PLAY 
NEWTON AGAIN WITH THE PLAY 
HE IS GOING TO BE MAKING A STRONG 
CASE FOR MAN OF THE MATCH ISN'T 
HE BY THE WAY IT IS YOUR JOB TO 
CHEESEMAN OF THE MATCH EXCELLENT EXCELLENT CHOOSE MAN OF THE MATCH 
YOU CAN 
TELL US LATER BE GROUNDING IS THE QUESTION HERE 
A DO NOTHING THERE IS ANY PROBLEM 
WITH THAT 
I DO NOT THINK THAT 
WAS SUBLIME FROM CLINT NEWTON YOU 
CAN SEE WHY THE REFEREE WENT FOR IT 
DOWNWARD PRESSURE HE SLAMMED THE 
BALL ON TO THE GRAND HE HAS RELIED 
ON THE PLAYER GROUND 
HIS SHIP 
JUST ABOUT BE IT THIS AND SHOOT 
THE VIDEO REFEREE HAS CONFIRMED 
THAT HULL KINGSTON ROVERS OR HULL 
KINGSTON ROVERS HAVE SEALED IT HERE IT COMES FIVE ADD OF SEVEN 
IT IS POINTS OUT 
THE INSIDE 
PERSON IS GOING TO FIND HIMSELF A 
CLEAR RUN IN ON THE BACK OF CLINT 
NEWTON THERE WAS GREAT AWARENESS 
HE IS PLAYING WELL THAT WAS NICE 
PLAY 
HUDDERSFIELD WENT SHORT WITH PLAY THE RESTART IT IS PLAY ON UNTIL 
HAD SIN HAS DROPPED IT HUDSON IT HAS BEEN A GOOD DAY FOR HULL 
SPORT FANS THEY WON IN THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP PLAY OFFS HAD HIS FILL DE'S HEARTS ARE WELL 
AND TRULY BROKEN HUDDERSFIELD 
IT WAS FISHER THEY HAVE BROKEN THE 
FORTY POINTS BARRIER HUDDERSFIELD ARE 
BEDRAGGLED THAT WAS SMART PLAY FROM A HULL K. R. 
NETHERTON PICKED THE FISHER 
WAS BACK IN AT THE MIDDLE IT WAS 
SLIPPED SLICK HANDS WIN YOU HAVE 
THE NUMBER SANDY PLACE WHERE LIKE 
THAT IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE FINISH 
WHEN YOU HAVE THE NUMBERS AND YOU 
PLAY SQUARE LIKE THAT THAT HAS DOUBLED THE HAD HIS BEARD 
SCORE HAVE THEY BEEN TWICE AS GOOD 
TODAY HUDDERSFIELD 
NOT REALLY 
I THINK THERE HAS BEEN AN ELEMENT 
OF LUCK NETHERTON HAS PUSHED 
THROUGH THAT WAS THICK KICK OFF FROM 
ROBINSON AT THIS SECOND ATTEMPT 
THE KICK OFF LET'S FIND OUT WHO 
YOUR MAN OF THE MATCHES 
I THINK IT 
IS CLINT NEWTON MATCH IS HE HAS 
PUT HULL KINGSTON ROVERS ON THE 
FRONT BUT EVERY TIME FRUIT HE 
HAS COME UP WITH THE PIVOTAL 
MOMENTS OF THE GAME FOOT JUST UNDER TWO MINUTES LEFT TO PLAY 
HE IS NEWTON AGAIN HERE IS 
NEWTON AGAIN IT HAS BEEN CASE OF 
A SIMILAR STORY FOR HUDDERSFIELD 
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF BAD PASSES 
IN THE GAME AS WELL JENSEN TACKLED FIVE YARDS FROM HIS 
OWN LINE THERE IS A BITTER DEBATE 
GAP DEVELOPING IT OFF EIGHT GAP 
A BIT OF GAP WALKER HAD IT COVERED VERY SIMPLY 
JUSTIN MORGAN HAS A REPUTATION 
THE CUP THERE WAS A BRAVE DEFEAT 
IN THE SEMI FINALS HE WAS IN 
CHARGE OF HULL K. R. WHEN THEY BEAT 
WARRINGTON A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

HULL KINGSTON ROVERS SIDE HAVE DONE 
A VERY THOROUGH JOB THIS AFTERNOON
