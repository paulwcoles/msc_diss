ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS JOB OR WHAT THAT'S MORE LIKE IT I'LL KILL YOU 
THE MAURICE I KNOW CATCH THEM IF YOU CAN 
TO CELEBRATE ENGLAND ON THIS SAINT GEORGE'S DAY 
WE TOOK SOME OF THE TOP ARTISTS FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY INTO ANOTHER DIFFERENT 
WORLD FROM THEIR OWN TO DISCOVER WHAT A LAND OF CONTRASTS WE LIVE IN 
THEY WERE THEN TO PRODUCE THEIR VERY OWN WORK OF ART INSPIRED BY THAT NEW WORLD 
TOP JAZZ MUSICIAN AND COMPOSER COURTNEY PINE IS LONDON THROUGH AND THROUGH 
WITH WEST INDIAN ROOTS AT THE CORE OF HIS UPBRINGING AND LIFE 
HOLY ISLAND IN THE NORTH SEA JUST OFF THE COAST OF NORTHUMBERLAND 
COULDN'T BE MORE DIFFERENT FROM THE BUSTLING CAPITAL CITY 
WE ASKED COURTNEY TO SPEND THREE DAYS THERE 
AND TO WRITE A BRAND NEW PIECE OF MUSIC INSPIRED BY HIS EXPERIENCES 
THIS IS COURTNEY PINE'S MADE IN ENGLAND 
MY MUSIC IS USUALLY VERY FRENETIC USUALLY VERY BACK BEAT ORIENTATED 
USUALLY ABOUT A VERY IMMEDIATE CALL TO DANCE 
THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE 
IT'S NOT AN EASY THING MAKING THAT COMMITMENT I'M AN INNER CITY NORTH LONDON YOUTH 
AND GOING OUT SOMEWHERE SO DIFFERENT TO MY CULTURAL BACKGROUND COULD BE SO WRONG 
BUT WHEN I ORIGINALLY GOT THE CALL I THOUGHT O. K. YEAH IT MIGHT HAPPEN IT MIGHT NOT 
BUT THE IDEA WHEN WE SPOKE ABOUT IT I THOUGHT WHAT A BRILLIANT IDEA 
THE TOWN MOUSE AND THE COUNTRY MOUSE A JAZZ MUSICIAN 
AND NORTHUMBRIAN FOLK MEETING 
I ALWAYS THINK WITH MUSIC OR WITH LIFE IN GENERAL IF YOU HAVE TWO ELEMENTS 
A THIRD ELEMENT WILL COME OUT SOMETHING DIFFERENT WILL COME OUT 
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
WHEN YOU GET TO HOLY ISLAND AND YOU SEE THIS ROAD GOING OFF INTO THE DISTANCE AND YOU SEE THE SAND ON 
EITHER SIDE AND YOU REALISE THIS REALLY IS AN ISLAND 
YOU ARE TRAPPED THERE YOU ARE OFF IN ANOTHER ZONE 
HOLY ISLAND IS RUGGED AND REMOTE AND IS INHABITED BY JUST ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY PEOPLE 
IT CAN BE REACHED BY ONLY ONE ROAD WHICH IS TOTALLY COVERED BY THE SEA FOR UP TO SEVEN HOURS TWICE A DAY 
ONCE YOU'RE SAFELY ACROSS THAT ESTUARY YOU QUICKLY REALISE THAT YOU'VE STEPPED INTO ANOTHER WORLD 
THE FIRST THING I NOTICED 
AFTER I TOOK OFF MY CITY EARS WAS THE SOUNDS OF THE BIRDS 
YOU COULD HEAR THEM SINGING 
WE SET UP AND I WAS PLAYING ALONG WITH THE BIRDS AND WE WERE IN CONVERSATION FOR A MINUTE 
I THINK FOR ME MUSICALLY SPEAKING I'M EXPLORING A DIFFERENT SIDE 
WE MET KATHRYN TICKELL I THOUGHT SHE WAS A FANTASTIC MUSICIAN 
I KNOW SOME OF HER WORK 
AND I KIND OF WANTED TO FIGURE OUT 
WHAT FOLK MUSIC HAD DONE TO HER 
WHY WAS SHE INSPIRED TO PLAY THE PIPES IN THE WAY THAT SHE'S DONE 
SHE DOESN'T JUST TRY TO PLAY IT IN A TRADITIONAL WAY SHE TRIES TO ADD IT TO 
A MODERN SOUND 
THANKS KATHRYN THAT WAS WONDERFUL AS AN INNER CITY MUSICIAN 
I'VE GROWN UP IN LONDON THE FIRST THING I'VE NOTICED ABOUT HOLY ISLAND IS THE BIRD NOISE 
IT'S USUALLY TRAFFIC AND 
PEOPLE SHOUTING 
DOES NORTHUMBERLAND OR HOLY ISLAND MEAN ANYTHING DIFFERENT OR SPECIAL TO YOU 
YEAH 
I'M A NORTHUMBRIAN MUSICIAN I PLAY THE NORTHUMBRIAN PIPES 
AND I PLAY FOLK MUSIC TRADITIONAL MUSIC OF THIS AREA 
AND TRADITIONAL MUSIC INCLUDES NEW MUSIC AS WELL SO EVEN THE MUSIC I WRITE I SEE THAT AS BEING 
NORTHUMBRIAN AND BASED ON A LONG TRADITION GOING BACK FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS BASED IN THIS AREA 
THE NORTHUMBRIAN PIPES THEY HAVE 
A COLDNESS AND A CLEARNESS THAT I THINK YOU FIND IN THE 
AIR SOMETIMES PLACES LIKE THIS AND WHEN YOU'RE UP ON THE FELL SIDES AND THE HILLSIDES IN NORTHUMBRIA 
IT'S A BIT BLEAK BUT IT'S VERY BEAUTIFUL VERY CLEAR 
SO DO YOU THINK THIS SPOT THIS AREA THIS ZONE HAS SOME KIND OF SPIRITUAL KIND OF ESSENCE 
IT SOUNDS VERY FANCIFUL BUT SOMETIMES YOU'RE JUST WALKING SOMEWHERE AND 
JUST FEELING THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE EVEN 
THOUGH THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF ANYBODY AROUND THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY STRONG 
EM AND I DON'T THINK IT'S 
FOR ME IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE 
RELIGION OR GHOSTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT'S JUST SOMETHING 
SOMETHING BIG AND QUITE POWERFUL 
THAT SOMETIMES IN THE SLOW PIECES I DO TRY AND TAP INTO THAT AND BRING THAT OUT A LITTLE BIT 
I LIKE IT IT FEELS PART OF ME 
IT MAKES YOUR HEART EXPAND A BIT 
YOU'VE GOT MORE SPACE TO BE 
THE FRONT PIECE NOW I'LL SHOW YOU THE KIND OF LENGTH THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH 
YEAH 
HAVING MET KATHRYN I JUST LOVE THE SOUND 
I JUST THOUGHT ALL THAT DEDICATION FOR SUCH A HARD INSTRUMENT TO PLAY 
IT'S VERY INSPIRING TO MEET SOMEBODY LIKE THAT 
I'M USING SOME OF THE ORNAMENTS THE WAY SHE 
TRILLED ON HER INSTRUMENT ON THE PIPES IN THE SAXOPHONE 
USUALLY I TRY TO HEAR TUNES OR MELODIES OR THE WAY PEOPLE SPEAK AND TRY AND MIMIC IT IN MY MUSIC 
FOR ME IT WAS A MATTER OF MIXING THE SCALES THE RHYTHM 
THE HARMONY TO THE STORIES THAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE PLACE 
TALKING TO SOME OF THE NATIVES ON THE ISLAND GAVE ME MORE OF 
AN INSIGHT IN TERMS OF HOW THE DIRECTION OF THE MUSIC SHOULD GO 
SO HOW DO THE NORMAL THINGS YOU KNOW GROCERIES POST GET TO THE ISLAND 
ARE THERE PROBLEMS WITH THE TIDE 
IT'S GOT TO 
FIT IN WITH THE TIDE TIMES 
SO SOME DAYS MILK AND BREAD HAVE GOT TO BE EARLIER SOMETIMES LATER 
BUT THE TIDE CHANGES EVERY DAY SO 
OBVIOUSLY YOU'LL NEED TO CONSULT THE TIDES BEFORE YOU CAN MAKE DELIVERIES I SEE YOUNGSTERS 
WHAT'S THEIR LIFESTYLE LIKE 
IF YOU'RE NINE ATTENDING A SCHOOL HERE WHAT'S YOUR FUTURE ON HOLY ISLAND 
WELL GOOD QUESTION 
I THINK THE WAY 
I'VE LIVED HERE ALL MY LIFE 
I WENT TO SCHOOL HERE FROM FIVE TILL FIFTEEN LEFT SCHOOL ON THE ISLAND MOST OF US DID THOSE DAYS 
WHEN I WAS IN MY TEENS WE MAINLY STAYED ON THE ISLAND FOUND WORK ON THE ISLAND YES 
BUT NOWADAYS I THINK YOUNGSTERS ARE MORE INCLINED TO WANT TO TRAVEL 
THERE'S BETTER OPPORTUNITIES OFF THE ISLAND 
A LOT OF THE HOMES HAVE BEEN BOUGHT NOW FOR HOLIDAY HOMES 
OR SECOND HOMES WHICH IS NOT JUST A PROBLEM FOR HOLY ISLAND 
PERHAPS WE'VE GOT ABOUT HALF OF THEM HERE ARE 
HOLIDAY HOMES 
IF IT CONTINUES LIKE THIS THEN IS IT JUST GOING TO BECOME A HOLIDAY VILLAGE 
LOCAL YOUNG PEOPLE COULDN'T AFFORD TO BUY THEM 
SO WE FORMED A DEVELOPMENT TRUST AND WE RAISED FUNDS AND WE BUILT 
FIVE BRAND NEW HOMES AND WE CHARGE AFFORDABLE RENTS 
AND THESE HOMES BELONG TO THE ISLAND AND THEY CAN NEVER BE SOLD AND WE'VE GOT LOCAL YOUNG PEOPLE IN 
AS TENANTS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP LOCAL YOUNG PEOPLE ON THE ISLAND 
SO IT SEEMS THAT THE ISOLATION OF HOLY ISLAND MAKES IT A VERY DESIRABLE 
LOCATION FOR THOSE LOOKING FOR HOLIDAY HOMES BY THE SEA 
BUT I CHECKED OUT ITS PAST AND MY RESEARCH TOLD ME THAT HISTORICALLY IT WAS ALWAYS MUCH SOUGHT AFTER 
ORIGINALLY THE AREA WAS INHABITED BY PAGANS RULED BY A GUY CALLED ETHELFRID 
BUT HE WAS KILLED IN BATTLE AND HIS SONS FLED TO IONA IN SCOTLAND WHERE THEY WERE BROUGHT UP MY MONKS 
LATER THE SONS RETURNED AND BROUGHT THEIR KINDLY MONKS WITH THEM 
I MET BROTHER DAMIAN NOW THE ISLAND'S RESIDENT MONK 
THE BANNER OR THE POST OR THE SIGN OUT FRONT SAYS 
IT'S THE CRADLE OF CHRISTIANITY 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WELL IF YOU GO BACK INTO THE HISTORY 
THIS AREA WAS PAGAN IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY YES 
CHRISTIANITY WAS GETTING STRONG ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF SCOTLAND 
THIS WAS NOT KNOWN TO BE A CHRISTIAN AREA AT ALL 
THE MONKS WERE UP IN IONA AND THE YOUNG PRINCE WHEN HIS FATHER DIED 
FROM BAMBURGH HERE WHEN HE WAS IN EXILE MET THE MONKS 
WHEN HE CAME BACK AS KING HE'D WON A BATTLE HE CAME BACK HERE AS 
KING OF NORTHUMBRIA AND HE SAID I WANT THOSE MONKS 
AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE MONASTERY SIX HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE 
FROM THERE THERE WAS A SCHOOL AND A GREAT EXPANSION OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH FROM THIS ISLAND 
SADLY FOR THOSE EARLY MONKS IT APPEARED THAT HOLY ISLAND WAS ALWAYS DESIRABLE FOR A SHORT VISIT 
THIS TIME THOUGH FROM A RATHER MORE UNSAVOURY BUNCH FROM ACROSS THE NORTH SEA 
I THINK THIS PLACE IS VERY FAMOUS FOR THE FACT THAT THE VIKINGS CAME AND HAD A BIT OF A GO 
YES THEY DESTROYED THE MONASTERY 
IT'S THE MONASTERY THAT ESTABLISHED THE NAME HOLY ISLAND 
FOR ONE HUNDRED SIXTY YEARS THESE MONKS LIVED HAPPILY AND QUIETLY HERE 
ENJOYING THE REMOTENESS OF THE PLACE 
THEN THIS CULTURE SHOCK THIS HIT AND RUN RAID SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY THREE 
EIGHTH JUNE VIKING RAID AND THE THING CHANGED COMPLETELY 
THIS IS A CHANGING WORLD 
SO WHY DID THEY DO THAT 
IT WAS RAVAGING WE TALK ABOUT THE VIKINGS AS IF THEY'RE ALL ONE KIND OF PEOPLE 
THESE CAME FROM NORWAY PROBABLY THE STAVANGER AREA 
IT WAS LITERALLY A RAIDING PARTY THEY WANTED LOOT THEY WANTED THE GOOD THINGS THAT THE MONASTERY HAD 
AND THEY TOOK AWAY SLAVES AS WELL THEY TOOK YOUNG BOYS AWAY FROM THE MONASTERY TO ACT AS SLAVES 
LATER ON OF COURSE THE VIKINGS CAME TO SETTLE IN THE COUNTRY BUT THESE WERE JUST RAIDERS 
I ALWAYS LIKE STUDYING ANCIENT THINGS 
I HAVE THIS THING A TIME BEFORE TIME WAS TIME 
SO HOW FAR CAN YOU GO BACK 
THE FURTHER YOU GO BACK THE MORE YOU CAN GO TO THE FUTURE 
SO GOING INTO THE HOLY ISLAND AND BEING AT THE PARISH AND 
SEEING THE OLD STRUCTURES SEEING THE CASTLE IN THE BACKGROUND AND THIS PLACE IS STILL EXISTING 
THESE ARE THE STORIES THAT HAVE INSPIRED ME 
I TRIED TO IMAGINE BEING ON THE BOAT COMING TO THIS HOLY ISLAND WHERE THEY'VE GOT NO IDEA YOU'RE COMING 
SO THERE'S LOTS OF ROWING 
WAVES GOING ON 
DRUMS PLAYING THE LOW TOMS 
THAT'S THE VIKING THEME 
BAR NINETEEN 
IF YOU COULD PUT A BIG CRASH ON THERE 
SO YOU'RE DEFINITELY A RAIDER NOT SOMEONE WAITING TO BE RAIDED ON 
I'M FROM NORTH LONDON YOU KNOW HOW WE DO IT 
ONE TWO 
WE HAD AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH THE WIND 
IT WAS AMAZING BECAUSE YOU COULD SEE PATTERNS IN THE SAND 
THINGS LIKE THESE INSPIRE ME AS AN ARTIST 
THEY'RE PATTERNS 
IT'S NATURE SHOWING ITSELF FOR ME 
NATURE REALLY DOES SHOUT THE LOUDEST ON THIS REMOTE ISLAND 
THE SEA CAN BE FIERCE AND YOU REALLY DO HAVE TO BELIEVE THE WARNING SIGNS IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ON OR OFF 
I DID THINK WHAT IF I WAS DRIVING DOWN THIS PLACE AND I GOT TRAPPED THERE 
WHAT WOULD I DO BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS EASY AS SEEING THIS LONG PATH AND GETTING IN YOUR CAR 
AND DOING SEVENTY EIGHTY MILES AN HOUR AND GETTING TO THE OTHER SIDE QUICKLY 
YOU ACTUALLY DRIVE DOWN THAT ROAD 
AND IT LOOKS COOL BUT THEN AT THE LAST MINUTE THE WATER 
STEAMS IN AND IT STOPS THE ENGINE AND THAT'S WHEN YOU'VE HAD IT 
IF IT DOES HAPPEN THERE'S ALWAYS THE SAFETY OF THE WOODEN HUT 
REACHED BY A LADDER AND THEN IT'S UP TO THE R. A. F. TO COME AND GET YOU 
PEOPLE TRY TO DRIVE ACROSS THE CAUSEWAY 
IT'S GENERALLY PEOPLE GETTING OFF THE ISLAND BACK TO THE MAINLAND 
THEY GET HALFWAY AND THE CAR CONKS OUT BECAUSE OF THE WATER 
AND THEY THEN CALL FOR HELP 
THE POLICE CAN'T DO A GREAT DEAL BECAUSE THEY CAN'T DRIVE THEIR CARS 
IN EITHER SO THEY THEN CALL US AND WE LAUNCH OFF FROM HERE 
BY THE TIME WE GET THERE IT TAKES TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES TO FLY UP THERE THEY'VE CLIMBED OUT OF THE 
CAR AND GONE UP INTO THE LITTLE REFUGE HUT AND THEY'RE SAT THERE WAITING FOR US TO ARRIVE 
THEY'RE NOT GENERALLY HURT OR INJURED OR ILL OR ANYTHING THEY'RE JUST EMBARRASSED AND STUCK 
WE WINCH THEM INTO THE AIRCRAFT AND THEN 
TAKE THEM TO THE MAINLAND WHERE THEY GET INTERVIEWED BY THE POLICE 
I'D LIKE TO KNOW HAVE YOU EVER BEEN STRANDED OUT HERE ON THE ISLAND 
BECAUSE I'M HEARING SOME HORROR STORIES OF CARS BEING STRANDED 
NO IT'S NO HORROR STORY 
IT'S WHAT YOU AIM FOR WHEN YOU COME TO HOLY ISLAND 
I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN STRANDED AND IT WAS KIND OF ON PURPOSE 
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE TIMES WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO GO HOME AND THE ANSWERING MACHINE'S GOING TO BE 
GOING AND THERE'S GOING TO BE LOADS OF PEOPLE WANTING YOU TO DO THINGS 
ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF AND THEN YOU GET OUT HERE AND THINK OH WHOOPS 
KATHRYN HAS A SENSE OF BEING CONTROLLED BY THE TIDE 
WHICH WAS ENLIGHTENING TO ME BECAUSE I STILL HAVE CITY FEET IN TERMS OF 
GETTING TO THE NEXT GIG ON TIME MAKING SURE I GET THE DEADLINE GET EVERYTHING DONE ON TO THE NEXT JOB 
AND SHE SAYS IF YOU GO TO HOLY ISLAND MAYBE SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO BE STUCK THERE 
BECAUSE THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE HUSTLE AND BUSTLE OF OUTSIDE HOLY ISLAND LIFE 
THE IDEA OF BEING TRAPPED BY THE TIDE FOR A FEW HOURS OF CONTEMPLATION 
SEEMED LIKE A WONDERFUL THING BUT WHAT IF YOU LIVE ON THE ISLAND 
SURELY BEING STRANDED COULD BE A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH 
I'VE BEEN HERE A FEW DAYS NOW AND ONE THING THAT 
HAS CAUGHT MY IMAGINATION IS THE SAND AND THE FACT THAT YOUR LIFE IS 
BASED AROUND WHETHER THE TIDE IS IN OR OUT 
WHAT'S IT LIKE IN THIS DAY AND AGE FOR YOU TO GET ABOUT IN TERMS OF GOING TO HOSPITALS 
GETTING OFF THE ISLAND 
HOW DO YOU GET AROUND THAT 
WELL FOR ME 
I HAVE TWO SONS WHO HAVE CARS WHO COULD TAKE ME BUT WITH THEIR WORK 
AND ARRANGING THE TIDES AND ARRANGING HOSPITAL VISITS DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK OUTWHATEVER 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SOMEBODY WAS TO HAVE A BABY ON THE ISLAND 
ARE THERE ANY 
MIDWIVES ON THE ISLAND IS THERE 
A MEDICAL OFFICE 
NO NO 
NOWADAYS IF THE TIDE'S UP THEN THEY'RE WHIPPED OFF BY HELICOPTER 
YOU'VE HAD CHILDREN HERE ON THE ISLAND YES I'VE HAD THEM ALL HERE 
THE DOCTOR WAS EIGHTY ONE YEARS OLD 
IF HE HAD TRANSPORT IT WOULD BE DOWN TO THE SHORE 
THEN SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE TO BRING HIM OVER HERE 
AND GET HIM TO MY DOOR AND IN HERE 
ARTHUR WAS THE FIRST ONE HE WAS BORN IN THIS ROOM 
AND THEN I HAD ANOTHER SON 
AND THE DOCTOR WAS EIGHTY SIX BY THIS TIME WHEN DELIVERED HIM 
SO SYLVIA WHEN DID YOU COME TO HOLY ISLAND WHAT YEAR 
EASTER NINETEEN FORTY THREE 
I GOT MARRIED AND I CAME TO LIVE HERE 
I HAD TO COME OVER BY HORSE AND TRAP AND I HAD 
TO LIVE WITH MY MOTHER IN LAW FOR A YEAR TILL WE GOT THIS 
WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND DO HE WAS A FISHERMAN 
O. K. 
INSHORE FISHING DID YOU EVER GO ON THE FISHING BOATS WITH HIM 
YES ONCE OR TWICE 
AND DID YOU ENJOY IT NO I DIDN'T 
I DIDN'T SEE MUCH OF ANYTHING AT ALL 
I DIDN'T LIKE THE MOTION OF THE SEA 
I'VE GOT TO ASK YOU ABOUT MUSIC OF COURSE 
HAVE YOU YEAH DO YOU LIKE MUSIC I LOVE MUSIC 
WHAT INSTRUMENT DO YOU PLAY PIANO 
WERE YOU SELF TAUGHT SELF TAUGHT 
O. K. SO WHAT KIND OF THINGS WOULD YOU PLAY IS THERE ANYTHING LOCAL 
NO I USED TO GO FOR ALL THE WALTZES DANUBE DESERT SONG AND WARSAW CONCERTO 
PIPES PLAY 
I TELL YOU WHAT I USED TO LIKE TO HEAR THE BAGPIPES 
THERE USED TO BE SOMEBODY WHO PLAYED BAGPIPES 
AND THE SOUND DRIFTING ACROSS THE WATER IT WAS OUT OF THE CASTLE IT USED TO BE LOVELY 
OF THE BLUE DANUBE 
LOVELY YOU'RE SYNCOPATING 
I TRY GOOD 
I TRY EVERYTHING YOU HAD A BIT OF THE BLUE DANUBE IN THERE AHHHH 
SYLVIA IS AMAZING 
SHE'S EIGHTY SOMETHING 
WALKED INTO HER COTTAGE AND THE FIRST THING SHE SAID WAS THAT SHE LIKED MY HAT 
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'D SEEN A DREADLOCK HAT LIKE THAT BEFORE BUT INSTANTLY SHE LIKED IT 
THERE'S A LOT OF GOODNESS OOZING OUT OF SYLVIE 
WHEN YOU GO TO SOMEWHERE LIKE HOLY ISLAND YOU GO OUT THERE YOU WALK YOU TALK 
AND YOU CHILL AND YOU BECOME CLOSER TO NATURE 
I THINK IF YOU LIVE IN THE CITY YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE NATURE IS JUST A BYSTANDER 
WE'RE RUN BY ELECTRICITY WE'RE RUN BY THE T. V. NEWS 
NATURE IS VERY MUCH A SECOND THIRD CLASS CITIZEN 
BUT WHEN YOU GO TO SOMEWHERE LIKE HOLY ISLAND AND NATURE IS IN FRONT OF YOU 
IT'S STOPPING YOU FROM LEAVING THE ISLAND 
NATURE IS ACTUALLY A MUCH MORE STRONGER PART OF YOUR LIFE 
AND FOR ME AS A MUSICIAN TO GO TO HOLY ISLAND AND HEAR 
MY EARS ARE TUNED TO LISTENING TO SOUNDS AND NATURE WAS SO LOUD THERE FOR ME 
I THINK IT'S A GREAT THING 
THE MUSIC THAT WAS WRITTEN WAS DEFINITELY BROKEN INTO SEPARATE PARTS 
EACH PIECE EACH MOMENT IS OUT OF THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING ON HOLY ISLAND 
I THINK THE FEW DAYS THAT I WAS THERE DID GIVE ME A DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT MYSELF AS BEING ENGLISH 
FOR ME IT'S ABOUT THE EXPERIENCES FROM AN INNER CITY LONDON YOUTH GOING TO A PLACE THAT HE 
WOULD NEVER GO AND THROUGH MUSIC REPRESENTING THE SOUND OF BOTH PLACES AT THE SAME TIME 
THIS WAS A VERY SPECIAL UNIQUE OCCASION 
TO BE SO CLOSE TO AN ENVIRONMENT THAT I WOULD NOT USUALLY BE IN AND TO LEARN FROM THAT EXPERIENCE 
WHETHER THAT'S WALKING DOWN A PATH 
HEARING THE FREQUENCIES IN THE AIR 
WHETHER IT'S LEARNING FROM THE STORIES ABOUT HOW THIS ISLAND HAS SURVIVED 
WHETHER THAT'S TALKING TO DICK ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCES BEING ON THE ISLAND 
I THINK UM 
I CAN ONLY GROW FROM THAT EXPERIENCE 
FOLKS WHO DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS PART OF ENGLAND EXISTED 
YOU'VE ONLY GOT TO SEE IT 
TO FEEL PROUD ABOUT IT 
IT'S AN AMAZING STORY 
THE MONKS THE PILGRIMS THE VIKINGS 
EVEN THE STORIES ABOUT THE FISHERMEN 
AND IT'S STILL GOING IT'S A GREAT STORY 
I THINK THIS TOWN MOUSE HAS DEFINITELY CHANGED
