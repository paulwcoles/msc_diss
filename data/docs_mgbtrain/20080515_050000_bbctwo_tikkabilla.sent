THERE'S THE TIKKABILLA CLOCK 
COME ON LET'S SWIM OVER THERE 
TIKKABILLA 
TOCKABILLA 
TIKKABILLA 
TOCK 
WHAT'S THE TIME ON THE TIKKABILLA CLOCK 
THE LONG HAND IS POINTING UP TO THE NUMBER TWELVE 
SO THAT MEANS IT'S SOMETHING O'CLOCK 
AND THE SHORT HAND 
IS POINTING TO THE NUMBER 
SEVEN 
SO THAT MEANS IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK 
BUT WHAT'S UNDERNEATH 
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FISH 
WITH SHINY SCALES 
AND THE STORY'S CALLED 
THE RAINBOW FISH 
A LONG WAY OUT IN THE DEEP BLUE SEA THERE LIVED A FISH 
NOT JUST AN ORDINARY FISH 
HE WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FISH IN THE ENTIRE OCEAN 
HIS SCALES WERE EVERY SHADE OF BLUE AND GREEN AND PURPLE 
WITH SPARKLING SILVER SCALES AMONG THEM 
THE OTHER FISH WERE AMAZED AT HIS BEAUTY 
THEY CALLED HIM RAINBOW FISH 
COME ON RAINBOW FISH THEY WOULD CALL 
COME AND PLAY WITH US 
BUT THE RAINBOW FISH WOULD JUST GLIDE PAST 
PROUD AND SILENT LETTING HIS SCALES SHIMMER 
ONE DAY A LITTLE BLUE FISH FOLOOWED AFTER HIM 
RAINBOW FISH HE CALLED WAIT FOR ME 
PLEASE GIVE ME ONE OF YOUR SHINY SCALES 
THEY ARE SO WONDERFUL AND YOU HAVE SO MANY 
YOU WANT ME TO GIVE YOU ONE OF MY SPECIAL SCALES 
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE CRIED THE RAINBOW FISH 
GET AWAY FROM ME 
SHOCKED THE LITTLE BLUE FISH SWAM AWAY 
HE WAS SO UPSET 
HE TOLD ALL HIS FRIENDS WHAT HAD HAPPENED 
F. RO MTHE N. O. N. 
NO ONE WOULD HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE RAINBOW FISH 
THEY TURNED AWAY WHEN HE SWAM BY 
WHAT GOOD WERE THE DAZZLING SHIMMERING SCALES 
WITH NO ONE TO ADMIRE THEM 
NOW HE WAS THE LONELIEST FISH IN THE ENTIRE OCEAN 
ONE DAY HE POURED OUT HIS TROUBLES TO THE STARFISH 
I REALLY A. M. BEAUTIFUL WHY DOESN'T ANYBODY LIKE ME 
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT FOR YOU SAID THE STARFISH 
BUT IF YOU GO BEYOND THE CORAL REEF TO A DEEP CAVE 
YOU WILL FIND THE WISE OCTUPUS 
MAYBE SHE CAN HELP YOU 
THE RAINBOW FISH FOUND THE CAVE 
IT WAS VERY DARK INSIDE 
AND HE COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING 
THEN SUDDENLY TWO EYES CAUGHT HIM IN THEIR GLARE 
AND THE OCTOPUS EMERGED FROM THE DARKNESS 
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU SAID THE OCTOPUS WITH A DEEP VOICE 
THE WAVES HAVE TOLD ME YOUR STORY THIS IS MY ADVICE 
GIVE A GLITTERING SCALE TO EACH OF THE OTHER FISH 
YOU WILL NO LONGER BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FISHIN THE SEA 
BUT YOU WILL DISCOVER HOW TO BE HAPPY 
I CAN'T THE RAINBOW FISH STARTED TO SAY 
BUT THE COTOPUS HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED 
INTO A DARK CLOUD OF INK 
GIVE AWAY MY SCALES 
MY BEAUTIFUL SHINING SCALES 
NEVER 
HOW COULD I EVER BE HAPPY WITHOUT THEM 
SUDDENLY HE FELT THE LIGHT TOUCH OF A FIN 
THE LITTLE BLUE FISH WAS BACK 
RAINBOW FISH PLEASE DON'T BE ANGRY 
I JUST WANT ONE LITTLE SCALE 
THE RAINBOW FISH WAVERED 
ONLY ONE VERY SMALL SHIMMERY SCALE H. M. M. HE THOUGHT 
WELL MAYBE I WOULDN'T MISS JUST ONE 
CAREFULLY THE RAINBOW FISH PULLED OUT THE SMALLEST SCALE 
AND GAVE IT TO THE LITTLE FISH 
OH THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE LITTLE BLUE FISH BUBBLED PLAYFULLY 
AS HE TUCKED THE SHINE SCALE IN AMONG HIS BLUE ONES 
A RATHER PECULIAR FEELING CAME OVER THE RAINBOW FISH 
FOR A LONG TIME HE WATCHED THE LITTLE BLUE FISH SWIM BACK AND FORTH 
WITH HIS NEW SCALE GLITTERING IN THE WATER 
THE LITTLE BLUE FISH WHIZZED THROUGH THE OCEAN WITH HIS SCALE FLASHING 
SO BEFORE LONG THE RAINBOW FISH WAS SURROUNDED BY THE OTHER FISH 
EVERYONE WANTED A GLITTERING SCALE 
THE RAINBOW FISH SHARED HIS SCALES LEFT AND RIGHT 
AND THE MORE HE GAVE AWAY THE MORE DELIGHTED HE BECAME 
WHEN THE WATER AROUND HIM FILLED WITH GLIMMERING SCALES 
HE AT LAST FELT AT HOME AMONG THE OTHER FISH 
FINALLY THE RAINBOW FISH HAD ONLY ONE SHINING SCALE LEFT 
HIS MOST PRIZED POSSESSIONS HAD BEEN GIVEN AWAY 
YET HE WAS VERY HAPPY 
COME ON RAINBOW FISH THEY CALLED 
COME AND PLAY WITH US 
HERE I COME SAID THE RAINBOW FISH 
AND HAPPY AS A SPLASH HE SWAM OFF TO JOIN HIS FRIENDS 
THAT FISH HAD SOME BEAUTIFUL COLOURFUL SCALES DIDN'T IT 
NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME COLOURS 
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO USE CRAYONS OR PAINTS 
I'M GOING TO USE THIS LITTLE OBJECT 
THIS IS CALLED A PRISM 
NOW I'M GONNA PLACE THE PRISM ON THIS CARD 
AND I'M GONNA TAKE A TORCH AND SWITCH IT ON 
NOW I'M GONNA SWITCH THE LIGHTS OFF FOR THIS 
YOU CAN SEE IT BETTER NOW 
THIS TORCH HAS A WHITE LIGHT 
LOOK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I SHINE IT ONTO THE PRISM 
IF YOU LOOK OVER HERE 
CAN YOU SEE 
THE COLOURS 
AREN'T THEY BEAUTIFUL 
THERE 
RIGHT 
I'LL SWITCH THE LIGHTS BACK ON NOW 
AND THE TORCH OFF 
NOW YOU CAN CREATE SOME COLOURS OF YOUR OWN 
WITH OTHER THINGS LIKE THIS C. D. 
IF I HOLD THIS C. D. UP 
AND MOVE IT SLIGHTLY 
CAN YOU SEE IT 
IT HAS SOME LOVELY COLOURS ON IT 
MOVING AROUND THE C. D. 
NOW I'VE GOT ANOTHER OBJECT TO SHOW YOU 
THIS IS A VERY UNUSUAL OBJECT 
WITH A VERY UNUSUAL NAME 
IT'S CALLED A ZOETROPE 
INSIDE THE ZOETROPE IS A STRIP OF PAPER 
AND ALONG THE PAPER IS A SERIES OF DRAWINGS 
EACH DRAWING IS DIFFERENT 
WE'VE GOT A CHARACTER JUMPING UP IN THE AIR HERE 
AND THEN LANDING BACK DOWN ON THE GROUND 
BUT IF WE PUT IT INSIDE THE ZOETROEE AND GIVE IT A SPIN 
SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
THE CHARACTER APPEARS TO BE MOVING 
CAN YOU SEE 
IT'S JUMPING UP AND DOWN 
RIGHT LET'S PUT ANOTHER STRIP INSIDE THE ZOETROPE SHALL WE 
I'VE GOT SOME EYES HERE 
OPENING AND CLOSING 
LET'S SEE WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE 
INSIDE THE ZOETROPE LET'S SPIN IT 
CAN YOU SEE 
THE EYES ARE SHUTTING AND OPENING 
IT'S MAKING ME FEEL VERY SLEEPY

TEDDY AND ELLIE ARE TIRED AFTER THEIR LONG VOYAGE 
SO I'M GOING TO SING THEM A SONG TO HELP THEM SLEEP 
AS YOU CURL UP IN YOUR BED 
AFTER YOU CLOSE THE BOOK YOU'VE READ 
AS YOU CURL UP NICE AND TIGHT 
AND FEEL THE COMING OF THE NIGHT 
LET YOUR EYELIDS START TO CLOSE 
GIVE A WRIGGLE OF YOOUR NOSE 
THEN DRIFT OFF INTO DEEPEST DEEP 
THE WARMEST SWEETEST DREAMIEST SLEEP 
DREAM YOUR BED IS A BEAUTIFUL BOAT 
FEEL IT RISE AND FEEL IT FLOAT 
DREAM THAT IT CROSSES THE WIDEST SEA 
BUT GETS BACK HOME IN TIME FOR TEA 
DREAM YOUR PILLOW IS A CLOUD 
FEEL IT FLOATING OVER A CROWD 
SEE THE FACES FAR BELOW 
FACES OF PEOPLE OF FRIENDS THAT YOU KNOW 
DREAM OF COLOURS OF BALLS OF TOYS 
DREAM OF OTHER GIRLS AND BOYS 
SEE THEM DANCING SEE THEM RUN 
SEE YOURSELF JOINING IN WITH THE FUN 
DREAM OF ANIMALS BIRDS AND BEES 
DREAM OF WIND ROCKED WAVING TREES 
WITH GOLDEN LEAVES THAT START TO FALL 
UNTIL THE MORNING COMES TO CALL 
THEN AS YOU WAKE UP IN YOUR BED 
SOME LAZY DREAMS REST IN YOUR HEAD 
AS YOU RISE READY TO PLAY 
THOSE DREAMS ALL SEEM TO FLOAT AWAY 
BUT NEVER WORRY NEVER FRET 
YOUR DREAM TIME IS NOT OVER YET 
FOR COME THE EVENING COME THE NIGHT 
NEW DREAMS WILL GREET YOU 
CLEAR AND BRIGHT 
AH DON'T THEY LOOK COMFY 
YEAH REALLY COSY 
WE WISH YOU A WONDERFUL DREAMTIME TOO 
WE'LL SEE YOU VERY SOON 
ALL BYE BYE
