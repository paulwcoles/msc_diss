MAKE SOLDIERS STRONGER SAFER AND 
SEEMED FITTER WEARING THE ROBOTIC 
OUTFIT HE CAN EASILY LIFT MORE

USED FOR CARRYING PAYLOADS IT CAN 
BE USED ON THE BATTLEFIELD TO 
REMOVE INJURED SOLDIERS 
STEADY AS

OF WORK TO BE DONE IT WILL BE AT 
LEAST EIGHT YEARS UNTIL THEY ARE 
USED 
PEOPLE ARE OBSESSED WITH THIS USED KIND OF IDEA OF ADDING CAPABILITY
