GORDON BROWN ON COLLISION COURSE 
WITH LABOUR'S TAX REBELS DESPITE 
MORE CRITICISM OVER THE CUT IN THE 
TEN P. TAX RATE THE GOVERNMENT DENIES 
IT'S PLANNING A CLIMBDOWN 
TWO MORE CONTROLLED EXPLOSIONS 
AFTER THE ARREST OF A TERROR 
SUSPECT IN BRISTOL 
A PARTIAL RECOUNT OF VOTES IN 
ZIMBABWE THE OP PIGS CLAIM IT'S 
THE LATEST ATTEMPT TO STEAL THE 
ELECTION AND THE BIG SHOWDOWN 
THOUSANDS OF FANS ARE IN LAS VEGAS 
TO SEE IF JOE CALZAGHE CAN DO THE 
BUSINESS 
GOOD EVENING GORDON BROWN IS 
FACING MORE CRITICISM TONIGHT FROM 
LABOUR M. P.'S OVER SCRAPPING THE TEN P. 
INCOME TAX RATE ONE HAS CALLED ON 
MINISTERS TO CLEAR THE FOG OF 
CONFUSION OVER THEIR HANDLING OF 
THE CHANGE MANY ARE WARNING THAT 
MILLIONS OF LOW PAID WORKERS WILL 
BE WORSE OFF DOWNING STREET HAS 
DENIED IT'S NOW PLANNING TO OFFER 
THEM CONCESSIONS 
GORDON BROWN'S SAID TO BE FURIOUS 
THAT WHILE HE'S BEEN AWAY IN 
AMERICA LABOUR M. P.'S HAVE BEEN 
STOKING REBELLION AT HOME BUT IT'S 
THE M. P.'S WHO HAVE BEEN FACING THE 
FLAK FROM VOTERS AND THEY WANT 
NUMBER TEN TO REACT 
A FOG OF 
CONFUSION HAS DESCENDED ON THIS 
ISSUE AND IT NEEDS CLEARING BY THE 
GOVERNMENT I THINK THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS TO BE VERY CLEAR IN SENDING OUT 
A MESSAGE THAT THEY'RE NOT OUT TO 
PENALISE THE POORER MEMBERS OF 
SOCIETY SOCIETY THESE YOUNG MEN ENJOYING GAME OF 
POOL IN WETHERBY IN WEST YORKSHIRE 
ARE TYPICAL OF THE ESTIMATED FIVE 
MILLION PEOPLE WHO COULD BE TWO HUNDRED A 
YEAR A YEAR WORSE OFF 
THAT MAKES THEM ANGRY 
PEOPLE ON 
OUR WAGE CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE 
ANYMORE IT'S AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE 
IT'S NOT A LOT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE 
BUT TO ME IT'S CONSIDERABLE 
AMOUNT I WOULDN'T BE WILLING TO 
LOSE THAT 
AS COMPLAINTS GROW SOME 
MINISTERIAL AIDES ARE OPENINGLY 
DEMANDING CHANGE AND BRIEFLY SEEM 
TO BE PROMISED IT BY A TREASURY 
MINISTER LAST LAST NIGHT 
IS THERE 
GOING TO BE A COMPENSATION PACKAGE 
WE'RE LISTENING AND WE'RE LOOKING 
AND YOU MUST WATCH THIS SPACE 
GORDON BROWN MAY WELL BE RETURNING 
TO AN IN TRAY BULGING WITH LETTERS 
FROM DISGRUNTLED LABOUR M. P.'S AND 
THEY'LL ALL BE ASKING FOR ONE 
THING RETHINK OF THE TEN P. TAX 
DECISION AND IT SOMETHING MR. BROWN 
IS ADAMANT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET 
IT'S ALSO REGISTERING NEXT DOOR AT 
NUMBER ELEVEN DOWNING STREET AND 
TREASURY OFFICIALS ARE 
WORKINGANTCALLY BEHIND THE SCENES 
TO FIND WAY OUT OF THIS HOLE IN 
THE MONTHS AHEAD NUMBER TEN SAYS 
THE REBELS ARE WRONG MOST PEOPLE 
WILL BE BETTER OFF BECAUSE THE 
BASIC RATE OF TAX HAS BEEN LOWERED 
FROM TWENTY TWO PER CENT TO TWENTY PER CENT INCREASED TAX 
CREDITS AND KEEPING THE TEN P. RATE 
WOULD COST SEVEN BILLION 
IT'S PART OF 
THE PACKAGE OF COURSE WE'LL 
CONTINUE TO DO MORE TO HELP THOSE 
ON LOW INCOME DO THAT IN FUTURE 
AND PRE BUDGET REPORTS THAT THAT SUGGESTS NO MOVE YET VOTERS MAY 
GIVE THEIR VERDICT FIRST
