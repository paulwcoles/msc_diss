THE COST OF GORDON BROWN'S 
AUTHORITY TEN P. HOW GOOD IS HIS 
CREDIT WITH HIS PARTY 
AUTHORITY TEN P. HOW GOOD IS HIS CREDIT WITH HIS PARTY 
TONIGHT GORDON BROWN DOES STILL 
COMMAND THE LOYALTY OF HIS PARTY 
BUT HE HAS HAD TO AELT EAT HUMBLE 
PIE AS HE COMES TO TERMS WITH THE 
DEPTH OF THE HOLE HE HAS DUG 
HIMSELF WITH THE ABOLITION OF THE 
TEN P. RATE OF INCOME TAX WE TALK TO 
ONE OF THE LEADING REBELS ABOUT 
WHETHER HE'S PERSUADED AND THE 
LATEST ATTEMPT TO FIGHT THE CREDIT 
CRISIS BY THE LING 
BANK OF 
ENGLAND FIFTY BILLION THAT'S WHAT 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND PROMISES TO 
EASE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS HOW MUCH 
WILL IT HELP MORTGAGE HOLDERS AND AND WE TALK ABOUT THE LIKE PRESIDENT 
CARTER ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF A 
MIDDLE EAST PEACE AND THIS 
WOMAN IS SERVING LIFE FOR MURDERING 
A TWO YEAR OLD CHILD WHY DOES ONE 
OF THE INVESTIGATING POLICE 
OFFICERS BELIEVE IN COULD HAVE BEEN 
A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE 
GOOD EVENING THE PRIME MINISTER 
SCURRIED INTO A SESSION WITH HIS 
M. P.'S TONIGHT ATTEMPTING TO REGAIN 
THEIR CONFIDENCE AS SOME OPENLY 
WONDER WHAT IS GOING ON IN HIS 
GOVERNMENT THE ANGER OVER THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. RATE OF INCOME 
TAX THE MEASURE WHEN HE INTRODUCED 
IT HE TRUMPETED AS BEING ABOUT 
HELPING SOME OF THE LEAST WELL OFF 
IN SOCIETY HAS GIVEN A FOCUS OF 
DISQUIET ABOUT DRIFT AND 
UNPOPULARITY AND HIS OWN FOREIGN 
SECRETARY SAYS THE PARTY HAS BECOME 
THE PARTY OF UNDERDOGS TONIGHT ON 
THE TEN P. TAX BAND AFTER A DAY OF 
ACTIVITY IT'S STILL NOT CLEAR IF 
MINISTERS WILL AVOID DEFEAT NEXT 
WEEK WEEK THIS WEEKEND SOME PEOPLE BEGUN 
COMPARING THIS TO THE POLL TAX NOT 
THAT THEY EXPECT STREET RIOTS BUT 
IN THE POWER OF AN UNPOPULAR TAX TO 
BRING DOWN PRIME MINISTERS AS THAT 
FAMOUS TAX HELPED TOPPLE MARGARET 
THATCHER NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AGO THIS 
ISSUE HAS HAD A PARTICULAR POTENCY 
EVER SINCE THE START OF A NEW 
FINANCIAL TAX YEAR WHEN THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. RATE CAME INTO 
EFFECT ADD TO THAT THE RESPONSE 
THAT M. P.'S IN ENGLAND AND WALES HAVE 
HAD WHILE OUT CAMPAIGNING IN THE 
LOCAL ELECTIONS TOGETHER WITH A 
TORRENT OF COMPLAINTS THEY SAY THEY 
HAVE HAD BY POST AND E. MAIL BY 
THEIR CONSTITUENTS 
AND TODAY BEGUN WITH THE FORMER 
HOME SECRETARY CHARLES CLARKE 
MAKING WAVES ON ED BALLS AND 
GOVERNMENT POLICY IN A LETTER TO 
THE TIMES HE WROTE 
ED BALLS TRIED TO BRUSH IT OFF AS 
JOKE 
OUR TEAM NORWICH CITY LOST AT JOKE HOME TO WEST BROM AND I DON'T KNOW 
WHY BUT CHARLES DECIDED TO KICK ME 
RATHER THAN THE DOG 
MORE SERIOUSLY 
MR. BALLS WIFE TRIED TO SUE THE 
LEBLS BY PROMISING NOT A TREASURY 
REVIEW BUT TO INCLUDE LOSERS IN THE 
TAX MEASURE IN A PROGRAMME OF WORK 
ON POVERTY 
WE WANT TO DO MORE FOR 
THOSE ON LOWEST INCOME GIVEN THE 
RESOURCES WE HAVE IN THE ECONOMY AT 
THE TIME WE WILL BE CONSULTING 
WITH STAKE HOLDERS WITH M. P.'S AND 
DIFFERENT GROUPS ON THE NEXT PHASE 
TO TACKLE POVERTY AND UNFAIR 
INEQUALITY IN BRITAIN THIS WORK 
WILL REPORT INITIALLY INTO THE PRE 
BUDGET REPORT AND INTO FUTURE 
BUDGETS AS WELL 
THAT PROGRAMME 
WILL REPORT THIS AUTUMN MANY M. P.'S 
THINK IT'S NOT WERE HELP RIGHT NOW 
DOES SHE ACCEPT THERE ARE MILLIONS 
OF LOW PAID LOSERS WHO AREN'T 
ENTITLED TO TAX CREDITS AND 
MILLIONS MORE WHO ARE BUT THEY 
DON'T CLAIM IT BECAUSE THEIR 
EARNINGS CHANGE FROM WEEK TO WEEK 
AND THEY DON'T WANT TO BE ENMESHED 
IN OVERPAYMENTS AND THEY HAVE TO 
FACE FOOD FUEL AND RENT INCREASES 
THIS WEEK THIS MONTH THEY CAN'T 
WAIT FOR A PACKAGE IN TWO THOU NINE THEY 
NEED IT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
TONIGHT GORDON 
BROWN MADE A LAST MINUTE APPEARANCE 
AT THE WEEKLY MEETING OF LABOUR M. P.'S 
HIS SECOND SUCH VISIT IN THREE WEEK 
HIS POOR PERFORMANCE LAST TIME 
ROUND DID MUCH TO STIR UP THIS 
ISSUE ORIGINALLY WE DO GET IT 
WERE HIS WORDS WE UNDERSTAND 
PEOPLE'S PLIGHT HE SAYS AND 
TREASURY MINISTERS WILL PRODUCE 
HELP BY THE AUTUMN BY MOST 
ACCOUNTS MR. BROWN PERFORMED RATHER 
BETTER THIS EVENING THAN THREE 
WEEKS AGO ACCORDING TO THE FORMER 
MINISTER DENNIS MCSHANEERS MORE 
HUMAN NICER FOR SYMPATHETIC HE 
WASN'T THE AUTHORITARIAN GORDON 
THAN BEFORE AND FRANK FIELD FOUND 
HIMSELF UNDER FEROCIOUS ATTACK FROM 
THE BACKBENCHER GERALD KOR F. 
I'M SICK OF SOME M. P.'S THOUGH 
STILL WANT MORE CONCRETE 
CONCESSIONS AND NOW THE FACT IS IF 
THE BUDGET GOES DOWN IF THIS KEY 
CLAUSE GOES DOWN I DON'T THINK THE 
GOVERNMENT CAN SURVIVE I'M A 
LABOUR M. P. L. WANT THE LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT TO DO THE RIGHT THING 
AND THERE'S A RECOGNITION IT WILL 
INTERVENE PEOPLE WHOEVER LOST OUT 
HAVE TO BE FULLY COMPENSATED AND 
THEY HAVE GOT TO BE TOLD WHEN THEY 
ARE GOING TO GET THEIR MONEY BY THE 
END OF NEXT WEEK 
I THINK GORDON 
PRENTIS LIKE MYSELF VOTED FOR THIS 
LAST YEAR YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE THE 
SAME POLICIES YOU CAN'T ABDICATE 
POLICIES AFTERWARDS LISTEN TO WHAT 
SPEECH IS SAID TONIGHT LET'S MAKE 
SURE WE CAN GET SOMETHING THAT 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST OUT DON'T LOSE 
OUT 
MINISTERS MAY HAVE DONE ENOUGH OUT TODAY TO AVOID DEFEATS IN THE 
LOBBIES NEXT WEEK NOT WITH 
SUBSTANTIAL CONCESSIONS BUT A 
SUBSTANTIAL MORE CONCILIATORY 
CHANGE IN TONE FROM THE PRIME 
MINISTER SO WHO EXACTLY IS 
CURRENTLY WORSE OFF AND WHAT ARE 
THE POSSIBLE OPTIONS FOR COMPROMISE 
PAUL MASON IS HERE WITH THE FIGURE 
WHEN IT'S SCRAPPED THE TEN P. STARTING 
RATE FOR INCOME TAX THE 
GOVERNMENT'S PLAN WAS TO SOFTEN THE 
BLOW FOR POORER PEOPLE USING TAX 
CREDITS AND OTHER ALLOWANCES FIFTY THREE 
MILLION PEOPLE HAVE FALLEN THROUGH 
THE FAP GAP THESE ARE THE FIGURES 
FROM THE INSTITUTE OF FISCAL 
STUDIES THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT 
DISPUTES THEM THE FIRST GROUP TO 
LOSE OUT ARE TWENTY TWO SINGLE PEOPLE WITH 
NO CHILDREN WHO EARN O. BETWEEN 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR TWELVE THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR ALL 
KINDS OF PEOPLE HAVE FALLEN THROUGH 
THE NET THE REASON IS FOR THE PAST 
TEN YEARS GORDON BROWN HAS BEEN 
TRYING TO PRIORITISE CHILD POVERTY 
HIS PLAN IS TO ERADICATE IT BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY 
AND HALF BY TWO THOUSAND TEN BUT IT'S PROVING 
HARD TO DO THAT'S WHY LABOUR 
THROUGH A THREW A LOT OF MONEY AT 
IT MUCH OF THE MONEY FOR CHILDREN 
KICKS IN NEXT YEAR MEANWHILE UNDER 
PRESSURE THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID WE 
HAVE GOT THIS REVIEW OF CHILD 
POVERTY WE'RE GOING TO ADD ADULT 
POVERTY TO THAT REVIEW BUT WHAT 
CAN ALISTAIR DARLING DO WE HAVE 
LOOK AT TWO SOLUTIONS HE COULD 
RAISE PERSONAL ALLOWANCES THIS IS 
THE AMOUNT YOU'RE ALLOWED TO EARN 
BEFORE YOU PAY ANY TAX THE CURRENT 
ALLOWANCE IS UNDER FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED RAISE IT 
BY THREE HUNDRED AND YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEM 
FOR THIRTY THREE MILLION PEOPLE IT COSTS 
TWO POINT FIVE BILLION IT WILL ALSO GIVE 
MONEY TO EVERYBODY WHO PAYS TAX AND 
WOULD NOT LOOK FAIR FRANK FIELD 
HAS PROPOSED ANOTHER SOLUTION 
RAISING TAX CREDITS TAX CREDITS 
DON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM FOR THE TWO 
BIG ELECTORAL SENSE TIFR GROUPS 
THE TWENTY TWO MILLION SINGLE PEOPLE DON'T 
QUALIFY FOR WORKING TAX CREDIT AT 
ALL AND THE COUPLES WHO DO THEY 
LOSE OUT TWICE FROM THE TAX RISE 
BUT GAIN ONLY ONCE FROM ANY TAX 
CREDIT HERE'S THE PROBLEM FOR 
GORDON BROWN THE TEN P. TAX MOVE WAS 
BROAD BRUSHED CHEAP TO IMPLEMENT 
AND RAISED A LOT OF MONEY TAX 
CREDITS HAVE BEEN HAVE TO BE 
TARGETED ONLY ONE IN FIVE ELIGIBLE 
ACTUALLY CLAIMS THEM L. ASKED 
ALISTAIR DARLING'S SPOKESWOMAN 
GIVE ME GUIDANCE WHAT KIND OF 
GUIDANCE ARE YOU LOOKING AT AND 
THEY SAID WE CAN'T WE ARE NOT AT 
THAT STAGE YOU COULDN'T FIND 
TREASURY MINISTERS FOR DUST TOPBL 
WE'RE JOINED BY CLIVE BETTS WHO 
WROTE TO THE PRIME MINISTER LAST 
WEEK ABOUT HIS CONCERNS OVER THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. TAX BAND YOU 
WERE AT THE MEETING TONIGHT DID 
GORDON BROWN PERSUADE YOU 
I I 
THINK HE PERSUADE THE ME THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION AND THEY ARE LISTENING 
THERE'S NO RECOGNITION THERE'S A 
REAL PROBLEM AND THERE'S UNANIMITY 
THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO ADDRESS 
IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THE TWO 
ASPECTS THAT REMAIN TO BE RESOLVED 
IS HOW WE'LL RESOLVE IT YOUR 
RESUME IS A GOOD ONE YOU CAN'T GO 
FOR TOO BROAD DRUSHED BRUSHED A 
PROVE BUT TARGETING IS DIFFER AND 
TO DO QUICKLY A TIMETABLE WHICH 
INDICATES HOW QUICKLY THEY CAN 
BRING IT IT'S NOT MERELY LABOUR 
M. P.'S WHO HAVE FOR PERSUADE THERE'S 
A LOT OF VOTERS OUT THERE UNHAEN 
AND ARE LOOKING AT THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS AS A WAY OF REVENGE AS AS IT STANDS NOW WILL YOU VOTE WITH 
IT NEXT WEEK 
I WANT TO VOTE WITH IT 
I RESPECT THE GOVERNMENT'S 
CONSIDERABLE ACHIEVEMENTS IN 
DEALING WITH POVERTY IN THIS 
BUDGET WE'RE HELPING PENSIONERS 
WE'RE HELPING FAMILIES WITH 
CHILDREN WE'RE TAKING CHILDREN OUT 
OF POVERTY WHICH IS A CENTRAL 
OBJECTIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND 
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
IF YOU'LL 
VOTE FOR IT WITH NO FURTHER 
ASSURANCES IT WAS AN EMPTY 
REBELLION 
YOU DESCRIBED ME AS A REBELLION LEADING REBEL THAT DESCRIPTION IS 
A BIT UNFAIR L. WAS A LABOUR M. P. 
VERY CONCERNED FOR MY CONSTITUENTS 
GETTING EXTRA TAX I'M STILL 
CONCERNED THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY 
THAT EXTRA TAX FOR A PERIOD OF TIME 
I WANT TO SAY TO MY CONSTITUENTS 
I'M VOTING WITH THE GOVERNMENT 
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS AN IDEA 
ON HOW IT WILL CORRECT THE PROBLEM 
TO MAKE SURE YOU'LL NOT CARRY ON 
PAYING FOR TOO LONG A PERIOD OF 
TIME AND WE HAVE A TIME PLAN IN 
WHICH TO TAKE ACTION 
THERE'S NO 
URGENCY ABOUT THIS THIS HAS BEEN 
MONTHS AND MONTHS WAITING TO BE 
IMPLEMENTED AND IT WILL BE MONTHS 
AND MONTHS BEFORE YOU GET ANY END 
TO THE CONSULTATION PROCESS AND 
SOME PERIOD AFTER THAT BEFORE ANY 
ACTION CAN BE TAKEN WE HAVE HEARD 
LABOUR M. P.'S SAYING PEOPLE NEED 
ACTION NOW IF THEY ARE IN DIRE 
STRAITS 
IF WE CAN PULL A SWITCH STRAITS AND BRING THOSE CHANGES IN 
IMMEDIATELY OF COURSE WE WOULD 
EVERYONE KNOWS AND I'M SURE PEOPLE 
WATCHING TONIGHT AND YOU KNOW THAT 
TAX CHANGES ARE COMPLICATED YOU 
CAN'T ENACT THEM OVERNIGHT YOU CAN 
GIVE A CLEAR ASSURANCE YOU'LL BRING 
IN CHANGES TO COMPENSATE THE PEOPLE 
WHO LOST OUT ON TAX INCREASES AND 
WE WILL DO IT AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE AND LAY DOWN A RIGOROUS 
TIMETABLE AND AN INDICATION OF HOW 
WE WILL DO IT L. THINK THAT WILL 
HAPPEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL RESPOND 
THE MOOD HAD CHANGED THERE WAS 
GENERAL AGREEMENT IN THE PARTY 
THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NOT 
HAVE HAPPENED 
THE WHOLE THING'S FIZZLING OUT 
WELL A LOT OF VIEWERS ARE SAYING MY 
TAX HAS GONE UP WE ARE AWARE OF 
THE CONCERN THAT'S YOU HAVE WE ARE 
AWARE OF THE PAIN THAT WE'VE CAUSED 
YOU WE APOLOGISE FOR THAT AS A 
LEB M. P. I'LL APOLOGISE AND SAY WE'RE 
GOING TO PUT IT RIGHT AS QUICK AS 
POSSIBLE BUT RECOGNISE THE GREAT 
ACHIEVEMENTS BY THIS LABOUR 
GOVERNMENT THINGS LIKE THE MINIMUM 
WAGE HAVE HELPED THESE FAMILIES WE 
WILL CONTINUE THE POLICIES WHICH 
WERE OPPOSED BY BOTH THE OPPOSITION 
PARTIES PARTIES THANK YOU FINALLY THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND HAS DONE WHAT IT WAS BEGGED 
TO DO AND REFUSED TO DO IT'S MADE 
BILLIONS OF POUNDS AVAILABLE TO 
COMMERCIAL BANKS FIFTY BILLION TO 
START AND MORE TO COME TO TRY TO 
GET THEM TO DO WHAT THEY DON'T WANT 
TO DO BECAUSE THEY'VE LOST 
CONFIDENCE IN ONE ANOTHER MOST 
PEOPLE SAY THEY'RE PLEASED 
EVERYONE HOPES IT'S IT WORKS 
LET ME ASSERT MY FIRM BELIEF THAT THE ONLY THING WE HAVE 
TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF 
DRAMATIC WORDS FROM PRESIDENT 
ROOSEVELT IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE THE SITUATION IN 
THE U. S. THEN MAY HAVE BEEN RATHER 
DIFFERENT FROM THE U. K. TODAY FOR 
EXAMPLE IN THE PREVIOUS THREE 
YEARS THE U. S. HAD LOST ONE THIRD OF 
ITS G. D. P. BUT PARALLELS NONE THE 
LEGAL ARE BEING DRAWN THE PRESENT 
CRISIS HAS BEEN CALLED THE LARGEST 
FDGE SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM SINCE THE 
GREAT DEPRESSION OF THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
THAT'S BY NO LESSER BODY THAN THE 
I. M. F. WHAT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND THE NINETEEN THIRTIES DO 
HAVE IN COMMON IS A REAL FEAR IN 
FINANCIAL CIRCLES THAT FEAR IS NOW 
BEGIN TO LIFT THE BANKS WHO FOR 
MONTHS NOW HAVE BEEN UNWILLING TO 
LEND TO ONE ANOTHER AS THEY WERE 
WORRIED ABOUT THE ABILITY OF FELLOW 
BANKS TO REPAY HAVE BEEN IMMORING 
THE GOVERNMENT FOR HELP TODAY 
IMMORING THE GOVERNMENT TO HELP 
TODAY THE AUTHORITIES FINALLY MOVED 
I. N. A WAY TO SHORE UP CONFIDENCE 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND BELIEVES THESE 
MEASURES WILL SUPPORT THE BANKING 
SECTOR DURING THE UNCERTAINTY AND 
RESTORE THE STABILITY OF THE 
FINANCIAL MARKETS NEED NOW AND BOTH 
NOW AND IN 
THE LONGER TERM WHAT WHAT THE BANK IS SAYING IS THAT IT'S 
WILLING TO PUT UP ITS CAST IRON 
TREASURY BILLS OR GOVERNMENT GILTS 
AND SWAP THOSE FOR THE MORE DODGY 
MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITY BUT IT'S 
NOT BEING DONE ON A ONE TO ONE 
BASIS F. I'M A COMMERCIAL BANK AND I 
HAVE SAY ONE HUNDRED WORTH OF MORTGAGE 
BACKED SECURITIES TO DOT SWAP THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND IS GOING TO TAKE 
FROM ME EITHER TWENTY OR TEN EXTRA 
LEAVING ME WITH ONLY BETWEEN SEVENTY 
NINETY FOR MY ONE HUNDRED I'LL NEVER GET THE 
FULL ONE HUNDRED THIS DISCOUNT OR HAIR 
CUT AS THE CITY CALLS OF OF TEN PER CENT MINUS THIRTY PER CENT 
IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE MONEY 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS PUTTING IN 
MONEY WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THE TAX 
PAYERS HOW WELL IS IT REALLY 
SHIELDED FROM RISK 
IN PRINCIPLE 
THE TAX PAYER IS AT RISK IN 
PRACTICE THEY WON'T BE THE BANK KZ 
ONLY BRING THE VERY BEST QUALITY 
MORTGAGES TO THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
SECONDLY THERE IS THE HAIR CUT 
APPLIED TO THE VALUE OF THOSE 
SECURITIES THIRD IF THEY FALL IN 
VALUE THE BANK IS OBLIGED TO SWAP 
THEM FOR MORTGAGES THAT HAVE NOT 
FALLEN IN VALUE FOURTH THE BANK 
ITSELF IN TOTAL HAS TO GO BUST 
BEFORE THE TAX PAYER IS EXPOSED 
THEN THE LOSSES ON THE SECURITIES 
HAVE TO BE GREATER THAN THE HAIR 
CUT THAT'S APPLIED AS TAX PAYERS 
WE'RE PRETTY WELL PROTECTED 
IF THE 
TAX PAYER IS PROTECTED HAS THIS 
MOVE BIT BANK OF ENGLAND SERVED TO 
REMOVE ALL FEAR THE CONSEQUENCES 
FOR THE BANKERS THEY TOOK RISKS 
SHOULDN'T THEY FACE THE MUSIC AND 
GIVEN THE AUTHORITIES STEPPED IN 
THIS TIME WHY SHOULD THE BANKERS BE 
MORE CAREFUL IN FUTURE 
WE'VE ALL 
LEARNED FROM THE EXPERIENCES IN THE 
PAST EIGHT MONTHS WE WILL HAVE 
MORE FOCUS ON THE LIQUIDITY 
MANAGEMENT MORE FOCUS ON CENTRAL 
BANKS ON HOW THEY CAN MINIMISE THE 
RISKS TO FINANCIAL STABILITY THIS 
SPECIAL LIQUIDITY SCHEME FROM THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND IS A GREAT WAY OF 
ENSURING THAT HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE 
YOU ACCEPT THAT THERE HAS TO BE 
MORE REGULATION 
WE REALISE THAT'S 
COMING OUR WAY YES 
SOBER BANKERS 
MAY BE RESIGNED TO BETTER BEHAVIOUR 
BUT MORE BROADLY WILL THIS 
INJECTION WORK 
I THINK THIS IS 
GOING TO WORK IT REALLY IS A 
JUDGMENT CALL ON WHETHER YOU 
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A 
SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH MOVE TO RESTORE 
CONFIDENCE IN THE BANKING SYSTEM OF 
EACH BANK TO EACH OTHER BANK L. 
THINK THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF 
MOVE THAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND NEEDS 
TO MAKE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT 
YES I THINK IT WILL WORK 
IT SEEMS 
THAT THE LIQUIDITY PER SE IS NOT SO 
MUCH THE ISSUE FOR THE BANKS IT'S 
THE CONFIDENCE IT ENJEN DERZ IS 
PUTTING A SPRING IN THE BANKERS 
STEP ENOUGH TO CORRECT THE 
MALFUNCTIONS IN THE FINANCIAL 
SYSTEM 
IT BRINGS US CLOSER BUT IT SYSTEM BY NO MEANS BRINGS US TO THE END 
WE MUST REMEMBER FOR A BANK THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH IS OVER WHEN THEY CAN 
FUND THEIR BUSINESS AND THEY HAVE 
PLENTY OF CASH THIS MEASURE SHOULD 
GREATER HELP THAT BUT THAT DOESN'T 
MEAN THE CREDIT CRUNCH IS OVER FOR 
CONSUMERS FOR SMALL COMPANIES AND 
BORROWERS IN THE ECONOMY ONE OF 
THE WAYS IN CHT BANKS WILL START 
LENDING TO EACH OTHER AGAIN IS THAT 
IF ASSETS ARE MORE PROFITABLE I. E. 
BORROWERS WILL PAY MORE FOR THEIR 
DEBT SOLVING THE BANKS PROBLEMS 
MAY TRANSFER THEM TO THE BROAD ERE 
CONMY 
SO FIFTY BILLION OF GUARANTEES CONMY THE PRICE OF PREVENTING FINANCIAL 
DRAMA TURN NOTHING A HUMAN CRISIS 
THERE'LL BE NO RETURN TO THE GREAT 
DEPRESSION BUT NOR WILL THERE BE 
ANY IMMEDIATE RESPITE FOR THE 
HOMEOWNER HOMEOWNER NOW IT MIGHT NOT BE PEACE IN OUR 
TIME HOW OFTEN IS IT BUT IT 
LOOKED TODAY AS IF THERE HAD BEEN A 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST ACCORDING TO THE FORMER 
AMERICAN PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER 
HAMAS THE PALESTINIAN ORGANISATION 
WHICH DOMINATES THE OVERCROWDED AND 
BLOCKADED GAZA STRIP IS WILLING TO 
ACCEPT A PALESTINIAN STATE WHICH 
WOULD CO EXIST WITH ISRAEL OR AT 
LEAST WITH ISRAEL AS IT ONCE 
DEFINED ITSELF 
PEACE COMES DRIPPING SLOW IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST SINCE THIS MOMENT 
ALMOST THIRTY YEARS AGO THERE HAVE 
BEEN AS MANY SET BACKS AS THERE HAS 
BEEN PROGRESS THIS WEEK JIMMY 
CARTER THE EIGHTY THREE YEAR OLD NOBEL PEACE 
PRIZE WINNER WAS BACK IN THE 
REGION HIS VISIT DREW CRITICISM 
FROM ALL OVER THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE 
AND ISRAELI GOVERNMENT ATTACKED HIM 
FOR TALK TO AN ORGANISATION WHOSE 
CONSTITUTION COMMITS IT TO THE 
ERADICATION OF THE JEWISH STATE 
ISRAELI DISDAIN WAS SO STRONG THAT 
THE PRIME MINISTER EHUD OLMERT 
REFUSED TO SEE JIMMY CARTER FOR THE 
COMFORT HE SAID HE WAS GIVING TO 
TERRORISTS MR. CARTER DEFENDED HIS 
TALKS IN DAMASCUS WITH THE EXILED 
HAMAS LEADER KHALED MESHAAL HE 
SAID PEACE WOULD NEVER COME WITHOUT 
THE GROUP AT THE NEGOTIATE WAITING 
NEGOTIATING TABLE 
THEY WOULD 
ACCEPT A PALESTINIAN STATE ON A 
NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN BORDERS IF APPROVED BY 
PALESTINIANS AND THEY WOULD ACCEPT 
THE RIGHT OF ISRAEL TO LIVE AS A 
NEIGHBOUR NEXT DOOR IN PEACE MR. MR CARTER SAID HAMAS ALSO INDICATED 
THAT IF ISRAEL IS WILLING TO HAVE A 
MUTUAL CEASEFIRE IN GAZA THE GROUP 
WOULD ACCEPT IT BUT AS EVER THINGS 
MAY NOT BE AS SIMILAR PUM AS THEY 
AT FIRST APPEAR A HAMAS SPOKESMAN 
LATER PLACES CONDITIONS AROUND THE 
PLEDGES YOU CAN'T MAKE PEACE 
WITHOUT TALKING AND RIGHT NOW 
ISRAEL WON'T TALK TO HAMAS ISRAEL 
WON'T EVEN TALK TO MR. CARTER 
I SPOKE TO JIMMY CARTER EARLIER 
TODAY I STARTED BY ASKING HIM 
WHETHER HAMAS'S PLEDGE TO ACCEPT 
ISRAEL WITHIN ITS PRE NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN BORDER 
WAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN 
POSITION FOR THEM 
YES IT IS IT'S 
PROFOUND THIS MEAN THAT'S EVEN IF 
ABBAS AND OLMERT NEGOTIATE FOR THE 
FULL RECOGNITION OF ISRAEL THAT 
HAMAS WILL ACCEPT THIS PROVIDED 
THE PALESTINIANS APPROVE IN A 
REFERENDUM 
THAT'S AN IMPLICIT REFERENDUM REJECTION ISN'T IT ON ONE OF THE 
FOUNDING PRINCIPLES OF HAMAS 
THAT'S CORRECT OF COURSE THE OTHER 
THING WAS FORGO VIOLENCE AND HAMAS 
INDICATED TO US AT LEAST I'M NOT 
GUARANTEING THEIR COMMITMENT THAT 
IF ISRAEL IS WILLING TO HAVE 
MUTUAL CEASEFIRE AND RENUNCIATION 
OF VIOLENCE IN GAZA AND IN THE WEST 
BANK THEY WOULD ACCEPT IT AS 
FIRST STEP THEY WOULD EVEN ACCEPT 
LIMITING THAT TO GAZA SO I THINK 
THAT WHAT THEY HAVE SAID IF THEY 
WERE HONEST AND WE WROTE IT OUT SO 
THERE WOULDN'T BE MISTAKE IT'S 
SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT 
ARE YOU 
SURPRISED BY HOW FAR THEY WERE 
PREPARED TO MOVE 
WELL I WAS 
SURPRISED YES BECAUSE THEY'VE 
BEEN SO ADAMANT IN PUBLIC AND MANY 
PEOPLE GO BACK TO THEIR RIDGE NAL 
CHARTER WRITTEN ORIGINAL CHARLER 
WRITTEN MANY YEARS AGO WHICH THEY 
PRIVATELY LAUGH ABOUT AND SAY IT'S 
NO LONGER APPLICABLE ALL OF US 
WERE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WE WROTE 
OUT EVERY AGREEMENT THAT THEY LET 
ME PRONUPBSIATE PUBLICLY SO THEY 
APPROVED EVERY WORD OF WHAT I SAID 
THEY ARE ASKING I UNDERSTAND A 
SIMULTANEOUS PRESS CONFERENCE ON 
AL JAZEERA OR SOME OTHER MEDIUM AND 
I DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE ANY 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT I SAID AND 
WHAT THEY SAID 
YET THEY DIDN'T 
ACCEPT YOUR REQUEST OR SUGGESTION 
OF AN IMMEDIATE TEMPORARY CEASEFIRE 
THEY NO L. WANTED THEM TO HAVE 
D. THEY A UNILATERAL DECLARATION OF A TOTAL 
CEASEFIRE WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD 
BRING GOOD CREDIT TO THEM AND BE A 
MAJOR STEP FORWARD THEY SAID THEY 
WOULD ONLY HAVE A CEASEFIRE IF 
ISRAEL AGREED IN ADVANCE TO 
RECIPROCATE OF COURSE I HAVE NO 
COMMUNICATION WITH THE ISRAELI 
GOVERNMENT THEY WON'T SEE ME SO 
THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO 
CONCLUDE 
HOW DO YOU MOVE THIS ON CONCLUDE NOW 
I THINK TWO OR THREE WAYS NOW FIRST OF ALL THE SYRIAN 
DEVELOPMENT WAS QUITE SIGNIFICANT 
PRESIDENT ASSAD IS EAGER TO 
INITIATE PEACE TALKS WITHOUT ANY 
PRECONDITIONS WITH ISRAEL WITH THE 
UNITED STATES HELPING HIM THAT'S A 
MAJOR STEP FORWARD L. THINK HAMAS 
WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT APE PEACE 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PALESTINIANS 
AND ISRAEL IS A MAJOR STEP FORWARD 
AND THEY OFFERED TO HAVE RECIPROCAL 
CEASEFIRE CAN BE A MAJOR STEP 
FORWARD BUT I HAVE NO ROLE TO PLAY 
AS A MEDIATOR OR SPOKESPERSON FOR 
ANY GOVERNMENT I'M JUST A PRIVATE 
CITIZEN THE NEXT STEPS WILL HAVE 
TO BE TAKEN BY THE LEADERS OF THE 
TWO GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE IN THE 
NEGOTIATING POSITION 
BUT HOW CAN 
THAT HAPPEN WHEN ISRAEL REFUSES TO 
TALK TO WHAT IT CONSIDERS A 
TERRORIST ORGANISATION AND INDEED 
TO PEOPLE WHO TALK TO PEOPLE IN 
WHAT IT CONSIDERS TO BE TERRORIST 
ORGANISATIONS I MEAN YOU DO 
BELIEVE THEY'RE A TERROR 
ORGANISATION DO YOU 
AS I SAID 
THEY ARE LAUNCHING OFF MISSILES 
INTO THE AREA IS A TERRORIST ACT 
AND CRIMINAL L. ALSO SAID THAT THE 
KILLING OF INNOCENT PALESTINIANS 
WHO ARE CIVILIANS WOMEN AND 
CHILDREN IS AN ACT OF TERRORIST L. 
THINK THAT BOTH INDISCRIMINATE ACTS 
OF VIOLENCE NEED TO BE TERMINATED 
THE P. L. O. IN PAST YEARS WHEN I WAS 
PRESIDENT WAS CLASSIFIED AS 
TERRORIST THEY LATER BECAME A 
PEACE NEGOTIATOR GOT THE NOBEL 
PEACE PRIZE YOU YOU KNOW THERE'S 
ALWAYS A CHANCE TO CHANGE THE 
CHARACTERISATION OF DISSIDENT OR 
REBEL GROUPS MY HOPE IS THAT THIS 
BRIEF ENCOUNTER WITH THEM WILL LEAD 
TO THAT CONCLUSION 
ON THAT BASIS 
YOU MIGHT AS WELL TALK TO AL QAEDA 
THAT'S YOUR OPINION NOT MINE WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE PRESSURE THAT YOU'VE 
PERSONALLY COME UNDER SENATOR 
OBAMA HAS EXPRESSED SERIOUS 
RESERVATIONS ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE 
DOING DO YOU HAVE RESERVATION 
ABOUTS HIM 
NO I THINK HE WOULD 
MAKE A GREAT PRESIDENT IN THE 
FUTURE BUT I UNDERSTAND THE 
POLITICAL PRESSURES ON ANY 
CANDIDATE IN THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA WHO'S RUNNING FOR OFFICE AS 
A MEMBER OF CONGRESS OR SENATOR OR 
GOVERNOR OR PRESIDENT THEY CAN'T 
POSSIBLY APPROVE MY DOING ANYTHING 
WITH WHICH THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL 
DISAGREES SO I DON'T CRITICISE HIM 
OR SENATOR CLINTON OR SENATOR 
MCCANE FOR THEIR INEVITABLE AND 
UNDERSTANDABLE CRITICISM OF MY 
ACTIONS 
WHO DO YOU THINK WOULD ACTIONS MAKE THE BEST CANDIDATE FOR YOUR 
PARTY 
I HAVEN'T DECIDED MY OWN PARTY ENDORSEMENT I WILL BE A 
SUPERDELEGATE I'LL BE AT THE 
CONVENTION I HAVE SAID IN THE PAST 
THAT ALL OF MY CHILDREN ALL MY 
GRAND CHILDREN ALL OF THEIR 
SPOUSES HAVE PUBLICLY ENDORSED 
SENATOR OBAMA IN MY LITTLE TOWN OF 
PLAINS GEORGIA SIX HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE PEOPLE THEY 
VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY FOR OBAMA MY 
STATE OF GEORGIA VOTED 
OVERWHELMINGLY FOR OBAMA BUT I 
PERSONALLY HAVE NOT MADE A PUBLIC 
DECLARATION 
IF THINGS AREN'T DECLARATION RESOLVED BY THE PENNSYLVANIA 
PRIMARY TOMORROW AS YOU SAID 
YOU'RE A SUPERDELEGATE IS IT 
HEALTHY THAT THE THING GOES 
EVENTUALLY TO BE DECIDED BY 
SUPERDELEGATES 
YES IN A WAY BUT SUPERDELEGATES YOU KNOW MORE THAN HALF OF 
SUPERDELEGATES HAVE ALREADY 
DECLARED THEIR SU FOR THE FOR ONE 
CANDIDATE OR ANOTHER IT WOULD BE 
VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE 
SUPERDELEGATES TO TAKE A POSITION 
AGAINST A CANDIDATE THAT HAD A 
MAJORITY OF THE POPULAR VOTE A 
MAJORITY OF THE DELEGATES AND A 
MAJORITY OF THE STATE STATES 
THIS IS THE SAME POSITION AS YOU 
KNOW THAT THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES HAS TAKEN MOST 
SUPERDELEGATES WOULD AGREE WITH 
THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO 
BE THE RESULT OF THE CONTEST IN THE 
NEXT TWELVE STATES BEGINNING WITH 
PENNSYLVANIA BUT I THINK THAT THE 
VOTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC CITIZENS ALL 
OVER THE NATION WILL BE THE 
DECIDING FACTOR 
MR. CARTER THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH FOR SPARING THE TIME 
TO TALK TO US 
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE 
WE'RE JOINED NOW BY OUR DIPLOMATIC 
EDITOR MARK URBAN WHAT'S THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACCEPTING PRE 
SIXTY SEVEN BORDERS AND RECOGNISING ISRAEL 
THEN 
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CASES THEN WHERE THE LANGUAGE IS ABSOLUTELY 
CRUCIAL THE HAMAS MOVEMENT 
MESHAAL'S OFFICE PUT OUT A 
STATEMENT AFTER PRESIDENT CARTER'S 
WORDS TODAY SAYING THEY ACCEPTED A 
PALESTINIAN STATE WITHIN THE SIXTY SEVEN 
BORDERS THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM 
ACCEPTING ISRAEL ON ITS SIDE OF THE 
SIXTY SEVEN BORDERS 
TO GO ANY FURTHER WOULD LOOK LIKE 
SURRENDER IN THE FACE OF ISRAELI 
TRANSIGENCE ISRAELIS COULD ARGUE 
THAT ACCEPTING A PALESTINIAN STATE 
WITHIN THOSE BORDERS IS SIMPLY A 
TEMPORARY POSITION FOR HAMAS AS 
LONG AS THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
OBLIGATION ON THE MOVEMENT TO 
STRUGGLE FOR AN ISLAMIC PALESTINE 
ON EVERY INCH OF THE LAND REMAINS 
THEY WILL USE TACTICS LIKE THAT TO 
TRY TO CRACK THE FOREIGN OPPOSITION 
TO TALKING TO HAMAS 
IF WE SYNTHESISE ALL OF THAT IT IS 
ALL PART OF A MOVEMENT HAMAS IS 
TRYING TO DO TO GET MORE 
CONSTRUCTIVE FLOMCY AGAIN IF WE GO 
BACK TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE P. L. O. 
BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THEY FORMALLY CHANGED 
THEIR CONSTITUTION TO TAKE OUT A 
SIMILAR CLAUSE TO TAKE OUT THE 
RECOGNITION OF AN ISRAEL STATE 
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF THIS CARTER 
INITIATIVE BEARING ANY FRUIT 
HE IS 
AN ELDER STATESMAN WILL BE 
WILLING TO TAKE THE POLITICAL RISK 
AND NO AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATE WOULD TAKE THOSE RISKS 
HE COULD SERVE THE PURPOSE OF 
PUSHING THE ENVELOPE A BIT GOING 
TO SEE HAMAS IN DAMASCUS EVERYONE 
IN THE MIDDLE EAST KNOWS BECAUSE OF 
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THERE IS 
WILL BE 
NO NEW ADMINISTRATION UNTIL 
EARLY NEXT YEAR IN THAT SENSE 
REALLY HEAVY LIFTING ON THE PEACE 
AGENDA HAS TO WAIT GEORGE BUSH 
TOLD US 
HE 
WOULD SETTLE 
THE MIDDLE 
EAST BY THE TIME HE LEFT OFFICE HE HE CAME OUT WITH THIS DECLARATION THAT 
HE INTENDED TO TRY TO GET AN 
AGREEMENT BEFORE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FORMER 
PRESIDENT CARTER SAID LISTEN WE'RE 
ACTUALLY FURTHER AWAY FROM THAT 
THAN WE WERE AT THE TIME OF THE 
DECLARATION IN THAT I THINK HE'S 
RIGHT ALL 
THAT ONE 
CAN 
SAY AS 
FAR 
AS ONE

FURTHER AWAY FROM IT THERE IS A 
SERIOUS CRISIS ABOUT THE STATE OF 
GAZA AND THE HAD YOU MACHINETARIAN 
SITUATION INSIDE THERE HOWEVER 
THERE ARE STILL NEGOTIATIONS GOING 
ON BETWEEN MAHMOUD ABBAS AND THE 
ISRAELIS CONDOLEEZZA RICE LOOKS 
BACK TO PRESIDENTS BEFORE IN THE 
DEPLOMACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
HOPING IF THEY CAN MAKE SOME SORT 
OF AGREEMENT THAT ISN'T A TREATY 
OR AN AGREEMENT BUT IT COULD MOVE 
THE PEOPLE IN THE TERRITORIES 
TOWARDS OTHER POLITICAL FORCES WHO 
MIGHT THEN FORMALLY ENDORSE SUCH AN 
AGREEMENT AS A TREATY 
COMING UP ON THE PROGRAMME 
DID SUZANNE HOLDSWORTH KILL THIS 
LITTLE BOY OR HAS THERE BEEN 
MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE 
BEFORE THAT A ROUND UP OF TODAY'S 
NEWS AT A MEETING TONIGHT GORDON 
BROWN HAS TOLD LABOUR M. P.'S HE

NEWSNIGHT HE WAS MORE REASSURED 
AFTER LISTENING TO THE PRIME 
MINISTER 
THEY ARE LISTENING NOW MINISTER THERE 
WAS A 
RELUCTANCE TO 
THERE 
WAS A 
PROBLEM THERE 
WAS NOW 
A RECOGNITION THAT 
THERE IS 
A REAL PROBLEM 
THERE WAS 
UNANIMITY 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO ADDRESS THIS 
ISSUE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THE 
TWO ASPECTS REMAINING TO BE 
REINVOLVED IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO 
REVOLVE IT THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES 
WE CAN'T HAVE TOO BROAD A BRUSH OF 
AN APPROACH BECAUSE YOU CAN HELP 
THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY HAD A TAX 
CUT BUT 
TARGETING AN 
APPROACH IS 
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT TO DO 
QUICKLY QUICKLY A BRITISH SOLDIER HAS BEEN IN 
SOUTHERN AFGHANISTAN 
HE WAS A 
MEMBER OF THE QUEEN'S ROYAL LANCERS 
AND HAD BEEN TRAVELLING IN A SUPPLY 
CONVOY WHICH CAME UNDER ATTACK HIS 
FAMILY HAS BEEN INFORMED LT TALKS 
AIMED AT DIVERT AGO TWO DAY STRIKE 
AT GRANGE MOUTH WILL TAKE PLACE 
TOMORROW TOMORROW ACAS WILL BE INVOLVED FUEL 
SHORTAGES ARE PREDICTED FROM FRIDAY 
IF THE STRIKE GOES AHEAD 
THE TRIAL OF TWO MEN ACCUSED OF 
TRYING TO BLACKMAIL MEMBER OF THE 
ROYAL FAMILY HAS CONTINUED IN 
CLOSED SESSION TO ALLOW THE JURY 
TO HEAR RECORDINGS SUBMITTED AS 
EVIDENCE THE IDENTITY OF THE ROYAL 
FAMILY MEMBER CAN'T BE DISCLOSED 
FOR LEGAL REASONS 
THE FOREIGN SECRETARY ED MILIBAND 
HAS AGAIN ACCUSED PRESIDENT MUGABE 
OF TRYING TO STEAL THE ECTION IN 
A STRONGLY WORDED STATEMENT WRITTEN 
TO M. P.'S HE SAID MR. MUGABE WAS 
CLINGING TO POWER BY BEATING HIS 
OWN PEOPLE TO DEATH THE RESULTS OF 
A PARTIAL RECOUNT OF ELECTIONS LAST 
MONTH HAVE STILL NOT BE ANNOUNCED 
SHE'S THE BABYSITTER ACCUSED AND 
CONVICTED OF MURDERING HER 
NEIGHBOUR'S TWO YEAR OLD SON BY 
BANGING HIS HEAD AGAINST A WOODEN 
BANNISTER YOU MAY RECALL HOW IN 
SEPTEMBER WE TOLD THE STORY OF 
SUZANNE HOLDSWORTH WHO WAS JAILED 
FOR LIFE FOR THE MURDER OF KYLE 
FISHER SHE HAS REPEATEDLY DENIED 
THE ALLEGATION AND AN APPEAL WILL 
BE HEARD TOMORROW 
TWO POLICE OFFICERS ON THE INQUIRY 
ARE RAISING FRESH DOUBTS ABOUT A 
TROUBLING CASE 
LOOK AT KYLE FISHER'S RIGHT HIGH 
THERE IS SOMETHING IMMEDIATELY AND 
OBVIOUSLY RIGHT EYE THERE IS 
SOMETHING IMMEDIATELY AND OBVIOUSLY 
WRONG THE 
SOME THE APPEAL COURT WILL HEAR 
THAT BEHIND THE EYE WAS A 
POTENTIALLY FATAL BRAIN INJURY 
THAT MATTERS BECAUSE THIS WOMAN 
SUZANNE HOLDSWORTH WAS ALLEGED TO 
HAVE SMASHED KYLE'S HEAD ON 
BANNISTER SHE SPENT THE LAST THREE 
YEARS IN PRISON FOR MURDER AND 
BECAUSE THIS WOMAN FORMER ACTING 
DETECTIVE SERGEANT SHARON BIRCH 
HAS SPENT THE LAST THREE YEARS 
WORRYING THAT THE MURDER INQUIRY 
SHE WORKED ON MAY HAVE MISSED 
EVIDENCE THAT WOULD HAVE LED TO A 
CHILD FAIR TRIAL 
THERE WERE 
THINGS FROM A CHILD PROTECTION 
ISSUE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED 
PROPERLY THAT WEREN'T BUT I 
WASN'T LISTENED TO 
QUESTIONS ARE 
BEING ASKED ABOUT THE CASE 
CLEVELAND POLICE WERE SO PROUD OF 
THEIR INQUIRY INTO THE DEATH THAT 
THEY PUBLISHED A TWO PAGE FEATURE 
OF IT IN THEIR ANNUAL REPORT 
BOASTING OF A RELENTLESS INQUIRY 
BUT WAS IT THOROUGH AND FAIR 
A MAN WHO LED IT WAS CLEAVE LAND 
SUPERCOP JOHN HUTCHINSON SEEN 
HERE LEADING THE TONY HUTCHINSON 
SEEN HERE LEADING THE INVESTIGATION 
INTO THE MISSING CANOE MAN JOHN 
DARWIN DARWIN SUZANNE HOLDSWORTH HAS ALWAYS 
DENIED HARMING CARL SHE WAS 
ALLEGED TO HAVE SLAMMED HIS HEAD 
AGAINST A BANNISTER USING THE KIND OF FORCE YOU 
WOULD SEE 
IN A SIXTY 
MILE AN 
HOUR CAR 
CRASH AFTER A 
CONVICTION A SPOKESMAN FOR THE 
FISHER FAMILY SAID WORDS CANNOT 
EXPRESS WHAT WE FEEL FOR HOLDSWORTH 
BUT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROSECUTION 
CASE WON'T GO AWAY ON THE ALLEGED 
MURDER WEAPON THE BANNISTER THERE 
WAS NO BLOOD NO D. N. A. NO HAIR NO 
SKIN AND NO DENT ON THE BANNISTER 
ITSELF AND THEN THERE IS THE 
QUESTION OF WHAT LAY BEHIND KYLE'S 
DROOPING EYE BRAIN DAMAGE 
AISLE'S EYE INJURY HAPPENED IN THE 
SPRING KYLE'S EYE INJURY HAPPENED 
IN THE SPRING OF TWO THOUSAND THREE NOTHING TO 
DO WITHHOLD HOLDSWORTH HE WAS 
BEING LOOKED AFTER BY HIS MOTHER 
THIS FACE SURGEON SAW KYLE IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
ALMOST TWO YEARS LATER WITH A 
BRAIN SURGEON COLLEAGUE 
A BONE HAD 
SOME HOW BEEN FRACTURED AND THE 
BRAIN WAS HERNIATING DOWN INTO THE 
EYE SOCKET THE REASON THE EYE HAD 
DROPPED WAS BECAUSE 
THE BRAIN 
WAS 
PUSHING DOWN ON TOP OF THE EYE THE THE JURY SAW PICTURES OF KYLE'S 
DROOPING EYE BUT THEY DIDN'T HEAR 
THAT BEHIND THE EYE WAS A DAMAGED 
BRAIN WHICH COULD HAVE TRIGGERED 
KYLE TO FIT AND DIE SHARON BIRCH 
WAS AN EXPERIENCED CHILD PROTECTION 
OFFICER WHEN SHE WORKED ON THE 
MURDER INQUIRY INTO THE SUMMER OF 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHEN SHE READ THROUGH KYLE'S 
MEDICAL NOTE SHE REALISED THE 
DOCTORS HAD SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT 
KYLE'S EYE SOCKET INJURY 
I THINK 
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED 
FURTHER TO RULE IT PROVING 
SIGNIFICANT 
WOULD YOU HAVE WANTED SIGNIFICANT A POLICE OFFICER TO GO AND TAKE A 
STATEMENT FROM EITHER OR BOTH OF 
THE DOCTORS 
I WOULD HAVE YES A A STATEMENT I WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY STATEMENT DID THE POLICE GET IN TOUCH WITH 
YOU OR YOUR COLLEAGUE THEY THEY CERTAINLY DIDN'T GET IN CONTACT 
WITH ME OF COURSE I HAVE DISCUSSED 
THIS WITH MR. MARK HE SAYS HE 
CANNOT RECALL ANYONE CONTACTING HIM 
AND CERTAINLY NEITHER OF US 
COMPLETED A STATEMENT OR ANYTHING 
LIKE THAT 
AND THE CONTEXT OF A MURDER INQUIRY 
IS THAT RIGHT 
I THINK WE SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN CONTACTED WE HAVE 
POTENTIALLY USEFUL INFORMATION AND 
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASKED TO GIVE A 
STATEMENT 
DETECTIVE BIRCH FEARED STATEMENT LINES OF INQUIRY CRITICAL TO THE 
INVESTIGATION WERE BEING 
NEGLECTED WHEN I STARTED TO 
NEGLECTED CONCERNS AND THINGS THAT I FELT 
SHOULD BE CLARIFIED BECAUSE IT IS 
NOT JUST WHAT YOU CAN PROVE BUT 
ALSO WHAT YOU CAN DISPROVE I FELT 
THAT I WAS THEY THOUGHT OF ME AS 
IRKSOME THAT MAYBE I WAS GOING 
DOWN THE WRONG TRACK FOR THEIR 
INQUIRY AND HAVING BEEN PRAISED 
FOR THE QUALITY OF MY STATEMENTS 
THERE WAS A POINT WHEN I WAS 
ADVISED THAT PERHAPS WHAT I WAS 
PUTTING IN THE STATEMENTS WASN'T 
PARTICULARLY RELEVANT TO THE LINE 
OF INQUIRY NOW I WRITE MY 
STATEMENTS WITH INTEGRITY AND WHAT 
THE WITNESS SAYS F. IT DOESN'T FIT 
THEN THAT'S DOWN TO THE WITNESS 
NOT ME 
DETECTIVE BIRCH FEARED THAT LINES 
OF INQUIRY CRITICAL TO THE 
INVESTIGATION WERE BEING NEGLECTED 
BY SOME OF CERTIFICATE SENIOR 
OFFICERS 
I WENT TO SPEAK TO A OFFICERS PREVIOUS SUPERVISOR AND I SPOKE TO 
HER ABOUT SOME CONCERNS I HAD 
MAINLY AROUND THE CHILD PROTECTION 
CONCERNS AND SOME OF THE THINGS 
THAT I FELT AS PART OF THE 
INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE RULED OUT 
SHE THEN TOOK MY CONCERNS FURTHER 
AND THE TRIAL WAS HALTED AND I WAS 
TAKEN TO COURT TO SPEAK TO VARIOUS 
BARRISTERS 
SHARON BIRCH WAS BARRISTERS QUESTIONED FOR A WHOLE DAY SHE 
ADMITS SHE MAY HAVE GOT SOME OF THE 
DETAILS WRONG 
THAT DAY 
BUT 
SAYS THAT SHE TOLD THE POLICE THE 
DEFENCE AND THE PROSECUTION IN THE 
ABSENCE OF JUDGE AND JURY THAT 
KYLE'S EYE MERITED FURTHER 
INVESTIGATION EVEN NOW AT THIS 
LATE STAGE NO ONE FROM THE POLICE 
GOT A FULL STATEMENT FROM EITHER 
PROFESSOR AVERY OR MR. MARKS SO THE 
JURY NEVER GOT TO HEAR ABOUT THE 
SIGNIFICANCE OF KYLE'S BRAIN DAMAGE 
THE TRIAL WAS RESTARTED AND SUZANNE 
HOLDSWORTH WAS CONVICTED OF MURDER 
IT WAS SUGGESTED TO ME WHEN I WENT 
TO COURT AND THE TRIAL WAS STOPPED 
THAT I CONSIDERED TAKING A MEDICAL 
RETIREMENT 
WHO SUGGESTED THAT ONE RETIREMENT ONE OF THE OFFICERS ONE OF THE SENIOR 
OFFICERS I DO HAVE A GENETIC 
CONDITION BUT I HAVE HAD IT ALL MY 
LIFE AND I DID TWENTY YEARS POLICE 
SERVICE WITH IT I HAD NO WISH TO 
LEAVE THE POLICE FORCE BUT THE WAY 
THAT I HAVE BEEN TREATED WITHIN THE 
POLICE FORCE I FELT IT MADE MY 
POSITION UNTENABLE 
NEWSNIGHT ASKED CLEVELAND POLICE TO 
RESPOND THEIR HEAD OF CRIME 
DETECTIVE SUPERINTENDENT TOLD US ON SHARON BIRCH HE SAID 
CLEVELAND POLICE SAID THAT 
DETECTIVE SUPERINTENDENT TONY 
TUCHTUCH WHO LED THE MURDER 
INQUIRY D. HUTCHINSON WHO LED THE 
INQUIRY IS TO REDUIRE AFTER 
YEARS SERVICE SUZANNE HOLDSWORTH 
MAINTAINS SHE NEVER HARMED KYLE AT 
THE TRIAL THERE WAS NO EXPERT 
WITNESSES FOR THE DEFENCE TOMORROW 
AT THE APPEAL COURT THERE WILL BE 
FIVE FIVE TOMORROW MORNING'S FRONT PAGES WE 
HAVE ONLY TWO OF THEM THE CAP 
TELEGRAPH AND THE GUARDIAN 
OUR POLITICAL EDITOR IS WITH US 
HERE NOW 
WHERE IS THIS GOING 
WELL IN TERMS 
OF THE VOTE NEXT WEEK I THINK 
GOVERNMENT MANAGERS ARE REASONABLY 
CONFIDENT TONIGHT THEY HAVE DONE 
ENOUGH OR GORDON BROWN'S DONE 
ENOUGH TO BE FRANK TO WIN THAT 
VOTE THE HARDLINE MEMBERS ARE 
STILL SAYING THEY ARE GOING TO 
REBEL BUT I THINK PEOPLE LIKE 
FRANK FIELD AND IAN GIBSON BUT A 
LOT OF THE MORE MAINSTREAM M. P.'S AND 
LESS PROMINENT ON THIS MAY HAVE 
BEEN SWAYED BY THE PRIME MINISTER'S 
WORDS I THOUGHT YVETTE COOPER GAVE 
A PRETTY POOR PERFORMANCE IN THE 
COMMONS AND IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL 
CONCESSIONS MADE THERE WASN'T HUGE AMOUNT OF SUBSTANCE TO THEM 
THE IMPORTANT 
THING IS 
IN THE 
OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S 
WHERE AS A FEW DAYS AGO AND 
CERTAINLY WHEN HE ADDRESSED THE P. L. P. 
A FEW WEEKS AGO HE WAS ARGUING 
WHETHER THERE WERE ANY LOSERS FROM 
THIS MEASURE NOW I THINK M. P.'S ARE 
REASSURED BY THE 
FACT THAT 
ACCEPTS 
THERE IS 
AND 
SOMEBODY HAS 
TO BE 
DONE ABOUT IT AND BY 
AUTUMN 
AN INTERESTING 
POLL ON THE AUTUMN FRONT PAGE OF THE GUARDIAN THIS THIS GIVES THE CONSERVATIVES THIRTY NINE PER CENT LABOUR 
THIRTY FOUR PER CENT THE LIB DEMS NINETEEN WHICH IS A 
LEAD OF ONLY FIVE PER CENT FOR THE 
CONSERVATIVES THAT IS WAY DOWN ON 
THE FIGURES IN THE TEENS THAT WE 
SAW IMMEDIATELY AFTER 
THE BUDGET 
AND IN 
LINE WITH 
A FEW OTHER POLLS 
IN THE 
LAST WEEK 
OR SO 
WHICH HAVE 
BROUGHT THE CONSERVATIVE LEAD DOWN 
I THINK IN THOSE IMMEDIATE POST 
BUDGET POLLS WHICH WERE WAY ABOVE 
WHAT THEY HAD 
BEEN IN 
JANUARY THAT 
DID CAUSE A LOT 
OF M. P.'S 
GOT THEM 
VERY ANXIOUS AND PEOPLE STARTED 
TALKING ABOUT TIPPING POINTS AND 
MELTDOWN THAT POLL AND 
THE OTHER 
POLLS 
OF THE 
LAST DAYS CONTINUE I 
THINK 
IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO ARGUE THAT 
HAS YET OCCURRED IT SUGGESTS THAT 
THE LOCAL ELECTIONS ON 
FIRST MAY 
NOT BE THE COMPLETE WAIPOUT THAT 
SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WIPOUT THAT 
SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PREDICTING 
THE MAYORAL POLL IN LONDON MAY BE 
CLOSE IF KEN LIVINGSTONE WAS TO 
PULL THAT ONE OFF THAT WOULD DO A 
LOT TO RESTORE LABOUR FORTUNES 
THAT'S ALL FROM NEWSNIGHT TONIGHT 
WE WILL BE HERE TOMORROW AS THE 
SLOW TRAIN TAKING SOMEONE INTO THE 
AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS 
DRAWS INTO PENNSYLVANIA STATION WE 
WILL BE REPORTING FROM BARACK 
OBAMA'S TOWN ON WHY HE SEEMS TO
