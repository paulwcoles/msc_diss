BEFORE WE SEE IT IN THE STUDIO LET'S FIND OUT MORE ABOUT IT 
HANDBALL TWO TEAMS OF SEVEN PLAYERS PASS BOUNCE 
AND THROW A BALL TO GET IT INTO THE NET OF THE OPPOSING TEAM 
IT'S A BIT LIKE FOOTBALL BUT PLAYED WITH YOUR HANDS 
THE TEAM WHO SCORE THE MOST GOALS WINS 
WITH THE BALL TRAVELLING AT SPEEDS OF UP TO ONE HUNDRED K. M. PER HOUR 
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO SEE FIFTY OR SIXTY GOALS SCORED IN A SIXTY MINUTE GAME 
ALTHOUGH ANYONE CAN PLAY HANDBALL 
BEING TALLER AND HAVING GOOD FITNESS AND CO ORDINATION ALL COME IN HANDY 
UNLUCKY ANDY 
IT LOOKS PRETTY PHYSICAL DOESN'T IT

GOOD FOR HANDBALL YEAH 
I'D NEVER HEARD OF HANDBALL UNTIL TODAY YOU SEEM PERFECT TO TEACH ME 
WHERE DO WE START WE'LL START WITH A FEW BASIC SKILLS 
I'M SURE YOU'LL GET A FEW GOALS BY THE END OF THE SHOW 
I'M IN THERE COME ON SHE'S DETERMINED 
THANKS WE'LL CATCH UP WITH THEM LATER 
ONE OF MY FIRST ADVENTURES ON BLUE PETER WAS MEETING 
THE ROYAL AIRFORCE AEROBATIC TEAM THE RED ARROWS 
IT WAS A LIFETIME AMBITION THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED 
I CAUGHT UP WITH THE REDS ON THE MEDITERRANEAN ISLAND OF CYPRUS 
WHERE EVERY SPRING THEY POLISH THEIR DISPLAY ROUTINE 
PERFECT FLYING WEATHER ALMOST EVERY DAY 
THIS IS JUST SUPERB 
THE NOISE IS INCREDIBLE 
THE SMELL OF THE EXHAUST IT'S SO GRACEFUL SO STREAMLINED 
I LOVE FLYING AND I LOVE AIRCRAFT 
THIS IS JUST THE BEST 
SPEED OF SOUND BY COLDPLAY 
THE REDS WERE FOUNDED ON FIRST MARCH NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE WITH GNAT AIRCRAFT 
THE RED ARROWS 
THEIR BRIEF SET UP AN AEROBATIC TEAM FLYING GNAT TRAINERS 
WHICH WILL STEAL THE SHOW AT AIR DISPLAYS ALL OVER EUROPE 
SINCE THEN THEY HAVE DELIGHTED CROWDS ALL OVER THE WORLD 
WITH OVER THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DISPLAYS 
TODAY THEY FLY THE B. A. E. SYSTEMS HAWK 
AND THEIR TEAM LEADER IS SQUADRON LEADER DICKY PATOUNAS' 
HOW WAS IT 
IT WAS O. K. THANK YOU 
IT WASN'T UP TO STANDARD BUT IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
IS IT A GOOD TEAM THIS YEAR 
ALWAYS WE MAKE SURE WE SELECT THE RIGHT PEOPLE 
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE FLYING SO CLOSE TOGETHER 
IS THERE ANY HAIRY MOMENTS 
I WOULDN'T SAY HAIRY MOMENTS 
EVERYONE IS ALWAYS CONCENTRATING AS MUCH AS THEY CAN 
IN TIME AND WITH PRACTICE YOU SMOOTH DOWN 
AND YOU GET USED TO THE FACT THAT THE GUY NEXT TO YOU 
IS MOVING A BIT BUT IS NOT GONNA MOVE TOO MUCH 
YOU LEARN TO TRUST THEM MORE AND FLY YOURSELF MORE SMOOTHLY 
DOWN TWO 
THIS DEBRIEFING IS SO INTERESTING 
ALL THE REDS MUCK IN WITH THEIR COMMENTS ABOUT HOW THE DISPLAY WENT 
THEY ALL HAVE A CHAT THEY RESPECT DICKY THE BOSS THEY CALL HIM 
THEY TRY AND PUT IT RIGHT FOR THE NEXT DISPLAY 
FIVE OF THE NINE ARE ORIGINAL THEY'RE TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD 
THIS ONE NUMBER THREE IS A TEST JET 
INSIDE IT'S COVERED WITH DEVICES THAT MEASURE WEAR AND TEAR 
IT'S BEST TO SPOT THE PROBLEM BEFORE IT HAPPENS 
THERE ARE SIXTY SIX IN THE GROUND CREW 
I JOINED TECHNICIAN BARRY PRITCHARD FOR A REGULAR INSPECTION 
ANY OF THE PANELS MIGHT HAVE COME UNDONE THROUGH VIBRATION 
CHECK THE THREE AERIALS UNDERNEATH THE FRONT ARE STILL SECURE 
THE LANDING LIGHT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE CHECKS 
WE CHECK FOR CRACKS AND DENTS YOU DON'T WANT THAT BREAKING 
BECAUSE FRAGMENTS COULD GO STRAIGHT DOWN THE ENGINE O. K. 
FOLLOWING ROUND THE SIDE 
I NEVER IMAGINED THERE WOULD BE SO MUCH TO DO 
A IS THIRTY FOUR 
YEAH B. ONE HUNDRED FOUR 
ONE HUNDRED FOUR WHAT EXACTLY ARE THESE MEASUREMENTS 
ALL THE G. FORCES THAT ARE BEING PUT ONTO THE AIRCRAFT THROUGHOUT FLIGHT 
C. IS ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FOURTEEN 
D. NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
THAT'S HOW MANY TIMES THIS AIRCRAFT HAS PULLED TWENTY FIVE G. NO WAY 
IF YOU WONDERED WHERE THE COLOURED SMOKE COMES FROM 
UNDER THE JET IS A TANK OF DIESEL LYNCH IS ADDING DYE INTO THE TANK 
ALL THE PILOT HAS TO DO TO GET THE COLOURED SMOKE TO COME OUT 
IS PUSH A BUTTON THEN THE DYE COMES ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK 
AND COMES OUT THROUGH THESE PIPES RED WHITE AND BLUE 
SO WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF ME TAKING PART IN A PRACTICE DISPLAY 
YOU HAVE EVERY CHANCE 
WE'LL GO FOR A FLIGHT A SHAKE DOWN SORT AS WE CALL IT O. K. 
YOU'LL PULL ALL SORTS OF G. AND DO LOOPS AND ROLLS 
WHEN YOU PROVE YOU'VE GOT AN IRON STOMACH 
WE'LL GO FLYING AFTERWARDS IN A DISPLAY 
I TAKE TO THE SKIES 
WITH THE RED ARROWS 
BUT WILL I BE ABLE TO STOMACH IT 
IMAGINE SIX OF YOUR FRIENDS PRESSING DOWN ON YOUR HEAD 
AS HARD AS POSSIBLE THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF SIX G. 
WE'LL SEE IF MY STOMACH CAN COPE WITH THAT PRESSURE LATER 
BUT FIRST ANDY HOW'S IT GOING 
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET ON THE COURT 
I'VE NEVER PLAYED BEFORE WHAT MOVE CAN I START WITH 
THE FIRST SKILL I'LL TEACH YOU IS A JUMP SHOT 
YOU SEE THIS AREA HERE ONLY THE GOALKEEPER'S ALLOWED IN IT 
SO TO GET CLOSER TO THE GOAL 
THE WAY IS TO JUMP IN AND THROW THE BALL BEFORE YOU LAND 
WE'RE ALLOWED THREE STEPS 
YOU'LL HAVE TO DO IT OPPOSITE TO ME BECAUSE I'M LEFT HANDED 
YOU GO LEFT RIGHT JUMP OFF YOUR LEFT 
IN THE AIR ARM NICE AND HIGH LOOKING AT THE GOALKEEPER 
JUST SLOT IT IN SHOW ME HOW IT'S DONE O. K. 
NICE ONE I WANT TO HAVE A GO 
GO ON THEN O. K. SO IT'S 
LEFT RIGHT LEFT JUMP 
IS THAT ALL RIGHT ANYTHING I COULD HAVE DONE BETTER 
GET YOUR ARM A BIT HIGHER AND THAT'S PERFECT QUALITY 
WHERE'S ZOE GONE THERE SHE IS OVER HERE 
I'M FAKING IT WITH ANISH WHICH IS TALK US THROUGH IT 
FAKING IS TO GET PAST A PLAYER SO YOU HAVE AN OPEN SPACE TO SHOOT 
TO DO THAT YOU NEED TO MAKE THE SPACE TO SHOOT 
YOU NEED TO FAKE THE PLAYER TO THE LEFT IF YOU'RE RIGHT HANDED 
GO TO THE LEFT AND THE PLAYER WILL COME WITH YOU 
THEN STEP TO THE RIGHT AND YOU HAVE THE SPACE TO SHOOT 
TAKE A QUICK STEP AND TAKE YOUR SHOT 
I'LL JUST DEMONSTRATE 
PASS TO ME THEN 
AH LIKE THAT IT'S QUICK 
DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO IT THAT QUICKLY BUT I'LL TRY THE TECHNIQUE 
YAY WOO 
O. K. YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY LOVING HANDBALL HOW DID YOU FIRST GET INTO IT 
SOME FRIENDS WENT TO THE LEYTON ORIENT SPORTS COMMUNITY PROGRAMME 
THERE YOU ARE IN TRAINING 
THE COACH THERE MIRIAM PUPALOVA IS REALLY GOOD 
SHE MADE HANDBALL FUN WHEN WE PLAY IT 
WE GET SUCH AN ADRENALIN RUSH IT'S SO QUICK 
WE LOVE IT SO WE KEEP PLAYING 
I CAN SEE IT'S INCREDIBLE FUN WE CAN'T STOP 
AND YOU'D LOVE TO BE PART OF THE OLYMPIC TEAM YEAH 
IT WOULD BE A DREAM WE'RE TRAINING TO GET TO THAT SQUAD 
TO BE IN THE OLYMPICS BEST OF WISHES AND LUCK FOR THAT 
ANDY COME ON ANDY AND I STILL NEED TO GET MORE PRACTICE IN 
WHILST WE DO THAT GETHIN IS WITH OUR NEXT WEIRD ANIMAL FOR OUR A Z. 
U. IS FOR UPSIDE DOWN JELLYFISH 
PLEASE DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SET 
THIS CRAZY CREATURE CAN BE FOUND 
IN THE WARM WATERS OF THE CARIBBEAN 
THE FLORIDA KEYS THE GULF OF MEXICO 
AND THE PACIFIC 
AND TO TELL US MORE ABOUT THIS STRANGE CREATURE 
IS OUR RESIDENT WEIRD ANIMAL EXPERT NICK BAKER 
ONLY YOU COULD SAY THAT AND GET AWAY WITH IT 
TELL ME MORE ABOUT THESE THINGS THEY LOOK A BIT LIKE A CAULIFLOWER 
I GUESS THEY DO A BIT 
JELLYFISH ARE A WEIRD BUNCH ANYWAY 
A REGULAR JELLYFISH IS PRETTY ODD 
THE WEIRDEST OF THE WEIRDOS ARE THESE 
THE FIRST AND MOST OBVIOUS THING ABOUT THEM 
IS THEY LOOK LIKE CAULIFLOWERS THEY'RE UPSIDE DOWN 
IT'S A BAD THING USUALLY WITH WILD ANIMALS 
IF THEY'RE UPSIDE DOWN THINGS AREN'T GOING WELL 
WITH THESE IT'S PART OF THE DESIGN 
THEY LIVE IN CLEAR WARM SHALLOW SEAS 
WHEN THAT'S THE CASE LIGHT CAN PENETRATE THROUGH THE WATER 
THESE HAVE LITTLE TINY PLANTS ALGAE IN THEIR BODY TISSUES 
USUALLY IN THE TENTACLES UNDERNEATH WHICH IS WHY THEY'RE GREENY BLUE 
THEY TURN UPSIDE DOWN TO PRESENT THOSE ALGAE TO THE SUNLIGHT 
YOU COULD MISTAKE THEM FOR A PLANT WHEN THEY'RE NOT MOVING I GUESS SO 
THEY GIVE THE GAME AWAY BY EVERY NOW AND AGAIN PULSATING 
AND WAFTING WATER OVER THEIR STINGERS 
WHAT ELSE IS WEIRD ABOUT THEM 
THERE'S NOTHING WEIRD ABOUT HAVING ONE MOUTH 
BUT IMAGINE HAVING FORTY OF THEM 
THESE GUYS HAVE LOTS OF TINY PORES ON THEIR FEEDING TENTACLES 
WHICH WHEN THEIR ALGAE DON'T PRODUCE ENOUGH FOOD FOR THEM 
THEY CAN SUBSIDISE THAT BY CATCHING TINY MICROSCOPIC ANIMALS 
WITH THEIR STINGING CELLS AND BREAK THEM UP AND ABSORB THEM 
INTO THEIR FORTY MOUTHS CLEVER WHICH IS PRETTY STRANGE 
THEY'RE WELL CAMOUFLAGED AREN'T THEY THEY ARE 
THEY GIVE THEMSELVES AWAY WITH THIS PULSATING BUT DO LOOK PLANT LIKE 
BUT THOSE STINGING CELLS CAN GIVE PROTECTION TO OTHER CREATURES 
THAT CAN GET UNDERNEATH THEM SOME CRABS USE THEM AS HIDE OUTS 
LIKE POISONOUS UMBRELLAS LIKE A COAT EXACTLY 
IS IT TRUE THAT IF YOU GET STUNG PEEING ON IT MAKES IT BETTER 
HOW DID I KNOW YOU'D ASK ME THAT TO BE HONEST I DO NOT REALLY KNOW 
I'VE NEVER TRIED IT 
HOWEVER I'M LEAD TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S A CLASSIC URBAN MYTH 
I PROMISE I WON'T DO IT THANKS AND YOU CAN SEE THESE CREATURES 
AT GREAT YARMOUTH'S SEA LIFE CENTRE 
AND THE GREAT THING IS BADGE HOLDERS GET IN FREE 
LET'S SEE WHERE IT'S GONNA GO ON WEIRD WALL 
THERE'S NOT MANY SPACES LEFT 
MAYBE UP HERE YEAH 
IT'S NOT REALLY THAT'LL DO 
LET'S GO AND SEE HOW OUR HANDBALL EXPERTS ARE DOING 
THAT'S A GREAT SHOT DID YOU SEE THAT 
IT'S GOING WELL I'M REALLY LOVING THIS 
ZOE ARE WE ENJOYING IT YEAH BUT I WANNA BE ON ANDY'S TEAM 
NO YOU'RE AGAINST HIM THERE'S A PENALTY SHOOT OUT LATER FIRST

SHOW ME HOW IT'S DONE 
WELL BECAUSE YOUR ARM'S HIGH UP YOU USUALLY THROW LIKE THAT 
DEFENDERS USUALLY HAVE THEIR ARMS UP TO BLOCK IT 
A WAY TO GET AROUND THIS IS TO SHOOT AROUND THEM O. K. 
IT'S A HIP SHOT O. K. I'LL BE A DEFENDER 
YOU RUN UP FAKE THE SHOT 
OH THAT'S QUICK 
IS THIS A NORMAL SIZED COURT THAT YOU'D PLAY ON 
NO A NORMAL COURT IS TWENTY M. WIDE AND FORTY M. LONG 
QUITE A LOT BIGGER THAN THIS ONE 
ZOE YOU BE MY DEFENDER AND I'LL DO A HIP SHOT 
READY ONE TWO THREE 
O. I. IS SHE ALLOWED TO DO THAT REFEREE

THAT'S NOT A BAD SHOT 
THAT'S INTERESTING WHO'S GOT THE EDGE AT THE MOMENT 
I'M NOT SURE WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE PENALTY SHOOT OUT 
I LOVE IT 
NOW LET'S SEE IF I REALISE MY DREAM OF FLYING WITH THE RED ARROWS

PENALTY SHOOT OUT HOW IS IT GONNA WORK 
WHEN TWO TEAMS ARE DRAWING AT THE END OF A GAME
