NO U. TURN THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT 
WILL NOT BACK DOWN OVER SCRAPPING 
THE TEN P. TAX RATE LABOUR REBELS 
VOW TO FIGHT ON SAYING GORDON BROWN 
IS IN DENIAL 
JOHN PRESCOTT REVEALS A TEN YEAR 
BATTLE WITH THE EATING DISORDER 
BULIMIA BULIMIA I NEVER ADMITTED TO THIS OUT OF THE 
SHAME AND EMBARRASSMENT I FOUND IT 
DIFFICULT AS A MAN LIKE ME TO ADMIT 
THAT I SUFFERED FROM BULIMIA 
WILLIAM UNDER FIRE SHOULD A 
HELICOPTER TRAINING FLIGHT HAVE 
INCLUDED A STOP AT THE MIDDLETONS' 
HOME HOME AND ALL THE WINNERS AND LOSERS T. V. 
TRIUMPHS AND TEARS FROM THE BAFTAS 
GOOD EVENING THE GOVERNMENT'S 
AGAIN DEFENDED ITS DECISION TO 
SCRAP THE TEN P. RATE OF INCOME TAX 
WITH THE CHANCELLOR INSISTING TODAY 
THAT THERE'LL BE NO U. TURN 
ALISTAIR DARLING HAS HOWEVER HINTED 
THAT THERE MAY BE MEASURES TO COME 
THAT WOULD SOFTEN THE BLOW THE ROW 
LOOKS SET TO CONTINUE THIS WEEK 
WITH M. P.'S RETURNING TO WORK FROM 
THEIR EASTER BREAK HERE'S JAMES 
HARDY HARDY IT WAS HIS LAST ACT AS CHANCELLOR 
BUT IT'S FROM BEHIND THE DOOR OF 
NUMBER TEN THAT GORDON BROWN IS 
COUNTING THE COST OF HIS DECISION 
TO SCRAP THE TEN P. TAX RATE NOW IT'S 
HIS SUCCESSOR WHO IS PICKING UP THE 
PIECES ON THE B. B. C. TODAY AN 
UNPALATABLE MESSAGE TO GRAMBLING 
LABOUR M. P.'S YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE IT 
BUT THERE ARE NO QUICK FIXES I I INTEND AS I SAY IN FUTURE BUDGETS 
TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE WHAT I CAN'T 
DO IS TO REWRITE THE BUDGET THE 
FINANCIAL YEAR HAS ALREADY BEGUN 
THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO 
ARE ALREADY GOING TO BE PAYING TAX 
AT TWENTY P. RATHER THAN AT TWENTY TWO P. THE THE RINGLEADER OF LABOUR'S REBELS 
ACCUSE MR. BROWN OF BEING THIS 
DENIAL 
THIS IS A CORE BELIEF FOR DENIAL US AND MY GUESS IS ONCE WE'RE BACK 
TOMORROW MORNING IN THE COMMONS THE 
GOVERNMENT WILL GET A REAL FEEL OF 
JUST HOW SERIOUS OUR INTENT IS NOT 
TO VOTE AGAINST OUR CORE BELIEF TO 
PROTECT THE POOREST 
THAT LOWER 
BASIC RATE WAS PAID FOR BY 
SCRAPPING THE TEN P. RATE A DECISION 
THAT IS ESTIMATED COULD HIT FIFTY THREE 
MILLION HOUSEHOLDS IN THE POCKET 
MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE WHO EARN 
LESS THAN NINETEEN THOUSAND A YEAR WITH NO 
CHILDREN AND WHO ARE UNDER TWENTY FIVE OF 
THOSE THE WORST AFFECTED COULD END 
UP LOSING TWO HUNDRED THIRTY A YEAR LABOUR M. P.'S 
RETURNING TO WESTMINSTER WILL BE 
TOLD THE ONLY OPTION IS EXTRA HELP 
AT FUTURE BUDGETS THAT WON'T BUY 
OFF THE HARDLINERS OR THE 
OPPOSITION 
SHOULD REOPEN THE OPPOSITION PACKAGE PRESENTED AT LAST YEAR'S 
BUDGET WHICH WE COMPLAINED ABOUT AS 
A TAX CON AND LOOK AT HOW WE CAN 
HELP THE FIFTY TWO MILLION PEOPLE ON LOW 
INCOMES WHO ARE GOING TO SEE THEIR 
TAX GO UP 
WHAT THE LABOUR 
BACKBENCHERS SEE IS THAT THE WAY 
THIS IS BEING FINANCED IS BY TAKING 
IT AWAY FROM PEOPLE RIGHT AT THE 
VERY BOTTOM THERE ARE CERTAINLY 
CERTAIN GROUPS OF PEOPLE 
PARTICULARLY SINGLE YOUNGER WORKERS 
WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE TAX 
CREDIT SYSTEM WHO WILL BE 
ABSOLUTELY WORSE OFF 
MANY LABOUR 
M. P.'S FEAR THAT DOWNING STREET HASN'T 
YET GRASPED THE SCALE OF THE 
PROBLEM BROUGHT ON BY MR. BROWN'S 
LAST BUDGET 
LET'S GO LIVE NOW TO JAMES IN 
DOWNING STREET LET'S JUST EXPLORE 
THIS POINT ABOUT THE CHANCELLOR OR 
THE PRIME MINISTER ARE THEY REALLY 
SPEAKING AS ONE WITH ONE MESSAGE ON 
THIS 
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY FAIR TO THIS SAY THERE ARE TENSIONS WITHIN THE 
GOVERNMENT I WOULDN'T PUT IT 
STRONGER THAN THAT AT THE MOMENT 
BUT A LOT OF MINISTERS FEEL THAT MR. 
BROWN SEE THIS AS SOME KIND OF 
ECONOMIC PROBLEM WHICH CAN BE 
EXPLAINED AWAY IN THE CONTEXT OF 
ALL THE OTHER HELP LABOUR HAS GIVEN 
TO LOW PAID FAMILIES OVER THE LAST 
TEN YEARS THE MESSAGE THOUGH 
THIS MINISTERS AND M. P.'S HAVE BEEN 
GETTING BACK IN THEIR 
CONSISTUENCIES DURING THE EASTER 
HOLIDAYS IS A RATHER MORE 
DIFFERENTS WIDER POLITICAL AND 
PRETTY CORROSIVE POLITICAL PROBLEM 
WHICH COULD COST THEM VOTES IN THE 
ENGLISH AND WELSH COUNCIL ELECTIONS 
NEXT WEEK MR. DARLING DOES SEEM TO 
HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE PROBLEM 
IS HE HASN'T GOT ANY MONEY TO DO 
ANYTHING AT IT 
THE RMER DEPUTY 
PRIME MINISTER HAS REVEALED THAT HE 
SUFFERED FROM THE EATING DISORDER 
BULIMIA FOR TEN YEARS HE SAYS 
SHAME AND EMBARRASSMENT PREVENTED 
HIM FROM ADMITTING TO THE PROBLEM 
BEFORE BUT HE HOPES OTHER PEOPLE 
AFFECTED WILL NOT SUFFER IN SILENCE 
OUR CORRESPONDENT DANNY SAVAGE HAS 
BEEN SPEAKING TO HIM 
BY HIS OWN ADMISSION JOHN PRESCOTT 
IS A MAN WHO LOVES HIS FOOD AND 
AFTER LABOUR CAME TO POWER IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN 
IN HIS OWN WORDS HE ATE ANY OLD 
RUBBISH BUT OUT OF THE PUBLIC EYE 
HE WAS OFTEN SICK AFTERWARDS A 
CLASSIC SYMPTOM OF BULIMIA HE'S 
WRITTEN ABOUT SUFFERING FROM IT IN 
HIS NEW BOOK BUT TODAY SAID IT WAS 
HARD TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE 
STIGMA OF THE CONDITION 
I NEVER 
ADMITTED TO THIS OUT OF THE SHAME 
AND EMBARRASSMENT L. FOUND IT 
DIFFICULT MAN LIKE ME TO ADMIT 
THAT I SUFFERED FROM BULIMIA THE 
DOCTORS TOLD ME IT WAS PROBABLY DUE 
TO STRESS 
HOW DIFFICULT WAS IT TO 
GO AND SEEK TREATMENT 
IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO ADMIT IT AND GO AND 
WHEN YOU'RE A PUBLIC OFFICIAL HOW 
DO YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO STAY 
SECRET BUT YOU NEED TO TAKE 
MEDICAL ADVICE YOU DO HAVE TO GET 
OVER THAT THAT'S WHY I WANT TO SAY 
TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DO TAKE 
ADVICE IT CAN HELP AND IT CAN 
HELP YOU OUT OF A LOT OF MISERY 
THAT YOU SUFFER IN SILENCE MR. MR PRESCOTT'S ADMISSION IS LIKELY TO 
HIGHLIGHT THE PLIGHT OF THE ELEVEN 
MILLION PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM 
EATING DISORDERS IN THE U. K. OUT OF 
THOSE ONE IN TEN ARE THOUGHT TO BE 
MEN BULIMIA IS THE MOST COMMON 
EATING DISORDER THE AVERAGE AGE OF 
A SUFFERER IS BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY ONE 
YEARS OLD 
IT'S EXTREMELY UNUSUAL 
IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR A MAN OF THIS 
AGE TO PRESENT WITH THIS PROBLEM 
AND IT DOES MAKE ME WONDER WHETHER 
THERE IS A SILENT NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
OUT THERE THAT AREN'T SEEKING THE 
APPROPRIATE HELP 
MR. PRESCOTT SAYS 
HE HASN'T SUFFERED FROM THE 
DISORDER FOR SOME TIME AND STILL 
EATS THE FOOD HE LIKES 
THE RMER 
DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER HAS ALSO 
ADMITTED TODAY THAT ONE OF HIS 
FAVOURITE PLACES TO EAT IN THE 
ENTIRE WORLD IS THIS CHINESE 
RESTAURANT MR. CHU'S IN HULL WHERE 
MR. PRESCOTT SAYS HE COULD EAT HIS 
WAY THROUGH THE ENTIRE MENU JOHN 
PRESCOTT SAYS BY BEING OPEN HE 
HOPES THAT THE STIGMA ATTACHED TO 
EATING DISORDERS CAN BE ADDRESSED 
THE POPE HAS PRAYED FOR THE VICTIMS 
OF THE SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH ATTACKS ON 
VISIT TO GROUND ZERO IN NEW YORK 
HE CALLED THE SITE A SCENE OF 
INCREDIBLE VIOLENCE AND PAIN 
BEFORE MOVING ON TO YANKEE STADIUM 
FOR THE FINAL MASS OF HIS U. S. TOUR 
FROM NEW YORK MATHEW PRICE REPORTS 
THEY STOPPED THE BUILDING WORK AT 
GROUND ZERO TODAY THEN FELL SILENT 
AS THE POPE ARRIVED AT THE SITE 
WHERE THE NORTH TOWER OF THE WORLD 
TRADE CENTER ONCE STOOD THEY 
PRAYED EMERGENCY WORKERS AND THE 
FAMILIES OF VICTIMS A HANDFUL 
REPRESENTING THE STILL FIERCE PAIN 
OF AN ENTIRE NATION 
GOD OF PEACE 
BRING YOUR PEACE TO OUR VIOLENT 
WORLD PEACE INTO THE HEARTS OF OUR 
MEN AND WOMEN AND PEACE AMONGST THE 
NATIONS OF THE EARTH TURN TO YOUR 
WAY OF LOST SOULS WHOSE HEARTS AND 
MINDS ARE CONSUMED WITH HATRED 
IT'S BEEN A VISIT OF SURPRISES HE 
WAS THE FIRST VISITING DIGNITARY TO 
BE MET BY PRESIDENT BUSH AT THE 
AIRPORT HE'S ALSO ADDRESSED TWO 
ISSUES MANY MIGHT EXPECT HIM TO SHY 
AWAY FROM CHILD ABUSE WITHIN THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH AND HIS OWN 
EXPERIENCES OF GROWING UP IN NAZI 
GERMANY AS THIS VISIT COMES TO A 
CONCLUSION HERE AT YANKEE STADIUM 
IT'S CLEAR THE VATICAN BELIEVES IT 
HAS BEEN A SUCCESS THE POPE'S BEEN 
ABLE TO GET ACROSS BOTH HIS PAST 
ORORAL MESSAGE PASTORAL MESSAGES 
AND HIS POLITICAL ONES MORE THAN 
THAT HE'S ALSO PRESENTED A 
PERSONAL FACE TO THE AMERICAN 
PUBLIC AND THEY APPEAR TO HAVE 
WARMED TO HIM THIS EVENING FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND 
HAVE PACKED YANKEE STADIUM WHERE 
THE POPE IS CELEBRATING MASS 
FITTING END TO VISIT WHICH HAS 
DONE MUCH TO BRING THE PONTIFF 
CLOSER TO HIS PEOPLE 
ZIMBABWE'S OPPOSITION THE M. D. C. 
SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY IS NOW IN A 
STATE OF UNDECLARED WAR IN THE 
AFTER MATH OF LAST MONTH'S 
ELECTIONS RECOUNT IS CONTINUING IN 
SOME CONSISTUENCIES BUT THE M. D. C. 
HAS RULED OUT TAKING PART IN

DEFENCE OFFICIALS SAY AN R. A. F. 
HELICOPTER FLIGHT BY PRINCE WILLIAM

THE CHINOOK HELICOPTER LANDED FOR 
ABOUT TWENTY SECONDS NO ONE GOT ON 
AND NO ONE GOT OFF THEN THE PRINCE 
FLEW BACK AGAIN BUT IT'S THE TRIP 
WILLIAM TOOK IMMEDIATELY AFTER 
GRADUATING THAT'S CAUSED THE MOST 
CONTROVERSY THE PRINCE FLEW A 
CHINOOK FROM R. A. F. CRANWELL TO LONDON 
WHERE HE PICKED UP HIS BROTHER 
HARRY THE R. A. F. SAYS THIS WAS PART 
OF AN EXERCISE TO PILOT A 
HELICOPTER THROUGH BUSY FLYING 
LANES HE THEN FLEW ONTO THE ISLE 
OF WIGHT OFFICIALS SAY THIS WAS TO 
MAKE WATER CROSSING AND APPROACH 
TO CIVILIAN AIRFIELD THIS 
PICTURE TAKEN ON THE ISLAND SHOWS 
WILLIAM THEN WENT ON TO JOIN HIS 
COUSIN PETER PHILLIPS TO CELEBRATE 
A STAG WEEKEND 
IT'S A WASTE OF 
SCARCE TRAINING HOURS ON THE 
CHINOOK YOU KNOW THE MONEY SPENT 
ON THAT SORTIE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE 
BEEN BETTER SPENT ON TRAINING A GUY 
WHO'S ACTUALLY GOING TO FLY A 
CHINOOK AS HIS CAREER RATHER THAN 
SOMEONE WHO'S MERELY GOING TO BE 
THE C. AND C. OF THE R. A. F. THE THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE SAYS THE 
PRINCE'S TRAINING WAS DESIGNED TO 
GIVE HIM AN INSIGHT INTO THE MANY 
ROLES OF THE ROYAL AIR FORCE
