I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED BY THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE BRITISH IN INDIA 
NOT CONTENT WITH PLUNDERING THIS VAST COUNTRY FOR ITS NATURAL RESOURCES 
THEY EMBARKED ON THE GRANDER WEIRDER PROJECT OF MAKING INDIA AS BRITISH AS POSSIBLE 
THIS OFTEN LED TO ACTS OF TERRIBLE BRUTALITY 
IT ALSO LED TO LABOUR INTENSIVE HEROIC WORKS WHICH PERHAPS 
HELPED TO EASE THE PANGS OF HOMESICKNESS 
THE EVIDENCE OF THESE PROJECTS CAN STILL BE SEEN TODAY 
ONE OF THE GREATEST OF THESE ENTERPRISES WAS THE GREAT ARC 
IT TOOK FIFTY YEARS AND THE LIVES OF FIFTY MEN TO COMPLETE 
THE CULMINATION OF THIS ENORMOUS PROJECT WAS A PIECE OF PAPER A MAP 
THROUGH IT THE BRITISH HOPED TO SHOW THAT THEY ALONE RULED INDIA 
AFTER ALL TO MEASURE IS TO CONTROL 
IT WAS THE MOST AMBITIOUS LAND SURVEY EVER UNDERTAKEN 
IT ESTABLISHED THE EARTH'S SHAPE 
AND LED TO THE DISCOVERY OF ITS HIGHEST MOUNTAIN 
MOST OF ALL IT WAS INSANELY DARING 
I'VE COME TO INDIA TO FOLLOW THE TRAIL OF THE GREAT ARC 
IT BEGAN IN THE SOUTH AND ENDED UP IN THE HIMALAYAS 
A DISTANCE OF THREE THOUSAND MILES 
THE MEN WHO DID IT USED ONLY CUMBERSOME INSTRUMENTS AND ELEMENTARY TRIGONOMETRY 
THEY HAD TO CONTEND WITH EXTREME HEAT 
FROSTBITE MALARIA WILD ANIMALS AND HOSTILE LOCALS IN SHORT THEY WERE UP AGAINST INDIA ITSELF 
AND ALL TOO OFTEN INDIA WON 
IT WAS OF THE ORDER OF THE MAPPING OF D. N. A. OR THE CONQUEST OF SPACE 
AS A LONG TERM MAJOR MULTINATIONAL 
UM SCIENTIFIC UNDERTAKING 
IT PRODUCED THE MOST COMPLEX MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS KNOWN 
IN THE PRE COMPUTER AGE 
AND IT RESULTED IN INDIA BECOMING THE BEST MAPPED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE WESTERN EUROPE 
THE GREAT ARC IS THE BRAINCHILD OF THIS MAN WILLIAM LAMBTON 
BUT HIS SUCCESSOR GEORGE EVEREST'S DRIVE BROUGHT IT TO COMPLETION 
HIS NAME WAS GIVEN TO THE GREAT ARC'S MOST FABULOUS DISCOVERY 
THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN IN THE WORLD 
ONE CAN'T HELP FEELING AMUSEMENT 
THAT THIS PEDANTIC AND SEVERE MAN HAS HIS NAME MISPROUNOUNCED 
EVERY TIME ANYONE SAYS MOUNT EVEREST 
THIS IS THE SURVEY OF INDIA BUILT BY EVEREST IN THE SMALL NORTH INDIAN HILL TOWN OF DEHRA DUN 
APART FROM THE MAP IT PRODUCED 
EVERYTHING ABOUT GEORGE EVEREST'S ENTERPRISE WAS ON A GRAND SCALE 
SO WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THE GREAT ARC THAT EXERCISED SUCH ALLURE 
PEOPLE LOVE MAKING MAPS THEY'VE BEEN AT IT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
I THINK THERE IS A FETISHIST DESIRE TO TURN THE WORLD INTO A PICTURE 
THIS NOTION OF A PICTOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATION WHICH IS QUITE CRUDE 
OF SOMEWHERE THAT GIVES YOU A PLACE IN THE WORLD 
I THINK WE'RE ALL SO AWARE OF OUR INFINITESIMAL TININESS OF SCALE 
THE VERY EARLY MAPS WHERE YOU'D SEE BEASTS AND MONSTERS 
AND HOUSES COMPLETELY OUT OF SCALE 
WOULD GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE WORLD AS A FABULOUS FICTION 
PEOPLE HAD A GOOD IDEA OF THE SHAPE OF EUROPE BY THE RENAISSANCE 
BUT INDIA WAS WAY BEHIND 
WESTERNERS ONLY MAPPED THE COAST TO GET THEIR MERCHANT SHIPS INTO PORT 
IN EARLY MAPS THERE IS ALMOST NO INTEREST IN THE INTERIOR 
INDIAN MATHEMATICIANS AND SURVEYORS WERE MORE CONCERNED WITH HEAVEN 
THIS OBSERVATORY WAS BUILT IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BY THE ASTRONOMER KING JAI SINGH 
MAPPING GROUND WAS A LESS PRECISE BUSINESS 
AND OFTEN TIED IN WITH RELIGIOUS NOTIONS 
ABOUT MAN'S PLACE IN THE COSMOS 
IN THIS BUDDHIST MAP RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE HAS THE LAST WORD 
THE WORLD IS A LOTUS FLOWER SIBERIA IS A GIANT PETAL 
THERE ISN'T MUCH ASTRONOMY GOING ON NOW 
BEHIND EVERY PILLAR A YOUNG COUPLE TRIES TO SNATCH SOME PRIVACY 
AWAY FROM THE EYES OF CONSERVATIVE SOCIETY 
WHILE INDIANS WERE GAZING AT THE STARS OR INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES 
THE BRITISH WERE MEASURING THE GROUND BENEATH THEIR FEET 
THEY WANTED TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT THEY'D GOT 
IN SIXTEEN HUNDRED ELIZABETH I GAVE THE EAST INDIA COMPANY A ROYAL CHARTER 
TO SET UP TRADING POSTS IN INDIA 
THIS IT HAD DONE 
BUT THREATENED BY LOCAL RULERS AND THE ENVIOUS FRENCH IT GREW FROM A TRADING BODY TO A GOVERNING ONE 
AT THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY BRITAIN FINDS ITSELF POSSESSING 
HUGE CHUNKS OF INDIA IT HAD NEVER KNOWN ABOUT BEFORE 
THE MAPPING OF INDIA IS PART OF A PROCESS OF GOVERNING OF INDIA 
PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW HOW TO GET FROM A TO B. 
AND HOW TO RULE THIS AREA THEY'VE GOT POSSESSION OF 
THE EAST INDIA COMPANY'S FIRST SURVEYOR GENERAL JAMES RENNELL 
PRODUCED A MAP OF HINDUSTAN IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR 
IT WAS DEEPLY INACCURATE 
AND LEFT HUGE TRACTS OF LAND ENTIRELY EMPTY 
IT WAS ADEQUATE FOR THE TIME 
BUT EVERYTHING CHANGED WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE NEW GOVERNOR GENERAL RICHARD WELLESLEY 
WELLESLEY WAS AN UNATTRACTIVE CHARACTER BUT A VERY BRILLIANT MAN 
HE WAS SMALL ARROGANT HE WAS SELF POSSESSED 
HE GOES OUT TO INDIA 
INTENT ON CONQUERING INDIA 
IT'S A NEW ATTITUDE OF SUPERIORITY OF ARROGANCE OF PURE LAND GRABBING 
WHILE MILITARY MIGHT IS ONE ASPECT OF TAKING CONTROL OVER A REGION ANOTHER IS THE LAND SURVEY 
KNOWLEDGE AFTER ALL IS POWER 
THE FIRST STAGE OF POSSESSION OF SAYING THIS IS OUR TERRITORY IS THE MAP 
THE FIRST THING WAS THE VARIOUS POWERS STRUGGLING TO MAKE MOON MAPS 
THAT SAY THIS HAS A FLAG THIS IS AMERICAN THIS IS RUSSIAN 
SAME WITH INDIA INDIA IN A SENSE BELONGS TO WHOEVER MAPS INDIA 
ENTER BRIGADE MAJOR WILLIAM LAMBTON WHO HAD BEEN MARKED OUT FOR BRAVERY 
IN THE SUCCESSFUL WAR AGAINST TIPU SULTAN 
IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
SLAUGHTER HAD BEEN REQUIRED IN THAT JOB BUT HIS PASSION WAS MAPPING 
LAMBTON WROTE TO GOVERNOR GENERAL WELLESLEY WITH A UNIQUE PROPOSAL 
HE WANTED TO MAP THE ENTIRE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT 
TO THE NEAREST INCH A STANDARD OF ACCURACY 
ONLY SO FAR ACHIEVED IN BRITAIN AND FRANCE WHICH WERE SMALLER AND BELONGED TO THE PEOPLE MAPPING THEM 
THIS WOULD BE THE LARGEST MOST EXPENSIVE SURVEYING PROJECT EVER ATTEMPTED 
AMAZINGLY THIS AMBITIOUS AND IMPRACTICAL PROPOSAL WAS THE SORT OF GRAND OVERBLOWN PROJECT 
GOVERNOR GENERAL WELLESLEY LIKED TO PROMOTE 
IN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED 
THE GREAT ARC WAS APPROVED 
AND BEGUN 
BUT THE PUZZLING PART IS TO INSIST THAT THE MAP BE INCH PERFECT 
TO DO SOMETHING MORE VAGUE WOULD BE CHEAPER AND TAKE LESS TIME 
BUT LAMBTON HAD ANOTHER MOTIVE 
AT EVERY STAGE IN HISTORY THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD HAS BEEN DOMINATED 
BY A QUEST 
IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IT WAS GEOGRAPHIC 
ONCE WESTERN PHILOSOPHERS AGREED THE WORLD WAS ROUND 
THEY THEN BEGAN TO ARGUE ABOUT WHAT KIND OF ROUND IT WAS 
UNTIL ITS EXACT CURVATURE WAS ESTABLISHED 
NO LOCATION HAD AN ACCURATE LONGITUDE OR LATITUDE 
LAMBTON HOPED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL 
THE GREAT ARC WAS TO RUN UP THE LENGTH OF INDIA AND ALSO TO RUN UP 
THE LENGTH OF A MERIDIANAL LINE 
A PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF A LENGTH OF THIS LINE 
BY EXTENDING IT AROUND THE EARTH'S SPHERE WOULD MEASURE THE WORLD 
AS IT FOLLOWED PART OF EARTH'S CURVATURE 
THE SURVEY BECAME KNOWN AS THE GREAT ARC 
LAMBTON'S SURVEY WAS AN IMPRESSIVE PROPOSAL 
HOW DID HE HOPE TO MAKE AN INCH PERFECT MAP OF THIS COUNTRY 
BEFORE THE DAYS OF SATELLITE IMAGERY 
PLAN FOR THE SURVEYING OF HINDUSTAN THROUGH TRIANGULATION 
THE PRINCIPLE IS THIS 
BY MEASURING ONE STRETCH OF LAND 
AND A POINT APPROXIMATELY EQUIDISTANT FROM BOTH ENDS 
ONE CAN USE TRIGONOMETRY TO ESTABLISH THE OTHER TWO LENGTHS 
THESE CAN BE USED FOR FURTHER TRIANGLES 
CREATING A WEB OF MEASURED AREAS ACROSS THE GEOGRAPHICAL SUBJECT 
THE SIZE OF THESE TRIANGLES WAS LIMITED 
THE POINTS WERE NO FURTHER APART THAN THAT SEEN THROUGH A TELESCOPE 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWO TWENTY MILES WAS ABOUT AS FAR AS ONE COULD HOPE FOR 
IN THE CASE OF INDIA THAT'S A LOT OF TRIANGLES 
I'M STANDING ON ONE OF THE MARKERS USED IN MEASURING THE GREAT ARC 
ANOTHER IS TWENTY MILES THAT WAY 
LAMBTON COULD SPEND UP TO FIVE MONTHS MEASURING AND RE MEASURING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO MARKERS 
UNTIL HE WAS CONVINCED IT WAS ACCURATE 
FOR THE THIRD POINT IN ONE OF HIS SURVEYING TRIANGLES 
LAMBTON NEEDED A PLACE WHERE A FLAG COULD BE SEEN THROUGH A TELESCOPE 
SOUTH INDIA IS DOTTED WITH SMALL HILLS WHICH WERE PERFECT FOR THIS PURPOSE 
WHEN IT BECAME EASIER TO MAP THINGS 
IT WAS DUE TO THE THEODOLITE 
WHICH WERE A DEVELOPMENT OF 
A SURVEYING LEVEL AND SIGHTING TUBE FROM THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
THIS IS AN EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY ONE 
IN ITS FORM IT'S VERY REPRESENTATIVE OF A THEODOLITE 
A TELESCOPE MOUNTED OVER A COMPASS 
AGAIN BUBBLE LEVELS THIS TOO WOULD BE MOUNTED ON A TRIPOD THOUGH IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE 
YOU CAN SET IT UP WITH THE LEVELS AND THE COMPASS AT THE EXACT POINT 
THEN ADJUST THE TELESCOPE WHICH HAS A CROSS HAIR SIGHT IN IT 
ON WHATEVER POINT YOU'RE CHECKING OUT SO YOU CAN TELL THE ANGLE 
BECAUSE OF THE ACCURACY NEEDED 
LAMBTON ACQUIRED THIS THE GREAT THEODOLITE 
IT ALLOWED FOR PRECISE MEASUREMENTS 
THIS HAD A DOWNSIDE IT WEIGHED HALF A TONNE AND NEEDED TWELVE PEOPLE TO CARRY IT 
THE PROGRESS OF THIS ENORMOUS INSTRUMENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY CAUSED A CONSIDERABLE STIR 
MANY COMMUNITIES WERE UNFAMILIAR WITH WESTERN FACES LET ALONE WESTERN TECHNOLOGIES 
IT WAS EVEN WORSHIPPED AS A CHARM CHILDLESS BRIDES WOULD TOUCH IT IN THE HOPE OF FERTILITY 
FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS LAMBTON AND HIS STAFF LABOURED ACROSS INDIA 
SPREADING THEIR WEB OF TRIANGLES 
THOUSANDS WERE EMPLOYED 
SURVEYORS WOULD TRAVEL WITH THEIR FAMILIES IN TOW 
THERE WAS ONE GROUP WHO BENEFITED FROM THIS ANGLO INDIAN CHILDREN 
IF YOU WERE AN ANGLO INDIAN IN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED 
THE FUTURE WOULD BE UNCERTAIN 
YOU CAN'T JOIN THE EAST INDIA COMPANY OR THE CIVIL SERVICE 
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF RESTRICTIONS 
SO A JOB IN THE SURVEY DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN ATTRACTIVE 
IT WAS WELL PAID AND AWAY FROM SOCIETY WHERE YOU MAY BE SNEERED AT 
YOU HAD THE TERMS CHUTNEY MARYS BLACKIE WHITIES 
THESE RACIST TERMS ARE BEING COINED FOR THE FIRST TIME 
AND BEING USED DERISORILY FOR THE FIRST TIME AROUND EIGHTEEN HUNDRED 
BY THE TIME LAMBTON DIED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY THREE 
THE GREAT ARC WAS IN CRISIS 
EAST INDIA COMPANY OFFICIALS WERE QUESTIONING THE EXPENSE AND LACK OF RESULTS 
THE PROJECT MAY HAVE GROUND TO A HALT WHERE IT NOT FOR GEORGE EVEREST THE NEW SURVEYOR GENERAL 
IT WAS HERE IN SAINT ALFRED'S CHURCH IN GREENWICH THAT EVEREST WAS BAPTISED 
AND PERHAPS GROWING UP A STONE'S THROW FROM THE ROYAL NAVAL COLLEGE THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY 
IMPORTANT PLACES FOR MAPMAKERS HIS DESTINY WAS FIXED FROM THE START THIS GUY WAS BORN TO MAP 
AT SIXTEEN HE WAS SENT TO THE COLONIES TO JOIN THE EAST INDIA COMPANY 
AT TWENTY EIGHT HE JOINED THE TRIGONOMETRICAL SURVEY BUT HIS FIRST TRIP INTO THE FIELD WAS NOT A SUCCESS 
HE CONDUCTED A SURVEY DURING WHICH I THINK HIS ENTIRE PARTY 
HIMSELF AND HIS ASSISTANT INCLUDED WENT DOWN WITH MALARIA 
AND HAD TO BE CARRIED BACK TO THE CITY OF HYDERABAD 
QUITE A FEW OF THEM NEVER RECOVERED 
I THINK THERE WERE OUT OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY DIED 
EVEREST HIMSELF WAS A SICK MAN FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE 
GEORGE EVEREST WAS PARTLY TO BLAME HE OBSESSIVELY URGED HIS TEAM ON 
DESPITE WARNINGS OF TYPHUS AND WHEN UNDERSTANDABLY THEY MUTINIED HE THREATENED TO SHOOT THEM 
AND HAD THEM FLOGGED 
HE MUST'VE BEEN ABSOLUTELY FRIGHTFUL TO WORK WITH 
A TOTALLY RUTHLESSLY SINGLE MINDED 
UM BUT I SUSPECT ALSO A COMPLETE PERFECTIONIST 
HE WAS EXTREMELY SHORT TEMPERED DEMANDING 
NOT AT ALL ENDEARING HE WAS SO SENSITIVE TO ANY SLEEP DISTURBANCE 
WHILE HE SLEPT WAS TO BE SHOT 
EVEREST WASN'T ASHAMED OF THE WAY HE TREATED HIS SUBORDINATES 
AS A THOROUGH DIARIST HE RECORDED THE DAILY INSULTS WITH WHICH HE THREATENED HIS STAFF 
THIS ENTIRE VOLUME OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN PAGES CONSISTS OF LETTERS OF COMPLAINT 
FROM EVEREST TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY 
IN IT HE RAILS AGAINST EVERYONE FROM THE FELLOWS 
DOWN TO THE INDIANS EMPLOYED TO CONDUCT THE DAILY BUSINESS OF THE SURVEY HERE'S A FLAVOUR 
WE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT ALL THE INFERIOR PARTS OF THE DRAMA 
MUST BE ENACTED BY NATIVES OR AS THE AMERICANS CALL THEM NIGGERS 
PERSONS WHO MAY SPEAK IN A SMATTERING OF HALF ENGLISH BUT WHOSE IDEAS HABITS AND LANGUAGE 
ARE EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAVE DERIVED FROM THE UNADULTERATED IMPRESSIONS OF EARLY YOUTH 
YOU'RE WEARING ME TO FIDDLE STRINGS ABOUT THIS DELHI RAY 
IF YOU DO NOT TAKE SOME PAINS YOU WILL NEVER SUCCEED AND I MAY BE DETAINED FOR THE NEXT SIX YEARS 
YOU ARE MISMANAGING BADLY YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE UNCERTAIN PERSONS IN WHOM NO CONFIDENCE CAN BE PLACED 
IT SEEMS THAT YOU WILL NOT ABIDE BY MY ORDERS 
BUT PELL MELL FOUL OR FAIR IS THE ONLY MEANS WE HAVE OF GETTING THROUGH OUR WORK 
YOU ALL SEEM TO ME TO BE RIGHT STARK RAVING MAD 
ALTHOUGH THE IMPRESSION ONE GETS FROM GEORGE EVEREST'S WRITINGS 
IS OF A POMPOUS BULLYING SELF IMPORTANT PEDANT 
STILL ONE CAN'T ENVY HIM THE MAGNITUDE OF HIS TASK 
YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE AN ABSOLUTE FAITH IN THE WAY THE MAPPING WAS DONE 
THAT BY EMPLOYING TRIANGULATIONS AND DEVICES OF SURVEYING 
IT WILL REVEAL ITSELF TO YOU BUT DOING THAT ON AN ENORMOUS SCALE 
THE MOMENT COMES WHEN YOU THINK THIS ISN'T HOW THINGS ARE 
IT'S HOT I'M SICK I'M ILL I'VE BEEN BITTEN BY BUGS 
I CAN'T DO IT I CAN'T CARRY ON WITH THIS MATHEMATICAL ABSTRACTION CAN'T KEEP IT ON GRAPH PAPER 
IT'S MOVING AWAY FROM ME 
EVEN TODAY WITH ALL MOD CONS AND NO THEODOLITE TO LUG AROUND 
TRAVELLING DURING THE MONSOON CAN BE PRETTY GRUELLING 
HE SOON REALISED THAT DETERMINATION ALONE WOULDN'T GET THE JOB DONE 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THE GREAT ARC WAS STILL FAR FROM FINISHED 
AND PROGRESS WAS GETTING HARDER 
WHILE THE SOUTH OF INDIA WAS DOTTED WITH HILLS AND TEMPLES FOR FLAGS 
THE NORTH GAVE WAY TO THE VAST HINDUSTAN PLAINS 
THE FLAT HEAT HAZY LAND MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SURVEYORS TO CONTINUE NEW TACTICS WERE NEEDED 
AND MORE MONEY EVEREST RETURNED TO ENGLAND TO CAMPAIGN FOR EXTRA FUNDS 
WENT OUT TO FEED IN A FIELD OF HIGH CORN AND WERE SHOT 
QUESTIONS 
IT IS NOW MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS SINCE THE SURVEY BEGAN 
AND YET THE BULK OF THE SUBCONTINENT REMAINS UNCHARTERED 
THE TASK GENTLEMEN TAKES SUCH TIME BECAUSE IT IS ALMOST WHOLLY IMPRACTICAL 
THE EXPEDITIONS ARE REGULARLY IMPEDED BY ELEPHANT 
HYENA TIGER SCORPION AND DISOBEDIENT NATIVE 
A SURVEYING PARTY MUST CONSIST OF TWENTY FOUR MEN TO CARRY THE GREAT THEODOLITE 
A FURTHER BATTALION OF HARDY INDIVIDUALS TO CLEAR THE SIGHT LINES OF BANYAN TREE AND NATIVE HOUSING 
IN SHORT GENTLEMEN NO FEWER THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MEN NOT INCLUDING ELEPHANTS AND HORSES 
THIS IS NOT A SHOOTING PARTY GENTLEMEN BUT A SMALL ARMY 
FIGHTING ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT CAMPAIGNS EVER ENVISAGED 
AND IT REQUIRES THE FUNDING OF SUCH 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY ONE GEORGE EVEREST RETURNED TO INDIA WITH NEW FUNDS TO PUSH THE GREAT ARC THROUGH TO COMPLETION 
IN ORDER TO WORK UNHINDERED BY THE EAST INDIA COMPANY'S CLOYING BUREAUCRACY 
HE MOVED THE SURVEY'S OFFICES AWAY FROM CALCUTTA 
BY BASING HIMSELF HERE IN NORTHERLY DEHRA DUN 
HE WAS EXPRESSING THE DETERMINATION TO DO SOMETHING 
HIS PREDECESSOR WILLIAM LAMBTON COULD NEVER HAVE IMAGINED 
TO DRAG THE GREAT ARC RIGHT ACROSS THE HINDUSTAN PLAINS 
SINCE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND NATURAL VANTAGE POINTS FOR MARKERS 
GEORGE EVEREST HAD FOURTEEN OF THESE BRICK TOWERS BUILT ACROSS THE NORTH OF THE COUNTRY AT VAST EXPENSE 
HE ALSO NEEDED TO FIND A WAY TO GET AROUND THE EXTREME HEAT HAZE IN THE NORTHERN PLAINS 
THAT MADE SIGHT MEASUREMENT UNRELIABLE 
FINALLY HE HIT UPON THE IDEA OF SURVEYING AT NIGHT 
HEAT HAZE IS MINIMISED WHICH MEANS THE CLEAR AIR ALLOWS YOU TO SEE MUCH FURTHER 
THE GREAT ARC BECAME A NOCTURNAL BEAST 
EVEREST AND HIS SURVEYORS WOULD SPEND THEIR NIGHTS WAITING FOR THE GLOW OF SIGNAL TORCHES 
ON THESE EXCURSIONS SCANNING THE NIGHT SKY 
EVEREST WOULD'VE BEEN REMINDED OF THE ULTIMATE AIM OF THE GREAT ARC TO FIND THE TRUE SHAPE OF THE WORLD 
AS GEORGE EVEREST BROUGHT THE GREAT ARC TO ITS CONCLUSION 
HE BEGAN TO MAKE ASTRONOMICAL CALCULATIONS WHICH'D ALLOW HIM TO COMPUTE THE SHAPE OF THE EARTH 
BOTH CENTRAL AMBITIONS OF THE GREAT ARC COMPLETE HE RETIRED TO ENGLAND HE'D LABOURED FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
I HAVE THIS TERRIBLY SAD SENSE OF HIM WHEN HE CAME BACK TO BRITAIN 
LIVING IN LONDON WALKING THE GREY STREETS OF BAYSWATER 
WITH HIS MEMORIES OF THE SMELLS AND COLOURS OF THE INDIAN CONTINENT 
AND PROBABLY UNABLE TO NOT TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT 
THE WAY YOU DO WHEN YOU COME BACK FROM SOMEWHERE TOTALLY EXOTIC 
AND EVERYONE LOOKING SLIGHTLY BORED MUST HAVE BEEN PAINFUL 
THE ETERNAL QUESTION GENTLEMEN 
THAT MAN HAS ASKED HIMSELF EVER SINCE HE WAS EXPELLED FROM THE GARDEN OF EDEN 
WHAT IS THE EXACT SHAPE OF THE EARTH 
I GEORGE EVEREST HAVE NOW ANSWERED THAT QUESTION 
THE COMPRESSION OF THE POLES 
IN RELATION TO THE DIAMETER OF THE EQUATOR IS ONE TO THREE HUNDRED ELEVEN THOUSAND FORTY FOUR 
ANY QUESTIONS 
THE LAST POST 
HAVING FOLLOWED PART OF THE GREAT ARC 
AND BEGUN TO GET A FEEL FOR THE ENTERPRISE AND SUFFERING THAT WENT INTO ITS CREATION 
EVEREST'S OBSCURE CALCULATIONS ABOUT THE SHAPE OF THE WORLD COME AS A BIT OF AN ANTI CLIMAX 
IT'S HARDLY THE SECRET OF LIFE MY JOURNEY BRINGS ME TO THE MOUNTAINS 
WHERE EVEREST BUILT HIS INDIAN HOME 
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY MELANCHOLY ABOUT THESE HILL TOP ESTATES 
LITTLE BITS OF ENGLAND HIDDEN AMONGST THE CLOUDS FAILING TO RECREATE THE COSINESS OF HOME 
THEIR OCCUPANTS MUST HAVE BEEN VERY HOMESICK UNABLE TO COME TO TERMS WITH THIS EXTRAORDINARY COUNTRY 
THIS PLACE ONCE REPRESENTED THE HEIGHT OF THE SURVEY'S POWER 
ALL THAT REMAINS ARE A FEW GOAT DROPPINGS AND A BIT OF PLASTERWORK 
BY MAPPING INDIA MAYBE EVEREST HOPED TO PROVE HIS MASTERY OF IT 
IN SOME WAYS HE SUCCEEDED 
BUT THE PIECE OF PAPER AND SHORT MATHEMATICAL EQUATION PRODUCED DOESN'T SEEM TO JUSTIFY THE EFFORT 
TEN YEARS AFTER ITS COMPLETION THE ARC LED TO A GREAT DISCOVERY 
BY THE TIME EVEREST RETIRED HE HAD LAID A NETWORK OF TRIANGLES ALL OVER INDIA 
SOME WERE ALONG THE PLANES OF NORTH INDIA WHERE IT JOINS NEPAL 
POLITICALLY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GO INTO NEPAL 
THE BEST THE SURVEYORS COULD DO WAS OBSERVE THE DISTANT PEAKS 
OVER TIME IT BECAME CLEAR THAT ONE PEAK WAS HIGHER THAN THE REST 
IT WAS AN INDIAN 
RADHANATH SICKDHAR SORTING OUT THE VARIOUS SURVEY MEASUREMENTS ONE DAY ANNOUNCED 
SIR I HAVE DISCOVERED THE TALLEST MOUNTAIN IN THE WORLD THE SUMMIT WAS THEN KNOWN ONLY AS PEAK FIFTEEN 
ALTHOUGH DISCOVERED BY AN INDIAN PEAK FIFTEEN WAS CLAIMED BY THE BRITISH 
ANDREW WAUGH THE SURVEYOR GENERAL AT THE TIME NAMED IT AFTER HIS PREDECESSOR GEORGE EVEREST 
AND SO MOUNT EVEREST WAS BORN 
OFFICIAL BRITISH POLICY WAS THAT LOCAL NAMES WERE GIVEN TO MOUNTAINS 
OVER THE YEARS A NUMBER WERE TRIED FOR PEAK FIFTEEN BUT NONE WERE APPROVED 
ONE TIBETAN OPTION WAS MI THIK DGU THIK BYA PHUR LONG N. G. A. 
WHICH ROUGHLY TRANSLATES AS YOU CANNOT SEE THE SUMMIT FROM NEAR IT BUT YOU CAN FROM NINE DIRECTIONS 
AND A BIRD WHICH FLIES AS HIGH AS THE SUMMIT GOES BLIND 
UNSURPRISINGLY MOUNT EVEREST STUCK 
FOR ME THE GREAT ARC WAS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE RAMPANT IMPERIALISM OF NINETEENTH CENTURY BRITAIN 
SO WHY IS INDIA CELEBRATING IT NOW 
ARTISTS OF EVERY DISCIPLINE COME TO TAKE PART IN THE GREAT ARC FESTIVAL 
LOOK BACK TWO HUNDRED YEARS 
AT THE KIND OF MADNESS THAT GRIPPED PEOPLE EVEN TODAY TWO HUNDRED YEARS ON 
THE MEASUREMENTS THEY DID ARE ONLY OUT OF KILTER BY A FEW METRES 
ACROSS A MEASUREMENT OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED KILOMETRES THAT'S INCREDIBLE 
OTHERS AREN'T CONVINCED THAT THE GREAT ARC DESERVES COMMEMORATION 
ONE HAS TO BE AWARE THAT THIS IS A TOOL OF GOVERNMENT IT'S IMPERIALISM 
NO DIFFERENT FROM NAZI GERMANY CONQUERING BELGIUM 
IT'S ONE PEOPLE IMPOSING THEMSELVES ON ANOTHER PEOPLE AGAINST THEIR WILL 
THROUGH MONUMENTAL PROJECTS 
THE BRITISH TRIED TO MOULD INDIA IN THEIR IMAGE INDIA RESISTED LIKE SO MANY VICTORIAN ENTERPRISES 
THE GREAT ARC APPEARS TINGED WITH FOLLY SO MUCH EFFORT AND PAIN 
AND AT THE END WHAT A VERY LONG LINE 
BUT THE LAST LAUGH IS WITH LAMBTON AND EVEREST DESPITE THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR TASK THEY SUCCEEDED 
FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE THEY WERE INCH PERFECT
