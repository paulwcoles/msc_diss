YOU CAN WORK IT OUT IF YOU JUST LEARN ABOUT 
THE WAY THINGS WORK 
IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW IT CAN RIDE 
OR BUMP AND JUMP GLIDE AND SLIDE 
TAKE A LITTLE LOOK INSIDE THE WAY THINGS WORK 
AND WATCH THE THINGAMABOB THAT TURNS THE KNOB 
THAT MAKES THE JIGGER JIG 
THAT TURNS THE THINGAMAJIG THAT PULLS THE TRIGGER 
THAT MAKES THE DIGGER DIG 
IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW IT CAN FLY 
WITHOUT A WING OR STRING TO TIE WITH 
YOU FIND THE SAME RULES APPLY WITH 
THE WAY THINGS WORK 
OVER TIME SHIPS HAVE RUN AGROUND ON THE MAMMOTH ISLAND SANDBANKS 
THEY DUMPED CARGO OVERBOARD TO MAKE THEIR WAY BACK TO DEEP WATER 
OLIVE AND TROY SEE THE SANDBANKS AND MUD FLATS EXPOSED AT LOW TIDE 
AS A FANTASTIC SOURCE OF MATERIALS FOR THEIR PROJECTS 
PERSONALLY I GO THERE FOR THE BIRD WATCHING 
ARGH 
LOOK AT THIS WIRE TROY IS THIS FANTASTIC OR WHAT 
THESE TOOLS WE'VE HIT A GOLD MINE MORE LIKE AN IRON MINE COME HERE 
I HEARD THE CALL OF SOME EXOTIC SHORE BIRD 
RICH RICH WE'LL BE RICH RICH 
H. M. M. I'VE HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE 
WHAT ARE OUR DADS UP TO THIS TIME UM SIT BOY THAT'S IT 
GREAT LET'S HAVE THE BIG ONE 
FRANK AND PILBEAM APPEAR TO BE ON SOME SORT OF FISHING TRIP 
AND BY THE SIZE OF THE ROD THEY HAD A VERY LARGE CATCH IN MIND 
FISHING WITH MAGNETS 
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT FISH ARE RICH IN IRON BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS 
I DON'T GET IT I THINK OLIVE IS MAKING LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT IRON 
ALONG WITH STEEL WHICH IS MADE FROM IRON HAS MAGNETIC PROPERTIES 
ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN 
A MAGNET IS SURROUNDED BY AN INVISIBLE FORCE 
CALLED A MAGNETIC FIELD 
EVERY MAGNET HAS A NORTH AND A SOUTH POLE 
WHEN A MAGNET COMES TO MAGNETIC MATERIAL 
LIKE PILBEAM'S HORSESHOE MAGNET AND THAT IRON 
THE IRON IS MAGNETISED AND ATTRACTED TO THE MAGNET 
THEY STICK TOGETHER WITH A POWERFUL FORCE 
THEY'RE FISHING FOR SOMETHING MADE OF IRON 
BULL'S EYE YEY HEY WE DID IT 
NOW PULL MAMMOTH PULL 
LOOKS LIKE WE'VE DEFINITELY GOT SOMETHING 
OH OH 
RUN 
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE 
IT NEARLY GOT OUR DEAR OLD MAMMOTH 
THEIR NEXT JOB WAS TO TRY AND GET THEIR MAGNET OFF THE RAIL 
YEAH OH YEAH 
OW 
URGH FOUL ARGH YUCK 
THIS WAS MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOU MIGHT EXPECT 
THERE MUST BE A BETTER WAY ARE YOU ALL RIGHT THERE BOY 
FRANK AND PILBEAM DECIDED TO ADAPT THEIR SURPLUS HORSESHOE MAGNETS 
INTO STRAP ON MAMMOTH SHOES THEN THEY'D STICK TO STEEL AND NOT SLIP 
THIS I'M AFRAID PRODUCED THE OPPOSITE RESULT 
THE SHOES ON HIS HIND FEET STUCK FAST TOGETHER 
THE SHOES ON HIS FOREFEET PROPELLED AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER 
SEAGULLS CALL 
POOR MAMMOTH WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO HIM 
I'M AFRAID THE SHOES WERE AT FAULT 
ON A HORSESHOE MAGNET 
THE NORTH POLE'S ON ONE SIDE AND THE SOUTH ON THE OTHER 
WHEN TWO MAGNETS MEET THEY HAVE ONE OF TWO EFFECTS 
OPPOSITES ATTRACT SO NORTH POLES ATTRACT SOUTH POLES 
AND VICE VERSA CREATING IN THIS CASE A POWERFUL MAGNETIC BOND 
WHEREAS POLES OF THE SAME SORT REPEL EACH OTHER 
AND IN LOW FRICTION AREAS LIKE MUD FLATS SEND EACH OTHER FLYING 
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT MAMMOTH OH THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO 
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH THAT POOR MAMMOTH NEEDS OUR HELP AND SOON 
TROY AND OLIVE FINALLY DECIDED TO COME OUT OF THEIR HIDING PLACE 
OLIVE HELPED THE MAMMOTH OUT OF HIS SOAKING WET HARNESS 
AND TROY BUILT A CLOTHES DRYER FOR IT 
HE PROPPED UP A RAILWAY TRACK ONTO SOME OLD DRIFTWOOD 
AND TO KEEP THE CLOTHES OFF THE RUSTY RAIL 
HE WOUND WIRE AROUND IT IN A COIL THAT OUGHT TO DO IT 
TROY AND OLIVE WERE ABOUT TO HANG UP THE HARNESS 
WHEN SOMETHING REMARKABLE HAPPENED 
GNAARGHH WHOA 
ARGH MY BAG 
HEY WATCH OUT YOU 
H. M. M. 
WHAT HAPPENED TROY DID YOU THROW THAT METAL JUNK AT ME ON PURPOSE 
IT WEREN'T ME THEY FLEW OUT ON THEIR OWN 
AND DID THEY END UP IT WAS WHEN THE LIGHTNING STRUCK 
IT ALL FLEW AT THIS IRON BAR AS IF IT WAS A POWERFUL MAGNET BUT LOOK 
NOTHING SO WHAT HAPPENED LOOKS LIKE YOU MADE AN ELECTROMAGNET 
PARDON ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN 
THE MAJOR PART OF THE ELECTROMAGNET IS THE COILED WIRE 
WHEN AN ELECTRIC CURRENT FLOWS THROUGH THE WIRE 
IT CREATES A MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND IT 
BUT WHEN THAT WEAK MAGNETIC FIELD IS MULTIPLIED 
BY THE HIGH NUMBER OF TURNS IN THE COIL 
A VERY STRONG MAGNETIC FIELD IS CREATED 
THE IRON BAR IN THE MIDDLE HELPS TO CONCENTRATE THE FIELD 
WHEN THE CURRENT FLOWS THE BAR DEVELOPS OPPOSITE POLES 
AT EITHER END WHICH ATTRACT IRON AND STEEL OBJECTS 
FRANK AND PILBEAM WERE SO PLEASED AT THE INVENTION OF A MAGNET 
THEY COULD ACTUALLY SWITCH ON AND OFF 
THEY BROUGHT DOWN A CABLE TO POWER ONE OF THEIR OWN 
BUT IT WAS HEAVIER THAN THE HORSESHOE MAGNET 
ARGH OOF 
THIS ISN'T REALLY WORKING IS IT PILBEAM 
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT DAD NEVER BETTER 
COOL 
NOT ONLY IS IT COOL 
IT MIGHT EVEN BE USEFUL HOW DO YOU MEAN 
WELL SURELY WE CAN MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF THOSE SPINNING MAGNETS 
LIKE POWERING A MACHINE MAYBE 
OF COURSE 
OLIVE HAD HAPPENED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE ELECTRIC MOTOR 
ELECTRIC MOTORS RUN EITHER ON DIRECT CURRENT D. C. FROM A BATTERY 
OR ALTERNATING CURRENT FROM MAINS ELECTRICITY 
THE A. C. MOTOR IS THE SIMPLEST TO UNDERSTAND 
AN ALTERNATING CURRENT FLOWS THIS WAY AND THAT IN RAPID SUCCESSION 
WHEN THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY CHANGES DIRECTION 
THE POLES OF THE MAGNET SWAP POSITIONS 
THE ELECTROMAGNET TURNS TO FACE THE OTHER WAY AGAIN AND AGAIN 
BY HOOKING UP GEARS AND BEDS TO THE SPINNING AXLE 
THE MOTOR CAN DO SOME VERY HARD WORK 
ONE BY ONE THE LENGTHS OF RAILWAY TRACK 
WERE LIFTED FROM THE BARGE BY TROY'S ELECTROMAGNET 
THEY WERE LIFTED AND TRANSPORTED BY A CRANE MECHANISM 
THAT HAD OLIVE'S NEW ELECTRIC MOTOR AT ITS HEART 
BEFORE TOO LONG A GREAT PILE OF TRACK HAD BEEN SALVAGED 
O. K. THAT'S THEM ALL HURRAY WE'LL BE FAMOUS 
AND RICH RICH AND FAMOUS HOW COME 
WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A NEW SORT OF RAILWAY 
AND WHAT'S GOING TO BE SO DIFFERENT ABOUT IT WELL 
UM WELL DUNNO 
UM I'VE THOUGHT OF SOME GREAT UNIFORMS 
I SEE 
HEY MAYBE THOSE ELECTROMAGNETS AND ELECTRIC MOTORS 
COULD POWER A NEW SORT OF TRAIN 
IF YOU USE THE MAGNETS TO REPEL EACH OTHER 
AND PUT THEM ON THE TRAIN YOU WOULDN'T NEED WHEELS 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA 
WHAT OLIVE THOUGHT OF IS CALLED MAGNETIC LEVITATION 
A MAGLEV TRAIN AS IT'S KNOWN 
USES POWERFUL ELECTROMAGNETS TO RAISE ITSELF ABOVE THE TRACK 
FREED FROM FRICTION OUR TRAIN CAN FLOAT ALONG SMOOTHLY AND QUIETLY 
IT'S PROPELLED FORWARD BY MAGNETISM AS WELL 
THE COILS ON THE TRAIN GENERATE A MAGNETIC FIELD 
IN WHICH THE POLES SHIFT ALONG THE TRAIN 
ELECTRIC CURRENTS FLOW IN THE RAIL BELOW AND IT MAKES ITS OWN FIELD 
THE MAGNETIC FORCE BETWEEN THE TWO FIELDS 
PULLS THE FLOATING TRAIN ALONG THE TRACK 
THE TRAIN IS NOW BOARDING PLEASE HAVE YOUR TICKETS READY 
HELLO FRANK NICE UNIFORM GLAD TO SEE YOUR RAILWAY'S SUCH A SUCCESS 
WELL THE THINGS YOU AND THE KIDS DID WITH THE MAGNETS REALLY HELPED 
I TELL YOU WHAT I'LL LET YOU ALL RIDE FOR 
HOW ABOUT TEN PER CENT REDUCTION ON OUR STANDARD FARE 
HOW ABOUT FREE FREE WHAT ALL RIGHT THEN 
ALL ABOARD 
SO HOW DOES IT FEEL 
NOW THAT YOUR FATHERS ARE IN THE RAILWAY BUSINESS 
GREAT THE STATIONS ARE SO CONVENIENT 
BUT I DON'T THINK YOUR MOTHER SEES IT THAT WAY DOES SHE TROY UM 
NEXT STOP PILBEAM STATION LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
PILBEAM STATION 
PILBEAM GET THESE PEOPLE OUT OF MY BATHROOM 
ARGH HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO HAVE MY BATH 
WHEN YOU TURN MY HOUSE INTO GRAND CENTRAL STATION I'VE HAD ENOUGH
