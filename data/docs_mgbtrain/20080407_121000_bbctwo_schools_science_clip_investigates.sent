OH AH 
AGH 
WHEE 
EVERYONE LOVES TALKING TO BABIES 
BUT DO WE KNOW IF THEY CAN HEAR US 
OOH HELLO 
CHRIS IS A HEALTH VISITOR 
SHE CHECKS BABIES TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE HEALTHY AND GROWING WELL 
SHE FINDS OUT IF YOUNG BABIES CAN HEAR 
YOU'VE BROUGHT HIM FOR THE HEARING TEST TODAY COME WITH ME 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT WHETHER BABIES CAN HEAR 
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SPEAK TO US 
AND LET US KNOW 
IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE 
DEVELOP SKILLS OF LANGUAGE AND SPEECH 
AND THEREFORE IF THEY CANNOT HEAR 
WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE TREATMENT 
SOMETIMES WE CAN DETECT SIMPLE CONDITIONS SUCH AS GLUE EAR 
AND THIS COULD BE SIMPLY TREATED 
OR THEY MAY NEED A HEARING AID 
AND ALSO THE MUMS CAN LEARN SIGN LANGUAGE 
HELLO MELISSA 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THOSE BRICKS NOW 
THE IMPORTANT FEATURES OF ANY TEST DONE ON BABIES' 
ARE TO DO IT ROUGHLY AT THE SAME AGE 
FOR A GROUP OF CHILDREN 
THE TEST MUST BE EASY AND SIMPLE TO ADMINISTER 
SHE'S MORE INTERESTED IN THE LIGHTS 
IT SHOULD BE CHEAP AS WELL AND SHOULDN'T HAVE PAIN OR DISCOMFORT 
AH IN THE MOUTH 
THAT'S THE NORMAL REACTION 
TO TEST BABIES' HEARING 
CHRIS USES SOMETHING CALLED THE DISTRACTION TEST 
SHE GETS THE BABY TO FOCUS ON A TOY THEN DISTRACTS HIM 
WITH A NOISE BEHIND HIS BACK 
EXCELLENT 
IF THE BABY TURNS ITS HEAD TO THE NOISE 
WE CAN BE FAIRLY CERTAIN THAT THE BABY CAN HEAR 
HAS BABY HAD COLDS AND COUGHS 
YEAH AND NOW SHE'S HAVING A BIT OF A COUGH A BIT OF A RUNNY NOSE 
THE TESTS DON'T ALWAYS WORK 
BECAUSE CHILDREN SOMETIMES ARE SHY 
AND THEREFORE DON'T RESPOND TO THE TESTS 
OR THEY'RE NOT CURIOUS ENOUGH 
TO WANT TO LOOK AROUND 
IT'S NOT EASY TO WORK WITH BABIES 
BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY UNPREDICTABLE 
SO YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM TIME 
COAX THEM AND BE VERY FRIENDLY AND RELAXED 
AND WORK WITHIN THEIR OWN SPEED 
THE TEST CAN'T BE CARRIED OUT ON BABIES YOUNGER THAN EIGHT MONTHS 
NEW BORN BABIES TEND TO BE WITHDRAWN 
AND DON'T REACT MUCH TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD 
THERE COULD BE LOTS OF REASONS WHY DURING THE TEST 
BABY DOESN'T MOVE HER HEAD WHICH HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HER HEARING 
SO CHRIS ALSO TALKS TO THE PARENTS 
ANY FAMILY HISTORY OF DEAFNESS 
NO 
O. K. AND YOU'RE NOT WORRIED 
IF THE TEST SHOWS THAT THE CHILD CANNOT HEAR 
AND MUM IS ALSO CONCERNED 
WE REFER THE CHILD TO THE AUDIO CLINIC IN THE LOCAL AREA 
WHERE THEY WILL CARRY OUT FURTHER AND MORE DETAILED TESTING 
WHAT'S THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS MAN AND THESE DINOSAURS 
BECAUSE DINOSAURS DON'T EXIST TODAY WE CAN'T FILM THEM 
SO WE HAVE TO CREATE THEM ON A COMPUTER IT'S CALLED AN ANIMATION 
WHEN ANIMATIONS ARE MADE NOT JUST THE PICTURE HAS TO BE CREATED 
MY JOB IS TO CREATE SOUND ANIMALS MAKE IN ANIMATION 
FOR EXAMPLE I WORKED ON THE TRUTH ABOUT KILLER DINOSAURS 
SOUND IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WITHOUT IT PICTURES WOULDN'T SEEM REAL 
I GET THE PICTURE WITHOUT SOUND 
AND I HAVE TO THINK OF WAYS OF MAKING THAT SOUND UP 
IF AN ANIMAL IS DRINKING AT A RIVER I HAVE TO THINK OF A WATERY NOISE 
THAT CAN MATCH THOSE PICTURES 
IF A DINOSAUR IS EATING ANOTHER DINOSAUR 
I AM THINKING OF WAYS OF HOW TO MAKE THAT DINOSAUR 
SOUND AS IF IT'S EATING A BONE 
FOR INSTANCE I MIGHT USE A CABBAGE 
OR A PIECE OF WOOD THAT BREAKS OR EVEN A PIECE OF CELERY 
JUST TO CREATE THE IMPRESSION THAT THAT BONE IS BREAKING 
THEN I CHECK IT AGAINST THE PICTURE TO SEE IF IT SOUNDS LIKE IT SHOULD 
WE USE THINGS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO WHAT THE ANIMALS ARE DOING 
AND SOMETIMES WE USE THINGS THAT ARE SO DIFFERENT 
AN ANIMAL COULD EAT A PLANT I MAY USE A VIDEOTAPE TO CREATE THAT SOUND 
WHAT'S JOVAN DOING NOW 
THE SOUND OF A SMALL DINOSAUR RUNNING AWAY 
BUT SOME DINOS ARE VERY BIG 
AND THEIR FOOTSTEPS NEED TO SOUND VERY HEAVY 
SO HOW DID JOVAN MAKE THAT SOUND 
BANGING A BIG LOG ON SOME EARTH WILL MAKE A HEAVY SOUND 
BUT THIS DINOSAUR ALSO HAS SCRATCHY CLAWS 
SO JOVAN BANGED THE LOG ON GRAVEL TO CREATE A SCRATCHY SOUND 
BUT NOW THIS DINOSAUR'S WALKING ON SNOW 
TO CREATE THE SOUND OF AN ANIMAL WALKING ON SNOW 
I WILL GET SOME SALT AND PUT IT IN A POUCH 
AND THEN I WILL CRUSH AND GRIND THAT SALT TOGETHER 
AND THAT WILL GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF AN ANIMAL WALKING ON SNOW 
LISTEN AGAIN DOES IT SOUND RIGHT 
WHEN SOMEBODY WALKS AWAY FROM YOU IN REAL LIFE 
THEIR FOOTSTEPS GET QUIETER 
SO TO DO THIS I BRING THE VOLUME FURTHER AND FURTHER DOWN 
AND THIS WILL GIVE THE SOUND OF A DINOSAUR WALKING AWAY FROM YOU 
SO NEXT TIME YOU SEE AN ANIMATION 
REMEMBER THE REAL STAR 
MM M. M. 
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN TO DO JOVAN'S JOB 
HAVE A GO AT MAKING SOME SOUND EFFECTS FOR THIS SEQUENCE
