EXPLOSION AT AL HOUSE IN BRISTOL THIRTY 
PEOPLE HAD TO BE MOVED OUT OF THEIR 
NEARBY HOMES POLICE SAY THEY WERE 
ACTING ON INTELLIGENCE 
WE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO REASSURE 
PEOPLE THAT THIS ARREST HAS BEEN 
MADE AT THIS STAGE TO PREVENT HARM 
OVERSTRETCHED ONE OF BRITAIN'S 
BIGGEST BANKS LOOKS TO SHAREHOLDERS 
TO RAISE MONEY 
DOWN WITH THE BRITISH DOWN WITH 
THE THIEVES ROBERT MUGABE ATTACKS 
THE U. K. IN A SPEECH MARKING 
ZIMBABWEAN INDEPENDENCE 
ON B. B. C. LONDON MORE JOB LOSSES 
EXPECTED IN THE CITY AS THE WORLD'S 
LARGEST BANK ANNOUNCES HUGE LOSSES 
AND FACING A CRISIS IN CARE 
THALIDOMIDE VICTIMS FIFTY YEARS ON 
HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON A CONTROLLED 
EXPLOSION HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT AT A 
HOUSE IN BRISTOL AFTER A MAN WAS 
ARRESTED UNDER THE TERRORISM ACT 
ABOUT THIRTY PEOPLE IN THE WESTBURY ON 
TRYM AREA OF THE CITY HAD TO BE 
MOVED OUT OF THEIR HOMES SOME HAVE 
STILL NOT BEEN ABLE TO RETURN THE 
NINETEEN YEAR OLD BAN IT IS BEING 
QUESTIONED BY POLICE WE CAN GET 
THE LATEST FROM OUR HOME AFFAIRS 
CORRESPONDENT DANIEL SANDFORD HE 
IS AT THE SCENE WHAT A PLEA 
SAYING 
THE HOUSE CONCERNED IS THE SAYING SECOND HOUSE IN THIS ROW HERE JUST 
BEHIND THE DOOR THAT YOU CAN SEE 
THE NINETEEN YEAR OLD MAN ACCORDING TO 
NEIGHBOURS MOVED INTO THE AREA 
ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AGO HE WAS FAIRLY 
INCONSPICUOUS DIDN'T SEEM TO COME 
AND GO FROM HIS HOUSE PARTICULARLY 
IF ANYTHING HE STOOD OUT BECAUSE 
HE DID NOT LEAVE HIS HOUSE MUCH 
THEY HAD CAUSE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT 
LOUD MUSIC HE WAS PLAYING ISLAMIC 
CHANTING THAT HE PLAYED DURING THE 
NIGHT APART FROM THAT THEY 
HAVEN'T MUCH TO DO WITH HIM THEY 
DESCRIBED HIM AS WHITE OR 
MEDITERRANEAN LOOKING WEARING A 
LONG WHITE ROBE BEFORE MIDNIGHT 
THEY WERE TOLD THEY HAD TO EVACUATE 
THIS AREA SOME THIRTY PEOPLE ALL FROM THIS LITTLE DEVELOPMENT JUST DOWN 
HERE THEY WERE MOVED FIRST OF ALL 
TO A SCHOOL AND THEN TO A HOTEL AT 
ABOUT TWO A M. THIS MORNING A CONTROLLED 
EXPLOSION WAS CARRIED OUT I 
UNDERSTAND IT WAS JUST OUTSIDE THE 
HOUSE AND NOT ACTUALLY INSIDE THE 
HOUSE AT THE MOMENT THERE IS 
FORENSIC ANALYSIS GOING ON TO WORK 
OUT WHAT THERE WAS INSIDE THE HOUSE 
THE REASON FOR THE REST I 
UNDERSTAND WAS FROM INTELLIGENCE 
RECEIVED QUITE LATE ON JUST IN THE 
LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS ARREST IT IS NOT 
CLEAR WHAT THE INTELLIGENCE WAS L. L. 
GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THE 
OPERATION IS IN ITS EARLY DAYS AT 
THE MOMENT IT IS UNCLEAR IF THIS 
MAN HAS CONNECTIONS ELSEWHERE IT 
IS UNCLEAR WHAT IT IS THAT HE MIGHT 
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN IF ANYTHING 
AT ALL THE JOB THAT IS GOING ON 
NOW IS TO TRY AND WORK OUT WHERE HE 
FITS INTO A BIGGER PICTURE QUITE 
OFTEN IN THESE OPERATIONS WHICH 
HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE IN THIS CASE 
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE 
INFORMATION AND THE WAY IT WAS 
RECEIVED THEY HAVE TO DO THAT 
AFTER HIS ARREST 
YOU HAVE SOME 
SENSE FROM POLICE THAT THIS IS AN 
OPERATION THAT HAS A WAY TO RUN 
YET 
I THINK IT CERTAINLY DOES HAVE YET A WAY TO RUN L. THINK THE TRUTH IS 
THAT NOBODY QUITE KNOWS WHAT THEY 
HAVE GOT AT THE MOMENT L. THINK 
THERE IS STILL A POSSIBILITY THAT 
THIS WILL TURN INTO A NOT VERY 
SIGNIFICANT INCIDENT THAT SAID 
CLEARLY THERE ARE SOME SAFETY 
CONCERNS THERE WAS SAFETY CONCERNS 
LAST NIGHT AND THERE IS A MAN IN 
CUSTODY THERE IS WORK GOING ON NOW 
TO WORK OUT EXACTLY WHERE HE FITS 
IN CLEARLY THERE WAS SOME STRANGE 
BEHAVIOUR LOUD MUSIC BEING PLAYED 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THERE 
WERE CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT WAS FOUND 
AT THE HOUSE L. THINK THE STORY IS 
NOT GOING TO RESOLVE ITSELF VERY 
QUICKLY QUICKLY A MAN WHO WENT ON THE RUN SHORTLY 
BEFORE HE WAS FOUND GUILTY OF FUND 
RAISING FOR TERRORISM HAS HANDED 
HIMSELF IN SHAH JALAL HUSSAIN WAS 
CONVICTED YESTERDAY ALONGSIDE ABBA 
IS DIZZYING ABU IZZADEEN BOTH 
MEN ARE DUE TO BE SENTENCED AT 
KINGSTON CROWN COURT 
BRITAIN'S SECOND LARGEST BANK IS TO 
ASK SHAREHOLDERS TO HELP IT RAISE 
MUCH NEEDED MONEY THE ROYAL BANK 
OF SCOTLAND WANTS TEN BILLION 
BECAUSE OF THE LOSSES IT HAS 
SUFFERED FROM THE SLUMP IN THE U. S. 
HOUSING MARKET 
ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND IS MAJOR 
PLAYER ON THE INTERNATIONAL BANKING 
STAGE THE QUESTION BEING ASKED 
TODAY HAS IT OVERSTRETCHED ITSELF 
AND IS IT NOW PAYING THE PRICE RBS 
HAS BEEN ON A BUILDING SPREE 
STARTING WITH NATWEST AND THEN 
LAST YEAR HEADING GROUP THAT 
CARRIED OUT EUROPE'S BIGGEST EVER 
ANTI TAKEOVER OF A. B. N. AMRO IN THE 
WAKE OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH THAT 
DOES NOT LOOK QUITE SO CLEVER YOU YOU CANNOT DIGEST IT IN SUCH A SHORT 
SPACE OF TIME AND DELIVER 
SHAREHOLDER VALUE WHEN YOU GET HIT 
IN THE FACE BY A CREDIT CRISIS THAT 
IS NOT IN YOU'RE MAKING THE THE HOUSING SLUMP IN THE U. S. IS THE 
CAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS FOR RBS AND 
OTHER BANKS THEY HAVE RUN UP 
LOSSES BECAUSE OF INVESTMENTS MADE 
LINKED TO THE MORTGAGE MARKET WHAT 
IS THE RIGHTS ISSUE 
IN EFFECT IT IS GOING CAP IN HAND 
TO SHAREHOLDERS GIVING THEM THE 
RIGHT TO BUY SHARES AT BELOW MARKET 
PRICE NO COMPANY LIKES TO DO THAT 
BUT THEY HAVE LITTLE CHOICE 
IT IS THE FIRST BRITISH BANK TO 
CARRY OUT THIS TYPE OF EXERCISE IN 
THE WAKE OF THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY 
THE U. S. HOUSING MARKET SLUMP IT IS 
UNLIKELY TO BE THE LAST OTHER 
MAJOR BANKS ARE CONSIDERING GOING 
TO SHAREHOLDERS TO RAISE FUNDS TO 
BOLSTER THEIR BALANCE SHEETS 
IF WE 
ARE GOING TO BE ASKING SHAREHOLDERS 
TO STUMP UP FOR ONE BANK AFTER 
ANOTHER WE MIGHT START TO SEE A 
STAMPEDE OF BANKS RACING TO GET 
THERE EARLY AND NOT BE THE LAST ONE 
AND NONE OF THAT WILL MAKE IT ANY 
EASIER TO BORROW MONEY FROM THE 
BANKS AS THEY LOOKED TO SHORE UP 
THEIR FINANCES THEY WILL BE IN NO 
MOOD TO BE GENEROUS WITH MORTGAGE 
LENDING ON TUESDAY BANK CHIEFS 
WENT TO TEN DOWNING STREET TO 
DISCUSS HOW TO RELIEVE THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH INCLUDING FRED GOODWIN IT 
IS BELIEVED THE PRIME MINISTER 
AGREED TO DO HIS BIT AS LONG AS 
THE BANKS DID THEIRS 
OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR STEPHANIE 
FLANDERS IS WITH ME IT IS GOOD 
NEWS FOR SOME 
YES BUT IT SOUNDS 
STRANGE TO SAY THAT WE HAVE ALL 
THESE WEEKS WHERE WE TALK ABOUT THE 
GOVERNMENT THINKING OF NEW WAYS TO 
HELP OUT THE BANKS AND IMPROVE THE 
CASH FLOW BETWEEN EACH OTHER TO 
HELP THEM LEND MORE TO WAS IN 
MORTGAGES WHAT THE BANK HAS BEEN 
SAYING AT THE SAME TIME IS WE 
WILL DO OUR PART BUT YOU HAVE GOT 
TO DO YOUR BITS YOU HAVE TO COME 
CLEAN ON ALL OF THE LOSSES HE MADE 
ON INVESTMENTS AND GO TO 
SHAREHOLDERS AS THEM TO STAND UP 
TO THE PLIGHT AS WELL IT IS GOING 
TO BE DICEY FOR THE ROYAL BANK OF 
SCOTLAND BECAUSE THEY SWORE THEY 
WERE NOT GOING TO DO THIS FOR THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH AS A WHOLE IT COULD 
BE GOOD 
COULD IT MEAN THAT OTHER 
BANKS MIGHT FOLLOW THEIR LEAD I'M I'M NOT SURE OF A STAMPEDE BUT IT IS A 
BIT LIKE THE STAGES OF GRIEF 
MOVING FROM DENIAL TO ACCEPTANCE 
AT THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND HAS 
TAKEN THAT BANK STAFF IT IS VERY 
HARD FOR BRITISH BANKS TO DO THAT 
BRITISH BANKS HAVE BEEN VERY SCARED 
OF BEING FIRST NOW THERE WILL BE 
PLENTY SAY THANK GOODNESS WE CAN 
GO NOW 
LET ME JUST TELL YOU YOU CAN FIND 
OUT MORE ABOUT THAT STORY GENERALLY 
IF YOU LOOK AT OUR BUSINESS

LABOUR M. P. GWYNETH DUNWOODY WHO 
DIED LAST NIGHT AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY SEVEN 
SHE WAS THIS COUNTRY'S LONGER 
SERVING FEMALE M. P. AND A HUGELY 
RESPECTED CHAIR OF THE TRANSPORT 
SELECT COMMITTEE THE PRIME 
MINISTER DESCRIBED HER AS POLITICS 
AT ITS BEST AND SAID SHE WOULD BE 
SADLY MISSED 
I LONG AGO GAVE UP EXPECTING 
ANSWERS FROM GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS 
BUT I DO OCCASIONALLY LIKE TO SEE 
THE QUESTIONS 
GRILLING A TRANSPORT 
SECTOR SECRETARY WITH A WITHERING 
BLUNT FORENSIC WIT THIS IS HOW 
SHE WILL PROBABLY BE BEST 
REMEMBERED A SELF DESCRIBED BUT 
LACKS HER CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE 
TRANSPORT SELECT COMMITTEE WON HER 
ADMIRERS ACROSS THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS AN 
HOUR ENAMOURED SHE WAS LABOUR TO 
THE CORE HER WELSH FATHER WAS THE 
POWERFUL GENERAL SECRETARY WHILE 
HER MOTHER WAS A MINISTER IN THE 
HOUSE OF LORDS 
GWYNETH DUNWOODY IS 
ELECTED MEMBER 
AFTER ENTERING 
PARLIAMENT IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX SHE BECAME A 
JUNIOR MINISTER THE GREASY POLE OF 
A MINISTERIAL PROMOTION WAS NOT FOR 
HER IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR SHE BECAME MINISTER

FIERCELY INDEPENDENT SHE WAS 
POLITICS AT ITS BEST A GREAT 
PARLIAMENTARIAN A GREAT EXPERT ON

MAVERICK IS AN 
OVER USED WORD IN POLITICS BUT 
GWYNETH DUNWOODY WAS ONE WHEN M. P.'S 
RETURN TO THE COMMONS THEY WILL 
FIND IT MISSING ONE OF ITS MOST 
COLOURFUL MEMBERS 
GWYNETH DUNWOODY WHO DIED AT THE 
AGE OF SEVENTY SEVEN 
A REMINDER OF OUR TOP STORY A NINETEEN 
YEAR OLD MAN IS BEING QUESTIONED 
UNDER THE TERRORISM ACT AFTER A 
CONTROLLED EXPLOSION WAS CARRIED 
OUT AT A HOUSE IN BRISTOL THIRTY 
PEOPLE HAD TO BE MOVED OUT OF THEIR 
HOMES HOMES COMING UP CRICKET GETS THE 
BOLLYWOOD TREATMENT AS INDIA 
LAUNCHES A NEW SUPER LEAGUE 
LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON BRINGING THE 
BAHT TO THE BARGAIN ISLES THE 
SHAKESPEARE PLAYS COMING TO A 
SUPERMARKET NEAR YOU AND CHELSEA 
ARE STILL IN THE TITLE RACE BUT 
THEIR MANAGER SEEMS RELUCTANT TO 
ADMIT IT 
SO IT WILL HAVE AMERICAN STYLE 
CHEERLEADERS SOME OF THE BIGGEST 
NAMES IN THE GAME AND A LOT OF 
MONEY BACKING IT BUT IS IT 
CRICKET THIS AFTERNOON THE INDIAN 
PREMIER LEAGUE GETS UNDER WAY WITH 
EIGHT TEAMS BATTLING IT OUT THE 
TOURNAMENT BEGINS IN BANGALORE 
DAMIAN GRAMMATICAS IS THERE TO 
EXPLAIN WHAT IT COULD MEAN FOR THE 
FUTURE OF THE GAME 
FINAL PREPARATIONS ARE UNDER WAY 
FOR THE LAUNCH OF THE INDIAN 
PREMIER LEAGUE WELCOME TO 
BANGALORE WHERE THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
KICKS OFF TODAY THIS IS GOING TO 
BE THE RICHEST TOURNAMENT EVER IN 
CRICKET IT HAS THE POWER TO 
RESHAPE THE GLOBAL GAME YOU CAN 
SEE WHERE THE MONEY IS COMING FROM 
THE SPONSORSHIP AND ADVERTISERS 
LOGO HAS ARE BEING PAINTED ONTO THE 
PITCH THEY HAVE PAID ONE BILLION DOLLARS 
JUST FOR THE TELEVISION RIGHTS THE 
OPENING GAME WILL PIT BANGALORE A 
TEAM BACKED BY ONE OF THE MOST 
FLAMBOYANT FIGURES IN INDIAN 
BUSINESS AGAINST CALCUTTA THAT IS 
BACKED BY ONE OF THE BIGGEST NAMES 
IN BOLLYWOOD MOVIES THIS IS 
TYPICAL OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
PUTTING THEIR MONEY INTO THE INDIAN 
PREMIER LEAGUE WHAT IT MEANS IS 
THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO BUY IN THE 
BEST PLAYERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD 
PEOPLE LIKE GLENN MAGUIRE THE 
HIGHEST PAID PLAYERS ARE EARNING IN 
EXCESS OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND A WEEK IT MEANS 
OF CRICKETERS EARNING SALARIES THAT 
FOOTBALLERS HAVE DREAMED OF IT 
MEANS THAT IT COULD RESHAPE CRICKET 
THE TRADITIONAL FIVE DAY GAMES TO 
THE T. W. E. N. T. Y. TWENTY VERSION ENGLISH 
PLAYERS WANT TO COME HERE THEY ARE 
BEING PREVENTED FROM DOING SO BY 
THEIR CONTRACTS IN THE U. K. ALL OF 
THIS IS REALLY A HUGE GAMBLE IT IS 
GENERATING A HUGE BUZZ 
NOW WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE 
LATEST EFFECT OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
ON THE WORLD OF BANKING BUT HIS IS 
ALSO HAVING A BIG IMPACT ON OUR 
COUNTRYSIDE THE PRICE OF FARMLAND 
IS WISING AT ITS FASTEST RATE FOR 
MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS MAC IT IS 
ALSO DOCTRINE HAS BEEN CAUSED BOND 
AND IS IN OXFORDSHIRE 
POOR'S CUP A VERY BEAUTIFUL RURAL 
OXFORDSHIRE AND IN PLACES LIKE 
THIS THEY HAVE ALWAYS REGARDED 
INVESTMENT IN ENGLAND AS BEING GOOD 
AND STURDY AND SOLID BUT THAT HAS 
ALL CHANGED IT HAS NOW BECOME MUCH 
MORE SPECTACULAR AND IN SOME 
PLACES IT HAS DOUBLED IN PRICE 
THIS FARM IN OXFORDSHIRE IS ON THE 
MARKET AND IT IS ATTRACTING BIG 
MONEY THE HOUSE OFFERS A HUGELY 
ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO LIVE AND THERE 
ARE FOUR HUNDRED ACRES OF LAND WHICH HELPED 
TO MAKE ALL THIS WORTH MILLIONS A 
SHORT TIME AGO AGRICULTURAL LAND 
WAS SELLING FOR UP TO THREE DOZEN 
FIVE HUNDRED PER ACRE TODAY IT IS UP TO 
EIGHT THOUSAND EVERYBODY IT SEEMS WANTS 
A SLICE OF RURAL BRITAIN 
WE HAVE 
GOT A LOT OF LOCAL FAMILY FARMERS 
INTERESTED IN THIS FORM ALSO CITY 
INDIVIDUALS EARNING BONUSES 
LOOKING FOR A STYLE PRODUCES 
AND THE IRISH AND THE DANES ARE 
ALSO LOOKING SO WE HAVE GOT A 
VERY WIDE AUDIENCE WERE ALL BIDDING 
FOR THIS FROM 
GERSHWIN FOR THIS FARM IN SOME 
PLACES IT LOOKS AS THOUGH YOU NEED 
WILL STAR MONEY TO GET IN ON TO 
THIS MARKET 
WE HAVE HAD THREE KIDS 
THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE ON THE WAY 
ALEX HAS MADE HIS FAMILY HOME ON AN 
OXFORD SUE FOREIGN NOT AS AN 
INVESTMENT BUT AS A LIFESTYLE 
CHOSE HE KNOWS THAT THE HUGE 
INCREASE IN FOOD PRICES IS PUSHING 
THE VALUE OF LAND UP BUT THERE ARE 
OTHER FACTORS TOO 
LAND IS FREE OF 
INHERITANCE TAX SO WEALTHY PEOPLE 
ARE BUYING LAND BECAUSE THERE CAN 
BE SICKLY TRANSFER THEIR ASSETS TO 
THEIR BENEFICIARIES TAX FREE 
THERE IS ALSO BIG ELEMENT OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND 
I SUPPOSE THIS ALL AMPLIFIES WHAT 
MARK TWAIN SAID MAC BORROWED LAND 
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MAKING THE 
MONEY WILL 
SUGGEST THAT HOME MONITORING KITS 
HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON CONTROLLING 
GLUCOSE LEVELS FOR PEOPLE WHO DO 
NOT NEED INSULIN BUT IT COULD LEAD 
TO THOUSANDS OF DIABETICS FEELING 
ANXIOUS OR DEPRESSED THIS MAN WAS 
DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES HE HAS 
CHANGED HIS LIFESTYLE OF THE 
HE BELIEVES HE NEEDS TO KEEP 
TESTING HIS BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS IF IF I CHECKED MYSELF AFTER TWO HOURS OF 
EATING I KNOW WHAT MY BLOOD SUGAR 
IS IF IT IS NOT GOOD I CAN 
ACTUALLY GO BACK TO THE DOCTORS AND 
SAY MY BLOOD SUGAR IS HIGH DO I 
NEED TO CHANGE MY MEDICATION NOR DO 
I NEED TO GO AND EXERCISE MORE BE 
MORE ACTIVE 
TODAY'S STUDIES 
QUESTION HOW EFFECTIVE THESE TESTS 
ARE THEY SAY THEY COST THE N. H. S. 
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MILLION EVERY YEAR 
YET THEY HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT 
ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS THEY CAN 
CAUSE DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY THE 
AUTHORS SAY THE MONEY COULD BE 
BETTER SPENT HELPING PEOPLE 
EXERCISE MORE AND CHANGE THEIR 
LIFESTYLES BUT IT IS A 
CONTROVERSIAL ARGUMENT 
WE KNOW 
WITH DIABETES IF IT IS NOT SELF 
MANAGED AND IT IS NOT APPROPRIATELY 
MONITORED THEN IT CAN LEAD TO 
COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS HEART DISEASE 
AND STROKES THAT CAN ACTUALLY 
INCREASE THE COST IN THE LONG TERM 
FOR THE N. H. S. 
ABOUT ONE IN TWENTY FIVE OF US 
HAVE DIABETES WHETHER BLOOD SUGAR 
MONITORING HELPS MAKE IN THE END 
BE AN INDIVIDUAL CHOICE 
MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND COUNCIL SEATS ARE 
UP FOR GRABS IN THE LOCAL ELECTIONS 
ON MAY FIRST THE ENVIRONMENT IS 
PROVING A KEY BATTLEGROUND A NEW 
SURVEY SHOWS THAT MORE THAN SIX OUT 
OF TEN VOTERS WOULD BE MORE LIKELY 
TO VOTE FOR CANDIDATES WITH THE 
RIGHT GREEN CREDENTIALS OUR 
CORRESPONDENT REPORTS 
PURPLE IS THE NEW BLACK AT LEAST 
WHEN IT COMES TO BIN BAGS THE CAN 
THE CONSERVATIVE DOMINATED 
COUNCIL IN THIS HERTFORDSHIRE TOWN 
GIVES DIFFERENT COLOURED BIN BAGS 
THIS LADY IS A FIRM SUPPORTER OF 
THE CHARGE PARTICULARLY IF IT 
MAKES PEOPLE RECYCLE MORE 
A WE HAVE GOT TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT 
OF WASTE THAT IS THROWN OUT 
ANYTHING THAT WILL STOP PEOPLE 
PUTTING OUT SO MANY SACKS AND MAKE 
THEM RECYCLE MORE HAS GOT TO BE A 
GOOD THING 
THE COUNCIL SAYS RECYCLING RATES 
HAVE GONE UP BY SEVENTY PER CENT IN ONE AREA OF 
THE TOWN HOWEVER WITH THE 
CONSERVATIVES HOLDING THIRTY SIX OUT OF THIRTY EIGHT 
SEATS ON THE COUNCIL THE POLITICAL 
RISKS OF INTRODUCING THE CHARGE 
HAVE BEEN MINIMAL 
WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY MONEY TO 
SUPPOSE OF THE RUBBISH THAT WE 
COLLECT SO IF IT CAN BE RECYCLED 
THEN THAT IS ALL TO THE GOOD THIS THIS LADY HAS TWO SMALL CHILDREN JACK 
AND HARRY BOTH BOYS STILL USED 
NAPPIES AND SHE SAYS THAT MEANS 
TWO PURPLE SACKS OF RUBBISH PER 
WEEK COSTING HER AN EXTRA FIFTEEN PER 
YEAR ON COUNCIL TAX 
I JUST THINK 
IT IS EXTORTION IT IT IS JUST 
ANOTHER MONEY MAKING SCHEME PUT OUT 
BY THE COUNCIL 
THEY ARE NOT 
AGAINST RECYCLING EVERYBODY AGREES 
THAT RECYCLING HAS TO BE INCREASED 
BUT IT IS AN UNFAIR TAX ON THE 
HARD WORKING LOCAL PEOPLE OF THIS 
AREA AREA BUT THERE IS NEW EVIDENCE TO 
SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE DO REGARD GREEN 
ISSUES AS KEY TO THE WAY THEY VOTE 
I. N. LOCAL ELECTIONS THE LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION HAS DONE THE 
FIRST EVER SURVEY OF HOW THE 
ENVIRONMENT IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S 
VOTING INTENTIONS LOCALLY IT 
SAYS 
THEY THINK THE REAL CHALLENGE IS TO 
MOVE AWAY FROM THINKING THAT AT A 
LOCAL LEVEL THE ENVIRONMENT ONLY 
MEANS CLEAN STREETS AND RECYCLING 
TOWARDS RECOGNISING THAT IT HAS 
REAL ROLE TO PLAY WHEN IT COMES TO 
THE BIGGER ISSUES OF CLIMATE CHANGE 
WE HAVE BEEN BEEN CAMPAIGNING ON 
THE ENVIRONMENT FOR UP TO FORTY YEARS 
NOW AND NOW IT HAS COME UP THE 
AGENDA SO IT IS GOOD FOR US THAT 
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT BUT BUT THE PRESSURE IS ON THE GOVERNMENT 
TO DO MORE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT 
WHETHER THAT IS REDUCING THE AMOUNT 
OF GREENHOUSE GASES OR BURYING 
LESS RUBBISH IN LANDFILL SITES LIKE 
THIS ONE CLIMATE CHANGE MAY BE A 
GLOBAL PROBLEM BUT IT IS 
INCREASINGLY PART OF LOCAL POLITICS 
TOO 
AND DARRYL FOUR PARTIES FIELDING 
CANDIDATES IN THOSE LOCAL COUNCIL 
ELECTIONS THE CONSERVATIVES THE 
LABOUR PARTY THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
AND THE B. N. P. NOW A NEW ERA IN 
ENGLISH RUGBY BEGINS TODAY THE 
FORMER CAPTAIN MARTIN JOHNSON HAS 
BEEN SPEAKING TO THE MEDIA FOR THE 
FIRST TIME AS ENGLAND MANAGER OUR 
SPORTS REPORTER WAS LISTENING IN AT 
TWICKENHAM WHAT DID HE HAVE TO 
SAY SAY WELL IT WAS JUST THE SORT OF NO 
NONSENSE DISPLAY WE USED TO SEE 
FROM IN HIS PLAYING DAYS I AM NOT 
IN IT FOR THE EGO OR THE MONEY HE 
SAID ENGLAND SHOULD BE COMPETING 
AT ALL TIMES WITH THE BEST IN THE 
WORLD LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
COMMENTING ON THE FACT THAT MARTIN 
JOHNSON HAS NO MANAGERIAL OR 
COACHING EXPERIENCE WHATSOEVER BUT 
HE SAYS THIS WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM 
YES IT IS FACT THAT I HAVE GOT 
NO COACHING EXPERIENCE BUT I HAVE 
GOT A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN RUGBY 
UNION OVER SIXTEEN YEARS I HAVE BEEN 
SUCCESSFUL AND EQUALLY IMPORTANT 
I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN TEAMS WHEN 
IT HAS NOT WORKED WHEN WE HAVE 
LOST I THINK THIS GAME IS ALSO 
IS ALWAYS ABOUT PLAYERS IT IS NOT 
ABOUT THE EGO OF COACHES OF COURSE 
COACHES ARE IMPORTANT BUT IT IS 
ABOUT CREATING THE ENVIRONMENT 
WHERE THESE GUYS CAN THRIVE AND CAN 
PLAY AND WE CAN GET THE BEST OUT 
OF THEM AND CREATE THE TEAM 
CULTURE SO I THINK I CAN BE PART 
OF THAT THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT IT 
IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT THE 
PROFILE THAT I HAVE MAYBE BUT IT 
WILL BE ABOUT THE TEAM AND THE 
PLAYERS AND GIVING THEM EVERY 
OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED 
HE IS 
CLEARLY DEFENDING HIS APPOINTMENT 
WHAT HAVE THE RUGBY AUTHORITIES 
BEEN SAYING 
YES THE RFU HAVE BEEN CRITICISED 
FOR THE WAY THEY PUBLICLY AND 
BLATANTLY PURSUED MARTIN JOHNSON 
WHILE HIS PREDECESSOR BRIAN ASHTON 
WAS STILL IN CHARGE TODAY THE RFU 
ADMITTED THAT THEY COULD HAVE 
HANDLED THINGS THAT ARE AND THEY 
SAY THAT LESSONS HAVE BEEN LEARNED 
BUT THEY SAY THAT THEY DID NOT GO 
BEHIND BRIAN ASHTON'S BACK AND 
THEY SAY THEY ARE CONFIDENT THAT HE 
WILL ACCEPT A NEW ROLE WITHIN THE 
NATIONAL ACADEMY 
THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH 
THERE WERE GIANT GOOGLE IS POISED 
TO OVERTAKE I T. V. ONE AS THE BIGGEST 
SINGLE EARNER OF ADVERTISING 
REVENUE IN BRITAIN THE INTERNET 
COMPANY HAS ANNOUNCED A THIRTY PER CENT RISE IN 
WORLDWIDE PROFITS CURRENTLY MORE 
THAN SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION SO FAR THIS YEAR 
NOW IF YOU LEAVE A TIP IN A 
RESTAURANT DO YOU EVER QUESTION 
WHETHER YOUR WAITER OR WAITRESS IS 
GETTING THE MONEY DO YOU WORRY 
THAT THE RESTAURANT MIGHT BE 
HOLDING ON TO MUCH OF WHAT YOU 
GIVE WELL ONE OF THE BIG SERVICE 
TRADE UNIONS UNITE HAS BEGUN A 
CAMPAIGN TO PROTECT STAFF AMID 
CONCERNS THAT MANY ARE GETTING A 
ROUGH DEAL 
A NICE MEAL PLEASANT COMPANY AND 
GOOD SERVICE AT THE END YOU WANT 
TO PAY A TIP BUT WHERE DOES THE 
MONEY GO AT PIZZA EXPRESS EIGHT PER CENT OF 
ALL TIPS GO BACK TO THE COMPANY AS 
AN ADMINISTRATION FEE LEVIED ON 
THE STAFF IT IS A VERY HIGH COST 
WAITING STAFF ARE HISTORICALLY VERY 
POORLY PAID 
THIS IS A TOP RESTAURANT CHAIN BUT 
IT RESORTS TO USING THE STAFF TIPS 
TO KEEP THE RIGHT SIDE OF 
EMPLOYMENT LAW THIS IS HOW IT 
WORKS THE MINIMUM WAGE IS BUT 
WAITER'S START AT 
THIS IS NOT ILLEGAL BECAUSE IT 
USES TIPS FROM CUSTOMERS TO MAKE UP 
THE DIFFERENCE 
WE ARE CALLING ON 
THOSE PEOPLE THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO 
GET GOOD SERVICE FROM OUR MEMBERS 
IN THE INDUSTRY TO BE ASKING 
QUESTIONS TO ASK WHERE IS THEIR 
MONEY GOING L. BELIEVE THEY THINK 
IT IS GOING TO THE WAITERS AND 
WAITRESSES BUT IT MAY NOT HAVE 
DONE 
THESE CUSTOMERS WERE NOT HAPPY WHEN 
THEY FIND OUT WHERE THEIR TIPS WERE 
GOING 
I HAVE ALWAYS ACCEPTED THAT GOING THIS IS A SORT OF UNFORTUNATE 
PRACTICE WHICH RESTAURANTS INDULGE 
IN I DO NOT SUPPORT IT BUT I 
THINK THE TIPS SHOULD GO TO THE 
WAITERS 
THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS WAITERS HAS HAD A REPUTATION FOR SOME 
QUESTIONABLE EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES 
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO TIPS THE 
UNIONS SAY STAFF SHOULD GET A 
BIGGER SLICE NOW JUST ONE MORE 
STORY TO BRING YOU BEFORE WE TAKE A 
LOOK 
AT THE WEATHER FORECAST WE 
HAVE ALL SEEN NODDING DOGS IN THE 
REAR WINDOW OF THE CAR IN FRONT OF 
YOU BUT HERE IS A NEW ONE THIS IS 
POLICE IN TEXAS WHO STOPPED A 
MOTORIST BECAUSE HE WAS SEEN 
DRIVING ERRATICALLY AND THIS IS 
WHY INSIDE THE VEHICLE THIS IS 
WHAT THE POLICE FOUND AN ALLIGATOR 
NEARLY TWO METRES LONG THE 
MOTORIST WAS ARRESTED AS YOU MIGHT 
IMAGINE THE ALLIGATOR WAS RELEASED 
AND TAKEN TO A WILDLIFE RESERVE NOW WE'RE 
GOING 
TO TURN OUR 
ATTENTIONS TO THE WEATHER PROSPECTS 
BUT ALSO IN ADDITION TO THAT LOTS 
OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CONTACTING THE 
B. B. C. THIS MORNING BECAUSE 
APPARENTLY WHEN PEOPLE WOKE UP 
THERE WAS A RATHER PECULIAR SMELL 
IN THE AIR AND YOU ARE THE WOMAN 
TO EXPLAIN WHY 
I AM GLAD YOU DID NOT SAY THE WOMAN 
RESPONSIBLE YES I CAN EXPLAIN WHY 
MOST OF US WOKE UP TO SOMETHING IN 
THE AIR IT IS A COLD WINTER DAY 
AN EASTERLY WIND AND BECAUSE IT IS 
COMING FROM THE EAST IT TRACKS 
WITH IT THE PARTICLES FROM WHENCE 
IT HAS COME IT HAS COME OVER 
FACTORIES IT CAN PICK UP POLLUTION 
OR NASTY SMELLS FROM FERTILISERS 
SO WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SMELLING IS 
THE RESULT OF WHAT THE FARMERS HAVE 
BEEN DOING ON THE CONSIDERED ON 
THE CONTINENT 
OVERNIGHT TONIGHT I THINK IT WILL 
BE STAYING MOSTLY DRY IN THE NORTH 
FURTHER SOUTH MORE RAIN WILL BE 
MOVING UP ACROSS SOUTHERN ENGLAND 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE DROPPING 
PERHAPS JUST A TOUCH OF FROST IN 
SCOTLAND ALTHOUGH WE WILL STILL 
HAVE THE KEEN EASTERLY WINDS SO 
THERE WILL NOT BE TOO MUCH OF A 
FROST IN THE SOUTH ON SATURDAY 
MORNING THERE WILL BE RAIN NOT A 
GREAT START TO THE WEEKEND A 
STRONG AND CUSTODY EASTERLY WIND 
WILL BE CONTINUING A STRONG AND 
GUSTY EASTERLY WIND FURTHER NORTH 
GREYER SKIES BUT HOPEFULLY A DRY 
START AND THEN IT IS NOT TOO BAD 
FOR MORE THAN ENGLAND SCOTLAND AND 
NORTHERN IRELAND NORTHERN 
ENGLAND 
SO THERE WILL BE SOME DRIER AND 
BRIGHTER WEATHER AROUND THIS 
WEEKEND LOOKING FURTHER SOUTH 
ACROSS WALES THIS GUY'S CLOUDING 
OVER AND RAIN URGING HIM FROM THE 
SOUTH THE SKIES 
SCOTLAND ENJOYING THE BEST OF THE 
SUNSHINE NOT TOO BAD FOR NORTHERN 
IRELAND SO A CHILLY DAY ON 
SATURDAY SUNDAY WE SHOULD SEE 
THOSE TEMPERATURES RECOVERING 
SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND ARE 
ALWAYS ENJOYING SOMETHING DRIER A 
SIMILAR STORY ON MONDAY IT LOOKS 
LIKE WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL 
TUESDAY AND ALL OF THE U. K. IS 
ENJOYING SOMETHING A BIT DRY AND 
BRIGHTER 
I'M SO GLAD YOU CLEARED THAT UP 
A REMINDER OF OUR MAIN STORY A MAN 
IS BEING QUESTIONED UNDER THE 
TERRORISM ACT AFTER A CONTROLLED 
EXPLOSION AT A HOUSE IN BRISTOL THIRTY 
PEOPLE HAD TO BE MOVED OUT OF THEIR
