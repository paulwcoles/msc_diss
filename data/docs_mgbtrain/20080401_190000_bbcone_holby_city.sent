HAVE YOU HAD TO STOP WORK YET WITH THE TREATMENT 
YES I'M ON LONG TERM SICK LEAVE 
I TOLD THIS CONTRACTOR THAT HE DRESSED LIKE A 
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD BUT IT DIDN'T QUITE WORK WITH HIS EIGHTY YEAR OLD FACE 
HE THOUGHT I WAS DRUNK I KNEW I COULDN'T GO ON IT WASN'T FAIR ON THE COMPANY 
I MEAN I COULD SEE THEIR FACES 
THEY WEREN'T ANGRY THEY JUST PITIED ME 
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT PITY DOESN'T DO IT FOR ME 
YEAH ME NEITHER 
OH YOUR FILM

YOU DID THE RIGHT THING WITH THAT NURSE 
SHE NEEDED TO BE TOLD GIVING PEOPLE FALSE HOPES 
IT ISN'T KIND 
IS THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH ME 
GIVING ME FALSE HOPE 
NO YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT 
YOU HAVE LIAR WRITTEN ALL OVER YOUR FACE 
WELL BOTTOM LINE IS I DON'T KNOW 
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW YOUR CASE 
BUT I DO KNOW THAT IT'S NOT GOOD TO GIVE UP HOPE 
TRY AND STAY POSITIVE 
SO EASY FOR YOU TO SAY 
GOOD LUCK 
THANKS I THINK I'M GOING TO NEED IT 
THERE'S ALWAYS A RISK 
IT SEEMS TO BE WELL AND TRULY FUSED HERE 
I THINK WE'RE NEARLY THERE 
LET'S CALL MR. SPENCE 
KIDNEY DISH THE SVC IS FREE 
SEND THAT TO HISTOLOGY SUCTION 
I THINK WE CLEARED THE RESIDUAL BUT THE VEINS ARE QUITE SHAVED 
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO CLOSE PLEASE 
YOU GET IT ALL WE DID ALL RIGHT LET'S GIVE HIM BACK HIS FACE BACK 
O. K. WE'VE GOT ANOTHER BLEED SOFT CLAMPS MORE FOUR TO ZERO AND SUCTION QUICKLY SUCTION 
MORE FOUR TO ZERO 
WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT BIRTH DEATH THE BIT IN BETWEEN 
I HAVEN'T GOT THE FAINTEST BUT 
I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT 
I THINK IT'S TO LOVE AND BE LOVED 
TO HOPE YOUR PHOTO REMAINS ON A MANTLE PIECE SOMEWHERE AND STILL MAKES PEOPLE LAUGH AND CRY 
IF WE CAN ACHIEVE THAT IT'S GOT TO BE WORTH IT HASN'T IT 
DON'T LET IT SLIP THROUGH YOUR FINGERS 
AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO DRIVE A ROLLS ROYCE 
HAVE THE DECENCY TO SMILE ABOUT IT 
I MADE IT THEN 
WE DID RUN INTO COMPLICATIONS IN THEATRE 
YOU COULDN'T DO IT WE REMOVED THE TUMOUR ON YOUR LUNG BUT IN THE PROCESS 
THE MAJOR VESSEL WAS DAMAGED 
AND THIS IS STILL 
FIRMLY ATTACHED IT SEEMED UNNECESSARY TO PUT YOU THROUGH ANY MORE 
WE THOUGHT IT BEST NOT TO PROCEED WITH THAT PART OF THE OPERATION 
I NEED TO RECOVER FIRST 
THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY REMOVING THE TUMOUR WAS SEVERE 
WE TALKED ABOUT A WORSE CASE SCENARIO 
THE REPAIR THAT I HAVE DONE 
WON'T HOLD FOR LONG 
WE CAN KEEP YOU TOPPED UP WITH FLUIDS BUT 
IT'S GOING TO GIVE WAY AGAIN 
COULDN'T YOU HAVE LET ME GO 
MR. HOPE HAD TO DO EVERYTHING HE COULD 
WHAT ARE WE SAYING HERE 
THAT WE WILL MAKE YOU AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE 
NICE PLATITUDE I'M SORRY 
THIS IS MY FAULT ISN'T IT 
NO WE DIDN'T EVEN GET AS FAR AS THE SECOND OPERATION 
YEAH BUT THE EXTRA ANAESTHETIC MADE HIM WEAKER 
BOTH MR. SPENCE AND I BELIEVED IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE 
I DON'T TAKE UNNECESSARY RISKS YOU KNOW THAT 
WE NEEDED TO REMOVE AN EMBOLUS A SORT OF FATTY DEPOSIT 
BEFORE IT CAUSED A MASSIVE STROKE 
OH MY GOD BEN ALSO HAS PFO PATENT FORAMEN OVALE IT'S A HOLE BETWEEN THE CHAMBERS IN THE HEART 
MRS. BEAUCHAMP SEALED THE HOLE IT WAS PRETTY INCREDIBLE HE'S VERY LUCKY IS THIS DOWN TO HIS DIET 
NO BEN WAS BORN WITH THIS 
ANY STRAIN TO THE HEART CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS 
LIKE HAVING AN OPERATION POSSIBLY 
DOES THIS MEAN HE'S GOING TO BE IN FOR A BIT LONGER A FEW DAYS 
AND HE'S GOING TO BE FINE 
HE IS GONNA BE A NEW MAN 
YOU MUST BE REALLY PROUD OF HIM I AM 
ERM HE'LL BE COMING ROUND IN A MINUTE 
OH I. I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE WHEN HE WAKES UP 
HE'S GONNA WANT TO SEE YOU 
NO HE WON'T 
NOT REALLY 
I'LL CALL HIS MUM 
HE'S NOT THE MAN I FELL IN LOVE WITH 
AND I DON'T THINK I REALLY MAKE THE GRADE ANY MORE 
WELL HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THIS 
AT LEAST WE NEVER HAD KIDS 
WE CAN BOTH START AGAIN NO ONE ELSE GETS HURT 
SORRY I AM LATE I'VE BEEN ENTERTAINING MYSELF 
DINNER'S NOT FOR ANOTHER HALF AN HOUR YOU LOOK FANTASTIC 
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE THE EFFORT YEAH I GUESS YOU HAVE 
SO DO YOU ALWAYS GO RUNNING TO MAMA EVERY TIME THERE IS A PROBLEM IN THEATRE 
WE WOULD'VE LOST THAT PATIENT IF I HADN'T YOU DON'T KNOW THAT 
IT WAS A BIT TOUCH AND GO THERE BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO LEARN TO HOLD YOUR NERVE 
THE POINT IS IT WAS MY CALL AND I WOULD HAVE MADE IT WHEN I HAD TO 
YOU HAD TO MICHAEL AND YOU DIDN'T 
CAN YOU BELIEVE SHE'S NEVER DONE THAT OPERATION BEFORE 
YEAH I KNOW SHE'S ONLY SEEN IT 
I DON'T THINK SHE HAS NO NO NO SHE SAID SHE'D SEEN LORD BROCK DO IT BEFORE 
HOW OLD DO YOU THINK CONNIE IS LATE THIRTIES 
LORD BROCK DIED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY SEVEN CONNIE WAS STILL AT SCHOOL 
SO NURSE JACKSON NOT HERE YET 
ER NO SHE 
SHE HAD A FAMILY CRISIS SHE HAD TO BAIL OUT 
OH NO SHE WILL BE SO UPSET SHE WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO IT 
ANYWAY LUCKY MS. NAYLOR NOW KEITH WAS TELLING US THAT YOU MUST HAVE BEEN 
THE BRITISH DOOGIE HOWSER TO WATCH LORD BROCK IN ACTION 
SO COME ON WHAT'S THE STORY CONNIE I DON'T THINK I ACTUALLY SAID I WAS THERE 
I HAVE JUST WATCHED FILM OF THE PROCEDURE SEVERAL TIMES THAT'S ALL 
WAIT A MINUTE A MOVIE 
IN MY FIRST YEAR 
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A TOAST FOR THE OLD BOY 
RIGHT I NEED TO CIRCULATE 
I REALLY DID THINK HE LIKED YOU 
YEAH WELL HE DOESN'T NOT LIKE THAT 
HE'S KIDDING HIMSELF YOU COULD ALWAYS SLEEP WITH HIM 
AND TAKE IT FROM THERE IS THIS THE DONNA TECHNIQUE TO GETTING YOUR MAN 
YOU KNOW PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS SHOW HIM THE TIME OF HIS LIFE 
AND HE'LL RESPECT ME IN THE MORNING WILL HE 
IF YOU DO IT PROPERLY YOU WON'T RESPECT YOURSELF 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TAKING IT SLOWLY ANYWAY IT'S NOT WORKING IS IT 
MEN USELESS THE LOT OF THEM FANCY A DRINK 
TO BE HONEST I JUST WANT TO GO HOME YEAH I'LL COME WITH YOU 
ONE THINK I'VE LEARNT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS SINCE I WAS CORRECTLY DIAGNOSED WITH 
A TERMINAL ILLNESS IS THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE THE MOST OF OUR TIME 
WHAT'S THE POINT IN WANTING TO DO SOMETHING 
IF WE NEVER GET ROUND TO DOING IT 
BECAUSE ONE DAY 
TOMORROW NEVER COMES 
IT'S GOOD 
OH IT'S ERM IT'S JUST WORDS 
PLAYING THE PART TO THE END 
THAT WON'T EVEN MAKE CHIP PAPER IN A FEW DAYS 
I'M SORRY ABOUT 
WHAT I SAID BEFORE THE OPERATION 
BUT YOU DID THINK YOU WERE A BIT SPECIAL THOUGH DIDN'T YOU 
I WAS QUITE PRETTY 
YOU STILL ARE 
IF YOU KEEP THEM ON YOUR GOOD SIDE 
NOT FUNNY 
SO WHAT HAPPENED IT WAS A SURGEON WHO WORKED HERE 
HE CUT ME WITH A SCALPEL 
WE WERE SEEING EACH OTHER 
IT HAPPENED IN THE THEATRE WHERE THEY OPERATED ON YOU 
HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING HE EVEN TRIED TO PATCH ME UP 
I WISH I'D NEVER MET HIM 
BEATS MY KNIFE THROWING STORY 
YOU DON'T NEED TO STAY WITH ME 
I WANT TO 
WE'RE FRIENDS AREN'T WE I MEAN THAT'S ALL MIND YOU 
I'M NOT READY FOR THIS 
NO ONE EVER IS 
SO WHAT DIDN'T YOU DO 
START WITH THE BIG ONE 
FORGIVE SOMEBODY 
A LONG TIME AGO 
SOMEBODY 
I COULD HAVE GROWN OLD WITH 
OR NOT SO OLD 
I WAS TOO STUBBORN 
I COULDN'T BREAK THE PATTERN 
WHICH IS 
WHY I'M ALONE NOW I GUESS 
WHAT WAS HER NAME 
WHATEVER IT IS SHE DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW I'VE BEEN REALLY STUPID 
YEAH YOU SHOULD GET IT TATTOOED ON YOUR FOREHEAD PLEASE 
DO YOU WANT ME TO STAY 
JUST GIVE US A FEW SECONDS 
I'M SORRY I'VE BEEN AN IDIOT 
NO YOU WERE HONEST 
YOU'VE KEPT ME GOING 
AND I DON'T WANT TO JEOPARDIZE WHAT WE HAVE BY TURNING IT INTO SOMETHING ELSE 
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO BE 
A FRIEND 
O. K. 
WE'VE GOT THIS TO WATCH 
YEAH I'LL BRING IT IN TOMORROW 
WE COULD WATCH IT TONIGHT 
I'M BUSY 
SORRY 
THAT'S COOL 
I'LL ER 
I'LL SEE YOU 
IF RAMIREZ WAS IMMORTAL THEN HOW COME HE IS OLDER THAN MACLEOD 
MY THEORY IS THAT YOU BECOME IMMORTAL WHEN YOU'RE KILLED OR REGENERATE FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SO MACLEOD STOPS GETTING OLD THE FIRST TIME HE HAS THE BATTLE WITH THE ERM THE KURGAN 
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU SEEN THIS FILM 
FORTY THREE 
YOU'VE KEPT COUNT 
IT'S A BOY THING 
DO YOU WANT TO MAKE IT FORTY FOUR 
YEAH I WOULD 
WE'RE GOING TO WATCH A FILM YOU STILL COMING I'VE GOT SOME WINE 
ER JUST FRIENDS 
RIGHT IS IT RED OR WHITE 
DOES IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE NO BUT IT SOUNDED GOOD DIDN'T IT 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
I'M LEAVING IT'S BEEN A TOUGH DAY 
I CAN SWING YOU SOME COMPASSIONATE LEAVE IF YOU NEED IT 
OH DAD I'M NOT AFTER A WEEK'S LEAVE WHAT THEN 
I NEED TO GET BETTER SOMEWHERE ELSE YOUR FRIENDS ARE HERE I'M HERE 
I NEED SOME TIME ON MY OWN AND I JUST CAN'T GET THAT HERE 
IS THIS ALL ABOUT THAT TOE RAG OF A REP 
HE WAS RIGHT I NEEDED SOMEBODY AND I'VE GOT TO CHANGE THAT 
BY RUNNING AWAY 
BY NOT NEEDING A MAN TO SOLVE MY PROBLEMS I DO IT ALL THE TIME 
I DID IT WITH OWEN MICHAEL BEAUCHAMP SAM 
BUT THIS ONE 
HE REALLY DID LEAVE HIS MARK 
I NEED TO BREAK THIS PATTERN 
YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO COME BACK TO WORK I CAN SORT IT COS YOU'VE GOT THE TRUST OVER A BARREL 
WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING FOR ME 
NO LOOK LOOK JUST LET ME PUT IT IN YOUR ACCOUNT THEN IF YOU GET IN TROUBLE YOU KNOW IT'S THERE 
I WISH I COULD GIVE YOU THE CASH AND BUNG THIS ON THE FIRE BUT 
PLEASE FOR ME 
THEN I'LL KNOW YOU CAN COME HOME IF YOU NEED TO 
I LOVE YOU 
GOOD 
COS YOU'RE ALL I'VE GOT 
I'M DEAD IT'S WEIRD TO THINK THAT I'M NO LONGER THERE 
BUT IT WAS AN EVENTFUL LAST DAY 
I EVEN MET A GIRL 
THAT WAS IN BETWEEN BEING SCANNED POKED PRODDED AND CATHETERISED 
IN THE END I HAD NO SECRETS FROM HER 
I TOOK A CHANCE 
IT WAS A SLIM ONE AND SOD'S LAW IT DIDN'T PAY OFF 
DON'T YOU JUST HATE IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS 
BUT A FRIEND TOLD ME ONCE WE ONLY REGRET THE THINGS WE DIDN'T DO 
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD RULE FOR LIFE 
TAKE YOUR CHANCES WHEN THEY COME ALONG 
THEY MIGHT NOT BE THERE TOMORROW 
TAKE THIS SINKING BOAT AND POINT IT HOME 
WE'VE STILL GOT TIME 
ONE GIL MCCRAE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD MEMBER OF RIVAL GANG THE GLORY 
I DON'T WANT GANG WARFARE OUT THERE 
WE FOUND THIS NEXT TO VICTIM NUMBER THREE 
A NEW BREED OF CRIMINAL 
IT'S A CALL TO WAR
