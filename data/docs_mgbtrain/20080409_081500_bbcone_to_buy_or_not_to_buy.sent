IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS ALL THE RAGE YEAH I CAN REMEMBER THE EIGHTIES I WAS TEN THEN 
AND YOU'RE STILL REVIVING IT SINGLE HANDEDLY VERY IMPRESSIVE 
WHAT'S THAT DOES THAT GO INTO THE GARAGE 
OH IT'S A CUPBOARD THAT'S WHERE YOU GO WHEN YOU'RE NAUGHTY 
HE'S NOT HAPPY I THINK HE WAS LOOKING FOR AN ENTRANCE TO THE GARAGE H. M. M. THERE ISN'T ONE 
NO HALLWAY AT ALL 
THAT'S IT IT JUST GOES FROM ONE ROOM STRAIGHT INTO THE NEXT 
I DON'T REMEMBER HER SAYING OR HIM THAT THEY WANT A HALLWAY DID SHE SAY IT TO YOU 
THIS IS NICE 
I DO LIKE THIS NICE CONSERVATORY WE BOTH WANTED ONE OF THESE REALLY 
I DO WANT A CONSERVATORY THIS IS LOVELY 
AH THE GLASS HOUSE 
BIT OF A DOWNSIDE WITH THE GARDEN OR LACK OF GARDEN 
ISN'T VERY BIG 
HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TOO MUCH WORK LOW MAINTENANCE THEY CAN TRIM THAT LAWN WITH SCISSORS 
THE KITCHEN IS QUITE NICE YES NOT BAD AT ALL BUT I KNOW YOU'LL WANT TO CHANGE IT 
IT'S LIVEABLE NO IT'S NICE BUT IS THAT A UTILITY ROOM YEAH LOOKS LIKE IT 
BIT OF A STRANGE ROOM REALLY THE WAY IT COMES OFF THE KITCHEN 
GOOD USE OF SPACE YEAH BUT WHAT WAS IT INITIALLY 
FRIDGE FREEZER WASHING MACHINE IT'S LIKE A LITTLE LEAN TO TYPE THING ISN'T IT 
HANDY THOUGH YES IT IS QUITE NICE BIGGER THAN WHAT WE'VE GOT 
DEFINITELY YEAH ANYTHING IS BIGGER THAN WHAT WE'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT 
A MATCHBOX WOULD BE BIGGER THAN WHAT THEY GOT 
I SAID IT WAS SMALL BUT LET'S HAVE A LITTLE LOOK 
SEE IF IT'S AMBER FRIENDLY 
THE STEPS AIN'T 
STEPS ARE NOT AMBER FRIENDLY NO 
IT'S HARD TO TELL IF THEY'RE EXCITED 
IF THEY'RE OVERWHELMED SPEECHLESS WITH JOY OR JUST REALLY ANGRY 
IT'S VERY PRETTY AND I LIKE WHAT THEY'VE DONE 
THEY'VE GOT LITTLE BORDERS 
SHALL WE HAVE A LOOK UPSTAIRS YEAH HAVE A LOOK UPSTAIRS 
DOWNSTAIRS A LITTLE BIT SORT OF UM BUT YOU KNOW UPSTAIRS SHOULD DO IT 
THE FIRST BEDROOM 
THIS IS THE SMALLEST ROOM THE GUEST ROOM 
TILL THE NEXT BABY COMES 
YOU CAN SEE HER PRIORITIES I WANT A HOUSE MARRIAGE ANOTHER BABY 
THIS WILL BE AMBER'S BEDROOM 
SLIGHTLY BIGGER THAN THE LAST ONE IT'S A BOY'S ROOM YES IT DOES LOOK NICE 
IT DOES YEAH THE WAY THAT IT HAS BEEN DONE A TYPICAL FAMILY TYPE HOME 
ALWAYS GOOD WHEN PEOPLE ALLOCATE BEDROOMS BEFORE THEY'VE BOUGHT THE PROPERTY 
THAT'S NOT BAD 
IT'S A WHITE SUITE 
WHICH IS VERY FASHIONABLE 
OH YES LIKE YOU DEAR 
HE IS NOT MAKING ANY COMMENTS HE'S JUST RESPONDING TO HER REACTIONS

NOW NICKI YOU WALKED INTO THE LOUNGE 
BUT IT DIDN'T FLOAT YOUR BOAT NO FIRSTLY NO HALLWAY

YOU DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU WALK STRAIGHT INTO THE LOUNGE YES 
O. K. GOING INTO THE NEXT ROOM WHICH IS THE DINING ROOM YOU LIKED SOMEWHAT MORE 
SO IT'S BIGGER ESPECIALLY WITHOUT THIS BULKY FURNITURE YEAH 
SO WHY DON'T WE SWAP THOSE TWO ROOMS ROUND YEAH I WAS KIND OF THINKING THAT YOU WERE YEAH 
SO YOU DON'T WALK STRAIGHT INTO YOUR LOUNGE YEAH THIS IS MORE PRIVATE 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE THAT JAZZED BY THE DECOR BUT WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO THIS 
DECORATION WISE OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT YEAH TO MAKE IT INTO A LIVING ROOM 
YEAH 
UM I MEAN YES YOU COULD GET YOUR TELLY AND YOUR SOFAS AND EVERYTHING IN HERE THAT WOULD BE FINE 
THAT IS A BETTER IDEA WHAT YOU'VE SUGGESTED 
AND AS YOU SAY THE CONSERVATORY'S NOT HUGE 
IT'S NOT CRYSTAL PALACE 
IT'S A NICE OPEN SPACE YOU CAN PUT AMBER'S TOYS IN THERE AND STUFF 
YEP SO I THINK YOU SAID IT YOURSELF IT'S A NICE FAMILY HOME 
THE TEMPLATE WORKS QUITE NICELY YEAH 
I THINK YOU'VE GOT THE IMAGINATION TO BRING IT ALIVE 
DARREN YOU SAID YOU WANTED A GARAGE ALL THE WAY ALONG BECAUSE YOU WANT IT FOR A GYM YEAH 
NOT TO PUT THE CAR IN IT NO I DON'T WANT TO PUT THE CAR IN IT 
ALL RIGHT WELL I'M NO BOXER I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO SPAR A COUPLE 
OF TIMES AND GET INVOLVED BUT YOU KNOW I'M TOO BUSY 
TO ME THIS WOULD BE IDEAL AS A LITTLE GYM 
IT'S NOT A BAD SIZE BUT I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO ACTUALLY COME THROUGH THE GARAGE DOOR 
I'D LIKE TO COME INTO IT THROUGH ANOTHER DOOR 
I'VE GOT AN IDEA FOR THAT I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT SOME THINGS 
WHAT'S UNUSUAL IS HALF OF IT IS OUT THERE ALL EXPOSED 
THE OTHER HALF IS UNDERNEATH ONE OF THE BEDROOMS YEAH

YOU DID SAY YOU WAS A BIT ANNOYED THAT THERE WASN'T AN INTEGRAL DOOR JOINING IT TO THE INSIDE 
YOU SEE HERE YOU'VE GOT THESE CONCRETE BLOCKS HERE 
THAT SECTION THERE IS IN LINE WITH THE HALLWAY INSIDE 
IT WOULDN'T ACTUALLY BE A HUGE JOB TO PUT A DOOR IN THERE

IF DARREN DID WANT TO PUT A DOOR THROUGH FROM THE GARAGE 
HE'D HAVE TO FIREPROOF IT ACCORDING TO REGULATIONS 
AND IF NICKI WANTED TO EXTEND THE KITCHEN INTO THIS UTILITY SPACE 
SHE'D NEED TO CHECK THAT IT'S NOT CLASSED AS A TEMPORARY STRUCTURE 
CONTENDER NUMBER TWO IN THE RING IS THIS ATTRACTIVE THREE BED DETACHED 
AND IT'S A SERIOUS CHALLENGER TO NUMBER ONE 
IT'S JUST THAT LITTLE BIT BIGGER AND A LITTLE BIT MORE LUXURIOUS AND WE KNOW NICKI LIKES HER LUXURIES 
IT MAY NOT HAVE AN EN SUITE BUT THAT IS MORE THAN MADE UP FOR WITH THE INCREASED BEDROOM AND LIVING SPACE

YOU NEED BUILDING REGS' APPROVAL DUE TO THE DIFFERENCE IN FLOOR LEVELS 
YOU DON'T WANT KIDS GETTING THEIR HEADS STUCK 
THE FINAL PROPERTY IS OUR WILD CARD AND IT'S MY CHOICE 
I THINK THIS ONE'S REALLY GONNA PACK A PUNCH WHEN IT COMES TO THE PROPERTY STAKES 
WE'RE SENDING WALDERSLADE INTO THE CORNER OF THE RING AND BRINGING ON 
AYLESFORD A GORGEOUS LITTLE VILLAGE TUCKED AWAY IN THE MEDWAY VALLEY 
IT'S AN UPMARKET LOCATION 
IT'S ONE OF THE OLDEST AND MOST PICTURESQUE VILLAGES IN KENT 
AND IT COMES COMPLETE WITH A TWELFTH CENTURY BRIDGE AND A FRIARY 
IT MIGHT BE THE ONLY SEMI WE'RE SHOWING THEM AND IT MIGHT NEED 
A LITTLE BIT OF WORK BUT AS THEY SAY LOCATION IS EVERYTHING SO LET'S SEE IF IT'S A KNOCKOUT 
US TALL ONES WALK IN THE GUTTER AND THE SHORTIES ARE ON THE PAVEMENT 
IN THE GUTTER'S WHERE YOU BELONG 
LIKE TOM CRUISE NEEDING LITTLE PLATFORMS 
RIGHT O. K. PROPERTY THREE MY CHOICE THE WILD CARD 
HERE IT IS IT'S THE BARRY MCGUIGAN OF THE PROPERTY WORLD 
IT DOESN'T LOOK MUCH BUT IT CAN CERTAINLY PACK A PUNCH 
THE REASON WHY IT'S WILD IS BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS PERFECT FOR YOU 
I ALSO KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE TOTALLY SUSSED ON IT STRAIGHT AWAY 
DO YOU REALISE DARREN HASN'T ACTUALLY SPOKEN A WORD YET 
WELL I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE YOU DON'T LET HIM RABBIT GO ON 
IT LOOKS ALL RIGHT ON THE OUTSIDE BUT WE'LL SEE WHEN WE GET INSIDE IT LOOKS NICE 
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING KRISTIAN HAS DELIVERED HERE THIS HOUSE 
RIGHT ON ITS DOORSTEP AT THE END OF THE ROAD HAS GOT A PRIMARY SCHOOL A VERY VERY POPULAR PRIMARY SCHOOL 
THE HOUSE WAS BUILT IN ABOUT THE EIGHTIES 
AND WE'VE GOT A FUNNY FEELING THE DECOR HAS NEVER BEEN CHANGED 
NOTHING STRUCTURAL BUT PROBABLY WANTS A LITTLE BIT OF A FACELIFT A BIT LIKE KRISTIAN 
GO IN TELL US WHAT YOU THINK 
O. K. RIGHT HOW'S IT GOING DOMINIC YOU STAY DOWN THERE IN THE GUTTER 
THANKS VERY MUCH 
IF WE DON'T GET A KNOCKOUT IT'LL GO TO POINTS AND A JUDGES' DECISION 
WE DON'T WANT THAT DO WE NO 
RIGHT 
NO HALLWAY BUT QUITE A GOOD SIZED ROOM 
QUITE A GOOD SIZE SHE NEVER SAID THAT IN THE FIRST TWO PROPERTIES 
NO HALLWAY NO HALLWAY 
PUNCHED BY MY OWN CHOICE 
I'M TRYING TO LOOK PAST THIS FURNITURE ACTUALLY BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE BIT DATED MAYBE 
WRONG SETTEE FOR THAT ROOM IT'S A FABRIC BLOCKAGE 
ROOM ON THE LEFT 
DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM 
OH AND KIND OF A UTILITY AREA 
YOU'VE GOT A BIT OF STORAGE SPACE HIDDEN AWAY 
YOUR VACUUM CLEANER DUSTPAN AND BRUSH ARE YOU STROKING A CAT 
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MY HAND'S DOING WELL STOP DOING IT THEN 
SO IT'S LIKE A THROUGH LOUNGE SLASH DINER THROUGH ROOM 
AS PER USUAL SHE'S DOING ALL THE TALKING 
INTO THE KITCHEN OOH AND A CONSERVATORY 
ALWAYS DOES IT FOR ME 
WHATEVER WE SHOW HER IT'S THE CONSERVATORY THAT DOES IT FOR HER 
MY GIRLFRIEND IT'S FLOWERS AND CHOCOLATES 
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW YOU'D NEVER GIVEN HER ANY I'VE SHOWN HER PICTURES 
THE KITCHEN'S NOT BAD IN ITSELF BUT IT'S NOT MY THING 
I FEEL MAYBE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF WASTED SPACE 
I THINK I'D HAVE THIS DOOR OFF 
TAKE THE DOOR OFF AND USE THE SPACE BEHIND IT'S A WASTE 
IT IS A BIT YEAH QUITE OFTEN THEY'VE GOT TO KEEP THAT DOOR FOR 
FIRE AND SAFETY REGULATIONS SO THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO REMOVE THAT 
INTO THE CONSERVATORY 
NOT A BAD SIZE PROBABLY GET RID OF THE TABLE FROM THE DINING ROOM MAYBE PUT IT OUT HERE 
I LIKE IT BECAUSE THAT'S THE PERFECT PLACE FOR IT 
INTO THE GARDEN NICE 
NOT A BAD SIZE REALLY 
NO NOT VERY PRIVATE 
WELL OVERLOOKED IT'S A SMALL GARDEN BUT IT'S QUITE NICE 
BLUE AND WHITE CRYSTAL HERE 
THIS TRELLISWORK AND THIS LITTLE SWING 
UPSTAIRS YEAH UPSTAIRS WE GO MATE 
WE'D HAVE TO CHANGE THIS CARPET OH YOU KNOW THAT YEAH 
IF YOU ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THEM SHE SAYS IT HE AGREES YEAH 
IT'S A BIT BRIGHT IN THE SEPARATE TOILET 
IT'S SO BLUE IT'S BOLD BLUE 
LOOK THERE'S BLUE EVERYWHERE AROUND HERE BLUE'S THE COLOUR 
BLUE BATHROOM YEAH THE SUITE 
NEEDS UPDATING BASICALLY THE WHOLE THING NEEDS UPDATING 
THAT BATHROOM IS THE ABSOLUTE LITERAL REINCARNATION OF THE PHRASE BATHROOM BLUES 
WHAT'S THIS 
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A COFFIN IN A HAMMER HORROR FILM 
MORNING DEAR 
INTO THE FIRST BEDROOM YEAH 
WHICH IS PROBABLY THE BOX ROOM THIS WOULDN'T BE A BAD SIZE FOR AMBER 
NO IT'S A GOOD SIZE FOR AMBER THIS IS A BRILLIANT CHILD'S ROOM 
PERFECT SIZE FOR A KID'S BEDROOM SPOT ON 
PERFECT INTO THE NEXT ROOM 
THIS IS ER BRIGHT KRISTIAN MUST HAVE NEEDED SUNGLASSES WHEN HE WAS PICKING THIS OUT 
I THINK HE MUST HAVE NEEDED SOMETHING OOH 
I OBVIOUSLY HAD MY ROSE TINTED GLASSES ON I SAW EVERYTHING IN A MUCH BETTER LIGHT THAN THEY ARE 
BLIMEY IT'S BRIGHT 
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY ABOUT IT IT'S NOT A BAD SIZE 
YOU TELL ME THE LAST TIME YOU SAW A BURGUNDY RADIATOR AND I'LL GIVE YOU A FIVER 
ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AGO I WALKED ROUND THE HOUSE HERE'S A FIVER 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS WE THOUGHT OF THIS ONE AFRICA NICE MAP OF RUSSIA 
SHE'S RIGHT GEOGRAPHICALLY UP THERE THERE'S QUITE A MIX 
YOU'VE GOT THE KIND OF AFRICAN THEME AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE COMMUNIST RUSSIAN THEME WHICH IS 
AN UNUSUAL MIX THIS MUST BE THE MASTER BEDROOM 
DEFINITELY YOUR COLOUR 
WOULDN'T HAVE TO CHANGE NONE OF THAT WOULD YOU 
NO NO I DO LIKE THIS COLOUR 
SECONDS OR MINUTES TILL SHE MENTIONS HER BED 
O. K. THE BED CONVERSATION THE TIME STARTS NOW 
THAT'S A GOOD CHOICE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO CHANGE THAT 
NICE TO LEAVE THAT ON THERE WHAT AND THE BED 
WE'RE EIGHT SECONDS IN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN EIGHT SECONDS BEFORE THEY MENTIONED THAT BED 
ALL THREE BEDROOMS HAVEN'T BEEN BAD SIZES THOUGH HAVE THEY NO THEY HAVEN'T BEEN NO 
ZIP A DEE DOO DAH WE HAD A GOOD COMMENT 
AND YOU'D PROBABLY GET OUR FURNITURE IN SOMEWHERE HERE 
IT'D FIT IN HERE PERFECT 
DOMINIC I AM FEELING BATTERED AND BRUISED FROM THAT WHOLE EXPERIENCE 
THERE IS BLOOD POURING FROM MY EARS IS THERE 
BUT I TELL YOU WHAT THAT FIGHT'S NOT OVER YET COME ON 
DARREN HAS THAT GOT TO BE ONE OF THE MOST DATED SUITES YOU'VE EVER SEEN WELL OUT OF FASHION 
BUT ALSO SEPARATE LAVVY SEPARATE BATHROOM NOT REALLY THE DONE THING ANY MORE IS IT 
SO WHAT AM I GONNA SUGGEST KNOCK THAT THROUGH 
KNOCK THAT THROUGH YEAH GET YOURSELF A BATHROOM AND A TOILET ALL TOGETHER 
BUT THIS IS WHAT I WAS REALLY GONNA SUGGEST I'M LOOKING A LITTLE BIT BEYOND THAT 
LOOK WHERE WE'RE STANDING WASTE OF SPACE ALL RIGHT 
THAT LEADS OFF TO THE BEDROOMS LOOK AT THIS CUPBOARD FOR STARTERS 
YOU'VE GOT A GREAT BIG CUPBOARD NOTHING IN THERE 
SO WHY DON'T WE THINK NOW OF KNOCKING THAT INTO ONE 
YES YOU'RE RIGHT BUT EXTENDING THE BATHROOM RIGHT THE WAY ALONG HERE 
YEAH I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT EXACTLY 
PUT A MODERN WHITE ONE IN THERE WHATEVER COLOURED TILES YOU WANT 
AND YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF A LOVELY BIG BATHROOM ALL IN ONE 
YEAH IT'D BE NICE YOU LIKE THAT 
YEAH I DO YEAH YEAH SHOW SOME EMOTION 
I LIKE IT A LOT SIR WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU JUST WANT A FIGHT 
WOULD YOU JUST SORT OF GO DOM 
YEAH OH VERY GOOD 
WOULD YOU MIND SHAVING BEFORE YOU DO THAT NEXT TIME 
NOW NICKI WE NEED TO TALK BECAUSE I WAS KIND OF HOPING WHEN YOU SAW THIS NICE KITCHEN AND HIS LOVELY 
CONSERVATORY THERE'D BE A GREAT LOVE BUT ACTUALLY YOU WERE LIKE 
DON'T LIKE IT NO WHY 
IT'S NOT MY CHOICE OF KITCHEN I COULD PROBABLY LIVE WITH THIS FOR ABOUT A WEEK 
O. K. IS IT JUST THE UNITS OR THE LAYOUT OR 
I'D CHANGE THE LAYOUT OF IT AND THE UNITS AS WELL SO EVERYTHING 
YOU COULD UTILISE THE SPACE BETTER I THINK THAN IT HAS ALREADY BEEN 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT FOLLOW ME 
LOOK AT THIS BIG CONSERVATORY 
THERE IS A LINTEL ALREADY ACROSS THERE SO YOU CAN REMOVE ALL OF THIS 
THAT WILL STAY STILL SO YOU CAN OPEN THAT AND CONTINUE YOUR KITCHEN 
WHAT A LOVELY GREAT BIG OPEN FLOOR SPACE THAT WOULD GIVE YOU 
ALL OF THIS IN HERE 
JUST RE PLAN IT AND NEW UNITS 
NOT A BAD IDEA NOT A BAD IDEA AT ALL 
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY NICKI I HAVE A FEELING THERE'S BEEN SOME 
CHEATING GOING ON WITH YOUR OTHER HALF YOU COULD BE RIGHT 
DON'T YOU SMELL A RAT YEAH SO I TELL YOU WHAT 
I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE WHAT I'VE GOT HERE ARE THE PROPERTY 
DETAILS OF THIS HOUSE AND I'M ACCIDENTALLY SHOWING YOU THE PRICE 
OH O. K. NOT THAT YOU SAW THAT NOPE 
SHALL WE GO AND PLAY GUESS THE PRICE ABSOLUTELY 
SHALL WE 
I CANNOT BELIEVE HE JUST DID THAT 
IF PROPERTY THREE DOES TURN OUT TO BE THE CHAMPION 
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS TO CONSIDER 
THE EXISTING RANCH STYLE BANISTERS AREN'T PARTICULARLY SAFE 
AS THE GAPS ARE LARGER THAN THE ONE HUNDRED M. M. LEGAL LIMIT 
AND CHILDREN WOULD BE ABLE TO CLIMB THROUGH THEM EASILY 
THOUGH THERE ARE CAT FLAPS CUT INTO THE CONSERVATORY 
THEY COULD EASILY GET REPLACEMENT PANELS FITTED 
O. K. NICKI AND DARREN THIS IS HOUSE NUMBER THREE THE LAST ONE AND IT'S GUESS THE PRICE TIME 
AND SO FAR NICKI YOU'VE BEEN BEATEN 
SHE HAS BUT I'M FEELING CONFIDENT ABOUT THIS 
YOU'VE BEEN TAKING IT ON THE CHIN HAVEN'T YOU I'VE HAD A RAW DEAL 
I THINK TO MAKE IT FAIR WHAT WE'LL DO IS 
WE'LL GET DARREN TO GUESS FIRST DARREN HOW MUCH IS THIS HOUSE 
I RECKON TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
DEAD DEAD 
RIGHT O. K. WHAT DO YOU THINK NICKI 
WELL I'M SORRY BUT CAN I NOT HAVE THE SAME GUESS 
BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING LIKE WHAT I WAS GOING TO GUESS NO SERIOUSLY 
I ACTUALLY HAVE TO SAY I HAVE JUST SMELT A RAT I SMELL TWO RATS 
I SMELL TWO VERY LARGE RATS 
HANG ON A SECOND NICKI YOU'LL HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT NOW 
TWO HUNDRED FOURTEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE OH SO CLOSE BUT SO UNLUCKY 
DARREN YOU'VE GOT THREE OUT OF THREE 
IT'S A CONSPIRACY GENIUS 
THE PRICE WAS BELIEVE IT OR NOT OF COURSE TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND AS YOU BOTH WELL KNOW 
MEANWHILE MORE IMPORTANTLY FORGET ABOUT YOUR ARGUMENTS NOW 
YOU'VE SEEN ALL THREE PROPERTIES SO NO MORE CHEATING 
WHAT WE NEED NOW IS AN ANSWER ABOUT WHICH PROPERTY YOU'D LIKE TO TRY BEFORE YOU BUY 
ON THIS LAPTOP WE'VE PUT PICTURES OF ALL THE THREE PROPERTIES 
IF I GIVE THIS TO YOU WILL YOU PROMISE NOT TO BASH HIM ON THE HEAD 
I'LL TRY MY VERY HARDEST O. K. 
STUDY IT AT YOUR OWN LEISURE AND LET US KNOW WHICH ONE LATER ON YOU WANT TO ROAD TEST RIGHT 
LOVELY WE'LL SEE YOU LATER ON THANK YOU 
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY BEEN CHEATING BEHIND MY BACK I WOULDN'T DO SUCH A THING 
AND WHILE THEY STUDY THE LAPTOP 
SHE WAS FUMING ABSOLUTELY 
WILL THEY GO FOR MY CHOICE THAT COMPACT BUT DELIGHTFUL 
THREE BEDROOM DETACHED WITH THE EN SUITE CONSERVATORY AND INTEGRAL GARAGE FOR DARREN'S GYM 
IT COULD BE THEIRS FOR TWO HUNDRED GRAND 
OR DOM THEY MIGHT WANT TO OPT FOR OUR JOINT CHOICE WITH THE LUXURIOUS LOUNGE READY MADE NURSERY 
AND THE WOW FACTOR IN THE KITCHEN AND OF COURSE THE SECOND BEDROOM 
A STEAL AT TWO HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND 
YOU KNOW CHRIS YOUR WILD CARD CHOICE THE OUTSIDER MIGHT JUST RANK HIGHLY 
AFTER ALL IT'S IN GLORIOUS AYLESFORD AND THE MASSIVE BEDROOMS 
AND FAMILY FRIENDLY GARDEN MIGHT JUST BE THE CLINCHER AT TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN GRAND 
RIGHT THIS IS PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
I LIKED IT THE OUTSIDE OF IT WAS VERY PRESENTABLE 
I LIKED IT COS IT WAS DETACHED 
IN THE MASTER BEDROOM I DID LIKE THE EN SUITE THAT WAS A NICE TOUCH 
YEAH IT WAS A NICE TOUCH THE ONLY DOWNSIDE PROBABLY WAS THE FRONT ROOM WAS SMALL 
AND THE GARDEN WAS A BIT SMALL AS WELL 
THAT WAS PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
IT WAS NICE YEAH VERY WELL PRESENTED 
LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN LOVED THERE'S QUITE A DROP IN THE BACK GARDEN 
IT LOOKS ON QUITE EVEN GROUND FROM THE FRONT BUT WHEN YOU GO OUT INTO THE BACK THERE WAS QUITE A DROP 
DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM 
THAT WAS HANDY 
AGAIN WHICH WAS SOMETHING WE WANTED YOU COULD MOVE STRAIGHT INTO IT 
YEAH YOU COULD YEAH STRAIGHT IN 
THAT WAS NUMBER TWO SHALL WE TRY NUMBER THREE YEAH SURE 
IT NEEDS UPDATING DOESN'T IT YEAH 
YOU'VE GOTTA TRY AND SEE PAST THAT FURNITURE 
IT AIN'T BAD IT IS LIVEABLE BUT I KNOW YOUR TASTES AND I KNOW YOU'D LIKE TO CHANGE IT 
THAT WOULD BE QUITE A GOOD SPACE FOR AMBER IT WOULD 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON WELL

BEFORE WE SEND YOU IN THERE TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY SENT IN THEIR 
VERY OWN SURVEYOR TO GIVE THE HOUSE A ONCE OVER ON YOUR BEHALF 
THIS IS NOT A LEGALLY BINDING SURVEY AND WHENEVER YOU GO TO BUY A NEW PROPERTY 
GET A FULL STRUCTURAL SURVEY CARRIED OUT 
HOWEVER HE HAS RAISED ONE OR TWO INTERESTING POINTERS 
THERE ARE ONLY MINOR THINGS HERE BECAUSE 
IT'S QUITE A NEW BUILD HOUSE SO HE HASN'T FOUND ANYTHING STRUCTURAL 
ONE OF THEM IS THE LEYLANDII AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN THEY'RE NOT ON YOUR SIDE OF THE FENCE 
THEY BELONG TO NEIGHBOURS AND HE SAYS JUST MAKE SURE THEY'RE ALWAYS KEPT DOWN TO A MINIMUM HEIGHT 
THERE WAS SO NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS HOUSE HE EVEN SAID 
OH AND THERE'S SOME CRACKED TILES ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR THAT'S IT 
SO BASICALLY LAY SOME NEW TILES 
BUT JUST MAKE SURE YOU USE THE RIGHT GROUT OR LAY SOME VINYL FLOORING 
THAT IS THE SIZE OF THE STORY 
GO IN THERE DO YOUR TEST DRIVE AND LOOK AFTER EACH OTHER TAKE CARE

UP IN THE NURSERY AMBER IS TRYING THE MOBILE FOR SIZE 
AND THERE'S ANOTHER HIT WITH DARREN THE PUNCH BALL THAT IS AND THE WEIGHTS DOES THAT MAN EVER STOP 
DARREN'S STILL GOT ENOUGH ENERGY TO FEED AMBER
