HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE ONE SHOW 
WITH CHRISTINE BLEAKLEY AND ADRIAN 
CHILES AND SIR TIM RICE IS WITH US 
HOW YOU NICE TO HAVE YOU HERE FRPL 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHE CRICKET 
FAN SOMEONE WHO IS HOPING TO BOWL 
HIM OVER IS FUF PHIL TUFNELL WE 
ARE UNDER THE MEDICAL SUPERVISION 
OF THE TEAM DOCTOR SAVAR JARVIS 
FRPL JOIN ME AS THE ONE SHOW GETS 
THE FIRST LOOK AT BIGGEST CRUISE 
LINER MANY OF US USE MORE THAN 
COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE SOME OF IT 
IS KNOWN TO WORK SOME OF IT IS NOT 
THOUGHT TO BE WORK BUT WHEN IT 
COMES TO HOMEOPATHY THE JURY IS 
STILL OUT THE ONE SHOW DOCTOR 
TAKES A LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE FOR 
AND AGAINST 
THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND HOMEOPATHY 
BEGAN IN ANCIENT GREECE BUT IT 
WASN'T UNTIL THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY BUT 
IT WASN'T UNTIL THE EIGHTEENTH 
OF LIKE CURING LIKE U. SO YOU TAKE 
SOMETHING LIKE AN ONION THAT WOULD 
NORMALLY CAUSE WRUN RUNNY NOSE 
AND EYES AND YOU USE IT TO TREAT IT 
THE DIFFERENCE IS YOU TAKE THE OWN 
I DON'T KNOW AND DILUTE IT SO MANY 
TIMES THERE IS NOT A SINGLE 
MOLECULE OF THE ORIGINAL ONION LEFT 
IN THE REMEDY BUT IF THERE IS NO 
ONION LEFT HOW CAN IT WORK AFTER 
EACH DILUTION WITH WATER THE 
REMEDY IS GIVEN A CALIBRATED AMOUNT 
OF SHAKING HOMEOPATHS BELIEVE IT 
IMPRINTS THE HEALING ENERGY OF THE 
SUBSTANCE IN THE WATER SO THAT THE 
WATER ITSELF CONTAINS A HEALRY 
MEMORY I HAVE TO SAY AS A DOCTOR I 
FIND THE IDEA OF HOMEOPATHY 
UNCONVINCING IN FACT I THINK ITS 
SUCCESS IS DOWN TO THE PLACEBO 
EFFECT THE TIME AND EFFORT THEY 
TAKE WITH THE PATIENT 
PROBABLY IF 
YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHAT YOU LIKE 
TO TELL ME 
LIKE ME SARAH TRAINED 
AS A G. P. ELEVEN YEARS AGO SHE BECAME A 
FULL TIME HOMEOPATH L. ASKED HER 
ABOUT THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT THE THE THEORY IS WATER HAS A MEMORY HOW 
DOES THAT WORK YES I THINK THAT IS 
A CONFUSINGFB YOU DON'T KNOW HOW 
HOMEOPATHIC REMEDYS ARE MADE THEY 
ARE PREPARED IN A CAREFUL WAY IN A 
SERIES OF DILUTIONS AND WE THINK IT 
IS THAT PROCESS OF DILUTING AND 
SHAKING DILUTING AGAIN AND SHAKING 
WHICH TRANSFERS THE INFORMATION 
INTO THE REMEDY 
NOW IF YOU ARE 
CONFIDENT ABOUT THE HEALING POWERS 
OF HOMEOPATHY WHY ARE THERE NO 
RELIABLE CLINICAL STUDIES 
I DON'T 
THINK THAT IS TRUE THERE HAVE BEEN 
OVER ONE HUNDRED TRIALS AND SOME SHOW 
POSITIVE RESULTS OR TRENDS THERE 
IS MORE EVIDENCE FROM LABORATORIES 
NOW SUGGESTING THAT REMEDIES DO 
HAVE SOME SORT OF PHYSIOLOGICAL 
ACTIVITY 
WE KNOW ABOUT THE PLACEBO ACTIVITY EFFECT IS THERE ANYTHING MORE TO 
HOMEOPATHY TO THE TIME AN 
COUNSELLING SIDE 
ALL TREATMENTS 
HAVE AN ELEMENT THAT IS DUE DUE 
TO THE PRACTITIONER AND HOMEOPATHY 
IS NO DIFFERENT L. BELIEVE IT IS 
MORE THAN HAVING A NICE 
CONSULTATION WITH PEOPLE 
ONE OF THE ISSUES I HAVE IS THAT IT 
IS NOT REGULATED ANYBODY CAN WALK 
IN OFF THE STREET PUT UP THEIR 
PLAQUE AND SAY I AM A HOMEOPATH 
HOW CAN SOMEONE KNOW THEY ARE 
GETTING QUALIFIED ONE 
THE BODY I 
BELONG TO HAS A LIST OF REGISTERED 
PRACTITIONER SO IF PEOPLE HAVE A 
SERIOUS MEDICAL CONDITION I WOULD 
ADVICE THEM TO APPROACH THAT 
ORGANISATION ORGANISATION SARAH OBVIOUSLY BELIEVES IN WHAT 
SHE DOES BUT FOR ME UNTIL 
HOMEOPATHY IS SUBJECTED TO PROPER 
TRIAL IT WILL REMAIN JUST THE 
PLACEBO PLACEBO ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW YOU ARE COMING 
FROM THE CONVENTIONAL ROUTE BUT SO 
DID THAT DOCTOR AS WELL AND SHE 
HAS GONE FOR THE HOMEOPATHIC ROUTE 
WHO 
IS RIGHT AND WHO IS WRONG SHE SHE IS AND SHE WAS INTERESTED IN THE 
WHOLE IDEA SHE SAID SHE WAS 
INTERESTED IN THE IDEA OF 
INTEGRATED MEDICINE SO SHE 
PRACTICES BOTH JOU A LOT OF TIME 
WITH THE PATIENT AND THAT IS A LUCK 
SURELY WE DON'T HAVE 
SHE WANTED TO 
SEE A RESULT AT THE END O. IT SO IT 
HAS TO WORK 
I AM NOT SURE THAT IS 
TRUE THE WHOLE PROCESS WORKS WHAT 
I HAVE A PROBLEM IS WHETHER IT IS 
THE TIME YOU SPEND WITH THE PATIENT 
THE TIME YOU SPEND TALKING TO THEM 
THE TIME YOU SPEND TEASING OUT 
THEIR PROBLEMS OR WHETHER IT IS THE 
TABLET 
DOES IT DO IT FOR YOU DO TABLET YOU EVER USE THAT RESCUE REMEDY ON 
YOUR TONGUE 
YOU WOULD BE HARD 
PUSHED TO FIND A SUBJECT ABOUT 
WHICH I KNOW LESS MY INSTINCT IS 
TO TRUST REGULAR DOCTORS 
YOU TALK 
ABOUT THE TIME FACTOR THERE AND 
THE COUNSELS ASPECT AND WE CAN'T 
GET THAT ALWAYS FROM OUR G. P.'S SO 
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE WANT 
TO BELIEVE L. L. CAN UNDERSTAND IT AND 
I THINK IF PEOPLE WANT TO USE IT 
SIDE BY SIDE THAT IS JUST FINE I 
HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH IT BECAUSE IT 
IS COMPLETELY SAFE SO AT WORST IT 
IS A SAFE COUNSELLING SESSION BUT 
BUT IT IS ALL TO DO WITH THE 
DECLINE OF RELIGION 
DO YOU THINK 
SO MOST THINGS ARE A LESS CHAR 
TABL OPINION IS THEY DON'T BELIEVE 
IN MAINSTREAM MEDICINE THEY THINK 
THERE IS ANOTHER ANSWER OUT THERE 
IT IS DEEPLY PEOPLE ARE CYNICAL 
AND WOULD RATHER GO FOR THIS THAT THAT IS RIGHT WE CAN'T ALWAYS HELP BUT 
DON'T FORGET I NEVER PRESCRIBE A 
MEDICINE UNLESS IT IS LICENSED AND 
IT IF IS IT IS PROVEN TO HELP IT 
HAS GONE THROUGH INCREDIBLY 
RIGOROUS TRIALS WHICH HERBAL 
REMEDIES AND HOMEOPATHY DON'T HAVE 
TO GO TO 
HAVE YOU EVER DABBLED AT 
ALL IN THIS FIELD YOU ARE SAYING 
YOU 
DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT I I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
ACUPUNCTURE I HAVE TRYED THAT THAT THAT IS A DIFFERENT FORM 
I KNOW NOTHING 
ABOUT IT 
THEY GET LUMPED TOGETHER 
SO YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK IT IT KIND OF WORKED IT WAS RELAXING IT 
WAS A NICE WAY TO SPEND HALF AN 
HOUR 
WE WILL STOP TORTURING YOU HOUR ABOUT STUFF YOU KNOW LITTLE ABOUT 
WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT MUSICALS 
AND CRICKETS ON TUESDAY THOUSANDS

OF OTHER LINES HAVING HIGH PROFILE 
LAUNCHES AND THE PASSENGER SHIPPING 
ASSOCIATION SAID THIS YEAR THERE IS 
ONE POINT FIVE FIVE MILLION BRITS EXPECTED TO 
CREWS WHICH IS A FOURTEEN PER CENT INCREASE ON 
LAST YEAR SO IT IS ON THE UP QUITE QUITE A NUMBER WHY IS IT IS POPULAR 
BECAUSE IT HAS EVERYTHING AND THE 
LINERS ARE PUTTING MONEY INTO 
INNOVATION THEY WANT TO ATTRACT 
THE FAMILIES

ELDERLY IMAGE IS THE AVERAGE AGE 
COMING DOWN

SHIP LIKE THIS MANY IS THE SUMMER

I THINK IT 
DOES YOU GET TO SEE THE 
MEDITERRANEAN ON A GREAT PRICE NOW NOW THIS SHIP IS NOR NOUS ENORMOUS 
IS THIS AS BIG AS IT IS GOING TO 
GET WHAT IS THE FUTURE 
THIS IS 
THE BIGGEST AND IT IS THE BIGGEST 
FOR A SHIP TO BE IN SOUTHAMPTON 
BUT THEY ARE GETTING BIGGER ROYAL 
CARIBBEAN IS DOING IT WITH PROJECT 
GENESIS 
BACK TO THE STUDIO FROM GENESIS SOUTHAMPTON SOUTHAMPTON CAROL THATCHER THANK YOU WOULD 
YOU FANCY TAKING TO THE SEAS WITH 
ONE THOUSAND CHILDREN DOES THAT APPEAL I I THINK SHE WAS I WAS WITH HER ALL 
THE WAY UNTIL SHE MENTIONED ONE THOUSAND 
CHILDREN I LIKE CRUISING BUT THERE 
HAS TO BE ABOUT TWELVE PEOPLE BUT IF 
CAROL IS ONBOARD I WOULD GO 
A MAN 
OFURE MEANS COULD CHARTER THAT BOAT 
FOR YOU 
THE BEST THING ABOUT THAT 
CLIP WAS THE TRACK BIG SHIP BUT IS 
AN OBSCURE HIT AND I WAS ON THAT 
SESSION AS HIS PRODUCERS' 
ASSISTANT I MADE THE COFFEE L. 
USED TO WORK FOR HIS OFFICE AND 
THAT WAS ONE OF OUR RECORDS WE WE HAVE A PIECE ABOUT A SONG L. AM 
SURE THIS IS ONE YOU DO KNOW L. 
HAVEN'T HEARD OF THIS BUT IT IS A 
SONG ABOUT A DAY TRIP TO THE HORSE 
RACES AT BLAYDON IF YOU ARE A 
FOOTBALL FAN YOU PROBABLY HAVE 
HEARD OF IT IF YOU ARE LIKE ME YOU 
PROBABLY HAVE NEWCASTLE UNITED 
FANS HAVE BEEN SINGING ABOUT THE 
BLAYDON RACES FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
WHY GOOD QUESTION MYLEENE HAS AN 
ANSWER FOR US IT'S A SONG CALLED 
THE UNOFFICIAL ANTHEM OF TYNESIDERS 
SPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF 
THE TOON ARMY 
IS THE ANTHEM IF YOU LIKE IT IS 
THE ONE SONG WHERE EVERYONE IS 
UNIFIED AND GIVING IT EVERYTHING 
AND THE HAIRS ON THE BACK OF OF 
YOUR NECK STAND UP WHO WHY DO YOU 
THINK IT HAS STAYING POW SNER IT 
IS SOONG FROM YESTERDAY AND WE 
CRAVE SOMETIMES TO GO BACK TO THE 
OLD WAYS PEOPLE WERE JUMPING UP 
AND DOWN SINGING THE BLAYDON RACES 
I BLEED BLACK AND WHITE L. HAVE A 
WIFE AND DAUGHTER BUT COMING IN 
SECOND IS NEWCASTLE UNITED WORDS 
CAN HARDLY EXPRESS WHAT THE SONG 
MEANS TO ME 
I WENT TO BLAYDON RACES 
IT WAS ON THE NINTH JUNE 
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY TWO ON A SUMMER'S AFTERNOON 
WE TOOK THE BUS FROM BUSINESSMAN 
BRASS GAN A LONG THE SCOTSWOOD 
ROAD ROAD TO SEE THE BLADEN RACES 
THE ORIGINS OF THE SONG DATE BACK 
TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WHEN GEORDIE 
RID LY PUT NEW WORDS TO AN OLD TUNE 
THE SONG TELLS A STORY FROM THE 
CENTRE OF KNEW CASTLE TO THE 
BLAYDON RACES THE THE EVENTS ARE 
MADE UP BUT HE INCLUDE REAL PLACES 
AND PEOPLE LIKE THIS ONE TIME MUSIC 
HALL 
HE WAS A MINER WHO HAD A BAD HALL ACCIDENT AND HAD TO RELY UPON HIS 
MUSIC WRITING SKILLS FOR HIS LIVING 
AND FOR A SHORT TIME HE HAD SOME 
LOCAL CELEBRITY BUT HE DIED THIS THIS IS THE MOST FAMOUS SONG 
HE HAD 
ANOTHER ONE CALLED CURBY 
BUTTERFIELD HE MANAGED TO GET TWO 
FAMOUS SONGS 
I WENT TO BLAYDON RACES 
IT WAS ON NINTH JUNE 
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY TWO ON A SUMMER'S AFTERNOON 
ALL THE LADS AND LASSES THERE 
ALL HAD SMILING FACES 
GANEN A LONG THE SCOTSWOOD ROAD 
TO SEE THE BLAYDON RACES 
TO ADD EXCITE TOMENT THE SONG HE 
INVENTED AN ACCIDENT THAT AGAIN HE 
USED REAL NAMES AND PLACES THE 
WHEEL CAME OFF BEFORE THE BRIDGE 
THERE AND THEY HAD TO TAKE A LOT OF 
THEM BACK TO THE EYE INFIRMARY 
WHICH IS BACK ALONG SCOTSWOOD ROAD 
SO IT WAS BAD ACCIDENT 
YES BUT 
THERE WERE LOTS OF PUBS ROUND THERE 
FORTY FOUR I AM TOLD 
SO THEY MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN MERRY 
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS 
THE MAIN APPEAL WHY DO THEY LOVE 
THIS SONG 
IT PUTS US ON THE MAP 
IF YOU TELL SOMEBODY YOU ARE FROM 
BLAYDON THEY START TO SING AT YOU 
AND PEOPLE LOVE IT 
I AM GOING TO 
BLOW AWAY 
THE RACES WERE RUN ON AN ISLAND IN 
THE TYNE AND AN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY TWO HEAVILY I 
HAVE RAIN STOPPED THE HORSES 
GETTING ACROSS AN EVENT HE 
INCORPORATED INTO HIS SONG BLAYDON 
RACES CONTINUED UNTIL NINETEEN SIXTEEN WHEN 
THEY CAME TO A STEK SPECTACULAR 
END 
DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR THEY END GOT A SPECIAL LICENSE TO HOLD THE 
RACES FOR THE LAST TIME BUT ENDED 
UP IN A RIOT AND THE GRANDSTAND 
WAS B. BURNED DOWN WHICH I THINK WAS 
CAUSED WHEN THE FAVOURITE WAS 
DISQUALIFIED 
WHY DO YOU THINK IT DISQUALIFIED IS THE UNOFFICIAL ANTHEM OF THE 
NORTH EAST 
I THINK IT TYPIFYS PART 
OF THE GEORDIE CULTURE SO WELL 
SIMILARLY THE SONG WUZ WHICH HAS 
BITS OF DISASTER ABOUT THE BUS 
WHEEL FLYING OFF AND THE RAIN 
POURING DOWN ALL THE DAY SO THINGS 
NEVER QUITE WORK OUT PROPERLY BUT 
IT IS A BIT LIKE SUPPORTERS OF 
NEWCASTLE UNITED YOU HOPE FOR THE 
BEST WHEN YOU GO THERE BUT IT 
DOESN'T END UP THAT WAY 
BUT YOU 
SMILE THERE THROUGH IT 
HOW DID YOU END UP SUPPORTING 
SUNDERLAND 
WHEN I WAS ABOUT EIGHT SUNDERLAND EVERYBODY AT SCHOOL HAD A TEAM 
MOST PEOPLE HAD THE CLOSEST TEAMS 
LUTON WATFORD SOME OF THE LONDON 
SIDE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE SUPPORTED 
WOLVES BECAUSE THEY WERE THE 
CHAMPIONS THAT YEAR L. JUST LIKED 
THE NAME SUNDERLAND L. IMAGINED 
GOLDEN BEACHES PALM TREES 
IT IS 
JUST LIKE THAT 
I GOT HOOKED ON 
SUNDERLAND AFTER ABOUT THREE 
SATURDAYS AND THEN I REALISED IT 
WAS ABOUT AS FAR AWAY AS I COULD 
HAVE CHOSEN BUT I AM ON THE BOARD 
OF THEIR CHARITABLE FOUNDATION I I HAVE GOT SOME THINK CRICKET BALLS 
WE WILL REFER TO THESE LATER 
SO THE NUTCRACKER A BEAUTIFUL 
PIECE PUTTING WORDS TO TCHAIKOVSKY 
CANNOT BE EASY 
YES THAT IS A 
MOVIE COMING OUT SOME TIME LATER 
THIS YEAR IT IS A RETELLING OF THE 
NUTCRACKER STORY IN A SPECIAL 
EFFECTS TYPE FILM L. WAS ASKED TO 
WRITE SOME SONGS WITH TCHAIKOVSKY 
HE IS GREAT TO WRITE WITH BECAUSE 
HE NEVER RINGS UP 
NEVER COMPLAINS 
IT IS OBVIOUSLY NOT WRITING EXACTLY 
TO TCHAIKOVSKY 
THE RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE MUSICIANS DO THEY LOOK 
DOWN ON THE LYRICISTS 
NOT AS MUCH 
AS WE LOOKED DOWN ON THE COMPOSER'S 
IF YOU ARE GOING TO WORK WITH A 
COMPOSER AND IT IS GOING TO BE 
SUCCESSFUL YOU HAVE TO LIKE AND 
RESPECT WHAT HE DOES AND VICE 
VERSA 
DO THE WORDS STILL COME VERSA EASILY OR DO THEY GET HARDER IT IT IS THE SAME IF YOU ARE 
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE IDEA IT IS 
EASY IF YOU ARE NOT AND IF YOU 
ARE A HIRED HAND SOMETIMES YOU CAN 
THINK I DO NOT WANT TO DO THIS 
THEN IT IS DIFFICULT BUT IF YOU 
ARE INVOLVED AND YOU GET INTO IT 
IT CAN BE EASY 
YOU FAMOUSLY WROTE 
THE LYRICS TO JOSEPH WHAT DO YOU 
THINK OF LEE MEAD 
HE IS VERY GOOD 
MARVELLOUS AND HE GETS BETTER L. 
HAVE ONLY SEEN THE SHOW WITH HIM 
ABOUT THREE TIMES AND HERE HE IS 
INTERRUPTING ME L. HAVE GONE OFF HIM 
HE DID GO THROUGH THE WARS TO HIM GET THERE SO I SUPPOSE HE DESERVES 
IT IT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT METHOD OF 
CHOOSING A CAST 
VERY WELL KNOWN 
MUSICAL IT WORKS IT WORKS REALLY 
WELL AS TELEVISION YOU GET HOOKED 
INTO IT IT IS FINE L. DISAGREE 
COMPLETELY WITH ALL OF THIS GARBAGE 
ABOUT IT BEING A HUMILIATING THESE 
PEOPLE WANT TO BE ON TELEVISION AND 
MOST OF THEM ARE PRETTY GOOD IF 
THEY DO NOT WIN MOST OF THEM GET 
PARTS ELSEWHERE 
DOES IT FEEL TWENTY TWO 
YEARS SINCE CHESS CAME OUT 
YOU ARE 
JUMPING AROUND A BIT WHAT ARE YOU 
ON NO IT FEELS LIKE TWENTY FOUR YEARS IT 
IS TWENTY FOUR YEARS SINCE CHESS 
I AM SURE 
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN US 
THE SHOW 
CAME OUT IN EIGHTY SIX AND THE RECORD CAME 
OUT AND EIGHTY FOUR WE ARE DOING A BIG 
CONCERT AT THE ALBERT HALL ON MAY 
TWELFTH AND MAY THIRTEENTH 
GOING BACK TO 
THE ORIGINAL GREAT SONG 
TERRIFYING HAIRCUTS 
IN THE END HE NEEDS LITTLE BIT 
MORE THAN BEFORE 
UP SECURITY 
HE NEEDS HIS FANTASY AND FREEDOMS 
I KNOW HIM SO WELL 
WHAT IS THIS PERFORMANCE ABOUT AT 
THE ALBERT HALL 
IT IS A CONCERT 
VERSION OF CHESS IT STARS THE 
WOMAN WHO PLAYED THE LEAD IN WICKED 
IN LONDON AND BROADWAY L. WAS QUITE 
KEEN TO DO IT AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY 
INTENDED JUST IN OPERATIC FORM IT 
IS A BIG CHOIR BIG ORCHESTRA 
THINGS YOU CANNOT DO IN A THEATRE 
WE WILL GET ON TO THE CRICKET SHORT 
LEAVE I CAN REVEAL THAT CHRISTINE 
WILL BE PADDING UP AS TUFFERS IS 
WAITING TO SEE IF HE CAN BOWL US 
OUT FRESH EYE AND I CAN'T WAIT 
WHILE WE GET READY FOR THAT LET'S 
SEE WHAT HAPPENED WHEN TUFFERS WENT 
TO PATTINGHAM IN STAFFORDSHIRE TO 
SEE IF OUR ARTS PSYCHOLOGIST COULD 
WORK OUT THE HIDDEN EXPRESSIONS 
FROM THE PAINTINGS OF FLORIST 
CALLED THE JAM FLORIST CALLED JAN JAN I AM IN THE VILLAGE OF PATTINGHAM 
TODAY HOME OF ONE OF OUR VIEWERS 
JANUARY SHE IS MUM OF TWO GROWN UP 
CHILDREN SHE WENT TO UNIVERSITY AS 
A MATURE STUDENT TO STUDY TEXTILES 
AND IS ALSO A FLORIST L. HAVE 
ARRANGED TO HAVE THREE PIECES OF 
HER FAVOURITE ARTWORK TAKEN FROM 
HER HOME AND DISPLAYED IN THE LOCAL 
VILLAGE HALL FOR TOMAS TO TAKE 
LOOK AT TOMAS IS COMPLETELY IN THE 
DARK ABOUT WHO THE ART WORK BELONGS 
TO THE PICTURES ARE HIS ONLY CLUES 
WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE PUT THEM IN A 
NEUTRAL LOCATION 
THE FIRST ONE IS 
A POST IMPRESSIONIST PAINTING IT 
HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE NORMALLY 
PEOPLE WHO LIKE IMPRESSIONIST ART 
TEND TO BE AGREEABLE AND FRIENDLY 
IF THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE 
PAINTINGS IT IS A SIGN OF 
SOCIABILITY IT IS NOT QUITE 
IMPRESSIONIST BUT QUITE MODERN 
THERE IS AN INFLUENCE OF CUBISM 
WHICH SHOWS HIGH CREATIVITY AT THE 
MOMENT I WOULD SAY SOMEBODY 
AGREEABLE EXTROVERTED AND CREATIVE 
THE SECOND PICTURE IS ONE THAT WAS 
PICKED UP AT A STUDENT ART SHOW 
OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO 
WHAT YOU CAN SEE 
HERE IS THAT IT IS SOMEBODY A 
LITTLE BIT CHILDISH FRIENDLY AND 
QUITE HUMOROUS AND POSSIBLY WE ARE 
LOOKING AT A WOMAN RATHER THAN A 
MAN BASED ON THESE PAINTINGS 
SOMETHING BIT DIFFERENT HERE IT IT IS ACTUALLY INSIDE AS WELL THE THE THIRD PIECE IS A LIMITED EDITION 
CANVAS PRINT BY A DUTCH ARTIST WE WE CAN STILL SEE THE PATTERNS THAT I 
HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE 
FRIENDLINESS SOCIABILITY AND A 
WARM WELCOMING QUITE CHILDISH 
PAINTING THAT THEY CHOSE 
WHAT DO 
YOU RECKON SHE DOES FOR A LIVING 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WOULD SAY 
SOMEBODY CREATIVE THERE IS LOT 
OF MODERN ART AND QUITE 
COSMOPOLITAN WE HAVE HOLLAND 
FRANCE AND ENGLAND REPRESENTED 
WOULD SAY TO SOMEBODY WHO LOOKS 
AFTER HER FAMILY PERHAPS A 
HOUSEWIFE IN HER MID THIRTIES 
MID FORTIES EARLY FIFTIES 
IT SOUNDS 
GOOD TO ME BUT WILL JAN AGREE OR 
DISAGREE WITH TOMAS'S OPINIONS 
THIS IS MY FAVOURITE BIT HELLO HELLO NICE TO MEET YOU 
ARE YOU READY TO 
HEAR YOUR PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE 
YES 
THE FIRST PICTURE WE LOOK TURK YES WAS THE POST IMPRESSIONIST ONE AND 
I THOUGHT THAT BELONGED TO SOMEBODY 
WHO WAS VERY EXTROVERTED CREATIVE 
FUN AND SOCIABLE SOMEBODY QUITE 
AGREEABLE IS THAT RIGHT 
YES IT 
IS DEFINITELY 
THE SECOND PICTURE 
WAS THE SWIMMING POOL AND I THOUGHT 
THE MAIN COMPONENT WAS THAT IT WAS 
QUITE NAIVE ALMOST A BIT CHILDISH 
IT BELONGED TO SOMEBODY WHO DOES 
NOT TAKE ITSELF VERY SERIOUSLY 
BASICALLY IS THAT CORRECT VERY VERY TRUE 
THE THIRD ONE THE MOST TRUE INTERESTING AND REVEALING WAS THE 
COWS I THOUGHT THAT BELONGED TO 
SOMEBODY WHO IS VERY HUMOROUS ALSO 
BECAUSE WE HAD A FRENCH PAINTING AT 
THE BEGINNING AN ENGLISH PAINTING 
SECOND AND A DUTCH ONE I THOUGHT 
THIS WAS A PERSON WHO WAS QUITE 
INTERNATIONAL QUITE COSMOPOLITAN 
WOULD YOU AGREE 
YES I DO NOT TO 
TRAVEL AND SEE NEW PLACES 
I SAID 
IT WAS PROBABLY A WOMAN IN HER MID 
FORTIES THE EARLY FIFTIES BUT I COULD 
NOT WORK OUT WHAT YOU DO L. SAID HOUSEWIFE 
HOUSEWIFE I WOULD NOT BE HOUSEWIFE THAT IS AS FAR FROM THE TRUTH AS 
YOU COULD GET AND MY FAMILY WILL 
CONFIRM THAT 
WHAT DO YOU DO L. I HAVE SOME FLOWER SHOPS AN EARLY DAY 
VERY BUSY LIFESTYLES WITH THAT L. 
AM ALSO A PAINTER SO I SPEND 
SUNDAYS IN MY STUDIO PAINTING WHAT WHAT DO YOU PAINT DEALER MOSTLY 
LANDSCAPES AND MOSTLY EUROPEAN SO SO SHE HAS AN ARTIST WE DID NOT SEE 
THAT COMING L. L. WILL LEAVE TOMAS 
LOOKING AT SOME OF HER WORK NEXT 
TIME SOMEONE ASKS YOU WHAT ART WORK 
YOU LIKE ON YOUR WALLS REMEMBER TO 
ANSWER CAREFULLY BECAUSE A PICTURE 
REALLY IS WORTH A ONE THOUSAND WORDS 
I KNOW A SONG ABOUT THAT DOCTOR TOMAS 
DID NOT GET IT QUITE RIGHT 
NO BUT 
SHE WAS ACTUALLY AN ARTIST HERSELF 
BUT IT WAS NOT BAD 
WHAT IS YOUR 
VIEW ON THE PINK 
IT IS FOR 
THE ONE DAY GAME BECAUSE AFTER 
ABOUT THIRTY FIVE OVERS THEY HAVE TO CHANGE 
THE WHITE BALL 
BUT IT 
IS PINK IT IT IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT ONE OF MY 
CRICKET TEAM'S COLOURS IS PINK HAS HAS IT GIVEN YOU MORE JOY THAN 
HEARTACHE OVER THE YEARS
