HELLO AGAIN WE HAVE REACHED THE 
QUARTER FINALS STAGE OF THIS 
EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT C. O. M. WORLD SNOOKER CHAMPIONSHIP 
AND IN SNOOKER 
EXTRA WE 
ARE GOING 
TO 
FEATURE THE 
MATCH BETWEEN 
TO FEATURE THE MATCH BETWEEN STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE WHO 
WON 
TWO MAJOR TITLES 
THIS SEASON 
AND JOE 
PERRY WHOSE 
CAREER 
IS VERY 
MUCH ON THE UP AGAIN HE HAS JUST 
QUALIFIED TO GET BACK 
ELITE TOP 
THIRD 
TIME IN 
HIS CAREER 
IT 
MAN FROM 
CAMBRIDGESHIRE WHO TOOK THE OPENING 
FRAME WE'RE 
GOING TO JOIN THEM IN 
FRAME WE'RE GOING TO JOIN THEM IN THE SECOND 
COMMENTARY COMES FROM 
DENNIS TAYLOR AND TERRY GRIFFITHS 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE BREAKS OFF IN THE 
SECOND FRAME A HIGH BREAK OF TWELVE IN 
THE FIRST FRAME 
HE HAS A SHOT 
THE FIRST FRAME TO NOTHING FOR JOE PERRY BELIEVE 
IT OR NOT 
YES HE PLAYED IT WELL HE'S GOING 
TO 
STRUGGLE TO 
KEEP 
THE SIDE OF THE BAULK LINE HE HAS 
POTTED BROWN ON INTO THE CENTRE IT 
ALL DEPENDS HOW AGGRESSIVE HE FEELS 
AT THIS STAGE HE HAS GOT A BROWN 
ON HE PLAYED FOR THE RED 
TO THE 
LEFT 
OFF THE PACK MAINLY BECAUSE THE 
BLACK IS 
ONLY AVAILABLE INTO THE 
RIGHT CORNER 
HE PLAYED VERY SLOWLY TO HOLD FOR 
THE BLACK HE HAS JUST ABOUT GOT IT 
FOR ONE MINUTE IT LOOKED AS IF HE 
HAD SLIPPED PAST THAT RED 
JUST A LITTLE BIT SHORT OF PACE 
BUT HE SHOULD BE O. K. WHEN RUNNING 
THROUGH JUST 
NUDGE A 
RED AND GET 
ON THE BLACK DOESN'T HAVE TO GO 
BACK INTO THE REDS HERE BUT HE CAN 
PLAY A LITTLE STUN SHOT BETWEEN THE 
REDS 
ON THE 
RIGHT SIDE OF THE TABLE 
HE HAS LEFT HIMSELF A CHOICE OF THE 
REDS 
JOE PERRY WHO BEAT FORMER WORLD 
CHAMPION GRAEME DOTT IN THE FIRST 
ROUND AND STUART BINGHAM IN THE 
LAST SIXTEEN 
TO GET TO 
THIS 
STAGE HE 
HAS BEEN 
IN THE QUARTER FINAL ONCE 
HAS BEEN IN THE QUARTER FINAL ONCE BEFORE STEPHEN MAGUIRE OF COURSE 
IS THE FAVOURITE TO WIN THE 
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN A LOT THERE 
HAVE BEEN MANY PLAYERS BEFORE 
STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE WHO 
HAVE FOUND JOE 
PERRY A TOUGH PROPOSITION HE IS 
GOOD IN ALL DEPARTMENTS A LITTLE 
MORE RELAXED NOW THAT HE HAS 
REGAINED HIS TOP SIXTEEN PLACE THIS YEAR 
IT IS ONE LESS THING TO THINK ABOUT 
JAN VERHAAS THERE JUST SAYING GIVE 
ME A SECOND JOE HE HAS A 
SPOT TO FIND FOR THE PINK THERE IT 
IS RIGHT AT THE BACK OF THE RED 
BUT ROB WALKER OUR M. C. INTRODUCES 
JOE PERRY AS GENTLEMAN JOE THIS IS 
A GOOD START FOR THE GENTLEMEN HERE 
ISN'T IT 
I DIDN'T SEE HIM BOWING 
AFTER HE WON THE FIRST FRAME YOU 
CAN LOOK AT THINGS TWO WAYS I 
SUPPOSE THE FIRST ROUND WAS PRETTY 
AWFUL IF JOE WINS THIS ONE AT THIS 
VISIT IT WILL SETTLE HIM DOWN IN 
HIS QUARTER FINAL LIKE ALL THESE 
PLAYERS THEY COME IN OFF A WIN IN 
THE PREVIOUS ROUND AND THEY LIKE TO 
KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING AND START 
WELL ANOTHER DAY ANOTHER OPPONENT 
HERE AT THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS 
THERE IS SUCH A LONG TIME YOU ARE 
OUT THERE PLAYING SEVENTEEN DAYS YOU ARE 
NOT GOING TO BE PLAYING EVERY DAY 
BUT SOMETIMES IT SEEMS LIKE SEVENTEEN 
WEEKS DENNIS DOESN'T IT 
YES JOE 
DID GO HOME AFTER HIS FIRST ROUND 
AND RELAXED AT HOME WITH HIS WIFE 
AND YOUNGSTER THAT WASN'T A BAD 
THING TO DO IT PROVED TO BE THE 
RIGHT DECISION BECAUSE HE IS 
PLAYING WELL AGAINST STUART BINGHAM 
HE PLAYED WELL AGAINST STUART 
BINGHAM AND TO BEAT STUART THIRTEEN NINE 
IT WAS A VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE YES YES HE WAS FIVE TO THREE DOWN AND HE LOST TWO 
FRAMES IN THE FIRST SESSION 
MAKING FIFTY BREAKS AND A GREAT CHANCE 
TO CLEAR UP SO HE DID WELL TO COME 
BACK FROM THERE 
I DON'T THINK HE'S GOT THE BREAK 
BUILDING THAT MAGUIRE OFFERS BUT 
NOT MANY HAVE 
YOU HAVE GOT TO PLAY A GOOD SAFETY 
GAME AS WELL AND PICK THE RIGHT 
SHOTS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY KEEP 
CONTROL OF YOUR MIND 
THERE IS A 
POSSIBLE SIXTY SEVEN ON THE TABLE SO 
WITHOUT A SNOOKER JOE PERRY IS TWO TO ZERO 
IN FRONT 
HE SHOULD FINISH IT OFF HERE THEN 
IF HE DOESN'T CLEAR UP HERE 
MAGUIRE WILL NOT BE COMING BACK 
FROM HIS CHAIR HE WILL BE 
WONDERING WHAT'S HIT HIM HERE 
MAGUIRE LOOKS CALM ENOUGH AT THE 
MOMENT IN HIS CHAIR WE HAVE SEEN 
ALREADY IN THE FIRST ROUND WHEN HE 
WAS HITTING THE TABLE HIS 
HEAD AND ALL 
THE 
THINGS THAT 
YOU DO WHEN YOU ARE FRUSTRATED OUT 
THERE 
YES THAT IS ENOUGH FOR JOE PERRY 
TO TAKE BOTH FRAMES 
MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAVE A GO AT THIS 
POT INTO THE RIGHT 
CORNER I 
THINK 
HE CAN FIND A GAP AROUND THE BLACK 
AND THE RED THERE ALTHOUGH LOOKING 
AT IT IF HE DOESN'T CATCH IT RIGHT 
HE COULD CANNON THE RED THAT IS 
WHY HE'S DIGGING DOWN A LITTLE BIT 
AND PROBABLY WHY HE MISSED THE POT 
BECAUSE HE CERTAINLY GOT THE CUE 
BALL DOWN THE BAULK AREA STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE ON FIVE THERE ON FIRE 
THERE 
HE IS LUKEWARM SO FAR JOE PERRY IS 
DOING ALL THE STUFF OUT THERE 
HE COULD HAVE AVOIDED A HAVING THE 
LITTLE SNAKE HE GOT ON THE BLUE 
THERE THAT 
HAS TAKEN 
THE CUE 
BALL 
AT LEAST 
A FOOT AWAY FROM THESE 
BALLS THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN L. 
THINK THE BLACK DOES GO IN THE 
CORNER 
HE HASN'T GOT A LOT OF ANGLE HE 
MAY 
HAVE TO RUN THROUGH HERE YOU YOU HAVE GOT TO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU ARE 
STRETCHING THAT POCKET CAN BE VERY 
UNCOMFORTABLE 
HE HAS HELD FOR THE PINK I DON'T 
THINK HE HAS GOT THE ANGLE AFTER 
POTTING THE PINK TO RUN THROUGH FOR 
THAT RED JUST ABOVE THE BLACK HE 
WILL HAVE TO HOLD FOR THE ONE BY 
HIS BRIDGE HAND AT THE TOP RIGHT 
OF THE PACK NOW THEN IF THE PINK 
PINK DOESN'T GO HAS HE GOT THE 
ANGLE THIS TIME TO PLAY FOR THE 
BLACK 
HE SCREWED BACK HE MUST BE TIGHT 
TO GET ON THAT BLACK 
IT LOOKS AS 
THOUGH HE HAS FINISH STRAIGHT ON 
THE PINK HE WILL HAVE TO LEAVE A 
RED AT THE PINK END OF THAT BUNCH 
OF REDS WHICH WILL BE A SLIGHTLY 
LONGER POT THAN HE WOULD HAVE 
WANTED 
ONCE AGAIN STRETCHING HE HAS TO 
WATCH THAT HE GETS THROUGH THE BALL 
HERE WHEN YOU STRETCH OUT IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO GET THE 
TIP THROUGH 
THE BALL ISN'T IT DENNIS YES YES THAT SAME POCKET IS IN THE WAY 
AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO START 
WEARING PROTECTION WHEN WE PLAY 
SNOOKER LIKE THEY DO AT CRICKET 
AFTER ALL THAT HE PLAYED THE SHOT 
EXCEPTIONALLY WELL VERY EARLY YET 
BUT THERE ARE SOME DANGER SIGNS OUT 
HERE FOR STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
THIS IS A BIT OF A SHOT FOR STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE WHEN YOU THINK HOW HE 
STARTED HIS MATCH AGAINST NEIL 
ROBERTSON YOU WAS WINNING ALL THE 
FRAMES NOW HE COULD QUITE EASILY 
DROP THREE TO ZERO BEHIND 
HE LOOKS VERY CONFIDENT OUT THERE 
THE FIRST TWO FRAMES WERE VERY 
DIFFERENT THE FIRST TOOK TWENTY SEVEN 
MINUTES THE SECOND TOOK JUST OVER 
EIGHT MINUTES 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE HE WAS SEVEN TO ZERO UP IN 
HIS FIRST ROUND MATCH AND HIS 
SECOND ROUND MATCH HE ACTUALLY 
WENT NINE TO ZERO UP HE BEAT ANTHONY 
HAMILTON IN THE FIRST ROUND AND 
LOOKED VERY IMPRESSIVE IN BOTH 
MATCHES SINCE THE FIRST FRAME HE 
HASN'T REALLY HAD ANY CHANCES 
BECAUSE JOE PERRY IS PLAYING 
IMMACULATE SNOOKER 
JUST SPOTTED SOMETHING ON THE CUE 
BALL THERE THAT WAS DISTRACTING HIM 
IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHEN JOE DID GET TO THE 
QUARTER FINAL HE HAD A TERRIFIC 
MATCH WITH MATTHEW STEVENS AND 
EVENTUALLY LOST THIRTEEN TO TEN SO HE HAS A 
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE HERE 
AT THE CRUCIBLE AND IT WILL STAND 
IN IN GOOD STEAD HE HAS GOT OFF TO 
THE PERFECT START THAT'S THE FRAME 
SAFE NOW THAT RED DISAPPEAR 
DISAPPEARED 
I MENTIONED THAT JOE WENT HOME IN 
BETWEEN FIRST AND SECOND ROUND AND 
SPENT A BIT OF TIME WITH HIS YOUNG 
DAUGHTER LEXY WHO IS EIGHTEEN MONTHS 
OLD THAT'S NOT A BAD WAY OF 
RELAXING IN BETWEEN MATCHES HE'S 
LOOKING VERY GOOD HERE 
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHEN JOE 
TURNED PROFESSIONAL HE USED TO 
PLAY EXHIBITIONS AT I USED TO 
PLAY EXHIBITIONS AT THE CLUB 
TO PLAY IT WHEN HE WAS AN AMATEUR 
TO BE FAIR HE HAS IMPROVED 
DRAMATICALLY OVER THE LAST SEVEN OR 
EIGHT SEASONS TERRY HE REALLY 
DOES PLAY THE GAME WELL DOESN'T 
HE 
IT HAS BEEN QUALITY ALL THE WAY HE HERE EXCELLENT CUE BALL CONTROL IS 
MAKING THIS LOOK VERY EASY 
HE HAS MADE TEN CENTURIES AT THE 
CRUCIBLE THEATRE HAS JOE 
THIS WILL BE HIS FOURTH CENTURY HERE 
AT THE CRUCIBLE THIS YEAR WELL 
DONE 
JOE PERRY JOE PERRY HAS HAD BREAKS OF SIXTY EIGHT AND 
THEN THAT MAGNIFICENT BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE 
AND HE NOW LEADS THREE TO ZERO 
HE WAS FORTY TO ZERO UP AT THE FIRST 
INTERVAL IN HIS FIRST TWO ROUNDS 
HE COULD BE FOUR ZERO DOWN THIS TIME 
HE WAS FOUR TO ZERO UP 
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE BUT STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE HASN'T POTTED BALL FOR 
ABOUT THIRTY ONE MINUTES AND THIS LOOKS 
VERY TIGHT 
LOOKING TO SEE IF THE RED WILL PAST 
THE PINK FOR HIS E. BOOKING TO SEE 
IF THERE IS A PLANT THERE TO THIS 
SIDE OF THE PINK OR IS HE 
LOOKING HE'S LOOKING TO SEE HOW 
CLOSE THE REDS ARE TOGETHER MUST BE TIGHT 
THERE IS STILL ONE HE CAN TAKE INTO 
THE RIGHT CORNER EVEN IF THAT ONE 
THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE WHITE ISN'T 
AVAILABLE THAT IS VERY TIGHT AND 
IT IS TOO THIN FOR THE MIDDLE 
NOW CAN STEPHEN MAGUIRE POPPED HIS 
FIRST BALL POT HIS FIRST BALL FOR 
COMING UP TO THIRTY THREE MINUTES 
YES THIRTY THREE 
MINUTES SOUNDS A LONG TIME BUT IF 
YOU ARE OUT THERE IN THE CHAIR FOR 
THAT 
LENGTH OF 
TIME WITHOUT POTTING 
A BALL IT SEEMS LIKE THREE HOURS 
THESE LADS ARE USED TO IT BEING OUT 
THERE AND KNOCKING IN BREAKS 
USED TO BEING OUT THERE 
IF HE WAS THREE TO ZERO IN FRONT YOU WOULD 
FANCY HIM POTTING THAT ONE 
CAN'T BEAT A LITTLE RUN OF THE BALL 
YOU SHOULD KNOW 
I USED TO BE SO 
UNLUCKY TERRY L. REMEMBER BUYING A 
SUIT AND BURNING THE JACKET L. WISH 
I HAD YOUR LUCK HAVE YOU NEVER HAD 
THE SAME THE LUCK OF THE WELSH 
HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD THE SAYING 
GOT ONE INTO THE CENTRE AND HE IS 
DOMINATING THIS MATCH 
THAT IS A HUGE GAP FIFTY THREE IS VERY LOW 
BUT OF COURSE THE BOY HASN'T POTTED 
A BALL IN THIS FRAME AND IN THE 
FIRST ONE A LOT OF BALLS WERE 
MISSED 
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE 
PREVIOUS FRAME HIS CUE BALL 
CONTROL HAS BEEN IMMACULATE IN THE 
LAST FEW FRAMES EVEN WHEN HE SLIPS 
SLIGHTLY OUT OF POSITION HE HAS 
PLAYED A GOOD SHOT LIKE HE DID 
THERE ON THAT RED 
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF NOISE FROM THE 
OTHER SIDE OF THE ARENA 
STILL VERY LITTLE DISTANCE BETWEEN 
THE WHITE'S AND THE OBJECT BALL 
BAK THE WHITE 
I DO NOT THINK OF THE SMASHING THE 
REDS OUT HE WILL PROBABLY NUDGE 
ONE OR TWO 
FORGOT ABOUT THE POT HOW OFF AND 
WE SEE THAT DASH MACRO OF DUNDEE 
SEE THAT 
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH HE HAS GOT AWAY 
WITH IT HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE THAT 
IT IS FORTY MINUTES SINCE STEPHEN LAST 
POTTED A RED 
I REMEMBER YOUR GOOD FRIEND DOUG 
MOUNTJOY DOING THAT AT THE U. K. 
CHAMPIONSHIP THE TIP FLOOR OFFICE 
CUE AND THEY COULD NOT FIND IT 
THE TIP CAME OFF HIS CUE 
IT IS ONE THING TO DO THAT NOW AND 
AGAIN BUT STEPHEN WERE SEEMS TO BE 
DOING IT QUITE OFTEN IN THESE 
CHAMPIONSHIPS BACKS STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE HE IS TRYING T. AND AMP G. HIMSELF 
UP BUT THERE ARE LIMITS THE 
REFEREE COULD WIN HIM WARNED HIM 
THIS SORT OF CONDUCT IS SPREADING 
A LOT OF PLAYERS SHAKING THE CUES 
IN THE AIR 
WATCH OUT EVERYBODY IN THE FRONT 
ROW AT THE CANNOT SEE THE BLACK 
AT LEAST HE HAS POTTED A RED THE 
FIRST ROVER FORTY MINUTES THE FIRST 
FOR OVER FORTY MINUTES THIS COULD BE 
AN AWKWARD FRAME 
YOU WOULDN'T FANCY GOING OUT TO ASK 
HIM FOR HIS AUTOGRAPH NOW 
I WAS 
OUT WITH CLIFF THORBURN THIS 
MORNING SOMEBODY CAME FROM BEHIND 
PUT A COLD BOTTLE THE BACK OF MY 
NECK 
HE IS A VERY NICE LAD GREAT SENSE 
OF HUMOUR GOOD COMPANY 
HE WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST PLAYER WE 
HAVE SEEN TURN INTO A LITTLE BIT OF 
AT LEAST WHEN HE PLAYS TURNS 
INTO BIT OF A BEAST 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE IS A BIT OF A BULLY 
WHEN HE IS OUT THERE AND I MEAN 
THAT IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN SAID OF STEPHEN 
HE CAN BULLY A LOT OF THE PLAYERS 
POORLY IN THE CONTEXT OF KNOCKING 
ALL THE BALLS IN POORLY WE DO 
NOT MEAN HE IS GOING TO HIT ANYBODY 
NOT YET ANYWAY HIT NO WE TRY TO PUT 
THIS RED IN OFF THE BLACK 
IF HE TAKES THAT RED ON THERE IS 
WHERE HE WOULD HAVE TO SEND IT TO 
HE HAD TO TO MANOEUVRE THE CUE 
BALL TO GET IN THEIR GAP WE SPOKE 
ABOUT TO GET THROUGH THE GAP WE 
SPOKE ABOUT IT IS MACKIE HAS 
ADDED DIFFICULTY TO MATCH UP 
JOE PERRY SURPRISED US ALL WHEN HE 
MISSED BLACK 
UP TO THAT STAGE HE HAD HARDLY 
MISSED ANYTHING HE SCORED OVER TWO HUNDRED 
POINTS AGAINST STEPHEN MAGUIRE'S ZERO 
JUST CONCENTRATING ON THE PINK FOR 
THE TIME BEING JOE IS COMING TO 
HAVE A LOOK AT THE BLACK HE COULD 
POT IT HE DOES NOT HAVE TO HE IS 
FORTY FIVE POINTS IN FRONT BUT THAT TELLS 
US THE BLACK DOES GO 
WHAT A START FOR A GENTLE MAN JOE 
GENTLEMAN JOE WE KNOW HE'S 
CAPABLE OF THIS A LITTLE BIT OF A 
SHOCK FOR STEPHEN MAGUIRE AND IS AN 
ARMY OF SUPPORTERS HIS ARMY OF 
SUPPORTERS HE HAS POTTED ONE BALL 
IN OVER FIFTY MINUTES STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
THE PRACTISE TABLE TERRY 
YES YOU WOULD THINK SO THESE LADS 
HAVE GOT LOT OF MATCH PLAY 
SNOOKER UNDER THEIR BELT THEY DID 
NOT PRACTISE A MUCH BUT I WOULD 
RECOMMEND IT 
I THINK YOU'LL JUST 
RELAX IN HIS DRESSING ROOM CUEING 
BEAUTIFULLY NO NEED TO GO I YOU'RE 
NEAR THE PRACTICE TABLE 
JOE PERRY IS DOING THE BULLYING 
AND IS FOR SURE 
THEY'RE PLAYING AT QUITE A QUICK 
TEMPO THIS SUITS JOE PERRY FASTER 
RHYTHM 
BUT THE AVERAGE SHOT TIME RHYTHM FOR JOE PERRY SIXTEEN SECONDS STEPHEN 
IS UP UP THIRTY EIGHT SECONDS BUT HE HAS HAD 
NOTHING TO GO AT STEPHEN IS A VERY 
QUICK PLAYER GILL DOES NOT WALK 
AROUND THE TABLE VERY FAST JOE 
PERRY DOES NOT WALK AROUND THE 
TABLE VERY FAST HE HAS HAD BREAKS 
OF SIXTY EIGHT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE HE HAS THIRTY SO FAR IN 
THIS FRAME ALREADY HE DOESN'T 
REALLY WANT AN INTERVAL 
NO RIGHT ENOUGH WE HAVE SEEN MANY 
TIMES HELEN INTERVAL CAN CHANGE THE 
PATTERN OF PLAY MAGUIRE WILL 
CERTAINLY BE GLAD OF THE BREAK HE 
MAY KNOCK FEW BALLS ABOUT ON THE PRACTICE TABLE EXCELLENT STUFF FROM JOE PERRY 
THAT IS A SUPERB POT FROM JOE PERRY 
PERFECT CUEING THE WAY REDS 
AND OPENED THERE AT LEAST FIVE 
EASY REDS AVAILABLE WHAT AN AIR A 
CHANCE 
HE HAS GOT A GOOD ANGLE HERE HE HAS JUST OVERDONE IT WAS 
HOPING TO TAKE THIS RED ON AND 
BRING THE BLACK INTO PLAY VERY 
GOOD POSITIONAL SHOT A GOOD 
RECOVERY WILLIE TREAD IS THAT 
THESE REDS WILLIE TRY TO SPLIT 
THESE REDS HE HIT THAT ABSOLUTELY 
PERFECTLY LOOK AT THE MAD OF TOP 
SPIN HE HAS TO GET ON THE CUE BALL 
TO MAKE THE SHOT 
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT THE ONLY 
DOWNSIDE IS A RED HAS BLOCKED THE 
PATH OF THE MIDDLE POCKET IF THE 
PINK DOES NOT GO HE WILL HAVE TO GO 
FREE YELLOW GREEN OR BROWN 
HE IS O. K. HE DOES LOOK VERY COMFORTABLE THIS THIS SCORELINE MAY COME AS QUITE A SHOCK 
TO SOME BUT JOE PERRY IS IN FRONT 
AND FULLY DESERVES TO BE HE HAS 
PLAYED EXCELLENTLY HERE 
IT EASY THE BLUE IN THE TOP POCKET 
OR SAFETY HE IS LOOKING AT THE 
PINK IN THE CENTRE L. WOULD MUCH 
PREFER THE OPEN POCKET BLUE DOWN 
THE CORNER I WOULD PREFER 
IT IS A TRICKY LITTLE ONE BUT IF 
IT WORKS MAYBE HE SHOULD HAVE 
LISTENED TO YOU TERRY HIS BEST IN 
THE WAY HE IS 
THE E. T. A. SPLIT SOME REDS IT WAS A 
POSITIVE SHOT HE COULD HAVE GONE 
ON TO WIN THE FRAME HE HAD TO 
SPLIT THE REDS SOME PLAYERS PREFER 
CUT TOO STRAIGHT SHOT THAT BLUE IN 
THE BOTTOM LOOK INVITING THERE WAS 
A RED ON STEPHEN MAGUIRE MUST HAVE 
BEEN SITTING THERE THINKING I AM 
NOT GOING TO GET ANOTHER SHOT HERE 
HE IS NOW BACK IN AMONGST THEM 
THAT IS THE FIRST TRICKY LITTLE 
PROBLEM AND THE WAY OUT OF THE 
WAY IT DOES NOT LOOK THAT GREAT 
FORD THAT'S GREAT FORWARD WELL PLAYED 
HE IS SEVENTEEN POINTS BEHIND BUT IS 
FAVOURITE TO WIN THIS FRAME FROM 
HERE 
ONCE AGAIN IT IS AMAZING HOW THE 
INTERVAL DOES CHANGE HELL MATCH IS 
GOING BEFORE THE INTERVAL STEPHEN 
WILL WERE COULD NOT GET TO THE 
TABLE 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE HE DOES LIKE 
THEM AND THE POCKET STEPHEN HE 
DOES LIKE TO PUNCH THEM 
HE IS THE 
TYPE OF PLAYER WHO CAN GO ON A RON 
AND NOT MISS ANYTHING FOR LONG 
SPELLS BIG BREAKS ALL THE TIME A 
VERY STRONG PLAYER STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
WE HAVE NOT SEEN LOT OF IT SO FAR 
IN THIS MATCH HE IS JOINT 
FAVOURITE WITH RONNIE O'SULLIVAN TO 
WIN HE DISREGARD OF THAT HE SAID 
THERE A LOT OF GOOD PLAYERS LEFT 
INTERESTING THAT YOU SHOULD MENTION 
RONNIE US OVER AND STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
HAS BEEN FAVOURITES THEY'RE BOTH 
AT NINE CENTURIES IN THIS YEAR'S 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS THEY HAVE 
BOTH HAD NINE CENTURIES 
RONNIE IS 
ON TOP OF THE HIGH BREAKS WITH A 
ONE FOR SEVEN AND SECOND WHIP ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
HE IS ALREADY ON ONE AND AND FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND 
FOR THE ONE FOR SALE AND WOULD BE 
ONE OF AND FORTY SEVEN ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND 
THE CANNON HE PLAYED FOR WENT WRONG 
THERE 
YOU WOULD EXPECT HIM TO CLEAR FROM 
HERE HE IS STILL UNDER A LITTLE 
BIT OF PRESSURE 
JUST THIS RED AND HE HAS GOT HIS 
SECOND REIGN TWO MORE TO BE PLAYED 
IN THIS SESSION 
HIS BEST BREAKS SO FAR AND THE 
MATCH HE HAD A FIFTY FOUR IN THE PREVIOUS 
FRAME 
VERY QUICK IMPROVEMENT COMING HERE 
HE NEEDED IT BADLY 
A LITTLE BIT OF ENCOURAGEMENT FOR 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE FANS THE BLACK 
GOES IN HIS HIGHEST BREAK SO FAR 
IN THIS MATCH HE TRAILS JOE PERRY 
BY FOUR TO TWO 
JOE PERRY BREAKS UP HE REALLY 
WANTS ONE OF THESE REMAIN IN TWO RE 
IN MS. GIBBONS WILL AN OVERNIGHT 
LEAD ONE OF THESE TWO REMAINING 
FRAMES HE WOULD SETTLE FOR A FIVE TO THREE 
ONE OF THE PET HATE OF US THAT 
THERE IS CATCHING WORD MAC COLOUR CATCHICK CATCHING A BAULK 
YOU SAY ABOUT THE BAULK CHORUS OF 
MACRO COORS 
HAVE YOU WERE TOLD ME WENT TO WATCH 
JOHN BOORMAN AND THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS HE SAID HE DID NOT 
HIT THE BAULK COLOURS ONCE WITH HIS 
SAFETY GREAT STORY TELLER 
YOU HAVE GOT TO KEEP THESE YOUNG 
MAN UP THE TABLE WHEN T. GET GOING 
HE IS ONCE HE GETS GOING 
IF YOU CAN KEEP HIM IN THE CHAIR 
HIS COMPONENTS LEVEL DROPS DOWN A 
LITTLE AT THE MOMENT JOE PERRY IS 
NOT MANAGING THAT 
HE PLAYED TO SPLIT THOSE REDS AND 
LEAVE HIMSELF ON THE BOTTOM RED 
TOUCHING BALL DECLARED THEN ALLOWED 
HIM TO PLAY AWAY HE WILL BE 
ABSOLUTELY BOILING MAGUIRE HE WAS 
IN THEN AND THAT IS VERY MUCH HIS 
STRONG SUIT IN HIS GAME AMONGST 
THE BALLS ON THE BLACK HE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN FANCIED TO WIN THE FRAME 
FROM THERE NOW HE HAS TO GO AND 
SIT DOWN IT IS VERY TESTING 
A BONUS FOR STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
HE IS BACK IN AGAIN AFTER LOSING 
POSITION THE PREVIOUS TIME IT HAS GONE WRONG AGAIN 
THAT IS TWO CHANCES HE HAS PAID FOURTEEN 
AND SIXTEEN NOT GOOD TIMES FOR STEVE 
MAGUIRE 
HE NEEDED TO AVOID THE YELLOW HE 
HAD SHAVED IT IS THAT ENOUGH TO 
LEAVE THE RED ON L. THINK IT IS 
JOE PERRY IS LINING THE TUB 
MINUTE UP HE IS LINING IT UP 
THAT WAS A HORRIBLE KICK AND LOOK 
WHERE THE WHITE HAS FINISHED THERE 
IS NO WAY IN THE WORLD HE WOULD 
HAVE CANNONED THE PINK HE WOULD 
HAVE SLIPPED PAST THE PINK AND 
FINISHED PERFECTLY ON THE BLACK 
THE WHITE STRAIGHTENS UP HERE THAT 
WOULD HAVE PASSED THE PINK AND HE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN IN PERFECT POSITION 
THAT WAS JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE 
HEAVY CONTACT NORMALLY IF HE HAD 
JUST BEEN POTTING THE BLUE AND 
PLAYING POSITION FOR IT HE WOULD 
HAVE POTTED IT BUT THE FACT THAT 
HE GOT HEAVY CONTACT WAS JUST 
AFFECTING HIM THERE 
YES HE KNEW 
THEN IF 
HE MISSED THE BLUE 
GOING TO LEAVE A RED ON THIS IS 
HIS THIRD CHANCE AMONG THE BALLS 
WITH THE BLACK ON ITS SPOT 
IS HE GOING TO PLAY FOR THE LOOSE 
RED OR IS HE GOING TO TRY AND 
SPREAD A FEW OUT HE'S HAVING IN 
LOOK AT THE REDS THERE IS ONE AT 
THE TOP NEAR THE PINK SPOT WHICH 
MAY GO IN THE RIGHT CORNER 
OH WELL WELL THIS WILL BE THE 
THIRD TIME HE HAS BEEN IN THERE AND 
FINISHED MORE LESS TOUCHING A RED 
IF NOT TOUCHING IT DENNIS A A LITTLE SMILE AS HE WALKS ROUND THE 
TABLE AMAZING HOW THE WHITE STUCK 
ON THE REDS SOMETIMES HE GETS 
ANNOYED BUT HE JUST SHOWS YOU 
THERE WITH THE LITTLE SMILE TO THE 
CROWD THERE THAT HE KNOWS THAT THE 
FRAME IS NOW GOING TO BE A BIT 
COMPLICATED BECAUSE OF THAT RED 
OVER THE MIDDLE 
AT LEAST THE RED WILL NOT CUT IN I 
THINK JOE WILL MAYBE TRY TO PLAY 
THE RED THAT IS OVER THE POCKET IF 
IT HITS THE ANGLE OF THE POCKET IT 
SHOULD COME BACK THIS WAY OR AT 
LEAST SAY THIS SIDE OF THE BLUE 
SPOT STAY THIS SIDE OF THE BLUE 
SPOT 
VERY DIFFICULT DURING OUT OF THAT 
CORNER POCKET FOR JOE CUEING OUT 
OF THAT CORNER POCKET 
HE MAY NEED SOME ASSISTANCE FROM 
THE EXTENSIONS BUT HE IS ON THE 
BLUE 
NOT SO EASY THESE TYPE OF SHOTS 
WHEN THE OBJECT BALL IS CLOSE TO 
THE POCKET THINK HE IS O. K. 
HE IS NOT TOO HE DIDN'T WANT TO COME TO SHORT 
BECAUSE THERE WAS A RED AT THE BACK 
OF THE PACK AVAILABLE AND ONE IN 
THE CENTRE 
I DON'T KNOW IF THE RED 
IS GOING TO COME INTO PLAY ON THE 
SIDE CUSHION HE NORMALLY WOULD 
ROLL IT IN BUT HE COULD STUN IT AND AVOID 
THE CANNON 
ON TO 
THAT 
BUT HE 
HAS GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT HE 
DOESN'T CANNON THAT RED 
AND DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE BEEN 
TRYING TO CANNON THE RED OUT THERE 
TERRY 
HE MAY HAVE MISJUDGED THE TERRY ANGLE OFF THE RED I DON'T KNOW 
BUT I AGREE WITH YOU ALTHOUGH HE 
WAS THIRTY EIGHT POINTS BEHIND I MEAN THAT 
RED WASN'T IN A BAD POSITION FOR A 
RIGHT HANDER 
ALL VERY TRYING FOR THE TWO LADS 
OUT THERE 
I KNOW HE WAS GOING TO 
NEED THAT RED EVENTUALLY BUT 
SOMETIMES YOU ARE BETTER AT GETTING 
RIGHT BACK INTO THE FRAME BEFORE 
YOU LOOK TO MOVE ON 
FRED DAVIS OF 
COURSE USED TO SAY NEVER PLAY TO 
CANNON A RED OUT OF A RED OFF A 
RED 
NOT A 
BAD PHILOSOPHY NOT RED BAD PLAYER EITHER FRED DAVIS 
STILL PLAYING AT THE CRUCIBLE 
WASN'T HE WE CAN ALL REMEMBER THAT 
SONG WHEN I'M SIXTY FOUR THIRTY YEARS AGO 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT TERRY SEMI SEMI FINALIST THAT YEAR WHAT AN 
ACHIEVEMENT THAT WAS PROBABLY THE 
BEST SAFETY PLAYER I HAVE EVER SEEN 
MEANWHILE STEVE MAGUIRE HAS JUST 
PULLED OUT A FANTASTIC LONG RED 
THERE 
WELL LITTLE REACTION THERE FROM 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE BECAUSE HE KNEW 
THAT THAT WAS GOING TO GIVE HIM THE 
FRAME BUT IT IS QUITE UNUSUAL TO 
DO THAT AT THIS STAGE IN A FRAME 
BUT IT WAS TOUGH POT AND HE 
PLAYED IT PERFECTLY HE HAD TO PLAY 
IT WITH PACE HE IS REALLY FIRED UP 
IS STEPHEN YOU CAN'T BLAME HIM FOR 
THAT IT IS THE QUARTER FINAL OF 
THE EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT C. O. M. WORLD SNOOKER 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
HE HAD TO FORCE IT IN AND THAT'S 
WHAT IT MEANS TO HIM HE REALLY IS 
FIRED UP 
DO YOU THINK HE IS TRYING TO WIN 
THIS YEAR'S CHAMPIONSHIP 
OH HE IS 
A TRIER THAT'S FOR SURE BUT THAT 
WAS A BIG SHOT THAT BLACK STUCK ON 
THE REPLAY IT WAS NOT THE SHOT I 
ORIGINALLY THOUGHT IF HE HAD 
MISSED IT THAT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE 
LEFT JOE PERRY IN 
HE TRIED TO FORCE THE CUE BALL IN 
OFF TWO CUSHIONS WITH A LOT OF TOP 
AND LEFT HAND SIDE TO POSSIBLY RUN 
THROUGH FOR THE BOTTOM OF THOSE 
THREE REDS MORE IMPORTANTLY 
THOUGH HE HAS GOT THE GREEN IN SO SO BORING SNOOKERS STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
HAS WON HIS THIRD FRAME IN A ROW 
BARRING SNOOKERS AND HE IS JUST 
ONE BEHIND NOW 
JOE JUST SAID TO STEPHEN IS IT O. K. 
IF I CAN SEE IT STEPHEN KIND THE 
ACCEPT SO THE INTERVAL HAS CHANGED 
THINGS RIGHT AROUND STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE HAS WON ALL THREE FRAMES 
AND HE IS JUST ONE BEHIND AT FOUR THREE 
HE GOT IN BETWEEN THE YELLOW AND 
BROWN THERE THAT'S AN EXCELLENT 
SHOT HE WAS TAKING A SLIGHT RISK 
BUT HE COULDN'T SEE ANY BETTER 
PROPOSITION THE SAFETY SIDE OF 
THAT SHOT NOW THEN JOE PERRY HAS 
GOT TO BE CAREFUL NOW HE WOULDN'T 
WANT TO GO DOWN TO THE BAULK AREA 
WITH THAT RED JUST ABOVE THE GREEN 
THERE IS A BIT OF WORK TO BE DONE 
HERE STEPHEN MAGUIRE THIRTY NINE POINTS IN 
FRONT JOE PERRY HASN'T POTTED A 
BALL FOR COMING UP TO TWENTY THREE MINUTES 
AND STEPHEN MAGUIRE HASN'T POTTED 
ONE FOR COMING UP TO TEN MINUTES 
WHO IS POTTING THE BALLS OUT THERE 
THEN TERRY 
MUST BE OUR FRIEND JAN 
VERHAAS 
A CLEVER SHOT PUTTING THAT RED 
TIGHT ON THE CUSHION PROTECTING 
HIS LEAD 
THEY'RE TESTING EACH OTHER SAFETY 
GAME AT THEIR EACH OTHER'S SAFETY 
GAME AND BOTH OF THEM DOING QUITE 
WELL FOR THE MOMENT L. L. THINK THE 
RED INTO THE LEFT CENTRE MIGHT BE 
AVAILABLE THERE IS ONE PAST THE 
YELLOW INTO THE RIGHT CENTRE BUT 
WITH THE BLUE AND PINK TIDE UP 
THERE NO POINT IN GOING FOR THAT 
I THINK HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH IT 
SOMEWHAT NO EASY POT BLUE AND 
PINK ARE AWKWARD IF HE TRIES TO 
TAKE THE ONE UP INTO THE LEFT 
CORNER BROWN IS ON THE BOTTOM 
CUSHION BLACK IS ON THE BACK 
CUSHION A FEW MORE REDS A BIT 
AWKWARD OTHER THAN THAT 
EVERYTHING ELSE IS OUT IN THE OPEN 
HOW THIN WAS THAT HE ALMOST OVER 
CUT IT HE CUT IT SO THIN IT 
LOOKED AT ONE STAGE AS IF IT WASN'T 
GOING TO REACH THE POCKET 
DAIRY DIFFICULT THE WAY THE BALLS 
ARE PLACED THE BLACK IS TIED ON 
THIS CUSHION VERY DIFFICULT 
TIGHT ON THIS CUSHION DO WELL TO 
GET TEN HERE 
HE WON'T GET IT NOW HE WAS PLAYING BELIEVE IT OR NOT 
TO GET ON THE TWO REDS NEAR THE 
PINK SPOT SO HE HAD NO TO HE HAD 
NO INTENTION OF CANNONING INTO THE 
BLUE AND PINK THERE 
WELL HE PUT THE CUE BALL THERE HE 
HAS GOT TO PLAY THE SHOT I AM 
AFRAID HE IS GIVING THIS A FAIR 
AMOUNT OF TIME 
HE COULD GLANCE OFF 
THE RED AND JUST LEAVE THE WHITE 
DOWN ON THE CUSHION THERE THE 
BROWN WOULD BLOCK THE PATH OF THAT 
RED 
HE HAS PLAYED IT WELL HE WAS LEFT 
HALF A CHANCE IN THE CENTRE AGAIN 
A VERY THIN CUT HE COULD HAVE JUST 
ROLLED ON TO THAT RED AND KEPT IT 
SAFE SEEMED BIT COMPLICATED TO 
ME SOMETIMES WHEN THE BALLS ARE 
PLACED AWKWARDLY YOU CAN PLAY YOUR 
HAND AND GOOD POSSIBILITIES AND IN THE INDICATED BIT MIXED UP 
IT IS A SNOWDROP BLACK INTO THE 
RIGHT CORNER THAT MAY GET HIM ON 
TO THOSE TWO REDS A BIT ALL OR 
NOTHING THAT ONE 
IT IS A 
POSSIBILITY THOUGH 
I THINK HE'S PLAYING IT A LITTLE 
CONSERVATIVELY HE IS JUST TRYING 
TO GET THE SEVEN POINTS THERE WAS 
A SHOT ON THAT HE COULD HAVE LEFT 
THE WHITE HE COULD HAVE PUT THE 
WHITE THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE REDS 
THERE BUT THEN IF THE BACK DIDN'T 
GOING HE WOULD LOSE THE FRAME 
IF THE BLACK DIDN'T GO IN 
YOU SAW HIS CUE COME UP IN THE AIR 
HE KNEW AS SOON AS HE HIT THAT CUE 
BALL HE WASN'T GOING TO MAKE THE 
CONTACT THAT HE WAS HOPING FOR ON 
THE RED 
THAT COULD HAVE TURNED OUT 
WORSE HE MAY FINDINGS OF TIGHT 
BEHIND THE YELLOW THOUGH IF 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE HAS GOT THE RIGHT 
ANGLE ON THE SHOT 
HE HAD A KICK BUT HE HAS PUT 
ANOTHER RED ON THE SIDE CUSHION IF 
HE DIDN'T HAVE THE KICK I THINK 
THAT CUE BALL WOULD BE TOUCHING NOW 
BEHIND THE YELLOW STILL THIRTY EIGHT POINTS 
IN FRONT STEPHEN MAGUIRE BUT THE 
BLACK IS BACK OFF THE CUSHION NOW 
ONLY THE BROWN IS ANYWHERE NEAR THE 
CUSHION 
EARLIER ON IT WAS STEPHEN MAGUIRE 
SHOWING HIS FRUSTRATION OUT THERE 
AND NOW IT IS JOE PERRY 
HE REALLY HAS BATTLED HERE IN THIS 
FINAL FRAME OF THIS SESSION HE HAS 
PLAYED VERY TIGHT TOUGH SNOOKER 
LOOK AT THOSE EYES ISN'T HE 
DETERMINED AND IT HAS TO BE SAID 
A TERRIFIC PERFORMANCE TO COME BACK 
AFTER THE MID SESSION INTERVAL AND 
TAKE ALL FOUR FRAMES TO DRAW LEVEL 
JOE PERRY WOULD HAVE BEEN THINKING 
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE JUST GIVE 
ME ONE FRAME TO HAVE AN OVERNIGHT 
LEAD 
YES BUT STEPHEN MAGUIRE HAS BEEN 
PUT TO THE TEST HERE IN THE 
PREVIOUS ROUND HE LED NINE TO ZERO AGAINST 
NEIL ROBERTSON AND WAS TESTED WHEN 
HE CAME BACK BUT THIS TIME HE WAS 
BEHIND ALL THESE THINGS WOULD HELP 
TO STRENGTHEN YOU UP IN THIS 
CHAMPIONSHIP YOU HAVE TO GO 
THROUGH ALL THESE THINGS AND IF YOU 
COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE YOU ARE O. K. 
A REALLY SPIRITED FIGHTBACK FROM 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE WHO HAS NOT LOOKED 
IN ANY TROUBLE SO FAR APART FROM IN 
THAT SESSION IT IS LEVEL TERMS 
GOING INTO THE SECOND SESSION THIS 
AFTERNOON WE WILL BE ON AIR FROM 
TWO P. M. HERE ON B. B. C. TWO COVERAGE OF 
THE QUARTER FINALS CONTINUES ON 
INTERACTIVE FROM TEN A M. UNTIL THEN 
GOOD NIGHT
