CRUCIAL WHOLE CITY THE LIGHT WENT OUT 
POST ALALERT A REVIEW SAYS 
PITCHING THE ROYAL MAIL AGAINST THE 
COMPETITION HASN'T BENEFITED 
CONSUMERS MORE CAMERAS MONITOR OUR 
STREETS THAN ANY WHERE ELSE IN 
EUROPE BUT A SENIOR POLICEMAN 
SAYING THEY ARE NOT STOPPING CRIME 
AND HEAD TO HEAD YET AGAIN BUT 
CAN HILLARY CLINTON DO ENOUGH IN 
TODAY'S PRIMARY ELECTIONS TO STAY 
IN THE DEMOCRAT RACE LATER ON B. B. C. 
LONDON THE NEW MAYOR GETS DOWN TO 
BUSINESS TACKLING YOUTH CRIME AND 
SIGNALLY PROBLEMS LEAVES HUNDREDS 
STUCK ON TRAINS IN AND OUT OF 
EUSTON 
GOOD AFTERNOON THE AUTHORITYS IN 
BURMA SAY AT LEAST FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE 
WERE KILLED BY THE POWERFUL CYCLONE 
THAT HIT THE COUNTRY ON SATURDAY 
ALTHOUGH LATEST REPORTS SUGGEST THE 
DEATH TOLL COULD BE OVER TWENTY THOUSAND 
THE NORMALLY SECRETIVE STATE SAYS 
IT WILL ACCEPT INTERNATIONAL AID 
ALTHOUGH IT IS UNCLEAR WHEN THE 
AGENCIES WILL BE ALLOWED INTO THE 
COUNTRY CYCLONE NARGIS STRUCK 
BURMA ON SATURDAY TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE 
WERE KILLED IN THE TOWN OF BOGALAY 
ALONE IT IS ESTIMATED UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND 
PEOPLE ARE STILL MISSING NEW NOT 
TADGE OF THE SIGH LOAN AS IT TORE 
THROUGH BURMA IN AL HOWL OF TRUCKION 
SATURDAY'S STORM FLATTENED TOWNS 
AND VILLAGES UP TO ONE MILLION 
PEOPLE ARE NOW HOMELESS IN RANGOON 
A CITY HIT HARD FUEL AND WATER 
SUPPLIES ARE DANGEROUSLY LOW 
ELECTRICITY AS WELL AS WATER SUPPLY 
CUT OFF 
OUTSIDE THE CITY THE 
PICTURE IS FAR GRIMMER MANY 
SURVIVORS ARE SPENDING THEIR FOURTH 
DAY IN THE OPEN THESE PEOPLE 
DRYING OUT THEIR POSSESSION ON A 
RAILWAY TRACK THE STORM SMASHED 
BRIDGES AND WRECKED INFRASTRUCTURE 
EVEN NOW SOME OF THE HARDEST HIT 
AREAS ARE STILL CUT OFF THE VAST 
FLOOD PLAINS OF THE IRRAWADDY DELTA 
ARE HIDING THE WORST OF THIS 
DISASTER 
THE LOGISTIC INVOLVES ARE DISASTER MIND BOGGLING THERE WILL BE A NEED 
FOR SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TRUNG 
TRUCKS AND BOATS AND IT APPEARS 
THAT MANY OF THE BOETS WE WILL NEED 
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED WE ARE LOOKING 
AT THE SCALE OF THE TSUNAMI HERE 
BURMA'S MILITARY GOVERNMENT HAS 
BEEN FORCED TO ASK THE OUTSIDE 
WORLD FOR HELP SOMETHING IT DIDN'T 
DO AFTER THE ASIAN TSUNAMI THE 
SCALE OF THIS DISASTER HAS CLEARLY 
JOLTED A RECLUSIVE REGIME THERE THERE HAS BEEN AN OPENNESS WE HAVEN'T 
EXPERIENCED BEFORE EVEN AFTER THE 
TSUNAMI IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHEN THE 
GOVERNMENT DIDN'T WANT TO RECEIVE 
INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE THIS TIME 
THEY ARE BEING VERY OPEN ABOUT IT 
THEY ARE DISCUSSING IT AND THERE 
IS A WILLINGNESS THERE TO RECEIVE 
WHICH MUST INDICATE HOW MUCH PEOPLE 
ARE SUFG ON THE GROUND 
SUFFERING 
ALREADY BURMA'S NEIGHBOURS ARE 
RACING TO SEND IN SUPPLIES FROM 
THAILAND SINGAPORE AND INDIA BUT 
IT WILL TAKE A MUCH BIGGER AID 
OPERATION TO MEET THE NEEDS OF 
THIS ISOLATED AND DEVASTATED 
COUNTRY LET US SPEAK TO OUR ASIA 
CORRESPONDENT IN BANGKOK AND AS 
YOU SUGGESTED THERE THE PRACTICAL 
PROBLEMS IMMENSE WE ARE ONLY 
BEGINNING TO SEE THE REAL PROBLEMS 
NOW YOU HAVE SPOKE ON THE THE AID 
AGENCY WHAT ARE THEY ABLE TO DO AT 
THE MOMENT 
WELL THEIR PROBLEMS AT 
THIS STAGE RANGE FROM SIMPLY 
GETTING VIE VISAS AND PERMITS TO GO 
INTO BURMA THIS IS NOT A COUNTRY 
THAT OPENS ITS DOORS WIDE EVEN IN A 
DISASTER LIKE THIS TO THE PROBLEM 
OF WHAT HAPPENS ONCE THE AID 
ARRIVES AT THE AIRPORT IN RANGOON 
AFTER THAT IT STILL HAS TO GET OUT 
TO THE FLOOD PLAIN THEY NEED BOATS 
HELP COLL TERS PLANE TO GET TO 
THESE REMOTE AREAS AND WITHIN THE 
LAST FEW MINUTES WE HAVE HEARD THAT 
THE DEATH TOLL HAS RISEN TO MORE 
THAN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND SO CLEARLY A HUGE 
OPERATION IS NEEDED AND IT IS GOING 
TO TAKE SOME DAYS BEFORE IT IS 
REALLY UP AND RUNNING THE PRIME 
REALLY UP AND RUNNING THE PRIME MINISTER HAS PLEDGED AID TO BURMA 
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN CALLS BY SOME 
CAMPAIGNERS FOR GOVERNMENTS TO DO 
MORE TO PRESSURE THE AUTHORITIES TO 
ALLOW AID AGENCIES BETTER ACCESS 
LET US SPEAK TO THE INTERNATIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT SECRETARY WHAT IS THE 
GOVERNMENT DOING TO ENSURE AID 
AGENCIES GET BETTER ACCESS YOU 
KNOW AS WELL AS ANYONE THE FIRST 
FEW DAYS HERE ARE CRUCIAL TO SAVE 
LIVES 
YES IT IS AN EXTREMELY LIVES SERIOUS SITUATION THAT IS WHY I 
HAVE SPOKE ON THE THE PRIME 
MINISTER THIS MORNING WE ARE 
COMMITTING TODAY UP TO FIVE MILLION 
OF IMMEDIATE RELIEF EFFORT TO GO 
THROUGH THE MUN OH UNITED NATIONS 
BUT WE ARE STRONGLY URGING TO 
GOVERNMENT OF BURMA TO ALLOW THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO 
UNDERTAKE THIS WORK WE WILL OF 
COURSE BE CONTACTING THEMSELVES 
DIRECTLY WE WILL BE WORKING WITH 
THE UN WE HAVE AN ASSESSMENT TEAM 
HERE IN THE U. K. READY TO FLY TO 
BURMA WE WILL BE MAKING SURE IN 
THE HOURS TO COME WE ARE DOING 
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THE INTERNATIONAL RELIEF 
EFFORT REACHES THE PEOPLE WHO NEED 
IT THE MONEY WILL BE WELCOME BUT 
NOT REALLY IF IT DOESN'T GET 
THROUGH THE AGENCIES SAY WHAT IS 
NEEDED IS A HELICOPTER PLANE LOADS 
OF SUPPLY TEAM TONS GROUND THAT 
IS NOT HAPPENING SO WHAT KIND OF 
COMMUNICATION HAVE YOU HAD WITH THE 
AUTHORITIES IF ANYTHING WELL THE 
UNITED NATIONS ARE PUTTING THEIR 
ASSESSMENT TEAMS IN ADDS AT THE 
MOMENT WE ARE WATCHING TO MATCH 
THAT IN TERMS OF PUTTING IN OUR OWN 
ASSESS M. OF WHAT IS NEEDED IN 
PREVIOUS NATURAL DISASTERS WE HAVE 
BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL 
SUPPORT BEYOND FINANCAL AID BUT WE 
NEED TO GET PROPER ACCESS TO WE THE 
CAN MAKE THE ACCESSMENT WE ARE 
SPEAKING TO THE UN WHO HAVE 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE BURMESE 
GOVERNMENT AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
PRESS THEM TO ALLOW THE WHOLE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO RESPOND 
IN THE MANNER PEOPLE WOULD WISH 
THANK YOU NOW AN INDEPENDENT 
REVIEW OF THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS 
FOUND THAT OPENING UP THE BUSINESS 
TO COMPETITION HAS HAD NO 
SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS FOR HOUSE 
HOLES AND SMALL BUSINESSES INSTEAD 
IT SAYS THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS 
UNTENABLE IT IS TWO JIERNS OTHER 
OPERATORS WERE ALLOWED TO COMPETE 
WITH THE ROYAL MAIL SO WHAT HASN'T 
WORKED IT IS AN INDEPENDENT REPORT 
COMMISSIONED BY MINISTERS AND IT 
SAYS OPENING UP THE MAIL MARKET 
HASN'T SOLVED POSTAL PROBLEMS IT 
SAYS FOR BULK MAIL COMPETITION HAS 
BEEN EXPANDING RAPIDLY BUT THAT 
HASN'T HAPPENED FOR OTHER USERS IT 
ARGUES THERE HAVE BEEN NO 
SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS FOR SMALLER 
BUSINESSES AND DOMESTIC CONSUMERS 
AND STAMP PRICES HAVE GONE UP FROM 
THIRTY PENCE FOR FIRST CLASS IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
TO THIRTY SIX PENCE NOW AND SECOND CLASS 
WHICH WAS TWENTY ONE PENCE THREE YEARS AGO 
IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN THE REPORT CONCLUDES 
THAT THE STATUS QUO IS NOT TENABLE 
ONE CONSUMER GROUP AGREES WITH THAT 
AND SAYS CUSTOMERS DESERVE BETTER 
ROYAL MAIL NEEDS TO UP ITS GAME IN 
TERMS OF DELIVERY OF PARCELS SO 
THEY CAN BE DELIVERED WHEN PEOPLE 
ARE THERE TO RECEIVE THEM THERE IS 
A RANGE OF OPPORTUNITIES BUT ONE 
WAY OR ANOTHER THE SITUATION WILL 
HAVE TO CHANGE 
THE REPORT NOTES 
THAT THE MOVE TO A SINGLE DAILY 
MAIL COLLECT SHIION AND LATER 
DELIVERLYRY TIMES LOOKS LIKE A 
REDUCTION IN SERVICE EVEN THOUGH 
ROYAL MAIL IS HITTING QUALITY 
TARGETS WE HAVE BEEN ASKING POST 
USERS IN BIRMINGHAM HOW THEY FEEL 
ABOUT THE SERVICE 
WE DON'T GET THE 
SUNDAY COLLECTIONS NOW WE DON'T 
GET TWO DELIVERYS IN A DAY MY MAIL 
IS VERY LATE 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT A 
CHOICE LIKE YOU STUCK WITH ONE OR 
NOTHING AREN'T YOU REALLY YOU KNOW 
WHAT DO YOU DO L. DON'T THINK 
NOTHING YOU CAN DO 
YOU DON'T GET 
VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY IF THEY CAN 
RAISE THE MONEY WHEN EVER THEY WANT 
YOU DO HAVE A SAY IN IT BECAUSE WE 
NEED THE SERVICE 
THE REPORT SAYS 
THE ROYAL MAIL STILL HAS FINANCIAL 
HEADACHES AND THERE IS A THREAT TO 
ITS ABILITY TO PROVIDE A UNIVERSAL 
SERVICE THOSE ARE THE POSTAL 
PROBLEM THE REVIEW TEAM WILL TRY 
NOW TO COME UP WITH IDEAS FOR 
ACTION IN ITS NEXT REPORT THE IND 
THE INDEPENDENT POLICE COMPLAINTS 
COMMISSION HAS UP HELD FOUR 
ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT MADE 
AGAINST THE FORMER CHIEF CONSTABLE 
OF DYFED POWYS POLICE TERRY GRANGE 
THE ALLEGATION INCLUDE MAKES FALSE 
EXPENSE CLAIMS MISUSING THE POLICE 
COMPUTER SYSTEM AND FAILING TO 
ATTEND MEETING A SEARCH IS UNDER 
WAY FOR A DANGEROUS PAEDOPHILE 
WANTS FOR ABUSING CHILDREN IN SOUTH 
EAST ASIA INTERPOL ARE APPEALING 
TO THE PUBLIC TO IDENTIFY HIM IN 
ONLY THE SECOND MASS PUBLIC APPEAL 
OF THIS KIND LABOUR M. P.'S AND 
MINISTERS HAVE RETURNED TO 
WESTMINSTER AFTER A LONG WEEKEND 
DURING WHICH THEY HAD PLENTY OF 
TIME TO CONSIDER THE FALL OUT FROM 
THE ELECTION LOSSES AS THE 
GOVERNMENT FOCUSES ON TURNING 
OPINION ROUND THE CONSERVATIVES 
HAVE ANOTHER GOAL IN THEIR SIGHTS 
A BY ELECTION IN TWO WEEKS TYPE 
IS THIS THE START OF THE FIGHT 
BACK 
FOR GORDON BROWN IT WAS BACK BUSINESS AT USUAL EVEN THOUGH 
QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS FUTURE AND THAT 
OF HIS PARTY ARE ECHOING ABOUT 
WESTMINSTER AT A CONFERENCE ON 
HELPING THE DEVELOPING WORLD HE WAS 
IN HIS ELM GLOBAL POVERTY IS AN 
ISSUE CLOSE TO HIS HEART BUT AFTER 
LABOUR'S DRUBBING IN THE POLLS M. P.'S 
WANT TO KNOW HOW HE WILL DEAL WITH 
PROBLEMS CLOSER TO HOME GORDON 
BROWN MAY HAVE HAD A TORRID FEW 
DAYS BUT THERE IS NO SIGN OF THE 
PRESSURE LETTING UP THERE IS A 
THREATENED REVOLT OVER HIS PLANS TO 
DETAIN TERROR SUSPECTS FOR UP TO FORTY TWO 
DAYS AND CONTINUING UNREST OVER HIS 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN PENCE TAX BAND 
AN ISSUE THE TORIES SAY THEY WILL 
EXPLOIT TO THE FULL IN THE BY 
ELECTION IN CREWE IN TWO WEEKS TIME 
OUR MESSAGE WILL FOCUS ON THE TEN 
PENCE TAX RATE AND HOW GORDON BROWN 
IS HURING THE PEOPLE WITH TAX 
INCREASES AT THE MOMENT THEIR COST 
OF LIVING IS GOING UP 
THE CHIEF 
LABOUR REBEL ON TEN PENCE FEARS IT 
WILL DOMINATE CREWE 
THE FIRST 
THING THE PRIME MINISTER NEEDS TO 
DO IS TO SAY IN PUBLIC WHAT HE SAID 
IN PRIVATE AND WHAT I KNOW HE IS 
COMMITTED TO SH AND THAT IS WE WILL 
FIND AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE TO 
COMPENSATE THEM FOR THE LOSS OF THE 
TEN PENCE THAT WE WILL USE ANY 
METHOD OF GETTING MONEY TO THEM 
HUMILITY AS BEEN THE KEY TONE FOR 
MINISTERS SINCE THEIR DISASTROUS 
SHOWING LA LAST WEEK THEY ACCUSE 
NONG THEY NEED TO WIN KEY SECTION 
OF VOTERS BACK 
THAT WIDE 
COALITION OF HARD WORKING PEOPLE 
NEEDS TO SEE A BIT MORE CLARITY 
FROM US ABOUT THE THINGS WE THINK 
ARE IMPORTANT AND THEY JUST YOU 
KNOW THEY TAKE THE CHANCE OF 
ELECTIONS TO REMIND US OF WHO IS 
THE BOSS 
AT CABINET TODAY THEY 
WILL NO DOUBT HAVE BEEN MINDFUL OF 
THE THAT MESSAGE EXPECT A RAFT OF 
ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE COMING WEEKS 
AIMED AT WOOING PUBLIC OPINION THE 
ARMED FORCES REHABILITATION CENTRE 
HEADLEY COURT IN SURREY IS TO GET 
TWENTY FOUR MILLION FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO 
UPGRADE ITS FACILITIES FOR WOUNDED 
SERVICE ENAND WOMEN THE DEFENCE 
SECRETARY CONFIRMED THE INVESTMENT 
WHEN HE VISITED THE UNIT TODAY BUT 
QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED AS TO 
WHETHER IT IS GOING TO BE ENOUGH 
OUR DEFENCE CORRESPONDENT REPORTS 
NO ORDINARY GYM NO ORDINARY WORK 
OUT THE MORNING SESSION AT HEADLEY 
COURT IS VITAL FOR THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY PATIENTS 
BEING TREATED HERE THE DEFENCE 
SECRETARY CAME TO MEET SOME OF THE 
SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN TRYING TO 
RECO FROM THEIR INJURY HE INSISTED 
THE NEW GOVERNMENT MONEY WAS NOT A 
U. TURN BUT THE RESULT OF A LONG 
TERM REVIEW OF CARE 
TO UPGRADE 
IMPROVE AND EXTEND ACCOMMODATION 
TO BUILD ON THE EXCELLENT 
PROSTHETIC UNIT WHICH IS WORLD 
CLASS AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF 
LIFE FOR PEOPLE HERE 
YET THE MOVE 
COMES ONLY AFTER CHARITIES STEPPED 
IN TO HELP FUND A NEW BIGGER 
SWIMMING POOL FOR PATIENT WITH 
HELP FOR HEROES RAISED FIVE MILLION 
SO FAR REGARDLESS OF BUDGET THOSE 
BEING TREATED HERE HAVE NOTHING BUT 
PRAISE FOR HEADLEY COURT 
IT IS A 
GREAT PLACE I MEAN IT HAS GOT ME 
BACK ON MY FEET IT HAS MY DRIVING 
WHICH THEY SORTED OUT FOR ME L. 
HAVE HAD TO BUY A NEW HOUSE WHERE 
THEY HAVE COME OUT AND ENSURED IT 
IS FIT FOR ME TO LIVE IN 
THE EXTRA 
CASH WILL HELP EXPAND THE WORKSHOP 
AS WELL AS PROVIDING NEW 
ACCOMMODATION AND HI TECH EQUIPMENT 
BUT THE MOTHER OF BEN PARKINSON 
SAYS THE MONEY COMES TOO LATE 
WHILE IT IS PUNCHING WAY ABOVE ITS 
WEIGHT IT IS ACHIEVING MIRACLES 
THIS IS GOVERNMENT PLAYING CATCH UP 
AND TRYING TO PROVIDE THE FACILITYS 
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE ARE 
BEFORE WE EMBARKED ON THIS COURSE 
OF ACTION 
BRITAIN'S INVOLVEMENT IN 
LRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN IS UNLIKELY TO 
END SOON NOR WILL THE NEEDS OF 
BRITAIN'S INJURED TROOPS OUR TOP 
STORY CYCLONE NARGIS LEAVES AT 
LEAST FIFTEEN THOUSAND DEAD IN BURMA AID SON 
ITS WAY BUT CHARITIES SAY THE NEXT 
FEW DAYS ARE CRUCIAL COMING UP A 
NEW FREE TO 
VIEW SAT 
LIT TELEVISION 
SERVICE IS LAUNCHED BY THE B. B. C. AND 
I. T. V. LATER ON B. B. C. LONDON ONE OF 
THE BIGGEST SPECIALIST CHILD UNITS 
IN CENTRAL LONDON OPENS BUT SHOULD 
WE BE PAYING FOR IT AND MORE THAN 
TWO HUNDRED RESCUES IN A YEAR LONDON'S 
LIFEBOAT TEAM SHOW US WHERE THEY 
ARE MADE OF 
THERE ARE MORE C. C. T. V. CAMERAS ON THE 
STREETS OF THE U. K. THAN IN ANY OTHER 
COUNTRY IN EUROPE BUT A SENIOR 
POLICE OFFICER SAYS THAT DESPITE 
THE BILLIONS OF POUNDS SPENT ON 
INSTALLING THEM THEY HAVE FAILED 
TO CUT STREET CRIME DETECTIVE 
CHIEF INSPECTOR MICK NEVILLE SAYS 
THEY ARE NOT BEING USED EFFECTIVELY 
AND CRIMINALS ARE NOT SCARED OF 
BEING CAUGHT ON FILM ANY MORE 
THEY ARE WATCHING YOU FROM 
ROOFTOPS TO TRAFFIC GANTRIES 
HIDDEN OR CLEARLY VISIBLE THE 
NUMBER OF C. C. T. V. CAMERAS HAS 
MUSHROOMED IN RECENT YEARS MOST OF 
THEM ARE OWNED AND OPERATED 
PRIVATELY BUT THE MAN WHO RUNS THE 
METROPOLITAN POLICE VISUAL IMAGES 
UNIT SAYS ONLY A TINY MINORITY OF 
THE CITY'S ROBBERIES ARE SOLVED 
USING C. C. T. V. HE SAYS 
IT IS SOME YEARS SINCE THE 
INFORMATION COMMISSIONER WARNED 
THAT WE WERE IN DANGER OF 
SLEEPWALKING INTO A SURVEILLANCE 
SOCIETY SINCE THEN EVEN MORE HAVE 
BEEN INSTALLED THE QUESTION NOW 
BEING ASKED IS HOW USEFUL ARE THEY 
AT STOPPING CRIME THIS SENIOR 
POLICE OFFICER ADMITS THAT 
BRITAIN'S C. C. T. V. NETWORK HAS BEEN 
BUILT UP IN A PIECEMEAL WAY 
IF YOU 
RECOVER FINGERPRINT OR D. N. A. YOU CAN 
MATCH IT AGAINST NATIONAL DATABASES 
THERE IS NO NATIONAL DATABASE OF 
IMAGES OF PEOPLE THE DIFFICULTY WE 
HAVE IS TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHO OUR 
IMAGES ARE OF WE CAN DO BETTER 
THE UNTIL RECENTLY THE MAJOR 
SELLING POINT OF C. C. T. V. HAS BEEN ITS 
CLAIM TO BE A POWERFUL DETERRENT 
THAT SAYS THE INDUSTRY IS WHY IT 
IS POPULAR 
A MOST OF THE PRESSURE 
TO INSTALL MORE CAMERAS COMES FROM 
THE PUBLIC THEMSELVES THEY HAVE 
SEEN HIS EFFECTIVENESS AND HOW 
USEFUL IT IS IN INVESTIGATIONS 
ITS EFFECTIVENESS EVEN IF IT DOES 
NOT WARRANT EXPENSE OF A C. C. T. V. 
CAMERA IN SOME PLACES THEY LIKE 
THE REASSURANCE 
THE POLICE SAY 
THAT IN FUTURE THEN EASTER DAY E. E. A. 
NATIONAL STANDARD FOR QUALITY OF 
IMAGE AND FORMAT OF THEIR NEEDS 
TO BE A NATIONAL STANDARD SO THAT 
DETECTION POSSIBILITIES ARE NOT 
MISSED MISSED THE UNITED STATES HILLARY CLINTON 
AND BARACK OBAMA ARE FIGHTING FOR 
THE LAST PRIMARIES IN THEIR BATTLE 
FOR THE U. S. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL 
NOMINATION IT WILL BE DIFFICULT 
FOR HILLARY CLINTON TO CARRY ON IF 
SHE LOSES IN THE OF INDIANA AND 
NORTH CAROLINA BUT SHE HAS BEEN 
FIGHTING BACK IN RECENT WEEKS IT 
IS NOT HER PICK UP TRUCK BUT 
HILLARY CLINTON IS ONCE AGAIN DOING 
ALL SHE CAN TO REACH OUT TO HER 
BASE WHITE WORKING CLASS VOTERS 
THIS TIME IN INDIANA AND NORTH 
CAROLINA THE MESSAGE I CAN FEEL 
YOUR PAIN EVEN AT THE PETROL PUMP 
THERE IS A NEW PROMISE OF HELP 
HILLARY ONCE THE OIL COMPANIES TO 
PAY FOR THE GAS TAX THIS SUMMER SO 
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HILLARY IS THE 
ONE WHO GETS IT BARACK OBAMA CALLS 
IT A BOGUS TAX CUT HE WAS THE 
CHOICE GIMMICKS OR BARRACK OBAMA 
BARACK OBAMA HAS BEEN CAUGHT IN THE 
SAME COURTING THE SAME VOTERS 
BUT SO FAR THEY HAVE YET TO BE 
CONVINCED BY HIS PROMISE OF CHANGE 
IN SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS THE ROW 
OVER HIS FORMER ROW HAS NOT HELPED 
IT IS HILLARY CLINTON WHO IS 
CLOSING THE GAP ONCE AGAIN 
AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO MAKE UP TWENTY PER CENT 
OF THE VOTERS IN NORTH CAROLINA 
COULD HELP DELIVER THAT STATE FOR 
BARACK OBAMA BUT HE DESPERATELY 
NEEDS TO BROADEN HIS APPEAL AMONG 
THE WHITE WORKING CLASS IF HE WANTS 
TO END THIS CONTEST QUICKLY 
THE POLES HAVE BEEN OPEN FOR JUST 
OVER AN HOUR NOW THE VOTING 
POLLS HAVE BEEN OPENED IT HAS BEEN 
A TREMENDOUS FIGHT BUT EXHAUSTING 
FOR ALL CONCERNED HOW IS THE MOOD 
AT THE MOMENT 
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF 
ANTICIPATION IN AT BARACK OBAMA'S 
CAMP THEY ARE HOPING THEY CAN 
DELIVER THE KNOCKOUT BLOW TO 
HILLARY CLINTON IF BARACK OBAMA IS 
ABLE TO WIN THESE TWO BIG STATES 
THAT ARE VOTING TODAY INDIANA AND 
NORTH CAROLINA IT WILL BE VERY 
HARD FOR HILLARY CLINTON TO 
CONTINUE BUT HILLARY CLINTON IS AT 
HER BEST WHEN HER BACK IS AGAINST 
THE WALL AND SHE IS IN TROUBLE SHE 
IS FIGHTING BACK STRONGLY THERE IS 
NO GUARANTEE THAT SHE WILL LOSE 
THESE TWO STATES 
WE WILL HAVE THE RESULTS FOR YOU

PARLIAMENT ARE MEETING THIS 
LUNCHTIME TO DISCUSS THE SCOTTISH 
LABOUR LEADER'S CALL AT THE WEEKEND

TRY TO OUTSMART AND WRONG FOOT THE 
S. N. P. THE S. N. P. FOR THEIR PART SAY 
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD A MULTI 
OPTION REFERENDUM IN TWO THOUSAND TEN THEY 
COULD IN THEORY BRING FORWARD THE 
BUILD UP TO THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT 
TO HOLD A REFERENDUM AND WITH 
LABOUR SUPPORT THEY WOULD GET IT 
THROUGH BUT THEY WILL HOLD THAT 
REFERENDUM IN TWO THOUSAND TEN THAT 
CALCULATION IS THAT THEY WILL HAVE 
A COUPLE MORE YEARS TO PROVE TO THE 
SCOTTISH PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE A 
GOOD PARTY IN GOVERNMENT AND BY 
THEN THERE MAY HAVE BEEN AN 
ELECTION AT WESTMINSTER AND A 
CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT TO THE TORIES 
THEY RECKON THOSE FACTORS WOULD 
HELP THEM WIN ANY INDEPENDENCE

INDEPENDENCE 
THAT DEPENDS WHICH INDEPENDENCE POLL YOU READ AND HOW THE QUESTIONS 
ARE PHRASED THERE WERE TWO POLES

STATUS QUO FORTY PER CENT MORE RECENTLY 
THOSE POLLS HAVE SUGGESTED SUPPORT 
FOR INDEPENDENCE THE QUESTION DO 
YOU WANT SCOTLAND TO REMOVE ITSELF 
FROM THE REST OF THE U. K. DEPENDING 
ON HOW YOU WERE THAT THE SUPPORT 
DROPS TO TWENTY PER CENT IN THE MOST RECENT 
POLL EVEN LOWER THAN THAT 
HUNDREDS OF RAIL PASSENGERS WERE

MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF BEANS 
MANGETOUT AND BABY CORN ARE PICKED 
PACKED AND DISPATCHED TO THE U. K. 
FROM KENYA EVERY DAY TO PROVIDE THE 
BRITISH SHOPPER WITH YEAR ROUND 
FRESH PRODUCE IT IS A REMARKABLE 
LOGISTICS OPERATION AND A VITAL 
SOURCE OF FOREIGN REVENUE FOR KENYA 
WHAT DEMANDS DOES THE CUSTOMER 
PLACE ON YOU ABOUT THE SIZE AND 
QUALITY 
THE CUSTOMER HAS SPECIFIED QUALITY LENGTH FOR EXAMPLE HERE IF IT IS 
LESS THAN SIX CENTIMETRES IT IS 
UNDERSIZE IT IS REJECTED U. K. U. K. SUPERMARKETS HAVE EXACTING 
STANDARDS THEY INSIST THAT 
VEGETABLES GET FROM FIELD THE TABLE 
IN PERFECT CONDITION AND AT 
LIGHTNING SPEED THIS BEEN WILL BE 
PICKED IN A FEW MINUTES WITHIN 
HOURS IT WILL HAVE BEEN WEIGHED 
PACKED AND ON ITS WAY TO THE U. K. 
WHERE IT WILL BE ON THE SUPERMARKET 
SHELF WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS NOW THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR HAS BEEN ASKED TO 
HELP THE DEVELOPING WORLD TO MEET 
MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS LIKE 
CUTTING WORLD POVERTY GETTING 
CHILDREN INTO SCHOOL AND IMPROVING 
ACCESS TO WATER THE SUPERMARKET 
CHAIN ASDA HAS UNDERTAKEN TO 
INCREASE BY TWENTY PER CENT THE AMOUNT OF 
PRODUCE IT SOURCES FROM KENYA ITS 
MAIN SUPPLIER IN THE COUNTRY COULD 
MORE THAN MEET THE EXTRA DEMAND WE WE HAVE OUR OWN FARMS WE ARE NOT 
EXPLOITED WE HAVE BIG GROWERS WHO 
HAVE A LOT OF SPACE AND CAPACITY TO 
INCREASE ANY TONNAGES OF THE 
PRODUCTION THAT THE SUPERMARKETS 
WANT 
MANY AGRICULTURAL WORKERS IN WANT KENYA ARE LITTLE MORE EARN UP 
LITTLE MORE THAN ONE A DAY THEY 
SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES ON THIS ANY 
THIS INCOME ANY EXTRA REVENUE 
WILL GO A LONG WAY 
THE GOVERNMENT WANTS US ALL TO 
SWITCH OVER TO DIGITAL TELEVISION 
TODAY A NEW DIGITAL SATELLITE 
SERVICE HAS BEEN LAUNCHED TO HELP 
US MAKE THE CHANGE THE B. B. C. AND I. T. V. 
HAVE JOINTLY LAUNCHED FREESAT A 
FREE TO AIR SATELLITE SERVICE WHICH 
SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO NINETY EIGHT PER CENT OF U. K. 
HOMES WHAT WILL IT OFFER 
YET ANOTHER NEW DIGITAL T. V. SERVICE 
THE BOSSES AT THE B. B. C. AND I. T. V. SEEM 
PROUD OF THEIR NEW BABY BUT WHO 
WILL WANT FREESAT IT MAY PROVE 
POPULAR IN THE DORSET VILLAGE OF 
BRIDPORT WHERE YOU CANNOT GET 
DIGITAL TELEVISION DOWN AN AERIAL 
BILL IS ONE OF A SURPRISING NUMBER 
OF PEOPLE ACROSS BRITAIN WHO STILL 
STRUGGLE TO GET A DIGITAL SIGNAL 
AND THERE WILL INSTALL CAME ROUND 
TO CHECK THE SIGNAL FOR US WHAT 
COULD HE GET ABSOLUTELY NOTHING 
FREESAT WHICH LAUNCHES TODAY WILL 
BE AVAILABLE IN ALMOST EVERY HOME 
IN BRITAIN OFFERING EIGHTY CHANNELS 
NOW AND TWO HUNDRED BY THE END OF THE YEAR 
A DISH AND BOX WILL COST ONE HUNDRED THIRTY 
WHILE YOU WILL PAY AROUND TWO HUNDRED TO 
GET H. D. T. V. IT IS HIGH DEFINITION 
TELEVISION WHICH IS ONE OF 
FREESAT'S MAIN SELLING POINTS 
AROUND TEN MILLION PEOPLE ALREADY 
HAVE AN H. D. READY SET LIKE THIS 
BUT JUST HALF A MILLION ACTUALLY 
GET HIGH DEFINITION MAINLY THROUGH 
SKY SO THIS NEW SERVICE WILL BRING 
THE B. B. C. AND I. T. V. HEAD TO HEAD WITH 
B. SKY B. SKY POINTS OUT THAT IT HAS 
BEEN OFFERED A FREE SATELLITE 
SERVICE WITH TWO HUNDRED DIGITAL CHANNELS 
FOR FOUR YEARS BUT THE B. B. C. SAYS 
THAT SERVICE IS AIMED AT BRINGING 
YOU PAYING CUSTOMERS 
FREESAT IS 
STRAIGHTFORWARD WE ARE NOT TRYING 
TO GET PEOPLE TO SUBSCRIBE IT IS A 
SIMPLE PROPOSITION AND WITH I. T. V. 
THE B. B. C. AND OTHER FUTURE PARTNERS 
BEHIND IT WE THINK THAT 
PROPOSITION WILL HELP 
IT WILL NOW 
BE A NEW WAY FOR MILLIONS OF 
VIEWERS TO SEE HIGH DEFINITION 
TELEVISION BUT SKY SAYS IT IS HARD 
TO SEE WHY THE B. B. C. NEEDS TO SPEND 
PUBLIC MONEY ON ANOTHER SERVICE 
IT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED THAT AND SO 
ON NELSON MANDELA WILL MAKE WHAT 
IS NOW A RARE PUBLIC APPEARANCE IN 
LONDON NEXT MONTH AT A CONCERT TO
