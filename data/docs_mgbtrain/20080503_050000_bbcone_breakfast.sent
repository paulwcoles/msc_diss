CLOWN BORIS THE BUFFOON A MAN 
DEFINED BY HIS HAIR BUT HE NOW 
RUNS ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT 
CAPITALS 
IT IS A DISGRACE IN CAPITALS LONDON YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE 
MUGGED ON OUR STREETS THAN IN NEW 
YORK 
LONDON HAS A CELEBRITY YORK MAYOR A CELEBRITY POLITICIAN 
OFTEN UNGUARDED 
I WOULD HAVE TO 
COME UP WITH AN APPALLING GAFFE TO 
BLOW IT 
HE WAS BRED FOR PUBLIC LIFE 
GLIDING FROM ETON TO OXFORD I I DECLARE THE MOTION OVERWHELMINGLY 
CARRIED AND THEY CLOSE THE HOUSE AT 
HE WAS A JOURNALIST POLITICIAN MADE FAMOUS BY APPEARING 
ON TELEVISION SHOWS LIKE HAVE I GOT 
NEWS FOR YOU 
HE WILL BE BRITAIN'S 
NEXT PRIME MINISTER AT EON WE ALL 
KNOW IT IS GOING TO BE YOU BORIS 
THERE WERE GAPS AND APOLOGIES HE 
UPSET LIVERPUDLIANS SNIPED AT 
JAMIE OLIVER AND THE PEOPLE OF 
PAPUA NEW GUINEA IN CHIEF KILLING 
HAD AN AFFAIR AND LOST HIS JOB 
THE SLOGAN OVER HIS CAMPAIGN WAS 
IS BORIS JOHNSON SERIOUS DOES HE 
REALLY WANT TO RUN LONDON 
I HAVE 
BEEN LOCKED OUT 
ELEVEN BILLION IS A 
LOT OF MONEY TO PUT HIM IN CHARGE 
OF HE IS NOT A DETAIL MAN HE IS 
NOT SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO MICRO 
MANAGE THAT BUDGET L. SUSPECT IF 
HE DEVELOPS A GREAT STRENGTH IT 
WILL BE THAT HE WILL PUT COULD 
PEOPLE IN TO DO THE WORK FOR HIM 
HIS FATHER STANLEY WHO TOLD ME HE 
CAME FROM A LINE OF BLONDE TURKISH 
PEOPLE WERE CERTAIN HIS SON WANTED 
THE JOB 
I HAVE BEEN AMAZINGLY 
IMPRESSED BY THE DETERMINATION HE 
HAS SHOWN HE HAS NOT RUN FOR THREE 
MONTHS IF YOU GIVE UP DRINK FOR 
THREE MONTHS YOU HAVE TO BE 
SERIOUS DRUNK HE HAS ISSUED 
OBVIOUS JOKES AND HE IS A NATURAL 
HUMORIST 
AS THE CAMPAIGN WENT ON HUMORIST BORIS JOHNSON APPEARED MORE 
DISCIPLINE HE DISCOVERED A PASSION 
ABOUT BEING THE MAYOR WHAT HE HAD 
GOING WAS THAT HE STOOD FOR CHANGE 
AGAINST A MAN WHO HAD BEEN IN POWER 
FOR EIGHT YEARS 
HE IS EXCITING 
NEW VERY WELL KNOWN HE DID WELL 
AMONG THE YOUNG PEOPLE THEY LACKED 
THE ELEMENT IN BORIS JOHNSON THAT 
WAS LIKE KEN AND WINSTON USED TO BE 
IRREVERENT MISCHIEVOUS AND FUNNY 
IF HE EMBARRASSES AND FAILS TO 
MEASURE UP IT COULD DAMAGE DAVID 
CAMERON'S EFFORTS TO REBRAND HIS 
PARTY 
BORIS HAS PROVED DURING THIS PARTY CAMPAIGN WHEN THE SERIOUS CHIPS 
ARE DOWN HE CAN PLAY THE GAME LIKE 
ANYBODY ELSE HE KNOWS IT IS 
IMPORTANT THE CONSERVATIVES WIN THE 
ELECTION IN TWO THOUSAND TEN 
BORIS JOHNSON 
THE MAN MANY REGARD IT AS A GAMBLE 
BY HIS PARTY HAS DELIVERED DAVID 
CAMERON THE MAJOR PRIZE OF A TORY 
LONDON BUT BORIS MAKES GOOD COPY 
T. V. AND OUT THERE THERE WILL BE 
THOSE WATCHING FOR EVERY SLIP OR 
MISTAKE MISTAKE VICKY YOUNG HAS BEEN WATCHING THE 
DEVELOPMENTS IT IS FASCINATING THE 
SITUATION SO MANY PEOPLE DID NOT 
TAKE HIS CAMPAIGN SERIOUSLY WHEN IT 
STARTED STARTED PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK HE COULD WIN 
BUT ACCORDING TO THOSE CLOSE TO HIM 
HE WORKED HARD TO GET IT FOR THE 
CONSERVATIVES THIS CAPPED A GREAT 
DAY FOR THEM A GREAT SET OF 
ELECTION RESULTS TO NOW GET THIS 
PRIZE IS WONDERFUL DAVID CAMERON 
WAS THRILLED WE CAN SEE HIM 
REACTING TO THE NEWS HE WAS 
WATCHING IT AT TORY CENTRAL OFFICE 
ON A BIG SCREEN TAKE LOOK AT THIS THIS I THEREFORE OFFICIALLY DECLARE 
BORIS JOHNSON 
WELL DONE FANTASTIC IT WAS SO 
DRAWN OUT IT WAS AGONY HE HAS 
DONE BRILLIANTLY 
DAVID CAMERON 
TALKING ABOUT HIS AGONY WATCHING 
THAT BUT THE REAL PERSON IN AGONY 
WAS SITTING SOMEWHERE ELSE 
GORDON BROWN DOES NOT HAVE COULD 
NOT HAVE GOOD DAY PEOPLE DO NOT 
THINK IT WOULD BE THIS BAD LOSING 
OVER THREE HUNDRED SEAT THERE WILL BE SOME 
SEEDS WHO WILL BE LOST AT A GENERAL 
ELECTION AND THAT CAUSES A PROBLEM 
IT IS WHETHER THE M. P.'S THINK HE IS 
THE MAN TO LEAD THEM FORWARD MANY 
SAY HE HAS GOT UNTIL THE CONFERENCE 
GETTING RID OF A LEADER IS 
DIFFICULT UNLESS YOU DO IT AT THE 
CONFERENCE THOSE CLOSE TO GORDON 
BROWN ARE HOPING THE ECONOMY TURNS 
AROUND AND THE DOWNTURNS ARE NOT AS 
BAD AS THEY FEARED UNDER MORE 
SCRUTINY PEOPLE LIKE BORIS JOHNSON 
AND DAVID CAMERON WILL BE EXPOSED 
THEY SAY THEY ARE SHALLOW AND HAVE 
NO POLICIES 
FOREST GORDON BROWN 
SAID HE IS HERE TO LISTEN AND LEAD 
IF HE CHANGES POLICY AS A RESULT OF 
THIS HE CAN BE ACCUSED OF WEAKNESS 
YES HE HAS A PROBLEM HE SAYS HE 
WILL LISTEN HE HAS LEFT WINGERS IN 
HIS PARTY WHO WANT HIM TO 
RENATIONALISE THE TRAINS GO TO THE 
LEFT WHICH HE IS NOT GOING TO DO 
THERE ARE OTHERS WHO WANT HIM TO BE 
TONY BLAIR THAT IS NOT GOING TO 
HAPPEN EITHER HE HAS DECISION TO 
MAKE AND HE HAS A TEST COMING UP 
WITH THE FORTY TODAY POLICY 
WITHHOLDING TERROR SUSPECTS WITHOUT 
CHARGE FOR THAT LONG FORTY TWO DAY 
POLICY HE SAYS HE IS GOING TO GO 
AHEAD WITH THAT AND RISK DEFEAT 
THOSE CLOSE TO HIM SAID HE WILL GO 
FORWARD AND RISK DEFEAT AS TONY 
BLAIR WAS HE SAID HE CANNOT BE 
PUSHED AROUND BY HIS LABOUR 
BACKBENCHERS HE SAYS HE WANTS TO 
LISTEN AND LEAD A LOT OF PEOPLE 
SAY HE SHOULD LISTEN AND LEAVE 
WE'LL LOOK BACK OVER KEN 
LIVINGSTONE'S CAREER IN POLITICS 
AFTER HALF PAST YOU CAN SEND US 
ALL YOUR THOUGHTS THE WAYS OF 
GETTING IN TOUCH THEY SHOULD BE ON 
THE SCREEN NOW TIME NOW IS SIX TO SIXTEEN 
THIS IS B. B. C. NEWS THE HEADLINES 
BORIS JOHNSON HAS WON THE RACE TO 
BECOME THE NEXT MAYOR OF LONDON 
THERE WILL BE CHURCH SERVICES IN 
PORTUGAL AND IN LEICESTERSHIRE 
TODAY TO MARK THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MADELEINE 
MCCANN STILL TO COME THEY ARE 
BUBBLING OVER IN BELGIUM ODDBOX 
LOOKS AT THE WEEK'S WEIRDER NEWS 
STORIES 
WE'LL LOOK AT OUR FIRST LOOK AT THE 
WEATHER THIS MORNING MATT IS THERE 
FOR US THIS MORNING 
BIT OF SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE WE 
SHOULD ALL SEE THE SUN AT SOME 
POINT BUT ALSO RAIN A LITTLE RAIN 
MAINLY TO THE THE WEST EVEN WITH 
THAT MOST WILL NOTICE IT FEELS 
THAT LITTLE BIT WARMER THE REASON 
WE HAVE GOT WARMER AIR WITH US 
HIGH PRESSURE TO THE EAST WE ARE 
DRAGGING IN THE WINDS FROM THE 
SOUTH FAIRLY WARM BUT WITH LOW 
PRESSURE LURKING THAT IS THE REASON 
FOR THE RAIN IT'S COMING FROM THE 
SHEET OF CLOUD WHICH HAS BEEN 
SPILLING IN THROUGH THE NIGHT IT'S 
NOT DESPERATELY THICK THE CLOUD SO 
ANY RAIN THAT HAS FALLEN IS FAIRLY 
LIGHT AND PATCHY THAT WILL BE THE 
CASE DURING THE MID MORNING IN THE 
WEST OF SCOTLAND OUT TO THE EAST 
THE CLOUD THIN ENOUGH TO ALLOW SOME 
SUN THROUGH PERHAPS NORTH WEST 
ENGLAND CLOUDY AND INTO THE 
MIDLANDS THE FURTHER EAST YOU ARE 
THE BRIGHTER YOUR DAY WILL BE I'M 
NOT PROMISING WALL TO WALL SUNSHINE 
THERE WILL BE A FAIR AMOUNT OF 
CLOUD IN THE SKIES BUT THIN ENOUGH 
TO ALLOW THE SUN THROUGH 
TEMPERATURES ARE ALREADY CLIMBING 
TO THE MID TEENS BY ONE THOUSAND BIT MORE 
IN THE WAY OF CLOUD TO THE WEST OF 
ENGLAND IN SOUTH WALES A BIT OF 
RAIN NOTHING DESPERATELY HEAVY 
SLIGHTLY DAMPER IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
THE BREEZE WILL PICK UP THE SOUTH 
EASTERLY WINDS WILL BE QUITE FRESH 
ALWAYS THE CHANCE OF SOME RAIN TO 
THE WEST AND IF ANYTHING THE CLOUD 
WILL THICKEN UP FURTHER DURING THE 
AFTERNOON SO SKIES WILL BE A TOUCH 
GREYER IN THE EAST IT SHOULD BE 
DRY AND IN THE BRIGHTER MOMENTS IT 
WILL FEEL QUITE WARM THROUGH 
TONIGHT WE HOLD ON TO THE MILD 
THEME WINDS STILL COMING IN FROM 
THE SOUTH A BIT MORE RAIN AROUND 
IT WILL TURN A TOUCH HEAVIER ACROSS 
THE WEST LATER ON EASTERN AREAS 
THEY WILL BE REASONABLY DRY 
TEMPERATURES NOT DROPPING TOO MUCH 
FOR TOMORROW GENERALLY A CLOUDY 
START FOR MANY THERE COULD BE A 
FEW GLIMPSES OF BRIGHTNESS IN THE 
SOUTH EAST AND THAT WILL CONTINUE 
ON AND OFF DURING THE DAY IF 
ANYTHING THE RAIN THAT DOES FALL 
WILL BE A BIT HEAVIER BRIGHTENING 
UP LATER FOR NORTHERN IRELAND 
TEMPERATURES CLIMBING INTO THE HIGH 
TEENS BY BANK HOLIDAY MONDAY IT 
LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE THE BEST 
FAVOURED FOR THE THE SUNNY SPELLS 
WE ALL GET A BIT OF SUN EASTERN 
AREAS CLOUDY AND DAMP AND 
TEMPERATURES STILL UP AROUND TWENTY 
BACK TO YOU 
STUDENTS MAY BE PAYING BACK TOO 
MUCH MONEY BECAUSE THE LOAN SYSTEM 
IS FLAWED ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL 
UNION OF STUDENTS OVER TWENTY FIVE MILLION 
HAVE TAKEN OUT STUDENT LOANS BUT 
BREAKFAST HAS FOUND OUT THAT 
GRADUATES ARE STILL BEING ASKED FOR 
PAYMENTS AFTER THEY'VE CLEARED 
THEIR LOAN IN FULL 
WHILE MANY WORRY ABOUT PAYING BACK 
THEIR LOAN SOME LIKE KATY LANGHAM 
HAVE A DIFFERENT PROBLEM SHE'S 
PAID BACK TOO MUCH NOW SHE IS 
TRYING TO GET A REFUND FROM THE 
STUDENT LOANS COMPANY 
I THINK THE 
WHOLE SYSTEM IS VERY FRUSTRATING 
FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME AND I THINK 
THERE THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW 
THEY HAVE TO CALL THE STUDENT LOANS 
COMPANY TO TELL THEM THEY HAVE 
FINISHED PAYING THE LOAN L. THINK 
I'VE OVERPAID BY AROUND TWO THOUSAND 
I'VE ONLY RECEIVED ONE THOUSAND TO DATE 
AND I DON'T KNOW IF WHEN I GET THAT 
IT'S THE FULL AMOUNT I'M DUE THE THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED MEANS 
THAT ANY GRADUATE WHO HAS LOAN 
REPAYMENTS TAKEN FROM THEIR WAGES 
IS AT RISK OF PAYING TOO MUCH IN IN THIS RESPECT THE SYSTEM IS FLAWED 
IT IS POSSIBLE FOR ANY BORROWER TO 
OVERPAY ON THE DEBT THEY HAVE 
SIMPLY BECAUSE THE COMPANY DOESN'T 
HAVE THAT INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
REPAYMENTS FROM ONE THE END OF 
ONE TAX YEAR TO THE NEXT THE THE SYSTEM WAS CHANGED TEN YEARS AGO 
SO THAT WHEN A STUDENT LEAVES 
UNIVERSITY AND STARTS WORKING FOR 
AN EMPLOYER MONEY THEY OWE ON THE 
LOAN CAN BE TAKEN FROM THEIR WAGE 
PACKET THE PROBLEM IS THEY ARE 
ONLY SENT A STATEMENT SAYING HOW 
MUCH THEY OWE ONCE A YEAR BY THE 
TIME THEY GET THE STATEMENT THE 
INFORMATION IS MONTHS OUT OF DATE 
THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT IF NOT 
IMPOSSIBLE TO CHECK HOW MUCH THEY 
OWE 
BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WORKS OUT OWE WHETHER YOU OWE MONEY OR NOT IT 
DOES MEAN THAT YOU COULD JUST OWE 
ONE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TAX YEAR 
AND THEN IT WILL CARRY ON TAKING 
MONEY RELATIVE TO YOUR INCOME SO 
IT MIGHT CARRY ON TAKING TENS TWENTIES 
HUNDREDS EACH MONTH 
THE GOVERNMENT 
DENIES THE SYSTEM IS FLAWED BUT IS 
INTRODUCING IMPROVEMENTS FROM 
SEPTEMBER 
I'VE INSTRUCTED THE SEPTEMBER COMPANY TO MAKE FURTHER REFORMS AND 
AS FROM NEXT YEAR STUDENTS WILL BE 
ABLE TO PREDICT WHEN THEIR 
REPAYMENTS ARE DUE TO CREASE AND 
STEP OUT OF THE AUTOMATIC SYSTEM 
AND REPAY MANUALLY THROUGH DIRECT 
DEBIT 
CHANGES SHOULD MEAN FAR DEBIT FEWER GRADUATES OVERPAY ON THEIR 
STUDENT LOAN BUT THE ONUS WILL 
STILL BE ON THE BORROWER TO MONITOR 
THEIR ACCOUNT AS THE NEW SYSTEM 
WON'T AUTOMATICALLY STOP TAKING 
PAYMENTS ONCE THE LOAN'S BEEN PAID 
IN FULL WE'LL SPEAK TO A FINANCIAL 
EXPECT AFTER NINE HUNDRED THIS MORNING YOU 
CAN SEND US YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS 
IN THE USUAL WAYS NOW PRESIDENT 
BUSH CONDUCTING PENGUINS AND MEN 
POSING AND COLA EXPLODING IT'S

SNOOKER HIS SAFETY PLAY WAS 
UNBELIEVABLE THE ONLY TIMES I CAME 
TO THE TABLE WAS TO BREAK OFF OR 
CLAY FROM AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION 
YOU HAVE TO LOOK BACK AND ADMIRE IT 
BECAUSE IT WAS PERFECT SNOOKER 
HIS OPPONENT IN THE FINAL MIGHT 
HAVE TO BRING A GOOD BOOK AT THE 
MOMENT IT IS LIKELY TO BE ALI 
CARTER HE HAS THE EDGE IN THE 
SEMI FINAL AGAINST JOE PERRY HE 
DOMINATED BEFORE THE INTERVAL AND 
WON THE FIRST FOUR FRAMES TO LEAD 
SEVEN TO FIVE HE RETURNS TO THE TABLE TO 
TAKE THE NEXT ONE AS WELL JOE 
PERRY RESPONDED AND PLAYED SOME 
SUPERB SHOT HIMSELF BUT CARTER 
CLEARED UP AND COVERAGE IS ON THE 
RED BUTTON AND ON THE B. B. C. SPORT 
WEBSITE AND ON B. B. C. TWO THIS 
AFTERNOON AFTERNOON FOR BALL ON A DAY OF RECKONING IN 
THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE WE COULD SEE 
BOURNEMOUTH PAUL OF THE GREATEST OF 
THE STAKES ESCAPES NOTTINGHAM 
FOREST ARE BAFFLING AT DONCASTER 
IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP TWENTY THREE YEARS OF 
WAITING COULD BE OVER FOR STOKE AT 
THE BOTTOM ANY OF FIVE TEAMS COULD 
GO DOWN 
MANCHESTER UNITED COULD WIN THE 
TITLE TODAY IF THEY BEAT WEST HAM 
AT THE BOTTOM SIX TEAMS ARE STILL 
IN THE FIGHT TO AVOID THE NEXT TWO 
RELEGATION SPOT THE GAME AT CRAVEN 
COTTAGE AGAINST FULHAM AND 
BIRMINGHAM WILL BE LIKE A CUP FINAL 
TODAY TODAY ROY HODSON LOOKING VERY 
DISAPPOINTED 
AT FOUR P. M. LAST DISAPPOINTED SATURDAY HE LOOKED A BROKEN MAN 
HIS FULHAM TEAM WERE TWO TO ZERO DOWN AND 
HEADING FOR RELEGATION THAT WAS 
UNTIL THE COMEBACK OF THE SEASON 
HER HE SCORED A WONDERFUL 
WONDERFUL GOAL FOR FULL ON AND THEY 
ARE GOING TO TAKE ALL THREE POINTS 
AND THE GREAT ESCAPE IS DEFINITELY 
ON ON CERTAINLY IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO 
GET THAT VICTORY AND TO GIVE 
OURSELVES CHANCE IT IS SMALL 
CHANCE IT IS A VERY VERY 
DIFFICULT JOB BECAUSE WE ARE THREE 
POINTS BEHIND OUR RIVALS WITH ONLY 
TWO MATCHES LEFT 
AT LEAST THEY ARE 
STILL IN IT HEAD OF WHAT IS SET TO 
BE A PIVOTAL MATCH PHRASES LIKE 
MUST WIN GAMES AND RELEGATION SIX 
POINTER AS ARE SOMETIMES OVER USED 
BUT NOT AT CRAVEN COTTAGE BY THE 
END OF TODAY EITHER FALLEN OR 
BIRMINGHAM COULD BE DOWN 
ALEX MCLEISH'S SIDE LET SLIP A TWO TO ZERO 
GOAL LEAD TO LIVERPOOL LAST WEEKEND 
AND SOME FANS ARE FEARING THE WORST 
FALLEN AWAY AND BLACKBURN AT HOMES 
NOT THE EASIEST GAMES BUT LOOK AT 
THE OTHER TEAMS IN TROUBLE AND THEY 
HAVE EQUALLY TOUGH GAMES IT IS ALL 
DOWN TO BIRMINGHAM AM SURE IF 
THEY PLAYED TO THEIR POTENTIAL THEY 
CAN DO IT L. AM NOT CONVINCED 
IF THE MANAGERS WILL BE HOLDING 
THEIR BREATH SO WILL THE FANS A 
MATCH TO TEST THE TOUGHEST 
FINGERNAILS IS ABOUT THE ONLY 
GUARANTEE GUARANTEE BEFORE GOING ON TO SCOTLAND IT IS 
A WEEKEND OF DESTINY IN LEAGUE ONE 
ISSUES WILL BE SETTLED TODAY AND 
THE CHAMPIONSHIP MATCHES A ALL 
TOMORROW THE LIKES OF STOKE 
SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY AND SOUTHAMPTON 
BUT THE LEAGUE ONE MATCHES ARE 
TODAY TODAY TODAY CELTIC COULD MOVE A POINT 
CLEAR OF RANGERS IN THE TITLE RACE 
EVEN THOUGH THE UEFA CUP FINALISTS 
WILL HAVE FOUR GAMES IN HAND 
RANGERS PLAY HIBS TOMORROW 
WE ARE PLAYING ON A SURFACE NOT 
CONDUCIVE FOR GREAT FOOTBALL THE 
LAST TIME WE PLAYED THERE I LOOKED 
AT THE GAME AGAIN AND WE ACTUALLY 
PLAYED SOME HALF DECENT STUFF AT 
TIMES ON SURFACE THAT WAS NOT 
CONDUCIVE TO GOOD FOOTBALL WE WILL 
TRY TO PLAY GOOD FOOTBALL TOMORROW 
BUT IF NOT CREATE AS MANY CHANCES 
AS WE CAN THROUGH THE WAYS 
RUGBY UNION CARDIFF BLUES KEPT

WORSE UNIVERSITIES AND PROSPECTIVE 
EMPLOYERS HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN

THIS WAS YOUR PROFILE PICTURE YOU 
MAY BE THINKING I'M FINE THE ONLY

I'VE CHANGED MY SETTINGS SO NOTHING 
IS VISIBLE TO THE PUBLIC AND ONLY 
MY CLOSEST CIRCLE OF FRIENDS CAN 
SEE MY DETAILS YOU MAY THINK THAT 
YOUR INFORMATION IS SAFE AND SECURE 
YOU'D BE WRONG WE HAVE LOOKED 
CLOSELY AT FACEBOOK AND FOUND 
SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A SERIOUS 
GAP IN ITS SECURITY AND WE'LL TELL 
YOU ALL ABOUT IT AFTER THE LATEST 
TECH NEWS NVIDIA IS DEVELOPING A 
GRAPHICS DRIVER TO ALLOW A GAME TO 
RUN IN THREE D. IT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO 
PEOPLE IN THE SUMMER WITH ANYONE 
WITH A COME PATTIVE THREE D. SPECKS AND 
COMPATIBLE P. C. L. PLAYER IS 
AVAILABLE ON T. V. OR AT LEAST TO 
VIRGIN MEDIA THIRTY FIVE MILLION CABLE 
SUBSCRIBERS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY HOURS OF CONTENT 
IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE WITH MORE IN 
THE PIPELINE FINALLY CANADIAN 
BUREAUCRATS ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR 
HOWITT OF HOURS USE OF BLACKARIES 
SO THE BLACKBERRIES THE UNIONS 
ARE CALLING FOR LEGISLATION 
NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOW IN PROGRESS 
FACEBOOK IS THE DARLING OF THE 
MOMENT THE SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE 
THAT HELPS YOU STAY IN TOUCH WITH 
FLENDS POST PHOTOGRAPHS AND SHARE 
FUN GAMES AND QUIZZES FRIENDS 
AND IF YOU WANT YOU CAN KEEP YOUR 
PERSONAL DETAILS PRIVATE FROM THE 
REST OF THE WORLD OR AT LEAST 
THAT'S THE IMPLICATION BUT WE'VE 
DISCOVERED A WAY TO STEAL THE 
PERSONAL DETAILS OF YOU AND ALL 
YOUR FACEBOOK FRIENDS WITHOUT YOU 
KNOW EVEN THOUGH THESE PEOPLE HAVE 
ASKED FACEBOOK TO SHOW MINIMAL 
DETAILS TO PEOPLE THEY DON'T KNOW 
WE'VE GOT A THE LOT MORE HERE'S A 
PROFILE WE MADE UP FOR THE TEST 
BOB SMITH KEEPS MOST OF HIS DETAILS 
HERE'S ANOTHER PUBLIC PROFILE AND 
HERE'S THE DATA WE MANAGED TO 
RETRIEVE HOW DID WE DO IT WELCOME 
TO THE CLICK LABS WHICH TO BE 
HONEST IS JUST A COUPLE OF LAPTOPS 
AND A BIG PURPLE LIGHT NEVER THE 
LETS NEVERTHELESS THIS IS WHERE 
PETE CREATED A SPECIAL APPLICATION 
FOR FACEBOOKERS TO ADD ONE OF THE 
REASONS IT HAS BECOME SO POPULAR SO 
QUICKLY IS BECAUSE OF THE WEALTH OF 
APPLICATIONS USERS CAN ADD TO THEIR 
PROFILE PAGES LITTLE GAMES 
QUIZZES I. Q. TESTS THERE ARE 
THOUSANDS OF THEM AVAILABLE AND 
ONCE YOU HAVE ADDED AN APPLICATION 
YOUR FRIENDS ARE ENCOURAGED TO ADD 
IT TOO AND ANYONE WITH A BASIC 
UNDERSTANDING OF WEB PROGRAMMING 
CAN WRITE ONE SO WE WROTE AN EVIL 
DATA MINING APPLICATION CALLED THE 
MINER WHICH IF WE WANTED COULD 
MASQUERADE AS A GAME TESTING OR A 
JOKE OF THE DAY BUT WHATEVER IT 
LOOKED LIKE IN THE BACKGROUND IT 
IS COLLECTING YOUR PERSONAL DETAILS 
AND THOSE OF ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND 
EMAILING THEM OUT OF FACEBOOK TO 
OUR INBOX SEE WHEN YOU ADD AN 
APPLICATION NLGS YOU SAY OTHERWISE 
IT IS GIVEN ACCESS TO MOST OF THE 
INFORMATION IN YOUR PROFILE 
INFORMATION THAT INCLUDES INFO YOU 
HAVE ON YOUR FRIENDS EVEN IF THEY 
HAVE REALLY TIGHT SECURITY SETTINGS 
DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S 
SECURITY NOW MANY APPLICATIONS DO 
NEED ACCESS TO YOUR DETAILS IN 
ORDER TO WORK PROPERLY WE DON'T 
KNOW OF ANY WHICH DO ABUSE USER 
INFORMATION APART FROM OURS OF 
COURSE IF ONE DID WHO'S CHECKING 
WELL THE EXPERTS WE HAVE SPOKEN TO 
ALL AGREE THAT FACEBOOK CAN'T SEE 
WHAT THE CODE DOES THE THE 
APPLICATIONS ARE THE NOT STORED IN 
FACEBOOK THEY RUN ELSEWHERE ON THE 
WEB PAUL DOHERTY IS A SECURITY 
ADVISER TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT 
WE ASKED HIM FOR HIS OPINION ON 
THIS APPARENT SECURITY PROBLEM 
LEGALLY I THINK FACEBOOK ARE O. K. 
THEY HAVE A STATEMENT WHICH ALLOWS 
THEM TO PASS DETAILS TO USERS AND 
USERS TO PUT DETAILS INTO THE 
SYSTEM AND FROM THERE OTHER USERS 
WHO DEVELOP APPLICATIONS TO EXPORT 
THE DATA FROM THAT IT'S THEN THE 
USER'S CHOICE AS TO WHETHER THE 
APPLICATIONS FUNCTION THAT IS THE 
LEGAL GROUND WORK THAT I THINK 
COVERS THEM MORALLY I DON'T THINK 
THEY ARE SO COVERED L. THINK THEY 
HAVE BEEN NAIVE IN ALLOWING THE 
APPLICATIONS THAT PEOPLE CAN 
DEVELOP TO BE HOSTED IN A THIRD 
PARTY ENVIRONMENT AND TAKE AWAY 
DATA THAT IS PERSONAL TO USERS AND 
FRIENDS AS THINGS STAND I DON'T 
THINK FACEBOOK COULD SECURE THE 
CURRENT SYSTEM THEY WOULD HAVE TO 
REENGINEER IT AND RELEASE NEW 
VERSION FOR ALL THAT WOULD HAVE 
QUITE A BIG EFFECT ON CURRENT 
APPLICATIONS THERE ARE MULTIPLE 
APPLICATIONS EACH WOULD HAVE TO BE 
REENGINEERED AND POTENTIALLY IN 
ORDER TO SECURE THEM CORRECTLY THEY 
WOULD HAVE TO BRING THEM ALL 
INHOUSE TO FACEBOOK AND THEY WOULD 
ASSESS THE CODE AND PERHAPS SIGN 
THE CODE AND ENSURE THAT USERS' 
INFORMATION WAS KEPT CONFIDENTIAL 
WE ALSO OF COURSE PUT THESE 
CONCERNS TO FACEBOOK IT TOLD US 
THAT IT HAS 
IT ADVISES USERS TO EXERCISE 
CAUTION BUT OUR EXPERIMENT HAS 
SHOWN THAT THEIR STANDARD SECURITY 
SETTINGS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO 
PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION 
OR THAT OF YOUR FRIENDS NOW ALL 
THIS COMES IN THE MONTH THAT 
COMPETITOR MYSPACE OPENS UP ITS 
APPLICATION PLATFORM HOWEVER IT 
HANDLES THEM DIFFERENTLY HERE ALL 
APPLICATIONS RUN ON ITS OWN SERVES 
SO IT CAN SEE WHAT THEY'RE UP TO 
AND IT MANUALLY CHECKS ALL 
SUBMISSIONS AND RECHECKS THEM IF 
AUTHORS WISH TO CHANGE THE CODE WE 
WERE UNABLE TO CREATE A SIMILAR 
THREAT TO USER SECURITY USING THE 
MYSPACE SYSTEM IT CERTAINLY SEEMS 
THAT FACEBOOK'S STANDARD SECURITY 
SETTINGS ARE NOT ENOUGH TO PROTECT 
YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION OR THAT 
OF YOUR FRIENDS AND WE WOULD LOVE 
TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF ALL THIS 
SHORT VERSION OF CLICK THE LONGER 
VERSION IS COMING UP AND IT'S ALSO 
AVAILABLE TO STREAM FROM THE 
WEBSITE AND WE ARE ALSO AVAILABLE 
ON THE I PLAYER SO THERE IS 
NOWHERE TO HIDE NEXT WEEK WE TAKE 
A LOOK AT HOW TO BROADCAST TO THE 
WORLD FROM YOUR MOBILE PHONE SEE

CRACKING TOMORROW THOSE WERE THE 
WORDS OF BORIS JOHNSON 
HIS NEXT JOB IS TO APPOINT HIS 
STAFF LAST NIGHT SHORTLY AFTER 
MIDNIGHT THIS WAS HIS FIRST 
REACTION TO HIS VICTORY SPEECH 
THIS HAS BEEN MARATHON ELECTION 
AS YOU CAN TELL WITH RECORD 
TURNOUT AND I THINK IT HAS BEEN 
GOOD FOR POLITICS AND IT HAS BEEN 
GOOD FOR LONDON L. WANT TO THANK 
SHAN LYNSEY ALAN AND GERRARD WHO 
SOMETIMES JOINED US L. L. WANT TO 
THANK MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE BEEN 
TRUNDLING AROUND LONDON'S CHURCH 
HALLS AND TELEVISION STUDIOS 
DISPUTING THE MEANING OF 
MULTICULTURALISM AND THE EXACT COST 
OF CONDUCTORS ON WHICH POINT I 
THINK I AM GOING TO DECLARE VICTORY 
I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU BRIAN 
ON THE GREAT COMMON SENSE AND 
DECENCY WITH WHICH YOU PUT YOUR 
CASE AND I DO HOPE IT IS NOT THE 
END OF OUR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE 
POLICE AND AS FOR KEN I THINK YOU 
HAVE BEEN VERY CONSIDERABLE 
PUBLIC SERVANT AND A DISTINGUISHED 
LEADER OF THE CITY U. SHAPED THE 
OFFICE OF MAYOR YOU GAVE IT A 
NATIONAL PROMINENCE AND WHEN LONDON 
WAS ATTACKED ON SEVENTH JULY TWO THOUSAND FIVE WHO 
SPOKE FOR LONDON L. CAN TELL YOU 
YOUR COURAGE AND THE EXUBERANT 
NERVE WITH WHICH YOU STUCK IT TO 
YOUR ENEMIES ESPECIALLY IN NEW 
LABOUR YOU HAVE THEREBY EARNED THE 
THANKS AND NARRATIONS 
ADMIRATION OF THOUSANDS OF 
LONDONERS LONDONERS WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE KEN 
LIVINGSTONE ANDREW HAS WRITTEN A 
BIOGRAPHY ABOUT HIM L. KNOW YOU 
WERE DOWN AT CITY HALL LAST NIGHT 
BUT WHAT IS THE IMPRESSION YOU GOT 
FROM KEN LIVINGSTONE DEFLATED DEFLATED SHATTERED HE DID NOT EXPECT TO 
LOSE WHEN I SAW HIM LAST WEEK HE 
WAS EXPECTING TO WIN BY FOUR POINTS 
HE LOST BY SIX HE IS SIXTY THREE AND IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO SEE WHERE HE WILL GO 
POLITICALLY FROM THERE 
WAS HE 
DELUDED WHY DIDN'T ANYONE SEE THIS 
COMING IN HIS TEAM 
WHAT THEY WERE 
UNPREPARED FOR WAS THE PERFECT 
STORM THE NATIONAL SWING AWAY FROM 
LABOUR TWENTY POINTS SOME OF THE 
ADVISERS I SPOKE TO YESTERDAY NEVER 
EXPECTED ANYTHING LIKE THAT KEN 
LIVINGSTONE HAS ALWAYS BEEN MORE 
POPULAR THAN THE LABOUR PARTY THEY 
THOUGHT IF BORIS WAS AHEAD BY EIGHT 
OR TEN THEY COULD STILL WIN THE 
FACT IT WAS TWENTY WAS OVERWHELMING 
ALSO HAS THE REPORTS ABOUT WHAT HAS 
BEEN GOING ON AT CITY HALL BOTH OF 
THEM JOINED TOGETHER TO CREATE THE 
FEELING AMONGST MANY LONDONERS 
THAT THEY HAD HAD ENOUGH OF KENT 
LONDON HAS SAID NO THAT IS IT 
DO YOU THINK HE BOUGHT INTO THE 
FACT THAT BORIS MAY HAVE BEEN A 
JOKE AT THE START 
I WAS 
INTERVIEWING HIM EVEN BEFORE THE 
BORIS WAS ANNOUNCED AS A CANDIDATE 
KEN TREATED HIM SERIOUSLY THERE 
OTHER ADVISERS AROUND KEN 
LIVINGSTONE WHO THOUGHT NO ONE 
GOING TO VOTE FOR BORIS SURELY 
HE'S A BUFFOON AS THE WINTER CAME 
AND WENT AND WE WENT INTO SPRING 
THERE STARTED TO BE REAL FEAR AND 
CONCERN THAT ACTUALLY HE WAS BORIS 
AND KEN WAS KEN AND THERE WAS THAT 
NAME RECOGNITION THERE AND THEY 
WERE BOTH CELEBRITY AGAINST 
CELEBRITY AND FURTHERMORE GORDON 
BROWN WAS BECOMING INCREASINGLY 
UNPOPULAR SOMETHING WHICH KEN 
LIVINGSTONE WAS NOT SO CONCERNED 
ABOUT AND THAT IS WHAT HE TOLD ME 
BUT YOU ARE RIGHT NOT NECESSARILY 
KEN BUT SOME OF THE ADVISERS 
THOUGHT HE WAS A BIT OF A JOKE 
GIVE ME THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT HE 
WILL DO NOW 
IT'S BEEN HIS LIFE 
EVEN HIS PARTNER WORKED AS HIS 
OFFICE MANAGER SO BOTH OF THEM 
LOST THAT INCOME THEY LOST THEIR 
JOBS YOU ALWAYS GOT THE FEELING 
WITH BORIS IT WAS JUST ANOTHER 
JAPE IF HE DIDN'T GET TO BE MAYOR 
WITH KEN IT'S HIS LIFE SO I THINK 
HE'LL TAKE A BREAK HE WILL GET 
OVER WHAT IS CONSIDERABLE SHOCK 
FOR HIM AND HE'S GOING TO WRITE HIS 
MEMOIRS HE'S A VERY VERY GOOD 
SPEAKER I MANAGE THAT HE COULD 
EARN QUITE A BIT OF MONEY ON THE 
AFTER DINNER LECTURE CIRCUIT BUT 
IT'S NOT WHAT HE WANTS TO BE DOING 
HE WANTS TO BE AT THE CENTRE OF 
POLITICS AND EXERCISING POWER AND 
NOW THERE IS NO WAY HE'LL BE DOING 
EITHER 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE EITHER WILL BE TALKING TO THE HOME 
SECRETARY JACQUI SMITH ABOUT 
LABOUR'S DISAPPOINTING ELECTION 
RESULT AFTER EIGHT HUNDRED HERE ON BREAKFAST

WEEKEND'S BRITISH SOAP AWARDS LET'S LOOK AT THE THE WEATHER 
IT'S A WEEKEND WITH A BIT OF 
SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY THERE WILL

BAD BUT ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF RAIN 
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN AND THERE WILL 
BE SOME RAIN TODAY CHIEVLEY TO 
WESTERN PARTS OF THE U. K. FOR ALL OF 
US IT IS STARTING TO FEEL THAT BIT 
WARMER WE HAVE GOT HIGH PRESSURE 
OUT TO THE EAST BUT LOW PRESSURE 
IN THE WEST IT IS THAT THAT WILL 
BRING THE THE CLOUD AND RAIN TODAY 
YOU CAN SEE THE CLOUD HERE IT 
LOOKS FAIRLY EXTENSIVE BUT 
DOWNWIND THERE ARE SOME BREAKS IN 
IT A BIT OF CLOUD FOR SCOTLAND 
THIS MORNING PARTICULARLY TO THE 
WEST WHICH WILL PRODUCE SOME LIGHT 
RAIN AT TIMES SOME OF THAT COULD 
DRIFT A LITTLE FURTHER EAST 
GENERALLY IN THE EAST IT WILL BE 
DRY AND BRIGHT AND TEMPERATURES 
AROUND TEN TO TWELVE THROUGH THE VAST 
BULK OF ENGLAND IT SHOULD BE DRY 
CAN'T RULE OUT ONE OR TWO SPOTS OF 
RAIN THE CLOUD WILL COME AND GO 
THERE WILL BE BIG BREAKS ALLOWING 
THE SUN THROUGH LIFTING 
TEMPERATURES INTO THE MID TEENS 
ACROSS THE EAST EVEN FURTHER WEST 
W. MORE OF A SOUTH EASTERLY BREEZE 
IT SHOULD BE REASONABLY DRY JUST A 
FEW SPOTS OF RAIN FOR DEVON AND 
CORNWALL AND EVEN THAT CLOUD WILL 
THIN AND BREAK AS IT SHOULD DO 
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN ACROSS NORTHERN 
IRELAND GENERALLY CLOUDS WILL BE 
SKIES WILL BE CLOUDY IT WILL 
THICKEN IN THE THE AFTERNOON SO IT 
MAY TURN GREY IN THE WEST WITH A 
LITTLE MORE RAIN AROUND FURTHER 
EAST IT SHOULD STAY DRY AND IN THE 
BRIGHTER SKIES IF NOT SUNNY SKIES 
IT WILL FEEL QUITE WARM 
DURING THIS EVENING THE WIND WILL 
PICK UP IN THE WEST TOUCHING GALE 
FORCE AROUND THE IRISH SEA COAST 
THE RAIN WILL BE A TOUCH HERIER 
FOR ALL OF US A MILD NIGHT THE 
SOUTHERLY WINDS CONTINUE TO FEED IN 
THE MILD AIR A VERY MILD START TO 
TOMORROW ANOTHER MILD DAY THERE 
WILL BE A BIT MORE RAIN AROUND 
CERTAINLY WETTER ACROSS SCOTLAND 
AND RAIN INITIALLY ACROSS WALES AND 
SOUTH WEST EAST ANGLIA AND THE 
SOUTH EAST SHOULD BE DRY BRIGHT 
AND WARM TOWARDS THE WEST A MUCH 
BRIGHTER AND SUNNIER DAY ALL IN ALL 
THAT TEEM WILL CONTINUE FOO BANK 
HOLIDAY MONDAY HOLD ON TO SOME 
RAIN ACROSS THE EAST INTO 
THANK YOU IT'S TIME FOR A LOOK AT 
THE PAPERS IT'S NOT WE ARE GOING 
TO DO THAT IN A SECOND YOU ARE 
GETTING AHEAD OF YOURSELF FIRST 
STUDENTS MAY BE PAYING BACK TOO 
MUCH MONEY ON THEIR STUDENT LOANS 
BECAUSE THE LOANS SYSTEM IS FLAWED 
THAT IS ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL 
UNION OF STUDENTS OVER TWENTY FIVE MILLION 
HAVE TAKEN OUT LOANS WORTH OVER EIGHTEEN 
BILLION BUT BREAKFAST WE HAVE 
FOUND OUT THAT HAS FOUND OUT THAT 
THEY HAVE BEEN OVERCHARGED WHILE 
MANY WORRY ABOUT HOW THEY PAY BACK 
THEIR LOAN SOME LIKE KATY LANGHAM 
HAVE A DIFFERENT PROBLEM SHE HAS 
PAID BACK TOO MUCH NOW SHE IS 
TRYING TO GET A REFUND FROM THE 
STUDENT LOANS COMPANY 
I THINK THE 
WHOLE SYSTEM IS VERY FRUSTRATING 
FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME AND I THINK 
THAT THERE IS MOST PEOPLE OUT 
THERE I WOULD ASSUME DON'T KNOW 
THEY HAVE TO CALL THE STUDENT LOANS 
COMPANY TO TELL THEM THEY HAVE 
FINISHED PAYING THE LOAN L. THINK 
I'VE OVERPAID BY TWO THOUSAND I'VE ONLY 
RECEIVED ONE THOUSAND TO DATE AND I DENT 
KNOW WHEN I GET THAT IF THAT IS THE 
FULL AMOUNT THAT I'M DUE THE THE NATIONAL UNION OF STUDENTS SAYS 
THAT THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED 
MEANS ANY GRADUATE WHO HAS LOAN 
REPAYMENTS TAKEN FROM THEIR WAGES 
IS AT RISK OF PAYING BACK TOO MUCH 
IN THIS RESPECT THE SYSTEM IS 
FLAWED IT IS POSSIBLE FOR MY 
BORROWER TO OVERPAY ON THE AMOUNT 
OF LOAN DEBT THAT THEY HAVE SIMPLY 
BECAUSE THE COMPANY DOESN'T HAVE 
THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
REPAYMENTS FROM THE END OF ONE TAX 
YEAR TO THE NEXT 
THE SYSTEM WAS 
CHANGED TEN YEARS AGO SO THAT WHEN 
A STUDENTS LEAVE UNIVERSITY AND 
STARTS WORKING FOR AN EMPLOYER 
MONEY THEY OWE ON THEIR LOAN CAN BE 
TAKEN FROM THEIR WAGE PACKET THE 
PROBLEM IS THEY ARE ONLY SENT A 
STATEMENT SAYING HOW MUCH THEY OWE 
ONCE A YEAR BY THE TIME THEY GET 
THE STATEMENT THE INFORMATION IS 
MONTHS OUT OF DATE THAT MAKES IT 
DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO 
CHECK HOW MUCH THEY OWE BECAUSE BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WORKS OUT WHETHER YOU 
OWE MONEY OR NOT IT DOES MEAN THAT 
YOU COULD JUST OWE ONE AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THE TAX YEAR AND THEN 
IT WILL CARRY ON TAKING MONEY 
RELATIVE TO YOUR INCOME SO IT 
MIGHT CARRY ON TAKING TENS TWENTIES 
HUNDREDS OF POUNDS EVEN FROM YOUR 
PAY PACKET 
THE GOVERNMENT DENIES 
THE SYSTEM IS FLAWED BUT IS 
INTRODUCING IMPROVEMENTS FROM 
SEPTEMBER 
I'VE INSTRUCTED THE SEPTEMBER STUDENT LOANS COMPANY TO MAKE 
FURTHER REFORMS AND AS FROM NEXT 
YEAR STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO 
PREDICT WHEN THEIR REPAYMENTS ARE 
DUE TO CEASE AND STEP OUT OF THE 
AUTOMATIC SYSTEM AND REPAY MANUALLY 
AND THAT WILL MEAN THAT NO ONE 
SHOULD REPAY MORE THAN THEY ARE DUE 
TO 
THE CHANGES SHOULD MEAN FAR TO FEWER GRADUATES OVERPAY ON THEIR 
LOANS BUT THE ONUS WILL STILL BE 
ON THE BORROWER TO MONITOR THEIR 
ACCOUNT AS THE NEW SYSTEM WON'T 
AUTOMATICALLY STOP TAKING PAYMENTS 
ONCE THE LOAN'S BEEN PAID IN FULL 
WE'LL FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THAT 
LATER WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO A 
FINANCIAL EXPERT JUST AFTER NINE HUNDRED 
THIS MORNING LET US KNOW IF YOU 
HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WE HAVE ALREADY 
HAD ONE E. MAIL FROM SOMEONE WHO 
SAYS THEY'VE PAID TWO THOUSAND TOWARDS A 
STUDENT LOAN BUT THE MONEY HAS 
ENDED UP WITH THE THE TAX MAN 
CAUSING PEOPLE A LOT OF PROBLEMS 
AS PROMISED AS WIDELY ADVERTISED 
IT IS TIME TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS 
ANDREW PEARCE JOINS US FROM THE 
TELEGRAPH AND WE ARE ALSO JOINED BY 
MARK PERRY FROM DEAD RINGERS OR 
SHOULD I SAY KEN OR BORIS NUMBER TWO 
EITHER WILL DO OR ONE ACCORDING 
TO THE ELECTORATE LET'S LOOK AT 
SOME OF THE FRONT PAGES THIS 
MORNING THERE WE ARE THE PICTURE 
FROM THE TIMES BORIS CLEARLY NOT 
THIS MORNING BUT THAT WAS HIM 
YESTERDAY HAVING A BIT OF A LIMB 
BER UP OUTSIDE BROWN BLOODIED IN 
MAY DAY MASSACRE 
THEER IS THE DAILY TELEGRAPH 
HERE AND THE DAILY MAIL SAYING 
BORIS HAS THE LAST LAUGH MAKING 
THE POINT THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT HE 
WAS A JOKER AND NOW HE HAS THE JOB 
THE INDEPENDENT ONE WORD CRIPES 
AND THE DAILY EXPRESS PROBABLY 
TAKING THE HARSHEST LINE OF ALL 
THEY ARE SAYING THAT GORDON BROWN 
IS ALL BUT FINISHED AFTER THE THE 
POLLS THE SUN IS TALKING ABOUT 
HAIR OF LONDON REFERRING TO HIS 
MOP OF GOLD HAIR IT HAS GOT 
SHORTER HE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IT IT IS LESS WAYWARD 
IT'S THE CYCLE 
HELMET 
ANDREW YOU STARTED US ON HELMET THE GUARDIAN 
BECAUSE THE HEADLINES 
ARE OBVIOUS YOU TRY TO FIND THE 
IT'S THE ONE PAPER WOULD THINK 
MIGHT GIVE SOME SUCK YOU ARE TO 
GORDON BROWN BUT THE COLUMNIST 
HERE IS DEVASTATING HE SAYS M. P.'S 
SHOULD INVOKE THE SPIRIT AND SAY IN 
GOD'S NAME GO BUT HE PREDICTS THEY 
WON'T DO IT AND GRIND RELENTLESSLY 
AND HIS PREDICTION IS IF THEY DO 
THAT THE PARTY WILL BE LED 
INEVITABLY TO DEFEAT AT THE GENERAL 
ELECTION FACED WITH THE CHOICE 
BETWEEN HUNGER FOR POWER AND 
FATALISM LABOUR OPTS FOR THE LATTER 
THE TROUBLE IS THE PROCESS FOR 
GETTING RID OF A LABOUR LEADER IS 
CUMBERSOME TWENTY PER CENT OF M. P.'S SEVENTY THEN A 
SPECIAL MOTION AT A SPECIAL 
CONFERENCE SO THEY WILL PROBABLY 
PERSEVERE WITH HIM UNLESS IT GETS 
MUCH WORSE AND THEN GOU TO MATTHEW 
PARRIS IN THE TIMES HE IS INVOKING 
HE IS OVERJOYED THEY WAS A GREAT 
SUPPORTER OF JOHN MAJOR HE IS 
RATHER ENJOYING LABOUR'S DISCOMFORT 
AND HIS ADVICE IS THE SAME THEY 
SIMPLY HAVE TO GIVE UP ON GORDON 
BROWN AND HE GOES THROUGH ALL THE 
THINGS THEY WILL SAY SHARPEN THE 
ARGUMENT THAT IS HOW WE GET BETTER 
SENSE OF PURPOSE SIMPLER MESSAGES 
FILL THE PAIN FEEL THE PAIN OF 
THE VOTERS ALL THE OLD CLICHES 
THAT WE WILL HEAR AS THE M. P.'S 
BOMBARD THE AIRWAVES BUT HE IS 
MAKING THE POINT FORGET ALL THAT 
STUFF BECAUSE IT IS OVER BROWN IS 
DOOMED HE IS FINISHED HE HAS TO 
GO MATTHEW PARRIS STKWANT HIM TO 
GO BECAUSE HE THINKS THAT HE IS 
THE BEST THING THAT THE TORIES HAVE 
DOESN'T WANT HIM TO GO 
MARK YOU 
HAVE BEEN WATCHING KEN AND BORIS 
FOR QUITE SOME TIME IN THEIR OWN 
WORDS LET'S ASK YOU WHY DID KEN 
LOSE AND BORIS WIN 
POOR KEN HE IS 
PROBABLY WAKING UP THIS MORNING AND 
THINK I'M GOBSMACKED WHEN IT COMES 
TO THE LADY VOTERS DON'T FORGET IT

MY NASAL DRONE HAS BEEN DUBBED ON 
TO EVERY VIBRATOR IN THE CAPITAL 
YOU HAVE THE UNIQUE KEN SOUND AT 
THE CLICK OF A SWITCH ALL BORIS 
CAN IMPERSONATE WAS THE SOUND OF A 
C. D. STUCK ON PLAY I I I I I 
DISAGREE 
BORIS HAS A HABIT OF DISAGREE DISARMING PEOPLE WITH RESPONSES TO 
PEOPLE AND OFTEN HE COMES OUT WITH 
SOMETHING COMPLETELY AT ODDS WITH 
WHAT THEY HAVE ASKED 
I'M ALL OVER 
THE PLACE A BIT LIKE MY FACE MY 
FAVOURITE RESPONSE IN THE WHOLE OF 
THE LAST FOUR WEEKS OF THE ELECTION 
WAS WHEN HE WAS ACTUALLY ASKED 
BORIS HAVE YOU EVER SLEPT WITH A 
MAN IAN HISLOP POINTED THIS OUT 
ON CAMERA AND HE SAYS 
DID YOU SAY 
YOU ASKED THE QUESTION HE BLUS TERD AND HE SAID HAVE YOU AND HE 
SAID I I NOT YET THAT FUDGE NON 
ANSWER SHOULD WIN IT JUST FOR THAT 
POLITICAL ANSWER ALONE BORIS BORIS JOHNSON IS A GIFT BECAUSE SHE IS

CALCULATING PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN 
AND THE THE CAMPAIGN WAS RUN 
BRILLIANTLY BY A MAN CAUSE LYNTON

SPORTING PERFECTION 
PERHAPS WHEN ROGER FEDERER PLAYS AT 
THE TOP OF HIS GAME TIGER WOODS 
AND LAST NIGHT FROM RONNIE 
O'SULLIVAN OUTSTANDING EVEN IF 
YOU DON'T LIKE SNOOKER YOU HAVE TO 
SEE THIS IT IS NOT OFTEN THE MOST 
SUCCESSFUL SNOOKER PLAYER THE WORLD 
HAS EVER SEEN IS HUMILIATED BUT 
STEPHEN HENDRY WAS KNOCKED OUT OF 
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP BY WHAT HE 
SAID WHAT SNOOKER PERFECTION 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN LEFT THE CROWD 
OPEN MOUTHED AT TIMES AND 
AFTERWARDS HENDRY DESCRIBED HIM AS 
THE BEST HE HAS AT THE PLAYED 
AGAINST WITH A BREAK OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN HE WON 
HIS FOURTH FRAME IN A ROW THERE WAS A 
HINT OF FIGHTBACK WHEN HE WON 
THE NEXT TWO FRAMES BUT EVERYTHING 
HE TOUCHED WENT IN EVEN IF IT 
WASN'T THE POCKET HE WAS INTENDING 
IT WAS A MATTER OF TIME AFTER THIS 
O'SULLIVAN COMPLETED HIS WIN SEVENTEEN TO SIX 
A VIRTUAL REPEAT OF THE RESULT WHEN 
THEY MET IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
THERE ARE AREAS I 
NEED TO IMPROVE ON AT A SESSION 
LIKE THIS MORNING AND TONIGHT 
BILLS CONFIDENCE AND YOU START TO 
GET COMFORTABLE BUILDS 
CONFIDENCE I CANNOT BE TOO HARD ON 
MYSELF BUT I AM ALWAYS STRIVING TO 
HIT THE HEIGHTS I KNOW I AM CAPABLE 
OF I DON'T THINK THAT IS A BAD 
THING 
I WAS AS COMPREHENSIVELY THING OUTPLAYED AS I HAVE EVER BEEN IN MY 
CAREER I CANNOT REMEMBER RONNIE 
MISSING A BALL THIS AFTERNOON 
GETTING OUT OF POSITION IT WAS 
OUTSTANDING SNOOKER AND HIS SAFETY 
PLAY WAS UNBELIEVABLE THE ONLY 
TIME I WAS COMING TO THE TABLE WAS 
TO EITHER BREAK OFF FOR PLAY FROM 
AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION YOU HAVE 
TO LOOK BACK AND ADMIRE IT BECAUSE 
IT WAS PERFECT SNOOKER 
IT IS STARTING TO LOOK AS IF THE 
NEXT PLAYER TO BE DAZZLED WILL BE 
ALI CARTER HE HAS THE EDGE IN HIS 
SEMI AGAINST JOE PERRY HE STARTED 
THE SESSION FIVE TO THREE DOWN BUT WHEN TO 
LEAD SEVEN TO FIVE JOE PERRY PLAYED SUPERB 
SHOTS TO TRIM THE LEAD TO EIGHTY SEVEN 
BEFORE ALI CARTER RESTORED HIS 
ADVANTAGE CLEARING UP WITH A BREAK 
OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT TO FINISH NINE TO SEVEN THAT COVERAGE 
IS ON B. B. C. TWO THIS AFTERNOON 
FOOTBALL ON A DAY OF RECKONING IN 
THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE WE COULD SEE 
BOURNEMOUTH PULL OFF THE GREATEST 
OF ESCAPES IN THE ONE AT THE TOP 
NOTTINGHAM FOREST ARE BATTLING WITH 
DONCASTER AND CARLISLE FOR 
AUTOMATIC PROMOTION IN THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE FULHAM NEED TO BEAT 
MANCHESTER UNITED NEED TO BEAT WEST 
HAM TO KEEP THE TITLE IN THEIR OWN 
HANDS HANDS THE GAME AT CRAVEN COTTAGE BETWEEN 
BIRMINGHAM AND FULHAM IS LIKE A CUP 
FINAL FULHAM LOOKED DOWN AND OUT 
LAST WEEK BUT THEN THEY PROVE THEY 
HAVE THE FIGHT TO SURVIVE 
HE IS LOOKING VERY DISAPPOINTED 
AT FOUR P. M. LAST SATURDAY HE LOOKED 
BROKEN MAN HIS TEAM WERE TWO TO ZERO DOWN 
AND HEADING FOR RELEGATION THAT 
WAS UNTIL PERHAPS THE COMEBACK OF 
THE SEASON 
HE HAS SCORED WONDERFUL 
WONDERFUL GOAL AND THEY ARE GOING 
TO TAKE ALL THREE POINTS THE GREAT 
ESCAPE FOR FALLEN IS DEFINITELY ON 
IT WAS IMPORTANT AT THE WEEKEND TO 
GET THAT VICTORY AND TO GIVE 
OURSELVES A CHANCE IT IS A SMALL 
CHANCE IT IS A VERY VERY 
DIFFICULT JOB BECAUSE WE ARE THREE 
POINTS BEHIND OUR RIVALS WITH ONLY 
TWO MATCHES 
AT LEAST THEY ARE 
STILL IN IT AHEAD OF WHAT IS SAID 
TO BE A PIVOTAL MATCH PHRASES LIKE 
MUST WIN GAMES AND RELEGATION SIX 
POINTER AS ARE SOMETIMES OVER USED 
IN FOOTBALL BUT NOT AT CRAVEN 
COTTAGE BY THE END OF TODAY 
EITHER FALLEN OR BIRMINGHAM COULD 
BE DOWN ALEX MCLEISH'S SIDE LET 
SLIP A TWO GOAL LEAD TO LIVERPOOL 
AND SOME FANS ARE FEARING THE WORST 
FALLEN AWAY AND BLACKBURN AT HOME 
AND NOT THE EASIEST GAMES BUT LOOK 
AT THE OTHER TEAMS IN TROUBLE THEY 
HAVE EQUALLY GOT TOUGH GAMES IT IS 
DOWN TO BIRMINGHAM I AM SURE IF 
THEY PLAY TO THEIR POTENTIAL THEY 
CAN DO IT L. AM NOT CONVINCED IF IF THE MANAGERS WILL BE HOLDING THEIR 
BREATH SO WILL THE FANS A MATCH 
TO TEST THE TOUGHEST FINGERNAILS IS 
ABOUT THE ONLY GUARANTEE 
CELTIC CAN STRETCH THEIR LEAD OVER 
RANGERS AT THE TOP OF THE S. P. L. BY 
EIGHT POINTS RANGERS PLAY TOMORROW 
AND WOULD HAVE FOUR GAMES IN HAND 
BUT LAST WEEK'S VICTORY OVER 
RANGERS HAS REIGNITED CELTIC'S 
HOPES OF TAKING THE TITLE 
MOTHERWELL HAVE TO HOLD ON TO THIRD 
SPOT BUT GORDON STRACHAN IS NOT 
EXPECTING A BEAUTIFUL GAME 
IT IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO QUIT 
FOOTBALL FOR BOTH SIDES SAYING 
THAT THE LAST TIME WE PLAYED THERE 
I LOOKED AT THE GAME AND WE 
ACTUALLY PLAYED HALF DECENT STUFF 
AT TIMES ON THE SURFACE THAT ISN'T 
CONDUCIVE TO GOOD FOOTBALL WE WILL 
TRY TO PLAY GOOD FOOTBALL TOMORROW 
IF NOT WE TRY TO CREATE AS MANY 
CHANCES AS WE CAN THROUGH OTHER 
WAYS WAYS RUGBY UNION CARDIFF BLUES KEPT

BORIS JOHNSON HAS WON THE RACE TO 
BECOME THE NEXT MAYOR OF LONDON 
ENDING KEN LIVINGSTONE'S EIGHT YEAR 
REIGN AT CITY HALL THERE WILL BE A 
CHURCH SERVICE IN PORTUGAL AND IN 
LEICESTERSHIRE TODAY TO MARK THE 
FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
DISAPPEARANCE OF MADELEINE MCCANN 
NOW THE WEATHER LIGHT AND PATCHY 
IN SCOTLAND MOST PLACES WILL BE 
DRY THE ODD SPLASH GETTING FURTHER 
EAST TO THE EAST IT WILL THIN AND 
BREAK AND WE SHOULD SEE THE SUN 
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CASE ACROSS 
MUCH OF ENGLAND THROUGH THE MORNING 
THERE IS LARGE AMOUNTS OF CLOUD 
PUSHING NORTHWARDS ON THE SOUTH 
EASTERLY FLOW BUT IT WILL THIN AND 
BREAK AND ONCE THE SUN IS OUT IT 
WILL FEEL PLEASANTLY WARM THIRTEEN 
DEGREES IN THE WEST GREATER CHANCE 
OF A FEW SPLASHES OF RAIN MOST 
WILL BE DRY WHILE IT HAS BEEN WET 
SO FAR ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND DRY 
AND BRIGHTER WEATHER ALWAYS THE 
CHANCE OF RAIN THROUGH THE DAY TO 
THE WEST THE BRIGHTER SKIES IN THE 
EAST AND WARM AT NINETEEN IT WILL REMAIN 
WARM THROW THE WEEKEND THROUGH 
NOW IT'S TIME FOR NEWSWATCH AND 
COMPLAINTS BY TEACHERS OVER THE 
COVERAGE OF THEIR STRIKE LAST WEEK 
AND THAT IT PAINTED THEM IN POOR LIGHT 
WELCOME THIS WEEK WERE STRIKING 
TEACHERS TREATED UNFAIRLY BY B. B. C. 
NEWS AND IT'S ONLY GAME SO WHY 
HAS GRAND THEFT AUTO GETTING SO 
MUCH AIR TIME LAST THURSDAY 
THOUSANDS OF SCHOOLS ACROSS ENGLAND 
AND WALES WERE AFFECTED BY A ONE 
DAY STRIKE BY MEMBERS OF THE 
NATIONAL NATIONAL IT WAS THE MAIN 
STORY ON B. B. C. NEWS FOR MOST OF THE 
DAY BUT SOME WERE UNHAPPY AS HOW 
THE STRIKE WERE PRESENTED AS A 
NUMBER WERE CONCERNED THAT SALARY 
FIGURES YOUR UNFAIR TO TEACHERS WE 
WENT TO SHROPSHIRE TO HEAR THE 
COMMENTS OF ONE VUER 
I'M SUSAN 
BANKS AND A RETIRED PRIMARY SCHOOL 
TEACHER I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE 
WITH THE STRIKE BUT I WAS VERY 
UPSET AT THE WAY THE B. B. C. REPORTED 
ON IT 
LATEST FIGURES SHOW TEACHERS 
EARN AN AVERAGE OF THIRTY THREE THOUSAND 
THAT IS 
TOTALLY WRONG BECAUSE THAT 
INCLUDES A HEADTEACHER'S SALARY AND 
THAT BRINGS THE AVERAGE UP YOUNG 
TEACHERS GOING INTO THE PROFESSION 
EARN TWENTY THOUSAND A YEAR TO MAKE 
MATTERS WORSE THE B. B. C. COMPARED US 
WITH THE SALARIES OF NURSES AND 
POLICE OFFICERS MUST AS WE RESPECT 
THE JOBS THEY DO NOT HAVE TO DO A 
FOUR YEAR DEGREE COURSE WHEN A 
GRADUATE BECOMES A TEACHER THE 
FELLOW GRADUATES ARE EARNING 
CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN THEY WILL BE 
JUST A QUICK ONE ON THE TEACHERS 
BECAUSE WE ARE HAVING SO MANY 
PEOPLE WHO ARE STRIKING TODAY 
SAYING THAT THE FIGURES WE ARE 
QUOTING OF THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND THEY DON'T GET 
EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE TEN YEARS' 
EXPERIENCE THEY ARE SAYING THAT IS 
NOT A TEAR 
EVEN WHEN PEOPLE TOLD 
THE B. B. C. THAT THE FIGURE OF THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND 
WAS MISLEADING IT WAS STILL 
REPEATED BY A GOVERNMENT MINISTER 
WITHOUT ANY CHALLENGE 
I THINK 
PARENTS ARE BEWILDERERD BECAUSE 
THEY HEAR THAT THE AVERAGE TEACHER 
EARNS ABOUT THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND 
ON THURSDAY 
EVENING I WATCHED THE B. B. C. SIX 
O'CLOCK NEWS L. WAS AMAZED AT HOW 
THE THE FOCUS WAS ENTIRELY HOW THE 
STRIKE HAD AFFECTED OTHER PEOPLE 
SCHOOLS CAN BE CLOSED FOR MANY 
REASONS SUCH AS LOCAL ELECTIONS 
THIS WEEK THE B. B. C. WON'T BE DOING 
THE SOB STORY ABOUT THAT WE ALSO 
HAVE SINGLE MUMS WHO ARE TEACHERS 
AND FINALLY THIS IS HOW THE WHOLE 
THIS IS THE HOW THE WHOLE REASON 
FOR THE STRIKE WAS SUMMED UP SO SO WHAT DOES AN AVERAGE TEACHER GET 
I WAS EARNING THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND AT THE END OF 
A LONG TEACHING CAREER AFTER MANY 
YEARS AND AS FOR THE ONE ABOUT THE 
HOLIDAYS EVERY TEACHER I KNOW 
WORKS FOR LOT OF THE HOLIDAYS 
WATCHED THE COVERAGE ON MY LOCAL 
B. B. C. MIDLANDS TODAY AND WAS MUCH 
MORE IMPRESSED WITH THE FAIRNESS 
THEY INTERVIEWED PARENTS BUT ALSO 
INTERVIEWED TEACHERS A YOUNG 
TEACHER AND AN OLDER TEACHER IT 
CAME OUT ABOUT THE YOUNGER 
TEACHER'S FINANCIAL STRUGGLE 
DON'T EXPECT B. B. C. TO SUPPORT THE 
STRIKE BUT I DO EXPECT ACCURACY 
AND FAIRNESS 
LET'S DEAL WITH THE 
FIGURES FIRST VIEWERS HAVE 
COMPLAINED THAT GIVING THE AVERAGE 
FIGURE OF THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND WAS MISLEADINGLY 
HIGH BECAUSE IT INCLUDED THE 
SALARIES OF HEADTEACHERS IS THAT A 
FAIR POINT 
THIS FIGURE WE GOT 
FROM THE DEPARTMENT FOR CHILDREN 
SCHOOLS AND FAMILIES AND LIKE 
EVERYTHING ELSE WE PUT FIGURES ON 
AIR IN GOOD FAITH AND TRY TO CHECK 
THEM OUT WITH THE SOURCES THAT WE 
REGARD AS MOST RELIABLE AND 
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS DO TEND TO 
GIVE FAIR FIGURES OUR RESPONSE 
WHEN WE GET QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 
FAIGS THAT WE ARE USING IS TO CHECK 
OUT WHERE ARE THESE CONCERNS COMING 
FROM AND IN THAT CASE FIGURES 
YOU COULD CERTAINLY ARGUE THAT THE 
FIGURE WAS MISLEADING IN ONE SENSE 
IT WAS COMPLETELY ACCURATE IT 
REFLECTED THE OVERALL SALARIES OF 
TEACHERS INCLUDING SPECIALIST 
TEACHERS AND INCLUDING HEADTEACHERS 
AND LET'S NOTE FOR GET THAT THE NUT 
MEMBERSHIP INCLUDES A NUMBER OF 
HEADTEACHERS YOU COULD WELL ARGUE 
THAT THEY WERE REPRESENTED IN THE 
FIGURE I THINK MANY PEOPLE 
WATCHING WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE 
MEANT A CLASSROOM TEACHER AND WHEN 
WE WENT BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT AND 
ASKED SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE SALARY 
WOULD BE FOR A CLASSROOM TEACHER 
THEY CAME UP WITH A FIGURE WHICH 
WAS THIRTY TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SO CERTAINLY LOWER 
THAN THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND YET NOT MASSIVELY 
LOWER WE THEREFORE TOOK THAT INTO 
ACCOUNT IN THE THE LATER COVERAGE 
OUR SIX O'CLOCK NEWS GAVE A MUCH 
BROADER RANGE AFTER SIX YEARS 
WHICH WE 
WERE CONFIDENT WITH THERE THERE WERE CONCERNS VIEWERS ASKED WHY WERE TEACHERS' SALARIES COMPARED 
WITH NURSES AND POLICE OFFICERS A 
VIEWER SAID THAT WAS MISLEADING 
THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO 
CAT GORISE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF 
PEOPLE AND YOU NEVER ARRIVE AT THE 
PERFECT ALTERNATIVE CERTAINLY 
THERE ARE STRONG FEELINGS OF 
RESPECT OUT THRT IN THE COMMUNITY 
FOR TEACHERS WHO WOULD RESPECT 
THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND CHOSE TO 
LUMP THEM WITH GROUPS LIKE LAWYERS 
AND DOCTORS AS YOU SUGGEST BUT IN 
REPORTING AN INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE THE 
IMPORTANT BENCH MARK IS PUBLIC 
SECTOR PAY AND THE BODIES THAT THEY 
ARE MORE ROUTINELY COMPARED WITH IN 
PAY AWARDS AND THAT WOULD TAKE THEM 
INTO A GROUP WHERE WE WERE LOOKING 
WITH POLICE OFFICERS AND NURSING 
STAFF 
SUSAN BANKS IN THE FILM AND STAFF OTHERS HAVE ASKED WAS THERE TOO 
MUCH FOCUS ON THE IMPACT ON PARENTS 
AND BUSINESSES RATHER ON THE CAUSE 
AND MARY SCOTT TOLD US AN ELEMENT OF TRUTH THERE 
FIRSTLY IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT AND 
IT'S PART OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY IN 
ADDRESSING OUR AUDIENCE AND IN 
REPORTING THE WORLD AROUND US TO 
REPORT THE IMPACT OF AN INDUSTRIAL 
DISPUTE AS FULLY AS WE CAN WE NEED 
TO REPORT A DISPUTE ITSELF AND WE 
DID THAT BOTH ON THE DAY AND THE 
DAY BEFORE WE LOOKED AT THE 
REASONS AND CAUSES FOR THE DISPUTE 
AND HEARD FROM THE UNIONS AND 
INDIVIDUAL TEACHERS AND WE 
ADDRESSED ALL OF THOSE ARGUMENTS IN 
DETAIL BUT NOT TO REPORT THE 
IMPACT WOULD BE A DERELICTION OF 
DUTY AND I THINK YOU ONLY NEED TO 
LOOK AT DISPUTES LIKE THE 
GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY FEW DAYS AGO 
WHERE THE IMPACT OF THE DISPUTE IS 
VERY MUCH PART OF IT IT IS 
CONSIDERED BY THE PARTICIPATES IN 
ANY INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE ON BOTH 
SIDES THEY WEIGH IT UP AND AUR 
AUDIENCE NEEDS TO WEIGH IT UP TOO 
OUR 
THANK YOU THE B. B. C. SEEMS FOND OUR OF PROMOTING THE LATEST CINEMA 
RELEASES AND T. V. SHOWS ON THE NEWS 
BUT WOULD YOU EXPECT A VIOLENT EIGHTEEN 
CERTIFICATE FILM WITH NO STAR NAMES 
TO GET COVERED WHY HAS THIS BEEN A 
STORY THIS WEEK 
THE WAIT WILL BE 
OVER WHEN GRAND THEFT AUTO THE FOURTH GOES 
ON SALE AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT THAT'S 
IF YOU CAN GET ONE 
NONE OF YOU 
MOVE 
GET ON THE FLOOR 
IT'S A MOVE VIOLENT VIDEO GAME SET IN THE MEAN 
STREETS OF A FISSIONAL CITY TO THE 
FANS IT IS WORTH MORE THAN 
HOLLYWOOD BLOCKBUSTER TO THE 
CRITICS IT'S AN ADULT GAME THAT IS 
BOUND TO GET INTO THE HANDS OF 
CHILDREN AND CAUSE THEM HARM A 
NUMBER OF YOU WROTE IN AND THIS ONE 
RORY DID YOU HAVE ANY WORRIES 
ABOUT DOING THAT REPORT AND 
PRESENTING THOSE VIOLENT IMAGES WE WE DID WE THINK VERY DEEPLY ABOUT 
COVERING THE LAUNCH OF ANY NEW 
PRODUCT AND WE REALLY SET OURSELVES 
A TEST WHICH IS DOES THIS ACTUALLY 
SAY ANYTHING NEW ABOUT THE INDUSTRY 
IT COMES FROM AND ABOUT THE WAY 
OUR LIVES ARE CHANGING WE DECIDED 
THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THIS 
PRODUCT PASSED THAT TEST IT CAME 
OUT JUST A MONTH AFTER A MAJOR 
REVIEW BY THE GOVERNMENT INTO THE 
IMPACT OF VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES ON 
CHILDREN IT IS ALSO POSSIBLY A 
LANDMARK IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
WHOLE VIDEO GAMES INDUSTRY IT IS 
NOW RIVALING HOLLYWOOD WE COVER 
THAT AND THE MUSIC INDUSTRY AND THE 
NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY AND WE FELT WE 
SHOULD COVER THE VIDEO GAMES 
INDUSTRY TOO AND THIS WAS QUITE A 
GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT IT 
HERE YOU WERE GIVING A LOT OF 
PUBLICITY TO AN EIGHTEEN CERTIFICATE 
VIDEO GAME WHICH WAS DESCRIBED AS 
ONE OF THE MOST VIOLENT EVER MADE 
AND YOU WERE DOING IT AT BREAKFAST 
TIME AND ON THE SIX O'CLOCK NEWS 
ISN'T THERE A TIMING ISSUE HERE 
ONCE AGAIN WE LOOKED VERY CAREFULLY 
AT THE IMAGES THAT WE USED WE 
TRIED TO MAKE SURE THAT NOTHING TOO 
VIOLENT WAS USED WHILE GIVING SOME 
FEEL OF THE THE CONTENT OF THE GAME 
I THINK WE WERE PRETTY CAUTIOUS 
ABOUT THAT WE NEEDED TO SHOW THE 
LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION THAT GOES 
INTO MAKING THESE PRODUCTS AND JUST 
GIVE A CLUE AS TO THAT WE WERE 
ABOUT I DON'T THINK WE USED 
ANYTHING THAT WAS EXCESSIVELY 
VIOLENT IN TERMS OF THE AUDIENCES 
WE WERE ADDRESSING 
SOMETHING THERE 
SOMETHING RATHER WORRYING THAT YOU 
ARE DISCUSSING THE EFFECTS ON 
SOCIETY OF VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES AND 
THEN AT THE SAME TIME ALMOST BY 
DEFAULT PROMOTING THAT VERY THING 
I THINK WE WERE DOING MORE THAN 
THAT WE WERE ALSO TALKING ABOUT AN 
INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED INDUSTRY 
WHICH HAS A GROWING AUDIENCE AND 
ALSO IT MUST BE STRESSED HERE A 
MORE AND MORE ADULT AUDIENCE THE 
AVERAGE AGE OF VIDEO GAMES PLAYERS 
IS NOW TWENTY FIVE THEY HAVE CHOICE 
WHETHER OR NOT TO BUY AN EIGHTEEN 
CERTIFICATE GAME WHICH THIS WAS L. 
THINK LOT OF THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN 
INTERESTED IN THE TELLING OF THIS 
STORY PARTICULARLY AS IT'S 
BRITISH SUCCESS STORY IN SOME WAYS 
IN THAT IT COMES FROM SMALL 
BUSINESS WHICH WAS STARTED IN 
DUNDEE MORE THAN A DECADE AGO WE 
TRACED THAT AS WELL 
WE ALSO HAD THE LAUNCH OF A NEW 
PRODUCT FROM NINTENDO LAST WEEK 
WHICH WAS DEMONSTRATED LIVE ON B. B. C. 
NEWS NEWS IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU HAVE 
PLAYED GAMES ALL YOUR LIFE OR 
WHETHER YOU HAVE NEVER PICKED ONE 
UP BEFORE IN THE WAY THAT WE MAKE 
PEOPLE START TRAINING THEIR BRAINS 
WITH BRAIN TRAINING ON THE NINTENDO 
D. S. WITH THIS ONE WE'RE GOING TO 
BE GETTING PEOPLE FIT 
SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE 
WATCHING A SHOPPING CHANNEL RATHER 
THAN A NEWS PROGRAMME THANK YOU 
FOR ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS PLEASE 
CONTACT US 
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING YOU COULD 
BE MAKING OUR NEWS NEXT WEEK

WHICH CURRENTLY PREVENT THE THREE 
SUSPECTS FROM SEEING THE POLICE 
FILES BUT FOR TODAY THE FOCUS IS

SOME OF HIS BEST MOMENTS A LITTLE 
BIT LATER ON 
LET'S GET CRACKING TOMORROW LET'S 
HAVE A DRINK THOSE WERE THE WORDS 
CHOSEN BY BORIS JOHNSON TO 
CELEBRATE HIS VICTORY HIS NEXT JOB 
IS TO START PLANNING HIS 
ADMINISTRATION AND TO APPOINT HIS 
STAFF LAST NIGHT THIS WAS BORIS'S 
FIRST REACTION IN HIS VICTORY 
SPEECH THIS HAS BEEN A MARATHON 
ELECTION AS YOU CAN TELL WITH A 
RECORD TURNOUT AND I THINK IT'S 
BEEN GOOD FOR POLITICS AND IT'S 
BEEN GOOD FOR LONDON 
AND I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY 
ESPECIALLY MY TWO COLLEAGUES IN THE 
STRANGE TRIUMVIRATE WHO HAVE BEEN 
TRUNDLING AROUND LONDON'S CHURCH 
HALLS AND T. V. STUDIOS VIOLENTLY 
DISPUTING THE MEANING OF 
MULTICULTURALISM AND THE EXACT 
COST OF CONDUCTORS ON WHICH POINT 
I THINK I AM GOING TO DECLARE 
VICTORY AND I WANT TO CONGRATULATE 
YOU BRIAN ON YOUR GREAT 
COMMONSENSE AND DECENCY WITH WHICH 
YOU PUT YOUR CASE AND I DO HOPE 
THAT THIS IS NOT THE END OF OUR 
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE POLICE AND 
AS FOR KEN MAYOR LIVINGSTONE I 
THINK YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY 
CONSIDERABLE PUBLIC SERVANT AND 
THE DISTINGUISHED LEADER OF THIS 
CITY U. SHAPED THE OFFICE OF MAYOR 
YOU GAVE IT NATIONAL PROMINENCE 
AND WHEN LONDON WAS ATTACKED ON SEVENTH 
JULY TWO THOUSAND FIVE WHO SPOKE FOR LONDON 
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT YOUR 
COURAGE AND THE SHEER EXUBERANT 
NERVE WITH WHICH YOU STUCK IT TO 
YOUR ENEMIES ESPECIALLY NEW 
LABOUR SLASH OU HAVE THEREBY EARNED 
THE THANKS AND ADMIRATION OF 
MILLIONS OF LONDONERS THE HOME 
SECRETARY JACK IS MADE IS IN OUR 
STUDIO IN BIRMINGHAM 
JACQUI SMITH JUST WHEN YOU 
THOUGHT IT COULD NOT GET ANY WERE 
US YOU LOST THE CAPITAL WAS IT 
LOCAL OR NATIONAL ISSUES WHICH SAW 
KEN DEFEATED AND BORIS TRIUMPHANT 
I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY A 
COMBINATION OF BOTH FIRSTLY FIRSTLY CONGRATULATIONS TO BORIS I THOUGHT 
HE WAS RIGHT TO PAID A TRIBUTE TO 
KEN THAT HE PAID BECAUSE KEN HAS 
TRANSFORMED LONDON THE WAY HE HAS 
DEVELOPED NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICING 
THE LEAD HE TOOK ON A SEVEN SEVENTHS WHEN 
LONDON FACED A TERRIBLE THREAT THE 
ROLE HE PLAYED IN WINNING THE 
OLYMPICS I THINK DESERVES 
CONGRATULATIONS BUT NUMBER ONE 
THIS WAS A BATTLE BETWEEN TWO 
LARGER THAN LIFE CHARACTERS AND 
THAT CERTAINLY WAS PART OF THE 
ELEMENT BUT SECONDLY I THINK IT 
DID REFLECT THE MESSAGE THAT PEOPLE 
WERE SENDING FROM THE VERY FIRST 
DAY WHICH IS WE ARE FEELING THE 
PINCH THE GOING IS GETTING TOUGH 
AND WE WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE TO 
THE GOVERNMENT 
YOU CANNOT TAKE MUCH COMFORT FROM 
THE FACT THE ELECTORATE WHERE 
TAKING OUT ANGER AGAINST LABOUR 
THEY DECIDED IT WAS TIME FOR A 
CHANGE IT MUST SEND SHIVER DOWN 
YOUR SPINE 
I AM NOT TAKING COMFORT 
IT HAS NOT BEEN A COMFORTABLE 
COUPLE OF DAYS THE BRITISH PUBLIC 
WERE SAYING YOU NEED A KICK UP THE 
BACKSIDE WE ARE FEELING THE PINCH 
WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING 
TO DO TO SUPPORT US THROUGH TOUGH 
TIMES THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO HEAR 
WE NEED TO DEMONSTRATE WE ARE 
ALONGSIDE AND LEADING THIS COUNTRY 
WHEN THEY ARE FACING DIFFICULTIES 
FROM THE CREDIT CRUNCH WHEN PRICES 
ARE GOING UP WHEN YOU ARE WORRIED 
ABOUT YOUR MORTGAGE AND HOW YOUR 
KIDS ARE GOING TO GET ON THE 
HOUSING LADDER 
THESE ARE THE 
THINGS THEY ARE PEOPLE ARE 
EXTREMELY WORRIED ABOUT ALL DAY 
YESTERDAY AND NOW WE ARE HEARING 
LABOUR POLITICIANS SAYING THEY WILL 
LISTEN ISN'T IT A HOSTAGE TO 
FORTUNE SAYING YOU WILL LISTEN TO 
PEOPLE DON SAYS LISTEN TO ME 
SUSPEND STAMP DUTY FOR FIRST TIME 
BUYERS LOWER FUEL TAX ABOLISH VAT 
ON DOMESTIC FUEL BILLS GORDON 
SHOULD TAKE THE HINT AND QUIT DAVE 
SAYS CALL A GENERAL ELECTION NOW 
WHICH OF THOSE THINGS ARE YOU GOING 
TO DO 
I THINK PEOPLE NEED US AS 
GORDON SAID YESTERDAY TO LEAD THEM 
THROUGH WHAT ARE DIFFICULT TIMES 
THEY TOLD US ON THURSDAY THAT THEY 
WERE NOT HAPPY WITH THE WAY THEY 
WERE FEELING WITH THE WAY FAMILY 
FINANCES WERE GOING AND THE 
CONFIDENCE THEY FELT IN THE COUNTRY

BREAKFAST THE HEADLINES BORIS 
JOHNSON HAS WON THE RACE TO BECOME 
THE NEXT MAYOR OF LONDON ENDING 
KEN LIVINGSTONE'S EIGHT YEAR REIGN 
AT CITY HALL THERE WILL BE CHURCH 
SERVICES IN PORTUGAL AND LEICESTER 
TO MARK A YEAR SINCE THE 
DISAPPEARANCE OF MADELEINE MCCANN 
STILL TO COME BEFORE NINE A M. WE WILL 
LOOK AT MOVES TO PROTECT CUSTOMERS 
BY FORCING BANKS TO IDENTIFY THEIR 
STAFF AS SALES PEOPLE WHEN THEY 
OFFER YOU FINANCIAL PRODUCTS 
ONCE THE SUN COMES OUT THIS WEEKEND 
IT WILL FEEL QUITE WARM LET'S BE 
REALISTIC IT IS A BANK HOLIDAY 
WEEKEND YOU WILL PROBABLY NEED 
YOUR RAIN JACKET AT SOME POINT 
FOREVER THE RAIN SHOULD BE LIGHT 
AND PATCHY AND TOWARDS WESTERN 
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THERE IS LOW 
PRESSURE IN THE ATLANTIC IT IS 
GETTING EVER CLOSER DURING THEIR 
NEXT FEW DAYS WITH HIGH PRESSURE 
TO THE EAST WHERE TREKKING IN 
WINDS IT WILL FEEL QUITE WARM 
WE ARE DRAGGING IN THE CLOUD WILL 
BE THICK ENOUGH AT TIMES FOR SOME 
PATCHY LIGHT RAIN FURTHER EAST 
IT WILL BE DRIER AND THE CLOUD WAS 
THIN AT TIMES TO ALLOW SUNSHINE 
THROUGH TEMPERATURES BY THE END OF 
THE MORNING TWELVE CELSIUS DOWN ACROSS 
THE BULK OF ENGLAND IT IS LOOKING 
DRIVE THERE WILL BE ONE OR TWO 
SPOTS OF RAIN DRY THE CLOUD 
WILL THIN AND THE SUNSHINE WILL 
COME AT BY THE END OF THE MORNING 
TEMPERATURES COULD BE UP TO FIFTEEN 
CELSIUS ALWAYS A CHANCE OF SEEING 
SPOTS OF RAIN IN DEVON AND CORNWALL 
THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF CLOUD 
AROUND AFTER A DAMP START IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND THERE WILL BE A 
BRIGHT SPELL TOWARDS THE END OF THE 
MORNING THE WINDS WILL TOUCH GALE 
FORCE AROUND THE IRISH SEA COASTS 
THERE WILL BE BURSTS OF RAIN IN 
THE BRIGHTER SKIES TOWARDS THE 
EAST NINETEEN CELSIUS IS POSSIBLE 
THROUGH THIS COMING EVENING AND 
OVERNIGHT WE HAVE GOT MORE IN THE 
WAY OF RAIN DEVELOPING TOWARDS THE 
REST WEST FURTHER EAST THERE 
WILL BE SOME DRIER WEATHER AROUND 
IT WILL BE A MILD NIGHT 
TEMPERATURES NO LOWER THAN TEN 
CELSIUS OR FOURTEEN CELSIUS A MILD START 
TO SUNDAY MORNING A BIT OF A DAMP 
DAY FOR PARTS OF SCOTLAND THE RAIN 
IN WALES AND THE SOUTH WEST 
INITIALLY IT WILL BE HEAVIER THAN 
THE RAIN WE WILL SEE TODAY IT WILL 
BRIGHTEN UP TOWARDS THE WEST LATER 
ON TEMPERATURES WILL BE LIFTED TO 
AND SIXTEEN CELSIUS OR NINETEEN CELSIUS 
SUFFOLK AND NORFOLK ON BANK HOLIDAY 
MONDAY COULD STAY DRY TOWARDS THE 
WEST IT WILL BE BRIGHT AND NOT A 
BAD BANK HOLIDAY MONDAY STILL 
FAIRLY WARM 
STUDENTS COULD BE PAYING BACK TOO 
MUCH ON THEIR STUDENT LOANS BECAUSE 
THE SYSTEM IS FLAWED BREAKFAST HAS 
FOUND OUT THAT GRADUATES ARE STILL 
BEING ASKED FOR PAYMENTS AFTER THEY 
HAD CLEARED THEIR LOAN IN FULL 
WHILE MANY STUDENTS WORRY ABOUT HOW 
THEY WILL PAY BACK THEIR LOAN WHEN 
THEY LEAVE UNIVERSITY SOME LIKE 
KATY LANGHAM HAVE A DIFFERENT 
PROBLEM SHE HAS PAID BACK TOO MUCH 
NOW SHE IS TRYING TO GET A REFUND 
FROM THE STUDENT LOANS COMPANY I I THINK THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS VERY 
FRUSTRATING FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME L. 
THINK MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DO NOT 
KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO CALL THE 
STUDENT LOANS COMPANY TO TELL THEM 
THEY HAVE FINISHED PAYING 
OFF THE 
LOAN 
I THINK PROBABLY 
OVERPAID BY ABOUT TWO THOUSAND L. HAVE 
ONLY RECEIVED ABOUT ONE THOUSAND TO DATE 
AND 
I DO 
NOT KNOW WHEN 
I GET 
THAT 
IF THAT 
IS THE 
FULL AMOUNT I 
AM DUE 
THE NATIONAL UNION 
OF STUDENTS 
SAYS 
THAT THE 
WAY THE 
SYSTEM IS DESIGNED 
MEANS ANY 
GRADUATE WHO HAS 
REPAYMENTS TAKEN FROM THEIR 
IS AT RISK OF PAYING BACK TOO MUCH 
IN THIS RESPECT THE STUDENT LOAN 
SYSTEM IS FLAWED IT IS POSSIBLE 
FOR ANY BORROWER TO OVERPAY ON THE 
AMOUNT OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT THAT 
THEY HAVE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE 
STUDENT LOANS COMPANY 
DOES NOT 
HAVE 
THAT INFORMATION 
ABOUT THE 
REPAYMENTS FROM ONE 
TAX YEAR 
TO THE 
NEXT 
THE STUDENT 
LOAN SYSTEM WAS 
CHANGED TEN 
YEARS AGO SO 
THAT IF 
A 
STUDENT LEAVES 
UNIVERSITY AND 
WORKS 
FOR AN 
EMPLOYER MONEY 
THEY OWE ON 
THEIR STUDENT 
LOAN IS TAKEN 
DIRECTLY FROM THEIR WAGE PACKET 
THE PROBLEM IS THEY ARE ONLY SENT A 
STATEMENT SAYING HOW MUCH THEY OWE 
ONCE A YEAR AND BY THE TIME THEY 
GET THE STATEMENT THE INFORMATION 
IS MONTHS OUT OF DATE THAT MAKES 
IT DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO 
CHECK HOW MUCH THEY OWE BECAUSE BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WORKS OUT WHETHER YOU 
OWE MONEY OR NOT YOU COULD JUST 
OWE A COUPLE OF POUNDS AND THEN IT 
CARRIES ON 
TAKING OUT 
MONEY 
RELATIVE TO 
YOUR INCOME 
SO IT 
COULD TAKE 
TENS TWENTIES 
OR 
HUNDREDS 
OF POUNDS 
OUT OF YOUR PAY 
PACKET EVERY MONTH 
THE GOVERMENT 
DENIES THE SYSTEM IS FLAWED BUT IS 
INTRODUCING IMPROVEMENTS FROM 
SEPTEMBER 
I HAVE INSTRUCTED THE SEPTEMBER STUDENT LOANS COMPANY TO MAKE 
CHANGES SO THAT FROM NEXT YEAR 
THERE WILL BE A PREDICTOR FACILITY 
SO THAT 
THE GRADUATE 
WILL KNOW WHEN 
IN THE 
FOLLOWING YEAR THEY 
LIKELY TO PAY THEIR 
LOAN OFF 
SO 
THEY CAN 
STEP OUT 
OF THE 
SYSTEM AND 
PAY THEIR LOAN 
MANUALLY THROUGH 
DIRECT DEBIT IT 
MEANS NO 
ONE 
SHOULD PAY MORE THAN THEY OWE THE THE CHANGES SHOULD MEAN FAR FEWER 
GRADUATES OVERPAY ON THEIR STUDENT 
LOANS BUT THE ONUS WILL STILL BE 
ON THE BORROWER TO MONITOR THEIR 
ACCOUNT AS THE NEW SYSTEM WILL NOT 
AUTOMATICALLY STOP TAKING PAYMENTS 
ONCE THE 
LOAN HAS BEEN PAID IN FULL 
WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO DEFINE A 
LINE A FINANCIAL EXPERT DAVID 
QUO ABOUT THIS THIS MORNING WE 
HAVE HAD ONE E. MAIL FROM SOMEONE 
WHO SAYS THEY HAVE PAID TWO THOUSAND 
TOWARDS A STUDENT LOAN BUT THE 
MONEY HAS ENDED UP WITH THE TAXMAN 
INSTEAD 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS A 
VERY GOOD MORNING TO YOU HOW DO 
YOU THINK BORIS IS FEELING THIS 
MORNING 
I WOKE UP IT IS ANOTHER MORNING DAY L. HAVE NEVER SEEN THE ETHNICS 
PLAY L. AM SURE THEY ARE A VERY 
COULD POP GROUP L. GOT A IT 
ROUTEMASTER 
TO GET THERE REFERRING REFERRING TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY 
BORIS JOHNSON OF YOU ARE PICKING 
UP ON HIS UNUSUAL WAY OF SPEAKING 
HE IS AN OLD ETONIAN HE IS PUBLIC 
SCHOOL HE IS POSH AND ECCENTRIC 
BUT HE IS A GREAT CHARACTER THEY 
ARE NOT MANY OF THOSE LEFT IN 
POLITICS BEHIND ALL THAT HE IS 
CLEVER AND SHREWD POLITICIAN IN IN THE GUARDIAN LONDON CHEESE IS 
MAYOR BORIS CHOOSE THIS IN THE 
DAILY EXPRESS BROWN AND ADD THEY 
SAY IT IS GORDON BROWN ALL BUT 
FINISHED AS PRIME MINISTER OUT 
IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH BORIS 
CLINCHES VICTORY INSIDE THE 
GUARDIAN BORIS'S BIG DAY WE WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN HE WOULD WIN 
YESTERDAY IT WAS THE FEAST DAY OF 
TSAR SAINT BORIS OF BULGARIA THE ONLY 
SAINT BORIS IN DEEP RELIGIOUS CALENDAR 
IT WAS THE ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH 
APPARENTLY HE WAS A GREAT SAINT 
BUT HE DOES HAVE A BIT OF A TEN PER 
HE WENT ON A MONASTIC RETREAT AND 
BLINDED HIS OWN SON RETREAT 
BORIS JOHNSON PAID KEN LIVINGSTONE 
A VERY FULSOME TRIBUTE KEN WAS 
CLEARLY MORE TO FIVE 
I THINK HE 
WAS FOR KEN DURING HIS HOLT 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN BOTH KEN AND 
BORROWERS WITH DESPERATE TO BE SEEN 
AS ORDINARY AND EVERY DAY BORIS 
FOR BORIS IT WAS I AM ON A 
BICYCLE I AM EVERY DAY ORDINARY 
NOW THE CAMERAS ARE OFF IT IS BACK 
TO THE OPULENT LIFESTYLE FOR BOTH 
OF THEM L. L. WAS GOING TO ASK ANDREW 
THEY ARE BOTH CELEBRITY POLITICIANS 
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT WHAT 
PERCENTAGE OF THE ELECTORS VOTED 
FOR BORIS BECAUSE THEY THINK HE IS 
A BUFFOON 
I THINK THEY VOTED FOR 
HIM BECAUSE THEY KNEW HIM THINGS 
LIKE PROGRAMMES SUCH AS HAVE I GOT 
NEWS FOR YOU KEN LIVINGSTONE 
THOUGHT HE COULD DO FOUR TURNS HE 
IS A GREAT CHARACTER AND HE IS 
AMUSING AND FUNNY WHEN DID YOU 
LAST HAVE A POLITICIAN THAT MADE 
YOU LAUGH WE ARE LAUGHING WITH 
THEM THE ONLY PAPER I FOUND ANY 
CHEER FOR GORDON BROWN THE SUN 
SAYS RIGHT AT THE END IT IS NOT 
ALL OVER YET DO NOT WRITE OFF MR. 
BROWN DESPITE THE WORST ELECTION 
PERFORMANCE WITH TWO USED TO GO 
HE CAN GET BACK IN THE DRIVING SEAT 
YEARS THAT IS A SIGN THAT THE 
MURDOCH PRESS MAY 
STILL STICK 
WITH 
LABOUR BUT THEY 
WILL READ 
THE RUNES 
IF HE 
IS STILL 
THAT AND PUBLIC 
OPINION IS LIKE THAT THERE IS NOT 
A PRAYER BABEL STICK WITH HIM THE THE CONTRAST BETWEEN GORDON BROWN IS SO 
DIFFERENT FROM BORIS JOHNSON 
GORDON BROWN CANNOT DO THE 
CELEBRITY POLITICIAN HE IS TO 
DOWER HE COULD NOT DO IT IF HE 
TRIED HAD THE SAME FEELING ABOUT 
BRIAN PADDICK L. ADMIRED HIS A 
NUMBER CHARISMA AT IN SOME SENSE 
FOR A POLITICAL PURPOSE NUMB 
ARE YOU GETTING TO THE STAGE WHERE 
WE WANT BORIS BECAUSE HE IS FLUFFY 
AND BUMBLING AND HE MIGHT MAKE 
MISTAKES IS THAT THE RIGHT ROAD 
THE TURNOUT WAS FORTY FIVE PER CENT WHEN WAS THERE 
LAST ELECTION WHERE THE CANDIDATES 
WERE KNOWN BY THEIR FIRST NAMES 
WITH A FORTY FIVE PER CENT TURNOUT 
MOVING ON FROM 
POLITICS TO FATHERHOOD DAVID

EPILEPSY RESEARCH CARRIED OUT AT 
GREAT ORMOND STREET CHILDREN'S 
HOSPITAL CLAIMS THE NUMBER OF 
SEIZURES EXPERIENCED BY CHILDREN

THEY CHANGE WHAT THEY EAT 
THOSE ARE THE MAIN STORIES NOW 
ALL THE SPORTS NEWS WITH MIKE 
WELCOME BACK RONNIE O'SULLIVAN IS 
SUCH AN INTERESTING CHARACTER LAST 
WEEK HE SAID THAT RUNNING WAS HIS 
MAIN PRIORITY NOW NOT SNOOKER BUT 
JUDGING BY LAST NIGHT I THINK HIS 
TRAINING SHOES WILL BE STAYING IN 
THE CUPBOARD FOR A COUPLE MORE DAYS 
BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS OPEN MOUTHED 
AT THE BRILLIANCE OF HIS SNOOKER 
YES RONNIE O'SULLIVAN HAS SUFFERED 
HIS UPS AND DOWNS BUT WHEN HE IS 
ON FORM THERE IS NO ONE BETTER 
EVEN STEPHEN HENDRY WAS LOST FOR 
WORDS AFTER BEING KNOCKED OUT BY 
THE ROCKET IN THE SEMI FINALS 
LOOK AT THE FACE OF STEPHEN HENDRY 
HERE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IT 
BECAUSE EVERYTHING THE ROCKET 
TOUCHED WENT IN EVEN IF IT WAS NOT 
THE POCKET HE WAS INTENDING 
O'SULLIVAN COMPLETED THE VICTORY A 
VIRTUAL REPEAT OF THE RESULT WHEN 
THE PAIR MET AT THE SAME STAGE BACK 
IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
THERE ARE CERTAINLY AREAS THAT I 
NEED TO IMPROVE ON BUT SESSIONS 
LIKE THIS BUILD YOUR CONFIDENCE 
NICELY AND YOU START TO GET 
COMFORTABLE AMONGST THE BALLS 
CAN'T BE TOO HARD ON MYSELF BUT I 
AM ALWAYS STRIVING TO HIT THE 
HEIGHTS THAT I AM CAPABLE OF AND I 
DON'T THINK THAT'S A BAD THING 
THAT'S AS COMPREHENSIVELY OUTPLAYED 
AS I HAVE EVER BEEN IN MY CAREER L. 
CAN'T REMEMBER LORRY MACRO MISSING 
A BALL THIS AFTERNOON GETTING OUT 
OF POSITION ER IT WAS JUST FULL 
PLUS SNOOKER OUTSTANDING LIKE ARE 
SAID TO HIM AFTERWARDS HIS SAFETY 
PLAY WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLE THE 
ONLY TIME I WAS COMING TO THE TABLE 
WAS TO BREAK OFF OR TO TRY TO GET 
OUT OF AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION YOU 
HAVE TO LOOK BACK AND ADMIRE IT 
BECAUSE IT WAS PERFECT SNOOKER 
PRAISE INDEED IT IS LOOKING AS IF 
THE NEXT PLAYER TO BE DAZZLED BY 
THE ROCKET WILL BE ALI CARTER HE 
IS AHEAD IN HIS SEMI FINAL THAT 
MATCH RESUMES AT TEN O'CLOCK 
FOOTBALL AND WHILE IT IS A DAY OF 
RECKONING IN THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE 
MANCHESTER UNITED NEED TO BEAT WEST 
HAM TO KEEP THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
TITLE CHASE IN THEIR OWN HANDS THIS 
AFTERNOON CHELSEA PLAY NEWCASTLE 
ON MONDAY AT THE BOTTOM SIX TEAMS 
ARE STILL IN THE FIGHT TO AVOID 
RELEGATION THE GAME AT CRAVEN 
COTTAGE IS RATHER LIKE A CUP FINAL 
ROY HODGSON'S SIDE LOOKED DOOMED 
HALFWAY THROUGH THE MATCH AT MAN 
CITY LAST WEEK BUT THEY THEN 
PROVED THEY HAVE GOT THE STOMACH 
FOR THE FIGHT 
AT FOUR O'CLOCK LAST SATURDAY ROY 
HODGSON LOOKED A BROKEN MAN HIS 
TEAM WERE TWO TO ZERO DOWN AND HEADING FOR 
RELEGATION THAT WAS UNTIL PERHAPS 
THE COMEBACK OF THE SEASON 
CERTAINLY IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT AT 
THE WEEKEND TO GET THAT VICTORY 
AND TO GIVE OURSELVES A CHANCE 
IT'S A SMALL CHANCE IT'S VERY 
VERY DIFFICULT JOB TO DO BECAUSE 
WE ARE THREE POINTS BEHIND OUR 
RIVALS WITH ONLY TWO MATCHES LEFT 
TO PLAY 
BUT AT LEAST THEY ARE 
STILL IN IT AHEAD OF WHAT IS SET 
TO BE A PIVOTAL MATCH PHRASES LIKE 
MUST WIN GAMES AND RELEGATION 
SIX POINTERS ARE SOMETIMES OVER 
USED IN FOOTBALL BUT NOT IN THIS 
CASE BECAUSE AT THE END OF TODAY 
EITHER BIRMINGHAM OR FULHAM COULD 
BE DOWN ALEX MCLEISH'S SIDE LET 
SLIP A TWO GOAL LEAD TO LIVERPOOL 
LAST WEEKEND SOME FANS OF FEARING 
THE WORST 
FULHAM AWAY AND 
BLACKBURN AT HOME ARE NOT THE 
EASIEST GAMES BUT THEN YOU LOOK AT 
THE OTHER TEAMS DOWN 
GOT TOUGH GAMES IT'S ALL 
DOWN TO BIRMINGHAM L. AM SURE THAT 
IF THEY PLAY TO THEIR POTENTIAL 
THEY CAN DO IT BUT I'M NOT 
CONVINCED 
BUT IF THE MANAGERS WILL CONVINCED BE HOLDING THEIR BREATH SO WILL 
THE FANS A MATCH TO TEST THE 
TOUGHEST FINGERNAILS IS ABOUT THE 
ONLY GUARANTEE 
THEY ALREADY LOOKED WELL CHEWED 
THOSE FINGERNAILS CELTIC CAN 
STRETCH THEIR LEAD AT THE TOP OF 
THE S. P. L. BY BEATING MOTHERWELL TODAY 
RANGERS PLAY TOMORROW 
TODAY CELTIC MUST DEAL WITH THE 
PRESSURE AS WELL AS THE PITCH 
SIMILAR TO LAST TIME WE'RE PLAYING 
ON A SURFACE THAT IS NOT CONDUCIVE 
TO GREAT FOOTBALL FOR BOTH SIDES 
SAYING THAT THE LAST TIME WE 
PLAYED THERE I LOOKED AT THE GAME 
AGAIN AND WE ACTUALLY PLAYED SOME 
HALF DECENT STUFF AT TIMES ON A 
SURFACE THAT WAS NOT CONDUCIVE 
RUGBY UNION AND IT HAS BEEN 
ANNOUNCED THAT THE ENGLAND STARS 
TOBY FLOOD AND MATTHEW TAIT WILL

THE PLANS FROM THE FINANCIAL 
REGULATOR WOULD STOP PEOPLE WHO 
WORK FOR BANKS AND INSURANCE 
COMPANIES USING THE WORD ADVICE OR 
ADVISER INSTEAD THEY WOULD HAVE 
TO BE CALLED SALES STAFF LET'S 
TALK TO PAUL NEWT PAUL LEWIS A 
VERY GOOD MORNING TO YOU ARE YOU A 
FINANCIAL ADVISER OR SALES ASSOCIATE 
ANYONE CAN CALL ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES A FINANCIAL ADVISER IT 
IS ONLY THE WORD INDEPENDENT THAT 
IS REGULATED THE F. S. A. SAYS THAT IT 
IS MISLEADING IF YOU GO TO A BANK 
OR BUILDING SOCIETY OR INSURANCE 
COMPANY SOMEONE IS CALLING 
THEMSELVES A FINANCIAL ADVISER 
THEY CAN ONLY SELL YOU THE PRODUCTS 
OF THAT COMPANY AT THE F. S. A. SAYS 
THEY ARE SALES STAFF THAT LABOUR 
SHOULD BE CHANGED TO SAY AS 
ASSOCIATE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
LABEL 
DO YOU MEAN THAT PEOPLE WILL LABEL LITERALLY BE LABELLED 
WHEN I SPOKE 
TO THE F. S. A. AND THEY SAID THEY WILL 
HAVE TO BE CALLED A SALES PERSON 
THE POINT IS THAT THEY SELL 
PRODUCTS FROM THEIR OWN COMPANIES 
WAS THAT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE 
F. S. A. SAYS TO BE AN ADVISER YOU 
HAVE TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE WHOLE 
UNIVERSE OF PRODUCTS AND FIND THE 
BEST ONE 
ULTIMATELY THE CUP 
ULTIMATELY THE CUSTOMER WILL BUY 
IT THEY WANT TO STOP THE BIG 
INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE BANKS 
ARE CHANGING PRICES AND COMMISSION 
ON THINGS TO PROMOTE PRODUCTS THEY 
WANT TO SELL AND STOP SELLING LESS 
PROFITABLE ONES A DO THAT ALL THE 
TIME AN INDEPENDENT ADVISER WILL 
HAVE TO BE INDEPENDENT OF 
COMMISSION THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT 
TO DO THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO 
ACHIEVE IT 
IF YOU ARE A FINANCIAL 
ADVISER YOU ARE SELLING SOMETHING 
YOU ARE NOT JUST GIVING ADVICE YOU 
ARE EVENTUALLY GOING TO OFFER A 
PRODUCT 
EVEN AN INDEPENDENT PRODUCT ADVISER ULTIMATELY THERE IS A SALE 
SOMEONE WHO IS LABELLED SALES 
ASSOCIATE ALL SALES STAFF WILL 
HAVE TO GIVE SOME KIND OF GUIDANCE 
ABOUT WHAT YOU NEED OTHERWISE YOU 
MIGHT AS WELL DO IT ON A COMPUTER 
AND NOT LOOK AT THESE HUMAN BEING 
AT ALL THE F. S. A. ADMITS IT HAS NOT 
SORT THIS OUT TALKING TO THEM 
THEY ARE VERY DETERMINED TO PUSH 
THIS THROUGH THERE IS A LITTLE WAY 
TO GO THERE IS ANOTHER REPORT IN 
OCTOBER AND MAYBE ANOTHER YEAR 
BEFORE IT HAPPENS 
IS IT NOT THE 
CASE THAT IF YOU 
GO INTO 
A 
BANK OR 
A BUILDING 
SOCIETY TO GET ADVICE 
A BUILDING SOCIETY TO GET ADVICE YOU SIMPLY KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE 
PUSHED PRODUCTS FROM THAT 
ORGANISATION IF YOU SPEAK TO AN 
ADVISER NOT LINKED TO AN 
ORGANISATION YOU KNOW THEY ARE NOT 
GOING TO DO THAT 
PEOPLE ARE NOT 
STUPID THEY KNOW THAT IS GOING TO 
HAPPEN INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL 
ADVISERS SAY WE ARE COMPLETELY 
DIFFERENT A DO NOT JUST ON THE 
WORD INDEPENDENT THEY WANT TO OWN 
THE WORDS FINANCIAL ADVISER AS WELL 
BUT THEY DO NOT THEY WANT OTHERS

IT IS CLAIMED 
THAT AMY WINEHOUSE IS NOT READY TO

WHEN IT COMES TO THE WORLD WATER 
BOMBING CHAMPIONSHIPS IT IS THE 
SIZE OF THE SPLASH THAT COUNTS THE 
DEFENDING CHAMPION DRESSED AS 
ELVIS WAS BEATEN BY A LOCAL RAG 
AND BONE MAN THE EVENT IS NOW IN 
ITS FOURTH YEAR IT RAISES 
THOUSANDS OF POUNDS FOR CANCER 
SUPPORT MIKE BUSHELL WOULD 
APPRECIATE THAT I THINK HE HAS 
DONE IT 
HE HAS DONE IT HE MADE A 
BIG SPLASH BUT NOT THE BIGGEST 
SPLASH 
WE'LL BE LOOKING BACK AT SPLASH SOME OF MIKE'S BIGGEST MOMENTS 
WHEN HE HAS BEEN TRYING HIS HAND AT 
DIFFERENT SPORTS OVER THE PAST 
COUPLE OF YEARS THAT IS COMING UP 
AT HALF PAST WHAT KIND OF MAYOR WE 
BORIS JOHNSON BE OUR SPECIAL 
CORRESPONDENT HAS BEEN CONSIDERING 
THE POSSIBILITIES 
HE HAD BEEN DISMISSED AS A JOKE A 
CLOWN BORIS THE BUFFOON A MAN 
DEFINED BY HIS HAIR BUT HE NOW 
RUNS ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT 
CAPITALS 
IT IS A DISGRACE THAT IN CAPITALS LONDON YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE IN 
MARKED THE END YOU ARE IN NEW YORK 
YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE MUGGED 
I THINK I WOULD HAVE TO COME UP 
WITH A PRETTY APPALLING GAFFE TO 
BLOW IT 
THE HOUSE WILL PROCEED 
BORIS JOHNSON WAS BRED FOR PUBLIC 
LIFE GLIDING FROM ETON TO OXFORD 
I DECLARE THE MOTION OVERWHELMINGLY 
CARRIED CARRIED MORE RECENTLY HE WAS JOURNALIST 
POLITICIAN MADE FAMOUS BY APPEARING 
ON T. V. SHOWS LIKE HAVE I GOT NEWS 
FOR YOU 
WE ALL KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE YOU 
BORIS 
BUT THERE WERE GAFFES AND BORIS APOLOGIES HE UPSET LIVERPUDLIANS 
HE SNIPED AT JAMIE OLIVER THE 
RESIDENTS OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA WERE 
LINKED TO AN ORGY OF CHIEF KILLING 
HE LIED ABOUT AN AFFAIR AND LOST 
HIS JOB THE QUESTION HANGING OVER 
HIS CAMPAIGN WAS IS BORIS JOHNSON 
SERIOUS DID HE REALLY WANT TO RUN 
LONDON THEY HAVE LOCKED ME OUT 
ELEVEN BILLION IS LOT OF MONEY TO 
PUT BORIS IN CHARGE OF FROM 
EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT HIM HE IS 
NOT A DETAILED MAN HE IS NOT 
SOMEONE WHO IS GUNNER MARRIAGE THAT 
BUDGET I SUSPECT IF HE DEVELOPS A 
GREAT STRENGTH WHO IS GOING TO 
MICRO MANAGE THAT BUDGET IT WILL 
BE THAT HE WILL PUT PEOPLE IN TO DO 
IT FOR HIM 
I HAVE BEEN AMAZINGLY IMPRESSED BY 
THE DETERMINATION WHICH HE HAS 
SHOWN NUMBER ONE HE HASN'T HAD 
DRINK FOR THREE MONTHS IF YOU GIVE 
UP DRINK FOR THREE MONTHS YOU HAVE 
TO BE SERIOUS YOU REALLY HAVE GOT 
TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE 
DOING NUMBER TWO HE HAS ASSUMED 
WHOLE LOT OF REALLY OBVIOUS JOKES 
WHICH COULD HAVE MADE AND HE IS A 
NATURAL HUMORIST 
AS THE CAMPAIGN 
WENT ON BORIS JOHNSON APPEARED 
MORE DISCIPLINED HE SEEMED TO 
DISCOVER A PASSION ABOUT BEING 
MAYOR 
WHAT HE HAD GOING FOR HIM MAYOR WAS THAT HE STOOD FOR CHANGE 
AGAINST A MAN WHO HAD BEEN EMPLOYED 
FOR EIGHT YEARS 
THAT'S MY LAST 
LEAFLET GREAT 
HE WAS EXCITED HE 
WAS NEW HE WAS VERY WELL KNOWN HE 
DID VERY WELL AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE L. 
THINK THEY LIKE THE ELEMENT IN 
BORIS JOHNSON THAT WAS RATHER LIKE 
KEN LIVINGSTONE USED TO BE 
IRREVERENT MISCHIEVOUS FUNNY 
BUT IF HE EMBARRASSES AND FAILS TO 
MEASURE UP IT COULD DAMAGE DAVID 
CAMERON HIS EFFORTS TO REBRAND HIS 
PARTY BORIS HAS PROVED DURING THIS 
CAMPAIGN THAT WHEN THE SERIOUS 
CHIPS ARE DOWN HE CAN PLAY THE 
GAME LIKE ANYBODY ELSE HE KNOWS IT 
IS IMPORTANT THAT THE CONSERVATIVES 
WIN THE ELECTION IN TWO THOUSAND TEN I DO NOT 
SEE HIM DOING ANYTHING TO 
DISCONCERT DAVID CAMERON SO BORIS 
JOHNSON THE MAN MANY REGARDED AS 
GAMBLE BY HIS PARTY HAS DELIVERED 
DAVID CAMERON THE MAJOR PRIZE OF A 
TORY LONDON BUT BORIS MAKES GOOD 
COPY GOOD T. V. AND OUT THERE THERE 
WILL BE THOSE WATCHING FOR EVERY 
SLIP OR MISTAKE 
JOINING ME NOW BORIS JOHNSON'S 
BIOGRAPHER HE CAN GIVE US MORE OF 
AN INSIDE GOOD MORNING ONE 
PERSON'S NATURAL HUMORIST IS 
ANOTHER PERSON'S CARTOON CLOW WHO 
IS THE REAL BORIS JOHNSON CLOWN 
HE IS A BRILLIANT JUMPER THERE IS 
NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT BUT HE IS ALSO 
SERIOUS AND IN THAT RESPECT HE IS 
LIKE SOME AMERICAN POLITICIANS 
LIKE ONEL SCHWARZENEGGER AND ONE 
ALL REGAN WHO WERE DISMISSED AS 
ACTORS BUT TURNED OUT TO BE GREAT 
POLITICIANS LIKE A ARNOLD 
SCHWARZENEGGER 
WE HEARD AMANDA SCHWARZENEGGER PLATELL SAYING HE IS NOT A 
DETAILED MAN LIKE ARNOLD 
SCHWARZENEGGER 
YES GORDON BROWN SCHWARZENEGGER IS A DETAILED MAN BUT HE CANNOT 
TAKE BIG DECISIONS BORIS JOHNSON 
IS ABLE TO DEVELOP AN EXTRAORDINARY 
RAPPORT WITH MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC 
EVEN THOSE WHO HATE POLITICIANS 
DID HE GET ELECTED BECAUSE OF HIS 
POLICIES FOR LONDON 
IT IS A 
TERRIBLE TIME TO BE A LABOUR 
CANDIDATE ALL THE OTHER TORIES 
WERE FRIGHTENED OF TAKING ON KEN 
NO OTHER MAJOR TORY WOULD COME 
FORWARD HE HAD THE COURAGE HE IS 
A BRAVE COPTIC POLITICIAN 
ONE TO 
BE REALLY KNOW ABOUT HIS POLICIES 
WHAT DO WE REALLY KNOW 
WE WILL 
SEE A COMPLETE CHANGE IN STYLE ON 
THINGS LIKE CRIME HE WILL BE MORE 
DETERMINED ON CRACKING DOWN ON 
CHILDREN I AGREE WITH HIM IT IS A 
AND AT A SCANDAL FOR CHILDREN TO 
COME AT A SCHOOL AND MAKE LIFE A 
NIGHTMARE FOR PEOPLE ON THE TOP 
DESK OF A BASS 
WE HAVE SEEN A LOT 
OF PERSONALITY AND A LOT OF STYLE 
HE WILL NEED TO APPOINT LOT OF 
PEOPLE BORIS IS INCAPABLE IN 
HIMSELF TO MAKE THE TRAINS RUN ON 
TIME HE IS VERY GOOD AT APPOINTING 
AND APPRECIATING PEOPLE WHO CAN DO 
THAT 
ANOTHER POINT OF HIS CAMPAIGN THAT IS HE CAN SAY THINGS WHICH CAN AT 
TIMES CAN OFFEND CERTAIN PEOPLE HE 
SEEMED TO SPEND SOME TIME 
EXPLAINING THINGS THAT CAN CAUSE 
OFFENCE 
I THINK KEN AND HIS PEOPLE OFFENCE NOT TO ANY READ MY BOOK ABOUT HIM 
WHICH KEN SAID WAS THE SCARIEST 
THING SINCE SILENCE SILENCE OF 
THE LAND L. THINK THEY ONLY REALLY 
TURNED PEOPLE AGAINST BORIS HE WERE 
ALREADY AGAINST HIM 
KICK TO TALK 
TO YOU THIS MORNING GOOD THE 
HEADLINES BORIS JOHNSON HAS WON 
THE RACE TO BECOME THE NEXT MAYOR 
OF LONDON ENDING KEN LIVINGSTONE'S 
EIGHT YEAR REIGN AT CITY HALL 
THERE WILL BE CHURCH SERVICES IN 
PORTUGAL AT LEICESTER TO MARK A 
YEAR SINCE THE DISAPPEARANCE OF 
MADELEINE MCCANN COMING UP BEFORE 
TEN A M. WILL EASTENDERS BE BREAKING 
OUT OF THE BUBBLY TONIGHT AT THE 
BRITISH SOAP AWARDS 
BEFORE ALL THAT LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
AT THE WEATHER IT IS A MIXED BAG 
ISN'T IT 
ALL OF US SHOULD GET ONE DRY AND 
SUNNY DAY IN THE BANK HOLIDAY 
WEEKEND SOME OF THE RAIN WILL BE 
WITH US TODAY MAINLY TOWARDS 
WESTERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IT 
WILL BE QUITE A WARM DAY WE HAVE 
GOT HIGH PRESSURE TOUR AS THE EAST 
AND LOW PRESSURE TOWARDS THE WEST 
IT IS LOW PRESSURE AIR TOWARDS THE 
WEST WHICH HAS BEEN 
SPEEDING IN 
A 
GOOD DEAL OF CLOUD THROUGHOUT THE 
NIGHT THERE ARE HOLES IN THE CLOUD 
IT IS BY NO MEANS A GREAT A FOR AT 
ALL OF US GREY DAY THERE SHOULD 
BE HOLES IN THE CLOUD IN THE EAST 
THAT WILL BE THE CASE IN THE SOUTH 
ACROSS MUCH OF ENGLAND IT WILL BE 
DRY THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE 
MORNING THERE ARE BIG HOLES IN THE 
CLOUD ONCE THE SUN COMES OUT IT 
WILL FEEL QUITE WARM SUNNY FORMAT 
OF THE DATE IN THE SOUTH EAST 
FOR MUCH OF THE DAY THE WIND IS 
COMING FROM A SOUTH EASTERLY 
DIRECTION AND WILL START TO FRESHEN 
THERE WILL BE A BRIGHTER END TO THE 
MORNING BEFORE WE SEEN RAY BEFORE 
WE SEE RAIN DEVELOPED IN THE WEST 
COME UP WE COULD SEE SOME RAIN THIS 
AFTERNOON BE FURTHER EAST IT WILL 
REMAIN DRY IN THE WEST WE COULD 
SEE TEMPERATURES PERHAPS CLIMBING 
UP TO TWENTY CELSIUS TONIGHT WE HOLD 
ON TO SOUTHERLY WINDS IT COULD BE 
WET AT TIMES ACROSS NORTHERN 
IRELAND AND WALES IN PARTICULAR 
FURTHER EAST ONE OF TWO SPLASHES 
OF RAIN TEMPERATURES NOT DROPPING 
TOO MUCH A PRETTY MILD START TO 
SUNDAY MORNING THERE WILL BE A BIT 
MORE RAIN AROUND TOMORROW SOME 
BRIGHTNESS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
HOLDING ON TO SOME SUNSHINE 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY ACROSS EAST 
ANGLIA AND THE SOUTH EAST IN 
BETWEEN WE WILL SEE CLOUDY SKIES 
AND THERE WILL BE SOME HEAVY PULSES 
OF RAIN IN WALES AND CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN ENGLAND TEMPERATURE IS 
STILL CLIMBING THAT IS BANK 
HOLIDAY MONDAY THE RAIN WILL PUSH 
TOWARDS THE EAST PARTS OF NORFOLK 
AND SUFFOLK COULD JUST ABOUT STAY 
DRY BUT FEEL COOL IN THE BREEZE 
SUNNY SKIES WILL BE OUT THERE 
TOWARDS THE WEST 
STUDENTS MAY BE PAYING BACK TOO 
MUCH MONEY ON THEIR STUDENT LOANS 
OVER TWENTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN 
OUT STUDENT LOANS WORTH EIGHTEEN BILLION 
BREAKFAST HAS FOUND OUT THAT 
GRADUATES ARE STILL BEING ASKED FOR 
PAYMENTS AFTER THEY HAVE CLEARED 
THEIR LOAN IN FULL WHILE MANY 
STUDENTS WORRY ABOUT HOW THEY WILL 
PAY BACK THEIR LOAN WHEN THEY LEAVE 
UNIVERSITY SOME LIKE KATY LANGHAM 
HAVE A DIFFERENT PROBLEM SHE HAS 
PAID 
BACK TOO 
MUCH NOW SHE 
TRYING TO GET A REFUND FROM THE 
STUDENT LOANS COMPANY I THINK THE 
WHOLE SYSTEM 
IS VERY FRUSTRATING 
FOR 
PEOPLE LIKE ME L. THINK MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DO NOT KNOW THAT 
THEY HAVE TO CALL THE STUDENT 
COMPANY TO TELL THEM FINISHED PAYING OFF 
THE LOAN 
L. 
THINK I 
HAVE PROBABLY 
OVERPAID BY 
ABOUT 
TWO THOUSAND I 
HAVE ONLY RECEIVED 
ABOUT ONE THOUSAND 
TO DATE AND 
I DO 
NOT 
KNOW WHEN 
I GET 
THAT IF THAT 
IS THE 
FULL AMOUNT I 
AM DUE 
THE NATIONAL 
THE NATIONAL UNION 
OF STUDENTS 
SAYS THAT THE 
THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED 
MEANS ANY 
GRADUATE WHO HAS 
LOAN REPAYMENTS 
TAKEN FROM THEIR 
WAGES IS 
AT RISK 
OF PAYING BACK TOO MUCH 
IN THIS 
RESPECT THE STUDENT LOAN SYSTEM IS 
FLAWED IT IS POSSIBLE FOR ANY 
BORROWER TO OVERPAY ON THE AMOUNT 
OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT THAT THEY HAVE 
SIMPLY BECAUSE THE STUDENT LOANS 
COMPANY DOES 
NOT HAVE THAT 
INFORMATION ABOUT 
THE REPAYMENTS 
FROM ONE TAX 
YEAR TO 
THE NEXT THE 
STUDENT LOAN 
SYSTEM WAS CHANGED 
YEARS AGO SO THAT 
IF A 
STUDENT 
LEAVES UNIVERSITY 
AND WORKS 
FOR AN 
EMPLOYER 
MONEY THEY 
OWE ON THEIR 
STUDENT LOAN 
IS TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM 
STUDENT LOAN IS TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM THEIR WAGE PACKET THE PROBLEM IS 
THEY ARE ONLY SENT A STATEMENT 
SAYING HOW MUCH THEY OWE ONCE A 
YEAR AND BY THE TIME THEY GET THE 
STATEMENT THE INFORMATION IS 
MONTHS OUT OF DATE THAT MAKES IT 
DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO 
CHECK HOW MUCH THEY OWE BECAUSE BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WORKS OUT WHETHER YOU 
OWE MONEY OR NOT YOU COULD JUST 
OWE A COUPLE OF POUNDS AND THEN IT 
CARRIES 
ON TAKING 
OUT MONEY 
RELATIVE 
TO YOUR 
INCOME SO IT 
COULD TAKE 
TENS TWENTIES OR 
HUNDREDS OF 
POUNDS OUT OF YOUR PAY 
PACKET EVERY MONTH 
THE GOVERMENT 
DENIES THE SYSTEM IS FLAWED BUT IS 
INTRODUCING IMPROVEMENTS FROM 
SEPTEMBER 
I HAVE INSTRUCTED THE SEPTEMBER STUDENT LOANS COMPANY TO MAKE 
CHANGES SO THAT FROM NEXT YEAR 
THERE WILL BE A PREDICTOR FACILITY 
SO THAT 
THE GRADUATE 
WILL KNOW WHEN 
IN THE 
FOLLOWING YEAR THEY 
LIKELY TO PAY THEIR 
LOAN OFF 
SO 
THEY CAN 
STEP OUT 
OF THE SYSTEM 
PAY THEIR LOAN MANUALLY THROUGH 
DIRECT DEBIT IT MEANS NO ONE 
SHOULD PAY MORE THAN THEY OWE THE THE CHANGES SHOULD MEAN 
FAR FEWER 
GRADUATES OVERPAY ON THEIR STUDENT 
LOANS BUT THE ONUS WILL STILL BE 
ON THE 
BORROWER TO MONITOR 
ACCOUNT AS THE NEW 
SYSTEM WILL 
NOT 
AUTOMATICALLY STOP 
TAKING PAYMENTS 
ONCE THE LOAN HAS BEEN PAID IN FULL 
DAVID QUAYLE IS FROM THE FINANCIAL 
DISCUSSION ADVICE WEBSITE LET'S 
SORT THIS OUT BILL RAMMELL SAID HE 
HAS A SOLUTION AND IT WILL CHANGE 
IN SEPTEMBER WILL IT SOLVE THE 
PROBLEM 
I DO NOT THINK SO PART OF PROBLEM THE PROBLEM WITH THE STUDENT LOAN 
SYSTEM IS THAT IT IS UNNECESSARILY 
CLUNKY YOU HAD A SYSTEM WHERE 
STUDENTS BORROW THE MONEY OVER A 
PERIOD OF TIME AND THEY DO NOT HAVE 
TO REPAY IT UNTIL THEY EARN OVER 
FIFTEEN THOUSAND THE PROBLEM ARISES BECAUSE 
IT IS SO BUREAUCRATIC YOUR WAGES 
ARE DEDUCTED BY YOUR EMPLOYER THE 
MONEY IS THEN PAID OVER TO THE 
INLAND REVENUE THE HMRC WHO THEN 
SITS ON THE MONEY FOR A YEAR BEFORE 
THEY PAY IT TO THE STUDENT LOAN 
COMPANY IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO 
ASSUME THAT CERTAIN MISTAKES WILL 
BE MADE ALONG THE WAY 
ONE OF THE 
PROBLEMS IS THAT STUDENTS 
THEMSELVES ARE NOT ABLE TO LOOK AT 
ANY POINT AT WHERE THEY ARE IN 
THEIR LOAN TO LOOK AT WHAT THEY 
STILL OWN 
YOU CAN PHONE UP THE 
STUDENT LOANS COMPANY AND ASK THEM 
HOW MUCH YOUR OWN THEY WILL NOT BE 
ABLE TO TELL YOU THAT L. DO NOT 
UNDERSTAND IN THIS DAY AND AGE OF 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WHY THE 
MONEY CANNOT BE PAID OVER STRAIGHT 
AWAY TO BE STUDENT LOANS COMPANY 
AND SEE YOUR DEBT BEING DEDUCTED 
YOU CAN DO IT WITH CREDIT CARDS AND 
BANK STATEMENTS WHY KENNY NOT DO 
IT WITH SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS A 
STUDENT LOAN CAN YOU 
THERE ARE 
PEOPLE'S THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO 
START A YEAR OWING A SMALL AMOUNT 
AND THEY CARRY ON PAYING FOR THE 
WHOLE YEAR 
AS LONG AS YOU OWE 
MONEY MONEY WILL BE DEDUCTED FROM 
WAGES WHEN STUDENTS START OFF IN 
WORKING LIFE THEY ARE ACTUALLY 
EARNING A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY 
EARLY EVERY PENNY COUNTS TWO HAVE 
NINE PER CENT OF YOUR SALARY OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND

OF THE HUGE FENCE IS FACING THE 
COURSES ON THE BADMINTON CROSS 
COUNTRY COURSE NOW A SUMMARY OF 
THIS MORNING'S HEADLINES BORIS 
JOHNSON HAS BEEN ELECTED THE NEW 
MAYOR OF LONDON ENDED A 
CATASTROPHIC DAY FOR LABOUR IN THE 
LOCAL ELECTIONS HE PULLED A 
MILLION VOTES WINNING BY A MARGIN 
OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND IT BRINGS TO AN END KEN 
LIVINGSTONE A COST OF HIS EIGHT 
YEAR REIGN OF THE CAPITAL CUTTING CUTTING CRIME IMPROVING TRANSPORT 
PROTECTING GREEN SPACE DELIVERING 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING GIVING TAX 
PAYERS OF VALUE FOR MONEY IN EVERY 
ONE OF THE THIRTY TWO BOROUGHS 
LET'S SPEAK 
TO OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT WHO 
JOINS US NOW THIS CROWNS A GOOD 
NIGHT FOR THE CONSERVATIVES YES YES IT EVEN SURPASSED THEIR OWN 
EXPECTATIONS TO HAVE THIS VICTORY 
IS A BIG HIGH FOR THEM L. THINK IT IS INTERESTING IN BORIS JOHNSON 
YOU HAVE A MAN WITH NO EXPERIENCE 
OF RUNNING ANYTHING HE HAS A BIG 
PERSONALITY HE COULD BE A THORN IN 
THE SIDE FOR DAVID CAMERON IF WE 
WATCHED DAVID CAMERON TAKING IN THE 
RESULT HE SEEMS PLEASED ABOUT IT 
I THEREFORE OFFICIALLY DECLARED 
BORIS JOHNSON BRILLIANT 
FANTASTIC WELL DONE FANTASTIC 
THAT WAS SO DRAWN OUT IT WAS AGONY 
WE'VE GOT TO WATCH THIS SPEECH 
BRILLIANT BRILLIANT WHAT ABOUT KEN LIVINGSTONE WHAT 
DOES THAT DEFEAT MEAN FOR GORDON 
BROWN 
I THINK IT IS DIFFICULT BUT BROWN WITH BOTH BORIS AND TEN THEY ARE 
SUCH BIG PERSONALITIES IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT IT MEANS FOR 
THE PARTIES KEN BUT CLEARLY FOR 
GORDON BROWN THIS HAS BEEN A 
DISASTER BORIS AND KEN HE IS 
SAYING HE WILL LISTEN AND LEARN 
BUT WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN 
THERE ARE SOME LABOUR M. P.'S WHO WANT 
GORDON BROWN TO BECOME MORE LEFT 
WING THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 
AND THERE WILL BE OTHERS WHO WANT A 
NEW LEADER THAT'S NOT GOING TO 
HAPPEN IN THE SHORT TERM EITHER 
THERE MAY BE SOME BACKBENCHERS 
WITH MARGINAL SEATS WHO FEAR THAT 
GORDON BROWN MAY NOT BE THE PERSON 
TO TAKE THEM FORWARD 
IT WAS ALWAYS 
A TWO HORSE RACE THIS WASN'T IT 
YES IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE 
DIFFICULT FOR THE LIB DEM CANDIDATE 
BUT HE MAY BE HOPING FOR SOME ROLE 
IN THE NEW ADMINISTRATION 
FOR NEW 
MAYOR SAID LET'S GET CRACKING 
TOMORROW LET'S HAVE A DRINK 
TONIGHT THIS IS THE SCENE OUTSIDE 
HIS HOUSE THIS MORNING THERE WAS 
AN EMPTY BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE 
OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE ON THE DOORSTEP

FLOWERS IN IT HOW MUCH DO WE KNOW 
ABOUT HIS POLICIES AT THIS STAGE 
NOT AN AWFUL LOT HE HAS TALKED 
ABOUT SCRAPPING BENDY BUSES AND 
HELPING PEOPLE IN THE SUBURBS 
MAKING CHANGES TO THE CONGESTION 
CHARGE BUT IT IS A BIG JOB IT'S 
THE FIRST BIG JOB FOR 
CONSERVATIVE FOR A VERY LONG TIME 
AND HE IS A MAN WITH NO EXPERIENCE 
AND PEOPLE MIGHT BE THINKING 
DAVID CAMERON IS MAN OF LITTLE 
EXPERIENCE AS WELL O. M. E. OTHER

EVENING SESSION AFTER WINNING HIS 
TWELFTH FRAME IN A ROW HENDRY COULD 
NOT BELIEVE WHAT HE WAS SEEN 
O'SULLIVAN WILL MEET EITHER ALI 
CARTER OR JOE PERRY CARTER IS 
LEADING THE OTHER SEMI FINAL 
I AM CERTAINLY NOT ON MY A GAME 
THERE ARE AREAS ON WHICH I NEED TO 
IMPROVE BUT THE SESSION LIKE 
TONIGHT BUILDS CONFIDENCE NICELY 
AND YOU START TO GET COMFORTABLE 
AMONGST THE BALLS SO I CAN'T GET 
TOO HARD ON MYSELF BUT I AM ALWAYS 
STRIVING TO HIT THE HEIGHTS THAT I 
KNOW I AM CAPABLE OF AND I DON'T 
THINK THAT'S A BAD THING 
THAT IS 
AS COMPREHENSIVELY OUTPLAYED AS I 
HAVE EVER BEEN IN MY CAREER BUT 
CAN'T REMEMBER RONNIE MISSING A 
BALL THIS AFTERNOON OR GETTING OUT 
OF POSITION IT WAS JUST FULL PLUS 
SNOOKER IT WAS OUTSTANDING AS I 
SAID TO HIM AFTERWARDS HIS SAFETY 
PLAY WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLE IT WAS 
JUST FAULTLESS SNOOKER IT WAS 
JUST FOR COS SNOOKER YOU HAVE TO 
ADMIRE IT IT WAS PERFECT SNOOKER 
IT WAS JUST FOUR TO US SNOOKER FAULTLESS TODAY IS A DAY OF

DIFFICULT JOB STILL BECAUSE WE ARE 
THREE POINTS BEHIND OUR RIVALS 
WITH ONLY TWO MATCHES LEFT TO PLAY 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S NICE TO 
BE IN THERE WITH A FULL HOUSE 
TOMORROW AND A VERY EXCITING AND 
PASSIONATE ATMOSPHERE I AM SURE 
AND ONE CANNOT ASK FOR MORE THAN 
THAT WITH THE TYPE OF SEASON WE 
HAVE HAD 
CELTIC CAN STRETCH THEIR 
LEAD OVER RANGERS TO THE AT THE 
TOP OF THE S. P. L. TODAY LAST WEEK'S 
VICTORY OVER RANGERS HAS REIGNITED 
CELTIC'S HOPES OF TAKING THE TITLE 
TODAY THEY MUST COPE WITH THE 
PITCH AS WELL AS THE PRESSURE 
SIMILAR TO LAST TIME IT IS A 
SERVICE WHICH IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO 
GREAT FOOTBALL FOR BOTH SIDES IN 
SAYING THAT THE LAST TIME WE 
PLAYED THERE I LOOKED AT THE GAME 
AGAIN AND WE ACTUALLY PLAYED SOME 
HALF DECENT STUFF AT TIMES ON 
SURFACE WHICH WAS NOT CONDUCIVE TO 
PLAYING GOOD FOOTBALL

THE ATHLETE 
YOU GET GREAT ADRENALIN WHEN YOU'RE 
ON THE START LINE WITH FORTY OTHER 
RIDERS WORSE THAN DEATH THAT WAS GOOD COME ON

EXPERIENCE IN THAT HAMSTER BALL EIGHTEEN 
MONTHS AGO IF YOU WANT TO WATCH 
MORE OF THOSE UNUSUAL CHALLENGES

PIECE WE'LL HAVE MORE INFORMATION

COST THEM EXCEPT THAT'S NEXT WEEK 
IT IS A YEAR SINCE THREE YEAR OLD 
MADELEINE MCCANN WENT MISSING FROM 
A HOLIDAY APARTMENT IN PORTUGAL 
THE INCIDENT IS STILL HAVING AN 
IMPACT ON THE PORTUGUESE VILLAGE 
WHERE THE FAMILY WAS STAYING AT THE 
TIME JOINING US NOW THE MANAGING 
DIRECTOR OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 
NEWSPAPER WHO IS WITH OUR 
CORRESPONDENT CORRESPONDENT YES WE ARE OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT 
WHERE MADELEINE WAS LAST SEEN ONE 
YEAR AGO TODAY DESPITE AN 
EXTRAORDINARY YEAR OF SPECULATION 
AND RUMOUR AND DEBATE WE'RE STILL 
NO CLOSER TO KNOWING WHAT HAPPENED 
TO MADELEINE ON THAT THURSDAY NIGHT 
LET'S TALK NOW TO SOMEONE WITH WHOM 
WE HAVE SPOKEN MANY TIMES OVER THE 
PAST YEAR IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE 
THAT ONE YEAR HAS GONE DO YOU 
THINK TODAY HAS ANY RELEVANCE OR 
SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE LOCAL PEOPLE 
THE PEOPLE OF PRAIA D. A. LUZ 
I THINK IN THE MAIN THAT A LOT OF 
THE LOCAL PEOPLE ARE HOPING THAT 
TODAY WILL MARK THE ANNIVERSARY 
AND THEN WE WILL 
TO 
MOVE ON BECAUSE FOR SUCH LONG 
TIME NOW PEOPLE HAVE FELT THAT 
THEIR LIVES HAVE BEEN ON HOLD THEY 
HAVE FELT THAT PRAIA D. A. LUZ HAS 
BEEN THE SUBJECT OF CHILD GOING 
MISSING RATHER THAN BEING ONE OF 
THE PARTS OF GOD'S HEAVEN WHERE 
THE PUBLIC LOVES TO COME FROM ALL 
OVER THE WORLD AND ENJOY THE 
SUNSHINE AND THE SEA HERE HOW HOW WOULD PEOPLE HAVE DESCRIBED PRAIA 
D. A. LUZ AS AN AREA BEFORE THIS 
HAPPENED DO YOU FEEL THEY STILL 
TALK ABOUT IN THE SAME TERMS NOW 
THE LOCAL PEOPLE STILL CONSIDER 
THIS TO BE A LOVELY LITTLE VILLAGE 
IN FACT IT HAS GROWN INTO TOWN 
NOW WHERE YOU CAN COME AND SAFELY 
ENJOY GOOD HOLIDAY IN EXCELLENT 
COMPANY AT VERY REASONABLE PRICES 
DESPITE THE POUND SO I THINK THAT 
IS WHAT THE PORTUGUESE AND THE 
EXPATS HERE STILL LIKE TO FEEL THAT 
THIS IS THE IMAGE OF PRAIA D. A. LUZ 
AND THEY REALLY WOULD LIKE TO MOVE 
AWAY FROM THE MISSING CHILD 
SYNDROME WITH WHICH IT HAS BEEN 
ATTACHED 
BECAUSE WE TRY TO TALK TO ATTACHED PEOPLE ABOUT WHETHER THEY FEEL THE 
INDUSTRY THE TOURISM INDUSTRY HAS 
BEEN AFFECTED AND IT SOUNDS CRAWL 
TO TALK ABOUT THAT SIDE OF IT BUT 
IT IS A PHENOMENALLY IMPORTANT PART 
OF THE ECONOMY HERE IN THE ALGARVE 
WHAT SENSE YOU GET AS TO WHETHER IT 
HAS MADE AN IMPACT ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY TOURISM IS OUR BIGGEST INDUSTRY IN 
PORTUGAL AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT 
THAT WE NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THAT L. 
THINK EVERYBODY WOULD EXCEPT THAT 
THAT IS THE CASE L. THINK THAT WHAT 
PEOPLE ARE SAYING NOW IS THAT THEY 
DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT MADELEINE 
A LONGER WHICH IS VERY SAD FOR THE 
PARENTS AND THEIR FAMILY OF COURSE 
BUT THAT THEY HAVE TO MOVE ON 
ANY LONGER BUT THIS IS STILL THE 
MOST DESIRABLE PLACE TO COME IN 
EUROPE WE ARE SEEING A SLIGHT 
SLOWDOWN IN TOURISM AT THE MOMENT 
WE ARE NOT SURE IF THAT IS BECAUSE 
WE ARE IN BETWEEN HOLIDAYS AND WE 
HAVE NOT ACTUALLY STARTED THE 
SUMMER SEASON YET WHETHER THE 
POUND SLASH EURO IS HAVING AN EFFECT I 
DO NOT REALLY BELIEVE THAT 
MADELEINE GOING MISSING FROM HERE 
HAS MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE TO 
TOURISM IN THIS AREA JANE MANY MANY THANKS FOR NOW 
THERE WILL BE A CHURCH SERVICE 
TONIGHT HERE IN PRAIA D. A. LUZ AN 
EARLY EVENING CHURCH SERVICE THAT 
THEY ARE CALLING A SERVICE OF HOPE 
WE WILL HAVE FULL COVERAGE 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY HERE ON B. B. C. NEWS 
YOU ARE WATCHING BREAKFAST LET'S 
UPDATE YOU ON OUR HEADLINES BORIS 
JOHNSON HAS BECOME THE NEXT MAYOR 
OF LONDON ENDING KEN LIVINGSTONE'S 
EIGHT YEAR REIGN AT CITY HALL 
THERE WILL BE CHURCH SERVICES IN 
PORTUGAL AND IN LEICESTERSHIRE 
TODAY TO MARK ONE YEAR SINCE THE 
DISAPPEARANCE OF MADELEINE MCCANN 
SOME WOULD SAY LONDON FOUND ITS 
VOICE TONIGHT IT WAS THE SOUND OF 
AN OXFORD OXBRIDGE EDUCATED 
CONSERVATIVE MAYBE IT WAS THE 
ACCENT THAT WON IT WHO BETTER THAN 
MARK PERRY TO ANSWER IT VOICES ARE 
YOUR THING THESE TWO ARE WONDERFUL 
IN TERMS OF CONTRAST 
IT WAS 
CHRISTMAS THIS ELECTION PARAM 
MACRO ME FOR ME YOU HAVE GOT SO 
MUCH IN THEIR VOICES YOU HAVE THE 
NASAL TONES THE GREEN OVERCOAT MAY 
HAVE LOST ME THE ELECTION YOU CAN 
JUST BUMBLE AND STUMBLE ALONG WITH 
BORIS BRIAN PADDICK WAS A BIT OF A 
PROBLEM HE WAS ALWAYS A BIT SCARED 
RABBIT AND OF THE HEADLAND HE WAS 
A LITTLE BOY LOCKED IN A CUPBOARD 
HEAD LIGHT FOR WEEKS ON END AND 
GEROME NEL PRESTON AND SAID WHO 
ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP YOUR SECOND 
VOTE PREFERENCE TO ANDREW MCNEIL 
HE SAID YOU CANNOT MAKE ME TELL 
YOU HE SAID IF I TELL YOU I WILL 
HAVE TO KILL YOU 
IT IS ABOUT THE 
MANNERISMS ISN'T IT THE VOICE IS 
ONE THING BUT THE WAY HE RESPONDS 
TO THINGS 
HE IS A CARTOON 
POLITICIAN SLIGHTLY WORRYING I 
HAD TO SAY THIS ISSUE OF I DO 
FEEL HE IS PLAYING UP TO BEING A 
CELEBRITY AS MUCH AS A POLITICIAN 
IT WORRIES ME THAT POLITICAL 
SERVICE IS BEING FORGOTTEN AS 
BECOMING MORE ABOUT SELF PROMOTION 
HE TOOK A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD IS 
THAT WHITE PEOPLE VOTED FOR HIM 
THEY WANTED SOMEONE WHO WOULD MAKE 
THEM LAUGH AND BE HIGH PROFILE 
THEN IT IS BECOMING PERSONALITIES 
RATHER THAN POLICIES L. FIND IT A 
WORRY WHEN A NUMBER OF M. P.'S ARE 
APPEARING ON THE CELEBRITY CIRCUIT 
THE PANEL SHOWS QUIZ GAMES 
REALITY SHOWS THESE ARE ASKING 
BLASTING HOURS AND DAYS THEY ARE 
SPENDING THEIR TIME ON OUR MONEY 
FOR WHAT I THINK IS PURE SELF 
PROMOTION AS OPPOSED TO M. P.'S WHO ARE 
APPEARING ON THE MEDIA TO PROMOTE 
ISSUES 
WE HAVE GOT OUR CAMERAS ISSUES TRAINED ON BORIS'S HOUSE THIS 
MORNING HE HAS NOT EMERGED WHAT 
MIGHT HE SAY AS HE EMERGES AS AS BORIS EMERGES IT HAS BEEN A LONG 
BATTLE REPORTEDLY BY ONE I'M 
GOING TO GET RID OF BENDY BUSES 
I'D WON L. KNOW ROUTEMASTER IS CAST 
NINETY EIGHT MILLION BUT BEFORE I HAD SAID 
THEY COST EIGHT MILLION IT IS A BIT OF 
A WORRY WITH BORIS THAT HE CAN GET 
SUMS WRONG 
ARE YOU GOING TO 
MISDOING KEN 
OH YEAH I USED TO 
DO HIM CONSTANTLY L. HOPE HE STAYS 
IN PUBLIC LIFE L. WILL NOT BE ABLE 
TO STOP DOING THAT 
THANK YOU FOR 
JOINING US BADMINTON HORSE TRIALS 
ARE THIS WEEKEND AND IT HAS BEEN 
SEEN AS A BIG EQUESTRIAN TEST 
BEFORE THE BEIJING GAMES WHAT WILL 
OUR OLYMPIC HOPEFULS BE UP AGAINST 
TODAY NICK HIGHAM IS THERE FOR US 
IN THE MIDDLE OF BADMINTON PARK IN 
THE BACKGROUND YOU CAN SEE THE 
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY FACADE OF BADMINTON

COUNTRY COURSE TWENTY NINE FENCES WE ARE 
STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
COURSE THE RIDERS WILL BE COMING 
UP THE SIDE OF THIS SMALL LAKE AND 
THEY ARE GOING TO GO OVER A SERIES 
OF 
FENCES AROUND 
THE LAKE THERE 
ARE A COUPLE OF PICK UP TRUCKS 
THEY ARE GOING TO SWEEP AROUND IN 
FRONT OF THE CROWD ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
ARE EXPECTED THEY WILL GO WHERE 
THE TWO FENCES AND INTO THE LAKE

THE LITTLE FENCES AND JUMP UP 
ANOTHER FENCE TO GET OUT THE MAN 
WHO BUILT THE COURSE IS HUGH THOMAS 
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO 
WE HAVE 
GOT THE BEST HORSES AND RIDERS IN 
THE WORLD IT IS THE PREMIER 
COMPETITION IN THE WORLD OTHER THAN 
THE OLYMPIC GAMES WE ARE TRYING TO 
TEST THEM THE TRAINING THE 
EXPERIENCE THEY HAVE GOT HOW WELL 
PREPARED THE COURSES ARE WE ARE 
TRYING TO BE FAIR TO THEM AT THE 
SAME TIME HORSES 
FOR THOSE WHO 
DO NOT KNOW EVENTING IS AN 
INTERESTING SPORT 
UP UNTIL SOON 
AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR IT WAS 
ONLY OPENED TO OFFICERS FROM THE 
ARMED SERVICES THE DRESSAGE WAS 
MEANT TO REPLICATE THE PARADE 
GROUND THE CROSS COUNTRY WAS MEANT 
TO REPLICATE BATTLE THE SHOW 
JUMPING WAS RELIEVED TO SEE THAT 
THE FORCES WERE FIT AND SOUND AFTER 
THEY HAD BEEN THROUGH THE RIGOURS 
OF THE CROSS COUNTRY HORSES THE THE CAUSE HAS BECOME A BIT SHORTER 
HASN'T IT 
IT HAS BECOME SHORTER 
IT IS A LOT SIMPLER TO UNDERSTAND 
NOW IT IS A LOT MORE TECHNICAL 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MODERN SPORT 
RATHER THAN AN ARMY OFFICER'S AND 
RECREATION A FEW YEARS AGO IT HAS 
GOT MORE TECHNICALLY DIFFICULT AND 
HORSES AND RIDERS ARE BETTER 
TRAINED EVERY YEAR 
ONE OF THE 
THINGS THAT ALWAYS COMES UP IN 
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT EVENTING IS 
SAFETY NINE RIDERS HAVE DIED IN 
THE SPORT IT SEEMS A LOT HOW DO 
YOU MAKE A COURSE LIKE THIS STATE 
I EXPECT YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT THE 
FIGURES WE TRY TO USE OUR 
EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE A LOT OF 
PEOPLE COME TO CHECK IT OUT 
ALTHOUGH IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY 
THERE ARE SAFETY CHECKS AND 
BALANCES PUT IN THERE SO THAT I DO 
NOT ASK STUPID QUESTIONS OF THE 
HORSES AND RIDERS WE HAVE 
INTRODUCED FEW NEW IDEAS SUCH AS 
PINS WHICH CAN BREAK IF THEY LOOKS 
LIKE BEING BAD FALL WE ARE 
SEEING A VERY ROUNDED PROFILE ON 
THE TOP IF A HORSE OF DOES NOT 
TOUCH THEM DARES TOUCH THEM HE 
CAN SLIDE INTO THE WATER
