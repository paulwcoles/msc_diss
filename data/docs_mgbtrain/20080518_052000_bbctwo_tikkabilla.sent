OH WOW 
WOW LOOK HOW HIGH YOU CAN THROW THEM 
THEY'RE FLYING THROUGH THE SKY 
HEY I KNOW WHAT ELSE FLIES IN THE SKY 
A ROCKET 
AS I SAID WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A ROCKET 
TO MAKE OUR ROCKET WE'RE GOING TO NEED SOME FOIL SOME SCISSORS 
SOME STICKY TAPE A KITCHEN ROLL TUBE 
TWO SWEETIE TUBES SOME BLUE PAPER 
SOME LITTLE BLACK STICKY CIRCLES 
AND SOME COLOURED TISSUE PAPER 
NOW THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO 
IS COVER OUR TUBES WITH FOIL 
START WITH THE BIG TUBE FIRST 
TEAR OFF SOME FOIL 
WE DON'T NEED SCISSORS FOR THIS 
AND THEN 
THEN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS JUST FOLD DOWN THE EDGES 
THERE WE GO 
THAT'S THE FIRST PART OF OUR ROCKET 
DO THE SAME WITH YOUR SMALL TUBES 
LITTLE BIT OF FOIL 
AND THEN JUST ROLL 
YOUR TUBE UP 
THIS ROCKET'S GOT A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH FOIL AT THE END THERE 
LET'S SNIP IT OFF WITH OUR SCISSORS 
THEN JUST PUSH THAT INTO YOUR TUBE 
THERE'S TWO TUBES 
LAST TUBE 
LITTLE BIT MORE FOIL 
AND THEN 
ROLL AWAY 
THERE YOU GO 
WE'LL CUT THOSE ENDS OFF AGAIN 
AND PUSH THOSE IN 
THREE TUBES 
NOW WHAT WE NEED IS STICKY TAPE 
AND START STICKING 
RIGHT 
LITTLE BIT AT THE TOP 
A LITTLE BIT AT THE BOTTOM 
RIGHT 
OH BIT FLOPPY 
LET'S DO THE OTHER SIDE SHALL WE 
A LITTLE BIT AT THE TOP 
AND A LITTLE BIT AT THE BOTTOM 
THERE WE GO 
NOW THAT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK LIKE A ROCKET 
I THINK WE NEED TO PUT A LITTLE TOP ON THERE 
TO DO OUR TOP WE'RE GOING TO NEED OUR BLUE PAPER 
FIRST OF ALL FOLD IT 
THEN FOLD IT AGAIN 
AND THEN ONE MORE FOLD 
AND THEN WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS CUT OFF THE END 
WHAT YOU END UP WITH IS A NICE LITTLE CIRCLE 
WE NEED TO PUT A LITTLE CUT IN HERE 
TO THE MIDDLE OF OUR CIRCLE 
IF I BEND IT IN IT MAKES 
A CONE SHAPE 
IT'S LIKE A LITTLE HAT 
NOW WE NEED TO TAPE THAT TOGETHER 
AND PUT IT ON THE TOP OF OUR ROCKET 
THERE WE GO 
THAT'S A PERFECT FIT 
IT'S LIKE OUR ROCKET'S GOT ITS OWN LITTLE BLUE HAT 
RIGHT 
THERE WE GO 
NOW THE THING THAT'S MISSING NOW 
IS LITTLE WINDOWS FOR SOME ASTRONAUTS TO LOOK OUT INTO DEEPEST SPACE 
I'M GOING TO USE 
THESE LITTLE BLACK SPOTS FOR THAT 
PUT ONE THERE 
ONE HERE 
AND ONE THERE 
I STILL THINK WE'RE MISSING SOMETHING ON OUR ROCKET 
OF COURSE SOME FLAMES SHOOTING OUT OF THE BOTTOM 
AND FOR THAT I'M GOING TO NEED OUR TISSUE PAPER 
I'VE GOT THREE DIFFERENT COLOURS HERE RED YELLOW AND ORANGE 
ALL YOU NEED TO DO WITH THESE IS TO RIP THEM 
IN HALF 
GIVE THEM A LITTLE TWIST 
AND THEN WE CAN PUSH THEM INTO THE BOTTOM OF YOUR ROCKET 
I'LL USE A LITTLE BIT OF TAPE ON THAT JUST SO IT DOESN'T FALL OUT 
WHILE WE'RE FLOATING INTO DEEPEST SPACE 
ANOTHER LITTLE TWIST ON HERE 
AND A BIT OF TAPE 
AND THERE WE GO 
FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE 
ROCKETS DON'T REALLY FLY INDOORS DO THEY 
NO THEY FLOAT INTO SPACE AMONGST THE STARS 
AND SOMETIMES THEY LAND ON THE MOON 
MAYBE WE'LL SEE SOME MORE THINGS IN OUTER SPACE 
THROUGH THE WINDOWS 
HOW MANY WINDOWS 
ONE TWO THREE 
ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED 
WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
IT'S THE ROUND WINDOW 
HAVE YOU EVER LOOKED UP AT THE MOON AND THE STARS 
AND WONDERED WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO FLY UP THERE AMONGST THEM 
MANY YEARS AGO SOME MEN DID MANAGE TO GO TO THE MOON 
THEY BUILT A VERY POWERFUL ROCKET WHICH BLASTED OFF FROM EARTH 
IT TOOK FOUR DAYS TO GET TO THE MOON 
THEY THEN TRAVELLED DOWN TO THE MOON IN A SPECIAL MOON LANDING VEHICLE 
THEIR FIRST STEPS ON THE MOON WERE VERY EXCITING 
THEY FOUND THAT THEY COULD BOUNCE AROUND VERY EASILY 
LOOKS LIKE FUN BUT ACTUALLY THEY WERE VERY VERY BRAVE 
BECAUSE THERE IS NO AIR TO BREATHE ON THE MOON 
THEY HAD TO WEAR SPECIAL SPACESUITS 
NOW WHEN MEN AND WOMEN GO INTO SPACE 
THEY TRAVEL AROUND THE EARTH AND USE A SPACE SHUTTLE 
THAT CAN LAND BACK ON THE EARTH AND BE USED AGAIN 
THESE PEOPLE ARE CALLED ASTRONAUTS 
WHEN THEY ARE IN SPACE THERE IS NOTHING TO HOLD THEM DOWN 
SO THEY FLOAT ABOUT 
EVERYONE WHO'S GONE INTO SPACE HAS SAID THAT 
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OBJECT IN THE SKY IS OUR HOME THE EARTH 
RIGHT I'LL JUST PUT THIS OH 
JUSTIN WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
I'M JUST PUTTING THE MOON DOWN HERE LORNA 
OH WHAT ON EARTH 
NO NOT THE EARTH 
THE EARTH'S OVER THERE 
JUSTIN YES SHOW EVERYONE WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO THE ROCKET 
WHAT I'VE DONE IS PUT A STRAW ON THE BACK HERE 
I'VE THREADED IT ONTO SOME GOLD THREAD 
TAMBA IF YOU HOLD THE ROCKET O. K. AND I'LL CHECK THE FLIGHT PATH 
YEP LOOKS O. K. ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE MOON 
YEP I THINK WE'RE NEARLY READY TO LAUNCH 
O. K. ARE WE READY TO LAUNCH TIKKABILLA ONE 
THIS IS TIKKABILLA HOUSE TO TIKKABILLA ROCKET 
LAUNCH PLEASE START THE COUNTDOWN TEN NINE 
EIGHT SEVEN SIX 
FIVE FOUR 
THREE TWO ONE 
BLAST OFF 
THE TIKKABILLA ONE HAS REACHED THE MOON 
THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE TIKKABILLA CLOCK 
LET'S LAUNCH AND FIND OUT WHAT TIME IT IS 
TIKKABILLA TOCKABILLA 
TIKKABILLA TOCK 
WHAT'S THE TIME 
ON THE TIKKABILLA CLOCK 
WELL THE LONG HAND IS POINTING TO THE NUMBER THREE 
SO THAT MEANS IT'S A QUARTER PAST SOMETHING 
AND THE SHORT HAND IS POINTING JUST PAST THE NUMBER FOUR 
SO THAT MEANS IT'S A QUARTER PAST FOUR 
BUT WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE CLOCK 
WOW IT'S ANOTHER ROCKET 
THIS IS SAMI 
HE LIVES WITH HIS MUM AND DAD HIS SISTER ANUJA AND HIS GRANDAD SONNY 
SAMI IS FOUR AND A HALF YEARS OLD 
AND SAMI LOVES TO DAYDREAM 
IT WAS TUESDAY AND SAMI AND HIS MOTHER WERE OUT SHOPPING 
THEY HADN'T GONE VERY FAR BEFORE THEY RAN INTO AUNTIE ROSIE 
AUNTIE ROSIE LOVED TO TALK 
AND WHILE SHE AND SAMI'S MOTHER CHATTED 
SAMI WENT TO LOOK AT THE TOYS IN THE TOYSHOP WINDOW 
THERE WERE ROCKETS AND ROBOTS SPACESHIPS AND MOON BUGGIES 
REMOTE CONTROLLED DOGS AND TELESCOPES 
AND OTHER THINGS HE DIDN'T RECOGNISE BUT WHICH LOOKED VERY EXCITING 
AS SAMI LOOKED HE SAW THE REFLECTION 
OF A HUGE SPACESHIP IN THE WINDOW 
IT WAS A BIT DENTED AND BURNT 
AND IT WAS COMING DOWN TO LAND BEHIND HIM IN THE ROAD 
A WINDOW OPENED IN THE SIDE OF THE SHIP 
AND A SPACEMAN LOOKED OUT AND WAVED 
HI I WAS WONDERING IF YOU'D BE ABLE TO HELP ME 
I WAS TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON BUT MY SHIP'S ALL OUT OF JUICE 
JUICE SAID SAMI WHAT KIND OF JUICE 
ORANGE JUICE SAID THE SPACEMAN TO POWER MY ROCKET 
KNOW WHERE COULD I GET SOME 
WAIT A MINUTE SAID SAMI AND FUMBLED IN THE BOTTOM OF HIS BAG 
HE PULLED OUT AN ORANGE 
WILL THIS HELP YES SAID THE SPACEMAN 
COME I'LL SHOW YOU AROUND 
HE LOWERED A ROPE LADDER FOR SAMI 
WHO CLIMBED CAREFULLY UP WITH HIS ORANGE WOW SAID SAMI 
THIS HERE'S THE HOT SEAT SAID THE SPACEMAN 
AND THIS IS ARMSTRONG THE SHIP'S CAT 
THIS BUTTON FIRES THE ROCKET FOR TAKE OFF 
YOU DON'T WANT TO PUSH THAT ONE BY MISTAKE 
AND THIS IS THE FUEL INJECTION SYSTEM 
AS YOU CAN SEE WE ARE A LITTLE BIT LOW ON JUICE 
CAN I HAVE THAT ORANGE OF YOURS THERE PLEASE 
SAMI HANDED OVER HIS ORANGE 
AND THE SPACEMAN FED IT INTO THE JUICE EXTRACTING MECHANISM 
ARMSTRONG FIRE US UP CALLED THE SPACEMAN 
IT'S NO GOOD HE SAID 
I'M AFRAID WE'RE GOING TO NEED MORE THAN THAT 
OH DEAR SAID SAMI WONDERING WHAT TO DO 
AND THEN HE HAD A THOUGHT 
I'VE GOT A BIT OF POCKET MONEY LEFT 
THIS SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO BUY YOU A FEW MORE ORANGES 
SAMI SCRAMBLED DOWN THE ROPE LADDER AND RAN TO THE GREENGROCER'S 
HIS MOTHER AND AUNTIE ROSIE WERE SO BUSY CHATTING 
THEY HADN'T NOTICED THE SPACESHIP 
AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE SAMI RUNNING PAST 
HE BOUGHT TWELVE ORANGES FROM THE GREENGROCER'S 
AND RAN BACK TO THE SPACESHIP AS FAST AS HE COULD 
SAMI GAVE THE SPACEMAN THE ORANGES 
THAT SHOULD DO IT SAID THE SPACEMAN 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
HE DROPPED THE ORANGES ONE BY ONE INTO THE FUEL INJECTION SYSTEM 
AND THE TANK SLOWLY BEGAN TO FILL UP 
O. K. ARMSTRONG TRY HER NOW 
THAT'S DONE IT SAID THE SPACEMAN 
START THE COUNTDOWN ARMSTRONG WE'RE READY FOR OFF 
I'D BETTER GO NOW SAID SAMI OR MUM WILL BE WONDERING WHERE I AM 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP SAID THE SPACEMAN 
ARMSTRONG AND I ARE VERY GRATEFUL 
SAMI SAID HIS GOODBYES AND CLAMBERED BACK DOWN TO THE PAVEMENT 
HE STOOD BACK AS THE ROCKETS FIRED 
AND THE SPACESHIP BLASTED OFF INTO THE SKY 
AS IT FLEW OVER HIM 
HE COULD SEE THE SPACEMAN AND ARMSTRONG WAVING FROM THE WINDOW 
SAMI CALLED HIS MOTHER COME ON IT'S TIME TO GO 
M. M. M. YOU SMELL OF ORANGES SHE SAID 
AS THEY WALKED OFF DOWN THE STREET TO FINISH THE SHOPPING 
DO YOU THINK THE SPACEMAN GOT UP TO THE MOON AND FLEW AMONG THE STARS 
I'M SURE HE DID TAMBA 
OH I'D LOVE TO FLY AMONG THE STARS 
TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR 
HOW I WONDER WHAT YOU ARE 
UP ABOVE THE WORLD SO HIGH 
LIKE A DIAMOND IN THE SKY 
TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR 
HOW I WONDER WHAT YOU ARE 
WHEN THE BLAZING SUN HAS GONE 
WHEN HE NOTHING SHINES UPON 
THEN YOU SHOW YOUR LITTLE LIGHT
