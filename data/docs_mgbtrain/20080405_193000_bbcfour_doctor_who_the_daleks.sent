WELL I SUGGEST BEFORE WE GO OUTSIDE AND EXPLORE LET US CLEAN OURSELVES UP YES 
WHAT DOES THE RADIATION READ SUSAN 
IT'S READING NORMAL GRANDFATHER 
THERE'S BEEN A FOREST FIRE 
EVERYTHING IS SORT OF WHITE AND ASHY 
A FUNNY MIST THE HEAT MUST HAVE BEEN INDESCRIBABLE 
LOOK AT THE SOIL HERE 
LOOK AT IT IT'S ALL TURNED TO SAND AND ASHES 
EXTRAORDINARY 
HOW CAN SHRUBS OR TREES GROW IN SOIL LIKE THAT H. M. M. 
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S STRANGE 
THERE'S QUITE A BREEZE BLOWING 
WELL LOOK AT THE BRANCHES AND THINGS 
THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE MOVING THEY'RE NOT 
THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY STILL 
OH 
LIKE STONE LOOK 
VERY BRITTLE STONE 
IT CRUMBLES WHEN YOU TOUCH IT LOOK 
IT'S PETRIFIED HOW FASCINATING 
A PETRIFIED JUNGLE 
EXTRAORDINARY 
YES I MUST REALLY INVESTIGATE THAT 
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN HEAT THEN 
WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED IT GRANDFATHER I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW BUT I INTEND TO FIND OUT 
WELL I'M COMING TOO 
IAN WHERE ARE WE I DON'T KNOW 
WHY DOESN'T HE TAKE US BACK 
I'M NOT SURE THAT HE CAN 
WHAT EVER 
I HATE IT AS MUCH AS YOU 
I'M JUST AS AFRAID BUT WHAT CAN WE DO 
WELL WE CAN AT LEAST STAY NEAR THE SHIP 
THE SHIP'S NO GOOD WITHOUT HIM WE BETTER KEEP AN EYE ON HIM 
HE SEEMS TO HAVE A KNACK OF GETTING HIMSELF INTO TROUBLE 
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY DANGER NOT NECESSARILY 
BUT DON'T BE TOO COMPLACENT 
YOU'RE RIGHT I SUPPOSE 
I JUST WISH IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT YES 
WELL I SUPPOSE WE'D BETTER MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T FALL DOWN AND BREAK A LEG 
DON'T YOU EVER THINK HE DESERVES SOMETHING TO HAPPEN TO HIM 
YES 
OH GRANDFATHER LOOK 
IT'S A FLOWER A PERFECT FLOWER 
IT'S EVEN KEPT SOME OF ITS COLOURS 
YES VERY PRETTY VERY PRETTY 
LOOK LOOK WHAT I'VE FOUND 
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL ISN'T IT I'M GOING TO TRY AND PICK IT AND KEEP IT IN ONE PIECE 
BE CAREFUL IT'LL BE VERY FRAGILE OH 
THERE WE ARE 
BEAUTIFUL 
WHEN I GET IT BACK TO THE SHIP IAN IAN 
COMING COMING 
WHAT IS IT WHAT'S THE MATTER 
NO 
OH IT'S ALL RIGHT 
LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THIS PLACE IT'S SOLID STONE IT'S HIDEOUS 
YES IT IS 
IT'S ALSO SIGNIFICANT 
NOTHING ON EARTH COULD LOOK LIKE THIS IT LOOKS LIKE SOME SCULPTURED NIGHTMARE 
IT'S CERTAINLY ALIEN TO ANYTHING ON YOUR PLANET 
BUT YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT ONE THING THIS ISN'T LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE 
THE ANIMAL IS SOLIDIFIED CERTAINLY BUT IT'S NOT CRUMBLY STONE 
IT'S METAL 
YES IT ALWAYS WAS 
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE 
WHY CAN'T YOU IMAGINE AN ANIMAL UNLESS IT'S FLESH BLOOD AND BONE 
NO I TELL YOU THIS IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FORMATION 
I SHOULD SAY ORIGINALLY IT WAS SOME PLIABLE METAL 
HELD TOGETHER BY A MAGNETIC FIELD OR IN A MAGNETIC FIELD RATHER 
IT MAY HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO ATTRACT ITS VICTIMS TOWARDS IT IF THEY WERE OF METAL TOO 
WE'RE NOT ON EARTH THEN NO CERTAINLY NOT 
ARE YOU SURE I'M CERTAIN 
YOU NEEDN'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT YOUNG MAN 
WE STARTED THIS JOURNEY FAR TOO HURRIEDLY TO MAKE ANY CALCULATIONS 
YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL AS I DO 
HOWEVER WE'RE ALIVE 
GRANDFATHER LOOK THE JUNGLE ENDS OVER THERE 
TRY NOT TO BE TOO UPSET 
I COUNTED SO MUCH ON JUST GOING BACK 
TO THINGS I RECOGNISE AND TRUST 
BUT HERE THERE'S NOTHING TOO RELY ON NOTHING 
WELL THERE'S ME 
BARBARA ALL I ASK YOU TO DO IS BELIEVE REALLY BELIEVE WE'LL GO BACK 
WE WILL YOU KNOW 
I WISH I WAS MORE LIKE YOU 
I'M AFRAID I'M A VERY UNWILLING ADVENTURER 
I'M NOT EXACTLY REVELLING IN IT MYSELF 
GRANDFATHER'S TALKING ABOUT FIXING OUR POSITION BY THE STARS 
GOOD WHERE IS HE JUST OVER THERE 
SUSAN DON'T YOU HAVE ANYTHING IN THE SHIP THAT RECORDS THE JOURNEYS 
OH YES THERE'S A METER FIXED TO A GREAT BIG BANK OF COMPUTERS 
IF YOU FEED IT WITH THE RIGHT SORT OF INFORMATION IT CAN DELIVER YOU TO ANY PLACE YOU WANT TO GO 
THEN WHY DON'T WE KNOW WHERE WE ARE 
IT'S A QUESTION OF THE RIGHT INFORMATION YOU SEE 
I DON'T SAY THAT GRANDFATHER DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO WORK THE SHIP BUT HE'S SO FORGETFUL 
AND HE WILL GO OFF AND 
WELL HE LIKES TO WORK ON HIS OWN 
SO I'VE NOTICED 
ANYWAY HE HAS ONLY GOT TO GO AND DO SOME COMPUTATIONS BACK IN THE SHIP AND WE CAN MOVE ON 
WELL IT CAN'T BE TOO SOON FOR ME 
WELL NOW ARE WE READY 
DOCTOR HAVE YOU WORKED OUT YET HOW ALL THIS HAPPENED 
NO NOT REALLY NOT REALLY 
WHATEVER IT WAS DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT WAS LIVING BUT THE PLANET IS DEAD 
TOTALLY DEAD 
BARBARA DOCTOR OVER HERE 
WHAT IS IT CHESTERTON 
WE REALLY MUST GET BACK 
IT'S FASCINATING 
A CITY A HUGE CITY 
WELL DOCTOR CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING ANY SIGN OF LIFE 
NO NO SIGN OF LIFE 
JUST BUILDINGS MAGNIFICENT BUILDINGS 
LET ME HAVE A LOOK 
FABULOUS HERE YOU HAVE A LOOK 
WHAT DO YOU THINK DOCTOR I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW 
WHATEVER IT WAS THAT DESTROYED THE VEGETATION HERE CERTAINLY HASN'T DAMAGED THE CITY 
BUT THERE'S JUST NO SIGN OF LIFE NO MOVEMENT NO LIGHT 
NO NO I SHALL KNOW MORE ABOUT IT WHEN I'VE BEEN DOWN THERE 
DOWN THERE OH NO 
WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE SHIP DON'T BE RIDICULOUS 
THAT CITY DOWN THERE IS A MAGNIFICENT SUBJECT FOR STUDY 
AND I INTEND TO THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE IT 
IT'S TOO LATE TO TALK ABOUT IT NOW IT'S GETTING DARK 
WE'LL DISCUSS IT WHEN WE GET BACK TO THE SHIP 
YES IT'S TOO LATE TO GET DOWN THERE NOW 
ALL RIGHT THEN BUT I ASSURE YOU I'M DETERMINED TO STUDY THAT PLACE 
DO WHAT YOU LIKE AS LONG AS YOU DON'T ENDANGER THE REST OF US 
VERY WELL THEN I SHALL LOOK AT IT MYSELF ALONE 
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN OPERATE THE SHIP 
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT DOCTOR 
YOUR GLASSES 
I THINK THIS IS THE WAY WE CAME 
WHO'S THERE 
ARGH 
IT'S ALL RIGHT SUSAN IT'S ALL RIGHT 
YOU'RE SAFE NOW 
DID SUSAN TELL YOU WHAT FRIGHTENED HER 
SHE'S CONVINCED THAT SOMEONE TOUCHED HER AND I TRIED TO MAKE HER SEE IT WASN'T POSSIBLE 
I'M AFRAID SHE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME 
I WONDER ER WOULD YOU HAVE A TALK WITH HER 
YES OF COURSE I WILL YES SOMETIMES I FIND THE GULF 
BETWEEN SUSAN'S AGE AND MINE MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND 
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO OH WOULD YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M GRATEFUL 
HELLO

BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE WHO IT WAS 
NO 
IT WAS A TOUCH ON THE SHOULDER I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN 
I BELIEVE YOU 
BUT GRANDFATHER SAYS THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO LIVE OUT THERE 
SUSAN IT ISN'T THAT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE YOU 
IT'S JUST THAT HE FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO GO AGAINST HIS SCIENTIFIC FACTS 
I KNOW OH LOOK WHY DON'T YOU JUST TRY AND FORGET IT FOR THE MOMENT 
FOR THE MOMENT 
WHAT'S THIS ONE FOR 
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU MAKE SENSE OF ANY OF THIS 
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT 
CAN YOU FIND OUT WHERE WE ARE
