THIS AFTERNOON SHAPES UP 
I'M DELIGHTED TO SAY I'M JOINED BY 
MARK WOODS AND TANNI HOW DOES IT 
FEEL TO BE RETIRED 
IT'S GREAT 
ACTUALLY I HAVE GOT NO REGRETS 
LAST YEAR WAS THE RIGHT TIME FOR ME

EVENTS WHEN YOU ARE COMPETING YOU 
DON'T GET TO SEE ANYTHING ELSE 
IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE AND ENJOYING 
IT

LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HERE WE WE HAVE GOT DAVE ROBERTS NATALIE 
JONES BUT I'M REALLY LOOKING 
FORWARD TO THE NEW TALENT HEATHER 
FREDERIKSEN IS THE ONE TO WATCH 
SOMETIMES THE SWIMMING IS THE MOST 
DIFFICULT ONE TO FOLLOW IN TERMS 
OF CLASS VACATIONS 
YOU HAD TEN 
CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE WITH A VARIOUS 
AMOUNT OF DISABILITY ALSO 
CATEGORIES FOR VISUAL IMPAIRMENT 
IF THERE IS AN ESSAY IN FRONT OF IT 
IT MEANS SWIMMING L. KNOW DURING 
COMMENTARY YOU WOULD EXPLAIN THAT 
MORE 
HOPEFULLY YOU WILL PICK UP A MORE CLASS VACATIONS FROM THAT MARK 
WILL BE BOB POLLARD HE WILL BE 
WITH BOB BOLLARD BRITAIN HAVE GOT 
TWO OF THE BEST IN THE WORLD 
MATTHEW WALKER IS UP AGAINST DAVE 
ROBERTS THE WORLD RECORD HOLDER 
WHO KNOWS EVERY TIME HE SWIMS 
EXPECTATIONS ARE HIGH 
AT THE END 
OF THE DAY I'M A WORLD RECORD 
HOLDER SO THAT COMES WITH PRESSURE 
AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S GOOD TO 
PUT ON A SHOW FOR THE CHILDREN BUT 
SOMETIMES BEING REALISTIC IS MORE 
IMPORTANT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE GOT 
TO STEP BACK FROM IT ALL DO WHAT 
YOU HAVE GOT TO DO SOMETIMES 
THAT'S ENOUGH 
HOW WILL YOU PREPARE 
BETWEEN NOW AND BEIJING 
I WOULD GO 
TO NEW YORK AND TO A TRAINING CAMP 
WHICH WILL BE HORRIBLE I'M SURE 
HOPEFULLY BY THE TIME SIX OR SEVEN 
WEEKS PREVIOUS TO THE GAMES WE 
WILL BE HERE FOR THE YOUTH 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND I SHOULD BE 
SOMETHING PRETTY QUICKLY 
HERE WE 
HAVE A TRUE BATTLE OF BRITAIN 
DAVID ROBERTS THE JOVIAL WELSHMAN 
WHO HAS SET OF THE NEW WORLD RECORD 
IN THE FIFTY METRE FREESTYLE HERE IS 
THE MAN WHO USED TO HOLD THAT 
RECORD MATTHEW WALKER QUITE A 
BATTLE BETWEEN THESE TWO THEY ARE 
GOOD FRIENDS OUTSIDE THE SWIMMING 
POOL THE WILL WE ANOTHER RECORD WILL WE SEE ANOTHER WORLD RECORD 
ONE LENGTH OF THE COMMONWEALTH POLE 
TWENTY SEVEN POINT SIX SEVEN THE NEW WORLD RECORD SET BY 
DAVE ROBERTS LAST MONTH DAVID 
MORE ENDURANCE MATTHEW HAS ALREADY 
LOST HIS LEAD AND DAVID ROBERTS IS 
COMING THROUGH IT'S A REAL SPLASH 
AND DAVID ROBERTS SO STRONG 
THIS IS DAVE ROBERTS BY A WHOLE 
BODY LENGTH TO WIN THIS ONE IT'S 
NOT A WORLD RECORD NOT AS QUICK AS 
LAST MONTH BUT VERY IMPRESSIVE 
MATTHEW WALKER UNABLE TO STICK THE 
PACE IN THIRD STRONGER ALL THE 
WAY THROUGH TO THE END AND HE 
NAILED THIS FINISH AGAIN SHE IS 
CONFIRMATION OF WHAT HE HAS JUST 
ACHIEVED HERE IS CONFIRMATION OF 
WHAT HE HAS JUST ACHIEVED 
I KNOW YOU SET VERY HIGH STANDARDS 
HOW DOES THIS RANK 
IT'S THE 
QUICKEST AT WHO HAS EVER SWUM IT 
BUT IT IS THE QUICKEST I HAVE NEVER 
SAW MUCH AND I'M THE ONLY PERSON 
WHO HAS DONE THAT 
ARE YOU COPING 
WITH THE PRESSURE 
I DON'T FEEL 
PRESSURE I DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT L. 
ENJOY WHAT I DO AND THAT'S THE BEST 
THING ABOUT IT 
WE HAVE GOT ANOTHER 
AUSTRALIAN AND GREAT BRITAIN CLASH 
ALONGSIDE HER THE FASTEST SWIMMER 
IN LANE FOUR ALL OF THESE SWIMMERS HAVE GOT A 
VISUAL IMPAIRMENT THEY HAVE A FEW 
BITS OF VISION THEY SHOULD BE ABLE 
TO SPOT THE TERM WELL IT WILL BE A 
VERY TOUGH RACE BETWEEN THESE TWO 
A GOOD START BY A HENRY BEING 
CHEERED ON BY THE HOME SUPPORTERS 
A STRONG A SWIM RIYADH AND HAS 
BEEN AWAY IN HENRY BY ALMOST A SECOND AFTER THE TERM THIS GIVES YOU AN IDEA WHAT 
DISABLED SWIMMING IS LIKE IN THE U. K. 
IT IS POSITIVE UP FRONT AND GOING 
FOR BREAK HENRY HAS HAD A 
FANTASTIC RACE CAN SHE HOLD ON 
SHE IS REALLY COMING OF AGE THIS 
YEAR FANTASTIC NEWS FOR THE 
BRITISH TEAM THE BEST TIME EVER FOR HENRY LOOK 
AT THE MARGIN BETWEEN FIRST AND 
SECOND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX SECONDS BUT THE GREAT BRITISH RECORD SHE 
IS DOING A LOT OF WORK NOW AND HAS 
BEEN BEATEN BY A PRUE ON SEVERAL 
OCCASIONS NOW SHE IS LOOKING TO 
WIN SHE DIDN'T FADE AWAY AT ALL 
SHE COMES UP TO THE LAST FIVE 
METRES WORKING VERY VERY HARD 
SHE COULD HAVE GOT A TIGHTER FINISH 
BUT YOU CAN'T BEGRUDGE HER THAT 
GOOD TO SEE HER ON TOP AGAIN 
A NEW PERSONAL BEST FOR HER A NEW BRITISH RECORD HOW DOES THAT FEEL 
GREAT L. WAS QUITE A BIT FEEL SLOWER YESTERDAY BUT IT WAS A 
SOLID SWIM BUT I WANT TO GET AS 
CLOSE TO MY RECORD AS I DID TONIGHT 
AND I BROKERED WHICH IS A BIG 
SHOCK REALLY 
THERE IS THE WORLD 
RECORD HOLDER FOR THE MEN'S FIFTY 
METRE FREESTYLE AND THE MANNER 
BLOCKING HIS PATH IS THE EUROPEAN 
RECORD HOLDER IN THE FOREGROUND 
JAMES ANDERSON FROM SCOTLAND DIFFERING STARTS THERE JAMES HAS 
GOT MORE STRENGTHS IN HIS LEGS AND 
I THINK HE'S GOING TO BE TOO 
POWERFUL FOR CURTIS HE HAS BEATEN 
HIM IN RECENT YEARS IT HAS BEEN A 
LONG TIME SINCE CURTIS WAS NEAR HIS 
WORLD RECORD TIME AND ALREADY HE IS 
OUT OF THE RACE REALLY LET'S SEE 
WHAT JIM CAN DO THAT TIME HAS BEEN 
ON THE BOX FOR SOME TIME QUITE NOW 
SIXTY POINT ONE ONE ONE OF FIVE HUNDRED FOURTEEN HE IS 
DOMINATING THE RACE HE IS A LONG 
LONG WAY BACK THIS IS ALL ABOUT 
JAMES ANDERSON AGAINST THE CLOCK 
THAT'S RIGHT THIS IS ONE OF HIS 
FAVOURED EVENTS HE LOOKED VERY 
SERIOUS BEFORE THE START OF THE 
RACE VERY FOCUSED HE IS GOING TO 
TRY AND GET TO THE EUROPEAN BRITISH 
RECORD OF SIXTY FIVE 
HE IS WORKING HARD 
AND HE WILL BE OUTSIDE IT THOUGH 
VERY POSITIVE FINISH BY JAMES WELL 
DONE JIM FIRST PLACE TO HIM KIT 
IS LOVEJOY IT HAS NOT GOT THE PACE 
HE USED TO HAVE CURTIS LOVEJOY 
HAS NOT GOT THE PACE HE USED TO 
HAVE 
NEXT UP THE WOMEN'S TWO HUNDRED METRES 
INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY EVENT IN THIS 
EVENT BRITAIN HAS AN EMBARRASSMENT 
OF RICHES THREE OF THE TOP WOMEN 
IN THE WORLD NATALIE JONES IS THE 
WORLD CHAMPION AND WORLD RECORD 
HOLDER BUT WITH LIZ JOHNSON AND 
OTHERS IN THE RACE SHE WILL FACE 
OPPOSITION 
THE MEDLEY IS NATALIE'S OPPOSITION EVENT WHEN WE DO RACE IT'S GOOD 
BUT WE HAVE OUR INDIVIDUALS AS WELL 
WE HAD A BIT OF A BETTER AT THE 
START OF THE RACE WHETHER WE ARE 
GOING TO GET ONE TWO OR THREE WE 
HAVE GOT OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL EVENTS 
SO IT'S LIKE BIT OF GET 
TOGETHER IF THAT MAKES SENSE WE WE HAVE RACED EACH OTHER SIX TIMES IN 
THE LAST THREE WEEKS BUT WE KNOW 
WHAT TO EXPECT FROM EACH OTHER BUT 
IT PUSHES US ON 
I SUPPOSE THEIR 
EXPECTATIONS FOR BEIJING ARE HIGH 
DEFINITELY PILING THE PRESSURE ON 
MYSELF MORE THAN ANYTHING AM 
RANKED NO ONE GOING INTO IT SO IT'S 
DEFINITELY GOING TO BE AN 
INTERESTING RACE AN INTERESTING 
PARALYMPIC GAMES TWO HUNDRED METRES INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY FOR 
THE S. M. SIX CATEGORY WOMEN JONES 
LEWIS AND JOHNSON WE ARE LOOKING 
HERE AT THERE ARE SUCH GREAT DEPTH 
IN THIS EVENT IN THE TOP FIVE IN 
THE WORLD FOUR OF THEM ARE BRITISH 
SUMMERS ELEANOR SWIMMING'S 
SIMMONS MAY DROP ONE OF THESE THREE 
BRITISH SWIMMERS OUT THE CHINESE 
SWIMMER IS GOING VERY WELL INDEED 
WE WILL GET AN IDEA OF WHAT THEY 
GAP IS AT THE TURNER BY OUR 
CHANGING STROKES NOW THE CHINESE 
SWIMMER IS LEAVING NOW THEY ARE 
CHANGING STROKES NOW THE CHINESE 
SWIMMER IS A LEADING NOW THIS IS 
VERY VERY FAST THIS IS WAY WAY 
INSIDE THE WORLD RECORD SPLIT THAT 
NATALIE JONES DID WHEN SHE SET THE 
WORLD'S RECORD TWO YEARS AGO THIS 
COULD BE A VERY FAST TIME BY THE 
CHINESE THIS SHOWS EXACTLY WHAT 
THEY ARE MADE OF AT THE OLYMPICS IN 
A FEW MONTHS' TIME THIS IS A VERY 
IMPORTANT EVENT AND THE CHINESE ARE 
LEADING BY A LONG WAY THIS IS A HUGE LEAD YOU WILL 
EXPECT THE BRITS TO COME BACK THEY 
WILL BE SLIGHTLY STRONGER ON THE 
BREAST STROKE BUT THEY MIGHT HAVE 
LEFT IT TOO LATE 
LOOK AT THAT THE 
CHINESE SWIMMER IS IN THE LEAD AND 
MAY WELL LEAD FROM START TO FINISH 
IT IS LOOKING AT WAY IT REALLY IS 
YOU BEGIN TO WONDER WHETHER THE 
BRITS HAVE ALMOST TAKEN THEIR EYE 
OFF THE BALL THEY HAVE DOMINATED 
THIS EVENT FOR SO LONG AND NOW 
SUDDENLY OUT OF THE BLUE WE HAVE 
ANOTHER SWIMMER AND SHE HAS 
ABSOLUTELY BLOWN THEM AWAY I I WONDER IF THE EUROPEAN RECORD IS 
UNDER THREAT THERE IS A LOT OF 
GROUND TO MAKE UP FOR THE BRITS 
THE CHINESE WHO WENT OUT STRONGLY 
IN THE BUTTERFLY DID WELL ON THE 
BREASTSTROKE YOU CAN VISIBLY SEE 
THE GAP NOW BETWEEN FIRST AND 
SECOND LATAPY JONES HAS A LOT OF 
WORK TO DO NATALIE JONES HAS A 
LOT OF WORK TO DO TO GET BACK INTO 
GOLD MEDAL POSITION 
THIS IS THREE 
SECONDS INSIDE THE WORLD RECORD 
SPLIT NATALIE IS KNOWN FOR HER 
STRONG FREESTYLE FINISH ALL THE 
BRITISH GIRLS ARE COMING BACK IF IF IT IS GOING TO BE AN EXCEPTIONAL 
FINISH MAYBE THE CHINESE GOT TOO 
MUCH INTO THE RACE TOO EARLY IT 
IS GOING TO BE HERE COMES LEWIS 
AND THE CHINESE IS BEING OVERHAULED 
LOOK AT THE AFFECT GOING IN FROM 
THAT TO THE JONES IN LANE FOUR SHE 
IS NOW ACTUALLY IN FRONT AND THE 
CHINESE MAY WELL FINISH IN THIRD 
HERE COMES LEWIS AS WELL WHAT AN 
EFFORT TO GET BACK INTO THE RACE 
MAYBE NOT EVEN A MEDAL FOR THE 
CHINESE AND FACT SHE GETS EDGED 
OUT BY THE AMERICAN THE CHINESE PUT TOO MUCH IN IN THE 
EARLY STAGES AND HAD NOTHING LEFT 
AT THE END 
THE IS IS PROBABLY THE 
TOUGHEST RACE NATALIE JONES HAS HAD 
TO SWIM IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS 
THIS IS A SUPERB TIME FROM BOTH 
THE BRITISH SWIMMERS IT BODES SO 
WELL FOR THE GAMES IN BEIJING 
IN THE END THE CHINESE MISS OUT IN 
FOURTH PLACE 
YOU ARE ALL SMILES NOW BUT WHAT A 
RACE 
YES IT WAS AMAZING L. DID RACE NOT EXPECT IT AT ALL L. L. A AM WELSH 
HAVE TO SAY THE LEAST 
IT LOOKED 
TOUGH FOR A MOMENT FOR STUCK YES I 
HAD TO CLAW MY WAY BACK ON THE 
FREESTYLE 
IT LOOKED TOUGH FOR A FREESTYLE MOMENT 
YOU ARE IN A RICH VEIN OF MOMENT FORM I YOU GOING TO KEEP THAT 
GOING TO SEPTEMBER HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY FINGERS CROSSED L. L. AM TRAINING 
REALLY WELL AT THE MOMENT IT 
SHOULD BE ALL GOOD AND HAD SO THE 
I WILL GET ANOTHER WORLD RECORD AT 
BEIJING 
WELL DONE 
THANK YOU BEIJING SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THE FUTURE OF 
BRITISH SWIMMING CERTAINLY ONE OF 
THAT EMERGING BRITISH SIMMERS 
THE EMERGING BRITISH SWIMMERS AWAY AT THE START VERY STRONGLY 
LYTHAM'S TIME IS SLIGHTLY FASTER 
THAN FREDERICKS AND'S LATHAM 
FREDERIC SEN'S SHE SUSTAINED AN INJURY SWIMMING IN 
OPEN WATER SHE IS PULLING AWAY 
INCREDIBLY HAIR 
EARLIER IN APRIL 
SHE EQUALLED THE WORLD RECORD SET 
IN SYDNEY IN TWO THOUSAND LOOK AT THE GAP 
ALREADY BOTH TO BOTH THESE SWIMMERS LOOK 
LIKE THEY MAY BE LONG NOBODY IS 
ANYWHERE NEAR HER THERE IT COULD 
BE QUITE EXCEPTIONAL FROM THE 
SWIMMER IN LANE FOUR 
SHE IS 
STORMING THROUGH THIS FIELD NOT 
EVEN LOOKING BACK SHE DOESN'T EVEN 
NEED TO BECAUSE SHE HAS FIVE METRES 
CLEAR OF EVERYBODY ELSE IT IS ALL 
ABOUT THIS WOMEN IN LANE FOUR SHE 
IS GOING TO COME IN WITH A TIME IT 
IS A NEW WORLD RECORD SHE HAS 
BEATEN THE 
WHOLE SHE HAS BEATEN THE PREVIOUS RECORD BY A WHOLE SECOND 
THAT IS ALL TO 
AWESOME SHE BEAT JESSICA LONG IF 
THAT SYSTEM AS CAN BE THE AMERICANS 
IT IS ALMOST LIKE A SIX POINT 
DIFFERENCE POWERING ALL THE WAY 
THROUGH TO THE END NOT FINISHING 
NOT SLOWING DOWN AT ALL A WORLD 
RECORD SWIM AN AWESOME JOB THERE 
BY HEATHER 
WAS THAT EXPECTED 
NOT AT ALL I 
MANAGED TO EQUAL MY WORLD RECORD 
BUT MY BACK HAS NOT BEEN FEELING 
GREAT I WAS VERY GOING INTO THIS 
TONIGHT BUT TO BRING OUT THAT TIME 
IS ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE REALLY 
PLEASED WITH THAT GOOD 
THAT WAS 
THAT PUTS YOU IN POLE POSITION FOR 
BEIJING 
YES IT IS GOING TO BE BEIJING GREAT STUFF IT IS GOING TO BE 
QUITE DAUNTING AND SCARY BUT AT 
THE SAME TIME IT IS GOING TO BE 
REALLY EXCITING AND I THINK I CAN 
GET THE ADRENALIN UP AND HAVE IT 
REALLY REALLY A NEW WORLD RECORD FOR HEATHER 
WELL SOME GREAT RACES SO FAR FROM 
THE PULL WE WILL BE BACK HERE FOR 
MORE ACTION LATER BUT FOR NOW WE 
ARE GOING TO TURN OUR ATTENTION TO 
WHEELCHAIR BASKETBALL THE MEN'S 
AND WOMEN'S TEAM HAVE BOTH BEEN IN 
ACTION WE ARE GOING TO BEGIN WITH 
THE WOMEN COURTSIDE IT IS RONALD 
MCINTOSH MCINTOSH WELCOME TO THE REGIONAL INDOOR 
ARENA WHICH LIES AT THE HEART OF 
MANCHESTER SPORT CITY FOR THE PAST 
FOUR DAYS IT HAS BEEN THE SPEED 
MERCHANTS OF THE HARD WOULD THAT 
HAVE BEEN STRUTTING THEIR STUFF OUT 
ON THE COURT AT THIS BASKETBALL 
TOURNAMENT WELL I AM DELIGHTED TO 
SAY THAT JOINING US TO DISCUSS THE 
PROCEEDINGS HERE AND CHAMPIONSHIP 
DAY AS THE PLAYERS ARE WARMING UP 
HIS THE WINNER OF THE INAUGURAL 
PARALYMPIC WORLD CUP IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE BUT 
NOW LONG RETIRED AND WATCHING FROM 
THE CONFINES OF THE COMMENTARY BOX 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS 
TOURNAMENT IS NOW A REGULAR FIXTURE 
ON THE INTERNATIONAL CALENDAR BUT 
HOW MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANCE WILL IT 
ASSUME IN THE PARALYMPIC YEAR EACH EACH YEAR IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE 
IMPORTANT IT IS CRUCIAL THIS YEAR 
IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE TEAMS 
TO GAUGE THE OPPOSITION A 
SPECIALLY FOR THE G. B. WOMEN BECAUSE 
BRAZIL ARE IN THEIR GRIP IT IS A 
CHANCE FOR THEM TO WORK ON THE 
TACTICS IN A PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE 
BEEN 
PRACTISING ALL 
SEASON LONG 
YOU CAN TRAIN 
AS LONG WANT 
IN THE GYM BUT NOTHING BEATS WILL 
CUT THROAT COMPETITION 
UP WE CAN SEE HOW THE TEAMS GOT TO 
THIS STAGE IT FOLLOWED ROUND 
ROBIN FORMAT FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS 
TEAM G. B. PERFORMED FAIRLY WELL 
WINNING TWO WHILE LOSING TO THE 
DUTCH THEY FACE THE BRAZILIAN SIDE 
WHO HAVE YET TO REGISTER A WIN FOR 
THE BRONZE MEDAL 
HOW DID THE SQUAD GO ABOUT PUTTING 
THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE SEMI 
FINAL LAST AND INSURE THEY COME OUT 
WITH STRONG SPIRIT TO PERFORM TODAY 
IT IS A TOUGH ONE IT WAS TODAY DISAPPOINTING YESTERDAY BUT THEY 
HAVE TO PUT THAT ASIDE HAS THAT 
TODAY IS A FRESH GAME THEY HAVE TO 
COME OUT 
WITH INTENSITY 
AND TAKE 
CARE OF 
THE BALL 
THEY HAVE TO 
CREATE HIGH PERCENTAGE SHOTS WHAT 
THEY HAVE TO DO IS FOCUS ON WHAT 
THEY 
NEED TO 
DO TO WIN TODAY AND 
TOTALLY FORGET WHAT HAPPENED 
YESTERDAY THEY CAN LOOK AT AT ON 
VIDEOTAPE ANOTHER DAY 
LET US SEE 
IF THEY CAN MANAGE AND EXECUTE THAT 
BEFORE WE GET TO THE ACTION A 
BRIEF RUN DOWN OF THE RULES 
SIMILAR TO THE RUNNING GAME BUT 
ONE CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE IS THE 
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM HOW DOES THAT WORK IT WORKS ON DISABILITY THE WORK HIGH LEVEL OF DISABILITY THE LOWER 
YOUR POINTS FOR INSTANCE THE 
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM GOES FROM ONE 
TO FORTY FIVE A HIGH POINT THERE WILL 
PROBABLY BE SOMEONE WHO IS A BELOW 
THE KNEE AMPUTEE SAY THEY HAVE 
GREAT BALANCE THERE WILL BE 
CONSIDERED A FORTY FIVE SOMEBODY WITH A 
HIGHER DISABILITY LESS MOBILITY 
SOMEONE PARALYSED FROM THE CHEST 
DOWN WILL BE CLASSED AS ONE 
POINT LEAD YOU ARE ONLY ALLOWED FOURTEEN 
POINTS FOR THE WHOLE TEAM THE 
COACH HAS TO BE MATHEMATICAL GENIUS 
O. K. WE WILL SEE IF WE CAN GENIUS KEEP ABREAST OF THOSE RULES WE 
WILL THINGS OUT AS THE GAME 
PROGRESSES LET US GET TO THE 
ACTION GREAT BRITAIN AGAINST 
BRAZIL FOR THE BRONZE MEDAL NICE OFFENCE FROM THE BRITS THAT TIME 
IF SHE IS HAVING A BIG BIG TIME GAME SHE IS SHE IS AFFECTING 
THE BRAZILIANS FROM ALL POSITIONS 
SHE IS THIS GAME SEEMS TO BE AT BEING 
CALLED 
I DO NOT LIKE THAT ONE CALLED THAT DID NOT SEEM TO BE A FOUL 
TOOMEY AGGRESSIVE BUT FED DEFENCE 
I THOUGHT THERE WAS 
SHE MANAGES TO 
SLICE HER WAY THROUGH AND PUT UP A 
BEAUTIFUL RIGHT HANDED SHOT KISSED 
GENTLY OFF THE GLASS THAT REDUCES 
THE DEFICIT TO EIGHT TWENTY FOUR TO SIXTEEN WITH 
TWO MINUTES REMAINING IN THE FIRST 
HALF 
YOU HAVE TO ADMIRE HER HALF PERSEVERANCE SHE IS STARTING TO 
GET HERSELF INTO IT 
OFFENSIVE FOUL 
UP ON SALLY WAGER THE BALL WILL BE 
END LINE FOR BRAZIL TWO MINUTES 
REMAINING IN THE FIRST HALF 
BRITAIN JUST TRYING TO KEEP HER OUT 
OF THE PROCEEDINGS IT IS AN 
OFFENSIVE FOUL IN THE OTHER 
DIRECTION THAT WAS A GOOD JOB TO 
GET POSITION SALLY DID A GREAT JOB 
THERE FREEMAN IS PLAIN GREAT 
DEFENCE STOPPING THE OTHER SIDE 
FROM GETTING 
THE BALL THAT WAS TOO STRONG REBOUND MARIA THEY JUST PULLED IT BACK SALLY ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE ONE MINUTE 
REMAINING TEN SECONDS REMAINING ON 
THIS SHOT FREEMAN KICKS IT TO 
CAROLINE MACLEAN TOO SHORT IT 
GOES OUT OF BOUNDS FOR BRAZIL GOOD GOOD BALL MOVEMENT BY G. B. BUT THEY DID 
NOT CAPITALISE ON IT THEY COULD 
HAVE GOT THEMSELVES AND EASIER SHOT 
AND A CLOSER ONE A MORE HIGH 
PERCENTAGE SHOT UNDER FIFTY SECONDS REMAINING IN THE 
OPENING HALF NOW MACLEAN IT IS 
INSIDE GOOD HANDS FROM CAROLINE 
MACLEAN JUDGED TO HAVE TOUCHED THE 
ARM AND HAND THERE THAT WILL BE 
ANOTHER FOUL 
IT IS ALWAYS 
DIFFICULT IN THAT SITUATION THERE 
SOMETIMES YOU GO FOR THE BALL BUT 
THE REFEREE ALWAYS SEES IT AS YOU 
CATCHING THE OTHER PERSON'S HAND L. 
THINK THAT WAS A TOUGH CALL MYSELF 
A TEN SECOND DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN 
THE SHOT CLOCK AND THE GAME CLOCK 
TWENTY FIVE SECONDS REMAINING IN THE GAME 
BRAZIL FIRE SHOT BUT AGAIN THE 
REFEREE SEES FOUL 
THE CALL WAS 
FOOTPLATE THERE BASICALLY THE 
CHAIR WAS OUT OF CONTROL AND HER 
FRONT FOOT PLAY ITS TOUCH THE 
GROUND WHICH IS SEEN AS A VIOLATION 
FOOT PLATES 
THIS COULD POSSIBLY 
PROBABLY BE THE FINAL ACTION OF 
THE HALF A BEAUTIFUL PASS HELEN 
FREEMAN FIRES IT UP GETS ANOTHER 
OFFENSIVE ALL SHE IS FOULED A 
GREAT HASSLE BY HELEN FREEMAN THIS 
IS THE PLAYER YOU LIKE THE LOOK OF 
YES HELEN IS A GREAT PLAYER L. AM 
NOT JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE WE 
USED TO PLAY IN THE SAME TEAM I THINK SHE 
HAS A 
HECK OF 
A LOT 
OF 
TALENT 
AND SHE 
IS REALLY GOOD 
FUTURE PROSPECT FOR G. B. AND SHE IS A LEFT HANDER THAT'S ALWAYS TRICKY UNABLE TO CONVERT A BIG REBOUND 
RIGHT ON THE BUZZER THE REFEREE 
SAID IT COUNTS IT WAS JUST BEFORE 
THE BUZZER SOUNDED TEAM GREAT 
BRITAIN CONTINUED TO ASSERT THEIR 
DOMINANCE RUNNING OUT THE EVENTUAL 
WINNER FIFTY SEVEN TO THIRTY FOUR AND TAKING THE 
BRONZE MEDAL 
HOW HELPFUL AS THIS TOURNAMENT 
BEEN 
IT'S FANTASTIC BECAUSE WE BEEN DON'T GET MANY TOURNAMENTS TO GO TO 
THIS IS A GREAT ONE WHICH HAS 
ORGANISED AND WE NEED IS EVERY YEAR 
THE MANCHESTER TOURNAMENT THE THE PERFORMANCE ITSELF TODAY AFTER THE 
DISAPPOINTMENT AGAINST CHINA IN THE 
SEMI FINALS HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO 
PICK UP THE TEAM AND GET THEM TO 
PRODUCE SUCH A STRONG PERFORMANCE 
THEY BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES THEY 
STUCK TO THE GAME PLAN THEY PROVED 
IT IN THE FIRST TWO GAMES WHEN WE 
LOSE AND WE DON'T CONFORM AND WE 
DON'T STICK TO THE GAME PLAN WE 
STRUGGLE THEN WE NEED TO FIND OUT 
WHY WE ARE NOT STICKING TO THE 
GAME PLAN THE NETHERLANDS AGAINST CHINA WAS 
CLOSELY CONTESTED NEITHER TEAM WAS 
ABLE TO ASSERT ANY DOMINANCE ON THE 
GAME 
THE NETHERLANDS DISPLAYED GAME GREAT COMPOSURE AND A COMPOSURE AND 
SHOOTING AND ASSURANCE PROVED TO 
ADD A COMBINATION FOR THE CHINESE 
FIFTY FOUR TO FORTY ONE TO TAKE THE GOLD MEDAL THE NETHERLANDS ARE THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
PARALYMPIC WORLD CUP CHAMPIONS 
GOING UNDEFEATED THROUGHOUT THE 
COURSE OF THE TOURNAMENT AND WERE 
VERY IMPRESSIVE IN SECURING THEIR 
GOLD MEDAL A GREAT PERFORMANCE BY 
THE CHINESE THEY IMPROVED HUGELY 
ON THE INTERNATIONAL BASKETBALL 
SCENE BRONZE FOR THE BRITISH WOMEN 
AND THEY WILL BE LOOKING TO BUILD 
ON THIS PLATFORM HEAD OF THE 
BEIJING OLYMPICS 
WHAT DO THE BRITISH WOMEN NEED TO 
DO TO PROGRESS BETWEEN NOW AND THE 
BEIJING PARALYMPICS IN SEPTEMBER 
WELL THEY FINISHED REALLY WELL IT 
WAS AN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE 
AGAINST THE BRAZILIANS THEY MUST 
PRESS BREAK BUT MUST WORK ON 
GETTING OUT OF THIS BREAK MORE 
POSITIVELY THEY NEED A GOOD BALL 
HANDLER LIKE HELEN FREEMAN AND 
THEY NEED TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE GO 
TO THE BASKET AND MAKE THEIR LAY UP 
MAYBE SOME OF THE GUYS NEED TO WORK 
HARDER IN THE GYM TO BE ABLE TO 
WORK HARDER AGAINST THESE TEAMS 
LOTS TO WORK ON THAT'S THE WOMEN'S 
TOURNAMENT THE JOINERS AT THE 
REGIONAL INDOOR ARENA LATER ON WHEN 
WE WILL BRING YOU THE MEN'S MEDALS 
GAME GAME COMING UP DAVID WEIR GOES FOR GOLD 
AT THE DOUBLE NATALIE DU TOIT 
TALKS ABOUT COMPETING IN THE 
PARALYMPICS AND OLYMPICS AND WE 
HAVE GOT THERE MUST SEE MEN'S 
BASKETBALL COMPETITION WITH BRITAIN 
AIMING TO HEAD THE HEIGHTS THAT'S 
ALL STILL TO COME 
CYCLING NOW AND THIS IS A SPORT 
WHERE BRITAIN HAS HAD PHENOMENAL 
SUCCESS RECENTLY NINE GOLD MEDALS 
AT THE WORLD TRACK CYCLING 
CHAMPIONSHIPS BUT WHAT ABOUT THE 
PARALYMPICS CYCLISTS THEY SEEM TO 
HAVE A WINNING FORMULA HERE IS 
TANNI GREY THOMPSON WITH THE STORY 
FROM THE VELODROME 
SIX WEEKS AGO BRITISH CYCLING 
EXPERIENCE YET ANOTHER GOAL DRESSED 
A RASH AND NOW IT'S THE TURN OF 
THE PARALYMPIC CYCLISTS AHEAD OF 
BEIJING RUSSIA 
BRITISH CYCLING IS SO DOMINANT YOU 
CAN ALMOST GUARANTEE GOALS THE 
BUZZ WORD HERE IS A TALENT 
TRANSFERRED THAT'S TAKING ATHLETES 
FROM ONE SPORT AND BRINGING THEM 
INTO THE VELODROME SARAH STOREY 
BECAME ONE OF THE FIRST CONVERTS IN 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE ARE FROM A SWIMMING SHE HAS 
HAD TWO TITLE SINCE THEN SHE HAS 
GOT NO REGRETS ABOUT MAKING THE 
SWITCH 
THEY HAVE GOT THIS ETHOS SWITCH WHERE THEY LOOK AFTER YOU 
INCREDIBLY WELL AND EVERY MEMBER OF 
THE TEAM IS WORKING FOR YOU ALL THE 
TIME TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE BEST 
OPPORTUNITY TO PERFORM TWO OR 
ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM ALL THE TIME 
HAVING THAT SUPPORT IN MANCHESTER 
AT THE HOME OF BRITISH CYCLING AND 
YOU REALLY DO FEEL AT HOME SIMON SIMON JACKSON IS THE LATEST CONVERT THE 
JUDO CHAMPION HAS BEEN CYCLING FOR 
FIVE WEEKS HE HAS BEEN IMPRESSING 
THE REST OF THE TEAM WITH HIS TIME 
AND RAZOR SHARP WIT 
I LIKE THE 
TIDE CLOTHES AND SHAVED LEG THING 
IT'S RIGHT UP MY STREET L. MUST PAY 
A LOT OF RESPECTS TO BERNARD WE 
HAVE HAD A CRASH COURSE IT IS A 
POWER SPORT AND JUDO IS ABOUT 
EXPLOSION AND SPEED AND POWER IT 
LENDS ITSELF REALLY WELL TO CYCLING 
DO YOU MISS JUDO 
IF YOU ASKED ME 
THREE WEEKS AGO I WOULD SAY YES 
I PROBABLY PUT MY FIANCEE SARAH 
THROUGH HELL IN THE LAST COUPLE OF 
YEARS I HAVE FOUND SOMETHING ELSE 
I ENJOY THIS IS MY NEW HOME THE 
VELODROME I WANT A MUDDLE HIS HIS BIGGEST RIVAL IS HIS OWN TEAM MATES 
AND THE KNEECAPS I WANT A MEDAL 
HAS HE GONE TOO WIDE THIS IS SO 
TIGHT HE'S GOING DOWN THE SHOULDER 
AGAIN THAT IS SO CLOSE AMAZING 
ANTHONEY WINS A SECOND GOLD MEDAL 
THE PERFORMANCES WE PUT IN TODAY 
WE ARE USING THEM AS FOUNDATION 
FOR BEIJING WE ARE GOING TO BE 
SERIOUSLY COMPETITIVE IF WE CAN 
IMPROVE ON THAT IN BEIJING WE ARE 
GOING TO BE SERIOUSLY COMPETITIVE 
WILL BARNIE AND SIMON PUSHING ON TO 
BETTER THINGS 
THEY ARE NOT GOING 
TO SLOW US DOWN THAT'S THE 
IMPORTANT THING THEY WILL ONLY 
MAKE US GO FASTER 
SO BRITISH CYCLING IS MAKING 
TALENT TRANSFER A SUCCESS BUT IS IT 
TO THE DETRIMENT OF OTHER SPORTS 
MODEL'S CHANCES LOOKING AT THE AT 
LEAST COMING EVER FROM SWIMMING 
THEY HAVE GOT TO THE END OF THEIR 
CAREERS IN SWIMMING AND ARE LOOKING 
FOR A NEW CHALLENGE CYCLING IS 
VERY DIFFERENT PHYSICALLY BUT ALSO 
WE HAVE GOT VERY GOOD SET UP HERE 
IN BRITISH CYCLING THAT'S NICE FOR 
SOMEBODY LOOKING FOR A NEW 
CHALLENGE JODY CUNDY WAS PART OF 
THE GREAT BRITISH EFFORT AT THE 
VELODROME HE CLINCHED INDIVIDUAL 
GOLD ON DAY ONE AND THEN GOT 
SECOND GOLD AND A WORLD RECORD IN 
THE TEAM SPRINT FINAL ALONGSIDE 
MARK BRISTOW IT WAS DARREN KENNY'S 
SECOND GOLD EVENT AFTER HIS WIN ON 
DAY ONE ALAN HUNTER WAS EQUALLY 
IMPRESSIVE OVER THE TWO DAYS HER 
GOLD WAS FOLLOWED BY THE WORLD 
RECORD ON DAY TWO 
BUT BRITAIN WON'T HAVE IT ALL HER 
OWN WAY WITH BEIJING LOOMING 
CHINA HAD BROUGHT A TEN CYCLIST HERE 
AND CLEARLY THEY MEAN BUSINESS A 
HAUL OF SEVEN MEDALS FROM THE EVENT 
DOES NOT YET COMPARED TO THE EIGHT 
GOLD MEDALS WON BY GREAT BRITAIN 
BUT IT'S CLEAR THEY HAVE SOME 
STRONG PERFORMERS AND A BIG TALENT 
POOL 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE TEAM POOL SPRINT FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE 
CERTAINLY IMPROVED SO OBVIOUSLY 
THEIR TIME IS COMING DOWN AND THEY 
HAVE GOT A BIT MORE ROOM FOR 
IMPROVEMENT IF YOU LIKE SO YEAH 
OF COURSE THEY ARE A THREAT WITH 
THE HOME ADVANTAGE THE CHINESE 
CROWD SHOUTING THEM ON WE NEED TO 
BE ON THE BALL FOR SURE 
WHAT IS 
YOUR TARGET IN BEIJING HOW MANY 
MEDALS 
A LOT REALISTICALLY WE MEDALS ARE HOPING TO BRING HOME BETWEEN EIGHT 
AND TEN THAT WOULD BE A NICE MEDAL 
HAUL 
YET ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL HAUL COMPETITION FOR THE GREAT BRITAIN 
TEAM BUT NOW ALL EYES TURN TO CHINA 
IN TERMS OF HOW THEY PERFORM AND 
HOW GREAT BRITAIN WILL PERFORM ON 
THEIR TURF 
IT LOOKS AS IF WE CANNOT LOOK 
FORWARD TO SUCCESS FROM BOTH 
CYCLISTS THIS SUMMER OVER ONE WEEK 
AGO NATALIE DU TOIT WAS SOMETHING 
NOT IN A SWIMMING POOL LIKE THIS 
BUT IN OPEN WATER AT THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS IN SEVILLE THE OPEN 
WATER TENOR TO RAISE IS A NEW 
EVENT AT THIS YEAR'S BEIJING 
OLYMPIC GAMES SHE QUALIFIED FOR 
THOSE GAMES IN FOURTH PLACE BECOMING 
THE FIRST AMPUTEE TO QUALIFY FOR 
THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN HER OWN RIGHT 
A TRULY REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT AND 
SHE HAS BEEN MADE A STAR OVERNIGHT 
SHE HAS BEEN DOING A LOT OF MEDIA 
WORK THIS WEEK BUT AFTER ANOTHER 
TRAINING SESSION I CAUGHT UP WITH 
HER A PHENOMENAL ACHIEVEMENT IN 
SEVILLE LAST WEEK WHAT WAS THE 
INITIAL REACTION 
FOR ME THREE 
QUARTERS WAY THROUGH THE RACE I 
NOTICED I WAS IN THIRD AND I HAD 
MOVED UP THE RANKS SINCE THE FIRST 
LAP SO I JUST KNEW EVERYBODY WAS 
GOING TO COME FOR ME ON THE LAST 
ONE KILOMETRE LAP L. HAD TO KEEP IT 
GOING IT WAS TOUGH BUT I THOUGHT 
I CAN DO THIS L. HAD ONE LAP LEFT I HAVE GOT 
TO STAY HERE IF I WANT TO QUALIFY IN THE TOP TEN AND 
THAT'S WHEN MY ADRENALIN KICKED IN 
I HAD A MASSIVE CAMPAIGN MY 
HAMSTRING I HAD A MASSIVE CRAMP 
IN MY HAMSTRING L. WAS ALREADY IN 
TEARS EVERYTHING WAS GOING ON AND 
IT HAS NOT QUITE SUNK IN YET SO 
PROBABLY WHEN I GET HOME THE 
EMOTIONS WILL GO HIGHER 
WHAT WAS 
THE REACTION OF THE OTHER SWIMMERS 
IN A COMPETITION LIKE THAT 
YES I 
THINK I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT 
EVERYBODY IS COMPETITION YOU GET 
INTO THE WATER AND RACE IT'S NOT 
ABOUT BEING DISABLED OR NOT L. WAS 
DONE TO COUPLE OF TIMES AND I HAVE 
DONE FOR OTHER INTERNATIONAL 
COMPETITIONS AND I HAVE LED MOST OF 
THE WAY AND THEN PEOPLE SPRINT PAST 
ME AT THE FINISH THEY KNOW I'M NOT 
ONE OF THE BEST BACK STRIKERS 
HOPEFULLY THEY WILL 
I'M CURIOUS HOW YOU MAKE THE 
ADJUSTMENT BETWEEN THE TWO EVENTS 
FOR ME WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING IS 
CONCENTRATING ON MY LONG DISTANCE 
RACING IS USUALLY A TWO WEEK GAP 
BUT IN THE OLYMPICS AND THE 
PARALYMPICS WHICH I WILL PROBABLY 
JUST TAKE OUT L. WILL CONCENTRATE 
ON SPRINTING 
YOU HAVE BECOME AN 
ICON FOR THE PARALYMPIAN MOVEMENT 
IT'S 
YOUR STANDARDS ARE SO 
IT'S GREAT BY YOUR STANDARDS ARE SO HIGH 
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME BECAUSE HIGH IN THE WATER I SWIM WITHOUT AN AIDE 
AND MY FEDERATION SAYS I CAN'T SWIM 
WITH AN AIDE BUT HE MUST RUN WITH 
AN AIDE L. THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD 
HAVE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 
SO MANY WORDS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN AND 
SPOKEN AND INTERVIEWS GIVEN BY 
NATALIE DU TOIT THIS WEEK ONE OF FIVE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THE TIME THEY ARE AIMING FOR ALL EYES ON LANE FOUR NATALIE DU 
TOIT OF SOUTH AFRICA TEN K. OPEN

THERE TO LOSE THE RACE THAT'S WHAT 
ARE BASICALLY IS GOING ON HERE THE 
ONLY WAY THESE GUYS ARE GOING TO 
WIN HIS IF NATALIE DU TOIT MAKES A 
MESS OF IT VERY VERY STRONG ALL 
THE WAY THROUGH AT A WORLD RECORD 
TIME YOU CAN'T FAULT HER AT THE 
MOMENT SHE IS A LEGEND IN HER OWN 
SPEEDOS LILIES DOING A GOOD JOB THERE LOUISE LOUISE CONFIRMATION THAT NATALIE LOUISE DU TOIT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN 
ANYONE ELSE IN THIS EVENT BY ALMOST 
FIVE SECONDS 
THAT IS A FANTASTIC WAY TO ROUND OF 
A PHENOMENAL WEEK 
YES I JUST WENT 
OUT THERE TO TRY MY BEST AT THE 
START I SAW THE AUSTRALIAN GO NEXT 
TOOMEY AND SHE STARTED BEFORE ME A 
BIT SLOW ON THE FIRST FIFTEEN AND CAME 
BACK VERY NICELY L. WAS VERY HAPPY 
WITH THAT IT WAS MY FIRST TIME 
SWIMMING ONE HUNDRED METRES AFTER TEN 
KILOMETRES I WHEN WITH AN OPEN 
MIND AND HAD A BIT OF FUN YES I 
THINK 
IT IS 
GREAT A WE 
HAS PASSED 
AND I 
WILL COME 
BACK FOR 
PARALYMPICS AND GET BETTER FOR THAT 
WORLD RECORD 
THE CHINESE WERE FORMIDABLE DOES 
THE CHINESE SWIMMER WAS A 
FORMIDABLE OPPONENT IN THE NEXT 
EVENT HE IS POWERING AWAY FROM THE REST 
OF THE FIELD LOOK AT THE GAP IT 
MUST BE ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE METRES 
NOW THE AUSTRALIAN IS TRYING TO 
STAY WITH HIM IN THE ADJOINING LANE 
YOU CAN SEE VISUALLY HOW FAR THE 
CHINESE IS THERE IS NO WANG WIN 
TODAY 
A I TALKED TO SAM EARLIER TODAY TODAY AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE 
RACE AND HE HAS BEEN BLOWN OUT OF 
THE WATER WIND I TALKED TO 
HE HAS BLOWN AND IT BLOWN OUT OF 
THE WATER SAM HAS OBLITERATED THE 
FIELD HERE 
WHEN SAMBROOK THAT 
WORLD RECORD BEATING WANG'S TIME 
HE TOOK SEVENTEEN SECONDS OF IT HE MAY 
BE TAKING A HUGE AMOUNT OF HIS 
PREVIOUS WORLD BEST JUST LOOK AT 
THE MARGIN BETWEEN FIRST AND SECOND THIS IS GOING TO BE AN EXCEPTIONAL 
TIME HE IS AHEAD OF THE PACE THAT 
HEAT DID WHEN HE BROKE THE WORLD 
RECORD 
THAT HE DID SAM HAS A RECORD HUGE MARGIN AND EVER INCREASING 
MARGIN LOOK AT THE GAP IT WAS 
WELL OVER SIX SECONDS LAST TIME IT 
IS GOING TO BE PROBABLY TEN SECONDS 
THIS TIME MAYBE EVEN MORE THIS IS 
ALL ABOUT ONE MAN ONLY ONE MAN HAS 
BEEN INVOLVED FROM FIFTY ONWARDS 
ABSOLUTELY HE HAS PUT THE PRESSURE 
ON GETTING FASTER AND FASTER ALL 
THE WAY THROUGH WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOME TO BREAK 
HIS EXISTING WORLD RECORD IS HE 
GOING TO DO IT YES HE HAS DONE IT 
BY A THIRD OF SECOND ANOTHER 
GREAT TRIUMPH FOR A BRITISH 
DISABLED SWIMMER SAM THESE THE 
REST OF THE FIELD BY NINE SECONDS AN INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTING SOME 
ARE FROM THE FORMER CHINESE WORLD 
RECORD HOLDER WANG WHO CAME FOURTH 
HE WAS TRY TO PACE HIMSELF TO BEGIN 
WITH AND THEN HE REALISED HE WAS 
GOING TO BE SO 
MUCH QUICKER 
THAN 
EVERYBODY 
ELSE HE 
JUST SWAM HIS OWN 
RACE 
A WORLD RECORD FANTASTIC 
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC WE HAD A ME 
BEFORE THIS WHERE I WAS FEELING A 
BIT JADED BUT TO GO OUT THERE AND 
SWIM AT FAST IS A CONFIDENCE 
BOOSTER FOR BEIJING SWIM THAT 
FAST I WILL BE GIVING IT ALL IN 
BEIJING BEIJING CONFIRMATION OF A NEW WORLD RECORD 
BEATING HIS PREVIOUS ONE NINE 
SECONDS CLEAR OF THE GERMAN 
NEXT UP THE MEN'S INDIVIDUAL 
MEDLEY THIS IS AN EVENT WHICH HAS 
BEEN DOMINATED IN RECENT TIMES BY 
KINDRED HE IS A FOUR TIMES 
PARALYMPIC CHAMPION HE IS ONE OF 
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BRITISH 
SWIMMERS OF ALL TIME THAT HAVING 
BEEN SAID HE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO 
THE CHALLENGE IN BEIJING 
WE HAVE TRAINED TOWARDS THE WORLD 
CUP SO THEY CAN HIT OUT WITH A GOOD 
RACE A COUPLE OF MY MAIN RIVALS 
ARE OUT HERE AND SO IT WILL BE A 
GOOD CHANCE FOR ME TO 
SEE HOW 
THEY 
ARE 
SWIMMING AND 
MAYBE GET 
AN EDGE 
OVER THEM 
AND PUT 
SOME PRESSURE 
THEM TO MAKE 
SURE THEY 
ARE TRYING 
TO PUT 
ME BACK 
IN BEIJING 
THAT IS 
THE AIM 
TO GO 
INTO BEIJING 
AS NO ONE 
WE MAY 
WORK ON 
ONE SET 
OF STROKES 
THAT I NEED 
TO IMPROVE 
ON FOR THIS 
MEAT I AM WORKING OUT MY 
BREASTSTROKE AM TRYING TO ANALYSE 
WHAT HAS TO BE IMPROVED BETWEEN NOW 
AND BEIJING ONE OF THE SUPERSTARS OF BRITISH 
SWIMMING HE IS BEING INTRODUCED TO 
THE CROWDS HERE IN MANCHESTER 
THERE ARE THE FIGURES IN THE FIVE 
SWIMMERS HE HAS BEEN SO CONSISTENT IN THE 
LAST FEW YEARS WE WILL SEE WHAT HE 
DOES OVER THE FIRST FIFTY STRAIGHT 
INTO HIS BUTTERFLY VERY QUICKLY 
INDEED ALONGSIDE HIM THOUGH WAS 
YANG OF CHINA THE OTHER TWO BRITS 
ARE ON THE OUTSIDE THERE ARE 
POTENTIALLY GOOD SWIMMERS THEIR THEIR STRENGTH IS IN THE BREAST STROKE 
THREE STAR PART OF THE RACE SO YOU 
EXPECT THEM TO BE BEHIND AT THIS 
STAGE FREESTYLE 
YANG HAS TRIED 
TO HOLD ON TO THEM IN SECOND PLACE 
A BIT OF A GAP BETWEEN FIRST AND 
SECOND THIS IS WHERE ON THE 
BACKSTROKE LEG SASHA SHOULD COME 
INTO HIS OWN HE REALLY IS A MEDLEY SWIMMER AND A 
BREASTSTROKE SWIMMER THAT IS WHERE 
WE WILL SEE HIM COME INTO HIS OWN 
COMING UP TO THE HALFWAY MARK BUT 
DON'T EXPECT IT TO BE LIKE THIS BY 
THE END OF THE BREASTSTROKE 
IT IS 
THE HALFWAY STAGE SHALL THIS IS 
WHERE WE SHOULD SEE HIM AT HIS VERY 
BEST THE HALFWAY STAGE ALREADY 
PULLING AWAY FROM YANG 
THIS IS 
WHERE THE STRENGTH COME FROM SACHA 
WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THE OTHER 
BRITS BUT THERE ARE NOT GOING TO 
A SHAKE UP FOR THE HEAD OF 
THE RACE THAT IS FOR THE WORLD 
RECORD HOLDER IN THE INDIVIDUAL 
MEDLEY YANG IS FINDING IT HARD ON 
THE BREASTSTROKE LEG WE ARE 
LOOKING AT KINDRED STREAMING AWAY 
FROM THE REST OF THEIR PACK THE 
PACK 
JUST OUTSIDE HIS WORLD RECORD PACK PACE BY A COUPLE OF SECONDS MATT 
HAS MOVED INTO THIRD PLACE ALL ALL EYES THOUGH ON THE MAN IN A RED 
CAP A LOCAL LAD A BIG MANCHESTER

HAS DOMINATED THE EVENT FOR THE 
LAST FOUR YEARS

ANOTHER GOLD MEDAL TO ADD TO YOUR 
TALLY HOW DID YOU RATE YOUR 
PERFORMANCE 
IT WAS A STRONG PERFORMANCE SWIMMER I WOULD HAVE DONE CUP

MEDAL WITH A HARD FOUGHT DOMINANT 
VICTORY OVER THE BRAZILIANS L. AM

A SHOT AT THE GOLD 
MEDAL AS 
THEY 
WILL

SWEDEN A STRONG ALL ROUND 
PERFORMANCE LET US LOOK AHEAD AT 
THE GOLD MEDAL GAME ANOTHER 
INSTALMENT OF THE RIVALRY BETWEEN 
AMERICA AND TEAM G. B. HOW DO YOU 
THINK IT IS GOING TO GO QUESTION A 
I THINK IT WILL BE FANTASTIC 
IT IS 
KEY THAT WE START OFF WELL AND WE 
KEEP OUR INTENSITY HADI THINK IT 
IS GOING TO GO WE HAVE TO PLAY OUR 
GAME HOW DO YOU THINK IT IS 
GOING TO GO WE CANNOT BE AFFECTED 
BY THE PRESSURE THAT AMERICA IS 
GOING TO PUT ON US 
HOW DO YOU 
MANAGE THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN 
PLAYING FOR A SPOT IN BEIJING AND A 
PLANE TO WIN AGAINST THEIR RIVALS 
AND GET A MEDAL HOW DO YOU BALANCE 
THAT OUT 
IT IS DIFFICULT FOCUS ON 
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO HELP YOU 
TEAM WHEN AND LET THE REST OF IT DO 
WITH ITSELF 
WHAT IS 
IMPORTANT IS 
THAT YOU 
DO WHAT 
IS RIGHT FOR THE 
TEAM 
O. K. WE WILL COMMENTATE ON THE TEAM GAME SHORTLY LET US GET TO IT THE 
LATEST INSTALMENT OF THIS LONG 
RUNNING RIVALRY IT IS TEAM SHE 
BEAT VERSUS AMERICA THE OPENING EXCHANGES WERE CAUTIOUS 
AND K. G. BOTH TEAMS WERE LOOKING FOR 
HIGH PERCENTAGE SHOTS K. G. 
DESPITE THE IMMENSE PRESSURE OF A 
CHAMPIONSHIP GAME POISE AND POURS 
WEATHER WATCH WORDS TEAM G. B. WERE 
ALL OVER THE COURT WHILE AMERICA 
CONTINUED TO POUND AWAY THEY WERE 
BOTH EQUALLY EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES 
AND THERE WERE ENOUGH THERE WAS 
NOTHING IN IT ANY BREATHING SPACE 
TEAM G. B. WERE SHORT LIVED MATTERS 
WERE KEPT CLOSE WITH SOME DEADLY 
THREE POINT SHOOTING THE SECOND 
HALF CONTINUED IN THE SAME VEIN 
HIGH QUALITY BASKETBALL IN A HIGH 
STAKES GAME NEITHER TEAM WAS ABLE 
TO ASSERT ANY DOMINANCE OVER THE 
OTHER AS WE JOIN IT IN THE FOURTH 
QUARTER THE GAME IS TIRED FORTY SEVEN 
POINTS EACH THE GAME IS TIED 
FORTY SEVEN TO FORTY SEVEN 
HE MAKES THE CONVERSION ON THE 
INSIDE WHAT A MONSTER GAME SIMON 
AS HAVING TWENTY TWO PERSONAL POINTS IS 
HAVING IN THIS GOLD MEDAL GAME HE HE DID A GREAT JOB OF FINDING HIM 
INSIDE 
THERE WE SEE JOSEPH INSIDE CHAMBERS'S RESPONSE AT THE OTHER 
END SHOOTING OVER SIMON POLLOCK 
HE WILL GO OVER THE LINE TO TRY AND 
MAKE IT THREE CHAMBERS GETS THE BONUS THREE 
POINT PLAY AMERICA FIFTY GREAT 
BRITAIN FORTY NINE MINUTES REMAINING IN 
THE GOLD MEDAL GAME IT GOES BACK 
TO THE MIDDLE LOTS OF MOTION ON 
BOTH SIDES OF THE BASKETBALL COURT 
IT IS IN THE HANDS OF POLLOCK 
BEAUTIFUL STROKE FROM JOHNNY 
POLLOCK THAT GIVES GREAT BRITAIN A 
TWO POINT ADVANTAGE WITH JUST UNDER 
SIX MINUTES REMAINING IN THE GAME 
IT'S A MOMENTOUS SWING THERE 
GREATER SHOT FROM JONATHAN POLLACK 
UNDER PRESSURE NICE EXTENDING 
CATCH CATCH FOUL ON THE BYLINE AGAIN 
JOE CHAMBERS IS HAVING SUCH A GOOD 
GAME HE IS GETTING HIM SELF INTO 
GREAT POSITIONS MAKING THE SHOTS 
FIVE MINUTES THIRTY NINE SECONDS REMAINING 
IN THIS GOLD MEDAL GAME FIFTY TO FIFTY TWO HE 
MISSES THE FIRST CHAMBERS JOSEPH CHAMBERS DOES NOT CONVERT 
AN OFFENSIVE REBOUND TEAM U. S. A. HAVE 
ANOTHER TWENTY FOUR SECONDS BY WATER 
JOHNNY POLLOCK HAS IT ON THE RIGHT 
SIDE LONG PASS GOOD ONE HANDED 
CATCH BY THE GREAT BRITAIN NO EIGHT 
HE TRIES TO GO INSIDE BUT BROKEN UP 
BY THIS COMBINATION NOT ABLE TO 
CONVERT GREAT HUSTLE HE DISTRACTS 
HIM EFFICIENTLY 
THE PASS WAS A BIT STRONG 
FROM THE JOHNNIE POLLOCK THE 
REFEREE WAS NOT IMPRESSED A LITTLE 
TOO STRONG 
I THINK AS THE GAME 
GETS A BIT STRESSED THE ADRENALIN 
FLEW WITH JONATHAN 
GOES FOR THE 
SCOOP SHOT BUT DOES NOT GET IT 
THREE REBOUNDS ON THE OFFENCE HE 
MAKES THE FOURTH ONE SIX THAT TIES 
THE BALL GAME AT FIFTY TWO TO FIFTY TWO FORTY FIVE MINUTES

OFFENCE OFFENCE FOUL HE WAS IN THE LANE ARE TRYING 
TO CATCH THE BALL THE CLOCK 
TICKING DOWN AND ALL KINDS OF

INCREASES 
WHAT DOES ALEX FERGUSON INCREASES SAY SQUEAKY BOMB TIME FLIPPED OVER THREE SECOND VIOLATION TURNOVER WITHOUT A SHOT FOR GREAT 
BRITAIN ALL OF THESE POSSESSIONS 
ARE BECOMING CRUCIAL NOW 
THE YES 
EVERY SINGLE POSSESSION NOW IS HUGE INSIDE

BUT DOES NOT CONVERT THE SHOT IT 
WILL GO TO THE LINE GREAT GREAT EXECUTION GREAT PATIENCE FROM THE 
U. S. A. TO GET THEMSELVES THAT 
OPPORTUNITY IT'S UNFORTUNATE THEY 
COULD NOT FINISH IT 
WE TALKED 
ABOUT THE SPEED OF MATTHEW SCOTT

THE YOUNGSTERS WHO HAS BEEN GIVEN 
VALUABLE INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE

ENTHRALLING GOLD MEDAL CHAMPIONSHIP 
MATCH IN THE PARALYMPIC WORLD CUP 
TEEN U. S. A. PREVAIL BY A SIXTY TO FIFTY EIGHT AN 
OUTSTANDING GAME DISAPPOINTMENT 
FOR GREAT BRITAIN 
WHAT POSITIVE TO TAKE FOR BEIJING 
POSITIVE WE ARE NEW TEAM THE 
TEAM IS BEING PICKED UP THIS WEEK 
THIS IS OUR FIRST TOURNAMENT OF THE 
YEAR GOING TO BEIJING AND WE HAVE 
COME SECOND WE HAVE LOST TO 
PROBABLY ONE OF THE TWO BEST TEAMS 
IN THE WORLD BY TWO POINTS SO WE 
ARE GOING TO TAKE A LOT FROM THIS 
GAME FROM THIS WEEK AS WELL AND 
GO ON FROM THERE 
WHAT DID YOU 
LEARN ABOUT YOUR SQUAD OVER THE 
FOUR DAYS 
SIMON IS A HELL OF AN 
ATHLETE FOR A FORTY YEAR OLD L. THINK 
WE HAVE THE EMERGENCE OF THE 
YOUNGER SQUAD PLAYERS CONSISTENCY 
IS STILL AN ISSUE BUT THERE IS A 
BASIS FOR US TO HAVE A COMPETITIVE 
TEAM IN BEIJING AND THEN GOING 
FORWARD TO LONDON WE THINK WE HAVE 
UNEARTHED SOME VERY GOOD KIDS FOR 
THE FUTURE 
SO A SILVER MEDAL FOR 
GREAT BRITAIN BUT LOTS OF POSITIVE 
FOR THE COACH TO BUILD ON AHEAD OF 
BEIJING TO THE VICTORS THE SPOILS 
THE U. S. A. WIN IN THEIR FIRST OLYMPICS 
THE PARALYMPICS YOU REMEMBER 
WINNING FOUR YEARS AGO A NEW 
GENERATION OF PLAYERS BUT HOW CLOSE 
ARE THEY TO WHERE YOU WERE HOW FAR 
WILL THEY GO AT THE OLYMPICS THIS 
SUMMER 
THEY HAVE GOT A LOT OF GOOD SUMMER SIMILAR QUALITIES TO THE TEAM WHICH 
WON THE BRONZE MEDAL IN ATHENS 
THEY NEED TO BE BATTLE TESTED 
THROUGHOUT THE TOURNAMENT THEY 
HAVE SHOWN FOR SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE GAME 
THEY CAN PERFORM AT THE HIGH LEVEL 
IT'S THE FINAL TWENTY FIVE PER CENT THEY HAVE GOT 
TO FIND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WINS 
MEDALS THE SECOND THING THEY 
REALLY NEED TO FIND IS A CONSISTENT 
THIRD SCORER ALL OF THE TOP TEAMS 
IN THE WORLD HAVE AT LEAST THREE 
PLAYERS WHO CAN SCORE AND WHETHER 
THEY FIND IT FROM ONE PLAYER OR A 
COMBINATION OF THE REST OF THE TEAM 
THEY NEED TO FIND THAT 
O. K. THANKS 
FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION IS AFTERNOON 
SEE YOU IN BEIJING 
SO BRONZE FOR THE WOMEN SILVER 
FOR THE MEN AND POSSIBLY GOLD IN 
BEIJING LOTS TO WORK ON IN THE 
TEAM AND WE WILL SEE THEM AT THE

ATHLETES ARE MCGRORY IS A VERY 
STRONG FINISHER SHE WILL HAVE TO 
MAKE A MOVE SOON SURELY 
THIS IS 
WHERE IT STARTED TO GO AROUND 
WRONG AND THE FOUR HUNDRED METRES FOR 
SHELLEY SHE HAS TO GO THE LONG WAY 
ROUND THEY ARE ALL LINING UP 
BEHIND HER NO WAY OUT FOR GALLI 
IT IS GOING TO BE A BLANKET FINISH 
AMANDA MCGRORY COMING AWAY SHE IS 
RIGHT ON THE INSIDE AS WELL AMANDA 
MCGRORY WINS IT AN AMERICAN ONE 
TWO SHELLY WOODS PICKED OFF THEIR 
SHASHI PICKED UP A COUPLE OF 
ATHLETES LATE IN THE RACE TO COME 
IN THIRD WELL TACTICALLY SHE DID 
NOT QUITE GET IT RIGHT AGAIN THERE 
IS THE WINNER AMANDA MCGRORY SHE 
HAS HAD A WONDERFUL AFTERNOON 
QUESTIONS WILL BE ASKED OF SHIRLEY 
A LITTLE BIT NAIVE PERHAPS IN HER 
TACTICAL RACING ON THE TRACK 
SHIRLEY WINNER HAD GOOD SHE IS ON 
THE ROAD SHE HAS WON THE LONDON 
MARATHON AND THE GREAT NORTH RUN 
WHAT DID YOU THINK TANNI 
SHE WAS 
NOT AT HER TOP SPEED IT IS A BIG 
RISK TO LEAVE IT THAT LONG SHE HAD 
TO COME LESLEY INTO LANE FOUR 
THERE WAS PLENTY MORE SPEED LEFT IN 
HER BUT SHE NEEDED TO KICK A BIT 
EARLIER WELL BETTER IT HAD BEEN 
HERE THAN IN BEIJING THAT IS FOR 
SURE 
SHELLEY IS LEARNING ALL THE SURE TIME A GOOD AFTERNOON FOR THE 
AMERICANS AMANDA MCGRORY JUST 
LEAVING A GAP BUT JESSICA GALLI 
COULD NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT ON 
THE INSIDE THE AMERICANS FINISH IN 
FIRST AND SECOND PLACE 
COMING UP LIVE ON THE TRACK WE 
HAVE IAN JONES IN THE ONE HUNDRED METRES 
BUT BEFORE THAT LET US HAVE A LOOK 
AT AN EVENT THAT HAPPENED EARLIER 
THE SKIDBY A VERY COMPETITIVE RACE 
INDEED THIS COULD BE 
BAALA GOT A CRACKING START THERE 
BALLADE GRAHAM BALLADE THE PARALYMPIC 
CHAMPION AND THE WORLD RECORD 
HOLDER IS RIGHT UP ON HIS SHOULDER 
HE HAS TO STAY COOL CALM AND 
COLLECTED THE CHINESE ATHLETE WINS 
IT A VERY GOOD TIME INDEED TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR 
IT IS ABOUT EIGHT TENSE OF A SECOND 
OUTSIDE OF HIS WORLD RECORD 
EIGHT TENTS THE PARALYMPIC 
CHAMPION FOUR YEARS AGO HAS 
CERTAINLY IS THE FAVOURITE TO TAKE 
THE TIE TO A LAGOON A GOOD RUN BY 
GRAHAM THOUGH 
WELL HE HAS CAUSED A BIT OF A 
SURPRISE THERE PROBABLY THE BEST I 
HAVE EVER SEEN HIM START HE PUT 
THE CHINESE ATHLETE UNDER A LOT OF 
PRESSURE UNTIL THE LAST ZERO METRES 
OR SO BUT THE BOOK GRAHAM IN 
REALLY GOOD POSITION GOING INTO 
BEIJING THIS YEAR 
A TERRIFIC VICTORY THERE CERTAINLY 
HE IS THE MAN TO BEAT 
WELL SORRY TO STOP YOU SO SOON 
AFTER THE RACE IT HAS BEEN A BUSY 
AFTERNOON HOW DO YOU THINK IT HAS 
GONE 
MY FIRST RACE WAS NOT TOO GONE GOOD BUT MY SECOND RACE WAS BETTER 
I MADE TOO MANY MISTAKES IN THE 
FIRST RACE AND I HAD SOME TROUBLE 
WITH THE STEERING THAT IS NO 
EXCUSE IT WAS MY OWN FAULT THE 
SECOND RACE WAS BETTER L. WAS MORE 
PATIENT AND WAITED FOR THINGS TO 
OPEN UP A BIT THESE GIRLS ARE SO 
HOT AT THE MOMENT EVERYONE IS FAST 
AND STRONG BUT IT IS ABOUT GETTING 
THE TACTICS RAPE RIGHT IT IS 
MORE LIKE A GAME YOU KNOW YOU HAVE 
A WEAPON AND IT IS WORKING OUT HOW 
TO USE IT L. AM STILL TRYING TO 
FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO PACE IT 
BUT AS LONG AS I LEARNED FROM MY 
MISTAKES AND GET BETTER AND TRY 
AND DO BETTER NEXT TIME IT SHOULD 
BE O. K. I GUESS THAT WHITE I GUESS 
THAT IS WHY COMPETITIONS LIKE THIS 
IT ARE SO IMPORTANT YOU ARE STILL 
YOUNG AND IMPROVING AND GAINING 
EXPERIENCE 
YES THE RACES TODAY EXPERIENCE WERE ALL TACTICAL THEY WERE NOT 
PARTICULARLY FAST BUT THEY WERE 
TACTICAL YOU DON'T GET THAT VERY 
OFTEN WE HEAD OUT TO SWITZERLAND 
NEXT WEEK AND EVERYONE WILL BE 
THERE AND WE WILL SEE HOW EVERYONE 
IS DOING YOU CAN TRY AND BEAT THE 
HELL OUT OF YOUR COMPETITORS BUT 
SOMETIMES IT JUST DOES NOT WORK 
SOMETIMES IF YOU SIT BACK YOU CAN 
JUST HOPE FOR SOMETHING TO OPEN UP 
AND GET OUT THERE AND SPIN IT IS 
GOOD FUN IT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU 
CAN DO IN TRAINING 
IT IS 
SOMETHING 
YOU LEARN ALL THE TIME BY RACING 
THANK YOU THANK YOU 
THE NEXT EVENT THE ONE HUNDRED METRES 
THERE IS GUY WHO HAS RUN 
BRILLIANTLY ALREADY THIS AFTERNOON 
IAN JONES OF GREAT BRITAIN LIVES 
IN CHESHIRE EARLIER ON TODAY IN 
THE FOUR HUNDRED METRES IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE 
A BLISTERING RUN BLISTERING RUN 
HE SET EUROPEAN RECORD THE 
SHORTER SPRINT SHE SHOULD SUIT 
IAN JONES AS WELL IAN JONES HAS DEVELOPED BEAUTIFULLY 
OVER THIS LAST YEAR SINGLETON HE 
RAN 
Y. 
WELL IN THE TWO HUNDRED 
METRES EARLIER ON TODAY HE CAME IN 
SECOND PLACE OLIVEIRA HE FINISHED 
THIRD IN THAT EVENT THAT WAS AN 
EVENT THAT IAN JONES DID NOT 
CONTEST IAN JONES FINISHED FOURTH IN 
THE ONE HUNDRED METRES A COUPLE OF YEARS 
AGO LAST YEAR IN FACT HE SECOND 
THAT SHE WAS SECOND IN THIS EVENT 
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IN MANCHESTER HE WAS 
SECOND IN THIS EVENT BASH A VERY 
USEFUL COMPETITOR INDEED POW OSH 
FINALLY OUT IN LANE SECOND THE 
VERY TALL WELL BALANCED CASEY 
TIBBS WINNER OF THE TWO HUNDRED METRES 
EARLIER ON TODAY CERTAINLY 
CHANCE FOR IAN JONES TO IMPRESS WE 
THOUGHT OF HIM AS A ONE HUNDRED METRE AND 
TWO HUNDRED METRE MAN LAST YEAR BUT IN 
THAT RACE WHERE HE SET THE EUROPEAN 
RECORD WELL HE IS JUST A TEENAGER 
HE IS ONLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD SUCH 
PROMMERS SUCH POTENTIAL BUT CAN 
HE HOLD IT TOGETHER IN THIS 
COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT PROMISE 
TWO VERY GOOD AMERICANS ON THE 
INSIDE AND OUTSIDE LANE HE WILL 
HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR THEM BUT IAN 
JONES STARTS AS FAVOURITE THE 
WORLD RECORD IS A STAGGERING ONE THOUSAND NINETY ONE 
SECONDS HELD BY THE FLYING SOUTH 
AFRICAN JONES GOT AWAY PRETTY WELL SO DID 
CASEY TIBBS ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE 
OF THE SCREEN THE BRAZILIAN HAS 
PULLED OUT JEROME SINGLETON THE 
AMERICAN IS FLYING HE HAS WON IT 
CASEY TIBBS IN SECOND AND IAN JONES 
IN THIRD THAT WAS VERY GOOD TIME 
IAN JONES PERHAPS THE EFFORTS OF 
THE FOUR HUNDRED METRES EARLIER THIS 
AFTERNOON MAYBE TOOK THEIR TOLL 
LITTLE BIT BUT THAT WAS BY FAR AND 
AWAY THE BEST RUN WE HAVE SEEN FROM 
JEROME AND SINGLETON DURING THE 
COURSE OF THIS YEAR JEROME 
SINGLETON I THINK JONES IS GOING TO BE VERY 
VERY HAPPY WITH THIS HE BURST ONTO 
THE SCREEN IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND HE GETS 
THROUGH BETTER AND BETTER JONES 
COMES THROUGH VERY STRONG AND HE 
LOOKS VERY GOOD TO MAKE THE TEAM 
FOR BEIJING THIS YEAR THE TWO HUNDRED METRES THERE ONE HUNDRED METRES 
RATHER THE TWO HUNDRED METRES HAS ALREADY 
GONE IAN JONES A BIT DISAPPOINTED 
PERHAPS HE'S HAD VERY GOOD 
AFTERNOON AT ANYWHERE EARLIER ON 
TODAY WE SAW SOME GREAT TRACK AND 
FIELD EVENTS HERE WE WERE 
EXPECTING JESSICA GARLIC TO COME 
THROUGH VERY STRONGLY BUT IN FACT 
IT WAS VERY GOOD CHINESE ATHLETE 
WHO HAD ALREADY WON THE ONE HUNDRED METRES 
WHO ABSOLUTELY FLEW THROUGH THE 
LINE AND BEATING HER AND THE 
CANADIAN ATHLETES THAN THE ONE HUNDRED 
METRES RUNNERS GRAEME BALLARD GOT 
INTO VERY VERY GOOD START 
STREAKING AWAY THE PARALYMPIC 
WORLD CHAMPION HOLDER DID WELL

RECORD OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN MANCHESTER THE 
TUNISIAN SHOT PUTTER EIGHT METRES 
EIGHTY ONE SHE BEAT THE FORMER WORLD 
RECORD BY ALMOST ONE METRE IT WAS 
ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS BEVERLEY JONES 
WORLD RECORD HOLDER IN HER CATEGORY 
SHE FINISHED SECOND IN HER EVENT 
SHE WAS BEATEN BY CHINA 
NEVERTHELESS BEVERLEY JONES IS 
STILL ONE OF THE FAVOURITES FOR THE 
TITLE IN THE HIGH JUMP 
AN INCREDIBLE DISPLAY THIS WAS HIS TWO METRE FIVE 
CENTIMETRE CLEARANCE AND HE WENT ON 
TO ATTEMPT TO METRES ELEVEN BUT 
FAILED IT THREE TIMES L. WOULD NOT 
BE AT ALL SURPRISED IF THE SAW 
WORLD RECORD FIGURES FROM THIS MAN 
IN THE FUTURE 
IAN JONES IS WITH ME NOW YOU HAVE 
HAD A BUSY AFTERNOON A COUPLE OF 
GOOD AMERICANS AHEAD OF YOU IT'S IT'S BEEN A GOOD RACE IT'S NOT MY BEST 
EVENT 
THE FOUR HUNDRED METRES EARLIER ON EVENT MUST HAVE POLICE DO 
YES I HAVE 
RUN QUICKER THAN AT THIS SEASON BUT 
IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO GET A GOOD 
TIMES HOPEFULLY I WILL BE SELECTED 
FOR BEIJING 
MANCHESTER IS GOOD 
ISN'T IT YOU'RE A LOCAL LAD YES YES MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY ARE HERE SO 
IT'S GOOD 
THE TEAM GETS PICKED 
SHORTLY HOW WOULD YOU PREPARE 
BETWEEN NOW AND SEPTEMBER KEEPER KEEPER BEING INCONSISTENT AND GETTING 
UNDER THE QUALIFYING TIMES AND I 
HAVE GOT A GOOD CHANCE 
WHAT IS 
YOUR MAIN HOPE 
TO BEAT OSCAR 
BEIJING WILL BE BRILLIANT IAN IAN JONES A NAME TO WATCH FOR IN THE 
PARALYMPIC GAMES IN SEPTEMBER 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT SOME MORE 
EVENTS FROM EARLY ON THESE ATHLETES HAVE VISUAL IMPAIRMENT THE REASON IS A FEW GAPS DOWN HERE 
IT'S BECAUSE THESE ATHLETES ARE 
ALLOWED TO RUN WITH GUIDE RUNNERS 
BUT THEY HAD ELECTED NOT TO JASON 
SMITH IN THE CENTRE ONE THOUSAND EIGHTY SIX SECONDS 
HE IS THE WORLD RECORD HOLDER FOR 
HIS CATEGORY HERE COMES THE IRISH 
MAN JASON SMITH ALREADY WORLD 
CHAMPION AND CERTAINLY THE FAVOURED 
FOR THE PARALYMPIC TITLE POLAND IN 
SECOND PLACE HE HAS EQUALLED HIS 
WORLD RECORD THIS TEENAGER REALLY 
HAS GOT EVERYTHING GOING FOR HIM AT 
THE MOMENT HE RAN AGAINST SOME OF 
BRITAIN'S BEST A FEW YEARS AGO AND 
HE IS JUST GETTING BETTER AND 
BETTER 
ABSOLUTELY STUNNING FROM BETTER JASON RIGHT FROM THE START HE IS 
AWAY AND STRONG IT'S A BIG LOSS 
FOR GREAT BRITAIN WE HAVE THROWN 
AWAY GOLD MEDAL BY HIM CHOOSING TO 
RUN FOR IRELAND 
JASON SMITH IN 
TERRIFIC FORM HE RAN AWAY FROM 
EVERYBODY 
A FABULOUS RUN WHAT ABOUT YOUR 
IMPRESSION OF THAT 
YES I WAS 
HAPPY MY FIRST RACE OUT L. BLEW 
THE COBWEBS AWAY IT'S BEEN A WHILE 
SINCE I HAD A RACE 
WHEN PEOPLE 
NORMALLY RUN A WORLD RECORDS THEY 
LOOKED HAPPIER THAN YOU ARE DO YOU 
THINK YOU CAN GO QUICKER I'D I'D DEFINITELY DO L. WASN'T SURE 
EXACTLY WHAT THE TIME IS TEN POINT TEN POINT EIGHTY FIVE EXACTLY IT'S CONFIRMED AS A 
WORLD RECORD 
I'M A VERY MUCH 
DELIGHTED WITH THAT BUT IS MORE TO 
COME 
THERE IS CONFIRMATION OF COME JASON SMITH WORLD RECORD 
PERFORMANCE PERFORMANCE A MAGNIFICENT TIME AND HE SET 
HIMSELF UP A BEAUTIFULLY FOR THE 
BEIJING OLYMPICS 
JASON SMITH CERTAINLY IS A NAME TO 
WATCH OUT FOR IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S 
GOT A BIG FUTURE AHEAD OF HIM ALSO 
DAVID WEIR WE ARE GOING TO SEE HIM 
SHORTLY HOW MANY MEDALS COULD HE 
WIN 
HE COULD WIN FIVE HE HAS NOT WIN DECIDED THE NUMBER OF EVENTS IS 
GOING TO CONTEST HE IS GOING TO 
LEAVE IT TO BEIJING TO MAKE THE 
FINAL DECISION L. 
THINK YOU'LL BE 
ALL FIVE EVENTS 
HE'S ALREADY BEEN 
IN ACTION TODAY 
TACTICALLY HE 
MADE A SUPERB DECISIONS HE WAS IN 
FRONT CONTROLLED IT ANOTHER GREAT 
RACE FROM DAVE 
HE IS NO SLOUCH 
OVER FOUR HUNDRED METRES EITHER 
LAST YEAR 
HE WAS VIRTUALLY UNBEATABLE HE HAS 
GOT AN AMAZING START AN AMAZING 
TOP END AND IN THE LONG DISTANCES 
HE IS ABLE TO RAISE AND HE CAN PICK 
WHATEVER TACTICS HE WANTS TO SUIT 
HIM ON THE DAY 
DAVID WEIR STARTS AS FAVOURITE IT'S A VERY COMPETITIVE FIELD DAVID WEIR 
THE WORLD RECORD HOLDER THE CHAMPIONSHIP RECORD HOLDER 
WILL START AS FAVOURITE PATEL 
FORMER WINNER OF THE GREAT NORTH 
RUN ADMITS HE'S TAKEN HIS EYE OFF 
THE BALL LITTLE BIT IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING AS THE BODY CAN DO HERE 
BRIAN IS COACHED BY TANNI GREY 
THOMPSON AND IS IMPROVING ALL 
THROUGHOUT THE SEASON YOU CAN 
NEVER WRITE OFF THE CHINESE THEY 
ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE POWERFUL 
IN PARALYMPIC SPORT ESPECIALLY 
ATHLETICS DAVID WEIR THE VELOCITY 
WHEELCHAIR RACES JENNY ARCHER HIS 
COACH HAS TUNED THIS ATHLETE UP 
BEAUTIFULLY THE WORLD RECORD 
HOLDER CERTAINLY HE HAS GOT THE 
BEST LANE DAVID WEIR LANE FIVE 
THE THAILAND PLAYER VERY USEFUL 
ATHLETE NO MATTER WHAT THE 
DISTANCE ONE HUNDRED METRES FIVE THOUSAND METRES 
OR MARATHON HE IS VERY GOOD HIS 
TEAM MADE FINISHED FIFTH IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
THERE HE IS LOOKING A LITTLE BIT 
NERVOUS NOT GOOD LANE FOR HIM 
FINALLY JOSHUA GEORGE FROM THE 
U. S. A. HE HAS GOT TO PROVE HIMSELF 
ON THE TRACK DAVID WEIR CANNOT BE 
VICTORY NUMBER TWO HE PLAYED WITH 
THE OPPOSITION IN THE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED METRES 
EARLIER ON HE CONTROLLED THE PACE 
AND NOBODY COULD GET PAST HIM HE 
SPRINTED AWAY AT THE FINISH THIS 
WILL NOT BE A TACTICAL RACE DAVID 
WEIR WILL TRY TO GO FLAT OUT LET'S 
SEE WHAT THE TIME WILL BE THIS IS NOT A PARTICULARLY FAST 
TRACK I KNOW THE ATHLETES HAVE 
BEEN SAYING THERE IS A PARTICULAR 
TYPE OF TRACK THEY WOULD LIKE TO 
GET LAID DOWN HERE AND THAT MAY 
HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE DAVID WEIR IS 
BEING PRESSURISED A LITTLE BIT AND 
BY THE CHINESE ATHLETE INSIDE HIM 
BUT HE IS ABSOLUTELY BLASTING DOWN 
THE FIRST TWO HUNDRED METRES OF THIS RACE 
THE OTHER TWO BRITONS ARE OUT OF 
THE PICTURE AT THE MOMENT DAVID WEIR THE RECORD HOLDER THE 
CHINA ATHLETE IS PUTTING PRESSURE 
ON HIM HE HAS GOT TO KEEP HIS LINE 
HERE COMES DAVID WEIR A VICTORY 
NUMBER TWO IN LANE SEVEN THE 
THAILAND ATHLETE GETS THIRD FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN 
SECONDS JUST OUTSIDE HIS 
CHAMPIONSHIP RECORD HE SET LAST 
YEAR BUT WE CAN FOR GIVE HIM THAT 
BECAUSE DAVID WEIR HAS COME HERE IN 
GOOD FORM AND IT IS VICTORY NUMBER 
TWO FOR HIM STILL THE FAVOURED FOR 
THE PARALYMPIC TITLE STILL A WORLD 
RECORD HELD UP AND DEFINITELY 
NUMBER ONE IN MANCHESTER DAVID DAVID WEIR WAS NOT CHALLENGED THE WHOLE 
WAY FOR THIS RACE HE HAD A STRONG 
START AND CAME THROUGH HE IS GOING 
TO BE LOOKING TO WIN FIVE MEDALS IN 
BEIJING FOUR HUNDRED METRES IS AN EVENT HE 
SURELY MUST CONTEST HE IS VERY 
SMOOTH HIS ELBOWS HIGH HE IS SO 
STRONG THROUGH THIS PART OF THE 
RACE AT THIS POINT HE IS ABOUT TWENTY TWO 
M. P. H. A FANTASTIC TIME FOR DAVE WEIR 
THAT WAS INTERESTING IS DAVID JUST 
WHEELED INTO CAMERA SHOT HOW DID 
THAT GO 
YEAH PRETTY WELL L. HAVE 
NOT DONE A FOUR HUNDRED METRE RACE THIS YEAR 
SO IT'S A GOOD TIME FOR THIS TRACK 
YEAH NOT BAD 
YOU LOOK REALLY SHOP 
EVEN IN THE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED METRES EARLY ON 
YOUR SPEED SEEMS TO BE THERE YES YES IT'S THE AMOUNT OF TRAINING WHICH 
IS NOT THERE AT THE MOMENT BEIJING 
IS A LONG TIME AWAY SO THE SPEED 
IS THERE IT'S BEEN THERE ALL 
WINTER BECAUSE I HAD GLANDULAR 
FEVER LAST YEAR I'M TAKING THINGS 
EASILY 
I KNOW YOU'RE BEING A TO EASILY THAT THIS AND ABOUT IT BUT HOW 
MANY MEDALS ARE YOU GOING TO GO FOR 
IN BEIJING I KNOW YOU ARE GOING 
TO BE A LITTLE BIT RETICENT ABOUT 
IT BUT HOW MANY MEDALS ARE YOU 
DON'T GO FOR IN BEIJING 
I WOULD BE 
HAPPY WITH ONE BUT IF I GET MORE 
I GET MORE 
HOW MANY EVENTS ARE YOU 
GOING TO CONTEST 
I HAD ENTERED 
FIVE BUT IT DEPENDS ON MY ILLNESS 
AND STUFF LIKE THAT L. WILL SEE HOW 
I FEEL BEFORE BEIJING AND MAKE A 
DECISION NEARER THE TIME 
WHAT WILL 
INFLUENCE THAT 
SHAPE TRAINING 
MENTAL FITNESS JUST TO SEE HOW 
MENTALLY FIT I AM GOING TO BEIJING 
ALL RIGHT WE WILL LET YOU GET YOUR 
BREATH BACK THE PARALYMPIC WORLD 
CUP HAS BEEN ABOUT FOUR SPORTS BUT 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PARALYMPIC 
WORLD ELSEWHERE IN THE LAST FEW 
WEEKS TENNIS STAR PETER NORFOLK 
HAS HIS SIGHTS SET ON BEIJING HE 
BECAME THE FIRST PARALYMPIC IT 
TENNIS CHAMPION AFTER WINNING 
SILVER IN ATHENS AND IN THE DOUBLES 
HE HAD WONDERFUL VICTORY IN THE 
AUSTRALIAN OPEN HIS NEXT BIG 
CHALLENGE IS THE BRITISH OPEN IN 
NOTTINGHAM IN JULY THEN THE TASK 
OF DEFENDING HIS PARALYMPIC TITLE 
THE BRITONS QUESTION TEAM WON 
FIVE MEDALS IN ATHENS AND THEY WILL 
BE A TEAM TO BEAT EQUESTRIAN TEAM 
LAST YEAR THEY SUCCESSFULLY BEAT 
THEIR DRESSAGE TITLE AND CAME AWAY 
WITH HOST OF INDIVIDUAL TITLES 
LEA PEARSON WAS A THREE TIME 
CHAMPION IN ATHENS AND WILL 
CERTAINLY BE UP FOR SELECTION IN 
JUNE JUNE ROWING MAKES ITS FIRST APPEARANCE 
AT THE PARALYMPICS THIS YEAR AND 
BRITAIN AS GREAT CHANCE TOM A 
DARK IS THE CURRENT WORLD CHAMPION 
FOLLOWING HIS SUCCESS IN MUNICH HE 
ROSE IN POLAND NEXT MONTH 
GREAT BRITAIN WILL COMPETE IN BLIND 
FOOTBALL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
BEIJING THEY QUALIFIED LAST YEAR 
SUCCESS WON'T BE EASY LAST YEAR 
IN HEREFORD THEY WERE BEATEN IN 
TWO FRIENDLY MATCHES IN SPAIN ONE TO ZERO 
THREE TO ZERO YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ABOUT 
THEM ON INSIDE SPORT ON MAY NINETEENTH ON 
B. B. C. ONE ANOTHER GO FIVE O'CLOCK P. M. 
HE WE ARE JOINED BY ANOTHER 
PARALYMPIC CHAMPION WHY AREN'T YOU 
RUNNING 
I HAD A FEW INJURIES OVER RUNNING THE WINTER AND I'M TRYING TO GET 
THEM FIXED READY FOR BEIJING HOW HOW HAVE THINGS BEEN PROGRESSING 
FANTASTIC I HAD A REALLY GOOD 
WINTER AND WAS IN THE BEST SHAPE OF 
MY LIFE OR MAYBE NOT AS I FOUND 
OUT AFTERWARDS A MINOR SETBACK A 
GOOD TIME TO GET OUT OF THE WAY I 
THINK 
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT THINK I HOPE NOT 
I WANT TO TALK TO ABOUT 
NATALIE DU TOIT THE SOUTH AFRICAN 
SWIMMER WHO WENT TO THE OPEN WATER 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS IN SEVILLE AND 
ACTUALLY FINISHED FOURTH AND QUALIFIED 
FOR THE OLYMPICS NOT THE 
PARALYMPICS SHE HAS BEEN HERE THIS 
WEEKEND AS WELL COMPETING YESTERDAY 
THE WORLD MEDIA HAS JUMPED ON THE 
STORY QUITE OBVIOUSLY WHAT ARE 
YOUR VIEWS ON HER ACHIEVEMENTS 
I THINK IT IS FANTASTIC AND IT JUST 
SHOWS THE LEVEL THAT PARALYMPIC 
SPORT HAS GONE TO NOW IT IS 
FANTASTIC FOR THE SPORT TO SHOW 
THAT 
PEOPLE ARE 
PERFORMING AT THE 
HIGHEST LEVEL AND AIMING TO ACHIEVE 
NOT JUST IN THE PARALYMPICS BUT 
THEY ARE SETTING THEIR GOALS TO THE 
OLYMPICS NOW 
DOES THIS DEVALUED 
THAT PARALYMPICS AS SOME HAVE 
SUGGESTED DOES THIS DEVALUE IT IT IS TOUGH BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WON THE 
PARRON KITS TO BECOME THE B. FINAL 
ONE THE PARALYMPICS TO BECOME THE B. 
FINAL IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE HOW 
SHE WILL GET ON SWIMMING AT THE 
OLYMPICS AND 
SHE IS 
VERY COMMITTED 
TO THE PARALYMPICS AS WELL NOW NOW HERE IS A MAN OF OF HIS KEY THE 
PROSTHETICS THEIR OTHER BIG ISSUE 
HERE HERE IS A MAN WHETHER 
PROSTHETICS THEY ARE THE BIG 
ISSUES HERE IF YOU WANT TO 
DELINEATE THE SITUATION BETWEEN 
OSCAR AND NATALIE'S WHAT IS IT 
HE IS RUNNING ON PROSTHETIC LIMB 
HE'S USING TECHNOLOGY TO HELP HIM 
ON HIS WAY THE PROBLEM IS YOU 
CANNOT QUANTIFY WHAT THAT 
TECHNOLOGY GIVES HIM YOU CANNOT 
QUANTIFY HE IS THE ONLY PERSON 
PROBABLY IN PARALYMPIC TERMS HE IS 
CLASS AS HAVING AN ADVANTAGE WHICH 
IS AMAZING BUT THEY CANNOT 
QUANTIFY WHAT THAT ADVANTAGE IS 
WHEN HE IS ON THE TRACK YOU DO NOT 
KNOW HOW MUCH QUICKER HE POSSIBLY 
COULD BE HE DOES COMPETE AGAINST 
EVERYBODY THE PROBLEMS COME WHEN 
HE TRIES TO COMPETE FOR A MEDAL 
WELL WE WILL FIND OUT I GUESS THE 
COURT OF ARBITRATION IS STILL 
WAITING TO JUDGE ON HIS APPEAL WE 
WILL WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH 
BACK WITH THAT LET US REMIND 
YOU THAT THE PARALYMPICS 
ABOUT ABOUT THE PARALYMPICS 
BACK IN MANCHESTER NEXT WEEK IT HAS BEEN A BIG DAY FOR FOOTBALL 
TODAY AS WELL FIND OUT WHO WON 
WHO GOT RELEGATED AS WELL WELL IT 
HAS BEEN A FANTASTIC FIVE DAYS HERE
