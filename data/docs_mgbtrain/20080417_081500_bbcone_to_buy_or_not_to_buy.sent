BASICALLY WHAT I'M SAYING KRISTIAN IS TWO BEDROOMS MAY BE PUSHING IT THE BALCONY COULD 
BE A BIT OF WISHFUL THINKING BUT IF THERE ARE TWO FELLAS THAT CAN PULL THIS OFF IT'S THEE AND ME LAD 
ABSOLUTELY IT WOULD BE AWFUL AS THEY'RE SO IN LOVE 
IF WE END UP BREAKING THEIR HEART 
SO LET'S MARRY THEM TO A PERFECT PLACE I'M WITH YOU 
THE CITY OF MANCHESTER HAS FLOURISHED SINCE THE INDUSTRIAL 
REVOLUTION AND IS NOW REGARDED AS THE THIRD LARGEST CITY IN ENGLAND 
IT'S A VIBRANT MIXTURE OF CULTURE BUSINESS AND SHOPPING WITH A FAMOUSLY FANTASTIC NIGHTLIFE 
AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY LUXURY CITY CENTRE APARTMENTS 
REACHED THE TWO MILLION MARK RATHER MORE THAN OUR BUDGET WILL AFFORD 
SO WHILE I INTRODUCE KRISTIAN TO THE DELIGHTS OF THE NORTH LET'S 
SEE WHAT THEIR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WOULD BUY THEM IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY 
WILL THIS WHET YOUR APPETITE THIS LARGE TWO BEDROOM FLAT IN GLASGOW 
IT'S A CONVERTED NINETEEN THIRTIES ART DECO BUILDING CLOSE TO THE WEST END OF THE CITY 
IT'S ON THE MARKET WITH OFFERS INVITED ABOVE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
YORK IS THE LOCATION OF THIS FINE LOOKING TWO DOUBLE BEDROOMED APARTMENT 
CLOSE TO THE CITY CENTRE AMENITIES AND WITH ALLOCATED PARKING 
IT COULD BE YOURS FOR ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
AND FINALLY HOW ABOUT THIS GENEROUS TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT 
ON THE TOP FLOOR OF THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT IN PORTSMOUTH CITY 
WITH GREAT VIEWS AND SECURE PARKING IT'S WORTH A LOOK AT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
BUT IT'S CENTRAL MANCHESTER WHERE WE'RE CONCENTRATING OUR SEARCH 
CITY CENTRE LIVING REALLY IS BECOMING ALL THE RAGE 
CAFE CULTURE TWENTY FOUR HOUR ENTERTAINMENT AND ALL WITHIN A ONE MILE RADIUS 
BUT WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY LIVE AND WORK HERE THINK ABOUT IT 
BASICALLY I'M OUT SEARCHING FOR A LOVELY COUPLE THEY'RE FIRST TIME BUYERS 
THREE REASONS SNAP 'EM OFF WHY MANCHESTER 
THEY WANT A BIT OF GARDEN SPACE A NICE BALCONY 
NIGHTLIFE MUSIC AND INDIAN FOOD AS WELL 
NOW THEIR BUDGET IS ONE HUNDRED FORTY WE CAN PUSH IT TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
BEST FOOTBALL TEAM IN THE WORLD I'M FROM HERE SO THAT'S A LUCKY REASON 
OH I'M JUST STAYING WITH THIS 
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IT'S A VIBRANT BUZZING CITY WITH EVERYTHING YOU COULD WISH FOR 
NORTHERN QUARTER WISE I'LL STRUGGLE TO GET THEM WHAT THEY WANT IN THAT AREA 
AND THE BARS ARE GREAT THAT'S THREE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
YOU'VE DISAPPOINTED ME WE'VE ONLY CHATTED FOR TWO MINUTES OUTRAGEOUS 
CAN I ASK WHAT CONTEXT YOU'RE PUTTING THAT QUESTION INTO 
A LIVERPUDLIAN ASKING A MANCUNIAN OF COURSE YOU CAN MATE 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY OKEY DOKEY AND TWO BEDROOMS SECURE PARKING 
EVERYONE'S FRIENDLY HERE AND THERE'S A REAL 
SENSE OF COMMUNITY IN THIS AREA OF TOWN SO 
AND IT DOESN'T RAIN ALL THE TIME YEAH YEAH 
GREAT TWO BED IN THE CENTRE OF MANCHESTER 
NO PARKING UNFORTUNATELY BUT A GREAT CORNER PLOT I LIKE THAT 
AND IT COULD HAVE WON THE CITY OF CULTURE BUT LIVERPOOL JUST PIPPED THEM TO THE POST 
GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY THERE'S NO CITY IN THE WORLD LIKE MANCHESTER CHEERS 
IF YOU WHAT MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT IT'S THE PLACE TO BE 
I'LL SPEAK TO YOU LATER ON CHEERS BYE 
I KNOW KRISTIAN THINKS I'M AN OLD FUDDY DUDDY 
RIGHT I NEED TO GET A LIFT WITH A BUS 
WELL MORE FOOL HIM COS I'VE FOUND A FASHIONABLE BAR HERE IN THE NORTHERN QUARTER WITH WIFI WIRELESS 
INTERNET CONNECTION TO TAKE THE LEG WORK OUT OF MY PROPERTY SEARCH 
ALL RIGHT I'VE CHECKED OUT THIS AREA I'VE JUST GOTTA CATCH THE BUS 
FOR THE WILD CARD I FOUND AN ABSOLUTE CORKER HERE ENOUGH SAID 
ALTHOUGH I'LL SAY THIS MUCH 
WILD IT CERTAINLY IS 
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW OF ANY APARTMENTS FOR SALE 
THERE IS NOT ONE FOR SALE SIGN 
THIS HAS BEEN TOUGH WITH COMPETITION FOR PROPERTIES IN THE CITY CENTRE FIERCE 
BUT WE HAVE RISEN TO THE CHALLENGE TIME TO SHOW OUR HANDS 
WE HAVE EVENTUALLY COMPLETED OUR PROPERTY SEARCH AND HAPPILY CHOSEN THREE THAT WE LOVE 
BUT SOME CHOICES ARE CONTROVERSIAL 
NOT WITH MINE PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
I'VE GONE FOR SOMETHING BESPOKE CONSERVATIVE ALMOST WHAT THEY ASKED FOR 
AND ALSO IN THE DESIRED LOCATION UNLIKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CHOICES 
LOOKING AT YOUR DRESS SENSE I WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT YOU WERE THAT CONSERVATIVE 
RESORTING TO CHEAP JIBES 
FOR MY FIRST PROPERTY I'VE GONE FOR A MIX OF THE OLD WITH THE NEW YES 
AND O. K. IT'S NOT IN THE RIGHT LOCATION BUT I HAVE CONCENTRATED ON SPACE 
I'LL GIVE THEM SPACE FOR THEIR BUDGET 
I KNOW WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF SPACE 
PROPERTY NUMBER THREE THE WILD CARD THINGS HAVE GOT 
A BIT CONTROVERSIAL A BIT OUT OF HAND BECAUSE OF SIR HERE 
KRISTIAN YOU'RE TWISTING MY MELON MAN I DO HOPE NOT 
THIS IS A FANTASTIC PROPERTY 
O. K. IT'S NOT OUR USUAL KIND OF WILD CARD IT'S NOT OUR USUAL KIND OF PROPERTY 
BUT IT'S FABULOUS IT'S OUT THERE ADVENTUROUS 
I'M NOT CONVINCED YOU CAN JUDGE FOR YOURSELF LATER 
BUT FIRST OF ALL LET'S COMMENCE THE VIEWINGS AT PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
AND PROPERTY ONE IS MY CHOICE AND I THINK I'M RIGHT ON TARGET 
IT'S A ONE BEDROOM THIRD FLOOR FLAT IN THE HEART OF THE NORTHERN QUARTER 
IT'S ONLY TWO YEARS OLD AND FEELS REALLY LIGHT AND SPACIOUS 
IT'S SURROUNDED BY SHOPS BARS AND RESTAURANTS TOO 
PERFECT FOR OUR YOUNG BUYERS IT'S LOOKING PROMISING KRISTIAN 
AND THERE'S ALSO A SURPRISE IN STORE 
CLAIRE AND JOHN I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT FOR ANY INSTANCE 
ANY PART OF THIS APARTMENT FINDING MISSION WAS EASY AT ALL BECAUSE FRANKLY IT WASN'T 
IT'S BEEN VERY PAINFUL VERY TRICKY INDEED 
AND I'VE HAD A LOOK ROUND THIS AREA THAT YOU REALLY LIKE AND 
I CAN SEE WHY YOU LIKE IT IT'S A VERY NICE AREA 
BUT ARE YOU STILL REALLY KEEN ON IT COS IT IS PRICEY 
WE ARE AREN'T WE YEAH WE LIKE IT REALLY COS YOU LIVE RIGHT THERE 
YEAH YES THAT'S KIND OF HELPFUL BECAUSE PROPERTY ONE MY CHOICE IS IN THAT APARTMENT THERE 
THAT WAS A LONG WALK WASN'T IT 
I'M EXHAUSTED CAN'T CARRY ON WHAT DO YOU THINK 
VERY NICE I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE A LOOK IN THERE 
WELL NOW'S YOUR CHANCE NOW WE CAN HAVE A LOOK 
OBVIOUSLY THERE HAS TO BE A COUPLE OF COMPROMISES YOU KNOW THIS WITH THE BUDGET WE ARE WORKING ON 
SO KRISTIAN'S CHOICE IS ONLY ONE BEDROOM 
BUT APART FROM THAT I WILL SAY NO MORE 
GO AND HAVE A LOOK ROUND 
YOU WEREN'T TRYING TO PUT THEM OFF THAT WERE YOU 
NO WOULD I DO THAT KRISTIAN WOULD I OFF WITH YOUR HEAD 
RIGHT SIMON HEADPHONES ON LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THEY MAKE OF THIS RATHER NICE APARTMENT 
NICE NICE 
NICE WOOD FLOOR 
YEP VERY NICE 
AS FAR AS FLOOR COVERINGS GO I LIKE THAT HALLWAY DO YOU 
IT'S ONE STEP UP FROM LAMINATE AND I THINK IT'S 
REALLY WORTH INVESTING IN THAT EXTRA LITTLE BIT 
IF YOU'RE HAPPY I'M HAPPY 
NICE BATHROOM IN'T IT 
BATHROOM VERY IMPORTANT ROOM 
THAT'S NICE IN'T IT ACTUALLY THE BATH 
IT IS QUITE DARK IN HERE ISN'T IT FOR A BATH 
I LIKE BATHROOMS BEING DARK I HAVE A FEW TEA LIGHTS FOAM IN THE TUB 
I'M THE OPPOSITE I'M THE OPPOSITE I LIKE DAYLIGHT IN A BATHROOM 
BUT YOU WON'T GET THAT WITH CITY CENTRE LIVING 
IT'S VERY RARE TO FIND NATURAL LIGHT IN A BATHROOM 
IT'S NICE THOUGH IT'S A LOT LIKE OURS YOU COULD PUT AN EXTRA LIGHT IN 
COS I'D IMAGINE A BIT OF DAYLIGHT ON YOU AND YOU'D BE 
THAT REMINDS ME FANCY COMING ROUND TO OURS FOR A BITE TONIGHT 
READY NECK 
OH IT'S NICE IN HERE IT IS NICE AND AIRY VERY LIGHT 
WHAT THEY'VE GOT IS GORGEOUS FLOOR TO CEILING GLASS WINDOWS 
IT IS IT'S REALLY LOVELY LIGHT SPACE YEAH 
THAT'S YOUR LIGHT AGAIN IT IS YOU SEE 
LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT THAT'S REALLY TINY 
WHAT'S TINY WHAT'S TINY THESE ELECTRIC HEATERS 
THAT'S BETTER WELL I LIKE THOSE SMALL HEATERS 
THEY'RE VERY COMPACT AND BIJOU YOU HAVEN'T GOT ACRES OF RADIATOR EATING UP YOUR WALL 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK IN HERE YOU COULD HAVE STOOLS UNDER THERE INSTEAD OF THAT AND HAVE MORE ROOM 
I UNDERSTAND WHY CLAIRE LIKES LIVING IN THE NORTHERN QUARTER 
SHE WANTS A BREAKFAST BAR NOW 
SHE'S GETTING VERY FANCY POSH VERY TRENDY 
HAS IT GOT A DISHWASHER LET ME HAVE A NOSY 
NO NO DISHWASHER 
O. K. THAT KITCHEN HASN'T GOT A DISHWASHER BUT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOME PART TIME WORK 
WHAT'S IN HERE 
OH A WASHING MACHINE 
OH I WONDERED WHERE THAT WAS THAT'S ALL RIGHT 
A BIG STORAGE CUPBOARD AT THE BACK OF THE KITCHEN IT'S HUGE 
WHAT'S THIS THIS IS THE BEDROOM 
VERY NICE 
I MAY HAVE SHORT CHANGED THEM A BIT IN THAT IT'S ONLY A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT 
BUT IT IS A REALLY HEALTHY SIZED APARTMENT IT IS 
I'M NOT TOO KEEN ON IT SO NEAR THIS THOUGH 
OH I LIKE THE DOOR YOU'D HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE KITCHEN 
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUT A DIFFERENT DOOR IN 
LIKE THE HEAVIER ONES COS THAT MIGHT SMELL 
I KNOW IF YOU'RE COOKING SOMETHING IN THERE 
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN IF YOU'RE COOKING SOMETHING STEAMY 
SOMETHING STEAMY WHAT BOILED RICE 
THEY'RE EXOTIC THEY'RE GETTING STEAMY IN THE KITCHEN 
OR SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA BURN STEAK OR SOMETHING 
ARE YOU SAYING I BURN THINGS 
YEAH CAN YOU IMAGINE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT A WALL 
I'D WANNA PUT A WALL AT THE FRONT OF THAT KITCHEN TO SEPARATE IT OFF 
NO 
AND YOUR CLOTHES AND STUFF WILL SMELL IN THIS SECTION 
THEY DON'T LIKE MY SLIDING DOOR PLENTY OF ROOM FOR WARDROBES 
MOVE IT OVER A BIT I THINK YOU NEED 
I'D NEED A BIGGER WARDROBE DEFINITELY 
THEY'RE SOUNDING BUOYANT THEY ARE 
THEY'RE ALREADY REDESIGNING WHERE THE FURNITURE WILL GO 
AND DOORS THAT'S POSITIVE 
GREAT VERY NICE VERY NICE 
THE SLIDING DOOR MAY BE OUT BUT LET'S FIND OUT IF 
THEY COULD SLIP COMFORTABLY INTO THIS APARTMENT RIGHT 
CLAIRE WHY DO YOU THINK I'M TREATING YOU TO A NICE SLAP UP LUNCH I DON'T KNOW 
WELL I'M NOT TRYING TO APOLOGISE FOR THE FACT THAT I ONLY OFFERED YOU A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT 
I'M REINFORCING THE FACT AND YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS 
THAT THE AREA YOU'RE ALREADY RENTING ACROSS THE STREET IS A FANTASTIC AREA O. K. 
IF YOU WERE TO BUY YOUR ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT NOW 
I'M SURE THAT IN A COUPLE OF YEARS DOWN THE LINE WITHOUT ANY DOUBT 
THAT YOU ARE GOING TO SELL THAT AND MAKE A PROFIT 
YEAH THAT WILL ENABLE YOU TO MOVE UP THE PROPERTY LADDER 
YEP I THINK THIS IS A REALLY REALLY FANTASTIC AREA TO MAKE MONEY 
YEAH THAT DOES MAKE SENSE YEAH DEFINITELY 
YEAH AND WHAT TASTES EVEN BETTER THAN ALL OF THAT IS THIS 
ONE OF THESE 
THERE'S NO ELEGANT WAY OF EATING THESE 
I DUNNO WHETHER YOU AGREE BUT A LOT OF NEW BUILD APARTMENTS 
REALLY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO SQUEEZE THEM INTO A SMALL SPACE 
YEAH I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN 
AND YOU DON'T REALLY FEEL THAT WITH THIS APARTMENT DO YOU NO 
FOR EXAMPLE THIS HALL SPACE HERE YOU KNOW I CAME WALTZING IN 
LIKE YOU DID AND WENT STRAIGHT PAST IT BUT 
THIS IS IT'S A GREAT AREA ISN'T IT YEAH 
AND IF YOU KNOW O. K. ON THIS BUDGET YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET AN OFFICE 
BUT HERE IT IS HERE'S YOUR OFFICE SPACE THIS CORNER 
PLENTY OF SHELVING UP HERE 
RATHER THIS CORNER THAN THAT CORNER 
FINE BUT ALL I'M SAYING IS THERE ARE SPARE SPACES IN HERE 
YEAH BUT OF COURSE ALL THIS SPACE 
WHAT DOES IT COST 
SHALL WE GO AND FIND THE OTHERS 
WHAT DO YOU BOTH THINK WE LIKE IT 
I WANNA MOVE IN BUT THERE'S NO SECOND BEDROOM SO I CAN'T 
BUT I REALLY LIKE IT 
OH WELL DON'T GUSH WITH ENTHUSIASM GUYS NO WE LIKE IT DON'T WE 
LIKE WE SAID THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT WE WOULD MAYBE CHANGE ABOUT IT BUT 
I WAS TAKEN WITH GETTING RID OF THAT SLIDING DOOR THOUGH 
YEAH I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE WAY TO GO WOULDN'T IT 
AND HE'S GOT ALL HIS DIY STUFF 
EXACTLY WE'VE ALREADY GOT IT SHALL WE START TO GUESS THE PRICE YES 
SO MONEY YES GUESS THE PRICE 
WHO'S GONNA GO FIRST 
YOU CAN ME 
YEAH COME ON 
I RECKON A B. O. U. T. ONE THIRTY NINE 
O. K. ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE 
CLAIRE I'M GONNA GO BIT HIGHER COS 
I THINK IT'S QUITE NEW THIS ONE 
SO I'M GONNA GO A BIT HIGHER AND SAY ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
RIGHTY HO 
KRISTIAN 
O. K. 
RIGHT THE PRICE IS FIFTY QUID SHORT OF YOUR BUDGET IT'S ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
YOU SEE HE DRESSES IN SUCH A TATTY MANNER BUT HE DOES ACTUALLY HAVE 
HE ACTUALLY HAS VERY EXPENSIVE TASTES 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA BE SPOT ON THERE YOU GO 
REAL VALUE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE MARKET VALUE MINUS ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THAT'S GOT YOU PENSIVE 
THE TROUBLE WITH KRISTIAN HE'S GOT NO EYE FOR A BARGAIN I HAVE COME WITH ME PROPERTY TWO 
IF CLAIRE AND JOHN GO FOR PROPERTY ONE THERE ARE A FEW THINGS TO CONSIDER 
CITY CENTRE LIVING HAS LOTS TO OFFER BUT WITH 
TWENTY FOUR HOUR LICENSING LAWS AND THE REVITALISING OF INNER CITY AREAS CITIES CAN BE NOISY 
SO IT'S WORTH INVESTIGATING BY VISITING THE LOCAL AREAS AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF DAY AND NIGHT 
THIS IS VERY MODERN LESS THAN TWO YEARS OLD 
MANY NEW FLATS HAVE CONDITIONS APPLIED TO TENANTS 
TO MAINTAIN THE LOOK AND QUALITY OF THE BUILDING 
ALWAYS CHECK TO SEE IF NEW OWNERS ARE BOUND BY ANY LEGAL CONDITIONS 
PROPERTY NUMBER TWO IS MY CHOICE AND A VERY HANDSOME PROPERTY IT IS TOO 
IT'S A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT IN THIS CONVERTED MILL NEAR THE CITY CENTRE 
IT'S GOT AN OPEN PLAN FEEL WITH ALL THE STORAGE SPACE CLAIRE AND JOHN NEED 
IT ALSO HAS BAGS OF POTENTIAL FOR THEM TO PUT THEIR OWN STAMP ON IT 
IT IS A GOOD FIND BUT IT IS FURTHER OUT FROM THE CITY CENTRE THAN CLAIRE AND JOHN WANTED 
ARE THEY ARE OPEN MINDED ENOUGH 
LET'S FIND OUT SHALL WE MR. DIGBY 
JOHN CLAIRE 
PROPERTY NUMBER TWO MY CHOICE 
NOW WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY IN THE NORTHERN QUARTER ANY MORE 
NO BUT DON'T LET THAT PUT YOU OFF WE'RE ONLY A STONE'S THROW FROM TOWN 
LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL BUILDING FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
NICE IT'S A VERY NICE ATTRACTIVE BUILDING 
IT'S A GORGEOUS CONVERSION OF AN OLD MILL HOUSE AND ITS LOVELY INDUSTRIAL MACHINE BRICKS 
IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE 
REALLY NICE ACTUALLY 
WHAT I'VE COMPROMISED IN LOCATION I GUARANTEE I HAVE MADE UP FOR IN SPACE 
WHAT ARE WE A BUNCH OF TREKKIES 
WHAT HE IS GIVING YOU HERE SPACE BEING THE FINAL FRONTIER 
IS IN A CERTAIN APARTMENT HE HAS PICKED FOR YOU HAVE A LOOK COME ON THEN 
WHAT NO I WAS IMPRESSED BY YOUR WORKMANSHIP VERY GOOD WHAT 
O. K. LET'S FIND OUT IF I'VE PLANTED THEM IN THE RIGHT PLACE FLOOR'S NICE IN'T IT 
THOSE ORIGINAL WOODEN FLOORS ARE GORGEOUS 
I DON'T LIKE THAT AT ALL 
YOU COULD CHANGE THE BATH THOUGH 
THERE ARE SOME REALLY NICE PIECES IN THERE THEY'VE GOT THE LOVELY OLD ORIGINAL CISTERN 
I WONDER WHAT THAT IS IT'S JUST A PILLAR 
IT'S QUITE BIG I THINK THAT BATHROOM IS SUCH A GRAND SIZE 
FAR BIGGER THAN YOU NORMALLY SEE IN A CONVERSION LIKE THIS 
IT'S PALATIAL PALATIAL 
YOU COULD DO A BIT WITH IT YEAH 
THE DECOR IS A BIT TIRED IT NEEDS MODERNISING 
IT'S USABLE IT'S FINE BUT IT HASN'T GOT 
THE GLOSS OF THE PROPERTY THAT I'VE SHOWN THEM OR THE EMULSION 
THIS IS QUITE BIG ISN'T IT 
NICE SIZE NICE FLOOR 
IT IS NICE 
THE KITCHEN'S A BIT 
FAKE SHAKER 
A FAKE SHAKER SOUNDS LIKE A TERRIBLE DATE OR A BAD DANCE 
IT'S BIG THERE'S LOADS MORE STORAGE THAN THAT OTHER ONE 
LOOK AT ALL CUPBOARDS IT'S NOT THE NICEST KITCHEN IN THE WORLD 
THE KITCHEN UNITS ARE WISHY WASHY REPLACE THE DOORS AND DO SOMETHING MORE EXCITING THERE 
LOOK AT THIS FLOOR I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS 
OH YEAH FAKE TILES ISN'T IT YOU COULD CHANGE THAT COULDN'T YOU 
CLAIRE HAS HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD I DIDN'T BANGING 
THEY CAN CHANGE THAT AH YES 
THINK THAT'S REAL 
THAT'S JUST A LITTLE ELECTRIC THING ISN'T IT 
I LIKE THAT I THINK THAT'S QUITE SWEET 
WHAT IS IT GAS OR ELECTRIC 
ELECTRIC 
I'D TAKE THAT OUT YOU'D HAVE TO TAKE THAT OUT AS WELL 
JOHN IS OBVIOUSLY NOT A FAN OF THE COAL LOOK GAS FIRE 
WHAT'S THIS BEDROOM YEAH 
NOW THEY'LL START GOING FOR THIS PLACE THEY'VE FOUND ONE BEDROOM 
THERE IS ROOM FOR A SINGLE BED 
YOU WOULDN'T GET A DOUBLE BED IN HERE 
I LIKE THE FLOORS 
THEY LIKE THE FLOORS THEY DO 
AND THOSE FLOORS ARE ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS 
IT'S A PITY THERE WASN'T JUST A BIT MORE OF THAT THOUGHT THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE DECORATING 
THEY LOOK NICE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS IF THIS IS THE ONLY BEDROOM 
NO JOHN IT'S NOT THE ONLY BEDROOM OPEN ALL DOORS 
WELL THERE WAS ANOTHER DOOR THERE 
LET'S GO LOOK AT THAT ONE AS WELL O. K. 
THEY THINK IT'S A BIT SMALL 
BUT IT'S A SINGLE BEDROOM IT'S YOUR GUEST BEDROOM 
SIMON THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH SMALL IS THERE 
AH 
THIS IS BIGGER ISN'T IT THINK WE'D FIT OUR BED IN HERE 
NO IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE THAT WARDROBE'S SO BIG AND WE'RE NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE IT PROPERLY 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'D FITTED IN YOU WOULDN'T 
KRISTIAN I'M NOT GETTING A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THIS NO 
BUT IT IS NICE THOUGH IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO NICE I KNOW 
IT'S GOT REALLY NICE FEATURES THE BRICKS 
THE TWO BEST SELLING FEATURES OF THIS PROPERTY 
ARE THE STRIPPED FLOOR BOARDS AND THE BARE BRICK WALLS 
THE REST IS INCIDENTAL AND I WOULD BASICALLY REDECORATE COMPLETELY 
I'M NOT AS KEEN ON THIS AS THE OTHER ONE ARE YOU 
NO EVEN THOUGH THE OTHER ONE THE LOUNGE WAS SMALLER AND STUFF 
I PREFER THE OTHER ONE YEAH BUT IF YOU COULD MIX ASPECTS OF BOTH 
THEN IT WOULD BE PERFECT YEAH 
BUT THE BEDROOM WAS MUCH BETTER IN THE OTHER ONE 
THAT'S TERRIBLE SIMON I THINK THEY PREFER MINE OVER YOURS THAT'S TERRIBLE 
I THINK THEY JUST SAID IF YOU COULD MIX ASPECTS OF BOTH 
BUT YOU CAN'T NO 
SO THEY PREFER MINE COME ON THEN 
RIGHT ABOUT NOW YOU SHOULD BE EMITTING AN S. O. S. SIGNAL 
BECAUSE YOU NEED EVERY BIT OF HELP YOU CAN GET 
THAT'S NOT FAIR YOU'RE GOING TO HELP ME OUT HERE 
UH HUH HE'S NOT 
JOHN I'VE BEEN DRAFTED IN TO SALVAGE THIS DESPERATE SITUATION 
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T SEEM THAT KEEN 
NOT TOO KEEN TO BE HONEST NO 
GIVE ME SOME OF YOUR WOES 
APART FROM THE BEAUTIFUL KITCHEN 
THE DADO RAIL SKIRTING BOARD THE ELECTRIC HEATER 
THE LOVELY BLINDS THE WHITE P. V. C. WINDOWS 
AND THE SIZE OF THE BEDROOM YES 
THAT'S QUITE A LIST FRANKLY SKIRTING BOARDS AND DADO RAILS 
THAT DADO RAIL CAN GO NOT A BIG PROBLEM BLINDS COME DOWN EASY 
THE BIGGER PROBLEMS THE MORE SERIOUS ONES ARE THE SIZE OF THE BEDROOMS 
HERE'S AN IDEA IT'S A STUD WALL 
VERY THIN IF YOU PULL IT OUT TO HERE SO IT JUST CUTS OFF THAT WINDOW 
THAT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE A LOT OF SPACE THERE BUT IT WILL MAKE THAT BEDROOM FEEL BIGGER 
MOVING THIS WAY IF WE HEAD TO THE FAKER SHAKER I THINK WERE YOUR WORDS O. K. 
IT MAY NOT BE YOUR TASTE YOU CAN REPLACE THOSE DOORS AND GET A NEW WORKTOP 
I THINK THE WHOLE THING NEEDS COMING OFF 
IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT YOU CAN DO THAT THIS WAY 
AND INTO THE BATHROOM HERE YOU WERE ALMOST LOST FOR WORDS WHEN YOU FIRST SAW THIS 
THE DECOR 
IT NEEDS A LOT OF WORK DOING TO IT 
I'D SLIDE THAT LOO OVER THERE 
YOU'VE THEN GOT A NICE GAP BETWEEN THE LOO AND THE BATH YOUR SINK'S FINE WHERE IT IS 
THEN OVER HERE HOW ABOUT A NICE WALK IN SHOWER 
YEAH DEFINITELY NOT A BAD IDEA 
ALSO VERY EASY TO DO BECAUSE YOU JUST CONNECT THE PLUMBING UP WITH THE PLUMBING OF THE BATH 
SIMPLE SO LESS OF THE NEGATIVITY AND MORE OF THE POSITIVITY ALSO START THINKING ABOUT THE PRICE 
THERE'S ONE OTHER BIT OF THIS BUILDING I WANT TO POINT OUT 
THAT IS SOMETHING YOU REALLY CAN'T SEE 
THERE IS A SENSE OF COMMUNITY HERE 
AND THAT MANIFESTED ITSELF WHEN A PLOT OF LAND CAME UP FOR SALE FROM THE MANAGEMENT 
AND THEY ALL CLUBBED TOGETHER TO BUY IT TO CREATE THEIR OWN PARKING FACILITY 
OH YEAH 
TO JOIN IN IN THAT WAY AND GET A REAL COMMUNITY SPIRIT GOING IS A RARE THING THESE DAYS 
THAT'S REALLY GOOD AND THAT IS WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HERE 
SO YOU CAN'T REALLY PUT A VALUE TO THAT 
BUT YOU CERTAINLY CAN ON THE PARKING DEFINITELY 
SO HOW MUCH VALUE WOULD IT ADD WHO KNOWS SHALL WE GO AND FIND OUT 
YES LET'S JOIN THE OTHERS 
WELL CLAIRE AND JOHN WASN'T THAT AN EXTRAORDINARY TOUR 
IT WAS IT WAS YOU'RE SAYING NOTHING JOHN 
STILL SPEECHLESS WE'LL KEEP IT THAT WAY 
ACTUALLY NOT FOR LONG I WISH HE WAS SPEECHLESS 
IT IS NOW GUESS THE PRICE TIME 
CLAIRE WAS CLOSEST LAST TIME 
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY GOT THE IN DEPTH KNOWLEDGE 
GO ON 
I'M GOING TO GO HIGHER THAN LAST TIME BECAUSE IT'S GOT TWO BEDROOMS I RECKON IT'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
O. K. ONE HUNDRED FIFTY JOHN 
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE OR THE SAME PRICE AS THE LAST ONE 
I CAN'T CLOSE THIS 
WELL IN ACTUAL FACT CLAIRE IS OBVIOUSLY THE PROPERTY EXPERT AMONGST YOU COS IT'S TWO TO ZERO TO CLAIRE 
THIS IS ON THE MARKET FOR ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
TWO BEDROOMS 
YOU DON'T HATE IT SO MUCH NOW DO YOU YOU DO DON'T YOU 
IT COULD HAVE REDEEMED ITSELF A LITTLE BIT IT HAS A LITTLE BIT 
I THINK YOU QUITE LIKE THIS I LIKE SOME OF THE FEATURES 
BUT IF I'M PERFECTLY HONEST I'M NOT KEEN ON THE BEDROOMS 
WHY DON'T WE USE JOHN'S FAVOURITE FEATURE NOW THE DOOR AND LOOK AT THE WILD CARD 
PROPERTY THREE THIS WAY 
IF THIS PROPERTY MAKES AN IMPACT ON CLAIRE AND JOHN THERE ARE FEW THINGS THEY NEED TO BEAR IN MIND 
THIS PLACE AS LOADS OF POTENTIAL 
BUT CONVERSIONS NEED CAREFUL CONSIDERATION 
THE LARGE COURTYARD AND COMMUNAL AREAS COULD BE SUBJECT TO SERVICE CHARGES 
AND DEPENDING ON THE AREA YOUR COUNCIL TAX MAY ALSO RISE MUCH HIGHER THAN YOU EXPECT 
CHECK ALL THIS OUT BEFORE PUTTING IN THE OFFER 
THE LOCAL PARKING MAKES THIS A GREAT CONTENDER FOR CLAIRE AND JOHN 
BUT THIS IS NOT IN THE SALES DETAILS FOR THE FLAT 
IF A MAJOR SELLING POINT SUCH AS THIS IS NOT MENTIONED 
BY A VENDOR OR ESTATE AGENT ALWAYS GET CONFIRMATION IN WRITING 
TIME FOR THE WILD CARD AND THIS ONE'S WILD FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS 
NOT LEAST FOR THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT YET BUILT 
IT'S AN APARTMENT IN A STATE OF THE ART DEVELOPMENT IN A FANTASTIC CITY CENTRE LOCATION 
OR IT WILL BE 
THE ARCHITECT'S DRAWING OF THE BUILDING SHOWS A GROUND BREAKING PODULAR DESIGN 
THE ACTUAL BUILDING SITE IS WORK IN PROGRESS AND WE'LL BE BRINGING CLAIRE AND JOHN HERE LATER 
FIRST THERE'S A MOCK UP OF ONE OF THE FLATS LOCATED IN A WAREHOUSE IN ANOTHER PART OF TOWN 
HERE'S WHERE OUR SCIENTISTS BECOME EXPERIMENTAL GUINEA PIGS 
IT'S CRUCIAL THEY ARE OPEN MINDED 
SO WE'VE BLINDFOLDED THEM AND THEY DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE VIEWING 
WE'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE HONESTLY 
WATCH THE STEP SORRY MATE 
HE'S VERY GOOD AT THIS ISN'T HE 
IN YOU GO WATCH YOUR STEP 
COME WITH ME COME WITH ME THERE YOU GO 
STAY THERE MATE STAND STEADY 
AND CLAIRE I ASSURE YOU YOU'RE NEXT TO JOHN 
NOW COUNT TO FIVE AND TAKE YOUR BLINDFOLD OFF 
BUT WHEN YOU DO THAT EXPLORE THE SPACE IT'S VERY UNCONVENTIONAL 
KEEP AN OPEN MIND ALL RIGHT 
O. K. COUNT DOWN WHEN YOU HEAR THE DOOR CLOSE 
THREE QUICK SIMON 
TWO QUICK AS YOU CAN ONE 
MADNESS 
I HOPE THEY'RE DOING CARTWHEELS OVER THIS PLACE 
I'M TOO EXCITED BLINDFOLDS ARE COMING OFF 
WHERE ARE WE 
RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE NO IDEA THAT THEY'RE BASICALLY IN A WOODEN BOX 
WOW LOOK 
THAT IS THE WHOLE IDEA OF A SPACE LIKE THIS 
THAT THE POD IS SO A BRILLIANTLY DESIGNED EVERYTHING YOU NEED IS CONCEALED 
WHAT THIS DESIGN HAS DONE IS MAXIMISE SPACE TO A DEGREE THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE 
BLIMEY THIS IS HEAVY 
OH YEAH WHAT IS IT I DUNNO 
OH YEAH 
HOW GOOD IS THAT THAT'S QUITE NICE 
DEFINITELY USED THE SPACE WELL 
YEAH DEFINITELY 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT 
THEY HAVE USED IT WELL YEAH 
THEY'RE ALREADY STARTING TO GET INTO THE CONCEPT AREN'T THEY 
LET'S JUST LEAVE IT 
JUST IN CASE THAT'S QUITE GOOD ISN'T IT 
IT'S MAGIC ISN'T IT IT'S LIKE AN ILLUSIONIST'S TRICK 
IT IS THINGS APPEARING AND DISAPPEARING 
ANOTHER BIT OF STORAGE LET'S SEE WHAT THIS ONE IS 
OH IT'S THAT SAME ONE ISN'T IT 
IT'S THE WASHING MACHINE 
OH YEAH OH YEAH YEAH YEAH 
I'M ACTUALLY TRYING NOT TO GIGGLE 
THEY STILL HAVEN'T WORKED OUT THEY'RE JUST IN A CARDBOARD BOX IT'S FANTASTIC 
THEY ARE LIKE OUR LITTLE PET GUINEA PIGS IT IS SMALLER 
IT'S NICE BUT IT IS NICE 
THAT IS TRUE THIS IS A LOT SMALLER 
BUT DON'T YOU WORRY KRISTIAN 
DO I LOOK WORRIED I HAVE ONE MORE TRICK UP MY SLEEVE ON THIS ONE 
WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS SHOW THEM AN APARTMENT WHICH IS 
BIGGER WITH A BIGGER BALCONY 
WITHIN THEIR BUDGET WITHIN THEIR BUDGET NICE 
BUT THAT WOULD 
YOU COULDN'T DO ANY 
COOKING ON THAT IF YOU HAD THAT 
YOU WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT 
SHORT 
ON ROOM 
BUT IT'S GOT A BALCONY 
THEY HAVE NOT COMMENTED THAT THEIR VIEW FROM THE BALCONY IS 
THE INSIDE OF A WAREHOUSE I FIND THAT CURIOUS 
IF I LOOKED OUT AND SAW THE INTERIOR OF A WAREHOUSE I'D BE ASKING QUESTIONS 
PERHAPS THE VIEW IS NOT THAT IMPORTANT OR THE BALCONY 
THEY'VE THE SPACE REALLY WELL HAVEN'T THEY 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY ARE NOT QUESTIONING THE VIEW GO SEE THEM 
ARE YOU NOT QUESTIONING THE VIEW 
ARE YOU NOT CURIOUS ABOUT THE VIEW 
OH YEAH THE VIEW YES 
YOU'RE STRANGE 
STRANGE BUNCH 
COME ON LET'S GO THROUGH THIS WAY NOW LET'S LOOK AT IT 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
UM IT IS NICE BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THE OVEN IS SMALL 
TOILET AND A SHOWER NO BATH 
THE CLEVEREST THING ABOUT THE USE OF SPACE IS WHEN YOU OPEN THE TWO DOORS TO THE BATHROOM 
THEY LOCK IN PLACE AND YOU GET A MUCH BIGGER SPACE IN THE BATHROOM 
IT PULLS OUT INTO A ROOM IT IS 
DEFINITELY CLEVER SHALL WE USE THE WORD GENIUS 
I PREFER EITHER OF THE OTHER TWO 
EVEN THE SECOND ONE WAS A BIT IT NEEDED A LOT OF WORK DOING TO IT 
THAT'S A DOUBLE GUT PUNCH NOT ONLY IS HE BEING NEGATIVE ABOUT THIS HE IS ALSO SLANDERING NUMBER TWO 
I DON'T KNOW IT'S A BIT WOODY MDFY FOR ME 
IT FEELS VERY MDFY 
THAT MEANS THAT IS LAURENCE LLEWELLYN BOWEN'S DREAM HOUSE 
I SEE WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO PUT AS MUCH SPACE LIKE THOSE LITTLE PODS THEY'VE GOT IN JAPAN 
TO MAXIMISE SPACE ALL YOU CAN DO TO IT PAINT IT 
I'M GOING TO HAVE A WORD WITH JOHN LET'S DO IT 
YOU REALLY HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS ABOUT THIS KIND OF SPACE 
IT COULD BE A BIT CLAUSTROPHOBIC OVER A PERIOD OF TIME 
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT I CAN HELP YOU ON BOTH OF THOSE COUNTS IN A MOMENT 
BUT JUST TO GET OUR HEADS ROUND WHAT THIS IS ABOUT 
WHAT THE DESIGNER IS DOING HERE IS TRYING TO BRING 
HIGH CONCEPT LIVING RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY WHICH I KNOW IS REALLY WHERE YOU WANT TO BE 
AT WITHOUT GIVING TOO MUCH AWAY A VERY AFFORDABLE PRICE ALL RIGHT 
AND FURTHERMORE IF WE POP OUT HERE I'LL SHOW YOU WHY 
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THE QUALITY OF FINISH IS NOT THAT GOOD 
IT'S ONLY A MOCK UP 
IT'S JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE STYLE OF THESE PODS 
COME ON LET'S GO AND FIND YOUR GOOD LADY FOR ONE MORE SURPRISE BEFORE YOU GUESS THE PRICE 
JOHN SEEMED WEIRDLY UNFAZED BY THE MOCK UP OF THE FLAT AND LACK OF VIEW 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN I'VE BROUGHT CLAIRE TO THE ACTUAL SITE AND A MUCH LARGER FLAT WITH A VIEW 
NOW CLAIRE SOMETHING QUITE SPECIAL FOR YOU BECAUSE WE 
HAVE GOT PERMISSION TO COME ON THE SITE MID CONSTRUCTION 
WE'RE NOT SHOWING YOU ONE OF THOSE VERY SMALL PODS 
WE ARE SHOWING YOU A LARGER ONE ALMOST TWICE THE SIZE 
OKAY FIRST IMPRESSIONS WHAT YOU MAKE OF THIS 
UM IT IS OBVIOUSLY A LOT BIGGER AND THE VIEW OBVIOUSLY IS A LOT BETTER THAN THE OTHER ONE 
THE VIEW IS BRILLIANT LET ME TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE LAYOUT FIRST 
COME OVER HERE 
THIS IS WHERE YOUR FOLD UP BED IS GOING TO GO SO IT'S DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF LAYOUT 
THIS IS WHAT YOU'LL LOVE IF WE PULL DOWN HERE INSIDE 
THE POD UNLIKE THE OTHER ONE YOU HAVE GOT YOURSELF A PROPER BATHROOM 
IT'S NOT JUST A SHOWER YOU'VE GOT A BATH TUB 
YOU SEE THAT PANEL THERE 
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE BATH YOU LET THAT APERTURE DOWN 
AND IT IS PERFECT FOR THE EYE LINE YOU CAN LOOK OUT ON TO THE VIEW 
THAT'S BRILLIANT WE LIKE THAT DON'T WE YES 
DOWN HERE IS WHERE IT GETS EXCITING 
YOUR KITCHEN AND THINGS ARE THAT SIDE 
BUT WHAT WE'VE GOT IS A TEN METRE LOUNGE 
WHICH SPREADS RIGHT OUT AND YOU WILL HAVE TWO FULLY FORMED BALCONIES ONE THERE AND ONE OVER THERE 
WHY WOULD YOU HAVE TO BALCONIES 
BECAUSE THE CENTRAL CITY LIVING YOU WANTED IS RIGHT ON YOUR DOORSTEP 
IT IS A FANTASTIC VIEW AND IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE THAT 
I'M PLEASED YOU NOTICED THE VIEW UNLIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN THE POD 
YOU DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE YOU WERE IN A WAREHOUSE 
EASILY PLEASED EASILY PLEASED 
LET ME HELP YOU EVEN MORE BECAUSE HERE I HAVE A COMPUTER GENERATED IMAGE 
YOU CAN SEE HOW IT WILL ALL SIT TOGETHER 
THERE'S YOUR KITCHEN WITH AN ISLAND MORE COOKING SPACE 
YOU HAVE LOADS OF WARDROBE SPACE OVER HERE LOADS MORE STORAGE SPACE 
I THINK IT'S A REAL WORKABLE SPACE 
THAT IS REALLY GOOD ACTUALLY 
ARE YOU EXCITED YES GOOD I'M GLAD YOU'RE EXCITED 
WHAT YOU THINK JOHN WILL MAKE OF IT NOT SURE HERE THEY ARE 
HERE WE ARE INDEED THERE YOU GO JOHN WHAT A VIEW 
I'M NOT KRISTIAN LOVELY 
ONE LAST THING I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS I KNOW YOU THINK 
THAT VIEW IS LOVELY BUT YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE A VIEW 
BUT IN THIS CASE YOU CAN BECAUSE THIS CAR PARK OVER HERE 
IS GOING TO BE UNDERGROUND THEN WE WILL HAVE A PUBLIC PAVED AREA HERE 
IF THE WILD CARD HAS WOWED CLAIRE AND JOHN THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THEY MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER 
THIS IS AN EXCITING DEVELOPMENT BUT THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF RISK IN BUYING OFF PLAN 
CHECK THE SMALL PRINT OF YOUR CONTRACT SO YOU ARE CERTAIN THE 
SHOW HOME FIXTURES AND FITTINGS ARE WHAT YOU'LL ACTUALLY GET 
AND LET'S NOT FORGET WHY THIS PROPERTY IS OUR WILD CARD 
APART FROM THE FACT THAT YOU NEED A HARD HAT TO VIEW IT 
IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY OF LIVING WITH AN OPEN PLAN PODULAR USE OF SPACE 
THIS WOULD AFFECT THEIR LIFESTYLE SO THEY NEED TO BE SURE THEY WERE READY TO EMBRACE IT 
SO THIS CUTTING EDGE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY POD LOVELY BIG SPACE 
TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE CENTRE OF MANCHESTER TWO GORGEOUS BALCONIES GUESS THE PRICE PLEASE 
EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT FINISHED WHO'S GOING FIRST 
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO FIRST ALL RIGHT THEN 
I THINK 
IT'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND JOHN 
ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
OH JOHN YOU ARE HEDGING YOUR BETS 
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WE ARE AT A CRITICAL STAGE 
YOU GOT THE LAST TWO RIGHT WILL YOU MAKE IT A HAT TRICK 
NO YOU'RE NOT WELL DONE YOU GOT ONE RIGHT OKAY 
BUT IT'S EVEN CHEAPER THAN YOU THINK 
THE PRICE IS ACTUALLY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
SO THERE YOU GO THAT IS CERTAINLY FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
WE WANT MORE THINKING DONE IT'S DECISION TIME 
WE WANT TO KNOW WHICH ONE YOU WOULD LIKE TO TEST DRIVE 
INTERESTING HOW YOU MIGHT TEST DRIVE THIS ONE IF YOU WERE TO CHOOSE IT

ONE OF THE CENTREPIECES IN THE REDEVELOPMENT OF MANCHESTER 
DESIGNED TO BE AFFORDABLE THEY COULD HAVE THE BEST FLAT IN THE BLOCK FOR JUST ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY

I LIKED THE BALCONY AND THAT WHEN WE WENT TO SEE THE 
BUILDING SITE THAT ONE WAS GOING TO HAVE TWO BALCONIES AND THE VIEW WAS JUST BRILLIANT ON THAT 
THE FINISH IS QUITE GOOD AND THE WAY THEY USED SPACE WAS NICE 
I THINK THE FACT THAT IT WAS JUST ONE ROOM MADE ME THINK A BIT
