I THINK 
HEDGEHUNTER MIGHT WIN HIS SECOND 
NATIONAL 
IT'S CLOUDY LANE FOR ME NATIONAL IF YOU WANT THE VALUE TAKE THE 
PRICE GET THE VALUE AND TAKE THE 
PRICE PRICE YOU'RE GOING TO GET PLENTY OF 
ADVICE OVER THE NEXT HALF AN HOUR 
AND HEAR ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT 
OPINIONS AND TIPS WE'RE PREVIEWING 
THE WORLD'S GREATEST HORSE RACE 
JOINING ME IN THE STUDIO NORMAN 
WILLIAMSON WHO FINISHED SECOND ON 
MELY MOSS AND A. P. MCCOY WHO FINISHED 
THIRD PLENTY OF TIMES AND IS HOPE 
TO GET CLOSER WE TALK TO SAM

RACE 
THROUGH THE FORTY RUNNERS FOR THE BIG RACE 
WELL I SUPPOSE THERE ARE A NUMBER 
OF QUALITIES THAT YOU NEED IF 
YOU'RE ON BOARD A HORSE THAT CAN 
WIN THE GRAND NATIONAL WHAT WOULD 
BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS NO NO POINT ASKING ME OR HIM 
WE DON'T 
KNOW 
YOU NEED A 
GOOD JUMPER A KNOW GOOD KNOW GOOD STAYER OBVIOUSLY A BIT OF 
LUCK AS WELL 
CLOUDY LANE IS A VERY 
SHORT PRICED FAVOURITE YOU KNOW 
BETTER THAN ANYBODY THIS IS A RACE 
IN WHICH YOU CAN'T PREDICT ANYTHING 
A FEW YEARS AGO YOU WERE GOING 
BEAUTIFULLY IN FRONT OF CLAN ROYAL 
AND THIS HAPPENED THAT CAN 
HAPPEN 
IN THE GRAND NATIONAL L. WISH IT 
HADN'T HAPPENED TO ME OBVIOUSLY 
THAT YEAR HEDGEHUNTER WAS AN 
IMPRESSIVE WINNER HE DEFINITELY 
HAD BEEN THERE OR THERE ABOUTS AT 
THE FINISH 
IT WASN'T THE FIRST 
TIME IT HAD HAPPENED IT HAPPENED 
ALSO ON BLOWING WIND DO THEY HAVE 
TO BE EVEN MORE PATIENT IN THE 
GRAND NATIONAL 
I THINK SO WHEN I 
LOOK BACK AT MY RIDING OF THE GRAND 
NATIONAL I'M EMBARRASSED ABOUT SOME 
OF IT REALLY 
YEAH GOING TOO SOON REALLY BEING IN THE RACE TOO SOON IT'S 
MORE PROFESSIONAL THESE DAYS WATCH 
RUBY OR THIS FELLOW GOING ROUND 
THEY'RE TAKING THEIR TIME 
GRADUALLY GETTING INTO THE RACE FIFTEEN 
YEARS AGO IF YOU HAD A CHANCE YOU 
WERE IN THE FIRST SIX AT BEECHERS 
IT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT THE SAME 
I THINK I GAVE SOME HORSES TERRIBLE 
RIDES THE ONLY HORSE THAT RAN WELL 
WAS MELY MOSS L. THOUGHT I GAVE HIM 
THE RIDE I WANTED TO GIVE HIM THAT 
WAS THE SECOND RIDE I ROAD 
WOULDN'T YOU AGROW IT TAKES LONG 
TIME TO LEARN 
YEAH IT DOES THE 
MORE RIDES YOU'VE HAD THE BETTER 
YOU GET AT IT YOU DO NEED THE 
RIGHT HORSE YOU NEED A HORSE THAT 
CAN SORT HIMSELF OUT AT THE 
OBSTACLES KNOWS HOW TO JUMP ON HIS 
OWN AND HE HAS GOT TO BE A GOOD 
STAYER OVER THAT TRIP

COURSE ITSELF AND THIS IS THE WATER 
JUMP BEHIND US THE OFFICIAL 
DESCRIPTION OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF 
DAYS HERE ON THE COURSE HAS BEEN 
GOOD TO SOFT GOOD IN PLACES HAVE 
YOU AGREED WITH THAT IS THAT GOING 
TO BE DIFFERENT BEFORE TOMORROW I I DON'T THINK IT WILL CHANGE TOO MUCH 
THERE'S A LOT OF DRYING WE SAID IT 
WAS THE EASY SIDE OF GOOD IT'S 
BEEN THE SAME TODAY AS IT WAS THE 
DAY BEFORE L. WOULDN'T SAY IT WOULD 
DRY OUT TOO MUCH MORE 
YOU ROAD 
TODAY YOU PICKED UP AN INJURY TO 
YOUR HAND YOU COMPLETED THE RACE 
YOU DIDN'T FALL OR ANYTHING BUT 
YOU GOT KICKED 
I DID AT THE CANAL 
TURN ANOTHER HORSE KICKED ME AS IT 
FELL YOU'RE NOT ALWAYS FREE OF 
INJURY AS YOU STAY ON THEIR BACK 
BUT IT'S NOT TOO SERIOUS WHAT WHAT ABOUT YOUR RIDE TOMORROW COMPLY OR 
DIE HOW WILL HE GO 
I'M LOOKING 
FORWARD TO HIM HE'S A LOVELY HORSE 
HE'S BEEN KEPT WITH THIS RACE IN 
MIND HE WAS IMPRESSIVE WITH TWELVE 
STONE ON HIS BACK HE PROVED HE 
STAYS FOUR MILES TOUCH WOOD HE'S 
A PRETTY SAFE JUMPER I'M LOOKING 
FORWARD IT IT 
TIMMY WAS SECOND ON 
SMARTY A FEW YEARS AGO HOPEFULLY 
COMPLY OR DIE CAN GO ONE BETTER 
QUITE OFTEN IT'S THE GREAT STORY 
THAT COMES OUT VICTORIOUS BUTLERS 
CABIN COULD WIN IT J. P. MANDELA 
HASN'T WON IT YET AND THIS MAN J. P. 
MCMAN US HASN'T WON IT YET YOU HAD 
A FALL ON AROUND ARNOLD LANE IN 
JANUARY WE CAN HAVE 
A LOOK AT IT 
THE WAY HE FELL DID THE DAMAGE AND 
YOU WERE IN TROUBLE 
YEAH BELIEVE 
IT OR NOT WHEN I WAS ON THE GROUND 
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT FOR SOME 
SILLY REASON I WAS GOING TO BE O. K. 
I GOT A REALLY HEAVY FALL ABOUT 
FIVE WEEKS EARLIER L. KIND OF 
THOUGHT I WAS IT WAS A SIMILAR 
SORT OF PAIN TO THAT BUT IT WAS 
MORE SERIOUS 
THAT SCAR SHOWS WHAT 
WAS LEFT AFTER THE OPERATION YOU 
HAD TO INSERT A PLATE TO FUSE T. TEN 
ELEVEN AND TWELVE TOGETHER 
YEAH THEY PUT A 
PLATE DONE EITHER SIDE OF THE 
VERTEBRAE T. TEN T. ELEVEN AND T. TWELVE ARE ALL 
THE ONE NOW IT HAS TO COME OUT IN 
THE SUMMER 
IF YOU HAD THAT INJURY 
UP HIGHER THIS IS WHY YOU WANTED 
TO GET BACK YOU ROAD A WINNER AT 
THE FESTIVAL IT MUST HAVE BEEN 
GREAT TO GET BACK 
YEAH IT WAS IF 
IT WAS HIGHER IT BECOMES A LOT 
MORE SERIOUS A CASE OF WHETHER 
YOU'D WALK AGAIN REALLY LUCKILY IT 
HEALED WELL IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH 
YOU ARE IN A POSITION I AM WHEN 
YOU ARE RIDING NICE HORSES YOU 
WANT TO GET BACK QUICKLY YOU'VE YOU'VE TRIED SEVERAL TIMES AND GOT 
REASONABLY CLOSE YOU WENT CLOSE A 
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHAT DO YOU 
THINK OF BUTLERS CABIN'S CHANCES 
HE'S GOT GOOD CREDENTIALS RECENT 
IRISH GRAND NATIONAL WINNERS HAVE 
DONE WELL HE'S WON AT THE FESTIVAL 
WE HAD THIS RACE IN MIND THOUGHT 
HE RAN WELL IN HIS FIRST RUN OF THE 
SEASON A BIT DISAPPOINTING HIS 
LAST TWO STARTS JOHN IS HAPPY WITH 
HIM AND I WAS HAPPY WITH HIM 
YOU'RE EMPLOYED BY J. P. MCMAN US AND 
HE HAS KINGS CASTLE BOB HALL AND 
LAMI KING JOHN'S CASTLE A LOT OF 
PEOPLE FANCY HIM 
MY REASON FOR 
BUTLERS CABIN WAS HE WON AN IRISH 
GRAND NATIONAL HE DESERVES THE 
LOYALTY A LOT OF THE TIPSTERS HAVE 
TIPPED KINGS JOHN CASTLE AT BIG 
PRICES LAMI GAVE ME A GREAT RIDE 
LAST YEAR HE'S LOWER IN THE 
WEIGHTS THIS TIME ROUND HE RAN 
WELL AT CHELTENHAM IF I WAS WANT 
TO RIDE A HORSE TO GIVE ME A GOOD 
RIDE THAT WOULD BE HIM HE HAD A 
CHANCE TO WIN THE GRAND NATIONAL 
LAST YEAR AND COULDN'T L. DON'T 
WANT A NICE RIDE I WANT TO WIN 
BOB HALL YOU WERE NEVER TEMPTED BY 
HIM NO 
OF THE OTHER HORSES IN THE HIM NO RACE IF YOU WEREN'T RETAINED BY J. M. 
MCMANNUS WHAT ARE THE OTHERS WOW 
LIKE 
IT'S THE OBVIOUS THING LIKE CLOUDY LANE IF THE HANDY CAPPER 
WERE DOING IT AGAIN HE WOULD GIVE 
ME TWENTY POUNDS MORE HE DESERVES TO 
BE THE PRICE HE IS HEDGEHUNTER 
HAVE PROBABLY GOT A CHANCE BUT 
HE'S GOT A LOT OF WEIGHT L. DON'T 
KNOW WHETHER HE RAN WELL LAST TIME 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE COULD WIN 
ANOTHER GRAND NATIONAL L. COULD SEE 
HIM FINISHING FOURTH OR FIFTH AND 
RUNNING A BLINDER 
WOULD YOU FANCY 
OF THE IRISH HORSES L. ROAD A FEW OF THEM LAST WEEK HEDGEHUNTER HAS 
BEEN ROUND HERE A FEW TIMES HE HAS 
THE RIGHT MAN ON HIS BACK HANDY 
CAP IS TIGHT TOGETHER ONLY EIGHTEEN 
POUNDS BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE 
BOTTOM COULD YOU FANCY HIM HE'S HE'S NOT WITHOUT A CHANCE AMBERLEIGH 
HOUSE WAS OLD QUITE OLD AND HE 
WON IT HE HAS BEEN GOOD ROUND 
THESE FENCES I'M NOT SURE THAT 
IT'S A TOP I'M NOT SURE THERE'S 
HORSES IN THERE THAT WILL GO ON TO 
ACHIEVE GET THE HIGHER RATINGS IF 
YOU LIKE L. THINK HE HE'S GOT A 
VERY GOOD CHANCE 
A LOT OF PEOPLE 
WILL BE CHEERING YOU TOMORROW WE 
HOPE YOU GET A GOOD RIDE ON BUTLERS 
CABIN THANK YOU FOR COMING IN 
WE'RE GOING TO LET YOU MOVE TO ONE 
SIDE AND WE WILL LET JIM MCGRAU AND 
SAM THOMAS IN THEIR PLACES IN A 
MOMENT HORSES THAT WIN WITH THE 
WRONG JOCKEY ON BOARD IS OFTEN HERE 
PARTY POLITICS AND EARTH SUMMIT'S 
JOCKEY HAS GONE ON TO WIN THE RACE 
ANDREW THORNTON WILL BE WATCHING 
FROM THE SIDE LINES 
THE STORY OF SIMON IS A TALE OF TWO 
JOCKEYS ONE OF THEM IS HIS REGULAR 
RIDER ANDREW THORNTON BECAUSE OF 
INJURY HE MISSES HIS RIDE IN THE 
GRAND NATIONAL GIVING THIS YOUNG 
MAN DOMINIC ELZ WORTH HIS CHANCE 
OF GROWER GLORY 
I KNEW I HADN'T 
BROKEN A COLLAR BONE BECAUSE I 
HAVEN'T GOT A COLLAR BONE TO BREAK 
IN THAT SHOULDER L. KNEW IT WAS A 
DISLOCATION THE FIRST THING THAT 
FLASHED IN FRONT OF MY MIND WAS HOW 
LONG WILL IT TAKE TO GET BACK L. 
RANG DOCTOR RUBY WALSH TO SEE WHAT I'VE 
DONE I KNEW I HAD SIX WEEKS TO GET 
BACK AFTER SEEING THE SPECIALIST 
HE TOLD ME THERE'S NO CHANCE HE 
SAID TO ME FIVE TO SIX MONTHS L. 
KNEW HE HAD A GREAT CHANCE MY BEST 
CHANCE OF POSSIBLY WINNING THE 
NATIONAL HEART JUST SUNK 
FROM MY 
POINT OF VIEW JUMP JOCKEYS IT'S 
TEN PER CENT PLEASURE NINETY PER CENT DISAPPOINTMENT 
MY BOSS AND GREAT FRIEND AFTER A 
BAD CAR CRASH AND I THINK TO MYSELF 
I'VE GOT A BAD INJURY BUT I'VE GOT 
NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT 
HOW DID 
HE ENJOY HIS NATIONAL EXPERIENCE 
LAST YEAR 
HE ENJOYED IT UNTIL THE 
TWENTY FIFTH 
HE JUMPED GREAT ALL THE WAY TWENTY FIFTH UNTIL I SAW THE PICTURE OF HIM 
COMING THROUGH THE CHAIR DON'T 
TELL DOMINIC THAT AS A KID ALL 
YOU WANT TO DO IS RIDE IN THE 
NATIONAL AFTER YOU'VE RIDDEN IN 
THE NATIONAL THAT WAS MY LIFETIME 
AMBITION WHEN I WAS ABOUT TEN 
YEARS OLD 
YEARS OLD 
AFTER YOU'VE RIDDEN IN 
IT YOU WANT TO WIN IT IF IT 
HAPPENS TO DOMINIC I'LL BE FIRST 
TO SHAKE HIS HAND AND SAY WELL DONE 
I WOULDN'T BE HUMAN IF THERE WASN'T 
PART OF ME THINKING IT COULD HAVE 
BEEN ME 
WERE YOU IN THE SAME POSITION WITH 
GAY TRIP 
WE WERE I SUPPOSE TERRY 
COULDN'T RIDE HIM HE WAS SMASHED 
UP PAT TAFFE ROAD HIM AND HE WON 
MAYBE IT'S A GOOD OMEN 
IT'S NOT 
IDEAL ME TALKING TO YOU ON THE 
GROUND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE 
NATIONAL 
I'M VERY UPSET BUT I NATIONAL HAVE A VERY GOOD SUBSTITUTE BUT 
I'M UPSET 
HE'S VERY WELL HE'S 
JOGED BACK FROM THE GALLOPS AND 
GIVING ME A BIT OF A HARD TIME 
EXPLAIN FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THE 
DISAPPOINTMENT THAT ANDY HAS TO 
FACE 
IT'S DESPERATELY BAD LUCK FACE UNFORTUNATELY IT'S PART OF THE JOB 
THESE THINGS DO HAPPEN WHAT'S WHAT'S ANDREW TOLD YOU ABOUT SIMON THAT 
YOU THINK THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO 
PUT INTO USE ON THE BIG DAY THE THE WAY HE JUMPS HE'S ONLY A SMALL 
HORSE L. WON'T GO ASKING FOR BIG 
QUESTIONS ESPECIALLY EARLY ON IN 
THE RACE WE DO KNOW HE'S WON OVER 
A GOOD TRIP HE'S DONE FOUR MILES 
IN THE PAST HE STAYS ALL DAY 
HOPEFULLY HE'LL LIKE THE GROUND 
THE CONDITIONS 
YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S 
LIKE HE'S KEEN GOING DOWN TO 
BECHER'S GET HIM TO DROP THE BRIDLE 
JUST GET HIM POPPING BIT OF LUCK 
CLEAR ROUND HE WON'T BE FAR AWAY 
BIT OF LUCK 
HE'S PROBABLY FURTHER 
FORWARD THIS YEAR THAN HE WAS AT 
THIS STAGE LAST YEAR SO HE LOOKS A 
MILLION DOLLARS I'M ENVEES WISH 
IT WAS ME 
HE'LL BE SMILING THROUGH 
THE TEARS THOUGH JIM MCGRAU AND 
SAM THOMAS WITH ME NOW CRACKING 
RIDE WITH MR. POINTMENT THE LAST 
JOCKEY TO DO THE DOUBLE WAS JIM 
CULLOTY ON BINDAREE 
HE HAS HAD A 
CRACKING RUN THIS YEAR HE'S HAD 
EXPERIENCE ROUND HERE BIT OF LUCK 
IN RUNNING EARLY ON 
YOU MUST HAVE 
REALLY ENJOYED HIM IN THE BEECHERS 
CHASE HE SEEMED TO MEASURE THE 
FENCES WELL HE LOVED IT HE HE ENJOYED IT AS MUCH AS I DID TO BE 
FAIR HE LANDS AND LOOKS FOR THE 
NEXT ONE HE'S MADE FOR THESE 
FENCES HE'S MEASURING EVERY FENCE 
REALLY THAT DAY I HAD A CRACKING 
RIDE OFF HIM 
THAT DAY THERE WERE 
NINETEEN RUNNERS IN THE BECER CHASE 
TOMORROW THERE'S FORTY HE'S A HORSE 
WHICH HASN'T HAD MANY RUNS NINE IN 
HIS LIFE SIX OVER FENCES IS HE 
EXPERIENCED ENOUGH 
DEFINITELY THE 
GOOD THING ABOUT HIM EARLY IN THE 
RACE HE TRAVELS THAT'S WHAT YOU 
NEED THERE WILL BE A LOT OF 
FALLERS HE'LL BE TRAVELLING AND I 
CAN POINT HIM WHERE I WANT THAT'S 
WHAT YOU NEED IT AVOID THE CARNAGE 
HE BROKE 
A BLOOD VESSEL LAST TIME 
THAT'S TECHNICAL TERM HOW BIG A 
SET BACK IS THAT 
WELL IT SHOWED 
HOW BIG IT WAS BECAUSE HE RAN SO 
BADLY BUT IF HE CAN PUT THAT 
BEHIND HIM AND IF HE DIDN'T DO THAT 
YOU CAN'T GO INTO THE RACE AND 
THINK HE'S GOING TO BLEED 
OBVIOUSLY THEY'VE TRIED TO TREAT 
HIM AT HOME FOR IT THERE'S ONLY SO 
MUCH YOU CAN DO 
TECH NICKALLY 
SPEAKING YOU'VE WRITTEN A GRAND 
NATIONAL WINNER SILVER BIRCH THE 
YEAR BEFORE HE RAN 
I GOT KNOCKED 
OUT IN THE BUMPER LAST YEAR ONLY 
THE ONE NATIONAL RIDE I'M GLAD 
I'VE MADE IT TO RIDING IT THIS TIME 
WHAT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE OTHER 
HORSES BEWLEYS BERRY 
I THINK THEY 
LEFT HIM SHORT THAT DAY HE STAYS 
VERY WELL JUMPS WELL AND DENIS 
O'REGAN IS KEEN ON HIM FOR ME THE 
FAVOURITE WITH A CLEAR ROUND HE'S 
GOING TO TAKE THE BEATING 
HOW MUCH 
HOME WORK DO YOU DO JIM STUDIES 
THE COLOURS HOW MUCH DO YOU LOOK 
AROUND YOU TO SEE WHO'S IN FRONT 
TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT BEHIND A 
BAD JUMPER 
IN ANY RACE YOU NEED TO 
KNOW WHAT'S AGAINST YOU AND TRACK 
THE HORSES WITH THE BEST CHANCE AND 
ONE THAT DOESN'T JUMP WELL YOU 
DON'T WANT TO BE BEHIND ONE OF 
THOSE IN THE NATIONAL YOU HAVE TO 
GO AWAY YOU KNOW TRY AND DODGE THE 
LOOSE HORSES

SURE HE JUMPS REALLY WELL OVER 
NORMAL FENCES NO REASON WHY HE 
WOULDN'T JUMP THESE HE'S ANOTHER 
ONE LIKE MR. POINTMENT WHO ENJOYS 
HIS RACING
