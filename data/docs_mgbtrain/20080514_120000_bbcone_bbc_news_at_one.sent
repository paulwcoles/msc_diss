GOVERNMENT'S PLANS FOR THE NEXT 
YEAR GIVING DETAILS 
HE IS PLANNING TO INCLUDE IN 
NOVEMBER'S QUEEN'S SPEECH THEY 
INCLUDE MORE HELP FOR FIRST TIME 
HOUSE BUYERS AND EXTENDING FLEXIBLE 
WORKING RIGHTS FOR MOTHERSERLY YES 
HE HAD TO DEFEND YESTERDAY'S 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF A TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION TAX 
CUT TO COMPENSATE FOR THE ABOLITION 
OF THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS CALLED IT A 
CHARADE AND JAMES LANDALE IS IN 
WESTMINSTER FOR US WITH MORE THANK 
YOU IN THE PAST YOU ALWAYS HAD TO 
WAIT UNTIL AUTUMN AT THE BEGINNING 
OF THE PARLIAMENTARY YEAR TO FIND 
OUT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS 
WERE GORDON BROWN NOW GIVES US A 
SNEAK PREVIEW JUST BEFORE THE 
SUMMER HERE IT IS A DOCUMENT IN 
ALL ITS GLORY PREPARING BRITAIN 
FOR THE FUTURE AND IT IS EIGHTEEN BILLS 
OR MEASURES THAT EFFECTIVELY CAN BE 
DIVIDED INTO TWO ONE MEASURES TO 
TRY TO SEE THE COUNTRY THROUGH THE 
ECONOMIC SITUATION AT THE MOMENT 
AND SECONDLY MEASURES TO TRY TO 
AS THE LOGO SAYS PREPARE US FOR 
THE FUTURE LET'S LOOK AT JUST A 
FEW OF THOSE ITEMS THAT THE PRIME 
MINISTER HAS JUST ANNOUNCED IN 
DETAIL FIRST MORE HELP FOR HOME 
BUYERS SPECIFICALLY WHAT HE'S 
GOING TO DO IS EXPAND AN EXISTING 
SHARED EQUITY SCHEME JUST AT THE 
MOMENT IT IS FOR KEY WORKERS HE 
WILL EXPAND IT TO ALL THOSE ON LOW 
INCOMES SECONDLY DO MORE TO 
ENCOURAGE AND PROTECT SAFERS FIRST 
HE WILL CREATE A NATIONAL SAVINGS 
SCHEME WHEREBY THOSE ON LOW INCOME 
IF THEY SAVE EVERY POUND THEY PUT 
IN IT IS MATCHED BY THE GOVERNMENT 
HE IS ALSO GOING TO HAVE A BANKING 
BILL THAT WILL HELP PROTECT 
DEPOSITERS' CASH IN THE WAKE OF THE 
NORTHERN ROCK FIASCO THIRDLY HE 
WILL ACT TO TRY TO TACKLE POOR 
SCHOOLS GIVING PARENTS GREATER 
RIGHTS TO DEMAND HIGHER STANDARDS 
BUT ALSO PUTTING EXTRA DUTIES ON 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ACTUALLY CLOSE 
FAILING SCHOOLS AND REPLACE THEM 
WITH NEW ONES IN THEIR PARTICULAR 
PATCH ALSO THEY ARE GOING TO DO 
MORE TO MAKE POLICE MORE 
ACCOUNTABLE SPECIFICALLY BY MAKING 
SURE THERE IS A SCHEME OF ELECTED 
REPRESENTATIVES WHO CAN 
REPRESENTATIVE LOCAL PEOPLE AND 
MAKE SURE THE POLICE ARE FOLLOWING 
THEIR PRIORITIES THIS IS HOW THE 
PRIME MINISTER SUMMED UP ALL OF 
THAT IN THE HOUSE JUST A SHORT 
WHILE AGO 
A BANKING BILL TO 
SUPPORT FINANCIAL STABILITY AN 
EDUCATION BILL TO ENSURE EVERY 
SCHOOL IS A GOOD SCHOOL AND N. H. S. 
BILL TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH SERVICE 
AND ENTRANCHE PATIENTS' RIGHTS 
IMMIGRATION BILL IS PEOPLE EARN 
THEIR CITIZENSHIP AND WELFARE 
REFORM BILL AND REFORMS ON AGENCY 
WORKERS ON SKILLS AND FLEXIBLE 
WORKING THESE ARE THE PRIORITIES 
AND I COMEMED THIS STATEMENT TO THE 
HOUSE COMMEND 
THE WIDER 
POLITICS ARE CLEAR THEY ARE TO 
MOVE THE GOVERNMENT ON AND PUT ALL 
THEIR TROUBLES BEHIND THEM HAVING 
WATCHING PMQ'S BEFORE THE STATEMENT 
IT IS CLEAR THE OPPOSITION PARTIES 
ARE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN 
TO STOP THE GOVERNMENT DOING THAT 
A TAX GIVE AWAY YESTERDAY A NEW 
POLICY PROGRAMME TODAY GORDON 
BROWN'S DESPERATE TO PUT THE LAST 
FEW MISERABLE WEEKS BEHIND HIM BUT 
HIS OPPONENTS HAVE NO INTENTION OF 
LETTING HIM OFF LIGHTLY THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER SAID 
YESTERDAY'S TAX CHANGES WERE A 
CHARADE 
HOW CAN THEY ALL IGNORE CHARADE THE FACT THAT EVEN AFTER 
YESTERDAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT OVER ONE 
MILLION OF THE POOREST PEOPLE IN 
THIS COUNTRY ARE STILL WORSE OFF 
DON'T THEY MATTER 
TWENTY TWO MILLION ARE 
BETTER OFF NO GOVERNMENT HAS A 
BETTER RECORD IN TACKLING POVERTY 
THAN THIS GOVERNMENT 
BUT MR. CLEGG 
DEMANDED TO KNOW WHEN THERE WOULD 
BE COMPENSATION FOR THOSE STILL OUT 
OF POCKET 
THE FACT RE MAINS UNDER 
A LABOUR GOVERNMENT THE WORST PAID 
ARE WORSE OFF WHY DO THEY HAVE TO 
PAY FOR HIS INCOMPETENCE EVERY EVERY PERSON IN THE COUNTRY WHO IS AN 
INCOME TAXPAYER AT THE BASIC RATE 
IS EVERYTHING ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWENTY TWO MILLION WILL 
RECEIVE THAT MONEY HOUSEHOLD WHERE 
THERE ARE TWO WILL RECEIVED DOUBLE 
WE HAVE DONE WHAT WE SET WE WOULD 
DO TO OFFSET THE AVERAGE LOSSES MR. MR BROWN WROM MISSED THERE WOULD BE 
FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS IN THE AUTUMN 
PROMISED 
DID THE TIMING OF THE 
TAX ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY HAVE 
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE BY 
ELECTION 
AS A THE CHANCELLOR ELECTION SAID YESTERDAY HE HAD TO BRING 
FORWARD HIS 
IF THEY WERE 
TO GO INTO THE FINANCE BILL TO BE 
LEGISLATED NOW 
A CYNICAL DRIVE AS 
THE TORIES SAY OR AN ATTEMPT TO 
REVERSE A MISTAKE VOTERS IN CREWE 
AND NANTWITCH WILL GIVE THEIR 
VERDICT NEXT WEEK HERE TO DISCUSS 
ALL OF THAT AND THE GOVERNMENT'S 
ANNOUNCEMENTS I AM JOINED BIHAR YET 
HARMAN WELCOME ECONOMIC STABILITY 
UNLOCKING POTENTIAL PERSONALISING 
PUBLIC SERVICES THIS IS FAMILIAR 
STUFF WHAT IS NEW ABOUT WHAT HAS 
BEEN ANNOUNCED 
THERE ARE A NUMBER 
OF NEW THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN A 
ANNOUNCED FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU 
WILL HAVE HEARD THE PRIME MINISTER 
SAY THAT WITH PARENTS WITH CHILDREN 
UP TO THE AGE OF SIXTEEN THEY WILL HAVE 
A RIGHT TO REQUEST FLEXIBLE WORKING 
WITHIN THIS DOCUMENT THERE ARE A 
NUMBER OF NEW THINGS THAT ARE BEING 
ANNOUNCED FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT 
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT 
TODAY WE ARE SETTING OUT ALL THE 
LAWS THAT WE ARE PUTTING FORWARD TO 
ALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE THEIR SAY WE 
HAVE MADE CLEAR OUR OBJECTIVES WE 
WANT A STRONG AND STABLE ECONOMY 
GOOD HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS BUT WE 
ARE GIVING THE CHANCE TO THE PUBLIC 
TO SEE WHAT NORMALLY WOULD HAVE 
GONE ON BEHIND CLOSED DOORS 
HOW DO 
YOU HELP ECONOMIC STABILITY TO 
BORROW FOR A TAX CUT BEFORE A 
BLECTION 
IT HELPS 
THE ECONOMY AND BLECTION THE INDIVIDUALS WHO LOST OUT UNDER THE TAX CHANGES BUT IT ALSO PUTS 
MORE MONEY INTO PEOPLE'S POCKETS AT 
A TIME WHEN THEY ARE FACING 
INCREASED FOOD AND FUEL BILLS IT 
HELPS THE ECONOMY AND FAMILIES 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE YOU HAVE 
IT A LOT OF MEAT THAT EVERYTHING 
HAS TO GET THROUGH WE'LL GO 
THROUGH THE FINE PRINT LATER BACK 
TO YOU THANK YOU THE PRIME 
MINISTER HAS PROMISED SUPPORT FOR 
THE BRITISH PEOPLE DURING TROUBLED 
ECONOMIC TIMES AND THERE IT MAY 
WILL BE NEEDED AS MERVYN KING SAID 
THE ECONOMY IS TRAVELLING ALONG 
PUMPY ROAD HE HAS PAINTED A GRIM 
PICTURE THIS YEAR AND WARNED OF 
SHARP SLOWDOWN IN GROWTH AND 
CONSUMER SPENDING AND JUMP IN 
INFLATION PERHAPS AS HIGH AS THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT 
FIGURES SHOW RISE IF UNEMPLOYMENT 
UP FOURTEEN THOUSAND TO JUST OVER SIXTEEN MILLION 
WE HAVE THIS REPORT PRICES FOR 
GOODS AND SERVICES ARE ACK KEL 
RATING AND INFLATION HAS JUMPED AND 
THE HOUSING MARKET IS SLIDING AND 
TODAY WE LEARNED THAT UNEMPLOYMENT 
HAS GONE UP ACCELERATED THE 
GOVERNMENT ISN'T GETTING ANY HELP 
FROM THE ECONOMY AND THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND GOVERNOR HAS WARNED THAT 
THINGS WILL GET WORSE BEFORE THEY 
GET BETTER WITH GROWTH SLOWING 
ABRUPTLY AND INFLATION RISING EVEN 
FURTHER 
FOR THE TIME BEING AS FURTHER LEAST THE NICE DECADE IS BEHIND US 
THE CREDIT CYCLE HAS TURNED 
COMMODITY PRICES ARE RISING WE ARE 
TRAVELLING ALONG A BUMPY ROAD AS 
THE ECONOMY REBALANCES MOMENTUM MOMENTUM OUT THERE IN THE REAL ECONOMY IS 
ALREADY SLOWING AND MERSEYSIDE IS 
NO EXCEPTION THE FIRST PHASE OF A 
NEW RETAIL AND LEISURE DEVELOPMENT 
WILL OPEN SOON BUT SOME UNITS WILL 
BE EMPTY RETAIL EXPERTS SAY IT IS 
UNUSUAL FOR A BIG SHOPPING CENTRE 
TO OPEN NOT FULLY LET THE 
MANAGEMENT SAYS IT IS CONFIDENT 
THERE WILL BE NO EMPTY UNITS FOR 
THE OFFICIAL OPENING IN SEPTEMBER 
THERE ISN'T MUCH CONFIDENCE IN THE 
HOUSE HOUSING MARKET HERE AT 
MERSEYSIDE'S BIGGEST FIRM THEY HAVE 
A BLUNT MESSAGE WHO THEY SAY ARE 
RATIONING THE SUPPLY OF MORTGAGES 
UNLESS THEY SHOW MORE CONFIDENCE 
AND MORE INSPIRATION AND ACT LIKE A 
BANK SHOULD ACT LEND MONEY IT MAY 
GET WORSE 
BUT IF YOU MOVE AWAY 
FROM THE CHOPPY WATERS SURROUNDING 
THE CONSUMER SIDE OF THE ECONOMY 
RETAILING AND THE HOUSE BEING 
MARKET FOR EXAMPLE THE OUTLOOK IS 
RATHER BRIGHTER HERE AT THE 
CAMMELL LAIRD'S SHIPYARD AND REPAIR 
AND BUILDING BUSINESS IS GROWING 
THEY ARE TAKING ON FOREIGN 
CONTRACTS 
EWANT TO BUILD ON THAT CONTRACTS SUCCESS AND TAKE IT ON TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL STAGE WHERE I 
BELIEVE WE WILL BE VERY VERY 
SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE WE HAVE QUALITY 
EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES DELIVERING A 
QUALITY SERVICE 
THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND HOPES COMPANIES LIKE THIS 
WILL BE THE ECONOMY FIRING WHEN 
CONSUMER SPENDING COOLS BUT IT CAN 
ONLY HOPE CHINA IS SENDING 
THOUSANDS OF EXTRA TROOPS TO 
SUPPORT THE RESCUE OPERATION IN THE 
EARTHQUAKE HIT REGION OF SICHUAN 
ALMOST FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE KNOWN TO 
HAVE DIED TENS OF THOUSANDS ARE 
STILL MISSING ENTIRE TOWNS HAVE 
BEEN RAZED TO THE GROUND IN WENCHUAN 
THIS IS HOW DESPERATE LIFE HAS 
BECOME IN SICHUAN THIS FARMER 
SEARCHES WHAT IS LEFT OF HIS HOME 
FOR FOOD FOR HIS FAMILY HE FIND 
ONLY A FEW TINY GRAINS OF CORN HIS 
WIFE AND HIS GRANDSON SURVIVED THE 
EARTHQUAKE BUT NOW THEY ARE HUNGRY 
AND FRIGHTENED WE WE HAVE NO HOUSE SO WE HAVE TO SIT IN 
THE OPEN AIR WE CAN'T FIND 
ANYTHING TO EAT 
CHINA'S PRIME 
MINISTER WEN JIABAO IS STILL ON THE 
SCENE A LEADERSHIP THAT CAN SEEM 
REMOTE HAS NEVER BEEN SO CLOSE TO 
ITS PEOPLE HE TELLS THIS GIRL 
DON'T CRY THE GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE 
CARE OF YOU WE WILL FIND YOU A 
HOME YOU WILL GO BACK TO SCHOOL 
ANOTHER THIRTY THOUSAND TROOPS ARE ON THE 
WAY HARDLY A HOUSE HAS BEEN LEFT 
UNDAMAGED ENTIRE VILLAGES HAVE 
BEEN WIPED OUT BRITISH TOURISTS 
ARE THOUGHT TO BE AMONG THE MISSING 
THE U. K.'S AMBASSADOR WAS IN SICHUAN 
PROMISING HELP 
THE PRIME MINISTER 
AND FECT HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH 
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT MAKING CLEAR 
THAT WE STAND READY TO ASSIST AND 
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS OFFERED THE 
CHINESE GOVERNMENT UP TO ONE MILLION 
OF IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY RELIEF 
ASSISTANCE 
AMID THE DESTRUCTION A ASSISTANCE MOMENT OF HUMAN COMFORT FROM THE 
RUBBLE OF A COLLAPSED SCHOOL A 
LITTLE BOY IS FOUND ALIVE FOR A 
MOMENT THERE IS RELIEF AS OTHERS 
ARE FOUND TOO BUT MOST OF THE 
CLASSMATES HAVE BEEN LOST THE 
LOSSES NOW ARE BEING COUNTED IN THE 
TENS OF THOUSANDS AND STILL MANY 
MORE ARE MISSING BEIJING HAS 
THROWN EVERYTHING IT HAS AT THIS 
DISASTER BUT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE 
BEEN TRAPPED IN THE RUBBLE FOR MORE 
THAN TWO DAYS IT MAY ALREADY BE TOO 
LATE WE SAW CHILDREN BEING PULLED 
ALIVE FROM THE RUBBLE FROM A SCHOOL 
IN THE ROAR OUR CORRESPONDENT IS 
AT ANOTHER SCHOOL AND HE TOLD US 
HOW THE RESCUE EFFORTS THERE WERE 
PROGRESSING THE SCHOOL HERE IS NOW 
A PILE OF CONCRETE RUBBLE AND 
TWISTED STEEL BEHIND THOSE YELLOW 
RESCUE CRANES THERE IT IS NOT 
KNOWN HOW MANY CHILDREN REMAIN 
TRAPPED IN THE WRECKAGE BUT 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY HERE RESCUE 
WORKERS HAVE BEEN BRINGING OUT 
BODIES THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF 
DISTRAUGHT RELATIVES MANY OF THEM 
IN TEARS DESPERATE FOR ANY 
INFORMATION THEY CAN GET ABOUT 
THEIR CHILDREN AND OF COURSE FOR 
THEM BECAUSE OF CHINA'S ONE CHILD 
POLICY THEIR OWN OFFSPRING WAS IN 
THAT SCHOOL THE DAY THE EARTHQUAKE 
STRUCK A WHOLE GENERATION OF 
CHILDREN MAY NOW BE LOST THEY WANT 
THE RESCUE WORKERS HERE TO DO MORE 
BUT IT'S NOW TWO DAYS SINCE THE 
EARTHQUAKE STRUCK AND WITH EACH 
PASSING HOUR HOPE OF BRINGING 
ANYONE OUT ALIVE IS FADING FAST 
YOU CAN STAY UP TO DATE WITH THE 
LATEST DETAILS ON THE SITUATION BY 
GOING TO OUR WEBSITE 
HERE TWO TEENAGERS HAVE BEEN 
ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE 
MURDER OF A MAN ON OXFORD STREET ON 
MONDAY STEVEN BIGBY WAS STABBED IN 
THE CHEST DURING A ROW THE UN SAYS 
ANOTHER CYCLONE COULD BE FORMING 
FEAR BURMA LESS THAN TWO WEEKS 
AFTER ONE LEFT MORE THAN SIXTY THOUSAND 
PEOPLE DEAD OR MISSING AT THE 
MOMENT THERE IS A BAD OF SUMMER 
STORMS CAUSING RAIN OVER THE WORST 
HIT PARTS ALREADY CAUSING PROBLEMS 
FOR THE RELIEF EFFORTS IF AS 
PREDICTED THE WINDS STRENGTHEN AS 
IT MOVING OVER THE IRRAWADDY DELTA 
IT WILL WILL BECOME A TROPICAL 
STORM AND POSSIBLY A CYCLONE OUR 
COURSE PONTENT IN BURMA WHO CAN'T 
BE NAMED FOR HIS OWN SAFETY STOKE 
TO US EARLIER IN THE FAR SOUTH 
WEST THE BEACHES ARE LITTERED WITH 
BOD CIZ OF THE DEAD WHO ARE SWEPT 
OVER BY THE TIDAL SURGE THAT WAS 
DRAGGED IN A WEEK AGO BODIES 
THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE THE ONES IN 
MOST DESPERATE NEED OF HELP SOME 
DON'T HAVE COMMUNITY INDICATION 
WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND RELY ON 
BOATS TO GET AROUND 
COMMUNICATION THESE PEOPLE ARE 
DRINKING RAIN WATER IF IT IS 
AVAILABLE OTHERWISE THEY ARE 
DESPERATELY SHORT OF CLEAN WATER 
THE RAIN HAS BEEN FALLING TO RENT 
CHILLY OVER MOST OF SOUTHERN BURMA 
FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO SURVIVED THE 
CYCLONE MOST OF THOSE ARE HOMELESS 
AT THE MOMENT THEY ARE STRUGGLING 
TO TAKE 
THE WEATHER 
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST 
COUPLE OF DAYS IS MORE AID BEING 
DELIVERED BUT IT IS PIECEMEAL NOT 
VERY WELL ORGANISED DOESN'T APPEAR 
TO BE GETTING TO THE PEOPLE WHO 
NEED IT EVEN IN SOME CASES 
COMMUNITIES HALF AN HOUR AWAY FROM 
THE TOWN THAT HAS RECEIVED AID ARE 
DESPERATELY IN NEED WHAT WE HAVE 
WITNESSED IS A STEPPING UP OF 
SECURITY IN THE CAPITAL RANGOON 
THERE ARE MORE CHECKPOINTS WE WERE 
YESTERDAY PREVENTED FROM ENTERING 
ONE AREA OF THE DELTA BECAUSE 
OUTSIDERS WERE NOT ALLOWED IN WE 
UNDERSTAND THAT IS AFFECTING AID 
WORKERS FROM TOMORROW SO IT DOES 
NOT LOOK AS IF THE BURMESE 
GOVERNMENT IS BEING ANY MORE 
LENIENT IN THE WAY IT TREATS 
FOREIGN AID SPECIALISTS 
THOUSANDS OF HOSPITAL PATIENTS IN 
ENGLAND ARE STILL BEING TREATED ON 
MIXED SEX WARDS DESPITE PROMISES 
THE MAJORITY WOULD CLOSE THE 
FIGURES COME FROM A SURVEY OF 
SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PATIENTS IN WHICH MOST 
PEOPLE SAID THEY WERE HAPPY WITH 
THEIR OVERALL CARE CATHERINE 
MARSTON IS IN LIVERPOOL 
YES THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY BEST 
HOSPITALS IN ENGLAND ACCORDING TO 
ITS PATIENTS AND THEIR VIEWS 
REALLY DO COUNT IF YOU ARE 
SOMEBODY GOING INTO HOSPITAL FOR AN 
OPERATION OR PROCEDURE WHAT ARE 
THE THINGS THAT REALLY MATTER TO 
YOU MOST THAT IS WHAT THIS SURVEY 
IS TRYING TO FIND OUT ITS AIM IS 
TO IMPROVE STANDARDS OF PATIENT 
CARE CARE GIVING PATIENTS A VOICE THIS 
SURVEY ARE ASKED ABOUT THEIR 
EXPERIENCES IN AREAS SUCH AS MIXED 
WARDS LEVELS OF CLEANLINESS HELP 
WITH FEEDING AND CALL BUTTON 
RESPONSE TIMES ALMOST A THIRD OF 
PATIENTS SAID THEY HAD TO SHARE A 
BATHROOM WITH THE OPPOSITE SEX AND 
THERE WERE WIDE VARIATIONS IN THE 
NUMBERS OF MIXED WARDS THIS 
HOSPITAL IS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST 
FOR SEPARATE WARDS AND PATIENTS 
VALUE THAT 
ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE 
CUT ALL THE WAY DOWN AND YOU ONLY 
HAVE LITTLE TOPS BECAUSE 
EVERYTHING HURTS OTHERWISE YOU 
HAVE TO WALK AROUND COVERED UP WHEN 
THE MEN ARE THERE IT IS NOT BAD 
WHEN IT 
IS JUST LADIES CLEANLINESS CLEANLINESS IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR PATIENTS HELLO HELLO LADIES 
HERE AT THE LADIES CARDIOTHORACIC CENTRE THEY USED 
MATRONS TO HEAD UP TEAMS WHO 
INSPECT WARDS FOR HYGIENE 
NATIONALLY PATIENTS FEEL STANDARDS 
ARE FALLING HERE THEY ARE AT THE 
TOP OF THE TABLE FOR CLEANLINESS 
SOMETIMES IT IS NOT EASY BUT IT IS 
ABOUT HAVING THE CONVICTION AND 
STANDARDS AND MAKING SURE YOU 
ADHERE TO THOSE STANDARDS SOME SOME PATIENTS STRUGGLE TO EAT IN 
HOSPITAL AGAIN THE CARDIOTHORACIC 
CENTRE COMES TOP FOUR ALWAYS 
PROVIDING HELP AT THE BOTTOM 
EALING HOSPITAL N. H. S. TRUST JUST THIRTY EIGHT 
PER CENT SAID STAFF ALWAYS HELPED THEM EAT 
IT ALSO HAS SOME OF THE HIGHEST 
NUMBER OF PATIENTS WANTING TO 
COMPLAIN ABOUT THEIR CARE WHEN 
PATIENTS NEED HELP THEY USE CALL 
BUTTONS IT VARIES WIDELY HELD FAST 
THOSE ARE ANSWERED AND PATIENCE 
HERE THAN 
YOU A QUICK RESPONSE ALL ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PRESS THE BUTTON 
AND THEY ARE THERE L. CAN'T SPEAK 
TOO HIGHLY OF IT THEY ARE 
WONDERFUL EVERY ONE OF THEM 
PIECING THE SURVEY TOGETHER CREATES 
AN OVERALL PICTURE OF WHAT PATIENTS 
REALLY THINK ABOUT THEIR CARE THE 
COMMISSION SAYS TRUSTS DOING BADLY 
MUST LISTEN 
THE HEALTHCARE COMMISSION SAYS 
THOSE POORLY PERFORMING TRUSTS MUST 
LEARNT LESSONS FROM THE ONES THAT 
ARE DOING WELL AND IT IS WARNING 
SOME OF THE POOREST AND MOST 
MEDIOCRE TRUSTS CAN EXPECT SOME 
VISITS IN THE COMING MONTHS

PRESIDENT BUSH HAS ARRIVED IN 
ISRAEL FOR A VISIT TO MARK THE SIXTIETH 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE 
STATE IT IS HIS SECOND TRIP THERE 
SINCE JANUARY HIS VISIT WILL FOCUS 
ON PEACE TALKS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND 
THE PALESTINIANS 
THERE IS TO BE A DEBATE ON ETHICAL 
DILEMMAS FACING DEMENTIA PATIENTS 
AND THOSE WHO CARE FOR THEM THE 
AIM TO DEVELOP GUIDANCE AND ADVICE 
FOR CARERS FAMILIES AND HEALTH 
WORKERS WHAT SORT OF ETHICAL 
DILEMMAS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT A A WHOLE HOST OF ETHICAL DILEMMAS 
ANYTHING FROM WHETHER TO TELL YOUR 
PARENT THE TRUTH IF THEY ARE 
WORRIED ABOUT A LOVED ONE AND ALSO 
THINKING ABOUT ISSUES SUCH AS 
WHETHER TO UNLOCK THE DOOR IF YOU 
ARE WORRIED THEY MIGHT WANDER 
OUTSIDE SOME COMPLICATED ISSUES L. 
THINK THIS GUIDANCE IS IMPORTANT 
IT CAN BE SUBJECTIVE IT VARIES 
FROM FAMILY TO FAMILY WHETHER THEY 
CONSIDER LYING TO BE AN ETHICAL 
THING PEOPLE MIGHT AGREE ON 
RESTRAINT BUT HOW EASY WILL IT BE 
TO COME TO CONCLUSIONS AND FORM 
GUIDELINES 
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT GUIDELINES IT IS A COMPLEX ISSUE BUT THAT 
DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULDN'T HAVE THE 
DEBATE I THINK THERE WILL NOT BE A 
ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH WE HEAR 
FROM THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES EVERY 
DAY TO OUR HELPLINE ABOUT SOME OF 
THE DIFFICULT DECISIONS THEY FACE 
WHAT ARE THEY TELLING YOU THEY THEY TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE WHETHER TO 
LOCK THE DOOR WHEN THEY ARE WORRIED 
ABOUT THE PERSON WANDERING OUTSIDE 
THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THINGS LIKE 
WHETHER TO SPEAK TO THEIR RELATIVE 
ABOUT PERHAPS THEIR HUSBAND OR WIFE 
WHO PASSED AWAY A NUMBER OF YEARS 
AGO AND THEY CAN'T REMEMBER QUITE 
OFTEN THEY ARE WORRIED THAT THEY 
ARE MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION AND 
ACTING IN THE PERSONS BEST INTEREST 
THEY NEED TO BE ADVICE AND GUIDANCE 
OUT THERE WE ALSO NEED TO INVOLVE 
PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA JUST BECAUSE 
YOU HAVE DEMENTIA DOESN'T MEAN YOU 
LACK CAPACITY TO TAKE ALL DECISIONS 
WE NEED TO LISTEN TO THEIR VIEWS
