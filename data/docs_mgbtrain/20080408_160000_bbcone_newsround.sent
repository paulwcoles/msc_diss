PLUS A DESPERATE 
BATTLE TO ESCAPE FLOODS IN PERU 
FIRST IT'S A MASSIVE NIGHT FOR 
THREE ENGLISH CLUBS IN THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE A WIN BAGS 
PLACE IN THE SEMI FINALS BUT DEFEAT 
COULD MEAN THEY END THE SEASON 
WITHOUT A TROPHY CHELSEA ARE UP

BUT THE BIG BATTLE IS AT ANFIELD 
WHERE LIVERPOOL AND ARSENAL ARE 
GOING HEAD TO HEAD SONALI'S THERE 
FOR US IT IS THE THIRD TIME THEY 
HAVE PLAYED EACH OTHER IN SIX DAYS 
BUT TONIGHT'S GAME AT ANFIELD IS BY 
FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT THE WINNERS

FINALISTS THE LOSERS WALK AWAY 
WITH NOTHING IN THE FIRST LEG LAST 
WEEK IT WAS ALL SQUARE BETWEEN 
ARSENAL AND LIVERPOOL THE SCORE 
WAS ONE TO ONE THAT AWAY GOAL GAVE 
LIVERPOOL A SLIGHT ADVANTAGE BUT 
NEITHER MANAGER WANTS TO DRAW

THE GAME ARSENAL CAN SCORE AWAY 
AS THEY HAVE DONE THIS SEASON IF IF WE HAVE BELIEF WE CAN WIN 
EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD WE TRY NOT 
TO GO TO PENALTIES BUT TO WIN IT

LITTLE BIT LOUDER THAN ANYWHERE 
ELSE 
IN THE NIGHT'S OTHER BIG GAME ELSE CHELSEA TAKE ON TURKISH SIDE 
FENERBAHCE THEY LOST THE FIRST LEG 
AND WILL HAVE TO COME FROM BEHIND
