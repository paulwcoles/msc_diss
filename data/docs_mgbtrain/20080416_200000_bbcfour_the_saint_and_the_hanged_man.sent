THIS IS A WORLD WHERE GOD INTERVENES ON A DAILY BASIS 
AND THIS IS A STORY ABOUT HOW TO TURN A DEAD MAN 
INTO AN AGENT OF HEAVEN 
A SAINT PERFORMING MIRACLES FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE 
NOT JUST SLEIGHT OF HAND BUT THE BIGGEST TRICK OF ALL 
THE MIRACLE OF RESURRECTION 
THE RESURRECTION OF A HANGED MAN 
A TERRORIST EXECUTED BY THE STATE 
BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE 
BY A HOLY GHOST 
BUT IN THIS WEIRD SUPERNATURAL WORLD 
A MAN'S SAINTHOOD WOULD BE TESTED IN A COURT OF LAW 
PITTING MAGIC AGAINST LOGIC 
USING FORENSIC EVIDENCE TO DISSECT THE DIVINE 
IT WAS DOWN TO THREE JUDGES 
TO PROVE IF A MIRACLE HAD OCCURRED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT 
ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVEN THE FULL WEIGHT OF JUDICIAL PROCESS DESCENDS ON HEREFORD 
BUT THIS COURT WASN'T SUMMONED TO PROVE INNOCENCE OR GUILT 
THE MAN ON TRIAL WASN'T A MURDERER OR A CRIMINAL 
IN FACT HE WASN'T EVEN ALIVE 
THIS WAS A HOLY INQUIRY 
A CALL TO PROVE WHETHER A DEAD MAN SHOULD BE MADE INTO A SAINT 
SSSHH 
THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF SAINTS IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
THEY HAD THEIR SHRINES SCATTERED THROUGHOUT EUROPE 
AND THEY PROVIDED A FOCUS FOR DEVOTION 
AND THEY MIGHT ALSO PROVIDE A FOCUS FOR MIRACLES 
PEOPLE WENT TO THEM IN THE HOPE OF HEALING 
WHEN THEY COULDN'T GET HEALING IN ANY OTHER WAY 
IT WAS A WORLD IN WHICH 
THE ERUPTION OF DIVINE SURPRISING SUPERNATURAL POWER 
TOOK PLACE FREQUENTLY 
THE INTERCESSION OF SAINTS 
WAS REGARDED AS A WAY OF CONNECTING PEOPLE IN THE WORLD 
WITH THIS OTHER WORLD WITH THE SUPERNATURAL 
IT WAS A KIND OF WHITE MAGIC IF YOU LIKE 
FOR A THOUSAND YEARS THE ONLY REQUIREMENT TO MAKE SOMEONE A SAINT 
WAS ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED IN THEIR SAINTHOOD 
FROM THE VIRGIN MARY IN JERUSALEM 
AND SAINT PETER IN ROME 
TO EDWARD THE CONFESSOR IN LONDON 
AND THOMAS A BECKET IN CANTERBURY 
BUT BY THE TIME DIVINE INTERVENTION WAS BEING CLAIMED IN HEREFORD 
THE RULES HAD CHANGED 
NOW ANY CANDIDATE FOR SAINTHOOD WOULD HAVE THEIR CASE TESTED 
IN A COURT OF LAW 
THEY THOUGHT THAT YOU COULD TEST FOR SANCTITY 
JUST AS YOU COULD TEST FOR GUILT OR INNOCENCE IN A CRIMINAL CASE 
OR TEST FOR THE RIGHTS AND WRONGS IN A DISPUTE OVER PROPERTY 
THEY THOUGHT THAT THE PROCEDURES THE CRITERIA 
WHAT YOU COULD APPLY IN THE CASE OF A CANONISATION 
WAS EXACTLY THE SAME AS WHAT YOU COULD APPLY 
IN ANY OTHER DISPUTED QUESTION IN LAW 
THE COURT WHICH ASSEMBLED IN HEREFORD CATHEDRAL 
WOULD BE EXAMINING THE CASE OF A FORMER BISHOP 
WITH A RATHER UNUSUAL NAME 
THOMAS DE CANTILUPE IS CALLED DE CANTILUPE 
BECAUSE HIS GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER CAME 
FROM A PLACE CALLED CANTELOUP IN NORMANDY 
AND SO HE BEARS IN HIS NAME THE SIGNIFICATION OF A NORMAN ANCESTRY 
HE'S NOBLY BORN HIS GRANDFATHER AND FATHER WERE BOTH STEWARDS 
OF THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD 
HE'S HIGHLY EDUCATED HE WENT TO OXFORD AND TO PARIS 
WHICH WERE THE TWO CHIEF UNIVERSITIES 
IN NORTHWESTERN EUROPE AT THAT TIME 
AND HE IS ACCEPTABLE TO THE KING 
AS AN APPOINTMENT TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT POSITION 
AND THE PICTURE YOU GET THERE IS OF A BISHOP 
WHO IS REASONABLY CONSCIENTIOUS IN DOING WHAT BISHOPS WERE MEANT TO DO 
SO FAR SO HOLY 
PHAT PLANET BY LEFTFIELD 
BUT THE ENQUIRY ALSO LEARNT THAT CANTILUPE 
HAD A REPUTATION FOR PICKING FIGHTS 
HE DOESN'T COME THROUGH AS AN ENORMOUSLY GENIAL PERSONALITY 
HE COMES THROUGH AS SOMEONE WHO KNEW HIS RIGHTS 
AND STOOD ON HIS RIGHTS AND INSISTED ON THEM 
BUT NOT SOMEONE YOU WOULD NECESSARILY HAVE MUCH SYMPATHY WITH 
YEAH HE WAS A FEISTY MAN 
I DON'T THINK YOU MESSED WITH THOMAS CANTILUPE 
IF YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE GOING TO WIN 
IN FACT CANTILUPE HAD A LONG RUNNING FEUD 
WITH THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY 
WHICH TURNED UGLY IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO 
CANTILUPE WAS PUBLICLY EX COMMUNICATED 
HE WAS AFRAID OF THE EX COMMUNICATION 
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE CAN UNDERSTAND TODAY 
HOW TERRIBLE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO A MEDIEVAL PERSON 
TO BE EX COMMUNICATED FROM THE RITES OF THE CHURCH 
AND ALL THE SIGNIFICANCE THAT HELD FOR ETERNAL SALVATION 
AND HEAVEN AND HELL 
SO IT WAS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT HE SHOULD REVERSE THAT DECISION 
BUT ON THE JOURNEY TO ROME TO CLEAR HIS NAME 
CANTILUPE UNEXPECTEDLY DROPPED DEAD 
IT WAS THE BEST CAREER MOVE HE HAD EVER MADE 
HIS BODY IS THEN BOILED 
BECAUSE HIS COMPANIONS WANTED TO BRING HIS BONES BACK TO ENGLAND 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO EMBALM THE WHOLE BODY 
AND BRING THE WHOLE BODY BACK SO THEY BOILED HIS BODY 
THE FLESH COMES OFF AND THE FLESH WAS BURIED IN ITALY 
THE BONES AND THE HEART SEPARATELY ARE BROUGHT BACK TO ENGLAND FOR INTERMENT 
AND ALTHOUGH THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY ATTEMPTS TO STOP THIS 
EVENTUALLY THE BONES ARE BURIED IN HEREFORD CATHEDRAL 
AND ACCORDING TO THE CANTILUPE CAMPAIGN 
THAT'S WHERE THINGS STARTED GETTING INTERESTING 
I THINK IT WAS EASTER MONDAY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN WASN'T IT 
WHEN THE FIRST MIRACLE IS ALLEGED TO HAVE HAPPENED 
EDITH ALCHRIST A MAD WOMAN WIFE OF THE BUTCHER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
WAS HEALED BY COMING TO THE TOMB OF NOT YET SAINT BUT THOMAS CANTILUPE 
AND THOSE EARLY MIRACLES WERE LOCAL 
THE MIRACLES THAT STARTED TO HAPPEN ARE THE CLASSIC KIND OF HEALING MIRACLES 
THAT IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONTRACTED LIMBS OR ARE CRIPPLED 
BEGIN TO EXPERIENCE HEALING AND REMISSION 
A CHILD WHO IS DROWNED WHO IS RESUSCITATED 
PEOPLE WHO WERE BLIND BEGIN TO BE ABLE TO SEE 
ANIMALS FALCONS WHO ARE HEALED 
PEOPLE WHO ARE POSSESSED BY DEMONS 
WHICH IN MODERN TERMS WOULD BE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING 
FROM MENTAL ILLNESS ARE CURED 
SHIPWRECKS WHICH ARE SOMEHOW SAVED 
HEREFORD ALREADY HAD ONE PATRON SAINT 
A DEAD SAXON PRINCE CALLED ETHELBERT 
BUT BY THE MID THIRTEENTH CENTURY HE'D GONE OUT OF FASHION 
SAINTS HAVE THEIR FASHIONS 
SOMETIMES A PARTICULAR SAINT BEGINS TO PRODUCE MIRACLES 
NOT IMMEDIATELY AFTER DEATH ALWAYS 
SAINT WULFSTAN OF WORCESTER WAITED OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
BEFORE HE STARTED PERFORMING MIRACLES AND THEN THEY BEGAN 
SO A SAINT WILL SWING INTO FOCUS AS THE NEW SAINT 
IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE AS HEREFORD DID 
OF GETTING RID OF YOUR OLD SAINT AND HAVING A NEW ONE 
YOU GRASPED THE CHANCE 
IT ADDED LUSTRE TO YOUR ESTABLISHMENT 
IT BROUGHT IN VISITORS AND PILGRIMS AND IT BROUGHT IN LOTS OF MONEY 
FOR THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH PILGRIMAGE WAS BIG BUSINESS 
SUDDENLY HEREFORD WAS AWASH WITH HOLY TOURISTS 
THE OLD THE SICK AND THE JUST PLAIN CRAZY 
THEY WERE PREPARED TO SPEND ALL THEY HAD ON THE PROMISE OF DIVINE INTERVENTION 
WHEN THEY GOT THERE THEY'D FIND A LOT OF ACTIVITY 
THERE WOULD CERTAINLY BE PEOPLE SELLING SOUVENIRS 
EACH SHRINE HAD ITS OWN BADGE YOU PURCHASED THIS BADGE 
TO SHOW THAT YOU'D BEEN ON PILGRIMAGE 
RATHER LIKE BUMPER STICKERS SAYING WHERE YOU'D BEEN 
AROUND THE SHRINE WOULD HAVE BEEN PLACED VOTIVE OFFERINGS 
OFTEN MODELS OF THE LIMBS WHICH WERE HEALED 
I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE WOOZY PLACES 
PEOPLE IN GREAT PAIN SOMETIMES EVEN CHAINED TO THE SHRINE 
AND THAT SOUNDS HORRIFIC TO US BUT SO DETERMINED WERE PEOPLE 
AND DESPERATE FOR HEALING THIS WAS OFTEN THEIR LAST CHANCE 
THERE WAS THE SPECIALITY OF STAYING OVERNIGHT 
AND IT'S VERY OFTEN THE CASE THAT MIRACLE ACCOUNTS 
REFER TO THE PERSON FALLING ASLEEP AT THE SHRINE 
AND SEEING A VISION OF THE SAINT DURING THEIR SLEEP 
AND THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE HEALED 
THEY WANTED TO TOUCH THE RELICS 
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED THAT THEY HAD PARTICULAR POWER TO HEAL 
AND SO THAT'S WHY THE RELICS WERE OFTEN IN A STRUCTURE WHICH HAD HOLES WITHIN IT 
SO THAT THE PILGRIMS COULD PLACE THEIR LIMBS OFTEN 
IN NEED OF HEALING ACTUALLY WITHIN THE TOMB 
AND TOUCH THE RELICS THEMSELVES 
SOMETIMES THEY EVEN GOT IN THEMSELVES 
AND SQUEEZED THEIR BODIES INTO THE APERTURES 
SO THAT THEY COULD BE RIGHT NEXT TO THE RELICS 
THERE ARE ACCOUNTS OF PILGRIMS GETTING STUCK AND MONKS LOOKING ON AGHAST 
NNNG NNNG NNNG 
AH 
YOU MIGHT MAKE AN OFFERING OF A COIN 
OR AN OFFERING OF CANDLES 
THE SAINTS EXPECTED THIS THERE ARE STORIES IN FACT 
OF SAINTS WHO GOT REALLY ANGRY WHEN THEY WEREN'T MADE THE PROPER OFFERINGS 
IT WAS MEANT TO BE A RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP 
YOU DID SOMETHING FOR THE SAINT AND THE SAINT DID SOMETHING FOR YOU 
BUT BEFORE YOU CAN CALL A SAINT A SAINT 
YOU HAD TO GET THE VATICAN'S APPROVAL 
WHICH MEANT YEARS OF LOBBYING TWENTY YEARS IN THE CASE OF CANTILUPE 
THEY WRITE TO THE POPE SUPPORTING THE CANONISATION 
THEY OFFER INDULGENCES 
THAT IS SPIRITUAL BENEFITS TO PEOPLE COMING TO VISIT CANTILUPE'S TOMB 
AND THE CATHEDRAL CLERGY OF HEREFORD 
PAY TO HAVE PEOPLE FURTHERING THIS CAUSE FOR CANONISATION 
THE INVESTMENT PAID OFF 
AND THE POPE INSTRUCTED THREE HOT SHOT LAWYERS 
TO SET UP COURT IN HEREFORD CATHEDRAL 
THEY USUALLY WENT TO THE LOCALITY WHERE THE SAINT HAD LIVED 
AND THEY HEARD EVIDENCE WITNESSES WERE CALLED 
THE WITNESSES WERE SWORN ON OATH 
AND THEY'VE GOT A DEFINITE LEGAL MODEL OF HOW YOU TEST FOR SANCTITY 
THE INQUISITORS I UNDERSTAND IT 
WERE UNIVERSITY EDUCATED CLERGY 
WHO WERE ON A CAREER PATH IF YOU LIKE WITHIN IN EFFECT 
THE MULTI NATIONAL CORPORATION AT THAT TIME 
WHICH WAS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
ALL THREE OF THEM HAVE LEGAL TRAINING 
ONE OF THEM IS WELL KNOWN AS A TAX COLLECTOR 
SO THEIR BACKGROUND IS ADMINISTRATIVE LEGAL 
HIGH UP ECCLESIASTICAL 
THE JUDGES WOULD LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED 
IN THEIR PURSUIT OF THE TRUTH 
BUT CANTILUPE'S SUPPORTERS KNEW THAT IF THEIR DEAD BISHOP EARNED HIS HALO 
IT WOULD CATAPULT HEREFORD TO THE TOP OF THE PILGRIMAGE HOT LIST 
ON A PAR WITH CANTERBURY OR EVEN ROME 
SO THEY PLAYED THEIR TRUMP CARD 
THEY TOLD THE JUDGES THAT CANTILUPE SPECIALISED 
IN LAZARENE RESURRECTION 
JUST LIKE JESUS HE WAS BRINGING BACK THE DEAD 
NORMAL MIRACLES ONE ENCOUNTERS IN MIRACLE ACCOUNTS FROM THE MIDDLE AGES 
ARE THINGS THAT ARE REASONABLY CREDIBLE 
RESURRECTION IS THE MOST EXTREME BUT IT DOES OCCUR 
AND IT OCCURS WITH SOMETHING LIKE MAYBE THE FREQUENCY OF TEN PER CENT OF MIRACLES 
OF COURSE IT'S GOT THE EXAMPLE OF JESUS IN THE BIBLE 
WHO HIMSELF BRINGS LAZARUS BACK TO LIFE 
AND THAT'S SEEN AS A MODEL 
AND IT'S SEEN AS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MIRACLES 
AND A THING THAT INDICATES MOST POWERFULLY 
THAT SOMEBODY IS A SAINT 
ACCORDING TO COURT RECORDS 
CANTILUPE'S SUPPORTERS PRESENTED EVIDENCE FOR THIRTY EIGHT SEPARATE MIRACLES 
SPANNING THE LAST TWENTY YEARS INCLUDING EIGHT CASES OF PARALYSIS 
FOUR DISFIGUREMENTS ONE LUNATIC 
AND THIRTEEN PEOPLE BROUGHT BACK FROM THE DEAD 
EACH MIRACLE WOULD BE SUBJECTED TO FORENSIC LEGAL SCRUTINY 
AND THE WEIRDEST CASE BY FAR 
WAS THE SPECTACULAR RESURRECTION OF THE HANGED MAN 
SEVENTY FIVE MILES SOUTHWEST OF HEREFORD 
LAY A FRONTIER TOWN KNOWN AS ABERTAWE THAT'S SWANSEA TO YOU 
SWANSEA IS A SMALL COLONIAL TOWN 
OVER THE COURSE OF ITS EXISTENCE 
IT HAD BEEN PLUNDERED BURNED CAPTURED RE CAPTURED 
DEFENDED OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
ENGLISH LORDS AND SETTLERS HAVE COME IN 
AND ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES BY FORCE 
THE WELSH HAVE RESISTED NATURALLY 
SO IT WAS CERTAINLY A TOWN WITH A VERY VIOLENT HISTORY 
IT WAS IN FACT AN OCCUPIED COUNTRY 
YOU COULD PERHAPS DRAW PARALLELS WITH IRAQ 
THE WELSH WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HAPPY BECAUSE THEY FELT 
PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN THEIR LANDS FROM THEM 
AND IMPOSED DIFFERENT LAWS UPON THEM BUT FROM THE ENGLISH STANDPOINT 
THEY WOULD HAVE FELT WE'VE WON THIS BY CONQUEST 
THIS IS HOW WE WANT TO RUN THINGS FROM HERE ON IN 
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT HARD LUCK 
MEDIEVAL SWANSEA WAS CONTROLLED BY ONE MAN 
WILLIAM DE BRIOUZE WHOSE ANCESTORS HAD CONQUERED ENGLAND IN ONE THOUSAND SIXTY SIX 
HE WAS A HARD MAN 
THE FAMILY LINE HAS A REPUTATION I THINK IN THE SWANSEA AREA 
FOR BEING A TOUGH UNCOMPROMISING FAMILY 
A LOT OF THE CONCEPTS WE NOW ASSOCIATE WITH THE GODFATHER FIGURES 
WOULD HAVE BEEN PART AND PARCEL OF YOUR WORK OR YOUR LIFE 
FAVOURING SOME INDIVIDUALS COMING IN HARD ON OTHERS 
YOU NEEDED TO BE STRONG YOU NEEDED TO BE FIRM AND DECISIVE 
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WILLIAM DE BRIOUZE WAS 
DE BRIOUZE REPRESENTED THE VERY WORST OF THE ANGLO NORMAN INVADERS 
WHO'D RECENTLY CRUSHED ALL OPPOSITION IN WALES 
WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO 
IS THAT EDWARD I HAD CONQUERED AND DESTROYED 
THE LAST NATIVE MAJOR WELSH PRINCELY DYNASTY 
BUT THAT WASN'T QUITE THE END OF THE STORY 
BECAUSE SOME WELSH RESISTANCE CONTINUED 
THERE WERE STILL MEMBERS OF THE OLD PRINCELY FAMILIES AROUND 
AND SOME OF THEM DID GO INTO REBELLION 
MEET WILLIAM APREESE AQUILIN 
ALSO KNOWN AS WILLIAM CRAGH OR THE SCABBY 
SWANSEA BORN AND BRED EXTENSIVE CRIMINAL RECORD 
SWORN ENEMY OF THE ENGLISH 
WILLIAM CRAGH WAS A LOCAL INDIVIDUAL FROM THE SWANSEA AREA 
AND A WELL KNOWN CRIMINAL 
I THINK THE ACCEPTED VERSION IS THAT HE WAS A BRIGAND 
A BIT OF A LOW LIFE A BIT OF A ROUGH HARD MAN 
WILLIAM CRAGH WAS ACCUSED OVER THE YEARS 
OF HOMICIDE ARSON PILLAGING AND OTHER CRIMES 
ALL THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE 
IS THAT HE WAS A MAJOR OPPONENT A MAJOR THORN IN THE SIDE 
OF THE LORDS AND SETTLERS 
MOST SIGNIFICANTLY CRAGH WAS SUSPECTED 
OF JOINING AN UNDERGROUND RESISTANCE MOVEMENT 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE HE DABBLED IN TERRORISM 
BURNING DOWN THE CASTLE WHERE LORD BRIOUZE LIVED 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY WHETHER HE WAS WORKING OUT A PRIVATE GRIEVANCE 
AGAINST BRIOUZE 
AND IT MADE SENSE THEN TO ACT AGAINST THE VERY SYMBOL OF HIS AUTHORITY 
THAT WOULD BE A MAJOR DEMONSTRATION OF WELSH RESENTMENT 
AND A MAJOR WAY OF BLOODYING BRIOUZE'S NOSE 
BUT BRIOUZE WAS NOT A MAN TO BE MESSED WITH 
HE HAD CRAGH HUNTED DOWN CHARGED WITH THIRTEEN COUNTS OF MURDER 
AND BROUGHT TO JUSTICE MEDIEVAL STYLE 
HE'D HAVE HAD NO RIGHT TO LEGAL REPRESENTATION 
AND I'M CERTAIN THAT A MEDIEVAL TRIAL 
WOULD NOT HAVE GONE ON FOR MUCH LONGER THAN A DAY IF THAT 
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE GONE TO A JURY 
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE REALLY INVOLVED VERY MUCH IN THE WAY OF EVIDENCE 
ULTIMATELY DID HE DO IT OR DIDN'T HE 
WELL WE THINK HE DID THEREFORE HE IS GUILTY 
WILLIAM CRAGH THE WORST OF MALEFACTORS 
WHO HAS PERPETRATED MANY WICKED DEEDS IN OUR LAND 
KILLING AND ROBBING AND BURNING IS GUILTY OF CRIMES AGAINST THE AUTHORITIES 
AND ORDERED TO BE HANGED FROM THE NECK UNTIL HE IS DEAD 
SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER THE CANONISATION ENQUIRY WAS LESS CONCERNED 
WITH CRAGH'S GUILT OR INNOCENCE 
THAN THE SAINTLY POTENTIAL OF A MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD 
AT NO POINT IN THIS DISCUSSION 
IS THE ISSUE OF WHETHER HE WAS GUILTY OR NOT IMPORTANT 
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING WHETHER THIS IS A MIRACLE 
A SAINT CAN SAVE A GUILTY PERSON 
JUST AS WELL AS A SAINT CAN SAVE AN INNOCENT PERSON 
IN FACT BY THIS TIME THE VIRGIN MARY'S MIRACLES WERE VERY IMPORTANT 
SHE SPECIALISES IN SAVING PEOPLE WHO ARE AS GUILTY AS HELL 
AND IT TURNED OUT CRAGH ALSO HAD A POWERFUL ALLY CALLED MARY 
LADY MARY DE BRIOUZE 
WHO BEGGED HER HUSBAND TO SAVE THE LIFE OF THIS WELSH TERRORIST 
IT'S ONE OF THE MYSTERIES WHY LADY MARY DE BRIOUZE INTERCEDED 
SHE IS PRESUMABLY QUITE A BIT YOUNGER THAN HER HUSBAND 
SHE'S HIS THIRD WIFE 
IT'S INTERESTING TO SPECULATE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT 
THERE WAS SOME ROMANTIC ELEMENT HERE 
THAT LADY MARY FELT ATTRACTED TO CRAGH 
OR IMPERILLED TO ACT IN A PARTICULAR WAY 
IT MAY HAVE BEEN PURE CHRISTIAN CHARITY 
SHE MAY HAVE JUST BEEN THAT KIND OF AWKWARD WIFE 
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY THE CASE THAT ONE OF THE THINGS HIGH BORN LADIES 
WERE MEANT TO DO IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
WAS TO INTERCEDE WITH THEIR HUSBANDS FOR MERCY 
SHE MAY HAVE JUST HAD AN ARGUMENT WITH HER HUSBAND 
AND WANTED TO PISS HIM OFF I DON'T KNOW 
SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER THE ENQUIRY INTO THE CANONISATION OF THOMAS CANTILUPE 
SUMMONED THE LADY AS A KEY WITNESS 
I ASKED MY HUSBAND TO SPARE THIS MAN BUT HE REFUSED 
IT SEEMS QUITE LIKELY THAT HE HAD A PARTICULAR SATISFACTION 
IN HANGING WILLIAM CRAGH 
THAT WAS MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES IN THE CANONISATION PROCESS 
FOR HIS WIFE THEN TO COME IN AND SAY SPARE HIS LIFE 
MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS AN IRRELEVANT FEMININE INTRUSION 
INTO A SATISFACTORY PIECE OF EXECUTION 
LADY MARY'S PLEA WITH HER HUSBAND HAD FALLEN ON DEAF EARS 
BUT IN A WORLD WHERE SAINTS DELIVERED THE IMPOSSIBLE 
SHE COULD INVOKE A HIGHER POWER TO SAVE CRAGH'S LIFE FROM THE GALLOWS 
WELL TO INVOKE A SAINT 
YOU HAVE TO NAME THAT SAINT 
YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY TO WHOM YOU ARE APPEALING 
THE SAINT YOU CHOOSE TO NAME 
IS OBVIOUSLY A SAINT YOU FEEL IS GOING TO DELIVER THE GOODS 
LADY MARY DE BRIOUZE SAID THAT SHE HAD A SPECIAL DEVOTION 
TO THOMAS DE CANTILUPE THAT IS SHE HAD ALREADY BEEN DOING THINGS 
LIKE MAYBE MAKING OFFERINGS TO HIM 
THAT EXPLAINS PRESUMABLY WHY SHE CHOSE AT THIS MOMENT 
WHEN SHE WANTED TO INVOKE A SAINT'S HELP 
TO CALL ON HIM SHE CALLED ON HIM BY NAME 
EXAMINED AS TO WHETHER AT THE TIME SHE OFFERED THESE PRAYERS 
SHE HAD FAITH AND HOPE THAT GOD WOULD HEAR THEM 
THROUGH THE MERIT OF THIS LORD THOMAS 
SHE SAID THAT SHE BELIEVED SO 
AND POURED OUT THOSE PRAYERS WITH DEVOTION 
PUBLIC EXECUTIONS WERE AN EVERYDAY EVENT IN MEDIEVAL WALES 
AND CRAGH'S WAS SCHEDULED FOR A NOVEMBER MORNING 
ALTHOUGH COURT RECORDS SHOW WITNESSES DISAGREED ON THE EXACT DATE 
IT WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN WINTERS AGO I DON'T REMEMBER THE DAY OR THE MONTH 
BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS AFTER MARTINMAS SOMETIME BEFORE LUNCH 
IT WAS BETWEEN MICHAELMAS AND ALL SAINTS' DAY ABOUT EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO 
I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS PEOPLE DISAGREE ABOUT TIME IS THAT IT ALL HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO 
THEY'RE GIVING EVIDENCE ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO 
AND EVEN IF YOU THINK OF TRYING TO RECREATE YOUR DAY SEVENTEEN DAYS AGO 
THAT'S QUITE A DIFFICULT THING TO DO 
SEVENTEEN YEARS EVEN IF IT'S A MEMORABLE EVENT LIKE THIS 
IS RATHER DIFFICULT 
CERTAINLY DATES FOR EXAMPLE WEREN'T COMMONLY COMPUTED 
YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE PRESS OR WHATEVER TO TELL YOU 
TODAY WAS FRIDAY TWELFTH OF MAY OR WHATEVER IT HAPPENED TO BE 
THEY DO HAVE WAYS OF MEASURING TIME 
BUT THEY HAVE MORE THAN ONE WAY OF MEASURING TIME 
THERE'S A WAY OF MEASURING TIME BY THE TWELVE HOURS OF THE DAY 
BUT THE TWELVE HOURS OF THE DAY ARE FLEXIBLE 
SO THAT IN SUMMER AN HOUR IS LONGER THAN IT IS IN WINTER 
CRAGH'S PUBLIC EXECUTION BEGAN SOMETIME AFTER DAWN 
ON A NOVEMBER MORNING IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY 
IN A CRUEL ABUSE OF POWER HIS OWN KINSMEN WERE FORCED 
TO LEAD HIM TO THE GALLOWS 
THE LORD INSISTED 
THAT WILLIAM CRAGH'S KINSMEN TAKE HIM TO THE GALLOWS 
AND INDEED ATTACH THE NOOSE TO HIS NECK 
I THINK IT SHOWS AN EXTRA MEASURE OF VINDICTIVENESS 
IN BRIOUZE'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS THIS PARTICULAR WELSHMAN 
CONDEMNED BY ENGLISH LAW CRAGH'S KINSMEN RESORTED TO WELSH CUSTOM 
IN A LAST DITCH ATTEMPT TO BARTER FOR HIS LIFE 
IN WELSH LAW IF YOU KILLED SOMEBODY 
YOU COULD RECOMPENSE FOR THE CRIME BY BEGGING PAYMENT TO THEIR FAMILY 
AS A REDEMPTION PAYMENT 
AND I UNDERSTAND THE GOING RATE IF YOU LIKE FOR A MURDER 
WAS ROUND ABOUT SIXTY COWS WHICH I WOULD IMAGINE IS A FAIR SIZE HERD 
IN FACT HIS FAMILY OFFERED ONE HUNDRED COWS TO SAVE CRAGH'S LIFE 
BUT NOTHING WOULD SWAY THE ENGLISH AUTHORITIES 
WHEN THEY WERE ASKED IF THERE WAS ANY CHANCE 
OF HIM BEING LET OFF THE HANGING BY SOME KIND OF SUBTERFUGE OR BRIBERY 
THEY ALL SAID THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE 
HE WAS SO HATED THEY WERE SO PLEASED TO GET HIM 
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT ANYONE COULD HAVE GOT HIM OFF THE HANGING 
CRAGH WAS ALLOWED A FINAL CONFESSION WITH AN ENGLISH PRIEST 
BUT IT FELL ON DEAF EARS BECAUSE CRAGH ONLY SPOKE WELSH 
THE JUDGES WANTED TO CLARIFY THE PRECISE METHOD OF EXECUTION 
HE WAS HANGED WITH A ROPE LOOSE AROUND THE NECK 
WHICH SUFFOCATES A MAN INSTANTLY 
IF THERE IS ANY QUESTION OF DECEPTION 
THE HANGMAN HIMSELF IS EXECUTED 
EVEN THOUGH THE WITNESSES ARE GIVING EVIDENCE 
SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS BURNED ITSELF QUITE STRONGLY ON THEIR MINDS 
AND HAS BEEN TALKED OVER OVER THE COURSE OF TIME 
ACCORDING TO MEDIEVAL CUSTOM 
CRAGH WAS LED UP A SIDE LADDER AND KICKED OFF 
DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PROCESS TALK ABOUT A SOMETIMES GRADUAL SLIPPING DOWN 
AND THEN THE ROPE WOULD TIGHTEN AT THAT POINT 
THERE IS A PRESSURE OF THE ROPE 
AROUND THE FRONT AND THE SIDES OF THE NECK 
AND THAT CAUSES THE FRAGILE VEINS 
THAT ARE JUST UNDER THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN TO BE COMPRESSED 
SO THAT MOST OF THE BLOOD THAT WOULD NORMALLY DRAIN FROM THE FACE 
IS STOPPED FROM DOING SO 
AND YOU GET A DAMMING BACK OF THAT BLOOD INTO THE FACIAL TISSUES 
AND THAT CAUSES THE FACE TO SWELL TO A CERTAIN EXTENT 
CAUSES A DARK BLUISH DISCOLOURATION 
THROUGHOUT THE FACE DOWN TO THE LEVEL OF THE LIGATURE 
BUT THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED WITH THE OLDER FORMS OF HANGING 
PARTICULARLY IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
WHERE THE PROCESS COULD BE DISTRESSINGLY PROLONGED 
UP TO TWENTY MINUTES FOR EXAMPLE 
IN A WORLD WITHOUT CLOCKS 
IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THE WITNESSES TO ACCURATELY JUDGE 
HOW LONG CRAGH WAS LEFT DANGLING 
WE HANGED HIM FOR AS LONG AS IT WOULD TAKE A MAN 
TO WALK A QUARTER OF A MILE AT AN ORDINARY PACE 
YOU'VE GOT THERE A DEFINITION OF TIME 
FROM AN EVERYDAY ACTIVITY BUT OF COURSE 
PEOPLE MIGHT WALK A QUARTER MILE IN DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF TIME 
AND AS FOR ESTABLISHING DEATH THE MEDIEVAL WORLD 
COULD ONLY RELY ON SUPERFICIAL VISUAL EVIDENCE 
WE BELIEVED HIM TO BE DEAD WHEN THERE HAD APPEARED 
THE CUSTOMARY SIGNS OF DEATH 
NAMELY THAT HE EMITTED HIS BODILY FLUIDS 
THROUGH BOTH THE LOWER ORIFICES 
PEOPLE CAN DEFECATE URINATE AND EVEN EJACULATE 
AT OR AROUND ABOUT THE TIME OF DEATH 
AND THIS OFTEN REFLECTS NERVE STIMULATION 
OFTEN BECAUSE OF DAMAGE TO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 
NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS 
IT CAN OCCUR IN THE PERIOD SURROUNDING DEATH 
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY IMPLY THAT DEATH HAS OCCURRED 
DEAD OR NOT CRAGH DIDN'T HAVE THE SCAFFOLD TO HIMSELF 
TO MAKE THE MOST OF THE GALLOWS 
ANOTHER WELSH CRIMINAL HAD ALSO BEEN SENTENCED TO HANG THAT DAY 
AND THIS TRAHAERN WAS A LITTLE ON THE PORTLY SIDE 
TO EVERYONE'S SURPRISE THE GALLOWS COLLAPSED 
BUT WAS THIS ACCIDENT DOWN TO A DODGY PIECE OF TIMBER 
OR COULD IT SIGNIFY SUPERNATURAL INTERVENTION 
THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY IS THE PERIOD WHEN THE WORD SUPERNATURAL IS FIRST USED COMMONLY 
THE IDEA WAS THAT THERE WAS A NATURAL WORLD 
WHICH FOLLOWED ITS OWN COURSE REGULAR UNCHANGING PREDICTABLE 
AND THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER REALM ANOTHER AREA 
WHERE GOD COULD INTERVENE MORE DRAMATICALLY AND MORE POWERFULLY 
IN INDIVIDUAL CASES 
SUSPENDING PERHAPS SOME OF THE RULES THAT GOVERN THE NATURAL WORLD 
WHATEVER THE CAUSE THE BROKEN GALLOWS LEFT THEM WITH A BIT OF A PROBLEM 
ALTHOUGH CRAGH LOOKED DEAD AND CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD 
THE ORDER WAS TO HANG HIM UNTIL HE WAS DEAD 
THERE ARE CASES WHERE WHEN SOMEONE IS SAVED FROM HANGING 
THEN A PARDON IS GRANTED 
BUT ON THAT DAY THE FIRST RESPONSE TO THE GALLOWS BREAKING 
WAS TO STRING CRAGH UP AGAIN 
AROUND AN HOUR LATER THERE WAS LITTLE DOUBT IN ANYBODY'S MIND 
THAT CRAGH WAS VERY VERY DEAD 
HIS TONGUE HUNG OUT OF HIS MOUTH THE LENGTH OF A MAN'S FINGER 
AND IT WAS COMPLETELY BLACK AND SWOLLEN 
WILLIAM'S EYES HAD SQUEEZED OUT 
HE WAS DEAD 
I DIDN'T GO NEAR HIM FOR FEAR 
WHEN QUIZZED ABOUT IT SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER 
AND THAT HE WAS AS DEAD AS 
THERE WAS AS MUCH LIFE IN HIM AS A STONE SAID ONE MAN 
CRAGH'S BODY WASN'T BURIED STRAIGHT AWAY 
BECAUSE THE NEAREST CHURCH WAS TOO BUSY 
WHICH GAVE WITNESSES THE CHANCE TO GAWP AT THE CORPSE 
HIS MOUTH NECK AND THROAT AND ALSO HIS NOSTRILS WERE FILLED WITH BLOOD 
SO IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE IN THE NATURAL COURSE OF THINGS 
FOR HIM TO BREATHE AIR 
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF LIFE NO MOVEMENT NO BREATH 
HE WAS COLD ALL THE SIGNS THAT HE WAS DEAD 
THAT'S THE THING THAT HAD TO BE ESTABLISHED IN FACT 
FOR IT TO BE A MIRACLE 
YOU HAD TO ESTABLISH THAT HE HAD BEEN DEAD IN THE FIRST PLACE 
OTHERWISE IT WOULDN'T BE A MIRACLE IT WOULDN'T BE A MIRACULOUS RESURRECTION 
IT WOULD BE A BOTCHED HANGING WHICH IS A VERY DIFFERENT THING 
WITH CRAGH SHOWING NO SIGNS OF LIFE THUS FAR 
HIS PROTECTOR LADY MARY DE BRIOUZE DECIDED TO TAKE THINGS FURTHER 
SHE'D SAID ALREADY SPARE HIM 
HER HUSBAND HAD NOT SPARED HIM AND HER HUSBAND HAD IN FACT SAID 
WHEN HE'S DEAD HERE HE IS SUCH AS HE IS 
SHE'S NOW SAYING WELL HE MAY BE DEAD 
BUT THAT'S NOT THE END OF THE STORY 
I CAN APPEAL TO A HIGHER POWER AND STILL MAYBE GET MY WAY 
I HAD FREQUENTLY HEARD TALE THAT GOD WORKED MIRACLES 
THROUGH SAINT THOMAS CANTILUPE TO WHOM I HAD SPECIAL DEVOTION 
WILLIAM CRAGH HAD BEEN HANGED TWICE AND HAD SUFFERED A GREAT PENALTY 
SO I ASKED SAINT THOMAS TO RESTORE LIFE TO THE HANGED MAN 
SHE IS INVOKING A SAINT 
WHO HAS RECENTLY HAD A VERY GOOD RECORD OF MIRACULOUS HEALING 
AND OTHER FORMS OF MIRACULOUS ACTIVITY 
HE'S AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS MIRACULOUS CAREER 
THE ENQUIRY WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO ESTABLISH PRECISELY 
HOW THE LADY HAD INVOKED THOMAS CANTILUPE 
AND WHAT PROMISES SHE HAD MADE TO THE DEAD BISHOP 
IN THE ENGLISH CUSTOM MY LADY BENT A SILVER PENNY OVER CRAGH'S HEAD 
THE ENGLISH SILVER PENNY WAS NOT ALL THAT BIG ABOUT SO BIG 
AND IT WAS MADE OF ALMOST PURE SILVER 
SO IT WAS ACTUALLY VERY SOFT AND EASY TO BEND 
SO BENDING A PENNY IN HALF WAS NOT ALL THAT DIFFICULT 
AND IT WAS A WAY OF EARMARKING IT AS A VOTIVE OFFERING 
THIS PENNY IS NO LONGER AN ORDINARY OBJECT OF MONETARY EXCHANGE 
THIS IS A PENNY THAT HAS BEEN DEDICATED TO THE SAINT 
TO WHOM I HAVE APPEALED 
ANOTHER METHOD WAS WHAT WE CALLED MEASURING TO THE SAINT 
WHEREBY THE SICK PERSON WOULD BE MEASURED 
WITH A LENGTH OF TWINE OR CORD 
WHICH THEN WOULD BE BOUND IN WAX AND MADE INTO A CANDLE 
THE PROMISE INVOLVED WAS THAT IF THE SAINT YOU INVOKED 
BROUGHT THAT PERSON BACK TO LIFE 
THEN YOU WOULD OFFER THEM A CANDLE THE LENGTH OF THAT CORD 
IT WOULD CALL THE SAINT'S ATTENTION 
HERE WE ARE ASKING FOR YOUR HELP 
AND THIS IS WHAT I PROMISE YOU IN RETURN 
YOU WOULD BE PROMISING A CANDLE OF THE SIZE OF THE PERSON 
THAT HAD BEEN MEASURED 
LADY DE BRIOUZE HAD DONE EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK 
BUT THE ENQUIRY STILL LOOKED FOR HOLES IN HER TESTIMONY 
WHEN YOU PRAYED DID YOU BELIEVE CRAGH WAS DEAD 
YES 
WHO WAS PRESENT AT THE MEASURING I CAN'T REMEMBER 
WERE THE PRAYERS AND MEASURING CONDUCTED ON THE SAME DAY AS THE HANGING 
YES ARE YOU SURE YES 
AT THE TIME YOU OFFERED THESE PRAYERS TO THOMAS CANTILUPE 
DID YOU HOPE AND BELIEVE AND HAVE FAITH 
THAT GOD WOULD HEAR THOSE PRAYERS 
THROUGH THE MERIT OF THIS SAINT THOMAS 
YES OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T HAVE BOTHERED IN THE FIRST PLACE 
WHAT THE PAPAL COMMISSIONERS WANT TO KNOW IS WHETHER THIS IS A MIRACLE 
AND FOR IT TO BE A MIRACLE THEY HAVE TO ESTABLISH CERTAIN THINGS 
FIRSTLY OF COURSE THAT HE WAS DEAD 
THEN THAT A SAINT HAS BEEN INVOKED 
THAT'S WHY THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT RITUALS AND WHAT PRAYERS WERE SAID 
OTHERWISE IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH 
THAT THIS PARTICULAR CASE IS A MIRACULOUS 
AND B. A MIRACLE TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO THOMAS OF CANTILUPE SPECIFICALLY 
ACCORDING TO WITNESSES SOMETHING AMAZING HAPPENED 
WITHIN MINUTES OF THE MEASURING RITUAL 
WILLIAM CRAGH MOVES A FOOT 
AND WHEN THEY WERE ASKED SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER WHICH FOOT IT WAS 
THEY WEREN'T QUITE SURE BUT HE MOVED A FOOT 
WILLIAM CRAGH HAD COME BACK FROM THE DEAD 
BUT WAS THIS RESURRECTION A BONA FIDE CANTILUPE MIRACLE 
THE HANGED MAN CERTAINLY THOUGHT SO 
WILLIAM CRAGH HAD AN ENORMOUS VESTED INTEREST 
IN THIS INCIDENT BEING CLASSIFIED AS A MIRACLE 
BECAUSE IF IT WAS A MIRACLE A SAINT HAD INTERVENED TO SAVE HIM 
AND THE CHANCES OF HIM BEING HANGED AGAIN WERE SLIGHT 
SO FROM THE WORD GO AS PEOPLE AROUND HIM SWUM BACK INTO VISIBILITY 
AND THEY BEGAN TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IT'S A MIRACLE 
HE HAD AN ENORMOUS VESTED INTEREST IN AGREEING WITH THEM 
AND EVEN POSSIBLY ELABORATING HIS STORY 
IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT FITTED IN 
WITH THEIR VIEWS THAT THIS WAS A MIRACLE OF THOMAS DE CANTILUPE 
IN FACT CRAGH TOLD PEOPLE 
THAT HE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY VISION WHILST ON THE GALLOWS 
WHEN HE WAS HANGED A CERTAIN BISHOP HAD SUPPORTED HIM BY THE FEET 
HE TOLD US A BISHOP HAD SAVED HIM 
IN OTHER CASES THAT ARE RECORDED OF SAINTS SAVING MEN FROM HANGING 
THE PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION IS THAT THE SAINT APPEARS 
AND SUPPORTS THE WEIGHT OF THE HANGED PERSON WITH THEIR HANDS 
THERE'S EVEN ONE CASE 
OF A SAINT SAVING TWO HANGED PEOPLE SIMULTANEOUSLY 
BY SUPPORTING THEM WITH TWO HANDS 
CRAGH'S ALLEGED VISION WAS ENTERED INTO THE RECORD 
AS LEGITIMATE SUPERNATURAL EVIDENCE 
VISIONS WERE REGARDED AS ONE WAY IN WHICH THE SUPERNATURAL 
LET'S SAY IN THE PERSON OF A SAINT WOULD MAKE HIS PRESENCE FELT 
A HEARER OF SOMEONE TELLING OF HIS VISION 
WOULD IN THE FIRST INSTANCE BE QUITE LIKELY TO BELIEVE IT 
IF THE DETAILS THEREIN WERE SEEMED TO BE AUTHENTIC AND SO ON 
I MEAN THE RING OF TRUTH 
BUT THE JUDGES STILL HAD THEIR SUSPICIONS 
THERE EXISTED REAL ALTERNATIVES TO DIVINE INTERVENTION 
FORMS OF MAGIC WHICH WEREN'T AS PURE BUT WERE JUST AS EFFECTIVE 
COULD CRAGH'S SURVIVAL HAVE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THESE DARK ARTS 
NEITHER HERBS NOR GEMS NOR ANY OTHER MEDICAL OR NATURAL THINGS 
NOR INCANTATIONS NOR SUPERSTITION 
NOR DECEITS HAD A PART IN WORKING OF A MIRACLE AS FAR AS I'M AWARE 
THESE PEOPLE WERE THINKING IN A WORLD 
IN WHICH THERE WERE MANY POSSIBILITIES 
THERE WASN'T SIMPLY THE NATURAL AND THE MIRACULOUS 
THERE WAS ALSO THE MAGICAL AND THE DEMONIC 
VARIOUS FORCES MIGHT BE AT WORK 
THEY WANTED TO EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY 
THAT MAGIC OR SUPERSTITION HAD BEEN AT WORK 
THEY WOULD DISTINGUISH SHARPLY 
BETWEEN WHAT WAS MAGICAL AND SUPERSTITIOUS ON THE ONE HAND 
AND WHAT WAS MIRACULOUS ON THE OTHER 
THEY WERE DOING THAT THROUGH RATIONAL PROCESSES 
THROUGH SIFTING EVIDENCE THROUGH CROSS EXAMINATION 
THROUGH ALL THE WAYS THAT THEY WERE FAMILIAR AT GETTING AT THE TRUTH 
BUT IT STILL ONLY AMOUNTED TO HEARSAY EVIDENCE 
AND THE JUDGES KNEW THAT EVERYONE IN THE COURT ROOM 
HAD A VESTED INTEREST IN PROVING THOMAS CANTILUPE'S SAINTLY PROWESS 
THE KEY WITNESS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE HANGED MAN HIMSELF 
UNTIL HE TURNED UP OUT OF THE BLUE 
AND WALKED STRAIGHT INTO THE CANONISATION ENQUIRY 
IT WAS A CHANCE TO HEAR WHAT REALLY HAPPENED 
STRAIGHT FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH 
WILLIAM CRAGH 
HUH 
PROBLEM WAS NO ONE IN THE COURTROOM SPOKE WELSH 
MOST OF THE WITNESSES SPOKE ENGLISH FRENCH OR LATIN 
WILLIAM CRAGH DOES NOT SPEAK ANY OF THEM 
HE SPEAKS WELSH AND ONLY WELSH 
AND SO THE COMMISSION IS SUDDENLY PRESENTED WITH A LINGUISTIC PROBLEM 
AN INTERPRETER'S PROBLEM 
AND THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE LOCAL FRIARY HEREFORD FRIARY 
AND FIND THERE A COUPLE OF FRIARS WHO KNOW WELSH AS WELL AS ENGLISH OR LATIN 
AND SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE THE INTERPRETERS SWORN IN 
BEFORE WILLIAM CRAGH CAN GIVE HIS EVIDENCE 
USING THE FRIARS AS TRANSLATORS 
WILLIAM CRAGH WAS ASKED TO CONFIRM HIS IDENTITY 
THEY INSPECTED WILLIAM'S NECK VERY CAREFULLY AND FOUND NO DAMAGE THERE 
BUT AT THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE HE HAD SOME REDNESS 
WHICH HE SAID HAPPENED ON ACCOUNT OF THE HANGING 
THROUGH THE PRESSURE OF HIS TEETH 
IF YOU HAD BITTEN YOUR TONGUE ON THE GALLOWS 
THEN DEPENDING ON THE SEVERITY OF THAT PROCESS 
THEN THE HEALING WOULD BE BY SCARRING 
AND IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE POSSIBLE TO SEE THAT SCARRING MANY YEARS LATER 
AS FAR AS FORENSIC EVIDENCE WENT IT WASN'T MUCH 
BUT IT WAS THE BEST A MEDIEVAL COURT COULD DO 
SO THE WELSHMAN STARTED TO TELL HIS VERSION OF EVENTS 
I WAS A POOR MAN LIVING WITH MY KINFOLK 
BECAUSE MY LAND WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM ME 
I WAS ACCUSED OF KILLING THIRTEEN MEN 
I DENIED MY GUILT BUT WAS TAKEN OUT TO BE HANGED 
ON THE FIRST MONDAY AFTER MICHAELMAS FIFTEEN YEARS AGO 
I WAS LED BY MY FAMILY TO THE GALLOWS 
THEY PUT A ROPE AROUND MY NECK 
THE INQUISITORS CHECKED 
WHETHER THIS WELSH CRIMINAL HAD EVER HEARD OF THE ENGLISH BISHOP 
YES I HAD I PRAYED TO HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE I WAS HANGED 
WE KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT WELSH MEN AND WOMEN HAD RECOURSE 
TO SAINTS OF ENGLISH PROVENANCE SUCH AS THOMAS AT HEREFORD 
SO IF THESE TWO PEOPLES WERE DIFFERENT IN MANY OTHER WAYS 
THEY WERE THE SAME WITH REGARD TO THESE SAINTS 
DID YOU HOPE AND BELIEVE AND HAVE FAITH 
THAT GOD WOULD HEAR THOSE PRAYERS 
THROUGH THE MERIT OF THIS SAINT THOMAS 
YES I DID I EVEN BENT A PENNY TO HIM ON THE MORNING OF MY EXECUTION 
YES I DID I EVEN BENT A PENNY TO HIM ON THE MORNING OF MY EXECUTION 
THEN AT THE GALLOWS I PRAYED TO HIM FOR MY SALVATION 
CRAGH CLAIMED THAT HIS FINAL UTTERINGS 
INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO THE ENGLISH PRIEST 
WAS ACTUALLY A SPECIFIC INVOCATION TO CANTILUPE 
IF TRUE THIS WAS POWERFUL EVIDENCE IN THE SAINT'S FAVOUR 
BUT THE JUDGES REQUIRED FURTHER CORROBORATION 
DO YOU RECALL WHAT HAPPENED ON THE GALLOWS 
THE LAST THING I REMEMBER WAS HEARING THE CROWD ROAR 
WHEN TRAHAERN WAS HANGED 
AFTER THAT I DON'T KNOW 
SO YOU DON'T REMEMBER THE GALLOWS BREAKING 
NO 
WHAT ABOUT THE VISION OF HAVING YOUR FEET LIFTED 
NO I DON'T REMEMBER THAT 
UNDER CROSS EXAMINATION CRAGH'S STORY HAD CHANGED 
HE DENIED HAVING ANY VISION ON THE GALLOWS 
BUT HE TOLD THE COURT HE'D HAD A DIFFERENT VISION IN THE MORGUE 
TRIGGERED BY AN INVOCATION OF THOMAS CANTILUPE 
AFTER MY LADY HAD MEASURED ME TO THE SAINT 
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT A CERTAIN BISHOP DRESSED IN WHITE VESTMENTS 
HAD PLACED MY TONGUE BACK IN MY MOUTH 
AND THUS I RECOVERED THE BREATH OF LIFE 
CRAGH WAS IMPLYING THAT CANTILUPE HAD RESPONDED DIRECTLY TO A CALL FOR HELP 
IT WAS GUARANTEED TO PLAY WELL TO THE COURT 
CRAGH WAS PROBABLY NOT STUPID 
HE KNEW WHICH WAY HIS BREAD WAS BUTTERED THERE 
IF HE COULD MAKE A CONVINCING CASE 
THAT HE HAD BEEN SAVED BY DIVINE INTERVENTION 
THAT IN EFFECT WOULD HAVE WIPED HIS SINS CLEAN 
AFTER THREE WEEKS OF EVIDENCE 
THE COURT WAS BUILDING A DETAILED PICTURE OF THIS STRANGE EVENT 
THEY HAD ESTABLISHED PRETTY MUCH TO THEIR OWN SATISFACTION 
THAT WILLIAM CRAGH HAD BEEN HANGED NOT ONCE BUT TWICE 
THEY'D ESTABLISHED WITHOUT MUCH DOUBT 
THAT A SAINT SAINT THOMAS OF CANTILUPE HAD BEEN INVOKED 
LADY MARY HAD SAID SO HE'D BEEN MEASURED 
THERE HAD BEEN THE BENDING OF THE PENNY AND SO ON 
THERE HAD BEEN EXPLICIT INVOCATION OF SAINT THOMAS 
THEY HAD VERY CLEAR EVIDENCE 
INCLUDING THE EXISTENCE OF WILLIAM CRAGH BEFORE THEM 
THAT HE WAS NOW ALIVE 
THAT IN ITSELF ALL ADDED UP TO A PRETTY STRONG PRIMA FACIE CASE 
BUT THIS WAS A TIME WHEN MAGIC AND DEMONS LURKED ROUND EVERY CORNER 
IT WASN'T ENOUGH TO PROVE THAT A SUPERNATURAL EVENT HAD OCCURRED 
THE JUDGES HAD TO MAKE SURE IT WAS A DIVINELY SANCTIONED SUPERNATURAL EVENT 
AND THEY HAD A LONG LIST OF UNHOLY ALTERNATIVES TO EXCLUDE 
ASKED IF FOR HIS LIBERATION FROM THIS DEATH 
EITHER BY HIM OR BY OTHERS THAT HE KNEW ABOUT OR HAD HEARD TELL ABOUT 
DEMONS HAD BEEN INVOKED 
OR ANY SPELLS CHARMS OR OTHER SUPERSTITIONS HAD BEEN DONE 
AND IF HE CARRIED WITH HIM IN PRISON 
OR WHEN HE WAS LED TO THE SCAFFOLD ANY LETTER 
OR IF THE KNOT OF THE ROPE WITH WHICH HE WAS HANGED 
ANY TRICK OR DEVICE HAD BEEN APPLIED 
SO THAT HE SHOULD NOT DIE AT ONCE ON THE GALLOWS 
OR IF ANY MAGIC TRICK HAD BEEN PERFORMED 
SO THAT HE SHOULD APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN HANGED AND DEAD AND WAS NOT 
THE WITNESS ANSWERED NO 
WILLIAM CRAGH MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE HAD SOME MAGIC AMULET 
AROUND HIS NECK 
HE MIGHT HAVE HAD A MAGIC GEM 
HE MIGHT HAVE HAD SPECIAL HERBS 
HE MIGHT HAVE INVOKED DEMONS AND ASKED THEM TO HELP 
ALL THESE WERE POSSIBILITIES 
AND THEY WANTED TO KNOW INTO WHAT CATEGORY DO WE PUT THIS 
AND ONLY IF IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR OWN CRITERIA 
AND THEIR OWN RULES OF EVIDENCE 
THEY COULD PUT IT FIRMLY IN THE CATEGORY MIRACLE 
WAS IT THEN ESTABLISHED AS ONE OF THE GROUNDS 
FOR CANONISING THOMAS DE CANTILUPE 
AFTER MONTHS OF DEBATE THE JUDGES FOUND 
THERE WERE JUST TOO MANY EXPLANATIONS 
FOR CRAGH'S RESURRECTION 
ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN CRITERIA 
THEY COULDN'T PROVE BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT 
THAT A MIRACLE HAD OCCURRED 
WHAT THEY BUILT UP IN THE END WAS A STORY 
OF WHICH YOU CAN GET A CONVINCING ROUGH OUTLINE 
BUT THAT AS SOON AS YOU TRY AND FOCUS ON VERY SPECIFIC DETAILS 
PARTICULARLY TIMING THEN THE STORY IS FULL OF SO MANY CONTRADICTIONS 
THAT YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY GET ONE SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD STORY 
ULTIMATELY THE CASE OF THE HANGED MAN 
FAILED TO STAND UP TO SCRUTINY 
IT WAS A TRIUMPH OF RATIONAL PROCESS OVER BLIND SUPERSTITION 
BUT THAT WASN'T THE END OF THE STORY 
THE JUDGES SPENT THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS 
EXAMINING THIRTY SEVEN OTHER MYSTERIOUS EVENTS 
THEY HAD TO SIFT THROUGH SIX HUNDRED FIFTY PAGES OF EVIDENCE 
A PAIN STAKING PROCESS WHICH DIDN'T COME CHEAP 
ONE JUDGE CLAIMED EXPENSES EQUAL TO ONE TENTH OF HEREFORD'S ENTIRE ANNUAL INCOME 
WHICH THE DIOCESE PAID IN FULL 
KNOW ALL BY THESE LETTERS THAT WE WILLIAM TESTER M. WEBB AND HOPE 
HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE DEAN OF HEREFORD TWENTY SHILLINGS STERLING 
FOR EXPENDING THE BUSINESS OF THE CANONISATION 
OF THOMAS DE CANTILUPE FORMERLY BISHOP OF HEREFORD 
IT SEEMS THAT MOST OF THE COSTS WERE BORNE 
BY THE CATHEDRAL CLERGY OF HEREFORD 
THEY WERE THE ONES WHO WANTED THEIR DEAD BISHOP 
TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS A SAINT 
AND THEY WERE THE ONES WHO WERE PAYING THE COSTS 
IN THE END HEREFORD'S GAMBLE PAID OFF 
BECAUSE AFTER CAREFUL ANALYSIS 
THE POPE'S LAWYERS RUBBER STAMPED TWENTY SIX EVENTS 
AS BONA FIDE CANTILUPE MIRACLES 
FROM GEOFFREY SON OF ROBERT 
CRUSHED BY A CARTWHEEL AND HEALED 
AND JOHN BURTON 
A CHILD WITHOUT A TONGUE IT GREW AND HE TALKED 
TO MARGARET DAUGHTER OF RICHARD BINK 
COT DEATH AT SIXTEEN WEEKS REVIVED 
AND AGNES DAUGHTER OF WILLIAM AND LETICIA 
SMOTHERED BY HER MOTHER IN HER SLEEP 
IN TOTAL EIGHT RESURRECTIONS WERE CONFIRMED 
WHICH WAS GREAT NEWS FOR THOMAS CANTILUPE 
AND SO ON APRIL SEVENTEENTH ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY 
THE FEISTY BISHOP WAS ENROLLED IN THE REGISTER OF SAINTS 
IT HAD TAKEN THIRTY YEARS SINCE CANTILUPE'S DEATH 
AN AVERAGE LIFETIME IN THE MIDDLE AGES 
BUT BARELY A HEARTBEAT IN THE STORY OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
AND FROM THAT POINT MONEY POURED INTO HEREFORD 
THANKS TO THE CANTILUPE PILGRIMS 
THE CATHEDRAL SPROUTED A NEW LADY CHAPEL 
A BRAND NEW TOWER 
AN IMPRESSIVE ENTRANCE A GIFT SHOP CAFE AND EXHIBITION CENTRE 
HEREFORD HAD EARNED ITS PLACE AS A HOLY HOT SPOT 
ON THE MEDIEVAL MAPA MUNDI 
A CONSTANT REMINDER OF THE WORLD OF THOMAS CANTILUPE 
WE DO SEE HEREFORD CATHEDRAL TODAY AS A PLACE OF PILGRIMAGE 
AND BY THE SHRINE OF SAINT THOMAS NOW WE HAVE AN INTERCESSION BOARD 
AND VISITORS AND PILGRIMS LEAVE THEIR PRAYERS 
THEIR DAILY OFTEN VERY MOVING PRAYERS 
AND WE USE THOSE IN OUR DAILY WORSHIP 
I THINK IT'S ALSO FASCINATING LOOKING AT THE PARALLELS 
BETWEEN CANTILUPE'S MIRACLES AND THOSE OF BECKET 
I THINK IT'S SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE INSTANCES ARE RECORDED AT BECKET'S SHRINE 
AND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY AT CANTILUPE'S SO THOMAS IS A VERY RESPECTABLE SECOND 
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED TO WILLIAM CRAGH 
BUT GOOD OLD THOMAS CANTILUPE IS STILL PATRON SAINT OF HEREFORD 
THANKS TO A SEVEN HUNDRED YEAR OLD PROCEDURE 
IN A WORLD OF CONTRADICTIONS 
THE PURSUIT OF REASON AND EVIDENCE ALLOWED A MEDIEVAL COURT 
TO ESTABLISH A MAN'S SAINTHOOD BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT 
AND FUNNILY ENOUGH OLD HABITS DIE HARD 
THE PROCEDURE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE EARLY FOURTEENTH CENTURY 
IS IN ESSENCE EXACTLY THE SAME PROCEDURE THAT'S USED TODAY 
THE PAPACY STILL REQUIRES PROOF OF MIRACLES 
FOR A SAINT TO BE DECLARED A SAINT 
REMARKABLY OF COURSE IF ONE WANTS TO SAY 
WHAT IS THE AGE OF CANONISATION 
THE AGE OF CANONISATION IS NOT THE MIDDLE AGES 
THE AGE OF CANONISATION IS NOW 
THE LAST POPE MADE MORE SAINTS THAN ALL PREVIOUS POPES 
THE AGE OF CANONISATION IS THE TWENTIETH AND TWENTY FIRST CENTURIES 
NOT THE MIDDLE AGES
