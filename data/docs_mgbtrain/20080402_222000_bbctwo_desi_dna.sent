COMING UP ON TONIGHT'S SHOW 
DESI D. N. A. LOOKS AT SOME OF THE ASPIRING STAGE AND SCREEN STARS 
OF THE FUTURE 
WE GO ON SET WITH GURINDER CHADHA DIRECTING HER LATEST MOVIE 
REWIND HISTORY CELEBRATES SOME OF THE MOST ICONIC HEROINES FROM THE WORLD OF BOLLYWOOD 
AND I GO IN SEARCH OF THE DESI OBSESSION 
WITH THE ONE AND ONLY KING OF ROCK AND ROLL 
THESE CHILDREN LIKE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS 
DREAM OF STARDOM 
FAME 
UM ONE AREA I'M REALLY GOOD AT IS DRAMA 
I SAID GOOD DAY 
DANCE 
SINGER MAKE A WISH TAKE A CHANCE 
NEVER THOUGHT IN A MILLION YEARS WE WOULD GET THE PART 
JUST A DECADE AGO YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD PUSHED TO FIND 
YOUNG ASIAN TALENT ON SCREEN OR ON STAGE 
IT SEEMS TIMES JUST MAY BE CHANGING 
AND IF YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT WHAT IT TAKES AND IF YOU WANT FAME 
THIS IS WHERE IT COULD START 
ALL YOU DO IS SIT ON A SOFA AND WATCH T. V. 
BUT SHEILA I LOVE YA 
I DON'T CARE YOU HAVE TO DO SOME THINGS 
THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY DREAM TO BE AT A THEATRE SCHOOL 
I WANTED IT SO BADLY AS A CHILD 
MY FATHER BEING ASIAN THOUGHT THAT ACTING SHOULD BE A HOBBY 
NOW I'M GETTING A SECOND CHANCE TO LEARN 
SYLVIA YOUNG RUNS ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS DRAMA SCHOOLS 
IN THE COUNTRY 
HER ALUMNI INCLUDES BILLIE PIPER 
EMMA BUNTON 
AND DENISE VAN OUTEN 
SO SYLVIA HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE CHILDREN 
AND YOU THINK TO YOURSELF THEY'VE GOT IT 
NOT VERY OFTEN NOT THE VERY TOP SPECIAL ONES 
BUT IT DOES HAPPEN SOMETIMES 
SOME CHILDREN ACTUALLY INSTINCTIVELY UNDERSTAND A SCRIPT 
AND THAT'S QUITE AMAZING 
SO HAVE YOU HAD A LARGE NUMBER OF ASIAN CHILDREN PASS THROUGH THE SCHOOL 
NOT AS MANY AS WE'D LIKE 
WE HAVE THREE OR FOUR AT THE MOMENT AT THE FULL TIME SCHOOL 
I THINK IT'S PRIMARILY BECAUSE MOST ASIAN FAMILIES ARE VERY KEEN ON EDUCATION 
ALTHOUGH THE REASON I THINK WE'RE NOW BEGINNING TO GET ASIAN CHILDREN COMING FULL TIME 
IS THAT OUR EDUCATION IS OF GOOD STANDARD 
IT'S A FEE PAYING SCHOOL THAT COSTS PARENTS OVER TWO THOUSAND A TERM 
BRAHMDAO ZARAH AND MARISKA ARE CURRENTLY TAKING FULL TIME LESSONS AT SYLVIA YOUNG'S 
THEY DO TWO DAYS OF DRAMA AND THREE DAYS ACADEMIC STUDIES A WEEK 
WHAT'S YOUR DREAM 
TO HOPEFULLY BECOME THE NEXT TOM CRUISE 
MY DREAM IS TO BECOME 
A BOLLYWOOD PRINCESS 
AN ACTRESS AND A SINGER AND MAYBE MODEL 
DO YOU THINK BEING SOMEWHERE LIKE SYLVIA YOUNG IS GOING TO HELP YOU ATTAIN THOSE DREAMS 
YES WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS SCHOOL THAT HELPS THAT THEN 
IT IMPROVES THE WAY YOU ACT AND YOUR SINGING VOICE 
WHEN I FIRST CAME TO THIS SCHOOL I WAS ALSO REALLY REALLY SHY 
UM BUT THEN AS I GOT TO KNOW PEOPLE AND STARTED TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS 
I GOT MORE AND MORE CONFIDENT 
AND ALSO THE TEACHERS GIVE YOU A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE SCHOOL 
AS WELL AS INTENSE STUDYING THE CHILDREN GET THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO AUDITION AND WORK ON BIG PRODUCTIONS 
HELLO EVERYBODY MY NAME'S MARISKA 
WHERE'S BILL WHERE'S BILL 
EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES 
SORRY IN THAT ROUND YOU BACKED ONE HUNDRED 
LET'S LOOK IN THE 
HE WAS IN THE POORHOUSE FIRST 
THERE ARE TWINS 
YA MAMBA 
ONE OF SYLVIA'S SUCCESS STORIES IS ACTRESS PREEYA KALIDAS 
WHO FIRST APPEARED ON SCREEN AT THE AGE OF TWELVE 
IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR SHE LANDED A LEAD ROLE IN ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER'S BOMBAY DREAMS 
MORE RECENTLY HE CAST HER AS THE NARRATOR OF JOSEPH IN THE WEST END 
THAT JOSEPH WAS THE SPECIAL ONE 
SO JACOB BOUGHT HIS SON A COAT 
WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL WOULD IT HAVE BEEN YOUR DREAM 
TO HAVE ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER PICK UP THE PHONE TO YOU 
GOD IT WAS BEYOND MY WILDEST DREAMS I'D NEVER IMAGINE THAT 
ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER WOULD ACTUALLY THINK OF ME 
FOR A PART LIKE THIS WHICH IS SO HUGE 
AND IS SO DEMANDING 
I DID READ AN INTERVIEW WHERE YOU SAID FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER 
I'M CAST BECAUSE I'M GOOD 
NOT BECAUSE I'M GOOD AND ASIAN 
IT'S BIZARRE I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS RECENTLY 
BEING A LITTLE GIRL AND REMINDING MYSELF OF WHAT VISIONS I HAD AS A CHILD 
WANTING TO BE IN THIS INDUSTRY 
AND AT THAT TIME YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT YOUR RACE 
YOU DON'T THINK IS IT GOING TO BE HARDER FOR ME BECAUSE I'M INDIAN 
YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT THAT 
COS I JUST REALLY ENJOYED WHAT I DID 
AND HE LOVED HIS COAT 
GOING TO SYLVIA YOUNG'S MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO PREEYA'S SUCCESS 
BUT IF DRAMA SCHOOL ISN'T AN OPTION THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES 
IN ROCHDALE SHENAZ KHAN HAS OPENED A TALENT AGENCY 
NICHE CASTING SPECIALISES IN PROVIDING ETHNIC MINORITY PERFORMERS AND EXTRAS 
SHE HAS AROUND TWO HUNDRED ARTISTS ON HER BOOKS 
ARE THERE REALLY THAT MANY JOBS FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES 
IN THE FIELDS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
THERE ARE STARTING TO BE MORE AND MORE OPPORTUNITIES 
FOR THE ETHNIC MINORITIES AS YOU CAN SEE ON T. V. 
SHENAZ'S CHILDREN HAVE ALL BEEN ATTENDING WEEKEND DRAMA LESSONS 
AT A LOCAL SCHOOL THEY COST JUST FIVE AN HOUR 
YOU MIGHT WELL RECOGNISE YOUNG JUNAID IN THIS WELL KNOWN CAR AD 
SAT NAV KEEPS 'EM OUT OF TROUBLE 
MY MOTHER BOUGHT US THAT 
OVER TIRED 
THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN DYING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF 
IS IT OH THEY'RE TIRED OR OVER TIRED 
OVER SO I HAVE JUST LOST THE BET 
OVER TIRED 
WHAT WILL BE YOUR IDEAL LUXURY PURCHASE WOULD IT BE A CAR 
YEAH PROBABLY WHICH A LAMBORGHINI LAMBORGHINI 
DO YOU NOT THINK THEY'RE A BIT SHOW OFFY 
THAT'S THE GOOD THING ABOUT THEM 
BRAND NEW FANCY A BUTCHER'S 
A CAR ADVERT SEEMS SAFE BUT WOULD SHENAZ ALLOW HER CHILDREN 
TO DO ANYTHING MORE RISQUE 
IF THEY WERE CAST IN A LEADING SOAP 
BUT THEY THEN HAD TO KISS A BOY MAYBE 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO COME IN TO ACTING 
THEN YOU'VE GOT TO REALISE THAT EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE 
COS IT'S ALL AN ACT IT'S NOT FOR REAL 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING NINETEEN YEAR OLD HARRY POTTER ACTRESS AFSHAN AZAD HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH 
SHE GOT HER LUCKY BREAK IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHEN SHE WAS PLUCKED FROM OBSCURITY 
HAVING HAD NO PREVIOUS DRAMA TRAINING 
I ACTUALLY GOT TOLD BY MY TEACHERS IN MY SCHOOL FORM CLASS 
THAT THE CASTING AGENTS WERE COMING ALL OVER YOU KNOW 
THE SCHOOLS IN MANCHESTER LOOKING FOR TWO ASIAN GIRLS 
AND THEN ME AND MY FRIENDS THOUGHT WE'D GO IN AS A COMPLETE JOKE AT FIRST 
WE NEVER THOUGHT IN A MILLION YEARS THAT WE WOULD GET THE PART EVER 
DO YOU SEE YOURSELF ALWAYS PLAYING THE ROLE OF AN ASIAN GIRL 
BECAUSE YOU LOOK ASIAN 
I'VE AUDITIONED FOR GIRLS THAT HAVE WESTERNISED NAMES AND STUFF 
AND I THINK THAT'S A GREAT THING COS IT'S BREAKING THE BOUNDARY 
OF ACTUALLY JUST GOING FOR ASIAN ROLES 
SO IT MAY NOT BE LONG BEFORE WE SEE AN ASIAN VON TRAPP FAMILY 
OR AN ASIAN PLAYING JOSEPH 
COULD THESE CHILDREN BE THE STARS OF TOMORROW 
I KNOW FAGIN'S GOT IM 
WATCH THIS SPACE 
FOR ANY DIRECTOR TURNING A BOOK INTO A FILM CAN BE A RISKY BUSINESS 
AND BOOKS WITH A CULT FOLLOWING CAN BE EVEN MORE OF A CHALLENGE 
ESPECIALLY IF THAT FOLLOWING HAPPENS TO BE MADE UP OF TEENAGE GIRLS 
ANGUS THONGS AND FULL FRONTAL SNOGGING IS A TEEN ROMANTIC COMEDY 
TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF MY LIFE AS THE NEW GEORGIA 
IT'S BASED ON THE BEST SELLING BOOK BY LOUISE RENNISON 
ACTION 
FRESH FROM BEING COURTED BY SOME OF THE TOP STUDIOS IN HOLLYWOOD 
DIRECTOR GURINDER CHADHA IS BACK IN THE U. K. 
ONCE AGAIN WORKING ON THE KIND OF GIRL POWER FILMS SHE GAINED HER REPUTATION FOR 
I WAS ACTUALLY ATTACHED TO ANOTHER PROJECT IN AMERICA 
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING DALLAS YES 
THEN DALLAS I FELT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN IT WAS LOOKING A BIT SHAKY 
AND THEN I BECAME PREGNANT 
AND SO I DECIDED REALLY I WANTED TO COME BACK HOME I WANTED TO BE BACK IN LONDON 
GURINDER FOR A GIRL HAS GOT THE BIGGEST BALLS 
IN THE BRITISH FILM INDUSTRY SHE DOESN'T CARE 
SHE'LL GO UP TO HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS AND SAY THIS IS MY IDEA MY PITCH 
AND THEY LOVE HER FOR IT 
BUT REALLY FORGET ALL THAT STUFF 
WITH A TITLE LIKE THAT THERE ARE ONLY THREE THINGS ON MY MIND 
WHO OR WHAT IS ANGUS WHERE DO THE THONGS COME INTO IT 
AND WHAT ON EARTH IS FULL FRONTAL SNOGGING I WANT ANSWERS 
FORTUNATELY I'VE BEEN INVITED ONTO THE SET 
GIVING ME THE CHANCE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS 
ANGUS THONGS FULL FRONTAL SNOGGING 
WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU UP TO 
WELL THIS IS A VERY VERY POPULAR BOOK IN FACT THERE'S EIGHT OF THEM 
THIS IS THE FIRST IN EIGHT 
AND THEY'RE BASICALLY BRIDGET JONES AT FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT TO BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM 
IN THAT IT'S IT'S AN ENGLISH FAMILY 
BUT IT'S MUCH MORE ABOUT GETTING A BOYFRIEND FOR THE FIRST TIME 
TRYING TO WORK OUT HOW YOU GO FROM BEING A GIRL TO A WOMAN 
HOW YOUR MUM AND DAD ARE JUST SO OBNOXIOUS ALL THE TIME 
AND IT'S ABOUT BEING BRATTISH AND SELFISH BUT FROM THE TEENAGER'S POINT OF VIEW 
I WANT A PROPER PARTY IN A CLUB WITH A D. J. 
THIS IS THE SIXTH FILM GURINDER HAS CO WRITTEN 
WITH HUSBAND PAUL MAYEDA BERGES 
WE HAVE A GREAT TIME WORKING TOGETHER 
AND I KNOW I'M IN SAFE HANDS WITH GURINDER WHEN SHE'S DIRECTING 
THAT SHE'S GOING TO DO IT IN LINE 
WITH THE SENSIBILITY THAT WE TALKED ABOUT 
THE BOOKS HAVE A BIG CULT FOLLOWING 
YOU'VE GOT TEENAGE GIRLS THAT LOVE THESE BOOKS IN THE U. K. AND AMERICA 
SO WAS IT DAUNTING DID YOU FEEL A PRESSURE 
TO STAY TRUE TO IT FOR THEIR SAKES 
IT WAS AN EXCITING CHALLENGE BECAUSE THE BOOKS HAVE REAL HARD CORE FANS ALL OVER THE WORLD 
AND YOU CAN SEE WHY THE BOOKS ARE REALLY FUNNY AND THE CHARACTERS REAL 
AND HER FRIENDS ARE ALL GREAT 
SO WE REALLY WANTED TO STICK TO THAT VOICE AND DO IT JUSTICE 
GURINDER HAS RECENTLY HAD TWINS 
AND THEY'RE REGULAR VISITORS TO THE SET 
WHO SAID NEVER WORK WITH CHILDREN OR ANIMALS 
AND ACTION 
I JUST NEED TO GET ROBBIE ON HIS OWN 
THE MAIN CHARACTER OF THE FILM 
IS ANGST RIDDEN TEENAGER GEORGIA NICOLSON 
PLAYED BY ANOTHER GEORGIA GEORGIA GROOME 
IS GURINDER GOOD AT GETTING IN THE MIND OF A TEENAGER 
YEAH GURINDER IS ABSOLUTELY WICKED 
SHE LIKES TO ACT THE CHARACTERS HERSELF 
AND SHE HAS THESE LIKE HORMONAL STROPS 
AND SHE JUST COMPLETELY LOSES IT LIKE GOES FOR IT COMPLETELY 
I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE FULL FRONTAL SNOGGING THAT'S YOUR DEPARTMENT IS IT 
THAT IS MY DEPARTMENT IN THE FILM 
IT'S BEEN GOOD IT'S BEEN GOOD FUN 
I THINK I'VE HAD ABOUT THREE DIFFERENT BOYS SO FAR REALLY 
IT WAS SCARY AT FIRST BUT AFTER THE FIRST ONE I WAS LIKE 
BRING IT ON 
MAKE UP PLEASE 
GURINDER HAS A REPUTATION FOR SPOTTING STARS OF THE FUTURE 
BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM LAUNCHED THE CAREERS OF BOTH PARMINDER NAGRA AND KEIRA KNIGHTLEY 
SO HOW DID SHE DISCOVER GEORGIA GROOME 
I AUDITIONED HER VERY EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS 
AND WHEN SHE CAME IN SHE WAS QUITE GIRLY 
AND I THOUGHT OH WHAT A SHAME IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK WITH HER 
AND SO I KIND OF MOVED ON HAD THE BABIES 
AND IN THOSE FEW MONTHS SHE CAME BACK A YOUNG WOMAN 
SHE WAS SORT OF MUCH MORE I THINK SHE'D PLUCKED HER EYEBROWS 
AND SO IT'S A BEAUTIFUL TRANSITIONAL POINT FOR HER IN HER LIFE 
AND WE'RE ABLE TO CAPTURE THAT FOR OUR CHARACTER ON FILM 
ANOTHER NEW TALENT BROUGHT TO THE SCREEN IS ELEANOR TOMLINSON 
WHO PLAYS GEORGIA'S BEST FRIEND JAS 
I THINK SHE KIND OF SEES HERSELF AS GEORGIA IN A WAY 
AND SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO REACT TO THIS 
AND THEN SHE WANTS YOUR OPINION ON HOW YOU WOULD REACT TO IT AS WELL 
SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY GOOD TO BE KIND OF GIVEN A CHOICE OF WHAT YOU WOULD DO 
THE TITLE OF THE FILM HAS GOT ME CONFUSED TELL ME 
WHAT HAVE THONGS GOT TO DO WITH IT 
THONGS ARE THE OPPOSITE OF MASSIVE GREAT BIG PANTS THAT GEORGIA'S FOUND IN WHEN LIAM 
WHO PLAYS PETER DYER CRASHES ON TOP OF HER INTO A FLOWER BED 
IN KEEPING WITH THE ENGLISH FEEL OF THE ORIGINAL BOOK 
GURINDER'S CHOSEN TO SHOOT AT A STUDIOS 
WITH A LONG HISTORY OF BRITISH COMEDY 
I LOVE EALING STUDIOS 
MY OFFICE IS HERE I'M BASED HERE 
I SHOT BRIDE AND PREJUDICE HERE ON THIS VERY STAGE 
IT'S VERY CONVENIENT FOR ME EALING SOUTHALL'S DOWN THE ROAD 
MY MUM'S DOWN THE ROAD SO SHE POPS IN 
AND ALSO I GREW UP IN EALING I WENT TO SCHOOL ROUND THE CORNER HERE 
SO IT'S VERY MUCH MY HOOD 
IS HOLLYWOOD NEXT FOR YOU 
I THINK THAT NOW THAT I HAVE THE BABIES AS WELL TO THINK OF 
AND I WANT THEM TO GROW UP IN ENGLAND NOT IN AMERICAN YEAH 
SO I THINK WE WILL BE LOOKING MORE TO WORKING ON OUR PROJECTS HERE 
LET'S SEE IF I CAN BRING HOLLYWOOD OVER HERE 
SO I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE THONGS 
AND THE FULL FRONTAL SNOGGING 
BUT WHO IS ANGUS 
ANGUS IS THE CAT IS ONE OF THE STARS OF THE FILM 
THIS GORGEOUS CAT THAT GETS COMPLETELY MAULED AROUND 
BY LIBBY THE LITTLE GIRL 
HE'S ALWAYS IN DRAG HE'S ALWAYS BEING DRESSED UP 
AND THIS POOR CAT PUTS UP WITH EVERYTHING 
IF YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT ANGUS'S STARRING ROLE IN GURINDER'S NEW FILM 
ANGUS THONGS AND FULL FRONTAL SNOGGING WILL BE IN A CINEMA NEAR YOU LATER IN THE YEAR 
WELL I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THONGS OR FULL FRONTAL SNOGGING 
BUT I'LL TAKE ANGUS ANY DAY 
MIAOW 
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN BOLLYWOOD WASN'T THE ALL CONQUERING MONSTER IT IS TODAY 
WHEN GETTING YOUR MUCH NEEDED FILMY FIX MEANT THE ODD BIT OF LATE NIGHT TELLY 
A HANDFUL OF CINEMAS OR MORE LIKELY YOUR MUM AND DAD'S GRAINY VIDEO COLLECTION 
BUT WHO DOESN'T REMEMBER THEIR FIRST SIGHTINGS OF THE WOMEN WHO TRANSFORMED ASIAN MOVIES 
AND IN DOING SO BECAME DESI DIVAS 
THEY INFORM US OF OUR HERITAGE 
THESE WERE WOMEN THAT YOU WOULD LOVE TO HAVE AS YOUR WIFE 
THE STRENGTH OF ASIAN FEMALES ACROSS THE CENTURIES 
ENCAPSULATED IN ONE BODY 
SO FROM NOOR JEHAN TO AISHWARYA RAI JUST WHAT MAKES A DESI DIVA 
I THINK THE DESI DIVA IS OFTEN A WOMAN 
WHO'S PUSHED BY EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES AND EVENTS 
INTO EXTRAORDINARY BEHAVIOUR 
THEY MUST BE BEAUTIFUL 
THEY MUST HAVE AN ELEMENT OF MYSTERY ABOUT THEM 
A TRUE DESI DIVA IS SOMEBODY WHO TRANSCENDS THEIR STAR QUALITY 
WHAT PEOPLE PERCEIVE 
BUT BRING THEIR OWN TRAGIC LIFE WITHIN THAT AS WELL 
BUT YOU LOOK GLAMOROUS THAT'S THE MAIN THING 
WELL IF IT'S GLAMOUR YOU'RE AFTER THEN SURELY EX MISS WORLD AISHWARYA FITS THE BILL 
AISHWARYA RAI SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN MY RASSMALAI 
BECAUSE SHE'S QUITE FAIR AND THE GREEN EYES OR BLUE EYES 
SOMETIMES I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT THAT A BIT 
PERSONALLY I'M SOMEBODY WHO 
WHEN I SEE A BOLLYWOOD ACTRESS I WANNA SEE SOMEONE WHO LOOKS INDIAN 
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING A PRIMA DONNA YEAH TOTALLY 
AND A DIVA 
I THINK AISHWARYA RAI IS PROBABLY STILL ON THE PRIMA DONNA LEVEL 
SHE'S YET TO CARVE HER NICHE 
WELL IF THE NEW MRS. BACHCHAN J. R. DOESN'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES 
WHAT ABOUT THE EQUALLY GLAMOROUS REKHA 
SHE HAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FACE 
THESE BEAUTIFUL LIPS THE BIGGEST EYES YOU'VE EVER SEEN IN YOUR LIFE 
HER BODY'S THIN HER CURVES ARE JUST OUT THERE 
SHE'S PERFECT I WANT A DOLL OF HER 
I WANNA HOLD THE DOLL EVERY NIGHT 
THE ROLE IS UMRAO JAAN WITH THE ASHA BHOSLE SONGS 
ANOTHER DIVA SINGING FOR A DIVA 
THAT REALLY WORKED THAT WAS MAGIC 
THAT WAS TRAGEDY THAT WAS EMOTIONS AND THAT WAS A LIFE UNFULFILLED 
AAAA A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. AAH 
A. A. A. AAH 
SHE IS ALSO THE STRENGTH THE STRENGTH OF ASIAN FEMALES 
ACROSS THE CENTURIES ENCAPSULATED IN ONE BODY 
REKHA I LOVE YOU 
BUT REKHAJI ALSO HAD ANOTHER VITAL FEATURE OF THE DESI DIVA 
A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP WITH GOSSIP COLUMNS AND MAGAZINES 
AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER TIMES WHEN I FEEL LIKE 
KISSING IT 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE BOLLYWOOD'S MEGA GOD AMITABH BACHCHAN UM 
DECIDED OH MY CAREER IS A BIT ON THE DOWNSLIDE 
HOW SHALL I REJUVENATE IT LET'S COME UP WITH THIS FILM SILSILA 
IN WHICH I WILL BRING MY WIFE OUT OF RETIREMENT THE ACTRESS JAYA BHADURI AND IT'S ABOUT AN AFFAIR 
WHY NOT GET MY ALLEGED MISTRESS REKHA TO ACT IN THIS FILM 
I MEAN IF REKHA SAYS HE EVERYBODY ASSUMES IT'S AMITABH 
BUT I THINK THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF PLAYING GOING ON THERE WITH THE AUDIENCE 
AND WHAT WE COME TO EXPECT OF THEM 
SO A DESI DIVA NEEDS TO HAVE A COMPLICATED PERSONAL LIFE 
PREFERABLY PLAYED OUT ON THE SCREEN 
BLOWING THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN FICTION AND REALITY 
BOTH REKHA AND MEENA KUMARI SPECIALISED IN WHAT I CALL 
PROSTITUTE FLICKS WITH A HEART OF GOLD 
ONE THAT ALWAYS OCCURS TO ME IS MEENA KUMARI DANCING IN PAKEEZAH 
THAT IMAGE AND THAT WHOLE DANCE SEQUENCE UM 
JUST DOESN'T EVER LEAVE MY MEMORY 
SHE DANCES ON THE BROKEN GLASS HEY HOW CLASSIC IS THAT 
IF YOU THINK OF MEENA KUMARI HER LIFE MIRRORED YEAH 
SHE WAS OFTEN PLAYING HERSELF 
YOU'LL HEAR THE PAIN SHE'S GOING THROUGH AND THAT PAIN IS ACTUALLY HER KNOWING THAT SHE'S COME BACK 
AND SHE'S FINISHING THIS FILM WITH HER HUSBAND WHO SHE LEFT 
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE ALL LOVE IT SO MUCH IS BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING THE REAL MEANING OF KUMARI 
SHE SPLIT FROM HER HUSBAND WHILE MAKING THE FILM 
UM SHE DIED OF CIRRHOSIS A FEW DAYS AFTER THE FILM RELEASED 
SHE DIDN'T HAVE A HAPPY LIFE 
THERE WAS THIS HUGE THING ABOUT WHETHER SHE TOPPED HERSELF OR NOT 
SO SHE WAS IN THE PAPERS THE FILM WAS OPENING 
THE SONGS WERE PLAYING YOU KNOW 
BUT I THINK AFTER DEATH SHE'S BEEN AN EVEN MORE CELEBRATED FIGURE 
PERHAPS THAN SHE WAS IN HER LIFETIME 
IN FACT FOR ANY TRUE DESI DIVA A GLAMOROUS LIFE FOLLOWED BY A TRAGIC DEATH 
ONLY ADDS TO THE MYSTIQUE 
WHEN YOU DIE 
IT ELEVATES YOUR DIVA STATUS YEAH THAT'S TRUE 
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE'D SAY NOOR JEHAN COS ONCE YOU DIE 
ALL YOUR MISTAKES ARE FORGIVEN AND EVERYBODY KISSES YOUR 
DIL D. A. JAANI 
SAI OONI M. E. R. A. DIL D. A. JAANI 
NOOR JEHAN WHAT FIVE SLASH SIX HUSBANDS 
LOST COUNT YEAH SHE WAS THE ELIZABETH TAYLOR IS A DIVA 
NOOR JEHAN WAS THE BOLLYWOOD OR THE ASIAN EQUIVALENT 
FULL ON MAKE UP THOSE EYES 
IF YOU TALK ABOUT MEENA KUMARI AND REKHA AND YOU TALK ABOUT NOOR JEHAN WHEN THEY 
IT WAS LOOKED DOWN UPON BECOMING AN ACTRESS OR A SINGER 
IT WAS WHAT A WHORE WOULD DO WHAT DID THEY DO 
THEY WENT OFF MADE LOADS OF MONEY LOOKED FANTASTIC THE WORLD LOVES THEM 
AND THEY TOOK CONTROL OF THEIR LIVES AND THEY'VE INSPIRED WOMEN 
EVERYONE LOVES A WHORE SO AFTER ALL THE DRAMA AND TRAGEDY WHAT'S THE ESSENCE OF A DESI DIVA 
I WOULD SAY IT'S A STRONG INDIAN WOMAN WHO CHALLENGES THE ESTABLISHED NORMS OF INDIAN SOCIETY 
BREAKS FREE AND EMERGES TRIUMPHANT 
BUT WHO TRIUMPHS AS THE ULTIMATE DIVA 
AISHWARYA RAI IS A NON RUNNER STRIKE NON RUNNER PRIMA DONNA 
SO NOOR NOOR JEHAN MALLIKA E. TARRANUM AS SHE WAS CALLED NOOR JEHAN 
WOULD YOU SAY NOOR JEHAN I WOULD SAY HER 
BOLLYWOOD'S ULTIMATE DIVA HAS TO BE THE GORGEOUS REKHA 
REKHA IS PRETTY HIGH UP ON MY LIST OF FAVOURITES 
MEENA KUMARI IS DEFINITELY ONE OF MY SORT OF 
ICONIC KIND OF ACTRESSES 
NO I LIKE MADAME NOOR JEHAN BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU WON'T SEE SOMEONE LIKE THAT AGAIN 
TO ME THE WORD DESI DIVA SHOULD BE WRITTEN ACROSS REKHA'S FOREHEAD 
FOR ALL YOU ROCK'N'ROLLERS YOU'LL KNOW THE SIGNIFICANCE OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO'VE NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD 
WHY YOUR DAD HAD THE LONG SIDEBURNS AND THE BIG QUIFF IT'S ALL ABOUT TO MAKE SENSE 
THIS YEAR SEES THE ANNIVERSARY OF ONE OF THE BIGGEST EVENTS IN ROCK'N'ROLL HISTORY 
IT'S EXACTLY FORTY YEARS SINCE ELVIS MADE HIS NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT COMEBACK SPECIAL 
WHEN ELVIS DECIDED TO RELAUNCH HIS CAREER AT THE AGE OF THIRTY THREE 
HE WAS TAKING ONE OF THE BIGGEST GAMBLES OF HIS LIFE 
AND THOUGH HE MAY HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT HOW HIS FANS AT HOME WOULD REACT 
IN INDIA HE HE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT 
TIME FOR BREAKFAST 
HI POP 
GOOD MORNING ELVIS 
FROM HAIR TO FLARES BOLLYWOOD TO BHANGRA THE IMPACT OF ELVIS ON ASIAN LIFE 
IS HARD TO IGNORE 
I KNOW IT SOUNDS VERY STRANGE BUT HE LOOKED INDIAN 
HE'S GOT SUCH A MAGNETIC PERSONALITY 
IN BHANGRA WE WERE SWINGING HIPS ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
SO HERE WAS SOMEBODY WHO WAS BEING INDIAN HIMSELF 
THE COOLEST LOOKING BROTHER 
IN THIS BLACK LEATHER JACKET AND THE BLACK LEATHER TROUSERS 
UH HUH HUH 
PERSONALLY I'M NOT HUGE FAN OF ELVIS 
BUT I'M KEEN TO FIND OUT WHY HE'S SUCH AN ASIAN ICON 
AM I MISSING OUT ON SOMETHING 
I'M GOING TO MEET TWO OF ELVIS'S BIGGEST ADMIRERS 
TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS ABOUT THIS GLOBAL SUPERSTAR 
THAT MADE HIM SUCH A HIT WITH ASIAN FANS 
I GAVE THE LETTER TO THE POSTMAN 
SAL BASHIR IS A ONE MAN ELVIS TRIBUTE ACT 
I DON'T ADVERTISE MYSELF AS THE ASIAN ELVIS 
OR THE PAKISTANI ELVIS 
IF ANY ONE WANTS TO DO THAT THEN THAT'S FINE COS IT'S THE TRUTH ANYWAY 
SAL GAVE UP A CAREER IN THE CITY TO PURSUE HIS ONE TRUE PASSION 
PERFORMING ELVIS FOR ADORING FANS ACROSS THE NATION 
I KNOW IT SOUNDS VERY STRANGE BUT HE LOOKED INDIAN 
IF YOU LOOK AT ONE OR TWO OF THE FILMS HE MADE 
HE WAS VERY DARK AND WITH THE BLACK HAIR AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
WELL THE PAKISTANI AND INDIAN PEOPLE THEY ALL TOOK TO HIM 
OUR DADS ALL HAD THE SIDEBURNS AND THE BIG HAIR THEY MUST HAVE GOT THAT FROM HIM 
YOU KNOW BOLLYWOOD IS ALL ABOUT CHARISMA IT'S ALL ABOUT PERSONALITIES 
IT'S ALL ABOUT THAT MAGNETISM 
WELL ELVIS HAD IT IN TRUCKLOADS 
ELVIS HAD TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR BLACK ARTISTS 
HE HAD BLACK ARTISTS UP ON STAGE WITH HIM SINGING WITH HIM 
HE OPENLY ADMITTED THAT HE GOT HIS INFLUENCES FROM BLACK MUSIC 
ADDRESS UNKNOWN 
FOR SAL PERFORMING ELVIS IS A WAY OF CELEBRATING THE MUSIC OF THE KING 
FOR OTHERS HIS LEGENDARY PERSONA GIVES THEM A CHANCE TO DO A LITTLE GOOD IN THE WORLD 
I'VE COME TO MEET SOMEONE WHO USES THE POWER OF ELVIS TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE 
IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY 
I'M HERE TO SEE DOCTOR ELV SORRY DOCTOR DANDAPAT 
THROUGH THERE THANKS 
COME IN 
DON'T BE CRUEL TO A HEART THAT'S TRUE 
I'M NOT TOO GREAT TO BE HONEST I FEEL ALL SHOOK UP 
YOU GOT ME THERE 
IN INDIA IS ELVIS REALLY BIG HE IS REALLY BIG 
EVEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT BORN DURING HIS TIME LOVE HIS MUSIC 
FROM SCHOOL DAYS I'D ALWAYS LOVED SINGING 
I THOUGHT LET'S TRY AND IMITATE THE GUY 
AT THAT TIME I HAD PLENTY OF HAIR SO I HAD THESE CURLS 
AND SANG HIS SONGS 
THE GOOD DOCTOR DISCOVERED THAT HE COULD RAISE MONEY FOR CHARITY 
BY PERFORMING AS ELVIS AT WORMWOOD SCRUBS PRISON 
WHENEVER I DRESSED AND CAME ONTO THE STAGE 
IMMEDIATELY PEOPLE ALL STARTED CLAPPING AND SCREAMING AND SHOUTING 
DON'T BE CRUEL TO A HEART THAT'S TRUE 
WHAT IS IT ABOUT ELVIS THAT APPEALS SPECIFICALLY WHEN YOU'RE DOING CHARITY WORK 
HE GAVE TO THE POOR HE HELPED THEM 
AND THAT'S WHAT I LOVE DOING 
BABY IT'S JUST YOU I'M 
THE OUTFIT THE DOCTOR IS WEARING IS FROM THE ELVIS MOVIE ALOHA FROM HAWAII 
WHICH COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN WORN ON A BOLLYWOOD SET 
WHEN DESI D. N. A. SAID ADIL WE'RE SENDING YOU ON THE TRAIL OF ELVIS 
I THOUGHT GRACELANDS LAS VEGAS BABY 
SO WHY AM I IN SKEGNESS VIVA LAS VEGAS 
THE REASON I'M AT THIS SEASIDE METROPOLIS IS TO SEE SAL PERFORM TONIGHT 
VIVA LAS VEGAS 
I'VE EVEN MANAGED TO GET MYSELF A RIDE LIKE ELVIS 
WELL THE KING ALWAYS LOVED A BIT OF BLING 
O. K. SO THIS IS ALL YOUR STUFF MAN UM THIS IS ALL MY WARDROBE 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DECIDE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WEAR TONIGHT 
I WORE THIS SUIT LAST NIGHT WHICH IS BASED ON A SUIT THAT ELVIS WORE IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE 
WHEN HE MADE HIS COMEBACK THAT'S QUITE INDIAN ISN'T IT 
IT'S GOT A REAL ASIAN SORT OF YEAH EMBROIDERY THING TO IT 
I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE FAVOURITE IS THE FAMOUS AND DEFINITELY LEGENDARY ICONIC 
NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT FAMOUS LEATHER SUIT THAT HE WORE 
SEE THE GIRL WITH THE RED DRESS ON 
SHE'S THE GIRL THAT ROCKS ALL NIGHT LONG 
IT'S A PROFESSIONAL CAREER NOW ISN'T IT FOR YOU IT IS 
WHY WHAT WAS THE BIG APPEAL 
WHEN I FIRST HEARD ELVIS BACK IN THE LATE SIXTIES IT WAS HEADLINE NEWS FOR ME 
MY SISTER BROUGHT IN A RECORD AND WE PUT IT ON MY DAD'S OLD RADIOGRAM 
AND WHEN IT WARMED UP IT PLAYED THIS FANTASTIC SONG 
IF I CAN MAKE SOMEBODY HAPPY BY REMINDING THEM OF ELVIS'S VOICE 
THEN THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO 
AT THE BEGINNING I WASN'T SURE ABOUT ELVIS 
BUT THERE'S NO DENYING THE KING'S ICONIC STATUS 
HIS FAN BASE IS SPREAD ALL OVER THE WORLD AND TRANSCENDS CULTURES 
FORTY YEARS ON FROM HIS BIG COMEBACK ELVIS'S MUSIC STILL ROCKS 
A LITTLE LESS CONVERSATION A LITTLE MORE ACTION PLEASE 
ALL THIS AGGRAVATION AIN'T SATISFACTIONING ME 
A LITTLE MORE BITE A LITTLE LESS BARK 
SAL'S EVEN GOT ME DANCING 
WELL KIND OF 
THANKS FOR COMING I THINK I'M CONVERTED MATE 
ELVIS WOULD BE VERY PROUD OF ME TONIGHT TAKE CARE MAN 
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT THANK YOU CHEERS 
I THINK I CAN DO THE LINE NOW 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SAL OR ELVIS HAS NOW LEFT THE BUILDING
