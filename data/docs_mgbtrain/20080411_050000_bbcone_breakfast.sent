I HAD TO SELL HER BUNGALOW THE 
PLACE SHE LOVED TO GENERATE ENOUGH 
MONEY TO PAY THE FEES 
GOOD MORNING IT'S FRIDAY APRIL 
ELEVENTH ELEVENTH ALSO AHEAD BIG BROTHER THE 
COUNCIL THAT SPIED ON A FAMILY TO 
SEE IF THEY WERE LYING ABOUT BEING 
IN A SCHOOL CATCHMENT AREA 
IN THE CLEAR A CONTROVERSIAL D. N. A. 
TECHNIQUE IS GIVING THE GO AHEAD BY 
GOVERNMENT SCIENTISTS 
AND THE BANK OF ENGLAND CUTS 
INTEREST RATES BY ONE QUARTER OF 
ONE PER CENT SO WHY IS IT THAT OUR 
HOME LOANS LOOK SET TO BECOME MORE 
EXPENSIVE EXPENSIVE BRITAIN IN BLOOM JUSTIN ROSE LEADS 
THE MASTERS AT AUGUSTA AFTER AN 
EVENTFUL OPENING ROUND 
AND THE WEATHER ONE OF SUNSHINE 
AND SHOWERS HEF Y. WITH THUNDER 
AND IN FIFTEEN MINUTES' TIME I WILL BE 
EXPLAINING WHY I'M IN A CAR MARK IN 
NOTTINGHAM WITH A LED OF MEN IN 
CLASSIC CARS FIRST OUR MAIN STORY 
THOUSANDS OF ELDERLY PEOPLE IN 
ENGLAND ARE BEING FORCED TO PAY FOR 
LONG TERM CARE THEY SHOULD BE 
GETTING FOR FREE ACCORDK TO THE 
CHARITY AGE CONCERN WHO TOLD 
BREAKFAST THAT OLDER PEOPLE WITH 
SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE BEING 
ROUTINELY FAILED BY THE N. H. S. 
DESPITE NEW GUIDELINES 
A LATEST FIGURE SHOW A DROP IN THE 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE GETTING THE 
FUNDING THEY ARE ENTITLED TO 
THIS IS A PHOTO OF MY MOTHER L. 
GUESS TAKEN IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY MEMORIES 
OF YOUTH BUT IN OLD AGE ELIZABETH'S 
MER SUFFERED FROM DEMENTIA SHE 
NEEDED FOUR YEARS' CARE IN A 
NURSING HOME CARE ELIZABETH PAID 
FOR BUT SHE LATER FOUND OUT THAT 
THE N. H. S. SHOULD HAVE PICKED UP THE 
BILL 
I HAD TO SELL HER BUNGALOW BILL THE PLACE SHE LOVED TO GENERATE 
ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY THE FEES YOU 
THINK WHY SHOULD I DO THIS WHEN 
FOR ANY OTHER ILLNESS YOU WOULDN'T 
BE FORCED TO DO THIS 
AFTER A LONG 
BATTLE SHE FINALLY WON 
COMPENSATION CARE ADVICE CENTRES 
LIKE THIS ONE OFTEN HELP TO PEOPLE 
AROUND THE COUNTRY ADVISORS HERE 
SAY MANY CALLS ARE FROM PEOPLE 
CONFUSED ABOUT HOW THEY WILL BE 
CARED FOR AND WHO WILL PAY FOR IT 
THE SITUATION WAS SUPPOSED TO GET 
EASIER IN OCTOBER LAST YEAR THE 
GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED NEW 
GUIDELINES TO END REGIONAL 
VARIATIONS IN THE WAY LONG TERM 
CARE FUNDING IS ALLOCATED BUT N. H. S. 
FIGURES ANALYSED BY AGE CONCERN 
AND GIVEN TO THE B. B. C. SUGGEST THE 
POSTCODE LOTTERY HAS GOT WORSE WE WE ARE STILL SEEING MANY PRIMARY CARE 
TRUSTS WITHIN THE N. H. S. OFFERING 
OUTRAGEOUSLY LOW LEVELS OF SUPPORT 
IT PEOPLE WITH REALLY QUITE 
DESPERATE NEEDS AND THE DISPARITY 
FROM ONE TRUST TO ANOTHER 
SOMETIMES NEIGHBOURING TRUSTS IS 
BE A SLAUGHTLY ENORMOUS AGE AGE CONCERN HIGHLIGHTS GLOUCESTERSHIRE 
PRIMARY CARE TRUST AS THE WORST 
PROVIDER OF FUNDING IN ENGLAND

OF PEOPLE IT FUNDED OF YORKSHIRE 
OTHER PLACES CUT BACK EVEN MORE UP 
TO EIGHTY PER CENT LESS FUNDING IN WANDSWORTH 
AND SANDWELL BARKING AND DAGENHAM 
AND HARTLEPOOL AND HARROW ARE THE 
BEST PERFORMERS THERE ARE SIMILAR 
CONCERNS FOR THE REST OF THE U. K. 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS STILL TOO 
EARLY TO SEE PROGRESS 
THESE ARE 
VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT 
PEOPLE MAKE AT A LOCAL LEVEL THEY 
ARE HIGHLY EMOTIVE DECISIONS OFTEN 
WHEN FAMILIES ARE IN A CRISIS WE 
ARE BEGINNING TO BED THAT GUIDANCE 
IN AND WE WILL REVIEW IT IN THE 
AUTUMN 
IT REMAINS A COMPLICATED AUTUMN AND CONFUSING PICTURE AND AGE 
CONCERN FEARS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE ARE STILL LOSING OUT 
IN A FEW MOMENTS WE WILL ASK THE

TIME TIME MADELEINE MCCANN'S PARENTS HAVE 
CONDEMNED THE LEAK OF REMARKS THEY 
MADE IN INTERVIEWS CARRIED OUT BY 
POUR TUEGAES POLICE THE 
TRANSCRIPTS SHOW THAT ON THE 
MORNING BEFORE MADELEINE 
DISAPPEARED SHE ASKED WHY HER 
MOTHER HADN'T COME WHEN THE 
CHILDREN WERE CRYING THE NIGHT 
BEFORE THE MCCANN SPOKESMAN'S SAID 
THE LEAK WAS A DELIBERATE SMEAR 
YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHY 
DOCUMENTATION WHICH WAS IN THE 
POLICE FILES COVERED BY PORTUGESE 
JUDICIAL SECRECY IS IN THE PUBLIC 
DOMAIN IT IS NOT ONLY ILLEGAL IT 
IS OUTRAGEOUS 
A CONTROVERSIAL 
METHOD OF GATHERING EVIDENCE USING 
TINY FRAGMENTS OF D. N. A. HAS BEEN 
GIVEN THE ALL CLEAR BY GOVERNMENT 
SCIENTISTS TOUCH D. N. A. WHICH CAN 
IDENTIFY A PERSON AFTER TWO OR 
THREE CELLS HAD BEEN SUSPENDED

BOMBING USED LOW COPY OR SO CALLED 
TOUCH D. N. A. TO HELP TO BRING CHARGES 
OF MURDER THAT CASE COLLAPSED AND 
CONCERNS OVER EVIDENCE IN THE 
RACHEL NICKELL MURDER CASE HAD 
ALREADY TRIGGERED A RE EXAMINATION 
OF THE VALIDITY OF THIS 
CONTROVERSIAL SECRETARY NEEK THE 
STANDARD D. N. A. ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE 
CAN GAIN A MATCH FROM AROUND SIXTY 
HUMAN CELLS LOW COPY WORKS DOWN 
TO ONE OR TWO CELLS WHICH COULD BE 
LEFT BEHIND AFTER THE BRIEFEST

TECHNIQUE SUPPORTS ITS USE HOWEVER 
THERE ARE STILL CONCERNS DESPITE 
SEVERAL YEARS' USE THERE IS STILL 
NO RELIABLE MEASURE OF THE SUCCESS 
RATE WITH AT LEAST ONE POLICE 
FORCE ESTIMATING NINETY FOUR PER CENT OF TOUCH D. N. A. 
TESTS DON'T GIVE A FULL PROFILE 
AND THERE ARE DOUBTS OVER THE 
QUALITY OF POLICE LABORATORIES AND 
THEIR ROLE IN FORENSIC SCIENCE WORK 
PEOPLE WHO DO THE WORK MUST BE 
TRAINED PROPERLY AND MUST BE GIVEN 
MATERIALS THAT ARE D. N. A. FREE TO 
COLLECT THE SAMPLES THAT IS 
ALREADY IN PLACE FOR MANY FORCES 
BUT THE STANDARD NEEDS TO BE RAISED 
A LITTLE BIT MORE AND THE STANDARDS 
NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE AND WRITTEN 
DOWN DOWN THE DEBATE ABOUT TOUCH D. N. A. EVIDENCE 
WON'T END WITH TODAY'S REVIEW OF 
THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT THERE IS A 
CALL FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT

HALF AN HOUR 
THE MAIN STORIES THE CHARITY AGE 
CONCERN SAYS THOUSANDS OF OLDER 
PEOPLE ARE BEING FORCED TO PAY FOR 
NURSING CARE THAT SHOULD BE FREE ON 
THE N. H. S. 
A COUNCIL HAS ADMITTED SMILE ON 
THEIR FAMILY TO FIND OUT IF THEY 
WERE REALLY LIVING IN A SCHOOL 
CATCHMENT AREA 
COMING UP DO MORE WORDS MAKE LESS 
SENSE FOR EXAMPLE 
YES RIGHT 
SHE'S WELL BING BING IT'S BLING 
BLING 
APPARENTLY A TENTH OF OUR BLING WORK JUST FILL IN TIME THEN IT'S TIME NOW FOR THE WEATHER 
THE FORECAST FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS 
IS ONE OF SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS 
SOME OF THE SHOWERS WILL BE HEAVY 
SOME WILL HAVE HAIL AND THUNDER AND 
LIGHTNING ON LOWER LEVELS WE MAY 
SEE SLEET THE SNOW WILL BE LARGELY 
ON HIGHER GROUND ON THE RADAR 
PICTURE YOU COULD SEE HOW WET IT 
HAS BEEN OVERNIGHT CURRENTLY WE 
HAVE RAIN IN THE NORTH EAST OF 
SCOTLAND AND PUSHING UP INTO WALES 
AND NORTHERN IRELAND PATCHY RAIN 
IN THE SOUTH EAST WILL BE REPLACED 
WITH SHOWERS LATER IRAN AND 
SUNSHINE AS HE PUSHED UP INTO THE 
NORTH EAST WE'RE LOOKING AT 
SHOWERY OUTBREAKS AND RAIN ON 
HIGHER GROUND SNOW SOME SLEET BY 
NINE A M. THE RAIN WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH 
UP INTO THE NORTH EAST OF SCOTLAND 
INTO WALES MORE SHOWERS SHOWERS 
OR SO ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND IN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF 
ENGLAND AND WALES IT WILL BE MORE 
BREEZY GUSTY WINDS AROUND CORNWALL 
THAT WILL TAKE THE EDGE OFF 
TEMPERATURES SOME OF THE SHOWERS 
WILL BE HEAVY THUNDERY WITH HAIL 
AND SLEET IN ANY SUNSHINE 
TEMPERATURES RESPONDING TO THIRTEEN 
CELSIUS OVERNIGHT SOME OF THE 
SHOWERS WILL DIE AWAY TOMORROW 
SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS AGAIN SOME OF 
THEM SLOW MOVING BUT IT CLEAR 
ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND SUNDAY 
THE RAIN BAND ON THE NEAR CONTINENT 
LOOKED LIKE IT WILL THREATEN THE 
MARATHON ON SUNDAY IT IS LESS 
THREATENING NOW AND FOR MANY ON 
SUNDAY A DAY OF SUNSHINE AND 
SHOWERS UP TO ELEVEN CELSIUS 
NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR 
MEDICAL CARE WHICH THEY MIGHT NEED 
AS THEY GET OLDER EVEN IF THEY 
RECEIVE THAT CARE IN A HOME THE 
RESEARCH BY AGE CONCERN SUGGESTS 
MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING FORCED TO 
FUND THEIR LONG TERM CARE DID SO 
DESPITE GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES 
DAVID STOUT IS DIRECTOR OF THE 
PRIMARY CARE TRUST NETWORK THAT 
MORNING ON THE FACE OF IT A LOT 
OF PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THIS 
THOSE LEAST ABLE TO DEAL WITH THESE 
KINDS OF PROBLEMS AND FIND IN 
SUDDENLY THEIR HEALTHCARE IS NOT 
BEING PAID FOR 
I SHOULD EXPLAIN 
WHAT THE CURRENT CONTINUING 
HEALTHCARE RAISED IT IS A TERM 
USED TO DEFINE THESE SERVICES THE 
N. H. S. OFFERS THAT IT PAYS OFF FOR 
PEOPLE WITH ONGOING HEALTH NEEDS 
OUTSIDE OF HOSPITAL THAT MIGHT BE 
IN THEIR HOME IN A RESPITE 
INSTITUTION IN A CARE HOME 
ESSENTIALLY 
NURSING CARE YES YES NURSING CARE A RANGE OF OTHER 
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AS WELL AS AS DISTINCT FROM SOCIAL CARE WHICH IS 
SEPARATE NONE THE LESS THAT THERE 
ARE REAL PRIDE PROBLEMS HOW CAN 
THERE BE SUCH DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN 
PRIMARY CARE TRUSTS HISTORICALLY HISTORICALLY THERE HAVE BEEN VARIATIONS THE 
GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED LAST OCTOBER 
CONSISTENT GUIDELINES AND WILL AND 
IT HAD BEEN UP TO INDIVIDUAL AREAS 
TO DEFINE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN 
HEALTHCARE AND SOCIAL CARE AS AL 
RESULT WE HAD A DEGREE OF VARIATION 
LAST OCTOBER THERE WERE NEW 
GUIDELINES BROUGHT IN DESIGNED TO 
MAKE SURE THERE WAS A CONSISTENT 
AND FAIR AND EQUITABLE ACCESS 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY IF YOU HAD THE 
SAME LEADING ONE OCCASION YOU 
WOULD BE CONFIDENT TO GET THE SAME 
SERVICES AS A NEIGHBOURING LOCATION 
IS IT NOT WORKING 
WE HAVE TO BE 
CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE DATA THAT AGE 
CONCERN ARE USING FOR EXAMPLE THE 
PRIMARY CARE TRUSTS SHOWN AS HAVING 
THE LOWEST RANKS WE HAVE CHECKED 
THE VIGURS FIGURES AND THE 
ACTUAL FIGURES ARE SEVEN AND ONE HALF TIMES 
HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES QUOTED IN 
THIS REPORT 
IN OUR REPORT WE HAD 
A WOMAN WHO SOLD HER HOME AN 
ELDERLY LADY BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT 
SHE HAD TO PAY FOR THINGS SHE DID 
NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT IS THEN 
APPALLING SITUATION TO BE IN WE WE DON'T WANT THAT KIND SITUATION TO 
ARISE HENCE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT 
PATIENTS AND THEIR RELATIVES AT A 
VERY VULNERABLE TIME YOU CAN 
IMAGINE IT IS A VERY VULNERABLE 
TIME IT IS IMPORTANT PEOPLE 
UNDERSTAND AND A CLEAR ABOUT THEIR 
ENTITLEMENT THERE IS AN ASSESSMENT 
DONE BY A TEAM OF HEALTH 
PROFESSIONALS USUALLY A DOCTOR AND 
NURSE OR SOCIAL WORKER AND THE NEW 
GUIDANCE WHICH CAME IN IN OCTOBER 
CLEAR CRITERIA FOR THAT 
SEX CLEAR CRITERIA FOR THAT ASSESSMENT SETS THE BIG ISSUE 
FOR PATIENCE OF HIS HEALTHCARE IS 
AT FREE AT THE POINT OF DELIVERY 
WHEREAS SOCIAL CARE MAY REQUIRE 
FUNDING FROM THE INDIVIDUAL IT IS 
IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE DO NOT 
MISUNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM AND IT IS 
FAIR AND CONSISTENT ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY COUNTRY HE HAS SEEN THE NUMBERS ON THE 
SCREEN YOU CAN SEND YOUR THOUGHTS 
TO WORSE WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR 
YOUR PERSONAL STORIES ABOUT THAT 
GET IN TOUCH WITH US 
THIS WEEK WE HAVE HEARD WARNINGS 
SOARING GLOBAL FOOD PRICES MIGHT 
NOT BE A TEMPORARY PHENOMENON TAKE 
RISE WHERE DEMAND IS OUTSTRIPPING

SEVENTY PER CENT NICK RAVENSCROFT HAS BEEN TO 
MANCHESTER'S BRAEMAR TO SEE HOW THE

THE U. K. IMPORTS FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND TONNES OF 
RICE EVERY YEAR BASMATI RICE IS 
THE MOST POPULAR TYPE IN THE 
KITCHEN OF THIS INDIAN RESTAURANT 
THEY GET THROUGH SACK LOADS OF IT 
SINCE LAST YEAR THE PRICE HAS MORE 
THAN DOUBLED IF THE COST OF PRICE 
GOES UP THEN IN THE U. K. AT LEAST 
IT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO MEAN YOU

TABLE RICE IS A MAJOR IF RICE IS 
A MAJOR PART OF YOUR BUSINESS IT 
WILL DENT PROFITS 
IT COSTS ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
EXTRA A WEEK ON RISE OVER THE YEAR 
SEVEN THOUSAND WHICH HAS A LOT OF MONEY 
BUT HE CAN'T JUST SERVE THE 
INCREASE TO HIS CUSTOMERS IT WOULD 
COST A SMALL FORTUNE TO REPRINT THE 
MANY WITH THE UPDATED PRICES SO HE 
HAS STUCK ABSORBING THE COST 
HIMSELF AND THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPLY 
THE RESTAURANTS ARE ALSO SEEING 
PROFITS SQUEEZED AS THE VALUE OF 
THE GRAIN ON THE WORLD MARKET GOES 
UP AND UP LAST YEAR FOR SIXTY YOU 
WOULD PROBABLY GET TO BAGS OF RICE 
THIS YEAR BUT THE PRICE INCREASES 
JUST ONE 
PLACES LIKE INDIA EGYPT 
CHINA ARE RESTRICTING IT COMING 
INTO THE COUNTRY SO THEY CAN HOLD 
BACK ON THEIR OWN PRICES WHICH 
MEANS AVAILABILITY IS DECREASING 
THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SAYS MANY 
RESTAURANTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT 
RISING COSTS 
SOME FEAR THEY MAY 
HAVE TO LAY OFF STAFF 
HE CAN SEE MORE SPECIAL REPORTS ON 
THE IMPACT OF THE RISING COST OF 
RICE ALL DAY ON B. B. C. NEWS TWENTY FOUR

SOME OF THESE GUYS UNDER

MEASURES TO CHECK IF A FAMILY

CATCHMENT AREA 
LET'S LOOK AT THE SPORT NOW 
WE WILL HAVE NEWS OF A FANTASTIC 
NIGHT FOR RANGERS IN A SECOND BUT 
BECAUSE THE MASTERS FINISHED VERY 
LATE LAST NIGHT WE ARE GOING TO 
START WITH THAT IN PERFECT 
CONDITIONS FOR JUSTIN ROSE IT WAS 
HE WHO FLOURISHED HE FINISHED FOUR 
UNDER TO SHARE THE LEAD WITH TREVOR 
IMMELMAN HE RECOVERED FROM A POOR 
START WHEN HE DROPPED TWO SHOTS HE 
THEN PUT FOUR BIRDIES TOGETHER IN A 
ROW HE HAS BEEN IN THIS POSITION 
BEFORE HE HAS LED THE MASTERS 
AFTER THE FIRST ROUND ON THREE 
OCCASIONS BUT HE IS STILL NOT 
CONFIDENT OF WINNING THE TITLE 
WINNING MAJOR IS CAREER GOAL 
HOPEFULLY MORE THAN ONE BUT AT THE 
SAME TIME THERE ARE STEPPING STONES 
ALONG THE WAY DON'T NECESSARILY 
THINK THAT THE NEXT ACHIEVEMENT I 
HAVE TO TICK OFF IS A MAJOR BUT IT 
WOULD BE NICE IF I SKIPPED COUPLE 
OF STEING STONES AND WENT STRAIGHT 
TO THE BIG ONE 
STEPPING STONES 
LEE WESTWOOD 
ALSO SHAIRDZ THE LEAD AT ONE STAGE 
ON SPARKLING FORM SHARED THE 
LEAD BUT HE HAD TO SETTLE FOR 
THIRD ON THREE UNDER PAR WHAT OF 
TIGER HE DIDN'T HAVE THE BEST OF 
STARTS BUT THANKS TO AN EAGLE AT 
THE FIFTEENTH HE FIN FINISHED LEVEL PAR 
FOUR SHOTS OFF THE PLACE L. THINK 
IT IS FAIR TO SAY HE IS STILL WELL 
PLACED AN AMAZING DAY FOR THE 
YUERNINGS IN GENERAL PAUL CASEY 
AND SANDY LYLE IN ONE UNDER BUT 
SHOT OF THE DAY CAME FROM IAN 
POULTER TWO SHOTS OFF THE LEAD 
THAT SHOT JUST THE NINETEENTH HOLE IN ONE

POSITION THEY TOOK THE LEAD ON THE

BEFORE I GO A COUPLE OF THE PAPERS 
LIVERPOOL IS DOMINATING THE BACK 
OF THE MIRROR THIS SUMS IT UP 
NICELY RICK PARRY AND TOM HICKS 
THE PAPERS DEMONSTRATING THE 
BREAKDOWN IN BOARDROOM RELATIONS 
IT WOULD SEEM AT LIVERPOOL IT IS 
EXTRAORDINARY FOR A CO OWNER TO ASK 
A CHIEF EXECUTIVE TO STAND DOWN 
APPARENTLY IT STEMS FROM AN 
INTERVIEW WHERE RICK PARRY GAVE THE 
B. B. C. AND ASKED PLEADED PUBLICLY 
WITH BOTH SIDES GILLETTE AND HICKS 
TO COME TO THE TO SORT OUT THEIR 
DIFFERENCES AND MOVE THE CLUB

ANFIELD PLUNGED INTO CIVIL WAR AND 
JUSTIN ROSE A FANTASTIC DAY FOR 
THE EUROPEAN GOLFERS LEE WESTWOOD 
FINISHED AT ONE FIFTEEN A M. OUR TIME IN 
NEAR DARKNESS HE WANTED TO FINISH 
HIS ROUND SO HE DIDN'T HAVE TO 
PLAY EARLY THIS MORNING DO THEY 
GET EXTRA MONEY FOR THE HOLE IN ONE 
THING L. DON'T THINK SO JUST THE 
GLORY OF KNOWING YOU HAVE GOT A 
HOLE IN ONE THEY GET A CRYSTAL 
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO DROP THAT 
WOULD YOU 
WE HAVE BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE 
TALES OF DESPERATE MEASURES THAT 
PARENTS WILL TAKE TO GET THEIR 
CHILDREN INTO THE BEST SCHOOLS BUT 
NOW IT SEEMS ONE LOCAL COUNCIL HAS 
GONE TO EXTREME LENGTHS TO TRY TO 
CATCH POTENTIAL FRAUDSTERS AT IT 
POOLE COUNCIL IN DORSET HAS 
ADMITTED TO SPYING ON ONE FAMILY IT 
BELIEVED MIGHT BE TRYING TO BEND 
THE RULES AND USED SPECIAL LAWS 
MEANT TO CATCH TERRORISTS AS 
JUSTIFICATION ALEX GASK IS LEGAL 
OFFICER FOR THE HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP 
LIBERTY GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU 
MAKE OF THIS STORY 
WELL IT IS 
QUITE CLEARLY AN ABSOLUTELYRY 
DICKOUS USE OF THESE FOURS 
RIDICULOUS USE OF THESE POWERS 
IN EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS FOR 
GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO 
DEAL WITH THESE POWERS FOR EXAMPLE 
WHEN DEALING WITH SERIOUS CRIME OR 
TERRORISM BUT IN A SITUATION LIKE 
THIS TO SPY FOR TWO AND A HALF 
WEEKS ON A FAMILY SIMPLY TO CHECK 
WHETHER THEY LIVE IN A PARTICULAR 
CATCHMENT AREA IS VERY SIMPLY JUST 
DISPROPORTIONATE 
BUT THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATE ENTITLED TO DO THAT THEY ARE DONE 
NOTHING WRONG MUCH THEY ARE FREE TO 
USE THOSE POWERS 
IT IS AN 
INTERESTING QUESTION THE 
LEGISLATION ALLOWS LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES PERHAPS SURPRISINGLY 
TO USE DIRECTED SURVEILLANCE BUT 
ONLY WHEN IT IS BOTH NECESSARY AND 
PROPORTIONATE TO THE AIM THAT THEY 
ARE SEEKING TO ACHIEVE I'M AFRAID 
I THINK IT IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT IT 
IS NOT PROPORTIONATE TO STAKE OUT A 
FAMILY HOME FOR TWO AND A HALF 
WEEKS MERELY TO CHECK ON WILL THEY 
LIVE WITHIN A CATCHMENT AREA YOU YOU ARE SAYING THE COUNCIL SHOULD BE 
FREE TO USE THOSE IN THEIR 
DISCRETION BUT IN THIS CASE THEY 
HAVE GONE OVER THE TOP AND IT COULD 
HAVE BEEN DONE DIFFERENTLY 
I THINK 
IT CERTAINLY COULD HAVE BEEN DONE 
DIFFERENTLY IN THIS SITUATION 
THESE ARE INTRUSIVE AND SERIOUS 
POWERS YES THEY MAY BE ACCEPTABLE 
WHEN WE ARE DEALING WITH SERIOUS 
CRIME WITH TERRORISM BUT NOT IN 
THIS KIND OF SITUATION L. THINK IT 
IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNING THAT THE 
LEGISLATION DOES ALLOW SO MANY 
DIFFERENT PUBLIC AUTHORITIES L. 
THINK IT IS OVER SIX HUNDRED ARE ALLOWED TO 
USE THESE POWERS THEY SHOULD BE 
FAR NOR INFREQUENTLY USED AND THE 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES NEED TO RECOGNISE 
ONLY WHEN IT IS NECESSARY AND 
PROPORTIONATE 
IS ONE OF THE PROPORTIONATE PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE KNOW THEY HAVE 
USED IT IF PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW 
WOULD IT MATTER THE LADY SAYS HER 
FAMILY HAS BEEN IS UP UPSET NOW 
HER DAUGHTER HAS THE IMPRESSION 
THEY ARE BEING FOLLOWED ALL THE 
TIME BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THEY KNOW 
MOST SITUATIONS IN WHICH COVERT 
DIRECTED SURVEILLANCE IS USED THE 
INDIVIDUAL WILL NOT KNOW BUT I 
DON'T THINK THAT ALONE MEANS YOU 
CAN POSSIBLY JUSTIFY THE INTRUSIVE 
NATURE AND THE INTERFERENCE WITH 
THE PERSONAL LIBERTY OF THAT 
INDIVIDUAL THAT ARISES SIMPLY 
BECAUSE THEY FIND OUT ABOUT IT 
AFTERWARDS THAT DOESN'T REMEDY 
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM DURING THE 
COURSE OF THAT INVESTIGATION THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME 
FOR YEARS SCIENTISTS AND DETECTIVES 
HAVE KNOWN THAT SOMEONE'S D. N. A. CAN 
BE ISOLATED FROM A SMALL AMOUNT OF 
LIKE SALIVA OR HAIR BUT 
THERE IS A MORE CONTROVERSIAL 
METHOD WHICH EXPERTS SAY ALLOWS 
THEM TO IDENTIFY SOMEONE WHO HAS 
MERELY TOUCHED AN OBJECT 
THE TECHNIQUE IS CALLED TOUCH D. N. A. 
OR LOW COPY D. N. A. A PANEL OF 
GOVERNMENT SCIENTIST HAS GIVEN IT 
THE ALL CLEAR TO BE USED IN BRITISH 
COURTS LET'S SPEAK TO PROFESSOR 
ALAN JAMESON THE FORENSIC EXERT 
EXPLAIN TO US WHAT TOUCH D. N. A. IS 
WELL IT IS A MISNOMER REALLY THE 
TOUCH D. N. A. WE CAN ACTUALLY FIND WITH 
THE STANDARDS TECHNIQUE THIS 
TECHNIQUE PUSHES THE TECHNOLOGY 
BEYOND THE STANDARD DOWN TO PICO 
GRAMS WHICH IS ABOUT ONE MILLIONTH 
OF A GRAIN OF SALT IT IS VERY LOW 
IF I HAVE TOUCHED THIS PEN THE 
THEORY IS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO 
FIND MY D. N. A. ON IT 
THAT'S THE 
THEORY 
DOES IT WORK 
SOMETIMES L. THEORY THINK THE REVIEW COMES TO THE 
CONCLUSION THAT WE CAN AMPLIFY LOW 
AMOUNTS OF D. N. A. AND THEN GOES ON TO 
TALK ABOUT FITNESS FOR PURPOSE NO 
ONE HAS EVER BEEN IN ANY DOUBT THAT 
WE CAN AMPLIFY VERY VERY SMALL 
AMOUNTS OF D. N. A. THE REAL ISSUE IS 
DO WE KNOW WHAT IT MEANS WHEN WE 
SEE A PROFILE AND PARTICULARLY A 
MIXED PROFILE FROM A CRIME SCENE 
O. K. GIVE US AN EXAMPLE 
WELL FOR 
EXAMPLE WHEN YOU MIX TWO PEOPLE'S 
D. N. A. TOGETHER IT IS LIKE MIXING THE 
COINS IN THEIR POCKET TO THE SO 
THAT THEY END UP ON THE TABLE AND 
YOU COME INTO THE ROOM AND NOW YOU 
HAVE TO SAY WHICH COINS CAME FROM 
WHICH PERSON YOU SIMPLY CAN'T DO 
THAT AND THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS 
OF INTERPRETING MIXURES NOT ONLY 
IN THIS LOW COPY TECHNIQUE BUT IN 
THE STANDARD TECHNIQUE AND THERE 
ARE MORE COMPLICATIONS WITH THE LOW 
COPY TECHNIQUE BECAUSE SOMETIMES 
PEAKS APPEAR FROM SOMEWHERE AND 
SOMETIMES THEY DISAPPEAR 
SO IF 
THIS WAS BEING USED IN THE CRIMINAL 
JUSTICE SYSTEM IS IT A GOOD IDEA 
OR NOT 
WELL I AGREE TO SOME EXTENT 
TO THE C. P. S. WHO SAY IT IS A CASE BY 
CASE BASIS SOME PROFILES ARE QUITE 
CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS BUT IN THE 
AREA THAT LOW COPY NUMBER WORKS IT 
IS AN AREA WHERE THE SAMPLING 
PROCESS CAUSES SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS 
AND I AMONG OTHERS AM CERTAINLY 
NOT CONVINCED THAT WE KNOW HOW TO 
IDENTIFY THOSE PROBLEMS AND TAKE 
ACCOUNT OF THEM 
THANK YOU 
PROFESSOR PROFESSOR THE TIME NOW IS SIX HUNDRED FORTY FIVE EXACTLY YOU 
ARE WATCHING BREAKFAST 
THE MAIN STORIES STORIES THE CHARITY AGE CONCERN SAYS 
THOUSANDS OF OLDER PEOPLE ARE BEING 
FORCED TO PAY FOR NURSING CARE THAT 
SHOULD BE FREE ON THE N. H. S. 
A COUNCIL HAS ADMITTED SPYING ON A 
FAMILY TO FIND OUT IF THEY WERE 
REALLY LIVING IN A SCHOOL CATCHMENT 
AREA AREA ALSO COMING UP IN THE PROGRAMME 
THE HYMN THAT'S OUT OF TUNE WITH 
ONE CATHEDRAL DOES JERUSALEM 
REALLY DESERVE TO BE BANNED FROM 
CHURCH 
GLOBAL PLAYER LOTS OF IT HERE 
BECAUSE I LOVE IT WE ARE GOING TO 
PLAY LOTS OF IT 
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY THE 
FORECAST IS OF SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS 
SOME SHOWERS WILL BE HEAVY WITH 
HAIL AND THUNDER AND EVEN SOME 
SLEET AS WELL IT'S NO LARGELY TO 
HIGHER GROUND ON THE RADAR PICTURE 
GOING BACK TWELVE HOURS WE HAVE A BAND 
OF RAIN ACROSS THE NORTH EAST OF 
SCOTLAND AND ANOTHER A CRUSH THE 
IRISH SEA THE RAIN ANOTHER 
ACROSS THE IRISH SEA TOWARDS THE 
MIDLANDS WE ARE BACK INTO HEAVY 
SHOWERS SNOW TO HIGHER GROUND 
ACROSS THE NORTH EAST BY NINE A M. WE 
WILL STILL HAVE RAIN A NEW BAND 
ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE 
SOUTH WEST OF SCOTLAND FOR WALES 
QUITE A BIT OF CLOUD AND SOME 
SHOWERS SHELLS ALSO ACROSS THE 
SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND WE WILL SEE 
BREEZIER CONDITIONS ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN HALF OF THE BRITISH ISLES 
QUITE GUSTY AROUND CORNWALL WHICH 
WILL TAKE THE EDGE OF THE 
TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE DAY 
INTERSPERSED BETWEEN SHOWERS 
BRIGHT SPELLS TEMPERATURES 
REACHING THIRTEEN CELSIUS TEMPERED BY 
THE BREEZY CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTH 
THIS EVENING MANY SHOWERS WILL DIE 
AWAY WE HAVE A NEW FEATURE IN TO 
THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND WALES 
AND THE MIDLANDS IT WILL BE WINDY 
WITH IT TOMORROW A DAY OF 
SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS OF SHOWERS 
SLOW MOVING ESPECIALLY ACROSS 
NORTHERN IRELAND ON SUNDAY WE 
THOUGHT THE BAND OF RAIN ACROSS THE 
CONTINENT MIGHT COME IN TOWARDS 
LONDON IT WOULD BE WET FOR THE 
MARATHON BUT THAT THIS LOOKS LESS 
NOW SUNDAY A DAY OF SUNSHINE AND 
SHOWERS SNOW ON THE HILLS THE 
RISK OF SOME HAIL AND THUNDER 
THANK YOU YOU JUST INTERRUPTED US 
TALKING ABOUT ECONOMICS TOGETHER 
LUCKILY AARON IS HERE TO EXPLAIN 
THE INTEREST RATE CUTS 
AS ITALY YESTERDAY THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND CUT THE INTEREST RATE BY A 
QUARTER OF A PERCENT AND IT NOW 
STANDS AT FIVE PER CENT IN AN ATTEMPT TO 
STIMULATE THE ECONOMY BOOST 
CONFIDENCE HOW HAVE THE HIGH 
STREET LENDERS REACTED OF THE FIFTY EIGHT 
LENDERS THE B. B. C. SPOKE TO TEN HAVE 
CONFIRMED THEY WILL PASS ON THE 
FULL RATE CUT TO THEIR STANDARD 
FARE WILL RATE CUSTOMERS NONE HAS 
SAID THEY WILL NOT BE PASSING ON 
THE RATE CUT SO THAT IS POSSIBLY 
GOOD NEWS STANDARD VARIABLE 
CUSTOMERS ARE IN THE MINORITY THE 
ONLY TWENTY PER CENT OF THOSE TYPES OF 
MORTGAGES AT THERE MOST CUSTOMERS 
ARE MADE TRACKER RATE OR FIXED RATE 
HOW HAVE THEY FED TO LENDERS 
NATIONWIDE AND ALLIANCE AND 
LEICESTER HAVE CONFIRMED THEY ARE 
RAISING THEIR FIXED RATE DEALS IT 
HAS TO BE SAID INTEREST RATES 
AREN'T JUST ABOUT MORTGAGES ARE 
ALSO SAVING TYPICALLY A RATE CUT 
ISN'T GOOD NEWS FOR SAVERS 
WHATSOEVER BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN A 
CHANGE IN SAVING RATES AT THE 
MOMENT BECAUSE THE BANKS THEY HAVE 
A SHORTAGE OF CASH SO THE BANKS 
WANT TO ENTICE PEOPLE TO SAVE MONEY 
AND THEY NEED THAT CASH L. AM THE 
FIRST ONE I HAVE TO SAY ALL OF 
THIS CAN BE CONFUSING LET US GET 
SOME HELP ON THIS CLARE FRANCIS IS 
EDITOR OF MONEYSUPERMARKET WELCOME 
TO THE PROGRAMME WE HAVE BEEN 
KEEPING AN EYE ON HER FEET LENDERS 
HAVE BEEN REACTING IN TOUGH TIMES 
I IMAGINE X. BOX AREN'T WATCHING NOT 
SO MUCH THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
INTEREST RATE BUT WHAT THE BANDS 
BANKS LEND THAT I IMAGINE 
EXPERTS 
THE LIBOR RATE 
THE AMOUNT EXPERTS THE BANKS HAVE TO RAISE TWO FUND 
MORTGAGES AT THE MOMENT BANKS ARE 
HAVING TO PAY MORE FOR THEIR MONEY 
THAN USUAL SO THERE IS A DECOUPLING 
AND THE LIBOR RATE IS A QUARTER OF 
A PERCENTAGE POINT HIGHER THAN THE 
BANK LENDING RATE 
THAT IS WHY WE 
ARE SEEING THIS MAKES BAG NEXT 
BACK MIXED BAG IF THE LIBOR 
RATE REMAINS AT A RELATIVELY HIGH 
LEVEL CAN WE SAY THAT THE ACTIONS 
BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND THE RATE 
CUT ISN'T DOING THE JOB TO 
STIMULATE AND BOOST THE ECONOMY IT IT IS A PROBLEM FOR THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND IT HAS THIS ISSUE OF 
BRINGING INTEREST RATES DOWN AND IT 
IS HAVING NO EFFECT ON THE COST OF 
BORROWING THE INSTITUTIONS ARE 
FACING THE BANK OF ENGLAND WILL BE 
THINKING HARD WHAT STEPS IT NEEDS 
TO TAKE TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION 
IF YESTERDAY'S RATE CUT DOESN'T 
HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE INTER BANK 
LENDING RATE 
THAT'S IT FOR NOW MORE LATER 
DO YOU SAY IT IS TO LOOM OR ARE 
YOU CALL IN COUPE OR WOULD YOU 
LOOK PERFECT IN A PEOPLE MOVER ONE 
CAR MANUFACTURE THIS WE SHOULD PAY 
MORE ATTENTION TO OUR CAR AND HAD 
SET UP A CAR CHANGING ROOM SO WE 
CAN TRY THEM ON FOR SIZE IT IS 
TRUE RICHARD WESTCOTT IS MEASURING 
UP SOME MOTORS FOR US IN NOTTINGHAM 
IT IS TRUE CAN YOU SIT YOUR CAR 
THAT IS THE QUESTION WE ARE ASKING 
CHEVROLET HAVE BUILT THIS CHANGING 
ROOM WE WILL BE TALKING TO CLASSIC 
CAR OWNERS FIRST I WENT TO CHECK 
OUT THIS CHANGING ROOM 
THESE HONEST HOW DO I LOOK IN MY 
CAR BE HONEST THANKS A LOT IT 
HAS BEEN A RELIABLE RUN AROUND 
MOST OF US HAVE NO IDEA HOW WE LOOK 
WHILE WE ARE DRIVING SO THEY KEEP 
CHANGING ROOM HAS BEEN BUILT FOR 
CUSTOMERS 
HOW CAN I HELP YOU B. A. CUSTOMERS B. A. ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING IN SILVER 
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT 
I THINK IT 
MAKES ME LOOK CHUNKY 
WHAT YOU 
THINK OF THAT 
THE IT TAKES POUNDS 
OF MAY DO I LOOK YOUNGER 
YES IT 
TAKES FIVE YEARS OF FEAR I'LL 
DRIVE IT'S STRAIGHT OUT OF THE 
SHOWER ROOM THANK YOU 
IT IS ALL 
GOOD FUN BUT IS IT USEFUL OR JUST A 
SALES GIMMICK 
WHEN WAS THE LAST 
TIME YOU BOUGHT A NEW SUIT OR 
PARISHES WITHOUT TRYING IT ON IT 
IS AN IMMEASURABLE WHY DO WE 
EXPECT CUSTOMERS TO DO THE SAME 
WITH A CAR 
YOU DON'T WEAR A CAR 
YOU DO WEAR A SUIT THAT'S RIGHT 
BUT YOU ARE WEARING A CAR AS WELL 
IT DOES BETRAY YOU AND YOUR 
PERSONALITY SEE ME TO KNOW HOW YOU 
LOOK IN IT 
O. K. SO WHAT DOES A 
PROFESSIONAL IMAGE GURU MAKE OF IT 
HE WE ARE SITTING IN THE CAR A 
MARKS THE NAPPIES AND BABY WIPES 
IT IS A SAFER OPTION THAN LOOKING 
AT HERSELF IN A WINDOW OF 
REFLECTION LOOKING AT YOURSELF 
YOU CHOOSE YOUR CAR MORE FOR 
PSYCHOLOGICAL THAN PHYSICAL REASONS 
THERE IS A SIZE AND BUDGET ISSUE 
I CAN'T SAY YOU WOULD CHOOSE A CAR 
TO IT YOU BECAUSE YOU DON'T 
HAVE TO WEAR IT YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO HAVE CAR WHICH IT DOESN'T FIT TO 
PROPERTY IT'S A PERSONALITY CHOICE 
DOES IT MATTER WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE

GOOD MORNING IT'S FRIDAY APRIL 
ELEVENTH ALSO AHEAD BIG BROTHER THE 
COUNCIL THAT SPIED ON A FAMILY TO

GOVERNMENT SCIENTISTS 
SOME OF THESE ANIMALS ARE SO BIG 
THEY GRAB HOLD OF YOUR LEG WITH 
THEIR MOUTH YOU THINK THEY ARE 
GOING TO PULL YOU DOWN 
A DIP ON 
THE COLD SIDE WE WILL MEET THE MAN 
WHO WENT SWIMMING WITH WHALES IN 
SUB ZERO WATERS 
NOW CAN YOU SUIT YOUR CAR CAN IT 
BE TOO BIG TOO SMALL THE WRONG

THE BIG BANNED SOUND IN CHURCH IS 
JERUSALEM NO LONGER WORTHY OF BEING 
SUNG AS A HYMN 
MORNING FIRST OUR MAIN STORY 
THOUSANDS OF ELDERLY PEOPLE IN 
ENGLAND ARE BEING FORCED TO PAY FOR 
LONG TERM CARE THAT THEY SHOULD BE 
GETTING FOR FREE THAT'S ACCORDING 
TO THE CHARITY AGE CONCERN THEY 
HAVE TOLD BREAKFAST THAT OLDER 
PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS 
ARE BEING ROUTINELY FAILED BY THE 
N. H. S. DESPITE NEW GOVERNMENT 
GUIDELINES THE LATEST FIGURES SHOW 
A DROP IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
GETTING THE FUNDING THEY ARE 
ENTITLED TO 
THIS IS A PHOTO OF MY MOTHER L. 
GUESS TAKEN IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES MEMORIES 
OF YOUTH BUT IN OLD AGE 
ELIZABETH'S MOTHER SUFFERED FROM 
DEMENTIA SHE NEEDED FOUR YEARS' 
CARE IN A NURSING HOME CARE

FOUND OUT THE N. H. S. SHOULD HAVE 
PICKED UP THE BILL 
I HAD TO SELL 
HER BUNGALOW THE PLACE THAT SHE 
LOVED I HAD TO SELL IT TO GENERATE 
ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY THE FEES AND 
YOU THINK WHY SHOULD I DO THIS 
WHEN FOR ANY OTHER ILLNESS YOU 
WOULDN'T BE FORCED TO DO THIS 
AFTER LONG BATTLE SHE FINALLY 
WON COMPENSATION 
CARE ADVICE CENTRES LIKE THIS ONE 
OFFER HELP TO PEOPLE AROUND THE 
COUNTRY ADVISERS HERE SAY MANY 
CALLS ARE FROM PEOPLE CONFUSED 
ABOUT HOW THEY WILL BE CARED FOR 
AND WHO WILL PAY FOR IT GOOD GOOD MORNING COUNSEL AND CARE THE THE SITUATION WAS SUPPOSED TO GET 
EASIER IN OCTOBER LAST YEAR THE 
GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED NEW 
GUIDELINES TO END REGIONAL 
VARIATIONS IN THE WAY LONG TERM 
CARE FUNDING IS ALLOCATED BUT N. H. S. 
FIGURES ANALYSED BY AGE CONCERN 
AND GIVEN TO THE B. B. C. SUGGEST THE 
POSTCODE LOTTERY HAS GOT WORSE 
WE ARE STILL SEEING MANY PRIMARY 
CARE TRUSTS WITHIN THE N. H. S. 
OFFERING OUTRAGEOUSLY LOW LEVELS OF 
SUPPORT TO PEOPLE WITH REALLY QUITE 
DESPERATE NEEDS AND DISPARITY FROM 
ONE TRUST TO ANOTHER SOMETIMES 
NEIGHBOURING TRUSTS IS ABSOLUTELY 
ENORMOUS

OTHER PLACES CUT BACK EVEN MORE UP 
TO EIGHTY PER CENT LESS FUNDING IN MID EVIDENT 
SANDWELL AND WANDSWORTH PCTS BY 
COMPARISON BARKING AND DAGENHAM 
HARROW AND HARTLEPOOL ARE THE BEST 
PERFORMANCE MUCH THESE ARE THE 
STARK CONTRASTS IN ENGLAND AND 
THERE ARE IS IMLARS CONCERNS FOR 
THE REST OF THE U. K. BUT THE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS STILL TOO 
EARLY TO SEE PROGRESS 
THESE ARE 
VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT 
PEOPLE MAKE AT A LOCAL LEVEL THEY 
ARE HIGHLY EMOTIVE OFTEN WHEN 
FAMILIES ARE IN A CRISIS WE ARE 
BEDDING THE EVIDENCE IN AND WE WILL 
REVIEW IT IN THE AUTUMN 
THE N. H. S. 
ONLY FUNDS THE MOST SERIOUS CASES 
NEEDING ONGOING MEDICAL ATTENTION 
THOSE WHO DON'T QUALIFY OFTEN END 
UP PAYING THE FULL COST OF CARE IF 
THEY HAVE ASSETS MORE THAN THIRTY ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
IT REMAINS A COMPLICATED AND 
CONFUSING PICTURE AGE CONCERN 
FEARS THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE ARE STILL LOSING OUT 
IN A FEW MINUTES THE HEAD OF THE 
CHARITY COUNSEL AND CARE IS HERE 
TO OFFER SOME ADVICE FOR PEOPLE WHO 
MAY BE PAYING MORE THAN THEY THINK 
THEY SHOULD 
A COUNCIL HAS ADMITTED SPYING ON A 
FAMILY USING LAWS DESIGNED TRACK 
TERRORISTS AND CRIMINALS TO FIND 
OUT IF THEY WERE LIVING IN A SCHOOL 
CATCHMENT AREA POOLE BOROUGH 
COUNCIL SAYS IT WAS RIGHT TO TREAT 
THE CASE AS A CRIMINAL MATTER THE 
FAMILY THEY WERE WATCHING SAY IT 
WAS AN CREEPY INFRINGEMENT OF THEIR 
LIBERTY LIBERTY MANY OF TODAY'S PAPERS CONTAIN 
SHOCK AND OUTRAGE THAT POWERS TO 
TACKLE TERRORISM WERE USED TO SPY 
ON A FAMILY OVER SCHOOL PLACES 
POOLE COUNCIL ADMITS IT WATCHED A 
FAMILY AT HOME AND IN THEIR DAILY 
MOVEMENTS TO FIND OUT IF THEY LIVED 
IN A CATCHMENT AREA FOR A SCHOOL 
WHICH THEIR THREE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER 
WANTED TO ATTEND THE MOTHER WHO 
HASN'T BEEN NAMED TOLD THE 
BOURNEMOUTH ECHO 
THE LEGISLATION USED BY THE COUNCIL 
THE REGULATION OF INVESTIGATERY 
POWERS ACT A NORMALLY USED TO 
MONITOR SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IT 
ALLOWING SURVEILLANCE AND THE 
INTERCEPTION OF COMMUNICATIONS IF 
COUNCILS SUSPECT CRIMINAL ACTS HAVE 
TAKEN PLACE 
IT IS PARTICULARLY 
CONCERNING THAT THE LEGISLATION 
DOES ALLOW SO MANY DIFFERENT PUBLIC 
AUTHORITIES I THINK IT IS OVER SIX HUNDRED 
ARE ALLOWED TO USE THESE POWERS I 
THINK THEY SHOULD BE FAR MORE 
INFREQUENTLY USED AND LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES NEED TO RECOGNISE ONLY 
WHEN IT IS NECK AND PROPORTIONATE 
THE FAMILY WERE CLEARED OF ANY 
WRONG DOING AND ONLY FOUND OUT 
THEY WERE INVESTIGATED WHEN TOLD BY 
THE PRIMARY SCHOOL POOLE COUNCIL 
SAYS IT IS THE THIRD TIME IT HAS 
CONDUCTED SURVEILLANCE LIKE THIS 
OVER SCHOOL PLACES 
MADELEINE MCCANN'S PARENTS HAVE 
CONDEMNED THE LEAK OF REMARKS THEY 
MADE IN INTERVIEWS CARRIED OUT BY 
FOR POR TUE GEESE POLICE THE 
TRANSCRIPTS SHOW ON THE MORNING 
BEFORE MADELEINE DISAPPEARED SHE 
ASKED WHY HER MOTHER HADN'T COME 
WHEN THE CHILDREN WERE CRYING THE 
NIGHT BEFORE THE MCCANS' SPOKESMAN 
SAID THE LEAK WAS A DELIBERATE 
SMEAR 
YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHY SMEAR DOCUMENTATION THAT WAS IN THE 
POLICE FILES COVERED BY PORTUGESE 
JUDICIAL SECRECY IS IN THE PUBLIC 
DOMAIN IT IS NOT ONLY ILLEGAL IT 
IS OUTRAGEOUS 
A CONTROVERSIAL METHOD OF GATHERING 
EVIDENCE BY TINYING FRAMENTS OF D. N. A. 
HAS BEEN GIVEN THE ALL CLEARY 
GOVERNMENT SCIENTIST TOUCH D. N. A. 
WHICH CAN IDENTIFY A PERSON BY JUST 
TWO OR THREE CELLS HAD BEEN 
SUSPENDED AFTER QUESTIONS WERE 
RAISED OVER ITS RELIABILITY THE THE INVESTIGATION OF THE OMAGH BOMBING 
USED LOW COPY OR SO CALLED TOUCH 
D. N. A. TO HELP TO BRING CHARGES OF 
MURDER BUT THAT CASE COLLAPSED AND 
THE CONCERNS OVER EVIDENCE IN THE 
RACHEL NICKELL MURDER CASE HAD 
ALREADY TRIGGERED A RE EXAMINATION 
THE VALIDITY OF THIS CONTROVERSIAL 
TECHNIQUE 
IT IS AN AREA WHERE THE TECHNIQUE SAMPLING PROCESS CAUSES SIGNIFICANT 
PROBLEMS AND I AMONG OTHERS ARE 
CERTAINLY NOT CONVINCED THAT WE 
KNOW HOW TO IDENTIFY THOSE PROBLEMS 
AND TAKE ACCOUNT OF THEM THE THE STANDARD D. N. A. ANALYSIS CAN GAIN A 
MATCH FROM AROUND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY HUMAN CELLS 
LOW COPY ALSO KNOWN AS LOW 
TEMPLATE OR TOUCH D. N. A. WORKS DOWN TO 
ONE OR TWO CELLS COULD BE LEFT 
BEHIND AFTER THE BRIEFEST CONTACT 
THE REVIEW OF THIS TECHNIQUES 
SUPPORTS ITS USE HOWEVER THERE ARE 
STILL CONCERNS DESPITE SEVERAL 
YEARS' USE THERE IS STILL NO 
RELIABLE MEASURE OF THE SUCCESS 
RATE WITH AT LEAST ONE POLICE 
FORCE ESTIMATING NINETY FOUR PER CENT OF TOUCH D. N. A. 
TESTS DON'T GIVE A FULL D. N. A. PROFILE 
THERE ARE ALSO DOUBTS OVER THE 
QUALITY OF POLICE LABORATORIES AND 
THEIR ROLE IN FORENSIC SCIENCE WORK 
PEOPLE THAT DO THE WORK MUST BE 
TRAINED PROPERLY AND MUST BE GIVEN 
MATERIALS THAT ARE D. N. A. FREE TO 
COLLECT THE SAMPLES NOW THAT IS 
ALREADY IN PLACE FOR MANY FORCES 
BUT THE STANDARD NEEDS TO BE RAISED 
A LITTLE BIT MORE AND THE STANDARDS 
NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE AND WRITTEN 
DOWN 
THE DEBATE ABOUT TOUCH D. N. A. DOWN EVIDENCE WON'T END WITH TODAY'S 
REVIEW OF THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT 
THERE IS CALL FOR FURTHER 
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW THE RESULTS 
THAT CAN BE GLEANED FROM THE 
TINIEST OF SAMPLES SHOULD BE 
INTERPRETED INTERPRETED UP TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS STRUGGLING 
TO PAY FUEL BILLS COULD BE HELPED 
UNDER A DEAL BETWEEN ENERGY 
COMPANIES AND THE GOVERNMENT SIX 
ENERGY FIRM HAVE AGREED TO INCREASE 
THEIR COLLECTIVE ANNUAL SPENDING ON 
SOCIAL PROGRAMMES BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE MILLION 
POUNDS OVER THREE YEARS SOME OF 
THE MONEY WILL HELP HOUSEHOLDS IN 
FUEL POVERTY THAT'S WHERE MORE 
THAN TEN PER CENT OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS 
USED TO HEAT THE HOME 
ALZHEIMER'S CHARITIES HAVE CALLED 
FOR FURTHER RESEARCH INTO AN 
AMERICAN TREATMENT WHICH APPEARS TO 
PRODUCE MARKED IMPROVEMENTS IN SOME 
PATIENTS CALIFORNIAN RESEARCHERS 
BELIEVE THEY HAVE FOUND A WAY OF 
IMPROVING BRAIN CELL COMMUNICATION 
BY INJECTING AN ANTI ARTHRITIC DRUG 
INTO THE NECK IN A SMALL SCALE 
TRIAL THEY HAVE DESCRIBED CHANGES 
TAKING PLACE IN PATIENTS WITHIN 
MINUTES BRITISH EXPERTS HAVE 
EXPRESSED CAUTIOUS OVER THE 
FINDINGS BUT SAY FURTHER RESEARCH 
IS MERIT

FLYING OFFICER WILLIAM WALES 
SLEEPING IN THE OFFICERS' MESS AND 
SHARING IN THE STRESSES AND STRAINS 
OF LEARNING TO FLY WITH HIS 
CLASSMATES THE SAME INSTRUCTOR SAT 
ALONGSIDE HIM DURING HIS EARLY 
FLIGHTS BUT WHEN HE FIRST WENT JOEL 
HE TOLD ME IT HAD BEEN A NERVE 
WRECKING EXPERIENCE 
I'M STILL HERE 
TO TELL THE TALE AND HAVEN'T BEEN 
BILLED FOR A PLANE IT WAS ONE OF 
THOSE EXPERIENCE WHERE I THOUGHT IT 
WOULD NEVER COME AROUND AND I 
THOUGHT THAT I WOULD GET UP 
PRACTICE NEXT THING I KNOW MY 
INSTRUCTOR JUMPED OUT AND WENT GO 
ON GET OVEN WITH IT L. WAS LIKE WHAT WHAT IT WASN'T SO BAD 
SINCE THEN THE 
PRINCE HAS BEEN FLYING BIGGER 
AIRCRAFT HIS R. A. F. EXPERIENCE PART 
OF THE PREPARATION FOR THE TIME 
WHEN AS KING HE WILL BE HEAD OF

ELEVEN POINT OH OH A ONCE THE PRINCE'S 
ATTACHMENT TOMT R. A. F. IS COMPLETE 
NEXT UP FOR HIM IS A STINT WITH THE 
ROYAL NAVY ATA TO THE R. A. F. 
YOU CAN SEE WILLIAM GET HIS WINGS 
LIVE ON B. B. C. NEWS TWENTY FOUR 
THOSE ARE THIS MORNING'S TOP 
STORIES COMING UP WE WILL MEET 
THE MAN WHO TOOK A SUB ZERO DIVE TO 
GO SWIMMING WITH WHALES 
NO ONE IN ENGLAND SHOULD HAVE TO 
PAY FOR MEDICAL CARE WHICH THEY 
MIGHT NEED AS THEY GET OLDER EVEN 
IF THEY RECEIVE THAT CARE IN A HOME 
BUT RESEARCH CARRIED OUT BY AGE 
CONCERN SUGGESTS MANY PEEL ARE 
BEING FORCED TO FUND THEIR LONG 
TERM CARE DESPITE NEW GOVERNMENT 
GUIDELINES INTENDED TO MAKE THE 
SYSTEM FAIRER STEPHEN BURKE IS 
HEAD OF THE OLDER PEEP'S CHARITY 
COUNCIL COUNSEL AND CARE IT SOUNDS 
WORRYING THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE 
PAYING FOR CARE THAT THEY SHOULD 
RECEIVE HOW OFTEN ARE YOU HEARING 
STORIES 
OLDER PEOPLE AND THEIR STORIES FAMILIES WILL BE WORRIED BY THIS 
RESEARCH AND A LOT OF PEOPLE CALL 
OUR ADVICE SERVICE BECAUSE THEY ARE 
IN THIS SITUATION THE GOVERNMENT 
INTRODUCED NEW GUIDANCE LAST 
OCTOBER WHICH TRIED TO MAKE THE 
WHOLE SITUATION MUCH FAIRER AND 
MUCH MORE CONSISTENT WHEREVER YOU 
LIVED IN THE COUNTRY WHAT THE 
RESEARCH SHOWS TODAY AND WHAT WE 
ARE STILL FINDING IS THAT IT DOES 
DEPEND ON WHERE YOU LIVE IT IS A 
WILL THERY OUT THERE AND THERE ARE 
BIG INCONSISTENCIES AT THE MOMENT 
IT IS A LOTTERY OUT THERE 
AND THERE ARE BIG INCONSISTENCIES 
AS TO WHO GETS HEALTH CARE FUNDING 
WHY ARE THERE INCONSISTENCIES IS 
IT BECAUSE SOME PRIMARY CARE TRUSTS 
ARE DIFFERENT RULES 
NO THE RULES 
SHOULD BE THE SAME WE HAVE A 
NATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING 
PEOPLE WE ARE STILL SEEING 
DIFFERENCES IN THE WAY THE 
FRAMEWORK IS BEING IMPLEMENTED AND 
WE ARE ALSO SEEING THE RESULTS OF 
SOME FINANCIAL PRESSURES BUT THE 
KEY THING FOR PEOPLE IS TO GET GOOD 
QUALITY ADVICE INDEPENDENT ADVICE 
OBVIOUSLY THEY CAN GET ADVICE FROM 
THEIR PRIMARY CARE TRUST FROM THE 
PATIENT ADVICE SERVICE BUT I WOULD 
ADVISE PEOPLE TO CONTACT AN 
INDEPENDENT SERVICE LIKE COUNSEL 
AND CARE SO THEY CAN FIND OUT WHAT 
THEIR RIGHTS AND ENTITLEMENTS ARE 
LET'S BE CLEAR IF WE CAN WHAT ARE 
YOUR RIGHTS YOU GET RIGHTS TO 
HEALTH CARE WHICH IS WHAT MEDICAL 
CARE THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD GET 
FOR FREE 
YES CONTINUING HEALTH 
CARE COVERS PEOPLE'S WHAELT NEEDS 
AND OBVIOUSLY OLDER PEOPLE WITH 
SEVERE NEEDS AND VERY DEPENDENT 
SHOULD BE GETTING CONTINUING HEALTH 
CARE BUT THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS IS 
COMPLEX AND CAN BE CONFUSING AND 
HAS A NUMBER OF STAGES WE WOULD 
RECOMMEND IF PEOPLE ARE UNHAPPY 
WITH THE THEIR ASSESSMENTS AND THE 
OUTCOME THEY SHOULD CHALLENGE 
THEIR RHYMERY CARE TRUST THEY 
SHOULD ASK TO SEE THEIR PRIMARY 
CARE TRUST AND ASK FOR A COPY OF 
THE ASSESSMENT AND ASK FOR IT TO BE 
REDONE 
IT IS VERY COMPLICATED WE REDONE ARE GETTING LOTS OF E. MAILS ASKING 
ABOUT DEMENTIA SAYING THAT 
ACTUALLY IT DOESN'T SEEM TO COVER 
DEMENTIA WHAT IS THE CASE THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT AGAIN WE HAVE QUITE A LOT OF 
CALLERS WHO HAVE DEMENTIA AND THINK 
THEY SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO 
CONTINUING HEALTH CARE MANY ARE 
MISSING OUT WE WOULD ARGUE THEY 
SHOULD BE COVERED AS WELL 
IT IS VERY COMPLICATED BUT PEOPLE 
ARE IN A DIFFICULT POSITION ALREADY 
TO BE ABLE TO CHALLENGE IT VERY VERY OFTEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FAMILIES 
IN CRISIS WHO NEED AS MUCH SUPPORT 
AS POSSIBLE WHICH IS WHY 
INDEPENDENCE HAVE POPPED SUPPORT 
AND ADVICE IS SO IMPORTANT HELPING 
THEM TO ACTUALLY CHALLENGED THE 
ASSESSMENT THROUGH A REVIEW PROCESS 
AND THERE ARE SEVERAL STAGES THERE 
SOME FAMILIES HAVE WON COMPENSATION 
AS A RESULT WE NEED TO SUPPORT 
FAMILIES AND OLDER PEOPLE 
WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS LATER 
IF YOU HAVE HAD SOMEONE IN YOUR 
FAMILY AFFECTED BY THIS DO LET US 
KNOW 
LET US TAKE A LOOK AT THE 
NEWSPAPERS THE FRONT PAGE HERE 
GOING ON THIS STORY THE NEW AGE OF 
THE TRAIN THEY SAY FOR THE LAST THIRTEEN 
YEARS ARE PASSENGER GROWTH ON THE 
PLATE TRAINS HAS BEEN GROWING 
EVERY YEAR AND WE ARE UP TO RECORD 
LEVELS OF RAIL USE IT COMES WITH 
WARNING IF MORE PEOPLE TURN TO THE 
CHAINS THEY NEED VASTLY MORE 
INVESTMENT THAN HIS COUNTRY 
HAPPENING A LOT OF THE TABLOIDS 
HAVE THE SAME STORY ON THE FRONT 
PAGE THIS IS BASICALLY LEAK FROM 
THE STATEMENT THE MCCANNS GAVE TO 
POLICE IN PORTUGAL AFTER MADELEINE 
MCCANN WENT MISSING KATE SPOKE 
YESTERDAY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE 
AGO THE LEAK IS THIS THAT 
MADELEINE HAD SAID MUMMY WHY

STRONG GROWTH IN THE CONFECTIONERY 
SIDE OF BUSINESS ABREAST OF SEVEN PER CENT 
CONTINUED DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH IN 
THE GUM BUSINESS SOMETHING TO CHEW

HOWEVER RAISED THEIR FIXED RATE 
MORTGAGES THAT CUT DIDN'T DO ANY 
GOOD FOR THE POUND WHICH HAS FALLEN

YESTERDAY INVESTORS ARE SWITCHING 
TO CURRENCIES WITH A HIGHER RATE OF 
RETURN THE EURO IS WORTH EIGHTY P. 
NEARLY TEN PENCE MORE THAN AT ITS 
LAUNCH IN TWO THOUSAND TWO ALL OF THIS WILL DO 
VERY WELL FOR THE BUDGET CHAIN

THEY STARTED BITING MY FEET THE 
LOCAL RUSSIAN THAT SAID DON'T 
WORRY THEY WILL MOVE AWAY AN 
AMAZING EXPERIENCE THE FIRST TIME 
I HAVE SWUM WITH THE LOOK OF WALES 
SOMETHING I WOULD WANT TO AGAIN IT IT SEEMS EXTRAORDINARY THAT WE COULD 
HEAR THE NOISE IT WAS NOISY WHEN 
YOU WERE DOWN THERE 
YOU COULD HEAR 
THE KICKING AND WHISTLING OF THE 
WALES TALKING TO EACH OTHER 
SUSSING OUT TO SEE WHO I WAS THEY 
WERE VERY GENTLE THEY CAME UP TO 
ME WE COULD TOUCH THEM THEY HAVE 
BEEN USED TO FREE DIVERS FOR THE 
LAST FEW YEARS 
THE AIR PART OF A 
CONSERVATION PROGRAMME 
YES UP IN 
THE WHITE SEA 
THEY ARE PARKED 
THEY LOOKED A WHITE TRANSLUCENT 
CAREER THEY ARE PART 
YES OF MOST WALES ARE A BLACK 
COLOUR 
THIS FREEDIVER YOU CAN SEE THERE 
HITCHING A LIFT 
IT IS AMAZING 
HAVE KNOWN JULIA FOR A FEW YEARS 
THROUGH FREE DIVING COMPETITIONS 
I'D GO TO COMPETITIONS AROUND THE 
WORLD I AM AN AVID FREEDIVER 
MYSELF I WAS IN THE BRITISH TEAM 
I WANTED TO GET SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF 
HER WITH THE WALES 
SHE HAS NO 
APPARATUS WITH HER SO IT MAKES THEM 
LESS SUSPICIOUS 
MAYBE L. WAS IN 
THE SAME SITUATION L. HAD THE 
OPTION OF WEARING A TACK BUT I WENT 
DOWN THE FREE DIVING ROUTE WITH A 
WET SUIT A PAIR OF FINES AND A 
SNORKEL AND JUMPED INTO THE SUB 
ZERO WATER MINUS TWO CELSIUS L. 
SAID TO THE LOCALS THEY SAID IS 
IT COLD THEY SAID NO GETTING 
THERE AND ENJOY IT 
HOW COLD WAS IT 
IT LOOKS RIDICULOUSLY COLD 
YES IT 
IS MINUS TWO IT IS SEA WATER AND 
IN ARCTIC CONDITIONS SEA WATER 
FREEZES BELOW ZERO L. HAVE GOT IT 
ON MY THERMOMETER ON MY WATCH IT 
IS VERY DIFFERENT TO DIVING IN 
FRESH WATER WHICH FREEZES AT ZERO 
AN UNBELIEVABLE PLACE TO VISIT 
ISN'T IT A LITTLE BIT DANGEROUS 
FIRST YOU HAVE TO GET IN AND OUT OF 
THE ICE YOU ARE SWIMMING WITH HIS 
ENORMOUS ANIMALS 
IN THIS AREA WE 
HAD A FAIRLY OPEN SPACE WHICH HAD 
BEEN CLEARED WE WERE DIVING 
THROUGH THE ICE IN THE WHOLE WE CUT 
IN MY FILM WITH B. B. C. SOUTH WEST FOR 
INSIDE OUT WE HAVE A LOT OF 
FOOTAGE WE WILL SHOW TONIGHT YOU YOU LITERALLY CUT A HOLE IN THE EYES 
HAD YOU MAKE SURE YOU GET BACK TO 
THE WHOLE 
YOU CAN SEE IT FROM THE 
BOTTOM YOU CAN SEE A GREEN GLOW 
LOOKING UP YOU AIM FOR THE IT 
AIM FOR IT 
HOW TO GET WARM WHEN 
YOU COME OUT 
WE WERE AGAIN IN SUB 
ZERO TEMPERATURES THE AIR 
TEMPERATURE WAS MINUS TWENTY CELSIUS WE 
BASICALLY GOT OUT OF THE WATER PUT 
A COAT ON JUMPED IN THE SNOWMOBILE 
AND BACK TO THE CABINS FIVE MINUTES 
AWAY 
WE WILL TALK AGAIN LATER AWAY VIEWERS MAY WANT SEE THOSE PICTURES 
AGAIN AGAIN JUST A REMINDER VIEWERS IN SOUTH 
WEST IN THE SOUTH WEST CAN SEE 
MORE ON THAT ON INSIDE OUT YOU CAN 
ALSO SEE IT ON THE B. B. C. IPLAYER 
STILL TO COME WE ARE GETTING 
MEASURED UP FOR OUR MORE OUR

GUIDELINES DENTISTS BLAME THE 
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ONE 
PRACTITIONER WHO HAS GIVEN UP N. H. S. 
TREATMENT ENTIRELY SAYS PATIENTS 
REQUIRING A LOT OF WORK ARE NOT 
FINANCIALLY VIABLE 
THERE WILL BE A 
SITUATION WHERE IT MAY WELL BE 
WORTHWHILE FOR THE DENTIST TO TURN 
TO THE PATIENT AND SAY HERE ARE 
SOME MONEY GO ELSEWHERE 
YOU CAN 
SEE MORE ON THAT ON INSIDE OUT AT 
SEVEN THIRTY P. M. THE OWNER OF MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED

WE HAVE A SMALL PROBLEM ON PUBLIC 
TRANSPORT FOR THE UNDERGROUND 
DELAYS ON THE CENTRAL LINE AFTER A

TOO BAD BUT THE SOUTHBOUND CARRIAGE 
IS BUILDING UP THIS IS A LOVELY 
PICTURE OF THE RIVER THAMES BUT 
THE AD IT IS TO SHADE THERE IS ONLY 
ONE WOOLWICH FERRY OPERATING 
BECAUSE OF MAINTENANCE WORK AND 
ALSO FOR RICHMOND THINGS ARE NOT

BRINGING THE RISK OF SHOWERS BY 
THIS AFTERNOON THE SHOWERS WILL 
BECOME MORE FREQUENT HEAVY AS WELL 
WITH THE RISK OF HELL WE WILL ALSO 
NOTICE FRESHENING WINDS FROM THE 
SOUTH HAIL A BLUSTERY BAND OF 
SHOWERS IS MOVING ITS WAY IN A 
MILD NIGHT TO COME IT LOOKS AS IF 
WE WILL SEE SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS ON 
SATURDAY ONE OR TWO ON SUNDAY THAT'S ALL FROM US 
HELLO THIS IS BREAKFAST WITH 
CHARLIE STAYT AND LOUISE MINCHIN 
OUR MAIN STORY THIS MORNING 
THOUSANDS OF ELDERLY PEOPLE IN 
ENGLAND ARE BEING FORCED TO PAY FOR 
LONG TERM CARE THAT THEY SHOULD BE 
GETTING FOR FREE THAT'S ACCORDING 
TO THE CHARITY AGE CONCERN 
THEY HAVE TOLD BREAKFAST THAT OLDER 
PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS 
ARE BEING ROUTINELY FAILED BY THE 
N. H. S. DESPITE NEW GOVERNMENT 
GUIDELINES THE FIGURES SHOW A DROP 
IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE GETTING THE 
FUNDING THEY ARE ENTITLED TO 
HERE AFTER EIGHT HUNDRED A M. WE WILL PUT 
SOME OF YOUR E. MAILS AND TEXTS TO 
AGE CONCERN AND ALSO THE N. H. S.

HER MOTHER HAD NOT COME WHEN THE 
CHILDREN WERE CRYING THE NIGHT 
BEFORE THE MCCANS' SPOKESMAN SAID

YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHY 
DOCUMENTATION THAT WAS IN THE 
POLICE FILES COVERED BY PORTUGESE 
JUDICIAL SECRECY IS NOT PUBLIC 
DOMAIN ITS NOT ONLY ILLEGAL IT IS 
OUTRAGEOUS 
A CONTROVERSIAL MET OFD OUTRAGEOUS GATHERING EVIDENCE USING TINYING

SUITED HIM BETTER GOLF IN THE DARK 
I'M ALL FOR THAT ANYTHING THAT 
HELPS ME NO LIGHTING ALLOWED NOT 
AT ALL THE CROWD OBVIOUSLY WERE 
THRILLED BUT YOU KNOW NICK FALDO 
SAID HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT HE 
WOULD HAVE COME OFF BUT WHEN YOU 
ARE IN THE MOOD YOU ARE IN THE 
MOOD MOOD YOU ARE 
IT IS ONE OF S. BEST KNOWN 
SONGS BELTED OUT BY SPORTS FANS 
AND AT THE LAST NIGHT OF THE PROMS 
IT WAS EVEN PICKED BY GORDON BROWN 
AS DES ERLT LAND DISKS BUT NOW 
JERUSALEM HAS BEEN BANNED BY 
SOUTHWARK CATHEDRAL THE VERSES 
DON'T PRAISE GOD AND ARE TOO 
NATIONALISTIC NATIONALISTIC WHAT DO THESE WORDS INSPIRE IN YOU 
AND DID THOSE FEET IN ANCIENT 
TIME TIME WALK UPON S. MOUNTAINS GREEN GREEN AND WAS THE HOLY LAMB OF GOD ON ENGLAND'S PLEASANT PASTURES SEEN SEEN AND DID THE COUNTENANCE DIVINE SHINE FORTH UPON OUR CLOUDED HILLS HILLS AND WAS JERUSALEM BUILDED HERE IT IS STIRRING STUFF LOVE IT 
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT MORE REVEREND 
DON PICARD IS THE EDITOR OF AN 
ONLINE DATA BASE OF HYMNS AND 
REVEREND RICHENDA LEIGH IS THE 
ANGLICAN CHAPLAIN AT THE LONDON 
METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY WHERE DO 
WE STAND ON THIS BEING A HYMN OR 
NOT 
IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS USED NOT IN CHURCH AND IT IS IN HYMNBOOKS 
YOU MIGHT SAY WELL IT IS A HYMN 
BUT WE TEND TO USE ALL SORTS OF 
THINGS IN CHURCH AND IN VARIOUS 
KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES THINGS LIKE 
YOU GET ALL SORTS OF WEIRD THINGS 
AT WEDDINGS AND FUNERALS THESE DAYS 
AND THEY ARE NOT REALLY HYMNS THE 
TECHNICAL ANSWER IS THAT A HYMN IS 
A SONG OF PRAISE TO GOD AND YOU ARE 
PUSHED TO SAY THAT JERUSALEM IS A 
SONG OF PRAISE TO GOD 
O. K. WHAT DO 
YOU THINK RY CHEN D. A. 
I THINK 
PEOPLE SING IT AS RICH RIC HENDA 
I THINK IT IS SUNG AS A PRAISE TO 
GOD 
WHAT IS IT TALKING ABOUT JESUS GOD COMING TO THIS COUNTRY 
IT IS 
SAYING THAT JESUS ISN'T HERE BUT WE 
SHOULD BUILD JERUSALEM 
FOR PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE HEARD THE SONG BUT NEVER 
THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT IT IS ABOUT 
WHAT IS BEING SAID 
WELL IF YOU 
LOOK AT IT RIGHT NOW AND FORGET 
ABOUT CONTEXT AND HISTORY WHAT IS 
BEING ASKED IS DID JESUS WALK HERE 
ARE THESE THE HILLS OF HIS YOUTH 
IS THIS THE HILLS OF IST YOUTH 
THE ANSWER IS NO THE IDEA HE CAME 
TO THIS COUNTRY 
THERE IS A VAGUE 
MYTH HE CAME TO GLASTONBURY WITH 
HIS UNCLE BUT IT IS NOT TRUE THEN 
IT IS SAYING ACTUALLY IT DIDN'T 
HAPPEN I'M GOING TO BUILD JERUSALEM 
TAKE MY ARROWS OF DESIRE AND I WILL 
BUILD A JERUSALEM IN ENGLAND AND 
MAKE IT A BETTER PLACE 
IF YOU 
EXPLAIN IT LIKE THAT IT DOES HAVE 
RELIGIOUS THEMES 
ONLY IF YOU THINK 
ABOUT SOMETHING BEING HE WILL YIDGE 
US WHAT IS TURNS YOU ON RELIGIOUS 
I THINK BLAKE'S ANSWERS TO THE 
QUESTIONS WAS IF ONLY IF ONLY 
JESUS HAD COME IF ONLY WE COULD 
GET HIM TO COME HERE HE THOUGHT OF 
IT AS A PROPHECY MAKING IN THE 
PRESENT WHAT HE SAW AS A VISION OF 
THE FUTURE 
IF PEOPLE ASK WHEN 
THEY DO SING IT IF THEY ARE 
THINKING SPIRITUALLY AND THEIR OWN 
MEANING DOES IT MATTER DO YOU GET 
TO A POINT WHERE IT TAKES ON ITS 
OWN MEANING IN PEOPLE'S SENTIMENTS 
IT DOES TAKE ON ITS OWN MEANING BUT 
PEOPLE BRING ALL SORTS OF MEANINGS 
INTO IT THAT'S WHY IT IS SUNG IN 
PLACES LIKE THE WOMEN'S INSTITUTE 
AND LIKE THE LAST NIGHT OF THE 
PROMS WHAT YOU ARE CELEBRATE 
WILLINGING IS YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT 
THE PROMS AND WHAT IT IS TO BELONG 
IN THOSE CONTEXTS IT IS NOTHING 
SHOULD IT BE BANNED 
I THINK IT IS 
INCREDIBLY PRETENTIOUS TO BAN IT 
IT IS LIKE SAYING PEOPLE CAN'T HAVE 
MAN ON A GRAVESTONE IT SPEAKS IT 
PEOPLE IT MAKES ME WANT TO 
SINGALONG AND AS YOU WERE SAYING 
THE HAIRS ON THE BACK OF YOUR NECK 
THAT SHOULD BE WHY PEOPLE SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO CHOOSE THINGS THAT MOVE 
THEM IN THEIR CHURCH IT IS THE 
CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND PEOPLE SHOULD 
BE ABLE TO OWN IT THEY HAVE A 
LEGAL RIGHT 
WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT 
SOUTHWARK ARE DOING WHAT IS YOUR 
SENTIMENT 
I THINK THEY ARE DOING SENTIMENT THE RIGHT THING IT IS THAT KIND OF 
SINGING IN CHAURCH THAT GIVES 
RELIGION A BAD NAME IN CHURCH 
THAT GIVES RELIGION A BAD NAME IT 
IS ALL ABOUT IF ONLY THINGS COULD 
HA BLAKE MEANT IT TO A CHALLENGE 
TO THE SOCIETY IN WHICH HE WAS HE 
WANTED PEOPLE TO CHANGE THINGS DO DO YOU SAY GO THE WHOLE HOG AND NEVER 
SING IT IN A CHURCH OR CATHEDRAL 
IF IT IS NOT A SING DON'T SING IT 
I WOULD PREFER IT WASN'T SUNG AS A 
HYMN 
BAN IT COMPLETELY FROM HYMN CHURCHES AND PLACES OF WORSHIP 
BANNING COMPLETELY IS STRONG 
LANGUAGE YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH 
PEOPLE AND SO SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT 
HAVE TO ARGUE WHETHER IT IS THE 
RIGHT THING TO DO BUT THE STARTING 
POSITION IS NO 
I WOULD SAY YES EVERY TIME LOVE IT 
ALL RIGHT WE WILL LEAVE IT IT THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH LOTS OF 
OUR VIEWERS REMINDING US THAT IT IS 
THE ANTHEM OF THE WOMEN'S INSTITUTE 
I DIDN'T KNOW THANK YOU FOR THAT 
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT YOU KNOW HOW 
TO GET IN CONTACT WITH US 
YOU ARE WATCHING BREAKFAST THE 
MAIN STORIES THE CHARITY AGE 
CONCERN SAYS THOUSANDS OF OLDER 
PEOPLE ARE BEING FORCED TO PAY FOR 
NURSING CARE THAT SHOULD BE FREE ON 
THE N. H. S. 
AND A COUNCIL HAS ADMITTED SPYING 
ON A FAMILY TO FIND OUT IF THEY 
WERE REALLY LIVING IN A SCHOOL 
CATCHMENT AREA 
COULD IT BE THE ULTIMATE TICKET TO 
RIDE WE MEET THE MAN HE TRAVELLED 
FROM LAND'S END TO JOHN O'GROATS 
FOR FREE BY USING HIS BUS PASS 
LET US TAKE A LOOK AT THE WEATHER 
IT IS A CHILLY START TO THE DAY 
ONCE AGAIN FOR THE REST OF THE 
WEEKEND THE FORECAST IS OF 
SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS SOME OF THE 
SHOWERS WILL BE HEAVY SOME 
THUNDERY SOME WILL HAVE HAIL AND 
SLEET MIXED IN THE SNOW WILL BE ON 
HIGHER GROUND LARGELY THE RADAR 
PICTURE SHOWS THAT TWO THIRDS OF 
RAIN IN THE NORTH EAST OF SCOTLAND 
AND ANOTHER OVER THE IRISH SEA WE 
ALSO HAVE PATCHY SHOWERS ACROSS THE 
SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND THEY WILL BE 
SPORADIC AND FOR MANY PARTS SOME 
SUNSHINE FURTHER NORTH INTO THE 
MIDLANDS WE HAVE HEAVIER SHOWERS 
AND THE RISK OF SOME SLEET ON AT 
LOWER LEVELS THE SAME ACROSS THE 
NORTH EAST OF SCOTLAND FOUR 
CELSIUS ANY BAND OF RAIN IS COMING 
UP THE IRISH SEA AFFECTING NORTHERN 
IRELAND THE SOUTH WEST OF SCOTLAND 
AND NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND THEN 
MORE SHOWERS ACROSS WALES AND THE 
SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND QUITE A BIT 
OF CLOUD AROUND THE OTHER FEATURE 
IN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE BRITISH 
ISLES IS IT IS MUCH BREEZIER IT 
WILL BECOME QUITE GUSSETS AROUND 
CORNWALL FOR THE REST OF THE DAY 
SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS TEMPERATURES 
PEAKING AT THIRTEEN CELSIUS THROUGH THIS 
EVENING MANY OF THE SHOWERS WILL 
DIE AWAY BUT THEY HAVE A NEW 
FEATURE COMING INTO THE SOUTH WEDGE 
SOUTH WEST WHICH WILL BRING SNOW 
ON THE HILLS THAT WILL CLEAR 
TOMORROW TOMORROW A DAY OF 
SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS SOME HEAVY 
AND THUNDERY SLOW MOVING 
ESPECIALLY OVER NORTHERN IRELAND 
SUNDAY SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS IF 
YOU ARE TAKING PART IN THE LONDON 
MARATHON YOU COULDN'T RUN INTO 
SOME SHOWERS YOU COULD RUN 
THAT LITTLE BIRDS SINGING IN THE 
BACKGROUND IS TRYING TO COMPETE 
WITH YOU 
AARON WHAT IS HAPPENING 
WE ARE 
GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE WEAK POUND 
HOLIDAYS SOME HOLIDAYS IN 
PARTICULAR A LOT OF YOU MAY HAVE 
ALREADY PLANNED TO JET TO SUNNY 
SHORES BUT THE QUESTION IS WHEN 
YOUR MONEY GO THE DISTANCE 
YESTERDAY WE SAW THE POUND FALL 
AGAIN AGAINST THE EURO A RECORD 
LOW FOLLOWING THE INTEREST RATE BY 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND ONE EUROS IT IS 
WORTH EIGHTY P. NOW TEMPERS WERE IT TEN 
PENCE MORE THAN WHEN IT WAS 
LAUNCHED IN TWO THOUSAND TWO 
IT WILL MAKE PEOPLE MORE WARY ABOUT 
WHERE THEY TRAVEL FURTHER AFIELD 
I DON'T THINK AT THE MOMENT IT WILL 
AFFECT ME THAT MUCH 
THE RATE OF 
EXCHANGE IS DEFINITELY NOT THAT 
GOOD IN SOUTHERN IRELAND YOU HAVE 
TO SPEND MORE FOR THE SAME 
I WENT 
TO NEAR BARCELONA IN SPAIN FOR A 
TOUR WITH THE UNIVERSITY AND I DID 
NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE EVERYTHING 
WAS MORE EXPENSIVE 
I DON'T THINK 
ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING NO NOT 
AT ALL L. L. HAVE COME BACK FROM THE 
U. S. THAT WAS IN MY FAVOUR GOING 
THAT WAY BECAUSE THE POUND IS SO 
STRONG THERE 
LET US GET A WORD HERE IN THE 
STUDIO I AM JOINED BY ALICE RISE 
ALISON RICE AND SANDY DAWE THE KEY 
QUESTION IS CAN BRITAIN CASH IN ON 
THE STRONG EURO AND PERSUADE PEOPLE 
TO HOLIDAY AT HOME 
SEVENTY PER CENT OR SO OF 
OUR OVERSEAS TRIPS SHORT BREAKS 
AND HOLIDAYS ARE TO THE EURO ZONE 
PEOPLE MAY THINK THEIR MONEY WENT 
GO AS FAR AND PERHAPS THEY WILL 
CONSIDER HOLIDAYING HERE IT GIVES 
US THE OPPORTUNITY OUR INBOUND 
MARKETS WE ARE MUCH MORE 
AFFORDABLE THERE IS A DOUBLE 
OPPORTUNITY 
ALISON DO YOU AGREE OPPORTUNITY WITH CASHING IN SOME WOULD SAY 
QUALITY HAS IMPROVED BUT IT HAS A 
LONG WAY TO GO TO COMPETE WITH 
EUROPE 
I DISAGREE WE TRAVEL EUROPE ABROAD WITH ROSE TINTED SPECTACLES 
YOU CAN GET PRETTY POOR 
ACCOMMODATION ABROAD AS WELL SOME 
IMPROVING ACCOMMODATION IS IN 
BRITAIN WHAT BRITAIN HAS TO OFFER 
WHICH OTHER COUNTRIES DON'T IT IS 
A VARIETY OF SCENERY THINGS TO DO 
YOU COULD GO TO A GOOD VALUE FOR 
MONEY HOLIDAY PARK ALL INCLUSIVE 
OR FIND YOURSELF A FABULOUS 
THATCHED COTTAGE IN THE MIDDLE OF 
NOWHERE I WOULD ADVISE THIS YEAR 
IF YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE YOUR MAIN 
HOLIDAY IN BRITAIN YOU SHOULD BOOK 
EARLY THOSE LOVELY COTTAGES WILL 
BE FULL QUITE SOON

TRY ON CLOTHES THAT'S THE QUESTION 
WE ARE ASKING THIS MORNING WHAT DO 
YOU THINK OF ME IN THIS ONE GOOD 
MORNING OUR MAIN STORY THOUSANDS 
OF ELDERLY PEOPLE IN ENGLAND ARE 
BEING FORCED TO PAY FOR LONG TERM 
CARE THAT THEY SHOULD BE GETTING 
FOR FREE ACCORDING TO THE CHARITY 
AGE CONCERN THEY SAY THAT OLDER 
PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS 
ARE BEING ROUTINELY FAILED BY THE 
N. H. S. DESPITE NEW GOVERNMENT 
GUIDELINES LATEST FIGURES SHOW A 
DROP IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
GETTING THE FUNDING THEY ARE 
ENTITLED TO 
THIS IS A PHOTO OF MY MOTHER I 
GUESS TAKEN IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES 
MEMORIES OF YOUTH BUT IN OLD AGE 
ELIZABETH'S MOTHER SUFFERED FROM 
DEMENTIA SHE NEEDED FOR YEARS CARE 
IN A NURSING HOME CARE ELIZABETH 
PAID FOR BUT SHE LATER FOUND OUT 
THE N. H. S. SHOULD HAVE PICKED UP THE 
BILL 
I HAD TO SELL HER BUNGALOW BILL THE PLACE THAT SHE LOVED TO 
GENERATE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY THE 
FEES AND YOU THINK WHY SHOULD I 
DO THIS WHEN FOR ANY OTHER ILLNESS 
YOU WOULDN'T BE FORCED TO DO THIS 
AFTER LONG BATTLE SHE FINALLY 
WON COMPENSATION CARE ADVICE 
CENTRES LIKE THIS ONE OFFER HELP TO 
PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY ADVISERS 
HERE SAY MANY CALLS ARE FROM PEOPLE 
CONFUSED ABOUT HOW THEY WILL BE 
CARED FOR AND WHO WILL PAY FOR IT 
GOOD MORNING COUNSELLING CARE 
THE SITUATION WAS SUPPOSED TO GET 
EASIER IN OCTOBER LAST YEAR THE 
GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED NEW 
GUIDELINES TO END REGIONAL 
VARIATIONS IN THE WAY LONG TERM 
CARE FUNDING IS ALLOCATED BUT N. H. S. 
FIGURES ANALYSED BY AGE CONCERN AND 
GIVEN TO THE B. B. C. SUGGEST THAT THE 
POSTCODE LOTTERY HAS GOT WORSE 
WE ARE STILL SEEING MINI PRIMARY 
CARE TRUSTS OFFERING OUTRAGEOUSLY 
LOW LEVELS OF SUPPORT MANY TO 
PEOPLE WITH REALLY QUITE DESPERATE 
NEEDS AND THE DISPARITY IS 
SOMETIMES ENORMOUS GLOUCESTERSHIRE GLOUCESTERSHIRE PRIMARY CARE TRUST HAS BEEN 
HIGHLIGHTED AS THE WORST IN ENGLAND 
BY COMPARISON THESE P. C. T. IS ARE THE 
BEST PERFORMERS THESE ARE THE 
STARK CONTRASTS WHICH ARE IN 
EVIDENCE IN ENGLAND THESE PCTS 
THESE ARE VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS 
THAT PEOPLE MAKE AT LOCAL LEVEL 
THEY ARE HIGHLY EMOTIVE DECISIONS 
OFTEN WHEN FAMILIES ARE IN A CRISIS 
WE ARE BEGINNING TO BED THAT 
GUIDANCE IN AND WE WILL REVIEW IT 
IN THE AUTUMN 
THE N. H. S. ONLY FUNDS THE MOST SERIOUS 
CASES NEEDING ONGOING MEDICAL 
ATTENTION THOSE WHO DON'T QUALIFY 
OFTEN END UP PAYING THE FULL COST 
OF CARE IF THEY HAVE ASSETS OF 
MORE THAN TWENTY ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED IT REMAINS A 
COMPLICATED AND CONFUSING PICTURE 
AGE CONCERN FEARS THAT TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE STILL 
LOSING OUT 
IN A FEW MOMENTS WE WILL BE 
TALKING TO AGE CONCERN AND THE N. H. S. 
CONFEDERATION ABOUT THAT STORY WE 
HAVE GOT A LOT OF E. MAILS FROM YOU 
WE WILL BE READING OUT SOME OF 
THOSE TOO 
THE COUNCIL HAS ADMITTED SPYING ON 
A FAMILY USING LAWS DESIGNED TO 
TRACK CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS TO 
FIND OUT IF THEY WERE REALLY LIVING 
IN A SCHOOL CATCHMENT AREA THEY 
SAY IT WAS RIGHT TO TREAT THE CASE 
AS A POTENTIAL CRIMINAL MATTER BUT 
THE FAMILY THEY WERE WATCHING SAY 
IT WAS A CREEPY INFRINGEMENT OF 
THEIR LIBERTY 
MANY OF TODAY'S PAPERS FOR A SHOCK 
AND OUTRAGE AT THE NEWS THAT PALACE 
DESIGNED TO TACKLE TERRORISM WERE 
USED TO SPY ON A FAMILY OVER SCHOOL 
PLACES POOLE COUNCIL ADMITS IT 
WATCHED A FAMILY AT HOME AND IN 
THEIR DAILY MOVEMENTS TO FIND OUT 
IF THEY LIVED IN THE CATCHMENT AREA 
FOR A SCHOOL WHICH THERE ARE THREE 
YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WANTED TO ATTEND 
WHICH THEIR THREE YEAR OLD 
DAUGHTER THEIR MOTHER TOLD THE 
BOURNEMOUTH ECHO 
WE DO IT VERY RARELY AS A LAST 
RESORT AND WHAT WE DO IS VERY 
LIMITED AND THEN WE SHARE THE 
INFORMATION WITH THE PARENTS 
AFTERWARDS AND THEN IT'S FORGOTTEN 
DESTROYED DESTROYED THE LEGISLATION USED BY THE COUNCIL 
IS NORMALLY USED TO MONITOR 
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IT ALLOWS 
SURVEILLANCE AND THE INTERCEPTION 
OF COMMUNICATIONS IF COUNCILS 
SUSPECT CRIMINAL ACTS HAVE TAKEN 
PLACE 
THIS IS PARTICULARLY PLACE CONCERNING THAT THE LEGISLATION 
ALLOWS SO MANY DIFFERENT PUBLIC 
AUTHORITIES I THINK IT IS OVER SIX HUNDRED 
AND I THINK THEY SHOULD BE FAR MORE 
INFREQUENTLY USED 
THE FAMILY WERE CLEARED OF ANY 
WRONGDOING AND ONLY FOUND OUT THEY 
HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED WHEN TOLD BY 
THE PRIMARY SCHOOL POOLE COUNCIL 
SAYS THIS IS THE THIRD TIME IT HAS 
CONDUCTED SURVEILLANCE LIKE THIS 
OVER SCHOOL PLACES 
MADELEINE MCCANN'S PARENTS HAVE 
CONDEMNED THE LEAK OF REMARKS THEY 
MADE INTERVIEWS CARRIED OUT BY 
PORTUGUESE POLICE THE TRANSCRIPTS 
SHOW THAT ON THE MORNING BEFORE 
MADELEINE DISAPPEARED SHE ASKED 
WHY HER MOTHER HAD NOT COME AND 
THE CHILDREN WERE CRYING THE NIGHT 
BEFORE BUT A SPOKESMAN SAID THE 
LEAK WAS DELIBERATE SMEAR 
YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHY 
DOCUMENTATION WHICH WAS IN THE 
POLICE FILES COVERED BY PORTUGUESE 
JUDICIAL SECRECY IS NOW IN THE 
PUBLIC DOMAIN IT IS NOT ONLY 
ILLEGAL IT'S OUTRAGEOUS 
A CONTROVERSIAL METHOD OF GATHERING 
EVIDENCE USING TINY FRAGMENTS OF 
D. N. A. HAS BEEN GIVEN THE ALL CLEAR BY 
THE GOVERNMENT'S SCIENTISTS TOUCH 
THE END A WHICH CAN IDENTIFY THE 
PERSON BY JUST TWO OR THREE CELLS 
HAD BEEN SUSPENDED DUE TO QUESTIONS 
OVER ITS RELIABILITY AT THE OMAGH 
BOMB TRIAL TOUCH D. N. A. SIX ENERGY

GOOD MORNING WHEN HE STARTED HERE

HAS BEEN PUTTING THAT TO GOOD USE 
OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS PRINCE

STRAINS OF LEARNING TO FLY WITH HIS 
CLASSMATES THE SAME R. A. F. INSTRUCTOR 
SAT ALONGSIDE HIM DURING ALL OF HIS 
EARLY FLIGHTS WHEN HE FIRST WENT 
SOLO HE TOLD ME IT HAD BEEN 
NERVE RACKING EXPERIENCE 
SO FAR 
IT LOOKS ALL RIGHT BUT IT WAS ONE 
OF THOSE EXPERIENCES WHERE I 
THOUGHT HOPEFULLY A LITTLE BIT 
LONGER IN THE AIR AND THE NEXT 
THING I KNOW THEY'RE TELLING ME TO 
GET ON WITH IT L. JUST DID IT AND 
ONCE I GOT UP INTO THE AIR IT WAS 
FINE FINE SINCE THEN THE PRINCE HAS 
PROGRESSED TO FLYING BIGGER 
AIRCRAFT HIS R. A. F. EXPERIENCE IS 
PART OF THE PREPARATION FOR THE 
TIME WHEN AS KING HE WILL BE HEAD 
OF BRITAIN'S 
ARMED FORCES THAT GRADUATION 
CEREMONY IS DUE TO BEGIN HERE AT 
COLLEGE HALL BEHIND ME AT ELEVEN 
O'CLOCK THIS MORNING ONCE PRINCE 
WILLIAM'S ATTACHMENT TO THE R. A. F. IS 
DONE NEXT UP FOR HIM IS A STINT 
WITH THE ROYAL NAVY 
COMING UP WE WILL MEET THE MAN 
WHO WENT THE LENGTH OF BRITAIN ON 
THE BUS FOR FREE NO ONE IN 
ENGLAND SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR 
MEDICAL CARE WHICH THEY MIGHT NEED 
AS THEY GET OLDER EVEN IF THEY 
RECEIVE THAT CARE RESEARCH 
SUGGESTS THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING 
FORCED TO FUND THEIR LONG TERM CARE 
DESPITE NEW GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES 
INTENDED TO MAKE THE SYSTEM FAIRER 
JOINING US NOW THE DIRECTOR OF THE 
PRIMARY TRUST NETWORK AND A 
REPRESENTATIVE OF AGE CONCERN 
LET'S JUST TRY AND BE CLEAR SO 
SOME PEOPLE WHO SHOULD GET MEDICAL 
CARE NURSING CARE ARE NOT GETTING 
IT 
YES AND THEY ARE ALSO IT ENTITLED TO WIDER SUPPORT FROM THE 
N. H. S. IF THEIR PRIMARY NEED IS FOR 
HEALTH CARE THEY PROBABLY WON'T 
NEED TO STAY IN HOSPITAL THEY MAY 
BE IN A NURSING HOME OR IN THEIR 
OWN HOME THE N. H. S. IS REQUIRED TO 
PROVIDE CARE FOR THOSE PEOPLE AND 
IN MANY CASES IT IS NOT DOING SO 
THE FIGURES WE ARE SEEING ARE 
SHOWING HUGE DISPARITIES ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY AND THERE APPEAR TO BE 
SOME REAL BLACKSPOTS BASED ON THE 
FIGURES OF THE N. H. S. THEMSELVES 
DISPARITIES IS ONE WAY OF 
DESCRIBING IT BUT WHAT THIS BOILS 
DOWN TO IS THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE 
SIMPLY NOT BEING LOOKED AFTER IN 
THE WAY THEY SHOULD AND THEY ARE 
PAYING FOR THINGS THEY ARE NOT 
GETTING 
HISTORICALLY THERE WAS GETTING VARIATION IN THE INTERPRETATION OF 
WHAT 
WHAT IS HEALTH CARE AND WHAT IS 
SOCIAL CARE THE GOVERNMENT 
RECOGNISED THAT AND BACK IN OCTOBER 
THEY SET GUIDELINES TO MAKE SURE 
THAT EVERYBODY WITH THE SAME NEED 
WHEREVER THEY ARE IN THE COUNTRY 
CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME LEVEL 
OF N. H. S. CARE THIS GUIDANCE CAME OUT 
AT THE END OF LAST YEAR THE AIM IS 
TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO 
DISCREPANCIES 
BUT CLEARLY THAT IS DISCREPANCIES NOT WORKING 
I THINK WE NEED TO 
BE CAUTIOUS WITH THE DATA THAT 
BRENDAN IS REFERRING TO SOME OF 
THAT IS NOT ACCURATE FOR EXAMPLE 
THE PRIMARY CARE TRUST WERE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING THIS CARE 
IN PLACE WHO ARE BOTTOM OF THE 
TABLE THAT IS BEING PRODUCED HAVE 
PUBLISHED THEIR FIGURES TODAY 
WHICH SHOW THE FIGURES ARE ACTUALLY 
A LOT HIGHER THAN ARE IN THE REPORT 
IN WAY THIS COMES DOWN TO WHAT 
IS A VERY EMOTIVE ISSUE SAY YOU'RE 
GRANDPARENT HAS DEMENTIA THEY ARE 
IN THEIR OWN HOME WHAT HAPPENS IS 
THAT PAID FOR OR IS IT NOT PAID 
FOR OR DOES IT DEPEND WHERE THEY 
LIVE 
UNFORTUNATELY IF THEY HAVE LIVE DEMENTIA IT IS LIKELY THAT THEY 
WILL MISS OUT 
DEMENTIA IS 
EXCLUDED 
NOT ALWAYS BUT EXCLUDED FREQUENTLY IF THEY HAVE OTHER 
COMPLICATING FACTORS THEY HAVE A 
MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING THE 
SUPPORT I SUPPOSE WE WOULD AGREE 
WITH DAVID THAT CLEARLY SOME OF THE 
NUMBERS THAT THE N. H. S. ITSELF IS 
PROVIDING ON THIS PROBLEM ARE NOT 
GOOD BUT FROM WHAT WE HEAR ON THE 
GROUND FROM N. H. S. SITUATIONS LOCALLY 
WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING AND 
EXPLAINING THE SITUATION THEIR 
RELATIVES ARE IN WE ARE CONFIDENT 
THAT THERE ARE STILL BIG 
DISPARITIES AND THAT PEOPLE 
ABSOLUTELY WHO SHOULD BE GETTING 
ASSISTANCE ARE NOT GETTING IT HOW HOW IS IT ACCEPTABLE THAT THERE ARE 
THESE DISPARITIES AND PEOPLE ARE 
BEING MADE TO PAY FOR THINGS WHICH 
THEY SHOULD NOT BE MADE TO PAY FOR 
I DO NOT THINK IT IS ACCEPTABLE FOR 
ANY DISPARITIES WHICH ARE NOT BASED 
ON NEED THE WAY THIS WORKS IS 
TEAM OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO AN 
ASSESSMENT OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL WHO 
MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR N. H. S. CARE THAT 
ASSESSMENT WILL LOOK AT WHAT THE 
CONDITION IS WHAT THE LEVEL OF 
COMPLEXITY IS WHAT LEVEL OF 
UNCERTAINTY THERE MIGHT BE IN TERMS 
OF CARE IT IS THAT ASSESSMENT 
WHICH DRIVES WHETHER N. H. S. FUNDING IS 
USED 
THIS IS ONE VIEWER FROM USED PLYMOUTH WHO SAYS TO QUALIFY 
YOUR CARE NEEDS TO BE BRILLIANTLY 
NURSING THIS NEEDS TO BE ASSESSED 
BY THE N. H. S. THIS IS NONSENSE THE 
BODY WHO END UP PAYING FOR YOUR 
CARE IS THE ONE ASSESSING IT I 
THINK THERE MAY BE AN UNDERLYING 
SUSPICION THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
COMING IN TO ASSESS YOU ARE WORKING 
IT OUT ON THE BASIS OF HOW LITTLE 
IT COULD COST THEM 
IT'S DEFINITELY THE CASE THIS IS 
NOT A HIGH PRIORITY IN WHERE THE 
N. H. S. WANTS TO SPEND IT'S MONEY FOR 
THAT REASON IT'S DEFINITELY A 
CONCERN THAT SOME OF THE CRITERIA 
AND SOME OF THE DECISIONS 
HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN DRIVEN ON 
COST GROUNDS RATHER THAN THE 
GROUNDS OF NEED THE QUOENS FOR 
THOSE PEOPLE ON THE WRONG END OF 
DECISIONS HAVE BEEN HORRIFIC WHEN WHEN DOES THAT STOP HAPPENING IT'S IT'S ALREADY STOPPED IT'S CLEAR THAT 
DECISIONS ARE NOT MADE ON FINANCIAL 
GROUNDS THE ASSESSMENTS ARE MADE 
BY HEALTH PROFESSIONALS NOT BY 
FINANCIAL EXPERTS OR MANAGERS 
THOSE DECISIONS SHOULD NOT BE MADE 
ON FINANCIAL GROUNDS IT'S NOT 
ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY THE CARE COSTS 
IT'S WHAT THE NEED IS THAT IS HOW 
THE SYSTEM WORKS 
WE HAVE ALREADY 
AGREED THE SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING 
SO WHEN WILL IT WORK PROPERLY WHEN 
WILL THE DISCREPANCIES STOP 
HAPPENING 
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE HAPPENING AGREED THAT CLEARLY IF IT IS A NEW 
SYSTEM IT IS BEDDING IN IT IS 
IMPORTANT WE ARE MAKING SURE THIS 
SYSTEM IS WORKING PROPERLY L. AGREE 
WITH BRENDAN IT'S WRONG FOR PEOPLE 
NOT TO GET ACCESS TO THE CARE THEY 
SHOULD WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT 
IS NOT THE CASE 
ALSO THIS IS 
PEOPLE AT THEIR WORST TIME ELDERLY 
PEOPLE FAMILIES WORRIED ON A 
PRACTICAL SENSE WHAT CAN YOU DO IF 
THE ASSESSMENT COMES IN AND YOU 
DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT WHAT DO YOU 
DO DO THE FIRST STEP IS TO TAKE A LOOK AT 
THE REASONS FOR THE ASSESSMENT NOT 
FINDING IN YOUR FAVOUR TO REALLY 
INSIST YOU SEE THE REASONING AND 
NOT JUST THE DECISION SOMETIMES 
YOU WON'T BE GIVEN THAT BY THE N. H. S. 
IN SOME CASES SECOND THING IS TO 
ASK ABOUT THE APPEALS PROCESS 
THERE IS AN APPEAL PROCESS AND YOU 
CAN APPEAL IT WITH THE N. H. S. IF YOU 
FEEL YOU ARE GETTING NO WHERE AND 
YOU ARE HITTING YOUR HEAD AGAINST 
BRICK WALL THAT YOUR LOVED ONE HAS 
A CLEAR NEED THAT ISN'T BEING MET 
BY THE N. H. S. GO TO THE CITIZENS 
ADVICE BUREAU IF YOU HAVE 
PARTICULAR ILLNESS OR CONDITION GO 
TO CHIRT THAT SUPPORTS PEOPLE 
WITH THAT CONDITION AND GET SOME 
INDEPENDENT ADVICE CHARITY THE THE TIME NOW IS EIGHT SEVENTEEN A M. COMING UP 
THERE IS EQUALITY IN SCIENCE AND 
SPORT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO MUSIC 
AT SCHOOL WHY IS THERE STILL SUCH A 
GENDER GAP WE MEET THE MAN WHO 
TOOK THESE AMAZING SHOTS ON A 
SUBZERO SWIM WITH BELUGA WHALES I I COULDN'T SLEEP IN THAT BED THERE 
WAS A DEAD FLEA IN THE BED SHE 
SAYS THAT WILL DO YOU NO HARM L. 
SAID I KNOW BUT THERE WAS FORTY THOUSAND 
THAT CAME TO THE FUNERAL FRANK FRANK CARSON IS BACK ON THE ROAD LET'S 
GET YOU UP TO DATE ON THE WEATHER 
FOR THE WEEKEND THE WEATHER FOR 
THE WEEKEND IS EASY IT'S SUNSHINE

NORTHERN IRELAND THE SOUTH WEST OF

ENGLAND FOR WALES AND THE SOUTH 
WEST OF ENGLAND WE ARE LOOKING AT A 
FAIR BIT OF CLOUD AND ALSO SOME 
SHOWERS ANOTHER DIFFERENCE IN THE 
WEATHER IN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE 
COUNTRY TODAY IS IT'S GOING TO BE 
BREEZIER THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE 
PAST FEW DAYS THAT WILL TAKE THE 
EDGE OFF THE TEMPERATURES FOR MOST 
THE FORECAST IS ONE OF SUNSHINE AND 
SHOWERS TOP TEMPERATURES ARE 
PEAKING AT THIRTEEN DEGREES CELSIUS AS 
WE GO THROUGH THE EVENING AND 
OVERNIGHT PERIOD MANY OF THE 
ZHOERS WILL TEND TO DIE AWAY 
SHOWERS WILL TEND TO DIE AWAY WE 
HAVE A NEW SYSTEM COMING IN ACROSS 
THE SOUTH WEST OF WALES THE 
NORTHERN EXTENT OF THAT WE ARE NOT 
SURE ABOUT BUT IT WILL BE 
ACCOMPANIED BY GUSTY WINDS 
TOMORROW WHEN THAT CLEARS IT'S 
SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS TODAY SLOW 
MOVING ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND FOR

AT SOME SHOWERS THAT IS THE 
FORECAST BACK TO YOU TWO 
WE HAVE A WHOLE SET OF PEOPLE HERE 
MANY PEOPLE CAN BOAST THEY HAVE 
TRAVELLED FROM LAND'S END TO JOHN 
O'GROATS BY CAR OR BOAT BUT 
RICHARD ELLOWAY IS UNIQUE HE HAS 
MADE IT BY A FREE BUS PASS HE IS 
CURRENTLY IN GLASGOW WITH OUR 
SCOTLAND CORRESPONDENT LORNA GORDON 
DOING THAT ENTIRE JOURNEY WITHOUT 
SPENDING A PEPE HE DID IT ALL BY 
USING LOCAL BUSES WHAT AN 
INCREDIBLE JOURNEY TO DO WHAT DID 
HE DO HE WEST END FROM LAND'S END 
TO BRISTOL HE THEN WENT CROSS 
COUNTRY TO CAMBRIDGE AND THEN UP 
THE EASTERN SIDE OF ENGLAND THEN 
HE STAYED IN LINCOLN SCARBOROUGH 
AND BERWICK BEFORE CROSSING THE 
BORDER AND OVERNIGHTING IN 
INVERNESS BEFORE ARRIVING IN JOHN 
O'GROATS HE TOOK A WEEK TO DO THAT 
HE WENT ALL THE WAY THERE AND HE IS 
COMING ALL THE WAY BACK AGAIN HE 
IS WITH US HERE WAITING TO CATCH 
THE NEXT BUS ON THE JOURNEY WHY 
BECAUSE IT CAME INTO BEING FOR 
ENGLISH RESIDENTS ON THE FIRST OF THE 
MONTH I WANTED TO BE AT LAND END 
TO BE THE FIRST PERSON ON THE FIRST 
OFF PEAK BUS OF THE DAY IN MY 
JOURNEY TO ACHIEVE THE FIRST LONG 
DISTANCE TRIP IN ENGLAND WHICH I 
MANAGED TO DO AFTER FIVE MONTHS AND 
THEN TO BE THE FIRST PERSON TO GET 
TO JOHN O'GROATS WHICH IS A TRIP 
WHICH INTRIGUES ME BECAUSE I AM 
MEMBER OF THE LAND END TO JOHN 
O'GROATS SITUATION HOW DID YOU 
TRAVEL TO SCOTLAND BECAUSE IT 
DOESN'T APPLY HERE 
SCOTTISH BUSES WERE KIND IN GIVING 
ME FREE PASS 
I KNOW YOU ARE 
CATCHING YOUR NEXT BUS IN HALF AN 
HOUR YOU HAVE YOUR LUGGAGE WITH 
YOU HAVE YOU BEEN TRAVELLING 
LIGHT 
FAIRLY IT WAS A FALSE START LIGHT WHEN I GOT HOME ON THE FIRST DAY I 
FOUND MY SUITCASE WAS TOO BIG SO I 
DITCHED A LOT OF LUGGAGE L. FOUND I 
WOULD RATHER SHELF A CHANGE OF 
SOCKS EVERY DAY IN FAVOUR OF MY CUP 
AND SAUCER BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE 
DRINKING COFFEE OUT OF PAPER CUPS 
THE HIGH POINTS THE HIGH POINT 
CAME AFTER A DISASTER WHEN I GOT 
INTO LINKEN THERE WAS NO 
ACCOMMODATION GOT IN VERY LATE I 
DIDN'T KNOW MY WAY AROUND THE CITY 
BUT A PERSON CAME MY AID AND FOUND 
A LOVELY BED AND BREAKFAST FOR ME 
AND TOOK ME TO THE BUS STATION THE 
NEXT MORNING 
I KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR 
NEXT BUS TO CATCH SHORTLY YOU ARE 
ON TO BLACKPOOL ALL GOING WELL 
RICHARD WILL MAKE IT TO LIVERPOOL 
BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY VERY 
CIVILISED SOMETHING CIVILISED 
ABOUT TAKING A CUP AND SAUCER WITH 
YOU AS YOU TRAVEL IS THERE A 
GENDER DIVIDE WHEN IT COMES TO 
MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS WHILE SCHOOLS 
DO THEIR BEST TO ENCOURAGE EQUALITY 
IN SPORT AND SCIENCE IT SEEMS IT 
HASN'T REACHED THE ORCHESTRA YET 
WHILE THE GUITAR ATTRACTS BOYS 
GIRLS ARE MORE LIKELY TO PICK UP A 
CLARINET WE ASKED CHILDREN WHY 
THAT MIGHT BE 
I PLAY PIANO I 
THINK GIRL CAN PLAY ANY INSTRUMENT 
THEY LIKE 
I PLAY THE GUITAR I 
THINK THEY CAN PLAY 
USUALLY PLAY LOUDER 
I PLAY GUITAR 
I GO TO A GIRL'S SCHOOL NOT MANY 
PLAY IT 
I THINK GIRLS ARE QUIETER 
THAN BOYS AND BOYS ARE MORE 
ENERGETIC SO THEY PLAY LOUDER 
THINGS 
I PLAY THE GUITAR THE THINGS LOUDNESS IS USUALLY FOR BOYS LIKE 
ROCK BANDS BUT SOMETIMES GIRLS LIKE 
TO DO IT AS A SKILL 
I PLAY THE 
VIOLIN I THINK IT'S MORE FOR WOMEN 
REALLY REALLY I PLAY THE FLUTE THINK DRUMS AND 
GUITARS ARE FOR BOYS AND I THINK 
FLUTES AND SACKS PHONES AND 
TRUMPITS ARE FOR GIRLS 
IN NUTSHELL DID YOU PLAY EVERYTHING 
PIANO NOT VERY WELL EVERYTHING PROFESSOR SUE ELLEN IS HERE WITH US

THE GIRLS FAVOUR FLUTES AND HARP 
SINGING AND ALSO OBOE AND CLARINET 
WHY IS THAT 
THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION WE DIDN'T 
ASK THAT QUESTION IN RESEARCH IT 
LOOKS LIKE IT'S TRADITION THE WAY 
WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE IT THERE IS A 
TENDENCY FOR THE GIRLS TO PLAY THE 
SMALLER HIGHER PITCHED INSTRUMENTS 
THERE IS THE GIRLS TO PLAY THE 
LOWER LARGER INSTRUMENTS THE HARP 
IS THE EXCEPTION TO THAT 
I WAS 
ABOUT TO SAY THAT BOYS LIKE HITTING 
THINGS SO THEY WOULD LIKE THE DRUMS 
BUT THEN I AM SLIPPING INTO 
STEREOTYPES DANIEL YOU ARE THE 
ONLY YOUNG MAN HERE HOW COME YOU

YOU HAD AN ACCIDENT WHICH LED TO 
YOU BEING IN AN WHEELCHAIR WHAT 
HAPPENED 
I HAD JUST LEFT PRIMARY HAPPENED SCHOOL IN NINETY SEVEN AND I WAS OUT PLAYING 
WITH FRIENDS HIDE AND SEEK AND I 
DECIDED IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO HIDE 
UP A TREE L. WAS ABOUT TWENTY FOOT HIGH 
AND THE BRANCH SNAPPED AND I FELL 
TO THE BOTTOM AND BROKE MY BACK AND 
THEN WAS PARALYSED FROM THE WASTE 
DOWN 
HOW DID YOU YOU GET INVOLVED DOWN IN SPORT AFTER THAT 
I WAS ALWAYS 
AN ACTIVE YOUNGSTERS BUT THROUGH MY 
WELL I SPENT A FEW MONTHS IN A 
SPINAL UNIT IT WAS PART OF MY 
REHAB AS WELL IN THE NORTH WEST 
WHICH IS WHERE I'M FROM BLACKPOOL 
THERE WAS A FEW LIKE I WENT TO A 
RACING CLUB IN LIVERPOOL WHERE I 
MET MY FIRST COACH AND BASICALLY 
BUILT FROM THERE 
I'M CURIOUS I 
KNOW YOU GO INTO SCHOOLS AND YOU 
TALK TO THEM ABOUT IT WHAT DO KIDS 
THINK ABOUT YOU AND YOUR 
ACHIEVEMENTS HOW DO THEY REACT TO 
YOU 
THEY ASK ALL SORTS OF YOU QUESTIONS 
WHAT IS THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS THEY ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN THE 
PHYSIOLOGICAL SIDE AND THE CHAIR 
SOME OF THE KIDS ARE ONLY SIX OR 
SEVEN AND THEY ARE LIKE I HAVE 
ONE OF THOSE YOU THINK REALLY 
THEY ARE FUNNY AND ASK INTERESTING 
QUESTIONS THEY ARE REALLY INTO IT 
THEY ARE ALL OBSESSED WITH SPEED 
AND THEY THINK IT IS PRETTY MEAN A 
MEAN MACHINE 
YOU DO THAT WITH 
REBUILDING LIVES THROUGH SPORT 
THAT IS A FANTASTIC PROJECT WITH 
THE SPINAL INJURES ASSOCIATION IT 
IS ABOUT GETTING NEWLY INJURED 
PATIENTS AND PEOPLE WITH SPINAL 
INJURIES INTO SPORT FUNDING SPORT 
AT GRASSROOTS LEVEL WHICH IS VERY 
IMPORTANT YOU KNOW WE ARE LOOKING

ATHLETES TO BRING THEM THROUGH AND 
GET THEM TO THE TOP 
WELL LOTS AND 
LOTS OF LUCK 
GOOD LUCK AT THE WEEKEND AND FOR 
THE REST OF THE YEAR 
NICE TO SEE YOU 
THANK YOU SUE 
NOW DO YOU SUIT A SHROON OR ARE YOU 
COOL IN A COUPE A SALOON 
OR WOULD YOU BE SMOOTHER IN A 
PEOPLE MOVER 
ONE CAR MANUFACTURER THINKS WE 
SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE 
VEHICLE WE DRIVE AROUND IN THEY 
HAVE SET UP A CAR CHANGING ROOM SO 
WE CAN TRY THEM ON FOR SIZE 
RICHARD WESTCOTT IS MEASURING UP 
SOME MOTORS IN NOTTINGHAM FOR US 
MORNING GOOD MORNING L. HAVE SOME 
CLASSIC MOTORS BUT SHOULD YOU TRY 
ON YOUR CAR LIKE YOU TRY ON YOUR 
CLOTHES GO INTO A CHANGING ROOM 
AND LOOK IN THE MIRRORS DO THESE 
CARS SUIT THESE GUYS YOU HAVE YOUR 
SAVILLE ROW WITH THE ANGLIA AND 
THE WOLSELEY THEN YOU HAVE YOUR 
ITALIAN STYLE CUT SUITS WE HAVE 
BEEN THINKING ALL MORNING HOW TO 
DESCRIBE THESE I CANNOT THINK OF 
SIGNIFICANT DIPLOMATIC A FABULOUS 
OLD CLASSIC RUNNING A LONG TIME OF 
CHEF ROW LAY THINK YOU SHOULD TRY 
ON A CAR WHEN YOU GO INTO THEIR 
SHOWROOM CHEVROLET 
I WENT TO GIVE IT A GO BE HONEST 
HOW DO I LOOK IN MY CAR THANKS A 
LOT IT HAS BEEN A BRILLIANT 
RELYAL LITTLE RUN AROUND ANYWAY 
MOST OF US HAVE NO IDEA HOW WE LOOK 
WHEN WE ARE DRIVING ACCORDING TO 
CHEVROLET SO IT HAS BUILT A 
CHANGING ROOM 
I'M LOOKING FOR 
SOMETHING MAYBE IN SILVER 
WHAT YOU THINK OF THAT 
IT TAKES 
POWERS OF MAY DO I LOOK YOUNGER 
IT TAKES ABOUT FIVE YEARS OF FEAR 
THE I WON'T HAVE IT IN A BOX I 
WILL DRIVE IT SHAPE STRAIGHT OUT 
OF THE WORKSHOPS THE ALL GOOD FUN 
BUT IS IT USEFUL OR SALES GIMMICK 
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU GIMMICK WENT OUT TO BUY A NEW SUIT OR A NEW 
PAIR OF SHOES WITHOUT TRYING IT ON 
IT IS UNIMAGINABLE WHY DO EXPECT 
CUSTOMERS TO DO THE SAME WITH A CAR 
THE BUT YOU WEAR A SUIT YOU DON'T 
WEAR A CAR 
YOU DO WEAR A SUIT BUT 
YOU ARE WEARING A CAR AS WELL IT 
BETRAYS YOUR PERSONALITY YOU NEED 
TO KNOW HOW YOU LOOK 
BY WHAT DOES 
A PROFESSIONAL IMAGE GURU MAKE OF 
IT I MADE JENNIFER SIT IN MY CAR 
AMONG THE PUSHCHAIR SPARE NAPPIES 
AND BABY WIPES 
HIS IT IS CERTAINLY 
A SAFER OPTION THAN GLIMPSING YOUR 
REFLECTION IN A SHOP WINDOW AS YOU 
DRIVE PAST L. AM CONCERNED OF WOMEN 
WILL BE RUSHING OUT TO THEIR CARS 
WITH A BIT MIRROR ASKING IS MY 
BUMPER BIG IN THIS YOU TO USE YOUR 
CAR FOR PHYSICAL FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL 
REASONS I CAN'T SAY YOU WOULD 
CHOOSE A CAR TO FIT YOU BECAUSE YOU 
DON'T HAVE TO WEAR IT YOU'RE NEVER 
HAD A CAR WHICH DOESN'T FIT TO 
PROPERLY IT IS A PERSONALITY 
CHOICE 
DOES IT MATTER WHAT YOU CHOICE LOOK LIKE IN A CAR L. AM STICKING 
TO MY RUNAROUND I HAVE GIVEN IT A 
CLEAN AND IT HAS COME OUT REALLY 
NICELY 
FROM A FERRARI TO A TRIUMPH I AM 
DRIVING THIS WITH BRIAN DO YOU 
THINK THIS CAR SUITS YOU COULD NOT 
BE IT SUITS ME VERY WELL WHAT 
ABOUT THE IDEA OF TRYING ON A CAR 
WOULD YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR 
TRYING ON A CAR WOULD BE THE LAST 
THING I WOULD DO 
IF YOU NEVER LOOK 
AT YOUR FLEXION IN A SHOP WINDOW 
YOU WOULD NEVER LET US TALK TO 
ANOTHER BRIAN IN HIS RELIANT 
OBVIOUSLY THESE CARS HAVE A 
REPUTATION SOME PEOPLE ARE 
DISPARAGING WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT 
YOU 
IT IS FINE IT IS A BIT OF FUN YOU DRIVING IT ABOUT IT ATTRACTS A LOT 
OF ATTENTION IT'S A GREAT LITTLE 
VEHICLE 
IT IS A CLASSIC IT HAS VEHICLE LASTED A LOT LONGER THAN OTHER 
CARS TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD 
WHAT YOU THINK 
ABOUT GOING INTO A CAR SHOWROOM TO 
TRY A CAR ON 
I WOULDN'T KNOW MUCH 
ABOUT THAT I JUST PREFER THIS DO DO YOU CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HOW YOU LOOK 
IN A SHOP WINDOW 
I DO SOMETIMES 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE TO MARK 
SOMETIMES IT FEELS BIT FUNNY 
BEING IN A RELIANT 
BUT YOU STILL 
LOVE IT 
LET US GIVE IT A GO YOU CAN SEE 
HOW IT SUITS US GOODBYE THERE HE GOES LOOKING CALL COOL 
LET US SHOW YOU SOME AMAZING 
PICTURES OF FREEDIVER JULIA PETRIK 
WHO HITCHED A RIDE ON THE BACK OF A 
BELUGA WELL IN THE WHITE SEA IN 
RUSSIA THEY WERE TAKEN BY 
SPECIALIST PHOTOGRAPHER DAN BURTON 
WE WILL BE TALKING TO HIM IN A 
MOMENT FIRST LET'S SEE HIM 
GETTING UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WITH 
THE WHALES 
DAN IS ABOUT TO DIVE WITH THE 
BELUGAS FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME 
THE WHALES ARE GENTLE CREATURES 
THEY CAN BE BIGGER THOUGH WEIGHING 
UP TO ONE TON 
BUT WAIT LESS IN THE WATER BOTH 
WHALES AND DIVERS APPEAR 
EXTRAORDINARILY GRACEFUL 
WEIGHTLESS 
IT IS AMAZING SOME OF WEIGHTLESS THESE ANIMALS ARE SO BIG AND THEY 
GRABBED HOLD OF YOUR LEAD WITH 
THEIR MOUTH YOU PUT IT OUT BUT 
THEY ARE JUST PLAIN JUST TOUCHING 
AND FEELING YOU 
THEY ARE THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY 
IMAGES THEY ARE WHITE THAT 
STRANGE WHITE AN EXTRAORDINARY 
COLOUR 
TO MY KNOWLEDGE THEY ARE COLOUR THE ONLY WHITE WHALE OUT THERE IN 
THE WORLD THEY LIVE IN MOST 
NORTHERN REGIONS OF THE WORLD IN 
THE ARCTIC WATERS 
QUITE EERIE 
THOSE IMAGES 
YES WE ARE IN SUB 
ZERO WATER TEMPERATURES MINUS TWO 
THE WHITE SEA IS ONE OF THE COLDEST 
IN THE WORLD AND THE AIR IS MINUS 
FIFTEEN IN ONE OF THE MOST REMOTE 
PLACES IN NORTHERN RUSSIA SEEING 
THESE WHALES 
WE ARE CONCERNED THEY 
WERE TAKING IN LEVEL 
IT WAS WHEN 
HE GRABBED HOLD OF MY LEG TAKING 
A NIBBLE THE LOCALS SAID JUST SIT 
THERE AND HE WILL LET GO HE DID IT 
A COUPLE OF TIMES AND AFTER THAT 
IT WAS FINE 
SOMEONE GOT IN TOUCH WITH US 
QUESTIONING THE MERITS OF SWIMMING 
WITH WHALES AND CONTACT WITH THEM 
LIKE THAT WHAT IS THE VIEW ON 
THAT 
THESE WELSH MACRO THEY HAD THAT BEEN ON A CATCHER RELEASE PROGRAMME 
FROM THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT 
WHALES THEY HAVE BEEN RELEASED 
FROM A BIG TANK AND THEY HAVE BEEN 
PUT BACK INTO THE SEA THESE 
ANIMALS ARE VERY USED TO DIVERS TO 
PEOPLE HAVING CONTACT WITH THEM 
IN THE WILD I DON'T AGREE WITH IT 
BUT THESE ANIMALS THEY WANT TO 
PLAY WITH YOU IF THEY DID NOT 
THEY WOULD SWIM AWAY IN THE WILD 
I DON'T AGREE WITH IT 
TO YOU HAVE 
TO BREAK UP AND THE ICE TO GET IN 
THIS PLACE HAD A HUGE ICED LAGOON 
TEN METRES SQUARE WHICH THE WHALES 
KEEP OPEN THEMSELVES THEY HAD A 
BULGE ON THEN THOSE WHERE THEY CAN 
SMASH THE ICE IN OTHER PLACES WE 
HAD TO CUT A HOLE IN THE ICE USING 
A BIT SORE 
THE FREEDIVER YOU ARE 
WORKING WITH HOW LONG CAN YOU 
STATE IN THE WATER AT THAT 
TEMPERATURE 
JULIA PETRIK IS A TEMPERATURE RUSSIAN FREEDIVER ONE OF THE TOP 
ONES WE WERE IN THEIR WEARING WET 
SUITS AND THE IDEA WAS WE COULD 
STAY IN AND SWIM AT EASE WITH THE 
WHALES RATHER THAN WEARING THE 
CONVENTIONAL SCUBA WHICH IS CLUMSY 
WE WERE IN THE WATER FOR UP TO ONE 
HOUR AT A TIME DIVING DOWN TO FIFTEEN 
METRES WITH THE WHALES 
THE HOW 
COLD WERE YOU DID YOU COME AT 
AGONISING THE FROZEN 
THE WATER IS 
WARMER THAN OUTSIDE MINUS TWO IN 
THE WATER WHEN I CAME OUT I HAD TO 
PUT A COLD ON JUMPED INTO THE 
SNOWMOBILE AND TEN MINUTES LATER I 
WAS IN A WARM CABIN 
THE SOUND 
WHAT WAS IT LIKE WHEN YOU'RE 
SWIMMING WE IT IS AMAZING HOW 
NOISY IT IS G. IS NORMALLY A 
VERY QUIET ACTIVITY THERE IS AN 
AMBIENCE OF SOUND IN THE WATER 
WITH THE WHALES THEY WERE 
COMMUNICATING KICKING AND 
WHISTLING PROBABLY TALKING ABOUT 
US ISN'T HE COME SEE HE'S NOT 
VERY GOOD IN THE WATER CLUMSY 
YOU CAN WATCH THAT OLD TRICK ON

WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WAFFLING 
NOW DON'T YOU HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE 
WASTING YOUR TIME WITH PHRASES LIKE 
AT THE END OF THE DAY DO YOU KNOW 
WHAT I MEAN IT SEEMS MORE OF US 
ARE WASTING WORDS IN EVERYDAY 
CONVERSATIONS AND TAKING AN AGE TO 
GET TO THE POINT BUT WE ARE NEVER 
GUILTY OF THAT LET US HAVE LOOK 
AT SOME CEREAL CULPRITS 
IF THE D. E. C. BE ON TELLY LAST NIGHT 
ON THE TELEVISION 
YEAH MAN SHE 
IS WELL FIT 
THAT WAS A WELL NICE 
SONG 
YEAH SHE 
IS FIT AS WELL SHE SONG SHE IS BETTER NOW SHE HAS READ LEFT 
THE BAND 
BUT SHE 
IS WELL SET SHE SHE IS WELL BING WHAT YOU MEAN 
IT IS 
BLING THAT IS BAD 
A I AM NOT

ARE YOU 
DISRESPECTED ME 
NO I AM NOT WAIT WAIT A MINUTE I AM NOT DISRESPECT IN 
YOU JUST CHILL OUT 
WE ARE GOING TO TRY NOT TO WAFFLE 
IS IT AN ART WAFFLING OR IS IT 
BAD THING 
I THINK IT IS QUITE 
CLEVER PEOPLE USE IT AS AN EVASIVE 
THING NOT TO ANSWER A QUESTION 
WHICH IS WHAT I AM DOING NOW YES 
IT WAS HAROLD WILSON HE STARTED 
SAYING AT THE END OF THE DAY HE 
INVENTED THAT TO GIVE HIM TIME TO 
THINK OF AN ANSWER IT IS NOT 
REALLY POLITICIANS DO IT REALLY 
WELL IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE THAT 
PEOPLE MAKE UP THINGS AS THEY GO 
ALONG 
THE LIST OF THE WORDS THE ALONG WORST OFFENDERS ACTUALLY 
BASICALLY LIKE OF COURSE DO YOU 
HAVE AN ALARM IN YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU 
HEAR STOP USING THEM COULD TO MARK 
THIS IS THE WORST JOB I HAD BEEN 
ASKED TO DO 
I SAID I WAS GOING TO 
COME ON TO TALK ABOUT WAFFLING AND 
PEOPLE SAID I WONDER WHY THEY 
ASKED YOU DEWAR WENT REMEMBER 
THE WONDERFUL GRAHAM CHAPMAN SKETCH 
HE TALKED ABOUT THE WELL BASICALLY 
CLUB AND HE SAID WHAT IS THE WELL 
BASICALLY CLUB AND HE SAID WELL 
BASICALLY I THINK IT IS BECAUSE 
PEOPLE SPEAK BEFORE THEY THINK 
THAT IS WHAT I DO L. L. KIND OF 
WHEN I WANT TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING 
I START ABOUT SEVEN THOUGHTS AT 
ONCE 
IT IS BETTER THAN SAYING ONCE NOTHING IF YOU ARE BUYING TIME 
THE WORD ACTUALLY MEANS YOU ARE 
BUYING TIME IN YOUR OWN HEAD TO SAY 
SOMETHING ISN'T THAT O. K. BUT BUT PEOPLE DO SAY I AM ACTUALLY EATING 
AS OPPOSED TO VIRTUALLY OR IN A 
PARALLEL WORLD 
THESE PAPERS ARE 
NEWSPAPERS ARE CLEVER AT INVENTING 
WORDS THE DICTIONARY IS PRUNED 
FULL OF SUPERFLUOUS WORDS 
NEWSPAPERS ALWAYS REFER TO JOBS 
BEING AXED MY UNCLE GOT AXED FROM 
HIS JOB LAST WEEK 
YES WE ARE 
GOING TO PUT THE TOPS WITH A 
BABYSITTER TOTS 
THE CLIP MADE 
IT VERY FUNNY BUT THAT HAS LED TO 
WORDS BEING USED FOR BECAUSE KIDS 
A LOT OF PEOPLE IMITATE THOSE 
SCENES THEY DO DON'T THEY 
REPETITION IS DIFFERENT IF YOU 
THINK OF THAT KIND OF REPETITION 
IT IS BECAUSE SHE HASN'T GOT 
ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY IF YOU THINK 
OF THE MARTIN LUTHER KING SPEECH 
THAT KIND OF REPETITION BECOMES 
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL THE DID YOU 
JUST USE THE WORD ACTUALLY TWICE 
WELL SPOTTED 
AND SHE SAID I HAVE 
TO SAY 
YOU KNOW I JUST HAVE TO SAY 
TEN PER CENT OF THE CONVERSATIONS ARE WASTED 
THEY ARE NOT WASTED THEY ARE 
CONVERSATIONS IT DOESN'T MATTER 
DOES IT 
I KNOW BUT SOMETIMES IF 
YOU ARE SITTING ON A BUS AND YOU 
HEAR A COUPLE OF KIDS TALKING IT 
IS PAINFUL YOU SOMETIMES WONDER 
WHEN M. I SIX HAVE TO BUGGED PHONE CALLS 
HOW BORED THEY MUST GET 
WHAT I 
LOVE ON BUSS IS SOME PEOPLE SPEAK 
WITH GREAT ECONOMY L. REMEMBER A THIRTY EIGHT 
IN LONDON AND TWO LARGE WOMEN WERE 
SITTING ACROSS EACH OTHER AND IT 
WAS LIKE A PINTER PLAY THEY WENT 
HELLO IT WENT ON THAT'S ALL 
THEY DID ONE WORD AT A TIME WITH 
BIG GAPS ONE OF THEM HAD A TIN ON 
HER LAP AND ONE OF THEM WENT 
SPONGE AND SHE WENT YEAH 
SPONGE AS WE TURNED THE CORNER 
ONE WOMAN WENT GENERAL DE GAULLE 
LIKED SPONGE I PROMISE YOU IT IS 
TRUE IT WAS WONDERFUL

LENGTH OF TIME

FIND OUT HOW TO TAKE PART BUT HERE 
IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW GOOD CHOIRS IN 
THIS COUNTRY CAN BE 
COMING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN

ROUND I'M SURE THERE IS ONE 
CHAP IN THE BACK THERE BARELY 
SINGING IT DIDN'T MATTER YOU

THE FOUNDER AND PRINCIPAL FROM THE 
VOICES FOUNDATION YOU ARE GOING TO 
BE A JUDGE INTERESTING WATCHING 
PEOPLE SING THIS PROGRAMME IS ALL 
ABOUT CELEBRATING PEOPLE SINGING TO 
THE 
ABSOLUTELY WE WANT TO GET THE THE WHOLE COUNTRY SINGING WE ARE 
TRYING TO ENCOURAGE ALL CHOIRS TO 
JOIN WHETHER IT IS A FANTASTIC 
CATHEDRAL CHOIR OR A GROUP OF 
FISHERMEN WHO MEET REGULARLY IN THE 
PUB TO SING WE WANT TO CELEBRATE 
THAT DIVERSITY 
DO PEOPLE DO THAT 
ARE THERE THAT MANY PEOPLE IN THE 
COUNTRY TO GET TOGETHER TO SING AS 
GROUPS 
YES AND IT IS INCREASING GROUPS THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT IS 
GOING TOP CAPTURE THE PUBLIC 
IMAGINATION THERE IS A HUGE 
INTEREST IN SINGING YOU CAN 
EXPRESS A COMMON EMOTION THROUGH 
SINGING IT IS A WONDERFUL 
WONDERFUL WAY TO HELP HEALTHY AND 
TO SOCIALISE 
WHAT ARE THE RULES 
ABOUT WHO CAN QUALIFY IF THERE IS 
YOU AND FIVE MATES WHO SOMETIMES 
START SINGING IN THE PUB OF AN 
EVENING 
ANYONE FROM TOP NOTCH EVENING CATHEDRAL CHOIRS TO A GROUP OF 
FRIENDS O. WHO GET TOGETHER TO SING 
TO BARBERSHOP TO GOSPEL TO JAZZ 
CHOIRS CLASSICAL CHOIRS THE WORKS 
HOW MANY PEOPLE CONSTITUTES A 
CHOIR 
BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTY 
YOU HAVE CHOIR TO HAVE AT LEAST TEN 
AT LEAST TEN 
OTHERWISE IT IS NOT REALLY A CHOIR 
I LOVED WHAT WE SAW THE OLDER 
LADIES SHALL WE SAY TAKING ON 
REAL CURRENT SONGS WHICH IS 
FANTASTIC WASN'T IT 
THAT'S RIGHT 
I MEAN THE GREAT THING ABOUT 
SINGING THE TO YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
BE BRILLIANT TO SING IN A CHOIR TO 
EXPERIENCE AN AMAZING MUSICAL 
EXPERIENCE AND SO IT IS JUST A 
FANTASTIC FEEL GOOD 
NOW SUZI VERY 
KEEN ON THE WHOLE SINGING THING 
BUT YOU WILL BE AWARE IN TELEVISION 
TERMS OFTEN THERE IS A HORRIBLE 
FASCINATION WITH PEOPLE WHO DO 
THINGS BADLY IN THE EARLY STAGES 
OF TRYING TO FIND CHOIRS YOU MIGHT 
WELL FIND REALLY BAD ONES IS IT 
THAT KIND OF SHOW ARE YOU GOING TO 
SHOW THE AUDITION PROCESS AND 
PEOPLE WHO ARE RUBBISH 
WE ARE BUT 
THE SPIRIT OF THE SHOW IS THAT WE 
WANT TO ENCOURAGE L. MEAN THIS IS 
THE ULTIMATE AIM WHAT I HAVE 
DEVOTED MY LIFE TO TO ENCOURAGE 
PEOPLE AND ANYONE WHO COMES 
FORWARD THEY WILL HAVE A FANTASTIC 
TIME BEING PART OF IT THERE IS 
NONE OF THAT SHAMING AND 
EMBARRASSING IT REALLY IS A 
CELEBRATION OF THIS WONDERFUL PART 
OF OUR COMMUNITY 
I KNOW IT IS 
GOING TO BE A HUGE GENERALISATION 
BUT IN A CHOIR IS THERE NORMALLY 
SOMEBODY WHO IS IN CHARGE AND HOW 
MUCH DOES IT DEPEND HOW GOOD YOU 
ARE ON THAT PERSON 
IT IS A VERY 
INTERESTING QUESTION THE DIRECTOR 
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT GENRE IT IS 
BUT THE DIRECTOR IS CRUCIAL REALLY 
REALLY IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE 
OF THE CHANNEL THEY ARE THE ONE 
UPFRONT WHO IS INSPIRING THE 
SINGERS AND CHOOSING THE REPERTOIRE 
AND SUCH IN SOME OF THE SMALLER 
GROUPS YOU WOULD GET MORE OF A 
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS 
IS THERE 
NORMALLY ONE BEING CARRIED CAN YOU 
NORMALLY SPOT THAT THAT ONE IS NOT 
QUITE THERE 
YES THAT HAS BEEN 
KNOWN TO HAPPEN 
BRILLIANT AND 
THERE IS STILL TIME TO APPLY 
IT IS 
VITAL WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME 
FORWARD WHOEVER YOU ARE WHETHER 
YOU ARE A CLASSICAL CHOIR OR A 
SMALL GROUP OF SINGERS PLEASE
