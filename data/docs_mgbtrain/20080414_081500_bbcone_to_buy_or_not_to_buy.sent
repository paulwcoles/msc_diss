WE'VE LANDED HERE IN EAST SUSSEX ON THE LOOKOUT FOR A HIDEAWAY FOR A COUPLE 
LOOKING FOR AN ESCAPE FROM THE CUT AND THRUST LIFE OF CITY LIVING 
AND WE'VE GOT TO JUST FORTY EIGHT HOURS TO IDENTIFY OUR TARGET AND GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO TRY 
BEFORE THEY BUY 
WE'LL BE BACK 
KRIS WHAT WE DOING IN THIS CLOBBER 
WE'RE HERE TO MEET THE TERMINATOR 
ARNIE WELL NO HIS NAME'S ACTUALLY PETER 
BUT HE'S STILL A TERMINATOR AND HIS MISSION IS TO EXTERMINATE ANY VERMIN THAT MAY GET IN HIS PATH

IT'S GREENWICH COUNTY COUNCIL HE'S A PEST CONTROLLER AND HE KILLS VERMIN A COOL JOB 
SQUASHES BUGS BEETLES THAT SORT OF THING THAT'S RIGHT COOL LET'S GO MEET HIM O. K. 
PETER AND ALYSSA MACAULAY HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR A NEW HOME FOR OVER TWO YEARS 
PETER IS A PEST CONTROLLER AND ALYSSA IS A SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR 
FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS THEY'VE LIVED IN THIS TOWN HOUSE IN LONDON OVERLOOKING GREENWICH PARK 
BUT NOW THEY WANT TO ESCAPE THE RAT RACE OF CITY LIVING AND RELOCATE TO THE COUNTRY 
SO IT'S HASTA LA VISTA GREENWICH AND BIENVENIDO SUSSEX 
I THINK IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT PRECISELY WHAT OUR MISSION INVOLVES 
SO PETER AND ALYSSA HERE WE ARE IN A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY PUB 
FIRE ROARING AWAY YOU CURRENTLY LIVE IN GREENWICH WHY DO YOU WANT TO LIVE IN THIS AREA 
WELL WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEWHERE THAT'S NICE AND PEACEFUL 
COUNTRY PURSUITS AND PERHAPS SOMEWHERE FOR ALYSSA TO KEEP CHICKENS 
THERE'S NOWHERE IN LONDON YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THAT WE'RE NOT GIVE US AN IDEA WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR 
I'M LOOKING FOR A PERIOD PROPERTY 
TWO TO THREE BEDROOMS SOMEWHERE WE CAN RELAX UNWIND SIT IN FRONT OF THE FIRE FAIR ENOUGH 
PETER WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU 
FOR ME I'D LOVE AN INGLENOOK FIREPLACE 
LIKE WE HAVE HERE NOT THAT SIZE I HOPE 
HE'S GOT FIRE ENVY GOING ON 
DO WE DO MOCK DO WE DO FAUX 
WE DON'T DO MOCK WE DON'T DO FAUX 
YOU MIGHT DO BUT WE DON'T IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL GET 
YOU WON'T FIND A LOT OF MOCK IN THIS AREA YOU'RE ALWAYS MOCKING ME 
WELL I'VE GOT THE AMMUNITION FAIR ENOUGH 
LET'S ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT WORK ON THE BUILDING 
WOULD YOU UNDERTAKE ANYTHING STRUCTURAL OR DECORATING OR NOT AT ALL 
YES I'M PREPARED TO TO DO MINOR ALTERATIONS 
MAYBE KNOCK THE ODD WALL DOWN TO MAKE A ROOM BIGGER 
BUT NOTHING REALLY STRUCTURAL WHERE WE HAVE TO RAISE THE FLOOR 
I THINK KNOCKING WALLS DOWN IS QUITE MAJOR 
WELL YOU SAY THAT BUT I CAN SEE BEYOND THAT 
IF IT NEEDS A WALL KNOCKED DOWN HE'S NOT TOO SCARED YEAH YOU'RE OPEN MINDED WHICH IS GOOD 
SHALL I ASK THE BIG QUESTION DOM GO ON THEN KRIS SHALL I ASK IT WHAT IS YOUR BUDGET 
OUR BUDGET IS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UP TO APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
RIGHT O. K. DOMINIC AND I WILL DO OUR UTMOST TO TO MAKE SURE WE FIND YOU THREE VERY INTERESTING PROPERTIES 
WE'LL HOOK UP WITH YOU LATER ON AND SEE WHAT YOU MAKE OF THEM GREAT 
KRIS THAT DON'T SEEM TOO BAD GOT A HEALTHY BUDGET 
THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO OR THREE BEDROOMS CHARACTER PROPERTY 
SOMEWHERE TO GROW VEGETABLES AND RAISE CHICKENS CAN WE FIND A HOME FOR OUR TERMINATOR 
MY TERMINATOR VISION HAS SPOTTED SOMETHING 
I'M NOT TELLING YOU WHAT IT IS 
BUT I'VE SEEN SOMETHING I'LL BE SEEING YOU LATER ON ALL RIGHT I'LL CHECK OUT THE AGENCY 
MY NAME'S DOMINIC 
IF YOU WERE GOING TO BUY A HOUSE 
WHERE WOULD YOU BE LOOKING AROUND THIS AREA I WOULDN'T KNOW I'M FROM SOUTH AFRICA 
THIS IS A LONG COMMUTE FROM SOUTH AFRICA 
THEY'VE GOT THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
SO QUITE A GOOD BUDGET THE CHARACTER IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT 
WHERE ARE THE NICE VILLAGES 
THIS IS A VERY GOOD VILLAGE INDEED BUT THE PRICES ARE PRETTY HIGH THIS IS WHAT I AM DISCOVERING YES 
THEY WANT THE HIGH WEALD AREA WHICH IS QUITE A BROAD AREA AROUND HERE 
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY WHERE WE ARE 
WHAT VILLAGES ROUND HERE WOULD YOU RECOMMEND WADHURST EVERYONE IS SAYING WADHURST 
IF YOU ARE WILLING TO BE A LITTLE BIT 
FLEXIBLE IN TERMS OF WHAT SORT OF PROPERTY YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF HOW WELL IT'S FINISHED 
OR WHETHER IT IS IT IS A WRECK THEN YOU'LL FIND WHAT YOU WANT 
ONE OF THE FANTASTIC THINGS 
WHEN I'M ON THIS CRUSADE TO FIND THIS PERFECT RURAL IDYLL FOR ALYSSA AND PETER 
IS THE FACT KENT IS FULL OF THE MOST FANTASTIC OLDE WORLDE VILLAGES 
AND THE MOST RIDICULOUS NAMES YOU HAVE EVER HEARD OF 
CAN YOU IMAGINE GETTING POST IN THE MORNING ADDRESSED TO THE VILLAGE 
OF BADGERS' MOUNT PRATT'S BOTTOM OR EVEN DANIEL'S WATER 
THAT'S CERTAINLY FOOD FOR THOUGHT ISN'T IT 
THE HIGH WEALD IS AN AREA OF OUTSTANDING NATURAL BEAUTY 
IT MAY ONLY BE BE AN HOUR FROM LONDON BUT IT FEELS A MILLION MILES AWAY 
THE REGION IS MAINLY MADE UP OF SMALL PRETTY VILLAGES 
WEALD MEANS FOREST OR WILDERNESS 
AND THIS AREA STILL RETAINS THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF ANCIENT WOODLAND IN THE COUNTRY 
HISTORICALLY EAST SUSSEX WAS KNOWN FOR ITS IRON INDUSTRY PARTICULARLY IN THE PRODUCTION OF CANNONS 
BUT ITS ALSO FAMOUS FOR THE GROWING AND DRYING OF BEER HOPS 
ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE OLD OAST HOUSES HAVE NOW BEEN CONVERTED INTO FAMILY HOMES 
THE NEXT ONE I HAVE GOT IS ONE THAT IS COMPLETELY DETACHED 
IT'S WITHIN THE BUDGET 
BUT IT DEPENDS HOW MUCH WORK THEY WANT TO DO TO IT THAT IS A REAL HONEY OF A HOUSE 
IT'S A REAL CHARACTER COTTAGE 
I'VE GOT TO BE TRUTHFUL BOTH OF THESE LOOK PERFECT IN THEIR OWN RIGHT 
THIS ONE IS A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THAT ONE BUT THEN THAT NEEDS THE WORK 
WHAT WOULD BE MY CHANCES OF VIEWING THESE THIS MORNING NO PROBLEM WE'VE GOT KEYS TO BOTH 
LOVELY ONE IS EMPTY THE OTHER ONE THE LADY'S AT WORK 
SO I CAN TAKE YOU ROUND WHENEVER YOU LIKE 
THERE'S NO PRIZES FOR GUESSING WHICH ONE'S THE EMPTY ONE EXACTLY 
OBVIOUSLY HOMES IN SUSSEX CARRY A PREMIUM PRICE TAG 
BUT WHAT CAN YOU GET ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY 
WELL IN NORWICH THERE'S THIS FOUR RECEPTION 
FOUR BED DETACHED FOR THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
FOR THE SAME PRICE IN NORTHUMBERLAND YOU COULD BUY THIS 
REFURBISHED FOUR BED HOME IN A VILLAGE LOCATION 
IF YOU'RE MORE OF A TOWNIE 
THIS THREE STOREY HOUSE IN BRISTOL COMES IN JUST UNDER BUDGET 
KRIS AND I HAVE BEEN BUSY LITTLE BEES OUT HERE 
AND I'VE COME UP WITH A WINNER WHICH I'M CHOOSING AS MY FAVOURITE 
IT IS BEAUTIFUL MAYBE A LITTLE BIT SMALL BUT WE'LL FIND OUT 
WHAT IS ME OR THAT THE HOUSE THAT SO NICE OF YOU BECAUSE NORMALLY IT'S A DIG AT ME 
NO NOT AT ALL BUT THERE'LL BE SOME SERIOUS JUDGMENT DAY WHEN THEY SEE MY PROPERTY THIS IS A PEACOCK 
ITS INTERIOR DECOR IS DIVINE 
IT'S NOTHING LIKE A PEACOCK NO NO LOOK AT THE INTERIOR 
O. K. LET'S GO WITH THAT WILD CARD BECAUSE YOU'RE IN FOR A SHOCK IF YOU SEE THIS 
THAT IS THE BIGGEST UNDERSTATEMENT IT'S A VERY WILD PROPERTY THAT'S ALL THREE OF THEM 
IT'S TIME NOW TO COMMENCE THE VIEWINGS 
FIRST UP IT'S MY CHOICE 
CHERRY TREE COTTAGE IN THE VILLAGE OF FLIMWELL 
THIS IS AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY DETACHED PROPERTY 
WITH A GOOD SIZED SOUTH FACING GARDEN FOR PETER TO ENJOY HIS NEW FOUND HOBBY 
IT ALSO HAS TWO BEDROOMS AND I'M SURE THE COUPLE WILL FALL IN LOVE 
WITH THE CHARACTER AS IT HAS A WEALTH OF ORIGINAL FEATURES 
I'VE GOT TO SAY PETER AND ALYSSA WHAT A WONDERFUL DAY FOR LOOKING AT COUNTRY COTTAGES AND GARDENS 
AND GARDENS OF COURSE YEAH 
AND HAS JUST GETS BETTER BECAUSE HERE WE ARE AT MY CHOSEN FAVOURITE 
YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO CHARM AND CHARACTER 
THIS IS AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY COTTAGE AND I'VE DELIVERED THAT IN AN ABUNDANCE 
EXPOSED BRICKWORK EXPOSED BEAMS 
IN FACT EVERYTHING YOU SAID YOU WANTED I'VE GOT 
FANTASTIC YEAH I LIKE THAT START 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ALYSSA IT'S FANTASTIC 
OOH TWO FANTASTICS 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL ISN'T IT ANY CONCERNS 
THE MAIN ROAD IT'S A LITTLE BIT NOISY MAIN ROAD LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THAT 
LET'S FOCUS ON WHAT DOMINIC'S FOUND ONE THING I WANT TO FLAG UP 
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR GARDEN OF ENGLAND 
THE GARDEN OF ENGLAND HAS GOT A VERY LARGE PRICE TAG 
YOU KNOW YOU WANT A LARGE GARDEN LET'S KEEP IT MODEST ALL RIGHT 
LET'S KEEP THE WHOLE THING MODEST VERY CUTE HAVE A LOOK AROUND 
SEE WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT GO ON HAVE SOME FUN O. K. THANK YOU 
MODESTLY CUTE SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE DESCRIBING ME THERE 
JUST NOT THE MODEST BIT 
WOW 
RIGHT DOM HEADPHONES ON AND LET'S SEE WHAT THEY MAKE OF YOUR CHOICE 
I LIKE THE OAK BEAMS 
NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THIS STAIRCASE 
IT KIND OF JUMPS OUT AT YOU WHEN YOU WALK IN 
WHAT'S JUMPING OUT SOMETHING 
THEY'VE GOT AN OPEN FIREPLACE 
YES I GUESS IT'S A WORKING FIREPLACE 
NICE AND COSY IN THE WINTER 
IT'S A BIT SMALL ISN'T IT 
IT'S A BIT ENCLOSING 
BUT I LIKE THE FEEL OF IT 
I'M WONDERING WHETHER IT'D A BETTER SPACE IF YOU KNOCKED THIS WALL DOWN 
HAVE A THROUGH LOUNGE GIVE A BIT MORE SPACE 
PRETEND WE DIDN'T HEAR THAT IT'S A BIT TOO 
CLOSED IN M. M. M. 
HE'S LOOKING AT AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY COTTAGE HE SAID KNOCK A WALL DOWN 
OH YES 
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN 
THIS IS QUITE SMALL AS WELL 
BUT TWO FIREPLACES YOU COULD IMAGINE IF WE KNOCK THAT WALL DOWN 
YOU'D GET THE THROUGH LOUNGE HAVE A FIRE GOING OVER THERE AND THERE IT'D BE LOVELY AND COSY 
YOU COULD SIT IN A SETTEE THERE AND I COULD SIT IN ONE THERE 
WHY DON'T THEY SIT IN THE SAME SETTEE AND LEAVE THE WALL UP YEAH WORKS FOR US 
QUITE LIKE THE FEEL 
BUT THIS WALL WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE TO COME DOWN 
WE OUGHT HAVE GOT THEM JUST A BUILDING PLOT 
YOU'RE WAITING FOR YOUR GIN AND TONIC I'M WAITING FOR MY GIN AND TONIC 
LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE KITCHEN 
O. K. 
WELL IT'S GOT EVERYTHING YOU NEED 
LOTS OF CUPBOARD SPACE 
I THINK IT'S WELL SET OUT FOR THE SIZE OF THE KITCHEN LOTS OF CUPBOARD SPACE 
INTEGRATED APPLIANCES 
I FOUND THE GIN YES YOU FOUND THE GIN 
OH 
WOW LOOK AT THAT I LIKE THAT 
THAT'S THE OLD FASHIONED TIMBERS 
THAT'S GREAT 
IT'S A GREAT ROOM IT'S NOT LAID OUT AS A BEDROOM 
SO IT COULD BE AN OFFICE 
IT COULD BE A GUEST BEDROOM BUT WHAT A FANTASTIC FEELING OF SPACE 
THIS IS THE BATHROOM I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'VE GOT A BATHROOM UPSTAIRS 
DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S WHAT WE WANT 
I LIKE THE COLOUR SCHEME THOUGH WORKS WELL NEUTRAL 
BUT I PREFER THE BATHROOM UPSTAIRS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UPSTAIRS YET DO WE 
WELL WE SHOULD GO AND FIND OUT 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SURPRISED HE HASN'T MENTIONED 
GO ON THEN BECAUSE OF HIS JOB I'M SURPRISED HE HASN'T BEEN LOOKING FOR WOODWORM HE CAN KILL 
HE HAS HE'S BEEN MAKING A MENTAL NOTE 
HE'S BEEN GOING THE ONLY PEST ROUND HERE IS THAT DIGBY 
HERE WE ARE 
IT'S A NICE SIZED BEDROOM 
THIS IS THE MASTER OR THE SECOND I'M NOT SURE TILL WE GO TO THE OTHER ONE 
NICE LITTLE FEATURE HERE WOW LOOK AT THIS EN SUITE 
WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO FAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 
THIS IS THE OTHER BEDROOM 
THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM BY THE LOOKS OF IT 
I LIKE THIS ONE COSY 
I LIKE THE FIREPLACE FEATURE THAT'S A GOOD FEATURE 
YES THEY'VE BONDED WITH THE FIREPLACE ALWAYS VERY GOOD 
YES I LIKE THE FEEL OF IT 
I'M STILL GETTING THESE NAGGING DOUBTS ABOUT THIS MAIN ROAD THOUGH AND ALL THE TRAFFIC YOU KNOW 
LET'S LOOK AT FACTS HERE THERE'S TWO BIG NEGATIVE POINTS FOR THEM 
THE ROAD NOISE THE STAIRCASE WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THOSE LET'S DISCUSS IT COME ON 
ALYSSA I WENT WEAK AT THE KNEES WHEN I HEARD YOU OUT THERE WHY 
YOU COME INTO THIS LOVELY COTTAGE IT'S TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS OLD AND YOU SAID 
I WANT TO KNOCK THAT WALL DOWN 
A WALL YES BUT AS YOU WALK IN YOU SEE A WALL AND A STAIRWAY AND THEY BOTH HIT YOU IN THE FACE 
I WANT TO WALK IN AND SEE SPACE 
THIS IS AN EYESORE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT ABSOLUTELY 
I'VE GOT A SUGGESTION FOR THAT BUT AS FOR THIS PETER SAID 
IS IT LOAD BEARING THIS IS AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY COTTAGE 
EVERY ONE OF THESE WALLS ARE LOAD BEARING 
THESE ARE NOT DECORATIVE THAT IS SUPPORTING EVERYTHING RIGHT UP TO THE ROOF THERE 
I KNOW THEY'RE SMALL ROOMS BUT THAT'S A COTTAGE FOR YOU 
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE 
THE DOOR'S THERE YOU HAVE THIS EYESORE THIS IS A RANCH STYLE STAIRCASE 
ISN'T IN THE CHARACTER OF THIS PROPERTY WHAT ABOUT IF YOU GOT IN A NICE STAIRCASE A SPIRAL ONE 
PERHAPS WROUGHT IRON WROUGHT IRON 
IT WOULD LOOK ABSOLUTELY LOVELY 
OR IF YOU DON'T LIKE LIKE SPIRALS GET IN A STAIRCASE WHICH WILL KEEP IN CHARACTER WITH THE BUILDING 
IT WOULDN'T COST YOU A FORTUNE 
YOU'RE NOT ALTERING THE MAIN STRUCTURE OF THE COTTAGE BUT I TELL YOU WHAT IT'D HALF IMPROVE IT 
SO PETER ONE OF THE THINGS YOU WEREN'T TOO KEEN ON WAS THE ROAD 
THE ROAD O. K. HAS IT REALLY PUT YOU OFF 
I BELIEVE SO 
IT'S NOT JUST THE NOISE FACTOR BUT WE HAVE NEPHEWS AND NIECES COME TO STAY 
AND I THINK IT'S A BIT UNSAFE IF THEY COME RUNNING OUT STRAIGHT ONTO THE ROAD 
WELL THIS ROAD IS QUITE BUSY AT THE MOMENT 
BECAUSE IT LEADS ON TO A VERY BUSY A ROAD THAT GOES STRAIGHT INTO LONDON 
HOWEVER DO YOU WANT SOME GOOD NEWS 
I WOULD WELL IT'S RUMOURED THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A BYPASS 
REALLY BUILT IN THE NEXT YEAR 
THIS THEREFORE WILL BECOME DEAD NOBODY WILL BE USING THIS AT ALL 
YOU WILL HAVE YOUR LITTLE QUIET IDYLL BACK 
OF COURSE YOU'VE GOT THE GATE ANYWAY FOR SECURITY YES 
AND EVEN IN THE YEAR BUILD UP TO THE BYPASS BEING BUILT YOU'VE GOT THE SECONDARY GLAZING ANYWAY 
ABSOLUTELY SO YOU CAN GET IN EARLY WHEN THIS IS MAYBE PUTTING PEOPLE OFF 
AND YOUR HOUSE PRICE IS GOING TO DO THAT 
THAT'S VERY INTERESTING I CAN SEE A LITTLE GLIMMER IN YOUR EYE NOW YES ABSOLUTELY 
LET'S DO SOME MORE MAGIC BECAUSE DOWN HERE 
WE'VE GOT THE GARDEN AS WELL 
SO IMAGINE WITHOUT ALL THAT NASTY TRAFFIC YEAH 
COME ON THIS IS QUINTESSENTIAL ENGLISH COUNTRY GARDEN ISN'T IT 
YES VERY ESTABLISHED PLANTS 
NICE APPLE TREES I'VE NOTICED THEY'VE GOT A LOVELY STELLATA OVER THERE ALREADY 
OH I LOVE A STELLATA ME I CAN'T AVOID A STELLATA 
ABSOLUTELY I LOVE MAGNOLIAS ANYWAY 
OH IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YES A MAGNOLIA STELLATA 
WELL NOW WE'VE DISCUSSED YOUR STELLATA SHALL WE DISCUSS THE PRICE YES 
LET'S DO THAT COME ON THIS WAY 
SO PETER AND ALYSSA YOU'VE SEEN THE COTTAGE 
LOTS OF FOOD FOR THOUGHT BUT NOW IT'S GUESS THE PRICE TIME 
EVERY TIME WE SHOW YOU A PROPERTY WE WANT YOU TO INDEPENDENTLY GUESS THE VALUE 
TO FIND OUT WHO HAS THE FINGER ON THE PULSE 
SO ALYSSA HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK 
I THINK 
SOMETHING IN THE REGION OF THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
DEAD DEAD 
RIGHT O. K. WHAT ABOUT YOU SIR 
I THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE ACTUALLY 
THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE 
ONE OF YOU IS SPOT ON TO THE POUND IN FACT TO THE PENNY WITH THE PRICE REALLY 
WHO DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE I THINK IT'S ME 
SPOT ON YOUNG MAN I HAVE TO SAY BRAVO WE ONLY SEE THAT ONCE IN A BLUE MOON HE HASN'T BEEN CHEATING 
HE HASN'T BEEN LOOKING UP PRICES NO YOU KNOW YOUR PROPERTY PRICES 
THE PRESSURE IS ON FOR YOU IT IS NOW WE'RE OFF TO PROPERTY NUMBER TWO KRISTIAN'S FAVOURITE 
YOU'LL LOVE IT LET'S GO 
NOW THIS IS THE ONE I SPOTTED EARLIER APRIL COTTAGE 
IT'S IN A GREAT SPOT IN THE LITTLE HAMLET OF THREE LEGGED CROSS 
RIGHT NEXT TO THE LOCAL PUB 
THERE'S A LOT OF PICTURESQUE WALKS ON THE DOORSTEP IDEAL FOR THAT ESCAPE FROM THE RAT RACE 
AND BEST OF ALL THIS THREE BEDROOM COTTAGE HAS BEEN TOTALLY RENOVATED BY THE PRESENT OWNER 
RIGHT PETER AND ALYSSA YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO WOOED AT LEAST I HOPE YOU ARE BY MY CHOICE 
FOLLOW ME PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
LOOK AT THIS LOOK AT THE SMILES ALREADY 
ISN'T IT FANTASTIC 
WHAT I'M OFFERING YOU HERE IS A BEAUTIFUL WEATHERBOARD COTTAGE IT'S DELIGHTFUL 
IT'S A CONFECTION OF PERIOD CHARM CHARACTER AND CONTEMPORARY CHIC 
WHAT DO YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY 
IT'S FANTASTIC THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME 
SHE'S SPEECHLESS IS THAT A RARE THING 
I THINK IT IS RIGHT O. K. 
AND YOU LIKE IT PETER I LOVE IT GOOD 
LET ME JUST TELL YOU A BIT ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THIS HOUSE FOUR YEARS AGO A LADY BOUGHT IT 
HER OCCUPATION IS AN INTERIOR DESIGNER 
IT WAS QUITE RUN DOWN AND SHE'S SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS BRINGING IT UP TO THIS CONDITION 
WHEN YOU GO INSIDE YOU'RE GOING TO FALL IN LOVE WITH IT 
IT IS GOING TO KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF 
I'LL KNIT YOU A NEW PAIR IN FACT TAKE THEM OFF NOW BEFORE YOU GO IN 
YOU'LL LOVE IT JUST GO INSIDE YOU'LL BE EXCITED KNOCK MY SOCKS OFF COME ON LET'S GO 
I CAN IMAGINE YOU KNITTING DROP ONE STITCH ONE I'D KNIT YOU A NEW HAIRPIECE 
BY THE LOOK ON HER FACE THERE WE MIGHT AS WELL CANCEL THE APPOINTMENT 
WITH HOUSE NUMBER THREE THEY WON'T WANT TO SEE IT FINGERS CROSSED THIS IS IN THE BAG 
HERE WE GO OOH WHAT HAVE WE HERE 
OH WOW LOOK AT THIS A THROUGH KITCHEN DINER FANTASTIC 
I LOVE THE KITCHEN I LOVE IT LOVE IT 
LOOK AT THE DOOR STABLE DOOR 
YEP THAT'D BE NICE WE COULD OPEN THAT HALFWAY DURING THE SUMMER 
LOTS OF LIGHT AH WELL 
WHEN SHALL WE MOVE IN THEN 
DOMINIC I THINK THEY'RE BEING VERY VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS THEY'RE RUBBING THEIR HANDS WITH GLEE 
I LIKE THE UNITS HERE THESE ARE WONDERFUL 
WONDERFUL WORK SURFACES IT'S UNUSUAL ISN'T IT 
VERY SPACIOUS OBVIOUSLY THIS WAS TWO SEPARATE ROOMS 
THEY'VE KNOCKED THAT DOWN AND YOU'VE GOT THIS NICE THROUGH ROOM 
AND THAT'S WHAT I LIKE THE SENSE OF SPACE DEFINITELY 
EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT OUR HOME IT FEELS LIKE A HOME DOESN'T IT 
YEAH AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE LADY WHO OWNS IT SHE HAS MADE THAT HOUSE BEAUTIFUL 
I'LL GIVE YOU A TEN OUT OF TEN FOR THIS ONE KRIS YOU'VE BLOWN THEM AWAY THANK YOU 
THROUGH INTO OH LOOK WHAT'S THIS THIS IS A STUDY 
OH THAT'S NICE VERY NICE 
WONDERFUL AGAIN THE NEUTRAL TONES WORK WELL I THINK 
YEAH GOOD COLOUR SCHEME 
RIGHT WHAT'S THROUGH HERE THEN 
THIS LOOKS LIKE THE MAIN LOUNGE 
MAIN LIVING ROOM YES ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL 
IT'S A NICE SIZE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
AH H. NICE AND COMFORTABLE 
I FEEL AT HOME ALREADY 
THE ONLY THING I'M SLIGHTLY WORRIED ABOUT OH HERE WE GO HERE WE GO 
IS WHETHER IT'S COTTAGEY ENOUGH 
YES I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
IT'S NOT IT'S MORE OF A HOUSE THAN A COTTAGE 
COTTAGEY ENOUGH 
IT LOOKS VERY COTTAGEY FROM THE OUTSIDE M. M. M. 
BUT IT IS IT'S 
VERY MODERN INSIDE ISN'T IT 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S GOT THAT COTTAGEY FEEL YEAH 
IF YOU WANTED A CLICHE THIS IS IT 
IT'S TWO HUNDRED ODD YEARS OLD IT'S TIMBER CLAD YOU'VE GOT SASH WINDOWS LOVELY GARDEN 
MATURE GARDEN RIGHT BY A VILLAGE PUB SHINGLE ON THE DRIVEWAY 
WHERE DO YOU SEE THAT IN SUBURBIA EH NO 
WHAT'S THE VIEW LIKE OUT THAT WINDOW 
GORGEOUS TREES ALL THE WAY AROUND 
QUIET IT IS QUIET AT THE MOMENT BUT 
THE PUB NEXT DOOR D'YOU THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOME NOISE FROM THAT 
THE PUB'S STILL OPEN CAN YOU HEAR ANYTHING LATE AT NIGHT IT BECOMES OUTRAGEOUSLY NOISY HERE 
UNBEARABLE YOU'VE GOT THE OWLS TWEETING THE BADGERS BURROWING HOLES 
YEAH I TELL YOU IT'S NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE 
RIGHT LET'S SEE WHAT'S UP HERE 
THERE'S A LOO TWO LOOS NEXT TO EACH OTHER THAT'S HANDY 
WE CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER 
THROUGH THE WALL YEAH 
BUT THAT'S QUITE NICE YOU NEED TWO TOILETS I THINK BUT SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER 
DOESN'T MATTER AS LONG AS SOMEONE'S HAVING A BATH AND WE'VE GOT PEOPLE STAYING 
YOU NEED TO HAVE ANOTHER LOO H. M. M. 
SHE'S GETTING RATHER UPSET ABOUT THOSE TWO TOILETS 
SHE'S GETTING ALL FLUSHED YEAH 
WHAT IS THAT OH DEAR OH DEAR 
WELL IT'S OBVIOUSLY A CHILD'S BEDROOM WELL THAT'S GOT TO GO 
I'M SURE NICK WILL BE TAKING ALL THAT STUFF WITH HIM 
I DO NOT LIKE THAT STRANGE YOU'VE GOT THAT NEUTRAL COLOUR 
ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND SUDDENLY YOU'VE GOT BLUE NO DON'T LIKE BLUE 
THINK ABOUT IT NOW DOWNSTAIRS OOH WOW FANTASTIC I WANT TO MOVE IN 
UPSTAIRS I DON'T LIKE THE LAVVY THERE'S BLUE PAINT IN THAT ROOM 
YOU ARE SINKING FASTER THAN THE TITANIC I AM OOH YEAH 
WELL MY FIRST THOUGHTS OF THESE TWO ROOMS THAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR 
I KNOW VERY SMALL 
I'VE GOT A FEELING THIS IS NOT GOING THE WAY YOU WANT IT 
AND IT'S A BIT OF A FUNNY SHAPE THIS ROOM ISN'T IT 
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE FEEL OF THE PLACE HERE IT COMES 
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT COTTAGEY ENOUGH I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING 
OR FOR ME I DON'T THINK 
HOUSE NUMBER ONE IS STILL IN WITH A CHANCE 
NICE VIEW OUT OF THAT WINDOW THIS IS A NICE ROOM 
LOVE THE ROOM LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE WARDROBE 
WHOOPS THAT'S ADEQUATE I SUPPOSE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ENOUGH ROOM 
YOU'D PROBABLY HAVE TO USE ONE OF THE SMALLER BEDROOMS A WARDROBE DRESSING ROOM 
DRESSING ROOM FANTASTIC IDEA 
MY OWN DRESSING ROOM WALK IN DRESSING ROOM WALK IN DRESSING ROOM 
WHAT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF KNOCKING ONE ROOM INTO TWO 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT KNOCKING ANOTHER WALL DOWN 
I'M A BIT DISAPPOINTED NOW 
DOESN'T HAVE THE IT FACTOR THEN NO NOT FOR ME UNFORTUNATELY 
I'M DISAPPOINTED ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE ME A HAND AND HELP SORT THIS SITUATION OUT 
I'M FINDING IT HARD TO GET UP MYSELF 
COME ON GRAB YOUR MOJO BRING IT IN WHERE IS ME MOJO 
ALYSSA I'M AFRAID I CAN BARELY BRING MYSELF TO LOOK AT YOU I'M SO UNHAPPY ANGRY FRUSTRATED 
WHAT OTHER WORDS CAN I USE WHAT HAPPENED 
WELL I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN WE WERE OUTSIDE 
THE GARDEN THE LOCATION THE AREA 
YOU ALMOST DID A BACK FLIP AND A CARTWHEEL I DID I WAS SO EXCITED 
DOWNSTAIRS WENT REALLY WELL 
FINE NOT TERRIBLY COTTAGEY 
BUT WE COULD HAVE MADE IT SO 
RIGHT AND THEN WE WENT UPSTAIRS AND IT ALL WENT DOWNHILL FROM THEN 
WHERE WHERE WHERE WHERE WHERE WHERE 
IT'S JUST THE FEELING YOU GET WHEN YOU WALK INTO EACH ROOM 
YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE HOME IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE 
A COTTAGE YOU KNOW 
NO I DON'T I THOUGHT I'D DELIVERED YOU THE MOST FANTASTIC PROPERTY EVER 
LET'S NOT DISMISS THIS COMPLETELY BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME ADVANTAGES 
THE LOCATION WITH YOUR LITTLE SECRET DRINKING HABIT 
PRIME LOCATION BECAUSE YOU CAN STUMBLE FROM THE PROPERTY TO THE PUB 
YES AND I CAN STUMBLE FROM THE PUB TO THE PROPERTY 
WHICH SOUNDS MORE REALISTIC SO LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS 
LET'S GO IN DISCUSS THE PRICE WITH THE OTHERS 
AND THEN MAKE SOME DECISIONS LATER ON O. K. RIGHT COME ON LET'S GO 
SO FAR WE'VE ONLY SHOWN YOU TWO PROPERTIES 
FIRST PROPERTY MY ONE WHEN WE LET YOU LOOSE IN THERE THE FIRST THING THAT YOU AND ALYSSA DID IS YOU SAID 
RIGHT WE'LL KNOCK THIS WALL DOWN RIP THAT STAIRCASE OUT KNOCK THAT WALL DOWN OPEN IT ALL UP 
YEAH NOW WHAT KRISTIAN'S DELIVERED YOU HERE IS A TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD BUILDING AND THAT'S HAPPENED 
SOMEONE'S DONE ALL OF THAT WORK 
THEY'VE OPENED IT ALL UP 
YET TO YOU AND ALYSSA THAT'S SPOILED THE COTTAGEY FEEL ALMOST YES IT HAS 
I'M STARTING TO WONDER WHETHER THERE COULD BE A BIT OF CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT 
BUT I THINK A LOT OF IT WOULD BE TOO HARD TO CHANGE BEAUTIFUL OAK FLOORING 
BUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT RIP IT UP YOU MIGHT FIND THE ORIGINAL QUARRY TILES UNDERNEATH THAT 
YOU COULD TAKE OFF ALL THIS SMOOTH PLASTER EXPOSE THE BRICKWORK 
YOU'VE GOT A FIREPLACE IN THE FRONT ROOM WHICH IS ORNAMENTAL BECAUSE THE LADY DOESN'T NEED TO USE IT 
TAKE THE LOGS OUT OPEN IT UP USE IT HAVE A LOG BURNER IN THERE 
AND ALL THESE LITTLE TOUCHES WOULD BRING THIS PLACE BACK TO LIFE 
AND GIVE IT THE COTTAGEY FEEL INTERNALLY THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR 
IT'S HORSES FOR COURSES ISN'T IT IT IS SOME PEOPLE LOVE THIS 
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT AND WE HAVE REALISED THAT NOW 
YOU WANT THE SPIDERS THE COBWEBS THE CREAKY FLOORBOARDS ABSOLUTELY 
WELL DO YOU KNOW WHAT JUST WAIT TILL YOU SEE PROPERTY NUMBER THREE YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT 
HERE WE ARE GUESS THE PRICE TIME I'VE GOTTA SAY YOU WERE SO EXCITED OUTSIDE 
DISAPPOINTED WHEN YOU CAME IN STOP IT BUT YOU WERE ALSO MILES AWAY ON THE LAST GUESS THE PRICE 
I KNOW PETER GOT IT SPOT ON 
PLEASE GET IT CLOSEST ON THIS ONE PLEASE PULL IT BACK WE'LL SEE THAT SMILE AGAIN 
LET'S MAKE PETER GO FIRST SHALL WE 
ALL RIGHT GO ON PETER 
H. M. M. THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND 
THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE RIGHT ALYSSA WHAT ABOUT YOU

THANK YOU BUT GUESS WHAT 
NOWHERE NEAR CLOSE ENOUGH 
IT'S THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND OH I MADE HER SMILE FOR A BRIEF SECOND THERE DOM 
AND IT FADED AWAY EBBED AWAY ONCE AGAIN 
I'VE GOT A FUNNY FEELING THAT MIGHT BE THE FINAL NAIL IN THE COFFIN FOR THIS ONE FOR YOU 
LET'S NOT RULE OUT ANYTHING BECAUSE PROPERTY NUMBER THREE THE THIRD ONE THE WILD CARD 
PETER WANTS TO SEE THE WARTS AND ALL YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IT THIS WAY 
NOW IT WOULDN'T TAKE SHERLOCK TO SPOT THAT THIS ONE IS VERY DIFFERENT AND THAT'S WHY IT'S 
OUR WILD CARD BUT WE THINK ONCE THEY RELOCATE PETER AND ALYSSA WILL HAVE MORE TIME ON THEIR HANDS 
TO INVEST IN A PROJECT STAMP THEIR OWN MARK AND TURN THIS OLD COTTAGE INTO THEIR DREAM HOME 
PETER AND ALYSSA KRIS AND I WE'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM SHOWING YOU OUR FIRST TWO PROPERTIES 
MY LOVELY COTTAGE ALL YOU WANTED TO DO WAS PULL WALLS DOWN 
KRIS'S COTTAGE THE WALLS HAVE BEEN PULLED DOWN AND YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT 
SO LIKE A LOT OF GREAT PARTNERSHIPS MR. ROLLS MR. ROYCE SAATCHI AND SAATCHI 
BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD SPEAK FOR YOURSELF 
WE'VE PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER AND WE'VE COME UP WITH THIS THE WILD CARD WHAT DO YOU THINK 
TUMBLEWEED IT LOOKS A BIT SPOOKY 
O. K. SPOOKY VERY GOOD ALYSSA 
SCARY MR. DIGBY AND MR. LITTLEWOOD FEEL WE SHOULD WARN YOU HERE 
THAT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE IS QUITE RUSTIC 
IT HASN'T BEEN TOUCHED FOR QUITE SOME TIME 
IT NEEDS A LOT OF IMAGINATION ON THE INSIDE 
ON THE OUTSIDE AND IN THE GARDEN SO LET'S SEE IF YOU TWO CAN USE THAT IMAGINATION 
AND TURN IT IN YOUR HEADS INTO SOMETHING FANTASTIC 
ARE YOU UP FOR THE CHALLENGE WE'RE UP FOR IT DEFINITELY 
THEY'RE JUST NODDING OUT OF POLITENESS AREN'T THEY GET IN THERE AND HAVE A LOOK ROUND GO ON 
I STILL THINK THIS COULD BE TROUBLE COME ON 
RIGHT DOM HEADPHONES ON 
LET'S FIND OUT IF THIS CHOCOLATE BOX COTTAGE IS GOING TO BE A BOX OF DELIGHTS M. M. M. 
WHOO OOH OOH 
GOD IT'S IN SOME STATE WHOO OOH SPOOKY 
MIND YOU THESE WINDOWS ARE 
THEY'RE GREAT WINDOWS AREN'T THEY THEY'RE FANTASTIC WINDOWS THEY'RE REAL LEAD WINDOWS 
BEAUTIFUL LOADS OF CHARACTER THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE PAYING FOR HERE 
I KNOW I SAID ABOUT PULLING WALLS DOWN IN ONE OF THE OTHER COTTAGES BUT 
THIS MAY BE A BIT TOO MUCH FOR US LYSE 
HE MENTIONED A WALL WITHIN TWENTY SECONDS BUT HE THINKS THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR THEM 
THEY'VE ONLY GOT TO THE FIRST ROOM HUH THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN HERE LONG 
I THINK IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO RUN A PEST CONTROL TRAINING CAMP 
PERHAPS I COULD START UP BUSINESS 
IF YOU BARGAIN YOU'LL PROBABLY GET THE COBWEBS IN THE PRICE BUT AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE EXTRAS 
WELL DE LUXE BATHROOM BY THE LOOKS OF IT 
WE COULD PLUMB A WASHING MACHINE IN THERE YOU COULD LOAD IT UP 
WHAT ABOUT THOSE TILES 
THOSE TILES ARE AN ABSOLUTE STYLE STATEMENT ABOUT THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO

IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE WALKING ROUND A HAUNTED HOUSE 
OH THIS IS THE KITCHEN I GUESS FANTASTIC 
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF THE ADDAMS FAMILY 
DUH DUH DUH DUM I COULD BE UNCLE FESTER 
I KNOW I SAID WARTS AND ALL BUT ER 
I THINK THEY'VE TAKEN IT A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR 
IF EVER THERE WAS A MAN TO BUY THIS HOUSE IT'S HIM 
IF IT'S GOT COCKROACHES WOODWORM DRY ROT HE CAN SORT IT HE CAN EXTERMINATE IT ALL 
OH ANOTHER CUPBOARD LYSE DO YOU WANT TO GO FIRST 
OH 
IT'S THE BOILER ROOM YOU'VE GOT TO GO IN HAVE A GIGGLE AND LOOK AT IT 
BUT THEN YOU SIT DOWN AND YOU'VE GOT TO START DOING YOUR SUMS 
AND THINKING THIS COULD BE A PROJECT THAT COULD BE HOME FOR US 
I THINK YOU'D HAVE TO SPEND 
AT LEAST ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOING IT UP 
AT LEAST WELL 
SHALL WE GO THROUGH AND HAVE A LOOK FURTHER 
YES I CAN'T WAIT 
THEY HAVEN'T LAUGHED AND GIGGLED IN ANY OF THE OTHER TWO PROPERTIES 
AS MUCH AS THIS NOT AT ALL NO NOT AT ALL 
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOOD OR BAD NO I'M NOT SURE EITHER 
O. K. WOW NICE HEATER THIS PROBABLY DOUBLES UP FOR BOTH ROOMS 
YOU CAN IMAGINE AN OLD BUTLER COMING IN AND SAYING YOU RANG M'LORD 
A LITTLE BIT OF DAMP COMING THROUGH THE CEILING THAT'S I SUPPOSE TO BE EXPECTED 
DID HE NOT SAY TO YOU HE WANTED WARTS AND ALL 
THIS MUST BE THE MASTER BEDROOM 
THIS IS THE BEST SIZED ROOM YES 
IT LOOKED PICTURE BOX FROM THE OUTSIDE ALTHOUGH IT NEEDED A LOT OF WORK 
COME ON LET'S GET IN THERE IN THE COLD AND TELL THEM WHAT WE'D DO WITH THE PROPERTY RIGHT 
SO PETER YOU WERE AMAZED BY THE HOUSE 
PREPARE TO GASP IN WONDERMENT AT THE GARDEN YES I WAS 
I WAS DUMFOUNDED WITH THE HOUSE I THINK WELL YOU'LL FIND THIS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY 
YOU'VE HEARD OF THE LOST GARDENS OF HELIGAN I HAVE 
THIS IS LIKE THE LOST GARDENS OF WADHURST IT IS 
IT'S JUST GONE CRAZY LOOK AT THIS PLACE AND THIS LOVELY 
JUST SO MUCH CHARACTER THIS LITTLE BRICK OUTHOUSE 
YEAH WAITING TO BE TURNED INTO SOME FANTASTIC GARDEN FEATURE ONCE AGAIN 
ABSOLUTELY THE REAL MCCOY NO FAKERY HERE 
SO THIS IS YOURS 
MM HMM COME THIS WAY WITH ME THIS BIT OF GROUND IS YOURS 
ALL THIS IS YOURS THE GREENHOUSE THE SHED ALL THESE MATURE TREES AND SHRUBS 
BUT MORE EXCITINGLY THAN THAT PETER 
SO'S ALL THAT FANTASTIC 
WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY BEING SERVED UP HERE IS ONE THIRD OF AN ACRE 
OPENING UP LOOK AT THIS THE PLANTS ARE GOING CRAZY 
LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES GOING WILD RETURNING BACK TO NATURE 
AND IF WE SLIGHTLY CANTER OVER HERE IN THE GUSTY WIND 
PARK OURSELVES HERE THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE TAG ON 
THAT VIEW 
IT'S FANTASTIC I MEAN IT REALLY IS A BEAUTIFUL VIEW NOW I'M GOING TO SUGGEST SOMETHING HERE 
I DON'T KNOW HOW POSSIBLE THIS IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GO TO PLANNING BUT MY WAY OF THINKING IS 
RESTORE THE HOUSE BUT YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT ACCESS ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE 
SO THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING YOU BUILDING YOUR DREAM HOUSE 
DOWN THIS END OF THE GARDEN WITH THOSE VIEWS YEAH 
POSSIBILITIES POSSIBILITIES AND THE POSSIBILITY TO ALSO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY IF IT'S DONE CORRECTLY 
SO THIS IS SO DIFFERENT FROM PROPERTY ONE AND TWO I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO TELL YOU 
YOU KNOW IT YOURSELF DON'T YOU YES WE NEED TO DISCUSS THE PRICE NOW YES WE DO RIGHT 
ALYSSA COME WITH ME OUTSIDE BECAUSE I CAN SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE 
YOU AND PETER ARE LOOKING AT THIS FOR WHAT IT IS IT'S QUITE A FRIGHTENING PROPERTY 
IT NEEDS A FORTUNE SPENDING ON IT THERE'S NO WARMTH IN THERE IT'S COLD DUSTY DAMP 
IT'S QUITE SCARY ISN'T IT VERY BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS LOOK AT IT AS A PROJECT 
NOT AS A HOME AT THE MOMENT NOW WE'VE DONE OUR HOMEWORK KRIS AND I 
THIS AREA IS VERY VERY DESIRABLE THE ESTATE AGENTS GET EXCITED ABOUT ANY HOUSE THAT COMES UP FOR SALE 
UP AND DOWN THIS ROAD AND THEY DON'T LAST FIVE MINUTES 
THIS ONE PUTS OFF THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SEE THROUGH THE STATE OF THE HOUSE 
WHAT YOU COULD DO HERE YOU'RE ON A PRIME BIT OF LAND IT'S A THIRD OF AN ACRE 
IF YOU EXTENDED RIGHT OUT THERE YOU'VE GOT A LOVELY BIT OF LAND THERE AT THE SIDE 
AND COMPLETELY REFURBISHED THIS BUILDING I'M TALKING ABOUT FROM THE FOUNDATIONS UP 
IT NEEDS NEW WINDOWS NEW DOORS NEW EVERYTHING 
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH THE HOUSE IS UP FOR SALE FOR AT THE MOMENT 
BECAUSE THAT'S FOR YOU TO GUESS 
BUT A HOUSE LIKE THAT IN THIS AREA HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE WORTH 
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
FIVE 
SIX NOT SEVEN 
THEY SAY BETWEEN SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR A BUILDING RENOVATED ON THIS PLOT OF LAND IN THIS LOCATION 
NOW THAT PUTS A DIFFERENT LIGHT ON IT DOESN'T IT IT'S A THOUGHT 
YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT ONE HUNDRED GRAND'S WORTH OF WORK TO SPEND ON THAT 
BUT THERE COULD BE A HUGE POTENTIAL THERE TO EARN A LOT OF MONEY AND HAVE A VERY DESIRABLE PROPERTY 
THINK ABOUT IT COS IT'S GUESS THE PRICE TIME NOW ALL RIGHT 
LET'S GO AND JOIN THE OTHERS 
BE HONEST WITH ME YOU'RE BOTH BAMBOOZLED BY THIS AREN'T YOU 
YES A LITTLE BIT 
THESE TWO NOT YOU OH SORRY 
BUT IT IS CONFUSING ISN'T IT WHAT YOU'VE JUST SEEN VERY CONFUSING O. K. WELL LOOK 
WE NEED NOW TO GUESS THE PRICE NOW YOU'VE BOTH GOT ONE RIGHT THIS WILL BE THE DECIDER 
BUT WHAT A HARD PROPERTY TO GUESS THE PRICE ON 
SO PETER COME ON 
WELL BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE WOULD HAVE 
TO SPEND IT WOULD BE REFLECTED IN THE PRICE SO I'M GOING FOR TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
RIGHT O. K. ALYSSA WHAT ABOUT YOU 
WELL THE HOUSE ALONE WITHOUT THE LAND AND THE GARDENS 
I WOULD TEND TO AGREE WITH PETER 
BUT IT DOES HAVE A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN AT THE BACK WITH SOME LAND 
WONDERFUL SO I WOULD GO FOR TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
QUITE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU A HUGE DIFFERENCE 
RIGHT PLEASED TO SAY YOU'RE CLOSEST 
YOU ARE OUR OVERALL WINNER BUT BAD NEWS ABOUT THE PRICE YOU'RE BOTH MILES AWAY 
PETER YOU'RE ON A DIFFERENT PLANET 
LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT IS ON THE MARKET FOR AND YOU CAN TELL ME YOUR OPINION THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
I SUPPOSE IT'S BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF LAND 
IT'S THE LAND ARE YOU ALL RIGHT THERE I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO KEEL OVER 
WELL LOOK JUST THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MINUTE 
BECAUSE IT IS AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE ALL OF THIS 
WE'VE NOW SHOWN YOU ALL THREE PROPERTIES THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO SHOW IS THERE DOM NO 
AND WE WANT YOU TO FIND OUT WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO TRY BEFORE YOU BUY 
TO AID YOU WITH THAT DECISION HIDDEN IN A DUSTY CUPBOARD OVER HERE I HAVE A LAPTOP 
IN THIS LAPTOP IMAGES OF ALL THREE PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN STORED 
YOU CAN LOOK AT THOSE AND PICK THE ONE YOU WANT TO SPEND SOME TIME IN AS YOU'RE THE WINNER IT'S YOURS 
WE'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER 
O. K. LOVELY SEE YOU LATER MIND THE GHOSTS 
COR TELL YOU WHAT THEY WERE SHOCKED AT THAT VERY SHOCKED INDEED 
AND WHILE THEY STUDY THE LAPTOP PROPERTIES 
FIRST WAS CHERRY TREE COTTAGE AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY DETACHED HOME WITH LOTS OF PERIOD FEATURES 
BUT HERE PETER AND ALYSSA WANTED TO PULL DOWN ALMOST EVERY WALL IN THE PLACE 
SO TO SAVE THEM THE HASSLE WE SHOWED THEM A MORE OPEN PLAN HOME 
APRIL COTTAGE AN HISTORIC WEATHERBOARDED PROPERTY 
THIS WASN'T QUITE WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR THEY WEREN'T KEEN ON THE CONTEMPORARY DECOR 
SO ALL THAT WAS LEFT WAS TO GIVE THEM SOMETHING 
ON WHICH THEY COULD STAMP THEIR MARK MYRTLE COTTAGE 
IT HAD ALL THE MAKINGS OF A CHOCOLATE BOX HOUSE BUT DIDN'T INSPIRE ANY SWEET VISIONS 
BUT DOM WHAT WILL THEY MAKE OF THE PROPERTIES IN RETROSPECT 
IT'S FAIRLY WELL SECLUDED YEAH IT'S SECLUDED YOU CAN'T SEE THE ROAD CAN YOU 
NO THAT'S TRUE LET'S GO INSIDE AND HAVE A LOOK O. K. JUST PRESS THAT 
NOW THAT STAIRWAY IT HITS YOU 
HITS YOU STRAIGHT AWAY 
BUT I LIKE THE SIZE OF THE COTTAGE THE SIZE OF THE PROPERTY WAS GOOD 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT APRIL COTTAGE 
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU EXCITED LIKE THAT FOR A LONG WHILE 
IT JUST LOST ITS COTTAGEY FEEL 
I WAS JUST INSTANTLY DEFLATED YEAH 
NO RUSTIC CHARM AT ALL I THOUGHT 
NOW THE WILD CARD 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT 
WILD IT WAS CERTAINLY WILD YEAH 
QUAINT FROM THE ROAD YEAH 
CHARMING 
YOU COULD TAKE THAT GARDEN AND PUT ANOTHER COTTAGE THERE 
I THINK THAT WOULD BE IDEAL 
SO I SUPPOSE WE'VE GOT TO MAKE A DECISION NOW 
I THINK I'VE MADE MY DECISION 
I THINK I'VE MADE MINE TOO 
WELL PETER AND ALYSSA WHAT A ROLLERCOASTER IT'S BEEN AND AFTER ALL THAT 
YOU'VE DECIDED YOU WANT TO ROAD TEST MY CHOICE PROPERTY NUMBER TWO 
BUT I HAVE TO ASK A QUESTION 
WE LEFT ON A BIT OF A DOWNER WHEN YOU FIRST ARRIVED YOU SEEMED ABSOLUTELY WEDDED TO THE PROPERTY 
THEN SOME DIVORCE EMOTIONALLY WENT ON AND YOU HATED IT 
SO WHY ARE WE BACK WELL I THINK INITIALLY I COULDN'T ENVISAGE THE CHANGE OF BRINGING 
IT BACK TO ITS FORMER GLORY AND SOME RUSTIC CHARACTERISTICS THAT I FEEL I WANT FOR MYSELF FAIR ENOUGH 
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU ALYSSA WELL WE'VE BEEN GIVING IT SOME THOUGHT 
AND I THINK THERE'S ONE OR TWO THINGS I CAN DO TO MAKE THE PLACE LOOK A BIT MORE RUSTIC 
WHICH WOULD REALLY BE MY IDEAL 
NOW BEFORE WE LET YOU LOOSE IN THERE TO DO YOUR TEST DRIVE 
TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY'S SURVEYOR HAS GIVEN THE HOUSE A ONCE OVER 
AND HAS FOUND A COUPLE OF POINTS TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION 
NOW THIS IS NOT A LEGALLY BINDING SURVEY WE'D ALWAYS IMPLORE YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY A PROPERTY 
THAT YOU GET A FULL STRUCTURAL SURVEY CARRIED OUT FIRST 
HOWEVER INTERESTING INFORMATION 
THE FIRST THING IS THIS HOUSE IS OF A TIMBER FRAME CONSTRUCTION 
NOW THE LATTER HALF OF THE HOUSE IS A LOT OLDER THAN THE FRONT HALF 
AND HE'S SAID THAT IT HASN'T GOT ANY DAMP PROOF COURSE THERE 
HE DOESN'T WANT TO START INVESTIGATING TOO MUCH AT THIS POINT 
BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY THIS HOUSE 
POINT THAT AREA OUT TO A SURVEYOR AND GET THEM TO HAVE A GOOD LOOK AT IT 
O. K. SO ENJOY YOUR TEST DRIVE AND WE'LL SEE HOW YOU GET ON LATER ON O. K. 
HAVE FUN ALL YOURS SHALL WE SCARPER NOT HALF LET'S DO IT 
AND STRAIGHT AWAY PETER GOT STUCK INTO HIS TERMINATOR ROLE 
ANY PESTS WERE GOING TO GET ANNIHILATED 
NATURALLY HE FAILED TO FIND HIS PREY 
BUT I'M GLAD TO SAY PETER AND ALYSSA DID FIND TIME TO RELAX AND WATCH AN OSCAR WINNING PERFORMANCE 
LOOK THERE'S OLD DOMINIC 
HE'S GOOD ON THE LEFT 
WELL PETER AND ALYSSA YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND A COUPLE OF TIMES ABOUT THIS PROPERTY 
NOW THAT YOU'VE SPENT A BIT OF TIME HERE HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT NOW 
WELL WE TRIED TO GET A FEEL FOR THE PLACE 
WE DID THE COUNTRY THINGS WALKED DOWN TO THE VILLAGE DID A BIT OF SHOPPING

THAT QUESTION BEING TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY ARE YOU GOING TO BARTER OR ARE YOU GOING TO SCARPER 
WELL WE'RE GOING TO SCARPER I'M AFRAID WE'RE GOING TO SCARPER OH DEAR 
CAN I ASK WHY WELL 
AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND WE DISCUSSED IT IT'S JUST NOT QUITE THE RIGHT PROPERTY FOR US 
THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH BUT IT'S GIVEN US SOME IDEA OF WHAT'S AVAILABLE 
WITHIN OUR PRICE RANGE THAT'S ALL FAIR ENOUGH KRIS 
YOU'LL KNOW WHEN YOU HIT THE RIGHT PROPERTY WE WILL WE WISH YOU LUCK
