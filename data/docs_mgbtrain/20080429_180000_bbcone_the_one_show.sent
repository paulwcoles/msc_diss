HELLO WELCOME TO THE ONE SHOW WITH 
ADRIAN CHILES AND CHRISTINE 
BLEAKLEY TERRY WAITE IS WITH US 
TERRY WILL BE TAKING US BACK TO THE 
HOUSE HE GREW UP IN ANJELICA IS 
HERE WONDERING WHY SCIENCE FICTION 
IS BEING SEEN AS RATHER SEXY JOHN 
PRESCOTT'S REVELATION THAT HE 
SUFFERED FROM BUT LIMB MA HAS BEEN 
GREETED WITH A FAIR AMOUNT OF 
MOCKERY PERHAPS EXPLAINING WHY HE 
HAS KEPT QUIET ABOUT IT FOR SO LONG 
JOHN STAPLETON KNOWS ABOUT THIS HE 
BELIEVES MORE MEN SHOULD FOLLOW 
JOHN PRESCOTT'S LEAD AND SPEAK OUT 
GORDON BROWN FINDS HIMSELF UNDER 
PRESSURE ONCE AGAIN L. LOVE MY JOB 
BUT IN MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS OF 
TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR 
LIVES THERE WAS ONE THING ABOUT 
MINE I ALWAYS KEPT SECRET THE FACT 
THAT I HAD AN EATING DISORDER AT 
THE START OF MY ILLNESS MY ROLE 
MODELS WERE THE STICK THIN STONES 
LOSING WEIGHT BECAME AN OBSESSION 
I COULD GO FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS 
WITHOUT EATING A PROPER MEAL AND 
THE POUNDS ROLLED OFF THE 
REVELATION THAT JOHN PRESCOTT 
SUFFERED FROM BULIMIA DIDN'T 
SURPRISE ME WHAT DID SHOCK ME WAS 
THE UNSYMPATHETIC RESPONSE FROM 
CERTAIN SECTIONS OF THE MEDIA 
LITTLE WONDER HE KEPT HIS CONDITION 
SECRET FOR SO LONG 
I FOUND IT 
DIFFICULT AS A MAN LIKE ME TO ADMIT 
I SUFFERED FROM BULIMIA THE 
DOCTORS TOLD ME IT WAS PROBABLY DUE 
TO STRESS 
I GUESS THE SHOCK THAT 
GREETED MR. PRESCOTT SPEAKING SO 
OPENLY ABOUT HIS PROBLEM SHOWS 
SOCIETY STILL DOESN'T EXPECT MEN TO 
HAVE EATING DISORDERS IT SURPRISES 
PEOPLE THAT THESE CONDITIONS CAN 
AFFECT PEOPLE WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL 
JOHN PRESCOTT WAS DEPUTY PRIME 
MINISTER 
ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT MINISTER PEOPLE WITH EATING DISORDERS THEY 
ARE OFTEN VERY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE 
THEY ARE VERY DRIVEN AND OFTEN THEY 
STRUGGLE WITH SELF ESTEEM THEY ARE 
ALWAYS TRYING TO DO BETTER AND 
BETTER AND BETTER AND THEY OFTEN 
FIND IT DIFFICULT TO FEEL SATISFIED 
WITH THINGS AS THEY ARE THEY 
ALWAYS WANT TO GO ONE STEP FURTHER 
WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS US MEN HAVE 
SUCH A DIFFICULTY IN TALKING ABOUT 
THIS WHEN I HAD MY PROBLEM NO MAN 
WOULD HAVE DREAMT OF TALKING ABOUT 
ANOREXIA AND I SUSPECT THAT TO 
SOME EXTENT IS STILL TRUE 
I THINK 
FOR A LONG TIME MEN STIFF UPPER 
LIP DON'T TALK ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS 
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM GO DOWN THE 
PUB YOU DEAL WITH IT IN OTHER WAYS 
I COMPLETELY RELATE TO WHAT THE 
DOCTOR SAID THIS IS A PICTURE OF 
ME AT THE TIME LOOK AT THE LEGS 
AND THE REASON I HAVE MY SHIRT ON 
IS IF I TOOK IT OFF YOU COULD SEE 
MY CHEST 
WAS LIKE A TOAST RACK WAS SAVED BY A GOOD WOMAN WHEN I 
SET UP HOME WITH LYNN I SLOWLY BUT 
SURELY STARTED EATING PROPERLY 
AGAIN BELIEVE IT OR NOT IT WAS THIRTY 
YEARS BEFORE I TOLD EVEN HER THAT 
PRIOR TO MEETING HER I HAD BEEN 
DELIBERATELY STARVING MYSELF 
TODAY SOME MEN CONTINUE TO SUFFER 
ALONE IT IS ESTIMATED THAT TEN PER CENT OF 
PEOPLE WITH EATING DISORDERS ARE 
MEN THIRTY THREE YEAR OLD ROB HAS BEEN 
BATTLING WITH ANOREXIA SINCE HE WAS 
THIRTEEN TO HIM IT IS AN ISSUE OF SELF 
PUNISHMENT 
I HAVEN'T MET SOMEONE PUNISHMENT WITH AN EATING DISORDER THAT HASN'T 
LIKED FOOD BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T 
LIKE FOOD THEN IT'S NO PUNISHMENT 
IF YOU DON'T EAT THE POINT OF IT 
FOR ME ANY WAY WAS THAT IT WAS A 
PUNISHMENT AND THEREFORE TO DENY 
MYSELF SOMETHING I REALLY ENJOYED 
WAS A WAY OF HURTING MYSELF 
I KNOW 
THAT WHEN I HAD MY PROBLEM I USED 
TO FIB PEOPLE USED TO SAY TO ME 
HAVE YOU EATEN AND I WOULD SAY YES 
AND I HADN'T AT ALL TO GET OVER 
THE PROBLEM DID YOU DO THE SAME 
THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE OF SITTING 
DOWN WITH MY MUM MY DAD AND SISTER 
AND FEELING PRESSURED TO EAT THIS 
MEAL AND LOOKING AT THE FOOD AND 
THINKING HOW AM I GOING TO COPE 
WITH THIS FOOD INSIDE MY STOMACH I 
WAS TERRIFIED 
YOU HAVE A 
PHOTOGRAPH OF YOURSELF AROUND THIS 
PERIOD 
I HAVE A PHOTO OF WHEN I PERIOD WAS TWENTY TWO AND I HAD JUST COME OUT OF 
HOSPITAL AND I PUT ON FOUR KILOS 
AND MY DAD TOOK A PHOTO OF ME AND I 
WAS SO UPSET WHEN I SAW THE PHOTO 
I JUST HAD TO WRITE ON IT GOOD GOOD HEAVENS THE WRITING ON IT SAYS THIRTY FOUR 
KILOS NEED TO BE UNDER THIRTY AND YOU 
THOUGHT LOOKING LIKE THAT THAT YOU 
WERE FAT 
YES I WAS CONVINCED THAT 
I WAS FAT 
IT SASENS ME TOE THINK 
HOW LITTLE THINGS HAVE CHANGED FROM 
WHEN I WAS YOUNG EVEN TODAY THERE 
SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING STOPPING US 
MEN BEING OPEN ABOUT OUR BODY IMAGE 
MEN ARE VERY PROUD OF THEMSELVES 
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO ADMIT YOU ARE 
ON A DIET 
THE REASON THEY ARE SO 
EMBARRASSED IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A 
MACHO IMAGE AND THEY ALWAYS WANT TO 
MAINTAIN THE MACHO IMAGE ANY FLAW 
IN IT WOULD BE SEEN AS A WEAKNESS 
WOMEN CAN TALK ABOUT THAT EASIER 
MEN JUST HAVE THAT IN THEIR HEAD 
THAT YOU CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT THINGS 
LIKE THAT DON'T KNOW WHY OUR OUR IMAGE OBSESSED CULTURE PUTS EVER 
MORE PRESSURE ON US TO CONFIRM TO A 
CERTAIN LOOK EVEN MEN'S MAGAZINES 
OFTEN FULL OF WOMEN AND CARS ARE 
HAVING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE ONE ONE THING WE TRY AND DO IS CREATE AN 
ENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE CAN SPEAK 
TO EACH OTHER AND COMMUNICATE WE 
HAVE OUR FORUMS ON THE WEBSITE AND 
PEOPLE ARE ENCOURAGED TO WRITE IN 
AND TALK ABOUT PROBLEMS RATHER THAN 
KEEP THEM INSIDE IF WE PRESENT 
PEOPLE WITH CHANNEL WHERE THEY CAN 
TALK TO EACH OTHER HOPEFULLY WILL 
TALK ABOUT WAYS THEY CAN IMPROVE 
THEIR HEALTH AND LIVE LONGER UNTIL UNTIL MEN REALLY DO START DISCUSSING 
ANXIETY OVER THE WAY THEY LOOK 
THERE'S RISK THE ISSUE WILL 
CONTINUE TO BE SWEPT UNDER THE 
CARPET 
MY MESSAGE WOULD BE 
TO TALK CARPET TO FRIENDS TALK TO FAMILY NOT 
FEEL ISOLATED WITHIN THE ILLNESS 
DON'T BE EMBARRASSED AND DEFINITELY 
GET HELP 
JOHN I WASN'T AWARE OF 
YOUR STORY THERE AT ALL YOU THINK 
IF IT WAS A WOMAN HAD COME OUT IN 
THE PRESS RECENTLY WITH THE SAME 
PROBLEMS SHE WUNT HAVE BEEN RID 
ULED IN THE WAY JOHN PRESCOTT HAD 
BEEN 
NO AND JOHN PRESCOTT SUFFERED BEEN BECAUSE HE WAS A POLITICIAN L. DID 
THINK IT WAS UNFAIR LOTS OF PEOPLE 
HAVE LOTS OF REASONS FOR POKING FUN 
AT JOHN THIS ISN'T ONE OF THEM IT 
IS A VERY SERIOUS CONDITION YOU YOU HAVE AN INTERESTING TAKE ON THIS 
FROM WHEN URN FIRST TAKEN HOSTAGE 
IN BEIRUT 
WHEN I WAS FIRST TAKEN 
HOSTAGE I WAS ANGRY BECAUSE I WAS 
PUT IN AN UNDERGROUND CELL AND I 
DIDN'T EAT FOR A WEEK BUT THERE 
WERE TWO REASONS FOR THAT AND THE 
FIRST ONE WAS THAT I WANTED TO 
DEMONSTRATE THAT I STILL HAD A 
MEASURE OF FREEDOM OVER MY ACTIONS 
ALTHOUGH I HAD BEEN CAPTURED I HAD 
THAT AREA OF FREEDOM TO CONTROL 
MYSELF SECONDLY IT WAS REALLY A 
DESIRE TO STRENGTHEN MY WILL 
BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS GOING TO FACE 
PROBABLY GOING TO FACE DIFFICULT 
TIMES AND I HAD SOMEHOW TO 
DISCIPLINE MY MIND TO DO THAT IT IT IS THE SAME PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESS 
AS MY LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF IT 
GOES ON IN THE MINDS OF ANOREXICS 
EXERCISING CONTROL 
AT THE TIME I 
THOUGHT IT WAS VANITY I THOUGHT 
THIN WAS CHIC BUT SUBSEQUENTLY IT 
HAS BEEN EXPLAINED TO ME IT IS ALSO 
ABOUT CONTROL L. WAS AT THE TIME IN 
FLEET STREET AS A NEWSPAPER 
REPORTER AND I WAS UNSURE OF MYSELF 
I WAS YOUNG AND GREEN I COULDN'T 
CONTROL THAT JOB BUT I COULD 
CONTROL THIS L. WAS AMBITIOUS 
REALLY DRIVEN ANYTHING I TOOK ON I 
WANTED TO DO REALLY REALLY WELL 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT DOES ANY 
OF IT RING BELLS WITH YOU 
I WAS 
ALWAYS A BIG GIRL GROWING UP IATE 
A LOT OF FOOD IT WAS WHEN I FIRST 
STARTED WORKING ON T. V. I BECAME 
AWARE OF MY WEIGHT PEOPLE SAID YOU 
LOOK BIGGER ON T. V. IATE ANYTHING I 
WANTED BUT NOW I AM VERY CAREFUL 
AND I ALWAYS 
THAT IS NOT A 
HEALTHY THING NECESSARILY 
NO IT'S 
NOT BUT THE PRESSURES OF T. V. YOU 
WANT TO LOOK GOOD AND PEOPLE 
COMMENT ON YOUR WEIGHT SO YOU 
BECOME OBSESSED 
PEOPLE SAY TO ME 
YOU LOOK MUCH SLIMMER OFF AIR AS 
THOUGH I AM A BETTER PERSON AS 
THOUGH YOU ARE A NICER PERSON 
THAT'S RIGHT THE ANSWER IS TO TALK 
ABOUT IT IF I HAD GONE TO THE 
DOCTORS WHEN I WAS HAVING THIS 
PROBLEM ALL THOSE YEARS AGO I 
WOULD HAVE BEEN LAUGHED OUT THE 
SURGERY BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME NOW 
AND PEOPLE ARE MORE SYMPATHETIC 
IF YOU SUFFER FROM ANY OF THESE 
CONDITIONS THERE IS A NUMBER ON 
THE WEBSITE YOU MIGHT FIND HELPFUL 
HERE IS SOMEONE WHO WILL HAVE AN 
INTERESTING VIEW ON THIS L. WOULD 
LIKE YOU TO MEET ROBERTO ENRIEU 
FROM COVENTRY THIS IS HIM AT FORTY TWO 
STONE WITH A SIXTY SIX INCH WAIST THIS IS 
HIM TWENTY THREE STONE LIGHTER PUT IT THERE 
CONGRATULATIONS HAVING WATCHED 
THAT FILM AND LISTENING TO JOHN 
THERE YOU HAD YOUR OWN STRUGGLE 
WITH FOOD IN A DIFFERENT WAY WE 
ARE NOT ALL FORTY TWO STONE HOW DID IT 
GET TO THAT STAGE FOR YOU 
IT WAS A 
CONJUNCTION OF THINGS IT WAS NOT 
EATING PROPERLY THE SAME DISORDER 
REALLY BUT IT IS EATING MASSIVE 
AMOUNTS OF FOOD WRONG TIME OF THE 
DAY VERY LATE IN THE EVENING NOT 
EATING PROPERLY DURING THE DAY AND 
NOT HAVING ANY EXERCISE AT ALL IT IT WAS TWENTY STONE OR THIRTY STONE WHAT WAS 
IT THAT MADE YOU THINK I HAVE GOT 
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS 
IT IS 
WHEN YOU CAN'T WALK DOWN THE STREET 
WITHOUT GETTING OUT OF BREATH YOU 
CAN'T WALK UP A NIGHT OF STAIRS 
YOU CAN'T ENJOY A NORMAL LIFE WITH 
YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHEN YOU GO 
OUT YOU HAVE ALWAYS GOT PEOPLE 
STARING AT YOU WHEN YOU ARE THAT 
SORT OF SIZE YOU STAND OUT IN A 
CROWD WHEREAS NOW WITH THE WEIGHT 
I AM NOBODY PAYS ANY INTEREST TO 
ME AT ALL I JUST FIT IN WITH 
EVERYBODY ELSE

EXERCISE NOWT AND HEALTHING EATING

OF ALIENS TIME TRAVEL AND OUTER 
SPACE THOSE WERE THE DAYS WHEN YOU 
COULD SPOT A SCI FI ENTHUSIAST A 
MILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY

BLAKES SEVEN WAS A SOAP OPERA SET IN 
SPACE EVEN DOCTOR WHO WAS LOADED WITH

MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH SCIENCE 
FICTION GOES BACK OVER FIFTY YEARS 
DAN DARE AND THE EAGLE I KEPT THE 
FIRST FIFTY COPIES OF MY EAGLE 
ARE YOU CONVINCED 
I AM NOT A BIG 
SCI FI FAN BUT I THINK WE ARE IN A 
NEW GOLDEN AGE WITH THINGS LIKE

SEXY MODERN ISSUES ARE REFLECTED 
IN THE SHOWS 
AND THE ABILITY TO 
MAKE THINGS LOOK BETTER 
IT LOOKS 
FANTASTIC AND GOOD LOOKING 
CHARACTERS IN THERE AS WELL L. HAVE 
SOME PRESENTS FOR YOU THAT IS FOR 
YOU A NICE HANDSOME MASK FOR YOU 
ADRIAN 
DO I LOOK LIKE ANYONE IN ADRIAN PARTICULAR DO I SOUND LIKE A DALEK PARTICULAR IN THIS 
WE HAVE CREATED OUR OWN BITS OF 
SCIENCE FICTION LAST NIGHT WHEN WE 
PUT BLETCHLEY PARK IN HERTFORDSHIRE 
NO LESS THAN SIXTY FOUR OF YOU E. MAILED 
WITH THE HARD SCIENTIFIC FACT THAT 
IT IS IN FACT IN BUCKINGHAMSHIRE 
WE STAND CORRECTED HERE IS 
SOMETHING WE KNOW FORER SHE THOUGH 
TERRY WAS BROUGHT UP IN A VILLAGE 
IN CHESHIRE AND HAS BROUGHT US TO 
THE HOUSE HE GREW UP IN 
IT TURNS 
OUT THERE WERE ASPECTS OF HIS LIFE 
THERE WHICH DID PREPARE HIM FOR 
WHAT ONE DAY HE'D HAVE TO ENDURE IN 
BEIRUT 
I GREW UP IN A LITTLE VILLAGE 
CALLED STYAL WHICH IS ABOUT ELEVEN 
MILES SOUTH OF MANCHESTER L. LIVED 
HERE FROM THE AGE OF FOUR UNTIL 
ABOUT FOURTEEN WITH MY MOTHER AND FATHER 
AND MY BROTHER AND SISTER 
INTERESTING ENOUGH IT WAS THE 
LOCAL POLICE STATION AND OF COURSE 
IT WAS HERE AS THE SON OF A 
POLICEMAN I WAS IN A RATHER ODD 
POSITION IT ALMOST FORCED ME INTO 
A CERTAIN SOLITARY LIFE L. MEAN I 
DID MIX WITH OTHERS BUT ALSO AT 
THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW YOU WERE 
CERTAINLY ONE STEP APART BECAUSE 
YOU WERE THE SON OF THE VILLAGE 
POLICEMAN 
WELL THIS LITTLE ROOM THAT I 
HARDLY RECOGNISED WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO 
THE POLICE SERVICE OFFICE AND IT 
HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE REST 
OF THE HOUSE IT WAS AN EXTREMELY 
AUSTERE ROOM YOU WOULD COME INTO 
THE FRONT ROOM THROUGH A DOOR HERE 
THERE WAS A DESK A CANDLESTICK 
TELEPHONE AND THERE WAS A FILING 
CABINET MY FATHER HAD A VERY HARD 
LIFE AS A BOY AND SO MUCH SO THAT 
HE RAN AWAY FROM HOME AND IT WAS 
IN CHESTER HE JOINED THE POLICE 
FORCE AND EVENTUALLY CAME HERE 
WHERE HE REALLY WAS WELL RESPECTED 
IN THIS COMMUNITY BUT HE WAS TO 
ME HE WAS A DISCIPLINARIAN L. 
DON'T THINK HE WAS AN EASY FATHER 
HE HAD VERY VERY DEEP FEELINGS 
BUT HE WAS A DISCIPLINARIAN ONE OF 
MY EARLIEST MEMORYS IS GETTING 
SCARLET FEVER WHICH MEANT THAT YOU 
HAD TO BE ISOLATED FROM THE REST OF 
THE FAMILY AND THE REST OF THE 
COMMUNITY I ALWAYS REMEMBER BEING 
IN THIS WARD IN A HOSPITAL I 
THINK IT WAS IN MACCLESFIELD THERE 
WAS A GLASS WINDOW AND I SAW THIS 
COUPLE LOOKING AT ME AND WAVING 
AND I WAVED BACK L. WONDERED WHO 
THEY WERE YOU KNOW THEY WERE MY 
PARENTS AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE 
EARLIEST MEMORIES OF SOLITUDE IN 
NO WAY WOULD I SAY I WAS SAD AS A 
CHILD OF COURSE LIKE ALL CHILDREN 
THERE WERE MOMENTS OF SADNESS BUT 
I WAS QUITE HAPPY TO BE WITH MY OWN 
COMPANY AND YEARS LATER WHEN I WAS 
IN BEIRUT ALONE I THOUGHT WELL 
YOU KNOW HOW TO BE ALONE YOU'VE 
GOT IT WITHIN YOU JUST DRAW ON 
THAT AND OF COURSE DRAW ON THE 
MEMORIES AND I DREW ON THE 
MEMORIES OF THESE YEARS OF 
CHILDHOOD YEARS AND THE GOOD 
MEMORIES THE NOT SO GOOD MEMORIES 
BUT THEY WERE SUSTAINING BECAUSE AS 
ADREW I DREW ON THEM THEY 
REINFORCED MY IDENTITY AND WHEN 
YOU'RE IN CAPTIVITY IN TOTAL 
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT THERE IS 
NOBODY THERE TO GIVE YOU YOUR 
IDENTITY YOU HAVE TO FIND IT FROM 
WITHIN AND IT WAS FROM THIS PLACE 
THAT I BEGAN TO REALISE WELL 
THAT'S WHERE I COULD DRAW MY 
STRENGTH THE KITCHEN BRINGS BACK 
MEMORIES OF MY MOTHER SHE WAS VERY 
CARING ABOUT THE FAMILY AND SHE 
WAS VERY MUCH THE OLD FASHIONED 
HOUSEWIFE SHE NEVER WENT OUT TO 
WORK BUT SHE WAS CERTAINLY KEPT 
FULLY OCCUPIED IN THE HOUSE AND 
WAS A WAS A WARM AND KIND AND 
GENEROUS PERSON L. L. DON'T KNOW HOW 
THEY MANAGED ON SUCH A SMALL SALARY 
A POLICEMAN'S SALARY AND OF COURSE 
MY FATHER HAD TO EKE OUT HIS MEAGRE 
SALARY BY THE GARDEN WHICH WAS 
FULL OF VEGETABLES TODAY IT'S 
FLOWERS BUT THEN IT WAS VEGETABLES 
AND FRUIT STRAWBERRIES 
RASPBERRIES BLACKCURRANTS 
GOOSEBERRIES POTATOES AND WE 
EXISTED ON THAT 
WELL THIS VERY SMALL ROOM THE 
FIRST TIME I HAVE BEEN BACK IN IT 
IN OVER FIFTY YEARS THIS WAS MY 
BEDROOM AND I SUPPOSE IT'S TRUE TO 
SAY IT WAS SOMETHING OF MY SPACE 
MY SANCTUARY THE PLACE I COULD 
COME AND READ QUIETLY L. USED 
TO GO TO THE SECOND HAND BOOK SHOP AND 
PURCHASE ARMFULS OF BOOKS ARTHUR 
RANTSEN ENID BLIGHT ALL THE 
FAMOUS ARTHURS CHILDREN READ 
HAVING LOVED BOOKS ALL MY LIFE I 
REALLY MISSED THEM IN CAPTIVITY L. 
THINK IT WAS ALMOST THREE YEARS 
BEFORE I GOT ANY DECENT BOOKS WHAT 
I DISCOVERED IS I'D LEARNED THE 
LANGUAGE OF THE PRAYER BOOK BY 
HEART I DON'T THINK I EVER FELT IN 
CAPTIVITY I DIDN'T FEEL THE CLOSE 
PRESENCE OF GOD BUT SOMEHOW YOU 
KNOW I DIDN'T 
LOSE HOPE L. DIDN'T LOSE FAITH L. KEPT IT AND IT WAS 
REINFORCED BY THE MEMORIES THAT 
COME FROM THIS PLACE 
THOSE CHILDHOOD MEMORIES ARE SO 
IMPORTANT AREN'T THEY THEY JUST 
FLOODED BACK THERE 
IT'S VERY 
INTERESTING THAT'S THE FIRST TIME 
I'VE SEEN THAT FILM AND TO GO BACK 
TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU WERE BROUGHT 
UP IS A REALLY QUITE A REMARKABLE 
EXPERIENCE AND AS I WAS SPEAKING 
THERE ABOUT MEMORIES IT JUST 
REMINDS ME HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO 
GIVE CHILDREN GOOD MEMORIES YOU 
KNOW MY OWN GRANDCHILDREN TRY TO 
GIVE THEM SOME GOOD POSITIVE 
MEMORIES THERE WILL BE DOWNS IN 
LIFE BUT YOU NEEDN'T BE DEPRESSED 
BY THAT WE ALL HAVE THAT YOU YOU OBVIOUSLY ENJOYED GOING BACK AND 
FOUND IT VERY MOVING HAVE YOU BEEN 
BACK TO BEIRUT WHAT'S IT BEEN 
LIKE 
I HAVE BEEN BACK TO BUT YES LIKE AND BEIRUT YES AND IT'S 
REMARKABLE REALLY BECAUSE I 
RECEIVED A TERRIFIC WELCOME FROM 
THE LOCAL PEOPLE WHO WERE REALLY 
GRATEFUL THAT I DIDN'T EXPRESS 
BITTERNESS I WASN'T BITTER I'M 
NOT BITTER ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO 
ME I WAS TAKEN AS A RESULT OF 
DUPLICITY POLITICAL DO YOU KNOW 
POLICETY I 
KNEW DUPLICITY L. KNEW WHAT I WAS GOING INTO THE THE GHASTLIEST STORY PROBABLY ANY OF US 
WILL EVER COME ACROSS OF THE POOR 
GIRL HELD HOSTAGE IMPRISONED IN 
THE BASEMENT OF A HOUSE IN AUSTRIA 
WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU MAKE OF 
THAT 
IT'S ONE OF THESE INCREDIBLE THAT STORIES I HAVE BEEN HEARING IT ON 
THE NEWS L. WANTED TO SWITCH THE 
RADIO OFF L. THOUGHT HOW MUCH OF 
THIS CAN I BEAR HOW BIZARRE CAN IT 
GET IT'S JUST TERRIBLE SHE WAS 
LOCKED AWAY UNDERGROUND FOR WHAT 
TWENTY FOUR YEARS SO WE WERE LED TO BELIEVE 
I WAS ONLY FIVE YEARS NOTHING 
COMPARED TO THAT 
IT'S GOOD TO SEE 
YOU SO WELL AND YOU'RE BUSY AS YOU 
WANT TO BE YOU'RE TRAVELLING ALL 
OVER THE WORLD 
TRAVELLING ALL OVER 
THE WORLD LOS OF PROJECT LOTS OF 
THING STILL WORKING WITH HOSTAGES 
AND THE HOMELESS WORKING IN 
VARIETY OF WAYS AND ENJOYING IT AND 
GRATEFUL FOR SOME OF THOSE MEMORIES 
FROM CHILDHOOD 
WE HAVE ENJOYED IT 
THANKS THANKS WE HAVE LEARNED THE ONE SHOW'S 
TOUGH TALKING DOG MATCHER IS A HARD 
MAN TO PLEASE 
THE ONE THING HE 
DOESN'T LIKE IS MATCHING PEOPLE TO 
DOGS PEOPLE KEEP GOING TO HIM 
ASKING HIM WHAT DOG TO GO FOR AND 
HE TELLS THEM DON'T HAVE A DOG AT 
ALL IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A HAPPY 
ENDING 
DON'T GIVE IT AWAY LET'S ENDING SEE HOW TODAY'S DOG WANTERS GET ON 
ELLIE HARRISON TAKES THE LEAD 
KEITH MATTHEWS HAS DEDICATED HIS 
LIFE TO DOGS HE'S TRAINED 
THOUSANDS OF THEM 
I HAVE DEALT 
WITH EVERY PROBLEM IMAGINABLE THE 
ONE COMMON FACTOR IS LOT OF THE 
PROBLEMS ARE USUALLY DOWN TO THE 
OWNER 
HE RECKONS CHOOSING A DOG IS OWNER AS BIG A LIFE DECISION AS GETTING 
MARRIED OR HAVING BABIES CHOOSING CHOOSING A DOG IS LIKE CHOOSING A PARTNER 
LOOKS DO COME INTO IT THE DOG HAS 
TO APPEAL TO YOU PHYSICALLY BUT 
MORE IMPORTANTLY IS DOES THE 
PERSONALITY SUIT THAT OF YOURS 
BECAUSE A DOG IS FOR LIFE KEITH KEITH BELIEVES HE CAN ASSESS A DOG'S 
CHARACTER THROUGH HIS EXPERIENCE 
AND TESTS 
ONE SHOW VIEWERS VERONICA AND BRYN 
FROM COUNTY DOWN NORTHERN IRELAND 
WOULD LOVE A DOG BUT WOULD IT FIT 
INTO THEIR BUSY LIVES 
WHY DO YOU 
WANT A DOG 
I HAVE ALWAYS HAD DOGS 
FROM WHEN I WAS A BABY MY FAMILY 
ALWAYS HAD 
A DOG L. JUST THINK IT'S A BIT OF COMPANY WHENEVER HE'S AWAY 
WHAT ABOUT YOU WHAT SORT OF DOG 
WOULD YOU LIKE 
I WOULD TEND TO 
FOR A SLIGHTLY LARGER DOG L. LIKE 
DOGS LIKE A NOREN ELKHOUND 
JAPANESE AKITAS 
TRAINING A DOG IS 
AN ONGOING PROCESS WHEN BRYN IS 
AWAY FOR THE WEEKEND AND YOU'RE 
CALLED AWAY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO 
DO WITH THE DOG 
WELL I HAVE GOOD 
NEIGHBOURS AND I HAVE MY MUM AND 
BRYN'S MUM 
DO YOU THINK THAT'S THE 
ANSWER DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR TO 
BRING A DOG INTO A HOME WHEN YOUR 
WORK TAKES YOU AWAY AND YOU HAVE TO 
HAVE SOMEONE ELSE LOOK AFTER HIM I I THINK IT'S MORE FAIR TO GIVE A DOG 
THAT THAN FOR A DOG TO BE IN A CAGE 
IN A RESCUE HOME 
HOW LONG ARE 
YOU'S MARRIED 
NEARLY THREE YEARS 
IT'S JUST NOW YOU HAVE GOT THIS 
BEAUTIFUL HOME AND YOU FEEL THE 
TIME IS RIGHT FOR ANOTHER DOG IS 
THAT RIGHT 
SO WHAT ARE YOU GETTING 
AT 
BASICALLY READING BETWEEN THE AT LINES AND SPEAKING AS A FATHER AND 
A HUSBAND IF YOU ASK ME I THINK 
VERONICA IS GETTING A LITTLE BIT 
BROODDY AND I DON'T THINK THE TIME 
IS RIGHT THEN TO BRING A DOG IN 
AS A SUBSTITUTE CHILD 
M. M. M. L. CAN 
SEE YOUR POINTS BUT I I DO THINK 
A DOG IS EASIER THAN A BABY L. AM 
NOT READY FOR BABIES YET WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND 
MY ADVICE IS 
TO GET THE NEST BUILDING OUT OF THE 
WAY AND WHEN THE KIDS ARE PAST 
TODDLER STAGE THEN YOU LOOK AT 
BRINGING A DOG INTO THE HOME SO SO THEY DECIDE TO TAKE KEITH'S ADVICE 
THEIR BUSY LIFESTYLE MEANS THEY 
SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO LOOK 
AFTER A DOG PROPERLY BUT IF YOU 
CAN DEDICATE THE TIME TO RAISE A 
DOG AND YOU WANT A PUPPY THEN 
KEITH HAS SOME GREAT ADVICE 
WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO BUY A 
PUPPY 
WHEN YOU HAVE DECIDED ON THE PUPPY BREED THAT YOU FEEL WILL SUIT YOU 
YOU KNOW THE FIRST THING YOU COULD 
DO IS CONTACT MAYBE THE KENNEL CLUB 
OR WORD OF MOUTH OR YOUR LOCAL 
VETERINARY SURGERY AND THEY'LL PUT 
YOU IN TOUCH WITH A BREEDER ONCE 
YOU HAVE DECIDED ON THE BREED AND 
YOU HAVE DONE A BIT OF RESEARCH AND 
YOU FIND SOMEONE THAT IS RECOGNISED 
AS A REPUTABLE BREEDER ALWAYS GO 
TO WHERE THE PUPPIES HAVE BEEN 
REARED AND YOU SHOULD ALWAYS SEE 
THE PUPPYS WITH THE MOTHER 
WE HAVE 
THE MOTHER HERE WITH THESE TWO SHE SHE MAY HAVE BEEN WEANED AWAY FROM THE 
PUPPIES BUT YOU CAN ASSESS THE 
MOTHER'S TEMPERAMENT AND THAT'LL 
GIVE YOU AN INDICATION OF WHAT WAY 
THE PUPPIES WILL BE WHEN THEY GROW 
UP 
WHAT OTHER ADVICE WOULD YOU UP GIVE 
IF YOU HAVE SELECTED A GIVE PEDIGREE DOG A LOT OF PEDIGREE 
DOGS ARE PRONE TO A LOT OF LET 
AILMENTS WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST TO 
PEOPLE IN THAT INSTANCE IS TO 
CONTACT THE KENNEL CLUB AND GET A 
LIST OF WHAT PROBLEMS ARE 
ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN BREEDS AND 
REALISTICALLY YOU SHOULDN'T BE 
TAKING A PUPPY AWAY FROM A LITTER 
BEFORE EIGHT WEEKS OLD 
HOW DO YOU 
CHOOSE WHICH PUPPY FROM A LITTER 
YOU SHOULD GET 
IF YOU'RE A FIRST 
TIME DOG OWNER PEOPLE ARE OFTEN 
ATTRACTED TO THE NICE CONFIDENT 
COCKY PUP THAT MIGHT BE AN 
INDEPENDENT DIFFICULT PUP FOR YOU 
TO TRAIN REALLY THE BEST ADVICE 
IS THE IN BETWEEN ONE NOT TOO SHY 
NOT TOO COCKY FOR A FIRST TIME 
OWNER GREAT OWNER GREAT KEITH A DOG MATCHER WHO LIKES TO 
SAY NO AND WHY NOT 
HE CLEARLY BELIEVES A BIG DOG IS 
NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR LITTLE CHILD 
HE MADE THAT VERY CLEAR IN FACT 
BUT THE TWO CAN HAPPILY COEXIST 
YOU CAN SEE PERFECT HARMONY BETWEEN 
DOG AND CHILD IN THIS CLIP WE FOUND 
ON THE INTERNET IT'S CALLED BABY 
LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY AT GIANT 
NEWFOUNDLAND DOG 
THAT'S PRECISELY 
WHAT IT SHOWS 
FANTASTIC TERRY YOU'RE A DOG 
LOVER AREN'T YOU 
OH YES WE HAVE 
TWO SPRINGERS YEAH 
YOU OBVIOUSLY 
DIDN'T ASK KEITH'S ADVICE OR YOU 
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO KEEP 
THEM BUT WE SEE YOU WITH YOUR DOGS 
THERE 
THEY SAY DOGS LOOK LIKE THERE THEIR OWNERS IN CASE THERE IS 
DOUBT ABOUT IT THAT WAS ME IN THE 
MIDDLE 
WERE YOU MATCHED WITH THEM MIDDLE I HAVE TO CONFESS MY WIFE IS THE 
ONE WHO REALLY TAKES CARE OF THEM 
DOGS KEEP YOU FIT WHEN WE'RE 
TALKING ABOUT WEIGHT SHE WALKS 
THEM TWICE DAY AND SHE'S 
AS FIT AS A FIDDLE 
FANTASTIC IS THAT 
LITTLE BABY STILL LAUGHING AT THAT 
NEWFOUNDLAND

DENOUEMENT TO THAT CLIP BUT THE
