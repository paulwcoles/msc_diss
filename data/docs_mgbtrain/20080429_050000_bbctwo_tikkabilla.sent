DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS 
AHH OH LA LA

HELLO I DO KNOW WHAT IT IS IT'S AN UMBRELLA 
THAT'S RIGHT DID YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS 
UMBRELLAS ARE GREAT THEY COME IN DIFFERENT COLOURS SHAPES AND SIZES

AND WHEN I OPEN THIS 
IT'S GOT DUCK FEATHERS INSIDE BEAUTIFUL 
WOW THAT'S LOVELY 
THIS IS A MULTI COLOURED UMBRELLA IT HAS LOTS OF COLOURS 
IT'S GOT BLUE AND RED AND YELLOW AND GREEN 
AND RED AND BLUE AND IT JUST KEEPS GOING ROUND AND ROUND 
UMBRELLAS KEEP THE RAIN OFF US WHEN IT'S RAINING 
THEY CAN DO THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE MADE IN A SPECIAL WAY 
THEY HAVE METAL RIBS THAT FAN OUT AND THEY'RE COVERED 
IN WATERPROOF MATERIAL THAT SLOPES DOWN 
SO THE RAIN RUNS OFF THE TOP AND WE STAY DRY 
I'VE GOT A TINY LITTLE UMBRELLA 
OH YOU DO DON'T YOU TAMBA IT'S LOVELY 
IF IT WAS RAINING I DON'T THINK IT WOULD KEEP YOUR HEAD DRY AT ALL 
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT 
SOMETIMES IN THE SUMMERTIME WHEN IT'S WARM OUTSIDE 
YOU MIGHT NEED AN UMBRELLA A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS D. A. RA 
LOOK AT THAT 
WOW THAT'S THE BIGGEST UMBRELLA I'VE EVER SEEN 
SO WHEN IT'S RAINING WE NEED AN UMBRELLA 
AND WHEN IT'S SUNNY WE NEED AN UMBRELLA TOO 
WHEN THE SUN COMES OUT IT SHINES ON EVERYONE 
WHEN THE SUN COMES OUT IT SHINES ON EVERYONE 
WHEN THE SUN COMES OUT WE ALL HAVE LOTS OF FUN 
OH THE SUN IS PART OF THE WEATHER 
WHEN THE CLOUDS APPEAR THEY COVER UP THE SUN 
WHEN THE CLOUDS APPEAR THEY COVER UP THE SUN 
WHEN THE CLOUDS APPEAR SUNNY DAYS ARE GONE 
OH THE CLOUDS ARE PART OF THE WEATHER 
WHEN THE RAIN COMES DOWN IT TUMBLES FROM THE CLOUDS 
WHEN THE RAIN COMES DOWN IT TUMBLES FROM THE CLOUDS 
WHEN THE RAIN COMES DOWN IT'S TIME TO SHOUT OUT LOUD 
OH THE RAIN IS PART OF THE WEATHER 
WHEN THE THUNDER CRACKS IT ECHOES IN THE RAIN 
WHEN THE THUNDER CRACKS IT ECHOES IN THE RAIN 
WHEN THE THUNDER CRACKS IT RATTLES WINDOW PANES 
OH THE THUNDER'S PART OF THE WEATHER 
WHEN THE WIND BLOWS STRONG THE THUNDER RUNS AWAY 
WHEN THE WIND BLOWS STRONG THE THUNDER RUNS AWAY 
WHEN THE WIND BLOWS STRONG THIS IS WHAT WE SAY 
OH THE WIND IS PART OF THE WEATHER 
THEN THE SUN COMES OUT AND SHINES ON EVERYONE

AND THE THUNDER'S PART 
AND THE RAIN IS PART 
AND THE CLOUDS ARE PART 
YES THEY'RE ALL A PART OF THE WEATHER 
GREAT 
SO MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF WEATHER 
THIS IS A WEATHER CHART 
A WEATHER CHART IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE A CALENDAR 
PEOPLE USE IT TO SHOW WHAT THE WEATHER IS LIKE OUTSIDE 
ON THIS WEATHER CHART THERE'S A PICTURE OF THE SUNSHINE 
IF IT WAS RAINING YOU COULD USE A RAINY PICTURE LIKE THIS 
IF IT WAS THUNDER AND LIGHTNING YOU COULD USE THIS PICTURE HERE 
I'VE USED WOOL THERE AND TIN FOIL 
OR IF IT'S CLOUDY YOU CAN USE SOME COTTON WOOL 
IT LOOKS A BIT LIKE THE CLOUDS 
SHALL WE MAKE A SUNSHINE PICTURE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
I'LL TAKE MY WEATHER CHART HERE 
I'M GOING TO USE SOME LIGHT BLUE CARD WHICH IS PERFECT 
FOR THE SKY COLOUR 
I'LL PUT THAT THERE THEN I'LL USE SOME GLUE 
SOME STICKY STICKY GLUE 
I'M GOING TO PUT A BLOB IN THE MIDDLE 
THEN I'M GOING TO SPREAD SOME ALL THE WAY ROUND LIKE THIS 
BECAUSE THESE ARE GOING TO BE USED FOR THE RAYS OF THE SUN 
I'VE GOT SOME BRIGHT YELLOW RIBBONS WHICH I'VE CUT INTO PIECES 
WHICH WILL BE JUST RIGHT FOR THAT THERE WE ARE 
WHEN THE SUN COMES OUT 
IT SHINES ON EVERYONE

AND SOME BITS FOR THE RAIN 
WE'LL PUT OUR CLOUD IN THE MIDDLE 
THEN WE MAKE OUR RAIN BY TAKING THESE PIECES OF CUT UP TISSUE PAPER 
AND FOLDING THEM LIKE THAT 
KIND OF SCREWING THEM UP LENGTHWAYS 
SO IT LOOKS A BIT LIKE THE RAIN 
LOOK AT THAT 
WHEN THE RAIN COMES DOWN IT TUMBLES FROM THE CLOUDS 
WHEN THE RAIN COMES DOWN IT TUMBLES FROM THE CLOUDS 
WHEN THE RAIN COMES DOWN IT'S TIME TO SHOUT OUT LOUD

IF YOU WANT TO HANG UP YOUR WEATHER CHART 
YOU CAN USE SOME WOOL LIKE I HAVE I'VE GOT SOME LOVELY WOOL HERE 
IT'S A BIT LIKE A RAINBOW ALL THE DIFFERENT COLOURS 
RAINBOWS ARE PART OF THE WEATHER 
I'VE GOT SOME TAPE TO STICK IT ON THE BACK 
A RAINBOW APPEARS IN THE SKY WHEN THE SUN AND THE RAIN 
BOTH COME OUT AT THE SAME TIME AND THEY'RE VERY BEAUTIFUL 
WE CAN HANG OUR WEATHER CHART ON THE BACK OF THE TIKKABILLA DOOR 
YOU CAN MAKE A WEATHER CHART AND HANG IT UP NEAR A WINDOW 
WHEN YOU LOOK OUT YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE WEATHER IS LIKE 
AH 
I KNOW WHERE THERE ARE SOME MORE CLOUDS 
BUT INSIDE THE TIKKABILLA HOUSE 
AND WHEN THE SUN COMES OUT 
WE CAN SEE WHAT TIME IT IS ON THE TIKKABILLA CLOCK 
TIKKABILLA TOCKABILLA 
TIKKABILLA TOCK 
WHAT'S THE TIME ON THE TIKKABILLA CLOCK 
THE LONG HAND IS POINTING UP TO THE NUMBER TWELVE 
SO THAT MEANS IT'S SOMETHING O'CLOCK 
AND THE SHORT HAND IS POINTING TO THE NUMBER TWO 
SO THE CLOCK SAYS IT'S TWO O'CLOCK 
BUT WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE TIKKABILLA CLOCK 
IT'S SOME LIGHTNING AND THERE'S SOME STORMY WEATHER IN TODAY'S STORY 
TODAY'S STORY IS CALLED THE DANCE OF THE DINOSAURS 
LIGHTNING FLASHED ON A WILD AND STORMY NIGHT 
AND GEORGIE AND DEE SHIVERED IN FRIGHT 
COME ON SAID CAT DON'T BE AFRAID 
I'LL SHOW YOU BOTH HOW A STORM IS MADE 
AS THE THUNDER ROARED AND RUMBLED 
DOWN THE STAIRS AFTER CAT THEY TUMBLED 
WHERE ARE WE GOING CRIED GEORGIE TO DEE 
HURRY CALLED CAT WAIT AND SEE 
MEOW THEY CHASED DOWN THE GARDEN AFTER CAT 
THE WIND LASHED THE TREES THIS WAY AND THAT 
LOOK YELLED DEE THERE'S A BALLOON 
BE QUICK CALLED CAT IT'S GOING SOON 
THEY JUMPED ABOARD JUST IN TIME 
AS HIGHER AND HIGHER THEY STARTED TO CLIMB 
CAT SAILED THE BALLOON THROUGH THE DARK NIGHT 
THEN A STRANGE LAND CAME INTO SIGHT 
DOWN THEY FLEW THROUGH THE RAGING SKY 
GREAT FLYING LIZARDS WENT SWOOPING BY 
LOOK CRIED DEE AT THOSE BEAKS AND CLAWS 
AND GEORGIE YELLED THEY'RE DINOSAURS 
AS THE BALLOON LANDED ON THE GROUND 
ENORMOUS DINOSAURS LUMBERED AROUND 
OH SAID GEORGIE I DON'T LIKE IT HERE 
COME ON SAID CAT THERE'S NOTHING TO FEAR 
FOLLOW ME GRINNED CAT DON'T BE AFRAID 
NOW THIS IS HOW A STORM IS MADE 
THE DANCE OF THE DINOSAURS HAD BEGUN 
SO THEY ALL JOINED IN TO HAVE SOME FUN 
ACROSS THE WIDE DESERT THE DINOSAURS STOMPED 
OVER THE SAND THEY ROARED AND ROMPED 
THEN GEORGIE AND DEE AND CAT TOO 
ALL DANCED TOGETHER IN THE HULLABALOO 
JAWS CLASHED CLAWS FLASHED 
FASTER AND FASTER FEET CRASHED 
OVER THE VOLCANO THE DINOSAURS JUMPED THEY THUNDERED AND THUMPED 
JAWS CLASHED CLAWS FLASHED 
LOUDER AND LOUDER FEET SMASHED 
THE LAND SHOOK WITH FEARSOME ROARS THIS IS THE DANCE OF THE DINOSAURS 
SUDDENLY DOWN THEY ALL TUMBLED INTO A PILE 
THE STORM IS OVER WHISPERED CAT WITH A SMILE 
I'M TIRED YAWNED GEORGIE IS IT TIME FOR BED 
AND EVERYONE NODDED THEIR SLEEPY HEAD 
THEN ALL THE DINOSAURS WAVED GOODBYE 
AND OFF THEY SAILED ACROSS THE STARRY SKY 
THROUGH THE HUSH OF THE PEACEFUL NIGHT 
HOMEWARDS THEY FLEW IN THE TWINKLING LIGHT 
LOOK SAID CAT WE'VE NOT FAR TO GO 
AND THEY SAW THEIR HOUSE FAR BELOW 
BACK THEY DRIFTED OVER WHISPERING TREES 
AND LANDED SOFTLY IN THE GENTLE BREEZE 
BE QUIET SAID CAT AS IN THEY HURRIED 
THEN QUICKLY BACK UP THE STAIRS THEY SCURRIED 
INTO THEIR SOFT BEDS THEY QUIETLY CREPT 
AND SOON GEORGIE AND DEE AND CAT THEY SLEPT 
AND FAR FAR AWAY THE DINOSAURS DREAMT 
UNDER THE STARLIGHT OF ANOTHER DANCE ON ANOTHER NIGHT 
WHEN THE DINOSAURS DANCED IN OUR STORY 
THEY MADE THUNDER AND LIGHTNING
