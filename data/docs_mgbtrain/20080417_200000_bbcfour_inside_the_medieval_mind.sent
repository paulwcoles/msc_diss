TO THE EARLY MEDIEVAL MIND THE WORLD COULD APPEAR MYSTERIOUS EVEN ENCHANTED 
WHAT SHOULD YOU BELIEVE ABOUT THE DOG HEADS 
ARE THEY DESCENDED FROM ADAM'S STOCK 
OR DO THEY HAVE THE SOUL OF ANIMALS 
BEHIND THE WONDER WAS A FAITH THAT THE WORLD WAS DIVINELY ORDERED 
EVERY CREATURE IN THE WORLD IS A BOOK OR A MIRROR FOR US 
BUT IN TIME THAT FAITH WOULD BE SHAKEN BY AN EXTRAORDINARY CULTURAL REVOLUTION 
A REVOLUTION IN THE WAY WE THINK 
IN THE WAY WE ANALYSE THE PHYSICAL WORLD 
AND IN OUR EXPERIENCE OF OTHER CONTINENTS AND CULTURES 
THE SUM OF EUROPEAN KNOWLEDGE 
AND THE CHRISTIAN BELIEF IT WAS BASED ON 
THE WAY WE UNDERSTAND THE WORLD 
HOW IT WAS MADE AND WHEN IT CAME INTO BEING 
WAS ABOUT TO BE TRANSFORMED 
THE WORLD BETWEEN THE NINTH AND FIFTEENTH CENTURIES 
SUPPOSEDLY A PERIOD OF SUPERSTITION AND IGNORANCE 
WHERE IDEAS ARE STIFLED BY THE DEAD HAND OF RELIGION 
THE INTELLECTUAL LANDSCAPE OF THE MIDDLE AGES IS CERTAINLY UNFAMILIAR EVEN STRANGE 
FROM FURIOUS DEBATES ABOUT ARCANE POINTS OF THEOLOGY 
TO REPORTED SIGHTINGS OF PEOPLE WITH THE HEADS OF DOGS 
BUT BEHIND ALL THIS STRANGENESS LIES A WORLD OF PASSIONATE ENQUIRY 
THERE'S SCHOLARSHIP SCIENCE INTELLECTUAL EXPLORATION AND SOPHISTICATED LOGIC 
THE WORLD EXPERIENCED BY MEDIEVAL MEN AND WOMEN WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM OUR OWN 
EVENTS THAT MIGHT BE CALLED SUPERNATURAL 
OCCUR FREQUENTLY IN MEDIEVAL RECORDS 
AT THE END OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY RALPH THE RESPECTED ABBOT OF THE MONASTERY OF COGGESHALL 
RECORDED AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY INVOLVING THE CAPTURE OF A WILD MAN WHO LIVED IN THE SEA 
IT HAPPENED THAT THE FISHERMEN THERE FISHING OUT IN THE SEA CAUGHT 
A WILD MAN IN THEIR NETS THEY BROUGHT HIM TO THE CASTLE AS A WONDER 
HE WAS NAKED AND PRESENTED A HUMAN APPEARANCE IN EVERY PART OF HIS BODY 
WHEN TAKEN TO CHURCH HE SHOWED NO SIGNS OF REVERENCE OR BELIEF 
HOWEVER OFTEN HE SAW HOLY THINGS 
HE DID NOT WISH TO UTTER A WORD EVEN WHEN HUNG BY THE FEET AND SUBJECT TO DIRE AND FREQUENT TORTURE 
WHAT'S STRIKING TO US TODAY ABOUT THIS STRANGE AND RATHER SAD TALE 
IS THAT THE ABBOT IS LESS CONCERNED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE STORY IS TRUE 
THAN TO WORK OUT EXACTLY WHAT CATEGORY OF CREATURE THIS MIGHT BE 
WAS HE A MORTAL MAN HE ASKED OR SOME FISH IN HUMAN FORM 
OR A WICKED SPIRIT LURKING IN THE BODY OF A DROWNED MAN 
THE WILD MAN EVENTUALLY ESCAPED BACK TO THE SEA 
HIS TORMENTORS AND RALPH OF COGGESHALL 
ARE LEFT WONDERING WHAT KIND OF CREATURE THIS WAS AND WERE THERE OTHERS LIKE HIM SHARING THEIR WORLD 
MEDIEVAL RECORDS ARE BRIMFUL OF STORIES OF SIGHTINGS OF STRANGE CREATURES 
SHE HAD COME FROM AN UNDERGROUND WORLD WHERE THE INHABITANTS 
WERE AS GREEN AS GRASS AND NEVER SAW THE SUN BUT WERE LIT BY A TWILIGHT GLOW 
DURING THE REIGN OF HENRY THE SECOND A SERVANT CALLED RICHARD FROM NORTH SUNDERLAND MET WITH THREE YOUNG MEN 
DRESSED IN GREEN ON GREEN HORSES WHO CARRIED HIM OFF TO A LOFTY MANSION 
HERE THEY ATE OATEN BREAD AND DRANK MILK 
THESE STORIES WERE NOT REGARDED AS FOLKLORE 
BUT AS REPORTED SUBSTANTIATED FACTS 
THE CHRONICLER GERVASE OF TILBURY IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY REPORTED HUNDREDS OF SUCH SIGHTINGS 
ONE CONCERNED THE CONGREGATION OF A NORFOLK CHURCH WHO SAW AN ANCHOR HANGING FROM THE SKY 
THE ANCHOR WAS CAUGHT ON A TOMBSTONE 
ATTACHED TO IT AND LEADING UP INTO THE CLOUDS WAS A HEAVY CHAIN 
ALL OF A SUDDEN A SAILOR APPEARED FROM THE CLOUD 
CLIMBING DOWN THE CHAIN HAND BY HAND USING THE SAME TECHNIQUE AS WE DO 
HE WAS SEIZED BY THE CHURCHGOERS 
THE OTHER WORLD SAILOR SUFFOCATED BY THE MOISTNESS OF OUR DENSER AIR AND DIED IN THEIR GRASP 
HE WAS HUMAN ENOUGH TO SAIL A SHIP BUT COULD BREATHE ONLY THE AIR ABOVE THE CLOUDS 
WHAT KIND OF BEING WAS HE 
CONFOUNDED BY THE SHEER NUMBER OF SUCH DISCOVERIES 
MEDIEVAL THINKERS TURNED TO THE MOST AUTHORITATIVE GUIDES THEY HAD 
THE BIBLE AND THE TEACHINGS OF THE CHURCH 
ACCORDING TO MEDIEVAL THINKING ALL LIVING THINGS BELONGED 
TO ONE OF THREE CATEGORIES ANIMALS HUMANS AND SPIRIT BEINGS 
THAT IS ANGELS AND DEMONS 
THE CREATURES DESCRIBED BY GERVASE OF TILBURY APPEAR TO DEFY ALL THREE CATEGORIES 
IF THE BEINGS WHO APPEARED ON OUR DOORSTEP SEEMED STRANGE 
THE WORLD BEYOND THE SHORES OF BRITAIN WERE STRANGER STILL 
A SENSE OF JUST HOW ENCHANTED IT WAS CAN BE FOUND AMONGST THE TREASURES OF HEREFORD CATHEDRAL 
THIS IS THE HEREFORD MAPPA MUNDI WHICH MEANS MAP OF THE WORLD 
IT WAS PRODUCED AROUND ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND IT'S ONE OF THE OLDEST BIGGEST AND MOST ELABORATE DEPICTIONS 
OF THE PHYSICAL EARTH TO HAVE SURVIVED FROM THE MIDDLE AGES 
IT WAS MADE FROM THE SKIN OF A SINGLE CALF 
THE HEAD WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE THE TAIL HERE THE FORELEGS 
AND WHAT IT SHOWS IS THE THREE CONTINENTS KNOWN TO MEDIEVAL GEOGRAPHY 
EAST WAS AT THE TOP 
HERE WAS ASIA 
AFRICA AND EUROPE 
AND IN THE CENTRE SYMBOLICALLY WAS THE CITY OF JERUSALEM 
MANY TOWNS AND CITIES RIVERS AND SEAS ARE ACCURATELY MARKED 
HERE THE RED SEA HAS BEEN GIVEN A VERY LITERAL INTERPRETATION 
BUT UNDERSTANDING THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE WORLD WAS NOT THE SOLE POINT OF SUCH MAPS 
THIS MAP WAS CERTAINLY NOT DESIGNED TO GET YOU FROM A TO B. 
BUT IT DOES SHOW HOW PEOPLE AT THE TIME PICTURED THE EARTH 
ON THE BASIS OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THEM 
IT'S COVERED WITH DRAWINGS 
SOME OF THEM RATHER FAMILIAR 
RUSSIA IS REPRESENTED BY A BEAR 
NORWAY BY A MAN ON SKIS 
THE MAP IS LABELLED AS A HISTORY OR STORY 
AND IT DOES SEEM TO DEPICT TIME AS WELL AS SPACE 
ABOVE JERUSALEM THE CRUCIFIXION IS TAKING PLACE 
OUT HERE WE HAVE THE GOLDEN FLEECE 
AND AT THE TOP ADAM AND EVE ARE BEING EXPELLED 
FROM THE GARDEN OF EDEN 
ABOVE THEM WE SEE THE FUTURE 
THE LAST JUDGMENT 
THE SOULS HERE ARE BEING RECEIVED BY GOD THE FATHER 
WHILE THE DAMNED ARE BEING LED OFF TO THE MOUTH OF HELL 
THE OBSERVABLE WORLD AND THE WORLD OF DIVINE REVELATION 
THE NATURAL AND THE SUPERNATURAL COEXIST QUITE COMFORTABLY 
IN EUROPE MANY WELL KNOWN CITIES ARE REPRESENTED 
INCLUDING THE MOST IMPORTANT ROME PARIS SAINT ANDREWS 
BUT AS ONE MOVES FURTHER AWAY FROM EUROPE THE WORLD BECOMES STRANGER AND THERE ARE STRANGER CREATURES 
MERMAIDS 
UNICORNS 
MEN WITH THEIR FACES IN THEIR CHESTS 
THE MONOPODS CREATURES WITH ONE GIANT FOOT 
THAT WHEN THEY LAY BACKWARDS THEY COULD USE AS AN UMBRELLA 
THE FURTHER AWAY WE GET FROM THE FAMILIAR WORLD AROUND US 
THE MORE EXOTIC AND FANTASTIC CREATURES BECOME 
THIS WAS NOT JUST SOME FANCIFUL IMAGINING BY THE MAP'S CREATOR 
THESE CREATURES WERE KNOWN TO HAVE LIVED IN FAR OFF LANDS 
AND THEY PRESENTED THE MEDIEVAL THINKER WITH SOME REALLY PRESSING QUESTIONS 
WHAT KIND OF CREATURE WERE THEY AND HOW SHOULD YOU DEAL WITH THEM 
SOMEWHERE ON THE FRINGES OF THE WORLD LIVED A RACE OF DOG HEADED MEN 
SUCH CREATURES APPEAR QUITE FREQUENTLY IN MEDIEVAL TEXTS AND ILLUSTRATIONS 
THESE BEINGS APPEARED TO BE HUMAN IN MOST RESPECTS EXCEPT THAT THEY HAD THE HEADS OF DOGS 
THE QUESTION WAS DID THEY HAVE THE SOULS OF HUMANS 
THIS WAS A PRACTICAL CONCERN FOR MISSIONARIES 
IF THEY ENCOUNTERED DOG HEADS SHOULD THEY PREACH TO THEM OR NOT 
AFTER ALL IT MADE NO SENSE TO PREACH TO ANIMALS BUT IT WAS EVERY CHRISTIAN'S DUTY 
TO CONVERT HUMAN SOULS TO CHRIST 
HOWEVER BIZARRE THE BODY IN WHICH THAT HUMAN SOUL WAS ENCASED 
JUST SUCH A QUESTION PUZZLED A YOUNG MISSIONARY IN THE NINTH CENTURY AS HE PREPARED FOR A TRIP TO SCANDINAVIA 
HE SOUGHT THE ADVICE OF A LEADING SCHOLAR OF THE TIME NAMED RATRAMNUS 
WHAT SHOULD YOU BELIEVE ABOUT THE DOG HEADS 
ARE THEY DESCENDED FROM ADAM'S STOCK OR DO THEY HAVE THE SOUL OF ANIMALS 
RATRAMNUS'S ADVICE IS VERY REVEALING 
FIRST HE ASSERTS THAT IF THE DOG HEADS ARE DESCENDED FROM ADAM THEY ARE CERTAINLY HUMAN 
ADMITTEDLY THE SHAPE OF THEIR HEADS AND THEIR BARKING ARE AGAINST THEM 
BUT NEVERTHELESS THEY SHOW MANY CRUCIAL HUMAN ATTRIBUTES 
THEY LIVED IN VILLAGES 
THEY FARMED THE LAND AND KEPT DOMESTICATED ANIMALS 
MOREOVER THE FACT THAT THE DOG HEADS COVER THEIR GENITALIA 
IS A SIGN OF THEIR DECENCY 
WHICH IN TURN MEANS THEY HAVE THE POWER OF JUDGING BETWEEN THE DECENT AND THE INDECENT 
FOR THE SCHOLAR RATRAMNUS THIS IS A POWERFUL POINT 
I DO NOT SEE HOW THIS COULD BE 
IF THEY HAD AN ANIMAL AND NOT A RATIONAL SOUL 
FOR NO ONE CAN BLUSH AT INDECENCY UNLESS THEY HAVE A CERTAIN RECOGNITION OF DECENCY 
A GROUP OF MORAL RATIONAL BEINGS LIVING IN A SOCIETY BOUND BY LAWS 
THIS IS HUMANITY NOT MERE ANIMALITY 
THEREFORE HE CONCLUDES DOG HEADS WERE IN ESSENCE HUMAN BEINGS 
SOME REPORTEDLY ADOPTED CHRISTIANITY 
ONE EVEN BECAME A SAINT 
ACCORDING TO SOME SAINT CHRISTOPHER THE PATRON SAINT OF TRAVELLERS WAS ONE SUCH CREATURE 
THERE WERE OF COURSE NO EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS OF THESE CREATURES AND THEY WERE NEVER SEEN IN BRITAIN 
IT IS IN FACT THE VERY NATURE OF A DOG HEAD ALWAYS TO BE SOMEWHERE ELSE 
IT'S EASY TO POKE FUN AT THIS EARNEST PHILOSOPHISING 
ABOUT SUCH BIZARRE CREATURES AS DOG HEADS AND FISH MEN AND PEOPLE WHO COME DOWN FROM THE SKY 
BUT SUCH DEBATES WERE PURSUED WITH KEEN LOGIC AND AN IMPRESSIVE SPIRIT OF DEDICATION 
LOGIC AND OBSERVATION WERE THE TOOLS WHEREBY THINGS WERE MADE TO FIND 
THEIR PLACE IN A WORLD VIEW THAT WAS INTENSELY RELIGIOUS 
AND THE FIT WAS NOT ALWAYS A NEAT ONE 
FOR MUCH OF THE MIDDLE AGES PEOPLE BELIEVED THINGS THAT TODAY MIGHT STRIKE US AS PARADOXICAL 
TO THE MEDIEVAL MIND AN EVENT COULD BE BOTH NATURAL AND SUPERNATURAL 
THE GREAT ECCLESIASTIC HRABANUS MAURUS 
RECORDED HOW PEOPLE REACTED TO AN ECLIPSE IN THE NINTH CENTURY 
I SAW PEOPLE SHOOTING SPEARS AND ARROWS AT THE MOON 
OR SCATTERING THE FIRES FROM THEIR HEARTHS INTO THE AIR 
I HEARD THE BELLOWING OF WARLIKE HORNS 
THE MOON THE PEOPLE SAID WAS BEING ATTACKED BY MONSTERS 
AND UNLESS THEY BROUGHT HELP THE MONSTERS WOULD DEVOUR HER 
BUT IT WASN'T ONLY THE IGNORANT WHO REACTED IN THIS WAY 
AMONGST SCHOLARS TOO IT WAS WIDELY BELIEVED THAT ECLIPSES MEANT SOMETHING 
THEY SIGNIFIED DIVINE INTERVENTION OF SOME KIND 
IN FACT A COMMON MEDIEVAL TERM FOR AN ECLIPSE WAS SIGNUM A SIGN 
IT WOULD BE WRONG TO REGARD THE INTERPRETATION OF ECLIPSES AS DIVINE SIGNS 
AS STEMMING FROM IGNORANCE OF THEIR PHYSICAL CAUSES 
HERE IS ISIDORE OF SEVILLE THE GREAT ENCYCLOPAEDIST OF THE EARLY MIDDLE AGES 
HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
THE MOON SUFFERS AN ECLIPSE 
IF THE SHADOW OF THE EARTH COMES BETWEEN IT AND THE SUN 
THE SUN SUFFERS AN ECLIPSE WHEN THE NEW MOON IS IN LINE WITH THE SUN 
AND OBSTRUCTS AND OBSCURES IT 
HE WAS OF COURSE RIGHT 
SO WERE ECLIPSES DIVINE MESSAGES OR NATURAL PHENOMENA 
THEY WERE BOTH 
THE TWO EXPLANATIONS COULD COEXIST 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN OLIVER OF PADERBON A CHRONICLER AT THE TIME DESCRIBED 
HOW TROOPS ON THE MARCH SAW A FAVOURABLE SIGN IN THE NIGHT SKY 
SOON AFTER WE ARRIVED THERE WAS AN ALMOST TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE MOON 
THIS OFTEN HAPPENS FROM NATURAL CAUSES AT THE TIME OF THE FULL MOON 
NEVERTHELESS SINCE THE LORD SAYS THERE SHALL BE SIGNS IN THE SUN 
AND IN THE MOON WE INTERPRETED THIS ECLIPSE AS UNFAVOURABLE TO THE ENEMY 
THE ECLIPSE WAS INTERPRETED AS A SIGN FROM GOD 
EVEN THOUGH ITS NATURAL CAUSE WAS ALSO RECOGNISED 
THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY WELL THE PHYSICAL PROCESSES OF AN EVENT LIKE AN ECLIPSE 
WHILE REMAINING CONVINCED OF ITS RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE IS A CLASSIC FEATURE OF MEDIEVAL THINKING 
WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED THE DISENCHANTMENT OF THE WORLD WAS ONLY JUST BEGINNING 
PHYSICAL LAWS AND DIVINE AGENCY WERE YET TO QUARREL 
IN THE MEDIEVAL WORLD VIEW 
THE DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND BURNED WITH A MORAL INTENSITY 
IN THE EARLY MIDDLE AGES THE QUEST FOR KNOWLEDGE WAS LARGELY CONFINED 
WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE GREAT MONASTERIES AND CATHEDRALS 
LEARNING STAYED IN THE HANDS OF MONKS AND PRIESTS QUITE LITERALLY 
MEDIEVAL EUROPE WAS A MANUSCRIPT CULTURE WHICH MEANS THAT FOR A TEXT 
TO EXIST AT ALL IT HAD TO BE COPIED OUT BY HAND 
AND FOR IT TO EXIST IN MORE THAN ONE COPY IT HAD TO BE COPIED OUT AGAIN 
AND AGAIN 
IT WAS A SLOW AND LABORIOUS BUSINESS 
OCCASIONALLY A SMALL VOICE OF PROTEST CAN BE HEARD FROM THE MARGINS 
HERE ENDS THE SECOND PART OF THE SUMMA THEOLOGICA 
VERY LONG VERY VERBOSE AND VERY TEDIOUS TO WRITE OUT 
THANK GOD THANK GOD AND AGAIN THANK GOD 
BOOKS WERE CONSEQUENTLY EXTREMELY VALUABLE AND HIGHLY TREASURED 
IF THEY TRAVELLED AT ALL 
IT WAS USUALLY FROM ONE MONASTERY TO ANOTHER AND IF THEY GOT LOST 
WELL AT LEAST ONE MEDIEVAL LIBRARIAN WAS NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY 
FOR HIM THAT STEALS THIS BOOK OR BORROWS IT AND DOES NOT RETURN IT 
LET IT CHANGE INTO A SERPENT IN HIS HAND AND REND HIM 
LET HIM BE STRUCK WITH PALSY AND ALL HIS LIMBS BLASTED 
LET HIM LANGUISH IN PAIN CRYING ALOUD FOR MERCY 
AND WHEN AT LAST HE GOES TO HIS FINAL PUNISHMENT 
LET THE FLAMES OF HELL CONSUME HIM FOR EVER 
BOOKS WERE RARE PRECIOUS 
AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE FEW 
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MIDDLE AGES LEARNING WAS LOCKED AWAY IN THE HANDS OF MONKS AND PRIESTS 
THEY WERE THE INTERPRETERS OF THE WORLD 
LEARNING WAS NOT SOMETHING TO BE DISSEMINATED SO MUCH AS JEALOUSLY CONTROLLED 
FOR KNOWLEDGE EXISTED NOT FOR ITS OWN SAKE 
BUT AS PART OF THE SEARCH FOR RELIGIOUS TRUTH 
IN THE LIBRARY OF GONVILLE AND CAIUS COLLEGE IN CAMBRIDGE 
ARE MEDIEVAL MANUSCRIPTS WHICH DESCRIBE ANIMALS AND NATURE 
WHAT WE HAVE HERE ARE MEDIEVAL ACCOUNTS OF THE NATURAL WORLD 
A WORLD OF ANIMALS A WORLD OF BIRDS 
A WORLD OF FISH 
SYSTEMATICALLY ARRANGED 
AND OFTEN BEAUTIFULLY AND LAVISHLY ILLUSTRATED 
THEY'RE CALLED BESTIARIES 
AND THEY GIVE US AN INSIGHT INTO HOW PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE AGES RESPONDED TO THE NATURAL WORLD AROUND THEM 
MEDIEVAL THINKERS CARED LESS ABOUT WHAT AN ANIMAL LOOKED LIKE 
OR WHERE IT LIVED THAN ABOUT WHAT ITS NATURE AND CHARACTER 
COULD TELL US ABOUT GOD'S PLAN FOR MANKIND 
TAKE THE STORY OF THE BEAVER 
THE BEAVER THE BESTIARY TELLS US IS HUNTED FOR ITS TESTICLES 
IT DOES INDEED SECRETE VALUABLE MUSK IN THAT REGION 
WHEN THE BEAVER SEES THE HUNTSMEN COMING IT CUTS OFF ITS OWN TESTICLES WITH ITS TEETH 
THEN WAVES ITS LEG SHOWING THE HUNTSMAN THAT IT HAS NOTHING FOR HIM 
IN JUST THIS WAY SAYS THE BESTIARY WE MUST CUT AWAY VICE FROM OURSELVES 
SO THAT WHEN THE DEVIL COMES AFTER US WE CAN SHOW HIM THAT WE HAVE NOTHING FOR HIM 
THE WORLD HAD BEEN CREATED BY GOD IN THE SAME WAY THAT A BOOK IS WRITTEN BY ITS AUTHOR 
THE BESTIARY TEXTS OFTEN BEGIN WITH A LARGE ILLUSTRATION 
OF ADAM GIVING NAMES TO THE ANIMALS 
THEY'VE ASSEMBLED IN A RATHER CHARMING WAY TO HEAR WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE CALLED 
AND IT'S VERY SYMBOLIC BECAUSE IN THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD 
THE NATURAL WORLD WAS NOT VIEWED AS SOMETHING INDEPENDENT IN ITS OWN RIGHT 
IT HAD BEEN CREATED FOR HUMAN BEINGS 
BUT WHETHER THE CREATURES ARE FABULOUS OR REALISTIC 
WHETHER THE BIRD IS A PHOENIX OR A BLACKBIRD 
THE PURPOSE OF THE BESTIARY WAS NOT REALLY TO ACT AS A KIND OF FIELD GUIDE 
ITS PURPOSE WAS TO TELL YOU WHAT THESE CREATURES MEANT 
THEY HAD A MESSAGE FOR HUMAN BEINGS AND THE MESSAGE WAS MORAL AND SPIRITUAL 
A SIMILAR WARNING AGAINST THE WILES OF THE DEVIL 
CAN BE FOUND IN THE STORY OF THE WHALE 
ILLUSTRATED IN THIS OTHER BESTIARY IN A RATHER SPECTACULAR DRAWING 
IN WHICH WE SEE THE SAILORS 
THAT HAVE COME TO WHAT THEY THINK IS AN ISLAND IN THE SEA 
THEY LAND THEY HAMMER IN A STAKE TO ANCHOR THEIR SHIP 
THEY LIGHT A FIRE 
WHAT THEY HAVEN'T REALISED 
IS THAT THE ISLAND IS IN FACT THE HUMP OF A GIANT WHALE 
WHICH IS IMMEDIATELY TO SUCK THEM DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA 
THAT'S A WARNING FOR US TO BE ON OUR GUARD AGAINST THE WILES OF THE DEVIL AND HIS DECEPTIONS AT ALL TIMES 
ACCORDING TO THE PHILOSOPHER ALAN DE LILLE 
EVERY CREATURE IN THE WORLD IS A BOOK OR A PICTURE OR A MIRROR FOR US 
BUT THIS VIEW OF THE EARTH AS A SACRED BOOK WAS BEGINNING TO BE UNDERMINED 
BY CHANGES TAKING PLACE IN THE MEDIEVAL WORLD 
THE GROWTH OF TOWNS ALL OVER EUROPE 
THE UPHEAVALS OF WAR 
THE NEW HORIZONS OPENED UP BY TRADE 
THE GROWING COMPLEXITY OF GOVERNMENT AND LAW 
THE BUREAUCRACY REQUIRED TO RUN A MEDIEVAL STATE WAS GROWING MORE SOPHISTICATED 
WHERE WERE THE LAWYERS AND ADMINISTRATORS TO COME FROM 
A NEW CLASS OF MAN EDUCATED IN A DIFFERENT WAY WAS NEEDED 
A BACKGROUND IN BIBLICAL SCHOLARSHIP WAS NO LONGER ENOUGH 
TUTORS BEGAN TO CONGREGATE IN OXFORD IN THE MID TWELFTH CENTURY 
THEY OFFERED TEACHING IN LAW AND OTHER SECULAR SUBJECTS IN RETURN FOR MONEY 
SETTING THEMSELVES UP IN RENTED ROOMS 
THIS WAS A SMALL REVOLUTION 
YOU COULD NOW PURSUE A CAREER IN LEARNING WITHOUT BEING A MONK OR A PRIEST 
YOUNG BOYS BEGAN TO STUDY NOT NECESSARILY TO BECOME CLOSER TO GOD 
BUT TO INCREASE THEIR CHANCES IN LIFE 
HUNDREDS OF TEENAGE BOYS LIVING AWAY FROM HOME IN A STRANGE PLACE 
RENTING ROOMS BUYING FOOD GOING TO THE PUB INTERESTED IN GIRLS 
IN OTHER WORDS A RECIPE FOR TROUBLE 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINE THE BODY OF A LOCAL WOMAN WAS DISCOVERED IN OXFORD 
SHE WAS LAST SEEN DRINKING WITH A STUDENT IN A NEARBY TAVERN 
THE SUSPECT COULD NOT BE FOUND 
IN REVENGE THE STUDENT'S THREE ROOMMATES 
WERE ARRESTED BY THE TOWN'S AUTHORITIES AND WERE ALL HANGED 
ENRAGED BY THE INJUSTICE ALMOST THE ENTIRE BODY OF STUDENTS AND TEACHERS UPPED AND LEFT 
IT WAS TO BE FIVE YEARS BEFORE THEY RETURNED 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FOURTEEN FORMAL UNIVERSITY REGULATIONS WERE DRAWN UP 
A CHANCELLOR WAS APPOINTED 
AND A SYLLABUS WAS INTRODUCED WITH EXAMS AT THE END 
THE BRITISH UNIVERSITY AS WE KNOW IT TODAY WAS BORN 
AND AS FOR THE TEACHERS WHO FLED FROM OXFORD 
MANY MADE THEIR WAY TO THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE 
AND ESTABLISHED A RIVAL UNIVERSITY 
THE UNIVERSITY IS ONE OF THE GREAT LEGACIES OF THE MEDIEVAL WORLD 
IN TIME RICH PATRONS EVEN KINGS ENDOWED NEW COLLEGES 
THE TOWN OF CAMBRIDGE WAS TRANSFORMED FROM A CROWDED LITTLE RIVER PORT 
INTO ONE OF THE WONDERS OF THE WORLD 
WHAT WAS TAUGHT DIFFERED FROM THE KIND OF LEARNING 
THAT HAD BEEN ENCLOSED IN THE GREAT MONASTERIES OF EUROPE 
SCIENCE PHILOSOPHY LOGIC MATHEMATICS 
AND WITH IT CAME A NEW KIND OF SCHOLAR 
MEN LIKE PETER ABELARD AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS 
WHO SAW HIMSELF AS A WARRIOR FOR TRUTH 
I PREFERRED THE WEAPONS OF LOGIC TO ALL THE OTHER TEACHINGS OF PHILOSOPHY 
AND ARMED WITH THESE 
I CHOSE THE CONFLICTS OF DISPUTATION INSTEAD OF THE TROPHIES OF WAR 
HIS CRITICAL AND ANALYTICAL APPROACH TYPIFIES THE NEW INTELLECTUAL STYLE 
THAT AROSE IN THE TWELFTH AND THIRTEENTH CENTURIES 
AS HE WROTE BY DOUBTING WE COME TO INQUIRING 
AND BY INQUIRING WE PERCEIVE THE TRUTH 
THIS HUNGER FOR A DIFFERENT KIND OF UNDERSTANDING WAS TO THREATEN THE MONASTIC MONOPOLY OF LEARNING 
UPHEAVAL IN THE WIDER WORLD ACCELERATED THIS INTELLECTUAL SHIFT 
CHRISTIAN EUROPE WAS ON THE OFFENSIVE 
ITS KNIGHTS CONQUERING LANDS ALL AROUND THE MEDITERRANEAN 
IN THE ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH CENTURIES 
THE CHRISTIANS OF SPAIN WERE PUSHING SOUTH SEIZING MUSLIM TERRITORY 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHTY FIVE THEY CONQUERED THE GREAT CITY OF TOLEDO 
THIS FORTIFIED CITY HAD BEEN A GREAT CULTURAL CENTRE OF ISLAMIC ARTS AND SCIENCE 
IT WAS A MAJOR PRIZE FOR THE CHRISTIAN ARMIES 
WITHIN ITS WALLS WERE WONDERFUL LIBRARIES 
THEY CONTAINED ANCIENT GREEK TEXTS TRANSLATED INTO ARABIC 
INCLUDING THE SCIENTIFIC WORKS OF THE GREAT PHILOSOPHER ARISTOTLE 
WHICH HAD BEEN UNKNOWN IN THE WEST UNTIL THAT TIME 
WORD OF THESE DISCOVERIES BEGAN TO SPREAD ACROSS EUROPE 
EVEN REACHING THE EARS OF ORDINARY CLERICS IN BRITAIN 
IN ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY OR SO A NORFOLK PRIEST DANIEL OF MORLEY 
HEARD STORIES ABOUT THE MANUSCRIPTS THAT HAD BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE LIBRARIES OF SPAIN 
FRUSTRATED BY WHAT HE SAW AS THE LIMITED INTELLECTUAL WORLD AROUND HIM 
HE PREPARED TO MAKE THE LONG JOURNEY TO SOUTHERN EUROPE 
DANIEL WAS IMPATIENT WITH THE TRADITIONAL LEARNING 
THAT SEEMED DEVOTED TO MINUTE ANNOTATIONS OF TEXTS OF ROMAN LAW 
WHAT EXCITED HIM WAS THE ADVANCED STUDY OF MATHEMATICS GEOMETRY AND ASTRONOMY 
SCIENTIFIC SUBJECTS WERE CELEBRATED ESPECIALLY IN TOLEDO 
I HASTEN THERE TO LEARN FROM THE WORLD'S WISEST PHILOSOPHERS 
IN TOLEDO HE FOUND WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR 
NEVER BEFORE HAD CHRISTIAN SCHOLARS HAD ACCESS TO SUCH A FLOOD OF NEW INFORMATION 
MEN LIKE DANIEL OF MORLEY HELPED START AN INTELLECTUAL REVOLUTION 
IN DANIEL'S BAGGAGE ON HIS WAY BACK FROM SPAIN WERE SCIENTIFIC WORKS 
BY NON CHRISTIAN AUTHORS LIKE THE GREAT MUSLIM SCIENTIST ABU MA'SHAR 
AND BY PRE CHRISTIAN AUTHORS LIKE ARISTOTLE 
AS DANIEL HIMSELF SAID 
HE WAS RETURNING TO ENGLAND WITH A VALUABLE LOAD OF BOOKS 
THE JOURNEY FROM TOLEDO TO NORFOLK WAS JUST THE LATEST PART 
OF AN EXTRAORDINARY INTELLECTUAL VOYAGE 
IDEAS TRAVELLING OVER CENTURIES AND ACROSS CONTINENTS 
ARISTOTLE'S METAPHYSICS 
ARISTOTLE'S PHYSICS 
ARISTOTLE'S BOOK ON ANIMALS 
THESE TEXTS HAD UNDERGONE AN AMAZING JOURNEY BEFORE THEY BECAME AVAILABLE TO THE SCHOLARS OF MEDIEVAL EUROPE 
WRITTEN ORIGINALLY IN THE FOURTH CENTURY B. C. IN ANCIENT GREECE 
THEY'D SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE GREEK WORLD 
THEN MANY CENTURIES LATER WITH THE RISE OF ISLAM AND THE SPREAD OF THE ARAB EMPIRE 
THEY'D BECOME FAMILIAR TO MUSLIM SCHOLARS WHO HAD TRANSLATED THEM IN TO ARABIC 
THEY THEN SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE ISLAMIC WORLD INCLUDING SPAIN 
AND THERE IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY IN THIS MULTI CULTURAL MULTI LINGUAL SOCIETY 
SCHOLARS CAME FROM ENGLAND FROM PARIS FROM ITALY TO SEEK THEM OUT 
AND TO TRANSLATE THEM INTO LATIN THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE OF EDUCATION IN WESTERN EUROPE 
AND THEN AT LAST THESE TEXTS AFTER ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS 
COULD SPREAD INTO THE INTELLECTUAL CENTRES OF THE WEST 
THEY WERE TO CAUSE A SHOCK WAVE 
UP UNTIL NOW THE FOUNDATIONS OF MEDIEVAL PHILOSOPHY HAD BEEN BUILT 
UPON THE BIBLE AND A THOUSAND YEARS OF CHRISTIAN TEACHING 
GOD HAD CREATED THE WORLD IN SEVEN DAYS AND HAD POWER OVER ALL THINGS IN IT 
THE GREEK PHILOSOPHERS STARTED FROM COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS 
THE IDEAS OF THE CLASSICAL GREEK THINKERS SUCH AS ARISTOTLE 
WRITTEN FOUR CENTURIES BEFORE CHRIST OBVIOUSLY TOOK NO ACCOUNT OF THE IDEA OF THE CHRISTIAN GOD 
THEY DEBATED HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY WITH NO REFERENCE TO CHRISTIANITY 
AND OF COURSE THERE WAS NO BIBLICAL REVELATION NO CREATION IN SEVEN DAYS 
INSTEAD THEY ARGUED THAT THE UNIVERSE HAD ALWAYS EXISTED AND WOULD ALWAYS EXIST 
THE WORKS OF ARISTOTLE ALONG WITH THE OTHER GREEK AND ARABIC THINKERS 
PRESENTED THE CHRISTIAN WEST WITH SOMETHING ENTIRELY NEW 
A RATIONAL SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE UNIVERSE BASED ON PRINCIPLES THAT WERE NON CHRISTIAN 
A PICTURE OF THE WORLD BASED ON NATURE AND REASON ALONE 
THE RESPONSE OF THE CHURCH AUTHORITIES COULD HAVE BEEN PREDICTED 
THE BOOKS OF ARISTOTLE ON NATURAL PHILOSOPHY 
AND THE COMMENTARIES ON THEM SHALL NOT BE READ AT PARIS 
IN PUBLIC OR IN PRIVATE UNDER PAIN OF EXCOMMUNICATION 
MONKS CHANT 
WORSE STILL IF THERE ARE NATURAL LAWS THAT GOVERN THE UNIVERSE 
THAT WOULD SEEM TO IMPLY THAT GOD IS THEIR PRISONER 
TO SOME SUCH THINKING SEEMED NOTHING SHORT OF HERESY 
RELIGIOUS BELIEF SEEMED TO BE ON A COLLISION COURSE 
WITH RATIONAL THEORIES ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE WORLD 
IT WOULD TAKE A REMARKABLE DOMINICAN FRIAR TO RECONCILE THE APPARENTLY IRRECONCILABLE 
THOMAS AQUINAS CAME FROM AN ARISTOCRATIC FAMILY IN SOUTHERN ITALY 
HE WAS A STUDIOUS BOY AND HIS FAMILY SEEM TO HAVE HAD QUITE SPECIFIC AMBITIONS FOR HIM 
THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE RATHER FINE IF HE BECAME ABBOT 
OF THE NEARBY AND FABULOUSLY WEALTHY MONASTERY OF MONTE CASSINO 
BUT THOMAS HAD OTHER IDEAS 
HE WAS ATTRACTED BY THE NEWLY FOUNDED DOMINICAN ORDER 
WHICH PROMISED POVERTY PREACHING AND TEACHING 
HIS FAMILY WERE OUTRAGED AT THIS WAYWARD BEHAVIOUR 
THEY TRIED EVERYTHING THEY COULD DO TO BREAK HIS RESOLVE 
THEY EVEN LOCKED HIM UP AND SENT SEDUCTIVE YOUNG WOMEN TO VISIT HIM 
BUT HE PERSEVERED AND SET OFF AS A DOMINICAN TO PARIS THE HEART OF THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE OF WESTERN EUROPE 
THERE AQUINAS ENCOUNTERED THE IDEAS OF ARISTOTLE 
HE REALISED THAT THE CHURCH HAD EITHER TO ACCOMMODATE ARISTOTLE OR BE OVERWHELMED BY HIM 
HUMAN REASONING AQUINAS ARGUED DERIVES FROM GOD 
CHRISTIAN REVELATION ALSO DERIVES FROM GOD 
IF HUMAN REASON WAS USED CORRECTLY 
IT COULD NOT CONTRADICT WHAT GOD HAD REVEALED IN THE BIBLE 
HAD THE UNIVERSE ALWAYS EXISTED OR DID IT HAVE A BEGINNING 
AQUINAS ARGUED THAT THIS COULD NEITHER BE PROVED NOR DISPROVED BY REASON ALONE 
ARISTOTLE HAD GONE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE WITH REASON 
ONLY DIVINE REVELATION COULD GIVE US THE TRUTH HERE 
IN HIS HUGE WORK THE SUMMA THEOLOGICAL 
AQUINAS LAID OUT EVERY CONCEIVABLE ARGUMENT BETWEEN THE TWO WAYS OF THINKING 
AQUINAS HAD PULLED OFF A HERCULEAN TASK OF SCHOLARSHIP 
SO INTENSE WAS THE EXPERIENCE IT TOOK A HEAVY TOLL ON BOTH MIND AND BODY 
COMPARED TO THE GREAT GLORY OF GOD 
MY WRITING IS LIKE STRAW 
HE DIED LEAVING THE SUMMA UNFINISHED 
BUT HIS IDEAS LIVED ON 
THE USE OF REASON BASED ON ARISTOTLE 
TO STRENGTHEN CHRISTIAN THINKING CAME TO BE KNOWN AS SCHOLASTICISM 
NO QUESTION WAS TOO DIFFICULT OR TOO OBSCURE 
INDEED THE PERIOD WAS TO BECOME SO CELEBRATED OR NOTORIOUS FOR INTENSE THEOLOGICAL INQUIRY 
THAT MEDIEVAL THINKERS ARE OFTEN SAID TO HAVE WRESTLED WITH THE BURNING QUESTION 
HOW MANY ANGELS CAN DANCE ON THE HEAD OF A PIN 
IN FACT THIS ISN'T A GENUINE PIECE OF MEDIEVAL HEAD SCRATCHING 
BUT A VICTORIAN PASTICHE OF IT 
BUT IT'S NOT WITHOUT A GRAIN OF TRUTH 
TOMAS AQUINAS DID SPECULATE WHETHER ANGELS WHO OF COURSE HAVE NO BODIES IN THE USUAL SENSE 
COULD OCCUPY MORE THAN ONE SPACE AT THE SAME TIME OR WHETHER MANY OF THEM COULD BE IN THE SAME SPACE 
IT'S THE MEDIEVAL EQUIVALENT OF THE KIND OF QUESTION ASKED TODAY 
IN QUANTUM PHYSICS CAN SOMETHING BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE 
BUT THE POINT IS THIS IF YOU KNOW THAT ANGELS EXIST BECAUSE RELIGIOUS REVELATION TELLS YOU SO 
IT MAKES SENSE TO USE YOUR INTELLECT AND REASON TO ASK WHAT THEY ARE LIKE 
WHERE THEY CAN GO WHAT THEY CAN DO 
IN THAT SENSE IT'S A PERFECTLY RATIONAL QUESTION 
EARLY MEDIEVAL THINKERS HAD MARVELLED AT ECLIPSES FISH PEOPLE AND MEN FROM THE SKY 
THEIR LATER SUCCESSORS WERE MORE SOPHISTICATED 
THEIR MASTERY OF RATIONAL DEBATE PROVIDED THEM WITH THE TOOLS 
TO UNDERSTAND A FLOOD OF NEW INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE 
THAT POURED INTO WESTERN EUROPE DURING THE TWELFTH AND THIRTEENTH CENTURIES 
CONTACT WITH THE ARAB WORLD BROUGHT MORE THAN AN INTRODUCTION TO ARISTOTLE 
WHAT THE MUSLIMS EXCELLED IN WAS SCIENCE 
AND MEDIEVAL INTELLECTUALS WERE DAZZLED BY THEIR LEARNING 
ARABIC WORDS SUDDENLY APPEARED IN SCIENTIFIC LANGUAGE 
ALGEBRA ALCHEMY THE EARLIEST FORM OF CHEMISTRY 
ALCOHOL AS A LABORATORY SUBSTANCE 
AND THE STAR NAMES LIKE ALDEBARAN AND ALGOL 
AND PERHAPS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPORT OF ALL ARABIC NUMERALS 
IF YOU TRY DOING CALCULATIONS WITH ROMAN NUMERALS 
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY 
KNOWLEDGE HAD ADVANCED PERHAPS A THOUSAND YEARS IN JUST A CENTURY 
THE STAGE WAS SET FOR A MAN WHO HAS BEEN CALLED 
THE FATHER OF MODERN SCIENCE THE FRANCISCAN FRIAR ROGER BACON 
INSPIRED BY MUSLIM PHILOSOPHERS BACON GRASPED THE IMPORTANCE 
OF TESTING ACCEPTED ARGUMENTS WITH CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTS 
THE STRONGEST ARGUMENTS PROVE NOTHING SO LONG AS THE CONCLUSIONS ARE NOT VERIFIED BY EXPERIENCE 
ALL THINGS MUST BE VERIFIED BY THE PATH OF EXPERIENCE ROGER BACON WROTE 
EXPERIMENTS ON A LARGE SCALE WITH INSTRUMENTS ARE REQUIRED 
EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE TEACHES HOW WONDERFUL INSTRUMENTS CAN BE MADE 
BACON WAS ESPECIALLY FASCINATED BY LIGHT 
INDEED HE THOUGHT THAT THE LIGHT EMITTED BY OBJECTS 
WAS THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THE UNIVERSE 
EVERYTHING THAT HAS ACTUAL EXISTENCE IN THE WORLD OF THE ELEMENTS 
SENDS OUT RAYS IN EVERY DIRECTION 
HE QUESTIONED WHY A CANDLE APPEARED TO BE UPSIDE DOWN 
WHEN OBSERVED THROUGH WATER 
HE RECOGNISED THAT A RAINBOW WAS NOT A PHYSICAL OBJECT 
BUT AN EFFECT OF LIGHT ON THE EYE 
THERE ARE AS MANY RAINBOWS AS THERE ARE OBSERVERS 
HE COULD EVEN CREATE A RAINBOW IN HIS LABORATORY 
HE UNDERSTOOD ITS GEOMETRY 
AND CALCULATED THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT IT COULD APPEAR IN THE SKY 
SLOWLY BUT SURELY THE WORLD WAS BEING DISENCHANTED 
FROM A CREATION SUSTAINED BY DIVINE WILL TO ONE WHICH FOLLOWED ITS OWN NATURAL LAWS 
AND HUMAN BEINGS TOO HE THOUGHT ARE GOVERNED BY SUCH LAWS 
THIS WAS MORE THAN THE CHURCH WAS WILLING TO ACCEPT 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN HIS IDEAS WERE CONDEMNED AS SUSPECT NOVELTIES 
AND HE WAS IMPRISONED 
BACON DREAMED OF WHAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE IN THE MODERN WORLD OF SCIENCE 
MACHINES FOR NAVIGATION CAN BE MADE WITHOUT ROWERS 
CARRIAGES CAN BE MADE THAT ARE MOVED WITHOUT ANIMALS 
FLYING MACHINES 
AND MACHINES FOR WALKING IN THE SEA EVEN TO THE BOTTOM 
BACON'S VISION OF A TECHNOLOGICAL FUTURE CLEARLY SIGNALS 
A RADICAL SHIFT THAT WAS TO OCCUR IN OUR ATTITUDE TO THE PHYSICAL WORLD 
FROM AWED CONTEMPLATION TO A SENSE OF MASTERY 
SLOWLY BUT SURELY THE WORLD WAS BEING OBSERVED 
ANALYSED AND MEASURED 
TO MEASURE EVENTS IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD 
CALLED FOR A MORE SOPHISTICATED MEASUREMENT OF TIME ITSELF 
IN THE EARLY MIDDLE AGES 
TIME WAS MEASURED SIMPLY BY IRREGULAR POINTS IN THE DAY 
MEALS CHURCH SERVICES HIGH AND LOW TIDES 
ACCURATE MECHANICAL CLOCKS WERE ESSENTIAL TO STANDARDISE ITS MEASUREMENT 
ISLAMIC TECHNOLOGIES HAD DEMONSTRATED PRECISION ENGINEERING 
BUT AS ROBERT THE ENGLISHMAN DOCUMENTED IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE 
IN ORDER TO MAKE A CLOCK AN APPARENTLY INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEM HAD TO BE RESOLVED 
CLOCKMAKERS ARE TRYING TO MAKE A WHEEL 
WHICH WILL MAKE ONE COMPLETE REVOLUTION IN EACH DAY 
BUT THEY CANNOT QUITE PERFECT THEIR WORK 
WHAT PREVENTED THEM PERFECTING THEIR WORK 
WAS THE ABSENCE OF A DEVICE TO ALLOW THE WHEEL TO TURN IN PRECISELY EQUAL MOVEMENTS 
IN TECHNICAL TERMS AN ESCAPEMENT 
AS THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY DREW TO A CLOSE RICH ABBEYS AND CATHEDRALS 
GAVE HUGE RESOURCES OF MONEY TO THE INVENTING OF AN ACCURATE CLOCK 
THIS IS THE MECHANISM OF THE WELLS CATHEDRAL CLOCK 
NOW IN THE SCIENCE MUSEUM IN LONDON 
IT'S ONE OF THE OLDEST SURVIVING MECHANICAL CLOCKS IN THE WORLD 
ALTHOUGH SOME PARTS OF IT ARE LATER LIKE THE PENDULUM 
ADDED IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THE HEART OF IT IS OVER SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
AND IT'S A MAGNIFICENT WITNESS TO THE SKILL AND INGENUITY 
OF THE MEDIEVAL CLOCKMAKER'S ART 
SOLVING ALL THOSE PROBLEMS OUTLINED BY ROBERT THE ENGLISHMAN 
AT FIRST MECHANICAL CLOCKS MERELY RANG A BELL EVERY HOUR 
BUT THIS CLOCK WHEN IN SITU IN WELLS CATHEDRAL 
WAS GIVEN A FACE AND SOME INGENIOUS ENTERTAINMENT 
NOW HOURS MINUTES SECONDS COULD BE OBSERVED AND STANDARDISED 
SOMETHING AS ABSTRACT AS TIME ITSELF COULD NOW BE SEEN AND MEASURED 
CLOCKS GAVE AN ENTIRE NEW WAY OF THINKING 
THINGS COULD GO LIKE CLOCKWORK 
AND IN THE LONG RUN IT MEANT THAT STATE BUREAUCRACIES COULD RUN MORE EFFICIENTLY 
AND IN SCIENCE THAT RATES OF REACTIONS COULD BE MEASURED 
MEDIEVAL EUROPE WAS BECOMING A POWERFUL CENTRE OF NEW SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
THE GREAT CHURCHES AND CATHEDRALS BECAME MORE AMBITIOUS 
IN THEIR DESIGN AND ENGINEERING 
REACHING HIGHER AND HIGHER TOWARDS HEAVEN 
WARFARE DEMANDED DEADLIER MORE ADVANCED WEAPONRY 
AND IN ITALY THE FIRST SEMBLANCE OF A BANKING SYSTEM WAS BEING SET UP TO FUND VIGOROUS INTERNATIONAL TRADE 
BUT THERE WAS A SURPRISE IN STORE FOR THESE SOPHISTICATED EUROPEANS 
AN UNIMAGINABLY ADVANCED WORLD WAS ABOUT TO BE OPENED UP TO THEM 
OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE 
AND ALSO WHO WE SHARED IT WITH WAS ABOUT TO BE RADICALLY TRANSFORMED 
AND SOME OF THE MOST CHERISHED NOTIONS OF MEDIEVAL KNOWLEDGE WOULD ALSO BE PUT TO THE TEST 
THE CONQUEST OF ONE THIRD OF THE KNOWN WORLD BY GENGHIS KHAN 
AND HIS MONGOL SUCCESSORS IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY 
PROVIDED A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY 
AS THE DUST SETTLED ON THE VAST NEW EMPIRE 
IT PROVIDED A GATEWAY TO ASIA 
IT WAS NOW POSSIBLE TO TRAVEL RELATIVELY SECURELY FROM ONE END OF EURASIA TO THE OTHER 
FROM WESTERN EUROPE TO THE HEART OF CHINA 
THE GREAT AGE OF MEDIEVAL WORLD TRAVEL WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THREE A FRANCISCAN FRIAR WILLIAM OF RUBRUCK WAS AMONGST 
THE FIRST EUROPEANS TO REACH THE MONGOL CAPITAL OF KARAKORUM 
WE CAME AMONG THE MONGOLS 
AND IT TRULY SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD ENTERED ANOTHER WORLD 
HE HOPED TO MEET THE STRANGE CREATURES DESCRIBED IN THE HEREFORD MAPPA MUNDI 
THE MONOPODS AND UNICORNS 
BUT THEY WERE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND 
I ASKED ABOUT THE MONSTERS OR HUMAN MONSTROSITIES 
OF WHICH THE SCHOLARS SPEAK 
THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH WHICH ASTONISHED ME GREATLY IF IT BE TRUE 
ON THE CONTRARY IT APPEARED THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE EAST 
THOUGHT THAT DOG HEADS LIVED IN THE WEST 
WHEREVER THE TRAVELLERS WENT ASKING FOR THEM THEY ENCOUNTERED PEOPLE WHO SAID 
WHAT WE THOUGHT THEY LIVED WHERE YOU CAME FROM 
OTHER EUROPEANS SOON FOLLOWED TO CONTINUE THE QUEST 
JOHN DE MARIGNOLIS WAS SENT BY THE POPE 
I WAS HUNTING FOR THE MONSTROUS RACES DESCRIBED IN THE OLD LITERATURE 
THE ONE EYED PEOPLE 
THE HERMAPHRODITES AND THE DOG HEADS 
IT WAS BECOMING CLEAR THAT THE MONSTERS LIVED JUST OVER THE HORIZON 
AS THE HORIZON WAS PUSHED BACK SO THE MYTHS RECEDED 
A LONG STANDING PUZZLE OF WHETHER OR NOT TO PREACH TO DOG HEADS 
OR MONOPODS WAS SOLVED BY THE ABSENCE OF THOSE CREATURES 
SO WHAT WAS OUT THERE BEYOND EUROPE 
A WORLD MORE EXTRAORDINARY 
THAN ANYTHING THE MEDIEVAL MIND HAD IMAGINED 
IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD SON OF AN ITALIAN MERCHANT 
LEFT HIS NATIVE CITY OF VENICE FOR CHINA 
MARCO POLO WAS NOT TO RETURN FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
HIS EPIC ODYSSEY BROUGHT HIM FAME LASTING EVEN TO THIS DAY 
ON HIS RETURN TO EUROPE HE WROTE A BOOK DESCRIBING HIS JOURNEYS 
THE TRAVELS OF MARCO POLO 
IT CAUSED A SENSATION 
IT CONTAINED REPORTS OF STUNNING CIVILISATIONS 
FAR IN ADVANCE OF OUR OWN 
WILD AND DANGEROUS LANDSCAPES UNLIKE ANYTHING IN EUROPE 
AND TALES OF SURVIVAL THAT BEGGARED BELIEF 
THE DESERT IS SO LONG 
THAT IT WOULD TAKE A YEAR TO GO FROM END TO END 
IT CONSISTS ENTIRELY OF MOUNTAINS AND SAND AND VALLEYS 
THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL TO EAT 
MARCO POLO'S ACCOUNT OF THE PALACES OF THE EAST 
DESCRIBED UNIMAGINABLE WEALTH AND POWER 
THE WALLS OF THE HALLS AND CHAMBERS ARE ALL COVERED IN GOLD AND SILVER 
THE HALL ALONE IS SO VAST AND SO WIDE 
THAT A MEAL MIGHT WELL BE SERVED FOR MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND MEN 
WHEN HE WAS ON HIS DEATHBED MARCO POLO'S FRIENDS CAME TO HIM AND SAID 
NOW IS YOUR LAST CHANCE TO CORRECT ALL THOSE FALSEHOODS YOU PUT IN THE BOOK 
HE LOOKED UP AT THEM AND SAID 
I HAVEN'T TOLD HALF OF WHAT I ACTUALLY SAW 
MERCHANTS AND MISSIONARIES STREAMED INTO CHINA 
THE SILK ROAD TOOK TRAVELLERS FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN 
TO THE EAST CHINA SEA ALLOWING EXCHANGE OF IDEAS GOODS AND TECHNOLOGY 
THEN ALL THIS CAME TO A SUDDEN END 
WITH THE COLLAPSE OF THE MONGOLS IN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT 
THE ROUTE TO THE EAST WAS CLOSED 
BUT THE WEST WAS HUNGRY TO RENEW CONTACT WITH THE EAST 
DRAWN TO THE RICHES AND EXOTIC PLACES IT KNEW EXISTED THERE 
ANOTHER ROUTE HAD TO BE FOUND 
ONE ITALIAN SAILOR BECAME OBSESSED WITH MARCO POLO'S BOOK 
HE CARRIED IT AROUND WITH HIM AND HE MADE LITTLE MARGINAL NOTES ON IT 
HIS NAME WAS CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS 
COLUMBUS HAD STUDIED MAPS LIKE THE HEREFORD MAPPA MUNDI 
HE'D READ THE BIBLE CAREFULLY 
FOR HINTS ABOUT THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE EARTH 
BUT HE HAD A MORE RADICAL IDEA 
HE WAS DETERMINED TO SEEK THE FABULOUS EAST BY SAILING WEST 
COLUMBUS' ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERY OF AMERICA SHRANK THE WORLD 
IT WAS A WATERSHED IN THE HISTORY OF MEDIEVAL EUROPE 
THE MOMENT WHEN NEW HORIZONS OPENED 
AND THE START OF A NEW ERA IN THE MEETING OF CULTURES 
COLUMBUS' VOYAGE OF ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO 
MARKED THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS OF GLOBALISATION 
AND EUROPEAN COLONISATION THAT HAS CREATED THE WORLD WE LIVE IN TODAY 
BUT WHEN COLUMBUS SAILED THE OCEAN HE DID SO WITH A VERY MEDIEVAL MIND 
HE THOUGHT HE HAD REACHED THE FABULOUS EAST DESCRIBED BY MARCO POLO 
LIKE OTHER TRAVELLERS HE BELIEVED HE WOULD MEET STRANGE RACES 
CANNIBALS AMAZONS DOG HEADS 
AND IN SOUTH AMERICA 
HE BELIEVED HE HAD FOUND THE BIBLICAL GARDEN OF EDEN 
I AM FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT THE EARTHLY PARADISE TRULY LIES HERE 
COLUMBUS' VOYAGE TO AMERICA MARKS THE END OF THE MEDIEVAL AGE 
AND THE BIRTH OF THE MODERN ONE 
A NEW PERIOD OF DISCOVERY AND EXPANSION 
AND CONQUEST WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN 
THE DISENCHANTMENT OF THE WORLD WAS NEARLY COMPLETE 
EARLY MEDIEVAL MEN AND WOMEN SAW THE EARTH AS DIVINELY CREATED AND ORDERED 
ITS WORKINGS WERE BEYOND THEIR CONTROL 
FOR THEIR MODERN SUCCESSORS ARMED WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES 
FROM THE COMPASS TO IMPROVED SAILING SHIPS TO GUNPOWDER 
IT WAS A PLACE TO BE MASTERED EXPLOITED 
IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE IT WAS THE DISCOVERY OF A NEW WORLD 
FOR A FREE POSTER FEATURING THE MEDIEVAL LOCATIONS FROM THE SERIES
