WAS BAD ENOUGH HAVING A MISCARRIAGE 
AND THEN FEELING DIRTY AS WELL WE WE WILL FIND OUT HOW THEY ARE NOW 
TRYING TO CLEAN UP THEIR ACT 
ALSO TONIGHT GUILTY THE BROTHERS 
WHO RAN DOWN AND KILLED THIS FATHER 
OF TWO AFTER TRYING TO STEAL HIS 
CAR STEREO 
AND THE SCENE IS SET IN BATTERSEA 
PARK FOR THE ARRIVAL OF PRINCE 
CHARLES WHO WILL BE GIVING AN 
AWARD FOR SUPPORTING ONE OF 
LONDON'S BEST KNOWN CHILDREN'S 
CHARITIES CHARITIES PLUS THE WOMAN WITH THE MULTI 
MILLION POUND BODY BUT THIS 
ARTIST'S MUSE WILL NOT SEE A PENNY 
GOOD EVENING LONDON HAS THE BEST 
AND THE WORST HOSPITALS IN THE 
COUNTRY ACCORDING TO THE PEOPLE 
WHO KNOW THE PATIENCE THE 
FINDINGS COME IN A REPORT TODAY 
FROM THE HEALTHCARE COMMISSION IT 
MAKES GOOD READING FOR SOME 
INCLUDING THE ROYAL MARSDEN AND 
ROYAL BROMPTON IN CHELSEA BUT IT 
IS DEVASTATING FOR SEVERAL MORE 
WHEN ASKED TO RATE THE CARE THEY 
RECEIVED PATIENTS PUT THESE SIX 
HEALTH TRUSTS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 
NATIONAL TABLE KARL MERCER REPORTS 
FROM THE WORST OFFENDER EALING 
IT MAY BE A POPULAR DESTINATION FOR 
LOCAL BUSES BUT THE SAME CANNOT BE 
SAID FOR LOCAL PATIENTS EALING HAS 
BEEN LABELLED THE WORST HOSPITAL IN 
THE CAPITAL AND ONE OF THE WORST IN 
THE COUNTRY THE JUDGMENT CAME FROM 
PATIENTS THEMSELVES 
THE HOSPITAL 
ITSELF WAS I WAS UNHAPPY ABOUT 
STAYING OVERNIGHT L. FELT UNCLEAN 
IT WAS BAD ENOUGH HAVING A 
MISCARRIAGE AND THEN GOING HOME 
AND FEELING DIRTY AS WELL THIS THIS BOARD SHOWS THE RESULTS OF 
DEALING'S WEEKLY SURVEY OF ITS OWN 
PATIENTS BUT MUCH OF IT DOES NOT 
TALLY WITH THE FINDINGS OF TODAY'S 
REPORT CARE AT THE INN WAS RATED 
AS THE WORST IN THE COUNTRY IT 
ALSO CAME CLOSE TO THE BOTTOM FOR 
CLEANLINESS AND FOR TREATING 
PATIENTS WITH RESPECT THEY ARE NOT 
PAYING ATTENTION TO THE BASICS 
FROM PATIENTS' POINT OF VIEW THESE THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT ANY 
ORGANISATION PROVIDING CARE SHOULD 
BE DOING AS A MATTER OF COURSE 
EALING IS HOPING PADDY BYRNE WILL 
BE THE FACE OF THINGS TO COME HE 
IS RECOVERING FROM STROKE HE HAD 
LAST WEEK AND IS MORE THAN HAPPY 
WITH THE CARE HE HAS RECEIVED VERY VERY GOOD YEAH 
NURSES GOOD 
YEAH YEAH 
AND I HAVE NOT SEEN A BAD ONE YET 
STAFF FEEL A BIT DISHEARTENED WHEN 
WE HEAR THINGS LIKE THAT BUT WE 
ARE PROUD OF OUR WORK AND WE KNOW 
HOW WE CARE FOR PATIENTS 
UP FOR 
EALING'S MANAGEMENT IT IS A LONG 
WAY BACK BEING BOTTOM OF THE 
LEAGUE TABLES CAN HIT STAFF MORALE 
THE CHALLENGE IS TO SEE RESULT ON 
A PIECE OF PAPER IT WILL BE HARD 
TO CONVINCE STAFF ALL I CAN SAY IS 
THAT WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO WORK 
WITH US TO USE OUR SERVICES AND 
HELP US MAKE THEM BETTER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE CAME HERE LAST YEAR THOSE 
WHO CAN NOW MAY COME ARMED WITH 
QUESTIONS AS WELL AS ILLNESSES 
WHY ARE THERE SUCH DIFFERENCES 
AMONGST THE CAPITAL'S HOSPITALS IT IT IS NO SURPRISE HER IF YOU LOOK AT 
WHERE THOSE HOSPITALS ARE THEY ARE 
IN THE POOREST AREAS OF LONDON 
HACKNEYS BARKINGS EALING IS ON 
THE EDGE OF SOUTH POLE THEY ARE 
DEALING WITH VARIED COMMUNITIES AND 
VARIED DISEASES SOUTHALL IT CAN 
BE HARD TO ATTRACT THE BEST QUALITY 
STAFF THEY FIND IT HARD TO RECRUIT 
PEOPLE WHO WILL RETAIN STANDARDS 
RETAINING STAFF IS ALSO ONE OF THE 
DIFFICULTIES PEOPLE FEEL THEY ARE 
WORKING IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE 
THEY ARE NOT VALUED AT THE OTHER 
END OF THE SCALE WE HAVE THE ROYAL 
BROMPTON PLACES WITH A WELL 
RENOWNED REPUTATIONS AND SPECIALIST 
CENTRES WHICH ATTRACT GOOD STAFF 
AND CAN KEEP HOLD OF THEM THAT IS 
ONE OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES THE 
THING TO PICK OUT FROM THIS SURVEY 
BY THE HEALTHCARE COMMISSION IS 
THAT THIS IS THE PATIENTS' VOICE 
BEING HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE QUESTIONED 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THEIR VOICE 
IS BEING HEARD AS WELL AS THE 
GOVERNMENT TARGETS 
WE HAVE PLENTY MORE FOR YOU TONIGHT 
INCLUDING HER HAVING CONSIDERED 
THE SITUATION I WAS IN WITH THE 
SOUNDS OF HUMAN SUFFERING I DO NOT 
BELIEVE I HAD A CHOICE 
IT WAS A 
JOB I HAD TO DO 
A YEAR ROW OF SEVENTH 
JULY BOMBINGS IS RECOGNISED FOR HIS 
BRAVERY A HERO 
TWO BROTHERS HAVE BEEN FOUND GUILTY 
OF RUNNING DOWN AND KILLING A 
FATHER OF TWO BALBIR MATHARU WAS

YOU DO NOT WANT TO 
SEE ANYONE YOU KNOW LIKE THAT

DIFFICULT AND IT IS DIFFICULT NOW 
THE AFTERNOON A JURY FOUND TWO 
BROTHERS GUILTY THEY WERE ADDICTED 
TO DRUGS FUNDING OF THEIR HABIT BY 
STEALING SO DESPERATE NOT TO GET 
CAUGHT FOR TRIVIAL OFFENCE THEY 
COMMITTED A FAR MORE SERIOUS ONE 
BUT THEY WERE ONLY COURT BECAUSE 
ONE OF THE BROTHERS BOASTED OF 
KILLING BALBIR MATHARU WHILE IN 
JAIL FOR ANOTHER CRIME 
THEY HAVE 
GOT THEIR DESERTS TODAY THEY ARE 
TOTAL LOW LIFE TOMMY WILL IT 
HIMSELF DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS A 
SCUMBAG THAT IS THE MOST HONEST 
THING HE SAID DURING THE WHOLE OF 
THE INQUIRY 
THE MURDER CAUSED 
CONTROVERSY AT THE TIME MET 
COMMISSIONER SIR IAN BLAIR ACCUSED 
MAINSTREAM MEDIA OF INSTITUTIONAL 
RACISM BUT THE DEATH OF AN ASIAN

ROBBERY IN KENSAL GREEN MR. 
MATHARU'S MURDER WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY

IT IS POSITIVE WHAT WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT BUT THE HEADLINES DO NOT 
GIVE A POSITIVE IMPRESSION OF WHAT 
IS HAPPENING TO YOUNG PEOPLE IS 
THIS AS BAD A TIME AS YOU CAN 
REMEMBER THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN 
LONDON 
IT IS A TERRIBLE TIME FOR LONDON YOUNG PEOPLE IN LONDON BUT WHAT 
PRINCE CHARLES HAS DONE FOR YOUNG 
PEOPLE IS AN EXAMPLE WE SHOULD ALL 
FOLLOW THREE YEARS HE HAS 
SUPPORTED YOUNG PEOPLE AND FOUND 
THEIR TALENTS AND NURTURED IT 
THROUGH THE PRINCE'S TRUST GETTING 
BUSINESSES INVOLVED IN THE 
COMMUNITY TONIGHT IS ABOUT OUR 
YOUNG PEOPLE SAYING THANK YOU TO 
PRINCE CHARLES FOR HAVING BEEN 
THERE BEFORE ANYONE ELSE 
HE HAS 
SUPPORTED YOUR CHARITY SINCE TWO THOUSAND 
BUT WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT A TOUGHER 
APPROACH FROM THE MET IN THE LAST 
TWENTY FOUR HOURS ZERO TOLERANCE AND SO ON 
IS THAT THE KIND OF THING YOU WANT 
TO HEAR AND IS IT HELPFUL A A COURSE THERE SHOULD BE ZERO 
TOLERANCE TO CRIME BUT BEFORE WE 
CAN ACHIEVE THAT WE MUST 
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MUST BE ZERO 
TOLERANCE FOR VIOLENCE AND THAT IS 
VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN CHILDREN 
BECOME VIOLENT BECAUSE OF WHAT 
ADULTS DO TO THEM THAT IS THE 
MISSING TRUTH IN OUR PUBLIC 
NARRATIVE LET'S STOP CHILD ABUSE 
AND VIOLENCE WILL STOP 
THIS IS AN 
EVENING OF CELEBRATION AND FUND 
RAISING FOUR MILLION IS NEEDED TO 
KEEP A CHARITY DURING THROUGHOUT 
THE YEAR 
POLICE ARE WARNING LANDLORDS TO BE 
AWARE OF GANGS TURNING RENTED 
HOUSES INTO CANNABIS FACTORIES 
HOUNSLOW POLICE CLOSED DOWN THIRTY SIX IN 
THE BOROUGH IN THE LAST YEAR THE 
COUNCIL IS CONTINUING TO RECEIVE 
COMPLAINTS FROM LANDLORDS WHOSE 
PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO 
DUCK MAKING DENS 
YOU WOULD NOT THINK IT BUT BEHIND 
ONE OF THESE DOORS IN HOUNSLOW IS A 
CANNABIS FACTORY FIFTEEN THOUSAND WORTH OF 
THE DRUG WAS FOUND AT THIS HOUSE 
WITH EVIDENCE OF MORE HAVING BEEN 
MADE THIRTY SIX SUCH FACTORIES HAVE BEEN 
SHUT DOWN BY THE POLICE IN THE LAST 
TWELVE MONTHS AND THEY SUSPECT THERE 
ARE MORE 
A COMMON THEME 
PARTICULARLY IN HOUNSLOW IS A 
VIETNAMESE LINK THERE IS 
VIETNAMESE CONTROL OVER WHAT IS 
HAPPENING IN THESE FACTORIES THEY 
ARE SECURING THE PROPERTIES AND 
INSTALLING THE EQUIPMENT NECESSARY 
TO GROW THE PLANTS THAT IS A 
COMMON FEATURE L. DO NOT KNOW WHY 
THAT IS 
WHEN THIS MAN RENTED HIS 
FAMILY PROPERTY EARLIER THIS YEAR 
HE DID NOT EXPECT TO BE REBUILDING 
HIS HOUSE A FEW MONTHS LATER 
DESPITE THOROUGH CHECKS HIS 
TENANTS WERE NOT WHAT THEY SEEMED 
THEY STRIPPED HIS PROPERTY AND 
TURNED IT INTO A DRUG DEN 
YOU FEEL 
VIOLATED YOU TRUST PEOPLE WITH 
YOUR PROPERTY GIVE THEM A ROOF 
OVER YOUR HEAD THERE HAD A YOUNG 
COUPLE STARTING OUT WANTING TO GET 
AHEAD IN LIFE IT HAS MADE ME THINK 
ABOUT TRUSTING PEOPLE AGAIN WITH WITH NO SUPPORT FROM HIS INSURANCE AND 
LIMITED HELP FROM THE COUNCIL THE 
OWNER IS FORTY THOUSAND OUT OF POCKET 
WHAT ADVICE WOULD HE GIVE OTHER 
LANDLORDS 
IF A COUPLE THAT ARE TO LANDLORDS GOOD TO BE TRUE THEY MIGHT BE 
HALF A DOZEN LANDLORDS HAVE 
CONTACTED THE COUNCIL FOR HELP IF 
ELIGIBLE THEY COULD BENEFIT FROM 
THREE THOUSAND WORTH OF GRANTS 
WE ARE KEEN 
TO ENGAGE AND HELP WHERE WE CAN 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE LANDLORDS 
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS A 
BUSINESS AND THEY MUST BE AWARE OF 
THE RISKS 
BUT FOR THE SRNA THE 
KIROV CONTINUES THE MESSAGE IS 
LANDLORDS BEWARE FOR THIS OWNER 
COMING UP WHY BUSINESS IS BLOOMING 
FOR THE FLOWER GROWERS OF THE HOME 
COUNTIES COUNTIES THERE ARE SUPER MODELS THAT COULD 
NOT GET OUT OF BED FOR LESS THAN 
TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY BUT THIS BOORMAN'S 
BODY IS WORTH SEVENTEEN MILLION WE WILL 
TELL YOU WHY LATER THIS A WOMAN'S 
HE LOST HIS JOB AFTER SUFFERING 
POST TRAUMATIC STRESS BUT TODAY 
TIM COULSON WAS HONOURED FOR 
BRAVERY AFTER RISKING HIS OWN WIFE 
TO HELP OTHER PASSENGERS TRAPPED ON 
A TRAIN AFTER THE JULY THE SEVENTH 
BOMBINGS TIM WAS TRAVELLING 
TOWARDS EDGEWARE ROAD ON THE CIRCLE 
LINE WHEN A BOMB WAS DETONATED ON A 
TUBE COMING THE OTHER WAY 
A BOMB ON THE UNDERGROUND AT 
LIVERPOOL STREET SECONDS LATER 
THE SAME THING HAPPENED NEAR 
EDGWARE ROAD MOST PASSENGERS WHO 
SURVIVED AND COULD WALK LEFT THE 
SCENE SOME STAY TO HELP THE 
INJURED AND DYING TODAY ONE OF 
THEM TIM COULSON RECEIVED A 
BRAVERY AWARD 
THERE WERE 
DISMEMBERED BODIES BODY PARTS THAT 
WERE NO LONGER ATTACHED IT WAS 
FORMING A ROUTINE FOR ME TO SAY 
YOU CAN'T HELP THEM LET'S MOVE ON 
TO THOSE WHO ARE ALIVE AND MAKING 
NOISE THE MAJOR POINT FOR ME WAS A 
MAN HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF WHAT 
REMAINED OF THE FLOOR OF THE 
CARRIAGE IN DESPERATE NEED HE HAD 
NO SHIRT ON IT HAD BEEN BLOWN OFF 
BY THE BAR MACRO AND A VERY WEAK 
PULSE ONE OF THE FIRST AID RULES 
IS THAT IF YOU CAN'T FIND THEIR ARM 
USE THEIR NECK L. COULD NOT FIND 
HIS ARM THAT MAN DIED BUT TIM 
COULSON HELPED OUT WITH ANOTHER 
SURVIVOR 
THE EXPERIENCE LEFT HIM SURVIVOR WITH POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER 
AND HE HAS HAD TO RETIRE EARLY FROM 
HIS JOB 
IT IS RARE MANY MORE 
PEOPLE WERE STUNNED DIDN'T KNOW 
WHAT TO DO DIDN'T THINK OF HELPING 
BUT TIM WENT FORWARD ALONG WITH 
VERY FEW OTHERS AT EACH SITE TO 
HELP THEIR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS 
WOULD YOU ADVISE SOMEONE TO DO THE 
SAME THING THAT YOU DID IN VIEW OF 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU 
I'M NOT 
SURE I WOULD BE THE RIGHT PERSON TO 
ADVISE ANYONE BUT I WOULD 
ENCOURAGE THAT IF YOU FEEL YOU HAVE 
IT WITHIN YOUR PERSONAL MAKE UP TO 
HELP YOU HAVE TO HELP 
IT IS 
UNDERSTOOD SCOTLAND YARD IS 
RECOMMENDING THAT AT LEAST TWENTY 
PEOPLE WHO TRIED TO SAVE LIFE AFTER 
THE BOMBINGS SHOULD RECEIVE 
GALLANTRY AWARDS WHICH ARE THE 
GIFT OF THE QUEEN THE DECISION ON 
THAT IS EXPECTED IN A FEW MONTHS 
A TO FOOTBALL AND WHAT FOR'S HOPES 
OF PROMOTION TO THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
ARE HANGING BY A THREAD GOING INTO 
TONIGHT'S PAIR SEMI FINAL SECOND 
LEG AWAY TO HULL WATFORD THEY 
ARE TRAILING TWO TO ZERO FROM THE FIRST LEG 
DAMIEN JOHNSON WAS AT THE K. C. 
STADIUM EARLIER AND I ASKED HIM HOW 
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS BUILDING 
BUILDING VERY NICELY SOME HULL 
FANS ARE IN CONFIDENT MOOD THINK 
THEY HAVE ONE FOOT IN THE PLAY OFF 
FINAL ALREADY FOOTBALL IS FICKLE 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IT 
IS FICKLE AND THE SENSE THAT 
CRYSTAL PALACE FOUND OUT LAST NIGHT 
BEATEN IN THE OTHER SEMI FINAL 
BEN WATSON MISSED THE PENALTY WHICH 
COULD HAVE SEEN THEM THROUGH 
AGAINST BRISTOL CITY AND WITH 
PROMOTION WORTH SIXTY TWO MILLION IT IS 
NO WONDER HE WAS NERVY BRISTOL WON 
FOUR TO TWO ON AGGREGATE AND AWAIT THE 
WINNERS OF TONIGHT'S IN THE FINAL 
THE WATFORD FANS ARE IN GOOD VOICE 
WE HAVE MET UP WITH SOME OF THEM 
PREPARING TO MAKE THE FIVE HOUR 
COACH TRIP NORTH AND THEY WERE IN 
GOOD VOICE 
HULL THINK THEY ARE 
PRETTY MUCH THERE ALREADY TALKING 
ABOUT THE TICKET PRICES AT WEMBLEY 
PERHAPS THEY WILL BE SURPRISED WE WE HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE THAN HULL AND 
BRISTOL CITY WE CAN DO IT WE 
COULD HAVE DONE A COUPLE OF YEARS 
AGO 
THREE TO ZERO FIRST LEG REALLY BAD NOT AGO A GOOD RESULT BUT A WAVEFORMS 
SUPERB 
WE HAVE BEEN GOOD AWAY FROM SUPERB HOME NOT AT HULL BUT NONE OF THAT 
MATTERS NOW JUST TONIGHT MATTERS 
WATFORD MAY BE GOING INTO THIS TWO TO ZERO 
DOWN BUT THEY DO KNOW A LITTLE BIT 
ABOUT PROMOTION DON'T THEY 
CERTAINLY THEY HAVE WON PROMOTION 
VIA THE PLAY OFFS TWICE IN RECENT 
YEARS BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND ALSO TWO 
YEARS AGO UNDER THE CURRENT 
MANAGER ADEY BOOTHROYD THEY HAVE 
PREVIOUS FORM OF BEING SUCCESSFUL 
THE CRUCIAL THING TONIGHT IS THE 
FIRST GOAL IF IT IS HULL CITY THE 
GAME COULD BE OVER 
MEANWHILE WATFORD'S CHAMPIONSHIP 
RIVALS QPR HAVE APPOINTED IAIN 
DOWIE AS THEIR NEW MANAGER THE 
FORMER CRYSTAL PALACE AND CHARLTON
