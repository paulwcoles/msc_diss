HELLO AND WELCOME TO POSTCARDS FROM KENYA 
TODAY WE'LL LOOK AT WHAT DAILY LIFE IS LIKE 
IN THE COUNTRYSIDE OF KENYA 
LET'S MEET EVANGELINE WHO LIVES ON A FARM OR SHAMBA 
AND FIND OUT WHAT LIFE IS LIKE FOR HER AND HER FAMILY 
HELLO MY NAME IS EVANGELINE 
I'M EIGHT YEARS OLD AND I LIVE IN NARO MORU 
WHERE EVANGELINE LIVES IS VERY CLOSE TO MOUNT KENYA 
WHEN SHE LOOKS AROUND HER VILLAGE SHE SEES THIS KIND OF LANDSCAPE 
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT 
THAT'S MOUNT KENYA OVER THERE IT'S THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN IN KENYA 
THERE ARE SOME MORE MOUNTAINS OFF TO THE WEST 
THESE ARE THE ABERDARE MOUNTAINS THEY'RE NOT AS HIGH AS MOUNT KENYA 
BUT THEY ARE STILL MUCH HIGHER THAN ANYTHING IN BRITAIN 
THERE ARE FEW HOUSES 
EVANGELINE'S NEIGHBOURS ARE SPREAD FAR APART 
FIELDS SURROUND THE HOUSES 
MANY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES ARE FOUND ON THE LAND 
WE GROW CABBAGES AND TOMATOES 
POTATOES AND ONIONS AND MAIZE AND BEANS 
THIS IS THE BIG MAIZE FIELD 
MY MOTHER'S A VERY GOOD FARMER 
MAIZE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CROPS IN KENYA 
IT'S EATEN BY MANY KENYANS 
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAMBA IS A SMALL STREAM 
WHICH COMES OFF THE MOUNTAIN 
EVANGELINE'S HOUSE AND FARM IS SIMILAR 
TO WHAT MANY KENYANS LIVE ON IN THE COUNTRY OR UPCOUNTRY AS WE CALL IT 
AS YOU WATCH THIS SECTION 
THINK HOW THIS IS SIMILAR OR DIFFERENT TO THE START OF YOUR DAY 
I WAKE UP JUST AFTER SIX IN THE MORNING 
I GET WASHED AND DRESSED 
MUM IS BUSY MAKING BREAKFAST 
SHE MAKES TEA AND FRIED EGGS 
THEN I HAVE TO FEED THE CALF 
SHE HASN'T GOT A MOTHER SO I FEED HER 
SHE'S SO GREEDY SOMETIMES I HAVE TO TAKE THE BOWL AWAY FROM HER 
AFTER THAT I CAN HAVE MY BREAKFAST 
ALL MY SISTERS ARE AWAY AT BOARDING SCHOOL 
SO IT'S JUST ME MUM AND DAD 
AT SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY I BEGIN MY JOURNEY TO SCHOOL 
MY SCHOOL IS VERY CLOSE TO MY HOUSE SO I WALK 
ON THE WAY I PASS MAINLY FIELDS 
I ALSO PASS OUR LOCAL SHOP AND HOTEL 
SOMETIMES I MEET MY FRIENDS AND WE WALK TOGETHER 
SIT DOWN THANK YOU TEACHER 
TODAY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LESSON 
ON THE PHYSICAL FEATURES 
WHICH WE FIND IN OUR PROVINCE 
NOW PHYSICAL FEATURES 
ARE ALL THOSE THINGS WHICH YOU FIND ON THE GROUND 
WHICH WERE NOT MADE BY MAN 
WHICH WERE NOT MADE BY 
THESE ARE THINGS SUCH AS WHAT THINGS SUCH AS WHAT 
YES EVA MOUNTAINS YES VERY GOOD 
EVANGELINE HAS LUNCH AT SCHOOL DO YOU 
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER SCHOOL 
I FETCH WATER AND HELP OUT WITH THE THRESHING 
THEY THRESH THE WHEAT TO SEPARATE THE GRAIN FROM THE STEM 
THE GRAIN CAN BE GROUND INTO FLOUR 
CHAFF GETS EVERYWHERE 
AFTER THE HARD WORK IS DONE THEY RELAX IN THE EVENING BY CREATING 
THEIR OWN ENTERTAINMENT 
THAT IS EVANGELINE'S TYPICAL DAY 
BUT NOT EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE LIVES LIKE EVANGELINE'S FAMILY 
SOME PEOPLE LIVE IN HOUSES THAT ARE VERY DIFFERENT 
FROM EVANGELINE'S AND YOUR OWN 
THEY LIVE IN HOUSES MADE ENTIRELY FROM MATERIALS 
FOUND IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
THESE MUD HOUSES ARE COOL IN THE SUMMER AND WARM IN THE WINTER 
TIMBER FROM TREES IS USED TO MAKE THE FRAME AND TO SUPPORT THE ROOF 
THEN IT'S PLASTERED WITH MUD DUNG AND ASHES 
IN HOUSES LIKE THIS YOU CAN SLEEP EAT COOK 
JUST AS YOU WOULD IN ANY OTHER HOUSE 
THIS IS MRS. JUANJURO AND SHE HAS LIVED IN THIS HOUSE FOR THIRTY YEARS 
I BUILT THIS HOUSE WITH HELP FROM MY FRIENDS IN THE VILLAGE 
YOU CAN SEE THE TIMBERS WHICH SUPPORT THE ROOF 
ONCE THE WOODEN FRAMEWORK IS BUILT 
THE MUD IS APPLIED AND DRIES HARD 
A MUD HOUSE WOULDN'T BE PRACTICAL IN BRITAIN BECAUSE OF THE CLIMATE 
HERE IN KENYA IT CAN MAKE A VERY STRONG AND LONG LASTING HOUSE 
SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE HOMES 
IN WHICH THEY LIVE ALL THE TIME 
THEY MOVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE THEY ARE CALLED 
ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS GROUP OF NOMADS IS A TRIBE CALLED THE MASAI 
THE MASAI WERE KNOWN AS WARRIORS 
WHO LIVED BY HUNTING WILD ANIMALS 
THEY DECORATED THEMSELVES IN COLOURFUL BEADS AND CARRIED SPEARS 
THEIR CATTLE ARE MOST IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE THEM WITH EVERYTHING THEY NEED TO SURVIVE 
IN THE DRY SEASON THE MASAI MOVE THE CATTLE FROM PASTURE TO PASTURE 
IN SEARCH OF LANDS UPON WHICH THEY CAN GRAZE 
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS PEOPLE LIVE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE IN KENYA 
I HOPE YOU HAVE ENJOYED YOUR VISIT GOODBYE
