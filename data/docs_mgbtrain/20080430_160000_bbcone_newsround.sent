LIVERPOOL HAVE WON THE COMPETITION 
FIVE TIMES BUT ALWAYS WANT MORE 
PLUS THEY HAVE KNOCKED CHELSEA OUT 
OF THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE TWICE IN 
THE LAST FEW YEARS FOOTBALL 
MATCHES DON'T GET MUCH BIGGER THAN 
THIS THIS THE ONLY MATCH BIGGER THAN THIS ONE 
WILL BE THAT ALL ENGLISH FINAL 
IT'S ALREADY BEING CALLED THE 
BIGGEST MATCH IN THE HISTORY OF 
BRITISH CLUB FOOTBALL WHO'LL JOIN 
MAN UNITED FIND OUT ON NEWSROUND 
BULLETINS TOMORROW MORNING 
THE ROYAL NAVY HAVE DETONATED 
BOMB OUT AT SEA THE WORLD WAR TWO 
EXPLOSIVE BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN 
DROPPED BY THE GERMAN AIR FORCE IN 
NINETEEN FORTY TWO WASHED UP ON A BEACH ON THE 
ENGLISH EAST COAST LAST WEEK AFTER 
TRYING TO TOW IT OUT TO SEA THEY 
LOST IT BUT FINALLY TRACKED IT 
DOWN AGAIN AND BLEW IT UP 
YESTERDAY WE TOLD YOU SCIENTISTS 
WERE THAWING A GIANT SQUID TODAY 
THEY'VE STARTED TO INSPECT IT IT'S 
THE BIGGEST SQUID EVER CAUGHT AND 
WAS FROZEN TO PRESERVE IT AFTER IT 
WAS LANDED BY FISHERMAN LAST YEAR 
THEY'VE ALREADY WORKED THAT IT'S TEN 
METRES LONG WITH EYES THE SIZE OF 
FOOTBALLS NOW THEY WANT TO KNOW 
WHAT IT'S BEEN EATING TO GET SO BIG 
AND HOW'S ABOUT THIS FOR A NIFTY 
WAY OF MOVING HOUSE THE PEOPLE WHO 
OWNED THIS WOODEN PAD IN 
ABERDEENSHIRE IN SCOTLAND LOVED IT 
SO MUCH THEY WANTED TO KEEP SO 
WHEN IT CAME TO MOVING LOCATION 
THEY JUST PICKED IT UP AND DROPPED 
DOWN SOMEWHERE ELSE 
NOW ALL THIS WEEK WE'RE TAKING A 
LOOK AT THINGS THAT WORRY YOU 
TODAY IT'S BODY IMAGE 
WE SEEM TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE 
THE WAY WE LOOK IS REALLY IMPORTANT 
SOME OF US TRY CLOTHES OR MAKE UP 
TO MAKE OURSELVES LOOK NICER WHILE 
OTHER GOES FURTHER SOME GO WAY TOO 
FAR OH DEAR AND KIDS SEEM TO BE 
GETTING MORE WORRIED ABOUT LOOKS 
RECENT RESEARCH RECKONS THREE 
QUARTERS OF EIGHT TO TWELVE YEAR OLD 
GIRLS WANT TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY 
LOOK HALF OF YOU WANT TO LOOK MORE 
LIKE THE WOMEN YOU SEE ON T. V. AND 
MANY MAGAZINES SIX OUT OF TEN OF 
YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE HAPPIER IF 
YOU WERE THINNER BOYS ALSO SEEM TO 
BE MORE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR 
APPEARANCE THIS IS PURE BEAUTY IN 
SHEFFIELD AND IT DOES PARTIES JUST 
FOR KIDS 
WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT 
DRESSING UP 
IT'S JUST REALLY FUN 
AND I JUST LIKE IT 
DO YOU WORRY 
THERE IS TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE PLACED 
ON APPEARANCE FOR KIDS THESE DAYS 
I THINK THERE IS WITH ANYBODY 
REALLY THE MEDIA AND THE 
MAGAZINES THEY'RE ALWAYS TALKING 
ABOUT WHO IS FAT OR THIN WHO HAS 
THE MOST MAKE UP ON SO THEY'RE 
BOUND TO FEEL UNDER PRESSURE SOME SOME OF MY FRIENDS SOMETIMES WORRY ABOUT 
IT BUT I DON'T 
WHAT ABOUT THE 
PEOPLE WHO SAY IT'S WHAT'S ON 
INSIDE THE THAT COUNTS NOT HOW YOU 
LOOK 
YEAH SOMETIMES I THINK LOOK THAT BUT SOMETIMES I DON'T 
DO YOU 
THINK THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE TOO 
WORRIED ABOUT THE WAY THEY LOOK 
THEY SHOULD JUST FORGET ABOUT HOW 
THEY LOOK AND JUST GET ON WITH THE 
REST OF THEIR LIVES 
EVERYONE SEEMS 
TO WEAR MAKE UP FOR T. V. AND PEOPLE 
LOOK GLAMOROUS IN MOVIES AND POP 
VIDEOS WHEN CELEBRITIES MAKE A BIG 
EFFORT WITH THEIR IMAGE IT CAN 
LEAVE THE REST OF US FEELING LESS 
GOOD ABOUT THE WAY WE LOOK AND 
WITH MODELS BEING HELD UP AS THE 
MOST BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE AROUND WE'RE 
ALWAYS REMINDED THEY'RE THINNER 
TALLER AND BETTER LOOKING THAN THE 
REST OF US 
DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR TO BLAME 
CELEBRITIES AND MODELS FOR THIS 
KIND OF OBSESSION WITH APPEARANCE 
I'M NOT SURE IF WE CAN USE THE WORD 
BLAME BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF 
THESE MODELS AND CELEBRITIES ARE 
CAUGHT UP IN IT THEMSELVES A LOT 
OF THEM WILL TELL YOU THEY HAVE 
STRUGGLED WITH ISSUES AROUND WEIGHT 
AND THEIR LOOKS AND IT'S IMPORTANT 
FOR US TO REMEMBER THAT PERHAPS THE 
WOMAN OR THE MAN THAT IS ON THE 
COVER OF THE MAGAZINE WHO IS 
LOOKING SO WONDERFUL MIGHT FEEL AS 
BAD ABOUT THEIR BODY AND FACE AS WE 
DO 
HOW CAN YOU BE COMFORTABLE IN DO YOUR OWN SKIN IS 
THE LESS GOOD YOU 
FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF IN THE INSIDE 
THE MORE YOU'RE GOING TO WORRY 
ABOUT YOUR APPEARANCE SO FIND THE 
THINGS YOU ENJOY THE THINGS THAT 
MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF 
IT CAN BE ANYTHING FROM MARTIAL 
ARTS TO SPORT TO WRITING ART 
WHATEVER IT IS WHEN YOU DEVELOP 
THAT STUFF AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHAT 
YOU'RE DOING THE IMAGE MATTERS 
LESS 
YOU PROBABLY HAVEN'T SEEN A LESS BUTTERFLY IN YOUR LOCAL PARK 
RECENTLY NOW THEY'RE BECOMING SO 
HARD TO SPOT POLITICIANS ARE 
GETTING INVOLVED 
THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT THEY'RE 
USUALLY FULL OF POLITICIANS ARGUING 
ABOUT HOW BEST TO RUN THE COUNTRY 
BUT NOT TODAY MEMBERS OF DIFFERENT 
PARTIES HAVE ACTUALLY AGREED ON 
SOMETHING THEY'RE GOING TO START A 
CAMPAIGN TO SAVE THE BUTTERFLY 
THEY DON'T LIKE THE RAIN SO IT'S 
NOT SURPRISING I CAN'T SEE ANY HERE 
TODAY EVEN WHEN THE SUN SHINES 
EXPERTS SAY THE NUMBERS IN THE U. K. 
ARE THE LOWEST THEY HAVE BEEN FOR 
TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE SMALL TORTOISESHELL 
IN PARTICULAR IS IN REAL TROUBLE 
CLIMATE CHANGE THE WAY WE FARM AND 
POLLUTION IN THE ATMOSPHERE ARE 
THOUGHT TO BE TO BLAME DRAGONFLIES 
ARE ALSO IN DANGER SOME SPECIES 
ARE AT RISK OF BECOMING EXTINCT 
THE GOVERNMENT'S BEING ASKED TO 
COME UP WITH SOME CASH SO THE 
PLACES WHERE BUTTERFLIES AND 
DRAGONFLIES LIVE CAN BE PROTECTED 
SCIENTISTS SAY IF THAT DOESN'T 
HAPPEN WE MAY NEVER SEE A 
BUTTERFLY IN THE WILD AGAIN 
THAT'S IT FOR NOW SEE YOU TOMORROW
