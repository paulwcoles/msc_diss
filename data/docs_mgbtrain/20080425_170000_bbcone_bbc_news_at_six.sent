GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO THE 
B. B. C. NEWS A PLANNED STRIKE BY 
WORKERS AT THE GRANGEMOUTH OIL 
REFINERY THIS WEEKEND IS ALREADY 
HAVING AN IMPACT THE REFINERY IS 
CLOSED AHEAD OF THE WALK OUT B. P. 
SAYS IT WILL SHUT DOWN THE PIPELINE 
WHICH BRINGS ASHORE MORE THAN A 
THIRD OF THE OIL INTO THE U. K. IN A 
MOMENT WE WILL MORE FROM THE 
BUSINESSES BUSINESSES B. P.'S PLANT IS A SMALL PART OF THE 
GRANGEMOUTH COMPLEX IT HAS ASSUMED 
A SIGNIFICANCE FAR BEYOND THE SIZE 
IN A BITTER INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE 
WHICH THREATENS TO DISRUPT 
BRITAIN'S OIL SUPPLIES THIS IS THE 
FORTIES PIPE LINE SYSTEM BELIEVES 
DELIVERS THE OIL YOU CAN'T SEE IT 
BECAUSE I. E. S. BURIED BENEATH US 
THOUSANDS OF TONNES OF CRUDE OIL IS 
FLOWING FROM THE NORTH SEA INTO THE 
PLANT BEHIND ME THAT'S WHERE IT'S 
STABILISED AND EITHER SENT TO 
GRANGEMOUTH OR FOR EXPORT NEARLY 
HALF OF THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF OIL 
COMES HERE WHEN IT COMES FROM THE 
NORTH SEA IT'S FULL OF SAND OIL 
AND OTHER IMPURITIES WHICH HAVE TO 
BE SETTLED OUT B. P. RELIES ON THE 
GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY TO HELP IT 
PROCESS THE OIL AND GAS FROM AROUND 
SEVENTY PLATFORMS THE RE FINERY 
PROVIDES THE POWER FOR THE SYSTEM 
IT CARRIES SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND BARRELS OF OIL A 
DAY MORE THAN A THIRD OF BRITAIN'S 
OIL PRODUCTION AS WELL AS THIRTY PER CENT OF U. K. 
GAS PRODUCTION 
THE SINGEST BIGGEST 
LOSER IS GOING TO BE THE GOVERNMENT 
THE EXCHEQUER BECAUSE OIL AND GAS 
IN U. K. PAYS HIGH TAX THAT WILL BE 
TWENTY FIVE BILLION A MILLION A DAY LOST 
OVER ONE MILLION AN HOUR THE THE GRANGEMOUTH PLANT HAS STOPPED 
PRODUCTION THE OWNERS SAY THEY 
DIDN'T WANT A DISPUTE BUT NEED TO 
MAKE CHANGES TO SAFEGUARD THE 
FUTURE 
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE FUTURE GRANGEMOUTH IS PROFITABLE FOR THE 
LONG TERM TO PROVIDE JOBS NOT JUST 
FOR PEOPLE TODAY BUT THE FUTURE TO 
TO DO THAT IT'S IMPORTANT WE INVEST 
THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN THE SITE AND 
MODERN SIZE THE PENSION SCHEME AS AS ANGRY WORKERS LEFT THE SITE THEY 
SAID THEY WERE DETERMINED TO MAKE 
THE PROTEST BLAMING THE COMPANY 
FOR THE DISPUTE 
IT WAS VERY GOOD 
VERY GOOD ON THE MEMBERS PART YOU YOU ARE DETERMINED TO GO AHEAD WITH THE 
STRIKE 
IT'S NOT SO MUCH GO AHEAD STRIKE BUT THE COMPANY'S PUT US IN A 
POSITION WE CAN'T TURN ALL I'LL 
SAY 
WHAT WAS THE MOOD LIKE VERY SAY VERY GOOD 
DETERMINED TO GO AHEAD WITH GOOD THE STRIKE YES 
MINISTERS ARE YES URGING THE TWO SIDES TO MEET AGAIN 
HOPING THERE MAY BE TIME TO FIND 
SETTLEMENT IN THE DISPUTE BUT THAT 
SEEMS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY LET'S 
TALK TO ANDY YOU SAID THE 
POSSIBILITIES OF THE STRIKE BEING 
CALLED OFF 
EXTREMELY 
UNLIKELY 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN PRACTICE IT IT SEEMS BOTH SIDES KEEP SAYING THE 
DOOR IS OPENING OPEN THEY ARE 
WILLING TO COME TO THE TABLE TO 
TALK THERE ISN'T SEEM ANYONE TO 
BRING THE SIDES TOGETHER SINCE THE 
TALKS BROKE DOWN IN LONDON EARLIER 
THIS WEEK THE MINISTERS IN 
SCOTLAND AND WESTMINSTER ARE 
DESPERATE FOR AN ELEVENTH HOUR 
INTERVENTION IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE 
IT WILL HAPPEN THE EARLIER 
DEADLINE REGARDING THE FORTIES PINE 
PIPELINE SYSTEM EARLIER THAT 
WILL BE HAVE THE PREPARATIONS FOR 
CLOSING IT UNDER WAY WE'RE TOLD 
THERE AREN'T EFFORTS TO AVOID THAT 
OR FIND A SOLUTION TO KEEP IT OPEN 
IF IT CLOSES IT WILL HAVE A HUGE 
AFFECT FOR A FEW DAYS IF NOT A WEEK 
ON OIL SUPPLIES YOU GET THE 
IMPRESSION THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF 
BRINKMANSHIP HERE AND BOTH SIDES IT 
SEEMS 
ARE REFUSING TO BLINK POLICE POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING THE MURDER OF A 
SEVERELY DISABLED MAN HAVE RELEASED 
THE TWO MEN THEY HAVE QUESTIONED 
ABOUT HIS DEATH THE BODY OF JAMES 
HUGHES WAS FOUND ON WEDNESDAY LESS 
THAN FORTY EIGHT HOURS AFTER HIS MOTHER'S 
BODY WAS FOUND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE 
INVESTIGATION 
THE KEY TO THIS INVESTIGATION INVESTIGATION NOW IS ESTABLISHING 
EXACTLY HOW JAMES DIED AND EQUALLY 
IMPORTANTLY WHETHER BECAUSE A POST 
MORTIM EXAMINATION THE RESULTS OF 
WHICH WERE RELEASED TODAY HAS 
FAILED TO ANSWER BOTH OF THOSE 
QUESTIONS THE ONLY REASON THAT THE 
BODY FOUND HERE COULD BE POSITIVELY 
IDENTIFIED AS BEING THAT OF JAMES 
WAS THROUGH HIS DENTAL RECORDS 
FURTHER TESTS ARE GOING TO BE 
CARRIED OUT ON THE BODY WE'RE TOLD 
THAT THE RESULTS OF THOSE TESTS 
COULD BE SEVERAL WEEKS AWAY WHAT 
POLICE ARE DOING THEY ARE STOPPING 
PEOPLE ON THE STREETS AS THEY TRY 
AND BUILD UP A PICTURE OF THE 
LIFESTYLE OF JAMES AND HIS MOTHER 
HEATHER WARDLE THEY HAVE BEEN 
SHOWING PEOPLE PICTURES OF THE PAIR 
ASKING THEM WHEN IT WAS THEY WERE 
LAST SEEN ONE OF THE THEORIES OF 
COURSE IS THAT THE BODY OF JAMES 
WAS HERE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS 
POSSIBLY BEFORE IT WAS FOUND 
THOUGH THE POLICE AREN'T 
COMEPBLTING ON THAT NOW THERE HAS 
BEEN A TRIBUTE TODAY FROM JAMES' 
FATHER PAUL WHO DESCRIBED HIS SON

BEHAVIOUR TWO MEN AGED TWENTY ONE 
VIGILANTE MOOD OVER A STOLEN BIKE 
WHO BROUGHT SHANE OWOO TO THIS CLAY 
PIT THE WATERS DESCRIBED AS SO 
DEEP THAT VEHICLES ARE SUBMERGED 
WITHIN THEY FORCED HIM TO CARRY 
OUT A PURBT PUNISHMENT SWIM HE 
TRIED TO GET OUT THEY WOULD NOT 
LET HIM HE WAS NOT STRONG 
SWIMMER THERE WAS ANGER OF 
SENTENCE OF FIVE YEARS FOR MURDER

DON'T THINK FIVE AND A HALF YEARS 
IS LONG ENOUGH 
BY RIGHTS THEY

HAVE HAD DONE TO THEM WHAT THEY 
DONE TO SHANE 
THE MOST OF THE ONE 
OF THOSE CONVICTED SAID HER SON WAS 
TRULY REMORSEFUL AND URGED 
FORGIVENESS FEW COULD UNDERSTAND 
HOW THE BIKE COULD LEAD TO A DEATH

ISRAELI AGENTS OPERATEDING INSIDE 
SYRIA CLOSE UP PROOF SAYS THE C. I. A.

PEACEFUL PURPOSE THE C. I. A. SAYS THE 
DESIGN OF SYRIA'S PLANT MATCHES 
NORTH KOREA'S NOTE THE SIMILAR 
ARRANGEMENT OF THE VERT REACTOR ON

NUCLEAR SCIENTIST WAS WORKING WITH 
THE COUNTERPART ON THE RIGHT IT 
TOOK NO CHANCES LAST YEAR ISRAEL 
CARRIED OUT A OPERATION THAT 
FLATTENED WHAT WAS IN THE DESERT 
THE SYRIANS WERE QUICK TO BULLDOZE 
OVER THE REMAINS FURTHER PROOF 
SAYS THE C. I. A. THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO 
HIDE 
HIDE FOR THE C. I. A. TO COME OUT 
PUBLICLY WITH THE ALLEGATIONS THEY 
MUST BE PRETTY SURE THEY HAVE IT 
RIGHT THIS TIME DESPITE THE 
APPARENTLY CONVINCING EVIDENCE IT'S 
HARD TO FORGET THE INTELLIGENCE 
BLUNDERS MADE AROUND FIVE YEARS AGO

ANY KIND OF THIS NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY 
IS DEFINITELY NOT IN SYRIA'S 
INTEREST TO ACHIEVE PEACE AND 
STABILITY IN THE REGION RELEASING RELEASING THESE CLASSIFIED PICTURES HAS UPSET 
THE UN WHOSE OFFICIALS SAY THEY

OPERATING ON LONDONERS AND THE

FOR THAT AND THE REST OF THE DAY'S 
NEWS AT SIX HUNDRED THIRTY 
NOW LAST WEEK WE REPORTED ON PRICE 
FIXING IN THE HOUSE BUILDING SECTOR 
TODAY IT'S THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY 
THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING IS 
INVESTIGATING WHETHER IMPERIAL 
TOBACCO AND GALLACHER AND ELEVEN 
RETAILERS INCLUDING TESCO AND 
SAINSBURY COLLUDED TO FIX PRICES 
HERE'S HUGH PYM WITH THE DETAILS 
THE INQUIRY HAS RAISED SOME 
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT SORT OF DEAL 
SMOKERS GET IMPERIAL TOBACCO AND 
GALLAGHER WHO OF THE BIG 
MANUFACTURER ARE ACCUSED OF ACTING 
UNLAWFULLY IT IS ALLEGED THERE WAS 
PRICE CO ORDINATION OVER A THREE 
YEAR PERIOD HERE ARE SOME OF THE 
BRANDS ELEVEN RETAILERS WHO SELL 
TOBACCO PRODUCTS FACE THE SAME 
ALLEGATIONS SO WHAT ARE THEY 
ACCUSED OF DOING IT IS ALLEGED 
THAT CIGARETTE MANUFACTURERS WOULD 
TELL THE RETAILERS THOUSAND PRICE 
THEIR PRODUCTS A MANUFACTURER 
MAKING BRAND X. WOULD SAY THE PRICE 
HAD TO BE THE SAME AS OR SIMILAR 
THE THAT OF BRAND Y. MADE BAY RIVAL 
COMPANY THE POINT BEING THAT 
RETAILERS' FREEDOM TO SET PRICES 
WAS RESTRICTED IT IS ALLEGED THAT 
SOME OF THE RETAILERS AND THE 
TOBACCO GIANTS INDIRECTLY EXCHANGED 
INFORMATION ABOUT PRICE PLANS IT 
SUGGESTS CUSTOMERS WERE OVERCHARGED 
AS A RESULT OF THE PRACTICES AND 
ALLEGATIONS WHICH SAY ABOUT 
INFORMATION EXCHANGE IT IS LIKELY 
SMOKERS PAID MORE OVER THAT PERIOD 
OF TIME 
HOW DO SMOKERS REACT TO 
THAT 
IT DOES NOT ENCOURAGE THAT COMPETITION IT GETS FROM A SMOKER 
POINT OF VIEW IF THEY ARE SETTING 
THEM AT HIGHER PRICES THEN IT IS 
GOING TO PUSH PRICES UP 
IT WOULD 
MAKE ME ANGRY IF IT WAS TRUE YES 
BUT IT WOULDN'T STOP ME SMOKING 
THIS TIME IT IS CIGARETTES LAST 
WEEK CONSTRUCTION A FEW WEEKS AGO 
MILK PRICES HERE ARE SOME 
REACTIONS FROM COMPANIES FACING THE 
ACCUSATIONS 
REACTIONS FROM COMPANIES FACING THE ACCUSATIONS TESCO SAID THE 
INVESTIGATION APPEARED TO CENTRE ON 
MAJOR TOBACCO COMPANIES THE 
COMPANIES HAVE CHANCE TO MAKE 
THEIR CASE THE OFFICE OF FAIR 
TRADING HAS TO DECIDE THEN WHETHER 
THE BURNING QUESTIONS SHOULD RESULT 
IN FINES WHICH COULD RUN TO 
HUNDREDS OF 
MILLIONS YOU CAN KEEP

FIFTY BULLETS AS HE LEFT A CLUB TWO 
OF THE POLICEMEN HAD FACED 
MANSLAUGHTER CHARGES FROM NEW YORK 
HERE'S HEATHER ALEXANDER THEIR 
FEELINGS ARE CLEAR DISMAY AND 
DISBELIEF IN THE CROWD AFTER THE 
VERDICTS WERE READ OUT A FAMILY 
DISTRAUGHT AFTER A JUDGE DECIDED 
THE POLICE HAD DONE NOTHING WRONG 
IN FIRING FIFTY SHOTS AT THEIR UNARMED 
SON THIS WAS THE SCENE JUST 
MINUTES AFTER IT HAPPENED SEAN 
BELL'S FRIENDS LIE INJURED HE WAS 
DEAD BUT IT IS WHAT HAPPENED 
BEFORE THAT TA THE JUDGE RULED ON 
PROSECUTOR CLAIMED THESE POLICE 
OFFICERS WERE TRIGGER HAPPY AND 
OPENED FIRE WUET WARNING BUT THE 
DEFENCE PREVAILED SAYING THEY 
BELIEVED THEIR LIVES WERE IN DANGER 
BECAUSE ONE MAN HAD SAID GO GET

BEEN ACQUITTED 
WHEN YOU ARE IN 
FRONT OF A COURT HOUSE AND IN FRONT 
OF THAT COURT BENCH THAT YOU WILL 
GET FAIRNESS 
NO WORDS FROM THE 
FAMILY JUST A MOMENT OF SILENCE AT 
HIS GRAVESIDE THIS IS A CITY WITH 
A HISTORY OF RACIAL TENSIONS OVER 
POLICE SHOOTINGS AND THERE WERE 
PROTESTS IN THE RUN UP TO THIS CASE 
CALLING FOR JUSTICE THE POLICE 
WILL FEEL THEY HAVE THEIR JUSTICE 
BUT THE WIDER COMMUNITY MAY NOT 
AGREE AROUND A THOUSAND WOMEN 
ACROSS THE U. K. DIE EACH YEAR FROM 
CERVICAL CANCER A VACCINE TO HELP 
PROTECT YOUNG GIRLS HAS BEEN 
PILOTED BUT RESEARCHERS SAY ONE IN 
THREE PARENTS DID NOT WANT THEIR 
DAUGHTERS TO HAVE IT THIS VACCINE 
COULD HELP SAVE LIVES THESE GIRLS 
FROM KINGS WAY SCHOOL ARE THE 
LATEST TO RECEIVE IT ALMOST THREE THOUSAND 
GIRLS HAVE BEEN OFFERED THE VACCINE 
IT IS A PILOT BUT MOST PARENTS OF 
STUDENTS HAVE WELCOMED IT 
I WOULD 
SAY TO RESEARCH AND IF ANYTHING 
WITH ANY TRIAL THERE WILL BE 
QUESTIONS AT THE BACK OF YOUR MIND 
BUT I BELIEVE THAT IT IS TRUE THAT 
THEY SHOULD HAVE IT AND IT IS A 
GOOD THING L. WOULD CO IT DO IT AGAIN 
I FOUND IT PAINFUL I FIRST AGAIN I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT BUT THEN MY 
MUM TOLD ME IT WAS IMPORTANT AND I 
DIDN'T WANT TO GET CANCER 
BUT NOT 
ALL GIRLS WILL HAVE THE VACCINE 
NOT ALL PARENTS ARE CONVINCED BY IT 
THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF NEWNESS 
ABOUT IT WHEN SOMETHING NEW COMES 
IN MEDICINE PEOPLE DO I THINK WANT 
TO REFLECT ON IT AND SOMETIMES THEY 
HAVE UNCERTAINTIES BUT I DO STRESS 
THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE COME TO TERMS 
WITH IT OR WILL DO OVER TIME IN IN THE STUDY ALMOST A THIRD OF PARENTS 
EITHER DIDN'T RESPOND OR REFUSED TO 
GIVE PERMISSION FOR THEIR DAUGHTER 
TO HAVE THE VACCINE THAT MEANT THIRTY PER CENT 
DIDN'T GET IT OF THOSE WHO 
WOULDN'T GIVE CONSENT THEIR MAIN 
CONCERNS WERE INSUFFICIENT 
INFORMATION TO HELP THEM MAKE A 
DECISION SAFETY AND THE AGE AT 
WHICH THE VACCINE IS GIVEN ONLY A 
MINORITY QUESTIONED THE VACCINE'S 
EFFECT ON SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR THE 
VACCINE HAS TO BE ISSUED IN THREE 
STAGES RESEARCHERS SAID THE
