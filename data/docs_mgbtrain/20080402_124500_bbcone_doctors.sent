HE USED TO BE SO STRONG 
THIS ISN'T THE MAN I KNEW THIS IS SOMEONE ELSE 
I NEED TO LISTEN TO HIS CHEST 
ARE YOU RELIGIOUS DOCTOR NOT PARTICULARLY NO 
THE ONE THING HE FEARED WAS DIVINE RETRIBUTION 
HE SMILED BEFORE HE WENT TO SLEEP 
CONVINCED HE WAS ABOUT TO MEET HIS MAKER AND I SMILED BACK 
EQUALLY CONVINCED HE WASN'T 
I'M AFRAID TO SAY THAT HE'S SHOWING SYMPTOMS OF SEVERE PNEUMONIA 
PERHAPS I'LL OPEN A WINDOW

IN THAT CASE I'LL POUR YOU YOUR NEXT DRINK 
HOW'S THE FILM CAREER GOING

OH POOR PHOEBE 
THE YEARS SLIP BY AND THOSE DOE EYES LOSE THEIR SPARKLE 
YOU ARE SO LIKE DADDY IN SO MANY WAYS 
DON'T TAKE ME ON PHOEBE YOU'LL NEVER WIN 
IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEASE AND DESPERATE TO BE ADMIRED 
STEALING A SISTER'S HUSBAND NOW THAT'S DESPERATE 
I THINK I'LL CHANGE BEFORE I SEE HIM 
THERE'S NO HOPE OF OUR RECONCILIATION IF THAT'S WHAT YOU CAME FOR 
YOU KNOW YOU COULD TRY AND FORGIVE ME 
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE COME 
WHY DON'T YOU CATCH ANOTHER PLANE AND WE'LL TRY AND FORGET THAT THIS LITTLE REUNION EVER HAPPENED 
HE SAID WHAT 
IF HE WAS THE LAST GUY ON EARTH 
OH O. K. I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE LATE 
NO NO NOTHING IMPORTANT 
JUST WANTED TO HEAR YOUR VOICE 
SAY HI TO EVERYONE YEAH 
MISS YOU MORE 
KELLY THERE WAS SOMETHING 
WELL 
YOUR FATHER HAS DETERIORATED 
I KNOW THAT HE GAVE STRICT INSTRUCTIONS 
HE WANTED TO DIE AT HOME 
AND DADDY ALWAYS GETS WHAT HE WANTS 
I HAVE AN OBLIGATION AS HIS G. P. TO RECOMMEND HOSPITAL 
WHAT'S THE POINT HE'S GOING TO DIE ANYWAY 
HE COULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE 
THE MAN'S IN A COMA IT'S NOT AS IF HE CAN FEEL ANYTHING 
BUT HE'S YOUR FATHER MORE'S THE PITY 
AND HE'S MY PATIENT YOU DON'T KNOW HIM 
I KNOW THAT HE INSPIRED PEOPLE AND I KNOW THAT CHILDREN TREASURE HIS BOOKS 
HIS BOOKS MACABRE FAIRY STORIES 
TWISTED MORALITY TALES WITH DIVERTING ILLUSTRATIONS 
THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT TIME TO IT'S THE PERFECT TIME 
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE REVERED RICHARD HARRINGTON 
HE IS A WORK OF FICTION HE WAS THE WORST PARENT ANYONE COULD WISH FOR 
THAT'S ENOUGH COULDN'T THIS BE THE TIME TO MAKE YOUR PEACE 
AND LET HIM DIE WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE 
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE 
BUT YOU'VE COME ALL THIS WAY 
THIS HOUSE IT SUCKS THE LIFE OUT OF EVERYBODY 
SHE'S SCARED 
ALWAYS A DRAMA 
HOW CAN YOU BE SO POISONOUS 
IT'S A GIFT 
IF YOU LEAVE WITHOUT SEEING HIM YOU'LL ALWAYS REGRET IT 
ISABEL WAS RIGHT I AM SCARED 
MAYBE IF YOU WERE IN THERE WITH ME 
O. K. 
HE WOULD HAVE LEFT YOU FOR SOMEONE SOONER OR LATER 
AT LEAST I HAVE A REASON FOR HATING PHOEBE 
SHE MADE FOOLS OF ALL OF US 
YOU'RE JEALOUS NONSENSE 
YOU ALWAYS HAVE BEEN BECAUSE YOU'RE PLAIN AND SHE ISN'T 
IT'S ALL RIGHT FOR YOU ISABEL 
CAMBRIDGE FIRST AND THEN SPARKLING CAREER I GOT LEFT BEHIND 
AND PHOEBE COMPROMISED YOUR SPLENDID ISOLATION 
SHE WAS BORN AND I WAS OVERLOOKED FROM THEN ON IN 
I USED TO READ MY DAUGHTER YOUR FATHER'S STORIES 
HIS IDEAS BOOK NEVER LETS IT OUT OF HIS SIGHT 
EVERYTHING BEGINS IN HERE 
I WAS THE GIRL WHO WOULD NEVER SIT STILL 
WITH IMPOSSIBLE HAIR AND SEA GREEN EYES 
I GREW UP WHICH WAS VIEWED AS RATHER INCONVENIENT SO I REBELLED 
MOST OF US DO 
UNSUITABLE BOYFRIENDS AND WEEKEND BENDERS 
I SEDUCED MY BROTHER IN LAW TO DESTROY ISABEL 
SWEETNESS AND JOY AND DANGEROUSLY COY 
YOU KNOW DOCTOR HE DISOWNED ME FOR DARING TO STAND UP TO HIM 
I'VE DONE MY GRIEVING 
I LOST MY FATHER SEVEN YEARS AGO
