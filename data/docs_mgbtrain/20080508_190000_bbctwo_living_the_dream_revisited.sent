FOUR YEARS AGO LIVING THE DREAM FOLLOWED THE FYFE FAMILY 
FROM NOTTINGHAM WHEN THEY SOLD THEIR HOMES AND GAVE UP THEIR JOBS FOR A FRESH START IN PORTUGAL 
SUE AND GRAEME INVESTED THEIR LIFE'S SAVINGS OF THIRTY THREE YEARS 
TO OPEN A RESTAURANT BAR IN THE ALGARVE 
WITH THEIR SON SIMON AND DAUGHTER IN LAW MANDIE PINT OF FOSTERS 
I WANT TO SIT IN THE SUN RELAX 
GET MY HEALTH TOGETHER AND HAVE A JOLLY GOOD TIME 
TODAY THE BAR IS STILL IN BUSINESS 
BUT IT'S RUNNING WITH ONLY HALF THE ORIGINAL TEAM 
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A HATRED OF THE LIFESTYLE IT BROUGHT YOU 
TO COME BACK AS I DID 
I WOULD NEVER EVER GIVE IT A GO AGAIN 
THE TIME THAT I NEEDED MY MUM AND DAD THEY GOT ON A PLANE AND OFF BACK TO ENGLAND 
AND I HATED WHAT I WAS DOING BUT WHAT COULD I DO 
WHAT ELSE COULD I DO 
I JUST LEFT 
THE FYFES' JOURNEY BEGAN FOUR YEARS AGO DURING A LAST MINUTE FAMILY HOLIDAY TO THE ALGARVE 
WHEN SUE AND GRAEME STUMBLED ACROSS THE MONA LISA BAR 
WHICH WAS UP FOR SALE 
ON IMPULSE THEY PUT IN AN OFFER IT WAS TO PROVE TO BE A DECISION THAT DIVIDED THE FAMILY 
THE MONA LISA WILL COST THE FYFES SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND 
GRAEME WILL RAISE SEVENTY PER CENT OF THIS BY SELLING HIS NOTTINGHAM BUNGALOW WHICH IS ALREADY UNDER OFFER 
AND AS HE'S PUTTING UP MOST OF THE MONEY HE HOPES TO TAKE A BACKSEAT ROLE 
LEAVING THE HARD WORK TO THE REST OF THE FAMILY 
I'VE HAD TWO STROKES TO DATE WHICH WAS DUE TO HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE STRESS WHATEVER 
I'M FIFTY FIVE AND I'M GONNA SLOW DOWN I'M GONNA RETIRE 
PORTUGAL IS REGARDED IN EUROPE AS THE LAZIEST COUNTRY 
NOW THAT SUITS ME DOWN TO THE GROUND 
SUE A NURSE HAS NEVER COOKED PROFESSIONALLY 
AND WILL HAVE TO LEARN ON THE JOB 
UNTIL WE HAVE A GOOD BASH AT A WEEK OF DOING IT WE WON'T REALLY KNOW 
I'M PRESUMING YOU'RE GOING TO BE OVER A GRIDDLE SWEATING YOUR FAN ON 
AND YOU'RE COOKING YOUR CHEESEBURGERS AND YOUR FISH AND CHIPS 
AND THEN AT NIGHT IT'S A CALMER PACE WHERE YOU GET DRESSED UP NICE 
AND YOU'RE THE HOST DOWNSTAIRS IN THE BAR SLASH RESTAURANT 
FOR ROBIN HOOD 
SIMON WORKS AS A MANAGER AT THE TALES OF ROBIN HOOD BANQUETING HALL 
HE PUTS IN EIGHTY HOURS A WEEK AND HAS WORKED FOR THE SAME COMPANY SINCE HE WAS SIXTEEN 
ARE WE HAPPY 
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF WORKING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE BOLLOCKS TO THEM 
NOW I'M GOING TO BE THE ONE DRIVING THE MERC 
THANK YOU MY LORDS AND LADIES 
HIS WIFE MANDIE WORKS WEEKENDS AS HEAD SERVING WENCH 
JUST TO SPEND TIME WITH SIMON 
ONCE WE'RE OUT IN PORTUGAL HE'LL BE ABLE TO SPEND MORE QUALITY TIME WITH THE CHILDREN AND WITH ME 
COS I JUST WANT TO SEE HIM AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S A CRIME AT ALL 
OH 
AS GRAEME AND SUE THINK THEY'VE SOLD THEIR BUNGALOW THEY THROW THEIR LEAVING PARTY 
IT IS NOW DEFINITELY ON 
YOU ARE GETTTING RID OF US 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE MILLIONS WE JUST WANT A QUIET AREN'T WE 
NICE LIFE NO WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE MILLIONS FIRST ARGUMENT 
WE'RE GONNA BE IN THE WARM 
THE MONA LISA HAS BEEN RUN FOR SIXTEEN YEARS BY JO RICHARDS 
SHE'S KEEN TO SELL UP 
THIS IS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME 
I AM JUST GLAD I AM NOT PAYING YOU TO DO MY BUSINESS 
GRAEME HAS ALREADY PUT DOWN AN EIGHT THOUSAND DEPOSIT 
UNDER PORTUGUESE LAW HE MUST PAY JO THE BALANCE BY THE END OF JUNE OR LOSE HIS MONEY 
RIGHT THIS IS MEETING NUMBER THREE OF THE MONA LISA OR BUST ASSOCIATION 
YOU'VE ALL HAD THE PREVIOUS MINUTES DO YOU TAKE THEM AS ACCEPTED YEAH 
THE MAIN ITEM ON THE AGENDA IS SIMON'S PLAN TO CUT COSTS BY SACKING THE BAR'S FIVE STAFF 
AS REGARDS STAFFING LEVELS IF WE'RE GOING TO GET ON TO THAT ARGUMENT AGAIN 
STAFFING LEVELS WITH THAT STERN LOOK AS IF I'VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG RIGHT SIMON 
I'M NOT SAYING GO IN SACK EVERYBODY START OVER AGAIN 
I'M NOT PREPARED TO TAKE ANYBODY OFF THE STREET WHO'S WALKING BY 
NO NO I'M NOT SAYING THAT AN IMMIGRANT A PORTUGUESE PERSON OUT OF WORK 
WHERE YOU GONNA GET YOUR STAFF FROM YOU STILL NEED A COUPLE OF PART TIME STAFF 
WE'RE DISCUSSING VILLAS AT THE MOMENT WE'LL DISCUSS THAT WHEN WE GET ON TO THE STAFF PROBLEM 
I'M SURE YOU CAN COOK A COUPLE OF BURGERS AND A COUPLE OF CHICKEN AND CHIPS YEAH 
SO THEN WHY DOES SHE PAY FIVE STAFF THEN 
COS SHE'S A DONGO CHRIST 
THE BUDGET ALLOWS FOR SOMEONE IT DOESN'T COS I'VE LOOKED AT YOUR FIGURES 
YEAH YOU'LL HAVE LOADS OF MONEY YOU'RE FIVE THOUSAND OVER THE BUDGET 
WELL I'VE ALLOWED FOR THEM WHERE YOU GONNA GET THE FIVE THOUSAND FROM 
DON'T BE SO STUPID EVEN YOUR CAR WOULDN'T FETCH THAT 
SIMON AND HIS FAMILY ARE READY TO GO 
HE AND MANDIE HAVE ELEVEN THOUSAND 
WHICH MUST COVER THEIR SHARE OF THE BAR AND LIVING EXPENSES 
MOST OF THE MONEY FROM THE DEAL WILL COME FROM THE SALE OF GRAEME AND SUE'S BUNGALOW 
SUDDENLY THERE'S BAD NEWS FROM THEIR BUYER 
OUT OF THE BLUE SHE'S WITHDRAWN THE ORIGINAL OFFER 
AND DROPPED THE PRICE FIVE THOUSAND COS SHE KNOWS WE'RE IN A VULNERABLE POSITION 
THE WORST THING IS I JUST FEEL 
I JUST FEEL LIKE I'VE LET SIMON DOWN 
HE'S GOING OUT THERE NEXT WEEK ON WEDNESDAY NO JOB NOTHING 
GRAEME AND SUE RELUCTANTLY AGREE TO A THREE THOUSAND PRICE DROP 
AS LONG AS THE DEAL IS COMPLETED IN THREE WEEKS 
THREE AND A NIGHT BED YEAH THREE AND A NAPPY CHANGING BAG 
DESPITE THE SET BACK SIMON KEEPS HIS NERVE AND FLIES OUT 
HE AND MANDIE HAVE NO HOME NO BUSINESS AND NO INCOME 
THREE WEEKS THREE WEEKS 
GOODBYE OLD MAN GOODBYE SEE YOU SOON 
THREE WEEKS WE'LL BE IN THE SAME BOAT 
SEE YA SEE YA 
GRAEME AND SUE ARE STUCK IN NOTTINGHAM TO ENSURE THEIR BUNGALOW IS SOLD 
WITHOUT THAT THEY CAN'T BUY THE BAR 
FOUR HOURS LATER SIMON AND HIS FAMILY ARE SAVOURING LIFE ON THE ALGARVE 
I CAN'T RUN IN SAND HOT 
CHUCK HER IN 
SHE'S DANCING SHE IS ISN'T SHE WHEE

I'M BREAKING IT DOWN BACK INTO POUNDS YOU SHOULDN'T

THREE DAYS LATER AND THIRTY THREE YEARS OF SUE AND GRAEME'S LIFE SAVINGS FINALLY LANDS IN JO'S ACCOUNT 
SIX AND A HALF MONTHS AFTER SEEING THE BAR THE FYFES FINALLY MAKE IT THEIR OWN 
YOU ENJOY THE REST I WILL 
THE QUEST FOR THE BAR OVER GRAEME IS ABOUT TO UNLOCK THE SECRETS OF THE MONA LISA 
ONE GIANT STEP FOR MANKIND 
THOSE ARE MY DADDY'S KEYS 
FIRST PINT 
I THINK GRAEME WILL BE THE MAJOR SORRY 
GRAEME WILL BE THE WHAT 
GRAEME WILL BE THE SLEEPING PARTNER WHO DOES ABSOLUTELY BUGGER ALL 
WALKS UP AND DOWN OUTSIDE AND FEEDS THE DOGS 
I THINK YOU NEED SOMEBODY WITH A BIT OF A STRONGER CHARACTER 
WHO THROUGH THE WHOLE OF THIS PROJECT HAS SHOWN HIS LEADERSHIP ABILITY 
OH THAT WOULD BE YOU THEN SIMON I WEREN'T THINKING OF ME 
BUT SEEING AS YOU'VE JUST RECOMMENDED ME 
I WONDER WHO THAT COULD BE 
I ELECT MYSELF 
AS SOON AS WE GET THE BAR YOU TURN UP 
YOU SEE HOW GRAEME IS THE MANAGING DIRECTOR 
ORDER ORDER 
WHO'S THE BOSS HERE WHO'S THE BOSS HERE WHO'S THE BOSS 
NOW I HAVE A PROPOSAL TO PUT FORWARD AS MANAGING DIRECTOR 
RIGHTY HO THAT WE CLOSE TOMORROW GET EVERYTHING REVAMPED 
READY FOR OPENING ON FRIDAY MORNING AT NINE O'CLOCK 
AND TO BE HONEST I'M ABSOLUTELY DRAINED 
THEY VOTE TO CLOSE AND REDECORATE DESPITE THE RICH PICKINGS ON OFFER IN HIGH SEASON 
AS WELL AS REDECORATING THE FYFES MUST FIND TIME TO CELEBRATE INDYA'S BIRTHDAY 
EVERYTHING'S FINE AS LONG AS THE KIDS STAY AWAY STAY AWAY 
NEED THE MONEY WE NEED TO GET TODAY ALL THE JOBS DONE 
GET IT CLEARED OUT GET IT NICE GET IT TIDY 
AND THEN TOMORROW MORNING HIT THE GROUND RUNNING NINE A M. 
ER AS YOU CAN SEE WE'RE GONNA BE HERE ALL DAY PUTTING COAT AFTER COAT ON THIS 
IT'LL REACH SO 
DO YOU WANT ME TO GET UP THERE NO I CAN STAND ON THEM TWO PLANKS 
YOU'RE THE PAINTER 
TRY A BLACK SORT OF JUST PAINT 
JUST PAINT 
WAIT TILL IT'S FINISHED THEN YOU CAN GO 
THAT LOOKS SHIT TEAR IT DOWN IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT ON THE NIGHT 
HARD WANTING TO BE A HERO ISN'T IT HOW MANY DAFT WEIRD THINGS WITH WEIRD OBJECTS 
NOT AS MANY AS I HAVE I WAS A WINDOW DRESSER FOR EIGHT YEARS 
AND SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE DONE MATEY 
NOW YOU KNOW WHY IT SAYS WET PAINT 
THIS IS WHAT I DIDN'T WANT TO HAPPEN 
I WANTED IT TO LOOK FAIRLY PROFESSIONAL 
NOT LIKE A CRAP MAKEOVER THAT YOU'VE DONE IN TWO MINUTES 
I DON'T WANT IT TO OPEN AND LOOK NAFF 
WHAT'S UP WHAT'S THE MATTER 
ALTHOUGH SIMON HAS HAD SEVEN WEEKS OFF WORK 
AND HAS SPENT ALL OF HIS SAVINGS HE WANTS TO GO HOME AFTER THE PARTY AND FINISH REDECORATING TOMORROW 
I'M SAYING THAT YOU CAN'T OPEN TOMORROW 
MY OPINION IS NOT TO OPEN TOMORROW UNTIL WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING DONE PROPERLY 
I'D RATHER OPEN NICE THAN SHITE 
I KNOW BUT THE ROOF'S NOT DONE THAT'S NOT DONE I'M QUITE WILLING 
IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF WORKING TILL WHATEVER AS SOON AS IT GETS DARK YOU'VE GOT NO LIGHTS UP 
YEAH YOU'VE GOT ODD BITS OF RED THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PAINTED OVER SO WHAT TOUGH LUCK 
I DON'T MIND ARRIVING HERE AT SIX A M. PROVIDING IT'S LIGHT 
COUPLE OF HOURS DOING THAT 
IF YOU OPEN TOMORROW 
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO FINISH IT YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO FINISH IT 
YOU WON'T YOU WON'T FINISH IT 
BUT WOULDN'T SOME PEOPLE OPEN UP EVEN IF IT WASN'T FINISHED 
THEY WOULD WOULDN'T THEY I WOULDN'T 
I DON'T LIKE THIS IMPASSE 
SO WHILST WE NEED THE CASH MY VOTE WOULD BE 
IT'S NOT COSTING US ANY MONEY TO BE CLOSED 
MY VOTE WOULD BE TO KEEP IT CLOSED TOMORROW 
WE CAN GET AT IT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING 
AS LONG AS WE GET IT ALL DONE TOMORROW THEN YES DEFINITELY GET IT ALL DONE 
THAT'S A REASONABLE COMPROMISE ISN'T IT YEAH 
TODAY'S NOT GOING HOW I WANT IT 
WE'VE ALL WORKED HARD AND 
REALLY WANTED TO OPEN IT UP TOMORROW 
I'VE GOT TO STICK BY WHAT SIMON SAYS 
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO A GREAT BIG MASSIVE ARGUMENT 
YOU CAN PUT TEN COATS ON THAT LOT AND IT WOULD LOOK NO DIFFERENT TO NOW 
I THINK IT LOOKS GREAT BUT NO BUT WE NEED TO GET THE ROOF DONE WE NEED THE ELECTRICS DONE 
BUT HE CAN DO THE ROOF WE'VE GOT TILL TEN P. M. TO DO THE ROOF 
BUT HE WANTS TO GO HOME WITH HIS KIDS 
WHY DON'T HE BE HONEST AND SAY THAT NO LET HIM HAVE A SPECIAL DAY 
LET HIM HAVE A SPECIAL DAY SOME THINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO HIM SOME TO ME 
AT THE MOMENT I THOUGHT MONEY WAS IMPORTANT TO US DUCK 
WHEN HE SAYS HE'S GOT NO MONEY LEFT IN THE BANK DON'T MOAN AT ME 
BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE MADE ABOUT ONE THOUSAND TOMORROW 
WE'LL GET INDY'S PARTY OUT THE WAY 
AND TRY AND GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF BACK UP IF YOU CAN 
IF YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S SAYING IS 
IT'S DIFFICULT WE DON'T WANT ANY FAMILY DISPUTES 
IT'S INDY'S BIRTHDAY THAT'S THE MAIN I TELL YOU WHAT WHEN IT'S MY BIRTHDAY 
I'M NOT EVEN MOVING FOR THE COMPLETE DAY I'LL HAVE A WHALE OF A TIME 
SUE'S OUTVOTED AND THE BAR WILL REMAIN CLOSED 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
TWO DAYS LATER AND THE FYFES HOLD A GRAND REOPENING 
AND FINALLY SERVE THEIR FRY UPS TO THE ALGARVE PUBLIC 
WHAT'S TRIPPED OUT 
THE ELECTRICITY'S JUST TRIPPED OUT 
AND WITHOUT IT WE'VE GOT NO FACILITIES FOR COOKING 
THERE'S JUST THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE THEY OPEN 
WE'VE JUST PLUNGED INTO AN ABYSS OF DARKNESS 
IT'S COVERED IN BLOODY CACK 
YES IT'S ON IT'S ON 
THANK GOD SIMON 
IT GETS SO HOT IN THERE 
SIMON COMPROMISES ON STAFFING LEVELS AND ALLOWS ONE OF THE OLDER TEAM BACK

DONE COMPLETED 
AS THE ORDERS PILE UP SUE STARTS TO FEEL THE HEAT 
EIGHT TWO TWO 
MUM YOU CAN'T WAIT FIVE HOURS FOR IT THOUGH 
COS THEY'RE ENGLISH THEY'VE COME TO AN ENGLISH BAR SO THEY EXPECT AN ENGLISH STANDARD OF SERVICE 
LOSING CONTROL

MESA NUMBER ONE OH IT'S TWO TWO 
SUE'S ONLY COOKED HALF THE ORDER 
YEAH IT'S TWO YOU WANT FOR NUMBER ONE 
CALM DOWN CALM DOWN COME ON SORT IT OUT

YEAH BUT I WAS GOING TO CHUCK THAT IN NO IT'S ALL RIGHT 
I'VE JUST GOT TO STAND AND THINK FOR A MINUTE BECAUSE IT'S JUST GOING A BIT PEAR SHAPED 
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO BE DOING NEXT WHEN YOU'VE DONE THAT BREAKFAST 
THE OTHER BREAKFAST IS AT THE TOP OF THE OVEN KEEPING WARM 
DO YOU WANT ANY HELP PLEASE RIGHT 
CAN YOU GET SOME PRAWNS TWO LOTS OF PRAWNS 
AND A TUNA SALAD 
THEY'VE SURVIVED THE MORNING BUT ONLY JUST THEY'RE EXHAUSTED 
HELLO IS THAT VAL 
YEAH HELLO IT'S GRAEME FROM THE MONA LISA 
GRAEME DECIDES TO EAT HUMBLE PIE AND ASK THE OLD STAFF TO COME IN FOR A MEETING 
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOU CARRYING ON WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE 
CAN YOU COME ROUND AND TALK TO ME UM YES I'LL BE PASSING BY LATER ON GRAEME I'LL POP IN THEN 
STAFF WILL JUST STAND AROUND AND DO NOTHING 
THAT'S IT THAT'S THE KITCHEN 
THERE ISN'T ANYWHERE ELSE FOR ANYBODY ELSE TO GO 
WHAT'S THE OTHER PERSON GONNA DO THERE ISN'T ANYTHING FOR THEM TO DO 
WITHOUT CONSULTING SIMON GRAEME TAKES AN EXECUTIVE DECISION TO RE HIRE THE STAFF 
WE'VE GOT ANGELA BACK WE'VE GOT NO SECRETS 
WE'VE GIVEN HER A PAY INCREASE TO KEEP HER 
WE'VE RELIED ON HER TOTALLY TODAY AND WE'D LIKE TO TAKE THE SAME ATTITUDE WITH YOU 
WELL YEAH I WILL GIVE IT A TRY LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY THAT'S FINE 
I'D LIKE TO THINK IT OVER AND DISCUSS IT WITH MY HUSBAND 
YOU'RE WELCOME AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT 
YOU'RE JUST THROWING MONEY AWAY TAKES TWO MINUTES TO STICK SOME BLOODY PLASTIC CHAIRS OUT 
THERE'S A LOT TO DO BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE OH IS THERE

SO WHY DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THEM STAFF WHY CAN'T YOU PUT A SIGN UP 
THEY'RE TRIED AND TESTED THEY'RE NOT THEY STOOD AROUND WITH FACES LIKE THUNDER 
WE'D HAVE BEEN LOST WITHOUT ANGELA 
YEAH BUT WHEN YOU WRITE THE ROTA DON'T PUT THEM TOGETHER 
THEY WANT TO WORK TOGETHER 
COURSE THEY WANT TO WORK TOGETHER THEN THEY CAN SCHEME AND DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TRUST ME ON THIS 
MISMANAGEMENT 
MISCOMMUNICATION MY DAD'S JUST THINKING OH MY GOD WE'RE DESPERATE WE'RE DESPERATE 
SO WE'VE NOW GOT THE TWO PERSON DOING ONE JOB SCENARIO 
AND TOTALLY ARSED EVERYTHING UP BASICALLY 
YOU KNOW 
HAVING LOST THE STAFF BATTLE SIMON IS DETERMINED TO CUT OTHER COSTS 
THE MONA LISA HAS AN EXCELLENT REPUTATION FOR FRESHLY BATTERED FISH AND CHIPS 
BUT BY USING CHEAPER ALREADY BATTERED FISH SIMON CAN SAVE TWENTY FIVE CENTS PER MEAL 
I DON'T THINK IT MAKES TOO MUCH DIFFERENCE 
WHETHER IT'S HOMEMADE OR NOT 
THE AMOUNT OF FART ARSING AROUND YOU DO TO MAKE IT TO BATTER IT TO LOVE IT TO CUDDLE IT 
WITH THE READY BATTERED ONE YOU STICK IT IN THE FRYER THAT'S IT 
OUT THE FREEZER IN THE FRYER AND SORTED 
BUT GRAEME WANTS THE CUSTOMER TO DECIDE WHICH FISH IS BEST BY HOLDING A TASTE TEST 
GOT A MAMMOTH DINNER TO EAT HERE YOU HAVE I NEED YOUR HONEST OPINION ON THESE TWO FISHES 
THIS IS GORGEOUS THIS IS VERY NICE 
THIS IS THE FRESH 
THE FIRST FISH WAS MUCH TASTIER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE I'VE TASTED THE BATTER WAS LOVELY AND FRESH 
WHEREAS THIS ONE IS LIKE SOMETHING FROM A SUPERMARKET OUT OF A PACKET 
RIGHT HO MY OLD SON OH GOD 
AS M. D. WE'VE DONE THIS TASTE TEST 
OH YEAH AND I DO NOT WANT TO SEE THIS RUBBISH IN MY BAR 
ISN'T IT A BIT LATE OUTSIDE WE'VE DONE TWO TESTS 
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TALK WHILE YOU'RE WALKING 
THE FRESH FISH IS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT BETTER THAN THIS 
I THOUGH IT WAS FOR TESTING I DON'T WANT ANY MORE OF THIS RUBBISH 
CAN YOU MAKE SURE IN FUTURE WE BUY THE PROPER STUFF 
AND WE GET FRESH BATTER YOU SOUND REALLY WOUND UP MATE 
POSTIVE MARKETING WE'VE DONE THE TEST WE NEED TO MOVE ON 
THAT'S THE LAST WE'LL EVER SEE OF THAT RUBBISH 
THE PRESSURE IS CRACKING ME UP 
I CAN'T EVEN GET IN THE MAYONNAISE BOWL 
FREAKED OUT THERE A SEC 
THE TOURIST SEASON IS FINALLY OVER 
AND TWO MONTHS OF HARD TOIL HAS RESHAPED THE FYFES 
SUE'S LOST THREE STONE AND GRAEME TWO AND A HALF STONE 
HE'S THROWN AWAY HIS WALKING STICK AND HAS A NEW WAY OF COMMUTING 
I TRIED A PAIR OF TROUSERS ON LAST NIGHT AND I'M PROBABLY TWO SIZES LESS THAN I WAS 
I FEEL A LOT BETTER HEALTHWISE THAN I'VE PROBABLY DONE FOR TWENTY YEARS 
I WAS GOING TO RETIRE 
IT'S NOT TURNED OUT LIKE THAT 
I'LL WIPE THE SWEAT OFF YOUR BROW 
HOW YOU BEEN I'LL HAVE A SUPER BOCK PLEASE OH 
MORNING TO YOU NICE JOG WAS IT 
FOUR YEARS ON AND THE MONA LISA 
CONTINUES TO ATTRACT A LOYAL CROWD OF ALGARVE REGULARS 
BUSINESS IS GOOD 
SO GOOD THAT SIMON AND MANDIE AND THE GIRLS HAVE MOVED INTO A NEW VILLA 
IN THE HILLS OUTSIDE QUARTEIRA 
THE LIFE'S BETTER OUT HERE BECAUSE IT'S AN OUTDOOR LIFE OUT HERE 
OR YOU'LL BE OUT ALL THE TIME THE KIDS ARE ALWAYS OUTSIDE 
IT'S ONE HUNDRED PER CENT BETTER FOR THE GIRLS 
THEY CAN FINISH SCHOOL GO DOWN TO THE BEACH 
THE LIFE IS LOADS BETTER FOR US BECAUSE YOU'RE YOUR OWN BOSS 
YOU DECIDE WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO OPEN THE BAR AND GO TO WORK OR HAVE THE DAY OFF 
WE'VE GOT STAFF AND WE'VE GOT A HOUSE WHERE YOU CAN SIT 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ANYWHERE 
YOU CAN STAY HERE AND ENJOY THE SURROUNDINGS 
IT'S QUIET IT'S PEACEFUL 
IT'S JUST NICE ISN'T IT IT'S LOTS BETTER FOR THEM AND FOR US AND FOR US 
YOU'D NEVER BE ABLE TO HAVE A HOUSE LIKE T. HIS 
THIS HOUSE IS JUST UNDER A MILLION EUROS 
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT IN ENGLAND NO NO 
WHILE SIMON AND MANDIE CONTINUE TO ENJOY THEIR LIFE IN PORTUGAL 
SUE AND GRAEME ARE BACK IN THEIR NATIVE NOTTINGHAM 
I THINK AT THE MOMENT WE'RE STILL A LITTLE BIT UNSETTLED 
SUE CALLS IT BEING A NOMAD WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S ROUND THE CORNER 
WHEN YOU'VE GOT YOUR OWN PLACE AND A STEADY JOB AND A NICE LIFESTYLE 
YOU NEVER THINK DISASTERS ARE GOING TO BEFALL YOU 
WHAT WE'VE LEARNT IS THAT THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING NEW ROUND THE CORNER 
ALWAYS SOMETHING GONNA HIT YOU 
ALTHOUGH SUE AND GRAEME ARE BACK IN ENGLAND ALL THEIR SAVINGS ARE TIED UP IN THEIR BAR IN PORTUGAL 
UNLESS THEY CAN RECOVER THIS MONEY THEIR FUTURE REMAINS UNCERTAIN 
IF YOU HAD A CHEST OF DRAWERS IN THE CORNER YOU COULD PUT YOUR PANTS IN AND YOUR SOCKS 
AND PUT THE TELLY ON THE TOP 
SO THAT THE CAT'S NOT BALANCING ON THAT THING 
GET ONE OF THEM BRACKETS SCREW IT TO THE WALL 
SCREW WHAT TO THE WALL TELEVISION BRACKETS 
IT'S NOT OUR HOUSE YOU CAN'T SCREW ANYTHING TO THE WALLS 
WE'VE NOT GOT SO MUCH TO FALL BACK ON NOW 
WE'VE NOT GOT THE EQUITY IN THE HOUSE THAT WE HAD 
WE'VE STILL GOT THE BAR IF WE HAVE TO SELL IT 
PERHAPS IF SIMON AND THE FAMILY COME BACK 
AND THEY START AGAIN AND LET'S BEAR IN MIND THEY HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES BEING YOUNGER THAN US 
PERHAPS WE CAN ALL SETTLE HERE WHO KNOWS 
THAT'S NICE ISN'T IT 
IT'S A SHOE THING 
YOU'VE GOT SOME FUNNY IDEAS THEY'RE NICE 
YOU WOULDN'T GET MANY SHOES IN THERE WOULD YOU 
THE BITS AND PIECES WE'RE LOOKING FOR AT CAR BOOTS 
HAVE TO FIT IN WHEREVER WE CHOOSE TO LIVE WHICH 
IN THE LONG TERM WELL IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE IS ONLY RENTAL 
I DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT WELL I DO WHAT WILL BE WILL BE 
BUT YOU'RE NOT THE HOMEMAKER I AM NO 
SO I WANT SOMEWHERE THAT'S GONNA BE LONG TERM SO I CAN SIT BACK AND SAY 
ROOM BY ROOM DON'T LIKE THAT COLOUR ON THE WALL WANT TO CHANGE IT I DON'T LIKE THAT CARPET 
YOU CAN'T REALLY DO THAT WHEN YOU'RE IN A RENTED PLACE 
THIS IS TRADITIONAL SUNDAY DINNER 
ENGLISH STYLE 
I'M ALWAYS SWITCHING LIGHTS OFF GOING ROUND 
COS YOU NEVER KNOW 
YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO BE A BIT ECONOMICAL TILL WE FIND OUR FEET 
SO WE'RE TRYING TO CONSERVE AS MUCH MONEY AS WE CAN REALLY 
IT'S WHAT YOU MISS WHEN YOU'RE ABROAD ISN'T IT HMM 
AFTER THREE YEARS OF TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK GRAEME GAVE UP 
ON HIS LIFE IN PORTUGAL AND RETURNED ALONE TO THE U. K. 
HOMELESS AND UNEMPLOYED HE STAYED WITH HIS DAUGHTER SAM 
COME ON DOWN 
YOU DON'T MIND LUMPY GRAVY DO YOU 
NO IT'S ALL RIGHT 
I CAME BACK ALONE 
BECAUSE IT WAS THE BEST THING FOR BOTH OF US 
WE'D BEEN MARRIED THIRTY SEVEN YEARS 
WE WERE FIRST LOVES 
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME APART FROM HOSPITAL VISITS AND THE REST OF IT 
THAT WE'D BEEN PARTED I'M TORN BETWEEN THE TWO 
I'VE GOT SIMON SAYING IF YOU LEAVE YOU'LL NEVER SPEAK TO THE GRANDKIDS AGAIN 
I'VE GOT GRAEME SAYING IF YOU COME BACK IN SEPTEMBER WHICH WE'D PLANNED 
GRAEME LEFT IN MAY I WAS SEEING THE SEASON THROUGH TILL SEPTEMBER 
IF YOU STAY TILL SEPTEMBER THERE ISN'T A MARRIAGE LEFT 
COS WE CAN'T BE APART THAT LONG 
YOU GAVE YOUR WORD IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH 
I KNOW I DID THE LAST STRAW CAME WHEN 
I PHONED SAM'S AND YOU'D GONE OUT AND SHE SAID 
I'VE JUST HAD WORDS WITH DAD AND HE SAID HE'S GONNA 
I MEAN THIS IS WRONG FOR HER TO SAY TO ME HE'S GONNA THROW HIMSELF OFF THE MOTORWAY 
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY SAY THAT YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T BUT THAT'S WHAT SAM SAID 
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY SAY THAT AND EVEN ADAM 
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT I SAID 
BUT IT WAS THE CANAL BRIDGE BUT I DIDN'T SAY WHAT ALLEGEDLY I SAID 
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT BRIDGE IT WAS HOW DO YOU THINK I'M FEELING 
CAN'T SWIM THAT MAKES NO ODDS WHAT BRIDGE IT WAS 
YOU'RE THROWING YOURSELF OFF A CANAL BRIDGE 
SIMON AND AMANDA ARE LIKE COLLAPSING 
THINKING I'M GONNA LEAVE THEM IN THE LURCH ANY MINUTE NOW 
WHICH I WAS GOING TO DO BECAUSE OF THE ANTICS THAT YOU WERE PULLING 
AND I HATED WHAT I WAS DOING BUT WHAT WHAT MORE COULD I DO 
WHAT ELSE COULD I DO 
AND I JUST LEFT 
AND I COME BACK WITH THEM AND I GO TO MANCHESTER AIRPORT 
AND I JUST HEADED FOR THE DOORS AND THEN WHO COME BUSTING THROUGH THE BLOODY DOORS BUT HIM 
WITH HIS ASDA BLACK SUIT ON AND STUPID 
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE GREATEST LOVE STORY EVER TOLD THAT DAY WILL STAY WITH ME 
WE JUST JUST RAN AND SHOUTED AND FLING ME ARMS 
YOU DROPPED YOUR SUITCASE DIDN'T YOU 
AND WE JUST SORT OF 
WITH OUR ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER THE AIRPORT LIKE STOOD STILL 
IT WAS LIKE ONE OF THESE FILMS WHERE YOU SEE EVERYBODY AROUND YOU 
JUST LOOKING AT YOU FATAL ATTRACTION 
SUE AND GRAEME LEAVING PORTUGAL HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL ON THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH SIMON AND MANDIE 
FAMILY'S THERE TO SUPPORT YOU IN YOUR.WHEN YOU NEED THEM 
WHEN YOU'RE IN NEED OR WHEN THEY NEED YOU 
AND THE TIME THAT I NEEDED MY MUM AND DAD THEY GOT ON A PLANE AND OFF BACK TO ENGLAND 
WHICH IS WHY I'M I AM STILL BITTER 
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW I CAN EVER GET THAT OUT OF MY SYSTEM 
GRAEME HAD GONE OUT TO PORTUGAL FOR AN EASY LIFE TO WATCH HIS INVESTMENT GROW 
BUT THE HEAVY WORKLOAD AND MINIMAL STAFF AT THE BAR MEANT HE WAS SOON DRAFTED IN AS GENERAL DOGSBODY 
IT WAS AGREED AT THE VERY BEGINNING NOTHING DOWN ON WRITING 
WE HAD TO HAVE SOMEBODY IN CHARGE WHICH WAS GOING TO BE GRAEME AS THE MANAGING DIRECTOR 
WHICH NEVER WORKED 
THEN SIMON DECIDED TO HAVE A GO AT THE MANAGING DIRECTOR THAT CAUSED A LOT OF THE PROBLEM 
VERY HARD TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN HE'S MY DAD 
AND HE'S A BUSINESS PARTNER 
OR A WORKER OR THE BOSS OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT 
I'M BEING ME AND I'M A VERY I KNOW EVERYTHING VERY KNOW IT ALL PERSON 
MY DAD WOULD COME ALONG AND HE'D THINK HE KNOWS BEST COS HE'S OLDER 
SO THEREFORE IN THEORY ACCORDING TO HIM HE KNOWS EVERYTHING 
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW THE WAY THINGS ARE IN THAT SITUATION 
I'VE DONE BARS AND STUFF ALL MY LIFE HE'S NOT DONE IT 
NO FATHER LIKES TO BE TOLD BY HIS SON WHAT TO DO 
HE SAW ME AND SUE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT AS STAFF 
THE RELATIONSHIP GOT LIKE IT WASN'T FATHER SON IT WASN'T BUSINESS 
FOR THE TIME BEING SUE HAS FOUND HERSELF A JOB IN THE KITCHENS OF HER LOCAL GARDEN CENTRE 
BUT CAN'T QUITE LET GO OF HER LIFE IN PORTUGAL 
I WORK HERE AS IF IT WAS MINE LET'S PUT IT LIKE THAT 
I TRY AND GIVE THE SAME COMMITMENT TO IT AS I DID IN PORTUGAL 
BUT I STILL SIT HERE AND THINK I COULD BE AT MY BAR DOING THIS 
I COULD BE SAT WATCHING THE SEA ROLLING IN NOW 
WHAT WOULD I BE DOING NOW AT THE BAR 
BUT IT'S FRIGHTENINGLY SIMILAR 
IT'S A STRUGGLE PUTTING AN UMBRELLA UP 
SEE YOU'D BE DOING THIS IN PORTUGAL 
PUTTING YOUR BROLLIES UP START THE DAY 
RED HOT 
AND HERE WE ARE IN ENGLAND 
FREEZING COLD CHANCE OF RAIN 
SAME JOB THOUGH 
I REALLY ENJOYED AS DAFT AS IT MAY SEEM 
STANDING IN A SWEATY KITCHEN WORKING 
I REALLY LOVED IT YOU KNOW 
IN FACT SOME WEEKS OR SOME DAYS WE HAVE TO BAN THE WORD P. MEANING PORTUGAL 
WE HAVE TO BAN THAT IN CONVERSATION BECAUSE OTHERWISE I'LL JUST GO ON AND ON AND ON 
GRAEME ON THE OTHER HAND IS NOT MISSING PORTUGAL ONE LITTLE BIT 
I'M DOING THE JOB NOW I'VE ALWAYS DONE 
I'VE DONE THE SAME SORT OF JOB SINCE I WAS ERM SINCE I LEFT COLLEGE AT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN 
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A QUANTITY SURVEYOR I'M TRAINED TO DO IT 
AT THE BAR I FELT A BIT UNEASY HERE 
YOU'RE CONFIDENT IN YOUR ABILITY YOU'RE USED TO DOING THE SAME THING 
I THINK AS YOU GET OLDER YOU ARE MORE OF A NINE TO FIVE HUMDRUM TYPE OF PERSON 
YOU LIKE ROUTINE YOU LIKE YOUR REGULAR NIGHTS OUT WITH THE BOYS 
YOU LIKE YOUR REGULAR SITTING DOWN WATCHING THE TELEVISION PROGRAMMES 
YOU LIKE TO HAVE YOUR TEA AT THE SAME TIME EVERY DAY 
WITH THEIR LIFE SAVINGS TIED UP IN A BUSINESS 
THAT GIVES THEM NO FINANCIAL RETURN AND WITH RETIREMENT LOOMING 
SUE AND GRAEME YEARN FOR A MORE SECURE AND COMFORTABLE EXISTENCE 
YOU KNOW IT SOUNDS DAFT TO SAY TIME IS RUNNING OUT BUT YOU KNOW 
WE'RE GETTING TO THE WRONG SIDE OF SIXTY SOON AND ERM 
YOU KNOW YOU WANT A BIT OF QUALITY OF LIFE DON'T YOU 
HAVING MADE NINETY PER CENT OF THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT INTO THE MONA LISA 
SUE AND GRAEME NEED TO SEE SOME RETURN ON THEIR MONEY BEFORE THEY RETIRE 
FROM A MENTAL POINT OF VIEW IT WOULD BE BETTER 
IF THE BAR WAS NOW PUT TO SLEEP FROM GRAEME AND I.'S POINT OF VIEW 
THAT MIGHT BE UNFAIR ON SIMON AND AMANDA BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL OUT THERE WORKING AT IT 
BUT IF THEY'RE FINDING IT DIFFICULT 
IF THEY'RE FINDING IT STRESSFUL BECAUSE WE'RE NOT OUT THERE HELPING 
AND WHAT LITTLE BIT OF MONEY THEY ARE MAKING 
IS GOING ON PAYING SOMEBODY ELSE TO WORK THERE 
THEN YOUR OTHER OPTION IS TO TRY AND SELL IT 
I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY IF THEY SOLD IT AND WE ALL TOOK OUR MONEY AND RAN 
THE OTHER HALF OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS HAS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PLANS FOR THE BAR'S FUTURE 
TO BE HONEST I AM BUGGERED IF I'M HAVE JUST WASTED FOUR YEARS OF MY LIFE 
IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY TO JUST SELL IT 
HAVING DECIDED THAT THE ONLY WAY TO MOVE ON IS SELLING THE MONA LISA 
SUE PERSUADES GRAEME THEY MUST RETURN AND FACE SIMON AND MANDIE 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SUE AND GRAEME HAVE BEEN BACK TO PORTUGAL TOGETHER SINCE THEY LEFT 
A YEAR AND A HALF AGO 
O. K. THERE THEY ARE THERE THEY ARE THERE THEY ARE 
GRANDMA 
GRANDPA 
YOU ALL RIGHT M. M. M. 
SIMON AND MANDIE ARE KEEN TO SHOW SUE AND GRAEME WHAT THEY'RE MISSING 
DO YOU WANT THESE ONES OR DO YOU WANT THE PORTUGUESE SAUSAGE 
YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY 
YOU WERE HUGE WHEN WE CAME OVER AS BIG AS I AM NOW BIGGER BIGGER 
LIKE JABBA THE HUTT SAT ON THE SETTEE 
I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER I'D REACHED BACK TO THE SIXTEEN STONE NO NO NOT AT ALL 
NO THEN YOU CAME OVER AND YOU HAD LIKE SKIN HANGING DOWN FROM THE ARMS 
YEAH THAT'S ALL FILLED OUT NOW IT'S ALL THE PIE AND CHIPS FROM THE CHIP SHOP ONCE A WEEK 
THERE WAS ONE POINT WHERE I COULDN'T WEAR THE SWIMSUIT COS I'D LOST SO MUCH WEIGHT 
THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT WHEN I GOT IN IT REMEMBER 
IF YOU EVER WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT COME AND MOVE TO PORTUGAL 
YOU CAN'T GO TO THE SHOP AND GET ALL THESE NICE THINGS LIKE WE'VE GOT HERE 
O. I. FLIES 
BEFORE BROACHING THE SALE OF THE BAR WITH SIMON 
SUE AND GRAEME GET REACQUAINTED WITH LIFE IN PORTUGAL 
FIRST STOP AN OLD DRINKING HAUNT 
WE USED TO COME HERE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING ON THE WAY TO WORK 
WE USED TO LIVE DOWN THE ROAD AND WE USED TO WALK UP HERE 
HAVE A DRINK COFFEE AND A BRANDY BEFORE WE OPENED THE BAR UP 
WE CAME HERE MOST MORNINGS SOMETIMES WE HAD ONE COFFEE AND BRANDY 
SOMETIMES TWO COFFEES AND BRANDIES 
ON THE GOOD OCCASION WE HAD THREE BRANDIES YEP WE DID 
IT'S BEEN NICE NOTHING'S CHANGED STILL THE SAME 
STILL THE SAME SAME PEOPLE HERE 
YEAH THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT THIS IS WHAT YOU DREAM ABOUT REALLY 
WE'D SPEND THREE DAYS HERE IF WE COULD WOULDN'T WE 
STRAIGHT FROM THE AIRPORT SIT HERE THEN BACK TO THE AIRPORT THAT'LL DO US 
M. M. M. IT WOULDN'T TAKE LONG IF YOU DID MOVE BACK HERE 
IT WOULDN'T TAKE LONG TO SLIP BACK INTO THIS SORT OF LIFE WOULD IT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT TO DO NO 
LOOK AT THAT ONE LOOK AT THAT ONE 
BET YOU DON'T GO ON THE BEACH WITH MUMMY AND DADDY DO YOU 
INDY REMEMBER WHEN WE USED TO DRAW PICTURES OF GRANDMA WITH A CIGARETTE IN HER MOUTH 
YOU REMEMBER I CAN DO THAT 
I CAN DO THE PICTURE OF GRANDMA SMOKING A CIGARETTE 
MARKET DAY IN QUARTEIRA AND BRITISH TOURISTS 
FROM THE SURROUNDING RESORTS FLOCK TO THE TOWN 
IT'LL BE A BUSY DAY AT THE MONA LISA 
SUE IS KEEN TO HELP OUT AT HER BAR BUT IT'S AN EMOTIONAL RETURN 
COS YOU'RE SEEING WHAT WAS THE BEST PART OF THREE AND A HALF YEARS OF YOUR LIFE 
YOU ALL RIGHT MORNING YEAH 
I LIKE THE CHAIRS BRIGHT NICE AND BRIGHT 
I SEE THE ENGLISH FLAG'S STILL FLYING THEN CERTAINLY IS 
MY FAIRY LIGHTS ARE STILL UP FROM THE CHRISTMAS BEFORE I LEFT 
THERE'S PROBABLY ABOUT TWO FOUR SIX EIGHT OF THEM TWINKLING NOW 
THERE SHOULD BE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWINKLING UM 
SEE IT NOW SAYS SIMON MANDIE AND THE GIRLS WELCOME YOU IT USED TO SAY 
GRAEME SUE SIMON MANDIE AND THE GIRLS WELCOME YOU 
SO WE'RE OBVIOUSLY STRUCK OFF THE THING NOW 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD DO WITH A LICK OF PAINT ACROSS THE FRONT 
I MEAN I REMEMBER PAINTING THAT WHEN WE STARTED FOUR YEARS AGO 
BUT SOME THINGS HAVEN'T CHANGED 
CLASSIC HAMBURGER CHEESEBURGER SAUSAGE BURGER 
CHICKEN BURGER BACON BURGER BACON AND CHEESE BURGER 
VEGGIE BURGER LARGE HOT DOG 
ALL YOUR USUAL THAT YOU'D GET IN ENGLAND 
AND THEY ALL TASTE LIKE ENGLISH FOOD AS WELL 
THEY'VE GOT SOME NEW APRONS 
THEY'RE BIG TOO THEY MUST HAVE REALISED I'D PUT ALL MY WEIGHT BACK ON 
TABLE SIX 
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN THE WAY 
SUE DECIDES TO SEE IF SHE STILL HAS THE MAGIC TOUCH FOR COOKING THE MONA LISA'S FULL MONTY BREAKFAST 
IF YOU WERE A PIANIST THIS IS YOUR GRAND PIANO 
YOU WATCH THIS 
I HAVEN'T DONE A FULL MONTY FOR A YEAR AND FOUR MONTHS 
SO YOU JUST FORGET WHAT WAS ON IT FOR A MINUTE 
FOUR SAUSAGES FOUR BACON FOUR TOMATO BEANS ARE IN POCKET OF MUSHROOMS NOW 
OH YES IT'S JUST LIKE I NEVER LEFT 
THIS IS WHERE I'M NOT QUITE USED TO 
NEED ANOTHER EGG THOUGHT WE ONLY DID ONE EGG 
NO TWO OH SHIT 
SEE THINGS CHANGE WHEN YOU'RE NOT HERE YOU KNOW SUE 
THIS IS THE STRESS BENCH 
WHEN IT GOT TOO MUCH IN THE KITCHEN PERHAPS SIMON OR GRAEME 
WOULD JUST SAY SOMETHING TO TIP US OVER THE EDGE 
AND THAT'S IT TIME OUT I'M OFF AND WOULD RUN DOWN TO HERE 
AND SIT ON HERE AND HAVE A CIGARETTE 
I THINK WHILE WE'VE STILL GOT THE BAR YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO FEEL 
THAT YOU'VE STILL GOT A BAR BACK IN PORTUGAL 
AND YOU'RE ALWAYS STILL GOING TO THINK 
I WISH SOMETIMES I'D BE WORKING THERE I WISH IT HAD WORKED OUT 
AT THE MOMENT IT'S UNFINISHED BUSINESS ISN'T IT REALLY COS IT'S STILL GOING AND WE STILL OWN IT 
THE DAY HAS FINALLY COME FOR SUE AND GRAEME 
TO BROACH THE DELICATE SUBJECT OF THEIR MONEY 
WELL I WANT YOU TO SELL IT COURSE YOU DO ME AND DAD WILL BE DEAD SOON 
SO YOU DON'T NEED THE MONEY ONLY WANT A COUPLE OF GRAND 
WHO'S GOING TO BE DEAD SOON 
WE ARE YOU'RE SIXTY NEXT YEAR WE AIN'T GONNA BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO RENT ANYWHERE 
IF WE DIDN'T WORK WE COULDN'T AFFORD AN OUSE 
I'M NOT STAYING HERE WORKING ME ARSE OFF AT THE BAR TO GIVE YOU SOME MONEY 
RIGHT BECAUSE THE SAME DEAL IS THERE THAT WAS ORIGINALLY THERE 
YOU COME BACK YOU WORK AT THE BAR TILL WE SELL 
YOU'D STILL WANT A RETURN ON YOUR MONEY WOULDN'T YOU 
IT'S NOT AS EASY AS THAT IT IS AS EASY IN MY EYES IT'S AS BLACK AND WHITE AS THAT 
YOUR MONEY'S STUCK THERE UNTIL IT IS SOLD YEAH 
OR YOU GET A DIVIDEND FROM WHATEVER ELSE WE END UP DOING 
RIGHT THERE'S NO WAY I COULD WORK AT THAT BAR AND SELL IT 
I CAN'T SEE REALISTICALLY THE MONEY COMING BACK OUT OF IT 
IN ANY HUMUNGOUS AMOUNT FOR PROBABLY TWO THREE YEARS 
SO ARE WE SAYING THEN THAT YOU WANT A COUPLE OF YEARS 
AND WITHIN A COUPLE OF YEARS WE'LL BE GETTING SOME RETURN OUT OF IT 
IF DURING THAT COUPLE OF YEARS YOU WANT TO INJECT SOME MORE CASH INTO IT NO WE CAN'T DO SIMON 
WHERE AM I GOING TO GET SOME CASH 
WE CAN'T DO YOU'RE JUST POURING MONEY DOWN THE MONEY PIT 
WE NEED THAT MONEY TO KEEP THE ROOF OVER OUR HEAD 
DAD CAN'T TAKE A MONTH OFF WORK WELL HE COULD BUT WHAT'S HE GONNA DO IN THAT MONTH WHEN HE COMES OVER 
SAY I PACK UP WORK TOMORROW YEAH I CAN SEE WHEN YOU RETIRE 
YOU CAN COME OUT HERE AND THEN YOU GET YOUR MONEY 
THAT'S IT YOU GET ABOUT FORTY QUID A WEEK 
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD ANYWHERE TO LIVE EXACTLY I THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT A PLAN 
WE NEED TO DISCUSS IT AS TO WHERE WE MOVE FROM NOW 
YOU SEE I STILL AND I KNOW

THAT'S MY WHOLE POINT I WENT BACK FOR ME 
GO ON MAND YOU'RE NOT SAYING ANYTHING 
THAT'S SELFISH YOU WENT BACK FOR YOU HE ADMITS IT 
GRAEME YOU ARE VERY SELFISH 
AND I DIDN'T REALISE THAT TO THE EXTENT 
BUT I STILL LOVE YOU TO BITS AND THAT'S WHY I CAME BACK FOR YOU RIGHT 
BUT NOW IT SEEMS YOU CAME BACK FOR YOURSELF 
WHAT ABOUT ME WHERE DO I FIGURE AM I GOING TO BE DEAD BEFORE YOU THEN 
ALL YOU WANT IS SOMEBODY TO COOK CLEAN WIPE YOUR ARSE AND WASH YOUR SHIRTS 
BUT WE DIDN'T I GAVE UP A LOT HERE TO COME BACK TO YOU A LOT 
NO NOT JUST THAT SUE YOU BOTH GAVE A LOT UP EVERYBODY DID 
WITH SIMON AND MANDIE SHOWING NO SIGNS OF BUDGING 
OVER THE SALE OF THE MONA LISA SUE AND GRAEME REMAIN IN LIMBO 
WITH RETIREMENT AROUND THE CORNER AND NO HOUSE OF THEIR OWN IN THE U. K. 
GRAEME FINDS HE IS UNDER PRESSURE TO RETURN TO PORTUGAL 
HE AGREES TO GIVE WORKING AT THE BAR ANOTHER GO 
DO YOU WANT ICE IN THE ORANGE NO THANKS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THEY THINK THEY KNOW EVERYTHING THESE KIDS DON'T THEY 
YOU TEACH THEM ALL THEY KNOW THEY KNOW MORE THAN YOU 
HE USED TO WORK HERE BUT HE DECIDED ENGLAND WAS A BETTER PLACE TO BE 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT NOT TO INTERFERE 
I'VE MADE MY MIND UP NOT TO INTERFERE 
BECAUSE THEY RUN IT DIFFERENT WAYS DON'T THEY 
LOTS OF THINGS I COULD COMMENT ON 
I'M HAVING CHICKEN BREAST AND ENGLISH BACON AND BAGUETTE PLEASE 
I DON'T SEE IT AS OUR BAR AT THE MINUTE 
WE'RE JUST ON HOLIDAY 
OH NO I SEE IT AS OUR BAR I KNOW YOU DO BUT I DON'T 
YEAH BUT THE THING IS GRAEME WHAT MADDENS ME AND WHAT ANNOYS ME 
WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE AN ARGUMENT ARE WE NO BUT YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT IT THAT YOU'VE STILL GOT A BAR 
OVER HERE YOU'VE PUT ALL YOUR MONEY INTO YEAH 
I THINK PART OF ME THINKS IT COULD BE QUITE HARD FOR THEM TO COME BACK FROM OUR SIDE OF IT 
BECAUSE WE'VE HAD THE FULL RANGE OF THE BAR FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS MAKING OUR OWN DECISIONS AND WHATEVER WE SAY GOES 
THANK YOU MANDIE 
BUT WILL SIMON AND AMANDA WANT US TO COME BACK 
WE'VE NOT CONTRIBUTED ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT 
WE LOOKED AFTER THEM WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS 
THEY DON'T LOOK AT THAT SORT OF THING SIMON MIGHT NOT WANT YOU COMING BACK 
THEY WOULD SNAP YOUR HAND OFF 
WE'D HAVE TO FIND THEM SOMEWHERE TO LIVE THEY COULDN'T LIVE WITH US REALLY 
NO THEY COULD THEY COULDN'T YES THEY COULD NO THEY COULDN'T 
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A CHOICE ONCE I RETIRE 
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO HAVE A HOUSE TO LIVE IN 
SO YOU COME HERE 
WITH SIMON AND MANDIE REFUSING TO SELL UP 
GRAEME'S LIFE SAVINGS REMAIN FROZEN IN THE MONA LISA 
HE'S LEFT WITH NO CHOICE BUT TO FACE THE PROSPECT OF A SECOND PORTUGUESE RETIREMENT 
IF WE COME BACK WE CAN HAVE THE BEDROOM WITH THE EN SUITE 
HAVE WHATEVER BEDROOM YOU WANT I LOVE THAT ONE 
FIFTY EUROS A WEEK PER PERSON 
SORRY I NEED TO WRITE A LIST OUT 
SO ARE YOU SAYING YOU'RE COMING BACK THEN 
SO ARE YOU COMING BACK THEN 
BRING YOUR OWN SATELLITE DISH 
SIMON WE'VE GOT NOTHING WE'VE GOT FREEVIEW THAT'S ALL WE'VE GOT 
SO OUT OF ONE HUNDRED HOW MUCH IS YOUR RENT THEN
