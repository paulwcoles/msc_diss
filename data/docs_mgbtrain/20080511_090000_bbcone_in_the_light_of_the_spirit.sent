THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK 
AND THE DOORS OF THE HOUSE WHERE 
THE DISCIPLES HAD MET WERE LOCKED 
FOR FEAR OF THE JEWS 
JESUS CAME AND STOOD AMONG THEM AND 
SAID PEACE BE WITH YOU 
AFTER HE SAID THIS HE SHOWED THEM 
HIS HANDS AND HIS SIDE 
THEN THE DISCIPLES REJOICED WHEN 
THEY SAW THE LORD

AS THE FATHER HAS SENT ME SO I 
SEND YOU 
WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS HE BREATHED 
ON THEM 
AND SAID TO THEM RECEIVE THE HOLY

IT'S A SUNDAY MORNING A MOTHER 
HURIS INTO HER SON'S BED REMAIN AND 
SPEAKS AGITATEDLY AT THE SLEEPING 
BUNDLE BUNDLE LOOK IT'S SUNDAY TIME TO GET 
UP AND GO TO CHURCH THE SON 
MUMBLES FROM UNDER THE COVERS I 
DON'T WANT TO GO WHAT DO YOU 
MEAN YOU DON'T WANT TO GO THAT IS 
SILLY NOW GET UP GET DRESSED AND 
GO TO CHURCH HE SAYS NO I 
DON'T WANT TO GO I DON'T LIKE THEM 
THEY DON'T LIKE ME THE MOTHER 
REPLYS NOW THAT IS PLAIN NONSENSE 
YOU HAVE TO GO TO CHURCH I'LL GIVE 
YOU TWO REASONS WHY YOU MUST ONE 
YOU ARE FORTY EIGHT YEARS OLD TWO YOU'RE THE 
VICAR OUR FIRST SURPRISE AND 
THEN LAUGHTER THAT'S AT THE HEART 
OF TODAY'S CELEBRATION THE GOSPEL 
TELLS US THAT THE DISCIPLES OF 
JEERS WERE SEEFS WERE HIDING 
SHIEDING HIDING IN FEAR BEHIND 
CLOSED AND LOCKED DOORS SHUTTING 
OUT THE WORLD THE HOSTILE 
PERSECUTING AND TERRIFYING WORLD 
THEN A SURPRISE INTO THEIR 
ISOLATION JESUS COMES THROUGH 
CLOSED DOORS HE WALKS PAST LOCKS 
HE BREAKS IN SURPRISE FIRST 
SURELY BUT JUST AS SURELY THERE 
MUST HAVE BEEN LAUGHTER 
BUT FIRST NERVOUS AND HESITATING 
BUT AFTER LONG AND LOUD AS THE 
IMPACT OF THEIR FRIEND'S PRESENCE 
SARNING IN 
I'M NOT SURE THEY WOULD HAVE 
LAUGHED SO LONG AND HARD HAD THEY 
KNOWN WHAT THEIR FRIEND WOULD ASK 
OF THEM BUT FOR THE MOMENT THEY 
REJOICED REJOICED WHAT HE WOULD ASK IS WHAT THE 
MOTHER IN OUR STORY ASKED GET OUT 
OF BED GET OUT OF YOUR ISOLATION 
YOUR FEAR GO TO CHURCH TO THE 
ASSEMBLY TO THE WORLD AND ANNOUNCE 
THE GOOD NEWS 
THEY TOO ARE CORRECT TO PROTEST 
WE DON'T LIKE THEM THEY DON'T 
LIKE US THAT'S WHY THEY WERE 
HIDING BUT THE ANSWER THEY GET IS 
THIS YOU ARE ZERO OR FORTY YEARS OLD 
YOU ARE THE BEARERS OF THE GOSPEL 
YOU HAVE TO GO YOU HAVE 
MISSION BUT SINCE THEIR SCARED 
AND UNSURE JESUS PROMISES THEM 
ANOTHER SURPRISE THE SPIRIT HE 
SAYS COMES AT PENTECOST AND ENABLES 
THEM TO DO WHAT THEY CANNOT DO OF 
THEMSELVES WHEN THAT PROMISE IS 
FULFILLED THE DISCIPLES OF 
DISCIPLES OF JESUS SURPRISE OTHERS 
THEY RUN FROM THEIR ISOLATION 
BREAK OPEN THE LOOKS LOCKS AND 
THE DOORS AND IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE 
THE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN HIDING AND 
IN FEAR SPEAK OPENLY AND INING TOS 
SO THAT SOME OF THE CROWD LAUGH AS 
THEY THINK THEY ARE DRUNK THE 
DISCIPLES DON'T CARE THEY ARE 
LAUGHING TOO AND BUSY BEING 
SURPRISED 
THAT ZERO ARE BAPTISED THAT VERY DAY 
AS EACH PAGE OF THE ACT OF THE 
APOSTLES TURNS THE SPIRIT 
CONTINUES TO CAUSE SURPRISES OF 
CURES COURAGE MARTYRDOM AND THE 
REMARKABLE SPREAD OF THE GOOD NEWS 
ARE WE READY TO BE SURPRISED TODAY 
DO WE EXPECT TO BE CHALLENGED BY 
THE WILD LAUGHTER OF GOD'S SPIRIT 
OR HAVE OUR CHRISTIAN LIVES BECOME 
TOO PREDICTABLE TOO DOMESTICATED 
PERHAPS EVEN DULL THE EARLY CELTIC 
CHRISTIANS THE BEHAVE MEN AND 
WOMEN THAT KEPT THE FAITH ALIVE 
HERE IN CORNWALL WHEN SO MUCH OF 
BRITAIN HAD FOREGOTEN THE CHRISTIAN 
STORY THEY HAD A VERY POWERFUL 
IMAGE FOR THE HOLY SPOIRT NOT FOR 
THEM THE GENTLE DOVE THE PEACEFUL 
SIGN OF GOD'S PRESENCE FOR THEM 
GOD'S SPIRIT WAS MORE LIKE WILD GOOSE GOOSE IT'S A VERY SUGGESTIVE AND EXCITING 
IMAGE GEESE ARE DIFFICULT BIRDS TO 
CONTROL THEY MAKE A LOT OF NOISE 
AND THEY HAVE A HABIT OF PECKING 
THOSE WHO TRY TO CONTAIN THEM 
GEESE FLY FAST ER INA FLOCK THAN ON 
THEIR OWN AND THEY MAKE EXCELLENT 
GUARD DOGS 
SUCH IS THE SPIRIT OF PENTECOST 
LIKE THE WILD GOOSE THIS SPIRIT 
COMES IN NOT QUIET COMFORTITY BUT 
DEMANDING TO BE HEARD AND HIS 
HONKING SONG IS NOT SWEET TO MANY 
THE SPIRIT DRIVES PEOPLE TOGETHER 
DEMANDING THEY SUPPORT AND TRAVEL 
WITH ONE ANOTHER THIS SPIRIT 
FORCES THOSE ON WHO HE RESTS TO 
BECOME NOISEY PASSIONATE AND 
COURAGEOUS GUARDIANS OF THE GOSPEL 
THIS UNCONTROLLABLE UNCOMFORTABLE 
SPIRIT IS READY TO FLY IN OUR LIVES 
AND OUR CHURCHES TODAY 
ARE WE READY THIS CHRISTIAN AID

INTRUSION TO CONFRONT US WITH THE 
SORROWS OF OUR WORLD TO SEE IN THE 
HOMELESS ORPHAN OF BURMA OUR

THE NOISEY GOOSE OF PENTECOST TO 
MAKE US SPEAK OUT FOR THE POOR AND
