BORIS JOHNSON ANSWERS THE QUESTIONS 
YOU POSTED ON THE NET IN OUR ONLINE 
POLITICAL DEBATE 
WELCOME TO THE B. B. C. NEWS AT SIX 
IT'S BEEN CALLED A CLIMB DOWN 
CONCESSION A U. TURN FACED WITH 
THE MOST SERIOUS BACKBENCH 
CHALLENGE OF HIS PREMIERSHIP 
GORDON BROWN HAS CHANGED HIS MIND 
IN THE ROW OVER THE ABOLITION OF 
THE TEN PENCE TAX BAND IN FIERY 
EXCHANGES IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER CALLED THE 
PRIME MINISTER A LOSER NOT A LEADER 
OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CAROLE 
WALKER REPORTS 
NO REPRIEVE FOR THE TEN P. TAX RATE 
BUT A COMPENSATION PACKAGE FOR 
THOSE WHO HAVE LOST OUT THAT ADDS 
UP TO A CLIMB DOWN IN THE COMMONS 
THE PRIME MINISTER ANNOUNCES HELP 
FOR SOME PENSIONERS AND YOUNG 
WORKERS WORKERS THAT IS WHY ALSO ON THE WORKING TAX 
CREDIT WHERE THERE ARE ISSUES ABOUT 
YOUNG PEOPLE AND ISSUES ABOUT PART 
TIME WORKERS WE WILL ALSO BRING 
FORWARD PROPOSALS SOON IN TIME FOR 
THE PRE BUDGET REPORT 
MR. SPEAKER WE ARE DETERMINED TO 
TAKE ACTION BECAUSE WE ARE THE 
PARTY OF FAIRNESS TACKLING POVERTY 
ONLY FOUR DAYS AGO THE CHANCELLOR 
WAS STICKING TO HIS GUNS 
WHAT I 
CAN'T DO IS REWRITE THE BUDGET THE 
FINANCIAL YEAR HAS ALREADY BEGUN 
IT WAS GORDON BROWN'S LAST BUDGET 
AS CHANCELLOR THAT SCRAPPED THE TEN 
PENCE RATE BY THE TIME IT TOOK 
EFFECT HIS M. P.'S WERE WARNING HIM IT 
WAS A MISTAKE THE ROW OVERSHADOWED 
LAST WEEK'S VISIT TO THE UNITED 
STATES BY MONDAY HE WAS TELLING 
M. P.'S HE UNDERSTOOD THEIR CONCERNS 
TODAY'S ABOUT FACE WAS GIFT FOR 
HIS OPPONENTS AT QUESTION TIME WE WE WERE TOLD THERE WOULD BE NO 
BACKDOWN WE'VE HAD A BACKDOWN WE 
WERE TOLD HE COULDN'T REWRITE THE 
BUDGET HE'S REWRITING THE BUDGET 
WE WERE TOLD THERE WOULD BE NO 
CONCESSIONS THERE ARE NOW MASSIVE 
CONCESSIONS WILL HE TELL US IS HE 
MAKING THESE CHANGES BECAUSE HE 
THOUGHT HE WOULD LOSE THE VOTE NEXT 
WEEK 
HE SAID GORDON BROWN WAS A WEEK PATHETIC FIGURE 
ISN'T IT THE CASE 
MR. SPEAKER THAT THE LABOUR PARTY 
HAVE FINALLY WORKED OUT THAT 
THEY'VE GOT A LOSER NOT A LEADER 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WEIGHED IN 
TOO 
PENALISING 
THE POOR TO REWARD TOO THE RICH WAS THE JOB OF THE 
CONSERVATIVE PARTY SO HAS THE 
PRIME MINISTER DELIBERATELY MAKES 
THE LOWEST EARNERS OVER FIVE 
MILLION OF THEM EVEN WORSE OFF IN 
THIS COUNTRY CAN HE EXPLAIN TO ME 
WHY HE IS DOING THE TORIES' JOB FOR 
THEM IF HE CAN'T DELIVER ON 
POVERTY WHAT ON EARTH IS THE POINT 
OF THIS INCREASINGLY POINTLESS 
PRIME MINISTER 
WHO WILL THE GOVERNMENT HELP 
PENSIONERS UNDER SIXTY FIVE AND SOME 
YOUNGER WORKERS WITHOUT CHILDREN 
THE MAN WHO LED THE REBELLION IS 
SATISFIED SATISFIED I'M IMMENSELY PLEASED WITH THE 
ACTION THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN ABOVE 
ALL IT'S GOING TO BRING PROPER 
COMPENSATION TO THOSE WHO WOULD 
OTHERWISE LOSE OUT 
SO IT HAS BEEN 
HUMILIATING FOR THE PRIME MINISTER 
BUT THE DAMAGE IS FAR LESS THAN THE 
PROSPECT OF A DEFEAT HERE IN THE 
COMMONS NEXT WEEK THAT COULD HAVE 
TRIGGERED A LEADERSHIP CRISIS JUST 
BEFORE POLLING DAY FOR THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS GORDON BROWN SAYS HE HAS 
LISTENED TO PEOPLE'S CONCERNS ABOUT 
THE TEN P. RATE BUT SOME M. P.'S SAY HE 
SHOULD HAVE DONE SO SOONER AND 
AVOIDED TODAY'S EMBARRASSING U. TURN 
THE ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. TAX BAND 
WAS A KEY PART OF GORDON BROWN'S 
LAST BUDGET AS CHANCELLOR OF THE 
EXCHEQUER NOW HIS SUCCESSOR 
ALISTAIR DARLING HAS THE JOB OF 
DEALING WITH THE FALLOUT IN A 
MOMENT WE WILL HEAR FROM OUR 
POLITICAL EDITOR NICK ROBINSON 
WHO HAS BEEN TALKING TO THE PRIME 
MINISTER FIRST HUGH PYM HAS BEEN 
LOOKING AT WHO WILL BENEFIT THE THE TEN P. TAX ABOLITION AND THE 
SUBSEQUENT U. TURN AFFECT A LOT OF 
PEOPLE IT'S ESTIMATED THAT FIFTY THREE 
MILLION FAMILIES LOST OUT FROM LAST 
YEAR'S BUDGET CHANGES WHICH TOOK 
EFFECT THIS MONTH THE LOSERS ARE 
PEOPLE WHO EARN LESS THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND A 
YEAR AND DON'T GET ANY HELP FROM 
THE TAX CREDIT SYSTEM WHO 
PRECISELY ARE THEY 
FIRST OF ALL PEOPLE UNDER TWENTY FIVE 
WITHOUT CHILDREN THE CHANCELLOR OF 
THE EXCHEQUER SAYS HE CAN HELP THEM 
WITH WORKING TAX CREDITS WHICH THEY 
DON'T CURRENTLY GET OR BY BOOSTING 
THE MINIMUM WAGE THEN THERE ARE 
PEOPLE AGED SIXTY TO SIXTY FOUR SOME OF WHOM 
HAVE TAKEN EARLY RETIREMENT THEY 
DON'T QUALIFY FOR AGE RELATED TAX 
ALLOWANCES ALISTAIR DARLING SAYS 
HE COULD USE WINTER FUEL ALLOWANCE 
TO HELP EXPERTS SAY IT WON'T BE 
EASY TO TARGET EFFECTIVELY THESE 
SPECIFIC GROUPS 
IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THE CHANCELLOR 
OF THE EXCHEQUER HAS THE MONEY 
AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO SPEND 
ENOUGH TO CLEAR OUT ALL OF THE 
LOSERS FROM THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN BUDGET PART 
OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU END UP 
IN MANY CASES HAVING TO SPEND MONEY 
ON PEOPLE THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO 
PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY GAINING IN 
ORDER TO GET THE MONEY TO THE 
LOSERS 
WHAT'S MORE THERE ARE LOSERS LOSERS WHO WON'T BE COVERED BY THE 
MEASURES ANNOUNCED TODAY PEOPLE 
UNDER SIXTY WHO HAVE TAKEN EARLY 
RETIREMENT AND THOSE PART TIME 
WORKERS WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR TAX 
CREDITS THEY MAY WELL VOICE THEIR 
DISPLEASURE TO M. P.'S 
HERE'S THE BIG CHALLENGE FOR THE 
CHANCELLOR IF THE MEASURES DON'T 
COST MUCH THEY WON'T HAVE MUCH 
IMPACT IF WILL IS A HEFTY PRICE 
TAG HE WILL HAVE TO FIND THE MONEY 
FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE MAYBE CREATING 
MORE LOSERS 
SHORTLY AFTER THOSE NOISY SCENES IN 
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS GORDON BROWN 
SPOKE TO OUR POLITICAL EDITOR NICK 
ROBINSON LET'S FIND OUT WHO HE 
EXPLAINED TODAY'S CHANGE OF POLICY 
NICK NICK WESTMINSTER HAS ECHOED TO THE SOUND 
OF SCREECHING POLITICAL TYRES TODAY 
GEORGE THE PRIME MINISTER FELT IT 
NECESSARY TO CALL IN POLITICAL 
EDITORS TO EXPLAIN WHAT ON EARTH 
WAS GOING ON I'VE BEEN LISTENING 
HE SAID I HAVE NOT BEEN PUSHED 
AROUND THAT WHEN I PUSHED HIM 
AGAIN AND AGAIN ABOUT WHY HE WAS 
NOW ANNOUNCING SOMETHING THAT IN 
INTERVIEW AFTER INTERVIEW MEETING 
AFTER MEETING HE HAD SIMPLY 
REFUSED TO DO BEFORE 
WHEN YOU ASKED ME NICK ALL OF THE 
TIME WOULD WE CHANGE THE TEN P. 
RATE I HAVE ALWAYS SAID NO IT 
WAS RIGHT TO ABOLISH THE TEN P. RATE 
THE FEATURE OF THIS BUDGET IN THE 
FINANCIAL BILL NEXT WEEK IS TO HAVE 
A BASIC RATE OF TAX OF TWENTY PENCE IN 
THE POUND IS THE CENTRAL FEATURE 
OF THE BUDGET 
YOU SAY THE 
FUNDAMENTALS HAVE NOT CHANGED THE THE FUNDAMENTALS HAVE NOT CHANGED TWENTY TWO P. 
TO TWENTY P. WE WANT TO USE THE TAX 
CREDIT SYSTEM TO TAKE MORE PEOPLE 
OUT OF POVERTY WHAT WE HAVE FOUND 
OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR IS 
WHILE WE HAVE DONE A LOT FOR 
FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN AND 
PENSIONERS WE COULD DO MORE FOR 
OTHER GROUPS AFFECTED BY THE 
CHANGES 
IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE LIKE CHANGES THIS YOU FEEL PASSIONATELY ABOUT 
POVERTY BUT THERE WAS NO WAY THAT 
THIS WAS THE WAY THIS POLICY WAS 
MEANT TO DEVELOP HOW DO YOU NOW 
TURN YOUR PREMIERSHIP AROUND SOW 
ARE NOT ATTACKED IN THE WAY YOU ARE 
AND PUSHED ABOUT AS MANY PEOPLE 
FEEL HAVE YOU BEEN BY YOUR OWN 
PARTY 
I DON'T THINK I'VE BEEN PARTY PUSHED ABOUT AT ALL WHAT I'VE DONE 
IS LOOKED AND MADE THE RIGHT LONG 
TERM DECISION I'VE NEVER SHIRKED 
FROM THE DIFFICULT DECISION IN 
POLITICS WHETHER IT WAS MAKING THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND INDEPENDENT ON THE 
FIRST DAY I WAS CHANCELLOR OF THE 
EXCHEQUER OR TAKING THE LONG TERM 
DECISIONS THAT ARE TOUGH ABOUT 
INFLATION SOMETIMES VERY UNPOPULAR 
TO DO SO 
I THOUGHT IN PRIME 
MINISTER'S QUESTION TIME YOU 
LOOKED LIKE A MAN RELEASED IN SOME 
WAY A SORT OF ANGER THAT PEOPLE 
WERE TAKING YOU ON AND PASSION 
ABOUT THE CAUSES YOU BELIEVE IN 
HAS THERE BEEN A FRUSTRATION YOU 
HAVE FELT IN RECENT WEEKS ABOUT 
THIS 
I BELIEVE WE ARE MAKING THE THIS RIGHT LONG TERM DECISIONS FOR THE 
BRITISH PEOPLE L. BELIEVE I HAVE 
LISTENED TO PEOPLE'S CONCERNS ABOUT 
PARTICULAR GROUPS WHO OTHERWISE 
WOULD NOT DO AS WELL L. BELIEVE 
IT'S RIGHT TO RESPOND WHERE THERE 
ARE LOW PAID PEOPLE IN DIFFICULTY 
OR WHETHER THERE ARE PEOPLE JUST 
BELOW THE PENSION AGE WHO FIND THEY 
DON'T GET THE BENEFITS THAT OTHER 
PEOPLE MIGHT OTHERWISE GET L. MEAN 
MY WHOLE MISSION IN POLITICS IS TO 
DO WHAT I CAN TO HELP PEOPLE IF I 
CAN FIND WITH THE CHANCELLOR 
RESOURCES TO HELP PEOPLE THAT'S 
THE RIGHT THING TO DO THAT MEANS 
MAKING THE RIGHT LONG TERM 
DECISIONS FOR BRITAIN AND YOU HAVE 
TO JUDGE WHAT IS RIGHT AT EVERY 
POINT AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT A 
DECISION THAT WAS MADE A YEAR AGO 
AND LOOK AT BETTER THINGS YOU CAN 
DO NOW THAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO 
PROCEED 
HOWEVER MANY TIMES HE PROCEED REPEATS AND IT WAS A GREAT DEAL 
THAT PHRASE ABOUT RIGHT LONG TERM 
DECISIONS THE PRIME MINISTER KNOWS 
THAT THE COUNTRY KNOWS THAT HE HAS 
TAKEN A SHORT TERM DECISION TO 
AVOID A POSSIBLE DEFEAT IN THE 
COMMONS AND HUMILIATION IN FRONT OF 
THE COUNTRY 
HOW CLOSE DID ALL OF THIS COME TO 
BEING A REAL THREAT TO HIS 
PREMIERSHIP 
THERE WAS CERTAINLY A PREMIERSHIP THREAT HE WOULD BE DEFEATED THAT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE EVE OF VITAL 
ELECTIONS IF THEY HAD OF GONE 
WRONG PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE SAID 
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
HERE IS REALLY EXTRAORDINARY THE 
PRIME MINISTER IS FRUSTRATED WITH 
SOME GOOD REASON HE'S NOT 
ABANDONED HIS TEN P. TAX SCRAPPING HE 
IS ONLY COMPENSATING A FEW HE IS 
ONLY SPENDING A FEW HUNDRED MILLION 
POUNDS HANDLED IN THE RIGHT WAY 
IT IS A RELATIVELY SMALL CHANGE TO 
DEAL WITH THE NUMBER THAT HE 
BELIEVES IS RELATIVELY FEW WHO ARE 
POOR AND LOSING OUT AND YET BY 
STUBBORNLY SETTING HIS FACE IN 
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AGAINST MAKING 
ANY CHANGE AT ALL HE HAS WHAT CAN 
ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A POLITICAL 
HUMILIATION PRETTY MUCH ALL OF HIS 
OWN MAKING HIS ONE HOPE TONIGHT IS 
BEYOND THE WESTMINSTER VILLAGE 
VOTERS DON'T MUCH CARE ABOUT U. 
TURNS THEY CARE WHETHER POLICIES 
ARE RIGHT AND WRONG AND IF IT IS A 
BIG IF THEY FEEL HE HAS DONE THE 
RIGHT THING AND DONE ENOUGH TONIGHT 
ALL OF THE FROTH WILL PASS NICK NICK THANK YOU 
NICK WILL BE TALKING TO THE 
CONSERVATIVE LEADER DAVID CAMERON 
ON TONIGHT'S B. B. C. NEWS AT TEN 
THE B. B. C. HAS LEARNED THAT A THIRD OF 
ALL SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND AND WALES 
WILL BE HIT TOMORROW BY THE FIRST 
NATIONAL TEACHERS' STRIKE FOR TWENTY ONE 
YEARS NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND SCHOOLS WILL BE 
AFFECTED WHEN TEACHERS BELONGING TO 
THE NUT WALK OUT OVER PAY HERE'S 
OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT JAMES 
WESTHEAD WESTHEAD FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PUPILS 
TOMORROW SCHOOL WILL BE OUT TAKE TAKE ONE OF THOSE 
THANK YOU 
READ IT 
WHEN YOU GET HOME 
THEIR TEACHERS 
ARE ON STRIKE OVER PAY FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN TWO DECADES THEIR 
PARENTS FORCED TO MAKE OTHER 
ARRANGEMENTS 
I HAVE FOUR CHILDREN ARRANGEMENTS TWO OF THEM ARE OFF SCHOOL IT'S 
VERY INCONVENIENT IT'S THE FIRST 
STRIKES FOR TWENTY YEARS I DON'T 
REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE 
STRIKING ABOUT THEY APPEAR TO BE 
WELL PAID 
I'M A WORKING PARENT 
AND I'VE JUST I TOTALLY SUPPORT 
THE ACTION THAT THE TEACHERS ARE 
DOING 
IT IS TWENTY ONE YEARS SINCE THE DOING NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS LAST 
STAGED A NATIONWIDE STRIKE IN THE 
NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHY NOW KELLY DE BEERS IS 
ONE OF A NEW GENERATION WHO HAVE 
SEEN THEIR PAY RISE SIGNIFICANTLY 
BUT THEY FEAR THAT NOW INFLATION IS 
EATING AWAY THE THEIR GAINS SHE'S 
BEEN OFFERED JUST UNDER TWENTY FIVE PERIODS 
RECOMMENDED BY AN INDEPENDENT 
REVIEW BODY BUT HER UNION SAYS 
TEACHERS NEED AT LEAST FORTY ONE PER CENT TO KEEP 
PACE WITH INFLATION 
WE HAVE HIGH 
MORTGAGE COSTS THAT'S IF YOU ARE 
LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A MORTGAGE WE 
HAVE HIGH FOOD BILLS AND WE HAVE 
VERY VERY HIGH TRANSPORT BILLS 
THOSE ARE THE THREE MAINS THINGS 
THAT HAVE GONE BEYOND INFLATION 
RATES OVER AND BORE THE NORMAL 
DAY TO DAY LIVING IT'S IMPORTANT 
FOR US TO STRIKE 
HOW DOES 
TEACHERS' PAY COMPARE OVER TEN 
YEARS THEIR STARTING SALARY HAS 
RISEN IN REAL TERMS BY ALMOST TEN PER CENT 
MUCH MORE FOR THOSE WITH EXPERIENCE 
THAT'S BETTER THAN FOR A POLICE 
CONSTABLE UP NINE PER CENT BUT TESS LESS 
THAN A NEWLY QUALIFIED NURSE 
POLITICIANS ON ALL SIDES SAY THERE 
IS NO EXCUSE FOR A STRIKE IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO JUV A STRIKE THAT DOES 
DAMAGE TO SCHOOLS ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY WHEN THE CASE FOR THAT 
STRIKE ACTION IS NOT MORE CLEARLY 
MADE AND WHERE ALL OF THE OTHER 
TEACHING UNIONS ARE ACCEPTING THE 
PAY AWARD 
NOT EVERY SCHOOL WILL BE 
AFFECTED AS AROUND TEACHERS ARE IN 
UNIONS THAT DON'T SUPPORT THE 
STRIKE BUT EVEN IF ONE IN FOUR 
SCHOOLS ARE FORCED TO CLOSE MANY 
PARENTS WILL BE INCONVENIENCED 
EVEN SOME CHILDREN SEEMED 
DISAPPOINTED 
TOMORROW IS A STRIKE DISAPPOINTED SO WE CAN'T GO TO SCHOOL WE CAN'T 
LEARN NOTHING INTERESTING IT WILL 
BE BORING 
SOMETIMES I WANT THE 
SCHOOL TO BE SHUT DOWN JUST FOR A 
DAY SO THAT I CAN HAVE SOME FUN 
BUT I REALLY LOVE MY TEACHER AND I 
LOVE MY SCHOOL 
BUT TOMORROW'S 
STRIKE MAY NOT BE THE END OF IT

COURTNEY PINE LEAVES THE CITY 
BEHIND 
A B. B. C. INVESTIGATION HAS FOUND THAT 
FRAUDSTERS TRIED TO STEAL HALF A 
BILLION POUNDS FROM U. K. DEBIT AND 
CREDIT CARDS LAST YEAR THE SCALE 
IS MUCH BIGGER THAN PREVIOUSLY 
THOUGHT AND IT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED 
IT WAS MUCH EASIER TO FIND OUT 
STOLEN DEALS ABOUT DETAILS ABOUT 
CARDS OVER THE NET THIS WOMAN'S 
CREDIT CART DETAILS HAD BEEN 
INTERCEPTED AND STOLEN 
WHEN THE 
STATEMENT CAME IT SHOWED THE 
TRANSACTION IN INDIA 
THE FIRST 
THING SHE KNEW WAS WHEN FOREIGN 
TRANSACTIONS APPEARED ON HER 
STATEMENT HE DETAILS HAD BEEN 
HACKED FROM THE ON LINE RETAILER 
WHERE SHE BOUGHT THE PIANO AND THEN 
SOLD ON TO INTERNATIONAL FRAUDSTERS 
VIA A WEBSITE WE SHOWED MR. DARLING 
THE SITE WHERE WE HAD FOUND HER 
STOLEN DETAILS YOU CAN ESOO THE 
SECURITY CODE FROM THE BACK OF YOUR 
CARD 
OH MY GOODNESS I'M REALLY CARD QUITE SCARED 
BY THE SCALE BY THE 
SCALE AND HOW EASY IT WAS TO DO 
MR. DARLING'S MONEY WAS REFUNDED BY 
HER CREDIT CARD COMPANY AS IN MOST 
CASES SO DOES THIS KIND OF CRIME 
REALLY MATTER WELL YES IT DOES 
BECAUSE THESE COSTS GET PASSED ON 
TO RETAILERS AND THEN TO US THE 
CONSUMERS WHEN JOHN SET UP AN ON 
LINE BUSINESS SELLING INK 
CARTRIDGES FRAUDSTERS USED STOLEN 
CREDIT CARDS TO BUY THIRTY THOUSAND WORTH

CARD YOU USED TO PAY FOR THAT PHONE 
WASN'T ONE YOU WERE THOZ 
AUTHORISED TO USE HE CLAIMS THE 
ORDER WAS MADE BY HIS FRIEND BUT 
THE FRIEND DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE OUR 
CALLS

OF BRITAIN'S MOST EXPENSIVE PETROL 
STATIONS DIESEL AT THIS GATHER IN 
GORDON BROWN'S OWN CONSTITUENCY 
COSTS ONE POINT THREE OH A LITRE THAT IS TWELVE 
PENCE HIGHER THAN THE U. K. AVERAGE 
IT'S THE SAME WITH PETROL IT'S 
ALSO TEN PER CENT UP ON THE NORM OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUSLY THIS STATION HERE IS ALWAYS THE 
MOST EXPENSIVE IN THIS AREA ANY WAY

TALKS HAVE BEEN CONTINUING BETWEEN 
MANAGEMENT AND UNIONS THREATENING 
TO STRIKE AT GRANGEMOUTH ONE OF 
BRITAIN'S OIL REFINERIES AND IF IT 
DOES SHUT DOWN COMPLETELY IT COULD 
CAUSE PROBLEMS BUT PRICES HAVE 
BEEN CREEPING UP FOR A WHILE BRENT BRENT CRUDE IS SOMEWHERE AROUND ONE SEVENTEEN A 
BARREL THAT IS THE MAIN REASON FOR 
THE INCREASE IN THE BASIC PRICE AT 
THE PUMPS
