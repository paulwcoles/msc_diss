WELCOME TO B. B. C. SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
TONIGHT YOU CAN SEE TWO PROGRAMMES FEATURING WYNTON MARSALIS 
HE INVITES A YOUNG AUDIENCE AND A YOUTH ORCHESTRA 
TO JOIN HIS OWN BAND AND EXPLORE A WIDE VARIETY OF MUSICAL STYLES 
THERE'S ALSO A CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE THE DIVERSITY OF ABILITIES 
IN TALENT TWO THOUSAND AS YOUNG PEOPLE SHOW OFF THEIR MUSICAL SKILLS 
I'M WYNTON MARSALIS AND THIS IS THE LIBERTY BRASS BAND 
FROM NEW ORLEANS LOUISIANA 
TONIGHT WE VISIT THE STUDENTS OF THE TANGLEWOOD MUSIC CENTRE WIND BAND 
UNDER THE DIRECTION OF SEIJI OZAWA 
THE STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER BY JOHN PHILIP SOUSA 
THAT WAS A PERFORMANCE OF JOHN PHILIP SOUSA'S THE STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER 
STARS AND STRIPES IS A MARCH 
A MARCH IS A COMPOSITION FOR THE ORGANISED STEPS 
OF MILITARY TROOPS MARCHING IN FORMATION 
A MARCH CAN CELEBRATE AN IMPORTANT OCCASION OR A PLACE YOU LIKE 
THEY CAN BE USED TO INSPIRE PATRIOTIC FEELINGS 
IF YOU FEEL BAD ABOUT WHERE YOU'RE FROM YOU LISTEN TO A MARCH 
AND SAY IT'S O. K. WHERE I'M FROM 
WE SELDOM HEAR GOOD MARCHES TODAY OR A BAD ONE FOR THAT MATTER 
WE ONLY HEAR A WIND BAND AT A FOOTBALL GAME OR A PARADE 
OR IF WE'RE FORCED TO GO TO THOSE TERRIBLE SCHOOL CONCERTS 
AND LISTEN TO OUR RELATIVES PLAY 
THIS IS A WIND BAND 
IT'S CALLED A WIND BAND BECAUSE THERE ARE NO STRINGED INSTRUMENTS 
ONLY PERCUSSION INSTRUMENTS 
IT HAS A BRASS SECTION TRUMPETS TROMBONES TUBA FRENCH HORN 
A WOODWIND SECTION FLUTE PICCOLO OBOE BASSOON CLARINET SAXOPHONE 
A PERCUSSION SECTION SNARE DRUM BASS DRUM CYMBALS AND TRIANGLES 
AFTER THE CIVIL WAR THE WIND BAND WAS MOST POPULAR IN THE NORTH EAST 
BY THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY TOWNS ALL OVER THE U. S. A. 
HAD BANDS OF VARIOUS SIZES THAT WOULD PLAY FOR PICNICS CHURCHES 
ATHLETIC CONTESTS DANCES POLITICAL RALLIES EVEN THOSE MEDICINE SHOWS 
WHERE THEY'D SELL THINGS LIKE BEAR GREASE TO CURE RHEUMATISM 
THE TYPICAL WIND BAND PLAY A WIDE VARIETY OF MUSIC 
FROM HYMNS TO OPERATIC OVERTURES TO MINSTREL'S SONGS AND MARCHES 
JOHN PHILIP SOUSA ORGANISED AND CONDUCTED 
THE MOST FAMOUS WIND BAND IN THE U. S. A. SIMPLY NAMED SOUSA'S BAND 
THEY TOURED THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD FOR ABOUT FORTY YEARS 
ALTHOUGH SOUSA'S BAND PLAYED AN UNBELIEVABLE RANGE OF MUSIC 
HE IS MOST REMEMBERED FOR COMPOSING MARCHES 
THESE MARCHES INFUSED EUROPEAN STYLE WITH THE NEW AMERICAN OPTIMISM 
TONIGHT WE'LL SEE HOW THE WIND BAND IS RELATED TO THE JAZZ BAND 
SPECIFICALLY ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE EARLY NEW ORLEANS AND LOUISIANA JAZZ 
NOW BEFORE WE GET INTO AN ACTUAL DISCUSSION OF JAZZ 
WE MUST FIRST VISIT RAGTIME MUSIC 
RAGTIME WAS PIANO MUSIC BORN IN THE MID WEST 
IT WAS A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE MUSIC OF THE WIND BANDS AND EARLY JAZZ 
WHICH WAS BORN IN THE SOUTH LET'S LISTEN TO THE MAPLE LEAF RAG 
WRITTEN BY RAGTIME'S GREATEST COMPOSER SCOTT JOPLIN 
THE MAPLE LEAF RAG BY SCOTT JOPLIN 
RAGTIME CAME FROM AN IMPROVISED MUSIC STYLE CALLED RAGGING 
RAGGING MEANS YOU MAKE A MELODY RAGGED 
BY CHANGING ITS NOTES AND RHYTHMS RAGGING WAS AN AMERICAN VERSION 
OF AFRICAN MUSICAL STYLE WHICH FEATURED SYNCOPATION 
SYNCOPATION MEANS ACCENTING ON UNEXPECTED BEATS 
THIS SYNCOPATION WAS APPLIED TO ALL TYPES OF SONGS TO MAKE THEM FUN 
THIS IS SOMETHING WE ALL KNOW ABOUT IF YOU PLAY WITH A SONG LIKE 
ROW ROW ROW YOUR BOAT 
THAT'S RAGGING 
RAGTIME MUSIC IS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN RAGGING WAS WRITTEN DOWN 
AND APPLIED TO MARCHES AND OTHER MORE COMPLEX MUSIC 
REMEMBER THAT THIS WAS BEFORE THE ADVENT OF THE RADIO 
LET ALONE TELEVISION AND VIDEOS AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
THE CENTRE OF FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT IN THE HOME WAS THE PARLOUR PIANO 
IF YOU HAD ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY ONE RAGTIME MUSIC WAS PERFECT 
FOR EVERY HOME'S PIANO THE RAG ALSO SOUNDED GOOD ON A PLAYER PIANO 
THAT'S A PIANO WHICH PLAYED ITSELF WITH THE AID OF A PIANO ROLL 
THE KEY TO RAGTIME'S SUCCESS WAS THE JOYOUS OPTIMISM OF ITS SYNCOPATION 
AND THE DANCE ABILITY OF ITS BEAT EVERYBODY LIKES TO DANCE 
IT BECAME THE MOST POPULAR MUSICAL ART OF AMERICA FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
AND WAS EVENTUALLY ARRANGED FOR ALL TYPES OF MUSICAL ENSEMBLES 
EVEN ODD COMBINATIONS OF STRINGS AND WINDS WHICH WE'LL HEAR IN A MOMENT 
RAGTIME CHANGED THE SOUND OF TRADITIONAL MARCHES 
LET'S SEE HOW 
FIRST THE SYNCOPATION WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
THIS IS A PHRASE WITHOUT SYNCOPATION 
MAPLE LEAF RAG 
NOW THE SAME PHRASE SYNCOPATED 
SECONDLY RAGTIME MELODIES COVER A WIDE RANGE 
TRADITIONAL MARCH MELODIES STAY WITHIN A MUCH SMALLER RANGE 
THEN USING BROKEN CHORDS IN A PERCUSSIVE STYLE 
WHICH IMITATES THE BANJO NOW WHAT IS A BROKEN CHORD 
WELL THIS IS A CHORD 
THIS IS A BROKEN CHORD 
YOU KNOW HOW BANJOS PICK LIKE 
DUNK A DUNK A DUNK A DUNK A DUNK A G. DUNK A BOM BOM 
RIGHT WHAT DOES THIS SOUND LIKE 
MAPLE LEAF RAG 
YOU SEE D. UNK A DUNK A LIKE A BANJO 
HERE ARE SOME SIMILARITIES BETWEEN RAGS AND MARCHES 
FIRST WOULD BE THE TWO BEAT FEEL 
THAT'S WHAT GIVES THE MARCH THE OOM PA OOM PA SOUND 
AND HERE'S HOW THAT SOUNDS IN RAGTIME 
THEN WE HAVE SIXTEEN BAR STRAINS WHICH ARE REPEATED 
NOW I NEED YOU ALL TO COUNT SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THIS 
SIX SEVEN EIGHT 
NINE TEN ELEVEN 
TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN 
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN 
WHAT ABOUT THE SOUSA MARCH 
WE HEAR SIXTEEN BARS 
ALSO A MIDDLE STRAIN CALLED TRIO 
WHICH HAS A GENTLER QUALITY IT'S SOFTER RELAXED 
AND IT'S IN ANOTHER KEY 
EVERY NOTE OF RAGTIME IN MARCHES WAS WRITTEN DOWN 
NOT IMPROVISED 
LET'S LISTEN AGAIN TO SCOTT JOPLIN'S MAPLE LEAF RAG 
THE MAPLE LEAF RAG BY SCOTT JOPLIN 
THE SOUSA STYLE OF WIND BAND PLAYING RAGGING AND RAGTIME 
ALL MET IN NEW ORLEANS LOUISIANA SOME TIME AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY FIVE 
TO FORM A STYLE THAT WE CALL JAZZ 
NEW ORLEANS HAD A UNIQUE MIXTURE OF PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD 
FRENCH SPANISH MANY AFRICANS CREOLES AND NATIVE AMERICANS 
WHAT DISTINGUISHED NEW ORLEANS FROM OTHER AMERICAN CITIES AT THAT TIME 
WAS THE INTEGRATION OF THESE DIVERSE GROUPS 
THEY SHARED NEIGHBOURHOODS CULTURE AND PUBLIC LIFE THIS PRODUCED A UNIQUE TYPE OF AMERICAN MUSICIAN 
WHO WAS INFLUENCED BY AMERICAN VERSIONS OF EUROPEAN STYLES AND AFRICAN STYLES THE JAZZ MUSICIAN 
JAZZ MUSICIANS STRIVE TO SOUND PERSONAL TO SOUND LIKE THEMSELVES 
TO BE IDENTIFIED AS SUCH 
THEY IMPROVISE MELODIES THAT MEANS SPONTANEOUS MUSICAL INVENTION 
IT'S LIKE WHEN WE TALK WE USE WORDS TO MAKE UP WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SAY 
THE JAZZ MUSICIAN DOES THE SAME THING BUT WITH NOTES 
HERE'S SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT JAZZ MUSICIANS CAN DO 
IF YOU WANT TO GET A VOCAL SOUND LIKE A WHINE YOU MIGHT GO 
SO IN THE CONTEXT OF PLAYING YOU USE DIFFERENT SOUNDS 
YOU MAY HAVE A LITTLE MELODY 
PUT A LITTLE SWEETNESS IN THERE THEN 
AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF NEW ORLEANS' JAZZ 
THE JAZZ MUSICIANS WANT TO CONVERSE WITH EACH OTHER USING MUSIC 
THIS MEANS THE MUSICIANS MUST LISTEN INTERACT AND PLAY AT THE SAME TIME 
YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO CHANGE YOUR MUSICAL IDEA QUICKLY 
AND THE JAZZ MUSICIAN HAS TO HAVE GOOD MANNERS 
THAT MEANS DON'T PLAY TOO LOUD AND DON'T PLAY TOO MUCH 
EVEN THOUGH THE MUSIC SOUNDS VERY DIFFERENT 
THE JAZZ BAND IS ORGANISED IN THE SAME WAY AS THE SOUSA BAND 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE APART THE TRADITIONAL MARCH HIGH SOCIETY AND SEE HOW THEY RELATE TO EACH OTHER 
WE'LL START AT THE BOTTOM IN THE SOUSA STYLE WIND BAND 
THE BASS DRUM GENERALLY PLAYS WITH THE CYMBALS ON ONE AND THREE 
ONE TWO THREE 
WHEREAS IN THE JAZZ BAND THE BASS DRUM PLAYS ON ONE AND THREE 
BUT THE CYMBAL IS PLAYED WITH A WIRE BEATER ON TWO AND FOUR 
THE CATCH IS THAT THE BASS DRUM ACCENTS EVERY SECOND FOURTH BEAT 
IT SOUNDS VERY COMPLICATED 
BUT WHEN YOU LISTEN TO IT IT'LL MAKE A LOT OF SENSE 
THE BASS DRUM AND THE CYMBAL HAVE AN IMPROVISED CONVERSATION 
SIMULTANEOUS RHYTHMIC BEAT 
NEXT IS THE SNARE DRUM 
IN THE SOUSA STYLE MARCH THE SNARE DRUM PLAYS SOME TYPE OF WRITTEN PATTERN THAT IS REPEATED TO FORM 
WHAT WE CALL A CADENCE IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS 
MULTI BEAT RHYTHM 
WHEREAS IN THE JAZZ BAND THE SNARE DRUM IMPROVISES DIFFERENT CADENCES 
WHICH ARE SYNCOPATED AND CONVERSE WITH THE BASS DRUM AND THE CYMBAL 
THIS IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE ONE TWO 
POLYRHYTHMIC BEAT 
THE TUBA OR SOUSAPHONE IN THE WIND BAND ACCENTS ONE IN THREE 
TO MAKE THAT OOM PA OOM PA OOM THEY'RE THE OOM OF THE OOM PA SOUND 
THAT CHARACTERISES THE MARCH 
IN THE JAZZ BAND THE TUBA SYNCOPATES WITH A SKIPPING TYPE OF EFFECT 
AND CONVERSES WITH THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS LET'S CHECK IT OUT 
THE FIRST TRUMPET IN THE WIND BAND ALMOST ALWAYS PLAYS THE MELODY 
WHILE THE SECOND AND THIRD TRUMPET REINFORCE THE MELODY WITH HARMONY 
IN THOSE DAYS MUSICIANS PLAYED THE CORNET BUT THE TECHNIQUE IS MUCH THE SAME AS THE TRUMPET 
BUT THE CORNET HAS A SOFTER MORE MELLOW SOUND THE TRUMPET IS CUTER 
THE SECOND AND THIRD TRUMPET CAN PLAY A PART THAT REINFORCES THE RHYTHM 
IT SOUNDS LIKE A DRUM PART PLAYED ON THE TRUMPET HERE'S AN EXAMPLE 
DID YOU HEAR THAT D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. D. A. BR R. R. R. R. IT COULD'VE BEEN PLAYED ON THE SNARE DRUM 
IN JAZZ THE TRUMPET IS THE LEAD INSTRUMENT 
THE FIRST TRUMPET PLAYS THE MELODY THE SECOND WILL IMPROVISE 
A LITTLE HARMONISATION AROUND THAT MELODY 
AS WITH ALL JAZZ INSTRUMENTS IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO LISTEN TO HOW WE INTERPRET THE RHYTHMS 
AND THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A MUSICAL CONVERSATION 
YOU'LL HEAR US TALKING TO EACH OTHER THAT'S WHAT WE DO 
THE CLARINETS FLUTES AND PICCOLOS IN THE WIND BAND 
CAN PLAY THE MAIN MELODY IN A HIGH REGISTER AND IT'LL SOUND LIKE THIS 
OR THEY CAN EMBELLISH THE MELODY WITH A FANCY HIGH PART 
IN JAZZ MUSIC THE CLARINET DOES THE SAME THING 
IT EITHER REINFORCES THE MELODY OR IMPROVISES A HIGH FANCY PART 
THE TROMBONES IN THE WIND BAND PLAY A LOWER MELODY PART 
AND THIS PART IS CALLED A COUNTER MELODY 
TROMBONE HARMONY 
OR THEY CAN PLAY A RHYTHM PART 
IT'S THE PA OF OOM PA OOM PA 
IN THE JAZZ BAND THE TROMBONE PLAYS A SLIDING OR GROWLING VERSION 
OF THAT LOW COUNTER MELODY IT'S UP TO THE TROMBONIST TO CHOOSE HOW TO INTERPRET HIS PART 
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WHATEVER HE PLAYS WORKS WITH ALL OF THE OTHER IMPROVISED PARTS 
TROMBONE JAZZ HARMONY 
THE JAZZ BAND DOESN'T HAVE A BASSOON OBOE 
FRENCH HORN OR FLUTE IN MOST CASES 
NO MATTER THE INSTRUMENTATION OR SIZE OF THE BAND WHETHER IT'S THE WIND BAND OR THE JAZZ BAND 
ALL OF THE INSTRUMENTS ARE DIVIDED TO PERFORM TWO BASIC FUNCTIONS 
ONE IS TO PLAY THE MELODY OR A COUNTER MELODY 
AND NUMBER TWO IS TO GIVE SOME INTERPRETATION OF THE RHYTHM PART 
THAT'S BU B. A. B. A. B. A. OR OOM PA OOM PA 
LET'S LISTEN TO A COMPLETE PERFORMANCE OF HIGH SOCIETY 
DONE IN THE STYLE OF NEW ORLEANS' JAZZ 
HIGH SOCIETY ARRANGED BY WYCLIFFE GORDON 
WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES NEW ORLEANS' JAZZ 
SOUND SO DISTINCTIVE OR COMPLEX 
WE COULD SAY IMPROVISATION BUT THERE WAS A TRADITION OF IMPROVISATION IN BAROQUE MUSIC 
WHICH WAS WRITTEN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO 
AND MANY KINDS OF MUSIC STILL USE IMPROVISATION 
LIKE BLUEGRASS SALSA INDIAN ROCK AND SO ON MANY KINDS 
IT'S COLLECTIVE IMPROVISATION THAT DISTINGUISHES NEW ORLEANS' JAZZ FROM OTHER MUSIC 
THE INSTRUMENTS IMPROVISE TOGETHER WE HAVE A COLLECTIVE CONVERSATION 
THIS MEANS THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING SO THAT YOU CAN CO OPERATE 
IMPROVISATION DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU PLAY WHATEVER YOU WANT 
IT MEANS YOU CREATE SOMETHING THAT WILL FIT WITH WHAT OTHER MUSICIANS ARE PLAYING 
HERE'S SOME GROUP IMPROVISATION TECHNIQUES A GROOVE 
A GROOVE IS THE CO ORDINATION OF DIFFERENT RHYTHMS 
A LOT OF WHAT WE HEAR HAS A BEAT DON'T CONFUSE A BEAT WITH A GROOVE 
A BEAT IS ONE MOMENT IN THE LIFE OF A GROOVE HERE'S A BEAT 
SIMPLE RHYTHMIC BEAT 
IT'S THE SAME THING REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH ALMOST NO CHANGE 
NOW THE RHYTHMS OF A GROOVE ARE ALWAYS CHANGING 
THIS GIVES THE DRUMMERS MUSICAL FREEDOM OF CHOICE IN NEW ORLEANS' JAZZ ALL OF THE IMPROVISED RHYTHMS 
WILL COME TOGETHER ON THAT SECOND FOURTH BEAT THAT WE SHOWED YOU HERE'S AN EXAMPLE 
WHEN MORE THAN ONE MELODY IS PLAYED AT A TIME 
WE CALL THAT POLYPHONY 
THIS IS CONFUSING TO US BECAUSE WE'RE USED TO HEARING 
ONLY ONE MELODY AT A TIME 
OUR EAR DOESN'T KNOW WHO TO PAY ATTENTION TO IT'S LIKE LISTENING TO TWO CONVERSATIONS AT ONCE 
IF THAT HAPPENS WITH THE BAND JUST MAKE SURE YOU LISTEN TO THE TRUMPETS 
IF WE LEARN TO HEAR REGISTERS 
THE POLYPHONY IS EASIER TO IDENTIFY REGISTERS ARE LIKE ALTITUDES 
YOU KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE FOR PLANES TO FLY ABOVE AND BELOW EACH OTHER 
WITH ENOUGH DISTANCE IN BETWEEN SO THEY CAN LEAVE NEW YORK TOGETHER 
AND ARRIVE IN BOSTON AT THE SAME TIME 
THIS IS HOW POLYPHONY IN THE WIND BAND AND THE JAZZ BAND WORKS 
ALL OF THE INSTRUMENTS OCCUPY DIFFERENT REGISTERS AND BEGIN AND END 
AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT GETTING IN EACH OTHER'S WAY 
LET'S LISTEN TO THIS FAMOUS STRAIN FROM STARS AND STRIPES AND WE'LL HEAR AN EXAMPLE OF POLYPHONY 
WHAT DID WE JUST HEAR 
CERTAINLY WE HEARD THE PICCOLOS AND THE MELODY 
DEE DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO BUT DID WE NOTICE THE TROMBONES 
THAT'S THE EFFECT OF POLYPHONY 
IT'S HARD TO LISTEN TO ALL THOSE INSTRUMENTS PLAYING TOGETHER 
AT THE SAME TIME PLAYING DIFFERENT MELODIES 
YOU REMEMBER WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ALTITUDES 
AND THE PLANES LEAVING BOSTON AND FLYING ON TOP OF EACH OTHER 
WELL HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE INSTRUMENTS IN THE BAND PLAY IN DIFFERENT REGISTERS 
OUR PICCOLOS ARE UP AT THIRTY ZERO ZERO ZERO F. T. 
THEN THE FLUTE IS AROUND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
NOW WE HAVE THE CLARINET THE TRUMPET AND THE SAXOPHONE 
BETWEEN TWENTY THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN ZERO ZERO ZERO F. T. 
WE'RE GOING TO BRING OUR TROMBONE OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS SLIDING AROUND DOING DIFFERENT THINGS 
YOU CAN HELP ME RAISE HIM UP 
NOW THE TROMBONE GENERALLY IS SLIDING AROUND HERE AT TEN ZERO ZERO ZERO F. T. 
LET'S TRY AND HEAR THESE INSTRUMENTS IN THEIR DIFFERENT REGISTERS 
POLYPHONIC RENDITION 
NOW IN JAZZ POLYPHONY THE CLARINET PLAYS IN THE HIGH REGISTER AND ALSO PLAYS FASTER NOTES 
THE TRUMPET PLAYS IN THE MIDDLE REGISTER AND MIDDLE RHYTHM NOTES 
AND THE TROMBONE PLAYS IN THE LOWER REGISTER IN SLOWER LONGER NOTES 
ELONGATED LOW PITCHED 
IN ORDER FOR THIS TO WORK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO CO ORDINATE THE RHYTHMS AND THE REGISTERS 
NOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR AN EXAMPLE OF NEW ORLEANS' THREE PART POLYPHONY ON THE STARS AND STRIPES 
TAILGATING IS THE SLIDING STYLE OF TROMBONE PLAYING 
IT'S AN IMPORTANT SPICE 
IN NEW ORLEANS' JAZZ BUT IT CAN BE OVERDONE TO MAKE THE MUSIC SOUND LIKE A JOKE OR CORNY 
IT'S CALLED TAILGATING BECAUSE MUSICIANS USED TO DRIVE THROUGH CITIES 
ADVERTISING DIFFERENT EVENTS 
THE TROMBONE IS SLIDING SO HE WOULD HIT THE OTHER MUSICIANS 
THEY WOULD MAKE HIM HANG THAT SLIDE OUT THE BACK OF THE TRUCK 
THE BACK OF A TRUCK IS A TAILGATE 
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF TAILGATING UH UH UH UH UH UH 
THE MOST COMMON WAY THAT MUSICIANS 
CONVERSE IN JAZZ IS CALLED CALL AND RESPONSE WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH THIS 
BECAUSE THIS IS HOW WE TALK EVERY DAY 
IF I SAY I LIKE THAT DALLAS COWBOYS' HAT 
YOU SAY I WENT TO THE SUPER BOWL ONE SAW THEM BEAT THE BUFFALO BILLS 
I SAY I CHEERED THE BUFFALOS YOU SAY HOW COULD YOU CHEER FOR THEM 
IT'S CALL AND RESPONSE 
I SAY WHY DO I KEEP CHEERING FOR THEM THEY LOSE EVERY YEAR 
WE ALL KNOW THIS CALL AND RESPONSE 
SHAVE AND A HAIRCUT TWO BITS 
BUT IN JAZZ OUR CALL AND RESPONSE GOES ON BETWEEN INSTRUMENTS AND IT CAN TAKE PLACE AT ANY TIME 
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF A CALL AND RESPONSE BETWEEN THE TRUMPET AND THE CLARINET 
MUSICIANS PLAY A REPEATED PHRASE 
NOW THIS PHRASE IS CALLED A RIFF 
IT REINFORCES THE GROOVE 
A RIFF IS LIKE A ROAD SIGN YOU SEE NEW YORK FIFTEEN MILES 
NEW YORK TEN MILES NEW YORK FIVE MILES AS YOU GET CLOSER TO NEW YORK 
THE ROAD SIGN MAKES YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE 
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF A RIFF UH UH UH UH UH UH 
AT CERTAIN TIMES IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A PIECE OF JAZZ 
THE ENTIRE BAND WILL STOP AND ONE MUSICIAN HAS A SHORT SOLO SPOT BEFORE THE BAND COMES BACK IN 
THIS IS CALLED A BREAK 
A BREAK IS JUST LIKE A. 
YOU KNOW HOW YOU GO TO THE CIRCUS AND YOU SEE THE TRAPEZE ARTISTS AND THEY'RE GOING BACK AND FORTH 
THEN THEY LET ONE GO AND HE FLIPS IN THE AIR AND ANOTHER ONE GRABS THEM 
THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE THE BREAK IS THAT MOMENT WHEN ONE PERSON IS SWINGING THROUGH THE AIR 
FIRST YOU SWING THEN YOU FALL THEN YOU START SWINGING AGAIN 
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF A BREAK 
LET'S LISTEN TO A NEW ORLEANS STANDARD IT'S ENTITLED THE WHOOPIN' BLUES 
I WANT YOU ALL TO TRY AND HEAR GROOVES BREAKS POLYPHONIC PLAYING 
RIFFS AND THE TROMBONE TAILGATING 
AS A MATTER OF FACT WE HAVE A CALL AND RESPONSE IN HERE FOR YOU 
WHEN YOU HEAR ME SAY B. A. RA B. A. A. A. A. A. RA YOU SAY HEY 
ALL RIGHT SO HERE WE GO 
THE WHOOPIN' BLUES WITH THE HEY IN THE BREAK 
B. A. RA B. A. A. A. A. A. RA HEY 
B. A. RA B. A. A. A. A. A. RA HEY 
THE WHOOPIN' BLUES 
B. A. RA B. A. A. A. A. A. RA HEY 
B. A. RA B. A. A. A. A. A. RA HEY 
B. A. RA B. A. A. A. A. A. RA HEY 
B. A. RA B. A. A. A. A. A. RA HEY 
B. A. RA B. A. A. A. A. A. RA HEY 
B. A. RA B. A. A. A. A. A. RA HEY 
THE MOST POPULAR PART OF A WIND BAND CONCERT WAS THE PERFORMANCE OF A CORNET SOLOIST 
MEN LIKE JULES LEVY HERBERT L. CLARKE AND MATTHEW ARBUCKLE 
BECAME FAMOUS FOR DISPLAYS OF IMPOSSIBLE TECHNICAL VIRTUOSITY 
THINGS LIKE DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TONGUE AND PLAYING HIGH NOTES 
OR TWO AND THREE HORNS AT ONE TIME 
THESE WERE MEN WITH UNIQUE SOUNDS INDIVIDUALISTIC AND SOMETIMES BOMBASTIC PERSONALITIES 
THEY HAD ONE CONCERT BILLED AS A BATTLE OF TWO CORNETISTS 
MATTHEW ARBUCKLE AND JULES LEVY STOPPED BLOWING THEIR HORNS AND LITERALLY CAME TO BLOWS 
THEIR TECHNIQUES ESTABLISHED THE FOUNDATIONS OF TRUMPET PLAYING STILL IN USE TODAY 
THIS SHOWS HOW SOLOISTS PUT THESE VARIOUS TECHNIQUES ON DISPLAY 
WE HAVE A STUDENT OF THE TANGLEWOOD MUSIC CENTRE WIND BAND MARK INOUYE 
TO PLAY FOR US THE FAMOUS ARBAN VARIATIONS ON THE CARNIVAL OF VENICE 
CORNET SOLO 
THE ORIGINATOR OF JAZZ WAS BUDDY BOLDEN WELL THAT'S WHAT FOLKS SAY 
BUDDY BOLDEN PLAYED THE CORNET LIKE NO ONE BEFORE 
HIS VIRTUOSITY WAS IN THE PERSONALITY OF HIS SOUND THE MASTERY OF VOCAL EFFECTS LIKE CRYING 
LAUGHING MOANING AND THE ABILITY TO CREATE MEMORABLE PHRASES WHILE HE WAS ALSO SYNCOPATING WITH STYLE 
THEY SAY HE COULD PLAY SO LOUD THAT HE COULD MAKE THE RAIN STAY UP IN THE SKY 
THE FIRST GREAT SOLOIST WAS LOUIS ARMSTRONG ALSO A TRUMPETER 
HE IMPROVISED FULL SOLOS WITH RELATED PHRASES STRUNG TOGETHER 
THE THING ABOUT PLAYING LONGER IS YOU HAVE TO STICK TO THE POINT 
IT'S JUST LIKE TALKING THE LONGER YOU TALK THE MORE YOU RAMBLE LIKE I'M DOING RIGHT NOW 
LOUIS ARMSTRONG IS THE MODEL FOR JAZZ TRUMPETING 
HE HAD A ROUND SOUND HE PLAYED WITH TREMENDOUS FIRE AND IMAGINATION 
HIS SOLOS ARE SO LOGICAL THAT THOUGH IMPROVISED THEY SEEM TO BE WRITTEN DOWN 
THIS IS A LOUIS ARMSTRONG COMPOSITION 
ENTITLED CORNET CHOP SUEY 
TONIGHT WE'VE SHOWN YOU HOW THE TRADITION OF WIND BAND PLAYING INFLUENCED NEW ORLEANS' JAZZ 
HOPEFULLY THIS BROUGHT YOU CLOSER TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THINGS THAT MAY SEEM DIFFERENT ON THE OUTSIDE 
CAN ACTUALLY BE QUITE SIMILAR 
LISTEN FOR THE SIMILARITIES IN THE WIND BAND AND THE JAZZ BAND 
MANHATTAN BEACH MARCH THANK YOU 
MANHATTAN BEACH BY JOHN PHILIP SOUSA 
CADENZA FROM CELLO CONCERTO N. O. ONE IN E. FLAT BY DMITRI SHOSTAKOVICH 
THIS IS WYNTON MARSALIS VISITING THE TANGLEWOOD MUSIC FESTIVAL IN BERKSHIRES MASSACHUSETTS 
WE ARE EXPLORING WAYS THAT DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC RELATE TO EACH OTHER 
AND HOW A TRAINING IN MUSIC CAN HELP YOU WITH ANY TYPE OF TRAINING 
INTELLECTUAL YOU READ BOOKS AND DEVELOP YOUR MIND 
ATHLETIC YOU DO PUSH UPS IF YOU WANT TO LOOK CUTE 
OR WHATEVER SKILL YOU WANT TO DEVELOP 
MY GUEST IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST AND FAVOURITE MUSICIANS 
MR. YO YO MA 
WHO BRINGS JOY TO AUDIENCES ALL OVER THE WORLD 
WITH PERFORMANCES OF CLASSICAL MUSIC LIKE THAT SHOSTAKOVICH CONCERTO WE'VE JUST HEARD 
MANY OF US WHEN SEEING A GREAT MUSICIAN IN CONCERT OR A GREAT ATHLETE HIT THE WINNING HOME RUN 
OR EVEN IF WE EAT A GOOD MEAL AT A RESTAURANT WE'RE INSPIRED TO BECOME MUSICIANS OR ATHLETES 
OR EVEN A CHEF 
EXPERIENCING GREAT THINGS CAN MOTIVATE US TO WANT TO BE GREAT OURSELVES 
WHATEVER THE CASE IT TAKES MANY LONG HOURS OF PRACTISING 
TO BECOME GOOD LET ALONE GREAT 
AND ALWAYS 
THE LARGE MONSTER OF PRACTISING COMES TO TRAMPLE ON OUR DREAMS 
ALMOST NO ONE LIKES TO PRACTISE THAT'S THE TRUTH 
WE ALL WANT TO BE HEROES BUT WE JUST DON'T WANT TO FIGHT THE DRAGON 
THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE I MEAN DRAGONS HAVE BAD BREATH 
I HATE TO ADMIT IT BUT I HATE PRACTISING 
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE SAYING THIS 
BUT UM YOU KNOW EVEN NOW 
UM I DON'T LIKE THE THOUGHT OF PRACTISING THAT'S RIGHT 
PRACTISING IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT 
ESPECIALLY IF IT'S TRULY PRACTISING 
FIRST YOU HAVE TO SPEND TIME WORKING ON THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T DO 
IT MAKES YOU FEEL BAD AND OFTEN IS TERRIBLY BORING 
THE SAME THING REPEATED OVER AND OVER UNTIL YOU GET IT 
YOU HAVE TO BE INSPIRED TO WANT TO PRACTISE 
THERE MUST BE SOME REASON BESIDES I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A BAD GRADE OR MY PARENTS WILL KILL ME 
OR I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO 
IF YOU WANT TO BE GOOD AT ANYTHING YOU'VE GOT TO PRACTISE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT 
PRACTISING HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH ME 
BUT ONCE I GET TO PRACTISING IT'S O. K. 
BECAUSE I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO WORK ON TO FOCUS ON 
I LOVE TO LEARN NEW THINGS 
YOU KNOW KIND OF TAKE A RISK AND GO OUT AND CHALLENGE MYSELF 
THEN IF I CAN MAKE IT BOY IT'S VERY EXCITING 
AND ONE OF THE EXCITING THINGS 
ABOUT MEETING YOU IS THAT YOU KNOW I THOUGHT 
GEE MAYBE I CAN GET HIM TO UM TEACH ME SOMETHING 
AND SO YOU KNOW I ASKED YOU WHAT YOUR FAVOURITE PIECE WAS AND UM YOU SAID IT WAS MOOD INDIGO 
THE REASON I LIKE MOOD INDIGO MOOD INDIGO IS A COMPOSITION BY DUKE ELLINGTON 
IS FIRST IT'S VERY SIMPLE IT HAS A MELODY THAT'S JUST 
YOU CAN ALMOST SEE PEOPLE WALKING DOWN THE STREET TAKING THEIR TIME 
ABOUT TO HAVE A GOOD TIME 
SO UH I'D BE HONOURED TO SHOW YOU THIS 
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY WITH THE BAND THAT'S GREAT MOOD INDIGO GOOD 
MOOD INDIGO BY ELLINGTON BIGARD AND MILLS 
WYNTON THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH REALLY SOMETHING ELSE 
NOW WE MAY HAVE BE INSPIRED TO PRACTISE BUT WE MAY NOT KNOW HOW 
YOU DO MORE DAMAGE THAN GOOD BY PRACTISING THE WRONG WAY 
IT'S LIKE GETTING A WEIGHTS SET BECAUSE YOU WANT TO DEVELOP MUSCLES 
BUT YOU LIFT WEIGHTS EVERY DAY AND WORK THE SAME MUSCLES WELL THIS IS THE WRONG WAY TO LIFT WEIGHTS 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LIFT EVERY OTHER DAY 
THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU WYNTON'S WAYS TO PRACTISE 
THESE WAYS ENSURE THAT YOU PRACTISE THE RIGHT WAY 
THERE ARE TWELVE OF THESE BUT I'LL GIVE YOU FOUR AT A TIME BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU TO SUFFER FROM INDIGESTION 
DURING THE COURSE OF THIS SESSION 
NUMBER ONE 
SEEK OUT PRIVATE INSTRUCTION 
THAT MEANS TRY TO FIND SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING 
FOR EXAMPLE YO YO IS THE GREATEST CELLIST IN THE WORLD HE'S APPLAUDED EVERYWHERE HE GOES 
BUT STILL YOU HEARD HIM SAY MAN COULD YOU SHOW ME SOMETHING ABOUT MOOD INDIGO 
I LIKE TO LEARN THINGS HE WILL SEEK OUT ADVICE HE'S NOT TOO PROUD 
HE COMES TO ME HE SAYS CAN YOU SHOW ME HOW TO PLAY THIS PIECE OF JAZZ MUSIC 
DON'T BE TOO PROUD TO ASK FOR HELP 
NUMBER TWO 
WRITE OUT A SCHEDULE TO PRACTISE ALL FUNDAMENTALS OF YOUR INSTRUMENT EVERY DAY 
A SCHEDULE IS LIKE A BLUEPRINT FOR BUILDING A HOUSE 
OR SOME INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING A TOY PLANE 
HAVE ANY OF YOU BUILT TOY MODELS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
YOU NEED SOME INSTRUCTIONS THAT'S WHAT YOUR SCHEDULE IS LIKE IT LETS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO 
YOU CAN SEE THERE'S SOMETHING TANGIBLE 
YOU CAN SEE AND IT LETS YOU KNOW 
WITH A TRUMPET THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL THING IS WHAT BREATHING 
I HEAR TRUMPET PLAYERS AND SAY WHAT DO YOU WANT TO PLAY 
THEY SAY SHORT NOTE 
WELL THE CAR CANNOT RUN WITHOUT GAS 
SO I SAY NO TAKE A DEEP DEEP BREATH 
LIKE YOU'RE SWIMMING AND YOU GO UNDER AND YOU COME UP AND YOU TAKE A BIG GULP SO YOU SAY 
THE SAME THING HAPPENS ON THE CELLO 
I DON'T PLAY THE NOTE JUST LIKE THIS SHORT NOTE 
YOU USE YOUR BODY TO ACTUALLY PREPARE 
AND THE OTHER THING I WAS TAUGHT 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH THAT 
IS THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER MAKE A SOUND UNLESS YOU HEAR IT FIRST M. M. M. 
SO YOU'RE NOT JUST DOING THIS 
YOU SEE THAT'S LIKE TALKING WITHOUT THINKING 
SOMETIMES YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH AND YOU GO 
I WISH I HADN'T SAID THAT 
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID I'M GUILTY OF THAT TOO 
O. K. 
NUMBER THREE SET GOALS TO CHART YOUR DEVELOPMENT 
IT'S IMPORTANT LIKE YOU DON'T WANT TO GET THE BLUEPRINT TO YOUR HOUSE 
AND SOMEBODY SAYS BUILD ME A HOUSE 
AND YOU SAY I'LL BUILD THIS HOUSE IN A WEEK THAT'S UNREALISTIC YOU WON'T BUILD IT IN A WEEK 
SO YOU HAVE A CHART FOR YOUR GOALS O. K. 
I WANT THE FOUNDATION DOWN IN A MONTH I WANT THE WALLS UP IN TWO 
AND SO ON SIX MONTHS LATER YOU WANT A HOUSE 
WHEN YOU WANT TO GET BETTER AND YOU PRACTISE YOU SET GOALS 
SO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'LL BE AT A CERTAIN TIME 
NUMBER FOUR CONCENTRATE WHEN PRACTISING 
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE MATHS HOMEWORK 
OR SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT TO DO AND YOU JUST SIT AND YOU GO OH 
YOU WASTE ONE HOUR WHEN YOU COULD HAVE GOT THE WORK DONE IN FIVE OR TEN MINUTES 
USE THE TIME OF PRACTISING TO FOCUS AND CONCENTRATE 
IF YOU CAN'T CONCENTRATE DON'T GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS JUST STOP 
AND COME BACK TO IT 
SOMETHING ISN'T QUITE RIGHT 
MY MIND IS SOME PLACE ELSE OR I'M NOT WELL OR MY BODY'S NOT WELL 
PRACTISING IF YOU PUT YOUR FEELINGS INTO IT 
YOU ACTUALLY JOIN YOUR FEELINGS 
AND YOUR MIND AND YOUR BODY ALL INTO ONE THING 
AND I ALWAYS FEEL BETTER FROM HAVING DONE REALLY GOOD WORK 
DO YOU ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S SAYING 
TRY TO GET ALL OF YOURSELF INTO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO 
IT'S TIME FOR US TO WORK ON SOME MORE OF OUR MOOD INDIGO 
YO YO'S GOING TO PLAY A BIT OF IT 
YEAH LISTEN BEFORE I PLAY ANYTHING I WANT YOU TO HELP ME WITH SOMETHING 
YOU KNOW THIS IN HERE 
YOU KNOW I'M THINKING DOWN BOW UP BOW 
IT'S GOT TO HAVE THE FEELING OF A LOPE OR A WALK DM DM DM 
PEDESTRIAN CELLO 
NOW I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT RIGHT 
WHAT'S WRONG IS IT'S TOO SQUARE IT'S LIKE 
DONK TI DONK TI DONK TI DONK LIKE RIDING A HORSE THAT'S JUMPING YEAH YOU WANT TO SHOW ME AGAIN 
DOH DE DOH DE DOH DE DOH 
YOU'RE MORE LAID BACK THAN I AM I'M GOING 
YOU KNOW BUT THAT'S NOT RIGHT EITHER 
IT'S JUST THE ACCENT IT TAKES TIME LIKE YOU SAY YOU HEAR IT LIKE 
YEAH 
GREAT THAT'S WONDERFUL 
MAYBE IF I'M REALLY GOOD I CAN GET IT IN TWO YEARS 
NOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR MR. MARK INOUYE WHO IS A STUDENT AT THE TANGLEWOOD MUSIC CENTER 
HE'LL PLAY THE THIRD MOVEMENT OF THE TRUMPET CONCERTO BY JOHANN HUMMEL 
HE'S ACCOMPANIED BY MR. MELVIN CHAN ON PIANO 
THIS PIECE THAT MARK IS GOING TO PLAY

IT'S HARD AS YOU HAVE TO DOUBLE TONGUE WHICH IS T. K. A T. K. A T. K. A T. A. A. 
TRUMPET CONCERTO IN E. FLAT BY JOHANN HUMMEL 
AS YOU CAN HEAR THAT'S A VERY DIFFICULT PIECE TO PLAY WITH ALL THAT DOUBLE TONGUING 
AND TRILLING AND EVERYTHING MARK'S GOING TO ASSIST ME IN UNVEILING SOME MORE OF MY WAYS TO PRACTISE 
AND PRACTISE SLOWLY YOU CAN'T BE IN A HURRY IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET BETTER 
A LOT OF TIMES WE WANT TO RUSH IT YOU TRY AND EXPLAIN TO A STUDENT HOW YOU WANT THEM TO PLAY SOMETHING 
TAKE YOUR TIME TAKE YOUR TIME 
NOW HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO PRACTISE SLOWLY 
HUMMEL'S CONCERTO A. T. HALF SPEED 
SO YOU CAN SEE IT CAN BE KIND OF BORING PLAYING MUSIC AT THAT KIND OF TEMPO 
BUT THAT'S PART OF PRACTISING YOU HAVE TO KEEP WORKING ON IT 
WHEN YOU GET IT AT THAT SLOW TEMPO EVERY DAY EVERY WEEK YOU WORK ON IT AND PLAY IT FASTER AND FASTER 
NOW WE GET TO NUMBER SIX YOU HAVE TO PRACTISE LONGER ON THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T PLAY 
YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO SHOW OFF YOU WANT EVERYBODY TO BE PROUD OF YOU SO NATURALLY 
YOU WANT TO PLAY WHATEVER YOU CAN PLAY 
GENERALLY THAT WOULD BE THE EASIER THINGS 
WHEN YOU GET TO A HARD PART THAT'S WHEN YOU HAVE TO BUCKLE DOWN AND CONCENTRATE AND DEDICATE YOURSELF 
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF A VERY VERY DIFFICULT PASSAGE IN THE HUMMEL 
AND UM IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS 
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PRACTISE HOUR AFTER HOUR 
IT'S LIKE IN BASKETBALL PEOPLE GET OUT ON THE COURT AND THEY DO ALL KINDS OF FANCY DUNKS AND THINGS 
BUT THEY GO TO THE FREE THROW LINE AND THEY CAN'T MAKE THE FREE THROW 
THEY DIDN'T PRACTISE ON WHAT THEY COULDN'T DO 
SO DON'T FORGET THAT 
NUMBER SEVEN PLAY EVERYTHING AS IF YOU WERE SINGING 
MAKE EVERYTHING SOUND MUSICAL NO MATTER HOW APPARENTLY UNIMPORTANT 
ALWAYS PLAY WITH THE MAXIMUM OF EXPRESSION 
GIVE YOURSELF OVER TO THE MUSIC ALL THE TIME 
EVERY DAY YOU WALK AROUND MAKING YOURSELF INTO YOU 
SO DON'T BE 
SIT UP AND DO EVERYTHING WITH THE PROPER TYPE OF ATTITUDE 
BE INTERESTED BE INTERESTING 
ALWAYS INVEST YOURSELF AND PARTICIPATE 
WHEN YOU WARM UP YOU'RE SERIOUS WHEN YOU PLAY A PIECE OR PRACTISE YOU'RE SERIOUS 
YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD TIME YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THE FUN OF BEING SERIOUS 
WHEN YOU'RE NOT PLAYING A PIECE OF MUSIC LIKE WHEN YOU'RE WARMING UP HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT EXPRESSIVE 
EVERYTHING IS A PIECE OF MUSIC 
EVERY TIME YOU TOUCH YOUR HORN YOU'RE PLAYING MUSIC 
SO WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT IS A WARM UP ON THE TRUMPET 
NOW EARLIER YOU ALL WERE ASKING ME TO PLAY TAPS 
WELL THIS SOUNDS LIKE TAPS THIS IS TAPS 
THE LAST POST 
SO YOU SEE SOMETHING MIGHT SEEM LIKE IT'S NOT IMPORTANT BUT IT IS BECAUSE IT'S ALL A PART OF YOU 
THE WAY YOU TIE YOUR SHOES THE WAY YOU HOLD YOUR FORK 
ALWAYS TRY TO BE YOURSELF AND GIVE YOURSELF TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
DON'T BE A CYNIC A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE TOO HIP TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING 
DON'T BE LIKE THAT INVEST YOURSELF IN A THING 
NOW NUMBER EIGHT DON'T BE TOO HARD ON YOURSELF 
IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE 
IF YOU MESS UP IN A CONCERT IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD 
IT'S LIKE DROPPING THE TOUCHDOWN PASS IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
EVERYBODY'S LOOKING AT YOU FRIENDS UP IN THE STANDS 
BMPH YOU COME BACK TO THE PITCH AND THE WHOLE TEAM IS 
DON'T FEEL THAT BAD IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD 
YOU LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES YOU INCORPORATE IT INTO YOUR EXPERIENCE AND KEEP GOING 
A LARGE PORTION OF YOUR MUSICAL LIFE WILL BE SPENT IN GROUP PRACTICE 
MOST OF YOUR GREATEST MOMENTS IN MUSIC 
ARE THE RESULT OF A GROUP EFFORT 
WELL ACTUALLY THE SAME THING IS TRUE OUTSIDE OF MUSIC 
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD SOMEONE RECEIVING AN AWARD SAY 
THE PEOPLE I WANT TO THANK ARE JUST TOO NUMEROUS TO MENTION IT WAS TRULY A GROUP EFFORT 
I'M ALWAYS FASCINATED BY GROUPS 
IT'S LIKE A CONGREGATION IN A CHURCH 
YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT HEAR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE SAYING THE SAME PRAYER 
THEY START TOGETHER AND THEN SOMEWHERE IN THE BEGINNING 
THEY FIND A GROUP RHYTHM AND THEY END TOGETHER 
THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF WHAT GROUP ACTIVITY'S ALL ABOUT 
YOU START KIND OF SEPARATE 
BUT YOU GET IT TOGETHER AND IT ENDS TOGETHER 
THAT MAKES GROUP PLAYING AND GROUP LIVING SUCCESSFUL 
CHORALE NO THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE BY JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH 
THAT WAS BACH'S CHORALE NUMBER THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE 
PLAYED BY YO YO AND A GROUP OF THREE STUDENTS HE HAS ASSEMBLED 
KARI DOCTER JULIAN HERSH AND JENNIFER MORSCHES FROM THE TANGLEWOOD MUSIC CENTER 
NOW WHEN WE THINK ABOUT STRINGS WE USUALLY THINK OF SOFT MUSIC 
OH STRINGS THEY'RE SO SOFT AND PRETTY 
BUT FROM HAVING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR YO YO 
HE PLAYS WITH TREMENDOUS INTENSITY AND FIRE 
WE DON'T GET THE CHANCE TO SIT CLOSE ENOUGH TO REALLY 
SO I'VE ASKED HIM TO PLAY SOMETHING FIERY 
THIS PIECE THEY'VE NEVER PLAYED BEFORE AND WE HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE A GROUP OF MUSICIANS WORK ON A PIECE 
THIS IS A MARCH COMPOSED BY PROKOFIEV 
IF HE WANTS FIRE WE'LL GIVE HIM FIRE O. K. 
SO ONE TWO THREE FOUR 
MARCH FROM LOVE FOR THREE ORANGES BY SERGEI PROKOFIEV 
SO 
WE TALKED YESTERDAY WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING WITH ME 
THAT BOWING DO THAT THERE JUST YEAH 
CAN YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE MACHINE GUN FIRE 
ALMOST 
ALMOST UGLY AND PLAY CLOSE TO THE BRIDGE 
BOUNCE IT YES 
YEAH THAT'S GOOD 
GOOD 
DON'T WORRY WE'RE NOT HERE TO PLAY PERFECTLY JUST TO GET CHARACTER O. K. 
JENNIFER YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL WHEN YOU GO 
THE REST IS A SLAP IN THE FACE IT'S LIKE YOU WANT TO GO ON AND SOMETHING GOES 
NOT BOP 
B. A. B. A. B. A. BAA DAA MMMPH 
WHAT I HEAR FROM YOU YOU GO D. A. D. A. D. A. DAA DAA 
BOP IT SOUNDS LIKE A NICE PHRASE I ALLOW IT TO COME OUT SO 
GO AHEAD 
OW 
HMM BUM BUM GOOD WAIT 
AND THEN THE SAME THING 
SO LET'S TRY THIRTY THREE AGAIN AND REALLY DON'T GIVE UP ALL RIGHT THREE FOUR 
GOOD 
KARI IT'S FABULOUS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU PLAY IT ONE MORE TIME 
ALL RIGHT 
YOU'RE MAKING IT EXPLODE TOO SOON 
SO SUPPRESS IT ALL OF THAT GREAT THING 
JUST PUT A LID OVER IT DON'T TAKE AWAY ANY OF THE ENERGY JUST PUT A LID OVER IT LET'S TRY IT AGAIN O. K. 
THREE FOUR 
YES DO YOU HEAR IT 
IT SOUNDS BETTER HUH 
O. K. 
NOW I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING YOU GUYS HAVEN'T REALLY PLAYED TOGETHER RIGHT 
MUCH AT ALL NO EXCEPT IN ORCHESTRA 
SO WE MET FOR THE FIRST TIME YESTERDAY 
AND UM WAS IT EASY TO COME TOGETHER 
YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE DISAGREEMENTS AND THAT'S PART OF THE WHOLE PROCESS 
YOU FIND A WAY TO DEAL WITH THEM M. M. M. BUT YOU ALSO TAKE IDEAS 
AND TRY TO MAKE THE BEST PERFORMANCE POSSIBLE 
JENNIFER IT MAY BE AN EMBARRASSING QUESTION BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN A GROUP AND YOU'RE PLAYING WITH SOMEBODY 
YOU REALLY REALLY CAN'T STAND WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT IT 
DO YOU LEAVE DO YOU STAY WHAT HAPPENS 
NO I THINK I'VE LEARNED TO TRY TO PUT MYSELF IN THAT PERSON'S SHOES 
JUST TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM 
BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I'M DOING OR THINKING 
RESPECT EACH OTHER'S INDIVIDUALITY 
BECAUSE EACH PERSON IS GOING TO HAVE IDEAS THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE WHOLE 
JUST REALLY TRUST IS VERY IMPORTANT IN A GROUP 
AND MAY NOT BE SOMEONE YOU'RE GOING TO BE VERY CLOSE TO 
BUT UM I GUESS IF YOU HAVE A COMMON GOAL 
BRINGS YOU TOGETHER AND WE'RE HERE TO SERVE MUSIC IN A WAY 
YOU REALLY WANT THE MUSIC TO LIVE AND TO MAKE IT SING OUT 
WELL SHALL WE TRY IT AGAIN 
SHALL WE ACTUALLY NOW PERFORM THIS INCREDIBLY WELL REHEARSED MARCH 
LET'S TRY IT O. K. 
THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF PLAYING ANY INSTRUMENT IS SOUND 
WE SPEAK OF THE SUPREMACY OF TONE 
BECAUSE THE SOUND OF YOUR INSTRUMENT IS YOUR MUSICAL IDENTITY 
IT'S JUST LIKE YOUR VOICE 
NOW TONES CAN BE OPEN OR CLOSED 
HAPPY OR SAD BIG OR SMALL 
FIRST YOU'VE THE SOUND OF YOUR INSTRUMENT 
LIKE THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET 
AND THEN YOUR PERSONAL SOUND ON THE INSTRUMENT 
NOT JUST THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET BUT WYNTON'S SOUND OR EDDIE'S SOUND 
OR WHOEVER'S SOUND IT'S GOING TO BE 
WHEN YOU ARE PRACTISING FOR YOUR SOUND 
FIRST YOU WANT TO GET JUST A GOOD SOUND ON THE INSTRUMENT 
THEN YOU WANT TO PROJECT YOUR PERSONALITY THROUGH THE SOUND 
NOW THE POWER OF SOUND IS SOMETHING LIKE 
KNOWING WHEN TO TALK AND WHEN TO BE QUIET 
WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING MUSIC YOU'RE ALWAYS PLAYING WITH OTHER PEOPLE 
AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHEN YOUR SOUND IS NEEDED 
WHEN TO PLAY IN THE HIGH REGISTER WHEN TO PLAY IN THE LOW WHEN TO PLAY SOFT WHEN TO PLAY LOUD 
NOW TO HELP US FURTHER DISCUSS SOUND 
WE HAVE MR. BEN WOLFE ON THE BASS 
MR. ERIC REED ON PIANO MR. HERLIN RILEY ON DRUMS 
AND WE HAVE YOUNG MR. RANDALL HAYWOOD WHO'S FOURTEEN YEARS OLD 
AND HE'S GOING TO PLAY RIGHT NOW A CHORUS OF SOME MINOR BLUES FOR US 
ONE TWO UH 
UH UH UH 
NOW WHAT I WANT HIM TO TRY TO DO 
RANDALL WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS 
I WANT YOU TO TRY AND PLAY NOW BUT PLAY SOFTER 
A LOT OF TIMES WHEN WE'RE PLAYING WE PLAY TOO LOUD 
WHEN YOU PLAY TOO LOUDLY YOUR SOUND CUTS OFF ON YOU 
NOW THAT WAS A GOOD CHORUS YOU'VE JUST PLAYED 
I WANT YOU TO FEEL HOW YOUR SOUND RESONATES WHEN YOU RELAX AND ALLOW YOUR PERSONALITY TO COME THROUGH 
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU'RE IN AN ARGUMENT WITH SOMEBODY SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER TO WHISPER WHEN YOU REALLY GET MAD 
YOU SAY MAN DIDN'T I TELL YOU NOT TO TELL ME THAT 
AND THE PERSON HAS TO COME CLOSER TO YOU 
IN MUSIC THE ABILITY TO PLAY SOFTER ALLOWS YOU TO RELAX 
COS NOWADAYS MUSIC IS JUST TOO LOUD A LOT OF THE TIME IT IT'S VIOLENT ALMOST 
SO I WANT YOU TO TRY THE SAME CHORUS JUST IN A SOFTER VOLUME ONE TWO A ONE TWO UH UH 
NOW ANOTHER THING IS IN JAZZ SOLO 
YOU PRESENT IDEAS LIKE ON A CHORUS OF BLUES YOU WANT TO DEVELOP THE IDEAS 
LIKE TALKING IF YOU'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION 
YOU DON'T WANT TO JUMP ALL OVER THE PLACE AND JAZZ MUSIC IS THE SAME 
YOU GET A THEME AND WHEN YOU GET THAT THEME MILK IT 
TURN IT AROUND TWIST IT PLAY IT IN DIFFERENT KEYS 
SO I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME A THEME AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE JUST PLAY ANYTHING FOR ME 
THAT'S A LONG THEME BUT I'M GOING TO DO WHAT I CAN WITH IT 
UN UN UN UN UN UN 
A 
YOU SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT YEAH 
ANOTHER GOOD THING TO WORK ON IN YOUR SOUND IS SPECIAL EFFECTS 
THAT'S LIKE LITTLE THINGS YOU HAVE IN YOUR VOICE 
LIKE WHEN YOU WANT SOMETHING AND YOU LEARN HOW TO SAY PLEASE A CERTAIN WAY 
IN MUSIC WE DO THAT WITH HALF VALVES OUR GROWLS AND SMEARS 
OUR DECLARITIVE STATEMENTS 
SO UM I WANT YOU TO SHOW ME SOME DIFFERENT EFFECTS THAT YOU CAN PLAY 
THAT'S GOOD WHAT HE'S DOING WHEN YOU PLAY NOTES LIKE 
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO GROWL NO SIR 
I'M GOING TO SHOW HIM HOW TO GROWL TO GROWL YOU HUM 
YOU GO HMM AND HRRRMMM AT THE SAME TIME 
IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS 
HMM 
O. K. I WANT YOU TO TRY THAT ONE TWO A UH UH UH 
ALL RIGHT I WANT YOU TO HUM SAY HMM MMM 
NOW GO PFVVV PLAY WHILE YOU DO THAT 
UH HUH PLAY IT OUT HRRMMM 
WELL YOU'LL GET THAT EVENTUALLY THAT'S PART OF PRACTISING TOO YOU GET THINGS AND WORK ON THEM 
YOU CAN SEE YO YO WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 
AND I THINK THESE EFFECTS CAN HELP US WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO PLAY OUR MOOD INDIGO 
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NOW 
IS IN THE STYLE OF THE JAZZ MUSICIANS WE LISTEN AND IMITATE WHAT WE HEAR 
AND THAT'S GOOD FOR JUST DEVELOPING OUR SOUNDS 
WHEN YOU LISTEN TO GOOD SOUNDS THEN YOU'RE ABLE TO DEVELOP A GOOD SOUND 
IT'S JUST LIKE TRYING TO LEARN A LANGUAGE 
IF YOU LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO SPEAK THAT LANGUAGE IT WILL TEACH YOU TO SPEAK IT PROPERLY 
WHAT I WANT US TO DO IF WE SET UP A CALL AND RESPONSE DIALOGUE 
I'M GOING TO PLAY DIFFERENT EFFECTS AND YOU IMITATE ME O. K. HERE WE GO 
A ONE TWO A ONE NN NN NA 
SHORT BARKS 
SHORTER BARKS 
COOL MELODIC RIFF 
THERE IT IS 
SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO LISTEN TO MR. RANDALL HAYWOOD 
HE'S GOING TO PLAY A CHARLIE PARKER COMPOSITION 
ENTITLED THE COOL BLUES 
THE COOL BLUES 
NOW HERE ARE MY FINAL FOUR WAYS TO PRACTISE 
NUMBER NINE 
DON'T SHOW OFF 
FIRST BECAUSE NOBODY WILL LIKE YOU 
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL I WOULD ALWAYS PLAY GIGS 
I WOULD DO THIS THING CALLED CIRCULAR BREATHING 
YOU BREATHE IN THROUGH YOUR NOSE WHILE YOU BREATHE OUT THROUGH YOUR MOUTH 
WITH IT YOU CAN PLAY FOR TEN MINUTES WITHOUT STOPPING 
FLIGHT OF THE BUMBLEBEE 
SO ANYWAY I COULD DO THIS ALL NIGHT 
EVERY TIME I WOULD HAVE A SOLO I WOULD DO THIS 
MY FATHER WHO WAS A JAZZ PIANIST TOLD ME SON THOSE WHO PLAY FOR APPLAUSE THAT'S ALL THEY GET 
SO THAT WAS A GREAT LESSON FOR ME BECAUSE I WOULD SACRIFICE THE MUSIC 
JUST TO SHOW OFF BECAUSE I KNEW THE AUDIENCE WOULD CLAP FOR IT 
WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING YOU DON'T WANT TO SHOW OFF 
YOU WANT TO ALWAYS PLAY MUSIC 
THAT'S THE WAY YOU CAN GROW AND DEVELOP YOU HAVE TO FIND A BALANCE 
NUMBER TEN THINK FOR YOURSELF 
METHODS ARE JUST WAYS TO DO SOMETHING THAT WORK FOR MOST PEOPLE 
YOU MIGHT THINK OF A DIFFERENT WAY THAT WOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU 
IT'S LIKE IF YOU LOOK AT THE OLYMPICS OR ANY TRACK AND FIELD COMPETITION WATCH THE HIGH JUMP 
THEY DO THIS THING CALLED THE FOSBURY FLOP WHERE THEY RUN THEY TURN ROUND AND THEY JUMP BACKWARDS 
NOW FOR MANY YEARS EVERYBODY JUMPED OVER THE BAR THIS WAY 
BUT THIS GUY FOSBURY FIGURED HE WOULD JUMP BACKWARDS 
OF COURSE EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT HIM BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T USED TO THAT BUT NOW EVERYBODY JUMPS THAT WAY 
SO YOU DON'T WANT TO BECOME A ROBOT 
IF YOUR TEACHER TELLS YOU SOMETHING 
WORK ON IT BUT THINK BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE A WAY TO DO IT THAT'S BETTER FOR YOU 
ON THE OTHER HAND DON'T DISMISS WHAT YOU'RE TAUGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO LAZY TO PRACTISE 
IT'S LIKE THOSE FREE THROWS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT OR TOO PROUD 
NUMBER ELEVEN 
BE OPTIMISTIC 
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT LIVING IN THE WORLD IS WHO YOU ARE 
WHEN YOU'RE OPTIMISTIC THE WORLD IS ALWAYS WONDERFUL OR BECOMING WONDERFUL 
WHEN YOU'RE PESSIMISTIC YOU HAVE A BAD TIME 
AND THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN PESSIMISM COMING THROUGH A HORN 
IT'S LIKE THE GREAT ART BLAKEY ALWAYS SAID 
HE'S A VERY GREAT JAZZ DRUMMER 
MUSIC WASHES AWAY THE DUST OF EVERYDAY LIFE FROM YOUR FEET 
SO WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE TO DO NOBODY WANTS TO BE AROUND SOMEBODY COMPLAINING ALL THE TIME 
YOU HAVE TO THINK LIKE THE BLUES YES THINGS ARE BAD 
BUT THEY'LL GET BETTER THAT'S RIGHT 
NOW MY FINAL ONE NUMBER TWELVE 
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THROUGHOUT ALL OF THESE SESSIONS 
LOOK FOR CONNECTIONS TO OTHER THINGS 
NO MATTER WHAT YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING IS RELATED 
WE TALKED ABOUT HOUSE BUILDING FREE THROWS CONCENTRATING GETTING ALONG IN A GROUP 
AND ONE DAY WHEN YOU GET MARRIED YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS BELIEVE ME 
NOW YO YO AND I ARE GOING TO LOOK FOR A CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT I DO AND WHAT HE DOES 
IN THIS PERFORMANCE OF MOOD INDIGO AND WE CERTAINLY HOPE THAT YOU ALL ENJOY THIS THANK YOU 
FIDDLE BOW REAL BY WYNTON MARSALIS 
THE BLACK BOTTOM 
THE BLACK BOTTOM IS A TRADITIONAL DANCE 
AND WE'VE MODERNISED IT AND ADDED BITS TO IT 
INSTEAD OF US HAVING PEOPLE ACTUALLY TEACHING US 
IT'S MORE OF US COPYING OLDER DANCES 
IF I DON'T FEEL THAT I'VE DONE A PERFORMANCE WELL 
THE CLAPS AND CHEERS MEAN NOTHING 
BUT IF WE'VE ALL WORKED TOGETHER IT FEELS GREAT 
IT JUST FEELS BETTER THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD 
YOU GET LIKE A BUZZ DOING IT IT FEELS GOOD 
YOU DO FEEL REALLY PROUD AND CONFIDENT 
BIRMINGHAM YO PEOPLE OF BIRMINGHAM 
I CAN RAP 
I CAN FEEL LIKE THAT BECAUSE I'M INTO HIP HOP AND MUSIC IS MY LIFE 
TEN NINE EIGHT SEVEN SIX FIVE FOUR 
AT LEAST I'M DOING SOMETHING FOR AN ASIAN GIRL 
SOMETIMES I GET MUDDLED UP BUT I DON'T THINK ABOUT WHAT I'M PLAYING 
BECAUSE IF YOU THINK TOO MUCH WHILE YOU'RE PLAYING 
IT REALLY MESSES YOU UP SOMETIMES 
JUST THINK POSITIVE AND JUST PLAY 
I ENJOY PLAYING AND WANT TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT IN THE FUTURE 
WHEN YOU PERFORM YOU JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO 
YOU'RE CONCENTRATING SO HARD THAT EVERYONE ELSE 
YOU COMPLETELY IGNORE THEM PRETEND THEY'RE NOT THERE AND JUST THINK IT'S A REHEARSAL 
BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS TO CONCENTRATE SO HARD ON WHAT THEY HAVE TO PLAY 
PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE NOT ENJOYING IT BUT THEY ACTUALLY ARE 
I LIVE IN NUNTHORPE MIDDLESBROUGH AND I PLAY THE SAXOPHONE 
AND I PLAY THE PAN PIPES AND PLAY THE DI 
OUR TEACHER HAS A SISTER IN CHINA 
AND HE GOES OVER ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR 
AND OVER THE YEARS HE'S COLLECTED INSTRUMENTS 
THE MAIN ONE IS THE YANGQIN THAT'S WHAT THE GROUP'S NAMED AFTER 
I PRACTISE WHEN I CAN WHEN NOT DOING THAT 
I'M DOING MY HOMEWORK IF NOT HOMEWORK I'M PRACTISING 
PEOPLE ARE UPSET WHEN I SAY I'M THE DRUMMER THEY THINK I'M THE SINGER 
I REALLY LIKE THE STYLE OF MUSIC I LIKE THE JAZZY FUNK ELEMENT TO IT 
WHEN I'M PLAYING I'M MORE ANIMATED I SUPPOSE 
I SPEND LIKE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED HOURS OF MY WEEK SITTING IN MY ROOM AT MY COMPUTER MAKING MUSIC 
WE'VE ALL MET THROUGH SCHOOL 
MY MUSIC TEACHER'S VERY IMPORTANT 
WITHOUT HER I DOUBT WE'D ALL BE TOGETHER 
IT'S A CHANCE FOR A LOT OF THE PLAYERS TO REALLY SHOW OFF 
AND SHOW WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH MUSIC 
THERE'S NOT MUCH MUSICAL HISTORY IN MY FAMILY 
BUT SINCE I TOOK UP INSTRUMENTS THEY'VE SLIPPED IN BEHIND ME 
IT'S HARD TO GET A DOUBLE BASS TO GIGS ON YOUR OWN
