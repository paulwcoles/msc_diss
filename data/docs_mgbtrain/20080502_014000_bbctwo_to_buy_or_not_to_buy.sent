SOMEWHERE TO PARK THE CAR NOT ON THE ROAD PREFERABLY 
RIGHT O. K.

A GARDEN ALTHOUGH NOT TOO BIG 
OTHER THAN THAT I THINK WE'RE QUITE OPEN MINDED

SO EPPING IN THE FINE COUNTY OF ESSEX AND IF LEGEND OR IAN IS TO BE BELIEVED A FAVOURITE HAUNT 
FOR FAMOUS HIGHWAYMAN DICK TURPIN

STRETCHING FOR TWELVE MILES AND COVERING SIX THOUSAND ACRES 
IT'S IDEALLY PLACED FOR CENTRAL LONDON AND IT'S ONLY FORTY MILES FROM CAMBRIDGE 
BUT BEING SO CLOSE TO THE CAPITAL HAS ITS DRAWBACKS MAINLY ON THE MONEY FRONT

AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE BEAMS I THINK IT MAKES IT COSY HOMELY 
THERE'S SOME CHARACTER THERE THERE IS 
NICE DINING ROOM OH VERY GOOD AND THE STUFF 
SHE WANTED A SEPARATE DINING ROOM AND THAT'S WHAT SHE'S GOT 
THIS USED TO BE THE GARAGE 
AND THEY'VE GOT THAT THIS ISN'T THIS IS WHERE THE GARAGE WAS OH 
SO IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A GARAGE IT'S A ROOM THAT'S CLEVER 
AH SHE'S SPOTTED IT 
EXACTLY IN THE FRONT BIT IT'S STILL GOT STORAGE YEAH 
AND YOU'VE GOT THAT ALUMINATED 
ALUMINATED WELL THEY'RE SORT OF MADE FROM IS IT MADE FROM ALUMINIUM 
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE DINING ROOM 
IT'S GOOD USE OF SPACE IF YOU DON'T NEED A GARAGE WHICH SHE DOESN'T 
OH 
THAT'S IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S WORKABLE IT'S IT'S 
IT'S NOT HUGE IT'S DEFINITELY WE'D GET USED TO IT THE TWO OF US 
CONSIDERING THAT I DON'T COOK ANYWAY

COSY YOU COULD SIT DOWN AND RELAX IN IT 
IT JUST FEELS QUITE NICE O. K. JUST SIT DOWN IN THAT ONE 
IT IS A COSY LITTLE HOUSE 
AND IT'S GOT A FEEL GOOD FACTOR 
NOT A LOVER OF THE FIREPLACE I MUST ADMIT NO BUT IT'S QUITE IN CHARACTER 
BUT PERHAPS YEAH NO I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE TO GO 
OPEN FIRE I THINK THAT'S A CHIMNEY BRICK 
DON'T KNOW YOU'LL HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT 
HAVE TO LOOK UP AND SEE IF THERE'S A CHIMNEY POT IF IT CARRIES ON 
I THINK IT IS IT'S BEEN A REAL FIRE LOOK 
SHE SPOTTED IT'S BEEN A REAL FIRE BEFORE GOOD GIRL CAROL 
SIT HERE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK M. M. M. YEAH IT'S NICE TO LOOK AT THAT ISN'T IT 
YEAH LITTLE BIT OF INTEREST AND GOOD FOCAL POINT AT THAT END 
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN THEY'RE SNUGGLING UP ON THE SOFA MAKING THEMSELVES AT HOME 
THIS MUST BE THE THE LITTLE ROOM IT'S YOUR ROOM A LITTLE GIRL'S ROOM 
I'M NOT QUITE THAT SMALL THINK WE'VE GONE PAST THE PINK STAGE 
SEWING ROOM OH YEAH DEFINITELY MAKE A MESS IN HERE AND THEN LEAVE IT 
SHE DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS A SEWER 
OH THIS IS NICE OH 
THE ONLY PROBLEM HERE IS WHO'S GOING TO HAVE THE BIGGEST BEDROOM 
THIS COULD BE MY ROOM I THINK 
NO THE WARDROBE SPACE I THINK IT'S MY ROOM OOH 
I LIKE THAT I'LL FIGHT YOU FOR IT 
IT'S QUITE ME I THINK JENNY'S DONE QUITE WELL WITH THIS ONE 
DO YOU RECKON YEAH SO FAR SO GOOD 
DID YOU HEAR THAT WHAT DID SHE SAY 
SHE SAID JENNY'S DONE QUITE WELL 
M. M. M. LITTLE BIT ON THE SMALL SIDE I THINK 
EVERYTHING YOU NEED THOUGH IT'S ALL NICE 
YEAH IT'S O. K. YEAH YEAH IT'S FINE WE'D MANAGE 
WHEN YOU FIND YOUR DREAM HOUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST MANAGE 
THE SECOND BIG BEDROOM I WOULD SAY AH WOULD YOU GET A DOUBLE IN HERE 
YEAH AT A PUSH 
I THINK YOU WOULD IT'S NOT AS GREAT AS THE OTHER ONE SPACE WISE 
SO THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU FIT A DOUBLE IN THAT ROOM 
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE REALLY HANDY FOR JANE 
TELL YOU WHAT I'LL HAVE THE KING SIZE IN THERE AND YOU CAN HAVE THE QUEEN SIZE IN HERE 
THIS MIGHT BE A BIT SMALL FOR ME SO WE'LL FIGHT FOR THE MASTER BEDROOM AH YEAH 
THERE'S ALWAYS A KING AND A QUEEN 
BUT WE'RE THE KIND AND QUEEN OF TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
ANOTHER SINGLE ROOM 
OOH MIGHT GET WARDROBES 
YEAH LOTS OF WARDROBES AGAIN THAT'S MY SPARE ONES 
YEAH THAT COULD BE THE COMPROMISE YOU CAN HAVE THE SMALLER BEDROOM AND THE BIG WARDROBES 
AND YOUR OWN LITTLE CHAIR DESK OH MAKE A NICE LITTLE SITTING ROOM 
YEAH THE GUEST ROOM'S GONE OUT THE WINDOW THEN SO NOBODY CAN COME AND STAY WITH US UNLUCKY 
CAROL AND HER LOVELY DAUGHTER HAVE GOT SO MANY IDEAS YOU CAN HARDLY KEEP UP WITH THEM I KNOW 
I KNOW WE ARE THEY'RE IN ONE ROOM THEN THEY'RE IN ANOTHER ROOM 
CONVERTING THAT INTO A WARDROBE 
IF WE PUT A SOFA BED IN THERE YEAH AND A LITTLE T. V. PLAYSTATION 
GUEST ROOM YOUR LITTLE LIVING QUARTERS 
OH YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA I THINK I GOT THE BEST BIT THOUGH 
I JUST TALKED MYSELF OUT OF THE BIG BEDROOM 
LISTEN IAN YES JENNY 
WE STILL HAVE OUR USES EVEN IF THESE TWO GIRLS DON'T REALLY NEED US BECAUSE THEY'RE SO WITH IT 
WHAT'S THAT THEN WHAT DO THEY NEED US FOR GUESS THE PRICE OH 
NOW GIRLS I'M FEELING QUITE HAPPY WITH MYSELF BECAUSE AS FAR AS I KNOW FROM LISTENING OUTSIDE 
YOU QUITE LIKE THIS PLACE 
WE DO YEAH YEAH QUITE IMPRESSED 
YES AND THE DEVELOPMENT AS A WHOLE THAT'S LOVELY I THINK IT'S BEEN DONE VERY WELL HASN'T IT 
I REALLY LOVE THE COURTYARD AND THE WHOLE AREA 
AND THAT LOVELY ARCHWAY AS YOU COME IN I KNOW YEAH 
NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THE YEAR OF THE QUEEN'S SILVER JUBILEE 
YES COULD BE A MEMORABLE LOCATION 
THIS DEVELOPMENT WAS VERY WELL DONE BACK IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
AND THE GUY THAT ACTUALLY DID THIS DEVELOPMENT 
DID HAVE IT WRITTEN INTO THE DEEDS THAT IF YOU DID WANT TO CHANGE CERTAIN THINGS M. M. M. 
IT'S NOT SO EASY AS YOU THINK OH 
BUT IN A GOOD WAY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN KEEPING WITH THE OTHER PROPERTIES 
YOU CAN'T JUST GO PUTTING CRAZY WINDOWS IN AND PAINTING THE HOUSE GREEN FOR EXAMPLE 
RIGHT SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY GOOD FOR PEACE OF MIND YEAH 
BECAUSE IT'S SO WELL KEPT ISN'T IT IT IS YEAH IT'S LOVELY IT LOOKS NICE 
WELL MAINTAINED AND EVERYONE LOOKS LIKE THEY RESPECT WHERE THEY LIVE YEAH 
YOU KNOW AND I KNOW YOU'RE QUITE FUSSY AND HUH 
AND YOU WANT EVERYTHING TO BE NEAT AND PRISTINE YEAH 
AND IT'S VERY CLEAN AND VERY QUIET EPPING GREEN 
M. M. M. A FEW MILES FROM EPPING YEAH ARE YOU STILL O. K. WITH THAT THE TUBE AND EVERYTHING 
YEAH I MEAN THE TUBE'S NOT SUCH A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE WOULD DRIVE 
I MEAN WE'D LIKE TO THINK WE'D WALK TO THE SHOPS IF POSSIBLE BUT

I WANT YOU THREE TO GET BACK ON THOSE BIKES THAT ARE RUSTING COS WE'RE HEADING BACK INTO TOWN 
O. K. BACK INTO TOWN FOR PROPERTY NUMBER TWO FOLLOW ME SINGLE FILE 
RIGHT PARK YOUR BIKES OUR SECOND STOP IS INDEED SLAP BANG IN THE MARKET TOWN OF EPPING 
CONVENIENTLY LOCATED WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF THE HIGH STREET 
AND HALF A MILE FROM THE CENTRAL LINE TUBE STATION VERY NICE 
AND AS IF THIS THREE STOREY TOWNHOUSE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM 
TO CREATE EVEN MORE SPACE THE OWNERS HAVE CONVERTED THE GARAGE 
PROPERTY TWO A GEORGIAN STYLE TOWNHOUSE ON THREE LEVELS 
AND FOR ME THIS IS ALL ABOUT SPACE 
WITH YOUR DIY HAT ON RIGHT 
I THINK IT'S GOT THE POTENTIAL TO BE SOMETHING RATHER SPECIAL 
A GREAT PLACE REALLY NICE 
ALL SORTS OF LOVELY LITTLE BOUTIQUES AND I CAN SEE WHAT YOU LIKE LOTS OF CAFES AND RESTAURANTS 
GREAT FOR YOU TO MEET ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND STUFF SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE PROPERTY ITSELF 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD HAVE HAD A LOOK AT O. K. BECAUSE 
I DON'T KNOW IT'S DIFFERENT 
IT'S A NICE PROPERTY JUST NOT THEIR THING 
WHEN WE SAID WHAT DID YOU WANT YOU SAID IT'S LOVELY TO HAVE A BIT OF CHARACTER 
DO YOU THINK IT'S A BIT LACKING IN CHARACTER 
UM I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK DOWN THE CLOSE IT LOOKS QUITE NICE ALL IN A TOWN 
YEAH BUT I DON'T KNOW WELL INSIDE YOU'RE LAUGHING 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT AT BUT I THINK WE'LL FIND OUT 
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU YEAH I THINK THE LOCATION'S BRILLIANT 
I THINK THE ROW LOOKS NICE AND NEAT SHALL WE GET YOU INSIDE YEP 
AND ALL RIGHT WE'LL TALK TO YOU AFTERWARDS O. K. SEE YOU 
OOH IT'S NICE AND MODERN 
OH GOD IT'S QUITE BIG ISN'T IT 
YEAH DECEPTIVE FROM THE OUTSIDE ISN'T IT 
FROM THE OUTSIDE IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MUCH BUT I THINK THEY'RE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED 
IT'S THOSE CRYSTALS IT IS GOOD KARMA IAN GOOD KARMA 
THIS IS ER EMITTING GOOD FEELINGS IS IT 
YEAH CRYSTALS OR SOMETHING THAT'S NICE AGAIN SPOTLIGHTS ISN'T IT 
YEAH I LIKE THAT 
WHAT'S THIS OH THEY'VE DONE THE SAME WITH THE GARAGE AH 
THIS AGAIN SHOULD BE THE INTERNAL GARAGE 
EVERYBODY IS CONVERTING THEIR GARAGE INTO AN EXTRA ROOM 
LITTLE SITTING ROOM HE'S GOT A NICE STUDY HASN'T HE LIBRARY 
IT IS A LITTLE ROOM BUT IT COULD BE USED AS A DINING ROOM IF YOU WANTED TO 
KITCHEN OOH THIS IS QUITE NICE AS WELL QUITE MODERN 
YEAH VERY MODERN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TO THE LAST ONE 
IT'S GOT SPACE IT'S NICE A LOT BIGGER ISN'T IT 
BE INTERESTING TO KNOW WHICH SORT OF CHARACTER AND STYLE THEY'LL GO FOR 
SO THERE'S ONLY THE HALLWAY AND KITCHEN I THINK THAT'S IT 
IS IT AH 
A HA RIGHT EITHER THAT OR YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR FOOD UPSTAIRS 
THERE'S THAT INITIAL OH WHERE'S THE REST OF THE HOUSE COS IT'S ALL UP THERE 
SO REALLY ONCE THEY KNOW THERE'S MORE THINGS UPSTAIRS 
THEY NEED TO MAKE THAT OFFICE SPACE A DINING ROOM 
IT'S VERY SPACIOUS ISN'T IT THE HALLWAYS AND WHATEVER 
NOT AS NARROW AS YOU THOUGHT BEDROOM DO YOU THINK 
THAT'S NOT A BAD SIZE IS IT 
IS THIS BEDROOM ONE I DON'T KNOW 
IT'S QUITE A DECENT SIZE 
THEY'VE GOT IT AS THE DINING ROOM PRESENTLY OR SITTING ROOM DON'T KNOW QUITE WHAT IT IS 
AS THE RAIN FALLS ON OUR HEADS ON TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
JENNY REACHES FOR THE TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY UMBRELLA 
I TELL YOU WHAT THIS PLAYS HAVOC WITH ONE'S HAIR 
IT'S ALL BEEN DONE REALLY NICE HASN'T IT MUM YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO DO ANYTHING TO IT NO 
I LOVE THE WAY JANE HAS SAID YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO A THING TO THIS PROPERTY 
SHE KEEPS FORGETTING IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT YOU JANE IS IT 
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING IT'S CAROL'S GOT TO DO IT ALL 
OH WOW OH AH IT'S A GOOD SIZE ISN'T IT 
IT'S ENORMOUS THE FULL WIDTH OF THE HOUSE 
I DID NOT EXPECT A ROOM THIS SIZE IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS 
NO THAT'S A GOOD SIZE FOR A LOUNGE YEAH 
AND I THINK WITH IT BEING SQUARE YOU'RE NOT LIMITED AS TO WHERE YOU PUT YOUR FURNITURE 
THERE'S NO FOCAL WHERE'S THE FIREPLACE 
THESE MODERN HOUSES THAT'S WHERE YOUR DIY COMES IN 
IT DOESN'T MATTER YOU CAN GET AMAZING FLUE LESS FIRES 
REAL FIRES THAT DON'T NEED CHIMNEYS STILL GIVE OFF HEAT 
AMAZING WHAT SCIENTISTS CAN DO 
NEUTRAL AND LIGHT AND AIRY ISN'T IT YEAH IT IS 
ALL THE WINDOWS I THINK ON THE LANDING KEEPS IT ALL NICE AND LIGHT 
YEAH VERY IMPERSONAL OH ANOTHER BEDROOM 
OH NICE OOH BIT OF COLOUR 
IT'S BRIGHT OH IT'S QUITE NICE 
THIS IS EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE DOWNSTAIRS ISN'T IT 
IT'S THE SAME ROOM AH 
OH THAT'S QUITE GOOD ISN'T IT SAME SIZE 
YOU CAN GET A FEEL OF WHAT YOU CAN FIT IN FOR IT YEAH 
I THINK WITH THERE BEING THREE FLOORS 
WE COULD HAVE A BEDROOM AND A LITTLE LIVING SPACE EACH 
A FLOOR EACH THAT SOUNDS GOOD YOU STAY OUT OF MY ROOM I'LL STAY OUT OF YOURS 
I'LL STAY OUT OF YOURS O. K. 
THAT MIGHT INVOLVE CLEANING OH YEAH 
SO ONE COULD LIVE ON EACH LEVEL AND THEY CAN MEET AT THE BOTTOM 
WHAT'S IN THAT ONE OH WARDROBES 
EXCESS WARDROBE OR A SPARE WARDROBE SHOULD WE SAY 
YES TWO LADIES YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT OF STORAGE 
M. M. M. LITTLE BIT SMALL 
THAT'S A BIT AWKWARD ISN'T IT SINK BEHIND THE DOOR IT'S A NICE SINK 
DEFINITELY A ONE PERSON OR YOU GET SQUISHED IN 
YEAH IT'S DEFINITELY A KNOCK BEFORE YOU ENTER BATHROOM 
SO SHE'S MENTIONED A KNOCK BEFORE YOU ENTER BATHROOM 
DON'T YOU JUST PUT A LOCK ON THE DOOR 
WELL THAT'S WHAT MOST PEOPLE DO ISN'T IT O. K. 
M. M. M. BEDROOM NUMBER THREE THEN THAT'S A DECENT SIZE 
IT'S BIGGER THAN THE OTHERS ISN'T IT LOADS OF WARDROBES 
LOTS OF WARDROBE SPACE FOR LOTS OF CLOTHES YEAH THAT'S NICE 
TELL YOU WHAT WE HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT 
USUALLY WITH A MAN AND A WOMAN THE MAN COMPLAINS THAT THE WOMAN NEED LOTS OF STORAGE SPACE 
WE'VE GOT TWO GIRLS HERE IT'S A DOUBLE WHAMMY HOW MANY CLOSETS DO WE NEED A LOT 
THAT'S NICE YEAH IT'S A BIT OF A GROGGY DAY BUT I THINK IT'S 
IT'S NOT A BAD VIEW IS IT REALLY 
YEAH OH THAT'LL BE QUITE NICE I GUESS IF YOU GET THIS ONE THIS WILL BE QUITE A NICE LIGHT ROOM 
YEAH AND IT'S NICE AND BIG SO 
IT IS THAT'S A BIG BED I THINK ISN'T IT YEAH I THINK IT IS 
NOW YOU SEE I THOUGHT THEY HAD IMAGINATION AND VISION 
THEY HAVE 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE WHOLE MULTI LEVEL LIVING THING AH IT'S QUITE GOOD ISN'T IT 
I THINK WE COULD MAKE IT WORK FOR US 
I THINK WE'VE BEEN OR YOU HAVE IN YOUR CHOICE 
A BIT OF INSPIRATION HERE COS WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT BUT NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT LEVELS M. M. M. 
DIFFERENT PEOPLE ON DIFFERENT LEVELS EVERYONE WITH THEIR OWN SPACE YEAH 
THE ONE FLOOR THAT'S A PROBLEM IS THIS ONE 
I HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT THAT AND HOW THIS WORKS M. M. M. YOU'RE RIGHT 
THIS'D BE A GREAT DINING ROOM BUT IT'S A BIT TOO SMALL 
YES THAT'S A STUD WALL IT'S ONLY BLOCKED UP FROM THE GARAGE 
YOU COULD QUITE EASILY MOVE IT THAT WAY 
SO YOU ALMOST NEED TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH STORAGE YOU NEED 
HOW MUCH ROOM YOU NEED AND THEN MOVE THE WALL ACCORDINGLY OR THERE'S THE OTHER OPTION 
OF KNOCKING BETWEEN THESE TWO HAVING A KITCHEN DINING ROOM 
BUT LET'S REMEMBER TICKING THE BOXES SEPARATE DINING ROOM 
YEAH I RECKON MOVING THAT WALL THAT WAY IS THE EASY OPTION 
WELL THE BUDGET WAS PLENTIFUL IT WAS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AND I KNOW YOU WENT FIRST CAROL DIDN'T YOU LAST TIME 
M. M. M. I DID AND LOOK WHERE THAT GOT YOU YOU LOST THAT ONE 
COME ON THEN JANE ALL RIGHT IT'S YOUR GO FIRST 
O. K. I'M GOING TO GO RIGHT UP TO THE TOP OF THE BUDGET AND GO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY 
O. K. I LIKE THAT SHE'S DECISIVE STRAIGHT TO THE POINT 
I'M GOING TO GO A LITTLE BIT BELOW A T. THREE FORTY FIVE 
THIS HOUSE IS ON THE MARKET FOR THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND 
THERE YOU GO YES WELL DONE TO YOU WELL DONE IT'S ONE ALL 
AND ALSO JUST THINK ABOUT IT FOR YOUR BUDGET YOU'VE GOT FIVE THOUSAND 
TO KNOCK A WALL DOWN TO KNOCK A WALL DOWN THERE YOU GO 
SO I THINK THE FIRST TWO PROPERTIES WE'VE SEEN YOU'VE LIKED BOTH 
YEAH YEAH THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT THEY'RE DIFFERENT 
SO WHAT ON EARTH IS GONNA HAPPEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE WILD CARD 
THE ONLY WAY WE'LL FIND OUT IS GO AND SEE IT 
DATING BACK TO NINETEENTH CENTURY THIS FORMER METHODIST CHAPEL
