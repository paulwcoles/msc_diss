QUAIL'S EGGS ON THE TOP COLOUR THAT'S REALLY NICE 
WHAT DO YOU 
RECKON 
ANSWER IS ARABLE 
WHAT MORE RECKON CAN I SAY SENSATIONAL WHAT DID PETER RICHARDS CHOOSE FOR THIS SUECH LAY 
TWO DIFFERENT DISHES THIS WEEK 
BOTH CHALLENGING I'M IN KING'S 
LYNN TO FIND THE ANSWERS WITH THE 
GRUYERE AND SMOKED HADDOCK MICHEL'S 
DISH HAS STRONG FLAVOURS BUT IT IS 
ALSO A SOUFFLE A WONDERFUL 
DELICACY OF TEXTURE TO EMPHASISE 
THAT YOU COULD CHOOSE A PINOT 
GRIGIO FROM GERMANY BUT I WANT ONE 
TO STAND UP TO THOSE SMOKEY CHEESY 
FLAVOURS AND HAVE ELEGANCE THIS IS 
THE BOURGOGNE CHARDONNAY TWO THOUSAND SIX AND 
IT IS DELICIOUS STUFF 
AT SEVEN E. N. NINETY NINE THIS ISN'T THE CHEAPEST 
WINE BUT IT IS GREAT VALUE 
BECAUSE YOU GET THOSE WONDERFUL 
NUTTY CREAMY BUTTERY AROMAS 
CLASSIC OF TOP WHITE BURGUNDY THIS 
WAS FARMED NOT FAR FROM THE FAMOUS 
VILLAGE OF MERSO WHERE THE COST OF 
WINES CAN BE ASTRONOMICAL YOU GET 
A GORGEOUS PERSISTENCE OF FLAVOUR 
BUT IT IS VERY SOFT AND GENTLE 
WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR 
WITH MICHEL'S SOUFFLE YOURS IS A 
CLASSIC DISH AND THIS IS A CLASSIC 
WINE AT A BARGAIN PRICE SEVEN POINT NINE NINE IS 
THIS THE WIND YOU WOULD MATCH WITH 
THAT 
VERY MUCH SO SHARD NAY NICE THAT ON THE NOSE I'M SURPRISED AT THE 
PRICE ON THE NOSE I WOULD HAVE PUT 
A FEW MORE POUNDS ON THAT BOTTLE 
THE SOUFFLE HAS STAYED DOWN THERE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE WINE 
DELIGHTFUL IT IS AS LIGHT AND 
ALLURING IT WAS SOUFFLE SOMETHING SOMETHING WOULD TRY FOR BREAKFAST 
I DON'T 
THINK I WOULD BE ALLOWED TO I I THINK THE WINE WITH THE HADDOCK IT 
IS A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN YOU YOU COULD BE JOINING US AT THE TABLE 
SOME TIME IN THE SERIES 
LATER ON WE LEARN THE SECRETS OF A 
CLASSIC BOLOGNESE SAUCE FROM NONE 
OTHER THAN ANTONIO CARLUCCIO BUT 
FIRST IT'S TIME TO HEAD TO CORNWALL 
FOR A WEEKLY DOSE OF RICK STEIN HE 
IS BY THE RIVER BANK TODAY BUT 
THERE IS NO MOLE RATTY OR EVEN MR. 
TOAD TO HANG OUT WITH TWO CHILDREN 
AND A GRUMPY DOG AND A MAN CALLED 
THE FISHER KING 
THE CAMEL RIVER IS FAMOUS FOR SALMON FISHING 
CHARLIE BETTINSON IS KNOWN LOCALLY AS THE FISHER KING SO VERY GOOD IS HE AT CATCHING SALMON 
HE REMINDS ME OF A HERON WATCHING FOR EVERY TINY MOVEMENT IN THE WATER 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY SMALL BOYS AND SMALL DOGS WHILE VERY KEEN TO GO FISHING 
SOON FIND THE ETERNAL WAITING FOR A BITE EXTREMELY TEDIOUS 
YOU'RE BORED AND HUNGRY YES 
WELL WHAT'RE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT WE'RE HERE FOR ANOTHER AT LEAST TWO HOURS WHAT 
CHARLIE DOGGEDLY FISHES ON WHILE THE DULL GRIP OF BOREDOM DESCENDS ON CHALKIE AND MY SON CHARLES 
DAD TWO HOURS IS A LONG TIME 
IT'S ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MINUTES RIGHT 
THAT IS A LONG TIME A MINUTE IS SIXTY SECONDS 
AND SIXTY SECONDS IS 
WE'VE GOT IM GOOD FISH TOO TWELVE THIRTEEN 
OH HE'S GONE 
CAME OFF ABOUT TWELVE POUND HE WAS 
WE'RE ALL SITTING ROUND ACTUALLY STANDING ALL GETTING A BIT BORED 
CHARLES MY YOUNGEST SON HAS BEEN A RIGHT PAIN HE'S HUNGRY 
WE NEARLY CAUGHT A FISH BUT CHARLIE'S JUST STANDING THERE GETTING ON WITH IT 
HE SHOWS NO SIGNS OF FLAGGING HE'S NOT BORED HE'S JUST FISHING HIS MOVEMENTS GENTLE AND PRECISE 
AND WE'RE JUST LEADEN FOOTED HEAVY FOOTED 
AND WHEN YOU SEE THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT GOES INTO IT 
WHEN HE BRINGS A SALMON INTO THE RESTAURANT IT'S LIKE A TREASURE 
ONE CHAP CALLED ED THE BASS COMES IN WITH BASS HE'S A SEA FISHERMAN 
IT'S WRAPPED IN A CLOTH AND HE UNWRAPS IT HE DOESN'T REALLY WANT YOU TO HAVE IT IT'S HIS TREASURE 
WHEN YOU SEE SOMEBODY LIKE CHARLIE WHO'S SPENT TWO HOURS JUST FISHING NEVER GETTING BORED AND WE 
QUIETLY I WOULDN'T MIND GOING HOME FOR A CUP OF TEA BUT HE'LL BE THERE UNTIL HE CATCHES A FISH 
CHARLIE FISHED ON ALL THAT DAY BUT CHARLES AND CHALKIE DROVE US ALL DEMENTED AND FINALLY WE LEFT 
UNFORTUNATELY CHARLIE DIDN'T CATCH A FISH SOME DAYS THERE JUST AIN'T NO FISH 
BUT HERE IS A PERFECT CAMEL SALMON AND THIS IS HOW I KNOW TO COOK IT BEST SALMON WITH SORREL SAUCE 
I'M GOING TO CUT THE FISH INTO SLICES OR ESCALOPES 
THE POINT IS NOT TO MAKE THE SLICES TOO THICK BECAUSE I WANT TO COOK THEM VERY QUICKLY 
BY THE TIME THE OUTSIDE IS COOKED THE INSIDE SHOULD BE STILL WELL NOT RAW BUT QUITE PINK 
FINALLY THE LAST SLICE 
I'M PETRIFIED ABOUT CUTTING MY FINGERS OFF BUT THERE YOU GO THAT'S FIVE SLICES NOW THE SAUCE 
SOME SUPERLATIVE FISH STOCK MADE WITH BOILED UP DOVER SOLE BONES AND TURBOT BONES ONLY THE BEST 
NOW THE VERMOUTH THIS IS NOILLY PRAT THE BEST ONE FOR IT 
IT'S NOT THAT DRY IT'S A MIXTURE OF WHITE WINE AND HERBS 
AND A MARVELLOUS BITTER BACK TASTE 
THAT'S BUBBLING AWAY NICELY SUCH A SIMPLE SAUCE 
ALL WE PUT IN APART FROM NOILLY PRAT AND FISH STOCK ARE CREAM AND SLICED ONIONS 
LEAVE THE ONIONS TO COOK A BIT 
PERHAPS A LITTLE CREAM NOW NOT TOO MUCH AT THIS STAGE BECAUSE IT'LL BOIL OVER 
BUT JUST TO GET IN SOME NOW STARTS THE RICHENING PROCESS UP 
LEAVE THAT TO COOK FOR TWENTY MINUTES OR SO THEN FINISH THE SAUCE OFF WITH MORE CREAM BUTTER AND SORREL 
THE SECRET OF ALL CREAM SAUCES 
IS TO REDUCE THE VOLUME OF LIQUID DOWN TO A CONCENTRATED ESSENCE SIEVE IT INTO ANOTHER PAN 
AND CHOP UP THE SORREL FINELY HAVING TAKEN OFF THE STALKS 
THAT'S ENOUGH 
NOW BACK TO THE SAUCE AND IN WITH SOME OF THIS WONDERFUL SORREL WITH THE HERBY SMELL 
AND NOW THE RICHENING AGENTS I LIKE TO CALL THEM 
PLENTY OF CREAM THIS REALLY IS A RICH SAUCE AND A COUPLE OF GOOD SCOOPS OF BUTTER 
AND A WHISK 
JUST WHISK THAT BUTTER IN OR AS THE FRENCH CALL IT MONTER AU BEURRE WHICH IS VERY GRAND 
IT'S GOING IN FAST AS IT'S SOFT AND THAT'S IT 
KEEP THAT WARM WHILE WE COOK THE SALMON 
FIRST WE GET THIS LARGE BLACK PAN 
POUR A THIN FILM OF OIL OVER IT 
SWIRL IT AROUND TO COVER THE BOTTOM 
NOW THIS IS SMOKING HOT 
YOU'D BE AMAZED HOW QUICKLY THESE COOK FAR MORE QUICKLY THAN AN EGG 
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR THAT SIDE 
A LITTLE BIT OF SALT 
AND STRAIGHT OVER 
IF YOU'RE NOT SUPER QUICK YOU'VE GOT OVERCOOKED SALMON NOT WHAT YOU WANT 
THEY SHOULD BE SERVED STRAIGHT AWAY 
THEY'RE STILL COOKING EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE OFF THE HEAT NOW SO I'VE GOT TO GET THEM OUT OF THE PAN 
ONCE THEY'VE LEFT THE PAN IT'S O. K. 
AND NOT OVER THE TOP BUT JUST ROUND I PUT THIS DELICIOUS SORREL SAUCE 
A FINAL TOUCH A BIT OF FRESH SORREL DRAPED OVER IT 
A CLASSIC NORTHERN EUROPEAN FISH DISH 
AND EVERY TIME A BIT LIKE RAY AU BEURRE NOIR SKATE WITH BLACK BUTTER JUST PERFECT EVERY TIME 
IT'S LIKE COCO CHANEL'S LITTLE BLACK DRESS YOU KNOW 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT A LITTLE BLACK 
DRESS BUT THAT SORREL SAUCE LOOKED 
DELICIOUS YOU CAN ADD FRESH PEAS 
TO THAT WHICH ALSO WORKS WELL YOU 
CAN FIND THE RECIPE FOR THAT ON OUR 
WEBSITE BBCCO.UK SLASH FOOD THERE ARE 
SO MANY WAYS TO USE SALMON L. HAVE 
A RECIPE NOW TO USE FRESH OR SMOKED 
SALMON MY SALMON CONFIT TERRINE 
I'M GOING TO COOK THIS IN A WAY YOU 
PROBABLY HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE L. 
HAD THIS IN FRANCE WITH DUCK BUT 
FIRST I'M GOING TO TRIM THE SALMON CUT IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH IF I 
HAD DONE THAT THERE ADD BE BLOOD 
ALL OVER THE KITCHEN 
PUT THE 
FILLETS OF SALMON ON THE TRAY CUT 
THIS DOWN AGAIN CUT THROUGH THE 
WAY I'M GOING TO COOK THIS IS 
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT YOU'VE PROBABLY 
NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE WITH FISH 
BUT IT WORKS WELL IT IS WITH DUCK 
FAT CONFIT ED IN DUCK FAT BLACK 
PEPPER OVER THE TOP AND TAKE THE 
DUCK FAT AND SPRINKLE IT OVER THE 
TOP THIS IS GREAT FOR ROAST 
POTATOES 
YOU ARE GOING TO TELL ME POTATOES THAT'S HEALTHY NEXT 
IT IS VERY 
HEALTHY DUCK FAT IS 
IS IT IT L. I HAVE TO COMPLIMENT YOU ON THE 
THICKNESS OF THE SALMON IT WILL 
COOK PERFECTLY WELL 
THANK YOU 
WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING RIGHT YOU'VE 
GOT BE TOLD 
SIX AND A HALF MINUTES 
SIX AND A HALF MINUTES IN THE OVEN 
LINE THE TERRINE WITH CLINGFILM AND 
TAKE THE SMOKED SALMON AND PLACE IT 
IN HERE WHY THE PASSION FOR 
OYSTERS 
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN I OYSTERS FIRST HAS OYSTERS BUT IT'S BECOME 
AN OBSESSION OVER THE YEARS EVERY 
CHRISTMAS AND EASTER I SEEM TO GET

IF YOU SERVE THEM FOR DOORSTEP GUESTS COULD HAVE SOME DODGY ONES 
YES A MEMBER OF MY FAMILY NOW

EXPERIENCES WITH MINE NOT THAT I 
CULTIVATED THEM MYSELF I HASTE ON 
THE ADD I'M DREADING THE DAY WHEN

THERE WERE FOUR DOZEN ON THE 
DOORSTEP I PHONED THE RESTAURANT 
AND SAID THIS IS EMBARRASSING I'VE 
GOT EIGHT DOZEN BY MISTAKE AND SHE JUST 
SAID HAPPY CHRISTMAS YOU'VE DONE 
A FRENCH FILM

PARTICULARLY IN SUPERMARKETS YOU

I CAN'T WORK OUT WHAT THE DUCK IS 
DOING IT BUT WHY WOULDN'T YOU USE 
GOOSE FAT

FLAVOUR SO MUCH DON'T USE OIL USE

APRICOTS SAUTEED IN A HOT PAN 
ADDED TO CAR MERBLGS ORANGE AND 
LEMON JUICE SERVED WARM WITH 
VANILLA ICE CREAM THE GUESTS AND 
SOME OF THE VIEWERS DECIDE HIS FATE 
NIC ANY IDEA 
I LOVE OISTERS 
COMING FROM NEW ZEALAND BUT THE 
APRICOTS ARE ANSWER IS SAIRBL SAR SAR LINE 
I'M GOING FOR THE OYSTERS LINE COMING UP NIC HAS A JAPANESE 
CHICKEN RECIPE BUT NOW IT'S TIME 
FOR ANOTHER COOKERY LESSON FROM 
NIGELLA LAWSON THIS WEEK HER 
DAUGHTER IS HAVING A SLEEPOVER AND 
NIGELLA HAS A HOUSEFUL OF GIGGLING 
GIRLS LUCKILY SHE HAS SECRET 
WEAPON IN HER LORDER JUST PERFECT 
FOR THE JOB 
WHEN I HAVE CHILDREN ROUND AT THE WEEKEND AND I HAVE A LOT 
I ALWAYS FIND THAT PANCAKES AND BLUEBERRY SYRUP ARE THE SIMPLEST BREAKFAST THINGS TO MAKE 
BECAUSE THEY ALL LIKE THEM 
SO I'M NOT HAVING TO MAKE ONE THING FOR ONE CHILD AND ANOTHER FOR ANOTHER 
SO THE PANCAKES ARE A SNAP AND I'LL COME TO THAT BUT FOR NOW THE BLUEBERRY SYRUP 
IT'S A GOOD WAY OF MAKING CHILDREN EAT FRUIT 
IT'S VERY SIMPLE TWO INGREDIENTS 
ABOUT ONE TWENTY FIVE M. L. S. OF MAPLE SYRUP THERE 
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED GRAMS OF BLUEBERRIES 
NOW THE IDEA IS 
THAT AS THE MAPLE SYRUP HEATS SO DO THE BLUEBERRIES 
AND THEN WHEN THEY GET REALLY HOT THEY BEGIN TO POP AND THE TWO MERGE TOGETHER TO BECOME A SAUCE 
AND WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS IS THAT WHEN IT'S WARM IT'S PERFECT AS A SYRUP OVER PANCAKES 
AND WHEN IT'S COLD SHOULD YOU BE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE ANY LEFTOVERS IT'S GORGEOUS AS A SOFT SET JAM 
TO HAVE WITH THICK SLICES OF WHITE BREAD 
UM GORGEOUS 
THE THING ABOUT THIS THAT I FIND VERY REASSURING IS THAT YOU'RE NOT ADDING ANY SUGAR JUST BLUEBERRIES 
AND MAPLE SYRUP BOTH OF WHICH ARE MEANT TO BE VERY GOOD FOR YOU 
AT LEAST I HEAR THAT AND I LIKE TO BELIEVE IT 
ALL THAT BUBBLING MAGENTA MAKES ME FEEL THAT IT'S READY 
I THINK WE ARE READY TO POUR 
STAND BACK M. M. M. 
SO THAT'S THE SYRUP DONE 
AND AS FOR THE PANCAKES I HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY AT MY FINGERTIPS 
HERE IT IS THE THING THAT'S GOING TO MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER 
WHAT IT IS IT'S MY HOMEMADE INSTANT PANCAKE MIX 
AND IT'S SO EASY TO MAKE 
A COUPLE OF MINUTES' WORK AND THEN FRANKLY YOU ARE GIVEN A FEW LINES AT THE WEEKEND 
IN HERE I'VE GOT SIX HUNDRED GRAMS OF PLAIN FLOUR 
INTO THIS I MIX FIFTY GRAMS OF BAKING POWDER 
I THEN ADD TWO TEASPOONS OF BICARB 
JUST ONE TEASPOON OF ORDINARY SALT 
FINALLY I PUT IN FIFTY GRAMS OF CASTER SUGAR BUT YOU COULD USE ORDINARY SUGAR 
MIX IT UP AND WHAT YOU HAVE IS A JAR OF MIX 
SO THIS 
IS HOW MY MAGIC MIX GETS TRANSFORMED INTO BREAKFAST 
YOU TAKE A CUP 
OF THE PANCAKE MIXTURE 
THERE WE ARE JUST MIX IT UP LIKE THIS SLOWLY AND CALMLY 
AND I KNOW WE DON'T USE CUPS BUT IT MAKES IT MUCH EASIER THAN ACTUALLY WEIGHING OUT 
THE MIXTURE IN THE MORNING IT DEFEATS THE OBJECT OF THE EXERCISE 
BUT IF YOU WANT TO YOU CAN 
IT'S ONE HUNDRED FIFTY GRAMS AND ANYWAY YOU DON'T NEED TO USE 
A REGULAR MEASURING CUP JUST USE A CAPPUCCINO CUP 
AND FOR EACH CUP OF MIX 
ONE EGG 
AND ONE CUP OF MILK 
AND IF YOU FEEL LIKE MEASURING IT'S TWO FIFTY M. L. S. 
IN THAT GOES 
BIT OF LIGHT WHISKING 
JUST WHISK LIGHTLY TOGETHER 
SO YOU'VE GOT A THICKISH BATTER 
I TEND TO GET ABOUT FIFTEEN PANCAKES OUT OF THIS AMOUNT 
I MEAN I CAN EKE IT OUT TO MAKE MORE BUT COUNT ON FIFTEEN 
THERE'S ONE SMALL STEP THAT I THINK IS CRUCIAL FOR PANCAKES 
AND IT'S A VERY EASY THING AS WELL WHICH IS SIMPLY I WANT A TABLESPOON 
OF MELTED BUTTER IT'S ABOUT FIFTEEN GRAMS AGAIN IF YOU'RE IN THE MEASURING MOOD 
MAY AS WELL GET THE GRIDDLE SORTED WHILE I'M HERE 
IT CAN WARM UP

THAT'S LOOKING NICE I'M GOING TO GET MY PANCAKE STASHER 
THAT'S DONE PERFECT 
IN THE BUTTER GOES

PETER HAS CHOSEN TO GO WITH THE 
FANTASTIC CHICKEN 
NIC'S DISH IS A COMBINATION OF 
INTINSITY AND SUBTLETY IT IS 
TYPICAL OF JAPANESE CUISINE LOOK 
AT THE FLAVOURS IN THE MARINADE 
FRUITINESS SALTINESS SWEETNESS 
EVEN HEAT AND SPICE YOU COULD 
START WITH TEA EVEN SAKE OR A 
SPARKLING WINE OR A FINO SHERRY 
BUT I WANT TO STICK IN THE 
CLASSICAL WINE WORLD TO DO THAT I 
WANT ONE PARTICULAR GRAPE VARIETY 
FOR THAT I NEED RIESLING THIS IS 
DELICIOUS STUFF 
IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT GERMAN 
RIESLING ISN'T THE WORLD'S FAVOUR 
DRINK BECAUSE IT HAS TOUCH OF 
SWEETNESS BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK OF 
THIS WINE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE 
DISH THAT IS SUPERB STUFF WE NEED 
THAT LOVELY SUGARY SWEETNESS TO 
GIVER THE WINICS T. R. A. BODY TO MATCH 
ALL THOSE DIFFERENT FLAVOURS AND 
TO PICK UP ON THE FRUITINESS OF THE 
DISH AND TO OFFSET THE SPICINESS 
AND THE HEAT I COULD HAVE CHOSEN A 
RIESLING FROM NEW ZEALAND OR 
AUSTRALIA BUT WHAT GERMANY DOES 
BRILLIANTLY IS GIVE YOU INTENSITY 
WITH THE SWEETNESS AND DELICACY OF 
FLAVOUR THAT'S WHAT WE ARE LOOKING 
FOR WITH NIC'S DISH THIS WINE IS 
BEAUTIFUL BUT BINGE YOUR DISH WILL 
MAKE IT TASTE EVEN BETTER I 
THINK YOUR DISH WILL MAKE IT TASTE

SHELL AND THE BUTTER WILL HUGH GET 
HIS BEER BATTERED OYSTERS WITH 
WATERCRESS SALAD OR CARAMELISED 
APRICOTS WITH NUTS THE MAJORITY OF 
THE CALLERS WENT FOR HEAVEN BUT THE 
GUYS IN THE STUDIO HAVE YET TO MAKE 
THEIR DECISION FIRST HIT OF 
CLASSIC ITALIAN CUISINE FROM THE 
GODFATHER ANTONIO CARLUCCIO HE IS 
I. N. MODNA BUT HE IS ON HIS BIKE HE 
IS AFTER A CLASSIC BOLOGNESE SAUCE 
IF YOU THOUGHT IT ALWAYS WENT WITH 
SPAGHETTI BE PREPARED FOR SHOCK AS HE HAS SOME SHOCKING NEWS 
IT IS NOT JUST FOOD WHICH MAKES 
ILIE A SPERGE PLACE IT IS THE 
WHOLE WAY OF LIFE 
WHOLE WAY OF LIFE 
TO BE LAZY IN A 
LITTLE CAFE IN THE SHADE OF HISTORY 
ONE COULD SAY BECAUSE WE ARE HERE 
IN THE MIDDLE OF MODENA AND THE 
HISTORIC CENTRE IS ONLY WONDERFUL 
OLD BUILDINGS SIPPING GLASS OF 
WATER HAVING LITTLE COFFEE AND 
READING THE PAPER THIS IS A 
FANTASTIC TIME 
THIS IS THE CENTRE OF VERY GOOD FOOD IN ITALY 
IT OFFERS THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBABLY 
PIECES OF FOOD PARMA HAM PARMESAN 
BALSAMIC VINEGAR 
ON THE OTHER SIDE WE HAVE PAVAROTTI FERRARI MIRELLA FRENI 
WHAT DO YOU WANT MORE IT'S A COUNTRY OF PROMISES HERE 
THE VERY IDEA OF IT FRESH PASTA FROM EMILIA ROMAGNA 
THIS IS JANA AND SHE MAKES FRESH PASTA FOR HER FAMILY IN BUSSETO 
THAT INCLUDES SUNDAYS TOO 
IT'S A RHYTHM OF LIFE 
SHE MAKES THE PASTA WITH DOUBLE ZERO FLOUR A SPECIAL FINE FLOUR FOUR EGGS AND NO WATER 
SHE SAYS SHE HAS PASTA FOR LUNCH IN SOUP PASTA WITH SPINACH 
PASTA IS SIMPLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THEIR LIVES 
SEE IT HAS TO BE THIS THIN AND THEN IT'S SLICED FINELY SLICED 
TOSSING IT THROUGH THE AIR DRIES IT 
THEN YOU WAIT FOR TWO HOURS THEN YOU COOK 
WATCH THIS SAUCE AS MOST PROBABLY UP TILL NOW YOU'VE DONE IT WRONG 
THIS IS THE REAL THING BUTTER AND OLIVE OIL TO PRODUCE A WONDERFUL BOLOGNESE SAUCE 
IT'S NEVER SERVED WITH SPAGHETTI BUT WITH NOODLES 
HOMEMADE WHICH I WILL SHOW YOU VERY SOON 
THE STARTING OF THIS SAUCE IS A LITTLE BUTTER OIL AND ONIONS 
THE OLD TRICK IS THIS ONE TO USE TWO TYPES OF MEAT 
ONE IS THE BEEF NICE MINCED BEEF 
NOT THAT ROTTEN MEAT THAT SOMETIMES SOMEBODY GIVES YOU FULL OF FAT THIS ONE IS QUITE LEAN 
YOU PUT IT ON LIKE THAT AND IT IS A DELICIOUS THING TO DO 
THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER MEAT WHICH GIVES MORE FLAVOUR THE PORK 
MINCED PORK YOU HAVE TO ASK FOR THIS FROM BUTCHER TO GIVE YOU GOOD PORK 
IT COULD BE FATTY THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT 
WE PUT EVERYTHING IN AND THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE BOLOGNESE 
OH 
THE ONLY TRICK IS IT HAS TO COOK A LONG TIME 
AND JUST NOW AS THE MEAT IS STARTING TO BE BROWN WE ADD THE OTHER INGREDIENTS 
WHICH IS FIRST OF ALL A LITTLE BIT OF TOMATO CONCENTRATE TOMATO 
AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT THIS IS THE POLPA DI POMODORO THE PULP OF TOMATO 
YOU CAN FIND IT EVERYWHERE 
THIS IS THE STUFF WHICH IS GOING TO COOK FOR SOME TIME 
BUT NATURALLY WE HAVE TO ADD ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF WINE 
WHICH HERE IS THE LOCAL ONE 
AND IS THE BUBBLY STUFF THAT YOU DRINK IN EMILIA ROMAGNA EVERYWHERE 
NOW WE LET IT COOK FOR QUITE SOME TIME THAT'S THE SECRET 
SO A LITTLE BIT OF SALT THERE WE ARE 
JUST A LITTLE BIT YOU WILL ADJUST IT LATER 
NOW YOU CAN GO TO CHURCH 
IF YOU DO IT IN THE EVENING FOR THE WEEKEND YOU CAN WATCH TELEVISION 
AND SO ON YOU JUST LEAVE IT THERE BUBBLING PLUP PLUP LIKE LAVA IN A VOLCANO 
THAT'S ALL THAT HAS TO HAPPEN FOR THREE HOURS 
ABOVE ALL DON'T PUT ANY OREGANO ANY BASIL ANY PARSLEY 
I'LL ALLOW YOU TO PUT A LITTLE GARLIC IF YOU LIKE IT BUT NOTHING ELSE 
THIS IS THE REAL BOLOGNESE SAUCE 
SO JANA'S PASTA COMES INTO BOILING WATER SLIGHTLY SALTED 
THESE ARE THE TAGLIATELLE VERY FRESH AND NICE THEY COOK IN MINUTES 
NOT MORE THAN THAT 
MEANWHILE I'M PREPARING A PAN JUST GIVE A LITTLE STIR THERE 
AND I GIVE A LITTLE PAN HERE AND A BIT OF THE FIRE 
THEN I TAKE A BIT OF THE WONDERFUL SAUCE THIS IS THE SAUCE 
I TAKE ONE ARE TWO SPOONS OF THE SAUCE INTO THE PAN 
AND A BIT MORE FIRE 
SO THIS IS WHERE THE PASTA NOW WILL BE SAUTED 
YOU SEE HOW MUCH OF THE SAUCE IS STILL LEFT THERE 
HERE THE PASTA IS COOKING VERY QUICKLY 
SO QUICK IT COOKS THIS PASTA IT'S VERY FRESH LET ME SEE 
IT'S AL DENTE ENOUGH FOR ME 
HERE WE ARE THIS IS GOING WELL 
I DRAIN IT 
THERE IT IS 
A W. W. W. THE SMELL OF THE PASTA IS WONDERFUL 
NOW IT COMES INTO THIS LOVELY PAN HERE 
A W. W. W. 
THIS IS A WORK OF REALLY A WORK OF LOVE 
NOW IT COMES THE SAUTEING 
LOOK THE MIXING AUTOMATICALLY THE SAUCE SHOULD JUST COAT THE PASTA 
SO DONE THIS 
NOW IT COMES TO THE SERVING DISH AND THERE WE ARE LOOK AT THIS HERE 
OH 
AND NOW THE FAMOUS PARMESAN CHEESE COMES INTO OPERATION 
QUITE ENOUGH OF THAT 
AND THERE WE ARE 
SORRY I REALLY DON'T WANT TO SHARE IT WITH ANYBODY 
ALL FOR ME I AM GREEDY TODAY 
I WOULD LIKE TO TASTE IT BECAUSE IT LOOKS FANTASTIC 
MMM WONDERFUL 
IF YOU'RE COOKING PASTA LIKE THAT 
YOU WILL FORGET ALL THE PREPARED SAUCES THAT YOU SEE AROUND 
M. M. M.
