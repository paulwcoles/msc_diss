HERE SHE MEETS EMPLOYEE KAREN IN NEED OF A FIVE STAR CONSULTATION 
DOES ANYBODY NEED TO SEE A STREET DOCTOR 
TONIGHT ON STREET DOCTOR 
THERE'S AN ANXIOUS HOLIDAY MAKER 
IT'S SO IRRITATING I KEEP MOVING IT AND I'M REALLY WORRIED THAT IT'S CANCEROUS 
IT'S CHILD'S PLAY FOR ONE DOCTOR 
ARE YOU PLAYING WITH ME 
I THINK YOU ARE 
AND A PATIENT'S WORLD IS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN 
YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME ARTHRITIS 
MEET THE STREET DOCTORS FOUR G. P.'S DETERMINED TO TACKLE THE HEALTH OF BRITAIN 
FIRST IS DOCTOR JONTY WHOSE PRIMARY CONCERN IS PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE 
NEXT UP IS DOCTOR GEORGE WHO'S DEVOTED TO MATTERS OF THE HEART 
DOCTOR BARBARA IS OUR FEMALE G. P. WHO SPECIALISES IN WOMEN AND CHILDREN 
AND FINALLY DOCTOR AYAN WHOSE INTEREST IS MEN'S HEALTH 
THEY TRAVEL THE LAND SEARCHING FOR PATIENTS TO TREAT 
THEIR MISSION TO MAKE THE U. K.'S STREETS A HEALTHIER PLACE 
THIS WEEK THEIR TARGET THE LAKE DISTRICT 
NO APPOINTMENTS NO WAITING THE STREET DOCTORS ARE COMING TO YOU 
CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE IN CUMBRIA IS HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE 
AND ONE OF THE MAJOR CAUSES OF THIS IS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE 
THE LACK OF MAJOR TOWNS AND CITIES IN CUMBRIA MEANS 
THAT MANY PEOPLE LIVING HERE DO NOT HAVE EASY ACCESS TO A DOCTOR'S SURGERY 
DESPITE BEING THE SECOND MOST RURAL COUNTY IN THE COUNTRY 
EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE CUMBRIAN POPULATION DON'T EAT ENOUGH FRUIT AND VEG 
IT'S THE STREET DOCTORS' TASK TO MAKE THE LAKES A HEALTHIER PLACE TO LIVE 
KEEP BLOWING KEEP BLOWING KEEP BLOWING 
THEY'LL GO BACK TO BASICS DO YOU KNOW YOUR A B.'S AND C.'S 
I'VE BEEN A TEACHER FOR EIGHT YEARS SO YOU DO HOPEFULLY YEAH 
FIND A NEW VOCATION PEOPLE MAY THINK I'M A WITCH DOCTOR 
DOTTORE DI STRADA AND GET LOST IN TRANSLATION 
IT'S LIKE A PROSTITUTE OH REALLY I DON'T WANT TO BE THAT 
DOCTOR GEORGE STARTS HIS SURGERY EARLY AND PUTS HIS BEST FOOT FORWARD ON THE HONISTER PASS 
IT'S AT TWO THOUSAND F. T. ON THE VIA FERRATA 
THAT HE MEETS A WOMAN WHO'S RUN INTO A BIT OF A MEDICAL PROBLEM 
HELLO HI I'M GLAD I SPOTTED YOU 
YES INDEED HELLO HI DOG AS WELL HOW ARE YOU DOING 
I'M ALL RIGHT I'VE GOT A BIT OF A SORE ANKLE GOING ON 
HOW LONG HAS THIS BOTHERED YOU FOR 
I BROKE MY TOE AT THE END OF LAST YEAR 
WHAT TOE DID YOU BREAK AT THE TIME I BROKE MY BIG TOE THE LITTLE ONE AND THE ONE NEXT TO IT 
COULD YOU TAKE YOUR TRAINER OFF 
SURE I'LL HAVE A WEE LOOK AT IT EXAMINE YOUR FOOT HERE I THINK 
WHERE IS THIS PAIN THAT YOU'VE NOW GOT 
IT STARTS FROM THE ARCH OF MY FOOT HERE 
AND TENDS TO COME AROUND THIS SIDE 
THAT COULD BE AFTER A MILE THAT THAT WOULD START YEAH ABSOLUTELY 
PART OF WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS FASCIITIS IN THE UNDERPART OF THE FOOT 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THEN FASCIITIS FASCIITIS IS AN INFLAMMATION 
WITH THE FIBROUS BANDS WHICH ARE HOLDING THE ARCH INTO POSITION WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT YOU 
JUST GET A CAN OF BEANS AND ROLL YOUR FOOT 
BACK AND FORWARD AND BACK AND FORWARD 
OVER THE ACTUAL CAN OF THE BAKED BEANS 
AND THAT IS ACTUALLY STIMULATING 
THE FIBROUS BANDS WHICH ARE HOLDING THE ARCH INTO POSITION 
AS FAR AS YOUR ANKLE IS CONCERNED DO YOU KNOW YOUR A B.'S AND C.'S 
I'VE BEEN A TEACHER FOR EIGHT YEARS SO YOU DO HOPEFULLY YEAH 
THEN YOU COULD DO THE LETTER B. 
NOW WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT 
YOU'RE ACTUALLY BUILDING UP THE MUSCLES IN THE ANKLE 
AND OF COURSE THE FINAL ONE IS A B. AND THEN IT'S C. O. K. 
IF YOU DO THAT SUPPORTING YOUR THIGH 
YOU'LL FIND THAT WHAT IT'S DOING IS 
IT'S STRENGTHENING THE MUSCLES AROUND ABOUT THE ANKLE 
DO REMEMBER ALSO ANYA REST IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE TREATMENT 
I THINK I'LL DEFINITELY TRY THE PHYSIO EXERCISES 
THE A. B. C. AND THE CAN OF BEANS 
BUT THE PROBLEM IS IF PEOPLE TELL ME TO REST 
I FIND THAT VERY TRICKY MOST RUNNERS ARE THE SAME 
THEY'LL SAY O. K. STRAP IT UP THEN GET PROPER STRAPPING MAKE SURE THERE'S EXTRA SUPPORT 
I CAN'T PROMISE THAT I WON'T RUN BUT I'LL STRAP IT UP ALL THE BEST 
THANK YOU I HOPE YOU WIN WHICHEVER RACES YOU'RE IN THANK YOU 
OH AYAN IT'S COLD OUT HERE I HOPE YOU'VE GOT YOUR THERMALS ON 
OH GOD YEAH FREEZING 
DOCTOR JONTY AND DOCTOR AYAN HAVE DECIDED TO PITCH THEIR SURGERY IN A HOLIDAY PARK 
HELLO DOCTOR AND IT'S NOT LONG 
BEFORE ONE OF THE HOLIDAY MAKERS HAS DOCTOR AYAN WITHIN EARSHOT 
YEAH I'VE GOT A REAL PROBLEM WITH THIS LEFT EAR 
I DO QUITE A BIT OF SCUBA DIVING AND OCCASIONALLY WHEN I GO DOWN 
IT SEEMS AS IF IT'S BLOCKED AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO CLEAR 
AND I GET QUITE A BIT OF PAIN WITH IT RIGHT 
DOES IT FEEL LIKE YOU'VE GOT COTTON WOOL IN YOUR EAR 
YES IT DOES IT FEELS WOOLLY 
O. K. IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO GET THESE THINGS CHECKED OUT AND IF YOU LEAVE THINGS 
OFTEN THEY JUST GET WORSE 
LOOK TOWARDS ME A LITTLE PERFECT 
PERFECT 
DO YOU MIND IF I LOOK IN THE OTHER ONE NO NO JUST TO COMPARE SIDES 
YEAH THAT'S FINE AS WELL BRILLIANT 
THE GOOD NEW THERE IS BOTH EARS LOOK NORMAL 
THE EARDRUMS ARE ABSOLUTELY FINE 
THEY'RE NOT BULGING THEY'RE NOT DULL AND YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING 
IN THE EAR CANALS EITHER 
THERE'S NO WAX OR BLOCKAGE THERE 
SO THIS TO ME SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING CALLED EUSTACHIAN TUBE DYSFUNCTION 
WHICH HAPPENS COMMONLY AFTER COLDS 
OR THINGS LIKE DIVING CAN CERTAINLY BRING IT ON 
AND IT'S THE TUBE THAT RUNS FROM YOUR EAR TO YOUR NOSE 
THAT CAN SOMETIMES BECOME BLOCKED 
A GOOD THING TO DO IN THE SHORT TERM 
IS TO TAKE A STEROID NASAL SPRAY LIKE THE ONES YOU USE FOR HAY FEVER 
WHICH YOU CAN BUY FROM THE PHARMACIST THAT CAN OFTEN CLEAR THE TUBE 
BUT IF IT KEEPS COMING BACK SEE YO L. RDO O. R. 
AND GET REFERRED ON TO AN EAR NOSE AND THROAT CONSULTANT 
THAT'S GREAT LOVELY NO WORRIES NICE TALKING TO YOU 
SO THERE'S ONE HAPPY CAMPER 
MEANWHILE DOCTOR BARBARA HAS GONE UPMARKET AND STARTS HER SURGERY 
AT ONE OF WINDERMERE'S LUXURY HOTELS 
HERE SHE MEETS EMPLOYEE KAREN IN NEED OF A FIVE STAR CONSULTATION 
I HAVE HAD AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH MY KNEE FOR QUITE A LONG TIME NOW 
I USED TO BE A CONTORTIONIST AND NOW I THINK 
THE KNEE PROBLEMS ARE DOWN TO WHAT I USED TO DO BEFORE 
DO YOU WANT ME TO SHOW YOU DO YOU THINK YOU CAN YEAH OF COURSE 
O. K. THEN I'LL STEP BACK 
GOODNESS ME FANTASTIC 
WELL DONE THANK YOU 
YOU'VE PROBABLY PUT A LOT OF STRAIN ON THAT JOINT 
ARE YOU STIFF IN THE MORNING WHEN YOU GET UP OR 
YES A LITTLE BIT BUT NOT AS IT'S NEVER BEEN THIS BAD NO 
I'M JUST GOING TO PUT MY HAND ON YOUR KNEE 
O. K. NOW REST YOUR LEG ON THERE 
I'M JUST GOING TO JUST CHECK 
IT FEELS QUITE SWOLLEN 
YEAH I'M JUST THINKING YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME FLUID THERE 
I SUSPECT IT MIGHT BE TO DO WITH THE CARTILAGE INSIDE YOUR KNEE 
YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME ARTHRITIS YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME DAMAGE 
TO THE CARTILAGE THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY KNOW WOULD BE 
TO HAVE A SCAN OF YOUR KNEE O. K. 
IT GIVES YOU A THREE D. VIEW IF YOU LIKE OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR KNEE 
WHILST DOCTOR BARBARA SENDS KAREN FOR HER SCAN 
OUR OTHER G. P.'S GO UNDERGROUND AND ON WATER 
TO TREAT THE PEOPLE OF THE LAKE DISTRICT 
ANY PAIN IF I DO THAT THAT HURTS A BIT 
OOH WHERE ON THE KNEE 
MEANWHILE DOCTOR JONTY IS STILL SAMPLING THE GREAT OUTDOORS AT THE CAMPSITE 
NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR NO 
WHERE HE MEETS HIS FIRST PATIENT WHO'S GOT A REAL DILEMMA 
HAVE YOU GOT ANY ADVICE ABOUT ALLERGIES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
I'VE GOT TWO CATS I THINK I COULD BE ALLERGIC TO THEM 
BECAUSE MY CHEST GOES REALLY TIGHT SO I'M ASTHMATIC AS WELL 
AND DO YOU THINK THE CHEST TIGHTNESS AND SO ON COINCIDES 
WITH HAVING CATS IN THE HOUSE IT SEEMS TO 
IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE IF IT WAS DUE TO YOUR CATS 
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO GET RID OF THE CATS NO I DON'T BLAME YOU 
THE MOST COMMON ALLERGIC TRIGGER FOR ASTHMA IS ACTUALLY HOUSE DUST MITES REALLY YEAH 
BUT FROM WHAT YOU DESCRIBE IT COULD BE RELATED 
TO YOUR CATS IT'S NOT THE CATS THEMSELVES 
THAT PEOPLE ARE ALLERGIC TO IT'S ACTUALLY THEIR SPIT BECAUSE THEY PREEN THEMSELVES 
THE SPIT DRIES ON THEIR HAIR AND GETS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE 
THAT SETS OFF YOUR ASTHMA 
IF YOU TAKE A VERY SLIGHTLY DAMPENED SPONGE AND WIPE THEIR HAIR DOWN 
WITH IT EACH DAY 
THAT MAY REDUCE YOUR EXPOSURE TO THEIR SPIT 
AND THAT WAY YOU'D POTENTIALLY BE ABLE TO KEEP THE CATS 
AND NOT HAVE THE ASTHMA 
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EPISODES OF ASTHMA 
BECAUSE THEY CAN BE FATAL 
I'VE NOT HEARD OF THAT ONE BUT I'LL GIVE IT A GO 
SEE IF THE CAT'LL LET ME BRUSH HER DOWN WITH A DAMP CLOTH 
LOVELY TO ME YOU NICE TO MEET YOU I HOPE YOUR ASTHMA GET BETTER 
IT'S MID MORNING AND DOCTOR GEORGE IS AT THE LAST WORKING SLATE MINE IN ENGLAND 
IT'S HERE HE MEETS ONE OF THE OLDEST EMPLOYEES 
KNOWN FONDLY AS UNCLE JOHN 
ANY MEDICAL PROBLEMS ANYTHING YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU WITH 
WELL I HAVE GOT A VERY IFFY KNEE 
I GOT RUN OVER UP HERE A LOT OF YEARS AGO WITH A FORKLIFT TRUCK 
I SPENT THREE MONTHS IN CARLISLE 
WITH A TIBIA FIBULA AND A BLOOD CLOT RIGHT 
SO YOU WANT ME TO LOOK AT IT SIT YOURSELF DOWN HERE 
CAN YOU LIFT UP YOUR TROUSERS WE'LL HAVE A WEE DEKKO AT THAT 
OH YOU'VE GOT VARICOSE VEINS AS WELL AYE YEAH ABSOLUTELY 
CAN YOU ALSO LIFT UP THAT OTHER LEG JOHN THAT'S EXCELLENT 
YOU CERTAINLY HAVE QUITE SUBSTANTIVE VARICOSE VEINS 
NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT 
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO I'LL GET DOWN ON MY HAUNCHES 
WE'LL FLEX YOUR 
THAT'S NOT TOO BAD 
I'M FLEXING YOUR JOINT THERE ACTUALLY UNCLE JOHN 
AND THAT'S NOT TOO BAD 
WE'LL STRAIGHTEN IT AS WELL 
I CAN FEEL IT IN THE BACK HERE YOU CAN FEEL IT A LITTLE BIT IN THE BACK 
WHEN I'M STRAIGHTENING THE JOINT RIGHT 
NOW WHEN I PUSH THE JOINT IN NOT TOO BAD NOT TOO BAD NOT TOO BAD 
TO BE HONEST I THINK THERE'S A BIT OF DEGENERATION IN THAT JOINT 
WE'VE GOT ONE OF THOSE HINGES YOU MEAN OLD KNEES 
NO YOU'RE JUST A YOUNG GUY ACTUALLY 
NOW LOOK AT THIS 
IT'S A BIT LIKE A HINGE 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO MOVE IT BACK AND FORWARD BECAUSE OF THE RUST 
AND IF YOU'VE HAD A VERY BAD FRACTURE 
IT MAKES YOU MORE PRONE 
TO A BIT OF DEGENERATION LATER ON IN LIFE ALL RIGHT 
SOME PHYSIOTHERAPY WOULD HELP THAT ALSO SOMETIMES 
YOU GET SPECIAL PADS WHICH WILL PUT SOME HEAT TO THE JOINT 
AND WHAT HEAT DOES IS IT INCREASES THE BLOOD SUPPLY TO THIS AREA 
AND IT RELAXES THE MUSCLES ROUND ABOUT THE KNEE AND SO ON 
IT'S ALL COMMONSENSE ADVICE KEEP YOUR LEGS ELEVATED AT NIGHT 
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING THE TELEVISION WHICH HELPS VARICOSE VEINS AS WELL 
AND IF IT'S REALLY REALLY BAD 
SOME ANTI INFLAMMATORY TABLETS LIKE IBUPROFEN WILL SETTLE DOWN THE SYMPTOMS 
I HOPE THAT'S HELPFUL WHOLESOME ADVICE FOR YOU ALL THE BEST FOR YOUR FUTURE 
STILL AT THE HOTEL 
AND DOCTOR BARBARA COMES ACROSS BARRY 
A KITCHEN PORTER WHOSE HEALTH HAS GONE OFF THE BOIL 
HOW CAN I HELP YOU IT STARTED ABOUT A YEAR AGO 
I STARTED GETTING DIZZY SPELLS AND TIREDNESS AND STUFF LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME 
WHEN DO YOU GET THE DIZZY SPELLS 
IT OCCURS NOW AND AGAIN WHEN I'M WALKING DOWN THE STREET SOMETIMES LIKE THAT 
YOU GET A BIT LIGHT HEADED 
LIGHT HEADED O. K. AND HAVE YOU GOT ANY OTHER SYMPTOMS 
ANY COUGH ANY SORE THROAT ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
SOMETIMES MY HEAD FEELS LIKE DEAD TIGHT 
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE GOT TIGHTNESS IN YOUR SCALP 
AND PRESSURE IN YOUR EYES YEAH YEAH 
IS YOUR VISION O. K. ANY PROBLEM WITH YOUR VISION CAN YOU SEE O. K. 
YEAH I CAN SEE O. K. YEAH 
THERE'S A WHOLE GAMUT OF REASONS WHY PEOPLE GET TIRED 
SHIFT WORK TOP OF THE LIST SECONDLY WE'D NEED TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THERE ISN'T A CLINICAL REASON WHY YOU FEEL TIRED ALL THE TIME 
YOU COULD BE LACKING IN VITAMINS CAN I CHECK YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE 
THEN I'LL LISTEN TO YOUR HEART AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A THINK 
HAND ON YOUR CHEST O. K. 
NOW DON'T TALK FOR A SECOND WHILE WE JUST DO THIS 
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE'S UP A BIT FOR A YOUNG PERSON YEAH YEAH 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE OVER NINETY SEVEN THAT WOULD NEED TO BE REPEATED AGAIN 
AT YOUR DOCTOR'S JUST TO BE SURE 
I'M JUST LISTENING TO YOUR HEART AND IT'S QUITE REGULAR 
I CAN'T HEAR ANY MURMURS 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT THEN ISN'T IT 
BREATHE IN GOOD OUT GOOD 
CHEST NICE AND CLEAR 
I SUSPECT THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME BLOOD TESTS DONE 
JUST TO CHECK FOR EXAMPLE YOUR THYROID 
IF YOUR THYROID'S OVERACTIVE YOU CAN LOSE WEIGHT 
YOU CAN FEEL A BIT PANICKY AND ANXIOUS YEAH 
WHY DON'T I ARRANGE FOR YOU TO HAVE BLOOD TESTS AND THEN WE'LL TAKE IT FROM THERE 
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE YOU'LL SORT ANYTHING OUT O. K. BARRY CHEERS 
THE STREET DOCTORS HAVE ESCAPED THE CITY AND OPENED A PEAK PRACTICE IN THE LAKE DISTRICT 
AND THEY'RE REALLY CLOCKING UP THE MILES AS THEY MEET 
ARE YOU THE DOCTOR YEAH I'M JONTY I'M ONE OF THE STREET DOCTORS 
GREET SAY AARH 
AARGH 
N. THEIR OWN UNIQUE WAY 
YOU HOLD THAT END O. K. AND I'LL RUN ROUND YOU 
AT CONISTON WATER DOCTOR AYAN HAS MET THE CAPTAIN OF A STEAM GONDOLA WHO'S FEELING LESS THAN SHIP SHAPE 
CAN I HAVE WORD PLEASE WHILE YOU'RE HERE OF COURSE 
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU 
ABOUT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO I ACTUALLY FELL OFF MY BIKE 
AND I WAS WEARING A HELMET 
BUT I'VE DONE SOMETHING TO THE TOP OF THE JOINT ON MY LEG O. K. 
THE PAIN AT TIMES GETS SO UNCOMFORTABLE THAT IT ALMOST BRINGS ME TO TEARS 
DO YOU MIND IF I HAVE A CLOSER LOOK AT IT I DON'T MIND AT ALL 
WE CAN GO THROUGH THERE 
IT'S A BIT WARMER IN THERE THAN IT IS STOOD OUT HERE NIPPY ISN'T IT 
I'LL JUST GET YOU TO RAISE THAT LEG A MINUTE I'LL JUST POP THAT UP 
DOES THAT HURT ANYWHERE DOWN THE BACK OF THE LEG NO NO 
O. K. I'M JUST GOING TO BEND THE LEG HALF THE WAY 
WHAT ABOUT THAT THAT'S STARTING TO HURT 
WHEREABOUTS JUST THERE O. K. 
OFTEN IF YOU RAISE THE LEG A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL GET PAIN DOWN THE BACK 
FROM YOUR HAMSTRINGS BUT IF YOU BEND THE LEG 
THAT IS YOUR SCIATIC NERVE 
IT'S A NERVE THAT TENDS TO RUN 
DOWN YOU KNOW THE COURSE OF THE LEG 
AND IT TAKES A VERY TORTUOUS JOURNEY ACROSS THE PELVIS 
INTERESTINGLY CYCLISTS TEND TO SUFFER FROM THIS QUITE A LOT 
DO YOU DO A LOT OF CYCLING 
ON AVERAGE BETWEEN FOUR THOUSAND AND FIVE THOUSAND MILES A YEAR 
FOUR THOUSAND AND FIVE THOUSAND MILES YES ON A PUSH BIKE YES 
HATS OFF THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE IF AT ALL POSSIBLE 
YOU NEED TO CUT DOWN THE CYCLING 
THE ACTUAL NATURE OF THE EXERCISE ISN'T ONE THAT IS GOOD FOR SCIATICA 
THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT YOU OUGHT TO BE DOING 
THE FIRST IS BACK STRENGTHENING EXERCISES 
ONE OF THE ONES THAT PEOPLE OFTEN FORGET TO DO 
IS ACTUALLY TENSING YOUR ABDOMINAL MUSCLES 
COS THESE MUSCLES HERE ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT FOR YOUR BACK AS THE ONES BEHIND IT 
THE OTHER THING THAT CAN HELP IS SOMETHING CALLED 
THE NUMBER FOUR POSITION 
OFTEN IT'S BETTER IF YOU PUT THIS FOOT UP THERE 
REALLY STRETCHING THIS BIT OUT 
AND THAT SOMETIMES REALLY HELPS SCIATIC PAIN 
IN MOST CASES SCIATICA GETS BETTER ON ITS OWN IN ABOUT EIGHT WEEKS 
IF IT'S NOT GETTING BETTER AND YOU THINK I'VE TRIED THESE THINGS 
AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING BETTER IT IS WORTH 
GETTING REFERRED TO AN ORTHOPAEDIC SURGEON 
IS THAT ALL RIGHT THAT'S FINE NICE TALKING TO YOU AND YOU 
SO IT'S TEN SIT UPS EVERY MORNING IS IT YEAH 
TO PREVENT SCIATICA DOCTOR AYAN ADVISES 
STRETCHING AND EXERCISING MUSCLES THAT SUPPORT THE BACK 
WILL HELP EASE SCIATIC PAIN 
WATCH YOUR POSTURE 
SIT UPRIGHT WITH KNEES AND HIPS LEVEL AND YOUR FEET FLAT ON THE FLOOR 
WHEN IT'S TIME FOR BED USE A FIRM MATTRESS TO SUPPORT YOUR BODY 
AND KEEP YOUR NECK SUPPORTED BUT NOT AT A STEEP ANGLE 
IF YOU DO SUFFER WITH SCIATICA YOU COULD TRY TAKING A PAIN KILLER 
BUT IF THE SYMPTOMS PERSIST GO AND VISIT YOUR G. P. 
DOCTOR JONTY VENTURES INTO THE PICTURESQUE VILLAGE OF GRASMERE 
HOME OF WILLIAM WORDSWORTH 
ANYONE HERE NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR YOU O. K. 
HERE HE MEETS DIANE HER BOOTS MAY BE MADE FOR WALKING SO WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU 
MY POORLY LEGS 
BUT HER LEGS AREN'T 
I'VE GOT PAINS IN MY SHINS 
AND THE BACKS OF MY LEGS IT'S JUST REALLY REALLY PAINFUL 
WHERE IS IT IN THE LEG MAINLY POINT IT OUT TO ME 
IT'S UP THE SHIN THERE O. K. 
BUT IT'S WHEN I GET OUT OF BED IT'S TIGHT DOWN THE BACK THERE O. K. 
THE PAIN YOU GET AT THE FRONT SOUNDS TO ME MORE LIKE SHIN SPLINTS 
IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE WHO DO A LOT OF EXERCISE 
AND PARTICULARLY RUNNING 
THE USUAL ADVICE FOR SHIN SPLINTS IS JUST TO MAKE SURE 
THAT YOU REST UP DO LOWER IMPACT SPORTS 
NOW THE TIGHTNESS AT THE BACK HERE PARTICULARLY IF IT'S IN THE MORNING 
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN DOING ALL THIS WALKING THE BEST THING FOR THAT 
IS A FEW EXERCISES TO STRETCH OUT YOUR CALF IN THE MORNINGS 
BEFORE YOU GET UP LET'S DO SOME EXERCISES TO STRETCH YOUR CALF OUT 
WE COULD ALL DO THIS ARE YOU A WALKER AS WELL 
I AM A WALKER YOU WALK A BIT MORE OFTEN THOUGH 
YES WHAT DO YOU DO TO LIMBER UP 
I JUST KEEP GOING ALL DAY LONG DO YOU 
ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER 
AND WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS VERY GENTLY LET YOURSELF COME FORWARD 
GIVE IT A GOOD STRETCH PUSH FORWARD 
CAN YOU FEEL IT TIGHT ON THE BACK OF YOUR CALF YES 
AND THEN SWAP LEGS O. K. 
HOW'S THAT IT'S THE WORST ONE IS THAT THE WORST ONE 
GIVE IT A REALLY GOOD STRETCH THAT'S BETTER NOW 
IS IT FEELING A BIT BETTER NOT SO TIGHT 
JUST STRETCHING IT OUT LIKE THAT 
ALL RIGHT BETTER YEAH THANK YOU 
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO DURING THE NIGHT WHEN YOU REST 
THEY'LL TIGHTEN UP AGAIN SO YOU'VE GOT TO STRETCH THEM OUT 
BEFORE YOU HEAD OFF IN THE MORNINGS 
IS THAT ALL RIGHT YES THAT'S IF I CAN GET OUT OF BED FIRST YES 
I'VE STRETCHED YOU OUT A SHAME I CAN'T JOIN YOU I'VE GOT A COFFEE WAITING 
DOCTOR JONTY HE'S GOT WHITE TRAINERS ON WHEN HE'S IN THE LAKE DISTRICT 
YEAH YEAH ALL RIGHT 
I'D LOVE TO JOIN YOU WALKING UP A HILL 
SADLY I HAVEN'T GOT THE FOOTWEAR AS YOU'VE POINTED OUT 
DOCTOR BARBARA TAKES TIME OUT OF HER SURGERY TO CATCH UP WITH KAREN 
THE EX CONTORTIONIST TO GO THROUGH THE RESULTS OF HER SCAN 
ON THIS SCAN THE BONES ARE DARK AND THE FLUID IS PALE YES 
ALL THIS HERE IS FLUID THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE 
AND AROUND THIS BONE HERE 
THIS IS A SYNOVIAL AND IT'S THICKENED 
AND YOU SEE THESE LITTLE SORT OF PARTICLES WHICH WOULD STOP 
THE SMOOTH MOVEMENT OF YOUR KNEECAP ON THE ACTUAL FEMUR 
WHERE YOU HAVE FLUID IN A JOINT 
SOMEBODY REALLY NEEDS TO PUT A NEEDLE IN AND TAKE SOME OF THAT FLUID OUT 
AND FIND OUT WHETHER IT'S INFECTED 
OR WHETHER IT'S CAUSED BY AN INFLAMMATORY CONDITION 
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOU'VE GOT ANY SORT OF CHRONIC ARTHRITIS 
BUT IT DOES NEED TO BE LOOKED AT BY AN ORTHOPAEDIC SPECIALIST 
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
AND I'M SURE THAT IT'S EMINENTLY TREATABLE 
YEAH WELL I'LL TAKE YOUR ADVICE ON THAT 
AND I'M SO GLAD THAT I'VE MET YOU IN THE LAKE DISTRICT 
AND YOU'VE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO PINPOINT WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY KNEE 
AND I'LL OBVIOUSLY ACT ON THE ADVICE THAT YOU'VE JUST BEEN GIVING ME 
GOOD EXCELLENT LOVELY TO MEET YOU 
THE LAKE DISTRICT ATTRACTS OVER FIFTEEN MILLION VISITORS A YEAR 
AND DOCTOR AYAN MEETS ONE OF THEM FOR A LAKESIDE CONSULTATION 
NICE TO SEE YOU CAN I HELP YOU WITH ANYTHING TODAY 
YES IT'S JUST THIS SKIN THING I'VE GOT HERE IT'S LIKE 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CALL IT A DIMPLE A PIMPLE 
A DIMPLE OR A PIMPLE O. K. 
AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD IT 
WELL I'VE HAD IT I THINK ALL MY LIFE 
BUT I'VE RECENTLY STARTED TOUCHING IT 
AND SO I THINK I'VE IRRITATED IT 
O. K. SO LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
OOH 
O. K. HAS THAT ALWAYS BEEN BLACK 
YES IT'S ALWAYS BEEN BLACK THE SAME COLOUR 
WHEN DID IT START TO GO RED 
I THINK A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO YEAH YEAH A FEW DAYS AGO 
I KEEP MOVING IT AND TOUCHING IT'S HORRIBLE 
I'M REALLY WORRIED THAT IT'S CANCEROUS 
O. K. THERE MIGHT BE A TINY TINY BIT OF PUS IN THERE OR SOMETHING 
WITH THAT SKIN TAG 
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANYTHING SINISTER 
IT'S NOT CANCER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
THE RED BIT IS A LITTLE BIT OF INFECTION 
THAT'S JUST OCCURRED WITHIN THE SKIN SO I THINK 
I OUGHT TO PRESCRIBE YOU A CREAM WITH AN ANTIBIOTIC IN IT 
WHICH I WANT YOU TO PUT ON THERE TWICE A DAY 
ONCE THAT'S CLEARED I WOULD SUGGEST IT'S BEST IF YOU GO 
TO YOUR DOCTOR AND ARRANGE FOR THAT TO GET REMOVED 
BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT UNTIL THE INFECTION IS GONE 
THANK YOU NO WORRIES NO PROBLEMS THANK YOU 
WHILST DOCTOR AYAN CONTINUES TO BRAVE THE WINDS OF WINDERMERE 
DOCTOR BARBARA HEADS TO THE TOWN OF KENDAL WHERE SHE MEETS A WOMAN WITH A RECURRING PROBLEM 
I'VE GOT PINS AND NEEDLES IN MY LEFT HAND 
I'VE HAD IT FOR TWO OR THREE WEEKS WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING JANE 
I WORK FOR AN ACCOUNTANT'S FIRM ON A COMPUTER A LOT DOING LOTS OF THIS 
ALL THE TIME CAN I LOOK AT YOUR WRIST 
HAVE YOU GOT PINS AND NEEDLES NOW 
A LITTLE BIT YES STRETCH YOUR HAND BACK A BIT 
I'M JUST GOING TO TAP ON YOUR WRIST 
CAN YOU FEEL ANYTHING WHEN I DO THAT 
YEAH I CAN FEEL IT 
TINGLING THROUGH YEAH 
I THINK I KNOW WHAT IT IS I THINK YOU'VE GOT CARPAL TUNNEL JANE OH RIGHT 
WHAT IT IS IS THERE'S A NERVE HERE CALLED THE MEDIAN NERVE 
IT COMES DOWN HERE AND IT GOES THROUGH A LITTLE TUNNEL OF BONES 
CALLED THE CARPAL BONES RIGHT 
AND THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THERE THERE'S A SHEATH 
THROUGH WHICH THE NERVE COMES AND IT COMES DOWN TO THESE FINGERS HERE 
I'VE GOT THE SAME PROBLEM 
SO I'M GIVING YOU THE BENEFIT OF MY EXPERIENCE NO W. 
FIRST OF ALL A WRIST SUPPORT RIGHT 
WHAT YOU WANT IS ONE THAT YOU CAN VELCRO OVER 
SO THAT YOU HAVEN'T GOT PRESSURE 
BUT YOU HAVE NO FLEXIBILITY IN YOUR WRIST BUT YOU CAN MOVE YOUR FINGERS 
I THINK I'VE SEEN THEM YEAH NOW THEY'RE IDEAL 
THEN AFTER THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOCAL CORTISONE INJECTION 
WHICH REALLY WORKS LASTS FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS 
RIGHT THEN AFTER THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
A SURGICAL PROCEDURE WHICH IS A LITTLE INCISION THERE 
AND OPEN IT UP AND JUST DIVIDE THE SHEATH 
AND THEN THAT RELEASES THE PRESSURE ON IT 
YOU'VE GOT A POSITIVE SIGN 
THAT TEST IS CALLED TINEL'S TEST 
SO I'M ALMOST CERTAIN THAT'S WHAT IT IS I'M GLAD I CAME DOWN 
I SHALL TRY TRY THE WRIST SUPPORT FIRST YEAH 
OH WELL NICE TO MEET YOU JANE THANKS VERY MUCH 
THE LAKE DISTRICT IS PROVIDING OUR DOCTORS WITH PLENTY OF FRESH AIR AND PLENTY OF PATIENTS 
HANG ON HANG ON THAT'S MY SIGN 
AND FOR ONE OF OUR DOCTORS POSSIBLY A NEW PROFESSION 
YOU CAN SAY GOODBYE TO THIS I'VE GOT A NEW JOB 
WHILST DOCTOR AYAN IS FULFILLING HIS BOYHOOD DREAM 
DOCTOR JONTY IS ASKED FOR ADVICE BY A WORRIED MUM 
SO TELL ME A BIT ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING WITH YOUNG KYLE 
HE'S RECENTLY HAD CHICKENPOX 
HE DIDN'T COME OUT IN A LOT EIGHT OR NINE OVER HIS BODY 
SINCE WE GOT HERE YESTERDAY 
HE'S JUST NOT HIMSELF AND HE'S REALLY SHIVERING TODAY 
I CAN SEE HE'S GOT A SLIGHTLY RUNNY NOSE THERE 
HAVEN'T YOU YOUNG MAN YES 
GIVEN THAT HE'S BEEN QUITE SHIVERY 
WHAT I WANT TO DO IS TAKE HIS TEMPERATURE 
ALSO JUST HAVE A LISTEN TO HIS LUNGS AND PERHAPS CHECK IN HIS EARS 
GREAT IS THAT ALL RIGHT 
YEAH THAT'S FINE THANKS 
KYLE HOW OLD ARE YOU THREE AND A HALF AREN'T YOU 
ARE YOU THREE AND A HALF FANTASTIC 
O. K. LET'S JUST CHECK HIS TEMPERATURE THEN I'VE GOT MY THERMOMETER HERE 
CAN I POP THIS IN ONE OF YOUR EARS 
WHICH ONE IT JUST GOES IN 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL SHOW ON MUMMY FIRST 
HERE DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A LOOK THERE YOU GO THERE WE GO 
SHALL WE HAVE A GO ON MUMMY THAT TICKLES 
THERE WE GO NOW IS IT KYLE'S GO 
KYLE'S TURN NOW KYLE'S TURN NOW HERE WE GO 
AND WHAT A CLEVER BOY WELL DONE 
CLEVER BOY WELL DONE AREN'T YOU CLEVER 
YEAH SO YOU CAN SEE HIS TEMPERATURE'S UP THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE 
SO HE HAS GOT A FEVER AT THE MOMENT 
DOCTOR JONTY WANTS TO FIND OUT IF KYLE HAS ANY OTHER SYMPTOMS 
SO HE LISTENS TO HIS CHEST BACK AND EXAMINES HIS THROAT 
JUST KEEP IT THERE FOR ONE SECOND OPEN WIDE WIDE WIDE AS YOU CAN 
YEAH THAT'S GREAT 
AND THEN YOU CLOSE YOUR MOUTH 
ARE YOU PLAYING WITH ME 
I THINK YOU ARE TO BE HONEST MUM HE'S DEFINITELY GOT A VIRAL INFECTION AT THE BACK OF HIS THROAT 
BUT HIS OWN IMMUNE SYSTEM WILL FIGHT THAT OFF ALL RIGHT 
GIVE HIM PARACETAMOL EVERY SIX HOURS TO KEEP ON TOP OF THE TEMPERATURE 
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO DO 
IT'S BEEN VERY NICE TO MEET YOU ARE YOU GOING TO SHAKE MY HAND 
ARE YOU GOING TO SAY GOODBYE O. K. GIVE ME FIVE 
GIVE ME FIVE WAHEY 
IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT A CHILD WITH A VIRAL INFECTION DOCTOR JONTY ADVISES 
ENCOURAGE THEM TO DRINK PLENTY OF WATER 
HAVING A FEVER WILL CAUSE LOSS OF BODY FLUID 
AND PUT THEM AT RISK OF DEHYDRATION 
GIVE THEM REGULAR PARACETAMOL OR IBUPROFEN 
TO KEEP THEIR TEMPERATURE DOWN 
YOUR PHARMACIST CAN ADVISE YOU ON THE CORRECT DOSAGE 
FINALLY MINIMISE THEIR CONTACT WITH OTHER CHILDREN 
TO AVOID PASSING INFECTION ON 
IF THEIR TEMPERATURE REMAINS HIGH CONSULT YOUR G. P. 
THE SUN IS ALMOST SETTING OVER THE LAKES WHEN DOCTOR GEORGE MEETS WILL 
WHO HAS A MEDICAL MYSTERY HE WANTS SOLVING 
I LOST MY LEG TWO YEARS AGO DUE TO BONE CANCER 
AND I GET PHANTOM SENSATION TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY 
BUT THE PHANTOM PAIN IS CRIPPLING 
IT'S LIKE ONE THOUSAND VOLTS THROUGH MY FOOT 
AND NOBODY REALLY SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO GIVE ME ANY SOLUTION TO IT 
WHAT I CAN DO IS I CAN SHOW YOU WHERE THE PAIN IS IF YOU WISH O. K. 
IF YOU WOULD WANT TO DO THAT NO PROBLEM AT ALL 
THIS IS MY SOCKET LINER WHICH HOLDS MY LEG ON BASICALLY 
SO THIS IS HOW MUCH OF MY LEG I'VE GOT LEFT AND 
RIGHT AND YOU'RE EXPERIENCING THE PAIN DOWN HERE YEAH 
RIGHT WHICH IS A NEURALGIC TYPE PAIN 
AS IF IT'S AN ELECTRIC SHOCK AND OF COURSE 
THE REASON FOR THAT WILL IS THAT 
IT'S WELL KNOWN WITHIN MEDICINE THAT FOR EXAMPLE 
IF A PAIN IS BEING STIMULATED EVEN FOR EXAMPLE IN SCIATICA 
YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THE PAIN AT THE TIP OF THE TOE 
THE FACT THAT THE NERVE IS STILL THERE AT ITS ORIGIN 
MEANS THAT THE NERVE CAN STILL GIVE THE SENSATION 
THAT THERE'S PAIN DOWN IN YOUR LEG 
YOU MUST HAVE HAD SOME SORT OF TREATMENT FOR IT 
I'M CURRENTLY ON TWO DIFFERENT NERVE SUPPRESSANT DRUGS I THINK ONE'S CALLED AMITRIPTYLINE 
AND IT TENDS TO HOLD IT BACK UNTIL I GET TIRED YES 
AS I GET TIRED THE MORE PAIN I GET RIGHT THE TREATMENT THAT YOU'RE ON 
IS THE SORT OF TREATMENT THAT WE WOULD GIVE FOR PAIN CONTROL 
AND PARTICULARLY FOR NEURALGIC TYPE PAINS 
WHAT I THINK IS HAPPENING IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE GETTING A BIT TIRED 
YOUR BODY BATTERY'S ALMOST REDUCING THAT BIT 
IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED IN THE PAST AS A WALL 
AND AS I GET TIRED THAT WALL LOWERS 
THE WALL LOWERS THE THRESHOLD IS 
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING YOU'RE LOWERING THE THRESHOLD 
THE STIMULUS IS STILL COMING IN AND IF YOU LOWER THE THRESHOLD 
TO WITHSTAND THE PAIN THEN IT HITS THE RAW NERVE 
I THINK THAT WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO BE WORKING ON 
IS TO TRY AND NOT DROP THAT IMMUNE SYSTEM 
SO THAT YOU DO NOT GET OVERTIRED AND POSSIBLY 
BRING IN WAYS OF BEING ABLE TO RELAX 
SO IT'S NOT EASY 
BUT IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE AND I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST 
I THINK YOU'RE A VERY BRAVE YOUNG MAN THANK YOU 
THE DOCTORS' DAY IN THE LAKE DISTRICT IS DRAWING TO AN END 
BUT WHAT ARE THEIR THOUGHTS ON LIFE IN THE LAKES 
I'VE SEEN LOTS OF INTERESTING CASES IN THE LAKE DISTRICT 
ONE WAS A GUY CALLED JOHN REALLY BAD SCIATICA THAT'S FLARED UP 
AFTER AN ACCIDENT WHERE HE FELL OFF HIS BIKE 
HE CYCLES FIVE THOUSAND MILES A YEAR WHICH I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE 
I GAVE HIM SOME POINTERS HOPEFULLY HE'LL BE BETTER CYCLING'S FANTASTIC FOR HIS HEALTH 
IF IT'S MAKING HIS SCIATICA WORSE THAT'S DIFFICULT ISN'T IT 
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT I WENT TO THE LAST WORKING SLATE MINE IN ENGLAND 
AND I SAW THIS LARGER THAN LIFE CHARACTER A GUY CALLED UNCLE JOHN HE HAD A PROBLEM WITH HIS KNEE 
HOPEFULLY WITH THE ADVICE I GAVE HIM THINGS WILL MOVE FORWARD PROPERLY THAT'S GREAT 
AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE HE GAVE ME THIS FROM THE SLATE MINE 
ISN'T THAT ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC THAT'S BEAUTIFUL 
SINCE THE STREET DOCTORS' VISIT TO THE LAKE DISTRICT 
BARRY'S BLOOD TESTS REVEALED HIS DIZZY SPELLS WERE DUE TO A LACK OF FOLIC ACID 
TO BOOST HIS LEVELS HE'S EATING MORE GREENS AND FEELING MUCH BETTER 
ANYA KEPT UP WITH HER A. B. C.'S AND NOW ENJOYS PAIN FREE RUNNING 
AND YOUNG KYLE IS ON THE MEND 
AND HE'LL SOON BE FEELING AS BRIGHT AS A BUTTON
