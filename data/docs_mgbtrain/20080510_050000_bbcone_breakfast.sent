MOTOR RACING KRAYS AND OVERWEIGHT 
BINGE DRINKING CAN THIS REALLY BE 
THE TRUE PICTURE OF ENGLAND OUR 
MAIN STORIES THERE ARE WARNINGS 
THAT MORE PEOPLE COULD DIE IN BURMA 
A CLONE UNLESS INCREASED AID 
SUPPLIES ARE DELIVERED SOON 
STAFF PLANNING TO ACCOMPANY AID 
CARGOES ARE STILL WAITING FOR 
BURMESE VISAS THE SIGNS AT LAST 
THAT THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT COULD 
BE RESPONDING TO THE PRESSURE TO 
ALLOW MORE FOREIGN SUPPLIES INTO 
THE COUNTRY THE WORLD FOOD 
PROGRAMME SAYS IT HAS BEEN GIVEN 
CLEARANCE FOR THREE MORE AID 
FLIGHTS TO FLY IN TODAY THEY HAD 
ONLY BEEN ALLOWED TO SEND FOUR IN 
THE PREVIOUS WEEK BUT THERE IS 
STILL NO SIGN THAT THE BUREAUCRACY 
IS BEING LIFTED APPLYING FOR 
VISAS REMAINS A SLOW PROCESS WE 
HAVE APPLIED FOR A SIX TEAMS SO FAR 
IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE 
CYCLONE AND ONLY ONE HAS BEEN 
GRANTED SO FAR 
IT IS IMMENSELY FRUSTRATING 
WORKING BY REMOTE CONTROL FROM THE 
COUNTRY NEXT DOOR IT IS TO WOBBLE 
BUT IT PUTS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF 
STRAIN ON OUR STAFF ALREADY IN THE 
FIELD IT IS DOABLE IN THE 
MEANTIME THE PEOPLE WHO COULD DO 
WHATEVER THEY CAN TO SURVIVE THIS THIS LOW LYING REGION BORE THE BRUNT OF 
THE STORM IT SHOULD BE THE FOCUS 
OF A HUGE AID OPERATION BUT WHAT 
IS GETTING ON IS JUST A DROP IN THE 
OCEAN OF WHAT IS NEEDED GETTING 
IN STAGE MANAGED PHOTO CALLS ON 
STAKED ONE TELEVISION SHOW A 
GOVERNMENT IN CONTROL OF THE CRISIS 
BUT EXPERTS SAY THIS CRISIS IS TOO 
VAST TO BE HANDLED ALONE ON 
STATE RUN TELEVISION DESPITE 
WORLDWIDE CALLS TO POSTPONE A VOTE 
THE GOVERNMENT IS CONTINUING WITH 
PLANS FOR CHANGES THAT WOULD 
FURTHER STRENGTHEN THE JUNTA'S GRIP 
ON POWER PUSHING THE REST OF THE 
WORLD EVEN FURTHER AWAY 
THOUSANDS OF PUPILS WILL BE 
CRAMMING IN THEIR REVISION THIS 
WEEKEND AS THE SCHOOL EXAM SEASON 
IS ABOUT TO KICK OFF ACROSS ENGLAND 
WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND IT'S A 
DIFFICULT TIME BUT TEACHING UNIONS 
SAY IT IS BEING MADE WORSE BY WHAT 
THEY CALL THE EXAM CONGESTION SOME 
PUPILS WILL HAVE TO SPEND UP TO 
SEVEN HOURS SITTING THREE OR FOUR 
EXAMS IN A SINGLE DAY THE NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION OF HEAD TEACHERS HAS 
SAID THE PROBLEM IS GETTING WORSE 
THEY SAY EXAM BOARDS NEED TO CO 
ORDINATE THEIR SCHEDULES BETTER 
WITH THE MAIN EXAM SEASON STARTING 
ON MONDAY STRESS LEVELS IN SCHOOLS 
ARE RATCHETING UP BUT IT HAS BEEN 
MADE WORSE THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO 
TEACHING UNIONS BY EXAM CONGESTION 
HAS WITH PUPILS HAVING THEIR EXAMS 
CRAMMED TOGETHER IN MANY CASES 
EVEN CLASHING STUDENTS ARE NOW 
STUDYING MORE SUBJECTS THAT MEANS 
MORE EXAMS AND MORE MODULES AT 
THIS TIME STUDENTS CAN BE SITTING 
IN EXAMINATIONS FOR UP TO SEVEN 
HOURS A DAY THESE A LEVEL STUDENTS 
HAVE EXAMS SO TIGHTLY PACKED THEY 
BELIEVE THEIR RESULTS WILL BE 
AFFECTED I'VE GOT WEDNESDAY 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY NINE EXAMS 
WITHIN THREE DAYS 
BY THE TIME YOU 
HAVE GOT YOUR LAST SUBJECT YOU 
FEEL YOU ARE PUTTING YOUR LESS 
EFFORT THAN YOU WERE AT THE 
BEGINNING 
YOU ARE PUTTING IN BEGINNING LESS EFFORT 
PUPILS THAT HAVE GOT THEIR TIME 
TABLE MORE SPREAD OUT THEY HAVE 
MORE OF AN ADVANTAGE WE'RE FINDING 
THAT WE ARE GETTING A REAL BUNCHING 
OF EXAMS IN ONE DAY SO THAT 
STUDENTS CAN BE SITTING THREE EXAMS 
IN ONE DAY AND THIS HAS THE EFFECT 
OF MAKING THEM MENTALLY EXHAUSTED 
BY THE LAST EXAM WHICH MAY AFFECT 
THEIR FINAL GRADE 
TEACHING UNIONS 
SAID THE LOCKED GEM OF EXAMS IS 
GETTING WORSE WHICH IS CAUSING 
UNACCEPTABLE STRESS LEVELS IN 
PUPILS 
THE LOG JAM THE EXAM PUPILS BOARDS NEED TO DO MORE SO THAT 
YOUNGSTERS DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM 
OF THREE OR FOUR EXAMINATIONS IN 
ONE DAY WHICH IS CLEARLY ASKING 
TOO MUCH OF ANYBODY 
IT CANNOT 
ENCOURAGE BEST PERFORMANCE BY THEM 
THE EXAM BODIES' ORGANISATION SAYS 
IT HAS A DIFFICULT JOB TRYING TO 
ORGANISE THE SCHEDULES BUT IT SAYS 
THEY TAKE INTO DE THEY TAKE INTO 
CONSIDERATION THE EFFECT 
THE EXAM LOG JAM IS LIKELY TO GET 
EVEN WORSE NEXT YEAR AS NEW AND 
OLD A LEVEL SYSTEMS OVERLAP 
EXAM CONGESTION AND STRESS LEVELS 
IN MAY AND JUNE WILL CONTINUE TO 
RISE THERE IS GROWING CONCERN THAT 
LEBANON COULD SLIDE BACK INTO CIVIL 
WAR WAR GUNMEN FROM THE SHIA HEZBOLLAH 
MILITIA NOW CONTROL MOST OF WEST 
BEIRUT AT LEAST ELEVEN PEOPLE WERE 
KILLED AND DOZENS WERE INJURED IN 
VIOLENCE ARAB LEADERS ARE GOING TO 
HOLD AN EMERGENCY MEETING ON THE 
CRISIS TOMORROW TONY BLAIR IS 
ADVISING GORDON BROWN ON HOW TO WIN 
THE NEXT ELECTION ACCORDING TO 
CHERIE BLAIR WHOSE AUTOBIOGRAPHY 
IS BEING SERIALISED IN THE TIMES 
NEWSPAPER FROM TODAY SHE SUGGESTS 
MR. BROWN WAS RATTLING THE KEYS OF 
DOWNING STREET OVER TONY BLAIR'S 
HEAD IN THE HOPE OF GETTING HIM 
OUT OF OFFICE BEFORE THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
ELECTION SHE HAS NEVER BEEN AFRAID 
TO SPEAK HER MIND AND NOW CHERIE 
BLAIR HAS REVEALED THAT LOVE HATE 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HER HUSBAND 
AND THE MAN WHO USED TO LIVE NEXT 
DOOR DOOR NOT OFTEN WE GET SOMETHING FOR 
FREE 
IN TODAY'S TIMES NEWSPAPER FREE CHERIE BLAIR DISCLOSES THAT TONY 
BLAIR IS IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH 
THE PRIME MINISTER AND IS GIVING 
HIM ADVICE ON HOW TO WIN THE NEXT 
ELECTION SHE SAYS 
HOWEVER SHE ALSO CLAIMS THAT HER 
HUSBAND MIGHT HAVE STOOD DOWN IN 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE BUT FOR THE FACT THAT HE FELT 
GORDON BROWN WAS TRYING TO PUSH HIM 
OUT OF OFFICE MRS. BLAIR HAS CHOSEN 
TO GIVE HER ACCOUNT OF THE BLAIR 
BROWN YEARS NOW BECAUSE HER 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS BEING PUBLISHED 
NEXT WEEK HER ANTIPATHY TOWARDS 
GORDON BROWN HAS BEEN ONE OF 
WESTMINSTER'S WORST KEPT SECRETS 
AND SOMETHING OF A STANDING JOKE 
AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY 
ABOUT HER RUNNING OFF WITH THE 
BLOKE NEXT DOOR 
BUT LAST NIGHT 
CHERIE BLAIR'S PUBLISHERS INSISTED 
THE DECISION TO BRING THE 
PUBLICATION FORWARD WAS NOT AN 
ATTEMPT TO ADD TO GORDON BROWN'S 
CURRENT WOES 
THEY SAID IT HAPPENED 
BECAUSE THE BOOK WAS FINISHED EARLY 
DOWNING STREET CONFIRMED THAT THE 
TWO MEANT TO TALK REGULARLY THE 
TWO MEM DO TALK REGULARLY MEN 
DO THESE COMMENTS FROM CHERIE BLAIR 
MAKE GORDON BROWN NERVOUS L. THINK 
THEY PROBABLY DO GORDON BROWN IS A 
PRETTY VORACIOUS READER I AM NOT 
SURE IF THIS BOOK IS GOING TO BE ON 
HIS LIST 
IT IS A REMINDER OF THE 
PROBLEMS THAT THERE WERE BETWEEN 
THE TWO OF THEM WHEN TONY BLAIR WAS 
IN OFFICE ALSO OF SOME OF THOSE 
CRITICISMS OF GORDON BROWN AT THE 
TIME THE WAY THAT HE WAS 
UNDERMINING THE PRIME MINISTER NOT 
FULLY BEHIND SOME OF THE PUBLIC 
SERVICE REFORMS THAT HE WAS MAKING 
LIFE QUITE DIFFICULT WE KNOW THAT 
CHERIE BLAIR AND GORDON BROWN 
DIDN'T GET ON THIS IS ONLY THE 
FIRST STAGE OF THE SERIALISATION I 
AM SURE CHERIE BLAIR HAS GOT A LOT 
MORE TO SAY BUT THAT TALK ABOUT 
DANGLING THE KEYS OVER THE ROOF OF 
DOWNING STREET AND ALL THAT KIND OF 
THING I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE 
SOMEWHAT UNCOMFORTABLE FOR GORDON 
BROWN SOMEONE ELSE MAKING LIFE 
UNCOMFORTABLE FOR HIM THIS MORNING 
MIGHT BE IVAN LEWIS A JUNIOR 
MINISTER SAYING THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT SHOULD APOLOGISE FOR 
MISTAKES THAT IT HAS MADE SINCE 
GORDON BROWN TO COVER 
WHAT IS HE 
DOING HERE IS NOT THE FIRST ONE 
ACTUALLY TO THE SAYING THAT THERE 
NEED TO BE APOLOGIES MADE AND 
INDEED APOLOGIES HAVE BEEN MADE 
IVAN LEWIS IT WAS ONLY ABOUT A 
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WHEN HE MADE 
SIMILAR SORT OF SUGGESTIONS 
WARNING ABOUT PROBLEMS FOR LABOUR 
HIS THE M. P. FOR BURY BURY FELT THE 
CONSERVATIVES AT THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS SO HE IS QUITE CONCERNED 
HE IS THE M. P. IT WAS JACK STRAW 
WHO INITIALLY APOLOGISED FOR THE 
TEN P. INCOME TAX BAND AND THE CHANGES 
THERE AND WHAT IVAN LEWIS SEEMS TO 
BE SAYING IS THAT THEY NEED TO GO 
BEYOND THAT AND GIVE BLANKET 
APOLOGY AND ALMOST HAVE A FRESH 
START RECONNECT WITH VOTERS 
CAN'T REALLY SEE THAT GORDON BROWN 
IS GOING TO BE HAPPY TO SAY ALL 
THE WORK WE HAVE DONE OVER THE LAST 
FEW MONTHS NEEDS TO BE APOLOGISED 
FOR SO HE CLEARLY FEELS THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO HAVE A FRESH 
START BUT I AM NOT SURE GORDON 
BROWN WILL BE FOLLOWING HIS ADVICE 
THE SELLING TACTICS OF ONE OF 
BRITAIN'S BIGGEST ENERGY COMPANIES 
HAVE BEEN STRONGLY CRITICISED 
ENERGYWATCH SAYS THE COMPANY MUST 
STAMP OUT THE WIDESPREAD MIS 
SELLING OF ITS DOOR TO DOOR SALES 
TEAM THE COMPANY HAS DISMISSED A 
HANDFUL OF AGENTS AFTER A NEWSPAPER 
INVESTIGATION BREAKFAST HAS 
DISCOVERED THOSE ARE NOT ISOLATED 
INCIDENTS 
SEVEN HUNDRED COUPLES WITH A COMBINED TOTAL 
OF MORE THAN FORTY THREE THOUSAND YEARS OF 
MARRIAGE WILL BE CELEBRATING THEIR 
WEDDING ANNIVERSARIES AT A SPECIAL 
MASS AT WESTMINSTER CATHEDRAL TODAY 
THE ARCHBISHOP OF THE DIOCESE 
CARDINAL MURPHY O'CONNOR INVITED 
HUSBANDS AND WIVES TO ATTEND TWENTY NINE OF 
THEM HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR MORE 
THAN SIXTY YEARS CARDINAL CORMAC 
MURPHY O'CONNOR THAT'S A LOOK AT 
OUR TOP STORIES IT IS JUST COMING 
UP TO TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX NOW OUR 
TOP STORIES GETTING ESSENTIAL AID 
TO THE SURVIVORS OF THE CYCLONE IN 
BURMA HAS BEEN A PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE 
TASK SO FAR FOR MANY AGENCIES SAVE 
THE CHILDREN WHICH ALREADY HAS 
STAFF IN THE COUNTRY SAYS THE 
PROBLEMS SHOULD NOT PEOPLE SHOULD 
NOT PUT PEOPLE OFF MAKING DONATIONS 
GOOD MORNING IT MUST BE A 
DESPERATE SITUATION FOR YOU SEEING 
WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE BURMA AND 
THEN SEEING THE AID BEING HELD UP 
TRICKLING IN BUT MAINLY STAFF BEING 
HELD UP AT THE BORDERS HOW YOU 
TACKLING THAT WE DO ACTUALLY HAVE 
TO MY CREW PEOPLE FLYING IN TODAY 
WE GOT VISAS FROM THE LONDON 
EMBASSY 
AND YOU WOULD HAVE EMBASSY EXPECTED HOW MANY PEOPLE TO BE IN 
THEIR BY NOW BY NOW OVER TWENTY I 
WOULD IMAGINE THERE BUT TWO 
WILL GET IN TODAY AND YES THE 
AD'S TRICKLING IN BUT WE'RE STILL 
GETTING TO THOSE PEOPLE WE HAVE 
NOT BEEN STOPPED AND THAT IS 
POSITIVE THE AID IS TRICKLING IN 
AS YOU RIGHTLY SAID WE DON'T WANT 
TO STOP PEOPLE GIVING BECAUSE AT 
SOME POINT WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET 
IN PEOPLE MUST FEEL ALTHOUGH THEY 
WANT TO GIVE WHAT IS THE POINT OF 
GIVING IF THAT MONEY IS GOING IN TO 
AID THAT SIMPLY CAN'T GET TO THE 
PEOPLE WHO NEED IT UNFORTUNATELY UNFORTUNATELY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT THE 
LONGER THAT WE HAVE TO WAIT TO GO 
IN THERE WAS THE SITUATION IS 
GOING TO GET THE DIARRHOEA THE 
DISEASES THE CHOLERA THE THREAT 
OF MALARIA IS ALL THERE BECAUSE OF 
THE FLOODING PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
LIVING OUTSIDE FOR TEN DAYS NOW 
WITHOUT SHELTER THIS CAUSES ALL 
SORTS OF PROBLEMS AND THEY WILL BE 
ABSOLUTELY ESCALATED IF WE CANNOT 
GET IN WHEN WE GET IN WE BELIEVE 
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO BE ABLE 
TO ASSIST THOSE PEOPLE WHERE DO 
YOU THINK THE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS 
ARE FROM WHAT YOU CAN SEE WITH 
PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY IN HOW CAN 
YOU ANALYSE IT SHELTER IS 
ABSOLUTELY THE MAIN PROP THEM YOU 
CAN'T LIVE OUTSIDE FOR A LENGTH OF 
TIME WITH THAT AMOUNT OF WATER 
AROUND 
THE MAIN PROBLEM HEALTH AROUND ISSUES ARE GOING TO COME UP VERY 
QUICKLY AND SEVERELY ESPECIALLY 
WITH CHILDREN UNDER FIVE THEIR 
IMMUNE SYSTEMS CANNOT COPE WITH 
THESE SORTS OF CONDITIONS WE HEARD 
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER 
SUGGESTING THAT TIME MIGHT BE CLOSE 
FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO 
DROP AID NOT TO WAIT FOR VISAS 
DOES THAT PRESENT A PROBLEM FOR YOU 
THAT SORT OF SOLUTION HAVING 
AIRDROPS IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE 
NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO 
DROP YOU HAVE TO PREPARE DROP 
ZONES YOU NEED A LOT OF PEOPLE 
NEED COMMUNITIES TO BE PART OF THAT 
NEED PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE 
NOT ALLOWED TO JUST RUN ON TO THE 
AIRSTRIPS THE WHOLE POINT OF THAT 
DISTRIBUTION CAN BE HAMPERED IF 
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SYSTEM 
IS SO AIRDROPS ARE NOT YOU 
CANNOT JUST DROP AND DELIVER THERE 
IS A WHOLE PROCESS THAT GOES ON 
SO IN THE MEANTIME YOU WAIT FOR THE 
BUREAUCRACY TO LIFT 
AIRDROPS WOULD 
BE THE LAST RESORT 
YOU 
ARE WATCHING BREAKFAST THERE ARE WARNINGS THAT MORE PEOPLE COULD 
DIE IN BURMA UNLESS INCREASED AID

GETS TOUGH WITH NPOWER AFTER 
CUSTOMERS COMPLAINED ABOUT MIS

THOUGHT WE HAVE SEEN A WEEK'S GOOD 
WEATHER AND IT IS GOING TO 
CONTINUE ONE OR TWO FLY IN THE 
OINTMENTS THERE WILL BE SOME 
THUNDER AROUND AND SOME ISOLATED 
SHOWERS PARTICULARLY THE FURTHER 
NORTH YOU ARE THE CLOUD SHOULD 
BREAK UP AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
SEE SOME SUNNY SPELLS ALSO SOME 
SHARP SHOWERS JUST LEAVING WALES AS 
WE SPEAK BUT MOVING ACROSS THE 
IRISH SEA SOME OF THOSE QUITE 
HEAVY AND POSSIBLY THUNDERY AS WELL 
THERE WILL BE SOME SHOWERS THROUGH 
NORTHERN IRELAND AND SOME OF THESE 
WILL MIGRATE ACROSS THE SEAT ONCE 
AGAIN INTO SCOTLAND FOR THE REST OF 
THE AFTERNOON IT IS AN OVERCAST 
START HERE BUT A MILD ONE AND SIXTEEN 
DEGREES IN GLASGOW A LITTLE BIT IN 
THE WAY OF LOW CLOUD THE FURTHER 
EAST YOU GET BUT IT WILL BE A 
PLEASANT ONE START IN LONDON AT EIGHTEEN 
DEGREES AT TEN A M. MAYBE THE CLOUD IS 
CLINGING ON TO THE FAR WEST OF 
WALES FOR SOME TIME BUT IMPROVING 
CONDITIONS AS THE DAY PROGRESSES 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE THE RESCUE 
IF RISK OF THUNDERY SHOWERS 
THERE IS MORE CLOUD AROUND 
GENERALLY BUT IT IS STILL QUITE 
WARM TWENTY SEVEN DEGREES IS EIGHTY ONE FAHRENHEIT 
WARM TWENTY SEVEN DEGREES IS EIGHTY ONE FAHRENHEIT IN THE SOUTH EAST CORNER THE 
WEATHER IS NOT TOO BAD FOR SOME OF 
THE IMPORTANT PREMIERSHIP MATCHES 
CONTINUING THROUGH THE COURSE OF 
TODAY MANCHESTER UNITED WILL BE 
DRY MAYBE SOME SHOWERS IN ABERDEEN 
THROUGH THE NIGHT TO NIGHT WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO SEE THE SHARP SHOWERS 
CONTINUING IN SCOTLAND AND 
THUNDERY ONES AT THAT IT WILL TURN 
MISTY AND MURKY THE FURTHER WEST 
YOU ARE BUT AGAIN IT WILL NOT BE A 
COLD NIGHT IT DOES LOOK AS THOUGH 
THE WEATHER WILL STAY WITH US 
GENERALLY SPEAKING THERE WILL BE 
SOME DECENT SPELLS OF SUNSHINE 
AROUND PERHAPS SOME CLOUD HANGING 
ON TO THE EAST COAST AND SOME 
SHOWERS WHICH WILL FADE AWAY IN 
SCOTLAND SIMILAR HIGHS EXPECTED ON 
SUNDAY SO WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
THIS WOULD BE THE HEADLINE FOR THE 
WEEKEND WARM WITH FEW SHOWERS POOL ONE OF THE U. K.'S BIGGEST 
ENERGY COMPANIES MUST GET A GRIP 
AND STAMP OUT MIS SELLING WHICH IS 
ENDEMIC AMONGST ITS SALES TEAMS 
THAT IS ACCORDING TO THE INDUSTRY 
WATCHDOG IT HAS TOLD BREAKFAST IT 
GETS SEVENTY PER CENT MORE COMPLAINTS ABOUT 
NPOWER THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY WITH 
TACTICS INCLUDING PRETENDING TO BE 
A RIVAL COMPANY OR SAY THEY NEED 
ACCESS TO READ THE METER 
NPOWER SALES AGENTS WERE 
ON THE 
STREETS THIS WEEK THEY WERE KEEN 
TO MAKE THE SALE EVEN IF IT MEANT 
GIVING THE HARD SELL NEIL SIMPSON 
IS CHAIRMAN OF THE LOCAL RESIDENTS' 
ASSOCIATION HE HAD NPOWER AGENTS 
TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH HIS DOOR 
WHILE HE GAVE THEM SHORT SHRIFT 
SEVERAL NEIGHBOURS WERE UPSET BY 
THE TACTICS 
THE MANNER THAT WAS 
BEING DESCRIBED TO ME WAS QUITE 
AGGRESSIVE IN YOUR FACE AND WOULD 
NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER OR EVEN 
FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE ADAMANTLY 
SAYING THEY WERE NOT INTERESTED 
FOUGHT IN THE DOOR SORT OF 
TECHNIQUE AND CLOSE BODY LANGUAGE 
NPOWER HAS BEEN FORCED TO ADMIT IT 
HAS GOT A PROBLEM AFTER A NEWSPAPER 
INVESTIGATION UNCOVERED MIS SELLING 
IT HAS DISMISSED A HANDFUL OF 
AGENTS IN LONDON BUT WE HAVE 
DISCOVERED IT IS FAR FROM AN 
ISOLATED INCIDENT ENERGY WATCH 
SAYS NATIONWIDE HAS HAS SEVENTY SEVENTY PER CENT 
MORE COMPLAINTS THAN ANY OTHER 
COMPANY IT SAYS THE PROBLEMS ARE 
ENDEMIC IN NPOWER SALES TEAMS THE THE FIGURES HAVE BEEN RISING STEADILY 
IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF CASES WE 
HAVE HAD AGAINST NPOWER SINCE LAST 
AUTUMN AND THE LAST MONTH WOULD BE 
THE HIGHEST THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED 
AGAINST THEM WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT 
HIS NPOWER TO STEP OUT OF DENIAL 
AND QUITE FRANKLY GET TO GRIPS WITH 
THE MIS SELLING OF THEIR AGENTS IN 
THE FIELD AND PUT A STOP TO IT 
NPOWER SALES AGENTS HAVE BEEN 
ACCUSED OF A VARIETY OF TACTICS 
WHEN SELLING DOOR TO DOOR SUCH AS 
CLAIMING THEY ARE ONLY THERE TO 
READ THE METER SAYING THEY WORK 
ARRIVAL COMPANY AND EVEN 
PRETENDING THEY REPRESENT THE 
WATCHDOG ENERGY WATCH PROBLEMS 
WITH DOORSTEP SELLING TACTICS 
EMERGED SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND A 
CODE OF CONDUCT WAS SUPPOSED TO 
IMPROVE STANDARDS BUT THE INDUSTRY 
CLAIMS THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A FEW 
ROGUE AGENTS 
YOU CAN HAVE THE MOST 
ROBUST TRAINING PROGRAMMES IN PLACE 
YOU CAN HAVE THINGS LIKE THE ENERGY 
SURE CODE WHICH THE MAJORITY OF 
ENERGY AGENTS WILL BE WORKING TO 
HAVE YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE 
INDIVIDUALS WHO DESPITE VERY 
RIGOROUS TRAINING TAKE IT UPON 
THEMSELVES TO ACT WITHOUT ETHICS 
IN STATEMENT NPOWER TOLD US THEY 
ARE CO OPERATING FULLY WITH AN 
OFGEM INVESTIGATION AND ALSO 
CARRYING OUT THEIR OWN INQUIRY 
THEY SAY PRUDENT COMPLAINTS ACCOUNT 
FOR ONLY FRACTION OF THEIR SALES 
ACTIVITIES IT COULD BE MONTHS 
BEFORE OFGEM DELIVERS ITS VERDICT 
SO IN THE MEANTIME IF THE SELLER 
COMES KNOCKING AT YOUR DOOR YOUR 
BEST MOVES MAY BE NOT TO OPEN IT 
IF YOU HAVE STORY TO TELL ABOUT 
ENERGY SALES THAN WE WOULD LIKE TO 
HEAR FROM YOU ENERGY SALESMAN

PRESTIGIOUS EVENTS ON THE AMERICAN 
TOUR 
LOOKING TO END HIS THREE YEAR WAIT

BEGAN THE SECOND ROUND WITH A TWO 
SHOT LEAD BUT IT WAS STEADY GOING 
FOR THE SPANIARD IN ROUND TWO 
AMERICANS HAVE DOMINATED THIS 
TOURNAMENT OVER THE YEARS KENNY

SERGIO GARCIA'S ROUND HER RATHER

HE AVOIDED THE WATER BUT HE HIT A 
DOUBLE BOGEY FIFTY YEAR OLD BERNHARD 
LANGER WENT ROUND IN SIXTY SEVEN TO PROVE 
THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR 
EXPERIENCE 
THE FERRARIS DOMINATED YESTERDAY'S 
PRACTICE SESSIONS FOR THE TURKISH 
GRAND PRIX HOWEVER LEWIS HAMILTON 
IS SATISFIED WITH THE TIMES HE MADE 
AROUND THE CIRCUIT AHEAD OF TODAY'S 
OFFICIAL QUALIFYING HE WAS FOURTH 
FASTEST OVER THE TWO SESSIONS BUT 
HE THINGS WITH A FEW SUBTLE CHANGES 
HE'LL BE ABLE TO COMPETE FELIPE 
MASSA IS GOING FOR A HAT TRICK OF 
WINS THE TIMES WERE A LITTLE 
SLOWER IN THE AFTERNOON 
IT'S TWO WEEKS UNTIL THE START OF 
THE FRENCH OPEN AND ROGER FEDERER 
HAS STUMBLED ON CLAY AGAIN LOSING 
IN THE QUARTER FINALS OF THE A. T. P. 
MASTERS IN ROME 
IT WAS FEDERER'S SIXTH DEFEAT OF A 
HUGELY INCONSISTENT SEASON 
ANDY RODDICK WAS MADE TO WORK HARD 
FOR HIS VICTORY OVER TOMMY ROBREDO 
IT IS A REALLY BUSY WEEKEND FOR 
MOTOR START NEXT WEEKEND 
MOTOR'S TORQUE IF YOU WANT TO SEE 
A RACING CAR SKIDDING ALONG THE TOR 
MACK YOU WOULD PROBABLY THINK IT 
IS IN TROUBLE BUT NOT SO 
ALONG THE TARMAC A BURNING DESIRE 
TO BE DIFFERENT IN ANY OTHER 
KIND OF MOTOR SPORT IF YOU SKIDDED 
YOUR CAR LIKE THAT AT ONE HUNDRED M. P. H. YOU 
WOULD HAVE MADE A MISTAKE OR 
MISJUDGED A CORNER BUT IT'S THE 
WHOLE POINT IN DRIFTING AND THAT'S 
WHY THEY GET THROUGH A SET OF TYRES 
EVERY FIVE MINUTES IT STARTED IN 
JAPAN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY AND IN THE LAST 
DECADE IT'S GONE WORLDWIDE 
I WAS GIVEN MY FIRST SPIN BY THE 
REIGNING EUROPEAN CHAMPION 
YOU ARE DRIFTING WHEN YOUR FRONT 
WHEELS ARE POINTING ONE WAY AND THE 
CAR IS TURNING THE OTHER FORGET FORGET EVERYTHING ELSE YOU'VE LEARNED WHEN 
YOU START TO DRIVE YOU THROW THE 
CAR INTO A SIDE WOODS MOTION AND 
THEN LET THE CAR SLIDE WHERE IT 
WANTS TO GO SIDE WARDS FOR 
BEGINNERS THIS IS A STRANGE 
CONCEPT TO LEARN 
REALLY GO FOR IT 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANY DAMAGE 
THE NEXT WEEK'S EUROPEAN 
CHAMPIONSHIPS NEAR EDINBURGH 
DRIVERS WILL BE ASSESSED ON THE 
ANGLE THEY TAKE SPEED AND HOW 
SPECTACULAR THEIR DRIFT LOOKS IT'S IT'S BEST DESCRIBED AS A REAL LIFE VIDEO 
GAME 
IT IS THE MOST INTENSE GAME ADRENALIN RUSH BUT HOPES OF A HIGH 
SCORE CAN SOMETIMES COME TO A 
SUDDEN END WELL DONE 
IT CAN EVEN HAPPENED TO THE 
EUROPEAN CHAMPION THERE 
JUST TELL 
ME HOW DO YOU GET THE CAR POINTING 
ONE WAY AND THE WHEELS POINTING THE 
OTHER 
IT'S A CASE OF LIFTING OFF OTHER THE CLUTCH BASICALLY AND THEY USE 
THE HANDBRAKE TO TRY TO SKID MORE 
INFORMATION ON THE B. B. C. NEWS WEBSITE 
DON'T TRY IT ON THE M. FOUR 
IT IS ILLEGAL TO SELL ALCOHOL OR 
KNIVES TO ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 
EIGHTEEN BUT WHEN THEY ARE BOUGHT ONLINE 
THERE ARE NO LAWS TO FORCE INTERNET 
RETAILERS TO CHECK THEIR CUSTOMERS 
ARE OLD ENOUGH NEXT WEEK THE 
HOUSE OF COMMONS WILL BE EXAMINING 
THE QUESTION OF CHANGING THIS BUT 
COULD IT BE MADE TO WORK ALEXANDER 
IS SIXTEEN AND HE IS AN AVID USER OF 
THE INTERNET MANY TEENAGERS USE 
THE WEB TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH 
OTHER AND TO BUY STUFF ONLINE BUT 
SOME OF IT IS ILLEGAL 
WE BUY IT 
D. V. D. S. BOOKS PEOPLE BUY ALCOHOL 
KNIVES GUNS EVEN ONE OF MY 
FRIENDS HE BOUGHT SOME ALCOHOL 
ONLINE AND IT WAS VERY EASY TO BUY 
IT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T CHECK HIS 
AGE HE JUST PUT THE DETAILS FROM 
THE CAR ONTO THE COMPUTER AND JUST 
BOUGHT IT IN SECONDS CURRENTLY CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO MANDATORY LAWS FORCING 
ONLINE RETAILERS TO VERIFY WHETHER 
SOMEONE IS OLD ENOUGH TO BE SOLD 
THINGS ONLINE BETTING FIRMS 
THOUGH ARE OBLIGED TO CHECK 
SOMEONE IS OLD ENOUGH TO GAMBLE 
ONLINE AND THEY ARE USING THE 
LATEST SOFTWARE TO VERIFY 
CUSTOMERS' AGES HOW DOES IT WORK 
IF I WANT TO REGISTER WITH A 
GAMBLING WEBSITE SUCH AS THIS ONE 
I WILL ENTER SOME PERSONAL DETAILS 
ONLINE THAT IS THEN CHECKED 
AGAINST PUBLICLY HELD DATA SUCH AS 
THE BIRTH REGISTRY THE HOME OFFICE 
OR THE LOCAL AUTHORITY WHICH 
IMMEDIATELY INDICATES WHETHER I AM 
OVER EIGHTEEN OR NOT THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS WILL BE DISCUSSING THE NEXT 
STAGE OF A PRIVATE MEMBER'S BILL 
WHICH HOPES TO FORCE COMPANIES TO 
CHECK CUSTOMERS' AGE BEFORE SELLING 
ADULT ITEMS TO THEM THAT SHOULD BE 
GOOD NEWS FOR COMPANIES LIKE THIS 
ONE WHICH SELLS AGE VERY OCCASION 
SOFTWARE TO GAMBLING WEBSITE AGE 
VERIFICATION 
THE FIRST RETAILERS VERIFICATION TO EMBRACE THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL 
SEE A SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE TIME 
IT TAKES TO PERFORM A TRANSACTION 
AND THEREFORE POTENTIALLY A LOSS OF 
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE SO UNLESS 
THE CHECKS ARE MADE OBLIGATORY I 
THINK PARENTS WILL CONTINUE TO 
WORRY ABOUT WHAT THEIR KIDS CAN GET 
ONLINE 
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE ABOUT ONLINE WHETHER THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT 
NUMBER OF INSTANCES ABOUT 
YOUNGSTERS BUYING AGE RESTRICTED 
PRODUCTS ONLINE NO RESPONSIBLE 
RETAILER WOULD HAVE ANY INTEREST IN 
SELLING THOSE SORTS OF THINGS TO 
YOUNGSTERS THERE ARE AL NUMBER OF 
DIFFERENT PROTECTIONS IN PLACE 
MANY WEBSITES REQUIRE YOU TO 
REGISTER IF YOU BUY SOMETHING LIKE 
ALCOHOL THE RETAILER WILL ONLY 
DELIVER THAT TO YOU FACE TO FACE 
AND THERE IS THE ISSUE OF DATA 
PROTECTION SHARING EVEN MORE 
SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION 
ONLINE COULD MAKE THE PROBLEM OF 
IDENTITY THEFT EVEN WORSE 
THE HEADLINES THERE ARE WARNINGS 
THAT MORE PEOPLE COULD DIE IN BURMA 
IN THE WAKE OF THE CYCLONE UNLESS 
INCREASED AID SUPPLIES ARE 
DELIVERED SOON HEAD TEACHERS SAY 
THEY ARE CONCERNED THAT STUDENTS 
ARE BEING PUT UNDER PRESSURE 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TOO MANY EXAMS IN 
A SINGLE DAY THEY SAY SOME PEOPLE 
PUPILS ARE SPENDING SEVEN HOURS

HANDSET HOARDER DAN SIMMONS TAKES A 
LOOK AT WHAT COMES NEXT SINCE THE 
MARRIAGE OF WEB CAMS AND BROADBAND 
THE VIDEO BLOG HAS BECOME A 
FAMILIAR SIGHT EVEN MAINSTREAM POP 
VIDEOS ARE BORROWING FROM THE GENRE 
IT HAS ALSO HELPED CREATE THE FIRST 
INTERNET CELEBRITIES ALTHOUGH THIS 
GIRL HAD A FEW MORE FRIENDS THAN 
SHE LET ON BUT NOW VIDEO BLOGGING 
HAS MOVED OFF THE WEB CAM AND ON TO 
THE MOBILE PHONE FASTER 
CONNECTIONS AND ALL INCLUSIVE DATA 
PACKAGES MEAN I DON'T NEED A LOT OF 
CASH TO UPLOAD WHAT I HAVE CREATED 
TO THE WEB THERE IS A VIDEO 
EDITING ON MANY PHONES ON BOARD AS 
WELL 
BEHIND ME IS THE HOTEL WELL THIS WAS SHOT AND EDITED ON THE 
BEAUTY PHONE EACH SHOP WAS ADDED 
ONE AT TIME IT IS POSSIBLE TO 
DROP IN PHOTOS AND EVEN SPEED 
THINGS UP BIT THEN SEND THE 
MASTERPIECE DIRECTLY TO YOUTUBE A A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO PEOPLE WERE 
HAPPY TO RECORD WHAT THEY WANTED 
AND IT WAS A NEW THING NOW IT IS 
GETTING MORE SOPHISTICATED PEOPLE 
WANT TO BE ABLE TO PERSONALISE IT 
IF YOU WANT TO PUT SOME MUSIC TO IT 
BRING OUT THE FUNNY PART YOU CAN

MAKES THE AUDIO SO YOU DON'T LOSE 
BACKGROUND SOUNDS WHEN YOU ADD 
MUSIC THE MOTOROLA Z. TEN ADS SLOW 
MOTION EFFECTS ALL FROM THE HANDSET 
EDITING ON A MOBILE PHONE CAN BE A 
LITTLE BIT FIDDLY BUT IT MEANS I 
DON'T HAVE TO TRANSFER MY VIDEO TO 
A P. C. I CAN JUST SEND IT BUT SOME 
MOBILE OPERATORS ARE TOO BUSY 
TRYING TO TIE US INTO THE WEBSITE 
THAT THEY HAVE SIGNED EXCLUSIVE 
DEALS WORTH 
HAVING THESE SYSTEMS 
OR CONTAINERS WERE YOU'RE CONTENT 
ONLY GOES TO ONE SIDE IS NOT 
NATURAL TO THE WAY THE INTERNET 
WORKS WE WANT OUR CONTENT TO BE

BIG FLOOD STORY IN A WEEK WE GOT 
OVER TWO HUNDRED FORTY VIDEO CLIPS OF MOBILE 
FOOTAGE 
THERE ARE SOME LIMITATIONS FOOTAGE THE EASIEST WAY TO UPLOAD IT IS 
THROUGH M. M. S. IT IS THE SAME AS 
SENDING A TEXT BUT FOR VIDEO M. M. S. 
CAN ONLY DELIVER SHORTER VIDEOS 
TYPICALLY LESS THAN THIRTY SECONDS ONE 
ALTERNATIVE IS TO ATTACH IT TO AN 
E. MAIL TO SPEED THINGS UP WHY NOT 
SEND YOUR VIDEOS AS YOU RECORD THEM 
IT IS THE LATEST FAD IN THE U. S. 
THIS IS ONE WEBSITE THE SUPPORT 
LIVE STREAMING BUT AT THE MOMENT 
IT IS COMPATIBLE WITH JUST A 
HANDFUL OF MODELS ONCE THE

PRETTY EASY TO GO LIVE THE NUMBERS 
AND THE TOP RIGHT HAND CORNER OF 
THE SCREEN SHOWED THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN CAPTURE AND STREAMING TO 
THE WEB AND THAT DEPENDS ON YOUR 
DATA CONNECTION IT CAN BE A LITTLE 
BIT JILTED BUT YOU ARE ALMOST LIVE 
HOW THIS COULD BE MODERATED HIS NOT 
YET CLEAR THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN

THAT IS ENOUGH TO OFFER OTHER 
SERVICES LIKE EDUCATION AND HEALTH 
WHERE HEALTH CARE 
YOU KNOW THE BEST THING ABOUT 
BLUETOOTH IT IS HOW GREAT IT MAKES 
YOU LOOK WHEN YOU WERE ONE OF THESE 
BLUETOOTH HEADSETS SO THEY ARE O. K. 
FOR MAKING TELEPHONE CALLS THE 
QUALITY IS NOT GREAT BUT YOU CAN 
TELL WHAT THE OTHER PERSON IS 
SAYING IF YOU HAVE EVER TRIED TO

THE HEAD PHONE PORT OF YOUR PLAYER 
SO THERE IS NO COMPLICATED 
CONNECTOR THAT IS NOT COMPATIBLE 
WITH ALL DEVICES YOU PLUG THAT IN 
THEN THERE IS AN ELASTIC BAND THE 
RANGE OF THE DEVICE IS ABOUT TEN 
METRES SO YOU CANNOT LEAVE YOUR 
PLAYERS AND GO WANDERING AROUND THE 
HOUSE IN PRACTICE IT WILL PROBABLY 
BE LESS THAN TEN METRES AND THE 
PRICE IS THREE HUNDRED THE OTHER PROBLEM 
WITH WIRELESS ANYTHING IS THAT 
GENERALLY IT DOES NOT COME WITH ITS 
OWN POWER SUPPLY SO YOU NEED TO 
CHARGE THEM UP THE CARRY CASE 
DOUBLES AS THE CHARGES ARE YOU 
CLICK THEM INTO PLACE PLUG THAT IN 
AND CHARGE THEM IF YOU DON'T WANT 
TO SPEND THAT KIND OF MONEY OR YOU

NINE A GROWING CRISIS IN BURMA 
STILL NO VISAS FOR AID WORKERS A 
GROWING CRISIS 
GOOD MORNING ALSO COMING UP THE 
BIG EXAM CROWN HEAD TEACHERS SAY 
PUPILS ARE BEING ASKED TO SIT TOO 
MANY TESTS IN A SINGLE DAY CROWN 
CONNING ON THE DOORSTEP 
NPOWER IS TOLD TO CRACK DOWN ON 
DODGY SALESMEN ON THE SKIDS MIKE 
BUSHELL DRIFTS HIS WAY INTO THE 
LATEST MOTOR RACING KRAYS OUR MAIN 
STORY THERE ARE WARNINGS THAT 
MORE PEOPLE COULD DIE IN BURMA IN 
THE WAKE OF THE CYCLONE AND LESS 
INCREASED AID IS DELIVERED SOON 
THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES APPEAR TO 
BE HONOURING A PLEDGE TO ACCEPT AID 
SUPPLIES BUT THE STAFF WHO WERE 
SUPPOSED TO ACCOMPANY THE CARGOES 
ARE STILL WAITING FOR VISAS WITH 
THREE MORE AID FLIGHTS DUE TO 
ARRIVE TODAY THERE ARE SIGNS AT 
LAST THAT THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT IS 
RESPONDING TO THE PRESSURE TO ALLOW 
MORE SUPPLIES INTO THE COUNTRY BUT 
THERE IS NO SIGN OF ANY 
BREAKTHROUGH OVER FOREIGN AID 
WORKERS 
WE APPLIED FOR SIXTEEN VISAS SO WORKERS FAR IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF 
THE CYCLONE AND SO FAR ONLY ONE 
HAS BEEN GRANTED IT IS IMMENSELY 
FRUSTRATING WORKING BY REMOTE 
CONTROL FROM THE COUNTRY NEXT DOOR 
ULTIMATELY IT'S UNSUSTAINABLE IN IN THE MEANTIME THE PEOPLE OF BOGALAY 
IN THE IRRAWADDY DELTA DO WHATEVER 
THEY CAN TO SURVIVE THIS LOW LYING 
REGION BORE THE BRUNT OF THE STORM 
IT SHOULD BE THE FOCUS OF A HUGE 
AID OPERATION BUT WHAT IS COMING 
IN IS JUST A DROP IN THE OCEAN OF 
WHAT IS NEEDED BURMA APPEARS TO 
REMAIN INSISTENT THAT IT WILL 
DISTRIBUTE SUPPLIES ITSELF STAGE 
MANAGED PHOTO CALLS ON STATE RUN 
TELEVISION SHOW A GOVERNMENT IN 
CONTROL BUT EXPERTS SAY THE SCALE 
OF THE DISASTER IS TOO VAST TO BE 
HANDLED ALONE IN FACT THE MINDS 
OF THE MILITARY LEADERS WILL BE 
DISTRACTED THIS WEEKEND BY A 
REFERENDUM ON THE COUNTRY'S 
CONSTITUTION DESPITE WORLDWIDE 
CALLS TO POSTPONE THE VOTE THE 
GOVERNMENT IS CONTINUING WITH PLANS 
FOR CHANGES THAT WOULD FURTHER 
STRENGTHEN THE JUNTA'S GRIP ON 
POWER PUSHING THE REST OF THE 
WORLD EVEN FURTHER AWAY 
LET'S TALK NOW TO OUR ASIA 
CORRESPONDENT WHO IS AT AN AIRBASE 
NEAR THE THAI CAPITAL BANGKOK 
FROM WHERE AND AID PLANE IS DUE TO 
LEAVE FOR BURMA GOOD MORNING AN 
AID PLANE HOW MANY FLIGHTS WOULD 
BE THE AGENCY'S BE HOPING TO GET 
INTO BURMA AT THIS STAGE 
RIGHT NOW AT THE BANGKOK AIR FORCE 
BASE THERE ARE TWO FLIGHTS 
PREPARING TO LEAVE THESE ARE THAI 
GOVERNMENT FLIGHTS IT IS GOVERNMENT THAT BURMA IS 
COMFORTABLE WITH THEY APPEAR TO BE 
READY TO LEAVE WITHIN THE NEXT HALF 
AN HOUR THESE ARE ONLY THE FOURTH 
AND FIFTH FLIGHTS THAILAND HAS 
MANAGED TO GET IN THE UNITED 
NATIONS IS DOING EVEN WORSE THE 
WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME HAS ONLY GOT 
THREE FLIGHTS IN SO FAR THEY ARE 
HOPING TO GET ANOTHER TWO EVEN 
THREE IN TODAY BUT THEY SAY IT IS 
COMPLETELY UNCERTAIN WHETHER THEY 
WILL GET THE FLIGHT PERMITS THIS 
AIR BASE IS VERY BIG IT'S ONLY AN 
HOUR'S FLIGHT FROM RANGOON IF THIS 
DISASTER HAVE HAPPENED IN ANY OTHER 
COUNTRY AND AIR FORCE BASED THIS 
CLOSE WOULD HAVE BEEN TEEMING WITH 
INTERNATIONAL AID WORKERS AND WITH 
RELIEF SUPPLIES BUT IT'S ALMOST 
EMPTY GIVING YOU AN IDEA OF HOW 
LIMITED IS RELIEF EFFORT IS 
REMEMBER IT DOES MAKE BIG 
DIFFERENCE THAT THE AID PERSONNEL 
ARE NOT BEING ALLOWED IN L. WAS 
TALKING TO THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME 
EARLIER AND THEY SAID THEY HAD 
LEFT SIX PORTABLE WHERE HOUSES 
WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY VITAL IN 
RANGOON BUT THEY SAY ONLY THEIR 
STAFF HAVE THE TECHNICAL ABILITY TO 
PUT THEM TOGETHER BUT THE BURMESE 
WILL NOT ALLOW THEM IN THERE IS NO 
WAY THE BURMESE ARMY WILL BE ABLE 
TO DO IT THEY SAY IS IT CLEAR WHY 
THE BURMESE JUNTA ARE BEING SO 
RESTRICTIVE I'M AFRAID NOTHING IS 
EVER CLEAR WHEN IT COMES TO TRYING 
TO WORK OUT THE DECISION MAKING OF 
THE GENERALS WHO RUN BURMA THE TOP 
GENERAL HE IS OLD AND ISOLATED HE 
MAY NOT EVEN HAVE A FULL GRASP OF 
HOW BAD THINGS ARE IN THE DELTA 
UNDERSTAND FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
BEEN TALKING TO THE BURMESE 
MILITARY THAT THE TOP GENERALS 
THINK WITH A BIGGER ARMY THEY CAN 
COPE ON THEIR OWN THAT ALL THEY 
NEED IS WHAT THE AID AGENCIES CALL 
DUMP AND RUN WHERE THEY JUST LEAVE 
THE AID AT RANGOON AIRPORT BUT 
THERE BY DISASTERS WILL TELL YOU 
THAT THIS WILL NOT WORK YOU NEED 
HUGE AMOUNTS OF EXPERTISE AND 
LOGISTICAL ORGANISATION TO GET AID 
EVEN ONCE IT HAS GOT INTO THE 
COUNTRY OUT TO THE VERY REMOTE 
AREAS THERE IS NO WAY THE BURMESE 
ARMY WILL COPE BUT IT IS POSSIBLE 
THE TOP LEADERSHIP SIMPLY DO NOT 
REALISE THAT 
THE PRESSURE IS ON FOUR THOUSAND 
SCHOOLCHILDREN AS THE EXAM SEASON 
IS UPON US 
TEACHING UNIONS SAY THE 
PROBLEM HAS BEEN MADE WORSE BY WHAT 
THEY CALL EXAM CONGESTION SOME 
PUPILS WILL HAVE TO SPEND UP TO 
SEVEN HOURS SITTING THREE OR FOUR 
EXAMS IN A SINGLE DAY THE NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION OF HEAD TEACHERS HAS 
SAID THE PILE UP COULD AFFECT 
PUPILS' RESULTS STRESS LEVELS IN 
SCHOOLS ARE RATCHETING UP BUT THIS 
YEAR IT'S BEEN MADE WORSE 
ACCORDING TO TEACHING UNIONS BY 
EXAM CONGESTION WITH PUPILS HAVING 
EXAMS CRAMMED TOGETHER EVEN 
CLASHING STUDENTS ARE NOW STUDYING 
MORE SUBJECTS AT THE HEIGHT OF THE 
EXAM SEASON THEY CAN BE SITTING 
EXAMINATIONS FOR AS MUCH AS SEVEN 
HOURS A DAY THESE A LEVEL STUDENTS 
HAVE A EXAMS SO TIGHTLY PACKED 
THEY BELIEVE RESULTS WILL BE 
AFFECTED HAVE THEIR EXAMS SO 
TIGHTLY PACKED L. HAVE GOT NINE 
EXAMS WITHIN THREE DAYS 
YOU FEEL 
BY THE TIME YOU HAVE GOT TO YOUR 
LAST SUBJECT YOU'RE PUTTING IN 
LESS EFFORT THAN YOU WERE AT A 
BEGINNING BECAUSE IT IS THREE O'CLOCK 
IN THE AFTERNOON AND YOU ARE STILL 
SITTING IN EXAM CONDITIONS 
SO IT 
DEFINITELY DOES AFFECT THE FINAL 
GRADE YOU WILL GET PUPILS THAT 
HAVE GOT THEIR TIMETABLE MORE 
SPREAD OUT WILL HAVE AN ADVANTAGE 
THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'LL FIND IN IS 
THAT WE'RE GETTING A REAL BUNCHING 
OF EXAMS IN ONE DAY 
STUDENTS CAN 
BE SITTING THREE EXAMS IN A DAY 
THEY ARE MENTALLY EXHAUSTED BY THE 
LAST EXAM WHICH MAY WELL HAVE AN 
EFFECT ON THEIR FINAL GRADE 
TEACHING UNIONS SAY THE LARGER 
NUMBER OF EXAMS IS GETTING WORSE 
WHICH IS CAUSING UNACCEPTABLE 
STRESS LEVELS IN PUPILS 
THE EXAM 
BOARDS NEED TO DO EVEN MORE TO CO 
ORDINATE THEIR EFFORTS SO THAT 
YOUNGSTERS DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM 
OF THREE AND FOUR EXAMINATIONS ON 
ONE DAY WHICH IS CLEARLY ASKING 
TOO MUCH OF ANYBODY 
IT CAN'T 
ENCOURAGE BEST PERFORMANCE BY THEM 
THE JOINT COUNCIL FOR 
QUALIFICATIONS REPRESENTS THE EXAM 
BODIES IT SAYS IT HAS A DIFFICULT 
JOB TRYING TO CRAM AROUND THREE THOUSAND EXAM 
PAPERS INTO THIRTY DAYS OF EXAMINATIONS 
BUT THEY SAY 
THE EXAM LOG JAM IS LIKELY TO GET 
EVEN WORSE NEXT YEAR AS NEW AND 
OLD A LEVEL SYSTEMS OVERLAP 
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW WE'LL BE 
TALKING TO THE NATIONAL UNION OF 
TEACHERS ABOUT EXAM CONGESTION IN A 
FEW MINUTES' TIME THE SELLING 
TACTICS OF ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST 
ENERGY COMPANIES HAVE BEEN STRONGLY 
CRITICISED BY THE INDUSTRY WATCHDOG 
ENERGYWATCH SAYS NPOWER MUST STAMP 
OUT WIDESPREAD MIS SELLING BY ITS 
DOOR TO DOOR SALES TEAM THE 
COMPANY HAS DISMISSED A HANDFUL OF 
AGENTS AFTER A NEWSPAPER 
INVESTIGATION BUT BREAKFAST HAS 
DISCOVERED THAT THOSE WERE NOT 
ISOLATED INCIDENTS MORE ON THAT 
STORY IN TEN MINUTES TONY BLAIR IS 
ADVISING GORDON BROWN HAD TO WIN 
THE NEXT ELECTION ACCORDING TO 
CHERIE BLAIR HER AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS 
BEING SERIALISED IN THE TIMES 
NEWSPAPER TODAY SHE SUGGESTS MR. 
BROWN WAS RATTLING THE KEYS OF 
DOWNING STREET OVER THE FORMER P. M.'S 
HEAD TRYING TO GET HIM OUT OF 
OFFICE BEFORE THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE LECTION 
SHE HAS NEVER BEEN AFRAID TO SPEAK 
HER MIND 
AND NOW CHERIE BLAIR HAS REVEALED 
THE LOVE HATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 
HER HUSBAND AND THE MAN WHO USED TO 
LIVE NEXT DOOR GORDON BROWN IN AN 
INTERVIEW IN TODAY'S TIMES MRS. 
BLAIR DISCLOSES THAT TONY BLAIR IS 
IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH THE PRIME 
MINISTER AND IS GIVING HIM ADVICE 
ON HOW TO WIN THE NEXT ECTION SHE SAYS 
HOWEVER SHE ALSO CLAIMS THAT HER 
HUSBAND MIGHT HAVE STOOD DOWN IN 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE BUT FOR THE FACT THAT HE FELT 
GORDON BROWN WAS TRYING TO PUSH HIM 
OUT OF OFFICE MRS. BLAIR HAS CHOSEN 
TO GIVE HER ACCOUNT OF THE BLAIR 
BROWN YEARS NOW BECAUSE HER 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS BEING PUBLISHED 
NEXT WEEK HER ANTIPATHY TOWARDS 
GORDON BROWN HAS BEEN ONE OF 
WESTMINSTER'S WORST KEPT SECRETS 
AND SOMETHING OF STANDING JOKE 
AT LEAST THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY 
OF OUT HER RUNNING OFF WITH THE 
BLOKE NEXT DOOR 
I DON'T BUT LAST NIGHT CHERIE 
BLAIR'S PUBLISHERS INSISTED THE 
DECISION TO BRING THE PUBLICATION 
FORWARD WAS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO ADD 
TO GORDON BROWN'S WOES THEY SAID 
IT HAPPENED BECAUSE THE BOOK WAS 
FINISHED EARLY LAST NIGHT DOWNING 
STREET SAID IT WOULD NOT BE 
COMMENTING BUT CONFIRMED THAT THE 
TWO MEN TO TALK REGULARLY 
MY DO 
DO TALK REGULARLY HUNDREDS OF 
PASSENGERS WERE FORCED TO STAY IN A 
TRAIN STATION IN ONTARIO AFTER 
PEOPLE FELL ILL WITH FLU LIKE 
SYMPTOMS THE TRAIN WAS QUARANTINED 
WHILE AUTHORITIES INVESTIGATED THE 
INCIDENT SEVEN HUNDRED COUPLES WITH A 
COMBINED TOTAL OF MORE THAN FORTY THREE THOUSAND 
YEARS OF MARRIAGE WILL BE 
CELEBRATING THEIR WEDDING 
ANNIVERSARIES AT A SPECIAL MASS IN 
WESTMINSTER CATHEDRAL LATER TODAY 
THE ARCHBISHOP OF THE DIOCESE 
CARDINAL CORMAC MURPHY O'CONNOR 
INVITED HUSBANDS AND WIVES MARKING 
SPECIAL WEDDING ANNIVERSARIES TO 
ATTEND TWENTY NINE OF THEM HAVE BEEN 
MARRIED FOR MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS A 
LITTLE LATER IN THE PROGRAMME WILL 
BE SPEAKING TO ONE OF THE COUPLES 
ATTENDING THAT CEREMONY 
OUR TOP STORY THIS TIME OF YEAR 
HAS ALWAYS BEEN HARD FOR STUDENTS 
BUT THEY ARE HAVING TO WORK HARDER 
BUTTHEYAREHAVINGTOWORK I RD R. THAN EVER WITH SOME PUPILS SITTING 
UP TO FOUR EXAMS A TOTAL OF SEVEN 
HOURS IN ONE DAY LET'S SPEAK NOW 
TO THE HEAD OF EDUCATION AT THE 
NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS THIS 
MUST BE CAUSING TEACHERS CONCERNED 
YES IT'S CAUSING TEACHER IS 
CONCERNED BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY 
HIGH STAKES EXAMS AND THE RESULTS 
ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOUNGSTERS 
AND FOR THE SCHOOLS 
I THINK WHAT 
WE HAVE IS OVER THE LAST SEVEN TO A 
YEARS WE HAVE HAD A LOT MORE EXAMS 
BOTH PRE SIXTEEN AND POST SIXTEEN OVER THE 
LAST SEVEN MACRO TO EIGHT YEARS 
OVER THE LAST SEVEN TO EIGHT YEARS 
WE HAVE HAD A LOT MORE EXAMS SO 
IT IS SIMPLY THAT THERE ARE JUST A 
MORE PAPERS MORE EXAMS AND 
THEREFORE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF 
EXAMS THAT NEED TO BE SCHEDULED 
WHY NOT EXTEND THE EXAM PERIOD SO 
THAT THERE CAN BE FEWER EXAMS OVER 
MORE DAYS WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
IS FOR YOU WERE TERMINAL EXAMS AT 
THE END OF THE COURSE 
IN FACT 
THERE ARE ONE OR TWO RAYS OF HOPE 
ON THE HORIZON THERE IS A NEW 
PROCESS CALLED CONTROLLED 
ASSESSMENT WHICH I THINK IS VERY 
PRODUCTIVE AND WITH THE 
INTRODUCTION OF NEW INFORMATION 
TECHNOLOGY TEACHERS ARE ABLE TO 
RECORD YOUNGSTERS' PROGRESS AS THEY 
GO THROUGH THE COURSE AND BUILD UP 
AN ELECTRONIC PORTFOLIO PERHAPS 
THAT IS THE WAY TO REDUCE THE 
AMOUNT OF EXAMS AT THE END OF A 
COURSE WILL THAT BE SOMETHING THAT 
WILL BE ACCEPTED BY EXAM BOARDS 
YES I THINK THE EXAMPLE WARDS 
EVERY YEAR REALLY STRIVE TO CO 
ORDINATE THE EXAMS AND TO CUT THEM 
DOWN 
THERE IS ANOTHER FACTOR AND DOWN THAT IS THAT THERE ARE NEW EXAMS ON 
THE BLOCK YOUNGSTERS WANT TO TAKE 
THESE NEW EXAMS PARTICULARLY IN 
AREAS LIKE MEDIA STUDIES AND 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SO IT'S A 
QUESTION OF GETTING THE BALANCE 
BETWEEN LOOKING AT THE PROGRESS 
THROUGHOUT THE COURSE AND THEN 
HAVING THOSE CHECKS AT THE END OF 
THE COURSE WE HAVEN'T GOT THAT 
BALANCE YET THE JOINT COUNCIL FOR 
QUALIFICATIONS SAYS THAT WHEN IT 
PUBLISHES ITS DRAFT TIMETABLES IT 
GETS FEEDBACK FROM SCHOOLS AND 
COLLEGES AND PRESUMABLY THERE ARE 
TEACHERS FLAGGING THESE PROBLEMS 
UP 
THAT'S AN INTERESTING POINT UP A IN FACT IT IS LITTLE KNOWN BUT 
TEACHERS ARE INVITED TO COMMENT ON 
THE EXAM PAPERS AND THE TIMING I I WOULD LIKE TO SEE TEACHERS MUCH 
MORE IN THE DRIVING SEAT WHEN IT 
COMES TO COMMENTING AND THEY ARE AT 
THE MOMENT THERE ARE SOME EXAM 
BOARDS THAT FIND HIM A PAIN AND DO 
NOT WANT TEACHERS THERE OTHERS 
DON'T BUT I THINK TEACHERS' VIEWS 
ON HOW THEY ARE THE EXAM PROCESS 
RUNS COULD HELP CHILDREN ON HOW 
THE EXAM PROCESS RUNS MEANWHILE 
WHAT EFFECT DOES IT HAVE ON A 
STUDENT WHO IS FACING FOR EXAMS 
AND SEVEN HOURS IN ONE DAY 
FOUR 
EXAMS AND AS YOU SAY SOMEWHAT THE 
BEST WEATHER OF THE YEAR AS WELL I I THINK MOST YOUNGSTERS CAN COPE WITH 
THAT I THINK THE ISSUE IS HOW 
MUCH LEARNING IS EMBEDDED HOW MUCH 
DO YOU REMEMBER THERE ARE 
OBVIOUSLY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE 
ENORMOUSLY NERVOUS AND THEY ARE 
THE ONES WHO SUFFER FUNNILY ENOUGH 
GIRLS FOR EXAMPLE SOME GIRLS FIND 
IT QUITE DIFFICULT AND IT HAS BEEN 
SHOWN THAT A COURSE WIDER 
ASSESSMENT BENEFITS GIRLS 
TO SUMMARISE YOU WON THE EXAM 
BOARDS TO TAKE MORE NOTICE OF 
TEACHERS 
THAT IS RIGHT YES DO TEACHERS DO GET IN TOUCH WITH US WITH YOUR 
VIEWS VIEWS THIS IS BREAKFAST THERE ARE 
WARNINGS THAT MORE PEOPLE COULD DIE 
IN BURMA IN THE WAKE OF THE CYCLONE 
UNLESS INCREASED AID SUPPLIES ARE 
DELIVERED SOON 
AS WE HAVE BEEN 
HEARING TEACHERS ARE SAYING THEY 
ARE CONCERNED STUDENTS ARE BEING 
PUT UNDER PRESSURE BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE TOO MANY EXAMS IN A SINGLE DAY 
AND THIS HALF HOUR WITHEY ENERGY 
WATCHDOG IS GETTING TOUGH WITH ONE 
COMPANY'S SALES TEAMS WHY THE 
ENERGY WATCHDOG 
IT IS LOVELY WEATHER 
THE SAVING GRACE IS THAT AT LEAST 
YOU CAN SIT IN THE GARDEN AND DO 
SOME REVISION BECAUSE THE WEATHER 
IS BEHAVING ITSELF THIS WEEKEND 
THERE WILL GENERALLY BE A WARM FEEL 
TO THE DAY BUT THERE ARE SOME 
THUNDERSTORMS AROUND AT THE 
AND THEY ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE 
SOME CLOUD FEEDING IN FROM THE 
ATLANTIC SO MAYBE A CLOUDIER START 
THE NEW HAVE BEEN USED TO THE 
SHOWERS ARE MOVING INTO NORTHERN 
IRELAND AT THE MOMENT SO YOU COULD 
HAVE SOME SHARP SHOWERS TO 
ENCOUNTER OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS 
THESE SHOWERS MAY WELL MIGRATE 
FURTHER NORTH AGAIN TOWARDS 
SCOTLAND DURING THE AFTERNOON 
DESPITE A DRY AND OVERCAST START 
THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE SOME SHOWERS 
CROPPING UP BRIGHTER SKIES TO THE 
EAST OF THE PENNINES BUT ANY 
MISTINESS WELL CLEAR VERY RAPIDLY 
INDEED MORE IN THE WAY OF SUNSHINE 
PERHAPS TO THE SOUTH WEST AND A 
WARMER FEEL IN COMPARISON TO 
YESTERDAY AS THE DAY CONTINUES WE 
WON'T SEE TOO MANY PROBLEMS FOR 
ENGLAND AND WALES A ROGUE SHOWER 
POPPING UP IN THE NORTH WEST 
NOTHING TOO SIGNIFICANT SHOWERS IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND AND SCOTLAND HERE

REPEAT CONDITIONS TOMORROW IN TERMS

WEEKEND FOR THE MANCHESTER UNITED 
AND CHELSEA MATCHES TAKING PLACE ON 
SUNDAY A WARM WEEKEND AHEAD WITH 
JUST FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS AROUND ENJOY ENJOY IT IS LOVELY ISN'T IT IF YOU LIKE 
THE HEAT THAT IS NPOWER ONE OF THE U. K.'S BIGGEST ENERGY COMPANIES 
MUST GET A GRIP AND STAMP OUT MIS 
SELLING WHICH IS ENDEMIC AMONGST 
ITS SALES TEAMS THAT IS ACCORDING 
TO ENERGYWATCH WHICH HAS TOLD 
BREAKFAST IT GETS SEVENTY PER CENT MORE 
COMPLAINTS ABOUT THEM THAN ANY 
OTHER COMPANY WITH TACTICS SUCH AS 
PRETENDING TO BE RIVAL COMPANY 
PAUL MACRO SALES AGENTS WERE OUT ON 
THE STREET THIS WEEK PROMISING 
CHEAPER ENERGY BILLS THEY WERE KEEN TO MAKE SALE 
EVEN IF 
IT 
MEANT GIVING CUSTOMERS HARD SELL 
NEIL SIMPSON IS CHAIRMAN OF THE 
LOCAL RESIDENTS' ASSOCIATION HE 
HAD NPOWER AGENTS TRYING TO PUSH 
THROUGH HIS DOOR SEVERAL OF HIS 
NEIGHBOURS WERE ALSO UPSET BY THEIR 
TACTICS 
THE MANNER OF THE IS BEING TACTICS DESCRIBED HIS THEY WERE QUITE 
AGGRESSIVE IN YOUR FACE AND THEY 
WOULD NOT TAKE NO FROM AN ANSWER 
NO FOR AN ANSWER EVEN FROM PEOPLE 
WHO WERE 
QUITE ADAMANT 
FOUGHT IN 
THE 
DOOR KIND 
OF TECHNIQUE AND 
CLOSE BODY LANGUAGE 
NPOWER HAS 
BEEN FORCED TO ADMIT 
IT HAS 
GOT A 
BEEN FORCED TO ADMIT IT HAS GOT A PROBLEM AFTER A NEWSPAPER 
INVESTIGATION UNCOVERED BY ONE 
OF ITS 
TEAMS IT HAS 
DISMISSED SOME 
AGENTS IN 
LONDON BUT 
WE HAVE DISCOVERED IT IS FAR FROM 
ISOLATED INCIDENT ENERGYWATCH SAYS 
IT HAS HAD SEVENTY PER CENT MORE COMPLAINTS 
ABOUT NPOWER THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY 
IT SAYS THE PROBLEMS ARE ENDEMIC IN 
THE SALES TEAMS 
THE FIGURES HAVE 
BEEN RISING STEADILY IN TERMS OF 
THE NUMBER OF CASES WE HAVE HAD 
AGAINST NPOWER SINCE LAST AUTUMN 
THE LAST MONTH WOULD BE 
THE HIGHEST 
WE HAVE RECEIVED AGAINST THEM WHAT 
WE WOULD EXPECT HIS NPOWER TO STEP 
OUT OF 
DENIAL AND QUITE FRANKLY GET 
TO GRIPS 
WITH THE 
MIS SELLING OF 
THEIR AGENTS 
IN THE 
FIELD AND 
PUT A 
STOP TO IT 
NPOWER SALES AGENTS 
HAVE BEEN ACCUSED 
OF A 
VARIETY OF 
TACTICS WHEN SELLING DOOR TO DOOR 
SUCH AS CLAIMING THEY ARE ONLY 
THERE TO 
READ THE 
METER SAYING 
THEY WORK 
FOR A 
RIVAL COMPANY 
EVEN PRETENDING TO BE ENERGYWATCH 
PROBLEMS WITH DOORSTEP SELLING 
TACTICS EMERGED SEVERAL YEARS AGO 
AND A CODE OF CONDUCT WAS SUPPOSED 
TO IMPROVE STANDARDS BUT THE 
INDUSTRY CLAIMS THERE WILL ALWAYS 
BE A FEW ROGUE AGENT 
YOU CAN HAVE 
THE MOST ROBUST TRAINING PROGRAMMES 
IN PLACE 
YOU CAN HAVE THINGS 
THE ENERGY SURE CODE WHICH THE 
MAJORITY OF ENERGY AGENT WILL BE 
WORKING TO YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE 
INDIVIDUALS WHO DESPITE VERY 
RIGOROUS TRAINING TAKE IT UPON 
THEMSELVES TO ACT WITHOUT ETHICS 
IN STATEMENT NPOWER TOLD US THEY 
ARE CO OPERATING FULLY WITH AN 
OFGEM INVESTIGATION AND ALSO 
CARRYING OUT THEIR OWN INQUIRY 
THEY SAY COMPLAINTS ACCOUNT FOR 
ONLY SMALL FRACTION OF THEIR 
SALES ACTIVITIES IT COULD BE 
MONTHS BEFORE OFGEM DELIVERS ITS 
VERDICT SO IN THE MEANTIME IF THE 
SELLER COMES KNOCKING AT YOUR DOOR 
YOUR BEST MOVE MAY BE NOT TO OPEN 
IT IT IN A MOMENT PETER BRADSHAW OF THE 
GUARDIAN WILL TALK US THROUGH WHAT 
HAS CAUGHT HIS EYE IN THE PAPER 
GOOD MORNING 
FIRST 
GOOD MORNING FIRST THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING 
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH HAS A BIG 
PICTURE OF CHERIE BLAIR WE KNOW 
MORE 
ABOUT WHAT 
WAS GOING 
ON 
THE SCENES AS 
HER AUTOBIOGRAPHY 
HAS 
BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD A LOT OF 
STUFF ABOUT THE GORDON BROWN TONY 
BLAIR RELATIONSHIP 
THAT IS IN NO TIME DOES WELL THE 
TIMES IS SERIALISING HER STORY THE 
MAIN LINE IS THAT TONY BLAIR IS 
ADVISING GORDON BROWN ON WHAT 
TO DO 
IN THE 
CURRENT TURMOIL 
AND HOW TO 
WIN THE NEXT ECTION 
THE DAILY EXPRESS HAS A STORY ABOUT 
A MAN WHO SPENT 
EIGHTEEN HOURS 
IN 
PRISON CELL 
BECAUSE HE DROPPED AN 
APPLE CORE HE WAS LOCKED UP AFTER 
HE REFUSED TO ACCEPT AN ON THE SPOT 
FINE FINE THE DAILY MIRROR THIS MORNING HAS A 
STORY FROM AUSTRIA AND THAT CASE 
ABOUT THE CHILDREN HELD IN THE 
CELLAR CELLAR THE FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY MAIL 
HAS A STORY ABOUT B. B. C. CHILDREN IN 
NEED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND WAS KEPT BACK DURING 
THE MAKING OF THE PROGRAMME AND 
THE GUARDIAN HAS THE UN REACTING 
FURIOUSLY BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT 
CONFISCATED FOOD AID PETER YOU 
ARE STANDING ARE STARTING OFF 
WITH THE INDEPENDENT COVERAGE I I THINK IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY 
ONE WHICH DWARFS WITTERING DOMESTIC 
AGENDA WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 
DEATH TOLL OF UP TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE DISPLACED 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AT RISK FROM 
WATER BORNE DISEASES IT SUITS THE 
INDEPENDENT WITH ITS STRONG SINGLE 
ISSUE OFTEN ENVIRONMENTAL AND 
ISSUE OFTEN ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL AND LED FRONT PAGES THE 
INDEPENDENT HAVE DONE WELL WITH IT 
AND THE INSIDE PAGES OF THE 
GUARDIAN HAVE 
A HEART RENDING 
GUARDIAN HAVE A HEART RENDING PICTURE OF DEAD CHILDREN 
THAT IS A 
GENUINELY SHOCKING PICTURE AS YOU SAY A LOT OF THIS STORY IS REALLY 
COMING HOME WHEN YOU READ THESE 
FIRST HAND ACCOUNTS 
OF SOME 
REPORTERS WHO 
HAVE TRIED 
TO GET 
LAND AND ARE EXPLORING SOME OF THE 
DAMAGE 
YES IT IS A STORY WHICH DAMAGE SUITS THE OLD FASHIONED 
BUCCANEERING FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT 
OFTEN YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WILL GET 
UNDER THE WIRE AND GET IN THERE IT 
SUITS PRINT JOURNALISM BECAUSE THEY 
CAN DO MUCH MORE ANONYMOUSLY AND 
BROADCASTS JOURNALISM FOR EXAMPLE 
IT IS A TRULY HORRIFYING STORY ONE 
WHICH REALLY CHALLENGES THAT OUR 
IDEA OF WHAT INTERNATIONAL 
RELATIONSHIPS ARE IF ONLY THE 
BURMESE GOVERNMENT HAD SHOWN A 
FRACTION OF THE ENERGY THEY HAD PUT 
INTO SUPPRESSING THEIR OWN PEOPLE 
IT IS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY 
ONE OF 
THE LINES IS EMERGING IS THAT 
LOCALS ARE SUGGESTING THAT BODIES 
ARE DISAPPEARING THAT THE MILITARY 
ARE HIDING BORDERS 
IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO TELL IT IS THE BODIES IN THE 
WATER 
THAT ARE CAUSING 
THE DISEASE 
HAS 
HEAVEN KNOWS 
THIS IS BAD 
ENOUGH BUT I SUSPECT THAT THE 
JOINTER WITH DECADES OF POLITICAL 
HABIT 
OF SECRECY 
A 
HABIT THAT 
IS 
HARD TO 
SHAKE OFF ARE AGAIN 
THROWING THEIR INGENUITY INTO 
CONCEALING THE PROBLEM 
FROM COVERAGE OF BURMA TO MORE 
DOMESTIC ISSUES THE TIMES IS 
SERIALISING CHERIE BLAIR S. AUTOBIOGRAPHY 
THIS IS BEING TAKEN AUTOBIOGRAPHY VERY SERIOUSLY AS A POLITICAL 
MEMOIR IT IS THE SORT OF THING 
THAT WOULD TRADITIONALLY BE SAVED 
UP FOR PARTY CONFERENCES IT WOULD 
BE SAVED UP THE SUNDAY NIGHT BEFORE 
THE CONFERENCES BUT NOW IT IS A 
MEASURE OF HOW POLITICAL THE NEWS 
HAS GOT RECENTLY RIGHT NOW IS 
CONSIDER THE CONSIDERED THE PARTY 
CONFERENCE SEASON 
AS ALWAYS YOU 
GET THE VERY DIFFERENT STRANDS THE 
IMPORTANT STUFF IN A WAY WHICH IS 
ON THE FRONT PAGE ABOUT GORDON 
BROWN AND TONY BLAIR WHAT WAS 
GOING ON AND THEN THE DETAILS 
ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS SUCH AS CAROLE 
CAPLIN WHICH IS INTRIGUING MRS. MRS BLAIR SAYING IT WAS HER IDEA THAT 
CAROLE CAPLIN SHOULD GIVE TONY 
BLAIR A MASSAGE TOO MUCH 
INFORMATION THAT WONDERFUL PHOTO 
THE EDITOR HAS CHOSEN THE PHOTO 
THAT MAKES HER LOOK MOST FLOATING 
BASICALLY 
YOU MIGHT SAY THAT BASICALLY OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT SAY SMILING 
THROWING HER HEAD BACK AND LAUGHING 
I WONDER IF THAT IS THE PHOTO SHE 
HERSELF WOULD HAVE CHOSEN 
AND MANY 
ASKING HOW UNCOMFORTABLE GORDON 
BROWN WILL BE FEELING ESPECIALLY ESPECIALLY THE CLAIM THAT TONY BLAIR IS 
ADVISING HIM 
AND THE STUFF THAT I 
READ THERE IS THEME ALL THROUGH 
HER LIFE ABOUT AN OBSESSION WITH 
MONEY 
SHE HAS 
COME UP THE HARD WAY AND IT 
IS A BIT OF A MAN'S WORLD IN POLITICS AND MEDIA 
YOU DON'T 
COME 
UP THE 
HARD WAY 
BY BEING 
NICE 
THE TIME THERE 
IS SCOPE 
TO 
BE A 
LITTLE KINDER 
TO CHERIE 
BLAIR 
PAPERS THAT HAVE NOT GONE INTO THE 
STORY HAVE GONE INTO SPOILER MODE 
THE DAILY MAIL HAS VERY 
MISCHIEVOUS STORY BUT IT IS SPOILER 
CENTRAL CENTRAL LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE STORY 
ABOUT THIS MAN WHO GOT THROWN INTO 
A CELL FOR DROPPING AN APPLE CORE 
THIS IS POLITICAL 
GONE MAD 
STORY 
DROPPING AN 
APPLE 
L. 
THOUGHT APPLES 
WERE BY A GROUP 
BIODEGRADABLE 
LOTS OF PEOPLE BIODEGRADABLE JUSTIFY IT ON THAT BASIS 
IT IS A 
DIFFERENT MATTER FROM THROWING AWAY 
A BURGER BOX 
I THINK THEY TAKE A 
LONG TIME AND IN THE STILL 
DO NOT LOOK NICE 
HE GOT INTO 
SERIOUS TROUBLE I SORT 
OF DON'T 
BLAME HIM BECAUSE HE WAS WITH A 
FIFTY ON THE SPOT 
FINE FROM 
SOMEONE WHO 
WAS 
NOT A 
POLICE 
OFFICER 
BUT A 
POLICE COMMUNITY 
SUPPORT OFFICER 
WHICH IS NOT THE 
SAME THING PROBABLY THE MANN 
THOUGHT THAT HE WAS BEING OVER 
ZEALOUS AND HEAVY HANDED SOME GUY 
WHO 
PROBABLY RECOGNISES ME PROBABLY WORKS DOWN THE STREET IT IT IS ONE 
OF THOSE 
SITUATIONS 
YOU CAN 
IMAGINE HAPPENING 
IN THE 
STREET 
TEMPERS STARTING TO FLOWER EXACTLY EXACTLY IN THE TRADITIONAL MANNER GO AND 
CATCH SOME BURGLARS MATE CRIMINALISE THE PEOPLE THEY CAN IT TENDS

THE BEIJING HOPEFULS GOT THREE NEW 
WORLD RECORDS THE MEN'S TEAM 
SPRINT BROKE THE FIFTY SECOND BARRIER FOR 
THE FIRST TIME 
THIS WAS THE WOMEN'S BLIND AND 
VISUALLY IMPAIRED TANDEM PURSUED 
THEY BROKE THE WORLD RECORD THERE

MORE ON THAT ON THE B. B. C. THROUGHOUT 
THE WEEKEND IT'S A BUSY WEEK OF 
MOTOR SPORT AHEAD WITH THE 
REARRANGED ROUND FOUR OF THE 
SUPERBIKES NEXT WEEKEND ALSO IT 
IS THE EUROPEAN DRIFT CHAMPIONSHIP 
AT KNOCKHILL NEAR EDINBURGH 
A BURNING DESIRE TO BE DIFFERENT 
IN ANY OTHER KIND OF MOTOR SPORT 
IF YOU HAVE SKIDDED YOUR CAR LIKE 
THAT AT ONE HUNDRED M. P. H. YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY 
MADE A MISTAKE OR MISJUDGED A 
CORNER BUT THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT 
IN DRIFTING WHICH IS WHY THEY GET 
THROUGH A SET OF TYRES EVERY FIVE 
MINUTES IT STARTED IN JAPAN IN THE 
NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND IN THE LAST DECADE IT'S 
GONE WORLDWIDE WITH EUROPEAN AND 
BRITISH CHAMPIONSHIP EVENTS NOW 
HELD HERE UP ON THE CLUTCH THAT'S 
IT IT I WAS GIVEN MY FIRST BEEN BY THE 
REIGNING EUROPEAN CHAMPION STOP STOP THERE A MINUTE ARE YOU GETTING 
DIZZY 
YOU'RE DRIFTING WHEN YOUR DIZZY FRONT WHEELS ARE POINTING ONE WAY 
AND THE CAR IS TURNING THE OTHER 
IT'S DIFFERENT FROM EVERYTHING ELSE 
YOU'VE LEARNT FROM WHEN YOU START 
TO DRIVE YOU BUILD UP SPEED AND 
THE NEW KIND OF THROW THE CAR INTO 
A SIDEWARDS MOTION 
FOR BEGINNERS THIS IS SUCH A 
STRANGE CONCEPT TO LEARN 
REALLY GO 
FOR IT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANY 
DAMAGE THAT'S IT MORE REVS IN IN NEXT WEEK'S EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP 
ROUND AT KNOCKHILL NEAR EDINBURGH 
DRIVERS WILL BE JUDGED ON THEIR 
SPEED THE ANGLE THEY TAKE AND HOW 
SPECTACULAR THEIR DRIFT LOOKS THE 
MORE SMOKE THE BETTER 
IT'S LIKE A 
REAL LIFE COMPUTER GAME EXCITING 
ACTION ONE HUNDRED M. P. H. PLUS 
IT IS THE 
MOST INTENSE ADRENALIN RUSH BUT 
HOPES OF A HIGH SCORE CAN SOMETIMES 
COME TO A SUDDEN END 
I THINK THE 
LIGHT HAS COME OFF 
WELL DONE I THINK YOU CAN SEE WHY 
IT HAS BEEN COMPARED TO ICE SKATING 
IN CARS BECAUSE YOU ARE JUDGED 
PARTLY APPARENTLY ON THE REACTION 
OF THE CROWD WHAT WAS THE CROWD 
REACTION WHEN YOU WERE AT THE 
WHEEL 
WELL THERE WAS A BIG WHEEL REACTION FROM THE DRIVER MORE ON 
OUR WEBSITE 
MIKE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED 
WE WILL SEE YOU LATER ON IT'S 
ILLEGAL TO SELL ALCOHOL OR THE 
LIVES OF ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN 
BUT WHEN THEY ARE BOUGHT ONLINE 
THERE ARE NO LAWS FORCING INTERNET 
RETAILERS TO PROVE THEIR CUSTOMERS 
ARE OLD ENOUGH NEXT WEEK BILL 
TO TRY TO RECTIFY THAT NO GET 
ANOTHER READING IN THE HOUSE OF 
COMMONS BUT COULD NEW RULES ON AGE 
VERIFICATION BE MADE TO WORK OUR 
BUSINESS REPORT HAS MORE DEAN AND 
LIKE MANY YOUNG PEOPLE HE IS AN 
AVID USER OF THE INTERNET MANY 
TEENAGERS USE THE WEB TO 
COMMUNICATE WITH EACH EACH OTHER 
AND TO BUY STUFF ONLINE 
ALEXANDER IS SIXTEEN PEOPLE CAN BUY 
ALCOHOL GUNS EVEN ONE OF MY 
FRIENDS HE BOUGHT SOME ALCOHOL 
ONLINE AND IT WAS VERY EASY TO BUY 
IT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T CHECK HIS 
AGE HE JUST PUT THE DETAILS FROM 
THE CARD ON TO THE COMPUTER AND HE 
JUST BOUGHT IT IN SECONDS 
CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO MANDATORY 
LAWS FORCING ONLINE RETAILERS TO 
VERIFY WHETHER SOMEONE IS OLD 
ENOUGH TO BE SOLD PRODUCTS LIKE 
ALCOHOL OR KNIVES BETTING FIRMS 
THOUGH OR OBLIGED TO CHECK SOMEONE 
IS OLD ENOUGH TO GAMBLE ONLINE AND 
THEY ARE INCREASINGLY USING THE 
LATEST SOFTWARE TO VERIFY 
CUSTOMERS' AGES SO HOW DOES THE

THERE IS EVIDENCE 
THERE IS

QUESTION A 
STORY 
A MAN WHOSE SEVERED FINGER GREW 
BACK WELCOME THIS WEEK THE PIXIE DUST 
THAT REGROUP AND MISSING FINGER 
FACT OR FAIRY TALE ON THE ELECTION 
COVERAGE THAT SOME VIEWERS THOUGHT 
DESCENDED INTO FARCE THERE IS 
LITTLE NEWS BULLETINS LIKE BETTER 
THAN A STORY ABOUT MEDICAL ADVANCES 
LAST WEEK THERE WAS A STORY ABOUT A 
MAN WHOSE FINGER GROUP BACK AFTER 
APPLYING A SPECIAL POWDER 
MADE FROM 
PIG 
BLADDER CELLS 
IT WAS DEEMED 
THE MOST SECOND SECOND MOST 
IMPORTANT STORY 
IT TOOK MY FINGER 
OFF WE NEVER DID FIND THE PIECE OF 
FINGER 
HOW MUCH 
FROM BLUE THAT FINGER MUCH 
MIRACLE MAN SPRINKLES MIRACLE MUCH POWDER ON HIS FINGER 
THEY CALL 
IT PIXIE DUST NORMALLY WHEN WE 
NORMALLY WHEN WE ARE WOUNDED WE SCARF OTHER 
SCIENTISTS SAYING PUT PUTTING THE 
CELLULAR MATRIX ON THE ROAD WOUND 
STIMULATES THE CELLS TO REGROW 
BUT A FEW VIEWERS WERE NOT 
CONVINCED PROFESSOR KEITH VASS 
SAID HE HAD A SIMILAR INJURY 
GEOFF BOOTH POINTED OUT THE STORY 
HAD BEEN REPORTED TWICE BEFORE IN 
FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND AGAIN EARLIER 
THIS YEAR 
MATTHEW PRICE YOU DID THE ORIGINAL 
STORY YOU ARE JOINING US FROM NEW 
YORK FIRST OF ALL WHY DID YOU 
COVER THE 
STORY WHEN YOU 
DID IT 
SEEMS 
TO BE 
AN OLD STORY SIMPLY 
BECAUSE IT 
IS 
NOT THIS 
IS A PRESS 
RELEASE THAT 
CAME OUT 
ON 
APRIL SEVENTEENTH 
FROM THE U. S. MILITARY AND I WILL 
READ SOMETHING FROM IT THE 
OVERRIDING GOAL AND THIS IS QUITE 
INTERESTING IN THE SUBJECT OF OUR 
DISCUSSION IS TO HEAL THE BATTLE 
FEEL WOUNDED WITH WHAT 
MAY SOUND 
LIKE 
SCIENCE FICTION 
THEY 
GO ON 
TO 
SAY THEY 
ARE LOOKING 
AT 
REGENERATION HAVE LOST LIMBS 
RESTORING HOLES IN SCHOOLS AND 
HEALING BONES TO NOT JUST REFORM 
BUT FUNCTION THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT 
STORY AND IT IS OF SIGNIFICANCE NOW 
WEATHER GRAPHICS OVER 
EGG IT 
APPEARED TO BE A FINGER 
REGENERATING 
FROM HALF 
THE 
WAY DOWN 
ITS LENGTH WITH JOINT MISSING THAT 
IS IMPOSSIBLE ISN'T IT AS AS ABSOLUTELY THAT GRAPHIC WAS 
NOT AS 
ACCURATE AS 
IT SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN 
CLEARLY SHOWED 
THE FINGER 
GROWING 
FROM HERE 
ALL WAY UP THAT IS NOT 
HAPPENING THE GRAPHIC SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN A VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF HOW 
SCIENTISTS BELIEVE AND 
EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX MIGHT WORK IN 
STIMULATING THE BODY'S ALREADY 
POTENTIAL TO REGROW SOME OF ITS 
CELLS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I 
WOULD HOLD 
MY HAND UP 
AND SAY 
ABSOLUTELY THAT 
GRAPHIC 
WAS NOT 
AS 
ACCURATE AS 
IT 
SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN 
SOME PEOPLE SAY 
THE B. B. C. 
DOES NOT 
TAKE SCIENCE SERIOUSLY ENOUGH WERE 
YOU 
HAPPY WITH 
THIS 
COVERAGE THAT 
IT DIDN'T 
GIVE 
IT DIDN'T GIVE MISLEADING IMPRESSIONS AND FALSE HOPE TO 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
LOST HALF 
IT IS 
RIGHT TO 
SAY 
THERE WERE 
PARTS THAT WERE 
ON HELPFUL 
TO THE 
STORY THE 
GRAPHICS THE 
WAY IN 
GENERAL 
THAT GLOBAL 
MEDIA PICKED 
UP 
ON THE STORY WAS POTENTIALLY 
UNHELPFUL HEADLINES LIKE MAN GROWS 
BACK HIS FINGER WITH PIXIE DUST 
THEY ARE NOT 
HELPFUL AND 
WE 
DID NOT 
WRITE THEM HERE THE BROADER POINT 
IS THIS WAS THE 
B. B. C. HOOKS 
AND 
REELED INTO SOME MAKE BELIEVE STORY 
BY SOME FICTITIOUS AFRICAN STYLE 
FRANKENSTEIN STYLE SCIENTISTS 
ABSOLUTELY NOT L. AM NOT A SCIENCE 
SPECIALIST BUT I AM A JOURNALIST 
WITH FIFTEEN YEARS' EXPERIENCE AND I 
APPROACHED THIS 
STORY IN 
NO 
APPROACHED THIS STORY IN NO WAY DIFFERENT FROM 
ANY OTHER 
STORY IT 
WAS FULLY RESEARCHED AND I STAND BY 
IT IT ELECTION NIGHT HAVE TRADITIONALLY 
BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE B. B. C. TO 
ITS ATEST 
GRAPHICS 
LAST 
WEEK WAS 
NO EXCEPTION HOWEVER 
THE ATTEMPTS TO JAZZ UP COVERAGE MOSTLY FEATURING JEREMY 
VINE DIDN'T IMPRESS MANY OF YOU 
THIS IS 
THE SHOOT OUT 
SALOON 
I AM 
LOOKING 
FOR A 
POLITICIAN TO 
TRY MY 
SHOOTING SKILLS ON L. FANCY THAT 
MIGHT JUST BE THE LEADER OF THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS LADY BOY ARE 
YOU IN TOWN 
WE ALSO HAD THE 
CONSERVATIVES PORTRAYED AS EVOLVE 
RING FROM AN ELECTORAL CROUCHING 
APE TO DAVID CAMERON S. UPRIGHT 
LEADERSHIP SOME VIEWERS WERE 
UNDERWHELMED 
THE ELECTION AUDIENCE UNDERWHELMED DOES NOT REQUIRE GIMMICKS WE ARE 
INTERESTED ENOUGH IN POLITICS TO 
STAY UP UNTIL THREE A M. IT WAS AS 
IF THE 
B. B. C. 
THOUGHT THE 
PLEBS 
WOULD NOT 
BE 
INTERESTED IN 
THE STRAIGHT

WE HAVE TAKEN 
THAT ON

THIS 
CASE IS 
TO 
LOOK AT 
THE 
PROGRAMME IN 
ITS 
ENTIRETY WHICH 
PROGRAMME IN ITS ENTIRETY WHICH WAS A VERY SERIOUS PROGRAMME 
PRESENTED BY DAVID DIMBLEBY WE 
ALSO HAD 
THE POLITICAL 
EDITORS OF 
THE 
B. B. C.'S NATIONS 
AND REGIONS ON 
WELL IT WAS FIVE HOURS BROADCASTING 
A VERY 
SERIOUS PROGRAMME AND 
THIS WAS 
A 
SMALL PART OF IT FURTHERMORE OF THOSE 
OF WHAT JEREMY 
VINE WAS 
DOING 
DID A NUMBER OF SERIOUS GRAPHICS 
WHICH EXPLAINED COMPLEX ISSUES LIKE 
HISTORICAL CONTEXT WE TAKE 
IT ON 
BOARD 
BUT IT 
WAS 
A SMALL 
PART OF 
THE PROGRAMME DOZENS OF CLEARLY DID 
NOT LIKE 
IT 
THERE 
WAS 
THERE A 
SENSE THAT 
WAS THERE A SENSE THAT LOCAL ELECTIONS WERE 
CONSIDERED TOO 
ELECTIONS WERE CONSIDERED TOO BORING TO RUN 
STRAIGHT ON 
THE B. B. C. 
NO NOT AT ALL WE WOULD NOT HAVE 
BROADCAST FROM ELEVEN THIRTY P. M. UNTIL FOUR THIRTY AM 
IF WE

ALLEGATIONS OF THE B. B. C. NEWS 
DUMBING DOWN 
IS NOTHING 
NEW 
DUMBING DOWN IS NOTHING NEW BUT HAVE A LOOK AT 
THIS LAST 
MONTH A 
REPORT TO SHOCK A BUCKET ILLUSTRATE A 
STORY ABOUT 
THE 
BANK OF SCOTLAND AND SHOWING 
POLITICIANS 
WALKING BACKWARDS 
TO 
SHOW A 
RETREAT 
OVER THE 
TEN P. TAX 
RATE PROMPTED PETER PHILLIPS TO 
WRITE 
THE AVERAGE CHINESE PERSON IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR JUST THREE AND ONE HALF TONNES 
OF CARBON A YEAR SO WE REPRESENT 
THAT WITH 
ONE BOWL 
OF RICE 
BUT 
AVERAGE 
WESTERNER IS 
RESPONSIBLE 
AVERAGE WESTERNER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THREE 
TIMES AS 
MUCH CARBON SO 
WE REPRESENT 
THAT WITH THREE BALLS 
OF RICE 
AFTER WATCHING THAT REPORT DAVID DONNE SAID 
WHAT ARE THE LATEST FIGURES TELL 
US IT IS THE TIP OF AN 
ICEBERG AND 
US A 
PRETTY BIG 
ICEBERG 
A PRETTY BIG ICEBERG THAT LED ONE VIEWER TO COMMENT 
MATTHEW WOOD SAW THIS REPORT ABOUT 
TURMOIL IN FINANCIAL MARKETS 
IT USED PICTURES OF FIREWORKS TO 
SHOW THERE THE MARKET HAD BEEN 
HAVING A 
PARTY AND 
EMPTY 
TO SHOW THE PARTY WAS OVER HE 
WROTE IS THERE A DANGER YOU ARE 
TRIVIALISING THE NEWS BY USING 
CHILDISH METHODS OF ILLUSTRATING 
IT IT I AM NOT SURE I WOULD 
USE THE 
WORD 
BIZARRE I 
REACT STRONGLY WHEN WE DO 
TREATMENTS 
TO NEWS 
BUT 
OFTEN IT 
NOT UNUSUAL 
TO USE 
THEM 
AND WHEN 
DO IT 
IS OFTEN 
ON 
STORIES THAT 
PICTURES OR 
WHICH HAVE 
AN ISSUE 
ABOUT ENGAGING OR EXPLAINING 
SOMETHING I 
CAN SEE 
THAT BUT SOMETHING ILLUSTRATING RELATIVE CARBON 
IMPRINTS FOOTPRINTS 
WITH BOWLS OF 
RICE YOU CAN 
SEE WHY 
THAT WOULD 
ANNOYED 
VIEWERS CAN'T 
YOU I'M 
ANNOYED VIEWERS CAN'T YOU I'M GLAD 
YOU PICKED 
UP 
ON THAT 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO SEE IT CONTEXT THAT 
WAS AN 
ANALOGY USED 
BY THE CHINESE MINISTER FOR EVERY 
BOWL OF RICE THAT CHINA USES IN 
POLLUTION AMERICA USES THREE 
PEOPLE ALL THE TIME 
USE ANALOGIES 
TO 
EXPLAIN THINGS 
AND IT 
IS THE 
SAME IN 
USE WHEN 
IT 
IS A 
DIFFICULT 
CONCEPT 
TO GET 
ACROSS 
THEN WE 
WILL 
USE ANALOGIES 
SOMETIMES SOME 
USE ANALOGIES SOMETIMES SOME PEOPLE 
MAY FEEL 
IT GOES TOO FAR 
NEED TO 
TAKE THAT 
ON 
BOARD AND 
LISTEN TO 
IT 
BUT WE 
ALSO 
WANT TO 
IN A 
WORLD WHERE 
PRODUCERS ARE 
ABLE 
TO SEEK 
OUT WAYS OF ENGAGING THE 
AUDIENCE 
THE ICEBERG ISN'T THAT AUDIENCE MERELY DISTRACTING 
THAT EXAMPLE 
IT IS A RULE WE WOULD NORMALLY TRY 
NOT TO 
DO SO 
I 
ACCEPT THAT 
TOTALLY 
BUT WE 
ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT 
BUT WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT B. B. C. NEWS 
IS GOING THROUGH A 
B. B. C. NEWS IS GOING THROUGH A RENAISSANCE AT THE MOMENT THE 
AUDIENCES ARE 
GOING UP 
AND 
REACTION OVERALL 
IS POSITIVE

GOOD MORNING WELCOME TO BREAKFAST 
FROM B. B. C. NEWS WITH CHARLIE STAYT 
AND SUSANNA REID 
A GROWING CRISIS IN BURMA THE 
FIRST UN TRUCKS HAVE BEEN ALLOWED 
INTO THE THE COUNTRY BUT THERE ARE 
WARNINGS FAR MORE AID IS NEEDED 
GOOD MORNING IT'S SATURDAY TENTH 
MAY MAY ALSO ON TODAY'S PROGRAMME 
THE BIG EXAM CRAM HEAD TEACHERS 
SAY PUPILS ARE BEING ASKED TO SIT 
TOO MANY TESTS IN SINGLE DAY AND 
IT COULD AFFECT THEIR RESULTS 
CONNING CUSTOMERS ON THE DOORSTEP 
NPOWER IS TOLD TO GET GRIP AND 
CRACK DOWN ON DODGY SALES PEOPLE 
THE HELPING HAND CHERIE BLAIR SAYS 
HER HUSBAND IS ADVISING GORDON 
BROWN ON HOW TO WIN THE NEXT 
ELECTION ON THE SKIDS MIKE 
BUSHELL DRIFTS HIS WAY INTO THE 
LATEST MOTOR RACING CRAZE 
AND THE WINNER OF THE ALBUM OF THE 
YEAR AWARD BLAKE 
BLAKE ARE 
WINNERS AT THE CLASSICAL BRITS AND 
WILL BE SINGING LIVE ON BREAKFAST 
THIS MORNING 
FIRST OUR MAIN STORY THE FIRST TWO 
UN AID TRUCKS HAVE BEEN ALLOWED 
INTO BURMA THEY CROSSED THE THAI 
BORDER CARRYING TENTS TO PROVIDE 
SHELTER IN THE WAKE OF LAST WEEK'S 
CYCLONE BUT THERE ARE WARNINGS 
THAT MORE PEOPLE WILL DIE UNLESS 
THERE'S A BIG INCREASE IN AID 
SUPPLIES MEANWHILE THERE ARE 
REPORTS OF FURTHER DELAYS IN 
ALLOWING FOREIGN RELIEF WORKERS 
INTO THE COUNTRY MANY ARE STILL 
WAITING FOR VISAS 
WITH THREE MORE AID FLIGHTS DUE TO 
ARRIVE TODAY THERE ARE SIGNS AT 
LAST THAT THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT IS 
RESPONDING TO THE PRESSURE TO ALLOW 
MORE SUPPLIES INTO THE COUNTRY BUT 
THERE'S NO SIGN OF A BREAKTHROUGH 
OVER FOREIGN AID WORKERS APPLYING 
FOR VISAS REMAINS A SLOW PROCESS 
WE APPLIED FOR SIXTEEN SO FAR IN THE 
IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE CYCLONE 
AND SO FAR ONLY ONE HAS BEEN 
GRANTED IT IS IMMENSELY 
FRUSTRATING DOING IT REMOTE 
CONTROL FROM THE COUNTRY NEXT DOOR 
IS DOABLE BUT IT HAS PUT AN 
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PRESSURE ON OUR 
STAFF ALREADY IN THE FIELD 
IN THE 
MEANTIME THE PEOPLE OF BOGALAY AND 
IRRAWADDY DELTA DO WHAT THEY CAN TO 
SURVIVE THIS LOW LYING REGION BORE 
THE BRUNT OF LAST WEEK'S STORM IT 
SHOULD BE THE FOCUS OF A HUGE AID 
OPERATION BUT THE HELP GETTING IN 
IS JUST A DROP IN THE OCEAN OF 
WHAT'S NEEDEDBURMA APPEARS TO 
REMAIN INSISTENT IT WILL DISTRIBUTE 
SUPPLIES ITSELF STAGE MANAGED FOET 
CALLS ON STATE RUN TELEVISION SHOW 
A GOVERNMENT IN CONTROL OF THE 
CRISIS BUT EXPERTS SAY THE SCALE 
OF THE DISASTER IS TOO VAST TO BE 
HANDLED ALONE IN FACT THE MINDS 
OF THE MILITARY LEADERS WILL BE 
DISTRACTED THIS WEEKEND BY A 
REFERENDUM ON THE COUNTRY'S 
CONSTITUTION DESPITE WORLDWIDE 
CALLS TO POSTPONE THE VOTE THE 
GOVERNMENT IS CONTINUING WITH PLANS 
FOR CHANGES THAT WOULD FURTHER 
STRENGTHEN THE JUNTA'S GRIP ON 
POWER PUSHING THE REST OF THE 
WORLD EVEN FURTHER AWAY LET'S 
SPEAK TO OUR CORRESPONDENT DAN 
GRIFFITHS WHO IS' ON THE THAI 
BURMESE BORDER 
A COUPLE OF AGENCY TRUCKS GETTING 
IN WHAT HAVE THEY GOT ON THEM AND 
ARE THE AID WORKERS ALLOWED TO GO 
IN WITH THEM 
THAT'S RIGHT TWO 
TRUCKS FROM THE UN H. C. R. CROSSED THE 
BRIDGE BEHIND ME OVER INTO BURMA 
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO THEY WERE 
CARRYING TENTS AND PLASTIC SHEETING 
WHICH THE U. N. H. C. R. TELL US WILL BE 
ENOUGH TO PROVIDE SHELTER FOR 
AROUND TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE OF COURSE 
THAT'S A TINY AMOUNT OF AID 
COMPARED WITH WHAT IS NEEDED OVER 
THERE AT THE MOMENT WHAT'S 
INTERESTING AS WELL IS THAT THE 
U. N. H. C. R. FOREIGN AID WORKERS WEREN'T 
TRAVELLING WITH THOSE TRUCKS EITHER 
THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO OVER 
IT'S JUST THOSE TWO LORRIES DON'T 
FORGET THEY'LL TAKE AROUND TWO 
DAYS JUST TO GET TO RANGOON IT 
GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE CHALLENGE 
FACING THE INTERNATIONAL AID 
COMMUNITY EVEN IN DISTRIBUTING THE 
AID ONCE THEY'VE GOT IT OVER THE 
BORDER INTO BURMA 
WHAT ACTUALLY 
HAPPENS THEN IF THESE TRUCKS 
SEARCHLY GO IN WITH DRIVERS AND NO 
SIMPLY GO IN WITH DRIVERS AND NO 
OTHER AID WORKERS INVOLVED WHAT 
DOES THE UN ASSUME WILL HAPPEN TO 
THAT AID ONCE IT GETS THERE I I THINK THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF 
FINGER CROSSING AT THE MOMENT L. 
WAS SPEAKING TO ONE U. N. H. C. R. 
REPRESENTATIVE HERE WHERE I AM ON 
THE BORDER BETWEEN THAILAND AND 
BURMA SHE WAS SAYING THEY TRY TO 
KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE DRIVERS BY 
MOBILE PHONE BUT COMMUNICATIONS 
THERE ARE VERY BAD AS WELL SO I 
THINK AS I SAY THEY'RE CROSSING 
THEIR FINGERS AND HOPING THAT THE 
AID WILL MAKE IT THROUGH TO RANGOON 
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS' TIME BUT THAT 
WON'T BE OF COURSE UNTIL MONDAY 
OR TUESDAY 
ONCE THEY'VE GOT IT THERE THEN 
THEY FACE THE CHALLENGE OF 
DISTRIBUTING IT AS WELL 
REALLY A NUMBER OF HURDLES STILL 
BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN GET THE AID TO 
THE PEOPLE THAT NEED IT THE MOST 
WHAT IS THE PICTURE WHERE YOU ARE 
IS IT A SITUATION WHERE THERE ARE 
TRUCKS LINING UP SIMPLY WAITING FOR 
PERMISSION TO GO IN WHAT'S GOING 
ON 
CERTAINLY THERE IS MORE AID ON WAITING TO GO IN AGAIN THE U. N. H. C. R. 
EXPERIENCES ARE INDICATIVE OF THE 
PROBLEMS THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO 
GET THE PAPERWORK SORTED TO GET 
ACROSS THE BORDER FOR NEARLY A WEEK 
NOW OF COURSE THEY WANTED TO MAKE 
SURE THEY HAD ALL THAT PAPERWORK IN 
BUT CERTAINLY IT SEEMS THAT 
RED TAPE HERE IS HOLDING UP IS 
CAUSING A LOT OF PROBLEMS AS WELL 
AS THE FACT OF COURSE THAT 
BURMA'S MILITARY LEADERS DO APPEAR 
VERY RELUCTANT TO ALLOW LARGE 
AMOUNTS OF AID IN AS YOU WERE 
SAYING SMALL AMOUNTS ARE GETTING 
IN BUT NOWHERE NEAR ON THE SCALE 
THAT THE INTERNATIONAL AID AGENCIES 
SAY IS NEEDED IF THEY'RE GOING TO 
HELP ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
LEFT HOMELESS BY THIS CYCLONE 
THE PRESSURE IS ON FOR THOUSANDS OF 
SCHOOLCHILDREN AS THE EXAM SEASON 
IS UPON US IT'S DIFFICULT TIME 
BUT TEACHING UNIONS SAY IT'S BEEN 
MADE WORSE BY WHAT THEY CALL EXAM 
CONGESTION SOME PUPILS WILL HAVE 
TO SPEND UP TO SEVEN HOURS SITTING 
THREE OR FOUR EXAMS IN A SINGLE DAY 
THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HEAD 
TEACHERS HAS TOLD BREAKFAST THE 
PILE UP IS GETTING WORSE AND COULD 
AFFECT PUPILS' RESULTS 
WITH THE MAIN EXAM SEASON STARTING 
ON MONDAY STRESS LEVELS IN SCHOOLS 
ARE RATCHETING UP BUT THIS YEAR IT 
HAS BEEN MADE WORSE ACCORDING TO 
TEACHING UNIONS BY EXAM CONGESTION 
WHERE PUPILS HAVE THEIR EXAMS 
CRAMMED TOGETHER AND IN MANY CASES 
EVEN CLASHING 
STUDENTS ARE NOW STUDYING MORE 
SUBJECTS THAT MEANS MORE EXAMS 
MORE LEVELS AND MORE MODULES AT 
THE HEIGHT OF THE EXAM SEASON 
STUDENTS CAN BE SITTING IN 
EXAMINATIONS FOR AS MUCH AS SEVEN 
HOURS A DAY THESE A LEVEL STUDENTS 
HAVE EXAMS SO TIGHTLY PACKED THEY 
BELIEVE THEIR RESULTS WILL BE 
AFFECTED 
I HAVE WEDNESDAY AFFECTED THURSDAY AND FRIDAY NINE EXAMS 
YOU FEEL BY THE TIME YOU'VE GOT TO 
YOUR LAST SUBJECT YOU'RE PUTTING IN 
LESS EFFORT THAN YOU WAS AT THE 
BEGINNING A ZERO ZERO BECAUSE IT'S THREE HUNDRED 
IN THE AFTERNOON AND YOU'RE STILL 
SITTING IN EXAM CONDITIONS IT 
AFFECTS THE FINAL GRADE YOU GET 
PUPILS THAT HAVE GOT THEIR 
TIMETABLE MORE SPREAD OUT HAVE MORE 
OF AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY GET 
MORE TIME TO REVISE FOR EACH 
SUBJECT AND THE PRESSURE IS NOT ON 
BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T GOT ALL THOSE 
EXAMS CRAMMED INTO ONE DAY THE THE PROBLEMS WE'RE FINDING IS THAT 
WE'RE GETTING A BUNCHING OF EXAMS 
IN ONE DAY PUPILS CAN BE SITTING 
THREE EXAMS IN ONE DAY THE EFFECT 
THAT CAN HAVE ON THEM IS THAT 
THEY'RE MENTALLY EXHAUSTED BY THE 
LAST EXAM 
TEACHING UNIONS SAY THE LOG JAM OF 
EXAMS IS GETTING WORSE WHICH IS 
CAUSING UNACCEPTABLE STRESS LEVELS 
IN PUPILS 
THE EXAM BOARDS NEED TO DO EVEN 
MORE TO BEST CO ORDINATE THEIR 
EFFORTS SO THAT YOUNGSTERS DON'T 
HAVE THIS PROBLEM OF THREE AND FOUR 
EXAMINATIONS ON ONE DAY WHICH IS 
CLEARLY ASKING TOO MUCH OF ANY 
ANYBODY IT CAN'T ENCOURAGE THE 
BEST PERFORMANCE BY THEM 
THE JOINT 
COUNCIL FOR QUALIFICATIONS 
REPRESENTS THE XM BODIES IT SAYS 
IT HAS A DIFFICULT XM BODIES IT 
SAYS IT HAS A DIFFICULT JOB TRYING 
TO 
TO CRAM ALL THE EXAMINATIONS 
THE EXAM LOG JAM IS LIKELY TO GET 
EVEN WORSE NEXT YEAR AS NEW AND OLD 
A LEVEL SYSTEMS OVERLAP WITH A 
LEVEL RESULTS NEEDED IN TIME FOR 
UNIVERSITY ALLOCATIONS THERE IS NO 
SCOPE TO EXTEND THE EXAM PERIOD 
EXAM CONGESTION AND STRESS LEVELS 
IN MAY AND JUNE WILL CONTINUE TO 
RISE RISE JUST A REMINDER WE'LL BE TALKING 
TO THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HEAD 
TEACHERS ABOUT EXAM CONGESTION IN A 
FEW MINUTES 
THE SELLING TACTICS OF ONE OF 
BRITAIN'S BIGGEST ENERGY COMPANIES 
HAVE BEEN STRONGLY CRITICISED BY 
THE INDUSTRY WATCHDOG ENERGY WATCH 
SAY NPOWER MUST STAMP OUT THE 
WIDESPREAD MISSELLING BY ITS DOOR 
TO DOOR SALES TEAM THE COMPANY HAS 
DISMISSED A HANDFUL OF AGENTS AFTER 
A NEWSPAPER INVESTIGATION BUT 
BREAKFAST HAS DISCOVERED THEY'RE 
NOT ISOLATED INCIDENTS 
MORE ON THAT STORY IN TEN MINUTES 
TONY BLAIR IS ADVISING GORDON BROWN 
ON HOW TO WIN THE NEXT ELECTION 
THAT'S ACCORDING TO CHERIE BLAIR 
WHOSE AUTO BIOGRAPHY IS BEING 
SERIALISED IN THE TIMES NEWSPAPER 
FROM TODAY SHE ALSO SUGGESTS MR. 
BROWN WAS RATTLING THE KEYS OF 
DOWNING STREET IN THE HOPE OF 
GETTING THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER 
OUT OF OFFICE BEFORE THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
ELECTION ELECTION SHE'S NEVER BEEN AFRAID TO SPEAK 
HER MIND 
I DON'T THINK I'LL MISS 
YOU YOU NOW CHERIE BLAIR HAS REVEALED THE 
LOVE HATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HER 
HUSBAND AND THE MAN WHO USED TO 
LIVE NEXT DOOR GORDON BROWN IN AN 
INTERVIEW IN TODAY'S TIMES MRS. 
BLAIR DISCLOSES THAT TONY BLAIR IS 
IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH THE PRIME 
MINISTER AND IS GIVING HIM ADVICE 
ON HOW TO WIN THE NEXT LECTION SHE SAYS 
HOWEVER SHE ALSO CLAIMS THAT HER 
HUSBAND MIGHT HAVE STOOD DOWN IN 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE BUT FOR THE FACT THAT HE FELT 
GORDON BROWN WAS TRYING TO PUSH HIM 
OUT OF OFFICE 
MRS. BLAIR HAS CHOSEN TO GIVE HER 
ACCOUNT OF THE BLAIR BROWN YEARS 
NOW BECAUSE HER AUTO BIOGRAPHY 
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF IS BEING 
PUBLISHED NEXT WEEK HER ANTIPATHY 
TOWARDS GORDON BROWN HAS BEEN ONE 
OF WESTMINSTER'S WORST KEPT SECRETS 
AND SOMETHING OF A STANDING JOKE 
AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY 
ABOUT HER RUNNING OFF WITH THE 
BLOKE NEXT DOORBUT 
LAST NIGHT 
CHERIE BLAIR'S PUBLISHERS INSISTED 
THE DECISION TO BRING THE 
PUBLICATION FORWARD WASN'T AN 
ATTEMPT TO ADD TO GORDON BROWN'S 
CURRENT WOES THEY SAID IT HAPPENED 
BECAUSE THE BOOK WAS FINISHED EARLY 
LAST NIGHT DOWNING STREET SAID IT 
WOULDN'T BE COMMENTING ON THE BOOK 
BUT CONFIRMED THE TWO MEN DO TALK 
REGULARLY 
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY PASSENGERS WERE FORCED TO 
STAY IN A TRAIN STATION IN ONTARIO 
IN CANADA AFTER A WOMAN DIED AND 
SEVERAL PEOPLE FELL ILL WITH FLU 
LIKE SYMPTONS THE TRAIN WAS 
QUARANTINED WHILE THE AUTHORITIES 
INVESTIGATED THE ILLNESS BUT 
OFFICIALS SAID THERE WAS NO 
OUTBREAK OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE 
SEVEN HUNDRED COUPLES WITH A COMBINED TOTAL 
OF OVER FORTY THREE THOUSAND YEARS OF MARRIAGE 
WILL BE CELEBRATING THEIR WEDDING 
ANNIVERSARIES AT A SPECIAL MASS IN 
WESTMINSTER CATHEDRAL LATER TODAY

CARDINAL CORMAC MURPHY O'CONNOR 
INVITED HUSBANDS AND WIVES MARKING

MARRIED FOR MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS IN 
HALF AN HOUR'S TIME WE'LL BE 
SPEAKING TO ONE OF THE COUPLES 
ANDING THE CEREMONY CELEBRATING 
THEIR FORTIETH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY 
THAT'S RUBY ISN'T IT 
THAT'S RIGHT 
NOW NPOWER ONE OF THE U. K.'S 
BIGGEST ENERGY COMPANIES MUST GET A 
GRIP AND STAFF OUT MISSELLING WHICH 
IS INDEMOCRATIC AMONGST ITS SALES 
TEAMS THAT'S ENDEMIC AMONGST HIS 
SALES TEAM 
NPOWER SALES AGENTS WERE OUT ON THE 
STREETS THIS WEEK PROMISING CHEAPER 
ENERGY BILLS THEY WERE KEEN TO 
MAKE A SALE EVEN IF IT MEANT 
GIVING CUSTOMERS A HARD SELL 
NEIL SIMPSON WHO'S CHAIRMAN OF A 
LOCAL RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION HAD 
NPOWER AGENTS TRYING TO PUSH 
THROUGH HIS DOOR WHILE HE GAVE 
THEM SHORT SHRIFT SEVERAL OF HIS 
NEIGHBOURS WERE UPSET BY THEIR 
TACTICS 
THE MANNER BEING DESCRIBED TACTICS TO ME WAS QUITE AGGRESSIVE IN YOUR 
FACE AND WOULDN'T TAKE NO FOR AN 
ANSWER EVEN FROM PEOPLE SAYING 
ADAMANTLY THEY WERE NOT INTERESTED 
BUT THEY WOULD NOT GIVE UP FOOT IN 
THE DOOR SORT OF TECHNIQUE 
AND CLOSE BODY LANGUAGE 
NPOWER HAS

GRIPS WITH THE MISSELLING OF THEIR 
AGENTS IN THE FIELD AND PUT A STOP 
TO IT

STEELY WIT AND INTELLECT SHE IS A 
FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH

IRRITATING OVERWEIGHT BINGE 
DRINKING T. V. ADDICTS WHO WERE 
OBSESSED WITH CELEBRITY LATER ON 
BREAKFAST WE WILL DISCUSS A NEW 
TOURIST GUIDE WHICH SUGGESTS THAT 
IS THE CASE WE HAVE ASKED YOU WHAT 
DO YOU THINK 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY IRRITATING 
IT SAYS HERE THAT NO COUNTRY IS AS 
INSULAR AND SELF IMPORTANT AS 
ENGLAND ENGLAND WHAT ABOUT THE FRENCH AND THE 
GERMANS GERMANS OTHER ENGLISH PEOPLE BUT WE'RE NOT 
ENGLAND IS IRRITATING BECAUSE WE'RE 
VERY ITSELF PROUD 
I THINK WE ARE OBSESSED WITH 
CELEBRITIES CELEBRITIES I THINK PEOPLE ARE ASPIRING TO BE 
THAT IS WHY THERE LOOK AT 
CELEBRITIES SOMETHING THEY WANT TO 
BE A WANT TO BE LIKE 
THERE DOES SEEM TO BE AN ABUNDANCE 
OF BRITISH CELEBRITIES HAVE WE GOT 
ANY SCOTTISH CELEBRITIES 
STRAINS WANT THAT WHEN YOU ASK 
PEOPLE WHAT THEY THINK OF THE 
ENGLISH THERE IS A PERCEPTION 
STRANGE ONE THAT AT THE ENGLISH 
IRRITATING OR IS THAT CRITICISM ONE 
FARE ARE THE ENGLISH IRRITATING 
WE WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT ON 
BREAKFAST STAY WITH US 
GOOD MORNING YOU'RE WATCHING 
BREAKFAST BREAKFAST COMING UP BEFORE NINE HUNDRED A FULL 
ROUNDUP OF ALL THE SPORT INCLUDING 
DETAILS OF THE DRAMATIC DECIDING 
MATCHES IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
FIRST A SUMMARY OF THIS MORNING'S 
MAIN NEWS 
THE FIRST UN TRUCKS HAVE BEEN 
ALLOWED INTO BURMA BUT THERE ARE 
WARNINGS THAT MORE PEOPLE COULD DIE 
UNLESS FURTHER AID IS DELIVERED 
SOON TWO LORRIES ADMITTED THIS 
MORNING WERE CARRYING TENTS TO 
PROVIDE SHELTER IN THE WAKE OF LAST 
WEEK'S CYCLONE THE WORLD FOOD 
PROGRAMME SAYS THREE OF ITS FLIGHTS 
WILL ALSO ARRIVE TODAY BUT THE 
STAFF PLANNING TO ACCOMPANY THE 
CARGOES ARE STILL WAITING FOR 
BURMESE VISAS 
THOUSANDS OF SCHOOLCHILDREN ARE 
GOING TO SUFFER IN THE NEXT FEW 
WEEKS BECAUSE OF WHAT TEACHING 
UNIONS ARE CALLING EXAM CONGESTION 
SOME PUPILS WILL HAVE TO SPEND UP 
TO SEVEN HOURS SITTING THREE OR 
FOUR EXAMS IN A SINGLE DAY THE 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HEAD 
TEACHERS HAS TOLD BREAKFAST THE 
PILE UP IS GETTING WORSE AND IT 
COULD AFFECT PUPILS' RESULTS CHRIS 
HOWARD IS THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HEAD 
TEACHERS AND JOINS US NOW FROM 
CARDIFF GOOD MORNING DO YOU SHARE 
THESE CONCERNS GOING INTO THIS VERY 
VERY IMPORTANT WEEK THIS IMPORTANT 
PERIOD OF TIME 
WELL IT'S MORE 
THAN A COUPLE OF WEEKS IT'S FIVE 
SIX MAYBE EVEN SEVEN WEEKS THAT'S 
PART OF THE PROBLEM THE EXTENDED 
EXAM PERIOD BUT THERE ARE FOR 
YOUNGSTERS EXAM AFTER EXAM AFTER 
EXAM IN YEAR AFTER YEAR WE NEED 
I THINK TO REVIEW WHETHER WE ARE 
DOING ENOUGH TO EASE THE PRESSURE 
ON THEM AT THE TIME THEY'RE LEAST 
CAPABLE OF DEALING WITH IT WE'VE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE GETTING IN 
TOUCH WITH US PEOPLE WHOSE 
CHILDREN WRITING ABOUT THEIR 
CHILDREN'S CIRCUMSTANCES ONE MY 
DAUGHTER HAS FIVE AS EXAMS ON THIRD 
JUNE THE PRESSURE IS FAR TOO GREAT 
TWO DIFFERENT EXAM BOARDS NOT CO 
ORDINATING THEIR TIME TABLES ON 
THE FACE OF IT FIVE EXAMS IN ONE 
DAY THAT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO 
BE GOING ABOUT THE EDUCATION OF 
TESTING PEOPLE IS IT 
WELL IT'S 
NOT QUITE HOW WE'VE GOT HERE I 
DON'T KNOW L. THINK MOST COLLEAGUES 
WOULD SAY THAT HOWEVER WE'VE GOT 
HERE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT 
MAKING IT EASIER WHETHER THAT IS 
CUTTING THE NUMBER OF EXAM BOARDS 
TO AVOID THE CONFUSION WHETHER 
IT'S THE EXAM BOARDS NEED TO WORK 
MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER TO BETTER CO 
ORDINATE THEIR ACTIVITIES OR 
WHETHER IT'S BY SIMPLY CUTTING THE 
NUMBER OF EXAMS IS I THINK 
SOMETHING WE NEED TO DISCUSS WITH 
GOVERNMENT WITH THE BOARDS AND AS 
A PROFESSION BUT CLEARLY THE STATE 
WE'VE REACHED NOW CAN'T GO ON FOR 
MUCH LONGER I THINK IT'S 
UNACCEPTABLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IT'S IT'S UNACCEPTABLE NOW WE'RE DEALING 
WITH THE ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S 
IMMEDIATE RIGHT NOW WHY HAS IT 
BEEN ALLOWED TO GET TO THIS POINT 
HOW IS IT THE HEAD TEACHERS HAVEN'T 
BANGED HEADS WITH THE EDUCATION 
DEPARTMENT AND SAID THERE'S A 
GROWING PROBLEM HERE S. N. L. WHY ARE WE 
TALKING ABOUT IT NOW 
IN PART IT'S 
THE LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES 
WE'VE ALL WITHIN THE EDUCATION 
PROFESSION TRIED TO BROADEN THE 
CHOICE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT MEANS 
THERE WILL BE MORE EXAMS WE'VE 
TRIED TO BROADEN THE LEVELS AT 
WHICH YOUNG PEOPLE CAN GET 
QUALIFICATIONS IN ORDER TO GET MORE 
ROUTES TO SUCCESS BUT THE SUM 
TOTAL OF ALL THAT IS THAT WE'RE 
TRYING NOW TO SQUEEZE TOO MUCH INTO 
TOO SMALL A WINDOW IN MID SUMMER 
IF WE ARE TO IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT 
MORE STAGED COMPASSION AND TESTING 
RATHER THAN SINGLE PERIOD HIGH 
STAKES TEST AT THE END OF THE 
EXAMINATION PERHAPS WE COULD GET A 
BIT FURTHER L. L. THINK IT'S NOT THAT 
THE PROBLEM IS UNKNOWN THE PROBLEM 
HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR SEVERAL YEARS 
BUT OTHER THINGS HAVE GOT IN THE 
WAY I THINK IT'S TIME TO PUT YOUNG 
PEOPLE FIRST AND BEFORE THE 
INTERESTS OF OTHER PARTIES INVOLVED 
WOULD YOU TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO 
SEND A VERY CLEAR MESSAGE TO 
GOVERNMENT MINISTERS WHO ARE 
LOOKING AT THIS AS TO WHAT YOU WANT 
THEM TO DO NOW 
WELL THERE IS TOO 
MUCH TESTING YOUNG PEOPLE ARE 
FACING TOO MUCH TESTING TOO MUCH 
PRESSURE BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND EIGHTEEN IT'S 
XM AFTER EXAM AFTER EXAM AND OF 
COURSE BEFORE THAT THERE ARE EXAMS 
THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE U. K. ARE THE 
MOST EXAMINED AND TESTED IN EUROPE 
I THINK A REVIEW OF THE WHOLE THING 
IS NEEDED AND OUT OF THAT WILL COME 
A SIMPLEIFICATION PROBABLY OF THE 
EXAMS EXAMS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY

WEDDING ANNIVERSARY HAVE LOVELY 
DAY THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED 
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR RUBY 
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY THE A HAVE 
YOU GOT AN APPROPRIATE PRESENT 
YES I HAVE WHEN GETTING SOMETHING 
ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT YOU CAN GET IN 
TOUCH IN ALL THE USUAL WAYS IT IS 
ILLEGAL TO SELL ALCOHOL TO A 
ANYBODY UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN BUT 
ONLINE THERE ARE NO LAWS FORCING 
INTERNET DEALERS NEXT WEEK M. P.'S 
WILL DISCUSS A MOTION WHICH WILL 
CORRECT THAT ANOMALY COULD IT BE 
MADE TO WORK JAWLINE AND HAS MORE 
ALEXANDER IS SIXTEEN AND LIKE MANY YOUNG 
PEOPLE IS AN AVID USER OF THE 
INTERNET CHELL LYNAM 
THEY BUY D. V. D. S. BOOKS ALCOHOL 
KNIVES GUNS EVEN ONE OF MY 
FRIENDS BOUGHT SOME ALCOHOL ONLINE 
IT WAS VERY EASY TO BUY IT BECAUSE 
THEY DID NOT CHECK HIS AGE HE JUST 
PUT THE DETAILS FROM THE CARD ON TO 
THE COMPUTER AND PORTED IN A SECOND 
CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO MANDATORY 
LAWS REGARDING AGE FOR A VACATION 
BETTING FIRMS ARE REQUIRED TO CHECK 
SOMEONE IS OLD ENOUGH TO GAMBLE ON 
LINE THEY INCREASINGLY USING THE 
LATEST SOFTWARE HOW DOES THIS 
SYSTEM WORK IF I WANT TO REGISTER 
WITH A GAMBLING WEBSITE I ENTER 
SOME PERSONAL DETAILS ONLINE THAT 
IS CHECKED AGAINST PUBLICLY HELD 
DATA SUCH AS THE BIRTH REGISTRY 
THE HOME OFFICE OR LOCAL AUTHORITY 
THAT CAN TELL ME INSTANTANEOUSLY 
WHETHER I AM OVER EIGHTEEN OR NOT THIS 
FRIDAY THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WILL 
DISCUSS THE NEXT STAGE OF PRIVATE 
BILL REGARDING AGE VERIFICATION 
THAT SHOULD BE GOOD NEWS FOR 
PARENTS AND FOR PEOPLE LIKE THE G. B. 
GROUP WHICH SELLS EIGHTY PER CENT OF ALL AGE 
FOR APPLICATION SOFTWARE GAMBLING 
WEBSITE THE TAKE UP HAS BEEN SLOW 
BUT THE REST OF BRITAIN'S ONLINE 
RETAILERS RETAILERS THE FIRST RETAILERS TO EMBRACE THIS 
TECHNOLOGY WILL SEE A SLIGHT 
INCREASE IN THE TIME IT TAKES TO 
COMPLETE A TRANSACTION UNLESS 
THESE CHECKS ARE MADE OBLIGATORY I 
THINK PARENTS WILL STILL CONTINUE 
TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT THEIR KIDS CAN 
BUY ONLINE 
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THERE ANY 
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF INSTANCES OF 
YOUNGSTERS BUYING AGE RESTRICTED 
PRODUCTS ONLINE NO RESPONSIBLE 
RETAILER WOULD HAVE ANY INTEREST AT 
ALL IN SELLING THOSE SORTS OF 
THINGS TO YOUNGSTERS THERE ARE 
NUMBER OF PROTECTIONS IN PLACE FOR 
EXAMPLE WEBSITES USUALLY NEEDED TO 
REGISTER IF YOU BUY SOMETHING LIKE 
ALCOHOL THE RETAILER WILL ACTUALLY 
ON THE DEAL WITH THE YOU FACE TO 
FACE FACE AND THERE IS THE ISSUE OF THE DATA 
PROTECTION THAT PROTECTION

MORNING MORNING FIRST THOUGH OUR MAIN NEWS THIS 
MORNING THE FIRST TWO UNITED 
NATIONS AID TRUCKS HAVE BEEN GIVEN 
PERMISSION TO GO INTO BURMA THEY 
CROSSED THE THAI BORDER CARRYING 
TENTS WHICH WILL PROVIDE SHELTER IN 
THE WAKE OF LAST WEEK'S SIGH 
COLONIAL BUT THERE ARE WARNINGS 
THIS MORNING THAT MORE PEOPLE WILL 
DIE UNLESS THERE'S BIG INCREASE 
IN AID SUPPLIES THERE ARE REPORTS 
OF FURTHER DELAYS IN ALLOWING 
FOREIGN RELIEF WORKERS INTO THE 
COUNTRY MANY ARE STILL WAITING FOR 
VISAS VISAS A WEEK AFTER THE DEVASTATING 
CYCLONE THE FIRST UN AID TRUCKS 
FINALLY CROSS THE BORDER INTO BURMA 
A SIGN PERHAPS THAT GROWING 
INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE ON THE 
MILITARY GOVERNMENT IS TAKING 
EFFECT WITH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS 
OF PEOPLE NOW AT RISK OF HUNGER AND 
DISEASE THE AID IS DESPERATELY 
NEEDED NEEDED THREE MORE FLIGHTS CONTAINING FOOD 
MEDICINE AND OTHER SUPPLIES ARE 
ALSO DUE TO ARRIVE IN THE COUNTRY 
TODAY BUT THERE'S NO SIGN OF 
BREAKTHROUGH OVER FOREIGN AID 
WORKERS ENTERING THE COUNTRY 
APPLYING FOR VISAS REREMAINS A SLOW 
PROCESS THE EMBASSY IN THAILAND 
HAS CLOSED FOR A PUBLIC HOLIDAY I I APPLIED FOR SIXTEEN SO FAR IN THE 
IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE CYCLONE 
AND SO FAR ONLY ONE HAS BEEN 
GRANTED IT'S INCREDIBLY 
FRUSTRATING WO WORKING REMOTE 
CONTROL FROM THE COUNTRY NEXT DOOR 
IS DOABLE BUT PUTTING ENORMOUS 
STRAEN ON OUR STAFF ALREADY IN THE 
FIELD 
IN THE MEANTIME THE PEOPLE FIELD OF BOGALAY AND IRRAWADDY DELTA DO 
WHATEVER THEY CAN TO SURVIVE THIS 
LOW LYING REGION BORE THE BRUNT OF 
THE CYCLONE AND THE TIDAL WAVES 
THAT FOLLOWED IT SHOULD BE THE 
FOCUS OF ANY AID RELIEF BUT HAS 
RECEIVED VERY LITTLE BURMA IS 
ALLOWING MORE AID INTO THE COUNTRY 
BUT THE LEADERS SAY THEY AND NOT 
FOREIGN AID AGENCIES L. DISTRIBUTE 
SUPPLIES THIS CAREFULLY STAGE 
MANAGED PHOTO CALL ON STATE RUN T. V. 
IS TRYING TO SHOW A GOVERNMENT 
FIRMLY IN CONTROL EXPERTS SAY THE 
SCALE OF THE DISASTER IS SIMPLY TOO 
VAST TO BE HANDLED ALONE BUT 
MILITARY LEADERS ARE TRYING TO SEND 
A MESSAGE OF BUSINESS AS USUAL A 
REFERENDUM ON THE COUNTRY'S FUTURE 
PLANNED FOR THIS WEEKEND HAS GONE 
AHEAD DESPITE WORLDWIDE CALLS TO 
POSTPONE THE VOTE PRO DEMOCRACY 
VOTES HAVE ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT 
OF CONCENTRATING ON WHAT IT CALLS A 
SHAM CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM 
INSTEAD OF SAVING LIVES 
THE UN BELIEVES AS MANY AS A 
MILLION AND A HALF PEOPLE COULD 
HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE CYCLONE 
IT'S NOW WARNING THE LIVES OF THOSE 
SURVIVORS COULD BE AT RISK UNLESS 
MORE AID REACHES THEM SOON 
MORE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE 
BURMA LATER 
THE PRESSURE IS ON FOR THOUSANDS OF 
SCHOOLCHILDREN AS THE EXAM SEASON 
IS UPON US IT'S A DIFFICULT TIME 
BUT TEACHING UNIONS SAY IT'S BEEN 
MADE WORSE BY WHAT THEY CALL EXAM 
CONGESTION SOME PUPILS WILL HAVE 
TO SPEND UP TO SEVEN HOURS SITTING 
THREE OR FOUR EXAMS IN A SINGLE DAY 
THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HEAD 
TEACHERS HAS TOLD BREAKFAST THE 
PILE UP IS GETTING WORSE AND IT 
COULD AFFECT PUPILS' RESULTS WITH 
THE MAIN EXAM SEASON STARTING ON 
MONDAY STRESS LEVELS IN SCHOOLS 
ARE RATCHETING UP BUT THIS YEAR 
IT'S BEEN MADE WORSE ACCORDING TO 
TEACHING UNIONS BY EXAM CONGESTION 
WHEN PUPILS HAVE EXAMS CRAMMED 
TOGETHER AND IN MANY CASES EVEN 
CLASHING CLASHING STUDENTS ARE NOW STUDYING MORE 
SUBJECTS THAT MEANS MORE EXAMS 
MORE LEVELS AND MORE MODULES AT 
THE HEIGHT OF THE EXAM SEASON 
STUDENTS CAN BE SITTING IN 
EXAMINATIONS FOR AS MUCH AS SEVEN 
HOURS A DAY THESE A LEVEL STUDENTS 
ARE EXAMS SO TIGHTLY PACKED THEY 
BELIEVE THEIR RESULTS WILL BE 
AFFECTED 
I'VE GOT WEDNESDAY AFFECTED THURSDAY AND FRIDAY NINE EXAMS 
WITH WITHIN THOSE THREE DAYS YOU YOU FEEL BY THE TIME YOU'VE GOT TO YOUR 
LAST SUBJECT YOU'RE PUTTING IN LESS 
EFFORT THAN YOU WAS AT THE 
BEGINNING WHEN YOU GOT AT NINE HUNDRED 
BECAUSE IT'S THREE HUNDRED IN THE AFTERNOON 
AND YOU'RE STILL SITTING IN EXAM 
CONDITIONS SO IT DEFINITELY 
AFFECTS THE FINAL GRADE YOU GET 
PUPILS WHO HAVE MORE OF A TIMETABLE 
SPREAD OUT HAVE MORE OF AN 
ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY GET MORE 
TIME TO REVISE FOR EACH SUBJECT AND 
THE PRESSURE IS NOT ON BECAUSE THEY 
DON'T HAVE ALL THOSE EXAMS CRAMMED 
INTO ONE DAY 
THE PROBLEMS WE'RE 
FINDING IS THAT WE'RE GETTING A 
BUFRPBLING OF EXAMS IF ONE DAY SO 
PUPILS CAN BE SITTING THREE EXAMS 
IN ONE DAY THAT MEANS THEY'RE 
MENTALLY EXHAUSTED BY THE LAST EXAM 
TEACHING UNIONS SAY THE LOG JAM OF 
EXAMS IS GETTING WORSE WHICH IS 
CAUSING UNACCEPTABLE STRESS LEVELS 
IN PUPILS 
THE EXAM BOARDS NEED TO DO EVEN 
MORE TO BEST CO ORDINATE THEIR 
EFFORTS SO YOUNGSTERS DON'T HAVE 
THIS PROBLEM OF THREE AND FOUR 
EXAMINATIONS ON ONE DAY WHICH IS 
CLEARLY ASKING TOO MUCH OF ANYBODY 
IT CAN'T ENCOURAGE THE BEST 
PERFORMANCE BY THEM 
THE JOINT 
COUNCIL FOR QUALIFICATIONS 
REPRESENTS THE EXAM BODIES IT SAYS 
IT HAS A DIFFICULT JOB TRYING TO 
CRAM AROUND THREE THOUSAND EXAM PAPERS INTO 
THIRTY DAYS OF 
COMPASSIONS THEY SAY 
THEY TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE 
AFFECT BACK TO BACK EXAMS CAN HAVE 
ON CANDIDATES 
THE EXAM LOG JAM IS LIKELY TO GET 
EVEN WORSE NEXT YEAR AS NEW AND OLD 
A LEVEL SYSTEMS OVERLAP WITH A 
LEVEL RESULTS NEEDED IN TIME FOR 
UNIVERSITY ALLOCATIONS THERE'S NO 
SCOPE TO EXTEND THE EXAM PERIOD 
EXAM CONGESTION AND STRESS LEVELS 
IN MAY AND JUNE WILL CONTINUE TO 
RISE RISE THE SELLING TACTICS OF ONE OF 
BRITAIN'S BIGGEST ENERGY COMPANIES 
HAVE BEEN STRONGLY CRITICISED BY 
THE INDUSTRY WATCHDOG ENERGY WATCH 
SAY NPOWER MUST STAMP OUT THE 
WIDESPREAD MISSELLING BY ITS DOOR 
TO DOOR SALES TEAM THE COMPANY HAS 
DISMISSED A HANDFUL OF AGENTS AFTER 
A NEWSPAPER INVESTIGATION BUT 
BREAKFAST HAS DISCOVERED THOSE ARE 
NOT ISOLATED INCIDENTS 
TONY BLAIR IS ADVISING GORDON BROWN 
ON HOW TO WIN THE NEXT ELECTION 
THAT'S ACCORDING TO CHERIE BLAIR 
WHOSE AUTO BIOGRAPHY IS BEING 
SERIALISED IN THE TIMES AND THE SUN 
NEWSPAPERS FROM TODAY SHE ALSO 
SUGGESTS MR. BROWN WAS RATTLING THE 
KEYS TO DOWNING STREET IN THE HOPE 
OF GETTING THE FORMER PRIME 
MINISTER OUT OF OFFICE BEFORE THE 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE ELECTION 
SHE'S NEVER BEEN AFRAID TO SPEAK 
HER MIND 
I DON'T THINK WE'LL MISS YOU NOW NOW CHERIE BLAIR AS REVEALED THE LOVE 
HATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HER 
HUSBAND AND THE MAN WHO USED TO 
LIVE NEXT DOOR GORDON BROWN 
IN AN INTERVIEW IN TODAY'S TIMES 
MRS. BLAIR DISCLOSES THAT TONY BLAIR 
IS IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH THE 
PRIME MINISTER AND IS GIVING HIM 
ADVICE ON HOW TO WIN THE NEXT 
ELECTION ELECTION SAYING 
HOWEVER SHE ALSO CLAIMS THAT HER 
HUSBAND MIGHT HAVE STOOD DOWN IN 
TWO THOUSAND FIVE BUT FOR THE FACT THAT HE FELT 
GORDON BROWN WAS TRYING TO PUSH HIM 
OUT OF OFFICE 
MRS. BLAIR HAS CHOSEN TO GIVE HER 
ACCOUNT OF THE BLAIR BROWN YEARS 
NOW BECAUSE HER AUTO BIOGRAPHY 
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF IS BEING 
PUBLISHED NEXT WEEK HER ANTIPATHY 
TOWARDS GORDON BROWN HAS BEEN ONE 
OF WESTMINSTER'S WORST KEPT 
SECRETS AND SOMETHING OF A STANDING 
JOKE JOKE AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY 
ABOUT HER RUNNING OFF WITH THE 
BLOKE NEXT DOOR 
BUT LAST NIGHT CHERIE BLAIR'S 
PUBLISHERS INSISTED THE DECISION TO 
BRING THE PUBLICATION FORWARD 
WASN'T AN ATTEMPT TO ADD TO GORDON 
BROWN'S CURRENT WOES THEY SAID IT 
HAPPENED BECAUSE THE BOOK WAS 
FINISHED EARLY LAST NIGHT DOWNING 
STREET SAID IT WOULDN'T BE 
COMMENTING ON THE BOOK BUT 
CONFIRMED THE TWO MEN DO TALK 
REGULARLY 
AROUND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY PASSENGERS WERE FORCED 
TO STAY ON A TRAIN IN ONTARIO IN 
CANADA EVER A FEMALE PASSENGER DIED 
AND SEVERAL PEOPLE FELL ILL WITH 
FLU LIKE PASSENGERS THE TRAIN WAS 
QUARANTINED BUT HEALTH OFFICIALS 
SAID THERE WAS NO OUTBREAK OF 
INFECTIOUS DISEASES 
SEVERAL HUNDRED COUPLES WITH A 
COMBINED TOTAL OF OVER FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND YEARS 
OF MARRIAGE WILL BE CELEBRATING 
THEIR ANNIVERSARIES AT A SPECIAL 
MASS IN WESTMINSTER CATHEDRAL TODAY 
THE ARCHBISHOP OF THE DIOCESE 
CARDINAL CORMAC MURPHY O'CONNOR 
INVITED HUSBANDS AND WIVES MARKING 
SPECIAL WEDDING ANNIVERSARY S. TO 
ATTEND ANNIVERSARIES TO ATTEND 
TWENTY NINE OF THEM HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR 
MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS 
BACK TO THE MAIN STORY THIS MORNING 
FEARS THAT MANY MORE PEOPLE IN 
BURMA COULD LOSE THEIR LIVES UNLESS 
FOREIGN RELIEF WORKERS ARE ALLOWED 
INTO THE COUNTRY BY THE BURMA 
GOVERNMENT THE BRITISH DEVELOPMENT 
MINISTER GARETH THOMAS IS IN OUR 
WESTMINSTER STUDIO GOOD MORNING MR. 
THOMAS 
GOOD MORNING 
WHAT DO YOU THOMAS MAKE OF THE CURRENT SITUATION 
WE'VE SEEN THIS MORNING TWO UN AID 
TRUCKS GOING IN BUT WE UNDERSTAND 
THERE ARE STILL RESTRICTIONS ON THE 
AID WORKERS WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO GO 
IN WITH THEM TO DISTRIBUTE THAT AID 
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE HAS BEEN SOME 
POSITIVE MOVEMENT IN TERMS OF SOME 
FLIGHTS GETTING IN FOR EXAMPLE WE 
KNOW THAT THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME 
HAVE RESUMED THEIR FLIGHTS WE KNOW 
THAT SOME AID AGENCIES SOME N. G. O. S. 
ARE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE RELIEF ITEMS 
SUCH AS FOOD AND SHELTER INDEED A 
BRITISH HUMANITARIAN ASSESSMENT 
TEAM IS LEAVING TODAY WITH VISAS 
TO GO TO RANGOON THAT IS POSITIVE 
HOWEVER WE ARE STILL HEARING A 
CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF REPORTS OF 
DIFFICULTIES OF GETTING VISAS AND 
THAT REMAINS A SUBSTANTIAL CONCERN 
IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT THE BURMESE 
AUTHORITIES DO NOT HAVE THE 
CAPACITY THEMSELVES TO PROVIDE THE 
LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO 
THEIR PEOPLE THAT IS NECESSARY IS IS IT CLEAR TO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY 
SORT OF COMMUNICATION OR ANY 
CLEARER PICTURE OF PRECISELY WHY 
THE BURMESE AUTHORITIES ARE PUTTING 
UP THESE OBSTACLES 
THE BLUNT 
ANSWER TO THAT IS NO WE HAVE HEARD 
IN NEW YORK YESTERDAY THAT THE 
BURMESE AUTHORITIES ARE WELCOMING 
OFFERS OF ASSISTANCE AND IT'S 
CERTAINLY TRUE THAT SOME 
INTERNATIONAL AID HAS BEEN ACCEPTED 
BY THE BURMESE BUT IT'S ALSO 
EQUALLY TRUE THAT MORE OFFERS OF 
INTERNATIONAL AID HAVE BEEN TURBD 
TURNED AWAY BY THE BURMESE 
AUTHORITIES GIVEN THE SCALE OF THE 
DISASTER AND THE NUMBERS WHO HAVE 
BEEN AFFECTED AND THE CONCERN THAT 
IF ASSISTANCE ISN'T GOT TO THOSE 
WHO ARE STILL ALIVE AND SOON THEN 
THE RISK OF FURTHER DISEASE 
BREAKING OUT AND FURTHER LOSS OF 
LIFE IS CONSIDERABLE 
WITHOUT CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF 
WHY EXACTLY IT IS THAT THEY'RE 
BEING RESISTANT IT MUST BE HARD 
FOR YOU TO KNOW HOW TO PUT PRESSURE 
ON THEM TO OPEN UP 
WE'RE PUTTING 
PRESSURE THROUGH A VARIETY OF WAYS 
WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS ON 
THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL OUR 
AMBASSADOR IN TO THE UNITED 
NATIONS WAS BEAT MEETING WITH THE 
BURMESE YESTERDAY THE FOREIGN 
SECRETARY AND THE SECRETARY OF 
STATE FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
HAVE BEEN LIAISING WITH THEIR 
COUNTERPARTS ACROSS THE REGION 
IT'S CLEAR IF BETTER ACCESS IS 
GOING TO BE ACHIEVED INTO THE 
AFFECTED AREAS IT NEEDS THE 
NEIGHBOURS OF BURMA TO HELP DELIVER 
THAT BETTER ACCESS 
SOME CALLS FOR 
AN AID DROP TO OVERCOME THOSE 
OBSTACLES IS THAT SOMETHING YOU 
MIGHT BE CONSIDERING 
WE'RE NOT 
CONSIDERING AN AIR DROP AT THE 
MOMENT BLUNTLY AN AIR DROP IS 
OFTEN NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS PEOPLE 
MIGHT THINK PARTICULARLY GIVEN HOW 
MUCH DAMAGE THERE HAS BEEN IN THE 
AREA AND GEFPB THE SHORTAGE OF AID 
WORKERS ON THE GROUND TO RECEIVE 
AID THAT IS DROPPED IN A NUMBER OF 
N. G. O. S. WHO ARE ON THE GROUND ARE 
REPAIRING BOATS FOR EXAMPLE TO 
GET BETTER ACCESS BUT WE WILL NEED 
TO SEE SUBSTANTIAL AIR CAPABILITY 
FOR EXAMPLE HELICOPTERS ET CETERA 
TO AIRLIFT SUPPLIES IN UNLESS WE 
CAN GET BETTER ACCESS FOR 
HUMANITARIAN AID WORKERS THE TYPE 
OF ASSISTANCE THAT'S NECESSARY 
FRANKLY DOESN'T LOOK AS THOUGH 
IT'S GOING TO GET THROUGH ON TIME 
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN AT 
THIS STAGE TO URGE THE BURMESE 
AUTHORITIES TO STEP UP THE OPENING 
UP OF THEIR COUNTRY 
THIS TIME OF YEAR HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
HARD FOR STUDENTS IT SEEMS AS 
THOUGH EXAM SEASON STARTS JUST AS 
THE SUN COMES OUT BUT THEY'RE 
HAVING TO WORK HARDER THAN EVER 
FRBGS WITH SOME SCHOOL PUPILS 
HAVING TO SIT UP TO FOUR EXAMS 
MARY BOUSTED IS FROM THE NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION OF HEAD TEACHERS 
LECTURERS 
EVERYONE SEEMS TO AGREE THERE IS A 
MADNESS ABOUT THIS 
THERE IS IT'S 
A MADNESS WE IN ENGLAND PUT OUR 
CHILDREN THROUGH THIRTEEN MILLION EXAMS A 
YEAR IF YOU INCLUDE THE NATIONAL 
CURRICULUM TESTS AND THE OTHERS 
IT COSTS THE EDUCATION SEVERAL 
HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS THAT'S FOUR HUNDRED 
MILLION PAID TO THE EXAM BOARDS IN 
FEES AND MONEY TO ADMINISTER THE 
EXAMS WE'RE LOSING VAST AMOUNTS OF 
MONEY AND PUTTING OUR CHILDREN 
THROUGH RELENTLESS TEST MEAL IF IF ALL THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN TEACHING 
UNIONS TEACHERS THEMSELVES AND THE 
PUPILS ARE SAYING THEY CAN'T HANDLE 
IT IT'S TOO MUCH WHO IS SAYING 
IT'S A GOOD WAY FOR EXAMS TO BE 
DONE 
IT SEEMS TO BE THE DONE GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO THINK THAT THE 
ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN TELL HOW WELL 
SOMEONE IS DOING IS PUT THEM 
THROUGH AN EXAM WE'VE DEVELOPED A 
SYSTEM WHICH CONTINUALLY AND 
REPEATEDLY TESTS CHILDREN AT SEVEN 
ELEVEN FOURTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THEN YOU GET 
TESTS THAT SCHOOLS DO AS WELL TO 
SEE HOW SCHOOLCHILDREN ARE DOING 
YOU GET THIS RELENTLESS EXAMINATION 
AND TESTING TREADMILL 
WE'RE THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD 
WHO DOES THIS NO OTHER COUNTRY 
YOU END UP WITH EXTRAORDINARY 
SITUATIONS WE HAVE TWO EXAMS THIS 
MORNING I HAVE SEVEN HOURS OF 
EXAMS ON FRIDAY THIRTEENTH JUNE DUE TO 
EXTRA TIME HAVING TO SIT ONE ON 
SATURDAY MORNING THAT MEANS 
TEACHERS' SUPERVISION OVERNIGHT 
ANOTHER ONE MY YOUNGER BROTHER IS 
IN HIS FIRST YEAR OF A LEVELS 
SCHEDULED TO TAKE SIX EXAMS ON 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON SCHOOL CAN'T DO 
ANYTHING ABOUT IT THE RESULT IS 
THAT HE HAS TO BE KEPT IN ISOLATION 
FOR THE WEEKEND AWAY FROM FAMILY 
AND FRIENDS 
ABSOLUTELY IF YOU THINK WHAT THAT 
PRESSURE AND THAT AMOUNT OF TESTING 
IN EXAMS WILL DO TO THOSE PUPILS 
RESULTS BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY KNOW 
THAT ANY MORE THAN TWO EXAMS IN ONE 
DAY IS TOO MUCH YOU GET VERY TIRED 
YOU ARE REQUIRED TO REMEMBER VAST 
AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION THAT IS NOT 
A SYSTEM WHERE YOU WILL GET YOU 
JUST DESERTS 
IS THIS PROBLEM OF THE KNOCK ON 
AND NOT EVEN SURE HOW THESE 
MECHANICS WORK HOW DOES IT WORK 
AND EXAMS ARE CLASS THING SO MUCH 
THEY HAVE TO BE HELD OVER 
IT CAN HAPPEN IN A VARIETY OF WAYS 
THE SCHOOL HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT 
THE CANDIDATE DOES NOT GET UNFAIR 
ADVANTAGE FOR EXAMPLE BY TALKING 
TO SOMEONE WHO HAS SAT THE EXAM 
EXAMINATION CENTRE HAS TO ENSURE 
THEIR ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE OF THAT 
CANDIDATE IS NOT DISADVANTAGED OF 
THESE CANDIDATES HER SANE IS THERE 
ARE DISADVANTAGED THEY HAVE TO DO 
FAR TOO MANY EXAMS TO QUICKLY 
DOES THIS MEAN THEY GO TO HOTEL 
FOR A NIGHT 
THE SCHOOL USUALLY ARRANGES FOR 
THEM TO STAY WITH A MEMBER OF STAFF 
IT IS NOT USUALLY A HOTEL BUT IT IS 
A SAFE PLACE WHERE THEY CANNOT GET 
ACCESS TO ANYBODY ELSE WHO HAS SAT 
THE EXAM 
THE EFFECT ON THIS EFFECT OF THIS 
IS THAT THE EMPHASIS ON EXAM 
RESULTS ARE BUZZ IF YOU ARE DOING 
EXAMS THERE IS A HUGE PRESSURE ON 
THE SYSTEM 
THERE IS A HUGE PRESSURE ON 
CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE WE KNOW 
THAT CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE ARE 
SHOWING GREATER LEVELS OF STRESS 
SOME OF THEM ARE BECOMING ILL 
WE HAVE HAD QUITE FEW PEOPLE 
GETTING IN TOUCH SAYING WE ALL 
TOOK EXAMS THIS ONE FROM DANIELLE 
SAYS IF STUDENTS STARTED REVISING 
A FEW MONTHS IN ADVANCE THE TIMING 
OF THE EXAMS WOULD NOT MATTER DO 
YOU HAVE ANY SYMPATHY WERE THAT 
YES IT HAS GOT DRAMATICALLY WORSE 
IT ABSOLUTELY HAS WE REALLY DO 
NEED TO HAVE GENUINE SYMPATHY FOR 
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE BEING TESTED 
TO DESTRUCTION 
THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR E. MAILS ON 
THAT AS WELL THE HEADLINES ON B. B. C. 
NEWS TWENTY FOUR THE FIRST TO UN AID TRUCKS

THE WAY THAT NPOWER HAVE ALLOWED 
THEIR SALES STAFF TO TERRORISE 
CONSUMERS CONSUMERS ENDEMIC IS AN INTERESTING WORD DO 
YOU MEAN WHAT APPEARS TO BE 
HAPPENING IS THAT THEIR CULTURE 
THE CULTURE OF SALES THERE ARE

JACKSON AND BARNEY STOREY 
LEWIS HAMILTON WAS SATISFIED WITH 
HIS TIMES AROUND THE ISTANBUL GRAND 
PRIX AHEAD OF TODAY'S OFFICIAL 
QUALIFYING AT LUNCH TIME HE WAS 
FOURTH IN THE OVERALL SESSIONS BUT 
THINKS A FEW SUBTLE CHANGES TO THE 
SET UP CAN HELP HIM COMPETE WITH 
THE FERRARIS FELIPE MASSA IS GOING 
FOR A HAT TRICK OF WINS IN TURKEY 
AND SET THE FASTEST TIME OF THE DAY 
IN THE MORNING SESSIONS THE TIMES 
WERE AL LITTLE SLOWER IN THE 
AFTERNOON BUT KIMI RAIKKONEN WAS 
QUICKEST IT STARTS A BUSY WEEK ALL 
ROUND IN MOTOR SPORT 
NEXT WEEKEND IT'S THE SECOND ROUND 
OF THE EUROPEAN DRIFT CHAMPIONSHIP 
IN SCOTLAND IF YOU EVER SPOT 
RACING CAR SKIDING ALONG THE TARMAC 
WHEELS SCREECHING AND SIDEWAYS ON 
YOU'D THINK IT WAS IN TROUBLE BUT 
NOT IN DRIFTING 
A BURNING DESIRE TO BE DIFFERENT 
IN ANY OTHER KIND OF MOTOR SPORT IF 
YOU SKID IN YOUR CAR LIKE THAT AT 
ONE HUNDRED M. P. H. YOU WOULD HAVE OBVIOUSLY 
MADE A MISTAKE OR MISJUDGED A 
CORNER BUT IT'S THE WHOLE POINT IN 
DRIFTING AND IT'S WHY IT'S WHY 
THEY KEPT THROUGH A SET OF TYRES 
EVERY FIVE MINUTES 
IT STARTED IN JAPAN IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
IN THE LAST DECADE IT'S GONE 
WORLDWIDE WITH EUROPEAN AND BRITISH 
CHAMPIONSHIP EVENTS NOW HELD HERE 
THAT'S IT UP WITH THE CLUTCH 
THAT'S IT 
I WAS GIVEN MY FIRST SPIN BY THE 
REINING EUROPEAN REIGNING 
EUROPEAN CHAMPION 
YOU'RE DRIFTING WHEN YOUR FRONT 
WHEELS ARE POINTING ONE WAY AND THE 
CAR IS TURNING THE OTHER IT'S IT'S DIFFERENT FROM EVERYTHING ELSE 
YOU'VE LEARNT FROM WHEN YOU START 
TO DRIVE YOU BUILD UP THE SPEED 
AND THEN YOU KIND OF THROW THE CAR 
INTO A SIDE WARDS MOTION AND LET 
THE CAR SLIDE WHERE IT WANTS TO GO 
FOR BEGINNERS THIS IS SUCH 
STRANGE CONCEPT TO LEARN 
REALLY GO FOR IT YOU WON'T DO ANY 
DAMAGE CLUTCH OFF MORE REVS 
IN THIS WEEKS' EUROPEAN 
CHAMPIONSHIP ROUND NEAR EDINBURGH 
DRIVERS WILL BE JUDGED ON SPEED 
THE ANGLE THEY TAKE AND HOW 
SPECTACULAR THEIR DRIFT LOOKS THE 
MORE SMOKE THE BETTER 
THIS IS 
REAL LIFE VIDEO GAME L. GUESS 
THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT 
SIDE TO SIDE ACTION ONE HUNDRED M. P. H. 
IT IS THE MOST INTENSE ADRENALINE 
RUSH BUT HOPES OF A HIGH SCORE CAN 
SOMETIMES COME TO AN END 
I THINK SOMETHING CAME OFF 
IT'S UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU'VE 
EXPERIENCED IN A CAR BEFORE 
WELL DONE 
SO THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP THERE 
LOEFGT THE FRONT OF HIS CAR THE 
RADIATOR WENT AND THE TYRES AGAIN 
YOU CAN SEE IT AGAIN ON THE B. B. C. 
NEWS WEBSITE JUST CLICK MIKE 
BUSHELL DID IT CHANGE YOUR DRIVING 
TECHNIQUE WHEN YOU GOT INTO YOUR 
OWN CAR 
NO I WAS VERY CAREFUL AS 
I WILL BE THIS AFTERNOON 
SO DON'T TRY THAT AT HOME IT'S A 
VERY SPECIALISED FORM OF DRIVING 
THAT'S GOOD WAY OF DESCRIBING IT 
THANKS VERY MUCH 
ENGLAND MAY BE GREEN AND PLEASANT 
LAND TO SOME BUT AS FAR AS THE 
AUTHORS OF A NEW GUIDE BOOK ARE 
CONCERNED IT'S ALSO NATION 
WAIT FOR IT BEER SWILLING 
OVERWEIGHT CELEBRITY OBSESSED T. V. 
ADDICTS IN A MINUTE WE'LL BE 
ASKING JOURNALIST SUE CARROL AND 
THE ROUGH GUIDE PUBLISHER MARK 
DUNFORD IF THE ENGLISH REALLY ARE 
THAT IRRITATING FIRST IF YOU'RE 
ENGLISH AND DON'T RECOGNISE 
YOURSELF FROM THAT DESCRIPTION 
LOOK AWAY NOW WE'VE BEEN OUT TO 
TEST THE THEORY 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY IRRITATING IT IT SAYS HERE NO COUNTRY IS AS INSULAR 
SELF IMPORTANT AND IRRITATING AS 
ENGLAND 
WHAT ABOUT 
THE FRENCH AND ENGLAND THE GERMANS 
OTHER ENGLISH PEOPLE 
ARE LIKE THAT WE'RE NOT ENGLAND ENGLAND IS IRRITATING BECAUSE WE'RE SMUG 
WE'RE VERY VERY SELF PROUD IT'S IT'S NOT THE MOST IRRITATING COUNTRY IN 
THE WORLD BUT I THINK WE ARE 
OBSESSED WITH CELEBRITIES 
I THINK PEOPLE ARE ASPIRING TO BE 
LIKE THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR LIVES 
AND NOT HAVING ENOUGH THAT'S WHY 
THEY LOOK AT CELEBRITIES IN THAT 
DIRECTION SOMETHING THEY WANT TO 
BE LIKE 
THERE DOES SEEM TO BE 
AABUNDANCE OF BRITISH CELEBRITIES 
DOESN'T THERE HAVE WE GOT ANY 
SCOTTISH CELEBRITIES 
WELL MARTIN DUNFORD IS PARTLY 
RESPONSIBLE HE'S CO FOUNDER AND 
TRAVEL PUBLISHING DIRECTOR OF THE 
ROUGH GUIDE TO ENGLAND GOOD 
MORNING AND SUE CARROL 
BROADCASTER AND JOURNALIST SITTING 
NEXT TO HIM DOES IT LEAVE YOU 
SPITING OR ARE WE IRRITATING 
INSULAR 
WE CAN BE WE DON'T LIKE INSULAR TO BE CRITICISED BY ANYBODY ELSE 
WE'RE PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF 
CRITICISING OURSELVES MUCH WHEN WE 
GET THIS MASSIVE ABUSE THROWN AT US 
WE'RE PORTRAYED AS A NATION WHO 
SHOULD BE HAVING A NERVOUS 
BREAKDOWN TESTIMONY SUGGESTED IN 
THE ROUGH GUIDE THAT WE'VE GOT 
DESPITE OUR MATERIAL POSSESSIONS 
WE'RE SWALLOWING DRUGS BY THE 
BUCKET LOAD L. L. I. E. NERVE CALMING DRUGS DRUGS ON THE BEER SWILG OVER WET 
CELEBRITY OBSESSED T. V. ADDICTS DO 
YOU THINK THAT STANDS UP 
I THINK IT DOES USUALLY HAVE TO 
OPEN THE PAPERS YOU GUYS ARE 
ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT CELEBRITY 
USUALLY HAVE TO OPEN THE PAPERS IT 
IS ONLY HALF THE STORY A LOT OF 
PEOPLE AT PIPETTE THE QUOTES ABOUT 
ENGLAND THAT WE CAME OUT WITH 
DIDN'T YOU EXPECT THEM TO ISN'T IT 
GREAT PUBLICITY FOR YOUR BOOK 
NO COUNTRY IS AS INSULAR AND 
IRRITATING IS ONE OF THE QUOTE NO 
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD 
I. M. SURE OTHERS CAN GIVE IT A RUN 
FOR ITS MONEY SOMEONE THERE 
SUGGESTED THE FRENCH WHAT WE'RE 
TRYING TO GET ACROSS IS THE 
COMPLEXITY OF ENGLAND WHAT WE'RE 
TRYING TO DO IS GET UNDER THE SKIN 
OF A PLACE AND GET A LITTLE BIT 
KEEPER DEEPER THAN OTHER GUIDES 
DO TO GET PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND 
WHAT MAKES PEOPLE TICK 
THE PEOPLE 
AND DERBY ARE NOT GOING TO BE VERY 
HAPPY YOU SAY PRACTICALLY DO NOT 
GO THERE IN NEWCASTLE THE 
LANGUAGE IS IMPENETRABLE 
DERBY IS 
QUITE INTERESTING WHAT WE SAY 
ABOUT DHABI IS IT IS AN EXCITING 
BUT THE CENTRE HAS BEEN RADICALLY 
SPRUCED UP DERBY 
HOW LONG DID 
YOU RESEARCHERS SPEND IN THESE 
PLACES PLACES THEY ALL LIVE HERE THEY SPENT 
LONG AND THERE 
WHO BUYS THE ROUGH GUIDE TO 
ENGLAND FOREIGNERS HUMOUR OF 
ANYONE WHO TRAVELS AROUND ENGLAND 
WE SELL A LOT OF BOOKS ABROAD AND 
WE SELL A LOT IN AMERICA L. WOULD 
SUGGEST THIS BOOK WILL TELL US 
PEOPLE IN ENGLAND A LOT ABOUT THE 
COUNTRY THEY DID NOT KNOW ALREADY 
DO YOU THINK AN ENGLISH COMPANY 
PROMOTING A TOURIST GUIDE TO 
ENGLAND HAS A SENSE OF 
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROMOTE THE 
COUNTRY AS OPPOSED TO JUST 
ANALYSING AND CRITICISING HE HE DINNER WANTED TO BE BORING 
OBVIOUSLY IT HAS GOT TO BE FULL 
THE BRITISH TOURIST BOARD DESCRIBED 
SOME OF THE COMMONS AS BEING A 
LITTLE BIT ON ONE CHEEK COMMENTS 
I DO NOT WANT IT TO BE TONGUE IN 
CHEEK IF I AM PAYING FIFTEEN POINT NINE NINE WHAT I 
WANT IT TO BE FACTUAL MAINLY 
YOU'RE SAYING THOSE OBSERVATIONS DO 
NOT TALLY WITH WHAT DO YOU THINK IS 
RIGHT RIGHT I DON'T WANT PEOPLE MAKING THEIR 
MINDS UP FOR ME THAT IS THE POINT 
OF TRAVELLING 
BECAUSE YOU'RE WRITING ABOUT THE 
COUNTRY WERE YOUR RESEARCHERS MAY 
HAVE AND ARE PROBABLY FROM ARE YOU 
AS CRITICAL ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES 
HAD HE MADE THOSE KIND OF VALUE 
JUDGEMENTS ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES 
YOU COULD BE IN FOR ALL SORTS OF 
FLAK COULDN'T YOU 
YES WE ARE WE 
TRY TO TEACH TO TREAT ALL 
COUNTRIES THE SAME ALL I WOULD SAY 
IS THIS YEAR IS QUITE A BALANCED 
VIEW A LOT OF THE QUOTA BEEN TAKEN 
OUT OF CONTEXT SANDRA PAY IT IS 
NOT BUT THERE IS A CERTAIN GLAMOUR 
PEOPLE FROM ABROAD WILL GO TO 
TORQUAY IT IS NOT SANTA PAY BUT 
THERE WILL BE LITTLE OLD LADIES 
HAVING TEA GOOD TO SPEAK TO YOU BOTH 
THE HEADLINES ON B. B. C. NEWS TWENTY FOUR TWO 
UN REFUGEE AID TRUCKS HAVE BEEN 
ALLOWED INTO BURMA THERE ARE 
REPORTED TO BE CARRYING TENTS TO 
PROVIDE SHELTER AFTER LAST WEEK'S 
CYCLONE HEAD TEACHERS ARE 
CONCERNED THAT STUDENTS ARE BEING 
PUT UNDER PRESSURE BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE TOO MANY EXAMS IN SINGLE DAY 
SOME PUPILS ARE SPENDING SEVEN 
HOURS SITTING EXAMS 
IT IS ILLEGAL TO SELL ALCOHOL TO 
ANYONE UNDER EIGHTEEN BUT SO WOULD 
WHEN THEY BOUGHT ONLINE THERE IS NO 
LAW TO PROVE THAT CUSTOMERS ARE OLD 
ENOUGH NEXT WEEK A BILL TO RECTIFY 
THAT WILL GET ANOTHER READING IN 
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS COULD AGE BUT 
EVERETT CUDD AGE VERIFICATION BE 
MADE TO WORK 
ALEXANDER IS SIXTEEN AND IS AN AVID USER 
OF THE INTERNET MANY TEENAGERS USE 
THE WEB TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH 
OTHER AND PYESTOCK ON LINE SOME OF 
IT ILLEGALLY 
D. V. D. S. BOOKS THE THINGS THEY SHOULD 
NOT BUY ALCOHOL KNIVES GUNS EVEN 
ONE OF MY FRIENDS BOUGHT SOME 
ALCOHOL ON LINE IT WAS VERY EASY 
TO BUY IT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT 
CHECK HIS AGE HE JUST PUT THE 
DETAILS FROM THE CARD ON TO THE 
COMPUTER AND BOUGHT IT IN SECONDS 
CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO MANDATORY 
LAWS FORCING ARE LIVE FREE ONLINE 
RETAILERS TO VERIFY WHETHER SOMEONE 
IS OLD ENOUGH TO BE SOLD PRODUCTS 
LIKE ALCOHOL OR KNIVES BETTING 
FIRMS ARE OBLIGED TO CHECK SOMEONE 
IS OLD ENOUGH TO GAMBLE ON LINE 
THEY ARE INCREASINGLY USING THE 
LATEST SOFTWARE TO VERIFY AGES HOW 
DOES THIS SYSTEM WORK IF I WANT TO 
REGISTER WITH A GAMBLING WEBSITE 
SUCH AS THIS ONE I ENTER SOME 
PERSONAL DETAILS ONLINE SUCH AS MY 
NAME DATE OF BIRTH AND THE ADDRESS 
I AM REGISTERED TO VOTE THAT IS 
CHECKED AGAINST PUBLICLY HELD DATA 
THAT CAN TELL ME INSTANTANEOUSLY 
WHETHER I AM OVER EIGHTEEN OR NOT THIS 
FRIDAY THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WILL 
DISCUSS THE NEXT STAGE OF PRIVATE

COMPANIES TO CHECK THEIR CUSTOMER'S 
AGE THAT SHOULD BE GOOD NEWS FOR 
PARENTS AND FOR COMPANIES LIKE THE 
G. B. GROUP WHICH ALREADY SELLS EIGHTY PER CENT 
OF ALL AGE VERIFICATION SOFTWARE TO 
GAMBLING WEBSITE THE TAKE UP HAS 
BEEN SLOWED BY THE REST OF 
BRITAIN'S ONLINE RETAILERS 
THE FIRST RETAILERS TO EMBRACE THIS 
NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL SEE A SLIGHT 
INCREASE IN THE TIME IT TAKES TO 
PERFORM THE TRANSACTION THE SLIGHT 
INCREASE IN COST AND THEREFORE 
LOSS OF COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE 
UNLESS THESE CHECKS ARE MADE 
OBLIGATORY PARENTS WILL STILL 
WONDER WHAT THEIR KIDS ARE BUYING 
ONLINE ONLINE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THERE ALI 
AIR ALI SIGNIFICANT INSTANCES OF 
YOUNGSTERS BUYING PRODUCTS ONLINE 
NO RETAILER WOULD HAVE INTEREST IN 
SELLING THOSE KINDS OF THINGS TO 
YOUNGSTERS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF 
PROTECTIONS IN PLACE WEBSITES 
USUALLY NEEDED TO REGISTER THAT 
WOULD BE A LINK WITH AN I. D. CHECK 
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU BUY SOMETHING 
LIKE OUR COHORT THE RETAILER WITH 
ONLY DELIVER TO YOU FACE TO FACE
