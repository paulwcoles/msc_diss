GOOD EVENING FROM THE CRUCIBLE

BE CENTRE 
STAGE TO 
TO WIN THROUGH TO THE SECOND ROUND 
OF THIS WORLD SNOOKER CHAMPIONSHIP 
THE FINAL FRAMES OF THEIR FIRST 
ROUND MATCH 
ARE ABOUT 
TO BE 
PLAYED 
AND SO 
FAR THINGS HAVE GONE BADLY 
WRONG FOR THE IRISHMAN FORMER 
WORLD CHAMPION KEN DOHERTY 
LIANG WENBO 
IF YOU LOSE THE FIRST FRAME HE 
WOULD BE FORGIVEN FOR LETTING YOUR 
HEAD DROP JUST A LITTLE HOWEVER 
IF THAT SAME OPPONENT GIVES YOU THIRTY SIX 
POINTS AT THE START OF FRAME TO 
YOU COULD BE IN WITH A CHANCE 
PARTICULARLY 
IF YOU 
ARE ALSO 
CAPABLE OF THIS 
AND OF THE STARTS HAPPENING TO YOU 
AS WELL THEN MAYBE JUST MAYBE 
YOU WOULD THINK THIS COULD BE YOUR 
DAY AND IF THIS STARTS HAPPENING 
TO YOU NOTHING BUT NOTHING WAS 
GOING RIGHT FOR KEN THIS IN OFF 
PUTTING AN END TO A POSSIBLE 
COMEBACK IN FRAME NUMBER FOUR THREE TO ONE 
TO LIANG WENBO AT THE INTERVAL 
BACK FROM THE BREAK LIANG WENBO 
WAS FIRST AMONG THE BALLS BUT KEN 
HAD A GREAT CHANCE TO WIN THE FRAME 
UNTIL THIS MISS LET HIM DOWN IT 
TOOK HIM A FEW GOES BUT KEN FINALLY 
GOT HIMSELF BACK ON THE SCORE BUT 
THE SCOREBOARD IN THE SIXTH TO TRAIL 
BY FOUR FRUIT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY TWO BUT HE WAS 
PROMPTLY ENGULFED BY A CRIMSON TIDE 
LIANG WENBO IS RENOWNED FOR MAKING 
HALF CENTURY PLUS BREAKS IN THE 
LAST THREE FRAMES OF THE SESSION 
GOT 
HE GOT HIGH BREAKS AND HE WAS FIRMLY IN THE DRIVING SEAT 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE SECOND FAVOURITE 
KICKS OFF HIS CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE 
TALENTED ANTHONY HAMILTON THIS 
EVENING BUT WE ARE GOING TO 
CONCENTRATE ON TABLE ONE IT IS A 
BIG ASK FOR KEN HE HAS TO PLAY 
GOOD SAFETY AND POT EVERY BALL 
GOOD EVENING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN

MARATHON NOT A SPRINT WHAT DRAMA

DUBLIN KEN DOHERTY 
PRESS THE RED BUTTON TO CHOOSE 
WHICH MATCH YOU WOULD LIKE TO USE 
IN THE COMMENTARY BOX FOR THE KEN 
DOHERTY AT THE END END BOUQUET 
WENBO MATCH IT 
WHAT A RECEPTION THE PLAYERS HAVE 
HAD HERE THE CHINESE SENSATION SEVEN 
TWO UP AGAINST KEN DOHERTY 
ANOTHER LEFT HANDER AND WHAT A 
RECEPTION HE DID GET WHEN HE 
ENTERED THE CRUCIBLE THEATRE BUT I 
THINK HE DID COME OUT TWICE GOOD START FROM KEN 
THAT IS A BAD MISTAKE FROM KEN 
ONLY SHE ONLY A SAFETY SHOT 
AVAILABLE TO HIM 
WHEN I SAID HE CAME OUT INTO THE 
CRUCIBLE TWICE WHEN OUR COMPARE 
ROB WALKER INTRODUCED THE REFEREES 
LIANG WENBO CAME OUT WITH THEM HE 
THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN INTRODUCED HE 
HAD TO GO BACK AGAIN AND THE CROWD 
ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT WASN'T THAT 
FANTASTIC JOHN 
YES AND HE SAW 
THE FUNNY SIDE OF IT THAT IS 
REALLY A DEBUT BOY ISN'T IT BUT 
HE HAS GOT A NICE LEAD SO HE IS 
COMFORTABLE AT THE MOMENT KEN 
DOHERTY HAD 
THERE 
DISAPPOINTED TO ONLY SCORE FOR 
ANOTHER CHANCE OF A POT HERE AS 
JOHN PARROTT SAID JUST BEFORE THEY 
WERE INTRODUCED HE HAS GOT TO PLAY 
WELL AND EVERYTHING HE LOOKS AT HE 
HAS GOT TO GET HE'S IN THE 
POSITION WHERE HE CAN'T MAKE ANY 
MORE MISTAKES BUT HE IS 
EXPERIENCED THIS IS A TERRIFIC 
OPENING RED NOT GREAT ON THE 
COLOUR AS I SAY HE'S GOT LOTS OF 
EXPERIENCE THE ONE THING YOU HAVE 
GOT TO DO WHEN YOU 
ARE IN 
THIS 
POSITION YOU HAVE 
GOT TO 
TRY AND 
PUT THE SCORE LINE OUT OF YOUR MIND 
AND PLAY FRAME FOR FRAME 
YES AND THE OTHER THING THAT KEN 
DOHERTY HAS ON HIS MIND IF HE 
LOSES THIS MATCH HE IS OFF TO THE 
QUALIFIERS AND WILL BE HEADING TO 
PONTIN'S WITH QUITE NUMBER OF 
OTHER PLAYERS AND THAT IS A TOUGH 
SCHOOL JIMMY WHITE HAS TRIED THIS 
YEAR AND VERY DIFFICULT ONCE YOU 
DROP OUT OF THAT ELITE TOP SIXTEEN IT 
IS VERY TOUGH TO GET BACK IN 
THAT WASN'T THE BEST OF SHOTS HE 
HAS BEEN RESCUED BY THE BLACK BUT 
FOR THE BLACK GOING IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE TABLE HE WOULD 
HAVE LEFT 
AN 
EASY RED ON HERE THE BLACK CAME TO 
HIS RESCUE THAT WAS CARELESS AS I 
SAY I CAN'T AFFORD MISTAKES NOW 
HE CAN'T AFFORD MISTAKES 
HE MIGHT 
STILL KNOCK THIS ONE IN NEAR THE 
BLACK SPOT 
HE IS TALKING I WAS TALKING TO 
JOHN HIGGINS IN THE PLAYERS' ROOM 
YESTERDAY HE WAS UP AT THE ACADEMY 
PRACTISING WITH LIANG WENBO HE 
SAID KEN 
WAS GOING 
TO HAVE 
A TOUGH 
MATCH BECAUSE 
HE SAID 
THIS 
MAN IS A FANTASTIC PLAYER IT THE 
FIRST TIME 
I HAVE 
SEEN HIM 
JOHN I 
DON'T SUPPOSE YOU HAVE SEEN 
HIM BEFORE 
A O. 
I HAVEN'T NO I HAVEN'T 
HE HAS BEEN LUCKY AGAIN HE HAS BEEN VERY FORTUNATE KEN HE 
NEEDS A BIT OF LUCK AND HE HAS HAD 
IT THERE LAST TWO VISITS 
IT WAS A BRILLIANT SHOT BUT HE DID 
FOULED THE BLUE HOW HE MANAGED GET THE WHITE BACK TO THAT POSITION 
BUT HE 
HAD TO 
FORCE IT 
AND WATCH 
THE CUE THERE HE JUST CATCHES THE 
BLUE THAT WAS LIKE BIT OF SMOKE 
COMING OFF THE CUE TIP THERE JOHN 
LIKE SMOKING GUN LET'S HAVE 
LOOK AT THIS WHAT A NICE SHOT THAT 
IS 
WHEN WE USED TO TO OUR LITTLE SOME 
REAL PLAYERS ABOUT THEIR STRENGTHS 
AND THEIR WITNESSES WHEN WE TALK 
ABOUT KEN DOHERTY WE ALWAYS USED 
TO SAY ABOUT HIS BATTLING QUALITIES 
THAT IS WHAT HE IS LOOKING AT HE 
IS JUST WORRIED ABOUT THE CUE BALL JUST WORRIED VERY WELL PLAYED 
HE HAS GOT THE RED TO THE RIGHT 
MIDDLE BUT HE WOULD LOVE 
TO PLAY 
THE RED 
TO THE 
RIGHT CORNER IN 
POTTING THAT 
HE WOULD 
RELEASE THE 
OTHER RED NEXT TO IT 
DESPERATELY NEEDS A GOOD START HERE 
KEN 
NO NEED TO GO INTO THEM JUST YET A 
COUPLE OF REDS HE CAN PLAY ON THE 
ONE TO THE RIGHT OF THE BUNCH IS 
AVAILABLE 
ONE OF THOSE SHOTS WHERE IF YOU 
OVERDO IT FOR ONE HAVE THE OTHER 
TO THE MIDDLE POCKET FALLS MIDDLE 
POCKET 
I DON'T THINK THIS RED POTS SO HE 
HAS LEFT AND SEVEN ANGLE ON THE 
BLUE PURPOSELY TO GO INTO THE PINK 
AND RED HE HAS LEFT HIMSELF AN 
ANGLE IT IS VERY TIGHT THAT IS 
WHY 
HE PLAYED THE SHOT AS 
HE NEEDS 
A BIT OF LUCK HERE I 
THINK HE IS O. K. 
THAT IS INCH 
PERFECT WHAT A CHANCE HE HAS 
CREATED FOR HIMSELF NOW OH WAS 
THAT A KICK OR WAS HE PLAYING WITH 
A BIT OF SIDE AND IT THREW OFF IT 
WAS A 
KICK AND A HALF THAT 
WAS A TERRIBLE CONTACT 
THE RED STRAIGHTENED UP THAT IS 
ALL YOU NEED WHEN YOU ARE SEVEN TWO 
BEHIND AND YOU ARE IN THE BALLS 
WITH A CHANCE TO TAKE THE FIRST 
FRAME OF THE SESSION 
THE ONLY FRAME I HAVE SEEN OF THE 
OPENING SESSION WAS THE LAST FRAME 
KEN SAT IN THE SEAT WHILE THIS 
YOUNG MAN MADE A BREAK OF NINETY FIVE TO 
GIVE IN AT SEVEN TO TWO LEAD GIVE HIM 
THAT SEVEN TO TWO LEAD 
I JUST SAID HE 
DEVELOPED THE BALLS PERFECTLY 
NEEDED A GOOD START IF HE COULD 
HAVE WON THE FRAME IN ONE VISIT 
WHAT A CONFIDENCE BOOSTER THAT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN NOW WILLIE GET 
ANOTHER CHANCE THIS FRAME THAT IS 
THE QUESTION WILL HE GET ANOTHER 
CHANCE 
HE IS ON THIS RED BUT HE DIDN'T 
PLAY TO BE ON IT 
WELL ONCE AGAIN HE'S NOT ON THE 
RED HE PLAYED FOR WHAT'S THE 
ALTERNATIVE LIKE 
HE HAS A RED INTO THE RIGHT CORNER 
HE IS GOING TO NEED THE EXTENSION 
DEPENDING ON THE ANGLE HE HAS HE 
MIGHT BE 
ABLE TO 
PLAY A DELICATE 
LITTLE SCREW SHOT 
OFF A 
COUPLE OF 
CUSHIONS TO LEAVE HIMSELF ON THE 
BLACK OR A COUPLE OF CHOICES TO THE 
MIDDLE THE ANGLE MIGHT BE THAT HE 
HAS TO USE A COUPLE OF CUSHIONS WE 
WILL FIND OUT SHORTLY IF HE CAN 
SCREW IT STRAIGHT OVER THAT WOULD 
BE BETTER YES HE COULD DO HE 
COULD HOLD IT 
WELL THIS WOULD BE A BIG BODY BLOW 
FOR KEN DOHERTY WOULDN'T IT 
HE HAD A GREAT CHANCE AND HE WAS 
PLAYING WITH A TOUCH OF SIDE IT 
WAS A MIXTURE OF THAT AND THE HEAVY 
CONTACT THAT CAUSED HIM TO MISS THE 
RED 
HE PLAYED THE CANNON AND PLAYED IT 
PERFECTLY WHEN HE POTS THE BLACK 
THE SCORES WILL BE LEVEL 
A LITTLE BIT LOW ON THIS BLACK THAN 
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED HE WILL HAVE 
TO PLAY A DELICATE SOFT STUN HERE 
TO 
HOLD FOR 
THE RED IN THE MIDDLE 
PLAYED IT WELL IT IS IMPERATIVE OF 
THIS RED HE GETS A GOOD ANGLE ON 
THE COLOUR OFF THIS RED 
HE HAS GOT A TERRIFIC ALL ROUND 
GAME THIS FELLOW VERY IMPRESSED 
AS I MENTIONED JOHN HIGGINS WAS 
VERY IMPRESSED WITH HIM WHEN HE 
PRACTISED WITH HIM AT THE ACADEMY 
IN SHEFFIELD IT IS WHERE ALL THESE 
OVERSEAS PLAYERS BASED THEMSELVES 
THEY HAVE GOT FANTASTIC PLAYING 
CONDITIONS BASE THEMSELVES A 
QUICK GLANCE AT THE SCORE BOARD 
THIS IS THE KEY SHOT THE YELLOW IS 
NOT TOO BADLY PLACED 
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE ON 
THAT ONE HE KNEW THAT WOULD PAVE 
THE WAY TO GIVE IN THIS OPENING 
FRAME AND EXTEND HIS LEAD SO YOU 
CAN EXPECT HIM TO MISS THE ODD SHOT 
NOT CUEING THE BALL THAT WELL EASY 
JOHN HE TRIED TO GET IN BEHIND THE 
BLACK THERE AND LOOK HOW FAR AWAY 
HE WAS FROM IT JUST A LITTLE LACK 
OF CONFIDENCE AT THE MOMENT AND THE 
SCORELINE WOULD CAUSE THAT 
THAT IS EXTREMELY UNLUCKY AND 
UNLIKELY TO KNOCK THE GREEN IN 
AND KEN CAN GET THROUGH TO THE RED 
IT IS A QUARTER BALL CUT SO IT IS 
NOT EASY HE HAS COME TO THE POINT 
IN THE MATCH THAT SHOTS LIKE THIS 
HE HAS GOT TO BE GETTING 
IT IS NOT BAD HE CAN GET TO THE 
YELLOW HE HAS A LONG WAY TO TRAVEL 
BUT THERE IS PATH HE CAN AVOID 
THE PINK BUT HE HAS GOT IT PRETTY 
CLOSE TO THE YELLOW JUST THE PINK 
SLIGHTLY IN THE WAKE MAYBE 
HE MAY 
THINK THAT THE BEST BALL TO PLAYED 
TO GET ON THE YELLOW WOULD BE THE 
BROWN 
HE DID NOT WANT THE KISS ON THE 
BROWN THAT SPOILED IT CAN HE GET 
IN BEHIND THE BROWN NOW HE COULD 
PUT LIANG WENBO IN ALL SORTS OF 
TROUBLE 
YES HE PLAYED A GOOD SHOT TROUBLE THERE HE NEARLY GOT THE PERFECT 
LINE STOP BUT I THINK HE WOULD BE PLEASED 
TO GET 
BACK 
TO 
BE BACK IN THIS FRAME WHEN 
LIANG WENBO 
HAD 
THAT CHANCE AT THE LAST RED IT 
LOOKED ODDS ON 
HE WAS GOING TO WIN 
THE FRAME 
IT IS A MUST WIN FRAME 
FOR KEN DOHERTY EIGHT TO TWO YOU 
COULD NOT SEE HIM COMING BACK FROM 
THAT 
HE PLAYED IT WELL TO GET IN BEHIND 
THE BROWN 
PLAYED IT VERY WELL HE 
GOT THE SNOOKER EASY ENOUGH TO HIT 
YOU WOULD THINK BUT THE OLD 
PROBLEM CAN YOU HIT IT AND GET IT 
SAFE 
AND HE COULDN'T I THINK KEN CAN 
GET ENOUGH SIDE ON THIS TO GET OUT 
BEHIND THE GREEN IF HE GETS LOT 
OF LEFT HAND SIDE HE MIGHT BE ABLE 
TO JUST COME IN AND LEAVE THE GREEN 
AND LITTLE BIT LITTLE BIT FURTHER 
THAN THE 
END OF THE LINE 
WOULD BE O. K. 
HE PLAYED IT PERFECTLY 
HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TOO STRAIGHT 
ON THE SCREEN IF HE IS HE CAN'T 
GET COULD CLOSE POSITION ON THE 
BROWN THE BROWN IS NOT EASY ALONG 
THAT BAULK CUSHION L. THINK HE IS 
STRAIGHT ENOUGH OH VERY STRAIGHT 
WALKER SAYS HAWK EYE SAYS WHAT WHAT A PRESSURE POT THIS IS GOING TO BE 
DOES HE PLAY THE POT DENNIS THE THE WAY HE IS LOOKING HE HAS GOT TO 
TAKE IT ON L. DON'T THINK HE SENT 
THE WHITE THROUGH QUITE AS FAR AS 
HE INTENDED THERE WITH THAT STUN 
RUN THROUGH 
HE HAS OVER CUT IT HE DIDN'T 
REALLY FANCY IT DID HE HE DIDN'T 
GET A GOOD WHITE 
I AM SAT IN THE 
COMMENTARY BOX AND I DIDN'T FANCY 
IT EITHER HE WANTED TO RUN THROUGH 
A COUPLE OF INCHES MORE SO IT WAS 
JUST NATURAL TO POT THE BROWN AND 
COME DOWN TO THE FOR THE BLUE HE 
HAS GIVEN THE YOUNG CHINESE LAD 
ANOTHER CHANCE 
JUST GOT TO BE 
CAREFUL IF HE SCREWS ACROSS THE 
TABLE THAT HE DOESN'T GO NEAR THE 
MIDDLE POCKET JUST ABOVE HIS HEAD 
THERE HE HAS PLAYED IT WELL KEN CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS JUST THE PINK 
WELL KEN DOHERTY HAD A COUPLE OF 
CHANCES BUT HE DID NOT MANAGE TO 
TAKE THEM ANOTHER FRAME FOR THE 
AND CHINESE PLAYER TO GET ON THE 
BOARD HE NOW LEADS EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY TWO 
THIS IS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT AS KEN 
DOHERTY HAS IT BEEN IN 
THE TOP 
SIXTEEN 
FOR THE 
LAST FIFTEEN YEARS IT LOOKS 
LIKE HE'S 
GOING OUT OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP AND THE TOP SIXTEEN YES YES HE WILL BE JOINING ME WITH THE 
QUALIFIERS AT PONTIN'S THAT IS A 
BODY BLOW HE WAS A LITTLE UNLUCKY 
EARLIER ON IN THE FRAME BUT AFTER 
THAT HE HAS HAD PLENTY OF CHANCES 
DO YOU THINK WE HAVE SEEN A 
CHARACTER HERE LIANG WENBO COMING 
OUT BEFORE HE WAS ANNOUNCED 
LAUGHING AND SPRINTING BACK QUITE 
A CHARACTER 
A COUPLE OF THE 
CRUCIBLE DEBUTANTS ARE CHINESE THIS 
YEAR ONE OF THEM CAME OUT AND 
COULD NOT FIND THE 
TOILETS AND 
WENT 
MISSING FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES IF THERE IS 
ANYBODY IN THE CRUCIBLE THEATRE WHO 
SEES A YOUNG CHINESE BOY WONDER I'D 
EMBASSY WILL YOU PLEASE M. IN THE 
RIGHT DIRECTION THESE BOYS ARE IN 
THE ACADEMY THEY ARE PLAYING 
AGAINST EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME 
THEY HAVE GREAT PRACTICE FACILITIES 
AND GREAT OPPONENTS TO PLAY AGAINST 
AND THEY ARE IMPROVING VERY QUICKLY 
LET'S HAVE CHECK ON WHO ELSE HAS 
BEEN WINNING SO FAR TODAY

BIT 
AND IT HAS BEEN INTERESTING 
WATCHING EVERYBODY ELSE TWITCHED

AT HOME 
WATCHING 
NOT 
REALLY FEELING 
PART 
OF IT 
SO TO 
COME IN 
AND 
PLAY WELL 
AND TO 
GET 
INTO THE 
TOURNAMENT NOW IS 
REALLY GOOD 
LIU CHANG TRAILS 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN BY FIVE TO FOUR GOING 
INTO THE SECOND SESSION OF THAT 
FIRST ROUND MATCH 
AND BACK TO DENNIS AND JOHN 
KEN DOHERTY HAS JUST BROKE OFF AND 
THAT IS WHERE HE LEFT THE CUE BALL 
A SNOOKER WHICH HE HAS FAILED TO 
ESCAPE FROM THEN THIS HAS BEEN 
CALLED BITE I AM ASSURED THAT IT 
WILL BE TAKEN THE MISS 
IF HE 
WAS TIGHT IN THE REDS THERE THAT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN AN EASY POT AND THE 
BLACK WAS NOT AVAILABLE HE JUST 
TOOK A MORE DIFFICULT ROUTE THERE 
THAN HE HAD TO 
BEAUTIFULLY PLAYED FROM KEN I I THOUGHT HE COULD COME OFF THE SIDE 
CUSHION AND VESSEL INTO THE BUNCH 
BUT HE TRIED A MORE DIFFICULT 
ESCAPE WHAT CHANCE OF LEAVING ONE 
THAT WAY MORE CHANCE 
THAT'S THE ONE IT'S ALL HISTORY 
KEN HAS A BIG TASK ON HIS HANDS NOW 
THAT IS NOT THE BEST SPLIT IT 
WASN'T EASY 
WHEN THE REDS ARE LIKE THAT IT IS 
NOT EASY TO OPEN THEM UP HE MIGHT 
TAKE THIS UP INTO THE CORNER IT 
WOULD NOT LEAVE 
A GREAT 
DEAL AND HE 
WOULD BE ON TO THE BLACK 
IT WAS VERY CLOSE IT IS GREAT IF 
YOU CAN START WINNING FRAMES IN ONE 
VISIT AND INCREASE THE GAP QUICKLY 
HE WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED TO 
HAVE LOST THAT FRAME WHEN LIANG 
WENBO GAVE HIM A COUPLE OF SECOND 
CHANCES THAT WAS A LITTLE 
I'M NOT 
SAYING THAT THIS RED IS EASY TO THE 
RIGHT MIDDLE POCKET THOSE TWO REDS 
ARE NOT FAR OFF PLANT FOR THE 
MIDDLE POCKET ALMOST TOUCHING SO 
YOU COULD MAKE IT 
I THINK HE COULD 
MAKE IT THE CAUSE THEY'RE TOUCHING 
HE COULD SQUEEZE IT BECAUSE 
BECAUSE THEY ARE CLOSE TOGETHER IF 
YOU HIT THE RED ON THE RIGHT SIDE 
IT WOULD STRAIGHTENED THE RED UP THEY'RE 
GOING 
TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF 
THE POCKET BUT IF YOU HIT A RED ON 
THE RIGHT SIDE AS YOU LOOK AT IT 
YOU WILL SENT THE OTHER TOWARDS THE 
POCKET 
IT IS ALL ACADEMIC NOW HE IS 
PLAYING A SHOT TO NOTHING HERE BUT 
HE IS PICKING SPORT ON THE CUSHION 
PICKING THE SPOT HE WILL TRY TO 
KNOCK THE RED ONTO THE SPORT ON THE 
CUSHION THAT HE HAS PICKED IT IS 
ALWAYS WORTH THE RISK SPOT 
HE IS NOT GETTING THROUGH THE BALL 
AT 
THE MOMENT HE COULD HAVE 
MADE 
AT THE MOMENT HE COULD HAVE MADE THIS A LOT EASIER THAT 
IS O. K. 
HAS TO 
TRY AND KEEP 
IT 
THAT IS O. K. HAS TO TRY AND KEEP IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE 
HE WANTED TO BE STRAIGHTER ON THIS 
RED L. DO NOT KNOW IF HE CAN PLAY 
FOR THE PINK THE BALL WILL BE 
TRAVELLING TOO FAR FOR COMFORT 
THE EASIEST RED TO GET ON IS THE 
ONE CLOSEST TO THE TOP CUSHION IF 
HE GETS DOWN TOWARDS THE BLACK SPOT 
HE MUST BE ON THE RED THAT SEEMS 
PERFECT WELL PLAYED 
HE IS LOOKING OUT ALL THE OPTIONS 
HE'S LOOKING TO SEE IF HE CAN GET 
ON THE PINK AND THEN CANNON INTO 
THE REDS IT IS QUITE EASY TO GET 
ON TO THE BLACK 
HE HAS FINISHED A LITTLE STRAIGHTER 
ON THE BLACK THAN HE INTENDED 
BECAUSE HE HAS TO DISTURB SOME OF 
THOSE REDS HE COULD HAVE LEFT A 
BETTER ANGLE THAN THIS 
I 
SURPRISED HE IS NOT PLAYING THE 
PINK HE PROBABLY THOUGHT THAT 
PLAQUE WAS UNMISSABLE BUT IF HE HAD 
PLAYED THE PINK HE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
NUDGING IT REDS OUT THE BLACK 
WAS UNMISSABLE 
HE DIDN'T JUST GET INTO IT HE 
TRIED TO SCREW THE BLACK IN HERE 
HE WAS TRYING TO GET ACROSS THE 
TABLE TO SCREW INTO POSITION FOR 
THOSE TWO REDS AND HE HAS COME UP LONG WAY SHORT POOR SAFETY SHOT FROM LIANG 
HE IS PLAYING THE OTHER ONE THIS 
IS THE MORE DIFFICULT FOR ME I I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT KEN HAS TAKEN 
THAT THE OTHER WAS AN EASIER POT 
HE HAS GOT TO TAKE THE OTHER ONE 
AND GET ON THE BLACK L. AM REALLY SURPRISED 
KEN REALLY IS UNDER THE COSH HE 
DIDN'T EVEN GET CLOSE TO THAT 
THERE IS SO MUCH RIDING ON THIS FOR 
THE IRISHMAN AS JOHN PARROTT WAS 
SAYING IF HE LOSES THIS MATCH HE 
IS BACK TO THE QUALIFIERS AND OFF 
TO PLAYING PONTIN'S AND THAT IS TOUGH LOOK AT THAT SHOT 
THIS ONE SHOT ALONE HAS GIVEN THE 
YOUNG CHINESE PLAYER THE CHANCE TO 
COME RIGHT BACK IN THIS FRAME 
HE HAS HIP THAT TO HOWARD HIT 
THAT TOO HARD 
HE JUST MANAGED TO STAY ON THE 
YELLOW AND HAS MANAGED TO CONTROL 
THE CUE BALL THERE KING COULD NOT 
TAKE ADVANTAGES OF MISTAKES IN THE 
FIRST FRAME AND HAS MADE SOME 
ELEMENTARY MISTAKES IN THIS FRAME 
KEN HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO CAPITALISE 
YOU ALWAYS FELT THAT IF KEN COULD 
CLOSE THE GAP AND PUT PRESSURE AND 
THEN BUT HE HAS NOT PUT ANY 
PRESSURE ON THEM AND HE IS NOT 
WELL HE IS SITTING IN THAT SEAT 
THE PINK WILL GO ON THE BLUE SPOT 
SO ALL THE REDS ARE IN POTABLE 
POSITIONS POTTABLE THIS IS A TOUGH BLACK NOW 
AND BEING A LEFT HANDER HE IS 
GOING TO HAVE TO USE THE REST BUT 
THERE AT LEAST IF HE POTS THE BLACK 
HE MAY FINISH UP ON THE RED NEXT TO 
THE GREEN HE IS SCREWING THIS DONE 
HE IS PLAYING TO HOLD 
THE WHITE 
UP 
THIS END OF THE TABLE NOT QUITE 
THAT KICK HAS COME TO THE RESCUE OF 
KEN DOHERTY 
YOU COULDN'T HAVE PUT 
IT ANY BETTER NOW CAN KEN TAKE 
ADVANTAGE HE WAS UNLUCKY THERE 
THE YOUNG MAN 
THE IF THE HE JUST CHECKING THE 
REFEREE HE JUST CHECKING THAT KEN 
WAS NOT GOING TO FOUL UP THE BALL 
WITH HIS SLEEVE THERE YOU SEE DO 
IF AND HE JUST CHECKING THINGS 
THE IF IT HE THE REFEREE BROWN BALL 
WHERE'S THIS RED GOING IT HAS JUST 
NUDGED THE WHITE L. DON'T KNOW IF 
KEN WILL THINK ABOUT TAKING ON THIS 
RED DOWN THE CUSHION OR MAYBE THE 
RED TO THE RIGHT OF THE BLACK GOES 
IN THE CORNER IT MUST DO HE IS 
TAKING A TORN NO CONTROL OVER THE CUE BALL 
HE'S COMING ROUND TO HAVE A LOOK 
IT MAY JUST CLIP INTO THE MIDDLE 
POCKET THIRTY EIGHT POINTS IN THE LEAD JUST 
THIS RED AND IT'S IN HE HAS 
SCRAPED OVER THE LINE SOMEHOW HE 
HAS HAD PLENTY OF CHANCES BUT 
WHERE AND WHEN WAR COULD NOT TAKE 
HIS LIANG WENBO 
IT SHOULD BE ENOUGH COLOUR ALL WILL 
THE YOUNG MAN IS CARRYING ON AN 
EASY SNOOKER HERE YOU'D HAVE 
THOUGHT 
HE HAS GOT TO BE CAREFUL THAT HE 
DOES NOT SLIP IN BEHIND THIS RED 
IT IS O. K. 
AT THE MOMENT THREE FOUR POINT 
SNOOKERS REQUIRED BUT THERE IS 
ALWAYS THE CHANCE OF A THREE FREE 
BALL 
THAT WAS A TREMENDOUS EFFORT HE 
KNOWS HIS WAY AROUND THE SNOOKER 
TABLE NOT ONLY A POTTER AND BREAK 
BUILDER 
IT WILL HAVE TO BE A GOOD SNOOKER 
TO CAUSE KEN DOHERTY TO FOUL 
HE'S GOT THE SNOOKER BUT IT'S A 
VERY DIFFICULT ONE LOT A VERY 
DIFFICULT WHEN IT TO HIT NOT 
THE BALLS ARE PRETTY WELL PLACED 
FOR SNOOKERS THERE YOU CAN GET IN 
BEHIND THE GREEN OR BLACK IT IS 
VERY DIFFICULT TO ESCAPE FROM 
I THINK HE REALISED THAT IT IS 
ALMOST AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK IT IS 
STILL NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR KEN 
DOHERTY EVEN THOUGH HE WON THAT 
FRAME AS HE TRAILS IT THREE 
HAVE THE SCIENTISTS WHAT DOUBT WHAT 
KICKS AND CONTACTS ARE ALL ABOUT 
IT IS INEXPLICABLE 
THE ONE THAT 
LIANG WENBO HAS JUST HAD IS AN 
ABSOLUTE HOWLER YOU JUST GET THAT 
MANY EXPLOSION IT JUMPS UP AND THE 
AIR AND IT TAKES ALL THE PACE OUT 
OF THE CUE BALL AND HE HAS HAD TO 
COME UP WITH A BIT SCIENTISTS HAVE 
COME UP WITH THINGS LIKE CHALK 
BETWEEN THE CONTRACTS AND STATIC 
ELECTRICITY BUT WHEN IT HAPPENS IT 
IS HORRIBLE 
HOW IS KEN DOHERTY 
GOING TO WIN THIS GAME 
HE HAS GOT 
TO IGNORE THE SCORE LINE THAN THE 
VERY FRAME BECOMES A MATCH JUST 
PLAY EACH FRAME AS AN INDIVIDUAL 
MATCH AND CLAW YOUR WAY BACK IN 
YOU COULD SEE IN THE EYES OF KEN 
DOHERTY THEIR HOW MUCH HE WAS 
CONCENTRATING 
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO WHEN I BROUGHT 
OUT AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY I CALLED IT 
FRAME 
BY FRAME AND THAT IS THE WAY 
HE SHOULD BE PLAYING THIS MATCH 
YOU SHOULD PLAY EVERY MATCH LIKE 
THAT BUT IT TAKES SOME DOING THAT 
IS WHERE KEN'S GREAT EXPERIENCE 
SHOULD COME INTO PLAY AT THE 
MOMENT PLAYING HOURS HE IS AT THE 
MOMENT HE CANNOT WIN THIS MATCH 
YOU COULD COME IN WITH A ONE HUNDRED BREAK 
AND OR THE SUDDEN YOU'RE CONFIDENCE 
COMES BACK 
THIS IS NOT A FREAK 
SHOT HE MAY STILL HAVE A GO ABOUT 
IT HE HAS GOT TO MAKE 
SURE HE 
GETS 
THE WHITE BACK FAR 
ENOUGH OR 
HE 
WILL LEAVE THE OTHER RED WHAT A 
POT THAT IS AND LOOK WHERE THE 
WHITE GOES HE DID NOT PLAY THAT AS 
A SHOT TO NOTHING WHAT A SHOT THAT 
WAS 
HE DECIDED NOT TO HOLD FOR THE 
BLACK HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE GOOD ANGLE ON THE 
BLUE BUT 
HE HAS 
TOO STRAIGHT AND WILL 
NOW HAVE 
TO 
PLAY FOR 
ONE OF THOSE LOOSE REDS 
IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE GOT 
TO TRY 
AND 
HOLD FOR 
THE BLACK 
WITH 
THE REDS 
EITHER SIDE 
OF THE BLUE IT DID NOT 
MATTER 
HOW HE 
GOT ON TO THE BLUE IT IS A STRETCH TO GET TO THIS BUT 
IT IS 
NOT GOING 
TO BE 
EASY TO KNOCK 
IN A SIZEABLE BREAK HERE 
IT LOOKS LIKE KEN DOHERTY IS ON HIS 
WAY OUT OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP THIS 
IS WHERE WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT ON B. B. C. 
TWO ON THE OTHER TABLE THE SEMI 
FINALS LAST YEAR SCOTLAND'S STEVE 
MAGUIRE IS PLAYING AND ANTHONY
