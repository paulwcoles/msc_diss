HELLO AGAIN FROM THE CRUCIBLE BY 
THE END OF TODAY WE WILL KNOW THE 
LINE UP FOR THE SEMI FINALS OF THIS 
EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT C. O. M. WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP FOUR 
PLAYERS HAVE TAKEN A STEP NEARER 
GETTING THEIR NAME ON THE HONOURS 
BOARD THREE OF THE QUARTER 
FINALISTS ARE ALREADY ON THEIR ONE 
OF THEM SEVEN TIMES STEPHEN HENDRY 
KING OF THE CRUCIBLE ALREADY ON 
THERE 
IT MEANT MORE THAN THE LAST SIX PUT 
TOGETHER I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER 
THE SEVENTH AS MY BIGGEST ACHIEVEMENT 
AND GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT IN SNOOKER 
A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT TO LOSE IN 
THE FINAL FRAME IT IS PROBABLY MY 
BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT IN SNOOKER 
LOSING THAT FINAL PETER IS A 
FANTASTIC PLAYER AND HE IS MUCH 
BETTER NOW THAN THEN I DIDN'T 
BELIEVE HE COULD POSSIBLY BEAT ME 
OVER TWO DAYS IF YOU LET RONNIE 
GET BULLIED ON YOU YOU WILL 
STRUGGLE TO PICK HIM BACK GET A 
LEAD ON YOU IT WAS JUST AL BAD 
MATCH FROM MORE OR LESS START TO 
FINISH FOR ME BUT I WOULDN'T SAY 
THAT IS THE CAUSE OF MY DEMISE OVER 
THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS IT HAS 
JUST BEEN DOWN TO BAD PLAYED AND 
ONE OR TWO TECHNICAL THINGS BAD 
PLAY 
OF COURSE I AM THINKING ABOUT 
WINNING IT THAT IS WHAT I AM HERE 
TO DO I AM NOT HERE TO FINISH 
SECOND IT IS THE ONLY REASON I AM 
IN SHEFFIELD TO WIN THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP CHAMPIONSHIP OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS 
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY DOUBTERS OVER 
WHETHER STEPHEN HENDRY WOULD LIFT 
THIS FOR THE EIGHTH TIME 
HIS FORM ON 
THE MATCH TABLE HAS NOT BEEN GREAT 
HE HAS PLAYED WELL IN PRACTICE BUT 
YOU HAVE TO DO IT ON THE MATCH 
TABLE HE HAD A GOOD PERFORMANCE 
AGAINST MARK ALLEN 
HE SEEMS TO 
HAVE GOT HIS CONFIDENCE BACK HIS 
LONG POTTING IS GOING IN AND THEY 
ARE LESS UNFORCED ERRORS 
AS YOU 
GET OLDER CONCENTRATION GOES BUT 
HE HAS BEEN GOOD ON THAT 
HE HAS 
TURNED DOWN A FEW SHOTS IN FAVOUR 
OF SAFETY SHOTS 
MAYBE HE HAS BEEN 
WATCHING SOME STEVE DAVIS VIDEOS 
MAYBE HE HAS MATURED 
WE WILL FIND 
OUT IN HALF AN HOUR WHETHER HE CAN 
MATURED INTO THE SEMI FINALS WE WE WILL FIND HEAR MORE FROM STEVE 
DAVIS AND JOHN PARROTT LATER 
ACTION FIRST FROM ANOTHER QUARTER 
FINAL FEATURING ANOTHER FORMER 
WORLD CHAMPION IT IS PETER EBDON 
AGAINST ALI CARTER WHEN WORLD 
NUMBER SIX PETER AND WORLD NUMBER 
FOURTEEN ALI RETURNED TO THE CRUCIBLE 
LAST NIGHT THE ATMOSPHERE WAS 
INFECTIOUS THAT WAS IN THE LIGHT 
OF RONNIE O'SULLIVAN'S ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN PETER 
CLOSED IN ON YET ANOTHER MAXIMUM 
BREAK 
EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN DONE ALREADY IN 
THIS TOURNAMENT IT IS STILL A 
MAGIC MOMENT IN SNOOKER INCH 
PERFECT ON THE BLACK 
THEY NEVER 
HAVE BEEN TWO ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVENS IN THE SAME 
TOURNAMENT THEY NEVER HAVE BEEN 
THERE NEVER HAVE BEEN 
HE WANTED TO BE A LITTLE BIT 
STRAIGHT ON THIS RED HE HAS GIVEN 
HIMSELF LITTLE BIT TO DO HERE STRAIGHTER ON THIS RED 
IT IS NOT A NATURAL MAY NEED A 
TRACE OF RIGHT HAND SIDE TO GET ON 
THE BLACK 
WELL OPTED NOT TO PLAY AT THIS 
TIME BUT TO LEAVE THE CUE BALL AS 
A CONSEQUENCE FURTHER AWAY FROM 
THE BLACK 
BOY HE HAS LEFT HIMSELF 
A TOUGH ONE OH WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT 
NOTHING FOR A NEAR MISS I AM 
AFRAID FIFTEEN REDS FOURTEEN BLACKS ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN 
BUT THE MAXIMUM ELUDES HIM 
PETER AN INCH AWAY FROM BEING IN A 
GREAT POSITION TO HIT THE 
CRUCIBLE'S SECOND ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN IN TWO DAYS 
WHEN YOU HAVE WAITED FOR SOMETHING 
FOR A LONG TIME WHAT DO THEY SAY 
ABOUT BUSES IN THE NEXT FRAME ALI 
IS AT THE TABLE 
IF CARTER CAN WIN THIS FRAME HE 
CAN'T BE BEHIND OVERNIGHT 
IF HE DID WIN IT HE WOULD BE 
PUSHING IN THE LAST FRAME OF THE 
DAY FOR A NINE TO SEVEN OVERNIGHT LEAD 
YES IT HAS BEEN A VERY GOOD 
SESSION THE FIRST FRAME THIS 
EVENING EVERYBODY WAS FEARING THE 
WORST A LOT OF BALLS WERE MISSED 
AND IT SEEMED TO BE A PROTRACTED 
SAFETY BATTLE 
SINCE THEN WE HAVE HAD SOME SUPERB 
SNOOKER FROM BOTH PLAYERS 
WELL WE 
HAVE 
THE LOWEST HIGHEST BREAK IF I CAN 
PUT IT LIKE THAT HAS BEEN FIFTY FIVE IN 
THE NINTH FRAME IT CAME FROM CARTER 
WE HAVE HAD ONE HUNDRED FORTY THREE EIGHTY FOUR ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN FROM EBDON 
SEVENTY NINE AND EIGHTY ONE FROM CARTER 
IN BETWEEN THOSE EFFORTS SOME 
TACTICAL PLAY SOME SEARCHING FOR 
OPENINGS AND SOME MISTAKES WHICH 
ADDS TO THE FUND PAUL PAST 
ALTHOUGH NOT THE PLAYERS ADDS TO 
THE FUND FOR US 
YES I THINK THE 
ONLY THING THAT HAS DISAPPOINTED 
BOTH PLAYERS IS THE LONG POTTING 
PROBABLY ALLEY CARTER NOT AS MUCH 
AS PETER EBDON BUT WHEN THEY HAVE 
GOT IN AROUND THE BLACK SPOT AREA 
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE THEY THOUGHT 
ABOUT MAXIMUM BREAKS THIS EVENING 
KELLI CARTER ALI CARTER FIVE 
REDS 
FIVE BLACK'S FIVE BLACK'S 
FIVE REDS FIVE BLACK'S FIVE BLACK'S BLACKS 
CARTER HAS NEVER MADE A ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN IN 
COMPETITION L. L. THINK IF SOMEONE 
SAID TO HIM NOW O. K. WE WILL GIVE 
YOU THE FRAME IF YOU WILL FORGET 
ABOUT THE MAXIMUM HE MIGHT WELL 
TAKE IT 
BECAUSE IT IS WINNING THAT IS OF 
PRIME IMPORTANCE 
NEVERTHELESS STILL DOESN'T HAVE TO 
STRAIN FOR BLACK BALL POSITION AND 
IF HE 
DO S. 
GET TO SEVENTY THREE WITH THE REDS 
AND BLACKS YOU COULD BET HE WOULD 
BE GOING FOR THE MAXIMUM 
A LITTLE BIT SHORT IN TERMS OF 
RETAINING BLACK BALL POSITION OR 
IDEAL BLACK BALL POSITION 
HE HAS HAD A GOOD LOOK AT THAT 
PLANT 
NOW THAT HE HAS GOT IT THAT HAS 
IMPROVED HIS CHANCES ALTHOUGH HE 
IS A LITTLE LOW ON THE BLACK 
WELL IS HE ON THE RED HE HAS 
WALKED ROUND 
IS THIS NOT REMARKABLE CLIVE OR 
NOT PETER EBDON HAS JUST HAD A GO 
AT A MAXIMUM NOW NEXT FRAME 
WHEN I WAS PLAYING I DIDN'T 
REALISE THE I DIDN'T REALISE THE 
GAME WAS THESE EASY 
IT IS 
CERTAINLY A TERRIFIC STANDARD OF 
BREAK MAKING 
WELL HE IS O. K. HE IS O. K. I THOUGHT 
HE HAD GONE WRONG FOR A MINUTE BUT 
HE IS NICELY ON THIS RED TO THE 
RIGHT CORNER 
WELL PAST THE WINNING 
POST IN THE FRAME 
CARTER'S HIGHEST BREAK IN 
COMPETITION ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR WAS MADE HERE 
LAST YEAR 
THAT WAS THE LINE HE TOOK BEFORE 
AND IT WAS DANGEROUS ONE AM 
LOOKING AT HIS BODY LANGUAGE 
DON'T THINK HE IS QUITE ON THIS RED 
LET'S 
HAVE LOOK HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY THIS WITH RIGHT HAND 
SIDE AND TRY AND TURN THIS RED OVER 
PLAIN BALL HE CAN'T GET TO THE 
POTTING ANGLE HE COULD DO IT WITH 
A TRACE OF SIDE AND HE HAS DONE 
IT 
IT IS A LOT OF MONEY BUT HE 
MUSTN'T THINK ABOUT THAT HE HAS 
JUST GOT TO PLAY THIS SHOT BY SHOT 
JUST ASKING FOR THE CUE BALL TO BE 
CLEANED THERE IS ONE RED OPEN I'M 
NOT SURE ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF 
THE TWO REDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
TABLE 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY IF THE 
BOTTOM OF THOSE TWO REDS GOES FROM 
WHERE WE ARE SITTING HE HAS PLAYED 
IT INCH PERFECT NOW IF THOSE TWO 
REDS ARE NOT AVAILABLE HE CAN POT 
THIS AND JUST A LITTLE TOUCHED 
CANNON OFF THOSE TWO REDS AS HE 
SLIDES BY AND HE WILL BRING THEM 
INTO PLAY 
DIDN'T DO THAT SO WHAT DOES THAT 
TELL US DOES THE BOTTOM RED POT 
OR DOES HE HAD TO PLAY THE CANNON 
OFF THE BLACK 
PERFECT HE DIDN'T WANT TO RISK THE 
CANNON OFF THE PREVIOUS RED BUT HE 
COULD NOT HAVE HIT THAT BETTER 
WHAT A CHANCE 
ANY ANGLE ON THE BLACK WILL DO BUT 
HE HAS GOT TO GET HIGHER ON THIS 
RED UNLESS HE DECIDES TO PLAY FOR 
THE RED ON ONE OF THESE MIDDLE 
POCKETS 
HE HAS PLAYED FOR IT IN THE MIDDLE 
POCKET IT IS AS GOOD AS HE COULD 
HAVE HOPED FOR 
HE HAS GOT THE SKILL TO COMPLETE 
THIS MAXIMUM HAS HE ALSO GOT THE 
NERVE 
PERFECT THAT IS WHAT HE IS GOING 
TO TAKE NOW WHAT IT IS GOING TO 
TAKE NOW CLIVE NERVE AND PLENTY 
OF IT 
IT IS NOT JUST THE MONEY A HALF 
SHARE OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND IT IS 
THE DISTINCTION THE DISTINCTION OF 
HAVING MADE A MAXIMUM IN THIS 
THEATRE OF DREAMS 
AND A VIDEO OR 
D. V. D. TO SHOW YOUR GRANDCHILDREN 
A BIG MOMENT IN HIS CAREER THIS 
WAS ALWAYS COMING TO BE THE ONE 
BECAUSE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE 
BLUE AND PINK PLAY A GOOD ONE 
SON 
IT IS O. K. IT IS O. K. PRESSURE LOTS AND LOTS OF PRESSURE 
HAD TO PLAY IT TWICE ACROSS HE 
COULD HAVE DONE WITH FINISHING A 
LITTLE BIT NEARER THE BLACK O. K. O. K. DEEP BREATH MARVELLOUS MARVELLOUS 
ALI CARTER'S FIRST MAXIMUM IN 
COMPETITION WHAT A PLACE TO MAKE 
IT 
IT WAS A PURE ADRENALIN BUZZ TO DO 
THAT RONNIE DID IT BEFORE ME BUT 
IT IS NICE TO MAKE ONE AS WELL THE 
FIRST ONE OF MY CAREER AND HERE IT 
WAS SPECIAL IT WAS BRILLIANT 
HE WAS PROBABLY MORE NERVOUS THAN 
ANYBODY I HAVE EVER SEEN GOING FOR 
ONE THAT DID IT THAT IS A HUGE 
COMPLIMENT HE HELD HIMSELF 
TOGETHER IT WAS A WONDERFUL 
EXPERIENCE WATCHING HIM 
I WAS JUST 
PLAYING ON INSTINCT SHAKING LIKE A 
LEAF BUT I POTTED THE BALLS A A WONDERFUL OCCASION FOR HIM HE HAS 
PUT SO MUCH WORK INTO HIS GAME HE 
IS PLAYING TREMENDOUS SNOOKER 
AGAINST A TREMENDOUS PLAYER EBDON 
WHO HAS DONE TWO CENTURIES IT HAS 
BEEN A FABULOUS SESSION OF SNOOKER 
THE BEST WE HAVE SEEN 
TWO I GET 
HALF THE PRIZE MONEY THANK GOD FOR 
THAT TWO I GET 
WHAT DO YOU 
FANCY SPENDING IT ON 
A FORD FOCUS 
CONVERTIBLE I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED 
ONE 
YOU CAN DO A LOT WITH A ONE SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WELL PLAYED ALLEY CARTER 
YOU HAVE GOT TO GET SOME SORT OF 
CONVERTIBLE IF YOU MAKE THIS BREAK 
IT WAS INTRICATELY CONVERTED THE 
BALLS WERE NOT OPEN AT THE START 
ALI HAD TO REALLY THREAT HIMSELF 
AROUND A LOT OF DIFFICULT 
POSITIONAL SHOTS 
IT WAS GREAT PLAY 
THE RED WHERE HE HAD TO SWERVE 
ROUND AND USE BIT OF SIDE WAS GREAT 
WHERE ARE THERE SO MANY ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN GREAT ATTEMPTS THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY 
AND NOW THE FIRST DOUBLE THE THE CLOTHS ARE THINNER SO THE BALLS 
OPEN UP MORE BUT THAT WASN'T THERE 
GENERALLY PLAYERS ARE MORE 
PROFICIENT IN BREAK BUILDING JOHN 
VIRGO DID NOT REALISE THE GAME WAS 
SO EASY IN THAT DEPARTMENT PLAYERS 
HAVE COME TO TERMS WITH ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVENS BUT 
THE FIRST ONE IS STILL A BIG 
OCCASION 
PETER EBDON VERY OCCASION DIGNIFIED BECAUSE HE MISSED OUT ON 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN HE CELEBRATED WITH ALI 
AFTERWARDS 
IT WAS PLAYED IN THE AFTERWARDS GOOD SPIRIT L. WAS COMMENTATING ON 
THE OTHER MATCH EVERY TIME I 
LOOKED THEY SEEMED TO BE IN AROUND 
THE BLACK SPOT THERE WAS EVERY 
CHANCE OF ONE OF THEM MIGHT GET ONE 
AT WHAT STAGE TO THE PLAYERS ON THE 
OTHER TABLE START TO DOWN THEIR 
CUES AND SNEAK AROUND TO WATCH THIS 
OUT OF RESPECT HAVE NOTICED 
PLAYERS GET INVOLVED 
THEY HEAR 
CERTAIN NUMBERS LIKE SIXTY FOUR EIGHTY EIGHT 
SUDDENLY THEY REALISE THERE IS 
INTEREST WHEN IT GETS TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY 
THERE IS JUST THE COLOURS LEFT 
LAST NIGHT THEY HAD JUST COME BACK 
FROM THEIR INTERVAL THEY KNEW WHAT 
THE SCORES WERE RYAN CAME THROUGH 
TO CONGRATULATE HIM TO MAKE IT 
HERE AT THE CRUCIBLE IS VERY 
SPECIAL 
DO YOU HAVE A THEORY OF SPECIAL WHY THERE ARE SO MANY MORE ATTEMPTS 
AT MAXIMUMS 
THE PLAYERS ARE BETTER 
THERE ARE MORE OF THEM PLAYERS ARE 
PLAYING A HIGHER STANDARD AND THEY 
ARE MORE OF THEM 
AND THAT PRIZE 
MONEY PERHAPS HAS AN IMPACT 
EXACTLY RONNIE WILL BE SLIGHTLY 
DISAPPOINTED THAT NOW HE HAS HAD 
HIS MONEY HALVED HE IS GOING TO 
GET THAT BENTLEY BUT IN THE 
PASSENGER SEAT ALI WILL BE THERE 
AND THEY WILL HAVE ALTERNATE DAYS 
COULD THERE BE A THIRD WELL DONE 
ALI BECAUSE HE WENT BACK TO WIN 
THE FINAL FRAME OF THE SESSION TO 
LEAD NINE TO SEVEN TODAY THE TARGET FOR 
BOTH PLAYERS IS TO CLINCH A SEMI 
FINAL PLACE ON OFFER FOR ALI IT 
WOULD BE HIS FIRST TIME IN THE LAST 
FOUR IN THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
PETER IS AT THE TABLE HE IS ON A 
BREAK OF FORTY SEVEN COMMENTARY FROM TERRY 
GRIFFITHS AND NEAL FOULDS 
TEN MINUTES AGO A WOULD NOT HAVE 
GIVEN HIM ANY HOPE HE LOOKED AS IF 
HE HAD LOST CONTROL WELL AS NEAL 
SAID YOU WOULD HAVE PUT YOUR HOUSE 
ON HIM CLEARING UP HERE YOU COULD 
SEE SOME MOVEMENT ON THE SHOT L. 
WAS JUST SAYING HOW WELL HE HAS 
DONE HE LOOKED A VERY LOW MENTALLY 
HE LOOKED VERY LOW L. THINK IT 
JUST THE PINK WOULD HAVE BEEN 
ENOUGH FOR HIM TO CLEAR UP 
YES IT 
DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THERE WAS A MISS 
COMING IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS JUST 
GETTING INTO THIS AFTER A TOUGH 
MORNING FOR HIM SO FAR 
NOW A CHANCE FOR A LEAGUE MATCH 
ALI CARTER AND A GOOD ONE AS WELL 
THAT TWO POINT LEAD HE HAS GOT 
ACTUALLY MEANS MORE THAN WHAT YOU 
WOULD THINK IT MEANS HE CAN ONLY 
POT UP TO THE BLUE TO SECURE THE 
FRAME BARRING SNOOKERS 
HE STRUGGLED TO REACH THAT BUT HE 
PLAYED IT WELL IT IS THE KIND OF 
SHOT WHEN YOU HAVE THE EXTENSION 
THAT YOU CAN'T OVERHIT OR UNDERHIT 
ON THE SCREW SHOT THAT YOU CAN 
YOU CAN FEEL THE TENSION OUT THERE 
NOW 
HE ONLY NEEDS THE BLUE HE MUST 
HAVE MISCOUNTED 
IT LOOKED FOR ONE MINUTE THAT HE 
HAD PLAYED A BAD SHOT AND COULDN'T 
GET ON THE PINK WHEN YOU ARE UNDER 
PRESSURE THAT HAPPENS LOT YES YES BUT HE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THE SCORES 
HE MAY HAVE THOUGHT HE NEEDED UP TO 
THE PINK BUT HE DIDN'T 
WELL PLAYED HE DIDN'T CLEAR UP BUT 
BARRING SNOOKERS ALLISTER CARTER 
HAS TAKEN THIS FRAME 
IT WENT TO TWELVE TO NINE WOULD WE SEE 
ANOTHER PETER EBDON FIGHT BACK 
OH NO GOT TO SAY IF HE HAD JUST 
PLAYED FOR THE BLUE THERE AND TAKEN 
THE CHANCE HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE 
POTTED THAT RED 
YES I THINK PETER 
A LITTLE SMILE BECAUSE HE FELT 
UNLUCKY THAT HE LEFT IT ON THERE 
WERE PLENTY OF BALLS THAT COULD 
HAVE STOPPED HIM GETTING TO THAT 
RED THE BROWN THE YELLOW LOTS OF 
THINGS BUT HE HAS LEFT IT ON L. 
THINK HE FEELS HE HAS BEEN MADE TO 
PAY FOR HIS MISTAKES IN THIS 
SESSION AND I WOULDN'T ARGUE WITH 
THAT 
WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT TO SEE IF HE 
TAKES THE PINK MAYBE IT DOES GO 
BACK ON ITS SPOT 
IT WOULD BE A BIG AID FOR CARTER IF 
IT DOES THE BLACK ALSO GOES INTO 
THE RIGHT CORNER HE IS NOT GOING 
TO GET A BETTER CHANCE THAN THIS 
THE PINK IS IN THE OPEN THE FACT THE BLACK DUST POT MEANS THIS IS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY 
IT HAS BEEN A MATCH FEW PEOPLE WILL 
FORGET EBDON'S ONE HUNDRED FORTY THREE PALED INTO 
INSIGNIFICANCE BECAUSE HE REALLY 
MADE A MAXIMUM THE NEXT FRAME ALI 
CARTER DID MAKE THE MAGICAL ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN 
THAT WAS ALL LAST NIGHT BUT TODAY 
IT HAS NOT BEEN EBDON'S FASHION AT 
ALL CARTER HAS PLAYED ALL RIGHT 
HIS SESSION 
SOME APPLAUSE FROM THE AUDIENCE AT 
THE CRUCIBLE HE IS CUEING 
AWKWARDLY ON A RED BUT HE IS FIFTY SEVEN IN 
FRONT WITH FIFTY ONE LEFT ON THE TABLE THAT IS JUST ABOUT IT NOW 
CAST YOUR MIND BACK TWELVE MONTHS ALI 
CARTER BEASTS BUT IT DISAPPOINTED 
BUT HE LOST IN THE QUARTER FINALS 
PETER REED DISAPPOINTED 
HE WILL BE DELIGHTED TO HAVE 
REACHED HIS FIRST EVER SEMI FINAL 
HERE 
BARRING A NUMBER OF SNOOKERS 
CARTER IS THROUGH 
A FEW MOMENTS 
THERE IS ALI CARTER ON HIS 
LATER THERE IS ALI CARTER ON HIS WAY TO THE SEMI FINALS HIS SIXTH 
VISIT TO THE CRUCIBLE IN THE SEMI 
FINALS THIS YEAR ON THE BACK OF 
HITTING THE SECOND ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN OF THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP THE WORLD NUMBER FOURTEEN 
INTO SINGLE FIGURES NOW I FANCY 
HE HAS JOINED US VERY KINDLY 
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN BUT MORE 
IMPORTANT TO GET INTO THE SEMI 
FINALS HOW DID YOU SLEEP LAST 
NIGHT 
I DID NOT SLEEP THAT WELL NIGHT IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO COME DOWN 
FROM THE CEILING BUT I KNEW I HAD A 
JOB TO DO TODAY TO WIN THE MATCH 
AND IF I HADN'T WON IT WOULD HAVE 
TAKEN THE SHINE OF THE MAXIMUM BUT 
NOW I AM THROUGH TO THE SEMI FINALS 
IT HIGHLIGHTS IT MORE 
WE KNOW YOU 
HAVE BEEN TAKING YOUR PILOT'S 
LICENCE AND ARE HALFWAY ALONG WHAT 
WILL BE THE HARDEST TO LAND I A 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN OR A SEVEN FORTY SEVEN YOUR HEART MUST HAVE 
BEEN BUZZING 
THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN WAS 
DEFINITELY A LITTLE BIT MORE 
DIFFICULT NOT THAT I HAVE FLOWN 
SEVEN FORTY SEVEN I MIGHT GET TO DO BOTH ONE DAY 
YOU JOKED ABOUT GETTING A 
CONVERTIBLE IN REFERENCE TO 
RONNIE'S STORY WHAT CONVERTIBLE 
ARE YOU AFTER 
DEFAULT FOCUS IF IF SURELY YOU WILL BE AFTER AN OPEN 
TOP VERSION 
A FORD FOCUS MY 
GARAGE ISN'T QUITE BIG ENOUGH FOR 
AN OPEN TOP 
YOU NEED IT BIGGER 
GARAGE TO GET THE WINGS IN GREAT 
ABOUT THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN BUT HAD HAD YOU 
COME BACK AND NOT CAPITALISED THIS 
MORNING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
SICKENING 
YES L. HAD A RESULT LAST SICKENING NIGHT GETTING NINETY SEVEN IN FRONT I WAS 
AWARE I WAS SHAKING LIKE A LEAF 
NINETY SEVEN I THOUGHT IT WAS A CLEAN BILL 
OF HEALTH TO CAPITALISE ON THAT NINETY SEVEN 
TODAY I WAS PLEASED 
LET'S HEAR THE 
REACTION OF PETER EBDON 
WE CAN'T HEAR FROM PETER EBDON AT 
THE MOMENT LET'S HEAR LATER I I KNOW THE REACTION FROM ALI CARTER 
LAST YEAR HE WAS DISAPPOINTED TO 
GET KNOCKED OUT CLOSE AGAINST SELBY 
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE ONE TABLE 
SET UP ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO 
IT 
YES I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED IT IT BEFORE WE HAD BEEN TO THE 
MASTERS BUT IT IS IF THE BID 
DIFFERENT TO BE HERE IN THE SEMI 
FINALS A DREAM COME TRUE HOW HOW WOULD YOU SPEND THE REST OF THE DAY 
AND COMPARE AFTER THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN AND 
WINNING THROUGH TO THE LAST FOUR

FORESEE THE ROUND UP WHO WILL 
PLAY HER 
IF I WILL BE DOING THE SECOND 
SESSION OF RONNIE O'SULLIVAN AND 
LIANG WENBO 
A LOT OF PEOPLE 
THOUGHT THAT DRAMATIC GAME AGAINST 
JOE SWAIL MAY HAVE BEEN ENDING ON A 
LOW AND NOT A HIGHER BUT HE DONE 
THE BUSINESS RONNIE HAS QUITE A 
BIT TO THINK ABOUT FOUR A PIECE 
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
I WILL BE 
COMMENTATING ON STEPHEN HENDRY 
AGAINST RYAN DAY RYAN DAY MISSED 
THE BOAT LAST NIGHT HE HAD A 
CHANCE TO GET A COUPLE OF FRAMES 
BEHIND BUT STEPHEN HENDRY JUST 
NEEDS TWO FRAMES FOR A PLACE IN THE 
SEMI FINALS 
AND THE FOURTH QUARTER SEMI FINALS FINAL IS BETWEEN SCOTLAND'S STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE AND CANE BE PROFESSIONAL 
JOE PERRY JOE WON THE FIRST FOUR 
STEPHEN THE NEXT FOUR THE COACHING 
TIPS ON PLATFORM ONE COME FROM JOHN 
AND MARK SELBY WE ARE BACK AT THE 
TRAINING STATION NORMALLY KIRSTY 
WARK IS ASKING THE QUESTIONS TODAY 
THE NEWSNIGHT PRESENTER IS 
ANSWERING THEM 
I HAVE PLAYED WITH HENDRY HE GAVE 
ME A LESSON ONCE AM SURE IT WAS 
FROM STIRLING AMONG RIGHT HE GAVE 
ME LESSONS AND IT PAID DIVIDENDS 
AND IT IS GETTING TENSE THE 
MASTERMIND COMPETITION BETWEEN 
PUNDITS PUNDITS A AT WHICH TOURNAMENT WERE YOU 
INVOLVED IN A ROW OVER A FREE BALL 
GRAND PRIX WE SPEAK NOW THOUGH WE 
ARE FRIENDS 
WHAT HE NINETY TWO INCORRECT NINETY TWO INCORRECT NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR 
ARGUING WITH THE REFEREE WHAT TO 
YEAR YEAR YELLOW CARD FOR ARGUING WITH 
MIKHAIL ATTACK MASTERMIND LATER 
HE NOW THE CONCLUDING FRAMES OF THE 
QUARTER FINALS BETWEEN STEPHEN 
HENDRY AND RYAN DAY 
ROY IN CAME OUT FOR THE SECOND 
SESSION KNOWING HE HAD TO PLAY 
ERROR FREE SNOOKER RIGHT IN DAY 
THIS WAS PRECISELY THE WAY NOT TO 
GET PROCEEDINGS UNDER WAY STEPHEN WAS QUICK TO PUNISH HIM 
A BREAK OF SIXTY EIGHT AND THEN HIS SECOND 
FRAME ON THE BOARD 
HE WAS FINALLY BEGINNING TO SHOW 
THE FORM THAT MADE HIM REACH TWO 
FINALS DEFICIT WAS DOWN TO FIVE 
HE MANAGED TO GET HIS THIRD FRAME 
IN A ROW 
THAT HE HAD NO LOVE IN THE THIRTEENTH 
STEPHEN TOOK THE SCENIC ROUTE TO 
THE POCKET WHEN IT IS NOT YOUR DAY 
IS THE PHRASE THAT SPRUNG TO MIND 
MEMORIES OF STEVE DAVIS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE 
FINAL AS STEPHEN MISSED THAT TO 
LEAD RYAN DAY STEEL THE FOURTEENTH 
TO ALLOW A WRY IN DALE TO STEAL 
THE FOURTEENTH 
STEPHEN TOOK THE LAST OF THE 
EVENING WITH A BREAK OF SIXTY EIGHT BRIAN 
KNOWS HE HAS A MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB 
THE TABLE TWO SEES THE SECOND 
SESSION OF THEIR MAGUIRE AND PARIS 
MATCH THE MATCH WE WILL 
CONCENTRATE ON HIS TABLE ONE 
STEPHEN HENDRY SEVEN TIMES WORLD 
CHAMPION AND LEADING OVER THE 
WELSH MAN RYAN DAY FOR A SUBTLE 
AND UNDERSTATED INTRODUCTION HE IS 
ROB ROB GOOD AFTERNOON LADIES AND 
GENTLEMEN SIX DAYS TO GO AT THE 
CRUCIBLE WE STARTED WITH EIGHT WE 
FINISHED WITH FOUR WITHOUT ANY 
FURTHER ADO LET'S GET THE BOYS ON 
THE BAIZE 
INTRODUCING FIRST OF ALL THE 
FORMER EUROPEAN OPEN FINALIST 
BIDDING FOR HIS FIRST CRUCIBLE 
SEMI BEATING GRAEME DOTT IN ROUND 
ONE THE GENTLEMEN JOE PERRY 
AND HIS OPPONENT ONE OF THE NICEST 
GUYS ON THE CIRCUIT TWO THOUSAND FOUR U. K. 
CHAMPION SEMI FINALIST LAST YEAR 
THE PRIDE OF GLASGOW STEPHEN ON 
FIRE MAGUIRE 
ALL THE BEST STEPHEN 
AND ON TABLE ONE A TWO TIME

OUTRAGEOUS THIRTY SIX RANKING EVENT TITLES 
SEVEN TIMES THE CHAMPION HERE 
BIDDING FOR HIS TWELFTH APPEARANCE IN 
THE SEMI FINALS THE UNDISPUTED 
KING OF THE CRUCIBLE STEPHEN 
HENDRY HENDRY 
PRESS THE RED BUTTON T. SEE THE 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE AND JOE PERRY MATCH 
WE WILL STICK WITH THE OTHER MATCH 
GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE ONLY ONCE 
HAS A PLAY AT GONE INTO THE FINAL 
SESSION OF BEST OF TWENTY FIVE LEADING 
ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN AND LOST DON'T THINK STEPHEN 
HENDRY WILL MAKE IT A SECOND 
OCCASION THIS AFTERNOON BUT THE 
PERSON WHO DID WAS MATTHEW STEVENS 
IN LAST YEAR'S QUARTER FINALS HE 
LET HE WAS LEADING SHAUN MURPHY 
ELEVEN TO FIVE AND LOST THIRTEEN TO TWELVE 
I DID THEIR SESSION YESTERDAY 
CLIVE AND THE SCORELINE COULD HAVE 
BEEN A LOT DIFFERENT 
RYAN DAY HAD PLENTY OF CHANCES AND 
HE LET THEM SLIP IF HE HAD HAVE 
POTTED IF YOU LIKE THAT YESTERDAY 
HE WOULD HAVE ONLY BEEN A COUPLE OF 
FRAMES BEHIND BIT UNLUCKY WITH THE 
POSITION THERE 
HENDRY WON THE REMAINING TWO FRAMES 
OF THE EVENING YESTERDAY AND SO IT 
RESUMES SIX IN FRONT 
CATCHING THE GREEN HAS LEFT A 
CHANCE FOR STEPHEN TO TAKE THIS RED 
INTO THE RIGHT CORNER AND HE CAN 
GET ON THE BLACK I THINK IT PASSES 
THE RED NEAR THE LEFT CORNER POCKET 
HE WAS PLAYING FOR THE BLUE BUT IF 
YOU OVERHIT SLIGHTLY YOU WILL 
ALWAYS HAVE BROWN OR YELLOW 
STRAIGHT COULD BE A LITTLE BIT 
AWKWARD 
PERFECT DEEP SCREW ABSOLUTELY 
PERFECT SHAVED PAST THE BLACK 
NO BUT THE PATTERNS OF THE REDS IT 
IS AMAZING LOOK AT THE PATTERNS 
THINK OF THE THOUSANDS UPON 
THOUSANDS OF FRAMES AND THE BALLS 
RARELY FINISH IN THE SAME POSITION 
THAT WAS BIT SHORT OF PACE 
HE HAS LOOKED LIKE THE OLD STEPHEN 
HENDRY IN AMONGST THE BALLS CLIVE 
THIS YEAR 
INDEED HE HAS NOT MANY 
PEOPLE EXPECTED HENDRY TO BE SUCH A 
STRONG TITLE CONTENDER ON THE 
STRENGTH OF A COUPLE OF 
DISAPPOINTING SEASONS ONLY ONE 
SEMI FINAL TO HIS NAME ON THE 
CIRCUIT SO FAR THIS SEASON BUT 
LIKE ALL ALL TIME GREATS IN EVERY 
SPORT THERE IS SOME SPECIAL 
QUALITY INSIDE HIM IF ONLY HE CAN 
ACCESS IT 
I THINK IT ALL STARTED AGAINST 
YOUNG MARK ALLEN WHO PLAYED 
TERRIFICALLY WELL AGAINST HIM BUT 
THE LAST THREE FRAMES IT WAS 
VINTAGE STEPHEN HENDRY 
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS IN 
PARTICULAR THAT REMINDED ME OF THE 
OLD HENDRY A NICE AND COOL 
CLEARANCE 
AND A SEVENTY TWO BREAK TO TAKE THE DECIDER 
IN ONE VISIT JUST LIKE OLD TIMES 
APART FROM THE POTTING THERE HAS 
BEEN A NOTICEABLE IMPROVEMENT IN 
HENDRY'S SAFETY AND TACTICAL GAME 
I THINK IT IS IN BETTER SHAPE THAN 
IT HAS EVER BEEN 
AND NOT PUSHING THE BOAT OUT AS WE 
CALL IT 
GIVE HIM HALF A CHANCE HE WILL 
STILL GO FOR IT BUT HE IS PLAYING 
THE PERCENTAGES 
HE HAS MISSED A FEW OF THESE BUT IN 
AMONGST THE BALLS HE HAS BEEN 
SUPERB IT HAS BEEN THIS TYPE OF 
SHOT THAT HE HAS MISSED 
A SURPRISING AND FOR HIM 
DISAPPOINTING MISS HE GOT THE 
WRONG SIDE OF THE BLUE AND HAD TO 
LEAVE THAT 
HE WILL BE FLYING THE FLAG FOR 
WALES NEXT SEASON CLIVE 
HE WILL 
BE THE STANDARD BEARER 
BUT MARK WILLIAMS HAS SHOWN A 
WELCOME RETURN TO FORM ALSO 
HE MEANT TO CANNON IT THE OTHER 
SIDE GOOD RECOVERY THERE 
THE CLOTHS HAVE BEEN PLAYING 
BEAUTIFULLY SINCE THEY WERE 
RECOVERED BUT THEY ARE SO LIVELY 
AND LIGHT IF YOU DON'T STRIKE THE 
CUE BALL CORRECTLY THAT TYPE OF 
THING CAN HAPPEN 
THAT IS THE DOWNSIDE THE UPSIDE 
IS THAT THE CLOTH WHICH IS ALSO 
FAST RUNNING IS VERY RESPONSIVE 
VERY THIN CUT THE POCKET WAS OUT 
OF VISION AS HE PLAYED THE SHOT 
THIS IS A TESTER FOR RYAN DAY I AM 
NOT SURE HE CAN GET THROUGH TO THE 
ONE THAT IS SLIGHTLY CLOSER TO THE 
POCKET BUT THE OTHER ONE 
DEFINITELY POTS WELL PLAYED TERRIFIC SHOT THERE 
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE MISSED THAT AT 
POINT BLANK RANGE MAYBE HE WAS 
WORRYING ABOUT CANNONING THE BLACK 
HE WANTED TO GET THE CUE BALL ABOVE 
THE BLACK 
HE NEEDS TO BELIEVE A GOOD ANGLE ON 
THIS LAST RED HE NEEDS TO LEAVE 
THAT IS ABOUT PERFECT HE DOESN'T 
HAVE TO FORCE IT NOW IT GIVES THE 
POCKET MORE OF CHANCE OF ACCEPTING THE RED 
HENDRY HAS MADE SURE OF ANOTHER 
FRAME RYAN DAY HAD A COUPLE OF 
CHANCES BUT DIDN'T TAKE FULL 
ADVANTAGE OF THEM 
QUITE A FEW OF THE FRAMES HAVE GONE 
THIS WAY WHERE RYAN DAY HAS BEEN 
OF THE CHANCES AND HASN'T 
CAPITALISED 
EVEN WITH THE KICK HE POTTED THE 
BLUE 
THAT HAS INCREASED HIS LEAD TO TWELVE TO FIVE 
HE IS WITHIN ONE OF A PLACE IN THE 
SEMI FINALS HENDRY GAINED CONTROL 
OF THAT FRAME WITH A BREAK OF FORTY EIGHT 
IN WHICH THE FIRST SHOT WAS KEY 
HE WAS DEAD STRAIGHT ON THIS RED 
HE WANTED AN ANGLE FOR THE BLACK 
WE ARE GOING TO SHOW YOU WHERE HE 
MADE CONTACT WITH THE CUE BALL TO 
SCREW BACK IN A STRAIGHT LINE TO 
STOP HE IS HITTING THE WHITE WHAT 
WE CALL SIX O'CLOCK TO CREATE 
MAXIMUM BACKSPIN HE COULDN'T HAVE 
PLAYED IT ANY BETTER THAT IS WHAT 
HE IS LOOKING AT YOU WOULD THINK 
HE COULD FORCE IT OUT THERE BUT HE 
PLAYED THE SCREW BACK HE CUED IT 
SO WELL CLIVE DIDN'T HE YES YES JUST SHAVED THE CUE BALL INSIDE THE 
BLACK AND LEFT HIMSELF PERFECT 
POSITION SO HENDRY NEEDS ONLY ONE 
OF A POSSIBLE REMAINING EIGHT 
FRAMES TO GO THROUGH TO THE SEMIS 
THAT IS USUALLY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN 
YOU ARE CUEING WELL YOU GET A 
LITTLE FLICK ON THE GREEN AND LEAVE 
IT AWKWARD THERE IS JUST A GAP 
BETWEEN BLUE AND PINK TO CLIP THE 
REDS HE PLAYED IT WELL A VERY 
GOOD SAFETY SHOT FROM RYAN 
HENDRY TAP TO THE TABLE IN 
APPRECIATION 
HE CAUGHT IT THIN AND THAT IS WHY 
HE CANNONED THE BLACK BUT HE HAS 
KNOCKED IT SAFE THAT IS ANOTHER 
PET HATE OF THE SNOOKER PLAYER 
KNOCKING THE BLACKS SAFE EARLY ON 
OF SNOOKER PLAYER 
BECAUSE THE 
CUE BALL HAS FINISHED ON TO THE 
SIDE CUSHION DAY IS A LITTLE 
RESTRICTED POSITIONALLY 
THAT POT WAS NOT A FORMALITY WHY WHY IN NOW IS JUST GOING TO PLAY FOR 
BIT OF PRIDE RYAN IS GOING TO 
PLAY FOR A BIT OF PRIDE WE ALL 
KNOW WHAT GREAT PLAYER HE IS 
YOU DON'T GET INTO THE TOP EIGHT 
WITHOUT BEING A VERY CAPABLE BREAK 
BUILDER 
DAY RUNNER UP IN LAST BUILDER SEASON'S MALTA CUP AND ALSO THE 
SHANGHAI MASTERS AT THE START OF 
THIS SEASON 
BUT YOU NEED A GOOD RUN AT THE 
CRUCIBLE TO MAKE YOUR NAME WITH THE 
GENERAL PUBLIC TO SOME EXTENT HE 
HAS DONE THAT HE BEAT JOHN HIGGINS 
THE DEFENDING CHAMPION 
HE WAS GOING TO TAKE THE POT ON 
BUT HE CHANGED HIS MIND 
HE CHANGED HIS MIND BECAUSE HE 
WOULD HAVE CANNONED ANOTHER RED 
COMING UP TO FIVE HOURS FOR SEVENTEEN 
COMPLETED FRAMES 
WHEN YOU GET TO THIS STAGE IN THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS YOU WANT TO 
WIN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND GET 
YOURSELF READY FOR THE SEMI FINAL 
BECAUSE MENTALLY IT TAKES QUITE 
BIT OUT OF YOU IT IS A LONG HAUL 
SEVENTEEN DAYS 
BUT HE IS FAIRLY FOCUSED AND WHEN 
YOU THINK OF WHAT RYAN DAY DID TO 
JOHN HIGGINS AS YOU MENTIONED A 
LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING 
TO DO THE SAME TO STEPHEN HENDRY BUT STEPHEN HENDRY HAD OTHER IDEAS 
COULDN'T GET SAFE SO THAT WAS A 
SORT OF HOLDING SHOT JUST TRY AND 
POT THE RED TO GIVE HIMSELF THE 
NEXT SHOT 
WELL STEPHEN WAS HOPING TO PUSH 
THE BLACK INTO A POTTABLE POSITION 
IT IS TIED UP NOW ON THE SIDE 
CUSHION A GOOD RED FROM DAY 
I CAN'T REALLY COME OFF THE LEFT 
SIDE CUSHION AND LAND ON THIS RED 
NEAR THE CORNER POCKET HE WOULD 
LEAVE THE OTHER RED TO THE RIGHT OF 
THAT THAT IS WHY HE IS HAVING TO 
GIVE THIS LITTLE BIT OF THOUGHT 
IN FACT HE CAN'T SEE AN EASY RED 
TO LAND ON HERE I CAN'T SEE HE PLAYED IT WELL 
THERE IS STILL A POT ON TO THE 
LEFT CORNER 
PERFECTION FOUR STEPHEN WOULD HAVE 
BEEN LEAVING THE CUE BALL BETWEEN 
THE RED AND THE SIDE CUSHION FOR 
STEPHEN 
A BIT OF A CHANCE HERE TO LEAVE 
HIMSELF ON THE PINK 
OH UNLUCKY IT WAS A BIT RISKY 
BUT NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CHOICE 
OF SHOT HE DID HE JUST DIDN'T 
GET THE CANNON ON THE OTHER RED AS 
HE INTENDED 
GOOD RECOVERY POT 
AND NOW A 
LITTLE CHANCE TO SEE THE CUE ACTION 
THAT WAS CUED PERFECTLY WATCH THE 
ACTION HE GETS ON THE CUE BALL HERE 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT KICK HE 
DIDN'T SEEM TO GET ENOUGH SCREW ON 
THAT AT ALL YES HE IS HAVING THE 
BALL CLEANED THE RED JUMPED MILE 
DEVELOPING MORE REDS 
THAT IS A 
USEFUL ONE GOING OVER THE LEFT 
CORNER HE CAN JUST DROP THE BLUE 
IN NOW IF HE WANTS 
THIS BLUE LOOKS TO BE ABSOLUTELY 
DEAD STRAIGHT 
STEPHEN PRACTICE IS THAT SORT OF 
SHOT A LOT HE HAS HELD THE SPOT 
SO THE BLUE WILL HAVE TO COME UP 
ONTO THE BLACK SPOT NO JUST 
ENOUGH ROOM ON ITS OWN SPOT 
THERE IS NO WAY HE WANTED TO HOLD 
THE SPOT HE DIDN'T WANT THE BLUE 
ON THE BLACK SPOT 
SO BLACK OUT OF 
PLAY AT THE MOMENT PINK ALSO 
BUT BY PLAYING FOR THAT RED HE 
WILL BRING THE PINK INTO PLAY 
THIS IS A VERY GOOD CHANCE FOR 
STEPHEN HENDRY THERE ARE ONLY A 
COUPLE OF REDS SAFE REALLY 
I AM JUST THINKING CLYDE THE ODDS 
ON STEPHEN HENDRY BEFORE THIS YEAR 
CLOSE UP EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT C. O. M. WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 
STARTED WERE THIRTY THREE TO ONE 
IT IS THIRTY EIGHT MONTHS SINCE HE HAS WON A 
TOURNAMENT OF ANY KIND HE HAS 
REACHED ONLY ONE SEMI FINAL THIS 
SEASON SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HIM 
NOT BEING AMONG THE FAVOURITES 
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT THERE 
IN THE CROWD BUT YES THE SNOOKER 
PUNDITS KNOW THAT IF HE COULD HAVE 
GOTTEN A WIN UNDER HIS BELT WHICH 
HE DID DO THERE IS NO REASON WHY 
HE CAN'T WIN AND EIGHTH WORLD TITLE 
AN EIGHTH 
HE HAS CERTAINLY NEVER LOST 
FAITH IN HIS OWN ABILITY OR RELAXED 
HIS COMMITMENT TO PRACTISE ALL STOP 
TO PRACTICE 
POSSIBLY WE CAN DRAW SOME SORT OF 
PARALLEL WITH JACK NICKLAUS 
EVERYBODY THOUGHT HE WAS FINISHED 
WITH WINNING GOLF MAJORS WHEN HE 
WAS FORTY BUT AT THE AGE OF FORTY SIX HE 
WON THE MASTERS AT AUGUSTA 
THERE IS JUST SOMETHING SPECIAL 
INSIDE THE ALL TIME GREATS BUT 
SOMETIMES THEY CAN'T QUITE BRING IT 
OUT 
HE HAS FINISHED STRAIGHT ON THE 
PINK IF HE HOLDS THE SPOT IT IS 
NOT A BAD CHOICE THE PINK WOULD BE 
ON THE BLACK SPOT THAT IS WHAT HE 
WAS THINKING OF DOING HE IS 
PLAYING THAT AS IF IT WAS THE WHITE 
JUST REMEMBER TO GO BACK AND STRIKE 
THE CUE BALL STEVE DON'T POT THAT 
BEFORE YOU POT THE PINK 
RYAN WAS A BIT UCKY HE WAS 
PLAYING SCREW BACK AND GOT 
TERRIBLE CONTACT WHICH KILLED 
EVERYTHING 
IF HE HADN'T HAD A KICK HAWKEYE 
SHOWS YOU HE WOULD HAVE SCREWED 
BACK AND BE NICELY ON THE BLUE 
MEANWHILE STEPHEN HENDRY IS HAVING 
THE CUE BALL CLEANED RYAN IS 
SITTING THERE WONDERING IF HE IS 
GOING TO GET BACK TO THE TABLE IN 
THIS YEAR'S WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP NO 
HE MAY HAVE COVERED IT BUT I THINK 
RYAN CAN SENT THE OTHER RED TO THE 
LEFT OF THE PINK ON TO IT OR PLAY 
IT OFF THE CUSHION CAN SEND 
WELL JUST LOOKING AT IT HE IS NOW 
LOOKING AT SENDING THE RED ALONG 
HE WOULD HAVE TO AIM THE FIRST RED 
JUST TO THE LEFT OF THE POCKET TO 
KNOCK IT IN HE COULD DOUBLE KISS 
THIS AND IT MIGHT STAY OUT NO HE DIDN'T GET THE DOUBLE KISS HENDRY IS EYEING UP A PLANT 
THAT WAS NOT GUARANTEED DIDN'T GET 
THE PLANT AND HE MOVED THE PINK NOT AN EASY ONE TO ASSESS 
A GOOD POT AND HE HAS DEVELOPED 
THE BLACK 
ANOTHER GOOD SHOT CERTAINLY IN 
INTENTION HE CANNONED ANOTHER RED 
INTO A POTTABLE POSITION 
BUT WHEN 
THINGS ARE GOING WELL FOR YOU YOU 
ALWAYS GET A NICE LITTLE CARYS 
THIS IS A BIT AWKWARD NOW NICE 
LITTLE KIDS KISS WELL PLAYED 
IT WAS A BIT AWKWARD IT IS NOT STRAIGHT FORWARD YET PAUL 
RYAN BECAUSE THE BLACK DOES NOT 
PASS THE PINK FOUR RYAN HE HAS TO 
TRY AND GET THE WHITE IN THE 
POSITION WHERE HE DOES NOT SNOOKER 
HIMSELF 
SO RYAN IS NOT QUITE READY TO HEAD 
BACK TO SOUTH WALES HE WANTS TO 
STAY IN SHEFFIELD FOR A LITTLE BIT 
LONGER 
YES THE DELIGHTS OF SOUTH WALES 
WERE HAVE TO WAIT WHILE 
MIND YOU 
IF THAT BLACK HAD STAYED OUT IT 
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LONG 
OH THAT HAS GOT A BIG BOUNCE OFF 
THE CUSHION A VERY QUICK BOUNCE 
INDEED IT HAS MADE THIS AWKWARD 
NOW WELL PLAYED 
IT WILL BE A NEW CLOTHS AND YOU 
CUSHION CLOTH FOR THE SEMI FINALS 
TOMORROW A NEW CLOTH THE NEW 
CUSHION CLOTH 
THAT WAS FRAME BALL RYAN DAY TAKES 
THE FRAME BUT STEPHEN HENDRY IS 
STILL WITHIN FRAME OF PLACE IN 
THE SEMI FINALS WITH TWELVE TO SIX LEAD 
RYAN IS A DETERMINED CHARACTER 
ALTHOUGH IT WOULD APPEAR THAT 
STEPHEN HENDRY WOULD WIN THIS MATCH 
RYAN WILL NOT LET HIM DO IT EASILY 
NO HE IS AN EXCELLENT PLAYER AT 
THE START OF THE SEASON MARK 
WILLIAMS SAID HE WAS DUE TO WIN ONE 
PERHAPS HE JUST 
YOU'D 
FINISHING TOUCHES TO PUT TO HIS 
GAME BUT I'M NOT SURE IN WHICH 
DEPARTMENT HE HAD GREAT WIN 
AGAINST JOHN HIGGINS TURNING ROUND 
A FOUR TO ZERO DEFICIT HE GOT OFF TO A BAD 
START AGAINST STEPHEN HENDRY AND IT 
LOOKS LIKE HE WILL NOT RECOVER FROM 
IT SOMEWHERE DOWN THE LINE HE IS 
GOING TO JUMP UP LEVEL AND START 
WINNING EVENTS NOT JUST 
THREATENING TO DO SO 
AS FAR AS 
STEPHEN IS CONCERNED THIS IS HIS 
EIGHTY FIRST MATCH IN THE CRUCIBLE YOU ARE 
ONLY A COUPLE BEHIND HIM STEPHEN STEPHEN HENDRY LOOKS LIKE THE STEPHEN 
HENDRY OF OLD HIS GAME SEEMS IN 
MUCH BETTER NICK GENERALLY HE 
SEEMS MORE FOCUSED OBVIOUSLY IT 
IS EASIER TO BE FOCUSED WHEN YOU 
ARE KNOCKING THE BALLS IN WHEN YOU 
A 
PLAYER WHO HAS JUST MISSED A 
SHOT SITTING IN HIS CHAIR IT IS 
EASY TO SAY HE HAS LOST FOCUS AT 
THE MOMENT HE SEEMS VERY 
DETERMINED KEEPING HIS MIND ON THE 
JOB ONE BALL AT A TIME ONE FRAME 
AT THE TIME THINGS ARE WORKING OUT 
NICELY FOR HIM IN THIS TOURNAMENT 
BACK TO CLIVE AND DENNIS 
STEPHEN HENDRY IS CONTESTING A 
RECORD SEVENTEENTH QUARTER FINAL HERE 
STEVE DAVIS APPEARED IN FIFTEEN JIMMY 
WHITE IN FOURTEEN 
JUST A CONTAINING SAFETY THERE 
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN WE MENTIONED 
THAT IS THE DUMP SHOT INTRODUCED 
BY CLIFF THORBURN WHERE YOU LEAVE 
THE WHITE UP THIS END AND DUMP THE 
RED UP THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE 
QUITE A FEW PLAYERS ARE PLAYING THE 
CLIFF THORBURN DUMP SHOT THESE DAYS 
CLIVE 
IT HAS BECOME ONE OF THE CLIVE STANDARD SHOTS AS HAS THE GLANCING 
ESCAPE WHICH CLIFF THORBURN IF 
NOT INTRODUCED CERTAINLY 
POPULARISED L. THINK HE WAS THE 
FIRST TO REALLY APPRECIATE ITS 
POSSIBILITIES 
AND ALSO YOU HAVE POSSIBILITIES GOT TO GIVE IT TO THE CANADIANS 
PLANTS AND THAT THE BRITISH 
PROFESSIONALS WERE NEVER ALWAYS 
LOOKING FOR PLANTS THEN THE 
COMEDIANS CAME ON THE SCENE AND 
THEY WERE PICKING PLANTS OUT OF THE 
PACK THAT WE NEVER THOUGHT OF 
LOOKING FOR THE CANADIANS L. 
THINK HE MISCUED THERE DID HE YES 
I THINK HE POSSIBLY DID 
YES THAT WAS A MISCUE WE DON'T 
SEE IT THAT OFTEN BUT THE 
CAMERAMAN CAPTURED THAT ONE HE SPOTTED HIM TOPPING IT 
TO TAKE UP YOUR POINT ABOUT THE 
CANADIANS IT IS VERY SAD THAT 
SNOOKER SEEMS TO HAVE LOST OUT TO 
PULL POOL AS POPULAR SPORT IN 
CANADA THERE ARE NO OUTSTANDING UP 
AND COMING CANADIAN SNOOKER PLAYERS 
TO BE FAIR I THINK WE LET IT SLIP 
IN THE MID EIGHTIES WE USED TO TRAVEL 
THERE TO THE T. V. STATION THE TOP 
EIGHT PLAYERS IN THE WORLD KIRK 
STEVENS AND CLIFF THORBURN THE 
PLAYERS WERE BECOMING HOUSEHOLD 
NAMES IN CANADA AND THEN SUDDENLY 
THEY TOOK A WORLD RANKING EVENT 
WITH SIXTY ODD PLAYERS AND THE 
INTEREST SEEMED TO WANE 
AS HENDRY 
CONTINUES TO STUDY I CAN SUPPLY 
THE REASON THE TOURNAMENT WAS 
STAGED OUT OF TOWN FROM TORONTO IN 
THE HUGE AUDITORIUM THERE WERE 
HUGE BANKS OF RED SEATS AND HARDLY 
ANY SPECTATORS C. B. C. THE HOST 
BROADCASTERS SAID WELL THAT IS 
ENOUGH OF THAT I THINK 
THAT IS 
EXACTLY WHAT I'M SAYING KEEP IT 
GOING FOR A FEW MORE YEARS IN THE 
STUDIO WHERE WE USED TO GET THREE HUNDRED 
PEOPLE THERE L. PLAYED STEVE DAVIS 
IN THE FINAL OF THE CANADIAN 
MASTERS JIMMY WHITE AND THE 
INTEREST WAS FANTASTIC 
ALL THAT DALY CAN DO IS JUST GIVE 
OFF HIS BEST IN EACH FRAME UNTIL HE 
LOSES THE LOSING FRAME DAY 
WHAT HE IS THINKING ABOUT NOW IS 
I'D LOVE TO GET PAST THE MID 
SESSION INTERVAL AND INTO THE VERY 
LAST SESSION BUT YOU CAN ONLY PLAY 
ONE FRAME AT THE TIME 
BUT THE RECENT YOU ARE ALWAYS IN A 
GLIMMER IN WITH A GLIMMER OF HOPE 
IS THAT ONLY ONE PLAYER CAN PLAY AT 
THE TIME AT HER TIME IF YOU POT 
THE BALLS THE OTHER FELLOW WILL 
BEAT SITTING AND WATCHING AT A 
TIME WILL BE SITTING AND 
WATCHING 
RYAN DAY'S HIGHEST BREAK IN THIS 
MATCH HAS BEEN SIXTY EIGHT 
YES HE HAS NOT PRODUCED HIS BEST 
ON A CONSISTENT BASIS 
BUT THESE ARE GOOD TIMES FOR THE 
DAILY POLITICS FAMILY TWENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD 
RYAN IS DOING WELL DASH FOR DAY 
FAMILY 
RYAN HAS BEEN PROFESSIONAL SINCE 
NINETEEN NINETY NINE HE HAS MADE ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN CENTURIES IN 
HIS CAREER HE IS A TERRIFIC BREAK 
BUILDER THE KISS WAS PERFECT 
PLAYED THAT REALLY WELL FOUND THE 
GAP WITH THE TWO REDS JUDGED TO 
PERFECTION 
YOU GOT A GOOD SHOT OF THE DOMED 
TIP OF RYAN DAY'S CUE YOU HAVE GOT 
TO SAND IT OFF WHILE IT DID IT 
DENIES TIP ON IT THAT HELPS YOU TO 
SCREW BACK SAND IT OFF WHILE IT 
TO GET A NICE TIP ON IT OR FILE 
IT 
THESE CUES ARE WELL MADE THESE DAYS 
NOT LIKE THE WHEN HE PRESENTED TO 
ME IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT WHEN I WON THE BRITISH 
JUNIOR BILLIARDS TOURNAMENT IT 
A METAL THING 
WELL THEY WERE THE 
SPONSORS THEY WERE TRYING TO GET 
THEM NEPAL CUE TUBULAR METAL 
WIDELY ACCEPTED THE THEM METAL 
CUE THEIR METTLE CUE BUT AS 
FRED DAVIS ONCE SAID ABOUT THEM 
THEY ARE GREAT FOR POKING THE FIRE 
WITH 
TALKING OF FRED DAVIS COMMIT WITH HIS DAUGHTER YESTERDAY ALISON 
WHAT A CHARMING LADY SHE IS I 
MET HIS DAUGHTER L. HAD A NICE CHAT 
WITH HER AND TOLD HER HOW MUCH I 
ENJOYED THE COMPANY OF HER FATHER 
AND HOW HE HELPED ME IN MY EARLY 
CAREER THE FIRST TIME I MET HIM 
IT WAS ON POT BLACK L. HELD THE 
DOOR OPEN FOR HIM AND HE CHATTED TO 
ME FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES HE WAS A 
MARVELLOUS MAN 
NOT TO TERRIBLE BECAUSE THE SEVENTY ONE HAS 
LEFT HENDRY NEEDING A SNOOKER TO 
TIE 
JUST A BIT CLOSE TO THE CUSHION 
WITH THE CUE BALL THAT HASN'T WORKED OUT 
HE JUST PLAYED THE SAFETY SHOT SO 
HE STILL FEELS HENDRY HAD THE 
CHANCE IN THIS FRAME 
HENDRY IS DEFINITELY MORE 
INTERESTED IN THE TACTICAL SIDE OF 
THE GAME THEN HE USED TO BE HE WON 
A VITAL FRAME IN THE OPENING MATCH 
HERE AND HE NEEDED TWO SNOOKER'S 
AND IN THE HALL OF HIS CAREER I 
CAN NEVER REMEMBER HIM DOING THAT 
IN THE WHOLE OF HIS CAREER 
DO YOU REMEMBER IN THE OLD DAYS 
THEY USED TO SAY HIT IT WHERE IT 
SHINES WHEN THEY HAD THE BULBS 
NOT A GREAT COACHING GUIDE 
HE HAS WON TWO OF THE FIRST THREE 
FRAMES THIS AFTERNOON 
THE OTHER NIGHT WE SAW WHAT JOE 
SWAIL DID AGAINST THE YOUNG CHINESE 
SENSATION THE LIANG WENBO 
SO NEVER SAY NEVER 
I THINK YOU CAN 
SAY ALMOST NEVER HENDRY STILL 
LEADS 
THE BIGGEST INFLUENCE IN MY CAREER 
WILL BE MY DAD HE STARTED ME OFF 
AND HE WAS TAKING ME EVERYWHERE AS 
A JUNIOR PLAYER AND KEEPS ON 
PUSHING THE AND INSPIRER NEED TO 
GET BETTER AND BETTER INSPIRING 
ME MY FAVOURITE PLAYER WAS 
PROBABLY JIMMY WHITE JUST THE WAY 
HE PLAYED HE WAS THE PEOPLE'S 
FAVOURITE AND HE WAS CERTAINLY MIND 
THE FIRST DECENT CHEQUE I RECEIVED 
WAS WHEN I WON THE BENSON AND AMP HEDGES 
QUALIFYING TOURNAMENT L. L. THINK I 
BOUGHT THE DEPOSIT FOR MY HOUSE 
WITH THAT 
STILL GOT A LONG WAY TO GO 
HOPEFULLY I AM REMEMBERED FOR THE 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS THAT THEY END 
UP WINNING THAT I END UP 
HOW HAS RYAN DAY TOLD HIMSELF HE 
CAN WIN THIS MATCH HE WANTS TO 
BELIEVE IT BUT HOW CAN YOU CONVINCE 
YOURSELF 
I DON'T THINK IN THIS YOURSELF SITUATION YOU DO SAY THAT YOU SAY 
O. K. JUST TAKE IT STEADY SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS BE OPTIMISTIC AND PLAY AND 
SEE IF THE OTHER GUY STARTS TO 
FAULT THE UNLIKELY HAD FOR RYAN 
DAY IS THAT STEPHEN HENDRY IS NOT 
THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO WASTES TOO 
MANY CHANCES AMONG THE BALLS AND AT 
SOME STAGE HE WILL GET A FRAME 
WINNING OPPORTUNITY AND HE HAS A 
VERY HIGH CONVERSION RATE 
BACK TO 
CLIVE AND DENNIS LET'S SEE PERFECT 
AND STEVE DAVIS AS HE SAID 
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE HE WILL 
GET A CHANCE IN THE BALLS AND HE 
GOT THAT IMMEDIATELY IN THIS FRAME 
WITH THAT TERRIFIC LONG POT 
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT STEPHEN 
HENDRY IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO GET OFF 
TO A GOOD START IN THE OPENING 
FRAME CLIVE AND ALWAYS SEEMED TO 
FINISH IN STYLE AS WELL AS STEVE 
DAVIS DID THROUGHOUT THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
TALKING ABOUT USING FROM IN FRONT 
I REMEMBER THE MASTERS FINAL AT 
WEMBLEY LOSING IT WAS THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES 
STEPHEN HENDRY WAS LOSING EIGHT ONE 
AND THEN WON IT NINE TO EIGHT 
IF MIKE CATT 
WON HE MIGHT HAVE STILL BEEN 
PLAYING AT QUITE A HIGH STANDARD 
IT REALLY SET HIM BACK IF MIKE 
HAVE WON YOU GAIN THE CONFIDENCE 
TO GO ON AND WIN MORE 
YES MIKE'S HOUSE WAS BURGLED THAT 
NIGHT AS WELL SO NOT THE BEST DAYS 
HE DID NOT JUDGE THE CANNON AS HE 
INTENDED 
IS THERE ONE AVAILABLE IN THE LEFT 
CORNER IT LOOKS VERY TIGHT TO ME 
HE STOPS IN HIS TRACKS HE IS NOT 
ON THE RED HE DID NOT NEED TO GO 
CRASHING INTO THEM THERE HE NEEDED 
THE WHITE TO RUN THROUGH ANOTHER 
INCH 
HE HAS GOT A STRAIGHT FORWARD THIN 
LITTLE SAFETY 
THINNER THAN INTENDED SO NO 
PRESSURE ON HENDRY'S NEXT SHOT 
ONE RED MUST BE BLOCKING THE OTHER 
YOU CAN SEE 
HE PLAYED WITH A TOUCH OF SWERVE 
BUT HE LEFT THE RED AND LOOK WHERE 
THE BLACK HAS GONE IN AMONGST THE 
BUNCH OF REDS 
HE HAS GONE A BIT CLOSER TO THE 
BLUE THAN HE WANTED THERE IS ONE 
RED AVAILABLE BY ONE AWAY FROM THE 
BUNCH THE ONE AWAY 
IS HE HARD ENOUGH IT DEPENDS 
THE ONE TO THE RIGHT OF THE BLACK 
MIGHT ALSO POT SO HE HAD A MARGIN 
FOR ERROR JUST ABOUT POTS 
IT SPAN THE CUE BALL OFF THE SIDE 
CUSHION 
AND NOW A CHANCE TO OPEN THE PINK 
BLACK AND THE REDS UP 
THIS WILL DECIDE THE OUTCOME OF 
THIS MATCH YOU WOULD FEEL HE IS STUCK ON THEM SURELY THERE IS NOT 
IS A 
PLANT THERE IS THERE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT'S AMAZING THAT IS AMAZING HOW HE HAS FOUND ONE THERE A LITTLE BIT CLOSE TO THE CUSHION WITHIN TWO OR THREE POTS OF VICTORY HE HAS GOT A FREE SHOT HERE HE HAD 
NO SIDE 
IF STEPHEN WALLS 
THIS RED AND THE MIDDLE POCKET IT 
IS THE END OF THE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP FOR RYAN DAY IF 
STEPHEN ROLLS THIS RED IN THE 
MIDDLE POCKET 
RYAN DAY IT NOW KNOWS IT IS ALL 
OVER 
STEPHEN HENDRY IS POSSIBLY PLAYING 
RONNIE O'SULLIVAN WHAT A SEMI 
FINAL 
CERTAINLY A HISTORY OF MANY FINAL HENDRY AND O'SULLIVAN MATCHES 
AND NOW THAT HENDRY HAS POTTED THAT 
RED WE CAN SAY WITH CONFIDENCE 
THAT HE HAS PASSED THE POST 
I AM DELIGHTED FOR STEPHEN HENDRY 
BECAUSE LOT OF PEOPLE HAD WRITTEN 
HIM OFF THE PUBLIC DON'T SEE HIM 
THAT OFTEN 
HE HAS WORKED HARD AT HIS GAME AND 
HE IS BACK TO NEAR HIS BEST 
THAT SURELY IS IT BUT WHEN IT IS 
THE LOSING FRAME THE LOSER THE 
CERTAIN LOSER I WOULD SAY WANTS 
TO FIGHT IT OUT TO THE LAST 
BUT THAT IS THE LAST HENDRY HAS 
GONE ON TO WIN PRETTY COMFORTABLY 
THIRTEEN TO SEVEN 
IT IS DEFINITELY POSSIBLE THAT 
HENDRY COULD WIN HIS EIGHTH WORLD 
TITLE NINE YEARS AFTER HE WON HIS 
SEVENTH SEVENTH STEPHEN'S TWENTY THIRD CRISTOBAL CAMPAIGN 
HIS TWELFTH SEMI FINAL CRUCIBLE TO TO THINK HE COULD WIN IT NINE YEARS 
AFTER THE LAST THAT WOULD BE A 
PHENOMENAL ACHIEVEMENT IN TODAY'S 
MARKET WITH SO MANY GOOD PLAYERS 
WHAT SURPRISED ME WE WERE TALKING 
ABOUT THE LAST TIME WE SAW HIM WIN 
A MAJOR TITLE OF THE TELEVISION IN 
THE BIG B. B. C. EVENTS NINETY NINE WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIPS AND NOW HE WON THE 
WELSH OPEN A FEW YEARS AGO BUT THAT 
WAS NOT ON NETWORK T. V. IT IS A LONG 
TIME SINCE THE ARMY OF SUPPORTERS 
HAVE SEEN HIM WITH A BIG WIN ALSO ALSO THERE IS A BIT MORE WARMTH WHEN HE 
WALKS OUT A BIT MORE THE UNDERDOG 
THEN HE USED TO BE 
LET'S HEAR FROM 
HIM HIM CONGRATULATIONS INTO YOUR TWELVE 
CRUCIBLE SEMI FINAL 
VERY HAPPY 
VERY HAPPY COMING TO THE CRUCIBLE 
ONE SEMI FINAL I KNEW IF I GOT 
PAST THE FIRST ROUND I KNOW HOW TO 
WIN HERE L. LOVE PLAYING HERE AND 
I'M DELIGHTED 
HOW HAPPY ARE YOU 
WITH YOUR FORM FROM ONE UP TO TEN 
IT WILL HAVE TO IMPROVE IF I WILL 
WIN PERHAPS NOT SCORING AS HEAVY 
AS I WOULD LIKE BUT THERE WERE 
LOT OF KICKS THEY HAVE STOPPED ME 
SCORING HEAVIER THAN I WOULD HAVE 
I AM PRETTY HAPPY OVERALL MY GAME 
IS PRETTY SOLID LAST NIGHT WAS A 
POOR SESSION BUT YOU PLAY SO WHAT 
SNOOKER YOU WILL ALWAYS GOING TO 
BAD SESSIONS IT IS CASE OF 
LIMITING THE DAMAGE 
IS IT A MORE 
CONSIDERED APPROACH THERE SEEMS TO 
BE MORE SAFETY 
THE WAY THE GAME IS 
I HAVE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS HERE 
YOU KNOW A LONG FRAME OF MATCHES 
IF YOU KEEP GOING FOR SILLY SHOTS 
IT WILL COST YOU FRAME AFTER FRAME 
THIS YEAR AS I SAY I HAVE BEEN 
WORKING WITH CHRIS HENDRY AND HE 
HAS GOT ME TO PLAY A BIT MORE 
SAFETY WHICH I STILL THINK 
SAFETY IS OVERRATED BUT I WON'T 
COMPLAIN 
POSSIBLY EVEN RONNIE COMPLAIN O'SULLIVAN IN THE SEMI 
I AM 
PLAYING THE BEST 
PLAYER 
IN THE 
PLAYING THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD THERE IS NO SURPRISE IN THE 
WAY HE IS PLAYING AND HE CAN PLAY 
LEFT HANDED RIGHT HANDED UP ONE 
ARM WHATEVER HE IS A PHENOMENON 
BUT I KNOW HOW TO WIN HERE WHO 
KNOWS WHAT CAN HAPPEN 
WELL PLAYED 
HOW DO YOU SEE THE CHANGE OF STYLE 
HE HAS CHANGED HIS COACH IF THINGS 
AREN'T WORKING A CHANGE IS AS GOOD 
AS A REST CHRIS HENRY SAW PETER 
EBDON TO THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS 
VICTORY ROSTER AND FROM STEPHEN'S 
POINT OF VIEW I HAVE NOTICED IT IS 
A POSSIBILITY HE MAY HAVE CHANGED 
HIS EYE SEQUENCE OF MOVEMENTS I AM 
NOT PRIVY TO ANYTHING WHEN HE 
LOOKS AT THE CUE BALL HE HAS A 
BETTER PAUSE AT THE MOMENT HIS CUE 
SEEMS TO BE UNDER MORE CONTROL 
THERE AT THE BACK BEFORE FINAL 
DELIVERY BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT 
BEHIND THE SCENES 
THERE IS STILL 
A HUNGER IN STEPHEN HENDRY YES YES GETTING THROUGH THAT FIRST ROUND 
AGAINST MARK ALLEN MARK ALLEN WILL 
BE KICKING HIMSELF SO MANY TIMES 
WE SEE A PLAYER GETS THROUGH A 
CLOSE FIRST ROUND AND GO ON TO WIN 
THE EVENT ALL OF A SUDDEN STEPHEN 
HENDRY HAS GROWN IN STATURE IT IT PUTS A NICE LITTLE MARKET DOWN HE 
SET THREE TIMES I KNOW HOW TO WIN 
HERE MARKUP 
YES THAT CONFIDENCE 
GROWS IF HE DOESN'T UP PLAYING 
RONNIE IN THE SEMI FINAL WHAT A 
TREAT FOR SNOOKER FANS 
THE STEPHEN 
HENDRY THROUGH TO THE LAST FOUR NO 
DOUBT THAT SHEFFIELD IS A CITY IT 
FOR THE WORLD SNOOKER CHAMPIONSHIPS 
A SNOOKER TABLE APPEARED AT THE 
TRAIN STATION SO JOHN AND SELBY 
COULD COAT BE COMMUTERS 
THEY COULD COACH THE COMMUTERS 
HELLO PLEASED TO MEET YOU MARK MARK SELBY 
YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT SELBY BREAKS 
YES WHAT I COULD NEVER BREAKS UNDERSTAND WHAT DETERMINED WHICH 
SIDE OF THE BALL OR HOW CLOSE TO 
IT HE WENT 
I DON'T THINK PLAYERS 
COME OFF A COUPLE OF CUSHIONS TO 
GET SO CLOSE TO THE COLOURS THE 
AIM OF THE BREAK DEPENDING WHAT 
SIDE OF THE BREAK THIS TO TRY TO 
GET IT AS CLOSE TO THE BAULK AS 
POSSIBLE AND DIRECTLY BEHIND A 
YELLOW OR GREEN 
YOU ACTUALLY BREAK 
YOU WERE RIGHT HANDED BUT YOU BREAK 
BETWEEN GREEN AND BROWN WHY AM AM NOT SURE LEFT HANDED PLAYERS 
NORMALLY BREAK BETWEEN GREEN AND 
BROWN BUT I AM RIGHT HANDED MOST MOST ARE RIGHT HANDED PLAYERS WOULD DO 
IT DIFFERENTLY 
WHICH RED ARE YOU LOOKING AT I I WILL BE LOOKING AT THE OUTSIDE RED 
O. K. 
WITH A TRACE OF LEFT HAND SIDE O. K. WHAT ABOUT IF YOU PLAYED THE RED 
FURTHER UP DOES IT OPEN TO MANY 
BALLS 
IF I END UP FLICKING A BIT BALLS TOO MUCH SIDE I CATCH THE OPPOSITE 
RED GIVE IT A CLIP ROUND THERE 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
THAT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN A BAD BREAK ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY PERFECT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN LEAVING 
THAT IN THE MIDDLE BREAK THEM UP 
AND TRY TO LEAVE AS LITTLE REDS FOR 
THE OPPOSITION 
A VERY LITTLE THERE 
PLAYERS NOWADAYS YOU LEAVE THEM 
THAT RED AND YOU WILL BE YOU WANTED 
ZERO BEHIND 
THANK YOU 
YOU WILL BE 
ONE TO ZERO BEHIND 
MORE FROM THE TRAINING STATION 
TOMORROW TWO PLACES IN THE SEMI 
FINALS DECIDED ALI CARTER 
STEPHEN HENDRY WILL IT BE JOE 
PERRY OR STEPHEN MAGUIRE WHO WILL 
JOIN THEM STEPHEN IS THE WORLD NO 
TEN FROM GLASGOW WINNER OF TWO 
TOURNAMENTS THIS SEASON HE REACHED 
THE SEMI FINALS LAST YEAR JOE 
PERRY STANDS FOURTEENTH IN THE WORLD 
RANKINGS YET TO WIN TOURNAMENT 
AND HOPING TO REACH THE LAST FOUR 
AT THE CRUCIBLE FOR THE FIRST TIME 
FOUR TO FOUR AT THE END OF THE FIRST SESSION 
LET'S JOIN THE MATCH IN FRAME 
COMMENTARY FROM TERRY GRIFFITHS AND 
WILLIE THORNE 
JOE PERRY ONE OF THE BETTER SAFETY 
PLAY YEARS PLAYERS CAN ONLY 
SAY HE CAUGHT IT TOO THIN BECAUSE 
IT HAS GONE IN AND OUT OF BAULK 
HE SEEMED TO CATCH THE RED ALL 
RIGHT AT GOOD ANGLE 
THAT IS THE WAY MAGUIRE PLAYS 
NORMALLY VERY AGGRESSIVE HE IS 
NOT KNOWN FOR TURNING MANY SHOTS 
DOWN 
WILLIE AND MYSELF WERE JUST TALKING 
OFF MIKE AND SAYING IN YEARS GONE 
BY WE WOULD SAY TONY FROM MALTA 
WAS MAD FOR GOING FOR ALL THE BALLS 
HE USED TO BUT WINE DON FEW 
YEARS AND THEY ARE ALL DOING IT 
WIND ON HOW THE GAME HAS CHANGED 
AND LIKE THE WAY HE THINKS HE IS 
ALWAYS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO OPEN 
EVERY YEAR FOR PINK AND BLACK THE 
CANNON WAS RISKY BUT IF IT WORKS 
YOU WIN THE FRAME 
GOOD RECOVERY 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE TOLD 
ME ONCE WE ALL SAY PRACTISING WITH 
HENDRY AND LEARNING SO MUCH FROM 
HIM WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG LAD 
HE SAID HE USED TO PRACTICE WITH 
HIM IN STIRLING AND LOSE FIFTEEN TO ZERO AND 
NOT GET ANY SHOTS HE SAYS HE 
ALWAYS REMEMBERS THE FIRST TIME HE 
BEAT STEPHEN HENDRY IN PRACTICE 
ONLY YOUNG LAD GOOD STORY THAT 
UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST TUITION HE 
COULD HAVE HAD THIS GAME IS ALL 
ROUND BRICK BUILDING THESE DAYS 
ALL ROUND BREAK BUILDING IF YOU 
PLAY THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD 
AT BRICK BUILDING YOU ARE GOING TO 
LEARN A LOT 
FROM THE CHAIR 
THOUGH 
IT DOESN'T MATTER ON THOUGH TELEVISION IT LOOKS TOTALLY 
DIFFERENT 
NEVER REALLY GOT SET IN THAT BREAK 
STARTED OFF WITH GOOD RED I'M 
AFRAID IT CONCLUDED WITH POOR POT 
HE COULD SEE ENOUGH OF IT CHANCE 
GONE A GOOD CHANCE 
IT WAS A LITTLE THIN INTO THE 
MIDDLE THAT WAS A VERY GOOD SHOT 
WHEN YOU AND ON THESE BLUES AND 
THEY ARE SO THIN AND YOU HAVE TO 
PLAY THEM IN THE CORNER LIKE THAT 
THEY CAN EASILY BE MISSED 
I LIKE THE WAY JOE IS LOOKING ROUND 
THE TABLE HE APPEARS TO BE TOTALLY 
ZONED IN AS IT WERE 
ESPECIALLY WITH PLAYERS LIKE RONNIE 
YOU CAN SEE WHEN HE IS IN THE MOOD 
OR WHEN HE IS NOT WHEN HE IS IN 
THE MOOD HE IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE 
BEST IN THE WORLD 
AT THE MINUTE I LIKE THE WAY JOE 
IS LOOKING 
WELL THAT IS AMAZING I WAS JUST 
SAYING HOW GOOD HE LOOKS DON'T 
THINK HE HAD BAD CONTACT HE JUST PULLED BACK TO THE CORNER 
MAGUIRE MISSED THE BLACK JOE PERRY 
MISSED AN EASY RED 
THE MIDDLE SESSION WAS ALWAYS A 
SESSION WHERE YOU COULD TRY TO PUT 
A MAN BEYOND REACH OR GET YOURSELF 
IN THE POSITION SOMETIMES YOU ARE 
TRYING TO GET BACK IN THE MATCH IT 
IS A FUNNY SESSION 
MENTALLY THE MIDDLE SESSION IS THE 
WORST THE LADS I USED TO GOING OUT 
THERE TO WIN IN BEST OF NINES MOST 
OF THE SEASON YOU DON'T GO OUT 
THERE TO WIN YOU ARE TRYING TO GET 
HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE ON THE 
SCOREBOARD IT IS SO DIFFERENT YOU 
GET A FEW FRAMES IN FRONT AND THINK 
IF I WIN THE NEXT TWO I AM TAKING 
THIS INTO THE NEXT SESSION UNLESS UNLESS OF COURSE YOU GO SEVEN TO ZERO OR EIGHT ZERO IN 
FRONT THEN YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT 
CLOSING THE MATCH OUT IN THE NEXT 
SESSION AT THIS LEVEL UNLIKELY 
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN VERY OFTEN JOE 
PERRY SHOULD HAVE WON THE FIRST A 
LOT MORE EASILY THAN HE DID AND HE 
CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE WON THIS ONE 
I THINK HE NEEDS TO HAVE ANOTHER 
CHANCE IN THIS FRAME TO ERASE THAT 
BAD THOUGHT THAT WAS SLIGHTLY AWKWARD 
I THOUGHT HE WAS DECLARING A FOUL 
BUT HE IS COMPLAINING HE CAN HEAR 
SOME OF THE HEAD BONES IN THE 
AUDIENCE WE HAVE HAD A LITTLE BIT 
OF THAT HEADPHONES 
THAT WAS ONE OF THE EARPIECES OF 
COURSE THAT THIRTY TO FORTY PER CENT OF THE 
AUDIENCE WHERE THESE DAYS NOT TO 
LISTEN TO US REALLY 
JUST TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH SOME OF 
THE SHOTS THEY MAY WANT TO LEARN 
FROM WE TALK A LOT OF NONSENSE 
SOMETIMES 
THE FRAME IS BEYOND DOUBT NOW SO 
JOE PERRY MIGHT HAVE TO SIT AND 
SUFFER THINKING THAT WAS A GOOD 
CHANCE HE HAD A FEW MINUTES AGO 
WHEN HE MISSED A STRAIGHTFORWARD 
RED 
I THINK HE JUST ALIGNED IT WRONG 
AND THAT WAS THAT SO BARRING 
SNOOKERS IT IS STEPHEN MAGUIRE WHO 
LEVELS LEVELS THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED STEPHEN IS 
AT THE TABLE IN FRAME ELEVEN FORTY FOUR POINTS 
BEHIND AS WE REJOIN THE MATCH 
I DON'T THINK IT GOES COULD BE 
SAFETY 
HE THOUGHT IT WENT AND IT STARS 
IT DOES 
SO AFTER A GOOD OPENING RED THIS 
COULD BE COSTLY FOR JOE PERRY 
NORMALLY MAGUIRE IN FULL FLOW YOU 
WOULD SAY THIS WAS REALLY GREAT 
CHANCE BUT HE HASN'T BEEN IN FULL 
FLOW IN THIS MATCH 
JOE MAY HAVE MISSED THE BOAT HERE 
ONLY SCORING FORTY WHEN THE BALLS WERE 
NICELY SPLIT O. K. HE HAD HALF A 
CHANCE IN THE MIDDLE 
THE FIRST FIFTY OF HARD WORK THE 
SECOND FIFTY IN ANY ROUND OF POINTS IS 
USUALLY THE EASIEST FIFTY HE IS TWENTY TWO BEHIND 
IF HE WINS THIS FRAME HE WILL GO 
IN FRONT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE 
MATCH 
I CAN'T SEE TOO MANY PROBLEMS WITH 
THESE THREE REDS BUT THE ONE UP AT 
THE YELLOW IT LOOKS FROM HERE AS 
IF HE WOULD POSSIBLY GO PAST THE 
BROWN INTO THE RIGHT CORNER IF HE 
GETS THAT FAR OF COURSE WOULD 
BE SURPRISED IF HE DOESN'T HE IS 
NOT HAPPY WITH THAT HE HAS GONE 
TOO FAR BUT HE ACTUALLY POTTED 
THAT RED SLIGHTLY ON THE RIGHT JAW 
AS WE LOOK AT IT AND IT WAS BIT 
ON THE THIN SIDE THAT WOULD BRING 
THE CUE BALL FURTHER OFF THE 
CUSHION STILL O. K. HE WOULD JUST BE 
STRETCHING A BIT 
YES HE CAN'T 
ROLL IT IN NOW ALREADY HE WILL BE 
THINKING OFF THE LAST BUT ONE RED 
I NEED TO GET ON THE ONE NEXT TO 
THE YELLOW GOOD RECOVERY WELL PLAYED 
THIS IS THE KEY SHOT THE NICE 
ANGLE ON THE RED TO GET UP TO THE 
BLUE THREE QUARTER BALL AND ROLL 
THE BLUE IN ALONG THE CUSHION TO 
GET ON THE RED 
HE HAS HIT THAT MILES TOO HARD 
THAT TAKES ALMOST THE BLUE OUT OF 
THE EQUATION UNLESS HE SCREWS OFF 
THE PINK 
WELL HE HAS GOT THE ANGLE ON THE 
BLACK BUT AS WE MENTIONED HE 
WOULD PREFER TO BE ON THE BLUE 
AS WE MENTIONED IT IS THE EASIER 
POSITIONAL SHOT AS WILLIE 
MENTIONED 
THAT IS THE SORT OF POSITION HE 
WOULD LIKE TO BE IN BUT HE HAS NOT 
HIT IT TOO WELL HE HAS TRIED TO 
MAKE SURE HE IS ON THE RED RATHER 
THAN GET CLOSER TO IT COULD PAY 
FOR THAT 
AN EXAMPLE OF WHY YOU TRY 
TO GET ON THE BLUE OR BAULK COLOUR 
WHEN THE RED IS IN BAULK 
GOOD POT THAT IS THE BEST SHOT HE 
HAS PLAYED TODAY IT WAS VERY TOUGH 
TO PLAY A STUN RUN THROUGH FROM 
THAT DISTANCE AND UNDER THE CUSHION 
THAT WAS FRAME BALL WHAT WE HAVE 
SEEN SO FAR TODAY PERRY SHOULD 
HAVE WON ALL THREE HE IS GOING TO 
LOSE TWO OF THE THREE THIS IS 
WHERE YOU HAVE TO DIG DEEP AND KEEP 
YOUR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AS TIGHT AS 
YOU CAN AND MAKE YOUR OPPONENT NOT 
THINK YOU ARE UNDER PRESSURE 
MAGUIRE'S HIGHEST BREAK IN THIS 
MATCH SO FAR HAS BEEN NINETY ONE JUST THE 
BLACK NOW FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO 
A BIT CARELESS ON THE BLACK BUT 
MAGUIRE DID ALL THE HARD WORK HE 
NEEDED TO DO HE COMPILED A VERY 
GOOD BREAK OF FORTY FIVE TO TAKE THE LEAD 
AT SIX TO FIVE 
THAT WAS A MIXED OPPORTUNITY FOR 
JOE WHO IS TWENTY FOUR POINTS UP IN FRAME 
TWELVE A MISSED OPPORTUNITY NOT TOO MUCH PACE REQUIRED HERE 
GOOD ATTEMPT THAT HE COULD HAVE 
CAUGHT THE INSIGHT CUSHION FIRST 
AND KNOCKED THE RED AWAY FROM THE 
POCKET THE INSIDE CUSHION THAT 
WAS AS GOOD AS HE COULD HAVE DONE 
FROM THERE HE WAS TRAPPED 
WELL MARK THAT ONE UP AS STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE'S WEST POSITIONAL SHOT 
WORST POSITIONAL SHOT HE PLAYED 
THE RED AS SLIGHTLY THIN CUT 
THAT SHOT WAS A BIG ASK OH WHAT A 
SHOT 
GREAT RECOVERY GREAT CHANCE TO 
PINCH THE FRAME 
THIS LOOKS A BIT SHORT I AM NOT 
SAYING HE WILL NOT POT THE YELLOW 
BUT HE REALLY NEEDS THE CUE BALL EIGHTEEN 
INCHES NEARER THE YELLOW THAN THIS 
THIS IS NOT TEN OUT OF TEN THE 
PRESSURE HE IS UNDER 
THAT WAS A BRILLIANT SHOT HE COULD 
HAVE LOST ALL FOUR MACRO FRAMES 
THIS AFTERNOON AND IT LOOKS AS IF 
HE IS GOING TO WIN THREE OF THE 
FOUR 
IT DOES HELP WHEN YOU CAN POT FOUR BALLS LIKE THAT 
PERRY HAD A GREAT CHANCE IN THIS 
FRAME HE GOT FIFTY NINE EARLY ON BUT DID 
NOT CLOSE OUT JUST THE BLUE AND PINK NEEDED 
THIS SESSION COULD HAVE GONE EITHER 
WAY BUT IN THE END MAGUIRE GOES 
INTO THE MID SESSION INTERVAL SEVEN TO FIVE 
IN FRONT 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE HAS BEEN SAYING HE 
WANTS TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE ROUND 
THE TABLE YOU CAN'T BE MORE 
AGGRESSIVE THAN WINNING SEVEN OF 
THE LAST EIGHT FRAMES 
IT IS REALLY 
NICE WHEN YOU CLEAR THE BALLS UP 
IT GIVES HIM CONFIDENCE HE HAS 
STOLEN A FEW FRAMES JOE PERRY DID 
NOT LOOK PARTICULARLY HAPPY AS THEY 
WALKED OUT FOR THE INTERVAL 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE GOT TO GRIPS WITH 
THIS SESSION ALL OF A SUDDEN IT 
WILL BE TOUGH GOING FOR JOE PERRY 
IN THE NEXT FEW FRAMES 
WHEN THE 
QUESTION HAS BEEN ASKED OF YOU AND 
YOU ARE IN THE DRESSING ROOM WHAT 
IS THE BEST WAY TO REACT 
YOU MIGHT 
HAVE TO LET OFF A BIT OF STEAM FOR 
A FEW MINUTES HAVE A CUP OF TEA 
COME BACK AND FOCUS YOU HAVE TO 
PLAY EVERY FRAME IF YOU ARE GOING 
TO WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP LIKE THIS 
IT IS WINNING THE FRAMES YOU 
SHOULDN'T WIN SOMETIMES STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE WON 
THREE OR FOUR FRAMES IN THIS MATCH 
BUT HE MADE GOOD CLEARANCES YOU YOU HAVE TO PUT THE BAD FRAMES BEHIND 
YOU AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE GUESS 
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE BAD MOMENT 
AND IT IS HOW YOU DEAL WITH THEM 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET OVER THEM AS 
WELL THE GOOD THING IS THAT THE 
SESSION STOPS AND YOU HAVE TIME TO 
REGROUP 
MORE ACTION FROM THAT REGROUP QUARTER FINAL ON THE WAY HERE WE

JOHN VIRGO MIGHT 
SURPRISE YOU 
NO HE CAN'T OVER OVER THE COURSE OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP WE 
HAVE HEARD FROM A VARIETY OF PEOPLE 
ABOUT THEIR AFFECTION FOR SNOOKER 
KIRSTY WARK USUALLY ASKS THE 
QUESTIONS ON THIS OCCASION THE 
NEWSNIGHT PRESENTER IS GOING TO 
ANSWER A FEW 
I HAVE PLAYED WITH HIM 
HAVE YOU I I HAVE PLAYED WITH HENDRY HE GAVE ME 
A LESSON I'M SURE IT WAS IN 
STIRLING HE GAVE ME A LESSON ONCE 
IT PAID DIVIDENDS HE WAS CHARMING 
SO QUIET AND FRIENDLY AND 
UNASSUMING THAT IS REALLY AND I 
MEAN AND THEN HE SHOWED US THE 
WHOLE TABLE WHAT HE CAN DO WITH IT 
THE CRESCENT WE LIVE IN WAS BUILT 
IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE BILLIARDS WAS A BIG DEAL 
THEN THESE WERE MIDDLE CLASS 
HOUSES BUILT FOR UP AND COMING 
INDUSTRIALISTS IN GLASGOW EVERYONE 
HAD A SNOOKER ROOM AT THE TOP A 
SNOOKER HALL NEARBY HAD CLOSED DOWN 
SO WE GOT A RECONDITIONED TABLE L. L. 
DON'T PRACTICE I'M NOT A VERY GOOD 
I HAVE GOT DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF 
RESTS SOMETIMES THEY ARE A BIT 
FAR AWAY TO SEEK AT ONE A M. THE TRICK 
THAT I DO IS WHEN I SAY I PUT MY 
RED DOWN ON THE BAIZE HE IS LIKE 
GET THAT OFF WHEN WHITE I AM 
FINE UNFORTUNATELY I OFTEN SEE 
THE SNOOKER ROOM WHEN I HAVE HAD 
MAYBE TOO MANY IT IS SLIGHTLY 
MESMERIC IT IS THE WAY I FEEL 
ABOUT 
CRICKET L. DON'T REALLY WATCH CRICKET THE TELEVISION WILL BE ON 
AND HE WILL START TO WATCH YOU 
WILL START A VERY RELAXED POSITION 
GOOD EYESIGHT NOT TOO LONG A NOSE 
AND VERY STEADY HANDS NEWSNIGHT NEWSNIGHT PRESENTER KIRSTY WARK TALKING ABOUT 
HER AFFECTION FOR SNOOKER TOMORROW 
IF PATRICK KEIL T. LET'S GO BACK 
INSIDE THE CRUCIBLE THE STEPHEN 
MAGUIRE JOE PERRY QUARTER FINAL HAS 
RESUMED FRAME THIRTEEN IS UNDER WAY 
STEPHEN MAGUIRE IS SEVEN TO FIVE UP A VITAL 
MATCH IN THE CAREER OF BOTH PLAYERS 
COMMENTARY FROM TERRY GRIFFITHS AND 
WILLIE THORNE 
MAGUIRE HAS NOT MISSED A LOT IN 
THIS FRAME JOE PERRY HAS BEEN INTO 
THE PACK TWICE ONCE OF THE GREEN 
AND ONCE OFF THE GROUND BROWN 
AND STILL HAS NOT SPLIT THEM THAT 
GOOD SOME GOOD POT AND SOME CLEVER 
POSITIONAL PLAY POTS 
THAT IS 
THE FIRST TIME HE HAS HAD A RESULT 
HE WENT INTO THE BUNCH OF THE GREEN 
AND THEN THE BROWN THAT TIME EVEN 
THOUGH HE DIDN'T DO TOO MUCH WITH 
THE BLACK HE WENT INTO THE BUNCH 
AGAIN BUT HE HAS PUSHED THREE OR 
FOUR REDS INTO PLAY IT IS A GOOD 
CHANCE THERE AS IN THE EARLY PART 
OF THIS SESSION HE HAS GOT IN 
FIRST VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE TIME 
MAGUIRE GOT IN FIRST THIS TIME 
PERRY NEEDS TO SCORE ENOUGH TO WIN 
THE FRAME IN ONE VISIT TO GET HIS 
CONFIDENCE BACK 
THAT WAS THE FIRST TESTER IN THIS 
BREAK GOOD POT L. THINK HE IS IN 
THE ONE ON THE ONE BELOW THE PINK 
THIS IS A PRECIOUS SHOT HE CAN 
PLAY FOR PINK OR BLACK PRESSURE 
SHOT 
VERY WELL PLAYED HE HAS PLAYED 
THIS BREAK BEAUTIFULLY SO FAR 
THAT IS AMAZING HOW MANY TIMES IN 
THIS MATCH AS JOE PERRY BEEN ONE OR 
TWO SHOTS AWAY FROM CLINCHING THE 
FRAME HAS JOE PERRY THAT WILL 
HURT HIM 
THE ANSWER TO YOUR 
QUESTION IS EVERY FRAME THIS 
SESSION HE LOST THREE TO ONE IN THE OPENING 
FOUR FRAMES HE COULD HAVE ONE OR 
FOUR 
HE COULD HAVE WON ALL FOUR OF 
THEM CAN MAGUIRE COME FROM BEHIND 
AGAIN
