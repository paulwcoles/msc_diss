YOU ARE WITH NEWSROUND 
IS 
WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE WORLD TODAY 
HUNDREDS OF NEGLECTED ANIMALS ARE 
FOUND IN TERRIBLE CONDITIONS ON AN 
OVERCROWDED FARM 
I HAVE BEEN FINDING OUT ABOUT THE 
BREEDING PROGRAMME THAT IS BRINGING 
THIS RIVER BACK TO LIFE 
FIRST TO A GRIM DISCOVERY AT THE 
COUNTRYSIDE FARM WHERE HUNDREDS OF 
ANIMALS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN FILTHY 
AND OVERCROWDED CONDITIONS ANIMAL 
WELFARE EXPERTS IN COUNTY DOWN IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND SAY IT IS ONE OF 
THE WORST CASES OF ANIMAL CRUELTY 
THEY HAVE EVER SEEN 
THE FARM NEAR KATESBRIDGE IN COUNTY 
DOWN HAS BEEN UNDER INVESTIGATION 
FOR A WHILE LAST NIGHT POLICE AND 
ANIMAL WELFARE EXPERTS RAIDED IT 
AND DISCOVERED HUNDREDS OF ANIMALS 
BEING KEPT IN CRUEL CONDITIONS 
AROUND THREE HUNDRED NEGLECTED FOR PIGS AND 
SOME CATTLE WERE FOUND SOME OF 
THEM WERE STARVING STARVING AND 
HAD BEEN LEFT ON THEIR OWN FOR A 
LONG TIME FORTY WERE ALREADY DEAD AND 
OTHERS WERE IN SUCH A BAD STATE 
THAT THEY HAD TO BE PUT DOWN THE 
ANIMAL WELFARE CHARITY THE USPCA 
SAID THE CONDITIONS WERE SOME OF 
THE WORST THEY HAVE SEEN AN AN APPALLING SCENE OF ANIMAL CRUELTY 
THIS FARM IS HEAVILY STOCKED IT IS 
OVERCROWDED THERE ARE NO WELFARE 
STANDARDS HERE THAT GOES FOR THE 
FOOD AND WATER 
THE USPCA RECKONS 
IT KNOWS THE FAMILY THAT OWNS THE 
FARM SOME OF THEM WERE BANNED FROM 
KEEPING ANIMALS BECAUSE OF CRUELTY 
IN THE PAST THE POLICE ARE TRYING 
TO TRACK THEM DOWN THE FARM HAS 
BEEN CORDONED OFF SO IT CAN BE 
CLEANED UP AND THE ANIMALS HAVE 
BEEN GIVEN FOOD AND WATER AND MOVED 
TO NEW HOMES 
ANIMAL CHARITIES ARE WARNING THEY 
COULD SOON BE MORE STRAY DOGS ON 
THE STREET BECAUSE OF A CHANGE IN 
THE LAW ABOUT HOW WHO HAS TO DEAL 
WITH THEM THE DOGS TRUST AND THE 
R. S. P. C. A. SAY THERE HAS TO BE MORE 
MONEY MADE AVAILABLE TO DEAL WITH 
THE PROBLEM

BEHIND THESE DOORS THERE IS A 
REALLY IMPORTANT BREEDING PROGRAMME
