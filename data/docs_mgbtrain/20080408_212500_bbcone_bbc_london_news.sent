VENUE HAS MORE AN TRIPLED THE 
AQUATIC CENTRE WILL COST OVER TWO HUNDRED FORTY 
MILLION THEY SAY THE OVERALL 
BUDGET FOR THE GAMES WON'T CHANGE 
THE STING RAY AT LOBSTER PRICES 
THIS AQUATIC CENTRE IS SUPPOSED TO 
BE THE MOST ARTISTIC VENUE OF TWO THOUSAND TWELVE 
IT IS THE FIRST BUILDING SPECTATORS 
WILL SEE WHEN THEY ENTER THE 
OLYMPIC PARK A SWIMMING COMPLEX 
DESIGNED LIKE A STREAMLINED FISH 
THERE IS PROBLEM THERE IS A HUGE 
AMOUNT OF MONEY BEING POURED INTO 
THIS SPECTACULAR SWIMMING POOL AT 
FIRST THE BUDGET WAS SET AT SEVENTY FIVE 
MILLION IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE IT 
DOUBLED AND TODAY WE ARE TOLD THE 
COST WILL BE TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION THROW IN 
THE INTEGRAL BRIDGE BESIDE IT AND 
THE WHOM COMPLEX WILL REACH THREE HUNDRED THREE

OLYMPICS BUILDING AND THE THEN 
PRIME MINISTER THE CHANCELLOR WHO 
SIGNED IT OFF OF A GIGANTIC SCALE 
THIS IS WHERE THE CENTRE IS GOING 
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PICTURE JUST 
OVER THE RIVER FROM THE ROUND BOWL 
THE OLYMPIC STADIUM ORGANISERS SAY 
THE NEW PRICE WILL NOT AFFECT THE 
BUDGET OF NINE POINT THREE BUT THE MAN WHO 
USED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING

BE LUCKY TO GET IT DONE FOR TWENTY 
BILLION 
THERE IS A BUDGET OF NINE POINT THREE BILLION BILLION WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITHIN 
THAT FOR THE LAST YEAR I'M PRETTY 
CONFIDENT COME THE END OF TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE 
WILL HAVE DELIVERED THE GAMES 
WITHIN THAT BUDGET

CERTAIN THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OLYMPICS WILL 
REALLY HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH THE 
PRICE OF A FISH
