WELCOME TO FOOTBALL GAFFES GALORE WHICH LOOKS AT MOMENTS WHEN THE BEAUTIFUL GAME WENT HORRIBLY WRONG 
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING BETTER THAN WATCHING A GOOD GAME OF FOOTBALL 
AND THAT'S WATCHING FOOTBALLERS FALLING OVER AND MISSING WHERE YOUR GRANNY COULD HAVE SCORED 
WE HAVE LOADS OF CLIPS OF THE OVERPAID IDIOTS DOING JUST THAT 
DON'T FEEL GUILTY ABOUT ENJOYING IT SINCE I'VE BEEN TALKING THEY'VE EARNED WHAT YOU DO IN A YEAR 
FIRST UP IT'S THE TOP TEN CARELESS HANDS 
IN WORLD WAR ONE THEY SAID CARELESS TALK COSTS LIVES 
GREAT CORNER GREAT HEADER GREAT SAVE YOU DIV 
SOMETIMES THE SAVE CAN BE A BIT TOO EASY AT LEAST THAT'S THE THEORY 
IT'S A MISTAKE BY THE GOALKEEPER AND RUDI VOELLER FOLLOWED IN 
YOU CAN'T BLAME THE KEEPER HERE VOELLER'S MULLET IS BEARING DOWN ON HIM LIKE A HEAD MOUNTED FERRET 
THAT'S ENOUGH TO PUT ANYONE OFF 
DAVE BEASANT WAS ONCE OUT INJURED FOR SEVERAL WEEKS 
AFTER DROPPING A JAR OF MAYONNAISE ON HIS FOOT 
LOOKS LIKE HE'S BEEN RUBBING IT ON HIS HANDS AS WELL 
OH HE'S GETTING IT EVERYWHERE NOW 
EXPERIENCED SPORTSMAN TAKES MISTAKES IN HIS STRIDE 
KEEPS HIS COOL AND DIGNITY KNOWING THE CAMERAS ARE ALWAYS ON HIM 
OH DAVID JAMES WASH YOUR MOUTH OUT 
THE SOCCEROOS' KEEPER WAS KNOWN AS SPIDER 
IN THE DRESSING ROOM AFTER THE GAME HE COULDN'T GET OUT OF THE BATH 
AND KALAC HAS MISSED IT AN AWFUL ERROR FROM THE AUSTRALIA GOALKEEPER 
AND HE ATE FLIES AND REGURGITATED HIS FOOD I MADE THAT UP 
THE TRUTH IS PRETTY BORING HE'S GOT EIGHT LEGS 
OH AND DROPPED COMPLETELY BY BROWN 
YEARS LATER BROWN LET IN TEN GOALS IN ONE MATCH AGAINST GILLINGHAM 
HERE HE IS GETTING A BIT OF PRACTICE IN 
SCOTLAND ROMPED HOME TWO TO ZERO AGAINST THIS ULTRA MOBILE ZAIRE TEAM 
AND THROUGH THE GOALKEEPER TWO TO ZERO 
LET'S SEE THAT AGAIN 
I'VE SEEN SUBBUTEO PLAYERS REACT QUICKER THAN THAT 
DALGLISH TWISTS TURNS THE SHOT IS NOTHING SPECIAL 
BUT WATCH THE GUY BEHIND THE GOAL IN THE YELLOW 
ONE CAN ONLY FEEL DESPAIR FOR RAY CLEMENCE 
HE HAS TO MEASURE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN CLEMENCE'S LEGS 
SIX FEET TWO INCHES A WORLD RECORD 
GARY SPRAKE FORGETS THE LAWS OF GRAVITY 
WHAT GOES UP MUST COME DOWN 
AND A GOAL OH AND SPRAKE FURIOUS WITH HIMSELF AS INDEED HE OUGHT TO BE 
THINK OF YOUR OWN CAREER IF IT HELPS GARY 
IF YOU MUST WEAR A BEARD TRY NOT TO COCK UP ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD 
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA END UP IN A LIST OF BEARDED COCK UPS 
THE DEFENDER HAD A BEARD NOT THAT YOU CAN SEE IT HERE NO WONDER THE CLIP IS ONLY AT N. O. SEVEN 
A MISTAKE BY DANNY MCGRAIN A SMILE ALL OVER THE FACE OF STEVE SUMNER 
IT WILL TAKE A LOT BETTER BEARD CLIP THAN THAT TO MAKE THE TOP SIX 
MOELLER OH HE HIT IVANOV 
IVANOV HAS TAKEN THAT RIGHT IN THE STOMACH 
STOMACH THAT WAS A FAST TRAIN TO PLUM CENTRAL 
ONE FOR THE GRANDCHILDREN WELL DON'T SUPPOSE THERE'LL BE ANY NOW AT LEAST HE HAS GOT A GOOD BEARD 
AT WOLVES LEGEND HAD IT THAT IF GEORGE BERRY EVER SHAVED HIS BEARD 
HE WOULD LOSE HIS FAMOUS DECISION MAKING POWERS 
HESITATION IN THE DEFENCE 
GEORGE BERRY DIDN'T SEEM TO KNOW WHETHER TO GO FOR THE BALL OR NOT 
AND CROOKS SCORES' 
HE MAY HAVE A BEARD LIKE A GOAT BUT THAT'S WHERE THE SIMILARITY ENDS 
THERE SHE GOES 
ALTHOUGH HIS TEAM MATES CALLED HIM THE DOCTOR 
SOCRATES' FULL NAME WAS SOCRATES BRASILEIRO SAMPAIO DE SOUZA VIEIRA DE OLIVEIRA 
HE KNOCKED ON MY DOOR I SAID WHO'S THERE 
DOCTOR SOCRATES BRASILEIRO SAMPAIO DE SOUZA VIEIRA DE OLIVEIRA I SAID DOCTOR WHO HE WET HIMSELF 
HERE'S LAMPARD SENIOR GIVING HIS SON FRANK A LESSON 
IN HOW NOT TO BACK PASS 
OH DEAR RESSEL RENSENBRINK BONDS JUST GOT A TOUCH 
A LESSON THE WEST HAM DEFENCE NEEDED TO PAY CLOSER ATTENTION TO 
THIS COCK UP ISN'T THAT BAD WHY IS THIS AT N. O. ONE 
OH LOOK OUT IT'S A GINGER BEARD 
HE'S PLAYED HIS JOKER BEARDS WITH TESTICLES THEY'D BELONG TO A DOG 
NOW IT'S TIME FOR OUR SPECIAL FEATURE THE TOP FIVE REALLY REALLY OVERUSED CLIPS 
WE'LL SHOW THESE CHEESY CHESTNUTS INTERSPERSED THROUGHOUT THE SHOW 
DARLING I LOVE YOU 
STARTING AT FIVE WITH HODDLE AND WADDLE 
DARLING I LOVE YOU DIAMOND LIGHTS 
I'LL ALWAYS NEED YOU 
I'M GOING TO SWEAR NOW THE CLIP WON'T GO AWAY BUT I DO FEEL A BIT BETTER 
THE TOP TEN MISSES THAT MY GRANNY COULD HAVE SCORED 
MY GRANNY WAS MORE OF A KNITTER THAN A FOOTBALLER 
AND SHE WASN'T MUCH OF A KNITTER 
I'VE NO IDEA WHO THIS IS BUT MY GRAN COULD DEFINITELY HAVE SCORED FROM THERE 
AND THERE 
IN CASE YOU DON'T SPEAK DUTCH THAT MEANS MY GRANNY COULD HAVE SCORED THAT 
HOOKED IT WIDE 
GRANNY PAT COULD HAVE GOT THAT WITH HER HANDS TIED BEHIND HER BACK 
HE SHOULD HAVE SCORED KNITTING 
JAPAN SHOULD GO ONE TO ZERO UP AGAINST CROATIA HERE 
OH 
AND YANAGISAWA HAS MISSED A GIFT OF A CHANCE HE WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED 
SHE COULD HAVE GOT THAT WITH A BAG OVER HER HEAD WHICH IS HOW SHE APPEARED IN MOST FAMILY PHOTOS 
JEEZ THAT ONE HANDS BEHIND HER BACK KNITTING BAG OVER THE HEAD 
AND FORCED TO CARRY AN ORANGE UNDER HER CHIN GRAN WOULD STILL HAVE GOT IT 
LJUNGBERG GOODNESS ME THAT IS THE MISS OF THE SEASON 
HANDS TIED KNITTING BAG OVER THE HEAD ORANGE UNDER THE CHIN PLAYING STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN ON THE BANJO 
ALL THE ABOVE PLUS NOW SENILITY HAS TAKEN HOLD 
GRAN WOULD STILL HAVE NAILED IT 
BUT SHE MAY NOT HAVE HAD THE SKILL TO GET INTO THAT POSITION SHE WAS MORE OF A CLASSIC CENTRE FORWARD 
I'LL GO OUT ON A BIT OF A LIMB HERE SHE COULD HAVE SCORED THAT TODAY 
AND SHE DIED NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AGO UNBELIEVABLE 
STEVE STONE MUST OH NO 
IT WAS LINED UP FOR A GOAL 
I'M NOT SURE SHE'D HAVE GOT THAT ONE SHE WAS NO GOOD WITH HER LEFT FOOT IT SHOULDN'T BE IN THIS LIST 
CONTRA AGAIN WRIGGLING 
HORSFIELD ONSIDE 
HOW DID THAT STAY OUT 
SHE'D HAVE HAD THAT THOUGH 
MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER COULD HAVE GOT THAT AND SHE WAS FRENCH 
IT'S THE TOP SIX CUP FINAL CATASTROPHES 
WATCHING SOMEONE STUFF UP IN A CUP FINAL IS BETTER THAN SEX 
THAT PROBABLY SAYS MORE ABOUT MY SEX LIFE THAN ABOUT THE GAFFES 
WHAT A HOWLER FROM SCHWARZER 
SYDNEY BORN MARK SCHWARZER WAS KNOWN AS SKIPPY HE'D PUNCH PEOPLE IN THE FACE AND CRAP EVERYWHERE 
IN AT FIVE CALAMITY JAMES IS BACK 
JAMES HASN'T QUITE GOT THAT AND IT'S IN 
THIS WAS THE LAST F. A. CUP FINAL AT WEMBLEY THIS MISTAKE WAS SO BAD THEY KNOCKED THE WHOLE STADIUM DOWN 
TONY ADAMS ANOTHER ONE WHO FORGETS ABOUT GRAVITY 
HERE HE IS LIFTING UP MATCH WINNER STEVE MORROW WHAT GOES UP MUST COME DOWN 
I WONDER IF THAT'S STEVE MORROW DOWN THERE 
THEY WERE LIFTING HIM ON TO THEIR SHOULDERS AND THEY DROPPED HIM 
THE POOR BLOKE WAS OUT OF IT FOR QUITE SOME TIME AT LEAST STEVE MORROW WAS O. K. 
AT THREE IT'S JAMIE CARRAGHER A CLASSIC CENTRE FORWARD'S GOAL 
IT'S GONNA BE AN OWN GOAL IT'S AN OWN GOAL 
HANG ON IT'S THE WRONG END DOES THAT COUNT 
AND ALL THE PRESSURE NOW ON ROBERTO BAGGIO WHO HAS TO SCORE 
BAGGIO WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN GETTING ITALY TO THIS WORLD CUP FINAL 
IT'S OVER THE TOP ITALIAN MANAGER SACCHI NEVER PICKED HIM AGAIN 
BUT HE WENT ON TO BECOME ENGLAND'S PENALTY COACH 
HANG ON ISN'T THAT GARY SPRAKE AGAIN 
OH IT'S A GOAL 
YEAH THAT'S VINTAGE SPRAKE ALL RIGHT RUBBISH 
OUR N. O. FOUR REALLY REALLY OVERUSED CLIP 
GOOD RUNNING BY GEOFF THOMAS ON THIS SIDE 
BRILLIANT RUNNING HE'S THROUGH 
CAN HE FINISH THERE'S THE ANSWER 
IS IT A SHOT IS IT A CROSS 
GEOFF HELP US OUT WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT 
IT'S NOT DIFFICULT TO GET ALEX FERGUSON'S KNICKERS IN A TWIST 
BUT THESE GAFFES GET HIS KNICKERS SO TWISTED 
THEY STOP THE BLOOD FLOW TO HIS OLD BOY 
IT'S GONE STRAIGHT THROUGH TAIBI 
TAIBI BLAMED THIS GAFFE ON HIS STUDS 
ALLEGEDLY THEY WERE TOO SHORT 
THERE YOU GO TOLD YOU 
GARY NEVILLE KNOWS THE REPERCUSSIONS OF HIS ERROR 
THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM COLE 
OH WHAT A MISTAKE BY SCHMEICHEL CAN HENDRIE GET THERE HE CAN 
SCHMEICHEL LATER APPEARED ON STRICTLY COME DANCING HE LOST 
BRUCE OH HE'S MISSED IT 
STEVE BRUCE'S GRANNY COULD HAVE SCORED THAT ONE 
STEVE LATER WROTE A NOVEL ABOUT A FOOTBALLER FOUND MURDERED I WONDER WHERE HE GOT THE INSPIRATION 
FABIEN BARTHEZ SOMETIMES A MAVERICK 
SOMETIMES AN ENIGMA BUT ALWAYS A 
UNITED THOUGHT HE WAS OFFSIDE BARTHEZ DARED HIM TO SHOOT EARLY 
AND DI CANIO DARED 
GIGGS FOR MANCHESTER UNITED THE GOAL IS GAPING THAT LITERALLY WAS AN OPEN GOAL 
RYAN GIGGS PROVING THAT THE WELSH ARE BETTER AT RUGBY THAN FOOTBALL AND WE'RE RUBBISH AT RUGBY 
AFTER THIS GAME FERGIE FAMOUSLY KICKED A BOOT WHICH HIT BECKHAM ON THE HEAD 
COME UP WITH YOUR OWN PUNCHLINES 
THE TOP SEVEN NOT SO FANCY DANS 
SHOWING OFF ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD IS GREAT WHEN IT WORKS 
BUT IF IT GOES WRONG YOU'RE IN TROUBLE 
HE'S IN TROUBLE 
OH AND IT BEGGED A TOUCH AND THE TOUCH DIDN'T COME 
TAKE THAT SOMEONE PLEASE TAKE IT 
FOR ROBERTO BAGGIO 
BAGGIO ENGLAND'S PENALTY COACH APPLYING TO BE SKILLS COACH TOO 
ALTHOUGH IT WAS HOTLY CONTESTED 
AND TONY POPOVIC 
OH AND IT'S AN OWN GOAL FROM POPOVIC 
THAT WAS HIS AUDITION TAPE 
DEAR OH DEAR 
A VERY UNFORTUNATE MOMENT FOR DAVID DUNN DAVID DUNN NICKNAMED THE NEW GAZZA 
PRESUMABLY BECAUSE HE WAS SLOSHED 
HERE'S CROUCH 
AT NUMBER ONE PETER CROUCH 
EVERYONE KNOWS HE'S SIX FOOT SEVEN BUT IT'S A LITTLE KNOWN FACT THAT HE'S MADE ENTIRELY OF GOLF CLUBS 
IT'S KEVIN KEEGAN 
KEEGAN'S GONE TO THE PENALTY SPOT 
HE PLAYED A GRAND TOTAL OF TWENTY FIVE MINUTES OF WORLD CUP FOOTBALL BUT IS ONLY REMEMBERED FOR THIS 
THE FIRST TIME HE'S TOUCHED THE BALL 
IF HE HAD SCORED ENGLAND WOULD PROBABLY HAVE MADE THE SEMI FINAL 
SO MANY IFS AND BUTS SO CLOSE AND YET SO FAR AND ALL THAT 
CONTROLLING THE BALL WITH YOUR HEAD IS HARDER THAN IT LOOKS 
BUT NOT AS DIFFICULT AS CONTROLLING AN ACTUAL HEAD 
WE FOUND AN OLD MAN'S HEAD DOWN BY A RAILWAY LINE ONCE IT WAS A TO CONTROL 
BE THANKFUL A FOOTBALL HASN'T GOT EARS 
JAMIE POLLOCK'S OWN GOAL SENT MAN CITY CRASHING DOWN AND KEPT QPR AFLOAT 
QPR FANS HIJACKED AN INTERNET POLL AND VOTED HIM THE MOST INFLUENTIAL MAN OF THE LAST TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
BEATING JESUS KARL MARX AND EINSTEIN WHO SIGNED FOR CHELSEA 
VEGA 
HOW DID HE MISS FROM THERE 
COME ON RAMON MY FRIEND HEADLESS DAVE COULD HAVE SCORED THAT 
NO OFFSIDE FLAG 
HE WAS A LONG WAY OFF TARGET 
BEESLEY NOTHING I SAY CAN MAKE THAT ANY FUNNIER 
SAYING THAT PAUL BEESLEY'S TECHNIQUE WAS COPIED FAR AND WIDE 
NOW D'AVRAY 
WHY DON'T THEY DO SOME REVERSE GOAL CELEBRATION AFTER OWN GOALS 
A RUN TO THE CORNER FLAG A SHIMMY THEN KILL YOURSELF 
SORRY IAN DOWIE I WAS ONLY JOKING 
THE PERFECT HEADER FROM IAN DOWIE SADLY IT WAS AT THE WRONG END 
FRANK SINCLAIR LOOKING FOOLISH AT LEAST HE WON'T DO THAT AGAINST CHELSEA NEXT WEEK 
OOPS MAYBE I JINXED THAT 
THESE ARE ALL FREE KICKS THAT WENT HORRIBLY WRONG 
DESPITE THE HOURS OF PRACTICE 
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK SCOTLAND SPENT WORKING THIS ONE OUT 
ENGLAND GOALKEEPER DAVID JAMES USED TO BE A POLICEMAN 
AND ROFFEY 
THIS IS THE MOMENT HE FIRST REALISED HE WAS A NATURAL 
REMEMBER BOYS JUST LIKE WE DID ON THE TRAINING GROUND 
HANG ON DIDN'T WE HIT IT 
THE SCOTTISH F. A. LABELLED THE URUGUAYANS THE SCUM OF THE EARTH 
URUGUAY ACCUSED THE SCOTS OF FILLING THE BALL WITH HELIUM 
DERISORY SHOUTS FROM SCOTTISH SUPPORTERS 
BECKHAM A DEAD BALL SPECIALIST 
LATER NICKNAMED GOLDENBALLS 
BACK THEN HE WAS SIMPLY KNOWN AS BALLS DECADES FROM NOW HE'LL LAUGH AT THAT 
THIS CLIP OF DIXON CHIPPING SEAMAN HAS BEEN SHOWN EIGHT MILLION TIMES 
ALTHOUGH NEVER IN EXACTLY THIS POSITION ON A CLIPS SHOW 
HOW LONG BEFORE THEY RELEASE A CLIP SHOW OF THE ONE HUNDRED GREATEST CLIP SHOW CLIP SHOW CLIPS 
I'M NOT SURE THAT MAKES SENSE 
THERE'S NOTHING MORE HUMILIATING THAN SCORING AN OWN GOAL 
CASUAL CASUAL CASUAL AND IT'S IN 
APART FROM YOUR MOTHER TURNING UP HALFWAY THROUGH A GAME 
AND HAVING A GO AT YOU FOR CALLING YOUR GRAN PONGO 
I WAS EIGHT 
BLACKBURN PAID FIFTEEN MILLION QUID FOR KENNA IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE 
IF YOU'RE QUICK HE'S ON EBAY TODAY WITH A RESERVE OF ONE POINT FIVE OH 
THIS CLIP IS PRETTY COMPLICATED 
GOALIE HANDLES OUTSIDE THE AREA 
DEFENDER ASSUMES THE REF WILL BLOW 
DEFENDER NONCHALANTLY KICKS THE BALL INTO OWN NET CAMERAMAN MISSES IT 
REF IGNORES GOALIE'S HANDBALL AND THE OWN GOAL STANDS PLAY TO THE WHISTLE 
OH IT'S AN OWN GOAL 
COME ON OWN UP WHO ORDERED THE SCOUSERGRAM 
LUCKILY TONY HADLEY'S CAREER WITH SPANDAU BALLET WAS A LITTLE MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN THIS 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SCORE AN OWN GOAL MAKE IT ONE TO REMEMBER 
GO ON HAMMER IT HOME ENJOY THE MOMENT 
OH AN OWN GOAL BY WILLIE DONACHIE 
I WONDER IF DONACHIE EVER PLAYED FOR SCOTLAND AGAIN LET ME CHECK 
NO 
FRENCHMAN FRANCK QUEUDRUE 
WAS WITTILY NICKNAMED FRENCH FRANCK NO WONDER THE FRENCH GOT RID OF IT 
DAVIDSON STARES AT THE GROUND IN DISBELIEF BUT THERE WASN'T EVEN A BOBBLE 
THAT'S WHY THIS IS AT NUMBER TEN IF THEY'D FOUND TEN PROPER BOBBLE CLIPS THIS WOULDN'T BE IN IT 
WE ALL KNOW THE BRAZILIANS CAN BEND THE BALL LEFT AND RIGHT 
BUT NOT UPWARDS SURELY WHAT A TERRIBLE MISTAKE 
REMEMBER GAMES LIKE THIS IN SCHOOL 
NOT SO MUCH A BOBBLE MORE OF A PUDDLE 
A WINDY DAY FOR THIS GAME 
WATCH OUT FOR THAT PAPER CUP THAT'S BLOWN ON THE PITCH BARRY OOPS 
THAT COFFEE CUP NOW TAKES PRIDE OF PLACE IN DERBY'S TROPHY CABINET 
THAT'S A TRUE STORY AT LEAST NOW THEY HAD SOMETHING TO PUT IN THERE 
THIS IS MORE OF A MUD SLICK 
THIS GUY OBVIOUSLY NEVER PLAYED STUCK IN THE MUD WHEN HE WAS A KID 
NOW THAT'S A PROPER BOBBLE OWN GOAL WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT 
OH DEAR THE SPONSOR SAYS IT ALL 
RAUL SPAIN'S ALL TIME LEADING GOALSCORER KISSES HIS WEDDING RING 
EVERY TIME HE SCORES APPARENTLY 
AFTER THIS COCK UP I'M GUESSING HE HAD TO KISS THE BOSS'S 
LIVERPOOL BEAT SPURS TWO TO ZERO HERE 
LIVERPOOL BOSS ROY EVANS JOKED WE BROUGHT THE PORTABLE DIVOT FROM OUR TRAINING GROUND 
IT WAS THE SAME ONE WE USED AT BLACKBURN 
SO LET'S SEE IF IT IS THE SAME ONE 
YEP THERE IT IS 
HOW EXTRAORDINARY IT JUST COMPLETELY BOBBLED RIGHT OVER TIM FLOWERS 
MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE AN INQUIRY MANY A TRUE WORD SPOKEN IN JEST 
THEY RENTED THAT DIVOT TO IPSWICH FOR THIS IMPORTANT LOCAL DERBY 
OH WHAT AN ERROR HOW ON EARTH COULD THAT HAPPEN 
EXTRAORDINARY 
AND TO ROUND IT ALL UP OUR TOP REALLY REALLY OVERUSED CLIP IS THE ANFIELD RAP 
LIVERPOOL F. C. IS HARD AS HELL 
UNITED TOTTENHAM ARSENAL WATCH MY LIPS AND I WILL SPELL 
COS THEY DON'T JUST PLAY BUT THEY CAN RAP AS WELL 
IF ALIENS LANDED AND FOUND THIS CLIP WHAT WOULD THEY MAKE OF IT 
LEARN THEM TO TALK LIKE US 
I'M RAPPING NOW RAPPING FOR FUN I'M YOUR GOALIE 
THANKS BRUCIE BUT NO THANKS OH GET IT OFF PLEASE GET IT OFF 
AHH
