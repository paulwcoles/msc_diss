GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME TO THE NEW LOOK POINTS OF VIEW 
AND JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAR WE MAY HAVE MOVED OUT OF TERRY'S SITTING ROOM 
INTO THE B. B. C. NERVE CENTRE BUT WE ARE STILL HERE FOR YOU 
NOT FOR THE SHOWER WHO RUN THIS PLACE YOU COMPLAIN I'LL BE ON YOUR SIDE 
LONG BEFORE THE CREDIT CRUNCH POINTS OF VIEW WAS WARNING OF THE CREDIT SQUEEZE 
THIS BUSINESS OF SHRINKING END CREDITS SO SMALL YOU CAN HARDLY READ THEM 
AND NOW YOU'VE MENTIONED IT I CAN'T HELP GETTING ANNOYED BY IT 
AND AS FOR THE DOG THAT LITTLE BIT OF ON SCREEN POLLUTION 
THAT TELLS US WHICH CHANNEL WE'RE WATCHING WHEN WE KNOW ALREADY 
GRRR 
AND WE WON'T ALLOW THE HIGH UPS TO PAT US ON THE HEAD AND SAY IT'S ONLY TELLY NOBODY DIED 
THEY WERE CERTAINLY ON THEIR DEATH BEDS IN CASUALTY NINETEEN OH SEVEN 
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SWEAT IT OUT 
ISN'T IT AMAZING WE HAVE THE LOUD BACKGROUND MUSIC GRIPE EVERY OTHER WEEK 
AND THE RESPONSE SEEMS TO BE TO TURN IT UP THEY WON'T DROWN OUT YOUR COMPLAINTS 
NOW IPLAYER IT'S A B. B. C. HIT A COMPUTER PROGRAM 
THAT WORKS LIKE A VIDEO YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO SET 
SO FAR SO GOOD BUT WE ARE GETTING QUESTIONS FROM THAT FAR AWAY PLANET KNOWN AS THE REAL WORLD 
ASKING IF THERE'S ANY LOGIC TO WHICH PROGRAMMES YOU GET AND WHEN YOU GET THEM 
RIGHT NOW WE ALL HAVE TO JOIN HANDS AND TURN A GLASS UPSIDE DOWN TO WORK OUT WHAT WILL BE ON IPLAYER 
YOU ARE FRUSTRATED BY THAT AND WE CAN NOW REVEAL THE SOLUTION STAND BY FOR OUR BOFFIN CLIP 
IN A FEW MONTHS WE ARE GOING TO IMPROVE THE IPLAYER SITE 
SO THAT WE SHOW YOU A SCHEDULE OF PROGRAMMES 
THAT ARE GOING TO BE AND NOT GOING TO BE AVAILABLE ON IPLAYER 
SO YOU CAN PLAN YOUR VIEWING ACCORDINGLY 
THERE'S YOUR ANSWER IPLAYER SCHEDULE LIVE IN JUNE I'VE BEEN AMAZED 
AT HOW MANY EMAILS WE'VE HAD SHOWING THE BEEB'S HIGH TECH GADGET HAS SUCH A LOW TECH PROBLEM 
TONY MUNRO FROM DERBYSHIRE PROTESTS WHY ISN'T CRUFTS AVAILABLE ON IPLAYER 
I CANNOT BELIEVE THERE WOULD NOT BE A DEMAND FOR IT 
WE'RE AVERAGING NINETY FIVE TO NINETY EIGHT PER CENT CONTENT AVAILABILITY 
SOMETIMES ONE SLIPS THROUGH IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE CRUFTS CAME OUT THE NEXT DAY 
NOT AT THE TIME THAT WE'D HAVE LIKED TO HAVE IT OUT 
ALEX VINEBOURNE WHO'S DEAF WANTS PEOPLE LIKE HIM CATERED FOR 
I NEED SUBTITLES ON IPLAYER PROGRAMMES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON 
IN THE LATEST IPLAYER NOW THERE IS A DEDICATED SIGN ZONE WHICH SHOWS YOU SUBTITLED AND SIGNED CONTENT 
DOWNLOADS NOW HAVE SIGNED SUBTITLES AVAILABLE 
AND SHORTLY WE HOPE TO HAVE SUBTITLES AVAILABLE FOR STREAMED CONTENT AS WELL 
PETER BEATON CAN'T GET HIS COMPUTER TO RUN IPLAYER PROPERLY 
I THINK THINGS TO CHECK ARE ANY OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD DOING BIG DOWNLOADS AT THE TIME 
ARE YOU ON W. I. FI IF NOT FIXED LINE IS BETTER CHECK YOUR I. S. P. AS WELL CHECK YOUR BANDWIDTH PLANS 
SO IF YOU'RE CONSTANTLY HAVING TROUBLE I THINK ACTUALLY WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO IS KNOW ABOUT IT 
SO GO TO THE IPLAYER MESSAGE BOARDS AND TELL US ABOUT IT 
SO UNTIL JUNE WHEN IPLAYER PUTS OUT THAT VIEWING GUIDE HERE'S MY ADVICE 
DON'T LEAP ONLINE WHILE A SHOW IS STILL ON AIR 
SIXTY PER CENT OF PROGRAMMES ARE PUT UP WITHIN A FEW MINUTES 
BUT FOR THE REST IT'S UP TO THREE HOURS 
IF AFTER THREE HOURS THE SHOW YOU WANT IS NOT THERE IT MAY BE COPYRIGHT 
IT MAY BE TECHNICAL WHATEVER CHANCES ARE IT WILL NEVER BE IPLAYED 
HEY LOOK THAT TEA TIME FAVOURITE GREAT BRITISH MENU IS ON IPLAYER TOO 
DID I SAY TEA TIME FAVOURITE CLEARLY NOT WITH VIEWER JANE LONGHURST 
NO NO 
NO NO PLEASE NO 
I DON'T BELIEVE IT THEY'VE DONE IT AGAIN 
THEY'VE DONE IT AGAIN A WHOLE YEAR WITHOUT JENNIE BOND 
AND SHE'S BACK WITH A VENGEANCE I'M REALLY REALLY SORRY B. B. C. 
BUT YOU'VE JUST GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS IT'S JUST SO INANE 
IT'S SO EMBARRASSING IT'S JUST AWFUL AND CAN THIS WOMAN COOK 
ANTHONY LIKES TO GO THE WHOLE HOG AND TODAY IS NO EXCEPTION 
NO I'M JUST CRINGING WITH EMBARRASSMENT WHEN THIS WOMAN IS MAKING THESE INANE COMMENTS 
ABOUT THESE MICHELIN STARRED CHEFS AND IMPLYING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE HAVING COMBAT 
AND YOU KNOW NEXT WEEK IS THE WAR OF THE ROSES 
BECAUSE IT'S A LANCASTRIAN AND A YORK CHEF I MEAN GIVE ME A FAT BREAK PLEASE 
DO YOU RECOGNISE JANE SHE SENT TERRY A VIDEO A WHILE BACK SHOWS HOW EASY IT IS 
JUST GET ON THE WEBSITE AND SEND US YOUR SHOUT OR YOUR WHISPER 
YOU CAN DO IT WITH YOUR PHONE THIS RATHER SILLY OBJECT IS MY PHONE SORRY ABOUT THAT 
YOUR VIDEO CAMERA OR WEBCAM WE'VE GOT EASY TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS ONLINE 
AND WE REALLY WILL TRY TO HAMMER HOME YOUR MESSAGES TO THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE 
SO IN THAT SPIRIT WE'LL SEE WHAT GREAT BRITISH MENU HAVE TO SAY FOR THEMSELVES NEXT WEEK 
NOW ONE PROGRAMME ON B. B. C. THREE HAS BEEN GETTING MORE TRAILS THAN DOCTOR WHO 
HANG ON MORE TRAILS THAN DOCTOR WHO NOT POSSIBLE 
NO IT HAS BEEN YOUNG MUM'S MANSION THE ADS HAVE WORKED 
YMM IS GETTING ROUGHLY HALF A MILLION VIEWERS 
DOUBLE WHAT'S EXPECTED FOR THAT SLOT SO TO THOSE VIEWERS 
SO WHAT DID YOU THINK LAST NIGHT TO MUM'S MANSION THEN 
THROWN TOGETHER IN A MANSION AND 
SORT OF BIG LIKE ARGUMENTS AND 
A LOT OF SWEARING AND STUFF LIKE THAT WITH THEIR CHILDREN 
I THOUGHT THAT WHEN THESE YOUNG MUMS WENT IN TO THE MANSION 
THEY'D BE THERE TO KIND OF IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND TO GROW IN CONFIDENCE 
AND TO LEARN HOW TO LOOK AFTER THEIR CHILDREN BUT I DIDN'T SEE MANY PROFESSIONALS ON HAND 
I THOUGHT THERE'D BE MORE PEOPLE INTERVENING AND GUIDING THEM 
WHILE I'M LEADER THINGS ARE GONNA BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT 
WELL THERE WAS ONE GIRL IN IT I DON'T KNOW HER NAME 
AND THEY WERE DOING A NAKED PHOTO SHOOT AND SHE 
SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE VERY MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HERSELF 
BUT YOU KNOW SHE GOT UP AND SHE DID IT AND SHE LOOKED GREAT 
I DON'T THINK THEY REALLY WOULD HAVE GAINED LOADS FROM IT 
THEY'D BEEN THERE A GOOD SPACE OF TIME SO 
I SUPPOSE ONE PERSON COULD LEARN SOMETHING OUT OF IT 
I THINK IT'S MORE FOR ENTERTAINMENT THE PROGRAMME 
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN IT 
B. B. C. THREE'S AUDIENCE WINNER YOUNG MUM'S MANSION THERE 
AND ANOTHER SURPRISE THAT'S DRAWING THE CROWDS IS ON IN ABOUT AN HOUR 
AND THAT'S SEASIDE RESCUE NOW NORMALLY WE'RE ONLY ALLOWED TO TAG ALONG WITH HELICOPTER HEROES 
TRAFFIC COPS AND THE LIKE ON MIDWEEK EVENINGS WHEN OUR HEARTS CAN STAND THE TENSION 
BUT SUDDENLY THE B. B. C. HAS DECIDED TO TRADE IN SUNDAY'S SEDATE ANTIQUES 
AND COBBLES AND BONNETS DRAMAS FOR HIGH OCTANE LURCHING IN LIFEBOATS 
COASTGUARDS HAVE REQUESTED THE LAUNCH OF THE FALMOUTH LIFEBOAT 
THE IDEA WAS ALL THOSE OF THE SCHEDULERS IN LONDON 
THEY CAME TO US AND SAID THAT THEY'D LIKE TO TRY 
SEASIDE ON SUNDAY EVENING AND WE'RE VERY INTERESTED TO SEE HOW IT PERFORMS 
IT'S OBVIOUSLY AN UNUSUAL SLOT BUT I THINK THAT IT MAKES A REFRESHING CHANGE 
FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE SOMETHING WITH A BIT MORE ADRENALINE AT THAT TIME 
JULIAN MERCER THERE WHO'S WAVING NOT DROWNING 
LET'S BOB AROUND A BIT MORE IN THE SUNDAY NIGHT SCHEDULE UP NEXT ON YOUR LIST IS MY FAMILY 
NOW THIS SITCOM FROM THE START TRIGGERED A DOMESTIC BETWEEN VIEWERS WHO LOVE IT 
AND FEEL IT'S THE EPITOME OF WELL WRITTEN WELL ACTED COMEDY 
AND THOSE WHO LOATHE IT BOTH SIDES ARE UNITED THOUGH ABOUT THE REPEATS 
WHY SO MANY GOOD POINT ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE ABLE TO WATCH PROGRAMMES 
ON OUR OWN TERMS SO MUCH MORE EASILY NOW WITH IPLAYER AND SKY AND SO ON 
WHY TRANSMIT THEM MORE THAN ONCE THIS AT LEAST IS A NEW SERIES 
LOOK MY DEAR MY NAME IS BEN HARPER 
AND I'M A PAYING CUSTOMER AT THIS BANK AND TO BE HONEST I'M SORRY 
I DON'T LIKE YOUR ATTITUDE 
NOTHING WORSE THAN A FIGHT IN THE FAMILY 
NOW AM I NORMAL CAN WE HOLD OFF ON ANSWERING THAT 
IT'S ACTUALLY THE TITLE OF THE NEXT PROGRAMME YOU WANT TO GET YOUR SCALPEL INTO 
IT'S DESCRIBED AS A CONTROVERSIAL NEW SERIES BUT ALWAYS WATCH THE WORD CONTROVERSIAL 
IT'S THE IN HOUSE WAY OF SAYING YOU PROBABLY WON'T LIKE WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE 
BUT DON'T BLAME US FOR IT IN NEWS IT OFTEN SEEMS TO BE USED 
TO REGISTER A KIND OF OBJECTIVE DISAPPROVAL 
AS WHEN A PRESENTER SAYS THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER REMARK FROM A CONTROVERSIAL POLITICIAN 
ANYWAY WHAT OF THE CONTROVERSIAL AM I NORMAL 
THIS WAS ABOUT PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS 
IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS YOU'RE A LIAR 
GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER SORT YOUR LIFE OUT 
INSTEAD OF MAKING MORAL JUDGEMENTS WE'RE MAKING PSEUDO MEDICAL JUDGEMENTS 
INSTEAD OF SAYING THIS PERSON'S BEHAVIOUR IS BAD 
NOW WE USE THIS PSEUDO MEDICAL LANGUAGE CALLED HEALTH AND ILLNESS 
HOW CONTROVERSIAL 
NOW BY ALL ACCOUNTS HALF THE POPULATION ARE AT THIS MOMENT 
PREPARING SALTWATER GARGLES AND INDULGING IN A FEW LAST MINUTE BREATHING EXERCISES 
PRIOR TO A SPOT OF SONGS OF PRAISE KARAOKE 
NOW TO MY ETERNAL SHAME I HAD NO IDEA THAT IN SITTING ROOMS 
AND EVEN WORKING MEN'S CLUBS UP AND DOWN THE LAND 
BURLY BARITONES ARE ABOUT TO BELT OUT BREAD OF HEAVEN AND THE LIKE 
IN AN OVER ENTHUSIASTIC MANNER AND THEY'VE GOT A PROBLEM 
THE SONGS OF PRAISE PROGRAMME MAKERS 
BEING PRIVY TO THE NATION'S SECRET SING ALONG 
PUT THE WORDS ON SCREEN TO HELP OUT 
STIRRING STUFF THE SUBTITLES ARE TIMED 
SO THEY APPEAR ON SCREEN WHEN THE WORDS ARE SUNG 
BY THE CONGREGATION BUT THAT IS TOO LATE FOR VIEWERS LIKE JOHN HODGSON 
WHO LOVE TO SING ALONG AT HOME BUT STRUGGLE AT THE MOMENT 
ONE THING I DID FIND WAS THAT THE SUBTITLES CAME ON AT EXACTLY THE TIME 
WHEN THE LINE CHANGED SO IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO READ AHEAD 
JOHN CREATED HIS OWN VERSION OF THE SUBTITLES ON HIS COMPUTER 
THE WORDS APPEAR SLIGHTLY BEFORE THEY'RE SUNG BY THE CONGREGATION 
MEMBERS OF THE CHOIR OF SAINT ANNE'S CHURCH AT SINGLETON IN LANCASHIRE 
WHO LOVE TO WATCH AND SING ALONG TO SONGS OF PRAISE AT HOME WOULD MUCH PREFER EARLIER SUBTITLES 
IF YOU DO ENJOY SINGING AT HOME 
I THINK IT WILL GIVE YOU GREATER FREEDOM TO REALLY JOIN IN 
IT WOULD HELP SO I COULD SING ALONG WITH THE HYMN 
IT IS JUST THAT SPLIT SECOND SOONER WHICH IS GREAT 
BUT SONGS OF PRAISE WHILE MINDFUL OF THE MINORITY OF VIEWERS 
WHO CAN SING APPARENTLY HAS TO CONSIDER THE VISUAL IMPACT 
OF EARLY SUBTITLES ON THE SILENT MAJORITY 
THE CHALLENGE OCCURS WHEN ACHIEVING THAT AMBITION ENTAILS 
THE CAPTION CHANGING JUST BEFORE A PICTURE CHANGE 
WHICH RESULTS IN A DOUBLE CUT WHICH IS VERY DISTRACTING 
TO VIEWERS WHO ARE WATCHING BUT NOT SINGING ALONG 
I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO MR. HODGSON FOR HIS REMINDER 
AND I'LL TRY TO ACCOMMODATE HIS SUGGESTIONS WHENEVER POSSIBLE 
HE MAY LIKE TO KNOW THAT WE'RE LOOKING INTO THE POSSIBILITY 
OF VIEWERS BEING ABLE TO SELECT AND DESELECT THEIR OWN SUBTITLES 
WHICH COULD PROVIDE A SOLUTION FOR THE FUTURE 
THIS IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A PROBLEM WHERE WE'RE TOLD 
DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY WILL SOLVE IT IN THE NEAR FUTURE 
SHALL WE BRING IN A SWEAR BOX 
FOR WHEN THAT VERY IRRITATING PHRASE IS USED 
WOW THAT ACTUALLY BLEW MY HAIR BACK 
GOOD TO END MY FIRST POINTS OF VIEW WITH ROUSING MUSIC 
YOU SUPPLY US MATERIAL SO I WAS GONNA SAY THIS IS THE ONE PROGRAMME YOU CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT 
BUT I DON'T THINK I WANT TO LAUNCH WITH THAT KIND OF INVITATION 
YOU JUST SEND US WHATEVER IS ON YOUR MIND 
WE WANT FILMS OR YOU CAN VOLUNTEER TO REPORT OR JUST WRITE TO US 
WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN AND MAYBE CHANGE SOME THINGS AROUND HERE 
TILL NEXT SUNDAY SAME TIME SAME PLACE SEE YOU THEN 
YOU'VE BEEN THE ONE TO BEAT 
THERE IS NO COMPETITION 
NO ONE'S GONNA MAKE A FOOL OUT OF ME 
DING DING ROUND TWO 
WHICH IS BETTER THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT 
THE BIGGEST NAMES IN BRITISH T. V. GO HEAD TO HEAD
