LONDON'S AN AWESOME PLACE TO BE 
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE 
WE'VE GOT A GOOD LITTLE DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY GROUP GOING ON 
COULD TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BE THE YEAR THAT WE MAKE IT BIG 
THE YEAR 
I'M LOUIS 
MUSICIAN 
AND EX M. T. V. PRESENTER 
BAD BOY 
I'M LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A REALLY TALENTED GROUP OF MATES 
WITH BIG AMBITIONS FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
THAT'S OUR ASPIRING ACTOR DARYL 
HE'S AN EAST END BOXER PRETTY BOY MODEL 
AND QUITE POSSIBLY THE MOST HANDSOME MAN YOU'LL EVER MEET 
YEAH I COULD BE THE NEXT JAMES BOND MAYBE 
THIS LITTLE MINX IS PORTIA SHE'S A MODEL AS WELL 
AND ACCORDING TO THE PAPERS SHE'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT KATE MOSS 
AND WAS EVEN ONCE LINKED TO PETE DOHERTY 
BOYS THIS YEAR ARE NOT GOING TO BE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY 
IT'S GONNA BE ME AND MY JOB 
WICKED 
KESH IS OUR STREET FASHION DESIGNER 
THE CLOTHES SHE MAKES HAVE BEEN WORN BY KANYE WEST 
AND MARIAH CAREY 
MAYBE ONE DAY WHEN I'M LIKE SITTING ON A STACK OF CASH 
I CAN SAY YES I'VE MADE IT 
THEN THERE'S MY BEST FRIENDS MODEL DAISY LOWE AND SINGER WILL 
THEY'RE TOTAL JOKERS AND ARE HEAD OVER HEELS IN LO O. OVE 
WILL'S WELL KNOWN ON THE LONDON SCENE 
AND IS THE FRONT MAN OF ROCK BAND BLONDELLE 
WILL IS MY FIRST LOVE 
AND MY ONLY LOVE AND MY BOYFRIEND 
AND MY OTHER BEST FRIEND APART FROM LOUIS 
DAISY'S ALREADY A TOP BRITISH MODEL 
LONDON SOCIALITE LOOK BEHIND YOU AND ALL ROUND SEXY LADY 
OVER THE NEXT EIGHT WEEKS YOU'RE GONNA WATCH US 
TRY AND MAKE A LIVING DOING THE THINGS WE LOVE 
I'M IN LOVE WITH MY LOOK 
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY 
I CAN'T WHEN I'M IN THIS OUTFIT 
HE CAN OFF 
BUT CAN WE GET IT TOGETHER 
I CAN'T GET HER IN MAN I'VE MISSED IT 
I JUST WANT MY MUMMY HERE 
AND STAY TOGETHER 
CAN YOU TRUST ME 
ON THE ROCKY ROAD TO SUCCESS 
YEAH I RECKON TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IS MY CAREER YEAR 
THIS WEEK DAISY MAKES A LIFE CHANGING DECISION 
THAT LEAVES ME WILL AND PORTIA ALL QUESTIONING OUR FUTURES 
THIS IS CAMDEN 
THE HEART OF COOL LONDON 
ONCE HOME TO AMY PETE JONNY 
FOR NEARLY A YEAR WILL DAISY AND I LIVED TOGETHER IN THIS LITTLE PLACE 
PURE FIVE STAR ACCOMMODATION OF COURSE 
LIVING WITH BOYS IS A BAD IDEA 
IT'S JUST A REALLY REALLY BAD IDEA 
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME ALL TO DO WITH WILL 
IT WAS DISGUSTING THERE WERE OLD DOUGHNUTS FROM THREE WEEKS AGO 
IT'S WAS SO SO GROSS 
BUT THINGS ARE ABOUT TO CHANGE 
DAISY HAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED HERSELF AS A TOP BRITISH MODEL 
I WAS MODELLING DURING SCHOOL 
AND WAS JUST LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA GO OFF AND LEAVE SCHOOL 
AND I'M GONNA DO THIS BECAUSE THIS IS MY CALLING RIGHT NOW 
HAVING MODELLED FOR BIG NAMES LIKE CHANEL AND AGENT PROVOCATEUR 
SHE'S NOW SET HER SITES ON BECOMING AN INTERNATIONAL SUPERMODEL 
I'M GONNA MOVE TO NEW YORK FOR SIX MONTHS OR MAYBE MORE 
MAYBE LESS WHO KNOWS BUT HOPEFULLY A WHILE 
FOR FASHION NEW YORK IS THE FASHION CAPITAL OF THE WORLD 
IT'S GOT KIND OF SIXTY PER CENT OF ALL THE FASHION WORK THAT THERE IS IN THE WORLD 
IT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN NEEDING TO DO FOR A WHILE 
I'VE BEEN HOLDING IT OFF BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN LOVE WITH MY BOYFRIEND 
DAISY AND WILL HAVE BEEN INSEPARABLE SINCE MEETING 
AT ONE OF HIS GIGS TWO YEARS AGO 
IT'S REALLY JUST BEEN A CASE OF US HAVING TO SACRIFICE OUR RELATIONSHIP 
SO THAT SHE CAN WORK HARDER 
AT BECOMING A SUPERMODEL 
AND I CAN CONCENTRATE ON MY FIRST LOVE 
WHICH IS WRITING SONGS 
AAH 
MORNING HAS BRO KEN 
THE WEIRDEST BREAK UP I'VE EVER HAD 
COS WE ARE 
YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT 
AND SO I THINK THAT MADE IT HARDER FOR BOTH OF US 
THAT IS THE CARD SHE WROTE ME 
IT SAYS DEAREST WILLIAM THANK YOU FOR BEING MINE FOR A WHOLE YEAR 
I NEVER KNOW WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT REAL LOVE WAS UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG 
I THOUGHT I DID BUT I REALLY DIDN'T 
YOU'RE THE BEST BOYFRIEND I COULD HAVE EVER ASKED FOR ALL YOURS DAISY 
THAT CAN'T BE FOR ME 
LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA 
YO 
WHAT'S THE DEAL 
AIN'T NOTHING 
SO WE'RE ALL GOING TO MISS DAISY 
BUT AT LEAST IT'S AN EXCUSE FOR ONE HELL OF A PARTY 
BEFORE SHE GOES 
OOH OOH EE 
ALL OF OUR FRIENDS ARE JUST SO CLOSE KNIT 
SO TO SUDDENLY JUST NOT HAVE THEM IS REALLY HORRIBLE 
MY FAMILY AND MY FRIENDS ARE SO IMPORTANT IN MY LIFE 
AND HERS IS NO ORDINARY FAMILY 
SHE COMES FROM ROCK 'N ROLL ROYALTY 
THAT'S HER MUM 
NINETIES ROCKER PEARL LOWE 
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER 
COS WE GREW UP TOGETHER COS I WAS SO YOUNG WHEN I HAD HER 
SHE WOULD ORGANISE ME I MEAN 
IF WE WENT ON HOLIDAY SHE'D HAVE THE PASSPORTS 
SHE'D HAVE THE TICKETS 
SHE'D SAY MUMMY I DON'T TRUST YOU THIS WAS WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT SEVEN 
AND THAT'S HER STEPDAD DANNY GOFFEY FROM SUPERGRASS 
MOVING TO NEW YORK YOU KNOW THAT'S QUITE A MAD THING FOR AN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YEAR OLD TO DO 
TO KIND OF MOVE ON HER OWN WHICH I THINK IT'S GONNA BE GREAT FOR HER 
YOU KNOW UM 
BUT YEAH SHE'S MY LITTLE GIRL 
DANNY GOES OFF AND PLAYS IN A BAND AND I GO AND DESIGN 
AND SHE GOES AND MODELS BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S THE THING 
OUR FAMILY DYNAMIC IS AS CRAZY AS ANY OTHER FAMILY DYNAMIC YEAH 
BUT WE ARE YOUNG 
SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST WARM HEARTED PEOPLE I'VE EVER MET IN MY LIFE 
AND IT'S REALLY SAD THAT WE HAVE TO PART 
I'M TRULY BROKEN HEARTED ABOUT THE FACT THAT SHE HAS TO LEAVE 
HONESTLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO WITHOUT HER 
I CAN'T TAKE CARE OF MYSELF I'M A COMPLETE IDIOT 
LIKE DAISY DID MY WASHING SHE DID THE WASHING UP 
I DUNNO HOW I'M GONNA LIVE IN THAT FLAT WITHOUT DAISY BEING THERE 
I THINK SHE'S GONNA DO AMAZINGLY IN NEW YORK 
SHE'S GONNA EARN HER NAME OVER THERE AND YOU KNOW 
SHE'S GONNA ROCK IT OVER THERE 
I SPEAK TO HER EVERY SINGLE DAY AND SHE COMES DOWN MOST WEEKENDS 
SHE'S MY BEST MATE SO IT'S GONNA BE REALLY HORRIBLE WITHOUT HER 
CHEERS 
CHEERS 
OH 
TINGLE 
AWW 
I DON'T LIKE THIS GOODBYE CRAP 
DAISY AND WILL BREAKING UP FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR CAREERS HAS GOT US ALL THINKING 
NONE MORE SO THAN PORTIA 
SHE'S TRYING TO BOOST HER MODELLING CAREER 
AFTER PUTTING A RELATIONSHIP FIRST FOR THE PAST YEAR 
I FELL IN LOVE AND 
FOR TWO YEARS I KIND OF HID I DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO 
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE AWAY FROM HIM I WANTED TO BE WITH HIM THE WHOLE TIME 
UNFORTUNATELY LIKE MOST OF MY RELATIONSHIPS 
PORTIA'S DIDN'T LAST 
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AND YOU 
UNLIKE MOST MODELS 
PORTIA'S CAREER STARTED AT THE TOP 
SINCE BEING SPOTTED AT CLOTHES SHOW LIVE WHEN SHE WAS FIFTEEN 
SHE'S APPEARED IN ALL THE TOP FASHION MAGAZINES 
HER FIRST BEING VOGUE 
IT WAS THIS ISN'T TRUE THIS IS A DREAM 
YOU'RE REALLY REALLY PROUD INSIDE 
AND YOU WANT TO BURST AND TELL THE WHOLE WORLD 
WITH BOYS OUT OF HER MIND PORTIA'S NOW FOCUSING ON HER CAREER 
I'VE ACTUALLY GOT THE PASSION BACK INSIDE OF ME 
TO SUCCEED IN WHAT I DO 
LIKE ANY JOB IF YOU THINK YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF 
AND THE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT YOU AROUND YOU BELIEVE IN YOU 
YOU CAN GET ANYWHERE YOU WANT TO BE 
AND I'VE GOT THAT SORT OF SUPPORT FROM MY LOVED ONES 
AND I'M GONNA GET THERE 
ER PORTIA I'M NO MODEL BUT I THINK YOU MIGHT NEED TO PERFECT YOUR CATWALK A BIT FIRST HUH 
AS SOON AS DAISY WAS ON THE PLANE TO NEW YORK 
WILL MOVED IN WITH HIS BAND BLONDELLE 
I'M LIVING WITH THIS ONE 
AND I'M LIVING WITH THAT ONE 
THEY GO BY THE NAME OF TWEEDLEDEE 
AND TWEEDLEDUM 
SACRIFICING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH DAISY FOR BEING IN A BAND HAS MADE ME SO MUCH MORE HUNGRY 
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE THROWN AWAY A PERFECTLY GREAT EXISTENCE FOR NOTHING 
BLONDELLE HAVE BEEN TOGETHER SINCE THEY WERE FOURTEEN 
SINGER WILL GREW UP NEXT TO LEAD GUITARIST SAM WHOSE COUSIN RORY PLAYS BASS 
FINALLY MY LOCAL BARMAN MIKE HE PULLS PINTS AND PLAYS DRUMS 
WELL YOU GOTTA PAY THE BILLS SOMEHOW EH 
AND I WONDER 
NOW BLONDELLE AREN'T JUST ANY OLD UP AND COMING BAND 
YOU'D REMEMBER THEM FROM THIS TOP TEN HIT 
WELL IF YOU'D EVER LIVED IN JAPAN 
I DO FEEL LIKE IT'S MAKE OR BREAK FOR THE BAND 
NOW WE HAVE TO PRODUCE THE BEST SONGS EVER 
WITH THE MOST INTEGRITY AND PLAY THEM WITH A VENGEANCE WHEN WE DO GIGS 
UM IF NOT WE SHOULD JUST PACK UP 
AND ALL GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS NOW BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANNA DO 
I'M CURRENTLY SHARING A BED WITH SAM 
SAM AND RORY SAY HELLO 
WE'RE LIKE BEST FRIENDS I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY IN THE WORLD 
AS WELL AS I KNOW THOSE GUYS 
SO WE'RE KIND OF LIKE BROTHERS 
AND THIS IS WHERE 
RORY AND MIKE STAY 
IT'S QUITE CUTE ISN'T IT 
AND THIS IS THE POLE THE OBLIGATORY STRIP POLE 
ANY SELF RESPECTING BAND MEMBER HAS TO HAVE A STRIP POLE 
AND THIS IS WHERE SAM AND I SHARE A BED 
IS THERE NO LIMIT TO THE SACRIFICES THIS BAND WILL MAKE 
I THINK IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD ON BOTH WILL AND DAISY 
YEAH SINCE SHE MOVED AWAY TO NEW YORK 
I MEAN IMAGINE YOUR GIRLFRIEND MOVES THREE THOUSAND MILES AWAY HOW WOULD YOU FEEL 
I DUNNO IT'S PRETTY 
I THINK HE HIDES IT QUITE WELL 
I'M JUST REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE COS IT IS SUCH AN AMAZING CITY 
I MEAN IN THE SHORT TWO WEEKS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE 
I'VE DONE QUITE A LOT OF SOUL SEARCHING WHICH HAS BEEN REALLY GOOD 
OH SO WELCOME TO MY APARTMENT 
THESE SHOES ME AND WILL HAVE MATCHING ONES 
AND WE'RE ONLY ALLOWED TO WEAR THEM WHEN THE OTHER ONE'S WEARING THEM 
I DON'T KNOW IF THE RULE STILL APPLIES BUT IT SHOULD DO 
COS I HAVEN'T WORN THEM 
AND THEN THIS IS MY FRIDGE WHICH BASICALLY JUST CONSISTS OF CUPCAKES 
PEANUT BUTTER HUMMUS GRAPES WATER AND JUICE 
THIS IS MY BEDROOM 
AND I JUST REALLY LOVE IT COS I THINK JUST REALLY WEIRD 
UM BUT I DO I JUST LOVE THIS PLACE 
I LOVE THIS ROOM 
AND I'VE PUT UP ALL MY DIFFERENT PICTURES 
OF LIKE NEBULAS 
AND HYDROGEN GAS CYLINDERS THAT UM ACT AS COCOONS WITH STARS 
THERE'S A PHOTO OF VENUS 
DAISY I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN SPENDING 
A LITTLE TOO MUCH TIME ALONE 
UM 
THAT IS JUPITER 
WHILST HER APARTMENT MIGHT BE OUT OF THIS WORLD 
IT'S STILL NOT QUITE HOME 
THAT REALLY CUTE ONE OF WILL I LOVE THAT PICTURE 
I'M STILL GETTING USED TO THE FACT THAT I HAVE TO SLEEP ON MY OWN 
WITHOUT WILL CUDDLING ME 
IT IS SCARY 
COS LIKE I'M A SINGLE GIRL IN NEW YORK AND I'M ON MY OWN 
AND WHAT IF SOMEONE BROKE IN I'D BE TOTALLY HELPLESS 
I MISS AND LOUIS SO MUCH 
UM 
I JUST WANNA GIVE BOTH OF THEM A REALLY BIG CUDDLE 
AND IT'S WEIRD BEING WITHOUT THEM I HATE BEING WITHOUT THEM 
I MISS LIVING WITH YOU TOO DAISE 
I LOVE YOU 
AT LEAST WILL DOESN'T HAVE TO COPE ALONE 
HE'S GOT THE COMPANY OF HIS BAND MATES 
LIVING TOGETHER ALL UNDER THE SAME ROOF IS PRODUCTIVE FOR US 
IF WE HAVEN'T BEEN WRITING WE'VE BEEN REHEARSING STUFF WE'VE JUST WRITTEN 
GUITAR INTRO 
WE'RE WORKING HARDER THAN EVER 
AFTER ALL THIS HARD GRAFT 
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME PRETTY CRAZY ROCK'N'ROLL NIGHTS 
THIS ISN'T PERI PERI THIS IS JERK BUT IT'S NOT GONNA WORK 
THERE'S TOO MUCH LIQUID IN THERE 
COME ON THE BROCCOLI'S GONNA GET COLD 
LIVING IN THIS HOUSE IS DIFFERENT 
I DON'T HAVE MY GIRLFRIEND AND I DON'T HAVE LOUIS 
REST IT ON THIS IT'S DRIPPING ALL OVER THE GAFF 
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN IT DOES GET HARD 
AT THE SAME TIME I CAN'T COMPLAIN 
I'M LIVING WITH MY THREE BEST FRIENDS

PORN MAG IT'S NOT MINE HONEST 
I'M GONNA BE WORKING PRETTY MUCH ALL NIGHT 
I'VE GOT A BREAK FROM TWELVE TO ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY 
WHICH WILL BE SPENT ON THE BUS GETTING TO THE NEXT CLUB 
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK FLASH BY NAME 
MEANS FLASH BY NATURE 
IN REALITY THAT'S NOT THE CASE 
I'VE NEVER BEEN PARTICULARLY FLASH 
I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW 
WHO THEIR NICKNAME DICTATES THEIR PERSONALITY 
ULTIMATELY IT'S A D. J. NAME ISN'T IT 
I'VE NEVER BEEN FLASH AND I DON'T THINK I EVER WILL BE 
I THINK IT'S JUST A GOOD NAME 
I HAVEN'T WASHED IT FOR A WEEK AND A HALF SO IT'S PRETTY HORRIBLE 
I COULD HAVE IT THAT'S PRETTY SICK 
THEY SAY YOU LOVE ME 
GOD I'M SO DEPRESSED 
DO YOU LIKE INDIE MUSIC

I WAS GETTING PAID A LOT OF MONEY AND I WAS LIKE COOL

COS IT WAS REALLY WHAT I WANTED TO DO 
SO NOW I MAKE NO MONEY BUT I'M DOING WHAT I LIKE 
I CAN'T IMAGINE ER

SHE'LL BE WALKING THE CATWALK AT NEW YORK'S FASHION WEEK 
IT'S SO EARLY 
NEW YORK FASHION WEEK'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST DEAL 
IT'S THE MOST INFLUENTIAL OF ALL THE FASHION WEEKS 
WHATEVER GIRLS ARE BOOKED FOR THE SHOWS 
THEY DO REALLY WELL IN ALL THE OTHER FASHION WEEKS 
IT'S GONNA CONSIST OF HAIR AND MAKE UP 
LOTS OF FAFFING AROUND 
AND ME DOING A WALK WHICH I THINK IS KIND OF RIDICULOUS 
I'VE BEEN DOING IT SINCE I WAS TWO IT SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT 
BUT YEAH I GET REALLY NERVOUS 
I DIDN'T FLASH MY UNDERWEAR DID I 
A NORMAL TEENAGER GETS LONELY I GET LONELY 
A NORMAL TEENAGER GETS TIRED I GET TIRED 
NORMAL TEENAGERS CRY OVER HEARTBREAKS I DO THAT TOO 
HOWEVER BECAUSE MOST NORMAL TEENAGERS 
DON'T HAVE TO FLY AROUND THE WORLD AS MUCH AS I DO 
I'M A LUCKY ONE 
THIS IS AMERICA'S LARGEST FASHION EVENT 
AND A PLATFORM FOR SOME OF THE WORLD'S TOP MODELS 
EXCUSE ME 
SO THESE ARE MY SHOES AND I WAS GIVEN THEM TODAY 
THEY'RE TOO BIG FOR ME WHICH IS KIND OF SCARY 
I FEEL A LITTLE BIT SICK 
I JUST WANT IT TO START NOW 
AND AFTER A PRACTICE WALK FOR THE DESIGNER 
YES A PRACTICE WALK 
I MISS HOME ENOUGH AS IT IS BUT YEAH 
NOT HAVING ANYONE THAT I REALLY KNOW HERE IS MAKING IT A BIT HARDER 
I CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND HAVING CHATS WITH LOADS OF FRIENDLY FACES 
BUT IT'S A NEW EXPERIENCE AND OBVIOUSLY 
IT MEANS THAT I'LL MAKE LOADS OF NEW FRIENDS HERE 
WHICH IS QUITE NICE

AND WILL'S BEDDING IN WITH THE BAND BUT I'M STILL LIVING HERE ON MY OWN
