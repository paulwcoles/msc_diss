FINDING THE RIGHT PROPERTIES IS ALWAYS TRICKY ON ESCAPE TO THE COUNTRY 
BUT TODAY I FACE POSSIBLY MY TRICKIEST SEARCH YET 
NOT ONLY AM I LOOKING IN ONE OF THE LEAST POPULATED PARTS OF WALES 
BUT MY FAMILY ALSO HAVE VERY SPECIFIC IDEAS OF THE SORT OF PROPERTY THEY'RE AFTER 
WELCOME TO CAERDYDD THAT'S CARDIFF TO THE NON WELSH SPEAKERS AMONGST YOU 
ONCE THE LARGEST COAL PORT IN THE WORLD AND SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE WALES' CAPITAL CITY 
WITH A POPULATION OF AROUND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND IT MIGHT BE THE SAME SIZE AS COVENTRY 
BUT IT'S STILL THE BIGGEST CITY IN WALES AND GETTING BIGGER 
NOT SURPRISINGLY PROPERTY PRICES IN WALES HAVE BOOMED 
TEN YEARS AGO THE AVERAGE COST OF A HOUSE IN CARDIFF WAS FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND 
TODAY IT'S ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND 
AND THERE'S A HISTORICAL SIDE OF THE CITY TOO 
BUILT IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE THIS INDOOR MARKET STILL CONJURES UP A SENSE OF LIFE TWO CENTURIES AGO 
AND IF YOU FANCY A TRADITIONAL SLICE OF THE CAPITAL THEN WHY NOT TRY A LOCAL DELICACY 
CAN I HAVE A WELSH CAKE THANK YOU 
MMM THIS LOOKS DELICIOUS 
BUT AFTER FOURTEEN YEARS IN THE CITY TODAY'S FAMILY ARE IN SEARCH 
OF SOMETHING EQUALLY TRADITIONAL IN WALES 
THEY WANT TO SWAP THE BUSTLING URBAN LANDSCAPE FOR GREEN VALLEYS AND SPECTACULAR HILL SCENERY 
THIS IS THE LLYWELYN FAMILY 
THIRTY ONE YEAR OLD DAD RHYS AND SON GRIFF WHO'S JUST SIXTEEN MONTHS OLD 
THEN THERE'S THIRTY SIX YEAR OLD GWYNETH ONCE PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHER NOW FULL TIME MUM 
THIS IS A FAMILY WHO ARE FANATICAL ABOUT WALES' NATIONAL SPORT 
WE'RE HUGE WELSH RUGBY FANS AND WE COME HERE REGULARLY 
TO THE MILLENNIUM STADIUM WE'RE REALLY GOING TO MISS IT WHEN WE MOVE TO THE COUNTRY 
WHEN WE MOVE TO NORTH WALES WE HOPE TO GET A BIT MORE LAND SO GRIFF CAN PRACTISE AND PLAY FOR WALES SOME DAY 
WELL MAYBE ONE DAY 
RHYS REELS IN THE FAMILY'S INCOME BY DOING WHAT HE ENJOYS MOST 
FISHING IS MY LIFE IN WORK I'M A FISHING MARKETING AND TRAINING OFFICER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY 
AND THE WALES TOURIST BOARD BUT ALSO OUTSIDE OF WORK I LOVE TO FISH 
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT I'M ACTUALLY FISHING IN THE CENTRE OF CARDIFF RIGHT NOW 
IT DOES GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO FISH FOR WILD BROWN TROUT AND GREY LING 
AND LIVE VERY CLOSE TO THE CITY 
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TO THE COUNTRY TO ENABLE ME TO FISH IN NICER SURROUNDINGS REALLY 
IN DEEP VALLEYS AND IN MOUNTAIN LAKES 
THAT WOULD BE MY LOVE 
RHYS AND GWYNETH BOUGHT THEIR HOUSE THREE YEARS AGO FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND 
SINCE THEN THEY'VE INSTALLED CENTRAL HEATING CONVERTED ONE BEDROOM INTO TWO AND FITTED NEW WINDOWS 
IT'S CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET FOR TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND SO IF THEY GET THEIR ASKING PRICE 
THEY'LL MAKE OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND 
THROUGH THE DOOR TURNING LEFT FROM THE HALLWAY IS AN OPEN PLAN 
LIVING AREA WITH A VICTORIAN FIREPLACE AS ITS CENTREPIECE 
OUT OF THE LIVING ROOM BACK THROUGH THE HALLWAY LEADS 
TO THE IMPRESSIVELY SIZED KITCHEN WITH A PARTICULARLY BEAUTIFUL ORIGINAL VICTORIAN DRESSER 
UP THE STAIRS ARE THE SLEEPING QUARTERS 
FIRST UP IS AN AMPLE SIZED DOUBLE BEDROOM OVERLOOKING THE BACK GARDEN 
DOWN THE CORRIDOR ON THE RIGHT WE FIND RHYS' STUDY ROOM 
FURTHER ALONG IS A SMALL FAMILY BATHROOM 
BEDROOM NUMBER TWO IS CURRENTLY BEING USED AS GRIFF'S NURSERY 
AND COMES COMPLETE WITH ANOTHER PERIOD FIREPLACE CURRENTLY INHABITED BY A TEDDY BEAR 
AND FINALLY THE ALL IMPORTANT MASTER BEDROOM WHICH 
LIKE THE REST OF THE HOUSE HAS THE ORIGINAL VICTORIAN FLOORING INTACT 
RHYS AND GWYNETH I HEAR YOU'VE GOT SOME VERY GOOD NEWS FOR ME ABOUT YOUR HOUSE HERE 
YEAH WE'VE MANAGED TO SELL UM SO THAT'S VERY GOOD NEWS FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW 
SO HOW MUCH DID YOU GET TWO HUNDRED SEVEN THOUSAND 
RIGHT SO HOW MUCH DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU'VE MADE ON IT 
A FAIR BIT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT EIGHTY 
YES JUST OVER EIGHTY IS IT EIGHTY FIVE YES 
EIGHTY FIVE FANTASTIC AND I TAKE IT YOU'RE PRETTY PLEASED WITH THAT 
VERY PLEASED YES YES DEFINITELY SO FIRST OF ALL TELL ME EXACTLY WHERE YOU'D LIKE TO MOVE TO 
WE'RE LOOKING BASICALLY MAINLY BASING AROUND DOLGELLAU AN AREA OF MID WALES WE PARTICULARLY LIKE 
OF COURSE THE CLOCK IS TICKING ISN'T IT TO GET YOU THERE 
YES BECAUSE OUR NEXT BABY'S DUE IN FOUR MONTHS' TIME 
LET'S MAKE A LIST OF EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED START WITH THE BASICS 
HOW MANY BEDROOMS DO YOU NEED GWYNETH 
FOUR BEDROOMS MINIMUM 
WE'VE GOT A VERY SMALL BATHROOM AT THE MOMENT SO WE WOULD IDEALLY LIKE A GOOD FAMILY SIZED BATHROOM 
UM A BONUS WOULD BE A UTILITY ROOM OR A DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM 
AND RHYS YOU WORK FROM HOME A LITTLE BIT 
DO YOU NEED AN OFFICE SPACE 
UM I CAN WORK A FEW DAYS A WEEK FROM HOME SO IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR ME 
TO HAVE A SPACE UM WHERE I WOULDN'T BE BOTHERED BY LITTLE CHILDREN 
EXACTLY HOW MUCH OUTSIDE SPACE WOULD YOU LIKE 
WE'RE THINKING OF MAYBE SETTING UP SOME SORT OF SELF CATERING HOLIDAY LET BUSINESS 
RIGHT AND IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE 
SCHOOL UM IT'S IMPORTANT TO US TO HAVE A SCHOOL NOT TOO FAR AWAY 
A WELSH SPEAKING SCHOOL AS WELL SO THE SCHOOL MUST BE WELSH SPEAKING 
YES DEFINITELY WE WANT TO RAISE GRIFF AND BABY NUMBER TWO BILINGUALLY BRILLIANT 
WELL I AM GOING TO HEAD OFF NOW 
SO THAT I CAN SHOW YOU FOUR REALLY GOOD OPTIONS 
I MIGHT JUST SNEAK A LITTLE BIT OUT OF THE BORDERS OF YOUR SEARCH AREA SO JUST KEEP AN OPEN MIND 
I KNOW THE CLOCK IS TICKING SO UM I HOPE THAT I WILL FIND YOU THE HOUSE OF YOUR DREAMS 
GET SEARCHING 
WELL THE LLYWELYNS DO HAVE A DECENT BUDGET OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO COMPETE 
WITH THEIR CURRENT HOME WHICH IS AN IMPRESSIVE SIZE AND PACKED WITH PERIOD FEATURES 
SO THE PRESSURE'S ON 
THE LLYWELYN FAMILY ARE AFTER A FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE PREFERABLY SET IN ITS OWN LAND 
A UTILITY ROOM AND OUTBUILDINGS WOULD BE A BONUS 
AND THAT'S NOT FORGETTING THE ALL IMPORTANT WELSH SPEAKING SCHOOL 
THE FOCUS OF MY SEARCH IS THE NORTH MID WALES BORDERS AN AREA RENOWNED FOR ITS STARK RUGGED BEAUTY 
FROM THE PLATEAUS OF THE CAMBRIAN MOUNTAINS 
TO THE STEEP VALLEYS AND HIGH PEAKS OF SNOWDONIA NATIONAL PARK 
BACK IN MEDIEVAL TIMES THIS FORMIDABLE LANDSCAPE ACTED AS A NATURAL FORTRESS PROVIDING 
REFUGE FOR THE WELSH TRIBAL ARMIES WHO WERE BATTLING AGAINST ENGLISH DOMINATION BY KING EDWARD I 
AND TODAY THE AREA CONTINUES TO OFFER REFUGE 
BUT NOWADAYS IT'S FROM CROWDS AND THE BUSTLE OF MODERN LIFE 
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST SPARSELY POPULATED REGIONS IN WALES AND IS BLISSFULLY QUIET 
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON THERE 
IT'S FAST DEVELOPING A REPUTATION AS THE ADVENTURE CAPITAL OF THE U. K. 
MORE THAN SIX MILLION VISITORS A YEAR 
ARE DRAWN TO THE ARRAY OF OUTDOOR PURSUITS THE AREA HAS TO OFFER 
MY SEARCH BEGINS IN BONT DOLGADFAN NESTLED IN THE CAMBRIAN MOUNTAINS 
THIS PRETTY HAMLET IS TINY SO THERE ARE NO SERVICES TO SPEAK OF APART FROM A POST BOX AND PUB 
YSGOLDRE WHICH MEANS TOWN SCHOOL 
IS A FOUR BEDROOM FAMILY HOME THAT'S ON THE MARKET FOR THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND 
IT'S SLIGHTLY OUT OF THE LLYWELYNS' SEARCH AREA BUT IT COMES WITH A POND 
A STABLE BLOCK AND ALMOST THREE ACRES OF LAND THAT'S CURRENTLY HOME TO A RATHER COLOURFUL MENAGERIE 
MEANWHILE IN CARDIFF THE LLYWELYNS ARE WATCHING MY VIEWINGS VIA THE LAPTOP 
THAT'S NICE OH 
HELLO PAUL I'D SPOTTED THAT THIS FAMILY ARE HORSE MAD BECAUSE OF THE STABLES 
BUT THEY'RE DOUBLING UP WITH A TACK ROOM HERE IN THE HALLWAY 
UM AND JUST LOOKING UP IT'S GOT LOADS OF CHARACTER 
YES THEY'VE DONE QUITE A LOT OF RENOVATION HERE 
IN THE LAST THREE YEARS EXCELLENT 
SHALL WE START THROUGH HERE FIRST 
WE'VE GOT A LITTLE SITTING ROOM HERE 
I'D LIKE TO HAVE AN ENTRANCE IT WOULD BE QUITE NICE YES 
SOMEWHERE TO PUT THE COATS BOOTS 
I'D SORT OF MENTALLY PENCILLED THAT THIS COULD POSSIBLY BE AN OFFICE FOR RHYS YEAH 
WHO DOES WORK FROM HOME AND ON A SUMMER DAY HE CAN HAVE THAT OPEN CAN'T HE 
HIS LITTLE BOY CAN COME AND BOTHER HIM ALL THE TIME 
YES I THINK THAT'S NOT ON THE PLAN ACTUALLY 
SO THERE'S A SHOWER ROOM NEXT DOOR YES 
IT'S VERY SORT OF DRAMATIC DECORATION 
HAS THIS BEEN PUT IN RECENTLY IN THE LAST THREE YEARS 
GOOD GRIEF PLAY CHESS ON THE FLOOR 
SO WE'RE SORT OF COMING BACK THROUGH THE HOUSE AND HAVE A 
LOOK UPSTAIRS IN A MINUTE BUT WE'LL CONTINUE EXPLORING DOWN HERE AH 
SO SLIGHTLY UNEXPECTED WE'VE GOT ANOTHER BATHROOM 
THIS IS THE MAIN BATHROOM IT'S NICE TO HAVE A BATH 
AS WELL AS A SHOWER DO YOU THINK THERE'LL BE ONE UPSTAIRS OR THEY ALL DOWNSTAIRS I DON'T KNOW 
O. K. SO THE MAIN BATHROOM IS DOWNSTAIRS 
MM HMM AND IT'S ALSO NEXT DOOR TO ANOTHER BATHROOM 
YEAH YOU CAN NEVER HAVE TOO MANY TOILETS 
TRUE BUT YOU CAN ALSO NEVER HAVE TOO MUCH STORAGE FOR EXAMPLE 
NO SO WE MIGHT HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE WE'LL SEE WHAT MY FAMILY THINK 
BIT FUNNY HAVING TWO BATHROOMS NEXT TO EACH OTHER ISN'T IT YES 
CONVENIENT FOR THE PLUMBER AND NO ONE ELSE I SUPPOSE 
OOH FINALLY WE'VE FOUND A LIVING ROOM AND IT'S RATHER AMAZING 
WELL THIS WAS THE MAIN SCHOOL ROOM OF COURSE SO THAT'S WHY THEY'VE KEPT THE TALL WINDOW 
YES THAT'S AMAZING 
THAT'S A NICE LIGHT ROOM IT'S QUITE BIG 
SO WE'LL CARRY ON NEXT DOOR 
OH WOW VERY COLOURFUL KITCHEN 
IT'S STUNNING ACTUALLY I LIKE THE BELFAST SINK AND THE WORK TOPS 
ROOM FOR THE TABLE YEAH 
OBVIOUSLY NOT A SCHOOL AT THE MOMENT SO WHERE WOULD MY FAMILY'S CHILDREN 
GO TO THE NEAREST WELSH SPEAKING SCHOOL 
IT'S ABOUT THREE MILES AND THEY GET PICKED UP WITH A LOCAL TAXI 
TAXI SERVICE BRILLIANT 
UM AND THEN WHAT HAVE WE GOT DOWN HERE BEHIND ME PAUL 
THAT JUST TAKES US STRAIGHT THROUGH THE UTILITY ROOM STRAIGHT OUTSIDE 
WHAT YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED A UTILITY ROOM 
ALL THE WASHING CAN GO IN THERE IT'S A REALLY NICE UTILITY ROOM 
THERE ARE JUST UNDER THREE ACRES OF LAND HERE 
THE CURRENT OWNERS ARE HORSE MAD SO IT'S PRETTY MUCH SET UP FOR EQUINE ADVENTURES 
UM IF SHE'S SET ON HER LOG CABIN IDEA IT'S SOMETHING THE CURRENT OWNERS HAD ALREADY THOUGHT OF 
SO THERE'S A LEVEL PIECE OF LAND WHERE YOU COULD BUILD THEM 
AND THEY'VE PUT IN A SEPARATE DRIVE ACCESS SO IT'S ALL SET UP AND READY TO GO M. M. M. THAT'S GOOD 
THAT'S VERY GOOD YEAH M. M. M. YEAH 
THAT'S JUST FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE HOUSE IT'S NOT ON THE DOORSTEP 
IT WOULD SAVE US A LOT OF WORK 
AND UPSTAIRS WE'VE GOT FOUR BEDROOMS THE FIRST OF WHICH IS 
THE MASTER BEDROOM WHICH IS REMARKABLE FOR TWO THINGS 
THE FIRST IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY 
CAREFUL NOT TO CONCUSS YOURSELF ON THIS RATHER DRAMATIC CROSSBEAM 
DO YOU THINK YOU'D GET UNDERNEATH THE BEAMS THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM 
THE BED'S OVER THERE TUCKED UNDER THE SLOPE OF THE CEILING 
THE OTHER SLIGHTLY REMARKABLE THING IS THIS LITTLE AREA 
NOW ON THE DETAILS IT'S BILLED AS AN EN SUITE BATHROOM BUT THERE'S 
CERTAINLY NOTHING ON OR SWEET ABOUT IT IT'S SORT OF REALLY OPEN PLAN 
YOU COULD START SLEEPWALKING AND END UP IN THE BATH 
M. M. M. 
IT'S A BIT BIZARRE 
NEXT DOOR IS BEDROOM TWO 
NOW THAT REALLY IS FAIRLY TINY BUT IT WOULD BE PERFECT FOR THE NEW BABY AND UM THEN IN HERE 
THIS IS BEDROOM THREE 
NOW IT'S ACTUALLY NOT A BAD SIZE 
YOU COULD SQUEEZE A SMALL DOUBLE BED IN HERE IF YOU WANTED TO 
BUT IT WOULD BE PERFECT FOR ONE OF THE CHILDREN 
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD ROOM FOR GRIFF WOULDN'T IT YEAH 
AND THEN FINALLY 
OVER THIS SIDE OF THE HOUSE THIS IS BEDROOM FOUR AND THIS REALLY IS RATHER DRAMATIC 
IT'S GOT TWO WINDOWS ONE OF THEM IS FLOOR LEVEL AND THEN THIS REALLY POINTY ROOF 
AND IT'S CERTAINLY GOT CHARACTER 
WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS MY FAMILY WERE ADAMANT THAT THEY WANTED 
THAT'S NICE I PREFER THAT TO THE OTHER ONE YEAH SO MAKE THE OTHER A GUEST BEDROOM AND WE'LL HAVE THIS 
YSGOLDRE IS A FOUR BEDROOM RURAL HOME WITH A RANGE OF OUTBUILDINGS 
ITS GENEROUS PLOT AND SEPARATE DRIVEWAY ACCESS 
OFFERS PLENTY OF SCOPE FOR RHYS AND GWYNETH'S HOLIDAY LETS IDEA 
THERE'S CHARACTER AND PRACTICALITY TO THINK OF AND I THINK THAT'S GOT 
TOO MUCH CHARACTER AND NOT ENOUGH PRACTICALITY I LIKE WHERE IT'S SITUATED 
YEAH VERY NICE POSITION AND NICE TO HAVE THE LAND 
LOVELY KITCHEN 
UTILITY ROOM LOTS OF THE BOXES HAVE BEEN TICKED 
I'VE TRAVELLED JUST TWO AND A HALF MILES NORTH TO THE VILLAGE OF LLANBRYNMAIR 
AND I'VE BROUGHT THE RAINY WEATHER WITH ME 
IT HAS A SHOP A PUB AND A WELSH SPEAKING PRIMARY SCHOOL WHICH SHOULD PLEASE MY FAMILY 
AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH IT ALSO HAS A QUIRKY RABBIT VILLAGE 
I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT MY NEXT PROPERTY HAS CONSIDERABLY LARGER DIMENSIONS THAN THESE 
GLYNDWR IS A TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD WELSH STONE HOUSE THAT HAS HAD SEVERAL USES OVER THE YEARS 
IT WAS ORIGINALLY A FARMHOUSE THEN A GAMEKEEPER'S LODGE 
AND FOR A WHILE IT SERVED AS THE LOCAL POLICE STATION 
THAT'S NICE OH IT IS NICE 
TODAY IT'S A NEWLY RENOVATED FAMILY HOME AND IS ON THE MARKET FOR TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
OWNER BRIAN MCKENZIE IS SHOWING ME AROUND 
YOU COME INTO THIS REALLY BIG PRACTICAL LOBBY SPACE 
WE CALL IT OUR BOOT ROOM WATERPROOF FLOOR 
GOOD FOR THE YOU KNOW DIRTY STUFF KICK OFF YOUR BOOTS AND STUFF 
PLENTY OF BOOTS AS WELL IT'S HUGE ISN'T IT OH YEAH 
PLENTY OF SPACE THERE WE CAN PUT A CUPBOARD IN AND HOOKS AND THINGS 
YEAH YEAH GREAT GOOD START 
SO UM YOU HAVE GOT OTHER ROOMS ON THIS FLOOR YES WE'VE GOT A ROOM THROUGH HERE 
OH OH SO IT'S GOT A VERY IMPRESSIVE FIREPLACE AND NOT MUCH ELSE 
IS THIS YOUR SOLITARY CONTEMPLATION ROOM 
WHEN WE RENOVATED THE HOUSE WE WERE LOOKING AT POSSIBLY DOING THIS INTO 
A FLAT DOWNSTAIRS BY KNOCKING THROUGH UNDERNEATH THE STAIRS 
WE COULD HAVE THE OPTION OF MAKING DOWNSTAIRS INTO A LETTING UNIT 
YEAH RIGHT SO BACK ACROSS THE ACRES OF BOOT ROOM 
THAT'S RIGHT YES 
OOH SO GOSH WE REALLY ARE RIGHT DOWN IN THE DEPTHS OF THE HOUSE HERE 
THE HOUSE USED TO BE AN OLD POLICE HOUSE AND THIS WAS THE CELLS 
YEAH FISHING EQUIPMENT YES 
SO THIS IS THE START OF WHAT YOU'RE USING AS YOUR HOME 
THAT'S CORRECT YEAH WE'RE COMING INTO THIS LIVING AREA NOW YEAH 
OH LOVELY SITTING ROOM 
YEAH THIS IS OUR LIVING AREA I LIKE THAT ROOM 
YEAH IT'S A VERY NICE ROOM MMM 
SO WHAT'S THROUGH THIS DOOR HERE IT'S A STABLE DOOR OUT TO THE GARDEN 
OH RIGHT LOVELY SO IN THE SUMMER YOU CAN OPEN THIS UP 
ABSOLUTELY YEAH GET A NICE BIT OF AIRFLOW 
THAT'S NICE THAT'S VERY NICE TO HAVE A GARDEN THERE 
RIGHT SO WE'RE SORT OF COMING BACK ACROSS YOUR LOVELY BIG HALLWAY 
YEAH THE REST OF THE LIVING ACCOMMODATION'S ON THIS SIDE IS IT 
YEAH WE'VE GOT A DINING ROOM THROUGH THIS DOOR HERE 
OOH THERE WE ARE OH I SEE YOU'VE SORT OF GOT TWO DOORS NEXT TO EACH OTHER THERE 
YEAH WE HAVE YEAH IF WE WANT A COSIER SPACE WE CAN CLOSE THAT ONE OFF IF NEED BE 
RIGHT I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN 
YEAH VERY NICELY PRESENTED 
FINISH LOOKS VERY NICE M. M. M. THEY'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME HAVEN'T THEY AND CARE 
THIS IS A REALLY PLEASANT ROOM YOU'RE USING IT AS A DINING ROOM 
YES WE ARE YEAH UM SO IT'S SORT OF SEMI OPEN PLAN TO YOUR KITCHEN REALLY 
YEAH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS RATHER LOVELY THING IS THIS AN ORIGINAL FEATURE 
NO THAT CAME FROM A BARN IN SOUTH HEREFORDSHIRE 
YEAH SO WE RECLAIMED IT FROM THERE 
I THOUGHT IT WAS FROM A BARN 
IT'S NICE I LIKE THAT EFFECT IT LIKE IT 
UM SO THIS WOULD ACTUALLY WORK REALLY WELL 
BECAUSE GWYNETH REALLY FANCIES HAVING A KITCHEN THAT SHE CAN BE IN BUT THE CHILDREN CAN BE WITH HER 
YEAH BECAUSE YOU'VE ALSO GOT SPACE FOR YOUR TABLE HERE 
ABSOLUTELY NICE CLEAN LIGHT 
LOOKS VERY TIDY THERE DO THEY ACTUALLY LIVE THERE YEAH 
SO IT'S SORT OF AN L. SHAPE REALLY 
NOW WHAT'S THROUGH HERE IN THIS ROOM 
RIGHT THROUGH HERE IT'S OUR UTILITY ROOM AND BOILER ROOM SO YEAH 
OH RIGHT EXCELLENT 
SO THERE'S A UTILITY ROOM VERY GOOD 
I THINK THEY DO LIVE THERE 
THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE THEY'VE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF CLUTTER 
SO OUTSIDE WE'RE AT THE BACK OF THE PROPERTY HERE 
NOW IT'S A FAIRLY SMALL GARDEN ADMITTEDLY ALTHOUGH THERE IS QUITE A BIG SPACE AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
I'D BE A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT GOING INTO THE FRONT ROOM WITH WELLINGTONS 
BUT THEN THEY COULD COME IN THAT WAY YEAH GREAT NICE 
NOW OUTSIDE WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF LITTLE STABLES WHICH I HAVE KIND OF MENTALLY 
PENCILLED MIGHT BE POTENTIAL OFFICE SPACES FOR RHYS BUT ACTUALLY HAVING SEEN THEM THEY'RE PRETTY TINY 
THERE'S ALSO A LITTLE SHED ACROSS THE WAY 
ALL USED TO BE GOAT HOUSES BUT NOW COULD BE GOOD KAYAK STORAGE 
SHE OBVIOUSLY HASN'T SEEN THE SIZE OF MY KAYAK IT WOULDN'T FIT 
SO THERE ARE FOUR BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS 
PROBABLY WORTH POINTING OUT THAT THIS IS NOW THE SECOND FLOOR SO THAT'S TWO FLIGHTS OF STAIRS 
JUST BEAR THAT IN MIND WITH SMALL CHILDREN 
FIRST ROOM WE COME TO IS THE FAMILY BATHROOM 
A FAIRLY DECENT SIZE ROOM 
THAT'S A NICE BATHROOM M. M. M. 
NICE AND BIG IT'S ALL NEWLY DONE ISN'T IT 
VERY CLEAN I LIKE THE TAPS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BATH 
AND THEN ACROSS THE HALLWAY IS THE FIRST OF THE FOUR BEDROOMS 
IT'S A GOOD SIZED DOUBLE IT'S AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND THEN NEXT DOOR IS WHAT WOULD PROBABLY BE YOUR 
GUEST BEDROOM AND YOU LOOK OUT OVER A LITTLE FIELD AND THEN TO A RIVER BURBLING AWAY AT THE BOTTOM OF IT SO 
REALLY GOOD FISHING INSPIRATION FOR RHYS 
DO I NEED INSPIRATION YOU'VE JUST TAKEN THE WORDS OUT OF MY MOUTH 
RHYS DOESN'T NEED INSPIRATION FOR FISHING CATHERINE 
NEXT UP IS THE SMALLEST OF THE BEDROOMS 
YOU COULD ACTUALLY SQUEEZE A DOUBLE BED IN THERE BUT IT WOULD BE PERFECT FOR ONE OF THE CHILDREN 
BUT THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
SO THIS IS A GOOD SIZE ROOM AND SO THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE HERE 
IS THAT WHAT WAS THE FIFTH BEDROOM HAS BEEN MADE INTO AN ABSOLUTELY SPLENDID EN SUITE BATHROOM 
SO YOU'VE GOT FAMILY BATHING POTENTIAL HERE 
OF THE KIND THAT THE LLYWELYNS AT THE MOMENT CAN ONLY DREAM OF 
THAT IS A LOVELY BATHROOM IT IS 
IT'S REALLY NICE PLENTY OF ROOM 
STILL TO COME ON ESCAPE TO THE COUNTRY 
WILL RHYS AND GWYNETH PICK A READY MADE HOME OR A DIY CHALLENGE 
A BIT PRICEY 
UM I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE THERE AS WELL 
AS THEY'RE BOWLED OVER BY ONE OF MY PROPERTIES 
WE DO LIKE THIS PROPERTY THERE'S NO TWO WAYS ABOUT IT IT'S LOVELY 
MY NEXT PROPERTY IS SITUATED IN MALLWYD 
RIGHT IN THE CENTRE OF THEIR PREFERRED LOCATION IN THE PRIME FISHING TERRITORY 
OF THE DYFI RIVER VALLEY WHICH SHOULD BE MUSIC TO RHYS' EARS 
AND JUST TWO MILES OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE IS MY NEXT PROPERTY 
NOW GWYNETH AND RHYS WERE HOPING FOR A COUPLE OF ACRES OF LAND WITH THEIR NEW HOME 
WELL THIS ONE COMES WITH NOT TWO ACRES BUT THIRTY SIX AND THESE FABULOUS VIEWS 
Y. R. ALLT IS A TRADITIONAL STONE FARMHOUSE 
IT COMES WITH LAND AND OUTBUILDINGS AND IS ON THE MARKET FOR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
THE TOP OF GWYNETH AND RHYS' BUDGET 
OH NICE BIG PARKING AREA 
YEAH PLENTY OF OUTHOUSES 
I LIKE THE SETTING 
AWESTA VAUGHN HAS LIVED IN THE PROPERTY SINCE SHE WAS A CHILD AND IS GOING TO SHOW ME AROUND 
WE'RE COMING THROUGH YOUR BACK DOOR IS THAT RIGHT YES 
AND THIS LOVELY BIG KITCHEN THIS IS FANTASTIC 
LOVELY I WONDER IF THAT TAKES UP MOST OF THE GROUND FLOOR 
AND HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU SPEND IN THIS ROOM 
A LOT OF TIME YES 
MOST OF THE TIME RIGHT 
SO IT'S SORT OF A KIND OF YOUR REAL LIVING SPACE YES 
O. K. PARTLY BECAUSE OF THIS 
I GUESS YOUR LOVELY RAYBURN 
YES WARMING THE HOUSE M. M. M. YES IT'S VERY VERY HANDY 
VERY GOOD COOKER THAT'S GOOD 
THAT'S NICE I LIKE THAT THERE'S A NICE HOMELY FEEL TO IT M. M. M. 
AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE GOT OTHER LIVING ROOMS YES WE HAVE YES 
SO LET'S HEAD OFF AND HAVE A LOOK AT THOSE 
OH NOW I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU WHAT YOU USE THIS ROOM FOR 
YOU'VE GOT A DESK A THREE PIECE SUITE AND A DINING TABLE AND CHAIRS IN HERE YES 
WE DON'T USE A LOT OF IT NOW WE USED TO USE IT A LOT WHEN THE KIDS WERE SMALL 
THEY USED TO BE HERE AND I'VE A TELEVISION HERE 
IT'S A TABLE LIKE OURS WE CAN FIT OURS INSTEAD OF IT THAT'S GREAT 
AHA SO WE'VE FINALLY REACHED THE FRONT DOOR YES WE HAVE YES 
AND THIS IS YOUR ENTRANCE HALL 
WHAT'S IN HERE IT'S A PANTRY THE OLD FASHIONED PANTRY REALLY 
THEY USED TO SALT PIGS AND THINGS IN THERE 
I'M NOT GOING TO BE SALTING PIGS IN THERE 
BUT UM NO A HANDY LITTLE ROOM 
GUTTING FISH IN THERE YEAH MAYBE 
AND THERE'S THE STAIRS I'LL COME BACK TO THOSE 
SO NOW WE'RE RIGHT AT THE FAR END OF THE HOUSE HERE YES WE ARE YES 
OOH IN THE SNOOKER ROOM YES IN THE SNOOKER ROOM THIS IS WHERE THE GRANDCHILDREN PLAY 
I USED IT AS A PLAYROOM 
PIANO 
VERY GOOD SO OUR PIANO WOULD FIT IN THERE BECAUSE IT LOOKS THE SAME KIND OF STYLE AS OUR PIANO 
AND WHAT'S THROUGH HERE WELL THAT'S A LOBBY 
OH I SEE YES IT WAS IS THIS IS A PARTITION YES IT IS 
I THINK WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS GO THAT WAY ISN'T IT YES AND MAKE ONE BIG ONE BIG ROOM 
IT WOULD BE PERFECT FOR THE CHILDREN YES 
THERE WASN'T AN ACTUAL DOOR THERE THERE WAS JUST A CURTAIN 
SO THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF MAKING IT INTO ONE ROOM 
SO UPSTAIRS 
PREPARE YOURSELF FOR THE FACT IT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF IMAGINATION 
SO FIRST UP IS A LITTLE BOX ROOM REALLY BUT THERE IS SPACE FOR A SINGLE BED IN THERE 
IT WOULD BE PERFECT FOR ONE OF THE CHILDREN 
NURSERY I WAS GOING TO SAY HOPEFULLY THAT'S THE SMALLEST ROOM SO THAT WOULD BE THE NURSERY 
I THINK I CAN SAFELY SAY 
THAT WE'VE GOT CARPETS AND WALLPAPER FROM PRETTY WELL EVERY ERA HERE UM SO JUST THINK LOTS OF EMULSION 
THAT'S NO PROBLEM IS IT NO 
COAT OF PAINT AND IT'LL BE A DIFFERENT ROOM 
NOW BACK AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS ON THE CENTRAL LANDING HERE 
THIS LITTLE DOOR GOES UP A RICKETY LITTLE STAIRCASE TO THE ATTIC WHICH RUNS THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE HOUSE 
SO CARRYING ON ON THIS FLOOR THE NEXT THING WE COME TO IS ANOTHER SINGLE BEDROOM 
NOW AS YOU CAN SEE THE DOOR ACTUALLY DOESN'T PARTICULARLY OPEN WITH THE BED IN THERE 
SO THERE IS LIMITED ROOM IN THERE 
MAYBE THAT'LL BE BETTER FOR THE BABY 
CLOSER TO THE MAIN BEDROOM AND GRIFF IN THE OTHER ONE 
AND THEN FROM HERE THIS IS THE POINT WHERE YOU REALLY NEED TO USE 
YOUR IMAGINATION BECAUSE IT ALL BECOMES VERY HIGGLEDY PIGGLEDY NOW THIS IS SLIGHTLY ODD 
AT SOME STAGE THIS ROOM WHICH PROBABLY WOULD BE YOUR MASTER BEDROOM HAS BEEN PARTITIONED 
VERY EASY TO TAKE THAT OUT AND YOU'D END UP WITH A REALLY GOOD SIZE ROOM 
THAT'S VERY STRANGE 
I WONDER IF THERE'S PLUMBING THERE WE COULD MAKE IT AN EN SUITE 
NOW THIS IS WHERE THE PROBLEMS START BECAUSE YOU COME THROUGH HERE TO THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE 
AND THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN ACCESS THIS AT THE MOMENT IS THROUGH THE MASTER BEDROOM 
FIRST OF ALL THERE'S A LITTLE ROOM THROUGH HERE 
I'M NOT ENTIRELY WHAT PURPOSE IT SERVES APART FROM THE FACT THAT AWISTA'S RECENTLY PUT A SHOWER IN 
HANDY TO HAVE A SHOWER I SUPPOSE BUT A BIT OF A WASTE OF A ROOM BY THE LOOKS OF IT M. M. M. 
NEXT DOOR THIS IS THE ONLY BATHROOM 
AND OF COURSE THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET TO IT IS BY COMING THROUGH THE MASTER BEDROOM 
IDEALLY YOU WANT TO PUT THAT BATHROOM IN ONE OF THE BEDROOMS MAYBE 
ONE OF THE SMALLER BEDROOMS YES 
BUT THEN AGAIN WE'RE HAVING A SMALL BATHROOM WHICH IS SOMETHING 
I REALLY WAS HOPING TO HAVE A BIG FAMILY BATHROOM 
NOW ONE OF THE REAL SELLING POINTS OF THIS PROPERTY IS WHAT LIES 
OUTSIDE SO THERE'S LOADS OF POTENTIAL 
FIRST OF ALL THERE'S AN OLD GRANARY ON THE END 
WHICH YOU COULD INCORPORATE INTO THE LIVING ACCOMMODATION 
AT THE FAR SIDE OF THE BUILDING THERE ARE TWO STONE BARNS 
WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY BE CONVERTED AND THEN THERE'S THE LAND 
NOW I KNOW RHYS AND GWYNETH WILL LOVE THIS SITUATION 
BECAUSE THE HOUSE SITS IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS OWN TERRITORY ALL THIRTY SIX ACRES OF IT 
I JUST THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH EVEN BUYING ALL THE LAND 
AND THEN YOU CAN YOU CAN DETERMINE WHO YOU WANT TO SELL IT TO THEN 
THAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY AROUND IT MAYBE 
THIS TRADITIONAL FARMHOUSE HAS LOTS OF ORIGINAL FEATURES 
IT REQUIRES SOME IMAGINATIVE RENOVATION BUT IT COMES WITH ACRES 
OF FARMLAND AND IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LLYWELYNS' SEARCH AREA 
THE LAST STOP ON MY SEARCH IS THE LITTLE HAMLET OF CEINWS 
FOUR MILES NORTH OF THE MARKET TOWN OF MACHYNLLETH 
PLAS RHIWGWREIDDYN IS A FIVE BEDROOM STONE HOUSE THAT COMES WITH 
JUST OVER TWO ACRES OF GROUNDS INCLUDING ITS OWN WOODLAND AREA 
BEAUTIFULLY RENOVATED IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND 
I LIKE THE LOOK OF THIS ONE 
IT LOOKS NICE DOESN'T IT LOVELY STONE 
THE OWNER'S MOTHER MERLE FISHER HAS AGREED TO SHOW ME AROUND 
HELLO MERLE HELLO CATHERINE 
IT'S NOT THE BEST DAY FOR IT BUT YOU'VE GOT A LOVELY LITTLE PORCH TO SHELTER UNDER 
VERY USEFUL BEFORE WE GO INSIDE CAN WE HAVE A LOOK AT WHERE ALL THE LAND IS 
BECAUSE THERE'S SOME WOODLAND ISN'T THERE 
AT THE BACK OF HOUSE RIGHT BLUEBELL WOOD 
NO IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURS BY THE LOOKS OF THINGS NO 
YOU'RE KIND OF OVERLOOKING YOUR NEIGHBOUR DOWN THERE YEAH 
RIGHT SO IN WE COME 
OH WHAT A LOVELY WIDE HALLWAY MERLE 
YES SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR STAIRCASE THERE OBVIOUSLY BUT WHAT'S IN HERE FIRST OF ALL RIGHT 
THAT'S A SITTING ROOM CUM LIBRARY 
LOVE THE BOOKSHELVES IT'S A REALLY GOOD SIZE BUT THERE'S ANOTHER SITTING ROOM ISN'T THERE YES 
TWO SITTING ROOMS SO ONE COULD BE AN OFFICE OR ONE COULD BE A PLAYROOM A PLAYROOM 
SO THIS IS THE DINING ROOM 
AMAZING WALLS I NOTICED THESE IN THE HALLWAY 
THEY'RE THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE ARE THEY YES 
THAT'S NICE 
ANOTHER FIREPLACE THERE 
SEEING THE PATIO DOORS IN THE SUMMER THAT YOU COULD OPEN THEM OUT YES OH YES EXCELLENT 
WELL LET'S CARRY ON THROUGH WHAT'S THE ROOM HERE THROUGH HERE 
OH NOW THIS IS A VERY GOOD SIZE ROOM 
ONE OF GWYNETH'S REQUIREMENTS IS THAT SHE CAN HAVE A KITCHEN THAT SHE CAN SPEND TIME WITH THE FAMILY IN 
IT'S A GOOD SIZE KITCHEN ISN'T IT 
YEAH NICE AND AIRY AS WELL 
YEAH LOVELY VERY GOOD 
WE'RE BACK INTO THE CENTRE OF THE HOUSE HERE YES 
SO THIS GOES TOWARDS THE BACK 
UH HUH IT'S A LOVELY SPACIOUS HALLWAY WHAT HAVE WE GOT IN HERE 
WELL JUST UNDER THE STAIRS FOR IRONING BOARD ETCETERA 
BRILLIANT THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF STUFF SO YES ALL STORAGE IS VERY WELCOME 
ROUND THE CORNER WE'VE GOT A LITTLE DOOR WHAT'S IN HERE MERLE 
OH RIGHT O. K. VERY NEWLY FITTED OBVIOUSLY 
DEFINITELY IT'S A BONUS TO HAVE A TOILET DOWNSTAIRS 
YEAH BATHROOM EVEN BETTER GREAT 
RIGHT OOH SO NOW WE'VE GOT BEAMS IN HERE 
YES WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE THE ROOMS ARE SO HIGH 
YES BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THE CHARACTER BUT NOT THE HEAD BANGING POTENTIAL 
I REALLY LIKE THAT 
NICE FIREPLACE NICE WOODEN FLOOR STONEWORK 
NOW THERE AREN'T ANY EXISTING OUTBUILDINGS WITH THIS PROPERTY 
AND ALTHOUGH THERE'S QUITE A BIG GARDEN PART OF IT IS ON A FAIRLY STEEP BANK HERE 
IT'S GOT POSSIBILITIES THOUGH IT HAS YES IT'S GOT A BIT OF LAND THERE 
SO THERE'S A LOVELY OLD WOODEN STAIRCASE THAT WAS PRESERVED FROM THE HOUSE 
THERE ARE FIVE BEDROOMS ALTOGETHER 
THIS IS THE FIRST OF THEM IT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY PLEASANT ROOM 
THAT'S NICE LOVELY 
LOTS OF HEAD ROOM THERE ISN'T THERE 
YEAH AGAIN THERE'S TWO WINDOWS 
LOTS OF LIGHT I LIKE THAT 
THIS IS THE SMALLEST OF THE BEDROOMS 
DEFINITELY A SINGLE OR AS YOU CAN SEE THEY'VE GOT BUNK BEDS 
AND THEN THIS IS BILLED AS A SUITE OF ROOMS 
SO THIS IS THE UPSTAIRS BATHROOM 
ALTHOUGH IT HASN'T ACTUALLY GOT A BATH IN IT 
JUST A SHOWER BUT IT'S STILL A VERY GOOD SIZE REALLY NICELY FITTED 
THIS WAS SORT OF DEEMED TO BE A DRESSING ROOM ALTHOUGH THE CURRENT OWNERS ARE USING IT AS A STUDY 
THAT'S NICE VERY NICE ISN'T IT 
M. M. M. PLENTY OF ROOM THERE YEAH 
IT LEADS THROUGH INTO A BEDROOM WHICH YOU WOULD THINK WOULD BE THE MASTER SUITE 
BUT ACTUALLY THIS ISN'T THE BIGGEST OF THE BEDROOMS 
IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE SMALL AND IT HAS A SLOPING CEILING 
SO IT'S A BIT RESTRICTED ON THE HEAD HEIGHT 
THAT WOULD BE NICE WHETHER YOU COULD SORT OF LET THAT AS A UNIT 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE'S ACCESS TO IT INDEPENDENT ACCESS TO JUST THOSE THREE ROOMS 
BECAUSE YOU'D HAVE THE BATHROOM THE BEDROOM AND ANOTHER ROOM 
SO THIS IS NOW THE FOURTH BEDROOM AND IT'S A REALLY GOOD SIZE 
GREAT HEAD HEIGHT NO WORRIES ABOUT BANGING YOUR HEAD ON THE CEILING HERE 
THIS PROPERTY REALLY DOES SEEM TO GO ON AND ON IT'S LIKE A SORT OF RAMBLING WARREN OF ROOMS 
SO THAT'S YOUR FOURTH BEDROOM THEN YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER LITTLE CORRIDOR 
AND IF YOU GO DOWN HERE AND ROUND THE CORNER 
YOU FINALLY COME TO THE FIFTH BEDROOM WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING 
USED AS A TREATMENT ROOM FOR AN ACUPUNCTURE BUSINESS 
IT'S A REALLY GOOD SIZE AND I THINK I WOULD BE 
INCLINED TO USE THIS AS THE MASTER BEDROOM BECAUSE IT'S CERTAINLY THE MOST IMPRESSIVE OF THE FIVE 
THAT'S HUGE 
THAT IS FANTASTIC LOOK YOU'VE GOT WINDOWS IN WINDOWS IN THE ROOF AND IN THE WALLS 
ROOF I WAS THINKING IN WELSH THEN I COULDN'T THINK OF THE WORD AND THE WALLS FANTASTIC 
DOUBLE BED IN THERE AMPLE 
GWYNETH AND RHYS HAVE SEEN ALL OF MY FOUR PROPERTIES SO IT'S DECISION TIME 
WHICH TWO WILL THEY WANT TO VIEW 
FIRST UP YSGOLDRE IN BONT DOLGADFAN 
IS A FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE WITH THREE ACRES OF LAND 
AND OUTBUILDINGS FOR MY FAMILY'S HOLIDAY LET BUSINESS 
WHAT'S MORE IT'S UNDER BUDGET 
BUT IT'S LET DOWN BY THE BIZARRE LAYOUT 
PLUS IT'S SLIGHTLY OUTSIDE THEIR PREFERRED LOCATION 
MY SECOND PROPERTY GLYNDWR HOUSE IN LLANBRYNMAIR 
IS THE CHEAPEST A SUBSTANTIAL ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND UNDER BUDGET 
IT'S BEEN BEAUTIFULLY RENOVATED AND HAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE 
EN SUITE BATHROOMS I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME 
BUT WILL THE LACK OF OUTSIDE SPACE 
FOR HOLIDAY LETS PUT THE LLEWELLYNS OFF 
PRICED AT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND Y. R. ALLT IN MALLWYD 
IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE OF THE FOUR HOUSES 
BUT FOR THAT YOU DO GET THIRTY SIX ACRES HEAPS OF POTENTIAL 
FOR THOSE HOLIDAY LETS AND IT'S IN A PRIME LOCATION FOR GWYNETH AND RHYS 
BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH WORK 
MY COUPLE ARE PREPARED TO DO TO THE DATED INTERIOR 
MY FINAL HOME PLAS RHIWGWREIDDYN IN CEINWS 
IS JUST THAT HOMELY YET FULL OF CHARACTER 
FINISHED TO AN INCREDIBLY HIGH STANDARD 
IT ALSO HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF FIVE BEDROOMS AND IT'S UNDER BUDGET 
MY ONLY CRITICISM IS THE STEEP LAND 
WHICH MAY PROVE TOO DIFFICULT FOR BUILDING LOG CABINS 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE SEEN ALREADY 
YSGOLDRE IN BONT DOLGADFAN I LIKED THE LAND THE AMOUNT OF LAND IT HAD 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS GREAT 
AND BUT I DIDN'T PARTICULARLY LIKE THE PROPERTY TO BE HONEST 
I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE THE LOOK OF IT FROM THE OUTSIDE 
NO NO O. K. 
INITIALLY I LIKED THIS ONE LOOKS LOVELY FROM THE OUTSIDE 
BUT IT'S IN THE VILLAGE THAT'S THE ONLY THING 
WE'RE NOT REALLY LOOKING TO LIVE IN THE VILLAGE REALLY NO LAND EITHER 
NO LAND NO 
THE GARDEN'S SMALL ISN'T IT 
EXACTLY NO NO 
Y. R. ALLT 
I LIKED THE FEEL OF THIS ONE THE LOCATION LOOKED GOOD 
I LIKE THIS ONE I MUST SAY I'D LIKE TO SEE IT 
I THINK THAT'S A DEFINITE YES 
AND PLAS RHIWGWREIDDYN THE LAST ONE 
I LIKE THIS ONE I LIKE THIS ONE 
I THINK THE INSIDE IS FANTASTIC 
IT'S GOT A LOVELY LOOK TO IT INSIDE AND OUT 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS LAND THOUGH IT LOOKS A BIT STEEP AND HEAVILY WOODED 
I FEEL IT'S DEFINITELY US 
YES IT'S A YES SO IT WILL BE PLAS RHIWGWREIDDYN 
AND Y. R. ALLT MALLWYD 
THOSE ARE THE ONES DEFINITELY 
TODAY THEY'RE OFF TO SEE THEIR FIRST PROPERTY IN MALLWYD

LISTEN TO THE RAIN THOUGH 
I JUST DON'T THINK LOG CABINS WOULD WORK UP HERE 
IT'S A BIT TOO STEEP YOU KNOW 
AND THEY'D BE LOOKING DOWN ON US ON OUR HOME YEAH 
WE'D LOSE THAT ASPECT OF PRIVACY 
YEAH NOT FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE HOUSE 
I DON'T THINK IT'S CHILD FRIENDLY EITHER IS IT YOU KNOW 
NO WE'D BE IN CASUALTY MORE OFTEN THAN HOME I THINK 
SO YOU'VE SEEN TWO VERY DIFFERENT OPTIONS 
OPTION NUMBER ONE LOTS OF HARD WORK 
OPTION NUMBER TWO READY MADE HOUSE 
ARE YOU GOING TO BE MAKING AN OFFER ON EITHER OF THEM 
NOT AT THIS STAGE ONE DON'T THINK NO 
NUMBER ONE WE THOUGHT WAS TOO MUCH WORK TO BE HONEST 
NOW I WOULD HAVE PUT GOOD MONEY ON THE FACT THAT YOU'D FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS PROPERTY 
WE DO LIKE THIS PROPERTY THERE'S NO TWO WAYS ABOUT IT 
IT'S LOVELY SO WHY NOT THIS ONE 
THE LOCATION IT DOES RAIN HERE ALL THE TIME TO BE HONEST 
SO OBVIOUSLY NO OFFERS TODAY BUT IS THERE ANYTHING 
THAT YOU'RE TAKING AWAY FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR SEARCH TOGETHER 
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU'VE LEARNED YEAH DEFINITELY 
I THINK WHAT WE ONE BIG THING THAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST 
THE PROPERTY THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IT'S THE PROPERTY AND THE LOCATION 
THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER WOULD MAKE THE PERFECT PLACE FOR US 
AND ALSO THERE AREN'T THAT MANY PROPERTIES AVAILABLE 
DON'T BE DOWNHEARTED AND DO KEEP ON SEARCHING 
I HAVE LEARNED THAT I SHOULD NEVER GET OVER EXCITED ABOUT A PROPERTY 
BEFORE I'VE CHECKED THE LOCAL WEATHER CONDITIONS 
AND I'VE ALSO LEARNED A BIT OF WELSH WHICH I'VE BEEN PRACTISING TO SAY TO YOU 
POB LWC DIOLCH CATHERINE 
IN CASE YOU DIDN'T QUITE GET MY ACCENT I'M JUST TRYING TO SAY BEST OF LUCK 
I REALLY HOPE YOU FIND SOMEWHERE AND THAT YOUR BABY GETS TO GROW UP IN THE COUNTRYSIDE 
RATHER THAN IN CARDIFF SO DO KEEP ME KEEP ME POSTED AS TO WHERE YOU END UP 
AND I'LL PASS BY AND HAVE A BIT OF AN ENGLAND WALES LINE UP 
YEAH WHY NOT WALES WILL WIN 
RHYS AND GWYNETH ARE STILL ON THE HUNT IN GWYNEDD 
IN THE MEANTIME THEY PLAN TO RENT IN CARDIFF 
SO THEY'LL BE IN POLE POSITION TO MOVE WHEN THEY FIND THEIR DREAM HOUSE
