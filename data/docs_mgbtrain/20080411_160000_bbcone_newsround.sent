VIOLIN PLAYERS OUTNUMBER BOYS THREE TO ONE 
EIGHT OUT OF TEN GUITAR PLAYERS ARE

THIS HAPPENS IS THAT PARENTS 
ENCOURAGE BOYS TO PLAY BIG

NOISE 
WHILE MUMS AND DADS THINK NOISE GIRLS SHOULD PLAY SMALLER 
INSTRUMENTS THAT MAKE A HIGHER 
NOISE

THOUGHT SWIMMING IN FREEZING

EQUIPMENT THAT IS WHAT THEY 
PHOTOGRAPHER AND SOME DIVERS HAVE 
BEEN DOING TO GET RARE PICTURES OF 
BELUGA WHALES IT HAPPENED IN THE 
ICY WATERS OF THE WHITE SEA NEAR

DIVE INTO ICY WATERS TO GET UP 
CLOSE AND PERSONAL WITH THEM ALL 
WHITE WITH A MELON SHAPED HEAD 
THEY ONLY LIVE IN VERY COLD WATERS 
AROUND THE ARCTIC THEY MAY BE 
GENTLE BUT THEY ARE REALLY BEGAN 
VERY HEAVY SO THE DIVERS HAD TO BE 
CAREFUL NOT TO BE HIT BY THEM AS 
THE WHALES ARE CURIOUS AND THEY 
LOVE TO PLAY

GRABBED HOLD OF YOUR LEG AND YOU

DOWN BUT THEY ARE JUST PLAYING 
JUST TOUCHING YOU JUST FEELING YOU 
WORRIED THAT AIR TANKS WOULD SCARE 
THE WHALES AWAY THE TEAM DID NOT 
USE SCUBA DIVING EQUIPMENT BUT 
DECIDED TO FREE DIVE SO THEY HAD 
TO HOLD THEIR BREATH WHILE SWIMMING
