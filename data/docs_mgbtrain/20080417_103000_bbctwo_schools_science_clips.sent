WHEE 
AHH 
A A A ARGH 
WHEE 
OH AH HA 
HAVE YOU THOUGHT HOW SIMILAR YOU ARE TO A PLANT OR A FLOWER 
NOW THAT MAY SOUND A FUNNY QUESTION 
BUT PLANTS JUST LIKE PEOPLE ARE LIVING THINGS 
AND IN MANY WAYS ALL LIVING THINGS ARE ALIKE 
WHEN YOU THINK OF PLANTS DOING THINGS THAT LIVING THINGS DO 
IT SEEMS A BIT ODD 
LIKE PLANTS HAVING BABIES OR EATING OR EVEN MOVING 
I MEAN THEY LOOK PRETTY ROOTED TO ME 
WHEN WE SAY PLANTS ARE LIVING THINGS WHAT DO WE MEAN 
TO FIND OUT 
I'M VISITING ONE OF THE GREATEST COLLECTIONS OF PLANTS IN THE WORLD 
IN THE PALM HOUSE AT KEW GARDENS 
THE PALM HOUSE IS LIKE A MASSIVE GREENHOUSE 
IT'S BATHED IN SUNLIGHT AND IT'S JUST FULL OF EXOTIC PLANTS 
ALL GROWING CLOSE TOGETHER 
THE FACT THAT PLANTS GROW IS PRETTY IMPORTANT 
IF SOMETHING GROWS IT SHOWS THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH A LIVING THING 
AND FOR THINGS THAT GROW YOU CAN'T DO BETTER THAN TROPICAL BAMBOOS 
THEY'RE SO TOUGH THAT IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD THEY BUILD WITH THEM 
WHAT'S REALLY AMAZING ABOUT THESE BAMBOOS IS HOW FAST THEY CAN GROW 
SOMETIMES AS MUCH AS A METRE EVERY SINGLE DAY 
THE NEXT THING I WANTED TO FIND OUT WAS HOW A PLANT MOVES 
MOVING LIKE GROWING IS SOMETHING DONE BY LIVING THINGS 
IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG TO FIND THIS PLANT 
WHICH CLOSES ITS LEAVES WHEN YOU TOUCH IT 
IN FACT ALTHOUGH PLANTS ARE ROOTED TO THE GROUND 
THEY'RE MOVING ALL THE TIME IT TAKES A SPECIAL CAMERA TO SEE IT 
MACK THE KNIFE 
O. K. SO THAT'S GROWING AND MOVING NEXT ON MY LIST REPRODUCTION 
THE WAY LIVING THINGS HAVE BABIES OR YOUNG OF SOME KIND 
COME AND TAKE A LOOK AT THIS THIS IS A COCOA PLANT 
CAN YOU SEE THAT ORANGE POD HANGING OFF THE TRUNK 
IT'S PACKED WITH SEEDS 
WHEN IT SPLITS OPEN NEW PLANTS WILL BE CREATED 
YOU CAN SEE ON THE TRUNK 
THESE TINY WHITE BITS ARE NEW SEED PODS SPRINGING INTO LIFE 
ACTUALLY THE MORE COCOA PLANTS IN THE WORLD THE BETTER 
BECAUSE COCOA IS WHAT CHOCOLATE'S MADE FROM 
HOW DO PLANTS EAT 
PLANTS DON'T EAT LIKE WE DO 
FOR THEM TO GROW THEY NEED WATER AIR 
AND SUNLIGHT TO MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD 
FILMED WITH A SPECIAL CAMERA THIS SEED IS JUST STARTING TO GROW 
FIRST THE ROOT PUSHES DOWN INTO THE SOIL 
AND THEN THE SHOOT GROWS UP TOWARDS THE LIGHT 
THIS RUNNER BEAN PLANT HAS A VERY LONG STEM 
IT GROWS LEAVES AND FLOWERS 
THE PETALS THEN WITHER AND BEAN PODS GROW 
THE PODS CONTAIN THE SEEDS 
WHICH MAKE NEW PLANTS UNLESS WE EAT THEM 
PLANTS GIVE US LOTS OF THINGS THE WICKER TO MAKE THESE BASKETS 
AS WELL AS THE WHEAT TO MAKE BREAD 
COOKING OIL IS PRESSED FROM NUTS AND SEEDS 
AND THE WOOD FOR THESE BOXES COMES FROM TREES AS DO THE ORANGES 
RUBBER FOR THESE GLOVES COMES FROM TREES 
DO YOU KNOW EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE WITH A COCONUT 
THE FIBRES ON THE OUTSIDE CAN BE WOVEN INTO THINGS LIKE MATS 
INSIDE THERE IS A SWEET DRINK COCONUT MILK 
WHICH IS FULL OF NUTRIENTS 
AROUND THAT IS A THICK WHITE FLESH WHICH TASTES NICE 
IT CAN BE DRIED AND USED IN CAKES AND THINGS 
BANANA BOAT SONG 
THIS IS JAMAICA A GREAT PLACE TO GROW BANANAS 
NIGHT A COME AND ME WAN GO HOME 
THERE ARE BANANAS HERE OF ALL SIZES 
IT'S NOT LIKE BRITAIN WHERE FRUIT RIPENS ONCE A YEAR 
PEOPLE CAN PICK BANANAS HERE ALL YEAR ROUND 
EVEN IN WINTER 
HOW BIG IS THIS PLANTATION ANNE 
THIS FARM IS VERY BIG OVER HALF THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN WORK HERE 
NOW YOU'RE SWINGING A VERY LARGE KNIFE MY WAY WHY 
THIS IS A MACHETE VERY HANDY ON A BANANA PLANTATION HERE HAVE IT 
WHY DO I NEED THIS YOU'LL SEE 
THE FIRST THING ANNE SHOWED ME WAS A BIG PURPLE FLOWER 
INSIDE THE BANANAS WERE GROWING 
EVERY DAY THE PETAL COMES UP AND YOU CAN SEE THE TINY BANANAS UNDERNEATH 
WHEN THEY GROW TOGETHER LIKE THIS IT'S CALLED A HAND 
I BET THEY ARE CALLED FINGERS YEAH 
YES ALL THE FINGERS TOGETHER MAKE UP A HAND 
AS THEY GROW THEY TURN ALL THE WAY UP AND STRAIGHTEN OUT 
THEY PUT THE PLASTIC BAGS ON 
TO STOP INSECTS AND BIRDS SCRATCHING THE BANANAS 
AND IT MAKES IT NICE AND WARM INSIDE FOR THE BANANAS TO GROW IN O. K. 
INSIDE THEIR PLASTIC COATS 
THE SMALL GREEN BANANAS GROW AND THICKEN 
AND THEN WHEN THEY'RE BIG ENOUGH IT'S THE BIT I LIKE BEST 
TIME FOR THE BANANAS TO BE PICKED 
NIGHT A COME AND ME WAN GO HOME 
LYRICS UNCLEAR 
NIGHT A COME AND ME WAN GO HOME 
NINE HAND TEN HAND ELEVEN HAND BUNCH 
NIGHT A COME AND ME WAN GO HOME 
WHY NOT CUT THAT TREE DOWN WITH THAT MACHETE YOU HAVE 
O. K. WHAT DO I DO 
JUST STAND OVER THERE AND SWING 
STAND BACK ANNE STAND BACK 
AH THERE IT GOES 
IT MIGHT SEEM STRANGE CHOPPING A BANANA TREE DOWN 
BUT UNDER EVERY TREE THERE ARE BABY SHOOTS GROWING 
YOU CUT DOWN THE TREE SO THE NEXT BANANA PLANT GROWS AND BEARS FRUIT 
NIGHT IS A NIGHT O. 
NIGHT A COME 
AND ME WAN GO HOME
