YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO FAR TO FIND INTERESTING PLANTS AND ANIMALS 
THE AVERAGE BACK GARDEN PROVIDES SHELTER AND FOOD FOR MANY 
ANTS WILL FIND A TREAT IF YOU LEAVE SOME JAM OUT 
BEES WILL COLLECT NECTAR FROM FLOWERS 
ROBINS COLLECT GRUBS FROM THE SOIL 
AND CARRY THEM OFF TO FEED THEIR YOUNG 
THERE MIGHT BE FOXES VISITING YOUR GARDEN TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN FIND 
THESE STRAWBERRIES ARE PROVIDING A GOOD MEAL FOR A MOUSE 
OH OH 
SO HOW DO YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE THEN THE TOAD YOU'VE GOT HERE HAS ROUGH SKIN 
IT'S MUCH LESS AGILE THE FROGS DO LEAP A LOT MORE 
AND STRUGGLE A LOT MORE THAN THE TOADS DO 
YOURS IS QUITE MOIST WHEREAS MY TOAD HE'S DRY 
ONE THING THAT I USE TO RECOGNISE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM 
IS ACTUALLY THE EXPRESSIONS ON THEIR FACE 
AND THEY DO HAVE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY 
WHAT'S THE SECRET OF BEETLE HUNTING WELL BASICALLY GRUBBING AROUND 
GETTING DOWN ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES WE'RE TALKING REAL BEETLES 
THESE ARE PROPER BEETLES GOOD GROUND BEETLES 
COME BACK HE'S LOVELY HE HASN'T GOT AN ENGLISH NAME 
I CALL IT THE HEATH GROUND BEETLE IT'S CALLED CARABUS ARVENSIS 
HE LIKES THE DRY HEATH LAND HABITAT HE'S A BEAUTIFUL COLOUR 
THAT IS LITERALLY BRONZE LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND SOME MORE 
OOH OH MY GOODNESS THAT'S ONE CALLED CARABUS NITENS HAS HE NOT GOT A NAME EITHER 
NO A LOT OF THEM HAVEN'T COME ON 
SOME OF THEM ARE CALLED GOLDSMITHS SO YOU COULD CALL IT A HEATH GOLDSMITH 
OH HE'S A LOVELY ONE THIS IS ONE CALLED A KUGELANN'S GROUND BEETLE THIS IS QUITE A RARE ONE 
THIS IS A DAY HUNTING THING IT LIKES TO RUN ABOUT IN THE SUNSHINE 
IT'LL EAT OTHER BEETLES HOW DO THEY FEED 
THEY RUN ALONG CATCH ANYTHING THEY CAN GET HOLD OF LITTLE FLIES 
ANTS FLIES OTHER SMALLER BEETLES 
THEY JUST LOCK ONTO THEM WITH THEIR JAWS AND MUNCH THEM 
OH BEAUTIFUL COLOUR WHAT IS THIS THIS IS THE BLUE GROUND BEETLE 
AND HOW RARE IS THIS GUY THEN IT'S VERY VERY RARE 
IT'S ONLY FOUND IN SEVEN WOODS IN SOUTH WEST ENGLAND ALL IN DEVON AND CORNWALL 
IT'S GOT SOME RATHER LARGE JAWS ON THE FRONT THERE YEAH 
AND IT'LL CLIMB UP A TREE FOLLOWING THE SLUG'S SLIME TRAIL 
AND THEN ONCE IT CATCHES UP WITH THE SLUG 
IT GRABS THE SLUG WITH ITS PINCER JAWS AND BASICALLY HOOKS ONTO IT 
AND THEN IT INJECTS THE CONTENTS OF ITS STOMACH INTO THE SLUG 
YEAH AND DIGESTS IT'S QUITE REVOLTING 
IT DIGESTS THE SLUG OUTSIDE OF THE BODY AND THEN SUCKS UP WHAT'S LEFT SO IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR OR SO 
A BEETLE THIS SIZE WOULD EAT A SLUG BIGGER THAN ITSELF IN ONE SITTING 
NOW I BET YOU WISH YOU COULD SEE THAT DON'T YOU 
THE SEA MOVES IN AND OUT TWICE EACH DAY IT'S KNOWN AS THE TIDE 
AT HIGH TIDE THIS PATCH OF ROCK IS UNDER WATER 
AT LOW TIDE THE SEA'S DRAWN BACK AND THE ROCKS DRY OUT IN THE SUN 
IT'S CHANGING ALL THE TIME WET THEN DRY THEN WET THEN DRY 
IT MAKES LIVING HERE DIFFICULT BUT SOME CREATURES DO MANAGE IT 
LOOK INTO THESE ROCK POOLS AND YOU'LL FIND THEM FILLED WITH ALL SORTS OF LIFE 
WHAT KIND OF CREATURES HAVE YOU FOUND IN THE ROCK POOL 
I'VE FOUND TWO SMALL BEADLET SEA ANEMONES 
IF YOU LOOK AT HIM IN THE WATER YOU SEE THE TENTACLES 
THAT ARE OUT ON THE TOP HE'S FEEDING AT THE MOMENT 
IF WE TAKE HIM OUT WE CAN SEE JUST HOW WELL ATTACHED HE IS TO THE ROCK 
YEAH HE'S COMPLETELY STUCK THERE 
THIS MAKES SURE HE'S NOT WASHED AWAY BY POWERFUL CURRENTS AND WAVES IN THE SEA 
HE'S VERY FIRMLY ATTACHED BUT HE CAN MOVE FROM ROCK TO ROCK 
WHICH ENABLES HIM TO FIND A BETTER FEEDING AREA 
WE'LL PUT THIS BACK IN THE WATER WE'VE GOT SOME SEAWEED DOWN HERE 
LIKE THE SEA ANEMONE THE SEAWEED'S VERY SOUNDLY ATTACHED TO THE ROCKS 
THIS TYPE IS CALLED BLADDERWRACK 
AND IT'S GOT LOTS OF LITTLE AIR POCKETS WHEN THE TIDE COMES BACK IN AND COVERS THE WEED WITH WATER 
IT'LL ACTUALLY FLOAT UP ALLOWING IT TO DRIFT AROUND 
SEAWEED AND ANEMONES HAVE TO BE WELL STUCK ON 
BECAUSE THE SEASHORE'S A REALLY TOUGH WORLD 
ALL THE TIME THE WAVES ARE CRASHING DOWN 
AND NOTHING SURVIVES HERE WITHOUT SOME SORT OF PROTECTION 
OH YES THAT'S A BIG ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE A SHORE CRAB A MALE 
ON THE UNDERSIDE THE SHAPE OF THE TAIL SHOWS IT'S A MALE HE'S MISSING A CLAW 
AND TWO LEGS AT THE BACK THIS IS QUITE COMMON FOR CRABS 
BECAUSE THEY OFTEN FIGHT WITH EACH OTHER 
AND THEN LATER ON THEY CAN ACTUALLY GROW A NEW CLAW OR NEW LEGS 
A CRAB'S SHELL IS LIKE A SUIT OF ARMOUR 
PROTECTING IT AGAINST ALL SORTS OF ENEMIES OTHER CRABS POISONOUS FISH SEA BIRDS 
AND IT'S ALSO A SURPRISINGLY GOOD DISGUISE 
THIS IS A SMALLER ONE A GREEN ONE THEY VARY IN COLOUR CONSIDERABLY 
YOU SEE ALL THE DIFFERENT COLOURS IN THE ROCK POOL EACH CRAB BLENDS IN 
THAT ONE'S GOT A RED UNDERSIDE WHEREAS THIS ONE IS GREEN 
IT'S BLOWING BUBBLES AS IT TRIES TO BREATHE 
I COULDN'T GET OVER HOW MUCH LIFE THERE WAS IN THIS HARSH ROCKY WORLD 
AND MARCUS HAD SAVED THE BEST TILL LAST 
OH LOOK IT'S A STARFISH CAN I TURN IT OVER 
YES IT DOESN'T BITE DOES IT NO THEY'RE HARMLESS LOOK ALL THE LEGS 
LOOK DOWN THE CENTRE OF THE ARMS YOU CAN SEE HIS TUBE FEET 
HE HAS HUNDREDS OF THOSE THEY'VE ALL GOT LITTLE SUCKERS ON THE END 
AND WHEN THEY ALL MOVE IN THE SAME DIRECTION THAT'S HOW HE WALKS ACROSS THE SEA BED AMAZING 
VERY PRETTY I'D BETTER PUT HIM BACK 
MY DREAM COMMISSION WOULD BE THERE ARE SO MANY 
MY DREAM COMMISSION GOLLY 
I WOULD LOVE TO GET A COMMISSION TO WRITE A BIG ORCHESTRAL WORK
