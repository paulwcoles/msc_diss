I'M SORRY I CAN'T BE WITH YOU TODAY BUT AS TYPICAL IN BUSINESS 
I'VE BEEN CALLED AWAY TO ATTEND TO AN URGENT MATTER 
YOU ARE GOING TO PROVE TO ME THAT YOU CAN BRING ME SOME MONEY BACK TO THE BOARDROOM 
FROM VIRTUALLY A ZERO POSITION 
YOU'RE GOING TO START A LAUNDRY BUSINESS FROM SCRATCH 
I'VE LAID ON TWO LAUNDRIES FOR YOU

AND MOST CERTAINLY MAKE SURE THE QUALITY'S RIGHT 
BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING WHEN STUFF COMES BACK FROM THE LAUNDRY THAT I DON'T LIKE 
I SLING IT BACK AT THEM 
THE TEAM THAT COMES BACK WITH THE MOST MONEY WINS 
THE TEAM THAT DOESN'T LOSES AND AS USUAL IN THAT LOSING TEAM

I WILL I WILL TAKE THIS ON IF YOU ARE ALL HAPPY 
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU TO TAKE IT ON AND AND ARE BEHIND ME ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT 
RIGHT ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT ABSOLUTELY 
I WAS VERY HAPPY TO BE PROJECT MANAGER BECAUSE AS I SAW IT 
I HAD BEEN IN THE BOARDROOM 
AND SAW THE NEXT TASK AS A TASK FOR ME TO PROVE MYSELF 
LET'S ABSOLUTELY KICK ARSE 
I WOULDN'T LOOK AT RAEF AS A NATURAL LEADER 
HE'S NOT VERY BRASH HE'S NOT LIKE WHOA OUT THERE THAT TYPE OF THING 
I'VE GOT NO PROBLEM YOU KNOW WITH TAKING THIS AH YOU KNOW STRAIGHT BY THE AH 
HORNS BY THE HORNS YEAH ABSOLUTELY 
RAEF'S DIFFERENT TO A LOT OF US IN A LOT OF HIS MANNERISMS 
HIS UPBRINGING 
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT HE WON'T BE ACCEPTED INTO A GROUP AT ALL 
AT THE SAME TIME IF HE DOESN'T PULL HIS WEIGHT 
THEN THERE'LL BE A DIFFICULTY AND THERE'LL BE A PROBLEM 
LET'S GO FOR IT GUYS 
FOR THE GIRLS AWARD WINNING SALESWOMAN JENNY IS KEEN TO LEAD 
I'D VERY MUCH LIKE TO BE PROJECT MANAGER TODAY IF YOU'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT YEAH I'M HAPPY 
I'M HAPPY YOU'RE HAPPY YEAH I'M HAPPY EXCELLENT 
I WAS REALLY KEEN TO BE PROJECT MANAGER BECAUSE UM 
I COME FROM A VERY TOUGH SALES BACKGROUND 
WHERE I'VE BEEN HUGELY SUCCESSFUL AND I DON'T MIND PUTTING MY NECK ON THE LINE 
WE'VE GOT LOADS AND LOADS OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BRAINSTORM 
WE NEED TO LAY SOME SOLID FOUNDATIONS AND THEN GO OUT AND WORK OUR COTTON SOCKS OFF TODAY 
RAEF'S FIRST JOB DECIDE WHO WILL DO WHAT 
I'VE GOT MY DOOR KNOCKING FIST AT THE READY MATE YEP 
AH SIMON I HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE OF LAUNDRY EQUIPMENT IN BOSNIA 
I'VE I'VE USED THE EQUIPMENT 
I'M NOT I'M NO EXPERT ON IT BUT IRONING 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON AS A SOLDIER 
I HAVE IRONED MORE SHIRTS SO CAN WE DO THIS THING 
AND THIS IS HOT SWEATY GRAFTY WORK 
I WAS AN N. C. O. IN THE ARMY FOR THE BEST PART OF THE NINETEEN NINETIES 
I'VE DONE PEACEKEEPING IN BOSNIA AND CYPRUS 
I THINK THERE'S A BIG POTENTIAL TO MESS THIS UP YEAH THERE IS 
LOSE ONE SOCK FOR A RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER YOU'VE LOST YOUR BUSINESS AND YOU'RE SCREWED YEAH TRUE 
WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL SO SIMON I GUESS WE'LL CALL YOU KIND OF THE ADMIN MAN 
ADMIN AND LOGISTICS AND MAKE SURE THAT THE COGS ARE OILED 
ALTHOUGH YOU ARE GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON THE BUSINESS CUSTOMERS 
UPSTAIRS PROJECT MANAGER JENNY SPENDS THE FIRST HOUR ON A SALES LECTURE 
DO FIND OUT BUSINESS RATES AND ALSO CONSUMER RATES 
UNLESS WE USE THEIR 
STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP 
I THEN WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT HOW THEY'RE PRICING UP THE WASHING 
ARE THEY DOING IT BY BUCKET LOAD ARE THEY DOING IT BY BASKET LOAD 
ARE THEY DOING IT BY THE NUMBER OF ITEMS 
O. K. WE NEED TO PLAN BUT WE DON'T GO ON PLANNING 
AND PLANNING AND PLANNING AND MORE PLANNING 
WHAT SPECIAL OFFERS HAVE YOU GOT ON WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME OH I'M SORRY THAT'S TOO EXPENSIVE 
SHE JUST GOES ON AND ON AND FAFFS ON 
WE NEED ALL THE IDEAS TO BE ROLLING OFF EACH OTHER SO SHALL WE START OFF WITH THE CUSTOMERS 
I THINK JENNY'S VERY DEFINITELY IN CHARGE OF THE WHOLE GROUP 
BUT SHE HAS HER FAVOURITES 
I KNOW THAT YOU H. YOU'VE MULTI SKILLED AND TALENTED YOU'RE HUGELY CREATIVE AREN'T YOU 
CHAS I THINK YEAH BRILLIANT BUT I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT YOU AT THE MOMENT LISA 
AND WHERE YOUR STRONG YOUR STRENGTHS LIE I'VE NEVER DONE ANY MARKETING OR ANY DESIGN 
THERE'S ALREADY CLIQUES GOING ON UM 
PEOPLE ARE VYING FOR THE PRIME SPOT 
A SITUATION WHICH I DO FIND A LITTLE BIT IRKSOME 
IF WE'RE DOING FORTY ITEMS FOR TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE IT COSTS US TWO TO DO A WASH 
IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO HELENE REGARDING YOUR IDEAS WOULD THAT BE O. K. 
I AM NOT INVOLVED IN ANY OTHER GROUPS BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ALLEGIANCE TO ANYONE 
THE BOYS ARE ABOUT TO LEAVE THE HOUSE WHEN A FINAL THOUGHT OCCURS TO THEM 
WE'VE GOT AN INDUSTRIAL STEAM IRON DOWNSTAIRS WE'VE GOT IRONS 
BUT THESE ARE SHARED THE GIRLS ARE GOING TO THINK THE SAME THING THEY'RE NOT STUPID 
WE DON'T HAVE TO SHARE ANYTHING WE'LL JUST BRING IT UP HERE NOW AND JUST RESERVE IT FOR US 
WHAT'S THIS BUSINESS ABOUT SHARING 
IF THEY HAVEN'T TAKEN THE INITIATIVE WE BLOODY WELL WILL GO AND GET IT 
GO GRAB IT PUT IT IN OUR OFFICE BRING BOTH OF THE IRONS 
THEY GRAB ALL THE IRONING EQUIPMENT IN THE HOUSE 
WHATEVER'S GONNA HAPPEN LADS WE'RE GOING TO SMASH THE GIRLS THAT IS A GIVEN 
THAT'S FOR SURE THAT HAS TO HAPPEN 
NOTHING'S WORRYING ME AT ALL I'M COMPLETELY CONFIDENT 
THAT WE'RE GOING TO EXECUTE THIS TASK WITH THE AH THE SUCCESS AND VIGOUR THAT WE NEED TO 
FUCK 
LET'S DO THIS IN IT TO WIN IT 
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION ABOUT LOSING THIS O. K. 
THE GIRLS FOLLOW BUT CAN'T AGREE HOW TO DIVIDE UP 
I WAS WORKING ON THE STRATEGY TO DO THE COMMERCIAL 
O. K. THAT'S FINE THAT'S FINE

I THINK WE COULD ALMOST GET AWAY WITH MOST OF THEM WITHOUT HAVING TO IRON IF WE SHAKE AND FOLD 
RIGHT LUCINDA YOU'RE STANDING THERE HOLDING THEM UP 
WE'VE GOT TWO MINUTES TO GET ALL OF THESE INTO THE VAN 
I DON'T WANT YOU PAYING THAT MUCH ATTENTION TO DETAIL WHEN WE'VE GOT THREE MINUTES TO GET IT OUT 
I HAVE TO SAY LUCINDA I'M ABSOLUTELY THOROUGHLY DISAPPOINTED WITH YOUR BEHAVIOUR TONIGHT 
I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT POINT WITH YOU YOU WERE GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES 
THIS EVENING I HAVE WATCHED YOU 
WE'VE GOT TWO MINUTES TO GET THE BLOODY NAPKINS OUT TO THE VAN 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE UNLOADING THEM FROM THE TUMBLE DRYER 
AND YOU'RE TAKING ONE OUT AND FOLDING IT UP ON THE SIDE 
YOU'RE TAKING ONE NOW WHEN I HAVE TEAM MEMBERS 
DOING SUCH LUDICROUS STUPID THINGS 
IT MEANS I'M HAVING TO CONCENTRATE AND DIRECT A DISPROPORTIONAL AMOUNT OF MY TIME 
ON MANAGING YOU AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT DOING ABSOLUTELY STUPID THINGS YOU SAT THERE NUMBER TWO 
PLEASE LET ME NUMBER TWO PLEASE I HAVEN'T FINISHED 
PLEASE LET ME I'M YOUR PROJECT MANAGER AND I HAVEN'T FINISHED 
PLEASE LET ME RETALIATE ON THE POINTS I HAVE NOT FINISHED 
GIVE ME RESPECT BY LISTENING YOU CAN FEED BACK TO ME NO WHEN I'VE FINISHED 
I WILL COME BACK ON INDIVIDUAL POINTS YOU CAN FEED BACK TO ME IN A MINUTE WHEN I'M FINISHED 
O. K. UNDERSTAND NOT O. K. 
SO WHEN WE HAD WHAT WAS PROBABLY ONE HUNDRED NAPKINS IN THAT TUMBLE DRYER 
YOU DIDN'T TAKE ONE NAPKIN OUT PUT IT ON THE SIDE AND FOLD IT UP THAT'S NOT A FACT 
PLEASE CAN YOU NOT SHOUT AT ME THAT'S NOT FACT 
WHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU HAVE A NICE SLEEP AND WE CAN DISCUSS IT IN THE MORNING 
NO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING IT IT'S NOT 
LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE NOT CAPABLE OF ACKNOWLEDGING WHERE YOU HAVE GONE WRONG 
THAT DOESN'T HELP THE TEAM DYNAMICS AT ALL 
THAT IS LIKE A FUNGUS THAT STARTS EATING AWAY AT THE POSITIVITY OF THE TEAM 
THE REASON WHY I STARTED TO FOLD NAPKINS STUPID 
YOU JUST GO ON AND ON ABOUT ONE THING 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON YOU TAKE ONE SIDE OF THE STORY AND THEN YOU JUST ATTACK 
OH MY GOD I THINK LUCINDA'S CRYING YEAH 
OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE 
WITHOUT THE IRONS AND THE BOYS NOT BACK WORK CAN'T CONTINUE 
CAN WE HAVE A SHOW OF HANDS WHO WANTS TO GO TO BED NOW AND GET UP EARLY

SHE SAID THAT I HADN'T PULLED MY WEIGHT TODAY 
THAT I'VE DESTROYED THE TASK 
UM 
SEVEN AM 
THE GIRLS CALL A MEETING BUT LUCINDA DOESN'T SHOW 
LUCINDA STAYED IN BED THIS MORNING BECAUSE YOU KNOW SHE BASICALLY HAD THE HUFF 
SHE'S AGREED THAT SHE WOULD BE AT THE MEETING AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THE MEETING HAD TO GO AHEAD WITHOUT HER 
LUCINDA ARRIVES AS THE MEETING ENDS 
RIGHT LUCINDA WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO IF POSSIBLE 
IS FOCUS ON GENERATING ON SOME INVOICES 
UH HUH WE'VE GOT ALL THE INFORMATION HERE FOR YOU NO YOU HAVEN'T 
WE HAVE I HAVEN'T SHOWN YOU THE REST OF THE INFORMATION 
LET'S NOT BE ARGUMENTATIVE YOU DIDN'T ATTEND THE MEETING AFTER PEOPLE TRYING TO WAKE YOU UP 
AND THAT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ATTEND A MEETING 
THAT I INVITE YOU TO ATTEND IN THE MORNING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS ALL SORTED OUT 
I'M VERY SORRY I DIDN'T PARTICIPATE LET'S GO AND SORT THIS OUT

MORE TEA SIR ER YES PLEASE 
WHAT HO BLOKE TOP TEA 
TRULY HILARIOUS YOU LOVE IT RAEF 
RAEF WAS A BIT OF AN ENIGMA WHEN I FIRST MET HIM 
I COULDN'T REALLY WORK THE GUY OUT 
EVEN SOME OF THE OFFICERS I WORKED WITH IN THE ARMY ARE NOT AS YOU KNOW AS DISTINGUISHED AS RAEF 
RIGHT GUYS AGAIN ABSOLUTELY CONGRATULATIONS 
UM JOB WELL DONE 
LAST NIGHT IN THE LAUNDRY IT WAS LIKE A MILITARY OPERATION 
I WAS LIKE HIS SERGEANT MAJOR AND HE WAS THE OFFICER IT WAS LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS 
ONWARDS AND UPWARDS FOR THE NEXT TASK 
PERSONALLY I THINK JENNY WAS A REALLY GOOD TEAM MANAGER AND I TELL YOU WHY 
EVERY TIME I DID SOMETHING GOOD I FELT PRAISED 
IT'S DEFINITELY QUITE A DAUNTING EXPERIENCE GOING INTO THE BOARDROOM 
AND IT'S AWFUL TO BE IN THIS SITUATION 
I'M FEELING APPREHENSIVE AND NERVOUS ACTUALLY 
BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE I SHOULD BE IN THERE 
AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR MYSELF AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT TO BE SIR ALAN'S APPRENTICE 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING INTO THE BOARDROOM BECAUSE I FEEL THAT 
SIR ALAN NEEDS TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WOMEN'S TEAM AT THE MOMENT 
I'M THE STRONGEST CANDIDATE WITHIN THE TEAM THAT I'M WORKING IN 
AND I'LL BE REALLY REALLY DELIGHTED TO GET RID OF SOME OF THE WEAKER CANDIDATES 
SEND THE CANDIDATES IN PLEASE THANKS 
SIR ALAN WILL SEE YOU NOW 
JENNY THIS BOILS DOWN TO A HANDFUL OF MAJOR FLAWS HERE 
YOU WENT INTO THIS FIRST PITCH TOTALLY UNPREPARED 
YOU OFFERED THE MAN TO DO HIS LAUNDRY FOR FIVE THOUSAND M. M. M. 
DIDN'T IT SOUND STUPID THE MINUTE FIVE THOUSAND CAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH 
EVERYBODY WAS IN AGREEMENT I'M NOT AN EXPERT AT PRICING 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A BLOODY EXPERT TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T CHARGE FIVE TO LAUNDER A PILLOWCASE 
NOW THAT'S NO BLIMMING EXPERT 
YOU CAN BUY A PILLOW CASE FOR YOU CAN BUY FIVE JUST COMMON SENSE 
JUST ABSOLUTE COMMON SENSE 
YOU WENT INTO THE FISH SHOP AND TOOK AWAY A HUGE BUNDLE OF THINGS FOR NINETEEN OR FIFTEEN 
FIFTEEN FOR TWO BIG BLACK BAGS 
BECAUSE THAT FRANKLY THAT PRICE WAS AS RIDICULOUS AS THE FIVE THOUSAND YOU QUOTED THE HOTEL 
BUT THEN WHEN WE WENT IN WE GOT TEN EXTRA EVEN THOUGH WE HAD 
YEAH ASKING FOR TIPS ASKING FOR 
I DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY WHAT ASKING FOR TIPS 
WHO WAS ASKING FOR TIPS IT WAS MY IDEA 
I SAID THAT WE SHOULD EVERY LOAD THAT WE TAKE BACK THAT WE SHOULD TRY AND GET SOME EXTRA FINANCE 
I DIDN'T SEND YOU OUT TO GET TIPS YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT WAITERS 
I SENT YOU OUT TO DO LAUNDRY NOT BLAGGING PEOPLE 
I DON'T RUN MY BUSINESS BLAGGING PEOPLE FOR TIPS 
I DON'T GET A LITTLE TIP EXTRA TIP AFTER I'VE DELIVERED A LOAD OF TELEVISIONS TO ONE OF MY CUSTOMERS 
I DON'T ASK HIM FOR A TIP 
I THINK THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS 
YOU CONDONED ALL THIS TIP STUFF DID YOU 
WE WERE LOOKING TO MAXIMISE PROFIT AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A LEGITIMATE THING TO DO 
WE WERE COMPETING AGAINST THE BOYS SO WE HAD TO THINK OF AN ANGLE 
WHAT OTHER ANGLES DID YOU HAVE WE ALSO HAD OUR TWENTY FOUR HOUR HOTLINE WE DECIDED THAT MYSELF AND 
WHAT WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR HOTLINE 
MYSELF AND JENNIFER WOULD HAVE BEEN UM WHOEVER DECIDED TO DO THEIR LAUNDRY WITH US 
UM BE THEIR PERSONAL ACCOUNT MANAGER SO IF THEY HAD QUERIES PERSONAL ACCOUNT MANAGER 
LIKE SOMEONE WOULD PHONE UP AND SAY HELLO GIRLS HOW'S MY PANTS DOING 
WE JUST THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE AN ADVANTAGE THAT THE BOYS WOULDN'T HAVE UM WE ALSO 
I DON'T KNOW OF ANYBODY PROGRESSING THEIR LAUNDRY YOU KNOW 
IT'S THE LAST THING I WOULD THINK THEY WOULD WANT TO DO 
YOU KNOW YOU'VE TAKEN IT AWAY ER AND 
I'M GOING TO PHONE THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR HOTLINE TO SEE THE PROGRESS ON MY CALVIN KLEINS 
UM 
WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE IN THIS TASK FOR LOSING PEOPLE'S STUFF 
HOW'D YOU LOSE IT WHAT I BELIEVE HAPPENED IS WE HAD FOUR GIRLS 
WHO WERE SENT BACK TOWARDS THE END OF THE EVENING 
SO THE KEY PEOPLE WHO KNEW WHAT THINGS WERE KEPT SEPARATE WERE IN FACT SENT BACK IN THE VAN 
THE REASON WE SCREWED UP ALL THE RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS THIS AFTERNOON 
AND I HAD THE EMBARRASSMENT ALONG WITH EVERYBODY ELSE 
WAS PURELY BECAUSE THE LAST LOADS THAT CAME OUT OF THAT MACHINE 
HAD NO LABELS NO NOTHING AS SOON AS 
WELL WHO'S FAULT WAS THAT THEN THAT WAS SHAZIA NO 
WE HAD WASHING THAT YOU KNEW WHAT IT WAS AND WHERE IT WENT AND YOU LEFT AND NOBODY ELSE KNEW 
I FELT THAT IF WE HAD TO FINISH BY TWO O'CLOCK THEN WE WOULD USE THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO GO AND GET THE IRONS SO WE COULD WORK THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT TO ENSURE THAT THE JOB GOT DONE ON TIME 
FOR ME IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TRYING TO SECURE AN IRON 
I UNDERSTOOD THAT ON GOING HOME YOU MAYBE WERE THE MAJOR CAUSE FOR THE STUFF THAT WENT MISSING 
SIR ALAN BECAUSE NO ONE COULD IDENTIFY THE STUFF THAT WAS LEFT IN THE LAUNDRY AFTERWARDS 
JENNY THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME DIFFERENCES OF OPINION BETWEEN LUCINDA AND YOURSELF 
I THINK IN A NUTSHELL WHAT IT IS IS YOU'RE SAYING THAT SHE JUST DIDN'T STEP UP TO DO THE WORK 
NOT ONLY NOT STEPPED UP TO DO THE WORK SIR ALAN 
BUT ACTUALLY CAUSED MORE PROBLEMS 
CAN I HEAR WHAT SHE ACTUALLY DID WRONG 
YES CERTAINLY THIS MORNING WE WERE UP AT SEVEN O'CLOCK 
TO MAKE SURE WE COULD DELIVER TO THE CUSTOMERS THAT WE'D GOT 
I HAD ALL MY TEAM TURN UP AT SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING 
THE ONLY PERSON THAT DIDN'T AND TOOK A LIE IN WAS LUCINDA 
SHE'D BEEN ASKED BY THREE DIFFERENT PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY ATTEND THAT MEETING 
WHICH I DON'T THINK WAS DEMONSTRATING A COMMITMENT TO THE TEAM ETHIC 
IN REGARDS TO THE MEETING THIS MORNING I DIDN'T HEAR BEING WOKEN UP 
YOU'RE SAYING YOU DIDN'T DELIBERATELY ABSTAIN ABSOLUTELY NOT 
I JUST FEEL IT'S A WEE BIT OF SCAPEGOATING 
WHEN IN FACT TO ME THE MAIN ISSUE AND THE MAIN PROBLEM WAS THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT 
HELENE I WANT YOUR CALL ON THIS SITUATION 
WHO IS MOST RESPONSIBLE DO YOU THINK FOR THE FAILURE OF THIS TASK 
I DO FEEL IT'S MORE THAN ONE PERSON AND O. K. THEN 
AND I THINK THE BIGGEST REASON IS BECAUSE WE I MEAN LOOK AT US NOW 
IT'S SO CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT WE AREN'T A TEAM 
MAYBE IT COMES DOWN TO THE ACCOUNTABILITY 
OF THE PROJECT MANAGER ENSURING THAT 
WE ALL HAVE TO HAVE A BIT OF ACCOUNTABILITY ABSOLUTELY I TOTALLY AGREE 
AND YOU SAID TO ME 
YOU SAID TWO WASHINGS GOT MIXED 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LAUNDRY UP UNTIL A POINT NO NOT UNTIL THAT SIR ALAN 
GOD I TELL YOU WHAT I AM SICK AND TIRED OF LISTENING TO THIS TALK 
IT IS QUITE CLEAR TO ME THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF ARGUING GOING ON 
THERE STILL IS ARGUING GOING ON HERE NOW AND ARGUING CAN'T BE CONSTRUCTIVE 
HOWEVER MUCH TIME YOU SPENT ARGUING YOU COULD HAVE SPENT GOING OUT AND GETTING SOME MORE LAUNDRY TO DO 
OR ACTUALLY EXECUTING AND DOING THE LAUNDRY 
JENNY TELL ME WHICH TWO PEOPLE YOU ARE GOING TO BRING BACK IN THIS BOARDROOM 
LUCINDA AND SHAZIA RIGHT O. K. 
THE REST OF YOU BLOODY SHAMBLES 
GO BACK TO THE HOUSE 
AND YOU THREE ALSO GO OUTSIDE AND I'LL CALL YOU BACK IN A BIT LATER 
OH 
JENNY'S MAIN PROBLEM THIS ONE SHE WAS SO FIXATED WITH BEING PROJECT MANAGER SHE COULDN'T LOOK SIDEWAYS 
LUCINDA HAD HER GOOD POINTS AND HER BAD POINTS 
I WONDER IF IT'S A CLASH OF TWO PERSONALITIES HERE 
ONE IS JUST NEVER GOING TO GIVE IN TO THE OTHER 
I MEAN IT SEEMS IT'S PERSONAL OR WHAT 
ALL RIGHT WELL LOOK I THINK WE'LL BRING THEM IN NOW AND SORT IT OUT ONCE AND FOR ALL 
SIR ALAN WILL SEE YOU NOW 
LUCINDA YOU'VE HEARD LOTS OF ALLEGATIONS ER ABOUT YOURSELF 
WHY SHOULDN'T I FIRE YOU 
SIR ALAN ONE OF MY STRENGTHS IS IN FACT ENTHUSING OTHERS 
AND ENSURING THAT PEOPLE WORK CONSTRUCTIVELY WITHIN A TEAM 
TEAM MOTIVATION AND WORKING WITHIN A GROUP IS ONE OF MY FORTES 
TEAM MOTIVATION AND WORKING WITHIN A GROUP IS ONE OF YOUR FORTES 
AND YET THE TEAM LEADER SAYS THAT YOU WERE TO SAY THE LEAST 
DISRUPTIVE AND UNCOOPERATIVE 
AT NO TIME HAVE I ACTED OR WILFULLY ACTED TO BE DETRIMENTAL TO THIS TASK 
I WONDER I MEAN RISK MANAGEMENT ASSESSOR IS YOUR SPECIALITY I UNDERSTAND 
IS THAT RIGHT IT IS ONE OF THE AREAS WHICH I'VE WORKED WITHIN YES 
THERE'S A LOT OF RISK AT THE MOMENT I CAN ASSURE YOU BECAUSE THIS 
YOU KNOW THIS MAY BE THE LAST TIME THAT YOU AND I SEE EACH OTHER 
SHAZIA AND THE SAME QUESTION TO YOU WHY SHOULDN'T I FIRE YOU 
I'M AN OPPORTUNIST I'M A DOER 
I DON'T YOU KNOW I DO EVERYTHING THAT IS REQUIRED AND MORE 
IN THIS TASK I DON'T KNOW WHERE I WENT WRONG 
WHERE DID SHE GO WRONG IN THIS TASK JENNY 
UM SHE LIED SHE COMPLAINED LIED 
SHE UM MANIPULATED WITH OTHER PEOPLE 
SHE DIDN'T DELIVER ON THE TASK THAT I'D ALLOCATED HER 
FOR EXAMPLE SHE GAVE THAT I FIND YOU HAVE SELECTIVE AMNESIA COULD YOU BE QUIET 
BECAUSE AN UNDERSTANDING OF SHAZIA HERE 
YOU'RE SAYING TO PEOPLE I ALLOCATED THIS TASK I ALLOCATED THAT 
AND IN FACT YOU HAVEN'T OR YOU DIDN'T JUST BE QUIET YOU WERE IN BED ASLEEP 
CAN I TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING I CAN'T LISTEN TO THREE PEOPLE AT ONCE 
YOU WERE STILL IN BED FOR THE ENTIRE PROCESS THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH BOTH OF YOU 
IT HAS FELT LIKE I HAVE HAD TO BREASTFEED YOU 
THE ITINERARY HAS BEEN TOO LATE 
FOR ME THE TASK WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AND I WANTED TO WIN IT 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW I AM IN THE SITUATION TODAY 
BECAUSE WHAT I HAVE DONE IS I DELIVERED AT EVERY SINGLE OPPORTUNITY 
YOU WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING WHOSE LAUNDRY IS WHAT 
I PUT A PROCESS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY KNEW WHAT THE MACHINES WERE CAPABLE OF 
AT NO POINT WAS ANY MACHINE LEFT UNATTENDED AS SOON AS ONE BUT YOU UNATTENDED THEM 
YOU WENT AWAY AND LEFT THEM 
BUT THAT WAS ON AGREEMENT WITH JENNY 
JENNY DIDN'T COME TO THE LAUNDRETTE UNTIL ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY 
WELL SHE WAS OUT SELLING STILL 
YEAH BUT SHE WAS STILL OUT SELLING AND WE ALREADY HAD A HUGE PILE OF WASHING TO DO 
WHAT TIME DID YOU FINALLY ALL LEAVE THE LAUNDRY TWO O'CLOCK 
O. K. SO SHE PICKED A DEADLINE I'M STILL GOING TO BRING STUFF IN 
AND I DON'T CARE IF YOU'VE GOT A LOT THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT 
AM I MISSING THE WHOLE THE WHOLE PLOT HERE 
DO WE HAVE A KIND OF A PERSONALITY CLASH HERE 
HAS IT GOT NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH BUSINESS 
SIR ALAN THIS IS BUSINESS IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH PERSONALITY 
IT'S DUE TO WHO DELIVERS WHAT AND HOW THEY DELIVER IT I HAVE HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY 
SIR ALAN CAN I JUST SAY THAT WE LOST THREE HOURS 
EXCUSE ME I AM STILL SPEAKING SORRY 
THE TASK WAS FOR US TO DELIVER AS MUCH PROFITABLE BUSINESS 
WE GOT FOUR CLIENTS CAN YOU BE QUIET PLEASE AND GOT ALL OF OUR LAUNDRY BACK TO THEM 
CAN YOU BE QUIET PLEASE IN AN ORGANISED MANNER 
SO WHO WOULD YOU FIRE HERE THEN 
ME WITHOUT A DOUBT JENNY 
AND YOU JENNY 
YOU CAN'T BE VERY PROUD OF THIS SURELY 
SIR ALAN I'M NOT PROUD OF IT AT ALL AND I'M HERE TO DELIVER TO YOU I WANT TO BE YOUR NEXT 
YOU HAVEN'T I KNOW ON THIS TASK I HAVEN'T 
THESE TWO PEOPLE HAVE NOT SUPPORTED ME ONE IOTA 
ALSO THEY DO NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DELIVER TO THE TEAM EITHER 
AND NOT ONLY IS IT THEIR ATTITUDE THAT IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME 
BUT IT IS THEIR LACK OF ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING OF ANY VALUE 
O. K. LISTEN I I THINK I'VE HEARD ENOUGH HERE QUITE FRANKLY 
I MEAN IT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE PEOPLE HERE 
IN VIOLENT DISAGREEMENTS WITH EACH OTHER 
WHICH IS NOT GOOD AT ALL AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IN BUSINESS 
IT'S A DIFFICULT DECISION BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE VERY VERY GOOD REASONS 
FOR ALL OF YOU SITTING IN FRONT OF ME HERE AS TO WHY I SHOULD FIRE YOU 
LUCINDA YOU'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF NOT COOPERATING 
YOU'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF SAYING YOU DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THINGS 
JENNY IT'S REGRETFUL THAT YOU ARE UNABLE TO CONTROL THESE TWO PEOPLE HERE 
I HAVE TO HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE 
I HAVE TO HOLD YOU FULLY RESPONSIBLE 
FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO KEEP A TEAM IN PLACE 
SHAZIA I THINK THE MOST HEINOUS OF THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE DONE HERE 
IS THAT YOU LEFT THAT LAUNDRY 
YOU LEFT YOUR COLLEAGUES THE DIFFICULTY IN IDENTIFYING THE PRODUCT 
SHAZIA PLEASE 
YOU'RE FIRED 
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE ARGUING WITH YOU TWO 
BECAUSE IF YOU WANT ME TO ACCEPT THAT YOU ARE PROFESSIONALS 
THIS HAS BEEN OUTRAGEOUS WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON EVEN IN THIS ROOM 
QUITE FRANKLY IT'S THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD FOR ME TO GET RID OF THE WHOLE BLOODY THREE OF YOU 
O. K. 
I'M GIVING YOU ANOTHER CHANCE 
WITHOUT A DOUBT I BELIEVE THAT THE PERSON WHO IS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR MY DEPARTURE TODAY IS THE PROJECT MANAGER 
I THINK SHE STITCHED ME UP BASICALLY 
SHE NEEDED SOMEONE ELSE TO BRING INTO THE BOARDROOM AND IN THE LAST SECOND JUST TURNED ON ME 
JENNY 
THANK YOU I LOVED IT IT WAS BRILLIANT 
ONE JOB 
NOW FOURTEEN CANDIDATES 
SIR ALAN'S SEARCH FOR HIS APPRENTICE CONTINUES 
NEXT WEEK

BUT IN THE KITCHEN IT'S TEAM SPIRIT THAT'S ON THE BACK BURNER 
IF WE DON'T HAVE THE FOOD READY IT'S YOUR FAULT FINE 
SARA TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FOOD NO SARA DIDN'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY SHE DID 
THIS WAS A TOTAL DISASTER
