I'M THE LAST THEY'RE ALL DEAD NOW 
MY SISTER IRENE DIED ON THE TWENTY FOURTH JANUARY THIS YEAR 
I BETTER NOT TALK ABOUT HER BECAUSE IT MAKES ME CRY 
COS WE USED TO PHONE ONE ANOTHER EVERY DAY 
YOU'RE THE LAST OF THE LINE THERE'S NO ONE LEFT THAT REMEMBERS ANYTHING THAT YOU REMEMBER 
AND YOU DO FEEL VERY ISOLATED 
IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY ON THE SIXTEENTH MARCH 
AND I HAD FOURTEEN CARDS 
AND I USED TO HAVE ABOUT THIRTY 
YOU'LL FIND TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO GREW UP DURING THE WAR 
WE ALL HAVE THE SAME FEELINGS WE DID LEARN TO PUT UP WITH THINGS WHETHER WE WANTED TO OR NOT 
YOU GOT TO GET USED TO EVERYTHING DON'T YOU 
I NEVER EXPECTED TO BE HERE AT THIS AGE 
AND NOBODY LIKES YOU IF YOU MOAN 
SUNDAY IS THE ONLY DAY I GET TO HAVE OFF AND BE WITH MY FAMILY 
SO WHENEVER POSSIBLE I LIKE TO SPEND IT JUST LYING AROUND AT HOME 
BUT WHEN CONTACT THE ELDERLY ASKED IF I COULD HELP OUT I COULDN'T SAY NO 
SO TODAY WE VOLUNTEERED TO BE DRIVERS 
WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO PICK UP EIGHTY NINE YEAR OLD CONSTANCE 
AND TAKE HER FOR TEA 
CONSTANCE IS ONE OF ALMOST THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE 
WHO BENEFIT FROM CONTACT THE ELDERLY'S WORK 
IT ORGANISES TEA PARTIES 
FOR FRAIL AND ISOLATED ELDERLY PEOPLE 
SOUNDS SIMPLE ENOUGH BUT WHEN YOU'RE HOME ALONE DAY AFTER DAY 
A TRIP OUT CAN BE A REAL LIFE SAVER 
I DON'T GO OUT SO MUCH NOW LIKE I USED TO 
I USED TO GO OUT TO BARTON HILL AND THAT'S FOUR BUSES 
I CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM COMING PROPERLY 
YOU KNOW I CAN'T SEE THE NUMBERS NOW 
ONE SUNDAY EACH MONTH VOLUNTEERS PICK UP ELDERLY GUESTS 
AND TAKE THEM TO THE HOME OF A HOST 
WHERE ALL ENJOY A FEW HOURS' COMPANY OVER A CUP OF TEA 
I NEVER BELIEVE ANYTHING UNTIL IT HAPPENS 
AND I'LL BELIEVE JONATHAN WHEN HE TURNS UP 
WHO IS IT HELLO CONSTANCE IT'S JONATHAN 
JONATHAN ROSS OH 
THAT'S WHAT I NORMALLY DO YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT TO HELLO CONSTANCE PLEASED TO MEET YOU 
I'VE GOT MY DAUGHTER WITH ME I'LL INTRODUCE YOU 
SHE'S COME TO HELP OUT 
BETTY THIS IS CONSTANCE HI CONSTANCE 
AND THAT'S BETTY IN THE BACK THERE HELLO BETTY HI CONSTANCE 
LOOK AT DAD DRIVING SO CAREFULLY FOR ONCE BETTY 
YOU'RE NOT A BIT LIKE I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HOW DID YOU THINK I'D BE 
WELL 
NO GO ON DON'T SPARE ME YOU CAN TELL ME THE TRUTH 
I CAN'T I WAS TOLD I WAS NOT TO SAY 
GO ON TELL ME LET'S HEAR IT 
LAVATORY HUMOUR

BUT NOT WHILE WE'RE EATING I PROMISE 
HELLO 
GOOD AFTERNOON 
HELLO EVERYONE I'M JONATHAN AND YOU KNOW CONSTANCE 
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING CONSTANCE 
IT'S A FRIENDLY GATHERING IN A FAMILY SETTING 
WHAT THE GUESTS WOULD HAVE HAD IF THEY HAD RELATIVES NEARBY 
OVER TIME IT BECOMES JUST LIKE MEETING UP WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS' 
DARE I ASK WHO IS THE OLDEST AT THE TABLE 
I THINK IT'S ME I THINK SO 
HOW OLD ARE YOU NINETY LAST SEPTEMBER WOW CONGRATULATIONS 
I'M ONLY NINETY NEXT SEPTEMBER 
JUST A BABY THEN REALLY 
THE SERVICE CONTACT THE ELDERLY PROVIDES 
IS MORE CRUCIAL NOW THAN EVER BEFORE 
ONE HOUSE IN SEVEN IS HOME TO A PENSIONER LIVING ALONE 
AND AS WE LIVE LONGER AND PATTERNS OF FAMILY LIFE CHANGE 
THAT'S ON THE INCREASE 
FOR MANY IT CAN BE A HARD AND LONELY ROAD 
THE THING IS I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALISE 
HOW LONELY AND ISOLATED MANY OAPS FEEL 
OFTEN THEY'RE TOO FRAIL OR LACK THE CONFIDENCE TO LEAVE HOME 
SO WE JUST DON'T SEE THEM BUT GATHERINGS LIKE THIS ARE GREAT FUN 
AND YOU CAN SEE HOW BY GIVING A BIT OF CASH YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
IN MANY PEOPLE'S LIVES 
O. K. EVERYONE 
WE HAD A COUPLE OF BIRTHDAYS LAST WEEK 
WE HAD CONSTANCE AND JOHN 
SO WE'D JUST LIKE TO SAY A VERY VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU 
CURRENTLY CONTACT THE ELDERLY RUN THREE HUNDRED FORTY GROUPS 
WITH YOUR HELP THEY HOPE TO CATER FOR AN EXTRA EIGHT HUNDRED LONELY PEOPLE 
IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS' 
I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE GUESTS THAT WE HAVE 
THAT THEY MIGHT NOT GO TO SEE ANYBODY DURING THE WEEK OR MONTH 
THIS MIGHT BE THEIR ONLY OUTING 
AND WE TRY AND MAKE IT AS SPECIAL AS POSSIBLE 
AND IT'S ENJOYABLE ON BOTH SIDES 
FOR THE GUESTS AND THE HOSTS AND FOR THE DRIVERS AS WELL 
COULD YOU SPARE A FEW HOURS ONE SUNDAY A MONTH 
TO TAKE SOMEONE TO TEA OR HOST THE OCCASIONAL GATHERING AT HOME 
ALL YOU NEED IS A DOWNSTAIRS LOO AND A BIG TEAPOT 
IT'S REALLY MADE MY LIFE COMING HERE 
I DON'T GO OUT VERY MUCH SO THIS IS A PLEASURE TO ME 
SOMEWHERE TO GO FOR AN AFTERNOON 
YES I ENJOY IT VERY MUCH 
AND EVERYBODY'S SO KIND AND FRIENDLY 
AND EVEN 
EVEN IF THEY RING YOU UP AND THEY WANT TO DO ANYTHING FOR YOU 
THEY DO THEY CAN'T BE MORE HELPFUL 
WE'VE GOT A REALLY NICE GROUP OF PEOPLE HERE 
AND IT'S A REALLY ENJOYABLE THING ONCE A MONTH 
CONTACT THE ELDERLY DO A GREAT JOB

WHO ARE TOO FRAIL TO GO OUT ON THEIR OWN 
AND HERE'S A DEVASTATING STATISTIC
