YEARS INVOLVED EIGHTY ONE HEARINGS AND SEVEN HUNDRED 
SUBMISSIONS BUT THE COMPETITION 
COMMISSION HAS FINALLY PUBLISHED 
ITS REPORT INTO THE GROCERY SECTOR 
THEY SAY THE BIG SUPERMARKETS OFFER 
A GOOD DEAL TO THE CUSTOMERS THEY 
ARE RECOMMENDING A CHANGE TO THE 
PLANNING SYSTEM AND AN OMBUDSMAN TO 
PROTECT SUPPLIERS YOU HAVE BEEN 
LOOKING AT THIS IT TODAY THEY HAVE 
BEEN LOOKING AT THIS FOR A LONG 
TIME 
THE INDUSTRY IS ACTUALLY TIME WORTH TWELVE THREE BILLION MATTERS THE 
SIZE OF THE ENTIRE MARKET THE FOUR 
BIT PLAYERS MAKE UP SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THAT 
THE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN GOING ON 
FOR QUITE A WHILE IT WAS IN A TWO THOUSAND SIX 
THAT BEAT OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING 
REFERRED THE GROCERY MARKET TO DE 
COMPETITION COMMISSION IN OCTOBER 
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE COMMISSION PUBLISHED 
THEIR PRELIMINARY FINDINGS THEY 
SAID THEY FOUND THAT TESCO THE 
BIGGEST PLAYER IN THE MARKET THEY 
SAID THEY WERE NOT ACTUALLY 
STOPPING COMPETITORS FROM GROWING 
THEY ALSO SAID THAT TESCO AND 
SAINSBURY'S MOVE INTO THE 
CONVENIENCE STORE MARKET WAS NOT 
STOPPING COMPETITION TWO MONTHS 
AGO THEY DELIVERED WHAT THEY CALL 
THEIR PROVISIONAL DECISION ON 
REMEDIES THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE 
PROBABLY GOING TO SAY IN THEIR 
FINAL REPORT LOOK AT IT AND GIVE 
US SOME FEEDBACK THEY HAVE 
PUBLISHED THE FINAL REPORT TODAY 
THERE ARE MANY INTERESTED PARTIES 
THERE ARE SMALL SHOPKEEPERS AND 
SUPERMARKETS WHO ARE THE WINNERS 
AND LOSERS 
THE BIG PLAYERS ARE 
TRYING TO MAKE OUT THAT THEY HAVE 
COME OUT ON TOP ASDA HAS SAID THAT 
AFTER ANOTHER EXHAUSTIVE 
INVESTIGATION THEY HAVE REACHED 
THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY PROVIDE A 
GOOD DEAL FOR CUSTOMERS TESCO HAS 
ALSO REFERRED TO THE FACT THAT THEY 
ARE DELIVERING A GOOD DEAL TO 
CUSTOMERS THEY ARE GROWING TIRED 
OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS ROB HAS 
BEEN TO A LOCAL CONVENIENCE STORE 
IN STOURBRIDGE IN THE WEST MIDLANDS 
TO GET THEIR REACTION 
LET'S MEET 
SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY 
THIS IS YOUR DAUGHTER MANDY IS IT 
TOUGH BUSINESS 
AT THE MOMENT I 
WOULD SAY YES HE TEARS GOING BACK 
SOME YEARS WHEN MUM AND DAD FIRST 
STARTED IT WAS A LOT EASIER IT 
IS WE HAVE GOT SAINSBURY'S ABOUT A 
MILE AWAY AND WE HAVE GOT THE MERRY 
HILL CENTRE WHERE THERE ARE QUITE A 
FEW SUPERMARKETS IT DOES MEAN THAT 
HOUR OPENING HOURS HAVE HAD TO 
INCREASE AND WE HAVE GOT TO DO 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE 
DID TEN YEARS AGO 
WHAT TOWERS ARE 
YOU OPEN 
WE OPEN MONDAY TO 
SATURDAY SEVEN A M. TILL NINE P. M. AND ON 
SUNDAY NINE A M. UNTIL NINE P. M. 
HOW HAS THIS 
BUSINESS CHANGED 
BEFORE THAT IT 
HAD NOT CHANGED MY HUSBAND AND I 
WORKED HERE NOW THERE IS SO MUCH 
COMPETITION IN STOURBRIDGE THEY 
HAVE GOT QUITE A FEW SUPERMARKETS 
TOUCH WOOD IT IS HARD WORK BUT WE 
ARE DOING ALL RIGHT WE ARE HAPPY 
WITH THE CUSTOMERS WHEN THE 
CUSTOMERS COME IN WE SMILE AND 
THINGS LIKE THAT TOUCH WOOD WE 
ARE DOING ALL RIGHT 
WHEN I CAME IN 
I GOT TO AIM REALLY FRIENDLY SMILE 
AND A WELCOME 
WHEN THE CUSTOMERS 
COME IN WEEK GIVE THEM A SMILE IT 
IS THE FIRST IMPRESSION ON THEM 
WHEN THEY COME IN WE GIVE THEM A 
KIP SERVICE WE KNOW THEIR FAMILIES 
AND THEIR KIDS GOOD WE ARE VERY 
FRIENDLY WITH OUR CUSTOMERS THAT 
IS PART OF OUR BUSINESS AS WELL WE 
GIVE THEM A WARM WELCOME WHEN THEY 
COME IN 
I WILL BE BACK IN A FEW 
MINUTES I'M GOING TO SPEAK TO THE 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE OF 
CONVENIENCE STORES 
IT IS 
VERY WELL TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO 
PROVIDE A COMMUNITY SERVICE IF 
STALLS LIKE THIS CANNOT COMPETE 
THE ECONOMICS DO NOT STACK UP DO 
THEY 
THE COMPETITION COMMISSION THEY HAS FOUND SOME REAL PROBLEMS THEY 
ARE AT A DISADVANTAGE IT IS NOT A 
LEVEL PLAYING FIELD THEY HAVE NOT 
DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND HAVE NOT 
PUSHED FORWARD REMEDIES DID DEAL 
WITH IT SUPERSTORES HAVE DOMINATED 
THE PLANNING SYSTEM TWO NEW LARGE 
STORES HAVE BEEN BUILT NOT ONE OF 
THEM HAVE BEEN BUILT BY AN 
INDEPENDENT IT IS ABOUT MAIN STORE 
DEVELOPMENT THEY HAVE NOT SEEN THE 
PROBLEMS IT WILL LEAD TO IN THE 
FUTURE 
SMALL SHOPS LIKE THIS HAVE FUTURE ONLY GOT THEMSELVES TO BLAME FOR 
DEBATE CHARGE HIGH PRICES THESE THESE STORES ARE PRETTY COMPETITIVE 
BLAMED A CHARGE L. THINK WHAT THEY 
CAN OFFER IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON 
THEY HAVE ENROLLED IN THE COMMUNITY 
THERE ARE AN ESSENTIAL COMMUNITY 
SERVICE THEY ARE MEETING POINTS 
AND THE PROVISION OF GOODS AND 
SERVICES AND SO ONE IT IS ON THAT 
POINT OF DIFFERENCE THAT WE HAVE TO 
LOOK FORWARD TO 
THE COMPETITION 
COMMISSION HAS DECIDED THAT 
CUSTOMERS ARE GETTING A FAIR DEAL 
THIS IS NOT A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH 
FOR SUPERSTORES THERE ARE SOME 
REAL PROBLEMS THERE ARE ISSUES 
THEY HAVE CONCLUDED THAT 
COMPETITION IS WORKING FOR 
CONSUMERS THAT HAS NOT TAKEN INTO 
ACCOUNT RETAILERS LIKE THIS AND 
WHAT THEY DO IT HAS NOT TAKEN INTO 
ACCOUNT THE VALUE OF CHOICE 
CONSUMERS WANT CHOICE AND DIVERSITY 
IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT COMPETITION 
BETWEEN FOUR MASSIVE MULTIPLES IT 
IS ABOUT OFFERING SOMETHING 
DIFFERENT AND OFFERING CHOICE VERY VERY OBVIOUS FROM ROB'S INTERVIEWS THAT 
THE ASSOCIATION OF CONVENIENCE TO 
WAS IS 
NOT HAPPY 
ABOUT 
IT WHAT 
WAS 
IN THE FINE PRINT AND TEACH HELP 
DETAIL 
WE HAVE HAD EXTENSIVE DETAIL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE 
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CONVENIENCE 
SECTOR WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT 
THE PICTURE IS VERY MIXED AND THAT 
THE SMALL SHOP SECTOR IS NOT IN 
TERMINAL DECLINE CONDITIONS ARE 
TOUGH COMPETITION IS TOUGH FOUR 
AN ATTRACTIVE AND INTERESTING 
PROPOSITION CONSUMERS WILL GO 
THERE I DO NOT SEE THE SMALL SHOPS 
SECTOR DECLINING 
CLEAR EVIDENCE 
THAT COMPETITION IS ALIVE AND 
KICKING 
THEY HAVE SAID THERE IS A KICKING GOOD CHOICE AND STRONG COMPETITION 
THEY HAVE SAID THERE ARE AREAS 
WHERE THERE ARE LIMITATIONS THE 
PROPOSALS THEY HAVE COME UP WITH 
STARTING WITH CHANGES TO THE 
PLANNING SYSTEM THEY WANT TO TRY 
TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR ONE 
CHAIN TO BECOME DOMINANT IN A DISH 
IN A LOCAL AREA THEY WANT PLANS TO 
BE RUN PAST THE OFFICE OF FAIR 
TRADING AND TO UNDERGO A 
COMPETITION TEST A ALSO TOUCHED ON 
THE ISSUE OF LAND BANKING THEY 
ALSO SOMETIMES THEY WILL HOLD ONTO 
THE LAND AND SOMETIMES THEY WILL 
SELL IT ON BUT RESTRICTIONS FOR 
INSTANCE THEY WILL STOP OTHER 
SUPERMARKETS BUYING THE LAND IT 
SUPERMARKETS DO SELL THEY WILL NOT 
BE ABLE TO PLACE RESTRICTIONS ON IT 
ANYMORE IF SUPERMARKETS THEY 
HAVE RECOMMENDED A STRONGER CODE OF 
PRACTICE WHICH WOULD COVER GROCERY 
RETAILERS WITH AN ANNUAL TURNOVER 
OF MORE THAN ONE BILLION THEY HAVE 
PROPOSED AN OMBUDSMAN TO TRY TO 
ENFORCE THAT PRACTICE HE WOULD BE 
ABLE TO INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS BY 
SUPPLIERS TO SUPERMARKETS AND ALSO 
BE ABLE TO FIND SUPERMARKETS PULLS 
UP THERE IS SOME CONFUSION ABOUT 
HERE BUT BE PAYING FOR THIS SYSTEM 
SUPERMARKETS THESE ARE 
THEY ARE NOT GUARANTEED THE 
COMMISSION IS HOPEFUL THAT THESE 
PROPOSALS WILL COME INTO PRACTICE 
THEY CANNOT SEE IT HAPPENING IN 
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
WITH ASDA THEY SAID THAT THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OMBUDSMAN COSTS MIGHT BE PASSED TO 
THE CONSUMER AFTER THE 
INVESTIGATION IT SOUNDS AS IF THE 
COMPETITION COMMISSION HAS WRAPPED 
IT UP THERE IS ANOTHER INQUIRY ON 
THE HORIZON IT IS ABOUT PRICE 
FIXING AND THE OFT 
WE HAVE GOT 
WIND OF THAT THE OFT IS LOOKING 
INTO ALLEGED TO PRICE FIXING 
ACTIVITIES THESE ARE DIFFERENT 
ISSUES THE COMPETITION COMMISSION 
IS LOOKING AT COMPETITION AND THE 
LFT IS LOOKING AT ALLEGED PRICE 
FIXING JUST BECAUSE THE 
SUPERMARKETS HAVE BEEN CLEARED OF 
ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICES IT DOES 
NOT MEAN THEY ARE CLEAR OF ANYTHING 
ELSE 
FIGURES FROM THE NATIONWIDE ELSE HAVE INCREASED FEARS ABOUT THE 
HOUSING MARKET THEIR FIGURES 
SHOWED THE FIRST NEWLY FALL IN HOME 
PRICES SINCE MARCH NINETEEN NINETY SIX THE ANNUAL 
CHANGE SHOWS THAT HOME PRICES FELL 
BY ONE PER CENT THAT IS FASCINATING AND I 
WILL COME TO READ IN A MOMENT THIS 
FOLLOWS A DAY AFTER THE BANK OF 
ENGLAND SAID THAT OVERALL APPROVALS 
FOR NEW HOMES FELL BY NOT ONE PER CENT BUT 
BY ELEVEN PER CENT CLOSE TO THE LEVELS OF 
HOUSING PROBLEMS OF NINETEEN NINETY TWO ONE OF 
THE EFFECTS OF THE CREDIT CRUNCH IS 
THAT BANKS HAVE NOT FULLY PASSED ON 
INTEREST RATE CUTS ALMOST HALF OF 
MORTGAGES ARE ON FIXED RATES 
FORTY SEVEN PER CENT OF MORTGAGES ARE ON FIXED 
RATES THEY DO NOT TRACK THE CUT IN 
BASE RATES ONLY TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT OF MORTGAGES 
CUT THAT HOWEVER EVEN WITH THE 
HEADLINE GRABBING FALL IN HOME 
PRICES FEW PEOPLE SHOULD BE 
IMMEDIATELY AFFECTED BY THIS IF 
YOU BOUGHT A HOUSE LAST YEAR AND 
HAVE JUST SOLD IT AGAIN YOU MAY 
HAVE LOST MONEY AS A RESULT OVER 
THE LONG TERM PRICES ARE UP IN 
THE PAST BEDS HAVE A LOOK AT THE 
HOUSE PRICES IN THE PAST FOUR 
YEARS HOUSE PRICES HAVE RISEN BY 
TWENTY TWO PER CENT YOU HAVE GOT TO PUT THAT ONE PER CENT 
FALL INTO THAT CONTEXT L. AM JOINED 
BY THE CHIEF ECONOMIST AT THE 
NATIONWIDE HOW SERIOUS IS THIS ONE PER CENT 
PRICE FALL 
WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS IN CONTEXT 
PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST TWO TO 
THREE YEARS WHEN WE HAVE SEEN 
DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THERE 
ARE NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT WE 
KNEW WERE GOING TO WEAKEN THE 
MARKET WE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED 
MODEST FALLS THAT IS LIKE 
DECREASED AFFORDABILITY IT IS 
GREAT CHANGE SINCE AUTUMN OF LAST 
YEAR WE HAD THE TROUBLES WITH 
NORTHERN ROCK AND THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
ISSUES THAT IS ALL COMING TOGETHER 
AND IS CAUSING DEMAND IN THE MARKET 
JUST AS YOU MENTIONED THAT THE BANK 
OF ENGLAND TO WEAKEN THAT IS 
PUTTING PRESSURE ON HOUSE PRICES 
AGAIN 
YOUR REPORT SEEMED TO BE AGAIN SUGGESTING THAT BECAUSE SUCH A 
LARGE GROUP 
OF PEOPLE ON THE FIXED 
RATES WHEN 
THEY COME OFF THEY MAY BE GETTING A BETTER DEAL 
THINGS MIGHT NOT BE AS BAD AS THEY 
FIRST SEEM HAVE THEY UNDERSTOOD 
WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING CUSTOMER 
OF THEY ARE TWO PARTS OF THE MARKET 
THERE ARE LOTS OF TALKS ABOUT 
MORTGAGE RATES BEING HIGHER THAN 
THEY WERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FACE 
A PAYMENT SHOCK WHEN THEY COME A 
FIXED RATE DEALS IT WILL BE 
DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO FIND A DEAL 
WHICH MATCHES WHAT THEY HAVE HAD IN 
THE PAST WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE 
MAJORITY OF BORROWERS THEY WILL 
HAVE BENEFITED ONE FOR ONE AT ALL 
WELL HAVE HAD NO CHANGE IT IS A 
SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF PEOPLE 
WHO ARE NOT TOUCHED BY WHAT IS 
HAPPENING AT THE FRONT END OF THE 
MARKET THERE IS SPECIAL 
LIQUIDITY SCHEME WHICH HAS BEEN 
LAUNCHED BY THE BANK THIS SHOULD 
HELP TO LOOSEN UP CONDITIONS IN THE 
FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT SHOULD HELP 
TO IMPROVE MATTERS 
ONE OF THE BIG 
CONCERNS IS THAT IF HOUSE PRICES 
FALL IT STOPS PEOPLE SPENDING IF 
THEY ARE NOT SELLING THEIR HOME 
THEY FEEL POORER 
IF YOU HAVE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF 
EQUITY IN YOUR PROPERTY YOU ARE 
LIKELY TO FEEL WEALTHIER BUT IT IS 
NOT JUST THE HOUSING MARKET THAT 
MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE THAT AND 
THINGS THAT DRIVE THE HOUSING 
MARKET ALSO DRIVES THE ECONOMY SO 
IF THE ECONOMY IS STRONG WE'RE ALL 
WEALTHIER AND THAT PUSHES UP DEMAND 
FOR HOUSES SO THERE ARE COUPLE 
OF THINGS THAT DRIVE BOTH THE 
HOUSING MARKET AND THE ECONOMY AS 
WE KNOW AT THE MOMENT THE ECONOMY 
IS WEAKENING AND WE EXPECT IT TO 
WEAKEN FURTHER AND THAT WILL PUT 
DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON PEOPLE'S 
SPENDING AT THE MOMENT SO IT IS 
PARTLY THE HOUSING MARKET AND 
PARTLY THE ECONOMY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO 
US WERE YOU BEING TETCHY 
US WERE YOU BEING TETCHY THEN WHEN YOUR GRAPHICS WEREN'T WORKING 
STAY THERE BECAUSE THE U. S. ECONOMY 
GREW AT SLIGHTLY FASTER PACE THAN 
EXPECTED EARLIER IN THE YEAR SOME 
HAD BEEN EXPECTING A SLIGHT FALL 
AND A CUTBACK IN U. S. SPENDING BUT 
LATER THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL 
ANNOUNCE WHETHER IT WILL MAKE A 
FURTHER CUT IN INTEREST RATES THE 
B. B. C. HAS LEARNT THAT TESCO IS IN 
TALKS TO SELL ITS INTERNET PROPERTY 
BUSINESS TO ONE OF ITS FIERCEST 
CRITICS LAST SUMMER TESCO OFFERED 
CUSTOMERS TO SELL THEIR PROPERTIES 
ON LINE FOR JUST TWO HUNDRED BUT ONE OF 
THE MOST VOCAL OPPONENTS 
SPICERHAART IS NOW WORKING WITH 
THEM TO CREATE VIRTUAL ESTATE 
AGENCY BUSINESS AND A. S. A. SAYS IT 
RECEIVED A RECORD NUMBER OF FOURTEEN THOUSAND 
COMPLAINTS LAST YEAR WITH 
GOVERNMENT ANTI SMOKING CAMPAIGN 
SHOWING SMOKERS ARE FISH HOOKS 
THROUGH THEIR CHEEKS DREW THE MOST 
CRITICISM CRITICISM THERE ARE RESULTS FROM HOME RETAIL 
THIS MORNING IT OWNS ARGOS AND 
HOME BASE AND THERE IS A SENSE 
THAT IF PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO MOVE 
HOMES THEY MIGHT SPEND MORE ON 
DOING UP THEIR CURRENT HOMES AND 
THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THOSE SORTS 
OF COMPANIES THAT IS A LOVELY 
THEORY BUT THE STOCK MARKET 
DOESN'T RECKON MUCH ON IT BECAUSE 
LOOK AT THE SHARES 
THEY HAVE ALMOST HALVED IN VALUE 
OVER JUST A YEAR SUBSTANTIALLY 
WORSE THAN THE MARKET AVERAGE THE 
F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED BUT IN LINE WITH SOME OF 
THE OTHER RETAILERS D. S. G. THE OLD 
DIXONS GROUP LOST FIFTY NINE PER CENT AND MARKS AND AMP 
SPENCER LOST FORTY NINE PER CENT OF ITS VALUE 
FRIGHTENING STUFF HAPPENING IN THE 
RETAIL SECTOR OF THE STOCK MARKET 
ANY WAY HOME RETAIL HAS ANNOUNCED 
THAT PROFITS ARE UP FOURTEEN PER CENT SO VERY NICE PERFORMANCE UNDERLYING AND 
ARE UP TODAY AND QUITE 
A BIT NINE PER CENT UP SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE THAT IS REALLY 
GOOD GOOD KINK FISHER THEY ARE THE BIGGEST 
COMPETITOR THEY OWN B. AND AMP Q. AND THEY 
ARE UP FIFTEEN PER CENT AND THE OTHER SHARES 
FROM THAT WE MIGHT SEE A F. T. S. E. ONE HUNDRED 
UP NOW ANTOFAGASTA HAVE ANNOUNCED 
A QUARTERLY RISE IN COPPER 
PRODUCTION BUT THE MINING SECTOR 
IS THE BEST PERFORMING SHARES ON 
THAT SECTOR OF THE MARKETS L. WAS 
TALKING ABOUT HBOS YESTERDAY AND 
THE RIGHTS ISSUE A NUMBER HAVE 
WRITTEN TO ME TO ASK QUESTIONS 
ABOUT THAT THE PROBLEM FOR LOT 
OF PEOPLE IS THAT IF YOU DO NOTHING 
HERE THE VALUE OF YOUR SHARES FALL 
BUT TO BUY MORE SHARES YOU NEED 
MORE MONEY DAVID RILEY HAS 
CLEVER SUGGESTION 
HE SAYS 
IN OTHER WORDS WHY NOT SELL SOME 
OF YOUR RIGHTS TO THE NEW SHARES 
AND WITH THE CASH YOU GET FROM THAT 
BUY SOME OF THE NEW SHARES SO YOU 
DON'T HAVE TO STUMP UP ANY OF YOUR 
OWN MONEY THIS MIGHT WORK BECAUSE 
IF SHAREHOLDERS DON'T WANT TO BUY 
NEW SHARES THEY CAN ACTUALLY SELL 
THE RIGHT TO BUY YOU'RE SELLING 
NOT THE SHARE BUT THE RIGHT TO BUY 
THE RIGHT HAS MONETARY VALUE IN 
ITSELF THE HBOS SHARE REGISTRAR 
SAYS FOR ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS THIS 
STRATEGY SHOULD BE POSSIBLE BUT IF 
YOU HAVE SHARES IN AN ISA OR ANY 
OTHER WAY OF HOLDING THEM IT IS 
WORTH TAKING ADVICE BECAUSE 
PARTICULAR RULES MIGHT APPLY 
HBOS SHARES ARE DOWN TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
I THOUGHT THE F. T. S. E. MIGHT BE UP AND 
I'M RIGHT 
THERE MAY BE A CREDIT CRUNCH GOING 
ON BUT NOT EVERYONE IS SUFFERING 
ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION OF PAWNBROKERS SEVEN A PER CENT 
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY PER CENT OF THEIR MEMBERS SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF 
THEIR MEMBERS HAVE SHOWN AN 
INCREASE IN ACTIVITY 
THIS IS PAWNBROKER T. M. SUTTON 
ESTABLISHED IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY AND ON THIS 
SITE IN LONDON'S VICTORIA SINCE 
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED THE GROUP DIRECT YOR JIM 
DIRECTOR JIM TANYA HILL HAS WORKED 
WITH THE COMPANY ALL HIS LIFE 
IF I GO TO ANY ONE OF THE DRAWS 
HERE YOU HAVE SOME PARCELS EACH 
ONE IS TICKETED AND LABELLED WITH 
THE CUSTOMER'S NAME AND THE AMOUNT 
WE'VE LENT AND THEIR AGREEMENT WE 
HAVE HERE A LOAN FOR ONE THOUSAND AND 
ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED AND SO ON 
AND HOW 
MANY OF THESE PLEDGES MIGHT YOU 
HAVE AT ONCE IN THE OFFICE 
AT ANY 
ONE TIME WE'VE PROBABLY GOT ABOUT 
THREE THOUSAND PLEDGES OUT 
AND IT'S NOT 
JUST JEWELLERY THEY TAKE IN 
ORNAMENTS AND PAINTINGS ARE SAFELY 
WRAPPED UP BUT WHO USES THE 
SERVICES OF A PAWNBROKER IN THE 
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY 
IF I HAD TO PIN A 
TREND OR A MOVEMENT IT'S PROBABLY 
MORE LADIES NOW THAN BEFORE L. 
SUPPOSE YOUNG PEOPLE BUYING THEIR 
OWN JEWELLERY AND THEN HAVE A 
COMMODITY THEY CAN USE TO RAISE 
MONEY AGAINST 
HERE AT SUTTONS A CUSTOMER COMES 
INTO BOOTH LIKE THIS TO DO 
THEIR DEAL THEY ARE LENT AROUND 
THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE RETAIL VALUE OF THEIR 
PROPERTY THE STANDARD TERM FOR 
LOAN IS SIX MONTHS AND AFTER THOSE 
SIX MONTHS EIGHTY NINE PER CENT OF THOSE CUSTOMERS 
COME BACK TO COLLECT THEIR GOODS 
WHAT IS THIS 
SOME TYPICAL THINGS 
WOULD BE CARTIER WATCHES AND LOVE 
BANGLES A TYPICAL PIECE THERE IS A 
DIAMOND LINE BRACELET AND A 
GENTLEMAN'S CUFF LINKS SOMETHING 
WE DON'T SEE MUCH OF THESE DAYS ARE 
GOLD LIGHTERS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS 
IT SEEMS THE VARIETY OF GOODS 
COMING IN OVER THE YEARS HAS NOT 
CHANGED MUCH SO WHY HAVE SUTTONS 
AND THEIR SISTER STORE ROBERTS 
SONS TOGETHER SEEN A TWENTY FIVE PER CENT INCREASE 
IN BUSINESS OVER THE PAST TWELVE 
MONTHS 
THE POPULATION CULTURE HAS MONTHS CHANGED WITHOUT DOUBT LONDON HAS 
BECOME VERY MULTI CULTURAL AND THE 
PEOPLE WHO COME TO LONDON ARE VERY 
PORTABLE AND THERE HAS TO BE A 
CREDIT CRUNCH WE'RE SEEING REPEAT 
CUSTOMERS THAT POSSIBLY HAVEN'T 
BEEN FOR A WHILE AND THEY'RE NOW 
COMING BACK L. THINK THERE IS EVEN 
A POSSIBILITY THAT CASH IS NOW 
MAKING A LITTLE BIT OF A RESURGENCE 
IF YOU WANT TO PAWN SOMETHING YOU 
TYPICALLY NEED TWO FORMS OF 
IDENTIFICATION SUCH AS A PASSPORT 
DRIVING LICENCE OR UTILITY BILL 
YOU'LL SIGN AND RECEIVE A COPY OF 
CONTRACT WITH DETAILS OF YOUR 
RIGHTS AND PROTECTION UNDER THE 
CONSUMER CRED ITY ACT AT SUTTONS 
YOU'LL BE CHARGED FOUR PER CENT INTEREST ON 
THE RATE OF YOUR PLEDGE BUT THESE 
VARY VARY YOU CAN COLLECT THE ITEM EARLY 
WITHOUT ANY SORT OF REDEMPTION 
PENALTY BUT IF YOU DON'T COLLECT 
IT AT THE END OF YOUR CONTRACT IT 
WILL BE SOLD BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION 
AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IS OUT ON LOAN 
FROM PAWNBROKERS AT THE MOMENT 
WITH THE CREDIT CRUNCH AND AS BANKS 
TIGHTEN UP THEIR RULES THESE SMALL 
BUSINESSES COULD BE IN POSITION 
TO BENEFIT TOMORROW ON WORKING 
LUNCH WE'LL HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE 
REPORT ON SO CALLED BOILER ROOM 
SCAMS WHERE PEOPLE ARE ENCOURAGED 
TO SPEND THOUSANDS OF POUNDS 
INVESTING IN SHARES THAT EITHER 
DON'T EXIST OR ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO 
SELL WE'LL MEET A MAN WHO HAS MADE 
THOUSANDS OF POUNDS WORKING IN A 
BOILER ROOM AND ONE COUPLE THAT 
WERE VICTIMS 
IT STARTED OFF 
INVESTING FOUR THOUSAND A LOT OF PEOPLE 
WILL INVEST FOUR THOUSAND AND THAT'S HOW 
IT STARTED AND THEN IT GREW AND 
GREW AND THEN IT WAS LIKE YOU'RE 
DRAWN INTO IT AND THEN WHEN THEY 
SAY WELL THAT'S EIGHT THOUSAND THAT 
YOU'VE INVESTED IS NOW WORTH 
EIGHTY THOUSAND IT'S EASY WHEN HE SAY 
YOU'LL GET THAT BACK INTO YOUR BANK 
ACCOUNT IT'S DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE 
NOT TO GET DRAWN IN 
AND DO YOU 
WANT A HOT TIP ON A NICE LITTLE 
EARNER IT COULD LAND YOU IN A HEAP 
OF TROUBLE BECAUSE THE FINANCIAL 
SERVICES AUTHORITY IS PLEDGING TO 
CRACK DOWN ON INSIDER TRADING 
JOINING US IS DAVID BUICK FROM B. C. G. 
PARTNERS AND DAVID KEO FROM FOOL 
U. K. U. K. AND IS INSIDER TRADING AS COMMON AS 
IT SEEMS 
IT IS NOT AS COMMON AS IT 
WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN IT WAS 
RAMPANT TODAY COMPLIANCE OFFICERS 
WORKING IN THE BANKS AND THE 
STOCKBROKERS ARE VIGILANT THE F. S. A. 
HAS TIGHTENED UP THE SITUATION VERY 
VERY HARD YOU CAN'T SAY IT DOESN'T 
HAPPEN OF COURSE IT HAPPENS BUT 
ACTUALLY THE WAY IT HAPPENS IS 
NOTHING LIKE WHAT IT WAS THE 
TROUBLE IS WHEN SITUATIONS DO 
OCCUR THESE DAYS IT BECOMES VERY 
PARTNER THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAVE 
HAPPENED BECAUSE IT HAPPENS SO 
LITTLE COMPARED TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS DAVID DAVID KEO IT IS FOOLCO.UK DO YOU THINK 
WE HAVE CLAMPED DOWN ON IT OR IS 
IT STILL VERY PREVALENT 
IT IS 
STILL ON OUR DISCUSSION BOARDS AND 
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS INQUIRYING WHY 
SHARES ARE RISING OR FALLING FOR 
INSTANCE THERE WAS ONE COMPANY 
THAT FELL TEN PER CENT AND OUR MEMBERS WERE 
E. MAILING IN AND SAYING WHAT IS 
GOING ON AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THE 
NEXT DAY THAT THE OIL DRILLING 
COMPANY HAD HIT A DRY WELL AND 
PEOPLE WERE SAYING WHO KNEW ABOUT 
THIS FOR THE SHARTS TO FALL AND 
OBVIOUSLY SHARES TO FALL AND 
OBVIOUSLY SOMEBODY DID KNOW AND AND THE ORDINARY SHAREHOLDESS FEEL THEY 
ARE OUTSIDE THE CLUB AND HAVEN'T 
GOT THE OLD STYLE INFORMATION I I THINK THAT IS UNFAIR L. THINK 
PEOPLE NOW ARE FINANCIALLY MORE 
SAVVY THAN THEY WERE THEY READ THE 
NEWSPAPERS AND GET THE B. B. C. 
PROGRAMMES AND THE OTHER PROGRAMMES 
AND A WIDE VARIETY OF MAGAZINES 
AND WEBSITES SUCH AS DAVID'S AND 
PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE SWITCHED ON 
AND PEOPLE HAVE PLAY HUNCHES LIKE 
YOU COULDN'T HAVE BEEN AN IDIOT IF 
YOU HAD KNOWN LAST YEAR THERE WAS 
GOING TO AN CREDIT CRUNCH AND 
THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT HOUSE 
BUILDERS AND RETAILERS AND THEY'RE 
GOING TO COME SOUTH 
AND WHAT CAN 
PEOPLE DO ABOUT IT 
WHAT WE URGE 
PEOPLE TO DO IS TO BUY SHARES FOR 
THE LONG TERM THE SHORT TERM 
TRADING IS FOR PEOPLE LIKE DAVID 
NOT FOR OUR INVESTORS WE ASK THEM 
TO INVEST FOR A LONG TERM AND THE 
INTERESTING THING ABOUT THAT OIL 
COMPANY IS THAT THE SHARES FELL TEN PER CENT 
BUT NOW THEY ARE BACK UP TO THE 
LEVEL THEY WERE BEFORE THERE ARE 
CERTAIN THINGS LEFT BEST TO THE 
PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING 
AND THE SIMPLEST THING IS TO INVEST 
FOR THE LONG TERM 
THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH WE'LL BE BACK AT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY 
TOMORROW AND WE'LL SEE YOU THEN 
BYE FOR NOW
