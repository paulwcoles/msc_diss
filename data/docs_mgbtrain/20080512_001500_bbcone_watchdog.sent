AND SWIPING THEIR CASH 
THE NEW LAW SUPPOSED TO PROTECT WANNABE MODELS 
SO WHY ARE SOME AGENCIES IGNORING IT 
AND THE SCOTTISH ESTATE WHERE THE NEW HOMES HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON 
THE BOILER THEY'VE GOT COULD EFFECTIVELY EXPLODE 
THAT'S WATCHDOG TONIGHT 
GREAT TO SEE YOU THIS BANK HOLIDAY MONDAY 
WELCOME TO WATCHDOG LIVE 
OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE HAVE TOLD YOU ABOUT SOME MONUMENTAL MISTAKES 
BY GOVERNMENT COMPANIES 
BUT WAIT TILL YOU HEAR THE ONES WE HAVE GOT TODAY 
THE GUILTY PARTY THIS TIME IS THE C. S. A. NO STRANGER TO CONTROVERSY 
AND AMONG THE CASES WE'LL BE HEARING ARE SOME MEN WRONGLY ACCUSED OF FATHERING CHILDREN 
WHEN THEY HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM 
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT CAUSED ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS WITH THEIR WIVES 
EVENTUALLY THE C. S. A. DID ADMIT THEY GOT IT WRONG 
BUT EVEN SO THEY WROTE TO ONE MAN TO SAY THEY'D ALREADY STARTED TAKING MAINTENANCE PAYMENTS 
STRAIGHT OUT OF HIS PENSION 
I SHOWED IT TO JUDITH I WAS SHAKING I WAS NEARLY IN TEARS 
BECAUSE I THOUGHT HANG ON THIS COULD BE MY MARRIAGE AT AN END 
THAT FULL STORY LATER ON 
PLUS MORE ON THOSE BANKS BLOCKING YOUR CARDS WHEN YOU GO ABROAD OR EVEN A LITTLE CLOSER TO HOME 
YOU CAN TEXT US ON ANY OF OUR STORIES 
IT WILL COST THE PRICE OF A STANDARD TEXT 
OR YOU CAN EMAIL US AND WE'LL BE READING THEM OUT LATER 
BUT FIRST LET'S BE HONEST SECOND HAND CAR DEALERS DON'T HAVE THE BEST REPUTATION 
REALLY NO BUT THIS LOT WELL THEY LIKE TO MAKE OUT THEY'RE THE GOOD GUYS 
WITH OVER FIFTY YEARS IN BUSINESS CARCRAFT ARE A LONG WAY FROM YOUR TYPICAL USED CAR DEALER 
THEY'VE GOT ELEVEN HUGE SHOWROOMS ACROSS THE U. K. 
AND THEY'VE SOME BIZARRE ADS ON THE TELLY 
DID YOU KNOW A DUCK'S QUACK HAS NO ECHO 
BUT DID YOU KNOW AT CARCRAFT YOU CAN BROWSE THOUSANDS OF CARS 
FROM OVER FORTY MANUFACTURERS 
THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD BUT DID THEY KNOW THAT WATCHDOG HAS RECEIVED DOZENS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT CARCRAFT 
AND THAT SOME OF THEIR CUSTOMERS WOULD SAY THE CARS THEY BOUGHT JUST AREN'T FIT FOR THE ROAD 
LAST JULY MATT LITTLE PAID CARCRAFT ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
FOR A FOUR YEAR OLD AUDI A THREE 
I DECIDED TO BUY IT FROM CARCRAFT BECAUSE I SEEN THE ADVERTS ON THE TELLY 
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I GOT IT FROM SOMEONE I COULD TRUST 
THAT'S ONE OF CARCRAFT'S MAIN SELLING POINTS 
THEY PROMISE ALL THEIR VEHICLES HAVE AN EXTENSIVE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY POINT INSPECTION BEFORE SALE 
AND THEY'RE SO CONFIDENT ABOUT THE QUALITY THEY THROW IN A THREE MONTH GUARANTEE 
SOON AFTER BUYING THE CAR I NOTICED THERE WAS A FEW STRANGE NOISES 
THERE WAS A CLICKING SOUND COMING FROM UNDER THE BONNET 
WHEN I PUT MY FOOT ON THE THROTTLE THE ENGINE WAS SLUGGISH NO POWER AT ALL IN IT 
MATT HAD TO TAKE THE CAR BACK TO CARCRAFT FOUR TIMES BUT THE PROBLEMS CONTINUED 
BY DECEMBER HE WAS SO FED UP WITH THE RECURRING FAULTS HE ASKED THE DOUBLE A. TO EXAMINE IT 
THEY SENT HIM A REPORT 
I WAS HORRIFIED I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS READING 
THERE WAS A FEW PROBLEMS WITH THE ENGINE GEAR BOX THE DIFFERENTIAL 
SUSPENSION THE PAINT WORK 
THE DOUBLE A. IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF SERIOUS DEFECTS 
WHICH THEY SAID APPEARED TO BE PRESENT AT THE POINT OF PURCHASE 
THEY ALSO FOUND REPORTED FAULTS HAD BEEN CONTINUALLY NOT RECTIFIED 
SINCE THEN CARCRAFT HAVE CARRIED OUT FURTHER REPAIRS THEY'VE EVEN REPLACED THE ENGINE 
BUT MATT'S LOST CONFIDENCE IN THE CAR ALTOGETHER 
I FELT REALLY ANGRY AND BITTER TOWARDS CARCRAFT 
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THEY SOLD ME THE CAR IN THIS CONDITION 
THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN A ONE HUNDRED TWENTY POINT CHECK 
AND I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT EVER HAPPENED WITH THIS CAR 
WE ALL KNOW BUYING A SECOND HAND CAR CAN BE RISKY 
SO IF CARCRAFT'S THREE MONTH GUARANTEE DOESN'T REASSURE YOU 
YOU CAN ALWAYS PAY EXTRA FOR THEIR UPGRADED ONE THEY PROMISE IT GIVES COMPLETE PEACE OF MIND 
BUT SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT IT THINK THEY WERE SOLD A PUP 
HELLO LOLA 
JONATHAN LONG BOUGHT AN AUDI A FOUR FROM CARCRAFT IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FOR EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
HE PAID AN EXTRA ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE FOR AN EXTENDED FOUR YEAR GUARANTEE 
IT SEEMED EXPENSIVE 
BUT IT WAS FOR FOUR YEARS AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD PAY OFF 
IN THE FUTURE ONE WAS TOLD IT COVERED EVERYTHING BY THE SALESPERSON 
BUT TWO MONTHS LATER TWO PARTS ON THE CAR FAILED 
AND CARCRAFT ONLY AGREED TO FIX ONE DESPITE THE FACT BOTH OF THEM 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED UNDER THE GUARANTEE 
I WAS DISGUSTED DUE TO THE FACT THAT BOTH PARTS WERE LISTED ON THE DOCUMENTATION 
I JUST FELT THEY WERE TRYING TO PAY FOR THE CHEAPEST PART 
JONATHAN HAD TO FORK OUT ALMOST ONE THOUSAND TO GET THE PART FIXED 
BUT HE'S HAD MORE PROBLEMS SINCE 
HE EVEN BROKE DOWN ON THE WAY TO THIS INTERVIEW 
THE GUARANTEE I FEEL ISN'T REALLY WORTH ANYTHING 
JONATHAN'S REPAIRS HAVE NOW COST HIM MORE THAN HE PAID FOR HIS GUARANTEE 
BUT WHEN WE CALLED IN CARCRAFT STAFF WERE STILL PROMISING IT COVERS EVERYTHING 
ANOTHER SALESPERSON BACKED THAT UP 
BUT CAR WARRANTY EXPERT GEOFF HUNWICKS ISN'T SURPRISED THESE GUARANTEES DON'T ALWAYS PAY OUT 
GEOFF WHAT'S THE TRUE VALUE OF THESE KINDS OF WARRANTY 
IN MY VIEW NOT A GREAT DEAL 
THE ONLY WARRANTY OF ANY SIGNIFICANT VALUE 
IS THE ONE ISSUED BY THE MANUFACTURER 
MANY OTHER TYPES OF WARRANTIES EXIST 
BUT THEY TEND TO BE A TOOL DESIGNED TO SELL VEHICLES 
SO THEY'RE REASSURANCES AND SELLING TOOLS ESSENTIALLY 
ABSOLUTELY YOU WILL OFTEN FIND THAT THE TERMS AND CONDITION EXCLUDE MORE THAN THEY INCLUDE 
YOU CAN FORGIVE A COMPANY SELLING YOU ONE CAR WITH PROBLEMS 
BUT TWO OR EVEN THREE 
WELL THAT'S REALLY GOING TO GET YOUR GOAT 
VALERIE GAYTHORPE LIVES IN AN ISOLATED YORKSHIRE VILLAGE 
SHE BOUGHT A MAZDA SIX IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
A FEW DAYS LATER 
WE WERE DRIVING ALONG MY SON AND I AND HE NOTICED 
THERE WAS SMOKE COMING FROM THE DASHBOARD 
VALERIE RETURNED THE CAR TO CARCRAFT AND AN ENGINEER TOOK A LOOK 
WHEN THEY TOOK THE DASHBOARD AWAY THE CIRCUIT BOARDS HAD DISINTEGRATED IN HIS HAND 
VALERIE WANTED HER MONEY BACK BUT INSTEAD CARCRAFT SAID SHE COULD CHOOSE A REPLACEMENT 
SHE WENT FOR A VAUXHALL SIGNUM BUT THAT SOON DEVELOPED A FAULT TOO 
I'D HAD THE CAR A FEW DAYS I WAS DRIVING ALONG THE MOTORWAY ABOUT SEVENTY MILES AN HOUR 
AND SUDDENLY THE VEHICLE JUST LOST POWER 
I DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT WAS WRONG 
I WAS FRIGHTENED TO DEATH BECAUSE I WAS SURROUNDED BY LORRIES AND HEAVY TRAFFIC 
THIS TIME VAL DEMANDED HER MONEY BACK CARCRAFT SAID NO AND OFFERED HER ANOTHER REPLACEMENT 
A RENAULT LAGUNA 
BUT TEN WEEKS LATER THAT ONE HAD TO BE TOWED AWAY 
I'LL NEVER EVER EVER BUY ANOTHER VEHICLE FROM CARCRAFT 
I'M TOTALLY DISGUSTED WITH THEM 
AND ALL I WANT IS THE MONEY BACK 
MM CARCRAFT NOW YOU KNOW 
YEP NOW YOU KNOW THAT MAYBE CARCRAFT ISN'T ALWAYS AS DIFFERENT 
FROM ALL THE OTHER USED CAR DEALERS AS THEY LIKE TO MAKE OUT 
EH 
WELL CARCRAFT DISPUTE SOME OF THE DETAILS 
BUT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ON WHAT THEY CALL RARE OCCASIONS THEY CAN FAIL TO MEET THEIR USUAL STANDARDS 
THEY SELL OVER NINETY THOUSAND CARS A YEAR AND ARE CONFIDENT THE QUALITY OF THE VEHICLES 
GUARANTEES AND SERVICE STANDS UP AGAINST ANY OTHER RETAILER 
AND AFTER WE GOT INVOLVED THEY RESOLVED ALL THE CASES IN OUR FILM 
WHICH THEY SAY HAPPENED BEFORE IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR SERVICE 
TWO HAVE RETURNED THEIR CARS AND GOT A FULL REFUND 
WHILE THE THIRD WILL BE REIMBURSED FOR REPAIRS NOT COVERED BY THE GUARANTEE 
THEY SAY THE GUARANTEE DOESN'T COVER EVERYTHING AND STAFF SHOULDN'T SAY THAT IT DOES 
THOUGH OF COURSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID WHEN WE CALLED IN 
WELL NEXT WHEN WE'VE LOOKED AT BOILER PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY'VE BEEN ANNOYING EXPENSIVE TO FIX 
BUT THIS ONE COULD EVEN BE DANGEROUS 
YOUR HOME SHOULD BE A SAFE HAVEN BUT THE RESIDENTS OF THIS ESTATE 
KNOW THEIR FOUR WALLS MIGHT ALSO BE HOME TO A TICKING TIME BOMB 
THE CARMUIR ESTATE WAS BUILT IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE BY SCOTTISH COMPANY DRUMBOW HOMES 
THE TWENTY NEW BUILD HOUSES ARE IN A REMOTE PART OF LANARKSHIRE 
WITH NO MAINS GAS SUPPLY SO THE DEVELOPERS INSTALLED ELECTRIC BOILERS 
WITH DEVASTATING RESULTS 
ESPECIALLY ONE EVENING IN FEBRUARY FOR JACKIE DYAS AT NUMBER TEN 
ABOUT HALF PAST EIGHT I STARTED TO NOTICE 
THAT THE HOUSE WAS GETTING REALLY WARM 
MUCH WARMER THAN NORMAL BUT I THOUGHT THE BOILER'S GOING OFF AT NINE ANYWAY WITH THE TIMER 
SO WE'LL JUST LEAVE IT 
BUT THE BOILER HAD OTHER IDEAS TEN MINUTES AFTER IT WAS PROGRAMMED 
TO TURN OFF IT WAS STILL RUNNING 
THE BOILER WAS SHAKING AND BY THEN IT HAD STARTED TO SMOKE 
MY HUSBAND WAS TAKING IN A LOT OF THE FUMES AND COUGHING QUITE BADLY 
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT EDDIE AND MY SON I KNEW WE HAD TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE AND GET SAFE 
I WAS TERRIFIED I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT 
ONCE OUTSIDE THE FAMILY CALLED THE FIRE BRIGADE 
EDDIE WAS SUFFERING FROM SMOKE INHALATION AND HE WAS TREATED WITH OXYGEN AT THE SCENE 
THE FAMILY WERE LUCKY TO GET OUT WHEN THEY DID 
SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THE SCALDING WATER ERUPTED FROM THE BOILER AND FLOODED THEIR HOME 
RESIDENTS ASSUMED THAT THE EVENTS AT NUMBER TEN WERE A ONE OFF 
BUT A MONTH LATER THE SAME THING HAPPENED ACROSS THE ROAD AT NO FIVE 
THE MCKAY FAMILY WERE AWAY AT A FUNERAL 
WHEN THEY RECEIVED AN UNEXPECTED PHONE CALL FROM A NEIGHBOUR 
HE INFORMED US' 
THAT THERE WAS A WATER LEAK IN THE PROPERTY 
HE MANAGED TO TURN THE WATER OFF 
HE ALSO STARTED PUTTING HOLES IN THE CEILING TO ALLOW THE WATER THROUGH 
THE CEILING AT THAT STAGE WAS READY TO COME DOWN 
LUCKILY ENOUGH HE WAS PROACTIVE IN DEALING WITH THE SITUATION 
THE LEAK HAD COME FROM THE BOILER WHICH HAD EFFECTIVELY EXPLODED 
LEAVING BEHIND OVER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND WORTH OF DAMAGE TO THE HOUSE 
WHEN I OPENED THE FRONT DOOR I EXPECTED THE PROPERTY TO BE BAD 
BUT IT WAS ONE HUNDRED TIMES WORSE EVERYTHING WAS BUCKLED 
THE KITCHEN AND BEDROOMS WERE IN A MESS I JUST SUNK 
THIS TIME THE CARMUIR RESIDENTS STARTED TO PANIC BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD THE SAME BOILER 
INSTALLED IN THEIR HOMES 
THEY APPEAR TO BE FIFOS BOILERS FROM THE COMPANY FIFAS 
THOUGH CONFUSINGLY FIFAS HAS TOLD THE HOME OWNERS 
THE BOILERS ARE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM 
EVEN THOUGH IT SEEMS TO BE THEIR LOGO ON THE FRONT 
THE GRAHAMS LIVE AT NO FIFTEEN THEY'VE HAD MINOR PROBLEMS WITH THEIR BOILER SINCE THEY MOVED IN 
SO THE NEIGHBOURS' TROUBLES HAVE LEFT THEM VERY NERVOUS WE'RE EXTREMELY WORRIED 
NOT JUST FOR OURSELVES BUT FOR OUR TWO SMALL CHILDREN 
UPSTAIRS THE CHILDREN'S BEDROOMS ARE AT THE FRONT 
AND OURS IS AT THE BACK WITH THE BOILER IN BETWEEN 
WE'RE TERRIFIED IF SOMETHING WAS TO HAPPEN GETTING ACCESS TO GET THE CHILDREN OUT 
WE SENT EXPERT GORDON MORRIS TO LOOK AT THE GRAHAMS' BOILER 
HE THINKS THERE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES WITH HOW IT WAS INSTALLED BY THE DEVELOPERS 
BUT ALSO BELIEVES THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE BOILER ITSELF 
AND THESE FACTORS COMBINED CREATE A REAL RISK 
IN THIS TYPE OF DOMESTIC INSTALLATION 
THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST THAT I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME 
THERE ARE POTENTIALLY PROBLEMS AND DEFECTS WITHIN THE BOILER 
IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT IS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS 
IT REQUIRES TO BE ATTENDED TO BY THE INSTALLER AND THE BOILER MANUFACTURER 
I WOULD SUGGEST A MATTER OF URGENCY 
WE HAVE HAD THE EXPERT LOOK AT IT NOW WE ARE JUST TERRIFIED 
WE NEED TO GET IT OUT OF THE HOUSE FOR THE SAFETY OF OURSELVES AND THE CHILDREN 
FOR THE RESIDENTS OF THE CARMUIR ESTATE 
ONE QUESTION KEEPS THEM AWAKE AT NIGHT COULD THEIR BOILER BE NEXT 
THE BOILER COMPANY FIFAS HAS TOLD US THEIR BOILERS WOULDN'T EXPLODE 
THEY POINT OUT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY MAKE THEM THEY JUST SUPPLY THEM 
AND THEY CAN'T TRACE THESE ONES AS HAVING COME FROM THEM 
THEY ARE WAITING FOR INFORMATION FROM DRUMBOW HOMES TO CLEAR THAT UP 
DRUMBOW HOMES SAY THAT AS FAR AS THEY'RE CONCERNED 
THEY BOUGHT INSTALLED AND PAID FOR GENUINE FIFAS BOILERS 
FROM A LEGITIMATE SUPPLIER 
DRUMBOW WEREN'T AWARE OF THE EXTENT OF THIS UNTIL WE TOLD THEM THE INSTALLATION WAS DONE BY CONTRACTORS 
THEY STILL USE AND ARE SATISFIED WITH BUT SAFETY IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE AND ALTHOUGH THE WARRANTY IS UP 
THEY'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT INSPECTION FOR ANY CARMUIR RESIDENT WHO WANTS ONE 
MEANWHILE IF YOU CAN SHED ANY LIGHT ON WHAT'S GOING ON HERE LET US KNOW 
YES WE'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU 
NEXT SOME COMPANIES HARDLY DISPLAYING MODEL BEHAVIOUR AND A FEW ARE EVEN BREAKING THE LAW 
THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IS CRYING OUT FOR THE NEXT NEW FACE THE NEXT BIG TALENT 
AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE APPLY FOR THE ROLE 
IF THAT'S YOUR DREAM IMAGINE BEING TOLD 
THAT YOU OR A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY HAS GOT WHAT IT TAKES 
BUT FAME COSTS AND YOU MAY FIND INSTEAD OF HITTING THE BIG TIME 
YOU HAVE BEEN LET DOWN BIG TIME 
IN DECEMBER LAST YEAR CARLIE GRAINGER AND HER PARTNER STEPHEN 
WERE EXTREMELY PROUD WHEN AN ON LINE MODEL AGENCY TOLD THEM 
THEIR SON'S SPARKLING EYES 
MADE HIM IDEAL FOR PHOTOGRAPHIC WORK AND WANTED TO REPRESENT HIM 
I WAS REALLY HAPPY I WAS REALLY CHUFFED THAT A MODELLING AGENCY 
LOOKED AT PHOTOS OF JOSH AND THOUGHT HE WAS GOOD AND HAD THE LOOK 
TO BE A BABY MODEL 
THE AGENCY SEEMED SO POSITIVE THE COUPLE GOT THE IMPRESSION 
THERE WOULD BE PLENTY OF WORK 
BUT TO GET IT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY AN UP FRONT FEE 
OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT 
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT IS A LOT OF MONEY 
BUT THEY SAID HE HAD GOOD POTENTIAL 
WE THOUGHT IT WAS STARTING JOSHUA'S FUTURE 
AS A BABY MODEL SO WE THOUGHT LET'S DO IT 
FOUR MONTHS ON AND JOSH HASN'T BEEN OFFERED ANY MODELLING ASSIGNMENTS 
AND WHY SHOULD HE BE BECAUSE TUCKED AMONG ALL THE PROMISES OF SUCCESS 
THE AGENCY SMALL PRINT SAYS 
THEY DON'T GUARANTEE TO FIND HIM ANY 
EXPERIENCES LIKE THIS ARE ALL TOO COMMON 
HUNDREDS OF YOU HAVE COME A CROPPER WITH COMPANIES 
WHO MAKE YOU THINK FAME AND FORTUNE IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER 
ONCE YOU HAVE PAID YOUR MONEY SOME OF THEM CAN GO STRANGELY QUIET 
AFTER GOING TO CASTING SESSION 
LISA GEORGE WAS CONTACTED BY TWO AGENCIES WANTING TO REPRESENT 
HER CHILDREN HER DAUGHTER RIA WAS THRILLED 
TO HEAR THERE MIGHT EVEN BE T. V. WORK 
I WAS HAPPY AND EXCITED ABOUT GOING ON THE T. V. 
I REALLY WANTED TO BE ON T. V. WE WERE VERY EXCITED FOR THEM 
WE KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO MAKE THEM VERY HAPPY 
AGAIN THE AGENCIES STUDIO ONE PROMOTIONS IN STOCKPORT 
AND PERFORMERS DIRECTORY LIMITED IN SOUTHWEST LONDON 
WANTED AN UP FRONT FEE 
BEFORE THE CHILDREN COULD BE PUT FORWARD FOR WORK 
SO LISA PAID THEM A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY 
THE REASON WHY WE PAID UP STRAIGHTAWAY AND SO QUICKLY 
WAS WE WANTED TO SECURE THE PLACE FOR OUR CHILDREN 
I MEAN WE WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION FROM STUDIO ONE 
AND FROM PERFORMERS DIRECTORY THAT IF WE DIDN'T GET THERE QUICK 
AND SIGN UP QUICK THAT THEY WERE GOING TO OFFER THE PLACEMENTS 
TO OTHER CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN WEREN'T GOING TO GET THE JOBS 
AFTER EIGHTEEN MONTHS THE CHILDREN HAVEN'T BEEN OFFERED ANY WORK 
AND WORSE LISA COULDN'T FIND THEIR PHOTOS ON EITHER WEBSITE 
IT TOOK A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE WE REALISED THAT WE WEREN'T ACTUALLY 
GOING GET THE SERVICE THAT WE HAD PAID FOR WE WERE VERY DOWN 
THE CHILDREN AND OURSELVES WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED 
STORIES LIKE THIS HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS 
AND FINALLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN NOTICE 
LAST MONTH THEY BROUGHT IN NEW LAWS 
MEANING AGENCIES CANNOT TAKE FEES TO PUBLICISE POTENTIAL MODELS 
UNTIL SEVEN DAYS AFTER SIGNING THEM UP 
THAT IS SUPPOSED TO GIVE THEM TIME TO THINK ABOUT 
WHAT THEY'RE PAYING FOR SOME AGENCIES HAVE IGNORED THE NEW RULES 
LIKE PLATINUM MODELS LIMITED IN LONDON 
THEY SIGNED UP THERESA MCGILL'S DAUGHTER NIKKI 
TEN DAYS AFTER THE NEW LEGISLATION CAME IN IN ORDER TO GET THE CONTRACT 
WE NEEDED TO HAVE A PORTFOLIO OF PROFESSIONAL PHOTOS 
TO TAKE ALONG TO SHOW TO T. H. E. C. LI ENTS 
THEY SAID WE CAN PROVIDE ALL THAT FOR YOU FOR THREE HUNDRED 
BY TAKING THE MONEY THE NEXT DAY PLATINUM MODELS BROKE THE LAW 
AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER COMPANIES DOING IT TOO 
WE APPLIED TO TEN MODELLING OR CASTING AGENCIES 
FOUR SIGNED US UP ALMOST IMMEDIATELY 
AND THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO KNOW OR CARE ABOUT THE NEW RULES 
BECAUSE THEY ALL TOOK OUR MONEY STRAIGHTAWAY 
CLEARLY SOME MODELLING COMPANIES ARE BLATANTLY BREAKING THE LAW 
WHICH MEANS THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S NEW LAWS JUST AREN'T WORKING 
WHY DIDN'T THEY DO MORE TO MAKE THE INDUSTRY CLEAN UP ITS ACT 
I WENT TO THE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT THAT LOOKS AFTER BUSINESS' 
I MET THE MINISTER RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING IN THE NEW REGULATIONS' 
THERE ARE SOME REAL UNSCRUPULOUS OPERATORS OUT THERE AREN'T THERE 
WELL WE THINK THAT THERE ARE AND THAT IS WHY WE'VE CHANGED THE RULES 
I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE 
WHO MAY BE PREYING ON PEOPLE'S DREAMS AND AMBITIONS 
YOU DID CHANGE THE RULES AND YOU CHANGED THE LAW BUT IT'S NOT WORKING 
SEVEN DAYS IS NOT A LONG ENOUGH COOLING OFF PERIOD 
WELL GIVEN THAT THESE NEW RULES 
ONLY CAME IN THREE OR FOUR WEEKS AGO 
I THINK IT IS TOO EARLY TO SAY HOW THEY ARE WORKING LET ME TELL YOU 
WHAT ELSE WE ARE DOING AS WELL AS THE SEVEN DAY COOLING OFF PERIOD 
THERE IS A BILL GOING THROUGH PARLIAMENT AT THE MOMENT 
WHICH WILL INCREASE THE FINES FOR AGENCIES TO BREACH THE REGULATION 
TO POTENTIALLY AN UNLIMITED FINE 
IT'S NOT JUST THE CALLING OF PERIOD 
THERE IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT NEW PENALTY POWER 
THE U. K.'S LEADING AGENCIES DON'T TAKE 
ANY UP FRONT FEES AND THEY MAKE IT CLEAR 
THE CHANCES OF SUCCESS IN SUCH COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY ARE SLIM 
BUT AS LONG AS THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DREAM OF BEING A MODEL 
THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF AGENCIES QUICK TO TAKE ADVANTAGE 
AND TAKE THEIR MONEY 
GREAT 
MOST OF THE AGENCIES THAT WE FOUND BREAKING THOSE NEW LAWS 
CLAIMED IT WAS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM 
AND THEY WILL MAKE SURE THEY PUT THAT RIGHT BUT DO WATCH OUT 
WHEN SIGNING UP WITH ANY COMPANY LIKE THIS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT 
WHAT YOU THINK YOU'RE GETTING FOR YOUR MONEY 
IS VERY DIFFERENT TO WHAT THEY ACTUALLY PROVIDE 
THAT'S THE TRUTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR E. MAILS AND LETTERS 
MOST HAVE BEEN IN RESPONSE TO OUR STORY ABOUT HOW BANKS 
CAN SUDDENLY STOP YOUR CARDS WORKING WHEN YOU'RE ABROAD 
LEAVING YOU MILES FROM HOME WITH NO CASH 
THEY DO IT WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS 
TO STOP FRAUD IT HAPPENED TO ME 
YOU TRAVEL ALL OVER THE WORLD EXACTLY 
BUT WE HAVE HAD A FEW PEOPLE BACKING THE BANKS UP ON THIS 
BUT THEY ARE VERY MUCH IN THE MINORITY 
ANDY SCOTT IS ONE OF THE MANY WHO E. MAILED ABOUT THIS 
HE WORKS FOR A MAJOR AIRLINE AND REMINDS HIS BANK OF THAT VERY MONTH 
BUT WHEREVER HE GOES THEY STILL BLOCK HIS CARD 
AND THEY SAY THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO STOP IT HAPPENING 
HENRY FOSTER WENT ON A WORLD CRUISE HE DIDN'T JUST TELL HIS BANK 
HE SENT A FULL ITINERARY WHEN HE TRIED TO PAY HIS FIRST BILL 
ON BOARD THE CARD DIDN'T WORK HE WAS REALLY LOST AT SEA AS WELL 
MIDWAY BETWEEN SINGAPORE AND BALI 
HE HAD TO USE THE RATHER EXPENSIVE SATELLITE PHONE TO SORT IT OUT 
BUT PERHAPS JULES THE WORST OF ALL 
VINCENT WILTON LIVES IN EXETER AND HIS CARD WAS BLOCKED NOT ABROAD 
BUT IN LONDON IN NOWHERE MORE EXOTIC THAN A PIZZA HUT 
WHEN HE COMPLAINED THE BANK SAID THAT IT WAS HIS FAULT 
FOR NOT TELLING THEM WHERE HE WAS GOING 
HE WISHES THEY'D BEEN AS VIGILANT WHEN A FRAUDSTER 
GOT HOLD OF HIS CARD DETAILS AND SPENT THOUSANDS WITH THEM 
OUCH PAUL HEINEY HAS UNCOVERED SOME DISASTROUS MISTAKES 
ALL DOWN TO THE GOVERNMENT 
WHO THIS TIME COULD EVEN WRECK YOUR MARRIAGE 
WHEN MOST OF US MAKE A MISTAKE 
WE LEARN FROM IT IN PARTICULAR WE LEARN NOT TO DO IT AGAIN 
BUT ONE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT HAS YET TO LEARN THAT LESSON 
IT'S TWO YEARS SINCE THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF 
DECLARED THE CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY UNFIT FOR PURPOSE 
AND ALTHOUGH IT IS FINALLY ON ITS WAY OUT IT WILL STILL BE ANOTHER 
FIVE YEARS BEFORE WE'RE RID OF IT ALTOGETHER UNTIL THEN NO DOUBT 
THE C. S. A. WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THE SAME DISASTROUS MISTAKES 
THAT IT IS FAMOUS FOR 
AND THAT IS A SHAME BECAUSE THE MAINTENANCE PAYMENTS 
FOR OVER FOURTEEN MILLION CHILDREN DEPEND ON THEM GETTING IT RIGHT 
KELLI HARRISON SPLIT UP WITH THE FATHER OF HER TWO CHILDREN 
THREE YEARS AGO AND GOT IN TOUCH WITH THE C. S. A. 
STRAIGHTAWAY THINGS WENT WRONG 
THE C. S. A. WOULD SEND ME DIFFERENT SCHEDULES THROUGH THE POST 
OF HOW OFTEN HE HAD TO PAY AND HOW MUCH 
I WAS GETTING DIFFERENT SCHEDULES SOME ONCE A WEEK SOME TWO A WEEK 
ONCE I GOT THREE IN ONE DAY ALL OF THEM WITH DIFFERENT THINGS ON THEM 
I DID NOT KNOW WHICH ONE WAS CORRECT 
AND WHEN I WAS GOING TO GET ANY MONEY 
THREE YEARS OF CONFUSION FOLLOWED 
SOME PAYMENTS WERE RECEIVED AND MANY MORE WEREN'T 
EVENTUALLY IN MARCH THIS YEAR SHE WAS TOLD EVERYTHING WAS SORTED 
BUT THEN THE C. S. A. SENT HER PAYMENT TO COMPLETELY THE WRONG PERSON 
I PHONED THE C. S. A. BECAUSE THIS MONEY WAS NOT IN MY ACCOUNT 
AND I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS PUT IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S ACCOUNT 
I HAVE NOT RECEIVED AN EXPLANATION FOR HOW IT'S HAPPENED 
IT HAS BEEN A COMPLETE JOKE FROM START TO FINISH NOW 
AND IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR OVER THREE YEARS 
AND THE REASON FOR THOUSANDS OF BLUNDERS LIKE THESE 
A COMPUTER SYSTEM 
ONE THAT COST FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION 
AND IT HAS NEVER QUITE WORKED PROPERLY 
BROUGHT IN FIVE YEARS AGO 
THE COMPUTER WAS SUPPOSED TO SORT EVERYTHING OUT INSTEAD 
IT HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY BLAMED FOR MAKING THINGS WORSE 
AND IT HAS CERTAINLY DONE THAT FOR NINA HOPSON 
IN JANUARY SHE DID NOT GET 
HER NORMAL PAYMENT FROM THE C. S. A. 
AS USUAL HER EX PAID THEM FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY SIX POINT NINE OH 
BUT NINA ONLY RECEIVED THE NINETY P. 
YOU MIGHT THINK THE C. S. A. COULD JUST 
ADD THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE TO HER NEXT PAYMENT 
BUT WHEN SHE CALLED THE C. S. A. 
THE PERSON ON THE PHONE SAID THEY COULD NOT OVERRIDE THE COMPUTER 
IT HAD BEEN SENT ON TO DRIP FEED 
SHE EXPLAINED THAT DRIP FEED 
MEANS THAT I WILL JUST GET PAYMENTS AT RANDOM 
SO WHILE I WAS ENTITLED TO FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY SIX POINT NINE OH I GOT NINETY P. 
THEN AT RANDOM OVER THE NEXT HOWEVER MANY YEARS 
I WOULD GET ONE POINT TWO OH HERE THIRTY P. THERE BUT NOT EVERY MONTH 
IT WILL BE MONTHS AT RANDOM I'LL GET MY PAYMENT IN FULL BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY EIGHT 
IT IS ONE SIMPLE MISTAKE 
THAT IS GOING TO TAKE THE C. S. A. TWENTY YEARS TO PUT RIGHT 
I REALLY CAN'T SEE HOW THEY CAN JUST SAY WHOOPS SORRY 
I CAN'T IMAGINE THERE'S ANY OTHER AGENCY THAT WOULD SAY YES WE HAVE 
YOUR MONEY WE CAN SEE IT THERE BUT SORRY WE CAN'T GIVE IT TO YOU 
THEY HAVE PROVED THEY ARE NOT EXACTLY GRADE A STUDENTS 
WHEN IT COMES TO MATHS BUT THERE IS ANOTHER SUBJECT 
AT WHICH THE C. S. A. CAN FAIL BADLY 
BIOLOGY 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE ACCUSED SOME MEN OF FATHERING CHILDREN 
WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM 
NOW THAT IS A COCK UP 
AND ONE THAT ALMOST DESTROYED THIS FAMILY ANDREW AND HIS WIFE 
LISA HAVE BEEN TOGETHER EIGHTEEN YEARS 
THEY LIVE HAPPILY 
WITH FOUR CHILDREN FIVE DOGS AND FIVE CATS 
BUT ONE DAY LISA OPENED LETTER MEANT FOR ANDREW FROM THE C. S. A. 
IT SAID HE'D HAD A SON WITH SOMEONE ELSE 
WE HAD BEEN TOGETHER EIGHTEEN YEARS THAT MEANS HE MUST HAVE CHEATED 
MY WORLD JUST FELL APART 
THE PHONE RANG MY WIFE WAS ON THE END 
AND SHE STARTED SHOUTING DOWN THE PHONE 
I'M LIKE WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 
I CAN'T HAVE ANOTHER KID WITH SOMEONE 
SHE WAS LIKE THE LETTER'S HERE IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME 
I WAS THINKING WHAT AM I GOING TO TELL THE KIDS 
THE LETTER HAD COME AND I HONESTLY BELIEVED IT 
BUT THERE WAS A VERY GOOD REASON WHY IT COULDN'T BE TRUE 
ANDREW HAD A VASECTOMY EIGHT YEARS EARLIER 
THE C. S. A. ADMITTED ITS MISTAKE IT HAD BEEN CAUSED BY AN ERROR 
WITH A NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBER 
BUT THE DAMAGE TO THEIR RELATIONSHIP HASN'T BEEN SO EASY TO FIX 
THERE WAS A LOT OF TRUST ISSUES AFTER THAT FOR A WHILE 
BUT WE ARE SLOWLY GETTING OVER THAT NOW I AM NOT TRUSTING HIM AGAIN 
BUT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LIKE THAT 
HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PUT IN THAT POSITION REALLY IT WAS WRONG 
THE C. S. A. IS VERY POWERFUL 
EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE GOT IT WRONG THEY CAN STILL TAKE MONEY 
DIRECTLY FROM YOUR PAY CHEQUE 
OR IN THIS CASE EVEN FROM YOUR PENSION 
THAT HAPPENED TO MICK WILLIAMS 
IT ALMOST DESTROYED HIS MARRIAGE TO JUDITH 
THREE YEARS AGO THE C. S. A. WROTE HIM A LETTER 
ACCUSING HIM OF FATHERING A CHILD HE HADN'T 
I SHOWED IT TO JUDITH AND I WERE SHAKING I WAS NEARLY IN TEARS 
BECAUSE I THOUGHT 
HANG ON THIS COULD BE MY MARRIAGE AT AN END 
MICK HAD HAD A VASECTOMY AND THE C. S. A. APOLOGISED FOR THEIR MISTAKE 
THE WILLIAMS PUT IT BEHIND THEM UNTIL LAST CHRISTMAS WHEN THE C. S. A. 
WROTE TO HIM AGAIN ACCUSING HIM OF EXACTLY THE SAME THING 
THERE WAS A LETTER SAYING YOU ARE THE FATHER OF THIS CHILD 
THAT'S SITTING ON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF JUDITH 
SHE IS LOOKING AT THAT AND AT ME 
AND YOU COULD SEE THE DOUBT IN HER EYES AND I AM THINKING 
THIS IS A STRUGGLE I HAVE REALLY GOT TO FIGHT HERE 
TO KEEP OUR MARRIAGE TOGETHER 
THIS TIME THE C. S. A. WEREN'T WAITING FOR PROOF 
THEY WERE ALREADY TAKING MAINTENANCE PAYMENTS STRAIGHT FROM HIS PENSION 
THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE GOT THAT MUCH POWER AND ARE FREE TO USE IT 
AS THEY PLEASE IS A VERY VERY BAD THING 
IT IS IT'S A VERY BAD THING 
THERE SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF CONTROL OVER THEM 
THE C. S. A. APOLOGISED AGAIN AND HAVE GIVEN COMPENSATION 
BUT MICK AND JUDITH ARE FURIOUS THIS COULD HAPPEN 
ONCE YES BUT TWICE 
UNBELIEVABLE ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE 
MY MARRIAGE MEANS A LOT TO ME WE HAVE BEEN VERY VERY HAPPY 
VERY HAPPY AND I WOULD HATE ANYTHING TO COME BETWEEN US 
I REALLY WOULD 
THIS WAS JUST A HORRIBLE HORRIBLE THING TO HAPPEN 
THERE IS ONE THING THE C. S. A. IS RATHER GOOD AT SPENDING MONEY 
BECAUSE IT COSTS THE TAXPAYER 
OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION EVERY YEAR 
WHAT A SHAME VERY FEW PEOPLE WOULD SAY 
THAT IS MONEY WELL SPENT 
THE CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY SAY THEY ARE SORRY FOR ERRORS THAT OCCUR 
BUT THEY CAN'T COMMENT ON INDIVIDUAL CASES THEY SAY THAT THIS YEAR 
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN WILL BENEFIT FROM MORE THAN ONE BILLION WORTH 
OF BENEFITS ARRANGED BY THE C. S. A. THEIR BEST EVER PERFORMANCE 
THEY ALSO THAT THEY ARE DELIVERING 
REAL IMPROVEMENTS TO CUSTOMER SERVICE COMPLIANCE AND COLLECTIONS 
THEY STRESSED HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR SEPARATED PARENTS 
TO TAKE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR CHILDREN WHICH IS FINE 
PROVIDED OF COURSE THAT YOU ARE TAKING MONEY FROM THE RIGHT PERSON 
IF YOU HAVE GOT A STORY FOR US TO INVESTIGATE 
HERE IS HOW TO TELL US LOG ON TO OUR WEBSITE 
OR CALL US ON 
OR YOU CAN WRITE TO US AT 
IT COULD BE YOUR STORY ON THE SHOW NEXT WEEK OUR LAST WEEK 
A GOOD FEW TEXTS TONIGHT AND INEVITABLY LOTS ON THE C. S. A.

AND NO RESPONSE 
WELL WE'LL BE BACK AT THE SAME TIME NEXT MONDAY FOR OUR LAST PROGRAMME 
UNTIL THE AUTUMN WE'LL CATCH UP WITH SOME OF OUR BIGGEST STORIES 
FROM ALL OF THE TEAM THANKS FOR WATCHING 
GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT 
LIKE THE ONE YOU HAD TODAY YOU'D MOST PROBABLY BE RE ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL 
LIKE THE ONE YOU HAD TODAY YOU'D MOST PROBABLY BE RE ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL
