COMPANIES FOR PEOPLE WHO DO WHAT I 
DO I KNOW MY LIMITATIONS AND MY 
LEVEL IS SOMEBODY'S NUMBER TWO 
PREFERRABLY RAEF'S BECAUSE HE'S 
GREAT 
WHAT DO WE THINK OF THEIR GREAT RELUCTANCE TO HAVE HIM AS MANAGER 
TREVOR 
WELL I WAS A BIT TREVOR DISAPPOINTED WITH THE ATTITUDE TO 
YOU I THOUGHT YOU WERE A GRAFTER 
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE IN THE WHOLE 
SHOW THAT'S BEEN GRAFTING THAT HARD 
IN FAIRNESS I DID FIND YOU A 
LITTLE NAIVE JUST A LITTLE BIT TO 
ALL THE BITCHING GOING ON AROUND 
YOU YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN YOU WERE 
THE ONE WITHOUT AN AGENDA YOU GOT 
ON WITH THE TASK MAYBE THEY 
THOUGHT YOU WERE RUDDERLESS 
PERHAPS 
COMING ONTO THIS SHOW PERHAPS WITHOUT AN AGENDA IS SERIOUS YOU 
SHOULD HAVE HAD ONE 
WHEN YOU SAID 
AT THE BEGINNING I'M PREPARED TO DO 
T. H. I'LL PUT MY NUTS ON THE BLOCK 
DIDN'T THEY IMMEDIATELY START TO 
ACHE BECAUSE ALL AROUND YOU WERE 
THESE PEOPLE DID UP SENSE THEY 
WERE EFFECTIVELY GOING TO GANG UP 
ON YOU WHICH THEY DID REALLY THE THE FIRST TIME I DID THAT IS WHEN I 
OFFERED ALEX THE NUMBER TWO SPOT 
YOU COULD SEE THE COGS IN MY HEAD 
HIS HEAD HE WAS THINKING IF HE 
GIVES ME THIS IT COULD GET ME 
FIRED 
THEN HE WENT TO CLAIRE FIRED CLAIRE'S A GREAT PERSON SHE'S A 
GOOD MANAGER WAS CONSCIOUS OF 
THE FACT I NEEDED THOSE PEOPLE I 
NEEDED TWO EGOS AWAY FROM ME 
PUSHED THEM INTO THE SECOND TEAM 
IT IT'S DIFFICULT SAID AT THE 
START THRU THE AUDITION PROCESS 
IF YOU'RE EXPECTING ME TO GO IN 
WITH GAME PLAN IF I HAD TO STAB 
PEOPLE IN THE BACK AND DO THAT TO 
WIN T. H. I DON'T WANT TO WIN IT 
TERRY BEFORE WE LOOK AT WHERE IT 
WENT WRONG WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF 
SIMON 
I THINK YOU GOT THE SHORT SIMON END OF THE WEDGE THERE YOU'RE A 
GREAT BLOKE YOU'D BE ON MY TEAM 
ANY TIME 
THANK YOU 
YOU DID THE 
PHOTOGRAPHY SIDE EXCELLENTLY 
MEAN WHEN YOU FIRST CAME ON YOU 
WERE SAYING I KNOW ABOUT IT AND 
THAT I THOUGHT THIS IS GOING TO BE 
A LAUGH BUT YOU DID IT BRILLIANTLY 
WHEN YOU SAID TO SIR ALAN ABOUT YOU 
MADE PEOPLE LAUGH AND CREATED THAT 
ATMOSPHERE THAT IS WHAT 
PHOTOGRAPHY IS ABOUT NOBODY 
UNDERSTANDS THAT BUT YOU DID IT'S 
A GREAT GREAT SHAME 
THE ONLY THING I THINK YOU DID 
WRONG WAS YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE 
WAY IT WAS GOING AND HANDED IT OVER 
TO CLAIRE AND JUST CONCENTRATED ON 
THE PHOTOGRAPHY BECAUSE THAT LOT 
DIDN'T KNOW A THING FROM BEANS 
HAVE A LOCK AT THIS AND REMIND US 
WHERE IT DID ALL GO WRONG IT 
STARTED BADDELEY AND KIND 
OF KIND KIND OF IN THE CAFE ON THE FIRST DAY 
AND IT WAS DOWN HILL FROM THERE 
THIS IS A JOKE YOU GOT PEOPLE 
MILLING AROUND READY TO SPEND 
THEIR MONEY AND YOU DIDN'T TAKE 
THEIR MONEY 
THREE POINT NINE NINE FOR A KEY RING 
ONE DAY TAKING REALLY FANTASTIC 
SHOTS 
THAT LADY WANTS TO HAVE HER SHOTS FRIEND DONE 
IT'S ALMOST INSULTING

FUCKING NERVES

DEPRESSED 
ALL RIGHT 
YOU'VE BEEN IN THEATRES OF WAR AND 
YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T GET AS UPSET AS 
THAT IT GETS UNDER YOUR SKIN THE THE THING IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE 
THE BIT THAT PEOPLE DON'T 
APPRECIATE IS THE BUSINESS SIDE IS 
VERY REAL YOU ARE DEALING WITH 
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IF WE HAD 
PRODUCED THE GOODS THAT WE HAD 
TAKEN THE PHOTOS FOR WE WOULD HAVE 
WON IT WAS ME AT THE FRONT LINE OF 
THAT DEALING WITH PEOPLE THAT HAD 
GOT THEY'D SEEN A PROOF OF THEIR

OF THE GREAT PHOTOGRAPHERS WE CAN 
SEE SOME OF HIS WORK NOW THE 
BEATLES FIRST ONE OF THE FIRST 
PHOTOGRAPHERS TO TAKE THEIR PICTURE 
ELVIS PRESLEY WHERE WAS THAT 
TAKEN VEGAS 
YOU'RE IN EXULTED TAKEN VEGAS COMPANY IF WE SEE YOUR PHOTOGRAPH 
WITH THAT PURPLE DRAPE 
YOU HAD TO 
GET THAT ONE DIDN'T YOU 
RAQUEL WELCH THAT WAS HIS WORK 
WASN'T BAD 
NO YOU DID A GOOD JOB L. KNOW HOW 
DIFFICULT IT IS YOU DID A BLOODY 
GOOD JOB 
LET'S EXAMINE HELENE 
FIRST OF ALL WHAT WAS SHE DOING 
PUTTING LUCINDA IN THAT JOB WHEN 
SHE SAID SHE COULDN'T DO AND THEN 
SHE JUST LIED ABOUT IT 
I CAN'T EVEN 
USE A MOBILE PHONE L. HAVE NEVER 
HAD A DIGITAL CAMERA L. DON'T KNOW 
HOW TO USE A CAMERA ON MY PHONE 
FROM THE MINUTE THEY PUT YOU IN 
CHARGE OF PRODUCTION WHY DIDN'T 
YOU SAY I CAN'T DO THIS GUYS I I DID 
YOU DID NOT YOU HAVE STRONG DID VIEWS ON THIS TREVOR 
SHE IS NOT 
VERY GOOD AT ANYTHING LUCINDA 
SHE'S NOT L. AM AMAZED SHE SURVIVED 
LONGER THAN YOU SIMON L. HAVE TO 
BE HONEST WITH YOU SHE'S GOING TO 
WORK WITH WITH SIR ALAN WHO SOLD 
MILLIONS OF THE THINGS AND SHE'S NO 
GOOD TECHNOLOGICALLY SHE'S STILL 
THERE 
YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE GIRL THERE CREDIT SHE'S BEEN ON THE WINNING 
TEAM TWICE 
HELENE AND LUCINDA 
THEY REALLY REALLY DON'T LIKE EACH 
OTHER DO THEY 
SHE'S BEEN 
INCOMPETENCE SHE'S LAZY AND SHE 
DOESN'T WANT TO PULL HER WEIGHT 
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS WHAT WHAT REALLY PISSES ME OFF IN BUSINESS IS 
INCOMPETENCE 
I AM DOING MY BEST IT INCOMPETENCE IT IS ABOUT BEING ASSIGNED A ROLE AND 
GETTING ON WITH IT 
IT IS ABOUT 
PUTTING PEOPLE IN THE APPROPRIATE 
SKILL SET 
OH FOR CHRIST'S SAKE 
CAN YOU SAVE ALL THESE TO C. D. 
DO 
DO NOT SPEAK TO ME LIKE THAT HOW DARE 
YOU HOW DARE YOU 
I LOVE RAEF'S REACTION TO THAT 
IT'S LIKE I'M GOING TO GO FOR A 
WALK NOW 
HE KNOWS WHEN TO NOT 
INTERVENE WHAT DOES HELENE DO FOR YOU 
NOTHING SHE'S QUITE A BULLY YOU SHE IS PLAYING THE GAME AND WITH 
LUCINDA SHE PUT A WEAK PERSON IN A 
WEAK PLACE TO WATCH HER BREAK AND I 
AM NOT SURE 
IT COULD HAVE LOST 
HER THE TASK 
IT WAS BUT THAT IS 
THE DANGEROUS GAME SHE'S PLAYING 
SHE'S JUST GOT ONE OF THOSE REALLY 
REALLY GRATING VOICES AND ATTITUDES 
WHERE YOU JUST EVEN IF SHE SAID 
HELLO I LOVE YOU YOU WOULD FIND 
YOURSELF GOING STOP STOP MY MY EXPERIENCE WITH HELE HELENE SHE 
WAS THE ONE OF THE GIRLS THAT I 
FOUND TO BE STRAIGHT DOWN THE LINE 
YOU SAW HER COME TO ZARA'S DEFENCE 
IN THE KITCHEN 
I THINK ALL THE 
GIRLS ARE A WASTE OF SPACE 
NORMALLY I LIKE ALL THE GUYS IN 
THIS NORMALLY YOU WOULD LOVE THE 
GIRLS THAT IS WHERE THE DRAMAS ARE 
BUT HERE THEY ARE JUST SLAGGING 
EACH OTHER OFF IT'S TERRIBLE 
LET'S SEE WHAT SIR ALAN AND SOME OF 
YOUR COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS HAVE TO 
SAY ABOUT YOU 
BRACE YOURSELF 
HIS BIGGEST CRIME WAS HE HAD A 
BUNCH OF CUSTOMERS THERE AND HE 
COULDN'T DELIVER AND HE HAD TO LET 
THEM GO UNBELIEVABLE THAT TO ME 
IS THE BIGGEST CRIME EVER THE 
REASON FOR THAT IS THAT HE GOT 
HIMSELF CARRIED AWAY THINKING HE 
WAS A PHOTOGRAPHER THINKING HE WAS 
A LEADER HE'S NO LEADER TRUST ME 
I WOULDN'T GO TO HIM AS A LEADER 
AND ASK FOR SUPPORT IT WAS VICE 
VERSA HE HAD VERY GOOD PEOPLE 
WORKING FOR HIM HE IS LIKE A 
MISSILE THAT IS ABOUT TO FLY OUT 
INTO OUTER SPACE AND BURST AT ANY 
MOMENT 
HE WAS QUITE JUMPY AND MOMENT ERRATIC AND MAKING QUICK DECISIONS 
AND THEN HE WOULD TALK TO CLAIRE 
AND CHANGE HIS MIND ANYTHING ANYTHING PHYSICAL YOU WANT DONE SIMON WOULD 
DO IT RUN A BUSINESS HE CAN'T 
THIS TASK HE COMPLETELY GOT IT 
WRONG AND THAT IS WHY I FIRED SIMON 
THAT'S A FAIR ONE REALLY SERIOUSLY 
YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE OF YOUR OWN 
LIMITATIONS TO BE IN BUSINESS YOU 
NEED INTEGRITY THERE'S NOTHING 
THAT ANYBODY SAID THERE THAT ISN'T 
TRUE 
YOU BEAT TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE TO GET TRUE THIS FAR 
YEAH L. DID 
SO YOU ARE A 
WINNER 
I HAVE WON AT STUFF O. K. WINNER THE REASON HE IS DOWN ON HIMSELF IS 
BECAUSE HE IS WEST HAM UNITED FAN 
LET'S LOOK AT JENNY AS EVER JENNY 
WAS ON THE BALL HERE HERE YOU 
NOTICE SHE CLOCKS SIR ALAN MIGHT BE 
TURNING HIS FIRING FINGER ON CLAIRE 
LOOK OUT FOR THE LOOK ON JENNY'S 
FACE THIS IS A CROSS BETWEEN LADY 
MACBETH AND THE SERPENT IN THE 
JUNGLE BOOK WHEN SHE CLOCKS WHAT'S 
HAPPENING 
I WAS ORGANISING THE HAPPENING ORDERS COMING THROUGH AND THE 
BACKLOG WE HAD 
WHY DIDN'T YOU 
RELAY TO THEM THAT THERE WAS 
AGGRAVATION ON THE SHOP FLOOR THEY THEY KNEW THERE WAS AGGRAVATION ON THE 
SHOP FLOOR 
WE WERE WEREN'T 
PROVIDED WITH THE FULL PICTURE YOU YOU DIDN'T GET A SENSE OF THERE'S 
SOMETHING GOING WRONG DEFINITELY DEFINITELY LOT 
ALEX JOINED IN THE CLAIRE HUNT LOT THAT IS THE NAIL ON THE HEAD THE 
WAY I SEE IT WHAT WHAT MISCOMMUNICATED THE MOST INITIALLY INITIALLY I THOUGHT IT WAS DOWN TO THE 
PROJECT MANAGER BUT NOW I AM 
HEARING IT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE 
RUNNING THE INFORMATION BETWEEN US 
AND THE FRONT END 
SO YOU ARE 
SAYING CLAIRE WE WILL GET ON TO 
ALEX IN A SECOND WHAT DID YOU MAKE 
OF JENNY THERE 
IT'S ALL THEY ARE 
ALL UP TO SKULDUGGERY THIS IS THE 
FIRST PROGRAMME WHERE IT'S BEEN 
REALLY APPARENT TO ME 
I THINK 
THAT'S THE REASON WHY JENNY WEARS 
THAT SCARF AROUND HER HER NECK THE 
WHOLE TIME SHE'S NOT ACTUALLY 
HUMAN SHE'S BEEN BUILT FROM OTHER 
PARTS OF APPRENTICE WINNERS 
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY LADY MACBETH 
ABOUT HER 
THAT LOOK IN HER EYE IT 
CHILLS ME TO THE BONE PRESUMABLY I 
AM GOING TO HAVE HER SITTING NEXT 
TO ME 
I LOVE THIS SKULDUGGERY AND 
YOU LOVE IT TOO IT'S BRILLIANT AT AT THAT MOMENT IT DID LIKE LIKE 
CLAIRE WAS GOING TO GET IT BUT IT 
TURNED OUT IT WAS CLAIRE WHO TURNED 
OUT TO BE COATED TO TEFLON 
LET ME 
TELL YOU FROM WHAT I CAN SEE SO FAR 
YOU AIN'T THAT BLOODY GREAT 
YOURSELF I HAVEN'T WORKED OUT WHAT 
THE HELL YOU WERE DOING YESTERDAY

BLOODY HOUSE O. K. GET BACK TO THE

NOT A LOT TERRY WHAT DO YOU MAKE 
OF HER 
I THOUGHT ACTUALLY THE 
FIRST TIME HE'S REALLY LOST HIS RAG 
AND HE'S GOT RID OF HER 
SO DID I 
I THOUGHT I HAVE HAD A RESULT HERE 
WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE WITH SIR 
ALAN HE LIKES SOMETHING ABOUT HER 
IT IS CLEARLY OBVIOUS OR HE WOULD 
HAVE GOT RID OF HER HE WANTS HER 
TO PROVE IT HE LIKED SOMETHING 
ABOUT YOU LAST WEEK EVEN THOUGH HE 
SAID YOU HAVEN'T STEPPED UP TO THE 
PLATE HE GAVE YOU THE CHANCE WITH 
HER HE IS DOING THE SAME THING HE 
IS TESTING THE WATER THINK YOU 
HAVE TO WATCH HER I THINK SHE MAY 
SURVIVE 
SHE'S GOT AN IMAGE PROBLEM SURVIVE SHE LOOKS IN THE MIRROR AND SEES A 
REALLY FEISTY TALENTED WONDERFUL 
APPRENTICE IN THE OFFING AND IN THE 
REALITY SHE IS A STROPPYDOLLOP
