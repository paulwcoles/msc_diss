CHINA 
A ONE PARTY COMMUNIST STATE UNDERGOING RAPID CHANGE 
HOME TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION SCHOOLCHILDREN AND THE SMALL TOWN OF XIUNING 
THIS IS THE STORY OF THREE SCHOOLS HERE 
AND LIFE OVER THE YEAR OF THE GOLDEN PIG 
CHINA'S FIRST EVER OLYMPIC GAMES ARE ON THE NEAR HORIZON 
IT MAY BE ONE THOUSAND MILES FROM BEIJING 
BUT THAT HASN'T STOPPED OLYMPIC FEVER REACHING XIUNING COUNTY 
AUTUMN IS THE TIME OF YEAR WHEN THE FOCUS OF SCHOOL LIFE MAKES A RARE SHIFT AWAY FROM THE CLASSROOM 
IT'S A TIME WHEN ATHLETES LIKE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD XU LEI COME INTO THEIR OWN 
AT PING MIN PRIMARY IT'S THEIR FIRST SPORTS DAY EVER 
LITTLE DAI DELI IS DETERMINED TO WIN EVERY EVENT 
THE TEACHERS OF XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL 
ARE JOINED ON THEIR ANNUAL FISHING TRIP BY COMMUNIST PARTY SECRETARY JIN 
AND SHE PROVES SHE HAS TALENTS BEYOND POLITICS 
IT'S OCTOBER AND THE HARVEST HAS BEGUN IN THE RURAL PROVINCE OF ANHUI 
AT HAIYANG MIDDLE SCHOOL IT'S LUNCH BREAK 
TIME FOR THE DAILY STUDENT BROADCAST 
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD ZHA YUJIE HAS BEEN BROADCASTING WITH HER FRIEND NING SHEJIAN FOR SIX MONTHS 
SHE'S IN HER FINAL YEAR AND THE FORTHCOMING SPORTS DAY WILL BE A WELCOME RELIEF FROM HER STUDIES 
AT SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT CHINA 
SPORTS DAYS REALLY ARE LIKE A SMALL OLYMPIC GAMES 
NO EVENT IS COMPLETE WITHOUT LOCAL DIGNITARIES AND AN ELABORATE OPENING CEREMONY 
AT HAIYANG THAT WILL INCLUDE MARCHING DISPLAY TEAMS DRUMS 
AND A SPECIAL KUNG FU ROUTINE 
ARRANGING THE SCHOOL SPORTS IS A MAMMOTH UNDERTAKING FOR DEPUTY HEADMASTER MR. YE 
MR. YE HAS TAUGHT AT HAIYANG FOR TWENTY YEARS BUT ONLY BECAME DEPUTY HEAD SEVEN MONTHS AGO 
ROUND THE CORNER THE GIRLS ARE GETTING TO GRIPS WITH THEIR FLAGS 
UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE SCHOOL'S DANCE AND DRAMA TEACHER MS. LI 
HERE IN THE MOUNTAINOUS REGION OF ANHUI 
AUTUMN IS A TIME OF HEAVY MORNING MISTS 
FOR THE YOUNG PUPILS OF PING MIN PRIMARY 
THEIR BOARDING SCHOOL IS A HOME AWAY FROM HOME 
THE SCHOOL LIES THREE MILES WEST OF XIUNING TOWN 
ALL THE STUDENTS LIVE AT THE SCHOOL FOR THIRTY NINE WEEKS OF THE YEAR 
AND SELDOM LEAVE THE PREMISES BUT TODAY IS SPECIAL 
IT'S THE ANNUAL AUTUMN OUTING 
MOST OF THE CHILDREN ARE FROM VERY RURAL AREAS 
AND MANY HAVE NEVER BEEN INTO XIUNING TOWN BEFORE 
NEVER ONE TO MISS AN EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY 
HEAD TEACHER MRS. ZHANG HAS TAKEN A SHORT DETOUR INTO TOWN 
THINGS ARE NOT QUITE AS THEY SHOULD BE AT THE RIVERSIDE PICNIC SITE 
IT MAY LOOK LIKE LITTER 
BUT TO THE TEACHERS OF PING MIN IT'S A LESSON TO BE LEARNED 
PING MIN IS RUN BY A CHARITABLE FOUNDATION 
AND IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM STATE RUN SCHOOLS 
RESPECT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IS AT THE CENTRE OF THE SCHOOL'S ETHOS 
AND THIS TRIP IS JUST PART OF THE CHILDREN'S BROADER EDUCATION 
WITH THE SITE CLEANED UP AND FIREWOOD GATHERED 
IT'S TIME FOR CHENG CHAO TO TAKE ON THE ROLE OF CHIEF COOK AND FIRE STOKER 
IT'S FIVE THIRTY A M. AND COMMUNIST PARTY SECRETARY JIN IS ON HER WAY TO WORK AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL 
A TWENTY MINUTE JOURNEY SHE CYCLES EVERY DAY 
EVERY SECONDARY SCHOOL IN CHINA HAS A COMMUNIST PARTY REPRESENTATIVE ON THEIR STAFF 
THE OFFICIAL JOB DESCRIPTION IS TO OVERSEE THE MORAL AND POLITICAL SIDE OF SCHOOL LIFE 
EVERY DAY SECRETARY JIN JOINS THE STUDENTS IN THEIR MORNING RITUAL 
FEEDING MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS REQUIRES ORDER 
SUPERVISING BREAKFAST IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY DISCIPLINARY DUTIES FULFILLED BY SECRETARY JIN 
ALMOST ALL OF THE TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL ARE BOARDERS 
AROUND THREE HUNDRED OF THOSE ARE THE CHILDREN OF MIGRANT WORKERS 
THEY'RE KNOWN AS LEFT BEHIND CHILDREN 
IN COMMON WITH MILLIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY 
THEIR PARENTS HAVE LEFT THE AREA TO WORK IN CITIES 
TODAY CHINESE TEACHER MS. WANG HAS COME TO SEE SECRETARY JIN 
TO DISCUSS SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR THESE STUDENTS WHO RARELY LEAVE SCHOOL 
TO FIND OUT HOW THE STUDENTS ARE COPING 
THEY'VE BEEN ASKED TO WRITE ABOUT THEIR PARENTS' ABSENCE 
AFTER A QUICK BREAK SECRETARY JIN HEADS TO HER MOST IMPORTANT ENGAGEMENT 
THE FIRST MEETING OF THE SCHOOL'S BUDDING YOUNG PARTY MEMBERS 
BEGINNING WITH A VISIT TO THE SCHOOL'S MUSEUM 
MOST OF THE STUDENTS OF XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL ARE IN THE COMMUNIST YOUTH LEAGUE 
BUT ONLY A SELECT FEW WILL BECOME FULL PARTY MEMBERS ON LEAVING SCHOOL 
THESE STUDENTS ARE THE CREAM OF THE CROP 
THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA HAS SEVENTY THREE MILLION MEMBERS 
IT MAY SOUND LIKE A LOT BUT IN FACT IS ONLY FIVE PER CENT OF THE THIRTEEN BILLION PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY 
THE CHILDREN OF PING MIN PRIMARY ARE ALL FROM POOR RURAL FAMILIES 
AND ARE SPECIALLY SELECTED FOR ENTRY BY THE TEACHERS BASED ON NEED 
SIX YEAR OLD YU JIEYUAN'S PARENTS DIVORCED WHEN SHE WAS A BABY 
SINCE THEY BOTH WORKED AWAY AS MIGRANT WORKERS 
HER GRANDFATHER LAO YU BECAME HER GUARDIAN 
WHEN HIS GRANDDAUGHTER WAS OFFERED A PLACE AT PING MIN 
LAO YU LEAPT AT THE CHANCE 
LAO YU IS A TALENTED CALLIGRAPHER AND ALTHOUGH HE LIVES EIGHTEEN MILES AWAY 
HE COMES TO PING MIN REGULARLY TO MAKE SIGNS AND BANNERS FOR THE SCHOOL 
HE HOPES THAT HIS GRANDDAUGHTER WILL CARRY ON THE FAMILY TRADITION 
WITH SCHOOL SPORTS DAY LOOMING HIS BANNER MAKING SKILLS ARE BEING PUT TO GOOD USE 
NEXT WEEK'S SPORTS DAY IS THE FIRST THE SCHOOL HAS EVER HELD 
TODAY'S P. E. CLASS IS DEVOTED TO TEACHING THE BASICS TO THESE INEXPERIENCED ATHLETES 
EIGHT YEAR OLD DAI DELI HAS HIGH HOPES OF WINNING GOLD AT HIS FIRST EVER SPORTS DAY 
IT'S SATURDAY AND HAIYANG SCHOOL'S RADIO PRESENTER ZHA YUJIE 
IS OUT SHOPPING WITH HER FRIEND 
ZHA YUJIE HAS BEEN SAVING UP FOR A VERY SPECIAL PURCHASE FOR MONTHS 
IT'S THE THIRD OF NOVEMBER 
AND THE CHINESE TRANSLATION OF THE LAST HARRY POTTER BOOK HAS JUST HIT THE SHOPS 
J. K. ROWLING IS MY FAVOURITE WRITER 
THE STORY ABOUT ER THE AGE JUST

THIS IS HARRY POTTER THE SEVENTH AND LAST HARRY POTTER 
THE BOOK IS ON SALE FOR FORTY THREE YUAN ABOUT THREE 
BUT ZHA YUJIE IS NOT ABOUT TO PART WITH ANY MORE CASH THAN SHE HAS TO 
AFTER A SUCCESSFUL DAY'S BARGAINING 
SHE HEADS HOME TO SHOW HER DAD HER NEWEST PRIZED POSSESSIONS 
HE'S GIVEN UP HIS JOB AS A PAINTER AND DECORATOR TO SUPPORT HER IN HER CRUCIAL FINAL YEAR 
THIS IS MY BEDROOM COME IN

BECKHAM HE HAS A WIFE 
VERY SEXY AND BEAUTIFUL 
AND ZIDANE O. K. 
AT A LAKESIDE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN 
THE TEACHERS OF XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL ARE ENJOYING SOME RARE TIME OFF TOGETHER 
I COME HERE TO ENJOY THE SMELL OF THE FLOWERS 
TO ENJOY THE FRESH AIR THE SUNSHINE 
MANY PEOPLE BEING TOGETHER TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND YOU KNOW 
WE HAVE BEEN VERY BUSY DURING THE WEEK SO WE NEED THIS TIME THIS CHANCE TO 
OOH OOH 
TO RELAX 
ALTHOUGH IT'S REALLY JUST A SOCIAL EVENT 
THERE'S A LITTLE MORE TO THE FISHING TRIP THAN MEETS THE EYE 
SOME TAKE IT MORE SERIOUSLY 
BUT I DON'T THINK I CAN BEAT ANYONE NOT MR. CHEN NOT MR. WONG 
MANY GOOD FISHERS I MEAN FISHERMEN 
THEY'RE GOOD THEY'RE REALLY GOOD 
JUST AS THE MALE TEACHERS THINK THEY'VE GOT IT ALL SEWN UP 
LAST YEAR'S CHAMPION SECRETARY JIN HAS ARRIVED ON THE SCENE 
THE MALE TEACHERS AREN'T ABOUT TO GIVE IN LIGHTLY 
AND CHINESE LANGUAGE TEACHER MR. HU 
HAS A SECRET WEAPON IN HIS ARMOURY 
A SPECIAL BAIT TRICK 
THIS ONE IS THE BIGGEST I'VE CAUGHT 
IT BROUGHT GOOD LUCK 
SECRETARY JIN IS THE ONLY FEMALE AT SENIOR LEVEL IN THE SCHOOL'S HIERARCHY 
SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNTHINKABLE WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER 
ALTHOUGH SECRETARY JIN'S DONE WELL ENOUGH TO KEEP HER REPUTATION INTACT 
THIS YEAR'S CLEAR WINNER WITH THE BIGGEST HAUL 
IS OLD HAND SPORTS TEACHER MR. WANG 
BACK AT HAIYANG 
THERE ARE ONLY A FEW DAYS UNTIL THE OPENING CEREMONY OF THE SPORTS MEETING 
AMONGST THE GIRLS THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THEIR COSTUMES 
IS CAUSING A MIXED REACTION 
THERE MAY BE ONLY A FEW DAYS OF REHEARSAL LEFT 
BUT FOR THE KUNG FU BOYS THE FUTURE IS STILL IN THE BALANCE 
OUT ON THE SPORTS FIELD 
THE SENIOR STUDENTS ARE FOCUSING ON THE COMPETITIVE SIDE OF THE SPORTS MEETING 
SPRINTER XU LEI SEES THE EVENT AS HIS CHANCE TO PROVE THAT HE'S THE FASTEST RUNNER IN SCHOOL 
ALTHOUGH HE'S CONFIDENT THIS IS XU LEI'S FIRST SPORTS MEETING 
IF HE'S TO COME OUT ON TOP 
HE'LL HAVE TO BEAT THE REIGNING CHAMP XIE ZICAN 
XU LEI TURNED EIGHTEEN IN JUNE AND WILL LEAVE SCHOOL NEXT YEAR 
THE SPORTS MAY BE UPPERMOST IN HIS MIND 
BUT FOR NOW HE'S GOT SOMETHING MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO ATTEND TO 
SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE EVERY CHINESE CITIZEN HAS BEEN REQUIRED TO CARRY AN I. D. CARD 
BEARING THEIR NAME DATE OF BIRTH AND THE REGISTRATION NUMBER OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD 
IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THE I. D. CARD BECAME ELECTRONIC 
AND CAN NOW STORE LARGE AMOUNTS OF PERSONAL DATA 
INCLUDING ANYTHING FROM QUALIFICATIONS TO CRIMINAL RECORDS 
AT PING MIN PRIMARY SCHOOL THE BIG DAY HAS ARRIVED 
THE INAUGURAL PING MIN OLYMPICS 
FOR LAO YU THE TIME HAS COME FOR HIM TO HOIST HIS HOMEMADE BANNERS 
FOR THE SCHOOL AND HEAD TEACHER MRS. ZHANG 
THEIR FIRST SPORTS DAY IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPRESS LEADERS OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITY 
WITH THEIR BEST MARCHING 
THE FIRST EVENT OF THE DAY IS A UNIQUELY CHINESE GAME 
FOR BUDDING YOUNG SUPERSTAR DAI DELI ONLY ONE OUTCOME WILL DO VICTORY 
HIS FIRST CONQUEST THE NOT SO VERY LONG LONG JUMP 
AND THE WINNER OF THIS EVENT 
DAI DELI 
NEXT CHALLENGE THE SHOT PUT 
AND GUESS WHO'S TOP DAI DELI 
DAI DELI'S ON A WINNING STREAK 
AND AT LAST IT'S TIME FOR HIS FAVOURITE EVENT 
THE FIFTY METRE DASH 
DAI DELI'S CLASSMATE CHENG CHAO IS PRETTY SURE OF WHERE HIS STRENGTHS LIE 
CHENG CHAO MAY NOT BE THE NEXT OLYMPIC TRACK HOPE 
BUT HE DOES EXCEL ELSEWHERE 
AFTER COMING TOP IN ALL HIS EVENTS 
THERE'S JUST ONE LAST CHALLENGE FOR UNDEFEATED CHAMP DAI DELI 
FOR DAI DELI LOSING MAY SEEM LIKE THE END OF THE WORLD 
BUT FOR OTHERS A WIN AT LAST IS CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION 
LAO YU PUTS HIS WRITING SKILLS TO GOOD USE AGAIN 
INSCRIBING THE NAMES OF THE WINNERS ON THE PRIZE CERTIFICATES 
AND PING MIN HAS A NEW SKIPPING CHAMP 
BUT ONE LITTLE BOY HAS SWEPT THE BOARD 
AS THE DAY COMES TO AN END 
IT'S THE TURN OF THE TEACHERS TO GET COMPETITIVE 
BACK AT HAIYANG MIDDLE SCHOOL 
RADIO CO HOSTS NING SHEJIAN AND ZHA YUJIE ARE BACK IN THE STUDIO 
THE TWO FRIENDS HAVE VERY SIMILAR LIVES AT SCHOOL 
BUT AT THE WEEKEND AS ZHA YUJIE AND THE OTHER STUDENTS GO BACK TO THEIR FAMILIES 
NING SHEJIAN RETURNS TO A VERY DIFFERENT HOME LIFE 
NING SHEJIAN WAS BROUGHT UP IN THIS WELFARE HOME JUST OUTSIDE XIUNING 
NING SHEJIAN BOARDS AT SCHOOL DURING THE WEEK 
BUT RETURNS TO THE HOME AT WEEKENDS 
THE HOME IS FOR CHILDREN WITHOUT PARENTS AND DISABLED PEOPLE 
FELLOW RESIDENT WANG LIANGMU IS BLIND 
AND IS TEACHING NING SHEJIAN TO PLAY THE ERHU 
POVERTY AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF CHINA'S ONE CHILD POLICY 
LEAD TO AN ESTIMATED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND BABIES BEING ABANDONED EVERY YEAR 
THE FATE OF THESE CHILDREN IS MOSTLY UNKNOWN BUT MANY END UP HOMELESS 
A SMALL NUMBER ARE ADOPTED BY THE STATE 
AND LIVE IN HOMES LIKE NING SHEJIAN 
NING SHEJIAN'S TEACHER IS BRIEFING HIS CLASS 
AHEAD OF TOMORROW'S ALL IMPORTANT SPORTS MEETING 
NING SHEJIAN FANCIES HIMSELF AS A LONG DISTANCE RUNNER 
AND HAS ENTERED THE TOUGHEST EVENT OF ALL 
THE THREE THOUSAND METRES 
AT HAIYANG NING SHEJIAN IS GETTING UP IN HIS SCHOOL DORMITORY 
WHERE HE LIVES DURING THE WEEK 
THROUGHOUT THE CAMPUS EXCITEMENT IS MOUNTING 
THE THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS ARE PREPARING FOR THEIR VERY OWN THREE DAY LONG HAIYANG OLYMPICS 
OH YEAH I'M VERY EXCITED THIS MORNING YEAH 
STUDENTS CHANT IN CHINESE 
RESIDENT BROADCASTER ZHA YUJIE IS ON STAGE WITH THE LOCAL DIGNITARIES 
ACTING AS TODAY'S OFFICIAL MASTER OF CEREMONIES 
IT'S HER JOB TO START PROCEEDINGS WITH THE TRADITIONAL SPEECHES IN PRAISE OF THE ATHLETES 
STUDENTS CHANT 
AS EVER THE DAY BEGINS WITH A MORNING EXERCISE ROUTINE 
BUT TODAY IT'S ELEVATED TO COMPETITIVE STATUS 
OVER THE COURSE OF THE THREE DAYS 
THE STUDENTS WILL STRIVE TO GATHER POINTS FOR THEIR CLASS 
EVERY CLASS IS COMPETING TO COME TOP IN THEIR YEAR 
WHILE EVENTS GET UNDER WAY ON BOTH TRACK AND FIELD 
XU LEI'S ALL IMPORTANT ONE HUNDRED M. HEAT IS HIS FIRST EVENT 
BEFORE XU LEI CAN SECURE HIS PLACE IN THE FINAL 
HIS SPEEDY RIVAL XIE ZICAN HAS HIS CHANCE TO PROVE HIMSELF 
WITH HIS RIVAL EASILY WINNING HIS HEAT 
XU LEI MUST PUT HIS ALL INTO HIS RACE IF HE'S TO SHINE AS WELL 
BUT FOR SOME THE STRAIN OF COMPETITION HAS BEGUN TO TAKE ITS TOLL 
IT'S A NEW DAY OF COMPETITION FIRST UP ARE THE FINALS OF THE ONE HUNDRED M. 
AHEAD OF HIS ALL IMPORTANT ONE HUNDRED M. FINAL XU LEI HAS CAUSE FOR CONCERN 
XU LEI IS SUFFERING MORE THAN JUST DEFEAT BY HIS RIVAL 
RUNNING WITH A PULLED MUSCLE MAY MEAN HIS SPORTS DAY IS OVER 
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD NING SHEJIAN WILL BE NEXT TO HIT THE TRACK 
COMPETING IN THE MOST ARDUOUS EVENT OF THE DAY THE THREE THOUSAND METRES 
WITH TWELVE LONG LAPS OF THE TRACK AHEAD OF HIM 
NING SHEJIAN SETTLES INTO A STEADY PACE AT THE BACK OF THE FIELD 
THE DISTANCE IS PROVING TO BE TOO MUCH FOR SOME 
BUT NOT FOR NING SHEJIAN WHO DESPITE BEING LAPPED 
CONTINUES TO GIVE IT HIS ALL 
HE'S GREAT YEAH HE'S JOGGING 
YES OH I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY HE'S GREAT YEAH BRILLIANT 
AS THE WINNERS CROSS THE FINISH LINE NING SHEJIAN PLOUGHS ON 
AS THE SPORTS MEETING DRAWS TO A CLOSE 
AN INJURED XU LEI HAS DECIDED TO COMPETE IN ONE LAST RACE 
IN HIS SLIPPERS 
ALTHOUGH HE HAS NO CHANCE OF WINNING A PRIZE 
JUST BEING ON THE TRACK MEANS HIS CLASS WILL ADD A POINT TO THEIR OVERALL SCORE 
WITH THE SPORTS MEETING OVER FOR ANOTHER YEAR IT'S RESULTS TIME 
ZHA YUJIE AND HER CLASSMATES WAIT EAGERLY TO HEAR WHICH CLASS HAS COME OUT TOP IN THEIR YEAR 
NEXT TIME ON CHINESE SCHOOL THE YEAR OF THE GOLDEN PIG COMES TO AN END 
BUT WILL THE WORST SNOW IN DECADES SPOIL THE NEW YEAR CELEBRATIONS
