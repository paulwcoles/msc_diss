WELCOME TO THE ONE SHOW WITH 
CHRISTINE BLAKELEY AND ADRIAN 
CHILES FROM THE ONE SHOW TEAM 
JUSTIN THE NEWS HOUND AND GEORGE 
THE BUGMAN ARE WITH US ON THE SOFA 
WE HAVE THE QUEEN OF POETRY PAM 
AYRES IS HERE PAM WILL BE JUDGING OUR BRIEFLY WAS IT WHAT 
EXPERIENCE BRIEFLY WAS IT WHAT GOING BACK TO MY OLD HOME QUITE 
DISTURBING REALLY L. KEPT HAVING 
FLASHBACKS AFTERWARDS AND THINKING 
WHAT IT HAD BEEN LIKE AND HOW SAD 
IT WAS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY 
AND IT WAS ALL SO DIFFERENT SO IT 
WAS SORT OF SAD REALLY 
IT IS A 
BUT THEIVELY FILM YOU WILL ENJOY 
WATCHING THAT STICK WITH US FOR 
THAT THAT WE SPEND EIGHTY TWO BILLION POUNDS ON 
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS EVERY YEAR BUT 
IT'S THOUGHT ONE QUARTER OF US HAVE 
OUT OF DATE MEDICINE STASHED AWAY 
WHAT ARE THE SIDE EFFECTS OF 
HOARDING MESSAGES JUSTIN HAS BEEN 
POKING HIS NOSE IN CROWDED BOTHROOM 
CABINETS CABINETS MOST OF US HAVE A FEW BOTTLES OF 
UNUSED PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES 
KNOCKING AROUND IN OUR BATHROOM 
CABINETS A FEW SLEEPING PILLS 
MAYBE MAYBE A COUPLE OF PAIN 
KILLERS BUT THE MEDICAL ADVICE IS 
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR IF YOU HAVE 
UNUSED DRUGS YOU SHOULD DISPOSE OF 
THEM SO WHY DO SO MANY OF US 
INSIST ON HOARDING OUR MEDICINES 
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION WE DECIDED 
TO TAKE A LOOK THROUGH AN AVERAGE 
BRITISH BATHROOM CUPBOARD MUM 
STEVIE SAYS SHE GETS REPEAT 
PRESCRIPTIONS JUST IN CASE SHE 
GETS CAUGHT ON THE HOP THE 
BATHROOM CABINET WHAT DO YOU HAVE 
IN HERE 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK THIS IS 
THE MEDICINE BOX THESE I ADMIT 
THEY ARE OLD 
OUT OF DATE OLD OLD OLD OLD OLD HOARDING OLD 
IS THAT THE OLD HOARDING OLD LOT 
WELL NO 
WHERE IS 
THE REST OF LOT THE STASH 
PRESIDENT BEDROOM COME COME ON LET'S CLEAR THIS OUT GOING 
THROUGH STEVIE'S MEDICINE STASH 
TOOK A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN I 
EXPECTED IN FACT IT WENT ON AND ON 
AND ON SHE EVEN HAD MEDICINE IN 
THE FRIDGE 
WHAT AMAZES ME IS WHY YOU HAVE GOT 
SO MANY DRUGS THAT YOU DIDN'T 
ACTUALLY NEED 
I WAS EYE FRAYED 
THAT MAYBE OVER A LONG WEEKEND I 
WOULD RUN OUT OF ONE FOR THE KIDS 
YOU ARE DELIBERATELY GETTING EXTRA 
DRUGS AND HOARDING THEM 
I'M AFRAID 
OF NOT BEING ABLE TO LOOK AFTER THE 
KIDS 
COULD YOU AVOID HOARDING KIDS DRUGS IN THE FUTURE SERIOUSLY I I THINK I COULD L. COULD PERHAPS EVEN 
TELL THE DOCTOR I DON'T NEED THAT 
MUCH 
REPENTENT STEVIE CAN'T BE THE MUCH ONLY GUILTYER PARTY L. KNOCKED ON A 
FEW OF HER NEIGHBOURS' DOORS TO 
GIVE US AN IDEA OF JUST HOW MUCH 
MEDICINE WASTING AWAY 
FROM JUST FIVE HOUSES IN THIS 
STREET I HAVE COLLECTED THIS 
MASSIVE STASH OF DRUGS AND 
EVERYONE I WAS SPOKEN TO HAS 
ADMITTED THEY HAVEN'T BEEN USED IN 
MONTHS AND IT IS YOU THE TAX 
PAYER THAT IS PICKING UP THE TAB 
FOR THIS EVEN IF YOU PAY FOR YOUR 
PRESCRIPTIONS N. H. S. MONEY OFTEN 
SUBSIDISES THE TRUE COST OF THE 
MEDICATION THE DEPARTMENT OF 
HEALTH ESTIMATES THAT THE REAL COST 
OF ANNUAL WASTAGE COULD BE AS HIGH 
AS EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION 
THAT'S A LOT OF ZEROS IT IS ENOUGH 
MONEY FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND HEART BYPASS 
OPERATIONS OPERATIONS ALMOST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND HIP REPLACEMENT 
OPERATIONS OPERATIONS OOPS OOPS OR THE YEARLY WAGES OF FORTY THOUSAND NEW 
NURSES WITH SO MUCH MONEY BEING 
WASTED THE N. H. S. HAS TO BE MORE 
SELECTIVE ABOUT THE KINDS OF DRUGS 
IT PAYS FOR AS BARBARA FROM 
WORCESTER DISCOVERED WHEN SHE WAS 
DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER LAST YEAR IT IT REALLY FELT DEVASTATING AND 
FURTHERMORE I WAS TOLD I HAD ONLY 
GOT THREE MONTHS TO LIVE WHEN WHEN INITIAL TREATMENT FAILED TO SHRINK 
HER TUMOUR BARBARA'S SPECIALIST 
RECOMMENDED A NEW MEDICINE WITH 
THE POTENTIAL TO SAVE HER LIFE BUT 
THERE WAS A CATCH 
HE SAID YES IT 
IS AVAILABLE BUT IT WASN'T 
AVAILABLE ON THE N. H. S. UNFORTUNATELY 
THEY LOOK AT WHETHER IT IS WORTH 
SPENDING THE MONEY AND THEY FIND AT 
THE MOMENT THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT 
DATA TO SHOW THAT THESE DRUGS ARE 
COST EFFECTIVE SO IT IS ONLY THERE 
IF YOU CAN PAY FOR IT WE HAVE PAID 
TWENTY ONE THOUSAND WHICH HAS BEEN FUNDED BY 
MY ELDERLY MOTHER AND OURSELVES 
THE N. H. S. HAS ALY ITED AMOUNT OF 
MONEY TO SPEND ON DRUGS LIMITED 
AMOUNT OF MONEY TO SPEND ON DRUGS 
UNTIL WE STOP HOARDING MEDICINES WE 
DON'T NEED MILLIONS THAT COULD BE 
SPENT ON LIFE SAVING TREATMENTS FOR 
PATIENTS LIKE BARBARA IS SIMPLY 
BEING BURNED THE INDUSTRY IS 
URGING ALL OF TO US GIVE OUR 
MEDICINE CABINETS GOOD SPRING CLEAN 
WE HAVE JUST DONE A SURVEY CLEAN PROBABLY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE 
POPULATION HAVE GOT AN OUT OF DATE 
MEDICINE IN THEIR BATROOM CABINET 
WE RECKON THERE ARE FORTY MILLION 
PRESCRIPTION ITEMS SITTING IN 
BATHROOM CABINETS DOING NOTHING 
COULD IT BE THAT DOCTORS ARE 
PRESCRIBING TOO MUCH MEDICINE IT IT IS AN EASY ACCUSATION IN MY TIME 
IN PRACTICE WHEN PEOPLE HAVE DIED 
I HAVE GONE INTO PEOPLE'S HOUSES 
AND PICKED UP SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN BOTTLES OF 
UNOPENED EYE DROPS YOU HAVE TO ASK 
THE QUESTION WHO IS KEEPING TABS 
ON THAT AND WHY ISN'T SOMEBODY 
BEING TOLD 
WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE DO 
I F. MEDICINE IS PRESCRIBED THE 
THING TO DO IS TAKE IT THAT'S 
WHAT IT IS PRESCRIBED FOR BUT IF 
THERE ARE ANY ISSUES THEY SHOULD 
GO TO THE PHARMACIST OR G. P. WHERE 
ANY ISSUES WHICH HAVE ARISEN CAN BE 
SORTED OUT 
BARBARA SAYS HER 
EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT HER THAT 
HOARDING MEDICINE IS A SCANDAL 
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO GET 
THEIR REPEAT PRESCRIPTIONS WITHOUT 
THINKING ABOUT IT THEY DO IT 
INNOCENTLY I WOULD ASK THEM TO 
THINK TWICE BECAUSE THERE ARE 
PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF WHO NEEDED 
THAT FUNDING FROM THE N. H. S. WHO 
NEEDED THAT TO SAVE THEIR LIFE A A STARK EXAMPLE THERE OF THE COST OF 
WASTE WASTE WHY IS IT HAPPENING WHO DO WE 
BLAME 
PART OF THE PROBLEM IS BLAME PEOPLE GO TO THE DOCTOR AND WANT TO 
BE PRESCRIBED MEDICINES PERHAPS 
THEY DON'T NEED AND THE DOCTORS 
DON'T WANT THEM TO GO AWAY 
UNHAPPY 
IF THEY HAVE GONE TO THE UNHAPPY TROUBLE OF GOING AND NOT TAKING 
THEM I DON'T UNDERSTAND 
IT IS 
RIDICULOUS ALL OF US WOULD ADMIT 
WE HAVE A FEW OUT OF DATE MEDICINES 
IN OUR CABINETS THERE ARE PROBLEMS 
IF YOU HAVE OUT OF DATE MEDICINES 
LIKE FOODS THEY CAN GO OFF IF YOU 
TAKE THEM THEY WON'T TREAT PROBLEM 
YOU ARE TRYING TO CURE OR THEY CAN 
CONTAIN BACTERIA IF YOU USE 
SUNSCREEN AND LEAVE IT TOO LORNINGS 
YOU CAN GET REAL SUNBURN SO CLEAN 
IT OUT BUT DON'T ASK FOR REPEAT 
PRESCRIPTIONS IF YOU DON'T NEED 
THEM AND DON'T ENCOURAGE THE DOCTOR 
TO GIVE YOU MEDICINES YOU DON'T 
NEED 
THAT'S THE BIGGEST PROBLEM NEED PEOPLE HAVE MEDICINES BECAUSE 
DOCTORS ARE PRESCRIBING THEM 
THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING IS TOO MUCH 
MEDICINES ARE BEING PRESCRIBED IS IS THAT TRUE ABOUT SUNSCREEN I HAVE 
SUNSCREEN GOING BACK IT THE SIXTY 
DON'T USE IT THROW IT AWAY I I NEVER BELIEVE IN WASTING ANYTHING 
I HAVE TO BIN IT 
ARE YOU A 
HOARDING THEN 
I AM A BIT BUT I'M 
FEELING VIRTUOUS NOW BECAUSE I HAVE 
JUST BOUGHT FOUR BOOKS ON CLEARING 
THE CLUTTER WE HAVE TACKLED THE 
MEDICINE CABINET IT IS IMMACULATE 
THERE IS NOTHING IN THERE 
NOW YOU 
HAVE A CLUTTER OF BOOKS 
I HAVE 
YES 
I BOUGHT A DECLUTTERING BOOK YES AND LOST IT AMIDST THE CLUTTER BUT 
THERE IS NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN 
BECAUSE THERE WAS A CAMPAIGN ABOUT 
THIS IN THE SEVENTY AND YOU WROTE A 
POEM 
YES IT IS THE MOST AMAZING POEM COINCIDENCE MUCH THIS IS JUST A 
LITTLE BIT OF IT BUT IT WAS 
EXACTLY THE SAME THING NOT KEEPING 
OLD DRUGS AND NOT GIVING THEM TO 
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE YOU IN YOUR 
CUPBOARDS DUSTY MEDICINES GROWN 
OLD AND FUSTY KEPT FOR SOME 
FORGOTTEN PAIN IN CASE IT SHOULD 
COME BACK AGAIN OR TABLETS VERY 
KINDLY LENT BY WHAT'S HIS NAME 
WHEREVER HE WENT WHICH CURED HIS 
SINUS LIKE A CHARM BUT NEVER 
TOUCHED YOUR BROKEN ARM 
OH DUMP IT DUMP IT DUMP IT ALL 
FAR AWAY FROM FINGERS SMALL AND 
OLDER FOLK WHO GET CONFUSED TAKE 
ANY DRUG THAT'S PARTLY USED ANY 
OINTMENT PILLS OR POSITIONS 
LINTUS LINAMENTS OR LOTIONS 
RESOLUTELY IN YOUR FIST AND DUMP IT 
ON YOUR PHARMACIST SUPERB SUPERB VERY GOOD WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND 
MONEY YOUR FILM WAS PAM SHOULD 
HAVE JUST READ THE POEM 
TWO FOR 
THE PRICE OF ONE OR THE OTHER WAY 
AROUND 
FROM NOSING ABOUT IN OTHER AROUND PEOPLE'S BATHROOMS WE ARE ABOUT TO 
FERRET OUR WAY THROUGH A STRANGER'S 
HOUSE IT IS THE PLACE PAM AYRES 
ONCE CALLED HOME PAM CONTINUES A 
ONE SHOW TRADITION OF RETURNING TO 
THE HOUSE SHE GREW UP IN A TWO UP 
TWO DOWN COUNCIL HOUSE IN 
OXFORDSHIRE 
I WAS BORN IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN IN THE FRONT 
BEDROOM OF WHAT WAS THEN NUMBER TWO 
CAMPDEAN IT HAS DIFFERENT 
ADDRESS NOW AND THERE WAS MY MUM 
AND DAD MY FOUR OLDER BROTHERS AND 
MY OLDER SISTER JEAN IT WAS 
FUNNY HOUSE IT WAS A VERY LOVING 
HOME FROM MY MOTHER BUT IT WAS A 
VERY STORMY MARRIAGE SO IT IS 
GOING TO BE MIXED FEELINGS REALLY 
SOME OF THE TIME I WAS VERY HAPPY 
THERE AND OTHER TIMES I WAS PRETTY 
NERVOUS 
OH WELL THIS IS EXTREMELY 
DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY IT WAS OF 
COURSE WHEN I LIVED HERE IT IS ALL 
PALE AND POSH BUT THIS WAS CALLED 
THE OTHER ROOM WE DIDN'T REALLY 
CALL IT THE FRONT ROOM IT WOULD BE 
LET'S GO AND SIT IN THE OTHER 
ROOM WE ONLY HAD THE TWO 
CERTAINLY MY MOTHER DID TRY AND 
KEEP IT NICE AND THERE WERE 
PHOTOGRAPHS AND ORNAMENTS ON THE 
SIDEBOARD AND SHE DID VERY WELL L. 
MEAN HER LIFE MUST HAVE BEEN 
ABSOLUTE DRUDGERY BUT SHE ALWAYS 
KEPT THIS ROOM NICE L. MUST HAVE 
SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME IN THIS 
ROOM I'M SURE I DID MY MOST VIVID 
MEMORIES ARE OF THE KITCHEN WHERE 
FAMILY LIFE WAS CONDUCTED AND WHERE 
WE ATE AND SQUABBLED AND WHERE WE 
MOSTLY SPENT OUR TIME 
WHEY FEEL STANDING HERE IS SOME 
SENSE OF HOW MY MOTHER MUST HAVE 
FELT AS SHE STOOD HERE FOR ALL 
THOSE YEARS IN FRONT OF THIS OLD 
SINK WHEN I LOOK OUT THIS WINDOW 
I FEEL REALLY SAD FOR HER SHE 
DESERVED EVERYTHING AND SHE HAD A 
VERY VERY HARD LIFE 
MY DAD WAS A VERY VOLATILE MAN L. 
THINK HE WAS IN THE WAR AND HE WAS 
AFFECTED BY THAT BECAUSE HE USED 
TO GO INTO THESE TERRIBLE RAGES 
WHICH DID TERRIFY US ALL OF US 
WERE SCARED STIFF OF THE NEXT ONE 
AND 
ONE DAY I FLED JUST WENT OUT ONE NIGHT THERE WAS THIS TERRIFIC 
ROW GOING ON AND FLED OUT OF THAT 
DOOR AND I WENT DOWN TO THIS PONY I 
USED TO LIKE AT THE OTHER END 
VILLAGE AND I THINK THEY MUST HAVE 
PANICKED AND REALISED I HAD GONE 
AND COME OUT LOOKING FOR ME AND 
FOUND ME DOWN BY THIS PONY BECAUSE 
I COULDN'T STAND IT L. THINK 
PROBABLY MY DAD HAD POST TRAUMATIC 
STRESS YOU KNOW THE THINGS THAT 
NOWADAYS PEOPLE ARE TREATED FOR 
LOVED HIM DEARLY HE WAS A GOOD DAD 
BUT HE DID HAVE THESE TERRIFIC 
RAGES WHICH TERRIFIED US ALL CAN 
STILL FEEL THE VESTAGES OF THAT IN 
THIS HOUSE STANDING IN THE GARDEN 
NOW I THINK OF MY DAD HE WAS A 
VERY VERY KEEN GARDENER HE USED 
TO LAUGH WHEN HE SAW CABBAGES IN 
THE POST OFFICE DOWN IN THE VILLAGE 
THEY SOLD A BIT OF GREEN GROCERY 
THEY SOLD THE CALLLY FLOWERS AND 
THE BOTTOM WOULD BE YELLOW THEY 
HAVE BEEN CUT FOR SO LONG AND HE 
WOULD LAUGH AND SAY FANCY BUYING 
OLD TACKLE LIKE THAT BECAUSE HIS 
WERE SO LOVELY AND FRESH 
UM IT IS AMAZING TO THIS AGAIN 
THIS WAS MY MUM AND DAD'S ROOM 
THIS HAD ALWAYS HAD AUTO BLUE AND 
WHITE BEDSPREAD ON IT AND A BOLSTER 
IT HAD AND IT HAS A LOVELY VIEW 
DOWN THE VILLAGE WE HAD SINGLE 
BED HERE WITH THE TWO GIRLS IN MUM 
AND DAD WERE HERE AND I HAD THREE 
BROTHERS IN THAT BEDROOM AND ONE 
BROTHER IN THE OTHER BEDROOM WE 
WERE WELL AND TRULY PACKED IN 
THINK MY BROTHERS WERE UNWITTINGLY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR ME GETTING 
INTERESTED IN WRITING FUNNYERS 
HAVES THEY USED TO BRING HOME THE 
FUNNY VERSES THEY USED TO BRING 
HOME THE MUSIC OF THE DAY LIKE 
LONNIE DONEGAN DOES YOUR CHEWING 
GUM LOOSE ITS FLAVOUR LISTENED 
TO THEM AND WHEN I WAS OLDER I 
WOULD WRITE MY OWN PARODIES L. WOULD GET RID OF THE WORDS TO THEIR 
SONGS AND PUT MY OWN WORDS TO IT 
DID IT WHEN I WAS YOUNG WOULDN'T 
HAVE DONE THAT IF I HADN'T HEARD 
THE MUSIC MY BROTHERS BROUGHT HOME 
I FIND IT QUITE SAD I'M TRYING TO 
ANALYSE WHY THAT IS L. SUPPOSE IT 
IS BECAUSE TIME HAS MOVED ON AND 
THE PEOPLE THAT I LOVED HERE ARE 
GONE GONE I FEEL AN INTENSE GRATITUDE TO MY 
MUM BECAUSE SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED 
WRITING CAREER SHE PROBABLY COULD 
HAVE DONE IT IF SHE HAD THE 
OPPORTUNITIES SHE ENCOURAGED ME 
AND NEVER MADE YOU FEEL THERE WAS 
NOTHING YOU COULDN'T DO SHE 
ENCOURAGED YOU TO GO FOR IT AND I 
WENT FOR IT AND I HOPED SHE WOULD 
BE PLEASED 
FANTASTIC REALLY LOVELY 
I FEEL 
REALLY SAD ABOUT THAT 
IT SWEEPS US 
ALL BACK I THINK WITH YOU WHAT 
WAS IT LIKE OUTSIDE THE HOUSE THERE 
AS WELL WE GOT TO SEE YOU INSIDE 
BUT THE SMELLS I THINK IS ALWAYS A 
BIG THING THAT YOU GO BACK TO 
SOMEWHERE 
I TELL YOU THE THING SOMEWHERE THAT REALLY HIT ME WAS THE GARDENS 
WHEN WE LIVED THERE THEY WERE SO 
PRODUCTIVE EVERYBODY HAD CHICKENS 
AND THERE WAS ROW UPON ROW OF ALL 
THE VEGETABLES THAT YOU THINK OF 
AND THAT BIT OF GROUND PRODUCED 
TONNES OF FOOD AND NOW I DIDN'T 
SEE ANY VEGETABLES AT ALL L. MEAN 
PEOPLE ARE BUSIER DOING DIFFERENT 
THINGS BUT IT USED TO BE SO 
PRODUCTIVE PRODUCTIVE IT SEEMS A SHAME DOESN'T IT THE 
MARRIAGE GUIDANCE CHARITY RELATE 
HAS OPENED ITS ARCHIVES SUPPOSE 
IT SHOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE TO US 
THAT THERE WERE SO MANY MARRIAGE 
PROBLEMS ON THE POST WAR YEARS YOU 
TOUCHED UPON THAT AND THOUGHT MAYBE 
YOUR DAD HAD POST TRAUMATIC STRESS 
DISORDER 
WELL HE HAD TERRIBLE DISORDER EXPERIENCES IN THE WAR TESH HE 
NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT TO ME L. KNOW 
HE DID IT MUST HAVE AFFECTED HIM 
THERE WAS NO ONE FOR THEM TO GO TO 
FOR HELP THEY WERE LEFT TO DEAL 
WITH IT AS BEST THEY COULD L. KNOW 
HE HAD HORRIFIC EXPERIENCES AS I'M 
SURE MOST OF THEM DID YOU DON'T 
JUST FOREGET ABOUT THAT AND BLANK 
IT OUT 
YOU FELT LIKE YOUR MUM HAD 
A TOUGH TIME WE CAN SEE A PICTURE 
OF HER HERE SHE WOULD LIKED TO 
HAVE BEEN A WRITER 
SHE WAS OFFERED 
A SCHOLARSHIP BUT HER MOTHER WAS 
WIDOWED AND THERE WAS FIVE OF THEM 
SO THE CHANCES OF HER GETTING A 
NICE POSH UNIFORM AND GOING OFF IT 
THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL WERE NIL SO SHE 
WAS NEVER ABLE TO DEVELOP THE LOVE 
SHE HAD FOR WRITING SHE CERTAINLY 
HELPED ME IT DIDN'T MATTER HOW 
MUCH FOOD SHE WAS TRYING TO COOK 
IF YOU COULDN'T SPELL A WORD OR IF 
YOU WERE STUCK SHE WOULD ALWAYS 
HELP SHE ALWAYS REALLY HELPED ME 
OUT OUT WE HAVE CLIP OF YOU FROM BLUE 
PETER WHEN THIS IS WHEN I 
CERTAINLY FIRST BECAME AWARE OF YOU 
I PROBABLY WATCHED THIS VERY 
EDITION 
NOT A WRINKLE ON THIS EDITION VISAGE 
HOW I LAUGHED AT MY MOTHER'S FALSE 
TEETH AS THEY FOAMED IN THE WATERS 
BENEATH BUT NOW COMES THE 
RECKONING IT'S ME THEY ARE 
BECKONING OH I WISH I HAD LOOKED 
AFTER ME TEETH 
DID YOU 
THEY'RE NOT BAD ACTUALLY 
I WISH I HAD LOOKED AFTER THEM 
BETTER THAN I DID THEY ARE ALL 
MINE 
BEE KEEPING IS ONE OF YOUR MINE HOBBIES 
ONE EVER MY HOBBIES YES HOBBIES I HAVE TWO COLONIES OF BEES HAVE HAVE YOU GOT A HEALTHY HIVE 
COLONY OR 
HIVE YES YES THEY LOOK GOOD AS 
SOON AS THE SUN STARTS TO SHINE 
OUT THEY ALL COME THEY ARE A NICE 
MARKER OF THE SEASONS YOU THINK 
THE BEES ARE FLYING THE SUMMER IS 
COMING 
BRITAIN'S HONEY BEES HAVE COMING BEEN UNDER A MAJOR THREAT FROM THE 
DEADLY VERROAMITE NOW A VIRUS 
COULD BE ON ITS WAY HERE GEORGE 
MCGAVIN HAS A BEE IN HIS BONET 
ABOUT HOW WE DEAL WITH THIS TWIN 
ATTACK ON BRITAIN'S MOST VALUABLE 
INSECT INSECT THE HUMBLE HONEY BEE IS ONE OF THE 
MOST FAMINE SECRETARIES IN THE 
WORLD AND OUR FASCINATION WITH IT 
HAS LASTS THOUSANDS OF YEARS EVER 
SINCE WE FOUND OUT HOW GOOD HONEY 
IS HEAVEN OUR IT IS UNDER THREAT 
FROM A GROWING NUMBER OF PESTS AND 
DISEASES THE VERROA MITE IS 
HEADING NORTH 
THE GOVERNMENT ACCEPTS THERE IS A 
PROBLEM BUT THEY CLAIM THEY CAN'T 
AFFORD THE EIGHT MILLION THE 
BEEKEEPERS SAY THEY NEED FOR 
RESEARCH HONEY BEES CONTRIBUTE 
HUNDREDS AND MILLIONS OF POUNDS TO 
THE ECONOMY OF THIS COUNTRY 
WITHOUT THEM WE WOULDN'T HAVE FRUIT 
VEGETABLES OR FLOWERS THE PLACE 
WOULD BE A MESS IF THE U. K. WERE TO 
LOSE ITS HONEY BEES THE FACE OF THE 
COUNTRYSIDE WOULD CHANGE FOREVER 
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE 
BEEKEEPERS FEAR COULD HAPPEN THERE THERE ARE NO RULES ABOUT HAVING A HIVE 
ANYBODY COULD HAVE A HIVE BUT YOU 
REALLY HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE 
DOING 
THAT IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS DOING LOTS OF PEOPLE THINK IT'S THE IN 
THING TO BE GREEN TO KEEP BEES AND 
THEN IF THEY DON'T LOOK AFTER THEIR 
BEES BECAUSE THEY GET PROBLEMS 
THEY LEAVE DISEASED HIVES AROUND 
AND OTHER BEES SPREAD THE DISEASE 
AROUND 
THESE GUYS LOOK FANTASTIC AROUND THIS IS A JOB THAT IS SO ESSENTIAL 
WITHOUT HONEY BEES AND OTHER BEES 
WHICH ARE ALSO IN DECLINE WE WOULD 
LOSE ALL THE ORCHARD CROPS WE 
WOULD LOSE FRUIT CROPS VEGETABLE 
CROPS 
IT WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR CROPS MANKIND I CAN'T IMAGINE A WORLD 
WITHOUT THE THINGS I LIKE WE 
WOULDN'T HAVE A BASIC ONION 
WHATEVER YOU THINK OF SOMEWHERE 
DOWN THE LINE THE HONEY BEE 
PROVIDES PART OF THAT FOOD CHAIN 
SO SHOULD WE BE ANXIOUS ABOUT THE 
BEE I THINK WE PROBABLY SHOULD WE 
SPEND SPEND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS 
OF POUNDS ON ASTRONOMY RESEARCH BUT 
THE HEALTH OF HONEY BEES PERHAPS 
SOME OF THE MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT 
ON THEM 
GEORGE WOULD YOU GO AS FAR AS TO 
SAY THIS IS CATASTROPHIC IF WE 
LOSE OUR BEE POPULATION 
YES IF 
LOSE THE BEES IN THE U. K. IT WILL BE 
A DISASTER IT COULD EVEN HAPPEN L. 
AM REALLY PLEASED THAT WE ARE NOW 
ABOUT TO HAVE AN EXERCISE WHERE ALL 
THE BEE FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE 
INTERVIEWED AND ASKED FOR THEIR 
OPINION AT THE END OF THIS WHEN 
ALL THE RESULTS ARE IN THE 
ENVIRONMENT AND FOOD AND AFFAIRS 
DEPARTMENT WILL ACTUALLY HAVE A 
TEN YEAR PLAN FOR BEE HEALTH WHICH 
IS A GOOD THING 
IN THE MEANTIME 
THERE ARE LOADS OF BEES DYING 
PEOPLE HAVE TO KEEP THEIR BEES 
BETTER 
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT SOME BETTER PEOPLE DON'T LOOK AFTER THEIR BEES 
WELL ENOUGH AND THE ADVICE WHICH IS 
HANDED IS NOT ALWAYS TAKEN UP WHAT WHAT WOULD YOUR ADVICE BE TO AN 
ENTHUSIAST WHO WANTS TO KEEP BEES 
YOU HAVE TO TREAT FOR VERROA 
BECAUSE IF YOU LET THEM GET 
INFECTED THE INFECTED BEES WILL GO 
OFF AND INFECT SOMEBODY ELSE'S YOU 
HAVE TO PUT THESE STRIPS IN NOBODY 
WANTS TO YOU WOULD RATHER LEAVE 
THEM ALONE 
THERE IS A PROBLEM 
THERE AS WELL THEY ARE IMMUNE TO 
THAT 
YOU TAKE ADVICE FROM YOUR THAT BRITISH BEE KEEPING ASSOCIATION 
THEY WILL GIVE YOU AUN THE THINGS 
ABOUT WHAT THREATS THERE ARE WE WE HAVE BRITAIN'S MOST EXPENSIVE JAR 
OF HONEY HERE IT'S FORTY I THINK I I COULD SELL YOU ONE FOR HALF THE 
PRICE 
THAT'S ABOUT THREE ON MY FINGER PRICE IT TASTES LIKE ANY OTHER HONEY 
WHY IS IT SO EXPENSIVE HAD 
IT HAS 
HEALING QUALITIES HERE IS ANOTHER 
CELEBRITY BEEKEEPER RELUCTANT HERE 
IN ACTION 
THAT IS ONE SCARY SOUND FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
BEES BEES I THINK I HAVE HAD ENOUGH HERE 
ETHEL IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE THE 
SAME CALMING EFFECT ON ME L. WILL 
LEAVE YOU TO IT 
YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE OUTFIT 
I'M NOT THAT VAIN 
IT IS VERY SCARY 
WHEN YOU FIRST HANDLE BEES AND THEY 
ARE ON YOUR LEGS AND ARMS SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE EVERY 
INSTINCT IS TO BRUSH THEM OFF YOU 
HAVE TO TRY AND CONTROL THAT I'M 
ON YOUR SIDE
