AND THE GORDON BROWN BACKS DOWN 
OVER THE TEN PENCE TAX ROW 
NEIGHBOUR'S REBELS HAVE GOT WHAT 
THEY WANTED THE U. TURN MEANS TAX 
LOSERS WILL GET COMPENSATION ISN'T ISN'T IT CASE THAT THE LABOUR PARTY HAVE 
FINALLY WORKED OUT THEY HAVE A 
LOSER NOT A LEADER 
WE OFFER 
OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE THEY 
OFFER OPPORTUNITIES AND IN 
EVERYTHING 
WE WILL BE ASKING HOW EVERYTHING MUCH DAMAGE THIS HAS DONE TO THE 
BROWN PREMIERSHIP 
POLICE HUNTING FOR MISSING JAMES 
HUGHES HAVE FOUND THE BODY TWO 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED ON 
SUSPICION OF MURDER 
HOW AN ANGRY BUILDER TELLS WITH A 
CLIENT WHO DID NOT PAY WHAT WENT 
UP MUST COME DOWN 
WHAT A START FOR MANCHESTER UNITED 
BUT AFTER THAT SHOCKER AGAINST 
BARCELONA WILL THEY RECOVER IN THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
IN B. B. C. LONDON IS THE MET GOING 
SOFT ON DRUGS THIS FORCE IS 
ISSUING MORE CAUTIONED FOR 
POSSESSION OF CLASS A 
WHY THE CAPITAL'S WHITE VAN MEN ARE 
FINDING IT HARD TO GO GREEN 
GOOD EVENING CALL IT A U. TURN 
CALL IT A CONCESSION GORDON BROWN 
HAS CHANGED HIS MIND OVER THE TEN 
PENCE TAX ROW FACED WITH THE MOST 
SERIOUS BACKBENCH CHALLENGE MR. 
BROWN SAID THE GOVERNMENT WILL 
COMPENSATE SOME OF THE FIVE MILLION 
FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST OUT 
CRUCIALLY SOME OF IT WILL BE 
BACKDATED IN FIERY EXCHANGES 
DAVID CAMERON CALLED THE PRIME 
MINISTER AND LOSER AND NOT A LEADER 
SCRAPPING THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE WAS 
HURTING GORDON BROWN WAS TOLD 
AGAIN AND AGAIN HE WOULDN'T LISTEN 
UNTIL TODAY WHEN FINALLY HE 
SHIFTED THE ANSWER WAS THAT WARNED 
HE WOULD FACE DEFEAT HE CHANGED 
HIS MIND BUT HE INSISTED HE NEVER 
ALTERED HIS COMMITMENT TO FOR 
HELPING THE POOR 
THIS GOVERNMENT 
HAS DONE MORE THAN ANY GOVERNMENT 
IN A CENTURY TO HELP CHILD POVERTY 
AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES THERE ARE 
BETTER WAYS OF HELPING BETTER 
INCOME FAMILIES THAN THE TEN PENCE 
RATE 
HE PROMISED COMPENSATION FOR RATE THOSE HARDEST HIT BACKDATED FROM 
THE DATE THEY BEGAN TO LOSE OUT IT 
WAS DAVID CAMERON SAID A PANIC 
CONCESSION 
DOES THE PRIME MINISTER CONCESSION HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT A PATHETIC 
FIGURE HE CUTS TODAY HE IS MAKING 
THESE CHANGES BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE 
WOULD LOSE THE VOTE HIS DISLIKE 
THE GENERAL ELECTION HE CANCELLED 
EVEN THOUGH HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING 
TO WIN IT IS IT THE CASE THE 
LABOUR PARTY HAVE WORKED OUT THEY 
HAVE A LOSER NOT A LEADER IT IT WASN'T ONLY THE TORIES 
THE PRIME 
MINISTER USED TO BE A MAN OF 
PRINCIPLE BUT IF HE CANNOT DELIVER 
ON POVERTY WHAT IS THE POINT OF 
THIS INCREASINGLY POINTLESS PRIME 
MINISTER 
THIS CRISIS HAS A LONG MINISTER FUSE IT WAS IN HIS LAST BUDGET AS 
CHANCELLOR GORDON BROWN CUT THE 
BASIC RATE OF INCOME TAX AND PAID 
FOR IT BY SCRAPPING THE TEN PENCE 
RATE THAT IS NOT BEING REINSTATED 
BUT HIS FARM PROMISING HELP FOR 
OLDER PEOPLE AND YOUNGER PEOPLE 
WITH CHILDREN THE GROUPS WHO DO 
NOT BENEFIT FROM HIGHER TAX 
BENEFITS MANY OTHER PEOPLE WERE 
NEWS THE LABOUR REBELLION IS NOW 
OFF 
I AM IMMENSELY PLEASED WITH OFF THE ACTION THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN 
BECAUSE OF ALL IT IS GOING TO BRING 
PROPER COMPENSATION TO THOSE WHO 
WOULD OTHERWISE LOSE OUT LABOUR LABOUR REBELS WERE NOT THE ONLY ONES TO BE 
PLEASED THE CONSERVATIVES CANNOT 
BELIEVE THEIR LUCK AND A TELLING 
VOTERS NOT TO BELIEVE THAT TODAY'S 
ANNOUNCEMENT WILL SOLVE THEIR TAX 
WORRIES 
WE WILL BE CHECKING TO WORRIES MAKE SURE FIRST STILL AREN'T LOSERS 
FROM THE BUDGET AND FROM WHAT HE 
HAS DONE WITH THIS PRIME MINISTER 
ALWAYS CHECK THE SMALL PRINT WOULD WOULD PEOPLE SAY IT IS A BIT RICH BEING 
LECTURED ON POLICY BY THE TORY 
PARTY 
NOT A TALL WHAT WE HAVE PARTY SEEN FROM THIS GOVERNMENT THERE 
ARE MORE PEOPLE IN EXTREME POVERTY 
AND THEY ARE GETTING POORER 
WHEN I 
SPOKE TO THE PRIME MINISTER I 
REMINDED HIM HE TOLD ME AND HIS M. P.'S 
HE WOULDN'T BE CHANGING HIS 
POSITION BUT NOW HE HAD 
I DON'T 
THINK I HAVE BEEN PUSHED ABOUT WE 
KEPT A FUNDAMENTAL DECISION WHICH 
IS RIGHT TO CHANGE THE TEMPO AND 
RATE BUT WE HAVE LISTENED TO WHAT 
PEOPLE ARE SAYING AND WE HAVE MADE 
THE CHANGES AS A RESULT WHAT WHAT CHANGED BETWEEN LAST WEEK WHEN YOU 
TOLD ME YOU WOULDN'T MOVE AGAIN 
AND AGAIN YOU HAVE TOLD YOUR M. P.'S 
YOU WOULDN'T MOVE IN THE FACE OF A 
DEFEAT YOU MOVE 
WHAT I SAID WAS I 
WOULDN'T CHANGE THE DECISION TO 
ABOLISH THE TEN PENCE RATE 
IF YOU 
BELIEVE THAT HE IS DOING WHAT IS 
RIGHT YOU MAY NOT BE BOTHERED IT 
IS CALLED A U. TURN BUT THE WORLD 
OF POLITICS IS NOT SO UNDERSTANDING 
WHAT EXACTLY ARE THE PROPOSED 
CHANGES WHO WILL END UP PAYING FOR 
THE COMPENSATION OUR ECONOMICS 
CORRESPONDENT HAS BEEN LOOKING AT 
THE FIGURES 
THE SCRAPPING OF THE TEN PENCE TAX 
RATE AND THE SUBSEQUENT U. TURN 
AFFECT A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE WERE 
MORE WINNERS THAN LOSERS FROM LAST 
YEAR'S BUDGET CHANGES BUT THIS HAS 
BEEN ABOUT THE FIFTY THREE MILLION FAMILIES 
LEFT WORSE OFF BY THE POLICIES WHEN 
THEY KICKED IN THIS MONTH THE 
LOSERS ARE PEOPLE WHO EARN LESS 
THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR AND DON'T GET 
ANY HELP FROM THE TAX CREDIT SYSTEM 
WHO ARE THEY 
FIRST OF ALL PEOPLE UNDER TWENTY FIVE 
WITHOUT CHILDREN THE CHANCELLOR 
SAYS HE CAN HELP THEM WITH WORKING 
TAX CREDITS WHICH THEY DON'T GET 
OR BY BOOSTING THE MINIMUM WAGE 
THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE AGED SIXTY TO SIXTY FOUR 
SOME WHO HAVE TAKEN EARLY 
RETIREMENT THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR 
AGE RELATED TAX ALLOWANCES MR. 
DARLING SAYS HE CAN USE WINTER FUEL 
ALLOWANCES TO HELP 
HOW MUCH WILL IT COST THE TREASURY 
WASN'T GIVING TOO MUCH AWAY IF THE 
MEASURES ARE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
THERE WILL BE A PRICE TAG AND THE 
MONEY WILL HAVE TO COME FROM 
SOMEWHERE SOMEWHERE THE CHALLENGE FOR THE CHANCELLOR IS 
TO SEE IF HE CAN COMPENSATE ENOUGH 
OF THE LOSERS FROM LAST YEAR'S 
BUDGET TO STOP THE POLITICAL 
DIFFICULTIES RESURFACING AT THE 
TIME OF THE PRE BUDGET REPORT 
WITHOUT HAVING TO SPEND SO MUCH 
MONEY HE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING MORE 
UNPOPULAR TO PAY FOR IT 
THERE WILL 
STILL BE THOSE WHO DON'T GAIN EVEN 
AFTER THIS COMPENSATION PACKAGE 
PEOPLE UNDER SIXTY WHO ARE NOT WORKING 
WON'T BE COVERED NOR WILL THOSE 
PART TIME WORKERS WHO DON'T QUALIFY 
FOR TAX CREDITS AND IT IS 
EMPLOYERS WHO PAY THE MINIMUM WAGE 
THEY WILL PICK UP THE TAB IF THE 
GOVERNMENT WANTS IT RAISED THERE 
ARE MORE DETAILS TO COME AND 
POSSIBLY ANOTHER ROW WHEN THE 
CHANCELLOR FINALISES THE PACKAGE 
LATER THIS YEAR 
WE CAN GO LIVE TO A POLITICAL 
EDITOR AT WESTMINSTER JUST HOW 
DAMAGING IS THIS GOING TO BE FOR 
THE PRIME MINISTER 
IT IS DAMAGING TO HIS AUTHORITY 
GIVEN HE SAID ONE THING AND 
WOULDN'T DO SOMETHING NOW HE HAS 
LABOUR M. P.'S AND HE HOPES IT IS LESS 
DAMAGING THAN IF HE HAD BEEN 
DEFEATED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
OR IF LABOUR M. P.'S AND ACTIVISTS WERE 
FORCED TO GO ON THE DOORSTEPS WITH 
NOTHING TO SAY TO THE VOTERS WHO 
SAY I'M LOSING OUT WHAT ARE YOU 
GOING TO DO ABOUT IT BEFORE THE 
CRUCIAL ELECTIONS THAT ARE BEING 
HELD NEXT WEEK OF COURSE IN THE 
LABOUR RANKS VOTERS CARE MUCH LESS 
WHAT THEY CALL FOR WHAT HAPPENED 
TODAY THOUGH WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE 
BANK BALANCE BUT A SIGN OF A LOSS 
OF AUTHORITY FOR GORDON BROWN 
REMAINS TONY BLAIR RETURNED FOR 
THE FIRST TIME TODAY HE WAS 
UNVEILING A PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF AND 
INSISTED THE CAMERAS WOULDN'T BE 
PRESENT AND HE WOULD SAY NOTHING 
RELEVANT TO TODAY'S NEWS BUT I AM 
TOLD BY PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE AT 
THAT UNVEILING THE MUTTERINGS OF 
TONY BLAIR WAS IT WOULDN'T HAVE 
HAPPENED UNDER HIM AND SHOULD WE 
BE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE ELSE WHO 
WOULD MAKE A BETTER LABOUR LEADER

THE SEARCH FOR JAMES CONTINUED AND 
DUE TO HIS SEVERE DISABILITIES 
THERE WERE CONCERNS FOR HIS WELFARE 
THIS EVENING WEST MERCIA POLICE

THE BODY 
WAS DISCOVERED THIS AFTERNOON AT A 
PROPERTY IN THE CHURCHILL AREA 
OFFICERS HAVE CORDONED OFF THE 
IMMEDIATE AREA A POSTMORTEM IS 
UNDER WAY TO ESTABLISH THE CAUSE OF 
DEATH AND ARRANGEMENTS ARE BEING 
MADE FOR FORMAL IDENTIFICATION TWO 
MEN HAVE BEEN ARRESTED BY OFFICERS 
ON SUSPICION OF THE MURDER OF JAMES 
HUGHES AND ARE CURRENTLY HELPING 
US WITH OUR INQUIRIES 
THE AREA 
SURROUNDING THE HOUSE IN CHURCHILL 
REMAINED CORDONED OFF AND 
NEIGHBOURS HAVE TOLD OF THEIR SHOCK 
IT WILL BE HARD FOR THE COMMUNITY 
TO COME TO TERMS WITH IT 
IT IS 
VERY DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN ISN'T IT 
AT THE END OF THE DAY NOBODY 
REALLY KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON 
TONIGHT THE TWO MEN ARRESTED ARE 
BEING QUESTIONED AT REDDITCH AND 
KIDDERMINSTER POLICE STATIONS A 
SATURDAY THIS WAS A STORY ABOUT 
THE MISSING MOTHER AND SON TONIGHT 
THE POLICE ARE DEALING WITH TWO 
DEBTS AND ARREST ON SUSPICION OF 
MURDER THEY ALWAYS SAID THERE WERE 
UNUSUAL ASPECTS TO THIS CASE AND 
THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS STILL TO 
BE ANSWERED 
THE JURY IN THE TRIAL OF THREE MEN 
ACCUSED OF HELPING SEVENTH JULY BOMBERS 
HAVE BEEN SHOWN SURVEILLANCE 
FOOTAGE OF ONE OF THE DEFENDANT 
WITH TWO OF THE BOMBERS THE 
FILMING TOOK PLACE IN THE SPRING OF 
TWO THOUSAND FOUR SIXTEEN MONTHS BEFORE THE SEVENTH JULY 
ATTACKS THE THREE MEN ON TRIAL 
WAHEED ALI SADEER SALEEM AND 
MOHAMMED SHAKIL FROM LEEDS DENY 
CONSPIRING TO CAUSE EXPLOSIONS 
HILLARY CLINTON'S HOPES OF SECURING 
THE NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT HAVE 
BEEN KEPT ALIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA 
WHERE SHE DEFEATED BARACK OBAMA BY 
TEN POINTS IT WAS CRUCIAL FOR 
SENATOR CLINTON SHE WAS EXPECTED 
TO BOW OUT IF SHE PERFORMED BADLY 
SUCCESS MEANS THE DECISIVE 
PRESIDENTIAL RACE GOES ON 
AMERICA KNEW THE CLINTONS WERE 
FIGHTERS BUT THIS IS SOMETHING 
ELSE THIS VICTORY WAS CRAFTED OUT 
OF BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS AND 
VICTORY SPEECH WAS CELEBRATION OF 
THAT AND EVERYTHING NOW HAS CHANGED 
HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA YOU MADE YOUR 
VOICE IS HEARD AND BECAUSE OF VIEW 
THE TIDE IS TURNING 
IF YOU HAD TO DISTIL THE CASE 
HILLARY CLINTON IS MAKING IT WOULD 
BE THIS THAT EVERYTHING STARTS 
AGAIN HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA THERE 
HAS BEEN AN EARTHQUAKE THE ENTIRE 
CAMPAIGN UP TO NOW IS IRRELEVANT 
AND IT GOES FROM HERE TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE HOUSE IT IS A MESSAGE SHE HAS BEEN 
REINFORCING TODAY PITCH WHICH 
TELLS THE PARTY OFFICIALS WHO WILL 
PROBABLY MAKE THE FINAL CHOICE YOU 
CANNOT AFFORD TO RISK GOING WITH 
BARACK 
I HAVE NO WAY OF 
PREDICTING WHAT THEY WILL DECIDE 
BUT I THINK LAST NIGHT WHEN IT 
SHOULD GIVE FRESH INFORMATION TO 
OUR SUPER DELEGATE BECAUSE AFTER 
ALL THE ROAD TO PENNSYLVANIA 
AVENUE DOESN'T GO THROUGH 
PENNSYLVANIA THE BROAD BASE OF 
COALITION I PUT TOGETHER IS EXACTLY 
WHAT I NEED TO HAVE BEEN THERE FOR 
BARACK OBAMA'S CASE IS THAT EITHER 
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE WILL WIN IN 
NOVEMBER HE SAID THE HUNGER FOR 
CHANGE WILL KEEP THE PARTY FAITHFUL 
FACE FALLS 
THEY WILL SEE THE 
CHOICE BETWEEN JOHN MCCAIN AND THE 
DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE AND SAY TO 
THEMSELVES THIS IS A CLEAR CHOICE 
DOES THE CLINTON ELECTABILITY CASE 
MAKE ANY SENSE LOOK AT SOME KEY 
STATES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA OHIO AND 
DE MEXICO WHERE THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS LIKELY TO 
BE WON OR LOST THE SUGGESTION A 
FIGHT BETWEEN BARACK OBAMA AND JOHN 
MCCAIN PENNSYLVANIA GOING EITHER 
WAY A HIGHER GOING EITHER WAY AND 
BARACK OBAMA WINNING NEW MEXICO 
THIS IS SPECULATION BUT IT IS 
SUGGESTING BARACK OBAMA HAS WORK TO 
DO 
I THINK THIS NOMINATION PROCESS DO HAS A WAYS TO GO WE HAVE INDIANA 
AND NORTH CAROLINA BARACK OBAMA 
HAS A CHANCE TO END THIS THING BY 
GETTING A DECISIVE VICTORY BUT HE 
HAS FAILED TO DO SO 
WHAT IS JAYNE 
JUST JOHN MCCAIN DOING HE HAS 
BEEN IN OHIO TOURING FACTORIES 
BUILDING SUPPORT AND TESTING PHOTO 
OPPORTUNITIES HE MIGHT WANT TO 
AVOID IN THE FUTURE JOHN MCCAIN IS 
CAMPAIGNING WHILE THE DEMOCRATS 
FIGHT FIGHT COMING UP ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME 
BARCELONA DISH OUT THE PUNISHMENT 
TO MANCHESTER UNITED IN THE FIRST 
LEG OF THEIR CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI 
FINAL 
A BUILDER WHO WAS LEFT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND OUT 
OF POCKET BY A CUSTOMER HAS 
DESCRIBED HOW HE TOOK DRASTIC 
ACTION WHEN HE DID NOT GET PAID 
NIGEL GRAY HELPED BY A COUPLE OF 
COLLEAGUES TOOK A SLEDGEHAMMER TO 
HIS WORK AT THE HOUSE IN WEST 
SUSSEX SUSSEX THE BRAND NEW PORSCHE AND 
CONSERVATORY AT NUMBER NINE 
ELIZABETH ROAD THEIR OWNER 
COUNCIL HOUSE TENANTS AND THE MAN 
WHO BUILT THEM NIGEL GRAY NIGEL 
GRAY A TRADESMAN QUOTED FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
FOR THE JOB BUT THE DAY HE SENT 
HIS BILL THINGS STARTED TO GO 
WRONG 
I HAD UNCLE KEITH TO DEAL WRONG WITH ALL THESE FAMILIES WHO WOULD 
BE PAYING MONEY FROM AMERICA INTO 
MY ACCOUNT NOTHING MATERIALISED 
EVENTUALLY WITH THE COUNCIL'S 
BLESSING HE DECIDED HE HAD NO 
OPTION IF HE HAD NO MONEY THEN HE 
WOULD RECLAIM HIS IMPROVEMENTS 
I DECIDED TO GO TO THE COUNCIL 
BECAUSE SHE IS A COUNCIL TENANT 
THE COUNCIL SAID THEY CANNOT PAY IT 
BUT THEY CAN ASSIST ME IN TAKING IT 
DOWN 
SO HE DID BRICK BY BRICK DOWN THE LADY WAS NOT WILLING TO PUT HER 
SIDE OF THE STORY THE COUNCIL TOLD 
US ANY TENANT CAN MAKE IMPROVEMENTS 
BUT IN THIS CASE A PRIVATE 
ARRANGEMENT HAD GONE WRONG SHE IS 
LIKELY TO HAVE TO PART WITH SOME 
CASH THE COUNCIL HAS TOLD HER SHE 
MUST PAY FOR THE HOUSE TO BE PUT 
BACK HOW IT WAS 
TALKS TO AVERT A STRIKE AT THE 
GRANGE MOUNT OR REFINERY IN 
EDINBURGH HAVE BROKEN DOWN THE 
UNITE UNION SAID A STRIKE BY TWELVE HUNDRED 
WORKERS WILL GO AHEAD ON SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY IT WILL THREATEN FUEL 
SURPRISE IN THE SUPPLIES IN 
SCOTLAND AND THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
THE UNION HAS OBJECTED TO CHANGES 
TO THE COMPANY PENSION SCHEME 
TWO MEN HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH THE 
MURDER OF DANIEL MORGAN A PRIVATE 
DETECTIVE WHO WAS FOUND WITH AN AXE 
IN HIS HEAD TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO A THIRD 
MAN A FORMER DETECTIVE HAS BEEN 
CHARGED WITH PERVERTING THE COURSE 
OF JUSTICE 
A NATIONAL TEACHERS' STRIKE 
TOMORROW THE FIRST FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS 
WILL DIS CAUSED MORE DISRUPTION 
THAN WAS FIRST EXPECTED A B. B. C. 
SURVEY HAS FOUND EIGHT HUNDRED SCHOOLS WILL 
BE AFFECTED MANY CLOSING 
ALTOGETHER THAT IS NEARLY A THIRD 
OF ALL SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND AND WALES 
FOR HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF 
PUPILS TOMORROW SCHOOL WILL BE OUT 
TAKE ONE OF THOSE 
TEACHERS ARE 
ON STRIKE OVER PAY FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN TWO DECADES PARENTS FORCED 
TO MAKE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS 
IT IS 
QUITE HARD TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS 
AROUND IT THEY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN 
US TIME IN ADVANCE AS WELL 
I AM A 
WORKING PARENTS AND I TOTALLY 
SUPPORT THE ACTION OF THE TEACHERS 
IN FEELING THEY HAVE TO TAKE 
IT IS 
TWENTY ONE YEARS SINCE THE NATIONAL UNION 
OF TEACHERS LAST STAGED A 
NATIONWIDE STRIKE WHY NOW THIS 
TEACHER ADMITS HER PAY HAS RISEN 
SIGNIFICANTLY BUT FEARS THE 
CURRENT OFFER JUST OVER TWENTY FIVE PER CENT 
WON'T KEEP PACE WITH INFLATION WE WE HAVE HIGHER MORTGAGE COSTS THAT IF 
YOU ARE LUCKY TO HAVE A MORTGAGE 
WE HAVE HIGHER FOOD BILLS AND HIGH 
TRANSPORT BILLS THOSE OF THE THREE 
MAIN THINGS THAT HAVE GONE BEYOND 
INFLATION OVER AND ABOVE THE 
NORMAL DAY TO DAY LIVING IT IS 
IMPORTANT FOR US TO STRIKE HOW HOW DOES TEACHER'S PAY COMPARE OVER TEN 
YEARS THEIR STARTING SALARY HAS 
RISEN IN REAL TERMS BY NINE P. SEVEN PER CENT THAT 
IS BETTER THAN A POLICE OFFICER 
BUT LESS THAN A NEWLY QUALIFIED 
NURSE POLITICIANS ON ALL SIDES SAY 
THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR A STRIKE 
THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR A 
STRIKE THAT HAS SO MUCH DAMAGE 
WHEN THE CASE FOR THAT STRIKE 
ACTION IS NOT MORE CLEARLY MADE 
AND WERE ALL OF THE OTHER TEACHING 
UNIONS ARE ACCEPTING THE PAY AWARD 
NOT EVERY SCHOOL WILL BE AFFECTED 
AS AROUND HALF OF TEACHERS AND 
UNIONS TO DO NOT SUPPORT THE STRIKE 
IF ONE IN FOUR SCHOOLS ARE FORCED 
TO CLOSE MANY PARENTS WILL BE 
INCONVENIENCED THE STRIKE MAY NOT 
BE THE END OF IT THE NUT IS 
REFUSING TO RULE OUT FURTHER ACTION 
LEAVING SCHOOLS FACING THE 
POSSIBILITY OF MORE DISRUPTION 
YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ON THIS STORY 
AND A LIST OF WHICH SCHOOLS WILL 
CLOSE ON THE B. B. C. WEBSITE 
THE NUMBER OF MORTGAGES APPROVED

OLYMPIC TORCH HAS ARRIVED IN THE 
AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL CANBERRA IT'S 
THE LATEST LEG OF ITS CONTROVERSIAL 
RELAY AROUND THE WORLD AND FURTHER 
DEMONSTRATIONS ARE EXPECTED TONIGHT

OVERSHADOWED BY THE INCREASINGLY 
CLOSE AND LUCRATIVE RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES WITH TWELVE 
BILLION PEOPLE CHINA'S THIRST FOR 
NATURAL RESOURCE ASSIST VAST AND 
PROVIDES A MASSIVE MARKET FOR 
AUSTRALIA'S MINING COMPANIES 
WE REPORT FROM WESTERN AUSTRALIA 
WITH YOU FIRST JAMES REYNOLDS IS IN 
BEIJING THE OLYMPICS DON'T BEGIN

CHEERING LIKE THE GAMES ARE ALREADY 
HERE THEY'VE COME TO WATCH THE END

FIRST MAJOR EVENT TO BE HELD AT 
CHINA'S NEW OLYMPIC STADIUM FORGET 
THE DRIZZLE YOU'RE MEANT TO BE 
DAZZLED THE STADIUM'S KNOWN AS THE 
BIRD'S NEST AND THERE IS A LOT OF 
AUSTRALIA IN IT SOME OF THIS 
JUMBLE OF STEEL WAS MADE FROM 
IMPORTED IRON ORE 
CHINA HAS HUGE AMBITIONS BUT 
HERE'S ITS PROBLEM IT DOESN'T HAVE 
ENOUGH RAW MATERIALS IN ITS OWN 
SOIL TO BUILD EVERYTHING THAT IT 
WANTS SO THIS COUNTRY HAS TO LOOK 
ABROAD AND AUSTRALIA ISN'T TOO FAR 
AWAY AWAY PART OF THE REASON AUSTRALIA WAS 
DUBBED THE LUCKY COUNTRY WAS NOT 
BECAUSE OF ITS BLUE SKIES OR GOLDEN 
BEACHES BUT THE GIANT HOLES CARVED 
FROM ITS LANDSCAPE WHERE ITS VAST 
MINERAL RESOURCES ARE MINED THE 
DEMAND FOR THEM FROM CHINA MEANS 
ITS LUCK IS SET TO CONTINUE 
THIS IS THE PILLBR U. IN WESTERN 
AUSTRALIA WHERE 
CHINA IS RIO TINTO'S BIGGEST 
CUSTOMER PRESENTLY DEVOURING RYEO 
TINTO IS DOUBLING ITS PRODUCTION 
AND RIGHT NOW A TRAINFUL OF IRON 
ORE LEAVES ONE MUCH ITS MINES EVERY 
SINGLE HOUR AND THE TRAINS ARE OVER 
A MILE LONG 
AUSTRALIA'S PRIME MINISTER KEVIN 
RUDD KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT CHINA IS 
HE USED TO LIVE HERE EARLIER 
THIS MONTH HE CAME BACK FOR AN 
OFFICIAL VISIT 
HE SPEAKS CHINESE 
HE EVEN DELIVERED A SPEECH IN PER 
PERFECT MANDARIN HERE IN BEIJING 
AUSTRALIA IS TRYING TO MAKE ITS OWN 
IMPRESSION AT THIS AUSTRALIAN 
RESTAURANT YOU CAN ORDER 
AUSTRALIAN STEAKS AND BEER AND WINE 
IN FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS' TIME IT'S 
LIKELY THAT CHINA WILL HAVE THE 
WORLD'S LARGEST MIDDLE CLASS THAT 
MEANS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF 
CHINESE PEOPLE WITH AN AWFUL LOT 
OF MONEY TO SPEND AUSTRALIA WANTS 
TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE 
PEOPLE SPEND THEIR MONEY ON 
AUSTRALIAN PRODUCTS 
SYDNEY UNIVERSITY AN INSTITUTION 
WHICH SPEAKS OF AUSTRALIA'S 
ALLEGIANCES OLD AND NEW ITS RECENT 
INNRUKS OF CHINESE STUDENTS HELPS 
KEEP IT AFLOAT AN EIGHTH MUCH ITS 
STUDENT BODY COMES FROM CHINA 
SO AUSTRALIA FACES A TRICKY AND 
EVERY MORE PRECARIOUS BALANCING ACT 
WEIGHING THE COMPETING DIPLOMATIC 
DEMAND MUCH ITS CLOSEST MILITARY 
ALLY AMERICA AND A COUNTRY 
THAT'S JUST BECOME ITS SINGLE 
LARGEST TRADING PARTNER CHINA 
SHIPS OFF WESTERN AUSTRALIA WAIT TO 
CARRY IRON ORE TO CHINA ITS GROWTH 
GIVES AUSTRALIA A MEASURE OF 
PROTECTION OVER THE GLOBAL SLOWDOWN 
TO WHAT EXTENT SHOULD AUSTRALIA 
FOLLOW ITS CONSCIENCE AND TO WHAT 
EXTENT SHOULD IT FOLLOW THE MONEY 
FOOTBALL NOW AND IN THE FIRST LEG 
OF THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE SEMI FINAL 
MANCHESTER UNITED FAILED TO SCORE 
AWAY TO BARCELONA AND THAT DESPITE 
A PENNELLIALITY IN THE FIRST FEW 
MINUTES MINUTES UNITED FANS LOVE THIS SOARING 
CATHEDRAL OF FOOTBALL IT'S WHERE

CHAMPIONS NINE YEARS AGO BUT 
HISTORY COUNTS FOR NOTHING 
INDIVIDUALS OFTEN DO AND THIS HAD 
BEEN BILLED AS MESSEY AGAINST 
RONALDO THE LATTER MADE A 
SENSATIONAL START NORMALLY NERVOUS 
AT SUCH MOMENTS STAGE FRIGHT 
PERHAPS GOT TO HIM WITH HIS STRICK 
GOING HARMLESSLY WIDE 
THOUGH BARCELONA DOMINATED FOR THE 
REST OF THE HALF UNITED DID HAVE A 
MORE AUTHENTIC PENALTY APPEALED 
TURNED DOWN THE REFEREE MIGHT BE 
IN FOR A BLAST FROM THE FERGUSON 
AIR DRIER THERE WAS THOUGH 
LITTLE TO GET THE UNITED MANAGER 
ANIMATED IN THE SECOND HALF WHAT 
FEW CHANCES THERE WERE FELL TO THE
