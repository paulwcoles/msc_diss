THIS IS JACKANORY JUNIOR 
HELLO I'M DON 
THIS IS A STORY FROM AFRICA 
ABOUT A CHEEKY LITTLE HARE CALLED MMUTLA 
DO YOU KNOW WHY HARES HAVE SUCH SHORT TAILS LET ME TELL YOU 
LONG LONG AGO MMUTLA LIVED IN A CAVE HALFWAY UP KOLOLO HILL 
ONE MORNING HE SET OFF SCRAMBLING OVER THE ROCKS 
DOWN INTO THE GREY GREEN BUSH AND THE LONG VELDT GRASS 
HE WAS HEADING TOWARDS THE WATERHOLE 
AND THOSE TENDER GREEN SHOOTS THAT SPROUTED NEAR THE WATER 
HE SHIVERED WITH DELIGHT 
NOTHING WAS AS TASTY AS THE SHOOTS SPRINKLED WITH FRESH MORNING DEW 
HE WAS LEAPING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL WHEN CREAK CRACK CRASH 
A MARULA TREE PLUNGED TOWARDS HIM SWOOSH 
IT ALMOST RIPPED OFF HIS NOSE AND THEN PINNED HIM DOWN 
TLOU THE ELEPHANT LOOMED OVER HIM 
TLOU SWIRLED HIS TRUNK SNAPPED OFF A BRANCH AS IF IT WERE A TWIG 
AND STUFFED THE SWEET SMELLING FRUIT INTO HIS MOUTH 
MMUTLA TRIED TO LOOK CALM ALTHOUGH HIS HEART WAS THROBBING 
GOOD MORNING TLOU HE BEGAN 
TLOU CHEWED AND CHOMPED BUT SAID NOTHING 
I SAID GOOD MORNING TLOU MMUTLA REPEATED A LITTLE LOUDER 
TLOU TWITCHED HIS TAIL BUT STILL SAID NOTHING 
I SAID GOOD MORNING TLOU MMUTLA SHOUTED 
WHAT DO YOU WANT PIPSQUEAK NO ONE INTERRUPTS MY BREAKFAST 
NO NEED TO BE RUDE TLOU 
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE BIGGEST YOU THINK YOU'RE THE STRONGEST 
IF WE HAD A TUG OF WAR I COULD BEAT YOU ANY DAY 
WELL TLOU WAS SO SURPRISED 
THAT WITH ONE MIGHTY SWEEP HE LIFTED UP THE MARULA TREE 
SO HE COULD SEE MMUTLA MORE CLEARLY 
YOU YOU PIPSQUEAK PAWWWW TLOU BLEW OUT A TRUNKFUL OF AIR 
IT WOULD HAVE BLOWN MMUTLA SKY HIGH IF HE HADN'T JUMPED ASIDE QUICKLY 
TOMORROW MORNING WHEN SUN PEEPS OVER THE MOUNTAIN 
I'LL COME WITH A ROPE THEN YOU'LL SEE 
MMUTLA BOASTED 
WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER HE SCAMPERED TOWARDS THE WATERHOLE 
THERE HE FOUND KUBU THE HIPPO WITH HER EYES HALF CLOSED 
BATHING IN THE WATER 
GOOD MORNING KUBU HE BEGAN 
KUBU STARED AT MMUTLA AND SAID NOTHING 
I SAID GOOD MORNING KUBU MMUTLA REPEATED A LITTLE LOUDER 
KUBU OPENED HER MOUTH SO WIDE THAT MMUTLA COULD SEE PAST ALL HER TEETH 
DOWN INTO THE GREAT CAVE OF HER THROAT 
WHEN SHE COMPLETED HER YAWN SHE BOOMED 
WHAT DO YOU WANT PIPSQUEAK NO ONE INTERRUPTS MY MORNING NAP 
NO NEED TO BE RUDE KUBU 
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE BIGGEST YOU THINK YOU'RE THE STRONGEST 
IF WE HAD A TUG OF WAR I COULD BEAT YOU ANY DAY 
YOU YOU PIPSQUEAK PAWWW THE HIPPO SPLUTTERED A MOUTHFUL OF WATER 
TOMORROW MORNING WHEN SUN PEEPS OVER THE MOUNTAIN 
I'LL COME WITH A ROPE THEN YOU'LL SEE MMUTLA BOASTED 
WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER HE SCURRIED AWAY 
ALL DAY MMUTLA WORKED HARD MAKING AN EXTRA LONG EXTRA STRONG ROPE 
NEXT MORNING THE HARE WAS LEAPING DOWN KOLOLO HILL 
THE LONG STRONG ROPE WAS HUNG OVER ONE SHOULDER 
SURE ENOUGH TLOU THE ELEPHANT WAS THERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL 
HE PRETENDED TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF MMUTLA AND CARRIED ON MUNCHING 
GOOD MORNING TLOU I BROUGHT THE ROPE 
MMM PHHH SAID TLOU 
MMUTLA SKIPPED UP CLOSE HE HELD OUT ONE END OF THE ROPE 
YOU TAKE THIS I'LL TAKE THE OTHER END AND RUN OVER THERE 
HE POINTED TO SOME VERY THICK BUSHES 
WHEN I'M READY TO PULL YOU'LL HEAR ME WHISTLE LIKE THIS WHEE WHEE 
MMUTLA WHISTLED SOFTLY THEN HELD HIS BREATH 
UNTIL TLOU BEGAN TO WIND THE ROPE ROUND HIS SINGLE TUSK AND HIS TRUNK 
QUICK AS A RIVERBANK FLY MMUTLA HOPPED TOWARDS THE BUSHES 
CALLING BACK TO TLOU 
YOU'LL SOON SEE THAT I'M STRONGER 
BUT MMUTLA DID NOT STOP AT THE BUSHES 
HE STILL HAD MORE ROPE AS HE BOUNDED DOWN TO THE WATERHOLE 
KUBU THE HIPPO PRETENDED TO TAKE NO NOTICE AND SANK BENEATH THE WATER 
MMUTLA WAITED FOR HER EYES TO RISE GOOD MORNING KUBU 
I BROUGHT THE ROPE 
PWWRRR KUBU BLEW A SPRAY OF BUBBLES 
MMUTLA SKIPPED UP CLOSE HE HELD OUT THE END OF THE ROPE 
YOU TAKE THIS DO YOU SEE THOSE BUSHES 
I'VE LEFT THE OTHER END JUST BEHIND THEM 
I'LL RUN AND GET IT AND WHEN I'M READY TO PULL 
YOU'LL HEAR ME WHISTLE LIKE THIS WHEE WHEE MMUTLA WHISTLED SOFTLY 
THEN HELD HIS BREATH UNTIL KUBU CLUTCHED THE ROPE WITHIN HER JAWS 
QUICK AS A KLIPSPRINGER MMUTLA SKIPPED TO THE BUSHES 
AS SOON AS HE HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF WELL 
MMUTLA TOOK A DEEP DEEP BREATH AND WHISTLED 
THIS TIME FOR ALL HE WAS WORTH 
FROM EACH END HE COULD HEAR AS TLOU AND KUBU BEGAN TO PULL 
THEY PULLED AND TUGGED AND TUGGED AND PULLED 
FIRST TLOU WAS HUMPING AND THUMPING AND KUBU WAS SHAKING AND QUAKING 
THEN KUBU WAS HUMPING AND THUMPING AND TLOU WAS SHAKING AND QUAKING 
GREAT DROPS OF SWEAT POURED OFF TLOU ALMOST ENOUGH TO MAKE A RIVER 
WHILE KUBU SPLASHED ALMOST ENOUGH TO EMPTY THE WATERHOLE 
MMUTLA LAUGHED SO MUCH HE WAS NEARLY SICK 
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO LOOKED FUNNIER TLOU OR KUBU 
THE TUG OF WAR CONTINUED FROM SUN UP UNTIL SUN DOWN 
NEITHER TLOU NOR KUBU WANTED TO GIVE UP BECAUSE NEITHER WANTED TO LOSE 
WHAT COULD BE MORE TERRIBLE THAN TO BE BEATEN BY A HARE 
BUT JUST AS SUN GAVE WAY TO MOON 
TLOU THE ELEPHANT FELT HE COULD NOT GO ON FOR ANOTHER SECOND 
AND KUBU THE HIPPO ALSO FELT THAT SHE MUST GIVE UP 
AT THE VERY SAME MOMENT EACH OF THEM LET GO OF THE ROPE 
KUBU GASPED GREAT GULPS OF AIR AND COLLAPSED OUT OF SIGHT 
TLOU PANTED LIKE HE HAD NEVER PANTED BEFORE 
AND DRAGGED HIMSELF TO THE WATERHOLE 
KUBU SAW TLOU 
AND TLOU SAW KUBU 
AND IN AN INSTANT THEY KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED 
WERE YOU SNORTED TLOU 
WERE YOU SPLUTTERED KUBU 
WAS IT MMUTLA'S IMAGINATION THAT MADE HIM SEE STEAM 
RISING FROM BOTH ANIMALS 
TIME TO GO HE THOUGHT TIME TO GO AND GET SOME SUPPER 
MMUTLA SCAMPERED AWAY 
AS MOON TOOK HER TURN TO PEEK OVER LENONG MOUNTAIN 
NOT BEFORE HE LET OUT ONE LAST LONG LOUD WHEE WHEE 
WELL TLOU THE ELEPHANT AND KUBU THE HIPPO 
GOT OVER THEIR PUFFS AND PANTS SOON ENOUGH 
BUT THEY DID NOT GET OVER BEING RED IN THE FACE 
HOW DARE SUCH A LITTLE HARE 
TRICK SUCH IMPORTANT BIG CREATURES AS THEMSELVES 
THEY DECIDED THAT THE MATTER SHOULD BE TAKEN TO KING LION 
KING LION DECIDED THE MATTER SHOULD BE TAKEN TO A MEETING 
SO HE CALLED ONE EARLY THE VERY NEXT MORNING 
KING LION BROUGHT THE MEETING TO ORDER WITH THREE DEEP GRUNTS 
RRR RRR RRR WHERE IS TSWHENE TELL HIM TO COME HERE IMMEDIATELY 
TSWHENE THE BABOON WAS KING LION'S CHIEF OF POLICE 
AMONGST THE SMALLER ANIMALS HE WAS KNOWN FOR THIS BITE AND HIS BARK 
HOWEVER WHEN HE STRUTTED INTO THE MEETING OF BIG ANIMALS 
HE NODDED LEFT AND RIGHT BEFORE HE BOWED IN FRONT OF THE ENORMOUS ROCK 
KING LION GAVE HIS ORDERS MMUTLA THE HARE WAS TO BE CAPTURED 
AND TRANSPORTED TO THE VERY TOP OF LENONG MOUNTAIN 
THE BIG ANIMALS ALL NODDED WITH APPROVAL 
WE COMMAND YOU CHIEF OF POLICE KING LION GROWLED 
TO STAND ON THE VERY HIGHEST CLIFF 
AND SWING THAT CHEEKY HARE ROUND YOUR HEAD TWELVE TIMES 
ONCE FOR EACH HOUR THAT HE MADE A FOOL OF TLOU AND KUBU 
SWING HIM SLOWLY SO HE CAN SEE HOW FAR HE WILL BE GOING DO IT 
WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON 
MMUTLA WAS SOUND ASLEEP UNDER A TREE 
OUTSIDE HIS CAVE HALFWAY UP KOLOLO HILL 
HE WAS DREAMING OF TUGS OF WAR WHEN A SHARP TUG AT HIS FOOT 
BROUGHT HIM TO HIS SENSES 
TOO LATE HE WOKE TO FIND HIMSELF HANGING OVER THE SHOULDER 
OF KING LION'S CHIEF OF POLICE 
IT WAS USELESS TO PLEAD OR TO ASK WHERE HE WAS BEING TAKEN 
TSWHENE THE BABOON WAS CLEARLY ON DUTY 
OTHERWISE WOULDN'T HE HAVE LOVED 
TO GET THOSE SHARP BABOON TEETH STUCK INTO HIM 
MMUTLA SHIVERED IF HE WASN'T CAREFUL TSWHENE MIGHT TAKE A BITE 
AND THEN TELL KING LION THAT MMUTLA HAD STRUGGLED TO ESCAPE 
MMUTLA KNEW HE HAD VERY LITTLE TIME 
EVEN ON THREE LEGS TSWHENE LEAPED FROM ROCK TO ROCK 
AS NIMBLY AS A KLIPSPRINGER 
MMUTLA BUMPED AND BOUNCED AGAINST THE BABOON'S BACK 
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME FIGS TSWHENE MMUTLA CALLED OUT 
BABOONS LOVED ROCK FIGS BUT TSWHENE DIDN'T REPLY 
I CAN SHOW YOU THE JUICIEST MMUTLA TRIED AGAIN 
TSWHENE REPLIED WITH A FIERCE BARK MMUTLA DIDN'T LIKE THE SOUND AT ALL 
THEY WERE BOUNDING THROUGH THE BUSH 
HANGING UPSIDE DOWN MMUTLA SAW MOSTLY THE TOPS OF TREES 
A GROUP OF BABBLER BIRDS BURST OUT CRAZILY INTO FLIGHT 
KWEE KWI KWI KWEE KWEE KWI KWI KWEE 
MMUTLA WAS NOW BEGINNING TO FEEL REALLY SCARED 
HE COULD FEEL THEY WERE GOING UPWARDS UP LENONG MOUNTAIN 
A SMALL SPECK CIRCLED HIGH ABOVE THEM 
WAS IT HIS OLD ENEMY NTSU THE EAGLE 
THE SPECK GOT BIGGER AND MMUTLA RECOGNISED 
NTSU'S COUSIN LENONG THE VULTURE NOT MUCH TIME LEFT 
OH TSWHENE I MUST THANK YOU HE SHOUTED 
THE BABOON SLOWED DOWN A LITTLE 
YES I MUST THANK YOU A LOT 
THEY SLOWED DOWN A LITTLE MORE 
THE CHIEF OF POLICE SEEMED TO BE THINKING 
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO THANK ME FOR HE BARKED GRUFFLY 
FOR NOT CARRYING ME BY MY TAIL 
MMUTLA'S TAIL HAD BEEN SWINGING WILDLY THROUGHOUT THE JOURNEY 
TSWHENE STOPPED HE DANGLED MMUTLA IN FRONT OF HIM 
WHY HE DEMANDED PULLING BACK HIS LIPS TO SHOW MMUTLA HIS LONG TEETH 
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I KEEP MY PRIDE 
A HARE'S TAIL IS HIS PRIDE AND JOY 
MMUTLA SPOKE SINCERELY ALTHOUGH THAT WAS NOT EASY WHEN UPSIDE DOWN 
IF YOU HUNG ME BY MY TAIL THEN EVERYONE WOULD LAUGH AT ME 
SO THANK YOU I'M READY TO DIE NOW BECAUSE I STILL HAVE MY PRIDE 
TSWHENE LOOKED SUSPICIOUS 
MMUTLA WAS WELL KNOWN FOR HIS TRICKS 
IF IT WAS TRUE THAT THE WORST WAY TO CARRY A HARE WAS BY HIS TAIL 
THAT WAS WHAT HE SHOULD DO SHOULDN'T HE 
WHY SHOULD HE ALLOW THIS HARE TO KEEP HIS PRIDE 
SO WITH HIS FREE PAW TSWHENE GRABBED MMUTLA'S TAIL 
OH I SHOULD NEVER HAVE TOLD YOU WAILED MMUTLA 
HIGHER AND HIGHER THEY CLIMBED TOWARDS THE TOP OF LENONG MOUNTAIN 
MMUTLA COULD SEE THE WATERHOLE FAR BELOW 
WERE THOSE TWO DARK BLOBS PERHAPS TLOU AND KUBU LAUGHING TOGETHER 
THEY WERE VERY NEAR THE TOP 
MMUTLA SAW THE WHOLE LENONG FAMILY LINED UP ON A BARE BRANCH 
THERE WAS HARDLY ANY TIME LEFT NOW 
MMUTLA TOOK A DEEP BREATH AND COUNTED TO HIMSELF 
THREE TWO ONE 
WITH AN ALMIGHTY LEAP HE SPRANG AWAY CRACK 
OFF CAME HIS TAIL IT HUNG FROM THE BABOON'S PAW 
MMUTLA DID NOT EVEN STOP TO ENJOY THE ASTONISHED LOOK 
ON THE CHIEF OF POLICE'S FACE 
HIS WOUNDED TAIL AND PRIDE WERE BOTH STINGING FAR TOO MUCH 
WITHOUT TURNING BACK ONCE HE HURTLED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN 
BUT THAT WASN'T THE END OF THE STORY 
MMUTLA SPENT THE REST OF THE DAY TELLING ALL THE OTHER HARES 
THAT THE BIG ANIMALS WERE GOING TO CATCH ANY HARE WITH A LONG TAIL 
AND SLING HIM OR HER OFF LENONG MOUNTAIN 
BE BRAVE DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR PRIDE 
BE LIKE ME AND GET RID OF YOUR TAILS 
AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT THEY DID 
OF COURSE MMUTLA'S TAIL AND THOSE OF THE OTHERS NEVER GREW AGAIN 
SO HE COULD NO LONGER TAKE PRIDE IN HIS LONG BUSHY TAIL 
HOWEVER AS TIME WENT BY 
HE WAS PROUD TO TELL THE LONG AND HAIRY TALE 
ABOUT WHY ALL HARES HAVE SHORT TAILS 
GOODBYE FOR NOW
