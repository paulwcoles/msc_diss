HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE ONE SHOW 
WITH ADRIAN CHILES AND CHRISTINE 
BLEAKLEY ON THE MENU TONIGHT A 
CONSIDERABLE HELPING OF MEATLOAF 
I LOVE YOU 
STEADY ON 
REALLY GOOD 
THING I'M NOT WEARING UNDERWEAR 
THAT'S THE HIGHLIGHT OF 
THE SHOW IT'S ALL DOWNHILL FROM 
HERE AND REVVING UP OUTSIDE IS 
FIFTH GEAR'S VICKI BUTLER HENDERSON 
SOME ROGUE PENSIONERS ARE GIVING 
THESE THINGS A BAD NAME 
THE RIGHT 
TO STRIKE IS A HARD WON PART OF OUR 
INDUSTRIAL HISTORY BUT THATCHER 
INCH AND A CHANGE IN UNION 
MEMBERSHIP SAW STRIKES DISAPPEAR 
BUT OIL WORKERS AND TEACHERS ARE 
TAKING TO THE PICKET LINES ARE WE 
HEADING FOR A WINTER OF 
DISCONTENT WE LOOK AT THE WINTER 
VERSIONS OF THIRTY YEARS AGO 
MASS PICKET LINES THREE DAY 
WORKING WEEKS AND ELECTRICITY 
BLACKOUTS IN NINETEEN SEVENTIES BRITAIN THE 
UNIONS HAD THE BALNESS OF POWER A 
TIME WITNESSED BY ONE FRESH FACED 
POWER 
THE MANAGEMENT HAVE REFUSE POWER TO DO TAKE PART IN TELEVISION 
INTERVIEWS AND SAY THE BOARD WOULD 
ONLY ALLOW AN INCREASE IN ONE HUNDRED NINETY A 
YEAR NOT THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THE MEN ARE 
DEMANDING 
O. K. I'VE CHANGED A LOT DEMANDING BUT SO HAS BRITAIN THE POLITICAL 
MOOD IS DIFFERENT AND PEOPLE'S 
ATTITUDES AREN'T WHAT THEY WERE 
THE NEVERTHELESS RECENT DISPUTES 
ILLUSTRATE THAT STRIKE ACTION CAN 
STILL MAKE A BIG IMPACT 
YOU CAN'T 
HAVE HUGE PICTING BECAUSE SOME OF 
THAT IS ILLEGAL BUT YOU CAN STILL 
HAVE COSTLY STRIKES THE RECENT 
GRANGEMOUTH DISPUTE IS ARGUABLY THE 
MOST EXPENSIVE INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE 
IN HISTORY SO WORKERS CAN STILL 
MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
IT'S FIVE THIRTY A M. 
JOHN CLARKE A COUNCIL WORKERS IS 
TODAY GOING ON STRIKE HE SAYS 
PROPOSED COUNCIL PAY REFORM REFORMS 
COULD SEE HIM LOSE A THIRD OF HIS 
INCOME 
I STAND TO LOSE SIX THOUSAND OUT INCOME OF MY WAGE I'M PRESENTLY EARNING 
IN THE REGION OF EIGHTEEN THOUSAND AND LIT GO 
DOWN TO AROUND TWELVE THOUSAND 
WITH HIS 
WIFE MICHELLE WHO IS REGISTERED 
DISABLED AND UNABLE TO WORK 
FINANCING ARE ALREADY TIGHT WHEN WHEN HE TAKES THAT SIX THOUSAND DROP WE'LL NOT 
BE ABLE TO AFFORD A LOT OF STUFF 
WE'LL GO ON TO THE POVERTY LINE 
WHICH WE ARE NEARLY AT NOW BUT 
WE'LL GO WELL BELOW IT 
LEEDS CITY 
COUNCIL SAYS THE UNION'S PAY 
DEMANDS ARE UNAFFORDABLE IN 
RESPONSE TODAY'S WALKOUT WILL SEE 
RUBBISH IN PARTS OF THE CITY LEFT 
UNCOLLECTED 
IS THAT FOR ME THIS UNCOLLECTED THIS IS FOR YOU 
ONLY TEN PER CENT OF WORKERS 
AFFECTED BY THE PAY DEAL ARE LIKELY 
TO LOSE OUT THE REST OF THE STAFF 
FACE A DIFFICULT DECISION WHETHER 
TO CROSS THE PICKET LINE 
UNBELIEVABLE 
I THINK PEOPLE WHO UNBELIEVABLE CROSS THE PICKET LINE ARE HEARTLESS 
BRAINLESS AND SCABS 
IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO WORK 
WITH THESE GUYS BECAUSE ANY 
BENEFITS THAT WE GET WILL BENEFIT 
THEM PEOPLE AS WELL NOT LIKE IN 
THE SEVENTIES OUT BROTHERS OUT WAS 
IN SCHOOL THEN 
SO WAS I ME FATHER 
WERE A MINER THOUGH 
WE CAN'T DO 
THINGS THE THEY DID IN THE SEVENTIES 
THERE ISN'T THE SAME FIGHTING ON 
THE PICKET LINES AND THAT'S A GOOD 
THING 
THIS STRIKE WILL HIT REFUSE THING COLLECTION IN ONE CITY BUT IN THE 
NINETEEN SEVENTIES UNION POWER COULD BRING THE 
WHOLE NATION GRINDING TO A HALT 
WE WANT ASSURANCES FROM THE CHAIRM 
OF THE GAS BOARD IN WRITING THAT 
ONLY PERMIT HOLDERS FROM THE N. U. M. TO 
DISTRIBUTE FUEL TO SCHOOLS AND 
HOSPITALS WILL GO THROUGH THESE 
GATES 
THE MINERS' UNION STRIKE OF GATES NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO LED TO ELECTRICITY BLACKOUTS 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY ONE OF THE 
RISING STAR IN THIS THE UNION WAS 
KEN CAPSTICK 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO MINERS GAINED 
CONFIDENCE BECAUSE THEY REALISED 
THEY A POWER THAT THEY DIDN'T 
REALISE THEY HAD 
FOR SOMEONE LIKE 
YOU A POWERFUL UNION LEADER WAS 
WAS IT LIKE CALLING PEOPLE OUT ON 
STRIKE 
FRIGHTENING BECAUSE YOU STRIKE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY 
YOU'RE GOING TO BE A VERY 
DIFFICULT POSITION YOU'RE GOING TO 
HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE FACING 
HARDSHIP DIVIDING FAMILIES A LOT 
OF STRESS YES 
BUT WE HAD A STRIKE YES TO WIN AND WE WERE DETERMINED THAT 
WE WERE GOING TO WIN IT AND IN 
NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO WE DID 
A DECADE LATER 
MARGARET THATCHER'S CONFLICT WITH 
THE MINERS WOULD BRITAIN AN END TO 
THEIR ERA OF DOM NAFPBLTS 
WE WOULD 
HAVE LOVED TO HAVE WON THAT STRIKE 
BECAUSE DOMINANCE YOU COULD HAVE 
GIVEN HER A BLOODY NOSE AND YOU 
WOULD HAVE ENJOYED THAT WOULDN'T 
YOU NO 
UNION MEMBERSHIP HAS 
HALVED SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE BUT WHITE BE 
WRONG TO ASSUME THEY'VE LOST ALL 
THEIR POLITICAL BITE 
I THINK 
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE WE'LL SEE 
INCREASING INDUSTRIAL UNREST 
PARTICULARLY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR 
GORDON BROWN SAYS HE ONLY WANTS TWO PER CENT 
PAY RISES IN THAT SECTOR BUT 
INFLATION IS RUNG ON HIS OWN 
ENERGYS AT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT SO YOU COULD SEE A 
SUMMER OF INDUSTRIAL UNREST ON A 
SCALE WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN A FEW 
YEARS 
STRIKE ACTION IN BRITAIN HAS YEARS RISEN SPREAD YIL IN THE LAST FEW 
YEARS AND IF STRIKES LIKE THIS ONE 
IN LEEDS ARE GIG TO GO BY THAT 
COULD CONTINUE 
PEOPLE WANT TO 
STAND UP TO MANAGEMENT AND NOT BE 
WALKED OVER THERE'S A STRONG 
FEELING OF COMRADERY AND A FEELING 
THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO STOP UNTIL 
WE GET WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR I I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD ASK MEATLOAF 
THIS QUESTION BUT ARE YOU MILITANT 
ARE YOU FOR STRIKE ACTION OR ARE 
YOU AGAINST IT 
I DON'T THINK 
STRIKES ARE REALLY A HEALTHY THING 
FOR THE PEOPLE ON STRIKE OR FOR 
THEIR PRODUCTS WHATEVER THEY'RE 
DOING OR BUILDING OR WORKING ON L. 
DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD BUT PING 
ALSO PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID WHAT IS 
THE RIGHT WAGE THE MANAGEMENT 
TENDS TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY WHEN 
THE WORKERS DON'T SO I THINK 
THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR A 
STRIKE WHEN YOU'RE NOT GETTING 
PROPER HEALTH CARE OR WAGES AND 
THE PRICE INCREASES GO UP THE 
ACTORS' STRIKE IN AMERICA THAT IS 
SUCH A SPLINTERED UNION THAT ALL 
THE PRODUCERS AND THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS 
ACTORS ALL HAD THEIR FILMS IN THE 
CAN AT THE MOMENT SO THEY DON'T 
CARE IF THERE'S A STRIKE THEY HAVE 
ENOUGH FILMS TO KEEP GOING BUT IN 
HOLLYWOOD THEY WERE AFRAID THE 
TATTOO ARTISTS WOULD GO ON STRIKE 
ONE OUT ALL OUT THE ONE SHOW'S 
CURIOUS CLINIC WE HAVE SYMPATHISED 
WITH THE WINDY THE ITCHY AND THE 
FLAT FOOTED TONIGHT SWEAT GETS THE 
TREATMENT AS DOCTOR DOCTOR SARAH JARVIS 
LOOKS AT THE PLIGHT OF A WOMAN WHO 
IS EXPIRING AT THE AMOUNT OF PERS 
PYRING SHE IS DOING 
PERSPIRING EVEN ON THE BREEZIEST 
OF DAYS MOST OF THESE JOGGER ALSO 
BE WORKING UP A HEALTHY STWET A 
MARATHON RUNNER CAN LOSE HALF 
STONE DURING RACE EACH OF US HAS 
TWO POINT FIVE MILLION SWEAT GLANDS IN OUR 
BODY AND OUR FEET ALONE PRODUCE 
PINT OF SWEAT A DAY IN FACT 
SCIENTISTS BELIEVE PERSPIRATION 
PLAYS BIG PART IN SEXUAL 
ATTRACTION THE MEREST WHIFF OF 
MALE SWEAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO SEND 
FEMALE HORMONES SOARING OUR SWEAT 
IS ODOUR FREE IT IS ONLY WHEN 
BACTERIA MULTIPLY IN IT IN OUR 
UNDERARMS FEET AND SCALPS THAT WE 
GET THAT PONG THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT 
PART OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM CAUSES 
US TO SWEAT LAURA KNOWS ABOUT THAT 
TERRIBLE CLAMMY FEELING WHEN UNDER 
THE SPOTLIGHT LAURA'S NOT JUST A 
VIEWER BUT PERFORM PER MEMBER 
OF OUR COMPLAINTS CHOIR 
PERFORMER 
AS A PERFORMING ARTIST IT IS 
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THAT LAURA 
APPEARS COOL CALM AND COLLECTED 
BUT LIKE ONE IN EVERY ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN 
THE U. K. SHE SUFFERS FROM CONDITION 
CALLED HYPER HIDE ROSE IS WHICH 
MEAN IT'S SWEAT GLANDS NOTICE PALMS 
OF HER HANDS AND SOLES OF HER FEET 
ARE IN PERMANENT OVERDRIVE SIMPLE 
THINGS LIKE BEING ABLE TO TURN A 
BRASS DOOR KNOB OR WRITE AN EXAM 
WHERE YOU ARE REALLY WHERE IT IS 
SUMMER AND YOU ARE STRESSED IT'S 
REALLY DIFFICULT GRIPPING THE PEN 
AND DAMAGING THE PAPER AS WELL HOW 
DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT AND BEING 
TACTILE WITH PEOPLE I'M TACTILE 
PERSON AND I'M NOT NERVOUS PEOPLE 
ASSUME THAT YOU ARE NERVOUS WHEN 
YOU ARE NOT AND BEING ABLE TO 
TOUCH PEOPLE AND HOLD THEIR HAND 
WEAR OPEN TOED SHOES OR GO BAREFOOT 
WHICH I WOULD DO ALL THE TIME BUT 
YOU CAN'T DO 
MANY PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM EXCESS 
SWEATING AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT IS 
AN ALUMINIUM BASED ANTI PERS PLANT 
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS THESE 
STRONG CHEMICALS COULD LEAK INTO 
THE UNDERARM OLYMPICS GLANDS AND 
CAUSE CANCER 
A NUMBER OF STUDIES 
HAVE COMPARED THE INCIDENCE OF 
BREAST CANCER WITH PATIENTS WHO 
USED ANTI PERS PLANTS AND THOSE WHO 
HAVEN'T AND THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC 
EVIDENCE THAT THIS CAUSES BREAST 
CANCER 
BUT NOT EVEN THE STRONGEST CANCER PRESCRIPTION ANTI PERS PLANTS WORK 
ON LAURA ONCE A WEEK SHE NOW GETS 
ED IN 
I'M PASSING A CURRENT 
THROUGH LAURA'S LEFT HAND UP HER 
LEFT ARM ACROSS HER CHEST AND OUT 
OF HER RIGHT ARM 
IT'S TINGLING AND 
IT FEELS ALMOST WARM JUST A VERY 
AIL SENSATION 
WOULD YOU DESCRIBE 
IT AS PINS AND NEEDLES ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY THIS TREATMENT HELPS ABOUT NINETY PER CENT OF 
PATIENTS AND CAN BE USED ON HANDS 
FEET AND UNDERARMS BUT ITS 
EFFECTIVENESS CONTINUES TO BAFFLE 
EVEN THE EXPERTS 
TO BE HONEST WE 
DON'T KNOW HOW THIS TREATMENT WORKS 
BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT IT 
DISTURBS THE NORMAL FUNCTION OF THE 
SWEAT GLAND WHILE YOU ARE HAVING 
THIS MILD ELECTRICAL CURRENT PASS 
THROUGH YOU AND THAT IN TURN 
BLOCKS THE SVELTE DUCTS TEMPORARILY 
YOU NEED TO HAVE TOP UP TREATMENTS 
EVERY SO OFTEN FOR SOME PEOPLE IT 
LAST AS WEEK OR SO FOR OTHERS IT 
LAST AS COUPLE OF MONTHS WHAT CAN 
YOU DO NOW THAT YOU COULDN'T 
BEFORE 
JUST SO MANY THINGS THAT BEFORE YOU WOULD TAKE FOR GRANT L. CAN 
TOUCH PEOPLE ON THE ARM L. CAN HOLD 
HANDS WITH PEOPLE L. CAN TOUCH MY 
FACE AND PUT MY MAKE UP ON WITHOUT 
IT BEING A PROBLEM SO MANY THING 
THAT IS EVERYDAY THINGS THAT WHY 
HAVE FOUND REALLY DIFFICULT BUT 
WITH IN I DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT 
ANY MORE BEFORE IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN LIKE A DARK CLOUD HANGING OVER 
EVERYTHING THAT I DID IT IS THE 
FREEDOM OF NOT WORRYING ABOUT IT 
DOCTOR SARAH AND WE HAVE A PATIENT FOR 
YOU DAVE OUR PROPS MAN SWEATY 
CHAP GENERALLY 
AFTER FINE MINUTES 
OF RUNNING 
AND HE IS A CRYSTAL 
PALACE FAN IS IT GENETIC HOW MUCH 
WE SWEAT 
TO AN EXTENT BEING 
OVERWEIGHT MEANS YOU TEND TO SWEAT 
MORE BUT WE AS HUMANS ARE 
BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED IF WE DIDN'T 
SWEAT WE WOULD HAVE TO DO WHAT DOGS 
DO CAN YOU IMAGINE US WITH OUR 
TONGUES HANGING OUT 
THERE ARE SOME 
ON OUR TEAM WITH THEIR TONGUES 
HAJJING OUT WHAT ARE THE SWEAT 
POINTS ON A TYPICAL MERE 
THIS IS 
THE NUMBER ONE SWEAT POINT WE HAVE 
MORE ON OTHER FEET 
THAT'S HOW 
LITTLE WE PAY OUR PROPS MEN AND AND NOT SURPRISING UNDERARMS A MAJOR 
CAUSE OF SWEAT THAT'S WHERE WE 
LOSE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE HANDS 
DON'T TEND TO SWEAT MUCH WHEN WE 
ARE HOT BUT WHEN WE ARE EXCITED OR 
NERVOUS WE SWEAT A LOT THERE 
THAT'S WHY LAURA SAID IF YOU GET 
SWEATY HANDS EVERYONE ASSUMES IS 
YOU ARE NERVOUS AND THE SCALP 
SOME PEOPLE JUST SWEAT A LOT FROM 
THEIR HEADS IN FACT BABIES LOSE A 
LOT OF BODY HEAT FROM THEIR HEADS 
ONE SOUND BIT OF ADVICE IS DON'T 
WEAR A BLUE SHIRT ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY DON'T WEAR A NYLON SHIRT AS WELL 
FOOTBALLERS' SHIRTS 
HAVE WE SEEN 
THE PHOTOGRAPH OF OUR FORMER 
LEADER I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S 
NYLON UNLESS HE IS SOMEWHERE ON 
THE EQUATOR 
THAT ISN'T A KIND 
PICTURE YOU NEED TO LET YOUR BODY 
BREATHE DON'T GET TOO HOT DON'T 
BE OVERWEIGHT AND YOU CAN OF 
COURSE WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT ANTI 
PERS PLANTS AND TODAY RANTS BUT 
BOTOX ONE OF THE POSITIVE USES FOR 
IT 
IF WE'RE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING TWELVE 
LITRES OF SWEAT A DAY YOU MUST GET 
RID OF THAT IN TWO MINUTES WHEN 
PERFORMING 
WHEN I WAS HEAVIER I PERFORMING WEIGHED ABOUT LIKE THOSE DAYS 
ABOUT EIGHTY POUNDS MORE ON ANY GIVEN 
SHOW I MIGHT LOSE AS MUCH AS SEVENTEEN 
POUNDS WOW 
FROM SWEATING THAT'S POUNDS WOW THAT'S A LOT ISN'T IT 
IT WAS YOU JUST 
DRINK IT RIGHT BACK THE MOST I 
EVER LOST I ACTUALLY WEIGHED 
MYSELF HI LOST TWENTY THREE POUNDS IN A SHOW 
IN FLORIDA 
YOU'RE LIKE A RACE 
HORSE WE CAN SEE YOU IN ALL YOUR 
SWEATY GLORY HERE ACTUALLY 
LIKE A BAT OUT OF HELL 
LIKE A BAT OUT OF HELL OH LIKE A BAT OUT OF HELL 
MUST BE BREATHING THROUGH YOUR EARS

CALCULATED YOU'VE PERFORMED THAT 
SONG SOMETHING LIKE NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO 
TIMES DO YOU DREAD THE FIRST BAR 
NO ACTUALLY WHEN I HEAR IT I 
ACTUALLY GET REALLY EXCITED BEHIND 
IT 
EVEN NOW REALLY AFTER NEARLY IT TEN THOUSAND TIMES

THIS IS IT I'M DONE GOODBYE L. 
SAID GOOD NIGHT 
AND YOU'RE BACK 
I WAS SCARED TO DEATH SO WE CAME 
BACK AND WE'RE MAKING IT MILD 
WE ALL KNOW ABOUT RED SQUIRRELS AND 
MOST OF US HAVE SEEN GREY SQUIRRELS 
IN THE GARDENS OF THIS SUBURBAN 
STREET LIVES SOMETHING A LOT MORE 
UNUSUAL EVER HEARD OF A BLACK 
SQUIRREL HELLO JOHN HI 
ANY SIGN HI OF IT YET 
NOT AS YET BUT WE LIVE 
IN HOPE 
SO JOHN YOU'VE GOT A 
BLACK SQUIRREL IN YOUR GARDEN YES YES WE HAVE HE COMES AND VISITS US 
MOST DAYS 
BUT NOT AT THE MOMENT 
HE'S NOT HERE AT THE MOMENT THAT'S 
THE PROBLEM 
DO YOU FEED IT 
WE DO 
WE HAVE BIRD PEANUTS AND HE'LL POP 
IN AND PICK THEM UP YES 
IT'S DONE 
WONDERS FOR YOUR GARDEN BIRD LIFE 
YOU HAVE ROBYNS SONG THRUSHES ALL 
SORTS OF BIRDS OUT THERE HAVE YOU 
GOT PROOF THAT IT EXISTS 
I HAVE A 
PHOTO FROM A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO 
THAT IS OUR MR. BLACK SQUIRREL THEY THEY ARE FANTASTIC DO YOU LIKE THEM I I DON'T REALLY KNOW THEY LOOK QUITE 
VICIOUS 
THAT ONE DOES KIND OF VICIOUS DEMONIC EYE THAT'S ABSOLUTELY 
TYPICAL YOU SHOW UP WITH A FILM 
CAMERA AND THERE'S NO SIGN OF THE 
ANIMAL I KNOW WHERE I MIGHT BE 
ABLE TO FIND THE ELUSIVE BLACK 
SQUIRREL LET'S SEE IF THE LOCALS 
HAVE ANY IDEA HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF 
THESE AROUND 
GREY SQUIRRELS THIS THIS IS A BLACK ONE HAVE YOU SEEN THEM 
BEFORE NO 
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF BEFORE NO THESE 
ONE IN THE CHURCH YARD HERE THESE HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF THESE 
IS THAT 
A GREY 
A BLACK ONE 
POSSIBLY IN 
THE CHURCH YARD 
HAVE YOU SEEN 
THESE AROUND 
BLACK SQUIRRELED 
EVERYWHERE 
ARE THEY DOES IT MAKE EVERYWHERE YOU PROUD 
I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR 
BUT I LIKE THEM 
THERE'S PROBABLY 
ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT THAT LIVE IN 
THIS CHURCH YARD 
O. K. SO I CAN SEE 
PIGEONS AND A SQUIRREL BUSHY TAIL 
BUT LOOKS PRETTY GREY 
TO ME YES A 
TYPICAL GREY SQUIRREL L. THINK I'M 
GOING TO NEED HELP TO FIND THE 
ELUSIVE BLACK VERSION SCIENTISTS 
HELEN MCROBIE HAS BEEN STUDYING 
THESE UNUSUAL CREATURES AND MIGHT 
BE ABLE TO SHED LIGHT ON THEM I I CAN SEE A DRAI UP THERE 
THEY DO EXIST A GENUINE BLACK 
SQUIRREL SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO 
MAKE THESE SQUIRRELS BLACK 
I WAS 
I WAS LOOKING AT THE GENE FOR FUR COLOUR 
AND COMPARING THE GREY TO THE 
BLACKS I FOUND THAT THE BLACK 
SQUIRRELED GOT FAR MORE MEL ANYONE 
IN ITS FUR SO IT MAKES IT DARKER 
THIS GENE FOR FUR COLOUR IS THE 
SAME GENE IN HULME A. N. S. WHICH MAKES 
YOU BLONDE AND ME A BRUNETTE 
HANG ON A MINUTE NOW THE SONG'S 
COME OUT THIS SQUIRREL HAS A GOOD 
DEAL OF BROWN IN ITS FUR TOO THE THE BROWNIE SQUIRREL IS ACTUALLY A 
CROSS BETWEEN THE BLACK SQUIRREL 
AND THE GREY SQUIRREL 
THAT'S WHAT 
WE'VE GOT HERE 
YES HE'S GOT A 
LOVELY BUSHY TAIL JUST LIKE THE 
GREY 
AND THAT'S NOT ALL THAT GREY SURPRISING BECAUSE WHETHER THEY'RE 
BLACK OR BROWN THESE ARE IN FACT 
THE VERY SAME SPECIES AS THE 
FAMILIAR GREY SQUIRREL WITH JUST 
THAT ONE SINGLE GENE MAKELING THEM 
MAKING THEM LOOK SO DIFFERENT 
AND THAT MIGHT ALSO EXPLAIN WHY 
BLACK SQUIRRELS ARE DOING RATHER 
WELL 
IT COULD BE THAT GENE IS WELL HAVING OTHER EFFECTS IN THE 
SQUIRREL IT MIGHT MAKE ITS IMMUNE 
SYSTEM BETTER IT MIGHT MAKE TEST 
TOFT RHONE IN ITS BLOOD WHICH 
COULD AFFECT ITS BEHAVIOUR IT 
COULD BE THAT BLACK SQUIRRELS ARE 
BETTER AT MATING OR MORE SUCCESSFUL 
AT FINDING MATES 
MORE ATTRACTIVE 
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT THE GREYS 
JUST AREN'T AS CUTE AS THE NEW KIDS 
ON THE BLOCK WHEN IT COMES TO THE 
LATEST IN SQUIRREL FASHION BLACK 
REALLY IS THE NEW BLACK 
I'M NOT SURE I LIKE THEM TO BE 
HONEST LET US KNOW IF YOU S. P. T. A 
BLACK SQUIRREL MEATLOAF YOU'RE 
PLAYING THE BRITISH MOTOR SHOW 
LONDON AUGUST SECOND 
I FOUND THAT OUT 
YESTERDAY 
DUE WE'LL KEEP YOU UP YESTERDAY TO DATE YOU'RE KNOWN FOR YOUR LOVE 
OF MOTORBIKES WHAT DO YOU THINK OF 
THESE THINGS 
YOU KNOW WHAT I 
ABSOLUTELY LOVE THOSE THINGS THERE 
WAS A WOMAN I USED TO LIVE IN WEST 
LAKE CALIFORNIA THERE WAS A WOMAN 
WHO ROAD HER SCOOTER BACK AND FORTH 
AND SHE HAD A HELMET AND GOGGLES 
AND A TEN FOOT POLE WITH A RACOON 
TAIL ON IT 
A GOOD ONE SHOW GUEST 
WE HAVE ABOUT A QUARTER OF A 
MILLION SCOOTERS ON OUR HIGH 
STREETS 
VICKI BUTLER HENDERSON STREETS POUNDED THE PAVEMENTS OF RUGBY TO 
TACKLE THE PROBLEM HEAD ON 
I'M USED TO DRIVING SOMETHING LIKE 
THIS AND THIS TODAY I'M LOOKING 
AT SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT 
SLOWER 
THE CITY OF RUGBY IN WARWICKSHIRE 
HAS BECOME SO OVERRUN WITH SCOOTERS 
IT HAS BEEN NICKNAMED SCOOTER CITY 
NOW THIS IS NOT A SEXY SUPERCAR 
BUT IT IS LIFE LINE FOR PEOPLE 
ARE DISABILITIES AND MOBILITY 
PROBLEMS DO NOT BE FOOLED THIS 
THING CAN RIP UP THE TARMAC THERE THERE WAS A BLOKE ON ONE AND HE WAS GOING 
TOO FAST AND I HAD TO MOVE MY 
DAUGHTER OR ELSE SHE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN KNOCKED DOWN 
THEY DON'T STOP 
EVEN WITH A PUSH CHAIR 
THEY DON'T 
PAP THE HORN THEY BARGE YOU OUT OF 
THE WAY 
DAVID FOSTER OF THE RUGBY 
DISABILITY FORUM CONTACTED THE 
POLICE ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF 
MOBILITY MENACES 
THERE ARE A ROGUE 
ELEMENT OF SCOOTER RIDE NERZ RUGBY 
THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF NEAR 
MISSES WE WANTED A JOINT APPROACH 
TO SLOW PEOPLE DOWN BEFORE THERE 
ARE ACCIDENTS 
ARE THERE ANY OTHER 
PROBLEM WAS MOBILITY SCOOTER 
DRIVERS 
THERE'S NO PROFICIENCY DRIVERS TESTING YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ANY 
FORM OF TUITION THE OTHER PROBLEM 
OF COURSE NONE OF THESE THINGS 
HAVE TO HAVE INSURANCE 
THE ONE 
WITH THE ALL WEATHER COVER DO YOU 
KNOW WHO IS DRIVING THAT THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS 
WOULD THEY 
SPEAK TO US 
I DOUBT IT 
WHY NOT 
BECAUSE HE'S RUDE 
THERE HAVE BEEN 
COMPLAINTS WITH REGARD TO THE SPEED 
OF MOBILITY SCOOTERS POLICE HAVE 
ISSUED THE STATEMENT OF STICKING TO 
FOUR M. P. H. BECAUSE OF PEDESTRIANS IN THE 
TOWN CENTRE 
THIS IS A PRIDE 
VICTORY FOUR IN MIDNIGHT BLUE IT 
IS A CLASS TWO SCOOTER WITH A TOP 
SPEED OF FOUR M. P. H. IT'S PRETTY SLOW AND 
UNLIKELY TO CAUSE TOO MUCH DAMAGE 
BUT IT'S THE FASTER EIGHT M. P. H. SCOOTERS 
THE CLASS THREE ONES DRIVING PEOPLE 
MAD 
THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED IN MAD THE TOWN CENTRE WITH THEM 
IT IS 
BAD THAT THEY'RE GOING TOO FAST 
WHAT'S THE MESSAGE FOR SPEED 
FREAKS 
DON'T GO ANY MORE THAN FOUR FREAKS YOU LOOK LIKE INNOCENT ENOUGH 
MACHINES HAVE YOU TO HAVE 
CERTAIN LEVEL OF SAFETY 
I THINK 
THE BASIC THING IS THAT IF YOU'RE 
RIDING ONE ON A PAVEMENT YOU HAVE 
TO KEEP TO PEDESTRIAN LEVELS KEEP 
IT SLOW 
COMMON SENSE ALL THE WAY 
SPEAKING OF COMMON SENSE WE HAVE 
TWO DUBIOUS RIDERS HERE FIRST UP
