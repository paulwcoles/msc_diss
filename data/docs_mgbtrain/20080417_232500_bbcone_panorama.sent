THE CREDIT CRUNCH IS GETTING PERSONAL 
YOU WAKE UP EVERY DAY FEELING WHAT IS THE NEXT BILL GOING TO BRING 
WHAT IS MY NEXT CRUNCH 
BASICALLY IT'S VERY HARD 
GOVERNMENTS WON'T LET BANKS GO BUST 
BUT WHO IS BAILING OUT THE REST OF US 
WE FELT SO LUCKY THAT WE WERE SO YOUNG 
AND MANAGED TO OWN OUR OWN HOUSE 
IF BRITAIN IS FORCED TO BREAK ITS ADDICTION TO CREDIT 
WHO ELSE WILL SUFFER AS THE SPENDING COMES TO AN END 
IF YOU ARE A SAVER WITH MONEY IN THE BANK 
YOU MAY BE FEELING RATHER SMUG RIGHT NOW 
FOR EVERYBODY ELSE IT'S A TIME TO ANXIOUSLY MONITOR THE BUSINESS NEWS 
AND SCRUTINISE THOSE BANK STATEMENTS LINE BY LINE 
MAYBE FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THE COST OF ALMOST EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE GOING UP EXCEPT THE PRICE OF PROPERTY 
MORTGAGES ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE FALLING BEHIND WITH THEIR PAYMENTS 
ADDED TO WHICH EVERY SINGLE DAY SEEMS TO BRING 
A NEW PIECE OF BAD NEWS FROM AMERICA WORRYING TIMES 
WE'VE BEEN PUMPING UP THE ECONOMY FOR A LONG LONG TIME 
FOR MANY OF US THESE HAVE BEEN GOLDEN YEARS 
WE HAVE FELT RICHER THANKS TO HIGHER EMPLOYMENT AND RISING HOUSE PRICES 
WE'VE HAD CHEAP EASY CREDIT AND LOW STABLE PRICES 
BUT NOW THE WIND IS CHANGING 
AND NOBODY CAN BE QUITE SURE EXACTLY WHERE WE'RE GOING 
CONTROLLING THE ECONOMY IS A LITTLE LIKE CONTROLLING ONE OF THESE 
THE BALLOON NEEDS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF HOT AIR 
THE ECONOMY NEEDS JUST THE AMOUNT RIGHT AMOUNT OF SPENDING AND BORROWING 
BUT THE DANGER IS WE MAY HAVE OVERDONE IT A BIT 
AND THERE'S A BIT TOO MUCH HOT AIR IN THE ECONOMIC BALLOON 
THAT MEANS DEBT AND LOTS OF IT 
OUR JOURNEY STARTS IN BRISTOL 
PEOPLE LIVING HERE HAVE MORE WEALTH THAN ANY ENGLISH CITY OUTSIDE LONDON 
FROM SEPTEMBER THEY WILL HAVE A NEW PLACE TO SPEND IT 
JUST DOWN BELOW IS A MASSIVE CENTRE FOR RETAIL LEISURE AND CITY CENTRE LIVING 
UNTIL NOW A SURE BLUEPRINT FOR SUCCESS 
SO WHERE ARE WE NOW WE'RE IN THE CENTRAL ATRIUM 
WHERE THE STREETS FROM THE NORTH AND SOUTH CONVERGE 
IS THIS THE HEART OF IT THIS IS THE HEART OF THE SCHEME YES 
CABOT CIRCUS HAS COST HALF A BILLION POUNDS MAKING IT ONE OF THE BIGGEST DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COUNTRY 
IT WILL BE THE UPMARKET END OF BROADMEAD THE CITY'S ELDERLY SHOPPING CENTRE 
WHICH IS ALSO GETTING A MAKEOVER 
OUR ECONOMY'S RELIED ON RETAIL TO KEEP THE WHEELS MOVING 
BUT WILL THIS CENTRE BE ENOUGH TO PULL IN WEALTHY SHOPPERS IN DIFFICULT TIMES 
BRISTOL LANGUISHES LOW DOWN IN THE RETAIL HIERARCHY AT THE MOMENT 
THE IDEA IS TO BRING IT BACK INTO THE TOP TEN 
IT SHOWS YOU HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE THAT IT'S GOING BE SUCCESSFUL 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE BET THE RANCH ON THIS AS A COMPANY 
WE'VE TREMENDOUS CONFIDENCE IN THIS 
BECAUSE BRISTOL HAS BEEN CHRONICALLY UNDER SHOPPED 
THE SUPPLY WHICH WAS HERE WAS THE WRONG SORT OF SUPPLY 
IN FACT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE RETAILERS THAT WE SIGNED UP TO COME IN HERE ARE TOTALLY NEW TO BRISTOL 
THERE MAY BE LOCAL REASONS WHY THEY'RE OPTIMISTIC THIS CENTRE WILL BE A SUCCESS 
BUT THE FACT IS LIKE OTHERS AROUND THE COUNTRY IT WAS PLANNED IN THE GOOD TIMES 
AND MAY OPEN IN BAD TIMES WHEN SPENDING ON CHEAP CREDIT CARDS WON'T BE SO EASY 
NICOLA HORLICK MANAGES SAVINGS AND INVESTMENTS SHE THINKS WE'VE BORROWED TOO MUCH 
IT'S CONSUMERS AND IT'S ALSO GOVERNMENTS WHICH ARE OVER INDEBTED 
IF YOU WANT A VERY HEALTHY LONG TERM ECONOMY 
THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A STRONG SAVINGS RATIO 
BUT IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE U. K. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAVING LESS AND LESS AND LESS 
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND CONSUMING TOO MUCH 
NO SAVINGS NO MORE CREDIT THAT LEAVES US WITH NO OPTION 
WE HAVE TO LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS 
THIS IS PAYBACK TIME AND IT'S GOING TO BE PAINFUL FOR EVERYONE 
BRONWYN CURTIS HAS WATCHED THE ECONOMY ON BEHALF OF COMPANIES AND BANKS FOR TWO DECADES 
MY CALL IS THERE WON'T BE A RECESSION 
BUT WHEN GROWTH SLOWS FROM OVER THREE PER CENT TO UNDER TWO PER CENT 
IT WILL FEEL LIKE A RECESSION TO A LOT OF PEOPLE 
WHAT WE SEE FIRST IS THAT SPENDING ON THE HIGH STREET STARTS TO SLOW DOWN 
WE SEE BUSINESSES INVESTING LESS THINKING ABOUT TIGHTENING THEIR BELTS 
NOT BEING ABLE TO PASS PRICES ON TO CONSUMERS 
AND THEN THEY START LAYING OFF PEOPLE 
SO THE CONSUMER PARTICULARLY BEING OVER BORROWED 
WILL START SPENDING LESS IN THE HIGH STREET 
AT CABOT CIRCUS THEY'RE RELYING ON ATTRACTING THE SORT OF CUSTOMER 
WEALTHY ENOUGH TO RIDE OUT THE STORM 
THE RETAILERS HAVE RESPONDED WELL TO THIS SCHEME BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY 
THEY KNOW IT'S A QUALITY OFFERING 
WHEN ANYBODY TALKS ABOUT A DOWNTURN OR A CORRECTION 
MY VIEW IS THERE IS ALWAYS A FLIGHT TO QUALITY 
BUT WITH THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE GOING INTO STORES FALLING FOR EIGHT MONTHS IN A ROW 
WHAT WILL IT MEAN FOR THESE SHOPS WHEN IT OPENS 
ONE HIGH CLASS RETAILER ALREADY SIGNED UP IS HARVEY NICHOLS 
ITS COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR IS PATRICK HANLY 
THERE IS A QUESTION OF TIMING 
ARE YOU CONFIDENT THIS THE RIGHT TIME TO OPEN A NEW STORE 
I SUPPOSE FIRST OF ALL WHEN YOU MAKE A DECISION TO MAKE A BIG INVESTMENT IN A NEW STORE 
YOU DO THAT FOR THE LONG TERM 
YOU ALSO MAKE THAT DECISION THREE YEARS IN ADVANCE SO YOU HOPE 
THAT THE CONDITIONS WHEN YOU OPEN WILL BE RIGHT 
IN FACT I THINK IN THE U. K. WE BELIEVE WE ARE NOT IN RECESSION 
WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE IN A PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY 
BUT I THINK WE ARE CAPABLE OF TRADING THROUGH 
A REASONABLY SEVERE DOWNTURN 
THE WORST PLACE TO BE RIGHT NOW IS THE MIDDLE MARKET 
WHERE STORES LIKE DEBENHAMS M. AND AMP S. AND WOOLWORTHS ARE REPORTING A DOWNTURN IN SALES 
AND OTHERS INCLUDING I. K. E. A. ARE PREDICTING A TOUGH YEAR 
THE PROBLEM IS WE'VE ALL GOT LESS AT THE END OF THE MONTH TO SPEND ON CLOTHES AND ENTERTAINMENT 
BECAUSE THE COST OF THINGS THAT AREN'T OPTIONAL ARE ALL GOING UP 
THE AVERAGE FAMILY FOOD BILL 
HAS GONE UP BY AROUND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY A YEAR 
ENERGY COSTS HAVE SOARED 
COUNCIL TAX IS RISING RAPIDLY 
AND PETROL IS UP MORE THAN NINETEEN P. A LITRE IN THE LAST YEAR 
ALL THESE THINGS ARE THINGS PEOPLE CAN'T AVOID 
THINGS YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR NECESSITIES 
AND DEALING WITH THESE DAY IN DAY OUT 
PEOPLE WILL FIND THEIR LIVING STANDARDS ARE POSSIBLY FALLING 
FOR THE EFFECT ALL OF THIS IS HAVING YOU NEED LOOK NO FURTHER 
THAN THOSE ACTUALLY BUILDING THE SHOPPING CENTRE 
ANDY ROBERTS WORKS HERE AS A CRANE DRIVER 
HE'S FINDING BALANCING THE BOOKS THE BIGGER CHALLENGE 
YOU HAVE THE COUNCIL TAX THAT'S GONE UP FORTY EIGHT POINT ONE THREE 
THE WATER RATES HAVE GONE UP ANOTHER THIRTY TWO 
THEY JUST SPRING IT STRAIGHT ON YOU 
YOU WAKE UP EVERY DAY THINKING WHAT WILL THE NEXT BILL BRING 
WHAT IS MY NEXT CRUNCH YOU'RE OUT THERE TRYING TO EARN A LIVING AND BASICALLY IT'S VERY HARD 
ANDY'S WAGES AREN'T RISING WITH INFLATION 
HE'S CHANGED FUEL SUPPLIER AND USES CALOR GAS IN A BID TO CUT COSTS BUT ISN'T SURE IT'LL MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE 
I WORK VERY HARD I DO SEVEN DAYS A WEEK 
WITH THESE BILLS MY WAGES ARE NOT COMING UP TO SCRATCH 
BRISTOL IS LUCKIER THAN MOST CITIES 
ITS ECONOMY IS DIVERSE AND IT STILL HAS MAJOR MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY BUT THAT'S ALSO FEELING THE PINCH 
THIS IS THE HOME OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST MAKER OF HOT AIR BALLOONS 
WHILE MORE PEOPLE ARE TAKING TO THE AIR FOR FUN 
ITS MOST IMPORTANT BUSINESS IS ADVERTISING 
THE FIRST THING THAT GETS HIT WHEN MONEY IS TIGHT IS ADVERTISING 
THESE BALLOONS ARE GREAT ADVERTISEMENTS 
BUT THEY COST QUITE A BIT OF MONEY SO THEY GET DEFERRED 
THE NUMBER OF VISUALS WE'RE BEING ASKED TO PRODUCE AND BALLOONS BEING ASKED TO QUOTE FOR THIS YEAR 
FOR PROMOTIONAL CORPORATE PURPOSES 
IS DOWN I THINK ABOUT SEVENTEEN PER CENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 
AND WHILE ORDERS ARE BEING CUT THE COST OF MATERIALS IS GOING UP 
A DOUBLE SQUEEZE 
KEEPING OUR PRICES DOWN IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS WE FACE 
BECAUSE ALL OF OUR COSTS ARE RISING OUR FABRIC IS OIL BASED 
WE USE A LOT OF METAL AND STAINLESS STEEL 
EVEN WOOD HAS GONE UP FIFTY PER CENT IN THE LAST YEAR 
WHAT IS YOUR READ ON THIS IS THIS JUST A BLIP AN ABERRATION 
OR ARE YOU IN FOR A TOUGH COUPLE OF YEARS 
I THINK WE ARE PROBABLY IN FOR AT LEAST A TOUGH YEAR 
IT'S GOING BE A DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT FOR EVERYONE 
THE ECONOMY WAS BEING HELD UP BY DEBT 
NOW CONSUMERS OWE MORE THAN A TRILLION POUNDS 
AND THE GOVERNMENT'S DEBT IS APPROACHING SIX HUNDRED TWENTY BILLION 
REDUCING THAT BORROWING IS A GOOD THING BUT CONTROLLING IT WELL THAT'S ANOTHER MATTER 
ANY BALLOONIST WILL TELL YOU THAT FLYING IS EASY COMING BACK DOWN AGAIN IS WHERE THE REAL SKILL LIES 
WHAT YOU WANT IS A NICE SOFT LANDING 
TAKE OUT TOO MUCH HOT AIR TOO QUICKLY AND YOU GET A CRASH 
AND YOU ALSO HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR THOSE TREACHEROUS CROSS WINDS YOU WEREN'T EXPECTING 
THE SLOWDOWN IN AMERICA'S HOUSING MARKET IS STARTING TO TAKE ITS TOLL 
ONE BIG MORTGAGE COMPANY THAT OFFERED EASY CREDIT 
IS STRUGGLING TO STAY OUT OF BANKRUPTCY 
THIS IS ONE REASON WHY WE HAVE LOST CONTROL OF OUR DESTINY 
WHAT STARTED AS POOR AMERICANS STRUGGLING TO REPAY THEIR HOME LOANS 
QUICKLY ESCALATED INTO A GLOBAL CRISIS THAT STOPPED LENDING BETWEEN BANKS 
THE FINANCIAL EQUIVALENT OF A HEART ATTACK 
THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNING ECONOMIST JOSEPH STIGLITZ HAD BEEN WARNING ABOUT THE RISKS FOR YEARS 
WHAT AMERICAN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WERE DOING WAS DANGEROUS 
IT WAS WORSE THAN MANY PEOPLE HAD EXPECTED 
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN PLENTY OF WARNINGS 
THAT AMERICA WAS WAITING FOR A FINANCIAL MELTDOWN 
NOW THEY'VE GOT ONE THE SUB PRIME MORTGAGES HAD BEEN MIXED WITH OTHER DEBT 
BANKS AROUND THE WORLD BOUGHT THE RIGHTS TO FUTURE REPAYMENTS AS INVESTMENTS 
BUT WHEN SOME HOMEOWNERS STOPPED REPAYING THE BANKS PANICKED 
THEY COULDN'T WORK OUT WHICH INVESTMENTS WERE STILL VALUABLE AND WHICH WERE WORTHLESS 
MANY PEOPLE WILL NOT UNDERSTAND HOW PROBLEMS WITH A FEW PEOPLE WITH THEIR MORTGAGES IN THE UNITED STATES 
LEADS TO AN ECONOMIC PROBLEM FOR SHOPPERS HERE ON THE STREETS IN BRITAIN 
WELL THERE IS A SQUEEZE IN CREDIT MARKETS 
ONE BANK DOESN'T WANT TO LEND TO ANOTHER BANK BECAUSE IT DOESN'T KNOW IF IT CAN REPAY THE MONEY 
AND IF YOU NEED MONEY YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET IT 
BUT EVEN IF YOU DON'T NEED MONEY THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO NEED MONEY 
IF THEY CAN'T BORROW THEY CAN'T SPEND 
IF THEY CAN'T SPEND THE ECONOMY GETS WEAKER 
TO BORROW A HANDY ADVERTISING METAPHOR 
THE WHOLE THING HAS CAUSED A CHAIN REACTION RIGHT AROUND THE WORLD 
CONFIDENCE PLUMMETS SHARES DROP MONEY BECOMES SCARCE 
AND NOW ALL OF US ARE FINDING IT HARDER TO GET A LOAN OR MORTGAGE 
BANKS ARE WITHDRAWING THEM AS FAST AS THEY ONCE OFFERED THEM THAT COULD PUSH DOWN HOUSE PRICES 
WITH TRUST GONE THE FEAR IS CONTAGIOUS 
NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW WHERE IT WILL END 
IF YOU ARE THE ONE LOOKING FOR A GOOD DEAL ON A CAR OR A HOUSE 
YOU COULD BE IN TROUBLE 
IN BRISTOL ANDY OUR CRANE DRIVER IS FEELING THE PAIN DIRECTLY 
HE IS TRYING TO RENEW HIS MORTGAGE 
I'M NOT HAPPY BASICALLY I TOOK THE MORTGAGE OUT AND BOUGHT A HOUSE THREE YEARS AGO 
AND I'M HOPING IT WOULD BE LESS AS THE YEARS WENT ON 
BUT I'M A BIT CONCERNED TO SEE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN 
SO YOU'LL CUT BACK ON SPENDING SOMEWHERE ELSE TO AFFORD THOSE HIGHER MORTGAGES EXACTLY 
I WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD LUXURY THINGS 
THE CHILDREN WILL HAVE TO GO WITH LESS THAN THEY'RE HAVING AT THE MOMENT 
DO YOU THINK THAT YOUR KIDS WILL END UP SHOPPING IN SOMEWHERE LIKE THIS WHEN IT'S DONE 
IF THE NAMES ARE HERE THEY WILL COME LOOKING 
WILL YOU TELL THEM THEY'LL HAVE LESS TO SPEND IF YOU HAVE TO PAY MORE ON YOUR MORTGAGE 
HOW DO YOU TELL A CHILD YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT IT'S AWKWARD BUT IF IT'S NOT THERE THEY CAN'T HAVE IT 
ANDY'S PROBLEM IS DUE TO A LACK OF MONEY IN THE BANKING SYSTEM 
BANKS' UNWILLINGNESS TO LEND TO EACH OTHER HAS PUSHED UP THE COST OF LENDING TO US 
OVER FIFTEEN MILLION HOMEOWNERS HAVE CHEAP DEALS THAT RUN OUT THIS YEAR 
WITH SOME MORTGAGES RISING BY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EVERY MONTH SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE 
CUTBACKS A LOT OF CUTBACKS 
WE'VE GOT A HOLIDAY COMING UP VERY SOON 
I'VE PAID FOR THE FLIGHTS BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT CANCELLING COS WE CAN'T AFFORD THE REST OF THE HOLIDAY 
THERE'LL BE NO SPENDING MONEY WHAT'S A HOLIDAY WITHOUT SPENDING MONEY 
BRONWYN HOW CAN THIS BE RESOLVED 
THERE IS NO QUICK FIX EVEN WHEN THE BANK OF ENGLAND CUTS RATES 
THE BANKS THEMSELVES ARE NOT CUTTING RATES TO THE BORROWERS 
AND IF THAT CONTINUES FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME 
WE MAY END UP HAVING TO HAVE SOME SORT OF RESCUE 
AND THAT WILL HAVE TO BE PAID FOR BY THE TAXPAYER LOOKING FORWARD 
WHILE ALL OF THIS IS GOING ON WHAT HAPPENS TO HOMEOWNERS OF COURSE 
BORROWING COSTS STAY HIGH HOUSE PRICES ARE FALLING 
AND THOSE WHO GOT ON THE HOUSING LADDER LAST ARE MOST EXPOSED 
DADDY YEAH WHAT'S THAT IT'S AN AIR FILTER FOR THE CAR BOY GOT TO MAKE SURE IT'S NICE AND CLEAN 
FRANCOIS TALJAARD IS FEELING THE PERSONAL PAIN OF THE GLOBAL CREDIT SQUEEZE 
HE AND HIS FAMILY MOVED TO BRISTOL FROM SOUTH AFRICA FIVE YEARS AGO 
HELLO BIG BOY HELLO HELLO 
THEIR SON FRANCOIS JUNIOR IS BRISTOL BORN AND BRED 
LIKE MILLIONS OF US THE COUPLE WORK FULL TIME TO BUY THEIR OWN HOME 
WHEN YOU BOUGHT THE HOUSE IT WAS A BIT OF A STRETCH BUT YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD AFFORD IT 
YES WE HAD DONE THE SUMS FOR IT 
WE SAT DOWN WORKED IT ALL OUT 
AND WE KNEW WE COULD AFFORD IT 
THEIR MORTGAGE WAS ALMOST ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY 
WHICH DID NOT LEAVE THEM MUCH WRIGGLE ROOM IF THINGS WENT WRONG 
UNFORTUNATELY I ENDED UP BEING ILL AND I WAS OFF WORK FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS 
THAT WAS JUST ENOUGH TO PUSH US OVER THE EDGE 
JUST THAT ONE THING JUST THAT ONE THING 
DETERMINED NOT TO MISS A MORTGAGE PAYMENT THEY USED CREDIT CARDS TO PAY FOR OTHER HOUSEHOLD BILLS 
AT THAT TIME WAS IT EASY TO GET CREDIT VERY EASY 
WHEN WE ORIGINALLY STARTED WITH A CREDIT CARD SORT OF THING 
IT WAS JUST BASICALLY FOR THOSE LITTLE THINGS 
WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO PAY OFF WITHIN A MONTH 
BUT THEN OF COURSE WHEN FRANCOIS WAS OFF WORK FOR A WHILE 
UM IT JUST GOT HARDER AND HARDER TO PAY IT BACK 
AND VERY QUICKLY IT TURNED VERY UGLY 
THE TALJAARDS AREN'T THE ONLY ONES BORROWING FROM PETER TO PAY PAUL 
IN FEBRUARY ALONE WE PUT TWO POINT FOUR BILLION ON OUR CREDIT CARDS AND OVERDRAFTS AS COSTS RISE 
BUT IF YOU PAY FOR ESSENTIALS ON CREDIT EVERY MONTH YOU'RE IN TROUBLE 
IT WAS THE LITTLE THINGS THE COST OF LIVING THE BUS FARES PETROL PRICES KEPT ON RISING 
THE COUPLE DECIDED TO SELL THEIR HOME TO CLEAR THEIR DEBTS AND THE MORTGAGE 
BUT THEN THE CREDIT CRUNCH HIT HOME 
UNFORTUNATELY THE MORTGAGE RATES HAVE GONE UP SO MUCH 
THAT YOUNG BUYERS AREN'T INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT THE MOMENT 
AND THE AREA WE LIVE IN IS VERY MUCH FIRST TIME BUYER AREA 
SO IN THIS AREA THE PROPERTY BUBBLE 
IT POPPED 
YEAH 
THE MORE THEIR HOUSE FALLS IN VALUE 
THE SMALLER THE CHANCE OF PAYING BACK THEIR LOANS 
IF THINGS GET WORSE THEY COULD FACE INSOLVENCY OR REPOSSESSION 
MORE THAN TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FAMILIES LOST THEIR HOMES LAST YEAR 
AND THAT FIGURE IS CERTAIN TO RISE 
IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE WE'VE FAILED 
I MEAN WE CAME HERE HOPING FOR A BETTER FUTURE 
AND WE FELT SO LUCKY THAT WE WERE SO YOUNG 
AND MANAGED TO OWN OUR OWN HOUSE 
AS MANY AS SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND FAMILIES RISK BEING TRAPPED BY NEGATIVE EQUITY 
AS THE VALUE OF THEIR HOME SINKS BELOW THEIR MORTGAGE 
JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM CABOT CIRCUS SHOPPING CENTRE IN THIS CHURCH 
IS A CIRCUS OF A DIFFERENT KIND 
THE FEAR HERE IS THAT A DOWNTURN COULD LEAD TO CUTS IN PUBLIC SPENDING WHICH WOULD AFFECT ITS GRANTS 
THESE ARE ANXIOUS TIMES FOR MANAGER JOANNA CROWSON 
WHO HAS ALSO GOT PROBLEMS MUCH CLOSER TO HOME 
I NEED A ONE HUNDRED PER CENT MORTGAGE 
THE PROBLEM IS THERE IS A CHARGE OF FIVE THOUSAND 
SO I STRAIGHTAWAY GET INTO NEGATIVE EQUITY AND HIGHER REPAYMENTS 
HER PROBLEM IS THAT BANKS WITH LESS MONEY TO LEND WANT BORROWERS 
WITH LARGER DEPOSITS OR BIG FEES UP FRONT AND THAT'S A REAL STRETCH 
IT SEEMS A BIT MAD AT THE MOMENT BUT WITH RENTALS SO HIGH IT SEEMS MAD TO KEEP RENTING 
MADNESS INDEED 
BUT IT'S ONLY WHEN THINGS START TO GO WRONG 
THAT WE SEE HOW BRITAIN'S ECONOMY IS AT THE MERCY OF THINGS WAY BEYOND OUR CONTROL 
IN THE SEVENTIES AN ARAB OIL EMBARGO MADE PETROL WERE SCARCE AND SENT PRICES THROUGH THE ROOF 
THEN THE EUROPEAN CURRENCY CRISIS IN THE NINETIES CAUSED BLACK WEDNESDAY 
WHILE HOUSE PRICES TUMBLED 
ANYONE WANT TO BUY A HOUSE 
WATCH OUT EXCUSE ME 
NOW MORE THAN EVER OUR FATE IS TIED TO OTHER COUNTRIES 
BUT THERE ARE BIG DIFFERENCES THIS TIME SOME LOOK LIKE THREATS OTHERS MAY PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES 
TAKE OUR MIGRANT WORKERS SOME BELIEVE THEY COULD KEEP US OUT OF RECESSION BY GOING HOME 
IT WAS UNEMPLOYMENT THAT ROSE SO RAPIDLY WHICH IN MANY WAYS COULD DEFINE RECESSION 
AND WHAT IS INTERESTING THIS TIME IS THAT BECAUSE OF LARGE NUMBERS OF MIGRANT WORKERS 
WE'RE INTO UNKNOWN TERRITORY IN THE LABOUR MARKET WHICH IS EXTRAORDINARY 
IN BRISTOL WORKERS FROM SIXTY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HAVE HELPED BUILD CABOT CIRCUS 
OREST A QUALIFIED DOCTOR IN THE UKRAINE HAS WORKED HERE AS A BRICKLAYER FOR THREE YEARS 
HE IS WORRIED THAT WORK IN BRITAIN MAY DRY UP 
I THINK EVERYBODY IS WORRIED ABOUT THEIR JOB 
THE PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH HERE WHAT MIGHT THEY DO IF JOBS BECOME SCARCER 
I THINK MOST OF THEM FROM THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WILL BE BACK HOME STRAIGHTAWAY 
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T WORK HERE YOU CAN'T PAY ANY EXPENSES SO YOU HAVE TO GO BACK IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT 
IF OREST AND HIS MATES GO HOME THAT COULD LEAVE MORE JOBS FOR BRITISH WORKERS 
GOOD MORNING WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU SOME LIVER PLEASE 
IT'S THE BUYING POWER OF ONE OF THE WORLD'S FASTEST GROWING ECONOMIES 
THAT IS HAVING MOST INFLUENCE OVER WHAT WILL HAPPEN HERE 
AS WEALTH INCREASES IN CHINA SO DOES ITS APPETITE FOR THINGS WE HAVE TAKEN FOR GRANTED 
WHAT HAVE YOU NOTICED ABOUT PRICES 
THEY HAVE GONE SKY HIGH MEAT MILK SUGAR EVERYTHING HAS GONE UP 
ONCE IT GOES UP THEY DO NOT COME DOWN DO THEY 
HOW DO YOU MIND THE PENNIES 
WE CUT DOWN THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE HAD TO DO NOT HAVE SO MUCH 
PRICE RISES FELT BY THE LIKES OF JOHN THORNE 
LIVING ON A FIXED INCOME ARE JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG 
AROUND THE WORLD BASICS LIKE RICE FLOUR 
EVEN TEA ALL RISING 
HERE'S YOUR CHANGE THANK YOU 
IT COULD MEAN THAT OUR YEARS OF STABLE FOOD PRICES ARE OVER 
WE ARE AT THE END OF A RIPPLE EFFECT 
CAUSED BY HUGE JUMPS IN THE COST OF STAPLE FOODS 
AND CHINA'S GROWTH IS BEHIND IT 
PEOPLE'S DIET IS CHANGING THE WEALTH LEVEL IS GOING UP 
SO PEOPLE ARE EATING DIFFERENTLY THERE IS PERHAPS TWICE 
THE CONSUMPTION OF MEAT AND MEAT PRODUCTS NOW IN CHINA 
THAN THERE WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO AND THAT HAS OF COURSE AN IMPACT 
THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT 
IF WE CAN'T CUT OURSELVES OFF FROM THESE POWERFUL INFLUENCES 
BRITISH BUSINESSES MUST EMBRACE THEM 
THIS IS WHY EXPERTS SAY ANY ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN WILL BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME 
CHINA IS BOOMING AND WE CAN GET A STAKE IN THAT BONANZA 
AT DINNERS LIKE THESE BRITISH BUSINESS PLOTS 
HOW WE CAN EARN MORE MONEY IN CHINA AND CHINESE BUSINESS WORKS OUT 
HOW IT CAN DO THE SAME OVER HERE 
WHAT IS THE PRIZE OF DOING BUSINESS WITH CHINA 
PROFITS FOR BRITISH COMPANIES 
WE KNOW THAT FROM COMPANIES WHO HAVE DONE IT 
THEY HAVE COME BACK AND TOLD GOOD STORIES AND ENCOURAGED 
OTHER BUSINESSES TO DO THE SAME 
DO ENOUGH PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM REALISE THAT 
SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM KNOW THAT ALREADY 
THE OTHER TWENTY FIVE PER CENT ARE PROBABLY FEELING THEIR WAY THERE 
I AM IN FINANCIAL SERVICES 
MY COMPANY IS OFFERING INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS 
SO IN BRITAIN YOU SEE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE WE TEND TO LOOK AT IT 
THE OTHER WAY ROUND 
IT IS A TWO WAY THING CHINESE COMPANIES 
HAVE THE RIGHT FINANCE IN THE U. K. AND FOR BRITISH INVESTORS 
CHINA OFFERS A FANTASTIC MARKET THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES IN CHINA 
THE WORLD IS TILTING ON ITS AXIS 
WHERE WE ONCE LOOKED TO AMERICA AS THE WORLD'S ECONOMIC ENGINE 
WE NOW LOOK TO THE EAST TO THROW US A LIFELINE 
MANY BUSINESS LEADERS INCLUDING AN INTERNATIONAL DRINKS MANUFACTURER SEE IT AS A GOOD THING 
AND ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE 
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN IF THE U. S. CAUGHT A COLD 
EMERGING MARKETS WOULD GET PNEUMONIA IT'S NO LONGER THE CASE 
THIS IS CHANGING THE ECONOMIC RULES OF THE GAME I BELIEVE IT IS 
MARKETS LIKE CHINA AND THE INVESTMENTS IN OTHER MARKETS THAT 
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AND CHINESE ENTERPRISE ARE MAKING MEANS THAT 
THE U. S. IS NOT THE FOCAL POINT IT USED TO BE 
CHINA IS NOT THE ONLY GOVERNMENT WAKING UP TO THE FACT 
THAT THESE COULD BE GOOD INVESTMENTS 
THERE IS CHINESE MONEY IN BARCLAYS THE MINING COMPANY R. T. Z. AND THEY OWN ROVER 
THEY'VE INVESTED IN PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS HIDDEN OPERATORS IN THE ECONOMY 
THEY HAVE SPENT BILLIONS SUPPORTING OUR BANKS FOR THAT 
THEY MIGHT WANT SOMETHING IN RETURN 
THEY HAVE GOT ALL THE MONEY AT THE MOMENT 
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT GETS RECYCLED AROUND THE WORLD 
I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING 
LOOK DOWN THE ROAD TEN YEARS' TIME 
IT IS HARD TO TELL IF THEY OWN SO MUCH 
WILL THAT BECOME A POLITICAL PROBLEM THEN 
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF WHAT I CALL FINANCIAL TERRORISM 
YOU TAKE A STAKE IN A COMPANY YOU INFLUENCE THAT COMPANY 
AND YOU USE IT FOR YOUR OWN POLITICAL MEANS 
I DON'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE FEARFUL 
IT IS A NATURAL PHENOMENA 
THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE WILL CONTINUE TO OPEN UP 
AND FOR COMPANIES LIKE OURSELVES THAT REPRESENTS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY 
THE ONLY PROBLEM COMES IF BUSINESS DOES NOT SEIZE THAT OPPORTUNITY 
MANY MANUFACTURERS ARE DOING THAT 
OUR BRISTOL BALLOON MAKERS HAVE SET THEIR SIGHTS ON GROWING ECONOMIES 
WHICH STILL HAVE CASH TO SPLASH 
WHAT WE WOULD HAVE CALLED THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES NOT LONG AGO 
IS WHERE OUR BUSINESS EXPANSION IS COMING FROM 
NOT JUST THE FAR EAST BUT PLACES LIKE TURKEY EGYPT SOUTH AMERICA 
THEY WILL ONLY WIN THE BUSINESS IF THEY CAN SELL SOMETHING THAT CANNOT 
BE PRODUCED MORE CHEAPLY ELSEWHERE AND THAT MEANS HAVING UNIQUE SKILLS 
SURELY THIS IS THE TYPE OF WORK THAT WOULD HAVE GONE TO VIETNAM OR CHINA 
A LONG TIME AGO 
THESE ARE BESPOKE PRODUCTS IT IS MORE LIKE A SAVILE ROW SUIT 
WHERE PEOPLE IN THE FAR EAST ARE GOOD AT MASS PRODUCING THINGS 
THIS IS NOT MASS PRODUCTION 
THIS IS SKILFUL PRODUCTION IT REQUIRES YEARS OF EXPERIENCE 
AND QUITE FRANKLY PEOPLE LIKE THE CHINESE ARE NOT OUR MAIN THREAT 
IN A WORLD WHERE CHINA DOMINATES LOW SKILL MANUFACTURING 
AND INDIA SPECIALISES IN LOW SKILL SERVICES 
WE WILL ONLY REPAIR THE DAMAGE TO OUR FALTERING ECONOMY 
WTIH BRAIN POWER AND CREATIVITY OFFERING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 
THAT CANNOT BE BEATEN 
OTHER CITIES ARE NOT IN SUCH A FORTUNATE POSITION 
CITIES LIKE LIVERPOOL FOR EXAMPLE OVER A THIRD OF THE ADULT WORKFORCE 
DON'T HAVE ANY FORMAL QUALIFICATIONS 
IT IS NO ACCIDENT THAT CITIES LIKE THAT PERFORM LESS WELL 
THAN THOSE LIKE BRISTOL WHERE ONE THIRD OF THE ADULT POPULATION 
HAVE GOT GRADUATE DEGREES 
COMPETITION FROM CHINA AND OTHER GROWING ECONOMIES IS NOT GOING AWAY 
IN FUTURE WE NEED TO BE BETTER PREPARED FOR ECONOMIC CRASHES 
OR WE WILL BE LOOKING TO THE EAST FOR AN EVEN BIGGER HELPING HAND THAN THIS TIME 
THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE 
YOU DON'T THINK WE ARE SELLING THE FAMILY SILVER 
WE ARE SELLING THE FAMILY SILVER ARE WE GETTING A GOOD PRICE 
WE MAY NOT BE GETTING A GOOD PRICE FOR IT 
THE QUESTION IS WHAT WERE THE ALTERNATIVES 
WHEN YOU HAVE PROFLIGATE LIVING AND YOU HAVEN'T SAVED 
AND ALL YOU HAVE LEFT IS THE FAMILY SILVER 
YOU MAY NOT HAVE MUCH CHOICE 
UNLIKE THE CHINESE WHO ARE INVESTING MONEY AS THEIR ECONOMY BOOMS 
IN OUR GOLDEN YEARS WE SIMPLY WENT OUT AND BLEW THE LOT 
IN TWENTY YEARS WE WILL LOOK BACK 
AND WE WILL SEE AMERICA AND EUROPE LOOKING A BIT LIKE 
THE FALL OF THE ROMAN AND GREEK EMPIRES AND WE WILL SEE 
THESE VERY STRONG ECONOMIES TO THE EAST WHERE PEOPLE SAVE MORE 
WE MAY REGRET HAVING HAD THESE SPLURGES ON THE HIGH STREET 
YOU CAN'T SAY WE DIDN'T WARN YOU 
DECLAN CURRY REPORTING 
ONE SURVEY SUGGESTED THAT THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD 
IS NOW HAVING TO SPEND TWENTY ONE THOUSAND A YEAR JUST TO PAY THE MORTGAGE 
AND THE EVERYDAY BILLS 
YOU CAN SEE DECLAN MOST DAYS ON BREAKFAST AND NEWS TWENTY FOUR
