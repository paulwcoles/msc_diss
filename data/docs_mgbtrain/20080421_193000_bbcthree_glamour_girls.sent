THE ASPIRATIONS OF BRITISH TEENAGERS HAVE CHANGED HANG ON GET THE GIRLS OUT 
IN A RECENT SURVEY OF GIRLS AGED FIFTEEN TO NINETEEN 
ALMOST TWO THIRDS ADMITTED THAT GLAMOUR MODELLING IS THEIR DREAM JOB 
I JUST WANT THIS SO MUCH I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME 
BUT IT'S A CUT THROAT INDUSTRY 
IF WE WERE SELLING ARMPITS THAT'S THE SHOT 
AND ONLY A FEW MAKE IT TO THE TOP 
WE CAN'T START UNLESS THE HAIR AND MAKE UP'S PERFECT 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTY YEARS 
GLAMOUR AGENCY SAMANTHA BOND MANAGEMENT OPENS ITS DOORS TO REVEAL THE TEARS 
THEY SAID I WAS SO GOOD 
AND YOU ARE AND YOU ARE GOOD 
THE TANTRUMS YOU'VE BEEN IN THE SPORT WITH YOUR CLOTHES ON 
I'VE DONE TOPLESS IN NUTS AND THE PRESSURES 
THEY SAID I WAS FAT SUPPOSEDLY 
THIS IS LIFE AS A GLAMOUR GIRL 
MODELLING'S NOT AS GLAMOROUS AS PEOPLE THINK IT IS 
COMING UP 
THE AGENCY OPENS ITS DOORS TO A BATCH OF POTENTIAL NEW SIGNINGS 
SAMANTHA WHAT'S YOUR NAME 
A TOPLESS SHOOT IN TENERIFE RAISES TEMPERATURES 
MATE HAVEN'T YOU SEEN A NAKED WOMAN 
AND COULD ONE OF SAM'S MOST EXPERIENCED MODELS BE OVER THE HILL AT JUST TWENTY FOUR 
I'M AT A POINT WHERE I'M THINKING IS MY DAYS OVER WITH GLAMOUR 
IT'S DROP IN WEEK AT SAMANTHA BOND'S AGENCY IN CHELSEA 
AGENT SAM P. A. NIKKI AND MODEL BOOKER CHRISSY ARE HOLDING 
ONE OF THEIR REGULAR OPEN HOUSE SESSIONS FOR WANNABE GLAMOUR MODELS 
MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED GIRLS CONTACT THE AGENCY EVERY MONTH 
SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR THEY HAVE A WEEK WHEN ANY GIRL CAN WALK IN 
IT'S THE AGENCY'S CHANCE TO SPOT THE NEXT BIG STAR 
TO BE IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA AND HAVE THAT GLAMOROUS LIFE SORT OF THING 
I'D REALLY ENJOY DOING IT 
PLEASE LET ME GET IN SAM BOND'S AGENCY 
WITH ME I DON'T SEE THE POINT IN WORKING FOR HOURS AND HOURS 
AND NOT REALLY GETTING NO MONEY 
I'D PREFER TO DO SOMETHING I ENJOY DOING 
I BROUGHT MY BIBLE WITH ME TODAY JUST IN CASE 
THE THING IS SAM BOND IS LOOKING FOR A PARTICULAR TYPE OF GIRL 
HI KATE I'M SAMANTHA 
SAMANTHA BOND IS THE FIRST LADY OF GLAMOUR 
THERE'S ONE PICTURE WHICH WE LOVE OF HER IN THE DRESS IT'S GORGEOUS 
SHE'S RUN BRITAIN'S PREMIER GLAMOUR AGENCY FOR THIRTY YEARS 
AND DISCOVERED SOME OF THE INDUSTRY'S BEST KNOWN NAMES 
INCLUDING ORIGINAL GLAMOUR GIRL JORDAN 
SHE WAS ONCE A SUCCESSFUL MODEL HERSELF 
WHICH MAKES HER ONE OF THE TOUGHEST JUDGES IN THE BUSINESS 
WHAT WE LOOK FOR IN A MODEL IS OBVIOUSLY A PHOTOGENIC FACE 
A GOOD FIGURE AND A PROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE 
THE GIRL'S GOING TO REALLY LOVE THE JOB AND IF SHE LOVES THE JOB IT BRINGS HER PERSONALITY OUT 
AND THAT'S A GREAT HELP AS WELL IT MAKES HER INTO A REAL WINNER 
AS SOON AS A GIRL COMES THROUGH THE DOOR I BASICALLY KNOW WHETHER SHE'S GOT IT OR NOT 
CAN YOU STAND UP FOR A MINUTE YEAH SURE 
WHAT IT TAKES ARE LOOKS THAT WILL APPEAL TO LADS' MAGS TABLOIDS AND TOP LINGERIE BRANDS 
SAM KNOWS WHAT APPEALS TO THOSE CLIENTS AND MAGAZINES 
THEY WANT A PRETTY FACE HEIGHT AND NATURAL CURVES 
GIRLS THAT DON'T FIT THE PROFILE ARE SHOWN THE DOOR 
QUITE FLAT CHESTED AND OUR GIRLS ARE GENERALLY CURVY A. R. E. THEY 
I MEAN I'M A THIRTY TWO C. IS THAT TOO SMALL 
YOU'RE VERY SMALL YEAH 
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SAY NO 
SAM'S SECOND IN COMMAND IS NIKKI DIAMOND 
COULD YOU GIVE ME A CALL AT THE AGENCY AS SOON AS YOU GET THIS MESSAGE 
SHE'S A FORMER GLAMOUR MODEL WHO WAS ON SAM'S BOOKS HERSELF 
AND PLAYED SCORPIO IN CULT T. V. SERIES GLADIATORS 
WE ALL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO TURN THE GIRLS DOWN BECAUSE THEY COME IN HERE INCREDIBLY NERVOUS 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO TO THEM 
BECAUSE WE DO TRY AND BE VERY FRIENDLY BUT I WOULD NEVER TURN A GIRL DOWN IN A NASTY FASHION 
SHE HAS TO LIVE WITH HERSELF WHY SHOULD I BURST HER BUBBLE 
WHY SAY ANYTHING CRUEL AND UNKIND 
AS THEY WAIT FOR MORE GIRLS TO TURN UP 
ONE OF THEIR MOST EXPERIENCED MODELS IS ON THE PHONE TO NIKKI 
TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD LOUISE GLOVER HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR TWO YEARS 
I KNOW YOU'RE HERE AND AVAILABLE YEAH 
I KNOW YOU ARE 
OH LOUISE NO NO NO NO I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS NOW 
I'VE HAD ENOUGH WE PUT YOU FORWARD 
I HAD A REAL GO AT YOU TO PUSH YOU FOR IT SO DON'T MAKE OUT IT'S NOT US PUTTING YOU THERE WE TRIED 
AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO THAT LOUISE 
I'M GETTING TO THE STAGE WHERE I'VE HAD ENOUGH 
I TRIED YEAH BASICALLY 
YES BECAUSE YOU PHONE ME UP AND YOU KEEP SAYING THAT WE'RE NOT PUSHING YOU HERE AND THERE 
AND WE DO PUT YOU FORWARD AND FOR SOME REASON IT DOESN'T COME UP 
I CAN'T SAY THIS AGAIN LOUISE I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW WHY 
I WILL NOT BE BLAMED FOR THE FACT THAT A PHOTOGRAPHER WON'T SEE YOU 
I HAVEN'T GOT ANSWERS TO EVERYTHING 
WELL THE THING IS THAT YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY A LOT BETTER THAN MOST OF THE GIRLS OUT THERE AT THE MOMENT 
THERE'S NO DOUBT 
I'VE NEVER MET SOMEONE WHO IS SO FANTASTIC AND NATURAL IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA 
NO I KNOW I KNOW 
I HATE HEARING YOU THIS SAD BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME IN HERE AND SEE US I THINK 
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF 
ALL RIGHT BYE DARLING BYE 
YOU'VE GOT THE PATIENCE OF JOB 
OH I DID FEEL SORRY FOR HER ACTUALLY 
SHE WAS GETTING HERSELF INTO SUCH A STATE I KNOW 
SHE'S CRYING HER EYES OUT 
AND I DO FEEL SORRY FOR HER BECAUSE 
THE THING IS SHE IS TECHNICALLY BRILLIANT 
AND SHE'S BEAUTIFUL AND SHE HAS INCREDIBLE VISUAL EYE BECAUSE SHE WAS SAYING 
BASICALLY ALL THAT AGGRESSION IS VULNERABILITY 
IT IS 
LOUISE GLOVER HAS BEEN IN THE GLAMOUR BUSINESS FOR SIX YEARS 
IN THAT TIME SHE'S GRACED THE COVERS OF ALMOST EVERY MEN'S MAGAZINE 
BUT HER LOOK IS NO LONGER IN VOGUE 
I'VE ONLY EVER REALLY WANTED TO BE A MODEL 
I FOR SOME REASON HAVEN'T BEEN OUT TO MANY CASTINGS 
I DO LOOK AT NIKKI AS LIKE MY MENTOR 
IF I WANT ADVICE THEY'RE THE PEOPLE I RING 
IF I AM UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING IN THE INDUSTRY THEY'RE THE PEOPLE I TELL 
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES TO GIVE ME THE ANSWERS 
I'M RINGING THEM TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK 
WHICH MOST MODELS SHOULD DO JUST TO KEEP IN THE MINDS OF THE AGENT 
COS THEY'VE GOT SO MANY NEW GIRLS COMING THROUGH AS WELL AS ALL THE MAIN GIRLS THEY'VE GOT 
AND YOU'RE FORGOTTEN ABOUT SO YOU'VE GOT TO BE ON THE PHONE TO THEM 
IN TENERIFE TWO OF SAM BOND'S MOST SUCCESSFUL GIRLS 
HAVE BEEN FLOWN TO THE ISLAND FOR A SERIES OF PAGE THREE SHOOTS FOR THE SUN 
TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD KATIE DOWNES IS ONE OF AN ELITE CIRCLE OF ONLY SIXTEEN REGULAR SUN GIRLS 
SHE SPENT FOUR YEARS AS THE FACE OF LADS' MAGS LOADED ZOO AND NUTS 
SOMETIMES YOU FEEL LIKE A TRANNY BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THAT MUCH MAKE UP ON 
WELL I DO 
TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD RHIAN SUGDEN WAS SNAPPED UP BY THE SUN 
AS SOON AS SHE STARTED MODELLING JUST EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO 
SHE'S BECOME ONE OF THEIR MOST POPULAR GIRLS 
WELL I'VE SHAVED MY LEGS THE BIKINI LINE 
TO MAKE SURE NOTHING'S HANGING OUT WHILE I HAVE MY PICTURES DONE 
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH KATIE'S HAIR JANE OR IS THAT DONE 
TODAY THEY'RE SHOOTING WITH PAGE THREE PHOTOGRAPHER ALISON WEBSTER 
SHE HAS BEEN SELECTING AND PHOTOGRAPHING GIRLS FOR THE SUN FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS 
WHEN YOU'RE DOING A TOPLESS PHOTO SHOOT THERE'S NO WHERE TO HIDE 
YOU CAN'T HAVE A BIT OF HAIR OVER YOUR FACE 
TO MAKE YOU FEEL A BIT MORE CONFIDENT 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE INCREDIBLY CONFIDENT 
SHALL WE MAKE A MOVE WHILE THE SUN'S OUT GIRLS 
THEY'VE GOT JUST FOUR DAYS TO GET ENOUGH PAGE THREE PICTURES FOR THE NEXT FOUR MONTHS 
I THINK EVERYONE WORKS CAMERAS IN DIFFERENT WAYS 
I'M KIND OF LIKE 
I LIKE TO JUST GET INTO IT YOU KNOW AND IF IT GETS LIKE PLAYING A ROLE YOU NEED TO LIKE FEEL SEXY 
AND YOU NEED TO HAVE DIFFERENT FACES 
I'VE WORKED WITH SOME PHOTOGRAPHERS WHO WILL LIKE SAY PUT YOUR SEX FACE ON 
HAVE YOU HAD THAT NO PUT YOUR SERIOUS FACE ON AND THEN YOUR SMILEY FACE 
I DON'T THINK I GET ASKED TO DO FACES 
YOU JUST DO THEM I JUST DO THEM 
VERY VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE GOT THE FACE THE HAIR THE FIGURE 
THE BODY THE TEETH THE LEGS THE BUM THE BOOBS 
TO GET TO THAT STANDARD 
I'M STILL GETTING USED TO IT I'M QUITE AN EXPRESSIONABLE PERSON 
WITHIN MY FACE ANYWAY YOU KNOW LIKE HI YO WHAT ARE YOU DOING 
YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S ALL IN THE EYES GIVE IT FOUR YEARS FOUR YEARS 
FOUR YEARS I MIGHT BE THERE THEN I'VE BEEN DOING IT SINCE I STARTED 
I HAVEN'T I'VE JUST GOT IT 
I LIKE TO BE PROMPTED SO I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING 
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE PAPER AND A BIG JOB 
AND A HUGE ACHIEVEMENT FOR THE GIRLS 
I MEAN THERE'S SO FEW 
WE ALWAYS TRY AND COMPARE IT TO LIKE ONE PREMIERSHIP FOOTBALL TEAM 
THERE IS ONLY ONE SO YOU KNOW THERE'S ONLY THE SIXTEEN GIRLS 
AND THAT'S IT 
SO TO GET TO THAT TOP PART OF YOUR CAREER 
YOU'VE DONE VERY WELL 
ALISON DECIDES ON A BEACH LOCATION IT'S PUBLIC AND CROWDED WITH HOLIDAY MAKERS 
A READY MADE AUDIENCE 
THE OPEN HOUSE SESSION CONTINUES 
BY NOW SAM AND NIKKI HAVE SEEN FIFTEEN GIRLS AVERAGING AROUND NINETEEN 
AND MOST HAVE ALREADY HAD BOOB JOBS 
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M MEETING YOU TWO BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A DREAM I HAVE BEEN 
IT COULD BE A NIGHTMARE I'VE BEEN ON YOUR WEBSITE LIKE EVERY SINGLE DAY OF MY LIFE 
THE GIRLS ARE SCRUTINISED AND IT COMES DOWN TO POUNDS AND INCHES 
HOW OLD ARE YOU I'M TWENTY 
ARE YOUR BOOBIES NATURAL NO 
AND THE FUNNY THING IS MOST CLIENTS IN THE GLAMOUR INDUSTRY GOOD CLIENTS 
DON'T WANT GIRLS THAT HAVE HAD SILICONE BOOBS LIKE THE SUN THE STAR AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT 
SO THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SAY NO 
THEY'LL GO QUICKLY TO THE SURGEON 
THEY'LL HAVE FALSE BOOBS FALSE HAIR EXTENSIONS FALSE NAILS ORANGE TAN 
THEY WANT TO BE THE NEXT JORDAN 
SO COPYCAT JORDANS DON'T STAND A CHANCE 
MOST OF THE GIRLS ARE UNAWARE OF JUST WHAT THEY NEED TO LOOK LIKE TO GET A FOOT IN THE DOOR 
ARE THEY HAIR EXTENSIONS 
YES 
AND ARE THEY SAWN OFF NAILS YES THERE'S THE UNIFORM 
DO YOU HAVE SILICONE IMPLANTS YES 
WELL THAT FORMULA HAS BEEN DONE AND THE PRIZE HAS BEEN WON 
AFTER HER EMOTIONAL PHONE CALL TO NIKKI 
LOUISE GLOVER VISITS THE AGENCY FOR CRISIS TALKS 
THERE IS PRESSURE COS THERE'S ALWAYS EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS AROUND THE CORNER 
AND TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE LIKE WHAT DO YOU DO NOW 
I NEED A DOG EAT DOG INDUSTRY 
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM FOR AGES I NEED TO HAVE A STRONG CONVERSATION 
ABOUT WHY HASN'T THIS GONE RIGHT 
DO YOU THINK BY CHANGING THIS IT'S GOING TO WORK 
I HAVE GONE THROUGH A LOT OF DRAMATIC CHANGES 
LOUISE HAS HAD SURGERY TO REDUCE HER PREVIOUS BOOB JOBS GOING FROM AN E. CUP TO A C. CUP 
HAVE YOU GOT YOUR BOOK YES 
I'VE GOT LITTLER BOOBS NOW MUCH BETTER MORE PROPORTIONAL 
I'VE GOT TO GO BACK UNDER THE KNIFE JUST ON THIS SIDE BECAUSE THE IMPLANT'S PUSHING THEM SLIGHTLY 
YOU CAN ONLY SEE IT FROM THE ACTUAL SIDE BECAUSE I WANT THEM SO THEY'RE LIKE NATURAL 
I LOVE THOSE 
THE NEXT THING IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH YOU WITH ME HOPEFULLY 
I'VE LISTENED TO EVERYTHING YOU'VE SAID 
I'VE LISTENED TO YOUR ADVICE FROM 
I THINK I'VE GONE AS FAR AS I CAN GO WITH GLAMOUR 
YEAH I HAVE BEEN ON THE COVER OF MAXIM ABROAD 
I'VE BEEN IN FHMS ALL OVER THE WORLD 
I'VE GOT RUSSIAN FHMS I'VE GOT SOUTH AFRICAN AUSTRALIAN SPANISH 
I'VE GOT GERMANY BUT OUR U. K. ONE I JUST DON'T FEEL A LOT OF THEM WILL GIVE ME CHANCE AT ALL 
I'M AT A POINT WHERE I'M THINKING IS MY DAYS OVER WITH GLAMOUR 
I THINK THE ISSUE'S NOT ABOUT BEAUTY ANY MORE I THINK IT'S JUST DOWN TO PERSONALITY 
THE T. V. PEOPLE NOW AREN'T NECESSARILY STUNNERS ARE THEY 
THEY GO OFF INTO THE MAGAZINES 
YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND OF NOT HELPED AS WELL THE REALITY SHOWS 
YOU PUT ME IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA I'VE WORKED WITH GOOD PHOTOGRAPHERS IN AMERICA 
AND I'VE NEVER FELT SO PROUD OF MYSELF BECAUSE SOME OF THE STUFF THEY SAID I WAS SO GOOD 
AND YOU ARE GOOD AND DON'T EVER LOSE SIGHT OF THAT 
YOU KNOW YOU ARE INCREDIBLY GOOD IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA 
IT IS DIFFICULT AND THEY ARE LOOKING FOR BRAND NEW PEOPLE AND THEY DO KNOW YOU 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT TO TRY AND WORK IT SOMEWHERE ELSE 
COME HERE SWEETIE 
COME HERE COME ON 
YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL HERE AND WE'RE NOT GIVING UP O. K. 
AND WE'RE GONNA SORT IT OUT 
O. K. AND YOU HAVE BEEN MAKING CHANGES 
AND YOU I'VE CHANGED SO MUCH THOUGH 
YOU HAVE CHANGED INCREDIBLY 
IT'S GOING TO DO MY HEAD IN DON'T CHANGE ANY MORE 
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T KEEP TRYING TO ADAPT TO EVERY SITUATION 
YOU'LL DRIVE YOURSELF MENTAL 
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE WHO YOU ARE AND YOU KNOW 
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE DRIVING YOURSELF MAD 
YOU'RE TRYING TO BE THIS FOR THAT PERSON THAT FOR THIS PERSON 
JUST BE YOU AND ACCEPT WHEN THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE NOT RIGHT FOR YOU 
AND ACCEPT IT AND JUST MOVE ON 
IF WE CANNOT GET YOU IN THOSE MAGAZINES 
IF FOR WHATEVER REASON WE CAN'T WE HAVE TO TRY DIFFERENT AREAS 
YEAH LET'S JUST GET SOME REALLY NICE WORK FOR YOU 
THINGS THAT GIVE YOU SATISFACTION 
IT WILL HAPPEN JUST KEEP THE FAITH 
O. K. O. K. 
IN TENERIFE RHIAN AND KATIE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR SUN SHOOT 
I KNOW THIS IS A BIT RIGHT IN YOUR FACE WITH ALL THE PEOPLE AROUND 
WE DID ONE THERE BEFORE 
I THINK WITH THE BLACK ROCK AND THOSE FLOWERS IT MIGHT LOOK DRAMATIC 
THEY'RE NOT SHORT OF MALE ONLOOKERS THE ATTENTION COULD BE A PROBLEM 
FACE THAT WAY AND EYES UP 
RHIAN AND KATIE MAY BE USED TO THEIR BODIES BEING EYED UP IN NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES 
BUT FACE TO FACE IS ANOTHER MATTER 
O. K. GO 
NOW THAT GIRL STARTED TO DRAG HER BOYFRIEND AWAY I FEEL ASHAMED 
I'M SORRY I FEEL ASHAMED 
WITH THE GIRLS FEELING SELF CONSCIOUS ALISON MOVES THEM FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH 
SIT DOWN IF IT'S MORE COMFORTABLE AND SHOULDERS SLIGHTLY MORE TO ME 
EVEN IN THE SEA THEY CAN'T ESCAPE THE MALE ATTENTION 
LOVELY GOOD GIRL 
YOU WANT TO MAKE SOME PHOTOS WITH ME 
HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU GOT 
HALF A MILLION 
NOT ENOUGH 
THIS ADMIRER IS OFFERING FIFTY TIMES THE YEARLY INCOME OF A PAGE THREE GIRL 
THEY DON'T DO IT FOR THE PAY 
IT'S THE PRESTIGE AND EXPOSURE OF BEING SEEN BY NEARLY EIGHT MILLION READERS OF THE PAPER 
RIGHT COME ON RHIAN LET'S GET OUT 
I JUST THINK IT'S RUDE TO START TAKING PICTURES 
YOU WOULDN'T WALK UP TO SOMEONE ON THE BEACH THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW AND START TAKING PICTURES 
I THINK IT'S RUDE 
THEY ACT LIKE OH MATE HAVEN'T YOU EVER SEEN A NAKED WOMAN BEFORE 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THERE'S THOUSANDS OF THEM ON THE BEACH PERVERTS I SAY 
I DON'T MIND FROM A DISTANCE BUT WHEN THEY GET PROPER CLOSE 
I'D BE SO ANNOYED IF MY DAD DID THAT ON HOLIDAY 
JUST LIKE PERVING ON LITTLE GIRLS 
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOUR DAD DID IT 
YOUR DAD'S PROBABLY DONE IT LOADS THOUGH MEN ARE MEN 
HE WILL NOT HAVE DONE HE'LL BE IN TROUBLE IF HE HAS MEN CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES 
WHILE KATIE LIVES WITH FRIENDS RHIAN LIVES WITH PARENTS IN RADCLIFFE NEAR MANCHESTER 
BIG SISTER XENA IS USED TO RHIAN'S NEW FOUND FAME 
NICE ONE ISN'T IT 
BUT DAD STEVE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH RHIAN'S CHOICE OF JOB AT FIRST 
WHEN SHE FIRST STARTED I WERE A BIT WARY BUT AS SOON AS SHE WENT IN THE SUN 
I FELT BETTER BECAUSE WELL IT'S OBVIOUSLY A NEWSPAPER 
IT'S NOTHING IT'S NOT SEEDY OR ANYTHING 
I CAN UNDERSTAND FOR MY DAD BECAUSE I WERE HIS LITTLE GIRL OBVIOUSLY 
SO IT'S A BIT WEIRD TO SEE ME NAKED IN THE PAPERS 
THE WHOLE PACKAGE AND NOT THE 
THE GUY WHO SITS NEXT TO ME IN THE CANTEEN WHEN WE'RE HAVING OUR BREW 
IF SHE'S IN IT HE'LL OBVIOUSLY KNOW SHE'S IN IT HE JUST GOES LIKE THAT 
AND LIKE SKIPS IT 
I THINK HE EVEN TRIES 
TO GET TWO PAGES UP 
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR REACTION WILL BE DO THEY 
I'VE ONLY WORKED THERE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS 
I'M HAPPY FOR HER LOADS OF MONEY AND FAMOUS 
FAME IN RADCLIFFE NOT MANY PEOPLE CAN SAY THAT NOT REALLY 
THE SUN SETS ON A FRUSTRATING FIRST DAY 
THE GIRLS HAVE THREE DAYS TO GET THEIR PICTURES THEY HANG OUT WITH EACH OTHER 
OFTEN MEETING FOR THE FIRST TIME ON SHOOTS LIKE THIS 
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN MADE UP FOR A DAY IT'S GOOD TO GO OUT 
COS YOU STILL HAVE FULL MAKE UP ON 
IT'S A GOOD THING ALTHOUGH AN EYELASH HAS COME A BIT LOOSE 
BUT APART FROM THAT I THINK I LOOK ALL RIGHT 
IT'S HALFWAY THROUGH THE OPEN CASTING WEEK AND THE AGENCY HAVEN'T SEEN ONE GIRL THEY'D SIGN UP 
HOW ARE YOU 
HOW TALL ARE YOU FIVE FEET SIX INCHES 
FIVE FEET FIVE INCHES FIVE FEET FIVE INCHES 
I'M FIVE FEET SIX INCHES I THINK YOU'RE MAYBE NOT QUITE RIGHT FOR US 
CAN YOU TURN AROUND 
I'M A THIRTY TWO B. TWENTY THREE WAIST AND I THINK I'M A THIRTY SIX HIPS 
THIS TIME I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY NO 
THE AGENCY IS KNOWN FOR GIRLS THAT ARE CURVY 
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK WE HAVE TO SAY NO 
THE AGENTS ARE FRUSTRATED BY THE STEREOTYPICAL IMAGE THEY KEEP SEEING 
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON 
IN MAGAZINES THEY SEE GIRLS WHO LOOK LIKE THAT 
THEY COPY THAT LOOK BUT IF THEY LOOK IN SOME OF THE OTHER MAGAZINES 
THEY'LL SEE THAT THE GIRLS WHO ARE ACTUALLY MAKING FRONT COVERS 
LIKE KATIE AND RHIAN ARE THE GIRLS WHO ARE NATURAL 
WHO ARE NATURAL AND JUST HAVE A BEAUTIFUL LOOK AND AN INDIVIDUALITY 
MODEL BOOKER CHRISSY THINKS SHE MIGHT HAVE FOUND SOMEONE 
THIS MORNING ON THE TUBE SHE SPOTTED A GIRL SHE BELIEVES HAS REAL POTENTIAL 
SO WHAT'S SHE LIKE SHE'S ABOUT FIVE FEET NINE INCHES 
GREAT SHE'S REALLY TALL WHAT'S HER FIGURE LIKE 
SHE'S QUITE CURVY AS WELL 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE APPROACHED SOMEONE ISN'T IT 
YES 
WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT YOUR EYE WAS LIKE 
SAM WHO'S BEEN SCOUTING GIRLS FOR THIRTY YEARS IS DOUBTFUL 
THE GIRL IN QUESTION IS A DANCER CALLED AMY DIAMOND 
SHE'S NEVER MODELLED BEFORE 
MODELLING'S ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING I'VE WANTED TO DO 
BUT I'M CURVIER THAN MOST GIRLS SO THINGS LIKE HIGH FASHION AND CATWALK 
HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN AN OPTION TO ME I HAVEN'T THOUGHT 
AND MY MOTHER SAYS THAT IF YOU'VE GOT IT FLAUNT IT 
IF AMY'S ANY GOOD THIS COULD BE A REAL COUP FOR CHRISSY 
IT IS DIFFICULT 
WE'LL SEE IN A MINUTE BECAUSE I THINK SHE'S JUST ARRIVED 
RIGHT HELLO HI 
THIS IS NIKKI AND SAM 
HI NIKKI I'M AMY NICE TO MEET YOU 
HI SAM HI AMY 
NICE TO MEET YOU HAVE A SEAT 
SO I HEAR OUR CHRISSY FOUND YOU ON THE TUBE 
I THOUGHT SHE WAS COMING OVER TO HELP ME BECAUSE I LOOKED A BIT LOST 
I WAS A BIT SCARED BEING APPROACHED BY A RANDOM LADY ON THE TUBE BUT 
CAN WE SEE YOU WITHOUT THE COAT PLEASE YEAH 
PLEASANTRIES OUT OF THE WAY SAM AND NIKKI TURN A CRITICAL EYE ON AMY 
I CAN SEE ONE LITTLE PROBLEM AREA WHICH I KNOW SAMANTHA WILL HAVE SEEN YEAH LOVELY AND TALL 
EVERYTHING'S GOING THERE BUT THE HAIR IS LETTING YOU DOWN 
IT'S JUST OVER BLEACHED 
I THINK IF YOU SORT THAT HAIR OUT YOU'D LOOK FANTASTIC 
A LOT OF GIRLS THINK ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS PUT IN HAIR EXTENSIONS PUT ON FAKE NAILS 
BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT BECAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE ALL THE OTHERS WHO WANT TO BE MODELS 
THEY THINK IT'S SOME SORT OF UNIFORM THEY ALL COME LIKE THAT 
SO WHAT SORT OF WORK WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO 
I'M OPEN TO DIFFERENT JOBS DEFINITELY 
WOULD YOU DO TOPLESS ERM 
YEAH I THINK IF IT WAS THE RIGHT SITUATION AND TASTEFUL 
AND I FELT COMFORTABLE WITH IT I THINK I WOULD YEAH 
SHE'S GOOD WHAT DO YOU THINK 
WELL I THINK ONCE HER HAIR IS SORTED OUT I THINK SHE'S GREAT 
IT'S A RESULT AMY DIAMOND COULD BE THE REAL DEAL 
THANKS CHRISSY 
SEE YOU SOON BYE 
BYE BYE SWEETHEART 
OH GOSH THAT WAS REALLY NERVE RACKING 
THEY WERE REALLY REALLY NICE 
SO WHAT DO WE ALL THINK ABOUT AMY 
HER BODY'S GREAT 
I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO SEE WHEN WE GET PICTURES OF HER 
EXACTLY HOW GOOD IT IS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT'S DIFFICULT TO TELL 
ALSO BECAUSE SHE'S A DANCER IT MEANS IT SHOULD BE A GOOD TIME KEEPER AND SHE'LL BE DISCIPLINED 
YEAH THOSE DANCE GIRLS KNOW HOW TO KEEP TIME 
ABSOLUTELY AND DISCIPLINED MODELS AS WELL 
WE HAVEN'T GOT MANY OF THOSE IT WOULD MAKE A CHANGE 
SO WELL DONE THANKS 
NEXT MORNING IN TENERIFE 
KATIE AND RHIAN BRACE THEMSELVES FOR ANOTHER DAY'S SHOOT 
TO AVOID THE STARES AND UNWANTED ATTENTION OF THE DAY BEFORE 
ALISON HAS FOUND A MORE PRIVATE SPOT WHERE THEY CAN COMPLETE THE ASSIGNMENT 
SHOULDERS DOWN AND JUST DO ME A LITTLE BIT MORE SIDIES 
AFTER JUST TWO HOURS THEY'VE GOT ALL THE SHOTS THEY NEED 
AND AFTER LESS THAN TWO DAYS' WORK 
THE GIRLS HAVE THE REST OF THE TIME TO THEMSELVES 
OH IF I GET JUST A BIT MORE BROWNER THEN I'LL BE ALL RIGHT 
IN CHELSEA SAM AND NIKKI ARE MEETING A FORMER PAGE THREE STAR WHO QUIT THREE YEARS AGO 
HI ANNA 
TWENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD ANNA TAVERNER APPEARED IN THE STAR AND SUN EVERY WEEK FOR FOUR YEARS 
NOW SHE WANTS TO MAKE A COME BACK 
HI DARLING HOW ARE YOU 
LONG TIME NO SEE 
YOU LOOK AMAZING 
YOU ARE SWEET YOU LOOK AMAZING 
ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO I BROKE UP FROM A GUY 
WE HAD OUR PENTHOUSE APARTMENT ON CHELSEA BRIDGE AND WE WERE 
WE WERE LIKE YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT CHILDREN MARRIAGE THE LOT 
AND THAT KIND OF WENT WRONG 
I WAS BEING VERY DOMESTIC AND LIKE A GOOD LITTLE HOUSEWIFE 
AND NOW I'M BACK 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR BOOK 
BUT THREE YEARS IS A LONG TIME IN GLAMOUR 
OLDER MODELS ARE QUICKLY FORGOTTEN IN THE FLOOD OF FRESH YOUNG FACES FIGHTING TO MAKE IT 
GENERALLY OUR GIRLS ARE BETWEEN EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE 
WHEN THEY GET TO TWENTY FIVE THEY EITHER STAY WITH US BECAUSE THEY BECOME ESTABLISHED 
OR THEY WILL MOVE ON TO A DIFFERENT TYPE OF AGENCY THAT DO A DIFFERENT TYPE OF WORK 
ANNA'S PHOTOS GET THE ONCE OVER 
OH ANNA YEAH THERE'S NOT REALLY ONE HERE I CAN SAY YEAH THAT ONE 
IT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T 
NO IT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE AS OVERTLY GLAMOURY ON THE SITE ANY MORE 
WE'VE TONED IT RIGHT DOWN 
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAS REALLY LIKE LOOKING FORWARD TO 
YOU NEED TO REALLY MAKE YOUR BOOK VERY NICE AND COMMERCIAL 
GLAMOUR COMMERCIAL RATHER THAN THIS OVERT GLAMOUR IMAGE 
I COMPLETELY AGREE 
THANK YOU 
ANNA'S RETURN TO GLAMOUR NOW DEPENDS ON SOME MODERN PHOTOS 
THAT WILL SELL HER TO A BROADER MARKET 
SHE CAN DO GLAMOUR ADVERTISING WORK BUT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET COMMERCIAL WORK AS WELL 
AND SHE'S GOT THE PERSONALITY TO CARRY IT OFF EVEN THOUGH SHE'S A LITTLE OLDER 
SO WHAT'S THE VERDICT 
AM I GIVEN THE O. K. FROM YOU GUYS 
WE WOULDN'T HAVE GOT YOU TO FILL IN A FORM IF IT WEREN'T YOU NUTCASE THANKS 
WELL IT'S VERY NICE TO MEET YOU 
THANK YOU SO MUCH 
ON MERSEYSIDE LOUISE GLOVER IS GETTING INTO HER MAKE UP AND GLAD RAGS 
BUT NOT FOR A PHOTO SHOOT 
SHE AND HUSBAND BEN ARE CELEBRATING THEIR FIRST WEDDING ANNIVERSARY 
WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS IN SAINT HELEN'S 
IT'S BEEN A YEAR SINCE LOUISE LAST SAW HER FAMILY 
GOING HOME WILL BE A BIG REMINDER OF HOW DIFFERENT HER LIFE HAS BECOME 
PEOPLE I'VE MET IN LONDON MOST OF THEM ARE MODELS AND I'M COMPETING WITH THEM ALL THE TIME 
IT'S NOT THAT IT'S A BITCHY INDUSTRY IT'S JUST NATURAL INSTINCT THAT 
IT'S LIKE ANIMALS AND THE PREDATORS AROUND THEM LIKE A LEOPARD AND A CHEETAH 
THEY'RE TRYING TO CATCH THE SAME FOOD 
IT'S THE SAME AS MODELLING BUT WHEN I COME HOME THESE ARE MY FRIENDS 
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE I GREW UP WITH AND THEY ARE TRUE AND LOYAL 
AFTER EIGHTEEN MONTHS TOGETHER SCAFFOLDER HUSBAND BEN KNOWS JUST HOW MUCH LOUISE HAS GIVEN UP 
TO BE IN THE GLAMOUR BUSINESS 
MY LIFE IS NOT SCAFFOLDING YOU KNOW BUT HER LIFE ACHIEVEMENT IS TO BECOME A BETTER MODEL 
YOU CAN ALWAYS BE A BETTER MODEL AND SHE THRIVES TO BE BETTER EVERY DAY OR EVERY SHOOT 
BECAUSE SHE'S SO ENTHUSIASTIC AND SO WORK ORIENTATED 
SOMETIMES SHE'S ITCHING FOR THINGS TO DO AND IF SHE'S SENDING E. MAILS AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
WHEN SHE'S NOT ACTUALLY IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA SHE KIND OF GETS A LITTLE BIT LOST 
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S HER WORK AND SHE'S WORKED VERY HARD 
AT THE LOCAL PUB HER FAMILY AND OLD SCHOOL FRIENDS HAVE TURNED OUT FOR THE PARTY 
THEY'RE PROUD OF THE LIFE SHE'S MANAGED TO MAKE FOR HERSELF IN LONDON 
A LOT OF HER FRIENDS NOW THEY'RE SINGLE MOTHERS 
AND LIVING IN A HOUSE AND NOT DOING NOTHING 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
BUT SHE'S GOT UP AND SHE'S MADE A NAME FOR HERSELF 
ONLY ONE OF LOUISE'S FRIENDS FROM LONDON JOINS THE PARTY 
ANDY LESAUVAGE IS A PHOTOGRAPHER WHO HAS WORKED WITH LOUISE FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS 
LOUISE MAKES THE MOST OF HAVING HIM THERE 
I'LL TAKE TWO PICTURES ONE ON MY CAMERA ARE YOU READY 
LAST YEAR I GAVE HER AWAY AT HER WEDDING IN VEGAS 
THERE WE WERE IN THE GRAND CANYON A MILLION MILES AWAY FROM HERE WHERE SHE WAS BORN AND BROUGHT UP 
AND IT'S REALLY NICE TO SEE WHERE SHE'S GONE REALLY 
SHE'S FROM UP NORTH HERE EVERYBODY HAS TO FIGHT FOR WHAT THEY WANT 
THEY'RE REAL PEOPLE REALLY DOWN TO EARTH PEOPLE 
LONDON IS VERY MUCH MORE FAKE YOU'VE GOT TO BE A DIFFERENT PERSON 
A BIT OF HER IS HERE ALTHOUGH SHE'S IN A DIFFERENT WORLD DOWN THERE 
IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD SHE'S IN 
NEXT TIME ON GLAMOUR GIRLS LOUISE FIGHTS FOR HER CAREER 
YOU'VE GOT A FACE A VERY GOOD FACE 
YOU'LL CHOOSE THE PAGE THREE GIRLS BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT THE RIGHT BOOBS 
KATIE DEFENDS HERS YOU'VE BEEN IN THE SPORT WITH YOUR CLOTHES ON 
DON'T TRY AND PUT ME DOWN COS I'VE DONE NUTS TOPLESS IN NUTS AND YOU'RE SAYING YOU WOULDN'T DO NUTS 
AND WILL AMY'S NEW LOOK IMPRESS SAM 
NOT VERY GLAMOUR MODEL AT THE MINUTE IS IT
