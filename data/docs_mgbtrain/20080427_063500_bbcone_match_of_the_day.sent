HELLO ON MATCH OF THE DAY THIS 
WEEK THE MOST EAGERLY AWAITED GAME 
OF THE SEASON A MATCH THAT COULD 
EFFECTIVELY END THE TITLE RACE AS 
WELL AS CHELSEA VERSUS MANCHESTER 
UNITED WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CRUCIAL 
GAMES FROM THE OTHER END OF THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE TOP FLIGHT STATUS 
IS AT STAKE ALAN HANSSON AND MARK 
LAWRENSON CANNOT WAIT TO SINK THEIR 
DENTURES INTO IT ONLY ONE PLACE TO 
START STAMFORD BRIDGE A WIN FOR 
MANCHESTER UNITED WITH THEIR 
SUPERIOR GOAL DIFFERENCE WOULD 
PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE THE TITLE 
REMAINING AT OLD TRAFFORD A WIN 
FOR CHELSEA AND THE PRESSURE WOULD 
MOUNT JONATHAN PEARCE COMMENTATES NEARLY A BILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE 
ARE WATCHING A SATURDAY BRUNCH 
CRUNCH WHICH KICKS OF THE DEFINING 
WEEK FOR THESE CLUBS CHELSEA HAD 
CLINCHED THE TITLE BEATING UNITED 
HERE CHELSEA MADE THREE CHANGES TO THEIR 
DRAW AT LIVERPOOL MICHAEL ESSIEN 
REPLACES FRANK LAMPARD THEY WEAR BLACK ARMBANDS IN MEMORY OF LAMPARD THEY FIRST MET THIRTEEN YEARS AGO THERE 
IS A MUTUAL ADMIRATION BETWEEN THE 
SIR ALEX FERGUSON AND AVRAM GRANT 
THEY ARE SMILING BEFOREHAND ONE OF 
THEM MAY NOT BE AT FULL TIME CHELSEA ALL IN BLUE AND KICKING 
FROM RIGHT TO LEFT THEY HAVE NINETY 
MINUTES TO SAVE THEIR PREMIER 
LEAGUE TITLE CAMPAIGN THERE COULD BE A DANGER FROM SET 
PIECES TODAY ONE THIRD OF 
MANCHESTER UNITED'S GOALS CONCEDED 
HAVE COME FROM HEADERS BUT THEY 
HAVE ONLY CONCEDED NINETEEN ALL SEASON CHELSEA NEARLY PROFITING FROM 
BROWN'S ERROR A NERVOUS START FROM 
THE DEFENDER MICHAEL ESSIEN AGAIN TWICE HE HAS GONE FORWARD TO SUPPORT THE STRIKERS CHELSEA HAVE STARTED LIKE A TEAM 
KNOWING THEY HAVE TO WIN 
MANCHESTER UNITED HAVE STARTED LIKE 
A TEAM KNOWING THAT THE DRAW WILL 
DO THE REFEREE HAS NOT NOTICE THAT 
NEMANJA VIDIC IS ON THE GROUND 
UNITED ARE PLAYING ON INTERESTINGLY WITH NEMANJA VIDIC 
IN TROUBLE DIDIER DROGBA STAYED 
WITH HIM THROUGHOUT AND CALLED TO 
THE REFEREE TO STOP THINGS THAT 
KNEE CAUGHT HIM HE HAS GONE 
STRAIGHT AWAY WHAT 
YOU REALLY DO NOT NEED WHEN YOU ARE CLOSING IN ON THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE AND CHAMPIONS LEAGUE DOUBLE 
HIS EGG KICK IN THE TEETH IS A 
KICK IN THE TEETH MANCHESTER 
UNITED ARE GOING TO SEND ON OWEN 
HARGREAVES ANY MOMENT BUT CAN THE 
TEN MEN HOLD OUT THAT SHOULDER 
TO SHOULDER BY MIKAEL SILVESTRE WAS CONSIDERED FAIR MANCHESTER UNITED HAD TWENTY FOUR HOURS LESS TO PREPARED TO THIS THEY FLEW STRAIGHT IN FROM BARCELONA THAT CAME FROM MIKAEL SILVESTRE'S 
HAND AND THEY HAVE SIGNALLED 
HANDBALL GOOD DECISION BY THE REFEREE 
SIMPLY HOLDING HIS GROUND OWEN 
HARGREAVES HAS COME ON HE PLAYED 
AT RIGHT BACK IN SPAIN HE WENT FOR IT BUT HE HAD BETTER OPTIONS THE NEWS FROM NEMANJA VIDIC SHE IS 
THAT HE HAS A TOOTH THROUGH HIS LIP 
HE IS RECEIVING TREATMENT IN THE 
DRESSING ROOM ANDERSON'S SQUEEZED BETWEEN JOE COLE PETR CECH ALWAYS LOOKS FOR THE QUICK RELEASE JOE COLE MADE A MESS OF THAT 
OPPORTUNITY INITIALLY BUT VERY 
NEARLY PUT CHELSEA AHEAD IT 
DELAYED TOO LONG INITIALLY THEN 
FLASHED A SHOT IN HE MAY WELL HAVE TO WIN THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE AND THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE TO WIN HIS JOB THAT SEEMS 
OUTRAGEOUS FOUR MINUTES OF STOPPAGE TIME BEING PLAYED MICHAEL BALLACK CHELSEA HAVE 
STAKED A REAL CLAIM FOR THE 
PREMIERE LEAGUE TITLE WITH THAT 
GOAL CHELSEA SHOW JUST TO THAT GOAL IS 
DEDICATED TO PAT LAMPARD FRANK 
LAMPARD'S MOTHER WHO TRAGICALLY 
DIED THIS WEEK DIDIER DROGBA DID 
ALL THE WORK HE SAW MICHAEL BALLACK COMING A 
WELL TAKEN GOAL AND A LOVELY BALL 
TO THEM HE POWERED IN A HEADER FOR 
HIS SEVENTH AND MOST IMPORTANT OF THE 
SEASON AVRAM GRANT HAS BEEN SAYING 
THAT UNITED WILL CRACK IN HIS FIFTIETH 
GAME IN CHARGE HE SEES CHELSEA TAKE 
THE LEAD THROUGH MICHAEL BALLACK WAYNE ROONEY SEEMS TO HAVE A STOMACH PROBLEM THIS IS CRISTIANO RONALDO HE HAS 
SCORED FORTY TWO GOALS FOR CLUB AND 
COUNTRY IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS WAYNE ROONEY STORES RICARDO 
CARVALHO DID NOT HAVE HANDED BACK 
TO HIM MORE EASILY THAT COULD BE 
THE TITLE ON THE PLATE WAYNE 
ROONEY LOOKED IN PAIN AND IN 
TROUBLE HE IS CLEARLY DISTRESSED 
THAT HE HAS GOT THE GOAL THAT PUT 
MANCHESTER UNITED BACK IN THE 
DRIVING SEAT IN THE TITLE RACE 
AGAIN THIS MOMENT COULD HAUNT 
RICARDO CARVALHO FOR HIS ENTIRE 
CAREER A TOTAL LAPSE IN 
CONCENTRATION AND WAYNE ROONEY 
PROFITS ONE TO ONE GHASTLY FOR RICARDO 
CARVALHO WAYNE ROONEY DROVE IT IN 
HE DID IT SUPREMELY WELL CHELSEA ONE 
MANCHESTER UNITED ONE TITLE 
ADVANTAGE AGAIN TO UNITED WAYNE 
ROONEY IS ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE 
PLAYING THROUGH REAL PAIN NOW HE 
IS VIRTUALLY A PASSENGER UNITED DO 
NOT WANT TO PASS THE BALL TO WAYNE 
ROONEY BECAUSE THEY KNOW HE IS 
CARRYING AN INJURY AND IS ABOUT TO 
GO OFF HE SCORED THE GOAL BUT THAT 
WAS COST FOR HIS CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
AMBITIONS RYAN GIGGS WENT FOR GOLF GOAL CRISTIANO RONALDO COMES ON FOR 
WAYNE ROONEY NOT A BAD 
SUBSTITUTION LOOK AT RONALDO AND MICHAEL BALLACK 
THE SCRAMBLE TODAY'S CROWD WILL 
TAKE THE NUMBER OF FANS WHO HAVE 
SEEN MANCHESTER UNITED PLAY THIS 
SEASON TO THREE AND ONE QUARTER MILLION DIDIER DROGBA SCREENS THAT THE WAVE POWERFULLY FROM MIKAEL SILVESTRE THAT IS THE SILLY FREE KICKS TO 
GIVE AWAY WAS IT A FOUL HE LOST 
POSSESSION AND THEN HIS RIGHT FOOT 
CAUGHT JOHN TERRY THERE IS AN 
ARGUMENT AMONG THE CHELSEA PLAYERS 
OVER WHO SHOULD TAKE IT DIDIER 
DROGBA OR MICHAEL BALLACK MICHAEL 
ESSIEN CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT IS 
HAPPENING A BIG MOMENT IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE IN THE BATTLE OF 
THE BIG EGOS MICHAEL BALLACK HAS 
LOST OUT TO DIDIER DROGBA DIDIER 
DROGBA NEARLY SHOWED US WHY EDWIN 
VAN DER SAR GOT HIS HANDS TO IT THE CLOSEST CHELSEA HAVE COME IN THE SECOND HALF DIDIER DROGBA IS BEING CALMS DOWN 
BY SALOMON KALOU BUT STILL HE HAS 
THIS ARGUMENT WITH MICHAEL BALLACK 
OVER THAT FREE KICK THIS IS 
BIZARRE MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
SAYING THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CRACKS 
BEHIND THE SCENES HERE IT WOULD 
SEEM FROM THE BODY LANGUAGE OF ONE 
OR TWO OF THE CHELSEA PLAYERS THAT 
ALL IS NOT AS IT SHOULD BE IT IS A CORNER TO CHELSEA HE IS SO DESPERATE TO ATONE FOR THE ERROR OFF GOES SOLOMAN KALOU WAS THERE A HANDBALL CHELSEA BELIEVE THERE WAS A HANDBALL IT IS A PENALTY THE LINESMAN HAS GIVEN IT THERE WAS MOVEMENT OF THE ARM TO THE BALL IT IS THE FIRST PENALTY MANCHESTER UNITED HAVE LOST THIS SEASON BALLACK TO RESTORE CHELSEA'S LEAD 
HE DOES SO TWO TO ONE AND THE ARGUMENTS 
WILL RAGE SOME WILL SAY IT WAS 
CRUEL TWO TO ONE CHELSEA MOVE LEVEL ON 
POINTS WITH MANCHESTER UNITED AGAIN RONALDO OFF THE LINE BY ASHLEY COLE HE COMPLAINED ABOUT APPEALS FOR A 
PENALTY HE CERTAINLY THOUGHT IT 
WAS FIVE MINUTES OF STOPPAGE TIME 
FOUL GIVEN COLE MUCH CRITICISED BUT RIGHT MAN RIGHT PLACE RIGHT TIME FLETCHER OFF THE LINE AGAIN IT IS A FREE KICK TO CHELSEA FOR 
THAT BUNDLING CHALLENGE BY 
FERDINAND TEMPERS NOW RISE 
FERDINAND BELIEVES THAT HE MADE A 
DRAMA OF IT SHEVCHENKO KEEPS 
THE GOAL THAT COULD GIVE CHELSEA 
THAT TITLE THERE IS NOT TIME FOR MANCHESTER 
UNITED TO GET ANOTHER ATTACK TWO 
GOALS FROM BALLACK CHELSEA HAVE 
DRAWN LEVEL ON POINTS WITH 
MANCHESTER UNITED WITH JUST TWO 
GAMES TO GO IT WILL BE THRILLING 
TO THE VERY LAST GAME 
HAND ON HEART DO YOU THINK IT WAS 
A PENALTY 
IT WAS A CLEAR PENALTY 
MORE THAN THIS WE DESERVE TO WIN 
THE GAME BECAUSE WE WERE BETTER 
THAN MAN UNITED WE PLAYED WITH A 
LOT OF PASSION 
SOME OF THE 
DECISIONS IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS 
HAVE DAMAGED THIS FOOTBALL CLUB 
SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS GAME 
BALLACK I THINK IT IS NECESSARY TO 
MAKE A PENALTY FOR HIS SAKE THE THE VICTORY IS FOR FRANK AND HIS FAMILY 
IT IS A DIFFICULT TIME FOR 
EVERYBODY ESPECIALLY FOR HIS 
FAMILY IT IS A DAY FOR HIM TODAY 
BRILLIANT FOR THE NEUTRAL BECAUSE 
IT GOES TO THE LAST FOR US SPITE OF 
THE SEASON FORTNIGHT YOU WOULD 
HAVE WANTED IT WRAPPED UP OF OF COURSE IT LOOKS AS IF IT IS GOING 
TO GO TO THE WIRE 
A COUPLE OF 
UNFORTUNATE INCIDENTS FERDINAND 
HAS APOLOGISED TO A FEMALE STEWARD 
FOR ACCIDENTALLY KICKING HER AFTER 
THE FINAL WHISTLE FERDINAND SAYS 
HE WAS TRYING TO TAKE OUT FRUSTRATION ON A 
WALL BUT 
ALSO MADE 
CONTACT WITH 
THE UNFORTUNATE WOMAN 
WHO HAS ACCEPTED HIS APOLOGY MORE 
TROUBLE LATER WHEN MANCHESTER 
UNITED PLAYERS WERE INVOLVED IN AN 
ALTERCATION AT CHELSEA GROUND STAFF 
WITH UNITED PLAYERS WERE TAKING 
PART IN A WARMING DOWN SESSION ON 
THE PITCH WHEN A HEATED ROW BROKE 
OUT BETWEEN GROUNDSTAFF PLAYERS 
AND STUART STEWARDS CHELSEA SAY 
THEY WILL STUDY IT AND TAKE 
APPROPRIATE ACTION 
WHEN YOU 
CONSIDER BOTH SIDES PLAYING AWAY 
FROM HOME IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
IT WAS A TRIBUTE TO BOTH MANAGERS 
THAT THEY PLAYED ATTACKING FOOTBALL 
I THOUGHT THE OFFICIALS HAD A GREAT 
AFTERNOON A GAME OF THIS INTENSITY 
THEY LET IT FLOW L. THOUGHT CHELSEA 
WERE THE BETTER SIDE MAN UNITED 
WERE NOT QUICK ENOUGH 
PEOPLE SAYING CHELSEA ARE NOT 
ATTRACTIVE TO WATCH THEY DISPELLED 
THAT MYTH TODAY L. THOUGHT THEY 
PLAYED BRILLIANTLY EVERY GAME IS 
VITAL AS THOUGH IT IN THE GAME IS 
VITAL AS THIS THEY DID WELL YOU YOU PRAISE 
THE OFFICIALS 
BUT UNITED 
WERE GRUMBLING ABOUT DECISIONS THE THE PENALTY KICK THAT WAS GIVEN YOU 
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IF IT COMES MORE 
THAN TWO OUR THREE YARDS FROM THAT 
ANGLE THE 
ASSISTANT GIVES IT 
BUT I 
DO NOT 
THINK THERE 
IS ANY 
DOUBT IT 
IS A STONE 
WALL PENALTY 
KICK AT 
THE 
OTHER END 
THERE IS 
ASSISTANT HE HAS 
NO DOUBT 
HE IS 
CLOSE 
TO IT 
AND HAS A PERFECT VIEW 
AT THE OTHER END I DO NOT THINK 
THERE IS ANYTHING THERE AT 
ALL I 
THINK HE GOES DOWN EASILY L. THINK 
THE REFEREE GOT THAT SPOT ON YOU 
DO SEE ALEX OFF THE LINE GOING 
BALLISTIC ABOUT THE PENALTY KICK 
RONALDO COMES ON AND BALLACK IT IS 
FIFTY TO FIFTY BUT IF YOU START GIVING THEN 
YOU WILL BE GIVING TWELVE AWAY 
GAME I THOUGHT THE REFEREE HAD A 
GOOD AFTERNOON 
ROONEY LOOKED AS 
THOUGH HE MIGHT HAVE THE TITLE BUT 
HE MIGHT HAVE PAID THE PRICE 
CHELSEA WERE ONE TO ZERO UP AND CRUISING 
THIS WAS FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE 
BALL GOAL THEY HAVE SAID IT IS 
A BAD HIP BUT IT LOOKS TO BE LIKE 
IT IS A GROIN OR FURTHER UP 
LAST THING YOU WANT IS THE BALL HE 
DOES UNBELIEVABLY WELL HERE IT IS 
A GREAT GOAL WATCH HIM HE IS 
SAYING DON'T TOUCH ME YOU WOULD 
WORRY ABOUT HIM FOR THE REST OF THE 
SEASON 
IF HE HAS BEEN SOMETHING HE COULD 
BE OUT FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON 
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BAD PLOY TO 
KEEP HIM ON 
STRANGE INCIDENTS POST 
MATCH BUT A FEW ODD GOINGS ON 
DURING THE GAME 
IT EXTRAORDINARY THIS IS BALLACK AND 
DROGBA HE 
CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT IS 
GOING ON IT WAS A GREAT FREE KICK 
AND HE SAID THAT IS THE END OF IT 
BALLACK COMPLETELY BLIGHTS DROGBA 
AND DROGBA GOES TO STEVE CLARKE AND 
HE SAYS I AM GOING TO REAL MADRID 
ANY MORE 
OF THAT 
AND I WILL GO 
TOMORROW MORNING YOU CAN 
DROGBA THIS IS THEIR SIGN OF 
AFFECTION IT IS UNBELIEVABLE THEN 
AT THE END FRIENDS HOSTILITY L. 
THINK SO L. THINK THERE WILL BE REPERCUSSIONS 
EVEN AFTER THAT REPERCUSSIONS THERE WERE SOME AMAZING SCENES THE THE LAST FIVE MINUTES WERE UNREAL WE 
GET ONE OFF THE LINE FROM ASHLEY 
COLE AND THEN ANOTHER ONE SAVED OFF 
THE LINE BY AN UNLIKELY SUSPECT 
LAST MINUTE FLETCHER COMES IN AND 
SHEVCHENKO GETS IT OFF THE LINE 
THAT MIGHT BE HIS BIGGEST 
CONTRIBUTION OF THE SEASON IT WAS 
TIMELY FANTASTIC MANCHESTER 
UNITED BECAUSE OF THE GOAL 
DIFFERENCE AT HOME TO WEST HAM 
NEXT WEEK 
NEWCASTLE HAVE HAD A GOOD RUN I 
THINK IT WILL GO DOWN TO THE VERY 
LAST SUNDAY 
IF YOU HAVE BEEN IN 
THAT POSITION BEFORE YOU KNOW IS ABOUT APPLYING 
PRESSURE AND 
CHELSEA HAVE DONE 
THAT VERY 
WELL 
IT 
IS NOT 
EASY WHEN YOU'RE GOING 
FOR THE TITLE IF YOU LOOK AT 
DOWNSIDE FOR MANCHESTER UNITED NO 
WIN IN THREE IF THEY GO NO WIN IN 
FOUR YOU START TO GET DOUBTS IN 
YOUR MIND 
I THINK WHAT HELPED 
CHELSEA WAS THE FOCUS ON ARSENAL 
SO MANY POINTS IN FRONT AND A SLOW 
WICKET GOING IT HAS BEEN A 
FANTASTIC RECORD 
IT IS AMAZING THE 
MANAGER IS STILL UNDER PRESSURE 
FAVOURITES TO GO TO THE FINAL OF 
THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE RIGHT IN THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP RACE UNDER UNDER 
PRESSURE FOR HIS JOB AND 
AMAZING 
LET'S SWITCH OUR ATTENTION AMAZING NOW TO THOSE LOOKING TO AVOID 
RELEGATION NOT AS PRESTIGIOUS 
MAYBE BUT JUST AS VITAL TO THOSE 
AGAINST 
THEM TODAY 
FULHAM COULD BE 
RELEGATED A WIN THOUGH WOULD THEM A GLIMMER OF 
HOPE BUT 
THEN 
THEY 
HAVE ONLY 
WON THREE AWAY 
IN THREE SEASONS 
THE COMMENTATOR 
AT THE 
CITY OF 
MANCHESTER STADIUM 
WAS TONY GUBBA INJURIES TO DEFENDERS MEAN A 
MAKESHIFT BACK FOUR FOR MANCHESTER 
CITY ELANO IS AT RIGHT BACK 
MICHAEL BALL REPLACES AT CENTRE 
BACK FULHAM ARE UNCHANGED AS THEY 
LOOK FOR A SECOND AWAY WIN IN 
SUCCESSION BRIAN MCBRIDE LEADING 
THE SEARCH FOR GOALS ALONGSIDE 
DAVID HEALY FULHAM HAVE NOT WON 
BACK TO BACK AWAY GAMES FOR FOUR AND ONE HALF 
YEARS OH IT WAS A GLORIOUS CHANCE FOR 
FULHAM JOE HART SHOWS AGAIN WHY HE 
IS THE NUMBER ONE CHOICE FULHAM COMING INTO THIS MATCH STILL 
A MASSIVE FIVE POINTS AWAY FROM 
SAFETY WHAT A GOAL WHAT A BRILLIANT 
BRILLIANT GOAL BY STEPHEN IRELAND 
IT THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE THAT 
HE MADE IT LOOK SIMPLE HAVING 
THREATENED TO TAKE THE LEAD 
THEMSELVES FULHAM ARE PUNISHED FOR 
SOME SLACK DEFENDING THIS IS A 
BRILLIANT FINISH HERE'S BULLARD IT BOUNCED JUST IN 
FRONT OF JOE HART AND MADE IT 
AWKWARD JIMMY BULLARD IS SO MUCH 
THE ENGINE ROOM IN MIDFIELD FOR 
FULHAM 
THE REFEREE WAVED PLAY ON 
WHAT A PASS BY THE RIGHT BACK 
ELANO WHAT A BALL BY THE 
BRAZILIAN VASSELL SCAMPERING ON TO 
IT CUTS IT BACK FOR BENJANI TO 
SCORE HIS THIRD GOAL OF THE SEASON 
AND 
CITY'S SECOND 
OF THE MATCH 
LOOKS AS IF 
FULHAM'S FATE 
WILL BE 
WRAPPED UP THIS AFTERNOON NO ONE 
IN THE GROUND LOOKING MORE 
DISAPPOINTED THAN ROY HODGSON WHAT A GREAT SAVE FROM JOE HART WHAT A TREMENDOUS PROSPECT HE IS 
IF THAT IS THE RIGHT WORD STILL 
ONLY TWENTY ONE A POINT BLANK HEADER FROM 
DAVID HEALY AND HE GOT A VERY SOLID 
HAND ON IT VASSAL STRETCHED KASEY KELLER ROUND THE BACK OF THE BIG FULHAM 
DEFENDER A VERY CRISP LEFT FOOT 
STRIKE KAMARA IT HAS GONE IN THROUGH THE 
LEGS OF JOE HART SUDDENLY IT ALL 
CHANGES MANCHESTER CITY PAYING THE 
PRICE FOR BEING TOO CASUAL IN THE 
SECOND HALF DEMANDS THE KAMARA HAS 
JUST COME ON AS A SUBSTITUTE AND HE 
GOT THE BETTER OF CAR LUCRE HE 
DARTED THROUGH THE LEGS OF THE 
GOALKEEPER VEDRAN CORLUKA AND 
SUDDENLY FULHAM ARE BACK IN THE 
MATCH EVERY GAME NOW THE MANCHESTER CITY 
CAPTAIN HAS BROUGHT A FREE KICK 
WHICH COULD GIVE FULHAM AN 
EQUALISER JIMMY BULLARD HAS PLACED 
THE BALL BUT A WHOLE CLUTCH OF 
PLAYERS ARE HAVING A LOOK AT IT 
PERHAPS HE WILL TRY TO PLACE THE 
BALL TO THE RIGHT OF JOE HART HE DID GO FOR THAT CORNER BUT JOE 
HART WAS RIGHT ACROSS TO KEEP HIM 
OUT AND IT IS STILL IN PLAY JOE HART HAS HAD TO PLAY HIS PART 
THIS TIME JIMMY BULLARD IS KEPT OUT 
ACROBATICALLY FLINGING HIMSELF TO 
HIS RIGHT A PENALTY TO FULHAM ERIK NEVLAND 
WAS PULLED DOWN SUN JIHAI IS 
PENALISED FOR PULLING DOWN THE 
NORWEGIAN BUT DID HE THEY GOT 
TANGLED UP TOGETHER BUT NINETEEN WAS 
POINTED AT THE PENALTY SPOT AND JOE HART SAVED IT BUT COULD NOT 
SAVE THE FOLLOW UP IT IS TO DO TOO 
SUDDENLY FROM NOTHING FULHAM ARE IN 
THE MATCH IT IS TO TWO GOALS 
EACH NOT OVER YET FOR ROY HODGSON'S TEAM JIMMY BULLARD WENT FOR GOAL HE STEADIED HIMSELF JUST BRUSHING 
THE TOP OF THE CROSSBAR ROY 
HODGSON COLLAPSING IN A NERVOUS 
HE'D HEAP KASEY KELLER HAS KEPT IT OUT ONE 
HANDED AN AMAZING RUN BY MARTIN 
PETROV CAMERA HE HAS GAUD A WONDERFUL 
WONDERFUL GOAL FOR FULHAM 
DIOMANSY KAMARA HE HAS SCORED IT 
IS DEFINITELY ON FOR THEM THEY 
HAVE COME FROM TRAILING MANCHESTER 
CITY TWO TO ZERO WITH THREE GOALS IN THE 
LAST TWENTY MINUTES OF THE MATCH WHAT 
A GREAT BALL INSIDE THE DEFENDER L. 
HAVE TO SAY IT WAS HALF HEARTED 
DEFENDING WASN'T IT BUT THE 
FINISH WAS EXQUISITE HAVE YOU EVER 
EXPERIENCED A GAME LIKE THAT I I SUPPOSE I HAVE BUT I CANNOT RECALL 
IT IT WAS A SPLENDID VICTORY FOR 
US AND ONE THAT WE SO BADLY NEEDED 
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A WIN TODAY NO 
DOUBT ABOUT IT BUT WE DID NOT SO 
WE HAVE TO WORK AND WE HAVE TO DO 
SOMETHING BECAUSE A BIG BIG 
TEAM DOES NOT LOSE A GAME LIKE THIS 
AND WE DID 
DO YOU NOT THINK 
MANCHESTER CITY ARE A BIG BIG 
TEAM 
IF YOU WANT TO REACH THE TEAM CHAMPIONS LEAGUE AND THE PREMIER 
TEAM YOU CANNOT LOSE GAMES LIKE 
THAT TOO EASY 
TODAY EVERYBODY 
PLAYED VERY GOOD L. AM HAPPY FOR 
THE SEASON L. AM HAPPY THAT FULHAM 
STAY IN THE PREMIERSHIP WITH THOSE 
TWO GOALS 
NOW WE GIVE OURSELVES A 
CHANCE DENIED A VICTORY AT 
BIRMINGHAM SEND US TO PORTSMOUTH 
IN THE LAST GAME AND IT GOES DOWN 
TO THE WIRE TWO OF THREE MATCHES 
AGO I THINK I WOULD HAVE SETTLED 
FOR THAT MORE THAN HAPPILY 
JUST AS 
YOU THOUGHT FULHAM WERE DOWN AND 
OUT THEY PRODUCED THE MOST UNLIKELY 
COMEBACK 
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE THE COMEBACK SECOND SUCCESSIVE AWAY VICTORY IN 
THIRTY ODD GAMES SO AND YET FOR SO 
LONG IN THE GAME IT WAS SO EASY FOR 
MANCHESTER CITY TO BE TWO TO ZERO UP THEY 
HAVE PROBLEMS DEFENSIVELY THE FOUR 
PLAYERS APPEARED TO BE IN THE WRONG 
POSITION FULHAM TOOK TOTAL THE 
ADVANTAGE OF THAT IT IS ALWAYS A 
QUESTION OF HOW SOON YOU CAN GET 
YOUR FIRST GOAL WHEN YOU WATCH 
THIS FROM CITY'S POINT OF VIEW 
DIOMANSY KAMARA DOES VERY WELL BUT 
STILL CITY SHOULD HAVE STOPPED HIM 
THEN THEY GET THE SOFT PENALTY 
GOOD SAVE BY JOE HART DANNY MURPHY 
CANNOT BELIEVE HIS LUCK TO GET TWO 
ONLY ONE TEAM WAS GOING TO WIN THE 
GAME FROM THERE THIS IS CITY AT 
HOME AGAINST A RAMPANT FULHAM WHY 
IS ELANO PLAYING RIGHT BACK THEN 
DEMANDS GAVE KAMARA MADE IT THREE TO TWO 
WHAT AN EFFORT DIOMANSY KAMARA 
WE SAW THEM AT HOVE AGAINST 
LIVERPOOL AND WE THOUGHT THEY WERE 
DOWN BUT THEY CAME BACK WITH A 
GREAT PERFORMANCE HE HAS BEEN 
MOANING BUT IN HIS DEFENCE SVEN 
GORAN ERIKSSON THE DAY 
DEFENSIVELY 
IN HIS 
DEFENCE HIS DEFENSIVELY DEFENCE WAS NOT VERY GOOD 
ELANO IS 
A MIDFIELD PLAYER PLAYING RIGHT 
BACK APART FROM ALL OF THOSE 
PROBLEMS THEY WERE FINE 
AS FOR 
CITY A SEASON OF TWO HEART YES YES BUT I STILL THINK THEY WILL FINISH 
IN THE TOP TEN 
TWO HALVES L. I STILL BELIEVE THAT FINISHING TOP TEN 
IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE IS A GOOD 
SEASON FOR ANYBODY 
A BRILLIANT 
COMEBACK FOR FULHAM BIRMINGHAM 
CITY AFTER WINNING JUST ONE OF 
THEIR SEVEN LEAGUE GAMES HAVE 
DROPPED INTO THE BOTTOM THREE THEY 
FACE A LIVERPOOL SIDE WITH MORE 
THAN HALF THE NIGHT ON THEIR 
FORTHCOMING CHAMPIONS LEAGUE MATCH 
HALF AN EYE MAIK TAYLOR HAS PLAYED IN THE LAST 
FIVE PREMIER LEAGUE MATCHES AGAINST 
LIVERPOOL AND HAS YET TO BE ON THE 
LOSING SIDE JERMAINE PENNANT'S RETURN IS ONE OF 
NINE CHANGES MADE BY WILL STOP AND 
HE WAS IN THE BIRMINGHAM SIDE THAT 
FAILED TO AVOID RELEGATION TWO 
YEARS AGO CHANGES MADE BY RAFAEL BENITEZ MIKAEL FORSSELL AND SOME QUALITY TO THE BIRMINGHAM SIDE WHEN BURNING AND GET HOLD OF THEY 
CAN KNOCK THE BALL ABOUT QUITE WELL 
AT TIMES BIRMINGHAM CLEVER PLAY BY OLIVIER KAPO JUST TOO FAR AHEAD BY ANYBODY THAT 
COULD HAVE MADE CONTACT HE JUST 
ABOUT BISECTED HIS OWN THREE 
ATTACKERS WITH THAT CROSS MIKAEL FORSSELL HE PUTS BIRMINGHAM 
IN FRONT IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE WAY 
THAT MCFADYEN TEASED JOHN ARNE 
RIISE MIKAEL FORSSELL BACK IN THE 
STARTING LINE UP IS ALEX MCLEISH A 
REAL BOOST WHEN JAMES MCFADDEN 
GETS ON THE BALL YOU REALLY FEEL 
THAT BIRMINGHAM HAVE GOT CHANCES 
HE IS TEASING JOHN ARNE RIISE MIKAEL FORSSELL BURIED IT THAT IS THE CO OWNER AND PRESIDENT 
DAVID SULLIVAN PLENTY TO THINK 
ABOUT IN RECENT WEEKS PETER CROUCH TOOK AN EARLY SHOT MAIK TAYLOR TOOK NO CHANCES MAIK TAYLOR PROBABLY MADE THE RIGHT DECISION FOUL BY MURPHY A DANGEROUS 
POSITION IN WHICH TO CONCEDE A FREE 
KICK RIGHT ON HALF TIME A YELLOW 
CARD FOR MURPHY JOHN ARNE RIISE WAS NOT FAR AWAY 
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE PERFECT 
RIPOSTE TO THE OWN GOAL AGAINST 
CHELSEA HE WAS LAST ACTION HERO OF 
THE FIRST HALF AT SAINT ANDREWS A OLIVIER KAPO TO THE LEFT OF JAMES 
MCFADDEN A VERY GOOD POSITION FOR 
BIRMINGHAM AND TELL THAT FOUL ON 
JAMES MCFADDEN BY MARTIN 
JAMES MCFADDEN BY MARTIN SKRTEL UNTIL I'M SURPRISED HE HAS NOT GOT 
A RED CARD IS HE MAKING SIGNS THAT THE 
GOALKEEPER SOME PLAYERS HAVE IN 
THIS SITUATION WOULD HE BE 
INTERFERING IF HE DID HE IS GOING TO DO THAT SEBASTIAN 
LARSSON SCORES BEAUTIFULLY TAKEN 
BY SEBASTIAN LARSSON BUT WOULD 
PEPE REINA COMPLAIN ABOUT READY 
JAIDEE'S BEHAVIOUR NOT WANTING TO 
TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM THAT FREE 
KICK RADHI JAIDI DID THAT 
DISTURB THE CONCENTRATION OF PEPE 
REINA SEBASTIAN LARSSON GOT REAL 
BENT ON THAT AND IT FINISHED UP 
RIGHT IN THE CORNER EVEN THOUGH 
PEPE REINA WAS GOING THE RIGHT WAY 
ONLY A FREE KICK BECAUSE BIRMINGHAM 
WERE DEPRIVED OF A GOALSCORING 
SITUATION CROUCH LIVERPOOL ARE BACK IN IT 
PETER CROUCH SEIZING THE 
OPPORTUNITY NOW WE HAVE A 
DIFFERENT GAME JUST WHEN BIRMINGHAM APPEARED TO 
TAKE A HOLD ON A MATCH LIVERPOOL 
PRODUCED THEIR BEST ATTACK OF THE 
GAME IT IS DOWN TO THE EX 
BIRMINGHAM AND JERMAINE PENNANT HE 
CARRIED THAT FOR A LONG WAY FROM 
THE RIGHT POSITION PETER CROUCH 
WAS JUST AHEAD HE PLAYED IT IN AND 
PETER CROUCH FINISHED FIRST TIME SEVERAL MALES WILL BE BITTEN HERE 
IN THE REMAINING TWENTY MINUTES 
NAILS ANDRIY VORONIN SHOOTS IT COULD SO EASILY HAVE BEEN ANOTHER GOAL IT IS IN WITH THE DEFLECTION IT IS TWO TO TWO 
TAYLOR HAS NO CHANCE HERE GOES 
OFF BACK TO SEND THE GOALKEEPER THE 
WRONG WAY 
I GOT A GREAT REACTION 
FROM THE PLAYERS FROM LAST WEEK IT 
WAS GREAT TREMENDOUS STRENGTH AND 
DETERMINATION BY THE TEAM TODAY 
THEY JUST RAN OUT OF LEGS 
SOMETIMES WE HAVE STRUGGLED TO GET 
TWO TO ZERO TODAY WE DID IT BUT WE LET 
THEM BACK IN A TERRIBLE GOAL FROM 
MY POINT OF VIEW 
THERE IS SORT OF 
TWO LIVERPOOL TEAMS WHICH ONE DO 
YOU BELONG TO 
HOPEFULLY I BELONG 
TO BOTH A SIDE THAT IS GOOD ENOUGH 
TO BEAT ANYONE ON THE DAY THE THE SECOND GOAL OF THE GAME WAS CURIOUS 
WHAT WAS YOUR READING OF IT THE THE OFFSIDE RULE IS SOMETHING THAT THEY 
HAVE TO CHANGE NOW BECAUSE IF YOU 
HAVE A PLAYER IN FRONT OF 
KEEPER THEN THIS PLAYER HAS 
INFLUENCE ON THE PLAY THIS IS 
SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE CLARIFIED 
ANOTHER TERRIFIC COMEBACK FROM 
LIVERPOOL IT COULD PROVE COSTLY 
FOR BIRMINGHAM 
YES BUT IF YOU HAD 
SAID TO ALEX MCLEISH AT THE START 
OF THE GAME HE COULD HAVE HAD A 
POINT HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT IN 
FAIRNESS TO LIVERPOOL EIGHT AND 
NINE CHANGES SINCE THE TEAM THE 
OTHER NIGHT AND THEY CAME BACK 
TURNED INTO A GOOD GAME WE HAVE TO 
COME BACK TO THE POINT ABOUT THE 
FREE KICK FROM WHICH LARSSON SCORED 
IF YOU LOOK AT IT JAIDI HAS GOT TO 
BE SEEKING TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE WE 
HAVE CIRCLED HIM THE REFEREE CAN 
SEE WHAT HE IS DOING YOU'RE YOU'RE OFFSIDE IF IN THE OPINION OF THE 
REFEREE YOU'RE INVOLVED IN ACTIVE 
PLAY BARGAINING AN ADVANTAGE 
GUILTY ON BOTH CHARGES 
OF COURSE 
THE GOALKEEPER CANNOT SEE THIS WAS 
THE GAME AGAINST EVERTON L. KNOW HE 
IS NOT OFFSIDE BUT VERY SOON THE 
LAW HAS TO BE CHANGED 
THE PROBLEM 
IS THAT YOU TO DO NOT UNDERSTAND 
THAT LAW 
I UNDERSTAND IT PERFECTLY 
I THINK IT IS MISUNDERSTOOD BY THE 
ODD PERSON 
IF YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF 
DAYS CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT TO ME 
WHAT ABOUT THE ROTATION SYSTEM IT 
IS WORKING 
YES AND THAT IS GOOD 
NEWS FOR LIVERPOOL IF YOU'RE GOING 
TO DO WELL YOU HAVE TO REPLACE 
QUALITY WITH QUALITY CHELSEA AND 
MAN UNITED HAVE SHOWN THAT IS 
IMPERATIVE IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR 
LIVERPOOL TO TAKE SOMETHING OUT OF 
TODAY'S GAME GOING INTO THE BIG 
GAME ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
WE WILL 
TAKE A FEW MINUTES FOR YOU TO 
EXPLAIN THE OFFSIDE LAW 
WE WILL 
MOVE ON TO THE NEXT GAME 
BIRMINGHAM NEXT WEEK THAT IS A BIG 
ONE 
WE WILL SEE READING AT WIGAN ONE BUT FIRST BOLTON WERE 
LOOKING TO 
CONTINUE THEIR BID TO ESCAPE 
RELEGATION THE CROATIAN INTERNATIONAL SET TO 
JOIN TOTTENHAM FOR FIFTEEN MILLION WAS 
IN THE CROWD TODAY JONATHAN 
WOODGATE RETURNS AFTER INJURY NOT A BAD EFFORT ANOTHER GOOD 
SEASON FOR ROBBIE KEANE TWENTY TWO GOALS 
IN TOTAL BOLTON ARE MAKING A 
CHANGE O'BRIEN HAS BARELY LASTED TWENTY MINUTES WHAT A FEISTY SHOT THAT WAS FROM 
THE BRAZILIAN MEGSON KNOWS HIS 
TEAM HAVE TO GET SOMETHING HERE 
THEY HAVE SUNDERLAND AT HOME NEXT 
WEEK AND FINISH UP AT CHELSEA FREE KICK RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THE PENALTY AREA IT IS OFF THE POST ROBBIE KEANE SO 
CLOSE TO GIVING TOTTENHAM THE LEAD 
I AM NOT SURE IT WAS OFF KEANE 
BOLON ARE MAKING A CHANGE HUTTON 
IS COMING OFF BOLTON TOTTENHAM 
ARE MAKING A CHANGE HUTTON CAME 
OUT AND TOOK HIS PLACE FOR THE 
SECOND HALF ONLY TO BE REPLACED GIANNAKOPOULOS WITH HIS FIRST TOUCH 
JUST TWENTY SECONDS AFTER COMING ON AS 
A SUBSTITUTE GIVES BOLTON A HIGHLY 
UNLIKELY LEAD THE DOUBLE SWAP BOTH INVOLVED IN 
THE GOAL IN THE LAST TWO MATCHES 
ONE TO ZERO HAS BEEN ENOUGH WILL IT BE 
ENOUGH FOR THE THIRD MATCH IN A 
ROW HE SUDDENLY LOOKS LIKE A GENIUS AFTER THOSE TWO CHANGES ONE TO ONE TOTTENHAM BACK IN THE MATCH 
BOLTON'S LEAD DID NOT LAST LONG 
MALBRANQUE THE MAN WHO EQUALISED 
FOR SPURS GREAT RUNNING BY MALBRANQUE HE 
DESERVED A GOAL THERE LOOK AT THE 
RUN ON THE FAR SIDE BY MALBRANQUE GOOD TACKLE BY SAMUEL FOUR MINUTES LEFT OFF THE LINE BY GUTHRIE THAT WAS A GREAT CHANCE TO WIN IT RIGHT AT THE END 
WE ARE WHERE WE ARE WE HAVE 
TO TO DEAL WITH IT WE DID NOT PLAY 
PARTICULARLY WELL BUT IT IS NOT 
BAD RESULT FOR US 
I THINK WE 
PLAYED GOOD FOOTBALL TODAY WE WERE 
GOOD ON THE BALL AND CREATING 
CHANCES 
WE PUT THEM UNDER PRESSURE CHANCES AND WE MADE THE TWO SUBSTITUTIONS 
AND MANAGED TO GET OUT WEIGHED 
OUT WIDE THERE WAS A BIT OF A MIX 
UP TO PUT IT IN THE NET JUST A BIT 
GUTTED THAT WE LOST THE GOAL SO 
EARLY AFTER SCORING 
A VERY 
EXCITING ACQUISITION FOR YOU 
HOPEFULLY HAVE HIM READY FOR PRE 
SEASON EVERYTHING IS STILL GOING 
THROUGH IT IS GOING TO BE GREAT 
PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY WOULD 
HAVE LOOKED AT US AND THOUGHT WE 
WERE GONE AND WE HAVE COME OUT 
WITH 
FOUR POINTS 
NOW WE HAVE A 
HUGE GAME STEVE COPPELL MADE SIX CHANGES LAST 
WEEKEND AND ARSENAL JUST HAVE FIVE 
TODAY LITA STARTS AFTER HIS RECALL 
FROM A LOAN SPELL DEWBERRY AND 
SHOREY INTO DEFENCE HALF A DOZEN 
WIGAN PLAYERS JUST INSIDE THE 
PENALTY AREA OFF THE POST AND AWAY MARCUS BENT 
WITH THE HEADER HE WAS SO CLOSE TO 
GETTING THE OPENING GOAL OF THE 
AFTERNOON BENT HAD TWO READING 
PLAYERS MARKING HIM THERE AND THEY 
ALLOWED HIM A VIRTUAL FREE HEADER NOT A BAD EFFORT FROM WILSON PALACIOS DECENT BALL IN THAT'S AN EXCELLENT STOP FROM 
MARKUS HAHNEMANN READING ALMOST 
THE ARCHITECT OF THEIR OWN DOWNFALL 
THERE POOR DISTRIBUTION FROM DEFENCE AND 
BROWN LETS GO WITH A FIZZLER EMILE 
HESKEY LOOKING FOR HIS THIRD GOAL 
IN AS MANY GAMES THAT HEADER 
WASN'T TOO FAR OVER EITHER WHAT 
CAN HARPER DO HERE RIGHT ACROSS THE GOAL FROM LEROY 
LITA HE ALMOST SQUEEZED IT IN 
WHAT A MAGNIFICENT PIECE OF 
INDIVIDUAL PLAY FROM LEROY LITA IT 
ALMOST KILLED IN THE TIGHTEST OF 
ANGLES TRISH MACRO CURLED MARKUS TANNER AND HAD 
TO SCRAMBLE TO GET THAT CLEAR HE WAS WRONG 
FOOTED MARKUS HAHNEMANN HE JUST 
DID REALLY WELL HE HAS TASTED RELEGATION BEFORE 
WITH CRYSTAL PALACE AND DOES NOT 
WANT TO TASTE IT BEGAN WHAT A CHANCE THAT WAS FOR READING 
CHRIS KIRKLAND GREAT FOR TO GRAB 
THE BALL MICHAEL DUBERRY WITH A 
HEADER BUT CHRIS KIRKLAND PLUCKED 
IT OUT OF THE AIR WHAT A GOOD BLOCK THAT WAS FROM TAYLOR THAT PASS FROM JAMES HARPER IS 
MAGNIFICENT AND TERRIFIC DEFENDING 
FROM TAYLOR TO DENY THEM MARLON KING WENT FOR GOAL BUT 
MARKUS HAHNEMANN SAVE IT NOT FOR 
THE FIRST TIME KEEPING HIS TEAM IN 
THIS MATCH THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
NO WAY BACK AT THIS LATE STAGE FOR 
READING READING ONCE 
THE INITIAL FIFTEEN MINUTES 
OUT OF THE WAY I FELT THAT WE WERE 
GETTING MORE AND MORE ON TOP WE 
HAD A FEW THINGS FLASHING ACROSS 
THE GOAL MAYBE LIKE THE BELIEF AT 
THE MOMENT BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT BEEN 
SCORING GOALS 
THE BIG RESULT IS 
NOT TO BE BEATEN WHICH IS 
IMPERATIVE NOW WE HAVE TO WIN 
BACK TO BACK GAMES THAT IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE IS VERY DIFFICULT 
WE HAVE AN OUTSIDE CHANCE 
AT THIS 
STAGE IN THE SEASON I THINK IT IS A 
POINT AGAIN IT MEANS WE HAVE GOT 
OUR DESTINY IN OUR OWN HANDS WHICH 
IS REALLY GIVE FOR US 
A USEFUL AWAY POINT FOR READING BUT 
NOT THE BEST OF GAMES IN THE WORLD 
THE SAME FOR BOLTON BUT TO BE 
HONEST I AM NOT SURE HOW MASSIVE MASSIVE FOR BOLTON L. L. THOUGHT THAT THE 
POSSESSION STATISTICS WOULD BE A 
NINETY TO TEN IN FACT IT IS SIXTY EIGHT TO THIRTY TWO TOTTENHAM HAD FIVE GREAT CHANCES 
THE FIRST ONE PLAYED DOWN THE RIGHT 
HAND SIDE ROBBIE KEANE GOT A GREAT 
BALL ONTO MALBRANQUE HE SHOULD 
HAVE SCORED THEN THIS BRILLIANT 
FREE KICK HE SERVED EVERYBODY IN 
WHAT A CHANCE THAT IS FOR A PLAYER 
OF HIS STATURE HE CANNOT BELIEVE 
THAT HE MISSED THAT THEN SOME 
GREAT PLAY AGAIN DOWN THE RIGHT 
HAND SIDE IT IS QUICK AND INCISIVE INTO 
BERBATOV NOT GREAT BUT A GOOD SAVE 
BY THE KEEPER THEN DARREN BENT 
CAME ON HE MISJUDGED THAT HE 
SHOULD HAVE SCORED THEN THE BEST 
FOR LAST BERBATOV AGAIN AND HE 
CANNOT BELIEVE THAT HE HAS MISSED 
IT WE HAVE SHOWN YOU THE FIVE 
CHANCES BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO GIVE 
BORN A LOT OF CREDIT THEY HAVE 
SHOWN A LOT OF CHARACTER TO GET 
SIX POINT AND GATED BOTTOM THEM AND 
GET A POINT IS GREAT GO TO 
BOLTON AND GET A POINT IS GREAT 
TWO GAMES TO GO BOTH BELTERS OUR 
PENULTIMATE GAME SEES TWO NORTH 
EAST SIDES THAT CANNOT AFFORD TO 
RELAX JUST YET SUNDERLAND AGAINST 
MIDDLESBROUGH AT THE RIVERSIDE 
WATCHED BY STEVE WILSON 
MICHAEL CHOPRA RETURNS FOR 
SUNDERLAND THEIR GAME WHICH THE 
HOME SIDE DARE NOT LOSE SCHWARTZER 
IS STILL MISSING BRAD JONES IS IN 
HIS FIRST GOAL POSITION OF THE 
SEASON JULIO ARCA MAKES HIS RETURN 
TO THE STADIUM OF LIGHT MIDDLESBROUGH HAVE A DESERVED LEAD 
AFTER FOUR MINUTES THE PRESSURE IS 
ON SUNDERLAND NOW AFONSO ALVES HAS 
JUST LOFTED IT OVER THE TOP OF THE 
SUNDERLAND BACK LINE ALL OF THEM 
WERE BEATEN BY THE ONE THROUGH BALL 
NOT TOO MANY INSIDE THE STADIUM OF 
LIGHT BANKING ON THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
NEXT YEAR BUT THEY COULD BE IN FOR 
AN EQUALISER CHOPRA DEFLECTED OVER THE TOP OF THE BAR 
BY TAYLOR WHAT AN ELECTRIFYING 
MINUTE OR SO AT THE STADIUM OF 
LIGHT WHAT A CHANCE IT WAS JONES DID WELL AND CHOPRA COULD NOT BEAT HIM THAT HEADING HIS OWN WHAT A 
MAGNIFICENT RESPONSE THAT HAD IT 
IS IN DANNY HIGGINBOTHAM FOR 
SUNDERLAND THEY WERE BEHIND FOR NINETY 
SECONDS MARK THE START TO THE 
DERBY LESS THAN SIX MINUTES PLAYED 
AND 
IT IS ONE ALL DANNY HIGGINBOTHAM GOT HIS HEAD ON IT AND BRAD JONES DID NOT STAND 
CHANCE A GREAT HEADER BY DANNY 
HIGGINBOTHAM MICHAEL CHOPRA ONSIDE THE KEEPER HESITATED A REALLY GOOD RUN FROM MICHAEL 
CHOPRA THAT IS HOW YOU SHOULD TIME 
IT RUNNING ALONG THE LINE AND THEN 
HE BREAKS AS THE BALL IS DELIVERED 
UNLUCKY NOT TO PUT SUNDERLAND IN 
FRONT HE IS A PICTURE OF BUT DO 
NOT TRUST THOSE STEELY EYES CALM HE IS COMPLAINING THAT HE DID NOT 
GET THE FREE KICK FOR THAT 
CHALLENGE WHICH LEFT HIM WITH BLOOD 
STREAMING FROM HIS NOSE THERE IT 
IS RIGHT INTO HIS FACE HE WILL 
NEED A NEW SHIRT THAT SCORELINE 
MIGHT SUIT BOTH MANAGERS BOTH HAVE 
LOOKED VULNERABLE DEFENSIVELY AND NICE BALL IN FROM STEWART 
DOWNING AND THAT HEADER IT'S ONLY 
JUST WIDE MIDDLESBROUGH STARTED STRONGER AND 
SCORED AND MIDDLESBROUGH ARE 
FINISHING SLIGHTLY STRONGER CHOPRA IT IS IN SUNDERLAND TWO MIDDLESBROUGH ONE 
MICHAEL CHOPRA WITH THAT GOAL 
ONSIDE HERE WELL TIMED RUN HE 
CERTAINLY WAS ONSIDE THEN HE WAS 
UP AGAINST DAVID WHEATER THERE 
HAVE BEEN BATTLING ALL THERE AND HE 
BEAT HIM A NERVOUS SPLIT SECOND AS 
IT HIT THE BAR BUT IT DROPPED 
BEHIND THE LINE SUNDERLAND LEAD 
MIDDLESBROUGH DAVID WHEATER TRIED TO DEAL WITH 
JONES BUT HE HAS NOT AND HE GETS 
AWAY A GOOD SAVE KENWYNE JONES 
MIGHT HAVE PUT THE GAME BEYOND THE 
OLD BORO THERE BUT THE GOALKEEPER 
DID WELL IT IS NOT SOME HOLIDAYS YET FOR 
MIDDLESBROUGH SUMMER A GREAT SAVE BRAD JONES FOR MIDDLESBROUGH A GOOD BALL IN BY 
CHOPRA A GREAT SAVE WITH THAT 
REACTION FROM HIS LEFT HAND MIDDLESBROUGH ARE SO CLOSE DENIED 
TWICE IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE 
FIRST BY THE BLOCK AND THEN BY THE 
SAVE AFONSO ALVES IS ON SIDE AND HE HAS 
SCORED SUNDERLAND CANNOT BELIEVE 
THAT THE FLAG DID NOT GO UP BUT 
AFONSO ALVES HAS SCORED ONLY HIS 
THIRD GOAL OF THE SEASON WAS HE 
OFFSIDE IT WAS VERY CLOSE HE 
FORCED IT BEYOND THE KEEPER HE 
JUST HAD THE LEGS TO GET OVER THE 
LINE AN DRAW WOULD TAKE BOTH TEAMS TO THIRTY SEVEN IT IS HARD FOR SOMEBODY TO CO DOWN AT THIRTY SEVEN GO DOWN THE CORNER MIDDLESBROUGH ARE STILL WITH SOME 
DEFENDING TO DO GRANT LEADBITTER 
TAKES IT DID IT GO IN IT HAS BEEN GIVEN 
DARYL MURPHY SUNDERLAND GET ONE IN 
ADDED TIME DARYL MURPHY'S HEADER 
HAS GOT THAN THE POINTS THAT MEANS 
SAFETY THE NINETY SECOND MINUTE OF THE GAME 
AND THE SUBSTITUTE STRIKES 
SUNDERLAND ARE SAFE CLEARLY OVER 
THE LINE AS IT CAME DOWN OFF THE 
BAR MIDDLE SPARROW WILL HAVE TO 
LIVE ON THEIR NERVES FOR ANOTHER 
WEEK AT LEAST MIDDLESBROUGH 
HE SCORED THE GOAL WHICH KEEPS 
SUNDERLAND UP 
THANK YOU L. THINK 
THEY HAVE GIVEN IT TO EMANUEL 
POGATETZ BUT I DEFINITELY GOT THE 
CHANCE ON IT IT WENT IN 
A CRUEL 
BLOW TODAY TO LOSE SO LATE ON 
HAVING GIVEN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING 
IS PAINFUL IT IS PAINFUL FOR OUR 
FANS AND FOR THE PLAYERS BUT WE 
HAVE TO LIFT OURSELVES 
WE HAVE 
LOST THE LAST COUPLE OF GAMES L. 
THOUGHT IT WAS A CRACKING GAME 
TODAY WE HAVE GIVEN SOME BAD GOALS 
AWAIT AND WE SCORED SOME GOOD GOALS 
AND THEN WE GOT A GREAT ONE IN 
INJURY TIME CREDIT TO THE PLAYERS 
WERE TOP I AM NOT GOING TO TEAR MY 
PLAYERS APART BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD 
ANY NUMBER OF NOT BAGS EVERYBODY EVERYBODY WANTS TO HAVE A DIG AT PORT OF US 
KNOCK BACKS YET ANOTHER LATE GOAL FOR 
SUNDERLAND WE HAVE SAID THAT FEW 
TIMES THIS SEASON 
WE HAVE SEEN IT 
MANY TIMES AND YOU ARE GOING TO SEE 
IT AGAIN BECAUSE WE HAVE A GRAPHIC 
HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS LOOK AT THAT NINE POINTS GAINED I 
THINK THEY HAVE GOT THIRTY AT HOME AS 
WELL 
ROY KEANE HAS KEPT HIS CALM WELL AND DONE A GOOD JOB 
YES THEY ARE 
FIT AND THEY KEEP GOING UNTIL THE 
LAST MINUTE AS WELL WE ARE NOT 
QUITE SURE WHO SCORED HIS GOAL BUT 
IT WAS VERY LATE THEY HAVE GIVEN 
IT TO EMANUEL POGATETZ BUT DARYL 
MURPHY HAD TO SHOUT FOR IT AS WELL 
IT IS SO IMPORTANT WHEN YOU SEE 
TEAMS SCORE SO LATE SO OFTEN IT HAS 
TOO MANY THINGS THAT THEY HAVE 
GREAT BELIEF AS MUCH AS ANYTHING 
THAT HAS BEEN THE THING FOR 
SUNDERLAND 
IT IS LOOKING SUNDERLAND EXCEPTIONALLY TIGHT AT THE BOTTOM 
IT IS JUST INCREDIBLE WHEN YOU 
LOOK AT THE FIXTURES AS WELL WE 
THOUGHT FOR LOVE AND DERBY HAVE 
GONE A WEEK OR TWO AGO AND THEY 
HAVE COME UP WITH THE RESULTS 
FULHAM AND DERBY READING ARE IN 
THERE AS WELL WITH TERRIBLE GOAL 
DIFFERENCE BUT LOOK AT THE 
FIXTURES THE STAND OUT GAME NEXT 
WEEK IS BIRMINGHAM AND FULHAM 
ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE AND IT KEEPS IT 
INTERESTING THAT THE TOP AND THE 
BOTTOM EVERY TIME YOU THINK THAT 
FULHAM ARE DOWN THEY COME BACK AND 
GIVE YOU AN ANSWER TO THE CRITICS 
TODAY WAS PRIME EXAMPLE THEY 
WERE DOWN AT ONE STAGE AND THEY 
CAME BACK AND SCORED THREE IN THE 
LAST TWENTY MINUTES 
A GENTLE REMINDER 
TO WATCH MATCH OF THE DAY TO 
TOMORROW 
FOR THE FIRST TIME AND A. V. C. SCHEME 
WILL BENEFIT IVAN GASKELL HAS BEEN 
TO TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR COMMUNITY 
SPORTS CENTRE TO FIND OUT MORE 
MANY YOUNGSTERS DREAM OF JOINING A 
KICKABOUT WITH A PREMIER LEAGUE 
FOOTBALLER FOR A LUCKY FEW IT 
ACTUALLY CAME TRUE THIS WEEK 
DARREN BENT JOINED A CELEBRATION OF 
THE WHITE HEART LANE SPACES FOR 
SPORT SCHEME AND THE LAUNCH OF 
FIRST OF THESE SIDES OUTSIDE THE U. K. 
WHEN I WAS YOUNG THERE WAS NOT 
ANYTHING LIKE THIS MY DAD TOOK ME 
TO MAKE CLAY PITCH IF HE FELL OVER 
IT USED TO KILL YOU FOR THESE KIDS 
COMMIT IT IS FANTASTIC 
WHAT YOU 
LIKE ABOUT THIS PLACE FOR THESE 
KIDS I THINK IT IS VERY GREAT 
LOTS OF PEOPLE WANT TO ENJOY IT IT 
IS REALLY FUN AND IT IS REALLY GOOD 
FOR KIDS AND ADULTS 
I LIKE IT 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE GOT TO DO 
DIFFERENT THINGS YOU DO NOT JUST 
THE ONE THING L. LIKE THE FOOTBALL THE BEST THEY HAVE 
IT HAS BEEN 
EXTRAORDINARY WE HAVE SO MANY KIDS 
COMING IN SO MANY KIDS WE DID NOT 
THINK WE HAD IT IS A BONUS TO SEE 
THEM 
LAUNCHED THREE YEARS AGO THE THEM PROJECT HAS GROWN TO TWO HUNDRED SIDES IN 
THE U. K. TOTTENHAM'S FLAGSHIP SCHEME 
HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IT HAS BEEN 
USED TO EXPAND INTO SOUTH AFRICA 
WE HAVE BEEN TOLD HAVE TO MAKE TO 
THE ELEMENTAL PROGRAMMES WORKED WE 
HAVE SHARED IDEAS 
ONE WOULD 
IMAGINE THAT CHILDREN IN SOUTH 
AFRICA WOULD HAVE VERY DIFFERENT 
PROBLEMS TO THOSE HE IN NORTH 
LONDON IS IT SO DIFFERENT THE THE ISSUES THEY FACE ARE STILL THE SAME 
IT IS ABOUT GETTING ACCESS TO 
SPORTING FACILITIES HOPEFULLY 
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER 
AND BE ABLE TO ACCESS A FACILITY 
WHICH IS LITERALLY ONE HUNDRED METRES FROM 
WHERE THEY ARE LIVING THEY WILL 
HAVE COACHES WORKING WITH THEM 
FROM HAVING VERY LITTLE THEY HAVE 
GOT A FULL AND PROPER FACILITY WITH 
A PROPER SERVICE THE QUALITY WILL 
BE MUCH BETTER 
THIS HAS BEEN A 
REALLY SUCCESSFUL PROJECT L. L. THINK 
YOU HAVE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WE WE WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA AND WHILE WE 
WERE OVER THERE IT WAS FANTASTIC 
PEOPLE WERE FRIENDLY WHEN WE 
TRAVELLED TWO GAMES WE SAW KIDS 
PLAYING ON CONCRETE PITCHES WHERE 
THEY COULD HURT THEMSELVES TO HAVE 
THIS OPEN THERE IS FANTASTIC IT 
WILL HELP LEAP HOPEFULLY PAID DEAN ASHTON IS BACK OR WEST HAM COULD GOAL A WONDERFUL STRIKE 
GOOD THAT IS AN EXCELLENT 
FIRST TIME HALF VOLLEY WEST HAM'S 
GOOD START HAS BEEN REWARDED WITH 
AN EARLY STRIKE IT LOOKS LIKE FREDDIE LJUNGBERG IS 
DOWN IN THE NEWCASTLE PENALTY AREA 
AT THE MOMENT STEVEN TAYLOR JUST 
LANDED ON HIM IT WOULD NOT BE 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON IN THE OFFICE IF 
ONE OF HIS 
PLAYERS HAD 
NOT GONE 
DOWN WITH AN INJURY WOULD IT FANTASTIC THAT IS WHY HE IS SO 
IMPORTANT TO THE WEST HAM UNITED 
TEAM LOOK HOW WELL ASHTON BIDES 
HIS TIME THROUGH THEIR LEGS OFF 
THE DEFENDER IT IS THE BOTTOM 
RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE NET GREAT CONTROL BY MARTINS NEWCASTLE 
ARE BACK IN IT PROBABLY THEIR 
FIRST SHOT ON GOAL IN THE FIRST 
HALF WATCH THE FIRST TOUCH 
TERRIFIC IT IS IN WHEN MARTIN'S'S SHOT CAME 
IN MAYBE A WEST HAM UNITED 
DEFENDER GOT THERE IT CAME OFF THE 
WEST HAM PLAYERS SHOULDER PLAYER'S A GREAT SAVE BY HARPER 
TERRIFIC FOOTBALL BY WEST HAM 
UNITED GREAT SAVE BY GREEN THAT WAS A 
TERRIFIC SHOT MARTINS IS TUSSLING 
STILL HERE IS THE THROUGH BALL IT 
STRUCK HIS ARM AGAIN 
WE PLAYED 
EVER SO WELL FOR FORTY MINUTES 
PERHAPS WE COULD HAVE BEEN FOUR UP 
YOU DO NEED TO GET IN THE DRESSING 
ROOM THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE OF 
SCORING THEY GOT TWO GOALS IN A 
COUPLE OF MINUTES AND TURNED THE 
GAME ON ITS HEAD 
ANOTHER GOAL AND 
SUDDENLY YOU THINK WE ARE UP TO DO 
AT HALF TIME WE HAVE NOT STARTED 
THE SECOND HALF WAS MORE EVEN L. L. 
THINK A DRAW WAS A FAIR RESULT THE THE NEWS ON FREDDIE LJUNGBERG IS THAT 
HE HAS BROKEN A RAPE AND COULD 
POSSIBLY MISSED THE EUROPEAN 
CHAMPIONSHIPS FOR SWEDEN RIP RIB 
CHELSEA ARE LEVEL ON POINTS WITH 
UNITED IT IS ENOUGH TO MAKE SIR 
ALEX FERGUSON DROP HIS GUN IF 
HISTORY IS ANYTHING TO GO BY HE 
WILL PICKETER GOODBYE PICK IT 
UP
