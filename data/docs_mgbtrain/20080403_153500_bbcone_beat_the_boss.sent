THE BIG SHOTS WITH OVER FIFTY FIVE YEARS' OF BUSINESS EXPERIENCE 
AND THE BRIGHT SPARKS WHO KNOW THE CHILDREN'S MARKET 
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM 
THE BATTLE IS ON TO WIN THE TROPHY TIME TO DELIVER THEIR BRIEF 
BIG SHOTS HELLO HELLO 
FEELING CONFIDENT WHATEVER THE CHALLENGE IS WE'LL BEAT THESE KIDS 
HELLO BRIGHT SPARKS I JUST HEARD THE WORD NERVOUS YEAH 
WHY I JUST WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT WE'RE DOING REALLY 
WHAT WOULD YOU LOVE THE BRIEF TO BE VIDEO GAMES TOYS 
SOMETHING GADGETY WHAT WOULD YOUR NIGHTMARE BRIEF BE SMALL ANIMALS 
SOMETHING TO DO WITH SCHOOL WHY 
I DON'T LIKE SCHOOL ARE YOU READY TO RECEIVE YOUR BRIEF BRING IT ON 
YEAH DEFINITELY 
YOUR TEAM MUST DESIGN AN OUT OF THIS WORLD TOY ROCKET 
IT MUST BE POWERED BY AIR OR WATER 
AND IT HAS TO SURVIVE MULTIPLE MISSIONS 
A TOY ROCKET WOW 
NOW YOU'VE HEARD THE BRIEF HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU YOU'LL WIN 
WE'VE GOT THREE GREAT MINDS SO WE CAN DEFINITELY DO THIS WE'RE OLDER 
WE'RE MORE INTELLIGENT WE SHOULD WIN THIS CHALLENGE 
A ROCKET IS SORT OF JUST MY THING I THINK IT'S A REALLY TOUGH CHALLENGE 
REALLY MUCH TOUGHER THAN I THOUGHT SO THAT'S THEIR MISSION 
OUR TEAMS HAVE TO THINK GALACTIC TO COME UP WITH A ROCKET 
TO BLAST AWAY THE COMPETITION 
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY AS THE TOY ROCKET MARKET IS SPECIALIST 
WORTH AN ESTIMATED TWENTY M. THE BIG SHOTS HAVE GONE BACK TO SCHOOL 
FOR A SCIENCE LESSON WHILST THE BRIGHT SPARKS ARE OFF TO SEE 
WHAT'S AVAILABLE ON PLANET EARTH 
SO THIS IS A HANDS ON LAUNCHING ROCKET SCIENCE KIT 
FOR THE FAMILY THE DESIGN SHOULD BE SOMETHING FUN AND INTERESTING 
AND BRIGHT COLOURED FOR BOTH GENDERS IF WE ADD LIGHTS AND SOUND 
IT MIGHT BE A BIT DIFFERENT THE BEST THING ABOUT WORKING WITH JACK 
IS HE LIKES GADGETS SO HE HAS A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS IT'S QUITE CLEVER 
IT'S GOT A PARACHUTE SO IT'LL LAND SAFELY WHAT IF IT BREAKS 
WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE IT IN STRONG MATERIAL IF WE DO USE A PARACHUTE 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS HAVE IGNITED THEIR IMAGINATIONS WHILST THE BIG SHOTS 
GET HANDS ON EXPERIENCE OF HOW ROCKETS WORK WITH PHYSICIST MATTHEW 
I NEED YOUR HELP HERE I ALWAYS ENJOYED SCHOOL AND ENJOYED SCIENCE 
SO IT'LL BE GOOD TO GO BACK AND MEET THE KIDS LET THE CLIP G. O. 
BLAST OFF THAT IS YOUR FIRST HOME MADE ROCKET 
I AM CONFIDENT WE'LL WIN BUT THIS RESEARCH BIT IS VERY IMPORTANT 
NOW THEY'RE UP TO SPEED MATTHEW PUTS THE CLASS INTO MAXIMUM THRUST 
AS HE DEMONSTRATES A GAS POWERED ROCKET 
WITH ALL THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WE'RE READY DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME 
AT THE NATIONAL SPACE CENTRE IN LEICESTER THE BRIGHT SPARKS 
ARE GETTING EXPERT HELP TOO FIRST UP ROCKET BUILDING WITH HANNAH 
WE'RE GOING TO BUILD ROCKETS LIKE THIS WE'LL PUT IN SPECIAL TABLETS 
THAT DISSOLVE IN WATER AND THEY PRODUCE A GAS 
IT WILL FILL THIS CANISTER BUT WHAT'LL HAPPEN 
IF THERE'S TOO MUCH GAS THERE IT'D EXPLODE IT WOULD POP THIS OFF 
WHICH WAY WILL THE ROCKET GO UP THAT'S RIGHT 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS GET TO WORK ON THEIR OWN ROCKETS AND GO OUTSIDE 
TO LAUNCH THEM WITH SPACE SCIENTIST JAMES FIVE FOUR THREE TWO ONE 
AND NOTHING HAPPENS 
THE ROCKETS WE MADE WERE DISAPPOINTING AS SOME DIDN'T GO OFF 
BUT WHEN THEY DID IT WAS FUN TO SEE THEM GO UP 
WITH THEIR FIRST LAUNCH SUCCESSFULLY BEHIND THEM 
THEY PROBE JAMES FOR MORE IDEAS WE WERE THINKING OF A PARACHUTE DESIGN 
DO YOU THINK THAT'D BE A GOOD IDEA IT'D BE A VERY GOOD IDEA 
WE LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING IT SPIN WHILE IT GOES UP COULD WE DO THAT 
IF YOU GET IT WRONG YOU MIGHT MAKE IT VERY UNSTABLE BUT IF IT'S RIGHT 
IT'LL GO A LONG WAY THE BIG SHOTS ARE TALKING TO SOME ENTHUSIASTS 
TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT YOU LIKE 
WOULD YOU WANT IT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE OR JUST GO UP AND COME DOWN 
WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE IF IT TOOK A PHOTO I DON'T LIKE THAT WHY NOT 
THE SORT OF THINGS THEY LIKE 
AND DON'T LIKE IS VERY DIFFERENT TO WHAT I IMAGINED IT WOULD BE 
IF IT SHOT OUT CONFETTI THEY'D THOUGHT ABOUT CAMERAS 
BUT I THINK THEY WANT ONE THAT LOOKS 
AS REALISTIC AND GOES AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE IF IT WAS TWICE THIS BIG 
HAD A SHUTTLE ON IT AND THE ROCKET CAME DOWN ON A PARACHUTE 
AND IT GLIDED DOWN HOW WOULD THAT BE I WOULD BUY THAT 
WITH ALL THE INFORMATION ON BOARD 
THEY SET TO WORK ON THE FINAL FRONTIER OF THEIR MARKET RESEARCH 
WOULD THEY WORK BY AIR OR WATER 
BOTH TEAMS HAVE ROCKETED THROUGH THEIR MARKET RESEARCH 
BUT NOW IT'S FULL THROTTLE TIME FOR THE BRAINSTORM 
SO BY AIR OR WATER I THOUGHT WE SHOULD USE AIR SO DO I 
SHALL WE DIVIDE IT UP INTO A FEW AREAS DESIGN TECHNOLOGY 
AND MAYBE DO THE NAME AT THE END YES GOOD IDEA 
DO WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT WITH DESIGN BEFORE WE COME TO THAT 
WHAT ELSE WOULD THIS ROCKET DO 
WILFRED'S THE MOST DOMINANT FIGURE WITHIN OUR TEAM 
I DON'T FANCY THE PARACHUTE IDEA THE MULTI USE OF IT 
IT'LL BE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO LAST LONGER IF ON A PARACHUTE 
WHAT ABOUT SOUND ADD SOUND WHEN IT COMES DOWN MAKE IT WHISTLE 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE IT'S BEEN DONE 
ONCE IT'S IN THE AIR IT COULD LET DOWN SOME CONFETTI OR SOMETHING 
OR ADD SOME STREAMERS AS WELL COMING DOWN GOOD IDEA 
SO STREAMERS THE BRIGHT SPARKS ARE FLYING THROUGH THEIR IDEAS 
WHEREAS THE BIG SHOTS CAN'T AGREE ON ONE WHAT ABOUT THE SHUTTLE 
IT'S STILL AN ORDINARY ROCKET TO ME THE OTHER THING THAT BOTHERS ME 
IS THAT TWO THINGS HAVE TO COME BACK TO EARTH THAT THEY HAVE TO FIND 
IS IT MORE FUN IS IT OR MORE HASSLE 
A LOT OF DIFFERENT IDEAS WERE THROWN AROUND BUT THERE'S NOTHING 
LIKE PRESSURE TO FOCUS THE MIND AND GET ON WITH WHAT'S IMPORTANT 
WITH THE PRESSURE ON THEY MAKE 
SOME PAPER AEROPLANES TO GET THEIR INITIAL ROCKET SHAPE STARTED 
THAT'S THE SHAPE OF THE WINGS A REALLY CLEVER IDEA IT REALLY IS 
IT'LL ALWAYS FLY BACK DOWN JESS DESCRIBE WHAT YOU'VE DONE 
WE'VE DECIDED TO DO A CIRCULAR DESIGN FOR IT AND WE HAVE A FIN 
SO IT'LL KEEP UP IN THE AIR AND NOT GO STRAIGHT BACK DOWN 
AS SOON AS IT'S AT ITS TOP POINT IT'D EJECT CONFETTI O. K. 
I WANTED TO ADD A WHISTLE IF WE'VE GOT LIGHTS AND CONFETTI 
AND A WHISTLE IT'LL BE OVER THE TOP INSTEAD OF JUST A ROCKET IDEA 
DO YOU AGREE JACK 
NOT REALLY BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS ALL ABOUT BEING OVER THE TOP 
UNIQUE IS OVER THE TOP 
SHOULD WE ADD THE WHISTLE THEN I'M NOT THE ONLY TEAM MEMBER 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THE WHISTLE'S GOOD IT WOULD BE GOOD 
JACK WANTED TO ADD WHISTLES AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS OVER THE TOP 
BUT WE DID ADD THEM AND IT'LL BE REALLY GOOD 
BIG SHOTS HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON 
WE WANT THIS ROCKET TO BE BIGGER THAN ANYTHING THAT'S AVAILABLE 
SO THEN WE'VE GOT KIND OF CONCORDE WINGS 
TO ALLOW IT TO FLY BACK DOWN IN A CONTROLLED WAY BY ITSELF 
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT MATERIALS IT HAS TO BE PLASTIC OR POLYSTYRENE 
YOU'RE GETTING YOUR IDEAS TOGETHER MY ADVICE TO YOU WOULD BE 
THINK ABOUT MULTIPLE MISSIONS AND ALSO THINK THIS IS A TOY 
UNLIKE THE BIG SHOTS THE BRIGHT SPARKS ARE LISTENING TO EACH OTHER 
AND HAVE NOW STARTED TO THINK OF A NAME 
SUPER DUPER SUPREME SKY HIGH OR OUT OF THIS WORLD 
I LIKE THE SKY HIGH ONE I LIKE SKY HIGH 
SO WHAT DESIGN IDEAS DO WE WANT ON THE MAIN BIT OF THE ROCKET 
WE WANT SOMETHING BRIGHT VIBRANT MAYBE A LOGO ON IT 
MEANWHILE THE BIG SHOTS SEEM TO BE IGNORING THEIR MARKET RESEARCH 
AND ARE GOING ALL HIGH TECH 
WE COULD PUT AS WE SAID EARLIER A KIND OF WEBCAM IDEA ON THERE 
THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE BUT AGAIN IT WOULD COME DOWN TO WEIGHT 
IT WOULD BE A NICE THING TO BE ABLE TO DO A NICE FEATURE 
THAT I THINK KIDS WOULD DEFINITELY DEFINITELY LIKE 
HAVING DECIDED ON THE CAMERA CAN THEY AGREE ON THE COLOUR 
IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THEY CAN SEE AT FORTY METRES UP 
WHICH KIND OF IMPLIES BRIGHT COLOURS NOT DARK COLOURS 
I THINK LUMINOUS YELLOW AND LUMINOUS ORANGE YELLOW AND ORANGE 
THEY WOULD LOVE I'M HAPPY WITH THAT 
O. K. BRIGHT SPARKS YOUR TIME IS UP 
JACK CAN YOU PLEASE PRESENT YOUR FINAL IDEA TO ME 
IT'S A ROCKET WHICH IS AIR POWERED 
AND WE'VE PUT OUR NAME ON IT WHICH IS SKY HIGH 
AND THIS IS CONFETTI HERE 
WHICH WOULD COME OUT WHEN IT'S AT ITS HIGHEST POINT 
WE ALSO HAVE SOME LIGHTS THEY'RE GOING TO BE RAINBOW COLOURS 
THESE ARE THE WHISTLES SO WHEN IT GOES UP IN THE SKY 
AND SPINS AROUND IT'S GOING TO BE MAKING A WHISTLE NOISE 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ENSURE THAT YOUR ROCKET 
CAN ACHIEVE MULTIPLE MISSIONS 
WE'VE GOT TWO CAPS SO IF IT DID HIT A WALL YOU COULD REPLACE IT 
YOU'VE INCORPORATED ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE BRIEF 
YOU'VE CERTAINLY THOUGHT ABOUT THE DESIGN AND THE COLOUR 
AND THE NAME AND ALSO ABOUT THE MULTIPLE MISSIONS 
VERY WELL DONE THANK YOU 
COLLETTE CAN YOU PLEASE PITCH YOUR FINAL IDEA 
WE WANT OURS TO BE THE ROCKET THAT GOES THE HIGHEST 
SO IT WILL GO UP VERY FAST IT WILL GO UP VERY HIGH 
AND THEN IT WILL GLIDE DOWN 
THE REAL ELEMENT HERE WHICH WE'RE QUITE EXCITED ABOUT 
IS THAT IT'LL HAVE A CAMERA IN IT 
SO AS IT'S ACTUALLY GOING UP 
IT WILL BE TAKING PHOTOS OF WHAT'S BENEATH 
CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME WHAT THE NAME OF YOUR ROCKET IS 
AND ALSO YOUR COLOUR SCHEME THE NAME HAS TO GO DOWN TO COLLETTE 
SHE CAME UP WITH THE WONDERFUL NAME LUNAR LENS 
THE COLOUR SCHEME IS QUITE IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF BEING LUMINOUS 
SO THAT'S YELLOW AND ORANGE 
AND FINALLY WHAT MATERIALS HAVE YOU DECIDED UPON 
IT'LL BE VERSIONS OF POLYSTYRENE 
DEPENDING ON WHAT'S MOST ROBUST 
I THINK YOUR DESIGN LOOKS REALLY GOOD 
AND I HAVE TO SAY THE CAMERA IS A VERY EXCITING ELEMENT TO IT 
THANK YOU NOW THE NEXT STAGE 
IS THAT YOU'VE GOT TO GO TO THE SCIENCE MUSEUM TO PRESENT YOUR IDEA 
YOU'RE ALL EXPERT BUSINESS PEOPLE I'M SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO PITCH 
BUT MY ADVICE WOULD BE BE CONFIDENT AND BE PASSIONATE 
IN PREPARATION FOR THE PITCHES 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS ADDED MOTORISED SPINS AND A LAUNCH TRIGGER 
THEY'VE ALSO PUT TOGETHER A COLOURFUL PRESENTATION 
WHILE THE BIG SHOTS BEING THE BOSSES HAVE WORKED UP THEIR IDEA 
INTO A PROFESSIONAL PITCH 
BUT ONLY ONE TEAM CAN WIN THE BEAT THE BOSS TROPHY 
SO THE PRESSURE'S ON AS BOTH TEAMS MEET AT LONDON SCIENCE MUSEUM 
THE U. K.'S MOST VISITED SCIENCE ATTRACTION 
WHERE THEY'LL BE PRESENTING THEIR IDEAS TO ASHLEIGH THE BUYER 
THE BIG SHOTS WILL ACT REALLY SMART BUT THEY'RE JUST BIG GIRLS 
I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET THE BRIGHT SPARKS BRING IT ON 
HELLO SO YOU ARE THE ONES WHO WANT TO CHALLENGE US THEN 
SO WHAT DO YOU DO THEN I'M A FARMER 
AND I MAKE MY OWN PRODUCTS SAUSAGES AND BACON 
YOU CAN'T MAKE A ROCKET OUT OF SAUSAGES 
MORNING GUYS YOU READY TO GO YES 
WE'LL TOSS A COIN TO SEE WHO GOES FIRST 
WHO WANTS TO CALL HEADS O. K. 
TAILS IT IS DO YOU WANT TO GO FIRST GUYS YEP 
O. K. LET'S GO BYE LOSERS BYE LOSERS 
THEY'RE GOING TO GET THRASHED ABSOLUTELY THRASHED 
SKY HIGH IS A RE USABLE AIR POWERED TOY ROCKET 
SKY HIGH IS A UNIQUE DESIGN AND FUN FOR ALL THE FAMILY 
WITH SPECIAL SKY HIGH SURPRISES OOH 
SKY HIGH TAKES OFF WITH A FOOT PUMP WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE BOX 
HOWEVER HIGH YOU WANT YOUR ROCKET TO GO YOU PUMP FOR LONGER 
SKY HIGH HAS SPECIAL STREAMERS THAT SHOOT OUT BUT REMAIN CONNECTED 
CONFETTI COMES OUT OF TWO FLAPS AND WHEN IT'S AT MAXIMUM HEIGHT 
IT SHOOTS OUT AND IS FUN FOR ALL THE FAMILY 
MOTORISED FINS THEY SPIN AROUND FOR MAXIMUM HEIGHT AND SPEED 
WE ARE POSITIVE OUR ROCKET IS AN ORIGINAL 
WITH EXCITING AND SCIENTIFIC DESIGN KEEPING CHILDREN 
AND GROWN UPS ENTERTAINED FOR HOURS THANK YOU 
THANK YOU THAT SOUNDS GREAT 
YOUR MOTORISED FINS 
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO CONTROL FROM THE GROUND 
ONCE THE ROCKET IS AIRBORNE 
NO THEY JUST SIMPLY SPIN AROUND 
RIGHT THEY SPIN UP 
O. K. THE ONLY THING IS IF THEY'RE MOTORISED THEY MIGHT BE HEAVY 
YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT THE LIGHTS SOUND GREAT 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET THOSE ON TO THE ROCKET 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ON THE CAPS 
HEY CAN BE LIKE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS VERY LIGHT 
O. K. THAT SOUNDS POSSIBLE 
I CAN'T SEE ANY OTHER POTENTIAL PROBLEMS SO GOOD LUCK 
THANK YOU 
WITH THE BRIGHT SPARKS' PITCH OVER WITH THE BIG SHOTS ARE UP NEXT 
HOW WAS IT IT'S ALL IN THE FOLDER 
TRYING TO BE ADULTS YOU NEED TO TAKE YOUR TRACTOR HOME WE SHALL SEE 
I THINK OUR PITCH WAS GOOD THEY'RE SO ANNOYING 
THEY REALLY NEED TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER THEY WON'T WIN LIKE THIS 
OUR MISSION FOR THIS PROJECT IS TO CREATE A ROCKET THAT GOES WHOOSH 
ON ITS WAY UP AND THEN WE WANT IT TO GLIDE DOWN SO THAT'S OUR WHEE 
AND ALONG THE WAY WE WANT IT TO GO ZAP AND TAKE AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY 
WHEN THE ROCKET HAS LANDED YOU'RE THEN REALLY INTERESTED TO GO 
AND SEE WHAT PICTURES IT'S DONE 
THE CAMERA FOR US IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT 
IT'S GOING TO HAVE WATER AND AIR PROPULSION 
THE FUSELAGE ITSELF WILL BE MADE OUT OF A VERY LIGHT PLASTIC 
HOW WILL YOU GET THE CAMERA TO TAKE THE SHOT EXACTLY WHEN YOU WANT IT TO 
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT DIGITAL CAMERAS 
ONCE TRIGGERED IT TAKES A SERIES OF PICTURES YOU CAN HAVE A TIME DELAY 
AS IT GLIDES DOWN IT CAN TAKE A SERIES OF PICTURES 
THEIR ROCKET'S CALLED LUNAR LENS AND THEY'RE PUTTING A CAMERA ON IT 
THAT WILL WEIGH IT DOWN AND IT WILL LOOK COMPLETELY STUPID 
I THINK THE CAMERA POTENTIALLY COULD POSE SOME PROBLEMS FOR YOU 
I THINK THE BRIGHT SPARKS HAVE THE EDGE AT THIS STAGE 
THEIR ROCKET WILL BE MORE VISUALLY IMPRESSIVE 
WITH THE PITCHES OVER THE BIG SHOTS WORK WITH GRAPHIC DESIGNER GLYN 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS WORK WITH JOHN THE TECHNOLOGIST ON THEIR LAUNCH SYSTEM 
THAT BOX CONTAINS A BATTERY PUSHING THE BUTTON FIRES THE ROCKET 
THAT'S BETTER THAN A TRIGGER 
THREE TWO ONE 
HAVING DECIDED ON THE LAUNCH SYSTEM 
THEY MAKE EASY WORK OF CHOOSING THE MATERIAL FOR THEIR NOSE CONE 
BUT THE BIG SHOTS CAN'T AGREE ON HOW THEIR ROCKET SHOULD LOOK 
FOUR WINGS IT DOUBLES YOUR DRAG 
IT'S NOT INTERESTING TO LOOK AT 
WILFRED'S IDEAS ARE ALWAYS INTERESTING 
BUT TRYING TO REINVENT FLIGHT WAS A BAD IDEA 
A BIG SHOT HAS TO BE PREPARED TO GET OVER PROBLEMS 
LET'S THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX CAN WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT CHANGES COLOUR 
CERTAIN THINGS LOOK GREEN AND THEN FROM ANOTHER ANGLE PURPLE YEAH 
THAT WOULD LOOK VERY NICE IT'S GOOD YEAH 
AS THE BIG SHOTS FINALLY AGREE ON SOMETHING TIME TO SWAP EXPERTS 
WE DON'T WANT ANY WHITE ON THE TOP 
THE BEST BIT ABOUT TODAY WAS' 
SEEING OUR DESIGN ON THE COMPUTER IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT WAS IN MY HEAD 
IS IT TO BE SPINNING I'VE ADDED THESE FINS WHICH YOU COULD ANGLE 
TO GET YOUR SPIN AS IT GOES 
WITH THE BRIGHT SPARKS' DESIGN COMPLETED 
THE BIG SHOTS CHANGE THEIR MINDS AGAIN 
SWAPPING THEIR ELECTRIC PUMP FOR A HAND ONE 
IT ADDS TO THE INTERACTION WITH THE PRODUCT 
THE CAMERA YOU CAN DO IT 
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IT LOVELY PROFESSOR I'LL LOVE YOU FOR EVER 
PUTTING A CAMERA INTO A ROCKET 
AND EXPECTING IT TO FLY DOWN AND NOT BREAK IS A LITTLE BIT OF A RISK 
I CAN'T GUARANTEE HOW RELIABLE IT WILL BE ON THE TWENTY FIFTH LANDING 
WHAT I HEARD WAS YES WE'LL TRY PROFESSOR YOU'RE GOOD FANTASTIC 
WHAT DO OUR EXPERTS THINK OF THE DESIGNS 
I WOULD BET ON THE BRIGHT SPARKS 
THEIR ROCKET IS LIKELY TO WORK 
THE BIG SHOTS' ROCKET HAS A HIGH RISK FACTOR 
THE BIG SHOTS WERE VERY AMBITIOUS 
WHICH WAS GOOD BUT IT COULD BE THEIR DOWNFALL 
BUT IT'S NOT UP TO THEM THAT'S THE JOB OF 
THE PRODUCTS HAVE NOW BEEN MADE BY THE BOFFINS AT MIDDLESEX UNIVERSITY 
IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT WHO'LL TAKE AWAY THE TROPHY 
BOTH OUR TEAMS HAVE TOUCHED DOWN AT BEAT THE BOSS H. Q. TO FIND OUT 
THE BIG DAY'S HERE I'M QUIETLY CONFIDENT 
THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GONNA LOSE KIDS WILL HAVE FUN AND LOVE IT 
I DON'T WANT TO GET BEATEN BY KIDS IT WOULDN'T LOOK GOOD FOR ME 
IT WOULD BE AMAZING TO BEAT THE ENTREPRENEURS WE'RE JUST KIDS 
WE MAKE OUR LIVING FROM INNOVATIVE IDEAS 
SO KIDS PREPARE TO LOSE

IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS 
I LOVE THE COLOURS IT'S EVERYTHING WE EVER WANTED 
HOW DO YOU LAUNCH THIS ROCKET WE PUT A FOOT PUMP 
BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO USE TELL ME ABOUT THIS MECHANISM HERE 
IT'S A REMOTE CONTROL YOU PRESS THE GREEN BUTTON AND RED BUTTON 
AND IT SHOULD SHOOT OFF WHAT ARE THE OTHER FEATURES ON THE ROCKET 
WE'VE GOT LIGHTS AT THE TOP HERE SO YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE NIGHT 
AND STREAMERS THAT FOLLOW IT WHEN THE ROCKET TAKES OFF 
WHAT'S THE CONFETTI FOR WE PUT IT IN THE TOP HERE 
AND WHEN THE ROCKET TAKES OFF SO DOES THE CONFETTI WHAT D'YOU THINK 
I LIKE IT A LOT BUT IT'S THE KIDS THAT VOTE ON IT IN THE END 
I THINK WE UNDERESTIMATED THEM IT'S A GOOD DESIGN 
BUT YOU'LL CAUSE LITTER WITH THE CONFETTI NONSENSE 
I ASKED TO MAKE IT BIODEGRADABLE OOH DID YOU 
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK BUT WHAT DID YOUR TARGET MARKET THINK 
IF YOU TAKE A SEAT WE'LL FIND OUT 
THE ROCKETS WERE UNVEILED AT THE BEAT THE BOSS LAUNCH SITE 
OUR TWENTY FIVE JUDGES DON'T KNOW WHO'S MADE WHICH PRODUCT 
THREE TWO ONE LIFT OFF 
FIRST THE BIG SHOTS' LUNAR LENS 
I LIKE LUNAR LENS BECAUSE OF THE CAMERA 
IT MAKES YOU SEE WHERE IT'S BEEN 
I WOULDN'T BUY IT COS I HAVEN'T GOT A COMPUTER SO COULDN'T USE IT 
IT'S GOOD GRAPHICS BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD LAST LONGER 
IT NEEDS TO BE HIGHER I FEEL SORRY FOR LIKE YOU KNOW 
SHORT PEOPLE HAVE TO STAND ON A STOOL 
I THINK THIS SHOULD BE SHORTER 
WHAT I LIKED BEST ABOUT LUNAR LENS 
IS THE COLOURFUL PAPER ON THE BACK 
NEXT PRIMED FOR TAKE OFF THE BRIGHT SPARKS' SKY HIGH 
ONE 
IT'S ALMOST ON TWO 
WICKED 
THAT'S AMAZING 
SKY HIGH ROCKET IS OUT OF THIS WORLD I'D DEFINITELY GET IT 
ONE THING I DON'T LIKE IS THAT IT'S MESSY AFTER YOU'VE LAUNCHED IT 
WITH ALL THE CONFETTI AND STREAMERS 
IT'D LOOK WICKED IN THE DARK IT LOOKS LIKE A PARTY GOING ON YEAH 
ONE THING I DIDN'T LIKE IS IT DIDN'T SPIN VERY QUICKLY 
THE OTHER ONE HAS ONE FEATURE ON IT BUT THIS HAS A LOT 
WITH THE STREAMERS AND THE CONFETTI AND THE LIGHTS 
BRIGHT SPARKS OUR JUDGES REALLY LIKE THE FEATURES OF YOUR ROCKET 
BUT FELT IT COULD GET MESSY AFTER TAKE OFF WITH THE CONFETTI 
BIG SHOTS OUR JUDGES LIKED THE CAMERA 
BUT FELT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO POSITION THE ROCKET FOR TAKE OFF 
BUT WHO DID THEY VOTE AS THE OVERALL WINNER OF THE BEAT THE BOSS TROPHY
