STOP STOP STOP STOP O. K. 
TOSH TOSH YOU O. K. 
I KNEW I WANTED TO DO THE STORIES OF THE CHARACTERS PRE TORCHWOOD 
FROM WAY BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF SERIES TWO 
IT'S THE SEASON FINALE COMING UP NEXT WEEK 
AND THIS IS THE TIME TO TAKE STOCK 
THIS IS TIME TO LOOK AT WHO WE ARE OR WHY WE'RE THERE 
WHO WE COULD BE WHO THEY WERE ALL THESE TORCHWOOD PEOPLE 
A BOMB GOES OFF PUTS THEM ALL IN DANGER 
WE STUDY EACH ONE IN THAT CRISIS 
READY FOR NEXT WEEK 
I'M GONNA TEAR YOUR WORLD APART CAPTAIN JACK HARKNESS 
WE SEE JACK BACK IN VICTORIAN TIMES 
AND THERE'S SO MANY GAPS TO FILL IN IT'S SO EXCITING 
IT WAS JUST THAT THING OF HOW WOULD HE SURVIVE 
HOW WOULD HE SURVIVE ONE HUNDRED YEARS WAITING FOR THE DOCTOR 
I LOVE PLAYING THAT 
IT WAS A GOOD THING FOR ME TO GET IN A PERIOD OUTFIT 
AND YOU MIGHT NOTICE THAT I HAD 
SLIGHTLY BIGGER SIDEBURNS ON THAT EPISODE 
WHICH WERE PAINSTAKINGLY PUT ON 
I HATE THINGS BEING PUT ON MY FACE AND IT WAS EVERY DAY 
AND I'D SCREAM BEFORE THEY'D PUT IT ON IN THE MORNING 
I DON'T LIKE THE FEELING OF GLUE GOING IN MY FACE 
ALICE AND EMILY ARE VICIOUS TO ME 
IT'S COME TO THEM 
ARRRRGH 
I AM WHAT TORCHWOOD IS OUT THERE TO PROTECT EVERYBODY FROM 
SO OF COURSE THEY'RE GONNA BE LIKE THAT 
ACTION WHOAAA 
WHOAAARGH ARGH 
THEN I HAVE TO PROVE MYSELF TO THEM BUT AT THAT POINT ALSO JACK WILL DO ANYTHING FOR MONEY 
O. K. STAND BY FOR REHEARSAL PLEASE 
HE DOESN'T HAPPILY WALK INTO TORCHWOOD AND SAY 
HOORAY I WORK FOR YOU 
HE'S COERCED INTO IT HE'S TRAPPED INTO IT IN SOME WAYS 
AND YET FINDS HIS PLACE IN LIFE 
CAPTAIN JACK GOES BACK TO WHAT HE KNOWS 
HE BECOMES A MERCENARY AGAIN HE'S DOING MISSIONS FOR MONEY REALLY 
I SAID SORRY 
COME ON THIS IS MY FIRST OFFENCE 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOU CAN'T LOCK ME UP 
WHY IT WAS A THREAT TO THE EMPIRE 
LIKE ME 
I THINK BY HIM SEEING HOW BRUTAL 
THE CURRENT MEMBERS OF TORCHWOOD 
WERE AT THAT TIME HE FEELS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING 
INTERESTINGLY IN A WAY YOU COULD SAY 
THAT THE THING THAT TORCHWOOD WAS MISSING 
THAT CAPTAIN JACK KNEW WAS MISSING 
WAS SOMEONE LIKE GWEN COOPER 
BUT IT TOOK HIM ONE HUNDRED YEARS TO FIND THE RIGHT PERSON TO FILL THAT SPACE 
I'D OFTEN THOUGHT HOW TOSH CAME TO BEING IN TORCHWOOD 
I KNEW THAT JACK HAD FOUND HER AND RECRUITED HER 
WHEN I READ EPISODE TWELVE IT JUST MADE COMPLETE SENSE 
I WANT TO SEE MY MOTHER 
I WANT TO KNOW SHE'S ALL RIGHT 
NOW 
IN A WAY THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO TOSHIKO BY JOINING TORCHWOOD 
HAPPENED VIA THE WORST THINGS THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO HER 
WITH HER MOTHER AND BECOMING A DOUBLE AGENT 
AND STEALING STUFF AND BEING COERCED INTO CRIME 
THE WHOLE THING OF INVOLVING TOSH'S MOTHER 
DID IT FOR ME 
HAVING YOUR MOTHER OR FATHER 
INVOLVED WOULD PUSH YOU TO THOSE KIND OF EXTREMES 
THE TOSHIKO STORY WAS A GREAT ONE 
FOR A DIRECTOR BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF DIALOGUE IN IT 
IT'S ALL ABOUT 
SHOWING HER STATE OF MIND 
AND HER SADNESS AND LONELINESS 
THROUGH VISUALS 
THE CELL WAS ACTUALLY BUILT IN THE STUDIO 
WHICH I TRIED TO MAKE AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE WITH THE DESIGNERS 
CUT THERE VERY NICE AND CUT 
SHE'S AT THE LOWEST OF THE LOW 
SHE'S IMPRISONED IN A SORT OF INDOOR GUANTANAMO BAY 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY LOW BUT THERE'S ONE MAN 
ONE MAN IN THE UNIVERSE WHO SEES HOW CLEVER AND HOW VALUABLE SHE COULD BE 
YOU'VE GOT TO GET ME OUT OF HERE 
IF 
YOU 
COME WORK FOR ME 
REALLY 
THE THREE ACTORS NAOKO GARETH AND BURN LOVED THEIR STORY 
I THINK BURN PARTICULARLY 
OH MY OH MY GOD 
IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME 
IN TERMS OF HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS RELATIONSHIPS AND WOMEN 
IT ANSWERS A LOT OF QUESTIONS' 
I'M MARRYING YOU EVEN IF IT KILLS ME 
O. K. 
OWEN WAS AND IS CAPABLE 
OH MY GOD OH MY GOD 
KATIE 
HE HAD IT ALL YOU KNOW 
HE HAD A GREAT JOB 
HE HAD A FIANCE HE HAD A GREAT FUTURE AHEAD OF HIM 
AND EVERYTHING WAS RIPPED FROM UNDER HIM 
WHAT IS IT 
I'M SORRY 
I TRIED TO STOP THEM SHE'S DEAD 
I HOPE THAT OWEN'S STORY GOES A WAY TO EXPLAINING 
THAT RAGE THAT WE'VE SEEN IN HIM 
NO COME ON COME ON 
SPLIT UP AGH 
I REALLY WANTED TO BRING THE PTERODACTYL BACK IN 
BECAUSE WE LOVED THE PTERODACTYL QUITE HARD TO SHOEHORN INTO STORIES GENERALLY 
UM SO IT WAS A GREAT CHANCE 
I REALLY JUST WANTED TO WRITE A ROMANTIC COMEDY 
WITH A PTERODACTYL 
BETWEEN JACK AND IANTO THAT'S WHAT THAT SEGMENT'S ABOUT 
A A A AH 
AGH I'M SORRY 
WHAT LOOK OUT WHOA 
OH IT WAS BRILLIANT IT WAS 
I JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH IT 
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY HOW IANTO JOINED TORCHWOOD 
I COULD DO THAT 
LIKE A BUTLER I COULD BE A BUTLER 
WE DON'T NEED A BUTLER EXCUSE ME DRIED EGG ON YOUR COLLAR 
IT WAS A BUSY WEEK WHAT EXACTLY IS YOUR PLAN 
THE PTERODACTYL SCENE WAS QUITE A NUMBER TO SHOOT FIRST I WANTED TO FIND AN AMAZING LOCATION 
WHERE YOU COULD REALLY IMAGINE SOMEONE KEEPING A PTERODACTYL 
THE BIG SORT OF STEELWORKS WE FOUND WAS IDEAL 
BECAUSE IT MEANT THAT WE COULD LIGHT IT 
AND GIVE IT A LOT OF DEPTH 
AND LIGHT FROM THE SIDE AND ABOVE 
AND GIVE IT THIS HUGE KIND OF AIRCRAFT HANGER LIKE FEEL 
I WANTED IT TO SORT OF BE QUITE REALISTIC 
AND I DIDN'T WANT A SMALL ROOM WITH A PTERODACTYL FLYING AROUND 
TOO CLOSE TO US ALL THE TIME 
AS SOON AS WE GOT THERE AS SOON AS YOU KNOW THE PTERODACTYL'S THERE 
THE WAREHOUSE WAS SO VAST 
YOU COULD REALLY IMAGINE IT IT WAS LIT SO BEAUTIFULLY 
YOU COULD REALLY IMAGINE IT 
JACK BEING CARRIED AROUND BY THIS PTERODACTYL STANDING IN FRONT OF YOU 
THE IDEA WAS ALWAYS TO HAVE THE PTERODACTYL GO AWAY FROM US 
AND SEE IT FROM IANTO'S POINT OF VIEW 
SO IT SORT OF DISAPPEARS WITH JACK HANGING OFF IT 
WE DIDN'T DO JACK DROPPING ONTO IANTO AT THE LOCATION 
WE DECIDED TO DO THAT IN THE SORT OF MORE CONTROLLED ATMOSPHERE 
OF THE GREEN SCREEN STUDIO 
I WAS QUITE LUCKY FOR THE BIT WHERE UM 
JACK LANDS OF IANTO THEY GOT SOME THEY GOT A DOUBLE IN 
ACTION A A A A AH 
AGH 
I DID A LOT OF HANGING FROM WIRES IN THE PTERODACTYL EPISODE 
AGH 
'. YOU KNOW EVERYTHING'S VERY SAFE 
I WAS ROTATING MOVING BACK AND FORTH 
IT WAS TOTALLY COMFORTABLE 
UM AND I HAD TO PRETEND YOU KNOW BEING PICKED UP BY THE PTERODACTYL 
SO THEY WOULD HURTLE THIS FAKE LEG AT ME 
AND I WOULD TRY TO GRAB ONTO IT WITH ONE HAND AND OFF I'D GO 
BUT IT WAS GOOD FUN 
WE'VE CUT 
IF I WAS TEN YEARS OLD AND DOING THAT 
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN AWESOME 
I'M FORTY AND DOING IT AND IT'S STILL AWESOME 
THREE TWO ONE 
ACTION 
AARGH
