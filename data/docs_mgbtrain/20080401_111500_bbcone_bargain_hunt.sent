WELL NO DADS DO 
THERE'S THE IDEAL WEDDING COMING UP WHAT IS YOUR IDEAL WEDDING 
IT'S A WINTER WEDDING 
ALL ICE AND SNOW AND WINTER WONDERLAND 
REALLY THAT'S MY DREAM 
GENETICALLY YOU SHOULD HAVE A LONG AND HAPPY MARRIAGE 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN MARRIED FOR PAUL 
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR THIRTY ONE YEARS THIS YEAR TIM 
AND FOR OUR SILVER WEDDING ANNIVERSARY 
I ARRANGED TO HAVE OUR VOWS RETAKEN AGAIN 
BUT WITHOUT MY WIFE KNOWING 
HOW DID IT GO EVERYTHING WAS GOOD UNTIL SHE TRIED TO ESCAPE WHAT 
THE VICAR HAD LOCKED ONE OF THE DOORS FORTUNATELY 
BUT YOU GOT HER BACK I GOT HER BACK YEAH 
THIS IS GETTING UP FRONT AND PERSONAL 
OVER TO THE BLUES 
NOW YOU TWO WOULDN'T BY ANY CHANCE BE IN THE SCOUTS WOULD YOU 
WE ARE TIM DIB DIB DIB DIB DIB DIB DIB DO OUR BEST 
I NEVER WAS A SCOUT SO I'M NOT FRIGHTFULLY GOOD ON ALL THIS 
BUT YOU'RE ON A SPECIAL MISSION AREN'T YOU YES 
WE ARE CUB SCOUT LEADERS OF THE THIRD COVENTRY AND THIS YEAR'S ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SCOUTING 
WE'RE HERE TO PROMOTE SCOUTING AND RAISE SOME FUNDS 
AND YOU'VE SET YOUR TEAMS A TASK HAVEN T. Y. L. 
WE'VE SET ALL OUR KIDS ONE HUNDRED CHALLENGES AS IT'S ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SCOUTING 
AND WE THOUGHT THE KIDS ARE DOING CHALLENGES 
WHY SHOULDN'T THE LEADERS HAVE A GO 
JEANETTE HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SCOUTING 
I'VE BEEN HELPING OUT FOR ABOUT TWELVE YEARS 
SINCE MY ELDEST SON JOINED THE SCOUTS 
AND I'VE JUST DONE MY TRAINING 
SO I'M NOW OFFICIALLY A CUB SCOUT LEADER 
SHOULDN'T YOU BE A BROWNIE 
NOT REALLY BECAUSE GIRLS CAN DO CUB SCOUTS NOW 
AND ALL MY FAMILY'S INTO SCOUTS SO GO WITH THE FLOW 
QUITE RIGHT TOO AND WHAT SORT OF THINGS DO YOU GET UP TO SCOUTING 
WE TAKE KIDS CAMPING WE DO LOTS OF OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES 
WHETHER IT'S CANOEING ROAD SAFETY PERSONAL SAFETY 
ANYTHING TO DO WITH LIFE SKILLS THEY CAN TAKE AND USE IN FUTURE LIFE 
WELL WE HAVE TO REMEMBER YOUR MOTTO BE PREPARED 
AND THAT APPLIES TO THE REDS TOO 
NOW IT'S THE THREE HUNDRED MOMENT HERE YOU GO THREE HUNDRED THANK YOU 
THREE HUNDRED THANK YOU YOU KNOW THE RULES 
YOUR EXPERTS AWAIT AND OFF YOU GO AND VERY VERY GOOD LUCK 
SO THERE THEY GO I THINK IT'LL BE A QUESTION OF GING GANG GOOLIE 
WILL TODAY'S EXPERTS BE AS PREPARED 
HOPING NOT TO DROP ANY GOOLIES FOR THE REDS IS PHILIP SERRELL 
AND TRYING HER BEST SCOUTS HONOUR FOR THE BLUES 
IT'S CATHERINE SOUTHON 
RIGHT PHILIP THIS SAYS 
HE WHO HESITATES IS LOST WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I THINK I'M GOING TO START HESITATING 
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS STUFF 
I'M NOT TOO SURE ABOUT IT CAN YOU THROW ANY LIGHT ON IT 
YEAH IT'S TORQUAYWARE 
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF POTTERIES IN AND AROUND THE TORQUAY AREA 
THAT PRODUCE WARES JUST LIKE THIS 
WHAT I'M WARY ABOUT WITH THIS IS THAT FIRST OF ALL 
CAN YOU SEE THIS HANDLE'S BEEN OFF AH NO I DIDN'T 
ALL RIGHT SO THAT HANDLE'S BEEN OFF 
AND THEN JUST AS I'M TALKING TO YOU FEELING IT 
ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO LOOK AT DAMAGE IS TO RUN YOUR FINGERS ROUND 
AND WHEN YOU OH YOU JUST 
THE ENDS OF YOUR FINGERTIPS ARE VERY SENSITIVE 
AND YOU CAN FEEL CHIPS OR DAMAGES TO THE RIM 
AND THERE ARE DAMAGES TO THIS PIECE 
I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT ALL THE OTHERS SO THERE MIGHT BE SOME DAMAGE 
THIS PARTICULAR SET WOULD YOU THINK IT'S COMPLETE 
WHAT YOU'VE GOT HERE IN MY VIEW IS THE CUP AND POSSIBLY A SIDE PLATE 
A CREAM JUG A MILK JUG A CUP AND POSSIBLY A SIDE PLATE 
THESE I THINK ARE FROM TWO DIFFERENT POTTERIES O. K. 
YOU CAN SEE THEY'VE GOT DIFFERENT DESIGNS ON THEM 
AND I ALSO THINK WE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE A SUGAR BOWL AND A TEAPOT 
SO WHAT'S THE PRICE 
IT'S MARKED UP AT THIRTY EIGHT 
IF I'M REALLY TRUTHFUL I THINK IN AUCTION YOU COULD LOSE MONEY 
THERE'S AN EXPRESSION IN THIS BUSINESS 
IF THE ONLY THING YOU'VE GOT TO APOLOGISE FOR IS THE PRICE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT 
BUT WITH THIS YOU HAVE TO APOLOGISE THAT IT'S DIFFERENT FACTORIES 
THERE IS SOME DAMAGE IT DOESN'T ALL MATCH IT'S NOT PERHAPS A SET 
AND I THINK YOU MIGHT BE A BIT HAMSTRUNG 
O. K. ARE YOU GONNA LET HIM BUY THIS WELL IT'S NOT MY CUP OF TEA 
HA HA VERY GOOD 
BUT MY DAD LIKES IT HE LIKES THE QUIRKINESS OF IT 
AND HE'S PICKED IT UP IT'S FATE 
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS I'D SAY WE'LL BUY IT 
THE REDS CERTAINLY DID AND PICKED UP THE TEA SET FOR THIRTY 
NOW WHAT ARE THE SCOUTS UP TO 
HUGH SIR YOUR BREAKFAST IS SERVED THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS THAT'S VERY NICE 
ANY IDEAS WHAT IT IS LOOKS LIKE A SOUP TUREEN 
CLOSE IT'S NOT QUITE A SOUP TUREEN 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE OF A CIRCULAR SHAPE 
THIS IS A LOVELY OVAL SHAPE AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR YOUR BREAKFAST 
SO PERHAPS YOUR SAUSAGES OR BACON SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I THINK WHAT'S MISSING OBVIOUSLY IS THE LADLE OR THE TONGS 
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM 
BECAUSE YOU CAN PROBABLY PICK THAT UP QUITE EASILY YEAH 
BUT WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT IS THE WONDERFUL ELEGANT SHAPE 
AND THE LOVELY LEGS COMING DOWN HERE 
TERMINATING IN LITTLE FEET AT THE BOTTOM YEAH 
WITH THE LOVELY SCROLL AT THE TOP ALMOST LIKE A CORINTHIAN COLUMN 
IS IT SOMETHING THAT EXCITES YOU IT IS ACTUALLY I LIKE THE LEGS 
AND I LOVE IS IT PEARL 
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY PEARL IT'S IVORY HERE 
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT DREW ME TO IT 
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT H. FOR HUGH NICELY ENGRAVED ON THAT FANTASTIC 
SEE I'M THINKING OF YOU 
AND THEN UNDERNEATH WE'VE GOT THE DATE THERE ENGRAVED NINETEEN THIRTEEN 
SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN PERSONALISED FOR A FAMILY 
GOOD IDEA TO USE IT ON CUB CAMP THOUGH CUB CAMP PERFECT 
KEEP THE BREAKFAST WARM WHILE WE'RE COOKING FANTASTIC 
PUT THEIR LITTLE SAUSAGES AND BACON IN THERE FANTASTIC 
IF WE TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN WE CAN SEE THE SILVER PLATE MARK UNDERNEATH 
BUT IT HAS GOT A NICE BIT OF WEIGHT TO IT NICE AND HEAVY 
SO IT'S A GOOD SOLID PIECE 
HOW MUCH IS HE ASKING FOR IT THEY'RE ACTUALLY ASKING SIXTY FIVE FOR THIS 
I MEAN IN ITSELF I DON'T THINK THAT'S TOO BAD 
IT'S TOO DEAR BUT WILL IT MAKE A PROFIT 
IF WE CAN GET IT CHEAPER IF WE COULD GET IT FOR ABOUT FORTY WE MIGHT BE IN WITH A CHANCE O. K. 
GO AND DO YOUR STUFF THANK YOU SEE YOU LATER 
THE BLUES BAGGED THE SILVER PLATED SERVING DISH FOR THIRTY FIVE 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS LITTLE HONEY 
ISN'T THAT JUST THE MOST GLORIOUS LITTLE PICTURE 
STRICTLY SPEAKING IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD CALL A CONVERSATION PICTURE 
A CONVERSATION PICTURE BEING AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY TERM 
TO DESCRIBE A SCENE WITH MORE THAN ONE PERSON 
USUALLY IN A DOMESTIC SETTING 
AND HERE WE'VE GOT AN EXTREMELY ARISTOCRATIC LADY 
SITTING IN HER SOPHISTICATED BOWER IN THE GARDEN 
WITH A TRELLIS ENTWINED WITH FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE BEHIND HER 
ABOUT TO SERVE A GENTLEMAN A CUP OF SOMETHING 
AND IN THE BACKGROUND THERE'S A LANDSCAPE WITH ANOTHER FIGURE 
AND THE WHOLE THING IS JUST A PERFECTION OF PAINTING 
ANOTHER AMUSING THING ABOUT IT 
IF I SPIN IT ROUND YOU CAN SEE IT'S GOT A PLAYING CARD ON THE BACK 
NOW IF I TAKE IT APART 
THE BACK DOES IF I'M VERY CAREFUL JUST COME OFF 
AND IF I LEVER AWAY THE BIT OF GLASS TOO 
I CAN ACTUALLY REMOVE THE CARD ITSELF 
AND IT'S A LOT EASIER TO GET A GOOD CLOSE UP ON 
IF I HOLD IT VERY VERY STILL FOR YOU LIKE THAT 
JUST LOOK AT THE WORK IN THAT 
ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY THE CARD IS A KIND OF BACKBOARD 
I DON'T THINK THE PLAYING CARD HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT 
APART FROM THE FACT THAT IT'S STIFFENING UP THE OUTER SURFACE 
AND THE OUTER SURFACE I THINK IS A VERY THINK SLITHER OF IVORY 
A TYPICAL MEDIUM FOR MINIATURE PAINTINGS ON TO WHICH GOUACHE 
WHICH IS A MIXTURE OF WATERCOLOUR AND EGG ALBUMEN IS APPLIED 
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE TREAT ISN'T IT 
WHO COULD HAVE PAINTED IT 
I HAVEN'T GOT THE FAINTEST IDEA 
WHEN COULD THEY HAVE PAINTED IT 
WELL IF YOU LOOK AT THE CUP THAT SHE'S ABOUT TO PASS HIM 
IT'S A CUP WIT NO HANDLES 
IT'S COME OUT OF A TINY LITTLE PORCELAIN POT HERE 
AND SHE'S GOT IN FRONT OF HER 
A PLATEFUL OF MERINGUES OR LITTLE SWEETMEATS 
ALL OF THAT WOULD INDICATE 
THAT THIS THING WAS PAINTED FASHIONABLY IN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY OR ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY 
IT'S A HONEY WHAT'S IT WORTH 
WELL THEY'RE ASKING ONE HUNDRED NINETY FOR IT AND DEPENDING ON WHO DID PAINT IT 
I FANCY IT'S PROBABLY WORTH NEARER ONE THOUSAND TO ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
IT'S A BARGAIN YES 
YES NOD OH GOOD GLAD YOU AGREE 
NOW WHICH TEAM IS GOING TO FIND THE NEXT BARGAIN 
GEMMA PAUL WELCOME TO MY STALL I SEE YOU'RE DOING BARGAIN HUNT TODAY 
YES SIR CAN I INTEREST YOU IN PROBABLY THE GREATEST BARGAIN 
THAT'S EVER BEEN ON THIS PROGRAMME YOU CAN INDEED YOU CAN TRY 
CANS HOW ABOUT THOSE THEN 
BRING BACK SOME MEMORIES AREN'T THEY LOVELY 
THEY'RE HORRIBLE HOW CAN YOU PARDON 
THEY'RE HORRIBLE THEY'RE OIL CANS I KNOW THEY'RE OIL CANS 
THESE ARE A PIECE OF YESTERYEAR 
THEY ARE PART OF OUR MOTORING HERITAGE 
WE'RE IN COVENTRY JAGUAR MOTOR CARS 
THESE ARE GOING TO MAKE YOU A FORTUNE IN THE AUCTION 
PEOPLE WILL BE FALLING OVER THEMSELVES TO BUY THESE 
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THEY ARE TELL ME 
THEY'VE GOT THE QUEEN ELIZABETH STAMP JUST IN THERE YEP 
SO THEY'RE I WOULD THINK THEY'RE MID FIFTIES PERHAPS EARLY SIXTIES 
THEY ARE MINIATURE OIL CANS THIS ONE'S A GILL 
MEASURES A GILL RIGHT 
THAT ONE'S HALF A PINT BUT THEY'RE JUST GREAT THINGS YOU KNOW 
WHO WOULD BUY THESE KIND OF CANS AT AN AUCTION 
A CAR COLLECTOR 
CAN YOU IMAGINE JUST TOPPING UP YOUR FERRARI OR YOUR BENTLEY 
WITH JUST THAT HINT OF CASTROL LUBRICATION THAT'S REQUIRED 
DO PEOPLE STILL USE THESE OF COURSE THEY DO 
I DON'T LIKE THEM CAR FREAKS WILL LOVE THESE 
HONESTLY SERIOUSLY SOMEONE WHO COLLECTS AUTOMOBILIA THEY'RE A WOW 
JUST FEEL THE QUALITY AND I'M ONLY ASKING TWENTY FIVE FOR TWO 
I'VE BOUGHT MANY A CAR THAT NEEDED MANY TOPPINGS UP 
WITH SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THIS 
I'VE BOUGHT CARS THAT HAVE USED MORE OIL THAN THEY HAVE PETROL 
NOW CAN YOU NOT FEEL THE QUALITY THERE 
I'M NOT FEELING IT DO YOU WANT THEM 
WELL I LIKE THEM BUT NOT AT TWENTY FIVE THE PAIR 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN NOT AT TWENTY FIVE 
I THINK THEY'RE JUST A WEE BIT OVERPRICED MR. STALLKEEPER 
WHAT ABOUT IF WE SAID FIFTEEN 
FIFTEEN I'VE GOT A LIVING TO EARN HERE 
SHALL WE SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE AND CALL IT TWENTY 
WHAT IF WE DIDN'T SAY THAT OTHERWISE YOU'D HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT OF THIS 
I'LL HAVE THE TWENTY THEN 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR 
WELL I DO HOPE THE BLUES ARE AS SLICK AT HAGGLING AS THE REDS WERE 
LOOK AT THESE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THESE THEN STAFFORDSHIRE FIGURES 
I DON'T LIKE THEM THEY'RE UGLY 
CATHERINE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THESE 
HONESTLY HONESTLY 
HORRIBLE THEY ARE AH 
I MEAN THEY'RE A PAIR OF OBVIOUSLY STAFFORDSHIRE FIGURES 
PROBABLY ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED IN DATE 
BUT I JUST DON'T GET VERY EXCITED ABOUT THEM 
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU LIKE ABOUT THEM 
THERE'S A BIT OF AGE TO THEM THERE'S NO DAMAGE 
AND THEY'RE A PAIR JUST LIKE US AH ISN'T HE SWEET 
THE THING IS YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOK LIKE THAT DO YOU I'M NOT THAT UGLY 
THE PROBLEM WITH STAFFORDSHIRE IS IT IS COPIED 
YOU GET A LOT OF COPIES AROUND 
ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK THAT THESE ARE A COPY 
BECAUSE THERE ARE COPIES MADE IT DOES START TO CLOUD THE MARKET SLIGHTLY 
AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE QUITE DIFFICULT TO SELL 
BUT I KNOW THAT YOU CAME HERE ON A MISSION 
YOU CAME TO GET YOUR FIGURINES I DID 
THEY'RE UGLY THEY ARE VERY UGLY REALLY UGLY 
REALLY NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE WOULD YOU PUT THEM IN YOUR HOUSE NO 
THAT'S WHAT'S PUTTING ME OFF THEY'RE NOT PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE 
HOW MUCH IS ON THEM HE WANTS ONE HUNDRED FIVE BUT I WOULDN'T PAY THAT 
I'D PROBABLY SAY AROUND SEVENTY EIGHTY SO IF YOU LIKE THEM THEN YOU GO FOR IT 
BUT ON YOUR HEAD BE IT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT REALLY INTERESTED ARE WE 
NOT AT ALL LET'S GO 
EXCUSE ME I'VE BEEN DUMPED 
POOR HUGH HIS BELIEF IN THOSE FIGURES SET HIM BACK EIGHTY FIVE 
THE CONDITION OF WHAT YOU BUY REALLY DOES AFFECT ITS VALUE 
FOR THE BEST ADVICE CHECK OUT OUR WEBSITE 
YOU NEVER KNOW IT MIGHT BE WORTH A FORTUNE 
OR IT MIGHT JUST BE WORTH CHUCKING IN THE SKIP 
RIGHT YOU BOYS HAVE HAD YOUR FUN IT'S MY TURN I REALLY LIKE THESE 
WHY'S THAT THEN 
I DON'T KNOW I THINK THEY'RE CUTE 
I LOVE THE COLOURS ON THE BACKS OF THE SPOONS 
I THINK THEY'RE NICE 
VERY WELL PRESENTED WELL LOOKED AFTER LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
THEY ARE COFFEE SPOONS FROM THE SIZE HOW MUCH ARE THEY ERM 
SEVENTY EIGHT 
THEY'RE ALSO HALLMARKED SILVER AND IT SAVES ME LOOKING 
BECAUSE THE PRICE TAG ON THE BACK THERE SAYS BIRMINGHAM NINETEEN FIFTY SIX 
SO WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE SILVER 
THEY'RE COFFEE SPOONS AND THEN THIS IS A COFFEE BEAN STEM AT THE END 
BUT WHAT JUST LIFTS THESE UP ABOVE THE CROWD IS WE'VE GOT THIS WONDERFUL 
ENAMELLING ON THE BACK OF EACH BOWL AND IT'S ALMOST SHAPED LIKED A CLAM SHELL YEAH 
IF YOU GO AND DAMAGE THAT YOU'VE JUST WRECKED IT IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF GLASS 
IT SHATTERS IF YOU DROP THEM HEAVILY INTO THE SINK OR ON THE FLOOR YOU'VE JUST WRECKED IT 
SO THESE HAVE SURVIVED FIFTY ONE YEARS AND THEY'VE BEEN TREASURED YEP 
THEY'RE LOVELY 
THERE'S A BUT COMING AND THE BUT IS DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE LOOKED AT YOUR TORQUAYWARE 
YEAH WE SAID THAT IF THE ONLY THING YOU'VE GOT TO APOLOGISE FOR 
IS THE PRICE YOU'RE HALFWAY THERE WE'RE HALFWAY THERE WITH THESE BUT AT SEVENTY WHAT WAS IT 
SEVENTY EIGHT SEVENTY EIGHT I THINK YOU HAVE GOT TO APOLOGISE FOR THE PRICE BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF MONEY 
RIGHT I THINK THESE ARE WORTH BETWEEN FORTY AND SIXTY 
THERE'S ANOTHER BUT COMING THAT I THINK IF YOU CAN GET 
ARDENT COLLECTORS OR TWO LADIES I WOULDN'T BE 
SURPRISED IF THESE MADE SEVENTY OR EIGHTY BECAUSE THE ONLY THING YOU'VE GOT TO APOLOGISE FOR IS THE PRICE 
THEY'RE JUST LOVELY I MEAN THE BACK OF THESE BOWLS IS JUST 
REALLY REALLY LOVELY YOU KNOW AND THEY'RE GOOD QUALITY IT'S THE PRICE SO DAD WHAT DO YOU THINK 
AFTER THAT LITTLE BIT OF INTERESTING INFORMATION I DIDN'T KNOW 
THEY WERE COFFEE SPOONS I CAN'T SEE NO REASON WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO GO FOR THEM 
WHAT CAN YOU GET THEM FOR 
I MIGHT OFFER SIXTY AND SEE HOW THAT GOES DOWN 
GOOD LUCK 
THE DEALER WAS HAVING NONE OF GEMMA'S SIXTY OFFER SO SHE EVENTUALLY GOT THE SPOONS FOR SIXTY FIVE 
CATHERINE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS 
NOW LET ME GUESS I DON'T THINK IT WAS YOU THAT CHOSE THAT IT WAS ME 
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL 
IT'S GORGEOUS OH I COULDN'T HAVE CHOSEN BETTER MYSELF 
THAT'S A REALLY PRETTY LITTLE EVENING BAG OR EVENING PURSE I SHOULD SAY 
WHAT A STUNNING PIECE I REALLY LOVE THIS IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE CONTINENTAL PERHAPS MADE IN FRANCE 
AND I SHOULD THINK IT'S ART NOUVEAU ART DECO BUT IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL 
VERY INTRICATE BEADWORK EVERY SINGLE LITTLE PIECE IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY 
YOU CAN SEE ALL THIS WONDERFUL COLOURED BEADWORK ALL OVER 
AND THEN IT'S GOT THIS LOVELY SORT OF MOUNT AT THE TOP WHERE YOU'VE GOT THE CLASP WHICH IS IVORY OR HORN 
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY IVORY AND THEN IT'S GOT THE LOVELY RELIEF OF THE COLOURED DAISIES AS WELL 
IT LOOKS FROM A DISTANCE THAT IT'S PROBABLY A BUG 
SORT OF LIKE THE EGYPTIAN BUG ISN'T IT 
LIKE A SCARAB 
THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT IT IS 
NOW HUGH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS IT'S A BIT GIRLY FOR ME 
IT'S NOT YOUR CUP OF TEA 
IT'S NOT BUT YOU'VE HAD YOUR PIECE NOW IT'S TIME FOR JEANETTE TO HAVE A LITTLE GO 
WHY WERE YOU DRAWN TOWARDS THIS 
IT'S COLOURFUL IT'S JUST DELICATE IT'S LOVELY 
IT'S GOT REALLY NICE COLOURS LOVELY BEADS IT'S SO DELICATE 
IS IT SOMETHING YOU WOULD HAVE BOUGHT FOR YOURSELF 
I WOULD BECAUSE IT REALLY IS NICE SOMETHING TO GO OUT IN THE EVENING 
THE THING AGAINST IT IS THE MORE AND MORE I LOOK 
AT IT I CAN SEE THAT THERE'S QUITE A FEW BEADS MISSING THERE IS YEAH 
MORE ON THE FRINGE AT THE BOTTOM LOTS OF THE BEADS HAVE COME OFF AND THE PROBLEM IS IT IS REALLY 
REALLY HARD TO REPAIR SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND I THINK IT WILL PUT 
SOME COLLECTORS OFF BUT NEVERTHELESS AN OVERALL VERY VERY BEAUTIFUL PIECE AND A FANTASTIC FIND I HAVE TO SAY 
HOW MUCH ARE THEY ASKING SEVENTY EIGHT 
SEVENTY EIGHT I MEAN IN PERFECT CONDITION IT COULD MAKE HUNDREDS I MEAN IT COULD REALLY TAKE OFF SO IF YOU WANT IT

LOVELY JUBBLY YOU LOVE THIS BIT 
YOU LOVE SHOPPING TRIPS I DO WHAT HAVE YOU GOT IN MIND 
OH I'VE GOT THE PERFECT ITEM AND YOU KNOW ME I ALWAYS COME UP WITH THE GOODS 
YOU CERTAINLY WILL CATHERINE 
ANYWAY I'M GOING TO COME UP WITH THE GOODS TOO I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU TO ALTHORP HOUSE STAND BY 
ALTHORP IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE 
IT'S LISTED IN THE DOOMSDAY BOOK AS ALLERS THORPE ALLER WAS A SAXON LORD 
AND THORPE IS DANISH AND APPARENTLY MEANS DAUGHTER'S SETTLEMENT 
ALTHORP HAS BEEN HOME TO THE SPENCER FAMILY FOR FIVE CENTURIES AND TWENTY GENERATIONS 
NOT SURPRISINGLY FOR A FAMILY WHO'VE LIVED SO LONG IN A SINGLE PLACE 
THERE'S A CONSIDERABLE ACCUMULATION OF ART 
HERE IN THE LONG PICTURE GALLERY THE POPULATION IS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY 
PORTRAITS DATING FROM THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY PORTRAITS OF THE GREAT AND GOOD AND ALSO THE FAMILY 
IF YOU WERE VISITING THIS PICTURE GALLERY AND YOU FELT A BIT TIRED YOU MIGHT INDEED NEED TO SIT DOWN 
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THIS SUITE OF FURNITURE IS COMPLETELY 
ALIEN TO THE ROOM BECAUSE THEY WERE MADE FOR THE SPENCER'S LONDON HOUSE 
THESE ARE EXTREMELY SOPHISTICATED EIGHTEENTH CENTURY PIECES OF FURNITURE 
IN FACT THIS CHAIR IS JUST ONE OF A SUITE OF FORTY PIECES 
THEY WERE DESIGNED BY A MAN CALLED JAMES STEWART WHO WAS AN ARCHITECT 
AN ANTIQUARIAN AN ARTIST AND COMPLETELY BONKERS ABOUT GREECE AND IN PARTICULAR ATHENS 
HE SPENT YEARS THERE STUDYING THE ARCHITECTURE AND HENCE HIS NICKNAME 
A BIT LATER ON BECAME JAMES ATHENIAN STEWART 
WHAT'S SOPHISTICATED ABOUT THEM REALLY IS THE FRAMES 
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CARVING THIS TRAIL OF FOLIAGE ARE ACTUALLY A TRAIL OF CLASSICAL GARIA 
AND THEY LEAD TO A STRAND OF BEADS AND THEN AN ELONGATED SECTION OF 
ACANTHUS AND THAT ACANTHUS IS THEN REPEATED IN THE ENDS OF THE ARMS 
IF I TURN THAT CORNER TOWARDS YOU YOU CAN SEE IT'S BEEN SHAPED LIKE THAT AND IS CARVED WITH SOMETHING 
CALLED AN ANTHENIAN NOTHING MORE CLASSICAL THAN THAT PIECE OF FOLIAGE 
THE SHAPE OF THE LEG OVERALL IS FRENCH BUT IF WE WANTED TO CHECK THAT IT IS AN ENGLISH CHAIR 
THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO TURN IT OVER WHICH WE'LL DO VERY VERY GENTLY LIKE THIS 
AND REVEAL THE UNDERSIDE AND WHAT DO WE SEE 
ACTUALLY QUITE A DULL AND ROUGH SORT OF LIME WASHED INNER SURFACE 
BUT THESE BABIES THESE OPEN STRETCHERS ARE DEFINITELY AN ENGLISH CHARACTERISTIC 
IT ALL LOOKS FAIRLY ROUGH AND READY UNDERNEATH HERE BECAUSE NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN 
THE STRENGTH OF THE CHAIR IS IN THIS RAIL HERE WHICH IS TENONED 
INTO THE FRONT LEG AND THE BACK LEG AND ALL THIS CARVING ON THE OUTSIDE IS ESSENTIALLY JUST SHOW WOOD 
THAT'S WHERE THE CRAFTS PERSON HAS DONE HIS CARVING AND SIMPLY APPLIED IT TO THE STRONG RAIL 
THEY ARE AN ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY SET OF CHAIRS 
THE SUITE WAS ACTUALLY MADE FOR THE SPENCER'S LONDON HOUSE 
SPENCER HOUSE WHICH THEY STILL OWN BUT THEY MOVED OUT 
AT THE END OF THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AND TOOK MOST OF THE CONTENTS HERE 
TO ALTHORP AND JUST AS WELL THEY DID BECAUSE DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR AN INCENDIARY DEVICE FELL ON 
SPENCER HOUSE AND HAD THE FURNITURE NOT BEEN HERE IT COULD'VE BEEN BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS COURTESY OF ADOLF 
VERY LUCKY SURVIVORS INDEED 
LET'S HOPE OUR TEAMS SURVIVE JUST AS LUCKILY OVER AT TODAY'S AUCTION 
WELL WE'RE PLEASED TO BE AT BIGWOOD'S AUCTIONEERS IN STRATFORD WITH CHRISTOPHER IRONMONGER 
CHRISTOPHER GOOD MORNING TIM WELCOME 
WE'RE DELIGHTED TO BE HERE 
NOW GEMMA AND PAUL'S MOTTO WARE I MEAN YOU'RE A LONG WAY FROM THE WEST COUNTRY HERE AREN'T YOU 
WE ARE GETTING RATHER A LOT OF THIS IN FACT WE'VE GOT A FAIRLY LARGE 
COLLECTION IN OUR STORE ROOMS BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE SORT OF STRIKING A VERY GOOD NOTE 
AH ANYWAY THEY GOT SIX PIECES HE WHO HESITATES IS LOST 
ONE THING TO POINT OUT A LITTLE UNFORTUNATE PLATE CUP NO SAUCER 
AH NO SAUCER A LITTLE BIT OF A DISJOINTED COLLECTION BUT WE'VE SAID TEN TO TWENTY 
AND YOU'RE QUITE OPTIMISTIC AT TEN TO TWENTY FOR IT YES 
THEY PAID THIRTY YES WELL I THINK WE MIGHT STRUGGLE 
THE TWO CASTROL OIL CANS I KNOW YOU TRAINED FOR A LONG TIME 
TO REACH THE ABSOLUTE PINNACLE OF EXPERTISE IN THE FINE ARTS BUSINESS RIGHT 
SO WHEN A COUPLE OF OLD OIL CANS COME IN HOW DO YOU FEEL 
IT TAKES ALL SORTS I SUPPOSE THERE'LL BE SOMEONE WHO'LL WANT 
THEM BUT THEY'RE NOT SOMETHING VERY INSPIRING I ADMIT I THINK WE'VE SAID EIGHT TO TWELVE 
TWENTY PAID I MEAN TO WITHIN A SPIT THEY'LL GET THEIR MONEY BACK 
THEY MIGHT I DO QUITE LIKE THIS SET OF BEAN END COFFEE SPOONS THOUGH 
YES THEY'RE NICE THEY ARE GOOD ORDER THE ENAMEL WORK IS ALL INTACT THERE'S NO PARTICULAR SIGN 
OF ANY DAMAGE BUT WE DO SEE QUITE A LOT OF BEAN END COFFEE SPOONS AND WE'VE SAID TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE 
HAVE YOU SIXTY FIVE THEY PAID I THINK A BIT TOO MUCH THERE 
THAT IS THE SORT OF RETAIL FIGURE FOR THOSE OBJECTS 
IT IS IT IS IT IS YEAH 
EVERY SIDEBOARD IN THE LAND HAS GOT A SET OF BEAN END COFFEE 
IN THE TOP DRAWER AND THEY NEVER GET USED NO 
RIDICULOUS THEY'RE VERY ATTRACTIVE YES THEY ARE 
I FANCY THEY'RE GOING TO NEED THEIR BONUS BUY SO LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
GEMMA AND PAUL YOU GAVE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE TO PHILIP SERRELL WHO'S GONE OUT AND SHOPPED TILL HE DROPPED YES YES 
RIGHT WHAT DID YOU GET I BOUGHT THESE TIM 
GAMING COUNTERS NINETEENTH CENTURY MOTHER OF PEARL GAMING COUNTERS AND I PAID TWENTY FOR THEM 
I THINK THEY'RE CHEAP LOOK WHERE THEY'RE ENGRAVED AND 
THE BEAUTY OF THESE IS THAT PEOPLE COLLECT GAMING COUNTERS BUT THE OTHER THING THAT IF YOU CAN IMAGINE 
THOSE NINETEEN T. H. C. CADDIES AND BOXES YOU CAN BUY THESE AND IF YOU'VE GOT 
SOMETHING MISSING YOU CAN CUT IT UP AND THERE'S YOUR REPLACEMENT 
I JEST NOT YOU KNOW 
SO A GAMING COUNTER WOULD HAVE BEEN USED FOR WHAT THEN PHIL 
IT'S LIKE I SUPPOSE A CASINO CHIP 
BASICALLY KIND OF GRAND COUNTRY HOUSE KIND OF PARTIES WHERE THEY'D BE GAMBLING WITH CARDS 
AND THIS WOULD ENABLE YOU TO KEEP THE SCORE YES 
EXQUISITELY MADE THOUGH THEY'RE LOVELY THINGS I THINK THERE'S EIGHTEEN 
POUND EACH A POUND EACH IT'S NO MONEY AND YOU'VE GOT THE DOUBLE WHAMMY 
OF SOMEONE MIGHT BUY THESE BECAUSE THEY'RE A COLLECTOR OF THEM 
OR BECAUSE THEY RESTORE BITS OF MOTHER OF PEARL INLAID FURNITURE AND THE LIKE 
WELL IT'S A LOT CHEAPER THAN GOING TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND DIVING FOR THE SHELL 
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA ABSOLUTELY 
YOU CAN COME TO STRATFORD BUY AN ACREAGE OF MOTHER OF PEARL 
AND COMPLETELY RE DO YOUR IVORIES THAT'S YOUR THEORY PHIL ISN'T IT ABSOLUTELY 
YOU'VE WATCHED HIS LIPS HOW MUCH PROFIT THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SEE I THINK THEY COULD DOUBLE UP 
YOU RECKON THEY COULD DOUBLE UP YEP 
SO EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX MAYBE THAT'S THE RANGE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE NOW WE'LL FIND OUT FROM THE AUCTIONEER 
FOR YOU GUYS AT HOME WHAT HE THINKS THEY'RE WORTH 
O. K. CHRISTOPHER THERE YOU GO EIGHTEEN OF THOSE JOKERS 
WELL I'LL BE OFF TO THE TABLE TIM 
DOUBLE YOUR MONEY THAT'S WHAT WE WANT YOU TO DO WE NEED TO 
ARE THEY WORTH ONE EACH WE'VE SAID FIVE TO TEN THE LOT HAVE YOU YES 
BIT OF A TEASER FOR THAT THAT'S PRIOR TO THE GAME I THINK 
I MEAN YOU SEE THEM SOME PLACES MARKED UP AT TEN P. EACH 
OTHER PLACES AT ONE EACH I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE WORTH 
WELL I THINK IT'S JUST WHETHER SOMEBODY TAKES TO THEM 
O. K. NOW THE BLUES JEANETTE AND HUGH 
THEY WENT FOR THIS REVOLVING ENTREE DISH I MEAN IT'S A GOOD PIECE OF EDWARDIAN KIT ISN'T IT 
IT IS BUT WHO WANTS IT 
IN A SILVER PLATE IT'S SLIGHTLY HARD WORK 
ALSO GOT A DENT THERE 
A SLIGHT DENT THERE SO IT'S NOT IN THE BEST CONDITION TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE WE'VE SAID 
I THINK THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT IT LOOKS AS IF IT OUGHT TO BE WORTH MORE 
THEY PAID THIRTY FIVE THEY'LL BE DISAPPOINTED AT THAT 
BUT I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE A BURNER UNDERNEATH AND AS I SAY WHO WANTS IT 
THAT'S THE PROBLEM BUT WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO 
NOW THE STAFFORDSHIRE FIGURES WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THOSE MODERN 
DO YOU THEY DON'T SEEM ANY AGE WE'VE PUT THEM AS VICTORIAN STYLE 
YES THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF THESE ABOUT I'M AFRAID AND WE THINK THEY ARE REPRODUCTION ONES 
SO THEY COULD HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES NINETEEN EIGHTIES NINETEEN SIXTIES YEAH 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO PINPOINT BUT THEY'RE NOT NINETEENTH CENTURY NO THEY'RE NOT 
THEY'RE INCREDIBLY CLEAN ON THEIR BOTTOMS AREN'T THEY YES 
UNDERNEATH THERE ISN'T ANY SIGN OF WEAR ETC 
THE OTHER THING IS THIS RATHER HORRID GILDING TOO 
YES THAT WOULDN'T BE LIKE THAT IF THEY WERE NINETEENTH CENTURY ONES 
NO SO THERE WE GO THEN THEY'RE EFFECTIVELY BOGUS 
WHICH WILL BE A BLOW TO THE TEAM BECAUSE EIGHTY FIVE IS WHAT THEY PAID 
WE'VE SAID TWENTY TO THIRTY TWENTY TO THIRTY 
THERE IS A BIG PIT OPENING UP UNDER THESE PEOPLE 
AND LASTLY THIS LITTLE NUMBER WHICH I'M NOT ALTOGETHER SURE IS YOUR COLOUR ACTUALLY 
NOT EXACTLY TIM NO 
NO BUT IT'S GOT NICE BEADWORK AND THE JET IF SOMEBODY'S LOOKING FOR 
A NICE EVENING BAG IT'S GOT DETAIL TO IT THAT THEY WOULD FIND APPEALING 
SOMEBODY LOOKING FOR SOME OLD BAG ANYWAY HOW MUCH 
WE'VE SAID TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE 
WELL THIRTY EIGHT THEY PAID THEY'RE WITHIN KIND OF SIGHT FOR THAT OBJECT 
BUT FOR THE PAIR OF STAFFORDSHIRE FIGURES THEY'RE WAY OUT 
AND NOT SO BRILLIANT ON THE ENTREE DISH 
SO MY BET IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED A DECENT BONUS BUY LET'S GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT 
JEANETTE AND HUGH YOU MANAGED TO SPEND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT YES WE DID YES 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO WENT TO CATHERINE WHAT DID SHE SPEND IT ON 
D. A. D. A. WOW 
THAT'S A BIT SMALL 
THESE ARE FABULOUS THEY ARE GEORGIAN GENTLEMAN'S TWEEZERS 
IN THE SHAPE OF A BOOT AREN'T THEY BRILLIANT 
THEY ARE THAT IS LOVELY THEY ARE SO GORGEOUS HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH 
WELL I PAID ONLY NINE FOR THESE 
THEY WANTED TWENTY AND THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE YOU A PROFIT DEFINITELY WOW 
FAMOUS LAST WORDS BUT THEY WILL THEY'VE GOT TO DOUBLE THEIR MONEY 
HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE A PAIR OF THOSE NEVER 
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL THEY'RE REALLY INGENIOUS AND I JUST LOVE THEM 
THESE ARE OBJECTS THAT WOULD BE IN THE GEORGIAN BEAUTICIAN'S PARLOUR 
ABSOLUTELY YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU WERE A GEORGIAN GENTLEMAN WITH THESE WONDERFUL PIECES 
WHY CAN'T A WOMAN PLUCK HER HAIR WITH TWEEZERS LIKE THAT THEN 
SHE COULD BUT NO THESE ARE DEFINITELY FOR MEN 
YEAH IT'S THE SHAPE ISN'T IT DEFINITELY 
YOU DON'T LOOK VERY IMPRESSED WITH THEM THOUGH BIT SMALL 
I LIKE THEM THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE A PROFIT I THINK THEY'RE GOOD 
YOU COULD WELL BE ON TO A WINNER THERE 
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUCTIONEER THINKS ABOUT THE TWEEZERS 
SO IF YOU'VE GOT ANY UNWANTED BODY HAIR THEN THIS IS YOUR MOMENT 
NOT PARTICULARLY I THINK I'LL HANG ON TO MINE 
NO I MEAN IT'S A PRETTY LITTLE NOVELTY ITEM PAIR OF STEEL TWEEZERS IN THE FORM OF A LADY'S LOWER LEG 
DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE SORT OF ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTIES ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTIES 
I WOULD THINK IT PROBABLY IS YES AND I WOULD SAY TWENTY THIRTY AS AN ESTIMATE ON IT 
BRILLIANT CATHERINE PAID NINE 
OH RIGHT I THINK WITH THE RIGHT PERSON THEY COULD GO WELL YEAH 
WELL SHE KNOWS HER ONIONS ARE YOU GOING TO BE PLUCKING THE BIDS FROM THE AIR TODAY I WILL ALL RIGHT 
IT'S NOT VERY OFTEN IN THESE AUCTIONS THAT YOU GET A CHANCE OF 
HAVING AN EXAMINATION OF A SERIOUSLY OLD FIREARM 
NOW THIS IS SOMETHING CALLED A FOWLING PIECE 
THE SORT OF SHOTGUN THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED AROUND ABOUT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY OR ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY 
IT'S EXQUISITELY MADE 
IT'S GOT WHAT'S CALLED A PERCUSSION CAP ACTION 
AND IF I COCK IT BY PULLING BACK THAT HAMMER HEAD LIKE THAT 
IT REVEALS A NIPPLE 
AND WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE IS TO PUT A LITTLE COPPER CAP ON TOP OF THAT NIPPLE 
THAT WAS FILLED WITH MAGNESIUM AND WHEN YOU PULL THE TRIGGER THE HAMMER DROPS 
SQUEEZES THE MAGNESIUM FILLED CAP 
WHICH IGNITES THE GUNPOWDER WHICH HAS BEEN PACKED DOWN THE BARREL 
WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THIS LOT IS THAT IT INCLUDES 
THIS EXTRAORDINARILY DELIGHTFUL LITTLE FOWLING PIECE 
LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE IN SCALE 
HERE'S THE ADULT VARIETY 
AND THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE FOR AN EXTREMELY LUCKY YOUNGSTER 
AND MORE TO THE POINT IT'S RATHER BETTER MADE THAN HIS FATHER'S GUN 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE STOCK THAT'S BEEN MADE OF SOLID BURL WALNUT 
WALNUT WHICH IS VERY SPECIFICALLY SELECTED FOR GUN STOCKS 
YOU WANT A DECORATIVE STOCK WITH LOTS OF WHIRLS AND TWIRLS IN THE GRAIN 
BUT STRONG ENOUGH TO TAKE THE RECOIL OF THE PIECE WHEN IT'S ACTUALLY FIRED 
BUT WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BARRELS 
IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY YOU SEE ALL THIS SQUIGGLY RATHER RUSTY TEXTURED NATURE TO THAT BARREL 
THAT'S BECAUSE THIS BARREL HAS BEEN MADE OUT OF ROLLED WIRE 
WIRE WAS BOUND AROUND A CORE AND THE WIRE WAS HEATED 
AND IT WAS THEN HAMMERED AND THEN SOME MORE WIRE WAS BOUND ROUND 
AND THAT WAS HAMMERED AND THIS TYPE OF BARREL IS CALLED A DAMASCUS BARREL 
I LOVE IT BECAUSE THE FITTINGS ON THIS ARE MADE OF CHASED BRASS 
YOU CAN SEE THE BRASS RUNNING THROUGH THERE 
EVEN WITH THIS LITTLE PINEAPPLE INSET ON THE END OF THE TRIGGER GUARD 
THE OTHER NICE THING ABOUT THESE TWO GUNS IS THE ESTIMATE 
THEY'RE ESTIMATED AT THIRTY TO FORTY FOR THE TWO 
NOW I'M NO FIREARMS EXPERT 
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT AT THIRTY TO FORTY THESE TWO GUNS WOULD BE A BARGAIN 
AND I CONFIDENTLY PREDICT THAT THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE A LOT MORE IN THE AUCTION BOOM BOOM 
GEMMA AND PAUL NOW PAUL YOU'RE LOOKING RATHER SHIFTY 
THAT'S BECAUSE I'VE JUST DONE A NIGHT SHIFT 
YOU WENT FOR ALL THAT TORQUAY MOTTO WARE DIDN'T YOU I DID YES

AND HE'S FINDING IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SHIFT I'LL BUY A BIT OFF HIM WILL YOU YEAH
