OH HI NAT 
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING US TODAY 
WE'RE OFF TO VISIT THE STARS FOR A BIT OF SPACE WALKING 
SPACE WALKING 
HIGH UP IN THE SKY 
SPACE WALKING 
THIS IS HOW IT FEELS TO FLY 
EARTH LOOKS VERY SMALL AND FAR 
CLOSER TO THE EVENING STAR 
SPACE WALKING TONIGHT YEAH 
WE'RE OFF TO SPACE TODAY 
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT WHAT IT MUST FEEL LIKE TO WALK IN SPACE 
THESE ASTRONAUTS HARDLY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE WALKING AT ALL 
THEY ALMOST LOOK LIKE THEY'RE FLOATING 
THAT MUST BE REALLY GOOD TO WALK IN SPACE LIKE THAT 
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DO SOME SPACE WALKING 
WE'RE GOING TO LIFT THIS LEG UP 
AND THEN LOWER IT DOWN REALLY SLOWLY 
AND DO THE SAME WITH THE OTHER LEG 
UP AND DOWN 
UP AND DOWN 
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL YOU DON'T FALL OVER 
NOW LET'S USE OUR ARMS AND DO THE SAME MOVEMENTS 
BIG SLOW SWINGS 
YEAH THAT'S IT 
THAT'S IT 
WE'RE SPACE WALKING 
IT FEELS REALLY GOOD 
YES 
NOW EARTH IS THE PLANET WHERE WE LIVE 
WHEN ASTRONAUTS LOOK BACK AT IT FROM SPACE THIS IS WHAT THEY SEE 
THE FURTHER AWAY THEY GO THE SMALLER THE PLANET LOOKS 
NOW LET'S CURL UP OUR BODIES INTO A SMALL BALL REALLY SMALL 
AS IF WE'RE A PLANET IN THE DISTANCE 
LET'S GRADUALLY GRADUALLY STRETCH OUT INTO A STAR 
YES LET'S REALLY STRETCH OUT TO EACH POINT 
MAYBE WE'LL BE ABLE TO TWINKLE 
TWINKLE 
LET'S DO THAT AGAIN 
STRETCH OUR BODIES INTO A SMALL CIRCLE LIKE THIS 
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO REACH OUT INTO A STAR 
I LIKE THIS 
YES 
NOW LET'S DO SOME MORE SPACE WALKING 
SLOWLY 
THAT'S RIGHT 
I'M FEELING GOOD AGAIN AND I'M FEELING YOU'RE FEELING GOOD TOO 
SO LET'S PUT ALL OUR MOVES TOGETHER WITH THE MUSIC 
SPACE WALKING HIGH UP IN THE SKY 
SPACE WALKING THAT'S IT 
THIS IS HOW IT FEELS TO FLY 
NOW WE'RE GOING TO CURL DOWN 
THE EARTH LOOKS REALLY SMALL AND FAR 
WE'RE CLOSER TO THE EVENING STARS

IT'LL COME BACK AGAIN 
SO DON'T WORRY IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT IT THE FIRST TIME 
YOU WILL WHEN YOU HEAR IT A FEW MORE TIMES 
OF COURSE IF WE'RE GOING INTO SPACE 
WE'LL NEED TO WEAR SPECIAL SUITS 
ASTRONAUTS WEAR SPACE SUITS WHICH COVER THE WHOLE OF THEIR BODIES 
AND A CLEAR HELMET OVER THEIR HEADS 
GREAT IT'S TIME TO BLAST OFF
