THE CONDITIONS 
IT 
WAS NOT EASY L. WAS HAPPY TO GET IN THE FOUR UNDER PAR IT IS THE 
BEST I 
HAVE BEEN 
IN TWO 
ROUNDS AT THE 
AUGUSTA THE WIND

AFFECT ME 
UNTIL THE FIFTEENTH WE THOUGHT IT WAS

ERRORS IN CERTAIN 
AREAS AROUND THIS GOLF COURSE BUT 
I STILL MADE BIRDIE SO I AM VERY

REASON FOR YOU NOT TO 
BE CHIPPER WHERE DOES THIS PLAY 
SUE FOR THE WEEKEND 
I AM VERY 
HAPPY WITH THAT L. AM WORRIED ABOUT 
MYSELF AND THAT IS THE MAIN THING 
THIS GOLF COURSE IS RIGHT ON THE 
EDGE CRAZY THINGS CAN HAPPEN OUT 
THERE YOU HAVE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT 
YOURSELF AND NOT ABOUT ANYTHING 
ELSE THAT IS GOING ON OR WHAT THE 
LEADERS ARE DOING BECAUSE IF YOU 
ARE YOU ARE WASTING ENERGY YOU 
NEED EVERY OUNCE TO BE FOCUSED ON 
GETTING THAT GOLF BALL INTO 
SPECIFIC AREAS THAT IS THE 
CHALLENGE OF IT THAT IS THE FUN 
THAT IS WHY I PLAY WELL AROUND THE 
GOLF COURSE SUCH AS THIS THE 
TOUGHER THE BETTER 
IT GOING 
TOUGHER THE BETTER KEEP IT GOING CHEERS A POLICE FOR HISTORY AND FOR 
LEGENDS TO PASS THROUGH PLACE 
ALIVE WITH MEMORIES THE MASTERS IAN POULTER FIVE UNDER FOR THE 
TOURNAMENT THIRD PLACE HE MIGHT 
GET LUCKY HE MIGHT GET UNLUCKY IT 
IS A MUCH EASIER PUTT FROM UP HIGH 
THAN IT IS FROM DOWN THERE IT IS 
NOT A TRICKY PUTT FROM THERE NO 
WORRIES ABOUT THE SPEED YOU WOULD NEED A OVEN GLOVES TO 
HOLD THAT PUTTER TODAY SAM WAYNE 
GRADY HAS COME DOWN FROM THE STUDIO 
I WALKED DOWN FROM THE STUDIO WITH 
PETER IT IS QUITE BREEZY OUT THERE 
PLAYERS WHO STILL HAVE NINE HOLES

TRAP THERE HE GOES TIGER 
ON THE FAIRWAY NOT THIS TIME HE 
HAS MISSED IT BY A FIT IT HAS NOT 
GOT ANY OF RUN DOWN THE HILL SO HE 
HAS MISSED THE DOWN SLOPE KEN HAS 
BEEN LOOKING AT THE BUNKERS THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THEY 
ARE AUGUSTA NATIONAL THE PINS ARE 
ALWAYS 
CUT IN 
THE CORNERS 
THIS ONE 
HAS JUST 
FOUR YARDS 
FROM THE 
OF 
THE GREEN 
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE 
PINPOINT ACCURATE THE GREEN IS 
GUARDED BY BUNKER IT IS 
EASY TO 
GET GOBBLED UP BY THAT NOT MUCH 
GREEN TO WORK WITH THE WAY YOU 
PLAY THIS SHOT YOU DO NOT WANT TO 
PLOP THE BALL 
IN FRONT 
OF YOU 
OR 
SNACK 
IT ON 
THE FRINGE 
YOU OPEN 
THE CLUB FACE UP 
SO THE 
BALL POPS 
UP IN 
THE AIR 
AND YOU 
GET EXTRA 
UP IN THE AIR AND YOU GET EXTRA SPIN ON IT JUST LOOK AT THE SAND 
SNOWY WHITE YOU COULD BE ON POOLE 
BEACH CUT RIGHT ACROSS IT AND SEE 
IF YOU CAN FLOAT IT UP BUT YOU DO 
NOT WANT TO BE PLUGGED IN THAT FACE 
FACE OPEN CUT UNDER IT JUST ABOUT 
O. K. YOU HAVE GOT TO BE PINPOINT 
ACCURATE OCCASIONALLY YOU GOING TO 
BE IN THE SITUATION IF YOU ATTACK 
THE FLAGS BUT IT IS BEST AVOIDED WE SEE A LOT OF PLAYERS WEARING 
SUNGLASSES IN THE BUNKERS BECAUSE 
THE SAND IS SO BRIGHT WITH THE 
GLARE FROM THE SUN HE HAS A GOOD LINE THAT WAS A 
BEAUTIFUL SHOT TWO BEAUTIFUL SHOTS 
FROM NICK DOUGHERTY AND PREJUDICE LITTLE SHOT FROM LUKE 
DONALD AT PICTURESQUE LITTLE 
SHORT TREACHEROUS LITTLE SHOT 
TWO ROUNDS IN THE SIXTIES FOR 
DONALD AND TWO THOUSAND FIVE WHEN HE FINISHED 
THIRD TREMENDOUS EFFORT FRED FRED COUPLES ON SIXTEEN FOR EAGLE A BIG 
SWING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT COME ON 
FRED HE NEEDS SOME HELP COMING IN 
HAS CONSECUTIVE CUT STREAK IS IN 
JEOPARDY IT IS FORTY FOUR PLUS TIES OR ONLY ANYONE WITHIN TEN SHOTS OF THE LEAD AT FIVE OVER HE NEEDS AT LEAST ONE MORE IAN POULTER FOR ANOTHER BIRDIE PUTT TO GET WITHIN THREE OF THE LEAD MY GOODNESS HOW DID THAT STAY OUT A SUPERB 
ROUND OF SIXTY NINE SEVENTY YESTERDAY 
PLAYED A PRACTICE ROUND WITH TREVOR 
IMMELMAN AND JUSTIN ROSE TWO WEEKS 
AGO AND 
THEY ALL DID PARTICULARLY 
WELL EXCELLENT ROUND 
MARK O'MEARA 
I THINK HE MIGHT NEED THIS TO 
MAKE THE CUT HE IS FIVE OVER HE 
HOLED ONE ON THIS GREEN TO WIN FIVE 
YEARS AGO 
BUT THAT DID NOT GOING 
A POOR DAY FOR MARK A GREAT 
COMPETITOR JUSTIN ROSE AFTER THAT SECOND SHOT 
INTO THE BUNKER IT IT ALMOST TOO 
GOOD THREE LEVELS HERE ON THIS 
NINTH GREEN AND THE PIN IS RIGHT 
UP ON THE TOP LEVEL THIRTY FEET BELOW 
THE FLAG ONE OF THE AMATEURS IN THE FIELD 
HE IS ON SIX OVER LOTS OF HIS 
FAMILY ARE HERE SUPPORTING I I THOUGHT I SAW THAT ONCE HE FINISHED 
THIS TOURNAMENT HE WAS GIVING AWAY 
AMATEUR GOLF TO CONCENTRATE ON HIS 
BUSINESS HERE WE HAVE THE AMATEURS 
MICHAEL THOMSON MAY MAKE THE CUT 
TRIP COONEY HE HAD AN EIGHTY TODAY 
KUEHNE THOMSON STILL 
HAS A 
FEW 
HOLES TO GO TIGER GOING A BIT LEFT TRYING TO 
CUT IT IN THAT IS CUTTING IN A 
LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH WILL IT CATCH 
THE GREEN YES 
THE FLAG WAS ONLY 
THREE FOOT OFF THE RIGHT HAND SIDE 
YESTERDAY JUSTIN ROSE FOR HIS PAR SUCH FINE 
TOLERANCES JUST A FRACTION OUT 
WITH HIS STROKE EARLY STARTERS 
HAVE HAD A BIT OF AN ADVANTAGE 
TREVOR IMMELMAN CERTAINLY MAKING 
THE MOST OF THAT HE HAS JUST HAD 
ONE BOGEY ON HIS CARD OVER THE 
OPENING TWO GAMES 
LUKE DONALD 
THIS IS FOR PAR NOT FOR BIRDIE 
LOOK AT THAT THAT IS HOW PREJUDICE 
THESE GREENS ARE TREACHEROUS 
THE HOLE WAS FIVE HUNDRED FIVE YARDS SO I DO NOT 
THINK HE DROVE IT FROM THERE I I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY MORE RUN 
TO EXTEND THE TEE MORE ROOM 
THIS IS BOGEY TO GO PLUS THREE 
FOR THE TOURNAMENT HE IS STILL NOT 
OUT OF IT THE FORECAST IS NOT 
GREAT FOR THE WEEKEND ANYTHING CAN 
HAPPEN BUT IF YOU ARE NOT THERE

WOULD BE GOOD TIGER GIVING IT 
PLENTY OF THOUGHT 
ALMOST ANYTHING 
IT IS MADE DIFFICULT BY THE HOLE 
SITTING DOWN THERE IN THE SHADOWS YOU SEE IT TIPTOEING UP TO THE PUTT 
AND THEN YOU THINK IT REACHES BUT 
THEN IT SPEED UP SPEEDS UP HE DID NOT COME NOW HE HAS LEFT AND EIGHT FOOT DOWN HILL AND EIGHT FOOT SHOT THAT IS FROM 
THE MAN CONSIDERED TO BE THE BEST 
IN THE BUSINESS GOOD SOLID NINE IRON NOT A BAD SHOT HE HAD A BEAUTIFUL SHARING HERE YESTERDAY SHARING THAT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF RIGHT TO LEFT IT COULD GET A BIT OF BOUNCE IT GOT A BIT OF ROLL THAT IS GOOD PER A WE HAVE SEEN A FEW GUYS MISS 
SHORT PUTTS TODAY SO THAT WAS VERY 
WELL READ BY DOUGHERTY DID THE BALL IN WHAT HAPPENED THERE CONSTERNATION IT IS NOT HARD FOR THE BALL TO MOVE 
THE GREENS ARE VERY THIN AND VERY 
TAIK LEE CAT TIGHTLY CUT IF HE 
HAS CAUSED IT TO MOVE AND GROUNDED 
HIS PUTTER THEN HE HAS TO REPLACE 
IT 
QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO YOU HAD IT TO LEAVE IT WHERE IT WAS BUT NOW 
HE HAS TO REPLACE IT I HAVE JUST HEARD THAT BERNHARD 
LANGER WAS PENALISED YESTERDAY 
PENALISED YESTERDAY FULL BALL 
MOVING FOR BALL MOVING L. WISH WE COULD HEAR WHAT IS GOING ON HE HAS HAD TO REPLACE IT IT IS A 
ONE SHOT PENALTY AND HE HAS TO 
REPLACE IT 
THERE IS HARDLY 
ANYTHING TO BALANCE THE BALL ON HE HAS GROUNDED THE CLUB ONCE THAT 
PUTTER GOOD ON THE GROUND GOES 
ON THE GROUND HE IS DEEMED TO HAVE 
ADDRESSED IT THE BALL MOVES 
I DO 
NOT THINK HE TOUCHED THE BALL BUT 
RULES IS RULES ONE C. PACE THE MAR KARAK THE BALL IS 
IN PLAY ONCE HE PICKS THE MARKER 
UP THE BALLS ARE BLOWN ABOUT BY THE FORCE OF THE WIND IT IS THE THIRD TIME SINCE I HAVE BEEN OUT ON THE CHAMPIONSHIP TOUR HE IS FIVE OVER NOW HE IS IN 
DANGER OF MISSING THE CUT HE HAS 
DONE WHAT HE HAD TO DO THAT IS 
WHAT GOLF IS PLAYERS CALL 
PENALTIES ON THEMSELVES IN NO 
OTHER SPORT IN THE WORLD DOES 
PLAYER CALLED PENALTY ON THEMSELVES SNOOKER 
EVERYONE IS THEMSELVES SNOOKER WATCHING THERE ARE CAMERAS ALL 
OVER WELL WELL WELL I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF 
SIMILARITIES BETWEEN SNOOKER ROUND 
GOLF SNOOKER AND GOLF SELECTION OF SHOT STRIKING THE 
BALL FIRMLY 
IT IS ALSO SOMETHING 
YOU CAN PRACTICE ON DIFFICULT TO MAKE THEM FROM THE FRINGE THIS GREEN LOOKS FLAT BUT IT IS 
TAILING OFF EIGHT FEET SHORT OF 
THE HOLE HAS QUITE AN ENIGMA IS MICHAEL CAMPBELL HE IS QUITE AN ENIGMA THE YELLOW SCHOOLS ON THE RIGHT 
SHOW YOU THE AMOUNT OF HOLES THE 
PLAYERS HAVE ACTUALLY COMPLETED 
THE YELLOW SCORERS TIGER HAS A LOT TO THINK ABOUT HERE IS THE OLD MASTER HIMSELF THE 
MAN IN WHITE 
IS THAT THE WHITE 
FLAG SURRENDER 
NO WE DO NOT 
THINK ABOUT THAT WITH THIS OLD BOY 
IF HE GOES IN THE BUNKER WE WILL 
LOSE HIM 
HE IS A GREAT OLD WALLS 
HE IS A GREAT CHAMPION NINE THOUSAND PRESS 
UPS A DAY AT LIVING ON A HANDFUL 
OF NUTS THAT WAS A HUGE DRIVE FROM BOKA TEE 
UP IN THE STAND FROM DOUGHERTY 
TRICKY ONE FROM THERE FOR MANY YEARS HE HAD THE 
REPUTATION OF BEING THE FINEST 
BUNKER PLAYER ALL TIME OF ALL 
TIME THAT WAS PHENOMENAL BECAUSE THAT 
BALL LOOKED LIKE IT HAD SETTLED 
DOWN AND WAS HALF BURIED HE STILL LOVES LIFE HERE IS ANOTHER ONE WHO LOVES LIFE HE HAS WON HERE A COUPLE OF TIMES THERE ARE CERTAIN SHOT AT AUGUSTA 
THAT YOU SEE ON TELEVISION ON 
LIFE SAID AND SHOTS THERE ARE 
CERTAIN SHOTS THAT YOU SEE ON 
TELEVISION ALL YOUR LIFE JUSTIN NEEDS TO COME IN A COUPLE 
UNDER PAR AT WORST IF HE CAN THAT 
SHOWS HOW UNLUCKY CAN BE JUST A 
FEW FEET SHORT THAT HAS LEFT HIM A 
HORRIBLE LITTLE PITCH IT IS THE BEST TO OPENING DAYS I 
HAVE SEEN AT AUGUSTA FOR QUITE SOME 
TIME TWO OPENING DAYS VERY 
LITTLE WIND L. HAVE NEVER SEEN SO 
MANY PEOPLE THEY HAVE FILLED THE 
GROUNDS COME ON GARY THE FREE DROP A TOLD THE GRANDSTAND FLIPS IT UP OUT OF THE BANDSTAND SEE HOW IT SPEEDS UP I WONDER WHAT HIS THOUGHTS ARE 
THIS IS HIS FIRST VISIT TO AUGUSTA 
HAND MIND BODY WILL TO FLIGHT 
THE BALL INTIMIDATING AND 
INSPIRING AUGUSTA THAT WAS CUTE WASN'T IT AND TIGER AT THE ELEVENTH HE HAS LEFT HIMSELF ANOTHER 
HORRIBLE PUTT 
ALMOST AS DIFFICULT 
AS THE ONE HE LEFT HIMSELF BACK AT 
THE TENTH GREAT SHOT THERE BY JEEV MILKHA SINGH IT IS 
A WONDERFUL SETTING BEHIND THE GREEN AT THE TWELFTH A SUPERB ARRAY OF FLOWERS THAT WAS A NEAT SHORT THE ELEVENTH IS A VERY CHALLENGING HOLE 
SURVEYED IT FOR US 
THE ELEVENTH IS FIVE HUNDRED FIVE 
YARDS THE LONGEST PAR FOUR AT THE 
AUGUSTA 
NATIONAL AND 
WITHOUT DOUBT 
THE MOST DIFFICULT THE TEE SHOT 
REQUIRES A LITTLE FEED THERE CAN 
DRIVE DOWN 
THE RIGHT 
THE SECOND 
SHOT YOU'RE 
PLAYING THE 
FULL LENGTH 
OF 
LEFT 
AS THE 
WATER 
AND TO 
THE BACK 
RIGHT A HORRIBLE DEEP BUNKER 
THIS 
GREEN SLOPES 
FROM BACK 
TO 
FRONT LEFT THERE 
IS A BIG TILT 
ON IT OF COURSE TO DO THAT YOU 
HAVE GOT TO 
TAKE THAT 
WATER IT IS SO EASY 
TO THINK 
I DO 
NOT WANT 
TO OVERDRAW IT AND GO INTO 
THE WATER YOU THEN LEAK 
OUT TO 
LEFT HAND 
SIDE AND 
ARE 
DOWN TOWARDS 
THE 
WATER IT 
IS A 
VERY 
TOUGH SHOT 
YOU NEED 
QUITE 
VELVETY TOUCH TO GET IT CLOSE BUT 
WE HAVE SEEN MANY PLAYERS IN THE 
PAST 
TO HAVE 
HAD THE ANSWER 
TO IT 
THERE 
WAS NO 
DECISION L. HAD 
PLAY AN AGGRESSIVE CHIP 
SHOT OF 
THE 
GREEN AND 
AS IT 
STARTED 
GETTING TEN 
FEET FROM 
THE HOLE I HAD 
TO THINK 
WHAT IS 
IT GOING TO
