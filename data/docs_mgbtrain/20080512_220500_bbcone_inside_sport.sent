FLAVIO'S FOOTBALL FORMULA 
BRITAIN'S BOXING BROTHERS AND THE 
DEAN MACHINE IS THERE REALLY ROOM 
FOR ALL OF THAT TONIGHT ON INSIDE 
SPORT 
WELCOME TO INSIDE SPORT AN ACTION 
PACKED PROGRAMME RANGING FROM 
FOOTBALL TO FISHING THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE HAD ITS USUAL SHARE OF 
LAUGHTER AND TEARS AS IT DREW TO A 
CLIMAX YESTERDAY BUT FOR 
RELEGATION DEFYING FULHAM AND BOSS 
ROY HODGSON THE SCRIPT COULD HAVE 
BEEN WRITTEN IN AUGUST 
YOU DO NOT 
HAVE TO BE AN INCREDIBLE EXPERT TO 
WORKOUT THAT PROBABLY THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP WOULD GO TO ONE OF 
THESE FOUR 
WILL FORMULA ONE BOSS 
FLAVIO BRIATORE BE ABLE TO MAKE 
QUEENS PARK RANGERS A GLAMOUR CLUB 
AGAIN 
WE WANT TO BE IN THE PLAY AGAIN OFFS IN THREE YEARS 
ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST FISH IN THE OLYMPIC 
DECATHLON PAUL IS DEAN MACEY WHEN WHEN I AM INJURED I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A 
LOTTERY TICKET WITH ALL SIX NUMBERS 
AND I CANNOT CASH IT IN L. FEEL 
LIKE I HAVE ENOUGH TALENT TO WIN 
THE OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL I FEEL I 
SHOULD HAVE WON IT IN TWO THOUSAND BRITAIN BRITAIN WILL SEND ITS BAND OF BOXING 
BROTHERS TO BEIJING THIS SUMMER WE WE ARE ALL LIKE SCALLY IS GOING TO 
BEIJING WE GO OUT AND HAVE A DRINK 
AND HAVE A LAUGH WE ARE JUST 
NORMAL LADS 
WITH ME TONIGHT STEVE BUNCE OF THE 
INDEPENDENT AND OUR HEAVY WEIGHT 
TONY LIVESEY WHO ALSO PACKS MEAN 
PUNCH THE TWO THOUSAND AND IT PREMIER 
LEAGUE SWITCH TO HALT YESTERDAY 
WITH MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS 
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BUT IT IS HARD TO I. D. THAT THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE WAS PREDICTABLE 
TO ARGUE 
FULHAM'S ROY HODGSON HAS A GLOBE 
TROTTING C. V. INCLUDING STINTS 
COACHING THE SWISS AND FINNISH 
NATIONAL SIDES AS WELL AS CLUBS 
SUCH AS BLACKBURN ROVERS AND INTER 
MILAN HE HAS HAD HIS WORK CUT OUT 
IN HIS QUEST TO KEEP FULHAM IN THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE SINCE HE TOOK UP THE 
CHALLENGE IN THE NEW YEAR ROY ROY HODGSON HAS BEEN A COACH FOR THIRTY TWO 
YEARS AROUND THE WORLD BUT I DO 
NOT THINK HE HAS EVER SEEN A FINAL 
DAY QUITE LIKE THIS 
IT WAS A VERY 
TENSE OCCASION THE NINETY MINUTES L. L. 
DO NOT THINK YOU PROGRAMME WILL BE 
LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO DESCRIBE ALL 
THE EMOTIONS I WAS FEELING DURING 
THE NINETY MINUTES L. WAS REASONABLY 
CALM IN THE SENSE THAT I THOUGHT 
THE TEAM WAS PLAYING WELL AND WE 
WERE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER 
AS A COACH SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO 
BE SATISFIED WITH THAT WE ALL 
DREAM OF WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO 
HAPPEN 
AT HALF TIME ROY HODGSON'S HAPPEN FULHAM ARE STARING AT RELEGATION 
AT HALF TIME IT WAS MOST IMPORTANT 
FOR US TO INSIST ON KEEPING THE 
SAME TEAM SHAPE KEEPING THE 
SOLIDITY OF OUR PERFORMANCE BECAUSE 
WE WERE FAIRLY SOLID IN THE FIRST 
HALF AND TO KEEP MAKING SURE WE 
BELIEVED IN OUR POSSIBILITIES AND 
NOT TO THROW CAUTION TO THE WIND 
ON THE BASIS THAT TECHNICALLY WE 
WERE RELEGATED DUE TO THE OTHER 
RESULTS HA 
FULHAM TAKE THE LEAD 
IT IS A GAME 
AND IF THE TEAM IS DOING ITS BEST 
AND PLAYING AS THEY WANT TO PLAY 
YOU JUST HAVE TO HOPE THAT SOMEONE 
LIKE DANNY MURPHY COMES UP WITH 
FANTASTIC HEADER 
DANNY MURPHY HAS 
SCORED THE GOAL THAT KEEPS ROY 
HODGSON IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE WE WE HAD A MEDICAL RECORDS NOT WINNING 
AWAY FROM HOME FOR TWO YEARS NO 
BACK TO BACK WINS LAMENTABLE 
RECORDS TO DO THAT WITH THE 
PRESSURE THE PLAYERS WERE UNDER 
KNOWING THAT EACH GAME WE WENT INTO 
WERE WE TO LOSE OR DRAW WOULD BE 
THE END OF US I THINK IT WAS A 
FANTASTIC ACHIEVEMENT IT WAS 
DIFFICULT TO SLEEP LAST NIGHT 
BECAUSE THE TENSION OF THE GAME IT 
STAYS WITH YOU THE ADRENALIN IS 
STILL PUMPING AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE 
MORNING YOU WISH YOU WERE SLEEPING 
INSTEAD FROM THE PROGRAMMES I WAS 
WATCHING LAST NIGHT THE TEXT WAS 
COMING ROUND QUITE OFTEN FULHAM 
COULD QUALIFY FOR A PLACE IT 
SURPRISES ME BECAUSE ONE OF THE 
FIRST JOBS I HAD WHEN I CAME TO THE 
CLUB WAS TO A TEN A HEARING AT THE 
F. A. AND ANSWER TO OUR POOR 
DISCIPLINE RECORD ATTEND A 
HEARING IT SURPRISES ME THAT WE 
HAVE LEAPT FROM BEING THE WORST TO 
ONE OF THE BEST IT CONCERNS ME A 
BIT IT IS WONDERFUL TO PLAY UEFA 
FOOTBALL BUT THESE FAIR PLAY GAMES 
YOU HAVE TO COME IN VERY EARLY IN 
THE COMPETITION IT MIGHT BE A 
POISONED CHALICE IF WE GET IT I 
WILL SEE HOW HAPPY THE CLUB BAR IF 
THEY ARE HAPPY I WILL BE HAPPY 
THE INTENSITY AND PRESSURE OF THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE MAKES IT ARGUABLY 
ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT LEEDS IF 
NOT THE MOST DIFFICULT LEAD TO PLAY 
IN LEAKS 
THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN A MOMENT WHEN 
THERE WAS A BIT MORE POSSIBILITY 
FOR MORE THAN THE TOP FOUR TO BREAK 
IN AND GIVE THEMSELVES A CHANCE OF 
WINNING THE CHAMPIONSHIP BUT FOR 
THE LAST TEN YEARS I DO NOT THINK 
IT HAS EVER BEEN MUCH DIFFERENT AT 
THE START OF THE SEASON YOU DO NOT 
HAVE TO BE AN INCREDIBLE EXPECT TO 
WORKOUT THAT PROBABLY THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP WILL GO TO ONE OF 
THESE FOUR PROBABLY FIVE SIX OR 
SEVEN WILL BE INVOLVED IN 
RELEGATION THE MONEY GETS BIGGER 
EVERY YEAR THE PRESSURE ON THE 
MANAGERS AND COACHES AND PLAYERS 
GET BIGGER EVERYTHING COMES BACK 
IN THE END TO MONEY THE CHAIRMAN 
IS LIKE THE BEST OF US A VERY 
UNHAPPY TO HAVE HAD THE TYPE OF 
SEASON WE HAVE HAD L. AM SURE HE 
WOULD LIKE A MUCH MORE SOLID BASE 
AND A BIT LESS TENSION IN TERMS OF 
TRYING TO MAINTAIN OUR PREMIERSHIP 
STATUS WE KNOW THAT TO BE BETTER 
PLACED TEAM WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE 
SQUAD WHAT SORT OF MONEY WILL BE 
MADE AVAILABLE FOR ME TO ACHIEVE 
THAT I DO NOT KNOW AT THE MOMENT 
THE CHAIRMAN HAS PUT A LOT OF MONEY 
IN THIS YEAR THAT IS FOR SURE HE 
MIGHT BE CONCERNED IF I SAID YOU 
HAVE TO SPEND ENORMOUS SUMS OF 
MONEY AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 
NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED AT BOARD 
LEVEL AND WITH THE CHAIRMAN WE 
KNOW THAT HE WANTS THE BEST 
IT IS 
THE BUSINESS STUFF THAT MANAGERS 
GET UP TO RIGHT NOW 
CONGRATULATIONS TO ROY HODGSON 
GIVEN THE DIABOLICAL START HE HAD 
A WHAT WE HAD YESTERDAY WAS SOME OF 
THE MOST FICKLE FORTY FIVE MINUTES OF 
FOOTBALL WE HAVE HAD STEVE COPPELL 
IS PROBABLY GOING TO LEAVE READING 
AND ROY IS THE LATEST GENIUS THE 
IRONY IS THAT NONE OF THE BOTTOM 
THREE WOULD HAVE HAD HIM AT THE 
TIME HE WENT TO FULHAM THE ONLY 
DIFFICULTY HE HAS NEXT SEASON IS IF 
HE GETS ONLY THREE POINTS FROM THE 
FIRST EIGHT GAMES HOW LONG WILL HE 
LAST CHELSEA SPENT SIXTY MILLION ON 
A RIGHT BACK WHERE D. C. HAS SEVEN 
MILLION FOR THE WHOLE SUMMER IT IS 
NOT GOOD WHEREAS HE HAS ONLY SEVEN 
MILLION 
IT IS 
THE BUSINESS END OF MILLION THE SEASON 
WE THOUGHT FULHAM WERE 
RELEGATED THEY WERE IN A SERIOUS 
FOOTBALL COMA BUT THEN THEY WERE 
BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE DANNY MURPHY 
IS FAMOUS FOR SCHOOL RUN WITH HIS 
HEAD IT IS THE BUSINESS END ONE 
OR TWO PEOPLE COULD BE ON THEIR WAY 
OUT OR UNDER SIEGE WE TEND TO LOOK 
AT THE END OF THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE 
THROUGH ROSE TINTED GLASSES AND 
IMAGINE EVERYONE PLAYS AND GOES OFF 
TO THE BAHAMAS IT DOES NOT HAPPEN 
THAT WAY RYE WAS NOT AT THE 
COTTAGE TODAY TO DO THE INTERVIEW 
HE WAS THERE TO WORK ROY HODGSON 
I DOUBT THERE ARE MANY MANAGERS NOT 
BACK IN THEIR OFFICE APART FROM 
SOME OF THEM WHO IS PROBABLY NOT 
AT LOCKED OUT 
LEAGUE NEXT YEAR 
KNOW 
WHO'S GOING 
TO GET 
IT IS SPLIT INTO FOUR IT IS QUITE 
DEMARCATED WE 
HERE I 
JUST 
SAY WE 
HAVE JUST 
GOT TO BEAT THE TEAMS 
AROUND US WE HEAR MANAGERS SAY 
A AS IT MAKE IT ANY LESS EXCITING 
KNOWING THAT 
YOU HAVE GOT TO WIN 
YOU DON'T 
LIKE IT 
IS AS SIMPLE AS 
THAT YOUR OWN LEAGUE 
THE TOP OF 
THE TABLE WAS FANTASTIC ARSENAL 
DOMINATED FOR SO LONG CHELSEA WERE 
NEVER ONCE AT THE TOP OF THE 
PREMIER LEAGUE AND YET WERE ONLY 
POOLE OR TWO GOALS AWAY FROM 
WINNING IT 
IT IS A THREE HORSE 
RACE IF YOU SPLIT IT DOWN TO 
DIFFERENT GROUPS WEST BROM COULD 
GO INTO THE HANGERS ON SECTION NEXT 
SEASON 
IN SCOTLAND THE LEAGUE HAS SEASON BEEN EXTENDED THANKS TO RANGERS 
SUCCESS ON ALL FRONTS YOU HAVE 
BUMPED INTO A FEW FANS ON THE WAY

MANCHESTER UNITED 
AND 
LIVERPOOL ALL 
I NEEDED TO IMPROVE 
STADIUMS TO 
GET MORE 
STADIUMS TO GET MORE PLAYERS PEOPLE 
INTO THE 
GROUND L. THINK

WITH AN 
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND 
CAPACITY STADIUM IN THE PREMIERSHIP 
THERE IS PERCEPTION OF YOU AS 
PLAYBOY HAVE 
PEOPLE GOT 
PLAYBOY HAVE PEOPLE GOT YOU'RE WRONG 
I DO

ROCK TO 
BUILD FROM I 
WOULD LIKE 
TO 
ROCK TO BUILD FROM I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THERE ARE SO MANY CLUBS 
IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP WITH 
FIVE YEAR 
PLANS 
IN FIVE 
YEARS' TIME 
IT IS 
GOING TO BE HELL 
IT STARTED BY 
ACCIDENT A LAST MINUTE REPLACEMENT 
WHEN A TEAM MATE FELL ILL AND A SIXTEEN 
YEAR OLD FROM CANVEY ISLAND BROKE 
THEIR RECORDS FOR THE OCTATHLON AT 
SIXTEEN DEAN MACEY WAS THEIR WORLD 
RUNNER UP AND HE HAS FOUND TIME 
ALSO TO BECOME AN ELITE ANGLER 
HAS 
NOT ONLY 
BUT OURS AS WELL WHEN 
ON A MEDAL 
AT THE LAST TWO OLYMPICS 
I WENT TO 
MEET HIM FOR 
NOT 
ON THE 
TRACK 
NOT ON THE TRACK BUT 
IF I GIVE YOU A DEMONSTRATION YOU 
CAN DO IT GOSH GO IT IS THERE L. 
LOST SIGHT OF IT L. HAVE THE TWO 
BEST HOBBIES IN THE WORLD IF I AM 
HEALTHY I TRAIN AND I LOVE IT AND 
IF I AM INJURED I FISH AND I LOVE 
THAT LAST WEEK THERE WAS OUT FOR 
THIRTY SIX HOURS YOU STAY OVERNIGHT 
COOKED CURED DINNER RUN THE BANK 
WHEN BOTH HANDS ARE FULL YOU HAVE 
DINNER I TAKE MY FISHING VERY 
SERIOUSLY I LOVE THE RELAXING SIDE 
OF THINGS MY ROD TIP IS JUST 
BANGING AROUND NOW IT HAS STOPPED 
IT MADE ME LOOK LIKE A FOOL IS IS THAT A FISH 
YES WE MIGHT GET ONE 
SEA I TOLD YOU TO TRUST ME THAT 
LITTLE NOISE MEANS THAT SOMETHING 
IS INTERESTED IN DEBATE WHEN I 
RING UP MY WIFE AND I HAVE COURTED 
BIG FISH WHEN I HAVE CAUGHT A 
SEVEN POUND JOB SHE SAYS WELL 
DONE WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR DINNER 
WE DO THROWBACK A SEVEN POUND FISH 
I WOULD GIVE IT A BIG FISH AND THEN 
NO SIT IN THE WATER UNTIL IT WAS 
READY ADMITTED SWIM OFF NURSE IT 
I LIKE THE HUNTING ELEMENT I HAVE 
NO INTENTION OF KILLING ANY FISH 
THAT I CATCH L. GIVE IT SOME 
ANTISEPTIC CREAM AND WHITE PIT 
HONESTLY LIKE IT 
IT IS SUCH A PHENOMENALLY TOUGH 
EVENT PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE WHAT 
YOUR TRAINING INVOLVES 
I DO TWO 
CIRCUIT SESSIONS THREE WEIGHT 
SESSIONS AND AS MANY TECHNICAL 
SESSIONS AS POSSIBLE IN THE WEEK 
THE RUNNING SESSIONS ARE THE 
HARDEST BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE 
PHYSICALLY UP FOR IT AND MENTALLY 
PREPARED BUT I REALLY ENJOY THEM 
HOW MUCH PAIN L. USED IT DURING SESSIONS 
YES YOU READ THE SKIN OF SESSIONS YOUR THROW BECAUSE YOU ARE BEING 
SIX SO MUCH YOU RIP THE SKIN IN IN TRAINING THIS WILL BE NEXT WEEK 
YOU WILL BE DOING THIS HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY YES I WAKE UP ONE MORNING AND SAY 
YESTERDAY WAS GOOD LET'S GET ONE 
STEP CLOSER TO GOLD LET'S MAKE 
EVERY DAY COUNT IN THE NEXT SEVEN 
WEEKS I HAVE TO GO THROUGH BLOOD 
SWEAT AND TEARS AND HOPE EVERYTHING 
HOLDS UP 
STEVE CRAM SAID THAT IN 
THE END THE INJURIES GOT IN 
INSOMUCH AND HE HAD TO RETIRE HE 
SAID HOW MUCH SHE ADMIRED THE WAY 
YOU COPED WITH YOUR INJURIES HE 
ADMIRED 
I DO NOT COPE VERY WELL AT ADMIRED ALL PEOPLE HAVE THE MISCONCEPTION 
I GET INJURED A REASONABLE AMOUNT 
BECAUSE I AM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE THAN 
OTHER PEOPLE EVERYONE HAS TO TRAIN 
HARD I HAVE REACHED POINTS WHEN I 
HOPE AND WISH SOMEONE WOULD SAY 
HERE IS THERE TOO GRAND A YEAR 
COME AND WORK FOR ME BUT LUCKILY 
THAT GUY NEVER TURNED UP ON MY DOOR 
SO YOU LIKE TO A JOB 
YES BUT ONE 
MAN INJURED I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A 
LOTTERY TICKET WITH ALL SIX NUMBERS 
BUT I CANNOT CASH IT IN WHEN I 
AM INJURED L. FEEL I SHOULD HAVE 
WON THE OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL IN TWO THOUSAND 
NOT SO MUCH IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR BECAUSE OF 
CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES I DID NOT 
IT IS HEARTBREAKING TO KNOW THAT 
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THE PEOPLE THAT 
BEATTIE BUT NOT BE ABLE TO SHOW 
EVERYONE ANYONE CAN SAY I AM 
BETTER THAN SOMEONE ELSE BUT IT IS 
ABOUT PROVING IT ON THE DAY DEAN DEAN MACEY WELL AND TRULY CROWNED THE 
COMMONWEALTH CHAMPION 
FOUR YEARS 
AGO I WAS CLOSE TO RETIRING AND 
NOW I AM CHAMPION OF THE 
COMMONWEALTH IT FEELS TEN TIMES 
BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING 
TO BE 
WHEN HE FINALLY HAD THE GOLD 
MEDAL IN YOUR HANDS AT THE 
COMMONWEALTH GAMES DID YOU FEEL 
THIS IS WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE 
THROWING UP THE PAIN AND 
SACRIFICE WHEN YOU FINALLY HAD 
YES I WOULD HAVE DONE IT TENFOLD 
ON THAT DAY I WAS THE BEST MAN 
COMPETING ON THAT DAY IT FELT 
PRETTY MUCH HOW I WOULD HAVE 
IMAGINED IT WHEN I WENT BACK TO 
THE COMMONWEALTH VILLAGE I SAT IN 
MY ROOM ON MY OWN MY LEGS WERE 
HANGING OFF I COULD BARELY LIFT MY 
ARMS TO SCRATCH MY HEAD L. PATTED 
MYSELF ON THE BACK AND SAID GOOD 
JOB DEAN 
WITH SO MUCH IN THE WAY OF DRUG 
SCANDALS LET'S CALL THEM THE 
DECATHLON IS SEPARATE BUT THE OTHER 
REFERENCE THE SPORTSMAN OF THIS 
COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD TO 
HAVE BEEN TAINTED ACCUSED AND 
PROVEN TO BE DRUGS CHEATS HOW DOES 
THAT MAKE YOU FEEL BECAUSE YOU ARE 
PART OF THAT SPORT 
TO BE PERFECTLY 
HONEST IT IS NOT MY JOB TO WORRY 
ABOUT THEM IF I WORRY ABOUT 
EVERYONE ELSE I AM COMPETING 
AGAINST BEING ON THE DEER AND STUFF 
LIKE THAT I AM NOT DOING MY JOB 
ON THE DEER 
IT IS COMPLETELY ILLEGAL AND 
IMMORAL BUT APART FROM THAT I 
WOULD NEVER WANT TO TAKE MY FAMILY 
NAME AND HAVE MY PARENTS WALKED 
DOWN THE ROAD AND SAY YOUR SON IS 
A CHEAT L. COULD NEVER LIVE WITH 
THAT MYSELF 
WHAT ABOUT THE 
POLITICAL STORIES WE HAVE SEEN THE 
TORCH RELAY IN LONDON AHEAD OF 
BEIJING AND THERE WILL BE MORE IS 
IT FAIR THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE CALL 
FOR ATHLETES TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR THAT 
I DO 
NOT THINK SO L. DO NOT KNOW THE INS AND OUTS L. L. STAY 
AWAY FROM THE POLITICAL SIDE OF 
THINGS BUT IT IS MY JOB TO LOOK 
AFTER MY FAMILY L. AM AN ATHLETE BY 
TRADE SO IF THE OLYMPICS ARE IN 
BEIJING I WILL GO THERE TO TRY AND 
WIN A MEDAL TO LOOK AFTER MY FAMILY 
AS MUCH AS THAT SOUNDS HORRIFIC AND 
DEAN IS THOUGHT LESS I'M NOT IN A 
POSITION AS AN INDIVIDUAL TO MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE 
DOES IT NOT MAKE YOU DIFFERENCE ANGRY THAT ATHLETES ARE EXPECTED TO 
BE THE ONES THAT BEAR THE BRUNT I I DO NOT KNOW L. SPEND SO LITTLE TIME 
THINKING ABOUT IT THAT I DO NOT ONE HUNDRED 
PER CENT UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TALKING 
ABOUT 
GENERALLY ATHLETES AT THE ABOUT MOMENT THEY ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT 
IT 
I DO NOT REALLY TRAINED WITH IT ATHLETES BUT I HAVE NEVER HEARD IT 
MENTIONED I DO NOT REALLY 
TRAINED YOU HAVE NOT 
TICKETS SPONSOR NO 
LEE DO NOT NO HAVE A ENDORSEMENTS OR MAKE MONEY 
GOING ROUND THE CIRCUIT RACING 
YOU DO NOT YOU GET MONEY FROM THE 
LOTTERY 
I SPEND TEN A WEEK ON THE LOTTERY LOTTERY SIR I AM SELF FUNDED L. 
HAVE WON NOTHING IN THE LAST TEN 
YEARS BUT I AM COOL L. HAVE GOT 
EVERYTHING I NEED L. HAVE TIME TO 
FISH AND SPEND WITH MY FAMILY I 
GET ALL THE TRAINING DONE I NEED TO 
DO I JUST NEED NOT TO GET INJURED 
AND MAYBE I WILL WIN A MEDAL DO DO YOU EVER WISH YOU HAD CHOSEN A 
DIFFERENT EVENT 
NOT NOW THAT I 
HAVE DONE IT IF SOMEONE COULD 
LITERALLY JUST BLESS ME WITH TALENT 
TO BE THE FASTEST MAN ON EARTH OR 
TO BE THE GREATEST FOOTBALLER ON 
EARTH OR THE GREATEST OF ANYTHING 
ON EARTH HAND ON HEART I WOULD 
CHOOSE TO BE THE GREATEST 
DECATHLETE THAT EVER LIVED BECAUSE 
IT IS THE HISTORY BEHIND THE EVENT 
IT IS BEING THE GREATEST ALL ROUND 
ATHLETE EVEN THOUGH WE ARE THE 
POOREST ARE TOLD ALL THE ATHLETES 
WE COMMAND MORE RESPECT THAN ANYONE 
ELSE 
KING OF THE JUNGLE ELSE THEY ARE ELSE NOT GOING TO GET A BITE NOW 
DEAN MACEY A GUY THAT ANYBODY 
WOULD WANT TO SPEND AN HOUR IN HIS 
COMPANY YOU COME AWAY FEELING 
INVIGORATED AND ANY CYNICISM YOU 
MAY HAVE ABOUT DRUGS WE FOLLOWED 
DWAIN CHAMBERS AND WE HAVE BEEN 
CYNICAL ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS 
ABOUT ATHLETICS AND HE JUST BLOWS 
THAT AWAY 
WE USED THE EXPRESSION 
HE IS AN OLD FASHIONED STYLE 
FIGHTER OR FOOTBALLER HE IS AN 
OLD FASHIONED STAR ATHLETE L. BET 
YOU WAS FIBBING A BIT THERE BECAUSE 
I BET HE ALSO WISHES HE WAS A WORLD 
CLASS SHOT PUT A RAW JAVELIN 
THROWER THAT WAY HE COULD COMPETE 
IN THE GRAND PRIX HIS PROBLEM IS 
HE CAN ONLY COMPETE IN BIG EVENTS 
THAT IS WHY HE IS LOW PROFILE HE 
SHOULD BE A LOT HIGHER 
IT SHOULD 
BE HIGHER FOR THE SAKE OF KIDS WHO 
WANT TO GET INTO THE SPORT BECAUSE 
THIS MAN IS LIVING LIKE AN AMATEUR 
WITHOUT THE TRAPPINGS OF SUCCESS 
THIS GUY TAKES ICE BATHS IN 
DUSTBIN IN HIS BACK GARDEN HE 
WOULD NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MONEY 
IF HE GOT A MEDAL IN BEIJING 
BECAUSE THERE IS A MOVIE IN THERE 
WE HAVE JUST SEEN SOMEBODY WAS 
READY TO INVEST BILLIONS IN QPR 
WHY WILL SOMEBODY NOT TAKE UP AND 
ON HE BREAKS DOWN BEFORE HE COMPETES 
AT GOTHENBURG AND 
THEN HE 
DOES NOT 
GO TO 
A SACKER IF 
YOU DO NOT 
COMPETE IN 
THE BIG 
EVENTS YOU JUST DO NOT COMPETE WE WE WISH HIM ALL THE 
VERY BEST IN 
QUALIFYING FOR 
BEIJING AND 
THEN AT 
BEIJING WHEN HE 
GETS THERE LAST

A 
GOOD CHAT 
ABOUT BOXING IT IS GOOD 
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN GREAT BRITAIN 
WENT AWAY TO INTERNATIONAL 
TOURNAMENTS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE THREAT 
THAT HAS 
CHANGED IN THE 
LAST FIVE YEARS 
YES NOW WE GO TO 
TOURNAMENTS 
AT OTHER

DO NOT 
WANT TO GET DRAWN 
AGAINST US WHEREAS A FEW YEARS AGO 
ENGLAND WERE 
IN EASY 
DRAW NOW

BOXING IN 
THE FINAL IT

DISAPPOINTMENT WHERE ONE

CRYSTAL PALACE 
AND THEN 
ONLY SIX 
OR SEVEN 
MONTHS OF THE YEAR NOW 
THEY MIGHT SPEND FOUR DAYS AND FOUR 
NIGHTS A 
YEAR AT THE 
INSTITUTE 
OF SPORT AND 
THAT HAS 
BEEN GOING 
ON 
FOR ABOUT 
A YEAR 
THE ENTIRE TEAM 
OF EIGHT WILL 
BE

THE 
WINNER 
SEVENTY 
OF THE 
ONE HUNDRED DAYS 
LEADING UP

OLYMPICS THAT IS 
WHY

I WILL GET THE 
GOLD 
BOXING IS A UNIQUE OLYMPIC GOLD SPORT 
IT IS 
THE ONLY SPORT 
IN THE 
SUMMER OR WINTER GAMES WHERE 
WINNING THE GOLD 
MEDAL 
IS NOT THE 
HIGHEST AND 
GREATEST THING YOU CAN 
HIGHEST AND GREATEST THING YOU CAN DO SURE IT IS HARD IT IS 
INCREDIBLY 
DIFFICULT AND 
A 
FANTASTIC ACHIEVEMENT 
FOR ANY 
ATHLETE TO WIN 
AN OLYMPIC GOLD 
MEDAL BUT UNLIKE OTHER ONCE 
A BOXER 
WINS 
A GOLD 
MEDAL HE 
HAS GOT SOMEWHERE 
ELSE TO 
GO 
HAS CAUGHT THE 
PROFESSIONAL GAME 
I 
HAS CAUGHT THE PROFESSIONAL GAME I AM FIGHTING 
FOR MY 
FUTURE 
AND MY 
FAMILY'S FUTURE 
NOT JUST 
TO MAKE 
MY COUNTRY AND FAMILY PRUDE BUT 
BECAUSE OF 
THE FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF 
THINGS I WILL 
HAVE THE 
NATION 
BEHIND ME AND 
I WANT 
TO WIN 
A GOLD MEDAL 
FOR MY 
COUNTRY AND 
MAKE EVERYONE PRUDE NOT ONLY THAT 
TO INSPIRE YOUNG UP AND COMING 
BOXERS THAT THEY COULD DO SOMETHING

AN INTERESTING POINT 
THAT THE MEDAL 
IS 
NOT THE 
BE ALL AND END ALL IN 
BOXING AN 
OLYMPIC PURIST MIGHT 
HAVE A QUIBBLE ABOUT 
THAT BUT
