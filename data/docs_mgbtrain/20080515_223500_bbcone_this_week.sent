ISN'T EASY L. L. SHOULD KNOW IF 
YOU'RE GOING TO PUT YOURSELF OUT 
THERE YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE WRAP 
THAT GOES FOR POLITICS TOO 
NICE TO SEE YOU TO SEE YOU 
NICE THAT WAS RUBBISH COMPLETE 
RUBBISH YOU KNOW THAT GROTING IS 
ALMOST AS FAMOUS AS EVENING ALL 
WELCOME TO THIS WEEK ALMOST BUT 
L'M 
SURE YOU'LL AGROW NOT QUITE WE 
HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE BECAUSE 
THINGS HAVE NEVER BEEN BUSIER HERE 
AT THE PALACE OF VARIETIES WHERE 
THE GREAT LEADER HAS BECOME 
PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINE OUT OF 
THE KINDNESS OF HIS HEART AND WHO 
SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE ONE HE'S GIVEN 
US A SURPRISE GIVAWAY BUDGET NOT 
ONE BUT TWO QUEEN'S SPEECHES HOW'S 
THAT FOR GENEROSITY IT'S 
IMPOSSIBLE TO BE IN T. V. OR RADIO 
STUDIO THESE DAYS WITHOUT BUMPING 
INTO THE GREAT LEADER WHICH ONLY 
PROVES WHAT MAN OF THE PEOPLE HE 
IS THE AIRWAVES HAVE BEEN THICK 
WITH RELAUNCHES POLICY INITIATIVES 
RECYCLED STATEMENTS AND DEAD CAT 
BOUNCES THE USUAL CARPING CRITICS 
CLAIM ALL THIS ACTIVITY WAS 
DESIGNED TO CROWD OUT WHAT THE DIRE 
WARNINGS OF MERV THE KING OF THE 
BANK OF ENGLAND WHO HAS DECIDED 
THE GOOD TIMES ARE OVER ACTUALLY 
I THINK WE'VE WORKED THAT OUT 
OURSELVES WHY BE DEPRESSED WHEN 
THE GREAT LEADER IN IN HIS COUNTING 
HOUSE COUNTING ALL OUR MONEY AND 
THE LEGENDARY BRUCE FORSYTH TURNED 
UP AT PMQ'S HE'S GOING TO GRACE US 
ALL WITH HIS PRESENCE ON THIS VERY 
SHOW TONIGHT NOW I AM ESPECIALLY 
EXCITED BECAUSE EVERY TIME BRUCIE'S 
ON T. V. HE HAS TWO LOVELY ASSISTANTS 
WITH HIM SADLY THEY COULDN'T MAKE 
IT TONIGHT INSTEAD WE'VE GOT 
DIANNE ABBOT AND MICHAEL PORTILLO 
IT'S ALL OUR BUDGET WOULD STRETCH 
TO DIANNE YOUR MOMENT OF THE WEEK 
ALISTAIR DARLING ANNOUNCED HIS 
PACKAGE RECOMPENSE FOR THE TEN P. TAX 
RATE FRANK FIELD APOLL GYLESED FOR 
HAVING ABUSED GORDON BROWN OVER THE 
WEEKEND IT WAS QUITE GRACEFUL 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE CHERIE BLAIR 
APOLOGISING FOR THE SAME ANY TIME 
SOON 
WASN'T IT LIKE THE STALINIST SOON SHOW TRIALS WHEN YOU APOLOGISE TO 
THE GREAT LEADER AFTER SAYING HE 
WAS BARKING MAD WHEN I SAID 
BARKING MAD I DIDN'T MEAN BARKING 
IT WAS A NICE THING TO DO 
SHE'S IN 
GENEROUS MOOD TONIGHT MICHAEL WHAT 
WAS YOUR MOMENT 
IT APPEARED IN THE 
PAPERS THERE'S AN IDEA AROUND FOR A 
B. B. C. SHOW IN WHICH YOUNG HOPEFULS 
WILL BE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY 
WOULD MAKE GOOD PRIME MINISTERS 
AND THE IDEA HAS BEEN PUT UP TO THE 
PRIME MINISTER THAT HE SHOULD BE 
THE JUDGE OF THIS SHOW THAT HE 
SHOULD BECOME A CELEBRITY 
LIKE THE 
APPRENTICE 
INDEED IN THE BLUSH APPRENTICE BLURB THEY'VE OFFERED THE PRIME 
MINISTER THE PROSPECT THAT HE COULD 
BE MORE POPULAR THAN SIR ALAN SUGAR 
APPARENTLY IT'S BEING CONSIDERED 
DOESN'T THE APPRENTICE WORK BECAUSE 
SIR ALAN SUGAR IS VERY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN 
I THINK YOU PUT YOUR BUSINESSMAN FINGER ON SOMETHING THERE 
I OFTEN 
PUT MY FING ORN A FEW THINGS OUR 
GREAT LEADER SAYS HE FEELS OUR PAIN 
I FEEL HIS DAVID CAMERON SAYS HE 
DOESN'T MIND BEING CALLED DAVE 
THOUGH WHEN I CALLED HIM DAVID ETON 
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER HE TOASTED MY 
BUM I FELT THAT PAIN TOO HOW MUCH 
DO WE REALLY KNOW ABOUT OUR 
POLITICAL LEADERS MAYBE IT'S 
BETTER IN AMERICA IN THE NEVER 
ENDING RACE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC 
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION HILLARY 
CLINTON AND BARACK OBAMA HAVE MET 
HUGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THEY 
HAVEN'T BEEN SHY GOING HEAD TO HEAD 
ON T. V. DEBATES AGAIN AND AGAIN SO 
ARE WE MISSING A TRICK HERE IN THE 
WAY WE DO POLITICS WHO BETTER TO 
ASK THAN THE KING OF SHOWBIZ BRUCE 
FORSYTH HIMSELF THE GREAT MAN'S 
BACK FROM ACROSS THE POND WHERE 
HE'S BEEN WATCHING THE RACE TO BE 
THE NEXT PRESIDENT 
FIFTY YEARS IN PRIME TIME TELEVISION 
IN ALL THAT TIME TELEVISION HAS 
CHANGE SOD MUCH LIKE ALL 
BUSINESSES CHANGED SO MUCH LIKE 
ALL BUSINESSES I'VE NEVER BEEN 
POLITICALLY MINDED ONLY IN THE 
LAST TEN OR TWELVE YEARS THAT I'VE 
BECOME INTERESTED SO I SUPPOSE 
POLITICS MUST HAVE CHANGED OVER THE 
YEARS THE SAME WAY EVERYTHING ELSE 
HAS AND I FEEL THAT NOW ADAYS 
TELEVISION THAT IT IS TRIAL BY 
TELEVISION A POLITICAL LEADER 
PARTICULARLY HAS TO LOOK GOOD ON 
TELEVISION HAS TO ALWAYS HAVE 
COMMAND OF EVERYTHING HE'S SAYING 
ALMOST LIKE BEING AN ACTOR L. 
WOULDN'T SAY THEY ARE ACTORS BUT I 
THINK MAYBE AT TIMELES THEY HAVE TO 
DO A BIT OF ACTING BUT YOU'RE 
THERE ON SHOW THE LAST FEW MONTHS 
I'VE BEEN IN PUERTO RICO WE GET 
ALL THE AMERICAN TELEVISION FROM 
THERE I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO SEE 
THE PRIMARIES IN AMERICA I'VE 
NEVER SEEN ANY OF THAT BEFORE L. 
WAS MOST IMPRESSED A LEADER THERE 
HAS TO REALLY GO OUT TO THE PEOPLE 
TO EVERY STATE FROM HERE THERE 
EVERYWHERE THE DEBATES THEY HAVE 
ARE VERY VERY INTERESTING WHERE 
THEY'RE ALL CONFRONTING ONE ANOTHER 
IT'S A WONDERFUL SYSTEM IN SOME 
WAYS I THINK IT WOULD MAKE OUR 
POLITICS HERE EVEN MORE EXCITING L. 
REALLY DO WHEN THEY HAVE TO FACE 
ONE ANOTHER THE DEBATES I THINK 
THEY'D BE SO INTERESTING IN THIS 
COUNTRY YOU GET THE THREE THEY'VE 
DONE IT A LITTLE BIT EVEN WITH THE 
MAYOR WITH BORIS AND KEN AND THE 
OTHER GUY BRIAN WAS IT YEAH BRIAN 
I FOUND THAT VERY INTERESTING YOU 
SEE DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES 
COMPETING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IT'S 
ALMOST LIKE A QUIZ SHOW I SUPPOSE 
IT DOES WORK FOR ME IT WORKS 
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THAT YOU SAY 
TO YOURSELF YEAH I THINK HE WAS 
BETTER THAN HIM OR YES I THINK 
THEY WERE BOTH AS GOOD AS ONE 
ANOTHER IT MAKES YOU MAKE UP YOUR 
MIND THAT'S WHAT POLITICS IS ALL 
ABOUT MAKING UP YOUR MIND 
BRUCE FORSYTH FROM HIS HOME IN 
LONDON HERE HE IS IN OUR LITTLE 
HOME IN WESTMINSTER WHAT A 
PRIVILEGE 
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE PRIVILEGE THE CONVEYOR BELT ON YOUR 
MARVELLOUS SHOW YOU STARTED THE 
SHOW OFF YOU'VE LOWERED THE TONE 
ALREADY 
THERE'S NO DEPTHS TO WHICH ALREADY WE WILL STOOP 
I THOUGHT THIS SHOW 
HAD A BIT OF CLASS THEN A CONVEYOR 
BELT ON 
YOU WERE AT PRIME 
MINISTER'S QUESTIONS YESTERDAY YOU 
WERE SITTING ON THE FLOOR OF THE 
HOUSE NOT IN THE GALLERY THAT'S 
HOW PRIVILEGED YOU ARE THAT IN A 
WAY IS OUR THEATRE OF POLITICS 
WHAT DUE MAKE OF IT 
IT'S LIKE OLD 
FASHIONED MUSICAL WITH ALL THE 
BARRACKING AND EVERYTHING L. HAVE 
FACED MANY HOSTILE AUDIENCES 
ESPECIALLY IN GLASGOW 
I DID VERY 
WELL IN GLASGOW BY THE WAY L. WAS 
SUPPOSED TO DO TEN MINUTES AND I 
DID FIFTEEN THAT'S A RECORD WHEN YOU 
THINK THEY FACE THIS HOSTILE CROWD 
WHATEVER SIDE OF THE HOUSE YOU'RE 
ON WITH ALL THE HECKLING GOING ON 
AND BELIEVE ME SOME OF THE THINGS 
THEY SAY WE DON'T HEAR THIS ON 
TELEVISION 
UNLESS YOU'RE THERE TELEVISION DID YOU ENJOY IT 
I LOVED IT L. 
ONLY WENT THERE TO HELP MY DAUGHTER 
PROMOTE THIS THING VETS GET 
SCANNING FOR ALL THE TERRIBLE DOG 
CRIME THEN THEY SAID WOULD YOU 
LIKE TO GO TO AND I'VE NEVER BEEN 
SO IT WAS A WONDERFUL THING THAT THAT BIT WE GET RIGHT YOU THINK 
OH YES 
AMERICANS DON'T HAVE THAT 
NO NO 
THEY DO SHOW IT A LOT AT TIMES AND 
THEY HAVE A LAUGH AT IT BUT IT'S 
VERY GOOD TO HAVE PEOPLE BEING ABLE 
TO GET UP THAT'S WHEN YOU SEE WHO 
ARE THE PEOPLE THAT CAN REALLY PUT 
A POINT ACROSS L. MEAN YOU GET SOME 
OF THEM THEY'RE REALLY NO GOOD AT 
IT 
DON'T TALK ABOUT NICK CLEGG IT LIKE THAT 
DON'T BE LIKE THAT 
SHE'S GETTING PARTY POLITICAL IF IF YOU LOWER THE TONE I'M GOING TO 
TEACH YOU THE TANGO IF YOU WANT 
SOMEBODY TO HAVE A GO AT WE'VE GOT 
ROOM HERE 
SHE'S NERVOUS NOW I'VE 
HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT HOW MANY SHOW 
BUSINESS HAS CHANGED IN YOUR 
LIFETIME PARTICULARLY WITH THE 
INFLUENCE OF TELEVISION FROM THE 
VAUDEVILLE TO WHAT WE NOW HAVE HAS 
POLITICS CHANGED ENOUGH FOR THE 
MODERN WORLD 
I THINK IT HAS AND IT 
IS I THINK NOW THE YOUNGER PEOPLE 
LIKE IN AMERICA THIS TIME THAT 
WAS SO REMARKABLE I'D NEVER SEEN A 
PRIMARY IN AMERICA 
IT HAS ENGAGED 
YOUNG PEOPLE THIS TIME ESPECIALLY ESPECIALLY WITH OBAMA HE'S GETTING A YOUNGER 
CROWD OF PEOPLE FROM THE FORTIES DOWN 
THE OTHER PEOPLE UP ABOVE THEY'VE 
BEEN THERE FOR A WHILE BUT BELIEVE 
ME HE IS CATERING AND THE YOUNG 
PEOPLE DO LIKE HIM 
DIANNE HOW 
MUCH ARE GORDON BROWN'S PROBLEMS 
DONE TO JUST THE WAY HE COMES OVER 
ON MODERN MEDIA 
THAT IS AN ISSUE 
I THINK IT'S A MARGINAL ISSUE THE 
STATE OF THE WORLD ECONOMY IS MORE 
FUNDAMENTAL TO GORDON'S PROBLEMS 
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE POLICY ISSUES 
BUT MODERN POLITICS IS ALSO ABOUT 
PERSONALITY I THINK I GET THE 
SENSE LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T FEEL 
THE PRIME MINISTER'S PERSONALITY 
EITHER COMES OVER OR WHAT THEY SEE 
OF HIS PERSONALITY THEY DON'T LIKE 
THEY THINK THAT L. WOULDN'T WANT TO 
OVERSTATE THAT WHAT I WOULD LIKE 
TO SAY IS HOW THRILLED I AM TO BE 
ON WITH BRUCE FORSYTH L. WANT TO 
SAY THAT FOR ME I WILL ALWAYS 
REMEMBER SUNDAY NIGHT AT THE LONDON 
PALLADIUM 
THIS IS NOT THE BRUCE PALLADIUM FORSYTH FAN CLUB DO YOU WANT TO GO 
ROUND IN A CIRCLE NOW THIS IS A 
POLITICAL DISCUSSION SHOW I'M MOVE 
TO MICHAEL PORTILLO GO FOR THE 
SERIOUS ONE IN THE GROUP DON'T 
ENCOURAGE HER IN A SENSE GORDON 
BROWN DOESN'T GET OR DOESN'T COME 
ACROSS WELL ON THE MODERN MEDIA 
YOU ASKED A DWO BRUCE YOU SAY HOW 
MUCH HAS POLITICS CHANGED IT'S 
ALMOST CHANGED TOO MUCH ONE OF THE 
THINGS THAT PEOPLE HATE NOW IS SPIN 
ONE OF THE THING THEY VALELY VALUE 
IS HONESTY ONE OF THE PRIME 
MINISTER'S PROBLEM IS NOT THAT HE 
CAN'T HANDLE THE MEDIA BUT HE HAS 
A REAL PROBLEM WITH HONESTY TAKE 
TODAY AS AN EXAMPLE IT'S CLEAR 
THAT THEY HAD A NEW BUDGET THIS 
WEEK IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THE TEN P. 
PROBLEM INSTEAD OF SAYING I 
BROUGHT IN THESE MEASURES BECAUSE I 
HAD A REBELLION ON THE BACKBENCHES 
I MADE A MISTAKE HE SAID I THOUGHT 
IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO GIVE A BOOST 
TO THE ECONOMY AT THIS TIME AS THE 
AMERICANS DID ANYBODY CAN SEE 
THAT'S NOT HONEST WHEN HE CALLED 
OFF THE ELECTION INSTEAD OF SAYING 
I CALLED IT OFF BECAUSE I WASN'T 
GOING TO WIN IT HE SAID I WOULD 
HAVE CALLED OFF THE ELECTION EVEN 
IF I HAD BEEN ONE HUNDRED SEATS AHEAD IN 
THE POLLS PEOPLE CAN SEE THROUGH 
IT 
DO YOU THINK HONESTY IS MORE IT IMPORTANT THAN PERSONALITY IN 
TODAY'S MEDIA WORLD PERSONALITY IS 
WHATEVER YOUR POLICIES AND THEY'RE 
MORE IMPORTANT PERSONALITY IS 
IMPORTANT 
EXACTLY THERE AGAIN IN IMPORTANT AMERICA YOU KNOW YOU HAD I THINK 
FIVE OR SIX DELEGATES GOING FOR THE 
NOMINATION FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
CANDIDATES 
CANDIDATES SORRY ANY CANDIDATES WAY I DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT IT 
DON'T WORRY I'LL KEEP YOU RIGHT 
I'M VERY SCARED OF YOU ON THAT 
POLITICS SHOW YOU REAL LE GO INTO 
PEOPLE 
HE CAN BE VERY NASTY BRUCE PEOPLE DON'T START ALL THAT WITH ME YES YES LEAVE BRUCE ALONE 
NEVER ADD LIB 
WITH JULIUS 
HE WAS MY MUM'S 
FAVOURITE 
I'VE FORGOTTEN THE FAVOURITE QUESTION 
YOU GET THESE FIVE CANDIDATES AND 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE WEAKEST LINK 
WITHOUT A. N. N. ROBINSON AND THEY FIRE 
THESE QUESTIONS THAT'S GOOD YOU 
SEE PEOPLE'S PERSONALITY COME 
THROUGH HOW DID THEY DEAL WITH 
THAT QUESTION THIS IS WHY WHEN A 
PRESIDENT IS ELECTED IN AMERICA 
THEY'RE ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE AND AND THEY'VE BEEN TESTED 
BEEN TESTED 
AND THEY GO TO EVERY STATE AND I 
THINK IT'S ONE WONDERFUL THE MAN 
WHO COMES THROUGH 
OR WOMAN OR OR WOMAN EXACTLY 
NOW SHE'S 
CORRECTING YOU THEY'RE A TOUGH 
CROWD IN THIS PLACE 
THE DEMOCRATS 
WILL CHOOSE THE MOST CHARISMATIC 
CANDIDATE AND THE REPUBLICANS WILL 
CHOOSE THE LEAST 
I DON'T THINK 
IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT JOHN MCCAIN 
LACKS CHARISMA IT'S A DIFFERENT 
KIND OF CHARISMA HE'S QUITE 
ELDERLY 
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY ELDERLY NOW OTHERWISE IT WILL HAVE TO BE 
SHE'S ATTACKED YOU TWICE IN THE 
LONDON AND BRUCE MENTIONED THE 
LONDON MAYORAL ELECTIONS THESE 
WERE KIND OF PRESIDENTIAL WEREN'T 
THEY AND THEY GOT BIG TURNOUT BY 
LONDON STANDARDS 
YES IT WAS 
ALMOST IN SOME PARTS LIKE A GENERAL 
ELECTION TURNOUT WHICH IS VERY GOOD 
I HAVE TO SAY I WOULDN'T GET 
CARRIED AWAY WITH THE PERSONALITY 
ASPECT OF IT LINTON CROSS BY THE 
AUSTRALIAN ONE OF THE THINGS HE 
DID THAT WASN'T GLAMOROUS HE GOT 
TORY VOTERS OUT FOUR TIMES THE 
TURNOUT ORGANISED AS KARL ROVE 
DID FOR PRESIDENT BUSH TOO DO YOU 
THINK WE WILL MOVE IN SOME WAY DO DO YOU THINK WE'LL MOVE SOME WAY TO 
PRESIDENTIAL STYLE DEBATE IT'S A 
QUESTION BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG 
WHILE AND NEVER YET HAPPENED AT A 
GENERAL ELECTION 
THE PREPBL CAN 
NEVER SEE ANY REASON WHY HE SHOULD 
AGREE OR SHE SHOULD AGREE THE 
PRIME MINISTER THINKS THAT HE OR 
SHE HOLDS MOST OF THE WARDS AND 
SIMPLY GIVES CREDIBILITY TO THE 
OTHER CANDIDATE IF THE PRIME 
MINISTER ENGAGES THE OTHER 
CANDIDATE ON ABEQUAL FOOTING IN IN OPPOSITION TONY BLAIR WAS WAS ALL 
FOR DEBATE WHEN WE BECAME PRIME 
MINISTER HE WASN'T INTERESTED IF 
YOU'RE OPPOSITION YOU CALL FOR 
DEBATE EXACTLY 
IF WE HAD DEBATE DEBATE EXACTLY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A VERY 
DISPUTATIOUS HOUSE OF COMMONS THE 
BEST OF OUR POLITICIANS DO KNOW HOW 
TO DEBATE AT LEAST AS GOOD AS THE 
AMERICANS 
OH YES BUT BETTER L. L. AMERICANS BETTER I KNOW PEOPLE DON'T LIKE GEORGE 
GALLOWAY BUT HE WENT UP THE HILL 
TO CONGRESS AND SWEPT THE FLOOR 
TORE THEM APART 
BECAUSE HE'S A 
BRITISH PARLIAMENTARIAN THE THE STRENGTH COMES THROUGH TELEVISION 
WE ALL KNOW TELEVISION SOME PEOPLE 
JUST STOP GET THROUGH THE SCENE TO THE PEOPLE 
YOU'RE YOUNG MAN SO WHAT ABOUT 
YOUR POLITICAL AMBITIONS 
NONE AT 
THE MOMENT 
THAT'S A VERY POLITICAL 
ANSWER YOU KNOW 
I'VE BEEN 
PRACTISING I KNEW THAT WAS COMING 
WE'LL TAKE THAT AS A MAYBE THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING ON 
I'M A 
FAN OF THE SHOW L. WATCH IT EVERY 
WEEK IN FACT I'M SKY PLUSING IT AT 
THE MOMENT THERE'S A PAUSE 
LOVELY TOLL SEE YOU 
I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO TOP BRUCIE 
BUT DON'T GO TO BED OPEN CHAMPAGNE 
OR BUCKFAST IT'S THE FAVOURITE 
DRINK OF MANCHESTER FOUND OUT TO 
ITS COST LAST NIGHT BECAUSE LATER 
ON WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT 
DIGNITY THAT'S OBVIOUSLY 
SOMETHING I KNOW A LOT ABOUT AND 
COMEDIAN LEST DENNIS L. EZ DENNIS 
HE KNOWS THING OR TWO ABOUT DIGNITY AND INDIGNITY 
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF HAD YOU A 
REALLY REALLY CLOSE FRIEND YOU 
KNOW SORT OF MATE THAT YOU ALWAYS 
LIKE TO MEET FOR LUNCH SOMEONE 
WITH WHOM YOU COULD ALWAYS SHARE A 
BOTTLE OF BLUE NUN WHICH WOULD MAKE 
THEM EXTRA SPECIAL A FAVOURITE 
TENNIS PARTNER PERHAPS SOMEONE 
YOU REALLY REALLY LIKE SO MUCH IN 
FACT YOU'D MAKE THEM ONE HUNDRED MILLION 
YOU'D HELP WIN THEM THREE ELECTION 
TURN THEM INTO FAMOUS WORLD 
LEADER IMAGINE BEING A MATE LIKE 
THAT AND THEY THEN TURN THEIR BACK 
ON YOU IMAGINE YOU'D ALMOST FEEL 
SO UNLOVED YOU'D BE COMPELLED TO 
WRITE A BOOK ABOUT IT ANYWAY I 
DIE RES HERE'S LORD LEVY WITH HIS 
ROUND UP OF THE WEEK 
THIS IS WHERE I STARTED TO PLAY 
TENNIS WITH TONY BLAIR MANY YEARS 
AGO THEY WERE GREAT DAYS THIS 
THOSE DAYS THE SUN WAS SUNSHINE 
DOWN ON THE LABOUR PARTY SADLY 
THINGS AREN'T GOING TOO WELL FOR 
LABOUR TODAY I'M CERTAINLY A 
LABOUR MAN THROUGH AND THROUGH AND 
ALWAYS WILL BE BUT LOOK AT WHAT'S 
HAPPENED THINGS ARE GETTING REALLY 
TOUGH AND I CERTAINLY LEARNT IN 
THOSE DAYS YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP THE 
BALL IN PLAY AND YOU'VE GOT TO WIN 
ALL THE POINTS WE'VE GOT THE CREWE 
BY ELECTION COMING UP NEXT WEEK 
SUDDENLY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION HAS COME OUT 
THE BUDGET IN ORDER TO COPE WITH 
THOSE WHO'VE SUFFERED BECAUSE THE 
TEN P. TAX RATE HAS BEEN ABOLISHED 
YOU KNOW WHAT L. DON'T EVEN THINK 
ROGER FEDERER COULD HAVE PUT A 
BETTER SPIN ON IT THAN THAT 
THIS IS ONE OFF CHANGE ONLY FOR 
THIS YEAR ONLY HE SERVES UP 
COMPENSATION CON AFTER A TAX CON 
AND EXPECTS PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IT 
WHAT UTTER CYNICISM WHAT TOTAL 
INCOMPETENCE AND WHAT COMPLETE 
HUMILIATION FOR THIS CHANCELLOR OF 
THE EXCHEQUER 
THIS IS THE PARTY THAT WHEN THE 
PROPOSAL WAS FIRST MADE THEY WERE 
IN FAVOUR OF WITHDRAWING THE TEN P. 
RATE LAST YEAR WHEN MY RIGHT 
HONOURABLE FRIEND PUT FORWARD HIS 
AMENDMENT THEY ABSTAINED THEE 
WEEKS AGO THEY WANTED TO REINSTATE 
THE TEN P. RATE THEIR POSITION HAS 
BEEN COMPLETELY CONFUSED AND IT'S 
SELF EVIDENT TODAY THEY'VE NO IDEA 
WHETHER THEY'RE FOR OR AGAINST WHAT 
WE'RE PROPOSING 
WHILE FRANK FIELD 
THE LABOUR BACKBENCHER TOOK A REAL 
SMASH AT GORDON THIS WEEK SAYING HE 
WOULDN'T LEAD THE LABOUR PARTY INTO 
THE NEXT ELECTION GOOD ON YOU 
FRANK AT LEAST YOU APOLOGISED WHEN 
THE COMPENSATION PACKAGE CAME INTO 
PLAY 
AS THE PRIME MINISTER IS IN PLAY HIS PLACE MIGHT I ALSO ADD THAT 
OVER THE WEEKEND I ALLOWED MY 
CAMPAIGN TO BECOME PERSONAL L. MUCH 
REGRET THAT AND I APOLOGISE 
WITHOUT RESERVATION 
O. K. WELL THAT WAS ONE GOOD POINT 
FOR GORDON THIS WEEK NOW SO MUCH 
PERSONAL KINDNESS HAS COME OUT THIS 
WEEK ABOUT GORDON JOHN PRESCOTT 
SAID HE'S AN INCREDIBLE SULK I'D 
MADE COMMENTS ABOUT HOW MOODY AND 
BAD TEMPERED 
BE BUT GORDON 
IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE HE REALLY 
ISN'T 
WHILE GORDON HAS NOW REVEALED HIS 
GAME PLAN AND HE'S GIVEN REVIEW 
OF EIGHTEEN BILLS FOR THE QUEEN'S SPEECH 
GORDON ARE YOU GOING TO BE THE MAN 
TO LEAD THE COUNTRY AND TO LEAD US 
THROUGH THIS ROCKY ECONOMIC 
CLIMATE 
SO MR. SPEAKER A BANKING CLIMATE BILL TO SUPPORT FINANCIAL STABILITY 
AN EDUCATION BILL TO ENSURE EVERY 
SCHOOL IS A GOOD SCHOOL AN N. H. S. 
BILL TO ENSURE THE HEALTH SERVICE 
TO ENTRENCH PATIENTS' RIGHTS AN 
IMMIGRATION BILL SO PEOPLE EARN 
THEIR CITIZENSHIP A WELFARE REFORM 
BILL REFORMS ON AGENCY WORKERS ON 
SCALES AND ON FLEXIBLE WORKING 
THESE ARE THE PRIORITIES AND I 
COMMEND THIS STATEMENT TO THE HOUSE 
THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF THINGS 
IN THIS STATEMENT THAT WE WELCOME 
NOT LEAST BECAUSE WE PROPOSE THEM 
WE WELCOME THE CONSTITUTION FOR THE 
N. H. S. THAT'S AN IDEA WE SET OUT 
LAST JUNE WE WELCOME THE EXTENSION 
OF THE RIGHT TO FLEXIBLE WORKING 
WE ANNOUNCED THAT IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIX 
I HOPE WHEN HE GETS UP WE'LL GET A 
BIT OF GRATITUDE FROM THE PRIME 
MINISTER FOR ALL OF IT HE CAN'T 
REALLY SAY WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY 
SUBSTANCE WHEN HE'S TAKEN IT ALL 
AND PUT IT IN HIS QUEEN'S SPEECH 
THE CONSERVATIVES WILL SAY ANYTHING 
TO GET ELECTED BUT NOW IT'S CLEAR 
THE PRIME MINISTER WILL TRY 
ANYTHING TO CLING TO POWER HE'S 
REALLY SCRAPED THE LEGISLATIVE 
BARREL TO SAVE HIMSELF THIS TIME 
THIS LONG LEGISLATIVE LIST IS A 
RAG BAG OF PROPOSALS HE'S EITHER 
ADDRESSING THINGS ABOUT THE 
GOVERNMENT SAID WEREN'T A PROBLEM 
LIKE THE ECONOMY OR TRYING TO 
TURN AROUND PROBLEMS THE GOVERNMENT 
ITSELF CREATED LIKE OVER 
CENTRALISATION 
YOU CAN'T BLAME ALL CENTRALISATION OF THE PROBLEMS NOW THAT WE'RE 
FACING ON GORDON AND THE GOVERNMENT 
THERE'S A WORLD ECONOMIC CRISIS 
AND MERVYN KING HAS JUST SAID THAT 
AND THAT REALLY IS AFFECTING THIS 
COUNTRY LIKE MANY OTHERS VERY BADLY 
THE NICE DECADE IS BEHIND US THE 
CREDIT CYCLE HAS TURNED COMMODITY 
PRICES ARE RISING WE ARE 
TRAVELLING ALONG A BUMPY ROAD AS 
THE ECONOMY REBALANCES POLICY 
MONETARY CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT TRY 
TO PREVENT THAT AJUDGMENT THE 
MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MUST 
FOCUS ON BRINGING INFLATION BACK TO 
THE TWO PER CENT TARGET IN THE 
MEDIUM TERM 
WEEK IN CREWE THEN GORDON IT'S 
GOING TO GET TOUGHER FOR U. AND I 
HEAR THAT DAVID CAMERON WHO'S GOT A 
CUNNING PLAN UP HIS SLEEVE THIS THIS MORNING WE READ ABOUT A NEW PLAN 
FROM THIS GREAT MAN OF SUBSTANCE TO 
APPEAR ON A NEW VERSION OF THE 
APPRENTICE THE COMMUNITY SECRETARY 
I'M GLAD TO SEE ARE HERE BLUSHING 
SLIGHTLY IN HER PLACE SHE SAID 
I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP THIS IS 
THE APPRENTICE MEETS MAR RHEA 
MEETS STRICTLY COME DANCE BEING 
I'M SURE THERE'S A ROLE FOR THE 
LIBERALS I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA 
FOR THE PRIME MINISTER WHY NOT 
TAKE PART IN A REALITY SHOW THAT 
INVOLVES THE WHOLE OF THE COUNTRY 
IT'S CALLED A GENERAL ELECTION AND 
WOULDN'T IT GIVE EVERYONE THE 
CHANCE TO STAND UP IN FRONT OF THE 
PRIME MINISTER AND SAY YOU'RE 
FIRED 
STAN THAT WAS GREAT THANKS VERY 
MUCH O. K. WELL DAVID CAMERON AND 
THE TORIES THEY THINK IT'S GAME 
SET AND MATCH WELL DAVID THERE'S 
A LONG WAY TO GO YET AND GORDON 
GOOD LUCK YOU CAN STILL DO IT 
WELCOME TO THIS WEEK 
THANK YOU 
DIANE WHEN YOU HEARD THE 
CHANCELLOR MAKE HIS ANNOUNCEMENT ON 
THE TEN P. TAX BAND AND AND IT WAS 
GOING TO COST ALMOST THREE BILLION TO 
PUT IT RIGHT WAS IT GOING DID 
YOU FALL OFF YOUR CHAIR 
IT'S OUR 
HUMBER BRIDGE ACTUALLY HE THE 
LABOUR M. P.'S JUST WANTED PEOPLE THAT 
HAD LOST MONEY TO GET IT BACK BUT BUT SEVENTEEN MILLION OTHER PEOPLE GOT MONEY 
AS WELL THAT DIDN'T LOSE ANYTHING 
NO DOUBT GORDON IN HIS WISDOM AND 
HIS ADVISERS KNOW WHAT THEY'RE 
DOING 
TELL OUR AUDIENCE WHAT HAD DOING CHANGED BETWEEN THIS WEEK AND THE 
BUDGET A FEW WEEKS AGO 
A LOT OF 
LABOUR M. P.'S ARE WEGT THEMSELVES 
THAT'S WHAT CHANGED 
SOMETIMES YOU 
GIVE ME TOO MUCH INFORMATION 
MICHAEL WHERE IS THIS ON THE 
RICHTER SCALE OF U. TURNS WHICH 
I'VE JUST INVENTED WHERE IS IT I I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT ARE THE UNITS 
IS IT OUT OF TEN 
YES AND I THINK 
IT'S GEOMETIC 
THEN THIS IS A KIND 
OF SEVENTY EIGHT 
IT'S A BIG ONE IT'S PRETTY 
BIG I DON'T REMEMBER A U. TURN ON 
BUDGET QUITE AS BIG REMEMBER 
HAVING TO CHANGE THINGS LIKE PETROL 
TAX BUT TO CHANGE THE INCOME TAX 
PROVISIONS AT COST OF TWENTY SEVEN BILLION 
WITHIN SIX OR SEVEN WEEKS OF THE OF 
THE BUDGET IT'S PRETTY 
UNPRECEDENTED REALLY 
MICHAEL THE 
SCALE OF THE U. TURN AND THE AMOUNT 
OF MONEY THAT WE WEREN'T MEANT TO 
HAVE THAT'S BEING SPENT OR BORROWED 
OF COURSE DIDN'T THAT MAKE US 
REALISE WHAT A MESS HE WAS IN THE 
PRIME MINISTER HE WAS LOOKING AT 
THE END IF HE HAD LOST HIS FINANCE 
BILL IT COULD HAVE BEEN CURTAINS 
FOR HIM 
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND 
HOW IT HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE 
HOW CAN YOU REALLY GO AGAINST YOUR 
CORE VOTERS THE POPULOUS THAT 
VOTES AND SUPPORTS YOU THESE ARE 
YOUR LABOUR SUPPORTERS HOW CAN YOU 
TAKE AWAY THE TEN P. TAX RATE FROM 
THEM IT WAS SO DRAMATICALLY WRONG 
THATING DRAMATIC HAD TO BE DONE TO 
PUT IT RIGHT 
IT'S CALLED LOSING 
TOUCH THE MOMENT THAT THE 
CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER AS HE 
THEN WAS ANNOUNCED THE ABBIGGS OF 
THE TEN P. ABOLITION OF THE TEN P. RATE 
WAS WHEN HE ANNOUNCED THE REDUCTION 
OF INCOME TAX OF TWO P. IT DISHED OF 
THE TORBGS APPARENTLY FOR THOSE FIFTEEN 
BEING BE SECONDS OF GLORY HE DID 
SOMETHING WHICH IS REALLY DAMAGING 
TO HIS OWN SUPPORTERS 
THEY DID 
EXACTLY BECAUSE THEY WERE DESPERATE 
IT'S THE MIDDLE ENGLAND THING 
WHICH YOUR FRIEND TONY BLAIR WAS SO 
KEEN ON 
THAT'S WHY HE WON THREE 
ELECTIONS 
YOU ASKED FOR AN ELECTIONS EXPLANATION I'M GIVING YOU ONE 
WHICH IS HE THOUGHT HE HAD AUTUMN 
PENCILLED IN FOR AN 
HE 
WAS TERRIFIED THE TORIES WOULD GO 
IN WITH THE TWENTY P. BASIC RATE HE JUST 
THOUGHT HE WOULD GET AWAY WITH IT 
I TELL YOU WHY IT HAD SO MANY 
UNFORESEEN CONSEQUENCES THE ISSUE 
WAS NEVER PUT OUT TO PUBLIC DEBATE 
MANY TAX CHANGES ARE PUT OUT THE 
CHANCELLOR IS GOING THROUGH THIS 
WITH C. G. T. THIS WAS A RABBIT WHIPPED 
OUT THE HAT IN THE LAST SECONDS 
BUDGET MANY PEOPLE DID NOT REALISE 
HE WAS FINANCING THE TWO P. CUT WITH 
THE ABOLITION WHICH WAS 
EFFECTIVELY DOUBLING THE STARTING 
RATE IF THAT HAD GONE OUT TO 
DEBATE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE REALISEED 
THE REALISED THE THE CHILD 
POVERTY ACTION GROUP 
SOME OF HIS 
ADVISERS SAID THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT 
THING TO DO 
HOW DAMAGED IS GORDON BROWN BY 
THIS 
HE CAN SURVIVE THIS HE THIS REALLY K. THE REAL ISSUE IS WHAT 
HAPPENS TO THE ELECTION TO SAY IT 
WASN'T DEBATED FRANK FIELD MOVED 
AN MANAGEMENT 
I MEAN BEFORE IT WAS 
ANNOUNCED IN THE BUDGET THERE WAS 
NEVER A DISCUSSION YOU'RE GRINNING 
MICHAEL 
I WAS GRINNING BECAUSE I MICHAEL THOUGHT DIANNE'S ANSWER WAS 
SIGNIFICANT WHEN YOU SAID HOW 
DAMAGED IS HE HER ANSWER IS HE 
CAN SURVIVE 
OF COURSE HE CAN 
THIS IS THE FANTASY WORLD WE'VE 
MOVED INTO EIGHT MONTHS AGO HE 
BECAME THE PRIME MINISTER PEOPLE 
THOUGHT HE WAS STRONG HE INHERITED 
THIS GREAT POSITION HIS VIRTUE WAS 
HE WAS DIFFERENT FROM TONY BLAIR IN 
EVERY RESPECT NOW DIANNE SAYS HE 
CAN SURVIVE THAT'S THE LIMIT OF IT 
NOW 
THE FANTASY WORLD IS THE NOW SPECULATION AMONGST COMMENTATORS 
THAT THERE WILL BE A LEADERSHIP 
PUSH IT TAKES SEVENTY SIGNATURES THERE 
ARE NOT SEVENTY SIGNATURES TO REMOVE 
GORDON BROWN 
WHO IS THE PUSH GOING 
TO GO TO 
WE WANT TO GET RID OF 
GORDON BROWN BECAUSE HE'S WOODEN ON 
CAMERA WHO DO WE REPLACE HIM WITH 
DAVID MILIBAND 
WHY WOULD YOU WANT 
TO BE A NEW LEADER AT THE MOMENT 
IT'S A HOSPITAL PASS YOU'RE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WHERE SOMEONE 
THAT COULD BE AND WOULD BE THAT 
OUTSTANDING THAT COULD REALLY TAKE 
THEM OUT AS YOU CALL IT THE 
HOSPITAL INTO THE REAL FIGHT TO 
WIN I DON'T SEE SOMEONE IS THERE 
YOU'D BE SURPRISED AT THE PEOPLE 
WHO THINK THEY ARE THAT PERSON 
THAT'S A DIFFERENT POINT THAT'S THAT'S WHY THEY GO INTO POLITICS IN THE 
FIRST PLACE ISN'T IT 
I DON'T HAVE 
TO SAY ANYTHING REALLY 
NO DOUBT 
YOU WILL 
HERE'S DIANNE SAYING 
BROWN WILL SURVIVE BECAUSE IT'S SO 
DIFFICULT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION OF 
THE LABOUR PARTY TO GET RID OF HIM 
HE WILL SURVIVE NO NO THE THE SECOND POINT THERE'S NOBODY GOOD 
ENOUGH TO REPLACE HIM 
HE WILL 
SURVIVE BECAUSE A LOT OF THIS IS 
HYSTERIA A LOT OF LABOUR M. P.'S 
WEREN'T EVEN MEMBERS OF THE PARTY 
WHEN BLAIR BECAME LEADER WHO ARE 
NOT USED TO UNPOPULARITY 
WHAT I 
MEANT BY THE FATE OF THE PRIME 
MINISTER IS NOT THAT HE WILL BE 
CHALLENGED I'M ASSUMING HE STAYS 
UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TEN DECAPITATION IS IN THE 
IN YOUR PARTY'S D. N. A. UNLIKE THE 
TORIES AND THERE IS NOBODY RUSHING 
TO TAKE OVER L. MEANT THAT THE 
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS ELECTORATES 
CAN HAVE LONG MEMORIES BLACK 
WEDNESDAY FOR THE TORIES WAS 
SEPTEMBER NINETY SECOND THE ELECTORATE 
HADN'T FORGOTTEN BY NINETY SEVEN THIS IS 
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE ELECTION WILL BE TWO THOUSAND TEN 
THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE FORGOTTEN 
THAT'S THE RIGHT 
WE'LL SEE YOU YOU COULD BE RIGHT DAVID CAMERON AT 
THE MOMENT 
HE'S ON A ROLL 
IS ON 
A ROLL IS HE STILL REALLY THE 
RIGHT PERSON TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY 
I'M NOT CONVINCED OF THAT 
YOU'RE A 
LABOUR SUPPORTER 
I AM A LABOUR 
SUPPORTER YOU'RE RIGHT WHAT I'M 
SHOCK B. D. IS IN SPITE OF THE WHOLE 
BLAIR BROWN FIASCO OVER THE LAST 
NUMBER OF YEARS I TRULY THOUGHT 
GORDON WAS SOLID AND HAD AN 
UNDERSTANDING OF HIS PARTY AND 
POLITICS 
AND HIS 
BASE AND HIS POLITICS BASE AND WHAT HAS SURPRISED ME 
OVER THIS LAST PERIOD HOW THAT HAS 
SUDDENLY BEEN LOST THAT TO ME IS 
SOMETHING THE WHOLE ISSUE IS 
WHETHER HE CAN RECAPTURE IT AND 
WHETHER THE ELECTORATE BELIEVE THAT 
HE IS STILL THAT SOLID POLITICIAN 
THEY UNQUESTIONABLY THOUGHT HE WAS 
WHEN THEY TOOK HE TOOK OVER THE 
LEADERSHIP 
I'D LIKE TO BANK THAT LEADERSHIP QUOTE TO HERE IS A MAN WHO HAS 
RAISED MLDS OF POUNDS FOR THE 
LABOUR PARTY 
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE 
IT TENS OF MILLIONS ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THE WORST THING YOU CAN SAY 
ABOUT DAVID CAMERON WAS YOU WEREN'T 
CONVINCED HE WOULD BE THE BEST 
LEADER WE'LL BANK THAT ONE FIRST FIRST TEST OF WHAT MICHAEL LEAFY SAID 
WILL BE THE CREWE BY ELECTION IT'S 
HOPED IT WILL STOP THE ROT IN CREWE 
MY SENSE OF PEOPLE GOING THERE IS 
THAT IT MAY HAVE HELPED A LITTLE 
BIT BUT THE TORIES ARE FAVOURED TO 
WIN WHAT DO YOU HEAR 
THAT'S WHAT 
I HEAR BY ELECTIONS ARE 
UNPREDICTABLE 
IT WOULD BE BAD NEWS UNPREDICTABLE AFTER ALL THIS HE STILL LOSES CREWE 
IT WOULDN'T BE GOOD 
IS HE GOING TO 
LOSE CREWE 
WE THINK OUR VOTE IS 
HOLDING UP GORDON ISN'T HELPED YOU 
KNOW BY FORMER BLAIR COURTEERS BAD 
MOUTHING HIM 
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 
MICHAEL LEVY 
NO NO BUT HE'S NOT 
HELPED BY THE BAD MOUTHING THAT GEZ 
ON BEHIND THE SCENES 
LET ME COME 
ONTO THIS BANK OF ENGLAND INFLATION 
REPORT THAT HAS COME OUT IS A 
DEVASTATING ECONOMIC DOCUMENT WHICH 
WILL BE THE BACK DROP FOR OUR 
POLITICS OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR SO 
IT'S TALKING ABOUT INFLATION 
REACHING ALMOST FOUR PER CENT ON THE NARROW 
MEASURE BY THE END OF THIS YEAR AND 
STAYING THERE UNEMPLOYMENT RISING 
OF GROWTH SLOWING WAY DOWN MAYBE 
EVEN COUPLE OF QUARTERS OF NEGATIVE 
GROWTH FOR A MAN PRIME MINISTER 
WHO MADE HIS NAME ON THE ECONOMY 
THAT'S A TERRIBLE REPORT IT'S IT'S TERRIBLE INTERESTING TOO THAT 
MERVYN KING COMES OUT AND SAYS ALL 
THIS THE PRIME MINISTER IS NOT 
ABLE TO INFLUENCE WHAT HE SAYS HE 
SAYS IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT 
OVERSHADOWS THE SHADOW QUEEN'S 
SPEECH THE PRIME MINISTER CANNOT 
HAVE BEEN PLEASED L. DETECT A POWER 
PLAY HERE THE PRIME MINISTER 
LINGERED FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE HE 
DECIDED TO NOMINATE MERVYN KING FOR 
ANOTHER TERM MERVYN KING IS NOW 
ASSERTING WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER 
IS WEAK HE IS GETTING STRONGER 
THE PRIME MINISTER WHO MADE HIS 
NAME ON THE ECONOMY AS CHANCELLOR 
IS STILL SAYING JUDGE ME BY THE 
ECONOMY IF I WAS MR. BROWN AND READ 
THAT REPORT I MIGHT THINK TWICE 
ABOUT SAYING THAT NOW HE'S HE'S THINKING PROBABLY TWICE ABOUT 
SAYING THAT L. DID SAY IT IN THE 
SHORT PRESENTATION EARLIER WE ARE 
IN A WORLD RECESSION THAT WORLD 
RECESSION IS BOUNCING ONTO OUR 
ECONOMY NO MATTER HOW STRONG OUR 
ECONOMY IS WE ARE NOT IN AN 
ISOLATION WARD WE HAVE TO BE 
AFFECTED BY WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE 
WORLD RECESSION 
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY 
WILL GROW BY FOUR PER CENT THIS YEAR ACCORDING 
TO THE I. M. F. WE HAVE TO MOVE ON 
LORD LEVY THANKS FOR JOINING US 
GOOD TO BE HERE 
WE LIKE TO THINK 
WE'RE A DIGNIFIED BUNCH HERE THE 
OTHER DAY DIANNE TURNED DOWN 
ANOTHER OFFER TO SPILL THE BEANS IN 
HER TELL ALL MEMOIRS OF HER NIGHTS 
IN BALMORAL WITH PRINCE SORRY I 
PROMISED NOT TO SAY WE DON'T WASH 
OUR DIRTY LAUNDRY IN PUBLIC L. KNOW 
FOR A FACT MICHAEL SENDS OUT HIS TO 
A POSH OUTFIT IN KNIGHTSBRIDGE 
DIGNITY IS OUR MIDDLE NAME NOT 
EVERYONE IS SO DEMURE IN A WEEK 
WHEN CHERIE BLAIR TOLD US SHE WAS 
QUOTE TOO EMBARRASSED TO PACK HER 
CONTRACEPTIVE EQUIPMENT WHEN SHE 
WENT TO BALMORAL TOO MUCH 
INFORMATION CHERIE NO MORE THANK 
YOU WE FOUND OURSELVES WONDERING 
HOW LOW CAN YOU GO NOT MUCH LOWER 
SOME OF YOU SAY TONIGHT WE DECIDED 
TO PUT DIGNITY IN THE SPOTLIGHT 
WHAT PRICE DIGNITY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AS THE 
FORMER P. M.'S WIFE LOST HER BY 
PUBLISHING HER MEMOIRS 
WHEN I GET OLDER LOSING MY HAIR 
MACHINE MANY YEARS FROM NOW 
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO MAINTAINING A 
DIGNIFIED SILENCE DOES DIGNITY 
HAVE ANY CURRENCY NOW ADAYS OR IS 
IT WHAT'S SELLING OUT WORTH 
SELLING OUT FOR THE CASH WHEN YOU 
CAN CHERIE'S NOT ALONE JOHN 
PRESCOTT HAS BEEN GOING PUBLIC 
ABOUT HIS PRIVATE LIFE SOME 
POLITICIANS WILL DO ANYTHING TO 
LOOK HUMAN BUT IS IT DIGNIFIED 
WHO'S THE BEST KISSER 
IT CAN 
THOORD MAINTAIN DIGNITY IN DIVORCE 
AND IN DEFEAT AS RANGERS RAMPAGING 
FOOTBALL FANS REMINDED US ONLY LAST 
NIGHT SO TO WHOM SHOULD WE LOOK 
FOR GUIDANCE MAYBE WE COULD ALL 
LEARN A THING OR TWO FROM HER 
MAJESTY MAJESTY SOMETIMES LOSING YOUR DIGNITY CAN 
BE OUT OF YOUR HANDS AND ALL YOU 
CAN DO IS LAUGH IT OFF 
HAZEL BLEARS THERE LEZ DEN SIS 
WITH US WELCOME TO THE SHOW WHAT WHAT A SHOW TO BE HERE WITH BRUCE LORD 
LEVY I FEEL DAUNTED 
TELL ME THIS 
WHY IS DIGNITY IMPORTANT DO YOU 
THINK 
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THINK IT'S SOMETIMES VERY HARD TO HOLD 
ONTO I'VE BEEN ON BOTH SIDES I'VE 
HAD LACK OF DIGNITY AND HOPEFULLY 
MANAGED TO RECLAIM IT L. THINK IT'S 
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SUGGESTS 
HONESTY ACCEPTANCE AND ALSO TAKING 
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE THINGS THAT 
YOU GET WRONG IN LIFE AND SAYING 
HANDS UP WHICH IS WHAT FRANK FIELD 
DID THIS WEEK SO BRILLIANTLY YOU YOU MENTION FRANK FIELD AS YOU LOOK IN 
FROM THE OUTSIDE DO YOU THINK 
THERE IS MUCH DIGNITY IN POLITICS 
IS FRANK THE EXCEPTION THAT PROVES 
THE RULE 
IT IS A VERY RARE AND 
BRAVE THING FOR SOMEBODY TO STAND 
UP THERE AND DO WHAT HE DID L. 
THINK PROBABLY IT IS RARER THAN IT 
SHOULD BE RARER SOMETIMES IN 
POLITICS AND IN LIFE NOW ADAYS 
PEOPLE ARE LESS DIGNIFIED BECAUSE 
WE'RE CHASING AFTER THE DEAL AREN'T 
WE EVERYBODY'S CHASING 
IS IT MORE 
DIFFICULT THEN IN YOUR VIEW TO BE 
DIGNIFIED TODAY THAN IT MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN IN YEARS GONE BY 
I THINK 
WE'RE BECOMING A VERY SELFISH 
SOCIETY AND YES I THINK WE'RE NOT 
TAUGHT DIGNITY SO WELL NOW ADAYS 
DO YOU THINK THAT'S RIGHT DID WE 
HAVE MORE DIGNITY IN DAYS GONE BY 
THAN WE DO TODAY ARE WE LIVE 
ANYTHING AN UNDIGNIFIED AGE YES YES IN A WAY THERE'S LESS DEMAND FOR IT 
AS WELL ONE OF THE REASONS THERE'S 
LESS DIGNITY IS THAT PEOPLE ARE 
PREPARED TO PAY FOR INDIGNITY WHY 
DID CHERIE PUT THE DETAIL IN THE 
BOOK BECAUSE SOMEBODY SAYS WE'LL 
MAKE MORE MONEY YOU'LL MAKE MORE 
MONEY THE EFFECT OF INDIGNITY 
DEPENDS ON WHAT PEOPLE'S ORIGINAL 
OPINION OF SOMEONE IS IN THE CASE 
OF JOHN PRESCOTT INDIGNITY WAS USED 
AS A STICK TO BEAT HIM WITH IN THE 
CASE OF BORIS JOHNSON HIS 
INDIGNITIES HAVE ROUNDED OUT 
THEPERSONALITY AND LED TO POLITICAL 
SUCCESS I THINK IT'S ONE OF THESE 
THINGS 
DEPENDS ON THE PERSON 
YEAH 
WHY SHOULD WE EXPECT ORDINARY YEAH PEOPLE TO BE DIGNIFIED 
IT'S THE 
WAY WE WERE BROAD UP IT'S THE WAY 
WE SHOULD BE BROUGHT UP 
WHERE ARE 
THE EXAMPLES TODAY WHEN CHERIE 
BLAIR WRITES WHAT SHE DOES IN HER 
BOOK WHERE IS THE DIGNITY IN THAT 
AND WHAT MESSAGE WHAT EXAMPLE IS 
SHE SENDING OUT TO OTHER PEOPLE 
WELL AS YOU SAY TOO MUCH 
INFORMATION IN CHERIE'S BOOK YOU 
DO SEE DIGNITY REMEMBER SEEING 
THE MOTHERS OF SOME OF THESE YOUNG 
MEN THAT GET STABBED OR SHOT 
APPEARING OUTSIDE THE COURT THESE 
ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN IN 
FRONT OF CAMERA 
ONE HUGE EXAMPLE 
THIS WEEK AMAZING TREMENDOUS AMAZING TREMENDOUS DIGNITY 
AND A COMPASSION THAT I DIGNITY DON'T KNOW WHETHER IN THAT 
SITUATION I WOULD BE ABLE TO SHOW 
THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE PAPARAZZI 
WITH THE KIND OF PAPARAZZI YOU 
DIDN'T HAVE TWENTY YEARS AGO WHO GO 
FOR UNDIGNIFIED SHOTS WITH THE 
CULTURE OF REALITY TELL VISION AS 
ERM MICHAEL 
AS MICHAEL SAID ERM MICHAEL SHE'S THINKING ABOUT BRUCE AND THE 
TANGO 
SHE GETS TIRED ARE THERE TANGO DIFFERENT STANDARDS OF DIGNITY IN 
SHOW BUSINESS COMPARED TO POLITICS 
IN A SENSE SHOW BUSINESS IS ROUGH 
AND TUMBLE BUT ALSO VERY DIGNIFIED 
ACTORS 
ABSOLUTELY VERY DIGNIFIED ACTORS ACTORS AND VERY DIGNIFIED 
PERFORMERS AND AS YOU SAY THE 
PAPARAZZI ARE EVERYWHERE NOW THERE 
IS A LOT OF YOU GET A LOT OF 
CELEBRITIES MOANING AND CHINGEING 
ABOUT BEING FOLLOWED BUT IT'S WHAT 
WE PUT OUR SFRLZ OUT THERE FOR IF 
YOU PUT YOUR HEAD ABOVE THE PARAPET 
YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT FOR A 
WHILE I MOANED ABOUT THE PRESS 
IT'S ONLY WITH HINDSIGHT AND 
LOOKING BACK CERTAINLY BY WRITING 
MY OWN BOK AND HELPFULLY BEING 
HONEST AND TRYING TO BE DIGNIFIED 
WHEN YOU'RE BEING HONEST AND YOU'RE 
MAYBE TELLING THINGS ABOUT THAT 
HAVE HAPPENED IN YOUR LIFE YOU'RE 
HOPING YOU'RE NOT HURTING OTHER 
PEOPLE BY DOING THAT YOU FACE THAT 
CHANCE OF BEING SEEN AS UNDIGNIFIED 
DID THAT BRING YOU BACK FROM 
FEELING INDIGNITY TO BEHAVING IN A 
DIGNIFIED WAY IT CAN BE DONE I I HOPE SO 
MICHAEL YOU'RE AN EXAMPLE 
OF THAT TOO THAT TERRIBLE ELECTION 
NIGHT FOR YOU IN NINETY SEVEN YOU WERE SEEN 
TO BE DIGNIFIED IN DEFEAT FOR MANY 
PEOPLE THAT WAS THE START OF A 
CHANGED PERCEPTION FOR YOU 
YES IN 
A WAY I WOULD SAY WELL THANK YOU 
ANY WAY L. WOULD SAY TO LEZ BECAUSE 
HE SAID WHAT FRANK FIELD DID WAS 
BRAVE IN A WAY I WOULD SAY THE 
OPPOSITE N. A WAY TO DOT DIGNIFIED 
THING IS SOMETIMES THE SIMPLE THING 
MAYBE NOT TO HAVE DONE WHAT HE DID 
IN THE FIRST PLACE 
WHEN I LOST MY 
SEAT I SAW DAVID MELLOR IN A SCRAP 
WITH JIMMY GOLDSMITH AT HIS RESULT 
JUST BEFORE MINE L. THOUGHT IT'S 
GOT TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THAT L. 
HAD AN EXAMPLE TO WORK OFF 
NOT TO 
BE I'M AFRAID DIANNE SINCE YOU 
CAN'T REMEMBER MY NAME EITHER THE 
BOOK IS CALLED
