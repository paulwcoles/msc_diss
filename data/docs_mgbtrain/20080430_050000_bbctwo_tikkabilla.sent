DOES ANYONE IN YOUR FAMILY PLAY A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT 
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED 
OH THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE WINDOWS 
MAYBE WE'LL FIND OUT ABOUT ANOTHER MUSICAL INSTRUMENT THROUGH THEM 
HOW MANY WINDOWS 
ONE TWO THREE 
ROUND SQUARE OR ARCHED 
WHICH ONE WILL IT BE 
IT'S THE ROUND WINDOW 
BARRY HAS DRILLED A HOLE THROUGH A BLOCK OF WOOD 
TO MAKE A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT 
BUT WHAT INSTRUMENT WILL IT BE 
FIRST BARRY PUTS THE BLOCK OF WOOD ONTO AN INSTRUMENT CALLED A LATHE 
HE USES THE LATHE TO CUT THE WOOD INTO THE SHAPE HE NEEDS 
CAN YOU TELL WHAT IT IS YET 
IT'S A RECORDER 
THE NEXT THING TO DO IS TO CARVE OUT THE HOLE TO LET THE AIR OUT 
IF BILL DIDN'T CARVE THE HOLE THE RECORDER WOULDN'T MAKE A NOISE 
WHEN YOU BLEW DOWN IT 
THE HOLE NEEDS TO BE JUST THE RIGHT SIZE AND SHAPE 
BILL VERY CAREFULLY CHOPS OUT THE HOLE USING A TOOL CALLED A CHISEL 
NOW HE IS DRAWING OUT THE MOUTHPIECE SO THAT HE CAN CUT IT OUT 
BILL HAS MADE LOTS OF RECORDERS 
SO HE KNOWS EXACTLY HOW TO MAKE THEM SAFELY 
NEXT HE FITS ANOTHER PIECE OF WOOD INTO THE MOUTHPIECE 
TO SQUEEZE THE AIR DOWN INTO THE RECORDER 
AH THAT SEEMS TO BE WORKING JUST FINE 
BILL VERY CAREFULLY CARVES THE MOUTHPIECE 
SO THAT IT FITS SNUGLY ON YOUR LIPS 
THERE THAT'S THE TOP OR HEAD OF THE RECORDER ALL DONE 
ALL THAT'S LEFT TO DO IS DRILL THE HOLES IN THE BOTTOM OF THE RECORDER 
TO MAKE THE DIFFERENT NOTES 
THE HOLES NEED TO BE EXACTLY THE RIGHT SIZE AND SHAPE 
SO THAT MARGARET CAN PLAY A NICE TUNE ON HER RECORDER 
SO THESE ARE CALLED RECORDERS TAMBA 
AREN'T THEY LOVELY YES THESE TWO LITTLE ONES OVER HERE 
ARE CALLED SOPRANINO RECORDERS AND THIS IS THE ONE MADE IN THE FILM 
OH TAMBA WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY PLAYING THE RECORDER 
CAN I YES OF COURSE THERE WE GO 
SEE IF YOU CAN BLOW INTO THAT 
AH YEAH THAT WAS GREAT 
OH CAN YOU YES READY 
HO HO PERHAPS YOU WERE TRYING A BIT TOO HARD LIKE SEBASTIAN

ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE MORE MUSIC LORNA NO I'M MAKING A BOX 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A LOOK YES PLEASE 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME TOO 
SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO USE THE RECORDER FOR LORNA

YOU CAN HAVE A ROUGH TEXTURE 
OR A SPIKY TEXTURE
