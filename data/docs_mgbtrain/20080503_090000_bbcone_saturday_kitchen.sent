MARCUS' POT HOT IS A REALLY HEARTY 
GUSTY DISH AND I'M LOOKING FOR A NO 
NONSENSE GREAT VALUE RED WITH BEEF 
YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT A JUICY 
BRIGHT NEW WORLD RED SUCH AS THIS 
BUT WITH STEAK THAT WOULD WORK WELL 
IF IT WAS RARE IN THIS CASE THE 
BEEF IS COOKED SLOWLY AND TAKES ON 
A GENTLE FLAVOUR AND I THINK THIS 
MIGHT BE IN DANGER OF OVERWHELMING 
THINGS ALSO THIS DISH HAS A 
SLIGHTLY SAVOURY SPICY NOTE AND 
THAT COMES FROM THE BROWN SAUCE SO 
I'M REALLY ON THE LOOKOUT FOR A RED 
WINE THAT IS GOING TO ENHANCE THAT 
TO DO THAT I'VE PICKED A WIN FROM 
THE WARM SOUTH OF FRANCE WHICH HAS 
A DISTINCTLY RUSTIC PEPPERY TWIST 
IN THE TAIL THIS IS LES DOUZE TWO THOUSAND SIX 
FITOU THIS IS A CLASSIC BLEND 
I PICK UP A HERSHEY NOTE BAY

BECAUSE IT'S A FERTILITY FESTIVAL CELEBRATING THE COMING OF SUMMER 
I'D GO ANYWHERE IN THIS WORLD BUT I'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO PADSTOW FOR MAY DAY NO QUESTION ABOUT IT 
OTHERS FEEL THE SAME WAY 
PADSTOW'S A TOWN LIKE EVERYWHERE ELSE PEOPLE HAVE THEIR BICKERING 
BUT ON THIS DAY ON OUR DAY EVERYBODY FEELS ONE AND ALL AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT 
THE DRUMS BEAT INCESSANTLY ALL DAY LONG AND THE O. S. S. DANCES OFF TO WATERING HOLES 
AND EVERYBODY'S VERY MERRY IN THE MERRY MORNING OF MAY 
THIS IS THE BEST AND WORST DAY FOR DOING THIS SALAD IT'S MAY DAY I'VE HAD A FEW DRINKS 
I'LL DO A KEITH FLOYD AND HAVE A LITTLE SIP NOW 
THIS LOBSTER IS GOING INTO THIS SEAFOOD SALAD IT'S A SPECIAL MAY DAY LOBSTER 
I'M NOT GOING TO CUT IT UP NOW IS THERE A PARTY JUST A MOMENT SOMEBODY SAID THERE WAS A PARTY 
THERE IS MARIE SHE WORKS FOR US BUT DON'T LET IT SHOW DON'T HOLD IT AGAINST ME RIGHT JOLLY GOOD 
THE LOBSTER TAKES A WHILE SO I'LL SHOW YOU THE OTHER THINGS THAT GO IN MAKE IT FOR TWENTY THIRTY POINT NINE OH PEOPLE 
NO PROBLEM EVERYTHING'S MADE UP BEFOREHAND SO ONE I MADE EARLIER REALLY DOES COUNT 
FIRST SOME NICE GREEN SALAD LEAVES 
THEN I FRIED SOME SQUID WHICH I SEASONED WELL WITH SALT AND PEPPER 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO FRY THE FISH YOU WANT LOTS OF FLAVOUR EVEN BEFORE YOU PUT THE FLAVOUR INGREDIENTS IN 
IT'S A THAI SALAD WE'VE GOT FISH SAUCE WE'VE GOT LIME LEAVES WE'VE GOT LEMON GRASS 
WE'VE GOT LOADS OF CHILLI PROBABLY MORE CHILLI THAN PEOPLE WOULD NORMALLY PUT UP WITH 
BUT ON THIS NOTABLE OCCASION THEY WON'T NOTICE BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD FAR TOO MUCH TO DRINK 
NOW SOME MONKFISH WHICH IS IDEAL FOR SALADS COS IT'S REALLY FIRM 
AGAIN I FRIED THIS OFF AND IT'S PICKED UP FLAVOUR FROM THE SQUID 
NOW I'VE COPPED OUT A BIT BUT I HAVE HAD A LITTLE BIT TO DRINK SO I'VE GOT ORDINARY FROZEN PRAWNS 
LOADS OF 'EM FEELING EXTREMELY GENEROUS HAD LOADS OF CHAMPAGNE WHICH SOMEBODY KINDLY GAVE ME 
SO I FEEL I'M RETURNING THE FAVOUR ON THIS DAY 
YOU GO INTO EVERYBODY'S HOUSES ALL OVER PADSTOW YOU JUST DROP IN YOU JUST CALL IN 
A GROANING TABLEFUL OF BITS AND PIECES HELP YOURSELF HAVE A DRINK DRIFT OUT TO THE NEXT HOUSE 
SO I'M RETURNING THE FAVOUR 
ON TOP OF ALL THAT SEAFOOD LOADS OF FRESHLY CHOPPED CORIANDER 
THIS IS AN EXCESSIVE DISH I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT QUANTITIES ONE TINY BIT 
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY THIS IS FOR 
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY WILL BE COMING LEMON GRASS LEMON GRASS 
LOADS OF THAT I LOVE THAI FLAVOURS I USE IT FAR TOO MUCH 
LIME LEAVES A REALLY LIMEY SEE YOU RICK CHEERS BYE 
LEMONY LIMEY FLAVOUR THEY'RE CALLED KAFFIR LIME LEAVES BUY 'EM IN ANY CHINESE SUPERMARKET NOW 
RICK ARE YOU COOKING OUR LUNCH YEAH YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT 
NOW SOME WILD GARLIC WHICH PERFUMES THE WOODS ALL ROUND PADSTOW 
THEN SOME FISH SAUCE LEMON GRASS AND CHILLI AND A LITTLE WATER 
MIX THAT INTO THE SALAD TO GIVE IT A REALLY NICE TANGY FLAVOUR 
SALADS LIKE THIS ARE A GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO BARBECUES ON SUMMERY DAYS 
AND I CAN GET STUCK INTO THE FOOD LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE RATHER THAN DOING THE COOKING 
PUTTING LOBSTER INTO THE SALAD MAKES IT RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE 
BUT IT IS MAY DAY SO LOBSTER IT HAS TO BE 
SEE WHAT I MEAN 
JUST LOOK AT THAT IT ADDS THE FINAL FINISHING BEAUTIFUL TOUCH TO A WONDERFUL SALAD 
THIS DISH IS ALWAYS A WINNER 
THIS TIME IT LASTED JUST FIVE GLORIOUS MINUTES NOT ENOUGH TIME FOR THE POOR DIRECTOR 
WHO'S NORMALLY FIRST IN THE QUEUE 
THAT WILD GARLIC IS SPONDONCULOUS 
MAY DAY FOR ME IS A TURNING POINT BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES IT BRING IN SUMMER 
IT ALSO BRINGS IN THE REALLY HARD WORK OF THE SUMMER SEASON 
I'M COOKING STIR FRIED PRAWNS 
THE CHEFS UPSTAIRS ARE GETTING MILITANT THEY'VE GOT CROSSER AND CROSSER 
I'M GOING TO DO A JOB IN WHAT THEY CALL REAL TIME STIR FRIED PRAWNS 
GARLIC INTO HOT OIL AND GINGER 
AND THE WHITE PART OF SOME SPRING ONIONS 
COOK THEM TOGETHER FOR ABOUT A MINUTE UNTIL YOU CAN SMELL THE GARLIC GOING BROWN 
YOU GET A SULPHUROUS BITTER SMELL COMING OFF WHICH IS DELICIOUS 
IN GO THE PRAWNS 
JUST STIR FRY THEM FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES UNTIL THEY START TO COLOUR NICELY 
YOU GET THESE IN MOST SUPERMARKETS RAW PRAWNS GO FOR THE RAW ONES 
TAKE OFF THE SHELLS DE VEIN THEM HALVE THEM PULL THE BLACK VEIN OUT 
NOW THE FLAVOUR I TOOK SOME SZECHUAN PEPPER A VERY PUNGENT CHINESE PEPPER 
I ROASTED IT IN A DRY WOK WITH NO OIL JUST LET IT GET REALLY HOT THEN GROUND IT 
AND THE KILLER BLOW IS THIS CHILLI BEAN SAUCE A MIXTURE OF POUNDED RED CHILLIS AND YELLOW BEAN SAUCE 
IN THIS CASE BLACK BEAN LOADS OF THAT I LIKE IT REALLY HOT 
WHACK THAT ALL AROUND NO PROBLEM REAL TIME COOKING HERE 
A A LITTLE TOMATO PUREE NOW SEEMS UNUSUAL IN CHINESE COOKING AND SOME SLICED TOMATOES AS WELL IN FACT IN SZECHUAN COOKING THEY DO USE TOMATOES QUITE A LOT 
SOME SOYA SAUCE AND SOME DRY SHERRY YOU CAN USE CHINESE RICE WINE BUT DRY SHERRY'S A GOOD SUBSTITUTE 
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THE GREEN TOPS OF THE SPRING ONIONS THE WHITE TOPS I PUT IN EARLIER 
STIR IT ALL AROUND AND THAT'S IT 
THREE TO FOUR MINUTES END OF STORY 
STRAIGHT INTO THE SERVING DISH BEAUTIFUL 
NO MESSING ABOUT WITH CHINESE COOKERY IT'S AS QUICK AS THAT 
TRY ONE DELICIOUS PERFECT 
GOD I LOVE CHINESE FOOD 
GREAT TO SEE RICK DOING A QUICK 
RECIPE IT'S ALWAYS USEFUL TO KNOW 
A FEW SIMPLE DISHES THAT YOU CAN 
THROW TOGETHER I'M GOING TO SHOW 
YOU ONE THAT IS EASY TO DO AND I'LL 
GUARANTEE IT WILL IMPRESS PEOPLE 
IT IS BREADED CHICKEN WITH 
COURGETTES AND TOMATOS THE 
COURGETTES TAKE THE LONGEST THE 
CHICKEN BECAUSE I WILL DO NICE 
LITTLE ASCALLOPE YOU HAVE 
TRAVELLED ALL OVER THE WORLD BUT 
IN YOUR CHILDHOOD ALSO 
I WAS BORN 
IN ITALY WE MOVED TO ENGLAND WHEN 
I WAS FOUR AND THEN TO AUSTRALIA 
WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN 
LOADS OF DIFFERENT 
FLAVOURS HOW WAS THAT AS A KID 
TASTING ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS 
MY MUM IS VERY GOOD COOK AND WE 
USED TO REALLY HAVE ITALIAN BASES 
IN THE THE KITCHEN IN EVERY WAY 
WHICH WAS A BIT SHOCKING FOR MY 
SCHOOL FRIENDS BECAUSE THEY HAD 
NEVER SEEN A FISH WITH EYES AND 
BONES AND TAIL THEY USED TO GET 
INTO THE HABIT OF GETTING AWAY 
BEFORE FOOD WAS SERVED 
DO YOU DO 
MUCH COOKING NOW 
I DO LOVE COOKING 
EXCEPT THAT ONCE YOU BECOME A MUM 
AND YOU'VE GOT FUSSY KIDS MOANING 
ABOUT ANYTHING THAT YOU DO THAT IS 
HAS GOT A BIT OF FLAVOUR THEY 
DON'T WANT TO SEE EVEN A PIECE OF 
ONION OR CELERY EVERYTHING HAS TO 
BE BLAND THAT DOES TAKE THE FUN 
OUT OF IT A BIT 
YOU HAVE GOT YOUR 
VEGETABLE PLOT YOU HAVE GOT AN 
ORGANIC VEGETABLE PLOT 
WE HAVE A 
BEAUTIFUL GARDEN AND MY HUSBAND 
DOES A FINE JOB OF PRODUCING 
ORGANIC VEGETABLES ALL THROUGH THE 
YEAR EXCEPT THAT THEY ALL COME THE 
AT ONCE EVEN THOUGH YOU SEED THE 
SALAD PATCH AND STAGGER THE SEEDING 
SOMETHING ABOUT THE THE ENGLISH 
WEATHER 
IT'S THIS TIME OF YEAR IT 
GOES CRAZY 
EVERYTHING COME OUT AND 
ANYONE WHO COMES TO THE HOUSE YOU 
GIVE THEM HANDFULS OF BEANS AND 
PEAS AND LETTUCE THE COURGETTES 
ARE GREAT BECAUSE THEY GO ALL YEAR 
ROUND THEY CRAWL ACROSS THE LAWN 
THEY 
ARE SIMPLE TO GROW YEAH THEY YEAH THEY ARE REALLY EASY 
VERY EASY AND IT'S 
NICE TO HAVE THE FLOWERS THE THE ITALIAN PEOPLE LOVE THE FLOWERS WE 
MUST SEND THEM OVER TO ITALY THEY THEY ARE DELICATE YOU NEED TO JUST 
PLUCK THEM FROM THE THE PLANT AND 
PUT THEM IN THE BATTER 
I'VE GOT 
THE BREAST HERE L. HAVE BATTERED 
ALL OUT AND FLOUR EGG AND BREAD 
CRUMBS THEY ARE JEP KNEES AND THEY 
MUCH MORE CRISP THEY DRY THE BREAD 
AND SHAVE THEM JAPANESE IT 
PRODUCES A REALLY CRISP CRUMB 
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED ABOUT THE OIL 
IN HERE BECAUSE YOU NEED TO PUT A 
FAIR AMOUNT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL 
BURN THE CRUMBS BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T 
GOT ENOUGH OIL PUT PLENTY IN THEN 
I WILL CHOP THE REST APART FROM 
THE VEGETABLES YOU HAVE BEEN BUSY 
DOING NEW PROGRAMMES ONE OF WHICH 
IS OUT LATER IN THE YEAR WHICH IS 
CLOSE TO MY HEART REALLY CASTLE 
HOWARD AND THE OLD BRIDES HEAD 
REVISITED I WAS BROUGHT UP THERE 
ALL MY LIFE 
AMAZING WHAT A 
BEAUTIFUL HUGE GARDEN AND WOODS 
AND 
THE LAKE AND THE HOUSE ISN'T THE BIGGEST PRIVATE HOUSE IN ENGLAND 
YES HUGE PLACE BRIEZHEAD ENGLAND MADE IT FAMOUS WHAT IS THE IDEA OF 
A NEW ONE BRIDESHEAD 
IT'S A VERY 
DIFFERENT FORM BECAUSE THE ONE WE 
ALL LOVED AND REMEMBER IF WE ARE 
OLD ENOUGH 
I REMEMBER IT L. USED 
TO EARN FIFTY TO SEND CHIPS TO JEREMY 
IRONS IN HIS TRAILER 
I REMEMBER I 
WAS A DRAMA STUDENT AND WE WERE ALL 
JUST IN AWE OF IT AND LOVED IT AND 
LOOKED UP TO THOSE ACTORS WHO I 
THOUGHT OF AS HALF A GENERATION 
OLDER THAN ME JEREMY IRONS AND 
ANTHONY ANDREWS AND DIANA QUICK AND 
IT SEEMS LIKE YESTERDAY THAT IT WAS 
ON T. V. L. THINK THE WHOLE WORLD 
REMEMBERS IT AND I THINK THEY DID 
IT IN A LUXURIOUS KIND OF THIRTEEN HOURS 
OR SOMETHING SO WHEN IT IS 
TRANSPOSED TO FILM IT IS TWO HOURS 
AT THE MOST SO IT'S GOING TO BE 
REALLY JEREMY BROCK WHO DID THE 
SCREEN PLAY ADAPTED IT REALLY 
BEAUTIFULLY BECAUSE HE DIDN'T TRY 
TO TELL THE WHOLE STORY OF THE BOOK 
HE TOOK A STRAND THE ESSENCE OF IT 
AND 
IT IS FOCUSED ON THAT L. THINK IT WILL BE VERY GOOD THE CAST ARE 
GREAT THE THREE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE 
FANTASTIC WE'LL NEVER FORGET 
JEREMY IRONS AND ANTHONY ANDREWS 
AND DIANA QUICK BUT THESE YOUNG 
ONES ARE TERRIFIC AND RATHER MORE 
PRECISELY CLOSE TO THE CHARACTERS 
IN THE BOOK 
WE LOOK TOWARD TO 
SEEING THAT AND SOMETHING ELSE YOU 
ARE DOING AT THE THE MOMENT A BIG 
PASSION OF YOURS IS THE STAGE AND 
THE PLAY TELL US ABOUT THAT I'M I'M DOING THE BEST ROLE THAT I'VE EVER 
HAD ON STAGE OR IN FILM AND IT'S 
ONE OF THE IT'S A RATTIGAN PLAY 
ONE OF THE GREATEST WRITERS IN THE 
ENGLISH THEATRE 
THIS IS CALL THE 
DEEP BLUE SEA 
THIS IS CONSIDERED 
HIS GREATEST PLAY YES HE IS UP 
THERE WITH IBSON OUR VERSION OF 
THEM GREAT FOR ACTORS AND GREAT 
CHARACTERS 
WHAT IS THE IDEA OF THE CHARACTERS STORY 
IT'S ABOUT OVERWHELMING STORY SEXUAL PASSION 
RIGHT MOVING ON TO 
THE CHICKEN THE GUESTS HAVE PERKED 
UP 
THAT HAS SOLD IT IN ONE UP SENTENCE 
MOVING ON TO OUR CHICKEN SENTENCE I AM GOING TO QUICKLY WHAT I'VE 
DONE HERE IS GOT THE COURGETTES AND 
TOMATOS AND ROSEMARY VERY ITALIAN 
IT IS NOW COOKED SEE THAT THIS IS 
A SERIOUS PORTION FANTASTIC 
IT IS FANTASTIC COOKED WE ARE GOING TO DRAIN THE 
OIL OUT AND THEN LAST MINUTE I'M 
GOING TO THROW IN THIS MIXTURE A 
BIT OF ONION GARLIC GERKINS 
PARSLEY CAPERS AND THE LOT GO IN 
AND MAKE LITTLE SAUCE 
I'M AMAZED YOU CAN HAVE A 
CONVERSATION WHILE YOU ARE DOING 
ALL THIS THAT'S WHAT I CAN'T DO 
WE CALL IT MULTI TASK DON'T WE 
MEN CAN'T DO THAT 
SALT AND PEPPER 
A BIT OF SALT L. HAVE GOT LEMON 
JUICE IN THERE WHEN I LOVE 
WHICH I LOVE THIS IS GREAT WITH 
BEEF AND STUFF LIKE THAT THIS 
SIMPLE LITTLE SAUCE IT'S JUST 
WONDERFUL THE FLAVOUR OF THE LEMON 
IT CUTS THROUGH THE BREADINESS OF 
THE CHICKEN AND THAT IS KOOD AND TO 
KEEP IT ITALIAN WE HAVE THE THE 
COURGETTES AND TOMATOS NOTHING 
FANCY THERE WE HAVE IT 
WOW IS 
THAT FOR ME 
THAT IS JUST FOR YOU 
FANTASTIC 
ALL FOR YOU 
I'M NOT FANTASTIC GOING TO SHARE IT WITH EVERYONE 
FORGET THEM DIVE IN 
THIS IS THE 
CLASSIC DISH OF MILAN WHERE I'M 
FROM IS THE MILANESE WHICH IS 
VEAL BUT THIS IS CHICKEN COOKED IN 
THE JAPANESE BREAD CRUMBS THEY ARE 
A GREAT IDEA 
DO YOU LIKE THAT 
VERY MUCH 
IS IT JUST NORMAL BREAD 
VERY GOOD 
WILL SHE BE EATING 
BARRAMUNDI IT IS QUICKLY PAN FRIED 
AND SERVED ON CREAMY MASH POTATO 
AND A PINCH OF CURRY POWDER OR FOOD 
HELL LARD A LARDY CAKE THERE ARE 
SUL TARN THATS AND SUGAR AND FLOUR 
AND ALL SPICE AND BAKE IT IT IS 
SERVED WITH A GOOD DOLL LOP OF 
HOME MADE BLACK PEPPER AND 
STRAWBERRY JAM THE GUESTS AND SOME 
OF THE VIEWERS GET TO DECIDE SO 
BRYN WHAT ARE YOU GOING FOR I I FANCY THE LARD OLIVIA 
I'M GOING OLIVIA FOR HEAVEN 
COMING UP BRYN HAS A 
SPECIAL DISH BUT FIRST IT'S TIME 
FOR THE VERY LAST LESSON IN EXPRESS 
COOKERY FROM NEITHER GEL LA SHE IS 
FINISHING OFF WITH COQ AU RIESLING 
NEITHER GEL LA NIGELLA 
FOR MIDWEEK COMFORT THE CLASSICS GET AN EXPRESS MAKEOVER 
TO HAVE THIS COQ AU RIESLING FOLLOWED BY JUMBLEBERRY CRUMBLE 
SOON ALL THE GORGEOUS SALTINESS 
WITH MELT WITH THE OIL THIS ALONG 
WITH A LEAK THE ONION'S SKINNIER 
COUSIN THIS WILL GIVE THE 
FOUNDATION FOR THIS NOW THIS IS A 
STEP I HAVE TO SHOULD SAY THAT I 
BUY LEAKS THAT ARE READY WASHED 
AND TRIMMED 
MY MOTHER WOULD BE SO ASHAMED 
I MEAN I KNOW PEELING AND CHOPPING AN ONION ISN'T HARD 
BUT IT CAN FEEL TIRING AT TIMES 
THESE GORGEOUS PALE GREEN DISCS TUMBLE IN 
WITH THE BACON 
NOW THIS NEXT STEP IS NOT ONLY SIMPLER 
BUT SPEEDS UP EVERYTHING UP 
AND THAT'S INSTEAD OF USING A WHOLE CHICKEN THAT'S BEEN JOINTED 
I TUMBLE IN TWELVE BONED SKINNED CHICKEN THIGHS 
YOU DON'T NEED TO SEAR THE MEAT ACTUALLY SO THAT'S EVEN EASIER 
EVERYONE GOES ON ABOUT CHICKEN BREASTS 
BUT I THINK THAT BROWN MEAT IS SO MUCH BETTER FOR FLAVOUR 
ADD THREE BAY LEAVES 
AND I REALLY CAN'T MAKE THAT ANY EASIER THAN IT IS 
BUT WHAT I CAN MAKE EASIER IS THAT 
INSTEAD OF GETTING LITTLE MUSHROOMS THAT YOU HAVE TO PEEL AND SLICE 
I GET OYSTER MUSHROOMS THREE HUNDRED G. OF OYSTER MUSHROOMS 
AND JUST TEAR THEM IN 
I LOVE FOOD LIKE THIS OLD FASHIONED 
GOING TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF A STIR 
NOT THAT IT'S REALLY NECESSARY 
AND THEN ADD A WHOLE BOTTLE OF RIESLING 
THIS DISH IS FROM THE ALSACE AND RIESLING'S FROM THE ALSACE 
IT HAS A GLORIOUS CITRUSY HONEYED TANG A GREAT FAVOURITE IN THE SEVENTIES 
A BIT OF TURBO CHARGE PEPPER 
AND NOW ALL I NEED TO DO IS LET THIS COME TO A BUBBLE TURN IT DOWN 
AND THEN LEAVE IT WITH THE LID ON TO SIMMER FOR ABOUT FORTY MINUTES 
AND SO THAT I DON'T HAVE ALL THAT HASSLE WITH POTATOES 
I'M GOING TO DO WHAT THEY DO IN ALSACE 
JUST COOK SOME NOODLES TOSS THEM IN A BIT OF BUTTER 
AND THEY WILL SOAK UP ALL THOSE GORGEOUS JUICES 
SO HERE WE ARE IT'S BUBBLING NOW 
I JUST HAVE TO PUT THE LID ON LOW SIMMER NO EFFORT 
IF YOU WANT TO GET FOOD ON THE TABLE FAST IT HELPS TO THINK AHEAD 
NOW OBVIOUSLY A FREEZER CAN BE USED TO STASH ENTIRE MEALS 
I THINK IT'S REALLY HELPFUL JUST TO KEEP KEY COMPONENTS 
BREADCRUMBS ESCALOPES ANYONE 
PUFF PASTRY ANY NUMBER OF DELICIOUS THINGS 
BERRIES ANY NUMBER AGAIN OF DELICIOUS THINGS 
LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL 
MY FAVOURITE USAGE FOR THESE BABIES IS MY JUMBLEBERRY CRUMBLE 
AND OF COURSE FOR A CRUMBLE YOU NEED THE TOPPING 
ALREADY THERE AND IT'S SO EASY TO MAKE A LIFESAVER 
I PUT TWO HUNDRED G. OF PLAIN FLOUR INTO A BOWL 
AND I ADD A TEASPOON OF BAKING POWDER 
IT'S NOT NORMAL TO DO THAT 
BUT I THINK IT GIVES THE CRUMBLE A LITTLE MORE LIGHTNESS 
NEXT I ADD ONE HUNDRED G. OF COLD UNSALTED BUTTER CUT INTO SMALL DICE 
AND I RUB THE FLOUR AND BUTTER TOGETHER AND BY THAT I MEAN 
I PRESS THE FLOUR AND BUTTER TOGETHER IN MY HANDS USING MY 
FOREFINGER AND MY MIDDLE FINGER AND PRESSING THEM IN A LIGHT 
FINALLY I SPOON SIX TABLESPOONS OF DEMERARA LOVELY CRUNCHY 
DEMERARA SUGAR INTO THIS MIXTURE AND THAT'S MY CRUMBLE TOPPING MADE 
I CALL THIS JUMBLEBERRY CRUMBLE BECAUSE IN O. L. D. ENGLISH COOKING 
WHEN THEY MADE JAMS OUT OF WHATEVER'S LEFT IN THEIR HEDGEROWS 
THEY JUST CALLED IT JUMBLEBERRY JAM AND I LOVED THE SOUND OF IT 
SO BEAUTIFUL NOW YOU CAN SEE THAT THESE BERRIES ARE QUITE MOUNDED UP 
AND IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE FROZEN AND THEY WILL SINK A LITTLE 
AS THEY COOK GIVING OFF THEIR WATER 
AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT THAT WE NEED TWO TEASPOONS OF CORNFLOUR 
IN OTHER WORDS I WANT TO MAKE A FRUIT SAUCE OUT OF 
THE WATER NOT JUST RUNNY LIQUID GLORIOUS AND RED THOUGH IT IS 
CORNFLOUR WILL ABSORB FASTER 
AND IT WON'T GIVE YOU THE FLOURY TASTE THAT REGULAR FLOUR WILL 
EVERYONE TELLS YOU YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE ALL THIS INTO A PASTE 
YOU DON'T AND I WANT FOUR TEASPOONS OF VANILLA SUGAR 
BY THAT I MEAN IT'S SUGAR WITH SOME VANILLA PODS IN 
BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT JUST USE ORDINARY SUGAR 
AND THEN A BIT OF VANILLA FROM A BOTTLE 
FOUR TEASPOONS ISN'T MUCH BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT 
THAT THE FRUIT HAS A TART EDGE TO IT 
AFTER ALL THE CRUMBLE TOPPING IS SWEET 
AND THERE'S GOING TO BE CREAM TO HELP EVERYTHING ALONG LATER 
NOW MIX THIS TOGETHER A BIT 
NOW MIX THIS TOGETHER A BIT 
NOW A LITTLE STREWING OF THE CRUMBLE MIX 
BEAUTIFUL PALE YELLOW AGAINST ALL THE DIFFERENT REDS OF THE BERRIES 
NOW YOU CAN AND PROBABLY SHOULD BREAK UP ANY LARGER CLUMPS 
BUT LEAVE A GOOD AMOUNT OF CLUMPAGE HERE 
BECAUSE IF IT'S ALL TOO FINE AND SANDY 
IT JUST WON'T HAVE THE RIGHT NUBBLINESS THAT CRUMBLE NEEDS 
YOU CAN SEE A FEW BERRIES PEEKING OUT AROUND THE EDGE 
BUT I LOVE IT WHEN AS IT COOKS 
THE RED JUICES COME UP A BIT AND FLOOD THE EDGES OF THE CRUMBLE 
TO THE OVEN 
BYE BYE DARLING DON'T READ TILL TOO LATE 
O. K. NIGHT 
NIGHT 
AS I SERVE EACH PERSON THEIR BOWL OF COQ AU RIESLING 
I LIKE TO SCATTER OVER SOME ANISEEDY DILL 
IT MAKES EVERYTHING LOOK SMELL AND TASTE PERFECT 
I LOVE THAT SUDDEN HIT OF GRASSY GREEN 
HERE WE ARE I HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY YES WE ARE WE'RE STARVING 
THEN I'LL LADLE OVER CAN I DEAL YOU
