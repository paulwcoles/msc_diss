HELLO WELCOME TO THIS WEEK'S SPRINGWATCH AND SPRINGWATCH WEATHER 
IT'S THIS WEEK THAT WE START TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE LATE SPRING SPECIES 
ONE OF THOSE IS THE HAWTHORN BLOSSOM OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE MAY FLOWER 
ONCE AGAIN THIS YEAR IT'S BEEN SEEN SEVERAL WEEKS EARLIER THAN EXPECTED 
THREE WEEKS EARLIER IN FACT BEFORE THE ONSET OF MAY 
IT WAS SEEN IN APRIL LIKE MANY TIMES IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS 
THAT SHOWS WHAT A MILD START TO THE YEAR IT WAS 
ALSO IT HASN'T BEEN AFFECTED BY THE FROST WE'VE HAD IN RECENT WEEKS 
IT'S A SURE SIGN THAT SUMMER IS ON THE WAY 
SURE ENOUGH TOMORROW DOES LOOK QUITE SPRINGLIKE 
YOU CAN SEE WHERE WE PICK UP THE OBSERVATIONS AS WE COME SOUTH 
NOW IT DOES LOOK AS IF WE WILL HAVE SOME SPRINGLIKE WEATHER DURING THE DAY ON TUESDAY 
WITH SOME SUNNY SPELLS DEVELOPING WIDELY ACROSS THE U. K. 
MOST OF US WILL STAY DRY AS WELL 
WE'VE HAD SOME RAIN DURING THE DAY ON MONDAY 
WE'RE JUST STARTING TO CLEAR IT AWAY 
FOR THE SOUTHWEST OF ENGLAND AND THE CHANNEL ISLANDS 
THEN IT'S A CASE OF MIST AND PATCHY FOG COMING AND GOING 
STILL A TOUCH OF FROST IN THE HIGHLAND GLENS OF SCOTLAND 
BUT MOST OF US WILL HAVE A MILD NIGHT ONCE AGAIN 
GOOD NEWS FOR GARDENERS WITH FROST FREE WEATHER THIS WEEK 
IT DOES MEAN THERE MIGHT BE MIST AND FOG AROUND IN THE MORNING 
IT WILL CLEAR QUICKLY ESPECIALLY IN THOSE AREAS WHERE WE'VE HAD THE RAIN 
IT DOES LOOK MUCH MORE PROMISING HERE 
FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AND WESTERN SCOTLAND THERE WILL BE MORE CLOUD 
THAN WE'VE SEEN DURING THE DAY 
THERE'S JUST THE POTENTIAL FOR A LIGHT SHOWER 
BUT I THINK THEY'LL BE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN 
THE EAST COAST OF SCOTLAND WE COULD HAVE LOW CLOUD HERE 
ALSO NORTHEAST ENGLAND BUT FOR MOST PARTS IT'S GOING TO BE DRY 
WITH SUNSHINE COMING THOUGH LIFTING THE LOW CLOUD AND HILL FOG 
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY LIFTING OUR TEMPERATURES 
THEY'LL START AROUND THE EIGHT OR NINE MARK IN THAT GLORIOUS SUNSHINE 
BUT COME THE AFTERNOON 
WE'RE EXPECTING TEMPERATURES HIGHER THAN THEY HAVE BEEN 
WE'LL HAVE A FEW SPOTS GETTING TO SIXTEEN DEGREES BUT MORE WIDELY FIFTEEN 
YOU CAN SEE THE CLOUD COMING AND GOING 
JUST THE OUTSIDE CHANCE OF A SHOWER IN THE WEST OF SCOTLAND 
PERHAPS LATER IN WALES 
BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT POTENTIALLY EIGHTEEN DEGREES TOWARDS LONDON 
BUT IT WON'T LAST 
COME THE EVENING WE SEE THIS NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM COMING 
BRINGING WITH IT RAIN SO QUITE A WET NIGHT FOR NORTHERN IRELAND 
IT DOES CLEAR ON WEDNESDAY MORNING TO SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS 
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A COLD NIGHT WEDNESDAY INTO TUESDAY 
WEDNESDAY DOES LOOK LIKE A WETTER DAY FOR MOST OF US 
THAT RAIN STAGGERING EASTWARDS A FEW HOURS FOR MOST OF US 
TEMPERATURES LIFTING IN THE SUNSHINE FOLLOWING TO FIFTEEN DEGREES CELSIUS 
THURSDAY AS WELL WE'LL SEE SOME PLEASANT SUNSHINE AHEAD OF THE RAIN 
BUT THAT DOES LOOK AS IF IT WILL SPREAD FURTHER SOUTH 
SO QUITE AN UNSETTLED END TO THE WEEK ENJOY THE SUNSHINE ON TUESDAY 
GOOD EVENING 
AH AH GET THAT ON CAMERA AH
