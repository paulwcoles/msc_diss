THE VOTES ARE IN 
IT IS OFFICIAL 
THIS IS YOUR FAVOURITE PROGRAMME 
BETWEEN TWELVE THIRTY P. M. AND ONE THIRTY P. M. ON A 
FRIDAY FRIDAY THIS IS WORKING LUNCH THEN AND 
GOOD AFTERNOON 
I AM ADAM SHAW TAKING THE LID OFF 
THE BILLION POUND SHARE SWINDLE 
THE SCAMMERS WERE MAKING THEMSELVES 
RICH AT YOUR EXPENSE 
RENTOKIL WITH US AS IT REPORTS A 
STAGGERING FIFTY NINE PER CENT DROP IN PROFITS 
I AM PADDY O'CONNELL ON THE ROAD 
WITH THE BAILIFFS WE WILL MEET THE 
COUPLE WHO TRACK DOWN PEOPLE WHO DO 
NOT PAY THEIR BILLS 
WE WILL BE ANSWERING YOUR HOLIDAY 
QUESTIONS QUESTIONS AND I AM MEETING THE PARTY PLANNER 
WHO BELIEVES COULD CLAMP RELATIONS 
AND THESE BIG PEACOCKS OF THE KEY 
TO SUCCESS 
IT'S BEEN REVEALED SHARE SCANDALS 
CAN EARN THOUSANDS OF POUNDS A YEAR 
BY CONNING PEOPLE OUT OF THERE 
ALIVE SAVINGS BOILER ROOMS 
INCLUDE COLD CALLING PEOPLE 
OFFERING THEM WORTHLESS SHARES IN 
A REPORT YESTERDAY SIMON MET 
SOMEONE WHO WORKED IN A BOILER ROOM 
AND TOLD HIM HOW THEY WORKED TODAY 
HE LOOKS AT SOME OF THE SCALES OF 
THESE OPERATIONS 
YESTERDAY WE MET THIS COUPLE FROM 
DORSET WHO ARE AFRAID THEY HAVE 
LOST FORTY THOUSAND TO A BOILER ROOM 
TOUTING OBSCURE SHARES FROM AN 
OFFICE OVERSEAS IT'S BEEN A 
DEVASTATING EXPERIENCE 
IT IS A 
VERY SINKING FEELING WHEN YOU FIND 
OUT YOU'VE LOST THIS MONEY THAT'S 
TAKING YOU A LONG TIME TO LEARN 
YOU HAVE LOST IT IT'S LIKE HAVING 
YOUR HOUSE BROKEN INTO THEY TAKE 
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE WORKED FOR YOU 
DON'T WANT IT IT'S A SINKING 
FEELING 
IN THEIR CASE THE FIRM FEELING APPEARED TO BE OPERATING FROM 
LUXEMBOURG BUT THE EXACT LOCATION 
IS OFTEN A MYSTERY SPAIN IS THE 
MOST POPULAR BASE FOR BOILER ROOMS 
THEY CAN WORK FROM BARCELONA 
MADRID OR THE COAST AND PRETEND TO 
BE IN BELGIUM HOLLAND SWITZERLAND 
OR ANYWHERE ELSE THE DEALER WHO 
DESCRIBED THE SCAM TO ME 
ANONYMOUSLY WAS BASED IN SPAIN FOR 
SEVERAL YEARS WE GET MESSAGES FROM 
VIEWERS WHO HAVE LOST UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND THAT IS THEIR SAVINGS 
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM BECAUSE IN 
YOUR THEIR EYES EUROPE CRIMINAL 
THERE'S NOTHING I COULD SAY TO 
APOLOGISE OR REDEMPTION THE PEOPLE 
WHO DO THIS WE ARE MATERIALISTIC 
PEOPLE SOMETIMES LOOK THE OTHER WAY 
NO MATTER WHAT THEIR MORAL VIEW IS 
YOU SHOW SOMEONE ENOUGH CASH PEOPLE 
ARE WILLING TO TURN THE OTHER CHEEK 
BOILER ROOMS KEEP A HOLD ON THE 
RECRUITS BY GIVING SOME SHE WAS 
REWARDS THIS IS THE ONE WE CREATED 
YESTERDAY THERE ARE TWENTY SALESMEN 
WATCHED OVER BY A FLOOR MANAGER WHO 
ARE BACKED UP BY CHIEF DEALERS WHO 
HELP OUT WHEN THE RIP OFF CALLS GET 
TRICKY THEN THERE ARE LOADERS TO 
PURSUE INVESTORS ONCE THEY HAVE 
BEEN CONNED ONCE TRYING TO GET THE 
REST OF THEIR SAVINGS SEVERAL 
SLOBBERS PROMISE THE VICTIMS THAT 
LOST FUNDS CAN BE RETRIEVED THEY 
HAVE TO PAY A HEFTY UPFRONT FREE 
FEET YET TRICKERY FROM A TEAM IT IT THRIVES BECAUSE IT IS A MULTI 
BILLION POUND INDUSTRY TAX FREE 
IT IS A MASSIVE CASH INDUSTRY THE THE BOILER ROOM RECEIVES EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE 
MONEY IT TAKES THE REMAINING TWENTY PER CENT 
GOES TO SO CALLED SOLICITORS WHO 
HANDLED THE FUNDS ALLOWING THE 
BOWLER ROOM TO MAINTAIN A LIE IT IS 
JUST ADVISING NOT SELLING UP TO 
THIRTY PER CENT GOES TO THE SALESMAN AS 
COMMISSION ALTHOUGH IF A LOADER 
MAKES THIS SO HE WILL TAKE HALF 
THE REST IS SPLIT BETWEEN A MANAGER 
CHIEF DEALERS AND THE OWNER A 
SHADOWY FIGURE LIKELY TO BE RUNNING 
TWENTY SIMILAR OFFICES IN EUROPE AND 
SOUTH EAST ASIA HOW BIG TO THE 
SALARIES GET 
ONE OF OUR OLD OWNERS 
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY NINE WERE FIFTY MILLION SILLY 
AMOUNTS OF MONEY LAST YEAR I TOOK 
OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN CASH SALESMEN SALESMEN LEARN FROM SCRIPS HAVE TO DO WITH 
ANY REBUTTAL SUCH AS I DON'T WANT 
TO TAKE ANY RISKS L. WILL THINK 
ABOUT IT THEY USED CLASSIC SALES 
TACTICS AND THEY WILL SOFTEN UP 
OFTEN OF THE TARGET OVER SEVERAL 
PHONE CALLS USUALLY IT IS A THREE 
CORE CLOSE 
THE OPEN THE WARM AND 
THE DEAL THEY SPEAK TO YOU GO 
THROUGH THE PITCH THE HALF AN HOUR 
CALL WHO WE ARE WHERE WE COME 
FROM WHAT WE DO AND HOW WE DO IT 
THE SECOND CALL MIGHT BE A COUPLE 
OF DAYS LATER 
THE TACTICS ARE 
FRIGHTENINGLY SUCCESSFUL A BOILER 
ROOM WITH TEN SALESMEN WOULD BE 
UNDER PRESSURE TO MAKE AT LEAST THIRTY 
SALES ARE WEAK AND OPENED TWELVE NEW 
ACCOUNTS THE FIRST SALE WOULD BE 
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND 
ALTHOUGH SIXTY PER CENT OF CUSTOMERS DON'T 
PAY OVER THIRTY PER CENT WILL MAKE A SECOND 
TRADE THREE TIMES THE SIZE WHAT 
ABOUT THOSE IN EXPERIENCED 
INVESTORS AND OFTEN ELDERLY PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE FAIRLIGHT SAVINGS THEY ARE 
DEPENDING ON IS IT A DIFFERENT 
APPROACH 
NEW INVESTORS ARE EASY APPROACH BECAUSE YOU MAKE IT SIMPLE IF THEY 
SAY THEY HAVE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND ARE 
LOOKING TO INVEST IT YOU START AT 
THE BASICS THEY ARE SO HAPPY AND 
GRATEFUL THEY ARE STARTING TO KNOW 
SOMETHING AND THEN INSTEAD OF 
SAYING YOU WILL TAKE THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
YOU SAY LET'S START WITH FIVE THOUSAND BUT 
THAT IS NOT WHAT THEY ARE EXPECTING 
EVEN IF THEY ARE HAPPY TO DO IT 
THE TRICK IS NOT TO DO IT IF THEY 
ARE HAPPY TO INVEST TWENTY THEY ARE 
MORE THAN HAPPY TO INVEST FIVE THOUSAND TWO 
WEEKS LATER WE WILL SEND THEM TO A 
LOADER WHO WILL REFER THEM TO 
PIECES 
HOW DO THEY DO THAT MANY PIECES MANY TECHNIQUES A LOT OF IT IS MAKING 
BUSINESS SENSE ONE OF THE GREAT 
QUESTIONS IS WHY WOULDN'T YOU 
INVEST THEY SAY IT IS NOT STIRLING 
NO CAPITAL YOU SELL THEM SOMETHING 
IN THEIR PARAMETERS 
IT IS A 
CRIMINAL OFFENCE EXPLAINS FRAUD 
SOLICITOR STEPHEN GILCHRIST TO SELL 
SHARES TO U. K. INVESTORS IF YOU ARE 
NOT AUTHORISED BY THE FINANCIAL 
SERVICES AUTHORITY IT COULD BE A 
CRIMINAL FRAUD 
REGARDLESS OF 
WHETHER THEY ARE LICENSED BY A 
FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY THEY 
ARE OPERATING FRAUD IF THEY ARE 
SELLING SOMETHING IT DOES NOT EXIST 
OR IF THEY MAKE REPRESENTATIONS TO 
PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT IT IS THEY ARE 
BUYING AND THEY MISREPRESENTS THE 
PRODUCT THAT IS BEING SOLD THE 
RESALE OF THE VALUE OF THE SHARE 
HOW EASY IT IS TO RESELL A SHARE ON 
A STOCK MARKET 
EVEN SO THE 
SCAMMERS ARE PINNING THEIR HOPES ON 
A NEW WAY OF HOCKING UNSUSPECTING 
VICTIMS USING PLAUSIBLE LOOKING 
INTERNET WEBSITES TO TEMPT THEM 
INTO ASKING FOR INVESTMENT ADVICE 
IT IS A TROJAN HORSE THEY COME 
STRAIGHT FOR US THERE ARE PEOPLE 
WHO ARE NOT INTERESTED BUT IT IS 
THE NUMBERS GAME IF YOU ARE 
CALLING NAME AND NUMBER ONE IN 
FIFTY WILL BE INTERESTED THERE IS A 
LOT OF REJECTION BUT OUT OF TEN 
LEEDS NINE OF THEM WILL BE HAPPY 
TO BUY 
THE BOILER ROOM SALES THEM 
BELIEVE THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH THIS 
BY WORKING OVERSEAS BY CHANGING 
THE NAMES OF THE COMPANIES THEY ARE 
WORKING THROUGH AND BY MOVING 
OFFICES SO SO MUCH IS BEING 
SIPHONED OFF FROM U. K. INVESTORS THAT 
CLAMPING DOWN ON THESE BOILER ROOMS 
HAS BECOME AN URGENT CHALLENGE IT 
IS DIFFICULT FOR THE POLICE TO 
PURSUE BOILER ROOM CRIMINALS EVEN 
IN THE EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRY SUCH 
AS SPAIN IF YOU ARE HUNTING AND ON 
EXISTING SHARE IT IS FRAUD IF YOU 
ARE MISS SELLING A SHARE THAT DOES 
EXIST AND IS REGISTERED ON THE 
STOCK EXCHANGE WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
IS WRONG IN TERMS OF THE FINANCIAL 
SERVICES AND MARKETS ACT AND THEY 
COULD BE BREACHING THE FINANCIAL 
SERVICES RULES 
THEY COULD EVEN BE 
BREACHING THE CRIMINAL LAW WITHIN 
THE FINANCIAL SERVICES ACT IN THE 
SENSE OF PROMOTING AN INVESTMENT 
WITHOUT HAVING A LICENCE BUT IT 
MAY FALL SHORT OF FRAUD YOU 
GENERALLY FIND THINGS LIKE 
INTERNATIONAL ARREST WARRANTS AND 
REQUEST FOR EXTRADITION ONLY APPLY 
TO THE MORE SERIOUS CATEGORY OF 
CRIMINAL OFFENCES BRITAIN'S BRITAIN'S FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY 
ENCOURAGES THE PUBLIC TO GO ON THE 
INTERNET TO CHECK ON ITS REGISTER 
WHETHER FIRMS ARE AUTHORISED TO 
SELL INVESTMENTS IN THE U. K. IT HAS 
A LIST OF FOREIGN FIRMS TOUTING 
ILLEGALLY FOR BUSINESS THE TACTIC 
HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE BUT IT HAS 
HAD A SINISTER SIDE EFFECTS THIS 
EXPERIENCE DEALER CLAIMS BOILER 
ROOMS WILL INCREASINGLY SEEK COVER 
FROM AUTHORISED ADVISERS WHO ARE 
DESPERATE FOR BUSINESS 
WHAT THE 
FUTURE IS LOOKING TO BE HIS 
COMPANIES JOINING UP WITH LICENCE 
FIRMS IN THE AND EUROPE TO 
HOLD A FULL BROKERAGE LICENCE WHAT WHAT WOULD THAT ENABLE YOU TO DO IT IT GIVES US MORE CREDIBILITY WHAT A 
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DOING BECAUSE 
THEY KNOW THERE ARE LOT OF BOILER 
ROOMS THEY CHECKED THE F. S. A. WEBSITE 
IF YOU CAN GIVE THEM SOMETHING LIKE 
THAT THEIR MIND IS AT EASE IT IS 
O. K. THEY ARE REGULATED 
THE F. S. A. HAS 
SWOOPED ON SEVERAL AUTHORISED FIRMS 
WHO HAVE BEEN HELPING BOILER ROOMS 
YET THE BOILER ROOMS THEMSELVES 
HAVE AN HABIT OF SLIPPING THROUGH 
THE REGULATOR'S FINGERS THEY ARE 
CRIMINALS WHY CAN'T YOU GET THEM 
WE HAVE LOT 
OF ACTIVITY IN TERMS OF WHAT WE DO TO ADDRESS BOY ROOMS 
I PERSONALLY THINK THE BEST THING 
WEEK TO DO IS EDUCATE PEOPLE NO 
ONE TO CHOOSE TIME SHARE WITHOUT 
TAKING ADVICE BECAUSE OF THE 
TIMESHARE SCAM WE HEARD ABOUT IN 
THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES IF PEOPLE KNOW 
WHAT A BOILER ROOM IS THEY CALL 
YOU OUT OF THE BLUE AND THEY TRY TO 
SELL YOU SOME SHARES AND SOUND VERY 
FRIENDLY ABOUT IT IF THEY TRY TO 
DO THAT HANG UP THE PHONE THAT 
CURES THE PROBLEM 
THE F. S. A. ARE USELESS LOOK WHAT 
HAPPENED WITH NORTHERN ROCK THEY 
NEED A SHAKE UP IF THEY WANTED TO 
SHUT IT DOWN THEY COULD IF THE 
POLICE WANTED TO CLOSE DOWN SHOPS 
THEY COULD EASILY DO IT 
HE CLAIMS THERE ARE BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED FIVE 
HUNDRED BUOY ROOMS ACTIVE IN SPAIN 
ALONE THE POLICE HAVE HAD SOME 
SUCCESS THEY HELPED CLOSE DOWN A 
FLORIDA BOY ROOM WITH FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
VICTIMS THE F. S. A. RETRIEVED A 
MILLION POUNDS FROM CANADA THOSE 
ARE JUST DENSE IN HIS BILLION POUND 
YEAR RIP OFF INDUSTRY 
SIMON RIGHT FROM WHEN YOU TALKED 
ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY I STARTED 
GETTING E. MAILS AS YOU WERE TALKING 
ABOUT THIS AND THEY HAVE CONTINUED 
TO COME IN WHAT IS THE FLAVOUR OF 
THEM THEM A LOT OF THE SPONSORS AND LOT OF 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED OTHERS 
SAY THEY ARE NOW WARNED ROSS A 
STUDENT GOT INVOLVED HE SAID HE 
WAS CONCERNED WHEN HIS SHARE 
CERTIFICATES ARRIVED U. S. SHARES HE 
BOUGHT WITH A POSTMARK FROM IPSWICH 
RATHER THAN LAS VEGAS HE SAID HE 
WAS LUCKY HE ONLY LOST ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
ANDY FROM NEWCASTLE IS ONE OF THE 
FEW WHO CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW 
PEOPLE CAN BE GULLIBLE AND TO GET 
TAKEN IN 
JEAN HAS DISCOVERED IN THE LAST TWO 
WEEKS HER ELDERLY PARENTS HAVE 
BECOME VICTIMS OF A BOILER ROOM TO 
THE TUNE OF TWENTY THOUSAND 
ANDREW FROM HAMPSHIRE HE IS 
CONCERNED HE IS DEALING WITH A 
BOILER ROOM AT THE MOMENT TWENTY THOUSAND 
HAS GONE THEY HAVE BEEN RINGING 
HIM UP AGAIN TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE 
HIM TO PUT MORE MONEY THEIR WAY 
STOP ANDREW LOOK AT THE F. S. A. 
WEBSITE RING THEM UP IF NEED BE 
THOSE NUMBERS ARE GOING UP ON THE 
SCREEN YOU CAN GET IN TOUCH AND 
ASK THEM ABOUT IT THE FIRM HE 
MENTIONS IT IS NOT ON THE F. S. A. LIST 
OF AUTHORISED FIRMS IT IS ON THEIR 
LIST OF UNAUTHORISED FIRMS THEY 
ARE OPERATING IN THE U. K. 
IT IS A 
KNOWN ROGUE 
YES HE SHOULDN'T BE 
DEALING WITH THEM 
MARIO KELLY SAYS VERIFIED THE 
COMPANY'S REGULATED BY THE HOST 
REGULATOR FROM THE COUNTRY THEY ARE 
PHONING YOU FROM 
IN SPAIN HE SAYS IT IS THE C. N. M. V. 
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN LISTS OF WHO IS 
AUTHORISED TO OPERATE L. WANTED TO 
SHOW YOU IN DETAIL A MESSAGE 
ANGELA HAS SENT HER TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD 
SON ANSWERED AN ADVERTISEMENT IN 
THE PAPER TO GO OUT TO SPAIN TO 
WORK IN WHAT 
WORK IN WHAT 
APPEARS TO A BOILER 
WORK IN WHAT APPEARS TO A BOILER ROOM THEY PAID FOR HIS FLIGHT 
PUTTING IN A FLAT WITH ANOTHER 
YOUNGSTER THEY PAID HIM ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE EUROS 
A WEEK THEY WERE MADE TO WORK ON 
THE PHONES A TWELVE HOUR DAYS THEY 
HAD NO SEATS AND THEY WERE TOLD 
THEIR VOICE PROJECTED BETTER IF 
THEY WERE STANDING UP 
THEY WERE TOLD TO SAY THEY WERE 
CALLING FROM HONG KONG AND SO THEY 
WERE NOT BOUND BY F. S. A. RULES THEY 
EVEN HAD THE WEATHER PROJECTED ON 
THE SCREEN THE WEATHER FROM HONG 
KONG BY THE END OF SIX WEEKS HE 
REALISED IT WAS A SCAM AND WAS 
BROKE AND HIS MOTHER INSISTED HE 
RETURNED HOME SHE SAYS THESE 
PEOPLE ARE TARGETING IMPRESSIONABLE 
YOUNGSTERS WITH THE PROMISE OF A 
WONDERFUL LIFE IN THE SUN WITH THE 
POTENTIAL OF FUTURE EARNINGS THE 
REALITY IN THIS CASE WAS DIFFERENT 
THE REALITY FOR OTHERS IS CLOSER 
BECAUSE THEY ARE RAKING OFF 
MILLIONS OF POUNDS 
ONE CALLER SAYS HE ASKED FOR THE 
F. S. A. NUMBER 
A LOT OF PEOPLE HANG UP 
THAT'S A BETTER STRATEGY SOME 
PEOPLE EVEN PLAY LOUD NOISES TO 
THEM DOWN THE PHONE THERE ARE 
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO DEALING 
WITH THIS ONE THING THAT THE 
FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY IS 
WORRIED ABOUT AT THE MOMENT IS 
THESE ONES WHO ARE PRETENDING TO 
COME FROM AUTHORISED FIRMS A WAY 
YOU CAN DEAL WITH THAT IS FIND OUT 
THE NAME OF THE PERSON WHO IS 
TALKING TO YOU LOOK AT THE 
FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY 
REGISTER OF AUTHORISED FIRMS FINE 
THE ONE THEY'RE CLAIMING TO BE FROM 
THE TELEPHONE NUMBER IS THERE RING 
THEM AND SEE IF THIS PERSON WORKS 
FOR THEM THAT'S ONE VAT SKWREU IF 
YOU ARE THAT'S ONE STRATEGY 
BASICALLY I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF A 
LEGITIMATE BROKERS CALLING SOMEONE 
OUT OF THE BLUE TRYING TO SELL THEM 
SHARES IT'S UNUSUAL BE SUSPICIOUS 
PARTICULARLY IF THEY'RE FROM SPRAIN 
OR SOUTH EAST S. P. R. SPAIN OR SOUTH 
EAST ASIA 
GET A DOG AND THEY CAN 
BARK DOWN THE PHONE 
I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU A QUESTION 
AT THE HEART IS A SHARE THAT EXISTS 
ISN'T IT THIS IS WHAT INTERESTS ME 
I HEARD YESTERDAY THEY'RE GOING TO 
SEE HOW MUCH RESID ANNUAL VALUE 
THERE IS SO IS IT THEY SAY THIS 
SHARE IS WORTH TEN WHEN IT'S WORTH 
FIVE WHERE IS THEIR MONEY MADE FROM 
SOME ARE SHARES WORTH MAYBE A PENNY 
BUT NOTHING MUCH AND THEY'VE SOLD 
THEM TO YOU FOR A ONE YOU CAN'T 
SELL THEM YOURSELF AFTER THAT SOME 
ARE WORTHLESS BITS OF PAPER THAT 
ARE NOTHING THE WORRYING ONES NOW 
ARE THE CLONED SHARES WHERE THEY'RE 
PRETENDING IT'S A SHARE IN A BIG 
COMPANY LIKE GOOGLE OR MICRO 
MICROSOFT BUT THEY'RE SET UP 
COPYCAT GOOGLE IN PANAMA OR A 
COUNTRY LIKE THAT TAKE THE MONEY 
TO PANAMA AND YOU ARE NEVER GOING 
TO SEE IT AGAIN 
ONE OF THE OTHER MANY QUESTIONS YOU 
HAVE ANSWERED THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
I HAVE SOME OTHER BUSINESS NEWS NOW

ANNOUNCED PLANS TO CUT THE PRICE OF 
CALLS TO OH EIGHT SEVEN OH NUMBERS THE 
COMMUNICATIONS WATCHDOG WANTS THOSE 
OH EIGHT SEVEN OH NUMBERS TO COST NO MORE THAN 
CALLS TO WHAT IT CALLS GEOGRAPHIC 
NUMBERS I SUPPOSE THAT MEANS 
DESTINATION LOCAL CODES THE 
PROPOSAL ALSO ALSO IMPROVE 
PROTECTION FOR CUSTOMERS CALLING 
OH EIGHT SEVEN ONE LINES BY BRINGING THEM UNDER 
THE REMIT OF PREMIUM RATE SERVICES

EVERYWHERE ON THE MAJOR MARKETS OF 
THE WORLD JONATHAN JONATHAN 
COMPTON IS WITH US WE DRAGGED FROM 
YOU YOUR SICK BED I HEAR 
YOU HAVE 
ARE YOU FEELING O. K. 
I WILL SURVIVE 
I WILL TRY AND CHANGE THAT WHAT DO 
YOU RECKON OF THE MARKETS GOOD GOOD NEWS EVERYONE IS MAKING MONEY THE 
BAD NEWS IS IT'S BULK IS A RELIEF 
RALLY THIS IS THINGS NOT AS 
BAD 
AS 
PEOPLE THOUGHT YOU HAD THAT SHOCK 
OF THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND THE 
HALLY TPBGS RAISING TWELVE BILLION 
TEEN THEM ONE PER CENT OF THE ECONOMY YOU 
HAD LOTS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES 
BOUNCING AND THEY'VE BEEN BOUNCING 
BECAUSE THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN GOOD 
RETAILERS LIKE LIKE NEXT ARE 
BOUNCING NEXT WAS TWENTY FOUR LAST YEAR 
IT'S NOW TWELVE ALMOST AS IF WE 
IT'S NOW TWELVE 
PLANNED IT THERE IS SOME OF THE 
BOUNCES OVER THE WEEK NEXT THE 
BEST PERFORMER FOLLOWED BY MARKS 
AND SPENCER 
M. AND AMP S. HAD GOT OVERSOLD 
PEOPLE GOT CONFUSED WITH THE ROWS 
OVER STUART ROSE HIM HAVING A 
SHARE IN ANOTHER COMPANY WITH A 
CLASH OF INTERESTS THERE ISN'T ONE 
AGAIN MARKS AND SPENCER LOST THIRTY FIVE PER CENT 
LAST SIX MONTHS B. A. IS INTERESTING 
B. A. ANNOUNCED THEY'RE CONSIDERING 
TRANSATLANTIC FLIGHTS MAYBE A TIE 
UP WITH CONTINENTAL AMERICAN 
AIRLINES MAYBE A TAKEOVER THEY'RE 
TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR FRANCHISE 
BOTH ENDS 
YOU WOULD THINK BRITISH 
AIRWAYS WOULD BE BADLY AFFECTED 
WE ARE COMING UP TO THE SUMMER 
EVERYONE THINKING ABOUT HOLIDAYS 
IF PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE 
ECONOMY SURELY THE FIRST THING TO 
GO IS EXPENSIVE FLIGHTS AND THEY'RE 
GOING TO BE HIT BY MASSIVE RISES IN 
OIL PRICES THAT'S A COMPANY WHICH 
SHOULD BE ONE OF THE WORST 
PERFORMERS BUT IT'S ONE OF THE BEST 
ABSOLUTELY OIL PRICES ARE HURTING 
THEM ALL BUT THE TRANSATLANTIC 
ROUTES IT'S NOT THE TOURISTS IT'S 
MORE THE BUSINESS TRAVELLER AGAIN 
IT'S PEOPLE THINK ARMAGEDDON IS NOT 
GOING TO HAPPEN PERHAPS BUSINESS 
TRAVEL WILL PICK UP 
ONE OTHER 
THEORY WHICH DISPROVED THIS WEEK 
WAS HOME RETAIL WHICH OWNS 
HOMEBASE I THINK L. HAVE HEARD 
PEOPLE SAY THAT'S A COMPANY THAT 
SHOULD DO WELL BECAUSE IF PEOPLE 
ARE NOT GOING TO SPEND FORTUNES ON 
MOVING HOME THEY MIGHT DO UP THEIR 
OWN HOME YET ALTHOUGH IT'S DONE 
WELL THIS WEEK THE SHARES OVER THE 
YEAR HAVE NOT NOT PERFORMED AS WELL 
THEY DONE BADLY AND I HAVE 
FEELING IT WAS THE SAME IN NINETEEN NINETY 
INITIALLY PEOPLE SAID CAN'T HELD MY 
HOME I WILL DO IT UP AND THAT 
STOCK WENT UP ABOUT NINE MONTHS IN 
PEOPLE WERE ALSO SHORT OF MONEY 
THEY COULDN'T GET THE CREDIT AND IT 
FELL OVER AGAIN 
SO EVERYTHING GOES 
LET'S LOOK AT THE DOWNSIDE THEN 
SMITH AND NEPHEW A PHARMACEUTICAL 
COMPANY 
SMITHS HAS BEEN A SLIGHT COMPANY SHOCKER GOOD COMPANY LAST YEAR IT 
BOUGHT A SWISS COMPANY AND THEY 
FOUND WITHIN THE SWISS COMPANY A 
GREEK COMPANY WHERE THE ACCOUNTS 
LOOKED VERY DODGY THEY ANNOUNCED A 
BIG INVESTIGATION THERE IS AL BIG 
HIT THIS THIS MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN 
GOOD FOR SO LONG PEOPLE ARE 
SHOCKED BY THIS LOSS 
THE MINING 
COMPANIES IS IT JUST THESE THINGS 
ARE LIKE GO TO THE FAIR UP ONE 
MINUTE DOWN IT'S A ROLLERCOASTER 
RDZ IS INTERESTING THIS ONGOING 
BID BETWEEN FOR RZZ IS DRAWING OUT 
THIS ONE IS GOING TO RUN ALL YEAR 
ONE THING I MENTIONED AT THE TOP OF 
THE PROGRAMME TO SIMON I DIDN'T 
THINK MOST LEGITIMATE COMPANIES 
EVERY COLD CALLED INVESTORS TO SELL 
THEM SHARES WAS 
I BEING UNFAIR NO NO I THINK YOU ARE COMPLETELY RIGHT 
WHY WOULD I CALL YOU TO MAKE YOU 
ONE M. I. L. L. I. O. N. WHY DON'T I BORROW THE 
MONEY MYSELF FROM THE BANK OF 
COURSE I DON'T 
SO THAT IS 
SOMETHING TO WATCH OUT FOR THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL TALK LATER 
ABOUT THE WEEK AHEAD 
THE LATEST FIGURES FOR THE NUMBERS 
OF PEOPLE FACING INSOLVENCY HAVE 
BEEN RELEASED THIS MORNING AND THEY 
PAINT AN INTERESTING PICTURE WHICH 
WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THE NUMBER 
OF PEOPLE IN ENGLAND AND WALES 
APPLYING THROUGH THE COURTS TO HAVE 
THEIR DEBTS REMOVED IS UP ONE SEVENTEEN PER CENT IN 
THE LAST THREE MONTHS WHICH WE 
HAVE CALLED QUARTER ONE DOWN HERE 
TO TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR COMPARED TO LAST YEAR 
YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE DOWN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO PER CENT 
FROM TWENTY NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN DOWN ON THE YEAR UP 
ON THE QUARTER THE FIGURES FOR 
SCOTLAND ARE BOTH DOWN AND DOWN 
FIVE POINT SIX PER CENT ON THE YEAR FROM THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE THAT'S 
ALL SEE AND NO SAW IN SCOTLAND 
THE FIGURES FOR NORTHERN IRELAND 
ARE UP THREE HADN'T FOUR PER CENT IN THE LAST 
THREE MONTHS AGAIN WE HAVE CALLED 
QUARTER ONE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BUT DOWN THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT ON 
THE YEAR TO EXPLAIN ALL THIS WE 
ARE JOINED BY MARK SANDS DIRECTOR 
OF PERSONAL INSOLVENCY AT K. P. M. G. WE 
HAVE GOOD PEOPLE WITH GRAPHICS YES YES YOU HAVE 
MOIRA KNOWS WHAT SHE IS 
DOING THERE HAS BEEN THIS BUBBLE 
OF THE LAST THREE MONTHS WHAT DOES 
IT MEAN HOW DO YOU READ THE 
FIGURES 
IT MEAN HOW DO YOU READ THE FIGURES 
I THINK THE LAST THREE FIGURES MONTHS ARE THE FIGURES WE SHOULD BE 
WATCHING THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY MORE 
RECENT THEY'RE GOING TO BE SHOWING 
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE YEAR AHEAD 
AND THINGS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT A 
YEAR AGO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF 
DISCUSSION OVER THE LAST YEAR ABOUT 
THE USE OF INDIVIDUAL VOLUNTARY 
ARRANGEMENTS THE FLEXIBLE 
ALTERNATIVE TO BANKRUPTCY HAS BEGUN 
THROUGH A REVIEW THAT'S AT AN END 
THERE WAS ROW I BELIEVE BETWEEN 
THE BANKS AND THE DEBT AGENCIES IS 
THAT RIGHT 
THERE WAS A CONCERN 
OVER THE APPROPRIATE USE OF AN 
INDIVIDUAL VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT 
AND WHETHER THEY WOULD PERHAPS WERE 
BEING MISSOLD SO THE VARIOUS STAKE 
HOLDERS GOT TOGETHER DISCUSSED THE 
ISSUES AND HAVE PUT IN PLACE A 
PROTOCOL THAT CAME INTO EFFECT IN 
FEBRUARY WHICH WON'T HAVE FED 
THROUGH INTO THE FIGURES WE ARE 
SEEING THAT WE THINK WILL RESULT IN 
FURTHER FURTHER INCREASES IN THE 
YEAR AHEAD 
THERE IS SO MUCH DEBT WITH THE 
CONSUMERS THAT THIS IS A LONG TERM 
TREND OF UPWARDS NUMBERS WE HAVE 
MERELY SEEN A TEMPORARY REPAOEUT 
AS WELL AS COMING HERE TO SPEAK TO 
US YOU SEE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE TO 
HEAD TOWARDS AN I. V. A. L. WAS LOOKING 
AT THE FIGURES YOU SAY THAT THE 
AVERAGE DEBT OWED BY SOMEONE 
ENTERING AN I. V. A. WAS FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND THE 
AVERAGE DEBT 
THAT'S RIGHT 
CAN YOU 
EXPLAIN TO ME HOW PEOPLE GET THERE 
I CAN UNDERSTAND ONE STEP LEADING 
TO ANOTHER CAN YOU PAINT A PICTURE 
NO NAMES OF SOMEONE WHO HAS GOT TO 
THIS FIGURE HOW IT HAPPENED IT IT SEEMS AN HORRENDOUS FIGURE THAT'S 
AN AVERAGE I MET UP WITH A CLIENT 
LAST WEEK WHO OWED AROUND SIXTY THOUSAND 
AND I ASKED THEM THE SAME QUESTION 
HOW HAVE YOU GOT INTO THIS TWO 
THINGS FIRST OF ALL I DON'T THINK 
THEY REALISE THE EXTENT OF THEIR 
DEBT UNTIL I SAT THEM DOWN AND MADE 
THEM ADD IT UP A LOT OF PEOPLE 
LOOK AT MONTHLY OUTGOINGS RATHER 
THAN LOOKING AT THE TOTAL DEBT 
THEN I ASKED ABOUT IT AND IT'S 
BUILT UP OVER SEVERAL YEARS THERE 
HAD BEEN A FEW FEW THOUSAND POUNDS 
ON A CONSERVATORY COUPLE OF 
THOUSAND ON A HOLIDAY A SECOND 
HAND CAR AND THAT WAS THE START OF 
IT THE REST OF IT WAS BUILT UP 
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS OF 
PAYING THE HOUSEHOLD COSTS BECAUSE 
THEY HAD SO MUCH GOING OUT ON THE 
MAIN DEBT AND INTEREST AND CHARGES 
BUILDING UP IT ALL JUST SNOWBALLED 
TO THIS SIXTY THOUSAND FIGURE WHICH THEY 
WERE ASTOUNDED AT AS WELL LET'S LET'S SAY I HAVE A CONSERVATORY HOLIDAY 
AND A HOUSE MIGHT BE UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND 
I AM GUESSING I LUMP IN THE GAS 
ELECTRIC FOOD CLOTHES SHOES FOR 
THE KIDS WHEN WHEN BY THE TIME YOU 
ADDED I STILL COULDN'T PAY THE 
INITIAL OUTGOING WITH THE INTEREST 
THREE FOUR YEARS LATER I HAVE 
SIXTY THOUSAND 
THAT'S THE SCENARIO WE ARE SIXTY THOUSAND SEEING TIME AND TIME AGAIN PEOPLE 
AREN'T ENTERING INTO DEBT WITH A 
STRATEGY FOR REPAYING IT THEY LOOK 
AT THE INDIVIDUAL DEBT THINK THEY 
CAN AFFORD THAT WHAT PEOPLE NEED 
TO DO IS BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT 
THEY'RE TAKING ON VA PLAN FOR WHAT 
THEY'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT RATHER 
THAN LEAVING THAT FOR TOMORROW 
THAT LAST BIT WE WILL RETURN TO 
TIME AND AGAIN HOW TO STRUCTURE 
HOW TO PLAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
PEOPLE WITH LOT OF DEBT CAN IN 
EXTREME CASES HAVE THEIR HOMES 
REPOE REPOSSESSED OR BE VISITED 
BY BAILIFFS WHO CAN TAKE GOODS TO 
PAY OFF BILLS ONE COMPANY CLAIMS 
IT'S CHALLENGING THE TRADITIONAL 
VIEW OF BAILIFFS AND HAS SET UP A 
CHARITY FOR THOSE HARDEST HIT BY 
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS JENNY SPENT DAY WATCHING THEM AT WORK 
HUSBAND AND WIFE TEAM GARY AND SUE 
HAVE BEEN COLLECTING DEBTS IN 
ASSETS FOR OVER FOUR YEARS THEY 
ARE HIGH COURT ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS 
CHASING UNPAID BILLS ON BEHALF OF 
THE HIGH COURT 
JUST OVER FOUR THOUSAND WITH 
COSTS IT IS A COMMERCIAL DEBT BUT 
IT WILL BE A DOMESTIC ADDRESS THEY THEY WORK FOR A COMPANY CALLED SHARE 
GREW 
WE ARE LOOKING THROUGH THE GREW KEYHOLE OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES WE HAVE A UNIQUE 
VANTAGE POINT 
CLAIRE IS THE 
COMPANY CHEEK EXECUTIVE SHE IS 
RUNNING A MONTHLY TRAINING SESSION 
IT IS ABOUT A CHARITY THEY HAVE SET 
UP TO HELP HIT THOSE HIT HARDEST BY 
BAD DEBTS THE COMPANY IS KEEN TO 
DISTANCE ITSELF FROM THE GNASHED 
THE USUAL IMAGE OF DOOR TO DOOR 
COLLECTORS 
THE STEREOTYPE OF A COLLECTORS BAILIFF IS NOT WHAT HIGH COURT 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE ABOUT WE 
ARE OFFICERS OF THE COURT AND WE 
ARE APPOINTED BY THE LORD 
CHANCELLOR THEREFORE I WANT TO 
MAKE A DISTINCTION IN THE PUBLIC'S 
MIND ABOUT WHEN THEY HAVE ONE OF MY 
OFFICERS ON THE DOORSTEP AS 
OPPOSED TO ANY THE FOURTH AND FORCE 
AND OFFICER 
THEY WORK FOR 
COMPANIES WHOSE BUSINESS REVOLVES 
AROUND COLLECTING PAYMENTS 
ACCOUNTANTS BANKS AND UTILITY 
COMPANIES ALTHOUGH WORK COMES FROM 
THE HIGH COURT THE MINIMUM THEY 
COLLECT A SIX HUNDRED CASES THROUGH THE 
HIGH COURT OF QUICKER THAN THE 
COUNTY COURT NO WARNING LETTERS 
NEED TO BE SENT 
WE WILL REMOVE 
MORE THAN ONE DISH VEHICLE 
TRACEY RUNS THE OPERATIONAL SUPPORT 
TEAM AND MANAGES THE WORK OF EIGHTY 
OFFICERS ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES 
AND COULD BE LOOKING UP TO THIRTEEN HUNDRED 
JOBS AT ANY TIME THE OFFICERS NEED 
TO BE VERSATILE SOME CAN SAIL AND 
DRIVE TRAINS 
WE HAVE DONE 
AEROPLANES WHERE WE HAVE GOT 
OFFICERS IN THE FIELD AND THEN WE 
HAVE HAD TO HAD A CLIENT PHONE UP 
AND SAY THAT AEROPLANE WILL BE 
LANDING AND THEN IT WILL BE TAKEN 
OFF WITHIN THREE HOURS WE HAVE HAD 
TO GET OFFICERS OUT OF THE FIELD 
TO THE AIRFIELD THEY HAVE HAD TO 
PICK UP THE WRIT AND THEN SEES AEROPLANE 
THE COMPANY ALSO USES AEROPLANE ITS ENFORCEMENT POWERS TO CARRY OUT 
ADDICTIONS THEY HAVE SEEN A SIXTY FIVE PER CENT 
INCREASE IN POSSESSION ORDERS 
AGAINST PROPERTIES OVER THE LAST 
TWO YEARS THEY ALSO DO WORK ON 
PROTEST SITES SUCH AS SUPERMARKET 
DEVELOPMENTS AND POWER STATIONS 
THE CLIENT HAS TO GO TO COURT AND 
OBTAINED A POSSESSION ORDER THEN 
THEY APPROACH AN AGENCY LIKE 
OURSELVES AND SAY WE NEED THESE 
PEOPLE ARE EVICTING FROM THE SITE 
THAT COULD INVOLVE PROTESTERS BEING 
UP SHIMMIES AND WE HAVE TO SEND OUR 
TEAMS INTO THE SIDES TO RELEASE 
PEOPLE DOWN FROM THE CHIMNEYS THEY 
MAY WELL BE IN TREES AND WE HAVE TO 
TAKE THEM OUT OF THE TREES AS WELL 
BACK IN THE FIELD SUE AND GARY A 
FORMER BANK MANAGER AND LORRY 
DRIVER REACH THEIR FIRST TOUR OF 
THE DAY THERE IS NO ONE IN THE 
PROPERTY LOOKS LIKE IT HAS BEEN 
VACATED THEY ASKED NEIGHBOURS IF 
THEY KNEW THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED 
THERE IF A BAILIFF COMES TO YOUR 
DOOR THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO FORCE 
ENTRY BUT IF YOU LET THEM IN THEY 
HAVE THE RIGHT TO RETURN AT ANY 
TIME THEY WON'T TAKE ANY BASIC 
LIVING NEEDS SUCH AS BIRDS FRIDGES 
AND THEY SHOULDN'T TAKE ANY TOOLS 
NECESSARY FOR YOUR LINE OF WORK IF 
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER THEM TO 
PAY THE DEBTS YOU KNOW SHOW THEM 
PROOF FOR INSTANCE A BENEFIT BOOK 
OR DOCUMENTATION TO PROVE A 
MORTGAGE IS NOT IN YOUR NAME TRY 
TO DO WITH THE SITUATION IN ONE GO 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS CHARGE EVERY 
TIME THEY COME OUT AND IF YOU DO 
OWN MONEY THIS WILL BE ON YOUR 
BILL 
YOU MIGHT BE MET WITH ANGER BILL AND EMBARRASSMENT AND ALL THE 
NEGATIVE EMOTIONS AND THOUGHTS BUT 
WHEN YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED EYE 
CONTACT AND YOU ARE THERE TO HELP 
THEM AS WELL AS TRIED TO COLLECT 
THE DEBT PEOPLE CAN'T DOWN AND 
DECIDE WE ARE NOT THAT BAD AFTER 
ALL AND THEY WILL TALK TO US WE 
GET A TRUE PICTURE OF THEIR 
SITUATION 
WHEN YOU SAY YOU ARE SITUATION THERE TO HELP THEM DO YOU GET ANY 
POSITIVE FEEDBACK 
YES THEY SHAKE 
YOUR HAND IN THE END THEY BURY 
THEIR HEAD AND DON'T KNOW WHAT TO 
DO WHEN YOU EXPLAIN TO THEM THEY 
SHAKE YOUR HAND AT THE END OF IT 
THE SECOND CALL OF THE DAY IS AN 
UNPAID WATER BILL OF AROUND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED 
THEY ARE INVITED IN 
HE JUST 
DISCUSSED HIS CIRCUMSTANCES WITH US 
SHE IS NOT IN A GOOD POSITION IN 
LIFE WE HAVE TAKEN AWAY AN OFFER 
OF REPAYMENTS BACK FOR THE 
CLAIMANTS TO DECIDE IF THEY ARE 
GOING TO ACCEPT IT DIFFICULT DIFFICULT SITUATIONS ON DAY TO DAY BUSINESS 
FOR ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS BUT 
CLAIRE IS DETERMINED HER TEAM DO 
NOT MAKE LIFE ANY WORSE THAN IT 
PASTA BEFORE THE PEOPLE THEY CALL 
ON 
WE PHOTOGRAPH THEIR SITUATION ON WHERE THEY HAVE NOTHING OF VERY 
LITTLE TOO IT HELPS US MAKE IT 
CLEAR FOR THE CREDITOR THAT THIS IS 
A WASTED CASE THIS IS NOT WORTH 
PURSUING SOME CREDITORS NEED THAT 
EXPLICIT PICTURE TO SHOW THEM THAT 
THIS DEBTOR HAS NOTHING L. L. FIT MANY 
CREDITORS THING DEBTORS ARE LIVING 
IN YOU KNOW WELL STOCKED WELL 
EQUIPPED HOMES AND HAVE BUSINESSES 
AND THERE MUST BE MONEY SOMEWHERE 
FOR MANY PEOPLE THAT ISN'T THE 
CASE 
SHARE GROUP ARE TRYING TO CASE MAKE INROADS ARE THE PEOPLE THEY 
CALL ON AS WELL AS THEIR CLIENTS 
APPRECIATE THEIR SERVICES IT IS A 
DIFFICULT PATH BUT AS THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH SQUEEZES THE U. K. ECONOMY ONE 
THAT MINUS ONE THAT MAY NOT TO BE 
PROGRESSIVE BUT NECESSARY 
WE ASKED FOR ALL MATTERS THAT WERE 
CONCERNING YOU ABOUT HOLIDAYS HAVE 
A LOOK AT THIS MAN SIMON CALDER 
TRAVEL EDITOR AT THE INDEPENDENT L. 
SPEAK FOR ME AND THE OTHER VIEWER 
WHEN I SEE YOU I ALWAYS FEEL 
HAPPIER I DO NOT KNOW WHY BUT YOU 
CHEER ME UP 
I SPENT MY ENTIRE LIFE 
ON HOLIDAY PRETENDING TO WORK 
FIRST OF ALL WE WANTED TO ASK YOU 
ABOUT BRITISH AIRWAYS BECAUSE THE 
LATEST FUEL SURCHARGE COMES INTO 
FORCE TODAY HOW DOES IT APPLY TO 
FLIGHTS BOOKED FROM NOW AND CAN IT 
BE RETROSPECTIVE 
DON'T GET TO 
STEAMED UP OF OF THE FUEL SURCHARGE 
YES THEY HAVE ANNOUNCED AN 
INCREASE OF UP TO THIRTY ON A RETURN 
LONG HAUL FLIGHT IF YOU HAVE 
ALREADY BOOKED AND PAID FOR YOUR 
FLIGHT THEY WON'T BE COMING AFTER 
YOU FOR THE MONEY IF YOU HAVE NOT 
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH THE FUEL BILL 
IS I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH THEY 
SPEND ON THEIR UNIFORMS I WANT TO 
KNOW THE PRICE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
BRITISH AIRWAYS IF YOU CHARGE ME 
THREE HUNDRED THIRTY INSTEAD OF THREE HUNDRED THIRTY TO GET TO NEW 
YORK DON'T FRET OUR LOOK AT 
ANOTHER AIRLINE 
THIS LADY ASKS WHAT HAPPENS IF 
YOU'RE HER FLIGHT IS CANCELLED OR 
DELAYED BEFORE THE HOLIDAY FLIGHTS 
ON A EUROPEAN SHORT BREAK WERE 
SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED FROM DAYTIME 
TONIGHT TIME COMPLAINED BUT HAVE 
BEEN REFUSED COMPENSATION L. L. HAVE BEEN TOLD IT WILL COST SEVENTY TO GO TO ARBITRATION 
IT IS NOT WORTH ARBITRATION BOTHERING GOING TO ARBITRATION IT 
YOU READ THE SMALL PRINT AND 
EUROPEAN LEGISLATION YOU WILL SEE 
AIRLINES CAN CHANGE THEIR FLIGHTS 
ORIGINALLY IT TENDED TO BE MOSTLY 
THAT THEY WERE TAKING A GUESS THAT 
IN SIX MONTHS' TIME THEY WOULD BE 
ABLE TO GET A SLOT TO FLY FROM 
GATWICK TO MALAGA AT TEN A M. WHEN THE 
SLOTS ARE CARVED UP IT TURNS OUT 
THEY CAN ONLY GET ONE AT EIGHT P. M. SO 
YOUR FLIGHT GETS CHANGED NOW IT IS 
TO DO WITH THE PRICE OF FUEL IF 
THE AIRLINE HAS A LOOK AT THE 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE BOOKED ON IT THEY 
SAID THEY ARE NOT BOTHERING TAKING 
OFF IF THERE AREN'T ENOUGH PEOPLE 
ON IT THEY WILL CANCEL THE FLIGHT 
AND THEY ARE ENTITLED TO DO THAT 
TWO WEEKS AHEAD YOU CAN SAY I 
HAVE CAR HIRE BOOKED ALL SORTS OF 
THINGS I HAVE BOOKED MY TICKET ON 
THE TRAIN IT SOUNDS VERY HARSH 
BUT THE AIRLINE IS AT LIBERTY TO DO 
THAT 
THE ONLY WAY TO PROTECT THAT YOURSELF IS TO BUY A PACKAGE 
HOLIDAY 
YOU GET ALL SORTS OF HOLIDAY BONUSES IT IS IF YOU ARE SAYING TO 
THE TOUR OPERATOR I WANT TO 
TRANSFER ALL OF MY RISK FOR THIS 
HOLIDAY FROM ME TO YOU SO FROM THE 
MOMENT I GET TO THE AIRPORT UNTIL I 
GET HOME EVERYTHING IS UP TO YOU 
TOUR OPERATORS ARE ALLOWED TO 
CHANGE THEIR FLIGHTS AS WELL BUT 
IF THEY CHANGE IT THEY STILL HAVE 
TO MEET ME AT THE PLANE 
PETER WILL 
BE VISITING A GREEK ISLAND IN THE 
SUMMER HE WILL HIRE A CAR HE 
WANTS TO PAY WITH HIS VISA CARD 
SHOULD HE WAIT AND PAYING EUROS OR 
DO IT IN STERLING 
NO TAKE CASH 
EUROS THEY SAY MORE ABOUT YOU THAN 
CASH EVER CAN CREDIT CARDS EVER 
CAN YOU NEED A VISA CARD TO 
GUARANTEE THE BOOKING BUT WHEN YOU 
SETTLE THE BILL DO NOT PLAY WITH 
PAY WITH PLASTIC DEBIT CARDS ARE 
EVEN WORSE ON A TWENTY BILL YOU CAN 
OFTEN FIND THAT TWO IS TAKEN OFF BY 
THE BANK TO PROCESS THE PAYMENT 
THAT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF WHAT YOU 
WOULD BE TIPPING THE WAITER ALWAYS 
PAY IN CASH 
I AM GUESSING HIS CAR WILL BE ABOUT 
THREE HUNDRED WHERE WOULD YOU KEEP FIVE HUNDRED 
EUROS 
IN MY WALLET 
PEOPLE DON'T EUROS ALWAYS WANT TO DO THAT 
IT IS QUITE 
A SAFE WORLD HONESTLY TRUST ME 
THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD PEOPLE OUT 
THERE IF YOU HAVE DECENT TRAVEL 
INSURANCE THAT WILL COVER THE CASH 
ALWAYS CASH NOT LEAST BECAUSE YOU 
CAN LOCK INTO AN EXCELLENT RATE 
HERE BY SHOPPING AROUND AND THAT 
WILL BE BETTER THAN YOUR CARD 
COMPANY 
WE YOU ACCEPT THAT PEOPLE COMPANY LOOK AT YOU AS THE VOICE OF WISDOM 
THERE WILL BE HORSES FOR COURSES ON 
CARRYING CASH ABROAD 
YES AND IF 
YOU ARE GOING TO THE DODGY AREAS OF 
LATIN AMERICA YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO 
CARRY YOUR CASH BUT FOR TRIPS TO 
EUROPE JUST CARRY YOUR CASH AND 
RELAX RELAX WHY DO WE HAVE TO HAVE A SINGLE 
SUPPLEMENT ON SINGLE PEOPLE THE 
EXCESSIVE MINIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT CAN 
DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF THE 
HOLIDAY NEARLY DOUBLE THE COST FOR 
A SINGLE PERSON 
THE WHOLE OF THE MAINSTREAM TRAVEL 
BUSINESS IS BASED ON THE IDEA THAT 
TWO PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS GO AWAY 
TOGETHER 
THAT IS RUBBISH ISN'T IT TOGETHER IT IS NOW WE HAVE FRAGMENTATION 
GOING ON IN SOCIETY BUT IF THE 
TOUR OPERATORS SAY WE WILL CHARGE 
YOU HUGE SINGLE SUPPLEMENT SAY 
THANKS FOR MUCH BUT I WILL SORT 
EVERYTHING OUT MYSELF SORT IT OUT 
INDEPENDENTLY STAY IN YOUTH 
HOSTELS AND YOU WILL MEET LOTS OF

I AM GOING TO THE STATES NEXT CASH WEEK I WILL TAKE A BIT OF CASH 
WE DON'T OFTEN HEAR OF AN 
INTERNATIONAL FLOWER COULD JURY A 
BUT RACHEL WENT TO MEET ONE AND 
LEARNED THAT WHEN AN AVERAGE BILL 
RUNS TO ONE MILLION THE CUSTOMER IS 
RIGHT RIGHT WHAT IS TWENTY FIVE F. T. TALL MADE OF SILK 
PETALS AND FLOWERS AND HAS PRIDE OF 
PLACE IN COVENT GARDEN A PAIR OF 
GIANT PEACOCKS THIS CAME FROM THE 
MIND OF PRESTON BAILEY WRITER 
PARTY PLANNER AND INTERNATIONAL 
FLOWER COULD YOUR AREA 
I HELP 
PEOPLE REALISE THEIR DREAMS IN 
EVENTS 
HE HAS DESIGNED THESE EVENTS PIECES FOR COVENT GARDEN AS PART OF 
THEIR SPRING RENAISSANCE SEASON AND 
HAS A GLITTERING C. V. HAVING PARTY 
PLANNED AND FLOWER ARRANGER FOR 
OPRAH DONALD TRUMP PLYMOUTH HOE 
RAHMAN CATHERINE ZETA JONES AND 
LIZA MINNELLI 
I NEEDED A JOB HE 
WAS TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AGO A VERY GOOD 
FRIEND OF MINE AN INTERIOR 
DESIGNER SUGGESTED I DO WEEKLY 
FLOWERS FOR ONE OF HIS HIGH END 
LUXURY KLEIN'S THAT IS HOW I 
STARTED I AM AN EVENT DESIGNER AND 
REDESIGNED EVERYTHING TO DO WITH 
ENTERTAINING HOW THE FOOD IS 
PRESENTED WHAT THE MUSIC SHOULD BE 
LIGHT AND MOST IMPORTANT THE 
ENVIRONMENT THE BEAUTIFUL SETTING 
RECREATE FOR THEM ONE OF THE 
STRONGEST 
TOOLS IS FLOWERS THOSE THOSE TOOLS DON'T COME CHEAP ON AVERAGE 
ONE OF HIS EVENTS WILL COST YOU 
AROUND ONE MILLION ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR 
LIGHTING THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR FLOWERS 
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR INSURANCE ALMOST HALF 
A MILLION FOUR SET BUILDING AND 
FIFTY THOUSAND FOR ADDITIONAL STAFF AND A 
FIFTY THOUSAND CONTINGENCY FUND ON 
AVERAGE HE 
TWO EVENTS A MONTH 
BUT HOW DOES HE COPE WITH 
TEMPERAMENTAL CLIENTS AND FRAGILE 
FLOWERS 
THERE IS ONE THING FROM FLOWERS THE BEGINNING THAT WAS IMPORTANT 
AND THAT IS CUSTOMER SERVICE L. 
BELIEVE THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS 
RIGHT EVEN WHEN THEY ARE WRONG 
WHAT I TEND TO DO NOW IS I AM A 
LITTLE BIT MORE CAUTIOUS WITH THE 
CUSTOMERS I TAKE ON WHENEVER THEY 
COME IN IF I GET A DISCOMFORT IN 
THE PIT OF MY STOMACH I TRY NOT TO 
ENCOURAGE THAT JOB AND I HAVE WAYS 
I CAN USUALLY GET OUT OF IT 
USUALLY WITH THOSE FEELINGS I AM 
USUALLY RIGHT L. DON'T THINK 
EVERYONE IS ALWAYS RIGHT TO WORK 
WITH EVERYONE 
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE DO WHEN 
WE HAVE ANY JOB WE NORMALLY END UP 
ORDERING AT LEAST TWENTY PER CENT MORE OF WHAT 
WE REALLY ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO USE 
JUST FOR ANY EVENTUALITY OF EITHER 
THE ORDER DOESN'T COME IN RIGHT OR 
CERTAIN ELEMENTS THAT THEY'RE NOT 
STRONG ENOUGH SO WE HAVE TO THINK 
WAY AHEAD 
THE INSTALLATION IN 
COVENT GARDEN DOESN'T INCLUDE TOO 
MANY FRAGILE BLOSSOMS THE BIRDS 
ARE MADE FROM SILK PETALS BUT THEIR 
TAILS ARE GROWING SPRING FLOWERS 
WHICH SHOULD BLOOM THROUGHOUT THE 
MONTH THEY'RE HERE 
IT'S PART OF A 
LONGER PROGRAMME OF REGENERATION OF 
THE COVENT GARDEN AREA REALLY AS A 
BUSINESS WE ARE A MAJOR LANDLORD 
HERE WE WANT TO REINVIGORATE THE 
AREA IT'S GOT GOT FANTASTIC 
INTERNATIONAL RE WE GET INCREDIBLE 
NUMBER OF VISITORS EVERY YEAR WE 
WOULD LIKE TO GET LONDONERS TO 
START COMING BACK ON A REGULAR 
BASIS 
YOU ARE HOPING THESE WILL BASIS BRING THEM BACK IN HOW MUCH HAVE 
THEY COST AND IS IT WORTH WORTH IT 
THE PEACOCKS ARE PART OF THE STORY 
IF WE WANT TO TARGET A 
SOPHISTICATED SET OF LONDONERS BACK 
TO THE AREA WE NEED TO DO MORE 
BUT THE PEACOCKS THEMSELVES HAVE 
COST US AROUND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TO NINETY THOUSAND 
AS PART OF THIS EVENT I THINK THEY 
ARE REALLY WORTH THEIR WEIGHT IN 
GOLD 
IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS GOLD PRESTON WILL BE WORKING ON A NUMBER 
OF ROYAL WEDDINGS IN THE MIDDLE

LATER ON IN THE WEEK ANOTHER HOTEL 
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A GOOD 
SNAPSHOT OF WORLD TOURISM THE BIG 
ROLLS ROYCE A CHEAP CARRIER IN 
EASYJET AND BIG CARRIER IN BRITISH 
AIRWAYS 
A LOAD FACTOR IS HOW FULL AIRWAYS THE PLANE IS 
OR HOW EMPTY EASYJET EASYJET AS FAR AS I CAN ALWAYS SEE FLY 
THEIR PLANES FULLER THAN BRITISH 
AIRWAYS 
YES THEY DO LAST TIME IT AIRWAYS WAS FLYING ABOUT EIGHTY SEVEN PER CENT FULL ON 
AVERAGE WHICH IS GOOD 
DO YOU 
REMEMBER WHAT BRITISH AIRWAYS WAS 
NOT TOO BAD IT WAS ABOUT I THINK 
ABOUT SEVEN PER CENT BEHIND WHICH IS NOT BAD 
AND THEY HAVE MORE EXPENSIVE SEATS 
LOW COST CARRIER MUST FLY FULLER 
ROLLS ROYCE INTERESTING TO SEE 
WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE 
INDUSTRY IS GOING WELL WHAT WILL 
DEMAND BE LIKE IN TWO YEARS' TIME 
ON THE HOTELS INTERCONTINENTALS 
VERY INTERESTING ANNOUNCED A 
REFURBISHMENT PLAN CLEVERLY THE 
AMOUNT THEY'RE PUTTING IN IS TINY 
THE FRANCHISEEES PUTTING IN MORE 
MOST HILTON HOTELS ARE NOT OWNED BY 
THE HILTON IT'S OWNED BY SOMEBODY 
ELSE AND THEY RUN IT ON THEIR 
BEHALF 
IN THEIR CASE THEY'RE BEHALF PUTTING IN ABOUT ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER ROOM 
GLOBALLY THURSDAY THEN BUSY

CONFUSED WAS IT UNILEVER THIS WEEK 
TALKING ABOUT SPLITTING THE COMPANY 
INTO TO AND HAVING A COMPANY THAT 
HAD MARMITE AND A FEW OTHER BRANDS 
NO THAT DID COME UP UNILEVER HAVE 
NOT SAID MUCH ABOUT THIS THEY TEND 
TO RUN IT AND PLAY OFF THE PRODUCTS 
LET ME DRAG YOU BACK TO SOMETHING 
YOU SAID ABOUT ROYAL AND SUN 
ALLIANCE L. GET CONFLICTING STORIES 
WHEN I HEAR THE RESULTS FROM A LOT 
OF PENSION COMPANIES THEY SAY WE 
ARE SELLING MORE PENSIONS IT SEEMS 
TO BE DOING WELL WHEN I TUCK TO 
GUYS IN THE WHEN I TALK TO GUYS 
IN THE INDUSTRY THEY SAY THEY'RE 
MISSING AN OUTFLOW OF MONEY FROM 
FUNDS WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON WHAT'S 
GOING ON 
THE NEW PREMIUM WRITTEN 
I GUESS THAT'S SLOW SEEMS TO BE 
SLOWING ACROSS THE BUSINESS BUT 
NOT AS BAD AS PEOPLE FEARED THAT'S 
BEEN FINE THE OTHER SIDE WHAT 
HAPPENED WITH THE INSURANCE 
COMPANIES LAST YEAR WAS A GOOD RUN 
SUMMER FLOODS DIDN'T AFFECT MUCH 
SO LAST YEAR WAS A GOOD YEAR THEIR 
PROJECTING FORWARD THAT PREMIUMS 
WILL FALL A BIT IN TERMS OF YEAR ON 
YEAR GROWTH IT DEPENDS NOW ON THE 
BIG CLAIM COMING THROUGH 
ON FRIDAY 
CATTLES A MONDAY LENDER MOSTLY MOSTLY OPERATING INSIDE BRITAIN TO PEOPLE 
WHO CAN'T GET BANK LENDING THANK THANK YOU FOR COMING IN HAVE A LOVELY 
WEEKEND WEEKEND THANKS FOR COMING IN WHEN YOU HAVE 
BEEN FEELING A BIT JIP WE WILL 
TURN BACK TO WORDS OF HOLIDAY 
WISDOM FROM SIMON A COUPLE OF E. 
MAILS FROM JOHN AND NEIL WHO ARE 
WATCHING THEY BOTH SAY YOU MIGHT 
BE WRONG THIS BUSINESS OF CASH 
VERSUS TKEB BIT BOTH DEBIT THEY 
USE NATIONWIDE WHICH THEY SAY DOES 
NOT INCUR SURCHARGES ON EITHER CARD 
BOTH ARE RIGHT AND THANKS TO THEM 
NOR NOT NODDING OFF DURING THE LAST 
ITEM IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT 
THAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE 
PLASTIC YOU CONSIDER SOMEBODY LIKE 
NATIONWIDE ALSO THE POST OFFICE 
HAS A CREDIT CARD WHICH I 
UNDERSTAND DOESN'T HAVE THAT 
LOADING BUT THE THING IS EVEN WITH 
NATION EYED AND NATIONWIDE YOU 
ARE STILL NOT GOING TO KNOW WHAT 
RATE OF EXCHANGE YOU ARE GOING TO 
GET UNLESS YOU GO FOR THE OPTION OF 
O. K. I WILL HAVE THE TRANSACTION IN 
STERLING AND GENERALLY THAT GIVES 
YOU SLIGHTLY WORSE DEAL THAN JUST 
CHANGING IT AND WAITING FOR THE 
BILL TO COME IN BUT IF YOU WANT TO 
LOCK INTO A PARTICULAR RATE THEN 
AGAIN JUST GET YOUR EUROS IN 
ADVANCE L. KNOW WE HAVE HAD PEOPLE 
HECKLING AND SAYING WHAT ABOUT 
PICKPOCKETS IF YOU ARE GOING TO 
ROME TO PRAGUE TO BARCELONA YES 
WORLD CLASS PICKPOCKETS THERE AND 
YOU NEED TO WATCH OUT PRETTY MUCH 
EVERYWHERE ELSE YOU WILL BE FINE I I HAD MY POCKET PICKED IN MILAN 
NEVER MIND WHO CARES 
WHEN BOOKING A A FLIGHT IT'S FIFTY NINE 
WHEN I MOVE ON FUEL CHARGES 
BAGGAGE AT FIVE POINT NINE NINE I FINE THE FARE 
HAS SUDDENLY INCREASED WHEN YOU ADD 
THE EXTRAS TO EIGHTY TWO ADDING ON THE 
EXTRA IT'S BECOME ONE HUNDRED TEN PERPASSENGER 
EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD CHARGE HOW 
IS THIS JUSTIFIED 
LET'S SEE WHAT 
THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING SAYS 
IT'S SPENT ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF 
TRYING TO GET THE LOW COST AIRLINES 
TO COMPLY SO THAT THE PRICE YOU SEE 
ON THE WEBSITE IS THE PRICE THAT 
YOU CAN BUY THAT FLIGHT FOR THEY 
SAID WE HAVE DONE IT EXCEPT THEY 
HAVEN'T QUITE AND THAT MEANS IF 
YOU GO ON TO RYANAIR FOR INSTANCE 
YOU WILL SEE A FLIGHT FOR TWENTY NINE YOU 
CLICK ON IT AND SUDDENLY OVER 
TOWARDS THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE 
WEBSITE UP POPS SOMETHING SAYING 
ACTUALLY IT'S MORE LIKE FORTY BECAUSE 
WE ARE GOING TO ADD TAXES FEES AND 
CHARGES BUT WHAT JET TWO DOES 
PARTICULARLY I THINK IT'S ALONE AT 
THIS IT WILL ACTUALLY ALL THE WAY 
THROUGH TELL YOU WHAT THE TOTAL IS 
AND RIGHT AT THE END IT WILL SAY 
HERE IS OUR FUEL SURCHARGE L. SAID 
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY JUSTIFY THIS 
YOU KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE YOU 
HAVE TO QUOTE ALL THE NON INITIAL 
NONNEGOTIATABLE CHARGES THE THING 
IS LOTS OF THOSE CHARGES MOST OF 
THE ONES YOU MENTIONED ARE 
NEGOTIATABLE YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
BOOK YOUR SEATS IN ADVANCE AND TAKE 
LUGGAGE WITH RYANAIR YOU CAN CHECK 
IN ONLINE AND AVOID THE FEE FOR 
CHECKING IN AT THE DESK YOU HAVE 
TO BE CAREFUL THAT YOU ARE NOT 
PAYING FOR THINGS YOU DON'T WANT 
EASYJET THEY WILL AUTOMATICALLY ADD 
INSURANCE TO YOUR BOOKING UNLESS 
YOU ACTUALLY SAY NO THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH I HAVE AN ANNUAL TRAVEL POLICY 
I DON'T WANT IT I THINK IT WAS 
WITH THEM I NOTICED IF YOU MAKE A 
MISTAKE ONLINE AND IT RESETS IT IF 
YOU HAVE NOT MARKED INSURANCE IT 
RESETS IT SO YOU HAVE SO YOU HAVE 
TO CONSTANTLY CHECK THEY HAVEN'T 
ADDED THAT 
WHAT THE OFFICE OF FAIR 
TRADING WAS AFTER WAS TRANSPARENCY 
WHAT WE HAVE GOT IS CLOUDS AND 
CLOUDS OF FOG AND THAT IS THE WAY 
THE AIRLINES LIKE IT THEY WANT TO 
LEAD YOU IN WITH A LOW FARE AND 
BUILD IT UP ON WHAT'S CALLED 
ANCILLIARIES WHICH IS WHERE THEY 
MAKE ALL THEIR MONEY 
A GENERAL 
QUESTION YOU SAID YOU SPEND ALL 
YOUR TIME TRAVELLING HAVE YOU 
BECOME MORE ENVIRONMENTLY CONSCIOUS 
DO YOU FEEL GUILTY ABOUT 
TRAVELLING 
I TAKE ABOUT EIGHTY OR NINETY TRAVELLING FLIGHTS A YEAR SO YES I FEEL 
GUILTY ABOUT THAT HOWEVER I 
ALWAYS TAKE THEM IN THE CHEAPEST 
MOST BASIC ECONOMY CLASS LAST 
WEEKEND WE HAD EOS GOING BUST 
THAT'S ABOUT THE MOST DAMAGING WAY 
THAT YOU CAN FLY IF YOU ARE DOWN 
THE BACK A HEAVILY PACKED EASYJET 
PLANE THAT ON A NEW AIRBUS IS 
ABOUT THE LIGHTEST YOU CAN HAVE 
WHEN I GET TO THE PLACES I AM GOING 
TO I CATCH LOCAL BUSES AND TRAINS 
BICYCLE 
YOU ARE FAMOUS FOR FOR BICYCLE TAKING YOUR BIKE EVERYWHERE IT IT DOES NOT MAKE UP FOR TAKING EIGHTY 
FLIGHTS A YEAR 
A LOT OF PEOPLE 
TALK ABOUT OFFSETTING 
IT'S VERY 
VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE 
GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE 
IT'S ALL SMOKE AND MIRRORS WITH A 
LOT OF THESE SCHEMES ABTA HAS A 
GOOD SCHEME WHICH I HAVE CHECKED 
OUT REDUCE MY FOOTPRINT AND THAT'S 
WORTH CONSIDERING THERE IS A LOT 
OF PEOPLE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY
