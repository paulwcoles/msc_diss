SHANNON REMAINS IN THE CARE OF 
SOCIAL SERVICES 
B. T. HAS ADMITTED MONITORING THE 
ACTIVITIES OF EIGHTEEN THOUSAND INTERNET USERS 
WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT EXPERTS SAY 
IT WAS ILLEGAL THE INFORMATION 
COMMISSIONER IN IS INVESTIGATING 
THE TELECOMS COMPANY HAS TOLD 
BREAKFAST IT WAS TESTING TECHNOLOGY 
WHICH ALLOWED IT TO ADVERTISE TO 
POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS THAT 
INFORMATION GATHERED WAS NEVER USED 
WHETHER YOU ARE LOOKING UP DETAILS 
FOR YOUR NEXT HOLIDAY DESTINATION 
OR BRUISING FOR A RECIPE YOUR 
PREFERENCES AND INTEREST REVEAL AN 
ASTONISHING AMOUNT OF INFORMATION 
ABOUT YOU AND THAT INFORMATION 
COULD BE EXTREMELY VALUABLE FOR 
ADVERTISERS THE TECHNOLOGY THAT 
TURNS YOUR KICKS INTO HARD CASH HAS 
ALREADY BEEN TESTED BY MAJOR 
TELECOMS FIRMS THE TECHNOLOGY 
WORKS BY TRACKING YOUR INTERNET 
SEARCHES FOR EXAMPLE IF I DECIDED 
I WANT TO LOUZ SOME WEIGHT AND 
ENTERED WEIGHT LOSS INTO A SEARCH 
ENGINE THAT SEARCH WOULD BE 
INTERCEPTED BY THE ADVERTISING TOOL 
AND RELEVANT MARKETING CAMPAIGNS 
FROM DIFFERENT COMPANIES WOULD BE

WERE ALSO CARRIED OUT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IN A 
STATEMENT B. T. SAYS THE TEST WAS TO 
EXPERTS SAY WHETHER B. T. USE THE 
INFORMATION OR NOT THEY BROKE THE 
LAW 
IT SEEMS REALLY QUITE A CLEAR LAW CASE OF ILLEGAL INTEREXCEPTION OF 
THE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THEIR 
CUSTOMERS AND THE WEBSITES WHERE 
THEY ARE BRUISING 
THE INFORMATION 
COMMISSIONER IN IS NOW 
INVESTIGATING B. T.'S ACTIONS THE 
PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE HAVE BEEN TOLD 
THEY ARE ENTERING A NEW POLITICAL 
ERA FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 
INDEPENDENCE ZANU P. F. HAS LOST 
CONTROL OF PARLIAMENT THERE IS NO 
OFFICIAL RESULT IN THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION THE OPPOSITION M. D. C. SAY 
ITS LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI HAS 
WON T. B. B. C. IS BANNED FROM ZIMBABWE 
SO OUR CORRESPONDENT JOINS US FROM 
NEIGHBOURING SOUTH AFRICA IT TEEMS 
EXTRAORDINARY WE ARE FIVE DAYS ON 
IS IT CLEAR WHAT THE POLITICAL 
FUTURE IS YET IN ZIMBABWE 
I THINK 
IT IS BECOMING CLEARER NOW WE HAVE 
THOSE PARLIAMENTARY RESULTS IN ALL 
OF THEM IT IS OBVIOUS THAT NO 
PARTY WOULD WIN A MAJORITY IN THE 
FIRST ROUND OF A PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION IF THE RESULTS WERE TO BE 
THE SAME SO ROBERT MUGABE WOULD 
HAVE TO PUT HIMSELF THROUGH A 
SECOND ROUND MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE 
THAT HE WOULD NOT WIN A SECOND 
ROUND SO WHY WOULD HE PUT HIMSELF 
THROUGH THROUGH THAT HIEMLATION WE 
ARE SEEING AN ACKNOWLEDGE BY THE 
AUTHORITIES FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT 
SOMEONE OTHER THAN ZANU P. F. AND 
ROBERT MUGABE CAN LEAD ZIMBABWE

WHILE HOLDING ON TO HIS POSITION AS 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE THERE ARE RULES AS 
TO HOW COMPANIES ARE MEANT TO DO 
THIS AND THE RULES SAY THAT 
COMPANIES SHOULDN'T ALLOW THIS TO 
HAPPEN UNLESS THERE IS A GOOD 
REASON SOME BIG SHAREHOLDERS HAVE 
SPOKEN OUT IN THE TIMES AND IN 
OTHER PAPERS NEWS THAT MARKS AND AMP 
SPENCER IS TO MAKE A CONCESSION TO 
THE BIG SHAREHOLDERS STUART ROSE 
WILL HAVE TO PUT HIMSELF FORWARD 
FOR A VOTE EVERY YEAR TO BE RE 
ELECTED TO THE BOARD NO DIRECT 
VOTE ON WHETHER HE SHOULD STAY AS 
CHAIRMAN BUT THERE WILL BE A VOTE 
ON WHETHER HE SHOULD REMAIN A

LENDERS ARE SCRAPPING THEIR 
CHEAPEST HOME LOANS SOME MORE TO 
TELL YOU ABOUT TODAY THE CO OP IS

FALLEN BY ONE FIFTH IN THE LAST 
WEEK ALONE 
EUROPEAN GOES COMPANIES ARE GAS 
COMPANIES ARE PUSHING UP PRICE BY 
BUYING THEM IN THE SUMMER BUT NOT 
SELLING THEM BACK IN THE WINTER 
THE COMMENT COMES AS OFGEM LOOKS 
INTO WHETHER THE ENERGY MARKET IS 
OPERATING FAIRLY 
AS MANY AS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY BUILDING COMPANIES

INVESTIGATION INTO BID RIGGING THE 
FAIR TRADING WATCHDOG THE OFT HAS

IN THE MONTH OF MARCH IT IS 
THOUGHT THE TOTAL WILL BE AROUND 
TWO POINT FOUR MILLION PASSENGERS THAT'S UP 
JUST SLIGHTLY FROM FEBRUARY'S TOTAL 
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE PER PLANE 
THAT'S THE LOAD FACTOR THAT'S 
EXPECTED TO BE UNCHANGED 
WE GET NEWS TODAY FROM LLOYD'S OF 
LONDON AND FROM THE COMPANY 
HALFORDS 
YOU'RE WATCHING BREAKFAST 
THE BODY WHICH ADVISES MINISTER ON 
DRUGS POLICY HAS COME OUT AGAINST 
GORDON BROWN'S CALL TO TOUGHEN THE 
LAW ON CANNABIS 
WEST YORKSHIRE POLICE CHARGED THE 
STEPFATHER OF SHANNON MATTHEWS WITH 
POSSESSING INDECENT IMAGES OF 
CHILDREN CHILDREN COMING UP CHILDREN ARE BEING ASKED 
TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT PLAYGROUNDS 
SARAH CAMPBELL IS IN BRISTOL TO SEE 
WHY WHY YES INDEED OVER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION 
POUNDS HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO HELP IMPROVE 
PLAY AREAS SO HOW SHOULD THEY SPEND 
THE MONEY WELL I WILL BE ASKING 
THE EXPERTS 
A TERRIBLE RUMOUR THERE MIGHT BE 
SNOW THIS WEEKEND IT CAN'T BE TRUE 
SURELY NOT 
IT IS TRUE BILLYMENT IT WILL TURN 
COLDER WE'RE LOOKING AT WINNERY 
SHOWERS THERE WILL BE SNOW SLEET 
AND HAIL AND RAINMENT IT WILL BE 
DIFFERENT TO THE WEATHER WE'RE 
EXPERIENCING AT THE MOMENT WHICH IS 
MOSTLY DRY AND ALSO MILD FOR SOME 
OF US THERE COULD BE A TEN CELSIUS 
DROP IN TEMPERATURE NOW IF WE 
LOOK AT THE SATELLITE PICTURE YOU 
CAN SPLIT THE COUNTRY UP INTO THREE 
PARTS IN THE EAST IT IS CHILLY 
WITH SUNSHINE TO THE WEST SOME 
SOME MURK BUT SUNSHINE THE RAIN 
CONTINUING IN NORTHERN AND WESTERN 
SCOTLAND SCOTLAND THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND SEEING 
CLOUD BUT SUNNY BREAKS COMING INTO 
THE EAST WE RUN INTO THE REAM OF 
CLOUD TOWARDS THE SOUTH AND THAT 
CLOUD HERE AND THERE WILL BE 
PRODUCING DRIZZLE PATCHY LIGHT 
RAIN AND THEN AS WE SWING INTO THE 
SOUTH WEST THERE IS A FAIR BIT OF 
MIST CLOSE TO THE COASTS HILL FOG 
AROUND AND MURK AROUND THE COASTS 
OF THE WEST BUT NOT COLD TEN 
CELSIUS 
AND QUITE BIT OF CLOUD AND THAT MURK AROUND PARTS OF WALES 
NORTHERN IRELAND TOO SEEING A 
CLOUDY START TO THE DAY BUT AGAIN 
MOSTLY DRY 
SO THE WET WEATHER OR THE DAMP 
WEATHER IS GOING TO BE THROUGH THE 
NORTH WEST OF SCOTLAND THE NORTH 
WEST OF ENGLAND AND HEADING DOWN 
TOWARDS THE SUSSEX 
THE BEST BREAKS IN THE EAST OR THE 
WEST INLAND WILL SEE BREAKS CLOSE 
TO THE SOUTH COAST THERE WILL BE 
SEA BREEZES BUT MOVING INLAND IT 
WILL BE WARM 
THROUGH THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT 
QUITE A BIT OF MURK CLOSE TO THE TO 
THE COAST FOG THROUGH THE ENGLISH 
CHANNEL AND THE CHANGE COMING INTO 
THE NORTH WE WILL SEE RAIN ACROSS 
SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELANDMENT 
COOLER BEHIND THAT NOT AHEAD OF IT 
SO A MILD NIGHT FOR MANY OF US 
THROUGH TOMORROW THE RAIN BAND 
CONTINUES TO SINK SOUTH BEHIND IT 
BRIGHTER SKIES AHEAD OF IT A GOOD 
DEAL OF BRIGHTNESS AND CLOUD TOO 
OUR MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE IN LONDON 
TOMORROW SEVENTEEN CELSIUS 
BUT THE COLDER AIR WILL COME OUR 
WAY THROUGH THE WEEK TO ALL OF US 
BY SUNDAY AND THEN WE ARE AT RISK 
OF THE WINTRY WEATHER 
THE B. B. C. LEARNED THAT THE PRIME 
MINISTER HAS BEEN ADVISED BY THE 
COUNTRY'S LEADING DRUG EXPERTS TO 
KEEP CANNABIS AS CLASS C. DRUG 
IF GORDON BROWN DECIDES TO 
RECLASSIFY BAN BUSINESS TO CLASS B. 
HE WOULD BE REJECTING THEIR 
RECOMMENDATIONS RECOMMENDATIONS CLASS C. ISN'T REALLY ACTED UPON 
BUT CLASS B. IS MORE SERIOUS YES YES THEY ARE EMINENT PEOPLE A LOT OF 
RESPECT FOR THEM BUT THEY ARE NOT 
ALWAYS ON THE FRONT LINE THAT WE 
ARE WE ARE LOOKING AT CASES AND WE 
HEAR OF HUNDREDS OF CASES OF PEOPLE 
WHO TAKE HEAVY USE OF CANNABIS 
PARTICULARLY IN ITS STRONGER FORMS 
OF SKUNK AND THAT TRIGGERS SKY 
COTIC BREAKDOWN THEY BECOME MAD 
THEY BECOME OUT OF REALITY THEY 
GET HALLUCINATIONS PARANOIA AND 
FEELINGS OF FEAR SO WE BELIEVE 
THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUAL 
LIVES OF PEOPLE AND THE WRECKAGE OF 
THOSE LIVES YOU CAN'T GIVE A 
CONFUSED MESSAGE APPARENTLY THE 
LATEST RESULTS WERE THAT THERE ARE 
EIGHT HUNDRED NEW CASES OF OF SCHIZOPHRENIA 
WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE NOT BE CAUSED 
IF THE PERSON HADN'T SMOKED 
CANNABIS AND SMOKED HEAVILY 
WHAT WE ARE TOLD IS THAT THE 
COMMITTEE HAS BEEN LOOKING AT 
SIGNIFICANT NEW RESEARCH WHICH 
FOUND THAT THERE HAS NOT 
NECESSARILY BEEN A LINK BETWEEN 
CANNABIS AND RISING MENTAL ILLNESS 
OVER THE PAST TWENTY OR YEARS YES YES THAT'S BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT 
THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE TO SHOW 
THERE IS A LINK THERE HAS BEEN 
EVIDENCE FROM PROFESSOR MURRAY 
SAYING YOU MIGHT INCREASE YOUR 
CHANCES OF GETTING AN ILLNESS LIKE 
SCHIZOPHRENIA BECAUSE IT HAS AN 
EFFECT ON THE DEVELOP BRAIN WHAT 
YOU HAVE GOT TO LOOK AT HERE IS 
WHAT WE ARE BALANCING THINGS IT 
IS A TRICKY BALANCE SO THE ADVISORY 
COUNCIL AND THE GOVERNMENT ARE 
LOOKING AT A DELEGATE BALANCE WE 
BELIEVE WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH YET 
ABOUT THE DIRECT LINKS BETWEEN 
CANNABIS AND THE BRAIN PARTICULARLY 
THE DEVELOP BRAIN AND UNTIL WE DO 
KNOW THE LINKS WE CANNOT BE YOUNG 
PEOPLE ARE DICING WITH THEIR MINDS 
AND THEIR FUTURES AND IF YOU HAVE 
SEEN SOMEBODY WHO HAS TAKEN HEAVY 
CANNABIS AND GONE ON A TRIP OF OF 
WHICH THEY HAVE NEVER RETURNED AND 
YOU SEE THE DAMAGE TO THEM AND 
THEIR FAMILIES THEN I THINK YOU 
HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FROM THAT POINT 
OF VIEW 
MARJORIE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
YOU MIGHT THINK IT SHOULD BE 
CHILD'S PLAY BUT IT CAN BE 
DIFFICULT TO ENTICE CHILDREN AWAY 
FROM THE T. V.'S AND COMPUTERS INTO THE 
GREAT OUTDOORS 
SARAH CAMPBELL IS IN BRISTOL 
GOOD MORNING AM AT FONT HILL 
PRIMARY SCHOOL AND THESE GUYS DON'T 
NEED MUCH PERSUADING TO PLAY 
OUTSIDE BUT THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO 
BE THE CASE WITH A LOFT CHILDREN 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT PLAY IS IT 
HELPS CHILDREN TO BUILD 
RELATIONSHIPS AND PROBLEM SOLVE 
WHEN WE ARE FACING CHILDHOOD 
OBESITY EPIDEMIC IT IS FANTASTIC 
SOURCE OF EXERCISE THAT'S WHY IT 
IS SEEN AS IMPORTANT LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES HAVE A HUGE LOAD OF 
MONEY COMING TO THEM IT IS A CASE 
OF FINDING OUT HOW THEY CAN SPEND 
IT HOW THEY CAN PUT THE FUN BACK 
INTO PLAY 
IN SCHOOL THE PUPILS NEED LITTLE 
ENCOURAGEMENT TO LET THEMSELVES GO 
AFTER SCHOOL IN COMMON WITH 
CHILDREN ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEY 
ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE ON THE 
COMPUTER THAN RUNNING AROUND 
OUTSIDE OUTSIDE THERE IS A LACK OF GOOD QUALITY 
ACCESSIBLE LOCAL PLAY FACILITIES 
PART OF IT IS DOWN TO PERHAPS 
PARENTS PERCEPTIONS OF THE SOCIETY 
NOT BEING SAFE AND ACTUALLY YOU 
HAVE GOT TO SAY IT IS FUN SITTING 
DOWN WITH A NINTENDO SOMETIMES 
THERE IS POT OF OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION 
AVAILABLE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO 
SPEND ON IMPROVING PLAY FACILITIES 
AND IT IS HOPED THAT OVER THE NEXT 
THREE MONTHS EVERYONE FROM PLANNERS 
TO PARENTS TO CHILDREN WILL ADVICE 
ON HOW THAT MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT 
WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PLAY AREAS BRISTOL IS 
SEEN AS ONE OF THE LEADING LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES WHEN IT COMES TO 
PROVIDING PLAY SPACES AND IT SAYS 
CONSULTING THEIR YOUNG CONSUMERS IS 
THE KEY TO SUCCESS 
AT EVERY LOCATION WE DEVELOP WE 
TALK TO CHILDREN THEY ARE THE KEY 
PLAYERS WE ASK THEM THE TYPE OF 
EXPERIENCES THEY WANT AS CHILDREN 
TO BE THERE DO YOU WANT TO SPIN 
DO YOU WANT TO BE UP HIGH WHAT DO 
YOU WANT TO DO WE BUILD FROM WHAT 
THEY TELL US 
THESE CHILDREN ARE OLD HANDS WHEN

CONSULTATION ALL IDEAS WILL BE 
CONSIDERED CONSIDERED WHAT FANTASTIC IDEAS FROM THE 
PUPILS AT FONT HILL PRIMARY SCHOOL

CHILD FRIENDLY BECAUSE IT IS 
DIFFICULT FOR SOME OF THEM WHEN 
THEY WANT TO GO OUT AND PLAY WE

WIN THE GAME AND LIVERPOOL CREATED 
VERY LITTLE TONIGHT

GOOD POSITION WE WITH ANFIELD

TROUBLE TROUBLE HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU KNEW THAT 
THE SITES YOU VISITED ON THE 
INTERNET WERE MONITORED BY YOUR 
SERVICE PROVIDER WOULD YOUR 
CONSENT THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO 
THOUSANDS OF B. T. CUSTOMERS EMMA 
SANDERSON IS IN CHARGE OF THE 
PROJECT AT B. T. GOOD MORNING TO YOU 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US YOU WERE 
SPYING ON YOUR CUSTOMERS THEY 
DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE DOING IT YOU 
HAVE LET THEM DOWN 
WE WERE NOT 
SPYING ON OUR CUSTOMERS B. T. 
CONDUCTED A TEST OF A NEW 
ADVERTISING SERVICE WITH A VERY 
SMALL PROPORTION OF OUR CUSTOMER 
BASE THOSE CUSTOMERS WERE RANDOMLY 
SELECTED AT THE TIME IT WAS 
COMPLETELY ANOM NOUS NO PERSONAL 
IDENTIFYABLE INFORMATION WAS SHARED 
NO INFORMATION WAS SHARED OR 
DIVULGED 
WERE YOU OR WEREN'T YOU DIVULGED WATCHING WHAT THEY WERE DOING ON 
LINE 
WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT IS LINE HOW WE CAN OFFER CONSUMERS MORE 
RELEVANT ADVERTISING 
SO YOU WERE 
LOOKING AT WHAT THEY WERE BUYING 
WE WERE NOT LOOKING AT WHAT THEY 
WERE BUYING NO WHAT WE ARE 
LOOKING AT IS TECHNOLOGY HERE 
THAT ENABLES US TO PRESENT 
CONSUMERS BASED ON THEIR BROWSING 
BEHAVIOUR IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT 
HOLIDAYS WE MAY PRESENT YOU WITH A 
TRAVEL ADVERTISEMENT WE RESEARCHED 
THIS WITH CONSUMERS THE OTHER 
BENEFIT 
IT DOES NOT GET AWAY BENEFIT FROM THE FACT THEY WERE BROWSING 
AS YOU WERE SAYING AND YOU WERE 
WATCHING WHAT THEY WERE DOING AS AS WE SAID WE CONDUCTED THESE TWO 
TESTS WITH A SMALL PROPORTION OF 
CUSTOMERS IT WAS ANONYMOUS NO 
INFORMATION WAS DIVULGED IT IS AN 
INNOVATIVE NEW SERVICE WE WILL 
HOPEFULLY TRAIL WITH SERVICE 
CUSTOMERS 
IT IS ALSO ILLEGAL YOU CUSTOMERS ARE NOT MEANT TO WATCH WHAT PEOPLE 
ARE DOING 
WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS 
ILLEGAL WE HAVE CONDUCTED OR 
SOUGHT ADVICE INTERNALLY AND 
EXTERNALLY AND PRIOR TO CONDUCTING 
THIS TRIAL IT IS NOT ILLEGAL 
THERE ARE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON 
THIS CLEARLY 
EVEN IF YOU ARE 
SAYING IT IS NOT ILLEGAL CUSTOMERS 
WHO WITH WATCHING US NOW WILL THINK 
HANG ON I TRUST THIS COMPANY I USE 
THIS COMPANYEN AND THEY ARE 
MONITORING THEY ARE WATCHING WHAT 
I AM DOING THEY WILL NOT BE HAPPY 
CUSTOMERS CAN TRUST B. T. L. AM HERE 
TO REASSURE THEM THIS IS SERVICE 
LOOKING TO PROVIDE THEM WITH AN 
IMPROVED BROWSING EXPERIENCE 
BETTER MORE RELEVANT ADVERTISING 
AND A SAVER ON LINE EXPERIENCE ONE 
OF THE BENEFITS IS WE CAN PROTECT 
THEM AGAINST ON LINE FISHING YOU YOU HAVE LET YOUR CUSTOMERS DOWN THEY 
DO NOT SIGN UP FOR YOU TO BE MON 
TOWING THEM DO THEY 
WE HAVE NOT 
LET OUR CUSTOMERS DOWN WE HAVE 
DONE A TECHNICAL TEST WITH A SMALL 
NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS 
SO PEOPLE OUT 
THERE NOW WATCHING IF YOU HAVE 
BEEN LOOKING AT THEM BEEN DOING 
TECHNICAL TEST HOW DO THEY FIND 
OUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE SUBJECT 
TO IT 
THE TEST OF THIS SERVICE WAS 
ANONYMOUS 
SO THEY DON'T KNOW MOST ANONYMOUS MOST CUSTOMERS IT WAS INVISIBLE TO THEM 
ONE OF THE REASONS WE TESTED THIS 
WAS TO CHECK IT DID NOT IMPACT ON 
THEIR EXPERIENCE IT WAS ANONYMOUS 
WE CANNOT TELL CUSTOMERS WE DO NOT 
KNOW WHETHER THEY WERE 
PARTICIPATING IN THE TRAIL OR NOT 
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY RESPITE I I THINK IT SHOULD REASSURE THEM WE 
ARE SAYING IT WAS COMPLETELY ANOM 
NOUS WE ARE PLANNING A TRAIL OF 
THIS SERVICE AGAIN PROBABLY LATER 
THIS MONTH IT WILL BE COMPLETELY 
OPTIONAL WE ARE NOT FORCING THIS 
ON CUSTOMERS CUSTOMERS WHO ARE 
INTERESTED WILL HAVE A CHOICE ABOUT 
WHETHER THEY TAKE IT OR NOT 
IS IT 
GOING ON AT THE MOMENT 
NO WE ARE 
NOT CONDUCTING ANY TRIALS AT THE 
MOMENT WE PLAN ONE WITH TEN THOUSAND 
USERS LATER THIS MONTH CONSUMERS 
WILL BESIDE WHETHER THEY WANT TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THAT TRIAL OR NOT 
I AM SURE PEOPLE WILL E. MAIL 
US.LET'S CATCH ONE THE WEATHER 
HERE IS CAROL 
A CHILLY START IN THE EAST 
ELSEWHERE IT IS NOT PARTICULARLY 
THE FORECAST FOR TODAY IS MOSTLY 
DRY ONE AND REMAINING MILD BUT 
THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE AS WE HEAD 
TOWARDS THE WEEKEND IT WILL TURN 
MUCH COLDER MORE ON THAT IN A JIFY 
ON THE SATELLITE PICTURE YOU CAN 
SEE HOW THE COUNTRY IS MORE OR LESS 
DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS THE EAST 
CHILLY BUT SUNSHINE TO COME A 
FINGER OF CLOUD EXTENDING FROM 
SCOTLAND DOWN THROUGH HAMPSHIRE 
INTO SUSSEX THAT IS PRODUCING SOME 
PARTICIPATION BY NINE HUNDRED A M. WE WILL 
HAVE RAIN ACROSS THE NORTH AND WEST 
OF SCOTLAND TO THE EAST SOME 
BREAKS AND SOME SUNSHINE EAST OF 
ENGLAND ALSO SEEING SUNSHINE THE 
NORTH WEST HAS THICKER CLOUD 
PRODUCING SOME OF THE DRIZZLE AND 
RAIN THAT EXTENDS DOWN INTO SUSSEX 
AND HAMPSHIRE AS WELL THERE IS 
ENOUGH CLOUD FOR YOU TO NOTICE THAT 
INTO THE SOUTH WEST HERE SOME 
BREAK LOW CLOUD AROUND HILL FOG 
AND COASTAL MIST AS WELL FOR WALES 
A SIMILAR STORY 
SOME BREAKS INLAND FOR NORTHERN 
IRELAND CLOUDY START TO THE DAY 
BUT BY NO MEANS COLD AT NINE 
CELSIUS AT NINE A M. THROUGH THE REST OF 
THE DAY GOOD BREAKS IN THE EAST IN 
THE WEST SOME MURK AROUND AND SOME 
SEA BREEZES ALONG THE SOUTH COAST 
INLAND WHERE THE CLOUD BREAKS AND 
WE HAVE SUNSHINE TEMPERATURES SIXTEEN TO SEVENTEEN 
CELSIUS MAYBE MORE THAN THAT FOR 
SOME OF US THROUGH THE COURSE OF 
THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT WE WILL 
HAVE SOME FOG AROUND ESPECIALLY SO 
IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL WHERE YOU 
CAN SEE THE NEXT BAND OF RAIN OVER 
SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND THAT 
IS HERALDING A BIT OF A CHANGE 
COLDER AIR BEHIND IT MILD AHEAD OF 
IT OVERNIGHT SO TOMORROW IF WE 
FOLLOW THAT RAIN BAND IT SINKS 
SOUTHWARDS SUNSHINE BEHIND 
SUNSHINE AHEAD OF IT AS WELL AS A 
BIT OF CLOUD OUR MAXIMUM 
TEMPERATURE SEVENTEEN CELSIUS THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND MUCH COLDER WITH SNE TO 
HIGHER GROUND TO SCOTLAND EVEN TO 
LOWER GROUND ACROSS SCOTLAND IT 
WILL NOT LAST BECAUSE OF THE 
SUNSHINE FOR THE REST OF THE 
BRITISH ISLES WINTRY SHOWERS WHICH 
MEAN SLEET SNOW AND HAIL 
IF YOU SAW SOMEONE COLLAPSE WOULD 
YOU RUSH TO GIVE THEM THE KISS OF 
LIFE LIFE DOES MOUTH TO MOUTH RESUSCITATION 
HAVE PLACE IN FIRST AID 
PETER I KNOW YOU HAVE HAD PERSONAL 
EXPERIENCE OF GETTING INVOLVED IN 
THIS LET'S START WITH GERRY THIS 
IS CONFUSING THIS IS FROM THE 
AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION YES YES THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION 
RELEASED A STATEMENT ON MONDAY 
SUGGESTING THAT UNDER CERTAIN 
CIRCUMSTANCES SO CALLED COMPRESSION 
ONLY OR HANDS ONLY C. P. R. MAYBE AS 
EFFECTIVE AS CONVENTIONAL C. P. R. 
UNDER WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES 
THE MOST 
THING IT WOULD BE SOMEBODY WHO WAS 
AN ADULT THAT IT WAS A WITNESS TO 
SUDDEN COLLAPSE AND THEREFORE 
PROBABLY CAUSED BY A PRIMARY HEART 
PROBLEM THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
IT IS PROBABLY ONLY GOING TO BE AS 
EFFECTIVE AS CONVENTIONAL C. P. R. FOR A 
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME PROBABLY ONLY 
THREE OR FOUR MINUTES AT MOST 
O. K. O. K. AND THEREIN LIES THE PROBLEM YOU 
ARE RELYING ON AN AMBULANCE SERVICE 
ARRIVING IN SHORT SPACE OF TIME 
TO RRY ON THE RESUSCITATION 
PETER YOU HAVE ACTUALLY USED THE 
KISS OF LIFE AND SAVED SOMEBODY'S 
LIFE LIFE YES YES WHAT HAPPENED 
A GENTLEMAN 
COLLAPSED IN THE STREET NEAR WORK 
AND SOMEBODY KNEW I WAS A TRAINED 
RESPONDER I WENT TO THE SCENE AND 
THERE WERE TWO FIRST AIDERS ON SITE 
ALREADY WHO HAD THE GENTLEMAN IN 
THE RECOVERY POSITION L. SAW YOUR 
LAST BREATHS COMING OUT AND THE 
LIPS WERE GOING BLUE L. ASKED THE 
FIRS AIDER TO TO PROVIDE THE MOUTH 
TO MOUTH BREATHS AND I PROVIDED THE 
CHEST COMPRESSIONS AND I CARRIED ON 
C. P. R. AND MANAGED TO SHOCK THE 
GENTLEMAN BACK TO LIFE 
I AM CONFUSED WHEN I SHUT BE GIVING 
MOUTH TO MOUTH 
IF YOU HAVE BEEN 
TRAINED IN C. P. R. AND YOU KNOW HOW TO 
DO MOUTH TO MOUTH VENTILATION OR 
THE KISS OF LIFE YOU SHOULD 
CONTINUE TO DELIVER CONVENTIONAL 
C. P. R. TO ANYONE WHO COLLAPSES AND YOU 
BELIEVE IS IN CARDIAC ARREST IF 
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN TRAINED OR 
UNHAPPY ABOUT DOING THE KISS OF 
LIFE BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 
CONCERNED AT THE PROSPECTS OF DOING 
THAT YOU SHOULD DO CHEST COME 
PRESSIONS ONLY BECAUSE SOME C. P. R. IS 
BETTER THAN NO C. P. R. 
CAN YOU DAMAGE PEOPLE BY GIVING 
THEM MOUTH TO MOUTH RESUSCITATION 
YOU WILL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DAMAGE 
THEM BY DOING MOUTH TO MOUTH 
RESUSCITATION THE ONLY THING IS 
THE TIME YOU ARE TAKE TO GO DO THAT 
YOU ARE NOT COMPRESSING ON THE 
CHEST IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO 
CONVENTIONAL C. P. R. YOU NEED TO 
MINIMISE THE INTERRUPTION TO THE 
COME PRESSIONS COMPRESSIONS 
PETER YOU GAVE HIM THE KISS OF 
LIFE AND WITH THAT YOU SAVED HIM AS 
WELL HE WOULD HAVE GOT BRAIN 
DAMAGE IF HE HADN'T 
THE BRAIN WILL 
SHUT DOWN WITHIN THREE OR FOUR 
MINUTES WITHOUT WITHOUT OXYGEN HE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN BRAIN DAMAGED 
ARE YOU GOING TO SHOW US THEN 
I WILL SHOW THE COMPRESSIONS AND 
THE KISS OF LIFE THE KEY THING IS 
TO TO ESTABLISH THAT SOMEBODY IS 
NOT BREATHING PROPERLY AND CALL THE 
AMBULANCE SERVICE 
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX 
SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN 
TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN 
THIRTY COMPRESSIONS AND THEN ONE TWO 
MOUTH TO MOUTH VENTILATIONS AND 
BACK TO ZERO COMPRESSIONS THIRTY 
COMPRESSIONS TO TWO MOUTH TO MOUTH 
VENTILATIONS AND KEEP GOING UNTIL 
THE AMBULANCE SERVICE ARRIVES 
WHEN I WAS TRAIN IT WAS FIVE OR SIX 
AND THEN ONE BREATH 
THE EMPHASIS HAS SHIFTED TO MORE 
COMPRESSIONS COMPRESSIONS THANK YOU 
WE WILL TALK TO YOU LATER AT EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY 
IF VIEWERS WANT TO SEE THAT AGAIN 
THIS IS BREAKFAST 
THE BODY WHICH ADVISES MINISTER ON 
DRUGS POLICY APPEARS TO HAVE COME 
OUT AGAINST GORDON BROWN'S CALLS TO 
TOUGHEN THE LAW ON CANNABIS 
WEST YORKSHIRE POLICE HAVE CHARGED 
THE STEPFATHER OF SHANNON MATTHEWS 
WITH POSSESSING INDECENT IMAGES FOR 
CHILDREN MARK ADDY WILL BE HERE TO 
TELL US ABOUT HIS LATEST ADVENTURE 
AND HE IS PROBABLY KEEPING HIS KIT 
ON I THINK 
YOU CAN NEVER BE SURE ON THIS 
PROGRAMME PROGRAMME HERE IS DECLAN 
BILL I AM GLAD YOU ASKED THAT 
WHEN WE DID FIRST AID CLASSES AT 
SCHOOL AND THAT WASN'T LONG AGO IT 
WAS FIVE AND THEN BREATHE SO IT 
CHANGED CHANGED IT HAS MODIFIED YES 
INTERESTING STUFF 
THERE IS LOT OF GRIM STUFF IN 
YOUR NEWSPAPERS THIS MORNING ABOUT 
THE STATE OF THE MORTGAGE MARKET 
PARTICULARLY THIS HEADLINE IN THE 
DAILY MAIL TODAY NEGATIVE EQUITY 
THREAT TO THREE MILLION HOMES 
THE BACK STORY TO THIS IS THAT IT 
IS JUST BECOMING MORE AND MORE 
EXPENSIVE TO TAKE OUT A MORTGAGE A 
GROWING NUMBER OF MORTGAGE LENDERS 
HAVE SCRAPPED THEIR CHEAPEST 
AVAILABLE DEALS BECAUSE THEY SAY 
THEY ARE BEING SWAMPED BY DEMAND 
FROM HOME OWNERS WE HAVE ONE OF 
THE DIRECTORS OF THE HALIFAX 
WARNING THAT MORTGAGE COSTS ARE 
GOING TO RISE 
WE HAD FIGURES YESTERDAY WHICH 
SHOWED A FALL IN THE NUMBER OF NEW 
MORTGAGES BEING ISSUED SUE 
ANDERSON IS WITH ME FROM THE 
COUNCIL OF MORTGAGE LENDERS 
I AM GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS 
STORY IN SECOND FIRST OF ALL 
THIS BUSINESS ABOUT BANKS AND 
BUILDING SOCIETIES WITHDRAWING THE 
CHEAPEST DEALS FIRST DIRECT WERE 
DOING IT AND THE CO OP HAS DONE IT 
ONE OF THE BIG AMERICAN MORTGAGE 
COMPANIES PULLED OUT OF BRITAIN 
THEY SAY IT IS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE 
REASONS ARE THEY TELLING THE 
TRUTH 
YES THEY ARE TELLING THE TRUTH TRUTH BUT THE BOTTOM LINE STORY TO 
THIS IS THAT INDIVIDUAL LENDERS ARE 
SUFFERING A SWAMP AN OVERLOAD OF 
APPLICATIONS FROM CONSUMERS BUT 
THE REASON THAT IS HAPPENING THERE 
IS LESS FUNNING IN THE MARKET 
OVERALL THAN THERE WOULD NORMALLY 
BE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE FUNDING 
ISSUES INDIVIDUAL LENDERS WOULDN'T 
FIND THEMSELVES WITH AN OVERSUPPLY 
OF DEMAND FROM CONSUMERS 
I I HEARD THIS NEWS FROM FIRST 
DIRECT AND MY THOUGHT WAS THEY MUST 
BE IN A POSITION WHERE THEY ARE NOT 
ABLE TO BORROW ENOUGH MONEY CHEAPLY 
ENOUGH TO FACE THE DEMAND IT IS 
NOT THAT IT IS NOT THAT THEY ARE 
NOT ABLE TO RAISE ALL THE MONEY 
THEY NEED 
NO EVERY INDIVIDUAL 
LENDER HAS A TARGET FOR HOW MUCH 
LENDING IT IS EXPECTING TO DO IF 
IT GETS ANICATIONS THAT ARE IN 
EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT OF LENDING IT 
EXPECTS TO DO IT CAN DO A NUMBER 
OF THINGS TO SLOW DOWN THE FLOW IT 
CAN CHANGE RATES AND IT COULD MAKE 
A TEMPORARY WITHDRAWAL FROM THE 
MARKET TO CLEAR THE BACKLOG OR 
AMEND TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND LEND 
TO FEWER PEOPLE 
THIS STORY IN THE MAIL NEGATIVE 
EQUITY THREAT TO HOMES THAT'S 
WHERE PEOPLE END UP WITH MORTGAGE 
THAT'S MORE THAN THE HOUSE 
THAT'S HIGH IT IS PREDICATED ON 
ASSUMING THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE HAVE LITTLE EQUITY IN THEIR 
HOMES ALREADY AND THAT HOUSE PRICES 
FALL BY A FAIRLY DRAMATIC AMOUNT OF 
TEN PER CENT I THINK IT IS A RATHER HIGH 
ESTIMATE I DON'T THINK ANYONE 
WOULD DISAGREE THAT FOR HOUSEHOLDS 
WITH LITTLE EQUITY IF PRICE FALLS 
HAPPEN THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO 
LOOK HARD AT THEIR FINANCES IT IS 
HIGH HIGH JTS THERE IS A RISK BUT IT IS NOT 
AS HIGH 
THANK YOU MORE AFTER SEVEN HUNDRED A M. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
FLESH FLOWERS ARE ALWAYS NICE WE 
SPEND TWO POINT FIVE BILLION ON THEM EVERY 
YEAR DEMAND FOR BRITISH BLOOMS HAS

ROCKETED THEIR BUSINESS WAS LOSING 
MONEY UNTIL SOME PASSING TOURISTS 
GAVE THEM FRESH IDEA 
WE WERE ASKED BY VISITORS TO THE 
ISLANDS COULD WE SEND FLOWERS BY 
POST SO YES WE COULD IT WAS 
SOMETHING WE WEREN'T GEARED UP FOR 
BUT WE DID START DOING THAT IN A 
SMALL WAY TO START WITH AND ONE OF 
THE PROBLEMS FOR US BY SENDING BY 
POST WAS THE FACT THAT WE ONLY HAD 
A PERSONAL SERVICE ON THE POSTAL 
SERVICE ON THE ISLANDS THREE DAYS A 
WEEK WEEK SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER WITH A MUCH 
IMPROVED POSTAL SERVICE AND A 
WEBSITE SENT FROM THE ISLANDS IS 
THRIVING EACH YEAR THEY SEND 
SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND BOXES PACKED WITH OVER TWENTY FIVE 
MILLION FLOWERS DIRECT TO THEIR 
CUSTOMERS CUSTOMERS WE ARE NOT GOING THROUGH THE 
WHOLESALE MARKETS THEREFORE WE 
CAN COMPETE AGAINST FLOWERS BEING 
FLOWN IN FROM KENYA WE DON'T HAVE 
A VERY LARGE CARBON FOOTPRINT AND 
PEOPLE ARE MORE AND MORE AWARE OF 
THAT THAT BY CUTTING OUT THE MIDDLE MAN AND 
MAKING THE MOST OF THEIR SCENTED 
FLOWER NICHE THE FUTURE IS LOOKING 
ROSY BUT IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT 
MONEY THERE ARE OVER FIFTY FLOWER 
FARMS ON THE ISLES OF SCILLY THE

HOLIDAY DESTINATION OR BROWSING FOR 
A RECIPE YOUR PREFERENCES AND 
INTERESTS REVEAL AN ASTONISHING 
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU 
THAT COULD BE EXTREMELY VALUABLE 
FOR ADVERTISERS THE TECHNOLOGY 
THAT TURNS YOUR CLICKS INTO HARD 
CASH IS ALREADY BEING TESTED BY 
MAJOR TELECOMS FIRMS THE 
TECHNOLOGY WORKS BY TRACKING YOUR 
INTERNET SEARCHES FOR EXAMPLE IF I 
DECIDED I WANT TO LOSE SOME WEIGHT

INVESTIGATING B. T.'S ACTIONS 
THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE HAVE BEEN 
TOLD THEY ARE ENTERING A NEW 
POLITICAL ERA FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SINCE INDEPENDENCE ZANU P. F. HAS 
LOST CONTROL OF THE COUNTRY'S 
PARLIAMENT ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO 
OFFICIAL RESULT IN THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION THE OPPOSITION M. D. C. SAYS 
ITS LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI HAS 
WON THE BOB IS BANNED FROM 
ZIMBABWE SO PETER GRESTE JOINS US 
NOW FROM MACHIPANDA WHICH IS ON 
THE COUNTRY'S BORDER WITH 
MOZAMBIQUE GOOD MORNING THE M. D. C. 
SOME REASON TO CELEBRATE HAVING 
TAKEN CONTROL OF PARLIAMENT REAL 
POWER LIES WITH THE PRESIDENTY AND 
STILL NO OFFICIAL RESULT FROM THAT 
ELECTION 
THAT IS RIGHT NO ELECTION OFFICIAL RESULT ALTHOUGH YOU SAID 
THIS IS A NEW ERA FOR ZIMBABWEANS 
ONE THING WHICH IS WORTH POINTING 
OUT IS ZIMBABWEANS ARE NOT 
CELEBRATING YET THE OPPOSITION MAY 
HAVE WON CONTROL OF PARLIAMENT BUT 
IT REALLY IS THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE 
WHICH COUNTS IN ALL OF THIS THERE 
HAS BEEN GOOD NEWS FOR THE 
OPPOSITION THE M. D. C. IS HAPPY ABOUT 
THE RESULTS SO FAR WE HAVE NOT 
SEEN PEOPLE ON THE STREETS THAT IS 
INDICATIVE OF THE FACT IT IS THE 
PRESIDENTIAL VOTE WHICH MATTERS THE 
MOST WE ARE EXPECTING THAT THERE 
MAY BE SOME OFFICIAL RESULTS LATER 
TODAY BUT THERE IS NOTHING SO FAR 
THE ONLY INDICATION THAT WE HAVE 
THAT MAYBE RELIABLE IS THE HERALD 
NEWSPAPER THE MAIN GOVERNMENT 
PAPER THE GOVERNMENT RUN PAPER 
WHICH IS A GOOD BAROMETER THE WAY 
THAT ZANU P. F. IS THINKS THAT IS 
TELLING US WE ARE HEADING FOR A RUN 
OFF BETWEEN ROBERT MUGABE AND 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
THANK YOU 
YOU CAN KEEP UP TO DATE WITH ALL 
THE NEWS WITH THE B. B. C. NEWS WEBSITE

A NETWORK OF NATURE RESERVES COULD 
BE ESTABLISHED IN THE SEAS AROUND 
BRITAIN THE MARINE BILL IS 
EXPECTED TO REGULATE FISHERIES 
SOME GROUPS SAY THE SEAS NEED 
TOUGHER PROTECTION 
IT 
IS LOOKING BEAUTIFUL THERE IT IT IS A BEAUTIFUL MORNING HERE OF 
COURSE HERE ON THE LAND WILD LIFE 
ENJOYS PROTECTION BUT OUT AT SEA 
IT IS DIFFERENT NO SUCH PROTECTION 
AT THE MOMENT BUT THE GOVERNMENT 
TELLS US IT PROPOSES TO CHANGE ALL 
OF THAT IT SAYS VAST AREAS OF THE 
SEA AROUND BRITAIN MAY BECOME 
NATURE RESERVES IT IS SUGGESTING A 
NETWORK OF MARINE CONSERVATION 
ZONES 
IT IS BEAUTIFUL AND ALL ZONES PART OF OUR NATURAL HERITAGE WHILE 
ON LAND THERE IS STRICT PROTECTION 
FOR WILDLIFE AND HABITAT IN THE 
SEA IT IS A DIFFERENT STORY UNTIL 
NOW JUST TWO PER CENT OF BRITISH WATERS 
WHICH ARE AMONG THE WORLD'S RICHEST 
MARINE ENVIRONMENT HAVE BEEN SET 
ASIDE AS PROTECTED AREAS TODAY THE 
GOVERNMENT WILL ANNOUNCE ITS MASTER 
PLAN TO SAFEGUARD OUR SEAS IT WILL 
CREATE A NETWORK OF MARINE 
CONSERVATION ZONES BY TWO HUNDRED ONE TWENTY PER CENT OF 
OUR TERRITORIAL WATERS WILL BE 
DEEMED PROTECTION ZONES 
CONSERVATIONISTS SAY ABOUT TIME 
THERE HAS BEEN SUCH A HOTCHPOTCH OF 
DIFFERENT BITS AND PIECES MOST WITH 
LITTLE POWER TOS TO BRING THEM ALL 
TOGETHER SO ONE PIECE IS NOT 
COUNTERING ANOTHER WILL BE 
BENEFICIAL 
STOPPING THE DAMAGE BENEFICIAL CAUSED BY TRAWLERS IN SOME 
SENSITIVE AND VULNERABLE AREAS IS 
AMONG THE AIMS OF THE MARINE BILL 
FISHERMEN LIKE DAVE KNOW THE 
PROPOSED NEW RULES MAY FURTHER 
LIMIT HIS FREEDOM TO FISH AT A 
TIME WHEN HE IS BATTLING QUOTA 
LIMITS AND STRICT REGULATION 
STILL HE GIVES THE MARINE BILL A 
CAUTIOUS WELCOME 
WE NEED TO BE 
INVOLVED IN THE DECISION MAKING 
PROCESS ABOUT WHERE THESE AREAS GO 
AND WHAT THEY ARE 
WHAT THE RULES 
ARE WHEN THEY ARE SET UP 
WHAT THE 
RULES ARE WHAT SORT OF FISHING WILL 
BE INVOLVED IN THERE AND WHAT WILL 
NOT BE ALLOWED 
TODAY'S'S BILL 
GIVES A BROAD BRUSH APPROACH ABOUT 
HOW BEST TO PROTECT OUR MARINE LIFE 
IT LEAVES OPEN HOW MUCH OF OUR SEAS 
SHOULD BE MADE CONSERVATION ZONES 
AND WHAT LEVEL OF PROTECTION THEY 
SHOULD HAVE THERE IS MORE GOOD 
NEWS IN THIS DRAFT BILL FOR PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNING FOR 
BETTER ACCESS TO COASTAL PATH WAYS 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT WILL OPEN UP 
THE ENTIRE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MILES OF COAST 
AROUND ENGLAND TO RAMBLERS T. RIGHT

SHIP 
AT THE PRESENT MOMENT IT IS SHIP EARLY IN THE MORNING AND THE 
PASSENGERS ARE JUST BEGINNING TO 
RISE AND LOOK OUT ON THE VISTA OF 
MA DERRA ONCE AGAIN THE SITUATION

LEGAL ARGUMENT BETWEEN THE 
RECEIVERS OF THE OLD TRAVEL SCOPE

THAT THIS SHIP HAS BEEN ARRESTED 
HERE AND THE PASSENGERS ARE BEING 
HELD AS HOSTAGES 
HOSTAGES WHAT IS

THE ROLLING STONES ROCKED INTO 
LEICESTER SQUARE LAST NIGHT FOR THE 
PREMIER OF THEIR FILM SHINE A LIGHT 
DIRECTED BY MARTIN SCORSESE THE 
DOCUMENTARY IS AN INCITE INTO THEIR 
FORTY SIX YEAR HISTORY 
IT WAS SO EASY 
YOU KNOW WORKING MARTIN SCORSESE 
WAS VERY VERY EASY HE SAID I WANT 
TO STAY OUT OF YOUR HAIR L. JUST 
WANT TO GET A SHOW L. SAID YOU CAN 
ONLY DO THAT IF WE DON'T KNOW YOU 
ARE THERE HE SAID I WILL 
GUARANTEE YOU WILL NOT KNOW WE ARE 
THERE AND THAT HE DID AND MARTIN 
ONE LOVE 
STAYING OUT OF KEITH 
RICHARDS'S HAIR NOT THAT 
DIFFICULT DIFFICULT IT IS A WEEK SINCE BAGGAGE CHAOS 
TURNED THE MUCH TOOTED LAUNCH OF 
TERMINAL FIVE INTO TURMOIL AT LEAST 
NINETEEN THOUSAND BAGS WERE MISLAID AS 
HUNDREDS OF FLIGHTS WERE CANCELLED 
NOW SUITCASES ARE BEING SENT TO 
ITALY B. A. PROMISING NINETY TWO PER CENT OF 
SCHEDULED FLIGHTS WILL GO TODAY 
OUR REPORTER IS HERE WITH ALL THE 
LATEST A WEEK ON AND THEY ARE 
STILL TRYING 
A WEEK ON AND B. A. HAS 
FIVE SEPARATE SYSTEMS IN PLACE YOU 
MENTION THE LORRIES ON THE WAY TO 
MILAN T. SPECIALIST CENTRE MORE 
LORRYS TO SCOTLAND MANCHESTER 
THEY ARE TRYING TO SORT IT OUT AT 
HEATHROW AND GATWICK THEY ARE FED 
EXING SOME PEOPLE'S LUGGAGE OUT TO 
THE STATES B. A. ARE CONCENTRATING ON 
PASSENGERS SAYING YOU HAVE TO TELL 
US WHERE YOU ARE OTHERWISE YOU MAY 
NOT GET YOUR LUGGAGE BACK THEY ARE 
CONCENTRATING ON WHAT IS A 
LOGISTICAL NIGHTMARE FOR THEM YOU 
CANNOT HELP BUT FEEL THEY ARE 
BECOMING LIKE MOST AIRLINES 
SLIGHTLY INURED TO ALL THE PERSONAL 
ISSUES THE ANXIETY THE HASSLE AND 
THE REAL DISTRESS THAT SOME PEOPLE 
ARE SUFFERING 
IF YOU WERE PLANNING 
A TROPICAL ISLAND WEDDING WHAT 
WHICH WHICH WOULD BE THE TICKET 
YOU WOULD BE GUARANTEEED GREAT 
WEATHER AND A WARM WELCOME IF YOU 
FLEW OUT OF TERMINAL FIVE WEEKEND 
WHAT WOULD YOU NOT BE GUARANTEEED 
IS YOUR LUGGAGE KAREN AND HER 
FIANCE ARE TYING THE KNOT IN WHAT 
WA WHICH THIS FRIDAY KAREN HAS A 
REAL PROBLEM HER WEDDING DRESS IS 
MISSING IT WAS CAUGHT UP IN THE 
TERMINAL FIVE LUGGAGE CHAOS WHEN THE 
COUPLE FLEW OUT OF HEATHROW THEY 
HAVE BEEN TOLD THE BAGS ARE STILL 
IN LONDON KAREN IS UNDERSTANDABLY 
DEVASTATED SO MUCH SO SHE ASKED 
JONATHAN TO DO THE TALKING 
AS A WOMAN LOOKING FOR HER HER 
ONCE IN A LIFETIME DRESS WHEN YOU 
HAVE HAD ALL THAT MONEY SAVED UP 
FOR YEARS AND IT IS NOT THE DAY YOU 
EXPECTED EXPECTED KAREN'S DRESS WAS BOUGHT IN THIS 
SHOP LAST SEPTEMBER IT IS VERY 
SIMILAR TO THIS ONE IN STYLE BUT 
EVEN IF THERE WAS A SPARE IN 
KAREN'S SIZE THERE IS ONLY TWENTY FOUR 
HOURS TO GO UNTIL THE BIG DAY AND 
HAWAII IS A LONG WAY FROM HALIFAX 
IF YOU HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS 
WHAT ARE YOU ENTITLED TO 
THE ONE 
THING THAT IS KEY YOU ARE NOT 
ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION FOR HAVING 
A RUINED HOLIDAY OR RUINED WEDDING 
THE MAIN THING IS THE MONTREAL 
CONVENTION CONVENTION UP UNTIL TWENTY ONE DAYS YOUR LUGGAGE IS 
DELAYED AND ALL YOU ARE ENTITLE TO 
IS REIMBURSEMENT FOR EMERGENCY 
EXPENDITURE B. A. DESCRIBES IT AS 
TOILETRIES AND PERHAPS A CHANGE OF 
CLOTHING IF YOUR LUGGAGE IS 
MISSING FOR OVER TWENTY ONE DAYS YOU CAN 
START A LOST LUGGAGE CLAIM AND 
THAT'S WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
PROPER COMPENSATION 
IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU MIGHT BE 
BEST OFF PUTTING A CLAIM IN THROUGH 
TRAVEL INSURANCE OR YOUR HOME 
CONTENTS INSURANCE 
WHAT'S THE OFFICIAL ADVICE OR WHAT 
SHOULD YOU DO 
I TALKED TO THE AIR 
TRANSPORT USERS COUNCIL YESTERDAY 
AND THEY SAID THE KEY THING YOU 
MUST DO IS REPORT YOUR LUSSAGE 
MISSING A THE LUGGAGE MISSING AT 
THE THE AIRPORT IF YOU DON'T DO 
THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE A 
SUBSEQUENT CLAIM BUY THE BARE 
MINIMUM BECAUSE THE CHANCES ARE THE 
AIRLINE WON'T FORK OUT IF YOU 
BOUGHT YOURSELF A WEDDING DRESS 
WRITE AN INTINRY OF EVERYTHING 
THAT'S IN YOUR SUITCASE TRY NOT TO 
PACK VALUE VALUABLES IF YOU HAVE 
TO PUT SOMETHING VALUABLE IN IN 
YOUR LUGGAGE WHEN YOU GO TO CHECK 
IN SAY I WANT TO MAKE A SPECIAL 
DECLARATION AND YOU PAY A SMALL FEE 
AND YOU GET EXTRA COVER 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH NICE TO HAVE 
YOU BACK 
IT IS LOVELY TO BE HEREMENT AFTER AFTER EIGHT ZERO ZERO A M. WE WILL SPEAK TO A NEW 
MOTHER WHOSE FIRST DAYS WITH HER 
BABY HAVE BEEN BLIGHTED BY THE 
LUGGAGE PROBLEMS 
COMING UP ON THE PROGRAMME TODAY 
IF GRANNY IS ALSO NANNY SHOULD SHE 
BE PAID FOR HER WORK WE WILL TALK 
TO TWO GRANDPARENTS ABOUT THE COST 
OF CARING 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED 
MILLION TO SPEND ON IMPROVING PLAY 
FACILITIES IN ENGLAND WHAT SHOULD 
THEY SPEND IT ON WELL I WILL BE 
ASKING THE EXPERTS 
FIRST LET'S GET THE WEATHER 
GOOD MORNING IT IS NOT A BAD START 
TO THE DAY TEMPERATURE WISE IN THE 
EAST IT IS CHILLY WITH FROST FOR 
MOST TODAY IT WILL BE MOSTLY DRY 
AND ALSO MILD THAT WILL ALL CHANGE 
AT THE WEEKEND 
BUT BEFORE THAT YOU CAN SEE ON THE 
SATELLITE PICTURE EASTERN AREAS 
BRIGHT THEN WE HAVE A FINGER OF 
CLOUD ACROSS SCOTLAND EXTENDING 
THROUGH THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
THROUGH SUSSEX THAT'S PRODUCING 
RAIN AND DRIZZLE OUT TO THE WEST 
AND THERE IS MURK AROUND WELL AS 
WELL BY NINE A M. RAIN ACROSS THE NORTH 
AND THE WESTMENT FOR THE NORTH WEST 
WE HAVE DRIZZLY BITS AND PIECES TO 
THE NORTH EAST BRIGHTER SKIES FOR 
MANY PARTS OF OF ENGLAND IT IS A 
CLOUDY START TO THE DAY WITH THE 
DRIZZLY RAIN AROUND 
INTO THE SOUTH WEST QUITE A BIT OF 
LOW CLOUD AND MIST ESPECIALLY SO 
CLOSE TO THE COAST BUT THERE WILL 
BE BREAKS AND SUNSHINE THE SAME 
FOR WALES HIG FOG AROUND AND 
COASTAL MIST 
QUITE A CLOUDY START ACROSS 
NORTHERN IRELANDMENT NOT COLD NINE 
CELSIUS IN BELFAST AT NINE A M. 
SO THE BEST OF THE BREAKS TODAY ARE 
GOING TO BE IN EASTERN AREAS 
THERE WILL BE A SEA BREEZE ALONG 
THE SOUTH COAST BUT AWAY FROM THAT 
IF YOU GO INLAND INTO THE SUNSHINE 
WE COULD TEMPERATURES AS HIGH AS SEVENTEEN 
CELSIUS OR NINETEEN CELSIUS 
NOW THROUGH THIS EVENING AND 
OVERNIGHT THERE WILL BE MIST AND 
FOG AROUND AGAIN ESPECIALLY CLOSE 
TO THE COAST AND THROUGH THE 
ENGLISH CHANNEL AND A NEW BAND OF 
RAIN PUSHING SOUTHWARDS ACROSS 
SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND AND 
COOLER AIR WILL COME IN BEHIND THAT 
BUT IT WILL BE MILD AHEAD OF IT 
AHEAD OF IT TOMORROW MORNING WE 
WILL HAVE A FAIR BIT OF CLOUD SOME 
MURK AROUND BUT BREAKS AND 
SUNSHINE COMING THROUGHMENT THE 
RAIN BAND TRUNDLE SOUTHWARDSMENT 
BEHIND IT CLEARER CONDITIONS 
COMING IN WITH SUNSHINEMENT AS WE 
HEAD INTO THE WEEKEND IT WILL TURN 
COLDER FOR ALL OF US AND THERE WILL 
BE SNOW ACROSS THE HILLS OF 
SCOTLAND EVEN TO LOWER LEVELS FOR 
A TIME IN SCOTLAND BUT IT WON'T 
LAST BECAUSE THE SUN IS STRONG AND 
IT WILL MELT BUT FOR THE REST OF 
THE BRITISH ISLES WE ARE LOOKING AT 
WINNERY SHOWERS THAT MEANS SLEET 
RAIN AND HAIL 
ALL THIS HOT AND COLD IS NOT GOOD 
FOR PEOPLE 
NO NO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T PUT AWAY YOUR 
WOOLIES YET 
DECLAN GOOD MORNING 
IT IS LIKE LISTENING TO MY 
GRANDMOTHER NON STOP LISTENING TO 
YOU THREE TALKING ABOUT THE 
WEATHER WEATHER NEWS FROM THE HIGH STREET MOSS 
BROS HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT ITS 
SALES THEY HAVE BEEN PLAIT THEY 
HAVEN'T GONE UP IN STORES IN THE U. K. 
MOSS BROS HAS BEEN IN THE US 
BECAUSE IT HAD APPROACH WHICH COULD 
LEAD TO TAKE OVER OFFER FROM AN 
ICELANDIC COMPANY NOT EVERY 
SHAREHOLDER WANTS TO SELL THE 
FAMILY IS RELUCTANT TO DO DEAL 
OTHER SHAREHOLDERS ARE PUTTING ON 
PRESSURE THE NEWS FROM MOSS BROS 
IT OPENED ITS BOOKS MOTHERCARE 
SAYS ITS SALES ARE UP BY NEARLY THREE PER CENT 
IN STORES OPEN FOR A YEAR OR MORE 
AT HALFORDS SALES THERE ARE UP BY 
FOUR PER CENT FOUR PER CENT MORE BIG MORTGAGE LENDERS SCRAPPED 
THEIR CHEAPEST HOME LOANS THE CO 
OP IS THE LATEST TO DO IT IT SAID 
IT HAD TOO MANY APPLICATIONS FOR 
ITS TWO YEAR DEALS YESTERDAY WE 
WERE TELLING YOU ABOUT FIRST DIRECT 
GETTING RID OF SOME DEALS 
ACCORDING TO MONEY FACTS THE NUMBER 
OF MORTGAGE DEALS HAS FALLEN BY A 
FIFTH OVER THE LAST WEEK A ROW 
OVER GAS PRICES THE COMPANY BEHIND 
BRITISH GAS SAYS THE BLAME FOR 
RISING GAS BILLS LIES WITH EUROPEAN 
GAS COMPANIES CENTRICA SAYS THE 
EUROPEAN FIRMS ARE BUYING UP UP 
SUPPLIES IN THE SUMMER BUT ARE NOT 
SELLING THEM BACK TO CUSTOMERS IN 
THE WINNERMENT SHARES IN LONDON 
YESTERDAY WERE UP 
THE B. B. C. LEARNED THAT THE COUNTRY'S 
LEADING DRUG EXPERTS WILL ADVICE 
THE PRIME MINISTER TO KEEP CANNABIS 
AS A CLASS C. DRUG IF GORDON BROWN 
DECIDES TO RECLASSIFY IT BACK TO 
CLASS B. HE WILL BE REJECTING THEIR 
FINDINGS AND THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE 
BEFORE BEFORE STEVE IS FROM TRANSFORM AN 
ORGANISATION WHICH IS CAMPAIGNING 
FOR A JUST AND EFFECTIVE DRUG 
POLICY WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN CLASS C. AND CLASS B. 
THE A. B. C. SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO RANK SYSTEMS ACCORDING TO THEIR 
HARM ON A VARIETY OF INDEXES TO DO 
WITH ADDICTION AND TOXICITY AND 
MORTALITY RATES IT DOES THAT 
REASONABLY WELL BUT THERE ARE A 
LOT OF CONTROVERSIES WITHIN IT 
IF A DRUG IS A CLASS C. DRUG LIKE 
CANNABIS IS AT THE MOMENT 
POSSESSION IS STILL ILLEGAL BUT IS 
NOT ACTED UPON 
THE HIERARCHY OF 
HARMS IS SUPER IMPOSED ON A 
HIERARCHY OF PENALTIES CLASS C. 
DRUGS ARE PUNISHABLE BY TWO YEARS 
MAXIMUM PRISON SENTENCES AND A 
SEVEN YEAR MAXIMUM PRISON SENTENCE 
FOR SUPPLY 
YOU THINK THE ADVISORY COUNCIL HAS 
GOT IT RIGHT IF THEY ARE THEY ARE 
SAYING KEEP IT AS IT IS AS A CLASS 
C. NOW 
THEY ARE A GROUP OF 
SCIENTISTS AND LOOKED AT THE 
EXISTING LITERATURE AND NEW 
RESEARCH SINCE THEY LAST REVIEWED 
THIS AND THEY MAKE A DECISION BASED 
ON THE SCIENCE IN TERMS OF RELATIVE 
HARM SO RELATIVE TO OTHER DRUGS 
THEY ARE NOT SAYING CANNABIS IS 
SAFE IT CLEARLY ISN'T IT IS NOT 
HARMLESS AND THEY ARE NOT SAYING 
AND NOR IS THE GOVERNMENT WHAT 
THEY ARE SAYING RELATIVE TO DRUGS 
IN CLASS A OR CLASS B. IT IS LESS 
LESS DANGEROUS NOT THAT IT IS NOT 
DANGEROUS AT ALL 
WE WERE TALKING TO MARJORIE WALLACE 
FROM SANE AND SHE SAYS WE DON'T 
KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE LINKS BETWEEN 
CANNABIS AND THE BRAIN 
PARTICULARLY THE DEVELOPING BRAIN 
AND YOUNGER TEENAGERS TAKING 
STRONG FORM EVER CANNABIS AND 
BECAUSE OF THAT WE REALLY SHOULD 
RECLASSIFY 
WELL THERE IS A LOT OF RECLASSIFY RESEARCH WE HAVE A FAIRLY CLEAR 
IDEA ABOUT THE INCIDENTS OF 
CERTAINLY MENTAL HEALTH THINGS 
SOSH ASSOCIATED WITH CANNABIS 
USEMENT AND THERE IS A LINK AND THE 
ACMD AND THE GOVERNMENT ACKNOWLEDGE 
IT NO ONE IS SAYING IT IS SAFE 
WHAT THEY ARE SAYING RELATIVE TO 
OTHER DRUGS IT IS RELATIVELY LESS 
HARMFUL BUT CERTAINLY WITH REGARDS 
TO YOUNG PEOPLE THE QUESTION IS 
WOULD MOVING IT TO CLASS B. 
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF ARRESTS 
AND INCREASING THE PRISON SENTENCES 
WOULD THAT REDUCE USE OR HARM 
ASSOCIATED WITH USE THERE IS NO 
EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST IT WOULD ON A 
PRAGMATIC BASIS IT SEEMS SENSIBLE 
TO KEEP IT WHERE IT IS 
YOU MIGHT 
THINK IT SHOULD BE CHILD'S PLAY 
BUT IT COULD BE DIFFICULT TO ENTICE 
CHILDREN AWAY FROM T. V.'S AND 
COMPUTERS AND GET GET THEM INTO THE 
OUTDOORS OUTDOORS PARENTS ACROSS ENGLAND HAVE BEEN 
ASKED WHAT THEY THINK SARAH 
CAMPBELL IS PLAYING HOPSCOTCH IN 
BRISTOL BRISTOL I'M EXHAUSTED THERE IS NO PROBLEM 
GETTING THE CHILDREN OF FONT HILL 
PRIMARY SCHOOL THEY ARE FULL OF 
BEANS AND OUTSIDE PLAYING THIS 
ISN'T THE CASE ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
TALK TO ANY EXPERT AND THEY WILL 
TELL YOU PLAY IS IMPORTANT 
PARTICULARLY PLAY OUTSIDE BUT IT 
IS NOT HAPPENING WHY NOT LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES HAVE GOT MILLIONS TO 
SPEND IMPROVING FACILITIES FOR PLAY 
OUTSIDE THE BIG QUESTION NOW WHICH 
PEOPLE LIKE THIS WILL BE ASKED 
PARTICULARLY IS JUST HOW THAT MONEY 
SHOULD BE SPENT 
IN SCHOOL THE PUPILS NEED LITTLE 
ENCOURAGEMENT TO LET THEMSELVES GO 
BUT AFTER SCHOOL IN COMMON WITH 
CHILDREN ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEY 
ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE ON THE 
COMPUTER THAN RUNNING AROUND 
OUTSIDE OUTSIDE THERE IS A LACK OF OF GOOD QUALITY 
ACCESSIBLE LOCAL PLAY FACILITIES 
PART OF IT IS DOWN TO PERHAPS 
PARENTS PERCEPTIONS OF THE SOCIETY 
NOT BEING VERY SAFE 
AND ACTUALLY YOU HAVE GOT TO SAY IT 
IS GOOD FUN SITTING DOWN WITH 
NINTENDO SOMETIMES 
THERE IS A POT OF OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION 
AVAILABLE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO 
SPEND ON IMPROVING PLAY FACILITIES 
AND IT IS HOPED THAT OVER THE NEXT 
THREE MONTHS EVERYONE FROM PLANNERS 
TO PARENTS TO CHILDREN WILL ADVICE 
ON HOW THAT MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT 
WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PLAY AREAS BRISTOL 
IS SEEN AS ONE OF THE LEADING LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES WHEN IT COMES TO 
PROVIDING PLAY SPACES AND THEY SAY 
CONSULTING THEIR YOUNG CONSUMERS IS 
THE KEY TO SUCCESS 
AT EVERY LOCATION WE DEVELOP WE 
TALK TO CHILDREN THEY ARE THE KEY 
PLAYERS AND WE WE ASK THEM THE 
TYPE OF EXPERIENCES THEY WANT AS 
CHILDREN TO BE THERE DO YOU WANT A 
SPIN MAN DO YOU WANT TO BE 
FRIGHTENED DO YOU WANT TO BE UP 
HIGH AND WE BUILD FROM WHAT THEY 
TELL US 
THESE PUPILS ARE OLD HANDS WHEN IT 
COMES TO DECIDING WHEN IT COMES TO 
PLAY THEY DESIGNED THE PLAYGROUND 
AND ARE FULL OF IDEAS 
I WOULD LIKE A TREE WITH TREE 
HOUSE IN IT WHERE WE COULD GO AND 
PLAY IN THE TREE HOUSE 
VERY BIG SWIMMING POOL WITH A ZOO 
AROUND IT LOVE ANIMALS 
A BALL PIT A SLIDER WITH THE 
SWIMMING POOL AND I WOULD HAVE A 
TRAMPOLINE WITH A SAFETY NET 
A DEATH SLIDE WHICH GOES DOWN TO 
BALL PIT SO NOBODY WOULD GET HURT 
SWIMMING POOLS AND A ZOO MAYBE 
AMBITIOUS FOR MOST PLAY AREAS BUT 
ALL IDEAS WILL BE CONSIDERED 
ALL IDEAS INDEED 
WHAT FANTASTIC IDEAS THEY HAVE GOT 
I HAVE TWO HERE THIS IS TOM AND 
REBECCA REBECCA TOM YOU ARE PLEASED WITH THE IDEA 
THAT CHILDREN WANT TO TO CONTRIBUTE 
AND TALK ABOUT HOW PLAY AREAS WILL 
BE IMPROVED WHY IS THAT BECAUSE BECAUSE SOMETIMES ADULTS DON'T KNOW WHAT 
KIDS WANT AND KIDS KNOW THE BEST 
AND THIS IS A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE 
YOU GUYS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
DESIGNING THIS PLAYGROUND YOU HAVE 
GOT THINGS LIKE MOUNDS 
I WAS HERE YESTERDAY WHAT IDEAS 
DID YOU COME UP WITH 
THE THINGS ON 
THE FLOOR THE PAINTING THE STICKS 
IN THE GROUND AND THE MOUNDS 
YES YES MORE PLAY EQUIPMENT FOR KEY STAGE 
ONE AND KEY STAGE TWO 
REBECCA IT IS DIFFICULT FINDING 
GOOD PLACES TO COME AND PLAY AFTER 
SCHOOL YES SCHOOL YES WHAT DO YOU TEND TO DO 
PLAY ON THE 
COMPUTER AT HOME 
IT IS GOOD TO DO 
BECAUSE IT IS GOOD TO DO 
I WILL LET YOU GET BACK TO PLAYING 
THAT'S THE KEY TRYING TO GET KIDS 
OFF THE COMPUTER THIS NATIONAL 
CONSULTATION IT IS ABOUT MAKING 
TOWNS AND CITIES MORE CHILD 
FRIENDLY STREETS THAT IT IS EASIER 
FOR THEM TO GO OUT AND PLAY 
AND MAYBE HAVING LESS SIGNS SAYING 
NO BALL GAMES OR NO SKATEBOARDING 
HERE IT SHOULD BE AN INTERESTING 
THREE MONTHS IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING TO HEAR WHAT THESE 
PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO SAY ABOUT IT 
OFF YOU GO AND PLAY AND 
HAVE FUN 
I LOVE THAT LITTLE BOY SAYING HE 
WANTS SWIMMING POOL AND ZOO

CHELSEA JUST ABOUT IN IT LIVERPOOL

THE EQUALISER THAT COULD BE A VERY 
IMPORTANT AWAY GOAL ARSENAL FEEL 
AGGRIEVED THEY WERE DENIED A 
PENALTY LOOK AT THIS HOW DID 
CESC FABREGAS MISS THIS CHANCE 
WELL THE ANSWER IS NICOLAS BENDTNER 
SAVED IT FROM GOING OVER THE GOAL 
LINE LINE WE ARE NOT WELL PAID FOR WHAT WE 
PRODUCED TONIGHT TO FINISH GAME 
LIKE THIS ONE IS OF COURSE 
DISAPPOINTING WE PRODUCED A 
PERFORMANCE WE WANTED AND ALTHOUGH 
WE HAD THE CHANCES TO WIN THE GAME 
AND LIVERPOOL CREATED VERY LITTLE 
TONIGHT 
WE ARE IN A GOOD POSITION TONIGHT WE ARE PLAYING A. N. N. FEELTD WITH ALL 
OUR SUPPORTERS IT IS A MASSIVE 
DIFFERENCE AGAINST A GOOD TEAM 
QUALITY YOU COULD SEE TODAY PLENTY 
OF POSSESSIONS COUNTER ATTACK AND 
PLAYING HARD IN DEFENCE CHELSEA CHELSEA WILL BE FEELING FAIRLY CONFIDENT 
DESPITE LOSING TWO TO ONE TO FENERBAHCE IN

MINUTE WE WERE SLIPPING TO THE GAME 
AND AGAIN WE HAD A GREAT CHANCE TO 
MAKE TWO TO ONE AND THIS FOR TWENTY FIVE METRES 
NORMALLY IT IS NOT A BAD RESULT 
WHEN YOU SCORE AWAY BUT THE 
PERFORMANCE WAS DISAPPOINTING 
TONIGHT THERE IS MORE FOOTBALL WITH 
SPORTING LISBON IN THE QUARTER 
FINALS OF OF THE UEFA CUP LIAM 
TANCOCK BECAME THE FIRST BRIT TO

RUNS WERE RUN THIS MORNING INDIA 
WON THES TO AND BATTED THEY HAVE 
BEEN DISMISSED ON TWENTY OVERS THEY 
WERE ALL OUT FOR SEVENTY SIX 
JUST A QUICK LOOK AT THE BACK PAGES 
OF THE NEWSPAPERS DOMINATED BY THE 
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE THEY SAY 
CLIFFHANGER IT IS ADVANTAGE TO 
LIVERPOOL THAT IS WHAT THE DAILY 
MAIL BELIEVE THE BACK PAGE OF THE 
SUN DIRKY TRICKS A PENALTY CLAIM 
IN THAT MATCH AND JUST INSIDE 
PAGES OF THE MIRROR THEY ARE 
CELEBRATING THE OLDEST SWIMMER IN 
TOWN THAT IS MARK FOST WHORE HAS 
QUALIFIED FOR THE OLYMPIC GAMES AT 
THE RIPE OLD AGE OF THIRTY SEVEN AND WE ARE 
TALKING 
ABOUT THE OLDEST MAN IN THE GAMES HE BEGAN AT SIXTY 
THERE IS STILL HOPE FOR ME 
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU KNEW THE 
SITES YOU VISITED ON THE INTERNET 
WERE MONITORED BY YOUR SERVICE 
PROVIDER WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT THAT 
IS WHAT HAPPENED TO THOUSANDS OF B. T. 
CUSTOMERS DURING THE TRIAL OF A NEW 
SYSTEM WHICH TAR GETHED CUSTOMERS 
WITH PRODUCTS THEY MAY BE LIKELY TO 
BUY BUY JULIE MEYER AND GUY PHILLIPSON JOIN 
ME JULIE FIRST OF ALL MANY 
PEOPLE E. MAILING US VERY CONCERNED 
THAT THEIR ACTIVITIES ON LINE WERE 
MONITORED IS THIS A COMMON 
MONITORED IS THIS A COMMON PRACTICE 
ANY SEARCH ENGINE PRACTICE WHETHER GOOGLE OR OTHERS ARE 
MONITORING WHETHER OR NOT IT 
HAPPENS TO I. S. P. TO WHAT EXTENT 
INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER ISN'T 
THAT CRUCIAL POINT THE I. S. P. THE 
PEOPLE PROVIDING YOU WITH YOUR 
SERVICE WHO ARE DOING THE SNOOPING 
AGAIN I WOULD NOT TAKE IT PERSONAL 
IT IS NOT SO MUCH SNOOPING IT IS A 
QUESTION OF THE PUBLIC BEING 
BROUGHT UP TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS 
HAPPENING WITH THE TECHNOLOGY ON 
LINE I THINK I THINK B. T. SHOULD 
HAVE JUST SOUGHT OUT A TEST GROUP 
THERE IS ALWAYS THAT TWO PER CENT OF ANY 
COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS WHO WILL SAY I 
WILL GIVE YOU FEEDBACK 
IS THIS 
WHAT MOST PEOPLE ARE DOING TRYING 
TO FIND OUT WHAT WE ARE DOING ON 
LINE AND THEN YOU ARE IN THE 
BUSINESS OF ADVERTISING WITH 
REGARDS TO THAT 
YES INTERNET 
ADVERTISING HAS GROWN FROM NOTHING 
TO SURPASS TWO BILLION IN TWO THOUSAND SIX IT 
WILL SURPASS THREE BILLION THIS YEAR 
AND TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE 
TELEVISION ADVERTISING IS WORTH 
ABOUT THREE POINT NINE BILLION IT WILL 
OVERTAKE THAT IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS PROBABLY 
ONLY A SMALL PER CENTAGE OF 
ADVERTISING ON LINE IS BEHAVIOURLY 
TARGETED IT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 
A TIME L. THINK AN IMPORTANT POINT 
WAS MADE IT IS ANONYMOUS IT IS I. P. 
ADDRESSES SO IT IS MACHINES ANYONE 
COULD USE IN THE HOUSE ADVERTISING 
IS SERVED ACCORDING TO BEHAVIOUR 
B. T. SAYING FIRMLY THEY SAY THEY 
DON'T THINK WHAT THEY DID WAS 
ILLEGAL ONE OR TWO EXPERTS BEGGING 
TO DIFFER THE REACTION FROM OUR 
VIEWERS THIS MORNING IS MOST ARE 
OUTRAGED BY IT 
I THINK THAT IS WHY 
I THINK THIS IS MORE AN ERROR OF 
CUSTOMER SERVICE L. AM SURE THEY 
HAVE TAKEN LEGAL ADVICE THEY 
MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW 
PEOPLE TO SELECT THEMSELVES INTO 
THIS KIND OF TRIAL RATHER THAN 
ALLOWING IT TO BE DISCOVERED IN 
THIS WAY THAT IS THE PEOPLE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE IDEA IN GENERAL THAT 
SOMEBODY IS IN A SENSE LOCKING OVER 
THEIR SHOULDER WHEN THEY ARE ON THE 
INTERNET 
WHEN YOU ARE SEARCHING ON INTERNET LINE UNLESS YOU REMOVE WHAT IS 
TERMED YOUR COOKIES ON LINE THIS 
PAPER TRIAL YOU LEAVE ON LINE AND 
AGAIN THERE IS TECHNOLOGY WHICH 
ENABLES YOU TO DO THAT MORE 
WIDESPREAD AND SO FORTH YOU LEAVE 
A PAPER TRIAL ON LINE THIS IS THE 
PUBLIC BEING BROUGHT UP TO WHERE 
TECHNOLOGY IS THE FACT IS YOU ARE 
MONITORED ON LINE 
WHERE CAN WE GO 
AS USERS SOME OF OUR VIEWERS DO 
NOT WANT TO BE MONITORED WHERE DO 
YOU GO HOW DO YOU STOP THAT OR DO 
YOU HAVE TO STOP USING THE INTERNET 
IN 
NOT AT ALL JULIA MENTIONED THE IN COOKIES WHICH IS A TRIAL SAY YOU 
ARE ON AN I. S. P. OR A PORTAL LIKE 
YAHOO THEY WILL GIVE YOU GUIDANCE 
TO HOW TO DELETE YOUR COOKIES IN 
WHICH CASE THE INTERNET FORGETS 
WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN AND THEN YOU 
WILL NOT BE TARGETED WITH 
ADVERTISING WHICH MAY BE MORE 
RELEVANT TO YOU IRONICALLY AND AT 
THE SAME TIME YOU MIGHT FIND THAT 
EBAY FORGETS WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN 
BUYING OR WHEN YOU GO ON TO AMAZON 
IT IS NOT SO HELPFUL AS IT USED TO 
BE SO YOU HAVE TO BE WEARY OF THAT 
AS WELL THE OTHER POINT IS ON ANY 
PUBLISHING WHO DOES TARGETING WILL 
GIVE YOU AN OPT OUT 
KEEP OPTING 
OUT 
LIKE 
YOU CAN OPT OUT OF MAIL OUT YOU CAN DO THE SAME THING ON YOUR 
COMBERMERE PUETER 
GLENN IN THE 
WIRRAL SAYS EVEN IF B. T. FOUND THEY 
ARE WITHIN THE LAW WHICH HE SAYS 
SEEMS PROBLEMATIC THEIR ACTIVITY 
IS RUDE SOMEBODY ELSE SAYING B. T. 
HAVE WHY TRUST B. T. 
I WOULD AGREE THERE WAS A MISSED 
OPPORTUNITY IN THE WAY IT WAS 
EXECUTED AND IN HIND SITE I AM SURE 
THAT IS THE CONCLUSION THEY WILL 
DRAW INTERNALLY THERE WAS A BETTER 
WAY TO RULE THIS OUT WHEN THEY ROLL 
IT OUT AS THEY WILL ACROSS THEIR 
ENTIRE CUSTOMER BASE PEOPLE WILL 
HAVE THESE CHOICES GUY ALLUDED TO 
BACK TO THE COOKIES POINT ON MY 
MACHINE I HAVE SOMETHING WHICH SAYS 
CLEAR ALL PRIVATE DATA AT THE END 
OF EVERY SESSION WHICH I CL CLICK 
THAT IS IT COOKIES CAN BE FOLLOWED 
AROUND IF IT IS DELETED IT CANNOT 
FOLLOW WHAT YOU DO 
THIS IS BREAKFAST THESE ARE THE 
MAIN MAIN STORIES THE BODY WHICH 
ADVISES MINISTERS ON DRUGS POLICY

SCOTLAND ALSO PATCHY RAIN AT THE 
MOMENT AND DRIZZLE ACROSS THE 
NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND BUT TO THE 
NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND SOME 
BRIGHTER SKIES AS WE MOVE TOWARDS

TO PRODUCE DRIZZLE HERE AND THERE 
REALLY THROUGH HAMPSHIRE INTO 
SUSSEX SUSSEX FOR THE SOUTH WEST AND WALES SOME 
BREAKS BUT HILL FOG AROUND TODAY 
WITH COASTAL MIST AND MURK 
GENERALLY CLOSE TO THE COAST IN THE 
SOUTH AND THE WESTMENT THERE WILL 
BE SEA BREEZE DEVELOPING BUT MORE 
INLAND AND WHEN WE GET THE BREAKS 
IN THE CLOUD WE ARE LOOKING AT 
SUNNIER SKIES AND IT WILL FEEL 
MILDMENT GENERALLY OUR TEMPERATURE 
SIXTEEN TO SEVENTEEN CELSIUS BUT IN THE 
SUNNIER SPOTS AWAY FROM THE WIND 
WE COULD HAVE NINETEEN CELSIUS AND THE 
LIKELIEST PLACES ARE EXETER AND 
SOUTHAMPTON SOUTHAMPTON JUST TO HEADS UP ON WHAT'S 
HAPPENING THIS WEEKEND IT IS GOING 
TO BE COLD COLD WHEREVER YOU ARE 
THE WHOLE COUNTRY WILL NOTICE A BIG 
DIFFERENCE IN THE TEMPERATURES WE 
ARE LOOKING AT A A DROP OF TEN 
CELSIUS AND WE ARE LOOKING AT 
SNOWMENT THE SNOW PREDOMINANTLY 
WILL BE IN SCOTLAND AND IT WON'T 
LAST BECAUSE THE SUN IS STRONG AT 
THIS TIME OF THE YEARMENT FOR 
ENGLAND AND WALES AND NORTHERN 
IRELAND IT WILL BE A WINNERY MIX 
WINTRY MIX 
DON'T PUT AWAY YOUR WOOLIES YET 
EVEN INTO NEXT WEEK IT WILL REMAIN 
NIPPY NIPPY SORRY CAROL WE LOST YOU FOR A 
SECOND BUT WE GOT YOU BACK MUCH 
TO THE VIEWERS RELIEF 
MONEY MATTERS MORE LENDERS ARE 
WITHDRAWING SPECIAL DEALS ON 
MORTGAGES MORTGAGES DECLAN HAS MORE THIS STARTED WITH 
FIRST DIRECT YESTERDAY 
WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT IT AT THIS TIME 
YESTERDAY WITH FIRST DIRECT WITH 
WITH DRALLING ITS WITH 
WITHDRAWING ITS CHEAPEST MORTGAGE 
DEALS A NUMBER OF AMERICAN 
COMPANIES HAVE EFFECTIVELY PULLED 
OUT OF THE MORTGAGE BUSINESS NOW 
AND THE OTHER BIG NAME IS THE CO OP 
BANK WHICH SAID IT WAS GETTING RID 
OF SOME OF ITS SPECIAL TWO YEAR 
DEALS NOW THIS IS ALL PART OF A 
PATTERN YOU HAVE GOT SOME BANKS 
GETTING RID OF THEIR CHEAPEST DEALS 
YOU HAVE OTHER LENDERS INCREASING 
MORTGAGE COSTS EVEN THOUGH OFFICIAL 
INTEREST RATES ARE FALLING THE 
COST OF MORTGAGES IS RISE RISING 
AND YOU HAVE BANKS AND BUILDING 
SOCIETIES LOOKING FOR BIGGER 
DEPOSITS IT IS DOWN TO THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU IF 
YOU ARE TRYING TO GET A MORTGAGE 
WE SPOKE TO A COUPLE FROM BOLTON 
YESTERDAYMENT THEY ARE A YOUNG 
COUPLE AND WORK FULL TIME IN 
NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES THEY PROBABLY 
WOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM GET AGO 
MORTGAGE BUT THESE AREN'T NORMAL 
TIMES 
WE STARTED LOOKING FOR A TIMES HOUSE AND WENT TO A FINANCIAL 
ADVISOR WE FOUND A PROPERTY AND 
THE MORTGAGE ADVISOR SAID WE COULD 
GET A MORTGAGE AND WITHIN A WEEK 
HE CAME BACK AND SAID WE WOULD HAVE 
TO PUT TOGETHER A DEPOSIT OF FIVE PER CENT TO 
TEN PER CENT WHILST WE ARE PUTTING THAT 
TOGETHER HE CAME BACK AND SAID IT 
HAD BEEN INCREASED 
YOU GET STUCK WITH THE SITUATION 
WE HAD SEEN A HOUSES THAT WAS 
PERFECT WE KNEW WE NEEDED ONE HUNDRED PER CENT 
MORTGAGE ON IT AND YOU CONDITION 
GET IT IT YOU CAN'T GET IT AND 
YOUR DREAM IS GONE AND YOU ARE 
LOOKING AT AREN'TING 
DECLAN THE DAILY MAIL'S FRONT PAGE 
THAT THREE MILLION FAMILIES COULD 
BE PLUNGED INTO NEGATIVE EQUITY 
THAT'S WHEN THE VALUE OF YOUR HOUSE 
IS SMALLER THAN THE VALUE OF YOUR 
MORTGAGE SO YOU ARE IN INSTANT DEBT 
AND IT IS SOMETHING MANY BREAKFAST 
VIEWERS MIGHT REMEMBER FROM THE 
EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES NOW WE HAVE BEEN 
LOOKING INTO THE DAILY MAIL SURVEY 
AND BEEN TALKING TO THE COUNCIL OF 
MORTGAGE LENDERS AND THEY DRAW OUR 
ATTENTION TO TWO THINGS THIS IS 
BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT IF YOU 
HAVE GOT MORTGAGE THAT COVERS NINETY PER CENT 
THE VALUE OF YOUR PROPERTY IF 
HOUSE PRICES FALL BY TEN PER CENT OR MORE 
IN THIS YEAR YOU WILL BE IN 
NEGATIVE EQUITY THEY SAY THAT THEY 
THINK PREDICTION OF A TEN PER CENT FALL IN 
HOUSE PRICES ARE PROBABLY TOUCH 
ALARMIST THE OTHER THING THEY 
QUERY THEY DON'T THINK THERE ARE 
THREE MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE 
SITTING ON NINETY PER CENT OR ABOVE MORTGAGES 
THEY DON'T THINK THERE ARE AS MANY 
PEOPLE AS AFFECTED AS THE NEWSPAPER 
NEWSPAPER ARTICLE SUGGESTS AND THEY 
DON'T THINK HOUSE PRICES WILL FALL 
AS SHARPLY AS WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN 
FOR LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE TO GO 
INTO NEGATIVE EQUITILY BUT IT 
CAN'T BE RULED OUT 
FLESH FLOWERS ARE GROWING MARKET 
AND WE SPEND TWO POINT FIVE BILLION ON THEM

BUSINESS WAS LOSING MONEY UNTIL 
SOME PASSING TOURISTS GAVE THEM 
FRESH IDEA 
WE WERE ASKED BY VISITORS TO THE 
ISLANDS COULD WE SPEND SOME OF OUR 
FLOWERS BY POST SO YES WE COULD 
IT WAS SOMETHING WE WEREN'T GEARED 
UP FOR BUT WE DID START DOING THAT 
IN A SMALL WAY TO START WITH ONE 
OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS FOR US BY 
SENDING BY POST WAS THE FACT THAT 
WE ONLY HAD POSTAL SERVICE ON THE 
ISLANDS THREE DAYS WEEK 
SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER WITH MUCH 
IMPROVED POSTAL SERVICE AND A 
FLASHY WEBSITE SENT FROM THE 
ISLANDS IS THRIVING 
EACH YEAR THEY SEND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND BOXES 
PACKED WITH OVER TWENTY FIVE MILLION 
FLOWERS DIRECT TO CUSTOMERS 
WE ARE NOT GOING THROUGH THE 
WHOLESALE MARKETS THEREFORE WE 
CAN COMPETE AGAINST FLOWERS BEING 
FLOWN IN FROM KENYA WE DON'T HAVE 
A LARGE CARBON FOOTPRINT AND PEOPLE 
ARE MORE AND MORE AWARE OF THAT 
BY CUTTING OUT THE MIDDLE MAN AND 
MAKING THE MOST OF THEIR SCENTED

ITALY COLUMBIA CHINA IT IS NOT 
AN ENGLISH THING ANYMORE

SHANNON MATTHEWS IS CHARGED WITH 
POSSESSING INDECENT IMAGES OF

ADMITS TRACKING EIGHTEEN THOUSAND BROADBAND 
USERS AS THEY BROWSED THE WEB

TIMES FOR THE BRITISH FLOWER 
INDUSTRY INDUSTRY AFTER NINE HUNDRED A M. THE LATEST APPRENTICE 
TO BE FIRED WILL BE HERE 
THERE WAS A LOT OF LAUNDRY REALLY 
DIRTY LAUNDRY AND SOME TERRIBLE 
ROWS AFTERWARDS 
FIRST OUR MAIN STORY THE 
GOVERNMENT COULD BE ON A COLLISION 
COURSE WITH THE OFFICIAL BODY THAT 
ADVISES IT ON DRUGS POLICY B. B. C. 
NEWS HAS LEARNED THAT THE ADVISORY 
COUNCIL ON THE MISUSE OF DRUGS HAS 
DECIDED DAN BUSINESS SHOULD REMAIN 
AS CLASS C. DRUG THAT SEEMS TO GO 
AGAINST THE VIEWS OF THE PRIME 
MINISTER WHO SUGGESTED THIS WEEK 
THAT HE WANTS TO RESTORE CANNABIS 
TO THE MORE SERIOUS CLASS B. DRUG 
CANNABIS WAS DOWNGRADED FROM 
CLASS B. DRUG TO CLASS C. IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
THAT MEANT MANY OF THOSE CAUGHT 
WITH IT BEING GIVEN A WARNING 
RATHER THAN BEING 
CHARGED 
THE MOVE WAS DESIGNED TO FREE UP 
POLICE TIME 
TO ALLOW THEM TO CONCENTRATE ON 
TACKLING HARDER DRUGS AMID CONCERN 
ABOUT THE INCREASE IN STRENGTH OF 
SOME TYPES OF THE DRUG GORDON 
BROWN HAS INDICATED I FAVOURS 
MAKING CANNABIS A CLASS B. DRUG 
AGAIN ON A PAR WITH AMPHETAMINES 
AND CARRYING A MAX FIVE YEAR 
SENTENCE FOR POSSESSION BUT THE 
B. B. C. HAS LEARNED THAT THE 
ADVISORY COUNCIL 
MEETING IN PRIVATE YESTERDAY 
CONCLUDED THAT CANNABIS SHOULD 
REMAIN A CLASS C. DRUG A DECISION 
THAT HAS ALREADY RECEIVED A MIXED 
RECEPTION RECEPTION YOUNG PEOPLE LITERALLY DICING WITH 
THEIR MINDS AND THEIR FUTURES IF 
YOU HAVE EVER SEEN SOMEBODY WHO HAS 
TAKEN CANNABIS AND GONE ON A TRIP 
FROM WHICH THEY'VE NEVER REALLY 
RETURN AND YOU SEE THE COLLATERAL 
DAMAGE TO THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES 
THEN YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FROM 
THAT POINT OF VIEW 
THE QUESTION IS WOULD MOVING IT TO 
CLASS B. I. E. INCREASING THE NUMBER 
OF ARRESTS OF YOUNG PEOPLE 
INCREASING THE PRISON SENTENCES FOR 
THOSE PEOPLE WERE THEY ARRESTED 
WOULD THAT REDUCE USE OR HARM 
ASSOCIATED WITH USE I DON'T THINK 
THERE IS ANY EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST IT 
WOULD 
THIS LEAVES GORDON BROWN IN WOULD AN AWKWARD POSITION EARLIER THIS 
WEEK HE INDICATED HIS STRONG 
SUPPORT FOR RECLASSIFYING CANNABIS 
BUT NEVER BEFORE HAS THE GOVERNMENT 
IGNORED THE ADVICE OF ITS 
SPECIALIST PANEL 
POLICE IN WEST YORKSHIRE HAVE 
CHARGED THE STEPFATHER OF SHANNON 
MATTHEWS WITH TEN COUNTS OF 
POSSESSING INDECENT IMAGES OF 
CHILDREN TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD CRAIG MEEHAN 
WILL APPEAR BEFORE DEWSBURY 
MAGISTRATES' COURT LATER THIS 
MORNING THIS REPORT DOES CONTAIN 
FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY 
WEST YORKSHIRE POLICE ARRESTED 
CRAIG MEEHAN AT HIS HOME IN 
DEWSBURY YESTERDAY MORNING AFTER A 
DAY OF QUESTIONING HE WAS CHARGED 
LAST NIGHT WITH TEN OFFENCES OF 
POSSESSING INDECENT IMAGES OF

LIVED WITH SHANNON'S MOTHER FOR 
SEVERAL YEARS IS DUE TO APPEAR

B. T. HAS ADMITTED MONITORING THE 
ACTIVITIES OF EIGHTEEN THOUSAND INTERNET USERS 
WITH WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT SOME 
EXPERTS SAY THE ACTIVITIES WERE 
ILLEGAL B. T. SAYS IT TOOK LEGAL 
ADVICE AND DID NOT BREAK THE LAW 
THE TELECOMS COMPANY HAS TOLD 
BREAKFAST IT WAS TESTING NEW 
TECHNOLOGY WHICH WOULD ALLOW 
ADVERTISERS TO TARGET POTENTIAL 
CUSTOMERS BUT THE INFORMATION WAS 
NEVER USED 
WHETHER YOU ARE LOOKING UP DETAILS 
FOR YOUR NEXT HOLIDAY DESTINATION 
OR BROUGHTING THE INTERNET FOR A 
RECIPE YOUR PREFERENCES AND 
INTERESTS REVEAL AN ASTONISHING 
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU 
AND THAT INFORMATION COULD BE 
EXTREMELY VALUABLE FOR ADVERTISERS 
THE TECHNOLOGY THAT TURNS YOUR 
CLICKS INTO HARD CASH IS ALREADY 
BEING TESTED BY MAJOR TELECOMS 
FIRMS FIRMS THE TECHNOLOGY WORKS BY TRACKING 
YOUR INTERNET SEARCHES FOR EXAMPLE 
IF I DECIDED I WANTED TO LOSE SOME 
WEIGHT AND ENTERED WEIGHT LOSS 
INTO A SEARCH ENGINE THAT SEARCH 
WOULD THEN BE INTERCEPTED BY THE 
ADVERTISING TOOL AND RELEVANT 
MARKETING CAMPAIGNS FROM DIFFERENT 
COMPANIES WOULD BE SENT BACK TO ME 
BUT NOW IT'S EMERGED B. T. HAS BEEN 
TESTING THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT 
USERS' PERMISSION OR CONSENT 
INITIAL TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT ON 
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND CUSTOMERS IN TWO THOUSAND SIX FURTHER 
TESTS WERE ALSO CARRIED OUT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS ILLEGAL 
WE HAVE CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE LEGAL 
OR SOUGHT EXTENSIVE LEGAL ADVICE 
BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY AND 
PRIOR TO CONDUCTING THIS TRIAL 
CUSTOMERS WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED AT 
THE TIME IT WAS COMPLETELY 
ANONYMOUS NO PERSONALISABLE 
INFORMATION WAS SHARED NO 
INFORMATION WAS STORED OR DIVULGED 
EXPERTS SAY WHETHER B. T. USED THE 
INFORMATION OR NOT THEY BROKE THE 
LAW LAW IT SEEMS REALLY QUITE A CLEAR CASE 
OF ILLEGAL INTERCEPTION OF THE 
COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THEIR 
CUSTOMERS AND THE WEBSITES WHERE 
THEY'RE BROWSING 
THE NATION COMMISSIONER IS NOW 
INVESTIGATING B. T.'S ACTIONS 
EFFORTS ARE UNDER WAY TO RELEASE A 
BRITISH CRUISE SHIP WHICH HAS BEEN 
IMPOUNDED BY AUTHORITIES ON THE 
PORTUGUESE 
ISLAND 
OF MADEIRA THE 
VAN GOGH WHICH HAS MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED 
PASSENGERS ON BOARD IS BEING HELD 
BECAUSE OF ALLEGED DEBTS BY THE 
SHIP'S OWNERS IT'S ON THE FINAL 
LEG OF A WORLD CRUISE AND HAD BEEN 
DUE BACK IN FALMOUTH THIS SATURDAY 
PASSENGER IVAN WARD SAID THOSE ON 
BOARD WERE AVOIED AT BEING DETAINED 
BECAUSE OF A LEGAL ARGUMENT BUT 
WERE IN GOOD SPIRITS 
WE'RE BEING LOOKED AFTER VERY WELL 
BY THE CREW THERE'S OBVIOUSLY 
PLENTY OF FOOND DRINK ON BOARD BUT 
MOST OF THE PASSENGERS WANT TO GET 
HOME WE'RE AT THE END OF THREE 
MONTH CRUISE AND THEY'VE GOT 
ARRANGEMENTS TO MAKE BACK HOME AND 
WANT TO SEE THEIR RELATIVES 
A NETWORK OF NATURE RESERVES COULD 
BE ESTABLISHED IN THE SEAS AROUND 
BRITAIN THE MARINE BILL PUBLISHED 
TODAY ARE EXPECTED TO REGULATE 
FISHERIES FISHERIES JEREMY COOKE IS IN BRIXHAM ON THE 
SOUTH DEVON COAST FOR US 
A BEAUTIFUL DAY HERE AT THE BURY 
HEAD NATURE RESERVE THE WILDLIFE 
HERE ON LAND ENJOYS SERIOUS 
PROTECTION IN LAW BUT UNTIL NOW 
THAT IS NOT THE CASE OUT AT SEA 
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT HAS TO 
CHANGE AND IT'S PROPOSING A HUGE 
NETWORK OF NATURE MARINE NATURE 
CONSERVATION ZONES 
IT IS BEAUTIFUL AND ALL PART OF OUR 
NATURAL HERITAGE BUT WHILE ON LAND 
THEY RESTRICT PROTECTION FOR 
WILDLIFE AND HABITAT IN THE SEA 
IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY UNTIL NOW 
JUST TWO PER CENT OF BRITISH WATERS WHICH ARE 
AMONG THE WORLD'S RICHEST MARINE 
ENVIRONMENT HAVE BEEN SET ASIDE AS 
PROTECTED AREAS TODAY THE 
GOVERNMENT WILL ANNOUNCE ITS MASTER 
PLAN TO SAFEGUARD OUR SEAS AND IT 
WILL CREATE A NETWORK OF MARINE 
CONSERVATION ZONES BY TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SOME 
TWENTY PER CENT OF OUR TERRITORIAL WATERS 
PERHAPS SOME ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE 
KILOMETRES WILL BE DEEMED 
PROTECTION ZONES CONSERVATIONISTS 
SAY IT'S ABOUT TIME 
THERE'S BEEN SUCH A HOTCHPOTCH OF 
DIFFERENT BITS AND PIECES MOST OF 
THEM WITH LITTLE POWERS TO BRING 
THEM TOGETHER SO THAT ONE PIECE OF 
LEGISLATION IS NOT COUNTER ACTING 
ANOTHER WILL BE WISHAL STOPPING STOPPING THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY TRAWLERS IN 
SOME SENSITIVE AND VULNERABLE AREAS 
IS MOST OF THE AIMS OF THE MARINE 
BILL BILL FISHERMEN LIKE DAVE CUTHBERT KNOW 
THE PROPOSED NEW RULES MAY FURTHER 
LIMIT HIS FREEDOM TO FISH AT THAT 
TIME WHEN HE IS BALLOTING QUOTA 
LIMITS LIMITS WE NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE 
DECISION MAKING PROCESS ABOUT WHERE 
THESE AREAS GO AND EXACTLY WHAT 
THEY ARE 
WHAT THE RULES ARE WHEN 
THEY'RE SET UP 
WHAT THE RULES ARE 
AND WHAT SORT OF FISHING WILL BE 
ALLOWED IN THERE 
TODAY'S BILL 
GIVES A VERY BROAD BRUSH APPROACH 
ABOUT HOW BEST TO PROTECT OUR 
MARINE WILDLIFE FOR INSTANCE IT 
LEAVES OPEN JUST HOW MUCH OF OUR 
SEAS SHOULD BE MADE CONSERVATION 
ZONES AND WHAT LEVEL OF PROTECTION 
THEY SHOULD HAVE 
THERE'S GOOD NEWS THIS MORNING IN 
THIS PROPOSED BILL FOR PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE CAMPAIGNED FOR GREATER ACCESS 
TO THE COASTAL FOOTPATHS AROUND 
ENGLAND THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT 
WILL OPEN UP THE ENTIRE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MILES 
OF COAST AROUND ENGLAND TO GENERAL 
PUBLIC ACCESS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE HAVE BEEN 
TOLD THEY'RE ENTERING A NEW 
POLITICAL ERA FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SINCE INDEPENDENCE THE ZANU P. F. 
THE RULING PARTY OF PRESIDENT 
MUGABE HAS LOST CONTROL OF 
PARLIAMENT ALTHOUGH THERE IS STILL 
NO OFFICIAL RESULT IN THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THE 
OPPOSITION M. D. C. SAYS ITS LEADER 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI HAS WON THE 
B. B. C.'S BANNED FROM ZIMBABWE SO OUR 
CORRESPONDENT PETER GRESTE JOINS US 
FROM THE COUNTRY'S BORDER WITH 
MOZAMBIQUE IS IT CLEAR WHAT 
ZIMBABWE'S POLITICAL FUTURE WILL 
BE 
ACTUALLY I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT BE AS CLEAR AS WE MIGHT LIKE TO THINK 
IT IS AS YOU MENTIONED THE 
OPPOSITION HAS TAKEN CONTROL OF THE 
PARLIAMENT WITH A MAJORITY IF YOU 
TAKE THE TWO FACTIONERS OF THE M. D. C. 
TOGETHER IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT 
WE ARE NOT SEEING THE M. D. C. 
SUPPORTERS OR PARTY CELEBRATING IN 
THE STREETS BECAUSE THE VOTE THAT 
COUNTS IS THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI IS BELIEVED TO BE 
THE NEXT PRESIDENT BUT THERE IS NO 
GUARANTEE OF THAT AT THIS POINT 
RULING THE RULING NEWSPAPER THE 
HER ARBLGSD WHICH IS SEEN AS A 
MOUTHPIECE FOR THE RULING PART HAS 
BEEN SAYING THIS MORNING ALTHOUGH 
THE OPPOSITION HAS WON THE MAJORITY 
OF PARLIAMENTARY SEATS THE ZANU P. F. 
TOOK THE POP OU LATTER VOTE 
THEY'RE SAYING IF YOU TRANSLATE 
THOSE VOTES ACROSS PARTY LINES AND 
SAY THAT ALL OF THE ZANU P. F. 
SUPPORTERS VOTED FOR ROBERT MUGABE 
THEN ROBERT MUGABE WOULD HAVE WON 
THIS ELECTION HE HASN'T WON ENOUGH 
TO TAKE THE ABSOLUTE MAJORITY BUT 
IF YOU DISTRIBUTE THE VOTES ACROSS 
THE PARTY LINES AND IF YOU DO SOME 
ELECT FOR AM MATH IT LOOKS AS 
THOUGH ACCORDING TO THE HERALD'S 
CALCULATION THAT ROBERT MUGABE 
COULD WIN A SECOND ROUND L. WANT TO 
STRESS THIS IS NOT OFFICIAL THIS 
HAS NOTHING DO WITH NUMBERS IT'S 
JUST THE HERALD NEWSPAPER DOING 
SOME SUMS THAT IS THE WAY THE 
HERALD IS THINKING 
THE ROLLING STONES ROCKED INTO 
LEICESTER SQUARE LAST NIGHT FOR THE 
U. K. PREMIERE OF THEIR NEW FILM SHINE 
A LIGHT AND HINTED THAT ANOTHER 
ALBUM IS IN THE PIPELINE THE FILM 
DIRECTED BY OSCAR WINNER MARTIN

THE APPRENTICE LAST NIGHT 
NOT AT 
ALL WE WILL HAVE THE LATEST 
EVICTEE ON THE SOFA AT NINE HUNDRED A M. 
IT'S A WEEK SINCE BAGGAGE CHAOS 
TURNED THE MUCH TOUTED LAUNCH OF 
HEATHROW AIRPORT'S TERMINAL FIVE INTO 
TURMOIL AT LEAST NINETEEN THOUSAND BAGS WERE 
MISLAID AS HUNDREDS OF FLIGHTS WERE 
CANCELLED REBECCA MURRAY IS A NEW 
MOTHER WHOSE BAGS ARE STILL 
MISSING MISSING GOOD MORNING TO YOU YOU GOT YOUR 
MOST PRECIOUS POSSESSION BUT YOU 
ARE MISSING ONE OR TWO OTHER 
THINGS 
YES WE ARE UNFORTUNATELY THINGS I'M KIND OF HOPING THEY WOULD HAVE 
TURNED UP BY NOW BUT NO JOY THERE 
NO INFORMATION EITHER 
SO THE STUFF 
THAT YOU NEED FOR LOTTY ISN'T 
THERE 
NO WE'VE HAD TO GO SHOPPING THERE BLESS HER AND GET HER AN ENTIRE 
WARDROBE HER LITTLE CASE IS 
SOMEWHERE IN THAT BIG PILE YOU HAVE 
WITHIN SEEING ON THE NEWS PRETTY 
MUCH EVERYTHING I OWN FOR HER I 
HAVE A COUPLE OF BABY SLINGS AND 
BABY CARRIERS MY ELECTRIC BREAST 
PUMP ALL OF THOSE BITS OF KIT ARE 
MISSING 
THE ISSUE FOR YOU IS NOT MISSING THE FACT YOUR BAG HAS GOT LOST BUT 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN IN 
TERMS OF PROCESSING WHAT YOU ARE 
TRYING TO DO 
YES WE WERE SUPPOSED 
TO GET TO ABERDEEN AT TWO HUNDRED P. M. ON 
THURSDAY WE GOT HERE AT NINE THIRTY P. M. WE 
FILLED OUT A FORM TO CLAIM FOR OUR 
LOST BAGGAGE L. DIDN'T CHASE IT 
UNTIL MONDAY BECAUSE I UNDERSTOOD 
OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS A BIG BACKLOG 
I THOUGHT IT WOULD TAKE SOME TIME 
ON MONDAY WHEN I WENT ONLINE TO 
SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING I WAS TOLD 
THAT MY CLAIM WAS NOT VALID OR 
HADN'T BEEN PROCESSED OR SOMETHING 
BASICALLY I SPENT HOURS AND HOURS 
TRYING TO GET THROUGH TO SOMEONE IN 
B. A. ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT I HAD TO 
FILL OUT ANOTHER FORM AND PRETTY 
MUCH GO TO THE END OF THE QUEUE 
THERE'S SOME RULE ABOUT YOU HAVING 
TO DO IT WITHIN THREE DAYS THREE THREE DAYS YEAH YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO 
PROCESS YOUR CLAIM WITHIN THREE 
DAYS THAT WAS DAY FOUR L. HAVE NO 
IDEA WHETHER IT'S VALID OR GOING TO 
HAPPEN OR NOT I'VE REALLY NOT BEEN 
GIVEN A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION 
HOWELL HOW LONG HAVE YOU SPENT ON 
THE PHONE WITH ALL OF THIS 
REBECCA 
FAR FAR FAR TOO LONG REBECCA LET'S JUST SAY I THINK ON MONDAY 
MORNING I GOT UP AT SIX HUNDRED A M. TO FEED 
LOTTY BY MIDDAY NO BY MIDDAY I 
WAS STILL TRYING TO GET THROUGH TO 
SOMEONE I GOT THROUGH TO SOMEONE 
IN CUSTOMER RELATIONS WHO WAS NICE 
BUT THEY COULDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING

TO SEE THAT LOTTY IS LOOKING SO 
MARVELLOUS THIS MORNING 
WITH ENOUS JULIA GEORGE SHE IS NOT 
ALONE IN THAT PARTICULARLY 
EXACERBATED BECAUSE SHE IS A NEW 
MUM WITH A BABY WHAT IS THE WHAT 
IS THE ADVICE FOR PEOPLE LIKE 
REBECCA 
REPORT THE FACT YOUR REBECCA LUGGAGE IS MISSING AT THE AIRPORT 
IF YOU DON'T DO THAT ANY CLAIM WILL 
BE MORE DIFFICULT PARTICULARLY IF 
YOUR LUG GODGE DOESN'T TURN UP AT 
ALL WHICH HAPPENS IN TWO PER CENT OF CASES 
THAT IS IMPORTANT AGAIN THE 
INFORMATION HE WAS GIVEN TO KEEP 
HER RECEIPTS IS CRUCIAL IN THIS 
PERIOD OF THE FIRST TWENTY ONE DAYS AFTER A 
BAG GOES MISSING IT IS TECHNICALLY 
DELAYED NOT LOST ALL YOU CAN GET 
BACK FROM THE AIRLINE IN THAT 
PERIOD IS REIMBURSEFUL FOR ANYTHING 
ESSENTIAL SO IN HER CASE NAPPY 
CLOTHES FOR THE BABIES AND SHE MUST 
KEEP RECEIPTS L. AM DISAPPOINTED ON 
HER BEHALF SHE WASN'T GIVEN MONEY 
UP FRONT IF SHE HAD HAD FOR IT SHE 
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GOT IT B. A. AND 
SOME OF THE AIRLINES OPERATE A 
FIRST NEEDS SYSTEM IF YOU NEED 
SOMETHING STRAIGHT AWAY THEY WILL 
GIVE YOU CASH UP FRONT 
SHE IS IN A 
PICKLE SHE IS TOLD THE ORIGINAL 
CLAIM IS INVALID BECAUSE SHE WAS 
GIVEN THE WRONG NUMBER SHE SPENT 
HOURS ON THE PHONE AND SHE THINKS 
SHE MAYBE PAST THE DEADLINE 
EVERYONE WHO HAS CONIN CONTACT HAS 
A STORY TO TELL AND THESE ARE HUMAN 
STORIES AND SOMETIMES THE AIRLINES 
FORGET THEY ARE INURED TO THE HUMAN 
DISTRESS THAT IS CAUSED WE HAVE 
HAD SO MANY INTO THE B. B. C. PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE GONE ON SKIING HOLIDAYS 
AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO 
ANYTHING HAVE WANTED TO COME HOME 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THEIR SPECIAL 
MA LAIR YA TREATMENT MALARIA 
TREATMENT DISAPPEAR AND ONE WONDER 
IF THEY WILL GET HOLD OF THOSE 
THINGS IT'S A DIFFICULT SITUATION 
AND THERE IS NOT MUCH GOOD NEWS 
ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT TO GET 
BACK DON'T SPEND TOO MUCH KEEP 
THE RECEIPTS KEEP IN TOUCH WITH 
THE AIRLINE BECAUSE NOW THERE IS 
DANGER YOU MIGHT COME BACK AND YOUR 
LUGGAGE HAS BEEN SENT ON TO WHERE 
YOU WERE DON'T GET YOUR 
EXPECTATION UP TO HIGH IS THE SAD 
MESSAGE THIS MORNING 
AND KEEP 
PLUGGING AWAY STILL TO COME SIR 
ALAN SUGAR FIRED A SECOND CANDIDATE 
SEE WHO IT WAS AND WHAT THEY HAVE 
TO I HAVE I THINK THEY WILL HAVE 
A FAIR BIT TO SAY ABOUT IT TOO 
THERE IS OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS 
AVAILABLE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO 
SPEND ON IMPROVING PLAY FACILITIES 
SO WHAT SHOULD THEY SPEND ALL THAT 
MONEY ON L. WILL ASK THE EXPERTS 
AND I AM IN LONDON'S NEW COVENT 
GARDEN FLOWER MARKET SURROUNDED BY 
MIMOSA FROM ITALY LILYS FROM 
HOLLAND AND CARNATIONS FROM 
COLOMBIA BUT VERY FEW BRITISH 
BLOOMS I WILL FIND OUT WHY IT 
KEEPS GOING HOT AND COLD WITH THE 
WER IT DOES WHY IS 
THAT IT IS 
IT IS STILL APRIL IT IS STILL 
EARLY ON YET AND WE ARE IN FOR A 
COLD SNAP AND TODAY IT IS NOT GOING 
TO BE COLD IT IS GOING TO BE MILD 
AND MOSTLY DRY SO THERE IS STILL 
SOME RAIN ROUND AND ALSO SOME 
DRIZZLE AS WELL NOW ON THE SAT LIT 
PICTURE YOU WILL SEE THREE NICE 
DIVISION IN THE EAST IT IS CHILLY 
BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT LOVELY BLUE 
SKIES HEADING DOWN IN THE 
DIRECTION OF SUSSEX AND HAMPSHIRE 
WE HAVE THICK ENOUGH CLOUD TO 
PRODUCE LIGHT OR PATCHY RAIN TO THE 
WEST GOOD BREAKS BUT SOME WORK A 
FAIR BIT OF CLOUD IN SCOTLAND WITH 
THE RAIN IN THE NORTH AND WEST 
BRAKES IN THE EAST ACROSS THE 
NORTH WEST WE ARE LOOKING AT 
DRIZZLY BITS AND PIECES AND THAT 
EXTENDS DOWN TO THE SOUTH OF 
ENGLAND TOO BUT A GLORIOUS START IN 
EAST ANGLIA LOVELY AND SUNNY 
WHIPPING OVER TO THE SOUTH WEST 
AGAIN THERE IS BREAKS SUNSHINE 
ROUND BUT THERE IS A BIT OF LOW 
CLOUD AND MURK COASTAL MURK 
SPECIALLY FOR THE SOUTH OF WEALS 
WE HAVE LOVELY BLUE SKIES BUT FOR 
THE REST OF WALES CLOSE TO THE 
COAST THERE IS A LOT OF CLOUD AND 
HILL FOG NORTHERN IRELAND THE 
CLOUD IS THICK ENOUGH TO PRODUCE A 
BIT OF DAMPNESS IN THE AIR SO THE 
BEST OF THE SUNSHINE TODAY IS 
GOING TO BE IN THE SHELTER IN THE 
EAST BUT EVEN IN THE WEST WE WILL 
SEE GOOD BREAKS AND CLOSE TO THE 
COAST THERE WILL BE A SEA BREEZE 
DEVELOPING BUT INLAND THERE WON'T 
BE TEMPERATURES WILL SCOOT UP INTO 
THE HIGH TEENS MAYBE NINETEEN ROUND 
EXETER AND SOUTHAMPTON TONIGHT 
THERE WILL BE FOG CLOSE TO THE 
COAST THROUGH THE ENGLISH CHANNEL 
AND YOU CAN SEE ACROSS SCOTLAND AND 
NORTHERN IRELAND A BAND OF RAIN 
COMING IN COOLER AIR BEHIND IT 
STILL MILE UD MILD AHEAD OF IT 
THAT BAND WILL PUSH SOUTHWARDS NOW 
BEHIND IT AGAIN SOME CLEARER 
CONDITIONS COMING IN WITH BREAKS 
SUNSHINE AND AHEAD OF IT A SIMILAR 
STORY IN AGAIN THERE WILL BE A 
FAIR BIT OF CLOUD BREAKS AND 
SUNSHINE BUT INTO THE WEEKEND IT 
WILL TURN MUCH COLDER NOTICIBLY 
COLDER AND SOME OF US WILL SEE SOME 
SNOW AND THAT IS HOW IT IS LOOKING 
THERE IS A LOT OF COOING GOING ON 
BECAUSE WE HAD LOTTIE UP IN 
ABERDEEN AND ANOTHER VERY NICE 
YOUNG MAN WHO EVERYBODY IS TELLING 
US IS MARVEL LOUSELY CUTE HE IS 
CHUCKING THINGS ROUND THE STUDIO WE 
SHOULD SAY N. THERE HE IS JOSHUA WE 
WILL TALK TO GRANNIES ABOUT WHETHER 
OR NOT THEY WANT TO BE NANNIES IT 
SHOULD BE CHILDS PLAY BUT IT COULD 
BE DIFFICULT TO ENTICE CHILDREN 
AWAY FROM TELL LIS AND COMPUTERS 
INTO THE GREAT OUTDOORS SO CHILDREN 
AND PARENTS ARE BEING ASKED WHAT 
THEY WANT JOSHUA IS GIVING HIS 
OPINION ALREADY LET US GO TO SARAH 
CAMPBELL IN BRISTOL FOR MORE GOOD 
MORNING L. AM LEARNING THE RULES OR 
RELEARNING THE RULES OF STUCK IN 
THE MUD WITH THE CHILDREN OF 
FONTHILL PRIMARY SCHOOL ARE WE 
HAVING GOOD FUN 
YES 
PLAY IS A FANTASTIC FORM YES OF EXERCISE MUCH NEEDED EXERCISE 
IT'S A GREAT WAY FOR CHILDREN TO 
BOND BUT IT APPEARS FROM EXPERTS 
THAT CHILDREN ARE LESS THAN EVER 
GOING OUT AND PLAYING UNSUPERVISED 
AND FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO FIND 
PLACES SAFE PLACES TO GO AND PLAY 
A NATIONAL CONSULTATION IS BEING 
ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT WILL SEE HOW A 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION POT OF MONEY CAN BE 
SPENT FOR LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO HELP 
IMPROVE AREAS ACROSS FOR CHILDREN 
LIKE THIS AND ONE OF THE MAIN 
PEOPLE THEY WILL WANT TO SPEAK TO 
TO FIND OUT HOW THAT MONEY SHOULD 
BE SPENT ARE GUYS LIKE THESE 
IN SCHOOL THE PUPILS NEED LITTLE 
ENCOURAGEMENT TO LET THEMSELVES GO 
BUT AFTER SCHOOL IN COMMON WITH 
CHILDREN ACROSS THE K. U. N. COUNTRY 
THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE ON THE 
COMPUTER THAN RUNNING ROUND OUTSIDE 
THERE IS A LACK OF GOOD QUALITY 
ACCESSIBLE LOCAL PLAY FACILITIES 
PART OF IT IS DOWN TO PERHAPS 
PARENTS PERCEPTIONS OF THE SOCIETY 
NOT BEING VERY SAFE ACTUALLY YOU 
HAVE TO SAY IT IS JOLLY GOOD FUN 
SITTING DOWN WITH A NINTENDO 
SOMETIMES IS THERE WILL IS A POT 
OF OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION AVAILABLE TO 
LOCAL AUTHORITY TO SPEND ON 
IMPROVING PLAY FACILITY AND IT IS 
HOPE OVER THE NEXT THREE MONTHS 
EVERYBODY FROM PLANNERS TO PARENT 
TO CHILDREN WILL ADVICE ON HOW THAT 
SHOULD BE SPENT WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PLAY 
AREAS BRISTOL IS SEEN AS ONE OF THE 
LEADING LOCAL AUTHORITIES WHEN IT 
COMES TO PROVIDING PLAY SPACES AND 
THEY SAY IT IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS 
EVERY LOCATION WE TALK TO CHILDREN 
THEY ARE THE KEY PLAYERS AND WE 
ASKED THEM THE TIME OF EXPERIENCES 
THEY WANT AS CHILDREN TO BE THERE 
DO YOU WANT TO SPIN ROUND DO YOU 
WANT TO BE FRIGHTENED DO YOU WANT 
TO BE UP HIGH WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE 
TO DO AND WE BUILD FROM WHAT THEY 
TELL US 
THE PUPILS AT THIS PRIMARY 
SCHOOL ARE ALREADY OLD HANDS AT 
DECIDING WHAT THEY WANT THEY 
DESIGNED THE STATE OF THE ART 
PLAYGROUND AND ARE FULL OF BRIGHT 
IDEAS 
I WOULD LIKE A 
TREE WITH A IDEAS TREE HOUSE IN IT SO WE COULD GO UP 
AND PLAY 
VERY BIG SWIMMING POOL 
WITH A ZOO ROUND IT L. LOVE ANIMALS 
A BALL PIT A SLIDER AND I WOULD 
HAVE RAM TRAMPOLINE WITH A 
SAFETY NET 
A DEATH SLIDE THAT GOES 
DOWN TO A BALL PIT SO NOBODY WOULD 
GET HURT SWIMMING POOLS AND A ZOO 
MAYBE AMBITIOUS FOR MOST PLAY AREAS 
BUT AS PART OF THE CONSULTATION ALL 
IDEAS WILL BE CONSIDERED AND WHAT 
FANTASTIC IDEAS THIS PLAYGROUND 
THOSE MOUND THAT WAS DIRECTLY CAME 
AS A SUGGESTION FROM THE PUPILS 
BECAUSE THEY WANTED RAISED AREAS 
IF I CAN FIND SOMEBODY TO SPEAK TO 
TOM YOU THINK IT IS IMPORTANT IN 
THIS CONSULTATION THAT YOU GUYS 
CHILDREN SHOULD BE ASKED WHAT PLAY 
AREAS SHOULD BE LIKE 
YES I THINK 
THEY DO 
YOU DO WHY DO YOU THINK 
THAT IS SUCH A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE BECAUSE KIDS KNOW WHAT THEY WANT AND 
ADULTS DON'T 
ADULTS DON'T IS 
BECAUSE BECAUSE WE WERE CHILDREN A 
VERY LONG TIME AGO YES 
HOW EASY DO YES YOU FIND IT TO FIND SOMEWHERE TO 
PLAY AFTER SCHOOL 
PRETTY HARD 
WHERE DO YOU TEND TO PLAY 
IN THE 
STREET OR UP THE FIELD 
A PERFECT 
EXAMPLE OF WHY MORE PLAY AREAS ARE 
NEEDED AND THAT IS A WHAT THIS POT 
OF MONEY IS ALL ABOUT SPENDING IT 
TO REALLY PUT THE FUN BACK INTO 
PLAY BACK TO YOU L. THINK I MIGHT 
GET OUT OF THE WAY IT IS QUITE A 
VICIOUS GAME THIS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
NOW THEY ARE BEING DUBBED GRANNY 
NANNIES GRANDPARENT WHO SPEND SEVENTEEN 
HOURS A MONTH LOOKING AFTER THEIR 
GRANDCHILDREN ACCORDING TO A 
RECENT SURVEY MOST OF THEM OFFER 
THEIR BABYSITTING SERVICES FOR FREE 
BUT MANY END UP OUT OF POCKET 
SPENDING TEN PER CHILD ON FOOD AND 
ACTIVITY SAGA INSURANCE SAYS 
GRANDPARENTS SHOULD BE COMPENSATED 
AND BE ENSTIETLED TO CHILDCARE 
VOUCHERS ENTITLED JOSHUA IS THE 
MOST CHEERFUL BABY WE HAVE EVER HAD 
ON THE 
PROGRAMME MARVELLOUS YOU 
ON THE PROGRAMME MARVELLOUS YOU ARE HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU SPEND 
WITH JOSHUA I HAVE HIM FOR A FULL 
A WEEK BUT IT ONLY SEEMS LIKE TEN 
MINUTES BECAUSE HE IS SUCH A GOOD 
LAD SOME OF THE TIME 
WHY DO YOU 
DO THAT DOES YOUR DAUGHTER GIVE 
YOU ANYTHING FOR IT 
NO I DON'T 
GET PAID BUT TO ENABLE HER TO GO 
BACK TO WORK I HAVE HIM ONE DAY A 
WEEK HIS OTHER NANNY HAS HIM A DAY 
AND HE GOES TO A CHILD MINDER FOR 
THE THIRD DAY 
AS YOU LOOK AFTER 
YOUR GRANDCHILD IT'S A FAMILY 
AFFAIR REALLY 
I THINK SO 
MY DAD 
CAME AND PUT UP SHELVES AND HE 
DIDN'T GIVE ME A BILL THINK MIX OF 
FAMILIES AND MONEY IS DAIFLT ONE L. 
DON'T THINK IT DOES THE GOVERNMENT 
ANY FAVOURS TO TRY AND INVOLVE A 
FINANCIAL SETTLEMENT IN WHAT IS A 
FAMILY ARRANGEMENT AND A NICE ONE 
I AM SURE GRANDPARENTS WHO LIVE 
MILES AWAY WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO 
BE NEAR ENOUGH TO LOOK AFTER THEM 
IT IS EXHAUSTING IT CAN BE VERY 
TIRING SPECIALLY WHEN THEY HAVE 
MORE THAN ONE IT SHOULD BE 
PLEASURE FIRST ONCE YOU INTRODUCE 
MONEY THERE IS RESENTMENT AND 
DIFFICULTY THAT WILL ENSHOE HOW HOW DOES IT WORK FOR YOU YOU HAVE A 
GRANDSON WHO IS COMING UP TO FOUR 
HE LIVES DOWN THE ROAD SO I AM 
POP IN TIME GRANDMA RATHER THAN BIG 
VISIT AND MUCH BUNTING INVOLVED 
BUT I SEE HIM A LOT AND I HAVE TWO 
KIDS STILL LIVING AT HOME SO SOPHIE 
CAN'T SAY SHE CAN'T GET A 
BABYSITTER THERE IS ALWAYS SOMEONE 
THERE 
DO YOU FIND YOU ARE OUT OF THERE POCKET THAT MUCH LOOKING AFTER 
JOSHUA 
NOT GREATLY BUT HE IS VERY JOSHUA YOUNG AT THE MOMENT SO HE DOESN'T 
TAKE A LOT OF LOOKING AFTER JUST 
KEEPING OCCUPIED BUT AS HE GETS 
OLDER YOU KNOW IT MAY CHANGE BUT 
CERTAINLY NOT 
YOU HAVE THE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR DAUGHTER 
WHERE YOU COULD SAY I WANT TO DO 
SOMETHING TODAY WHAT ABOUT TWENTY TO 
DO IT 
I COULD ASK WHETHER SHE WILL 
PAY IT IS ANOTHER THING 
YOU KNOW 
GRANDPARENTS CAN REGISTER 
OFFICIALLY FOR THE VOUCHERS BUT YOU 
HAVE TO DO IT OFFICIALLY AND BE 
PREPARED TO LOOK AFTER OTHER 
CHILDREN AS WELL AND HAVE YOUR HOME 
VETTED TOO EXACTLY 
IT IS A LOT OF EXACTLY TO GET OVER 
IT BECOMES A BUSINESS 
ARRANGEMENT WHICH MOST GRANDPARENTS 
WOULDN'T WANT THAT 
IT HAS AN 
IMPACT YOU TALK ABOUT IT IS QIED 
HARD WORK IF YOU DOING THIS ONE 
DAY AS WL IT HAS AN IMPACT ON YOUR 
LIFE AS WELL 
YES YES AND I AM SURE YES TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IT MUST SHOW UP 
THE FRACTURES IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THEIR CHILDREN IF YOU START 
FEELING RESENTFUL ONCE IT BECOMES 
A DUTY RATHER THAN OUT OF LOVE 
DIFFICULTIES ARE INVOLVED BUT I 
STILL THINK THERE IS AN AWKWARDN'T 
TO MAKING IT A FINANCIAL 
ARRANGEMENT WHICH WOULD MEAN THERE 
ARE PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE IT IS A 
VERY SHORT TERM ARRANGEMENT HE 
WILL BE IN SCHOOL SOON 
BEFORE YOU 
KNOW IT 
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH 
WELL DONE THANK YOU COMING UP

AT RISK FROM I. D. FRAUD WHICH IS THE 
FASTEST GROWING CRIME IN THE TWENTY FIRST 
CENTURY CENTURY IN A MOMENT WE WILL TALK TO SOMEONE 
WHO KNOWS WHAT IT IS LIKE TO GET 
THEIR IDENTITY STOLEN FIRST HERE 
IS A CLIP FROM TONIGHT'S SHOW THE 
TEAM WERE ON THE WAY TO TACKLE ONE 
OF THE BIGGEST GROWING CRIMES LAST 
YEAR ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE REPORTED HAVING 
THEIR IDENTITIES STOLEN 
I. D. THEFT 
HAS BEEN A CONCERN FOR YEARS IT 
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR THE 
BANKS AND I DON'T THINK IT WILL 
EVER STOP REALLY ONCE WE IDENTIFY 
ONE TREND AND PUT A STOP TO IT 
ANOTHER ONE STARTS 
THE TEAM ARE ON THE TRAIL OF GANG 
USING ONE OF THE OLDEST IDENTITY 
FRAUD TRICKS IN THE BOOK BOGUS 
LETTERS SAYING YOU HAVE WON 
LOTTERY PRIZE WHICH YOU CAN GET IF 
YOU GIVE YOUR BANK DETAILS THE 
CROOKS CAN MAKE MILLIONS 
USUALLY THE FRAUDSTERS WHO DO THIS 
PAY FOR THE STAMPS THEY PUT ON THE 
LETTERS WHICH ARE MAILED ALL OVER 
THE WORLD THERE YOU ARE JOINING 
ME NOW IS D. C. PAUL SHINGLES FROM THE 
CITY OF LONDON CRIME UNIT AND KATIE 
BAXTER WHO HAD HER I. D. STOLEN WE 
WILL TALK ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE IN 
A SECOND FIRST PAUL TELL US ABOUT 
THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM 
I. D. FRAUD 
IS GROWING IT IS DIFFICULT TO 
COMBAT IT WHAT WE ARE DOING IS 
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO TAKE AS MANY 
MEASURES AS THEY CAN TO PREVENT 
THEMSELVES FROM GETTING CAUGHT OUT 
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU AND WHEN DID 
YOU KNOW YOUR IDENTITY HAD BEEN 
STOLEN 
BASICALLY ABOUT FOUR YEARS STOLEN AGO ME AND MY HUSBAND MOVED OUT OF 
RENTED ACCOMMODATION ABOUT A YEAR 
AFTER THAT I STARTED GETTING DEBT 
COLLECTER'S LETTERS THROUGH MY DOOR 
WHAT HAPPENED WAS THE PEOPLE WHO 
MOVED IN AFTER ME OBVIOUSLY GOT MY 
NAME FROM SOME JUNK MAIL OR 
SOMETHING I THOUGHT I DID WELL 
REDIRECTING THE MAIL PHONING UP MY 
BANK CHANGING ADDRESSES AND STUFF 
OBVIOUSLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH THEY GOT 
HOLD OF MY NAME AND SET UP LOTS OF 
ACCOUNTS 
HOW BAD DID IT GET THERE ACCOUNTS THERE WERE FORTY DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS 
CATALOGUES THINGS LIKE THAT THEY 
TRIED TO GET CAR FINANCE BUT BY 
THAT TIME I HAD SUCH A BAD CREDIT 
RATING FROM ALL THIS THAT THINGS 
WERE GETTING DECLINED WHICH IS 
PROBABLY GOOD THING 
IS IT COMMON 
THAT SORT OF STORY 
YES IT IS ONE 
OF THE WAYS THEY OBTAIN INFORMATION 
FROM PREVIOUS ADDRESSES THERE IS 
AN AGENCY WITHIN THE BANK WITHIN 
THE INDUSTRY WHICH HAS BEEN SET UP 
WHO WILL HELP PEOPLE IN YOUR 
SITUATION WHERE YOU CAN CONTACT 
THEM WHEN THEY HAVE PROBLEMS THEY 
CAN FILTER AND THEY CAN ALSO ASSIST 
YOU IN TRYING TO RECTIFY 
WE HEARD 
ABOUT KATIE'S PROBLEM SOMEBODY 
TAKING OVER YOUR IDENTITY THERE IS 
THE ONE WE SAW IN THE CLIP JUST NOW 
YOU HAVE WON THE LOTTERY IN NIGERIA 
SORT OF THING YES 
WHAT ELSE YES SHOULD PEOPLE BE WORRIED ABOUT 
THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS OBVIOUSLY 
SHREDDING YOUR INFORMATION TO MAKE 
SURE IT DOES NOT COME INTO THE 
HANDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO USE 
IT FOR CRIMINAL PURPOSES ALSO HOW 
YOU USE YOUR CARDS AND HOW YOU 
GUARD YOURSELF WHEN YOU PUT YOUR 
PIN NUMBERS INTO MACHINES AND 
LIKEWISE WHEN YOU MAKE PURCHASES 
WHERE YOU ACTUALLY HAND OVER LOTS 
OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WHEN YOU 
BUY COMPUTERS THINGS LIKE THAT 
YOU ASSUME WHEN YOU GO TO A CASH 
MACHINE YOU ARE SAFE YOU HAVE SOME 
EXAMPLES HERE 
YES A COUPLE HERE 
THIS IS A FALSE FRONT THAT WE HAVE 
SO YOU WOULD ARRIVE AT YOUR CASH 
MACHINE THINK IT IS ALL FINE HOW 
DO YOU KNOW IT IS NOT 
YOU NEED TO 
LOOK AT THE MACHINE MOST MACHINES 
AROUND THE EDGES ARE QUITE TIGHT 
AND SEEM TO GIVE THE APPEARANCE OF 
BEING MOULDED WHEN THESE ARE PUT 
ON THEY LEAVE GAPS AND SOMETIMES 
SLIGHTLY LOSE WHEN YOU USE THE 
MACHINE AND CHECK IT IF THERE IS 
ANYTHING LOSE DON'T USE IT GO INTO 
THE BANK AND REPORT IT DON'T TRY 
AND TAKE IT OFF YOURSELF 
IT LOOKS 
AUTHENTIC ANYTHING ELSE THAT THAT USUALLY WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH A 
CAMERA BAR AS YOU CAN SEE 
FREE CASH WITHDRAWALS 
THEY HAVE 
MADE IT LOOK PART LIKE THE MACHINE 
BUT IT WOULD PROTRUDE FROM THE 
MACHINE IF YOU LOOK UNDERNEATH 
THERE IS A HOLE 
THAT GETS YOUR PIN 
NUMBER THIS GOES ON THE FRONT OF A 
REGULAR MACHINEMENT 
THEY WILL 
TAILOR THEM TO FIT THE APPROPRIATE 
MACHINE WHICHEVER BANK THEY WILL 
ALTER THE SIZE AND SHAPE THIS THIS HAPPENED TO YOU FOUR YEARS AGO HOW 
HAS IT AFFECTED YOU DOES IT AFFECT 
YOUR CREDIT RATING AND THE REST OF 
IT 
THERE ARE STILL A COUPLE OF THINGS 
ON MY FILE WHICH MAKE ME OUT TO BE 
SIXTY YEARS OLD AT THE TIME IT 
AFFECTED ME L. WAS JUST REALLY 
WORRIED AND ANGRY THAT THE PEOPLE 
GOT AWAY WITH IT 
THEY MADE A LOT OF EXTRA WORK FOR 
YOU 
YES LOADS OF EXTRA WORK YOU GOING BACK TO THE CASH MACHINE YOU 
REALLY TO COVER YOUR HANDS WHEN YOU 
ARE ENTERING YOUR PIN ANYWHERE ANYWHERE WHERE YOU ARE USING A MACHINE WHERE 
YOUR CARD IS INSERTED OR A SLOT 
THAT YOU PUT YOUR CARD IN ALWAYS 
COVER THE NUMBER WHETHER IT IS 
FROM PEOPLE BEHIND OR IF THERE IS 
POSSIBLY A CAMERA IN PLACE 
THAT'S RIGHT 
YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAMME IT IS ON 
B. B. C. ONE TONIGHT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
NOW HOW OFTEN DO YOU BUY A BUNCH 
OF FLOWERS YOU GET THEM ALL THE 
TIME TIME I GOT SOME THIS WEEK 
WE SPEND TWO POINT FIVE BILLION ON FLOWERS 
EVERY YEAR BUT DEMAND FOR BRITISH 
BLOOMS HAS BEEN WILTING BECAUSE WE 
ARE BUYING MORE CHEAP CUT FLOWERS 
FROM ABROAD 
GL ONE PART OF THE U. K. IS BUCKING 
THE TREND NARCISSI GROWERS IN THE 
ISLES OF SCILLY HAVE SEEN SALES 
BOOSTED BY TWENTY PER CENT OVER THE PAST YEAR 
HELLO IF YOU HAVE GOT TO START 
YOUR DAY EARLY THIS IS A GOOD 
PLACE TO BE NEW COVENT GARDEN'S 
FLOWER MARKET IS FILLED WITH WITH 
FRESHLY CUT FLOWERS 
THINGS 
FOR TEN YEARS AGO THE FIGURE FIGURE 
DROPPED TO QUARTER AND TODAY IT 
IS A LONELY ONE IN TEN OF THE 
FLOWERS WE BUY THAT THAT HAVE BEEN 
GROWN BY A U. K. FLOWER FARMER THEY 
SAY THEY ARE FACING COMPETITION 
FROM ABROAD AND RISING COSTS 
HAVE BEEN TO THE ISLES OF SCILLY TO 
MEET ONE GROUP OF FARMERS WHO HAVE 
MANAGE TODAY GROW ONE MILLION BUSINESS BUSINESS TWENTY EIGHT MILES OFF THE COAST OF CORNWALL 
BUSINESS AT AT CHURCH TOWN FLOWER 
FARM IS BLOOMING IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND 
ANDREW AND HIS WIFE HILLARY TOOK 
OVER TWENTY SEVEN ACRES ON SAINT MARTINS ONE OF 
THE ISLES OF SCILLY FAMED FOR 
GROWING SCENTED NARCISSI 
ORIGINALLY THEY PLANNED TO SELL 
FLOWERS TO WHOLESALERS BUT AS 
TRANSPORT COSTS ROCKETED THEIR 
BUSINESS WAS LOSING MONEY UNTIL 
SOME PASSING TOURISTS GAVE THEM 
FRESH IDEA 
WE WERE ASKED BY VISITORS TO THE 
ISLANDS COULD WE SPEND SOME FLOWERS 
BY POST SO YES WE COULD IT WAS 
SOMETHING WE WEREN'T GEARED UP FOR 
BUT WE DID START DOING THAT IN A 
SMALL WAY TO START WITH AND ONE OF 
THE PROBLEMS FOR US BY SENDING BY 
POST WAS THE FACT THAT WE ONLY HAD 
A POSTAL SERVICE ON THE ISLANDS 
THREE DAYS A WEEK 
SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER WITH MUCH IMPROVED 
POSTAL SERVICE AND A FLASHY WEBSITE 
SCENT FROM THE ISLANDS IS THRIVING 
EACH YEAR THEY SEND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND BOXES 
PACKED WITH OVER TWENTY FIVE MILLION 
MILLION FLOWERS DIRECT TO CUSTOMERS 
WE ARE NOT GOING THROUGH THE 
WHOLESALE MARKETS THEREFORE WE 
CAN COMPETE AGAINST FLOWERS BEING 
FLOWN IN FROM KENYA WE DON'T HAVE 
A VERY LARGE CARBON FOOTPRINT 
PEOPLE ARE MORE AND MORE AWARE OF 
THAT THAT BY BY CUTTING OUT THE MIDDLE MEN 
THE FUTURE IS LOOKING ROSY FOR 
CHURCH TOWN BUT IT IS NOT JUST 
ABOUT MONEY THERE ARE OVER FIFTY 
FLOWER FARMS ON THE ISLES OF SKILLY 
THE EMPLOYMENT ISLES OF SCILLY 
NOW AS MOST OF US JUST GETTING 
READY TO START OUR WORKING DAY 
TRADERS HAVE BEEN ON THEIR STALLS 
SELLING FLOWERS FROM MIDNIGHT JOHN 
HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS MARKET FOR 
TWENTY FIVE YEARS 
HOW HAVE THE FLOWERS CHANGED OVER 
THAT TIME 
TREMENDOUSLY A MASSIVE 
CHANGE OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS 
WHERE EVERYTHING WAS SEASONAL IT 
HAS BECOME ALL YEAR AROUND MOST OF 
THE FLOWERS YOU SEE AROUND YOU 
TODAY CERTAINLY SOMETHING LIKE 
THESE ARE FROM ITALY 
TODAY CERTAINLY SOMETHING LIKE THESE ARE FROM ITALY 
WHAT'S THIS EUCALYPTUS EUCALYPTUS THESE COME FROM ISRAEL 
THE TULIPS THAT YOU SEE ARE FROM 
HOLLAND HOLLAND WHY AREN'T YOU BUYING BRITISH 
FLOWERS 
BASICALLY THEY DON'T GROW FLOWERS THE QUALITY AND VARIETIES WE NEED 
THE DEMAND IS WE NEED FLOWERS ALL 
YEAR AROUND NOT JUST SEASONAL 
PLUS THE QUALITY THEY CAN'T 
PRODUCE PRODUCE O. K. O. K. SO WE HAVE GOT MASSIVE ORDERS 
COMING IN NOW WHERE WE DO ALL YEAR 
AROUND AND WE COULD NOT RELY ON 
ENGLISH GROWERS 
BILL YOU PLACED AN ORDER FOR A 
DOZEN RED ROSES I HAVE GOT THEM 
PUT ASIDE AND YOU CAN PAY ME LATER 
WE ARE JUST PRACTISING OUR C. P. R. 
IF YOU SAW SOMEONE COLLAPSE WOULD 
YOU RUSH TO GIVE THEM THE R. I. S. OF 
LIFE KISS OF LIFE 
CHEST COMPRESSIONS ALONE CAN SAVE LIFE LIFE IS IT TRUE DOES MOUTH TO MOUTH 
RESUSCITATION HAVE PLACE IN 
MODERN FIRST AIDING 
DOCTOR GERRY NOLAN JOINS US AND PETER 
IS A VOLUNTEER WITH SAINT JOHN'S AM 
BLANCE BLANCE GERRY CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THE 
AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION ARE 
SAYING AND WHETHER THEY ARE RIGHT 
OR NOT 
IN SIMPLE TERMS THEY ARE 
SAYING IF YOU WITNESS AN ADULT HAVE 
A SUDDEN COLLAPSE AND THEY ARE NOT 
BREATHING AND IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN 
TRAINED TO DO FORMAL C. P. R. THAT'S 
CHEST COMPRESSIONS AND MOUTH TO 
MOUTH VENTILATION AT THE LEAST YOU 
SHOULD JUST JUST DO CHEST 
COMPRESSION BECAUSE THAT WILL 
CIRCULATE ENOUGH BLOOD TO KEEP THE 
HEART AND THE BRAIN ALIVE 
WHAT DOES THE MOUTH TO MOUTH GIVE 
THE PATIENT ON TOP OF WHAT WELL WELL IT WILL PROVIDE AFTER THE FIRST FEW 
MINUTES THERE WILL BE A LACK OF 
OXYGEN IN THE LUNGS AND IT WILL BE 
IMPORTANT TO ADD OXYGEN TO THE 
CIRCULATION THE CHEST COMPRESSIONS 
TO KEEP THE BRAIN AND HEART ALIVE 
PETER YOU SAVED SOMEBODY'S LIFE 
SOMEBODY CALLED KEITH TELL US WHAT 
HAPPENED 
KEITH WAS ON HIS HIS WAY HAPPENED TO A SEMINAR AND COLLAPSED AROUND 
THE CORNER WHERE I WORKED THE 
MILKMAN KNEW I WAS WAS A TRAINED 
FIRS AIDER 
I RECOGNISE THE LAST LAST BREATHS 
AND HIS LIPS TURNED BLUE SO HE WAS 
IN CARDIAC ARREST WE COMMENCED C. P. R. 
AND ONE OF THE OTHER FIRST AIDERS 
GAVE THE MOUTH TO MOUTH CARRIED ON 
C. P. R. UNTIL FIVE MINUTES UNTIL AN 
ABLANCE AN AMBULANCE ATTENDED A 
PARAMEDIC ARRIVED ON SCENE AND GAVE 
THE VITAL DRUGS AND WITHIN MINUTES 
WE WERE ASKED TO SHOCK 
IF YOU HADN'T GIVEN MOUTH TO MOUTH 
WOULD HE HAVE BEEN SURVIVED THE THE MOUTH TO MOUTH WAS VITAL TO KEEP 
THE BRAIN ALIVE AND WITHOUT IT 
KEITH WOULD HAVE BEEN BRAINDEAD 
HE IS WELL 
HE IS BACK AT WORK AND WE E. MAIL 
AND WE KEPT IN TOUCH 
YOU MUST FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT YES YES VERY ELATED 
SOMEBODY COLLAPSES WHAT DO YOU DO 
IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN TRAINED IN C. P. R. 
ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT DOING MOUTH TO 
MOUTH AND SOMEBODY COLLAPSES AND 
THEY ARE NOT BREATHING NORMALLY 
YOU SHOULD CALL FOR AN AMBULANCE OR 
GET SOMEBODY ELSE TO CALL FOR AN 
AMBULANCE AND START CHEST 
COMPRESSIONS AND WE CAN DEMONSTRATE 
THOSE CHEST COMPRESSIONS 
I VOLUNTEERED 
WE ARE WE ARE GOING 
TO LOCK OUR FINGERS LIKE THIS 
IDEALLY THE PATIENT WILL BE ON THE 
FLOOR AND WE ARE JUST JUST DOING 
THIS FOR DEMONSTRATION IT IS A 
RATE OF ONE HUNDRED AND DEPTH OF TWO INCHES 
A RATE OF ONE HUNDRED PER MINUTE 
SRKS TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN 
TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN UP TO THIRTY 
AND THEN IF YOU WERE TRAINED GO ON 
AND DO YOUR RESCUE BREATHS 
TWONCHS OF TWO OF THOSE 
THIS IS THE BIT THAT PEOPLE MAY NOT 
BE TRAINED TO DO IF YOU ARE 
UNHAPPY ABOUT THAT OR NOT TRAINED 
THE COMPRESSIONS ALONE 
YOU ARE A BIG STRONG I AM NOT SO 
BIG OR STRONG THIS WOULD HELP 
SOMEBODY WOULD IT 
CERTAINLY ANY 
ADULT CAN DO THIS AND THERE IS 
EVIDENCE THAT CHILDREN OF TWELVE AND 
UPWARDS ARE COMPETENT 
THEY ARE ON THE FLOOR WHAT DO I DO 
INTER LOCK YOUR FINGERS AND AND 
STRAIGHTEN YOUR ELBOWS IN THE 
CENTRE OF THE CHEST AND PRESS DOWN 
THAT'S LOVELY AT ABOUT THAT RATE 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS 
TECHNIQUE AND THE LECK NEECK THAT 
OTHERS TECHNIQUE LEARNED WE WERE 
TOLD TO DO FIVE OR SIX AND ONE 
BREATH THIS IS MORE THE THE GUIDELINES CHANGED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE TO GIVE 
RELATIVELY MORE COMPRESSION BECAUSE 
WE WERE AWARE THAT PERHAPS 
COMPRESSIONS WERE MORE IMPORTANT 
HOW LONG WOULD I CONTINUE FOR IF IF YOU WERE DOING COMPRESSION ONLY C. P. R. 
YOU NEED TO CONTINUE DOING THAT 
UNTIL THE AMBULANCE ARRIVES OR IF 
THERE IS SOMEBODY WITH YOU AND THEY 
ARE CAPABLE TRY AND SWAP OVER 
EVERY TWO MINUTES 
THAT'S TIRING 
IT IS TIRING 
HE IS DYING NOW POOR CHAP 
THAT IS TIRING THE CRUCIAL THING 
IS AND IF IF YOU FEEL 
YOU WOULD DO THIRTY COMPRESSIONS AND 
TWO BREATHS IF YOU ARE NOT NOT 
HAPPY ABOUT DOING THE MOUTH TO 
MOUTH VENTILATION JUST DOING THE 
COMPRESSIONS AND YOU DO THOSE AT 
THE RATE OF ONE HUNDRED A MINUTE 
THE IMPORTANT THING IS REMAIN CALM 
I PANIC MYSELF BUT THE TRAINING 
KICKS IN ONCE YOU ARE IN THE 
RHYTHM YOU JUST KEEP GOING AND YOU 
KEEP GOING UNTIL YOU CAN'T GO 
ANYMORE OR UNTIL SOMEBODY ELSE CAN 
TAKE OVER FROM YOU 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
NOW HAVE A LISTEN TO THIS 
UP UNTIL THE POINT NO 
LET ME NO FINISH 
I TELL YOU WHAT I'M SICK FINISH AND TIRED OF LISTENING TO THIS 
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF ARGUING 
THERE IS ARGUING GOING ON HERE NOW 
AND ARGUING CAN'T BE CONSTRUCTIVE 
NO WONDER HE WAS SICK AND TIRED IT 
NEVER STOPPED DID IT AFTER ALL 
THAT WHO DID SIR ALAN POINT HIS 
FINGER AT 
I WOULD HAVE SACKED THE 
WHOLE LOT 
THEY WILL BE HERE AFTER NINE A M. 
CONTROVERSIAL CHOICE AND 
CONTROVERSIAL REACTION 
CAROL CAROL GOOD MORNING IT IS A PLEASANT 
START IN EASTERN AREAS AND FOR MOST 
OF US TODAY IT WILL REMAIN DRY BUT 
AS EVER THERE WILL ONE OR TWO 
EXCEPTIONS AND FOR MOST TODAY IT 
WILL BE MILD BUT THAT WILL ALL 
CHANGE AS WE HEAD THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND WEEKEND ON THE SATELLITE PICTURE IN THE 
EAST YOU CAN SEE THAT WE HAVE 
CLEAR SKIES THERE IS BEAUTIFUL 
SUNSHINE BUT WE HAVE GOT FAIR 
BIT OF CLOUD COMING ACROSS SCOTLAND 
THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND DOWN 
TOWARDS HAMPSHIRE AND SUSSEX AND 
THAT'S THE CLOUD PRODUCING THE RAIN 
OR THE DRIZZLE TO THE WEST CLEAR 
SKIES BUT ALSO MURK ACROSS 
SCOTLAND THIS MORNING QUITE A BIT 
OF CLOUD STILL THE RAIN IN THE 
NORTH AND ALSO THE WEST SOME RAIN 
IN THE EAST AND WE HAVE GOT DRIZZLE 
ACROSS THE NORTH OF ENGLAND 
THE CLOUD ELSEWHERE COULD PRODUCE A 
LITTLE BIT OF DAMPNESS IN THE AIR 
DRIFTING OVER TOWARDS THE SOUTH 
WEST AGAIN WE ARE LOOKING AT SUNNY 
SPELLS BUT THERE IS LOW CLOUD 
CLOSE TO THE COAST AND MIST AND FOG 
OFRT MOORS 
OVER THE MOORS HILL FOG AND SOME 
MURK AROUND CARDIGAN BAY AND INTO 
ANGLESEYMENT FOR NORTHERN IRELAND 
LOT OF CLOUD THICK ENOUGH TO 
PRODUCE JUST THE ODD BIT OF 
DAMPNESS DAMPNESS SO THROUGH THE REST OF THE DAY THE 
BEST OF THE BREAKS ARE GOING TO BE 
IN EASTERN AREAS WHERE IT WILL 
ABBEAUTIFUL DAY WITH SUNSHINE 
SUNSHINE DEVELOPING IN THE THE 
SHELTER OF THE WELSH MOUNTAINS INTO 
THE SOUTH WEST SEA BREEZES ALONG 
T. H. E. SOUTH COAST BUT INLAND 
THE SOUTH COAST BUT INLAND TEMPERATURES IN EXETER AND 
SOUTHAMPTON COULD GET UP TO NINETEEN 
CELSIUS THROUGH THE NIGHT THERE 
WILL BE FOG AROUND IN THE ENGLISH 
CHANNEL SOME MURK CLOSE TO THE 
WEST COAST AND WE HAVE THE RAIN 
COMING IN ACROSS SCOTLAND AND 
NORTHERN IRELAND BUT A MILD NIGHT 
FOR MOST OF US THAT RAIN BAND WILL 
CONTINUE TO CAREER SOUTHWARDS 
THROUGH THE NIGHT WITH COOLER AIR 
BEHIND IT AND FOR THE REST OF THE 
COUNTRY WE ARE LOOKING AT BREAKS IN 
THE CLOUD WITH SUNSHINE AND AGAIN 
TEMPERATURES UP TO SEVENTEEN CELSIUS 
CELSIUS OVER THE WEEKEND IT IS 
GOING TO BE COLD AND SOME OF US 
WILL HAVE SNOW SHOWERS 
HE WAS THE SECURITY GUARD WHO 
STRUGGLED WITH GETTING HIS WEIGHT 
AND CLOTHES OFF IN THE FULL MONTY 
BUT MARK ADDY REMAINS FULLY CLOTHED 
IN HIS ROLE ON STAGE AT THE 
NATIONAL THEATRE 
THE PLAY IS SET IN THE FROZEN 
ANTARCTIC AND MARK IS HERE YOU 
WOULD NEED TO WEAR YOUR CLOTHES IN 
THE ANTARCTIC 
THE ARCTIC IT IS A 
PLACE CALLED FRAM WHICH MEANS 
FORWARD IN NORWEGIAN IT IS THE 
NAME OF THE BOAT THAT WAS 
COMMISSIONED TO WITH STAND THE 
CRUSHING OF THE PACK ICE A LOT OF 
LEVELS MEN DIED BECAUSE THE ICE 
CRUSHES SO THE POWER IS SO INTENSE 
THAT THE BOATS WOULD JUST SPLINTER 
AND IT DEVELOPED A BOAT WHEN THE 
ICE CAME IN IT WOULD LIFT AND BE 
CARRIED ON THE ICE FLOES NORTH SO 
IT WAS A SO HE WAS A CLEVER GUY 
TWO EXPLORERS STARTS LIKE THE COMIC 
A LIMERICK 
IT IS NOT A COMEDY 
THERE ARE FUNNY MOMENTS BUT IT IS 
AN EPIC VERSE PLAY 
IT IS A NEW PLAY BY TONY TONY 
HARRISON AND IT IS ALL IN IN 
RHYMING IT IS ABOUT SURVIVAL NOT 
JUST SURVIVAL IN THE ARCTIC BUT 
SURVIVAL OF HUMANITY IN A WORLD 
THAT NELSON PREDICTED WOULD BECOME 
A GLOBAL ICE BOWL THE SUN WOULD 
DIE AND EVERYTHING WOULD BECOME 
LIKE THE POLE ALL IN A TIME OF 
GLOBAL WARMING THAT WAS HIS BELIEF 
UNTIL ABOUT THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS AGO 
I BELIEVE IT TO BE TRUE BUT YOU 
KNOW WAY AHEAD OF WHERE WE ARE NOW 
AND RHYMING CUPLETS YOU SAID 
YES YES HOW ARE THE AUDIENCES GOING TO COPE 
WITH THAT YOU GET USED TO IT YOU YOU DO DO AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES YOU KIND 
OF YOU ARE WAITING FOR THE RHYME 
YOU ARE WANTING TO FIND OUT WHAT 
THE RHYME IS GOING TO BE TONWRI 
TONY IS A GENIUS WRITER HE WRONG 
FOOTS YOU WITH WHAT THE RHYME IS 
BUT IT IS A STRICT METER FROM AN 
ACTOR'S POINT OF VIEW LEARNING SOME 
OF THE HUGE SPEECHES THAT HE WRITES 
I HAVE A HUGE ONE ABOUT CANNIBALISM 
WHICH IS GOSH GOSH PRETTY INTENSE BUT HAVING THAT 
FRAMEWORK OF RHYMING CUPLETS AND 
VERY STRICT METER IT HELPS YOU 
THE VERSE BECOMES YOUR FRIEND 
THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT TO WHAT 
PEOPLE THINK OF YOU WHEN THEY 
THINK OF CLINGFILM AND MARS BARS 
WELL YES YES I DIDN'T MANAGE 
TO 
AN ABIDING IMAGE PRESUMABLY TO YOU HAVE STRUGGLED WITH LOSING OVER 
THE PAST TEN YEARS

WE START PREVIEWING 
THE TENTH IT IS A LIMITED RUN IT

EXPECTED TO BE THE LONGEST AND MOST 
AMBITIOUS YET A DRY DAY FOR MOST 
OF THE DAY ISOLATED SHOWERS LATER 
ON 
WELCOME BACK THE TEAMS WERE LAST 
NIGHT ASKED TO RUN A LAUNDRY 
SERVICE THE GIRL'S TEAM ALPHA DID 
THEMSELVES NO FAVOURS LOSING THE 
TASK AND THEN BICKERING IN THE 
BOARDROOM BOARDROOM IN THE END WABWABWAB WAS THE LATEST 
VICTIM SHE IS 
IT IS A DIFFICULT DECISION THERE 
ARE GOOD REASONS FOR ALL OF YOU 
SITTING IN FRONT OF ME HERE AS TO 
WHY I SHOULD FIRE YOU YOU HAVE 
BEEN ACCUSED OF NOT CO OPERATING 
YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF SAYING YOU 
DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THINGS 
IT IS REGRETFUL YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO 
CONTROL THESE TWO PEOPLE HERE L. 
HAVE TO HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE I HAVE 
TO HOLD YOU FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR 
NOT BEING ABLE TO KEEP A TEAM IN 
PLACE I THINK THE MOST HEINOUS OF 
THINGS YOU HAVE DONE HERE IS YOU 
LEFT THAT LAUNDRY YOU LET YOUR 
COLLEAGUES THE DIFFICULTY IN 
IDENTIFYING THE PRODUCT YOU ARE 
FIRED 
IT IS NOT NICE SEEING YOURSELF GET 
THE BULLET 
ESPECIALLY WHEN I 
DIDN'T DESERVE IT CRINGE EACH TIME 
I HEAR MYSELF SAY PLEASE IT WAS 
MY LAST PLEA L. DIDN'T FEEL I 
SHOULD HAVE GOT FIRED 
WE WILL GO 
BACK OVER THE PARTICULARS OF WHAT 
WENT WRONG THINGS WENT WRONG ON 
THAT BUSINESS OF YOU GIRLS TRYING 
TO RUN A LAUNDRY 
IT WAS A CASE 
ONE SAID SHE WANTED TO BE A PROJECT 
MANAGER EVERYONE THOUGHT IF YOU 
ARE SO ADAMANT YOU CAN BE THE 
PROJECT MANAGER AS SOON AS WE SAID 
YES FOR THREE HOURS SERIOUSLY SHE 
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING SHE WAS 
COMPLETELY SHOCKED BY THE FACT SHE 
HAD PUT HERSELF FORWARD WE WASTED 
SO MUCH TIME TIME IS MONEY THE 
BOYS DID SO WELL IN THAT TIME THEY 
MANAGED TO GET THE IRON WHICH I 
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW 
SHALL WE LOOK AT 
THE DETAIL OF WHAT HAPPENED 
UNAWARE THE BOYS LOCKED AWAY THE 
IRONS SHARON'S PLAN 
HER PLAN IS TO GET BACK TO THE

WHERE ARE THEY WHERE ARE THE 
IRONS IRONS DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE STOLEN THEM 
THE IRONING BOARDS ARE NOT EVEN

WE UNDERESTIMATED THE BOYS THERE THEY TOOK IT PROBABLY HOURS AGO 
HOURS AND HOURS YOUR PROBLEM 
THOUGH WAS THAT YOU WERE IN CHARGE 
AT THE LAUNDRY MAKING SURE THAT THE 
RIGHT BITS OF CLOTHING ALL STUCK 
TOGETHER AND NOTHING GOT LOST CAN CAN I SAY I WAS NOT ALLOCATED THAT ROLE 
IT BECAME MY JOB BECAUSE I THOUGHT 
THERE WAS NO STRUCTURE IN THE 
LAUNDRETTE 
YOU WERE DOING WELL LAUNDRETTE AND THEN CRUCIALLY YOU LEFT 
I LEFT 
BECAUSE I CAME UP WITH A SUGGESTION 
THAT WE SHOULD GET THE IRONS 
BECAUSE WE HAD IRONS IN THE HOUSE 
WE KNEW WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO 
COMPETE IT 
IF YOU DID IT AGAIN YOU 
WOULD NOT MAKE THE SAME DECISION I I WAS TOLD BY JENNY SHE SHOULD HAVE 
SAID NO YOU ARE INSTRUMENTAL IN 
THIS SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW MY ROLE 
IN THE LAUNDRETTE SHE DIDN'T 
REALISE THE CONTRIBUTION I WAS 
PLAYING IN THE BOARDROOM SHE SAID 
SHE PLAYED NO VALUE OR NO 
CONTRIBUTION TO THE TEAM OBVIOUSLY 
I PLAYED A MASSIVE CONTRIBUTION I I LOVE IT YOU ARE HAVING NONE OF IT 
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FIRED 
EACH TIME I WATCH IT I LEARN 
SOMETHING ELSE YOU SHOULD HAVE 
SEEN THAT 
YEAH BUT LET ME GET A 
WORD IN YOU LEFT SO THAT MEANS 
ALL THE LAUNDRY GOT LOST 
BUT IT 
WAS LABELLED THERE WAS A SYSTEM IN 
PLACE I TOLD ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE 
THERE WAS A PROCESS 
HOW WAS IT YOU 
WERE UNABLE TO CONVINCE SIR ALAN OF 
YOUR INNOCENCE 
THAT WAS TWO HOURS 
IN THE BOARDROOM NOT A TWENTY SECOND 
ONE I DID REBUTT AND I DID SAY 
THAT JENNY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE WAS 
DOING SHE WASTED A CRITICAL THREE 
HOURS I DID NOT KNOW WHO MADE THAT 
DECISION OF FIVE THOUSAND THAT IS WHERE 
WE LOST THE TASK WE LOST IT 
BECAUSE OF THE COMMERCIAL CONTRACT 
FOUR POINT NINE NINE FOR EVERY ITEM FOUR POINT NINE NINE YOU CAN 
GET A PILLOW CASE FOR TWO 
THERE WAS 
A LOT OF BICKERING BLOOD ON THE 
FLOOR LET'S LOOK AT LUCINDA AND 
JENNY AT IT 
WHEN I HAVE TEAM 
MEMBERS DOING LUDICROUS THINGS IT 
MEANS I AM HAVING TO CONCENTRATE 
AND DIRECT A DISPROPORTIONATE 
AMOUNT OF MY TIME ON MANAGING YOU 
AND MAKING SURE YOU ARE NOT DOING 
STUPID THINGS 
YOU SAT THERE I I AM PROJECT MANAGER I HAVE NOT 
FINISHED 
PLEASE LET ME RETALIATE FINISHED ON THE POINTS 
YOU CAN FEED BACK TO 
ME WHEN I HAVE FINISHED YOU CAN 
FEED BACK TO ME IN A MINUTE WHEN I 
AM FINISHED O. K. UNDERSTAND 
NOT O. K. 
EXHAUSTING YOU CAN SEE I 
KNOW IT IS DIFFICULT FOR YOU THE 
OTHER SIDE OF THE DESK BUT THAT 
BICKERING AS WELL IN THE BOARDROOM 
YOU ARE USED TO THAT BECAUSE YOU 
COME FROM A FAMILY OF ELEVEN 
I COME 
FROM A LARGE FAMILY WE ALL HAVE 
DIFFERENT CONVERSATIONS GOING AT 
THE SAME TIME SIR ALAN WAS LIKE OH 
MY GOD WHN I WATCH THAT JENNY 
SHOULD WHEN I WATCH THAT JENNY 
SHOULD NOT HAVE BEHAVED IN THAT WAY 
WE WERE WORKING IN PAIRS L. HAD 
CLARE WITH MYSELF LUCINDA HAD 
HELENA SHE KNEW THE CONTRIBUTION 
SHE HAD MADE AND DID NOT STEP UP AT 
ALL THAT IS AWFUL WHEN YOU KNOW 
THERE IS THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOUR 
GOING ON YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING 
TO PREVENT IT 
THE GIRLS ARE NOT 
DOING WELL ARE THEY 
WE DIDN'T GEL 
WELL FROM THE BEGINNING BECAUSE OF 
THE PROJECT MANAGER 
DO YOU THINK 
OF THE GIRLS MAKE A CHANCE STAND 
A CHANCE OF GETTING TO THE END 
JENNY AND LUCINDA ARE LIVING ON 
BORROWED TIME 
JENNY STOOD UP FOR 
HERSELF IT WAS DIFFERENT IF 
SCHWEIGER HAD TAKEN IT BUT SHE 
DIDN'T 
YOU WANTED TO GO INTO THIS DIDN'T YOU APPLIED THREE TIMES ONCE ONCE BEFORE I GOT REJECTED L. THOUGHT I 
KNOW I AM BETTER THAN THIS 
ARE YOU 
BACK TO MOSAICS 
I AM IT WAS A 
TWO WEEK STINT BACK IN STRAIGHT 
AWAY 
THE EXPERIENCE THE AWAY THE EXPERIENCE ABSOLUTELY L. WISH I 
COULD HAVE STAYED LONGER L. WISH I 
HAD BECOME SIR ALAN'S APPRENTICE 
THAT IS WHAT I WENT IN IT FOR IT IT WAS A GOOD WATCH 
MY HEART BEATS 
EVERY TIME I WATCH IT 
NO BICKERING
