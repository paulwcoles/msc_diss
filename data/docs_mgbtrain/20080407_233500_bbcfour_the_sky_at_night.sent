WITH ANOTHER AGENCY THAT LOOKED AFTER BIG LABORATORIES ON THE GROUND 
LIKE DARESBURY AND THE DIAMOND LABORATORY NEAR OXFORD 
GOOD EVENING LATE LAST MONTH 
I OPENED MY DAILY PAPER AND THERE I SAW THAT 
TO SAVE MONEY THERE WAS A THREAT TO CLOSE JODRELL BANK 
OUR GREAT RADIO ASTRONOMY OBSERVATORY 
WITH THE TWO FIFTY F. T. LOVELL TELESCOPE 
I SIMPLY COULDN'T BELIEVE ANYTHING OF THE KIND COULD BE CONTEMPLATED 
AND WHO BETTER TO GIVE HIS VIEWS 
THAN THE ASTRONOMER ROYAL SIR MARTIN REES 
SO I WENT TO CAMBRIDGE AND THERE I TALKED TO HIM 
MARTIN IT'S GREAT OF YOU TO WELCOME US IN THIS WONDERFUL ROOM BUT JODRELL BANK 
WHY DID THIS OCCUR 
WELL WHAT HAPPENED ABOUT A YEAR AGO 
WAS THAT THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO REORGANISE THE WAY IN WHICH 
THE SO CALLED BIG SCIENCES WERE FUNDED 
THEY MESHED TOGETHER THE AGENCY THAT USED TO LOOK AFTER ASTRONOMY SPACE AND PARTICLE PHYSICS 
WITH ANOTHER AGENCY THAT LOOKED AFTER BIG LABORATORIES ON THE GROUND 
LIKE DARESBURY AND THE DIAMOND LABORATORY NEAR OXFORD 
AND IN SETTING THIS UP IT'S CLEAR THEY DIDN'T CONSIDER ADEQUATELY 
THE PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE EXPENDITURE AND COMMITMENTS 
FOR THAT REASON AND ALSO BECAUSE THERE WAS AN UNNECESSARY UPHEAVAL IN OTHER RESPECTS 
THE INITIAL EFFORTS TO SET PRIORITIES WERE CLEARLY CONTROVERSIAL AND WERE NOT HANDLED OPTIMALLY 
THERE WAS A BAD SITUATION IN NOVEMBER 
WHERE THERE WAS A THREAT THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GET OUT OF GEMINI 
BUT SOME OF THESE THINGS HAVE NOW BEEN SORTED OUT 
AND I HOPE VERY MUCH THAT 
DESPITE THE QUITE UNNECESSARY MUDDLE OF THE LAST FEW MONTHS 
IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO GET A CLEARER SET OF PRIORITIES 
TO CLOSE JODRELL BANK WOULD BE A DAMAGING BLOW TO SCIENCE 
I THINK IT'S CLEAR 
THAT INSTRUMENTS LIKE JODRELL BANK ARE ICONIC 
AND THEY HAVE AN IMPACT 
NOT ONLY ON THE U. K.'S IMAGE ABROAD 
BUT ALSO THE JODRELL TELESCOPE THAT WAS OPENED IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN 
JUST IN TIME FOR THE FIRST SPUTNIK 
HAS REMAINED STATE OF THE ART FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS IT'S BEEN RESURFACED 
AND IT'S RATHER WONDERFUL I THINK THAT AT THE MOMENT THAT GIANT TELESCOPE 
IS MAKING OBSERVATIONS OF AN AMAZING SYSTEM 
A SO CALLED BINARY NEUTRON STAR TWO NEUTRON STARS 
IN ORBIT AROUND EACH OTHER WITH AN ORBITAL PERIOD OF TWO HOURS 
AND THAT SYSTEM SHOWS THE EFFECT OF EINSTEIN'S THEORY 
IN MUCH GREATER PRECISION THAN ANY OTHER SYSTEM 
AND WITHIN THREE OR FOUR YEARS 
THAT SYSTEM WILL ALLOW THE JODRELL TELESCOPE 
TO TEST EINSTEIN'S THEORY TO 
AND IT'S RATHER WONDERFUL THAT FIFTY YEARS AFTER 
BERNARD LOVELL BUILT THIS VISIONARY PROJECT 
HIS TELESCOPE IS BEING USED TO PROVE EINSTEIN'S THEORY 
WITH A PRECISION FAR HIGHER THAN ANYONE THEN THOUGHT POSSIBLE USING OBJECTS 
NEUTRON STARS AND PULSARS WHICH NO ONE THOUGHT EXISTED FIFTY YEARS AGO 
IT'S WONDERFUL HOW THIS TELESCOPE IS STILL AT THE FRONTIER FIFTY YEARS ON 
IN THE WORST SCENARIO IF IT WERE AXED ON FINANCIAL GROUNDS 
MANY PROGRAMMES HERE AND ELSEWHERE WOULD COLLAPSE 
WELL IF JODRELL BANK WERE NOT TO CONTINUE 
OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD LOSE A GREAT DEAL OF OUR MOMENTUM IN RADIO ASTRONOMY 
WHICH WOULD INDEED BE AN OWN GOAL 
AND YOU'RE CONFIDENT NOW THAT THIS CAN BE AVERTED BECAUSE ASTRONOMY 
IS SUCH A VIBRANT SUBJECT AND WE HAVE SUCH A STRONG COMMUNITY IN THIS COUNTRY 
THERE'S ALWAYS A TUSSLE BETWEEN THE PRIORITIES OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS 
THOSE IN RADIO ASTRONOMY OPTICAL ASTRONOMY AND SPACE ASTRONOMY OF ALL KINDS 
AND UNDERSTANDABLY THERE'S A LOT OF BOISTEROUS DEBATE 
BUT I THINK IN THIS CASE THE PRIORITIES HAVE BEEN SET 
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMITTEES ARE NOW BEING RECONSTITUTED 
AND WILL BE RETHINKING THEIR PRIORITIES 
I'D BE AMAZED IF THE JODRELL BANK PROJECT DIDN'T END UP WITH A RATHER HIGHER PRIORITY NEXT TIME ROUND 
THANK YOU IT'S BEEN GREAT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT JODRELL BANK 
THANK YOU WHILE WE'RE HERE CAN I COME ON TO SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AND MUCH MORE REFRESHING 
THE GREAT GAMMA RAY FLARE THAT'S TAKEN PLACE A LONG WAY AWAY 
WELL THIS IS INDEED A REMARKABLE DISCOVERY 
GAMMA RAY BURSTS COULD I SAY 
ARE A KIND OF STELLAR EXPLOSION WHICH IS MORE SPECTACULAR THAN A SUPERNOVA 
IN A SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION THE CENTRE OF THE STAR IMPLODES 
AND THE ENERGY THAT'S RELEASED PERCOLATES OUT TO THE SURFACE OVER A FEW DAYS 
AND GIVES THE CHARACTERISTIC LIGHT CURVE 
IN THE CASE OF A GAMMA RAY BURST 
THE STAR IS SPINNING AND THE ENERGY RELEASED IN THE COLLAPSE OF THE CORE OF THE STAR 
SQUIRTS OUT ALONG THE ROTATION AXIS IN A NARROW JET 
AND IF YOU'RE IN THAT JET 
IF YOU'RE IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT'S POINTING 
THEN WHAT YOU'D SEE IS SOMETHING WHICH APPEARS ABOUT A MILLION TIMES BRIGHTER THAN A SUPERNOVA 
AND WHICH LASTS JUST A FEW SECONDS OR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN FADES AWAY 
GAMMA RAY BURSTS HAVE BEEN DETECTED OVER THE LAST DECADE 
AND SOME OF THEM ARE FOUND TO HAVE OPTICAL FLASHES ASSOCIATED WITH THEM 
WHAT HAPPENED WAS 
THE DETECTION OF A GAMMA RAY BURST 
WHICH HAD A MUCH BRIGHTER OPTICAL FLASH ASSOCIATED WITH IT THAN ANY BEFORE 
IT WAS QUITE REMARKABLE THIS GAMMA RAY BURST WAS DETECTED BY THE SWIFT SATELLITE 
AND THE BURST IS ABOUT SEVEN BILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY 
THE LIGHT'S BEEN TRAVELLING TOWARDS US FOR MORE THAN HALF THE TIME SINCE THE BIG BANG 
BUT THE OPTICAL FLASH FROM THIS OBJECT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST VISIBLE FOR THE NAKED EYE 
MAGNITUDE FIFTY FIVE AND THEREFORE 
THIS OBJECT IS NEARLY A MILLION TIMES BRIGHTER THAN AN ENTIRE GALAXY WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THAT DISTANCE 
AND A MILLION TIMES BRIGHTER THAN A SUPERNOVA 
IT IS AN AMAZING CHALLENGE TO US THEORISTS TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND 
HOW SOMETHING AS EXTREME AS THAT CAN EVER OCCUR 
IT'S ALSO REMARKABLE TO THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION OF THAT KIND 
IN OUR OWN GALAXY IN FACT IF THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION OF THAT KIND 
IN OUR GALAXY THE HISTORY OF THE EARTH 
THEN IF THE JET WAS POINTING TOWARDS US 
THEN EVEN IF IT WAS AT THE CENTRE OF OUR GALAXY 
TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND LIGHT YEARS AWAY 
THAT OPTICAL FLASH WOULD BE BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN 
SO QUITE AN EXTRAORDINARY PHENOMENON 
SOMETHING WHICH IS BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN BY SUCH A HUGE FACTOR 
WHAT'S THE LATEST NEWS ABOUT THIS LATEST BURST 
WELL IT FADED AWAY 
BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT ROBOTIC SMALL TELESCOPES WERE ABLE TO POINT TOWARDS IT 
WITHIN TWENTY SECONDS OF THE DETECTION BY THE SWIFT SATELLITE 
AND THEY CAUGHT IT IN ITS VERY BRIGHT PHASE 
THE BRIGHT PHASE LASTED ONLY A MINUTE OR SO 
IT THEN GRADUALLY FADED AWAY 
AND CAN STILL BE DETECTED 
BUT NOW IT'S FADED TO ABOUT EIGHTEENTH MAGNITUDE BUT BIG TELESCOPES 
CAN STILL OF COURSE STUDY IT GET THE REDSHIFT 
AND USE IT TO STUDY THE MATERIAL ALONG THE LINE OF SIGHT 
ANOTHER REASON WHY THIS IS SO EXCITING 
IS THAT WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO IS DETECT A SIMILAR OBJECT 
AT A MUCH GREATER DISTANCE 
BECAUSE OWING TO ITS GREAT BRIGHTNESS 
AN OBJECT LIKE THIS COULD BE DETECTED FAR FURTHER OUT IN SPACE 
AND THEREFORE FAR EARLIER IN TIME THAN ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN SEE 
AND YOU CAN CALCULATE THAT AN OBJECT OF THIS KIND WOULD BE DETECTABLE EVEN IF IT HAD 
A REDSHIFT OF FIFTEEN THAT MEANS IF IT WAS AT A THREE TIMES HIGHER REDSHIFT 
THAN THE MOST DISTANT QUASAR WE'VE NOW DISCOVERED 
AND IF WE WERE EVER LUCKY ENOUGH TO DETECT AN OBJECT LIKE THAT 
WITH SUCH A BIG REDSHIFT IT WOULD BE A UNIQUE PROBE FOR WHAT I CALL THE COSMIC DARK AGE 
THE ERA IN COSMIC HISTORY WHEN THE UNIVERSE LIT UP FOR THE FIRST TIME 
WHEN THE FIRST STARS FORMED AND THE FIRST GALAXIES STARTED TO ASSEMBLE 
WE HAVE NO PROBES OF THAT EARLY ERA BECAUSE OPTICS THERE ARE TOO FAR AWAY AND TOO FAINT 
BUT THIS AMAZINGLY BRIGHT BEACON WOULD IF WE DETECTED SUCH AN OBJECT THAT FAR AWAY ALLOW US TO PROBE 
RIGHT BACK TO THE BIRTH OF THE FIRST STARS THAT MAKES IT EXCITING 
IT SEEMS THERE ARE NEW DISCOVERERS NEW EVENTS ALMOST EVERY MONTH NOW 
AND THE MORE WE LEARN THE MORE WE REALISE THE MORE WE DON'T KNOW 
IT'S AN UNENDING QUEST AND THAT'S WHAT'S FASCINATING ABOUT THE SUBJECT THEREFORE I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY 
ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING AREAS OF ASTRONOMY HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE 
THERE'S ALSO HOPE NOW THAT THE JODRELL BANK HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE 
AND IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS' TIME IT SHOULD BE OPERATING JUST AS IT IS NOW 
I VERY MUCH HOPE SO 
MARTIN THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU 
LET'S TURN NOW TO THE MOST IMPORTANT BODY IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM 
OUR OWN SUN THAT WE HAVEN'T DEALT WITH FOR SOME TIME 
SO NOW IS A VERY GOOD MOMENT FOR TWO REASONS 
FIRST OF ALL THE SUN IS TO SOME EXTENT A VARIABLE 
THERE IS A WELL DEFINED CYCLE OF SOLAR ACTIVITY 
OF ABOUT ELEVEN YEARS IN LENGTH 
WE'VE JUST COME TO THE END OF ONE CYCLE AND WE ARE STARTING ANOTHER 
FOR THE FIRST ACTIVE AREAS AND THE FIRST SUNSPOTS 
SO IN THE NEXT YEARS WE MAY EXPECT 
MORE ACTIVITY AND MORE THINGS LIKE AURORAE SO A GOOD MOMENT 
SECONDLY THERE ARE TWO VERY INTERESTING PROBES ORBITINGTHE SUN 
ONE IS ULYSSES NOW COMING TO THE END OF HIS CAREER 
THE OTHER A STEREO NOW IN FULL FLIGHT 
WITH ME NOW TWO GREAT EXPERTS 
DOCTORS TIM HORBURY AND CHRIS DAVIS 
WELCOME TO THE SKY AT NIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU 
MAY I COME FIRST TO YOU TIM ULYSSES 
YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED ALL THE WAY THROUGH CAN YOU GIVE US A RUN DOWN ON ULYSSES WHAT IT'S DOING 
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING TO IT NOW 
SURE ULYSSES WAS LAUNCHED IN NINETEEN NINETY 
AND IT'S A SPACECRAFT TO STUDY THE SUN AND IN PARTICULAR 
THE HOT IONISED PLASMA COMING OFF THE SUN CALLED THE SOLAR WIND 
ULYSSES IS IN A POLAR ORBIT SO IT TRAVELS OVER THE POLES OF THE SUN 
THE SOUTH POLE AND THE NORTH POLE 
BECAUSE IT WAS REALISED VERY EARLY ON THAT CONDITIONS ARE GOING TO BE 
DIFFERENT OVER THE POLES OF THE SUN THAN AT LOW LATITUDES 
ULYSSES HAS REALLY SHOWN THAT THAT IS THE CASE 
OF COURSE ULYSSES SADLY IS NOW COMING TO THE END OF ITS CAREER 
THAT'S RIGHT IT'S LASTED OVER SEVENTEEN YEARS NOW 
BUT THE POWER IS GRADUALLY REDUCING IN THE SPACECRAFT AND SO IT'S GETTING VERY COLD 
IN PARTICULAR THE FUEL IS LIKELY TO FREEZE IN THE FUEL LINES 
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS THE SPACECRAFT WON'T BE ABLE TO POINT ITS ANTENNAE AT THE EARTH 
AND WE'LL LOSE COMMUNICATIONS WITH IT WE DID A PROGRAMME ABOUT IT AND I WAS THERE 
AND I COULD HAVE DONE BUT DIDN'T ACTUALLY TOUCH IT I THOUGHT THAT THING IS MEANT TO BE FAR AWAY 
AND WILL NEVER COME BACK IT'S A GREAT SHAME TO ME THAT I NEVER DID TOUCH IT 
BECAUSE IT LAUNCHED BEFORE I STARTED MY P. H. D. SO I NEVER GOT TO SEE IT 
AND WHAT'S ULYSSES ACTUALLY DONE 
IT'S MEASURED THE SOLAR WIND PROPERTIES AND COSMIC RAYS OVER THE POLES OF THE SUN 
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT NEAR SOLAR MINIMUM WHERE WE ARE NOW WITH VERY FEW SUNSPOTS 
WE KNOW THE SUN'S MAGNETIC FIELD IN THAT CASE IS RATHER SIMPLE LIKE A BAR MAGNET 
IT'S LIKE THE EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD AS WELL SO IT'S GOT A NORTH AND A SOUTH POLE IN THAT SITUATION 
OVER THE POLES OF THE SUN THERE ARE MAGNETIC FIELD LINES 
WHICH COME OUT EASILY INTO SPACE 
THE HOT ATMOSPHERE OF THE SUN THE CORONA AT A MILLION OR SO DEGREES 
CAN THEN VERY EASILY TRAVEL ALONG THOSE MAGNETIC FIELD LINES AND OUT INTO INTERPLANETARY SPACE 
THAT RESULTS IN A VERY FAST STEADY SOLAR WIND OVER THE POLES OF THE SUN 
AT LOW LATITUDES WHERE WE ARE THE SUN'S MAGNETIC FIELD IS MUCH MORE CLOSED AND MUCH MORE COMPLEX 
AS A RESULT THE SOLAR WIND THAT COMES OUT IS SLOWER AND MORE VARIABLE 
IT'S CERTAINLY DONE MARVELLOUS THINGS NOW ON TO STEREO A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF PROBE 
NOW IN FULL FLOW CHRIS WHAT ABOUT STEREO CAN YOU GIVE US A RUN DOWN ON THAT 
STEREO IS A MISSION THAT WAS LAUNCHED IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SIX 
IT'S A NASA MISSION WHICH IS SENDING TWO SPACECRAFTS OUT 
IN EARTH LIKE ORBITS ONE AHEAD OF THE EARTH AND ONE BEHIND 
THESE TWO SPACECRAFTS LOOK BACK AT THE SUN AND FROM THEIR ADVANTAGE POINTS 
TWO SEPARATE POINTS IN SPACE THEY ARE ABLE TO IMAGE THE SURFACE OF THE SUN IN THREE D. 
THE SURFACE OF THE SUN IS VERY COMPLICATED 
IT'S THREADED WITH ALL KINDS OF MAGNETIC FIELD STRUCTURES 
AND IT'S A FLUID SO THERE'S CONSTANT MOTION OF MATERIAL 
WE'RE INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT WHAT CAUSES THESE SHAPES TO CHANGE 
AND HOW THE MAGNETIC FIELD EVOLVES ON THE SUN IF YOU'VE GOT TWO SPACECRAFTS 
YOU CAN GET A THREE DIMENSIONAL VIEW OF THIS 
AND THAT HELPS YOU WORK OUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
SOMETHING MOVING AND SOMETHING CHANGING SHAPE 
IF YOU CAN WORK OUT THE ORIENTATION OF THESE STRUCTURES IT'S WORKING WELL VERY WELL YES 
WE'VE BEEN IN SCIENCE OPERATIONS 
AS WELL AS THE SUNWARD POINTING TELESCOPES 
THERE ARE INSTRUMENTS ON BOARD WHICH TASTE THE SOLAR WIND 
THEY CAN MEASURE THE PARTICLES COMING OUT FROM THE SUN 
THE U. K. PROVIDED ONE OF THE PAIRS OF INSTRUMENTS ONE ON EACH OF THE SPACECRAFTS 
KNOWN AS THE HELIOSPHERIC IMAGER AND THIS IS A LIFE SIZE MODEL 
AND IT'S AN AMAZING PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY IT WAS BUILT IN THE U. K. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM 
IT'S MOUNTED ON THE SIDE OF THE SPACECRAFT AND THE TECHNOLOGY INVOLVED IS QUITE INCREDIBLE 
IT POINTS JUST OFF THE SUN SO THE SUN IS JUST OUTSIDE THE FIELD OF VIEW 
BUT THE TWO CAMERAS YOU SEE INSIDE HERE ARE MEASURING THE SPACE BETWEEN THE SUN AND THE EARTH 
WHERE ARE THE CAMERAS THERE ARE TWO ONE HERE 
WHICH LOOKS JUST OFF THE EDGE OF THE SUN 
IT'S A TWENTY DEGREE FIELD OF VIEW AND THERE'S ANOTHER CAMERA BURIED DEEP DOWN INSIDE THERE 
WITH A SEVENTY DEGREE FIELD OF VIEW SO BETWEEN THEM THEY CAN LOOK BACK 
BETWEEN THE SUN AND THE EARTH AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING 
IN THE SOLAR WIND THAT'S COMING OUR WAY 
THESE CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS A VERY EXCITING THING 
WHAT IS A C. M. E. 
A C. M. E. IS AN EXPLOSION OF HOT PLASMA WHICH IS AN ELECTRIFIED GAS 
AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE PLASMA BALL BEHIND YOU THERE EACH ONE OF THESE EXPLOSIONS 
CONTAINS ABOUT A BILLION TONNES OF MATERIAL 
TRAVELLING AT A MILLION MILES AN HOUR 
SO THEY'RE VERY VIOLENT PHENOMENA 
WE'RE INTERESTED IN TRACKING WHERE THOSE GO IN SPACE THE TECHNOLOGY 
INVOLVED IN THIS IS QUITE INCREDIBLE BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE SOMETHING 
THAT'S ONE HUNDRED MILLION MILLION TIMES FAINTER THAN THE SUN SO ALL THESE BAFFLES 
THESE RIDGES ON HERE ARE DESIGNED TO CUT DOWN THE SCATTERED LIGHT FROM THE SUN ITSELF 
IF YOU'RE A PHOTOGRAPHER AND YOU'RE TAKING A PHOTOGRAPH INTO THE SUN YOU'LL REALISE 
HOW TECHNICALLY CHALLENGING THAT IS BECAUSE YOU GET 
ALL KINDS OF REFLECTION INSIDE THE CAMERA 
AND THIS CUTS DOWN THE SCATTERED LIGHT SO WE CAN ACTUALLY MEASURE 
THESE VERY FAINT CLOUDS AS THEY COME INTO SPACE 
IF YOU'VE GOT TWO SPACECRAFTS 
YOU'RE ABLE TO WORK OUT THE SPEED AND DIRECTION SO FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME 
WE'RE STARTING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ACCURATE SPACE WEATHER FORECASTS 
WE CAN GIVE ADVANCE WARNING OF WHERE THESE CLOUDS ARE GOING 
AND IN WHAT DIRECTION 
WHICH HAS OBVIOUS USES IF WE'RE STARTING TO EXPLORE THE SOLAR SYSTEM 
HAVING MAN BASES AND A MAN MISSION TO MARS 
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO KNOW WHERE THESE VIOLENT EXPLOSIONS ARE HEADING 
HOW LONG WILL STEREO LAST STEREO IS DESIGNED 
TO LAST ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS THE TWO SPACECRAFTS ARE DRIFTING AWAY FROM THE EARTH 
AT ABOUT HALF A MILLION MILES A YEAR SO THEY ARE CONSTANTLY 
MOVING AWAY IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SEND THESE SPACECRAFTS OUT AND THEN STOP THEM 
THAT REQUIRES TOO MUCH FUEL SO AFTER ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS 
THEY'LL BE FORMING AN ANGLE OF NINETY ABOUT DEGREES WITH THE SUN AT THE MIDDLE 
THERE'S A POSSIBLE MISSION EXTENSION WHICH WOULD SEE THE SPACECRAFTS ROUND TO BE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES APART 
AND WE WOULD BE ABLE TO IMAGE THE WHOLE SUN FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THEY'RE SENDING BACK AMAZING PICTURES THEY ARE 
WE'RE SEEING FANTASTIC IMAGES OF THESE MASS EJECTIONS 
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT CAUSES THEM TO BE TRIGGERED 
AND TO MOVE INTO SPACE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES 
OF HAVING THREE DIMENSIONAL IMAGES IS THAT WE CAN NOW 
START TO UNDERSTAND WHAT CAUSES THESE MASS EJECTIONS TO BE LAUNCHED 
AND THE SHAPES WE'RE SEEING THE WAY THEY MOVE AND EVOLVE 
AS THEY COME AWAY FROM THE SUN IS HELPING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS 
AS TO WHICH OF THE THEORIES IS RIGHT 
ABOUT THE FORMATION OF THESE MASS EJECTIONS 
WE'RE LEARNING ALL ABOUT THE SUN WITH THESE PROBES 
ALSO WE HAD A GREAT COMET COMET MCNAUGHT 
YES IN FACT IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE SAW 
WHEN WE OPENED THE DOOR OF ONE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS COMET MCNAUGHT 
THIS MAGNIFICENT FEATHERY TAIL WHICH TELLS US A LOT ABOUT THE ELEMENTS IN THE TAIL 
WE'VE ALSO SEEN COMET MACHHOLZ ORBITINGTHE SUN 
WITH A BEAUTIFUL DUST TAIL BUT I THINK THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN 
WAS COMET ENCKE AS IT CAME IN TOWARDS THE SUN 
A MASS EJECTION WENT OFF AND IT RIPPED THE TAIL OFF THIS COMET 
AND HOW COMETS INTERACT WITH THE SOLAR WIND IS A REALLY GRAPHIC EXAMPLE 
OF HOW THE SOLAR WIND CAN AFFECT OBJECTS IN SPACE 
ENCKE IS AN OLD FRIEND IT WASN'T PERMANENTLY DAMAGED NO IT WASN'T BUT YOU COULD SEE THAT 
THIS TAIL ACTUALLY DISCONNECTED AS THE C. M. E. WENT OVER THE TOP OF IT 
WE'VE SEEN THOSE KIND OF DISCONNECTION EVENTS BEFORE 
BUT WE'VE NEVER SEEN A C. M. E. GO OVER THE TOP OF IT TO CAUSE 
THE DISCONNECTION SO THAT'S WHAT'S LOVELY ABOUT THIS 
WITH THESE OBSERVATIONS YOU CAN SEE THESE TAILS CAN SOMETIMES BE QUITE LONG 
WITH ULYSSES WE SAW HOW LONG THEY CAN BE 
IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX ULYSSES PASSED BY CHANCE THROUGH THE TAIL OF COMET HYAKUTAKI 
WHICH WAS VERY BRIGHT A LOVELY COMET IT WAS SPECTACULAR 
ULYSSES PASSED THROUGH THE TAIL ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION KILOMETRES DOWN TAIL 
A HUGE DISTANCE MUCH FURTHER THAN WE ARE FROM THE SUN FOR EXAMPLE 
WITH ULYSSES WE REALISED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THESE COMET TAILS 
CAN ACTUALLY ESSENTIALLY LAST THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR WIND 
AS IT GOES TOWARDS THE TERMINATION SHOCK AROUND ONE HUNDRED TIMES WE ARE FROM THE SUN 
COMET TAILS SEEM TO BE THESE VERY COHERENT OBJECTS 
WHICH PROBABLY ARE SOME OF THE LARGEST IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM 
THEY STRETCH RIGHT OUT TO THE FAR EDGES OF THE DEPTHS OF SPACE 
WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE SUN WITH THESE PROBES BUT ALSO ABOUT THE PLANETS 
YES WELL STEREO WAS DESIGNED TO MEASURE THESE MASS EJECTIONS 
BUT WE OFTEN SEE MERCURY AND VENUS 
IN FACT YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE THE STEREO IMAGES 
TO SHOW THE PLANETS DO ACTUALLY MOVE ROUND THE SUN 
WE'VE REPROVED A FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH THERE 
WE ALSO SEE THE MASS EJECTIONS IMPACTING THESE PLANETS 
WE'VE GOT OBSERVATIONS OF MASS EJECTIONS WHICH HAVE MOVED ACROSS VENUS 
WE'VE MEASURED THOSE IN SITU WITH VENUS EXPRESS 
WE CAN ALSO SEE THESE MASS EJECTIONS COMING TOWARDS THE EARTH 
OF COURSE THAT'S VERY USEFUL FOR US 
THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE GIVES US ADVANCE WARNING 
OF ANYTHING THAT'S CHANGING WITHIN OUR SPACE ENVIRONMENT 
THAT HELPS US TO PROTECT EARTH ORBITING SATELLITES 
AND ASTRONAUTS IN SPACE AT THE TIME 
WHAT OTHER RESULTS FOR EXAMPLE STARS 
YES WE'VE GOT VERY WIDE FIELD CAMERAS IN SPACE EXACTLY 
WE'RE IN A VERY PRIVILEGED POSITION BECAUSE 
THEY DRIFT THROUGH A FIELD OF VIEW OVER A MATTER OF WEEKS 
WE'RE TAKING IMAGES OF SOMETHING LIKE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND STARS AT A TIME 
AND WE CAN OBSERVE THEM FOR TWO OR THREE WEEKS 
IF YOU ASK AN ASTRONOMER 
HOW EASY IT WOULD BE TO GET THREE WEEKS OBSERVING TIME 
UNINTTERUPTED OBSERVING TIME ON A TELESCOPE 
THEY WOULD PROBABLY LAUGH OR CRY THEY WOULD 
WE CAN DO THIS FOR ALL OF THE STARS DOWN TO ABOUT THIRTEENTH MAGNITUDE 
GLENN WHITE AT THE OPEN UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN WORKING 
TO TRACK THESE STARS AND TO LOOK AT THE LIGHT CURVES 
FOR EACH OF THESE STARS WE CAN SEE ECLIPSING BINARIES 
WE CAN SEE VARIABLE STARS AND THE INTENTION AND THE HOPE IS 
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO START LOOKING FOR EXTRA SOLAR PLANETS WITH THIS 
BEFORE WE BEGAN THIS PROGRAMME 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AMATEUR PARTICIPATION 
YOU HAVE AN AMATEUR WHO WANTS TO BECOME INVOLVED 
HOW DOES HE GO ABOUT IT CHRIS 
AT THE MOMENT WE'VE GOT ALL THE IMAGES AND MOVIES AVAILABLE ONLINE 
ON THE STEREO HI WEBSITE I CAN GIVE YOU THE ADDRESS 
ON THAT WEBSITE YOU'LL SEE ALL THE MOVIES 
AND HOW TO ACCESS THE IMAGES AND THEN 
IF PEOPLE WANT TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIND ANYTHING IN THE IMAGES THAT WE HAVEN'T NOTICED 
THEY SHOULD DOWNLOAD THE IMAGES AND LIKE PLANET HUNTERS DID YEARS AGO 
YOU TAKE TWO IMAGES NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND COMPARE REGIONS OF THEM 
IF YOU SEE ANYTHING MOVING THEN IT'S NOT A STAR 
SO IN THOSE IMAGES THERE ARE ASTEROIDS 
AND THE POTENTIAL OF NEAR EARTH OBJECTS AND THOSE TAKE REAL HUNTING OUT 
IT'S EASY ENOUGH IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO LOOK 
TO SEE THESE VERY FAINT TRAILS 
THE ADVANTAGE OF STEREO IT'S LOOKING BETWEEN THE SUN AND EARTH 
IT CAN DO THINGS GROUND BASED OBSERVERS CAN'T YES 
THE SUN WOULD BE IN THE FIELD OF VIEW MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SEE 
WE ARE IMAGING A REGION OF SPACE 
WHICH IS VERY DIFFICULT TO IMAGE FROM THE EARTH 
IF PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE OUR IMAGES 
AND LOOK FOR OBJECTS THAT HAVEN'T PREVIOUSLY BEEN SEEN 
THEN THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY THERE 
SOMETHING INTERESTS ME PARTICULARLY VULCANOID ASTEROIDS 
ASTEROIDS SOMEWHERE NEAR MERCURY 
NO VULCANOIDS HAVE BEEN FOUND BUT THEY COULD EXIST 
WE CERTAINLY SEE MERCURY IN OUR FIELD OF VIEW 
IF THESE ASTEROIDS EXIST AND ARE OF A SUFFICIENT MAGNITUDE 
WE WILL SEE THEM 
LET US ANNOUNCE A SKY AT NIGHT MEDAL 
TO BE WON BY THE FIRST MAN OR WOMAN WHO DISCOVERS A VULCANOID ASTEROID 
SOUNDS LIKE A VERY EXCITING CHALLENGE ABSOLUTELY 
WELL NOW WHAT OF THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE 
ULYSSES SADLY IS NEAR THE END STEREO'S NOT 
WHAT DO YOU HOPE FOR IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS TIM 
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS 
I THINK WE SHOULD BE MAKING PROGRESS 
UNDERSTANDING HOW CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS AND THE MAGNETIC FIELDS THEY CARRY WITH THEM 
MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR AFFECTING THE SOLAR CYCLE 
SOMETHING THAT'S VERY EXCITING THAT'S BEEN COMING UP RECENTLY 
IS THE IDEA CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS 
PLAY A KEY ROLE IN CHANGING THE SOLAR CYCLE 
WE SEE THE NUMBER OF SUNSPOTS CHANGING FROM A FEW 
LIKE WE HAVE NOW AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CYCLE 
WHEN THE SUN'S MAGNETIC FIELD IS RATHER SIMPLE 
WHEN THERE ARE LOTS OF SUNSPOTS THE SUN'S MAGNETIC FIELD IS TANGLED 
IT'S A SYMPTOM OF THAT 
ABOUT FIVE YEARS LATER WE GO BACK TO SOLAR MINIMUM 
AT THAT POINT THE SUN'S MAGNETIC FIELD HAS FLIPPED 
FROM ONE POLARITY TO THE OTHER 
AS THESE CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS GET RELEASED OFF THE SUN 
THEY CERTAINLY CARRY MAGNETIC FIELDS WITH THEM 
AND IT SEEMS THEY'RE PLAYING A KEY ROLE MOVING THE MAGNETIC FIELDS 
UP TO THE HIGH LATITUDES TO REVERSE THE SUN'S MAGNETIC FIELD 
IT MIGHT BE THAT CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS ARE PLAYING A KEY ROLE 
IN DETERMINING THAT ELEVEN YEAR TIMESCALE OF THE SOLAR DYNAMO AND THE SOLAR MAGNETIC FIELD REVERSAL 
WHAT ABOUT YOU 
I'M MOST LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO PREDICT THE SPEED 
AND DIRECTION OF THESE MASS EJECTIONS 
TO PROVIDE ADVANCE WARNING FOR OBSERVERS SAY OF JUPITER 
WE'VE HAD REQUESTS FROM GUYS AT THE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON 
THAT IF THEY WANT TO LOOK AT THE JOVIAN AURORA FOR EXAMPLE 
IF WE CAN SAY THERE'S SOMETHING ON YOUR WAY IN A FEW DAYS 
THAT GIVES THEM AN ADVANTAGE TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT A SPECIFIC TIME 
AS WE CAN SEE THESE MASS EJECTIONS EVOLVING INTO SPACE 
WE CAN PREDICT THEIR ARRIVAL NOW AT ANY POSITION IN THE HELIOSPHERE AT ANY TIME 
IF WE KNOW THERE'S A MISSION SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE ORBITS OF MARS 
AND JUPITER WE CAN SAY THAT THERE'S SOMETHING COMING YOUR WAY 
AND THERE'S SOME SCIENTIFIC MEASUREMENTS TO BE MADE 
IT REALLY DOES START TO JOIN UP ALL THESE DIFFERENT MISSIONS 
THAT ARE OFF INVESTIGATING LITTLE PARTS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM ALONE 
SO IT'S ALL COMING TOGETHER QUITE QUICKLY 
I THINK VERY EXCITING YEARS LIE AHEAD 
TIM CHRIS THANK YOU SO MUCH 
THANK YOU THANK YOU 
ONE VERY SAD NOTE THIS TIME THE DEATH OF ARTHUR C. CLARKE 
OUR GREAT VISIONARY 
I FIRST MET ARTHUR WHEN I WAS TWELVE 
HE WAS SEVENTEEN AT A MEETING OF THE BRITISH INTERPLANETARY SOCIETY 
DESPITE THE FIVE YEAR DIFFERENCE IN OUR AGES 
WE STRUCK UP AN IMMEDIATE FRIENDSHIP THAT LASTED ALL THE WAY THROUGH OUR LIVES 
HE FORESAW SO MUCH IT WASN'T ONLY COMMUNICATION SATELLITES 
THERE WAS SO MUCH ELSE 
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN I DID A SKY AT NIGHT PROGRAMME WITH MICHAEL BENTINE 
AND I ALSO TALKED TO ARTHUR CLARKE 
YOU KNOW I CAME ACROSS A COPY OF WIRELESS WORLD 
THIS IS REGARDED NOW WITH SOME VENERATION 
THE NINETEEN FORTY FIVE ISSUE IN WHICH ARTHUR CLARKE FORECASTS COMMUNICATION SATELLITES 
AND IT'S NOT EVEN ON THE COVER I REMEMBER THIS 
THIS WAS GREETED WITH A TREMENDOUS OUTBURST OF PUBLIC APATHY AT THE TIME 
NO ONE TOOK THE SLIGHTEST NOTICE OF IT TREMENDOUS ARTICLE 
HE DIDN'T GET IT ALL RIGHT 
ONE THING HE WASN'T CERTAIN ABOUT WAS THE TIMESCALE 
WHEN HE WAS IN ENGLAND I ASKED HIM WHETHER THIS KIND OF SATELLITE 
HAD HAPPENED EARLIER OR LATER THAN HE'D EXPECTED 
IT HAPPENED MUCH SOONER I THOUGHT IT WOULDN'T BE AROUND TILL THE END OF THIS CENTURY 
MAYBE NINETEEN NINETY ALSO I ENVISAGED VERY LARGE MANNED SPACE STATIONS 
NOT THE SMALL COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES THAT HAVE ARRIVED 
AND THE REASON'S RATHER INTERESTING AT THE TIME I WROTE THAT PAPER 
I WAS WORKING ON A COMPLEX R. A. F. RADAR EQUIPMENT 
WHICH CONTAINED AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF RADIO VALVES IF YOU REMEMBER THOSE THING 
I DO THERE WAS ABOUT ONE THOUSAND OF THEM IN THIS COMPLEX EQUIPMENT 
EVERY DAY TWO OR THREE BLEW UP WE WERE ALWAYS REPLACING THEM 
IT WAS INCONCEIVABLE TO ME THAT ELABORATE ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT 
WOULD NOT NEED A FULL TIME MAINTENANCE STAFF 
THE TRANSISTOR CAME ALONG 
AND MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR COMMUNICATION SATELLITES TO BE BUILT AND LAUNCHED 
TWENTY YEARS AHEAD OF MY SCHEDULE 
ARTHUR CLARKE'S VISION RANGED MUCH FURTHER THAN THAT 
TO MARS TO BEYOND ACROSS THE GALAXY 
HE GOT SO MUCH RIGHT HE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE REMEMBERED 
NOW ON TO OTHER NEWS CHRIS SATURN YES 
MORE EXCITING RESULTS FROM CASSINI THE PROBE THAT'S BEEN ORBITING SATURN 
FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW AND WHICH RECENTLY FLEW THIRTY MILES ABOVE THE MOON 
ENCELADUS ENCELADUS MAKES NO SENSE 
IT'S A SMALL MOON IT SHOULD BE FROZEN SOLID 
IT HAS THIS GEYSER THIS JET OF MATERIAL SHOOTING OUT FROM THE MOON 
CASSINI FLEW STRAIGHT THROUGH THAT JET 
WHICH MEANS WE CAN MEASURE ITS COMPOSITION 
IT TURNS OUT IT'S RATHER LIKE A COMET 
IT'S WATER WITH A MIX OF NATURAL GAS AND A FEW OTHER HEAVY MOLECULES 
BUT ESSENTIALLY PRISTINE MATERIAL 
LEFT OVER FROM THE SOLAR SYSTEM'S FORMATION 
WHAT THAT MATERIAL SHOULD BE DOING AND WHAT'S HEATING IT UP 
TO CAUSE THIS JET TO OCCUR WE STILL HAVE NO IDEA BUT VERY EXCITING RESULTS 
WE JUST DON'T KNOW UNFORTUNATELY 
AND THE NEXT SATELLITE THE RHEA 
MUCH LARGER NEARLY ONE THOUSAND MILES ACROSS 
THIS NOW APPEARS TO HAVE A RING A RING OF MATERIAL GOING ROUND IT 
A RING OF A RINGED PLANET THAT WAS TOTALLY UNEXPECTED 
YES AND IT'S A LARGE STRUCTURE TOO ONE THOUSAND'S OF MILES ACROSS 
WE NOW HAVE SOME WORK TO DO TRYING TO EXPLAIN RHEA 
EVERY TIME WE LOOK AT ANY OF SATURN'S MOONS 
WE DISCOVER THEY'RE MUCH MORE INTERESTING AND CONFUSING THAN WE THOUGHT 
COME BACK TO OUR FAVOURITE MARS 
THERE'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS AVALANCHE THERE THERE HAS 
MORE TO THE POINT WE'VE CAPTURED IT IN THIS WONDERFUL IMAGE 
FROM THE MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER 
WE'RE LOOKING DOWN AT A STEEP SLOPE ABOUT SIXTY DEGREES 
YOU CAN SEE THE ICE ON THE LEFT OF THE PICTURE 
THIS IS WATER AND CARBON DIOXIDE ICE FROM THE NORTHERN POLAR CAP 
SOME OF IT'S FALLING DOWN THE SLOPE 
YOU CAN SEE THE DUST BEING KICKED UP BY THE AVALANCHE 
YOU GET A REAL SENSE OF STANDING ON THE RED PLANET 
HOPEFULLY NOT TOO CLOSE WE ONCE THOUGHT MARS WAS A DULL WORLD 
HOW WRONG WE WERE 
THERE'S PLENTY MORE TO COME FROM THIS MISSION 
CHRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WELL IT'S NEWSLETTER TIME 
IF YOU WANT YOUR NEWSLETTER SEND YOUR STAMPED ADDRESS ENVELOPE TO 
AND WHEN I COME BACK NEXT MONTH IT'LL BE OUR PROGRAMME NUMBER SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SIX 
GOODNIGHT
