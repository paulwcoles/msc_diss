RECORDS FROM THE VARIOUS PLACES WHERE THE BURROWS FAMILY HAVE LIVED 
NORTH KENT POLICE AND SOCIAL SERVICES ARE ALERTED BY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SUSPECTING SPOUSAL ABUSE 
WHEN JUDY BURROWS IS ADMITTED WITH BURNS AND A DISLOCATED KNEE AND AND NOTHING THEY MOVE 
THE NEXT TIME SHE'S ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL IT'S IN LINCOLN 
WHERE MRS. BURROWS SUFFERS A THIRD TRIMESTER MISCARRIAGE CAUSED BY ABDOMINAL TRAUMA 
AGAIN POLICE AND SOCIAL SERVICES ALERTED AND THEY MOVE AGAIN

TOTALLY SILENT CREEPED ME OUT 
I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT THAT'S COS HE WAS TALKING AT YOU 
GIVING YOU GRIEF ABOUT SUPPORTING SPURS 
HE WAS JOKING AND BEING LOUD 
HE WAS LOUD THE HOUSE WAS DEAD SILENT AND AND 
I KEPT THINKING THAT MAYBE THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON IN THAT HOUSE 
YOU KNOW LIKE DOMESTIC YOU CAN'T SAY THAT WITH NO PROOF 
IT'S JUST A GUT FEELING 
IN HER STATEMENT JUDY BURROWS SAYS HER SON'S ATTACK ON HER HUSBAND WAS COMPLETELY UNPROVOKED 
WELL I'M JUST SAYING I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON 
SO DO WE BUT JUDY BURROWS IS FRAGILE AND UNWILLING TO TALK IS PUTTING IT MILDLY

YOU'LL VISIT SEAN BURROWS IN HOSPITAL

HASSLED ME ABOUT OUR HOME LIFE AND THEN SUGGESTED I MOVE STATIONS 
COS HE MADE THE MISTAKE OF COMING ON TO ME I DIDN'T HASSLE YOU I WAS TRYING TO DO MY JOB

HE'S ALWAYS HAD A VERY SHORT FUSE HASN'T HE 
I DON'T KNOW MAYBE IT WAS DRUGS 
BUT YOU KNOW HE'S MY SON I'M NOT GOING TO TURN MY BACK ON HIM 
HEY YOU NEED TO CONCENTRATE ON GETTING WELL

THANKS FOR COMING ESPECIALLY IN YOUR OWN TIME 
IT'S ALL RIGHT YOU LOOK AFTER YOURSELF 
I NEED A TAME MAN U. FAN TO LAUGH AT 
YOU HAVEN'T GOT A LEG TO STAND ON SPURS 
O. I. SUPER TOTTENHAM ARE JUST BIDING THEIR TIME MATE 
ONE DAY ALL WILL TREMBLE BEFORE THE GENIUS OF WHITE HART LANE DREAM ON NEIL 
IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU MRS. BURROWS AND YOU 
THEY COULDN'T CATCH A COLD 
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT 
SOMETHING'S GOING ON I KNOW 
ONE SEC 
HELLO HE'S GETTING A BATH I'M GOING TO GET A COFFEE

YEAH COURSE 
HEY YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHO WE'VE GOT TO GO ROUND AND SEE WHEN WE GET A MINUTE WHO 
THE WOMAN WITH THE MAD BITING CHILD 
BETTER GET BACK INTO UNIFORM AND YOU BETTER GET SOME SHIN PADS ON 
MRS. BURROWS 
HI I'M D. S. FRENCH THIS IS D. C. I. VAUGHAN 
I KNEW YOU'D WANT TO BE WITH YOUR HUSBAND SO RATHER THAN ASK YOU TO COME TO THE STATION 
I THOUGHT IT'D BE A GOOD IDEA IF WE CAME HERE 
I'VE SAID WHAT HAPPENED NO IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR STATEMENT 
I WANTED TO BRING YOU UP TO DATE ON WHAT CHARGES YOUR SON WILL BE FACING 
NOW THAT YOUR HUSBAND'S CONDITION HAS IMPROVED CAN WE SIT DOWN 
THANKS 
HOW IS YOUR HUSBAND HE'S ALL RIGHT 
IT'S A VERY GOOD HOSPITAL 
MY WIFE JUST HAD OUR FIRST BABY HERE 
A LITTLE GIRL RUBY EIGHT WEEKS AGO 
SHE CRIES EVERY NIGHT 
WE'RE CONVINCED WE'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG 
I HAVEN'T GOT LONG IT WON'T TAKE A MINUTE 
WOUNDING WITH INTENT IT'S EASIER TO PROVE THAN ATTEMPTED MURDER 
LEE'S ATTACK ON SEAN WAS SUDDEN SO THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY PREMEDITATION 
BUT HE WON'T GO TO PRISON I MEAN 
SEAN'S ALIVE HE'S GOING TO BE O. K. SO LEE WON'T GO TO PRISON WILL HE I'M AFRAID HE WILL 
BUT HE'S ONLY YOUNG HE'LL GET TAKEN INTO CARE HE'LL BE LOOKED AFTER 
HE'S HE'S ONLY A BOY HE'S NOT STRONG 
HE ATTACKED YOUR HUSBAND WITHOUT PROVOCATION HE'LL BE FACING CUSTODY 
FOR HOW LONG IT DEPENDS WE HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND THAT LEE HAS BEEN VIOLENT BEFORE 
HE'LL ALSO HAVE A PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION AS PART OF PRE SENTENCING 
AND THAT MAY HAVE A BEARING ON THE AMOUNT OF TIME HE SERVES 
NOW YOU AND MR. BURROWS ARE PREPARED TO GO TO COURT FOR THIS AREN'T YOU TO COURT 
YOU WON'T HAVE TO APPEAR IF YOU DON'T FEEL ABLE BUT IT WILL BE DISTURBING FOR THE THREE OF YOU 
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GIVE YOUR TESTIMONY VIA VIDEO LINK 
BUT THE C. P. S. WILL BUILD A CASE PRIMARILY ON YOUR STATEMENT 
WHICH MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY DETAIL 
IS AS PRECISE AS IT CAN BE IN ORDER TO SECURE LEE'S CONVICTION 
YOU SAY LEE'S ASSAULT ON YOUR HUSBAND WAS COMPLETELY UNPROVOKED 
IT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE
