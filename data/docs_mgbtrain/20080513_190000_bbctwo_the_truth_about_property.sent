WE'VE ALL GOT USED TO THE IDEA THAT A HOUSE IS NOT JUST A HOME 
BUT A SOLID INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE 
IN RECENT YEARS PROPERTY HAS SEEMED LIKE A ONE WAY BET 
BUT HOUSE PRICES ARE SLIPPING NOW 
NO ONE KNOWS IF THEY MIGHT BE ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE 
WE'RE GOING TO TRAVEL THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF BRITAIN TO MEET THE WINNERS 
IT'S A DEVELOPER'S PARADISE 
IT'S WELL AND TRULY ON THE INTERNATIONAL MAP 
IT'S WIN WIN WIN REALLY 
THE LOSERS ALL OUR SAVINGS HAVE GONE INTO THIS EVERYTHING 
WE COULD BE LEFT WITH NOTHING 
I'M GOING TO BE HOMELESS 
THE INVESTMENT REFUSERS YOU DON'T REALLY BUY HOUSES JUST 
FOR MONETARY REASONS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A REALLY HAPPY PLACE 
AND THE PROPERTY DOOMSAYERS THE RESIDENCE IS OVERVALUED BY TWENTY TO THIRTY PER CENT 
YOU THINK HOUSE PRICES WILL FALL BY TWENTY TO THIRTY PER CENT THEY'RE ALREADY FALLING 
WE'LL BE SHOWING YOU IF YOUR HOME IS AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY 
AND FINDING OUT IF PROPERTY NOW PRICES HAVE FALLEN IS A SOLID INVESTMENT 
TEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THAT'S WHAT THE AVERAGE HOME HAS LOST SINCE PRICES PEAKED LAST YEAR 
OUR FAITH IN BRICKS AND MORTAR IS STARTING TO CRUMBLE 
HIGH TIME THEN TO REASSESS AN INVESTMENT THAT'S LOOKED FOR SO LONG LIKE AN EASY WAY TO MAKE MONEY 
WHOA IT'S GETTING A BIT ROUGHER NOW 
JENNY'S HEADING FOR THE CAPITAL BUT I WANT TO GET OFF THE AVERAGE ESTATE AGENT'S RADAR 
CAN I FIND VALUE FOR MONEY ANYWHERE 
IF YOU THOUGHT HOUSE PRICES HAVE BECOME GOT TOO HIGH 
I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU LOVELY OLD COTTAGE TWO BEDROOMS 
SEA VIEWS STANDING IN ITS OWN PLOT OF LAND DRY STONE WALLS AROUND IT 
ONLY THIRTY THOUSAND YOU MIGHT FIND THE DAILY COMMUTE A BIT OF A STRUGGLE THOUGH 
IT'S IN THE NORTHERN ORKNEY ISLANDS 
A BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO LIVE BUT A HARD PLACE TO MAKE A LIVING 
YOU CAN'T RELY ON A STEADY STREAM OF BUYERS WANTING TO MOVE HERE 
THAT PREVENTS PRICES RISING AND MAKES IT HARDER TO SELL WHEN YOU WANT TO 
BUT WHATEVER YOU MAKE OF HOW DESIRABLE IT IS TO LIVE HERE NOW 
THESE ISLANDS DO HAVE AN ANCIENT HUMAN FOOTPRINT 
THIS PLACE IS MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND YEARS OLD 
IT'S OLDER THAN THE PYRAMIDS OLDER THAN STONEHENGE 
BUT IT'S NOT A TEMPLE IT'S NOT A BURIAL GROUND THIS IS A HOUSE 
OUR HOMES HAVE ALWAYS GIVEN US THAT SENSE OF SECURITY OF SOMETHING 
THAT'S GOING TO LAST OF SOMETHING TANGIBLE 
BUT HAS THAT SENSE OF SOMETHING WE CAN SEE AND TOUCH STARTED TO BLIND US TO FINANCIAL COMMON SENSE 
TO FIND OUT I'M GOING TO CROSS BRITAIN HEADING FOR LAND'S END 
PRICES ARE NO LONGER AT THEIR PEAK BUT OVER THE YEAR THEY'RE DOWN BARELY ONE PER CENT 
WHEN YOU HEAR TALK OF PRICES CRASHING 
DON'T FORGET THEY'VE TREBLED IN LITTLE MORE THAN A DECADE 
AND IN PLACES WHERE THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF BUYERS AND NO SHORTAGE OF MONEY PRICES ARE STILL RISING 
PLACES LIKE MONTROSE NEAR ABERDEEN IT'S SEEN THE FASTEST GROWTH IN HOUSE PRICES ANYWHERE IN THE U. K. 
UP THIRTY NINE PER CENT LAST YEAR 
SO LOTS OF NEW BUILD HOUSES HERE ON MY RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF MONTROSE 
THIS IS WHAT YOU'D EXPECT TO SEE WHEN PRICES HAVE REALLY SHOT UP 
NEW HOMES BEING BUILT AND MORE HOMES COMING ONTO THE MARKET TO MEET THE HIGH DEMAND FOR HOUSING 
SUPPLY IN OTHER WORDS RISES TO MEET DEMAND 
SCOTTISH HOUSE PRICES HAVE LAGGED BEHIND IN THE RECENT BOOM 
NOW TO SANDY KENNEDY'S DELIGHT THEY'RE PLAYING CATCH UP 
WHAT'S GONE ON THEN DO YOU KNOW 
IT'S JUST GONE A BIT CRAZY A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MONTROSE ARE A BIT OH YES THIS IS FABULOUS YOU KNOW 
SO WHAT'S YOUR EXPERIENCE OF THE HOUSING MARKET HERE 
FOUR YEARS AGO WE MOVED HERE AND BASICALLY WE WANTED TO MOVE UP THE LADDER 
SO WE DECIDED TO BUY SOME FLATS RENOVATE AND BASICALLY SELL SO THAT WE COULD MOVE UP 
AT THAT POINT WE BOUGHT FOUR THINKING WE WERE GOING TO GET ONE WE BID FOR FOUR 
I'M GOING TO BE NOSY NOW AND ASK HOW MUCH YOU PAID FOR THEM 
TWO OF THEM WERE FOURTEEN THOUSAND EACH 
YOU PAID TWENTY EIGHT GRAND FOR TWO FLATS 
TWO FLATS AND THEN WE RENOVATED THEM AND THEN WE SOLD THEM 
DO YOU THINK THERE'S A SENSE MAYBE THAT PRICES LIKE THIS CAN'T LAST 
I MEAN WHEN IT GOES UP BY THIRTY NINE PER CENT 
IT CAN'T LAST THE WAY IT IS AT THE MOMENT IT IS QUITE SCARY 
WE TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE IF ANYTHING DOES GO WRONG 
AND THIS WHOLE FABULOUSNESS THAT'S HAPPENING WITH HOUSE PRICES AND THAT COLLAPSES 
WHERE IS EVERYBODY GONNA BE 
IT'S QUITE TENSE LIVING THINKING COULD IT HAPPEN TOMORROW 
COULD WHAT HAPPEN 
A CRASH OR WILL IT GO ON 
NOBODY KNOWS 
IT'S IN THE CAPITAL THE BIGGEST DEALS ARE MADE 
AND HERE CRASH IS A SCARY WORD 
THE MERE MENTION OF IT IS ENOUGH TO MAKE SUITS SWEAT 
BUT IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU CAN STILL MAKE MONEY IN A FALLING MARKET 
BACK IN THE EARLY NINETIES WHEN MANY WERE WARY OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY 
A YOUNG LAD WORKING IN HIS MUM'S LAUNDRETTE BOUGHT A HOUSE HERE ON CHAPEL MARKET FOR ONE HUNDRED FORTY GRAND 
TODAY HE OWNS ASSETS IN EXCESS OF HALF A BILLION POUNDS 
CAN I INTEREST YOU IN SOME ROCK 'N ROLL REGGAE SOUL GOSPEL BLUES 
ONE POINT NINE NINE 
ANDREAS HI 
I'M GOOD THANKS FOR COMING 
SO THIS IS YOUR OLD STAMPING GROUND YES 
BEEN TEN YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE 
GOOD OLD MEMORIES WHERE IT ALL STARTED WHERE WAS IT 
IT WAS NUMBER FIFTEEN JUST HERE 
IT WAS AN OLD SHOE SHOP UNDERNEATH AND IT WAS JUST DERELICT UPSTAIRS 
SO IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO GO IN AND FIX THE SHOP UP 
AND THEN WE CREATED FOUR RESIDENTIAL APARTMENTS 
WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE TO BE BACK IT'S GOOD I HAVEN'T BEEN BACK FOR A FEW YEARS THERE'S A FEW OLD FACES 
THERE'S AN OLD MATE OF MINE THERE JUST SAY HELLO TO HIM 
HOW ARE YOU HOW ARE YOU GOOD MATE WHAT ARE YOU UP TO USUAL PROPERTY 
HOW ARE YOU DOING WELL NOT AS GOOD AS YOU OBVIOUSLY 
ALL RIGHT COPING DO YOU GET DOWN THE CALEY MUCH 
TRY NOT TO IT'S CHANGED A BIT DOWN THERE NOW CHANGED 
A LOT OF PEOPLE BOUGHT PROPERTIES DOWN THERE AND IT SPOILED IT 
IT'S ALL THEM PROPERTY DEVELOPERS 
A ONE BEDROOM FLAT QUARTER OF A MILLION POUND PLUS 
IT'S GONE TOO FAR IT'S GONE TOO MUCH 
I BOUGHT THAT BUILDING THERE FOURTEEN YEARS AGO FOR ONE HUNDRED FORTY GRAND 
WE MADE FOUR FLATS OUT OF IT AND NOW IT'S TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND JUST FOR ONE FLAT 
THAT JUST SHOWS YOU IN THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS WHAT'S HAPPENED 
NICE THOUGH INNIT 
ANYWAY NICE TO SEE YOU 
GOOD LUCK YEAH IF YOU NEED ANY ADVICE 
I KNOW WHERE TO FIND YOU 
CHEERS TAKE CARE 
ANDREAS PANAYIOTOU'S TRICK WAS SIMPLE BUY SHABBY HOUSES IN 
UP AND COMING AREAS CONVERT THEM INTO LUXURY FLATS THEN HOLD ONTO THEM AND RENT THEM OUT 
YOU COULD SEE THAT ISLINGTON AND 
HACKNEY WERE SUCH BIG BOROUGHS WHICH WERE UNDERDEVELOPED 
THERE WAS NO DEVELOPMENT GOING ON IT WAS A NO BRAINER 
SO IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT IT WAS CLEVER I'M NOT CLEVER 
I LEFT SCHOOL AT FOURTEEN FIFTEEN 
NO RESULTS NO A LEVELS O. LEVELS 
IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING CLEVER IT'S COMMON SENSE AND GUT FEELING 
BUT THE MARKET WAS ON MY SIDE AS WELL SO IT MADE IT VERY EASY FOR ME 
IT'S NOT EASY TODAY THOUGH IF YOU ASK ME TODAY COULD I GO BACK 
AND DO WHAT I DID IN RESIDENTIAL FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS I WOULD SAY TODAY'S IT'S NEAR IMPOSSIBLE 
ANDREAS USED TO BE THE LARGEST PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL LANDLORD IN THE COUNTRY 
BUT HE NEVER FORGOT THAT PRICES GO UP AND DOWN IN CYCLES 
IN THE PREVIOUS BOOM IN THE LATE EIGHTIES THE MARKET ROSE BY ONE HUNDRED SIXTY PER CENT THEN FELL BY TWENTY PER CENT 
TIMING IS EVERYTHING 
I'VE BEEN IN THIS BOOM PERIOD BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A TIME WHEN IT'S GONNA COME TO THE END 
IT WAS ALWAYS OBVIOUS TO ME I HAD TO GET OUT OF THIS SO WHAT DID YOU DO 
WE JUST SOLD OUT BIG CHUNKS TO FUNDS AND DIFFERENT PROPERTY COMPANIES 
HOW MANY DID YOU SELL WE SOLD ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION WORTH 
WOW 
YEAH 
WAS IT A GOOD DECISION 
GREAT DECISION GREAT DECISION 
IF YOU ASKED ME TO SELL THAT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION WORTH OF PROPERTY TODAY 
I'D BE LUCKY IF I WOULD HAVE ACHIEVED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION 
IT COULD HAVE COST ME TWO HUNDRED MILLION 
YOU'RE THE MAN WHO GOT THE MARKET RIGHT TWO YEARS AGO WHEN IT WAS ABOUT TO FALL 
WHAT'S YOUR BEST GUESS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NOW 
THE BEST GUESS IS WE'RE GOING TO BE IN FOR SOME VERY SERIOUS TIMES FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS 
THERE'S GOING TO BE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS IN THE MARKET THAT'S A EUPHEMISM ISN'T IT FOR FALLING 
YEAH PRICES ARE GONNA DROP THAT IS THE ADJUSTMENT 
THE ADJUSTMENT'S ONLY GOING TO GO DOWN NOT UP 
NO ONE KNOWS HOW BAD IT'S GOING TO GET 
BUT IF I WAS GOING TO GIVE A PREDICTION 
YOU'D HAVE TO SAY THAT RESIDENTIAL PRICES ARE TWENTY TO THIRTY PER CENT OVERVALUED 
SO THEY COULD FALL BY TWENTY TO THIRTY PER CENT 
THEY HAVE ALREADY 
TWENTY TO THIRTY PER CENT THAT'S A HEFTY DROP 
IF HE'S RIGHT BUYING NOW HARDLY LOOKS LIKE A SOLID INVESTMENT 
BUT IS HE RIGHT 
ECONOMISTS MORTGAGE LENDERS AND CENTRAL BANKERS HAVE ALL GOT IT WRONG IN RECENT YEARS 
THE EXPERTS CAN'T TELL YOU 
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE FOR YOURSELF AND BET THE HOUSE THAT YOU'RE RIGHT 
IN OTHER WORDS THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT DECISION OF YOUR LIFE IS BASED ON A GUESS 
I'M REALLY WORRIED THAT WE COULD END UP IN NEGATIVE EQUITY 
THAT REALLY SCARES ME BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO SCARE SIMON AS MUCH DOES IT NO 
TINA AND SIMON PLACED THEIR BETS JUST TWO MONTHS AGO 
BUYING A HOUSE TOGETHER HERE IN NEWTON AYCLIFFE NEAR DARLINGTON 
AND WHAT WAS BEHIND THAT DESIRE TO BUY 
COMMITMENT REALLY IT WAS COMMITMENT WE HATED BEING APART AND WE DIDN'T LIVE TOGETHER 
SIMON WOULD JUST STAY OVER NOW AND THEN SO WE THOUGHT WE'LL TAKE THE BIG STEP 
WE WANT TO BE TOGETHER ALL THE TIME 
SO IN A WAY BUYING A PLACE TOGETHER IS MAKING A COMMITMENT 
ALMOST A BIT LIKE GETTING MARRIED WAS ONCE UPON A TIME 
ONCE UPON A TIME AYE BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THAT NOW IS IT 
BYE LOVE YOU SEE YA SEE YOU LATER 
I HOPE MY QUESTION ABOUT MARRIAGE HASN'T SCARED SIMON OFF 
BUT WHY DID THEY BUY INSTEAD OF RENTING IN TODAY'S MARKET 
WE DID THINK INITIALLY MAYBE THIS COULD BE AN INVESTMENT 
BUT OUR VIEW OF THAT'S CHANGED NOW 
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT IT NOW REGRET IT 
REALLY YEAH WE DO 
WE'RE THINKING 
WHAT HAVE WE DONE WHAT HAVE WE DONE YOU'RE GETTING ON THE PROPERTY LADDER 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HAPPY 
THAT'S WHAT WE THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN 
INITIALLY WE WOULD BE HAPPY BUT THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY GONNA BE THE CASE 
IF PRICES DO FALL FURTHER 
WE'LL BE LEFT WITH NO OTHER OPTION 
WE'LL HAVE TO STAY AND RIDE IT OUT HOPING THAT THEY RISE AGAIN WE ARE WORSE OFF NOW 
IF WE'D PRIVATELY RENTED A PROPERTY FOR WHAT WE PAID 
WE COULD HAVE HAD A FANTASTIC THREE OR FOUR BEDROOM PROPERTY THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL 
WHEREAS BECAUSE WE'VE CHOSEN TO BUY THIS IS WHAT WE'VE GOT 
IT'S NOTHING LIKE WE EXPECTED IT TO BE 
HOW HAS THE WHOLE BUSINESS AFFECTED YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SIMON 
IT'S PUT A HUGE STRAIN ON OUR RELATIONSHIP 
BECAUSE IT'S A HUGE STRESS AND ALL WE DO IS TALK ABOUT THE HOUSE 
WHAT IF THIS WHAT IF THAT 
WE COULD HAVE JUST NOT TOOK A RISK AND MOVED IN AND PRIVATELY RENTED 
WE DON'T WANT TO BE HERE 
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR HOUSE IS IT AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY A LIABILITY 
IT'S DEFINITELY A LIABILITY 
TINA AND SIMON ARE COMMITTED FOR THE LONG TERM 
IN THEORY THEY CAN DEAL WITH PRICES FALLING EVEN WITH NEGATIVE EQUITY FOR A FEW YEARS 
BUT TINA'S WORRIED IT COULD BE A LONG TIME BEFORE THEY RISE AGAIN AND MEANWHILE THEY'D BE TRAPPED 
ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND FIRST TIME BUYERS HAVE BOUGHT WITHIN THE LAST SIX MONTHS 
THEY'VE WATCHED PRICES SLIDE MONTH BY MONTH 
SO IT'S HARDLY SURPRISING THAT TINA AND OTHERS LIKE HER 
HAVE FALLEN OUT OF LOVE WITH PROPERTY 
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF US 
I'VE COME TO COVENT GARDEN TO ASK IF PEOPLE VIEW THEIR HOME 
AS A FINANCIAL INVESTMENT OR AN EMOTIONAL ONE 
EXCUSE ME HELLO HELLO HELLO 
WHAT DOES YOUR HOUSE MEAN TO YOU 
DOES IT MEAN MONEY DOES IT MEAN FAMILY DOES IT MEAN SANCTUARY 
INVESTMENT AND FAMILY YOU SAID INVESTMENT FIRST 
THAT'S BECAUSE THE KIDS HAVE LEFT HOME NOW 
IS THAT A REPRESENTATION OF HOME FOR YOU 
YEAH NICE KIND OF HAPPY PLACE O. K. OPPOSED TO COME ROUND THE OTHER SIDE 
D. A. D. A. IS IT MORE ABOUT THAT 
IT'S DEFINITELY NOTHING TO DO WITH MONEY IS YOURS 
WELL I KNOW HOW MUCH IT COST COS I HAVE TO PAY FOR IT WE ALL DO 
I ENJOY LIVING IN IT I LOVE DOING IT UP AND ALL THESE THINGS 
BUT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE MONEY SIDE ALL THE TIME 
IT'S ALL ABOUT HARD CASH DEFINITELY ONE HUNDRED PER CENT MONEY 
THE HOME IS A VERY HAPPY PLACE SO PSYCHOLOGICALLY IT'S EVERYTHING 
MY HOME AND THE CHILDREN AND OUR FAMILY IS EVERYTHING TO ME 
SO IT'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL BOND WITH THE HOUSE 
IS THAT MORE ACCURATE FOR YOU YES IS IT SO IS PROPERTY JUST ABOUT INVESTMENT FOR YOU 
ABSOLUTELY IS IT 
I THINK FOR ME ANYWAY I THINK SO 
HAVE YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS 
YES YES 
WHAT'S APPEALING ABOUT PROPERTY AS AN INVESTMENT GOES BEYOND THE MONEY 
IT'S A SENSE OF SECURITY IN AN INSECURE WORLD A SENSE OF SOMETHING PERMANENT 
WHERE MUCH OF THE REST OF LIFE SEEMS TEMPORARY 
A SENSE OF SOMETHING REALLY SOLID SOMETHING TANGIBLE 
SOMETHING YOU CAN SEE AND FEEL 
BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS LIKE THAT 
SOMEWHERE BEYOND THE SEA 
I'VE COME TO SKIPSEA ON YORKSHIRE'S RIVIERA 
JOSIE HI HOW ARE YOU 
JOSIE AND COLIN BOUGHT THEIR DREAM HOME TWENTY YEARS AGO 
CAN I HAVE A LOOK AROUND YES 
THEY KNEW IT WAS IN A VULNERABLE POSITION BUT WENT AHEAD ANYWAY 
COME IN COME IN OR COME OUT SO THIS USED TO BE INDOORS 
IT DID YES THAT WAS THE DINING ROOM 
THERE WAS A DINING ROOM THERE A PANTRY THERE 
WE'VE JUST COME THROUGH THE KITCHEN 
THERE WAS A GARDEN IN FRONT OF HERE WITH A CONSERVATORY AND A FENCE ROUND IT AND BEYOND THAT WAS A ROAD 
SO EXACTLY HOW FAR OUT DID IT GO FROM HERE 
IT WAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FEET A ROAD WHERE THE SEA NOW IS 
YEAH AND IT'S VERY HARD TO IMAGINE IT EVER BEING THERE 
WHAT'S YOUR SITUATION NOW 
WE'VE GOT NOWHERE TO GO SO WE'RE JUST SORT OF HERE 
COS I DON'T REALLY WANT TO GO 
IF WE COULD REBUILD IT WE WOULD DO BUT WE CAN'T 
IT'S VERY SAD 
I ONLY DO THAT WHEN I ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT IT 
WELL WE DON'T ACTUALLY COME IN HERE VERY OFTEN BECAUSE WE GET SO UPSET ABOUT IT 
YEAH 
WITH NO SAVINGS COLIN AND JOSIE ARE NOW ALSO LEFT WITH NO HOME 
THEY'RE CURRENTLY LIVING IN A CARAVAN 
THE HOUSE WAS INSURED FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND BUT THEY WOULDN'T PAY OUT BECAUSE OF COASTAL EROSION 
BUT NO ONE CAME TO LOOK AT IT 
THEY WEREN'T BOTHERED THEY JUST TOOK OUR MONEY AND WHEN IT CAME TO IT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW 
BUT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL FARMHOUSE WASN'T IT 
AND YOU DON'T REALLY BUY HOUSES JUST FOR MONETARY REASONS 
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A REALLY HAPPY PLACE MONEY'S NEVER HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT REALLY 
WHICH IS WHY WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY THAT'S WHY WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY 
THAT'S WHERE JOSIE AND COLIN HAVE BEEN SO UNLUCKY 
FOR ANY PROPERTY TO WORK AS AN INVESTMENT YOU HAVE TO PLAN 
WHEN YOU'LL GET OUT WHEN TO TAKE YOUR PROFITS OR CUT YOUR LOSSES 
THE TROUBLE IS YOUR PLANS MAY BE UPSET 
EVENTS CAN OVERTAKE YOU 
THANKFULLY MOST OF US WON'T SEE OUR HOMES FALL INTO THE SEA 
BUT CHANCES ARE WE WILL SEE THEM FALL IN VALUE AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM 
SO DO WE REALISE JUST HOW RISKY PROPERTY CAN BE 
YOUR MONEY'S MUCH SAFER IN A BANK RIGHT 
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT WHEN WE ASKED THEM 
ALMOST TWO THIRDS THOUGHT MONEY WAS AS SAFE 
IF NOT SAFER IN THE HOUSING MARKET 
IT'S NOT BECAUSE IN PROPERTY YOU CAN LOSE MONEY AS PRICES FALL 
IN THE BANK YOU'RE GUARANTEED AT LEAST SOME RETURN 
BUT THEN AGAIN YOU CAN'T LIVE IN A BANK AND EVERYONE LIKES TO HAVE A LITTLE PLACE TO CALL THEIR OWN 
WOW CASTLE RAMPARTS 
RIPLEY CASTLE HAS BEEN THE SEAT OF THE INGILBY FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS' 
IS IT LADY EMMA YES I AM HELLO WELCOME NICE TO MEET YOU CALL ME EMMA 
HAVE YOU HAD A GOOD JOURNEY 
FANTASTIC COME IN WELCOME TO RIPLEY CASTLE 
IF YOU THINK RISING PROPERTY PRICES MAKE YOU RICH 
LADY EMMA WOULD BE THE FIRST TO REMIND YOU YOUR HOME ISN'T JUST AN ASSET 
IT'S A LIABILITY 
WE'RE VERY LUCKY THERE'S FANTASTIC VIEWS 
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE ON A BAD DAY IF I WORRIED ABOUT WHAT IT'S 
COSTING US AND WHERE WE WERE GOING TO END UP THEN YOU KNOW PERHAPS I'D NOT ENJOY IT QUITE SO MUCH 
THIS PLACE WAS BUILT TO KEEP OTHERS OUT NOT KEEP THE HEAT IN 
LOOK YOU CAN SEE I'VE GOT ALL THE BILLS ON THE TOP 
DO YOU FEEL A SENSE OF TREPIDATION WHEN YOU OPEN THAT ENVELOPE FROM THE GAS COMPANY 
WELL OH WE'VE BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR YOU 
THIS IS MY HUSBAND THOMAS NICE TO MEET YOU YOU'VE COME IN AT THE RIGH TIME WE'RE DISCUSSING BILLS 
HOW MUCH OF A HOLE DOES IT BURN IN YOUR POCKET 
THE BILLS ENORMOUS PROBABLY THE BEST EXAMPLE IS THE GAS BILLS 
WE HAD ONE QUARTERLY GAS BILL LAST YEAR WHICH WAS THIRTY THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY AND THAT WAS JUST A GAS BILL FOR ONE QUARTER 
ELECTRICITY PROBABLY RUNNING AT BETWEEN TWELVE THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND A QUARTER 
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TEMPTED TO JUST SELL UP AND BE RID OF ALL THE HASSLE 
YES ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WE WERE APPROACHED BY A SCANDINAVIAN OIL MILLIONAIRE 
WHO SAID I REALLY LOVE THE ESTATE YOU NAME YOUR PRICE AND I'LL BUY IT NO MATTER WHAT IT IS 
THAT MADE US THINK LONG AND HARD BECAUSE WE WERE STRUGGLING VERY 
BADLY AT THE TIME IT REALLY WAS A TEMPTING OFFER 
WE THOUGHT WE CAN CASH IN NOW AND WE WOULD HAVE MORE MONEY THAN WE COULD SPEND IN OUR LIFETIMES 
THE INGILBYS DIDN'T SELL 
INSTEAD THEY BORROWED WITH A LONG TERM PLAN 
THEY NOW ALLOW VISITORS INTO THEIR HOME AND THAT BRINGS IN THE MONEY 
IT'S A HELL OF A VIEW ISN'T IT MARVELLOUS ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY 
YOU SEE YOU SEE THE VIEW AND YOU SEE ALL OF THAT 
I'M STANDING HERE GOING LOOK THESE SLATES ARE REALLY SHOT 
I'M THINKING DON'T PUT YOUR FOOT THROUGH THE LEAD 
YES WE'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT THE TOP SIDE OF FIFTY THOUSAND JUST FOR THIS SMALL AREA OF ROOF HERE 
AND WHAT ABOUT FOR FIXING THE ROOF 
THE WHOLE ROOF IS NEARER A MILLION WOW 
SO YOU HAD TO BORROW MONEY OVER A VERY LONG TIME TAKE QUITE A BIG RISK 
AND LOOK INTO THE FUTURE TO A TIME WHEN THIS PLACE COULD MAKE A PROFIT 
YES THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT STATELIES IS SHORT TERM 
YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT IT LICKED YOU THINK YOU'VE DONE ALL THE WORK 
AND THEN ALONG COMES SOME LITTLE STRUCTURAL FAULT 
YOU'D NOT SPOTTED OR SOMETHING CHANGES THE VALUE OF YOUR PROPERTY THAT'S POSSIBLY OUTSIDE YOUR CONTROL 
YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS YOU CAN AT THE TIME 
IT TURNS OUT THAT OWNING A CASTLE DOES HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH OTHER KINDS OF PROPERTY INVESTMENT 
IF YOU REGARD IT AS A LONG TERM INVESTMENT 
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF AT FIRST IT BLEEDS MONEY YOU LOSE MONEY ON IT 
IF YOU WAIT LONG ENOUGH YOU CAN TURN IT ROUND 
AND EVENTUALLY HOPEFULLY IT'LL TURN INTO PROFIT 
I'M GOING TO MEET A FAMILY WHO ARE NOMADS IN COMPARISON 
THEY'VE MOVED FOUR TIMES IN JUST SIX YEARS 
EACH TIME THEY'VE BOUGHT CHEAP RENOVATED AND THEN SOLD 
AND WHEN YOU SELL YOUR PRIMARY RESIDENCE ANY PROFIT IS TAX FREE 
WOW 
IT HASN'T OBVIOUSLY BEEN TOUCHED FOR QUITE SOME TIME 
ALL WE'VE DONE HERE IS STRIPPED OFF WALLPAPER BUT THIS IS THE SORT 
OF CONDITION YOU NEED TO BUY THEM IN TO MAKE YOUR MARK AND EARN SOME CASH 
SO IT'S NOT JUST A LICK OF PAINT CERTAINLY NOT 
JULIE AND DAVID ARE AN EXPERIENCED DESIGNER BUILDER TEAM 
THEY'VE GIVEN UP THE DAY JOBS AND NOW DEVELOP PROPERTY FULL TIME 
WOW SO THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
THIS WILL BE THE MASTER BEDROOM YES 
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK HERE ISN'T THERE EVERYTHING NEEDS DOING 
I KNOW DOWN TO THE ROTTEN FLOORBOARDS 
YEAH IT REALLY IS GONNA BE A BIT OF A PROJECT 
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING YOU CAN SEE NEEDS PUTTING BACK IN ITS ORIGINAL STATE 
SO IT WON'T BE DONE IN A WEEKEND NO 
DON'T THINK IT WILL RATHER YOU THAN ME I THINK 
LUCKILY NEXT DOOR 
THEY'VE MADE A BIT MORE PROGRESS' 
IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
TROUBLE IS IN A FALLING MARKET THEY'LL MAKE LESS PROFIT 
HOW DO YOU STILL MAKE MONEY GIVEN THAT EVERYBODY'S DOING IT 
IT'S BASICALLY ALL HANDS ON 
WE DO THE LION'S SHARE OF THE WORK OURSELVES 
THE KEY FACTOR IS TO TRY AND NOT EMPLOY THAT MANY PEOPLE 
THAT WAY YOU KEEP YOUR PROFIT MARGIN 
JULIE AND DAVID HAVE WORKED THE PROPERTY LADDER AND PAID OFF THE MORTGAGE 
BUT NOW THEY'RE BORROWING AGAIN TO BUY MORE FLATS 
IT'S A RISKY STRATEGY 
SO FOR YOU IT'S ABOUT FINDING THE RIGHT HOUSE 
YES AND FOCUSING ON REGENERATION AREAS AGAIN SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN TOUCHED THAT NEEDS THE WORK 
IF YOU BUY AT THE RIGHT TIME AND SELL AT THE RIGHT TIME YOU SHOULD MAKE SOME PROFIT HOPEFULLY 
WHAT'S YOUR TOP TIP WHERE'S THE NEXT UP AND COMING 
WE HAVE ACTUALLY JUST FINISHED A LITTLE FLAT IN THE ELEPHANT AND CASTLE 
O. K. ELEPHANT AND CASTLE BUY ELEPHANT AND CASTLE NOT NOW NO 
PROPERTY SEEMS TO HAVE MADE SO MUCH MONEY FOR SOME 
WHY IS THAT 
WHAT IS IT ABOUT BRICKS AND MORTAR 
ACTUALLY IN THE LONG TERM FOR EVERY POUND INVESTED SHARES WILL MAKE YOU MORE MONEY THAN PROPERTY 
THING IS THERE'S A RISK WE WOULDN'T DARE TAKE TO INVEST IN SHARES 
THAT WE ARE WILLING TO TAKE WHEN WE INVEST IN PROPERTY 
WE BORROW BIG TIME 
MANSFIELD 
HOME OF THE MINERS' STRIKE RICHARD BACON 
AND ADAM KINGSWOOD A LETTING AGENT WHO DOESN'T OWN ANY PROPERTY YET BUT FANCIES GETTING INTO BUY TO LET 
I'VE BROUGHT ADAM TO A SITE WHERE THERE'LL SOON BE BUILDING 
HUNDREDS OF NEW HOMES TO SHOW HIM HOW BORROWING TO BUY MASSIVELY BOOSTS REWARDS AND RISKS 
HE'S LOOKING TO GET HIS HANDS ON A MID TERRACE HOUSE FOR ONE HUNDRED GRAND 
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN INVESTING PROPERTY YOURSELF YEAH I AM 
SO WHAT'S THE APPEAL FOR YOU OF INVESTING IN PROPERTY 
THE LONG TERM CAPITAL GROWTH IS THE MAIN THING 
IN OTHER WORDS THE PRICE GOING UP SO YOU MAKE MONEY ON IT YEAH 
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU GOT SAVED UP 
I'VE CURRENTLY GOT ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND SAVED UP 
THERE'S YOUR FIVE GRAND 
SUPPOSING YOU DIDN'T TAKE ANY RISKS YOU DIDN'T BORROW ANY MONEY AT ALL 
WHAT SORT OF PROPERTY DO YOU RECKON YOU COULD BUY FOR FIVE GRAND 
NOT A LOT NOT A LOT 
BUT WE HAVE FOUND SOMETHING FOR YOU 
A BEACH HUT LOVELY 
IN ESSEX 
SUPPOSE PROPERTY PRICES GO UP BY TEN PER CENT YOU'LL MAKE FIVE HUNDRED QUID 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON YOU MIGHT SPEND FIVE HUNDRED QUID ON MAYBE A NICE WEEKEND AWAY SOMEWHERE BIT OF SHOPPING 
PRETTY QUICKLY I EXPECT 
BUT WHAT IF PRICES DROP BY TEN PER CENT YOU'VE LOST FIVE HUNDRED QUID 
ALL RIGHT SO I'LL TAKE A FEW NOTES OFF YOU HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT 
NOT SO HAPPY NOT SO HAPPY BUT FIVE HUNDRED QUID IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD 
NO THE THING IS THERE YOU AREN'T REALLY TAKING ANY RISK 
YOU'RE NOT BORROWING MONEY THE CRUCIAL THING WITH PROPERTY 
IS YOU WOULDN'T TAKE THAT FIVE GRAND AND JUST BUY A PROPERTY WITH IT 
INSTEAD YOU'D USE IT AS A DEPOSIT 
NINETY FIVE GRAND THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
ENOUGH TO BUY YOUR MID TERRACED HOUSE 
NOW PRICES GO UP BY TEN PER CENT HOW MUCH IS YOUR HOUSE WORTH 
ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND SEEMS LIKE EASY MONEY DOESN'T IT 
TEN GRAND IF ADAM SELLS NOW HE'LL HAVE ENOUGH TO REPAY THE MORTGAGE AND MAKE A TIDY PROFIT 
YOU HAD FIVE THOUSAND YOU NOW HAVE FIFTEEN YOU'VE TREBLED YOUR MONEY YEAH 
SO BY BORROWING MONEY BY GEARING UP 
YOU'VE MASSIVELY INCREASED THE AMOUNT YOU CAN MAKE ON RISING PRICES 
IF YOU WERE GOING TO SPEND THE MONEY WHAT WOULD YOU SPEND IT ON 
MAYBE A NICE YEAR AWAY TRAVELLING AROUND AMERICA 
NOW SUPPOSE THAT INSTEAD OF RISING BY TEN PER CENT PRICES FALL BY TEN PER CENT 
YEAH YOUR ONE HUNDRED GRAND PLACE IS NOW WORTH 
NINETY THOUSAND NINETY THOUSAND 
I'M THE BANKER I WANT MY MONEY BACK 
I WANT NINETY FIVE GRAND BACK 
THIS DEPOSIT YOU PUT DOWN SORRY THAT'S MINE 
AND HAVE YOU GOT ANOTHER FIVE GRAND SOMEWHERE 
YEAH WELL I'D HAVE TO FIND IT EVEN IF I DIDN'T HAVE IT 
HOW EASY WOULD IT BE FOR YOU TO FIND FIVE GRAND 
NOT THE EASIEST THING TO DO STRAIGHTAWAY BUT I'D HAVE TO GET IT 
IF YOU'RE GOING INTO PROPERTY DOES IT FEEL LIKE A SOLID INVESTMENT 
YEAH DEFINITELY YEAH 
EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE SEEN WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN I STILL FEEL EVEN THOUGH IT IS A RISK 
IT WOULD BE A GOOD INVESTMENT IN THE MANSFIELD AREA THE HOUSE PRICES HAVE SHOT UP THAT MUCH LATELY 
I'M OBVIOUSLY KEEN TO INVEST IN SOMEWHERE I'M WORRIED 
I'LL MISS THE BOAT BEFORE LONG AND THERE'LL BE NO POINT IN BUYING SOMEWHERE FOR A BUY TO LET 
ADAM'S FAITH IN PROPERTY IS IMPRESSIVE 
AND HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S WILLING TO STEP UP THE RISKS TO MAKE MONEY 
THERE'S A WHOLE NEW INDUSTRY BUILT UP AROUND BUY TO LET 
PROPERTY INVESTMENT CLUBS SELL THE IDEA OF GETTING RICH QUICK 
YOUR TOTAL SOLUTION TO BUYING PROPERTY BELOW MARKET VALUE 
THAT'S A BIG PROMISE BUILD YOUR PROPERTY EMPIRE 
NOW IS THE TIME 
YOU HAVE TO SPECULATE TO ACCUMULATE STILL HAPPY TO DO THAT NOW 
I'D STILL BE HAPPY TO DO THAT NOW PARTICULARLY IN A MARKET THAT IS POTENTIALLY DECLINING 
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A GOOD TIME TO BUY 
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON WHICH MAKES ME REALLY QUITE UNEASY 
THERE'S THIS ALMOST RELIGIOUS ZEAL ABOUT THE PLACE 
I'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY ABOUT HOW YOU CAN MAKE MILLIONS 
OUT OF PROPERTY WITHOUT PUTTING ANY OF YOUR OWN MONEY DOWN 
BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYBODY TALK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF LOSSES THAT YOU COULD ALSO MAKE OUT OF PROPERTY 
WHAT THE PROPERTY INVESTMENT SHOWS WON'T TELL YOU IS BY USING OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY 
YOU RUN THE RISK OF BLOWING YOUR MONEY FASTER THAN ANY OTHER INVESTMENT YOU'RE LIKELY TO MAKE 
DEVELOPERS PAY BIG PRICES FOR CITY CENTRE SITES LIKE THESE IN BIRMINGHAM 
TO MAKE IT PAY THEY NEED TO OFFLOAD THEIR FLATS QUICKLY IDEALLY BEFORE THEY'VE EVEN BEEN BUILT 
HOW THROUGH PROPERTY CLUBS 
HOW MANY NEW BUILD FLATS AROUND HERE 
THOUSANDS REALLY I MEAN EVERYWHERE YOU CAN SEE 
NICK TADD'S WORKED INSIDE ONE 
AND HE'S SEEN FIRST HAND THE PRESSURE PUT ON PEOPLE TO BUY 
I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE GO TO THE BACK OF THE ROOM 
AND LITERALLY FORTY FIVE MINUTES LATER WALK AWAY WITH SIX PROPERTIES 
AND A COMMITMENT BORROWINGS OF 
ON SIX YOU'VE GOT TO BE LOOKING UPWARDS OF A MILLION HAVEN'T YOU 
IS IT SAFE TO INVEST IN AN OFF PLAN PROPERTY 
THE TERM OFF PLAN INVESTING IS PERPLEXING COS IT'S NOT REALLY INVESTING 
OFF PLAN IS GAMBLING AT ITS OUTSET 
IT MEANS YOU BUY SOMETHING BEFORE IT'S COMPLETED WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT 
YOU'VE GOT NO IDEA WHAT THE VALUATION IS GOING TO BE ON COMPLETION D'YOU HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL 
D'YOU KNOW WHAT PROPERTY'S GOING TO BE VALUED AT NEXT YEAR I DON'T 
TODAY NICK WANTS TO SEE HIS INDUSTRY CLEANED UP 
THE REINS DO NEED TO BE PULLED ON PEOPLE WHO ARE SELLING 
NEED TO BE SELLING WITH A VIEW THAT THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE 
IF YOU SELL PEOPLE A PENSION YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL 
THAT IT'S SUITABLE AND THERE ARE REGULATIONS BUT THERE AREN'T HERE 
THIS IS THE CRAZY THING ABOUT THIS INDUSTRY THE IRONY IS THAT I CAN'T SELL YOU A PENSION 
OR ANY FORM OF FUTURE FINANCE BECAUSE I NEED TO BE REGULATED 
YET I CAN GO AND SELL YOU TEN OF THEM AND I CAN SELL YOU THE BUY TO LET MORTGAGE PRODUCTS AS WELL 
AND THAT WILL CRIPPLE YOU QUICKER THAN A PENSION WILL 
THIS INDUSTRY NEEDS TO BE REGULATED THAT'S FACT 
THE THING WITH BUY TO LET INVESTMENTS IS YOU'RE SUPPOSED 
TO GET ENOUGH IN RENT TO COVER THE MORTGAGE AND OTHER COSTS LIKE THE CHANCE THAT TENANTS AREN'T THERE 
ONE MONTH THE REPAIRS YOU NEED TO MAKE 
BUT INCREASINGLY THERE'S HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF INVESTORS 
WHO ARE LOSING MONEY FROM DAY ONE BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY CAN'T GET ENOUGH RENT TO COVER THEIR COSTS 
BANKS LENT THEM MORTGAGES KNOWING THEY'D BE LOSING MONTH TO MONTH 
LENDERS LIKE NORTHERN ROCK EVEN MADE A VIRTUE OF IT 
I'VE GOT THE KEYS TO A FLAT WHICH WAS OFFERED TO AN ARMCHAIR INVESTOR AS A GREAT BARGAIN 
BUT WILL IT FETCH ENOUGH RENT 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
MAIN LIVING SPACE I'D PROBABLY SPEND MOST OF MY TIME ON THAT SOFA THERE 
OVER HERE THE KITCHEN SPACE 
THE OWNER OF THIS PLACE WAS LED TO BELIEVE 
THAT HE COULD GET ONE THOUSAND A MONTH RENT FOR IT 
KEY TEST HOW MANY BEDROOMS 
A FAIR SIZED ROOM 
EN SUITE BATHROOM GOOD SO FAR 
BEDROOM NUMBER TWO 
ER NO BEDROOM THERE 
NOW LOCAL LETTING AGENTS HAVE TOLD ME THAT TO GET ONE THOUSAND A MONTH 
YOU'D NEED A THREE BED FLAT WITH OUTSIDE SPACE AS WELL 
WHAT YOU'VE GOT HERE YOU'D BE LUCKY TO GET SEVEN HUNDRED A MONTH 
THIS IS A BAD INVESTMENT 
I'VE COME TO SEE THE LANDLORD OF THAT FLAT 
HE COULD PROBABLY USE A BIT OF INEXPENSIVE HOSPITALITY 
MATTHEW BETTISON IS AN IT CONSULTANT WHO GOT SUCKED INTO THE BUY TO LET GAME AT A WEEKEND EVENT 
WHICH PROMISED PROFESSIONAL GUIDANCE 
MATHEW HELLO HI WELCOME 
THERE HE WAS SOLD MEMBERSHIP OF A FINDERS' CLUB WHERE HE'D BE OFFERED HAND PICKED BARGAIN FLATS' 
I THOUGHT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD DEAL TO ME I COULD LEARN TO DO IT 
THESE PEOPLE HAVE DONE IT FOR YEARS THEY MUST KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING 
IF THEY PRESENT ME WITH FIGURES THEY MUST BE TRUE 
SO IT'S THIS IDEA OF BEING AN ARMCHAIR INVESTOR 
YEAH I LOVED THAT IDEA 
I WAS JUST HOOKED ON IT I WAS TOTALLY HOOKED 
I WAS REALLY YOU KNOW MY EARS WERE WIDE OPEN TO THIS INFORMATION AND I WAS JUST CAUGHT ON IT 
AND THEN THE MOMENT CAME TO MAKE A DECISION WERE YOU UNDER PRESSURE AT ALL 
YEAH THE DEAL WAS YOU EITHER DO IT NOW OR YOU LOSE IT 
AS BLACK AND WHITE AS THAT 
MY WIFE AT THE TIME WAS SAYING I JUST DON'T WANT THIS I JUST WANT TO GO AWAY FROM IT 
AND I JUST WANTED 
I WAS SO DRIVEN BY GETTING THIS DEAL YOU KNOW NOT LOSING THE DEAL 
WHEN HE FIRST REALISED HE WAS LOSING MONEY MATTHEW HOPED RISING RENTS WOULD COME TO HIS RESCUE 
THEY DIDN'T HE'S SHELLED OUT FIFTY THOUSAND TO COVER HIS COSTS 
NOW HE'S DECIDED TO SELL THE FLATS HOW MUCH MONEY WILL HE RECOVER 
AFTER ALL HE'S HAD THEM FOR FIVE YEARS AND PROPERTY'S GONE UP ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
THEY'RE EXACTLY THE SAME AS WHAT I BOUGHT THEM FOR 
BUT HANG ON YOU WERE BUYING THEM AT A DISCOUNT I WAS I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE DISCOUNT WENT 
IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN A TRUE DISCOUNT 
DO YOU BEAT YOURSELF UP ABOUT IT YEAH WHEN THE WIFE'S NOT DOING IT I DO YEAH 
I MADE SOME STUPID STUPID DECISIONS 
I WAS BUYING INTO A FLAT WORTH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
I SHOULD HAVE PUT SOME EFFORT INTO THAT 
AT AUCTION NEW BUILD FLATS ARE TWENTY SIX PER CENT DOWN 
NO WONDER THEN THAT MOST LENDERS NOW INSIST ON A FORTY PER CENT DEPOSIT ON NEW FLATS 
THAT'S PULLED THE RUG FROM UNDER THE PROPERTY CLUBS THAT RAKED IN BUMPER PROFITS WHILE THE BOOM LASTED 
THE BIGGEST SEMINAR COMPANY INSIDE TRACK WENT INTO ADMINISTRATION TWO WEEKS AGO AND WE'VE LEARNED 
OF THREE FURTHER CLUBS THAT HAVE GONE BUST IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
THIS IS DEFINITELY THE LIFE 
IT'S JUST GLORIOUS 
IT CERTAINLY LOOKS MORE INVITING THAN A HIGH RISE IN BRITAIN 
BUT IS BUYING ABROAD ANY MORE LIKELY TO BE A SOLID INVESTMENT 
HIGH PRICES IN THE U. K. HAVE TEMPTED MANY OF US TO SELL UP AND MOVE OVERSEAS 
OWNING YOU OWN PLACE ABROAD HAVING YOUR DREAM HOME IN THE SUN 
IT JUST SEEMS TO BE SO MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE NOW 
THE BRITISH EMBASSY RECKONS THERE ARE NOW ONE MILLION BRITS JUST LIVING HERE IN SPAIN ALONE 
AND WHEN YOU'RE OUT HERE YOU CAN KIND OF SEE WHY 
I COULD REALLY REALLY GET USED TO THIS LIFE 
I MEAN WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE 
SEVEN YEARS AGO RICHARD AND WENDY KALETA SOLD THEIR HOME IN BRITAIN' 
WELCOME TO SUNNY SPAIN THANK YOU 
YOU HAVE AN ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL HOME 
IT WAS NO GOING BACK 
THEY WERE GOING TO GET ON THE SPANISH PROPERTY LADDER AND RETIRE IN THEIR VERY OWN PLACE IN THE SUN 
AND THEY HAD GRAND DESIGNS BUILDING THEIR DREAM HOME FROM SCRATCH 
BUT IN SPAIN AS EVERYWHERE IT'S ALL ABOUT LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION 
WHEN WE BOUGHT THIS LAND THIS LAND WAS BARREN 
YOU BUILT THE GARDEN DID YOU 
I BUILT EVERYTHING 
I'VE PLANTED EVERY SINGLE PLANT FROM OLIVE TREES TO FIG TREES 
WE'VE GOT NEARLY THREE THOUSAND TREES AND PLANTS HERE 
OH THAT'S A LOT OF GARDENING 
A LOT OF GARDENING A LOT OF WORK BUT GOD IT'S BEAUTIFUL I LOVE IT 
BUT IT'S GONNA GO 
RICHARD AND WENDY'S HOME IS UP FOR DEMOLITION 
THEY'RE WAITING FOR A DATE WHEN THE BULLDOZERS MOVE IN 
THIS ACTUALLY IS THE BOUNDARY OF OUR PARTICULAR LAND HERE 
THE RAILWAY LINE IF I POINT YOU IN THAT DIRECTION WHICH IS TOWARDS ALMERIA 
THE RAILWAY LINE WILL BASICALLY COME STRAIGHT ACROSS HERE 
STRAIGHT THROUGH OUR HOUSE HERE 
HEART WRENCHING 
WE CAME OUT HERE FOR THE SUNSHINE THE WEATHER THE WAY OF LIFE AND JUST TO ENJOY OURSELVES 
BUT NOW THAT'S GONE 
ACROSS SPAIN BRITONS HAVE BEEN GIVEN BUILDING LICENCES THAT AREN'T WORTH THE PAPER THEY'RE WRITTEN ON 
TODAY THOUSANDS OF HOLIDAY HOMES FACE POSSIBLE DEMOLITION 
THE KALETAS HAVE PLOUGHED THEIR LIFE SAVINGS INTO THIS PROPERTY 
AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT COMPENSATION IF ANY THEY'LL RECEIVE 
HOW DARE THEY CONDEMN US TO OUR PARTICULAR SITUATION 
WE'RE HERE WAITING FOR THE HAMMER TO FALL 
AND THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT 
IT MAKES ME VERY ANGRY ME AND MY WIFE HAVE PUT 
FIVE YEARS OF OUR LIFE INTO THIS PROJECT 
FOR NOTHING FOR ABSOLUTELY NOTHING 
FEAR OF DEMOLITION HAS SHATTERED BUYER CONFIDENCE 
NOW SPAIN'S HOLIDAY HOME BOOM HAS TURNED TO BUST 
HALF THE COUNTRY'S ESTATE AGENTS HAVE CLOSED AND PRICES IN SOME AREAS HAVE FALLEN BY SIXTY PER CENT 
SUE IRVINE HAS WITNESSED FIRST HAND BOTH THE CONSTRUCTION EXPLOSION AND THE PRICE COLLAPSE 
IT WAS HER DREAM TO PAINT THE SURROUNDING COUNTRYSIDE THAT FIRST BROUGHT HER HERE 
FIVE YEARS ON SHE HAS TO FIND NEW INSPIRATION 
WHAT WAS HERE WHEN YOU MOVED IN 
THIS AREA WAS ORANGE AND LEMON GROVES 
WE HAD THAT WOODLAND ALL THE WAY ALONG WAS WOODLAND 
WHERE ALL THESE MULTI COLOURED MONSTROSITIES ARE 
DID YOU THINK IT WOULD STAY THAT WAY WE WERE TOLD IT WOULD STAY WE WERE TOLD IT WAS GREEN LAND 
WHAT'S IT DONE TO THE VALUE OF YOUR PLACE 
PRESUMABLY WITH A NICE WOODLAND VIEW IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE DESIRABLE 
I THINK IF WE WANTED TO SELL NOW 
WE WOULD POSSIBLY SELL IT FOR LESS THAN WHAT WE PAID FOR IT 
NOT ALL SPANISH HOLIDAY HOMES FACE DEMOLITION 
OR THE BLIGHT OF OVERBUILD 
BUT PLENTY ARE NO LONGER LOOKING THE SOLID INVESTMENT THEY ONCE SEEMED 
BACK HOME A THIRD OF ALL PENSIONERS WILL AT SOME POINT DOWNSIZE 
TO TURN BRICKS AND MORTAR INTO CASH 
IN PORTISHEAD NEAR BRISTOL MEL AND PAULINE BOUGHT THEIR THREE BED HOME IN THE SEVENTIES FOR TWENTY ONE GRAND 
IT WAS RECENTLY VALUED AT THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
IT'S BEEN A SOLID INVESTMENT ALTHOUGH PRICE RISES WON'T HELP THEIR GRANDCHILDREN AFFORD A HOME 
BUT IF MEL AND PAULINE CAN DOWNSIZE NOW WHILE PRICES ARE STILL HIGH 
THEY'D MAKE SOME MONEY THAT MIGHT HELP THE YOUNG ONES OUT 
THEY'VE PUT THEIR HOME ON THE MARKET FOR THREE HUNDRED SIXTY 
WE'VE ONLY HAD ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE PEOPLE LOOK AT THE HOUSE 
AND WE'VE NOW REDUCED IT BY TEN THOUSAND 
NO OFFERS MADE NO 
D'YOU THINK CUTTING IT BY TEN THOUSAND WILL BE ENOUGH TO GET IT MOVING 
NO I DID SAY TO THE ESTATE AGENT YOU COULD REDUCE THIS TO THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE HUNDRED TWENTY 
HE SAID THERE'S NO POINT BECAUSE NO ONE'S OUT THERE WHO'S GONNA BUY IT 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT 
IT'S A DILEMMA REALLY 
WE CAN'T MAKE PEOPLE COME THROUGH THE DOOR 
AND WE CAN ONLY WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE 
BUT WE'RE NOT PARTICULARLY WORRIED IF IT DOESN'T COME BACK UP AGAIN NEXT YEAR 
WE'LL JUST HANG ON WE'RE NOT IN ANY DESPERATE SITUATION TO MOVE 
SO WE'LL JUST HANG ON IN THERE 
LIKE MANY PENSIONERS MEL AND PAULINE ARE STILL IN A GOOD POSITION 
WHEN THEY BOUGHT THEIR HOME THEY NEVER DREAMED THEY'D MAKE THE LONG TERM GAINS THEY HAVE 
THEY'VE SEEN HOUSE PRICES SOAR AND THE GAMBLE NOW IS SIMPLY WHEN TO MAXIMISE THEIR PROFITS 
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE PROPERTY A GUARANTEED BET FOR THE NEXT GENERATION 
OVER THE LAST DECADE MORE PEOPLE HAVE INVESTED IN PROPERTY TO PROVIDE 
AN INCOME IN RETIREMENT THAN HAVE TAKEN OUT A PRIVATE PENSION 
AN ENTIRE GENERATION HAS BEEN SEDUCED INTO THINKING PROPERTY IS AS GOOD AS A PENSION IS IT 
LUCY NANDRIS HAS JUST HAD A WINDFALL INHERITANCE 
AND BOUGHT HERSELF A ONE BED FLAT AS A PENSION 
SHE WANTS TO KNOW IF SHE'S DONE THE RIGHT THING AND I'M GOING TO WALK HER THROUGH IT 
YOU'RE HOPING THAT YOUR BUY TO LET INVESTMENT IS GOING TO PAY FOR YOUR PENSION 
YEAH THAT'S THE IDEA THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING AND HOPING 
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT 
WELL PROPERTY I THOUGHT AND PROPERTY IN LONDON SURELY THE PRICE OF IT MUST GO UP 
THAT'S WHAT I KIND OF JUST ASSUMED AND ALL MY FRIENDS THINK YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA 
SO I THOUGHT I'D INVEST IN PROPERTY 
SO YOU'RE JUST DOING IT ON A HUNCH YEAH 
SO YOUR INITIAL INVESTMENT 
WAS TWENTY THOUSAND RIGHT 
AND YOU'VE USED THAT AS A DEPOSIT YES 
TO BUY A BUY TO LET FLAT 
FOR NINETEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED MM HMM 
WE'VE CALCULATED THAT BY THE TIME YOU RETIRE IN ABOUT THIRTY YEARS' TIME 
THE VALUE OF YOUR FLAT WILL BE 
SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND 
FANTASTIC NOW WE HAVEN'T PLUCKED THAT NUMBER OUT OF THIN AIR 
WE'VE USED THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN ASSUMPTIONS 
THAT'S A NICE TIDY SUM FOR ME TO RETIRE ON 
I'M QUITE LOOKING FORWARD TO MY RETIREMENT NOW 
UNFORTUNATELY I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE SOME OF IT AWAY 
I'M GOING TO TAKE BACK EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND 
FOR THAT'S FOR CAPITAL GAINS TAX 
THEN OF COURSE THERE'S ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND GOING BACK IN 
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MUCH YOU'VE BORROWED MM HMM 
I'M AFRAID I'VE GOT SOME MORE BAD NEWS FOR YOU O. K. 
PRICES WILL HAVE GONE UP QUITE A LOT SO ONCE YOU STRIP OUT INFLATION 
HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW 
THAT'S NOT FEELING SO GOOD 
AND I'M JUST ABOUT TO MAKE THINGS A LITTLE BIT WORSE FOR YOU 
JUST IMAGINE THAT THINGS DON'T GO YOUR WAY IN THE HOUSING MARKET 
JUST IMAGINE THAT HOUSE PRICES RISE BY JUST ONE PER CENT LESS THAN WE ASSUMED 
SO NOT MUCH COULD EASILY HAPPEN RIGHT 
SO LET'S TAKE 
YOUR INVESTMENT NOW HAS FALLEN TO A POT OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO THOUSAND 
DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO LAST YOU IN YOUR RETIREMENT 
MM WELL 
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE AN AWFUL LOT 
PLUS IT'S GOT TO LAST ME WELL AS LONG AS POSSIBLE I SUPPOSE 
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU'LL NEED YOUR PENSION FOR 
WELL MY GRAN JUST TURNED NINETY NINE THIS YEAR SO 
SO YOU'VE GOT GOOD GENES 
GOT GOOD GENES SO IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO LAST ME THIRTY FOUR YEARS ISN'T IT 
THAT'S ONLY GOING TO BE ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND A YEAR 
WELL I'M WONDERING IF IT'S ACTUALLY WORTH IT 
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE DONE A BIT MORE PLANNING 
I THOUGHT I WAS PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE 
AND GOING FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS YOU KNOW 
A SURE FIRE THING PROPERTY PRICES GO UP IN LONDON DON'T THEY 
THEY KEEP CLIMBING UP SO IT'S A BIT WORRYING AND DISAPPOINTING 
TO FIND THAT ACTUALLY THERE'S A LOT MORE TO IT THAN I THOUGHT 
WELL THERE'S A LOT LESS TO IT THAN I THOUGHT ACTUALLY 
I'VE SENT LUCY TO GET SOME PROPER FINANCIAL ADVICE 
THERE ARE PENSION PLANS THAT CAN DELIVER BIG RETURNS WITH BETTER TAX INCENTIVES AND LESS HASSLE 
I'M APPROACHING THE END OF MY JOURNEY AND THIS OLD FASHIONED VAN EATS PETROL 
AT ONE POINT ONE OH A LITRE I'M STARTING TO CRAVE A BIT OF FUEL EFFICIENCY 
WITH OIL ABOVE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS A BARREL ENERGY BILLS AREN'T GETTING CHEAPER EITHER 
HERE IN CORNWALL THERE'S A COUPLE WHO KNOW ALL ABOUT CONSERVING RESOURCES 
AND THEY RECKON BY INVESTING IN ECO FEATURES YOU CAN MAKE YOUR HOUSE EASIER TO SELL IN FUTURE 
THIS IS MY WIFE NICKY HI NICKY NICE TO MEET YOU 
ROBIN AND NICKY ARE SPENDING A PENNY TO SAVE A POUND 
THIS IS THE BATHROOM AND WE'VE USED NATURAL MATERIALS WHICH IS SLATE FROM HERE IN CORNWALL 
O. K. SO THAT'S LOCAL SLATE 
IT IS YEAH IT'S VERY SMART BUT WHAT'S ECO ABOUT IT 
THE TOILET WE FLUSH WITH RAINWATER 
WHICH WE COLLECT IN A STORAGE TANK WHICH IS BURIED IN OUR GARDEN 
YOU GET ENOUGH RAIN PLENTY OF RAIN 
BUT IT'S FUTURE PROOFED SO THAT IT CAN SWITCH TO THE MAINS IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RAINWATER 
BUT AT THE MOMENT WE'VE HAD NO PROBLEM I'M RELIEVED TO HEAR IT 
SOLAR PANELS HEAT BOTH THE HOT WATER AND THE UNDER FLOOR HEATING 
THERE'S SOLID INSULATION AND THE WHOLE HOME HAS BEEN BUILT USING LOCAL MATERIALS' 
IT'S DESIGNED FOR US BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO DESIGN FOR THE FUTURE 
OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LIVE HERE SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HOW OTHER PEOPLE LIVE 
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK YEAH IT'S GREAT 
SO HOW MUCH D'YOU RECKON YOU'VE SPENT ON ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS AND WHAT ARE THEY PAYING BACK 
THE SOLAR PANELS WOULD HAVE COST ABOUT TWO THREE THOUSAND 
THE HEAT RECOVERY ABOUT ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
ADDITIONAL INSULATION MIGHT HAVE COST ANOTHER TWO GRAND 
SO BETWEEN FIVE AND SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WE'VE YOU KNOW WE'VE INVESTED IN THIS HOUSE ON THESE FEATURES 
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THAT'S ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY 
PROBABLY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND IS THE INCREASE IN VALUE OF THIS HOUSE BECAUSE OF ITS ECO FEATURES 
SO YEAH I THINK IT'S BEEN A WORTHY INVESTMENT YOU KNOW 
BUT IF PRICES CARRY ON SLIPPING AS THEY HAVE BEEN CAN YOU BE SURE 
THAT IT'S WORTHWHILE DOING ALL THAT WORK AND ALL THAT HEADACHE 
I THINK SO 
I THINK YOU KNOW THE ENERGY PRICES ARE GOING UP AT SUCH A RATE 
THAT ULTIMATELY JUST MAKING A HOUSE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT 
IS GONNA PAY BACK EASILY 
INVESTMENTS IN GREEN TECHNOLOGY MIGHT ADD A LITTLE TO THE HOUSE PRICE AND SHRINK THE BILLS 
BUT WHAT THEY'RE REALLY SPENDING MONEY ON IS THE KNOWLEDGE THEY'VE SHRUNK THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT 
IT'S THE ULTIMATE LONG TERM INVESTMENT 
BEFORE I FINISH I'VE GOT ONE MORE LOCATION I WANT TO SEE 
IT'S PROMOTED AS ONE OF THE MOST EXCLUSIVE PLACES 
IN THE WORLD AND IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE THAN MONTE CARLO 
MIAMI MILAN OR THE MALDIVES 
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT FROM THE GLOSSY AERIALS BUT THIS IS THE U. K. 
WELCOME TO SANDBANKS ON THE EDGE OF POOLE IT'S A DEVELOPERS' PARADISE 
SANDBANKS IS WELL AND TRULY ON THE INTERNATIONAL MAP SO IT'S WIN WIN WIN REALLY 
LOCAL ESTATE AGENT TOM DOYLE HAS MADE HIS FORTUNE ON THE PROPERTY BOOM HERE 
HE'S CREATED AN AIR OF STATUS 
ABOUT THE PLACE THAT'S PUT A PREMIUM ON PRICES 
LAND IS WAY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IT'S INHERENTLY WORTH 
BUT HOW SOLID IS AN INVESTMENT THAT'S BUILT PARTLY ON ASPIRATION 
YOU NOTICE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE WE SOLD THIS TEN MILLION 
THAT HOUSE IS UP FOR SALE AT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION 
THAT LITTLE PIECE OF LAND THAT'S FOUR MILLION 
THE NUMBERS ARE CRAZY 
I MEAN YOU'RE JUST PLUCKING SIX SEVEN EIGHT TEN MILLION IT'S MADNESS 
WELL I SUPPOSE IT'S A MAD AREA 
BUT IT'S SUPPLY AND DEMAND 
IF PEOPLE ARE STILL BUYING IT'S WORTH WHAT SOMEONE IS PREPARED TO PAY 
IF PEOPLE ARE PREPARED TO PAY THE MONEY THAT'S YOUR VALUE 
THERE MUST BE A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH PRICES ROUND HERE CAN RISE 
YEAH THERE IS A LIMIT 
BUT I DON'T THINK WE'VE REACHED THAT LIMIT YET 
IT'S ITALIAN IT'S THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD 
TOM'S BROUGHT ME TO A LITTLE BARGAIN HE'S KEEN TO SHOW OFF 
THIS IS THE ULTIMATE SURPRISE 
THIS IS WHAT YOUR PAYING YOUR FOUR POINT TWO FIVE MILLION FOR 
THIS IS A GREAT PARTY ROOM 
HOW LONG HAS THE PROPERTY MARKET IN SANDBANKS BEEN THIS BONKERS 
FROM ABOUT TWO THOUSAND JUST BEFORE TWO THOUSAND WHAT HAPPENED THEN 
WE SOLD A PROPERTY ON THE BEACH AN APARTMENT IT WAS ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT AND WE SOLD IT FOR ONE MILLION 
WHICH WORKED OUT AS SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE A FOOT 
AND WE MARKETED THAT AND IT JUST SO HAPPENED THAT IT WORKED OUT 
THAT SANDBANKS WAS THE FOURTH MOST EXPENSIVE PLACE IN THE WORLD 
SO YOU'RE THE MAN WHO CREATED THE SANDBANKS MYTH 
WELL YOU COULD SAY THAT IT'S SIMPLE BECAUSE IT'S HERE 
IT'S FOR REAL IT'S DELIVERING THE DREAM THIS IS THE DREAM AND I CAN DELIVER IT 
AND YOU FIT INTO THAT DREAM 
I MEAN YOU DRIVE THE CAR YOU PERPETUATE THAT DREAM AS WELL 
MY JOB 
MY VISION IS TO SELL THE DREAM 
WE HAVE TO HAVE THE OPULENT OFFICES WHICH YOU KNOW WE HAVE 
WE HAVE TO DRIVE THE EXPENSIVE CARS BECAUSE THAT'S ALL PART OF THE IMAGE 
ALL PART OF THE RAZZMATAZZ AND THE GLITZ OF SANDBANKS AND THE SURROUNDING AREA 
DO YOU EVER WORRY THAT IT'S SLIGHTLY EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES AND THAT PEOPLE WILL WAKE UP AND THINK 
TEN MILLION QUID JUST FOR A HOUSE ACTUALLY IT'S NOT WORTH IT 
NO BECAUSE IF YOU'RE RICH AND YOU WANT TO LIVE IN THE BEST AREA THEN THIS IS THE BEST AREA TO LIVE 
BECAUSE YOU SAID SO I'VE PROVED IT 
SPENDING TIME HERE IN SANDBANKS IT REMINDS ME IN SOME WAYS 
OF THE WHOLE OF THE BRITISH PROPERTY MARKET BUT IN MINIATURE 
THERE'S A LIMITED AMOUNT OF LAND AROUND HERE 
YET LOADS OF PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE HERE 
SO IT BECOMES A SIMPLE CASE OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND THE PRICES GO UP 
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT IS THE SAME ACROSS THE WHOLE COUNTRY 
WE'RE A PRETTY SMALL ISLAND BUT POPULATION IS GROWING AND PRICES GET PUSHED UP 
BUT YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE TO IT THAN THAT 
TAKE THIS PLACE IF YOU BUY A HOUSE HERE YOU'RE SAYING SOMETHING 
ABOUT YOURSELF YOU'RE SAYING I'VE MADE IT 
AND I WONDER IF THERE ISN'T JUST A LITTLE ELEMENT OF THAT IN ALL OF OUR DECISIONS TO BUY PROPERTY 
IN THIS COUNTRY IT SEEMS TO CONFER SOME KIND OF STATUS ON YOU IT SAYS 
THAT YOU BELONG BUT HOW MUCH ARE YOU REALLY WILLING TO PAY FOR THAT DREAM FOR THAT SENSE OF BELONGING 
IS THERE A SORT OF COLLECTIVE MADNESS HAS IT ALL GONE JUST A BIT TOO FAR 
LAND'S END IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER AND FINALLY I'VE CAUGHT UP WITH JENNY 
SO IS PROPERTY A SOLID INVESTMENT 
IF YOU CAN SIT TIGHT IN THE LONG RUN IT LOOKS PROMISING 
BUT THE NEXT FEW YEARS ARE A DIFFERENT MATTER 
PROPERTY IS LUCRATIVE BECAUSE IT'S RISKY 
AND IT'S ALL ABOUT TIMING 
LOOK AT IT WITH YOUR HEAD AND PRICES HAVE OVERSHOT 
BUT THE TRUTH IS WE ALSO USE OUR HEARTS TO PLACE A VALUE ON PROPERTY 
AND IT'S OUR COLLECTIVE OBSESSION WITH HOME OWNERSHIP THAT'S DRIVEN PRICES SO HIGH 
AS LONG AS WE ALL STAY HOOKED ON PROPERTY PRICES WON'T HAVE FAR TO FALL 
BUT IF WE LOSE INTEREST IT'LL BE THE ONES WHO CAN'T HANG ON 
FOR THE LONG TERM WHO'LL TRULY PAY THE PRICE OF OUR PROPERTY OBSESSION 
SO WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNT ON YOUR TRIP 
I'VE BEEN AMAZED PEOPLE HAVE WATCHED HOUSE PRICES SLIPPING 
IN RECENT MONTHS AND SOME PEOPLE I'VE MET HAVE LOST THOUSANDS OF POUNDS 
BUT YET THEY STILL LOVE THEIR PROPERTY IT HASN'T PUT THEM OFF 
IT'S MORE LIKE THEY'VE JUST SPIED A FEW FLAWS 
AND YET THEY HAVEN'T FALLEN OUT OF LOVE 
AT LEAST NOT YET
