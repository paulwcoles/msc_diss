TREE IN WOODLAND ABOUT MILE FROM

NECK THE POLICE SAY THE CAUSE OF 
HER DEATH WAS HANGING A POSTMORTEM 
HAS BEEN ORDERED INTO THE BODY THAT 
WAS DISCOVERED HERE YESTERDAY 
ANTHONY BARTRAM THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH MUCH 
THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR SAYS GORDON 
BROWN'S PLEDGE TO HELP THOSE 
AFFECTED BY THE ABOLITION OF THE 
TEN PENCE RATE IS UNRAVELLING THE 
PRIME MINISTER HEADED OFF A BE 
BELLION BY PROMISING TO GIVE MORE 
MONEY TO TO PEOPLE WHO WOULD LOSE 
THE MOST 
THE TORIES SAY IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT 
EVERYONE WILL GET THE BACKDATED 
COMPENSATION COMPENSATION FARES ARE TO BECOME SIMPLER TRAIN 
OPERATORS ARE SCRAPPING A A RANGE 
OF TICKETS WHICH THEY SAY CONFUSE 
THE CUSTOMER OFF PEAK SUPER OFF 
PEAK SAVER HALF SAVER BUSINESS 
SAVER ADVANCE FIRST ADVANCED 
STANDARD THE LIST IS ENDLESS 
BRITAIN HAS RECORD NUMBERS OF RAIL 
PASSENGERS AND IT SEEMS RECORD 
NUMBERS OF TICKET TYPES 
IN SOME WAYS TRAVELLING BY TRAIN 
HAS GOT MORE EXPENSIVE AND CHEAPER 
IT DEPENDS ON THE FARE PASSENGERS 
LIKE THE CHEAP TICKETS BUT DON'T 
LIKE THE CONFUSION WHICH IS WHY 
THEIR VIEWS FORCED THE RAIL 
INDUSTRY TO ACT THERE WILL BE JUST 
THREE TYPES ANY TIME THE FULLY 
FLEXIBLE AND FULL PRICED FARE OFF 
PEAK A LITTLE CHEAPER FOR QUIETER 
TRAINS AND ADVANCE THE DISCOUNT 
TICKET YOU BOOK IN ADVANCE 
THE THREE CATEGORIES WILL BE USED 
BY ALL OF BRITAIN'S TRAIN COMPANIES 
IT IS A MATTER OF BALANCE IT IS 
CLEAR THAT THE CHEAP DEALS AND 
LOWER RAIL FARES HAVE IN MANY CASES 
RESULTED IN HIGH GROWTH IN THE USE 
OF THE RAIL NETWORK AND WE HAVE 
SEEN GROWTH OVER THE PAST TWELVE 
YEARS BUT THERE HAS TO BE A 
BALANCE WE RECOGNISE NOW THAT WE 
HAD GOT TO THE POSITION WERE THERE 
WERE TOO MANY RAIL FARES AND WE 
NEEDED TO HAVE A SIMPLER NATIONAL 
STRUCTURE STRUCTURE THE POPULAR SAVER FARE WILL 
DISAPPEAR TRAIN COMPANIES INSIST 
IT WILL BE PROTECTED UNDER THE NEW 
OFF PEAK FARE THE GOVERNMENT'S 
POLICY IS TO MAKE TRAVELLERS PAY 
MORE FOR THE RAILWAYS AND TAXPAYERS 
LESS SO WHATEVER THEY ARE CALLED 
FARES ARE GOING TO RISE 
VIOLENCE AGAINST BABIES AND 
CHILDREN HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED 
ACCORDING TO A SURVEY OF ACCIDENT 
AND EMERGENCY UNITS IN ENGLAND AND 
WALES OVER EIGHT THOUSAND CHILDREN SUFFERED 
INJURIES IN THE LAST YEAR VIOLENCE 
AGAINST PEOPLE HAS FALLEN AS ANDY 
TIGHE EXPLAINS 
VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN IS 
NOTHING NEW AS THIS RECENT CAMPAIGN 
VIDEO FROM THE NSPCC SHOWS NOW 
THERE IS EVIDENCE FROM ACCIDENT AND 
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS SHOWING BIG 
INCREASE OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS 
THE SURVEY OF TWENTY NINE HOSPITALS FOUND 
THE OVERALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
TREATED FOR VIOLENCE WAS DOWN BY 
TWELVE PER CENT BUT VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN 
WAS UP BY ONE HUNDRED TWELVE PER CENT IN THE CONFUSING 
DEBATE ABOUT CRIME TODAY'S FIGURES 
ARE INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY 
MEASURE VIOLENT INJURY HERE AT THE 
HOSPITAL WHEN AN EVENT IS STILL 
FRESH IN THE MIND OF THE VICTIM 
AND THE AUTHORS OF TODAY'S REPORT 
ADMIT THAT THE UNEXPECTED RISE IN 
CHILD VICTIMS IS CAUSE FOR CONCERN CONCERN SOME EXPERTS HAVE LONG ARGUED THAT 
CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE ARE 
INVISIBLE VICTIMS BECAUSE THEY 
DON'T SHOW UP IN MANY CRIME 
STATISTICS STATISTICS IT SEEMS THAT AT A TIME WHEN MOST 
PEOPLE SEEM PREOCCUPIED WITH 
CHILDREN COMMITTING CRIME AND 
VIOLENCE THIS REALLY IS A TIME TO 
WAKE UP AND REALISE HOW MANY 
CHILDREN ARE EXPERIENCING VIOLENCE 
AS VICTIMS AND THE DAMAGE THAT IT 
CAUSES CAUSES TODAY'S SURVEY COMES AS THE 
GOVERNMENT PUBLISHES ITS OWN LATEST 
CRIME FIGURES 
THE THREE BIGGEST POLICE FORCES IN 
THE COUNTRY HAVE ALREADY ANNOUNCED 
THAT OVERALL RECORDED VIOLENCE IS 
FALLING 
THE HIGH COURT WILL DECIDE TODAY 
WHETHER THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING 
HAS THE POWER TO RULE THE BANK 
CHARGES ARE UNFAIR A TEST CASE WAS 
BROUGHT AGAINST EIGHT BANKS AND 
BUILDING SOCIETIES AFTER THOUSANDS 
OF CUSTOMERS COMPLAINED THAT 
OVERDRAFT CHARGES WERE TOO HIGH AND 
UNREASONABLE IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 
BANKS MAKE THREE POINT FIVE BILLION FROM 
CHARGES EVERY YEAR 
THE OLYMPIC TORCH IS BEING CARRIED 
CANBERRA ON THE LATEST LEG OF ITS 
TRIP AROUND THE WORLD THERE WERE 
SCUFFLES BETWEEN POLICE AND PRO 
TIBETAN PROTESTERS A POLICE 
PRESENCE PREVENTED ANY MAJOR 
PROBLEMS PROBLEMS BRITAIN'S BUTTERFLIES ARE FIGHTING 
FOR SURVIVAL THERE HAS BEEN THE 
LOWEST NUMBER OF RECORDED SIGHTINGS 
FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS SEVERAL ARE ON THE 
BRINK OF EXTINCTION AND MAY NOT 
SURVIVE EVEN IF THERE IS MILD 
DRY SUMMER 
WHO COULD FORGET THE WASHOUT THAT 
WAS THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE WETTEST 
SINCE RECORDS BEGAN WELL THE RAIN 
WASN'T JUST HUMAN DISASTER IT 
HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON BRITISH 
WILDLIFE ESPECIALLY OUR BUTTERFLIES 
THESE CREATURES DON'T EAT OR BREED 
IN THE RAIN THEY NEED DRY WEATHER 
TO BE ABLE TO REPRODUCE AND TO 
REACH THE PLANTS ON WHOSE NECTAR 
THEY FEED NEW FIGURES FOR TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
REVEAL BRITISH BUTTERFLIES SUFFERED 
THEIR WORST YEAR FOR OVER QUARTER 
OF A CENTURY SEVENTY PER CENT WERE IN DECLINE 
AND EIGHT SPECIES WERE AT AN ALL 
TIME LOW INCLUDING THE COMMON BLUE 
THE LULLWORTH SKIPPER AND IN 
CARLISLE THIS BUTTERFLY WAS EXTINCT 
UNTIL LOCAL CONSERVATIONISTS 
GATHERED UP THE FEW REMAINING 
CATERPILLARS WHEN THEY TURNED INTO 
BUTTERFLIES THEY WERE ENCOURAGED TO 
MATE WITH A SCOTTISH SPECIES THEN 
THOUSANDS OF BABY CATERPILLARS WERE 
RELEASED INTO THEIR NATURAL HABITAT 
BRITAIN'S BUTTERFLIES NEED MILE 
DRY SUMMER THIS YEAR AND GARDENERS 
ARE URGED TO HELP BY CHOOSING 
NECTAR FLOWERING PLANTS SUCH AS 
BLUEBELLS TO HELP IMPROVE THE 
BUTTERFLIES CHANCES 
WILDLIFE EXPERTS IN FLORIDA 
CAPTURED AN EIGHT FOOT LONG 
ALLIGATOR FROM THE HOUSE OF A 
FRIGHTENED PENSIONER 
IT IS THOUGHT THE CREATURE PUSHED 
ITS WAY THROUGH TWO DOORS BEFORE 
STROLLING THROUGH THE LIVING ROOM 
DOWN THE HALL HALL AND INTO THE 
KITCHEN SMASHING CROCKERY IN ITS 
WAKE NO ONE WAS INJURED AND IT WAS 
TRAPPED AND REMOVED 
IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS NOT GOING 
ANYWHERE ANYWHERE HOW DID IT SMASH THE CROCKERY 
IMAGINE YOU GOT UP IN THE MIDDLE OF 
THE NIGHT 
GOING DOWN FOR CUP OF COFFEE AND 
THAT'S IN YOUR KITCHEN 
OR IT COULD HAVE BEEN HER HUSBAND

THEY SAID HE BETTER BE GOOD GOOD 
BECAUSE BARRY SAID OTHERWISE MY 
WIFE IS GOING TO GIVE IT IN THE 
EAR EAR YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO BE HIM WOULD 
YOU NO HE HAS A LOT TO LIVE UP TO 
OH WE'RE A BIT OF A DITHER THIS 
MORNING BECAUSE THERE WAS 
SOMETHING WE WERE TRYING TO FIND 
I'VE FOUND IT 
I KNOW I'M BORING 
BUT NO 
THE DAILY MAIL HAS THE ARTICLE THAT 
CHEAP FOOD IS BEING DRESSED UP AS 
EXPENSIVE AND COSTING CUSTOMERS SEVENTY 
MILLION MILLION AND THE DAILY TELEGRAPH HAS A 
PICTURE OF A SCHOOL CLOSURE POSTER 
THE AVERAGE PAY OF A NEW TEACHER 
NOW IS TWENTY THOUSAND AND THERE IS CHAOS 
AS TEACHERS SHUT SCHOOLS AND 
ALISTAIR DARLING'S FIRST BUDGET 
WILL DOUBLE CAR TAX BUT REDUCE 
EMISSIONS BY LESS THAN ONE PER CENT 
APPARENTLY APPARENTLY AND THE TIMES SAYS THERE ARE NEW 
CHALLENGES TO GORDON BROWN'S 
AUTHORITY AFTER BEING HUMBLED INTO 
THE BIGGEST U. TURN ON A POLICY IN 
HIS PREMIERSHIP 
AND COUPLES WHO LIVE TOGETHER AND 
BUY A HOME MUST NOW SPLIT THE 
PROCEEDS EQUALLY IF THEY BREAK UP 
AND ALL THE PAPERS ARE SPECULATING 
WHETHER BILLY PIPER IS PREGNANT 
AND THIS PAPER LEADING ON THE STORY 
OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE BODY OF 
JAMES HUGHES AFTER HIS MOTHER WAS 
FOUND EARLIER IN THE WEEK AND AMY 
WINEHOUSE HAVING A BIT OF TROUBLE 
GETTING HOME FROM A NIGHTCLUB THE 
OTHER NIGHT 
AND THIS SAYS IS IT TIME TO GIVE 
UP THE SEARCH FOR A CURE FOR AIDS 
NOW AFTER BILLIONS AND POUNDS SPENT 
ON IT 
AND PORTRAITS ARE ALL THE RAGE NOW 
THIS IS A NEW ONE OF TONY BLAIR 
WHAT DO YOU THINK 
HE'S VERY 
PENSIVE 
I THINK IT CAPTURES HIM PENSIVE VERY WELL IT CAPTURES A CERTAIN 
MOOD 
HE LOOKS TERRIBLY CONCERNED MOOD THOUGH DOESN'T HE 
YES WELL IT'S 
TOWARDS THE END OF HIS TIME AND 
SINCE HE HAS HAD ONE DONE WE'RE 
HAVING ONE DONE BY TOM COATES WHO 
IS BEAVERING AWAY RIGHT NOW 
HELLO DECLAN WHERE YOU ARE HELLO HELLO I'M IN BELFAST THIS MORNING AND 
DOING THE BUSINESS NEWS FROM HERE 
TODAY SO I CAN SHOW YOU HOW THE 
ECONOMY HERE HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED 
IN THE PAST TEN YEARS OR SO 
THE SWITCH FROM THE OLD ECONOMY TO 
THE NEW ECONOMY YOU CAN SEE EVEN 
JUST LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER 
AWAY IN THE DISTANCE THERE SEE THE 
BIG YELLOW CRANES THEY THE 
LANDMARK OF THE BELFAST SKYLINE 
THEY ARE THE CRANES FROM THE OLD 
HARLAND AND WOLFF SHIPYARD WHICH 
USED TO BE THE BIGGEST EMPLOYER 
HERE AND THIS BUILDING IS THE 
VICTORIA SQUARE SHOPPING CENTRE IT 
IS THE LARGEST COMMERCIAL 
DEVELOPMENT THAT NORTHERN IRELAND 
HAS EVER SEEN IT HAS EXTENDED CITY 
CENTRE SHOPPING SPACE BY A THIRD 
SO YOU SEE THE SWITCH FROM OLD TO 
NEW BUT THERE IS ANOTHER REASON 
WE'RE STOOD IN THIS PARTICULAR 
SHOPPING CENTRE IS BECAUSE WHEN I 
WAS GROWING UP IN THIS PART OF THE 
WORLD MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO THIS 
WAS NOT THE TYPE OF BUILDING YOU 
WOULD HAVE EVER SEEN NO ONE WOULD 
HAVE CONSIDERED BUILDING A PROJECT 
OF THIS SCHEME BECAUSE OF THE 
VIOLENCE SO WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT 
DEVELOPMENT IN THE PAST TEN YEARS 
THEY MEAN PROJECTS LIKE THIS SO 
WE'VE SEEN A BIG JUMP IN WEALTH IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE IN WORK AND A HUGE INCREASE 
IN HOUSE PRICES BUT THERE ARE 
STILL NEGATIVE FACTORS THERE IS AN 
OVERRELIANCE ON THE GOVERNMENT AND 
PUBLIC SECTOR LOCALLY THERE IS 
STILL CONCERN THAT THERE ARE TOO 
MANY YOUNGSTERS LEAVING SCHOOL 
WITHOUT ENOUGH SKILLS AND THERE IS 
ALSO AN ISSUE ABOUT THE 
PRODUCTIVITY OF LOCAL BUSINESSES 
SO THOSE ARE THE TYPE OF ISSUES 
WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT DURING OUR 
MORNING HERE IN BELFAST I'LL SEE 
YOU IN HALF AN HOUR 
NOW THE WEATHER DO WE HAVE THE 
WEATHER THINK WE'RE DOING THE 
HEADLINES FIRST WHAT HAS GONE 
WRONG THIS MORNING 
WE'RE CONFUSED 
WE HAVEN'T HAD OUR COFFEE 
THESE ARE THE MAIN STORIES THIS 
MORNING THE FIRST NATIONAL 
TEACHERS' STRIKE FOR MORE THAN TWENTY 
YEARS GETS UNDER WAY TODAY EIGHT THOUSAND 
SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND AND WALES WILL 
BE AFFECTED TWO MEN ARE BEING 
QUESTIONED ON SUSPICION OF 
MURDERING JAMES HUGHES SEVERELY 
DISABLED MAN WHOSE MOTHER WAS FOUND 
DEAD THREE DAYS AGO ALSO COMING 
UP COULD THE LOCAL ELECTIONS BE 
DECIDED BY RUBBISH WE'LL FIND OUT 
HOW REF USE AND RECYCLING COULD 
AFFECT THE RESULTS ON POLLING DAY 
CAN WE DO THE WEATHER NOW PLEASE 
YES 
GOOD MORNING YES IT WILL BE ANOTHER PLEASANTLY WARM 
DAY TODAY ONCE YOU SEE THE 
SUNSHINE BUT COMPARED TO YESTERDAY 
TEMPERATURES A LITTLE LOWER THAN 
THEY WERE THANKS TO A BREEZE ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY THAT BREEZE WILL ALSO 
BRING SOME 
IT IS QUITE A BIG AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE COMING IN FROM THE WEST 
AND YOU CAN JUST SEE THAT BAND OF 
RAIN EDGING ACROSS THE U. K. AS WE 
SPEAK SOME HEFTY DOWNPOURS IN THAT 
BAND OF RAIN AS IT PUSHES INTO 
WALES AND THE WEST OF SCOTLAND BUT 
IT SHOULD CLEAR THROUGH QUICKLY 
CLEARING THE EAST COAST BY THIS 
AFTERNOON AND THAT WILL BE 
FOLLOWED BY BRIGHTER MOMENTS BUT 
THERE WILL BE SHOWERS SOME OF WHICH 
COULD BE HEAVY AND THUNDERY SO 
YOU COULD HAVE A DOWNPOUR ONE 
MINUTE AND HOPEFULLY THE SUN COMING 
OUT AFTERWARDS ACROSS SCOTLAND 
MORE IN THE WAY OF CLOUD DURING THE 
DAY PARTICULARLY THE NORTH AND THE 
WEST THEY'LL HOLD ON TO CLOUDY 
CONDITIONS WITH SHOWERY RAIN BUT 
BRIGHTER IN EASTERN AREAS AND SOME 
HEAVY SHOWERS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
WHICH COULD HAVE A RUMBLE OF 
THUNDER IN THEM ACROSS WALES AND 
THE SOUTH WEST SOME SUNSHINE SOME 
SHOWERS BUT IN THE SECOND HALF OF 
THE DAY MORE IN THE WAY OF 
BRIGHTER SUNNY SPELLS FOR THE 
REST OF THE COUNTRY MISTY AND 
MURKY IN ONE OR TWO SPOTS EARLIER 
ON AND A LITTLE RAIN BUT BRIGHTER 
LATER AND A MILD NIGHT WITH RAIN 
IN THE NORTH AND WEST TOMORROW DO 
YOU SEE THAT THE BLOSSOM MATCHES 
HIS SHIRT 
GORDON BROWN FACES HIS FIRST 
ELECTION AS PRIME MINISTER NEXT 
WEEK NOT A GENERAL ELECTION BUT 
ALL WELLING COUNCILS AND MANY 
ENGLISH ONES ARE GOING TO THE POLLS 
BUT ARE VOTERS GETTING STIRRED UP 
BY THE CREDIT CRUNCH OR THE 
SCRAPPING OF THE TEN P. TAX RATE OR 
ARE THEY MORE CONCERNED WITH 
RUBBISH JO COBURN IS AT A DEPOT 
WHERE THE TRUCKS ARE SETTING OUT ON 
THEIR ROUNDS 
HELLO IT MAY NOT BE A GLAMOROUS 
LOCATION FIRST THING IN THE MORNING 
BUT WHAT AN IMPORTANT JOB WE ALL 
NEED OUR RUBBISH COLLECTED SO WILL 
IT BE THE BATTLE OF THE BINS AT 
THIS YEAR'S LOCAL ELECTIONS OR WILL 
PEOPLE BE GETTING CONCERNED ABOUT 
WIDER ISSUES 
I WENT TO WORCESTER TO FIND OUT 
WHAT THEY ARE GETTING EXERCISED 
ABOUT ON THE STREETS 
WE MAY BE IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL 
CREDIT CRUNCH BUT HERE IN 
AUTHENTIC MIDDLE ENGLAND IN 
WORCESTER IT IS RUBBISH THAT IS 
DIVIDING THE TOWN THE WEEKLY 
COLLECTION WAS SCRAPPED FOR A 
FORTNIGHTLY COLLECTION OF ONE WEEK 
THE REF USE AND THE NEXT WEEK 
RECYCLING THE HUMBLE DUSTBIN IS AN 
ISSUE WHERE THE ACTIONS OF THE 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES TRULY MATTER AND 
GALVANISES THE PUBLIC ON THE 
DOORSTEP SANDRA LIVES IN A TERRACE 
HOUSE WITH LITTLE ROOM FOR THE TWO 
LARGE WHEELIE BINS THAT SHE NEEDS 
FOR HER COLLECTIONS THE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS WILL BE A CHANCE FOR HER 
TO VOICE HER OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT 
SHE THINKS ONE A HEALTH HAZARD 
IT IS 
UNPLEASANT AND SMELLY ESPECIALLY IN 
THE WARM WEATHER AND I'VE SEEN 
RATS AND I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE OF 
THE FORTNIGHTLY BIN COLLECTIONS 
THIS IS WHERE LABOUR MAY PICK UP 
VOTES CAMPAIGNING FOR THE WEEKLY 
COLLECTIONS TO BE BROUGHT BACK 
BUT THEY LOST IN TWO THOUSAND DESPITE 
HOLDING ON TO THE PARLIAMENTARY 
SEAT IN THE HEADY DAYS OF ONE HUNDRED NINETY NINE 
WHEN THIS MIDLANDS TOWN SWUNG 
TOWARDS TONY BLAIR AND NEW LABOUR 
THE VOTES HAVE DRIFTED AWAY SO THE 
VOTES OF WORCESTER WOMEN COULD BE 
UP FOR GRABS 
THEY STILL EXIST BUT 
THEY ARE TEN O. ELEVEN YEARS WISER AND 
WHETHER THEY ARE STILL ENAMRED OF 
LABOUR NOW ONLY TIME WILL TELL 
THE GOVERNMENT'S CURRENT 
DIFFICULTIES COULD HELP TORY 
TACTICS ON THE DOORSTEP THEY ARE 
IN CHARGE HERE BUT ONLY WITH A 
MINORITY OF ADMINISTRATION DESPITE 
SOME FALLOUT OVER THE BIN ISSUE 
THE PARTY IS STICKING TO 
FORTNIGHTLY COLLECTIONS AND SOME 
PEOPLE AGREE 
IF YOU RECYCLE IT 
PROPERABLY THERE IS NO TALK OF THIS 
BINS OVERFLOWING AND RATS AND ALL 
THAT RUBBISH 
RECYCLING IS GOOD AND 
MAKES YOU AWARE OF HOW MUCH YOU ARE 
THROWING AWAY AND IT IS EASY TO CUT 
IT DOWN 
WHILE LABOUR AND THE 
TORIES HOLD ENTRENCHED POSITIONS IN 
THIS DEBATE THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 
ARE WORKING TOWARDS A COMPROMISE 
BUT THEIR BIG ISSUES ARE THE TOWN'S 
MONEY AND HOW IT IS BEING SPENT IT 
MAY COME DOWN IN THESE LOCAL 
ELECTIONS OVER WHO REIGNS IN THE 
TOWN HALL OR IN WESTMINSTER 
SO WILL IT BE ABOUT LOCAL ISSUES 
OR WILL PEOPLE VOTE THE WAY THEY DO 
IN GENERAL ELECTIONS WILL IT BE 
RUBBISH THAT DRIVES PEOPLE TO THE 
POLLING STATIONS NEXT WEEK AND THE 
OTHER BIG ISSUE WILL BE TURNOUT ON 
THE DAY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WE ARE FEELING RATHER SELF 
CONSCIOUS THIS MORNING BECAUSE 
WE'RE HAVING OUR PORTRAIT PAINTED 
IT IS ALL THE RAGE IT IS AND IF I 
KNEW I WOULDN'T HAVE WORN THIS 
SHIRT SHIRT TOM COATES IS HERE WITH US THIS 
MORNING TOM IS THERE ANY OTHER 
WAY YOU WANT US TO SIT 
IN MY 
DREAMS I WOULD LOVE YOU TO BE 
SITTING PROPERLY BUT YOU HAVE TO 
BE MOVING L. HAVE TO GET USED TO 
YOU YOUR PHYSICAL PRESENCE 
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST 
YOU HAVE 
DONE A LOT ALREADY 
IT IS A TINY 
LITTLE STUDY TO GET THE COLOUR 
NOTES READY TO GO TO A LARGER ONE 
IF I HAD MY WAY I WOULD HAVE DONE 
A BIGGER ONE 
I LIKE US BLURY 
THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO LOOK AT US 
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING NOW THE 
LOCAL NEWS WHERE YOU ARE 
GOOD MORNING FROM B. B. C. LONDON 
KEN LIVINGSTONE DID HAVE PLAN TOSS 
RAISE TUBE AND BUS FARES AFTER THE 
ELECTION B. B. C. LONDON HAS LEARNT 
LAST AUTUMN HE CATEGORICALLY SAID 
NO FARE INCREASES WOULD BE 
NECESSARY EITHER FOR CROSSRAIL OR 
ANY OTHER PROJECT BUT AT THE TIME 
HE HAD AGREED WITH OFFICIALS IN 
TRANSPORT FOR LONDON TO INCLUDE 
INCREASES IN THEIR LATEST SPENDING 
PLANS BUS FARES WERE TO GO UP BY 
FIVE PER CENT AND TUBE FARES BY FOUR PER CENT BUT AFTER 
HIS COMMENTS THOSE CONSIDERATION 
HAD TO BE REMOVED 
AROUND SIXTY PER CENT OF THE CAPITAL'S TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
SCHOOLS WILL BE FULLY OR PARTIALLY 
CLOSED BECAUSE OF TODAY'S STRIKE 
MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF 
TEACHERS ARE WALKING OUT OVER PAY 
THEY SAY IT IS PARTICULARLY 
RELEVANT FOR TEACHERS IN LONDON WHO 
FACE A HIGHER COST OF LIVE LIVING 
TWO MEN ACCUSED OF MANSLAUGHTER 
AFTER HITTING FIVE TODDLER ON A BEACH 
IN THE BAHAMAS HAVE BEEN CLEARED OF 
MANSLAUGHTER GENERALLY SPEAKING IT IS GOOD NEWS 
ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT BUT PROBLEMS 
IN THE MIDLANDS 
ELSEWHERE TUBES AND TRAINS ARE 
RUNNING O. K. BY THE WAY IT IS 
NATIONAL WALK TO WORK DAY TODAY SO 
IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE THE CAR BEHIND 
YOU MIGHT AS WELL BECAUSE THE M. TWENTY FIVE 
IS SLOW AS USUAL AND IT'S SLOW ON 
THE BLACKWALL TUNNEL SOUTHERN 
APPROACH 
A TWO YEAR RENOVATION PROJECT ON 
ONE OF LONDON'S MOST FAMOUS 
CHURCHES IS NEARING COMPLETION SAINT 
MAR CITIZENS IN THE FIELD HAS BEEN 
RESTORED INSIDE AND OUT AS A COST 
OF SIX MILLION 
SAINT MAR CITIZEN'S IN THE FIELD 
NOW THE WEATHER 
GOOD MORNING IT IS ANOTHER MISTY 
AND MURKY MORNING OUTSIDE AND IT 
WILL REMAIN CLOUDY AND THEN A BAND 
OF WET WEATHER WILL SWEEP THROUGH 
LATER IN THE MORNING THROUGH THE 
AFTERNOON IT WILL BECOME BRIGHTER 
BUT THEN WE'LL SEE SOME SCATTERED 
SHOWERS DEVELOP WITH A RISK OF HAIL 
AND THUNDER AND THE BRISK WESTERLY 
WINDS WILL MAKE IT FEEL 
CONSIDERABLY COOLER THAN YESTERDAY 
SHOWERS CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING 
BUT OVERNIGHT IT WILL BE DRY FOR 
ALL OF US MISTY AND FOGGY AGAIN 
BUT A MILD NIGHT TO COME 
SO AS WE MOVE INTO SATURDAY IT 
LOOKS SET TO BE DRY AND FINE AND NINETEEN 
BUT SOME COME SUNDAY A RISK OF ONE 
OR TWO SHOWERS WE'RE BACK IN HALF 
AN HOUR 
GOOD MORNING THIS IS BREAKFAST 
WITH SIAN WILLIAMS AND BILL 
TURNBULL TURNBULL THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN ARE GOING TO 
MISS SCHOOL TODAY AS THE FIRST 
NATIONAL TEACHERS STRIKE IN OVER TWENTY 
YEARS GETS UNDERWAY A THIRD OF 
SCHOOLS ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES 
WILL BE AFFECT INDEED A DISPUTE 
OVER PAY BY THE NATIONAL UNION OF 
TEACHERS TEACHERS IT HAS BEEN CONDEMNED BY ALL THE 
MAIN POLITICAL PARTIES 
I DON'T THINK THE PAY CLAIM IS 
REASONABLE GIVEN THE LEVEL OF PAY 
SETTLEMENTS ACROSS THE PUBLIC 
SECTOR THIS YEAR AND GIVEN THE FACT 
THAT THE INDEPENDENT PAY REVIEW 
BODY HEARD THE EVIDENCE FROM THE 
UNIONS AND GOVERNMENT AND COME UP 
WITH THIS RECOMMENDATION A THE 
NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS ARE 
REJECTING AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO 
JUSTIFY CALLING STRIKE THAT DOES 
SO MUCH DAMAGE TO SCHOOLS ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY 
THAT'S THE VIEW OF THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS DEMOCRATS LET'S TALK TO COLETTE HUME WHO 
JOINS US FROM A QUIET SCHOOL IN 
CARDIFF CARDIFF COLLETTE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN 
THERE TODAY WELL WHAT WILL HAPPEN 
HERE IS NOTHING BECAUSE THIS CLASS 
IS CLOSED TODAY AND IT IS ONE OF 
THOUSANDS OF CLASSES THAT HAS BEEN 
CANCELLED ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES 
AS THIS STRIKE ACTION BITES ACROSS 
ENGLAND AND WALES AROUND EIGHT THOUSAND 
SCHOOLS WILL BE CLOSED OR HAVE 
LESSONS CANCELLED WHY ARE THE 
TEACHERS ON STRIKE THEY WANT A PAY 
RISE THE NUT THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST 
TEACHING UNION WANTS A PAY RISE OF 
FOUR POINT ONE PER CENT THE UNION SAYS THAT WOULD PUT 
IT IN LINE WITH INFLATION 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED THE 
TEACHERS' TWO E. N. FORTY FIVE PER CENT THIS YEAR WITH 
WITH WITH FURTHER RISES NEXT YEAR 
AND THE YEAR AFTER THE UNION SEAS 
THAT'S NOT A ENOUGH THAT'S A PAY 
CUT AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE 
STRIKE THE NUT SAYS THE STRIKE IS 
A LAST RESORT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS 
THAT THE OFFER THEY HAVE GIVEN THEM 
IS REASONABLE AND FRANKLY THEY WANT 
THEM BACK IN THE CLASSROOM 
I THINK SIAN AND BILL THE SIZE OF 
THIS WALKOUT SURPRISED EVERYBODY 
NOT LEAST THE TEACHING UNION WE 
ARE LOOKING AT WIDESPREAD 
DISRUPTION ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES 
TODAY IN SOME COUNTIES OVER HALF OF 
SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED NOW I HAVE 
SPOKEN TO A LOT OF PARENTS MANY ARE 
BROADLY IN SUPPORT OF THE ACTION 
BUT THEY ARE FRUSTRATED ABOUT THE 
LEVEL OF DISRUPTION CERTAINLY IN 
SOME SCHOOLS WHICH ARE PARTIALLY 
OPEN FOR SOME PARENTS THEY ARE 
BRINGING ONE CHILD TO SCHOOL BUT 
HAVING TO STAY AT HOME TO LOOK 
AFTER THE OTHER RALLIES ARE 
PLANNED A I CROSS ENGLAND AND WALES 
ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES TODAY 
TEACHERS SAY THEY WANT THIS PAY 
RISE AND FRANKLY THEY HAVEN'T RULED 
OUT FURTHER STRIKE ACTION IF THEY 
DON'T GET WHAT THEY WANT BUT THE 
GOVERNMENT SAYS THEY ARE HOLDING 
FIRM THE OFFER IS REASONABLE

NEARLY ALL BARCELONA AS THEY TRIED 
TO ESTABLISH A LEAD AHEAD OF NEXT 
WEEK'S SECOND LEG THIERRY HENRY 
AMONGST THE BARCA PLAYERS WHO 
MISSED GOOD CHANCES MANCHESTER 
UNITED MUST SCORE NEXT WEEK IF THEY 
ARE TO MAKE IT AN ALL ENGLISH FINAL 
THEY DIDN'T REALLY MAKE ANY GREAT 
CHANCES IN THE MATCH AND MAYBE 
AFTER HALF TIME THEY HIT THE SIDE 
NET AND THEY GOT TO THE BI LINE 
WHICH WAS CLEARED AND I THINK WE 
HAVE DONE WELL IN TERMS OF REDUCING 
THEIR OPPORTUNITIES 
RANGERS HOPE TO TAKE A LEAD AGAINST 
FIORENTINA FIORENTINA WALTER SMITH'S SIDE IS CHASING FOUR 
TROPHIES BUT LOST BARRY FERGUSON

ENJOYED LUCK ALONG THE WAY BUT NOW

FIRST TIME THAT WE CAN LOOK FORWARD 
TO TWO VERY TOUGH GAMES BUT ALSO 
THE POSSIBILITY OF THE EUROPEAN

AND YOU GET IT ON THE SKULL AND 
CROSS BONES YOU GET SIX POINTS IT 
IS A DIFFERENT FORMAT OF GOLF AND 
IT COULD BE TAKING ACROSS THE WORLD 
BECAUSE OF THE ELEMENT OF RISK AND 
WE MIGHT SEE IT ON THE EUROPEAN 
TOUR LOOK LOOK OUT FOR THAT 
WHY DON'T THEY HAVE LOTS OF THEM 
AND YOU ARE BOUND TO GET A HOLE IN 
ONE ONE A LOTTERY WILL PUT THAT FORWARD 
TO THE COMMITTEE 
MINI GOLF

YES WE ARE HAVING OUR PORTRAIT 
PAINTED BY A LOVELY MAN CALLED TOM

THE REASON IS BECAUSE LOTS OF 
PEOPLE ARE HAVING THEIR PORTRAIT WE 
WANTED TO GET IN ON THE ACT

WANTED TO GET IN ON THE ACT ONES THE ROW OVER THE TEN PENCE INCOME TAX 
RATE OVER GORDON BROWN APPEARED TO 
COMPENSATE THOSE AFFECTED 
GEORGE OSBOURNE SAYS THE DEAL IS 
UNRAVELLING WHY WE ARE JOINED BY 
GEORGE JONES WAS THIS LEVEL 
HEADED REVIEW OR SCREECHING U. TURN 
WELL IT WAS A SCWEECHING U. TURN SCREECHING U. TURN BUT AVOIDED A 
ROAD SMASH GORDON BROWN AVOIDED A 
COMMONS DEFEAT BUT AT COST TO HIM 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PAPERS THEY ARE 
SAYING HE BLINKED FIRST THAT IT IS 
A HUMBLED PRIME MINISTER THAT HE 
LOST AUTHORITY SO IT WAS A VERY 
EXPENSIVE AND POLITICAL AUTHORITY 
TERMS WE HAVE YET GOT TO FIND OUT 
HOW EXPENSIVE IT WILL BE FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT YOU ME AND SIAN THE 
TAXPAYER TAXPAYER AND EVERYBODY ELSE 
AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
AND SOME DEVIL IN THE DETAIL IT 
WOULD APPEAR 
YES THERE ARE BLAND 
ASSURANCES ALISTAIR DARLING SAYING 
HE IS GOING TO LOOK AT THE WORST 
AFFECTED GROUPS THOSE PEOPLE WHO 
RETIRED EARLY BETWEEN SIXTY AND SIXTY FIVE 
PARTICULARLY AT SINGLE YOUNG PEOPLE 
AND LOW PAID FAMILIES WITHOUT 
CHILDREN CHILDREN BUT THERE WERE NO COSTINGS EXCEPT 
THERE WERE ASSURANCES THEY WOULD BE 
LOOKED AT AND COMPENSATION WOULD BE 
BACKDATED BUT FIFTY THREE MILLION PEOPLE 
AFFECTED AND IT DOESN'T LOOK AS IF 
THEY ARE GOING TO BE COMPENSATED 
THE PRINCIPLE REMAINS THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT WOULD THINK THAT IT GOT 
ITSELF OFF THE HOOK AND THE PRIME 
MINISTER PARTICULARLY 
THERE WAS TO 
BE A VOTE IN THE COMMONS ON MONDAY 
ON A REBEL AMENDMENT MOVE BY FRANK 
FIELD AND IT LOOKED AS IF THE 
GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN DEFEATED 
BUT THAT HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN BUT 
THERE ARE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
THIS TO COME BACK WHAT GORDON 
BROWN AND LABOUR NEEDED TO DO WAS 
AVOID A BIG BUST UP BEFORE NEXT 
THURSDAY'S LOCAL ELECTION IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES AND THE LONDON 
MAYORAL ELECTION THIS IS NOT GONE

ACROSS MUCH OF EASTERN BRITAIN IT 
IS A DRY AND BRIGHT START WHILE 
THERE WILL BE SUNSHINE FOR ALL OF 
US IT IS DIFFERENT STORY FURTHER 
WEST WE HAVE THE CLOUD AND THE 
RAIN AND MORE OF A BREEZE TODAY 
WILL BRING THE SHOWERY BURSTS OF 
RAIN ACROSS ALL PARTS ESPECIALLY 
DURING THIS MORNING THE REASON WE 
HAVE GOT THE SHOWERS WITH US TODAY 
IS LOW PRESSURE IN CHARGE THE 
CENTRE OF THAT LOW PRESSURE MAY 
HAVE OFF TOWARDS THE NORTH ATLANTIC 
BUT IT IS LARGE ENOUGH TO BRING THE 
SHOWERS IN 
A COLD FRONT THAT YOU CAN SEE ON 
THE RADAR PICTURE THROUGH THE NIGHT 
BRINGING RAIN ACROSS NORTHERN 
IRELAND WALES AND THE SOUTH WEST 
SOME HEFTY BURSTS AND THAT CAUSING 
SURFACE WATER AND SPRAY ON THE 
ROADS OVER THE NEXT FEW FEW HOURS 
THAT WILL PUSH IN THROUGH SCOTLAND 
THE MIDLANDS AND CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN ENGLAND IT HAS MORE MORE 
MOVEMENT MOVEMENT COMPARED WITH 
YESTERDAY SO SKIES WILL BRIGHTEN 
THE MAIN BAND PUSHING OFF TOWARDS 
THE NORTH SEA BUT SUNSHINE AND 
SHOWERS MORE SHOWERS AROUND THAN 
WE SAW DURING YESTERDAY SOME OF 
THOSE COULD BE HEAVY AND THUNDERY 
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SOUTH WESTERLY 
BREEZE THEY SHOULD PUSH THROUGH 
THROUGH RAPIDLY SO THERE WILL BE 
DRY AND BRIGHT WEATHER AND THERE 
WILL BE ONE OR TWO SPOTS THAT STAY 
DRY DRY EASTERN PARTS OF SCOTLAND SHOULD BE 
BRIGHT THIS AFTERNOON TOWARDS THE 
WEST MORE CLOUD AROUND STILL MORE 
SHOWERS AND STILL A SHOWERY MIX 
ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND WITH JUST 
BIT OF BRIGHTNESS 
TEMPERATURES TODAY LOWER THAN 
YESTERDAY BUT STILL INTO THE MID 
BETWEEN AS THEY WILL BE ACROSS 
WALES AND THE SOUTH WEST 
AND HERE DURING THE AFTERNOON THERE 
SHOULD BE MORE DRIER AND BRIGHTER 
WEATHER THAN SHOWERS 
AND THEN DURING THIS EVENING THE 
SHOWERS SHOULD START TO FADE AWAY 
IT WILL BE DRY FOR MUCH OF THE 
NIGHT A BIT OF MIST AND FOG HERE 
AND THERE BUT IT WILL TURN MURKY 
ACROSS WESTERN AREAS 
BUT TEMPERATURES HOLDING UP ABOVE 
FREEZING THROUGH TONIGHT AND IT 
WILL BE A FAIRLY MILD DAY TOMORROW 
BRIGHTER SKIES ACROSS EASTERN AREAS 
INITIALLY HOLDING ON TO THE 
SUNSHINE ACROSS EAST ANGLIA AND THE 
SOUTH WEST IT WILL BE GLOOMY IN 
PLACES AND NORTHERN IRELAND WILL 
SEE OUTBREAKS OF RAIN 
IT HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER TO TAKE 
PHOTOGRAPHS OF PEOPLE 
BUT THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF PORTRAIT 
PAINTERS WHOSE ANNUAL EXHIBITION 
OPENS TODAY ARGUES THAT 
TRADITIONAL PAINTED PORTRAIT OFFERS 
GREATER INSIGHT

SOFTER THAN THE CHAIR 
WHAT IS IT 
ABOUT PEOPLE WANTING THEIR PORTRAIT 
PAINTED THAT IS NEW 
I DON'T THINK 
IT IS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE GOING 
RIGHT BACK TO THE EGYPTIANS AND THE 
ROMANS THERE ARE SOME WONDERFUL 
PORTRAITS ESPECIALLY WITH THE 
ROMANS AND THEN IT WAS LOST FOR A 
WHILE AND THEN YOU GET THE EARLY 
RENAISSANCE IT WENT SUDDENLY 
PRIMITIVE SO PORTRAITURE WAS 
DIFFERENT IF YOU SEE A LOT OF THE 
TOMBS YOU SEE SOME WONDERFUL 
PORTRAITS VERY THREE DIMENSIONAL

ANGER SORROW WHATEVER BUT A 
PORTRAIT GOES TO A GREATER DEPTH

AND THROW MY STUFF IN THE BACK 
THAT WOKE YOU UP WE'LL TALK TO YOU 
LATER THIS MORNING THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH NOW WE GO TO BELFAST TO JOIN 
DECLAN DECLAN WE'RE IN BELFAST TODAY TAKING A 
LOOK AT THE NORTHERN IRELAND 
ECONOMY EFFECTIVELY I HAVE BROUGHT 
YOU BACK HOME TO SHOW HOW THIS 
PLACE HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED IN 
RECENT YEARS WHY TODAY WELL A 
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THERE WAS THE 
TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GOOD 
FRIDAY AGREEMENT THE POLITICAL 
DEAL THAT PAVED THE WAY FOR THE 
RETURN OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND IN 
TWO WEEKS FROM NOW WE'LL SEE A HUGE 
INVESTMENT CONFERENCE HERE IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND BRINGING IN 
INVESTORS FROM THE U. S. IT IS BEING 
HOSTED BY THE LOCAL FIRST MINISTER 
AND DEPUTY FIRST MINISTER AND THE 
BRITISH AND IRISH PRIME MINISTERS 
WILL BE IN ATTENDANCE AS WELL SO 
THESE ARE CHANGING TIMES FOR THE 
ECONOMY AND IT HAS BEEN 
TRANSFORMED LITERALLY FROM THE 
TIME I GREW UP HERE NEW 
NEW DEVELOPMENTS AND A FRESH CONFIDENCE 
BELFAST ONE REAPING THE BENEFITS OF 
PEACE THINGS HAVE REALLY CHANGED 
IS 
LESS THAN TEN YEARS AGO THIS WAS 
BELFAST AT THE HEIGHT OF THE 
TOURIST SEASON A CITY IN SHUTDOWN 
BECAUSE OF A ROW OVER ORANGE ORDER 
PARADES BUT AS A HOLIDAY 
DESTINATION IT HAS BEEN RE BORN 
TOURISTS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE 
ECONOMY BUT GETTING BIG FIRMS TO 
COME HERE AND SET UP IS ESSENTIAL 
NORTHERN IRELAND IS STILL VERY 
DEPENDANT ON PUBLIC SERVICE JOBS 
AND GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT MONEY 
BUT MANY PENSION FUNDS HAVE SAID 
THEY WILL BE PUTTING TENS OF 
MILLIONS OF POUNDS IN HERE AND AN 
INVESTMENT CONFERENCE WILL BE HELD 
NEXT MONTH MANY COMPANIES WOULD 
HAVE THOUGHT TWICE ABOUT PUTTING 
ANY INVESTMENTS HERE IN THE PAST 
HOWEVER SOME TRADITIONAL 
INDUSTRIES HAVE SUFFERED AT THE 
HANDS OF CHEAPER COMPETITION 
OVERSEAS BUT THE SHIPPING INDUSTRY 
IS STILL HERE AND STILL WORKING 
BUT HARLAND AND WOLFF EMPLOYS ONLY 
A FRACTION OF THE WORKERS IT ONCE 
DID IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAVE 
BEEN DIFFERENT CRANES ALONG 
BELFAST'S SKYLINE THERE HAS BEEN A 
HUGE BUILDING BOOM FUEL BY SOARING 
PROPERTY PRICES 
AND YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THAT 
SKYLINE STRETCHING OUT BEHIND ME 
HERE HERE IS ONE SIGN OF HOW 
THINGS HAVE CHANGED WHEN I WAS 
GROWING UP IN THIS PART OF THE 
WORLD UNEMPLOYMENT WAS THE WORST 
IN THE U. K. IN MY HOME TOWN FOUR PER CENT OF 
MEN WERE NOT IN WORK NOW 
UNEMPLOYMENT IS ONE OF THE LOWEST 
RATES IN THE U. K. SO THERE ARE MANY 
MORE JOBS AND A BIG PREVIOUS IN 
HOUSE PRICES LOUISE BROWN FROM THE 
UNIVERSITY OF ULSTER YOU FOLLOW 
THE HOUSING MARKET CAN YOU GIVE US 
AN IDEA OF HOW BIG THE BOOM IN 
HOUSE PRICES HAS BEEN 
WELL THE 
AVERAGE HOUSE PRICE IS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND 
WHICH REPRESENTS A FAIR AMOUNT OF 
PEOPLE'S INCOMES THE BIGGEST 
INCREASE WE SAW WAS TOWARDS THE 
MIDDLE TO THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WHERE 
THERE WAS A FIFTY PER CENT INCREASE JUST IN 
ONE QUARTER SO QUITE SUBSTANTIAL 
AND THAT HAS MAELD PEOPLE FEEL A 
LOT RICHER MADE PEOPLE FEEL LOT RICHER EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T 
ACTUALLY HAVE THE MONEY TO SPEND 
YES IT HAS AND PEOPLE ARE 
INVESTING IN SECOND PROPERTIES AND AND TOM YOU WANT PEOPLE TO SPEND MORE 
MONEY BECAUSE YOU ARE THE MANAGER 
OF THIS SHOPPING CENTRE IT HAS 
ONLY BEEN OPENED A COUPLE OF WEEKS 
AND WE'RE SEEING A GENERAL SLOWDOWN 
FOR RETAILING SO IT IS A DIFFICULT 
TIME TO OPEN A SHOPPING CENTRE YES YES BUT WE HAVE BROUGHT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION 
INVESTMENT TO THE CITY WITH MANY 
MANY RESTAURANTS 
AND YOU'VE DONE 
IT WITH PRIVATE MONEY IT IS NOT 
GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED AND YOU 
WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN A PROJECT OF 
THIS SCALE EVEN BEING ENVISAGED TEN 
OR TWENTY YEARS AGO 
NO CERTAINLY NOT 
IT IS A HUGE INVESTMENT IN BELFAST 
CITY CENTRE AND REALLY LIFTING 
BELFAST INTO ONE OF THE TOP TEN 
RETAIL CITIES IN THE U. K. NOW THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
WE'LL FOLLOW THOSE THREADS DURING 
THE COURSE OF THE MORNING HERE 
LOTS MORE FROM BENEFITS LATER ON 
BREAKFAST BREAKFAST DECLAN BACK HOME THAT MUST BE 
QUITE NICE FOR HEM NOW HERE IS 
ONE OF OUR MOST FLAMBOYANT SEB

LAST OCTOBER THE PRIME MINISTER 
FINALLY AGREED PLANS FOR THE SIXTEEN 
BILLION CROSSRAIL PROJECT AND KEN

INCREASES IN THEIR LATEST SPENDING 
PLANS WHICH HAD BEEN SIGNED OFF BY 
THE MAYOR BUS FARES WERE TO GO UP

ADDRESS IN THE CHURCHHILL AREA AND 
TWO MEN HAD BEEN ARRESTED ON 
SUSPICION OF MURDER POLICE CORDONS 
WENT UP IN THIS AREA AND THEY HAVE 
REMAINED IN PLACE OVERNIGHT WE 
KNOW THOSE TWO MEN ARE HELPING 
POLICE WITH THEIR INQUIRIES AT TWO 
POLICE STATIONS AT KIDDERMINSTER 
AND REDDITCH THIS CAME AFTER AN 
UNUSUAL POLICE SEARCH WHICH LASTED 
FIVE DAYS FOR A MOTHER AND SON THE 
SON WAS SEVERELY DISABLED UNABLE 
TO FEND FOR HIMSELF AND ENDED WITH 
THE TRAGIC DISCOVERY YESTERDAY OF A 
BODY NOW YESTERDAY THE LAST WE 
HEARD OFFICIALLY FROM THE POLICE 
FORMAL IDENTIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS 
WERE BEING MADE A POSTMORTEM HAD 
BEEN ORDERED NOW WHAT WE KNOW 
ABOUT HEATHER WARDLE JAMES' MOTHER

WOODLAND AT THE BASE OF A TREE WITH 
A LIGATURE AROUND HER NECK NOW

THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR SAYS GORDON 
BROWN'S PLEDGE TO HELP THOSE 
AFFECTED BY THE ABDITION OF THE TEN 
PENCE TAX RATE IS UNRAVELLING 
YESTERDAY THE PRIME MINISTER HEADED 
OFF BACK BACKBENCH REBELLION THE 
CONSERVATIVES SAY IT IS NOT CLEAR 
THAT EVERYONE WILL GET THE 
COMPENSATION THAT THE LABOUR REBELS 
DEMANDED DEMANDED VIOLENCE AGAINST BABIES AND 
CHILDREN HAVE DOUBLED 
MORE THAN EIGHT THOUSAND CHILDREN SUFFERED 
INJURIES IN THE LAST YEAR VIOLENCE 
AGAINST PEOPLE GENERALLY HAS FALLEN 
AS ANDY TIGHE REPORTS 
VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN IS 
NOTHING NEW AS THIS RECENT CAMPAIGN 
VIDEO FROM THE NSPCC SHOWS NOW 
THERE IS EVIDENCE FROM ACCIDENT AND 
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS SHOWING A BIG 
INCREASE OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS 
THE SURVEY OF TWENTY NINE HOSPITALS FOUND 
THE OVERALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
TREATED FOR VIOLENCE WAS DOWN BY 
TWELVE PER CENT TWELVE PER CENT BUT VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN WAS 
UP BY ONE HUNDRED TWELVE PER CENT 
IN THE SOMETIMES CONFUSING DEBATE 
ABOUT CRIME TODAY'S FIGURES ARE 
INTERESTING THEY MEASURE VIOLENT 
INJURY AT THE HOSPITAL WHEN AN 
EVENT IS STILL FRESH IN THE MIND OF 
THE VICTIM AND THE AUTHORS OF 
TODAY'S REPORT ADMIT THAT THE 
UNEXPECTED RISE IN CHILD VICTIMS IS 
A CAUSE FOR CONCERN 
SOME EXPERTS HAVE LONG ARGUED THAT 
CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE ARE 
INVISIBLE VICTIMS BECAUSE THEY 
DON'T SHOW UP IN MANY CRIME 
STATISTICS STATISTICS IT SEEMS THAT AT A TIME WHEN MOST 
PEOPLE SEEM PREOCCUPIED WITH 
CHILDREN COMMITTING CRIME AND 
VIOLENCE THIS REALLY IS A TIME TO 
WAKE UP AND REALISE HOW MANY 
CHILDREN ARE EXPERIENCING VIOLENCE 
AS VICTIMS AND THE DAMAGE THAT IT 
CAUSES CAUSES TODAY'S SURVEY COMES AS THE 
GOVERNMENT PUBLISHES ITS OWN LATEST 
CRIME FIGURES 
THE THREE BIGGEST POLICE FORCES IN 
THE COUNTRY HAVE ALREADY ANNOUNCED 
THAT OVERALL RECORDED VIOLENCE IS 
FALLING

AND APEX ARE ALL ON THE WAY OUT 
DOZENS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRAIN 
TICKET ARE BEING SCRAPPED AND 
REPLACED WITH THREE FULL PRICE 
OFF PEAK AND CHEAPER ADVANCE 
TICKETS TRAIN OPERATORS HOPE THE 
CHANGE WILL AFFECT PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
BEEN CONFUSED BY THE RANGE OF DEALS 
PASSENGER GROUPS SAY THE PRICES ARE 
TOO HIGH 
THE HIGH COURT WILL DECIDE TODAY 
WHETHER THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING 
HAS THE POWER TO RULE THAT BANK 
CHARGES ARE UNFAIR A TEST CASE WAS 
BROUGHT AGAINST EIGHT BANKS AND 
BUILDING SOCIETIES AFTER THOUSANDS 
OF CUSTOMERS COMPLAINED THEIR 
OVERDRAFT CHARGES WERE TOO HIGH AND 
UNREASONABLE BANKS MAKE THREE POINT FIVE 
BILLION FROM CHARGES EACH AND EVERY 
YEAR YEAR THE OLYMPIC TORCH IS BEING CARRIED 
THROUGH CANBERRA ON THE LATEST LEG 
OF ITS TRIP THERE WERE SCUFFLES 
BETWEEN POLICE AND PRO TIBETAN 
SUPPORTERS A HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE 
PREVENTED ANY MAJOR PROBLEMS 
BRITAIN'S BUTTERFLIES ARE FIGHTING 
FOR SURVIVE THIS YEAR SOME SPECIES 
HAD THE LOWEST NUMBER OF RECORDED 
SIGHTINGS FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS IT IS 
CLAIMED SEVERAL ARE ON THE BRINK OF 
EXTINCTION AND MAY NOT SURVIVE EVEN 
IF THERE IS MILD DRY SUMMER 
WHO COULD FORGET THE WASHOUT THAT 
WAS THE SUMMER OF OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE 
WETTEST SINCE RECORDS BEGAN WELL 
THE RAIN WASN'T JUST HUMAN 
DISASTER IT HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON 
BRITISH WILDLIFE ESPECIALLY OUR 
BUTTERFLIES THESE CREATURES DON'T 
EAT OR BREED IN THE RAIN THEY NEED 
DRY WEATHER TO BE ABLE TO REPRODUCE 
AND TO REACH THE PLANTS ON WHOSE 
NECTAR THEY FEED NEW FIGURES FOR 
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN REVEAL BRITISH BUTTERFLIES 
SUFFERED THEIR WORST YEAR FOR OVER 
TWENTY FIVE YEARS SEVENTY PER CENT WERE IN DECLINE AND 
EIGHT SPECIES WERE AT AN ALL TIME 
LOW INCLUDING THE COMMON BLUE THE 
LULWORTH SKIPPER AND THE GRAYLING 
IN CARLISLE THE MARSH BUTTERFLY WAS 
ALMOST EXTINCT UNTIL 
CONSERVATIONISTS GATHERED UP THE 
FEW REMAINING BUTTERFLIES AND THEY 
WERE ENCOURAGED TO MATE WITH 
SCOTTISH SCOTTISH ONES 
BRITAIN'S BUTTERFLIES NEED MILD 
SUMMER THIS YEAR AND GARDENERS ARE 
BEING ASKED TO HELP BY CHOOSING 
PLANTS THAT HELP INCREASE THE 
BUTTERFLIES CHANCES WILDLIFE 
EXPERTS IN IN FLORIDA CAPTURED 
EIGHT FOOT LONG ALLIGATOR FROM 
HOUSE IN FLORIDA IT IS THOUGHT THE 
CREATURE PUSHED ITS WAY THROUGH TWO 
DOORS BEFORE ENTERING THE LIVING 
ROOM NO ONE WAS INJURED AND THE 
ANIMAL WAS TRAPPED AND REMOVED 
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO LEAVE IT THERE 
WOULD YOU 
NO YOU MIGHT TRIP OVER IT FOR A 
START START IT WAS MOVING SLOWLY HOW IT 
MANAGED TO SMASH CROCKERY 
A BIG TAIL 
IT IS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN WE ARE TALKING IT IS 
SEVEN POINT ONE TWO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 
TEACHERS' STRIKE 
IT HAS BEEN CRITICISED AND MANY 
PUPILS ARE WRITING IN AND SAYING 
THEY ARE UNHAPPY AND PARENTS 
WRITING INTO US ONE PERSON WHO IS 
UNHAPPY IS DANIEL BARNARD AND HE E. 
MAILED US TO SAY THAT HE IS WORRIED 
WITH HIS GCSES AROUND THE CORNER 
DANIEL IS HERE ALONG WITH SIMON 
WARR WARR DANIEL HAVE YOU STARTED YOUR GCSES 
WHAT ARE YOU AT NOW 
I HAVE A WEEK 
AND A HALF BEFORE I START MY EXAMS 
SO YOU FEEL THAT THIS STRIKE SHORT 
AS IT IS AT THE MOMENT IS NOT 
HELPING YOUR STUDIES 
NO I'M 
LOSING SIX OR SEVEN HOURS OF MY 
EDUCATION WHICH IS IN A WEEK AND A 
HALF THAT'S A LOT 
YES I HAVE A SON WHO IS IN THE 
SAME YEAR WHO IS DOING THE SAME 
THING WHO IS NOT GOING TO BE GOING 
TO SCHOOL FOR MORE THAN COUPLE OF 
HOURS TODAY CAN YOU REVISE AT HOME 
OR IS IT THAT YOU WANT TO BE IN 
SCHOOL TODAY 
WELL I CAN REVISE AT 
HOME BUT IT IS THE THING OF HAVING 
SOMEONE THERE WHO IS SUPPORTING YOU 
THROUGH THE REVISION THERE IS NO 
POINT OF REVISING THINGS IF YOU ARE 
REVISING THEM WRONG IT IS NO USE 
DOING THAT IF YOU HAVE GOT A 
TEACHER THERE TO SUPPORT YOU IT IS 
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT BETTER 
SIMON YOU ARE NOT WITH THE NUT 
YOU ARE WITH THE NASWT AND YOU 
DON'T SUPPORT THE STRIKE 
I THINK 
IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE AND THE TIMING 
COULDN'T BE WORSE 
I TEACH FRENCH AND THE FRENCH ORALS 
START ON MONDAY AND IT WOULD BE 
CATASTROPHIC AND I USE THE WORD IN 
ITS TRUE MEANING FOR PUPILS TO MISS 
A COMPLETE DAY AT THIS STAGE 
PARTICULARLY IN YEAR ELEVEN TWELVE 
AND THIRTEEN IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE 
OF THE UNIONS TO ASK FOR THIS 
STRIKE WHEN I STARTED TEACHING 
PERHAPS THERE WAS A REASON FOR 
STRIKING ALTHOUGH I NEVER DID BUT 
NOW IN COMPARISON TEACHERS WHO 
JOIN THE PROFESSION HAVE A BETTER 
DEAL AND THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS 
GOING FOR BEING A TEACHER WE ALL 
KNOW ABOUT THE HOLIDAYS BUT THINGS 
LIKE A GOOD PENSION SCHEME AND 
QUITE HONESTLY JOB SECURITY IF 
YOU GO INTO TEACHING THAT'S ONE 
THING THAT IS PRETTY DEFINITE 
YOU'RE NOT LIKELY TO LOSE YOUR JOB 
THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS GOING FOR 
TEACHERS AND I JUST FEEL THAT THE 
UNION TO HAVE CALLED THIS STRIKE IS 
IRRESPONSIBLE IRRESPONSIBLE DANIEL YOU WANT TO GO INTO 
TEACHING DON'T YOU 
YES I DO 
WHEN I LEAVE I WANT TO GO ABROAD 
TO TEACH BUT TEACHING IS 
DEFINITELY IN MY CAREER CHOICE AT 
MOMENT MOMENT DESPITE WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM 
THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS THE 
GRIPES NOT ONLY ABOUT PAY AND 
SAYING THEIR PAY HASN'T GONE UP 
BUT THE WORKLOAD AND THE AMOUNT OF 
HOURS THEY ARE HAVING TO DO OUTSIDE 
OF SCHOOL AND IN THE HOLIDAYS IT 
SEEMS TO YOU THAT THAT TEACHING IS 
AN ATTRACTIVE OPTION 
I THINK THERE 
ARE LOTS OF BENEFITS TO IT JUST 
PASSING ON KNOWLEDGE IT JUST SEEMS 
SO GOOD 
SIMON YOU HAVE BEEN CRITICAL OF 
THE NUT L. L. SUPPOSE THE POINT OF 
INDUSTRIAL ACTION IS TO MAKE THE 
BIGGEST POINT YOU CAN AT THE MOST 
CRUCIAL POINT THAT YOU CAN AND 
PRESUMABLY THAT'S WHY THIS 
I CAN 
SEE WHY THEY ARE DOING IT TO CAUSE 
MAXIMUM DISRUPTION AND THEY ARE 
JUST THINKING ABOUT MONEY L. JUST 
THINK IT IS INCOMPATIBLE WHEN YOU 
ARE TEACHING CHILDREN AND YOU ARE 
ASKING THEM TO WORK HARD TO STAND 
UP IN THE FACE OF DIFFICULTIES TO 
BE SO STUBBORN THAT ACTUALLY AS FAR 
AS ONE'S PAY IS CONCERNED I'M NOT 
SATISFIED WITH THIS EVEN THOUGH 
THE PAY CONDITIONS I MENTIONED ARE 
MUCH BETTER THAN THEY HAVE EVER 
BEEN I HAVE BEEN CRITICAL OF THIS 
GOVERNMENT FOR MANY THINGS BUT YOU 
COULDN'T CRITICISE THEM FOR THE 
AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY HAVE POURED 
INTO THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND A LOT 
OF THAT GOING INTO TEACHERS POCKETS 
AND A YOUNG GRADUATE STARTING HAS A 
GOOD DEAL FOR THE REASONS I HAVE 
MENTIONED BUT AS FAR AS PAY IS 
CONCERNED CONCERNED WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE 
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR GCSES 
THANK YOU FOR CONTACTING US 
YESTERDAY I KNOW YOU WERE REALLY 
WOUND UP YESTERDAY 
WE ARE TALKING TO THE NUT LATER ON 
AND WE'VE HAD SOME MESSAGES IN 
ABOUT IT THIS MORNING YOU JUST DIG 
AWAY AWAY THEY'VE MOVED THE PRINTER 
TEACHERS ARE PAID AN AVERAGE OF 
THIRTY THOUSAND TO WORK ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS 
WHAT MORE DO THEY WANT THIS PERSON 
GETS FIFTEEN THOUSAND AND WORKS TWELVE MONTHS 
NO SYMPATHY WHATSOEVER AND THIS 
ONE SAYS OUR CHILDREN HAVE TO GO 
TO SCHOOL BY LAW SO WHERE DO WE 
STRIKE STAND 
BUT TONY SAYS TEACHERS ARE ONLY 
ASKING FOR M. P.'S FEEL ARE JUSTIFIED 
FOR THEMSELVES FUEL INCREASES AND 
BAS IC FOOD AND THEY'RE NOT ASKING 
FOR IT TO BE BACKDATED AND LOTS 
OF VIEWS AND LOT ARE SAYING 
THERE ARE NOT JUST GCSES BUT S. A. T.'S 
AND OTHER TESTS STILL TO COME 
COULD THE LOCAL ELECTIONS BE 
DECIDED BY RUBBISH WE'LL FIND OUT 
HOW REF USE AND RECYCLING TO AFFECT 
THE RESULT ON POLLING DAY I ALSO 
THIS MORNING THE COMEDIAN RUSSELL 
BRAND TELLS US HOW HE GOT HIS BREAK 
IN AMERICA AND WITH SLIGHTLY 
COMBED HAIR THERE 
AND PINK SHIRT WHICH MATH PUT ON 
TO MATCH THE BLOSSOM THERE 
YES I BLEND IN THIS MORNING IF 
YOU'RE OUT ACROSS YORKSHIRE THIS 
MORNING THERE IS VERY DENSE FOG 
AND IN NORTH WEST ENGLAND THE 
MIDLANDS AND THE SOUTH WEST THERE 
IS VERY HEAVY RAIN SO TAKE CARE ON 
THE ROADS THERE WILL BE A LOT OF 
SURFACE WATER AND SPRAY AROUND 
THE BREEZE TODAY WILL MAKE IT FEEL 
A TOUCH COOLER THAN YESTERDAY AND 
THERE IS THIS LOW OUT IN THE 
ATLANTIC WHICH IS FEEDING GROUND 
FOR THE SHOWERS AND A COLD FRONT IS 
BRINGING THE HEAVIEST RAIN AT THE 
MOMENT IT IS NOW ACROSS THE EAST 
OF WALES THE SOUTH WEST AND THE 
NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND IT WILL 
CONTINUE ACROSS MUCH OF SCOTLAND 
AND ENGLAND DURING THE REST OF THIS 
MORNING BRIGHTER SKIES BEHIND BUT 
UNLIKE YESTERDAY WHERE IT WAS DRY 
WITH THE SUNSHINE TODAY WE'LL SEE 
THE SUNSHINE PUNCTUATED BY HEAVY 
SHOWERS SOME OF THE SHOWERS ACROSS 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ENGLAND AND 
INTO THE NORTH COULD BE HEAVY AND 
THUNDERY BUT THERE WILL BE SOME 
SUNSHINE THROUGH AS THE BREEZE 
PUSHES THE SHOWERS THROUGH FAIRLY 
RAPIDLY MORE DRIER IN THE EAST OF 
SCOTLAND BUT WESTERN SCOTLAND WILL 
SEE MANY MORE SHOWERS THE WETTEST 
CONDITIONS WILL BE DURING THE 
MORNING THERE IS BRIGHTER WEATHER 
DEVELOPING AT THE MOMENT BUT BY 
THIS AFTERNOON ANY SHOWERS WILL 
BECOME FEWER AND FURTHER BETWEEN 
MOST OF THE SHOWERS ARE EASING 
THROUGH THE COMING EVENING AND 
OVERNIGHT IT SHOULD BE DRY A BIT 
MISTY AND MURRAY IN ONE OR TWO 
SPOTS BUT IT WILL BE MILD 
AND IT WILL TURN MURKY TOWARDS THE 
WEST BY THE END OF TONIGHT AND INTO 
TOMORROW MORNING WITH A GREY START 
HERE MOST OF US WILL BE DRY 
INITIALLY WITH BRIGHTER SKIES TO 
THE EAST BUT IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
SCOTLAND AND THE NORTH WEST OF 
ENGLAND THEY'LL SEE HEAVY RAIN 
DEVELOP DEVELOP WARM IN THE SOUTH EAST IN THE 
SUNSHINE SUNSHINE NOW LET'S TALK TO DECLAN IN 
BELFAST 
I HAVE COME HOME TO SHOW YOU HOW 
THE ECONOMY OF THIS PLACE HAS 
CHANGED IN SHORT TIME IF YOU'RE 
SHARP EYED AND LOOKING TOWARDS 
THESE BUILDINGS YOU'LL SEE ONE OR 
TWO THAT ARE VERY GRAND AND 
VICTORIAN BECAUSE THAT IS WHEN 
BELFAST MADE ITS MONEY IT WAS ONE 
OF THE GREAT TRADING CITIES OF THE 
EMPIRE AND MADE ITS FORTUNE FROM 
LYNDEN AND SHIPBUILDING AND YOU 
CAN SEE THE YELLOW CRANES OF THE 
HARLAND AND WOLFF SHIPYARD THAT IS 
ONE OF THE LAND MARKS OF THE 
BELFAST SKYLINE AND USED TO BE ONE 
OF THE MAJOR EMPLOYERS HERE IN 
BELFAST SO WE'VE SEEN A CHANGE 
AWAY FROM THE OLD INDUSTRIES 
TOWARDS THE NEW INDUSTRIES THERE 
IS THE HILTON HOTEL AND A SET OF B. T. 
OFFICES THERE THAT IS THE 
WATERFRONT DEVELOPMENT AND IT WAS 
THE SIGNATURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
NINETEEN NINETIES BUT THE IMPORTANT THING OF 
THAT IS THAT ALL THAT WAS GUN WITH 
GOVERNMENT AND TAXPAYERS' SUPPORT 
IT WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT 
THE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR THE 
SIMPLE REASON THAT THE TROUBLES 
WERE GOING ON THERE WAS YEARS 
OF VIOLENCE WHICH CAUSED DAMAGE TO 
THE ECONOMY AS WELL SO THE 
BUILDING WE ARE IN TODAY IS HUGE 
HUGELY SIGNIFICANT THIS IS 
VICTORIA SQUARE A SHOPPING 
DEVELOPMENT AND THE BIGGEST THAT 
NORTHERN IRELAND HAS EVER SEEN IT 
IS A SIX HUNDRED MILLION PROJECT AND IT'S 
ALL DONE BY PRIVATE MONEY SO WHEN 
WE TALK ABOUT THE PEACE DIVIDEND IT 
IS NOT JUST THAT THERE ARE MORE 
JOBS AND HOUSE PRICES HAVE RISEN 
SHARPLY AND PEOPLE HAVE MORE MONEY 
IN THEIR POCKET BUT THAT 
BUSINESSES ARE NOW TAKING MORE 
BUILDING THE TYPE OF SCHEME 
RISKS BUILDING THE TYPE OF SCHEME THAT FRANKLY NO ONE WOULD HAVE 
EVEN CONSIDERED TO DO WHEN I LIVED 
HERE TWENTY OR YEARS AGO GORDON GORDON BROWN FACES HIS FIRST ELECTION AS 
PRIME MINISTER NEXT WEEK NOT 
GENERAL BUT MANY WELSH AND ENGLISH 
COUNCILS ARE GOING TO THE VOTERS IN 
LOCAL ELECTIONS BUT ARE VOTERS 
GETTING ALL WORKED UP ABOUT THE 
SCRAPPING OF THE TEN P. INCOME TAX OR 
RUBBISH RUBBISH JO COBURN IS AT A RUBBISH DEPOT 
YES AND MOST OF THE LORRIES HAVE 
LEFT FOR THEIR ROUNDS OF 
COLLECTIONS AND IT IS TRUE IT 
COULD BE THE BATTLE OF THE BINS AND 
HOW OUR WASTE IS COLLECTED THAT 
COULD BE THE FOCUS IN THE ELECTIONS 
AND I'VE BEEN TO WORCESTER TO FIND 
OUT WHAT WILL COUNT THERE ON 
POLLING DAY 
WE MAY BE IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBE 
CREDIT CRUNCH BUT HERE IN AUTHOR 
PARTICULAR MIDDLE ENGLAND HOME TO 
WORCESTER WOMAN IT IS THE GREAT 
BIN DEBATE THAT HAS DIVIDED THE 
TOWN THE ONCE WEEKLY RITUAL OF 
COLLECTING THE BINS HAS BEEN 
SCRAPPED FOR A FORTNIGHTLY 
COLLECTION ONE WEEK REF USE AND 
THE NEXT RECYCLING MUCH OF THE 
VOTING AND POLICIES OF LOCAL 
COUNCILS PASSES VOTERS BY EXCEPT 
IN THE CASE OF THE BINS IT IS AN 
ISSUE THAT GALVANISES THE PUBLIC ON 
THE DOORSTEP SANDRA LIVES IN A 
TERRACED HOUSE WITH LITTLE ROOM FOR 
THE TWO LARGE WHEELY BINS SHE MUST 
HAVE IF SHE WANTS HER RUBBISH TO BE 
TAKEN AWAY THE LOCAL ELECTIONS 
WILL BE THE FIRST CHANCE SHE HAS TO 
VOTE AGAINST THE SCHEME WHICH SHE 
SAYS IS A HEALTH HAZARD 
IT SMELLS 
AND IN THE WARM WEATHER IT IS 
UNPLEASANT AND I'VE SEEN RATS 
TWICE NOW AND I THINK THAT IS 
BECAUSE OF THE FORTNIGHTLY BIN 
COLLECTIONS 
THIS IS WHERE LABOUR COLLECTIONS MAY PICK UP VOTES CAMPAIGNING FOR 
WEEKLY COLLECTIONS OF FOOD WASTE TO 
BE BROUGHT BACK BUT THEY HAVE A 
TOUGH JOB ON THEIR HANDS THEY 
LOWEST CONTROL OF THE COUNCIL IN 
TWO THOUSAND DESPITE HOLDING ON TO THE 
PARLIAMENTARY SEAT THE HEADY DAYS 
OF NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WHEN THIS MIDLANDS TOWN 
SWUNG TOWARDS TONY BLAIR AND NEW 
LABOUR HAVE SINCE DRIFTED AWAY SO 
THE VOTES OF WORCESTER WOMEN COULD 
BE UP FOR GRABS 
THEY STILL EXIST 
BUT THEY ARE TEN TO ELEVEN YEARS WISER 
AND WHETHER THEY ARE STILL AS 
ENAMRED OF LABOUR AS BACK THEN 
TIME WILL TELL 
THE GOVERNMENT'S 
CURRENT DIFFICULTIES COULD HELP 
TORY TACTICS ON THE DOORSTEP THEY 
IN CHARGE HERE BUT ONLY A MINORITY 
OF ADMINISTRATION DESPITE SOME 
POLITICAL FALLOUT OVER THE BIN 
ISSUE THE PARTY IS STICKING TO 
FORTNIGHTLY COLLECTIONS AND SOME 
SHOPPERS AGREE 
IF YOU RECYCLE IT 
PROPERABLY THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH 
THE TALK OF BINS OVERFLOWING AND 
RATS AND ALL THAT RUBBISH 
RECYCLING IS GOOD AND IT DOES MAKE 
YOU AWARE OF HOW MUCH YOU ARE 
THROWING AWAY AND IT IS VERY EASY 
TO CUT IT DOWN 
WHILE LABOUR AND 
THE TORIES HOLD ENTRENCHED 
POSITIONS IN THIS DEBATE THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE WORKING 
TOWARDS A COMPROMISE THE THRUST OF 
THEIR CAMPAIGN THOUGH IS ABOUT 
LOCAL FUNDING AND HOW THE TOWN'S 
MONEY IS BEING SPENT IN THE END IT 
WILL COME DOWN TO WHETHER THESE 
ELECTIONS ARE MORE OF A VERDICT 
OVER WHO REINS AT THE TOWN HALL OR 
AT WESTMINSTER 
AND ALL THE LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES ARE HOPING FOR BRIGHT 
SUNNY WARM WEATHER TO BOOST 
TURNOUT ON THE DAY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
JUST A QUICK ONE ON THE TEACHERS 
BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING SO MANY PEOPLE 
WHO ARE WITH THE NUT WHO ARE GOING 
ON STRIKE TODAY SAYING THAT THE 
FIGURES OF THIRTY THOUSAND AS AN AVERAGE 
WAGE THEY'RE SAYING THEY ARE NOT 
GETTING EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE TEN 
YEARS OF EXPERIENCE THEY ARE 
SAYING THAT IS NOT A FAIR QUOTE AND 
THEY ARE WONDERING WHERE THE 
TEACHERS ARE HE THEY ARE COMING

HAVE A PORTRAIT DONE SO WE'RE 
JUMPING ON THE BANDWAGON TOM 
COATES JOINS YOU US ARE YOU ON TO 
THE REAL THING NOW 
I'M PLAYING

OWE ON THIS SIDE 
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO WE WERE SAYING 
WHY CAN'T ENGLAND'S FOOTBALLERS 
TAKE PENALTIES LIKE CRISTIANO 
RONALDO CAN WE CHANGE THAT NOW HE HE MISSED ONE 
GOOD MORNING 
THEY ARE PROBABLY THE TWO MOST 
ENTERTAINING SIDES IN THE WORLD 
BUT MANCHESTER UNITED AND BARCELONA 
DREW NIL NIL MANCHESTER UNITED 
WILL BE THE HAPPIEST SIDE DESPITE 
MISSING THE PENALTY HERE IT IS IN 
THE THIRD MINUTE OF THE MATCH 
CRISTIANO RONALDO WAS THE CULPRIT 
OH DEAR AFTER THAT IT WAS ALL 
BARCELONA AS THEY TRIED TO 
ESTABLISH A LEAD AHEAD OF NEXT 
WEEK'S SECOND LEG 
THIERRY HENRY WAS ONE OF A NUMBER 
OF PLAYERS WHO MISSED GOOD CHANCES 
IT ENDED GOALLESS MANCHESTER 
UNITED HAVE THE HOME ADVANTAGE NEXT 
WEEK FOR THE SECOND LEG 
THE PLEASING THING FOR ME WAS THEY

CHANCES IN THE MATCH AND MAYBE I 
THINK AFTER HALF TIME THEY HIT THE 
SIDE NET AND ONE OTHER OCCASION 
THEY GOT TO THE BI LINE WHICH WAS 
CLEARED OTHER THAN THAT I THINK 
WE HAVE DONE WELL IN TERMS OF 
REDUCING THEIR OPPORTUNITIES 
RANGERS IN ACTION TONIGHT THEY

NOW THAT WE'RE HERE WE CAN SAY FOR 
THE FIRST TIME THAT WE CAN LOOK 
FORWARD TO TWO VERY TOUGH GAMES 
BUT ALSO THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING 
INTO A EUROPEAN FINAL WHICH FOR A 
COACH OR YOU KNOW OR A PLAYER IS 
A BIG THING IN CAREER 
KEN DOHERTY HAS BECOME THE THIRD 
FORMER CHAMPION TO LOSE IN THE 
FIRST ROUND OF THE SNOOKER

YOU HEARD OF ZERO CRICK BUT 
CRICKET LOOK AT THIS THIS WAS THE 
GOLF TOURNAMENT YESTERDAY IN IN 
OXFORDSHIRE SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT 
THE DIFFERENCE 
THE DIFFERENCE 
THE DIFFERENCE YOU MIGHT SPOT SOMETHING STRANGE 
NOW HAVE YOU GOT IT YET YES 
THERE ARE TWO FLAGS THIS IS POWER 
PLAY GOLF THEY SAY IT COULD CATCH 
ON IN EUROPE ACROSS THE WORLDMENT 
WHEN YOU PLAY GOLF FOR POINTS YOU 
GET ONE POINT 
FOR BOGEY AND THREE FOR A PAR AND THREE FOR A BIRDIE 
IF YOU SAY YOU GO FOR THE SKULL AND 
CROSS BONES HOLE THERE YOU DOUBLE 
YOUR POINTS IF YOU GET BIRDIE 
BECAUSE IT IS A HARDER HOLE 
YOU PLAY NINE HOLES IT IS FASTER 
GAME AND YOU INCREASE THE ELEMENT 
OF RISK 
THIS IS BEFORE YOU YOU TEE OFF 
YES YOU SAY YOU ARE GOING TO GO 
FOR T. 
THOSE AREN'T FAR APART 
THE BLACK ONE WAS IN THE CORNER AND 
THERE WAS BUNKER BEHIND IT OR IT 
MIGHT BE NEAR THE WATER 
THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF RISK AND 
THEY THINK IT MIGHT BE PLAYED 
INSTEAD OF PRO AM 
I'M JUST GIGGLING BECAUSE I'M NOT 
BAD AT MINI GOLF 
IF I GET THE HOLE WITHOUT LOSING MY 
BALL I CONSIDER THAT A SUCCESS 
SEE YOU IN A BIT 
TO A DISTURBING STORY THAT YOU 
HEARD EARLIER IN OUR NEWS BULLETIN 
ABOUT THE NUMBER OF VIOLENT ATTACKS 
ON BABIES AND CHILDREN IT HAS BEEN 
INCREASING AT AN ALARMING RATE 
THERE HAS BEEN STUDY OF ACCIDENT 
AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS IN 
ENGLAND AND WALES AND THE FIGURE 
HAS DOUBLED IN A YEAR VIOLENCE 
AGAINST PEOPLE OVERALL WENT DOWN 
PROFESSOR JONATHAN SHEPHERD LEADS 
CARDIFF UNIVERSITY'S VIOLENCE AND 
RESEARCH GROUP AND DAME MARY MARSH 
IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE 
CHILDREN'S CHARITY THE NSPCC 
NSPCC NSPCC IT DOES APPEAR TO BE ALARMING THE 
ASSAULT INJURY RATE FOR UNDER TENS 
MORE THAN DOUBLING IN YEAR THE THE OVERWHELMING MESSAGE FROM THIS 
RESEARCH AND THIS IS PART OF A A 
SCIENTIFIC SURVEY OF A AND AMP E. 
DEPARTMENTS IN ENGLAND AND WALES IS 
THAT VIOLENCE IS COMING DOWN IT 
COME ACROSS ALL AGE GROUPS 
FOR THE GENERAL POPULATION 
EIGHTEENS TO 
THIRTIES THOSE PEOPLE WE ARE WORRIED 
ABOUT IN TOWN AND CITY CENTRES FOR 
THOSE OVER OVER FIFTY IT HAS GONE DOWN 
THIS IS GOOD NEWS THIS THIS MEANS 
WE CAN FEEL SAFER AND WE SHOULD 
FEEL SAFER AND IT IS THIS IS 
REFLECTING THE SUCCESS OF BETTER 
POLICING AND COUNCILS AND PUBLIC 
HEALTH AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT WORKING 
TOGETHER TOGETHER THAT FIGURE FOR CHILDREN DOES 
APPEAR TO BE ALARMING DOESN'T IT 
YES THIS IS A CAUSE FOR CONCERN 
CERTAINLY IT IS THE FIRST TIME 
THAT WE HAVE NOTICED OR FOUND AN 
INCREASE IN THE UNDER TENS 
FROM WHAT TO TO WHAT 
THIS IS 
AROUND ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND MORE INJURIES 
INJURIES WE ESTIMATE YEAR ON YEAR 
BUT WE NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES WE DON'T KNOW 
WHETHER THIS IS FAMILY VIOLENCE OR 
WHETHER THIS IS BETWEEN CHILDREN 
OUTSIDE OF FAMILIES OR INDEED 
WHETHER THIS MAYBE CHILDREN BEING 
INJURED ON THE STREET OR AT THE 
HANDS OF OTHER CHILDREN 
WILL YOU TELL US PUT THAT TO MARY 
WHY DO YOU THINK THERE HAS BEEN AN 
INCREASE 
I AGREE THIS IS INCREASE DISTURBING AND TO HAPPEN SO 
SUDDENLY AFTER TWELVE YEARS OF 
SURVEYING A AND AMP E. DEPARTMENTS IT SEEMS 
UNFORTUNATELY LIKELY THAT A LOT OF 
THE INJURIES ARE VIOLENT ASSAULTS 
AT HOME BECAUSE THESE ARE INJURIES 
TO CHILDREN THAT ACCIDENT AND 
EMERGENCY HAVE DETERMINED AS A 
VIOLENT ASSAULT 
SO PARENTS SO PARENTS AND CARERS 
THIS MUST BE A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR 
IF IT WAS GOING TO BE VIOLENT 
ASSAULTS CHILD ON CHILD I WOULD 
HAVE EXPECTED TO SEE THAT IN THE 
TEENAGE GROUP BUT IN THAT GROUP 
VIOLENT ASSAULTS HAS GONE DOWN IT IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY INCREASE 
THAT IS RIGHT OFF THE SCALE COULD 
COULD IT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH 
THE WAY THINGS ARE REPORTED OR OR 
PEOPLE BEING MORE WILLING TO REPORT 
THINGS 
THIS SURVEY HAS BEEN GOING THINGS ON USING THE SAME METHOD FOR TWELVE 
YEARS NOW AND WE WORK WITH A 
SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SCIENTIFIC 
SAMPLE OF CASUALTIES AROUND THE 
COUNTRY AND IT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE 
POPULATIONS THAT THEY SERVE IT 
TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE MINOR INJURIES 
UNITS THAT CHILDREN ARE OFTEN 
TREATED IN NOW SO WE THINK THIS IS 
A REAL INCREASE AND I WOULD SAY 
THAT THIS REALLY DOES EMPHASISE THE 
IMPORTANCE OF PREVENTION AND 
IMPLEMENTING THINGS THAT WE KNOW 
THAT WORK FOR EXAMPLE NURSES 
WORKING WITH VULNERABLE FAMILIES 
THE SURE START SCHEMES FOR EXAMPLE 
HOW DO YOU KNOW FAMILIES ARE 
VULNERABLE I RECKON THERE ARE 
FEW FAMILIES WHERE THINGS ARE GOING 
ON BEHIND CLOSED DOORS THAT WE 
NEVER KNOW ABOUT UNTIL IT IS TOO 
LATE INTO THAT'S BEEN THE CONCERN 
AND WHAT WE HAVE CAMPAIGNED ABOUT 
TRYING TO GET PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
CONCERNS ABOUT A CHILD TO RAISE 
THEM WITH SOMEBODY TO PHONE AND 
LET US KNOW 
THE CRITICAL THING FOR ACCIDENT AND 
EMERGENCIES IS THAT THE STAFF 
WORKING THERE CAN IDENTIFY THAT AN 
INJURY THAT FOR A CHILD THEY ARE 
CLEAR AS TO WHETHER IT IS AN 
ACCIDENTAL INJURY OR NOT THAT'S 
DIFFICULT DIFFICULT IT MAYBE THAT WE HAVE GOT BETTER AT 
THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH 
CARDIFF UNIVERSITY FOR NUMBER OF 
YEARS NOW TO HELP HELP DEVELOP THE 
ADVICE TO PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND 
WHETHER BRUISE IS LIKELY TO BE AN 
ACCIDENT OR NOT WHETHER BURN 
COULD BE ACCIDENTAL OR NOT 
WHETHER FRACTURE IS ACCIDENTAL 
AND IT IS CRITICAL AND THE 
GOVERNMENT IS COLLECTING ATA ON 
THIS A AND AMP ES IN IN ENGLAND WILL HAVE 
TO RECORD WHETHER AN INJURY TO A 
CHILD IS DELIBERATE OR NOT 
WHAT'S SO STRANGE IS THE FIGURES 
FOR THE UNTEN UNDER TENS ARE 
VARIOUS COMPARED TO THE TO THE 
TREND YOU MENTIONED FOR OTHER AGE 
GROUPS IT IS IN THE OTHER 
DIRECTION 
THE OVERALL MESSAGE THAT DIRECTION VIOLENCE IS COMING DOWN WE KNOW 
THIS FROM OUR OWN STUDY OF INJURIES 
TREATED IN ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY 
DEPARTMENTS WE ARE GETTING THE 
SAME MESSAGE FROM POLICE TA POLICE 
DATA WE ARE GETTING THE SAME 
MESSAGE FROM THE BRITISH CRIME 
SURVEY IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT 
VIOLENCE IS COMING DOWN AND THAT'S 
A REAL PLUS AND SOMETHING TO BE 
BUILT UPON BUT THIS FINDING WITH 
REGARD TO YOUNG CHILDREN IS 
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD 
TAKE SERIOUSLY 
O. K. JOHN DAME MARY THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH INDEED PROFESSOR JOHN EVEN 
THE MAIN STORIES THIS MORNING THE 
FIRST NATIONAL TEACHERS' STRIKE FOR 
MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS GETS UNDER WAY 
TODAY AND EIGHT THOUSAND SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND 
AND WALES WILL BE AFFECTED 
TWO MEN ARE BEING QUESTIONED ON 
SUSPICION OF MURDERING JAMES HUGHES 
A SEVERELY DISABLED BOY WHOSE 
MOTHER WAS FOUND DEAD TWO DAYS AGO 
AND THE A PRENTISS WILL BE JOINING 
US ON THE SOFA LIVE LATER IN THE 
PROGRAMME WE DON'T REVEAL THEIR 
IDENTITY BECAUSE PEOPLE MAY HAVE 
RECORDED IT OR WUCHING IT ON I 
PLAYER WATCHING IT ON I PLAYER 
SO WE DON'T REVEAL WHO IS THE LOSER 
AT THE MOMENT 
HELLO MATH HELLO TODAY THE SUNSHINE WILL BE 
PUNCTUATED BY HEAVY SHOWERS PUSHED 
ALONG BY SOME PRETTY HEFTY BREEZES 
THERE IS FOG IN PARTS OF YORKSHIRE 
AS WELL BUT THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE 
LOW PRESSURE NEARBY YOU CAN SEE IT 
IN THE ATLANTIC IT'S A FAIRLY 
LARGE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE AND IT 
IS PUSHING ACROSS THIS NARROWBAND 
OF PRETTY INTENSE RAIN IT HAS 
BEEN THROUGH NORTHERN IRELAND AND 
THE SOUTH WEST AND PRETTY MUCH 
CLEARED HERE AND MOVING FURTHER 
EASTWARDS BUT IT IS MOVING PRETTY 
RAPIDLY AND THE SUNNIER SKIES WILL 
FOLLOW ON BEHIND ALL THE WAY TO THE 
EAST COAST BY THIS AFTERNOON 
HOWEVER THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF 
SHOWERS DEVELOPING CERTAINLY MORE 
THAN YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND SOME 
COULD BE HEAVY AND THUNDERY 
MORE CLOUD THAN SUNSHINE FOR 
SCOTLAND THIS AFTERNOON BUT IN THE 
BRIGHTER MOMENTS ACROSS EASTERN 
SCOTLAND TEMPERATURES COULD REACH 
FIFTEEN DEGREES AND A MIXTURE OF 
SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS FOR NORTHERN 
IRELAND BUT THE SHOWERS IN WALES 
AND THE SOUTH WEST SHOULD HAVE 
CLEARED AWAY BY SIX P. M. AND MOST PLIESS 
WILL BECOME DRY AND BRIGHT WITH 
TEMPERATURES INTO THE MID TEENS 
AND ANY SHOWERS THIS EVENING WILL 
CLEAR AWAY IN THE FIRST PART OF 
TONIGHT AND IT SHOULD BE DRY ACROSS 
MUCH OF THE COUNTRY A BIT OF FOG 
AND MIST HERE YA THERE BUT THEN 
HERE AND THERE BUT THEN MORE 
MOISTURE PUSHES IN FROM THE WEST SO 
ON FRIDAY SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN 
IRELAND START WET BUT THE REST OF 
THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE DRY 
IT WAS HOT YESTERDAY TIME TO START 
WEARING THE SUN CREAM AND THE 
SUNIES HOW IS THE WEATHER IN 
BELFAST DECLAN 
SURPRISINGLY IT IS 
SUNNY WHICH HAS TAKEN US BY 
SURPRISE 
I'M LOOKING OUT AT THE CRANES FROM 
HARLAND AND WOLFF IN BELFAST YOU 
CAN'T MISS THEM WHEN YOU COME HERE 
AND WHEN YOU USED TO TALK ABOUT THE 
ECONOMY IN NORTHERN IRELAND THAT 
IS WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF BECAUSE 
HARLAND AND WOLFF WAS A DOMINANT 
SHIPYARD THE YARD THAT BUILT THE 
TITANIC AND IT USED TO BE A MAIN 
STAY OF THE ECONOMY BUT THINGS 
HAVE CHANGED THE HOUSE OF FRASER 
HAS OPENED UP IN BELFAST FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN THE PAST COUPLE OF 
WEEKS BUT THE SIGNIFICANT THING 
ABOUT THIS BIG SHOPPING CENTRE HERE 
TODAY HAS ALL BEEN BUILT BY PRIVATE 
MONEY TEN YEARS AGO YOU WOULD NOT 
HAVE FOUND INVESTORS WILLING TO 
TAKE THAT RISK IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED 
DRAMATICALLY 
NEW DEVELOPMENTS AND DRAMATICALLY A FRESH CONFIDENCE BELFAST ONE 
REAPING THE BENEFITS OF PEACE 
THINGS HAVE REALLY CHANGED LESS 
THAN TEN YEARS AGO THIS WAS 
BELFAST AT THE HEIGHT OF THE 
TOURIST SEASON A CITY IN SHUTDOWN 
BECAUSE OF A ROW OVER ORANGE ORDER 
PARADES ITS POTENTIAL AS A HOLIDAY 
DESTINATION HAS BEEN REBORN 
TOURISTS ARE OF COURSE IMPORTANT 
TO THE ECONOMY BUT GETTING BIG 
FIRMS TO COME AND SET UP HERE ONE 
ESSENTIAL NORTHERN IRELAND IS 
STILL VERY SPEND DEPENDANT ON 
PUBLIC SERVICE JOBS AND GOVERNMENT 
MONEY HOWEVER THERE ARE SINS OF 
INVESTMENTS FOUR BIG COMPANIES 
HAVE ANNOUNCED INVESTMENTS HERE AND 
A CONFERENCE WILL BE HELD IN 
BELFAST NEXT MONTH ON INVESTMENTS 
SOME WAY HAVE THOUGHT TWICE ABOUT 
POURING MONEY INTO HERE IN THE PAST 
NOT ALL THE DIFFERENCES ARE 
POSITIVE TEXTILES MANUFACTURING 
AND OTHER TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES 
HAVE SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF 
CHEAPER OVERSEAS COMPETITION THE 
SHIP YARD'S FAMOUS CRANES ARE STILL 
HERE AND THEY ARE STILL WORKING 
BUT HARLAND AND WOLFF EMPLOYS ONLY 
A FRACTION OF THE WORKFORCE IT ONCE 
DID IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN 
A FOCUS ON DIFFERENT CRANES ALONG 
BELFAST'S SKYLINE THERE HAS BEEN A 
HUGE BOOM IN BUILDING FUELLED BY 
SOARING PROPERTY COSTS BUT THIS 
HAS SLOWED RECENTLY 
SO HOUSE PRICES HAVE RISEN SHARPLY 
AND THERE ARE MANY MORE JOBS AND 
PEOPLE HAVE A LOT MORE MONEY IN 
THEIR POCKETS ALAN BRIDLE IS AN 
ECONOMIST AT THE BANK OF IRELAND 
AND WE'LL TALK TO HIM IN A MOMENT 
BUT GARY SLATTERY YOU ARE THE 
MANAGER OF HOUSE OF FRASER AND 
YOU'RE HOPING FOR PEOPLE TO SPEND 
THEIR MONEY IN YOUR SHOP 
YES AT 
LONG LAST WE'RE HERE AND SINCE 
OPENING WE'VE BROKEN ALL RECORDS 
FOR THE COMPANY AND PEOPLE HAVE 
VOTED WITH THEIR WALTZ AND PURSES 
AND HOW MUCH ARE PEOPLE WILLING TO 
SPEND ARE THEY BIG SPENDERS HERE 
BIG SPENDERS ABSOLUTELY THE SIZE 
OF RETAILING IN BELFAST IS 
EQUIVALENT TO CARDIFF SHEFFIELD OR 
NEWCASTLE BUT THE HOUSE OF FRASER 
IN BELFAST IS TAKING SIMILAR 
AMOUNTS OF MONEY AS SOME OF THE BIG 
CITIES IN THE U. K. 
AND THE REASON 
THERE IS SO MUCH MONEY TO SPLASH 
AROUND IS BECAUSE WE RELY ON WELL 
PAID CIVIL SERVANT JOBS HERE ABOUT ABOUT A THIRD OF PEOPLE EMPLOYED ARE IN 
THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND THERE IS A 
STABILITY IN INCOME AND GROWTH AND 
MAYBE TWO IN EVERY THREE COMES FROM THE 
PUBLIC SECTOR 
BUT THAT CAN'T BE 
GOOD FOR THE GENERAL ECONOMY DOES 
IT NOT CROWD OUT PRIVATE 
INVESTMENT 
THERE IS A DOWNSIDE AND INVESTMENT THAT IS AN IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE 
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR AND THAT 
IS ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS HERE TO 
TRY TO REDRESS 
THAT IMBALANCE AND AND THAT IMBALANCE EXISTS BECAUSE THERE 
WERE THIRTY YEARS WHERE YOU DIDN'T HAVE 
PRIVATE COMPANIES INFESTING A LOT 
OF MONEY HERE FOR VERY OBVIOUS 
REASONS 
ABSOLUTELY IN THE DARK REASONS DAYS OF THE TROUBLES NORTHERN 
IRELAND LOST A LOT OF ITS INDUSTRY 
BASE AND THE TOURISM INDUSTRY AND 
THANKFULLY NOW THOSE THINGS ARE 
PICKING UP AGAIN 
THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH AND WE'RE HERE IN BELFAST 
BECAUSE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS FROM 
NOW THERE IS A BIG INVESTMENT 
CONFERENCE ON HOW TO GET MORE 
FOREIGN MONEY HERE THAT WILL BE 
ATTENDED BY SOME OF THE BIGGEST 
NAMES IN AMERICAN BUSINESS AND A 
LOT OF POLITICIANS ARE TURNING UP 
FOR THAT JAMBOREE AS WELL THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH 
LATER ON WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT ONE 
OF OUR MOST FLAMBOYANT CELEBRITIES

HE'S TAKING HIS STYLE TO AMERICA 
HE IS STARRING IN A FILM CALLED 
FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL

LET'S MOVE ON 
BACK TO OUR MAIN STORY THIS MORNING 
IT IS SOMETHING THAT MANY OF YOU 
ARE AFFECTED BY THE TEACHERS' 
STRIKE REACTION HAS BEEN MIXED BUT 
IT IS CLEAR THAT LOT OF BREAKFAST 
VIEWERS AREN'T IMPRESSED WE'LL PUT 
SOME OF YOUR POINTS TO THE ACTING 
HEAD OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF 
TEACHERS FIRST LET'S HEAR FROM 
THREE VIEWERS WHO GOT IN TOUCH 
WENDY WAS AT SCHOOL DURING THE LAST 
TEACHERS' STRIKE AND SHE BELIEVES 
HER EDUCATION SUFFERED AS A RESULT 
IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES DUE TO THE STRIKES 
ACTION I DO BELIEVE I SUFFERED AT 
ONE POINT UP TO WHAT IS NOW KNOWN 
AS YEAR NINE I WAS GETTING A AND B. 
GRADES BY THE POINT OF LEAVING 
SCHOOLS I DIDN'T REACH ANY AS OR B.'S 
AND NOWHERE DO ANY OF THE STUDENTS 
THAT THE POINT L. THINK THE TEACH 
INTERPRETS' STRIKE IS A GOOD IDEA 
BUT THE TIMING IS OFF THERE ARE 
LESS SIX SCHOOL DAYS UNTIL THE S. A. T.'S 
WEEK AND ME AND MY SCHOOLFRIENDS 
ARE MISSION OUR ENGLISH MATHS AND 
SCIENCE 
I AGREE WITH THE STRIKE SCIENCE BECAUSE TEACHERS DESERVE FAIR PAY 
FOR THE HARD WORK THEY PUT INTO 
MAKE US ABLE TO PASS OUR EXAMS ON 
THE OTHER HAND I DISAGREE WITH THE 
STRIKE BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO 
DISRUPT THE LEARNING OF A LEVEL 
STUDENTS AND OTHER STUDENTS 
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE EXAM PERIOD IS 
GETTING CLOSER 
THOSE WERE THE 
VIEWS OF STUDENTS WHO CONTACTED 
BREAKFAST YESTERDAY CHRISTINE 
BLOWER IS THE ACTING GENERAL SEXY 
OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS 
GOOD MORNING 
IT IS THE TIMING 
THAT'S GOT PEOPLE GOING ON THIS 
WE'VE GOT YEAR NINES JUST ABOUT TO 
DO THEIR S. A. T.'S YEAR ELEVENS ARE IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THEIR GCSES ALICE SAID 
THEY COULDN'T HAVE PICKED A WORSE 
TIME TO STRIKE JACK IS DOING HIS 
AS EXAMS HOW ARE WE STUDENTS MEANT 
TO FINISH OUR COURSES AND DO WELL 
IN THE EXAM THE TEACHERS AREN'T 
THERE IT REALLY IS SELFIC THE THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS LOOKED 
CAREFULLY AT THE TIMING OF THIS 
STRIKE WE ABSOLUTELY HAVEN'T HIT 
ANY EXAM DAYS THE OTHER THING IS 
THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE PROFESSIONALS 
WHO WILL HAVE BEEN WORKING 
EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE SURE WE 
PREPARE CHILDREN FOR THESE EXAMS 
YOU PICKED EXAM WEEKS MY SON IS 
DOING GCSES THIS WEEK THESE ARE 
WEEKS THEY CAN'T GO INTO SCHOOL AND 
THEY CAN'T BE TAUGHT BY TEACHER 
IT'S AT CRUCIAL TIME MY MY DAUGHTER IS ALSO DOING PUBLIC EXAMS 
AND THEY WILL HAVE BEEN DOING THESE 
COURSES FOR TWO YEARS IF WE 
WEREN'T TAKING ANY ACTION THERE 
MIGHT BE STUDENTS WITH NO TEACHER 
IN THIS PARTICULAR SUBJECTS NEXT 
YEAR SOCIETY REALLY IS VITAL FOR 
US TO TAKE THIS A AT A POINT WHEN 
WE'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS POINT TO 
GOVERNMENT 
RIGHT YOU SAY THEY GOVERNMENT HAVE TO TAKE THE ACTION NOW IN THE 
MIDST OF ALL THESE EXAMS OR THEY 
MIGHT NOT BE HERE NEXT YEAR OTHER 
UNIONS ARE THE NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL MAERSTS AND 
WOMEN TEACHERS CAME IN EARLIER AND 
SAID THEY ARE NOT STRIKING OTHER 
UNIONS AREN'T STRIKE BAUTS NOT 
ABOUT PAY THE AVERAGE PAY AT THE 
MOMENT IS THIRTY THREE MILLION THOUSAND 
LOTS OF 
TEACHERS THIRTY THREE THOUSAND 
SOME ARE PAID THIRTY THREE THOUSAND HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE A LOT OF 
THOSE ARE HEAD TEACHERS THERE ARE 
LOTS OF YOUNG TEACHER IN THIS 
LONDON ARE PAID WELL BLOE THAT 
THEY ARE HAVE TO GO PAY BACK THEIR 
STUDENT LOINS AT FORTY EIGHT PER CENT AND HAVING 
THEIR PAY INCREASE BY TWO E. N. FORTY FIVE PER CENT 
THERE ARE PROBLEM IN THIS GETTING 
TEACH INTERPRETS INTO CLASSROOM IN 
THIS LONDON AND OTHER PARTS OF THE 
COUNTRY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM 
WALES SAID WE NEED THE BRIGHTEST 
AND THE BEST GRADUATES BECAUSE 
TEACHING IS AN IMPORTANT JOB WE 
BELIEVE AND OUR MEMBERS BELIEVE WE 
NEED THIS PAY INCREASE NOT JUST 
FOR THEIR OWN PAY BUT SO WE CAN 
KEEP UP TEACHER RECRUITMENT YOU YOU ARE GETTING SUPPORT FROM VIEWERS 
WHO SAY YOU ARE DOING AN INCREDIBLE 
JOB THEY DON'T DOUBT THAT IT'S 
TIMING THEY ARE UNSURE ABOUT AN 
EMAIL ASKS WHAT MAKES TEACHERS 
THINK THEY ARE SO SPECIAL I'M A 
NURSE MY HUSBAND IS A SERVICEMAN 
AND WE HAVE HAD BELOW INFLATION PAY 
RISES WE DON'T HAVE THE OPTION OF 
STRIKING AND WE ARE PAID LESS THAN 
TEACHERS 
NURSES IF THEY ARE TEACHERS MEMBERS OF TRADE UNIONS THE OPTION 
TO DO THAT 
PERHAPS THEY DON'T WANT 
TO PUT THE HEALTH OF THEIR PATIENTS 
AT RISK 
YOU HAVE AN ETHICAL AND 
MORAL PART OF YOUR JOB AS WELL 
DON'T NEW PART OF THAT ETHICAL AND 
MORAL SIDE IS WE NEED TO DEFEND 
PUBLIC SERVICES IS SO WE ARE ON 
STRIKE WITH OTHER PUBLIC SECTOR 
WORKERS WE NEED PROPERLY STAFFED 
PUBLIC SERVICES TEACHING THE 
NURSING 
WHAT MANDATE DO YOU THINK NURSING HUH TO STRIKE ONLY A THIRD OF YOUR 
UNION VOTED TWO THIRDS OF THE 
UNION COULDN'T BE BOTHER TO DO VOTE 
ON THIS AS AN ISSUE IS IT REALLY 
AN ISSUE AMONG YOUR MEMBERS 
IT IS 
WORKLOAD IS AN ISSUE THERE ARE 
LOTS OF ISSUES FOR TEACHERS PAY IS 
THE UNIFYING ISSUE EVERYBODY'S 
AFFECTED BY PAY L. WOULD SAY THAT 
IF YOU LOOK AT TURNOUTS IN ALL 
SORTS OF BALLOTS IN GENERAL 
ELECTIONS LOCAL ELECTION ALSO 
PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY VOTE IN 
LARGE NUMBERS BUT IN TWO THOUSAND TWO WHEN WE 
HAD ACTION IN LONDON BECAUSE WE 
PARTICULARLY NEED TO DO INCREASE 
LONDON PAY FOR TEACHERS WE HAD 
MORE TEACHERS JOINING THE ACTION 
THAN HAD VOTED OVER A PERIOD OF 
TIME THEY REALISED THAT THE UNION 
WAS MAKING THE RIGHTS CALL WHAT I 
CAN SAY IS THERE WILL BE CHILDREN 
WHO ARE NOT IN SCHOOL TODAY THE 
DISRUPTION ISN'T AS MASSIVE AS IT 
WHAT BE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TEACHERS 
COMING INTO THE PROFESSION 
CAN YOU 
PUT YOUR HAND ON YOUR HEART AND SAY 
THAT YOU THINK CHILDREN'S EDUCATION 
AND EXAMS WOULDN'T BE AFFECTED BY 
THIS ACTION 
CLEARLY CHILDREN WHO 
ARE NOT IN SCHOOL TODAY WILL BE TO 
SOME EXTENT AFFECTED BUT THE 
MEMBERS OF ALL TEACH INTERPRETS 
UNIONS WORK HARD TO MAKE SURE THE 
CHILDREN GET THE BEST DEAL THAT 
THEY CAN CHRISTINE THANK YOU

IN PLACES WITH RAIN IN WALES AND 
SCOTLAND THE FURTHER SOUTH YOU ARE 
THE DRIER IT WILL BE AND THE 
BRIGHTNESS WILL HOLD ON ACROSS THE 
SOUTH EAST 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S GO TO 
BELFAST WHERE THE SUN IS SHINING 
AND JOIN DECLAN HELLO AGAIN I 
HAVE BEEN IN BELFAST ALL MORNING 
TALKING TO YOU ABOUT HOW THE 
ECONOMY IN THIS PLACE HAS BEEN 
TRANSFORMED IN A SHORT PERIOD OF 
TIME WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT BELFAST 
THAT BUILDING OVER THERE IS 
PROBABLY THE ONE THAT MANY OF YOU 
THINK OF IT'S A LOCAL POLICE 
STATION STILL HEAVILY FORTIFIED 
BUT TIMES HAVE CHANGED WE ARE 
SEEING A LOT OF BELFAST 
REDISCOVERING ITS PAST THERE IS A 
LT OF OLD VICTORIAN BUILDINGS DOWN 
THERE TOWARDS THE ALBERT CLOCK 
THEY ARE THE BUILDINGS THAT REMIND 
YOU OF BELFAST WHEN IT WAS A 
WEALTHY CITY IN THE TIME OF EMPIRE 
FROM SHIP BUILDING AND TEXTILES A 
LOT OF THOSE BUILDINGS ARE BEING 
RESTORED FOR USE IN THE PRESENT DAY 
THERE IS LOT OF VICTORIAN YA AROUND 
IN BELFAST REMEMBERING THAT 
ECONOMIC PAST INCLUDING THIS 
LOVELY THING HERE WHICH IS THE 
JAFFY FOUNTAIN BY HAS BEEN 
RELOCATED BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL HOME 
AND RESTORED THE REASON IT'S HERE 
IS TO SHOW YOU WHAT IS THEN BEHIND 
IT WHICH IS VICTORIA SQUARE IT'S 
A BIG SHOPPING CENTRE BUT NOT JUST 
ANY ONE IT'S THE LARGEST 
COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT THAT 
NORTHERN IRELAND HAS EVER SEEN 
UNLIKE PREVIOUS PROJECTS IT'S BEEN 
FUNDED FROM PRIVATE MONEY THAT HAS 
BEEN THE BIG CHANGE IN THE ECONOMY 
THE BUSINESS CLIMATE IS DIFFERENT 
INVESTORS ARE WILLING TO COME IN 
AND TAKE A RISK AND INVEST IN BIG 
PROJECTS LIKE THIS IT'S MEANT MORE 
JOBS MUCH MORE WEALTH AROUND AND 
BIG JUMPS IN HOUSE PRICES AS WELL 
IT'S ALL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
BECAUSE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP TWENTY 
THIRTY YEARS AGO THAT WAS THE TYPE OF 
PROJECT YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE 
THOUGHT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED 
BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN 
THE RISK OR PUT THEIR MONEY WHERE 
THEIR MOUTHS ARE 
A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE THAN IT WAS 
GORDON BROWN FACE HIS FIRST 
ELECTION AS PRIME MINISTER NEXT 
WEEK OF COURSE NOT A GENERAL 
ELECTION BUT WHEN ALL WELSH 
COUNCILS AND MANY ENGLISH ONES ARE 
GOING TO THE POLLS ARE MOTORISTS 
GETTING SCRAP UP BY PETROL PRICE OR 
THE SCRAPPING OF THE TEN PENCE BAND 
OR ARE THEY MORE CONCERNED ABOUT 
RUBBISH JOCOBURN IS IN NORTH 
LONDON TODAY 
GOOD MORNING TO YOU YOU ARE RIGHT 
ALMOST ALL THE TRUCKS HAVE LEFT THE 
DEPOT NOW THAT IS JUST AS THE 
DEBATE OVER HOW OUR WASTE IS 
COLLECTED COULD BE ONE OF THE 
CRUNCH ISSUES AT NEXT MONTH'S LOCAL 
ELECTIONS I WENT TO THE MIDLAND TO 
A TOWN FAMOUS FOR WORCESTER WOMEN 
TO FIND OUT WHAT WILL COUNT THERE 
ON POLLING DAY NEXT WEEK 
WE MAY BE IN THE MYFUL A GLOBAL 
CREDIT CRUNCH BUT HERE IN MIDDLE 
OF A GLOBAL CEFRBLG BUT HERE IN 
AUTHENTIC MIDDLE ENGLAND IT'S THE 
DEBATE WHICH HAS DIVIDED THE TOWN 
THE WEEKLY RITUAL OF COLLECTING THE 
RUBBISH WAS SCRAPPED HERE THREE 
YEARS AGO TO FORTNIGHTLY 
COLLECTION MUCH OF THE WORK OF 
LOCAL COUNCILS PASSES MOTORIST BY 
UNNOTICED EXPECT IN THE CASE OF 
THE HUMBLE DUSTBIN THAT IS AN 
ISSUE WHICH TRULY MATTERS AND 
GALVANISES THE PUBLIC ON THE 
DOORSTEP SANDRA LIVES IN A 
TERRACED HOUSE WHICH LITTLE ROOM 
FOR THE TWO LARGE WHEELIE WINS THE 
LOCAL ELECTIONS WILL BE HER CHANCE 
TO VOTE AGAINST THE SCHEME SHE SAYS 
IS A HEALTH HAZARD 
IT'S CERTAINLY 
UNSANITARY IT SMELLS IN WARM 
WEATHER THE ODOUR IS UNPLEASANT L. 
HAVE SEEN RATS TWICE AND THAT IS 
BECAUSE OF THE FORTNIGHTLY BIN 
COLLECTIONS 
THIS IS WHERE LABOUR COLLECTIONS MAY PICK UP VOTE CAMPAIGNING FOR 
WEEKLY COLLECTIONS OF FOOD WASTE TO 
BE BROUGHT BACK BUT THEY HAVE A 
TOUGH JOB ON THEIR HANDS THEY LOST 
CONTROL OF THE COUNCIL IN TWO THOUSAND 
DESPITE HOLDING ON TO THE 
PARLIAMENTARY SEAT THE PARTY'S 
HEADY DAYS OF NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WHEN THIS 
MIDLAND TOWN SWUNG TOWARDS TONY 
BLAIR AND NEW LABOUR HAVE SINCE 
DRIFTED AWAY SO THE VOWS OF 
WORCESTER WOMEN COULD WELL BE UP 
FOR GRABS VOTES 
THEY STILL EXIST THEY ARE TEN TO 
ELEVEN YEARS WISER WHETHER OR NOT THEY 
ARE AS ENAMORED WITH LABOUR ONLY 
TIME WILL TELL 
THE GOVERNMENT'S 
CURRENT DIFFICULTIES COULD HELP 
TORY TACTICS ON THE DOORSTEP 
THEY ARE IN CHARGE BUT ONLY WITH A 
MINORITY ADMINISTRATION DESPITE 
SOME POLITICAL FALL OUT OVER THE 
BIN ISSUE THE PARTY IS STICKING TO 
FORTNIGHTLY COLLECTIONS SOME 
SHOPPERS AGREE 
IF YOU RECYCLE IT PROPERLY THERE 
IS NO PROBLEM WITH THIS TALK OF 
BINS OVERFLOWING AND RATS AND ALL 
OF THAT RUBBISH 
RECYCLING IS GOOD 
AND IT DOES MAKE YOU AWARE OF HOW 
MUCH YOU ARE THROWING AWAY AND IT'S 
EASY TO CUT IT DOWN 
WHILE LABOUR 
AND THE TORIES HOLD ENTRENCHED 
POSITIONS IN THIS DEBATE THE 
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE WORKING 
TOWARDS A COMPROMISE THE THRUST OF 
THEIR CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT LOCAL 
FUNDING AND HOW THE TOWN'S MONEY IS 
BEING SPENT IN THE END IT WILL 
COME DOWN TO WHETHER THE ELECTIONS 
ARE A VERDICT ON WHO REINS AT THE 
TOWN HALL OR AT WESTMINSTER 
WELL AS THE PARTIES BATTLE IT OUT 
IN THE FINAL DAYS OF CAMPAIGNING 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES ACROSS ENGLAND 
AND WALES WILL BE PRAYING FOR

ELECTION LAST AUTUMN HE SAID 
PRICES WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO UP TO 
FUND PROJECTS LIKE CROSSRAIL IN 
FACT HE HAD AGREED TRANSPORT FOR

BE CHANGED SOME TFL OFFICIALS 
BELIEVE WITHOUT THE RISES THERE

INTENDS TO DO

THERE IS A REALLY POINT ARE GOOD 
POINT WHEN YOU ARE DIETING THIS 
DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE 
DIETING YOU ARE OBSESSED BY FOOD 
YOU THINK ABOUT FOOD AND YOU WANT 
TO EAT FOOD ALL THE TIME THERE IS 
A PSYCHOLOGICAL PART TO DIETING 
THE HEALTH EXPERTS SAY ALL YOU HAVE 
GOT TO DO IS EAT LESS AND MOVE MORE 
AND NONE OF US DO IT 
THIS IS ABOUT THE HAVES AND THE 
HAVE NOTS ONCE YOU HAVE THOUGHT 
ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE HAD IN YOUR 
MEAL YOU REALISE YOU HAVE HAD A 
LOT IF YOU ARE IN DENIAL YOU ARE 
THINKING I HAVE NOT HAD ANYTHING 
YOU GET MORE HUNGRY 
FEMALE STUDENTS AT BIRMINGHAM 
UNIVERSITY WERE INVITED TO MUNCH ON 
BISCUITS ONE GROUP GROUP ASKED TO 
WRITE ABOUT THEIR LAST MEAL THE 
OTHER GROUP TO OUTLINE THEIR 
JOURNEY TO THE CAMPUS AND THE 
JURIES GROUP ATE FEWER BISCUITS 
THAN THE LAST GROUP 
IF YOU ARE LAST MEAL WAS ORANGE AND 
A LETTUCE LEAVE YOU HAVEN'T GOT A 
LOT TO WRITE ABOUT 
THAT'S RIGHT BILL 
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE OBESITY 
PROBLEM WE NEED TO START PUTTING 
TOGETHER WHAT PACKAGES WORK FOR 
PEOPLE PEOPLE NEITHER OF YOU LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE 
HAD A PROBLEM WITH WEIGHT 
I HAVE HAD AS YOU KNOW 
IN MY TWENTIES MY WEIGHT WENT UP AND 
DOWN DOWN NOT NOW NOT NOW I HAVE ACCEPTED I 
CANNOT EAT THE ENTIRE TRAY OF MARS 
BAR ICE CREAMS AND STILL FIT INTO 
MY DRESSES 
IS IT THAT YOU DON'T GO FOR ONE IF 
YOU GET THE TASTE FOR ONE THAT'S 
IT 
IT IS HAVING SOMETHING ELSE TO IT DO FOR ME HAVING CHILDREN MEANT I 
HAD SOMEBODY ELSE TO FOCUS ON BUT 
ME AND THAT'S HELPFUL 
IT MEANS THERE IS SNACKS 
THERE IS 
HALF A FISH FICK FINGER LEFT AND AM 
I GOING TO EAT THAT AND ON THE 
WHOLE NO I DON'T BECAUSE I HAVE 
BEEN FAT AND PERSONALLY I WOULD 
RATHER NOT BE 
SOMETIMES THE CHOICES CAN BE TOUGH 
BUT YOU HAVE A CHOICE AND SOMEONE 
WHO IS WATCHING THINKS I HAVE BEEN 
STRUGGLING AND IF YOU MAKE THAT 
CHOICE AND USE THIS RESEARCH AND 
THINK I WILL THINK ABOUT THE 
BREA KFAST I HAD SO I AM NOT GOING 
TO SNACK AT ELEVEN HUNDRED A M. 
YOU KNOW WHAT WORKED FOR ME IN 
RESTAURANTS THE WAITER OR WAITRESS 
COMES AROUND AND TELLS YOU WHAT IS 
THERE FOR DESERT AND I GET THEM TO 
GO THROUGH THE LIST AND VISUALISE 
EACH ONE AND BY THE TIME THEY HAVE 
FINISHED I AM NOT HUNGRY 
YOU HAVE 
GOOD SELF CONTROL BECAUSE SOME 
MIGHT SAY CAN I HAVE A BIT OF 
WHY DO THE MARKS AND AMP SPENCER ADS WORK 
WHERE THEY HAVE THE SLOW MOTION OF 
THE CHOCOLATE PUDDING BECAUSE WE 
ACTUALLY VISUALISE FOOD AND IT 
MAKE US WANT TO EAT IT DOESN'T IT 
THIS IS ABOUT CONCENTRATING ON WHAT 
YOU HAVE HAD THE ADS SAY WHAT YOU 
MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE IT IS THE 
HAVES AND HAVE NOTS YOU HAVEN'T 
HAD THE THINGS IN THE ADS AND YOU 
ARE DYING TO GO OUT AND GET IT 
A ROGUE THEORY POINTED OUT TO ME 
LAST WEEK WHEN WE WERE IN HOTEL 
HAVING STARTERS AND MAIN COURSES 
AND THE SWEET TABLES WHERE YOU GO 
AND SAY I WILL HAVE BIT OF THIS AND THAT AND THEY SAID SOME PEOPLE 
WERE HAVING THE PUDDINGS FIRST 
BECAUSE IF THEY HAD THE PUDDINGS 
FIRST THEY WOULD FEEL LESS HUNGRY 
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO DO THAT DO 
REGULARLY BECAUSE YOU WOULD BE 
HAVING A DIET DIET BASED ON 
PUDDINGS PUDDINGS YOU HAVE THE SALAD AND THE 
CHOCOLATE BISCUIT AND NOT THE OTHER 
POINTS I WOULD SAY 
ALL THIS TALKING ABOUT FOOD IS NOT 
DOING ME ANY ANY FAVOURS AT ALL 
YOU HAVE ALREADY HAD YOUR 
CROISSANT CROISSANT NOW THE WEATHER CROISSANT 
IT IS A LOVELY START WHILE THERE 
WILL BE SUNSHINE IN BETWEEN LIFTING 
THE TEMPERATURES IT WILL BE 
TOUCH COOLER THANKS TO MORE OF A 
BREEZE BREEZE THAT BREEZE COMING IN FROM SOUTH 
OR SOUTH WESTERLY DIRECTION THE 
REASON WE HAVE GOT SHOWERS IN THE 
FORECAST TODAY WE HAVE AN AREA OF 
LOW PRESSURE THE CENTRE MAYBE TO 
THEIC NORTH AT BUT IT IS LARGE 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE ENOUGH ENOUGH 
TO THROW THE THE SHOWER CLOUDS IN 
IT IS CLEAR THROUGH NORTHERN 
IRELAND IT IS CLEAR THROUGH WALES 
AND THE SOUTH WEST NOW AND PUSHING 
THROUGH THE BULK OF ENGLAND SEN 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN SCOTLAND 
THERE WILL BE HEAVY BURSTS IN THE 
NEXT HOUR OR TWO IT WILL CAUSE A 
LOT OF SURFACE WATER AND SPRAY ON 
THE ROADS BUT BECAUSE OF THE 
BREEZE IT WILL CLEAR THROUGH THE 
COUNTRY QUICKLY THE SKIES WILL 
BRIGHTEN BUT UNLIKE YESTERDAY 
WHERE IT GOT DRY AFTER THE RAIN 
THERE WILL BE SHOWERSMENT SOME OF 
THE SHOWERS WILL BE HEAVY AND 
THUNDERY PUSHED ALONG BY THE WIND 
ONCE THEY ARE WITH YOU THEY WILL 
DISAPPEAR QUICKLY AND HOPE 
HOPEFULLY SOME BRIGHTNESS WILL FALL 
IN BEHIND THE TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
YO YOING IN AND OUT OF THE SHOWERS 
STILL A FEW SHOWERS ACROSS NORTHERN 
IRELAND JUST A LITTLE BIT OF 
BRIGHTNESS IN BETWEEN 
NOW ACROSS WALES AND THE SOUTH WEST 
WE HAVE GOT THE HEAVIEST OF THE 
SHOWERS DURING THIS MORNING AGAIN 
SOME OF THOSE WITH HAIL AND THUNDER 
BUT BY FOUR MPL FEWER IN THE WAY OF 
SHOWERS AND MORE IN THE WAY OF 
BRIGHT WEATHER WITH LOTS OF 
SUNSHINE SUNSHINE DURING THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT 
THE SHOWERS WILL FADE AWAY MOST OF 
US 
WILL HAVE DRY NIGHT 
AND THERE WILL BE A LITTLE BIT OF PATCHY MIST AND FOG BUT TEMPERATURES HOLDING 
UP NICELY AROUND FOUR TO SIX CELSIUS 
EIGHT OR NINE CELSIUS IN THE WEST 
IT IS IN THE WEST LATER ON WE START 
TO DRAG IN MOIST AND AND HUMID AIR 
MOST OF US GET OFF TO DRY START 
A BRIGHT START BUT CLOUD WILL 
BUILD AND WE WILL SEE RAIN PUSHING 
TOWARDS NORTHERN IRELAND AND 
WESTERN SCOTLAND LATER 
TEMPERATURES AT BEST SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN CELSIUS

CHAN BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK 
HE'S IN AMERICA WHAT IS GOING

YES WHEN I WAS FIRST ASKED ON IF I WANTED TO GO TO AMERICA I 
THOUGHT NO I DON'T THINK SO IT 
SOUNDS DANGEROUS BUT WHEN I WENT 
THERE AND MET THE DIRECTORS AND 
WENT TO THE AUDITION AND THEY SAID 
THIS PERSON CAN'T PRETEND TO BE 
ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT HE IS SO 
THEY RE WROTE THE PART AND GIVE IT 
TO ME AND I WENT TO HAWAII THE 
TEDIOUS BEAUTY OF HAWAII IT IS 
LIKE BEING BEATEN ABOUT BY THE HEAD 
WITH A RAINBOW CAN YOU GET THAT 
OUT OF MY LEG PLEASE 
YOU SOUND 
LIKE YOU'RE FROM LONDON YES HAVE YES HAVE WE LOST YOU TO L. A. 
NO I'M AN 
ENGLISHMAN I BELONG TO HER MAJESTY 
AND THE CROWN AND ALBANY AND I 
HAVE A HOUSE AND A CAT AND I DON'T 
THINK THE CAT WOULD LIKE IT IN L. A. 
PLEASE US 
THIS IS WALKARD 
IT IS NOW AND US AND I BELIEVE A BIOPIC THE STORY OF 
YOUR LIFE IS IN THE WORKS 
WHY ARE 
YOU SO INTENSE ARE YOU LIKE THAT 
WHEN YOU ARE AT HOME THE DINNER 
IS IN THE WORKS I AM MAKING A 
FILM WITH MICHAEL WINTERBOTTOM 
ABOUT MY LIFE STORY BASED ON MY 
BOOK MY BOOKIE WOOK THE NUMBER 
ONE BEST SELLING AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF 
THE YEAR 
I DON'T KNOW WHEN WE'RE DOING IT 
HOPEFULLY QUITE SOON L. THINK I'M 
PLAYING MYSELF A PART ONE IMAGINE 
I'LL STILL MANAGE TO BOTCH 
ONE OF 
THE MOST SURPRISING STORIES THIS 
WEEK IS JOHN PRESCOTT HAVING 
BULIMIA 
YES JOHN PRESCOTT HAVING 
BULIMIA BULIMIA I WAS BULIMIC AND THAT'S 
PROBABLY WHY YOU ASKED ME THE 
QUESTION AND I'M ALLOWED TO LAUGH 
A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE HE WAS 
DRINKING CONDENSED MILK LET'S 
CONDENSE THIS MILK NO IT IS A 
SERIOUS CONDITION AND THERE ARE 
SUPPORT GROUPS AND EVERYONE MUST GO 
FOR HELP BUT JOHN PRESCOTT I WISH 
I COULD HAVE KNOWN AT THE TIME I 
COULD HAVE HELPED 
HE'S LAUGHING AND THEN NOT WE'VE 
BEEN TOLD HIS HAIR IS AN EXTENSION 
OF HIS PERSONALITY 
OH IS IT THE THE FILM OPENS TOMORROW ONCE RESERVED 
FOR THE LIKES OF ROYALTY 
POLITICIANS AND THE VERY VERY 
WEALTHY NOW MORE NORMAL PEOPLE 
ARE COMMISSIONING PORTRAITS SO WE 
DECIDED TO SEE WHAT THE FUSS WAS 
ALL ABOUT AND ALL MORNING WE HAVE 
BEEN HAVING OUR PORTRAIT PAINTED 
TOM COATES HAS BEEN WORKING AWAY 
ALL MORNING AND STELLA VINE JOINS 
US LET'S LOOK AT IT NOW TOM 
THERE IT IS AND THAT CONTROVERSIAL 
ARM 
IT IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU ARM HAVE SO MUCH DARE I SAY CLUTTER 
BEHIND YOU BUT I WAS MORE 
INTERESTED TO DO A QUICK SKETCH TO 
FIND THE COLOUR AND TONE AND THEN 
GO FOR THE COMPOSITION IT IS SO 
IMPORTANT FOR THE SUBJECT 
YOU HAVE 
GOT THE CHARACTERS VERY WELL 
BECAUSE SHAUN IS WORKING VERY HARD 
AND I'M STARING INTO SPACE AND 
CHRIS IS MUSCLING IN ON THE PICTURE 
SO YOU HAVE CAUGHT US ALL VERY WELL 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT TEN 
STELLA HAVE YOU NOTICED MORE 
PEOPLE WANTING PORTRAITS PAINTED OF 
THEMSELVES 
YES LOTS OF PEOPLE ASK THEMSELVES FOR COMMISSIONS OF THEMSELVES OR 
THEIR CHILDREN BUT I ON THE WHOLE 
TRY TO PAINT SOMETHING I CAN 
CONNECT WITH SO WE COME TO A 
MEETING POINT OF CHOOSING SOMEBODY 
THEY'RE MORE FASCINATED BY AND I AM 
TOO BUT OCCASIONALLY WHEN IT 
COMES TO A COMMISSION I DO FIND IT 
FASCINATING I'M NOT SURE 
FASCINATING WINEHOUSE WOULD HAVE COMMISSIONED 
THAT WOULD SHE 
IT IS A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT WE SEE 
IN THE NEWSPAPERS EVERY MORNING 
THAT WAS GUY CALLED JOHN WHO 
WANTED A PAINTING OF AMY L. MADE 
ABOUT TWENTY PAINTINGS OF HER AND THIS 
IS ONE I WAS REALLY HAPPY WITH 
IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE EXPRESSION 
OF LIFE TRY TO STEP INTO THE 
SHOES OF SOMEONE ELSE AND YOU 
SOMEHOW PUT A BIT OF YOUR OWN LIFE 
IN AND BRING IT TO LIFE 
WHAT IS 
THE AMY YOU HAVE CAPTURED THERE 
WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO GET TO I I DON'T KNOW THERE WAS SOMETHING 
ABOUT THE IMAGE I FOUND REVEALING 
IT IS HARD TO PUT IT INTO WORDS 
BUT THERE IS A VULNERABILITY BUT 
ALSO A DRIVE AND I THINK 
TOM I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU WHAT 
THE POINT IS OF HAVING PORTRAIT 
BE CAREFUL WITH IT AM 
I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU TOM WHAT 
THE POINT OF HAVING YOUR PICTURE 
PAINTED WAS BUT IT IS A KIND OF 
ATTITUDE ISN'T IT 
IT IS 
INTERESTING BECAUSE PEOPLE COME TO 
YOU TO ASK AND THEY'RE EMBARRASSED 
THEY WANT A COMMISSION BUT THEY 
SAY IT'S FOR MY WIFE THEY TEND 
TO PUT IT ON TO SOMEBODY ELSE AND 
THEY ROUGHLY KNOW THE PRICES AND 
THEY SAY CAN YOU DO SOMETHING 
THAT WILL FLATTER ME I REMEMBER 
A FEW YEARS AGO I DID A FULL 
LENGTH PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN AND SHE 
KEPT INTERRUPTING AND SAYING 
COULD YOU MAKE IT MORE FLATTERING 
AND DROP THAT SHOULDER AND GET RID 
OF THAT PATCH ON MY FACE AND I 
ENDED UP DOING WHAT SHE WANTED AND 
I HAD GOT IT NINETY NINE PER CENT FINISHED AND I 
WALKED AWAY FROM IT AND THAT IS A 
CLASSIC ATTITUDE OF ARTISTS 
AND WE 
HAVE THIS ONE OF JOSE MOURINHO 
WOULD HE HAVE APPROVED OF THIS 
PICTURE 
I THINK IT IS QUITE PICTURE HANDSOME IT HAS ENDED UP BEING 
QUITE A PRETTY PAINTING I THINK 
AND I THINK THEIR COLOURINGS ARE 
SIMILAR BUT I MADE A CONNECTION 
WITH THE STORY BECAUSE MY SON AND I 
HAD AN EXPERIENCE WITH THE 
QUARANTINE BUSINESS WE HAD AN 
ELDERLY CAT AND WE WERE GOING TO 
SPAIN AND IT WAS QUITE DISSTRETING 
SO I LEAPT AT THAT TSH DISTRESSING 
SO I LEAPT AT THAT STORY AND 
IDENTIFIED WITH IT 
HAVE YOU 
IDENTIFIED WITH US 
NO I QUITE 
LIKE THAT ONE L. LIKE THE DOG 
BECAUSE IT REMINDS ME OF MY DOG L. 
DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE HAVE GOT 
HAVE YOU FINISHED ON OUR PORTRAIT 
NO 
WE'LL LET YOU IT IF GET BACK TO NO IT IN JUST A SECOND THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH AND STELLA THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH L. WANT HIM TO TALK ABOUT 
HIS DOG WE'LL HAVE TO TALK ABOUT 
IT AFTERWARDS 
SORRY WE HAVE TO PUSH ON SELLING 
ICE CREAM SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD 
ESPECIALLY NOW THE WEATHER IS 
GETTING SLIGHTLY BETTER BUT FOR 
ONE TEAM ON THE APPRENTICE THE 
CHANCE FOR VICTORY MELTED AWAY 
LINDI MNGAZA PROPOSITION TO SELL 
ICE CREAM TO COMPANIES THAT ALREADY 
MADE THEIR OWN WAS KIND OF THROWN 
OUT BY SIR ALAN LET'S LOOK AT LAST 
NIGHT'S SHOW 
LUCINDA RISK A MANAGER HAVE YOU 
ASSESSED YOUR RISK YET WHAT IS THE 
RISK OF YOU GETTING FIRED THE THE PROBABILITY IS ONE IN THREE OH OH THAT IS GREAT THAT WAS BRILLIANT 
WHAT A BRAIN STORM THAT WAS DO I 
NEED RISK ASSESSMENT MANAGERS I'VE 
NEVER NEEDED ONE THE WHOLE OF MY 
LIFE I TAKE RISKS JENNIFER THE 
EXCLUSIVITY THING THE THING YOU 
TOOK ON YOUR OWN BACK IS 
UNFORGIVABLE I'M NOT SURE WHETHER 
YOU GET ON WITH PEOPLE L. DO KNOW 
YOU'VE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS VERY GOOD 
AT SALES BUT I'M LOOKING FOR 
SOMEONE WHO HAS A FEW MORE SKILLS 
THAN SALES ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY LINDI YOU WERE SECOND IN COMMAND 
SECOND IN COMMAND FOR WHAT I THINK 
WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS 
TASK IDENTIFYING THE CUSTOMERS AND 
THE SELLING OF THE MERCHANDISE AND 
IT IS SALES YOU LOST THIS TASK ON 
AND 
THAT BRINGS ME TO CONCLUSION THAT LINDI YOU'RE FIRED 
OH YOU DIDN'T EXPECT THAT DID 
YOU 
I DIDN'T AT ALL 
NICE TO SEE YOU YOU NICE TO SEE YOU GUYS THAN YOU YOU FOR HAVING ME 
WHO DID YOU 
THINK WAS GOING TO GO IN YOUR HEART 
OF HEARTS 
I HONESTLY THOUGHT IT 
WOULD BE ANYBODY BUT ME L. WAS 
SITTING THERE THINKING I'M FINE 
ONE OF THESE GUYS IS NOT GOING BACK 
TO THE HOUSE HAD I SERIOUSLY 
THOUGHT I WAS IN THE FIRING LINE I 
WOULD HAVE ARGUED MY CASE A LOT 
BETTER 
I WAS SHOCKED THAT ANY OF BETTER YOUR TEAM WERE IN THE DOORING BOARD 
BECAUSE I THINK YOUR TEAM HABLGDZED 
THE WHOLE THING A LOT BETTER THAN 
THE OTHER TEAM THAT JUST HAD A 
LAST DITCH PUNT 
YES WE WERE 
OVERCONFIDENT WE WERE LIKE A WELL 
OILED MACHINE THROUGH THE WHOLE 
PROGRAMME AND THOUGHT WE HAD IT IN 
THE BAG AND THEN SADLY WE DIDN'T 
IT WAS THE EXCLUSIVE DEALS 
I KNOW 
ACTUALLY IT WAS TWO THINGS A 
COUPLE OF THE APPOINTMENTS 
I KNOW 
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY 
WERE WITH 
ICE CREAM MAKERS 
I KNOW AND I 
TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT AND WE DID 
GIVE THOSE APPOINTMENTS TO THE 
WEAKER SIDE OF THE TEAM HAD WE 
GONE TO THEM WE WOULD HAVE SOLD 
COALS TO NEWCASTLE 
HI GUYS WE'VE GOT OUR FIRST ORDER 
FOR 
FIFTEEN LITRES 
THAT'S BRILLIANT FOR A COUPLE OF THINGS I'D LIKE TO 
CHECK WITH YOU A COUPLE OUR 
APPOINTMENTS HAVE NO NEED FOR ICE 
CREAM HAVE THEIR OWN ICE CREAM 
MAKER 
YOU KNOW WHAT EVEN IF THEY MAKER HAVE YOU CAN STILL SELL TO THEM 
YES BUT IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO 
TAKE IT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE 
IT SO WE NEED TO KNOW THAT FIRST 
AND FOREMOST 
ARE YOU WORRIED NO NO I'M NOT I JUST FIND IT ANNOYING 
WHEN PEOPLE TELL YOU HOW TO DO 
THINGS YOU KNOW HOW TO DO OH OH YOU'RE A GREAT TEAM AND WORKED 
REALLY WELL TOGETHER BUT YOU GET 
THE GIRLS IN THE BOARDROOM AND OH 
YOU TURN ON EACH OTHER IT IS 
DREADFUL 
I KNOW 
YOU AND JENNY DREADFUL WERE GREAT TOGETHER AND WORKED 
REALLY WELL AS THE TEAM AND THE TWO 
OF YOU WERE IN THE BOARDROOM AND 
IT IS A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE ALL 
COMPETING FOR THE ONE JOB AND YOU 
CONSTANTLY HAVE THAT IN YOUR MIND 
AND BEFORE THE BOARDROOM YOU'RE THE 
BEST OF FRIENDS DON'T WORRY YOU 
WERE AMAZING AND YOU WERE 
EXCELLENT AND THEN IN THE 
BOARDROOM YOU REALISE YOU HAVE NO 
MORE FRIENDS YOU'RE LITERALLY ON 
YOUR OWN AND FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL 
AND IT IS A REALLY AWFUL SITUATION 
AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO HAVE A 
DECENT RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEBODY 
IN THE HOUSE BECAUSE IN THE 
BOARDROOM YOU ARE LITERALLY AT 
EACH OTHER'S THROATS 
LET'S LOOK AT 
YOU SCRAPPING 
LINDI WAS MADE 
SECOND IN COMMAND SHE WAS THERE ON 
ALL MY PHONE CALLS AND APPOINTMENTS 
AND I DID SAY TO YOU WHEN YOU HAD 
TO CANCEL THE MEETING WITH THE 
OTHER CINEMA THAT WE MADE A MISTAKE 
MAKING THAT EXCLUSIVITY DEAL SO SO WHY DID YOU AGREE WITH THE 
EXCLUSIVITY WITH THE BUYER BECAUSE BECAUSE WE ALL AGREED AND YOU DIDN'T 
CONSULT ANYBODY 
OH DEAR LOOK AT LUCINDA'S FACE AS 
WELL THERE SHE IS IMMACULATELY 
DRESSED HOW ONE WOMAN HAS SO MANY 
SUITS IN THAT TINY CASE I HAVE NO 
IDEA 
I DON'T KNOW IT WAS LIKE A IDEA MAGIC CASE WITH BRIGHTLY COLOURED 
CLOTHING AND HATSZ 
AND EVEN 
LUCINDA HATS AND EVEN US LUCINDA 
SHE SEEMS NICE AND CALM BUT EVEN 
IN THE BOARDROOM SHE GOT NASTY YES YES IT IS THE NATURE OF THE SHOW WITH 
PEOPLE WHO ARE EXTREMELY DRIVEN AND 
FIREY CHARACTERS AND WE CAN ALL BE 
CALM AND COOL BUT ONCE IN THE 
BOARDROOM AND THAT FIRE COMES OUT 
OF EVERYBODY 
YOU CLAIM TO BE ONE 
OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL 
ENTREPRENEURS OF BRITAIN 
I THINK 
I'M UP THERE WITH THE BIG BOYS HOW HOW DO BE QUANTIFY THAT 
WITH THE 
PEOPLE AROUND ME L. GENERALLY 
SOCIALISE WITH PEOPLE A LOT OLDER 
HOW OLD ARE YOU 
TWENTY TWO THE YOUNGEST 
CANDIDATE EVER 
WHAT SURPRISES ME IS THE LACK OF 
HUMILITY I'M THE GREATEST 
MY MOTHER ALWAYS TOLD ME AIM AS 
HIGH AS YOU CAN AND IF YOU FALL 
LOWER THAT'S O. K. AT LEAST YOU 
TRIED TRIED IS THERE NO SELF DOUBT AT ALL THE THE EXPERIENCE 
WAS HUMBLING FOR ME L. WAS CONVINCED I WOULD WAS GOING TO WIN WIN EVERY WEEK I THOUGHT I'M NOT GOING 
TO IN THE BOARDROOM I'M NOT 
PACKING MY CASE I WILL BE FINE I I WONDER IF LOOKING BACK WHAT THE 
HIGH POINTS AND LOW POINTS MIGHT BE 
BECAUSE WE HAVE SOMETHING IN MIND 
DO YOU REMEMBER THE LAUNDRY

LOOK AT THIS 
IT WAS MY IDEA L. SAID THAT WE 
SHOULD EVERY LOAD THAT WE WOULD 
TAKE BACK WE SHOULD GET EXTRA 
FINANCE FINANCE I DIDN'T SEND YOU OUT TO GET TIPS

MYSELF AND 
JENNIFER WHOEVER DECIDED TO DO 
THEIR LAUNDRY BE THEIR PERSONAL 
ACCOUNT MANAGER U. 
WHAT THEY WOULD QUERY SOMEONE

HOW IS ME PANTS DOING 
WE THOUGHT 
IT WAS AN ADVANTAGE THE BOYS 
WOULDN'T HAVE 
I DON'T KNOW OF ANYONE PROGRESSING 
THEIR LAUNDRY IT IS THE LAST THING 
I WOULD THINK THEY WANT TO DO YOU 
HAVE TAKEN IT AWAY AND I'M GOING TO 
PHONE THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR HOT LINE TO SEE 
THE PROGRESS ON MY MY CALVIN KLINES 
YOU HAVE GOT TO THINK WE WERE 
WORKING IN A TEAM WITH SIX OR SEVEN 
EXPERIENCED BUSINESS PEOPLE WE 
BRAIN BRAIN STORMED FOR AN HOUR I

FOR THE MAYOR SAYS IT IS HIS LEGAL 
RESPONSIBILITY TO SET FARES 
AROUND SIXTY SIXTY PER CENT OF THE CAPITAL'S 
SCHOOLS WILL BE AFFECTED BY TODAY'S 
STRIKE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL 
UNION OF TEACHERS ARE WALKING OUT 
OVER PAY THE UNION SAYS IT IS AN 
ISSUE RELEVANT TO TEACHERS IN 
LONDON WHO FACE A HIGHER COST OF 
LIVING LIVING THE FUNERAL OF GLORIA TAYLOR THE 
MOTHER OF DAMILOLA TAYLOR WILL TAKE 
PLACE TODAY MRS. TAYLOR SUFFERED A 
HEART ATTACK WHILST OUT WALKING 
WITH HER HUSBAND DAMILOLA WAS TEN 
WHEN HE WAS STABBED IN PECKHAM 
ON TO THE TRAVEL NEWS NOW A SIGNAL 
FAILURE AT MOORGATE MEANS THE 
METROPOLITAN LINE IS SUSPENDED THERE ARE DELAYS FROM DEBT FORD 
IT 
WILL BE A CLOUDY DAY IT WILL BRIGHTEN UP THAT'S IT 
WELCOME BACK 
THE WRITER POLLY CITIZENAM WAS JUST 
NINETEEN WHEN THAT FACE OPENED LAST YEAR 
NOW THE DRAMA WHICH IS A FAMILY 
DRAMA HAS BEEN REVIVED IN LONDON'S 
WEST END 
LINDSEY DUNCAN LEADS THE CAST 
LINDSEY IS HERE NOW 
GOSH THAT SOUNDS CHEERFUL 
BLEAK BUT FAN TAST I CAN 
IT WAS WRITTEN BY A NINETEEN YEAR OLD 
YES SHE WAS NINETEEN SHE IS NOW JUST TWENTY ONE 
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL A 
DAZZLING DEBUT I THINK 
AND WRITTEN FROM TEENAGER'S 
PROSPECTIVE IS IT 
WELL THERE ARE 
THREE WELL FOUR TEENAGERS IN IT 
ONE NON SPEAKING AND OBVIOUSLY THAT 
IS THE TERRITORY THAT POLLY 
RECENTLY LIVED I SUPPOSE BUT SHE 
IS ABSOLUTELY TO HER CORE A WRITER 
YOU JUST KNOW THAT WHEN YOU PICK UP 
THE PLAY L. NEVER HEARD OF POLLY 
WHEN I PICKED UP THE PLAY 
DID YOU KNOW SHE WAS SO YOUNG NO NO I JUST READ READ AND IT IS TOTALLY 
AUTHENTIC AUTHENTIC WHAT'S IT ABOUT 
IT IS ABOUT A 
FAMILY WHO HAS FALLEN APART AND ANY 
NORMALITY HAS DISAPPEARED BUT ONE 
OF THE THINGS IN TERMS OF HER AS A 
WRITER THAT I'M IMPRESSED BY THAT 
SHE CAN WRITE BEYOND HER YEARS THE 
CHARACTER I PLAY IS TO PUT IT 
CRUDELY A FANTASTIC PART AND THAT'S 
QUITE RARE IN SUCH A YOUNG WRITER 
TO BE ABLE TO WRITE OUTSIDE THEIR 
EXPERIENCE WITH SUCH AUTHENTICITY 
IT IS A VERY THERE IS NO POINT IN 
DENYING THAT IT IS A PAINFUL PLAY 
BUT IT IS A VERY THEATRICAL PLAY 
WHICH IS AGAIN I THINK A SIGN OF 
HER ENORMOUS SKILL AS A WRITER IN IN THE PLAY TWO OF THE YOUNGER 
CHARACTERS HAVE ACCESS TO DRUGS AND 
ALCOHOL FROM YOU FROM THEIR MOTHER 
IS THAT RIGHT 
YEAH MARTHA WHO IS 
NAMED AS A SORT OF HOMAGE BY POLLY 
AFTER MARTHA IN WHO IS AFRAID OF 
VIRGINIA WOLF WHICH GIVES YOU AN 
INDICATION OF WHERE SHE IS SHE IS 
AN ADDICT ALCOHOL AND PILLS AND 
SHE IS ADDICTED AS WELL TO HER SON 
AS A SORT OF EMOTIONAL CRUTCH SO SO 
SHE HAS ALMOST NO RELATIONSHIP WITH 
HER DAUGHTER WHO IS PLAYED BY 
HANNAH MURRAY FROM SKINS WHICH WILL 
PULL IN A LOT OF TEENAGERS 
YOU WILL HAVE A LOT OF TEENAGERS IN 
THE AUDIENCE 
DO YOU LIKE DOING I OFTEN ASK 
ACTORS THIS THEY SAY IT IS 
DIFFERENT WORKING ON STAGE THAN ON 
TELEVISION 
IT IS SO DIFFERENT L. TELEVISION THINK I WILL ALWAYS DO THEATRE IT 
IS REALLY WHERE I STARTED AND 
BECAUSE I LOVE WORKING WITH WRITERS 
I LIKE THE RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU 
HAVE WITH WRITERS AT THE MOMENT 
POLLY IS IN THE REHEARSAL ROOM ALL 
THE TIME MOSTLY WRITING THE 
SCREENPLAY OF THIS AND EDITING AND 
THAT BUT SHE IS ALWAYS THERE AND I 
LIKE THAT 
YOU HAVE SIXTEEN YEAR OLD SON 
I I DO DO I AM NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU HAVE 
PLIED HIM WITH BOOZE BUT YOU HAVE 
MUST OF DRAWN ON THAT RELATIONSHIP 
ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF PLAYING 
MARTHA COMPARED TO HER I LOOK LIKE 
THE DREAM MOTHER 
I THINK I'VE COME OUT OF IT REALLY 
WELL WELL HE CAME TO SEE IT AND I SUPPOSE IT 
IS THE ONLY TIME I FELT A LITTLE 
BIT OF TREPIDATION YOU KNOW HE IS 
A VERY MATURE KIND OF GUY BUT IT 
IS NOT I THOUGHT IT MAY NOT BE 
EASY TO WATCH YOUR OWN MOTHER 
PLAYING SOMEONE IN A DYSFUNCTIONAL 
RELATIONSHIP WITH HER SON AND SHE 
IS A VERY DAMAGED WOMAN SHE HAS 
SOME QUALITIES SHE IS CHARISMATIC 
IN SOME WAYS OTHERWISE YOU 
WOULDN'T WANT TO WATCH IT BUT HE 
WAS VERY TAKEN BY IT AND IN FACT HE 
IS ORGANISING A BIG GROUP OF 
FRIENDS TO COME AND SEE IT SO IT 
WILL BE A BLOCK BOOKING OF 
TEENAGERS ONE NIGHT 
WE NEED TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING 
YOU ARE GOING ON TO DO BECAUSE YOU 
ARE GOING TO BE PLAYING LADY 
THATCHER SOON 
APPARENTLY I AM 
IT IS COMING AS SURPRISE I'M I'M DAUNTED I THINK IT IS PROBABLY THE 
FIRST TIME YOU ARE ALWAYS DAUNTED 
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES 
ABOUT WHETHER YOU WILL YOU WILL 
SUCCEED IN A PIECE OF WORK BUT SHE 
IS ICONIC 
THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH DO YOU DO 
THE INNER THATCHER AND HOW MUCH DO 
YOU DO AN IMPRESSION 
AND WE HAVE 
ALL SEEN SPITTING IMAGE AND THE 
FEAR IS TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD TOO 
FAR BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING 
PRESENTATIONAL ABOUT MARGARET 
THATCHER SO I WILL BE WORKING ON 
THAT DURING THE DAY WHILE I AM 
PERFORMING THAT FACE AT NIGHT AND I 
HOPE MARGARET THATCHER DOESN'T 
APPEAR ON STAGE AT SOME POINT 
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN 
TIME FOR THE WEATHER WITH MATT 
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN TIME FOR THE WEATHER WITH MATT 
TIME FOR THE WEATHER WITH MATT HELLO THERE SIAN
