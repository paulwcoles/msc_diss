FUTURE 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS FUTURE EDWARD EDWARD I UNDERSTAND HIS SADNESS AND GRIEF 
ABOUT HIS SON IF MY CHILD WAS 
KILLED I WOULD GRIEVE FOR THE REST 
OF MY LIFE HOWEVER I THINK IT IS 
THE RIGHT VERDICT DON'T THINK IN REALITY IT SHOULD EVER HAVE BEEN 
BROUGHT IN 
THE FIRST PLACE I CAN 
UNDERSTAND WHY 
IT WAS 
BUT I THINK 
IT WAS THE RIGHT VERDICT PEOPLE PEOPLE HAVE THIS APPETITE FOR A CONSPIRACY 
THEORY I 
HAVE LIVED 
IN AMERICA A THEORY LOT AS YOU KNOW AND THEY STILL 
THERE IS STILL A VAST NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE THAT BELIEF THAT KENNEDY WAS 
KILLED BY THE C. I. A. THAT IS THE 
THEORY THAT GOES ON FOREVER WE WE WILL BE EXAMINING CONSPIRACY 
THEORIES LATER ON IN THE WEEK IF 
YOU ARE THERE THEORY ON IT E. MAIL 
US TWENTY YEARS IS AN AWFUL LONG TIME 
IN ANYONE'S LIFE BUT IT WAS AN AGE 
TO A MAN WHO SPENT ALMOST 
EVERY DAY 
OF THAT TIME 
UNDER THREAT 
OF 
EXECUTION KENNY RICHEY WAS FINALLY 
RELEASED IN JANUARY AFTER TWO 
DECADES ON 
DEATH ROW FOR AN ARSON 
ATTACK THAT 
LEFT THE GIRL DEAD IN 
OHIO 
BUT HE 
DID NOT DO IT HOW ON 
EARTH 
IS THE 
MAN COMING TO TERMS 
WITH 
WHAT HE 
HAS BEEN THROUGH AS 
JUSTIN THE SECOND DISCOVERED HE ISN'T NOT NOT MANY PEOPLE CAN LOOK DEATH IN THE 
FACE AND LIVED TO TELL THE TALE 
BUT THIS MAN CAN IT HAS BEEN THREE 
MONTHS SINCE KENNY RETURNED TO HIS 
HOME HERE IN EDINBURGH BUT HIS TIME 
IN SCOTLAND HAS PROVED AT LEAST AS 
DIFFICULT AS ALL OF THOSE YEARS 
BANGED UP IN THE U. S. PRISON CELL 
YOU CAME VERY CLOSE TO BEING 
EXECUTED DIDN'T YOU HE WERE 
NARROW WAY TECHNICALLY YES IT 
TECHNICALLY YES IT WAS EITHER A LETHAL INJECTION OR 
THE ELECTRIC CHAIR 
THE A ASKED YOU 
THIS WHAT DID YOU SAY A I SAID 
NEITHER 
IT WAS DEPRESSING HAD NEITHER NOTHING TO SHOW FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS OF MY 
LIFE AND 
THE WORLD HAD LEFT ME 
BEHIND 
DO YOU FEEL FREE NOW I BEHIND NOW I STILL FEEL IN PRISON INSIDE IT'S 
LIKE CAN STILL IN PRISON 
KENNY MOVED TO THE UNITED STATES IN 
NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO BUT FOLLOWING A SPELL IN THE 
MARINES HOUSE FIRE WOULD SEE HIM 
CHARGED WITH THE MURDER OF TWO 
YEAR OLD CYNTHIA COLLINS LOSING 
BOTH HIS FREEDOM AND IDENTITY HE 
BECAME PRISONER NINETEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR ON DEATH ROW 
YOU MANAGED TO SMUGGLE THINGS OUT 
OF PRISON DIDN'T YOU A I HAVE GOT 
MY UNIFORM HERE THIS IS A SPECIAL 
UNIFORM ISN'T IT 
THIS IS THE 
DEATH STRIPE THEY AUTOMATICALLY 
KNEW YOU WERE A DEATH ROW PRISONER 
WERE WAS THAT IMPORTANT BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY ARE A GREATER SECURITY RISK 
BUT KENNY WAS AN INNOCENT MAN A 
B. B. C. INVESTIGATION EXPOSED CRUCIAL 
FLAWS AND THE PROSECUTION CASE 
I'LL NOT ABOUT TO ADMIT TO 
SOMETHING I DIDN'T DO NOT FOR 
ANYTHING THERE IS ALWAYS A PART OF 
ME THAT DIES AND GIVES UP HOPE 
THERE IS A PART OF ME THAT SAYS 
YOU KNOW BRING IT ON JUST KILL ME 
NOW 
AFTER TWENTY ONE YEARS IN PRISON NOW KENNY WAS EVENTUALLY CLEARED OF 
MURDER MISCARRIAGES OF JUSTICE 
HAVE SEEN THE LIKES OF ANGELA 
CANNINGS DOM ANTONY AND PADDY 
HILL FREED ON APPEAL PADDY WAS ONE 
OF THE BIRMINGHAM SIX WRONGFULLY 
CONVICTED OF AN I. R. A. BOMB ATTACK IN 
NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR 
WHEN YOU ARE IN PRISON AND NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR ALL YOU'RE DOING IS FIGHTING TO 
PROVE YOUR INNOCENCE THAT IS AS 
FAR AS YOU HAVE THOUGHT YOU DON'T 
THINK ABOUT OUTSIDE AND YOU COME 
OUT 
AND FIND 
OUT WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD 
OF TIME 
THAT WE ARE NOT 
EQUIPPED IN 
ANY WAY WE ARE ALL 
BADLY DAMAGED 
KENNY HAS 
FOUND LIFE 
BADLY DAMAGED ON THE OUTSIDE 
JUST AS 
DIFFICULT I 
I AM VERY LONELY L. DON'T HAVE ANY 
FRIENDS I BASICALLY CONTEMPLATE 
SUICIDE A LOT MORE THESE DAYS THAN 
I DID BEFORE SERIOUSLY 
YES WHY SERIOUSLY YES WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO COMMIT 
BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO PUT AN END 
TO THE PAIN 
THE PAIN OF LIVING 
YES TODAY I HAVE TAKEN KENNY TO YES SEE PADDY HILL THEY LAST SPOKE TEN 
YEARS AGO WHEN KENNY WERE STILL ON 
DEATH ROW PADDY NOW DEDICATE HIS 
LIFE TO HELPING THE VICTIMS OF 
MISCARRIAGES OF JUSTICE HE IS 
HOPING TO ESTABLISH A RETREAT AND 
HAS GOT SOME ADVICE 
ONE OF THE 
BEST THINGS FOR OARS IS SHARING THE 
EXPERIENCE BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE CAN 
UNDERSTAND US WE ARE ALL ON THE 
SAME LEVEL MORE OR LESS EVEN 
THOUGH YOU MAY BE A FEW ONE THOUSAND MILES 
AWAY ONE POXY PRISON CELL AS THE 
SAME AS ANOTHER YOU SEE THE FIRST 
THREE OR 
FOUR YEARS 
I WAS OUT IF I 
HAD A 
MILLION POUNDS IN MY 
HAND I 
WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO 
YOU JUST 
PUT 
ME BACK IN 
MY CELL 
HE WANTED TO GO BACK YOU BET 
ANY MISCARRIAGE OF 
BACK JUSTICE 
VICTIM WHO 
COMES OUT AND 
TELL 
YOU THEY 
DON'T ARE A LIAR DO 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YES BECAUSE I 
YES BECAUSE I FEEL THE SAME WAY 
YOU THINK YOU 
WANT TO GO BACK 
YOU FEEL THAT WAY 
YOU DON'T WANT TO 
BUT YOU 
FEEL THAT 
WAY CAN YOU 
PUT KENNY 
WAY WITH SOMEONE 
WHO CAN 
HELP YES 
YES THAT IS 
WHAT I 
WANT HIM TO DO 
ARE TRYING TO GET A 
RETREAT SET UP 
WHERE WE CAN MEET UP 
AND SIT 
DOWN 
THAT WILL BE NICE GET PROPER 
COUNSELLING FROM PEOPLE WHO KNOW 
WHAT THEY'RE DOING 
WHAT YOU HOPE 
TO HAPPEN 
I HOPE TO GET A LIFE 
FIND A LITTLE BIT OF HAPPINESS 
THAT IS PROBABLY ALL I CAN FIND IF 
I CAN FIND ANY JUSTIN YOU CANNOT 
JUSTIN YOU CANNOT HELP BUT FEEL CONCERNED ABOUT HIS 
WELFARE 
IT WAS A REALLY DIFFICULT WELFARE SITUATION IN PRISON HE HAD 
SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR FIGHTING TO 
PROVE HIS INNOCENCE AND NOW HE IS 
BEREFT OF MEANING IT IS A REAL 
PROBLEM IF YOU ARE GUILTY AND 
RELEASED THERE 
IS A 
WHOLE 
PROCEDURE FOR RELEASING YOU BACK TO 
ACCLIMATISE YOU 
TO FREEDOM 
IF YOU 
ARE INNOCENT AS 
SOON AS 
THE 
VERDICT IS OVERTURNED YOU ARE OUT 
THERE IS VERY LITTLE SUPPORT SO IT 
IS A TOUGH 
SITUATION KENNY 
UNDERSTAND HE IS IN A DIFFICULT 
SITUATION AND 
WANTS TO WORK WANT 
CONTINUITY AND ONE'S RELATIONSHIPS 
HE EXPLAINED THAT HE IS VERY LONELY 
AND ONCE RELATIONSHIPS SO HIS HEART 
IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE 
IN THE FILMS I SUPPOSE HE WOULD 
COME OUT OF PRISON HAVE A 
DIFFICULT TIME HAVE AN EPIPHANY 
MEET THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE AND LIVE 
HAPPILY EVER AFTER BUT IT DOESN'T 
WORK LIKE THAT DOES IT NO BUT 
NO BUT THIS IS VERY AKIN TO THE LACK OF 
HELP GIVEN TO SOLDIERS IN 
AFGHANISTAN OR IRAQ WHO COME BACK 
WHEN THEY ARE DEAD THEY ARE BURIED 
FINE WHEN THEY COME BACK INJURED 
THERE IS VERY LITTLE HELP GIVEN TO 
THEM YOU CANNOT COMPARE PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE BEEN IMPRISONED AND OUR 
SOLDIERS FIGHTING I AM COMPARING 
THE ATTITUDE THE ATTITUDE TO THE 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH 
UNBELIEVABLE TRAUMA AND PAIN LIKE 
THESE TWO GUYS IMPRISONMENT 
INTERESTING THE LAST TIME JUSTINE 
WAS IN SCOTLAND WAS COVERING THAT 
EXACT STORY YES AND AGAIN POST 
TRAUMATIC STRESS BECAUSE TWENTY YEARS 
ISN'T IN PRISON IS AN INCREDIBLE 
TRAUMA 
LET'S HOPE PADDY HILL CAN TRAUMA GET HIM SOME HELP FIFTY YEARS AGO 
DURING THE COLD WAR CORSHAM IN 
WILTSHIRE HAD A SECRET BENEATH THE 
TOWN LIES A HUGE BUNKER IN THE 
EVENT OF A NUCLEAR ATTACK THIS IS 
WHERE THE PRIME MINISTER AND 
CABINET WOULD HAVE BEEN 
MOVED TO 
NONE OF US OF COURSE JUST THEM 
TRY AND STAY CHEERFUL AT HOME WE 
HAVE HAD THE DEATH OF DIANA LIFE 
IN PRISON AND A NUCLEAR ATTACK DAN 
SNOW GOT INTO THE BUNKER TO HAVE 
THE KNOWS ABOUT FOR THE ONE SHOW 
CORSHAM IN WILTSHIRE 
HAS 
YOU 
EXPECT OF 
AN ENGLISH TOWN A 
POST OFFICE A BAKERY AND PLENTY 
OF PLACES TO READ YOU MIGHT THINK 
IT IS PRETTY NORMAL AND IT IS 
EXCEPT IT HAS ONE THING THAT MOST 
TOWNS DON'T THE VAST HIDDEN SECRET 
CITY WITH 
ALL THESE SAME AMENITIES 
BUT BURIED UNDERGROUND THAT IS BECAUSE FIFTY YEARS AGO THIS PLACE 
AT THE FRONT 
LINE OF THE COLD WAR 
THE WORLD LIVED IN FEAR OF NUCLEAR 
ATTACK AS THE SOVIET UNION AND 
AMERICA AND HER ALLIES STOCKPILED 
ATOMIC WEAPONS SO REAL WAS THE 
THREAT THAT IN BRITAIN THE 
GOVERNMENT MADE A SERIES OF 
COMMERCIALS ADVISING WHAT TO DO IN 
THE EVENT OF A NUCLEAR STRIKE 
I AM 
GOING TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THE SYSTEM 
OF WARNING SIGNALS THAT WILL BE 
USED IN 
THIS COUNTRY 
IN THE EVENT 
OF 
A NUCLEAR 
ATTACK WHILE THE 
WHILE THE PUBLIC 
WERE BEING 
ADVISED TO BUILD 
SHELTERS 
IN THEIR 
LIVING ROOMS THE 
GOVERNMENT 
WOULD HAVE 
BEEN HEADING 
FOR SOMETHING 
MORE SUBSTANTIAL 
FOR SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL THEY WOULD BE ON 
THEIR WAY 
TO A 
SERIES OF 
UNDERGROUND BUNKERS 
BUILT 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
TO HOUSE 
THE 
GOVERNMENT SO THEY 
COULD LAUNCH 
THE 
FIGHTBACK THE BIGGEST 
AND MOST 
IMPORTANT WAS UNDER MY FEET HERE IN 
CORSHAM ORIGINALLY A QUARRY IN 
NINETEEN FIFTY SIX THIS PLACE WAS CONVERTED TO 
PROTECT THE PRIME MINISTER THE 
CABINET AND FOUR THOUSAND CIVIL SERVANTS 
IT EXIST AND WAS TOP SECRET UNTIL 
RECENTLY BUT TODAY THE MOD HAS 
GIVEN ME SPECIAL PERMISSION TO 
EXPLORE IT YOU REALLY FEEL LIKE 
YOU ARE IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH 
DOWN HERE ANDY QUINN WHO LOOKS 
AFTER THIS BUNKER IS GOING TO SHOW 
ME AROUND

COMMUNICATIONS CENTRE

BROWN PAPER NEVER BEEN USED REAL 
WHOLE FACILITY HAS NEVER BEEN 
EXERCISED

SOUND INSULATE HIS STUDIO YES YES THEY HAD TO GET THE MESSAGE TO THE

HAD BEEN 
USED FOR 
REAL 
HOW TERRIFYING 
IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN THE BUNKER HAS EVERYTHING TO 
KEEP ITS INHABITANTS ALIVE FOR NINETY 
DAYS FROM BASIC ACCOMMODATION TO 
HOSPITAL AND TOOK HUGE KITCHENS 
INDUSTRIAL SIZED 
IT IS MASSIVE INDUSTRIAL SIZED NEVER BEEN TOUCHED CAN YOU IMAGINE 
LIVING DOWN HERE 
I THINK IT WOULD 
BE VERY AUSTERE 
THEY WOULD BE SO 
WORRIED ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES 
BECAUSE THEY WOULD HARDLY BE ABLE 
TO SAY GOODBYE COMING DOWN HERE 
FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS THIS PLACE STOOD 
WAITING FOR THE WORST TO HAPPEN ON 
TO IT WAS FINALLY DECOMMISSIONED IN 
NINETEEN NINETY ONE I HAVE SPENT AGES WALKING 
AROUND THIS ALADDIN'S CAVE THIS 
STORE ROOM IT IS FULL OF 
STATIONERY GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS 
TOP SECRET BITS OF PAPER 
EVERYTHING THE GOVERNMENT WOULD 
NEED TO START REBUILDING THE 
COUNTRY AFTER A DISASTROUS NUCLEAR 
STRIKE IT IS ONE OF THE MOST 
EVOCATIVE PLACES I HAVE EVER IT IS A 
MONUMENT TO 
THAT TIME IN 
HISTORY WHEN 
WE ALL LIVED WITH THE 
SHADOW OF NUCLEAR WAR 
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN FEARFUL OF 
NUCLEAR WAR AT THAT TIME 
NOT A 
NUCLEAR WAR REALLY BECAUSE I WAS 
ABOARD A DURING THE GREAT WALL WE 
WERE BOMBED THREE TIMES AND I 
REMEMBER I WAS INJURED MY MOTHER 
AND FATHER WERE INJURED AND WE 
WENT THROUGH UNBELIEVABLE RAIDS L. 
COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO BE 
FRIGHTENED AS AN OLDER PERSON OF 
SOMETHING TINY NUCLEAR WAR I 
WOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
REAL WAR YOU KNEW A LOT ABOUT IT 
NINETY DAYS DOWN THERE THERE IT'S NOT 
THE BEST CHURCHILL HAD A PLACE AS 
BIG AS 
THAT STILL THERE 
UNDERGROUND WHEN THE GERMANS 
INVADED AS

THEY 
WOULD THE 
BRITISH UNDERGROUND HAD 
ALREADY DUG CHAMBERS ALL OVER THE 
COUNTRY

LOOK IN YOUR EYE I WOULDN'T CROSS

THAT RIGHT YES YES I DID CALCULATIONS IF YOU GET UP 
AT EIGHT HUNDRED A M. AND GO TO BED AT MIDNIGHT 
THAT'S NINE HUNDRED SIXTY MINUTES YOU WERE 
SMOKING ONE CIGARETTE EVERY NINE 
AND A HALF MINUTES 
PROBABLY EVERY 
FIVE AND A HALF MINUTES BECAUSE I 
WOULD GET UP AT SIX HUNDRED A M. AND I WOULD 
GO TO BED I WOULD GET THROUGH MORE 
THAN ONE HUNDRED THEY WEREN'T ALL SMOKED 
TO THE END BUT NEVERTHELESS I DID 
THAT'S WHY I'M COUGHING 
YOU PAID THE PRICE WITH YOUR HEALTH 
YOU SURVIVED THREE HEART ATTACKS 
IT IS NOT NICE BUT THERE YOU ARE 
I SURVIVED L. AM A SURVIVOR 
LET'S PLAY A GAME OF SPOT THE 
DIFFERENCE DIFFERENCE THIS IS KEIRA KNIGHTLEY 
BUT YOU WILL NOTICE HER BOSS BOSOMS 
THEY EXIST IN THE RIGHT HAND 
PICTURE PICTURE WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY 
HER BUST 
THE POINT IS SHE WAS AIRBRUSHED 
EDWARD THIS ISN'T ANYTHING NEW 
YOUR PICTURE WAS AIR AIRBRUSHED 
EVERY ACTOR HAS TO HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS 
TAKEN AGENTS AND DIRECTORS AND 
PRODUCERS AND IN MY EARLY DAY AS A 
YOUNG MAN EVERY ONE WAS WE CALLED 
IT TOUCHED UP THEY WERE TOUCHED 
UP AND ANY BLEMISHES WERE TAKEN OUT 
EYEBROWS WERE THINNED EYELASHES 
WERE PUT IN 
NOW THE TECHNOLOGY IS MORE 
SOPHISTICATED SOPHISTICATED THE BAD NEWS FOR CELEBRITIES AND 
THE GOOD NEWS FOR THE REST OF US IS 
THAT MAGAZINES COULD HAVE TO STOP 
AIR BRUSHING AND DIGITALLILY 
ENHANCING BODIES 
ANGELLICA BELL HAD SOME WORK DONE 
BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE THERE IS 
FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY IN THIS FILM 
I COULD ASK YOU DOES MY BUM LOOK 
BIG IN THIS BUT IT MIGHT AS WELL 
BE THE SIZE OF A DOUBLE DECKER 
BECAUSE IN THE MAGAZINE WORLD IT 
IS A WELL KNOWN SECRET THAT THE 
CAMERA DOESN'T ALWAYS TELL THE 
TRUTH TRUTH BUT ALL THAT COULD BE ABOUT TO 
CHANGE CHANGE AIR BRUSHING IS RIDICULOUSLY COMMON 
IN THE WORLD OF GLASSY WOMEN'S 
MAGAZINES BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS 
THE BRITISH FASHION COUNCIL ON THE 
BACK OF THE SIZE ZERO DEBATE 
LAUNCHED THE MODEL HEALTH INQUIRY 
AND THEY ARE CALLING UPON EDITORS 
OF GLOSSY MAGAZINES TO STOP SOME OF 
THIS DIGITALLY ENHANCING 
CELEBRITIES AND THE FASHION WORLD 
MOST PEOPLE KNOW WHAT CELEBRITIES 
LOOK LIKE THEY KNOW THEY ARE BEING 
CHEATED CHEATED I LOOK AT THE IMAGES OF THE MODELS 
AND I KNOW THEY ARE NOT REAL BUT 
THEY ARE CHANGED BUT I WOULD LIKE 
TO LOOK LIKE THAT 
IT IS SOMETHING 
TO ASPIRE TO 
YOU CAN'T HAVE UGLY PEOPLE IN MAGAZINE MAGAZINE WHEN IT COMES TO DIGITAL 
ENHANCEMENT CAN ANY LUMP OR BUMP 
BE BRUSHED UNDER THE CARPET 
WELL WE CAN TAKE AWAY BLEMISHES 
MAKE IT LOOK LIKE YOU'RE IN 
DIFFERENT PLACE SLIM YOUR FIGURE 
AND MAYBE STRETCH YOU MAKE YOU 
LOOK TALLER 
SO IT WOULD LOOK LIKE 
A DIFFERENT PICTURE YES YES THE AVERAGE SIZE OF BRITISH WOMAN 
IS SIZE SIXTEEN AND EIGHTY PER CENT OF BRITISH 
TEENAGERS SUFFER FROM SPOTS WHAT 
EFFECT ARE THE PICTURES OF 
PERFECTION HAVING ON THE REST OF 
US US THE WOMAN NEXT DOOR HAS LOST SIGHT 
OF WHAT A NORMAL WOMAN SHOULD LOOK 
LIKE THE MAGAZINE IMAGES THEY 
DRAW US IN THEY MAKE US THINK 
THAT'S AMAZING THAT'S HOW WE 
SHOULD LOOK THAT'S HOW THE PERFECT 
WOMAN IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK IF YOU 
DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT YOU ARE NOT 
TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF YOU ARE 
NOT EATING THE RIGHT FOOD AND NOT 
GOOD ENOUGH 
IT MAKES FEE FEEL A BIT PLAIN 
A BIT UGLY TO BE HONEST 
I FEEL INADEQUATE 
BUT ONE GIRL WHO STOOD UP FOR 
HERSELF AND BROKEN THE MOULD IS SEVENTEEN 
YEAR OLD MISS ENGLAND CONTENDER 
CHLOE MARSHALL 
WHAT'S BEEN THE REACTION TO YOU 
THE MEDIA WANT BEAUTY AS IN THE 
SIZE ZERO SKINNY LOOK THEY DON'T 
THINK THAT US CURVY WOMEN HAVE 
BEAUTY AND GOING INTO MISS ENGLAND 
AND STANDING UP AND THE OTHER WOMEN 
WATCHING ME IT WILL BE GOOD ALSO 
FOR ME AND FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY 
SHOW YOU KNOW I'VE DONE IT AND I'M 
UP HERE STANDING HERE TODAY 
WOULD YOU CONSIDER BEING 
AIRBRUSHED 
I WOULDN'T CONSIDER AIRBRUSHED BEING AIRBRUSHED BECAUSE THIS IS 
THE WAY I AM AND I LIKE MYSELF LIKE 
THIS THIS I AM GOING TO HAVE TO AGREE WITH 
CHLOE CHLOE THEY MAY SEE BEAUTY IS IN THE EYE 
OF THE BEHOLDER BUT WHEN YOUR EYES 
IS BEING TRICKED TO BELIEVE EVERY 
WOMAN IN A GODDESS I WOULD OPT FOR 
BEING OPTING OUT RATHER THAN BEING 
AIRBRUSHED AIRBRUSHED WE CAN LOOK AT YOUR BEFORE AND 
AFTER AFTER YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS YET 
THIS IS THE BIG REVEAL WE WILL 
DECIDE WHICH WE PREFER 
THIS IS 
YOU 
BEFORE BEFORE YOU'RE LOOKING FINE THERE 
YOU'RE LOOKING FINE 
I'M A BIG GIRL 
YOU'RE NOT A BIG GIRL YOU'RE A 
BEAUTIFUL GIRL 
IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT 
LET'S SEE HOW THEY IMPROVED HER 
NO NO IT LOOKS LIKE I WEAR A CORSET

A CORSET THAT DOESN'T 
FIT FIT MY ARMS LOOK SKINNY 
YOUR WAIST IS THINNER I PREFER THE 
BEFORE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
I PREFER 
THE BEFORE BUT THAT WOULD NOT 
THEY WOULDN'T BE HAPPY A MAGAZINE 
PERSON WOULDN'T PUT IT ON THE FRONT 
OF A COVER 
IT LOOKS MORE UNNATURAL 
I AM NOT 
THAT TALL IN REAL LIFE 
THEY USE TODAY DO IT TO ME ALL THE 
TIME TIME HOW COULD THEY IMPROVE ON 
PERFECTION PERFECTION YOU WERE THE SEXIEST MAN IN BRITAIN 
AT ONE TIME 
SHUT UP 
MICHELLE IS WATCHING 
WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT TASTES WHEN 
IT COMES TO ART AND WE HAVE COME 
ACROSS MAN WHO RECKONS HE CAN 
TELL EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO KNOW 
ABOUT YOU FROM WHAT YOU HAVE GOT ON 
YOUR WALLS 
PHIL TUFNELL IS TESTING THIS MAN'S 
THEORIES OUT WITH LOOK AT ART 
BELONGING BELONGING TO ONE SHOW VIEWER IN BELFAST BELFAST MY FIRST STOP IN BELFAST IS THE OLD 
MUSEUM ART CENTRE HAVE ARRANGED 
ME OWN DISPLAY THREE PIECES OF 
ARTWORK OWNED BY DARREN BAIRD 
DARREN AGREED TO SEE IF HIS CHOICE 
OF ARTWORK REVEALS MUCH ABOUT HIS 
PERSONALITY HE IS A DIRECTOR OF 
MUSIC AT HIS CHURCH AND TEACHES 
PIANO AND OBOE IN A COLLEGE 
GL DOING THE REVEALING IS DOCTOR TOMAS 
CHAMORRO PREMUZIC CHAMORRO PREMUZIC YOU SAY YOU CAN TELL LOT ABOUT 
SOMEONE FROM WHAT THEY HANG ON 
THEIR WALLS 
LOOKING AT PEOPLE'S ART PREFERENCES 
CAN TELL US ABOUT THE WAY THEY ARE 
THEIR PERSONALITIES 
WE HAVE THREE VARIED ONES FROM ONE 
OF OF OUR VIEWERS LET'S SEE WHAT 
YOU THINK 
THOMAS KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT WHO OWNS 
THE PICTURES 
WE HAVE PHOTOGRAPH 
WHAT DOES THIS ONE TELL YOU ABOUT 
THE PERSON 
THE FIRST THING WE HAVE TO SAY IS 
THAT 
THAT IT IS A PHOTOGRAPH 
IT IS NOT A PAINTING A BIT OF 
REALISM THERE AT THE SAME TIME IT 
IS AN EMOTIONAL PICTURE IT IS 
SHOWING THERE IS NOBODY SITTING 
THERE BUT WE CAN ALMOST IMAGINE 
THE PERSON WHO OWNS THE PICTURE 
SITTING ON THAT TABLE IN THAT CAFE 
DOES THIS THIS GIVE YOU ANY CLUES 
OF THE GENDER 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO 
SAY AT THIS STAGE L. WOULD SAY IT 
IS A WOMAN BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT 
THE OTHER PICTURES FIRST 
WE HAVE THE SINGING HORSEMAN BY 
JACK YATES WHAT DOES THAT TELL 
YOU 
IT IS MORE ARTISTIC IT IS A YOU SINGING PERSON AND IT IS A MUSICAL 
PICTURE IT IS EXPRESSIONIST AND 
DRAMATIC DRAMATIC WHAT IT SHOWS IS THAT SENSE OF HIGH 
EMOTIONALITY AND MOOD WE CAN SEE A 
PATTERN FROM THE FIRST TO THE 
SECOND ONE BUT ALSO A FEW 
DIFFERENCES DIFFERENCES AND THEN WE MOVE ON TO HERE THE 
TAKING OF CHRIST WOW 
WHAT A DIFFERENCE 
I THINK WE CAN STILL SEE IT IS A 
HIGHLY EMOTIONAL PICTURE IT IS 
DRAMATIC AND REVEALS A HIGHER LEVEL 
OF INTELL INTELLECTUAL ARTISTIC AND 
CULTURAL LEVEL OF THIS PERSON L. 
DON'T THINK THE PERSON IS 
INTERESTED IN THE RELIGIOUS 
CONNOTATION L. WOULD SAY IT IS A MAN MAN IT IS A BLOKE 
VERY OPEN MINDED 
BROAD ARTISTIC INTERESTS AND VERY 
EMOTIONAL AND PASSIONATE MY GUESS 
WOULD BE 
TO THIRTY FIVE YEARS OLD 
THIS IS SPOOKY BECAUSE THE PERSON 
WHO OWNS ALL THIS LOVELY ART IS A 
BLOKE HE IS IN HIS THIRTIES AND WE'RE 
GOING TO SEE HIM TO SEE IF HE 
AGREES WITH YOU 
WE ARE OFF TO DARREN'S IN EAST 
BELFAST TO SEE WHERE A THE 
PAINTINGS USUALLY HANG 
EXPLAIN WHY YOU LIKE THE PAINTINGS 
FOR EXAMPLE THE CAFE OF VENICE I 
LOOK GOING TO THE CAFE IF THERE IS 
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND L. LOVE 
SITTING THERE AND MAYBE WRITING AND 
THINKING ABOUT LIFE 
I COULD EASILY PASS AN AFTERNOON 
AND I AM A COFFEE ADDICT 
A BIT OF THINKER YOU SAID 
AND COFFEE ADDICT 
THOMAS 
I GOT THAT ONE MOSTLY RIGHT THOMAS I SAID IT REFLECTED THINKING WE 
FOUND IT WAS MOODY AND NOSTALGIC 
PICTURE DO YOU THINK THAT'S RIGHT 
I HAVE MY MOMENTS OF MOODINESS AND 
NOSTALGIA NOSTALGIA THAT'S NOT BAD START 
THE SINGING HORSEMAN 
I THOUGHT IT 
WAS FULL OF LIFE AND COLOUR AND 
VERY FULL OF EXPRESSION AND I LOVED 
THE CONCEPT OF THIS GUY ON A HORSE 
SINGING HIS HEAD HEAD THROWN BACK 
I'M A SINGER AND MUSICIAN 
HOLD ON 
WE HAVE GOT ANOTHER ONE HAVEN'T 
WE WHY DID YOU GO FOR THAT FAITH FAITH IS IMPORTANT TO ME AND I WENT TO 
SEE IT AND IT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION 
AND I DID LOOK AT IT FOR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY 
MINUTES I WAS MESMERISED BY IT 
I THINK WE GOT THAT ONE WE SAID IT 
WAS EMOTIONAL AND DRAMATIC AND MORE 
EMOTIONAL THAN THE OTHER TWO WE 
DID SAY IT WAS DRAMATIC AND VERY 
PASSIONATE DO THINK I THINK 
PERHAPS YOU DISAGREE WITH ME ON 
THIS ONE THAT THE THREE PICTURES 
HAVE A VERY STRONG NOSTALGIC AND 
DRAMATIC PEEL FEEL TO THEM 
WOULD YOU SAY THAT ABOUT YOURSELF 
I'M A MUSICIAN I'M TEMPERAMENTAL 
PASSIONATE AND OBVIOUSLY PASSIONATE 
ABOUT YOUR FAITH 
YES PASSIONATE 
ABOUT MY FAITH AND IT IS NICE TO BE 
CALLED INTELLECTUAL SO I WILL 
AGREE AGREE IT IS NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE BUT 
WHAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR WALL REALLY 
DOES TELL PEOPLE A LOT ABOUT YOUR 
CHARACTER CHARACTER PHIL TUFNELL AND HIS CHARACTER ART 
WE SHOULD MENTION EDWARD'S MUSICAL 
CAREER YOU HAVE MORE ALBUMS THAN 
CLIFF RICHARD AND THAT LITTLE GIRL 
IS AT THE NATIONAL THEATRE 
I DIDN'T BRING THESE ALONG THEY 
FOUND THEM 
WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU ON 
THE BILL 
RONAN KEATING WILL BE HERE TOMORROW 
WE WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW AT SEVEN HUNDRED P. M. 
THESE ARE NO ORDINARY KIDS 
THEY'RE SUPERKIDS GENETICALLY DESIGNED TO BEAT ADULTS 
JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN I'VE GOT QUITE A LOT STORED UP HERE 
I'M TWENTY SIX HE'S THIRTEEN SO ACCORDING TO ME HE'S HALF AS INTELLIGENT 
YOU WANNA FIND OUT WHO WINS 
JOIN US AND SEE IF THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT
