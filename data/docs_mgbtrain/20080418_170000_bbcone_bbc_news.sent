DOWN WITH THE BRITISH DOWN WITH 
THIEVES WHO WANT TO STEAL OUR 
COUNTRY THE WORDS OF PRESIDENT 
ROBERT MUGABE HE MADE A DEFIANT 
SPEECH TO THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS 
AT A STADIUM IN HARARE IT WAS TO 
MARK ZIMBABWE'S INDEPENDENCE DAY 
AND WAS HIS FIRST MAJOR SPEECH 
SINCE THE DISPUTED ELECTIONS THE 
B. B. C. IS BANNED FROM REPORTING FROM 
ZIMBABWE ALAN LITTLE SENT THIS 
REPORT FROM JOHANNESBURG 
TWENTY EIGHT YEARS TO THE DAY SINCE THE 
EUPHORIC BIRTH OF WHAT WAS THEN 
AFRICA'S YOUNGEST AND MOST 
PROMISING DEMOCRACY ROBERT MUGABE 
IS MORE AND MORE RELIANT ON ARMED 
FORCES TO STAY IN POWER AND 
INCREASINGLY ON NORTH KOREA AND 
CHINA FOR THE MILITARY SUPPORT HE 
NEEDS AS HE SEES IT ZIMBABWE IS 
NOT IN ECONOMIC COLLAPSE AND 
LOCKDOWN IT IS AT WAR BRITISH 
IMPERIALISM IS AT WORK EVERYWHERE 
THE BRITISH WANT TO STEAL THE 
COUNTRY HE SAYS AND TO THE M. D. C. 
THEY'RE PAID AGENTS HE SAID THIS 
WE NEED TO MAINTAIN UTMOST 
VIGILANCE IN THE FACE OFF VICIOUS 
BRITISH MUSH RELATIONS 
MACHINATIONS TODAY THEY RELY ON 
BRUTE FORCE TO SUBJUGATE OUR PEOPLE 
AND PLUNDER OUR RESOURCES TODAY 
THEY HAVE PERFECTED THEIR TACTICS 
TO MORE SUBTLE FORMS THEY THROUGH 
MONEY AS WEAPON LITERALLY BY 
SOME OF OUR PEOPLE TO TURN AGAINST 
THEIR GOVERNMENT 
THERE WAS NO 
MENTION OF THE DISPUTED ELECTION 
NO MENTION OF WHY THREE WEEKS ON 
THE RESULT HAS NOT BEEN ANNOUNCED 
IT IS THE SAD COLLAPSE OF A ONCE 
BRIGHT HOPE ROBERT MUGABE HIMSELF 
HAD BEEN JAILED BY THE BRITISH ON 
HIS RELEASE HE WENT TO THE BUSH TO 
FIGHT IN LIBERATION WAR WHEN IT 
WAS OVER HE REACHED OUT TO INCLUDE 
FORMER ENEMIES IN THE NEW NATION 
IT WAS INSPIRING AND ADMIRED 
EVERYWHERE 
THERE CAN NEVER BE ANY EVERYWHERE RETURN TO THE STATE OF ARMED 
CONFLICT WHICH EXISTED BEFORE OUR 
COMMITMENT TO PEACE AND THE 
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS OF ELECTION 
UNDER THE LANCASTER HOUSE AGREEMENT 
SURELY THIS IS NOW TIME TO BEAT 
OUR SWORDS INTO PLOUGHSHARES IN IN SOUTH AFRICA TRADE UNIONS HAVE 
SAID THEY WILL NOT OFFLOAD A 
CONSIGNMENT OF WEAPONS SHIPPED 
FROM CHINA TO THE PORT OF DURBAN 
AND BOUND FOR ZIMBABWE WHEN MANY 
ZIMBABWEANS ON GOING HUNGRY THIS 
CARGO IS SAID TO INCLUDE THREE MILLION 
KALASHNIKOV ROUNDS ROCKET 
PROPELLED GRENADES AND MORTAR 
LAUNCHERS THE OPPOSITION M. D. C. WILL 
SEE THE ARMS SHIPMENT AS CONSISTENT 
WITH MR. MUGABE'S CHOSEN METHOD OF 
STAYING IN POWER THEY ACCUSE HIM 
OF MILITARISING THE POLITICAL 
BATTLE AND OF PLANNING TO WAGE WAR 
ON THE ZIMBABWEAN PEOPLE THEIR 
LEADER MORGAN TSVANGIRAI SAYS 
THEY ARE NOW NO CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER 
WHICH HE WILL CONTEST A SECOND 
ROUND RUN OFF THAT MEANS ROBERT 
MUGABE WILL STAY IN POWER BUT 
BEARD DENIED ELECTION VICTORY 
THAT HE WANTS 
BRITAIN'S SECOND BIGGEST BANK THE 
ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND IS TO ASK 
SHAREHOLDERS FOR MONEY POSSIBLY AS 
MUCH AS TEN BILLION THE BANK 
WHICH OWNS NATWEST IS HAVING TO 
SHORE UP FINANCES BECAUSE OF LOSSES 
LINKED TO THE U. S. HOUSING MARKET 
SLUMP BUT THE BANKS ARE EXPECTED 
TO FOLLOW THEIR LEAD 
IN IT IS THE LATEST TWIST IN THE 
CREDIT CRISIS SAGA WHICH APPEARS 
TO BE AFFECTING EVERY LEADING BANK 
AND IS PUSHING UP BORROWING COSTS 
FOR MILLIONS THE ROYAL BANK OF 
SCOTLAND THE TWO IN THE U. K. IS 
HAVING TO GO CAP IN HAND TO 
SHAREHOLDERS AND RAISED A 
STAGGERING TEN BILLION IT IS A 
DRAMATIC REVERSAL IN FORTUNES IT 
HAS HAD TO COME UP WITH THE PLAN IN 
THE WAKE OF FINANCIAL TURMOIL LAST 
AUGUST THE BANK'S MARKET VALUE WAS 
FIFTY SEVEN BILLION SINCE THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH TOOK HOLD IT HAS FALLEN TO 
AROUND THIRTY SEVEN BILLION CRITICS SAY RBS 
PAID TOO MUCH TO TAKE OVER A. B. N. AMRO 
IN A CONSORTIUM NOW THEY ARE 
UNHAPPY THAT RBS IS ASKING 
SHAREHOLDERS TO STUMP UP TEN 
BILLION 
WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO BILLION INVESTORS TODAY TO SAY THEY ARE 
LIVID IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT HENCE 
HEADS WILL HAVE TO ROLL WHETHER 
THAT IS THE CHAIRMAN REMAINS TO BE 
SEEN BUT CERTAINLY INVESTORS WANT 
BLOOD 
SOME SHAREHOLDERS ARE MORE BLOOD SYMPATHETIC TO RBS WITH 
SPECULATION OTHER BANKS WILL ALSO 
HAVE TO RAISE FUNDS TO BOLSTER 
THEIR BALANCE SHEETS MOST HAVE 
BEEN HIT BY THE U. S. HOUSING MARKET 
SLUMP AND LOSSES ON LOANS TO HOME 
BUYERS THERE ON TUESDAY BANK 
CHIEFS WENT TO NUMBER TEN DOWNING 
STREET TO DISCUSS HOW TO RELIEVE 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH INCLUDING SIR 
FRED GOODWIN OF RBS SEEN ON THE 
LEFT IT IS BELIEVED THE PRIME 
MINISTER AGREED TO DO HIS BIT AS 
LONG AS BANKS DID THEIRS WHILE BIG 
BANKS IN THE CITY OF LONDON 
CONTINUED TO SHORE UP THEIR 
FINANCES THERE WILL NOT BE ANY 
MORE GENEROSITY TO BORROWERS LIKE 
MORTGAGE CUSTOMERS WHO ARE SEEING 
NEW DEALS BECOMING MORE EXPENSIVE 
THIS WEEK PRICES FOR SOME NEW 
CUSTOMERS HAVE GONE UP AGAIN RBS 
HAS RAISED FIXED RATE MORTGAGES UP 
TO OH EIGHT PER CENT NATWEST HIKED SOME 
VARIABLE RATES BY UP TO OH SIX 
HALIFAX HAS INCREASED TWO YEAR 
TRACKER DEALS BY OH FIVE PER CENT 
SOME PEOPLE 
CAN NO LONGER ACCESS SUCH 
COMPETITIVE RATES OR PRODUCTS AS 
THEY HAVE BECOME USED TO THEY 
WOULD LIKE TO GET BACK TO A MORE 
NORMAL MARKET SITUATION 
AS LONG AS 
BANKS LIKE RBS ARE OVERSTRETCHED 
THERE WILL STILL BE A SQUEEZE ON 
MORTGAGE CUSTOMERS 
WELL OUR BUSINESS EDITOR IS HERE 
HOW DO YOU MISS THIS ASSISTS 
ASSESS THIS 
ON THE ONE HAND RBS 
DESPERATELY NEEDS THE MONEY ON THE 
OTHER HAND IF IT RAISES TEN 
BILLION AND THE CITY DOES BELIEVE 
IT WILL GET BACK RECORD BREAKING 
AMOUNT OF MONEY IT WILL PROBABLY 
EMERGE AS ONE OF THE STRONGEST 
BANKS IN THE U. K. BUT HERE IS THE 
THING I HAVE LEARNED TONIGHT THAT 
NEXT WEEK IT WILL ALSO DISCLOSE 
THAT ITS LOSSES ON SUBPRIME LENDING 
AND ASSOCIATED FOOLISH LOANS AND 
INVESTMENTS WILL TOTAL ABOUT FIVE 
BILLION THAT IS A RECORD FOR A 
BRITISH BANK IT IS ON A PAR WITH 
SOME OF THE LOSSES WE HAVE SEEN 
FROM THE WORLD'S BIGGEST BANKS 
ELSEWHERE AGAIN THAT MAY SOUND 
LIKE TERRIBLE NEWS BUT I THINK 
INVESTORS WILL TAKE HEART FROM THAT 
THEY WILL SEE IT AS A WELCOME 
RECOGNITION THAT THE ROYAL BANK OF 
SCOTLAND IS OWNING UP TO THE 
MISTAKES OF ITS PAST IT IS 
RECOGNISING IN A FULL AND FRANK 
WAY THAT IT HAS DONE SILLY THINGS 
AND IT IS RAISING MONEY TO FILL THE 
HOLE ALTHOUGH IT SOUNDS LIKE VERY 
BAD NEWS IF IT GETS ITS MONEY THAN 
I THINK CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS 
WILL THINK THAT IS A BETTER END TO 
A RATHER TERRIBLE SAGA THAN THEY 
MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED 
THE FORMER PARTNER OF KAREN 
MATTHEWS WHOSE DAUGHTER SHANNON 
MATTHEWS WENT MISSING IN DEWSBURY 
HAS BEEN ARRESTED BY POLICE IN 
CONNECTION WITH HER DISAPPEARANCE 
POLICE SAY CRAIG MEEHAN WAS 
ARRESTED YESTERDAY AND BAIL 
PENDING FURTHER INVESTIGATION 
EARLIER TODAY HE APPEARED IN COURT 
ON CHARGES OF POSSESSING INDECENT 
IMAGES OF CHILDREN ON HIS COMPUTER

POLICE IN JERSEY SAY THEY HAVE 
FOUND BLOODSTAINED ITEMS IN CELL 
AT THE FORMER CHILDREN'S HOME HAUT 
DE LA GARENNE THEY FOUND THE ITEMS 
IN THE FINAL PELL FOUR CELLARS IN 
WHICH VICTIMS SAY THEY WERE ABUSED 
IT IS AT THE CENTRE OF MAJOR 
INVESTIGATION AFTER COMPLAINTS FROM 
RESIDENTS RESIDENTS GORDON BROWN HAS ARRIVED AT THE J. F. 
K. PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY IN BOSTON TO 
GIVE WHAT HAD BEEN BILLED AS A 
MAJOR FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH ON THE 
LATEST LEG OF HIS AMERICAN TOUR HE 
HAS BEEN MET BY SENATOR TED KENNEDY 
AND HAS JUST SPOKEN OF THE NEED FOR 
GLOBAL PROBLEMS TO BE MET WITH GLOBAL SOLUTIONS 
THESE ARE ALL CHALLENGES WHICH 
POINT IN ONE DIRECTION TO THE 
URGENT NECESSITY FOR GLOBAL 
CORPORATION NONE OF THESE 
CHALLENGES FROM THE ECONOMY TO THE 
ENVIRONMENT CAN BE SOLVED WITHOUT 
US FINDING NEW WAYS AS A WORLD OF 
WORKING MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER 
NICK ROBINSON IS IN BOSTON THIS IS 
BILLED AS MAJOR FOREIGN POLICY 
SPEECH WHAT ELSE DID HE HAVE TO 
SAY 
WELL IT IS A HUGELY AMBITIOUS SAY SPEECH HE TAUGHT AT ONE POINT BACK 
ROW OF REORDERING THE WORLD HE IS 
TRYING TO HAVE INVOKED THE IDEALISM 
FROM PRESIDENT KENNEDY SAYING THAT 
NO COUNTRY CAN ACT ALONE COUNTRIES 
HAVE TO ACT TOGETHER THAT WILL 
MEAN MORE POWERFUL INSTITUTIONS 
INTERNATIONALLY A STRENGTHENED UN 
AND WORLD BANK NOT JUST TO HELP 
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BUT DEAL WITH 
CLIMATE CHANGE A MORE POWERFUL I. M. F. 
TO AVOID THE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS WE 
HAVE SEEN HE IS ARGUING THAT NEW 
AMERICAN LEADERSHIP WITH A NEW 
PRESIDENT NEXT YEAR TOGETHER WITH 
THE NEW LEADERS IN FRANCE GERMANY 
AND ITALY CAN CO OPERATE WHAT HE 
DOESN'T SAY BUT IS CLEARLY 
IMPLICIT IS PUT BEHIND YOU DO 
GEORGE BUSH YEARS WHERE IT IS ALL 
ABOUT GOING IT ALONE NOW IS THE 
ERA OF CO OPERATION 
HE WOULD BE 
PLEASED THAT HE WILL NOT BE 
PLEASED THAT THIS YEAR BACK HERE 
THAT HAS BEEN A ROW ABOUT THE TEN 
PENCE TAX 
NOT PLEASED IS 
UNDERSTATING IT SIGNIFICANTLY IT 
IS CLEAR NOW THAT ON THIS TRIP THE 
PRIME MINISTER IS NOT MERELY 
FRUSTRATED HE IS FURIOUS 
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER HE GOT HIS 
LAST BUDGET AS CHANCELLOR WRONG 
HAVE DOCTOR ON THIS PARTICULAR TRIP 
YESTERDAY HE WAS FORCED TO TAKE A 
PHONE CALL FROM A MINISTERIAL AIDE 
WHO WAS THREATENING TO RESIGN 
TODAY THREE MORE HAVE MADE IT 
CLEAR THEY ARE UNHAPPY AT THAT 
POLICY THAT HE INTRODUCED OF 
SCRAPPING THE LOWER RATE OF TAX HE 
INSISTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
MISUNDERSTOOD THE POLICY THAT MANY 
PEOPLE WOULD BE MUCH MUCH BETTER 
OFF AS A RESULT FOR THOSE THAT 
HOPED HE MIGHT SAY I HEAR WHAT YOU 
SAY I UNDERSTAND YOUR WORRIES 
THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF 
GORDON BROWN CONCEDING TO THE 
GROWING NUMBER OF REBELS IN HIS OWN 
PARTY THE TRUTH IS HERE HE 
BELIEVES HE IS DOING VITAL BUSINESS 
NOT JUST FOR BRITAIN BUT FOR THE 
WORLD BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS AND 
MAKING IMPORTANT ARGUMENTS L. THINK 
HE CAN'T BELIEVE THAT HE IS HAVING 
TO FACE QUESTIONS ABOUT TROUBLES IN 
HIS OWN PARTY 
OUR TOP STORY THREE MEN AND JAILED 
FOR NEARLY SIXTY YEARS FOR MURDER THE 
JUDGE SAID THEY ACTED LIKE PACK 
OF HYENAS 
COMING UP WE WILL BE LIVE FROM LAS 
VEGAS AS JOE CALZAGHE GOES FOR A 
RECORD UNBEATEN IN FORTY FIVE FIGHTS 
ON B. B. C. LONDON TRACKING YOUR TRASH 
WHY PUTTING RUBBISH OUT TOO EARLY 
COULD LAND YOU A FINE AND THE 
WHOLE WORLD AS A STAGE MEET THE 
THEATRE GROUP BRINGING SHAKESPEARE 
TO THE SHOPPING AISLES 
A CONTROLLED EXPLOSION IS TAKING 
PLACE IN BRISTOL AFTER A MAN WAS 
ARRESTED IN THE TERRORISM ACT HE 
WAS ARRESTED AFTER A RAID AT HIS 
HOME IN COMBE PADDOCK POLICE HAVE 
BEEN GRANTED SEVEN MORE DAYS TO 
QUESTION HIM THIRTY RESIDENTS 
EVACUATED ARE STILL WAITING TO 
RETURN TO THEIR HOMES DANIEL 
SANDFORD IS IN WESTBURY ON TRYM AT AT MIDNIGHT A CONVOY OF POLICE 
VEHICLES ARRIVED ACCOMPANYING THE 
ARMY BOMB DISPOSAL UNIT ALL 
BECAUSE OF THE ARREST OF A WHITE 
BRITISH MUSLIM CONVERT CALLED 
ANDREW IBRAHIM 
IT WAS THE NIGHT 
THAT THE BOMB SQUAD CAME TO A QUIET 
BRISTOL SUBURB POLICE OFFICERS 
HAVE BEEN UNDERSCORED HIS AT ALL 
DAY IT BEGAN WITH THIRTY RESIDENTS 
BEING EVACUATED IN THE MIDDLE OF 
THE NIGHT THEN A CONTROLLED 
EXPLOSION 
IT WAS AN ALMIGHTY BANG EXPLOSION I THOUGHT DICKENS WHAT IS THAT 
MY SON WAS UP AND WE LOOKED OUT OF 
THE WINDOW IN DISBELIEF WE SAW 
EVERYTHING HERE 
THE NINETEEN YEAR OLD 
WHITE MAN WHO LIVED AT THE HOUSE 
WAS ARRESTED YESTERDAY AFTERNOON 
FOLLOWING A TIP OFF POLICE WILL 
NOT SAY WHAT THE INTELLIGENCE WAS 
HIS NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOURS TOLD ME HE 
MOVED IN A FEW WEEKS AGO THEY ONLY 
MET HIM WHEN THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT 
ALLOWED ISLAMIC MUSIC 
I REMEMBER THINKING IT WAS VERY ODD 
I COULD HEAR TEN OR TWELVE VARIOUS BOLTS 
AND LOCKS AND KEYS BEING UNDONE 
WHICH WAS VERY STRANGE AND WHEN HE 
OPENED THE DOOR HE WAS WEARING 
THIS KIND OF WHITE GOWN AND I 
REMEMBER FEELING QUITE UNNERVED IT 
IS NOT CLEAR WHY POLICE CARRIED OUT 
A CONTROLLED EXPLOSION ON A 
CONTAINER FOUND IN THE HOUSE BUT 
DETECTIVES SAY INVESTIGATIONS AT 
THE PROPERTY WILL TAKE SEVERAL MORE 
DAYS DAYS THE IS ARREST HAS BEEN MADE AT THIS 
STAGE TO PREVENT HARM THIS IS 
LIKELY TO BE A PROLONGED 
INVESTIGATION IT IS COMPLEX AND 
SENSITIVE INQUIRY WHICH MAY TAKE 
SOME TIME TO RESOLVE IT IS 
UNLIKELY THAT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN 
EVACUATED WILL BE ABLE TO RETURN TO 
THEIR HOMES UNTIL MUCH LATER TODAY 
AVON AND SOMERSET POLICE ARE 
WORKING WITH SCOTLAND YARD'S 
COUNTER TERRORISM COMMAND AND THE 
SECURITY SERVICE M. I. FIVE TO SEE IF THE 
MAN HAS ANY CONNECTIONS TO KNOWN 
EXTREMISTS OR TERRORISTS IT IS NOT 
OVER YET HALF AN HOUR AGO I WAS

FOR SAFETY REASONS MOVED US

WITH BERNARD HOPKINS HOPKINS IS FORTY THREE 
YEARS OLD BUT HE IS IN TIP TOP 
CONDITION JOE CALZAGHE IS THE KING 
OF THE SUPER MIDDLEWEIGHT DIVISION

WORLDWIDE RECOGNITION THAT HE SO 
WHITE FULLY DESERVES SO HE HAS

SUNDAY MORNING 
NOW IT IS THE RICHEST CRICKET 
TOURNAMENT IN THE WORLD AND THIS 
AFTERNOON IT BEGAN IN STYLE THE 
INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE HAS 
CHEERLEADERS SOME OF THE BEST 
PLAYERS AND IT IS PAYING THEM 
FOOTBALL STYLE SALARIES EIGHT 
TEAMS ARE COMPETING HOPING TO MAKE 
IT TO THE FINAL IN MUMBAI IN JUNE 
BUT THERE IS CONCERN THAT THIS 
TOURNAMENT MIGHT CHANGE FOREVER THE 
WAY CRICKET HAS BEEN RUN 
CRICKET HAS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING 
LIKE IT 
THE NEW INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE 
COMPETITION THE PURISTS MAY 
SHUDDER THE GAME IS CHANGING THE 
BROADCASTING RIGHTS HAVE BEEN SOLD 
FOR ONE BILLION DOLLARS IT IS MODELLED ON 
ENGLISH PREMIERSHIP FOOTBALL CASH 
WHICH TEAMS BUYING IN THE BEST 
TALENT FROM AROUND THE WORLD THE 
HIGHEST SALARIES TOP ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PER 
WEEK NO WONDER THE PLAYERS ARE 
SMILING 
I FEEL I HAVE PROBABLY SMILING DESERVED A LOT MORE 
CRICKET SEEMS 
TO HAVE THE SAME MONEY NOW AS 
FOOTBALL 
YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK AT FOOTBALL WHAT THE T. V. RIGHTS HAVE GONE FOR 
HERE OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS THE MONEY IN 
CRICKET IN INDIA IS PHENOMENAL I 
THINK THE PLAYERS SHOULD SHARE IT 
ENGLISH STARS WILL NOT BE SETTING 
FOOT ON THE GRASS HOWEVER THE 
ENGLISH BOARD WILL NOT RELEASE THEM 
BUT THAT MAY HAVE TO CHANGE THE THE I. P. L. IS ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN WHAT 
HAPPENS ON THE PITCH HERE SUCH 
VAST SUMS HAVE BEEN PUMPED INTO IT 
THE QUESTION IS CAN CRITIC DELIVER 
THE WOW FACTOR THE PROFIT AND 
CRICKET SOME OF INDIA'S BIGGEST 
BUSINESSMEN THINK SO AND THAT'S 
WHY THEY ARE BACKING IT VIJAY 
MALLYA LIKES TO CALL HIMSELF THE 
KING OF INDIA'S GOOD TIMES THE 
TYCOON HAS SPENT OVER FIFTY MILLION 
ASSEMBLING HIS TEAM THE BANGALORE 
ROYAL CHALLENGERS AUSTRALIAN 
CARIBBEAN AND SOUTH AFRICAN PLAYERS 
HAVE ALL SIGNED FOR HIM THIS IS 
WHERE HE HAS MADE HIS BILLIONS 
INDIA'S AIRLINE BUSINESS HE OWNS 
THE BIGGEST AND ALSO IN DRINK HE 
IS INDIA'S LIQUOR BARON IS BREWING 
EMPIRE IS GOING GLOBAL AS ARE HIS 
AMBITIONS FOR CRICKET 
IF YOU ASK 
ME WHETHER I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A 
FEW ENGLISHMEN IN MY TEAM THE 
ANSWER IS YES IF YOU ASK ME 
WHETHER I AM ABLE TO ACQUIRE ANY OF 
THEM THE ANSWER IS I DON'T KNOW 
TONIGHT THE KOLKATA KNIGHT RIDERS 
VERSUS THE BANGALORE ROYAL 
CHALLENGERS COULD BE THE START OF A 
REVOLUTION CRICKET'S TRADITION 
COULD BE ABOUT TO BE SUPPLANTED BY 
INDIA'S BRASH STYLE 
NOW IF YOU WOKE UP THIS MORNING 
AND NOTICED BIT OF STINK DO 
NOT WORRY IT IS NOT YOUR DRAINS 
IT IS ALL DOWN TO FARMERS IN 
HOLLAND GERMANY AND BELGIUM WHO 
HAVE BEEN MUCK SPREADING AN 
EASTERLY BREEZE HAS BEEN BLOWING 
THE SMELL ACROSS THE CHANNEL AND AS 
FAR AS SOUTH EAST ENGLAND IT LOOKS 
AS THOUGH IT WILL CONTINUE UNTIL 
THE WEEKEND 
THERE WAS SOMETHING A BIT WILL ROLL 
IN THE AIR TODAY EVEN IN CENTRAL 
LONDON 
HORSE MANURE SOILED LONDON SOILED NAPPIES SEWAGE 
IT IS KIND OF POOM NAPPIES SEWAGE MIXED WITH VOMIT 
OXFORDSHIRE COULD 
SMELL IT DID FROM PIGS AND FARMS 
AND STUFF AND IN NORFOLK SO 
SOMETHING DEFINITELY HAS BEEN IN 
THE AIR THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS 
IT THIS MAN SMELT IT TOO WITH 
HIS VERY PROFESSIONAL KNOWS HE IS 
A WINE EXPERT AND WHEN IT COMES TO 
CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF ODOUR HE IS A 
MASTER YOU'RE AN EXPERT WHAT IS 
THIS SMILE 
BEING CHARITABLE 
HERBACEOUS GRASSY HYDROGEN 
SULPHIDE AND VOLATILE FATTY ACIDS 
COW MANURE 
SO WHERE DID IT COME 
FROM WELL THE WEATHER CENTRE HAS 
AN IDEA 
IT WAS THE FIRST THING I 
NOTICED WHEN I STEPPED OUT OF THE 
DOOR THIS MORNING AND THE SMELL 
COMES FROM AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRY 
IN GERMANY BELGIUM AND HOLLAND IT 
BUILT UP EARLIER THIS WEEK WHEN 
THE AIR WAS STAGNANT THEN WE HAD 
AN EASTERLY WIND WHICH KICKED IN 
PUSHING THAT POLLUTION THAT SMILE 
TOWARDS US THAT IS WHY MANY OF US 
THIS MORNING HAD A FARMYARD ODOUR 
WILL IT RETURN WELL WATCH THE 
WEATHER 
WE SAW HIM IN THAT REPORT AND AS 
IF BY MAGIC HE IS HERE NOW 
THAT SMELL WILL NOT COMPLETELY 
DISAPPEAR UNTIL WE LOSE THE 
EASTERLY COMPONENT OF THE WIND SO 
IT MAY CONTINUE INTO NEXT WEEK THE 
IMPACT OF THE WIND IS STILL WITH US 
OVERNIGHT A LITTLE LIGHT RAIN 
ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES AT THE 
MOMENT THAT WILL BE EASING 
ALTHOUGH LATER IN THE NIGHT THIS 
RAIN WILL BE PUSHING TOWARDS THE 
SOUTHERN COASTAL COUNTIES OF 
ENGLAND ELSEWHERE IT IS DRAWN 
DRY THE WIND IS TOO STRONG TO 
ALLOW THE TEMPERATURE TO DROP TOO 
FAR TOMORROW WILL BE DAMP TO BEGIN WITH 
THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE UNITED 
KINGDOM WILL BE FINE DRY AND 
BRIGHT SO IT IS NORTH SOUTH SPLIT TOMORROW 
IT SHOULD BE A LOVELY AFTERNOON FOR 
THE SCOTTISH GRAND NATIONAL IN THE 
FOR NORTH OF SCOTLAND THERE WILL 
BE ADDED A BIT MORE CLOUD THAN 
TODAY PERHAPS THE FAR NORTH 
BUT LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE FURTHER 
SOUTH THE CLOUD AND THE RAIN IS 
PUSHING FURTHER NORTH THE GUSTY 
WIND COULD BE UP TO FORTY M. P. H. OR 
STRONGER IN THE SOUTH WEST AND 
SOUTH WALES AS FOR SUNDAY STILL 
LITTLE LIGHT RAIN IN PLACES FOR 
ENGLAND AND WALES SOME BRIGHTNESS 
IS POSSIBLE DOWN TOWARDS THE FAR 
SOUTH BEFORE THE NEXT BATCH OF 
RAIN COMES UP FROM THE SOUTH BUT 
THE NORTH WILL BE STAYING BRIGHT 
THE MAIN MESSAGE FOR THE WEEKEND 
NORTH IS BEST FOR THE SUNSHINE 
TONIGHT MORE JOB CUTS HIT THE CITY 
AS THE WORLD'S LARGEST BANK 
ANNOUNCES BILLIONS IN LOSSES I I REALLY PREDICT IT IS
