EUROPE ABU QATADA HAS BEEN GRANTED 
BAIL AND WILL BE SEEN RELEASED FROM 
PRISON HOW 
THIS SQUARE WITH 
FIGHTING TERRORISM TONIGHT TONIGHT HE IS DESCRIBED AS BIN LADEN'S 
RIGHT HAND MAN NOW HE IS TO BE 
RELEASED IS THIS MORE EVIDENCE OF 
A BATTLE BETWEEN THE JUDICIARY AND 
THE GOVERNMENT MORE ON NATIONAL 
SECURITY AFTER LAST NIGHT'S 
SECURITY AFTER LAST NIGHT'S REVELATIONS ABOUT AIRPORTS 
NEWSNIGHT ASKS WHAT ELSE IS NOT 
DOING CRIMINAL CHECKS ON 
FOREIGNERS AND THE BURMESE JUNTA 
IS REFUSING MOST OFFERS OF AID TO 
ITS STRICKEN PEOPLE WE ASK THE 
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT SECRETARY 
IF RELIEF PLANES AND HELICOPTERS 
SHOULD DO GO IN ANYWAY 
AND MARK URBAN IS HAS THE SECOND IN 
OUR FRONTLINE AFGHANISTAN SPECIAL 
REPORTS REPORTS AFGHANISTAN EXPERIENCES SUICIDE 
BOMBS EVERY DAY MANY OF THE 
PERPETRATORS COME FROM PAKISTAN 
I'LL BE UNCOVERING DETAILS OF THE 
SECRET WAR TO STOP THEM 
GOOD EVENING THE NEWS THAT THE 
EXTREMIST ISLAMIC CLERIC ABU 
QATADA IS TO BE RELEASED FROM LONG 
LARTIN JAIL IS ACCORDING TO THE 
SHADOW ATTORNEY GENERAL PROOF THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT OF 
CLOSER TO DEALING 
WITH THE PROBLEM HE POSES LAST 
MONTH ABU QATADA ESCAPED 
DEPORTATION TO JORDAN WHERE THE 
LAWYERS ARGUED HE COULD FACE 
TORTURE OR ILL TREATMENT NOW THE 
SPECIAL IMMIGRATION APPEALS 
COMMISSION DECISION TO GRANT 
KHATAMI ALBEIT WITH THE STRICTEST 
OF CONDITIONS HAVE DEALT ANOTHER 
BLOW TO THE ANTI TERRORISM STRATEGY 
HERE IS TIM WHEWELL 
HE'S BEEN DESCRIBED BY A BRITISH 
JUDGE AS A TRULY DANGEROUS 
INDIVIDUAL BY THE GOVERNMENT AS 
A SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORIST WHOSE PRESENCE POSED A 
CONTINUING THREAT TO NATIONAL 
SECURITY BUT THE PREACHER WHO ONCE 
CALLED ON BRITISH MUSLIMS TO MARTYR 
THEMSELVES ON A HOLY WAR ON 
OPPRESSION WILL PROBABLY SOON BE 
RELEASED AFTER MORE THAN FIFE YEARS 
IN JAIL ABU QATADA FROM JORDAN 
IS SAID TO HAVE HAD LINKS WITH AT 
LEAST ONE OF THE NINE ELEVEN HI JACKERS 
TAPES OF HIS SERMONS WERE FOUND IN 
THE FLATS USED BY THE GERMAN 
BOMBERS BOMBERS KHATAMI KA ABU QATADA WAS THE 
MERGER FOR KIELD CAN KIELD IN 
EUROPE HE HELPED INDIVIDUALS TO 
TAKE UP ARMS TO SEE THE HOST 
NATIONS AS ENEMIES THERE ARE 
NUMBER OF EXAMPLES THAT HAVE THE 
HALLMARKS OF HIS GUIDANCE 
INCLUDING ONE IN BELGIUM INVOLVING 
A FOOTBALLER TURNED TERRORIST 
TARGETED A BELGIUM AIR BASE HE 
CITED ABU QATADA AS HIS IDEOLOGICAL 
INSPIRATION AND THERE ARE OTHER 
EXAMPLES IN COUNTRIES LIKE SPAIN 
AND GERMANY 
BUT ABU QATADA DENIED ALWAYS THAT 
HE WAS THE OSAMA BIN LADEN'S 
EUROPEAN AMBASSADOR OR THAT HE 
EVER MET THE AL QAEDA LEADER THE 
GOVERNMENT DID NOT HAVE THE 
EVIDENCE TO BRING HIM TO TRIAL IT 
USED ANTI TERROR MERS MEASURES 
BROUGHT IN AFTER NINE ELEVEN TO DETAIN 
HIM WITHOUT CHARGE HE WAS FINALLY 
ARRESTED IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND TWO AFTER 
GOING ON RUN HE WAS RELEASED THEN 
IMPRISONED AGAIN PEND PENDING 
ATTEMPTS BY THE GOVERNMENT TO 
DEPORT HIM LAST MONTH HE WON AL 
DEAL AGAINST DEPORTATION 
THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW APPEAL 
APPEALING ON THE DEPORTATION ISSUE 
IT HAS FAILED TO SHOW TO SPECIAL 
IMMIGRATION APPEALS COMMISSION THAT 
ABU QATADA SHOULD STAY IN PRISON 
THEY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THERE 
WAS NO NEED TO KEEP HIM IN JAIL 
THEN THEY DECIDED IT WOULD NOT BE 
SAFE TO LET HIM HAVE COMPLETE 
FREEDOM TO ROAM THE STREETS AS 
THEY SAY 
SO HE WILL BE ONLY ALLOWED OUT FOR 
TWO HOURS A DAY IN WHICH CASE HE 
CAN BE PUT UNDER CLOSE SURVEILLANCE 
HE CAN BE FOLLOWED AND THE 
SECURITY PEOPLE WILL MAKE SURE HE 
DOES NOT GET UP TO MISCHIEF WHILE 
HE IS ENJOYING HIS TWO HOURS OF 
FREEDOM FREEDOM DESPITE THE TOUGH BAIL CONDITIONS 
THE JUDGMENTS ARE SET BACKFOR THE 
GOVERNMENT THIS IS HOW THE HOME 
SECRETARY REACTED THIS EVENING 
OF LORDS IT SUSPECTS THE GOVERNMENT IS IN 
HAVE 
FALLEN APART 
BRITISH SOIL WITH 
JUDGMENT 
THAT 
THE RIGHT DECISION AND ABOUT THE LOSS 
TRIAL IN 
WOULD BE TO PUT HIM ON TRIAL IN THIS 
INTERCEPT EVIDENCE 
ARE LOOKING 
BRITISH SUPPORTERS ARE LOOKING FORWARD 
BACK AS 
HE BUT 
THEIR ATTEMPTS 
AVAILABLE TO SPEAK ON THE ISSUE TONIGHT 
LIBERAL 
INFORMATION IT IS 
GRANT HIM BAIL 
POLITICAL 
CAPITAL IF 
EVIDENCE HE 
BUT SO FAR THERE IS NO EVIDENCE HE HAS 
TO DETAIN SOMEBODY 
WAS SAYING WE 
GET THEM 
THIS IS WHERE THE 
WHERE IS THIS GOING 
LORD TOMAS 
ARE THE JUDICIARY RIGHT IN WHAT 
THEY ARE DOING IN THE WAY THEY ARE 
INTERPRETING THE LAW 
THEY ARE 
RIGHT THE MEMRANDA OF 
UNDERSTANDING ARE OBVIOUSLY 
MEMRANDA OF UNDERSTANDING ARE A 
DEVICE A DEVICE TO PUT PEOPLE BACK 
INTO COUNTRIES WHERE WE KNOW THEY 
ARE LIKELY TO BE TORTURED AND WE 
CANNOT ACCEPT ASSURANCE BY 
AUTHORITIES WHO HAVE INDULGED IN 
SUCH A TORTURE FOR A TIME 
BUT THIS IS COSTING A FORTUNE THE 
NEGOTIATIONS WE ARE TOLD THAT 
JORDAN WAS ONE OF THE COUNTRY IS 
COUNTRIES TO WHICH WE COULD RETURN 
PEOPLE THIS HAS COST TIEMENT 
OPPORTUNITY STILL WE CANNOT GET 
RID OF THE PEOPLE WHO AS SIAC SAY 
ARE DANGER TO THE PUBLIC AND YET 
THEY REMAIN 
BUT THIS MAN HAS SPENT FIVE YEARS 
IN PRISON THAT IS EQUIVALENT OF A 
TEN YEAR PRISON SENTENCE TO SAY 
THAT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED IS 
PUTTING IT A BIT HIGH 
WOULD IT NOT BE GOOD IDEA TO GO 
BACK TO HIS OWN COUNTRY TO SERVE 
HIS SENTENCE THERE 
NOT IF THE 
EVIDENCE OBTAINED BY TORTURE WE 
ARE SUBJECT TO INTERNATIONAL 
OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE ENTERED 
INTO PROPERLY WE WILL NOT RETURN 
PEOPLE TO COUNTRIES WHERE TORTURE 
IS TO BE CARRIED OUT THAT IS THE 
BASIS OF THE DECISION 
PATRICK AS A SHADOW MINISTER FORMER FORMER YES YOU WERE A PART OF A AS IT 
WERE SMALL TENT WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES 
THE SUCCESSIVE HOME SECRETARYS 
FROM DAVID B. L. BLUNKETT AND JOHN 
REID AND CHARLES CLARKE AND NOW 
JACQUI SMITH WHY IN YOUR VIEW IS 
THERE SUCH A CLASH 
I THINK IT IS 
POOR LEGISLATION THAT IS PASSED IN 
A HURRY WITHOUT CAREFUL THOUGHT AND 
PROPER TESTING AND MANY OF THE 
SUGGESTIONS COMING FORWARD HAVE 
BEEN IGNORED OUT I DON'T KNOW 
FROM BULL HEADEDNESS PERHAPS OR 
THOUGHTLESSNESS BUT THE 
COUNTERTERRORIST LJSHRAIGS THE 
ANTI TERRORIST LEGISLATION DOES NOT 
WORK WORK BUT YOU ACCEPT THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
IS DOING THE BEST IT THINKS IT CAN 
TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF THE 
COUNTRY 
OF COURSE L. DON'T THINK COUNTRY THERE IS MALICIOUS ATTEMPT ON THE 
PART OF THE HOME SECRETARY OF 
COURSE NOT BUT EACH TIME THE 
JUDISH AERBGS STANDS THE GOVERNMENT 
ON ITS HEAD L. WISH THAT THE 
SUGGESTIONS THAT THE OPPOSITION 
PARTIES HAD MADE FOR INSTANCE 
INTERCEPT EVIDENCE TO MY KNOWLEDGE 
I WAS A PRACTITIONER THIS HAS BEEN 
ON THE TABLE FOR AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS 
THIS ISSUE YET THIS WEEK WE HAVE 
BEEN TOLD IT IS NOT LIKELY TO BE 
USED IN COURT UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TEN AT THE 
EARLIEST EARLIEST LORD THOMAS DO YOU THINK THERE ARE 
CHANGES IN THE LAW THAT COULD MAKE 
THE PURSUIT OF TERRORISTS AND THE 
DETENTION OF TERRORISTS MORE SOUND 
I HAVE PRESSED ON THE HOUSE OF 
LORDS FOR YEARS FOR THE 
INTRODUDUCTION OF INTERCEPT 
EVIDENCE TO PUT BEFORE THE COURT 
AND A JURY THAT WHICH THE 
GOVERNMENTS HOLD TO THEMSELVES FOR 
SOME REASON OR OTHER I HAVE NEVER 
QUITE WORKED OUT WHY THE 
GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO 
DO WHAT IT HAS DONE IN ALMOST EVERY 
OTHER WESTERN COUNTRY EVIDENCE 
THAT OF OF THAT TIME IS USED IF 
HAS INCITED PEOPLE TO 
TERRORISM COMMITTED A CRIME THAT 
IS BEHIND EVERYTHING PUT HIM ON 
TRIAL PUNISH HIM ACCORDINGLY BUT 
TO SEND HIM BACK TO A COUNTRY WHERE 
HE IS GOING TO BE TORTURED ON THE 
BASIS OF SOME SORT OF MEMORANDUM OF 
SUNG NO GOOD AT ALL SEVEN REMEMBER 
THIS IT IS THE GOVERNMENT THAT 
MAKE THE LAWS THE JUDICIARY ONLY 
PUT THEM INTO EFFECT 
PATRICK DO YOU THINK THAT BOTH AT 
HOME AND INDEED INTERNATIONALLY 
THIS UNDERMINES THE GOVERNMENT'S 
ANTI TERRORIST STRATEGY AND THE 
ANTI TERRORIST STAND 
I'M AFRAID IT 
DOES IT MAKES THE GOVERNMENT LOOK 
FOOLISH SO MANY THINGS WE HAVE 
BEEN PROMISED FOR INSTANCE TONY 
BLAIR'S TWELVE POINT PLAN MUCH HAS NOT 
COME INTO PRACTISE L. REALLY 
QUESTION THE GOVERNMENT'S 
DETERMINATION DETERMINATION THANK YOU 
AFTER LAST NIGHT'S NUEZ NIGHT 
INVESTIGATION INTO AIRPORT SECURITY 
WE WERE DELUGED FROM E. MAILS FROM 
VIEWERS ASKING WHETHER WE COULD 
TRUST CHECKS ON TEACHERS DOCTORS 
TUBE DRIVERS AND EVERYONE ELSE 
SUPPOSED TO BE SCREEN ROBIN 
DENSELOW HAS BEEN CAUSING TURMOIL 
BY ASKING THE AWKWARD QUESTIONS 
THE SAME IS TRUE FOR LICENSED CAB 
DRIVERS OR THOSE WORKING IN THE 
S. ECURITY INDUSTRY AS GUARDS OR 
SECURITY INDUSTRY AS GUARDS OR BOUNCERS BOUNCERS BUT IN OTHER AREAS THERE ARE FAR 
MORE STRINGENT CHECKS TEACHERS ARE 
SUPPOSED TO BE THOROUGHLY VETTED 
ALL SCHOOLS OR EDUCATION 
AUTHORITIES SHOULD CHECK U. K. AND 
FOREIGN CRIMINAL RECORDS OF A 
POTENTIAL NEW RECRUIT THE SAME IS 
TRUE IN THE HEALTH SERVICE CHECKS 
SHOULD BE MADE WITH THE CRIMINAL 
RECORDS BUREAU AND OVERSEAS 
CRIMINAL RECORDS THEN THERE IS A 
FINAL CONFUSION SOME EMPLOYERS WHO 
CONTACTED US INCLUDING THOSE 
RUNNING A MAINOR CHAIN OF 
CHILDREN'S NURSERIES SAID THEY DID 
NOT REALISE THAT THE CRIMINAL 
RECORDS BUREAU DEALS WITH THOSE 
FROM THE U. K. THEY THOUGHT THAT A 
POTENTIAL EMPLOYIE HAD NO FOREIGN 
CONVICTIONS EVEN THOUGH THE C. R. B. 
MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THEY CANNOT 
ACCESS CURRENTLY OVERSEAS CRIMINAL 
RECORDS A GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN 
TOLD US THAT THE C. R. B. IS DEVELOPING 
AGREEMENTS TO EXCHANGE DATA WITH E. U. 
MEMBER STATES AND OTHER 
JURISDICTIONS FOR THE MOMENT IT 
IS EASIER GETTING JOB IF YOU HAVE 
A CONVICTION ABROAD RATHER THAN A 
CONVICTION IN BRITAIN 
IT HAS BEEN ANOTHER FRUSTRATING DAY 
FOR INTERNATIONAL AID WORKERS 
ATTEMPTING TO GET NEEDED SUPPLIES 
INTO BURMA TODAY THE UNITED 
NATIONS CRITICISED THE BURMESE 
AUTHORITIES FOR THE PROGRESS 
GETTING IN GETTING ACCESS TO THE 
ACCESS FOR THE AID NEEDED FOR THE 
VICTIMS I ASKED HOW MUCH 
ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN GOTTEN THROUGH 
TODAY TODAY IT'S A VERY FRUSTRATING DAY THE 
AID AIDS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO 
GET THERE THEY HAVE HAD NO CLEAR 
INFORMATION WE KNOW OF TWO UNITED 
NATIONS AIRCRAFT THAT DID GET INTO 
BURMA WITH VITAL SUPPLIES THEY ARE 
BRINGING IN HIGH ENERGY BUSINESS 
KITS THEY ARE ESSENTIAL FOR PEOPLE 
WITHOUT COOKING UTENSILS THERE ARE 
AT LEAST THREE OTHER UNITED NATIONS 
PLANES THAT HAVE NOT GOT PERMISSION 
TO LAND THAT IS CARRYING ABOUT FOUR 
TONNES OF EQUIPMENT AND THERE ARE 
TWO TONNES OF EQUIPMENT WAITING ON 
THE BORDER SO THE BROAD PICTURE IS 
THAT THE MILITARY RULERS OF BURMA 
ARE HESITANT ABOUT ALLOWING 
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF AID IN THEY 
ARE IMPOSING ALL SORTS OF OTHER 
RESTRICTIONS AID HELPERS ON THE 
GROUND ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE 
SATELLITE PHONES THE BURMESE ARE 
NOT ALLOWING THE DISASTER EXPERTS 
TO COME IN AND MAING THE SITUATION 
THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO SAVE LIVES 
WHAT INFLUENCE CAN 
THAILAND HAVE THAILAND HAS OFFERED ITS PRIME 
MINISTER HE IS TO FLY IN THE NEXT 
TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND TRY TO PERSUADE THEM 
TO ACCEPT THIS INTERNATIONAL RELIEF 
EFFORT BUT NOBODY CAN CONFIDENT 
THAT THIS WILL WORK BURMA'S 
GENERALS ARE OBSESSED WITH THEIR 
OWN SECURITY THEY ARE PARANOID 
ABOUT THE REFERENDUM THEY ARE 
HOLDING ON THE NEW CONSTITUTION ON 
SATURDAY THEY MAY NOT LISTEN TO 
ANYONE 
CAN THE INTERNATIONAL ANYONE COMMUNITY ACTING IN CONCERT BRING 
PRESSURE TO BARE OR BURMA 
UNFORTUNATELY PROBABLY NOT WE 
KNOW FROM LAST YEAR WHEN THE 
BURMESE GOVERNMENT CRACKED DOWN 
BRUTALLY ON ANTI GOVERNMENT 
DEMONSTRATIONS THAT THEY DID NOT 
LIST TONNE THE PRESSURE THEY MADE 
TOKEN GESTURES THE FEAR IS THAT 
THIS THAT IS WHAT THEY WILL DO HERE 
WE HAVE SEEN PLANES COMING IN 
CARRYING FAR LESS SUITABLE AID BUT 
THEY WANT TO KEEP THE UNITED 
NATIONS AT ARM'S LENGTH ALMOST FOR 
APPEARANCE SAKE THAT IS ENTIRELY 
INAPPROPRIATE WHEN YOU HAVE ONE 
MILLION PEOPLE WITHOUT FOOD HOMES 
IN A DESPERATE STATE 
DOUGLAS ALEXANDER SER THE 
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT SECRETARY 
I PUT IT TO HIM WITH THE JUNTA 
PROVING RESISTENT TO MUCH OF THE 
AID ON OFFER THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS 
FAILING THE PEOPLE OF BURMA 
WE ARE WORKING HARD TO WORK BOTH 
MULTILATERALY AND BALLOT REALLY RAY 
BILATERALY TO GET THE ACCESS SO 
DESPERATELY REQUIRED BY THE PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE SUFFERED SO BADLY 
I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WITH THE 
AMBASSADOR IN LONDON WE HAVE MADE 
IT CLEAR THAT WE WANT THE EFFORT 
GIVEN TO BURMA WE ARE WORKING HARD 
THROUGH THE AVAILABLE NETWORKS TO 
GET THE ACCESS REQUIRED 
YOU WILL BE AWARE THAT THE FRENCH 
UN HAS WANTED TO DELIVER THE ACT 
CLAUSE TO DELIVER THE AID WITHOUT 
APPROVAL DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT 
WE BELIEVE THAT THE BEST WAY 
FORWARD IS TO GET THE JUNTA TO GIVE 
US ACCESS WE HAVE BEEN MAKING 
DIRECT APPROACHES AND SPEAKING WITH 
THE 
GOVERNMENT OF 
CHINA URGING 
THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA URGING THEM THAT THERE MUST ABUNITED FRONT 
TO SAY THAT THE ACCESS MUST BE 
PROVIDED IMMEDIATALLY L. COULD HAVE 
MADE INCENDARY STATEMENTS TODAY 
BUT OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO MAKE 
SURE THAT THE SOUL FOCUS IS GETTING 
THE AID TO THE PEOPLE THAT 
IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT DO YOU AGREE 
THAT THE UN HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO 
ACT WITHOUT APPROVAL DO YOU AGREE 
I THINK THAT THE RESPONSIBLE COURSE 
IS TO WORK WITH THE BURMESE 
AUTHORITIES TO GET THE ACCESS 
REQUIRED I WAS TOLD THAT ONE OF 
THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME FLIGHTS 
HAD LANDED IN RANGOON THE FOOD WAS 
OFF LIFTED AND NOT DEDEPOS ITED 
WITH THE MILITARY BUT WAS 
DELIVERED TO THE WAREHOUSES WE 
NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE MORE 
FLIGHTS LIKE THAT ALTHOUGH IN 
TRUTH THERE ARE VERY REAL 
LOGISTICAL DIFFICULTIES TO GET THE 
PLANES ON THE GROUND 
AND THE TIMESCALE YOU ARE DEALING 
WITH THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FIVE 
DAYS WITHOUT FOOD WATER OR SHELTER 
THE FRENCH NAVY HAS A HELICOPTER 
SITTING MINUTES FROM THE DISASTER 
ZONE THEY COULD MAKE FOOD DROPS 
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE SHOT DOWN 
OUR OWN FOREIGN SECRETARY DAVID 
MILIBAND MADE AN ARTICLE THIS 
MORNING THE URGENCY OF GETTING THE 
ACCESS I CANNOT SPEAK FOR THE 
FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTRY I CAN 
ASSURE YOU WE HAVE COMMITTED THE 
LARGEST SINGLE CONTRIBUTION OF ANY 
INDIVIDUAL NATION TO THE 
HUMANITARIAN RELIEF EFFORT THERE 
WILL IS A FLASH APPEAL LAUNCHED BY 
THE UNITED NATIONS ALL OF US AS 
INDIVIDUALS COUNTRIES HAVE A ROLE 
TO PLAY 
SO YOU WOULD NOT BE IN FAVOUR OF 
HELICOPTERS OR PLANES GOING IN 
WITHOUT AUTHORISATION IN DRG 
AUTHORISATION 
I AM NOT INTERESTED AUTHORISATION IN INTERESTED IN ON FIVE DAYS ON 
DEALING WITH A DISASTER THE SCALE 
OF THE TSUNAMI AGAINST THE WISHES 
OF THE GOVERNMENT THE 
RESPONSIBILITY IS SHARED WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT OF BURMA L. HAVE MADE 
THAT POINT WITH THE BURMESE 
AMBASSADOR AMBASSADOR THERE ARE AT LEAST SEVENTEEN BRITISH 
PEOPLE MISSING IN BURMA DO YOU NOT 
HAVE DUTY TO ACT FOR THEM 
I HAVE 
SPOKEN WITH MARK CANNING THE 
BRITISH AMBASSADOR IN RANGOON HE 
MADE IT CLEAR THERE ARE A SMALL 
NUMBER OF BRITISH TRAVELLERS IN 
BURMA THEY ARE WIDELY DISPERSED 
EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO ESTABLISH 
THEIR WHEREABOUTS BUT THE 
RESPONSIBILITY COURSE IS TO ALLOW 
THE DIPLOMATS TO DO THEIR CONSULAR 
WORK AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WORK 
IS UNDER WAY FROM THE BRITISH 
EMBASSY 
THERE IS A BIG T. V. APPEAL EMBASSY UNDER WAY FOR THE MONEY BUT WHY 
SHOULD PEOPLE GIVE OVER THEIR MONEY 
IF IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE 
BURMESE AUTHORITIES WILL NOT TAKE 
IT 
I WOILD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO IT GIVE MONEY L. HAVE ADVISED TO GIVE 
PD FIVE MILLION TO THIS EFFORT L. 
ENCOURAGE FOR THE APPEAL BUT IT IS 
NOT EITHER OR WE WANT TO BE 
GENEROUS WITH THE BANK ETS THE 
MEDICINES THE WATER THE FOOD FOR 
THE PEOPLE FOR THIS INVOLVED IN 
THIS TERRIBLE TRAGEDY AND BE CLEAR 
TO THE BURMESE REAM'S AS TO ITS 
RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THE 
RELIEF IS PROVIDED TO THE PEOPLE 
THAT NEED IT L. CAN ASSURE YOUR 
VIEWERS WE ARE WORKING THE 
DIPLOMATIC AND POLITICAL TRACKS AND 
WORKING WITH THE UNITED NATIONS AND 
OTHERS TO GET THE RELIEF SUPPLIES 
TO PEOPLE THAT NEED THEM 
IF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
FAILS TO DELIVER AID THAT IS 
SUFFICIENT TO THE TASK BECAUSE OF 
THE BURPL WHYIES INTRANCE AGAINST 
WHAT THEN 
I WANT TO SEE GREATER 
ACCESS IN THE HOURS AND DAYS TO 
COME THAT IS MY EXCLUSIVE FOCUS L. 
CANNOT PREDICT WHERE WE WILL 
ANYBODY THE DAYS TO COME L. CAN 
ASSURE YOU THAT THE SOUL FOCUS OF 
THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT'S EFFORTS IS 
TO GET THE AID TO THE VICTIMS THAT 
NEED THIS HELP FIVE DAYS ON FROM 
THE CYCLONE HITTING THE COAST OF 
BURMA 
NOW AROUND THAT OF TODAY'S NEWS 
DE EXTREMIST ISLAMIC CLERIC ABU 
QATADA IS TO BE RELEASED ON BAIL 
ON THIS PROGRAMME THE FORMER 
SHADOW SECURITY SPOKESMAN PATRICK 
MERCER GAVE US HIS REACTION WE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT 
INSTRUMENTS THAT WE CAN USE TO MAKE 
SURE WE GET PROPER EVIDENCE THAT 
CAN BE USED IN COURT THAT CAN GET 
THESE PEOPLE INTO COURT AND FIND 
THEM GUILTY OR NOT FOR INSTANCE 
INTERCEPT POST CHARGE QUESTIONING 
THE THINGS ON WHICH THE GOVERNMENT 
IS DRAGGING ITS FEET 
I. T. V. HAS BEEN GIVEN A RECORD FINE BY 
OFCOM FOR ABUSING PREMIUM RATE 
PHONE SERVICES IN THE YOULA 
COMPETITIONS THE MEDIA REGULATORS 
OF THE FINE OVER FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION WAS 
BY FAR THE HIGHEST EVER IMPOSED AND 
REFLECTED THE SERIOUSNESS OF I. T. V.'S 
FAILURES AND THEIR REPEATED NATURE 
WHAT EXACTLY WAS I. T. V. DOING WRONG 
OFCOM SAYS THEY WERE MAKING MONEY 
FROM MISS CONDUCT ON MASS AUDIENCE 
PROGRAMMES PEOPLE WERE WASTING 
MONEY BECAUSE THEIR VOTES WERE NOT 
BEING COUNTED OR TAKEN ACCOUNT OF 
ON ANT AND DEC'S SATURDAY NIGHT 
TAKEAWAY PEOPLE WHO ENTERED THE 
COMPETITION COULD NOT GET THROUGH 
UNLESS THEY LIVE WITHIN ONE HOUR OF 
WHERE THE PROGRAMME WAS BEING MADE 
SO THOSE WERE TOTALLY WASTED VOTES 
ON SOAP STAR SUPERSTAR THE 
PRODUCERS OVERRULED THE VIEWER'S 
VOTE SO THE WRONG PARTICIPANTS 
WERE PUT FORWARD FOR EVICTION SO SO IS THIS ACTUALLY A LOT OF MONEY IT IT IS ALMOST THREE TIMES BIGGER THAN 
THE PREVIOUS RECORD FINE G. M. T. V. FOR 
THEIR OWN VOTES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
BIGGER IF I. T. V. HAD NOT PUT SEVEN POINT EIGHT 
MILLION THAT THEY HAD TAKEN WRONGLY 
BACK TO THE VIEWERS OR GIVEN IT TO 
CHARITY BUT IN TERMS OF THEIR 
PROFITS NOT A HUGE AMOUNT WHAT WHAT HAVE I. T. V. SAID 
THEY HAVE APOLOGISED 
AGAIN SAYING THERE HAD BEEN 
SERIOUS ERRORS THEY SAID THERE WAS 
NO CORRUPT INTENT AND THEY WERE 
TRYING 
THE 
PROGRAMME BETTER BUT THERE WERE 
ERRORS OF MISJUDGMENT AND THEY NOW 
HAVE A NEW TRAINING SCHEMES AND 
EDITORIAL COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES 
NOW THERE IS A ROW OVER THE BRITISH 
COMEDY AWARDS INVOLVING ROBBIE 
WILLIAMS 
YES WE ALREADY WILLIAMS DISCOVERED SOME WHILE AGO THAT ANT 
AND DEC'S SATURDAY NIGHT TAKEAWAY 
SHOULD NOT HAVE WON THE COMEDY 
AWARD IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE IT SHOULD HAVE GONE 
TO CATHERINE TATE WHO HAD MORE 
VIEWERS' VOTES BUT WHAT HAS 
EMERGED IS THAT ROBBIE WILLIAMS HAD 
SAID HE WOULD COME ON AND PRESENT A 
PRIZE PROVIDED IT WAS GIVEN TO ANT 
AND DEC THE LAWYERS ARE SAYING 
THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY A 
CONNECTION THAT MAY NOT BE WYVER 
WRONG PROGRAMME GOT THE VOTE BUT 
IT IS NOW BEING LOOKED AT BY OFCOM 
THIS IS AT THIS IS ALL ADDING TO 
I. T. V.'S GENERAL TRAVAILS 
IT IS I. T. V. 
IS TRYING TO FIND NEW SHAREHOLDERS 
LOSING KEY EXECUTIVES AND ITS SHARE 
PRICE IS VERY LOW 
IT IS TRYING TO 
GARNER SUPPORT FOR A CHANGE OF 
DIRECTION OBVIOUSLY IT IS THE 
WHOLE QUESTION OF REGIONAL NEWS 
SERVICES IS UP FOR DISCUSSION DO 
YOU SEE A PERIOD OF ENTRENCHMENT 
RATHER THAN THE GROWTH THAT MICHAEL 
GRADE WAS HOPING FOR 
THEY WANTED 
TO GROW THE AMOUNT OF PROGRAMMES 
THEY COULD MAKE THEMSELVES BUT 
ADVERTISING REVENUE IS GOING 
THROUGH A BAD TIME THEY ARE 
GETTING A LOWER SHARE OF THE 
ADVERTISING REVENUE IT IS HARD TO 
SEE WHERE IT GOES FROM HERE THIS 
JUST ADDS TO THE BAD NEWS THE DO 
YOU THINK MICHAEL GRADE COULD MAKE 
AN EXIT HE WILL BE THERE FOR A 
WHILE BUT HE WILL HAVE TO FIND A 
PROPER SUCCESSOR AND THAT IS 
LOOKING FURTHER AWAY AT THE MOMENT 
SUPPORTERS OF THE HEZBOLLAH LED 
OPPOSITION IN LEBANON HAVE BEEN 
INVOLVED IN ARMED CLASHES IN BEIRUT 
THE FIGHTING BEGAN AFTER THE LEADER 
OF HEZBOLLAH DESCRIBE THE 
GOVERNMENT'S MOVE TO CLOSE ITS 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK AS A 
DECLARATION OF WAR 
THE AUSTRIAN MAN ACCUSED OF 
IMPRISONING HIS DAUGHTER OF FOR TWENTY FOUR 
YEARS AND FATHERING SEVEN CHILDREN 
WITH HER HAS ADMITTED HE IS WRONG 
HE WAS WRONG AND SAID HE MUST HAVE 
BEEN CRAZY SPEAKING THROUGH HIS 
LAWYER TO A MAGAZINE JOSEF FRITZL 
SAID HE TRIED TO CARE FOR HIS 
SECRET FAMILY MEMBERS BY KEEPING 
THEM AWAY FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD 
THE MARKETS 
IN AFGHANISTAN TODAY A SUICIDE 
BOMBER KILLED FOUR PEOPLE IN TOWN 
NEAR THE PAKISTAN BORDER IT WAS 
ONE EVENT IN SERIES OF ATTACKS 
THAT CLAIMED TWELVE LIVES OVER THE PAST 
TWENTY FOUR HOURS SUICIDE BOMBINGS ARE 
OCCURRING ALMOST DAILY AND AFGHAN 
INTELLIGENCE SAYS MOST OF THE 
BOMBERS COME FROM PAKISTAN INDEED 
THREE MONTHS AFTER THE ELECTION OF 
A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IN PAKISTAN 
THE FLOW OF BOMBERS ACROSS THE 
BORDER SEEMS TO BE GETTING WORSE 
RATHER THAN BETTER MARK URBAN HAS 
BEEN TO KABUL TO FIND OUT WHY 
BUSINESS AND BUSTLE ARE GOOD THEY 
SHOW THAT AFGHANISTAN'S ECONOMY HAS 
GROWN THAT THE TALEBAN ERA OF 
ISOLATION IS WELL AND TRULY OVER 
BUT TRADE AND CROWDS NOW PROVIDE 
THE HUMAN STREAM IN WHICH THOSE 
WISHING TO DESTROY THIS COUNTRY'S 
GOVERNMENT SWIM SUICIDE BOMBING IS 
CREATING A STATE OF SIEGE HERE AND 
WE HAVE ARRANGED FOR AN INTERVIEW 
INSIDE A SECRET JAIL WE HAVE COME 
TO THIS FACILITY RUN BY THE AFGHAN 
SECURITY SERVICE THEIR VERSION OF 
M. I FIVE TO INTERVIEW SUICIDE BOMBERS 
WHO HAVE BEEN CAPTURED ALIVE WE 
ALMOST BECAME PART OF A SUICIDE 
BOMBING OURSELVES BECAUSE JUST 
FEW MOMENTS AGO AS WE WERE COMING 
UP THIS ROAD WE NOTICED A 
COMMOTION AND IN FACT A MAN IN 
SUICIDE BOMBING BEST HAD BEEN 
OVERPOWERED BY THE SECURITY STAFF 
HERE INSIDE WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE 
A GOVERNMENT SECRET FACILITY HE 
WAS ABOUT TO ASSASSINATE ONE OF THE 
SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS HERE 
AND WE VERY NEARLY GOT CAUGHT UP IN 
IT THIS WAS THE MAN WE INTENDED TO 
MEET MOHAMMED RAMADAN ONE OF 
THREE MEN WHO ATTACKED A HOTEL IN 
JANUARY KILLING EIGHT PEOPLE FOR 
SOME REASON HE DID NOT DETONATE 
HIS BOMB BEST VEST 
THERE WAS A 
PERSON FROM THE TALEBAN ARE INVITED 
ME TO WAGE JIHAD IN AFGHANISTAN L. 
MET A COMMANDER AND HE HAD A PERSON 
WHO WORKED IN AFGHANISTAN AND I 
CAME HERE WITH HIM 
WHEN THEY SEND 
YOU TO THE HOTEL WHAT WAS YOUR 
MISSION SIMPLY TO KILL AS MANY 
FOREIGNERS AS POSSIBLE WHAT WERE 
YOUR ORDERS WHAT WERE YOU TOLD TO 
DO DO WE WERE TOLD THAT 
FOREIGNERS WERE LIVING IN THAT 
HOTEL THAT THEY WERE FOREIGNERS 
DO YOU REGRET IT 
I WAS TOLD A LIE 
NOW I SEE THE PEOPLE HERE ARE 
MUSLIM 
SHAKI RULLAH IS JUST FOURTEEN MUSLIM YEARS OLD HE WAS CAPTURED EARLY IN 
APRIL IN A CAR FULL OF HIGH 
EXPLOSIVE WHICH HE WAS SUPPOSED TO 
DRIVE INTO A CROWDED BAZAAR 
I WAS LEARNING IN A 
MADRASAH OR WHEN I FINISHED 
READING THE KORAN I WAS TOLD TO GO 
I CRIED SAYING I DON'T WANT TO GO 
BUT THEY TOLD ME I HAD FINISHED THE 
KORAN AND I HAD 
TO GO WAS TAKEN TO KHOST AND TOLD HER WAS A 
SUICIDE BOMBER 
DID YOU GET A 
CHANCE TO TELL YOUR PARENTS YOU 
WERE GOING TO MAKE JIHAD ORDERED 
THE PEOPLE IN THE MADRASAH TAKE YOU 
AWAY WITHOUT A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO 
THEM THEM I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO 
SEE MY PARENTS THEY DID NOT KNOW 
WHAT I WAS DOING 
WHAT WOULD YOU 
SAY TO YOUR PARENTS NOW IF YOU 
COULD SPEAK TO THEM 
I WOULD TELL 
THEM I DID A VERY BAD THING BOTH BOTH THESE MEN ARE FROM PAKISTAN'S 
TRIBAL AREAS ON THE BORDER AND 
WHILE THERE ARE FAILED AFGHAN 
SUICIDE BOMBERS HERE TOO THE 
MAJORITY COME FROM PAKISTAN AND THE 
NUMBERS HAVE BEEN RISING AS THE 
TALEBAN RATCHET UP MASS CASUALTY 
TERRORISM 
THESE ARE DEVASTATING TERRORISM EVENTS THEY ARE NOT DIRECTION OFF 
THEY ARE OMNI DIRECTION OF SO THE 
COLLATERAL DAMAGE IS WIDE AND WHAT 
IT DOES TO INNOCENT CIVILIANS THE 
BEST WAY TO CATEGORISE IT IS 
BARBARIC 
PAKISTAN THE MAIN BARBARIC GATEWAY TO KABUL THE SKYBET AGENCY 
ONE OF THE TRIBAL AREAS 
IT HAS BECOME SO DANGEROUS THAT WE 
WERE GIVEN A SIX MAN POLICE ESCORT 
FOR FILMING MOST OF THE PEOPLE 
LIVING IN THE TRIBAL AREAS ARE HAVE 
OUR ETHNIC AFGHANS TO MOVE ACROSS 
THE BORDER AS IF IT WAS NOT THERE 
OATH OATH THE TRIBAL AREAS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A 
SEMI DETACHED PART OF PAKISTAN 
UNDER LIMITED CONTROL BY THE 
AUTHORITIES AND JEALOUSLY GUARDING 
VARIOUS RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES ONE 
OF THE CUSTOMS THEY HOLD MOST DEAR 
IS THAT OF SANCTUARY GIVING REFUGE 
TO PEOPLE WHO THEY CONSIDER WORTHY 
THAT IS WHAT HAS MADE IT VERY HARD 
IN RECENT YEARS TO CLAMP DOWN ON 
AFGHAN TALEBAN WHO TAKE REFUGE 
AMONG THE PEOPLE THERE THREE 
MONTHS AGO A NEW GOVERNMENT WAS 
ELECTED IN PAKISTAN THE WINNING 
PARTIES HAVE EMPHASISED A NEED FOR 
DIALOGUE WITH MILITANT GROUPS IN 
THE TRIBAL AREAS AND AFTER TWO 
YEARS OF FIGHTING IN THOSE 
MOUNTAINS MANY PAKISTANIS WANT TO 
DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THE 
AMERICAN WAR ON TERROR 
I HOPE THE 
PAKISTAN GOVERNMENT WILL NOT TELL 
THE AMERICANS WHERE TO GET OFF L. 
THINK WE HAVE DONE MORE THAN OUR 
SHARE ALONG THE BORDER NATO HAS 
MORE TECHNOLOGICAL ABILITY AS DO 
THE AMERICANS THEY NEED TO DO MORE 
ABOUT THE BORDER WHEN WE CLOSE THE 
BORDER TO STOP SMUGGLING IT IS MR. 
KARZAI WHO STARTS GETTING 
HYSTERICAL SO YES WE HAVE TO 
FIGHT TERRORISM BUT THE GOVERNMENT 
WILL HAVE TO DO IT TAKING INTO 
CONSIDERATION THE CROWD REALITIES 
AND WHAT OUR NEEDS ARE IN PAKISTAN 
PAKISTANI AFGHAN TENSIONS BEDEVIL 
THE EFFORT TO IMPROVE SECURITY 
PAKISTANI LEADERS WOULD LIKE TO 
BULLDOZE THE PROBLEM JUST LIKE 
THIS SOVIET ERA AFGHAN REFUGEE CAMP 
NEAR PESHAWAR THE DANGER IS THAT 
NEW ATTEMPTS TO DEAL POLITICALLY 
HERE WILL SIMPLY SHUNT THE 
MILITANTS ACROSS THE BORDER 
BRITISH TROOPS IN HELMAND 
MEANWHILE HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHAT 
THEY CALL AN EXTERNALLY SUPPORTED 
INSURGENCY THEY HAVE COME UNDER 
ATTACK FROM PAKISTANI SUICIDE 
BOMBERS AND SOME AFGHAN 
INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE EVEN CLAIM MOST 
OF THE FIGHTERS IN HELMAND ARE 
PAKISTANI DOWN ON THE DUSTY 
STREETS AGENTS BRING THEIR 
HANDLERS THE LATEST GOSSIP AND 
TALES OF ORDERS EMANATING FROM 
TALEBAN LEADERS IN PAKISTAN THE 
SO CALLED BUT PROVING THE LYNX 
IS FAR FROM EASY 
IT CERTAINLY 
EXISTS BECAUSE WE HEAR A LOT OF 
TALK ABOUT IT PEOPLE WILL TALK 
ABOUT IT OCCASIONALLY WE GET 
REPORTING FROM OTHER SOURCES THAT 
THEY HAVE SAID ONE THING OR ANOTHER 
AND WE SEE EVIDENCE THAT GROUPS 
THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE VERY 
DESPERATE FROM DIFFERENT AREAS 
WILL COME TOGETHER AND WORK 
TOGETHER THAT SEEMS TO BE BECAUSE 
OF OUTSIDE DIRECTION 
THIS SUMMER 
HUNDREDS OF U. S. MARINES HAVE JOINED 
THE FIGHT IN HELMAND TRYING TO 
STOP INFILTRATION ACROSS THE DESERT 
BORDER BUT EVEN A GROWING NATO 
PRESENCE HAS NOT SOLVED THE PROBLEM 
SECURING A BORDER SO LONG WITH THE 
AMOUNT OF FORCES AND THE AMOUNT OF 
TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES WHICH WE 
HAVE IT IS ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE 
THE U. S. BORDER IN THE SOUTH WITH 
ALL ITS MIGHT CANNOT BE SECURED 
SO MANY PEOPLE CROSS THE BORDER BY 
A MARKED ROUTES THAT THE 
AUTHORITIES TRY TO INTERCEPT THEM 
AT THE GATES OF KABUL BY 
UNMARKED ROOTS A VEILED FEMALE 
OFFICER IS ON HAND TO SEARCH TOO 
NEARBY SCORES OF TRUCKS WAIT TO 
MAKE THE JOURNEY BACK DOWN TO 
PAKISTAN WHAT PROPORTION COME 
UNDER OFFICIAL SCRUTINY HERE IN 
THIS JOINT INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS 
CENTRE THEY ARE TRYING TO RAISE 
THEIR GAME IT HAS NEVER BEEN 
FILMED BEFORE BECAUSE OF THE 
SENSITIVITIES OF HAVING PAKISTANI 
OFFICERS IN KABUL EXCHANGING 
INFORMATION 
THEY ARE SIX PAKISTAN INFORMATION OFFICERS AND SIX AFGHAN OFFICERS 
AND ABOUT SIX INTERNATIONAL 
SECURITY FORCE OFFICERS EVERY DAY 
THEY COME TO WORK IN THE SAME AREA 
OF THIS COMPOUND AND WORK THROUGH 
ISSUES THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR BETTER 
CO ORDINATION BETWEEN THE PAKISTAN 
MILITARY AND THE AFGHAN MILITARY 
IT IS A CURIOUS FEATURE THOUGH OF 
THE AFGHAN PAKISTANI RELATIONSHIP 
THAT ATTEMPTS LIKE THIS TO CO 
OPERATE OFTEN REMAIN SECRET WHILE 
WHEN THERE ARE PROBLEMS LIKE THE 
RECENT ATTEMPT ON THE LIFE OF 
PRESIDENT HAMID KARZAI ACCUSATIONS 
FLY A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER TWO M. P.'S 
WERE KILLED IN THIS INCIDENT THE 
HEAD OF AFGHAN INTELLIGENT REMARK 
THAT THE COUNTRY ONCE AGAIN HAD 
BEEN ATTACKED BY PAKISTAN BASED 
MILITANTS MILITANTS IN THE CALMER SURROUNDINGS OF THE 
LAKE WEST OF KABUL THE FRIDAY 
CROWD ENJOYED A DAY OFF IN SPRING 
WEATHER MUCH HAS CHANGED IN THIS 
CITY SINCE THE TALEBAN FELL NOT 
LEAST IN THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
ENJOYING YOURSELF AMONG PEOPLE 
HERE WE FOUND A WIDESPREAD VIEW 
THAT THE NEW PAKISTAN GOVERNMENT 
LIKE THE OLD ONE IS NOT DOING 
ENOUGH 
THEY ARE JUST THINKING ENOUGH ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF THEIR OWN 
MOST OF THE TALEBAN ARE NOT FROM 
AFGHANISTAN MOST OF THEM ARE 
PAKISTANIS THEY ARE DIRECTLY BEING 
SUPPORTED BY PAKISTAN THE 
GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN NEVER THINKS 
ABOUT THIS THAT THEY SHOULD ARREST 
THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE A POWER OF 
PAKISTAN 
DOWN IN THE CITY A PAKISTAN GROWING NERVOUSNESS ABOUT SECURITY 
TESTIFY AS TO THE LACK OF PROGRESS 
ON THE BORDER INTELLIGENCE 
OFFICERS HAVE TOLD US THAT THEY 
HAVE ALREADY DETECTED SOME DECREASE 
IN MILITANT ACTIVITY IN PAKISTAN 
SINCE THE ELECTIONS THE QUESTION 
NOW IS WHETHER THOSE EXTREMISTS 
WILL SWITCH MORE AND MORE OF THEIR 
EFFORTS TO AFGHANISTAN AND THE 
FIGHT AGAINST NATO HERE MAKING IT 
EVEN MORE DANGEROUS FOR WESTERN 
TROOPS IN THIS COUNTRY BACK IN THE 
INTERROGATION CELL I ASKED THE TWO 
SURVIVING SUICIDE ATTACKERS WHAT 
COULD BE DONE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE WHO TOOK YOU IN 
THE MADRASAH DID NOT EVEN LET YOU 
SPEAK TO YOUR PARENTS 
IT IS BAD THING 
THEY LIED TO US 
IT WOULD BE BETTER 
TO CAPTURE THESE PEOPLE AND PUT 
THEM IN JAIL BUT HOW 
BUT THE 
PRESENCE OF FOREIGN TROOPS REMAINS 
A POTENT RECRUITING 
JIHAD AND EVEN A JAIL TALLIED WITH 
NOT REPUDIATED TALEBAN 
I THINK IF MUSLIMS ARE 
IN DIFFICULTIES AND DOING SOMETHING 
BAD AGAINST MUSLIMS THEN SHE HAD 
IS ALLOWED 
KABUL REMAINS AN OPEN 
CITY DESPITE THE THREAT POOR 
RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN AND THE 
NATURE OF THE BORDER ITSELF MAKE 
QUICK FIXES IMPOSSIBLE INSTEAD 
THE AUTHORITIES HOPE THAT PUBLIC 
REVULSION WITH SUICIDE BOMBING WILL 
TURN OPINION AROUND ALLOWING THE 
INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE TO THWART THE 
BOMBERS BOMBERS IN THE THIRD FILM IN OUR SERIES OF 
REPORTS FROM AFGHANISTAN IT WILL 
BE ON NEWSNIGHT SOON WE HAVE BEEN 
GIVEN EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO THE FRONT 
LINE TEAM AIMING TO PREVENT POST 
TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER 
SOMETHING WHICH HAS AFFECTED AROUND 
SIXTY THOUSAND TROOPS SINCE THE WAR ON 
TERROR BEGAN 
THIS KID CAME IN WITH 
A BULLET WOUND IN HIS HEAD AS I 
WAS ADJUSTING HIS BANDAGES MY HAND 
WENT INTO HIS BRAIN THERE WAS 
ANOTHER ONE THAT CAME IN AND I WAS 
TRYING TO ADJUST HIS BANDAGES AND 
BY HAND WENT INTO HIS LIVER 
TOMORROW MORNING'S FRONT PAGES WE 
BEGIN WITH THE SUN 
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER STORY INSIDE 
THE SUN AND DAVID GROSSMAN IS HERE 
TO TELL US ABOUT IT 
IT IS A POLE 
AND IT MAKES DEVASTATINGLY BAD 
READING FOR THE LABOUR PARTY THE 
FIGURES ARE LABOUR ON TWENTY THREE PER CENT THE 
CONSERVATIVES FORTY NINE PER CENT AND THE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS ON SEVENTEEN PER CENT THE SUN SAYS THAT 
IS THE LOWEST EVER SHARE OF THE 
VOTE FOR LABOUR SINCE POLLING BEGAN 
IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AND THE SECOND 
BIGGEST EVER CONSERVATIVE LEAD 
SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT IF THERE WAS A GENERAL 
ELECTION TOMORROW THAT WOULD BE BAD 
NEWS FOR THE LABOUR PARTY BUT IN 
TWO WEEKS THERE IS THE CREWE AND 
NANTWICH BY ELECTION WHICH LABOUR 
WERE LOOKING TO HOLD ON TO IT WAS 
THE SEAT THEY HELD UNTIL THE DEATH 
OF GWYNETH DUNWOODY ON THE BASIS 
OF THIS YOU HAVE TO SAVE THE 
CONSERVATIVES LOOK FAVOURITES FOR 
THAT 
CAN LABOUR CLUTCH AT THE FACT THAT THAT THIS COULD BE A ROGUE POLL 
THERE IS ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY THIS 
IS BY A POLLING ORGANISATION THAT 
DOES THINGS DIFFERENTLY TO OTHER 
POLLING ORGANISATIONS TECHNICALLY 
THEY DO SURVEY RATHER THAN A POLL 
THEY CONTACT PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET 
HAVING SAID THAT THEY HAVE COME UP 
WITH BIG LEAGUES FOR THE LABOUR 
PARTY IN THE RECENT PAST AND IN 
THE VERY RECENT PAST LAST WEEK 
THEIR SURVEY THE DAY BEFORE THEY 
VOTED ON THE LONDON MAYORAL CONTEST 
WAS PRETTY MUCH SPOT ON 
SO NO GOOD 
NEWS FOR GORDON BROWN 
ONE OF THE 
OTHER POLLING QUESTIONS WAS WHETHER 
YOU WOULD BE MORE OR LESS LIKELY TO 
VOTE LABOUR WITH A DIFFERENT LEADER 
AND THEY GAVE PEOPLE A SET OF 
DIFFERENT LEADERS NONE OF THEM 
CAME UP AS POPULAR AS GORDON BROWN 
AND SOME WERE EVEN TEN POINTS DOWN 
ON HIM THAT SUGGESTS PEOPLE ARE 
UPSET NOT JUST WITH HIM BUT WITH 
LABOUR GENERALLY 
THE GUARDIAN HAS THE I. T. V. STORY THAT 
ROBBIE WILLIAMS ALLEGEDLY SAID HE 
WOULD COME ON TO PRESENT AWARDS IF 
ANT AND DEC WON 
AT THE BOTTOM THE U. S. MAY IGNORE 
JUNTA AND AIRLIFT BURMA AID 
IN THE INDEPENDENT 
ON THE RIGHT THE I. M. F. WARNS OF 
INFLATION THREAT TO THE WORLD'S 
ECONOMY ECONOMY THAT IS ALL FROM NEWSNIGHT YOU CAN
