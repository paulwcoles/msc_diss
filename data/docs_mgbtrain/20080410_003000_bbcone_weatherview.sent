DAD DAD 
WAKING THE DEAD RETURNS NO 
ON WEDNESDAY A FEW SHOWERS ACROSS CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PARTS OF THE U. K. 
THEY'LL FADE OVERNIGHT BUT I SUSPECT THEY'LL BE BACK TOMORROW 
A TYPICAL APRIL DAY REALLY 
A DAY OF SUNSHINE AND SOME SHOWERS 
IT'S THIS LARGE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE JUST TO THE SOUTH OF ICELAND 
WHICH IS DRIVING OUR WEATHER IT'LL STICK AROUND RIGHT INTO THE WEEKEND 
KEEPING THINGS FAIRLY UNSETTLED 
WE'LL SEE THE FIRST ARM OF THAT AREA OF LOW PRESSURE 
BRINGING SOME CLOUD AND OUTBREAKS OF RAIN INTO MORE WESTERN PARTS 
OF THE U. K. OVERNIGHT FURTHER EAST CLEAR SKIES AND IT'LL TURN COLD 
TOWNS AND CITIES DOWN TO TWO OR THREE DEGREES BUT IT'LL BE LOWER THAN THAT 
IN RURAL SPOTS AND A TOUCH OF FROST ON THE GROUND BY DAWN 
IN THE MORNING QUITE A FEW SHOWERS ACROSS CENTRAL AND WESTERN WALES 
FOR NORTHERN IRELAND SOMETHING OF A DRIER BRIGHTER INTERLUDE 
EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING SPELLS OF SUNSHINE HERE 
BUT SHOWERS OUT TO THE WEST NOT FAR AWAY 
IN WESTERN SCOTLAND SOME SHOWERS AT LOWER LEVELS UP ON THE HILLS 
A LITTLE SLEET AND SNOW 
IT SHOULDN'T AMOUNT TO MUCH AND SHOULDN'T LAST LONG 
ONE OR TWO SHOWERS EARLY ON FOR SOUTHERN AND EASTERN SCOTLAND 
AND THE ODD ONE INTO NORTHERN ENGLAND 
BUT MUCH OF YORKSHIRE LINCOLNSHIRE EAST ANGLIA AND THE SOUTHEAST 
MUCH OF THE MIDLAND CLEAR SKIES OVERNIGHT AND SUNSHINE FIRST THING 
A LOVELY START AND PLENTY OF BLUE SKY BUT IT WILL BE ON THE CHILLY SIDE 
THICKER CLOUD FOR CORNWALL AND DEVON THROUGH THE MORNING 
BRINGING ONE OR TWO SHOWERS BUT ALL IN ALL DURING THE DAY ON THURSDAY 
THAT BAND OF SHOWERS WILL PUSH A LITTLE BIT FURTHER INLAND 
WITH THE APRIL SUNSHINE GETTING TO WORK 
THOSE SHOWERS COULD TURN OUT TO BE ON THE SHARP SIDE FOR THE AFTERNOON 
TOWARDS THE SOUTHEAST SHOWERS FEW AND FAR BETWEEN 
GOOD SPELLS OF SUNSHINE IN LONDON FOURTEEN DEGREES 
A NOTCH OR TWO UP ON WHAT WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY 
THE MIDLANDS AFTER A LOVELY START WILL SEE SHOWERS IN THE AFTERNOON 
UP OVER THE PENNINES THOSE SHOWERS COULD BE A BIT WINTRY 
BUT IT SHOULDN'T AMOUNT TO MUCH 
SCATTERED SHOWERS ACROSS A FAIRLY CLOUDY SCOTLAND 
EIGHT DEGREES IN GLASGOW 
MAYBE NINE IN BELFAST AND A GOOD DEAL OF CLOUD FOR THE AFTERNOON 
A LITTLE BIT OF BRIGHTNESS BUT EQUALLY ONE OR TWO SHOWERS 
ACROSS WALES THOSE SHOWERS WILL SPREAD THEIR WAY FROM WEST TO EAST 
THERE COULD BE SOME HEAVY BURSTS RUMBLES OF THUNDER ARE FORECAST 
SOME HAIL AS WELL MIXED IN 
QUITE HEAVY SHOWERS ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND 
RUMBLES OF THUNDER AND SOME HAIL MIXED IN 
ON THURSDAY EVENING MANY SHOWERS WILL FADE FOR A TIME 
BUT WE WILL SEE SOME WETTER WEATHER 
ACROSS EASTERN ENGLAND AND EASTERN SCOTLAND AGAIN 
SOME SNOW FOR THE GRAMPIANS MORE SHOWERS GATHERING OUT WEST 
THAT BRINGS US INTO FRIDAY LOW PRESSURE IN CHARGE OF THE WEATHER 
IT'LL BE AN UNSETTLED DAY BREEZIER WITH SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS 
AND ONCE AGAIN SOME OF THOSE SHOWERS 
ON THE SHARP SIDE 
LOW PRESSURE STAYS IN CHARGE 
AS WE GO THROUGH THE WEEKEND 
THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE U. K.
