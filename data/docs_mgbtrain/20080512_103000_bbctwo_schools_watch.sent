I HOPE SO ME TOO 
MUM MAKE SURE YOU GET LOTS OF SHOTS OF ALL OF THESE FLOWERS 
AND THE TREES AND THE WHOLE PARK 
OH IT'S FANTASTIC 
LOOK LOOK FOR YOU ONE YELLOW PLANT 
THANK YOU BARNABY THE PARK WAS REALLY DIFFERENT TWO YEARS AGO 
I KNOW YES IT WAS REALLY SCRUFFY NOT NOW THOUGH 
THERE WAS LOTS OF GRAFFITI BROKEN FENCES AND DOG MESS 
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED NEARBY DIDN'T WANT TO USE IT 
AND THERE WAS NOWHERE 
THEN THE LOCAL RESIDENTS DECIDED TO GET TOGETHER AND CHANGE IT 
THEY ASKED OUR SCHOOL TO HELP THEM 
EVERYONE WAS VERY EXCITED 
AND YOUR CLASS HAD LOADS OF GOOD IDEAS DIDN'T THEY ANISA YES 
WE DID A PROJECT ON THE PARK AND CALLED IT PLANNING FOR REAL HMM 
DID YOU ENJOY DOING THAT TOO KATHERINE 
YES IT WAS GREAT FUN MAKING ALL THE PLANS AND MODELS 
WE MADE A MODEL OF THE PARK AS IT WAS 
THE MODEL HELPED US TO SEE THE SHAPE AND SPACE IN THE PARK 
AND THEN THE CLASS DREW A PLAN 
AND CHOSE THINGS THEY WANTED TO PUT IN THE PARK 
SHALL WE HAVE FROGS SOME PEOPLE ARE SCARED OF FROGS A LITTLE KIOSK 
SELLING ICE CREAM AND HOT CHOCOLATE 
WE HAD TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT OUR CHOICES' 
PICNIC TABLES DEFINITELY 
I THINK DUSTBINS DEFINITELY 
BECAUSE DUSTBINS YEAH FOR DOGS AS WELL 
LITTLE RED BINS FOR DOGS' MESS 
AND THE DUSTBINS FOR PEOPLE TO THROW THEIR RUBBISH IN 
BECAUSE THEY'LL KEEP ON DROPPING IT ON THE FLOOR WITHOUT DUSTBINS 
WHAT ABOUT FLOWERS 
NEXT TO THE PICNIC TABLES 
AND AS PEOPLE EAT THEIR FOOD THEY COULD LOOK AT THE FLOWERS YEAH 
C. C. T. V. THAT'S A BIT OVER THE TOP THOUGH 
THE FENCES IS NOT A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PRISON OR ANYTHING 
DISABLED ACCESS THERE COULD BE GRAVEL BUT PRESSED 
YEAH FLATTENED SO THAT THE PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS COULD GET AROUND 
LET'S LEAVE IT LIKE THAT FOR A SECOND 
PLAY AREA SLIDES FOR THE KIDS TO PLAY ON 
IT MIGHT BE A BIT BORING FOR THEM 
WE PUT ALL OUR IDEAS ON A DISPLAY BOARD 
AND WE SENT IT TO THE LOCAL RESIDENTS' ASSOCIATION 
OH HELLO JOSHUA 
YOU'VE NEARLY FINISHED ALL YOUR PLANTING 
WERE YOU PLEASED WHEN THE LOCAL PEOPLE SAID THEY LIKED YOUR PLANS 
YEAH IT WAS GREAT HAVING A SAY IN HOW IT WOULD LOOK YEAH 
AND IT WAS GREAT WHEN THE DESIGNER LOOKED AT YOUR PLANS FIRST 
WERE YOU EXCITED JOSHUA 
YES SHE SAID THEY HELPED HER TO DESIGN THE NEW PARK 
IT TOOK LOTS OF TIME TO CLEAR THE PARK 
AND PUT IN ALL THE NEW FURNITURE AND PLANTS 
THE BUILDERS AND LOCAL PEOPLE ALL WORKED TOGETHER 
AND TODAY IT'S FINALLY FINISHED IT LOOKS FANTASTIC DOESN'T IT 
MUM YOU'D BETTER GET LOTS OF LOVELY SHOTS OF THE PARK 
BEFORE WE LET EVERYONE IN 
OH 
LOOK AT OUR PARK WHERE THE CHILDREN GO 
OH I CAN FEEL THE GRASS TICKLING BETWEEN MY TOES 
DON'T LITTER IT GRAFFITI IT OR TRAMPLE ON THE FLOWERS 
WALK IN IT SIT IN IT EVEN TAKE A PICNIC IN IT 
WE'LL BE HAPPY FOR HOURS AND HOURS 
IF EVERYONE DID WHAT WE ALL WANT TO DO 
WE COULD KEEP THIS PLACE LOOKING BRAND NEW 
IT'S SUCH A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE TO PUT PAPER IN A BIN 
AND LEAVE ONLY FOOTPRINTS WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN 
HERE IN OUR PARK IT JUST FEELS SO FINE 
WE COME EVERY DAY COME RAIN OR SHINE 
IT'S THE BEAUTIFULLEST RESTFULLEST PLACE TO RELAX 
WE CAN PLAY IN IT READ IN IT 
EVEN WALK A DOG IN IT 
KICK OFF OUR SHOES AND LIE FLAT ON OUR BACKS 
OH 
IT'S A GREAT PARK ISN'T IT MUM 
OH WHAT A LOVELY DAY
