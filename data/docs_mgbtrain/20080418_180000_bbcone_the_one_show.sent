HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE ONE SHOW 
WITH ADRIAN CHILES 
AND CHRISTINE 
BLEAKLEY JOINING US ANGELLICA BELL 
AND LUCY SIEGLE 
AND A BRITISH 
SCREEN LEGEND THE MAN BEHIND 
CLASSICS LIKE ABIGAIL'S PARTY 
SECRETS AND LIES 
MIKE LEIGH 
LOVELY TO HAVE YOU HERE 
IT'S GREAT 
TO BE HERE 
HIS TROPHY CABINET IS 
VERY FULL INDEED WE LOOK FORWARD 
TO TALKING TO YOU SHORTLY FIRST 
TIMES MIGHT BE TOUGH FOR MANY 
FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES OUT THERE 
BUT TESCO SEEMS UNTOUCHED BY ANY OF 
THAT REALITY PROFITS UP A RECORD 
TWELVE PER CENT ONE IN EVERY SEVEN WE SPEND AT 
THE SHOPS GOES TO BRITAIN'S BIGGEST 
SUPERMARKET 
EVERY LITTLE HELPS AS SUPERMARKET THEY SAY 
IT CERTAINLY HELPS TESCO 
BUT MILLIONS OF US GET GRUMPY AT 
THE MENTION OF TESCO'S NAME 
PLAINLY MILLIONS OF US STILL SHOP 
THERE 
HARROGATE IS ONE OF THE LAST THERE PLACES WITHOUT A TESCO SUPERSTORE 
IN BRITAIN 
MORE THAN A FEW THERE 
DON'T WANT THAT TO CHANGE 
MORE COMPETITION AND THAT SHOULD 
MEAN CHEAPER GROCERIES SURELY 
THERE WILL BE SUPPORT FOR A NEW 
TESCO HERE IN HARROGATE ANDREW 
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR SHOP WE WE SPECIALISE IN SELLING A LOT OF 
LOCAL 
ALL THE MEAT YOU CAN 
SEE IS ALL SOURCED IN A THIRTY MILE 
RADIUS 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON OF TESCO RADIUS OPENING UP THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE 
DOWN THE ROAD 
WITH THAT SHEER 
SCALE COMES A LOT OF 
RESPONSIBILITIES AND I DON'T THINK 
TESCO LIVE UP TO THOSE 
RESPONSIBILITIES IN TERMS OF THE 
WAY THEY SOURCE THEIR FOOD AND THE 
WAY THEY TREAT THEIR SUPPLIERS 
THEY'VE OPENED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY STORES IN THE U. K. 
ALREADY THIS YEAR ALONE AND THEY 
DON'T NEED ONE IN EVERY POSTCODE I I HAVE TO SAY I MEAN TESCO'S PRICES 
ARE IMPRESSIVES SAUCE TWENTY SIX P. 
TOOTHPASTE ABOUT FIFTY P. 
YOU TAKE THE 
QUALITY PRODUCT WE SELL HERE AND 
BUY THAT PRODUCT IN ONE OF THE 
SUPERMARKETS YOU WILL PAY EVERY BIT 
AS MUCH AS YOU DO HERE IT'S NOT 
JUST ME AS A LOCAL FOOD RETAILER 
THAT OUGHT TO BE WORRIED WE WILL 
BECOME ANOTHER GHOST TOWN AND THERE 
ARE TOO MANY OF THOSE IN BRITAIN 
ALREADY ALREADY WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE SITE THE THE SITE IS TOO CLOSE TO THE MAIN 
JUNCTION OF TWO MAJOR ROADS FORTY FOUR PER CENT 
OF IT WILL BE NON FOOD RETAILING 
AND IT WILL DAMAGE THE OTHER AREAS 
OF OUR TOWN AND THE TOWN INTEREST 
BECAUSE IT WILL BE IN DIRECT 
COMPETITION WITH THEM 
ARE YOU 
ANIMBY 
IT'S NOT IN MY BACKYARD I ANIMBY DON'T LIVE THIS CLOSE TO IT AND I 
DON'T MIND PEOPLE HAVING TESCO BUT 
NOT ON THIS PARTICULAR SITE WE WE ASKED TESCO FOR AN INTERVIEW THEY 
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO APPEAR ON THE 
PROGRAMME BUT GAVE US THIS 
STATEMENT 
SO SOME LOCAL RESIDENTS OPPOSE IT 
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT 
TESCO ARE AFTER THE HARROGATE 
SHOPPERS SHOPPERS GO ON TAKE THEIR BREAD 
I PREFER 
THICK SLICE 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH L. I DON'T WANT ANYTHING 
YOU DON'T WANT 
ANY OF THESE LOVELY TESCO GOODS NO NO YOU WANT A TESCO HERE 
CAN'T BUILD 
ONE FAST ENOUGH THERE IS STILL 
SAINSBURY'S MORRISONS WHY CAN'T 
TESCO BE HERE 
THE SHOPS GETTING 
MADE THERE IF IT WAS GOING TO BE 
BUILT SOMEWHERE ELSE THEY WOULDN'T 
BE BOTHERED 
WILL YOU BE 
PROTESTING 
I WOULD YEAH PEOPLE PROTESTING PEOPLE HAVE CHOICE THEY DON'T HAVE TO 
STOP AT TESCO BECAUSE IT'S HAVE 
TO SHOP AT TESCO BECAUSE IT'S THERE 
IF THEY DON'T LIKE THE THOUGHT OF 
THEM BEING THEN THEY DON'T HAVE 
TO GO THERE 
WELL ACCORDING TO THE ONE SHOW'S 
THOROUGHLY UNSCIENTIFIC SURVEY IT 
SEEMS A FEW PEOPLE IN HARROGATE 
WOULD LIKE THE NEW SUPERSTORE SO 
WHAT EVER THE OPPONENTS SAY TESCO 
MAY BE COMING TO TOWN 
MIKE WHAT ARE YOUR INSTINCTS ON 
THIS ONE THE COMING OF A BIG 
SUPERSTORE 
THE THING IS WHAT IS SUPERSTORE WRONG WITH ALL SUPERSTORES IS WHEN 
YOU GET THIS TERRIBLE 
HOMOGENISATION OF EVERYWHERE AND 
LITTLE SHOPS THAT HAVE THEIR 
INDIVIDUAL PERSONALITY GO OUT OF 
BUSINESS THERE IS A SEPARATE 
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD 
BE BASHING TESCO OR SAINSBURY'S OR 
ANYBODY ELSE THAT'S REALLY MY MAIN 
FEELING 
WHEN YOU TRAVEL AROUND THE FEELING COUNTRY IN VARIOUS TOWNS YOU NOTICE 
EVERYWHERE LOOKS THE SAME 
YEAH AND 
IT'S TERRIBLE L. L. ACTUALLY WE ALL 
KNOW BUTCHERS AND FISHMONGERS AND 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE OUT OF 
BUSINESS BECAUSE OF THE BIG 
SUPERMARKETS AND THAT'S TERRIBLE 
YOU HAVE BEEN FILMING ALL DAY TWELVE 
HOUR DAYS YOU ARE HUNGRY YOU GET 
HOME THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR TESCO IS OPEN YOU 
ARE NOT GOING TO SAY NO 
THE FIRST 
TIME I WENT TO ONE OF THESE TESCO 
SUPERSTORES WAS ABOUT TWO MONTHS 
AGO MY FRIEND TOOK ME AND I WENT 
ALSO LAST WEEK WITH ANOTHER FRIEND 
AND IT'S LIKE A SWEETIE STORE YOU 
CAN GET D. V. D. S. C. D.'S YOU CAN BUY A 
TELEVISION GET SOCKS WHATEVER YOU 
WANT 
OTHER SUPERSTORES ARE WANT AVAILABLE BY THE WAY YOU ARE AFTER 
THE ADVERTISING CONTRACT OR 
SOMETHING 
A BIT OF MODELLING SOMETHING WHATEVER I LOVED IT 
LUCY WILL RUN 
A KNIFE THROUGH YOUR SHOULDER BLADE 
WELL IT'S JUST PROBABLY HAS GOT 
NOVELTY VALUE IF YOU DON'T NORMALLY 
GO BUT IT'S ALSO NOT ONLY HAVE THE 
BIG FOUR ALL THE SUPERMARKETS 
CHANNELLED EVERYTHING ALL THE 
BUYING POWER BUT THEY'RE NOW 
MOVING INTO THE NON FOOD RETAIL AND 
THAT WORRIES ME BECAUSE THEY'VE 
MASSIVE POWER 
WHERE DO THEY STOP 
ONE IN SEVEN IS SPENT AT TESCO WHEN 
THEY WILL BE SATISFIED ONE IN 
FIVE 
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE FIVE GOING TO STOP AND THAT'S UNHEALTHY 
AS BUSINESS PEOPLE THEY'RE 
EXCELLENT AT IT WE HAVE AN E. MAIL 
FROM JOHNY IN HARROGATE IT'S A 
WELL ARGUED POINT OF VIEW I WOULD 
SUGGEST IT'S THE SELF INTERESTED 
LOCAL BUSINESSES WHO SHOUT LOUD BUT 
HAVE NO ACTUAL MANDATE TO REPRESENT 
THE REST OF US THE CURRENT SITE IS 
A DERELICT WASTELAND TESCO WOULD 
BRING JOBS COMPETITION AND CHOICE 
TO THE TOWN CHRISTINE IS WELL FIT 
COMPLETELY UNDERMINED HIMSELF 
THANKS VERY MUCH 
WHAT WAS HIS 
POINT AGAIN 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
CHARMING WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
JOHNY AT LEAST SOMEONE APPRECIATES 
ME ONE THING YOU COULD SOON SEE ON 
YOUR SUPERMARKET FISH COUNTERIS 
CARP 
SOME TYPES OF FISH COULD BE CARP TRAWLED TO EXTINCTION IF WE ARE NOT 
CAREFUL SO THE HUNT IS ON FOR A 
MORE SUSTAINABLE SPECIES LUCY HAS 
BEEN TO DEVON TO MEET A COUPLE VERY 
KEEN ON CARP 
IT'S NO SECRET THAT THE OCEAN'S 
FISH STOCKS ARE TWINNEDLING SOME 
SPAOESIES HAVE BEEN PUSHED TO THE 
BRINK OF EXTINCTION BY OUR DESIRE 
FOR FISH SUPPERS SO WHAT ARE WE 
GOING TO DO DOES THE ANSWER LIE 
HERE ON THE MAINLAND WELL HUSBAND 
AND WIFE TEAM PENNY AND JIMMIE 
HEPBURN THINK IT DOES THEY'RE ON A 
MISSION TO GET US BRITS HOOKED GET 
IT ON CARP 
THIS HUMBLE LOOKING FISH IS 
INCREDIBLY POPULAR IN OTHER PARTS 
OF THE WORLD ESPECIALLY CHINA AND 
EASTERN EUROPE WHERE IT'S 
CONSIDERED A DELICACY 
IT WAS POPULAR HERE IN BRITAIN BACK 
IN THE MIDDLE AGES TOO WHEN IT WAS 
FIRST INTRODUCED SO MUCH SO IN 
FACT THAT MANY VILLAGES AND 
MONASTERIES HAD THEIR OWN CARP 
PONDS BUT ITS DECLINE IN POPULARITY 
COINCIDED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF 
FRIDGATORS TRAWLERS AND SINCE SINCE 
THEN WE HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW TO EAT 
FISH LIKE THIS 
THIS IS ONE OF OUR 
CARP THESE ARE TWO YEARS OLD WE 
WON'T BE HARVESTING THESE UNTIL 
HOPEFULLY THE NEXT WIN T. R. 
IT KIND 
OF BEGS THE QUESTION WHY CARP WELL WELL WE WANTED TO GROW A SPECIES OF FISH 
THAT WAS MORE SUSTAINABLE AND 
COMPARED TO THE LIKES OF SALMON AND 
TROUT CARP ARE MUCH EASIER TO GROW 
WHY IS CARP MORE SUSTAINABLE THAN 
FARMED TROUT OR SALMON WELL WELL UNLIKE TROUT AND SALMON WHICH ARE 
CARIFEROUS THEY ARE LIKE CHICKEN 
THEY EAT PLANT 
AND ANIMAL TROUT TROUT AND SALMON ARE FED ON FISH YEAH YEAH FISH MEAL WHICH IS CAUGHT FISH TO 
GO INTO THE PELLETS 
YOU ACTUALLY 
CREATE THE FOOD FOR THE FISH AND 
IT'S DONE HERE 
YES ABOUT HALF OUR 
FOOD IS ACTUALLY CREATED IN THE 
POND AND OTHER PARTS WE GET FROM 
LOCAL FARMERS SOME GRAIN AND WE 
GROW MEALWORMS TO SUPPLEMENT 
PROTEIN PROTEIN SO PENNY THESE ARE THE MEALWORM 
CAN I TRY SOME 
YES YOU CAN 
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE 
PROCESS THESE WORMS WHY IS THAT 
THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY ARE FED AS A 
PROTEIN SUPPLEMENT TO THE CARP WE 
FEED THEM EVERY EVENING IN THE 
SEASON AND THEY ABSOLUTELY LOVE 
THEM THEY'RE PART OF THE FLOWER 
BEETLES LIFE CYCLE AND WE FED THEM 
ORGANIC PWRAPB AND APPLES WE GROW 
HERE 
THEY'RE VERY NICE BUT YOU CAN HERE HAVE THEM BACK I DON'T ENJOY 
HOLDING THEM YOU WILL BE PLEASED 
TO KNOW THAT ANY FLAVOURS OF 
MEALWORMS OR MUDDY WATER ARE 
FLUSHED AWAY WITH SPRING WATER 
BEFORE COOKING 
THEN IT GOES IN THE OVEN 
WELL IT 
LOOKS VERY VERY NICE 
IT SMELLS NICE 
IS THIS YOUR OWN RECIPE 
IT'S MY 
SORT OF VERSION OF AN ORIENTAL 
RECIPE 
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH RECIPE ACTUALLY VERY NICE 
IT DOESN'T TASTE FISHY AT ALL IT'S 
VERY LIGHT AS WELL VERY NICELY 
COOKED CAN 
I SAY I LOVE WHEN WHEN 
PEOPLE SAY IT TASTES LIKE SEABASS 
WHICH I LIKE I DON'T LIKE FISHY 
FISH IT'S MEATY ENOUGH IT'S A 
NICE TEXTURE AND IT'S SUSTAINABLE 
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO FEEL GUILTY 
EXACTLY 
AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT WE DON'T GET 
A LOT OF LUCK ON THIS PROGRAMME 
MIKE LEIGH IS A MASSIVE CARP FAN OF 
ALL THINGS WHAT IS YOUR LOVE OF 
CARP 
I LOVE IT IT'S MY FAVOURITE CARP FISH I COOK IT AS OFTEN AS I CAN 
YOU CAN GET CARP THIS BIG THIS BIG 
AND THAT BIG YOU CAN COOK THEM 
VARIOUS WAYS FRY THEM STEAM THEME 
BUT I LIKE WE HAVE JUST SEEN 
BAKED IS FANTASTIC YOU HAVE ONE 
HERE 
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND DOING HERE THE CARVING WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF 
IT LUCY 
I REALLY LIKED THE CARP 
IT WAS A MUCH SMALLER FISH THAN 
THAT ONE I LIKE THE WAY SHE COOKED 
IT AND I DON'T LIKE FISHY FISH IT 
WAS REALLY PERFECT FOR ME AND THE 
FACT THEY'RE SO SUSTAINABLY 
PRODUCED IS OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW A 
REAL BONUS BECAUSE WE HAVE A REAL 
PROBLEM WITH ALL EATING COD TELL TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT IS 
SUSTAINABLE AND WHAT ISN'T WHILE 
MIKE CARVES 
SUSTAINABLE FISH ARE 
FISH WHERE THEY'RE FROM FISHERIES 
WHERE THE FISH WILL BE REPLENISHED 
WHAT WE ARE DOING AT THE MOMENT WE 
ARE OVERFISHING CERTAIN SPECIES 
SUCH AS COD WHICH WE ALL EAT ALL 
THE TIME SO WE PUT THOSE SPECIES 
UNDER THREAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR 
FISH THAT ARE SUSTAINABLELY CAUGHT 
SO THEY DON'T USE TRAWLERS TO GIVE 
THEM A CHANCE OF BREEDING TO KEEP 
THAT REPLENISH SO WE DON'T WIPE OUT 
THE STOCKS 
WE LOOK FOR THAT LOGO 
THIS IS THE M. S. C. TICK A LOT OF 
STORES ARE USING THIS HAVE 
CERTIFIED THEIR FISH THIS MEANS 
IT'S FROM SOMEWHERE FROM A 
SUSTAINABLE FISHERY SO YOU KNOW 
IT'S ALL RIGHT TO EAT 
WHEN YOU ARE IN A RESTAURANT OF 
COURSE IT'S DIFFICULT TO BE LOOKING 
FOR LITTLE TICKS THEN 
YOU SHOULD 
ASK QUESTIONS I THINK THERE IS 
ALSO THE MARINE CONSERVATION 
SOCIETY THEY PRODUCE A BOOKLET 
YOU CAN PUT ONE IN YOUR POCKET IN IN TERMS OF SUSTAINABLE FISH WHAT 
SHOULD WE AVOID 
YOU SHOULD AVOID 
SKATE BLUEFIN TUNA AND SWORDFISH 
IF YOU WENT OUT ON DATE WITH A 
BLOKE ARE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND HE 
ORDERED THAT THAT WOULD BE IT NOT NOT INTERESTED ABSOLUTELY 
WHAT SHOULD YOU GO FOR 
YOU SHOULD 
GO FOR POLLOCK DOVER SOLE AND 
MACKEREL BUT THEY SHOULD STILL 
HAVE THAT THAT TICK SO THEY'RE 
FROM A SUSTAINABLE SOURCE 
IT MUST TAKE YOU AN HOUR TO ORDER 
ANYTHING MIKE YOU HAVE DONE A 
FANTASTIC JOB 
THIS IS MY FIRST 
TIME TASTING CARP IN FRONT OF MIKE 
LEIGH IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER 
THAN THAT 
THERE WE GO I WILL HAVE 
THAT LITTLE BIT 
THAT'S A BIG BIT 
FIRST TIME FOR ME AS WELL THAT'S 
BRAVE BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T HAD IT 
BEFORE BEFORE I THINK IT'S A BIT MUDDY IT HAS 
THE REPUTATION OF TASTING QUITE 
MUDDY SOMETIMES I THINK THAT DOES 
MAYBE IT'S THE WAY IT'S COOKED LET LET ME TASTE THIS IT CAN BE MUDDY BUT 
THERE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO TO 
STOP THAT HAPPENING 
WELL WE 
OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T 
ANGELLICA DOESN'T 
LIKE IT AND SHE HAS EATEN A LARGE 
PIECE NOW 
I THINK THERE IS ALL RIGHT IT'S A 
BIT UNDERSEASONED MAYBE THE THING 
ABOUT IT IS THIS WHAT YOU HAVE TO 
DO IS SORRY I WILL DIIEST THIS I I HAVE JUST SWALLOWED A BONE I MIGHT 
CHOKE TO DEATH 
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO 
IS YOU PUT IT IN FRESH WATER WITH A 
SMALL AMOUNT OF VINEGAR FOR FIVE 
MINUTES BEFORE YOU COOK IT THAT THAT WILL TAKE THE MUDDY 
THAT MAKES 
ALL THE DIFFERENT L. DON'T THINK 
THIS IS GREAT IT'S VERY NICE 
ACTUALLY IT'S A GREAT FISH STUFF 
IT STITCH IT UP BAKE IT THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
MAN OF MANY TALENTS THOSE CARP 
FARMERS TALKED ABOUT GROWING THEIR 
OWN FISH BUT THE ONE SHOW'S 
GARDENER CHRISTINE IS MUCH MORE AT

PRIZE WINING LEEK 
HE SAID DID THE 
PLANT RUN A SEED I SAID I LOST IT

FIX YOU UP WITH A DOZEN PLANTS 
BECAUSE YOU PAID A LOT OF MONEY L.

SEEDING THAT PLANT IT'S A STINKING 
TRICK YEAH 
JOHN DOESN'T ONLY GROW
