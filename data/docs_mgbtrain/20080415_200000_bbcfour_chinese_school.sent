CHINA 
A ONE PARTY COMMUNIST STATE UNDERGOING RAPID CHANGE 
HOME TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION SCHOOL CHILDREN 
AND THE SMALL TOWN OF XIUNING 
THIS IS THE STORY OF THREE SCHOOLS HERE 
AND LIFE OVER THE YEAR OF THE GOLDEN PIG 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE WITH THE POPULATION SPIRALLING 
CHINA INTRODUCED ITS CONTROVERSIAL ONE CHILD POLICY 
CREATING A GENERATION OF ONLY CHILDREN 
BUT CHENG CHAO IS AN EXCEPTION 
IN A COUNTRY WHERE IT'S RARE TO HAVE A SIBLING 
THE PRESSURE ON SCHOOL AGED CHILDREN IS IMMENSE 
AND NEVER MORE SO THAN AT THIS TIME OF YEAR 
IT'S MAY AND THE SCORCHING HEAT OF SUMMER IS SETTING IN 
IN A FEW WEEKS THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WILL FALL SILENT 
AS SENIOR STUDENTS LIKE WU YUFEI 
FACE THE TEST OF THEIR LIVES 
IN THE TOP CLASS 
IT'S THE JOB OF TUTOR MR. HE TO KEEP EVERYONE FOCUSED 
PING MIN PRIMARY SCHOOL LIES THREE MILES TO THE WEST OF TOWN 
AMONGST THE FIELDS AND MOUNTAINS OF XIUNING COUNTY 
IT'S MONDAY MORNING AND THE WEEK BEGINS AS USUAL WITH THE FLAG RAISING CEREMONY 
TODAY THOUGH HEAD TEACHER MRS. JUNG IS FAR FROM HAPPY 
WITH THE CONDUCT OF HER YOUNG SCHOLARS 
WITH STANDARDS SLIPPING TODAY'S CHORES ARE STRICTLY SUPERVISED 
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AIMS TO PROVIDE NINE YEARS OF FREE EDUCATION FOR EVERY CHILD 
BUT IN MANY AREAS STUDENTS PAY FOR THINGS LIKE BOOKS AND MEALS 
PING MIN IS A CHARITY RUN SCHOOL SO EVERYTHING IS FREE 
EIGHT YEAR OLD CHENG CHAO IS IN CLASS ONE 
CHENG CHAO IS PASSING ON A SKILL TO HIS CLASSMATES THAT HE LEARNED FROM HIS CARPENTER FATHER 
THE CHILDREN OF PING MIN 
ARE REHEARSING FOR ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE SCHOOL CALENDAR CHILDREN'S DAY 
FOR CHENG CHAO'S CLASS THE DAY HAS EXTRA SIGNIFICANCE 
IT MARKS THEIR FIRST STEPS WITH THE COMMUNIST PARTY 
BECOMING A YOUNG PIONEER IS AN IMPORTANT RIGHT OF PASSAGE IN EVERY CHINESE CHILD'S LIFE 
AND IS THE BEGINNING FOR MANY OF A LIFE LONG ASSOCIATION WITH THE COMMUNIST PARTY 
ACROSS TOWN AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL ANOTHER CEREMONY IS UNDERWAY 
HERE THE END OF CHILDHOOD IS BEING MARKED 
AFTER BEING ADDRESSED BY SENIOR STUDENTS 
THERE'S A SPEECH FROM THE SCHOOL'S COMMUNIST PARTY SECRETARY 
AT EIGHTEEN STUDENTS ARE RECOGNISED AS ADULTS THEY CAN MOVE ON FROM THE COMMUNIST YOUTH LEAGUE 
WHICH EVERYBODY JOINS AT FOURTEEN TO BEING ELIGIBLE FOR FULL PARTY MEMBERSHIP 
ALTHOUGH THIS REMAINS A PRIVILEGE ENJOYED BY A VERY SMALL PROPORTION OF CHINESE CITIZENS 
XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL IS WHAT'S KNOWN IN CHINA AS A KEY SCHOOL 
ITS STRONG ACADEMIC TRACK RECORD 
MEANS THAT STUDENTS ARE THE CREME DE LA CREME OF THE COUNTY 
AND BENEFIT FROM THE BEST TEACHERS AND FACILITIES AVAILABLE 
IN JUST OVER A WEEK'S TIME 
THE FINAL YEAR STUDENTS AT XIUNING FACE THE MOST IMPORTANT RIGHT OF PASSAGE OF THEIR ACADEMIC LIVES 
THE UNIVERSALLY FEARED G. A. O. KAO EXAMS 
AS G. A. O. KAO IS COMING CLOSER APPROACHING 
I THINK THE ATMOSPHERE IS DIFFERENT THAN BEFORE 
I CAN SENSE THAT MANY STUDENTS HAVE A LOT OF PRESSURE 
AS WELL AS BEING AN ENGLISH TEACHER 
MR. HE IS A CLASS TUTOR OF ONE OF THE ELEVEN SENIOR CLASSES FACING THE G. A. O. KAO 
BEING A TEACHER MEANS A LOT TO ME BEING A TEACHER MEANS 
SOMETIMES A FRIEND I SERVE MY STUDENTS WITH THE WHOLE OF MY HEART 
IT'S HIS JOB TO SUPPORT HIS CLASS AND ENSURE A GOOD PASS RATE 
FOR THESE BRIGHT STUDENTS IT WOULD BE DISASTROUS TO FAIL 
IF YOU FAIL G. A. O. KAO 
CHANCES ARE YOU WON'T BE ADMITTED TO COLLEGES OR UNIVERSITIES 
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO FIND GOOD JOBS IN THE FUTURE 
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD WU YUFEI IS IN MR. HE'S CLASS 
IN THE LAST THREE YEARS MR. HE HAS BECOME SOMETHING OF A MENTOR TO XIUNING'S TOP STUDENT 
MY STUDENT YUFEI IS NOT ONLY THE BEST STUDENT HERE IN THIS SCHOOL 
BUT ALSO THE BEST STUDENT IN OUR CITY 
EVEN ONE OF THE BEST STUDENTS IN OUR PROVINCE 
EVEN IN THE COUNTRY 
I'M VERY PROUD OF HER 
SHE WORKS HARD 
SHE NEVER FAILS IN ANY SINGLE EXAM 
WU YUFEI GOT THE HIGHEST MARK IN THE SCHOOL'S HISTORY IN HER MOCK EXAMS 
SO THE EXPECTATIONS FOR G. A. O. KAO ARE EXTREMELY HIGH IF SHE DOES WELL 
SHE HOPES TO BE ACCEPTED TO TSINGHUA CHINA'S TOP UNIVERSITY IN BEIJING 
IT'S A PRIVILEGE RESERVED FOR ONLY A TINY MINORITY 
SHE HAS MORE PRESSURE THAN OTHERS ALL EYES ARE FIXED ON HER 
MANDARIN CHINESE IS SPOKEN BY MORE PEOPLE THAN ANY OTHER LANGUAGE IN THE WORLD 
ENGLISH REMAINS THE MOST WIDELY TALKED FOREIGN LANGUAGE 
GOOD MORNING 
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU 
FROM THE AGE OF TWELVE 
ALL CHINESE STUDENTS RECEIVE SOME LEVEL OF ENGLISH TUITION 
THE HEIGHT OF FASHION AMONGST THE JUNIOR STUDENTS IS TO CHOOSE A COOL ENGLISH NAME FOR THEMSELVES 
MY ENGLISH NAME IS BENJAMIN 
MY ENGLISH NAME IS JEFF 
RING R. I N. G. RING 
MY ENGLISH NAME IS AUGUST BECAUSE I LIKE AUGUST VERY MUCH 
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE GIRL LOVES THE BOY DEEPLY 
BUT THE BOY IS YOUNG 
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT WU LIN 
IS PREPARING A SPEECH FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S ENGLISH CONTEST 
IT'S NOT JUST WU LIN'S LOVE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE THAT'S MOTIVATED HER CHOICE OF TOPIC 
HOW TO BE GRATEFUL IN OUR LIFE YEAH 
WU LIN'S SECRET LOVE FANG YUEN IS ALSO REHEARSING FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S COMPETITION 
BUT THEY'RE KEEPING A SAFE DISTANCE FROM ONE ANOTHER 
THIS CAN HELP US FIND OUR COURAGE TO OVERCOME 
THE DIFFICULTIES WE MAY FACE 
GOOD AFTERNOON LADIES AND GENTLEMENT 
WELCOME TO OUR ENGLISH IS A BEACH CONTEST

AND TWENTY SIX CANDIDATES 
THE TWO WINNERS OF THIS QUALIFYING ROUND

THE TOPIC OF MY SPEECH IS CHOPSTICKS 
MANY FRIENDS TRY TO USE CHOPSTICKS WHEN THEY VISIT CHINA

LET'S FIGHT FOR A BRIGHT FUTURE TOGETHER TAKE ACTION NOW THANK YOU

WU LIN'S SPEECH HAS GONE DOWN WELL WITH THE JUDGES 
IT'S A HARD ACT TO FOLLOW FOR BOYFRIEND FENG YUEN 
I CAN'T REMEMBER IT SORRY 
AND NOW THE BOY IS A MAN 
A MAN WHO'S ALWAYS WITH A DREAM 
AND THE MAN IS ME 
I BELIEVE THAT ONE DAY

WU LIN FINDS OUT SHE'S MADE IT THROUGH TO THE REGIONAL FINAL 
AND WU LIN NOW PLEASE COME TO THE STAGE 
I THINK I AM HAPPY BECAUSE 
I HAVE TRIED MY BEST 
I HOPE I CAN BE THE WINNER AT LAST THANK YOU 
THE DAY AT XIUNING COUNTY'S OTHER SENIOR SCHOOL BEGINS AT SEVEN THIRTY 
ALTHOUGH HAIYANG MIDDLE SCHOOL HAS A MORE RELAXED APPROACH THAN XIUNING HIGH 
THE BOARDERS STILL HAVE TO GET UP FOR BREAKFAST AT SIX THIRTY 
BUT DAY STUDENT WANG LINGQI HAS PERFECTED THE ART OF THE LONG LIE IN 
HIS PARENTS LIVE IN A VILLAGE AN HOUR FROM TOWN 
SO HE LIVES ALONE IN A FLAT FIVE MINUTES FROM SCHOOL 
LIVING ALONE MEANS HE SETS HIS OWN TIMETABLE 
ARRIVING AT HIS FIRST LESSON WITH MINUTES TO SPARE 
NORMAL MIDDLE SCHOOLS 
SUCH AS HAIYANG TAKE STUDENTS LIKE WANG LINGQI WHO DIDN'T DO WELL ENOUGH AT JUNIOR LEVEL 
TO GET INTO THE LOCAL KEY SCHOOL XIUNING HIGH 
BUT WANG LINGQI IS HAPPY IN THE LESS PRESSURISED ATMOSPHERE OF HAIYANG 
UP TO A POINT 
IN HIS LUNCH HOUR 
WANG LINGQI NIPS BACK TO HIS FLAT TO MEET HIS GIRLFRIEND WANG YU CHEUNG WHO LIVES WITH HER PARENTS 
WHILE WANG LINGQI TUCKS INTO THE LUNCH HIS GIRLFRIEND HAS MADE 
SHE GETS ON WITH DOING HIS WASHING 
WHEN THE TWO SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS FIRST GOT TOGETHER 
THEIR PARENTS WEREN'T TOO KEEN ON THE IDEA 
BACK AT HAIYANG 
AFTERNOON LESSONS ARE UNDERWAY 
THE SCHOOL HAS OVER THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS AGED TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN 
NUMBER SEVEN WHAT DO YOU THINK A PARTY IS 
TWELVE YEAR OLD WANG JIANWEN IS IN HIS FIRST YEAR AT HAIYANG 
IN COMMON WITH A QUARTER OF THE FAMILIES IN ANHUI PROVINCE 
WANG JIANWEN'S PARENTS ARE MIGRANT WORKERS 
AND WORK IN A GARMENT FACTORY IN A CITY FOUR HOURS AWAY 
SO HE STAYS WITH HIS GRANDFATHER 
HIS TEACHER MS. LEE KEEPS AN EYE ON HIM 
LIKE MOST CHINESE KIDS WANG JIANWEN IS AN ONLY CHILD 
HE'S LIVED WITH HIS GRANDPA SINCE HIS MUM AND DAD WENT TO WORK IN THE CITY 
THREE YEARS AGO HE SEES HIS PARENTS TWICE A YEAR AT CHINESE NEW YEAR 
AND IN THE SCHOOL SUMMER HOLIDAYS 
AT PING MIN PRIMARY SCHOOL IT'S HAIRCUT DAY 
BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH OPTION ON THE STYLING FRONT 
CHENG CHAO HAS PRETTY FIXED IDEAS WHEN IT COMES TO HAIR STYLES 
THE MAJORITY OF THE KIDS AT PING MIN DON'T HAVE ANY BROTHERS OR SISTERS 
AS A RESULT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANNED BIRTH OR ONE CHILD POLICY 
LIKE XIUNING COUNTY 
IF YOUR FIRST BORN CHILD IS A GIRL OR HAS A DISABILITY 
YOU CAN GET PERMISSION TO HAVE A SECOND CHILD 
CHENG CHAO IS IN THE VERY RARE SITUATION OF HAVING AN ELDER BROTHER 
LIKE ALL PING MIN STUDENTS CHENG CHAO IS A BOARDER AT SCHOOL 
BUT TODAY HE'S AT HOME AND IS ENJOYING THE BENEFITS OF BEING REUNITED WITH HIS BIG BROTHER 
ALTHOUGH THEY KNEW THEY WERE BREAKING THE LAW CHENG CHAO'S PARENTS 
DECIDED TO HAVE A SECOND CHILD AS THEIR ELDEST SON HAD BEEN UNWELL AS AN INFANT 
IF YOU DECIDE TO GO AHEAD WITH A SECOND PREGNANCY WITHOUT PERMISSION 
THE AUTHORITIES EVENTUALLY RELENTED 
AND THE FAMILY ENDED UP PAYING A REDUCED FINE OF THREE THOUSAND YUAN 
AROUND TWO HUNDRED 
CHENG CHAO'S PARENTS BORROWED THE MONEY TO PAY THE FINE FROM FRIENDS AND RELATIVES 
AT THE RIPE OLD AGE OF EIGHT CHENG CHAO HAS ALREADY DECIDED HE WON'T FOLLOW HIS PARENTS' LEAD 
LIKE THE STUDENTS 
MANY OF XIUNING HIGH'S ONE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT TEACHERS LIVE AT SCHOOL 
ART TEACHER LIN REI LIVES IN THE TEACHER'S DORM 
BUT IS LOOKING FORWARD TO LEAVING IT BEHIND 
LIN REI GOT MARRIED LAST YEAR AND IS TWENTY WEEKS PREGNANT 
SHE'S PICKED A PARTICULARLY AUSPICIOUS YEAR TO HAVE HER BABY 
AT TWENTY WEEKS IT'S TIME FOR LIN REI AND HER HUSBAND TO ATTEND A CLINIC 
AND SEE A SCAN OF THEIR BABY FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THE YEAR OF THE GOLDEN PIG HAS CAUSED THE PREGNANCY RATES TO SOAR 
AND MATERNITY HOSPITALS THROUGHOUT CHINA ARE FACING HUGE DEMANDS FROM SUPERSTITIOUS YOUNG PARENTS 
TODAY XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT WU LIN IS ON A RESEARCH TRIP 
FOR THE NEXT ROUND OF THE ENGLISH CONTEST SHE HAS TO WRITE A NEW SPEECH 
WITH THE TITLE SAVING IS EARNING 
WU LIN HAS CHOSEN A SUBJECT CLOSE TO HER HEART 
THE ENVIRONMENT 
SHE'S COME TO AN OLD TOWN 
HALF A MILE FROM HER SCHOOL 
PEOPLE HERE HAVE LIVED OFF THE RIVER FOR GENERATIONS 
WANG JIANWEN IS AT HIS AUNTY AND UNCLE'S HOUSE 
AFTER AN ACCIDENT LANDED HIM IN HOSPITAL 
BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE 
HE'S HEARD THAT HIS DAD IS ON HIS WAY TO SEE HIM 
IT'S BEEN FOUR MONTHS SINCE WANG JIANWEN SAW HIS FATHER HE CAN'T CONTAIN HIS EXCITEMENT 
WANG JIANWEN'S DAD IS PART OF THE LARGEST MIGRATION IN HUMAN HISTORY 
THE MOVEMENT OF ALMOST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION RURAL WORKERS TO THE CITIES IN SEARCH OF A BETTER LIFE 
IS RAPIDLY CHANGING THE FACE OF CHINA 
MR. WANG GREW UP IN THE SEVENTIES AND HAD EIGHT BROTHERS AND SISTERS 
BUT WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ONE CHILD POLICY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE 
WANG JIANWEN WAS DESTINED TO BE AN ONLY CHILD 
IT'S SATURDAY MORNING IN XIUNING WANG JIANWEN AND HIS DAD ARE MAKING THE MOST OF THEIR TIME TOGETHER 
BUT THE MAIN REASON FOR THEIR TRIP INTO TOWN IS TO VISIT THE HOSPITAL 
FOR WANG JIANWEN'S CHECK UP 
HAIYANG MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENT WANG LINGQI IS STARTING HIS WEEKEND WITH A VISIT TO THE HAIRDRESSER 
WATCHED OVER BY GIRLFRIEND WANG YU CHEUNG 
WANG LINGQI IS SPENDING THE REST OF HIS WEEKEND AT HOME IN HIS VILLAGE WITH HIS PARENTS 
HIS FIRST STOP IS A RARE VISIT TO HIS DAD'S FACTORY 
HIS DAD EMPLOYS TWELVE VILLAGERS MAKING MOTORBIKE COMPONENTS 
ALTHOUGH HE'S PROUD OF HIS SUCCESS HE HOPES FOR MORE FOR HIS SON'S FUTURE 
SO WITH A BRIGHT FUTURE AHEAD OF HIM 
DOES HIS DAD THINK WANG LINGQI SHOULD HAVE A GIRLFRIEND AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN 
EIGHT THIRTY IS BEDTIME FOR THE CHILDREN OF PING MIN PRIMARY 
BUT TONIGHT THERE'S EXCITEMENT IN THE BOYS' DORM AS CHENG CHAO AND HIS FRIENDS 
LOOK FORWARD TO A BIG DAY 
CHILDREN'S DAY IS AN INTERNATIONAL CELEBRATION OF CHILDHOOD 
TODAY EVERY PRIMARY SCHOOL IN CHINA IS HAVING A PARTY FOR THE FIRST YEARS 
TODAY IS THE DAY THEY WILL GET TO WEAR RED NECKERCHIEFS LIKE THEIR ELDERS 
AND BECOME YOUNG PIONEERS 
THERE IS A SURPRISE FOR CHENG CHAO 
HIS MUM HAS TAKEN TIME OFF WORK TO COME ALONG FOR HIS BIG DAY 
CHENG CHAO IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO GET HIS RED TIE 
AS HE HAS SOME SPECIAL DUTIES TO PERFORM 
IT'S WITH HEAVY HEART THAT WANG JIANWEN HITCHES A RIDE TO SCHOOL BEFORE HAVING TO 
SAY GOODBYE TO HIS DAD ONCE AGAIN 
BACK AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL 
THE G. A. O. KAO EXAM IS NOW IMMINENT 
WITH TEMPERATURES SOARING THE PRESSURE MOUNTS 
AS THE ENTIRE SCHOOL FOCUSES ON PREPARING FOR 
THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT DAYS IN THE LIVES OF THE SENIOR STUDENTS 
JANE YOU ARE SO YOUNG 
HOW CAN YOU SING SO WELL 
FOR THE ENGLISH COMPREHENSION EXAM EACH STUDENT MUST TUNE A SPECIAL HEADSET INTO A RADIO FREQUENCY 
TODAY A TEST TRANSMISSION IS BEING BROADCAST THROUGHOUT THE CAMPUS 
MR. HE IS KEEN TO MAKE SURE HIS STUDENTS ARE ALL TUNED IN 
IN PARTICULAR TOP STUDENT WU YUFEI 
I BELIEVE YOU'LL DO A WONDERFUL JOB TONIGHT 
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS BUT NOT VERY MUCH 
IT'S NOT JUST THE STUDENTS WHO ARE FEELING THE HEAT THE TEACHERS WHO WILL SUPERVISE THE EXAMS 
HAVE COME INTO A MEETING WITH THE LOCAL EDUCATION HEAD 
IT'S CLEAR THERE'S NO ROOM FOR SLIP UPS 
AS WE ALL KNOW 
THE ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION HAS BECOME ONE OF THE EMERGENCIES 
WHICH SLOW DOWN THE PACE OF CHINA'S DEVELOPMENT 
YOUNGER STUDENTS HAVE LESS EXAM PRESSURE 
AFTER HER RESEARCH TRIP TO THE POLLUTED RIVERSIDE 
WU LIN IS MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO HER SPEECH BEFORE THE BIG FINAL OF THE ENGLISH COMPETITION 
NOW WE SHOULD CALL FOR THE ATTENTIONS OF MORE PEOPLE 
TO EVERYONE AMONG US 
THANK YOU O. K. 
THE REGIONAL FINAL OF THE ENGLISH SPEECH COMPETITION 
IS TAKING PLACE IN THE TOWN OF SHEXIAN FIFTY K. M. TO THE EAST OF XIUNING 
WU LIN WILL BE COMPETING AGAINST TWENTY EIGHT CONFIDENT STUDENTS FROM SCHOOLS ALL ACROSS THE REGION 
TODAY MY TOPIC IS SAVING IS EARNING 
WE ARE FACING THE MOST SERIOUS RESOURCES CRISIS NOW 
TIME IS MONEY 
WILL WE BE PREPARED FOR THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES ALL OUR LIVES 
DO YOU GO TO PERM YOUR HAIR VERY OFTEN 
IF YOU HAVE THESE HABITS GET RID OF THEM 
TO SAVE IS TO EARN THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
IT'S TIME FOR WU LIN TO DELIVER HER VERY PERSONAL SPEECH 
I HAVE SEEN AN OLD MAN WHO IS A FERRYMAN 
MAYBE IT IS DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO IMAGINE WHAT HIS HANDS ARE LIKE 
THOSE ARE ROUGH HANDS AND THE SKIN IS BLISTERED AND DISCOLOURED 
JUST BECAUSE OF THE POLLUTION OF THE WATER 
WE SHOULD ASK OURSELVES 
WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND WHAT WE SHOULD DO NEXT 
THANK YOU 
AFTER TWENTY NINE SPEECHES ON THE SAME SUBJECT THE JUDGES CONVENE 
TO TALLY THE SCORES 
NO MATTER WHAT THE RESULT WU LIN SEEMS PLEASED WITH HER PERFORMANCE 
IT'S PRIZES ALL ROUND 
AND WU LIN HAS COME NINTH 
BYE 
AT XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL TIME HAS FINALLY RUN OUT FOR THE SENIOR STUDENTS 
THE G. A. O. KAO EXAMS BEGIN TOMORROW 
THESE LAST VITAL DAYS OF THE SCHOOL YEAR ARE THE END OF A CHAPTER FOR TEACHER MR. HE 
THAT IS THE LAST DAY BEFORE THEY TAKE G. A. O. KAO 
I FEEL A LITTLE SAD BECAUSE IN TWO DAY'S TIME 
THE STUDENTS WILL GO WILL LEAVE ME 
THEY HAVE BEEN MY FRIENDS WE HAVE KEPT EACH OTHER GOOD COMPANY FOR THREE YEARS 
AND YOU FEEL IT'S SAD 
HEAD TEACHER MR. HU HAS SEEN TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF G. A. O. KAO EXAMS AT XIUNING 
BUT HE HOPES THE SCHOOL'S STAR PUPIL IS GOING TO MAKE THIS A YEAR TO REMEMBER 
WU YUFEI LIVES IN A SCHOOL APARTMENT DURING TERM TIME 
TO MAXIMISE HER STUDY TIME HER MUM GAVE UP HER JOB TO DEVOTE THIS YEAR 
TO LOOKING AFTER HER DAUGHTER'S NEEDS SHE STAYS WITH HER MOST NIGHTS 
MY MOTHER SAYS SHE IS FEELING O. K. BUT I THINK SHE IS MORE NERVOUS THAN ME 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I NEED TO DO NOW IS TO RELAX I'M GOING TO WEAR 
A SPECIAL SHIRT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S MY LUCKY SHIRT 
AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THE SENIOR STUDENTS HEAD BACK TO CLASS 
FOR THEIR LAST HOURS OF STUDY BEFORE THE BIG DAY MR. HE IS DETERMINED 
TO SEND THEM OFF IN THE RIGHT FRAME OF MIND 
EVERYBODY IS READY I THINK THEY CAN'T WAIT WAITING IS TOO TIRING 
IT'S THE MORNING OF G. A. O. KAO 
TEN MILLION STUDENTS ACROSS CHINA WILL SIT FOUR PAPERS 
OVER TWO BOILING HOT DAYS IN JUNE 
FOR FAMILIES IN XIUNING COUNTY A GOOD RESULT IN THE G. A. O. KAO 
CAN MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POVERTY AND PROSPERITY 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY 
BUILDING SITES ARE CLOSED DOWN FLIGHT PATHS REDIRECTED 
AND EVERY SCHOOL HAS ITS OWN POLICE GUARD 
ACROSS TOWN AT HAIYANG MIDDLE SCHOOL HEAD TEACHER MR. WU IS MAKING SURE 
HIS STUDENTS HAVE A HEARTY BREAKFAST BEFORE THE EXAM 
OUTSIDE A CONVOY OF BUSES AWAITS TO TRANSPORT THE STUDENTS ACROSS TOWN TO XIUNING HIGH SCHOOL 
WHICH IS THE EXAM CENTRE FOR THE REGION 
FOR THE SENIOR STUDENTS OF HAIYANG MIDDLE SCHOOL 
SITTING THE EXAM AT THE MORE PRESTIGIOUS ACADEMIC HIGH SCHOOL ACROSS TOWN 
ONLY ADDS TO THE TENSION BUT THEY'RE PRETTY SURE THEY'VE GOT THE EDGE ON THEIR HOSTS IN OTHER AREAS 
ENSURING THAT EACH CLASS GETS THE CORRECT PAPERS IS METICULOUSLY REGIMENTED 
DESPITE ALL THE PREPARATIONS THINGS ARE NOT GOING TO PLAN 
AS THE STUDENTS TAKE THEIR SEATS IN THE EXAM ROOM THERE'S ONE WHO'S CUTTING IT A BIT FINE 
WU YUFEI HAS SPENT THE NIGHT AT HOME AND IS RUNNING LATE 
BUT THANKS TO A LIFT FROM HER DAD 
HAS JUST MADE IT ON TIME SPORTING HER LUCKY SHIRT 
THE STUDENTS HAVE TO BE SEATED A FULL HALF HOUR BEFORE THE EXAM BEGINS 
TO LISTEN TO THE STRICT RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT MUST BE OBSERVED TO THE LETTER 
MANY PARENTS WAIT OUTSIDE IN THE SEARING HEAT FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S SAFE RETURN 
WITH ONE EXAM DOWN 
THE STUDENTS HAVE A COUPLE OF HOURS OFF TO EAT AND REST BEFORE THE NEXT ONE BEGINS 
I'M CONFIDENT 
THE G. A. O. KAO EXAM HAS ONLY EXISTED IN ITS CURRENT HIGH PRESSURE FORM SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN 
INTRODUCED AFTER THE END OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION 
THE SCHOOLING OF A GENERATION HAD BEEN HUGELY DISRUPTED BY CHAIRMAN MAO'S ATTEMPTS 
TO RID THE COUNTRY OF WHAT HE SAW AS ITS ELITE EDUCATED CLASS 
SCHOOLS WERE COMPLETELY CLOSED FOR THREE YEARS 
AND THERE WERE NO EXAMS FOR OVER A DECADE 
THE HEAD TEACHERS OF BOTH XIUNING AND HAIYANG 
WERE AMONGST THE FIRST TO SIT THE EXAM WHEN IT WAS REINTRODUCED 
THE TWO DAYS OF GRUELLING G. A. O. KAO EXAMS ARE ALMOST OVER 
THE ENGLISH PAPER IS THE FOURTH AND FINAL HURDLE 
HOW MUCH ARE THESE SHOES 
THEY ARE THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A PAIR 
DO YOU HAVE SIZE NINE 
I AM AFRAID THEY ARE SOLD OUT 
FOR WU YUFEI 
IT'S BEEN A DIFFICULT COUPLE OF DAYS 
SHE HEADS STRAIGHT FOR A DEBRIEF WITH HER MENTOR MR. HE 
I WAS EXTREMELY NERVOUS THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY 
I WAS SO NERVOUS THAT I COULDN'T FALL ASLEEP UNTIL TWO A M. 
THE LAST TWO DAYS HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME 
I DIDN'T SLEEP VERY WELL AT NIGHT 
AND I HAD TO BE UP VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING 
I HAD TO YOU KNOW BE WITH MY STUDENTS ALL THE TIME 
AS IF TWO FULL DAYS OF EXAMS WEREN'T ENOUGH 
THE G. A. O. KAO STUDENTS HAVE TO RETURN TO SCHOOL THE NEXT MORNING TO BE GIVEN 
THE CORRECT ANSWERS TO THEIR EXAMS 
AND CALCULATE AN ESTIMATED SCORE 
THE MARKS THEY CALCULATE HERE 
WILL BE USED BY THE SCHOOL TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF APPLYING FOR UNIVERSITY 
ALMOST EVERYONE HAS TURNED UP TO PERFORM THIS ARDUOUS TASK BUT THERE'S ONE EMPTY DESK 
STAR PUPIL WU YUFEI HASN'T APPEARED 
AND MR. HE IS CONCERNED IF SHE DOESN'T COME AND FILL IN THE FORM 
HER UNIVERSITY PLACE COULD BE AT RISK 
MR. HE IS WORRIED ENOUGH TO CALL HER MUM 
HER MUM TOLD ME THAT SHE HAS JUST GOT UP 
SHE WAS VERY TIRED DURING THE PAST FEW DAYS 
SHE'S COMING YEAH SHE'S COMING 
FOR SOME SEEING THE ANSWERS IS CAUSE FOR CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM 
BUT FOR OTHERS IT ONLY INCREASES THEIR WORRIES ABOUT THEIR FINAL RESULT 
EVEN HIGH ACHIEVER WU YUFEI IS FINDING IT HARD TO COPE 
I THINK SHE IS BEING TOO HARD ON HERSELF 
SHE DID VERY WELL I THINK 
MUCH HIGHER THAN ANY OF THE OTHER STUDENTS 
BUT FOR NOW ALL WU YUFEI AND HER FRIENDS CAN DO IS WAIT 
THE TWO LONG WEEKS UNTIL THE EXAM RESULTS COME OUT 
FOR WANG JIANWEN THE WAITING IS ALREADY OVER AFTER WEARING HIS SPLINTS FOR ALMOST A MONTH 
HE IS BACK AT THE HOSPITAL WITH HIS UNCLE TO HAVE THEM REMOVED 
WITH THE SCHOOL TERM ALMOST OVER WANG JIANWEN IS LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HIS MUM AND DAD VERY SOON 
IT'S THE TWENTY FOURTH JUNE 
THE DAY TEN MILLION STUDENTS ACROSS CHINA HAD BEEN WAITING FOR 
TODAY THE G. A. O. KAO RESULTS WILL BE PUBLISHED SIMULTANEOUSLY AND STUDENTS SIT POISED 
TO RECEIVE THEIR MARKS EITHER BY PHONE OR ONLINE 
WU YUFEI AND HER MUM KNOW THE NUMBERS THAT APPEAR ON THE SCREEN 
WILL DETERMINE THE REST OF THEIR LIVES THAT'S IF THE NUMBERS EVER DO APPEAR 
WU YUFEI'S OVERALL RESULT IS AN ASTOUNDING NINETY FOUR PER CENT 
WHICH MEANS SHE HAS DONE WELL ENOUGH TO BE GUARANTEED A PLACE AT CHINA'S TOP UNIVERSITY IN BEIJING 
BUT SHE HAS ALSO DONE HER SCHOOL PROUD 
BY COMING TOP IN THE WHOLE PROVINCE AHEAD OF MORE THAN HALF A MILLION OTHER STUDENTS 
WU YUFEI'S FRIEND HASN'T GOT ACCESS TO THE INTERNET 
AND CALLS HER FRIEND FOR HELP 
EVEN IF SHE HADN'T GOT THE FIRST PLACE 
SHE'S THE BEST STUDENT THE BEST 
THE NEWS THAT WU YUFEI HAS COME TOP TRAVELS THROUGH THE TOWN LIKE WILDFIRE 
THERE ARE SOON BANNERS PROCLAIMING HER SUCCESS HOISTED IN THE TOWN CENTRE FOR ALL TO SEE 
AND LOCAL JOURNALISTS QUEUING UP TO TALK TO HER 
THREE MONTHS AFTER THE EXAMS XIUNING TEACHER LIN REI 
GAVE BIRTH TO A HEALTHY BABY BOY 
PAN LIN YUEN 
NEXT TIME ON CHINESE SCHOOL STAR STUDENT 
WU YUFEI HEADS FOR THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL BEIJING 
WHERE SHE'LL FACE HER GREATEST CHALLENGE YET 
AND THERE'S LOTS MORE ABOUT LIFE AND SCHOOL IN CHINA AT O. P. E. N. TWO N. E. T. 
SO UNFAIR YOU GET NO SAY OVER WHO'S ON YOUR TEAM BUT YOU GET THE BLAME 
IT'S RIDICULOUS 
TELEVISON EMPHASIS ON WINNERS AND LOSERS WHAT ABOUT IDEAS RESEARCH 
I PUT IN ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT YEAH MATE WE'VE ALL GOT A STORY LIKE THAT 
WHERE ARE WE 
ONE BRAND NEW SERIES TWO REGULAR CANDIDATES 
I AM A WINNER I AM
