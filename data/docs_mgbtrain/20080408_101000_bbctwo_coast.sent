THE SHIANT ISLANDS ARE HOME TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST PUFFIN COLONIES AROUND OUR COAST 
EVERY APRIL THOUSANDS OF THESE LITTLE SQUAT BIRDS APPEAR FROM THE NORTH ATLANTIC OCEAN 
ON AN EPIC JOURNEY BACK TO THESE ISLANDS WHERE THEY WERE BORN 
THE PUFFINS HAVE COME HERE TO BREED AND WITH A BIT OF LUCK 
MOST OF THE EGGS WILL HAVE HATCHED BY NOW AND THE PROUD PARENTS SHOULD 
BE SCURRYING IN AND OUT OF THEIR BURROWS WITH FOOD FOR THE CHICKS 
THAT MAKES IT THE BEST TIME OF YEAR FOR ME TO GET CLOSE TO THESE CHARISMATIC BIRDS 
AND FIND OUT JUST HOW WELL THEY SURVIVE ON THESE WINDSWEPT ISLANDS 
DUMPY WITH DAY GLO BILLS TANGERINE FEET AND TAILS THAT LOOK 
AS IF THEY'VE HAD AN ENCOUNTER WITH A CARVING KNIFE 
PUFFINS ARE SURPRISINGLY AGILE BIRDS BOTH IN THE AIR AND IN THE SEA 
USEFUL SKILLS WHEN YOU SPEND OVER SEVEN MONTHS OF THE YEAR 
COVERING THOUSANDS OF MILES OF THE VAST ATLANTIC 
THE SHIANT ISLANDS ARE A FAR CRY FROM THE PUFFINS' SOLITARY OCEAN LIFE 
HERE THEY'VE GOT TO GET ALONG WITH THE NEIGHBOURS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OF THEM 
LIVING SO TIGHTLY PACKED TOGETHER ON THE ISLAND 
PUFFINS HAVE DEVELOPED ADVANCED WAYS OF COMMUNICATING BY CALLING 
TO EACH OTHER USING THEIR BILLS AND DIFFERENT BODY POSTURES 
I'VE JUST BEEN LOOKING AT A GROUP DOWN THERE THERE'S ONE STANDING UP 
VERY STRAIGHT AND UPRIGHT BASICALLY THAT'S SAYING THIS IS MY TERRITORY AND I OWN THIS BURROW 
BUT THEIR POSTURING IS NOT ALL ABOUT PROPERTY 
PUFFINS MATE FOR LIFE AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SPECIAL WAY OF SHOWING AFFECTION 
IN THIS BLEAK ENVIRONMENT 
THERE'S LITTLE IN THE WAY OF BUILDING MATERIAL FOR NESTS 
SO THE PUFFINS HAVE TO BE RESOURCEFUL TO KEEP THEIR LITTLE ONES SAFE IF THEY CAN'T BUILD UP 
THEY DIG DOWN 
HI HI MARTIN HOW ARE YOU DOING 
MARTIN SCOTT CONSERVATION OFFICER WITH THE R. S. P. B. 
KNOWS THIS COLONY WELL 
THIS SLOPE IS JUST LITTERED WITH BURROWS ISN'T IT YEAH HERE'S ONE JUST HERE 
LOOKS PROMISING DOESN'T IT 
DO THEY COME BACK TO THE SAME BURROW EVERY YEAR 
THEY DO THEY COME BACK CLEAN IT OUT AND THEN RE LINE IT 
WITH THIS NICE SORT OF BED OF DRY GRASS 
PUFFINS ARE REALLY THE PERFECT DIGGING MACHINE 
THEY DIG OUT VERY EASILY IN THE SOFT PEATY SOIL HERE SO THAT'S WHY 
THIS EMBANKMENT IS COVERED IN BURROWS THERE'S ALSO A LARGE NUMBER NESTING ON THE ROCKS 
IS THERE ANY ADVANTAGE TO THAT ENVIRONMENT THE ROCKS WILL BE A LOT MORE EXPOSED BUT THEY DRAIN EASIER 
PEATY SOIL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GET WATERLOGGED ALTHOUGH THE PEAT CAN ACT AS AN INSULATOR TO THE NESTS 
HOME LIFE ON THE SHIANT ISLANDS IS MADE EVEN MORE AGREEABLE 
BY THE RICH PICKINGS IN THE SEA THE PLANKTON RICH WATER IS IDEAL 
IF YOU'RE A GREAT SWIMMER AND LOVE TO EAT SMALL FISH 
THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE TO GET UP CLOSE TO THESE VERSATILE BIRDS 
AND OBSERVE HOW WELL THEY PERFORM UNDER WATER 
WATCHING THEM CHASE FISH 
THEIR QUIRKY BODY SHAPE SUDDENLY MAKES SENSE 
THEIR WINGS ACT AS FINS AND THEIR WEBBED FEET BECOME A RUDDER 
MAKING THEM FLY THROUGH THE WATER WITH INCREDIBLE GRACE 
THESE PUFFINS CAN DIVE TO A DEPTH OF OVER SIXTY METRES 
THAT'S AS MUCH AS A FIFTEEN STOREY BUILDING 
ALTHOUGH HERE THEY ONLY DIVE TO AROUND TWENTY METRES 
TO FIND THE SAND EELS THAT THEY FEED ON 
TO SNAP THEIR PREY 
THEY CAN REACH SPEEDS OF FIVE AND A HALF MILES AN HOUR 
SEEING THESE BIRDS UNDER WATER IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THEY'RE ALSO CREATURES OF THE SKY 
AS SLICK AS SEALS BUT AS FLIGHT LOVING AS SEAGULLS 
THE PUFFINS ARE TOTALLY AT HOME HERE BOTH ABOVE AND BELOW THE WATER LINE
