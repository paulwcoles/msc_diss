ONE OF THE TRICKY THINGS ABOUT THE SCRIPT WAS THAT 
YOU'VE GOT AGATHA CHRISTIE IN AN AGATHA CHRISTIE MURDER MYSTERY 
PLENTY OF PEOPLE WRITE DETECTIVE STORIES BUT YOURS ARE THE BEST 
BUT THIS IS THE REAL AGATHA CHRISTIE 
WHY ARE YOU SO GOOD AGATHA CHRISTIE 
ACTION ARMCHAIR DETECTIVE 
BECOME AN ARMCHAIR DETECTIVE AND GET ALL CLUED UP WITH CONFIDENTIAL 
AS WE TRAVEL BACK BEHIND THE SCENES TO BRITAIN IN THE ROARING TWENTIES 
NEVER MIND PLANET ZOG A PARTY IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES THAT'S MORE LIKE IT 
IT'S A MURDER MYSTERY 
MORPHIC RESIDUE 
MORPHIC DOESN'T SOUND VERY NINETEEN TWENTIES 
BUT NOT ONE YOU'VE READ BEFORE 
YOU ARE WONDERFUL 
THERE'S A PARTY ATMOSPHERE ON LOCATION 
IN SOUTH WALES FOR THE FILMING OF THE DOCTOR'S LATEST ADVENTURE 
THIS WEEK THE ART DEPARTMENT HAVE GONE ALL ART DECO 
ARRANGING A PERIOD COCKTAIL RECEPTION WHERE GUESTS WILL SOON BE BOTH SHAKEN AND STIRRED 
BY A MYSTERIOUS DEATH 
WITH SO MANY SHADY SUSPECTS ON SET IT'S MURDER FOR THE DIRECTOR 
AND ACTION 
GOOD AFTERNOON MY LADY 
TOPPING DAY WHAT SPIFFING TOP HOLE 
NO NO NO NO NO DON'T DO THAT DON'T 
AND CUT CAN I JUST DO ERM 
THE MAKING OF THIS WAS VERY TIME CONSUMING BECAUSE 
WHEN YOU'VE GOT NINE OR TEN PEOPLE IN A SCENE THEY ALL HAVE TO BE COVERED 
YOU'VE GOT TO DO A DEVELOPING SHOT THEN A CLOSE UP OF THAT PERSON THEN MOVE ROUND AND DO THAT PERSON 
MAYBE YOU WANT TWO SHOTS AND THREE SHOTS 
THAT ALL TAKES TIME EVERY TIME YOU SET THE CAMERA UP TO DO A NEW SHOT IT'S AT LEAST TWENTY MINUTES EACH TIME 
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER 
LIKE A MONKEY WITH A MINIATURE CYMBAL 
THE JOY OF REPETITION REALLY IS IN YOU 
ACTION 
GOOD AFTERNOON MY LADY TOPPING DAY WHAT 
AND ACTION GOOD AFTERNOON MY LADY 
TOPPING DAY WHAT SPIFFING 
AND ACTION DOCTOR HOW COULD I FORGET YOU 
BUT ONE MUST BE SURE WITH THE UNICORN ON THE LOOSE 
EVERY TIME THEY MOVE IT CREATES A COMPLETELY NEW JIGSAW PUZZLE 
WHEN THERE'S TWO PEOPLE IT'S EASY 
THREE PEOPLE IS NOT TOO BAD FOUR'S STILL O. K. THEN IT STARTS TO BECOME A NIGHTMARE 
YOU'VE GOT TO COVER THEM IF THEY KEEP MOVING YOU'VE GOT TO COVER THEM ARRIVING 
FROM THE MOVE THEY'VE DONE BEFORE 
IT'S QUITE A COMPLEX JIGSAW PUZZLE AND IT HAS TO BE WORKED OUT 
THAT IS VERY TIME CONSUMING IT'S A NIGHTMARE 
GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT'S A WHODUNNIT IT COULDN'T BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN A BIG CAST 
WE KIND OF KNEW IT WAS A TRADITIONAL AGATHA CHRISTIE WHODUNNIT 
WE WANTED TO TAKE THE ESSENCE OF AGATHA CHRISTIE 
O. K. LET'S GO THEN PLEASE 
IT'S ESSENTIAL IN A WHODUNNIT YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ENSEMBLE CAST 
A BIG LARGE CAST FULL OF SUSPECTS 
AND ACTION 
GOOD AFTERNOON PROFESSOR PEACH 
FIRST YOU'VE GOT PROFESSOR PEACH I NEED TO CHECK SOMETHING IN THE LIBRARY OOH ALONE

SOME OF THESE YOUNG BOYS DESERVE A DECENT THRASHING 
COULDN'T AGREE MORE SIR 
WE HAD TO HAVE THE FLAPPER CHARACTER IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES 
MISS REDMOND SPIFFING TO MEET YOU AT LAST MY LADY 
MISS ROBINA EDMOND IS THERE THE CHARM OF THE LONDON SOCIETY 
SOCIALITE FUNNY WONDERFUL CLEVER 
ALSO STRANGELY HIDING A SECRET 
SO SHE LOOKS LIKE A SUSPECT EARLY ON BUT ACTUALLY IS HIDING 
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LAYER OF MOTIVES 
OH ALL RIGHT THEN IT'S A FAIR COP 
SHE'S A SCRUBBER FROM THE EAST END WHO'S STEALING EVERYBODY'S JEWELLERY 
GO ON THEN YOU NOBS 
ARREST ME 
MISS CHANDRAKALA WHO'S BEEN WITH THE FAMILY FOR A VERY LONG TIME 
LOOK SHARP WE HAVE GUESTS 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE FAITHFUL SERVANT WHO KNOWS WHERE THE BODIES ARE BURIED 
SHE'S BEEN IN THE HOUSEHOLD FOR YEARS AND KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON 
THE LIBRARY MURDER MURDER

YOU WON'T FIND ANYTHING IN THERE 
THEN REVEREND GOLIGHTLY OF COURSE 
AH REVEREND HOW ARE YOU

AS THE CHRISTIAN FATHERS TAUGHT ME WE MUST FORGIVE THEM THEIR TRESPASSES 
HE HAS THE BIGGEST SECRET OF THEM ALL HE TURNS INTO AN ALIEN WASP WHEN NOBODY'S LOOKING 
WHAT'S TO STOP ME KILLING YOU ALL 
THAT'S PROBABLY THE BIT YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY FIND IN A TRADITIONAL AGATHA CHRISTIE NOVEL 
A CAMERA ONLY 
THERE IS A MYSTERIOUS FOOTMAN IN DISGUISE CREEPING HIS WAY THROUGH THE GARDEN PARTY 
DRAWING ATTENTION TO HIMSELF BEAUTIFULLY 
BUT IS IN FACT DAVID TENNANT'S FATHER MAKING A CAMEO APPEARANCE 
FORTY NINE TAKE ONE 
I WAS COMING DOWN TO VISIT DAVID 
AND I THINK THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SHORT OF SOMEONE 
BUT THEY VERY KINDLY INVITED ME TO PLAY THE PART OF A FOOTMAN 
SIDECAR PLEASE AND A LIME AND SODA THANK YOU 
WHICH HAS BEEN INTERESTING AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO LEARN ANY LINES SO THAT WAS GOOD NEWS 
HELLO I'M THE DOCTOR HOW DO YOU DO 
MY LADY WHERE'S THIS SPECIAL GUEST YOU PROMISED US 
FINALLY THE FINAL GUEST YOU BRING IN IS AGATHA CHRISTIE HERSELF 
HERE SHE IS A LADY WHO NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION 
NO NO PLEASE DON'T 
MISS AGATHA CHRISTIE RUNNING AWAY FROM HER HUSBAND IN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX IN TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES 
THANK YOU LADY EDDISON HONESTLY THERE'S NO NEED 
FINDING HERSELF IN A SITUATION WHERE THE PATTERNS OF HER OWN BOOKS 
ARE REPEATING AROUND HER SO WHAT'S GOING ON 
AGATHA CHRISTIE WAS HARD TO CAST ACTUALLY VERY TOUGH 
ACTUALLY WE DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE 
IT WAS DAVID TENNANT WHO SUGGESTED FENELLA COS HE'D WORKED WITH HER IN BRIGHT YOUNG THINGS 
FENELLA WOOLGAR AS AGATHA CHRISTIE WAS MY IDEA THANK YOU 
I'D LIKE TO TAKE CREDIT FOR THAT 
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN I'LL SUGGEST I'VE KNOWN FENELLA FOR YEARS 
WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER A COUPLE OF TIMES 
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A BIG FAN OF HER 
WE GOT HER IN TO AUDITION AND SHE WAS PERFECT 
READ ONE LINE AND WE WENT THAT'S IT ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 
AGATHA CHRISTIE WHAT ABOUT HER 
THAT'S ME NO 
IT'S THE ONLY TIME I'VE MADE A SUGGESTION THEY'VE TAKEN UP 
I'M ALWAYS TRYING TO GET MY MATES ON THE SHOW NEVER HAPPENS 
AGATHA CHRISTIE I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU THE OTHER DAY 
I SAID I BET SHE'S BRILLIANT I'M THE DOCTOR THIS IS DONNA OH 
I LOVE YOUR STUFF WHAT A MIND 
FENELLA WOOLGAR WHO PLAYS AGATHA HAS A VERY INDIVIDUAL LOOK 
AND STRENGTH ABOUT HER AND AN INTELLIGENCE ABOUT HER 
YOU MAKE A RATHER UNUSUAL COUPLE 
WE'RE NOT A COUPLE WE'RE NOT MARRIED OBVIOUSLY NOT NO WEDDING RING 
OH OH YOU DON'T MISS A TRICK 
HER CLASS FEELS RIGHT FOR AGATHA 
FOR SOMEBODY WITH THAT KIND OF STRENGTH AT THAT TIME 
I'D STAY THAT WAY IF I WERE YOU THE THRILL IS IN THE CHASE NEVER IN THE CAPTURE 
SHE HAS A QUALITY WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY 
AND JUST ZONES IN ON NINETEEN TWENTY SIX AND THAT PERIOD SHE JUST HAS IT 
IS UM MR. CHRISTIE NOT JOINING US 
IS HE NEEDED CAN'T A WOMAN MAKE HER OWN WAY IN THE WORLD 
I'M VERY PROUD TO SAY THAT FENELLA WAS MY IDEA 
I'M GONNA KEEP REPEATING IT FENELLA WAS MY IDEA 
GOOD IDEA WASN'T IT YEAH 
YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO ME MORE FOR CASTING SUGGESTIONS I'M QUITE GOOD AT IT 
HOW LIKE A MAN TO HAVE FUN WHILE THERE'S DISASTER ALL AROUND HIM SORRY YEAH 
I'LL WORK WITH YOU GLADLY 
BUT FOR THE SAKE OF JUSTICE NOT YOUR OWN AMUSEMENT 
IT WAS A COMPLETE DREAM TO PLAY AGATHA CHRISTIE 
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 
IT WAS A DREAM BUT ALSO A POTENTIAL NIGHTMARE 
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SO MANY FANS OUT THERE 
AGATHA CHRISTIE I THINK IS THE BIGGEST SELLER AFTER THE BIBLE AND SHAKESPEARE SO NO PRESSURE 
YOU'VE WRITTEN SIMPLY THE BEST DETECTIVE STORIES 
AND ALSO HER GRANDSON WAS AT THE READ THROUGH WHICH WAS LIKE 
I KEPT TRYING TO SAY THIS IS THE FICTIONAL VERSION O. K. 
FENELLA HAD A DEGREE OF VULNERABILITY 
I'M AFRAID MY BOOKS WILL BE FORGOTTEN LIKE EPHEMERA 
AND INSECURITY WHICH I THINK 
PARTICULARLY AT THAT UNHAPPY PERIOD OF HER LIFE MY GRANDMOTHER DID HAVE 
AS SUCH I FOUND HER A CONVINCING PORTRAYAL OF THE ROLE 
I FOUND MY HUSBAND WITH ANOTHER WOMAN 
A YOUNGER PRETTIER WOMEN ISN'T IT ALWAYS THE WAY 
THE WHOLE IDEA OF AGATHA CHRISTIE COMES FROM OUR PRODUCER PHIL COLLINSON 
ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO WE WERE DRIVING FROM CARDIFF TO MANCHESTER 
HE SAID DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE IN DOCTOR WHO 
A MURDER MYSTERY STORY WITH AGATHA CHRISTIE IN IT 
THINK ABOUT IT THERE'S A MURDER A MYSTERY AND AGATHA CHRISTIE 
SO HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE TIME 
I LAUGHED FOR TWENTY MILES AND TEN MINUTES I JUST THOUGHT THAT WAS THE MOST BRILLIANT IDEA 
I JUST SAID RIGHT WE'LL DO IT 
THAT'S LIKE MEETING CHARLES DICKENS AND HE'S SURROUNDED BY GHOSTS AT CHRISTMAS WELL 
BUMPING INTO FIGURES FROM HISTORY IS ONE OF THE DOCTOR'S SPECIALTIES 
SOMETHING HE'S DONE EVER SINCE THE PROGRAMME'S CREATION WAY BACK WHEN IN THE WILLIAM HARTNELL YEARS 
HE'S PLANNING TO USURP MY CROWN AND TRADE WITH MY ENEMY PHILIP OF FRANCE 
THIS WAY LADIES GENTLEMEN 
THE DOCTOR HAS MET PRETTY MUCH EVERY MAIN PLAYER IN HISTORY 
LEONARDO 
EITHER ON SCREEN OR OFF 
THE PAINTINGS WENT DOWN VERY WELL 
IN THE COLIN BAKER ERA HE MET GEORGE STEPHENSON 
THIS VALVE'S THE PROBLEM YOUR INVENTION WILL TAKE OFF LIKE A ROCKET STEPHENSON 
HE'S GOT PROBABLY GOT A LIST SOMEWHERE AND IS TICKING THEM OFF 
I'LL EXPLAIN HOW IT WORKS LATER IT'S ALL RELATIVE 
WHEN IT COMES TO THE MODERN DAY SERIES IT'S SOMETHING I WANTED TO DO EVERY YEAR 
ROSE MIGHT I INTRODUCE HER MAJESTY QUEEN VICTORIA 
REMEMBER THE OLD DAYS REMEMBER THE OLD DAYS 
WHERE ARE WE WHEN ARE WE 
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT YEAR IT IS 
ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN 
STEP BACK IN TIME 
STEP BACK IN TIME 
DICKENS YES CHARLES DICKENS 
YES THE CHARLES DICKENS 
STEP BACK IN TIME 
I'M SUCH A BIG FAN 
HOW EXACTLY ARE YOU A FAN 
IN WHAT WAY DO YOU RESEMBLE A MEANS OF KEEPING ONESELF COOL 
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU 
I'M THE DOCTOR 
AND I JUST SNOGGED MADAME DE POMPADOUR HA HA HA 
EXCUSE ME NOT INTERRUPTING AM I MR. SHAKESPEARE ISN'T IT OH NO NO NO NO WHO LET YOU IN 
HOW MODERN 
NO AUTOGRAPHS NO YOU CAN'T HAVE YOURSELF SKETCHED WITH ME 
AND PLEASE DON'T ASK WHERE I GET MY IDEAS FROM 
STEP BACK IN TIME 
LET ME SAY GOODBYE TO YOU WITH A NEW VERSE 
A SONNET FOR MY DARK LADY 
QUEEN ELIZABETH I DOCTOR 
WISH ME LUCK 
OFF WITH HIS HEAD RUN 
SEE YA 
OOH 
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A FAMOUS HISTORICAL FIGURE TO PUT IN A STORY 
I AM THE QUEEN OF THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND 
IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A WRITER NECESSARILY 
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A WAY OF FRAMING THAT STORY 
AND AGATHA CHRISTIE ALLOWS YOU TO DO A LOVELY MURDER MYSTERY SET UP 
AGATHA CHRISTIE IS THE MOST POPULAR WRITER IN TERMS OF BOOK SALES OF ALL TIME 
I AM ONE OF YOUR GREATEST FOLLOWERS 
I'VE READ ALL SIX OF YOUR BOOKS 
UNLESS YOU COUNT THE BIBLE AND WHO KNOWS WHO WROTE THAT 
SO IT JUST SEEMED A BIG CLEAR TARGET TO DO 
OBVIOUS IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY 
IN USING AGATHA CHRISTIE YOU ALSO BRING IN THE WHOLE PASTICHE 
OF THE WHODUNNIT EVEN USING THINGS LIKE THE CLUEDO BOARD 
THE BODY IN THE LIBRARY 
I MEAN PROFESSOR PEACH IN THE LIBRARY WITH THE LEAD PIPING 
I'M NOT SURE AGATHA CHRISTIE EVER DID ACTUALLY DO A DEATH WITH LEAD PIPING 
WHAT IS LEAD PIPING I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT PIPES OR WHAT IT LEADS TO 
BUT IT'S THERE SO IT STARTS TO USE THAT WHOLE GENRE OF THINGS 
IT WAS YOU DONNA NOBLE 
WHAT WHO DID I KILL 
IT IS ALMOST A PARODY OF WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT FROM AGATHA CHRISTIE 
IT WAS YOU AGATHA CHRISTIE 
I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR 
THERE ARE TONS OF REFERENCES TO THE TITLES OF AGATHA CHRISTIE BOOKS IN THE SCRIPT 
MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS 
OH YEAH ONE OF YOUR BEST 
BUT NOT YET MARVELLOUS IDEA THOUGH 
MISS MARPLE WHO WRITES THOSE 
UM COPYRIGHT DONNA NOBLE ADD IT TO THE LIST 
IT WAS A CONTEST BETWEEN ME AND RUSSELL TO FIND WAYS OF PUTTING THEM IN THERE 
CARDS ON THE TABLE APPOINTMENT WITH DEATH 
CAT AMONG THE PIGEONS A DEAD MAN'S FOLLY 
ENDLESS NIGHT THEY DO IT WITH MIRRORS 
THE MOVING FINGER NEMESIS 
BODY IN THE LIBRARY SPARKLING CYANIDE 
DEATH COMES AS THE END 
CROOKED HOUSE MURDER AT THE VICAR'S RAGE 
NEEDS A BIT OF WORK 
INITIALLY WE WERE TORN ABOUT WHETHER TO MAKE AGATHA CHRISTIE 
THE YOUNG AGATHA CHRISTIE THAT WE HAVE WITH FENELLA OR AN OLDER AGATHA CHRISTIE 
IN ACTUAL FACT WE THOUGHT HOLD ON IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SET 
IN THE SIXTIES OR SEVENTIES AND THAT FEELS VERY WRONG 
IT SHOULD BE SET IN THE TWENTIES AND THAT TIES IN WITH HER FAMOUS DISAPPEARANCE 
WHICH WE WANTED TO ADDRESS RIGHT FROM THE START 
ACTUALLY IN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX AGATHA CHRISTIE DID ACTUALLY DISAPPEAR FOR 
A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF DAYS AND WAS LATER FOUND AT HARROGATE 
SHE'S DRIVEN OUT IN THIS CAR INTO THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE 
FOR ELEVEN DAYS SHE DISAPPEARS AND THEN SHE TURNS UP AT THIS SPA 
IT GIVES YOU SOMETHING NICE TO PLAY WITH FOR A DOCTOR WHO STORY WHAT HAPPENED THEN 
READ THE DATE ON THIS NEWSPAPER 
WHAT ABOUT IT IT'S THE DAY AGATHA CHRISTIE DISAPPEARED 
NOW MAMA AFTER YOU'VE GONE 
AND LEFT ME CRYIN' 
AFTER YOU'VE GONE 
THERE'S NO DENYIN' 
I THINK MY GRANDMOTHER'S DISAPPEARANCE IS THE ONLY EVENT 
THAT I HAVE READ OF AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME 
WHICH RIVALLED SOME MODERN DAY EVENTS IN THE EXTENT OF THE PUBLICITY THAT IT ATTRACTED 
THE COVERAGE WAS ABSOLUTELY ENORMOUS 
A LOT OF PEOPLE I FEAR THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A PUBLICITY STUNT 
ENGINEERED BY PUBLISHERS OR WHOEVER OR EVEN MAYBE MY GRANDMOTHER HERSELF 
TO PUBLICISE HER LATEST BOOK THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD 
IF YOU KNEW MY GRANDMOTHER YOU WOULD KNOW THAT SHE WAS INCAPABLE OF DREAMING UP A PUBLICITY STUNT 
SHE SPENT MOST OF HER LIFE AVOIDING PUBLICITY PARTICULARLY AFTER THIS EVENT 
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WILL KNOW THE EXACT TRUTH 
I DOUBT EVEN ALTHOUGH I NEVER DISCUSSED IT WITH HER 
EVEN MY GRANDMOTHER HERSELF REALLY KNEW THE TRUTH 
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SPECULATION ABOUT IT WHETHER SHE HAD A MEETING WHETHER SHE KNEW 
WHETHER IT WAS A BIT OF A BREAKDOWN WHETHER IT WAS PLANNED 
THERE'S ENDLESS REAMS OF CONJECTURE ABOUT IT 
THAT'S A PERFECT GAP FOR DOCTOR WHO TO SLIP IN AND SAY THIS IS WHAT REALLY HAPPENED 
SHE WAS FIGHTING A GIANT WASP OF COURSE 
BY ALL THAT'S HOLY 
WE HAD A LOT OF CHATS ABOUT HOW THE DOCTOR WHO STORY WOULD ENTER 
INTO THE AGATHA CHRISTIE STORY AND BRING THE TWO GENRES TOGETHER 
VESPIFORMS HAVE GOT HIVES IN THE SYLPHRAX GALAXY 
AGAIN YOU TALK LIKE EDWARD LEAR 
INITIALLY THERE WAS TALK OF SAUCERS ABDUCTING HER AND PROBING HER 
BUT IN THE END WE WENT FOR THE SIMPLEST OPTION WHICH WAS THAT WE'D PLAY A WHODUNNIT 
WE MUST LOOK FOR A MOTIVE USE ZE LITTLE GREY CELLS 
ABSOLUTELY A CLASSIC WHODUNNIT WITH ALL THE CLASSIC REASONS FOR KILLING 
AND ALL THE SUSPECTS EVERYTHING AS NORMAL BUT THE KILLER WAS A SHAPE SHIFTING ALIEN 
IT'S A GIANT WASP 
IT'S A GIANT WASP BECAUSE 
IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE OR SOMETHING I USED TO BUY AGATHA CHRISTIE BOOKS WHEN I WAS A KID COS I LOVED THEM 
MY MOTHER LOVED THEM SHE HAD THE PAPERBACKS 
AND I ALWAYS LOVED THIS DEATH IN THE CLOUDS PAPERBACK 
CHRISTIE AGATHA LOOK AT THAT 
WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG YOU THINK IT'S ABOUT AN AEROPLANE 
BEING ATTACKED BY A GIANT WASP IT'S SYMBOLIC 
THERE IS NO GIANT WASP WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT THAT WAS BUT I ALWAYS LOVED THAT COVER 
IT JUST CHIMED WITH ME FOR THIS STORY 
THE ENGLISH COUNTRY GARDENS TEA AND SCONES WASPS IN THE AIR 
THE GARDENS THE SUNSHINE IT JUST FITTED SOMEHOW 
I DON'T LIKE THEM VERY MUCH THEY'RE NOT MY FAVOURITE CREATURES 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN A GIANT WASP I MEAN A WASP THAT'S GIANT 
THEY'VE GOT THAT BUZZING VENGEFUL QUALITY 
IT WAS NICE TO CONTRAST THAT WITH THE IDENTITY OF THE HUMAN MURDERER 
HE FINDS OUT UM 
MUCH TO HIS AMAZEMENT THAT HE'S ACTUALLY A VESPIFORM 
LOOK AT ITS STING 
AND WHEN HE GETS VERY ANGRY IT'S ALL A BIT HULK GRRR 
WHEN HE GETS ANGRY QUIET 
THAT'S THE REVEREND GOLIGHTLY 
IT'S CHASING US 
OVER HERE COME AND GET ME REVEREND 
COME ON 
I KNEW I HAD TO GET THE VESPIFORM AWAY FROM THE HOUSE 
AND I KNEW I HAD TO GET AGATHA BY THAT LAKE AND AGATHA'S CAR ABANDONED THERE 
AND I KNEW THE WASP HAD TO BE DEALT WITH AT THE LAKE 
FIVE HUNDRED NINETY TAKE ONE B. CAMERA ONLY 
YOU CAN DEAL WITH A WASP BY SMACKING IT WITH A NEWSPAPER 
YOU CAN LET IT OUT OF THE WINDOW WHICH WASN'T AN OPTION 
AND ACTION 
OR YOU CAN SMEAR SOME HONEY AND MAKE A LITTLE HONEY TRAP THAT IT WILL FALL INTO AND DROWN IT 
HERE I AM THE HONEY IN THE TRAP 
COME TO ME VESPIFORM 
I'VE DONE ALL THREE AND THAT'S ONE OF MY FAVOURITES 
ITS MIND IS BASED ON HER THOUGHT PROCESSES THEY'RE LINKED 
QUITE SO DOCTOR IF I DIE 
THEN THIS CREATURE MIGHT DIE WITH ME 
DON'T HURT HER 
YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO BE LIKE THIS YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG TEMPLATE IN YOUR MIND IT'S NOT LISTENING 
AND CUT 
TONIGHT ON LOCATION AT THIS LAKESIDE THE ATMOSPHERE IS BUZZING 
FOR THE VESPIFORM'S FINAL MOMENTS THE VISUAL EFFECTS DEPARTMENT ARE HERE TO SPLASH OUT ON THE C. G. I. 
WHEN OUR C. G. I. VESPIFORM HITS THE WATER IT'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO 
CREATE THIS MASSIVE SPLASH BUT WE HAVEN'T GOT A PROP FOR THAT 
WE'RE GONNA DO THAT AS PURELY C. G. I. 
WHAT WE HAD TO DO WAS 
CONSTRUCT A SOLID SHAPE 
LIKE A GIANT WASP SHAPE 
AND THEN PLONK IT IN THE WATER 
SO THAT THE RIPPLE THAT IT MADE WAS EQUIVALENT TO AN EIGHT FOOT WASP HITTING THE WATER 
TAKE ME TO THE RIVER DROP ME IN THE WATER 
IDEALLY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IT SMASHING DOWN AT AN ANGLE 
IT'S GOING TO DIVE OR FLY OVER AGATHA THE DOCTOR AND DONNA'S HEADS 
WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO IS GET OUR BIG BLACK BAG 
SWINGING FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND AS IT'S SWINGING AT ITS MOST 
WE CUT THE WIRE AND IT HITS INTO THE WATER 
TAKE ME TO THE RIVER 
DROP ME IN THE WATER 
MAXIMUM YOU CAN GET KEITH 
ON YOU KEITH WE'RE SPEEDING 
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY 
NEXT ONE MAYBE 
ON DRY LAND AND BACK AT THE HOUSE THE MURDER MYSTERY CONTINUES 
AND IT'S LEFT A RATHER UNPLEASANT TASTE IN THE TIME LORD'S MOUTH 
IN THE KITCHENS TODAY THE CREW ARE COOKING UP THE SHOTS OF A POISONED DOCTOR 
WHAT DO WE DO WHAT DO WE DO 
I WOULD LIKE TO JUST SEE A LOAD OF STUFF GO FLYING THROUGH 
I CAN GRAB THAT KNOCK THEM OFF AND THEN I'M OUT 
AND ACTION 
WE WITNESS THE DOCTOR COMING IN AND EATING LOADS OF ANCHOVIES WALNUTS 
ONE TO FIFTY TAKE THREE C. CAMERA MARK ACTION 
GINGER BEER I BEG YOUR PARDON I NEED GINGER BEER 
THE GENTLEMAN HAS GONE MAD 
AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY MANIC 
HE MESSES UP HER KITCHEN SO SHE'S NOT IMPRESSED ACTION 
IT'S NOT JUST THE PROPS TAKING SOME PUNISHMENT 
THE DOCTOR'S TAILORING IS ALSO GETTING TROUNCED 
HE POURS WATER ALL OVER HIMSELF AS WELL AS DRINKS IT 
I'M AN EXPERT POISONS DOCTOR THERE IS NO CURE 
OF COURSE THEN THE SUIT IS DESTROYED 
IF YOU THEN WANT TO GO BACK TO AN EARLIER MOMENT YOU NEED TWO SUITS 
ACTION GINGER BEER 
WE'D ALL AGREE IF THERE'S A MOMENT BEFORE THE CHAOS 
AND IT GOES WRONG ANYBODY CAN YELL OUT CUT DON'T LET'S GET THAT SUIT DESTROYED 
CUT CUT CUT WHOOH 
CUT CUT CUT CUT THANK YOU SAVED THE SUIT 
THANK YOU ONE MORE ONE MORE 
WE GOT THROUGH BOTH SUITS YES WE DESTROYED IT BECAUSE I WANTED TO GO AGAIN FROM THE BEGINNING 
TAKE FOUR AND ACTION 
I'M AN EXPERT IN POISONS DOCTOR THERE IS NO CURE IT'S FATAL NOT TO ME 
I WANTED THE DOCTOR TO BE POISONED AND 
IMMEDIATELY THAT SET ME THINKING ABOUT HOW THE DOCTOR WOULD REACT TO BEING POISONED 
I CAN STIMULATE THE INHIBITED ENZYMES INTO REVERSAL PROTEIN I NEED PROTEIN 
HE'S GOT A DIFFERENT BODY CHEMISTRY TO US 
HE KNOWS A LOT MORE ABOUT CHEMISTRY THEM WE KNOW 
HE WOULD KNOW WHAT KIND OF THINGS HE COULD FIND IN A KITCHEN TO USE TO CURE HIMSELF 
WALNUTS BRILLIANT 
I ALSO REALISED THAT LED TO POTENTIAL FOR DONNA TO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON 
CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU 
TO REACH FOR THE WRONG THINGS TO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS SAYING THROUGH MOUTHFULS OF FOOD 
HOW MANY WORDS ONE WORD 
MILKSHAKE MILK NO NOT MILK 
SHAKE SHAKE UM COCKTAIL SHAKER WHAT DO YOU WANT A HARVEY WALLBANGER 
HARVEY WALLBANGER WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW IS HARVEY WALLBANGER ONE WORD 
WHAT DO YOU NEED DOCTOR SALT I WAS MIMING SALT 
I NEED SOMETHING SALTY 
WHAT ABOUT THIS WHAT IS IT SALT THAT'S TOO SALTY OH THAT'S TOO SALTY 
WHAT ABOUT THIS MM WHAT'S THAT 
ANCHOVIES WHAT IS IT WHAT ELSE 
IT'S A SONG MAMMY 
I THINK RUSSELL SEES IT AS ESSENTIAL 
THAT EVERY COMPANION AND THE DOCTOR HAVE A BIT OF A KISS OF SOME DESCRIPTION 
SHOCK I NEED SHOCK I NEED SHOCK 
IT'S BECOME A LAW OF MODERN DOCTOR WHO 
COS PEOPLE LOVE A BIT OF THAT DON'T THEY THEY LOVE TO SPECULATE ON IT 
RIGHT THEN BIG SHOCK COMING UP 
OF COURSE AS USUAL IT'S NOT REALLY A KISS IT'S SOMETHING ELSE 
DETOX OH AH I MUST DO THAT MORE OFTEN 
BUT IT'S GOOD ISN'T IT IT'S FUN SHOVE THESE THINGS IN KEEP YOU GUESSING 
I MEAN THE THE DETOX AND CUT 
LOOK WHO'S COMING TO DINNER 
IT'S THE PRINCIPAL ARTISTS OF COURSE 
AND EACH OF THEM HAS AN APPOINTMENT WITH DEATH 
IT'S A MOODY SETTING 
WHERE THE MENU ALWAYS OFFERS THE POSSIBILITY OF POISON 
I WANTED IT TO BE CREEPY 
A RATHER TENSE EDGY SCENE IN WHICH THE AUDIENCE KNOWS 
SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN ANY MINUTE SOMEBODY ELSE IS GOING TO DIE 
IT'S A DARK CLIMAX 
IT RELIES HEAVILY ON THE SKILLS OF THE LIGHTING AND CAMERA CREW 
THE CHARACTERS ARE HAVING A CANDLELIT DINNER 
AND THE VESPIFORM BREAKS IN THROUGH THE WINDOW 
AND BLOWS OUT ALL THE CANDLES 
SO WHAT I HAD TO DO WAS LIGHT IT WARMLY AS THOUGH IT WAS LIT BY CANDLES 
A TERRIBLE DAY FOR ALL OF US 
AND THEN THE CANDLES GET BLOWN OUT SO WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE LIGHT INTO A NIGHT TIME EFFECT 
A MOONLIGHT EFFECT LIGHT COMING FROM A DIFFERENT DIRECTION 
AS THE WINDOWS ARE BURST OPEN BY THE VESPIFORM WE INTRODUCED THE FLASHING LIGHTNING EFFECT 
THE CREW ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY CREATING CANDLELIGHT MAKING MOONLIGHT 
AND THEN THEY WILL LET RIP WITH THE LIGHTNING 
ONE TWO THREE 
AND ACTION 
A TERRIBLE DAY FOR ALL OF US 
THE PROFESSOR STRUCK DOWN MISS CHANDRAKALA CRUELLY TAKEN FROM US 
IT IS DIFFICULT THIS ONE YOU REALISE WHY IT MUST TAKE SO LONG TO DO A MISS MARPLE OR A POIROT 
AND CUT THANK YOU IF ALL YOU DO IS SHOOT THE VICAR YOU KNOW THE VICAR DUNNIT 
SO YOU'VE GOT TO SHOOT EVERYONE WHICH MEANS THAT EVERYONE GOES INTO A SLIGHT PANIC 
EVERYTHING IS ALL HUSHED EVERYONE'S LIKE WE'VE A LOT TO COVER TODAY WE'VE GOT AT LEAST TWELVE PEOPLE 
WE NEED A MID SHOT AND A CLOSE UP OF THE LOT OF THEM OTHERWISE YOU'LL KNOW WHO DID IT 
SO IT'S QUITE WEIRD THAT IT PUTS QUITE A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THE CREW 
EVERYONE HAS TO WORK REALLY FAST GOT TO GET IT ALL DONE VERY QUICKLY 
AND ACTION 
ANY ONE OF YOU HAD THE CHANCE TO PUT CYANIDE IN MY DRINK 
TWO CAMERAS WERE ROLLING ALL THE TIME 
I SAID WHATEVER HAPPENS NEVER STOP PERFORMING 
ALWAYS STAY IN CHARACTER BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THAT CAMERA 
IS GOING TO BE ON YOU OR YOU'LL BE IN THE BACKGROUND 
EVEN IF YOU'RE OUT OF FOCUS I CAN STILL READ WHAT YOU'RE THINKING 
WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO PORTRAY AT THAT MOMENT 
IT ENABLES ME TO BUILD UP A HUGE PORTFOLIO OF ALL SORTS OF REACTIONS AND LOOKS 
THAT WILL EITHER GIVE YOU AWAY OR MAKE PEOPLE THINK IT'S NOT THEM 
IT RATHER GAVE ME AN IDEA AND WHAT WOULD THAT BE 
WELL POISON 
DRINK UP 
I HAVE LACED THE SOUP WITH PEPPER 
AH I THOUGHT IT WAS JOLLY SPICY 
BUT THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT OF PEPPER IS PIPERINE 
TRADITIONALLY USED AS AN INSECTICIDE 
OH ANYONE GOT THE SHIVERS 
AND CUT VERY GOOD THANK YOU ALL THANK YOU ALL 
LADIES AND GENTS AS WE GET TO THE END OF THIS SEQUENCE 
I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE IT UP TO FLASH OF LIGHT AND THE LIGHTS GO OUT 
FLASH OF LIGHT AND THE WINDOW CRASHES OPEN SO I GET EVERYBODY TRYING TO LOOK TOWARDS THE WINDOW 
THE LIGHTS GO OUT WINDOWS CRASH OPEN CANDLES ARE BLOWN OUT 
THEY ARE MAKING LIGHT WORK OF IT BUT IT IS NO MEAN FEAT 
ANYONE GOT THE SHIVERS 
BANG 
IT'S A QUESTION OF GETTING ALL THESE LIGHTS IN SYNC AND PERFECT TIMING 
BANG 
AND MAKING CERTAIN IT'S ALL TIED IN TOGETHER AT THE RIGHT TIME THE RIGHT PLACE 
REGARDING THE SCRIPT REGARDING REACTION TO THE ACTORS AND SO FORTH 
AND 
ACTION I LACED THE SOUP WITH PEPPER 
AH I THOUGHT IT WAS JOLLY SPICY 
I'M READING THE SCRIPT FROM WHAT'S CALLED SIDES 
FIRING THE LIGHTNING FROM A DETONATOR 
ANYONE GOT THE SHIVERS 
BANG 
BIT OF PRACTICE AND A BIT OF PREPARATION AND A BIT OF LUCK LIFTS IT TOGETHER 
WHAT THE DEUCE IS THAT LISTEN LISTEN LISTEN 
WHAT I WANTED TO GET OUT OF IT WAS TENSION THE EDGE 
NO IT CAN'T BE 
A VERY FAST ACTION MOMENT 
WHERE WE DISCOVER EVENTUALLY SOMEONE HAS DIED 
SHOW YOURSELF DEMON 
SHOW YOURSELF DEMON SHE IS AWARE OF THE ATMOSPHERE A SPURT OF SOMETHING 
SHOW YOURSELF DEMON NOW PEOPLE THAT MAKES PEOPLE TERRIFIED 
AND YOU START TO WALK AWAY AND WHATEVER 
SO SHOW YOURSELF DEMON OH I DON'T LIKE THIS YOU GO RUNNING AWAY STAY WHERE YOU ARE 
NOW IT STARTS TO RISE UP NOW YOU START TO GO OH MY GOD YES 
OUT AND THAT'S IT 
PANIC AND CHAOS ENSUES OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE NONE OF US 
HAS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE 
NOBODY MOVE 
STAY WHERE YOU ARE 
YOU SEE THE VESPIFORM YOU SEE THIS WASP 
SUDDENLY APPEAR AND RISE UP INTO THE HEAVENS IN THIS HUGE DINING ROOM 
YOU DON'T SEE WHO CHANGED AND WHO BECAME THE WASP ETC 
YOU SEE THEM ALL RUNNING AROUND 
EVEN AT THE TIME WHEN THE WASP STARTS TO MAKE ITS SOUND 
OUT OUT OUT OUT 
SO WHOEVER IT WAS WAS ACTUALLY RUNNING AROUND AND WAS ACTUALLY MAKING THAT SOUND BUT WHO WAS IT 
WELL OF COURSE WE NOW KNOW IT WAS THE REVEREND 
HALF THE SCENE I'M THE REVEREND GOLIGHTLY THE OTHER HALF HE'S TURNED INTO A WASP 
YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST A GIANT INSECT FLYING AROUND THE ROOM 
FUN FOR ME THOUGH I CAN HEAR THEM ALL RUNNING AWAY FROM ME AND I'M SITTING HERE TALKING TO YOU 
NOT YOU AGATHA YOU'VE GOT A LONG LIFE TO LEAD YET 
WELL WE KNOW THE BUTLER DIDN'T DO IT WHO DID 
ACTION 
THEN LATER ON I GET KNIFED IN THE BACK 
MY CHILD 
IT WAS JUST CRANKING UP THE SUSPENSE YOU KNOW 
MAKING EACH MURDER AS DIFFERENT AS POSSIBLE FROM THE LAST ONE SO 
HEAVENS WE HAVE THE LEAD PIPING WITH THE PROFESSOR AT THE BEGINNING NO 
HE DISCOVERS WHAT IS GOING ON HE DISCOVERS THE FAMILY TREE SO THE REVEREND HAS TO SHUT HIM UP 
MISS CHANDRAKALA BEING CRUSHED BY THE STATUE 
SHE HAS BEEN WITH LADY EDDISON AND IS ONE OF THE FEW WHO KNOWS HER SECRET 
SHE MEET A STICKY END AS WELL 
ROGER IS THE ONE WHO WOULD HAVE INHERITED EVERYTHING FROM THE CURBISHLEY AND EDDISON ESTATES 
SO HE IS KNOCKED OFF BECAUSE THE REVEREND FEELS ROBBED OF HIS INHERITANCE 
HE'S HAD A MODEST QUIET POOR LIFE ACTUALLY 
THESE PEOPLE HAVE THIS VAST ESTATE AND THEY SHOULD ALL BE HIS HE IS CLAIMING HIS BIRTHRIGHT 
CUT CUT I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR EAR CAN WE PLUG IT 
I THINK THAT'S IT DO YOU YES GREAT 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL THANK YOU GUYS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE EXTRA TIME FOLKS REALLY REALLY GOOD 
I FEEL A LITTLE TIRED ER 
UM I THINK I COULD DO WITH A MASSAGE MAYBE A SAUNA 
AS TWO VINTAGE VEHICLES TOOTLE ON TO SET 
COMPLETING THE SHOOT LOOKS LIKELY TO BE A BUMPY RIDE FOR THE CAST 
DAVID AND FENELLA HAVE JUST A FEW HOURS TO GET TO GRIPS WITH THESE CLASSIC CARS 
BEFORE FILMING THE CLIMACTIC CHASE SEQUENCE 
IT'S EXCITING JUST BECAUSE IT'S FUN TO DRIVE THESE THINGS 
AT THE SAME TIME YOU ARE ALWAYS AWARE THAT THE OWNER OF THE CAR IS USUALLY THERE 
LOOKING AT YOU VERY BEADILY 
BECAUSE THESE CARS ARE BY THEIR VERY NATURE QUITE RARE AND THEREFORE QUITE EXPENSIVE 
IT'S A MORRIS COWLEY BUILT IN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX 
THE ACCELERATOR IS IN THE MIDDLE 
THEY DIDN'T STANDARDISE UNTIL THE END OF THE TWENTIES SO YOU NEED TO 
WHEN YOU JUMP IN THE CAR YOU KNOW SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT 
BUT YOU NEED TO CONCENTRATE ON THAT COS THE BRAKE IS ON THE RIGHT 
IT'S A DIFFERENT SORT OF DRIVING EXPERIENCE AND IF YOU'RE NOT USED TO IT 
YOU ARE AWARE THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE BLOWING THE ENGINE OR DESTROYING THE GEARBOX 
SO SECOND IS LIKE THIRD AND THIRD IS LIKE FOURTH 
O. K. AND REVERSE IS LIKE FIRST IT'S ALL GOING SO WELL 
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT YOU'RE MEANT TO DO THIS DOUBLE DECLUTCHING THING 
WE JUST CHANGED OUR CAR FOR AN AUTOMATIC SO IT'S EVEN MORE STRESSFUL FOR ME 
O. K. SO THAT'S FIRST WHERE'S SECOND REVERSE IS STRAIGHT UP 
REVERSE IS STRAIGHT UP YES OH 
ACCELERATOR'S IN THE MIDDLE REVERSE IS STRAIGHT UP EASY PEASY 
NINETEEN TWENTY SIX CARS DOING A CAR CHASE IS NOT EASY 
CAN YOU MAKE IT WHEN I SAY QUICK GETAWAY 
I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT'S POSSIBLE 
AS A DIRECTOR YOU WANNA GO I JUST WANT A SHOT YOU START THE ENGINE 
THE NEXT THING IS WE CUT TO WHEELS SPINNING THEN THEY FLY OFF 
WELL OLD VINTAGE CARS DON'T HAVE WHEELS SPINNING 
LOVELY THAT'LL DO 
HERE WE ARE WITH A DICK BARTON TYPE OF CHASE WITH TWO CARS THAT CAN'T GO 
MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE M. P. H. SO IT WAS HELL OF A CHASE 
OH 
I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT IT AND DISSECT IT THE MUSIC'S DOING THE PACE FOR YOU 
THE ACTION THE DOCTOR'S DOING 
THE FAST ACTION HE'S DOING RUNNING TO THE CAR GETTING IN THE CAR 
LETTING THE BRAKE GO 
THE TIGHTNESS AND FAST CUTTING YOU DO GIVES YOU THE PACE 
THE LAKE SHE'S HEADING FOR THE LAKE 
CUT 
I THINK YOU GET AWAY WITH IT 
ALL RIGHT IT'S A CHASE A TWENTY M. P. H. THAT'S WHAT IT IS 
RIGHT NOW WE'RE ALL O. K. WE'RE IN NEUTRAL I JUST PRESS THAT HARD AND THAT'S IT IS THAT RIGHT 
I THINK SO 
OH YES OH YES 
EXCELLENT RIGHT WHAT AM I DOING 
WE WERE SLIGHTLY STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH NELLY JUST BECAUSE HER CAR'S FASTER THAN YOURS 
I WENT FASTER THAN I REALISED WE WERE HEATING I DID IT IN ONE TAKE DIDN'T I 
I DID I DID IT IN ONE TAKE ONE GO WAY TO GO 
MAYBE I CAN GO UP INTO THIRD 
ON THE SLOPE EARLIER THAT'S WHEN IT DIED SO I WAS TRYING TO KEEP IT GOING I'LL SLOW IT DOWN A BIT 
HELLO 
I COULD GET IT GOING BUT IT DIDN'T HAVE MUCH SPEED 
IT DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF POKE TO IT 
OF COURSE INEVITABLY WHEN YOU'RE FILMING THERE'S A CAMERA CAR SOMEWHERE AS WELL 
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO STAY A CERTAIN DISTANCE IN FRONT OF THEM SO THAT THEY CAN GET A SHOT 
THAT'S DIFFICULT IN A MODERN CAR BUT WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING SOMETHING 
YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THE CONTROL YOU WISH FOR IT CAN BE A DIFFICULT 
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE GOING UP HILLS AND THE ENGINE JUST DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW 
WE'RE DRIVING A SEWING MACHINE BEHIND YOU 
I'M SORRY DAVID AM I SHOWING YOU UP A LITTLE BIT 
IT'S NOT ME IT'S THE ENGINEERING 
ARE YOU SURE THE ENGINEERING OF PAST AGES 
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT LADY DRIVERS DAVID WHAT 
WHAT WAS THAT DAVID'S CAR GOES ON THE LOW LOADER PLEASE AH 
AH YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH CLEARLY 
I'M DRIVING YOU ON THE LOW LOADER 
THERE'S NO MORE DRIVING FOR DAVID AS THE CAR IS SECURED TO THE CAMERA TRUCK 
AND THEN I WAS ABLE TO DO TIGHT WORK ON DOCTOR AND DONNA OR TIGHT WORK ON AGATHA 
THERE'S A MOMENT WHEN SHE'S SAYING 
IT'S ALL MY FAULT IT'S ALL MY FAULT 
ALL THOSE MOMENTS NEED TO BE REALLY WELL SHOT 
CLASSICALLY CLEANLY AND IN FOCUS 
ACTION TIME IS IN FLUX DONNA 
FOR ALL WE KNOW THIS IS THE NIGHT AGATHA CHRISTIE LOSES HER LIFE 
AND HISTORY GETS CHANGED WHERE'S SHE GONE 
THE LAKE SHE'S HEADING FOR THE LAKE 
I ENJOYED IT AND I DIDN'T BLOW IT UP I DIDN'T BREAK IT WHICH IS ALWAYS A PLUS 
THE LIBRARY 
THE LIBRARY IS THE BIGGEST LIBRARY IN THE UNIVERSE 
THEY'RE ALWAYS A BIT SHADOWY A BIT OTHER WORLDLY 
AND THE DUST IN THE SUNBEAMS IT SUDDENLY RESONATED HOW SCARY THIS EPISODE IS 
WHAT IF THE DARKNESS ITSELF COULD GET YOU 
THIS IS ABOUT DARKNESS THIS IS THE DARKNESS STORY 
THIS IS WHERE THE DARKNESS GETS YOU
