CARTER HE GOT OFF TO A FLYING 
START A BREAK OF NINETY SEVEN WAS BROUGHT TO

EIGHTY TWO TO ZERO LEAD WITH HELP FROM THIS 
OUTRAGEOUS FLUKE YORKSHIRE BASED 
MURPHY ONE VIKTOR P. C. THIRD FRAME 
CARTER'S BREAK OF FIFTY SIX WAS ENOUGH TO 
GIVE HIM A LEAD AT THE INTERVAL

REDUCED TO FOUR TO TWO BREAKS OF FORTY FIVE AND FORTY ONE 
GAVE CARTER A FIVE TO TWO LEAD A CENTURY 
IN THE FINAL SESSIONS SEES HIM IN 
COMMAND WHAT ABOUT STEPHEN 
HENDRY'S FORTUNES AS HE BIDS TO 
MAKE IT TO RECORD SEVENTEENTH CRUCIBLE 
FINAL IN SEVENTEEN YEARS IS THAT SO 
INCREDIBLE WED THE SCOT IS 
CONCERNED THE BOOKIES DID NOT 
FANCY HIS CHANCES THEY MADE DING 
JUNHUI A BE FAVOURITE DING 
JUNHUI JOHN VIRGO AND DENNIS 
TAYLOR ARE THERE HE PLAYED IT WELL 
IT WILL BE A BONUS IF HE IS ON THE 
PINK HE WAS ON IT HE IS FIFTY THREE BEHIND AND SIXTY SEVEN REMAINING 
THE YELLOW BY THE CUSHION IS A 
LITTLE BIT OF INSURANCE THIS IS A BIG ASK 
I HAVE A FEELING THE BLUE DOES NOT 
GO UP TO THE RIGHT MIDDLE HE HAD A 
LOOK AT IT WHEN HE POTTED HIS 
OPENING RED IF IT DOES GO YOU 
WOULD PLAY FOR THE BLUE 
IT OBVIOUSLY DOES NOT IF IT DID 
HE WOULD HAVE PLAYED FOR IT DO NOT 
TUMMY HE HAS PLAYED FOR THE BLUE 
IN THE MIDDLE DENNIS TO HELP ME 
HOW BAD HAS HE HIT THAT TELL ME 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF POINTS 
AVAILABLE HE DID NOT HAVE TO TAKE 
A HIGH VALUE COLOUR 
BACK WAS A 
FANTASTIC SHOT TO RELEASE THE 
YELLOW THAT'S ISN'T THAT 
TYPICAL SNOOKER IT CAME UP FOR HIM 
NOW A CHANCE TO WIN THE FRAME WHAT 
A BIG FRAME THIS IS FOR THIS YOUNG 
MAN IT IS A BIG FRAME 
STRAIGHTER WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER 
THEN HE COULD HAVE JUST ROLLED THE 
RED IN AND POSSIBLY GOT THE YELLOW 
BACK ON TO ITS SPOT AS WELL HE HAS 
A LITTLE BIT TO DO HE IS LOOKING 
AT THE SCOREBOARD 
IT IS NOT THE EASIEST SHOT TO POT 
THE COLOUR AND GET GOOD POSITION ON 
THE YELLOW 
HE LOOKS TO BE PRETTY STRAIGHT ON 
THE BROWN 
THAT IS WHY HE HAS ELECTED TO TAKE 
THE GREEN 
HE HAS GONE CLOSE TO THE CUSHION 
IS THE IN OFF ON TO THE CORNER 
POCKET WHAT DO YOU THINK 
IT IS A 
POSSIBLE 
IF HE MISSES THE BROWN THIS IS 
INCH PERFECT TREMENDOUS SHOT 
THIS COULD BE A BIT OF A TURNING 
POINT IF HE CAN CLEAR THESE UP INCH PERFECT ON THE BLUE 
THIS IS A BIG FRAME 
HE IS SHOWING 
A LOT OF CHARACTER THAT WAS VERY WELL PLAYED 
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT HE KNOWS THAT 
STEPHEN HENDRY BUT NOT MISS THE 
BLACK WOULD 
HAVE LET STEPHEN HAVE GO AT THE BLACK HIS FIFTY ONE 
BREAK PROVED ENOUGH THE MISS ON 
THE BLACK COME UP WHAT FRAME TO 
LOSE NINE TO TWO FOR STEPHEN 
HENDRY THE BLACK WHAT A FRAME 
HE IS THE ONE WHO HAS WON FIVE OF 
THE PREVIOUS MEETINGS INTO THE 
NEXT FRAME WE GO KNOW WHAT NO 
THAT WAS DISAPPOINTING FOR US TO HE 
NEVER GOT IT NEAR ENOUGH 
INDIVIDUALS DISAPPOINTING HE IS 
GOING TO NEED A RED AND A COLOUR 
HE MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE HE COULD 
SCREW BACK AND DISLODGE THE ONE RED 
THAT HE NEEDS IT ALL DEPENDS ON 
THE ANGLE 
MAYBE HE COULD NOT SURELY HE IS 
NOT LOOKING AT THREE BALL PLANT 
YOU CANNOT BEAT A THREE BALL PLANT 
CAN YOU 
IS THERE ANOTHER PLANT TO BEAT 
OTHER CORNER POCKET HE HAS PLAYED 
IT IT IS IN WELCOME TO GARDENERS' 
WORLD 
THAT WAS A COUPLE OF WORLD DELIGHTFUL PLANT IF HE POTS THE 
YELLOW HE HAS GOT A ONE BALL PLANT 
ON JOHN 
THE YELLOW DID NOT GOING 
THAT WILL NOT MATTER STEPHEN 
HENDRY SEEMS TO BE RUNNING AWAY 
WITH THIS AT THE MOMENT FOOT HE HAS 
PLAYED FOUR FRAMES IN THIS SESSION 
AND HAS WON ALL OF THEM AT THE 
MOMENT SOME VERY CUTE PLAY FROM 
HENDRY TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD DING FINALLY 
GAVE US A GLIMPSE OF HIS ABILITIES 
HE HAS REDUCED HIS ARREARS TO SEVEN 
FRAMES IT IS DING TO PLAY HE HAS PLAYED IT WELL 
JUST A SLIGHT KICK THE REFEREE IS 
CLEANING THE WHITE IT DID NOT 
MATTER IT STRAIGHTENED IT SLIGHTLY 
HE PLAYED THE CANNON HE HAS GOT A 
FORTY SEVEN POINT LEAD AT THE MOMENT 
THE YOUNG MAN HE'S DIGGING IN 
EVERY CREDIT 
I AM SO PLEASED TO 
SEE IT 
WHEN HE GETS IN HE IS TAKING HIS 
CHANCES IT IS A LONG WAY BACK A 
COUPLE MORE FRAMES TO PLAY IF 
SOMEHOW HE COULD GET TO TEN TO SIX COME 
UP WE COULD HAVE A MATCH ON OUR 
HANDS TOMORROW TEN TO SIX WE COULD 
HAVE 
STEVE DAVIS WAS EIGHT TO THREE BEHIND AGAIN IS 
TO STUART BINGHAM HE GOT BACK TO 
AT EIGHTY EIGHT HE LOST THE NEXT FRAME ON 
THE BLACK 
OTHERWISE STEVE DAVIS WOULD STILL 
HAVE BEEN IN THIS YEAR'S 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
WHEN HE WAS PLAYING THE BLACK I 
WAS THINKING BACK TO A FRAME 
EARLIER THIS EVENING WHEN HE NEEDED 
EIGHT BLACK FOR THE FRAME 
NO CENTURY BUT ANOTHER BEAUTIFULLY 
COMPILED BREAK 
THAT HE IS HIS SECOND HIGHEST BREAK 
OF THE MATCH THAT IS HIS 
HIGHEST WAS IN THE LAST FRAME 
WE WILL HAVE A SESSION TOMORROW 
DING JUNHUI IS DIGGING IN THAT WAS 
HIS HIGHEST BREAK OF THE MATCH HE 
STILL TRAILS BY TEN FRAMES TO FOUR 
COULD EIGHT CHINA CRISIS BE 
AVERTED 
HE HAS PLAYED THAT ABSOLUTELY INCH 
PERFECT IF HE POTS THE BLUE AND 
CANNONS ON THE BLACK IT MAY BE 
WORTH A RISK HE DECIDED NOT TO 
YOU FEEL HE WILL HAVE A JOB WINNING 
THE FRAME WITH JUST THE BLUE TO GO 
AT 
HE NEEDED TO MISS THE COLOURS AND 
HE HAS THERE IS ONE AROUND TO THE 
PINK SPOT AREA AROUND THE PINK 
SPOT AREA IT IS EIGHT TOUGH ONE 
WITH THE REST 
HE IS ON THE PINK BUT THE PINK WILL 
HAVE TO GO ON THE BROWN SPOT BUT 
HE COULD GO INTO DONE REDS AND 
BLACK FROM THE ANGLE BUT HE HAS 
HERE THAT HE HAS HERE 
HE OVERDID IT HE HAS STILL GOT A 
POT ON BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT HE 
ATTEMPTED 
YES LUCKY TO HAVE THIS RED 
AVAILABLE 
IT IS NOT TOO BAD EVEN IF HE GETS 
THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BLUE BECAUSE 
HE HAS A RED ADJACENT TO THE RIGHT 
HAND SIDE POCKET THAT HE CAN PLAY 
ON 
THIS RED IS CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE 
POCKET THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT HIM TO 
GET IT 
HE PLAYED IT WELL 
HAS HE GOT 
ENOUGH ANGLE TO GET INTO THE TWO 
REDS AT THE RIGHT OF THE BUNCH OF 
REDS HE WILL HAVE RELEASED THE 
BLACK ALSO IF HE GETS THIS CANNON 
YOU FEEL THAT THERE IS ONE GOOD 
POSITIONAL SHOT NEEDED HERE THE 
REDS ARE WELL SPREAD 
HE GOT A GOOD LINE AND A GOOD 
LENGTH 
THIS REALLY IS A FIRST LENGTH CLASS PERFORMANCE TO BATTLE BACK 
LIKE THIS BREAKS OF NINETY THREE AND NINETY FOUR 
ALTHOUGH HE DOES NOT LIKE WATCHING 
THIS I AM SURE STEPHEN HENDRY WILL 
HAVE ADD BIT OF ADMIRATION FOR THIS 
FIGHT BACK 
AT TEN TWO BEHIND YOU WOULD HAVE 
TO SAY DING AND WAS PLAYING FOR HIS 
PRIDE 
IT PROVES THAT IN THIS GAME OF 
SNOOKER YOU DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING 
FOR GRANTED STEPHEN HENDRY SEEMED 
TO JUST BE TAKING FRAME AFTER FRAME 
BUT AFTER THE MID SESSION INTERVAL 
DING JUNHUI HAS COME OUT WITH A 
COMPLETELY FOCUSED MIND THOUGHT 
HE MIGHT COME OUT AND JUST TRIED TO 
POT ANYTHING THAT HE COULD SEE AND 
GO OUT WITH ALL GUNS BLAZING BUT 
HE HAS PLAYED CONTROLLED SNOOKER 
AND WHEN HE HAS GOT IN HE HAS 
SCORED HEAVILY 
NO JUST LOOKING FOR ONE MORE RED TO 
CONTINUE THE COME BACK NOW HE DID NOT QUITE SECURE THE FRAME 
COULD HE PINCH THIS FRAME 
HE HAS 
GIVEN HIMSELF EVERY CHANCE WITH 
THAT AT STANDING LONG RED OUT 
STANDING 
HE REALISES THAT DING IS GETTING 
HIS CONFIDENCE AND THIS WOULD BE A 
REAL BODY BLOW TO THE YOUNG MAN 
FROM CHINA IT STEPHEN COULD TAKE 
THIS FRAME 
HE HAD TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO GO INTO 
THE MIDDLE POCKET 
THE OPENING RED AT THE START OF 
THIS BREAK WAS A SHOT GOOD ENOUGH 
TO WIN ANY FRAME HE HAS AT BIC 
LEAD BUT DING WAS GOING ALONG VERY 
NICELY A. P. KHALID HE HAS BEAK LEAD IN IT GOES SAFETY 
IN THE 
INJURY 
WAS JUST ONE POT AWAY BUT HE WILL 
SIT THERE REFLECTING ON WHAT MIGHT 
HAVE BEEN STEPHEN HENDRY NOTE LEAD 
BY SEVEN 
IN THE LAST OF THE 
SESSION ANOTHER BREAK OF NINETY FOUR 
DEMONSTRATED REAL CHARACTER FROM 
THE DING STILL AN AWFUL LOT TO DO 
THEY WILL COME BACK TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON STEPHEN HENDRY NEEDS 
JUST TWO MORE IN ORDER TO PROGRESS 
NOW MIGRATED THE LAST OF OUR FOUR 
CRUCIBLE KING'S ON SHOW PETER 
EBDON FOUND HIMSELF UP AGAINST MARK 
KING WHO SENT MARK SELBY PACKING 
EARLIER THIS WEEK EBDON'S IT NINE TO SIX 
ADVANTAGE BECAME IT TWELVE TO NINE THIS 
EVENING 
ANOTHER AMBITIOUS 
SHOT COMING UP 
WHEN YOU ARE IMPARTING THAT MIGHT 
SIDE IT IS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE BE 
MAKE OF CONTACT THE AMOUNT OF 
CONTACT 
A CHANCE MISSED IT 
COULD BE VERY COSTLY THE BLACK IS 
TIED UP FOR THE MOMENT BUT THEN I 
ENOUGH POT A BALL REDS THERE ARE 
ENOUGH REDS THAT WILL POT FOR EBDON 
TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS 
HE COULD HAVE CANNONED INTO THE RED 
JUST ABOVE THE PINK SPOT WELL DONE 
MAYBE HE SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY AS 
A CHANCE TO CLINCH FRAME AND MATCH 
MAYBE HE CAN SEE THIS OPPORTUNITY 
THE EXTRA DIFFICULTY THERE WAS 
SELF INFLICTED BUT OVERCOME 
HE IS OUT OF POSITION AGAIN HE 
PLAYED THEN FOR PINK INTO RIGHT 
CENTRE OR RIGHT CORNER BUT IS ON 
NEITHER HE IS FEELING IT OUT THERE 
I DO NOT CARE HOW STRONG YOUR 
TEMPERAMENT IS AND HOW HARD YOU 
TRY IT IS THAT BOYS AT THE BACK OF 
THIS IS THE 
CLINCHING FRAME 
HE IS CLOSING IN ON A QUARTER FINAL 
PLACE NOW 
HE HAS LOST THE CUE BALL A VERY 
SPRING DEEP BOUNCE 
IT CAME OFF THE CUSHION AT LEAST 
TWICE THE SPEED THAT IT WENT ON 
THAT WAS A GOOD A TENT AS GOOD AS 
HE COULD HAVE DONE FROM WHERE HE'S 
LANDED A GOOD ATTEMPT 
OUT OF POSITION BUT WITH A FIFTY TWO 
POINT LEAD AND BREAK CLOSE TO 
CLINCHING HIS POSITION IN THE LAST 
EIGHT VERY CLOSE 
AN EXCELLENT CUTBACK FROM AN ACUTE 
ANGLE 
FIFTY NINE IN FRONT WITH FIFTY NINE ON THE TABLE 
HE ATTEMPTED TO EAT A MATCH WINNING 
RED WITH THE ATTEMPTED TO 
DEVELOPING SHOT 
HE COULD HAVE MISSED THE PINK WITH 
THAT MUCH PACE AND BACK SPIN ON IT 
IT IS STILL SOME TASK FOR MARK KING 
TO PULL THIS FRAME OUT OF THE FIRE 
AND THOUGH 
IT IS ANY ONE SNOOKER IF HE TAKES 
THE PINK HERE 
A BIT UNLUCKY BECAUSE HE IS 
BRIDGING OVER THE BLACK FOR THE RED 
IT WAS ALL OVER 
PETER EBDON IS THE FIRST MAN INTO 
THE QUARTER FINAL THIS YEAR A GOOD 
EFFORT FROM MARK KING WHO STILL HAS 
A CHANCE OF BEING IN THE TOP SIXTEEN 
NEXT SEASON PETER EBDON WAS HAPPY 
ENOUGH WITH THAT PERFORMANCE I I CERTAINLY FELT VERY DETERMINED 
DECEIVING L. WOULD LIKE TO HAVE 
THOUGHT THAT WHAT MARK KING THREW 
AT ME I WOULD BE EQUAL TO THE 
CHALLENGE WHY PREPARATION HAS GONE 
WELL SOMETIMES YOU JUST UP TO GET 
BY IN MATCHES LIKE THAT IT IS NICE 
TO WIN AND NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY TOP 
FORM AT LEAST I HAVE GIVEN MYSELF 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY BETTER AND 
HOPEFULLY WIN A GAME IN THE NEXT 
BRAINED 
SNOOKER EXTRA IT IS NEXT BRAINED OTHERWISE WE WILL BE BACK ON B. B. C. 
ONE AT ONE P. M. SOMETHING TO DO JUST AS 
WE SAY FAREWELL DIGEST STEVE 
NEWBURY IS THE ONLY PLAYER WHOSE 
SURNAME BEGINS WITH A LETTER END 
TO HAVE PLAYED IN THE CRUCIBLE
