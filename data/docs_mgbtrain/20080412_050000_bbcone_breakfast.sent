GOOD MORNING ALSO ON TODAY'S 
PROGRAMME A PATIENCE IS WEARING 
THIN GORDON BROWN'S MESSAGE TO 
ROBERT MUGABE TO ONE OF DEMOCRACY 
IN ZIMBABWE 
TELL US HOW MUCH THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
IS REALLY COSTING YOU THE BANKS 
ARE GIVEN A ONE HUNDRED DAY DEADLINE TO 
ADMIT THE SIZE OF THEIR LOSSES 
OUR PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITES 
GIVING YOU THE BEST DEAL 
IAN POULTER LEADS THE EUROPEAN 
CHALLENGE AT THE MASTERS TIGER 
WOODS IS SEVEN SHOTS FROM THE LEAD 
AND WE LOOK AT THE LONDON MARATHON 
WILL MIKE BE ABLE TO TAKE IT IN HIS 
STRIDE STRIDE OUR MAIN STORY DRINKS IN PUBS ARE 
PUSHING CUSTOMERS INTO UNSAFE 
LEVELS OF DRINKING ONLY SIXTEEN PER CENT OF 
PUBS USED THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE M. M. WINE GLASS 
WHICH USED TO BE STANDARD MANY USE 
BIGGER CLASSES AND IN SOME A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY 
ML GLASS IS THE SMALLEST MEASURE 
IT IS SUPERSIZE DRINK MEASURES 
WHICH HAVE BROUGHT A BACKLASH FROM 
IN THE OVER BINGE DRINKING 
POLITICIANS SAY THE INCREASING 
TREND TO ONLY OFFER LARGER MEASURES 
IS CYNICAL PROFITEERING DOCTORS 
SAY IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE MANY MANY PEOPLE ARE DRINKING SIGNIFICANTLY 
MORE THAN THEY REALISE MANY PEOPLE 
ARE AWARE OF THE UNIX AND WANT TO 
SAY STAY WITHIN SIX MINUTES BUT 
ARE BEING PUSHED OVER THOSE LIMITS 
IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE AND WE HAVE TO 
PUT THIS HOUSE IN ORDER THIS THIS STANDARD SIZE OF THIS IS THE 
STANDARD SIZE CLASS BUT NOW ONLY 
SIXTEEN PER CENT OF LICENSED PREMISES SAY THIS 
IS THEIR NORMAL MEASURE THREE 
QUARTERS SAY THEY HAVE A LARGER 
MEASURE FOURTEEN PER CENT SAY THEY ONLY OFFER 
THIS BUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY M. M. SIZE A THIRD OF A 
BOTTLE OF WINE MANY BARS HAVE ALSO 
INCREASED SPIRIT MEASURES A 
LEADING INDUSTRY MAGAZINE RECENTLY 
ADVISED LANDLORDS TO TRAIN STAFF TO 
UP SELL PRODUCTS SOME M. P.'S WANT TO 
CALL TIME ON THIS 
IT IS 
PROFITEERING IT IS GETTING PEOPLE 
TO TRADE UP CALLING THE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE ML A 
STANDARD MEASURE WHEN IT IS 
ACTUALLY A LARGE PEOPLE SHOULD 
HAVE THE CHOICE IF THEY WANT A 
SMALL MEASURE OF WINE THE STANDARD 
SIZE THEY SHOULD GET IT 
IN THIS 
PART THEY ONLY SERVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY ML GLASSES 
OF WINE 
THE PROFIT MARGIN IS MORE 
SUBSTANTIAL THAN ON A ONE HAJ THAN 
TWENTY FIVE ML THERE IS PRESSURE L. HAVE TO 
MAKE MONEY FOR MY BOSS SO WE HAVE 
TO MAKE AS MUCH PROFIT ON EACH 
PRODUCT 
MOST WINE BARS DON'T GIVE PRODUCT YOU THE OPTION OF A SMALLER GLASS 
THEY IT AUTOMATICALLY GO TO A LARGE 
GLASS 
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GLASS PUSHING IT TOO MUCH 
THEY WILL GIVE 
YOU A LARGE GLASS OR A DOUBLE IF 
THEY CAN BECAUSE THEY ARE MAKING 
MORE MONEY WE NEED TO BE SMARTER 
AND SAY SMALL SHOPS 
THE DRINKS 
INDUSTRY SAYS CUSTOMERS SHOULD HAVE 
A CHOICE BUT CLAIM BIGGER MEASURES 
IS WHAT THEY WANT 
WE ARE IN THE 
BUSINESS OF CUSTOMER CHOICE LARGE 
MEASURES ARE HERE KING SIZE BEDS 
LARGE COFFEES BEER AND WINE SIZE 
IS INCREASING THE TRICK IS TO 
OFFER VALUE 
WHATEVER MEASURE YOU 
CHOOSE THE MESSAGE IS TO KNOW HOW 
MUCH YOU ARE DRINKING 
LATER IN THE PROGRAMME WE WILL BE 
TALKING TO THE ORGANISATION WHICH 
REPRESENTS LICENSEES TO ASK WHY 
SUCH LARGE MEASURES HAVE BEEN 
INTRODUCED PLEASE SEND US YOUR 
COMMENTS COMMENTS GORDON BROWN HAS WARNED ROBERT 
MUGABE THE WORLD IS RUNNING OUT OF 
PATIENCE WITH HIS REGIME HE SAID 
HE WAS APPALLED BY THE INTIMIDATION 
AND VIOLENCE AND COULD NOT 
UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS TAKING SO LONG 
TO ANNOUNCE THE RESULTS OF THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
IN ZIMBABWE'S CAPITAL POLICE HAVE 
BANNED POLITICAL RALLIES AMID 
GROWING TENSIONS OVER THE 
PRESIDENTIAL VOTE THE RESULTS HAVE 
STILL NOT BEEN RELEASED IN HIS 
STRONGEST COMMENTS YET GORDON 
BROWN ISSUED A STATEMENT VOICING 
HIS FRUSTRATION AT THE DELAY 
THERE HAD BEEN HOPES A MEETING OF 
REGIONAL LEADERS IN ZAMBIA TODAY 
COULD BREAK THE DEADLOCK ROBERT 
MUGABE HAS PROUDLY PULLED OUT OF 
THE MEETING SO THOSE HOPES AND NOW 
FADING FOR THE OPPOSITION 
PRESSURE FROM OUTSIDERS IS THE MAIN 
HOPE THEY STILL HAVE 
OUR HOPE IS 
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO USE THEIR 
POLITICAL INFLUENCE ON PRESIDENT 
MUGABE TO CONCEDE DEFEAT BECAUSE 
OF THAT ELECTION WAS WON BY US 
THEREFORE I THINK THE ONLY LOGICAL 
THING IS A PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF 
POWER 
THERE HAS BEEN NO RESPONSE POWER FROM PRESIDENT MUGABE TO GORDON 
BROWN'S RESPONSE IN THE PARTY HAS 
REACTED ANGRILY TO WHAT HE SEES AS 
INTERFERENCE FROM ZIMBABWE'S FORMER 
COLONIAL POWER 
THE WORLD'S SEVEN RICHEST COUNTRIES 
HAD GIVEN BIRTH ONE HUNDRED DAYS TO REVEAL 
HOW MUCH MONEY THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
HAS COST THEM A MEETING OF THE G. SEVEN 
FINANCE MINISTERS IN WASHINGTON 
ALSO CALLED FOR THE BANKS TO MAKE 
PUBLIC HOW MUCH MORE THEY COULD 
LOSE AND TO PROVE THEIR RISK 
PROCEDURES PROCEDURES THE BUCK STOPS WITH THEM FINANCE 
MINISTERS AND CENTRAL BANKERS FROM 
THE WORLD'S TOP SEVEN ECONOMIES 
THEY CAME TO WASHINGTON TO FIND A 
WAY TO STOP ANOTHER CREDIT CRUNCH 
BANK BOARD ROOMS HAVE BEEN BUFFETED 
FOR MONTHS BY TURBULENCE IN THE 
WORLD'S FINANCIAL MARKETS THE 
MINISTERS GAVE THEM ONE HUNDRED DAYS TO 
REVEAL HOW MUCH THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
HAS COST THEM THEY ARE ASKING 
BANKS TO BE MORE OPEN ABOUT WHERE 
THEIR MONEY IS INVESTED THE 
CHANCELLOR SAYS MAKING BANKS MORE 
TRANSPARENT IS THE WAY TO CALM 
TROUBLED WATERS 
IF ACTION CAN BE 
TAKEN AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL TO 
IMPROVE SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
WE SHOULD DO THAT WE ALSO WANT TO 
ENCOURAGE BANKS TO DISCLOSE THE 
LOSSES THEY MAY HAVE SUSTAINED SO 
CAN RESTORE CONFIDENCE IT IS 
IT IS CONFIDENCE WHICH MANY ECONOMISTS 
BELIEVE IS THE SILVER BULLET WHICH 
COULD STOP A RECESSION IN ITS 
TRACKS IT IS SADLY LACKING AT THE 
MOMENT YESTERDAY STOCK MARKETS 
DROPPED IN EUROPE AND THE U. S. 
BRITISH MORTGAGE LENDERS HAVE 
WARNED IT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THEY MAY AND THE 
LEND HALF WHAT THEY DID LAST YEAR 
IT IS THESE NERVES WHICH CAN SEND 
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE INTO FREEFALL 
IN AMERICA IT IS AT ITS LOWEST 
LEVEL THE TWENTY SIX YEARS THE G. SEVEN PLAN IS 
SUPPOSED TO PROTECT US FROM A 
FUTURE CREDIT CRUNCH BUT DAMAGE 
FROM THE CURRENT ONE IS STILL BEING 
FELT ECONOMISTS SAY AMERICA IS 
ALREADY IN RECESSION THE BRITISH 
HIGH STREET COULD BE NEXT 
CAR OWNERS COULD BE FINED IF THEY 
OR THEIR PASSENGERS ARE CAUGHT ON 
C. C. T. V. DROPPING LITTER LOCAL 
COUNCILS ON THE POWER TO CHASE 
MOTORISTS WHO FLY TIP ILLEGALLY 
DUMP COMMERCIAL WASTE OR THROW 
RUBBISH OUT OF THEIR WINDOWS 
THE T. E. C. IS URGING THE GOVERNMENT TO 
INTRODUCE MEASURES TO HELP MILLIONS 
OF LOW PAID WORKERS AFFECTED BY THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE 
BRENDAN BARBER HAS WARNED THE 
IMPACT OF THE NEW SYSTEM COMBINED 
WITH GENEROUS TAX BREAKS ENJOYED BY 
THE SUPER RICH IS CAUSING HUGE 
RESENTMENT AMONGST ORDINARY WORKERS 
THE BIGGEST AIRLINE IN THE U. S. 
AMERICAN AIRLINES SAYS IT HOPES TO 
GET BACK TO NORMAL THIS WEEKEND 
AFTER CANCELLING THREE THOUSAND FLIGHTS FOR 
SAFETY CHECKS IT SAID THREE 
QUARTERS OF ITS M. D. EIGHTY AIRCRAFT HAD 
BEEN INSPECTED FOR POSSIBLE WIRING 
FAULTS AND THE REIGNING SHOULD 
RETURN TO SERVICE BY SUNDAY 
REMAINING THE UN ESTIMATES TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN DARFUR 
SINCE FIGHTING FIVE YEARS AGO THIS 
WEEKEND A NEW CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN 
LODGED TO HIGHLIGHT THE PROBLEMS 
BEING CAUSED BY THE CONFLICT THERE 
IS A CALL FOR MORE HELP FOR THE 
CHILDREN LEFT THAT PARENTS OR HOMES 
TWO WORLD THAT COULD NOT BE FURTHER 
APART THIS WEEKEND CELEBRITIES 
CAME TOGETHER WITH AID AGENCIES TO 
CALL FOR ACTION IN DARFUR IN AN 
OPEN AUTHOR CHILDREN'S AUTHORS WON 
THE IN BUT WHAT THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE TO DEMAND A 
CEASEFIRE OTHER CELEBRITIES LIKE 
MATT DAMON AND JEMIMA KHAN ARE 
FRONTING A T. V. CAMPAIGN IN WHICH 
THEY SMASHED TOYS TO SYMBOLISE 
CHARLES HAD UNDER ATTACK CHILDREN 
IN BRITAIN MIGHT DRAW PICTURES OF 
THEIR OWN PARENTS BUT KIDS IN 
DARFUR HAD DRAWN THESE PICTURES OF 
VILLAGES ON FIRE PEOPLE BEING 
MUTILATED AND WOMEN BEING TIED UP 
THE UN ESTIMATES TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 
HAVE DIED ALREADY IN THE CONFLICT 
TWO MILLION ARE HOMELESS AND THE 
PEOPLE BEHIND THIS CAMPAIGN WANT 
THE WORLD TO DO SOMETHING 
THE UN 
JOINT PEACEKEEPING FORCE WITH THE 
AFRICAN UNION HAS TO BE DEPLOYED 
IT HAS TO BE GIVEN ENOUGH PETROL TO 
RUN VEHICLES ENOUGH WATER FOR 
SOLDIERS TO PROTECT THE CIVILIANS 
FIVE YEARS ON AND THOUGHT IS STILL 
RAGING CAMPAIGNERS HOPE TOMORROW'S 
EVENTS WILL DRAW ATTENTION TO THE 
CHILDREN OF THE REGION WHO HAVE 
NEVER KNOWN PEACE 
WE WILL BE JOINED BY JASON ISAACS 
WHO WOULD YOU KNOW FROM THE HARRY 
POTTER FILMS ARE MORE ON THAT 
CAMPAIGN CAMPAIGN LET US LOOK AT OUR TOP STORIES 
IT IS NOW TWO WEEKS SINCE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS WERE HELD IN 
ZIMBABWE BUT STILL THE RESULTS HAVE 
NOT BEEN ANNOUNCED GORDON BROWN 
HAS WARNED THE WORLD IS LOSING 
PATIENCE WILL IT MAKE ANY 
DIFFERENCE THE B. B. C. IS BANNED FROM 
ZIMBABWE SAY PETER GRESTE IS IN 
SOUTH AFRICA FOR US THIS MORNING 
LOOKING THROUGH THE WORDS OF GORDON 
BROWN IT IS HIS STARKEST WARNING 
YET WHAT IMPACT WOULD IT HAVE I I AM AFRAID I DID IT ALL HAVE THE 
SLIGHTEST IMPACT IT MAY END UP 
BEING COUNTER PRODUCTIVE THE ONE 
THING ROBERT MUGABE DAY HAS ALWAYS 
SAID THE THEME OF HIS CAMPAIGN 
HAS BEEN BRITAIN IS THE ENEMY THEY 
ARE TRYING TO PROTECT ZIMBABWE FROM 
COLONIAL INTERFERENCE GORDON 
BROWN'S COMMENTS IF ANYTHING WILL 
ONLY HARDEN HIS RESOLVE TO STAY PUT 
I DO NOT SEE IT WILL MAKE ANY 
DIFFERENCE 
LOOKING THROUGH THOSE DIFFERENCE WORDS OF GORDON BROWN HE SAYS THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEES PATIENCE 
IS WEARING THIN WITH THE REGIME 
JUDGING FROM WHAT YOU SAID IT 
MATTERS NOT WHAT HE IS SAYING 
SOUTHERN AFRICA IS IN MEETING 
TODAY IT AND THEY WILL HAVE AN 
INFLUX THE SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT 
WILL HAVE MORE INFLUENCE THAN 
ANYONE ROBERT MUGABE HIMSELF IS 
SEEN AS THE OTHER STATEMENTS 
STATESMEN IN THIS REGION HE IS 
SEEN AS THE LIBERATOR OF ZIMBABWE 
BUT MORE EXPENSE HEAT IS SENIOR TO 
EVERYONE AT THAT TABLE IN ALL SORTS 
OF RESPECTS AND NOT INCLINED TO 
TAKE ORDERS FROM THEM ROBERT 
MUGABE WAVERED IN THE IMMEDIATE 
WEEK FOLLOWING THE ELECTIONS IT 
LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE SHOCKED BY 
THAT RESULT SINCE THEN THEY HAVE 
HARDENED THEIR POSITION THEY HAD 
DUG THEIR HEELS IN IT LOOKS AS IF 
THEY ARE PREPARING TO STAY FOR THE 
LONG HAUL IT IS HARD SEE WHAT THE 
SOUTH AFRICAN LEADERS CAN DO AT 
THIS STAGE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN 
ZIMBABWE 
IF AND IT IS A BIG IF ZIMBABWE THERE IS A RESULT GIVEN ON THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAN ANYONE 
BELIEVE THAT RESULT ANYWAY 
LET US 
GET BACK TO WHAT MUGABE HAS BEEN 
INSISTING THAT THE ONLY THING 
HOLDING THIS UP IS A VERY CAREFUL 
AND SCRUPULOUS ACCOUNT OF THE 
ELECTIONS AND THEY WILL RELEASE 
THEM THE POSITION IS INSISTING IN 
FACT THE WHOLE THING IS A FRAUD 
THEY HAVE POINTED OUT THE 
DISTURBING FACT THAT THE 
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ELECTORAL 
COMMISSION HAVE BEEN BOARDED UP AND 
THE ELECTRONIC INDEPENDENT 
OBSERVERS HAVE BEEN SHUT OUT OF THE 
RECANT PROCESS THE BALLOT PAPERS 
HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY THE WHOLE 
THING IS BEING CONDUCTED IN PRIVATE 
WHAT EVER THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION 
SAYS ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF THE 
NUMBERS THE REST OF THE WORLD WILL 
SAY THERE IS NO WAY WE CAN TRUST 
THOSE NUMBERS 
LET'S HAVE A QUICK LOOK THROUGH THE 
FRONT PAGES THIS MORNING

THOUSAND TIMES A MONTH LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES ARE USING SOME OF THOSE 
SURVEILLANCE TECHNIQUES

HI GOOD MORNING THE WEATHER'S 
TYPICAL APRIL OVER THE PAST COUPLE 
OF DAYS A MIXTURE OF SUNNY SPELLS

AGAIN TODAY ONCE AGAIN SOME OF 
THE SHOWERS COULD BE HEAVY AND 
THUNDERY WITH HAIL MIXED IN AT 
TIMES NINE HUNDRED ACROSS DEVON AND 
CORNWALL SHOWERS INTERSPERSED BY 
BRIGHTER SPELLS WALES MAINLY DRY 
BUT THE SHOWERS WILL BECOME A 
LITTLE BIT WIDESPREAD TOWARDS THE 
MIDDLE PART OF THE DAY NORTHERN 
IRELAND CHILLY START DRY ACROSS 
THE NORTHERN HALF OF SCOTLAND BUT 
SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY YOU HAVE A 
MIXTURE OF RAIN SLEET OR SNOW 
POSSIBLY TEMPORARY COVERING BUT 
SHOULDN'T LAST TOO LONG WE HAVE 
RISE IN SNOW ACROSS NORNING ENGLAND 
GRADUALLY MELTING AWAY IN THE APRIL 
SUNSHINE AS THE SUN GETS TO WORK 
SOUTH OF THAT THE DECENT START TO 
THE DAY DRY AND BRIGHT WITH 
SUNSHINE AND WINDS LIGHT AS WELL 
THE RAIN SLEET AND SNOW ACROSS 
SOUTHERN SCOTLAND WILL SLIDE 
SOUTHWARDS INTO NORTHERN ENGLAND 
SHOWERS DEVELOPING AS THE DAY GOES 
ON HEAVIEST ACROSS SOUTHERN 
COUNTIES OF ENGLAND AND NORTHERN 
IRELAND WHERE THERE COULD BE HAIL 
AND THUNDER MIXED IN COOL DAY 
ACROSS THE EAST OF SCOTLAND WITH AN 
ON SHORE BREEZE OVERNIGHT TONIGHT 
THE SHOWERS WILL TEND TO DIE AWAY 
ACROSS THE U. K. BUT ANOTHER CLUSTER 
OF SHOWERS LEAVING NORTHERN IRELAND 
PUSHING INTO WALES AND SOUTH 
WESTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND BY DAWN 
ELSEWHERE IT SHOULD STAY DRY 
CHILLY NIGHT THOUGH LOW ENOUGH FOR 
A TOUCH OF GROUND FROST EVEN THE 
ODD ICY PATCH WITH MOISTURE 
TOMORROW MORNING A CLUSTER OF 
SHOWERS ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF OF 
THE U. K. SHOWERS WILL DEVELOP AS THE 
MORNING GOES ON AND ACROSS ENGLAND 
AND WALES THERE COULD BE HAIL AND 
THUNDER MIXED IN TOO TEMPERATURES 
SIMILAR VALUES IN THE RANGE OF EIGHT TO FOURTEEN 
DEGREES LONDON MARATHON TOMORROW 
THE SHOWERS WILL BECOME MORE 
FREQUENT BY THE MIDDLE OF THE 
AFTERNOON AND COULD BE HEAVY WITH 
THE ODD RUMBLE OF THUNDER MONDAY 
NOT TOO BAD A DAY SPELLS OF 
SUNSHINE A FEW SCATTERED SHOWERS 
PERSISTENT RAIN IN THE WESTERN 
PARTS OF SCOTLAND IT IS LOOKING 
SHOWERY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
DAYS THANK YOU NOW HIGH ENERGY 
BILLS AND RISING MORTGAGES ARE 
PROMPTING THOUSANDS OF US TO SHOP 
AROUND FOR BETTER DEALS RAISE FOR 
MANY THE QUICKEST AND EASIEST WAY 
ASK TO USE PRICE COMPARISON 
WEBSITE BUT DO THEY OFFER THE BEST 
PRICES EXPERTS SAY THE ADVICE THEY 
CAN GIVE IS SKEWED BY FINANCIAL 
INCENTIVES THERE ARE CALLS FOR AN 
INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY TO OVERSEE OR 
TAKE OVER RUNNING THEM 
THE MESSAGE 
FROM THE COMPARISON SITES IS SIMPLE 
THEY ARE SHOP AROUND FOR THE BEST 
DEAL SO WE DON'T HAVE TO THAT 
SAVES US TIME AND MORE IMPORTANTLY 
MONEY OFF OUR BILLS BUT THEY CAN 
ALSO MAKE MILLIONS FOR THE 
COMPANIES THAT RUN THEM ALTHOUGH 
THEY WON'T TELL US HOW MUCH ROOM OF 
THEM CHARGE BANKS AND UTILITIES 
EITHER EVERY TIME WE SWITCH OR 
EVERY TIME WE CLICK TO THEIR SITES 
NOW THERE ARE CALLS FOR BETTER 
REGULATION 
THERE ARE INCENTIVES REGULATION THERE WHICH WILL TEND TO SKEW THE 
INFORMATION THEY GIVE TO CONSUMERS 
AND FOR CONSUMERS TO BE KF KENT 
THEY'RE GETTING ADVICE THAT'S RIGHT 
FOR THEM RATHER THAN THE ADVICE 
THAT'S RIGHT FOR THE COMPARISON 
WEBSITE IT IS GOOD TO HAVE AN 
INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY WHO CAN MAKE 
SURE THE INFORMATION IS IMPARTIAL 
OR PERHAPS RUN THE WEBSITE 
THEMSELVES 
SO DO THESE SITES THEMSELVES ALWAYS OFFER THE BEST DEAL ADRIAN 
DOESN'T THINK SO HE'S LOOKING TO 
SWITCH HIS GAS AND ELECTRICITY 
SUPPLIER 
IF I LOOKED AT TWO OR SUPPLIER THREE COST COMPARISON WEBSITES THE 
SAME DETAILS I ENTER IN ONE WERE 
NOT GIVING ME THE SAME RESULT AS TO 
WHAT THE BEST DEAL WAS ON NORWEB 
SIGHT THIS RAISED ALARM PELS AS TO 
WHAT INFORMATION BSH BELLS AS TO 
WHAT INFORMATION IT IS BASED ON 
ACCREDITATION CODE WAS INTRODUCE 
SOD COMPARISON SIGHTS WOULD INCLUDE 
ALL GAS AND ELECTRICITY COMPANIES 
EVEN THOSE WHO DIDN'T PAY WHEN 
CONSUMERS SWITCHED IT SEEMS SO 
MUCH THE NEWEST ENERGY SUPPLIERS 
AREN'T ALWAYS LISTED AND THE CODE 
DOESN'T COVER THINGS LIKE CREDIT 
CARDS INSURANCE AND SAVINGS 
ACCOUNTS RESEARCH CARRIED OUT BY 
FINANCIAL MAGAZINE REVEALED 
INTERESTING RESULTS IT SHOPPED 
AROUND FOR HOME INSURANCE CREDIT 
CARD SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND TRAVEL 
INSURANCE USING SEVERAL DIFFERENT 
COMPARISON SITES IN EVERY CASE 
EACH SITE CAME ONE DIFFERENT DEAL 
THAT IT SAID WAS THE BEST THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY MUCH BRANDED THE CONSUMER 
CHAMPION AND THEY'LL GET THE BEST 
DEAL THEY ARE COMMERCIAL 
ENTERPRISES AND THESE WEBSITES WILL 
HAVE COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH 
THE PROVIDERS AND THEY'RE IN THE 
BUSINESS OF MAKING MONEY WE'D LIKE 
THE WEBSITES TO BE MORE UPFRONT OF 
HOW MUCH THEY EARN FROM THE 
PROVIDERS 
THE COMPARISON SITES PROVIDERS REJECT THE ACCUSATIONS OF BIAS NEW 
SWITCH IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST IT 
SAYS WITHOUT SITES LIKE ITS OWN 
CONSUMERS WOULD BE WORSE OFF 
I CAN 
ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE IF SOMEBODY 
COMES ON OUR SITE AND PUTS 
INFORMATION IN THEY WILL SAVE 
MONEY IN FACT THE SAVINGS CAN BE 
SIGNIFICANT 
THE FINANCIAL SIGNIFICANT REGULATOR THE F. S. A. IS LOOKING AT 
THE WAY COMPARISON SITES RECOMMEND 
BEST INSURANCE BUYS BUT THERE'S NO 
SIGN OF WIDESPREAD REGULATION JUST 
YET IN THE MEANTIME THE ADVICE IS 
TO SHOP AROUND SEVERAL DIFFERENT 
COMPARISON SITES AND REALISE THE 
BEST DEAL MAY NOT BE AS GOOD AS IT

WELL ON BREAKFAST A LOOK AT THE 
CHANGING FACE OF FILM TECHNOLOGY AT 
CHANGING FACE OF FILM TECHNOLOGY AT CLICK 
HI I'M MIKE CLICK'S CAMERAMAN MY 
CAMERA COST FIFTY TWO THOUSAND L. FILMED ALL 
THE GREATS JAMES BOND ITALIAN JOB 
BATTLE OF BRITAIN AND NOW THEY'VE 
TOLD ME THAT THEY DON'T NEED ME ANY 
MORE 
WELCOME TO CLICK I'M SPENCER KELLY 
THIS WEEK IT IS CAMCORDERS THE 
LITTLE BOXES OF MAGIC WHICH RECORD 
YOUR HOLIDAYS IN PARADISE BABY'S 
FIRST STEPS AND ANIMALS DOING THE 
FUNNIEST THINGS VIDEO TECHNOLOGY 
HAS COME ON AMAZINGLY IN THE LAST 
FEW YEARS HIGH END MEGABUDGET 
PRODUCTIONS LIKE US ARE ABLE TO 
USE RELATIVELY SMALL AND CHEAP 
CAMERAS THIS ONE ONLY COST US A 
FEW THOUSANDS POUNDS UNDER THE 
RIGHT CONDITIONS IT CAN STILL 
PRODUCE DECENT T. V. QUALITY PICTURES 
WHEN WE'RE RECORDING THE REALLY 
IMPORTANT STUFF WE USE THE BIG 
FELLA THAT'S THE CAMERA NOT MIKE 
SO WHICH TO BUY WELL THE FIRST 
THING YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT IS 
WHETHER YOU WANT TO CAPTURE YOUR 
MEMORIES OF PARADISE N. ULTRA CLEAR 
HI DEF IN ADDITION OR IN PLAIN OLD 
STANDARD IF YOU NEVER PLAN TO 
WATCH THE VIDEOS ON A HI DEF T. V. 
YOU WON'T NEED A HI DEF CAMCORDER 
MOST WILL CONNECT TO A HI DEF OR 
STANDARD DEFTV ONE BIG DECISION 
YOU NEED TO MAKE IS WHAT DO YOU 
WANT TO RECORD ON TO WHICH 
RECORDING FORMAT SHOULD YOU USE 
THERE R. HERE THERE ARE FOUR CHOICES 
EACH HAS THEIR OWN PROS AND CONS 
D. V. TAPE IS VERY ROBUST AND RECORDS 
THE HIGHEST QUALITY PICTURES N. FACT 
WE STILL USE A LOT OF IT ON CLICK 
D. V. CAM KORDERS ARE CHEAPER 
ALTHOUGH CARRYING TAPES CAN BE A 
HASSLE D. V. D. CAMCORDERS USE DISCS 
THAT CAN BE POPPED IN YOUR PLAYER 
THE CAMERAS ARE SLOW TO START UP 
AND DISCS CAN SCRATCH HARD DRIVE 
ARE REASONABLY COMMON MORE 
EXPENSIVE FEATURE FOR FEATURE BUT 
LACK OF A TAPE OR LOADING BAY 
MEANS THEY'RE BETTER TO FIT TO THE 
GRIP THERE ARE THESE THE LATEST 
CAMCORDERS THANK WHICH WILL RECORD 
TO A PIECE OF FLASH MEMORY LIKE 
THIS S. D. CARD L. WAS SCEPTICAL WHEN 
I HEARD ABOUT THESE AFTER ALL YOU 
ARE TRYING TO SQUASH YOUR VIDEO 
DOWN TO SOMETHING THAT BIG MOBILE 
PHONES AND EXACT DIDGE IT WILL 
STILLS CAMERAS HAVE OFFERED THIS 
FACILITY FOR A WHILE BUT IT IS 
HIGHLY COME PRESSED TO FIT ON THE 
CARDS CHECK OUT THE JERKYNESS OF 
THIS VIDEO AND BLOCKYNESS IN THE 
TREES IMAGINE OUR SURPRISE WHEN 
CONSUMER MAGAZINE STARTED TO GIVE 
FLASH CAMCORDERS HIGH MARKS IN 
THEIR TESTS 
IT'S THANKS TO NEW VIDEO COME PREGS 
TECHNIQUES LIKE AVCHD AND MPEG TWO 
T. R. THAT INCLUDES NORMAL D. V. D. S. 
WITHOUT LOSING TECHNOLOGY THE NEXT 
THING THAT WILL CATCH YOUR EYE IS 
THE SIZE OF THE ZOOM SO HOW MUCH 
ZOOM DO YOU REALLY NEED WELL TO 
GIVE YOU AN IDEA WE'RE FILMING 
THIS ON TEN TIMES ZOOM WHICH IS 
SHOULD BE ENOUGH IN FACT TEN OR TWELVE 
TIMES ZOOM IS COMMON PLACE 
ALTHOUGH SOME CAMCORDERS ARE 
PUSHING THAT AS HIGH AS FIFTY AS WELL 
AS THE OPTICAL ZOOM FIGURE MANY 
MANUFACTURERS WILL QUOTE INCREDIBLE 
FIGURES FOR THEIR DIGITAL ZOOM BUT 
JUST AS WITH STILLS CAMERAS A 
DIGITAL ZOOM CAN MAKE THE PIXELS OF 
THE PICTURE BIGGER SO YOU CAN ZOOM 
IN HUNDREDS OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF 
TIMES BUT YOU PROBABLY WON'T TELL 
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THERE ARE 
LOADS OF FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN 
CHOOSING THE RIGHT CAMCORDER IF 
YOU'RE PREPARED TO PAY A BIT MORE 
YOU DO GENERALLY GET BETTER 
FUNCTIONALITY FOR BETTER COLOURS 
GO FOR THREE C. C. D.'S INSTEAD OF ONE 
IF YOU WANT A QUICK SHEETER GO FOR 
A HARD DRIVE OR FLASH CAMCORDER SO 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FUMBLE FOR A TAPE 
OR DISC THE MORE BUTTONS YOU HAVE 
THE EASIER ACCESS YOU HAVE TO 
IMPORTANT CONTROLS INSTEAD OF 
WADING THROUGH SUBMEPUES ON YOUR 
TOUCH SCREEN BELIEVE ME THAT CAN 
MAKE FILMING YOUR MASTERPIECE A 
MUCH MORE PLEASANT EXPERIENCE O. K. 
THAT'S ALL THE JARGON ON THE BOX 
EXPLAINED OF COURSE ALL THE 
FEATURES IN THE WORLD WON'T MAKE 
YOU STEVEN SPIELBERG FOR THAT YOU 
NEED OUR HOT VIDEO TIPS THEY'RE 
COMING UP IN A MOMENT FIRST NEWS

THE SERVICE THE NEWS COMES AS 
INTERNET PROVIDERS COMPLAIN THE 
IPLAYER HAS BECOME SO POPULAR 
THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO COPE WITH 
DEMAND FOR BAND WIDTH THE B. B. C. 
REJECTED CALLS IT SHOULD PAY FOR 
UPGRADING THE NETWORK FOUR YEARS

FINALLY THE DOWN TO EARTH VERSION 
OF GOOGLE EARTH STRAIGHT VIEW 
WHICH SHOWS AN EYE LEVEL VIEW 
THROUGH PHOTOS IS IN A SPOT OF HOT 
WATER AMERICAN COUPLE IN 
PENNSYLVANIA WEREN'T HAPPY WHEN 
FAIR HOME IN A PRIVATE ROAD TURNED 
UP MR. AND MRS. BORING NO I'M NOT 
MAKING IT UP ARE SUING GOOGLE FOR 
DAMAGES OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS SIGHTING 
INVASION OF PRIVACY AND MENTAL 
SUFFERING GOOGLE SAYS IT PROVIDERS 
TOOLS INCLUDING THIS VIDEO FOR 
ANYONE WHO WANTS IMAGES REMOVED 
AND IT'S TAKEN THE OFFENDING PHOTO 
DOWN THE TROUBLE IS BECAUSE OF 
THE STORY THE PICTURE OF THE 
BORINGS ABODE HAS TURNED UP ALL 
OVER THE WEB NOW IT MAY SOUND 
OBVIOUS BUT GETTING DOWN AND DIRTY 
WITH THE CAMCORDER'S OPERATING 
MANUAL GETS BETTER RESULT EVEN IF 
YOU KNOW HOW TO TURN IT ON YOU 
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH 
THEM THIS IS WHY RICHARD HAS 
BECOME A SHARP SHOOTER THESE DAYS 
WE'RE ALL AT IT REMEMBER THAT BY 
SHOOTING SOMETHING ANYTHING BUT 
YOUR KIDS A WEDDING OR PARTY YOU'RE 
TELLING A STORE YIFPLT AND WITH ANY 
STORY YOU CAN TELL IT WELL OR YOU 
CAN TELL IT NOT SO WELL WHAT WE'RE 
GOING TO DO TO DEMONSTRATE BETWEEN 
AMATEUR AND PROFESSIONAL CAMERA 
WORK IS TO PERFORM A STREET WALKER 
HE IS NOT A MILLION MILES OFF 
MEETING THAT LABEL OF PROFESSIONAL 
I AM A AMATEUR 
LET'S GO 
RIGHT I'M IN POSITION AND HERE IS 
MY CRACK OF BEING A FIRST CLASS 
ROOKIE I'M KEEPING THE CAMERA AT 
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME HEIGHT 
THROUGHOUT NOTICE THE ARTFUL TRAM 
BONING IN AND OUT OF THE SCENE 
MARVEL AT THE WOBBLE FOR A BIT OF 
ADDED ZING I'M PANNING LIKE A DOG 
LOOKING FOR A VICTIM I'M DOING IT 
IN ONE LONG TAKE HANG ON THAT'S 
MIKE HE'S BEHIND THE PERFORMER 
YES MIKE'S DOING A TOP JOB AT 
ACTING THE PRO IT IS HARD TO 
BELIEVE THIS IS THE SAME SCENE 
ADMIRE THE VARIETY OF HIS SHOTS 
USING DIFFERENT ANGLES MAKES THE 
PRODUCT WAY MORE INTERESTING HE'S 
PUTTING THE PAUSE BUTTON TO GOOD 
USE EDITING AS HE'S GOING ALWAYS ALWAYS KEEP ON THE MOVE 
HE'S HOLDING EACH 
SHOT FOR A GOOD FEW SECONDS AND 
LETTING THE ACTION TAKE PLACE 
INSIDE THE FRAME NOTICE HOW HE IS 
USING HIS OWN FRAME AS A KIND OF 
TRIPOD KEEPING THE CAMERA TUCKED IN 
CLOSE TO HIS BODY WHERE POSSIBLE 
HE IS LEANING ON ANY OBJECT AND 
JUST TO MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE HIS 
SHOTS ARE STEADY HE IS FAVOURING 
THE WIDE END OF THE ZOOM LENS 
WHICH MASKS ANY CAMERA SHAKE SO 
PERFORMANCE OVER HERE IS A FEW 
TIPS WORTH SHARING THINK CAREFULLY 
ABOUT THE COMPOSITION OF YOUR SHOT 
DON'T PUT SUGGESTS DEAD CENTRE ON 
FRAME AND ADDING FOREGROUND 
INTERESTS GIVE VIEWERS PROSPECTIVE 
ON THE SCENE GOOD LIGHT IS YOUR 
FRIEND OVERCAST DAYS ARE GOOD FOR 
FLATTERING LOW CONTRAST SHOTS A 
WORLD AWAY FROM HARSH SHADOWS 
PRODUCED BY THE SUN F. YOU ARE GOING 
TO SHOOT IN THE SUN MAKE IT 
TOWARDS THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY 
WHERE THE SOFT LIGHT CAN BRING OUT 
GREAT RESULTS BEWARE THE AUTOMATIC 
SETTING F. THERE'S TOO MUCH LIGHT 
AROUND THE SUBJECT YOUR CAMERA 
WILL GET CONFUSED EITHER ZOOM IN 
AND LOCK THE EXPOSURE OR CHOOSE A 
BACKGROUND WITH SIMILAR LIGHTS 
AUTOMATIC FOCUS GET CONFUSED DON'T 
USE IT IF YOU HAVE A DENSE OR 
PATTERNED BACKGROUND TELL SHRI NOT 
JUST ABOUT THE VISION BUT SOUND IS 
HORRIBLY NEGLECTED EVEN POOR SOUND 
WILL SHOW UP JUST HOW MUCH OF AN 
AMATEUR YOU ARE 
THE MIC IS 
SENSITIVE SO FOR USABLE SOUND GET 
THE CAMERA IN CLOSER 
FINALLY FOR 
GOODNESS SAKE DON'T PUT CHEESEY 
FADES AND EFFECT IN YOU WILL HAVE 
COMMITTED YOURSELF IF YOU DO AND 
THEY CAN BE ADDED IN A SNAP 
AFTERWARDS THAT'S WHERE YOUR 
MASTERPIECE WILL TAKE SHAPE 
ASSUMING YOU FOLLOW THIS GUIDE 
THAT'S IT I HOPE YOU FOUND OUR 
TIPS ON CAMCORDERS AND FILMING 
TECHNIQUES HELPFUL ASK US

WE WILL SEE YOU NEXT TIME THANKS 
FOR WATCHING 
GOOD MORNING WELCOME TO BREAKFAST 
PUBS ARE IN THE FIRING LINE FOR 
SUPERSIZING OUR DRINKS DOCTORS SAY 
WE ARE BEING PUSHED INTO DRINKING 
TOO MUCH 
GOOD MORNING ALSO ON TODAY'S 
PROGRAMME OUTPATIENTS IS WEARING 
THIN GORDON BROWN'S MISSION WHICH 
TOOK ROBERT MUGABE ON A 
DEMOCRACY TELL US HOW MUCH THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH HAS COST YOU THE 
BANKS ARE GIVEN A ONE HUNDRED DAY DEADLINE 
TO ADMIT THE SIZE OF LOSSES PLANS 
TO USE C. C. T. V. TO FIND PEOPLE WHO 
THROW LITTER OUT OF THEIR CAR 
WINDOWS WE SPEAK TO THE MAN WHO IS 
POINTING THE CAMERAS AT THE DRIVERS 
A PRICE COMPARISON ARE AT THE 
PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITE GIVES YOU 
THE BEST DEAL AND WE LOOK AT THE 
LONG AND SHORT OF THE MARATHON 
WILL MIKE BE ABLE TO TAKE IT IN HIS 
STRIDE STRIDE SUPERSIZED DRINKS IN PUBS ARE 
PUSHING CUSTOMERS INTO UNSAFE 
LEVELS OF DRINKING ACCORDING TO THE 
ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS WHICH 
IS ACCUSING THE INDUSTRY OF 
IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOUR THE ONE TWENTY FIVE M. L. 
CLASS WHICH USED TO BE THE STANDARD 
IS NOW USED IN ONLY ONE IN SIX 
PARTS 
A SUPERSIZED BAR IN A SUPERSIZED 
WORLD BUT IT IS SUPERSIZED GREAT 
MEASURES WHICH HAVE BROUGHT A 
BACKLASH FROM POLITICIANS IN THE 
BATTLE AGAINST BINGE DRINKING PUB 
OWNERS ARE STRUGGLING AGAINST THE 
ECONOMIC SQUEEZE POLITICIANS ARE 
SAYING THE INCREASING TREND TO 
OFFER ONLY LARGE MEASURES IS 
CYNICAL PROFITEERING DOCTORS SAY 
IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE 
THERE IS NO 
DOUBT MANY PEOPLE ARE DRINKING 
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THEY 
REALISE MANY PEOPLE ARE AWARE THAT 
THEY HAVE TO STAY WITHIN SAFE 
LIMITS BUT THEY ARE BEING PUSHED 
OVER SAFE LIMITS BY NOT REALISING 
WHAT THEY ARE DRINKING IT IS 
IRRESPONSIBLE AND THE INDUSTRY HAS 
PUT HIS HOUSE IN ORDER 
THIS ONE TWENTY FIVE M. L. 
CLASSES TO BE THE STANDARD SIZE 
NAD JUST SIXTEEN PER CENT OF LICENSED PREMISES 
SAY THIS IS THEIR NORMAL SIZED 
MEASURE NEARLY THREE QUARTERS SAY 
THIS LARGER CLASS IS A SMALL AND 
THIS TWO FIFTY M. L. IS A LARGE FOURTEEN PER CENT OF 
PREMISES SAY THEY ONLY OFFER THIS 
TWO FIFTY M. L. SIZE ONE THIRD OF A BOTTLE 
OF WINE MANY BARS HAVE ALSO 
INCREASED SPIRIT MEASURES FROM TWENTY FIVE 
TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLILITRES A LEADING INDUSTRY 
MAXINE RECENTLY ADVISED THE 
LANDLORD TO TRAIN AND INCENTIVE 
THAT STAFF TO ART SELL PRODUCTS 
SUCH AS LARGER MEASURES SOME M. P.'S 
WANT TO SELL CALL TIME ON THIS 
IT IS PROFITEERING CALLING THE 
ONE TWENTY FIVE M. L. A SMALL MEASURE WHEN IT WAS 
A STANDARD PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE 
CHOICE IF THEY WANT A SMALL 
MEASURE OF WINE WHICH HAS ALWAYS 
BEEN A STANDARD SIZE THEY SHOULD 
GET IT 
IN THIS PUB THEY ONLY SERVE 
TWO FIFTY M. L. MEASURES 
THE PROFIT MARGIN 
ON TWO FIFTY M. L. IS MORE SUBSTANTIAL THAN 
ON A MEDIA MACRO 
IS THERE 
PRESSURE 
ABSOLUTELY L. HAVE TO PRESSURE MAKE MONEY FOR THE OWNER WE HAVE 
TO MAKE AS MUCH PROFIT ON EACH 
PRODUCT 
MOST WINE BARS DO NOT GIVE PRODUCT YOU THE OPTION OF HIS SMALL OR 
WYATT OR LARGE GLASS 
I DON'T 
THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO PUSH IT TOO 
MUCH 
THERE WILL GIVE YOU A LARGE MUCH MEASURE IF THEY CAN BECAUSE THEY 
ARE MAKING MORE MONEY ON IT WE 
NEED TO BE SMARTER AND SAY SMALL 
SHOPS 
THE DRINKS INDUSTRY SAYS SHOPS CUSTOMERS SHOULD HAVE A CHOICE BUT 
BIGGER MEASURES IS WHAT THEY WANT 
WE ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF CUSTOMER 
CHOICE SUPERSIZING HAS BEEN OVER 
HERE FROM AMERICA FOR A LONG TIME 
KING SIZE BEDS BEARD WINE SIZE 
IS INCREASING THE TRICK IS TO 
OFFER VALUE 
WHATEVER MEASURE YOU 
CHOOSE THE MESSAGE IS TO KNOW HOW 
MUCH YOU ARE DRINKING 
WE'LL BE TALKING TO THE 
ORGANISATION WHICH REPRESENTS 
LICENSEES TO ASK WHY SUCH A LARGE 
MEASURES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED 
GORDON BROWN HAS WARNED ROBERT 
MUGABE THE WORLD IS RUNNING OUT OF 
PATIENCE WITH HIS REGIME MR. BROWN 
SAID HE WAS APPALLED BY 
INTIMIDATION AND VIOLENCE AND COULD 
NOT UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS TAKING SO 
LONG TO ANNOUNCE THE RESULTS OF 
LAST MONTH'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
THE B. B. C. IS BANNED FROM ZIMBABWE SO 
OUR CORRESPONDENT IS IN SOUTH 
AFRICA FIRST OF ALL DO YOU THINK 
GORDON BROWN'S COMMENTS ARE LIKELY 
TO HAVE ANY EFFECT 
I THINK THEY 
WON'T MAKE A JOT OF DIFFERENCE 
LET'S BE CORRECT MYSELF IT MAY BE 
COUNTER PRODUCTIVE IF ANYTHING THE 
MAIN THEME OF THE CAMPAIGN BY 
ROBERT MUGABE HAS BEEN THIS IS 
ABOUT PROTECTING ZIMBABWE AND ITS 
SOVEREIGNTY FROM COLONIAL 
INTERFERENCE THIS MORNING THE 
STATE RUN HELD RAN AN EXTENSIVE 
ARTICLE BLAMING SHORTAGES ON 
COLONIAL ATTEMPTS TO BRING DOWN THE 
GOVERNMENT BY STRANGLING ITS 
ECONOMY SO THESE REMARKS ONLY PLAY 
INTO THE HANDS OF THE ZANU P. F. WHICH 
SAYS BRITAIN HAS NEVER GOTTEN OVER 
THE FACT IT LOST CONTROL OF 
RHODESIA 
WHAT ABOUT THE MEETING RHODESIA DUE TO HAPPEN BETWEEN REGIONAL 
LEADERS IN ZAMBIA 
IT IS IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY DECENT 
CHANCE THAT THE REGIONAL STATES 
HAVE OF INFLUENCING THINGS INSIDE 
ZIMBABWE THE REGIONAL STATES HAVE 
AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY PRESSURE ON 
ZIMBABWE 
NOT THINK IT WILL MAKE A GREAT DEAL 
OF DIFFERENCE ROBERT MUGABE IS 
SEEN AS ANOTHER STATEMENT HE IS 
THE OLDEST OF THIS GROUP OF LEADERS 
A MAN WHO IS NOT INCLINED TO TAKE 
ORDERS TO TAKE MESSAGES FROM THOSE 
LEADERS THEY WILL APPLY PRESSURE 
TO THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM 
ZIMBABWE WHO WILL BE ATTENDING 
MUGABE WILL NOT BE THERE THEY'RE 
SENDING A DELEGATION OF SENIOR 
GOVERNMENT MINISTERS EVEN THEN 
THERE WILL BE A LIMIT AS TO HOW 
MUCH THEY CAN DO THERE WILL BE 
STRONG TALKING IN PRIVATE IN 
PUBLIC WILL SEE SOME BLAND 
STATEMENTS URGING ALL THE PARTIES 
TO RESPECT THE WILL OF DEMOCRACY 
WE ARE AT A POINT WHERE REGIONAL 
STATES FEEL THEY HAVE TO DO 
SOMETHING TO RESOLVE THIS CRISIS 
THERE ARE THREE MILLION ZIMBABWEAN IS 
LIVING OUT SIDE A COUNTRY WHICH 
KEN NOT COPE WITH THIS 
DETERIORATING CRISIS 
CAR OWNERS COULD BE FINED IF THEY 
OR THEIR PASSENGERS ARE CAUGHT ON 
C. C. T. V. DROPPING LITTER LOCAL 
COUNCILS WON THE POWER TO CHASE 
MOTORISTS WHO FLY TIP OR THROW 
LITTER AS OF THEIR WINDOWS 
A LITTER WARDEN PATROLS THE STREETS 
OF BELFAST THESE OFFICERS HAVE THE 
POWER TO ISSUE ON THE SPOT FINES OF 
UP TO EIGHTY TO THOSE THEY SEE 
DROPPING RUBBISH OR USING THE 
STREETS AS AN ASHTRAY MONEY RAISED 
FROM FIND LAST YEAR REACHED ONE POINT FIVE 
MILLION LESS THAN MOST URBAN 
COUNCILS MAKE FROM PARKING FINES 
IT IS A BLIGHT ON OUR STREETS WHICH 
SEEMS TO BE GETTING WORSE THIS 
EYESORE FLY TIPPING IS 
PARTICULAR PROBLEM COUNCILS ALSO 
WHAT THE POWER TO FIND THE OWNERS 
OF CARS IF THEY OR THEIR PASSENGERS 
DUMP WASTE LIKE THIS ALL THROW 
LITTER FROM THEIR VEHICLES RIGHT 
NOW THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THERE 
IS A LOOPHOLE THE PERPETRATORS 
THROUGH THE RUBBISH FROM THEIR CARS 
THE COUNCILS CANNOT ALWAYS 
ESTABLISH WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE NEXT 
WEEK JOAN RUDDOCK WILL MEET WITH 
LOCAL COUNCILLORS TO DISCUSS WHAT 
CAN BE DONE 
THE WORLD'S SEVEN RICHEST COUNTRIES 
HAVE GIVEN BANKS ONE HUNDRED DAYS TO REVEAL 
HOW MUCH MONEY THE CREDIT CRUNCH 
HAS COST THEM A MEETING OF THE G. SEVEN 
FINANCE MINISTERS ALSO CALLED FOR 
THE BANKS TO MAKE PUBLIC HOW MUCH 
WHAT THEY COULD LOSE AND TO BOOK 
IMPROVE BRISKER C. D.'S 
THE BUCK STOPS WITH THEM FINANCE 
MINISTERS AND CENTRAL BANKERS FROM 
THE WORLD'S TOP SEVEN ECONOMIES 
THEY CAME TO WASHINGTON TO FIND A 
WAY TO STOP ANOTHER CREDIT CRUNCH 
BANK BOARD ROOMS HAVE BEEN BUFFETED 
BY TURBULENCE IN THE FINANCIAL 
MARKETS THE MINISTERS GAVE THEM 
ONE HUNDRED DAYS TO REVEAL HOW MUCH THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH HAS COST THEM THEY 
ARE ASKING BANKS TO BE MORE OPEN 
ABOUT WHERE THEIR MONEY IS INVESTED 
THE CHANCELLOR SAYS MAKING BANKS 
MORE TRANSPARENT IT IS THE WAY TO 
CALM TROUBLED WATERS 
IF ACTION CAN 
BE TAKEN AT AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL 
TO IMPROVE REGULATION THEY SHOULD 
DO THAT WE ALSO WANT TO ENCOURAGE 
BANKS TO DISCLOSE THE LOSSES THEY 
MAY HAVE SUSTAINED SO THEY CAN 
RESTORE CONFIDENCE 
IT IS 
CONFIDENCE WHICH MANY ECONOMISTS 
BELIEVE IS THE SILVER BULLET WHICH 
COULD STOP A RECESSION IN ITS 
TRACKS IT IS LACKING AT THE MOMENT 
YESTERDAY'S YESTERDAY THE STOCK 
MARKET DROPPED ALL OVER THE WORLD 
BRITISH MORTGAGE LENDERS HAVE 
WARNED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THEY MAY ONLY LEND 
HALF WHAT THEY DID LAST YEAR IT IS 
THESE NERVES WHICH CAN SEND 
CONSUMER COTTON'S INTO FREEFALL IN 
AMERICA IT IS THAT ITS LOWEST LEVEL 
FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS THE G. SEVEN PLAN IS MEANT

REDUCE MEASURES TO HELP MILLIONS OF 
LOW PAID WORKERS AFFECTED BY THE 
ABOLITION OF THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE 
THE GENERAL SECRETARY HAS WARNED 
THE IMPACT OF THE NEW SYSTEM GIVING 
DENIS TAX BREAKS TO THE RICH IS 
CAUSING RESENTMENT AMONG ORDINARY 
WORKERS WORKERS BUT THE BIGGEST AIRLINE IN THE U. S. 
AMERICAN AIRLINES SAYS IT HOPES TO 
GET SERVICES BACK TO NORMAL THIS 
WEEKEND AFTER CANCELLING THREE THOUSAND 
FLIGHTS THIS WEEK FOR SAFETY CHECKS 
THE AIRLINE SAYS THREE QUARTERS OF 
ITS M. D. EIGHTY AIRCRAFT HAD BEEN 
INSPECTED FOR WIRING FAULTS THE 
REMAINDER SHOULD RETURN TO SERVICE

THE UN ESTIMATES TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN KILLED IN DARFUR SINCE 
FIGHTING BROKE OUT FIVE YEARS AGO 
THIS WEEKEND A NEW CAMPAIGN IS 
BEING LAUNCHED TO HIGHLIGHT THE 
PROBLEMS STILL BEING CAUSED BY THE 
CONFLICT AND TO CALL FOR MORE HELP 
FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN 
LEFT WITHOUT PARENTS OR HOMES 
TO A WORLD THAT COULD HAVE A 
FURTHER APART THIS WEEKEND 
CELEBRITIES ARE COMING TOGETHER 
WITH AID AGENCIES TO CALL FOR 
ACTION IN DARFUR IN AN OPEN LETTER 
CHILDREN'S AUTHORS WANT THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO DEMAND 
AN IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE FULL 
DEPLOYMENT OF THE UN PEACEKEEPING 
FORCE OTHER CELEBRITIES LIKE MATT 
DAMON AND JEMIMA KHAN ARE FRONTING 
A T. V. CAMPAIGN IN WHICH THEY SMASHED 
TOYS TO SYMBOLISE A CHILD HAD UNDER

CHILDREN IN DARFUR HAVE DRAWN 
PICTURES OF VILLAGES ON FIRE 
PEOPLE BEING SHOT AND WOMEN BEING 
TIED UP THE UN ESTIMATES AT 
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE DIED ALREADY IN 
THE CONFLICT TWENTY FIVE MILLION ARE 
HOMELESS THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE 
CAMPAIGN WANT THE WORLD TO DO

UNION HAS GOT TO BE DEPLOYED IT 
HAS TO BE GIVEN ENOUGH PETROL TO 
RUN THEIR VEHICLES ENOUGH WATER 
FOR THE SOLDIERS IT HAS TO BE 
DEPLOYED TO PROTECT THE CIVILIANS 
FIVE YEARS ON AND THE WAR IS RAGING 
CAMPAIGNERS HOPE TOMORROW'S EVENT 
WILL DRAW ATTENTION TO THE CHILDREN 
OF THE REGION WHO HAVE NEVER KNOWN 
PEACE PEACE TO REMIND YOU WE WILL BE JOINED BY 
JASON ISAACS FROM THE HARRY POTTER 
FILMS FOR MORE ON THAT CAMPAIGN 
AT TOP STORIES THERE 
PUBS WHICH ONLY OFFER LARGE GLASSES 
OF WINE TO CUSTOMERS ARE 
ENCOURAGING IRRESPONSIBLE DRINKING 
THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS 
SAYS IN THE SMALLEST CLASSES 
AVAILABLE IN MANY PARTS THEY WOULD 
PLACE DRIVERS OVER THE LEGAL LIMIT 
NICK BISH IS FROM THE ASSOCIATION 
OF LICENSED MULTIPLE RETAILERS THE 
TRADE ORGANISATION WHICH REPRESENTS 
LICENSEES BECKY FOR JOINING US 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT CLERKS THE 
BIGGEST OF THE THREE AND THE 
QUANTITY OF WINE IN IT DO YOU 
REALLY THINK WE NEED GLASSES THAT 
BIG IN PUBS 
ABSOLUTELY YOU NEED 
THEM BECAUSE IT IS ALL ABOUT 
CUSTOMER CHOICE THE ONE IN THE 
MIDDLE IS THE MOST POPULAR THE ONE 
ON THE LEFT IS THE SMALLER ONE FOR 
STRONGER WIND IT IS HISTORICAL 
NOT MUCH CHOICE FOR THAT 
CAN YOU 
HONESTLY SAY IF YOU WERE TO GO 
INTO A BAR AND QUITE A FEW BARS 
THE LARGER CLASS ONE THIRD OF A 
BOTTLE OF WINE IN ONE GLASS CAN 
YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING THERE AND YOU 
WOULD BE HAPPY THAT IS THE ONLY 
CHOICE YOU COULD HAVE 
NO I WOULD 
NOT 
AND AS A 
VET 
OUR INDUSTRY I 
WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO HAVE A 
CHOICE 
BUT THAT DOES HAPPEN ONE CHOICE IN SIXTEEN PUBS SERVE ONLY THAT MEASURE 
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IT IS WHERE THEY 
PLACE WIDE IN THE IMPORTANCE OF 
THINGS IF ONE IS A SIDELINE THEN 
HAVE BEER AND COCKTAIL BAR THEY 
MAY HAVE ONLY ONE CHOICE ARE WE 
NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT IT IT IS 
NOT A SENSIBLE MARKETING DECISION 
NOT A GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE 
DECISION TO ONLY GIVE ONE CHOICE 
IT IS LIKE SAYING WE ONLY CAN GIVE 
A PINT OF BEER AND NOT HALF A PRIDE 
YOU ARE SAYING IT IS A BAD CUSTOMER 
CHOICE DECISION WOULD IT NOT BE 
IRRESPONSIBLE TO HAVE ONLY THOSE 
LARGE GLASSES BEING SERVED NO NO BECAUSE THERE IS FREE CHOICE IN IN THAT COURT IN THAT CASE YOU 
WOULDN'T HAVE A CHOICE ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY AND IT IS BAD MARKETING 
ISN'T IT 
IRRESPONSIBLE 
NOBODY IS TIME IRRESPONSIBLE ANYONE DOWN TO TAKE THAT DRINK 
THERE ARE DIFFERENT STRENGTHS OF 
WINE AS WELL PEOPLE DO NOT SAY YOU 
SHOULD NOT BE SERVING STRONG 
BOTTLES OF WINE ONLY THIS IS ALL 
ABOUT CHOICE IT IS MORE TO DO WITH 
MARKETING CUSTOMER SERVICE THAN 
TO DO WITH IRRESPONSIBILITY 
IT IS A FAIR POINT YOU'RE MAKING 
AND PICKED UP BY PEOPLE SAYING IT 
IS PEOPLE'S RESPONSIBILITY NOT TO 
CHOOSE THE BIG GLASS OF WINE THIS 
ONE CAME IN SUPERSIZE MEASURES ARE 
MANIPULATION BY THE DRINKS INDUSTRY 
IT GOES ON TO SAY BUT THEN PEOPLE 
CAN SAY NO THANKS THAT'S A 
MEASURED RESPONSE BUT PEOPLE CAN 
AGREE WITH YOU IT IS GOOD TO HAVE 
CHOICE AND THEY CAN THINK THE PUBS 
ARE RIPPING YOU OFF BECAUSE THEY'RE 
GETTING MORE PROFIT FROM THE BIG 
GLASS THAT'S TRUE ISN'T IT MORE MORE PROFIT IN CASH TERMS MORE TAKINGS 
BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT THE 
SPOIPT TO KEEP THE CUSTOMERS HAPPY 
IT IS PROBABLY BETTER VALUE TO HAVE 
THE BIGGER WE'RE IN THE WORLD OF 
BIG CERTAIN BETTER THE TKWRANDA 
LAT TA AND IT APPLIES TO WINE AS 
WELL 
YOU'RE SAYING THE WORLD IS WELL BETTER FOR THAT WHY 
IT IS CHOICE 
CUSTOMERS WANT CHOICE IF WE COULD 
BE HAVING A PROGRAMME SAYING FOR 
GOODNESS SAKE YOU ONLY HAVE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE ML 
MEASURES PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY 
GOING TO THE BAR AND WHY ARE THE 
PUBS GOING 
THE CHOICE ARGUMENT IS 
FUNNY BECAUSE DID YOU ASK ANYONE 
BEFORE YOU PROVIDED THE ENORMOUS 
GLASSES OF WINE Z. YOU ACTUALLY ASK 
IF ANYONE WANTED IT OR DID YOU PUT 
THEM THERE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
PEOPLE ASK ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS 
WHAT THEY WANT AND ARE THEY HAPPY 
AND WITH MARKETING YOU TRY THINGS 
OUT YOU TRY THE BIGGER FASTER 
WINE STRONGER WINE DIFFERENT WAYS 
OF MARKETING AND TALKING TO YOUR 
CUSTOMERS 
HOW ABOUT THE TWO POINT CUSTOMERS PINT PINT GLASS MAYBE THERE'S A 
MARKET FOR IT 
YOU WON'T FIND MANY 
SO I SUSPECT THERE ISN'T A MARKET 
FOR IT WORTH EXPLORING AND 
OFFERING 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF OFFERING YOU'VE COMMENTS ON THAT STORY ALL 
THE WAYS OF GETTING IN TOUCH ARE ON 
THE SCREEN THIS IS BREAKFAST FROM 
B. B. C. NEWS THE HEADLINES THIS 
MORNING MORNING SUPERSIZE DRINKS IN PUBS ARE 
PUSHING CUSTOMERS INTO UNSAFE 
LEVELS OF DRINKING AS YOU'VE BEEN 
HEARING ACCORDING TO THE ROYAL 
COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS 
GORDON BROWN WARNED ROBERT MUGABE 
THE WORLD IS RUNNING OUT OF 
PATIENCE WITH HIS REGIME HE SAID 
HE CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S TAKE 
SOMETHING LONG TO ANNOUNCE THE 
RESULT OF LAST MONTH'S PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION STILL TO COME 
THE COST OF A GOOD DEAL WE LOOK AT 
WHETHER PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITES 
LOOK AFTER CONSUMERS OR COMPANIES 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE WEATHER 
NOW 
NOW HI GOOD MORNING IT IS 
TYPICALLY APRIL OVER THE PAST 
COUPLE OF DAYS WE'VE HAD SPELLS OF 
SUNSHINE AND ALSO SHOWERS THAT 
SAME MIXTURE CONTINUES TODAY BY 
NINE A M. SHOWERS PRACTISING OUT ACROSS 
DEVON AND CORNWALL BECOMING 
HEAVIER AS THE DAY GOES ON THE 
SHOWERS REASONABLY LIGHT BUT WE 
COULD SEE THE ODD HEAVY ONE 
INTERSPERSED BY SPELLS OF SUNSHINE 
CHILLY START ACROSS NORTHERN 
IRELAND AND MAINLY DRY WITH 
SUNSHINE BUT SHOWERS HERE TOO FOR 
THE MIDDLE PART OF THE DAY NORTH 
OF SCOTLAND DRY START BUT RAIN AND 
SLEET AND SNOW ALONG THE SOUTH OF 
THE COUNTRY MAYBE A TEMPORARY 
COVERING PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE 
HIGH GROUND NORTHERN ENGLAND A 
SNOW THAT WILL MELT AWAY AS THE 
SUN GETS TO WORK SOUTH OF THAT 
EAST MIDLANDS AND SOUTH EAST IT IS 
NOT TOO BAD SHOWERS HEAVY AT TIMES 
DEVELOPING INTO THE AFTERNOON THE 
RAIN SLEET AND SNOW ACROSS 
SOUTHERN PARTS OF SCOTLAND WILL 
GRADUALLY BREAK UP AND PUSH INTO 
NORTHERN ENGLAND SHOWERS START TO 
BUBBLE UP AS THE DAY GOES ON HEFTY 
SHOWERS WITH HAIL AND THUNDER 
POSSIBLE ACROSS SOUTHERN PARTS OF 
ENGLAND NORTHERN IRELAND BUT 
SHOWERS ELSEWHERE TOO A COOL DAY 
ARE FOR THE EAST OF SCOTLAND A LOT 
OF CLOUD ON SHORE BREEZE 
TEMPERATURES GENERALLY INTO WHERE 
ELSE OVERNIGHT SHOWERS WILL DIE 
AWAY A CLUSTER OF SHOWERS WILL 
MOVE INTO WALES AND SOUTH WESTERN 
PARTS OF ENGLAND ELSEWHERE IT 
SHOULD BE MAINLY DRY AND DYING 
ELSEWHERE A CHILLY NIGHT TONIGHT 
TEMPERATURES DROPPING DOWN TO TWO TO THREE 
DEGREES LOW ENOUGH FOR GROUND 
FROST AND AN ODD ICY PATCH 
TOMORROW MORNING CHILLY START TO 
THE DAY WE'LL BLOSSOM AS WE GO 
THROUGHOUT TOMORROW THAT WILL MEAN 
GHEG GENERAL IT'S A MIXTURE OF 
SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE IN THE RANGE 
OF EIGHT TO FOURTEEN DEGREES AS FOR THE 
MARATHON IF YOU'RE UP EARLY IT 
MAY START DRY SHOWERS DEVELOPING 
BECOMING WIDESPREAD AND WE COULD 
SEE ONE OR TWO HEAVY ONES FOR THE 
LATE STRAGGLERS 
MONDAY BRIGHT SUNSHINE BUT 
SHOWERS DEVELOPING MAYBE MORE 
PERSISTENT RAIN BY THE END OF THE 
DAY TEMPERATURES SEASONABLE IN 
THE RANGE OF EIGHT TO ONE DEGREES THANK 
YOU 
NOW HIGH ENERGY BILLS ARE 
PROPERTYING THOUSANDS OF US TO SHOP 
AROUND FOR BETTER DEALS FOR MANY 
THE QUICKEST WAY OF DOING SO IS TO 
USE A PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITE BUT 
DO THEY OFFER THE BEST PRICES 
EXPERTS SAY THE ADVICE THEY GIVE IS 
SKEWED BY FINANCIAL INCENTIVES AND 
CALLS FOR AN INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY 
TO OVERSEE OR TAKE OVER RUNNING 
THEM THEM THE MESSAGE FROM THE COMPARISON 
SITES IS SIMPLE THEY'LL SHOP AROUND 
FOR THE BEST DEALS SO WE DON'T HAVE 
TO THAT SAVES US TIME AND MORE 
IMPORTANTLY MONEY OFF OUR BILLS 
BUT THEY CAN ALSO MAKE MILLIONS FOR 
THE COMPANIES THAT RUN THEM 
ALTHOUGH THEY WON'T TELL US HOW 
MUCH ALMOST ALL OF THEM CHARGE 
BANKS AND UTILITIES EITHER EVERY 
TIME WE SWITCH OR EVERY TIME WE 
CLICK TO THEIR SITES 
NOW THERE ARE CALLS FOR BETTER 
REGULATION 
THERE ARE INCENTIVES REGULATION THERE WHICH WILL TEND TO SKEW THE 
INFORMATION THAT THEY GIVE TO 
CONSUMERS AND FOR CONSUMERS TO BE 
CONFIDENT THEY'RE GETTING ADVICE 
THAT'S RIGHT FOR THEM RATHER THAN 
ADVICE THAT'S RIGHT FOR THE 
COMPARISON WEBSITE IT IS GOOD TO 
HAVE AN INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY WHO 
CAN MAKE SURE THE INFORMATION IS 
IMPARTIAL OR PERHAPS RUN THE 
WEBSITE THEMSELVES 
SO DO THE SITE ALWAYS OFFER THE 
BEST DEAL ADRIAN DOESN'T THINK SO 
HE'S LOOKING TO SWITCH HIS GAS AND 
ELECTRICITY SUPPLIER 
IF I LOOKED AT TWO OR THREE 
COMPARISON WEBSITES THE SAME 
DETAILS I ENTER IN ONE DOESN'T 
GIVE ME THE SAME RESULTS OF THE 
SAME DEAL ON THE OTHER WEBSITES 
THIS RAISED ALARM BELLS AS TO WHAT 
INFORMATION THE RESULTS ARE BASED 
ON 
A VOLUNTARY ACCREDITATION CODE ON WAS INTRODUCED SO PRICE COMPARISON 
SITES WOULD INCLUDE ALL GAS AND 
ELECTRICITY COMPANIES EVEN THOSE 
THAT DID NOT PAY WHEN CONSUMERS 
SWITCHED IT SEEMS NEWEST ENERGY 
SUPPLIERS AREN'T ALWAYS LISTED AND 
THE CODE DOESN'T COVER THINGS LIKE 
CREDIT CARDS INSURANCE AND 
SAVINGS ACCOUNTS RESEARCH CARRIED 
OUT BAY FINANCIAL MCZEELING 
REVEALED INTERESTING RESULTS IT 
SHOPPED AROUND FOR HOME INSURANCE 
A CREDIT CARD AND TRAVEL INSURANCE 
USING DIFFERENT SITES IN EVERY 
CASE EACH COMPARISON SITE CAME ONE 
A DIFFERENT DEAL THAT IT SAID WAS 
THE BEST 
THEY'RE BRANDED AS BEING 
THE CONSUMER CHAMPION AND THEY'LL 
GET THE BEST DEAL WHAT PEOPLE 
DON'T REALISE IS THEY'RE COMMERCIAL 
ENTERPRISES AND THESE WEBSITES WILL 
HAVE COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH 
THE PROVIDERS AND THEY'RE IN THE 
BUSINESS OF MAKING MONEY SO WE'D 
LIKE THE WEBSITES TO BE UP FRONT 
ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY EARN FROM THE 
PROVIDERS 
THE COMPARISON SITE PROVIDERS REJECT THE ACCUSATIONS OF BIAS NEW 
SWITCH IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST IT 
SAYS WITHOUT SITES LIKE ITS OWN 
CONSUMERS WOULD BE WORSE OFF 
I CAN 
GUARANTEE IF SOMEBODY COMES ON OUR 
SITE AND PUTS INFORMATION IN THEY 
WILL SAVE MONEY AND THE SAVINGS 
CAN BE SIGNIFICANT 
THE FINANCIAL 
REGULATOR THE F. S. A. IS LOOKING AT 
THE WAY COMPARISON SITES RECOMMEND 
BEST INSURANCE BUYS THERE'S NO 
SIGN OF WIDESPREAD REGULATION JUST 
YET IN THE MEANTIME THE ADVICE IS 
TO SHOPPING AROUND SEVERAL 
DIFFERENT COMPARISON SITES AND 
REALISE THE BEST DEAL MAY NOT BE AS 
GOOD AS IT LOOKS 
WE'LL BE TALKING TO A COMPANY ABOUT 
THIS AFTER NINE HUNDRED IF YOU HAVE ANY 
QUESTIONS PLEASE LET US KNOW NOW 
IN A MOMENT THE WRITER AND 
BROADCASTER EVE POLLARD WILL TALK 
US THROUGH ABOUT THE NEWSPAPERS 
BUT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE FRONT 
PAGES 
PAGES DAILY TELEGRAPH WE HAVE A 
STORY HERE ABOUT COUNCIL SPY CASES 
HIT ONE THOUSAND A MONTH SURVEILLANCE 
CAMERAS PICKING UP DOG FALLING AND 
UNDERAGE SMOKING IT'S BIG BROTHER 
IN YOUR AREA 
TIMES VAGUELY LINKED STORY FINES 
FOR LITTER BUGS AGAIN USE OF C. C. T. V. 
CAMERAS THESE ARE THE POSSIBILITY 
LOCAL COUNCILS COULD USE PICTURES 
FROM C. C. T. V. TO CATCH PEOPLE FOR 
EXAMPLE THEY DRIVE ALONG DROP 
THEIR RUBBISH OUT OF THE CAR THEY 
SHOULD TRIAL THAT SYSTEM IS THE 
IDEA DAILY MIRROR MORE ON THE 
MCCANNS THERE IN A FURY ABOUT 
THEIR STATEMENTS BEING LEAKED BY 
PORTUGAL'S POLICE AND THE STORY 
MAKES THE FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY 
EXPRESS TALKING ABOUT OUR MISTAKE 
TALKING ABOUT GERRY AND KATE 
MCCANN ANGRY AND THEY'RE SAYING 
THEY WERE IF YOU LIKE MADE TO 
RELIVE THE MOMENT ONCE AGAIN 
BECAUSE OF THE LEAKS FROM THE 
PORTUGUESE POLICE THEY CAME FRONT 
PAGE OF THE INDEPENDENT WE WERE 
MENTIONING THIS EARLIER CREDIT 
CRUNCH DOMINATING G. SEVEN MEETING BUT 
THE REAL ISSUE IS THE SPIRALLING 
COST OF BASIC FOODS RICE HAS GONE 
UP WHICH IS A CONCERN FOR A LOT OF 
PEOPLE EVE NOW WHOSE NOSE IS IN 
THE STORY 
I HAVE TO START WITH THE 
DAILY TELEGRAPH STORY IT SEEMS 
BECAUSE OF THERE WAS NEW 
LEGISLATION PUT IN SO TERRORISTS OR 
POSSIBLE TERRORISTS COULD BE 
WATCHED BY YOUR LOCAL COUNCIL 
SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT IDEA BUT THE 
LOCAL COUNCIL IS NOT WATCHING 
TERRORISTS THEY'RE WATCHING PEOPLE 
WHO LET THEIR DOGS FOUL THE 
PAVEMENT THEY'RE WATCHING PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE UNDERAGE SMOKING AND 
THEY'RE WATCHING PEOPLE WHO ARE 
PUTTING THEIR RUBBISH INTO SKIPS 
AND THINGS LIKE THAT IF FACT OVER 
A THOUSAND A MONTH TWELVE THOUSAND A YEAR 
INVESTIGATIONS ARE GOING ON THEY 
CAN LOOK AT YOUR PHONE RECORDS 
LOOK AT WHAT WEBSITES YOU'RE 
LOOKING ON YOUR COMPUTER AND WHAT 
IS INTERESTING IS SURVEILLANCE 
REQUESTS BY COUNCIL HAS GONE UP 
AND SURVEILLANCE REQUEST BY POLICE 
HAVE GONE DOWN 
ON THE FACE OF IT 
I'M SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD 
AGREE IT SOUNDS VERY WORRYING BUT 
CAN YOU CONCEIVE OF ANY SITUATION 
WHERE YOU LIVE IN YOUR LOCAL AREA 
WHERE YOU WOULD THINK IT WAS WORTH 
DOING THAT TO GO TO THOSE LENGTHS 
ARE YOU SEWER THERE'S NOTHING I I THINK THIS IS RIGHT FOR TERRORISM 
IF YOU FEEL SOMEBODY'S PUTTING 
FERTILISER OR STASHING UP THINGS 
THAT COULD BE USED TO MAKE BOMBS 
IT IS RIGHT IT IS DISGRACEFUL WHEN 
PEOPLE LET DOGS FOUL THE PAVEMENT 
I DON'T THINK I WANT TO LIVE IN A 
COUNTRY WHERE LOCAL COUNCIL CAN 
SPY ON YOU WE HAD THE CASE IN 
DORSET WHERE THEY WERE SPYING ON A 
COUPLE TO CHECK WHETHER THEY WERE 
RIGHT TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO A 
SCHOOL THIS IS STASI THE END OF 
THE BEGINNING OF PRIVACY WHAT WHAT ABOUT LITTER S. THAT LEGITIMATE 
C. C. T. V. CAMERAS IF YOU DROP YOUR HAND 
OUT 
C. C. T. V. I THINK LITTER IS OUT DISGUSTING AND C. C. T. V. FOR CAMERAS 
THERE'S MANY CAMERAS AROUND AS WE 
DISCOVER YOU CAN BE CAUGHT ALL 
OVER THE PLACE 
YOU'RE MAKING A 
DISTINCTION THERE 
ABSOLUTELY AM 
AND IN FACT THE CAMERAS THERE AND 
IT CATCHES ANYBODY DUTCHING LITTER 
I'M ALL FOR THAT L. ALSO THINK WE 
NEED TO DO MORE TO MAKE US FEEL 
THAT DROPPING LITTER IS DISGUSTING 
WE SHOULD MAKE IT ANTI SMOKING 
GUARDIAN 
THERE'S A STORY IN THE GUARDIAN GUARDIAN I'M ON THE SIDE OF BABIES 
THIS MORNING A WOMAN WHO WORKED AS 
A HOUSING OFFICIAL HERE SHE HER 
CHILD WENT TO LIVE WITH HER 
EXHUSBAND SHE LOST HER HOUSING 
PRIORITY AND SHE'S SMUGGLED A 
BABY IN FROM NIGERIA WHICH SHE 
PAID BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MINUS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SO SHE CAN 
GET PRIORITY HOUSING SHE'S 
PROBABLY GOING TO JAIL BUT NOBODY 
CAN FIND THE PARENTS OF THIS BABY 
BROUGHT OVER FROM NIGERIA WHICH 
SHE SAID SHE'D ACORPORATED THERE 
ARE SEVERAL THINGS WRONG WITH THE 
STORY NUMBER ONE IT IS OUTRAGEOUS 
THAT PEOPLE ARE TRAFFICKING BABIES 
AT ALL THE FACT SHE'S BRINGING A 
BABY IN TO GET HERSELF BACK IN THE 
HOUSING SITUATION SHE WANTS TO 
SEEMS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT 
AND THE IDEA BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE 
ADMINISTER BENEFITS AND STUFF 
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BRING IN A BABE 
TKPWRI A FOREIGN COUNTRY AWAY FROM 
ITS PARENTS SEEMS HORRENDOUS 
ANOTHER BABY STORY FROM THE DAILY

YOU GET UPSET AND YOU NEVER KNOW 
WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARDS L. DON'T 
KNOW WHETHER YOU REMEMBER THERE WAS

IN THE RIGHT POSITION SHE RECKONS 
ABOUT NINE AND A HALF HOURS TO GET 
AROUND THERE 
COUNCILS COULD BE GIVEN STRONGER 
POWERS TO FINE DRIVERS IF THEY OR 
THEIR PASSENGERS THROW RUBBISH OUT 
OF CARS ONE OF A SERIES OF NEW 
MEASURES LOCAL A THIRTIES HAD ASKED FOR 
TO GET TOUGH ON LETTER AND WASTE 
PAUL BETTISON DEALS WITH 
ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES FOR THE 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION IS 
THE REASON YOU ARE PUSHING FOR 
THESE NEW POWERS BECAUSE IT IS A 
PROBLEM NOT BEEN DEALT WITH AT THE 
MOMENT 
LETTER IS AN EXPENSIVE MOMENT PROBLEM LETTER FROM CARS IS ONE 
THAT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GET 
ANY KIND OF PROSECUTION CURRENTLY 
ONE WOULD HAVE TO IDENTIFY THE 
ACTUAL PERSON WITHIN A CAR HE HAS 
THROWN THE RUBBISH OUT BY THE TIME 
YOU HAVE SPOTTED THE CAR THE 
RUBBISH LEAVING THE CAR THE CAR 
HAS DRIVEN OFF 
TAKE US THROUGH THE 
IDEA AS YOU WOULD SEE IT YOU ARE 
USING EXISTING C. C. T. V. CAMERAS 
SOMEONE LOOKS TRIGGERS IMAGES ONE ONE MIGHT USE CAMERAS ONE MIGHT USE 
THE SERVICES OF TRAFFIC WARDENS 
POLICE COMMITTEE SUPPORT OFFICES 
TO SPOT THE EVENTS TAKING PLACE 
AND THEN ONE WOULD SIMPLY SEND 
PENALTY NOTICE TO THE REGISTERED 
KEEPER OF THE VEHICLE ONCE THEY 
SEE THIS NOTICE A FIXED PENALTY 
FINE THEY WOULD EITHER ACCEPT THEY 
WERE THE DRIVER AND PAY THE FINE 
OR THEY WOULD HAVE TO GIVE THE NAME 
OF THE DRIVER OR DEFENDER IN ORDER 
NOT TO HAVE TO PAY THE FINE 
THEMSELVES 
THE IDEA WAS THAT YOU THEMSELVES WOULD USED FIXED C. C. T. V. CAMERAS YOU 
WOULD NEED AN IMAGE OF THE OFFENDER 
YES YOU WOULD NEED EITHER VIDEO 
FOOTAGE OF THE OFFENCE TAKING PLACE 
OR BETTER STILL THE WITNESS OF 
SOMEONE TO BE TRUSTED SUCH AS 
TRAFFIC WARDEN 
SO SOMEONE COULD BE 
CONVICTED FOR THIS JUST BECAUSE A 
TRAFFIC WARDEN RIGHT AT A TICKET 
SAYING HE SAW SOMEONE IN THAT CAR 
DROPPING RUBBISH OUT 
THE TRAFFIC 
WARDEN CAN KINDLY GIVE THEM A FIXED 
PENALTY NOTICE FOR PARKING IN THE 
WRONG PLACE SO WHY NOT 
IT'S NOT 
SO EASY YOU CAN TAKE A PICTURE OF 
A CAR PARKED WRONGLY 
HOW ELSE 
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE A 
PROSECUTE ANYBODY FOR ANYTHING THE THE REASON FOR USING THE C. C. T. V. CAMERAS 
IS YOU GET A MOVING IMAGE SOMEBODY 
SIFTS THROUGH AN AWFUL LOT OF 
FOOTAGE 
THEN HE WOULD GET ABSOLUTE FOOTAGE PROOF THANKS TO THE CAMERAS 
THROWING RUBBISH FROM CARS IS A 
DOUBLE WHAMMY FOR COSTS TO SOCIETY 
WE KNOW PICKING UP LITTER COSTS FOR 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES YOU AND ME 
THROUGH AT TAXIS TAXES A LOT OF 
MONEY WHEN RUBBISH IS THROWN OUT 
OF CARS AND WE ALL SIT ON OUR 
ROADS ON THE CENTRAL RESERVATION 
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THESE DAYS 
BECAUSE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY IF WE 
ARE GOING TO CLEAN THOSE AREAS WE 
HAVE TO CLOSE A LANE ON THE ROAD 
WHO WILL SIFT THROUGH THESE HOURS 
OF FOOTAGE TO CATCH SOMEONE 
THAT'S RIGHT I THINK THAT IS FOR 
COUNCILS TO ASCERTAIN WHAT IS THE 
BEST USE OF RESOURCE AND CLEARLY 
YOU'RE NOT JUST GOING TO SIT 
THROUGH HOURS OF FOOTAGE YOU WOULD 
LOOK FOR SPECIFIC AREAS WHERE 
LITTER IS A PROBLEM AT SPECIFIC 
TIMES BECAUSE VERY OFTEN LITTER IS 
THROWN OUT OF CAR WHEN A CAR'S 
STATIONARY IN TRAFFIC OR 
SOMETHING WE'VE ALWAYS SEEN THIS 
AND HOW DREADFUL IT IS WE HEARD 
EARLIER TODAY HOW DREADFUL IT IS 
WHEN PEOPLE THROW OUT OF THE CAR 
FISH AND CHIP WRAPPERS OR A PIZZA 
BOX I'VE SEEN ALL THESE THINGS 
COME OUT OF A CAR 
THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH YOU'RE WATCHING BREAKFAST

LEVELS OF DRINKING ACCORDING TO THE 
ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS GORDON

THEY'RE COMING HEAVY IN THE MIDDLE 
PART OF THE AFTERNOON MAINLY DRY

THOUGHT TOMORROW THANK YOU TIME 
FOR NEWSWATCH AND SOME VIEWERS 
THOUGHT THE COVERAGE OF THE OLYMPIC 
TORCH RELAY FOCUSED TOO MUCH ON THE 
PROTEST AND NOT ON THE PARADE 
WELCOME TO NEWSWATCH THIS WEEK 
DID THE B. B. C.'S COVERAGE OF THE 
OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY FOCUS TOO MUCH 
ON THE PROTESTS AND LAY OFF THE 
MIDDLE CLASSS SAYS ONE VIEWER THEY 
HAVE FEELINGS TOO ON SUNDAY THE 
OLYMPIC FLAME WOUND ITS WAY AROUND 
LONDON AND NEWS TWENTY FOUR WAS WITH IT 
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY PROTESTS OF 
PEOPLE OPPOSED TO CHINA'S PRESENCE 
IN TIBET HAD BEEN EXPECT AND THE 
B. B. C. WAS WELL PREPARED 
THERE YOU 
SEE THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER LET OFF 
AND THE POLICE MOVE IN WE REALLY 
THINK THAT AND ALSO THERE'S ANOTHER 
INCIDENT WE CAN SHOW YOU THIS IS 
SOMEBODY COMES UP WITH A FLAG 
AGAIN THEY'RE WRESTLED TO THE 
GROUND 
AS THE TORCH CHANGES HANDS GROUND NOW NO SIGN OF THE TROUBLE WE'VE 
SEEN BEFORE 
I WAS GOING TO 
IDENTIFY THEM BEFORE THEY MAKE THE 
MOVE WHICH IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR 
THE POLICE TO WORK OUT WHO IS A 
TROUBLEMAKER AND WHO IS NOT SOME SOME VIEWERS FELT IT WAS ALMOST AS IF 
THE B. B. C. WAS WILLING THE IN 
ACCIDENTS TO HAPPEN KEN NEATH SAID 
THE CAMERA WORK CONCENTRATED TOO 
MUCH ON THE DEMONSTRATORS TRYING 
TO TAKE HOLD OF THE TORCH AND SPOIL 
THE WHOLE PARADE THE CAMERA WORK 
SHOULD HAVE SHOWN A LITTLE MORE OF 
THE PEOPLE WHO TURNED OUT ON THE 
PAYMENTS TO ENJOY WHAT SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN A PLEASANT PARADE THROUGH 
LONDON HILLARY SAID HER 
GRANDDAUGHTER HAD TAKEN PART IN A 
BIG DISPLAY IN THE FESTIVAL HALL 
GRANDDAUGHTER HAD TAKEN PART IN A BIG DISPLAY IN THE FESTIVAL HALL 
SUE YOU WERE THE EDITOR IN CHARGE 
THAT DAY WHAT ABOUT THE COMPLAINT 
YOU FOCUSED TOO MUCH ON THE 
PROTESTS ON THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS ON 
WHAT MIGHT A HAPPY OCCASION WE WE FOCUSED ON THE PROTESTS WE PLANNED 
THERE WOULD BE WE ASSUMED THERE 
WOULD BE PROTESTS BUT EQUALLY IF 
THERE HADN'T BEEN IF THERE WAS 
CHEERING CROWDS IN THE STREETS AND 
HORDES OF THEM WE WOULD HAVE 
REFLECTED THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT 
HAPPENED 
THERE'S TWO CONFLICTING HAPPENED ELEMENTS THE TORCH PROCESSION 
OLYMPIC IDEAL AND PROTESTERS TRYING 
TO HIJACK IT FOR THEIR OWN 
PURPOSES HOW DO YOU BALANCE THOSE 
TWO IN THE LIVE COVERAGE 
YOU CAN 
PLAN FOR IT AND WE DID PLAN FOR 
THOSE PROTESTS EQUALLY WE HAD TO 
SHOW WHAT WE SAW AND WE HAD LIVE 
COVERAGE THROUGHOUT THE DAY OF 
PROTESTS IT WAS UNPREDICTABLE IT 
WAS VOLATILE AND ONE PRODUCER SAID 
THERE WASN'T A SINGLE MOMENT HE 
DIDN'T THINK WHERE HE DIDN'T HEAR 
ABUSE SHOUTED THE TONE OF THE DAY 
WAS SET HOW DO YOU BALANCE THAT 
WITH PEOPLE INTERESTED SUPPORTERS 
CHEERING CROWDS PEOPLE WHO WANT TO 
SEE AN EVENT IN WE TRIED TO DO THAT 
WHENEVER I SAW THE LIGHTER SIDE IT 
IT DANCING DRAGONS I MADE AN 
ATTEMPT TO BRING THOSE IN VIEWERS VIEWERS HAD A LOT OF COMMENTS BUT COMING 
FROM DITCH POINTS OF VIEW ONE 
VIEWER THOUGHT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH 
HEARD FROM THE PROCHINA CAMP HE 
SAID 
IS THAT A FAIR COMMENT 
WELL WE DID 
DID INTERVIEW PEOPLE ON THE PRO 
CHINA SIDE OF IT WE INTERVIEWED 
SOME CHINESE STUDENTS AND TRIED TO 
INTERVIEW THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR 
WHICH SHE DECLIEPD BUT WE 
INTERVIEWED SOMEBODY FROM THE 
CHINESE EMBASSY 
ANOTHER VIEWER 
NOTED THE USE IN THE COVERAGE OF 
THE TERM TROUBLEMAKERS TO 
DESCRIBE PROTESTS WAS THAT IN 
RETRO SPECT REASONABLE LANGUAGE 
WHEN IT IS LIVE EVENT OUR 
REPORTERS WAS REPORTING ON 
SOMETHING THAT WAS HAPPENING IN 
FRONT OF THEM AND SOMETIMES THEY 
MIGHT USE A WORD THEY WOULDN'T 
OTHERWISE WOULD YOU SAY HAD IT BEEN 
SCRIPTED OR HAD THEY THOUGHT ABOUT 
IT BUT THERE WERE DIFFERENT TYPES 
OF PROTESTERS IT WASN'T JUST A 
MATTER OF PEOPLE STANDING THERE 
WITH BANNERS AND CHILDREN WAVING 
FLAGS WITH FREE TIBET THEY WERE 
THERE WITH DIFFERENT AXES TO 
TKWRIEND 
AGAIN ON THE USE OF TKWRIEND LANGUAGE THAT VIEWERS PICKED UP ON 
KATY 
AGAIN HAVE YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL 
WITH MAYBE SWEEPING USE OF 
LANGUAGE 
I HOPE WE DIDN'T SAY LANGUAGE ANTI CHINESE PEOPLE IF WE DID 
THAT WOULD BE CLEARLY WRONG 
BECAUSE PEOPLE WEREN'T THERE 
AGAINST THE CHINESE PEOPLE IT IS 
AN UMBRELLA TERM THEY WERE ANTI 
CHINA IN TERMS OF ANTI CHINA 
GOVERNMENT IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT 
TIBET IT WAS ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS 
DARFUR BUT THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE 
ANTI GLOBALISATION ALL SORTS OF 
ISSUES CAME TO PLAY 
ON A FACTUAL 
POINT ANOTHER VIEWER ASKED 
THAT WOULD HAVE LOOKED PARTICULAR 
GOOD IS THERE A REASON 
YES IT 
WOOFPLT WE HAD OVER THIRTY CAMERAS OUT 
THAT DAY AND A LOT OF LIVE COVERAGE 
WE WERE PROUD OF THE COVERAGE THAT 
WE HAD BUT CHINATOWN LODGE STICLY 
WAS DIFFICULT THE STREETS WERE TOO 
NARROW WE COULDN'T GET A TRUCK IN 
THERE WE HAD A CAMERA BUT NOT A 
LIVE ONE EVENTS WERE MOVING SO 
QUICKLY WE MOVED ON FROM IT SOME SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT YOU DID TOO MUCH ON IT ONE ASKED 
THAT WAS YOUR CALL WERE YOU RIGHT 
TO DO THAT 
I THINK I WAS L. WAS IN 
CHARGE FOR THE WHOLE DAY AND 
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE PROCESSION 
STARTED THEN THERE WAS SCUFFLES 
AND ARRESTS AND WITHIN MINUTES 
REALLY I THINK TWO THINGS COME 
INTO PLAY ONE IS ARE WE TELLING 
THE VIEWERS SOMETHING NEW WHICH WE 
WERE BECAUSE SOMETHING WAS 
HAPPENING ALL THE TIME THE VIEWERS 
SAID SOME OF THEM THEY WERE GLUED 
TO IT AND TWO IS WHAT OTHER 
STORIES WERE AROUND THE OTHER ONE 
WAS THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH LEAVING 
HOSPITAL THAT WAS IN FACT WHEN THE 
TORCH WAS ON A BREAK SO I THINK 
IT WAS JUSTIFIED 
NO REGRETS NO NO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR EXPLAINING 
THAT THAT THE B. B. C. TAKES PAINS NOT TO OFFEND 
VARIOUS GROUPS TO THROUGH THE 
LANGUAGE IT USES NOT HIGHLIGHTING 
OR ETHNICITY OR SEXUALITY OR 
RESORTING TO STEREOTYPING IS WILL 
ONE GROUP IN SOCIETY THAT DOESN'T 
ENJOY SUCH PROTECTION HAVE A LOOK 
AT THIS 
WHAT THE DEVELOPERS ARE 
SAYING THEY WILL BUILD THINGS LIKE 
MORE ROADS AND NEW RAILWAY STATION 
HERE WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THE 
HOMES HERE WON'T BE THE PRESERVE OF 
MIDDLE CLASS MUESLI MUNCHERS 
THERE WILL BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
FOR ALL 
THAT REPORT FROM SOUTH 
TODAY ON THE NEW ECO VILLAGES IN 
THE REGION ANGERED THIS VIEWER I I FOUND THE REFERENCES TO MIDDLE 
CLASS MUESLI MUNCHERS VERY 
OFFENSIVE WE FORMAL FOLK WHO LIVE 
LAW ABIDING LIVES RAISE CHILDREN IN 
A STABLE ENVIRONMENT FEEL 
PERSECUTED AS LABELS SUCH AS THIS 
OUR SON IN LAW AND DAUGHTER ARE 
UNABLE TO AFFORD HOUSING AND LIVE 
IN RENT ACCOMMODATION WE'RE 
RETIRED AND UNABLE TO TAKE OUT A 
MORTGAGE ON THEIR BEHALF SO I 
REALLY OBJECT TO THE INFERENCE OF 
THIS REPORTER 
WITH HEALTHY EATING AT THE TOP OF 
MOST PEOPLE'S LIFESTYLE AGENDAS 
SHOULD WE BE USING MUESLI AS A TERM 
OF ABUSE THIS IS LAZY DER ROG 
TRIAND INSULTING JOURNALISM IF THE 
REPORTER HAD BEEN REFERRING TO 
LOCAL ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS THE 
RACE RELATIONS BOARD WOULD BE 
DEMANDING AN APOLOGY 
SO IS THERE 
AN APOLOGY TO MRS. CHURCHILL HERE'S 
WHAT THE B. B. C. TOLD US 
NOT EXACT LISTEN AN APOLOGY BUT AT 
LEAST WE CAN ADD MIDDLE CLASS 
PEOPLE TO THE LIST OF PROTECTED 
SPECIES AND IN THE B. B. C. STYLE BOOK 
LAST WEEK WE DISCUSSED THE SENDING 
OF GEORGE ALAGIAH TO COVER THE 
ZIMBABWE ELECTIONS WHEN THE B. B. C. HAD 
ANOTHER TEN OR ELEVIN REPORTERS 
TEN O'CLOCK NEWS EDITOR HAD THIS TO 
SAY 
THE PROBLEM WITH SOME OF THE SAY COMEPTS IS THEY'RE NOT REALLY 
THINKING ABOUT IT AS WE'RE THINKING 
ABOUT IT IMTHE OTHER POINT ONE WOULD 
MAKE ABOUT GEORGE IS HE IS NOT 
JUST ABOUT ANY OTHER PRESENTER THE 
IDEA OF BEING IN SOUTH AFRICA 
MEANS YOU'RE NOT PART OF THE STORY 
IS NAIVE 
WHAT A PATRONISING AND 
ARROGANT RESPONSE SAID DAVID AND 
DAVID BATES WROTE AND FROM JANE 
FINALLY YOU MAY RECALL THAT WHEN 
THE NORTHERN ROCK STORY BROKE THE 
B. B. C. LOVED TO REMIND US IT WAS THEIR

COUNT AFFAIRS PROGRAMMES YOU CAN 
CALL US ON OR E. MAIL NEWSWATCH AT 
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING TELL US 
WHAT IS ON YOUR MIND NOW 
GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO 
BREAKFAST FROM B. B. C. NEWS 
PUBS ARE IN THE FIRING LINE FOR 
SUPERSIZING OUR DRINK SENIOR 
DOCTORS SAY WE ARE BEING PUSHED 
INTO DRINKING TOO MUCH 
GOOD MORNING IT IS SATURDAY TWELFTH 
APRIL ALSO ON THE PROGRAMME OUR 
PATIENCE IS WEARING THIN GORDON 
BROWN'S MESSAGE TO ROBERT MUGABE TO 
HONOUR DEMOCRACY IN ZIMBABWE TELL 
US HOW MUCH THE CREDIT CRUNCH HAS 
REALLY COST YOU THE BANKS ARE 
GIVEN ONE HUNDRED DAY DEADLINE TO ADMIT THE 
SIZE OF THEIR LOSSES SMILE YOU 
ARE ON RUBBISH CAM COUNCILS BRING 
IN C. C. T. V. TO FINE PEOPLE WHO THROW 
LITTER OUT OF CAR WINDOWS OUR 
PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITES PUTTING 
THEIR PROFITS AHEAD OF GETTING YOU 
THE BEST DEAL AND WE WILL HAVE A 
LOOK AT THE LONG AND SHORT OF THE 
LONDON MARATHON WILL MIKE BE ABLE 
TO TAKE IT ALL IN HIS STRIDE 
SUNNY SIDE UP WITH FRIES KIDS T. V. 
WITH A FOREIGN ACCENT THE CAMPAIGN 
TO PRODUCE MORE HOME MADE 
PROGRAMMES FOR OUR CHILDREN TO 
WATCH FIRST OUR MAIN STORY 
SUPERSIZE DRINKS IN PUBS ARE 
PUSHING CUSTOMERS INTO UNSAFE 
LEVELS OF DRINKING THAT IS 
ACCORDING TO THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF 
PHYSICIANS WHICH IS ACCUSING THE 
INDUSTRY OF IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOUR 
THE ONE TWENTY FIVE M. L. S. GLASS WHICH USEDTON TO 
BE THE NORM IS ONLY USES IN ONE IN 
SIX PUBS IN SOME THE SMALLEST 
MEASURE COMES IN A TWO FIFTY M. L. GLASS 
THAT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF A THIRD 
OF A BOTTLE OF WINE A SUPERSIZE 
BAR IN A SUPERSIZED WORLD BUT IT IS 
SUPERSIZE DRINK MEASURES THAT HAVE 
BROUGHT A BACKLASH FROM POLITICIANS 
AND DOCTORS N. THE BATTLE AGAINST 
BINGE DRINKING WHILE PUB OWNERS 
STRUGGLE AGAINST THE ECONOMIC 
SQUEEZE POLITICIANS SAY THE 
INCREASING TREND TO ONLY OFFER 
LARGEST MEASURES IS CYNICAL 
PROFITEERING WHILE DOCTORS SAY IT 
IS DOWN RIGHT IRRESPONSIBLE THERE THERE IS NO DOUBT AT ALL MANY PEOPLE ARE 
DRINKING MORE THAN THEY REALISE 
MANY PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF UNITS 
THEY WANT TO STAY WITHIN SAFE LIMIT 
BUS THEY ARE BEING PUSHED UP BY NOT 
REALISING WHAT THEY ARE DRINKING 
AND I THINK IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE AND 
I THINK THE INDUSTRY HAS TO PUT ITS 
HOUSE IN ORDER 
THIS ONE TWENTY FIVE M. L. GLASS 
USED TO BE THE STANDARD SIZE IN 
MOST BARS BUT NOW JUST SIXTEEN PER CENT OF 
LICENSED PREMISES SAY THIS IS THEIR 
NORMAL SIZE MEASURE NEARLY THREE 
QUARTERS SAY THIS LARGER ONE SEVENTY FIVE M. L. IS A 
SMALL AND THIS TWO FIFTY M. L. A LARGE AND 
FOURTEEN PER CENT OF LICENSED PREMISES SAY THEY 
ONLY OFFER THIS TWO FIFTY M. L. SIZE THAT IS 
A THIRD OF A BOTTLE OF WINE MANY 
BARS HAVE ALSO INCREASED SPIRIT 
MEASURES FROM TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE M. L. AND OFFER 
DOUBLES AS STANDARD A LEADING 
INDUSTRY MAGAZINE ADVISED LANDLORDS 
TO TRAIN AND INCENTIVISE STAFF TO 
UP SELL PRODUCTS SUCH AS LARGER 
MEASURES SOME M. P.'S WANT TO CALL 
TIME ON SUPERSIZING 
IT IS PRO 
FEARING PROFITEERING IT GETTING 
PEOPLE TO TRADE UP AND THEN 
CALLING A TWO FIFTY M. L. A LARGE WHICH A 
THIRD OF A BOTTLE OF WINE NEARLY 
HALF A PINT SO ALL I AM SAYING IS 
PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE CHOICE IF 
THEY WANT A SMALL MEASURE OF WINE 
ONE TWENTY FIVE M. L. WHICH IS THE ZAN DARD SIZE 
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET IT THIS THIS THIS PUB THEY ONLY SERVE TWO FIFTY M. L. 
GLASSS OF WINE 
THE PROFIT MARGIN 
IS MORE SUBSTANTIAL THAN THERE IS 
ON A ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE 
SO DO YOU FILE THERE IS 
PRESSURE ON 
YES ME AS A GENERAL 
MANAGER HAVE TO MAKE MONEY FOR MY 
BOSS THE OWNER SO WE HAVE TO MAKE 
AS MUCH PROFIT AS WE CAN ON EACH 
PRODUCT WE SELL 
MOST WINE BARS 
DON'T GIVE YOU THE OPTION OF A 
SMALL OR LARGE THEY GO TO GIVE YOU 
A LARGE 
I DON'T THINK THEY ARE 
TRYING TO TUSH PUSH IT TOO MUCH 
THEY WILL GIVE YOU A LARGE IF THEY 
CAN OR A DOUBLE IF THEY CAN BECAUSE 
THEY ARE MAKING MORE MONEY ON IT SO 
WE NEED TO BE SMARTER AND SAY NO 
SMALL SHOTS ETC 
THE DRINK INDUSTRY 
SAYS CUSTOMERS SHOULD HAVE CHOICE 
BUT CLAIM BIGGER WRESH MEASURES 
IS WHAT THEY WANT 
WE ARE IN THE 
BUSINESS OF CUSTOMER CHOICE 
SUPERSIZING IS HERE IT HAS BEEN 
OVER FROM AMERICA FOR A LONG TIME 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT KING SIZED 
BEDS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT GRAND 
LAT TAIS AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
BEER AND WINE SIZE IS INCREASING 
BUT THE TRICK IS TO OFFER VALUE 
BUT WHATEVER MESH YOU YOU CHOOSE 
THE MESSAGE IS KNOW HOW MUCH YOU 
ARE DRINKING 
AND IN A FEW MINUTES TIME WE WILL 
TALK TO ALCOHOL CONCERN AND YOU CAN 
SEND US YOUR THOUGHTS IN THE USUAL 
WAY ALL THE DETAILS ARE ON THE 
SCREEN RIGHT NOW GORDON BROWN HAS 
WARNED ROBERT MUGABE THAT THE WORLD 
IS RUNG OUT OF PATIENCE WITH HIS 
REGIME MR. BROWN SAID HE WAS 
APPALLED BY THE SIGNS OF 
INTIMIDATION AND VIOLENCE AND 
COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT HAS 
TAKEN SO LONG TO ANNOUNCE THE 
RESULTS OF LAST MONTH'S 
PRESIDENTIAL ECTION IN 
ZIMBABWE'S CAPITAL HARARE POLICE 
HAVE BANNED POLITICAL RAL LIS AMID 
GROWING TENSION OVER THE DISPUTED 
PRESIDENTIAL VOTE THE RESULTS OF 
THE ELECTION HELD TWO WEEKS' AGO 
TODAY HAVE STILL NOT BEEN RELEASED 
IN HIS STRONGEST COMMENTS YET 
GORDON BROWN LAST NIGHT ISSUED A 
STATEMENT VOICING FRUSTRATION AT 
THE DELAY 
THERE HAD BEEN HOPES THAT A MEETING 
OF REGIONAL LEADERS COULD BREAK THE 
DEADLOCK BUT NOW THAT PRESIDENT 
MUGABE HAS APPARENTLY PULLED OUT OF 
THE MEETING THOSE HOPES ARE FADING 
BUT FOR THE OPPOSITION DEM EMDEM 
PRESSURE FROM OUTSIDERS IS 
MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE 
PRESSURE FROM OUTSIDERS IS THE MAIN 
HOPE 
OUR HOPE IS THEY WILL BE ABLE HOPE TO USE THEIR POLITICAL INFLUENCE ON 
PRESIDENT MUGABE TO CONCEDE DEFEAT 
BECAUSE THAT ELECTION WAS WON BY 
M. D. C. AND THEREFORE I THINK THE ONLY 
LOGICAL THING IS TO HAVE A PEACEFUL 
TRANSITION OF POWER 
SO FAR THERE 
HAS BEEN NO RESPONSE FROM PRESIDENT 
MUGABE TO GORDON BROWN'S COMMENTS 
BUT IN THE PAST HE HAS REACTED 
ANGRYLY TO WHAT HE SEES AS 
INTERFERENCE FROM ZIMBABWE'S FORMER 
COLONIAL POWER CAR OWNERS COULD BE 
FINED IF THEY OR THEIR PASSENGERS 
ARE CAUGHT ON C. C. T. V. CAMERAS DROPPING 
LITTER LOCAL COUNCILS WANT THE 
POWER TO CHASE UP MOTORISTS WHO 
FLY TIP ILLEGALLY DUMP COMMERCIAL 
WASTE OR THROW RUBBISH OUT OF THEIR 
WINDOWS C. H. A LITTER WARDEN PATROLS 
THE STREETS OF BELFAST OFFICERS 
LIKE THESE HAVE THE POWER TO ISSUE 
ON THE SPOT FINES OF UP TO EIGHTY TO 
THOSE THEY SEE DROPPING RUBBISH OR 
USING THE STREETS AS AN ASHTRAY 
MONEY RACES FROM FINES LA YEAR 
REACHED ONE POINT FIVE MILLION LESS THAN 
MOST COUNCILS MAKE FROM PARKING 
FINES AND SAY IT BLIGHT ON STREETS 
AN COUNTRYSIDES THAT SEEM TO BE 
GETTING WORSE THIS KIND OF EYESORE 
IS A PARTICULAR PROBLEM NOW 
COUNCILS ALSO WANT THE POWERING 
POWER TO FINE THE OWNERS OF CARS IF 
THEY OR THEIR PASSENGERS DUMP WASTE 
LIKE THIS OR THROW LITTER FROM 
THEIR VEHICLES 
YOU WOULD LUKE FOR 
SPECIFIC AREAS WHERE LITTER IS A 
PROBLEM AT SPECIFIC TIMES HOW 
DREADFUL IT IS WHEN PEOPLE THROW 
OUT OF THE CAR YOU KNOW FISH AND 
CHIP WRAPPER OORS PIZZA BOX RIGHT RIGHT NOW THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THERE 
IS A LOOPHOLE THE PERPETRATORS 
THROW THE RUBBISH FROM THEIR CARS 
BUT COUNCILS CAN'T ALWAYS ESTABLISH 
WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE NEXT WEEK 
WASTE MINISTER JOAN RUDDOCK WILL 
MEET WITH LOCAL COUNCILLORS TO 
DISCUSS WHAT CAN BE DONE TO TACKLE 
THE LITTER BUGS THE WORLD'S SEVEN 
RICHEST COUNTRIES HAVE GIVEN BANKS 
A ONE HUNDRED DAY DEADLINE TO REVEAL MUCH 
THE CREDIT CRUNCH HAS COST THEM A 
MEETING OF THE G. SEVEN CALLED FOR THE 
BANKS TO MAKE PUBLIC HOW MUCH MORE 
THEY COULD LOSE TO PROVE THEIR RISK 
PROCEDURES PROCEDURES THE BUCK STOPS WITH THEM FINANCE 
MINISTERS AND CENTRAL BANKERS FROM 
THE WORLD'S TOP SEVEN ECONOMIES 
THEY CAME TO WASHINGTON TO FIND A 
WAY TO STOP ANOTHER CREDIT CRUNCH 
BANK BOARDROOMS HAVE BEEN BUFFETED 
FROM MONTHS BY TURBULENCE IN THE 
WORLD'S FINANCIAL MARKETS THE 
MINISTERS HERE GAVE THEM ONE HUNDRED DAYS 
TO REVEAL JUST HOW MUCH THE CREDIT 
CRUNCH HAS COST THEM THEY ARE ALSO 
ASKING BANKS TO BE MORE OPEN ABOUT 
WHERE THEIR MONEY IS INVESTED THE 
CHANCELLOR SAYS MAKING BANKS MORE 
TRANSPARENT IS THE WAY TO CALM 
FINANCIAL WATERS 
IF ACTION CAN BE 
TAKEN AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL THEN 
WE SHOULD DO THAT BUT WHICH ALSO 
WANT TO ENCOURAGE BANKS TO DISCLOSE 
THE LOSSES THEY MAY HAVE SUSTAINED 
SO THEY CAN RESTORE CONFIDENCE AND AND IT IS CONFIDENCE WHICH MANY 
ECONOMISTS BELIEVE IS THE SILVER 
BULLET WHICH COULD STOP A RESEG IN 
ITS TRACKS IT IS CERTAINLY LACKING 
AT THE MOMENT YESTERDAY STOCK 
MARKETS DROPPED IN EUROPE AND THE 
U. S. BRITISH MORTGAGE LENDERS ARE 
FEELING JITTERY TOO THEY HAVE 
WORNED WARNED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THEY MIGHT 
ONLY LEND HALF WHAT THEY DID LAST 
YEAR IT IS NERVES LIKE THAT WHICH 
CAN SEND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE INTO 
FREE FALL IN AMERICA IT IS AS IT 
LOWEST LEVEL FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS THE G. SEVEN 
PLAN IS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT IT FROM 
A FUTURE CREDIT CRUNCH BUT THE 
DAMAGE FROM THE CURRENT ONE IS 
STILL BEING DONE MANY ECONOMISTS 
SAY AMERICA IS ALREADY IN A 
RECESSION MEANING THE BRITISH HIGH 
STREET COULD BE NEXT THE TUC IS 
URGING THE GOVERNMENT TO INTRODUCE 
MEASURES TO HELP MILLIONS OF LOW 
PAID WORKERS AFFECTED BY THE ON 
LITION OF THE TEN PENCE TAX RATE 
THE GENERAL SECRETARY BRE DAN 
BASHER HAD WARNED THE IMPACT OF THE 
NEW SYSTEM COMBINED WITH TAX BREAKS 
ENJOYED BY THE SUPERRICH IS CAUSING 
RESENTMENT AMONG ORDINARY WORKER T. 
THE UN ESTIMATES MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN DARFUR 
SINCE FIGHTING BROKE OUT FIVE YEARS 
AGO THIS WEEKEND A NEW CAMPAIGN IS 
BEING LAUNCHED TO HIGHLIGHT THE 
PROBLEMS BEING CAUSED BY THE 
CONFLICT AND TO CALL FOR MORE HELP 
FOR THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
CHILDREN LEFT WITHOUT PARENTS OR 
HOMES HOMES TWO WORLDS THAT COULDN'T BE 
FURTHER APART BUT THIS WEEKEND BIG 
NAME CELEBRITIES COME TOGETHER WITH 
AID AGENCIES TO CALL FOR ACTION IN 
DARFUR IN AN OPEN LETTER 
CHILDREN'S AUTHORS INCLUDING J. K. 
ROWLING AND JUDY BLUME WANT THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO DEMAND 
AN IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE FULL 
DEPLOYMENT OF THE PEACEKEEPING 
FORCE OTHER CELEBRITIES LIKE MATT 
DAMON THANDIE NEWTON JOELY 
RICHARDSON AND JEMIMA KHAN ARE 
FRONT AGO TELEVISION CAMPAIGN IN 
WHICH THEY SMASH TOYS TO SYMBOLISE 
CHILDHOOD UNDER ATTACK CHILDREN IN 
BRITAIN MIGHT DRAW PICTURES OF 
THEIR MUMIES AND DADDIES BUT KIDS 
IN DARFUR HAVE DRAWN THESE PICTURES 
OF VILLAGES ON FIRE PEOPLE BEING 
SHOT AND MUTILATED AND WOMEN BEING 
TIED UP THE UN ESTIMATES THAT 
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE DIED ALREADY IN 
THE CONFLUCT TWENTY FIVE MILLION ARE 
HOMELESS AND THE PEOPLE BEHIND 
THIS CAMPAIGN WANT THE WORLD TO DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
THE UNITED 
NATIONS JOINT PEACEKEEPING FORCE 
WITH THE AFRICAN UNION HAS GOT TO 
BE DEPLOYED IT HAS GOT TO BE GIVEN 
ENOUGH PETROL TO RUN THEIR VEHICLE 
ENOUGH WATER FOR THEIR SOLDIERS TO 
SURVIVE IT HAS TO BE DEPLOYED TO 
PROTECT THE CIVILIANS 
FIVE YEARS 
ON AND THE WAR IS STILL RAGING 
CAMPAIGNERS HOPE TOMORROW'S EVENTS 
WILL DRAW ATTENTION TO THE CHILDREN 
OF THE REGION WHO HAVE NEVER KNOWN 
PEACE PEACE AND WE WILL BE JOINED BY JASON I 
SACKS WHO YOU WILL KNOW FROM THE 
HARRY POTTER FILMS IN AN HOUR'S 
TIME TIME AND THAT IS A LOOK AT THE TOP 
STORIES NOW PUBS WHICH ONLY OFFER 
LARGE GLASSES OF WINE TO CUSTOMERS 
ARE ENCOURAGING IRRESPONSIBLE 
DRINKING THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF FI 
SIGS SAY EVEN THE SMALLEST GLASSES 
OF WINE AVAILABLE IN MANY PUBS 
WOULD PLACE DRIVERS OVER THE LEGAL 
LIMIT WE ARE JOINED BY A 
REPRESENTATIVE FROM ALCOHOL CONCERN 
WHAT ARE YOUR CONCERNS WE HAVE 
THREE GLASSES OF WINE HERE AND IT 
IS CLEAR THAT THIS ONE HAS GOT MORE 
THAN THE ONE AT THE FRONT SO 
OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE WOULD KNOW THAT 
RIGHT 
UNFORTUNATELY PEOPLE DON'T RIGHT KNOW WHAT SIZE A GLASS THEY ARE 
OFTEN GIVEN THE LARGEST SIZE AND 
THE CONCERN IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T 
HAVE A CHOICE IN TERMS OF THE GLASS 
THEY ARE ASKING FOR PUBS ARE 
INCREASING THE SIZE OF THE GLASSES 
INCREASING MEASURE THE STRENGTH OF 
ALCOHOL HAS GONE UP SO PEOPLE DON'T 
KNOW HOW MUCH THEY ARE DRINKING 
THEY WANT TO HAVE A SENSIBLE DRINK 
BUT THEY END UP HAVING MORE THAN 
THEY WANT TO AND THAT HAS CAUSED 
THE BINGE DRINKING EPIDEMIC THAT 
THE BRED MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS 
TALKED ABOUT 
ISN'T IT PATRONISING 
THAT SUGGESTING IT WOULD HAVE HUGE 
RESPONSE TO THIS WHENY SAYS NO 
ONE CAN MAKE YOU DO OR DRINK 
ANYTHING BUY A BOTTLE OF WINE OR 
DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE IT A 
COMMONSENSE APPROACH 
IN SOME PUB 
KWHROINS ASK FOR A GLASS YOU ARE 
GIVEN THE ONE SIZE AND THAT IS THE 
LARGEST SIZE THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE OR AS YOUR 
REPORT SHOWS THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SO THAT ISN'T 
A CHOICE AND REALLY THE INDUSTRY 
CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS THEY CAN'T 
PRETEND TO BE SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE 
AND PRACTICE METHODS SUCH AS THESE 
WHICH ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DRINK 
MORE THAN THEY WANTED TO WHAT WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE THIS IS ANOTHER 
TEXT I ASKED FOR A LARGE GLASS I 
DRINK IT SLOWER L. ENJOY IT MORE 
KNOWING I DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT MY 
WAY TO THE BAR AS OFTEN SOMEBODY 
WHO KNOWS THEY ARE GETTING A LARGER 
GLASS THEY KNOW HOW MUCH THEY ARE 
DRINKING AND THEY DON'T WANT TO GO 
TO THE BAR EVERY SO OFTEN ALL PART 
OF CUSTOMER SERVICE IN A PUB THAT THAT IS FINE BUT IN MANY CASES PEOPLE 
DON'T REALISE WHAT THEY ARE 
DRINKING IN THIS EXAMPLE THIS 
PERSON IS AWARE OF THAT BUT I 
THINK THE POINT IS PEOPLE SHOULD 
HAVE A CLEAR CHOICE THEY SHOULD BE 
TOLD THERE ARE DIFFERENT SIZES IN 
THIS PUB THERE IS A SMALLER SIZE 
AND A LARGER SIZE WHICH WOULD YOU 
LIKE AS BEING OPPOSED TO THIS IS 
THE SIZE AND IT COSTS THAT SO IT 
IS ABOUT CHOICE 
AT THE END OF THE 
DAY YOU DON'T MIND THE LARGER 
GLASSS OF WINE BEING OFFERED TO 
CUSTOMERS AS LOCK AS THEY GET AND 
THIS IS WHAT I AM HEARING AS LONG 
AS THEY GET A CHOICE OF THE SMALLER 
ONE ONE IN AN IDEAL WORLD WE WOULD HAVE 
SMALLER GLASSES THE STRENGTH OF 
ALCOHOL WOULD BE LESS BUT THE 
DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE PEOPLE ARE 
USED TO DRINKING STRONGER LEVELS OF 
BEER AND WINE AND THEY ARE USED 
TO DRINKING BIGGER SIZES BUT IN AN 
IDEAL WORLD WE WOULD DRINK MORE MOD 
P. RATLY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING IN 
ANY MORE OF YOUR COMMENTS LET US 
KNOW YOU ARE WATCHING BREAKFAST 
FROM B. B. C. NEWS SUPERSIZE DRINKS IN 
PUBS ARE PUSHING CUSTOMERS INTO 
UNSAFE LEVELS OF DRINKING ACCORDING

GORDON BROWN BARNED ROBERT MUGABE 
THAT THE WORLD IS RUNNING OUT OF 
PATIENCE WITH HIS REGIME HE SAID 
HE CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS TAKE 
SOMETHING LONG TO ANNOUNCE THE 
RESULT OF LAST MONTH'S PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION ELECTION AND STILL TO COME 
ON SCREEN DOCTORS BEN JAPAN JONES 
AND STEVE HEARTLY WILL TELL BUS THE 
PHYSICAL PAINS AND STRAINS THEY'LL 
FACE IN THE RUNNING THE LONDON

NOW LIAM HAS ALL THE WEATHER 
DETAILS FOR US 
NOW LIAM HAS ALL THE WEATHER DETAILS FOR US 
HI GOOD MORNING 
IT IS LOOKING FOR APRIL SHOWERS 
TODAY AND AGAIN THATCH SOME COULD 
BE HEAVY WITH HAIL AND THUNDER 
MIXED IN PARTICULARLY ACROSS 
SOUTHERN ENGLAND AND NORTHERN 
IRELAND THE SHOWERS FORMING SOUTH 
WESTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND GRADUALLY 
BECOMING HEAVIER AS WE HEAD TOWARDS 
THE MIDDLE PART OF THE DAY 
THE SKAERD SHOWERS ACROSS WALES 
MAINLY DRY ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND 
BUT THE SHOWERS WILL BUBBLE UP AND 
DEVELOP AS WE GO THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
NORTHERN HALF OF SCOTLAND MAINLY 
DRY BUT RAIN SLEET AND SNOW IN 
PLACES TO START THE DAY POSSIBLY 
A TEMPORARY COVERING OVER THE HILLS 
BUT THAT'S NOW CLEARING AND THE 
SNOW WILL MELT AWAY AS THE SUNSHINE 
STARTS TO COME OUT THROUGHOUT THE 
DAY THE HEAVIER SHOWERS ARE HAIL 
AND THUNDER ACROSS SOUTHERN PARTS 
OF ENGLAND POSSIBLY INTO NORTHERN 
IRELAND AS WELL COOL ACROSS THE 
EASTERN HALF OF SCOTLAND TODAY 
ONSHORE BREEZE BUT DROUBL FIGURES 
ELSEWHERE LONDON MARATHON SPELLS 
OF SHOWERS ACROSS MUCH OF THE DAY 
THANK YOU NOW HIGH ENERGY BILLS 
THERE YOU ARE AND RISING MORTGAGES 
ARE PROMPTING THOUSANDS OF US TO 
SHOP AROUND FOR A BETTER DEAL NOW 
FOR MANY THE QUICKEST AND EASIEST 
WAY OF DOING SO IS TO USE A PRICE 
COMPARISON WEBSITE BUT DO THEY 
REALLY OFFER THE BEST PRICES 
EXPERTS SAY THE ADVICE THEY GIVE 
CAN BE SKEWED BY FINANCIAL 
INCENTIVES AND THERE ARE CALLS FOR 
INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY TO OVERSEE 
OR TAKE OVER RUNNING THEM 
INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY TO OVERSEE 
THE 
MESSAGE FROM THE COMPARISON SITES 
IS SIMPLE THEY'LL SHOP AROUND FOR 
THE BEST DEALS SO WE DON'T HAVE TO 
THAT SAVES US TIME AND MORE 
IMPORTANTLY MONEY OFF OUR BILLS 
BUT THEY CAN ALSO MAKE MILLIONS FOR 
THE COMPANIES THAT RUN THEM 
ALTHOUGH THEY WON'T TELL US HOW 
MUCH ALMOST ALL OF THEM CHARGE 
BANKS AND UTILITIES EITHER EVERY 
TIME WE SWITCH OR EVERY TIME WE 
CLICK TO THEIR SITES 
NOW WILL ARE CALLS FOR BETTER 
REGULATION 
THERE ARE INCENTIVES REGULATION THERE WHICH WILL TEND TO SKEW THE 
INFORMATION THEY GIVE TO CONSUMERS 
AND FOR CONSUMERS TO BE CONFIDENT 
THAT THEY'RE GETTING ADVICE THAT'S 
RIGHT FOR THEM RATHER THAN THE 
ADVICE THAT'S RIGHT FOR THE 
COMPARISON WEBSITE IT IS GOOD TO 
HAVE AN END AUTHORITY WHO CAN MAKE 
SURE THAT THE INFORMATION IS 
IMPARTIAL OR EVEN RUN THE WEBSITE 
THEMSELVES 
SO DO THE SITES ALWAYS THEMSELVES OFFER THE BEST DEAL ADRIAN DOESN'T 
THINK SO HE'S BEEN LOOKING TO 
SWITCH HIS GAS AND ELECTRICITY 
SUPPLIER 
IF I LOOKED AT TWO OR SUPPLIER THREE COMPARISON WEBSITES THE SAME 
DETAILS THAT I TEN TER IN ONE WERE 
NOT GIVING ME THE SAME RESULTS AS 
TO WHAT THE BEST DEAL WAS ON NORWEB 
SIGHT AND THIS RAISED ALARM BELLS 
AS TO WHAT INFORMATION THE RESULTS 
ARE BASED ON 
A VOLUNTARY 
ACCREDITATION CODE WAS INTRODUCED 
SO PRICE COMPARISON SITES WOULD 
INCLUDE ALL GAS AND ELECTRICITY 
COMPANIES EVEN THOSE WHO DIDN'T 
PAY WHEN CONSUMERS SWITCHED BUT IT 
SEEMS SOME OF THE NEWEST ENERGY 
SUPPLIERS AREN'T ALWAYS LISTED AND 
THE CODE DOESN'T COVER THINGS LIKE 
CREDIT CARDS INSURANCE AND 
SAVINGS ACCOUNTS RESEARCH CARRIED 
OUT BY A FINANCIAL MAGAZINE 
REVEALED INTERESTING RESULTS IT 
SHOPPED AROUND FOR HOME INSURANCE 
A CREDIT CARD SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND 
TRAVEL INSURANCE USING SEVERAL 
DIFFERENT COMPARISON SITES IN 
EVERY CASE EACH COMPARISON SITE 
CAME UP WITH A DIFFERENT DEAL THAT 
IT SAID WAS THE BEST THEY'RE VERY 
MUCH BRANDED AS THE CONSUMER 
CHAMPION AND THEY'LL GET NINE BEST 
DEAL FOR US BUT THEY ARE COMMERCIAL 
ENTERPRISES AND THESE WEBSITES WILL 
HAVE COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH 
THE PROVIDERS AND THEY'RE IN THE 
BUSINESS OF MAKING MONEY SO WE'D 
LIKE THE WEB SITES TO BE UP FRONT 
ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY EARN FROM THE 
PROVIDERS THE COMPARISON SITES 
REJECT THE ACKNOWLEDGE SEDATIONS OF 
BIAS U. SWITCH SAYS WITHOUT THIS 
WEBSITE CONSUMERS WOULD BE WORSE 
OFF 
IF SOMEBODY COMES ALONG THE OFF SITE AND PUTS INFORMATION IN THEY 
WILL SAVE MONEY AND IN FACT THE 
SAVINGS CAN BE SIGNIFICANT THE THE FINANCIAL REGULATOR IS LOOKING AT 
THE WAY COMPARISON SITES RECOMMEND 
BEST INSURANCE BUYS BUT THERE'S NO 
SIGN OF WIDESPREAD REGULATION JUST 
YET IN THE MEANTIME THE ADVICE IS 
TO SHOP AROUND SEVERAL DIFFERENT 
COMPARISON SITES AND REALISE THE 
BEST DEAL MAY NOT BE AS GOOD AS IT 
LOOKS QUITE A LOT OF REACTION TO 
THAT INSTEAD WE WILL BE TALKING 
TO MONEY SUPERMARKET DOTCOM BUT A 
LOT OF US HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH AND 
IT GETS CONFUSING WHEN YOU HAVE TO 
SHOP AROUND FOR A SITE WHICH SHOPS 
AROUND FOR YOU THESE SITE ARE 
NOTHING ELSE FOR AFFILIATED 
CHANNELS AND PAYING THE MOST 
COMMISSION TO THEM L. L. WORK IN THE 
MARKETING INDUSTRY AND THIS IS 
COMMON KNOWLEDGE TO ALL THOSE WHO 
WORK IN IT SAYS IAN FROM DAVENTRY 
WE WILL BE TALKING MORE ABOUT THAT 
STORE YIFPLT WE'RE JOINED BY EVE 
POLLARD NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A 
QUICK FLICK THROUGH SOME OF THE 
FRONT PAGES 
A LOT OF STORIES ABOUT 
C. C. T. V. CAMERAS THIS PARTICULAR ONE 
TIMES IS ABOUT LITTER WE'VE BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT THIS THIS MORNING 
THE IDEA THAT C. C. T. V. CAMERAS WILL BE 
USED TO CATCH LITTER BUGS EVEN IF 
YOU'RE DRIVING ALONG AND DROPPED 
SOMETHING OUT OF YOUR CAR IF 
YOU'RE PICKED UP MAYBE YOU'LL BE 
FINED DAILY MAIL IT WAS HER TWENTY ONE 
YEAR OLD DAUGHTER'S WISH TO DONATE 
A KIDNEY BUT BECAUSE HER NOT 
FOLLOWING THE FORMAL PROGRESS THAT 
DIDN'T HAPPEN AND IT WENT TO A 
COMPLETE STRANGER SUN BRIEFLY 
MORE INTEREST IN SHANNON MATTHEWS 
ALLEGATIONS CONTINUE ABOUT HER AND 
FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY TELEGRAPH 
COUNCIL SPY CASES HIT A THOUSAND A 
MONTH MORE ON LOCAL COUNCILS 
PAYING BIG BROTHER DON'T KNOW HOW 
YOU FEEL LOOKING AT WHETHER PEOPLE 
ARE DOG FOULING DOUGH OWNERS ARE 
FOULING AND LITTERING WE STARTED ON 
THIS STORY IT SEEMS EXTRAORDINARY 
DEVELOPMENTS IN AMERICA IN 
CONNECTION WITH ALZHEIMER'S IN IN AMERICA THEY HAVE THEY SAY THEY 
FOUND A DRUG WHICH THEY'VE USED FOR 
RHEUMATOID ART RIOTOUS BUT IF YOU 
INJECT IT IN THE SPINE AND NECK T. 
GOES STRAIGHT TO THE BRAIN AND 
CHANGES ALZIEMER SUFFERERS IN 
MINUTES IT SAYS AND IT SHOWS A 
VIDEO OF A MAN WHO HADN'T 
RECOGNISED HIS WIFE FOR TEN YEARS 
AND AFTER RECEIVING THE TREATMENT 
HE DID OBVIOUSLY THIS IS VERY MUCH 
IN THE EARLY STAGES IN THE 
EXPERIMENTAL STAGES BUT IT WOULD 
BE FANTASTIC WE BELIEVE SCIENCE 
WILL DO WONDERFUL THINGS AND OF 
COURSE IT HAS WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT 
IF THIS WORKED 
THAT ACCOUNT OF 
THAT INSTANT CHANGE IS A THING THAT 
MAKES IT SO EXTRAORDINARY 
IT MAKES 
IT LIKE A SCIENCE FICTION THING 
THEY INJECT IT IN THE SPINE AND 
YOU WERE ALMOST TURNED UPSIDE DOWN 
SO THE DRUG GOES TO YOUR BRAIN IT 
IS A CERTAIN THING YOU HAVE IN YOUR 
BRAIN THAT AFFECTS YOU THAT GIVES 
YOU ALZHEIMER'S 
BUT PRESUMABLY THERE WILL BE 
SERIES OF TEST ASS TIME IT HAS TO 
GO THROUGH 
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE 
DRUG COMPANIES WILL BE ON TO THIS 
LIKE A FLASH THAT WOULD BE GOOD 
INDEPENDENT BAN KEY MOON WHO HAS 
DECIDED HE WON'T GO TO THE OPENING 
CEREMONY 
NIFS AMERICA AND DIDN'T CEREMONY HEAR MUCH ABOUT THE TORCH GOING 
THROUGH SAN FRANSISCO BECAUSE THEY 
TOOK IT THROUGH THE BACK STREETS 
INCREDIBLE ISN'T IT INCREDIBLE INCREDIBLE AND THE IDEA THE WORLD DIDN'T SEE 
THIS COMING THE CHINESE HAVE NOT 
CHANGED THEIR ATTITUDE TO HUMAN 
RIGHTS AT ALL AND MEANWHILE WHY 
SHOULD THEY BE COVERED IN OLYMPIC 
GLORY 
DOES THIS MAKE YOU FEEL LESS GLORY COMFORTABLE ABOUT THE OLYMPICS IN 
CHINA AT ALL 
COMPLETELY L. KNOW IT 
IS SPORT AND I FEEL SORRY FOR 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE JUST BEEN TRAINING 
FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS FOR THEIR 
CHANCE TO WIN AN OLYMPIC GOLD BUT 
I THINK YOU HAVE TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF 
THE COUNTRY THAT THE OLYMPICS ARE 
RUN IN FRANKLY CHINA ISN'T READY 
YET 
SUPPOSING THE COUNTER YET ARGUMENT IS HAD IT NOT BEEN IN 
CHINA THIS AMOUNT OF ATTENTION ON 
THE ISSUE IN SO MANY DIFFERENT 
COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD 
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED 
THAT'S A 
VALID POINT AND MAYBE MAYBE IT 
WILL MAKE THE CHINESE WAKE UP TO 
THIS BUT THE FACT IS THE CHINESE 
HAVE NOT PULLED BACK ATTACKS ON 
TIBET AND THEIR HUERLTS ISSUES IN 
THE COUNTRY HAVE NOT CHANGE HUMAN 
RIGHTS ISSUES IN THE COUNTRY HAVE 
NOT CHANGED ONE IOTA 
THE SPYING 
ISSUE 
I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THAT ISSUE APPARENTLY OVER TWELVE THOUSAND 
APPLICATIONS THROUGH STUDY 
COVERTLY IT IS CALLED DIRECTED 
SURVEILLANCE ON PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
TAKEN OUT ON PEOPLE IN THE LAST 
YEAR LAST WEEK WE WERE SHOCKED 
WHEN A COUPLE FROM DORSET WAS 
WATCHED WHETHER THEY'D SEND THEIR 
CHILDREN TO A CERTAIN SCHOOL NOW 
WE HAVE A BOROUGH COUNCIL IN 
HAMPSHIRE SAYS IT IS CURRENTLY 
USING THIS IS LEGISLATION BROUGHT 
IN TO WATCH OUT FOR TERRORISTS 
WHICH COUNCILS ARE ALLOWED TO USE 
INTO DOG FOULING NOW DOG FOULING 
IS DISGUSTING BUT THE FACT THAT 
YOUR COUNCIL CAN FIND YOUR 
TELEPHONE RECORDS WHO YOU SENT E. 
MAILS TOO AND WHICH WEBSITES YOU 
LOOK AT THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A 
POLICE STATE 
IF THEY WERE 
INVESTIGATING SOMEONE WHOSE DOG WAS 
DOG FOULING SOMEWHERE THEY 
WOULDN'T BE LOOKING AT THEIR PHONE 
RECORDS WOULD THEY 
THEY CAN OF 
COURSE IT WOULDN'T BE APPROPRIATE 
BUT IF YOU ASK FOR DIRECTED 
SURVEILLANCE THIS IS ONE OF THE 
THINGS YOU CAN SEE L. L. THINK THIS IS 
THE BEGINNING OF THE LACK OF 
PRIVACY AND THE FEELING YOU'RE 
WATCHED IN THIS COUNTRY IS GROWING 
I THINK ALL THE TIME 
THE OTHER 
STORY IS HEATHER MILLS IS BACK IN 
THE PAPERS AND SHE'S HAD ANOTHER 
GO AT PAUL MCCARTNEY 
SPEAKING FROM 
LAS VAGAS WHERE SHE IS JUDGING THE 
MISS U. S. CONTEST THIS WOMAN IS 
GOING TO BE GOING TO BE THE SORT 
OF BAND LEADER TALKING ABOUT PAUL 
MCCARTNEY L. THOUGHT THAT AFTER THE 
DIVORCE SHE WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO 
TALK ABOUT THE DIVORCE WE WERE 
GOING TO HEAR LESS FROM HER BUT 
THREE WEEKS LATER SHE'S HAVING A 
GO AT PAUL AND PAUL'S GIRLFRIEND 
SHE SAYS AND SHE'S HAVING A GO AT 
THE JUDGE THAT JUDGED HER DIVORCE 
CASE 
I'M INTRIGUED AS A FORMER CASE NEWSPAPER EDITOR WHERE DOT EDITORS 
THINK THE INTEREST IN THIS STORY IS 
ARE THEY SIDING WITH HER A BIT IS 
THAT BECAUSE THEY THINK PEOPLE 
ADMIRE HER A LITTLE BIT 
I THINK 
SHE'S A CAR ACCIDENT WAITING TO 
HAPPEN AND I'M AFRAID NEWSPAPERS 
ARE FASCINATED BY THAT AND OF 
COURSE LOOK THERE IS A CERTAIN 
THINGS ABOUT HER THAT PEOPLE ADMIRE 
SHE TOOK HER OWN COURT CASE SHE 
DIDN'T HAVE LAWYERS SHE'S NOISY 
BUT NEWSPAPERS ACTUALLY HAD A LOT 
OF STUFF ON THIS WOMAN BEFORE SHE 
MARRIED PAUL MCCARTNEY BECAUSE OF 
HIM THEY PUT IT ON THE BACK BURNER 
THEY ARE FASCINATED HOW SOMEBODY 
WHO IN A WAY GOT TO LUCKY MARRIED 
A BEATLES AND THEY'RE REVERED FROM 
THE DAY HE DIES THAT SHE COULD 
HAVE GOT IT SO WRONG 
AWAY FROM THE 
PUBLIC BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THIS 
SHE'S FIGHTING TO GET THE 
TRANSCRIPTS OF THE DIVORCE HEARING 
AS WELL 
YES AND SHE'S COMPLAINING 
ABOUT GETTING FOUR MILLION 
I CARE 
SAY WE WILL HEAR FROM HER AGAIN 
YES A LOT 
ON TO SOMETHING 
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THE MIRROR 
STORY ABOUT KIT YESTERDAY THERE 
WAS A RULING THAT SOLDIERS CAN SUE 
THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE IF THEY 
FEEL THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN 
PROVIDED WITH THE RIGHT KIT UNDER UNDER HUMAN RIGHTS THEY SAY YOU HAVE THE 
RIGHT EVEN IF YOU'RE IN HOSTILE 
TERRITORY TO HAVE THE BEST DEFENCE 
YOU HAVE AND SOME BEREAVED PARENTS 
ARE GOING TO ACT ON THIS MAYBE IT 
HAS BEEN SHOCKING TO US I THINK 
WHATEVER YOU THINK OF THE WAR THE 
FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING INTO WAR 
WITHOUT THE PROPER EQUIPMENT ONE 
MAN APPARENTLY DIED BECAUSE HE 
DIDN'T HAVE NIGHT GOGGLES L. THINK 
THIS IS A FAIR THING I THINK IT IS 
A RIGHT THING 
A LOT OF PEOPLE 
WOULD AGREE AND FAMILIES HUGE 
BATTLE THEY'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR 
SOMEONE TO SAY THIS OPENLY AND SAY 
THIS IS WRONG 
AND MORE THAN THIS 
IS WRONG THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO 
GET A FAIR HEARING IN A COURT OF 
LAW IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR YOU 
OR YOUR CHILD OR YOUR HUSBAND HAS 
BEEN SENT INTO BATTLE WITHOUT THE 
RIGHT EQUIPMENT 
IT WAS INTERESTING 
A FEW MILITARY PEOPLE FORMER 
MILITARY PEOPLE TOOK THE VIEW 
EVERYONE AGREES YOU SHOULD NOT GO 
INTO SITUATIONS WITHOUT THE CORRECT 
EQUIPMENT 
BUT THEY'RE HORRIFIED EQUIPMENT YOU CAN SUE THE GOVERNMENT AND AND SOMEHOW HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION 
HAS A PLACE IN A WAR ZONE THAT'S 
THE TRICKY AREA 
A WAR AREA NOW EVERY YEAR BECOMES 
MORE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS 
MORE EQUIPMENT NEWER EQUIPMENT 
SAFER EQUIPMENT L. THINK THERE IS A 
CASE WHERE A MAN DIED BECAUSE HE 
DIDN'T HAVE A RADIO THESE THINGS 
DIDN'T EXIST A FEW YEARS AGO A 
LITTLE RADIO YOU COULD TAKE WITH 
YOU SO YOU COULD SPEAK TO YOU KNOW 
SOY THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 
IS GOING TO GET BIGGER AND MORE 
PROBLEMATIC BUT I THINK IF YOU ARE 
GOING TO SEND PEOPLE INTO WAR YOU 
HAVE TO GIVE THEM THE VERY BEST 
EQUIPMENT YOU CAN 
THANK YOU FOR

FIVE STRIDES FOR EVERY ONE OF YOURS 
C. H. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO MISS 
MICHELLE OR INDEED BUSTER MICHELLE 
THIS IT WILL TAKE NINE AND A HALF 
HOURS ABOUT BUSTER HE DID A HALF 
MARATHON IN FOUR AND A HALF HOURS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH CAMPAIGNERS 
ARE CLAIMING THAT CHILDREN'S 
TELEVISION PROGRAMMES IN BRITAIN IS 
BEING DOMINATED BY AMERICAN IMPORTS 
THAT PRODUCERS ALLIANCE FOR CINEMA 
AND TELEVISION SAYS ONLY ONE PER CENT OF NEW 
PROGRAMMES ARE BEING MADE IN THE U. K. 
SO THEY HAVE LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN 
CALLING FOR MORE INVESTMENT IN KIDS 
T. V. AND HIGHLIGHT THE PROBLEM THEY 
HAVE GIVEN THE WOMBLES AND AMERICAN 
MAKE OVER THEY SAY FUTURE OF 
BRITISH TELEVISION COULD LOOK LIKE 
THIS AWESOME 
AWESOME HOOTERS 
HERE HE IS BUDDY 
CALL NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN N. Y. P. D. 
NO PANTS N. Y. P. D. YOU'RE ON 
WHO CALLED THE SHERIFF 
SUN SIDE UP WITH FRYS AND GIVE ME 
A SODA SUPERSIZE 
OH MY GOSH GET GET OUT OF HERE 
WAY TO GO 
GIVE ME BREAK WHATEVER 
NO WAY IT BREAK WHATEVER IT CERTAINLY MAKES A POINT WHEN YOU 
WATCH IT IT IS SOBERING THEY ARE 
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S GONE TO EXTREMES 
IT IS A BIT OF FUN 
BUT THE 
STATISTICS ARE REALLY ALARMING IF 
YOU BELIEVE IN BRITISH CHILDREN'S 
TELEVISION 
YOU KNOW THOSE ARE NOT TELEVISION PACKED STATISTICS THEY'RE OFCOM'S 
STATISTICS IN THE REPORT THEY 
ISSUED LAST YEAR THERE'S ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN THOUSAND 
HOURS OF TELEVISION FOR CHILDREN 
AND THAT'S WHY PARENTS AND KIDS 
THINK THERE'S MUCH OF T. V. THE 
REALITY IS MUCH IS REPEATS AND SEVENTEEN PER CENT 
OF THE WHOLE STUFF IS MADE IN THE 
U. K. NEW PROGRAMMES ONE PER CENT ONLY BUT BUT THIS IS FOLLOWING THE TREND THOUGH 
ISN'T IT SOME WOULD ARGUE OTHER 
PROGRAMMES WE'RE GETTING WE'RE 
GETTING A LOT OF STUFF FROM AMERICA 
ADULT DRAMAS IN FILMS AND SO FORTH 
SO ISN'T THIS JUST FOLLOWING THE 
SAME SORT OF TREND WHAT DIFFERENCE 
DOES IT MAKE 
NO IT ISN'T FOLLOWING 
THE SAME TREND PERCENTAGES ARE 
DIFFERENT IN THE ADULT WORLD L. PUT 
TO YOU IF WE WERE TOLD THAT THEY 
WERE GOING TO BE NO MORE DRAMAS ON 
I. T. V. BECAUSE THERE'S PLENTY OF GREAT 
SHOWS THEY CAN BUY FROM THE STATES 
THERE WOULD BE AN OUTCRY BECAUSE 
IT IS KIDS I. T. V. IS ALLOW TODAY CUT 
BACK THE CHILDREN'S OUTPUT TO TWO 
HOURS A WEEK FROM WHAT USED TO BE 
TWO HOURS A DAY ONLY A YEAR AGO IS IS YOUR MAIN ISSUE WITH THIS IF YOU 
LIKE PROGRAMME MAKERS OVER HERE 
ARE NOT GETTING THE CHANCE TO MAKE 
TELEVISION IF THE QUALITY OF THE 
THING IS BROUGHT IN WAS HIGH 
ENOUGH WOULD YOU HAVE A PROBLEM 
WITH IT 
THE QUALITY IS HIGH THAT'S 
WHERE WE I REPRESENT SAFE KIDS T. V. 
UMBRELLA TELEVISION WE WORK 
TOGETHER IN THE CAMPAIGN THERE'S 
FIFTEEN OF US WE SLIGHTLY TAKE ISSUE 
WITH THE PACK POSITION BECAUSE 
SAFE T. V. SAYS AMERICAN PROGRAMMES 
ARE BAD BUT WE NEED A RICH MIX 
PROGRAMMES FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
YOU DON'T WANT THEM ALL OF THE 
WORLD AND NOT FROM YOUR OWN KUFPBLT 
WHAT DIFFERENCE THOUGH THIS IS 
SLIGHTLY CONFUSING FOR ME WHAT 
DIFFERENCE 
IT MAKE IF YOU 
DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF YOU HAVE TEN YEAR OLD WATCH AGO 
AMERICAN TELEVISION VERSUS 
BRITISH MADE TELEVISION IS IT 
AFFECTING HOW THEY'RE GROWING UP 
IT IS ABOUT EMPOWERMENT AGAIN IF 
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROGRAMMES 
BASED IN YOUR OWN CULTURE IF YOU 
DIDN'T HAVE PANORAMA OR SKINS OR 
THE HUGE VARIETY OF PROGRAMMES THAT 
ADULTS EXPECT THAT SPEAK TO YOUR 
CULTURE AND TALK ABOUT THE THINGS 
YOU SEE AND EXPERIENCE EVERY DAY 
HERE IN THE U. K. YOU WOULD BE 
EXTREMELY UPSET ABOUT IT WHEN 
THAT'S DONE TO KIDS WE DON'T 
CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES IN FIVE 
YEARS' TIME WE WILL HAVE KIDS WHO 
HAVE VERY LITTLE REFERENCE TO THEIR 
OWN LIVES IN THE MEDIA THEY WATCH 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING AND 
TALKING TO US IF YOU HAVE VIEWS 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE KIDS OR KIDS 
WATCHING T. V. MAYBE YOU'RE WATCHING 
ABOUT IT YOURSELF WE WILL HAVE 
JANE BENNETT AFTER NINE HUNDRED SO WE CAN 
PUT YOUR QUESTIONS DIRECTLY TO HER 
ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM 
WHAT YOU SEE AT CHILDREN'S 
TELEVISION THIS IS BREAKFAST NEWS 
SUPERSIZE DRINKS IN PUBS ARE 
PUSHING CUSTOMERS INTO UNSAFE 
LEVELS OF DRINKING THAT'S 
ACCORDING TO THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF 
PHYSICIANS GORDON BROWN WARNED 
ROBERT MUGABE THAT THE WORLD IS 
RUNNING OUT OF PATIENCE WITH HIS 
REGIME HE SAID HE CAN'T 
UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS TAKING SO LONG 
TO ANNOUNCE THE RESULT OF LAST 
MONTH'S PRESIDENTIAL ECTION AND 
STILL TO COME IN THIS HALF HOUR 
POOH ALWAYS LIKED A LITTLE 
SOMETHING AT ELEVEN HUNDRED IN THE MORNING 
MUM'S THE WORD WHEN IT COMES TO 
BEDTIME READING WE WILL LOOK AT 
WHY DADS WITH TOLD TO PICK UP A 
BOOK AND TURN OVER A NEW LEAF STAY 
WITH US 
LET'S CHECK OUT WHAT THE WEATHER 
HAS IN STORE FOR YOU 
LET'S CHECK OUT WHAT THE WEATHER HAS IN STORE FOR YOU 
HI GOOD MORNING IT IS APRIL AND 
THE WEATHER IS BEHAVING HOW IT 
SHOULD BE A MIXTURE OF SUNNY SPELLS 
AND SHOWERS AGAIN TODAY ONCE MORE 
SOME SHOWERS COULD BE HEAVY AND 
THUNDERY POSSIBLY WITH HAIL MIXED 
IN TOO LET'S HAVE A LOOK FOR ONE THOUSAND 
THE SHOWERS ARE DEVELOPING ACROSS 
THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND DEVON 
CORNWALL AND DORSET GRADUALLY 
BECOMING HEAVIER IN THE EARLY PART 
OF THE AFTERNOON ACROSS WALES 
SUNNY SPELLS AND SHOWERS CHILLY 
START IN NORTHERN IRELAND BUT 
SHOWERS WILL DEVELOP TOWARDS THE 
MIDDLE PART OF THE DAY ACROSS THE 
NORTH OF SCOTLAND DRY MORNING BUT 
TOWARDS THE SOUTH A DIFFERENT STORY 
CLOUDY AND GREY SKIES RAIN SLEET 
AND SNOW PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE 
HILLS MAYBE A TEMPORARY COVERING 
IN PLACES FOR TIME THE SUN WILL 
COME OUT AND GET RID OF ANY SNOW 
HERE MIDLANDS EAST ANGLIA AND 
SOUTH EAST DRY BUT QUICKLY THE 
SUN WILL GET TO WORK BUBBLING UP 
THE CLOUD THE REST OF THE DAY THE 
SOUTH OF SCOTLAND WILL SEE THE LAST 
OF THE RAIN SLEET AND SNOW 
BREAKING UP AND PUSHING SOUTHWARDS 
INTO NORTHERN ENGLAND ELSEWHERE 
HEFTY SHOWERS ACROSS SOUTH OF 
ENGLAND AND WEST OF IRELAND COOL 
ACROSS THE EAST OF SCOTLAND A 
BREEZE SO SEVEN THE TOP TEMPERATURE 
GENERALLY WE'LL GET INTO DOUBLE 
FIGURES OVERNIGHT'S TONIGHT MOST 
SHOWERS WILL DIE AWAY ACROSS 
ENGLAND AND WALES CLUSTER OF 
SHOWERS COMING IN ACROSS WALES IN 
THE MIDDLE PART OF THE NIGHT BUT 
DRY CLEAR AND STARY SKIES AND 
THAT WILL ALLOW THE TEMPERATURES TO 
DIP AWAY AS TEMPERATURES DROP TO 
ONE TO TWO DEGREES CHILLI START TO SUNDAY 
MORNING BUT MOST PLACES STARTING 
DRY QUICKLY THE CLOUDS WILL 
BUBBLE UP SHOWERS WILL BREAK OUT 
PARTICULARLY ACROSS ENGLAND AND 
WALES HAIL AND THUNDER IS POSSIBLE 
IN THOSE SHOWERS SHOWERS AFFECTING 
SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND AND 
TOP TEMPERATURE FROM EIGHT TO FOURTEEN DEGREES 
LONDON MARATHON TOMORROW IF YOU'RE 
UP EARLY IT MAY BE DRY BUT 
SHOWERS WILL START TO DEVELOP AND 
SHOWERS BECOMING HEAVIER AND 
PERSISTENT IN THE EARLY PART OF THE 
AFTERNOON AS FOR MONDAY WELL 
SIMILAR DAY DRY BRIGHT MORNING 
AND SPELLS OF SUNSHINE ACROSS 
ENGLAND AND WALES SHOWERS WILL 
BREAK OUT IN THE MIDDLE PART OF THE 
DAY MAYBE MORE IN THE WAY OF 
PERSISTENT RAIN WHICH IN WESTERN 
SCOTLAND IN THE LATER PART OF THE 
AFTERNOON 
NOW THERE WAS LITTLE SURPRISE WHEN 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND CUT INTEREST 
RATES BY A QUARTER PER CENT THIS 
WEEK MUCH MORE SURPRISING WAS THAT 
IT HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON MORTGAGES 
THE BANKS AND BUILDING SOCIETIES 
DIDN'T CUT THEIR LENDING RATES AND 
SOME PUT THEM UP THEY KEPT THE 
RATES PAID UP ON SAVINGS TO 
EXPLAIN PAUL LEWIS FROM MONEY BOX 
IS HERE 
BANK OF ENGLAND BRINGS DOWN THE 
RATES MORTGAGES GO UP THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED FOR SOME OF 
THEM THREE LENDERS PUT UP THEIR 
FIXED RATES TO ALMOST AT THE SAME 
TIME THE BANK WAS CUTTING RATES IT 
IS VERY STRANGE ALTHOUGH THEY'VE 
HAD TO CUT TRACKER RATES THOSE ARE 
THE ONES THAT FOLLOW THE RATE AND 
THE STANDARD VARIABLE RATE HAS GONE 
DOWN IN SOME CASES THE BEST DEALS 
THE DEALS WE ALL GO FOR WHEN WE 
BUY A PLACE THEY'VE TENDED TO BE 
DRIFTING UPWARDS AND THAT'S 
COMPLETELY THE OPPOSITE TO WHAT YOU 
EXPECT 
THE THING IS THAT THE BANK EXPECT OF ENGLAND DOESN'T REALLY CONTROL 
WHAT GOES ON THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS 
NOT ANY MORE WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO 
HAPPEN IS THEY CUT THE COST OF 
BORROWING THAT MEANS GREAT I'LL 
BOOST THE ECONOMY AND SPEND MONEY 
BUT MORTGAGES AREN'T CHANGED FOR 
MANY PEOPLE SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO 
GO OUT SO THEY'RE NOT CONTROLLING 
THE ECONOMY WHAT IS CONTROLLING IT 
IS THE BANKS HAVE STOPPED TRUSTING 
EACH OTHER SO THEY'RE NOT LENDING 
EACH OTHER MONEY THERE'S LESS 
MONEY ABOUT SO WHEN YOU AND I WANT 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND MORTGAGE THEY HAVE 
TO SKURY AROUND TRYING TO FIND THE 
MONEY IF OTHER BANKS LEND IT TO 
THEM THEY CHARGE A HIGHER RATE 
THE RATE WENT UP THIS WEEK EVEN 
THOUGH THE BANK OF ENGLAND CUT THE 
BANK RATE 
THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
CAN'T CONTROL IT THAT WAY WHAT 
SNELS 
WELL WHAT THE LENDERS SAY IS SNELS THEY SHOULD BE PUTTING MONEY INTO 
THE ECONOMY THE BANK OF ENGLAND 
SHOULD BE LENDING THE MONEY AT A 
GOOD RATE SO THEY CAN LEND IT TO 
US THE BANK OF ENGLAND ONLY HAS 
OUR MONEY SO IN A SENSE IT IS 
RECYCLING IT THERE'S A STRONG 
FEELING WHY SHOULD WE BE BAILING 
OUT THE BANKS FOR THEIR MISTAKES 
IF YOU GOT MONEY YOU'RE IN CLOVER 
BECAUSE SAVINGS THE BEST RATES 
HAVE NOT COME DOWN YOU ARE GET 
SIX POINT FIVE PER CENT ON YOUR SAVINGS 
I WANT TO TIE 
THIS IN WITH A STORY ABOUT THE 
WEBSITES YOU GO TO WHICH CHECK 
THINGS FOR YOU THERE ARE WEBSITES 
THAT DO IT FOR MORTGAGES AND AND SAVINGS 
BUT DO 
THEY WORK ARE SAVINGS THEY HELP SNFL SOME ARE SAYING THEY 
CONFUSE THINGS 
WELL THEY DO WORK 
IF YOU'RE CAREFUL THE IMPORTANT 
THING IS NOT TO TRUST ONE OF THEM 
GO TO SELF SOME OF THEM MAYBE 
THE WAY THEY ARRANGE THINGS THEY 
PUT DEALS AT THE TOP NOT BECAUSE 
THEY'RE THE BEST BUYS BUT BECAUSE 
THEY'RE PAID TO PUT THEM AT THE TOP 
THEY HAVE TO SHOW THAT BUT WHEN 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE SCREEN YOU 
DON'T NOTICE GO TO SEVERAL LOOK 
AT GENUINE BEST BUYS AND TALK TO 
THE COMPANY BEFORE YOU TAKE THE 
DEAL AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING 
WHAT YOU EXPECT 
MONEYBOX IS ON 
RADIO FOUR MIDDAY AS 
EVER 
THANK YOU NOW FOR BOTH EVER PARENTS AND CHILDREN BEDTIME 
READING IS A SPECIAL EXPERIENCE 
BUT NOW DADS ARE BROUGHT TO BOOK 
BECAUSE THEY'RE FAR LESS LIKELY 
THAN MUMS TO TAKE PART IN THE 
NIGHTLY RITUAL YES MORE THAN A 
HALF OF FATHERS SAY WORK PRESSURES 
AND STRESS ARE THE MAIN REASONS 
BUT ORGANISERS OF THE NATIONAL YEAR 
OF READING SAY THIS ISN'T GOOD 
ENOUGH THEY FILM SOME DADS IN 
BASRA READING STORIES TO THEIR 
CHILDREN HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAIFPLT 
IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON LITTLE 
LEG LAY ON THE LEAF 
ONE SUNDAY MORNING THE WARM SUN 
CAME UP AND POP OUT OF THE EGG 
CAME TINY AND VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR 
WE'RE GOING ON A BEAR CATERPILLAR HUNT WE'RE GOING TO CATCH A BIG 
ONE WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY WE'RE 
NOT SCARED OH GRASS LONG WAVEY 
GRASS WE CAN'T GO OVER IT WE 
CAN'T GO UNDER IT OH NO WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO WILL YOU IT 
SKWISH SQUASH SKWISH SQUASH WE'RE 
GOING TO A BEAR HUNT WE'RE GOING 
TO CATCH A BIG ONE WHAT A 
BEAUTIFUL DAY WE'RE NOT SCARED ON ON SATURDAY HE ATE THROUGH ONE PIECE 
OF CHOCOLATE CAKE ONE ICE CREAM 
CONE ONE PICKLE ONE SLICE OF 
SWISS CHEESE ONE SLICE OF SALAMI 
ONE LOLLIPOP ONE PIECE OF CHERRY 
PIE ONE SAUSAGE ONE CUP CAKE AND 
ONE SLICE OF WATER MELEN THAT 
NIGHT HE HAD A STOMACH ACHE THERE THERE THEY ARE READING OUT STORIES TO 
THEIR KIDS FROM BASRA HONOR WILSON 
FLETCHER IS HERE AND DAMION QUEVA 
ARE MAGAZINE EDITOR AND MORE 
PARENTLY A FATHER OF TWO AND YOU 
BROUGHT ISABEL YOU'VE COME IN 
TODAY DO YOU LIKE IT WHEN DADDY 
READS FOR YOU YES 
IS HE ANY GOOD YES AT READING YES 
WHY IS IT SO YES IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK THERE THERE AREN'T NO NEGATIVES TO READING TO 
YOUR CHILDREN YOU WANT THEM TO 
READ EARLY AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO 
THEM IN LATER LIEFPLT NUMBER TWO 
IT IS A BONDING EXPERIENCE AND 
NUMBER THREE ULTIMATELY IT IS A 
GREAT WAY OF SETTLING THEM DOWN 
BEFORE THEY GO TO SLEEP AND 
DEVELOPING THEIR IMAGINATION YOU 
TEND TO WALK AWAY AND MAYBE A FOOT 
TALLER KNOWING YOU HAVE DONE YOUR 
JOB AS A DAD 
YOU ARE A BUSY GUY 
WHAT ABOUT THE TIME THING PEOPLE 
USE THAT REASON THEY SAY THEY'RE 
NOT HOME IN TIME WHAT ABOUT THAT 
IT IS IT IS A SELFISH ATTITUDE 
THERE IS NO EXCUSE NO REASON WHY 
YOU CAN'T DEDICATE FIVE OR TEN 
MINUTES IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG 
THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT BOOKS 
THERE'S ONES WITH NOISE ASS SOUNDS 
POP UP BOOKS THAT MAKE IT VERY 
INTERESTING THE STORIES FOR 
CHILDREN ESPECIALLY YOUNG CHILDREN 
AREN'T LONG NOT THAT IT IS A TIME 
ISSUE BUT THE TIME IT TAKES TO 
SETTLE YOUR CHILD DOWN TO STOP THEM 
BEING SO OVERACTIVE AFTER WATCHING 
TELEVISION OR HAVING A MEAL ET 
CETERA IS A GOOD PAYOFF BECAUSE IT 
WILL SETTLE THEM 
THIS PICKS UP ON 
DADS IN PARTICULAR AND HOW IT IS 
IMPORTANT BUT SOME MAY THINK READ 
AGO BEDTIME STORY IS READING 
WHETHER IT IS MUM OR DAD THAT DOES 
THAT 
IT IS A GOOD QUESTION I THAT THINK THE REASON WE'RE PARTICULARLY 
TARGETING DADS IS A SMALLER NUMBER 
OF THEM THAN MUMS ARE CURRENTLY 
READING TO THEIR KIDS THERE'S 
RESEARCH TO SHOW IF DADS GET 
DIRECTLY INVOLVED ESPECIALLY WITH 
BOYS IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE TO 
HOW WELL BOYS DO NOT IN A 
EDUCATIONAL SENSE BOYS THEND TO 
TALK ABOUT ENJOYING READING IF THEY 
TALK TO THEIR DAD AND ALSO WHAT 
THEIR DAD ENJOYS READING 
THIS IS 
ASSUMING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A TWO 
REGULAR FAMILY THERE MAY BE PEOPLE 
HERE WATCHING THIS AND IT MEANS 
THEIR FATHER IS NOT GOING TO BE 
AROUND DOES THAT MEAN THE CHILDREN 
IS DISADVANTAGED 
MUMS ARE DOING 
BRILLIANTLY ALREADY THIS IS 
ADDITIONAL BENEFIT THAT PAIL CARERS 
OR GUARDIANS CAN MAKE TO THE FUTURE 
SUCCESS OF THEIR CHILDREN CHILDREN 
WHO GET READ TO GET AHEAD THEY 
ENJOY READING AND HAVE A RICHER 
LIFE MORE TO THE POINT THE PEOPLE 
WHO DO THE READING GET PLEASURE OUT 
OF IT AS WELL THIS IS NOT LIKE 
DOING THE WASHING UP YOU FEEL 
FANTASTIC TO READING TO AND BEING 
READ TO

FAVOURITE BOOKS IN THERE WHAT'S 
YOUR FAVOURITE BOOK SINDRELA IS SINDRELA IS THAT A PICTURE BOOK WITH BIG

TURN THE PAGES AND LIKES TO READ 
CERTAIN SECTIONS OF IT L. DON'T

IN FACT 
YOU 
COULD GET 
GREAT IN FACT YOU COULD GET SOMETIMES UP

ARE GOING ON HOLIDAY TO EUROPE THIS 
YEAR WE NEED TO PRACTICAL Y. EXPLAIN YEAR THIS 
THESE ARE 
NOT MY EARN N. G.S THIS

IT IS 
TO SHOP AROUND 
ZERO THAT 
COULD BUY 
YOU ANYTHING FROM ONE 
EUROS IF YOU GO TO A SPECIAL EXCHANGE BUREAU AND 
PREPARED TO 
SPEND 
A LITTLE 
MORE CHANGE MORE AT

NEXT FIVE YEARS IN TERMS OF

TELEVISION AND SAFE WEB CONTENT FOR 
ALSO LOOK 
N. G. TO 
IN 
REASE SOME 
OF THE 
ORIGINAL PRODUCTION AGAIN 
MADE IN 
BRITAIN PARTICULAR Y. ON CBEEBIES 
WHERE WE KNOW 
THERE IS 
A THIRST FOR 
MORE ORIGINAL OUT UT ALTHOUGH IS THE 
MARKET IN 
TERMS OF 
THE COMMERCIAL BROADCAST RS WITH PRESSURES 
THEY ARE 
UNDER WHICH 
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED 
BY 
OFCOM IN THEIR REPORT 
HAVING CUT 
BACK EVEN THE DEBATE HELPED I. T. V. IN 
TERMS OF GOING 
FORWARD IN 
NEW 
INVESTMENT IN CHILDREN 
S. AND 
FOUR 
INVESTMENT 
THERE IS 
A PROBLEM 
IN THE 
SECTOR 
AS A 
WHOLE 
THE B. B. C. IS THE LINCHPIN 
CORE 
OF INVESTMENT WE SEE THAT AS BEING ABSOLUTE Y. ROCK SOLID 
THAT IS 
ABSOLUTELY ROCK SOLID THAT IS IMPORTANT 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THE OFCOM RULING 
THEY WOULD 
LIKE YOU TO SAY HERE YOU GO HERE 
AND 
GIVE IT 
TO THE 
COMMERCIAL BROADCAST RS WILL THAT HAPPEN THEY LOOK 
A 
RANGE OF 
HAPPEN OPTION 
AND 
LOOK 
D. AT 
MORE THAN THE 
TOP SLIGHT 
N. G. IDEA 
THAT YOU MENTION 
MENTIONED THEY DIFFERENT 
WAYS OF ASSISTING SECTOR AS A WHOLE MY 
VIEW IS 
THAT THE 
IDEA OF 
TAKE 
ONE SLICE OF MONEY WHICH WOULDN'T 
STRENGTH N. THE B. B. C.'S PROVISION 
OF 
ALL THE OUT UT TO DIFFERENT AUDIENCE AUDIENCES 
SHORE UP 
ANOTHER PART 
OF THE 
INDUSTRY 
THE ONLY 
PUTTING ON 
THE TABLE ALSO 
ONE THAT 
DOESN'T CONVINCE ME 
WHETHER WE WILL 
BE 
ABE TO 
BE THE STRONG 
WHICH THEY ACKNOWLEDGE B. B. C. 
SHOULD BE 
BE 
IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO LOOK 
IMAGINATIVE Y. AT DIFFERENT 
WAYS OF 
ASSIST N. G. INDUSTRY ALSO THE OTHER 
THAT IT 
ISN'T ALL 
THE EXIST 
IDEA IS THAT IT ISN'T ALL THE EXISTING PUBLIC 
SERVICE BROADCAST 
RS 
PART 
OF THIS 
THERE ARE DOZEN 
OF 
PART OF THIS THERE ARE DOZENS OF CHILDREN 
S. CHANNELS IN 
THIS COUNTRY 
THERE FOR CHILDREN YES 
THE BULK OF THEIR PROGRAMMING IS IM IMPORTED FROM ELSEWHERE 
LOOKING AT 
IMPORTED FROM ELSEWHERE LOOKING AT WHETHER WE CAN 
INCENTIVISE THOSE 
OTHER STRONG BRANDS FOR CHILDREN 
HAVE MORE ORIGINAL PRODUCTION WOULD 
ALSO MAKE 
SENSE TO A 
LOT OF 
CHILDREN 
CHILDREN CHILDREN ARE IN DIGITAL 
AND DIGITAL HOUSE 
HOLDS WITH 
THEIR 
OWN CHANNEL 
INCLUDING CBEEBIES 
THE TOP CHANNEL BUT THE OTHER CHANNEL 
COULD 
FULFIL A ROLE

N. G. BEYOND 
THE OLD
