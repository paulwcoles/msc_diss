I THINK OPUS TEN NUMBER SIX THAT'S PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME 
WHEN I STARTED THINKING TO MYSELF HANG ON A SEC THIS IS ONLY OPUS TEN 
CHOPIN WENT RIGHT UP TO I THINK OPUS SEVENTY WHICH WAS PUBLISHED WHILST HE WAS STILL ALIVE 
SO THIS IS VERY EARLY FOR HIM 
IT'S LIKE WRITING A NOVEL HE'S COMING OUT WITH VERY DEEP EMOTIONS 
VERY MATURE EMOTIONS EVEN THOUGH HE WAS A VERY YOUNG PERSON 
THAT'S VERY SURPRISING TO COME ACROSS THEM AND THAT AGAIN PRESENTS 
I GUESS MORE PROBLEMS FOR YOUNGER ARTISTS LIKE MYSELF 
BECAUSE YOU FEEL YOU DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES OF THOSE EMOTIONS TO EXPRESS YOURSELF WITH 
I THINK A LOT OF THE EMOTION IS JUST PAIN ANGUISH 
AND THE WAY HE'S WRITTEN IT 
IT REALLY ALLOWS YOU TO ALMOST FEEL THAT IN YOUR HANDS 
BECAUSE YOU'RE HOLDING ONTO NOTES 
AND THERE ARE THESE STRANGE HARMONIES WHICH CHOPIN'S WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY 
THAT YOU'VE GOT TO GET YOUR HAND INTO A STRANGE POSITION IN ORDER TO PLAY THEM 
AND BECAUSE IT'S SLOW YOU REALLY HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT 
AND TIME TO EXPRESS YOURSELF 
POIGNANT PIANO
