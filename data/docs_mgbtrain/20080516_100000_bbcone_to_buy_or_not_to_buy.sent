EDWARD THIS IS A PROPERTY SHOW NOT A HISTORY PROGRAMME WHAT ABOUT THE HOUSE 
I WAS COMING TO THAT IT'S MODERN MODERN I SAY A THREE STOREY TOWN HOUSE 
LIKE YOURS BUT BRAND SPANKING SPIFFINGLY NEW AND NO MOTORBIKE RACING OR ROCK MONSTERS

WHEN THEY WALK IN THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT O. K. 
OOH NEW OH LOVELY WHAT DO YOU THINK

IT'S WARM 
THEY LOVE IT AH 
LIKE ANGELS SINGING 
O. K. DO YOU NOT FEEL LIKE YOU WALK IN AND LOOK AT A DOOR 
THERE IS THAT BUT I'M SURE THAT IS PROBABLY THE DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM 
O. K. CRITICISM STRAIGHT OFF 
OPEN THE FRONT DOOR YOU'RE GREETED BY ANOTHER DOOR FUNCTIONAL DOOR GO THROUGH THAT DOOR TOILET 
YES 
GET YOUR WALLET OUT AND IT MAKES EXACTLY THE SAME NOISE 
I TAKE IT THIS IS THE LIVING ROOM IT IS NOT AS BIG AS I WAS HOPING 
YOU HAD A FOCAL POINT IN THE OTHER ONE 
YOU WALKED IN AND THEN THERE WAS THAT FIREPLACE NOT AS MANY THINGS IN IT CHARACTER 
WHERE WOULD YOU PUT THE TELLY IN THE LIVING ROOM WHEREABOUTS IN THE LIVING ROOM 
CORNER PROBABLY AND THE SOFA NEAR TO THE TELLY 
WHERE DO YOU PUT YOUR TELLY 
I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO NOT HAVE A TELLY THEN WE WILL HAVE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER INSTEAD 
LET'S THINK OF THE HOUSE AS A JOURNEY 
IN THEY WALK GO TO THE TOILET THEN THEY SIT DOWN IN THE LOUNGE 
NO T. V. NOW THEY'RE TALKING LIVING THEIR LIVES IN A MODERN WAY 
KITCHEN DINER THAT'S NICE 
THERE THEY ARE THEY'RE IN THE KITCHEN DINER 
ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP BEING WEIRD NO 
I'M A BIT SPEECHLESS ABOUT THIS HOUSE THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S A NEW HOUSE 
NO IT'S NOT IT IS IT'S BECAUSE IT'S A NEW HOUSE NO 
THIS HOUSE IS VERY STYLISH THEY HAVE TAKEN ALL THE GLAMOUR OF OLDE ENGLAND AND MADE IT MODERN 
THERE YOU GO AH SURPRISE 
WHAT YOU'VE GOT HERE IS RECEPTION NUMBER TWO YES UPSTAIRS WHERE ELSE WOULD YOU WANT IT 
I LIKE THIS HOW DO FEEL ABOUT YOUR LIVING ROOM ON THE SECOND FLOOR IT'S DIFFERENT ODD BUT WHY NOT 
IF YOU WANT GO AND MAKE US A CUP OF TEA WHERE HAVE YOU GOT TO GO NOW 
THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER KITCHEN NEXT DOOR LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
YOU'VE GOT AN ADVERT BREAK NOW BETWEEN YOUR PROGRAMMES SHE GOES CUP OF TEA PLEASE 
YOU'VE GOT WHAT A MINUTE AND A HALF 
BUT SURELY IF YOU USE THAT DOWNSTAIRS AS THE LIVING ROOM 
THEN THIS COULD BE ANOTHER BEDROOM 
IF I WAS IN TEA MODE WATCHING TELEVISION I'D WATCH T. V. DOWNSTAIRS NEXT TO THE KITCHEN 
O. K. SO WOULD THIS BE THE MASTER 
YES BECAUSE IT'S EN SUITE 
YOU LIKE YOUR EN SUITE 
I DO THAT'S NICE NICE SHOWER 
JUST HAVE A GO IN THERE SEE HOW IT FEELS 
JUST HAVE A GO 
THEY ARE TRYING OUT THE SHOWER NOW THANK YOU 
COME ON POUR IT OUT 
POUR IN OUT 
YOU HAVE MADE ME A PRETEND CUP OF TEA 
IS THIS ONLY THE SECOND BEDROOM WE HAVE SEEN O. K. 
THEY ARE CONFUSED BY HOW MANY BEDROOMS THEY HAVE SEEN BECAUSE THE LAYOUT MESSES WITH YOUR MIND 
OOH 
ODD ROOM O. K. NOW HERE'S A LITTLE BONUS YOU HAVE GIVEN THEM 
AND WHEN I SAY LITTLE I MEAN LITTLE A STUDY 
COULD YOU CALL THAT A STUDY 
I DON'T KNOW OR A BOXROOM 
WHAT I HAVE GIVEN THEM IS A STUDY FOR THEIR NEEDS 
I'VE NOT TAKEN SPACE AWAY FROM WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE IN BEDROOMS IN TWO LOUNGES 
I LIKE THE BATHROOM I LIKE THAT 
DID YOU HEAR THAT DID YOU HEAR WHAT LUCY SAID 
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT NO SHOWER YOU'VE GOT A SHOWER DOWNSTAIRS IN THE EN SUITE 
SO YOU DON'T REALLY NEED ONE UP HERE 
BUT THEN YOUR GUESTS HAVEN'T GOT ONE HAVE THEY 
WE HAVE GOT TWO SHOWERS AT THE MINUTE 
WE HAVE SMELLY GUESTS 
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY STAYED WITH THEM 
SO OUR GUESTS COULD HAVE LIKE THEIR OWN FLOOR ESSENTIALLY 
WITH A BEDROOM AND BATHROOM AND THE LIVING ROOM 
THE GUESTS WITH THEIR OWN FLOOR 
COULD YOUR HOUSE HAVE PROMISED THAT I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH 
I SEVERELY DOUBT IT 
DID YOUR HOUSE HAVE AN EN SUITE I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH IT IS NICE 
NO I LIKE IT IT'S A POSSIBILITY 
I LIKE THE ESTATE I LIKE THE AREA 
I STILL THINK THE PROBLEM WITH THIS HOUSE 
AND THE REASON WHY THEY'RE NOT FALLING TRULY MADLY AND DEEPLY IS THAT IT IS TOPSY TURVY 
REPLANNING TIME IT'S NOT TRUE 
KRISTIAN TOOK YOU TO CASTLE DONINGTON 
THAT'S THE HOME OF THE MONSTERS OF ROCK 
IT IS THE HOME OF HIGH SPEED MOTORBIKE RACING AND YOU HAVE GOT AN AIRPORT NEXT TO YOU YES 
EVERYTHING HERE IS JUST LOVELY 
QUAINT QUIET BEAUTIFUL THERE'S A KNITTERS MUSEUM HERE 
YOU'VE GOT PLAYING FIELDS HERITAGE CENTRE THEY HAVE GOT QUITE LITERALLY EVERYTHING IT IS NICE 
IT IS QUAINT IT IS VILLAGEY 
ALSO THIS IS NEVER ENDING FUN THERE'S A SUNDIAL HERE 
LOOK AT THIS 
STAND ON THE MONTH WE ARE IN 
AND LOOK AT WHERE YOUR SHADOW IS 
LOOK AT YOUR WATCH 
WOW 
LET'S TACKLE THE BIG ISSUE THE LAYOUT 
THIS IS THE MIND BENDING MOMENT 
WE HAVE A LOUNGE DOWNSTAIRS AND UP HERE WE HAVE A LOUNGE OPPOSITE THE BEDROOM 
M. M. M. M. M. M. 
LET US NOT BE FETTERED BY WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 
LET'S THINK IN THE LIBERAL MANNER 
DOWNSTAIRS WHAT ABOUT USING THAT LOUNGE AS A DINING ROOM THAT IS PROBABLY THE BEST OPTION FOR IT 
THEN WHERE THE DINING TABLE IS IN THE KITCHEN YOU COULD PUT A SOFA THERE 
SO CAN YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING 
SO SOFA IN THERE YOU CAN RELAX HAVE A GLASS OF WINE A CHINWAG 
THEN DINING IN THE DINING ROOM 
UP HERE STILL REMAINS THE LOUNGE 
HOW HAPPY ARE YOU ABOUT BEING THIS CLOSE FROM LOUNGING TO SLEEPING 
I QUITE LIKE THAT BECAUSE I LIKE TO KIP ON THE SOFA 
I CAN ROLL OUT OF THE LIVING ROOM INTO THE BEDROOM 
YOU COULD ALMOST IN ONE ROLL GO FROM SOFA TO BED 
AND THE ESKIMO SAID NO THAT IS JUST FROST ON MY MOUSTACHE 
I MAKE THAT ABOUT EIGHT SECONDS FROM UP THERE DOWN TO HERE NOT BAD 
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO 
WE GOT LOST 
A LOVELY HUGE HOUSE 
INTEGRATED 
THEY'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS 
BECAUSE YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE A DISHWASHER AT HOME 
VOILA 
WHERE IS THE ON SWITCH 
O. K. YOUR BUDGET IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
THIS IS A STATE OF THE ART NICE NEW BUILD PROPERTY LOTS OF SPACE SPREAD OVER THREE STOREYS 
HOW MUCH ARE YOU GOING TO BE PAYING FOR IT YOU WERE ABYSMAL LAST TIME 
YOU WERE NOT GREAT BUT YOU WERE CLOSEST 
SO I'M GOING TO LET YOU GUESS FIRST WHAT DO YOU RECKON 
I RECKON IT IS MORE LIKE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
WRONG 
I THINK TOP OF THE RANGE HOUSE BRAND NEW MOD CONS 
I'M GOING TO GO TO TWO HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE I KNOW THE PRICE 
ANDY YOU HAVE DONE SO WELL

I THINK HE CAN FLY PLANES BUT HE CAN'T GUESS PRICES 
YEAH SPEECHLESS 
LET'S GO TO THE WILD CARD 
IT'S GOT A DISHWASHER 
OH COME ON 
INTEGRATED 
THE WILD CARD A CHANCE TO GIVE FULL REIN TO THE SENSES TO SET FREE ONE'S PROPERTY MUSE AND LET IT SOAR 
YES IT IS A NICE HOUSE 
BUT IT IS PERCHED ON A HILL UP A SECLUDED PATH 
CAN'T YOU JUST FEEL THE ROMANCE 
IT'S JUST OFF THE MAIN ROAD IN CASTLE DONINGTON AND WE BOTH RECKON THEY'LL LOVE IT 
BUT THERE IS ONE LITTLE THING MISSING 
HERE WE ARE AT THE WILD CARD WHICH IS OUR JOINT CHOICE 
THE REASON WHY IT IS WILD IS THAT IT IS ALL ABOUT LOCATION 
THE MYSTERIOUS UNORTHODOX LOCATION 
THERE WE HAVE A MAIN ROAD THERE 
YOU SLIP UP THIS LITTLE PATHWAY HERE THAT WEAVES ITS WAY THROUGH THE SHRUBBERY THE OAK TREES 
AND ALL THE PARAPHERNALIA THAT YOU FIND IN GARDENS 
THERE WE SEE THE HAIRDO OF THE HOUSE LEAPING OUT BEHIND THE BUSHES 
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS A ROOF 
IT IS A NINETEENTH CENTURY WEAVER'S COTTAGE OH 
HIDDEN FOR YOUR EYES ONLY WHAT DO YOU THINK 
FROM WHAT I CAN SEE IT LOOKS INTERESTING 
NICE ROOF NICE HAIRDO 
I LIKE ALL THE SHRUBBERY 
YOU HAVE GOT A BRUSSELS SPROUT PATCH DOWN THERE 
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO LIVE WITHIN FIFTY METRES OF BRUSSELS SPROUTS

WHAT DOESN'T IT HAVE NEIGHBOURS 
IT DOESN'T HAVE NEIGHBOURS WHAT'S THAT 
BUT YOU CAN'T REACH OVER THE GARDEN FENCE AND SAY MORNING YOU CAN SHOUT AT THEM 
THERE'S A COMMUNITY FEEL ABOUT IT IT'S TIGHTKNIT TIGHTKNIT 
GET IN THERE AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK GO FOR IT 
I LIKE THAT SHE IS DOING ALL THE PUNNING

SO THIS IS YOUR DINING AREA 
IT'S A KITCHEN DINER OFFICIALLY THEY ARE SEPARATE ROOMS 
MICROWAVE IT IS REALLY NIFTY WITH THE STORAGE 
NIFTY STORAGE HELLO

DO YOU THINK THEY'RE JUST TEASING US YEAH 
THEY'RE CONVINCED THIS HOUSE IS TOO EXPENSIVE AND THIS IS THE STUDY I GUESS 
OH WOW 
DO I KNOW THIS MAN 
YOU MUST KNOW THIS MAN YOU COULD KNOCK THE PRICE DOWN IF YOU DO 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS PILOTS CAN ONLY LEGALLY LIVE 
IN HOUSES THAT OTHER PILOTS HAVE LIVED IN IS THAT A SECRET LAW 
IT'S AN INTERESTING FACT A VERY UNKNOWN FACT 
WE NEED A ROPE TO GET UP HERE 
YOU NEED TO BE AN ABSEILER 
THOSE STAIRS BEAR RESEMBLANCE TO GOING UP THE STEEP FACE OF EVEREST 
THIS MUST BE THE MASTER BEDROOM IT'S GOT THAT NICE WALLPAPER IN 
IT'S MODERN CHIC 
YOU'VE GOT MODERN CHIC IN A COTTAGEY PLACE 
HOW HAVE WE 
WE'VE YOU AND YOU 
NO NOT ME AND THE VIEWS THAT IS BEAUTIFUL 
AH SHE'S LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOWS NOW SHE'S NOW MADE IT HERS 
AMAZING 
A CROOKED TABLE IS THAT THE CARPENTER OR IS THAT THE FLOOR A CROOKED TABLE IN A CROOKED HOUSE 
IT'S OLDE WORLDE STYLE CARPENTRY THAT'S THE CHARM 
YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING TOO PERFECT LOOK I'VE GOT YOU 
OH LOOK AT THIS 
NOW THE BATHROOM IS THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE IT'S AMAZING 
JACUZZI BATH ROOM FOR TWO OH YEAH THAT'S IMPORTANT 
IMAGINE A PILOT WITH A JACUZZI BATH 
I BET ANDY ON HIS CHRISTMAS CARDS WAY BACK WHEN 
IT WOULD'VE BEEN HIM IN A JACUZZI WITH A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE WITH HIS HAT ON 
DOUBLE SHOWER AS WELL WE'D NEVER HAVE TO BATH SEPARATELY AGAIN 
WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT THAT SHOWER IT'S BIG NO DOUBLE SIZE NO 
WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT THE SHOWER COME ON 
MULTIPLE JETS 
ITS THE BARBIE ROOM EVERY HOUSE SHOULD HAVE ONE FITTED STORAGE 
STORAGE THAT'S JUST SOMETHING THEY'VE MADE 
I THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO TALK MORE ABOUT STORAGE THEY GOT MY HOPES UP 
THAT'S DOUBLE GLAZED 
SO THE ONLY WINDOW THAT'S NOT DOUBLE GLAZED IS THE MASTER BEDROOM THAT'S REALLY ODD 
YOU SEE THE NOISE OF THE ROAD IS ONLY A SLIGHT HUM 
YOU WAIT TILL THE MONSTERS OF ROCK ARE IN TOWN 
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE A SLIGHT HUM THAT'LL BE A. 
RAAAAAAAAHHH 
THAT'S NICE NICE VIEW 
IT'S TIME TO BREAK THE BAD NEWS TO THEM 
WE'VE GOT TO TELL THEM WHAT IT DOESN'T HAVE O. K. 
IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT WHILE YOU WERE WALKING AROUND THIS HOUSE SOMETHING HAPPENED 
YOU FELL IN LOVE HERE 
YEAH 
SO WHAT IS IT IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN ABOUT THIS HOUSE THAT IS MAKING YOUR HEART GO BOOM BOOM 
WE JUST WALKED IN AND IT FELT LIKE HOME 
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS HOUSE SAYS TO ME CHRISTMAS 
NOW THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I THINK IF PEOPLE GO INTO A HOUSE 
AND START THINKING CHRISTMAS OR I'LL PUT MY CHRISTMAS TREE THERE 
THAT'S A HUGE PSYCHOLOGICAL THING THAT YOU WANT 
TO SPEND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DAYS OF THE YEAR IN THAT PROPERTY 
YOU'VE BEEN SPECULATING THE HOUSE MAY BE MORE THAN YOUR BUDGET 
YOU'RE TEASING US AREN'T YOU ARE WE 
WOULD I BE THAT CRUEL YOU WOULD 
O. K. TO END SPECULATION LUCY 
LET'S GO FIND THE BOYS 
ANDY HAVE YOU SPOTTED THE FLAW IN THE WILD CARD PROPERTY

IMAGINE THAT LOOK AT THIS 
THE PEOPLE HERE THEY'VE GOT PLANNING PERMISSION 
AND THEY'VE DESIGNED THIS LOVELY LOOKING THING 
FANCY LOOKING GARAGE RECLAIMED BRICKS RECLAIMED ROSEMARY CLAY TILES 
I'D WANT TO LIVE IN THE GARAGE 
I PROBABLY WOULD ACTUALLY SO 
WE'RE HERE TALKING ABOUT GARAGES THEY'RE IN THERE DISCUSSING WHERE YOU WOULD PLACE YOUR CHRISTMAS TREE

ANDY YOU'VE DONE SO BADLY TODAY IT'S SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSING 
SO I AM GOING TO LET YOU START 
O. K. WELL LOOKING AT THE HOUSE IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PLACE A NICE AREA 
IT'S JUST WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR 
I RECKON WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
SO OVER THE BUDGET OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND YEAH 
LUCY I THINK YOU'RE DANGLING THE CARROT 
I THINK YOU'RE TEASING US I REALLY DO SO I'M GOING TO GO WHAT DID YOU SAY 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
I'M GOING TO GO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE YOU CAN'T DO THAT 
SHE HAS 
I THINK SHE DID I TELL YOU WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS I THINK THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE 
PRICE IS MAKE OR BREAK O. K. 
GO ON THEN 
THE PRICE IS JUST SHORT OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND 
YOU ARE CLOSEST 
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT REVELATION 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S TOO BAD IT'D DEPEND HOW MUCH IT'LL COST TO BUILD THIS GARAGE THAT'S THE KEY 
PEOPLE WILL MOVE A LOT ON PRICE 
THINK ABOUT THAT AND THE FACT YOU'VE SEEN THREE GREAT PROPERTIES 
NOW HERE I HAVE A LAPTOP 
ON THIS LAPTOP ARE IMAGES OF ALL THOSE THREE PROPERTIES I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS AWAY 
AND THINK LONG AND HARD ARGUE IT OUT ABOUT WHICH ONE YOU'D LIKE TO TEST DRIVE 
WE'LL FIND OUT LATER ON HERE'S THAT DISAPPEAR WE'LL SEE YOU LATER 
CHEERS SEE YOU LATER ON 
THAT WAS QUITE INTERESTING IT REALLY WAS INTERESTING DEBATE ABOUT TO BE HAD 
WHILST THEY RUMMAGE THROUGH THE IMAGES 
HERE'S A QUICK RECAP FOR YOU AT HOME 
SO WE'VE LOCKED THEM ON THE HORNS OF A DILEMMA AND IT ALL STARTED WITH MY CHOICE PROPERTY ONE 
THE VILLAGE LOCATION THE THREE STOREY PERIOD HOME THE KITCHEN DINER 
THE MAN AND ITS GARAGE NOT A BAD START AND WAY UNDER BUDGET 
BUT THEN CAME THE MODERN WORLD OF PROPERTY TWO THREE STOREYS OF CONTEMPORARY LIFESTYLE 
YOU CHOOSE WHERE YOU WANT YOUR LOUNGE OR BE GREEDY AND HAVE TWO AND THE PRICE OF MODERNITY 
AND THEN THE WILD CARD A COTTAGE SET FAIR ON A DONINGTON HILL 
JUST THE TWO FLOORS BUT IT HAD LUCY USING THE H. WORD HOME AND PLANNING HER CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS 
BUT IT'S GOT NO GARAGE FOR ANDY AND IT'S OVER THEIR BUDGET 
WHATEVER ARE THEY GOING TO DO 
THERE WE GO PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
O. K. 
I DID LIKE IT FROM THE OUTSIDE IT DID LOOK NICE CHARACTERISTIC 
HERE'S THE LIVING ROOM IT'S QUITE SMALL ISN'T IT 
IT WASN'T THAT BIG I LIKE THE FIREPLACE 
KITCHEN DID LIKE THAT 
I LIKE THE KITCHEN DINER AND THE FIREPLACE AND THINGS 
NEEDED A LOT OF WORK THOUGH BUT THERE WAS ROOM TO MANOEUVRE IN THE PRICE 
MUST BE THE MASTER BEDROOM NEXT 
YEAH DID LIKE THAT ROOM NICE AND BIG BENDY FLOORS LOT OF CHARACTER TO IT 
PROPERTY NUMBER TWO MODERN GOOD CONTRAST WITH THE FIRST ONE AS WELL 
THE DINING ROOM CUM LIVING ROOM CUM WHATEVER 
MASTER BEDROOM A BIT SMALL BUT IT'S GOT AN EN SUITE TO IT AS WELL 
THEN THE MAIN FAMILY BATHROOM 
I DID LIKE THAT FAMILY BATHROOM PROPERTY THREE YES 
VERY NICE PROPERTY 
YEAH VERY VILLAGEY 
BEAUTIFUL KITCHEN WITH A DINING ROOM 
THAT WAS GORGEOUS STRAIGHT THROUGH TO THE DINING ROOM 
O. K. I REALLY LIKE THE FLOW OF THAT HOUSE PUTS ME OFF NOT HAVING A GARAGE THOUGH 
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE VISION LOOK PAST THAT I KNOW I KNOW WHAT DO YOU RECKON 
I THINK I'VE GOT MY MIND MADE UP 
HAVE YOU YES I KNOW WHICH ONE I WANT TO TEST DRIVE 
SO ANDY AND LUCY AFTER MUCH HEAD SCRATCHING YOU HAVE DECIDED TO TEST DRIVE 
THE WILD CARD GOOD CHOICE 
NOW SNUGGLE UP CLOSE GREAT 
BEFORE WE SEND YOU IN THERE TO DO YOUR TEST DRIVE 
TREAT IT AS YOUR OWN WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD THE PROPERTY SURVEYOR GIVE THIS HOUSE A THOROUGH GOING OVER 
BUT WE'D STRESS BEFORE YOU BUY YOUR OWN HOUSE 
YOU GET YOUR OWN STRUCTURAL SURVEY CARRIED OUT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE 
HE'S GOT SOME INTERESTING THINGS TO TELL US THAT ROOF 
YOU SPOTTED IT ANDY YOU SAID LOOKS A BIT WOBBLY BIT BENDY 
THE SURVEYOR HAS BEEN IN THERE HE SAID IT LOOKS A BIT WOBBLY AND BENDY WENT INSIDE 
COS HE WAS A BIT CLEVERER THAN US HE LOOKED AT THE CEILING AND SAID THEY'RE ALL FLAT 
IT HASN'T IMPACTED ON THE CEILINGS IT LOOKS IN KEEPING WITH THE PROPER TY 
EVERYONE LOVES A BENDY ROOF DON'T THEY 
MEANWHILE EXTRA INFORMATION HERE 
BECAUSE AS THE HOUSE WAS BUILT ON A HILL THE HILL GOES UP THE HOUSE IS BUILT INTO IT 
SO YOU GET THE REAR OF THE HOUSE THE SOIL IS THIS LEVEL 
YOUR INTERNAL FLOORS ARE THIS LEVEL WHICH MEANS YOU COULD GET DAMP INGRESS 
THERE IS SIGN OF A DAMP COURSE IT MIGHT NEED UPDATING SO GET SOMEONE TO CHECK IT 
ON THE PLUS POINTS HE LOVED THE EXTENSION 
HE STARTED SKIPPING WHEN HE SAW IT 
FOR HIM THAT'S A VERY EXCITING THING TO SEE STARTED SKIPPING 
EXTRAORDINARY SIGHT THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY 
GET IN THERE TELL US WHAT YOU THINK IT'S YOUR TEST DRIVE ENJOY IT 
LEGALLY YOU'VE GOT HALF AN HOUR'S RIGHTS TO EVERYTHING IN THERE 
GO ON GO GO GO 
GONE THEY'VE GONE 
THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO TEST DRIVE A PROPERTY BUT FRANKLY I ALWAYS LIKE TO SEE THE YOUNG UNS INVOLVED 
GRACIE'S IN BUT ANDY HAS ANNEXED HIMSELF 
HE'S SAMPLING THE LOCAL LANES ON HIS SUPER DUPER SOUPED UP RACING BIKE 
WELL WITH HIM OUT OF HARM'S WAY TIME FOR LUCY TO ENTER THE BOSOM OF THE COMMUNITY 
BRACE YOURSELF CASTLE DONINGTON

STILL VERY VILLAGEY VERY VILLAGEY 
OH EVERYBODY LIKES TO KNOW EVERYBODY ELSE 
OH YES VERY VILLAGEY AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO BE TEST DRIVING A HOUSE

I WOULDN'T WANT SOMEONE TAMPERING WITH MY UNDERGARMENTS AT ALL TIMES OF DAY WOULD YOU 
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT BUT THINGS ARE LOOKING UP 
ONE TWO THREE 
AFTER A GOOD SORTING OUT AND HERE I SPEAK FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

POTENTIALLY YOUR NEW KITCHEN TABLE MAYBE OR NOT WHAT DO YOU RECKON

REALLY LIKE IT THE AMBIENCE IS STILL APPEALING CHRISTMASSY ALL YEAR ROUND 
O. K. THERE IS A MORE IMPORTANT QUESTION HERE 
TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
THAT IS THE QUESTION WE ARE GOING TO PUT AN OFFER IN 
ARE YOU WE'RE GOING TO NEGOTIATE 
OOH 
HOPEFULLY THERE'LL BE ROOM FOR NEGOTIATION IN THE PRICE 
EXCELLENT I HOPE YOU GET IT BECAUSE I THINK IT SUITS YOU 
I MEAN THAT FROM IN THERE 
THANK YOU FOR FINDING IT FOR US

BUT LET'S NOT DO WHAT WE ALWAYS DO AND HAVE A CAPPUCCINO AND A BOWL FULL OF ICE CREAM 
LET'S GO AND HAVE A SAUNA AND THINK ABOUT PROPERTY 
O. K. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING RETROSPECTIVE ABOUT THE SUCCESS WE'VE ACHIEVED WE'VE DONE WELL

I FIND THAT KIND OF SCARY
