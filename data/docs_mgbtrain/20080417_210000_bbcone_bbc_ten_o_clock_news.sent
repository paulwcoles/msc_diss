WITH THE OPPOSITION ABOUT FORMING A 
GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY THE 
CLAIMS ARE MADE BY THE OPPOSITION 
LEADER IN HIS FIRST BRITISH 
TELEVISION INTERVIEW SINCE THE 
DISPUTED ELECTION

UNDERSTOOD WAS THAT FOR THE FIRST 
DAY THEY'VE TRIED TO PERSUADE 
MUGABE TREKS UP TO CONSIDER DEFEAT 
BY THE SECOND AND THIRD DAY THE 
SITUATION HAD CHANGED 
WE HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
ALSO TONIGHT 
THE HARDLINE CLERIC WHO HECKLED A 
HOME SECRETARY IS CONVICTED OF 
INCITING TERRORISM 
ALL SMILES AT THE WHITE HOUSE BUT 
GORDON BROWN CAN'T ESCAPE HIS 
PROBLEMS AT HOME 
AT THE SENSE OF 
ALARM AND OF RESENTMENT LIES NOT 
WITH THE IMMIGRANT POPULATION BUT 
WITH THOSE AMONG WHOM THEY HAVE 
COME UP AND ARE STILL COMING 
FORTY YEARS AFTER ENOCH POWELL'S 
RIVERS OF BLOOD SPEECH WE REVEAL 
TODAY'S ATTITUDES TO IMMIGRATION 
AND CHELSEA FIGHT BACK IN THE RACE 
FOR THE TITLE 
IN B. B. C. LONDON NEWS 
IS THE B. N. P. ABOUT TO MAKE HISTORIC 
GAINS IN THE LONDON ELECTIONS 
AND A WOMAN'S KILLED BY TRAIN AT A RAILWAY CROSSING 
GOOD EVENING 
ROBERT MUGABE CAME CLOSE TO BEING 
FORCED FROM OFFICE BY HIS OWN PARTY 
AFTER ZIMBABWE'S PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION THE B. B. C. HAS LEARNED THAT 
SECRET TALKS TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THE 
OPPOSITION M. D. C. AND SENIOR FIGURES 
FROM ZANU P. F. MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
THE M. D. C. LEADER IN HIS FIRST 
BRITISH TELEVISION INTERVIEW TOLD 
US THAT THE TALKS BROKE DOWN AND 
THAT ZIMBABWE IS NOW SUFFERING 
WIDESPREAD VIOLENCE AS MR. MUGABE 
TRIES TO CLING TO POWER HE WAS 
SPEAKING TO OUR SPECIAL 
CORRESPONDENT ALLAN LITTLE 
IT IS NINETEEN DAYS SINCE THEY STOOD IN 
LINE TO VOTE THERE WAS LITTLE OR 
NONE OF THE CUSTOMARY VIOLENCE THE 
VOTING WAS TRANSPARENT THE 
COUNTING SWIFT AND THEN FOR THREE 
WEEKS A SILENCE ZIMBABWE WAITS IN 
GROWING TREPIDATION TO FIND OUT WHY 
THERE IS STILL NO RESULT TONIGHT 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI TOLD ME SENIOR 
MEMBERS OF MR. MUGABE'S REGIME 
SHOCKED BY THE SCALE OF THEIR 
DEFEAT APPROACHED HIM TO TALK 
ABOUT TRANSITION OF POWER THE THE REALITY HAD DAWNED ON THEM THAT 
THEY HAD LOST THE ELECTION AND I 
THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF 
PANDEMONIUM AND PANIC THEY STARTED 
BY APPROACHING US TO SAY LET'S TALK 
ABOUT TRANSITION 
WHAT WERE THEY 
ARE ASKING YOU FOR WHAT 
GUARANTEES 
WELL A GOVERNMENT OF GUARANTEES NATIONAL UNITY ACCOMMODATION 
SECURITY CONCERNS AND THOSE KIND OF 
THINGS WHICH WE WERE READILY 
PREPARED TO DISCUSS 
AND WERE YOU 
PREPARED TO GIVE THEM GUARANTEES 
THEY WOULD NOT BE PROSECUTED 
ABSOLUTELY 
INCLUDING MR. MUGABE ABSOLUTELY INCLUDING MR. MUGABE GUARANTEES GUARANTEES THAT THE TOP MILITARY COULD KEEP 
THEIR JOBS 
EVERYONE COULD KEEP 
THEIR JOBS WE HAD NO INTENTION OF 
REVENGE THAT WHOEVER HAD TO LEAVE 
WOULD DO SO VOLUNTARILY AND NOT BY 
FORCE 
WHAT ABOUT A GOVERNMENT OF FORCE NATIONAL UNITY 
WE WERE PREPARED TO 
CONSIDER THE ISSUE OF AN INCLUSIVE 
GOVERNMENT INCLUDING MEMBERS OF 
ZANU P. F. THEY WERE SUGGESTING HOW 
MANY AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A 
PANEL FROM WHICH WE WOULD CHOOSE 
AFTER TWO DAYS THE M. D. C. THOUGHT 
THEY WERE CLOSE TO STRIKING A DEAL 
TONIGHT THE PRESSURE MOUNTS ON 
ROBERT MUGABE AS THE OPPOSITION 
DECLARES VICTORY 
MORGAN TSVANGIRAI 
IS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE 
REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE 
THEN THE DIALOGUE SUDDENLY CHANGED 
THE HARDLINERS HAD BEGUN TO 
REASSERT THEMSELVES 
THE VERY SAME 
PEOPLE WHO WERE COMING TO US FOR 
DISCUSSION ORGANISED A MEETING AND 
DID NOT TURN UP FOR ALMOST TWO 
HOURS OUR GUYS LEFT WE REALISED 
THE SITUATION HAD CHANGED AND THEY 
WERE BACK TO THEIR PLAN 
WHAT WENT 
WRONG WHAT HAPPENED TO ALLOW THE 
HARDLINERS TO REASSERT CONTROL I I AM SURE THAT THE HARDLINERS JUST 
PUT A STAND THROUGH THE MILITARY 
THE VIOLENCE THAT HAD BEEN LACKING 
DURING THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN IS 
BACK M. D. C. CANDIDATES AND POLLING 
AGENTS HAVE BEEN BEATEN AT LEAST 
ONE KILLED MORGAN TSVANGIRAI TOLD 
ME THERE WERE NOW NO CIRCUMSTANCES 
IN WHICH HE WOULD CONTEST A SECOND 
ROUND RUN OFF 
WE CAN TALK TO ALLAN LITTLE NOW IN 
JOHANNESBURG HOW CLOSE DID THEY 
COME TO STRIKING A DEAL IN THAT 
FIRST DAY 
THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY 
THOUGHT THEY WERE COMING VERY CLOSE 
THE BIG UNKNOWN QUESTION IS WHAT MR. 
MUGABE WANTED TO DO IN ANOTHER 
PART OF THAT INTERVIEW MORGAN 
TSVANGIRAI USED THE PHRASE THAT THE 
HARDLINERS HAD PERSUADED MR. MUGABE 
TO STAY ON THAT SUGGESTS THE 
RECALCITRANT PEOPLE IN THE EQUATION 
HERE NOT MR. MUGABE HIMSELF BUT 
THOSE AROUND HIM WHO FEAR 
RETRIBUTION SHOULD HE BE ALLOWED AS 
AN INDIVIDUAL TO GO INTO QUIET AND 
DIGNIFIED RETIREMENT THAT MAY BE 
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE RULING 
CIRCLES 
THANK YOU CIRCLES YOU CAN SEE THE FULL VERSION OF

MANNER WAS SHOUTED DOWN BY AN 
EXTREMIST 
A DIALOGUE WHEN THEY EXTREMIST COME TO YOUR HOUSE THEY ARE NOT 
GOING TO SAY ASSALAAM ALAIKUM THEY

MOSQUE ONE NIGHT IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND FOUR 
WHEN FEELINGS WERE RUNNING HIGH 
BECAUSE OF THE FIGHTING IN FALLUJAH 
IN IRAQ IT WAS THE MUSLIM HOLY 
MONTH OF RAMADAN AND HUNDREDS OF 
WORSHIPPERS WERE ATTENDING DID WELL 
ATTENDED MOSQUE EACH NIGHT BUT 
AMONG THEM WERE A GROUP OF 
EXTREMISTS MAKING HATE FILLED 
SPEECHES IN THE CENTRE OF THE MAIN 
PRAYER HALL AND FILMING IT THE 
POLICE WILL NOT RELEASE THAT VIDEO 
BUT THIS FOOTAGE OBTAINED BY THE 
B. B. C. SHOWS ABU IZZADEEN SPEAKING IN 
THE MOSQUE A FEW DAYS EARLIER AT 
ONE POINT HE TALKS ABOUT THE 
BEHEADING OF KEN BIGLEY 
THOSE WHO 
COME WITH THE AMERICANS BE THEY 
KENNETH BIGLEY THE AMERICANS 
POLISH OR THE NORWEGIANS DON'T BE 
SURPRISED IF WE SEE THEM BEING

IN SPEAKING TO THE B. B. C. FOUR YEARS 
AGO ABOUT NINE ELEVEN 
YOU ARE CRYING 
ABOUT THE FACT THAT AMERICA THE 
OPPRESSOR HAS BEEN PUNCHED IN THE 
NOSE 
THE JURY FAILED TO AGREE ON NOSE WHETHER THIS SPEECH BY ABU IZZADEEN 
AMOUNTED TO ENCOURAGING TERRORISM 
WITH ALL THE SECURITY THE C. C. T. V. 
CAMERAS ALL OF THE AWARENESS ABOUT 
TERRORISM IT DID NOT HELP IN THE 
END YOU CANNOT STOP SOMEONE WHO IS 
DETERMINED TO DIE 
IZZADEEN AND HIS 
CO DEFENDANTS WILL BE SENTENCED 
TOMORROW TOMORROW GORDON BROWN INSISTS HE WAS RIGHT 
TO ABOLISH THE TEN PENCE RATE OF 
INCOME TAX AND HAS REJECTED THE 
LATEST CALLS TO RECONSIDER HE WAS 
SPEAKING AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE 
HE HAD BEEN HOLDING TALKS WITH 
PRESIDENT BUSH MR. BROWN WAS 
APPARENTLY FORCED TO INTERRUPT HIS 
VISIT TO SPEAK TO A JUNIOR MEMBER 
OF HIS GOVERNMENT WHO WAS 
THREATENING TO RESIGN OVER THE TAX 
CHANGES LET'S JOIN NICK ROBINSON 
IN WASHINGTON 
GORDON BROWN CAME HERE WITH A BIG 
MISSION TO CONVINCE THIS COUNTRY'S 
LEADERS THE PRESENT LEADERSHIP AND 
THOSE TO COME THAT AMERICA AND 
BRITAIN COULD WORK TOGETHER JUST AS 
CLOSELY UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP AS 
THEY HAD UNDER TONY BLAIR'S WHAT 
HE DID NOT COUNT ON THOUGH WAS 
HAVING TO CONTEND WITH A LITTLE 
LOCAL DIFFICULTY 
TODAY GORDON BROWN MET THE NEXT 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
ALTHOUGH LIKE US HE DOES NOT KNOW 
YET WHETHER IT WILL BE BARACK OBAMA 
OR HIS OLD FRIEND HILLARY CLINTON 
WHO ONCE SOARED IN THE POLLS OR 
JOHN MCCAIN WHOEVER IS IN THE 
WHITE HOUSE THE PRIME MINISTER IS 
DETERMINED THAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP 
WILL BE VERY SPECIAL SO DETERMINED 
THAT TODAY HE AND THE SOON TO BE 
FORMER PRESIDENT LAVISHED PRAISE ON 
EACH OTHER 
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY 
THE WORLD OWES PRESIDENT GEORGE 
BUSH A HUGE DEBT OF GRATITUDE FOR 
LEADING THE WORLD IN OUR 
DETERMINATION TO ROOT OUT TERRORISM 
LIKE TONY BLAIR HE SAID THAT TWO 
MEN STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER IF IF THERE WAS NOT A PERSONAL 
RELATIONSHIP I WOULD NOT BE 
INVITING THE MAN TO IN NICE 
HAMBURGER WELL DONE I MIGHT ADD 
IF ONLY THINGS AT HOME WERE GOING 
SO WELL WHILE THE PRIME MINISTER 
HAS BEEN AWAY FIRST THE CHANCELLOR 
DECLARED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO 
SHARPEN ITSELF UP THEN LABOUR'S 
LORD DESAI SAID HIS LEADER HAD BEEN 
PUT ON EARTH TO REMIND PEOPLE HOW 
COULD TONY BLAIR WAS FINALLY 
ANGELA SMITH THREATENED TO RESIGN 
HER JUNIOR GOVERNMENT POST IN 
PROTEST AT THE SCRAPPING OF THE TEN P. 
TAX RATE THE PRIME MINISTER HAD TO 
SPEAK TO HER FROM THE WHITE HOUSE 
ITSELF ONLY THEN DID SHE DECLARE 
THAT SHE WOULD NOT QUIT L. ASKED 
ABOUT THE UNWELCOME DISTRACTIONS 
FROM THE BUSINESS HE HAS BEEN 
PURSUING HERE WHAT IS GOING WRONG 
IN YOUR PARTY IN GOVERNMENT AND 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT 
I AM STICKING TO THE JOB AND 
GETTING ON WITH THE JOB AND I 
THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE 
IS A DIFFICULT SITUATION AROUND THE 
WORLD 
AND HE SAID ON THE TEN P. TAX WORLD RATE HE WOULD NOT BACK DOWN WHAT WHAT ARE THE QUESTIONS PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT 
THESE CHANGES CAN BE ANSWERED YES 
THEY ARE IMPORTANT CHANGES THEY 
MOVE THE ECONOMY FORWARD 
ON THE 
CREDIT CRUNCH IRAQ AFGHANISTAN 
CLIMATE CHANGE OR GLOBAL POVERTY 
GORDON BROWN HAS BEEN TRYING TO 
MAKE FRIENDS HERE ONLY TO FIND 
THAT BACK HOME HIS FRIENDS ARE 
DESERTING HIM 
IN THE LONG RUN IT MATTERS MUCH 
MORE THE RELATIONSHIP THAT GORDON 
BROWN FORMS HERE AND ALSO THE 
AGREEMENTS THAT HE CAN REACH 
WHETHER ON IRAN OR ZIMBABWE OR THE 
REST MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN OF 
COURSE AN AID TO A GOVERNMENT 
MINISTER WHO IN THE END DID NOT 
RESIGN HOWEVER WHAT IS 
SIGNIFICANT AND HAS BEEN BUILDING 
THROUGHOUT THE TRIP IS SIGNS THAT 
THE GLUE THAT ONCE HELD LOOK ONCE 
HELD NEW LABOUR SO TIGHTLY TOGETHER 
THE CLUES TO BE WEAKENING 
APPEARS TO BE WEAKENING 
TWO THIRDS OF BRITISH PEOPLE FEEL 
THAT RACE RELATIONS ARE SO BAD THAT 
TENSIONS ARE LIKELY TO TURN INTO 
VIOLENCE A SURVEY FOR THE TEN 
O'CLOCK NEWS FOUND THAT A CLEAR 
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THE 
LEVEL OF IMMIGRATION HAS BEEN TOO 
HIGH THE FINDINGS ARE PUBLISHED FORTY 
YEARS AFTER THE CONSERVATIVE 
POLITICIAN ENOCH POWELL DELIVERED 
HIS CONTROVERSIAL SPEECH PREDICTING 
WIDESPREAD VIOLENCE AND LESS 
IMMIGRATION UNLESS IMMIGRATION 
WENT AND CHECKED 
IT IS SEVEN YEARS SINCE BRITAIN 
LAST EXPERIENCED WIDESPREAD RACE 
RIOTS VIOLENT CLASHES ACROSS 
ENGLAND'S NORTHERN TOWNS SERIOUS 
AS THEY WERE A DECADE OF RECORD 
IMMIGRATION HAS BEEN GREETED WITH 
REMARKABLY LITTLE HOSTILITY OR 
OPPOSITION HOWEVER TODAY'S POLL 
SUGGESTS PEOPLE FEEL THAT PROBLEMS 
LIE AHEAD THE SURVEY SHOWS THREE 
OUT OF FOUR THINK THERE IS A GREAT 
DEAL OR A FAIR AMOUNT OF TENSION 
BETWEEN RACES AND NATIONALITIES 
ALMOST TWO OUT OF THREE FEAR THAT 
THAT TENSION IS CERTAIN OR LIKELY 
TO LEAD TO VIOLENCE 
WHAT WORRIES 
ME IS IF THAT FRICTION STARTS TO 
CATCH FIRE IF PEOPLE GENUINELY 
BELIEVE IT IS GOING TO CATCH FIRE 
WE ARE IN TROUBLE WHAT I WOULD SAY 
IS THAT THIS FINDING MAY REFLECT 
NOT WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY BUT THE 
STORY THAT HAS BEEN TOLD OVER THE 
LAST FORTY YEARS 
BECAUSE IT IS FORTY 
YEARS SINCE ENOCH POWELL SPOKE TO A 
SMALL GATHERING IN BIRMINGHAM'S 
MIDLANDS HOTEL AND HIS WORDS STILL 
HANG OVER THE DEBATE ON IMMIGRATION 
THE SENSE OF ALARM AND RESENTMENT 
LIES NOT WITH THE IMMIGRANT 
POPULATION BUT WITH THOSE AMONG 
WHOM THEY HAVE COME AND ARE STILL 
COMING 
WHAT THAT SPEECH DID WAS COMING THE OPPOSITE OF ITS INTENTION IT 
FORCED THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION OFF 
THE POLITICAL AGENDA IT BECAME A 
NO GO AREA AND ANY POLITICIAN 
VENTURING IN WOULD BE ACCUSED OF 
PLAYING THE RACE CARD A SITUATION 
THAT STILL EXISTS FORTY YEARS LATER 
FIVE MONTHS AGO A TORY CANDIDATE IN 
BIRMINGHAM WAS FORCED TO STEP DOWN 
BY DAVID CAMERON FOR SAYING THAT 
ENOCH POWELL WAS RIGHT THAT 
UNCONTROLLED IMMIGRATION WOULD 
CHANGE OUR COUNTRY IRREVOCABLY BUT 
TODAY'S POLL FINDS THAT 
INCREASINGLY PEOPLE SHARE THAT VIEW 
ONE OUT OF FOUR THOUGHT IMMIGRATION 
MEANT THEIR LOCAL AREA DID NOT FEEL 
LIKE BRITAIN ANY MORE SIX OUT OF 
TEN SAID IMMIGRATION HAD MADE PARTS 
OF BRITAIN FEEL LIKE A FOREIGN 
COUNTRY 
IT IS NOT RACIST TO TALK COUNTRY ABOUT IMMIGRATION 
WHEN TORY LEADER 
MICHAEL HOWARD SUGGESTED 
COMMUNITIES COULD NOT COPE WITH THE 
PACE OF IMMIGRATION INTO ONE THOUSAND FIVE HE 
WAS PILLORIED 
THOSE POLITICIANS 
WHO WERE VULNERABLE BECAUSE OF 
THEIR POLICIES ON IMMIGRATION 
ATTEMPTED TO INTIMIDATE PEOPLE INTO 
NOT RAISING IT BY CRYING RACISM 
ACCUSING US OF PLAYING THE RACE 
CARD 
IMMIGRATION IS NO LONGER OFF CARD LIMITS IN PART BECAUSE THE LATEST 
WAVE OF IMMIGRANTS ARE DIFFERENT 
THE ONE MILLION EASTERN EUROPEANS WHO 
HAVE COME TO THE U. K. ARE NOT LOOKING 
TO SETTLE THEIR MOTIVES ARE 
ECONOMIC AND PERHAPS MOST 
CRITICALLY THEY ARE WHITE THE 
ISSUES OF IMMIGRATION AND RACE 
FUSED TOGETHER BY ENOCH POWELL 
APPEAR TO BE SEPARATE IN THE POLL 
FINDINGS SIX OUT OF TEN SAID THERE 
ARE TOO MANY IMMIGRANTS HALF SAID 
FOREIGNERS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO 
RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN 
BUT THE PROPORTION WHO ADMITTED 
RACIAL PREJUDICE HAS FALLEN TO TWENTY PER CENT 
THE LOWEST EVER RECORDED FORTY YEARS 
AFTER WARNINGS OF RIVERS OF BLOOD 
GOVERNMENT MINISTERS ACCEPT THAT 
THE CHURN AND CHANGE ASSOCIATED 
WITH A RECORD IMMIGRATION IS 
LEADING TO ATTENTION BUT THEY 
INSIST PUSHED SOCIAL COHESION 
REMAINS STRONG AND THAT WILL DECIDE 
WHETHER PEOPLE'S FEARS BECOME 
REALITY REALITY COMING UP 
DOZENS OF BUILDING FIRMS COULD FACE 
SIGNIFICANT FINES AFTER BEING 
ACCUSED OF RIGGING BIDS FOR 
CONTRACTS CONTRACTS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD YOUTH ACCUSED OF 
MURDERING THE LIVERPOOL SCHOOL BOY

BUT TODAY AMIDST A TIGHT SECURITY 
SIX DEFENDANTS ARRIVED AT LIVERPOOL 
MAGISTRATES' COURT ALL CHARGED IN 
CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER OF RHYS

HERE AT LIVERPOOL MAGISTRATES' 
COURT RHYS'S PARENTS CAME FACE TO 
FACE WITH THE WOMAN WHOSE OWN SON 
IS ACCUSED OF KILLING RHYS WHEN 
THE CHARGE WAS READ OUT AGAINST THE 
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD RHYS'S MOTHER MELANIE 
BEGAN TO CRY AT SOME POINTS DURING 
THE HEARING SHE ALSO SHOOK HER 
HEAD IN DISBELIEF AND AFTER NINETY 
MINUTES IN COURT THEY BOTH CAME 
OUT KNOWING THAT TODAY WAS JUST 
THE BEGINNING ANY FUTURE TRIAL 
WOULD BE WEEKS AWAY MEANWHILE AT 
RHYS'S SCHOOL TODAY PEOPLE 
CHILDREN WERE PLAYING IN THE AREA 
DEDICATED TO HIM EVEN HERE ALL 
THOUGHTS WERE ON THE INVESTIGATION 
WE HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING AND IT 
HAS AFFECTED THE SCHOOL GREATLY 
AND WE ALL FEEL VERY STRONGLY FOR 
THE PARENTS 
RHYS JONES WAS JUST 
LIKE ANY OTHER ELEVEN YEAR OLD BOY 
THAT IS WHY THIS INVESTIGATION HAS 
COURT PEOPLE'S ATTENTION AND 
DOMINATED THE HEADLINES TONIGHT 
ALL SIX DEFENDANTS ARE IN CUSTODY 
THEY ARE DUE TO APPEAR IN COURT 
AGAIN NEXT FRIDAY 
THE WORLD'S BIGGEST INVESTMENT BANK 
MERRILL LYNCH IS CUTTING TEN PER CENT OF 
ITS WORK FORCE AFTER WRITING OFF 
ANOTHER THREE BILLION OF BAD DEBT 
ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND JOBS WILL GO INCLUDING 
SOME IN LONDON MERRILL LYNCH HAS 
NOW WRITTEN OFF MORE THAN FIFTEEN 
BILLION IN TOTAL MAINLY DUE TO THE 
SUB PRIME MORTGAGE CRISIS IN THE U. S. 
DOZENS OF BUILDING FIRMS COULD FACE 
SIGNIFICANT FINES AFTER BEING 
ACCUSED OF RIGGING BIDS FOR 
CONTRACTS THE OFFICE OF FAIR 
TRADING SAID THAT ONE HUNDRED TWELVE FIRMS 
INCLUDING SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES 
IN CONSTRUCTION HAD COLLUDED WHILE 
BIDDING FOR DEALS TO BUILD SCHOOLS 
AND HOSPITALS THE PRACTICE MAY 
HAVE COST THE TAXPAYER TENS OF 
MILLIONS OF POUNDS AS JOHN MOYLAN 
REPORTS REPORTS IT IS ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST 
INDUSTRIES IT AMOUNTS TO AROUND 
TEN PER CENT OF THE ECONOMY BUT NOW THE 
CONSTRUCTION WORLD FACES 
ACCUSATIONS OF FINANCIAL WRONGDOING 
WHICH MAY HAVE CHEATED TAXPAYERS 
OUT OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS TODAY 
THE OFFICE OF FAIR TRADING LEVELLED 
ALLEGATIONS OF RIGGING BIDS AGAINST 
ONE HUNDRED TWELVE FIRMS AMONG THEM CARILLON 
BALFOUR BEATTY SOME OF THE BEST 
KNOWN NAMES IN THE BUSINESS WE WE CERTAINLY DID COME ACROSS EVIDENCE 
THAT MAY BE THOUSANDS OF CONTRACTS 
HAD BEEN AFFECTED IN THIS WAY 
WORTH POTENTIALLY OVER ONE BILLION 
SO HOW DID THE BUILDERS RID THE 
PRICES TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE 
CONSTRUCTION OF NEW SCHOOL THE 
BUDGET IS TEN MILLION THREE FIRMS 
ARE ASKED TO TENDER BUT THEY 
COLLUDE ON THE PRICE 
WHEN THE NEXT PROJECT COMES UP FOR 
TEND THEY ARE COLLUDE AGAIN TO LET 
COMPANY B. WIN THIS TIME THAT IS 
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE 
REDEVELOPMENT OF BIRMINGHAM'S 
BULLRING FOUR FIRMS WERE INVITED 
TO TENDER FOR SOME OF THE ROOFING 
WORK THEY SHARED DETAILS OF THEIR 
PLANNED BIDS TWO WERE ARTIFICIALLY 
HIGH SOME ALSO RECEIVED HIDDEN 
COMPENSATION PAYMENTS THE VICTIMS 
OF ALL OF THIS ARE THE PUBLIC AND 
PRIVATE ORGANISATIONS THAT ASKED 
THESE BUILDING COMPANIES TO TENDER 
FOR WORK IN THE FIRST PLACE 
ALREADY MANY LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE 
MAKING IT CLEAR THAT IF SOME OF 
THESE COMPANIES ARE FINED THAT 
MONEY SHOULD BYPASS THE TREASURY 
AND COME STRAIGHT BACK TO THEM IT IT IS THE COUNCIL TAXPAYER WHO IS THE 
VICTIM HERE THE COUNCIL TAXPAYER 
SHOULD RECEIVE SOME KIND OF 
COMPENSATION FOR THAT 
AS FOR THE INDUSTRY TODAY IT 
PLAYED DOWN THE BID RIGGING 
ALLEGATIONS 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO ALLEGATIONS IT IS ONLY WHEN YOU HAVE A SINGLE 
STAGE COMPETITOR TENDER BASED ON 
LOWEST PRICE THAT IS THE MINORITY 
OF THE F. T. WAY CONSTRUCTION IS PER 
CURED RATHER THAN THE MAJORITY THE THE FIRMS HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO RESPOND TO 
THE ALLEGATIONS
