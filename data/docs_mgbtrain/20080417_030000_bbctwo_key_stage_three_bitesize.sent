HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE THIRD SCIENCE PROGRAMME 
IN THE KEY STAGE THREE BITESIZE REVISION SERIES 
THIS THIRD PROGRAMME IS DESIGNED FOR YOU 
IF YOU'RE TAKING THE HIGHER TIER PAPER WHICH COVERS LEVELS FIVE TO SEVEN 
THERE ARE TWO TIERS OF TEST PAPER FOR SCIENCE THAT YOU CAN TAKE 
AND YOUR TEACHER WILL DECIDE WHICH ONE IS BEST FOR YOU 
YOU MAY TAKE LEVELS THREE TO SIX 
OR THE HIGHER PAPER WHICH COVERS LEVELS FIVE TO SEVEN 
THE TIERS DO OVERLAP AND MANY QUESTIONS APPEAR IN BOTH PAPERS 
BUT THE HIGHER LEVEL PAPER INCLUDES MORE DEMANDING QUESTIONS 
WE'LL LOOK IN GREATER DETAIL AT THE TOPICS IN THE HIGHER LEVEL PAPER 
WE'LL HAVE PRACTICE QUESTIONS TIPS AND CRUCIAL KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER 
SO WHAT'S COMING UP 
THERE ARE THREE MAIN SECTIONS IN THE PROGRAMME 
FIRST THOUGH A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE HIGHER TIER PAPER 
IF YOU'RE TAKING THE HIGHER TIER PAPERS THIS PROGRAMME IS FOR YOU 
BUT YOU MUST WATCH THE OTHER PROGRAMMES TOO 
TO COVER ALL THE TOPICS FOR YOUR EXAMS 
DON'T TACKLE THIS PROGRAMME IN ONE GO YOU'LL BE MORE EFFICIENT 
IF YOU SPREAD YOUR REVISION OVER A NUMBER OF WEEKS 
HERE ARE A FEW MORE TOP TIPS 
MY TOP REVISION TIP WOULD BE TO REVISE IN MANY SHORT PERIODS 
INSTEAD OF ONE LONG ENDLESS PERIOD 
HERE ARE SOME POINTS TO BEAR IN MIND FOR THE HIGHER TIER PAPERS 
FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT READ THE QUESTIONS CAREFULLY 
THERE WILL BE CLUES IN THE QUESTION THAT WILL HELP YOU WITH YOUR ANSWER 
DON'T RUSH THE FIRST QUESTIONS THEY MAY SEEM EASIER 
BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF MARKS TO BE PICKED UP HERE SO TAKE YOUR TIME 
FOR INSTANCE A LIGHT WAVE IS REFLECTED 
NOT BOUNCED OFF A MIRROR 
YOU CAN PICK UP MARKS BY USING THE CORRECT UNITS 
KNOWING YOUR WORK WILL MAKE YOU MORE CONFIDENT 
AND HELP WITH ANSWERING QUESTIONS 
SO LET'S GET STARTED 
THE FIRST AREA WE'LL LOOK AT IS BIOLOGY 
IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THIS 
FAST FORWARD TO THE CHEMISTRY OR PHYSICS SECTIONS 
THE BIOLOGY SECTIONS ARE IN THREE UNITS 
THIS UNIT IS SPLIT INTO THREE MAIN SECTIONS 
LET'S START WITH ENERGY IN FOOD WEBS 
WE WILL RUN THROUGH WHAT YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW ABOUT FOOD CHAINS 
FOOD CHAINS SHOW IN ANY PARTICULAR HABITAT WHAT IS EATEN BY WHAT 
THIS FISH TANK REPRESENTS A TYPICAL HABITAT 
A MURKY GARDEN POND TEEMING WITH ORGANISMS 
ONE FOOD CHAIN HERE COULD START WITH WATERWEED WHICH IS EATEN BY TADPOLES 
WHICH IN TURN WOULD BE EATEN BY LARGER CARNIVORES 
WATER BEETLES AND FISH SUCH AS MINNOWS 
IN A FOOD CHAIN THE ARROWS ALWAYS GO FROM FOOD TO FEEDER 
SO IN THIS CASE FROM WATERWEED TO TADPOLES TO MINNOWS 
IN A TEST YOU WILL OFTEN GET DIAGRAMS LIKE THIS 
THE FOOD CHAIN HAS BECOME A LOT MORE COMPLICATED AND IS NOW A FOOD WEB 
THE SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES THE ARROWS GO FROM FOOD TO FEEDER 
BUT HERE WE HAVE ADDED WATER BEETLES PERCH THEN PIKE 
AND TOP CARNIVORES OTTERS 
THESE ARROWS ALSO REPRESENT 
THE DIRECTION OF ENERGY FLOW THROUGH A HABITAT 
AND AS YOU GO UP A FOOD CHAIN THE NUMBER OF ORGANISMS DECREASES 
LOOKING AT ANOTHER FOOD CHAIN WE START WITH LEAVES 
THAT ARE EATEN BY CATERPILLARS 
THEN WOODPECKERS 
AND FINALLY THE TOP CARNIVORE IS A KESTREL 
GOING UP A FOOD CHAIN THE NUMBER OF ORGANISMS USUALLY DECREASES 
BECAUSE SO LITTLE OF THE ENERGY 
IS TRANSFERRED FROM ONE ORGANISM TO ANOTHER 
BUT IF THE PRODUCER IS VERY LARGE 
AND SUPPORTS VERY SMALL PRIMARY CONSUMERS 
FOR EXAMPLE AN OAK TREE BEING EATEN BY HUNDREDS OF CATERPILLARS 
THE PYRAMID OF NUMBERS MAY HAVE AN UNUSUAL SHAPE 
BUT HOW MUCH IS PASSED ON 
IF WE USE THIS SPOT OF SUNLIGHT 
TO REPRESENT THE SUN'S LIGHT ENERGY SHINING ON A GREEN PLANT 
HOW MUCH DOES THE PLANT MANAGE TO CONVERT TO STORED FOOD ENERGY 
ONLY ONE FIVE HUNDREDTH OF THE SUN'S LIGHT ENERGY 
IS TRANSFERRED TO THE START OF A FOOD CHAIN 
IF ALL THE ENERGY THAT'S STORED IN THE PLANT 
AND IS AVAILABLE TO THE ANIMALS THAT EAT IT IS REPRESENTED BY THIS LIGHT 
HOW MUCH IS TRANSFERRED TO THAT ANIMAL 
NO THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY TRANSFERRED TO THE ANIMALS IS AROUND 
BUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE NINETY PER CENT THAT ISN'T 
IT'S NOT AVAILABLE TO THE FOOD CHAIN 
BECAUSE IT'S THE ENERGY THE PLANT NEEDS EVERY DAY TO SURVIVE 
AND IT'S THE ENERGY THAT DRIVES ALL THE REACTIONS TO MAKE NEW CELLS 
WHICH IN TURN PRODUCES LEAVES FLOWERS AND SEEDS 
IN FACT ALL LEVELS OF THE FOOD CHAIN 
ONLY TRANSFER TEN PER CENT OF THE ENERGY THEY RECEIVE ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL 
SO NINETY PER CENT OF ENERGY IS LOST FROM FOOD CHAINS 
BUT IT DOES KEEP EVERYTHING ALIVE 
HERE ARE SOME FACTS ABOUT FOOD CHAINS 
YOU NEED TO KNOW WELL TO ANSWER TEST QUESTIONS 
AND THE AMOUNT OF USABLE ENERGY DECREASES AS WE GO UP A FOOD CHAIN 
BECAUSE THE ENERGY TRANSFER IS VERY INEFFICIENT 
TO SUM UP FEEDING RELATIONSHIPS IN A HABITAT CAN BE SUMMARISED 
USING A FOOD WEB 
IF YOU WEREN'T SURE OF ANYTHING 
REWIND THE TAPE AND GO OVER THE KEY POINTS AGAIN 
POPULATION SIZE IS HOW MANY OF ONE TYPE 
OF PLANT OR ANIMAL THERE ARE IN A HABITAT 
BUT THE POPULATION OF A PARTICULAR ORGANISM DOESN'T JUST KEEP RISING 
SOMETIMES SOMETHING HAPPENS AND THE POPULATION 
GOES INTO FREE FALL AND STARTS DECLINING 
IN THE NEXT CLIP TRY AND NOTE DOWN 
BARN OWLS LIKE THIS ARE UNDER THREAT 
THEY'RE NOT PRODUCING ENOUGH YOUNG TO KEEP THE SPECIES GOING 
I'M HERE TO INVESTIGATE WHAT'S BEING DONE ABOUT IT 
SO WHY AREN'T BARN OWLS PRODUCING ENOUGH YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND THAT 
WE MUST LOOK AT THEIR FOOD CHAIN O. K. 
AT THE BOTTOM YOU'VE GOT GRASS EATEN BY SMALL MAMMALS VOLES AND MICE 
AND THEY'RE EATEN BY THE BARN OWLS 
IT'S THE NUMBER OF SMALL MAMMALS THAT'S IMPORTANT RIGHT 
THAT CONTROLS THE NUMBER OF OWLS THAT CAN LIVE IN A GIVEN AREA 
EXACTLY WHY IS THERE A SHORTAGE OF SMALL MAMMALS 
THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF GRASS 
IT'S NOT THE QUANTITY BUT THE QUALITY OF ROUGH GRASS THIS AREA IS SHORT 
CLOSE CROPPED AND VOLES CAN'T MAKE NESTS THEY CAN'T MAKE RUNS 
AND THEY CAN'T HIDE 
THIS GRASS IS TOO SHORT FOR SMALL MAMMALS TO LIVE IN 
SO THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FOOD FOR OWLS SO THE OWLS WON'T BREED 
AND THE SPECIES WILL DIE OUT 
SO THE OWLS NEED TO MOVE TO AN AREA WHERE HUNTING IS MORE EFFICIENT 
SOMEWHERE SUITABLE FOR SMALL MAMMALS 
YES I'LL SHOW YOU 
I GUESS THAT MEANS GRASSLAND THAT WOULD GIVE THEM GOOD COVER 
THIS MEADOW IS EXCELLENT 
THERE'S ROUGH TUSSOCKY GRASS HERE WHERE I'M SURE WE'LL FIND VOLE RUNS 
YES HERE WE ARE HERE'S A VOLE RUN 
AND IN HERE ARE THE SMALL CLIPPINGS OF GRASS WHICH IS THEIR FOOD STORE 
THIS AREA'S ALIVE WITH SMALL MAMMALS 
COLIN'S PUT AN OWL BOX HERE 
AS THERE ARE NO NATURAL NESTING PLACES IN THE AREA 
THESE ARE YOUNG OWLS SO THE PARENTS ARE BREEDING 
THEY'RE CHECKED TO MAKE SURE THEY'LL BE HEALTHY ADULTS 
IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE THEY FLY OFF FOR GOOD 
AND SOON THEY'LL START FAMILIES OF THEIR OWN TO CONTINUE THE SPECIES 
HAVE YOU NOTED THE TWO FACTORS AFFECTING THE BARN OWL POPULATION 
YOU SHOULD HAVE FOUND THAT 
THE OWL POPULATION IS DECREASING BECAUSE OF A LACK OF FOOD SUPPLY 
THE HABITAT OF THE SMALL MAMMALS THEY EAT IS DISAPPEARING 
WITH FEW SUITABLE NESTING PLACES ARTIFICIAL OWL BOXES WERE PUT UP 
THE SIZE OF A POPULATION IS CONTROLLED BY THREE MAJOR FACTORS 
ADAPTATION COMPETITION FROM OTHER SPECIES FOR FOOD WATER AND SHELTER 
AND PREDATION BEING EATEN BY ANIMALS FURTHER UP THE FOOD CHAIN 
A TIP ON REMEMBERING THESE IS TO DRAW A TRIANGLE 
AND PUT THE POPULATION SIZE IN THE MIDDLE 
THE THREE CONTROLLING FACTORS ARE ADDED TO THE SIDES 
PREDATORS TOO ARE AFFECTED BY THESE THINGS 
PARTICULARLY THEIR OWN FOOD SUPPLY THEIR PREY BUT HOW 
THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF A PREDATOR SLASH PREY CYCLE 
IF THE HARE POPULATION INCREASES 
THIS SUPPLIES MORE FOOD FOR THE LYNX THE PREDATOR 
THIS RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN THE LYNX POPULATION 
BUT MORE LYNX RESULTS IN LESS HARES 
WHICH IN TIME RESULTS IN LESS LYNX AGAIN 
THESE FLUCTUATING POPULATION SIZES 
ARE TYPICAL OF LOTS OF PREDATOR SLASH PREY RELATIONSHIPS 
THE POPULATION SIZE OF ANY SPECIES IS CONTROLLED BY THREE MAIN FACTORS 
HOW SUCCESSFUL SPECIES ARE 
IN COMPETING WITH OTHER SPECIES FOR THE SAME FOOD WATER OR SHELTER 
AND HOW MANY THERE ARE 
IN THE LAST SECTION WE SAW THIS FOOD WEB IN A TYPICAL BRITISH RIVER 
THE QUESTION IS 
THREE THINGS WILL HAPPEN SO THIS ANSWER CARRIES THREE MARKS 
WHY NOT PAUSE THE TAPE AND HAVE A THINK ABOUT IT 
IF MINNOWS WERE REMOVED FROM THIS FOOD WEB THREE THINGS WOULD HAPPEN 
THE RELATIONSHIPS IN THESE FOOD WEBS CAN GET QUITE COMPLICATED 
IF YOU WEREN'T SURE OF THE ANSWER GO OVER THIS SECTION AGAIN 
NOW LET'S FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TOXIC MATERIALS ENTER A FOOD WEB 
ANOTHER FACTOR THAT AFFECTS THE SIZE OF POPULATIONS 
IS THE ACTIVITY OF HUMANS 
EITHER BY PRODUCING POLLUTION 
OR LEAVING TOXIC SUBSTANCES IN THE ENVIRONMENT 
SOMETIMES THESE TOXIC SUBSTANCES GET INTO AND PASS ALONG A FOOD CHAIN 
PLANTS AND ANIMALS NEAR THE START OF A FOOD CHAIN ARE USUALLY UNHARMED 
BY THE RELATIVELY LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF THESE POISONS 
BUT AS SOME OF THESE CHEMICALS CAN'T BE EXCRETED 
AS THEY PASS ALONG THE CHAIN THEY BECOME MORE CONCENTRATED 
SO ANIMALS AT THE TOP TAKE IN AND RETAIN LARGE AMOUNTS OF THE POISON 
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO SOME ANIMALS AND BIRDS IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES 
AT THAT TIME SEEDS WERE OFTEN DIPPED IN PESTICIDE 
TO PROTECT THEM FROM PESTS 
BIRDS OF PREY LIKE PEREGRINE FALCONS AT THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN 
STARTED DYING OUT 
THEIR BODIES HAD LARGE AMOUNTS OF POISONOUS PESTICIDES 
ONE SIDE EFFECT WAS THAT NEWLY LAID EGGS HAD THIN SHELLS 
WHICH BROKE BEFORE THEY HATCHED 
NOW THESE PESTICIDES ARE BANNED 
AND PEREGRINE FALCONS ARE INCREASING IN NUMBERS AGAIN 
THIS BRINGS US TO THE END OF THIS FIRST BIOLOGY UNIT 
IF YOU WEREN'T SURE OF ANYTHING STOP AND GO BACK OVER IT AGAIN 
THIS NEXT UNIT LOOKS AT SPECIALISED ANIMAL AND PLANT CELLS FIRST 
THE SHAPE OF THE CELL AND ITS STRUCTURE DEPENDS ON ITS FUNCTION 
YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CELLS 
ARE ADAPTED TO THEIR JOB THEIR FUNCTION 
WE'LL LOOK AT TWO SPECIALISED ANIMAL CELLS 
SPERM CELLS AND CILIATED EPITHELIAL CELLS 
LET'S START WITH A SPERM CELL 
THE FUNCTION OF THE SPERM CELL 
IS TO CARRY THE MALE GENETIC INFORMATION TO THE OVUM 
AND BRING ABOUT FERTILISATION 
ONCE RELEASED THE SPERM MUST SWIM 
FROM THE VAGINA INTO THE FALLOPIAN TUBE WHERE IT MAY FUSE WITH AN OVUM 
THE STRUCTURE OF THE CELL IS HIGHLY SPECIALISED 
WITH A NUMBER OF ADAPTATIONS THAT MAKE IT GOOD AT WHAT IT DOES 
THE SPERM CELL HAS THREE ADAPTATIONS WHICH MAKE IT BETTER AT ITS JOB 
ONE IT HAS A TAIL THAT ENABLES IT TO SWIM ALONG 
TWO THE NUCLEUS CONTAINS ONLY HALF THE GENETIC INFORMATION 
THREE ENZYMES ON THE HEAD OF THE SPERM 
ENABLE IT TO DIGEST ITS WAY THROUGH THE OVUM MEMBRANE 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCES 
BETWEEN ADAPTATION AND FUNCTION 
A COMMON MISTAKE WHEN A QUESTION ASKS ABOUT HOW A CELL IS ADAPTED 
IS TO DESCRIBE ITS FUNCTION 
SO LET'S SORT OUT WHAT WE MEAN BY ADAPTATION AND FUNCTION 
WITH A SPERM CELL THIS WOULD BE A LONG TAIL FOR MOVEMENT 
AND HALF THE GENETIC INFORMATION 
THE JOB OF A SPERM CELL IS TO FERTILISE AN EGG 
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TYPE OF ANIMAL CELL 
IS THE CILIATED EPITHELIAL CELL 
THEY LINE ALL THE AIR PASSAGES FROM YOUR NOSE TO YOUR LUNGS 
CILIA ARE TINY HAIR LIKE STRUCTURES ON THE SURFACE OF THE CELL 
THE HAIRS SWEEP MUCUS TRAPPED DUST AND BACTERIA 
UP TO THE BACK OF THE THROAT WHERE IT CAN BE SWALLOWED 
THE CILIA BEAT TOGETHER TO MOVE THE LIQUID OR PARTICLES EFFICIENTLY 
CILIATED EPITHELIAL CELLS DON'T JUST APPEAR IN THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 
BUT ANYWHERE WHERE MATERIAL OR SUBSTANCES NEED TO BE MOVED ALONG 
SUCH CELLS WILL ALSO APPEAR IN THE DIGESTIVE AND REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS 
ON THE HIGHER TIER PAPER YOU COULD GET A QUESTION ON A SPECIALISED CELL 
YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY STUDIED 
A QUESTION DESIGNED TO SEE IF YOU CAN APPLY 
YOUR KNOWLEDGE TO A DIFFERENT SITUATION LET'S TRY ONE 
THIS IS A NERVE CELL 
CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW IT'S ADAPTED TO ITS FUNCTION 
THEY'VE ASKED YOU TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING 
SO LINK YOUR DESCRIPTION OF THE ADAPTATION 
WITH YOUR EXPLANATION OF HOW THAT HELPS THE CELL DO ITS JOB 
LOOK AT THE DIAGRAM AND WORK OUT HOW THIS CELL IS SUITED TO ITS JOB 
YOU COULD HAVE SAID THAT 
THE NEXT SECTION IN THIS UNIT LOOKS AT SPECIALISED PLANT CELLS 
LIKE ANIMAL CELLS PLANT CELLS HAVE A NUCLEUS 
CYTOPLASM AND A CELL MEMBRANE 
THEY ALSO HAVE THREE OTHER STRUCTURES 
THE CELL WALL MADE UP OF CELLULOSE 
A LARGE VACUOLE AND CHLOROPLASTS FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
NOT ALL PLANT CELLS HAVE CHLOROPLASTS 
IN THIS FIRST SPECIALISED PLANT CELL 
THERE IS NO NEED FOR CHLOROPLASTS 
AS THESE CELLS LIVE UNDERGROUND AND FORM THE ROOTS 
HERE'S A CROSS SECTION OF A PLANT'S ROOT 
THE ROOT HAIR CELL HAS A LONG HAIR LIKE STRUCTURE 
THAT COMES OUT FROM THE BODY OF THE CELL 
THIS INCREASES ITS SURFACE AREA 
AND ENABLES THE EFFICIENT UPTAKE OF WATER AND MINERALS 
THERE IS NO OUTER WAXY LAYER 
THE THIN CELL WALL ALLOWS FOR QUICKER UPTAKE OF WATER 
AND NO CHLOROPLASTS ARE FOUND 
BEING UNDERGROUND THERE IS NO LIGHT FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
AT THE OPPOSITE END OF A PLANT 
THE PALISADE CELLS CAN BE FOUND IN THE UPPER PART OF ALL LEAVES 
THEIR FUNCTION IS TO ENABLE PHOTOSYNTHESIS TO BE CARRIED OUT 
AND THEY HAVE SEVERAL ADAPTATIONS YOU NEED TO BE FAMILIAR WITH 
PALISADE CELLS HAVE A LARGE SURFACE AREA 
FOR THE ABSORPTION OF CARBON DIOXIDE AND LIGHT 
THEY ARE PACKED WITH CHLOROPLASTS 
WHICH ARE NEARER TO THE LEAF'S SURFACE WHICH FACES THE SUN 
SO MORE CHLOROPLASTS ARE EXPOSED TO A HIGH LIGHT INTENSITY 
LET'S GO OVER THE MAIN FUNCTIONS AND ADAPTATIONS 
OF ROOT HAIR AND PALISADE CELLS 
THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF THIS UNIT ON SPECIALISED CELLS 
CAN YOU REMEMBER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ADAPTATION AND FUNCTION 
IF YOU'RE UNSURE REWIND AND CHECK OUT THE KEY POINTS AGAIN 
IF YOU'RE HAPPY WITH THIS UNIT THIS IS A GOOD POINT TO TAKE A BREAK 
THE FINAL SECTION OF BIOLOGY LOOKS AT LIFE PROCESSES 
WE'LL KICK OFF WITH PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
LET'S JUST REMIND OURSELVES ABOUT PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
IT IS THE PROCESS WHERE GREEN PLANTS MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD 
USING ENERGY FROM THE SUN IN THE PRESENCE OF CHLOROPHYLL 
WATCH THIS CLIP AND WRITE DOWN THE FOUR COMPONENTS NEEDED 
ALL GREEN PLANTS NEED SUNLIGHT TO MAKE THEIR OWN FOOD 
THE PROCESS IS CALLED PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
PHOTOSYNTHESIS HAPPENS IN THE LEAVES 
THEY CONTAIN A SPECIAL GREEN PIGMENT CALLED CHLOROPHYLL 
WHICH TRAPS SUNLIGHT 
THE LEAF IN ALL ITS SHAPES AND SIZES IS ACTUALLY A FOOD FACTORY 
IN PHOTOSYNTHESIS IT TAKES RAW MATERIALS FROM THE ENVIRONMENT 
AND USES THEM WITH SUNLIGHT TO PRODUCE SUGAR WHICH IT USES TO GROW 
PHOTOSYNTHESIS CAN BE DESCRIBED BY AN EQUATION 
WITH THE SUN'S ENERGY 
PRODUCES OXYGEN AND SUGAR 
AT NIGHTFALL WITH NO SUNLIGHT PLANTS CAN'T PHOTOSYNTHESISE 
BUT AS THE SUN RISES THE FOOD FACTORIES ARE BACK TO WORK AGAIN 
YOU SHOULD HAVE COME UP WITH FOUR THINGS NEEDED FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER THE RAW INGREDIENTS 
SUNLIGHT WHICH PROVIDES THE ENERGY 
AND CHLOROPHYLL IN THE LEAVES 
WHICH ACTS AS A CATALYST FOR THE REACTION 
TOGETHER THESE MAKE GLUCOSE A SIMPLE SUGAR 
OXYGEN GAS IS ALSO GIVEN OFF 
A BY PRODUCT OF THE REACTION BUT ESSENTIAL FOR LIFE ON THIS PLANET 
SEE IF YOU CAN WRITE OUT THE WORD EQUATION FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
REMEMBER THAT YOU NEED TO WRITE GLUCOSE NOT SIMPLY SUGAR 
YOUR WORD EQUATION SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS 
CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER IN THE PRESENCE OF SUNLIGHT AND CHLOROPHYLL 
PRODUCE GLUCOSE AND OXYGEN 
PHOTOSYNTHESIS DOESN'T JUST OCCUR ON LAND BUT ALSO IN WATER 
IN THE NEXT CLIP WHAT IS STELLA TESTING FOR AND WHY 
THE OXYGEN LEVEL DOWN HERE IS GETTING A BIT LOW 
AT LEAST MY NEW PLANTS WILL HELP ME THERE 
GREEN PLANTS ARE VITAL IN MAINTAINING THE OXYGEN LEVEL EVERYWHERE ON EARTH 
OXYGEN WE ALL NEED TO BREATHE 
WHEN PLANTS PHOTOSYNTHESISE 
THEY USE UP CARBON DIOXIDE AND PRODUCE OXYGEN 
THIS IS VITAL FOR ALL US ANIMALS ON LAND AND SEA 
INCLUDING MY GOLDFISH CARROT 
LOOK CLOSELY AT THE POND WEED 
YOU SEE TINY BUBBLES OF GAS PRODUCED BY THE LEAVES 
THIS TEST TUBE HAS BEEN COLLECTING GAS FOR A FEW HOURS 
LOOKS LIKE OXYGEN TO ME 
THE POND WEED HAS BEEN PHOTOSYNTHESISING THIS TIME 
TAKING IN DISSOLVED CARBON DIOXIDE AND IN THE PRESENCE OF SUNLIGHT 
PRODUCING GLUCOSE AND THAT VITAL OXYGEN AS TINY GAS BUBBLES 
OF COURSE WITHOUT SUNLIGHT PHOTOSYNTHESIS WILL STOP 
HERE ARE THE KEY POINTS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
ESSENTIAL FOR THE PLANET 
CAN YOU REMEMBER THE WORD EQUATION FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
IF NOT REWIND AND GO OVER THIS SECTION AGAIN 
OR MOVE ON TO THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE LEAF 
TO MAKE PHOTOSYNTHESIS HAPPEN YOU NEED THESE GREEN LEAVES 
THESE ARE THE FOOD FACTORIES THAT PRODUCE GLUCOSE 
LEAVES ARE WELL ADAPTED FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
THEY HAVE A LARGE SURFACE AREA 
TO ABSORB THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT UNDER A MICROSCOPE 
WE CAN SEE THAT THE LEAF HAS MANY TINY HOLES ALL OVER THE SURFACE 
WHICH ARE CALLED STOMATA 
THESE ARE SPECIALISED STRUCTURES ALLOWING FOR THE EXCHANGE OF GASES 
CARBON DIOXIDE TO PASS IN AND OXYGEN TO PASS OUT DURING THE DAY 
VEINS WHICH YOU CAN SEE HERE CARRY WATER INTO THE LEAF FROM THE ROOTS 
AND IF WE GO BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE LEAF 
WE CAN SEE THE PALISADE CELLS WHICH ARE PACKED WITH CHLOROPLASTS 
THE CHLOROPLASTS CONTAIN THE GREEN PIGMENT CHLOROPHYLL 
WHICH ABSORBS THE SUNLIGHT AND MAKES IT AVAILABLE FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
IF YOU WEREN'T SURE OF ANYTHING STOP AND GO BACK 
BEFORE MOVING ON TO OUR NEXT TOPIC 
THE THIRD SECTION LOOKS AT RESPIRATION 
WE GET ENERGY FROM FOOD BY RESPIRATION 
THE PROCESS WHERE A SUPPLY OF OXYGEN RELEASES ENERGY FROM OUR FOOD 
RESPIRATION IS A CHEMICAL REACTION 
WHICH RELEASES READILY AVAILABLE ENERGY FOR EVERYTHING WE DO 
WHETHER YOU'RE PLAYING SPORTS WALKING 
OR EVEN JUST SITTING AROUND YOU'RE USING ENERGY 
YOUR BODY NEEDS ENERGY FOR GROWTH MOVEMENT AND TO REPAIR CELLS 
IN FACT THE SAME IS TRUE OF ALL LIVING THINGS INCLUDING PLANTS 
THIS ENERGY IS LOCKED IN GLUCOSE WHICH COMES FROM THE FOOD WE EAT 
AND WHICH PLANTS MAKE THEMSELVES 
IT'S STORED IN THE CELLS OF THE BODY 
THE ENERGY LOCKED INTO THE GLUCOSE IS USUALLY RELEASED BY USING OXYGEN 
BREATHING IS THE FIRST STEP 
IN GETTING OXYGEN TO THE CELLS FOR RESPIRATION 
BY BREATHING IN WE TAKE THE AIR INTO OUR LUNGS 
FROM WHERE OXYGEN IS TRANSPORTED BY BLOOD TO THE CELLS 
FOR US BREATHING IS AN IMPORTANT WAY OF GETTING OXYGEN INTO OUR LUNGS 
BUT IT MUSTN'T BE CONFUSED WITH THE PROCESS OF RESPIRATION 
THE AIR ENTERS THE LUNGS ONCE THIS SHEET OF MUSCLE 
THE DIAPHRAGM IS CONTRACTED AND BECOMES FLATTER 
AND THESE MUSCLES IN BETWEEN THE RIBS 
HAVE RAISED THE CHEST UP AND OUT 
THE AIR FLOWING IN IS COLDER AND DRIER THAN THE AIR EXHALED 
IT ALSO CONTAINS MORE OXYGEN AND LESS CARBON DIOXIDE 
THE INHALED AIR TRAVELS DOWN THE WINDPIPE 
AND VIA THE SMALLER TUBES 
EVENTUALLY REACHES THESE TINY AIR SACS CALLED ALVEOLI 
EACH ALVEOLUS IS SO TINY THAT A GRAIN OF SALT WOULD MORE THAN FILL IT 
THEY GIVE THE LUNGS A LARGE SURFACE AREA 
HAVE A GOOD BLOOD SUPPLY AND VERY THIN MOIST WALLS 
IDEAL CONDITIONS FOR THE EXCHANGE OF GASES 
THEY ALLOW OXYGEN TO PASS INTO THE BLOOD 
AND CARBON DIOXIDE TO PASS OUT OF IT 
ALL THE ALVEOLI PUT TOGETHER HAVE A HUGE SURFACE AREA 
ABOUT FORTY TIMES THAT OF THE SKIN 
THIS ENABLES LARGE AMOUNTS OF OXYGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE 
TO PASS INTO OR OUT OF THE BODY EFFICIENTLY 
WE ALL HAVE MILES AND MILES OF BLOOD VESSELS IN OUR BODIES 
BLOOD LOADED WITH OXYGEN IS CARRIED FROM THE LUNGS TO THE HEART 
THE HEART THEN PUMPS THE BLOOD AROUND THE BODY IN THE ARTERIES 
THE ARTERIES DIVIDE INTO VERY THIN VESSELS CALLED CAPILLARIES 
THAT CARRY THIS OXYGEN RICH BLOOD TO OUR CELLS WHERE RESPIRATION OCCURS 
BLOOD NOW HIGH IN CARBON DIOXIDE 
IS CARRIED IN VEINS BACK TO THE LUNGS VIA THE HEART 
WHEN OXYGEN IS USED IN RESPIRATION 
IN SOME WAYS IT IS SIMILAR TO BURNING 
OXYGEN COMBINES WITH FOOD SUBSTANCES THE FUEL TO RELEASE ENERGY AS HEAT 
BUT BURNING HAPPENS VERY QUICKLY WITH A SUDDEN BURST OF ENERGY 
WITH RESPIRATION HOWEVER 
ENERGY IS RELEASED IN A CONTROLLED WAY AS AND WHEN WE NEED IT 
THROUGH A SERIES OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS IN THE CELLS 
THE ENERGY VALUES OF ALL FOODS INCLUDING BISCUITS 
CAN BE MEASURED IN TERMS OF KILOJOULES 
MOST FOOD PACKETS WILL SAY HOW MANY KILOJOULES THERE ARE IN ONE HUNDRED GRAMS 
THIS PACKET OF BISCUITS HAS ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN KILOJOULES PER ONE HUNDRED GRAMS 
AFTER DIGESTION THE BISCUIT IS BROKEN DOWN INTO THE SIMPLEST UNITS 
USUALLY GLUCOSE A SIMPLE SUGAR 
SO GLUCOSE AND OXYGEN ARE THE INGREDIENTS NEEDED FOR RESPIRATION 
AND WE CAN SUM UP THE PROCESS IN A WORD EQUATION 
GLUCOSE REACTS WITH OXYGEN 
TO PRODUCE CARBON DIOXIDE WATER AND ENERGY 
STOP THE TAPE AND PRACTISE WRITING IT TILL YOU KNOW IT OFF BY HEART 
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF FACTS YOU NEED TO GET STRAIGHT ABOUT RESPIRATION 
RESPIRATION IS OFTEN CONFUSED WITH BREATHING 
REMEMBER RESPIRATION IS A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT RELEASES ENERGY 
BREATHING IS A PHYSICAL PROCESS USING LUNGS 
THAT BIRDS AND MAMMALS USE TO TAKE IN OXYGEN 
SECONDLY IT'S NOT OBVIOUS THAT RESPIRATION TAKES PLACE IN PLANTS 
YOU CAN'T SEE THEM TAKING IN OXYGEN BUT THE NEXT CLIP LOOKS AT 
A RISE IN TEMPERATURE TO SHOW THAT PLANTS RESPIRE 
THIS EXPERIMENT SHOWS 
HOW PLANTS RELEASE ENERGY IN RESPIRATION AS HEAT 
IN THIS CONTAINER IS WELL SOAKED GERMINATING WHEAT 
THE OTHER CONTAINER IS A CONTROL 
IT CONTAINS THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER BUT IS FULL OF DEAD WHEAT 
THE THERMOMETERS SHOW THE LIVE WHEAT IS A LOT WARMER THAN THE DEAD WHEAT 
RESPIRATION IS SLOWLY RELEASING ENERGY AS HEAT 
PLANTS PHOTOSYNTHESISE BUT THEY STILL NEED TO RESPIRE 
PLANTS PRODUCE BIOMASS BUT THEY ALSO NEED TO UNLOCK THE ENERGY AGAIN 
FOR GROWING REPRODUCING REPAIRING DAMAGED CELLS AND SO ON 
IN FACT THE CELLS OF EVERY ANIMAL AND PLANT RESPIRE 
THAT IS TAKE IN OXYGEN 
TO RELEASE ENERGY FROM GLUCOSE 
SO REMEMBER PLANTS BOTH PHOTOSYNTHESISE AND RESPIRE 
WHICH IS PHYSICALLY TAKING AIR INTO OUR LUNGS 
THE HIGHER TIER PAPER SOMETIMES ASKS YOU 
TO APPLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT 
LET'S TRY AN EXAMPLE 
HERE'S A QUESTION THAT LOOKS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CARBON DIOXIDE 
THE QUESTION LOOKS COMPLICATED WITH LO T. S. OF FACTS 
SO WE'LL GO THROUGH IT STEP BY STEP 
FIRST WE'RE GIVEN A TABLE WHICH CONTAINS INFORMATION 
ABOUT HOW HYDROGEN CARBONATE INDICATOR SOLUTION CHANGES COLOUR 
IN DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF DISSOLVED CARBON DIOXIDE 
SO THAT'S THE TABLE OF INFORMATION NOW YOU NEED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION 
ON THE PAPER THERE'S A PICTURE OF SOME TEST TUBES 
HERE ARE SOME TEST TUBES CONTAINING HYDROGEN CARBONATE INDICATOR 
TEST TUBE A CONTAINS SMALL SNAILS 
TEST TUBE B. CONTAINS WATERWEED 
C. CONTAINS SNAILS AND WATERWEED 
AND D. IS THE CONTROL WITH ONLY THE SOLUTION 
AT THE START OF THE EXPERIMENT THEY ARE ALL REDDISH ORANGE 
SO THEY CONTAIN THE SAME AMOUNT OF CARBON DIOXIDE AS IN THE AIR 
THE QUESTION IS 
WE MUST EXAMINE EACH TEST TUBE THINK ABOUT WHAT'S INSIDE IT 
AND GO BACK TO OUR CHART 
TO CHECK WHAT COLOUR THE INDICATOR SOLUTION WILL HAVE CHANGED TO 
HOW HAVE OUR TEST TUBES WITH THE HYDROGEN CARBONATE INDICATOR 
CHANGED AFTER TWO HOURS 
IN A CONTAINING THE SMALL SNAILS THE COLOUR IS YELLOW 
THERE WILL BE MORE CARBON DIOXIDE THAN IN THE AIR 
AS THE SNAILS WILL HAVE BEEN CARRYING OUT RESPIRATION 
IN B. CONTAINING THE WATERWEED THE TEST TUBE COLOUR IS PURPLE 
SHOWING THERE IS LESS CARBON DIOXIDE 
AS THE PLANT IS PHOTOSYNTHESISING AND USING UP THE CARBON DIOXIDE 
IN C. CONTAINING PLANTS AND SNAILS THE REDDISH ORANGE STAYS THE SAME 
BECAUSE OF BOTH RESPIRATION AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
KEEPING THE LEVELS OF CARBON DIOXIDE MORE OR LESS EQUAL 
D. THE CONTROL STAYS THE SAME 
WE'VE USED THE CHART TO WORK OUT OUR ANSWERS IF YOU WEREN'T SURE 
RUN THE SECTIONS ON PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND RESPIRATION AGAIN 
PREPARE ALL EQUIPMENT WELL BEFORE THE EXAM LIKE PENS PENCILS RULERS 
DON'T LEAVE EVERYTHING TO THE LAST MINUTE 
THIS BRINGS US TO THE END OF THE BIOLOGY SECTION IN THIS PROGRAMME 
REMEMBER TO PACE YOURSELF AND DO YOUR REVISION IN BITESIZE CHUNKS 
THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO TAKE A BREAK 
THE NEXT SECTION IS ABOUT CHEMISTRY 
IT'S DIVIDED INTO ELEMENTS COMPOUNDS AND MIXTURES 
CHEMICAL REACTIONS WEATHERING AND THE PARTICLE MODEL 
WE'LL START WITH ELEMENTS COMPOUNDS AND MIXTURES 
TO START WITH WE'LL LOOK AT ELEMENTS 
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNISE ELEMENTS COMPOUNDS AND MIXTURES 
FROM THEIR STRUCTURES AND FROM THEIR SYMBOLS OR FORMULAE 
WE'RE GOING TO RUN THROUGH THE MOST COMMON ELEMENTS AND COMPOUNDS 
FIRST OF ALL ELEMENTS 
ELEMENTS CAN'T BE SPLIT UP INTO ANYTHING SIMPLER 
THEY EACH CONTAIN ONLY ONE TYPE OF PARTICLE CALLED ATOMS 
EVERYTHING ON EARTH IS MADE UP OF ELEMENTS 
THERE ARE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWELVE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS 
EACH ONE IS MADE UP OF ONE TYPE OF ATOM 
BUT THE ATOMS OF OXYGEN WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM THE ATOMS OF GOLD 
WHICH AGAIN ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE ATOMS OF SULPHUR 
EACH ELEMENT HAS A NAME AND A SHORTHAND SYMBOL TO IDENTIFY IT 
YOU NEED TO KNOW THE SYMBOLS OF THE TWENTY MOST COMMON ELEMENTS 
WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS THERE ARE SIMPLE RULES FOR ELEMENTS' SYMBOLS 
LET'S SPLIT THEM UP INTO METALS AND NON METALS 
SO THE METAL MAGNESIUM TAKES THE TWO LETTERS FROM ITS NAME MG 
THE FIRST LETTER IS ALWAYS A CAPITAL AND THE SECOND IS LOWER CASE 
ALUMINIUM IS AL 
CALCIUM WHICH NATURALLY OCCURS IN MILK IS C. A. 
ZINC HAS ITS FIRST AND THIRD LETTERS TO MAKE ZN 
THE OTHERS ARE MORE TRICKY BECAUSE SOME ARE DERIVED FROM LATIN NAMES 
LEAD HAS THE LETTERS PB FROM THE WORD PLUMBUM 
THAT'S WHERE WE GET PLUMBER FROM AS THEY USED TO USE LEAD PIPES 
SILVER HAS THE LETTERS AG FROM THE LATIN WORD ARGENTUM 
SIMILAR TO GOLD AU IS FROM AURUM 
REMEMBER THE FIRST LETTER IS ALWAYS A CAPITAL 
AND THE SECOND A LOWER CASE LETTER 
YOU ALSO NEED TO KNOW THE MOST COMMON NON METALS 
ALMOST ALWAYS THE FIRST LETTER CORRESPONDS 
WITH THE NAME OF THE ELEMENT LET'S RUN THROUGH THEM 
FIRST THE GASES THEY'RE H. FOR HYDROGEN 
O. FOR OXYGEN 
N. FOR NITROGEN WHICH IS THE MAIN COMPONENT OF FERTILISERS 
CL FOR CHLORINE USED IN DISINFECTANTS 
HE FOR HELIUM 
NOW THE SOLIDS S. FOR SULPHUR 
NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH SI FOR SILICON 
AND FINALLY C. FOR CARBON 
IF YOU'RE NOT SURE OF ANY OF THEM 
WHY NOT REWIND AND GO THROUGH THEM AGAIN MAKING A NOTE AS YOU GO 
AN ELEMENT IS MADE OF JUST ONE TYPE OF ATOM SUCH AS CARBON OR GOLD 
BUT OTHER ELEMENTS SUCH AS OXYGEN OR HYDROGEN 
EXIST AS MOLECULES 
WHEN ATOMS ARE JOINED TOGETHER THEY ARE CALLED MOLECULES 
BUT THEY ARE STILL MADE UP OF ONLY ONE TYPE OF ATOM 
THIS IS OXYGEN GAS 
TWO ATOMS OF OXYGEN JOINED TOGETHER WHICH MAKES IT A MOLECULE 
THIS IS CARBON JUST ONE ATOM 
AND THIS IS THE GAS HYDROGEN 
WHICH LIKE OXYGEN HAS TWO ATOMS JOINED TOGETHER SO IT'S A MOLECULE 
YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT ELEMENTS ARE PURE SUBSTANCES 
NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO LOOK AT COMPOUNDS AND MIXTURES 
COMPOUNDS ARE MADE UP OF TWO OR MORE ELEMENTS JOINED TOGETHER 
TO MAKE A COMPOUND THE ATOMS MUST BE 
FROM DIFFERENT ELEMENTS WHICH JOIN TO FORM A CHEMICAL BOND 
THE SMALLEST PART OF A COMPOUND THAT CAN EXIST IS A MOLECULE 
LET'S LOOK AT A COMMON MOLECULE 
HERE'S A VERY FAMILIAR COMPOUND WATER 
THIS APPARATUS USES ELECTRICITY TO RELEASE THE ELEMENTS 
WHICH MAKE UP WATER 
BUBBLES OF GAS ARE RELEASED FROM TWO ELECTRODES OXYGEN FROM THIS ONE 
AND BIG HYDROGEN BUBBLES FROM HERE 
THE OXYGEN AND HYDROGEN COLLECT IN THE TOP OF THE TUBES 
BUT LOOK THERE'S TWICE AS MUCH HYDROGEN AS OXYGEN 
WHY 
WHEN PARTICLES JOIN TOGETHER IN A COMPOUND 
THEY CLING TOGETHER VERY FIRMLY 
THE COMBINATIONS ARE CALLED MOLECULES 
THE PARTICLES CAN ONLY JOIN TOGETHER IN SPECIFIC COMBINATIONS 
IN WATER'S CASE IT'S TWO HYDROGEN PARTICLES FOR EVERY OXYGEN PARTICLE 
NO EXTRAS ARE ALLOWED 
ALL MOLECULES IN A COMPOUND ARE THE SAME 
LIKE ELEMENTS COMPOUNDS ALSO HAVE SYMBOLS TO REPRESENT THEM 
CALLED CHEMICAL FORMULAE 
SO WATER HAS THE CHEMICAL FORMULA H. TWO O. 
THIS TELLS US THAT IT CONTAINS HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN ATOMS 
AND THAT THERE ARE TWO HYDROGEN ATOMS FOR EVERY ONE OXYGEN ATOM 
THE OXYGEN ATOM DOESN'T HAVE A NUMBER AFTER IT AS THERE'S ONLY ONE 
CARBON DIOXIDE IS WRITTEN C. O. TWO 
TWO OXYGEN ATOMS TO EVERY ONE CARBON 
IF YOU'RE WRITING THESE 
WRITE THEM ACCURATELY WITH A TWO SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE LETTERS 
A COMPOUND IS A SUBSTANCE MADE UP OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF ELEMENTS 
CHEMICALLY JOINED TOGETHER 
BESIDES ELEMENTS AND COMPOUNDS YOU ALSO NEED TO KNOW ABOUT MIXTURES 
MIXTURES ARE SUBSTANCES THAT ARE NOT CHEMICALLY JOINED UP 
AND CAN BE EASILY SEPARATED 
AIR IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A MIXTURE IT'S MADE UP OF SEVERAL GASES 
SO IS ORDINARY TAP WATER WHICH HAS MINERALS DISSOLVED IN IT 
ORANGE JUICE SEA WATER AND CRUDE OIL ARE OTHER MIXTURES 
WHERE THE DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES CAN BE SEPARATED OUT 
WHEN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING 
MAKE SURE YOU MAKE SENSE OF IT AT THE TIME 
INSTEAD OF LEAVING IT TILL THE EXAM 
FOR THE HIGHER TEST PAPERS YOU NEED TO KNOW 
THE CHEMICAL FORMULAE FOR COMMONLY USED COMPOUNDS 
THERE ARE TWO USEFUL RULES FOR NAMING COMPOUNDS 
SODIUM CHLORIDE IS COMMON SALT 
A PARTICULAR PROBLEM IS MIXING UP IDES AND ATES REMEMBER 
STOP HERE AND HAVE A THINK ABOUT WHAT THESE REPRESENT 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE CHEMICAL FORMULAE 
HERE ARE SOME KEY POINTS TO HELP YOU REMEMBER THE RULES 
NEXT THE PERIODIC TABLE 
THE HUNDRED OR SO ELEMENTS WE KNOW ABOUT CAN BE PUT INTO A TABLE FORM 
WHICH WE CALL THE PERIODIC TABLE 
THIS SHOWS ALL THE ELEMENTS THAT EXIST 
USING THEIR SYMBOL TO REPRESENT EACH ONE 
YOU DON'T NEED TO LEARN ALL OF THIS OFF BY HEART 
BUT YOU NEED TO BE FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF ITS FEATURES 
THE PERIODIC TABLE IS ORGANISED SO THAT THE ELEMENTS BELONG 
TO CERTAIN CHEMICAL FAMILIES 
THESE HAVE SIMILAR PROPERTIES AND THEY ARE SHOWN CLOSE TO EACH OTHER 
THE MAIN ONES YOU NEED TO KNOW ARE THE METALS ON THE LEFT 
AND THE NON METALS ON THE RIGHT 
A ZIGZAG LINE DIVIDES THE TWO GROUPS UP 
SECONDLY THE MOST REACTIVE METALS 
SUCH AS LITHIUM SODIUM AND POTASSIUM 
ARE ON THE FAR LEFT 
AS WE GO TO THE CENTRE OF THE TABLE 
THE METALS ARE LESS REACTIVE 
FOR KEY STAGE THREE YOU DON'T NEED TO LEARN ALL THIS 
IF THE PERIODIC TABLE COMES UP YOU WILL BE GIVEN A COPY ON THE PAPER 
WE'RE NOW GOING TO LOOK AT CHEMICAL REACTIONS 
FIRST OFF THE REACTIVITY SERIES 
FOR THE HIGHER TIER PAPERS 
YOU MUST KNOW THE REACTIVITY SERIES OF METALS WELL 
AND REMEMBER THE ORDER THE METALS APPEAR IN 
AT THE TOP WE HAVE THE MOST REACTIVE METALS 
THESE METALS PARTICULARLY THE TOP THREE ARE VERY REACTIVE 
AS WE GO DOWN THE TABLE 
THE MIDDLE GROUP OF METALS ARE ZINC IRON TIN LEAD AND COPPER 
WHICH ARE LESS REACTIVE 
AND RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE REACTIVITY TABLE 
ARE SILVER AND GOLD 
THESE ARE VERY UNREACTIVE 
WHICH IS WHY WE USE THEM FOR JEWELLERY CUTLERY AND FILLINGS 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE ORDER OF THESE METALS 
TO PREDICT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN CHEMICAL REACTIONS 
I REMEMBER THE REACTIVITY SERIES BY A LITTLE RHYME 
POP STARS CAN MAKE ABSOLUTE ZILLIONS 
IF LITTLE CHILDREN SPEND GENEROUSLY 
ONCE WE KNOW THE ORDER OF REACTIVITY WE CAN START 
TO PREDICT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN A REACTION 
LET'S LOOK AT ANOTHER EXPERIMENT 
THIS TIME WE TAKE POWDERED COPPER OXIDE WHICH LOOKS REDDISH BROWN 
AND ADD THE METAL MAGNESIUM WHICH HAS BEEN GROUND UP INTO A POWDER 
AFTER MIXING THE TWO WE NEED SOME HEAT TO GET THINGS GOING 
BUT ONCE STARTED THE REACTION IS VERY DRAMATIC 
THIS TYPE OF REACTION IS CALLED A DISPLACEMENT REACTION 
DISPLACEMENT LITERALLY MEANS TAKING THE PLACE OF 
THERE'S AN IMPORTANT RULE TO HELP YOU 
COPPER IS LOWER THAN MAGNESIUM IN THE REACTIVITY SERIES 
SO MAGNESIUM IS THE MORE REACTIVE METAL 
HERE THE MAGNESIUM DISPLACES TAKES THE PLACE OF COPPER 
TO BECOME MAGNESIUM OXIDE 
WE CAN WRITE A WORD EQUATION FOR THE REACTION 
ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT A DISPLACEMENT REACTION 
IS USING A DIAGRAM 
IN THIS CASE IF WE TAKE IRON AND COPPER SULPHATE 
THE IRON WILL PUSH THE COPPER OUT AND IT TAKES UP THE SULPHATE 
WE SAY THE COPPER IS DISPLACED AND WILL APPEAR AS A METAL DEPOSIT 
WE CAN WRITE A WORD EQUATION FOR THE REACTION 
WE'VE SET UP AN EXPERIMENT WITH A SOLUTION OF IRON NITRATE 
AND ADDED THE METAL COPPER TO IT 
IN ANOTHER TEST TUBE WE'VE TAKEN SILVER NITRATE AND ADDED COPPER 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND WHY 
THESE ARE DISPLACEMENT REACTIONS 
PUT THE COPPER IN O. K. 
PUT IN THE IRON NITRATE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS YEAH 
WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GONNA HAPPEN 
NOW PART TWO 
SHALL WE GO ON ALL RIGHT PUT IN THE COPPER THEN SOME SILVER NITRATE 
SO THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST PART 
THERE WON'T BE ANY REACTION COS THE IRON NITRATE 
IS HIGHER IN THE REACTIVITY SERIES THAN COPPER 
THERE WON'T BE ANY DISPLACEMENT 
THE SECOND MARK FOR QUESTION ONE IS FOR SAYING 
BECAUSE IRON IS MORE REACTIVE THAN COPPER 
THE SECOND MARK FOR QUESTION TWO IS FOR SAYING 
BECAUSE SILVER IS LESS REACTIVE THAN COPPER 
THERE'LL DEFINITELY BE SOME CHANGE THE COLOUR'S GOING ALREADY OH YES 
COPPER IS HIGHER IN THE REACTIVITY SERIES THAN SILVER 
SO IT WILL DISPLACE 
YOU CAN TELL THERE'S BEEN A CHEMICAL REACTION IT'S CHANGING COLOUR 
IT'S GONE BLUE THAT MUST BE THE COPPER NITRATE 
THE METAL COPPER HAS DISPLACED THE SILVER 
WHICH IS DEPOSITED ON THE SURFACE 
THE BLUE COLOUR IS THE COPPER NITRATE THIS IS THE WORD EQUATION 
THE SECOND MARK FOR THE FIRST QUESTION IS AWARDED FOR SAYING 
THE SECOND MARK FOR THE SECOND QUESTION IS FOR SAYING 
THAT'S THE END OF THIS UNIT ON CHEMICAL REACTIONS 
IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO TAKE A BREAK 
UNIT SIX LOOKS AT WEATHERING 
THIS SUBJECT IS SPLIT INTO PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL WEATHERING 
WEATHERING IS THE PROCESS WHERE ROCKS 
AND ARTIFICIAL STRUCTURES ARE WORN AWAY 
AND BROKEN DOWN INTO SMALLER PIECES 
THIS IS DUE TO EITHER PHYSICAL OR CHEMICAL PROCESSES 
THIS SECTION LOOKS AT THE PHYSICAL PROCESS OF WEATHERING 
AND THE NEXT SECTION THE CHEMICAL PROCESS 
THE MAIN CAUSE OF PHYSICAL WEATHERING IS WATER FALLING AS RAIN 
HOW DOES RAIN BREAK DOWN MATERIALS 
RAINWATER GETS IN THE CRACKS IN A ROCK AND TO SHOW YOU WHAT HAPPENS 
I'VE FILLED THIS IRON FLASK WITH WATER AND I'M GOING TO PUT IT IN ICE 
RAINWATER GETS INTO THE CRACKS AND FREEZES 
THE ICE EXPANDS AS IT FORMS 
AND THE FORCE IS LARGE ENOUGH TO SPLIT THE ROCK 
EVENTUALLY 
THE ROCK HAS SO MANY CRACKS 
THIS HAS BEEN VERY WELL WEATHERED 
EASY 
WATER'S THE ONLY SUBSTANCE THAT DOES NOT CONTRACT WHEN IT FREEZES SOLID 
SO ROCKS ARE BROKEN AND SPLIT APART 
BY WATER REPEATEDLY FREEZING IN THE CRACKS AND EXPANDING 
THE ROCK IS WEAKENED AND PIECES BREAK OFF 
THIS PROCESS IS CALLED 
THE OTHER TYPE OF PHYSICAL WEATHERING IS THE EFFECT OF THE SUN 
IN VERY HOT PLACES DURING THE DAY ROCKS WARM UP AND EXPAND 
AND AT NIGHT THEY COOL DOWN AND CONTRACT 
OVER MANY YEARS THIS CAUSES THE ROCKS 
TO CRACK AND BREAK INTO SMALLER PIECES 
THIS IS CALLED 
ALTERNATE FREEZING AND THAWING OF WATER 
AND THE CONTRACTION AND EXPANSION OF ROCKS 
ARE BOTH EXAMPLES OF PHYSICAL WEATHERING 
LET'S GO ON TO LOOK AT CHEMICAL WEATHERING 
CHEMICAL WEATHERING IS DIFFERENT FROM PHYSICAL WEATHERING 
AS IT ISN'T A MECHANICAL PROCESS 
IT'S CARRIED OUT BY CHEMICALS IN THE AIR OR DISSOLVED IN RAINWATER 
ALL RAIN IS SLIGHTLY ACIDIC 
AND WHEN IT FALLS ON MATERIALS LIKE THIS 
THE ACID REACTS WITH THE STONE AND WEARS IT AWAY 
LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE REACTION 
HERE'S THE ACID I'M PUTTING THE ACID ON THE LIMESTONE 
THIS TIME HYDROCHLORIC ACID IS USED 
AND SMALL AMOUNTS ARE DROPPED ONTO THE ROCK 
THE CARBON DIOXIDE IS BUBBLING UP 
THE HYDROCHLORIC ACID IS REACTING TO THE LIMESTONE 
THIS IS ON A VERY SMALL SCALE 
IN LIMESTONE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY RAIN HAS REACTED WITH THE LIMESTONE 
TO CARVE OUT HUGE CAVE SYSTEMS OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS 
RAINWATER IS NATURALLY ACIDIC DUE TO CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE AIR 
BUT POLLUTION FROM INDUSTRY CAN MAKE IT MORE ACIDIC 
THIS IS WHAT WE CALL ACID RAIN 
SULPHUR DIOXIDE AND OXIDES OF NITROGEN ARE PRODUCED 
BY BURNING FUELS AND ARE THEN RELEASED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE 
THESE ACIDIC GASES MIXED WITH WATER FALL AS ACID RAIN 
THIS HAS HAD AN EFFECT NOT ONLY ON ROCKS AND BUILDINGS 
BUT ALSO ON PLANTS ON LAND AND IN RIVERS AND LAKES 
STRICT CONTROLS ON INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION ARE GRADUALLY REDUCING 
THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY ACID RAIN 
HERE ARE THE KEY POINTS ABOUT PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL WEATHERING 
THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF THIS SECTION ON WEATHERING 
IF YOU WEREN'T SURE OF ANYTHING REWIND AND GO OVER THE KEY POINTS 
IF YOU WANT YOU CAN PUT YOUR FEET UP AND TAKE A BREAK 
THE LAST UNIT IN CHEMISTRY COVERS THE PARTICLE MODEL 
THE PARTICLE THEORY OF MATTER 
IS A KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPT THAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND WELL 
WE USE IT TO EXPLAIN THE PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS LIQUIDS AND GASES 
AND HOW MATTER CHANGES FROM ONE STATE INTO ANOTHER 
LET'S REMIND OURSELVES OF THE THREE STATES 
IN A SOLID PARTICLES ARE CLOSELY PACKED AND HELD TIGHTLY TOGETHER 
THEY'RE NOT COMPLETELY STILL JUST VIBRATING VERY GENTLY 
THIS EXPLAINS WHY SOLIDS HAVE A RIGID STRUCTURE A FIXED SHAPE 
AND ARE HARD TO COMPRESS 
THE PARTICLES IN A LIQUID 
ARE ALSO CLOSELY PACKED BUT THEY MOVE OVER EACH OTHER 
LIQUIDS TAKE ON THE SHAPE OF THEIR CONTAINER 
ARE HARD TO COMPRESS FLOW EASILY AND HAVE A FIXED VOLUME 
IN GASES THE PARTICLES ARE NOT CLOSELY PACKED 
THEY'RE SPACED OUT AND MOVE AROUND VERY QUICKLY 
GASES ALSO TAKE THE SHAPE OF THEIR CONTAINER 
BUT ARE EASY TO COMPRESS AND FLOW READILY 
BUT UNLIKE LIQUIDS THEY HAVE THE VOLUME OF THE CONTAINER 
WE MOST COMMONLY USE THE WORD PARTICLES 
TO DESCRIBE SOLIDS LIQUIDS AND GASES 
BUT TEST QUESTIONS WILL ALSO USE THE WORDS MOLECULES AND ATOMS 
ANOTHER TIP IS HOW YOU DRAW SOLIDS LIQUIDS OR GASES 
TEST QUESTIONS OFTEN ASK YOU TO DRAW THE PARTICLES IN DIFFERENT STATES 
TO MAKE SURE YOU GET ALL THE MARKS WHEN YOU DRAW A SOLID 
DRAW ALL THE PARTICLES TOUCHING AND IN A REGULAR ARRANGEMENT 
WITH A LIQUID DRAW YOUR DIAGRAM WITH MOST OF THE PARTICLES TOUCHING 
IF THEY AREN'T YOU WILL LOSE MARKS 
SPREAD THE PARTICLES RANDOMLY 
AND IF POSSIBLE ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE CONTAINER 
IN A GAS THE PARTICLES ARE WIDELY SPACED AND NOT TOUCHING 
THE NEXT SECTION WILL LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT CHANGES IN STATE 
HOW THE PARTICLE MODEL IS USED TO DESCRIBE 
HOW ICE CHANGES TO A LIQUID AND THEN TO A GAS 
WHEN WATER CHANGES FROM A SOLID INTO A LIQUID OR FROM A LIQUID TO A GAS 
A CHANGE OF STATE HAS TAKEN PLACE 
WHEN THE SOLID ICE CHANGES INTO LIQUID WATER 
IT HAS CHANGED FROM ONE STATE OF MATTER INTO ANOTHER STATE OF MATTER 
THIS IS A PHYSICAL CHANGE 
THE PARTICLES HAVEN'T CHANGED JUST THEIR ARRANGEMENT OR THEIR ENERGY 
LET'S LOOK MORE CLOSELY 
TAKE THE SOLID FAT WHEN HEATED ITS PARTICLES GAIN MORE ENERGY 
THIS MAKES THE PARTICLES MOVE ABOUT MORE WEAKENING THE FORCES 
WHICH HOLD THE SOLID TOGETHER 
THE SOLID EXPANDS AND AT A CERTAIN TEMPERATURE 
THE PARTICLES BREAK FREE FROM THEIR POSITIONS 
THIS IS CALLED THE MELTING POINT 
AND WHEN A SOLID TURNS INTO A LIQUID IT'S CALLED MELTING 
IF WE CARRY ON HEATING THE LIQUID THE PARTICLES GET EVEN MORE ENERGY 
THIS MAKES THE PARTICLES IN A LIQUID MOVE FASTER 
WHICH BREAKS THE BONDS HOLDING THEM TOGETHER AS A LIQUID 
THE MELTED BUTTER IS STARTING TO BUBBLE 
IT'S BECOMING A GAS WITH PARTICLES EVEN FURTHER APART THAN IN A LIQUID 
AND THEY WILL VIBRATE EVEN MORE RAPIDLY 
AT A TEMPERATURE CALLED THE BOILING POINT 
THE PARTICLES HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO BREAK THEIR BONDS 
AND THE LIQUID TURNS INTO A GAS THE LIQUID IS NOW BOILING 
LET'S MAGNIFY WHAT'S HAPPENING AND LOOK AT THE PARTICLE LEVEL 
YOU WOULD SEE A LIQUID IS MADE OUT OF MANY TINY PARTICLES 
JOSTLING FOR SPACE IN THE CONTAINER 
WHEN YOU HEAT THE LIQUID THE PARTICLES JOSTLE MORE AND MORE 
THE PARTICLES GET SO EXCITED AND ENERGETIC 
THAT MORE AND MORE CAN ESCAPE FROM THE LIQUID 
THEY BECOME A GAS 
ONCE THEY'VE ESCAPED FROM THE LIQUID THE PARTICLES SPREAD OUT 
THEY TAKE UP MUCH MORE SPACE 
THAN THE POOR OLD PARTICLES STILL SQUASHED IN THE LIQUID 
THE OPPOSITE HAPPENS IF HEAT IS TAKEN AWAY 
WATER VAPOUR HAS HIT THIS COLD MILK BOTTLE 
AS THE GAS HITS THE COLD GLASS 
IT COOLS DOWN AND ENERGY IS TAKEN AWAY FROM THE PARTICLES 
THEY SLOW DOWN AND GET CLOSER TOGETHER 
UNTIL THE GAS TURNS INTO A LIQUID 
THE WATER VAPOUR CONDENSES BACK INTO A LIQUID 
IF MORE ENERGY IS TAKEN AWAY FROM THE LIQUID IT FREEZES INTO A SOLID 
AT A TEMPERATURE CALLED THE FREEZING POINT 
THIS DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN TO WATER 
DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES WILL HAVE DIFFERENT FREEZING 
MELTING AND BOILING POINTS 
WE CAN ALSO USE THE PARTICLE THEORY OF MATTER TO EXPLAIN 
HOW A BALLOON KEEPS ITS SHAPE 
IT'S BECAUSE OF A GAS AIR 
MILLIONS OF GAS PARTICLES MOVE AROUND QUICKLY IN ALL DIRECTIONS 
CONSTANTLY HITTING THE INSIDE SURFACE OF THE BALLOON 
THIS CONTINUAL BOMBARDMENT CREATES THE PRESSURE 
THAT GIVES THE BALLOON ITS SHAPE 
YOU CAN INCREASE THE PRESSURE INSIDE THIS BALLOON IN TWO WAYS 
YOU CAN PUT MORE AIR IN WHICH MEANS MORE PARTICLES HITTING THE SIDES 
OR THE OTHER WAY IS TO HEAT THE BALLOON 
THIS INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE GIVES THE PARTICLES MORE ENERGY 
AND THEREFORE THEY MOVE FASTER 
HITTING THE SIDES OF THE BALLOON MORE OFTEN AND WITH GREATER FORCE 
BUT REMEMBER THERE'S AIR OUTSIDE THE BALLOON TOO 
THERE'S AIR ALL ROUND US ISN'T THERE YES YES 
AND IT PUSHES ALL THE TIME YEAH YEAH 
SO WHY CAN'T YOU FEEL IT PUSHING YOU NOW 
SMART QUESTION 
YOU CAN'T FEEL IT BECAUSE AIR ALWAYS PRESSES EQUALLY IN ALL DIRECTIONS 
IT'S CALLED AIR PRESSURE 
EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T FEEL IT AIR PRESSURE IS VERY POWERFUL 
WATCH THIS 
THIS MAY LOOK LIKE AN ORDINARY BOTTLE 
BUT IT'S GOT HOLES IN THE BOTTOM 
BUT WHEN THE TOP IS SEALED THE AIR OUTSIDE 
PUSHING UP HOLDS THE WATER INSIDE 
AS THE CANDLE BURNS IT USES UP OXYGEN IN THE AIR 
THE EGG SEALS THE TOP SO NO MORE AIR CAN GET IN 
SOON THE CANDLE USES UP ALL THE OXYGEN IN THE AIR 
THERE IS MORE AIR OUTSIDE THE BOTTLE THAN INSIDE 
SO IT PUSHES THE EGG INTO THE BOTTLE 
SO THE COMPRESSED AIR INSIDE THE BALLOON PUSHES THE SIDES OUT 
AND CREATES PRESSURE ON THE SURFACE 
BUT AIR PRESSURE ON THE OUTSIDE ALSO PUSHES ON THE BALLOON 
WE CAN EXPLAIN PRESSURE BY THE PARTICLE THEORY OF MATTER 
HERE'S A QUESTION FROM A HIGHER TIER PAPER ABOUT GAS PRESSURE 
IT'S GOT SEVERAL PARTS SO WE'LL GO THROUGH THEM ONE AT A TIME 
A GIRL PUMPS UP A BICYCLE TYRE WHICH HAS GONE FLAT 
AS SHE DOES SHE NOTICES THAT THE PUMP BECOMES HOT 
AIR GOING IN TO THE TYRE IS WARMED BY THE PUMPING SO PART A ASKS 
THE CLUE IN THE QUESTION IS THE WORD MOTION 
THE MARKER IS LOOKING FOR A DESCRIPTION 
OF HOW THE GAS MOLECULES ARE MOVING 
THE ANSWER IS THAT WITH AN INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE 
THE GAS MOLECULES WILL SPEED UP THEY WILL MOVE FASTER 
NOW PART B. 
STOP THE TAPE AND HAVE A THINK 
YOU ONLY NEED TO GIVE ONE REASON TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION 
BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL ANSWERS THAT ARE CORRECT 
PRESSURE WILL RISE 
BECAUSE THE MOLECULES WILL HIT THE TYRE WALL MORE FREQUENTLY 
OR YOU COULD SAY THEY HIT THE TYRE WALL HARDER OR FASTER 
ALL THESE ANSWERS ARE CORRECT 
NOW PART C. 
THE KEY PHRASE HERE IS COLLISIONS WITH THE TYRE WALL 
A COMMON MISTAKE IS TO SAY THERE ARE MORE COLLISIONS GENERALLY 
THIS WOULDN'T GET YOU A MARK 
THESE LAST FEW QUESTIONS MAY HAVE SOUNDED SIMILAR 
BUT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ANSWERS 
IF YOU WEREN'T SURE OF THE ANSWERS WHY NOT GO OVER THE QUESTIONS AGAIN 
THE PARTICLE THEORY OF MATTER CAN BE USED TO DESCRIBE ANOTHER PHENOMENON 
YOU CAN SMELL FOOD AND PERFUME 
BECAUSE OF A PROCESS CALLED DIFFUSION 
PARTICLES OF PERFUME SPRAYED FROM AN AEROSOL 
OR PARTICLES FROM FOOD CAN BE SMELT BY PEOPLE IN THE SAME ROOM 
THIS IS BECAUSE THE PARTICLES HAVE SPREAD OUT BY THE ACTION 
OF THE MOVING AIR PARTICLES 
THIS STOPS THEM MAKING FORWARD PROGRESS BUT EVENTUALLY 
THEY WILL SPREAD OUT TO FILL THE ENTIRE ROOM 
AND DIFFUSION DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN IN AIR PARTICLES 
I'M JUST GOING TO PUT SOME CRYSTALS IN 
THE SURFACE OF THE WATER'S TURNING MORE PURPLE 
WHERE THE CRYSTALS WERE IN HIGH CONCENTRATION 
AND THEN IT'S DIFFUSING OUT TO A LOWER CONCENTRATION 
THIS COMPLETES ALL THE UNITS ON CHEMISTRY IN THIS PROGRAMME 
MAKE SURE YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND THE PARTICLE MODEL 
AND CAN USE IT TO DESCRIBE HOW SOLIDS LIQUIDS AND GASES BEHAVE 
REWIND AND PLAY THIS SECTION AGAIN IF YOU NEED TO GO OVER IT 
YOU WILL REMEMBER MORE IF YOU REVISE IN BITESIZE CHUNKS 
SO TIME TO TAKE A BREATHER 
WE'LL NOW MOVE ON TO PHYSICS 
WE'LL COVER THE MATERIAL YOU NEED TO REVISE FOR THE HIGHER TIER PAPER 
WE'LL KICK OFF WITH COLOUR 
WE KNOW THAT WHITE LIGHT IS NOT JUST A SINGLE COLOUR 
IT'S MADE UP OF ALL THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW 
IF WE SHINE A LIGHT THROUGH A PRISM WE CAN SEE THOSE DIFFERENT COLOURS 
THE GLASS PRISM DISPERSES THE WHITE LIGHT 
AND THE NAME FOR THIS RAINBOW EFFECT IS A SPECTRUM 
SO RAINBOWS ARE ALL THE COLOURS OF LIGHT 
BUT I WONDER WHY THE SKY'S BLUE AND SUNSETS ARE ORANGE LET'S FIND OUT 
I KNOW THE SUN PRODUCES LIGHT AND THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE IS THICK 
WHAT'S THAT TO DO WITH COLOUR I'LL SHOW YOU 
I'VE FILLED THIS TANK WITH WATER AND I'M GOING TO PUT MILK POWDER IN IT 
THIS IS QUITE A GOOD REPRESENTATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE 
BECAUSE THE MILK POWDER 
REPRESENTS ALL THE WATER DROPLETS ALL THE DUST 
ALL THE POLLEN AND ALL THE OTHER PARTICLES IN THE ATMOSPHERE 
AND THIS IS OUR SUN PRODUCING WHITE LIGHT JUST LIKE IT DOES IN SPACE 
THE SUNLIGHT IN SPACE IS WHITE 
IF I LOWER THE SUNLIGHT INTO OUR ATMOSPHERE YOU'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
OH YES THE LIGHT AROUND THE BEAM APPEARS TO BE BLUE RIGHT 
AND IF I LOOK ROUND INTO THE END OF THE TANK 
THE SUN'S LIGHT LOOKS YELLOW 
YES THAT'S BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW WHITE LIGHT 
IS MADE UP OF ALL THE COLOURS IN OUR SPECTRUM 
ALL THESE COLOURS GET PUSHED ABOUT BY OUR ATMOSPHERE 
AND THE BLUE LIGHT IS THE ONE THAT'S SCATTERED MOST OF ALL 
SO WHEN YOU SHINE A WHITE LIGHT INTO THE ATMOSPHERE 
ALL THE BLUE LIGHT IS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE SKY 
WHEN YOU TAKE THE BLUE COLOURS AWAY FROM THE SUNLIGHT 
YOU'RE LEFT WITH A YELLOWISH MIXTURE AND THAT'S WHY THE SUN LOOKS YELLOW 
YOU DON'T NEED TO REVISE THAT CLIP FOR YOUR TEST BUT YOU MUST KNOW 
THAT WE CAN SEE COLOUR BECAUSE WHITE LIGHT IS DISPERSED 
THE DIFFERENT COLOURS WE SEE IN THE SKY 
ARE DUE TO HOW MUCH WHITE LIGHT IS DISPERSED THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE 
ANOTHER WAY TO SEE COLOURED LIGHT IS THROUGH COLOURED FILTERS 
THEY ARE TRANSLUCENT MATERIALS 
WHICH ALLOW A SINGLE COLOUR TO PASS THROUGH THE COLOUR OF THE FILTER 
IF I PUT IN A RED FILTER ONLY RED PASSES THROUGH 
THE REST OF THE COLOURS ARE STOPPED OR ABSORBED 
GREEN FILTER ONLY GREEN PASSES THROUGH 
AGAIN THE OTHER COLOURS ARE ABSORBED 
BY USING THESE TWO COLOURED FILTERS 
THIS STUDIO IS LIT BY BLUE 
AND MAGENTA LIGHT 
REMEMBER THE FILTER ONLY ALLOWS ONE COLOUR THROUGH 
AND ABSORBS ALL THE OTHER COLOURS 
WITHOUT THEM WE WOULD JUST HAVE WHITE LIGHT 
THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW 
WE CAN ONLY SEE ANYTHING BECAUSE LIGHT FALLS ON ITS SURFACE 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN LIGHT REACHES THIS SURFACE 
IT'S STOPPED OR ABSORBED AND THIS GLASS 
IT'S ALLOWED THROUGH AND WITH THIS MIRROR BALL 
WHITE LIGHT IS MADE UP OF ALL THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW BUT I'LL USE 
JUST BLUE GREEN AND RED TO MAKE IT EASY FOR YOU TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON 
IF WE SHINE OUR WHITE LIGHT ON DIFFERENT COLOURED OBJECTS 
LOOK WHAT HAPPENS 
A RED OBJECT ABSORBS ALL THE COLOURS OF THE SPECTRUM EXCEPT FOR RED 
WHICH IS REFLECTED 
WE CAN SHOW THIS IF I TURN THE CUBE TO THIS SPECIAL SIDE 
IT'S A SIMILAR STORY WITH THIS GREEN SIDE 
ALL THE COLOURS ARE ABSORBED EXCEPT GREEN 
SO COLOURED OBJECTS REFLECT 
ONLY THE COLOUR OR COLOURS THAT THEY'RE MADE UP OF 
SOMETHING THAT'S BLUE IS REFLECTING BLUE LIGHT 
IT'S ABSORBING ALL THE OTHER COLOURS 
AND BY ONLY REFLECTING THE BLUE PART OF THE SPECTRUM IT APPEARS BLUE 
THINGS THAT ARE WHITE REFLECT ALL THE COLOURS OF THE SPECTRUM 
AND SO THEY APPEAR WHITE 
BLACK OBJECTS ABSORB ALL COLOURS AND REFLECT NONE SO THEY APPEAR BLACK 
REMEMBER IN WHITE LIGHT 
A COLOURED OBJECT REFLECTS ONLY THE LIGHT THAT IS ITS OWN COLOUR 
THE COLOUR YOU ARE SEEING 
BUT WHAT IS GOING ON HERE 
WE'VE GOT ANOTHER PROBLEM WHY DO OUR T. SHIRTS KEEP CHANGING COLOUR 
MY WHITE ONE CHANGES WITH WHATEVER COLOUR SHINES ON IT 
IT LOOKS RED UNDER RED LIGHT GREEN UNDER GREEN LIGHT 
AND BLUE UNDER BLUE LIGHT 
MY RED SHIRT GOES BLACK UNDER GREEN LIGHT 
MY CYAN SHIRT GOES GREEN UNDER GREEN LIGHT 
BLUE UNDER BLUE LIGHT BUT BLACK UNDER RED 
WHAT'S GOING ON 
FIRST OF ALL WHITE OBJECTS IN COLOURED LIGHT 
THEY JUST REFLECT BACK THE COLOUR OF THE LIGHT SHINING ON THEM 
SO IN RED LIGHT THIS PIECE OF PAPER APPEARS RED 
IN BLUE LIGHT THE WHITE PAPER APPEARS BLUE 
REFLECTING BACK THE BLUE LIGHT AND SO ON 
NOW LET'S LOOK AT COLOURED OBJECTS THIS TIME IN COLOURED LIGHTS 
LET'S TAKE A BLUE AND RED BALL IN RED LIGHT 
THE RED BITS REFLECT BACK RED LIGHT BUT THE BLUE STRIPE APPEARS BLACK 
AS THERE IS NO BLUE LIGHT TO REFLECT BACK 
AND THE RED LIGHT HAS BEEN ABSORBED 
THE OPPOSITE HAPPENS IN BLUE LIGHT NOW THE BLUE STRIPE LOOKS BLUE 
BUT THE RED BITS LOOK BLACK AS THERE IS NO RED LIGHT TO REFLECT 
AND THE RED AREAS HAVE ABSORBED ALL THE BLUE LIGHT 
HERE'S A QUESTION FROM A PAST TEST PAPER 
A WHITE ENVELOPE OF PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPER 
HAS WRITTEN ON IT IN LARGE RED LETTERS 
WARNING OPEN ONLY BY THE LIGHT OF A RED SAFELIGHT 
IF THIS ENVELOPE IS PUT INTO A DARKROOM 
WHERE THE ONLY LIGHT IS FROM A RED LAMP 
THE ANSWER YOU SHOULD HAVE COME UP WITH IS 
THE WHITE ENVELOPE REFLECTS ALL THE COLOURS OF THE SPECTRUM 
BUT AS ONLY RED LIGHT IS AVAILABLE 
THE WHITE ONLY REFLECTS BACK THE RED LIGHT 
WHAT DID YOU GET 
THE WHITE ENVELOPE REFLECTS THE GREEN LIGHT SO IT APPEARS GREEN 
THE RED WRITING NOW APPEARS BLACK AS IT HAS NO RED LIGHT TO REFLECT 
AND IT ABSORBS THE GREEN LIGHT 
THIS BRINGS US TO THE END OF THIS SECTION ON COLOUR 
NEXT FORCES AND MOTION 
IN PHYSICS YOU MUST DESCRIBE AND MEASURE THINGS ACCURATELY 
ONE WAY TO DESCRIBE THE MOTION OF AN OBJECT IS BY MEASURING ITS SPEED 
TO WORK OUT THE SPEED OF ANYTHING WE NEED TO KNOW TWO FACTS 
TO FIND OUT THE SPEED OF THIS CAR WE NEED TO KNOW 
THE BEST WAY TO REMEMBER THIS IS BY USING A FORMULA TRIANGLE 
THE EQUATION IS SPEED EQUALS DISTANCE DIVIDED BY TIME 
WE CAN SAY SPEED IS SO MANY KILOMETRES PER HOUR 
YOU CAN ALSO REMEMBER THE PHRASE SIDOT 
IF WE TURN THE EQUATION INTO A TRIANGLE 
IT LOOKS LIKE THIS 
IF WE KNOW ANY TWO COMPONENTS IN THE TRIANGLE WE CAN WORK OUT THE THIRD 
LIKE THIS SPEED EQUALS DISTANCE DIVIDED BY TIME 
DISTANCE EQUALS SPEED MULTIPLIED BY TIME 
TIME EQUALS DISTANCE DIVIDED BY SPEED 
IF A TEST QUESTION ASKS YOU TO FIND OUT THE DISTANCE AN OBJECT TRAVELS 
YOU WILL BE GIVEN THE SPEED AND THE TIME 
WHICH YOU CAN MULTIPLY TOGETHER TO FIND OUT THE DISTANCE 
THE OTHER IMPORTANT THING WHEN WORKING OUT CALCULATIONS IN PHYSICS 
IS TO USE THE CORRECT UNITS 
THERE ARE THREE COMMON UNITS FOR SPEED WHICH YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT 
WHEN YOU'RE DOING CALCULATION QUESTIONS DON'T FORGET THE UNITS 
THESE ARE USUALLY TWO MARK QUESTIONS 
YOU GET ONE FOR DOING THE CALCULATION AND ONE FOR USING THE CORRECT UNITS 
FOR INSTANCE IF YOU'RE CALCULATING SPEED 
THE UNITS ARE METRES PER SECOND 
HERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT SPEED FROM A PAST TEST PAPER 
WHICH USES THE TWO SECOND RULE FOR CAR DRIVERS 
THE HIGHWAY CODE SAYS 
LEAVE ENOUGH SPACE BETWEEN YOU AND THE VEHICLE IN FRONT 
SO YOU CAN PULL UP SAFELY IF IT SUDDENLY SLOWS DOWN 
A TWO SECOND TIME GAP MAY BE SUFFICIENT 
USE STATIONARY OBJECTS LIKE LAMP POSTS 
TO HELP YOU KEEP A TWO SECOND GAP 
SO THE QUESTION IS 
I THINK OUR FORMULA TRIANGLE WILL BE USEFUL HERE 
STOP HERE AND WORK OUT THE DISTANCE 
LET'S SEE HOW WE WORK IT OUT 
WE HAVE OUR FORMULA TRIANGLE DISTANCE SPEED AND TIME 
WE KNOW THE SPEED IS TWENTY METRES PER SECOND AND THE TIME IS TWO SECONDS 
AND WE WANT TO KNOW THE DISTANCE 
FROM THE TRIANGLE DISTANCE EQUALS THE SPEED MULTIPLIED BY THE TIME 
THAT'S TWENTY TIMES TWO EQUALS FORTY 
REMEMBER THE UNIT FOR DISTANCE IN THIS CASE IS METRES 
SO THE ANSWER IS FORTY METRES 
IN PART B. OF THE SAME QUESTION IT SAYS 
READ THE QUESTION CAREFULLY 
AND FIND OUT WHAT ANSWER THEY'RE LOOKING FOR 
NOT WHAT YOU THINK THEY'RE LOOKING FOR 
IN THIS QUESTION WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE TIME TAKEN 
STOP NOW AND WORK OUT WHAT THAT IS 
SO THIS TIME WE KNOW THE SPEED AND THE DISTANCE TRAVELLED 
WE'RE TOLD THE SPEED HAS GONE UP TO TWENTY FIVE METRES PER SECOND 
BUT THE DISTANCE TRAVELLED THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE CARS 
HAS STAYED THE SAME THAT'S FORTY METRES 
IF WE SLOT THOSE INTO OUR FORMULA TRIANGLE 
WE SEE THAT THE TIME EQUALS THE DISTANCE 
DIVIDED BY THE SPEED 
WHICH IS FORTY TWENTY FIFTHS WHICH IS SIXTEEN 
DON'T FORGET THE UNITS SECONDS 
NEXT PRESSURE 
FIRST OF ALL LET'S SORT OUT WHAT PRESSURE IS 
EVERY TIME YOU STAND UP YOU'RE CREATING PRESSURE 
YOUR FEET ARE PUSHING DOWN ON AN AREA OF THE FLOOR 
A FORCE ACTING ON A SURFACE CAUSES PRESSURE 
WHEN A GIRL WEARS A STILETTO HEEL 
THAT PRESSURE ON THE FLOOR WILL INCREASE 
HOW CAN THAT BE WHEN THE WEIGHT OF THE GIRL 
AND THE FORCE EXERTED ON THE FLOOR STAYS THE SAME 
LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK 
IF YOU STAND ON SOMETHING SQUASHY LIKE SAND 
YOU CAN EASILY SEE THE PRESSURE 
CAUSED BY YOUR WEIGHT ACTING OVER THE AREA OF THE SOLE OF YOUR SHOES 
IT'S THE PRESSURE WHICH PRODUCES FOOTPRINTS 
I WEIGH THE SAME BUT MY FOOTPRINT IS DEEPER WEARING THIS 
THAN THIS 
THE PRESSURE DEPENDS ON THE AREA OF THE SOLE OF THE SHOE 
SO AS MY WEIGHT STAYS THE SAME 
IF I DOUBLE THE AREA OF THE SOLE OF MY SHOES I SHOULD HALF THE PRESSURE 
AS THE AREA GETS BIGGER THE PRESSURE GETS SMALLER 
SO THE FOOTPRINTS FROM MY RED SHOES ARE DEEPER THAN THE GREEN ONES 
THEY'RE NOT REALLY ME ARE THEY 
SO PRESSURE IS DEPENDENT ON THE FORCE THAT IS PUSHING 
AND THE AREA OVER WHICH IT PUSHES 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALL THREE PRESSURE FORCE AND AREA 
CAN BE SUMMARISED USING THIS FORMULA 
PRESSURE EQUALS FORCE DIVIDED BY AREA 
WE CAN TURN THIS INTO ANOTHER FORMULA TRIANGLE 
SO THAT AS WITH THE SPEED TRIANGLE 
IF WE KNOW TWO OF THESE COMPONENTS WE CAN WORK OUT THE THIRD 
SO PRESSURE EQUALS FORCE DIVIDED BY AREA 
WE KNOW THAT FORCE EQUALS 
AND AREA EQUALS FORCE DIVIDED BY PRESSURE 
AND REMEMBER YOUR UNITS AGAIN 
FORCE IS MEASURED IN NEWTONS REPRESENTED AS A CAPITAL N. 
AREA IS MEASURED IN METRES SQUARED 
SO PRESSURE IS MEASURED 
IN NEWTONS PER METRE SQUARED 
THE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE EXERTED ON A SURFACE 
HAS SOME IMPORTANT PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 
IF YOU APPLY A FORCE OVER A LARGE SURFACE AREA 
IT RESULTS IN A SMALL PRESSURE 
WHICH IS WHY SKIS OR SNOWSHOES SPREAD YOUR WEIGHT 
OVER THE SURFACE OF THE SNOW 
IF YOU APPLY THE SAME FORCE OVER A SMALL SURFACE AREA 
IT RESULTS IN A BIG PRESSURE 
LIKE THE POINT OF A DRAWING PIN 
SO YOU NEED TO KNOW 
USE THE FORMULA TRIANGLE 
TO HELP COMPLETE ANY CALCULATIONS 
INVOLVING PRESSURE 
THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF THI S. SECTION ON FORCES AND MOTION 
BEFORE WE MOVE ON 
CHECK IF YOU CAN REMEMBER THE FORMULA FOR SPEED DISTANCE AND TIME 
AND FOR PRESSURE FORCE AND AREA 
TIME TO TAKE A BREAK OR MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SECTION 
NOW ON TO ELECTROMAGNETS 
FIRST THEIR STRUCTURE AND STRENGTH 
THE STRUCTURE OF AN ELECTROMAGNET CAN SEEM QUITE COMPLICATED 
SO LET'S RUN THROUGH ONE STEP BY STEP 
FIRST OF ALL A CURRENT GOING THROUGH A WIRE 
CAUSES A MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND THE WIRE 
AND IF WE TAKE A STRAIGHT PIECE OF WIRE AND WRAP IT AROUND A TEST TUBE 
WE CAN MAKE A COIL OF WIRE OR SOLENOID 
NOW IF WE CONNECT IT UP 
SO AN ELECTRIC CURRENT RUNS THROUGH THE COILED WIRE WHAT HAPPENS 
YOU GET A MAGNETIC FIELD AROUND THE COIL 
THAT LOOKS VERY SIMILAR TO THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF A BAR MAGNET 
THIS IS THE BASIS OF THE ELECTROMAGNET 
UNLIKE A BAR MAGNET 
AN ELECTROMAGNET CAN BE SWITCHED ON AND OFF 
THE BASIS OF AN ELECTROMAGNET IS A COIL OF WIRE 
AND WE CAN CHANGE THE STRENGTH OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD IT CREATES 
IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS 
THE STUDENTS HAVE A SIMPLE COIL OF WIRE ATTACHED TO A VOLTMETER 
WHICH PROVIDES THE ELECTRIC CURRENT 
SO WHAT DO WE NEED TO MAKE AN ELECTROMAGNET 
THIS IS AN ELECTROMAGNET JUST WITH THE COILS 
LET'S TEST IT TO SEE IF IT WILL PICK UP ANY NAILS 
IT DOESN'T WORK NO 
HOW ABOUT IF WE TRY IT WITH THE PENCIL 
IT DOESN'T WORK EITHER NO 
HOW ABOUT IF WE TRY IT WITH AN IRON CORE 
IT PICKS UP SOME NAILS 
THE MAGNETIC EFFECT IS INCREASED 
IF AN IRON CORE IS INSERTED INTO THE COIL 
AND IF I SWITCH IT OFF 
ALL THE NAILS DROP OFF 
HOW CAN WE INCREASE THE MAGNETISM INCREASE THE VOLTAGE 
LET'S TRY THAT 
INCREASING THE VOLTAGE INCREASES THE CURRENT FLOWING THROUGH THE WIRE 
IT PICKS UP NAILS 
THEN BACK TO THE ORIGINAL CURRENT 
THEY NOW REPLACE THE COIL WITH ANOTHER ONE 
WITH MORE TURNS IN THE WIRE 
MORE NAILS ARE PICKED UP 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TURN OFF THE VOLTAGE 
IT FALLS OFF AS WELL O. K. 
YOU NEED TO KNOW 
THE STRENGTH OF AN ELECTROMAGNET CAN BE INCREASED IN THREE WAYS 
BY INCREASING THE SIZE OF THE CURRENT 
BY MAKING MORE TURNS IN THE WIRE 
WHICH WILL INCREASE THE MAGNETIC FIELD 
AND BY ADDING A SOFT IRON CORE 
INSIDE THE COIL 
WHICH WILL ALSO CONCENTRATE 
THE MAGNETIC EFFECT 
NEXT APPLICATIONS 
KNOWING THAT ELECTROMAGNETS CAN BE TURNED ON AND OFF 
MAKES THEM VERY USEFUL 
AND THEY'RE USED IN A LARGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT APPLIANCES 
THEY MAKE LOUDSPEAKERS VIBRATE AND MOTORS GO ROUND 
AND THEY CREATE RECORDINGS 
ONTO AUDIO TAPES COMPUTER DISCS AND VIDEO TAPES 
THEY'RE ALSO USED IN RELAYS 
THIS IS A SWITCH WHERE A SMALL ELECTRIC CURRENT 
WILL SWITCH ON A MUCH LARGER CURRENT 
RELAYS ARE OFTEN USED FOR SAFETY REASONS 
ELECTROMAGNETS ARE ALSO USED IN ELECTRIC BELLS 
WHEN THE CURRENT IS TURNED ON THE ELECTROMAGNET ATTRACTS THE HAMMER 
WHICH CLANGS THE BELL BUT ALSO BREAKS THE CIRCUIT 
THIS THEN TURNS OFF THE ELECTROMAGNET 
WHICH RELEASES THE HAMMER 
THE ARMS SPRINGS BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL POSITION 
MAKING THE CIRCUIT COMPLETE AGAIN 
AND SO IT GOES ON VERY QUICKLY 
AS WE CAN HEAR 
SO LET'S LOOK AT A QUESTION FROM A TEST PAPER ABOUT ELECTROMAGNETS 
THIS IS A DIAGRAM SHOWING AN ELECTROMAGNET USED IN A DOOR LOCK 
WE CAN SEE THE PUSH SWITCH THE ELECTROMAGNET IN THE DOOR FRAME 
THE IRON BOLT IN A SPRING AND A SECTION OF THE DOOR 
THE QUESTION IS 
THREE MARKS HAVE BEEN AWARDED FOR THIS ANSWER 
SO WE'RE PROBABLY LOOKING FOR THREE POINTS 
SO WHAT IS THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS 
FROM WHEN THE SWITCH IS CLOSED TO THE DOOR UNLOCKING 
WELL THE SWITCH MAKES THE CIRCUIT COMPLETE AND A CURRENT FLOWS 
THE IRON CORE IN THE COIL WILL BECOME MAGNETISED 
PRODUCING A MAGNETIC FIELD 
THE IRON BOLT IS THEN ATTRACTED TO THE ELECTROMAGNET 
AND SPRINGS OUT OF THE DOOR FRAME UNLOCKING THE DOOR 
THE EXAMINER WILL ALSO BE LOOKING TO MAKE SURE 
YOU'VE GOT THE ORDER OF EVENTS CORRECT 
SO REMEMBER WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON FIRST OF ALL A CURRENT FLOWS 
WHICH MAGNETISES THE IRON CORE 
WHICH THEN ATTRACTS THE IRON BOLT 
THIS BRINGS US TO THE END OF ELECTROMAGNETS 
IF YOU WEREN'T SURE OF THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION 
WHY NOT GO THROUGH THIS SECTION AGAIN 
HERE ARE SOME MORE TOP TIPS TO HELP WITH YOUR REVISION 
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SCHOOL REVISION SESSIONS 
YOU NEVER KNOW HOW USEFUL THEY CAN BE 
OUR LAST PHYSICS UNIT IS ABOUT THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY 
FIRST ENERGY TRANSFER AND STORAGE 
IN PROGRAMME TWO WE LOOKED AT DIFFERENT TYPES OF ENERGY 
BUT LET'S JUST REMIND OURSELVES OF THE SEVEN DIFFERENT FORMS 
LIGHT ENERGY FROM ANYTHING LUMINOUS 
LIKE THE SUN LIGHT BULBS OR CANDLES 
ELECTRIC ENERGY WHENEVER THERE'S AN ELECTRIC CURRENT FLOWING 
THE HOTTER SOMETHING IS THE MORE THERMAL HEAT ENERGY IT HAS 
THERE'S SOUND ENERGY FROM ANYTHING THAT MAKES A NOISE 
VOCAL CHORDS SPEAKERS NOISY MACHINERY 
CHEMICAL ENERGY IS ENERGY STORED CHEMICALLY 
WHICH CAN THEN BE RELEASED 
FOOD FUEL AND BATTERIES ALL HAVE STORED CHEMICAL ENERGY 
POTENTIAL ENERGY IS STORED ENERGY THAT'S READY TO BE RELEASED 
FOR INSTANCE SKY DIVERS ABOUT TO LEAVE AN AEROPLANE 
KINETIC ENERGY IS THE ENERGY OF ANY MOVING OBJECT 
NOW THE TRICKY BIT IS THAT ENERGY CAN NOT ONLY BE STORED 
BUT CAN ALSO BE TRANSFERRED FROM ONE FORM INTO ANOTHER 
WATCH THIS NEXT CLIP 
AND MAKE A NOTE OF SOME OF THE ENERGY TRANSFERS YOU CAN SPOT 
THIS KETTLE NEEDS ENERGY TO BOIL THE WATER 
AND IT'S ENERGY THAT MAKES THIS RADIO WORK 
OR IT WILL WHEN I WIND IT UP 
I'M NOT CREATING THE ENERGY 
I'M TRANSFERRING IT FROM MY MUSCLES TO THE SPRING 
WHERE IT'S STORED UNTIL IT'S NEEDED 
ENERGY TRANSFERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE 
AND THEY'RE NOT DIFFICULT TO SPOT 
THE ENERGY THAT WAS STORED IN THE WOOD IS BEING RELEASED BY BURNING 
AND GIVES OFF HEAT AND LIGHT AND IF YOU LISTEN SOUND AS WELL 
NO SIGNAL IN HERE TRY IT OUTSIDE 
ANOTHER ENERGY TRANSFER 
BUT WHERE DID THE ENERGY COME FROM FOR MY MUSCLES 
IT'S BEEN THROUGH QUITE A FEW TRANSFERS TO GET TO ME 
THE ENERGY WAS TRANSFERRED TO ME THROUGH MY BREAKFAST 
THE ENERGY WAS STORED IN THIS FOOD 
WHEN I ATE IT SOME OF IT WENT INTO KEEPING ME ALIVE AND WARM 
THE REST WAS STORED FOR WHEN I NEEDED IT 
BUT WHERE DID THE PLANTS GET THEIR ENERGY FROM 
THE SUN IS THE MAIN SOURCE OF ENERGY USED ON EARTH 
NOW PLANTS CAPTURE THAT ENERGY FROM THE SUN BY PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
WHICH INVOLVES GREEN PLANTS TURNING LIGHT CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER 
INTO FOOD WHICH IS THEIR STORED ENERGY 
SO ALL ALONG THE WAY FROM THE SUN TO ME 
ENERGY IS BEING STORED AND RELEASED 
NOW FOOD IS AN ENERGY STORE AND ANY STORED ENERGY 
IS CALLED POTENTIAL ENERGY 
SO WHEN THE ENERGY FROM FOOD IS RELEASED I CAN USE IT 
I CAN MOVE MY MUSCLES 
WHEN I TURN THE HANDLE THE POTENTIAL ENERGY FROM MY MUSCLES 
IS TRANSFERRED AND STORED IN THE SPRING 
WHEN I RELEASE THE SPRING THE ENERGY IS TRANSFERRED INTO ELECTRICITY 
AND THE RADIO WILL WORK 
NOW IT PRODUCES SOUND AND SOME HEAT IS GENERATED AS WELL 
THAT'S WHY THE RADIO FEELS WARM 
NO STILL NOTHING IT'S NOT REALLY SURPRISING 
I'M NOWHERE NEAR ANY RADIO STATIONS 
WELL THERE WERE LOTS OF DIFFERENT ENERGY TRANSFERS GOING ON THERE 
LET'S RUN THROUGH A FEW OF THEM AGAIN 
HERE WE HAVE HEAT ENERGY TO LIGHT ENERGY AND SOUND ENERGY 
THE FOOD PROVIDES CHEMICAL ENERGY 
WHICH IS TRANSFERRED INTO THERMAL KINETIC AND POTENTIAL ENERGY 
LIGHT ENERGY FROM THE SUN IS TRANSFERRED 
INTO CHEMICAL POTENTIAL ENERGY STORED IN THE PLANTS 
WHEN STELLA WINDS THE SPRING UP KINETIC ENERGY FROM THE MOVING ARM 
IS TRANSFERRED INTO POTENTIAL ENERGY STORED IN THE SPRING 
WHEN THE SPRING IN THE RADIO IS RELEASED 
THE POTENTIAL ENERGY IS TRANSFERRED INTO KINETIC ELECTRIC SOUND 
AND THERMAL ENERGY 
LOTS OF EXAMPLES OF ENERGY TRANSFERS 
THIS IS THE RADIO FROM THE PLANE 
I'VE BUILT A MACHINE TO TRY AND MAKE IT WORK 
NOW WHAT ENERGY TRANSFERS ARE GOING ON HERE 
THE BUCKET FILLS WITH WATER 
HIGH UP IT HAS POTENTIAL ENERGY 
WHEN IT'S HEAVY ENOUGH IT STARTS TO FALL 
AS IT COMES DOWN THE POTENTIAL ENERGY TRANSFERS TO MOVEMENT 
OR KINETIC ENERGY IN THE WHEEL 
AS THE WHEEL TURNS KINETIC ENERGY IS TRANSFERRED TO THIS DYNAMO 
IT ALSO PRODUCES SOUND AND A BIT OF HEAT TOO 
THE DYNAMO TRANSFERS KINETIC ENERGY INTO ELECTRICITY 
THE RADIO TRANSFERS THE ELECTRICITY TO SOUND AND SOME HEAT 
SO THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS MAINLY A TRANSFER OF POTENTIAL ENERGY 
AND KINETIC ENERGY 
NOW ONLY SIX PER CENT OF THE POTENTIAL ENERGY THE BUCKET HAD 
IS GOING TO THE RADIO 
SO IT'S NOT VERY EFFICIENT BUT IT'S VERY USEFUL 
SO WE KNOW THAT ENERGY CAN BE TRANSFERRED FROM ONE FORM TO ANOTHER 
BUT AS WE SAW IN THE CLIP 
ONLY SIX PER CENT OF THE ENERGY FROM THE BUCKET WENT INTO THE RADIO 
SO STELLA'S SYSTEM WASN'T VERY EFFICIENT 
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHER NINETY FOUR PER CENT 
WELL ONE OF THE KEY POINTS ABOUT ENERGY YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND WELL 
IS THAT ENERGY NEVER DISAPPEARS IT'S NEVER DESTROYED 
IT'S ALWAYS TRANSFERRED FROM ONE FORM INTO ANOTHER 
IN THE CASE OF STELLA'S INVENTION 
THE ENERGY THAT DIDN'T PASS INTO THE RADIO WOULD HAVE BEEN WASTED ENERGY 
IN THE FORM OF THERMAL ENERGY AND SOUND ENERGY 
NO ENERGY IS EVER DESTROYED 
THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY 
ENERGY CAN NEVER BE CREATED NOR DESTROYED 
IT'S TRANSFERRED FROM ONE FORM INTO ANOTHER 
ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACT ABOUT ENERGY IS THAT IT'S OFTEN ONLY USEFUL 
WHEN IT CAN BE TRANSFERRED FROM ONE FORM INTO ANOTHER 
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT ALL USEFUL MACHINES USE ONE KIND OF ENERGY 
AND GIVE OUT ANOTHER 
FOR INSTANCE THIS LIGHT BULB CONVERTS ELECTRIC ENERGY 
INTO LIGHT ENERGY SO WE CAN SEE BY IT 
THIS RADIO TRANSFERS THE CHEMICAL ENERGY STORED IN THE BATTERIES 
INTO SOUND ENERGY 
AND THIS KETTLE CONVERTS ELECTRIC ENERGY INTO HEAT ENERGY 
WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED TO BOIL THE WATER 
ONE FORM OF ENERGY TRANSFERRED INTO ANOTHER USEFUL FORM 
THESE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT KEY POINTS TO GET TO GRIPS WITH 
FIRST THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY WHICH YOU NEED TO LEARN 
IT STATES THAT ENERGY CAN NEVER BE CREATED NOR DESTROYED 
BUT IS TRANSFERRED FROM ONE FORM INTO ANOTHER 
SO ENERGY IS NEVER LOST COMPLETELY BUT IT CAN BE WASTED 
AND BECOME SOMETHING LESS USEFUL LIKE THERMAL ENERGY OR SOUND 
AND REMEMBER 
ENERGY CAN BE MADE MORE USEFUL 
WHEN IT'S CONVERTED 
FROM ONE FORM TO ANOTHER 
HERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT ENERGY TRANSFERS FROM A PAST PAPER 
IT'S ABOUT A BELL IN A CHURCH TOWER 
THAT'S ATTACHED TO A WHEEL 
AND BALANCED UPSIDE DOWN 
FROM THE EDGE OF THE WHEEL IS A ROPE 
THAT THE BELL RINGER CAN PULL 
TO SET THE BELL RINGING 
THE ENERGY GIVEN OUT BY THE BELL 
WAS ORIGINALLY STORED IN THE BELL RINGER 
SO THE QUESTION IS 
NOW THREE MARKS ARE ON OFFER FOR THIS ANSWER 
SO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THREE ENERGY TRANSFERS 
STOP THE PROGRAMME AND HAVE A GO 
SO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN 
THE BELL WILL START MOVING 
THEN FALL THE REST OF THE WAY ROUND AND MAKE A SOUND 
BUT THAT'S JUST DESCRIBING WHAT HAPPENS AND WON'T GET ANY MARKS 
THE QUESTION WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT THE ENERGY TRANSFERS TAKING PLACE 
SO LET'S HAVE A CLOSER LOOK 
CHEMICAL ENERGY WAS ORIGINALLY STORED IN THE BELL RINGER'S MUSCLES 
THIS IS TRANSFERRED TO KINETIC ENERGY 
IN HIS ARMS THE ROPE AND THE BELL 
AS THE HEIGHT OF THE BELL INCREASES THIS KINETIC ENERGY IS STORED 
AS GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL ENERGY 
WHEN THE BELL FALLS 
THIS GRAVITATIONAL ENERGY IS TRANSFERRED 
TO KINETIC AND SOUND ENERGY 
IT'S QUITE COMPLICATED 
SO YOU MAY WANT TO GOT THROUGH THE QUESTION AND ANSWER AGAIN 
IF YOU FEEL HAPPY YOU CAN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SECTION 
ON TEMPERATURE AND THERMAL ENERGY 
FIRST OF ALL LET'S SORT OUT WHAT WE MEAN BY TEMPERATURE AND HEAT 
FOR A START THEY REPRESENT DIFFERENT THINGS 
TEMPERATURE IS A MEASUREMENT USED TO MEASURE HOW HOT SOMETHING IS 
AND ITS UNIT IS DEGREES CELSIUS 
HEAT IS A FORM OF ENERGY OFTEN CALLED THERMAL ENERGY 
AND WE MEASURE IT IN JOULES J. 
THE TROUBLE IS WE COMMONLY USE THE WORD TEMPERATURE IN THE WRONG WAY 
FOR INSTANCE WHEN WE'RE ILL OR FEVERISH 
WE SAY WE HAVE A TEMPERATURE WHEN WHAT WE REALLY MEAN 
IS THAT THE TEMPERATURE WHEN WE'RE ILL IS HIGHER 
THAN OUR NORMAL MEASURE OF TEMPERATURE 
LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK 
TEMPERATURE IS MEASURED IN DEGREES AND THE SCALE WE USE MOSTLY NOWADAYS 
WAS WORKED OUT BY A SWEDISH ASTRONOMER CALLED CELSIUS 
A THERMOMETER WOULD BE USEFUL 
TO CHECK THAT THE CAVE ISN'T TOO COLD FOR MY PLANTS 
BUT THIS ONE HASN'T GOT A SCALE 
I PROBABLY COULD MAKE ONE 
THE BULB IS SURROUNDED BY MELTING ICE 
AND THE ETHANOL HAS HAD TIME TO SETTLE DOWN 
IT'S STOPPED MOVING 
THE ETHANOL IS DYED BLUE SO WE CAN SEE IT 
ICE IS FROZEN WATER THIS MARK 
INDICATES THE FREEZING POINT OF WATER 
WHICH CELSIUS CALLED ZERO DEGREES 
HEATING THE ICE WILL TURN IT TO WATER 
THE ENERGY OF THE WATER IS BEING TRANSFERRED INTO THE ETHANOL 
SO IT RAISES ITS TEMPERATURE 
THE HEATED ETHANOL MOVES UP THE TUBE BECAUSE IT'S EXPANDING 
THE WATER IS NOW BOILING AND THE ETHANOL HAS STOPPED RISING 
THIS MARK IS THE BOILING POINT OF WATER 
WHICH CELSIUS CALLED ONE HUNDRED DEGREES 
BY DIVIDING THE DISTANCE EQUALLY BETWEEN THE TWO POINTS 
WE GET A SCALE 
THE LEVEL OF THE ETHANOL 
WILL TELL US THE TEMPERATURE OF WHATEVER IS SURROUNDING IT 
SO IF I LEAVE THIS HERE IT WILL TELL ME THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CAVE 
SO TEMPERATURE AND THERMAL ENERGY HEAT ARE NOT THE SAME THING 
THIS SPARKLER IS EXTREMELY HOT AND IF I TOUCHED IT 
I WOULD GET BURNT 
THIS BASIN FULL OF WARM WATER 
IS AT A MUCH LOWER TEMPERATURE THAN THE SPARKLER 
I CAN PUT MY HAND INTO IT 
BUT WHICH DO YOU THINK HAS THE GREATEST HEAT ENERGY 
IN FACT ALTHOUGH THE WATER IS AT A LOWER TEMPERATURE 
IT CONTAINS MORE THERMAL ENERGY 
THIS IS BECAUSE THERE ARE FAR MORE PARTICLES 
MOVING ABOUT IN THE BODY OF WATER THAN AT THE TIP OF THE SPARKLER 
THE ATOMS IN THE SPARKLER ARE VIBRATING A LOT 
BUT THERE ARE FAR FEWER OF THEM 
SO THE TOTAL ENERGY IS MUCH SMALLER 
THAN IN THE BASIN OF WARM WATER 
SO YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT TEMPERATURE AND HEAT ARE DIFFERENT 
WE'RE NOW GOING TO LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS 
WHEN THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN TEMPERATURE 
THERMAL ENERGY IS ONLY TRANSFERRED 
IF THERE'S A TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO PLACES 
AND THE HEAT ALWAYS TRAVELS FROM A HOTTER TO A COLDER PLACE 
THIS CAN HAPPEN IN THREE DIFFERENT WAYS 
CALLED CONDUCTION CONVECTION AND RADIATION 
LET'S LOOK AT CONDUCTION FIRST 
WHEN HEAT IS TRANSFERRED THROUGH A SOLID 
LIKE THIS KNIFE THAT'S OUT IN THE SUN 
THIS KIND OF ENERGY FLOW IS CALLED CONDUCTION 
THE PARTICLES INSIDE METALS ARE ESPECIALLY GOOD AT CONDUCTING HEAT 
WHEN THESE TIGHTLY PACKED PARTICLES ARE HEATED 
THEY GAIN MORE ENERGY VIBRATE MORE QUICKLY 
AND THE HEAT ENERGY IS SWIFTLY PASSED ALONG 
FROM PARTICLE TO ANOTHER 
OW THAT'S HOT 
BY TOUCHING THE HOT METAL OBJECT 
THE HEAT ENERGY FLOWS ONCE AGAIN 
VERY QUICKLY FROM THE METAL TO ORIANNE'S SKIN 
THE MORE ENERGY THERE IS THE HOTTER IT FEELS 
HEAT FLOWS BECAUSE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN TEMPERATURE 
IT ALWAYS TRANSFERS FROM WARMER OBJECTS OR PLACES 
HERE THE KNIFE 
TO COOLER ONES LIKE ORIANNE'S SKIN 
THIS IS ALSO TRUE WHEN SOMETHING VERY COLD 
IS PLACED AGAINST SOMEONE'S WARM SKIN 
OH 
HEAT ENERGY FLOWS VERY QUICKLY 
BUT THIS TIME FROM THE SKIN WHICH IS WARM 
TO THE METAL WHICH IS COLD 
IT'S THE SUDDEN LOSS OF HEAT FROM THE SKIN 
WHICH MAKES THE METAL FEEL VERY COLD 
IT'S HEAT THAT TRANSFERS NEVER THE COLD 
CONDUCTION IS WHEN VIBRATING PARTICLES 
PASS ON THEIR EXTRA VIBRATIONAL ENERGY 
TO NEIGHBOURING PARTICLES 
THAT'S WHY A METAL CUP FULL OF HOT WATER FEELS TOO HOT TO HOLD 
THE THERMAL ENERGY FROM THE HOT WATER IS CONDUCTED THROUGH THE METAL 
TO MY HAND 
BUT THIS POLYSTYRENE CUP IS SAFE TO PICK UP 
THE THERMAL ENERGY ISN'T CONDUCTED THROUGH THE MATERIAL 
FROM THE HOT WATER TO MY HANDS 
METALS ARE GOOD CONDUCTORS WHILE THE POLYSTYRENE IS A POOR CONDUCTOR 
BUT A GOOD INSULATOR 
THE SECOND WAY THERMAL ENERGY TRAVELS 
FROM HOT THINGS TO COLD THINGS IS CALLED CONVECTION 
THIS IS WHERE HEATED MATERIAL MOVES IN BULK TO A COOLER REGION 
AND TAKES THE HEAT WITH IT 
FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS HOW RADIATORS HEAT UP A ROOM 
THE AIR ABOVE A RADIATOR WARMS UP FIRST 
AND RISES TO COLDER PARTS OF THE ROOM 
COLDER AIR REPLACES THE WARMER AIR AND AGAIN RISES 
SO A CONVECTION CURRENT IS CREATED 
THE THIRD WAY THERMAL ENERGY MOVES FROM HOT AREAS TO COLD 
IS BY RADIATION 
ALL HOT OBJECTS RADIATE HEAT TO THEIR SURROUNDINGS 
BY INVISIBLE WAVES 
UNLIKE CONVECTION AND CONDUCTION 
THESE WAVES DON'T NEED PARTICLES OF MATTER TO TRAVEL THROUGH 
THIS MEANS THAT ENERGY WAVES CAN PASS THROUGH A VACUUM 
AND THAT'S HOW THE SUN'S RAYS REACH THE EARTH 
A THERMOGRAM IS A SPECIAL CAMERA THAT IS SENSITIVE TO THERMAL ENERGY 
AND HERE WE HAVE FEMI DEMONSTRATING 
YOU CAN SEE IT ON MY FACE IT'S DIFFERENT COLOURS 
DEPENDING ON HOW WARM VARIOUS BITS OF MY FACE ARE 
MY EYES ARE HOTTEST 
MY NOSE IS COOLER AND MY GREEN HAIR COOLEST OF ALL 
FIRST OF ALL 
AND HEAT CAN BE TRANSFERRED IN THREE DIFFERENT WAYS 
BRILLIANT YOU'VE COME TO THE END OF THIS THIRD SCIENCE PROGRAMME 
IN THE KEY STAGE THREE BITESIZE REVISION SERIES 
DON'T FORGET TO COMPLETE YOUR REVISION 
YOU SHOULD LOOK AT PROGRAMMES ONE AND TWO 
REMEMBER ALWAYS PLAN YOUR REVISION TIME WELL AHEAD 
AND GIVE YOURSELF PLENTY OF BREAKS
