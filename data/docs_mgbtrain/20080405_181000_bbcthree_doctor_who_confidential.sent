SERIES FOUR WE'VE GOT CATHERINE TATE IS BACK AS DONNA 
OH MY GOD 
IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK YEAH IT'S AS IF I NEVER LEFT ACTUALLY 
DOCTOR THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT I SHOULD'VE STAYED AT HOME 
SHE'S A BRILLIANT CHARACTER CATHERINE IS A GREAT ACTRESS 
OH I KNOW ALL THAT BIT 
CATHERINE'S FIRST DAY ON SET FELT LIKE SHE'D NEVER BEEN AWAY 
QUICKER THAN A RAY OF LIGHT 
QUICKER THAN A RAY OF LIGHT 
QUICKER THAN A RAY OF LI I. IGHT 
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES 
WITH THE SCRIPT FOR PARTNERS IN CRIME COMPLETE 
THE CAST AND CREW ARE GATHERED AT THEIR CARDIFF STUDIOS FOR THE FIRST READ THROUGH OF THE SERIES 
THE READ THROUGH IS VITAL FOR THE PRODUCTION TEAM 
IT IS THE ONLY TIME WE GET TO HEAR THE WHOLE THING 
BEFORE WE SIT IN THE EDIT BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS FILMED OUT OF SEQUENCE 
SO IT BECOMES A RADIO PLAY 
YOU CAN SIT IN YOUR OFFICE YOU CAN BREAK SCRIPTS DOWN 
YOU CAN READ THEM IN BED 
IMAGINE HOW THEY ARE GOING TO BE AND SOUND BUT UNTIL YOU HEAR THE ACTORS YOU HAVE CAST 
READING THOSE LINES IT IS THE FIRST TIME REALLY THAT THE WHOLE THING COMES TO LIFE 
MARVELLOUS YES HOORAY I WILL BE READING THE STAGE DIRECTIONS ALWAYS EXCITING A LOT OF THEM IN IT 
I MIGHT READ MORE THAN I NORMALLY WOULD BECAUSE CONFIDENTIAL ASKED ME TO READ OUT CERTAIN BITS IN DETAIL 
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LIKE THERE WE GO I AM A SLAVE TO THEM 
IT IS BRILLIANT TO SEE EVERYONE BACK WELCOME BACK DONNA OFFICIALLY SHE'S ARRIVED AT LAST 
THANK YOU TO EVERYONE ELSE HERE HAVE A GOOD TIME O. K. SO RIGHT SCENE ONE OMITTED OH GOOD START 
IT WAS A GREAT SCENE SARAH OUT 
EXTERIOR NOBLE'S HOUSE CHEEKY MUSIC DONNA STEPS OUT HEAD HELD HIGH ON A MISSION 
DONNA WALKING ALONG LEFT TO RIGHT 
THE DOCTOR WALKING ALONG RIGHT TO LEFT 
DONNA STOPS IN THE STREET AND LOOKS UP THE TOWER BLOCK WHICH IS THE H. Q. OF ADIPOSE INDUSTRIES 
THE FIRST HALF OF THE EPISODE IS BASICALLY ABOUT THE FACT 
THAT THE TWO OF THEM KEEP MISSING EACH OTHER 
DOES HE NEED A COKE THANKS THEN WHAT'S THAT 
DONNA HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR THE DOCTOR 
BRINGING SOMEONE WHO HAS MET THE DOCTOR BEFORE BACK IS A CHANCE FOR COMEDY 
SO THE OPENING TWENTY MINUTES OF PARTNERS IN CRIME WHERE THEY ARE SIMPLY MISSING EACH OTHER IS IRRESISTIBLE 
YOU REALLY GET THE SENSE OF DONNA'S DESPERATION TO FIND HIM WHICH IS REALLY ENDEARING I THINK 
AND I LOVE THAT PART OF THE SCRIPT 
IT'S SURPRISING WHEN THE DOCTOR SEES DONNA FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IN HIS MIND OF COURSE UNTIL HE REALISES THAT SHE HAS BEEN CHASING HIM 
IT IS SUCH A RANDOM EVENT IN THE MIDDLE OF HIM 
PURSUING AN ALIEN INVASION 
HE STUMBLES ACROSS DONNA NOBLE FROM TWO CHRISTMASES AGO 
IT IS A GREAT WAY TO REINTRODUCE THE CHARACTERS TO EACH OTHER 
IN A MOMENT OF GREAT PERIL YOU HAVE THIS SORT OF DUMB SHOW 
AND YOU SAW THAT ON THE PAGE YOU KNOW THEM MIMING THIS CONVERSATION TO EACH OTHER 
THE DOCTOR LOOKS STRAIGHT AHEAD AND DONNA LOOKS STRAIGHT AHEAD AND SHE SEES HIM 
AND HE SEES HER 
DOCTOR 
OH MY GOD 
BIG LONG MOMENT WITH THIS BOGGLING OPEN MOUTH THEN ALL SHOT THROUGH THE GLASS IN SILENCE 
THE DOCTOR IS LIKE DONNA 
DONNA SAYS OH MY GOD BUT HOW IT'S ME HE SAYS WELL I CAN SEE THAT 
SHE LIKE OH THIS IS BRILLIANT 
THERE WAS JUST THIS PARAGRAPH THAT CATHERINE HAD TO SOMEHOW TRANSLATE THROUGH THE GIFT OF MIME 
I SAID TO JAMES STRONG THE DIRECTOR THE DAY BEFORE 
I SAID HAVE YOU GOT ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW AT ALL 
AND HE SAID NO HE SAID I'LL ASK RUSSELL 
THEN THE MESSAGE CAME BACK OH SEE WHAT CATHERINE COMES UP WITH 
SO I KIND OF DID IT A BIT ON THE HOOF ACTUALLY 
WELL AS WE WERE FILMING IT REALLY AND JUST MUCKED ABOUT A BIT WITH IT 
AND WILL BE TAKING A CAREER IN MIME A LOT FURTHER IN PERFORMANCE ART 
BUT IT'S A LOVELY FIRST SCENE AND BEAUTIFULLY PLACED IN THE EPISODE 
JUST AS THE STAKES ARE GETTING HIGHER 
THESE TWO CHARACTERS THAT YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING JUST MISS EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TWENTY MINUTES 
SUDDENLY COLLIDE INTO EACH OTHER AT THE MOST INOPPORTUNE MOMENT 
ARE WE INTERRUPTING YOU 
AND THE DOCTOR SONICS THE WINCH AND ZOOM HE DISAPPEARS UP 
DONNA RUNS UP THE STAIRWAY 
THE DOCTOR ARRIVES BACK ON THE ROOF RUNS ACROSS TO THE ACCESS DOOR 
DONNA IS RUNNING UP THE DOCTOR'S RUNNING DOWN AND THEY MEET ON A LANDING 
OH MY GOD I DON'T BELIEVE IT 
YOU'VE EVEN GOT THE SAME SUIT DON'T YOU EVER CHANGE THANKS DONNA NOT RIGHT NOW 
CATHERINE'S FIRST DAY ON SET FELT LIKE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN AWAY 
IT WAS LIKE YOU KNOW CATCHING UP WITH AN OLD MATE 
COS IT'S THE SECOND TIME I'VE WORKED WITH HIM I DON'T HAVE TO CURTSY EVERY MORNING 
WHICH WAS THE RITUAL WHEN I WAS IN THE CHRISTMAS SPECIAL 
SO NOW I DON'T HAVE TO SO THAT'S GREAT 
YOU LOOK OLDER 
THANKS 
DONNA FELT LIKE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN AWAY AS WELL 
CATHERINE JUST NAILS IT FROM THE INSTANT SHE WALKS ON SET 
OFF WE GO THEN SO IT ALL FELT VERY NATURAL FUNNILY ENOUGH 
IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT WAS THE START OF ANYTHING NEW 
IT FELT LIKE IT WAS THE CONTINUATION OF SOMETHING 
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES THEY RUN UP THE STAIRS TOGETHER 
I THOUGHT I HAVE TO FIND THE DOCTOR 
THEN I THOUGHT LOOK FOR TROUBLE AND HE'LL TURN UP I LOOKED EVERYWHERE 
YOU NAME IT U. F. O. SIGHTINGS CROP CIRCLES WEIRD THINGS IN CARDIFF I INVESTIGATED THEM ALL 
SHE IS MUCH MORE STRAIGHT TALKING WITH HIM 
BECAUSE THE THING IS DOCTOR I BELIEVE IT ALL NOW 
ALL THOSE AMAZING THINGS OUT THERE I BELIEVE 'EM ALL 
EXCEPT FOR THE REPLICA OF THE TITANIC FLYING OVER BUCKINGHAM PALACE THAT'S GOT TO BE A HOAX 
THERE'S FAR LESS OVERT ADMIRATION FOR HIM 
COME ON IN YOU GET 
WHAT INTO THAT THING YES INTO THAT THING 
IF WE GO DOWN IN THAT THEY'LL CALL US BACK UP 
SHE'S FORTHRIGHT SHE'S CAUSTIC 
DOCTOR HOLD ON 
I AM 
THIS IS YOUR FAULT 
I SHOULD'VE STAYED AT HOME 
SHE IS VERY FUNNY VERY WITTY VERY SHARP 
SOME PEOPLE JUST CAN'T TAKE IT NO 
AND SOME PEOPLE CAN 
DOESN'T TAKE ANY NONSENSE FROM ANYBODY NO MATTER WHAT SPECIES THEY MAY BE 
WHAT ABOUT POOR STACEY 
SHE KNOWS WHO SHE IS SHE'S IN THAT SENSE SHE'S MORE OF A GROWN UP THAN ROSE OR MARTHA WERE 
SHE'S A GREAT SORT OF LEVEL PEGGING FOR THE DOCTOR TO BRING HIM DOWN 
AND TO JUST NAIL HIM SOMETIMES AND CALL HIM ON HIS JUDGMENTS 
DOCTOR TELL ME WHAT DO YOU NEED 
I NEED A SECOND CAPSULE BUT I'VE ONLY GOT ONE I CAN'T SAVE THEM 
DONNA CALMLY REACHES INTO HER POCKET AND HOLDS UP HER GOLD CAPSULE AND PENDANT THE DOCTOR LOOKS AT HER 
SHE LOOKS AT HIM THE MOMENT'S SUSPENDED IT'S JUST MAGIC 
THE GREAT THING SHE DOES FOR THE DOCTOR IS GIVE HIM A HARD TIME ACTUALLY 
ABOUT HIS MORALS ABOUT THE WAY HE THINKS ABOUT THE UNIVERSE 
ABOUT THE WAY HE THINKS ABOUT HUMANITY 
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO THEN BLOW 'EM UP 
THEY'RE JUST CHILDREN THEY CAN'T HELP WHERE THEY CAME FROM 
THAT MAKES A CHANGE FROM LAST TIME 
SHE'S THE DOCTOR'S EQUAL IN A WAY THAT ROSE AND MARTHA WEREN'T STILL ON YOUR OWN 
YEAH WELL NO I HAD THIS FRIEND CALLED MARTHA MARTHA JONES SHE WAS BRILLIANT YEAH 
SHE FANCIED ME 
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE CHARACTER HASN'T ROMANTICISED THE DOCTOR 
SHE JUST SEES HIM AS THIS PEER REALLY 
THIS KIND OF CONTEMPORARY AND EQUAL 
THAT DOES STRIP AWAY THE KIND OF ROSE COLOURED GLASSES 
AND SHE MAKES IT CLEAR TO THE DOCTOR THAT THERE IS NO DANGER OF HER FALLING IN LOVE WITH HIM 
YOU JUST WANT TO MATE 
I JUST WANT A MATE 
YOU'RE NOT MATING WITH ME SUNSHINE A I WANT A MATE 
JUST AS WELL I'M NOT HAVING ANY OF THAT NONSENSE YOU ARE A SKINNY STREAK OF NOTHING ALIEN NOTHING 
THERE WE ARE THEN O. K. 
FOR ALL HER KIND OF STRAIGHT TALKING AND BOSSINESS 
AND YOU DON'T IMPRESS ME AND REALLY I DON'T WANT TO MATE 
YOU KNOW THERE'S THAT WHOLE KIND OF THING THERE 
SHE IS ACTUALLY THE ONE SHE IS ACTUALLY MUCH MORE AFFECTED BY THINGS 
AND I THINK SHE GIVES A VERY HUMAN RESPONSE TO THE THINGS THAT GO ON AROUND HER 
SHE'S HAD TO FIGHT A LOT THROUGH HER LIFE 
AND I THINK SHE IS A VERY INTELLIGENT WOMAN BECAUSE OF THAT 
DONNA HAS HAD HER FORMATIVE YEARS SHE IS AFTER SHE IS AFTER MAKING SURE THAT HER 
THE REST OF HER LIFE LIVES UP TO THE POTENTIAL THAT PERHAPS THE FIRST PART OF HER LIFE DIDN'T 
I WAS RIGHT IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THIS WITH YOU INNIT 
OH YES AND OFF WE GO 
O. I. 
COME ON 
BANG THE DOOR OPENS THEY GO OUT TO THE ROOF IT'S EMPTY THE CRADLE IS GONE 
THE LOWERING MECHANISM AT WORK CUT TO THE WIDE SHOT THERE'S THE DOCTOR AND DONNA HEADING DOWN 
THE CRADLE SEQUENCE REALLY IS CLASSIC ACTION MOVIE FORMULA 
MISS FOSTER IS SMILING OH I DON'T THINK SO 
AIMS HER SONIC PEN THE ROOFTOP EXPLODES THE DOCTOR AND DONNA PLUMMET DOWN GOD HELP US 
TOWER BLOCK FALLS RACING PAST THEM 
YOU GET THE SEQUENCES NOW AND AGAIN BIG ACTION SEQUENCES THAT MUST IF YOU'RE A DIRECTOR 
MUST MAKE YOUR BRAIN BLEED A LITTLE BIT 
JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE YOU CAN PASTE THEM ALL TOGETHER 
THEY ARE MAKING THEIR ESCAPE IN A WINDOW CLEANER'S CRADLE ON THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING 
BUT THAT WAS POSSIBLY THE SINGLE BIGGEST LOGISTICAL CHALLENGE OF MY ENTIRE CAREER 
SO IT WAS A COMBINATION OF THE REAL LOCATION 
THE REAL LOCATION DOUBLING UP SOMEWHERE ELSE 
WE HAD TWO LOCATIONS WHICH WE WERE SAYING WAS THE ONE LOCATION 
PLUS THE GREEN SCREEN ELEMENT PLUS THE SET WE BUILT AS WELL FOR CERTAIN ELEMENTS 
SO YOU GOT FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF ONE SCENE WITH FOUR DIFFERENT PEOPLE DOING IT 
SO YOU'VE GOT CATHERINE AND DAVID YOU'VE GOT TWO STUNT PERFORMERS IN FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS 
AND GREEN SCREEN SHOTS AND STUNT SHOTS AND EXPLOSIONS AND WINDOWS AND STUFF 
SO THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE THAT WE PLANNED AND PLANNED 
I COULD SIT AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE LOGISTICAL NIGHTMARE THAT IT TOOK THE DIRECTOR PRODUCTION MANAGER 
THE PRODUCER THE STUNT CO ORDINATOR I DON'T CARE 
THEY JUST GO OUT THERE AND MAKE IT BRILLIANT CAN I SAY THAT 
CAN WE GIVE BOB HIS SCHEDULE 
DAY ONE ON THE ROOF IS TUESDAY THE NINTH OF OCTOBER 
NIGHT SHOOTING 
SO THAT'S EIGHTEEN HUNDRED TO FIVE IN THE MORNING 
VERTICAL CRADLE THIS IS THE DOCTOR WITHIN THE CRADLE IN THAT POSITION 
THIS IS THE BIT WHERE YOU'RE GOING DOWN AND IT STOPS 
IF IT STOPS WHICH WAY DO WE GO 
UM IF YOU GO THAT WAY AND DAVID GOES THAT WAY 
ACTION 
OOH 
CUT 
ARE WE GOING FROM WHAT WE'VE JUST DONE 
SO WE'D BE DOWN THERE 
GO BANG WHOA AND THEN GET BACK UP 
AND THEN DO THE WHOLE RIGHT 
HERE WE GO 
AND ACTION 
STOP 
HOLD ON 
HOLD ON WE CAN GET IN THROUGH THE WINDOW 
SMASH IT THEN 
IT'LL BE ON ANOTHER SHOT IT MIGHT AS WELL BE MADE OF CHOCOLATE 
ONE OF THOSE CHOCOLATE TOOL BOXES 
I MEAN THERE ARE MOMENTS WHERE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO VISUALISE 
QUITE WHAT IT IS THEY ARE NEEDING BUT YOU HAVE TO TRUST THAT JAMES KNOWS WHAT HE NEEDS 
TO GLUE THE SEQUENCE TOGETHER 
HAVE A SMASH OH YES OH YES 
AND THEN STOP SMASHING 
THE METAL CABLE STARTS TO BURN LIKE AN OXYACETYLENE TORCH 
THE CABLE IS FRAYING BOTH LOOK UP 
CUTTING THE CABLE 
WHEN THE CRADLE WAS LOWERED DOWN THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO BE IN IT 
I WAS DESPERATE TO GO DOWN THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING I QUITE LIKE A BIT OF HEIGHT 
AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE QUITE FUN 
BUT I SUPPOSE I'M NOT THE PERSON WHO HAS TO ANSWER TO THE INSURERS 
WHEN AN ACTOR FALLS TO THEIR DEATH DOWN THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING 
SO I AFTER JUST SURRENDER TO THOSE WHOSE JOB WOULD BE ON THE LINE WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS LIKE THAT 
WITH THE ACTUAL DESCEND IN THE CRADLE DAVE AND CATHERINE 
DID THE UP HERE STUFF ON THE ROOF DAVID WOULD PROBABLY DO IT ANYWAY 
BUT FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY INSURANCE HE IS NOT ALLOWED TO SO WE GET A TWO STUNT PERFORMERS 
CAN YOU DO AN ODD LOOK DOWN 
AND GORDON DAVID'S DOUBLE HAS ALSO HAD A LITTLE COURSE ON HOW TO OPERATE THE CRADLE 
SO YEAH THE STUNT PEOPLE ON THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING WHICH WILL TIE IN US 
ON THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING THERE IS A LOT OF GREEN SCREEN WHICH WILL TIE IN 
IT WASN'T PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE FOR US TO DROP THE CRADLE OFF THE SIDE OF A REAL BUILDING 
SO WHEN WE BROKE IT DOWN INTO THE SHOTS WE NEEDED TO TELL THE STORY 
WE FELT WE COULD ACHIEVE THEM WITH MORE CONTROL 
MAKE THEM MORE EXCITING BY DOING THEM AS AFFECTS SHOTS 
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME WE'VE BEEN ON THE CRADLE BUT NOW WE ARE ON A GREEN SCREEN 
SO WE ARE IN THE STUDIO 
AND DAVID IS MAKING IT GO EVEN MORE 
I'M STANDING HERE 
THE WHOLE ELEMENT OF DAVID HAVING TO CATCH THE SONIC PEN 
WAS ONE OF THE TRICKIEST THINGS BECAUSE HE WAS ON A GREEN SCREEN 
HE HAD TO LEAN OUT AND CATCH WHAT IS SO VERY SMALL PROP IN HIS HAND 
HERE WE GO 
ACTION 
CUT THERE 
THAT WAS BRILLIANT 
GOOD THROW 
IT'S THE ONLY ONE THOUGH 
I HOPE WE GOT THAT BECAUSE THAT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN 
AMAZING AS THAT WAS IN MANY WAYS WE'LL JUST HAVE ONE MORE GO 
THE CATCHING WAS JUST SLIGHTLY OUT OF FRAME 
YOU ARE KIDDING ME 
JUST SLIGHTLY 
I CAUGHT THAT PUPPY 
THE ACTUAL STUNT OF THE CABLES SNAPPING AND CATHERINE FALLING OUT OF IT 
WAS SHOT ENTIRELY WITH STUNT DOUBLES 
THE KEY THING WITH MOST STUNTS IS TO TRY AND MAKE THEM BELIEVE IT IS REALLY THE CHARACTER DOING THEM 
O. K. THREE TWO ONE ACTION 
O. K. GOOD WELL DONE 
I THINK THE FIRST TAKE WE DID THE STUNT JO WHO'S A BRILLIANT STUNT PERFORMER 
SHE KIND OF DIVED OUT OF THE BUCKET WHICH LOOKED AMAZINGLY DRAMATIC 
BUT PERHAPS DOESN'T REALLY REFLECT WHAT THE REALITY WOULD BE IF IT WAS YOU AND I IN A BUCKET 
SO IN THE SECOND ONE WE SLOWED IT DOWN SO SHE MORE SORT OF FELL OUT 
AND IT LOOKED MORE AWKWARD BUT IT LOOKED MORE REAL 
THREE TWO ONE ACTION 
THE DOCTOR REACHES OUT FOR BUT MISSING DONNA TUMBLING OVER THE EDGE SCREAMING 
THE DOCTOR SLAMS INTO WHAT WAS THE WALL AND NOW IS THE FLOOR OF THE CRADLE TO SEE 
DONNA AND SHE IS HANGING ONTO A CABLE 
IF YOU ARE AN INSPIRING WRITER TAKE THAT WINDOW CLEANER'S CRADLE SEQUENCE FROM BEGINNING TO END 
AND TRY TO WRITE IT OUT ON PAPER DESCRIBING EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS CLEARLY WITH NO MISUNDERSTANDING 
WHAT'S LEFT WHAT'S RIGHT WHEN THE WINCH CONTROLS BREAK 
WHEN THE STOP BUTTON IS WORKING WHAT BLOWS UP WHICH SIDE WHERE AND AT WHICH POINT MISS FOSTER CROSSES OVER 
IT IS A HUGELY HUGELY TECHNICAL EXERCISE THAT DOCTOR WHO HAS TAUGHT ALL OF US HOW TO DO HOW TO WRITE 
I AM GOING TO DO A WRITER'S CLASS SIT PEOPLE DOWN AND SAY 
DESCRIBE THAT SEQUENCE SO THAT IT CANNOT BE DONE IN ANY DIFFERENT WAY IT IS REALLY TRICKY 
IT HAS BEEN PULLED OFF BEAUTIFULLY 
ON A HILLSIDE WE SEE DONNA TRUDGING UP AND THERE'S HER DAD GEOFF 
SITTING ON A CAMPING CHAIR WITH A TELESCOPE NICE AMATEUR ASTRONOMER ALL NICE AND QUIET 
BRINGING DONNA BACK WE ARE BRINGING BACK HER FAMILY AS WELL 
WE FIND OURSELVES IN A SAD SITUATION WHERE A LOVELY ACTOR HOWARD ATTFIELD 
WHO PLAYED DONNA'S FATHER VERY ILL AND WE DID BRING HIM BACK FOR SOME FILMING 
BUT HIS ILLNESS THE EXTENT OF HIS ILLNESS BECAME OBVIOUS TO US AND TO HIM ACTUALLY 
AND SADLY HE DIED SOON AFTERWARDS 
WHICH IS VERY SAD AND A LOVELY MAN AND LOVELY ACTOR AS WELL 
AYE AYE HERE COMES TROUBLE 
PERMISSION TO BOARD SHIP SIR 
WAS SHE NAGGING YOU YES 
BROUGHT YOU A THERMOS AND A MARS BAR 
SEEN ANYTHING 
I'VE GOT VENUS WITH AN APPARENT MAGNITUDE OF MINUS THREE POINT FIVE 
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS IN MY BOOK COME AND SEE 
WE DIDN'T WANT TO RECAST THE FATHER I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE 
AN INSULT IN A WAY TO THE MEMORY AND NOT FAIR 
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WOULD HAVE FELT COMFORTABLE WITH A NEW MAN PLAYING DONNA'S FATHER 
HOW FAR AWAY IS THAT 
ABOUT TWENTY SIX MILLION MILES 
LATER EPISODES HE IS REMEMBERED THEY MENTION THE FATHER HE IS REMEMBERED NICELY WITH DIGNITY 
WE WILL GET THERE ONE DAY 
ONE HUNDRED YEARS' TIME WE'LL BE STRIDING AMONGST THE STARS JUST YOU WAIT 
SO THE WE THEN DECIDED WE WERE GOING TO WRITE IN DONNA'S GRANDAD 
WE HAVE A NEW FAMILY DYNAMIC MOVING ON AND IT IS A GREAT FAMILY 
THE GREAT THING ABOUT NEW DOCTOR WHO HAS BEEN THE WAY THAT I THINK 
THE COMPANIONS TO THE DOCTOR HAVE HAD HOME LIVES AND A WORLD OF THEIR OWN REALLY 
THAT WE CAN KEEP GOING BACK TO AND KEEP REMINDING THE AUDIENCE OF 
AND I THINK THIS IS YOU KNOW ANOTHER TURN OF THE WHEEL 
HELLO 
IT'S LOVELY HERE WHERE'S THE FOOD 
IT'S FAMILY AFFAIR IT'S A FAMILY AFFAIR 
ANOTHER COMPANION MEANS A WHOLE NEW FAMILY AFFAIR 
CONFIDENTIAL TAKES A PEEK AT DONNA'S HOME LIFE AND INVITES YOU TO MEET THE NOBLES 
BERNARD CAN I TAKE YOU AWAY FOR A RADIO MIC SIR A RADIO MIC 
THIS IS THE MOST EXCITING THING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME THIS MORNING 
STUNNING 
THE NICE THING ABOUT DONNA'S FAMILY IS IT DEMONSTRATES 
THAT SHE'S SOMEBODY WHO'S PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT STUCK IN HER LIFE 
AND HER MOTHER WHO MEANS TERRIBLY WELL IS SLIGHTLY OVERBEARING 
AND YOU KNOW QUITE ASPIRATIONAL AND WANTS TO BETTER HERSELF THINKS DONNA SHOULD BETTER HERSELF 
THAT'S SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN IDENTIFY WITH WITH THEIR FAMILIES 
LOOK AT YOU YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO FIND A FLAT ON THE DOLE 
IT'S NO GOOD SITTING THERE DRESSED UP LOOKING LIKE YOU'RE JOB HUNTING YOU HAVE GOT TO DO SOMETHING 
THE DYNAMIC THAT HAS HAPPENED IS SHE HAS HAD TO MOVE BACK FROM 
SHE HAS HAD TO MOVE BACK HOME AND IT IS A VERY FRACTIOUS MOTHER DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIP 
LIKE ANY MOTHER I HAVE HOPES AND AMBITIONS FOR HER AND SHE SEEMS TO BE GOING FROM JOB TO JOB TO JOB 
IT'S NOT LIKE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES NO ONE IS UNEMPLOYED THESE DAYS EXCEPT YOU 
YOU HAVE MY FAVOURITE THING MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS SNIPING AT EACH OTHER 
ALL MOTHER AND DAUGHTERS SNIPE AT EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME 
AS FAR AS SYLVIA IS CONCERNED 
SHE HAS A DAUGHTER THAT'S HAD AN UNSUCCESSFUL RELATIONSHIP 
AND ISN'T GETTING WORK AND NEEDS SUPPORT AND HAS MOVED BACK HOME 
SO INSTEAD OF SHOWING THAT IN A LOVING SUPPORTIVE WAY I GET VERY IRRITATED WITH HER 
HOW LONG DID THAT JOB WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY LAST TWO DAYS 
AND THEN YOU WALK OUT 
I HAVE OTHER PLANS 
WELL I'VE NOT SEEN THEM SHE IS THE KIND OF WOMAN THAT WILL FIND FAULT 
IT'S NO GOOD SITTING THEIR DREAMING NO ONE IS GOING TO COME ALONG WITH A MAGIC WAND TO MAKE YOUR LIFE BETTER 
YOU CAN'T TURN ROUND AND SAY ACTUALLY I HAVE THIS GRAND PLAN 
I AM GOING TO SEEK OUT THIS GREAT ALIEN THAT I MET ONCE 
AND HE IS GOING TO TAKE ME ROUND THE UNIVERSE YOU KNOW 
WHERE'S GRANDAD 
WHERE DO THINK HE IS UP THE HILL HE'S ALWAYS UP THE HILL 
ACTION 
AYE AYE HERE COMES TROUBLE WAS SHE NAGGING YOU 
BIG TIME 
BROUGHT YOU A THERMOS OH TA 
AND BERNARD CRIBBINS HAD APPEARED IN OUR CHRISTMAS SPECIAL 
LONDON AT CHRISTMAS NOT SAFE IS IT 
I THINK WE LOOKED AT THAT AND THOUGHT WHY NOT CAPITALISE ON IT AND BRING HIM BACK 
YOU SEEN ANYTHING YEAH I'VE GOT VENUS WITH AN APPARENT MAGNITUDE OF MINUS THREE POINT FIVE AT LEAST 
THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS IN MY LITTLE BOOK 
HERE COME AND SEE COME ON HERE YOU GO 
HE FILLS THE ROLE THAT DONNA'S DAD WOULD HAVE FILLED 
THAT KIND OF CONFIDANTE FOR HER THE PERSON WHO KNOWS THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT SHE'S DOING 
BUT DOESN'T LET ON THE PERSON WHO ENCOURAGES HER REALLY IN MANY WAYS TO LOOK TO THE STARS 
TO LOOK OUT THERE AT HOW WONDERFUL LIFE CAN BE 
TWO THOUSAND FIFTY TAKE TWO A AND B. COMMON BOARD ACTION 
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'VE SEEN A LITTLE BLUE BOX 
IS THAT SLANG FOR SOMETHING 
NO 
I MEAN IT 
IF YOU LEAD AS I THINK SHE FELT SHE DID LEAD 
A VERY BANAL MUNDANE SAME OLD SAME OLD KIND OF LIFE 
WHY WOULDN'T YOU GO WITH THIS DAZZLING DOCTOR 
IF YOU EVER SEE A LITTLE BLUE BOX FLYING UP THERE IN THE SKY JUST SHOUT FOR ME GRAMPS 
OH YOU JUST SHOUT 
OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW CATHERINE TATE AS A GREAT COMIC ACTOR 
SO YOU'VE GOT ALL THAT COMING OUT OF THE SCRIPT BECAUSE PEOPLE KNOW THEY'RE WRITING FOR HER 
AND ALSO THE WAY SHE'LL TURN A LINE WILL KEEP SURPRISING YOU 
AND THEN SHE'LL SURPRISE YOU AGAIN BY FULFILLING ALL THE EMOTIONAL MOMENTS POWERFULLY AS WELL 
SHE SEEMS TO HAVE A VALVE THAT TAPS RIGHT INTO HER SOUL AND INTO THE SOUL OF DONNA 
IT'S JUST 
THE THINGS I'VE SEEN SOMETIMES I THINK I'M GOING MAD 
I MEAN EVEN TONIGHT I WAS IN A. 
IT DOESN'T MATTER NO YOU'RE NOT YOURSELF I'LL GIVE YOU THAT 
YOU JUST SEEM TO BE DRIFTING SWEETHEART 
I'M NOT DRIFTING 
I'M WAITING 
WHAT FOR 
THE RIGHT MAN 
IT'S THE SAME OLD STORY A MAN 
NO I DON'T MEAN LIKE THAT 
BUT HE'S REAL I'VE SEEN HIM 
I'VE MET HIM JUST ONCE 
AND THEN I LET HIM FLY AWAY THERE YOU ARE GO AND FIND HIM 
I'VE TRIED 
HE'S NOWHERE O. I. 
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU TO GIVE UP 
WHERE HAS SHE GONE 
WHERE'S THAT GIRL EH 
YOU'RE RIGHT BECAUSE HE'S STILL OUT THERE 
SOMEWHERE 
AND I'LL FIND HIM 
EVEN IF I HAVE TO WAIT ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
I'LL FIND HIM 
ADIPOSE INDUSTRIES THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WAY TO LOSE WEIGHT 
AND HERE IT IS 
ONE CAPSULE ONCE A DAY FOR THREE WEEKS AND THE FAT AS THEY SAY 
THE FAT JUST WALKS AWAY 
THE ADIPOSE ARE FAT LIVING FAT 
FUNNY AS I GET MIDDLE AGED AND SPREAD I WRITE STORIES LIKE THIS 
BUT IT'S LIKE I THINK I WANTED A MONSTER THAT 
WE'VE DONE BIG SCARY FANG MONSTERS WE'D DONE WEREWOLVES WE'VE DONE A LAZARUS MONSTER 
AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND I'M SURE WE WILL AGAIN 
BUT YOU LOOK AT WHAT C. G. I. IS DOING THESE DAYS AND WE'VE NEVER DONE BIG CROWD REPLICATION MONSTERS 
LIKE BUGS OR THINGS LIKE THAT AND I JUST WANTED SOMETHING A BIT MORE BIZARRE AND SURREAL AND PUPPETY 
THERE'S A CUTENESS TO THEM THEY'RE FUNNY BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'RE FUNNY THEY'RE MACABRE 
UP YOU GO BABIES 
I'M WAVING AT FAT 
IT'S A NICE IDEA ISN'T IT THAT YOU TAKE A PILL TO TRANSFORM YOUR LIFE'S WOES 
THAT YOU CAN HAVE AS MUCH CHOCOLATE CAKE AS YOU COULD EVER WISH FOR 
AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE YOU COULD JUST TAKE A PILL AND BE RID OF IT 
WHAT'S NICE ABOUT THE WHOLE ADIPOSE THING IS IT'S NOT ACTUALLY THAT BAD 
IF IT WORKED IT'S A WIN WIN SITUATION FOR EVERYONE REALLY 
YEAH THE MATRON SHOULDN'T BE DOING IT AND THERE'S THE DANGEROUS SIDE EFFECTS 
THAT IF IT ALL GOES WRONG IT DESTROYS YOU UTTERLY 
BUT WHEN YOU SEE THE CHARACTERS FOR WHOM IT'S WORKING THEY'RE RATHER PLEASED ABOUT IT 
I FEEL FANTASTIC IT'S A NEW LEASE OF LIFE 
ONE OF THE CHARACTERS' ENTIRE BODY GETS ABSORBED BY THEM 
SO WHAT THEY DO IS QUITE SCARY 
BACK IN STACEY'S BATHROOM SHE'S BOGGLING LOOKING DOWN AS HER SKIN STRETCHES OUT 
ACTUALLY BREAKING THROUGH NO BROKEN SKIN OR BLOOD 
INSTEAD THE SKIN IS WIDENING AND DIVIDING OFF AND A LUMP PLOPS FREE WITH STACEY STANDING BY THE SINK 
IT PLOPS INTO THE BOWL THEN THE STOMACH TWANGS BACK TO NORMAL AND THE LUMP IS AN ADIPOSE 
STANDING IN THE SINK BOWL WITH LITTLE ARMS AND LEGS LITTLE BLACK DOTS LITTLE MEWLING MOUTH 
INCOHERENT JEST I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT HIM YOU SHOULD SEE IT IT'S MARVELLOUS 
LIKE A SOFT TOY SIMPLY WAVING LITTLE STUMPY ARMS AND STACEY'S JUST BOGGLING 
WHAT ARE YOU 
OH 
FOR THE SEQUENCES WHERE THE ADIPOSE ARE MOVING UNDER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES 
WE TALKED LONG AND HARD ABOUT HOW WE WERE GOING TO ACHIEVE THEM 
AND BASICALLY ANY EFFECTS CAME UP WITH THIS SORT OF BLADDER SYSTEM 
SO THE ACTORS WORE A SORT OF CORSET UNDERNEATH THEIR CLOTHES 
INTO WHICH WERE STITCHED BLADDERS WITH AIR LINES COMING AWAY 
SO AN EFFECTS TECHNICIAN WOULD BASICALLY PUSH BUTTONS THAT BLEW AIR INTO AND INFLATED THESE BLADDERS 
AT VARIOUS POINTS ON PEOPLE'S BODY 
BUILDING THE MECHANICS BEHIND THAT BULGING FAT 
WAS A CHALLENGE THE EFFECTS TEAM RELISHED GETTING THEIR TEETH INTO 
BIG GIRL BY MIKA 
WHAT ARE YOU 
WHAT ARE YOU 
AH 
STACEY 
YOU ALL RIGHT 
WHAT IS IT WHAT'S WRONG THE DOOR IS LOCKED AND STACEY IS STRUGGLING WITH THE BUMPS 
HELP ME OH MY GOD HELP ME 
DONNA IS THUMPING AT THE DOOR 
STACEY STACEY 
AGH H. H. H. 
IN A SECOND SHE'S GONE HER WHOLE BODY DIVIDES INTO SEPARATE PIECES 
TWENTY SEPARATE ADIPOSE PLOP TUMBLING TO THE FLOOR IN AMONGST HER FALLING EMPTY CLOTHES 
WE SEE ON THE FLOOR A NUMBER OF ADIPOSE WADDLING ABOUT HEADING FOR THE WALLS 
DONNA HEARS SOMETHING LISTENS A GIGGLING SCURRYING NOISE SHE SHOVES AT THE DOOR HARD 
AND LET GO 
THE DOOR FLIES OPEN SHE STANDS THERE SHE SEES THE CLOTHES ON THE FLOOR 
AND THERE ON THE WINDOWSILL ONE LITTLE ADIPOSE GIVE'S DONNA A LITTLE WAVE 
BYE BYE IT HOPS OUT THE WINDOW GONE 
THEY WERE COMPLETELY C. G. I. CREATIONS SO WE HAD NOTHING ON THE SET TO SHOOT 
ALTHOUGH THE ART DEPARTMENT DID MAKE A WOOLLY ONE SO WE HAD A FEW WOOLLY PRETEND ONES 
AND THESE 
ARE MY CHILDREN 
SHE'S MAKING LITTLE ADIPOSIAN BABIES OUT OF 
HUMAN FAT 
AND THEY'RE LOVELY 
IT'S QUITE SWEET ISN'T IT 
VERY SWEET HE'S GOT LITTLE BUM CHEEKS ON HIS BACK HE HAS 
THEY'RE QUITE NICE AND THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A FANG 
MISS FOSTER WAS IT'S NOT WITHOUT REASON DONNA CALLS HER SUPERNANNY 
THAT'S WHERE THE COSTUME CAME FROM AND THE GLASSES AND EVERYTHING 
BECAUSE EVERYONE LATCHED ONTO THAT AND SAID SHE'S SUPERNANNY SLASH SPACE VILLAIN 
JUST PERFECT CASTING YOU OFFER IT TO SARAH LANCASHIRE AND YOU HOPE SHE'LL SAY YES AND WE GOT HER 
AND SHE CAME DOWN WHICH IS WONDERFUL 
ACCORDING TO MY OLDER BOYS IT'S THE COOLEST THING EVER 
PROBABLY THE COOLEST THING I'VE EVER DONE 
AT LAST 
WHAT SARAH DOES BRILLIANTLY SHE DOESN'T JUST LOOK A BIT LIKE SUPERNANNY 
BUT SHE DOES WHAT THE PERFECT NANNY DOES WHICH IS TO BE ABSOLUTELY CALM AND POISED AND UNFLAPPABLE 
SIT THERE I'M PHONING MY EDITOR I SAID SIT 
YOU KNOW THAT SUPREME CHILLING CALM THAT THEY PROJECT THAT REALLY UNNERVES YOU 
SHE DOES THAT SHE TAKES THAT NANNY AND UPS IT INTO VILLAIN LEVEL 
WHAT SORT OF A COUNTRY DO YOU THINK THIS IS IT'S A BEAUTIFULLY FAT COUNTRY 
BELIEVE ME I'VE TRAVELLED A LONG WAY TO FIND OBESITY ON THIS SCALE 
SHE'S BEEN EMPLOYED BY THE ADIPOSIAN FAMILY 
TO BREED A NEW GENERATION OF LITTLE ADIPOSIANS 
OUTSIDE ADIPOSTE INDUSTRIES MISS FOSTER STRIDES OUT STANDS THERE TRIUMPHANT LIKE EVA PERON 
CHILDREN 
OH MY CHILDREN BEHOLD 
I AM TAKING YOU HOME WE REVEAL THE STREETS ARE NOW FILLED WITH HUNDREDS OF ADIPOSTES ALL GOING YEAH 
FAR ACROSS THE GALAXY YOUR NEW MUMMIES AND DADDIES ARE WAITING AND YOU WILL FLY 
SHE GESTURES UP AND WHAM STRONG WIDE BLUISH BEAMS OF LIGHT SHAFT DOWN FROM THE SPACESHIP 
UP YOU GO BABIES UP YOU GO 
A BUNCH OF ADIPOSTES LIFTING UP IN THE BEAM OF LIGHT 
THEN HUNDREDS OF ADIPOSTES ALL LIFTING UP FROM THE STREETS 
THAT'S IT FLY AWAY HOME 
AND ON THE ROOFTOP THE DOCTOR AND DONNA BURST OUT AND STOP AWESTRUCK 
SEEING THE ADIPOSTES THE AIR GLOWING WITH BEAM LIGHT AS HUNDREDS OF DOT SIZED CREATURES RISE UP 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO THEN BLOW THEM UP 
THEY'RE JUST CHILDREN THEY CAN'T HELP WHERE THEY CAME FROM 
OVER HERE WE HAVE THE DOCTOR AND DONNA 
LOOKING OUT AT ALL OF THE ADIPOSTES AS THEY LIFT UP INTO THE AIR 
WITH THESE HUGE SORT OF BIG BLUE BEAMS 
THEY SHOULD USE A DIET PLAN IT SORT OF WORKS THERE SHE IS 
CUT THERE O. K. WALK AWAY CLEAN PLATE PLEASE 
AND WE CAN WALK AWAY STILL RUNNING THANK YOU GUYS CLEAN PLATE HERE 
OH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN 
AND THEN ONCE WE HAVE GOT A NICE FOREGROUND WITH THE DOCTOR AND DONNA 
WE CAN THEN BRING IN OUR EFFECTS 
SO FOR OUR EFFECTS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE 
POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF LITTLE ADIPOSTES THAT ARE FLYING UP 
SO EACH ONE IS GOING TO WITH A BIT OF LUCK HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF DIFFERENT ANIMATION 
WE HAVE ACTUALLY GOT SOFTWARE WE'RE HOPING TO UTILISE FOR THIS 
AND FOR MOST OF OUR ADIPOSTE SHOTS WHEN THERE ARE MANY OF THEM 
WHICH WILL SORT OF ARTIFICIALLY LIKE AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
WILL TRY AND DO SEPARATE MOVES FOR THEM 
SO WE DON'T HAVE AN ANIMATOR TRYING TO ANIMATE MOVES FOR HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS ADIPOSTES 
SO HOPEFULLY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE OUR ADIPOSTES ALL FLYING UP IN 
MAYBE ABOUT SIX DIFFERENT BEAMS OF LIGHT 
A SORT OF BLUISH LIGHT COMING TOWARDS US 
AND THEN AT A CERTAIN POINT 
WE'LL HAVE SEVERAL SHOTS LIKE THAT A CLOSE UP AND A MEDIUM WIDE SHOT 
AND THEN AT A CERTAIN POINT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE NANNY COMING UP 
AND WE'LL SEE HER WITH SOME ADIPOSTES IN THE FOREGROUND 
SOME ADIPOSTES IN THE BACKGROUND 
FLOATING INTO SHOT ON HER LEVITATION BEAM 
AND ACTION MATRON LISTEN TO ME 
NO I DON'T THINK SO DOCTOR 
AND WHATEVER 
WHATEVER I SAY NEXT REALLY 
KEEP ROLLING DO YOU WANT A REMINDER ARE YOU ALL RIGHT NO I'M FINE AND ACTION 
MATRON LISTEN TO ME 
I DON'T THINK SO DOCTOR IF I NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IT WILL BE TOO SOON 
WHY DOES NOBODY LISTEN CAN YOU SHIFT THE LEVITATION BEAM WHAT SO YOU CAN ARREST ME 
LISTEN I SAW THE ADIPOSIAN INSTRUCTIONS 
THEY KNOW IT'S A CRIME BREEDING ON EARTH SO WHAT'S THE ONE THING THEY WANT RID OF THEIR ACCOMPLICE 
I AM FAR MORE THAN THAT 
I'M NANNY TO ALL THESE CHILDREN 
EXACTLY MUM AND DAD HAVE GOT THE KIDS NOW THEY DON'T NEED THE NANNY ANYMORE 
LIGHTS 
DROP 
IT'S A NICE DIFFERENT TYPE OF STORY BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE MATRON IS A BIT OF A BADDIE 
IT'S NOT THAT STRAIGHTFORWARD 
AND THERE IS QUITE A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HUMANS AND THE ADIPOSIANS 
IF ONLY IT WAS WORKING OUT A BIT SMOOTHER THAN IT IS 
I SUPPOSE YOU CAN WONDER WHETHER SHE IS DOING HER JOB OR NOT 
THE REAL VILLAINS ARE THE ADIPOSE FAMILY OFF STAGE 
WHO ARE SEEDING PLANET EARTH SHE'S ABSOLUTELY A VILLAIN THOUGH 
I MEAN LOVELY STACEY THINK OF STACEY SHE SITS AT HOME SHE'S GOING OUT ON A DATE SHE'S HAPPY 
SHE'S LOST WEIGHT SHE'S A LOVELY WOMAN IN HER OWN HOUSE AND SHE DIES IN HER BATHROOM SPLITTING INTO FAT 
IT IS A TERRIBLE DEATH MISS FOSTER DESERVES EVERYTHING THAT IS COMING TO HER 
I THINK SHE IS A GOODY BY THE WAY I DON'T THINK SHE'S A BADDIE 
IF SHE IS A BADDIE MAYBE WE'RE SAYING THINGS FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE 
BUT I HAVE PERSUADED MYSELF THAT SHE IS QUITE A NICE LADY 
BACK TO IT 
SO THEN TARDIS COME ON 
SO WHOLE WIDE UNIVERSE

WHICH IS 
TWO MILES THAT WAY

GO ON GIRL 
GO ON GET UP THERE 
HEY 
IT'S JUST THE JOY OF SOMEBODY BEING ABLE TO TRAVEL OFF IN TIME AND SPACE TO SEE THAT BY HER GRANDFATHER 
ONE OF MY FAVOURITE THINGS WE'VE DONE 
HE DOESN'T RESENT THAT HE DOESN'T ENVY HER 
HE STANDS THERE AND CHEERS AND WAVES HER OFF AND SAYS GO GET IT GIRL AND GRAB IT 
AND DO WHAT I NEVER DID 
AND THEN SUDDENLY AT THE END OF THIS EPISODE 
DONNA NOBLE THE HAPPIEST MOMENT OF HER LIFE RUNS UP TO A BLONDE WOMEN IN THE CROWD AND IT IS ROSE TYLER 
LISTEN THIS WOMAN COMES ALONG TALL BLONDE WOMAN CALLED SYLVIA
