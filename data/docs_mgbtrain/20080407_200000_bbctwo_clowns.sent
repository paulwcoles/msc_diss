THE REST OF IT'S ALL PRETTY NORMAL CLOTHES REALLY 
GOT A RATHER SCARY HOLE IN THE CROTCH BECAUSE 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOMEN DO WHO ARE MY SIZE OR BIGGER WHEN THEY WANT TIGHTS 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GET TIGHTS MADE FOR PEOPLE MY SIZE

FOR IT'S HARD YOU WILL FIND 
TO BE NARROW OF MIND 
IF YOU'RE YOUNG AT HEART 
WHEN I WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN I THOUGHT OH DEAR 
I KNEW I JUST WASN'T LIKE OTHER PEOPLE MY CHILDHOOD WAS HELL 
I DIDN'T LIKE MY CHILDHOOD COS I WENT TO FOURTEEN SCHOOLS 
MY FATHER WAS A RAGING ALCOHOLIC 
MY MOTHER WAS A COMPLETE JESUS FREAK 
HE WAS ACTUALLY THE WORST ALCOHOLIC I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED 
YOU SEE THE GUYS ON THE STREETS DRINKING WHITE LIGHTNING AT NINE IN THE MORNING 
MY FATHER WOULD PUT THAT TO SHAME 
WHEN I WAS SEVEN THE WHOLE FAMILY JUST WENT 
IT WASN'T A FAMILY ANY MORE 
I JUST THOUGHT WELL I DON'T WANT TO EVER BE IN A RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS GOING TO END THAT WAY 
I'D RATHER NOT BE IN A RELATIONSHIP AT ALL THAN WITH SOMEBODY I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH 
I GUESS I'M THE ULTIMATE ROMANTIC AND IT'S HARD TO FIND YOUR ROMANTIC GIRL THESE DAYS 
MOST GIRLS DON'T GIVE ME ENOUGH TIME TO GET TO KNOW THEM 
ONE THING THAT GIRLS SHOULD LOOK OUT FOR IF YOU WANT TO FIND A ROMANTIC MAN 
YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW HIM BEFORE HE'S GOING TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU 
OTHERWISE IT'S A JOKE 
YEAH THESE ARE SUPERFAST ROLLERBLADES 
THERE YOU GO ROBERT MUGABE 
THIS IS THE BOX OF MAGIC TRICKS BUT YOU DIDN'T HEAR THAT MAXI

OH IT WENT UP MY NOSE 
IF YOU'VE GOT A FAT MAN DRESSED AS A CLOWN IN FRONT OF THEM THERE'S NO RULES 
I MEAN IF THAT'S THE TEACHER 
IT'S ALL OFF THE RULES ARE OFF 
THE THING IS WHATEVER PARTY YOU DO YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW 
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND EACH PARTY'S DIFFERENT VERY VERY DIFFERENT 
UNTIL YOU GET THERE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CHILDREN WILL BE LIKE 
THE MAJORITY OF THREES FOURS AND FIVE YEAR OLDS THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD 
WHEN THEY REACH SIX THEY CHANGE 
THEY'RE NOT SO FORGIVING IF YOU GET THE TRICKS WRONG 
I'M ALWAYS GETTING IT WRONG 
DON'T INTERRUPT ME 
WHEN YOU PUT KIDS IN A ROOM THEY CHANGE BECAUSE THEY GET COURAGE 
OF A SUDDEN BECOME THE RINGLEADER 
OF A GANG OF SAVAGE THUGS AVERAGE AGE FIVE 
YOU CAN SEE THEM CHANGE AND IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT PARENTS AROUND 
I'M NOT A CHILDMINDER I'M A CHILDREN'S ENTERTAINER 
BUT THE AMOUNT OF TIMES I TURN UP AT PARTIES AND ALL THE PARENTS ARE IN THE KITCHEN PIMM'S 
YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAY THAT CHILDREN GROW UP TOO QUICKLY 
WELL WHY DO THEY THINK CHILDREN GROW UP TOO QUICKLY 
IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE PRESSURE PUT ON THEM TO GROW UP QUICKLY 
WHO IS THIS MAN

HMM HMM NO CHEAPER CAR INSURANCE 
YOU'RE SPONSORED BY ADMIRAL 
WE'LL SPEND THE LAST TEN MINUTES I'LL MAKE YOU ALL A MAGIC BALLOON 
AND THEN I'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO MY NICE PADDED ROOM 
USUALLY AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAT I LIKE TO DO THAN OBLIVIATE MYSELF 
IN FRONT OF A LARGE AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL AND FAGS 
COS I'M JUST SO KNACKERED REALLY DRAINED 
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU'LL KEEP THIS UP FOR 
FOR ABOUT ANOTHER THREE YEARS I RECKON 
THREE OR FOUR YEARS I SAID FIVE YEARS 
SO YEAH ANOTHER FOUR YEARS 
THREE HUNDRED QUID THREE HUNDRED QUID 
CHEERS ALL RIGHT 
I'LL SEND SOMEONE ROUND TO PUT IT ON THE MORTGAGE BYE BYE MARLON 
I HAVE THE NUMBER OF A GOOD THERAPIST IF YOU NEED IT 
HE'LL NEED IT AFTER THIS 
ANYBODY GOT A LIGHT NO SORRY YOU DON'T SMOKE NO COURSE NOT 
WHAT KIND OF KIDS ARE YOU NOWADAYS NOT GOOD ENOUGH YOU FREAKS 
OH RIGHT 
SAY SILLY BILLY SILLY BILLY 
SAY GET THE CREAM GET THE CREAM 
SHATTERED 
I TELL YOU MY THROAT IS JUST STARTING TO GO A LITTLE BIT NOW 
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TAKE ANY MORE CUSTARD PIES IN THE FACE THIS YEAR 
I'VE HAD ABOUT A THOUSAND OF THEM 
AND THE LIPS START TO GO A BIT DRY YOU KNOW RIGHT 
PACK THESE BITS AWAY NOW 
I'M QUITE A QUIET PERSON OUTSIDE OF THIS INDUSTRY 
I'M NOT AS HYPER AS I AM HERE BUT I PROBABLY LET IT ALL GO WHEN I'M DOING MY SHOWS 
SO THERE IS THAT OTHER SIDE TO MR. PUMPKIN 
I LOVE TO DIG ALL THE DAY 
AND FINDING TREASURE IS A JOY I CAN'T EXPRESS 
THE KIDS HAVE TO LIKE YOU 
IF THE KIDS DON'T LIKE YOU YOU'RE IN BIG BIG BIG TROUBLE 
WHEN I SEE THAT TREASURE CHEST 
ARE YOU GOING TO STOP BLOWING ON YOUR BLOWERS 
NO O. K. WE'LL PUT MUSIC ON COS YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH SINGING NOW 
I FINISHED THE SONGS EARLY COS THEY WERE BLOWING THOSE BLOWER THINGS 
IT'S KIND OF POINTLESS 
COS I CAN'T CONCENTRATE AND THE KIDS CAN'T REALLY HEAR 
WHAT I'M SINGING ANYWAY WITH ALL THAT NOISE GOING ON 
IN THIS GAME YOU CAN SEE HOW IF YOUR ATTITUDE TO PERFORMING CHANGES 
THAT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS IT'S A QUESTION OF BURN OUT 
IF YOU FEEL YOURSELF BURNING OUT THERE'S THINGS YOU MUST DO 
GET TOGETHER WITH OTHER ENTERTAINERS AND TALK TAKE A BREAK READ A BOOK LEARN A NEW ROUTINE 
THERE'S THINGS YOU CAN DO BUT IF YOU'RE GETTING TO BURN OUT STAGE 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT 
AND CALLED ME MR. POOHEAD FOR FORTY MINUTES 
LOUD DIDN'T STOP MR. POOHEAD MR. POOHEAD MR. POOHEAD MR. POOHEAD 
THE REST OF THE KIDS DIDN'T CARE 
AND IT'S VERY TEMPTING THAT YOU COULD LOSE IT BUT YOU CAN'T 
YOU CAN'T LOSE IT 
BUT I'M NOT SAYING THAT EVERYBODY'S LOST THEIR TEMPER 
BUT WITH THIS JOB IF YOU LOSE YOUR TEMPER IT'S HIGH PROFILE 
YOU'D BE SURPRISED AT PEOPLE WHO DON'T ASK WHETHER YOU'RE POLICE VETTED 
I'VE PROBABLY BEEN ASKED THREE TIMES IN FIVE YEARS 
IT CAN HAPPEN TO PRETTY MUCH ANYBODY I DID HEAR OF ONE INCIDENT 
I IMAGINE HE JUST SNAPPED WAS PUSHED TOO FAR AND HAD HAD A BAD WEEK I DON'T KNOW 
THE GREAT VELCRO 
ERM OBVIOUSLY I'VE READ ABOUT HIM IN THE PAPERS 
MY FATHER IN LAW POINTED HIM OUT TO ME IN THE EVENING ARGUS 
AND THEN HE MADE THE MAIL OR WHATEVER IT IS AS WELL 
YEAH HELLO HELLO 
WHAT A SURPRISE THE GREAT VELCRO 
NOT ANY MORE I'VE LOST THAT NAME 
HAVE YOU MM IT HAD TO GO 
IS IT O. K. IF I COME IN YES YES YES MADAME 
WELL THIS IS MY FRONT ROOM WHICH IS ALSO KNOWN AS THE TIP AND ALSO KNOWN AS A MAGIC ROOM 
HOW MANY RABBITS HAVE YOU HAD 
OVER SINCE ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT FOUR 
LET ME THINK ROSITA 
GEORGINA 
ALBERT AND MILLIE 
I WORK WITH A RABBIT WHEN I KNOW IT'S SUITABLE TO WORK WITH A RABBIT 
THE CLIMATE AS SUCH HAS CHANGED 
PEOPLE ARE NOT ALWAYS UM 
SO SYMPATHETIC TO A MAGICIAN WITH A RABBIT ANY MORE 
IT'S GOT CERTAIN CONNOTATIONS 
BUT SO 
I PROBABLY AM ONE OF THE LAST GENERATION OF MAGICIANS THAT'LL USE RABBITS 
FEATHER DUSTERS 
THEY ARE MY MAGIC FLOWERS 
I CAME OUT THE NAVY LEFT SCHOOL AT FIFTEEN WHAT COULD I DO 
A BIT OF JUGGLING A BIT OF CHAT 
YEAH I SOMETIMES THINK THAT I'M NOT SUITABLE FOR THIS LINE OF WORK 
BECAUSE I HAVE GOT A TERRIBLE TEMPER 
I'VE GOT A RAGING TEMPER 
EVEN IF YOU DID LOSE IT YOU MIGHT SORT OF THINK OH GOD 
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER 
YOU'RE AN ENTERTAINER YOU'RE THERE TO MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY 
YOU KNOW THERE ARE LAWS THERE ARE PUBLIC LAWS AND THERE'S YOUR OWN LAW 
OF WHAT YOU THINK'S RIGHT AND WHAT YOU THINK'S WRONG YOU KNOW 
AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS TIE UP TOGETHER DO THEY 
ANYTHING PHYSICALLY ABUSIVE OR MENTALLY ABUSIVE TO CHILDREN IS OBVIOUSLY NOT ACCEPTABLE 
GO BACK HOME YOU KNOW 
OR GO UP ON THE DOWNS AND SCREAM AWAY YOU KNOW 
THE DEIFICATION OF KIDS HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FORTY FIFTY YEARS 
I THINK THE GREEKS OR THE ROMANS HAD ANY SORT OF THING ABOUT KIDS THEY'D CRUCIFY THEM 
YOU KNOW LITTLE SODS YOU KNOW 
DEEP DOWN I PUNISH MY KIDS 
BUT DO SOME KIDS DESERVE IT ARE THEY A PAIN IN THE BACKSIDE 
I DID A SHOW IN A PARK AND THIS KID CAME 
STARTED BEHAVING REALLY BADLY 
HE DIDN'T RELATE TO ME AT ALL HE STARTED THROWING MY STUFF AWAY AND THEN HE STARTED BEING WEIRD 
HE STARTED LOOKING AT MY BALLS GOING 
AND I THOUGHT THIS KID'S TAKING ME FOR A BIG RIDE HERE 
I THOUGHT SOD IT I'M NOT HAVING THIS 
I THOUGHT LYNN YOU'VE DONE IT NOW 
I THOUGHT YOU HAVE DONE IT I THOUGHT GOD LYNN 
THIRTY YEARS UP THE CREEK 
LOOK HOW MANY PARTIES HE'S DONE THOUSANDS OF THEM EVERYONE'S ALLOWED TO MAKE ONE MISTAKE 
IT ONLY TAKES ONE TIME 
JUST ONE SLIP AND IT COULD THEORETICALLY RUIN YOUR CAREER 
BIG DISASTER REALLY COS THEY CALLED THE POLICE AND I GOT A CAUTION 
THE KIDS WERE SHOUTING ARE YOU GOING TO GET ARRESTED ARE YOU GOING TO PRISON 
I THINK HE JUST WAS PRETTY TIRED AND HE JUST MADE THE MISTAKE OF PICKING THE WRONG PERSON 
GOOD EVENING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN

THE POLICE OFFICER SAID WE'RE GOING TO CAUTION YOU

WHEN I WAS IN THE CAR I FELT QUITE EMOTIONAL AND UPSET 
AND THE POLICEWOMAN OBVIOUSLY THE SENSITIVE ONE

THIS KID HAD JUST PUSHED THE BOUNDARY OF A SIXTY THREE YEAR OLD MAN 
WHO'S LIVED A BIT LIVED THROUGH THATCHER AND TONY BLAIR 
I'M NOT A BAD PERSON I MAY HAVE BEEN A BAD PERSON ON THAT DAY 
THAT'S ONE DAY IN SIXTY THREE YEARS 
WELL I'M NOT DANCING ROUND A HANDBAG SINGING I WILL SURVIVE 
I JUST HAD TO GET ON AND DO IT YOU KNOW 
DO YOU THINK YOU'LL NEVER DO A KID'S PARTY AGAIN 
OH I WILL DO THEM ON SPECIAL REQUEST 
IF THEY WANT A PARTICULARLY VIOLENT MAGICIAN I'LL BE THERE 
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT SAD PUT YOUR HANDS UP EVERYBODY 
SAY HOW SAD HOW SAD

WHO'S MR. PUMPKIN ME YOU 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M AFRAID MR. PUMPKIN'S GETTING A LITTLE BIT OLD EVERYBODY GO AHH AHH 
THAT'S LOVELY THANKS 
HAVE YOU BEEN A BIT LOW THEN 
WHEN I GO AND VISIT MY MUM AT THE MOMENT SHE'S VERY POORLY 
AND SO TO SEE SOMEBODY DETERIORATE IN SUCH A QUICK TIME 
ALTHOUGH SHE'S STILL ALIVE YOU'RE GRIEVING NOW 
IT'S A FORM OF GRIEF COS SHE'S NOT THAT PERSON 
SHE'S THERE BUT SHE'S NOT THE MUM THAT I USED TO KNOW 
WHO WAS A VERY HAPPY LIVELY MUM AND FULL OF LIFE 
AND 
SHE'S JUST THAT SHELL NOW AND THERE'S NO ANSWER FOR IT 
YOU KNOW SHE'S NOT GOING TO GET BETTER 
SHE'S JUST GOING TO BE ON THE DECLINE 
THEN I'M GOING FROM THAT TO A PARTY WHERE EVERYBODY'S HAPPY AND THEY EXPECT YOU 
TO SUDDENLY PUT ON THIS LOVELY MASK THAT MR. PUMPKIN MASK THAT LOVELY FACE EVERYBODY LOVES VERY HAPPY 
SO YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOU HAVE TO GO INTO LIKE AUTO DRIVE AND TURN INTO MR. PUMPKIN 
WHEN THAT DOOR OPENS BANG YOU'RE MR. PUMPKIN AND YOU HAVE TO PERFORM

THANK YOU

BRILLIANT I DON'T NORMALLY EAT THIS TO BE HONEST 
DO YOU GUYS HAVE HEALTHY FOOD THEN YEAH MUESLI 
A GRAPEFRUIT 
NOT A WHOLE ONE HALF A GRAPEFRUIT 
SPARKLING WATER 
NO COFFEE NO COFFEE NO TEA 
DON'T DRINK ANY ALCOHOL WHATSOEVER 
MR. PUMPKIN'S BODY IS A TEMPLE AS THEY SAY 
COR THAT'S GOOD COFFEE 
HOW DOES A PIRATE RETIRE 
WELL YOU CAN NEVER QUITE GET AWAY FROM BEING A PIRATE YOU KNOW 
I MEAN BASICALLY ONCE A PIRATE ALWAYS A PIRATE YEAH 
SO I'LL ALWAYS KEEP DOING STUFF TILL THE DAY I DROP 
WHAT I DON'T DO ENOUGH OF IS GO OUT TO MEET PEOPLE YOU KNOW 
THAT'S MY PROBLEM ALSO AT MY AGE I THINK WELL I DON'T REALLY WANT TO BE GOING OUT TOO MUCH 
I'D FAR RATHER HAVE A FAMILY AT HOME AND SPEND TIME WITH THEM 
SO THE PROBLEM IS WHERE DO YOU MEET PEOPLE 
IN A COUNTRY LIKE ENGLAND WHERE IT'S FREEZING COLD MOST OF THE TIME 
SEE MY CHOICE WOULD BE ON THE BEACH 
WHY ARE PEOPLE SCARED OF CLOWNS 
WHY ARE PEOPLE SCARED OF THE RUSSIANS 
WHY ARE PEOPLE SCARED OF CHAVS 
YOU KNOW IT'S THE DAILY MAIL AGAIN 
WHEN YOU WALK INTO A SHOW 
THEY DON'T KNOW YOU YOU COULD BE ANYBODY COULDN'T YOU 
I NORMALLY SAY TO THEM LOOK I'VE GOT THREE BOYS AND THAT IMMEDIATELY PUTS THEM AT EASE 
IF THEY KNOW YOU'VE GOT CHILDREN 
IT JUST YOU KNOW 
IT MAKES THEM FEEL A BIT MORE AT EASE WITH YOU 
I'VE HAD PEOPLE AT PARTIES I'VE COME OUT OF A PARTY AND YOU'RE GETTING CHANGED 
AND THEY'RE JUST SAYING YOU DIRTY OLD CLOWN PAEDO 
YOU KNOW 
HAD A GOOD TIME FEELING THE KIDS 
TO BE QUITE FRANK IF I WASN'T A CLOWN IT'S PROBABLY THE KIND OF THING I'D SAY 
IT'S UM IT'S WHAT PEOPLE SAY REALLY 
I JUST FEEL AS IF I WANT TO KICK THEIR FUCKING TEETH IN 
I'D LOVE TO KICK THEIR FUCKING TEETH IN 
I MARCH IN GET MYSELF SORTED OUT THERE IS NO CHANCE 
NOT EVEN THE MEREST HINT OF GETTING A CHILD ON THEIR OWN 
IT'S NOT AS IF YOU GET A CHILD UP ON STAGE AND SAY 
I'M GOING TO PULL THIS COVER OVER THEM AND MAKE THINGS DISAPPEAR FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES 
IT JUST WOULDN'T HAPPEN 
IF YOU'RE GOING SHOPPING IF YOU GO ALONE YOU CAN SEE THE CHILDREN 
YOU LOOK AT THEM AND GIVE THEM A SMILE 
NOW PARENTS CAN TAKE THAT IF THEY DON'T KNOW YOU THEY'RE GOING TO THINK 
WHAT'S HE LOOKING AT MY CHILD FOR WHY IS HE SMILING AT THE CHILD 
SOME PEOPLE WOULD TAKE THAT THE WRONG WAY 
SO YOU REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN IN HERE BEFORE NO NO NEVER 
NOT EVEN IN THE OLD DAYS NO 
BUT THE GREAT NEWS IS I'VE GOT MY NEW ROUTINE GOING AT LAST 
WELL IT'S NOT NEW IT'S TWO YEARS OLD NOW I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR TWO YEARS 
WELL I SUPPOSE IT'S BECAUSE I TAKE WHAT I DO QUITE SERIOUSLY 
ANY KIND OF ARTISTIC THING YOU'VE GOT TO FOCUS A BIT 
THE TROUBLE IS YOU END UP WITH TUNNEL VISION AND THAT'S ALL YOU DO 
THE ONSLAUGHT STARTS TOMORROW 
SO I DON'T WANT TO STAY OUT TOO LATE EITHER REALLY 
YOU CAN'T DO A KID'S PARTY WITH A HANGOVER 
THE KIDS WILL KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG THEY'LL PICK UP ON IT 
AND THEY'LL GET AT EVERY LITTLE NICK IN YOUR ARMOUR EVERY CHINK 
IN YOUR ARMOUR AND THEY'LL GET YOU AND GET YOU AND THEY'LL PULL YOU DOWN AND IT'LL BE AWFUL 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF DOUG'S JOB THEN ERICA 
WELL I THINK IT'S VERY FUNNY 
IN A SORT OF A QUITE HEART WARMING WAY HE'S A VERY WARM PERSON 
SO IT'S GOOD 
BUT I JUST SOMETIMES FEEL THAT HE CAN'T REALLY DIVORCE HIMSELF FROM THE ROLE 
YOU KNOW 
AND HE COMES OUT WITH SORT OF MAKING PIRATE NOISES 
IN SOMETIMES VERY INAPPROPRIATE PLACES WHAT NOISES 
THOSE SORT OF QUITE THROATY NOISES 
AARRHH THAT'D BE BECAUSE I BE A PIRATE SEE WELL 
POTTY THE PIRATE IS A DISTILLATION OF VARIOUS PARTS OF MY OWN CHARACTER 
SO REALLY POTTY THE PIRATE IS ALREADY ME 
SO I'M NEVER GOING TO BE ANY DIFFERENT TO POTTY THE PIRATE 
IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S POSSIBLY A LITTLE BIT MORE TO DISCOVER IN THE REAL PERSON 
YOU KNOW I HAVE TO ACCEPT HIM AS HE IS 
JUST GO WITH IT I THINK 
THIS ONE IS OF ME MY MUM MY DAD 
AND FIONA ON OUR WEDDING DAY 
LET'S SEE IF I'VE GOT ANY MORE HERE 
OH THIS IS A GOOD ONE YOU'LL LIKE THIS 
THAT'S ME AS JULIAN CLARY WHEN I WAS IN MY BAND 
WOW YEAH VERY CAMP 
CHOKE COLLAR FOR THAT EXTRA GAY LOOK 
AND THE CYCLING PANTS LOOK DID MEN COME ON TO YOU PARDON 
DID MEN COME ON TO YOU WHILE YOU WERE DRESSED LIKE THAT 
MIGHT HAVE DONE 
WHEN I WAS IN THE BAND MUM USED TO COME AND WATCH AND SHE'D PUT ALL MY MAKE UP ON 
IF IT WASN'T ON PROPERLY SHE'D TELL ME 
OR THAT WASN'T SUCH A GOOD GIG THIS WAS A GOOD GIG 
OR YOUR CHOKE COLLAR'S NOT ON PROPERLY 
I USED TO DO A BIT OF ELTON JOHN A BIT OF PHIL COLLINS A BIT OF QUEEN 
AND SHE LIKED TO SING AS WELL SHE'D WHISTLE 
MUM LIKED NAT KING COLE THERE WE ARE 
UNFORGETTABLE 
IT'S NOT A BRILLIANT VIDEO BUT IT'S MEMORIES ISN'T IT 
I WANT TO SORT OF KEEP IT 
UNFORGETTABLE 
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE 
THAT'S A LOVELY PICTURE OF MUM ISN'T IT 
UNFORGETTABLE 
THOUGH NEAR OR FAR 
LIKE A SONG OF LOVE THAT CLINGS TO ME 
HOW THE THOUGHT OF YOU DOES THINGS TO ME 
NEVER BEFORE 
HAS SOMEONE BEEN MORE 
WITH ALZHEIMER'S YEAH 
YOU ARE YOU GO BACK TO BEING LIKE A CHILD REALLY 
SHE HAD SOME TESTS DONE AND EVERYTHING 
I THINK THINGS JUST DETERIORATED OVER THE LAST 
I'D SAY THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF 
IT WAS VERY QUICK THEN YEAH IT HAPPENED IN ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF 
VERY VERY QUICKLY 
THAT'S WHY DARLING 
IT'S INCREDIBLE 
THAT SOMEONE SO UNFORGETTABLE 
THINKS THAT I AM UNFORGETTABLE TOO 
WHAT DO YOU MISS 
UM 
UM 
I JUST MISS BEING ABLE TO GO UP AND TALK TO HER 
YOU KNOW AND HAVE CUDDLES AND THINGS 
IF I HAD ANY PROBLEMS I COULD GO AND TALK TO MUM 
I SOMETIMES FIND IT A BIT DIFFICULT TO GO AND TALK TO DAD WHEREAS MUM 
I COULD JUST TALK TO AND SHE WOULD SAY JUST COME AND HAVE A CUDDLE WHICH WAS NICE 
I HAVEN'T REALLY GOT THAT ANY MORE 
I CAN GIVE THE CUDDLES YOU KNOW BUT YOU DON'T GET THE SAME RESPONSE AS YOU WOULD WHEN 
SHE WAS WELL WHICH I MISS WHICH I WOULD LIKE BACK AGAIN 
AND IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IS IT 
I TRY AND ALWAYS BE THAT SORT OF HAPPY PERSON 
BUT YOU PUT THAT ON FOR YOUR MUM AS WELL DON'T YOU YEAH 
HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN YOUR MUM'S ENTERTAINER 
YEAH YEAH 
HELLO ROBBIE 
I'M ALL RIGHT IT'S ROBBIE THE MAGICIAN 
ARE YOU 
SWING LOW 
SWEET CHARIOT 
COMING FOR TO CARRY ME HOME 
SWING LOW 
SWEET CHARIOT 
COMING FOR TO CARRY ME E. E. 
HO O. O. M. E. 
TELL ME ABOUT ERICA SHE SEEMED SO LOVELY 
WHAT DOES SHE MEAN TO YOU 
AH WELL I DON'T KNOW REALLY IT'S A STRANGE RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE BECAUSE 
ONE OF THE VERY FIRST THINGS SHE SAID TO ME WAS WELL WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN COMMON 
I DON'T THINK SHE TAKES THE RELATIONSHIP SERIOUSLY AT ALL SO I'M NOT ABOUT TO EITHER 
YOU SEE I AM 
THE FUNDAMENTAL THING ABOUT ME IS I BELIEVE IN GOD PRETTY FERVENTLY 
I DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO RELIGION 
BUT I KNOW THAT GOD'S REAL BECAUSE GOD'S DEMONSTRATED 
TO ME IN MY LIFE THAT HE EXISTS 
CALL IT UNIVERSAL INTELLIGENCE GREATER POWER WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT BUT IT IS REAL 
THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL THING IN MY LIFE 
SO THE THING ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS IS IT COMES SECONDARY TO THAT 
DO YOU RELATE YOUR JOB TO YOUR BELIEFS 
PUT IT LIKE THIS MY WHOLE LIFE IS A PRODUCT OF MY FAITH YEAH 
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO ME IN LIFE 
I BELIEVE IS A PRODUCT OF WHAT I BELIEVE 
SO YES IT'S RELATED 
IT'S NOT DIRECTLY RELATED 
AND I WOULD NEVER START TALKING TO CHILDREN ABOUT GOD IN SUCH TERMS 
I PREFER FOR CHILDREN TO TALK ABOUT MAGIC 
BECAUSE AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED GOD AND MAGIC ARE PRETTY MUCH EQUIVALENT 
MAGIC WAND AND A RED BALL AND A HAT 
THAT'S A HAT TRICK ONLY DID IT ONCE 
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD 
WHAT YOU DO IS YOU TAKE THE BALL OFF THE WAND 
THROW IT IN THE AIR WHERE IT'S INVISIBLE WAIT FOR IT TO COME DOWN 
OVER THE TOP AND THERE IT IS 
I HAD TO CHANGE MY LIFE A BIT UM 
SO WHAT DO YOU DO NOW 
WHAT HAVE YOU HAD TO DO 
I JUST THOUGHT OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT LIKE MAGIC OTHER THAN KIDS 
IT ISN'T TEENAGERS IT ISN'T THE STAND UP COMEDY CROWD 
IT'S PEOPLE OF AN OLDER MORE CIVILISED GENERATION 
WHAT ARE THEY LIKE AS AN AUDIENCE THEN QUIET 
NO THEY'RE FINE BUT THEY WATCH 
THEY'RE NOT STUPID YOU KNOW THEY WATCH 
AND IT'S A MAGICIAN A MAGICIAN 
THEY'VE BEEN BROUGHT UP ON FORTIES AND FIFTIES AND SIXTIES SORT OF VARIETY SHOWS 
YEAH 
THEY'RE NOT XBOX 
THEY ARE STILL DOING JIGSAW PUZZLES 
THIS HASN'T BEEN HEARD FOR YEARS

I WAS SEEING NATHAN BECAUSE NATHAN WAS REALLY UPSET 
ABOUT WHAT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH RICKY THERE WAS A LOAD OF PEOPLE TRYING TO JUMP HIM 
WELL STICK AWAY FROM ALL OF THEM THEY'RE ALL BAD NEWS 
AND YOUR BEHAVIOUR IS CRIMINAL

I WAS HAVING THIS ARGUMENT WITH THIS TEACHER BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T LET ME MOVE A CHAIR 
AND HE WAS EXCLUDING ME FROM THE REST OF THE GIRLS IN MY CLASS 
THEN HE WENT TO PICK ON ME ON MY OWN AND I GOT IN A MOOD ABOUT IT AND THEN 
HE'S REALLY SMALL SO I CALLED HIM A FLID WHICH I KNOW THAT WAS QUITE OUT OF ORDER 
BUT HE DOES LOOK LIKE ONE AND THEN 
I JUST GOT REALLY ANGRY AND I SWORE A LOT AND I PUNCHED A LOT 
AND WENT COMPLETELY OFF THE HANDLE 
AND THEN I GOT IN A BIT OF A FIGHT WITH THE POLICEMAN

I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS 
SOMETIMES I JUST KICK OFF 
IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS 
I COULDN'T REALLY GIVE A FLYING FUCK AT A ROLLING DOUGHNUT 
IT'S NOT THE WORSE THING EVER TO HAPPEN IN THE WORLD 
IT'S JUST A BIT OF A PAIN COS IT JUST MEANS THAT AS A MARKER OF LONG LIFE SO FAR 
IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL AS IF I HAVEN'T DONE AS GOOD A JOB AS I SHOULD HAVE DONE 
AND I THINK THIS HAS BEEN A SHOCK FOR YOU AS WELL

I THINK IT WOULD BE QUITE A GOOD JOB THE THING IS SHE'S GOT A. 
TO BE A GOOD CLOWN OR A CHILDREN'S ENTERTAINER YOU'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH 
A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF PERSONAL UPHEAVAL SO TO BE IN A ROOM OF SCREAMING KIDS ALL THEY WANT TO DO 
IS PUNCH YOU IN THE BUTT IT SEEMS LIKE AN ALL RIGHT NIGHT 
YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO IT COS YOU'VE HELPED ME OUT IN THE PAST
