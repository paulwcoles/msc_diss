WELCOME TO WEATHERVIEW DESPITE CLEAR SKIES OVERNIGHT 
TEMPERATURES WON'T FALL VERY LOW 
BUT THEY HAVE A LONG WAY TO FALL 
HERE'S SOME OF THE HIGH TEMPERATURES 
HAILSHAM IN SUSSEX 
ALONG WITH LONDON AND KING'S LYNN 
HITTING TWENTY SEVEN CELSIUS 
JUST OVER EIGHTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT 
CLEARER SKIES ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES 
SOME CLOUD STILL AROUND AND THE ODD SHOWER 
LINGERING ACROSS SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND DRY 
BUT HERE TOO THERE'LL BE CLOUDY SPELLS 
MIST AROUND THE IRISH SEA DOWN TO TEN TO FOURTEEN DEGREES 
A BRIGHT START TO THE DAY ACROSS WALES 
JUST THAT MIST LAPPING ONTO SOME OF THE COAST 
BUT FINE AND BRIGHT ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND 
THE PROSPECT OF MORE IN THE WAY OF SUNSHINE 
AS THE DAY GOES ON 
STILL THOSE SHOWERS AROUND ACROSS PARTS OF SCOTLAND 
CLOUDIER SKIES GENERALLY HERE 
BUT ONCE WE GET TO NORTHERN ENGLAND 
AND INTO THE MIDLANDS MUCH BRIGHTER BLUE SKIES FOR SUNDAY 
A LOT OF HIGH CLOUD ON SATURDAY 
THAT MADE THE SUNSHINE MILKY AT BEST 
BUT THAT'S MOVING OUT OF THE WAY 
SO CLEAR BLUE SKIES FOR MANY TO START THE DAY 
ACROSS THE MIDLANDS AND SOUTHERN ENGLAND 
AGAIN A BIT OF MIST LINGERING OVER THE SEA 
WHICH MIGHT THREATEN NORTH CORNWALL AND DEVON COASTS 
THROUGH THE DAY BUT ONLY IF SEA BREEZES DEVELOP 
AND PULL IT ON SHORE IN THE AFTERNOON 
THE SUNSHINE WILL BECOME MORE EXTENSIVE 
EXTENDING INTO NORTHERN IRELAND AND SCOTLAND 
THE ODD SHOWER THROUGH THE AFTERNOON 
BUT THEY WILL BE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN 
TEMPERATURES TWENTY SIX IN BIRMINGHAM 
TWENTY FIVE IN MANCHESTER 
A BIT COOLER NEAR SOME OF THOSE NORTH SEA COASTS 
BECAUSE OF THE INCREASING THREAT OF THE SEA MIST COMING ON SHORE 
MURRAY FIRTH FOR EXAMPLE 
BUT PLENTY OF SUNSHINE ELSEWHERE ACROSS SCOTLAND 
THE ODD SHOWER FOR NORTHERN IRELAND THROUGH THE AFTERNOON 
ONE OR TWO OVER THE HIGHER GROUND OF WALES 
WITH MAYBE SOME MIST AROUND THE COAST 
BUT ESSENTIALLY A FINE AND WARM DAY AGAIN 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST ENGLAND 
BRIGHT BLUE SKIES A NICE DAY FOR THE BEACH 
SOUTHEAST WALES AND THE WEST COUNTRY 
SEEING THE HIGHEST TEMPERATURES OF THE DAY 
POSSIBLY TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT IN PLACES 
BIT MORE OF A BREEZE ACROSS SOUTHERN ENGLAND GENERALLY 
THAT WILL BE NOTICEABLE 
BUT IT'LL STOP IT FEELING TOO HOT 
ANY SHOWERS THAT DEVELOP WILL TAKE TIME TO DIE AWAY 
THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT AND INTO EARLY MONDAY 
FAIRLY CLEAR SKIES 
PARTICULARLY ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES 
BUT SIMILAR TEMPERATURES BETWEEN TEN AND THIRTEEN DEGREES 
EIGHT OR NINE DEGREES THE LOW ACROSS NORTHEASTERN PARTS OF THE U. K. 
THOSE TEMPERATURES MIGHT NOT PICK UP MUCH 
ACROSS THE EASTERN SIDE OF SCOTLAND AND NORTHEAST ENGLAND 
DURING MONDAY BECAUSE OF THIS BRISK WIND OFF THE NORTH SEA 
SEA TEMPERATURES ONLY NINE OR TEN DEGREES AT THE MOMENT 
THAT INCREASES THE THREAT OF THAT LOW CLOUD 
ACROSS NORTHEAST ENGLAND AND EASTERN SCOTLAND 
BUT ELSEWHERE A DRY AND BRIGHT DAY 
CERTAINLY A SUNNY DAY FOR MOST 
TEMPERATURES AGAIN GETTING INTO THE LOW TO MID TWENTIES 
SIMILAR TEMPERATURES THROUGH TO THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK 
WITH INCREASING RISK OF SEEING THAT LOW CLOUD 
FEEDING INTO EASTERN SCOTLAND 
THAT COULD KEEP TEMPERATURES LOW IN EDINBURGH
