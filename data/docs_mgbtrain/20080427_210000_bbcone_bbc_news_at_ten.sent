PARADE SPRAYING HAMID KARZAI AND 
FOREIGN DIGNITARIES WITH BULLETS 
TWO AFGHAN MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT 
ARE KILLED THE BRITISH AMBASSADORS 
ESCAPE UNHURT WE'LL BE REPORTING 
ON THE GROWING FRAGILITY OF THE 
AFGHANISTAN GOVERNMENT A MEDICAL 
BREAKTHROUGH AH BRITISH SCIENTIST 
WHO HAS CAUSED SIGHT FOR FOR 
PATIENTS CLOSE BLINDNESS BLINDNESS EMERGENCY SUPPLIES OF OIL ARE 
SHIPPED IN FROM EUROPE 
THE AUSTRIAN WOMAN HELD CAPTIVE FOR 
TWENTY FOUR YEARS IN A CELLAR HER FATHER'S 
ACCUSED OF FORCING HER TO BEAR 
SEVEN OF HIS CHILDREN 
AND CELTIC'S OLD FIRM WIN KEEPS THE 
TITLE RACE ALIVE IN SCOTLAND 
GOOD EVENING TALEBAN GUNMEN CAME 
CLOSE TO ASASNATING AFGHANISTAN'S 
PRESIDENT TODAY WITH AN ATTACK ON A 
MILITARY PARADE IN THE CENTRE OF 
KABUL HAMID KARZAI WAS CELEBRATING 
HIS COUNTRY'S NATIONAL DAY WITH 
HUNDREDS OF DIGNITARIES PRESENT 
WHEN THE ATTACKERS OPENED FIRE 
THREE PEOPLE WERE SHOT DEAD JUST 
YARDS AWAY FROM HIM THE TALEBAN 
SAID IT WAS PROOF THEY COULD STRIKE 
WHEREVER THEY WANTED TO 
A PRESIDENTIAL MILITARY PARADE 
REMEMBERING AN HISTORICAL AFGHAN 
VICTORY AND CELEBRATING THE 
STRENGTH OF THE NEW ARMY IN THE 
STADIUM A WHO'S WHO OF AFGHAN 
LEADERS PAST AND PRESENT FOREIGN 
AMBASSADORS COMMANDERS AND 
DIGNITARIES DIGNITARIES AS THEY STOOD FOR THE NATIONAL 
ANTHEM AND A TWENTY ONE GUN SALUTE THE 
ATAX STRUCK 
ATTACKERS STRUCK GUNFIRE 
BY THE TIME THE CAMERAS TURNED TO 
PRESIDENT KARZAI'S SEAT HE'D 
ALREADY BEEN BUNDLED AWAY TO SAFETY 
BY HIS BODYGUARDS THE BRITISH 
AMBASSADOR WAS ALSO IN THE FRONT 
ROW HE DESCRIBED WHAT HAPPENED I I SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE A PUFF OF 
SMOKE AT THE SOUTHERN LEFT HAPPENED 
END OF THE PARADE GROUND IN SOME 
DERELICT BUILDINGS THERE AND 
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE CRACK OF 
SMALL ARMS FIRE GRADUALLY RISING 
AND I SAW THE PRESIDENT'S 
PROTECTIVE SECURITY DETAIL START TO 
DIRECT THEIR GUNS SOUTHWARDS AND 
OPEN FIRE 
AFGHAN NATIONAL TELEVISION CAPTURED 
LIVE THE MOMENT TWO MEMBERS OF 
PARLIAMENT WERE HIT AND OTHER V. I. P.'S 
DIVED FOR COVER PRESIDENT KARZAI 
HAD A LUCKY ESCAPE 
MORTAR BOMBS AND ROCKETS ALSO 
LANDED NEAR THE PARADE GROUND 
EXPLOSION EXPLOSION THERE WAS PANIC WITHOUT AMMUNITION 
THE SOLDIERS UNCEREMONIOUSLY RAN 
FOR COVER 
WHAT BETTER IMAGE COULD THERE BE 
FOR TALEBAN PROPAGANDA THAN THIS 
WITHIN TWO HOURS THE MAN BRITAIN 
AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS 
INVESTING IN FOR THE COUNTRY'S 
FUTURE WAS BACK ON TELEVISION 
EVERYTHING IS BACK TO NORMAL HE 
TOLD THE NATION 
BUT THREE PEOPLE WERE KILLED 
INCLUDING THIS TRIBAL ELDER AND 
TEN YEAR OLD BOY CAUGHT IN THE 
CROSSFIRE GRIEF AND MOURNING ON 
DAY THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT 
CELEBRATION CELEBRATION THE FACT THAT THE TALEBAN WERE ABLE 
TO DIRECTLY TARGET THE PRESIDENT 
AND SENIOR AFGHAN AND FOREIGN 
OFFICIALS RIGHT HERE IN THE HEART 
OF THE CAPITAL CITY AND LIVE ON 
NATIONAL TELEVISION IS NOT NOT ONLY 
EMBARRASSING IT'S ALSO HUGELY 
WORRYING BOTH FOR THE AFGHAN 
GOVERNMENT AND FOR THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WHO CLAIM 
TO BE BEATING THE INSURGENCY 
FOR THE FIRST TIME BRITISH 
SCIENTISTS HAVE MANAGED TO REVERSE 
NEAR BANK OF ENGLANDNESS 
NEAR BLINDNESS THE SCIENTISTS USED 
A GENE THERAPY TO REGENERATE LIGHT 
DETECTING CELLS BEHIND THE RETINA 
SIX MONTHS AGO STEPHEN COULD 
HARDLY SEE AT NIGHT 
EVENTUALLY HE WOULD HAVE BECOME 
COMPLETELY BLIND NOW THANKS TO AL 
REMARKABLE OPERATION HIS SIGHT HAS 
ACTUALLY BEGUN TO IMPROVE ON A 
DARK NIGHT TELL ME HOW YOUR VISION 
HAS CHANGED 
BEFORE ALL I WOULD 
SEE WAS LIKE STREETLIGHTS JUST 
WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THEM NOW I CAN 
SEE LIKE FURTHER ON FROM THE 
STREETLIGHTS 
AT NIGHT THIS IS HOW STREETLIGHTS THE WORLD LOOKED TO STEPHEN BEFORE 
HIS OPERATION BUT NOW IT'S MORE 
LIKE THIS HE CAN SEE ENOUGH TO 
WALK HOME SAFELY IN THE DARK 
AND HE'S NOW CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO 
TAKE THE SHORT CUTS THROUGH THE 
BACK STREETS 
THE OPERATION HAS GIVEN HIM A NEW 
LEASE OF LIFE 
WHAT I WANT TO DO I 
THINK I'M AIMING FOR IS TO GET A 
JOB IN A MUSIC STUDIO PRACTICE 
ROOM SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN 
EVENTUALLY MOVE OUT AND GET MY OWN 
PLACE 
IT MUST HAVE GIVEN YOU A PLACE REAL BOOST IN YOUR CONFIDENCE IT'S IT'S GOOD BECAUSE I USED TO BE DEAD SHY 
LIKE SILENT AND NOW THAT I'VE GOT 
THE CONFIDENCE TO WALK AROUND ON MY 
OWN 
B. B. C. NEWS HAS SPENT THE YEAR OWN FOLLOWING THE PIONEERING RESEARCH 
THAT'S HELPED STEPHEN 
HIS EYESIGHT WAS FAILING BECAUSE OF 
A FAULTY GENE SURGEONS AT 
MOORFIELDS HOSPITAL INJECTED GOOD 
COPIES OF THE GENE INTO THE BACK OF 
STEPHEN'S EYE UNDERNEATH THE 
RETINA WHICH CONTAINS THE CELLS 
THAT NORMALLY DETECT LIGHT IN 
STEPHEN'S CASE THESE CELLS DIDN'T 
WORK THE REPLACEMENT GENES SEEMS 
TO HAVE HEALED THE DYING CELLS AND 
IMPROVED STEPHEN'S SIGHT TESTS IN 
THIS DIMLY LIT MAZE SHOW AN AMAZING 
IMPROVEMENT JUST AFTER THE 
OPERATION STEPHEN KEEPS BUMPING 
INTO THE WALLS IT TAKES HIM ONE 
MINUTE AND SEVENTEEN SECONDS TO GET TO THE 
END END BUT SIX MONTHS LATER HE GOES 
STRAIGHT THROUGH 
I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO REMEMBER 
BEING AS EXCITED AS I AM TODAY 
ABOUT OUR SCIENCE AND WHAT WE MIGHT 
BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE WITH THAT 
SCIENCE SCIENCE STEPHEN SAYS THE SCIENCE HAS 
IMPROVED HIS PLAYING BECAUSE HE CAN 
SEE THE FRETS ON HIS GUITAR MORE 
CLEARLY THESE PROMISING RESULTS 
SUGGEST THAT GENE THERAPY COULD 
EVENTUALLY HELP MANY MORE 
BRITAIN'S FOURTH BIG FOUR BIGGEST 
SUPERMARKETS ARE FACING NEW 
INVESTIGATIONS INTO ALLEGATIONS OF 
PRICE FIXING THE INQUIRIES IS 
THOUGHT TO RELATE TO GROCERIES AS 
WELL AS HEALTH AND BEAUTY BEAUTY 
PRODUCTS THE SUPERMARKETS SAID 
THEY ARE CO OPERATEING WITH THE 
INVESTIGATION MORE FUEL SUPPLIES 
ARE ARRIVING AT SCOTTISH PORTS 
TONIGHT IN AN EFFORT TO SOFTEN THE 
IMPACT OF A TWO DAY STRIKE AT THE 
GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY STAFF WALKED 
OUT OF THE PLANT EARLIER THIS 
MORNING IN A DISPUTE OVER THEIR 
PENSIONS GRANGEMOUTH IS SCOTLAND'S 
ONLY OIL REFINERY AND THE FIRST 
BRITISH REFINERY TO BE SHUT DOWN BY 
A STRIKE IN SEVENTY YEARS 
IN AN ORDERLY AND SILENT PROCESSION 
THE NIGHTSHIFT WORKERS FILED OUT OF 
THE GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY AT DAWN 
MARKING THE FIRST SHUTDOWN MUCH 
THIS PLANT FOR MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS 
THEY'RE DETERMINED TO FIGHT WHAT 
THEY SEE AS AN UNWARRANTED ATTACK 
ON THEIR PENSIONS 
THIS IS 
SOMETHING WE REALLY BELIEVE IN AND 
WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT FOR OUR 
PENSIONS TO THE END 
WE DON'T WANT 
TO BE OUT ON STRIKE NOBODY REALLY 
WANTS TO BE OUT ON STRIKE BUT 
THEY'VE NOT GIVEN US ANY CHOICE 
WITH PICKETS OUT IN FORCE THE 
REFINERY'S OWNERS SAID THEY NEED TO 
ALTER PENSION ARRANGEMENTS FOR NEW 
WORKERS AS PART OF THEIR PLANS TO 
SAFEGUARD THE PLANT'S FUTURE WE WE ARE LOOKING AT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION WORTH 
OF INVESTMENT AND THE UNION ARE 
PUTTING THAT INVESTMENT AT RISK 
THROUGH THEIR ACTION AND ON THE 
BACK OF THAT INVESTMENT HANG SIX HUNDRED FIFTY 
JOBS 
BUT THE SHUTDOWN AT JOBS GRANGEMOUTH HAS ALSO LED TO THE 
CLOSURE OF THE PIPELINE BRINGING 
NEARLY HALF OF BRITAIN'S NORTH SEA 
OIL ASHORE EVEN SO THE 
AUTHORITIES SAY THEY'VE PREPARED 
CAREFULLY FOR THE STRIKE THERE ARE 
NINE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX FORECOURTS IN SCOTLAND 
THEY'RE SUPPLIED BY LOWERS FROM 
THREE MAIN DEPOSE INCLUDING 
GRANGEMOUTH GRANGEMOUTH FORECOURTS RUNNING SHORT OF FUEL 
ARE BEING QUICKLY RESTOCKED TO 
PREVENT PANIC BUYING AND EXTRA 
SUPPLIES ARE BEING SHIPPED IN FROM 
ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE 
THERE'S A 
WHOLE FLEET OF TANKERS COMING FROM 
CONTINENTAL EUROPE FROM AMSTERDAM 
FROM GOTHENBURG AND A VARIETY OF 
PLACES PARTICULARLY WITH DIESEL 
TO ALLEVIATE ANY POSSIBLE SHORTAGES 
WHEN GRANGEMOUTH IS DOWN 
BUT UNLOADING THE PETROL AND DIESEL 
FROM THOSE VESSELS AT THE 
REFINERY'S DOCKS WILL REQUIRE THE 
AGREEMENT AND CO OPERATION OF THE 
UNIONS UNIONS ONCE THIS STRIKE DOES COME TO AN 
END BOTH SIDES ARE LIKELY TO COME 
UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE TO GET 
BACK TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE TO 
TRY TO FIND A WAY OF SETTLING THIS 
BITTER DISPUTE TONIGHT AS THE 
GRANGEMOUTH WORKERS PREPARE FOR 
ANOTHER DAY ON THE PICKET LINES 
THAT SEEMS DISTANT PROSPECT 
A SEVENTY THREE YEAR OLD MAN HAS BEEN ARRESTED 
IN AUSTRIA ON SUSPICION OF INCREST 
AND OF KEEPING HIS DAUGHTER LOCKED 
IN A CELLAR FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS 
POLICE BELIEVE THAT HE AFFECTED 
TOTAL OF SEVEN CHILDREN WITH THE 
WOMAN WHO IS NOW FORTY TWO YEARS OLD 
OUR CORRESPONDENT IS INAM SETEN 
THE PEOPLE HERE ARE IN A STATE OF 
SHOCK THEIR QUIET DOWN NEAR THE 
DANUBE RIVER IS NOW THE SCENE OF 
CRIME OF THE MOST SINISTER CRIME 
INVESTIGATIONS IN RECENT AUSTRIAN 
HISTORY THIS IS THE HOUSE WHERE 
POLICE SAY A TERRIBLE SECRET WAS 
KEPT FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS 
THEY SAY WOMAN CALLED LIST WAS 
HELD CAPTIVE IN THE CELLAR BY HER 
FATHER JOSEF HE HAS NOW BEEN 
ARRESTED SUSPECTED OF FATHERING 
SEVEN CHILDREN WITH HER 
ONE CHILD IS BELIEVED TO HAVE DIED 
WHEN IT WAS JUST A BABY POLICE SAY 
THREE OF THE CHILDREN LIVED 
UPSTAIRS WITH JOSEF AND HIS WIFE 
THE OTHERS WERE KEPT LOCKED UP IN 
THE BASEMENT NOW THEY'VE BEEN SET 
FREE FREE THEY'RE BEING CARED 
FOR INDIVIDUALLY THOSE BETWEEN TWELVE 
AND SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE WHO GREW UP 
WITH THEIR GRANDPARENTS AND TWO 
BOYS WHO WHEN THEY CAME OUT 
YESTERDAY WHEN THEIR MOTHER SAW 
THE DAY LIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
THEIR LIVES 
THE POLICE HAVE BEEN SEARCHING THE 
HOUSE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM THIS IS 
CASE THAT HAS SHOCKED THIS SMALL 
TOWN AND THE NATION 
THE CASE CAME TO LIGHT WHEN ONE OF 
THE CHILDREN A NINETEEN YEAR OLD GIRL 
CALLEDERS TEN WAS BROUGHT 
KIRSTEN TO HOSPITAL A WEEK AGO SHE 
IS STILL IN A SERIOUS CONDITION 
POLICE SAY THEY'LL RRY OUT D. N. A. 
TESTS TO SEE IF JESEF IS THE FATHER 
OF THE CHILDREN MANY AUSTRIANS ARE 
WONDERING TONIGHT HOW SUCH CRIMES 
COULD HAVE GONE UNNOTICED 
TIME NOW TO CATCH UP ON WHAT'S BEEN 
HAPPENING ON THE FOOTBALL FRONT 
HELLO THERE WE'LL START WITH 
FOOTBALL BECAUSE RANGERS HAVE 
TRIPPED UP AGAIN IN THEIR QUEST FOR 
A CLEAN SWEEP OF TROPHIES IN 
SCOTLAND THEY LOST THREE TO TWO TO CELTIC 
TO FALL FIVE POINTS BEHIND THEIR 
GREAT RIVALS IN THE LEAGUE 
ALTHOUGH THEY DO HAVE THREE GAMES 
IN HAND'LL STILL FIGHTING FOR THAT 
QUADRUPLE OF TROPHIES CELTIC KNEW 
THEIR WIN AT CELTIC PARK WOULD 
CLINCH THE TITLE WHEN JAN 
VENNEGOOR OF HESSELINK NODDED DOWN 
TO SCOTT MCDONALD WHO MAY HAVE BEEN 
OFFSIDE CELTIC WERE IN FRONT 
RANGERS HAVE SO MANY GAMES IN HAND 
THAT MATHEMATICALLY THEY COULD 
AFFORD TO LOSE AND STILL WIN THE 
LEAGUE THAT KIND OF THINKING 
DOESN'T APPLY TO OLD FIRM MATCHES 
DAVID WEIR FOUND A WAY THROUGH AND 
CELTIC WILL BE KIKT THEMSELVES THEY 
LEFT THE SAME DOOR OPEN FOR DANIEL 
KOOZANN KOOZANN BUT BY HALF TIME THEY WERE LEVEL 
MCDONALD AGAIN THERE'S TO BE NO 
HAT TRICK FOR HIM BUT THEY BIG 
SAY IN THE WINNER BARRY ROBSON 
TOOK THE HONOURS 
IF RANGERS DO STUMBLE IN THE LEAGUE 
LEG OF THIS THIS QUADRUPLE IT MAY 
BE BECAUSE OF LACK OF PERSONNEL 
AS WELL AS POINTS STEPHEN 
WHITAKER'S LATE SENDING OFF MEANS 
HE'LL MISS KEY RANGERS MATCHES IN 
THEIR RUN IN ALL IN ALL THE 
PERFECT RESULT FOR CELTIC THERE 
WERE TWO GAMES IN THE PREMIER 
LEAGUE TODAY HIGHLIGHTS ARE ON 
MATCH OF THE DAY TWO RIGHT NOW ON B. B. C. 
TWO BUT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE 
RESULTS HERE THEY ARE 
EVERTON ARE STILL FIFTH AFTER 
DRAWING TWO TO TWO WITH ASTON VILLA 
Y. OBO PUT THEM TWO TO ONE UP ONLY FOR 
CAROU TO EQUALISE IN THE OTHER 
MATCH PORTSMOUTH LOST ONE TO ZERO TO 
BLACKBURN ROVERS LEWIS HAMILTON 
WAS ON THE BACK PODIUM TODAY HE 
CAME THIRD IN THE SPANISH GRAND 
PRIX AS FERRARI FINISHED THEIR 
DOMINANCE DOMINANCE THE BARCELONA TRACK HAS A 
REPUTATION FOR PRODUCING 
PROCESSIONAL RACES AND THAT WAS 
AGAIN PRETTY MUCH THE CASE AFTER 
THE START HAD SORTED OUT ITS 
WINNERS AND LOSERS THE FERRARIS 
EMERGED IN FIRST AND SECOND WHILE 
HAMILTON STOLE UP FROM FIFTH TO 
FOURTH WITH SMART MANOEUVRE BUT 
FOR HIS TEAM MATES FOR COULD HAVE 
COULD HAVE COULD HAVE THE RACE WAS 
TO PROVE ANYTHING BUT BUT 
STRAIGHTFORWARD HE WAS SENT 
HURTLING INTO THE TYRE WALL AT ONE HUNDRED FORTY 
MILES AN HOUR SO KEEP WAS HIS CAR 
BURIED THERE WERE IMMEDIATE 
CONCERNS FOR HIS SAFETY 
BUT WHEN HE EMERGED FROM 
STRETCHER IT WAS CLEAR HE HAD HAD 
A LUCKY ESCAPE SUFFERING LITTLE 
MORE THAN CONCUSSION 
HAMILTON DID HIS BEST TO CHASE DOWN 
THE FERRARIS WITHOUT THREATENING TO 
CATCH THEM THE REIGNING CHAMPION 
KIMI RAIKKONEN CAME HOME A WINNER 
TO EXTEND HIS CHAMPIONSHIP LEAD 
HAMILTON'S THIRD THIRD GOING TO 
SECOND PLACE AND NEEDS TO FIND MORE 
SPEED FROM HIS CAR MUNSTER ARE 
THROUGH TO RUGBY UNION'S HEINEKEN 
CUP FINAL AFTER BEATING SARACENS BY
