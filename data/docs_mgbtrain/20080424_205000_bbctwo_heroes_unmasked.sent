IT'S ACTION PACKED 
TWISTS TURNS 
THE ONLY THING I'M TRYING TO DO IS STAY ALIVE 
SEASON ONE ENDED ON A GREAT NOTE 
SEASON TWO IS GONNA DRAW YOU BACK 
THERE'S A LOT OF MYSTERIES THAT ARE STARTING TO UNRAVEL 
THE ANSWERS COME AS QUICKLY AS THE QUESTIONS 
GET OUT OF MY HEAD YOU CAN'T SIT BACK YOU CAN'T RELAX 
I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'LL DIE BUT I'M BACK FOR THAT FIRST EPISODE IT'S A WILD RIDE A LOT OF FUN 
I'M JUST GLAD TO BE BACK WORKING ON THIS AMAZING PROJECT BUCKLE UP 
B. CAMERA AMERICAN OPERATOR STANDING IN THE WAY 
AND ACTION MASI 
AT THE END OF SEASON ONE WE SAW HIRO TELEPORT BACK TO FEUDAL JAPAN 
AND WE BEGIN SEASON TWO WHERE WE LEFT OFF AT LEAST WHERE WE LEFT HIRO OFF 
YOU WANT ME TO ADJUST MY SIZE 
HE GETS TO KIND OF MEET HIS IDOL 
TAKEZO KENSEI FROM THE STORYBOOK LEGENDS 
THAT HIS FATHER TOLD HIM 
TELL TAKEZO KENSEI HE CAN KEEP HIS DAMN MONEY 
BUT KENSEI'S NOT QUITE 
WHO HE IMAGINED KENSEI WOULD BE 
AND A SPEED A CAMERA MARK 
B. CAMERA 
SET ON A SET ON B. HE'S RUNNING AWAY ACTION 
THIS IS WHERE HIRO MEETS HIS HERO 
KENSEI KENSEI TAKEZO 
HE FINDS OUT THAT I'M ACTUALLY AN ANGLO OR A GAJINI 
HE'S A WHITE GUY WITH A JAPANESE NAME 
AND HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE HIRO'S IDOL 
HUH 
HE'S A BIT OF A LOUT 
LIKES TO DRINK 
LIKES TO FIND HIMSELF A BAR 
YOU MUST BE SOBER HE'S LIKE A HOOKER WITH A HEART OF GOLD I SUPPOSE 
SO IT'S THE BEGINNING OF A BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL RELATIONSHIP 
WE HAD INTRODUCED THE CHARACTER OF KENSEI IN THE FIRST SEASON 
AS A STORYBOOK LEGEND THAT HIRO LIVED UP TO 
IT'S BECAUSE WE KNEW WHERE THAT CHARACTER WAS GOING 
AND WHAT WE WANTED HIM TO BE IN THE COMING VOLUMES 
IT DICTATED THAT HE WAS THAT HE WAS NOT JAPANESE 
YOU'RE ENGLISH 
HE WAS A COMPLETE HOAX AND A COMPLETE CHARLATAN 
WHAT THAT ENABLED US TO DO 
WAS TO GO LOOKING FOR AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ACTOR 
A WELL KNOWN FACE TO AMERICAN VIEWERS DAVID ANDERS IS PROBABLY BEST KNOWN 
FOR STARRING ALONGSIDE GREG GRUNBERG IN ALIAS 
BUT AS ALWAYS WITH HEROES NOTHING IS AS IT SEEMS 
HE FOOLED EVERYBODY INTO THINKING THAT HE ACTUALLY HAD A BRITISH ACCENT 
GIVEN THE FACT THAT HE IS FROM PORTLAND OREGON 
I FIRST CAME IN AN PLAYED IT LIKE 
PETER O'TOOLE AND I JUST DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING 
I LIKE YOU YOU KNOW 
I CAME OVER ON ONE OF THE FEW TRADE VESSELS YOUR EMPEROR LENT US 
THE BOAT LEFT FULL OF TEA I KEPT ON TO FIND MY FORTUNE 
AND NOW EVERYBODY'S GONNA THINK I'M ENGLISH THERE'S NO WAY THAT I'M NOT GONNA BE PEGGED AS AN ENGLISH ACTOR 
SO IF BEING ENGLISH CAME EASY HOW ABOUT LEARNING JAPANESE 
HE HAD THE CHALLENGE OF BEING ABLE TO LEARN JAPANESE AND BE ABLE TO SPEAK IT AS WELL AS HE COULD 
THIS IS LIKE CONVERSATIONAL JAPANESE SO 
I'M FLYING BLIND AND LEARNING IT PHONETICALLY AND JUST GETTING THE BEATS OF THE LANGUAGE DOWN 
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINES SOMETHING WILL CLICK AND I'LL REALISE WHAT I'M SAYING MAYBE 
HE DIDN'T SPEAK ANY JAPANESE AT ALL SO IT WAS HARD FOR HIM TO TRY AND LEARN THAT 
BUT HE DID AN AMAZING JOB LEARNING IT 
AND WHEN IT CAME TO THE CREATION OF FEUDAL JAPAN 
THE PRODUCTION TEAM HAD TO DO A FAIR AMOUNT OF LEARNING THEMSELVES 
A LOT OF STUDY WENT INTO HOW WE WERE GONNA DEPICT FEUDAL JAPAN 
A LOT OF KUROSAWA MOVIES WERE RUN I THINK WE UPPED THE AMOUNT OF SEVEN SAMURAI D. V. D. SETS 
WE MUST HAVE QUADRUPLED IT EVERY DEPARTMENT HAD ONE 
FOR US YOU KNOW DOING THE RESEARCH 
AND LEARNING ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE WORN 
AND THE HISTORY BEHIND EVERYTHING IS VERY EXCITING 
THE ARMOUR LOOKS AMAZING AND THEY TRY TO KEEP IT AS AUTHENTIC AS POSSIBLE 
THE COSTUME DEPARTMENT DID AN AMAZING JOB 
I THINK WHAT'S REALLY INCREDIBLE ABOUT ALL OF THIS IS YOU KNOW 
WE DON'T KNOW WHO THIS IS WHEN EVERYBODY LOOKS THE SAME 
SO THE REVEAL IS AMAZING BUT I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT A FEW THINGS 
FOR EXAMPLE ON THE HELMET HERE THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAD CREATED SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS 
THIS PIECE AND THESE PIECES HERE 
THESE PIECES HERE AND THEN OF COURSE YOU KNOW HE HAS HIS UNDERGARMENT 
HE HAS HIS SKIRT HE HAS HIS LEG PIECES 
WHICH ARE REALLY AMAZING THE SHIN GUARDS ARE BEAUTIFUL 
AND MAKING THE MASKS WAS YOU KNOW EXTRAORDINARY AND THEY'RE 
THEY'RE ALL LINED WITH LEATHER TO BE COMFORTABLE ON THE FACE 
WHICH I'M SURE THEY'RE STILL NOT THAT COMFORTABLE BUT AND THEN THE CHAIN MAIL 
WE ARE NOW REHEARSING 
O. K. REHEARSAL'S UP 
GOOD LORD 
NOBODY COMPLAINS TOO MUCH BUT I THINK IT'S PROBABLY 
A VERY VERY DIFFICULT THING AND BEING DRESSED IN IT EVERY DAY 
KENSEI TAKEZO 
THE COSTUME WAS REALLY A SPECIAL KIND OF TORTURE 
BUT IT WAS FUN GETTING INTO IT TAKING ABOUT AN HOUR 
IT WAS VERY HOT WE WERE FILMING IN AUGUST AND I'D BE LIKE 
IN THIS CAULDRON COSTUME 
AND I'D HAVE TO HAVE THOSE FIVE PEOPLE COME UNDRESS ME WHENEVER I NEEDED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM 
I LOST THE WEIGHT OF A SMALL CHILD WHEN WE SHOT THAT YEAH 
WITH OUR HEROES ABOUT TO EMBARK ON ANOTHER NERVE JANGLING JOURNEY TO SAVE THE WORLD 
THE ARRIVAL OF SOME NEW HEROES ARE SURE TO MAKE THE NEXT TEN WEEKS 
A HEART STOPPING AND PULSE RACING RIDE TO REMEMBER 
IT'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF FUN YOU KNOW HAVING NEW PEOPLE TO PLAY WITH 
COS IT GIVES A DIFFERENT ENERGY AND THAT MAKES IT ALWAYS FRESH 
CAN WE COUNT YOU IN 
THERE ARE HEROES ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT CAN POP UP 
AND YOU KNOW ARE GONNA HAVE DIFFERENT POWERS AND STORIES 
WE HAD ALWAYS SORT OF THOUGHT OF THE SHOW 
AS A SHOW THAT WOULD STOP OCCASIONALLY TO ALLOW NEW PASSENGERS TO JOIN 
I KNOW I'M SUPPOSED TO BE SOMEBODY THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE ME THAT WANTS TO COME OUT 
PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING IN TO SEE VOLUME TWO THEY CAN START RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING 
THAT STORY IS PAST AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS NOW IS NEW FOR ME AS IT IS FOR THE OTHER CHARACTERS 
WHY DRAW IT ACROSS NAKAMURA'S FACE 
COS WE DID SOMETHING TERRIBLE AND NOW SOMEONE WANTS REVENGE 
THE NEW AND OLD WILL COLLIDE AND WILL COLLABORATE AND MESH 
AND CREATE ONE BIG HARMONIOUS PUZZLE 
I THINK IT'S GREAT I THINK NEW CHARACTERS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR OUR SHOW 
GOTTA HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA DIE
