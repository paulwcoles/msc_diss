EVERYBODY HAS A PASSION FOR SOME IT'S FAST CARS 
FOR OTHERS FOOTBALL BUT FOR ME IT'S VOLCANOES 
I FIND SUCH POWERFUL AND DESTRUCTIVE FORCES OF NATURE IRRESISTIBLE 
I'M ON A CLIMB TO THE TOP OF MOUNT ETNA AND OFF ON A GRAND TOUR 
THAT WILL TAKE US TO TEN OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE VOLCANOES 
EVERY ONE WITH AN INTRIGUING STORY TO TELL 
AND WITH A FEW SURPRISES IN STORE 
SO IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH VOLCANO IS THREE TIMES TALLER THAN EVEREST 
WHERE THE CRATER IS THAT KILLED OVER A ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A RUMBLE 
AND WHO WAS THE POET THAT TOOK HIS INSPIRATION FROM A MASSIVE ERUPTION IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 
THEN STICK AROUND 
AS I REVEAL 
I'M STANDING ON THE SOUTHERN TIP OF ITALY ON THE ISLAND OF SICILY 
FAMOUS FOR GREAT WINES THE GODFATHER 
AND THIS MOUNTAIN BEHIND ME IT'S MOUNT ETNA 
IT'S GOT A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART BECAUSE IT'S THE FIRST VOLCANO I EVER VISITED 
MOUNT ETNA IS THE BIGGEST AND MOST ACTIVE VOLCANO IN EUROPE 
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT MAKES IT SO SPECIAL 
THIS IS WHERE VOLCANOLOGY BEGAN 
THE ANCIENT GREEKS WHO LIVED IN THE SHADOW OF MOUNT ETNA 
CREATED MYTHS AND LEGENDS TO EXPLAIN THE VOLCANO'S VIOLENT BEHAVIOUR 
SOME BELIEVED THAT ETNA ROARED AND SHOOK BECAUSE AFTER A FIERCE BATTLE 
ZEUS HAD MANAGED TO TRAP 
THE MANY HEADED MONSTER TYPHUS BENEATH IT 
OTHERS THOUGHT THESE VOLCANIC ROCKS ALONG THE COAST 
WERE THROWN HERE BY CYCLOPS FROM HIS FORGE UNDER THE MOUNTAIN 
BUT THEN A SICILIAN BORN GREEK PHILOSOPHER 
DEVELOPED A MORE RATIONAL APPROACH TO THE WORLD AROUND HIM 
IT WAS AROUND TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN A HERO OF MINE EMPEDOCLES 
CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF DIVIDING MATTER UP INTO FOUR MAIN ELEMENTS 
EARTH AIR FIRE AND WATER 
NOW THAT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A BIG STEP 
BUT TO ME EMPEDOCLES IS LIKE THE FATHER OF GEOLOGY 
RATHER THAN RELYING ON TALES OF BATTLES BETWEEN GODS AND MONSTERS 
HE ATTEMPTED TO PUT SOME KIND OF ORDER INTO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF NATURAL PHENOMENA LIKE VOLCANOES 
AND HE GOT HIS INSPIRATION RIGHT HERE ON ETNA 
OF COURSE WE NOW KNOW FAR MORE THAN THE ANCIENT GREEKS 
WE KNOW THAT VOLCANOES ARE ACTUALLY CAUSED BY THE EARTH'S INCREDIBLY HOT MOLTEN CORE 
SOMETIMES THE HEAT CAUSES HOT VISCOUS LAVA 
TO BURST THROUGH THE EARTH'S THIN CRUST AS A VOLCANIC ERUPTION 
AND THAT IS JUST WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING HERE IN SICILY 
FOR OVER HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
SOME EXPLOSIONS HAVE BEEN SO ENORMOUS 
THE ASH HAS BEEN FOUND NEAR ROME FIVE HUNDRED MILES AWAY 
IN FACT THE SURFACE OF OUR ENTIRE PLANET 
IS MADE UP OF A NUMBER OF MOVING PLATES 
AND ETNA SITS RIGHT ON TOP OF A DANGER ZONE 
WHERE TWO PLATES COLLIDE 
HERE ONE PLATE IS BEING PUSHED UNDER THE OTHER 
EARTH'S ACTIVE LAND VOLCANOES 
INCLUDING ETNA AND ITS INFAMOUS NEIGHBOUR MOUNT VESUVIUS 
AS EVERY SCHOOL KID KNOWS WHEN VESUVIUS ERUPTED IN SEVENTY NINE AD IT COVERED 
THE ROMAN CITY OF POMPEII WITH A THICK CLOUD OF DEADLY VOLCANIC ASH 
ITS PEOPLE WERE PRESERVED BY THE ASH WHERE THEY FELL 
AS IF FROZEN IN TIME 
UNCHANGED FOR NEARLY TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
AND JUST AS ETNA WAS PONDERED OVER BY THE PHILOSOPHER EMPEDOCLES 
THIS MOUNTAIN VESUVIUS ALSO HAD ITS OWN ERUDITE OBSERVER 
PLINY THE YOUNGER WITNESSED AND WROTE ABOUT ITS MOST FAMOUS ERUPTION 
TO THIS DAY VOLCANOLOGISTS STILL DESCRIBE HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE ERUPTIONS 
ON THE SCALE OF VESUVIUS AS PLINYIAN 
BUT FOR ME ETNA IS THE PLACE TO BE 
NOT ONLY IS IT ALMOST THREE TIMES TALLER THAN VESUVIUS IT'S FAR MORE ACTIVE 
WHILST VESUVIUS HAS BEEN DORMANT SINCE NINETEEN FORTY FOUR 
THE ERUPTIONS ON ETNA JUST KEEP ON COMING 
MOUNT ETNA EUROPE'S HIGHEST AND MOST ACTIVE VOLCANO 
EUROPE'S HIGHEST VOLCANO MOUNT ETNA IN SICILY IS 
SHOWING SIGNS OF ACTIVITY FOLLOWING TREMORS 
MOLTEN LAVA POURING FROM MOUNT ETNA IN SICILY IS CONTINUING 
TO THREATEN THE VILLAGES LYING IN ITS PATH 
RIVERS OF FIRE FLOW FROM ETNA'S ELEVEN THOUSAND FEET HIGH SUMMIT 
SWAMPING VINEYARDS AND OLIVE GROVES 
YESTERDAY THE LAVA MOVED AT AN ALARMING FIFTY FEET AN HOUR 
BUT HAS SINCE SLOWED DOWN 
IT MUST BE THE MOST SPECTACULAR FREE SHOW ON EARTH 
IT WON'T BE EASY TO PUT THINGS RIGHT 
IT'S ETNA'S CONTINUOUS ACTIVITY THAT HAS MADE IT ENDLESSLY 
FASCINATING TO ANCIENT PHILOSOPHERS AND MODERN GEOLOGISTS ALIKE 
SO THAT'S ETNA BUT WHAT ABOUT EMPEDOCLES 
WELL HE MIGHT HAVE LEANED TOWARDS RATIONAL THOUGHT 
BUT HE CAME TO A RATHER ODD END 
THE STORY GOES THAT IN ORDER TO PROVE HIS DIVINITY 
TO HIS FOLLOWERS HE THREW HIMSELF INTO THE CRATER AT THE TOP OF ETNA 
THE FIRE WAS MEANT TO PURIFY HIS BODY 
RELEASING HIS SOUL FOR IMMORTALITY 
SO NOT VERY SCIENTIFIC THEN 
OUR NEXT STORY TAKES US BACK TO THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN EIGHTY WHEN I WAS PREPARING TO GO TO UNIVERSITY 
I REMEMBER SEEING THESE POWERFUL PICTURES OF AN ERUPTION 
WREAKING HAVOC ACROSS WESTERN U. S. A. 
IT WAS MOUNT SAINT HELENS 
AND IT SHOWED US THAT HOWEVER MUCH WE THOUGHT WE KNEW ABOUT VOLCANOES WE STILL HAD A LOT TO DISCOVER 
THIS IS MOUNT SAINT HELENS 
AT THE BEGINNING OF NINETEEN EIGHTY THE MOUNTAIN STOOD ALONE 
AN ELEGANT SYMMETRICAL CONE 
A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHAT'S KNOWN AS A STRATOVOLCANO 
OVER THE LAST FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED YEARS 
SAINT HELENS HAD GROWN TO A HEIGHT OF TEN THOUSAND FEET 
BUT THIS BEAUTIFUL SYMMETRY WASN'T TO LAST 
A TRANQUIL SETTING FOR CAMPING AND HIKING 
SAINT HELENS WAS A BEAUTY SPOT POPULAR WITH NATURE LOVERS 
A PICTURESQUE LAKE TO THE NORTH WAS POPULAR FOR FISHING 
AND WAS KNOWN AS SPIRIT LAKE FOR ITS LEGENDARY MOANING NOISES 
LEGEND OR NOT AFTER OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF STILLNESS 
MOUNT SAINT HELENS RUMBLED TO LIFE 
ONE OF THE GUYS CAME RUNNING DOWNSTAIRS SAYING THAT THERE HAD BEEN A MAGNITUDE FOUR EARTHQUAKE 
REPORTED BY ONE OF THE PERMANENT MANNED OBSERVATORIES IN THE MOUNTAINS 
SOMEWHERE IN WESTERN WASHINGTON 
WE SPENT ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES ASCERTAINING THAT THE EARTHQUAKE HAD BEEN AT MOUNT SAINT HELENS 
THE AWAKENING OF THE SLEEPING GIANT 
INCREASED ITS DRAW AS A TOURIST ATTRACTION 
EARTHQUAKES AND MINOR ERUPTIONS HAD PEOPLE FLOCKING TO WATCH THE SHOW 
IT WASN'T CLEAR EXACTLY WHAT THE VOLCANO WAS GOING TO DO NEXT 
ERRING ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION THE AUTHORITIES SET UP EXCLUSION ZONES 
IN AN ATTEMPT TO KEEP THE PUBLIC OUT OF HARM'S WAY 
BUT THE INFORMATION WASN'T PRECISE ENOUGH AND PEOPLE GREW IMPATIENT 
NEWS REPORTERS WANTED THE BEST VIEW LOGGERS WANTED TO KEEP WORKING 
AND SOME OF THE LOCALS REFUSED TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES 
I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE I'LL ONLY LEAVE IF THEY TAKE ME OUT OF HERE 
THEY WILL HAVE TO COME AND GET ME 
THEY'LL GET THEMSELVES IN A GODDAMN MESS IF THEY COME AND GET TRUMAN 
PERHAPS IT WAS THE VOLCANO'S LOCATION IN A WORLD SUPERPOWER 
THAT GAVE RESIDENTS AND VISITORS ALIKE 
A FALSE SENSE OF THEIR OWN SECURITY 
GEOLOGISTS WATCHING THE MOUNTAIN OBSERVED A BULGE IN ITS UPPER NORTH SLOPE 
DUE TO A BUILD UP OF MAGMA BENEATH ITS SURFACE 
THE BULGE WAS GROWING LIKE A BLISTER BY FIVE FEET EACH DAY 
BUT WHAT NO ONE IMAGINED WAS WHAT THE GROWING BULGE WAS GOING TO DO 
IT COULD BE WITHIN HOURS 
IT COULD BE WITHIN DAYS OR EVEN UP TO A COUPLE OF MONTHS 
THIS IS NOT A GOOD SPOT TO BE STANDING 
THEN ON EIGHTEENTH MAY 
MOUNT SAINT HELENS TOOK EVERYBODY BY SURPRISE 
IT ERUPTED BUT IT ERUPTED SIDEWAYS 
WHAT SCIENTISTS BELIEVE HAPPENED WAS THAT 
AN EARTHQUAKE TRIGGERED THE BIGGEST LANDSLIDE IN RECORDED HISTORY 
IT ROARED DOWN THE NORTH FACE OF T. H. MOUNTAIN AT OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES AN HOUR 
THIS IN TURN CAUSED THE BLISTER ON THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN TO BURST RELEASING A HUGE BLAST 
OF A VOLCANO'S MOST INFAMOUS AND TERRIFYING WEAPON 
PYROCLASTIC FLOW 
THIS SURGE OF HOT GAS ASH AND ROCK 
BLASTED OUT OF THE MOUNTAIN AT OVER THREE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR 
REACHING TEMPERATURES OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DEGREES C. 
THE BLAST DEVASTATED AN AREA TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILES SQUARE 
YOU HAVE THIS HUGE ROILING CLOUD POURING DOWN THE SIDE OF THE VOLCANO 
IT'S ACTUALLY HUGGING THE GROUND BUT IT'S GENERATING HOT GAS AND ASH 
SO IT'S VERY VERY HOT YOU'RE TALKING HUNDREDS OF DEGREES CELSIUS 
THEY CARRY BLOCKS THE SIZE OF HOUSES TO ADD TO THEIR DESTRUCTIVE POWER 
REALLY THERE IS NOTHING YOU COULD DO TO MITIGATE 
THEIR IMPACT AND NOTHING YOU COULD DO TO SURVIVE 
ALTHOUGH PEOPLE ARE INCINERATED IF IN A PYROCLASTIC FLOW 
IT IS NOT THE BURNING THAT KILLS THEM IT'S THE VERY HOT GAS 
THAT THEY INHALE SO THE FIRST INHALATION WILL VIRTUALLY DESTROY YOUR RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 
AND THE SECOND ONE WILL JUST FINISH THE JOB 
SO PEOPLE REALLY DROWN IN THE LIQUID AND FLUID GENERATED IN THEIR WRECKED LUNGS 
VOLCANOLOGISTS HAD WITNESSED PYROCLASTIC FLOWS BEFORE 
BUT WHILST THE SCALE OF THE ERUPTION OF MOUNT SAINT HELENS WAS BIGGER THAN EXPECTED 
IT WAS THE SIDEWAYS BLAST THAT WAS TOTALLY UNPRECEDENTED 
MOST OF THE DEVASTATED AREA LAY TO THE NORTH OF THE SUMMIT 
FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED 
A PHOTOGRAPHER GOT SOME AMAZING FOOTAGE ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN 
THIS IS HELL ON EARTH I'M WALKING THROUGH 
HE WAS SPARED THE INITIAL BLAST BUT WAS CAUGHT UNDER THE ASH CLOUD 
BUT AT THIS MOMENT 
I HONEST TO GOD BELIEVE I'M DEAD 
MIRACULOUSLY HE SURVIVED 
IT WAS LUCKY THE VOLCANO BLEW ON A SUNDAY OR HUNDREDS OF LOGGERS 
WORKING IN THE SURROUNDING AREA WOULD ALSO HAVE MET THEIR DEATHS 
BUT MOUNT SAINT HELENS TAUGHT US ANOTHER LESSON 
FOR NINE HOURS A VERTICAL ERUPTION COLUMN FIFTEEN MILES HIGH 
SPREAD HALF A BILLION TONS OF ASH AND DEBRIS 
EASTWARD ACROSS THREE STATES 
THEN FELL TO EARTH LIKE THICK BLACK SNOW 
THIS LATEST ERUPTION SENT SHOWERS OF VOLCANIC ASH AS FAR SOUTH AS PORTLAND 
FORTY MILES FROM MOUNT SAINT HELENS 
WHERE DRIVING BECAME TREACHEROUS AS A RESULT OF FALLOUT COATING EVERYTHING WITH A FINE GREY POWDER 
RESIDENTS WERE ADVISED TO STAY INDOORS TO AVOID BREATHING IN THE DUST 
AND THERE WERE NUMEROUS TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS 
OFFICIALS HERE AND IN FIVE NORTH WESTERN OREGON COUNTIES WERE PUT ON ALERT 
I AM DECLARING A LIMITED STATE OF EMERGENCY 
I WOULD URGE FOLKS TO STAY CALM 
IF YOU ARE OUT GO HOME AND STAY HOME 
AND I AM IMPOSING A FIFTEEN M. P. H. SPEED LIMIT AT THIS TIME 
NINETEEN EIGHTIES AMERICA WAS ILL PREPARED 
THE ASH WAS DISASTROUS 
ELECTRICAL TRANSFORMERS WERE SHORT CIRCUITED 
CAUSING POWER OUTAGES 
CARS TRAINS AND AEROPLANES ALL GROUND TO A HALT 
PARALYSING CITIES AND CAUSING HAVOC FOR WEEKS 
MOUNT SAINT HELENS SHOWED JUST HOW MUCH CHAOS AN ERUPTION CAN CAUSE IN THE MODERN WORLD 
THE LATERAL BLAST DESTROYED FORESTS HOMES AND LIVES 
IT HAS BECOME THE MOST PHOTOGRAPHED AND INTENSELY STUDIED VOLCANIC EPISODE EVER 
AND OVER TWO THOUSAND SCIENTIFIC PAPERS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED ON THIS ERUPTION 
ENSURING THIS AWESOME EVENT WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN 
MOUNT SAINT HELENS WAS A CATASTROPHE WHICH TOOK EVERYONE BY SURPRISE 
BUT WHEN IT BLEW IT WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS THERE HAD BEEN A MAJOR ERUPTION 
OUR NEXT VOLCANO IS FAR MORE INSIDIOUS BECAUSE WHEN IT STRUCK 
NOBODY WAS REALLY QUITE SURE WHAT HAD HAPPENED 
LAKE NYOS CAMEROON WEST AFRICA 
A BEAUTIFUL LAKE THAT IS A SOURCE OF FRESH WATER AND FISH FOR THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE ON ITS SHORES 
THE LAKE FILLS A CRATER FORMED BY A VOLCANIC ERUPTION AROUND FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO 
BUT THIS VOLCANO'S DAYS OF WREAKING HAVOC WERE FAR FROM OVER 
ON THE EVENING OF TWENTY FIRST AUGUST NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY STRUCK 
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN A NATURAL DISASTER IN CAMEROON 
AT LEAST ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE DEAD 
I WENT DOWN TO NYOS THERE WAS NO PEOPLE 
EVERYBODY WAS DEAD 
ENTIRE VILLAGES AND THEIR LIVESTOCK HAD BEEN WIPED OUT 
THE PEOPLE HAD FALLEN DEAD WHILE COOKING OR SLEEPING 
THERE HAD BEEN JUST A FEW SURVIVORS 
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF A STRUGGLE 
THE DEATHS WERE A MYSTERY 
SITTING AMONG THE DEAD PEOPLE INSIDE THE HOUSE SOME WERE OUTSIDE 
SOME OF THEM BEHIND THE HOUSES ANIMALS EVERYWHERE 
LYING FOWLS DOGS COWS EVERYTHING 
SO I WAS CONFUSED BY THAT 
FOR THE FAMILY WE WERE FIFTY SIX 
BUT FIFTY THREE DIED 
I WENT OUTSIDE AND SAW ALL MY COWS LYING ON THE GROUND 
I WENT BACK INSIDE AND SAW MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER HAD FALLEN 
LYING NEAR A DRUM OF WATER 
EYEWITNESS REPORTS SUGGESTED THE PEOPLE AND THEIR ANIMALS AROUND THE LAKE HAD BEEN SUFFOCATED BY GAS 
THE THING WAS WHITE WHITE LIKE CLOTH 
IT DIDN'T GO UP IN THE AIR IT MOSTLY WENT DOWN NEAR THE GROUND 
BUT IF IT WAS A GAS WHAT WAS IT 
AND WHERE COULD IT HAVE COME FROM 
AFTER STUDYING THE LAKE SCIENTISTS DISCOVERED LARGE AMOUNTS OF CARBON DIOXIDE DISSOLVED IN THE WATER 
IT HAD MADE ITS WAY UP FROM DEEP WITHIN THE EARTH 
THROUGH CRACKS UNDERNEATH THE OLD VOLCANO 
WHERE ONCE LAVA WAS EJECTED NOW THERE WAS JUST GAS 
OVER THE YEARS HUGE QUANTITIES OF CARBON DIOXIDE HAD COLLECTED 
DEEP IN THE BOTTOM OF THE LAKE 
UNTIL AUGUST NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX 
FROM STUDYING FILM TAKEN STRAIGHT AFTER THE DISASTER 
SCIENTISTS SAW THERE HAD BEEN A HUGE LANDSLIDE 
THE LANDSLIDE UNLEASHED HUNDREDS OF TONS OF ROCKS INTO THE LAKE 
THEY ROLLED DOWN INTO THE WATER WHERE THE CARBON DIOXIDE WAS DISSOLVED 
THE DISTURBED GAS THEN BUBBLED UP 
WATER DROPLETS FORMED ON ITS SURFACE TURNING IT WHITE 
ONCE THE CRATER WAS FULL A DENSE CLOUD OF CARBON DIOXIDE 
HEAVIER THAN THE SURROUNDING AIR POURED OVER THE LIP OF THE CRATER 
AND RACED DOWN TOWARDS THE VILLAGE 
IT WAS NINE O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING 
THE INHABITANTS OF NYOS HAD GONE TO BED FOR THE LAST TIME 
THE GAS CREPT OVER THOSE SLEEPING IN THEIR BEDS 
IN THIS CONCENTRATION THE ODOURLESS CLOUD WAS DEADLY 
IT SUFFOCATED THE PEOPLE WHILE THEY SLEPT 
THERE WOULD BE NO TIME TO SCREAM OR CRY OUT 
IN NYOS ALL BUT SIX DIED 
THE CLOUD OF GAS TRAVELLED TO NEIGHBOURING VILLAGES 
FOR ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DEATH WAS NOW INEVITABLE 
THE MYSTERY OF LAKE NYOS HAD BEEN SOLVED 
AND NOW A SIMPLE PIPE COULD SAFELY RELEASE THE GAS FROM THE BOTTOM 
THE LAKE HAS VENTED GAS AGAIN 
BUT NOW THE CAMEROONIAN SCIENTISTS ARE IN CONTROL 
BUT NYOS'S INVISIBLE WEAPON IS NOT ITS ONLY SECRET 
UNDERSTANDING THIS LAKE IS KEY TO UNDERSTANDING HOW 
WITHOUT VOLCANOES OUR EARTH WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE 
ALL VOLCANOES EMIT HUGE QUANTITIES OF GAS 
THE STEAM YOU SEE RISING FROM THE GROUND HERE 
HAS COME FROM DEEP WITHIN THE EARTH 
IN FACT ALL THE GAS THAT FIRST FORMED OUR EARLY ATMOSPHERE 
NEARLY FOUR BILLION YEARS AGO 
CAME FROM INSIDE THE PLANET AND ESCAPED VIA VOLCANOES 
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY THOUGHT THAT WITHOUT VOLCANOES EMITTING GASES WE WOULDN'T HAVE AN ATMOSPHERE 
AND WITHOUT AN ATMOSPHERE WE WOULDN'T HAVE LIFE 
VOLCANO NUMBER FOUR COULDN'T BE MORE DIFFERENT 
IT'S BIG IN FACT IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST VOLCANOES EVER DISCOVERED 
IT MEASURES AN INCREDIBLE SIXTEEN MILES HIGH 
WHICH IS THREE TIMES TALLER THAN MOUNT EVEREST 
AND WITH A DIAMETER OF THREE HUNDRED SIXTY MILES IT'S BIGGER THAN ENGLAND 
IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHY YOU'VE NEVER SEEN IT IT'S BECAUSE IT'S ON ANOTHER PLANET 
SO HOW DID MARS END UP WITH THE BIGGEST VOLCANO IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM 
WHEN MARS FIRST FORMED IT WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TO THE COLD DEAD PLANET WE SEE TODAY 
BACK THEN IT HAD A HOT MOLTEN CORE JUST LIKE EARTH 
AND JUST LIKE THE EARTH IT HAD MASSIVE VOLCANIC EXPLOSIONS 
AS THE HEAT FROM THE CENTRE MELTED ROCK AND CAUSED ERUPTIONS 
THAT EXPLAINS WHY THERE ARE VOLCANOES ON MARS 
BUT NOT WHY THEY'RE SO MUCH BIGGER THAN THOSE ON EARTH 
THE EARTH'S SURFACE IS DIVIDED UP INTO SEVERAL TECTONIC PLATES 
OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS THESE PLATES MOVE OVER THE EARTH'S HOTSPOTS 
ALLOWING MANY VOLCANOES TO FORM AND ERUPT 
BUT MARS HAS NO TECTONIC PLATES ITS SURFACE IS FIXED 
THIS MEANS THAT HERE THERE ARE VERY FEW PLACES WHERE VOLCANOES FORM 
AND SO WHEN THEY DO THEY CREATE ENORMOUS MOUNTAINS 
OLYMPUS MONS IS THE BIGGEST 
BUT THERE'S ONE OTHER REASON WHY YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE A VOLCANO THE SIZE OF OLYMPUS MONS ON EARTH 
THE EARTH'S OUTER SHELL IS HALF AS THICK AS THE ONE ON MARS 
AND SIMPLY TOO THIN TO SUPPORT A MOUNTAIN OF THIS SIZE 
IF OLYMPUS MONS WERE ON EARTH IT WOULD SINK 
OLYMPUS MONS IS A BEAST OF A VOLCANO 
EIGHT TIMES TALLER THAN MOUNT ETNA HERE 
NOW WHAT A CLIMB THAT WOULD BE 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE TO HAVE SEEN IT IN ACTION BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE 
BOTH MARS AND OLYMPUS MONS ARE PRETTY MUCH DEAD 
WHAT WAS ONCE A HOT SEARING CENTRE 
IS NOW TOO COOL TO FUEL ITS VOLCANOES 
AND WITH IT MARS HAS LOST THE CHANCE THAT IT HAD TO DEVELOP AN EARTH LIKE ATMOSPHERE 
AND SUSTAIN COMPLEX LIFE 
MARS HAS MISSED THE BOAT 
LIFE ON MARS BY DAVID BOWIE 
BUT THE NEXT VOLCANO IS DEFINITELY ONE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD OF 
BECAUSE NO VOLCANO LIST WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT IT 
BUT THERE'S JUST A CHANCE THAT YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT KRAKATOA HAS TO OFFER 
THIS IS ANAK KRAKATOA 
IT LIES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ARCHIPELAGO OF ISLANDS THAT MAKE UP INDONESIA 
IT'S A NEW ISLAND FORMED BY A VOLCANO IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES 
THIS FOOTAGE WAS CAUGHT BY A CAMERAMAN WHO RUSHED TO THE SCENE 
WHAT STOOD HERE TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO WAS A VOLCANO ON A DIFFERENT SCALE 
KRAKATOA ITSELF 
INDONESIA'S STRUNG OUT ALONG A LINE WHERE TWO PLATES ARE MOVING TOGETHER 
JUST LIKE THE PLATES UNDER ETNA 
THIS MAKES THESE ISLANDS A HOTBED OF VOLCANIC ACTION 
KRAKATOA WAS SEPARATED FROM ITS NEAREST HUMAN NEIGHBOURS 
BY A THIRTY MILE STRETCH OF THE INDIAN OCEAN 
WHICH MIGHT REASONABLY HAVE BEEN ASSUMED 
TO BE GOOD PROTECTION FROM WHATEVER THE VOLCANO MIGHT DELIVER 
BUT THIS WAS NOT THE CASE 
ON THE MORNING OF AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE 
AFTER TWENTY HOURS OF CONTINUOUS ERUPTION 
KRAKATOA CULMINATED IN FOUR HUGE EXPLOSIONS 
THESE BLASTS LED TO MASSIVE SURGES OF PYROCLASTIC FLOW 
THAT RIPPED ACROSS THAT THIRTY MILES OF OPEN WATER 
REACHING THE SHORES OF SUMATRA 
BUT HOW COULD THE PYROCLASTIC FLOWS HAVE TRAVELLED SO FAR ACROSS THE OCEAN 
WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT PYROCLASTIC FLOWS AND THE FACT THAT 
ON LAND THEY CAN TRAVEL GREAT DISTANCES AWAY FROM THE VOLCANO 
WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW PYROCLASTIC FLOWS BEHAVE 
ONCE THEY INTERACT WITH WATER 
IF THEY WOULD GO UNDERWATER OVER THE SURFACE OF THE WATER 
IF THEY WOULD EXPLODE BY SOME KIND OF COMPLEX INTERACTION SO THE BEHAVIOUR WAS VERY POORLY UNDERSTOOD 
THIS EXPERIMENT ATTEMPTS TO RECONSTRUCT WHAT HAPPENED AT KRAKATOA 
IT COULD OFFER VITAL CLUES AS TO HOW THE PYROCLASTIC SURGES CROSSED THE SEA 
FIRST A HOPPER WITH HOT ASH IS RAISED ABOVE A CHUTE 
AT THE BOTTOM A TANK OF COLD WATER 
WHEN THE ASH IS RELEASED IT WILL SURGE JUST LIKE THE FLOWS DID AT KRAKATOA 
USING HIGH SPEED CAMERAS WE CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT HITS THE WATER 
THE HEAVY ASH SINKS 
BUT THE LIGHTER ASH BLASTS ACROSS THE WATER ON A BED OF STEAM 
THE STEAM CREATED BY THE HOT ASH HITTING THE WATER 
NOT ONLY STOPS IT SINKING BUT ACTUALLY SEEMS TO PROPEL IT FORWARD 
THIS IS WHAT SCIENTISTS BELIEVE HAPPENED AT KRAKATOA 
THE PYROCLASTIC FLOW SURGED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AND ACROSS THE OCEAN 
AT UP TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES AN HOUR 
AS THESE SURGES HIT THE SUMATRAN COASTS THEY KILLED THOUSANDS 
THE LAST BLAST OF THE ERUPTION WAS SO LOUD 
IT WAS HEARD THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY IN AUSTRALIA AND SRI LANKA 
IT WAS THE LOUDEST SOUND IN RECORDED HISTORY 
BUT THERE WAS MORE 
THE ERUPTION OF KRAKATOA WAS SO EXTREME 
IT LITERALLY BLEW THE ISLAND APART 
AS IT COLLAPSED MILLIONS OF TONS OF ASH AND PUMICE 
POURED INTO THE SEA 
THIS TRIGGERED A TSUNAMI MORE DESTRUCTIVE THAN ANYTHING BEFORE 
THE WAVE WHICH WOULD HAVE RISEN TO ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FEET HIGH 
AS IT RUSHED INTO INLETS AND RIVER VALLEYS 
REACHED NEARLY THREE MILES INLAND 
ON THE NEARBY ISLANDS OF JAVA AND SUMATRA 
SIDNEY BAKER WAS ELEVEN YEARS OLD WHEN KRAKATOA BLEW 
HE WAS ON HIS FATHER'S BOAT JUST MILES AWAY 
THIS RECORDING OF SIDNEY WAS MADE IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
OUR CRAFT WAS THE NEAREST SURVIVING SHIP TO THE ISLAND 
OTHERS THAT WERE NEARER WERE LOST 
IT WAS A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE 
WE PASSED OVER ALL KINDS OF DEBRIS 
VILLAGES THAT HAD BEEN SWEPT FROM THEIR LOCATIONS 
DEAD BODIES GALORE WE HAD A JOB DODGING THEM 
ADJECTIVES FAIL TO DESCRIBE THE RACKET AND TURMOIL 
YOU DON'T LOOK AT A TIDAL WAVE A TIDAL WAVE LOOKS AT YOU 
KRAKATOA BLEW AWAY OVER TWO THIRDS OF THE VOLCANO 
ONLY AN OUTCROP OF ROCK WAS LEFT STANDING 
IT WAS A TERRIFYING ORDEAL THAT LED TO THE DEATHS OF AS MANY AS FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 
AND IT DELIVERED ITS MOST CATASTROPHIC BLOWS BY THE 
VERY THING THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT WOULD PROTECT THEM THE SEA 
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT KRAKATOA THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY IT'S SO INGRAINED IN OUR CULTURE 
KRAKATOA WAS IN MANY WAYS THE FIRST DISASTER EXPERIENCED AS A GLOBAL EVENT 
WHEN PRESIDENT LINCOLN WAS ASSASSINATED LESS THAN TWENTY YEARS EARLIER 
THE NEWS TOOK NEARLY TWO WEEKS TO CROSS THE ATLANTIC 
WHEN KRAKATOA BLEW 
THE NEWS SPREAD ACROSS THE GLOBE IN A MATTER OF HOURS 
ALL THANKS TO THE INVENTION OF A RELIABLE 
NEW UNDERWATER TELEGRAPH SYSTEM 
ONE TELEGRAPH FROM THE INDONESIAN CAPITAL READ SIMPLY 
WHERE ONCE MOUNT KRAKATOA STOOD THE SEA NOW PLAYS 
OUR NEXT VOLCANO MAKES US THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THE POWER TO CHANGE OUR PLANET 
WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE DESTRUCTIVE FORCE THAT VOLCANOES POSSESS 
BUT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF FAR MORE THAN JUST WREAKING HAVOC 
AND NONE MORE SO THAN KILAUEA IN HAWAII 
HAWAII 
TROPICAL BEACHES HOLIDAY PARADISE AND THE WORLD'S MOST ACTIVE VOLCANO 
MOUNT KILAUEA 
THE MAIN ISLAND IS ONE OF THE GREAT NATURAL WONDERS OF THE WORLD AND IT'S NOTHING BUT VOLCANO 
SO JUST HOW DID IT GET HERE 
HAWAII SITS ON TOP OF A HOT SPOT WHERE THE HEAT AT THE EARTH'S CORE 
RISES UP THROUGH THE MANTLE AS A PLUME OF SCORCHING ROCK 
BUT IT BEGAN LIFE ON THE OCEAN BED 
THEN THE VOLCANO SPEWED FORTH LAVA INTO THE COLD SEA 
IT COOLED AND SOLIDIFIED LAYER UPON LAYER 
OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS THE VOLCANO SLOWLY BUILT INTO 
AN ENORMOUS UNDERWATER MOUNTAIN 
WHICH EVENTUALLY ROSE OUT OF THE OCEAN TO BECOME AN ISLAND 
AND WHAT AN ISLAND HAWAII IS 
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS JUST THE TIP OF AN ENORMOUS STRUCTURE 
IF YOU WERE TO MEASURE MOUNT KILAUEA FROM THE SEA BED 
THEN IT WOULD REACH A HEIGHT OF OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FEET 
RIVALLING MOUNT KILIMANJARO 
IF IT WASN'T FOR VOLCANOES PRODUCING LAVA FROM UNDER THE EARTH'S CRUST 
AND BUILDING THESE ISLANDS THERE WOULDN'T BE A PLACE CALLED HAWAII AT ALL 
SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ISLANDS IN THE WORLD WOULDN'T BE HERE EITHER 
MAURITIUS THE GALAPAGOS AND THE MALDIVES WOULD NEVER HAVE EXISTED 
WHILE THE VOLCANOES ON THESE ISLANDS HAVE BEEN DORMANT 
MOUNT KILAUEA IS STILL GOING STRONG 
IT MAY PRODUCE THE GREATEST FIREWORK DISPLAY ON THE PLANET 
BUT KILAUEA IS RELATIVELY GOOD NATURED FOR A VOLCANO 
RATHER THAN EXPLOSIONS THAT BLOW MOUNTAINS APART 
IT SPEWS LAVA IN SPECTACULAR FIERY FOUNTAINS 
SO YOU GET MAXIMUM EFFECT BUT MINIMUM DANGER 
HAWAII'S VOLCANOES ARE STILL SPEWING OUT NEW MATERIAL AND MAKING MORE LAND 
THERE'S A NEW ISLAND GROWING RIGHT NOW 
IT'S ABOUT THREE THOUSAND FEET BELOW THE OCEAN'S SURFACE 
IF IT KEEPS ON GROWING AT THE PRESENT RATE 
IT WILL EMERGE OUT OF THE SEA IN ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND YEARS' TIME 
BUT FORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT THAT LONG 
TO SEE SUCH A MAGNIFICENT EVENT THANKS TO VOLCANO NUMBER SEVEN 
APTLY NAMED AFTER A NORSE FIRE GIANT THIS VOLCANO IS SURTSEY 
IT ERUPTED OUT OF THE CHILLY ICELANDIC WATERS IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE 
ICELAND IS FAMOUS FOR ITS ICY WASTELANDS AND HUGE GLACIERS 
IT'S ALSO AN AREA OF INTENSIVE VOLCANIC ACTIVITY 
EARNING IT THE NAME THE LAND OF FIRE AND ICE 
IN SOME PLACES THE PLATES THAT MAKE UP THE EARTH'S CRUST MOVE TOWARDS EACH OTHER 
BUT HERE THE PLATES ARE MOVING APART 
TEARING OPEN GIANT CRACKS AND FISSURES 
THE MOST FAMOUS OF THESE GREAT SPLITS IS THE MID ATLANTIC RIDGE 
ICELAND SITS ASTRIDE THE RIDGE 
IT'S BEING PULLED APART AT THE RATE OF ABOUT AN INCH A YEAR 
THROUGH THE SPLIT ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MAGMA RISE UP 
BUT MOST OF THE MID ATLANTIC RIDGE RUNS ALONG THE OCEAN FLOOR 
HERE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF VOLCANOES ERUPTING ON THE SEABED 
THE WATER PRESSURE IS SO HIGH THAT GAS TRAPPED IN THE LAVA 
CAN'T EXPAND EXPLOSIVELY SO THE VOLCANOES GO UNNOTICED 
BUT SOMETIMES JUST LIKE HAWAII 
THEY BUILD UP AND BREAK THROUGH THE OCEAN SURFACE 
THIS DRAMATIC MOMENT OF CREATION 
IS JUST WHAT THE CAMERAS CAUGHT IN THE WINTER OF SIXTY THREE 
THIS IS A HYDROVOLCANIC ERUPTION 
IT PRODUCED AN ERUPTION COLUMN OF STEAM AND ASH FOUR MILES HIGH 
THE COLUMN COULD BE SEEN IN REYKJAVIK SEVENTY MILES AWAY 
THE NEW ISLAND'S BIRTH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY DRAMATIC FLASHES OF LIGHTNING 
AND WHEN THE SHOW WAS OVER 
WHERE ONCE THERE HAD ONLY BEEN OCEAN APPEARED THE TINY ISLAND OF SURTSEY 
THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY REMARKABLE THAT VOLCANOES LIKE SURTSEY BRING TO MIND 
THIS STEAM ON ETNA IS COMING OUT OF HOLES CALLED FUMAROLES 
WHICH EMIT A NOXIOUS MIX OF SULPHUROUS GAS 
THIS MIGHT SEEM THE LAST PLACE THAT ANYTHING WOULD WANT TO LIVE 
BUT ON THE DEPTHS OF THE OCEAN FLOOR IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT STORY 
SOME UNDERWATER VOLCANOES PRODUCE BLACK SULPHUROUS CLOUDS OF STEAM 
AT DEPTHS OF AROUND FIFTEEN MILES 
AND TEMPERATURES OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DEGREES C. THESE ARE BLACK SMOKERS 
BLACK SMOKERS PROVIDE A UNIQUE HOME FOR EXTRAORDINARY CREATURES 
FROM SMALL BLIND CRABS TO TUBE WORMS ELEVEN FEET LONG 
THESE WEIRD ANIMALS ARE LIVING OFF BACTERIA 
IN THESE HOT HOSTILE SULPHUROUS WATERS 
SUCH BACTERIA ARE NOW THOUGHT TO BE THE FIRST LIVING ORGANISMS ON THE PLANET 
AND THUS IT COULD BE THAT THE VERY EARLIEST FORMS OF LIFE ON EARTH MAY 
HAVE STARTED OUT IN THESE VOLCANOES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN 
SO IT SEEMS THAT WE DON'T JUST OWE OUR ATMOSPHERE TO VOLCANOES 
BUT THAT THEY MAY BE THE SOURCE OF LIFE ITSELF 
BUT ICELAND'S VOLCANIC PAST HAS ONE MORE CURIOUS TWIST 
IT PROVIDED THE INSPIRATION FOR THE FINAL PART OF RICHARD WAGNER'S OPERA THE RING CYCLE 
CALLED GOTTERDAMMERUNG OR TWILIGHT OF THE GODS 
SO WE'VE SEEN HOW INCREDIBLY POWERFUL AND UNPREDICTABLE VOLCANOES CAN BE 
YOU MUST BE WONDERING WHY DO PEOPLE LIVE IN THEIR SHADOWS 
THE TRUTH IS THAT VOLCANIC SOILS CAN BE THE MOST FERTILE IN THE WORLD 
ON ETNA DOWN THERE ON THE PLAIN PEOPLE ENJOY RICH HARVESTS OF OLIVES ORANGES AND GRAPES 
PEOPLE ALWAYS HAVE AND PROBABLY ALWAYS WILL 
MAKE THEIR HOMES IN THE SHADOW OF VOLCANOES 
WHICH MEANS THAT PREDICTING WHEN ONE IS GOING TO ERUPT 
HAS LONG BEEN THE HOLY GRAIL OF GEOLOGISTS LIKE MYSELF 
IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE IN PINATUBO WE HAD A BREAKTHROUGH 
MOUNT PINATUBO IN THE PHILIPPINES HAD BEEN DORMANT FOR SO LONG 
PEOPLE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN IT WAS A VOLCANO 
THIRTY THOUSAND HAD MADE THEIR HOMES IN SMALL VILLAGES ON ITS FERTILE SLOPES 
THERE WAS A HUGE U. S. AIR FORCE BASE JUST FIFTEEN MILES FROM THE SUMMIT 
THEN IN APRIL NINETEEN NINETY ONE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER FIVE HUNDRED YEARS 
THE VOLCANO RUMBLED INTO ACTION WITH A SERIES OF SMALL EXPLOSIONS 
AN INTERNATIONAL TEAM OF GEOLOGISTS TOOK THESE WARNING SIGNS SERIOUSLY 
AND SPRANG INTO ACTION 
THEY TOOK MEASUREMENTS OF THE SEISMIC ACTIVITY BENEATH THE VOLCANO 
AT THE SAME TIME THEY DETECTED A TENFOLD INCREASE 
IN THE EMISSION OF SULPHUR DIOXIDE ON THE SUMMIT 
ALL THE SIGNS POINTED TOWARDS AN IMMINENT ERUPTION 
BY STUDYING THE SURROUNDING ROCKS 
THE TEAM WORKED OUT THAT PINATUBO'S PAST ERUPTIONS HAD BEEN HUGE 
THIS WAS ALARMING NEWS 
NOW TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIVED DIRECTLY IN THE VOLCANO'S FIRING LINE 
BY JUNE PINATUBO'S ASH ERUPTIONS WERE ALMOST CONTINUOUS 
AND A MASS EVACUATION WAS ORDERED 
EVERYONE WITHIN TWENTY MILES OF THE SUMMIT 
NEARLY SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE MOVED 
IT WAS JUST IN TIME 
HOURS AFTER THE LAST PEOPLE LEFT 
PINATUBO BLEW IN ONE OF THE BIGGEST ERUPTIONS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
A COLUMN OF MOLTEN ROCK BOILING MUD AND VOLCANIC ASH 
SHOOTS THOUSANDS OF FEET IN THE AIR 
AS MOUNT PINATUBO CONTINUES TO ERUPT AFTER SIX HUNDRED YEARS' LYING DORMANT 
ASH IS FALLING AS FAR AS FOUR HUNDRED MILES FROM THE VOLCANO 
AND REPEATED EARTHQUAKES ADD TO THE CHAOS 
PEOPLE TRY TO ESCAPE IN ANY WAY THEY CAN 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND REFUGEES ARRIVED TODAY IN THE CAPITAL MANILA 
PYROCLASTIC FLOWS DEVASTATED AN AREA OF FORTY SQUARE MILES 
AND FILLED UP CANYONS CREATING A FLAT FEATURELESS PLAIN 
BUT THEY KILLED NO ONE 
CONDITIONS WORSENED WHEN TORRENTIAL RAIN TURNED 
VAST QUANTITIES OF VOLCANIC ASH INTO THICK MUDFLOWS OR LAHARS 
THESE MUDFLOWS CAN BE LETHAL 
AS A MUCH SMALLER ERUPTION IN COLOMBIA SIX YEARS EARLIER HAD REVEALED 
B. B. C. NEWS AT SIX O'CLOCK 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ONE ESTIMATE SAYS TWENTY THOUSAND 
ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN KILLED IN SOUTH AMERICA AFTER THE ERUPTION OF A VOLCANO IN COLOMBIA 
THE TOWN OF ARMERO IS BURIED UNDER SIX FEET OF MUD AND WATER 
AND MANY OF ITS TWENTY THREE THOUSAND INHABITANTS ARE MISSING 
HERE AT MOUNT PINATUBO THE MUDFLOWS HAD DESTROYED EVERY BRIDGE 
WITHIN THE EVACUATION ZONE AND SEVERAL TOWNS WERE PARTLY BURIED 
WHILST PROPERTY WAS DEVASTATED 
THIS TIME THE PEOPLE WERE OUT OF HARM'S WAY 
PINATUBO DID TAKE ITS TOLL 
THREE HUNDRED TWENTY PEOPLE WERE KILLED BY COLLAPSING ROOFS 
AND FROM SICKNESS IN REFUGEE CAMPS 
THE EVACUATION AND LOSS OF LAND AND PROPERTY WAS DEVASTATING 
BUT THESE PEOPLE DID SURVIVE 
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WITHOUT THE SUCCESSFUL PREDICTION AND EVACUATION 
TENS OF THOUSANDS WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED 
FOR THE FIRST TIME 
VOLCANOLOGISTS HAD ACTUALLY SAVED PEOPLE'S LIVES ON A MASSIVE SCALE 
PINATUBO WAS A TURNING POINT FOR ME A YEAR LATER WE WERE BACK HERE ON ETNA 
TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER INFORMATION ABOUT EARTHQUAKES AND VOLCANOES 
WE FIGURED IF WE COULD UNDERSTAND BETTER HOW EARTH TREMORS AND VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS 
RELATE TO EACH OTHER WE COULD MAKE BETTER PREDICTIONS ABOUT HOW THE VOLCANO WAS GONNA BEHAVE 
BUT SOMETIMES VOLCANOES ERUPT WITH SUCH POWER 
AS TO MAKE ALL PREDICTIONS COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT 
CATASTROPHE ON A GLOBAL SCALE IS INEVITABLE 
TAMBORA WAS ONE OF THESE 
THIS IS THE BEAUTIFUL ISLAND OF SUMBAWA INDONESIA 
IT'S THE SITE OF THE LARGEST VOLCANIC ERUPTION IN RECORDED HISTORY 
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY TAMBORA ON INDONESIA 
HAD BEEN RUMBLING AWAY FOR THREE YEARS 
NATIVE PRIESTS ON THE NEARBY ISLAND OF JAVA 
INTERPRETED THIS AS A SIGN THE EUROPEANS WOULD LEAVE 
THEY WERE WRONG 
WHEN THE MOUNTAIN FINALLY BLEW IN APRIL ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
IT DID SO ON AN INCREDIBLE SCALE 
THE ERUPTION WAS THIRTY TIMES BIGGER THAN MOUNT SAINT HELENS 
AND NEARLY FOUR TIMES BIGGER THAN KRAKATOA 
WHAT IT LEFT BEHIND WAS A MASSIVE CRATER A CALDERA 
FOUR THOUSAND FEET DEEP AND FOUR MILES ACROSS 
THE ASH WAS SO THICK IN THE ATMOSPHERE 
THAT AN AREA ONE HUNDRED NINETY MILES AROUND TAMBORA 
WAS IN TOTAL DARKNESS FOR THREE DAYS 
TO THE PEOPLE OF INDONESIA IT MUST HAVE FELT LIKE THE WORLD HAD ENDED 
AND FOR TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE CAUGHT IN THE INITIAL BLAST IT HAD 
BUT THIS WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING 
THE ERUPTION EMITTED HUGE QUANTITIES OF STEAM AND SULPHUR DIOXIDE 
HIGH UP IN THE STRATOSPHERE 
THIS FORMED A VEIL OF SULPHURIC ACID DROPLETS 
WHICH REFLECTED THE SUN'S LIGHT 
THIS MEANT THE AMOUNT OF HEAT REACHING THE EARTH WAS GREATLY REDUCED 
SO THE MOST SERIOUS OUTCOME OF TAMBORA WAS THE GLOBAL EFFECT IT HAD ON THE WEATHER 
IT UPSET THE MONSOON LEADING TO DROUGHT AND THEN FLOODING IN INDIA 
IN EUROPE THE FOLLOWING MONTHS WERE SO COLD AND WET 
THAT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTEEN BECAME KNOWN AS THE YEAR WITHOUT SUMMER 
BROWN SNOW FELL IN HUNGARY AND YELLOW SNOW FELL IN ITALY 
FROM THE U. S. TO EUROPE CROPS FAILED 
AND ACROSS THE WORLD FAMINE AND DISEASE KILLED THOUSANDS 
THIS WAS A VOLCANIC ERUPTION THAT SHOOK THE ENTIRE PLANET 
BUT THE MEMORY OF TAMBORA IS ETCHED INTO A CULTURE IN SURPRISING WAYS 
LORD BYRON WAS IN SWITZERLAND DURING THE SUMMER OF ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTEEN 
AND HIS POEM 
I HAD A DREAM WHICH WAS NOT ALL A DREAM 
THE BRIGHT SUN WAS EXTINGUISHED 
AND THE STARS DID WANDER DARKLING IN THE ETERNAL SPACE 
THROUGHOUT THE CRISIS NOBODY KNEW WHAT HAD CAUSED IT 
THIS DIDN'T STOP PEOPLE SPECULATING 
SOME BLAMED THE DECLINE IN MORALITY AND CHURCH ATTENDANCE 
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HAD MADE THE LINK BETWEEN VOLCANIC ACTIVITY 
AND THE WEATHER SOME THIRTY YEARS EARLIER 
BUT NOBODY TOOK HIM SERIOUSLY 
IT WASN'T UNTIL THE NINETEEN TWENTIES ONE HUNDRED YEARS LATER 
THAT CLIMATOLOGISTS FINALLY MADE THE LINK BETWEEN THE ERUPTION OF TAMBORA AND THE YEAR WITHOUT SUMMER 
SO WE HAVE SEEN NINE EXTRAORDINARY VOLCANOES 
EACH ONE WITH ITS OWN SECRETS AND SURPRISES 
BUT WHAT OF THE TENTH 
THERE'S ONE VOLCANO THAT'S SO BIG WE DON'T THINK OF IT AS A VOLCANO AT ALL 
WE THINK OF IT AS A NATIONAL PARK 
IN FACT IT WASN'T UNTIL THE EIGHTIES THAT SCIENTISTS REALISED ITS TRUE NATURE 
IT IS A SUPER VOLCANO 
YELLOWSTONE WAS AMERICA'S FIRST NATIONAL PARK 
FOUNDED IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO ITS FAMOUS GEYSERS AND HOT SPRINGS 
KEEP THE VISITORS FLOCKING TO THIS DAY 
BUT WHAT MOST OF THEM DON'T REALISE 
IS THAT THIS GEOTHERMAL ACTIVITY IS A SIGN OF YELLOWSTONE'S TRUE NATURE 
THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS PEACEFUL SPOT WAS DISCOVERED BY GEOLOGIST ROBERT CHRISTIANSEN 
I FIRST CAME TO YELLOWSTONE IN THE MID NINETEEN SIXTIES TO BE A PART OF A MAJOR RESTUDY 
OF THE GEOLOGY OF YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK 
BUT AT THAT POINT I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WE WOULD FIND 
CHRISTIANSEN SAW EVIDENCE THAT THERE HAD BEEN VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS AT YELLOWSTONE 
BUT HE COULDN'T FIND THE VOLCANO 
IF YELLOWSTONE HAD A VOLCANO WHERE WAS IT 
WE REALISED THAT YELLOWSTONE HAD BEEN AN ANCIENT VOLCANIC SYSTEM 
WE SUSPECTED IT HAD BEEN A CALDERA VOLCANO 
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THE CALDERA WAS OR HOW LARGE IT WAS 
BUT THEN CHRISTIANSEN HAD A STROKE OF LUCK 
NASA TESTED SOME INFRARED SURVEYING EQUIPMENT ON YELLOWSTONE 
WHAT WAS SO EXCITING ABOUT LOOKING AT THE REMOTE SENSING IMAGERY 
WAS THE SENSE THAT SHOWED IT IN ONE SWEEPING VIEW 
OF WHAT THIS TRULY WAS 
FROM THE AIR THE PHOTOS SHOWED A CALDERA 
FORTY MILES ACROSS AND TWENTY FIVE MILES WIDE 
IT ENCOMPASSED ALMOST THE ENTIRE PARK 
CHRISTIANSEN HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE VOLCANO FROM THE GROUND BECAUSE IT WAS SO BIG 
IT APPEARED THAT WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT YELLOWSTONE 
WAS AN ERUPTION ON AN EXTRAORDINARY SCALE 
THE MAGMA BENEATH THIS VOLCANO 
HAD BUILT UP OVER HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
FORMING A VAST RESERVOIR OF MOLTEN ROCK 
WHEN IT DID FINALLY ERUPT 
ITS BLAST WAS HUNDREDS OF TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN A NORMAL VOLCANO 
SO MUCH MAGMA WAS THROWN OUT 
THAT THE ROOF OF THE CHAMBER COLLAPSED FORMING A HUGE CRATER 
A CALDERA 
THIS IS WHAT THE PHOTO FROM THE AIR REVEALED A SUPERVOLCANO 
THE SCALE OF YELLOWSTONE 
DWARFS WHAT WE NORMALLY THINK OF AS A VOLCANO 
EVEN EUROPE'S BIGGEST MOUNT ETNA WHICH I'M CLIMBING IS TINY BY COMPARISON 
I'VE FINALLY REACHED ITS SUMMIT 
ELEVEN THOUSAND FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL 
UP HERE ON THE TOP OF ETNA I'M ON THE SUMMIT OF A MOUNTAIN 
THAT'S TWENTY FIVE MILES ACROSS AND TWO MILES HIGH WHICH IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE 
EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN HERE LOADS OF TIMES I STILL GET THIS FANTASTIC 
SENSATION AS I COME OVER THAT LIP AND I STARE INTO THIS ACTIVE CRATER 
UNTIL YOU THINK THAT IS 
THAT THE CALDERA LEFT BEHIND BY THE LAST ERUPTION AT YELLOWSTONE 
WAS TWICE THE SIZE OF THIS ENTIRE MOUNTAIN 
THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN ERUPTION THIS BIG ARE HARD TO COMPREHEND 
THE LAST SUPER VOLCANIC EVENT 
WAS THE ERUPTION OF TOBA IN INDONESIA SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
A SUPER ERUPTION IN TODAY'S DENSELY POPULATED PLANET 
WOULD BE APOCALYPTIC 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF U. S. CITIZENS 
WOULD PERISH BENEATH THE RESULTING ASH CLOUD 
AN ERUPTION ON THIS SCALE WOULD HAVE CONSEQUENCES FAR BEYOND AMERICA 
THIS PROJECTION SHOWS HOW HUGE QUANTITIES OF SULPHUR DIOXIDE 
EJECTED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE WOULD COVER THE GLOBE WITHIN THREE WEEKS 
THE EFFECT ON THE PLANET'S WEATHER WOULD BE LIKE TAMBORA 
BUT ON A FAR GREATER SCALE AS THIS PROJECTION SHOWS 
AN AVERAGE DROP IN GLOBAL TEMPERATURES OF FIVE DEGREES 
WOULD HAVE A CATASTROPHIC EFFECT ON AGRICULTURE 
LEADING TO A GLOBAL SHORTAGE OF FOOD 
A SUPER VOLCANIC ERUPTION 
MIGHT KILL MORE PEOPLE THAN ALL PREVIOUS ERUPTIONS COMBINED 
THERE IS OF COURSE ONE KEY MYSTERY WHICH THAT SUPERVOLCANO HAS YET TO REVEAL 
IT'S A MYSTERY THAT COULD AFFECT US ALL 
WHAT NO ONE KNOWS IS YELLOWSTONE IS GONNA BLOW 
AND WHAT SCALE 
THIS WAS THE QUESTION THAT CHRISTIANSEN SET OUT TO TRY AND ANSWER 
BY EXAMINING LAYERS OF ASH IN THE PARK 
HE DISCOVERED THAT YELLOWSTONE HAD ERUPTED THREE TIMES IN THE PAST 
TWO MILLION YEARS AGO TWELVE MILLION YEARS AGO AND SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
QUITE AMAZINGLY WE REALISED THERE WAS A CYCLE OF CALDERA FORMING ERUPTIONS 
THESE HUGE VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS ABOUT EVERY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS 
BECAUSE THE LAST ONE WAS AROUND SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO 
SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE WE ARE DUE ANOTHER EXPLOSION ANY TIME NOW 
BEFORE YOU BUILD A BUNKER IN YOUR BACK GARDEN 
AT THE MOMENT WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO MAKE A PREDICTION 
WHAT'S MORE WE COULD BE OUT BY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS 
BUT IN THE MEANTIME IT DOES MAKE FOR SOME FANTASTIC DISASTER MOVIES
