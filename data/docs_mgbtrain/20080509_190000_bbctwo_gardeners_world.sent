BE 
M. U. P. MORE DISCIPLINED AND MORE BE MUCH MORE DISCIPLINED AND

THE ZONE 
I'M TRYING TO FEEL MY WAY 
THROUGH THIS 
KEEPING AN EYE ON US 
IS THE ORGANISER CHRISTINE THEY THEY ARE MARKED ON A FIRST SECOND 
THIRD AND FOURTH BASE AND IT IS ON 
WHETHER THEY HAVE INTERPRETED THE 
SCHEDULE AND THEY HAVE GOT COLOUR 
AND HARMONY AND DESIGN THEY BOTH 
THOUGHT ABOUT THEIR DESIGNS IN 
DIFFERENT WAYS VERY MUCH SO YOU YOU KNOW YOU CAN MAKE A HOLE IN THE 
OASIS AND THEN PUT ANOTHER PLANT IN 
YOU SHOULD NOT PUT IT IN THE SAME 
HOLE 
THAT IS A GOOD COMMENTS HE HOLE 
ABOUT PUTTING A STEM IN AND 
THEN YOU WANT TO REMOVE IT NOT TO 
PUT ANOTHER STEM BACK IN IN THE 
SAME HOLE BECAUSE THE FOAM DOES 
COMPRESS AND SO IT 
DON'T DROP IT JOE 
LOOK AT THAT 
IN THE SUN LIGHT DOESN'T THAT LOOK 
GOOD

GAMES CONSOLE BUT I GOT A 
POLYTUNNEL INSTEAD THE NAME OF MY

IT STARTS WITH THE BRONZE AGE AND 
IT FORMS A TIMELINE GOING TUDOR 
ELIZABETH THAN WORLD WAR WITH 
SHRAP NECESSARILY AND THEN ALL THE 
PLANTS FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES AT 
THE END IS A FORMAL GARDEN AND I'VE 
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT SUSTAINABILITY 
AND IT IS RECYCLABLE HERE ARE SOME 
OF THE PLANTS I'M GROWING THIS IS 
THE EQUIVALENT OF BERRYFIELDS

EMPHASIS OF MY LIFE AND ME AND MOOM 
FAMILY ARE READY FOR IT 
WE'LL SEE 
HOW THEY GET WON THEIR PITCHING 
LATER GET ON WITH THEIR 
PITCHING LATER 
THIS YEAR THE WEATHER HASN'T BEEN 
KIND TO EXHIBITORS A COLD WET 
SPRING AND LOWLIGHT LEVELS HAVE 
MEANT THAT GROWERS HAVE REALLY HAD 
THEIR WORK CUT OUT TO GET THEIR 
PLANTS TO PERFORM LAST YEAR 
POTTERTONS OF LINCOLNSHIRE WON BEST 
IN SHOW BUT THIS YEAR'S BEEN 
REALLY DIFFICULT TO COME UP TO THE 
SAME HIGH STANDARD 
THIS IS OUR THIRD YEAR EXHIBITING 
AT MALVERN FLOWER SHOW THIS YEAR 
HAS BEEN HORRENDOUS FOR US AS A 
FAMILY AND A NURSERY OUR LITTLE 
GIRL BROKE HER LEG AND WE HAD AN 
ERG DOWN THE ROAD WHICH WAS 
TERRIFYING BUT EVERYTHING WAS FINE 
JUST ONE PAYNE OF GLASS VERY LUCKY 
IT IS NOT EXACTLY GOING TO PLAN 
THIS YEAR THE WEATHER HAS 
CERTAINLY MADE THE PLANTS SLOWER 
THAN NORMAL NORMALLY WE WOULD HAVE 
A LOT LARGER RANGE OF PLANTS TO PUT 
ON DISPLAY WE JUST HOPE WE HAVE A 
SUFFICIENT NUMBER TO FILL THE AREA 
THAT WE'VE GOT 
MY PARENTS STARTED A NURSERY IN THE 
EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES HAVING BEEN AWAY 
TRAVELLING AROUND THE WORLD I CAME 
BACK HOME MY FATHER SAID HAVE YOU 
GOT A JOB I SAID NO AND HE SAID 
CAN YOU MIX SOME SOIL I'VE BEEN 
MIX MANAGER SOIL EVER SINCE JACQUI 
WAS WORKING AT THE LOCAL CHEMIST 
ONE DAY I PLUCKED UP COURAGE TO ASK 
HER OUT FOR A DATE IN THE EVENING 
I TOOK HER TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE 
WHERE I WAS BUILDING A ROCKERY SHE 
ENJOYED THAT SO MUCH SHE STAYED 
WITH ME EVER SINCE 
IS YES NEARLY 
LIKE THAT 
WHEN WE WON BEST IN SHOW AT MALVERN 
LAST YEAR WE WERE STUNNED IT'S AN 
INCREDIBLE ACHIEVEMENT CONSIDERING 
THERE ARE OVER ONE HUNDRED NURSE R. I. S. WE 
COULDN'T BELIEVE IT THEN AND WE 
STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT 
THIS YEAR WE THOUGHT WEE WOULD DO 
THINGS DIFFERENT TO LAST YEAR AS 
IN PREVIOUS YEARS WE ARE USING 
IMITATION STONE THIS IS STONE 
THAT'S BEEN BUILT OUT OF FIBREGLASS 
AND REINFORCED CONCRETE IT LOOKS 
LIKE A VERY LARGE PIECE OF STONE 
BUT IT'S HOLLOW THIS IS A GOOD 
ENOUGH IMITATION TO FOOL SOME OF 
THE R. H. S. JUDGES ONE GENTLEMAN SWORE 
BLIND THIS IS THE REAL STONE WE 
ASKED HIM TO KNOCK IT AND HE SAW IT 
WAS HOLLOW WE ALWAYS LIKE TO SHOW 
OUR PLANTS IN NATURAL SETTING TO 
EDUCATE THE PEOPLE LIKING AT THE 
STAND WE LIKE TO SHOW PLANTS THAT 
ARE NATURALLY IN FLOWER AT THIS 
TIME OF YEAR THIS PLANT IS 
FLOWERING NATURALLY SO THIS WILL 
BE ON THE STAND AND WE WILL PLACE 
IT ON THE STAND IN A SLIGHTLY 
ANGLED SITUATION THE PLANTS WHEN 
THEY ARE GROWING FLAT LIKE THIS IN 
THE GARDEN WILL OFTEN COLLECT WATER 
IN THE ROSETTE SO WE PLANT IT ON A 
SLOPE TILTED THE RAIN DRAINS OUT 
THIS IS BE PLANTED ON THE STAND 
LIKE SO 
MOSTLY ALPINES COME FROM 
MOUNTAINOUS AREAS FROM AROUND THE 
WORLD TO GROW THERE THEY HAVE 
WELL DRAINED SOIL GOOD AIR 
MOVEMENT WIND WHICH THERE'S LOTS 
OF HERE IN LINCOLNSHIRE AND THEY 
LIKE A GOOD OPEN SKY ALL OF WHICH 
WE CAN PROVIDE HERE AT NETTLETON 
WE HAVE IN EXCESS OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND STOCK 
PLANTS GROWING IN POTS IN VARIOUS 
LOCATIONS AND WE SIMPLY PICK OUT 
THE BEST LOOKING ONES WE AIM TO 
PICK OUT AT LEAST SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY SO WE HAVE 
GOOD SELECTION WHEN WE GET TO 
MALVERN WE ALWAYS TRY ONE HUNDRED TEN PER CENT WE 
ALWAYS PUT EVERY EVIDENT IN TO MAKE 
THE DISPLAY AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE 
DURING THAT WEEK HONESTLY I THINK 
WE'LL GET A SILVER GILT 
OH NO 
I DO 
YOU DON'T DO DO I DO WE'LL BE CATCHING UP WITH 
POTTERTON'S LATER TO FIND OUT HOW 
THINK GOT ON IT WOULD BE REALLY 
UNUSUAL TOE WIN BEST IN SHOW TWO 
YEARS RUNNING BUTLY GIVE YOU MY 
THREE PREDICTIONS WHO I THINK MIGHT 
WIN THIS COVETED AWARD THIS YEAR 
MY FIRST PREDICTION FOR BEST IN 
SHOW IS FERN ATTICS STAND THE 
WHOLE STAND IS BUILT WITH THIS REAL 
EMPATHY THIS WONDERFUL LOVE FOR 
THESE PLANTS IT'S ABSOLUTE HEAVEN 
SECONDSLY THERE'SIVE RON BULB BEING 
THEIR STAND IS A VERITABLE SWEET 
SHOP PACKED WITH CONFECTIONS IT 
DISPLAYS ITS WARES WITH STYLE AND 
PANACHE PANACHE MY THIRD CHOICE IS THIS 
SCINTILLATING STAND THEY'VE 
GATHERED COLLECTION OF THE MOST 
WONDER ROUS WOODLAND PLANTS MANY 
OF THEM HARDLY EVER SEEN BEFORE IN 
THIS COUNTRY THEY'VE DISPLAYED 
THEM IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY JUST 
REALLY MAKE YOU WANT TO GROW THEM 
COMING UP LATER WE'LL FIND OUT IF 
CAROL'S PREDICTIONS WERE RIGHT AS 
WE CATCH UP WITH THE MEDAL WINNER 
IN THIS THE FLORAL MARQUEE 
REMEMBER JAMES AND MY FLORAL MASTER 
PIECES WHAT WILL THE FLORAL ART 
AFICIONADOS MAKE OF THEM AND 
RACHEL WILL FIND OUT WHO WILL WIN 
THE DESIGNER SCHOLARSHIP IN A 
DRAGONS' DEN STYLE PITCH 
FIRST ANOTHER COMPETITION TWENTY EIGHT 
SHOPKEEPERS ARE TURNING THEIR SHOP 
WINDOWS INTO WORKS OF FLORAL ART 
THEIR EFFORTS WILL COME UNDER THE 
SCRUTINY OF THE R. H. S. JUDGES 
IT'S REALLY BUZZING AT THE MOMENT 
IT'S NICE BECAUSE FOR EVERYBODY 
IT'S BEEN A TOTALLY NEW THING WE 
ARE ON A VERY STEEP LEARNING CURVE 
WE'VE ALL BEEN SUPPORTING EACH 
OTHER EVEN THINGS LIKE THE TOWN 
FLOORIST HAS BEEN WONDERFUL 
HELPING EVERYONE OUT GIVING HINTS 
AND TIPS 
IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT AS 
THE SPRING SHOW WAS COMING UP IT 
MIGHT BE A NICE IDEA TO DO 
SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE WAY SLOANE 
SQUARE DOES WHEN CHELSEA IS ON 
ORGANISATION DECORATE THE SHOT 
WINDOWS ONE OF THE SHOPS HAS GIVE 
AN PRIERBGSZ I THINK IT WAS A 
BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE AND THEN THEY 
CAME ONE A WEEK'S HOLIDAY IN MAD 
YEAR YA A PRIZE 
PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WOULD GO FOR 
THIS THIS THE FOOD I DO IS LOCAL SO I WANTED 
THE PLANTS 
TO BE LOCAL L. THOUGHT 
WHITE BE REALLY NICE IT ALONG 
THE LINES OF THE PETER RABBIT STORY 
WITH MRS. MCGREGOR SITTING IN THE 
GARDEN TRYING TO WARD OFF THE 
RABBITS I HAVE ROSE MARRY SAGES 
FENNEL MINTS SALADS ALL THE 
THINGS THAT ARE REALLY NICE TO EAT 
PRETTY LITTLE FLOWERS SOMETHING 
THAT GIVERS IT A COTTAGE GARDEN 
FEEL TO IT 
THE IDEA FOR THE DISPLAY WAS TO 
HAVE PICTURES FROM THE WINDOW 
LOOKING OUT OF THE POTTING SHED I 
WAS CONSCIOUS THAT WE HOME A SHORT 
WINDOW OUTSIDE SO I BROUGHT IT ON 
TO THE SILL AND TRIED TO BRING IT 
THROUGH THE GLASS TO GIVE AN 
IMPRESSION OF DEPTH SOME OF THE 
TOOLS HAVE BEEN CHOPPED OFF TO GIVE 
THE IMPRESSION OF FLOOR SPACE WE 
HAVE USED CHIPPINGS FROM PICTURE 
FRAMES INSTEAD OF SOIL 
I THOUGHT WHITE BE GOOD TO PRODUCE 
VAN GOGH'S STUDIO IN MY SHOP WINDOW 
QUITE AN UNDERTAKING AFTER TELLING 
EVERYBODY ELSE TO KEEP IT SIMPLE L. COULDN'T LISTEN TO MY OWN ADVICE 
WHEN WE WERE PUTTING IT TOGETHER 
WE WERE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR AND 
SAYING WHAT ARE YOU DOING AND 
OH WE WILL HAVE A LOOK AROUND WHEN 
IT IS DONE I THINK THEY WILL WE WE WILL FIND OUT WHICH SHOP WINDOW

MAY REMEMBER THAT EARLIER JAMES AND 
I ENTERED THE NOVICE CLASS IN THE 
FLORAL ART COMPETITION WITH OUR I 
DON'T KNOW UNIQUE EFFORTS LET'S 
FIND UNITED WHAT THE JUDGES THOUGHT 
OF THEM OUT WHAT THE JUDGES 
THOUGHT OF THEM 
WHEN WE CAME TO 
JUDGE WE HAD NO IDEA OF WHOSE 
KIBTS WE ARE JUDGING WE WERE 
EXHIBITS WERE JUDGING WITH EWERE 
FLAB GHASTED THEY HAD DONE SO WELL 
AND OUR CONGRATULATIONS TO THEM 
BOTH 
THEY HAVE A FUTURE A BIG BOTH FUTURE IN FLOWER ARRANGING MAYBE MAYBE IT WILL ENCOURAGE THE YOUNG MEN OF 
BRITAIN TO HAVE A GO AT FLOWER 
ARRANGING 
HOW DID WE DO LOOK AT ARRANGING THAT HIGHLY COMMENDED WHAT DID 
JAMES GET NOTHING AT ALL EAT MY 
OASIS JAMES 
WE SAW EARLIER HOW IMPORTANT THE 
GARDEN DESIGN MENTORING SCHOLARSHIP 
IS FOR THE ENTRANTS NOW THEY HAVE 
GOT TO PITCH IN FRONT OF THE JUDGES 
AND THE WHOLE AUDIENCE IT IS VERY 
NERVE RACKING 
I HAD THIS IDEA FOR 
TWO OR THREE YEARS 
WILL SUE HAVE 
THE SPARKLE TO IMPRESS THE PANEL I I CAN'T HELP MYSELF I THINK I'M A 
GARDENER BUT IT IS THE DESIGN THAT 
REALLY IMPASSIONS ME 
AS THE 
YOUNGEST DESIGNER HERE FIFTEEN YEAR OLD 
JACK IS DISPLAYING MATURITY BEYOND 
HIS YEARS AND HAS THE AUDIENCE 
EATING OUT OF HIS HAND 
HAVE YOU 
HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO THE 
JUDGES YES 
DID YOU AGREE WITH JUDGES YES ANYTHING THEY TOLD YOU OR WITH 
NOTHING 
WELL YES I RESPECT NOTHING THEM A LOT AND I BELIEVE THEY WERE 
RIGHT AND I WAS WRONG THEY WERE 
BIG I WAS SMALL 
NEXT TO FACE THE 
JUDGE IS ALEX BELL 
I BELIEVE THERE 
IS NOT ONE STAGE WHERE YOU KNOW 
EVERYTHING NO MATTER WHERE YOU IN 
HORTICULTURE THERE IS ALWAYS 
SOMETHING ELSE TO LEARN 
AS A NEW 
COMER MARK HAS A PARTICULARLY 
TOUGH TASK TO CONVINCE THE JUDGES 
HE SHOULD WIN 
I THINK A YEAR WITH 
CHRIS I WOULD LMS YOU KNOW I WOULD 
BE ABLE TO PRODUCE SOMETHING AT 
CHELSEA AND I WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE 
THE CRITICISM 
DESIGNER OF THE 
TWIST IN THE TALE GARDEN LINDSAY 
IS NEXT 
WHAT WAS THE HARDEST BIT OF

FRIDAY OF THE FIRST WEEK T. STONE 
WALLER WHO AGREED TO DO THE WORK 
DID NOT ARRIVE ON SITE IN THOSE 
CIRCUMSTANCE SITUATIONS YOU 
HAVE GOT TO CRACK ON AND KEEP A 
LEVEL HEAD AND GO THAT IS THE ISSUE 
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DEAL WITH IT 
IF YOU LOSE IT THERE IS YOU HAVE 
NO CHANCE 
LINDSAY SEEMED CONFIDENT 
AND MADE A BIG IMPRESSION

HAD FIVE STORIES AND THEY HAVE BEEN 
SEARCHING AND FEARLESS QUESTIONS 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THE JUDGES

RESULTS LATER ON 
I HAVE BEEN COMING TO MALVERN FOR 
WHAT MUST BE I DON'T KNOW SEVEN OR 
EIGHT YEARS BUT THE PROBLEM IS I 
RARELY GET OUT OF THE SHOW GROUND 
THIS YEAR I THOUGHT I WILL DO 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND SEE THE 
LOCAL COUNTRYSIDE AND SEE ONE OF 
THE LOCAL GARDENS L. HAVE COME 
ABOUT A MILE FROM THE SHOW TO A 
VILLAGE CALLED COLWALL TO MEET 
DAVID PUDSEY HE IS SLIGHTLY JUST 
SLOOGTLY ABSCESSED SLIGHTLY 
OBSESSED BY TREES 
OF COURSE YOUR GARDEN IS FULL OF 
PERENNIALS AND SHRUBS BUT THE 
TREES ARE YOUR MAIN PASSION YES YES WHY IS IT 
LEN I GO INTO A STRANGE 
GARDEN I FIND MYSELF NOT LOOKING 
DOWN FOR WEEDS BUT LOOKING UP AT 
THE MAGNIFICENT TREES 
I AGREE 
EVEN IN A SMALL GARDEN I PUT TREES 
IN THING THAT GO ON ABOVE EYE 
LEVEL IT MAKES YOU MOVE THROUGH 
THE GARDEN AND MAKES YOU LOOK 
THROUGH IT YES 
YOU HAVE THESE YES PATHS THERE IS SO MANY CHOICES AND 
HOW HAVE THEY SORT OF DEVELOPED 
HAVE YOU PLANT AND SOMETHING AND 
THEN MOWED A PATH AROUND IT NO NO WHAT LAPS INSTEAD OF STANDING AND 
STARING I WALK AROUND AS YOU WALK 
YOUR EYES ARE CAUGHT BY A GAP AND 
YOU LOOK AND SEE DOES THE GAP LEAD 
SOMEWHERE 
BUT THE THING I LOVE SOMEWHERE ABOUT IT IT DU NOT FEEL FORCED AT 
ALL IT IS NOT LIKE YOU HAVE TO GO 
DOWN THAT PATH THERE IS A LOT OF 
PATHS BUT THE CHOICES ARE YOURS TO 
MAKE 
YES IT DEPENDS WHAT MAKE INTERESTS YOU WITHIN THE VIEW YOUR YOUR EXTENDED VIEW IT IS TO DIE FOR IS 
THE THE HILLS BEYOND 
IT IS THE 
PERFECT BACKDROP BUT BEING ME I 
PREFER THE BACKDROP SEEN THROUGH 
TREES RATHER THAN JUST PLAIN WHAT WHAT IS THE PERFECT TREE HABIT FOR YOU 
UP RIGHT AND WEEPING 
SIMULTANEOUSLY I LIKE WEEPING IT 
HAS A CERTAIN ATMOSPHERE TREES 
THAT ARE UPRIGHT AND WEEPING ARE 
IDEAL 
THEY REALLY DO IT FOR YOU IDEAL THIS IS CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THE 
TREE THAT PEOPLE WALK UNDER AND 
NEVER LOOK AT WHEN YOU LOOK UP 
YOU SEE THESE PINK TASSELS AGAIN 
H. S. T. TASSELS AGAINST THE BLUE 
SKY 
IT IS A A MAPLE THIS IS A SKY LOVELY MAGNOLIA 
WOW IS A FUNNY 
CONCEPT IN A GARDEN YOU CAN'T SAY 
WOW ALL THE TIME 
THAT IS STUNNING 
THAT IS WHY I SAID WOW IT IS A 
STUNNING SPECIMEN AND THEY ARE SO 
FLEETING MAGNOLIAS L. WON'T SAY WOW 
AGAIN I PROMISE L. L. AM LOOKING UP 
HERE THIS IS YOU NEVER GET TO 
THE TRUNK OF THEM NORMALLY IT 
IS AN AMAZING PAPERY BARK 
YOU CAN 
CAN SEE THROUGH IT AND DOWN INTO 
THE UNDERPLANTING 
WE ARE FINALLY 
LOOKING DOWN AT THE GROUND YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
HERE YOU'VE GONE ALL FORMAL WE WE NEEDED SOMETHING PERMANENT FOR THE 
WINTER 
I LOVE THE SHAPE OF THESE WINTER YEWS WE HAVE CULL FULL CIRCLE L.

THANK YOU 
VISIT DAVID PUDSEY'S 
LOVELY GARDEN WILL BE OPENED ON MAY 
TWENTY FIFTH YOU CAN LOOK UP THE DETAIL IN 
THIS THE YELLOW BOOK HIS GARDEN IS 
PACKED WITH UNUSUAL PLANTS JUST 
LIKE THIS MARQUEE I'M OFF TO FIND 
A FEW 
COULD YOU POSSIBLY HAVE ANYTHING SO 
DELICIOUSLY LIGHT AND FLUFFY AND 
AIRY FAIRY AS THIS BEAUTIFUL PLANT 
IT'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE FIBRE OPTIC 
EXECUTIVE TOYS YOU JUST WANT TO 
PUT YOUR HAND INTO THE MIDDLE OF IT 
IT IS PURPORTEDLY HARDY BUT IT 
DOESN'T LIKE WINTER WET SO GROW 
INTO IT A POT AND GROW IT IN A 
BORDER YOU HAVE THE GUARANTEE OF 
GROWING IT FROM SEED 
HERE'S A PLANT THAT'S DEFINITELY 
NOT IN TOUCH WITH ITS FEMININE SIDE 
IT COMES FROM THE FOOTHILLS OF THE 
HIMALAYAS FIRST OF ALL COMES UP 
THIS ENORMOUS SPADE BUT AS THAT 
DIES DOWN IT SENDS UP A SINGLE LEAF 
STEM AN UMBRELLA OF LEAVES ON THE 
TOP WHERE IT COMES FROM IT CAN 
GROW UP TO SIX FEET TALL AND YOU CAN 
WALK UNDERNEATH IT IN THIS COUNTRY 
IF YOU ARE GOING TO PLANT IT PLANT 
IT REALLY DEEP BECAUSE IT HATES 
WINTER WET BUT IT NEEDS AMPLE 
MOISTURE DURING THE SUMMER IT 
MAKES SPWRAIT RUNNING ROOTS WITH 
TUBERS ON THE END SO YOU CAN 
EXPERIMENT FORM YOURSELF BY TAKING 
THEM OFF AND GROWING MORE

WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT 
EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW HOW TO 
KEEP SLUGS AND SNAILS OFF OUR

HAVE BEEN TRIALLING FOR FOUR YEARS 
YOU NEED TO PUT TWO BULBS OF GARLIC 
INTO TWO PINTS POFR WATER CRUSH 
THE GARLIC FIRST STEAM IT OR BOIL 
IT FOR ABOUT THREE TO FOUR MINUTES 
UNTIL IT ABSOLUTELY REEKS OF GARLIC 
AND IT IS BLANCHED STRAIN THE 
MIXTURE MAKE IT BACK UP TO THE TWO 
PINTS LET IT COOL THEN USING ONE 
TABLESPOON OF THE MIXTURE IN ONE 
GALLON OF WATER USE IT TO SPRINKLE 
ON TO THE LEAVES DO IT IN THE LATE 
AFTERNOON SO THAT IT WILL DRY ON 
THEM LIKE BIT ER ALUM L. CAN 
GUARANTEE PERSONALLY THAT EIGHTY PER CENT LESS 
SLUG PELLETS ARE USED BY USING THIS 
GARLIC WASH 
THE HIRSZ OF THE HOUSE IS IMPORTANT 
AND THE HISTORY OF HOSTA IS 
IMPORTANT WE HOPE TO MARRY THE TWO 
TOGETHER AND THAT PEOPLE WILL ENJOY 
THE HOSTA WALK I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE 
THAT ONE OF OUR NURSERYMEN HAS 
DECIDED TO NAME HOSTA EVERY ME 
CALLED UNA DUNNIT BUT IT IS VERY 
TINY VERY CURVEY AND BEAUTIFUL

TO MAKE SURE IT IS ENTIRELY 
DIFFERENT FROM ITS MOTHER PLANTS

RATHER HAVE LIKED A BIG BLOUSEY
