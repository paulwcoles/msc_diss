ONE OF THE GREAT BACKDROPS TO ANY 
SPORTING VENUE IN THE COUNTRY BUT 
HOW MUCH LONGER WILL BATH ABBEY 
REMAIN PART OF THE RUGBY LANDSCAPE 
TALKS CONTINUE AT THE SNAIL'S PACE 
ABOUT THE LOCAL RUGBY CLUB'S 
DEVELOPMENT AND CONTINGENCY PLANS 
HAVE BEEN DRAWN UP TO MOVE OUT OF 
THE CITY ALL THE WHILE THAT IS 
GOING ON ON THE FIELD THERE IS THE 
SMALL MATTER OF TRYING TO WIN A 
PLACE IN THE GUINNESS PREMIERSHIP 
SEMI FINALS 
SO JUST TWO WEEKENDS TO GO IN THE 
REGULAR SEASON OF THE GUINNESS 
PREMIERSHIP AND WE ARE HERE AT THE 
REC FOR BATH AGAINST SARACENS BATH 
HAVE TO WIN TO GET INTO THE PLAY 
OFFS AND SARACENS HAVING LOST 
AGAINST MUNSTER IN THE HEINEKEN CUP 
LAST WEEK HAD JUST PRIDE AT STAKE 
AS FAR AS THE PREMIERSHIP IS 
CONCERNED THERE ARE FOUR PLACES UP 
FOR GRABS AND SIX TEAMS IN 
CONTENTION GLOUCESTER HAVE BEEN AT 
THE TOP FOR MOST OF THE SEASON 
WITH GAMES AGAINST WASPS AND BATH 
TO COME IT WILL NOT BE EASY FOR 
THEM BUT ANYTHING LESS THAN A HOME 
SEMI FINAL WILL BE A DISAPPOINTMENT 
BATH HAVE HAD A FANTASTIC MUNCH 
MONTH IF THEY BEAT SARACENS TODAY 
THEY WILL GO TOP FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEN 
IT IS DOWN TO THE LAST GAME OF THE 
SEASON AWAY AT GLOUCESTER AFTER A 
SHOCKING START WASPS REALLY ARE 
THE FORM TEAM THEY HAVE WON EIGHT 
ON THE BOUNCE TO HAUL THEMSELVES 
INTO THE PLAY OFFS WOULD YOU BET 
AGAINST LAWRENCE DALLAGLIO LEADING 
HIMSELF HIS SIDE OUT AT 
TWICKENHAM HARLEQUINS HAVE BEEN A 
REAL SURPRISE PACKAGE A PLAY OFF 
PLACE WOULD BE A REAL ACHIEVEMENT 
FOR THEM IN THEIR SECOND SEASON 
BACK IN THE PREMIERSHIP HARLEQUINS 
ARE PLAYING SALE THIS AFTERNOON 
DEFEAT WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY 
ELIMINATE THEM FROM FINISHING IN 
THE TOP FOUR AND THEN THERE IS 
DEFENDING CHAMPIONS LEICESTER THEY 
ARE IN UNFAMILIAR TERRITORY BACK 
IN SIXTH THEY NEED OTHER RESULTS TO 
GO THEIR WAY AT NOTHING LESS THAN 
TWO BONUS POINT VICTORIES WILL BE 
ENOUGH 
TOBY FLOOD AND MATHEW TAIT OF BOTH 
LEADING NEWCASTLE AS KICK OFF GETS 
NEARER TIME FOR A WORD WITH BRIAN 
MOORE OUR REGULAR EXPERT IT IS A 
GREAT FINALE ISN'T IT 
IT IS 
BASIC THE FOOTBALL HAS BEEN 
EXCITING BUT THIS IS EVEN BETTER 
THEY SAY THE FOOTBALL L. THINK THE 
FOUR WHO ARE TOP AT THE MOMENT WILL 
BE THE FOUR GO INTO THE PLAY OFFS 
IS THIS A POTENTIAL BANANA SKIN FOR 
BATH 
IT COULD BE BUT I WOULD BATH DOUBT IT L. THINK BATH ARE IN THE 
MOOD AND THE WRECK IS A DIFFICULT 
PLACE TO PLAY IF THEY APPROACH IT 
IN THEIR USUAL WAY THEY WILL BE 
HOME 
THE THING ABOUT THE FANS IF HOME THEY ARE EXPECTING NOT JUST TO GET 
INTO THE LAST FOUR BUT THEY ALSO 
WANT THEIR SIDE TO WIN THE EUROPEAN 
CHALLENGE CUP AS WELL 
I THINK THEY CAN WIN THE CUP THEY 
CAN GO TO GLOUCESTER AND BEAT 
WORCESTER 
IT WILL BE A STRUGGLE IN WORCESTER THE PREMIERSHIP WE ARE MORE 
OPTIMISTIC IN THE EUROPEAN 
CHALLENGE CUP 
THIS YEAR WE CAN DO 
WHAT IT TAKES TO GET TO THE FINALS 
OF BOTH AND I THINK WE CAN WIN IF IF THEY PLAY LIKE THEY DID LAST WEEK 
AND CONTINUE IN THE SAME WAY THEY 
CAN DO THAT L. THINK THEY CAN TO 
TWO ATROPHIES 
IF WE CONTINUE HOW 
WE ARE PLAYING NOW WE HAVE A LOT 
OF PLAYERS WHO ARE INJURED TWO 
TROPHIES WE COULD GET THE DOUBLE 
FOR THESE SARACENS PLAYERS WARMING 
UP BEHIND ME TODAY IS LARGELY 
ABOUT PRIDE FOR THE BATH TEAM IT 
IS ABOUT WINNING THE TEAM GAME 
BUT ALSO PUTTING THEMSELVES IN THE 
SHOP WINDOW FOR THE ENGLAND SUMMER 
TOUR OF NEW ZEALAND OLLY BARKLEY 
IS HEADING OUT OF BATH FOR 
GLOUCESTER WILL HE BE HEADING 
TOWARDS THE ALL BLACKS STEVE 
BORTHWICK IS ALSO ON HIS WAY OUT 
ABOUT FOUR TODAY'S OPPONENTS 
SARACENS IS HIS INTERNATIONAL 
CAREER STILL ALIVE HIS MATT 
STEVENS TO BE THE ROCK AROUND TWO 
ENGLAND BUILD THEIR SIDE RICHARD 
HILL WILL PLAY HIS LAST GAME OF 
RUGBY NEXT WEEKEND AT VICARAGE ROAD 
AGAINST BRISTOL SARRIES HAVE WON 
JUST ONCE AT BATH IN THEIR LAST SIX 
VISITS VISITS ALAN GAFFNEY I SUSPECT THIS IS A 
GAME THAT TESTS YOUR SKILLS 
ABSOLUTELY WE HAVE HAD A LIGHT 
WEEK TRAINING FORTY FIVE MINUTES THERE 
WAS NO POINT FLOGGING THEM THEY 
GAVE THEIR ALL LAST WEEK L. 
COULDN'T ASK FOR MORE IT IS 
DIFFICULT THERE IS NO DOUBT WE 
WILL TRY TO BRING A FEW FRESH LEGS 
IN A BIT OF ENTHUSIASM WE HAVE TO 
PLAY FOR PRIDE WE LET OURSELVES 
DOWN AGAINST WASPS AND GLOUCESTER 
SO WE CAN'T ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN 
WE ARE PROUD A PROUD TEAM 
YOU ARE 
PLAYING AS A TEAM THAT WOULD RATHER 
NOT BE HERE BECAUSE THEIR SEASON 
IS OVER PLAYING AGAINST A TEAM 
DOES THAT MAKE IT EASIER 
THERE IS 
A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY IF YOU LOOK 
AT THE TWENTY TWO THAT SARACENS HAVE CALLED 
UP THERE ARE A LOT OF YOUNG LEGS 
OUT THERE THREE OF THE TWENTY TWO ARE 
OPENSIDE FLANKERS L. WOULD EXPECT 
THEM TO GO OUT AND PUT A REAL 
CHALLENGE IN PLACE AND TRY AND RUN 
US AROUND THE PARK IF WE ARE NOT 
ABSOLUTELY CONCENTRATING IN DEFENCE 
AND THEN WHEN WE CARRY THE BALL IN 
HAND PUTTING THEM UNDER PRESSURE 
AND SEEING HOW MOTIVATED THEY ARE 
WE COULD COME UNSTUCK 
HOW DO YOU SEE THIS ONE GOING I I WATCHED THEM BOTH WARMING UP AND I 
THOUGHT BATH LOOKED MORE FOCUSED 
SARACENS LOOKED TO BE ALMOST GOING 
THROUGH THE NUMBERS L. EXPECT THEM 
TO WIN COMFORTABLY 
THE COMMENTATOR 
IS ANDREW COTTER HE IS RIGHT OVER 
THERE A GREAT GROUND A GRAND CLUB BUT 
IT HAS BEEN A WHILE SINCE IT WAS 
GRACED BY SILVERWARE A DECADE HAS 
PASSED WITHOUT A TROPHY TONIGHT IS 
A CHANCE FOR BATH TO GO TOP OF THE 
PREMIERSHIP AND ALMOST GUARANTEE A 
PLACE IN THE PLAY OFFS STEVE 
MEEHAN IS PICKING FROM A HALE AND 
HEARTY SQUAD JUST TWO CHANGES FROM 
THE SIDE THAT BEAT SALE SARACENS BY CONTRAST ARE WEAKENED 
AFTER INJURIES TO KEY PLAYERS IN 
THEIR HEINEKEN CUP SEMI FINAL 
DEFEAT AGAINST MUNSTER AND A LATE 
INJURY IN THE WARM UP TO FULL BACK 
RICHARD HAUGHTON HIS PLACE GOES TO 
DAN SCARBROUGH TO SARACENS HAVE 
THE MANPOWER OR THE MOTIVATION TO 
UPSET BATH VERY MILD TODAY BUT 
BLUSTERY DOWN BY THE RIVER WHAT A TRY FROM BATH CUTTING 
SARACENS TO SHREDS 
THAT WAS ALL 
FOR TACKLING FROM SARRIES THEY 
JUST DIDN'T LOOK INTERESTED IT IS 
TOUCH RUGBY HAVE SOME PRIDE THIS THIS COULD BE A LANDSLIDE 
THIS COULD BE 
FIFTY POINTS SARACENS LIVING RIGHT ON THE EDGE WITH THEIR DEFENCE OLLY BARKLEY THE SARACENS DEFENCE WILTED DISAPPEARED 
MIGHT BE POINTS IN DISAPPEARED THE FIRST HALF BANAHAN IS THE PREMIERSHIP'S LEADING TRY SCORER SARACENS REALLY ARE REELING ANOTHER TRY LIPMAN UNDER THE POSTS 
IT IS A ROUT IN THE FIRST HALF 
THAT IS WHY THE REASONS ONE OF 
THE REASONS I LIKE LEE MEARS BATH LOOK QUITE COMFORTABLE IN DEFENCE AT THE MOMENT MADDOCK GET THE TRY OH ANOTHER 
ONE ANOTHER TRY THIS TIME OF THAT 
LENGTHY SARACENS ATTACKED IT ALL 
ENDS IN THE SAME THING A BATH 
TRIBE A BONUS POINT A BATH TRY SCRAPING IN OFF THE POST THEY CANNOT FAIL TODAY BATH EVERY LITTLE FAINT AND FLING OF THE BALL IS FINDING HANDS WHEN THAT CONFIDENCE COMES TO A SIDE THINGS COME OFF GLORIOUS STUFF FROM BATH NOBODY THERE FOR SARACENS BUT FOR 
BATH BUTCH JAMES INCREDIBLE THIS THIS COULD BE VERY EMBARRASSING DO SARACENS HAVE ANYTHING BANAHAN SKIPPED PAST THE FINAL 
TACKLE OH THIS IS SOMETHING THE 
LIKES OF WHICH AT THE RECREATION 
GROUND HAS NOT SEEN FOR LONG LONG TIME IF AT ALL I'M SORRY I'M NOT SAYING I TOLD YOU SO REPLACEMENT SCRUM HALF FOR SARACENS ALAN DICKENS WE ARE BEYOND FORTY MINUTES IT HAS TAKEN THEM THIS LONG TO GET THIS CLOSE TO THE BATH LINE SARACENS ARE SO CLOSE AND A CARD IS COMING YOU ARE OUT 
OF THE GAME YOU KILLED IT OFF YOU 
GO 
DESPITE ALL THEIR TRIES BATH GO HAVE LOST ONE OF THEIR MEN MICHAEL 
CLAASSENS THE SOUTH AFRICAN SCRUM 
HALF BATH DOWN TO FOURTEEN MEN SMALL 
CONSOLATION FOR SARACENS A HIGH TACKLE BUT SHOULDER SAYS THE REFEREE WELL BEYOND THE FORTY MINUTES AND 
STILL SARACENS COME WELL BEYOND FORTY 
POINTS BEHIND AND THAT WITH A 
KNOCK ON WILL BE THE END OF THIS 
FIRST HALF WHICH HAS BEEN SIMPLY 
REMARKABLE BATH DOMINANT SARACENS 
UNRAVELLING BEFORE OUR EYES AND 
BATH HEADING FOR COMPREHENSIVE 
VICTORY AT THE TOP OF THE TABLE 
BATH ARE GETTING A STANDING OVATION 
THEY PLAYED WELL BUT WHAT HAVE 
THEY BEEN PLAYING AGAINST 
VIRTUALLY NOTHING ACTUALLY LET'S 
NOT TAKE TOO MUCH AWAY BATH HAVE 
DONE THE HARD WORK AND RUN SOME 
GOOD LINES TO STOP FRANKLY THE 
SARACENS EFFORT HAS BEEN PITIFUL I I TELL YOU ONE THING WE ARE DOWN THE 
WRONG END FOR THE SECOND HALF YES YES WE ARE BATH HAVE TAKEN A LITTLE BIT OF 
TIME TO WARM UP IN THE SECOND HALF 
SIX MINUTES GONE AND THEY HAVE NOT 
SCORED 
THE POINT SARACENS TRYING TO PINCH THAT BALL P. O. W. ALL HAVE A TRY FOR SARACENS OH THE RECREATION GROUND 
IS SILENT IT IS NO MORE THAN CONSOLATION OR 
PRIDE BUT IT IS SOMETHING ADAM 
POWELL SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE I I TOLD YOU WE WERE DOWN THE RIGHT END 
FOR THE SECOND HALF IT IS A SARACENS LINE OUT CLAIMED BY CHESNEY BATH ARE BACK TO A FULL COMPLEMENT 
OF PLAYERS NOW MICHAEL CLAASSENS 
THE SCRUM HALF IS BACK WITH US 
AFTER HIS SPELL IN THE SIN BIN PENALTY COMING TO SARACENS YATES'S KNOCK ON IT MATTERS NOT IF 
KNOCK ON MATTERS NOT BUTCH JAMES 
IS GETTING CAUGHT FOR FOR A CHAT I I SPOKE TO NUMBER THREE NO HARM IN 
THE TACKLE NO ARMS TO HIDE TOO 
HIGH 
A QUICK YELLOW CARD FOR BUTCH HIGH JAMES AND ONCE AGAIN NO SOONER 
WERE THEY BACK TO FIFTEEN MEN THAN BATH 
ARE REDUCED AGAIN BUTCH JAMES IS 
OFF THAT IS SHOULDER CHARGE YATES ROLLING TO THE LINE AND DOWN THE VIDEO REFEREE WILL DECIDE IF 
SARACENS HAVE THEIR SECOND TRY 
JEFF IS IT A TRY PLEASE YES OR 
NO 
IT IS THE VIDEO REFEREE'S NO DECISION 
I CAN DO IT NOW O. K. IT DECISION IS A TRY 
TRY GIVEN TO KEVIN YATES 
TO SARACENS THEIR SECOND IT IS A 
LONG LONG ROAD BACK YET BUT YOU 
NEVER KNOW 
WHAT PRICE FORTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE ANY ANY PRICE YOU WANT BUTCH JAMES IS IN THE SIN BIN FOR 
BATH MICHAEL CLAASSENS HAS DONE 
HIS TIME AND NOW HE IS BACK PIETER DIXON THE REPLACEMENT 
HOOKER IS DOING JUST WHAT LEE 
MEARS WAS DOING IN THE FIRST HALF FEAUNATI ANNOUNCED HIS RETIREMENT 
THIS WEEK HOW HE WOULD LOVE A TRY 
BUT IT IS NOT HIS TURN IT IS 
LIPMAN WHO SCORES IF I COULD JUST DRAG YOU BACK FROM 
THE PAPER OLLY BARKLEY WAS PLAYING 
WITH A HUGE SPRING IN HIS STEP 
MAYBE HE HAS A POINT TO PROVE I I THINK HE IS DOING WELL TODAY L. THINK IT IS A GOOD PLAYER IN THE TOP TWO CENTRES IN THE COUNTRY BARKLEY IS THROUGH ONCE MORE ONCE 
MORE OLLY BARKLEY CUTS THROUGH THE 
SARACENS DEFENCE AND BATH HAVE 
THEIR EIGHTH TRY IT IS THEIR DAY AND 
BARKLEY'S DAYS DAY SARACENS HAD A PENALTY THEY TAKE 
IT QUICKLY BUT ALMOST AS 
INEVITABLY IT GOES WRONG KAMELI 
RATUVOU SARACENS HAVE THIRD TRY 
THREE TRIES AT THE RECREATION 
GROUND I'M SURE THEY WOULD HAVE 
TAKEN THAT BEFORE THE GAME IT 
MEANS SO DID WELL BUT IT DOES MEAN 
SOMETHING MEANS SO LITTLE IT IS 
NUMBER THREE 
FOR THE VISITORS JUST ICING TO BE PUT ON THE CAKE FOR BATH THEY HAVE SO IF THEY 
HAD BEEN SO IMPRESSIVE TODAY BUT 
THEY HAVE BEEN SO IMPRESSIVE TODAY 
AS IMPRESSIVE AS BATH HAVE BEEN 
SARACENS HAVE BEEN WOE FOR WILL 
FALL BATH WANT TO PASS THE SIXTY 
MARK THERE IS TRYING NUMBER NINE PASSED 
SIXTY TWO AGO THE DEMOLITION IS SURELY 
COMPLETE A MERCIFUL END A WELCOME BLAST ON 
THE WHISTLE FOR SARACENS BUT WHAT 
A PERFORMANCE FROM BATH A ROAR 
FROM THE RECREATION GROUND THAT 
WILL BE HEARD BY ALL THE 
PREMIERSHIP CONTENDERS THEY ARE 
TOP OF THE TABLE AND PERHAPS 
GREATER REWARD IS TO COME NINE 
TRIES 
AS I SAID A DRAWN SECOND HALF 
UTTERLY PREDICTABLE IT WAS A MUCH 
MORE ENJOYABLE SECOND HALF BECAUSE 
THERE WERE TWO TEAMS WHO WERE 
TRYING IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO 
SEE WHAT WAS SAID AT HALF TIME BY 
SARACENS BUT IT WORKS BATH WERE 
ALWAYS ON TOP L. GOT THE FEELING 
THAT IF THEY EVER NEEDED TO THEY 
COULD HAVE EXTENDED THEIR RANGE IT 
WAS A GOOD WIN 
AND THEY ARE GOOD 
TEAM TO WATCH 
YES THEY ARE A 
GOOD TEA ROOM 
IF THAT TURNS OUT TO BE THE LAST 
TIME YOU PLAY HERE WHAT WOULD YOU 
TAKE AWAY 
HAPPY MEMORIES IT HAS 
BEEN FANTASTIC A GREAT GROUP OF 
PLAYERS SUPERB PERFORMANCE THERE 
HOPEFULLY IT IS NOT OUR LAST GAME 
HERE WE GO TO GLOUCESTER NEXT WEEK 
AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL GET A RESULT 
WE HOPE THINGS WILL WORK OUT AND 
MAKE IT A HOME SEMI FINAL 
HOW DO 
YOU ASSESS THE TOP OF THE TABLE IT IT IS INCREDIBLY TIGHT IT IS A 
FANTASTIC ADVERTISEMENT FOR ENGLISH 
RUGBY THE STANDARD OF IT RIGHT NOW 
AND THE WAY TEAMS ARE GOING ABOUT 
THE WAY THEY ARE TRYING TO PLAY 
RUGBY 
HARD 
TO KNOW THE QUESTIONS RUGBY TO ASK AND HARD FOR YOU TO KNOW 
WHAT TO SAY IS IT 
STRANGELY I 
HAD A SMILE ON MY FACE L. HAVEN'T 
FOR THE LAST TWO HOURS IT IS ONE 
OF THOSE PERFORMANCES THAT I CAN'T 
EXPLAIN THERE HAVE BEEN THREE OF 
THEM IN RECENT TIMES BETWEEN THE 
QUARTER FINAL AND SEMI FINAL OF THE 
HEINEKEN CUP WASPS AND BATH 
TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE WE HAVE 
PRIDED OURSELVES ON OUR DEFENCE FOR 
A LONG TIME TO CONCEDE THOSE MANY 
TRIES IT IS HARD 
HOW DID YOU 
ASSESS THE FIRST FORTY MINUTES 
IT WAS 
A PRETTY COMPLETE FORTY MINUTES WE 
ARE VERY HAPPY WITH IT THE FEW 
TIMES WE HAD TO DEFEND ALIGN WE 
DID QUITE WELL HOUR LINE WE 
TOOK A MAJORITY OF OUR CHANCES AND 
PLAYED SOME GOOD RUGBY 
IN THIS 
SENSE MISSION ACCOMPLISHED IT 
MUST HAVE BEEN EVERYTHING YOU HOPED 
ANY INJURIES 
THE ONLY CONCERN IS 
DAVID BARNES EVERYBODY ELSE IS 
YOUR USUAL BUMPS AND BRUISES WE 
HAVE COME THROUGH PRETTY WELL 
ALTHOUGH SARACENS DECIDED NOT TO 
TURN UP IN THIS MATCH THEY WERE 
UNDONE BY A COMPLETE PERFORMANCE BY 
OLLY BARKLEY WHO DID SIMPLE THINGS 
LIKE THIS BUT ALSO SHOWED HE COULD 
DEAL LONGER VERSIONS BECKETT HERE 
BOUNCING OFF THE POST KICK 
HERE THERE ARE TWO FORWARDS IN 
FRONT OF HIM HE TAKES THE GAP 
THAT IS HIS FIRST TRY THE SECOND 
ONE LOVELY LINE CUTTING BACK 
STRAIGHT AND AT PACE A COMPLETE 
PERFORMANCE HIS HAND IS UP FOR THE 
TOUR TO NEW ZEALAND MAN OF THE 
MATCH FOR ME 
HARLEQUINS AGAINST SALE IS THE BIG 
MATCH TODAY AS FAR AS QUALIFYING 
FOR THE SEMIS IS CONCERNED NEXT 
WEEKEND 
EIGHTY SEVEN POINTS CLEARLY AGAIN TO BAR FOR 
SARACENS THEY HAVE WON MORE NEXT 
WEEK THEY COULD DO WITHOUT A 
GAME TOO FAR HOW DO YOU ASSESS THE 
BALANCE OF THE BATH SIDE 
IT IS A 
GOOD BALANCE WHEN THE FORWARDS TO 
THEIR GOOD RUNNING GREWCOCK LEE 
MEARS SOMETIMES THE BACKS LOOK 
FOR A BIT TOO MUCH CONTACT BUT OLLY 
BARKLEY IS AN INSPIRATION THERE IS 
NO DOUBT THEY HAD A CHANCE OF 
TAKING THE WHOLE LOT IF THEY PLAY 
AS WELL AS THEY DID TODAY ALBEIT 
THEY DIDN'T FACE THAT MUCH 
WE ARE 
HEADING IN ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES OR SO 
UP THE A FOUR FOR THE FINAL DAY OF 
BADMINTON ONE MORE WEEK TO GO IN 
THE REGULAR SEASON OF THE 
PREMIERSHIP THERE IS REALLY STILL 
EVERYTHING TO PLAY FOR
