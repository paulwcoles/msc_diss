HEAD TEACHER CHRIS SMITH HAS BEEN AT WELFORD FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS 
THEY ARE SO SMART HAVE YOU ALL HAD A NICE SUMMER HOLIDAY

YOU'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE WORLD YOUR CLASS IN THE SUMMER HOLIDAYS 
FIRST DAY'S ALWAYS GETTING THINGS GOING BUT IT'S GREAT TO SEE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES

HOW HAVE WE COME IN 
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT YEAR BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT INFANTS ANY MORE ARE WE 
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE WORK REALLY HARD THIS YEAR WILL YOU DO THAT FOR ME 
YEAH WHO'S HAD A NICE SUMMER HOLIDAY 
WELFORD PRIMARY IS IN THE HANDSWORTH AREA OF BIRMINGHAM 
WITH A LONG HISTORY OF IMMIGRATION IT'S NOW ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY 
I VIEW HANDSWORTH AS A MICROCOSM OF BRITISH SOCIETY 
LOOK HOW BRITISH SOCIETY HAS CHANGED IN TWO THOUSAND YEARS 
YOU'VE GOT INCOMING GROUPS THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF BRITAIN HAVEN'T YOU 
I MIGHT BE WHITE BRITISH BUT I MIGHT HAVE SOME NORMAN IN ME 
ITALIAN WHO KNOWS IF YOU GO BACK IN THE SMITH FAMILY TREE 
WE'RE GOING INTO ASSEMBLY NOW 
FOR YEARS THE SCHOOL HAS BEEN WORKING TO OVERCOME THE TENSIONS 
BETWEEN BRITAIN'S DIFFERENT ETHNIC COMMUNITIES 
RIGHT STRAIGHTEN UP EVERYONE IT'S THE JOB OF SCHOOLS TO BE CREATING UNDERSTANDING 
FOR THE COMMUNITY AND THE SOCIETY IN WHICH BRITISH CHILDREN GROW UP IN 
YOU HAVE THAT SPACE THERE 
COULD YOU JUST GO BACK A BIT PLEASE 
AS BRITAIN EXPERIENCES THE BIGGEST INFLUX OF PEOPLE FOR CENTURIES 
THIS IS THE STORY OF ONE TERM AT THE SCHOOL 
AND FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME THIS NEW SCHOOL YEAR 
GOOD MORNING CHILDREN GOOD MORNING MR. SMITH 
MY ASSEMBLY IS ABOUT ME LIKING BEING HEAD TEACHER OF WELFORD SCHOOL 
COS I DO LIKE BEING HEAD TEACHER OF WELFORD SCHOOL I LIKE WELFORD 
CAN ANYONE THINK OF THE THINGS THAT MAKE ME LIKE WELFORD 
WHEN PEOPLE ARE SENSIBLE WHEN PEOPLE DO REALLY GOOD WORK 
RAHEEM WHEN PEOPLE DON'T BULLY EACH OTHER 
TODAY WELFORD HAS PUPILS FROM SEVENTEEN DIFFERENT ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS 
IT'S NEVER HAD MANY WHITE BRITISH CHILDREN 
THERE'S NEVER MORE THAN TEN CHILDREN MAXIMUM WITHIN THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY OF FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY 
I ALREADY KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT YEAR FOR WELFORD 
IN OUR SCHOOL WE'RE FORTUNATE WE HAVE NO HUGELY PREDOMINATE GROUP 
WE ARE DIVERSE AND I THINK THAT HELPS FOR OUR COHESION 
MY FAMILY'S FROM PAKISTAN 
AND I AM FROM BIRMINGHAM ENGLAND 
MY DAD'S PART JAMAICAN 
I'M BRITISH SO I WAS BORN OVER HERE 
NATIONALITY I'M BRITISH BECAUSE I'M BORN IN BRITAIN 
MY MUM'S BORN IN BRITAIN AND MY DAD'S BORN IN BRITAIN 
MUM IS FROM SCOTLAND SO I THINK I'VE GOT SOME SCOTTISH IN ME AS WELL 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM 
I JUST LIKE BEING BRITISH BECAUSE IT'S GOT LOTS OF DIFFERENT 
IT'S NOT JUST LIKE ONE RACE IT'S GOT LOTS OF DIFFERENT RACES 
GOOD MORNING FIVE W. 
GOOD MORNING MR. WILLS 
RIGHT NATHANUAL NATHANUAL IS A QUARTER JAMAICAN AND THE THIRD IN HIS FAMILY TO GO TO WELFORD 
SCHOOL HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN EASY BUT HE'S HAPPY TO BE IN MR. WILLS' CLASS THIS YEAR 
MORNING GHAZALA 
MORNING NATHANUAL MORNING VIKRAM 
BEST THING ABOUT MR. WILLS IS HE'S FUNNY HE'S FUNNY 
MATHS IS ALL RIGHT 
BUT NOT VERY GOOD 
MORNING KHURUM MORNING NORRIS 
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT NORRIS 
GIVEN THAT WE ANSWER THE REGISTER IN TEN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES 
HOW MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES DO YOU THINK ALL OF US TOGETHER SPEAK IN THIS CLASS VIKRAM 
PUNJABI PUNJABI 
RIGHT O. K. PUNJABI 
IT'S GOOD ACTUALLY BEING FRIENDS WITH PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT PLACES' 
JUST COS THEY'RE FROM A DIFFERENT COUNTY 
AND YOU THINK THEY'RE NASTY THEY'RE NOT THEY COULD NOT BE THEY COULD BE NICE 
GERMAN POLISH 
IT'S TRUE THAT IN OUR SCHOOL SOME PEOPLE SPEAK POLISH ISN'T IT 
BUT NOT IN THIS CLASS 
ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE CHILDREN AT WELFORD WERE BORN IN BRITAIN 
SEVENTY PER CENT OF THEM SPEAK ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE 
THERE'S ANOTHER PAKISTAN LANGUAGE 
HINKO H. I N. K. O. 
ANDREW WILLS WAS BROUGHT UP IN HANDSWORTH AND HAS BEEN TEACHING AT WELFORD FOR EIGHT YEARS 
MY MUM WAS THE LOCAL CHURCH MINISTER FOR FIFTEEN YEARS HANDSWORTH'S MY COMMUNITY 
I FEEL I BELONG HERE AND THE PEOPLE I GREW UP WITH AREN'T SO DIFFERENT FROM THEM 
NORRIS AMERICAN WHAT AMERICAN CAN YOU SPEAK THEN NORRIS 
YO DOG DON'T MESS WITH MA SISTER 
DUTCH YOU'RE RIGHT YOU DO SPEAK DUTCH 
GOOD GIRL 
DID YOU GO TO HOLLAND BEFORE YOU CAME HERE OR DID YOU COME STRAIGHT FROM SOMALIA 
ASK HIM FOR ME 
NO HE CAME STRAIGHT HERE 
WELFORD GETS EXTRA MONEY TO HELP WITH NEW ARRIVALS AND BELIEVES THEY ARE NOT A DRAIN ON SCHOOL RESOURCES 
IT'S RARE THAT A CHILD ARRIVES WHERE THERE ISN'T A CHILD IN THE SCHOOL WHO SPEAKS THEIR LANGUAGE 
WHO IS ABLE TO DO TRANSLATION FOR US WHO IS ABLE TO HELP THEM INTEGRATE QUICKLY 
SO IF ONE OF YOU CAN TEACH A COUPLE OF WORDS TO ANOTHER GROUP MEMBER OR YOUR PARTNER 
AND ANOTHER SPEAKS BACK IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE 
MR. WILLS I KNOW HOW TO SAY NO IN SOMALIAN MAYA 
IS THAT RIGHT YEAH IT'S MAYA 
OH FANTASTIC I'VE LEARNED THAT 
MAYA 
ALYX IS ELEVEN YEARS OLD AND IN HER FINAL YEAR 
HER FAMILY HAVE BEEN PART OF WELFORD FOR GENERATIONS 
MY MUM'S BEEN TO WELFORD MY UNCLE'S BEEN TO WELFORD UM 
I'VE GOT MY NAN WHO'S THE CARETAKER AND THEN NOW MY GRANDAD 
WHO STARTED WORKING HERE AS THE ASSISTANT CARETAKER 
SHE'S ONE OF ONLY TWO WHITE BRITISH CHILDREN AT THE SCHOOL 
SHE'S GOT INDIAN TIME KEEPING AND THEY'RE ALWAYS LATE 
YOU'RE LATE AGAIN 
IT IS GOOD TO HAVE A MIX OF PEOPLE IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
WHETHER THERE'S MORE BLACK OR MORE WHITE PEOPLE IT'S JUST WHOEVER YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH REALLY 
MY CHILDREN CAME HERE AND I WOULDN'T HAVE ASKED ALYX TO COME HERE IF I THOUGHT THERE WAS A PROBLEM 
CHILDREN ARE CHILDREN DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SORT THEY ARE 
HANDSWORTH IS A COUPLE OF MILES NORTH OF THE CITY CENTRE 
IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST AREAS WHERE PEOPLE SETTLED IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES FROM THE WEST INDIES AND THE PUNJAB 
OVER THE YEARS HANDSWORTH HAS EXPERIENCED RACIAL TENSION 
WITH SERIOUS RIOTS IN THE EIGHTIES AND AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE 
TODAY THE AREA IS LARGELY MADE UP OF INDIAN AFRO CARIBBEAN AND PAKISTANI COMMUNITIES 
UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT TEN PER CENT 
HALF THE CHILDREN AT WELFORD GET FREE SCHOOL MEALS 
BEA'S BEEN THE COOK AT WELFORD FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS SHE GREW UP IN THE AREA 
YES I'M BORN AND BRED 
I MEAN HANDSWORTH'S NOTHING LIKE WHEN WE WERE LITTLE 
NOTHING AT ALL BELIEVE YOU ME 
WE COULDN'T EVEN PLAY WITH A BALL OUTSIDE 
THERE WAS LAWYERS SOLICITORS DOCTORS IT WAS SO POSH 
HANDSWORTH WAS MONEY THEN 
BUT THERE WASN'T THE SAME COMMUNITY FEELING YOU'VE GOT NOW 
YOU DIDN'T KNOCK ON ANYBODY'S DOOR AND ASKED FOR HELP YOU WOULDN'T HAVE GOT IT 
IT'S LUNCHTIME AND FOR MOST OF THE CHILDREN THEIR FAVOURITE TIME OF THE DAY 
WHAT'S UP 
I DON'T LIKE SCHOOL DINNERS 
YOU DON'T LIKE THEM YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING YOU CAN HAVE A FEW CHIPS AND SOMETHING ELSE CAN'T YOU 
BEA CATERS FOR ALL THE CHILDREN 
EVERYTHING FROM HALAL TO VEGETARIAN FOOD IS ON THE MENU 
ELEVEN YEAR OLD MARIAM IS ONE OF NEARLY TWO HUNDRED MUSLIM CHILDREN AT WELFORD 
TODAY IS HER LAST SCHOOL MEAL FOR A MONTH AS RAMADAN IS ABOUT TO BEGIN 
IT'S UP TO WHEN THE MOON COMES OUT COS TOMORROW'S THE TRIP AS WELL 
SO HOPEFULLY THE MOON DON'T SHOW TOMORROW 
I WISH THE MOON DON'T SHOW TOMORROW 
BECAUSE THEN I WON'T BE ABLE TO EAT ON THE TRIP AND THAT'S JUST WRONG 
BASICALLY YOU KNOW LIKE THERE IS A MONTH 
WHERE ALL MUSLIMS SHOULD FAST WHEN THEY'RE LIKE OVER TWELVE YEARS OLD BUT YOU HAVE A CHOICE TO DO IT BEFORE 
YOU KNOW THE POOR PEOPLE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO FEEL HOW THEY FEEL 
COS THEY DON'T EAT IN SOME COUNTRIES SO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO FEEL THAT WAY 
BASICALLY THAT IS WHAT RAMADAN IS ALL ABOUT 
IT'S A FEW DAYS INTO TERM AND NATHANUAL'S BACK IN THE SWING OF THINGS 
I'VE BEEN PLAYING WITH MY FRIENDS 
DOING HARD WORK AND I'M IN A NEW CLASS 
BUT DESPITE ENJOYING BEING BACK HE'S MISSING HIS BEST FRIEND 
I'M MISSING BAJDAR 
HE'S STILL GONE TO IRAQ 
ON HIS HOLIDAY MEETING HIS FAMILY AND HIS BROTHERS 
LET ME TAKE A SHOT 
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND OUT OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL AND I MISS HIM REALLY LOTS 
ALL SUMMER I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM 
IT'S A DANGEROUS PLACE IRAQ I WORRY ABOUT HIM 
I DREAM THAT HE MAYBE NOT COME BACK OR THAT HE MAYBE GOT HURT 
FOR OTHERS THERE ARE MORE PRESSING PROBLEMS 
YOU FOUR COME WITH ME 
DOWN TO MY ROOM 
SO YOU HAD THIS DISCUSSION IN CLASS BEFORE YOU WENT OUT TO PLAY 
YES YES 
SO WHY ARE WE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A FIGHT 
WE DIDN'T SAY IT BE QUIET 
I WILL ASK YOU WHEN I'M READY TO 
BECAUSE WHEN I WAS WAITING FOR YOU 
WHEN I WAS WAITING FOR THE CLASS TO GO FOR DINNER I WAS PLAYING FOOTBALL AND THEN 
I DON'T LIKE THIS I ESPECIALLY DON'T LIKE IT 
WHEN YOU'RE TAKING ABOUT FIGHTING WHEN YOU'RE IN CLASS WHEN YOU SHOULD BE WORKING 
DO I LIKE THAT NO NO I DON'T 
WHO STOPPED YOU FIGHTING THE DINNER LADIES THE DINNER LADIES 
DID YOU STOP WHEN YOU WERE TOLD TO 
YEAH THEN THEY CAME AND THEY WERE GOING LIKE THAT OH GREAT 
WHEN WE WERE SITTING DOWN 
COS THEY DIDN'T 
NONE OF YOU ARE HELPING EACH OTHER 
ALL FOUR OF YOU CAN CALM DOWN BEFORE I LET YOU GO BACK TO CLASS NOT GOOD 
ENFORCING DISCIPLINE IS A DAILY BALANCING ACT FOR MR. SMITH 
HE MUST BE EVEN HANDED SO AS NOT TO CAUSE DIVISION IN THE COMMUNITY 
WHEN I TALK TO PARENTS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PARTNERSHIP 
WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER EVEN IF WE HAVE DIFFICULT TIMES NOW AND THEN 
IS YOUR EYE O. K. 
LET ME SEE I DIDN'T PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE 
YOU NEED TO GET A COLD COMPRESS AND PUT THAT ON IT 
DESPITE THE FIGHTS AND COLD COMPRESSES MRS. MCKAY WHOSE JOB IT IS TO LIAISE WITH PARENTS 
SAYS THEY SUPPORT THE SCHOOL'S APPROACH 
YOU'VE GOT A GROUP OF CHILDREN WHO ARE LIVING TOGETHER IN A SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT EATING TOGETHER 
SPENDING A WHOLE DAY TOGETHER PLAYING TOGETHER REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER CULTURE THEY'RE FROM 
THEY'RE LEARNING THE TRUTH ABOUT EACH OTHER AND NOT JUST WHAT YOU SEE IN THE MEDIA 
I THINK THAT CAN ONLY BE GOOD AND THAT CAN ONLY PROMOTE HARMONY REALLY 
THE SCHOOL MUST ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT LIFE BEYOND THE SCHOOL GATES 
THINGS THAT HAPPEN AT HOME DO AFFECT CHILDREN'S PERFORMANCE IN SCHOOL 
THEREFORE IF WE ACTUALLY ARE AWARE OF WHAT IS GOING ON AT HOME 
THEN WE CAN ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE CHILD AND SUPPORT THE PARENTS 
SCHOOL'S OUT AND PARENTS AND CHILDREN HEAD HOME 
ELEVEN YEAR OLD XHOSA OFTEN STAYS BEHIND AT ONE OF THE SCHOOL'S CLUBS 
SEPARATE THEM 
THAT WAS FUNNY YESTERDAY I KNOW 
STRAIGHT AFTER SCHOOL I DO ART CLUB ON A MONDAY BADMINTON ON A TUESDAY KEYBOARDS ON A WEDNESDAY 
THURSDAYS I DO DANCE FRIDAYS I DO SWIMMING 
SATURDAY I HAVE DRAMA CLUB AND SUNDAY I HAVE DANCE 
MY DAD HE'S A STORYTELLER SO HE USUALLY STORY TELLS IN SCHOOLS OR AT MUSEUMS 
MY MUM SHE WORKS AS A YOUTH WORKER 
BUT NOW HE'S GOT HIS FIRST FRONT DOOR KEY 
I'LL BE WALKING FROM SCHOOL ON MY OWN SO I CAN OPEN THE DOOR 
INSTEAD OF GOING TO AFTER SCHOOL CARE 
MORNING 
MORNING 
I MEAN A NORMAL DAY YOU GET UP SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND THEN THAT'S BUSY UNTIL NINE O'CLOCK 
WHEN YOU'VE OPENED UP AND SEEN THAT EVERYBODY'S GOT WHAT THEY WANT 
NORA ALYX'S GRAN IS GOING ABOUT HER DAILY ROUTINE 
AT LEAST IT'S NICE AND PEACEFUL 
I WASN'T INTENDING TO COME TO THE SCHOOL 
THEN THERE WAS A CARETAKER HERE JUST FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS BEFORE I CAME 
AND THEY ASKED ME IF I WOULD MIND HELPING THEM OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE STUCK 
YOU'RE SORT OF CHECKING THE CLASSROOMS AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU'RE 
IT'S LIKE FIGHTING WITH THE TRIFFIDS 
IN THE LOFT SHE'S KEPT PHOTO ALBUMS FROM WHEN THE SCHOOL FIRST OPENED THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO 
NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THAT ONE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE THAT ONE 
I THINK YOU'D STILL SAY THERE WAS A MIX EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN SEE A DIFFERENCE 
TO THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN SCHOOL OR THE SURROUNDING AREA 
BUT BECAUSE IT HAPPENS IN SUCH A GRADUAL WAY YOU JUST ACCLIMATISE AS YOU GO ALONG 
IF YOU HAVE A LOOK ON SOME OF THESE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE MRS. MCKAY WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER 
IMMIGRATION MAY BE NOTHING NEW AT WELFORD BUT LIKE SO MANY OTHER SCHOOLS 
THEY'VE GOT NEW PUPILS ARRIVING ALL THE TIME 
IN A COMMUNITY LIKE THIS YOU CANNOT STAND STILL 
YOU'RE FOREVER HAVING TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT ISSUES BECAUSE YOU HAVE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE COMING IN 
WE HAVE HAD SOME EASTERN EUROPEAN PUPILS IN 
SO IT IS CHANGING SO THAT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW IT EVOLVES REALLY 
ANOTHER SCHOOL DAY IS UNDER WAY WITH ALL OF ITS FRUSTRATIONS 
FOR NATHANUAL THERE'S GOOD NEWS HE'S FOUND HIS BEST FRIEND BAJDAR 
IT WAS FUN MY MUM AND DAD 
THEY DONE A GOOD JOB BECAUSE I NEVER SEEN IRAQ FOR A LONG TIME AND IT WAS REALLY EXCITING 
I SAW MY GRANDMA GRANDAD 
THEY WERE SAYING WHO IS YOUR BEST FRIEND I WAS SAYING NATHANUAL 
WHY DID YOU LEAVE IRAQ 
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO EXPLORE THE COUNTRY 
BECAUSE THERE WAS LOADS OF BOMBS AND STUFF LIKE THAT 
AND I CAME HERE TO HAVE A GOOD LIFE WHERE I AM 
ARE YOU ENJOYING BIRMINGHAM YEAH I ENJOY BIRMINGHAM 
SO WERE YOU SCARED GOING BACK 
SCARED YEAH NOT QUITE HE WASN'T NOT QUITE NOT SCARED BUT 
IN THE AEROPLANE WHEN IT GOES LIKE IT GOES FAST AND IT GOES UP 
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN AN AEROPLANE BEFORE 
I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO GO ON ONE 
SOMEWHERE I KNOW MY FAMILY IS IN 
LIKE CAMBRIDGE AND YOU CAME BY CAR 
YOU HAVE TO COME BACK YEAH ON THE TRAIN 
IT'S TIME FOR THE TEAM CAPTAIN ELECTIONS 
MR. SMITH HAS SELECTED TWENTY THREE CHILDREN TO MAKE A SPEECH TO THE WHOLE SCHOOL 
SHUSH THANK YOU 
I AM EXCITED BUT IT WILL BE QUITE SCARY 
I WANT TO MAKE IT FUNNY SO I GET A VOTE 
BECAUSE I KNOW XHOSA'S GONNA GET LOADS OF VOTES THE WAY HE DONE IT 
HERE'S THE BALLOT BOX YOU VOTE FOR ONE PERSON 
DON'T VOTE FOR THAT PERSON BECAUSE YOU'RE A GIRL AND THAT PERSON'S A GIRL 
OR YOU'RE A BOY AND THAT PERSON'S A BOY 
OR IT'S YOUR COUSIN OR THEY LIVE ON THE SAME ROAD AS YOU 
THE KIDS MUST LEARN ABOUT CITIZENSHIP AND WHAT IT TAKES TO WIN OVER THEIR FRIENDS 
OUR NEXT CANDIDATE IS ALYX 
I'M ALYX AND I WANT TO BE ONE OF YOUR NEW TEAM CAPTAINS 
I WANT TO MAKE MY LAST YEAR THE BEST MEMORY OF ALL 
I'M A HARD WORKING ENERGETIC PERSON WHO ALWAYS MAKES TIME TO LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS 
I LOVE BEING PART OF THE WELFORD COMMUNITY AND HAVE BEEN PART OF IT FOR PRACTICALLY MY WHOLE LIFE 
OUR LAST CANDIDATE IS XHOSA 
HELLO WELFORD SCHOOL HELLO 
SCREAM IF YOU WANT A SWIMMING POOL 
WELL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SORT THAT OUT WITH MR. SMITH 
BUT THIS IS WHAT I CAN DO AND IT'S IN THIS RHYME 
THIS IS A POEM FROM MY HEART AND SOUL THIS IS A POEM THAT'S GONNA TAKE ITS TOLL 
IT'S A CHANCE FOR ME IT'S A POEM FOR YOU HOPEFULLY IT'S GONNA HELP YOU CHOOSE 
I CAN HELP THE LITTLE ONES IN THE PLAYGROUND I CAN HELP TURN THEIR FROWN UPSIDE DOWN 
THAT'S ENOUGH FROM ME NOW IT'S UP TO YOU 
VOTE YOU KNOW WHO PLEASE VOTE FOR ME YEAH 
CHILDREN I THINK ALL OF OUR TEAMS CAPTAINS DESERVE A LAST ROUND OF APPLAUSE 
RIGHT SORRY IT'S A BIT WARM IN HERE IF YOU'RE SUPER WARM TAKE OFF YOUR JUMPER FIZZ BUZZ 
FIZZ IS FOR 
ALTHOUGH MOST OF WELFORD'S CHILDREN SPEAK ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE 
MOST OF THEM ACHIEVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IN ENGLISH MATHS AND SCIENCE BY THE TIME THEY'RE ELEVEN 
BUT NATIONALLY THE PICTURE'S MORE MIXED 
ONE TWO THREE FIZZ 
I WOULD SAY NO CHILD SHOULD MISS OUT 
THERE ARE STATISTICS ABOUT PARTICULARLY WHITE BOYS NOT DOING AS WELL 
NINE TEN ELEVEN FIZZ BUZZ 
IT IS A LOT TO DO WITH ASPIRATION IT'S A LOT TO DO WITH PARENTAL SUPPORT 
AND IF THOSE THING DON'T EXIST WITHIN A FAMILY 
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT ETHNICITY YOU ARE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO AS WELL 
TOO MUCH PROTESTING TO THE REFEREE 
JUST A MINUTE YELLOW CARDS 
TAMMI I'LL PHONE YOU 
IT'S FRIDAY AND TIME FOR THE KIDS TO LEAVE WELFORD BEHIND FOR THE WEEKEND 
MANY OF THEM LIVE JUST A FEW MINUTES' WALK AWAY BUT MOST WON'T SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN UNTIL MONDAY 
YO YO 
MINI JAW BREAKERS 
ARE YOU BUYING THEM YEAH ARE YOU YEAH COME ON LET'S GO 
BAJDAR SEE YA SEE YA WOULDN'T WANNA BE YA 
IT'S SATURDAY MORNING AND XHOSA'S ENDURING HAVING HIS HAIR DONE BY MUM NESS 
COS XHOSA HATES HAVING HIS HAIR DONE IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD MOTHER AND SON BONDING MOMENT IS IT XHOS 
I WANTED TO HAVE DREADLOCKS BUT YOU WOULDN'T LET ME IS THAT RIGHT WHY WOULDN'T I LET YOU 
BECAUSE IT HAD TO BE TAKEN CARE OF TOO MUCH OH O. K. MAYBE 
CLIVE GREW DREADLOCKS BUT HE DIDN'T TREAT HIS AND HIS WERE MAD 
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS BUT WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER 
NOT MUCH LONGER ACTUALLY PROBABLY ABOUT TWENTY YEARS 
NESS IS MIXED RACE FROM SCOTTISH AND INDIAN PARENTAGE 
DAD CLIVE IS SECOND GENERATION JAMAICAN 
WE HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS WITH OTHER MIXED RACE CHILDREN AND I THINK THAT WAS REALLY HELPFUL 
THAT THAT WAS THE NORM FOR THE KIDS REALLY 
MY WIFE'S BROKEN THE COOKER SO WE'RE BACK TO THE CAVEMAN DAYS 
CLIVE IS A GOVERNOR AT WELFORD AND SEES THE STRENGTH IN HIS CHILDREN'S BACKGROUND 
MY BOYS' AWARENESS WILL BE MUCH MORE DIVERSE THAN MINE 
THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE A MAKE UP OF FOUR DIFFERENT IDENTITIES' 
I THINK THEIR LIVES WILL BE MUCH MORE RICHER 
AND DIVERSE THAN MINE WILL BE AND I'M HAPPY FOR THEM ON THAT ONE 
EVERY WEEKEND XHOSA PRACTISES WITH HIS DANCE GROUP 
TODAY HE'S OFF INTO TOWN FOR A PERFORMANCE 
ALYX IS WITH HER MUM RACHEL ON THE WAY TO HER DANCE CLASS 
SHE'S BEEN GOING SINCE WAS THREE 
WHAT DID YOU HAVE FOR DINNER TODAY UM SPAM FRITTERS 
IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO SEE HER DANCING 
I USED TO DO BALLET WHEN I WAS YOUNGER 
I GAVE IT UP WHEN I WAS ABOUT ELEVEN 
BUT UM IT WAS MUCH STRICTER THAN THE DANCE THAT ALYX DOES 
LATIN AMERICAN DANCING IS VERY ER POPULAR THESE DAYS SO IT'S SOMETHING SHE MAY TAKE UP AGAIN 
WHEN SHE'S OLDER EVEN IF SHE DOES LEAVE IT FOR A FEW YEARS 
O. K. CLASS ARE WE READY 
LET'S GO 
WHEN I'M GETTING UP ON A SATURDAY MORNING I THINK I SHOULD BE HAVING A LIE IN OR SOMETHING 
BUT NORMALLY I JUST LIKE COMING HERE 
DANCING GIVES ALYX THE CHANCE TO FOLLOW IN HER MUM'S FOOTSTEPS AND TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS 
I'M HERE FOR TWO HOURS 
YOU CAN MEET ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND MEET NEW PEOPLE 
AND WE ARE NOW JUDGING YOU 
IN THE CITY CENTRE XHOSA'S PERFORMANCE IS UNDERWAY AT BIRMINGHAM'S ARTSFEST 
DANCING IS PART OF ME BECAUSE IT RUNS IN MY BLOOD 
RUDI'S DONE IT WHO'S MY OLDER BROTHER HE SET THE TRADITION 
AND I'VE JUST FOLLOWED IN THE TRADITION BASICALLY 
ALL OF THE PEOPLE AT DANCE COS I MEET UP WITH THEM SO MUCH THEY FEEL LIKE FAMILY TO ME 
NESS HAS BEEN A YOUTH WORKER IN BIRMINGHAM FOR SIXTEEN YEARS 
AND ENCOURAGES HER BOYS TO MAKE THE MOST OF EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON IN THE CITY 
I THINK DOING STUFF TOGETHER IS QUITE IMPORTANT FOR US 
THERE'S THINGS LIKE CHINESE NEW YEAR DIWALI FESTIVAL YOU KNOW 
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF STUFF GOING ON SO IT'S GREAT 
WITH BIRMINGHAM LIKELY TO BECOME ONE OF THE FIRST CITIES WHERE THE WHITE POPULATION WILL BE IN A MINORITY 
NESS IS CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING THE BALANCE RIGHT 
I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS CELEBRATE BRITISH CULTURE 
WITHOUT PEOPLE FEELING THAT IT'S MAKING A RACIST STATEMENT 
I MEAN THERE'S THINGS LIKE SAINT GEORGE'S DAY IN BIRMINGHAM THEY'VE STARTED TO DO IT NOW 
BUT SAINT PATRICK'S DAY IS A MASSIVE CELEBRATION AND NOBODY FEELS IN ANY WAY EMBARRASSED OR GUILTY 
THE DIFFICULTY IS WITH THE ENGLISH CULTURE AT THE MOMENT WE'RE NOT AT THAT STAGE WHERE YOU CAN DO IT 
I'M GOING TO BAJDAR'S 
MY MUM SAID IT'S ALL RIGHT 
HIS MUM SAID IT'S ALL RIGHT 
IT'S MY VERY FIRST TIME BUT BAJDAR'S BEEN TO MINE ONCE AND A COUPLE OF TIMES 
I'M HERE 
NATHANUAL BAJDAR'S FAMILY HAVE BEEN IN BIRMINGHAM FOR FOUR YEARS

THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANT AROUND WHEN THE CHILDREN ARRIVE 
GOOD MORNING CHILDREN

I'M CONFIDENT YOU CAN ALL DO AN EXCELLENT JOB

HAS HE USED WORDS LIKE THE ONES HE USED TO YOU IRAQI PAKI 
YEAH THIS WEEK THIS WEEK 
BUT HE DIDN'T SAY IT ONCE HE SAID IT LOADS 
LOADS OF TIMES RIGHT AND WHAT ABOUT COMMENTS ABOUT YOUR FAMILY 
HAS HE SAID WORDS LIKE THAT BEFORE TO YOU 
ARE YOU SURE NATHANUAL 
O. K. 
DO YOU THINK HE WAS JUST BLAZING BOYS 
AND HITTING 
AND HITTING I DON'T LIKE BLAZES LIKE THAT 
BECAUSE IT'S OFFENSIVE ISN'T IT 
COS HE WAS MAKING RUDE COMMENTS ABOUT YOUR MUM YOUR DAD AND YOUR GRANDMA WASN'T HE 
MY NAN AND MY GRANDDAD 
AND HE WAS MAKING RUDE COMMENTS ABOUT YOU WASN'T HE YES MR. SMITH 
O. K. AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT IN THIS SCHOOL DO WE 
NO SIR ARE YOU TWO STILL FRIENDS 
YES ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT YEAH 
CERTAIN YEAH ALL RIGHT SHAKE HANDS BEST FRIENDS 
O. K. BOYS 
BACK TO CLASS YOU CAN DO P. E. NOW NATHANUAL 
IN OUR COMMUNITY BLAZING IS A WAY OF 
THE CHILDREN CALL IT BLAZING BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY BEING VERY RUDE 
SOMETIMES AGAINST COLOUR SOMETIMES AGAINST RELIGION SOMETIMES COUNTRY OF ORIGIN 
SADLY IT IS QUITE INGRAINED IN SOME OF OUR FAMILIES SOME OF OUR CHILDREN 
AND IT'S JUST A BLAZE WHERE IN FACT IT'S RACIS T. 
IT'S SEXIST IT'S DOWNRIGHT HORRIBLE AND NOT TO BE TOLERATED 
IT'S MORNING BREAK AND SNACK TIME 
IT'S ALSO THE MIDDLE OF RAMADAN AND MANY OF THE MUSLIM CHILDREN ARE FASTING 
MARIAM HASN'T EATEN SINCE DAWN 
YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOURSELF BUSY BASICALLY 
BUT SOME PEOPLE THEY GO INTO THE CANTEEN AND JUST SIT THERE AND STARVE THEMSELVES 
THEY JUST SIT THERE AND WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO FINISH 
I'VE MISSED TWO OUT SO FAR 
THAT'S GOOD FOR MY AGE THOUGH COS YOU HAVE TO START FASTING WHEN YOU'RE TWELVE 
IF YOU KEEP MOST OF YOUR FASTS YOU GET A REWARD AT THE END OF THE MONTH 
I'M NOT KEEPING MY FASTS BECAUSE OF THAT I'M JUST KEEPING IT BECAUSE I LIKE FASTING 
IT'S GOOD TO FAST YOU FEEL HOW OTHER PEOPLE WOULD FEEL 
IF THEY DON'T HAVE NO FOOD AND THEY FEEL LIKE IT EVERY DAY 
WE'VE HAD ABOUT 
THIRTY FORTY CHILDREN 
YOU KNOW NOT TAKING THE MEAL 
IT IMPACTS ON THE SNACKS MORE THAN THE MEALS I THINK 
THE SNACKS ALWAYS GO DOWN ON RAMADAN 
SO WHETHER THEY GO WITHOUT THE SNACKS AND THEN DECIDE THEY'RE HUNGRY AT DINNER TIME 
IN THE PLAYGROUND EMOTIONS ARE RUNNING HIGH 
NATHANUAL AND BAJDAR ARE IN A DISPUTE OVER THE GOAL POSTS 
THE BOYS TAKE SIDES 
YOU KNOW SO YOU KNOW SO 
MOVE MOVE MOVE YOUR BACKSIDE 
PRICK 
THE KIDS CONTINUE TO PLAY 
BUT MR. SMITH'S TAKEN A CALL FROM THE POLICE THERE'S BEEN A SHOOTING OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL 
YESTERDAY EVENING NEARLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS AGO THERE WAS A SHOOTING 
LITERALLY A HUNDRED METRES AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL GATE 
JUST ROUND THE CORNER FROM WELFORD ROAD 
SADLY OUR COMMUNITY IS POSSIBLY A LITTLE ALTHOUGH STILL SHOCKED 
A LITTLE IMMUNE TO EVENTS LIKE THAT HAPPENING 
BIRMINGHAM HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST GUN CRIME RATES IN THE COUNTRY MUCH OF IT LINKED TO GANG WARFARE 
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR WE AS A SCHOOL TO BE HONEST WITH THEM ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED 
THERE WILL BE A DRUG OR GANG ELEMENT INVOLVED 
YOU KNOW SO WE DO TALK ABOUT DRUGS WE DO TALK ABOUT GANGS 
I TRY REALLY NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT 
SEEING AS WE'RE LIVING HERE 
I ACCEPT THAT THIS IS WHAT HANDSWORTH IS LIKE 
AND THAT'S THE TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN HANDSWORTH 
IT MAKES YOU ANGRY SOMETIMES BECAUSE YOU THINK 
MOST PEOPLE ARE REALLY NICE ROUND HERE BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST LIKE 
YOU HAVE THE OCCASIONAL 
BAD PERSON WHO SPOILS IT FOR EVERYONE 
THEY HAVE GOT TO BE STRONG BECAUSE ONCE THEY GET TO ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SEVENTEEN 
IF THEY'RE NOT ENGAGED IN EDUCATION 
IF THEY'VE NOT GOT PURPOSEFUL ACTIVITY 
THE PRESSURE ON THEM THE PULL IN IS SO STRONG 
THEY'VE GOT TO BE STRONG AND THAT'S WHERE THE WHOLE COMMUNITY'S 
GOT TO BE STRONG IN SUPPORT OF THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE 
THE SHOOTING IS A REMINDER OF THE PRESSURES AND DANGERS THE CHILDREN CONSTANTLY FACE OUTSIDE SCHOOL 
TRIBALISM IS 
THE MOST DANGEROUS ASPECT OF OUR COMMUNITY 
IT CAUSES DIVISION WHERE THERE IS NO NEED FOR DIVISION 
IF PEOPLE GROUP THEMSELVES IN TRIBES FOR WHATEVER REASON THEN SOCIETY 
IS NOT GOING TO BE AS TOLERANT OF EACH OTHER IS NOT GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL 
AS THE TERM HEADS TO A CLOSE THE SCHOOL HAS A GOLD STAR ASSEMBLY 
PROUD PARENTS COME TO CELEBRATE THEIR CHILDREN'S SUCCESS 
GIVE MISS FELTRUP A ROUND OF APPLAUSE 
SO HERE WE ARE WITH OUR NEW GOLD BOOK FOR THIS SCHOOL YEAR 
THIS I WORKED OUT TEACHERS AND PARENTS IS OUR SEVENTEENTH GOLD BOOK FOR WELFORD PRIMARY SCHOOL 
OUR FIRST ENTRIES HERE FOR OUR NEW GOLD BOOK FOR OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN 
THIRTY SIX CHILDREN WHO'VE DONE SO WELL 
THIS HALF TERM THAT THEIR TEACHERS HAVE CHOSEN THEM 
FIVE W. FIAD 
REALLY PLEASED AND I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING MR. ODIN DID COME IN TO CHECK 
WAS IT TRUE WAS FIAD IN THE GOLD BOOK DIDN'T YOU MR. ODIN 
HE REALLY HAS WORKED HARD AND SHOWN A REALLY SENSIBLE ATTITUDE 
FIAD I'M REALLY PLEASED 
WELL DONE YOU KEEP THAT UP 
CERY'S MUMS VISITING RELATIVES IN JAMAICA WHICH IS A PITY 
SO I'LL HAVE TO WRITE HER A SPECIAL LETTER OVER TO JAMAICA AREN'T I CERY TO MAKE SURE SHE KNOWS 
CERY'S ANOTHER ONE THAT'S HAD A REALLY GOOD START TO YEAR FIVE AND WORKED REALLY HARD 
GIVE THEM A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE 
WELL DONE 
IBRAM AND UMABEEBAA I THINK UMABEEBAA'S GOT OUR LONGEST NAME 
IN SCHOOL AND I HAD TO WRITE IT VERY CAREFULLY ON HER CERTIFICATE 
NATHANUAL 
AND NATHANUAL'S BEEN AWARDED A GOLD STAR FOR FRENCH 
WELL DONE NATHANUAL THIS IS WHERE I LIKE TO COME AND HAVE A LOOK FROM HERE 
CHILDREN I'M REALLY PLEASED WITH YOU 
ONE OF THE BEST BITS OF MY JOB IS TO BE PROUD OF WHAT THE CHILDREN DO AT OUR SCHOOL 
PARENTS YOU MUST BE PROUD OF THEM AS WELL 
GIVE THEM A BIG BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE WELL DONE 
IT MAKES ME FEEL THE BEST 
IT MAKES ME FEEL WHAT I WANTED TO BE 
WHAT I WANTED TO BE A LANGUAGE TALKER 
O. K. I WILL GIVE YOU A SHAPE 
IT'S THE AFTERNOON AND MR. WILLS' CLASS ARE DOING MATHS 
A PENTAGON WITH A RIGHT ANGLE 
THAT MEANS ONE OF YOU 
IT'S GEOMETRY WITH A TWIST 
LIKE THIS AS NEAR AS YOU CAN GET THAT WAS RUBBISH 
GOOD O. K. LIKE THAT 
ALL RIGHT WE'LL START OFF EASY 
RECTANGLE 
I THINK I'VE CHANGED HOW I TEACH 
I'VE CERTAINLY BECOME LESS PRESCRIPTIVE IN HOW I TEACH 
I USE THE KIDS OWN INTERESTS RATHER THAN COMING IN AND TELLING THEM 
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IT IN THIS WAY 
HAVING LIVED AND WORKED IN THE AREA MOST OF HIS LIFE HE'S SEEN A CHANGE OUTSIDE WELFORD TOO 
CERTAINLY FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS OR SO PEOPLE HAVE LIVED SIDE BY SIDE AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY 
BUT IT'S WORKED ITS WAY THROUGH A LOT FURTHER THEN IT MAY HAVE IN OTHER PLACES 
DESPITE THE DIFFERENCES MR. WILLS IS BEGINNING TO SEE A COMMON IDENTITY IN TODAY'S CHILDREN 
IT'S KIND OF MAINTAINING YOUR OWN IDENTITY WHILE BEING PART OF A DIVERSE COMMUNITY 
IT'S INTEGRATING WITHOUT LOSING YOUR OWN SENSE OF SELF 
RIGHT I WANT AN ICOSOGAN INCLUDING ALL OF YOU 
GO BACK WHERE YOU WERE 
OH I'M SO SCARED ARE YOU 
THE CHILDREN ARE GETTING READY FOR THE HINDU FESTIVAL OF DIWALI 
WITH ALL SCHOOLS OBLIGED TO HAVE A DAILY ACT OF WORSHIP THE CHILDREN'S FAITH IS A SENSITIVE ISSUE 
I'M LIKE AN ATHEIST I'M CHRISTIAN 
I'M A MUSLIM AND I'M PROUD TO BE ONE 
I'D MAINLY SAY I'M A BIT OF BOTH HINDU AND SIKH 
I'LL ASK MY MUM 
AND I'LL TELL YA 
WELFORD'S APPROACH IS TO CELEBRATE ALL THE CHILDREN'S RELIGIONS IN ASSEMBLIES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR 
PLEASE DON'T TOUCH 
SAUBIA AND CONRAD ARE IN THE SCHOOL PLAY 
HAVE YOU LEARNED THE DANCE 
I AM PLAYING A DEMOND 
IT'S THE FESTIVAL OF LIGHT AND IT'S SORT OF LIKE CHRISTMAS TO SIKHS AND HINDUS 
THEY HAVE GODS LIKE WE DO LIKE I HAVE JESUS AND GOD AND THEY HAVE LIKE RAMA AND SITA 
THAT'S NOT THEIR GODS IT'S TRUE 
WELL I THINK I DON'T KNOW 
O. K. SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO ENJOY YOURSELF I WANT TO SEE EVERYBODY SMILING 
LET'S GET LINED UP AND GET IN THE HALL 
WHEN WE'RE READY TO START SHE WILL LIGHT YOUR CANDLE FOR YOU 
PARENTS TURN UP TO SUPPORT THEIR KIDS 
SAUBIA HAS ONE OF THE MAIN PARTS SO DAD AHMED HAS COME TO WATCH 
MR. SMITH HAS INSTALLED 
A CERTAIN CULTURE AT SCHOOL 
HE INTEGRATES EVERYBODY'S RELIGION SO IT'S NOT PURELY 
WE CONCENTRATE MORE ON ASIAN RELIGIONS LIKE SIKHS OR MUSLIMS 
WE TAKE ON ALL THE RELIGIONS 
AND THAT'S WHAT I TRY TO TEACH THE GIRLS AS WELL 
TO NOT LOSE THEIR MUSLIM IDENTITY BUT THERE AGAIN TO EMBRACE OTHER 
CULTURES AS WELL AND LIFESTYLES 
HA HA HA NOW YOU ARE MINE 
PLEASE HELP ME WON'T SOMEONE HELP ME 
I DON'T WANT TO BE A FARMER'S WIFE IF I DON'T CHANGE MY MIND 
HE'S GOING TO CHOP ME UP INTO PIECES AND EAT ME FOR BREAKFAST 
YOUR FIRST WRITING 
DESPITE THE FUN AND CELEBRATIONS BAJDAR IS WORRIED 
NATHANUAL HASN'T BEEN AT SCHOOL 
I DON'T KNOW WHERE NATHANUAL IS 
I THINK HE'S SICK OR HE'S GONE SOMEWHERE 
HE'S BEEN SICK FOR A LONG WHILE I DON'T KNOW WHY HE'S BEEN ILL FOR THAT LONG 
WITHOUT HIM IT'S NOT FUN 
HE'S GOOD AT FOOTBALL FINGERS CROSSED I HOPE HE'S COME BACK 
I HOPE HE COMES BACK ON MONDAY I HOPE 
PLEASE GOD 
IT'S DECEMBER AND BAJDAR'S GOT HIS WISH 
AFTER A WEEK AWAY BECAUSE OF FAMILY ISSUES NATHANUAL'S BACK WITH A RADICAL HAIRCUT 
MY BROTHER DONE IT WITH THE CLIPPERS LAST NIGHT 
WAS YOU SLEEPING NO I WAS AWAKE AND HE SHAVED IT ALL OFF 
BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING TOO BIG AND YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP SMART 
SMART BOY 
TWO SMART BOYS IN THE CLASS ME AND NATHANUAL 
THE LONGEST TERM OF THE YEAR IS COMING TO AN END AND EVERYONE'S GETTING TIRED 
RIGHT YOU LOT ALL IN COME ON EVERYBODY IN 
BUT THERE'S ONE LAST PIECE OF BUSINESS TO BE ATTENDED TO 
YOU ALL RIGHT GIRLS YEAH O. K. 
MISS RAHNA SOMEBODY WHO'S MADE YOU PLEASED THIS MORNING PLEASE 
WHO WAS THAT 
WE DON'T NEED IT 
COME ON QUICKLY O. K. WHAT DO YOU WANT THEM TO DO 
GRAB YOURSELVES 
EITHER TWO RED OR TWO GOLD BELLS 
EVERY YEAR THE CHILDREN DECORATE THE CHRISTMAS TREE 
AND FOR MR. SMITH A RARE MOMENT TO REFLECT 
THE TERM'S COME TO AN END AND IT'S UNBELIEVABLE REALLY 
COS IT'S SEEMED LIKE THAT SINCE SEPTEMBER 
THAT IS SUPER IT'S BEEN THE USUAL TERM OF UPS AND DOWN AT WELFORD 
THINGS WE'VE ENJOYED THOROUGHLY SOME OTHER BITS THAT ARE CHALLENGING 
CAN YOU REACH UP THERE WITH YOUR GOLD ONE 
I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE YOU KNOW 
HAVE YOU NOT 
YOU'VE DONE IT NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR CHRISTMAS 
I WANT A NINTENDO WII 
YOU CAN'T ASK FOR THAT IT'S ABOUT SPIRITUAL STUFF 
THINK OF SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT NOT WHAT YOU WANT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH IT 
I WANT AN X. BOX THREE HUNDRED SIXTY A PSP A PLAYSTATION TWO PLAYSTATION ONE A PLAYSTATION THREE 
NINTENDO WII NICE CLOTHES SOME SHOES 
I WANT SOME PYJAMAS YOU KNOW AND SOME COOK STUFF YEAH 
PYJAMAS NICE HAVE YOU GOT A PROBLEM 
RIGHT 
USE THE METAL HOOK AND HOOK IT OVER THAT BRANCH 
I THINK I'M A MUCH RICHER PERSON FOR HAVING GROWN UP HERE AND HAVING TAUGHT HERE 
I THINK IT'S 
CERTAINLY INFLUENCED HOW I SEE THE WORLD AND HOW I SEE BRITAIN AND HOW IT SHOULD BE 
THE SCHOOL'S STRENGTH IS IN ITS MIX 
MRS. MCKAY BELIEVES AS IMMIGRATION CONTINUES TO CHANGE BRITAIN 
ALL CHILDREN WOULD BENEFIT FROM ITS APPROACH 
WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU'RE DOING WITHIN THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT YOU TRY TO DEVELOP 
THE CHILDREN'S PRIDE IN THEIR OWN CULTURE AND IN THEMSELVES 
THERE HAS BEEN A DECREASE IN THE WHITE INDIGENOUS POPULATION 
THROUGHOUT THE TWENTY SEVEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE 
AND I THINK IT IS A SHAME BECAUSE THEY WOULD ACTUALLY VALUE 
WHAT'S ENRICHING THE SCHOOL HERE 
GOOD GIRL 
YEAH IT'S O. K. 
MR. HEALEY 
AND AFTER SEVENTEEN YEARS IN THE JOB WELFORD PRIMARY STILLS HOLDS ITS MAGIC FOR CHRIS SMITH 
IT IS SPECIAL TO ME IT'S BECOME MY 
NOT LIFE'S WORK BUT CERTAINLY THE KEY PART OF MY WORKING LIFE 
AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO WALK AWAY FROM 
AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO WALK AWAY FROM IT 
IT'S BEEN A JOY 
A GOLD ONE HERE 
WE SHOULD ALL BE MINDFUL IN EDUCATION 
THAT WE ARE PRODUCING THE CITIZENS OF THE FUTURE 
AND WE MUST NEVER BE COMPLACENT 
NEVER SIT BACK AND THINK YOU'VE CRACKED IT BECAUSE YOU NEVER HAVE 
A DRIVE TO KEEP ON HELPING THE CHILDREN
