YOU WERE MARRIED YES I WAS YOUR HUSBAND WAS A BUILDER YES 
SADLY PASSED AWAY HOW LONG AGO NINE YEARS NOW O. K.

ALEC WHAT DO YOU BRING TO THIS

WHAT SORT OF THING ARE YOU LOOKING FOR

AND A SMALL GARDEN WELL SOMETHING MANAGEABLE I DON'T MIND BIG IF IT'S MANAGEABLE 
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU GOT TO SPEND I THINK I CAN PUSH MYSELF TO THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY O. K. THAT'S A GOOD BUDGET

EPPING FOREST IS NEARBY FOR WALKS THERE ARE LOTS OF SMALL BOROUGHS WITH MANY GREEN SPACES 
SURROUNDED BY LOCAL AMENITIES IT'S REALLY EASY TO REACH CENTRAL LONDON BY RAIL OR UNDERGROUND

THIS WHOLE AREA WILL HAVE UNDERGONE HUGE REGENERATION WITH MANY NEW HOMES AND BUSINESSES 
MAKING IT A VERY DESIRABLE AREA

WHAT ABOUT THIS FOUR BEDROOMED DETACHED FARMHOUSE AT CAERNARFON 
SURROUNDED BY STUNNING COUNTRYSIDE IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

NO ALREADY DOWNSIZING WE KNEW IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TOO SMALL IT ALWAYS DOES 
IT'S NOT MUCH SMALLER THAN AT HOME 
THERE YOU GO IS THAT GOOD OR BAD 
FIREPLACE DO YOU RECKON THAT'S A WORKING FIREPLACE THIS IS THAT COMPOSITE STUFF 
IT'S NICE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S REAL 
IT WILL BE A GAS FIRE 
MAYBE YOU COULD KNOCK THAT THROUGH YOU COULD MAKE IT LOOK BIGGER 
GIVE DEBBIE HER DUE THAT'S A GREAT COMMENT I WOULD HAVE THAT AS ONE BIG ROOM ABSOLUTELY 
THERE'S A POOL TABLE IN THE HALLWAY WE USED TO HAVE ONE OF THESE YES 
WE DID THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF SPACE IT'S A BIG HALL 
IT'S A REALLY BIG HALL YEAH IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT'S A WASTE OF SPACE ISN'T IT 
YOU COULD PUT A DOWNSTAIRS TOILET HERE POSSIBLY LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
YOU COULD PUT THE COMPUTER UNDERNEATH THOSE STAIRS 
THIS IS VERY NICE THIS IS LOVELY MUM 
YEAH IT IS LOVELY NOT TOO BIG NOT TOO SMALL GREAT KITCHEN CUM DINER IT IS 
THE GARDEN'S QUITE SPACIOUS BIG 
THAT'S NOT THAT BIG THAT'S NOT A BIG GARDEN DOM 
SHE DID SAY A GARDEN WITH NO MAINTENANCE YOU COULD CUT THAT LAWN WITH NAIL CLIPPERS 
LOOK MUM OH WOW A UTILITY ROOM 
WITH A COMBINATION BOILER 
THAT'S SOMETHING SHE HASN'T GOT 
IT'S LOVELY WITH A SECOND SINK OH THERE YOU GO 
A TOILET A DOWNSTAIRS LOO 
A UTILITY ROOM AND LOVELY DOWNSTAIRS TOILET DOWNSTAIRS LAVVY A LOVELY ROYAL THRONE 
CAN WE GO UPSTAIRS YEAH GO ON 
THAT'S THE WHOLE OF THE DOWNSTAIRS IT WAS ALL A BIT BLAND NO EXCITEMENT THERE 
THERE WERE NO NEGATIVE WORDS WAS IT GOOD OR WAS IT BAD 
FOR ME DOMINIC IT WAS GREAT 
I'M LIKE THAT I DON'T KNOW 
THAT'S A NICE SIZED ROOM DEFINITELY THAT'S GOOD ARSENAL FAN 
GOOD SIZE VERY GOOD SIZE 
IT DOESN'T 
IT DOES IT'S LIKE A SHARED EN SUITE MAYBE A SHARED ONE YEAH 
IT'S A JACK AND JILL BATHROOM YOU CAN OPEN ONE DOOR CLOSE ONE OPEN ONE DOOR CLOSE ONE 
IN HERE MUST BE THE SMALLEST ROOM YEAH I WONDER HOW DEEP THIS IS FOR STORAGE 
THINK THEY'D MIND GREY AREA SHOULD YOU LOOK INSIDE THEIR CUPBOARDS OR NOT YES 
IT'S DEFINITELY BIGGER THAN HIS ROOM AT THE MOMENT WHAT WOULD YOU THINK THOUGH THIS FOR CARLOS 
SHE'S TRYING TO PICTURE THE BOYS NOT TRYING SHE IS PUTTING THE BOYS MENTALLY IN THE BEDROOMS 
SHE'S MENTALLY MOVING IN 
THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM OBVIOUSLY 
A BIT SMALLER THAN YOURS AT HOME ONLY PROBLEM IS STORAGE 
I WANT TO DOWNSIZE BUT IT'S SMALLER THAN YOURS AT HOME EXCUSE ME A MOMENT 
THAT'S BETTER THAT'S NOT NICE 
IF WE COULD GET UP INTO THE LOFT POTENTIALLY A FOURTH DOUBLE ROOM TO COMPENSATE FOR THE SMALL MASTER 
YOU DON'T WANT THAT IT'S HANGING IN THE BALANCE 
MAYBE THE EN SUITE COULD BE MADE SMALLER TO CREATE MORE ROOM SPACE 
THAT'S A GOOD COMMENT THE VIEWS ARE NICE NICE NOT HAVING ANYONE AT THE BACK OF YOU 
I CAN'T HELP FEELING YOU'VE FAILED HERE BUT LET'S FIND OUT FOR SURE HAVE FAITH 
ALEC I'M REALLY NOT QUITE SURE HOW YOU AND YOUR MUM FEEL ABOUT THIS 
BUT IF IT WAS MINE SOMETHING I WOULD REALLY REALLY CONSIDER DOING IS THIS 
WHAT YOU'VE GOT THERE IS THE BEAUTIFUL CARCASS FOR A GARAGE BUT IT'S AN OPEN CAR PORT 
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE HARD TO GET TWO GARAGE DOORS PUT UP 
TO BE FLASH ELECTRIC DOORS BUT THESE LITTLE CROSSBEAMS HERE ARE ALMOST CERTAINLY ORNAMENTAL 
THE MAIN STRUCTURE'S THERE JUST DECORATIVE UP AND OVER DOORS NOT THAT DEAR 
AND IT WOULD BE A BIG IMPROVEMENT I WOULDN'T EVEN THINK TWICE 
AND IT WOULD MORE THAN LIKELY ADD VALUE EXACTLY 
A CAR PORT BECOMES A DOUBLE GARAGE 
PUT ME OUT OF MY MISERY DID YOU LIKE IT I DID 
YOU DID YOU SOUNDED A LITTLE RESERVED IT WAS JUST THE SIZE WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
THE SIZE OF THE FRONT LOUNGE TOO TOO SMALL TOO SMALL 
DO YOU WANT TO RUN ME PAST THAT DOWNSIZING THING WE TALKED ABOUT 
DO YOU WANT TO TALK ME THROUGH THAT I DID WANT BIGGER BEDROOMS AND BIGGER RECEPTION ROOMS AS WELL 
OH YOU'RE OUTRAGEOUS THIS COULD BE CURED YOU DON'T NEED THIS SPLIT 
THE OFFICE CUM LOUNGE SCENARIO LOSE THIS WALL HERE 
IT'S NOT A BIG SCARY JOB AT ALL COMPUTER UNDER THE STAIRCASE AND YOU'VE OPENED UP 
A FANTASTIC SIZE YOU'RE SMILING HAVE I MADE YOU HAPPY VERY GOOD 
WILL I MAKE YOU HAPPY ON THE PRICE WE'LL SEE COME ON 
O. K. YOU'VE HAD A GOOD NOSE ROUND AND NOW IT IS GUESS THE PRICE TIME 
EVERY TIME WE SHOW YOU A PROPERTY WE WANT YOU TO INDEPENDENTLY GUESS THE VALUE OF EACH HOUSE 
WHO HAS THEIR FINGER ON THE PROPERTY PULSE SO DEBBIE WHAT DO YOU THINK WHAT DO YOU PRICE IT AT 
I'D SAY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE O. K. VERY PRECISE O. K. ALEC IT'S OVER TO YOU 
I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S WORTH LESS BUT I'LL GO HIGHER SINCE IT'S DETACHED NICE GARAGE 
AND FOR THE YEAR OF BUILD IT'S GOT QUITE A LOT OF SQUARE METREAGE 
SO SOUNDS LIKE AN ESTATE AGENT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE O. K. 
YOU'RE ACTUALLY BOTH QUITE CLOSE BUT ALEC HAS NICKED THIS ONE 
THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE YOU SAID IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONLY FIVE GRAND OUT VERY CLOSE 
WITH AN OFFER YOU MIGHT GET IT DOWN ABSOLUTELY 
WE COULDN'T WORK OUT IF YOU LIKED IT OR NOT BUT WAIT TILL YOU SEE MY ONE NUMBER TWO YOU'LL BE EXCITED 
COME ON THIS WAY 
IF THIS IS THE ONE FOR DEBBIE THERE'S ONE THING TO CONSIDER 
IF TURNING A FOUR INTO A THREE BED DO YOUR HOMEWORK 
A THREE BED PROPERTY IS MUCH LESS SALEABLE 
AND MAY AFFECT THE PRICE IF SHE MOVES ON 
PROPERTY TWO IS MY CHOICE AND I AM CONFIDENT SHE WILL LOVE IT 
IT'S JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM ALEC SO LOCATION SHOULD BE PERFECT 
THIS LARGE HOUSE IS BRIGHT AND AIRY WITH STUNNING GOLF COURSE VIEWS 
KRISTIAN'S CHOICE OF PROPERTY DID NOT LIGHT ANY FIRES AT ALL 
YOU WAS EMOTIONLESS NO YOU WAS 
SPEECHLESS EMOTIONLESS THINGS ARE ABOUT TO CHANGE 
HERE IS MY CHOICE BURKETT LODGE 
YOU COULD BE LIVING HERE COULDN'T YOU 
I'M SO DESPISING YOU RIGHT NOW 
FOUR YEARS OLD THERE'S NOTHING FOR YOU TO DO AS FAR AS WORK GOES AND THAT GOES FOR THE GROUNDS TOO 
ALL THE BEDROOMS MODERN I'LL STOP WAFFLING WHAT DO YOU THINK 
WELL WE'LL HAVE A LOOK NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THE LOCATION 
THE OUTSIDE ISN'T THE BEST NO YOU WHAT 
IT'S IT'S WHERE IT'S SET I THINK THERE WAS A MUCH BIGGER AND BETTER RESPONSE TO MY PROPERTY 
BUT TO BACK DOMINIC'S CHOICE UP VISUALLY I THINK IT LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE MANOR HOUSE YES 
I'LL GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT PLEASE DO I'LL LOOK INSIDE 
AND IT'S ON THREE LEVELS SO THERE'S LOADS OF SPACE TO WANDER AROUND ENJOY SAVOUR 
AND DON'T BE SO HARD ON DOM ENJOY THE PROPERTY 
YEAH GO ON GO ON 
THIS IS QUITE NICE 
RIGHT HOUSE TWO DIGBY LET'S SEE IF THIS ONE SPARKS SOME LIFE INTO HER WE'LL SEE YEAH 
I DO LIKE THIS ROOM ALEC IT'S GOT LOTS OF LIGHT YEAH 
NANNY'S FURNITURE 
WELL MAYBE 
AT LEAST THEY'RE GIGGLING 
THE VIEW'S VERY NICE IT'S GOT TWO SOURCES OF LIGHT 
YES YEAH THE OLD SASH WINDOWS OR SASH TYPE DOUBLE GLAZING WINDOWS 
O. K. DOM HASN'T DONE TOO BAD IN HERE NOT SO FAR 
THIS WILL BE INTERESTING THEY LIKE THIS AND THE FIRST PROPERTY AS WELL WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING ALL RIGHT 
IT'S A WEIRD SHAPED ROOM TO FURNISH 
THERE'S THE ROAD OUTSIDE AS WELL IS IT A BUSY ROAD YEAH IT IS ESPECIALLY IN THE MORNINGS 
I LIKE THAT WALL AT A SLIGHT ANGLE IT'S QUIRKY INDIVIDUAL UNIQUE 
THERE'S NO T. V. OH 
OH GOSH THAT'S A PROBLEM 
O. K. YOU'D PUT IT WHERE THE HI FI IS I GUESS 
WHAT I FIND REMARKABLE ABOUT PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A T. V. 
THEY'VE NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OR JOY OF SEEING TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY 
GOOD POINT YEAH LIFE WOULD NOT BE WORTH LIVING NO 
THIS IS QUITE A NICE KITCHEN WOW QUITE A NICE SIZE A LOT BIGGER THAN I IMAGINED 
THE INTERIOR IS MUCH NICER THAN THE EXTERIOR 
AH SEE INTERNALLY NOT BAD 
THEY ARE WEIRD SHAPED ROOMS THOUGH THEY'VE ALL GOT ANGLES ALL GOT ANGLES YEAH ANGLES 
SHE'S RIGHT THE ROOMS DO HAVE ODD SHAPES I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE IT 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAY OUT IT'S ALMOST CONTRIVED TO MAKE SURE THE ROOMS HAVE SOME PERSONALITY 
I GUESS THIS COULD BE A DINING ROOM 
MAYBE MAYBE 
YEAH IT'S LIKE A SECOND IT COULD BE A STUDY OR A DINING ROOM 
I'D USE IT AS A DINING ROOM 
AH LITTLE DOES SHE KNOW THAT IS ACTUALLY THE THIRD BEDROOM YEAH 
COULD BE A PROBLEM 
OH WOW THERE YOU ARE 
A BATHROOM IT'S THE BATHROOM 
HAVEN'T GOT A SHOWER THOUGH WE COULD PUT A SHOWER IN 
I'M NOT REALLY SENSING FIREWORKS NO IT'S WORRYING ME 
YEAH O. K. THERE'S ENOUGH SPACE FOR TWO SINKS IF YOU REALLY WANT 
I'M NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THIS 
WE'RE NOT REALLY GETTING ANY EMOTIONS AT ALL NO PASSION 
EVERYTHING'S JUST A WEIRD SHAPE ANOTHER FUNNY LAMPSHADE YEAH 
IT'S NOT A VERY BIG ROOM THOUGH ONLY BECAUSE OF THE CEILING 
PROBABLY FLOOR SPACE IS VERY GOOD 
EVEN THOUGH IT'S A NEW BUILD AND DECORATED IN A NEUTRAL NEW ISH 
WAY THERE'S A LOT OF CHARACTER IN THAT BUILDING LIKE THAT STAIRCASE 
IF YOU BUY IT YOU CAN DO SO MUCH IN THERE TO MAKE IT REALLY ZING 
HERE WE HAVE ANOTHER SHOWER ROOM I GUESS THIS IS THE EN SUITE ROOM 
I REALLY DON'T LIKE IT 
I'LL PUT MY HANDS UP MAYBE SHE'S JUST VERY HARD TO PLEASE MAYBE I HAVE FAILED 
MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T PICKED THE RIGHT HOUSE 
LOOK AT THIS ROOM THAT'S A NICE SIZED ROOM 
THE BED'S VERY NICE SIZE 
BUT AGAIN STORAGE YOU'VE GOT A WALK IN WARDROBE OH I SEE O. K. 
LOTS OF NATURAL LIGHT AGAIN NO THIS IS A NICE ROOM 
BUT THERE'S A STICKING POINT MUM WHAT WHERE'S THE THIRD BEDROOM 
OH THEY'VE REALISED UNLESS THEY'VE ONLY GOT TWO WE MISSED A ROOM DOWNSTAIRS 
OH COULD BE THE PENNY'S DROPPED SHE'S REALISED THAT'S NOT THE DINING ROOM IT'S THE THIRD BEDROOM 
VERY HIGH UP THE WINDOWS THE CEILINGS ARE HIGH AS WELL EVEN THOUGH WE'RE UPSTAIRS 
THE DOG MIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM HE WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE OUT THE WINDOW 
I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO EARN OUR KEEP AND PERSUADE THEM OF THE POSITIVE ASPECTS HEAR HEAR DIGBY 
YOU SHOULD CUT ME SOME SLACK THIS HOUSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IS QUITE SUITABLE FOR YOU 
LET'S WORK OUT WHAT YOU WANTED A NICE KITCHEN 
YEAH GOT IT YEAH RIGHT 
YOU WANTED SOMETHING THAT HAD NICE SIZED BEDROOMS THE THIRD BEDROOM'S NOT QUITE THERE 
YOU'VE GOT YOUR THREE BEDROOMS IT'S HARD TO FIND ANYTHING EXACTLY AS YOU WANT IT 
NOW IT'S NOT FREEHOLD IT'S LEASEHOLD RIGHT AND YOU'LL PAY A LEASE EACH YEAR OF JUST OVER NINE HUNDRED 
O. K. NOW THAT DOES MEAN THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE MAINTENANCE OF THESE GROUNDS 
THEY'RE COMMUNAL YOU CAN ALL USE THEM BUT NO WORK AT ALL O. K. 
PAY YOUR LEASE EACH YEAR AND JUST GET ON WITH LIVING 
AND TAKING CARE OF YOUR BOYS O. K. 
AM I CUTTING ANY ICE NO I REALLY DON'T LIKE THE LOCATION 
SORRY KRISTIAN WILL GIVE ME SUCH A H. ARD TIM E. 
I PREFERRED KRISTIAN'S PROPERTY NO 
SO YOU HAD A LOOK WITH YOUR MUM NOW YOU SEEMED SLIGHTLY TEPID ON THE WHOLE THING 
WHAT DO YOU REALLY THINK OF IT IT IS A LOVELY HOME RIGHT BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A HOME 
RIGHT AND THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THE LACK OF BEDROOMS 
O. K. FIRST OFF IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A HOME I THINK THE VENDOR HAS DONE THAT THING OF DEPERSONALISING 
BUT MAYBE GONE ONE STEP TOO FAR THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THAT BASICALLY YOU HAVE NO DINING SPACE 
THIS ROOM HERE WOULD HAVE TO BE YOUR THIRD BEDROOM RIGHT 
O. K. COME ROUND HERE A LITTLE BIT THE ONLY DINING SPACE YOU'VE GOT IS WEDGED IN JUST THERE YEAH 
I'VE TRIED TO THINK OF A SOLUTION AND I THINK THE BEST SOLUTION IS DOWN AT THE BOTTOM 
YOU HAVE A LITTLE PATIO AREA 
YOU COULD GO FOR OUTLINE PLANNING PERMISSION TO CONVERT THAT INTO A REALLY NICE DINING SPACE 
AND PUT A DOORWAY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS YEAH 
THAT WOULD MAKE A SENSATIONAL LONG DINING ROOM SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR KITCHEN CUM DINER HERE 
THE BEDROOM THERE AND A FANTASTIC ALL SINGING ALL DANCING DINING ROOM WHAT DO YOU THINK NOT BAD 
HERE WE ARE AGAIN GUESS THE PRICE YOU WERE CLOSE ON THE LAST HOUSE 
I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S EVEN WORTH THE EFFORT OH COME ON I FEEL DEFLATED WHY 
YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL WHY ALL THREE OF YOU IT'S LOVELY 
IT'S A LOVELY HOUSE I'LL PLAY ANYHOW IF I COULD PICK IT UP AND TAKE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE I WOULD 
THAT'S A LIE EVEN THEN YOU WOULDN'T BE HAPPY O. K. DEBBIE 
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK IT IS WELL 
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO VALUE BUT I WOULD SAY 
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE O. K. 
VERY INTERESTING ALEC 
I THINK MUM'S RIGHT BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH THAT 
BASED ON IT BEING LEASEHOLD WITH A BIG MANAGEMENT FEE 
I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY WORTH THREE HUNDRED THIRTY O. K. 
DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT YOUR MUM'S RIGHT 
GIVE US A KISS YOU WERE ALMOST SPOT ON THE PRICE IS THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND 
A FIVER OUT AND THIRTY THOUSAND OUT 
VERY CLOSE WHAT CAN I SAY O. K. THAT ONE'S DONE AND DUSTED 
THE THIRD PROPERTY WE'VE CHOSEN IT TOGETHER IS THIS WAY COME ON 
NOW ALTHOUGH THERE'S ONE HUNDRED TWENTY YEARS LEFT 
ON THIS LODGE HOUSE LEASE IF IT WAS LESS THAN FIFTY FIVE YEARS 
YOU PROBABLY COULDN'T EVEN GET A MORTGAGE WITHOUT EXTENDING IT 
WE'RE FLYING BY THE SEAT OF OUR PANTS AS THE THIRD PROPERTY IS THE WILD CARD 
THIS HOUSE HAS BEEN REFURBISHED TO THE MAX WITH A COUPLE OF NICE LITTLE SURPRISES THROWN IN 
HERE WE ARE AT THE WILD CARD AND THE REASON WE HAVE CHOSEN THIS 
THE REASON WHY IT IS WILD IS YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO DOWNSIZE 
AND WE GUESSED YOU WERE SO USED TO HAVING A LARGE HOUSE THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU WILL WANT TO BUY NEXT 
O. K. SO BEAR WITH ME 
THIS PROPERTY HERE ACRES OF SPACE 
AND ONE THING YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT A HUGE GARDEN TOO MUCH WORK 
NO YOU'LL LOVE IT EXCITED 
IT'S LOVELY FROM THE OUTSIDE YOU LIKE IT WHAT IN PARTICULAR 
IT'S GOT A TUDOR STYLE TO IT MOCK TUDOR I THINK YOU WOULD SAY IT'S ABOUT NINETEEN THIRTIES O. K. 
RIGHT YOU KNOW THE SCORE GET IN AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK THANK YOU 
I'VE A FEELING THEY'LL LIKE IT YOU THINK SO YES 
IN MY WATERS DOM I THINK THIS WILL BE VERY GOOD 
THIS IS A NICE ROOM VERY PLEASANT 
OH THAT FIREPLACE IS GORGEOUS I LIKE THE FIREPLACE AS WELL 
THAT FIREPLACE IS WHAT MY SISTER'S GOT IS THAT A SIGN OF QUALITY YEAH 
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE FOUND US THE IDEAL HOME MM 
IF THEY PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER I LIKE TO GET MY HEAD TOGETHER 
LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE PINCHED THE SPACE WHAT WOULD YOU USE THAT FOR DO YOU THINK 
JUST A T. V. OR YOU COULD PUT ANOTHER SOFA IN 
SHE'S BEING VERY SUBDUED AGAIN 
THEY'RE BOTH QUITE QUIET WHEN HOUSE HUNTING 
IT'S NOT ABOUT ENERGY OR EXCITEMENT THEY'RE JUST QUITE RESERVED YES THEY ARE I THINK SO 
IT'S SMALL VERY TITCHY 
IT'S SMALL BUT IT'S O. K. WATCH YOUR HEAD 
IT'S NOT BAD A SMALL LAV ALL YOU NEED IN A LAVVY IS SOMEWHERE TO SIT AND TO PUT YOUR MAGAZINES 
LOOK AT THIS 
THIS IS NICE GRANITE WORKTOPS YOU CAN TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS 
GRANITE WORKTOPS FIVE GRAND'S WORTH VERY NICE 
OH WOW LOOK I LIKE THIS THIS IS GORGEOUS YEAH VERY NICE 
GORGEOUS WE'RE HEARING A WORD HERE THEY'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU BUT THAT LOVELY CHERRY WOOD KITCHEN 
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE SHOWN ANY REAL EMOTION GORGEOUS 
THERE'S A NICE DINING AREA AND LOADS OF WORK SPACE 
A BIG AMERICAN FRIDGE THAT'S REALLY NICE REALLY NICE 
I DO LIKE THIS PROPERTY 
STORAGE IS EVERYWHERE IN THIS HOUSE YEAH THE OWNERS HAVE MADE EVERY LITTLE AVAILABLE SPACE 
EVERY LITTLE NOOK AND CRANNY 
THERE MUST BE STORAGE IN HERE THERE'S PLENTY OF STORAGE 
THAT'S GOOD A BIT LIKE OURS IT IS ACTUALLY VERY SIMILAR 
PEOPLE ARE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THINGS THEY'RE USED TO FAMILIARITY 
GO UPSTAIRS YES 
NOW THE BEDROOM ACCOMMODATION WHICH WITH THE OTHER PROPERTIES WAS A STUMBLING BLOCK YEAH 
O. K. THIS MUST BE THE MASTER BEDROOM I'M NOT SURE OF THE COLOUR BUT 
NO I THINK I'D CHANGE THE GREEN IT MAKES IT FEEL SMALLER 
YEAH MAYBE THAT WOULD OPEN IT UP 
OR TAKE ONE OF THE WARDROBES OUT THAT'S THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE STARTED TO TALK LIKE THAT 
THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED TO DO OWN THE SPACE MAKE IT THEIRS 
OH THIS HAS FITTED WARDROBES A FAIR SIZE 
THEY DO HAVE A LOT OF STORAGE PINE FITTED WARDROBES AREN'T THEY 
THEY'RE RATHER ODD WARDROBES BUT THEY'RE VERY NICE 
GOOD QUALITY A LOT OF SPACE BEHIND THEM AND THEY'RE VERY DEEP 
O. K. THERE'S DEFINITELY MORE SPACE HERE 
OH GOSH TALKING ABOUT SPACE ALEC 
THE KEY WORDS WE'RE GOING TO HEAR NOW ARE COMPACT AND BIJOU 
THAT'S DIFFICULT VERY DIFFICULT YOU DON'T TO HAVE TO DIVE IN 
YEAH SOMEONE'S GUARANTEED TO WHACK THEIR HEAD A FEW TIMES DEFINITELY 
I REALLY THINK GREAT HOUSE BUT THAT BATHROOM IS NOT NEEDED NO USE IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE 
PERHAPS JUST A TOILET AND SINK 
THIS IS PLEASANTLY THERE'S A NICE VIEW FROM HERE 
THEY'RE INTO THE FRONT BEDROOM A GREAT LITTLE BEDROOM YEAH IT'S QUITE FUNKY UP THERE 
NOT AS BIG AS I EXPECTED IT TO BE 
NO SEE AH IT DOES GO ROUND 
IT MAY NOT BE GIGANTIC BUT YOU CAN GET A DOUBLE BED IN 
IT LOOKS LIKE A MISUSE OF SPACE UNLESS THE DOOR'S THERE FOR FIRE REGULATIONS 
IT'S A FUNNY USE OF SPACE BUT IT'S VERY BRIGHT VERY BRIGHT AND PERFECT FOR US 
SHE CAN RELATE HER OWN PROPERTY TO THIS ONE IT'S VERY SIMILAR YEAH SEMI DETACHED 
SAME SORT OF STYLE IF IT'S SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHAT PEOPLE KNOW THEY'LL HAVE AN OPINION 
IF IT'S FAR REMOVED THEY'RE AT A LOSS SHE HAS A LOT MORE SAY NOW 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THIS GARDEN 
THE GARDEN IS ONE HUNDRED FOOT LONG BUT FIFTY FOOT IS PAVED OVER 
I LIKE THIS DOWN HERE THOUGH IT'S LIKE A LITTLE JUNGLE 
WELL 
I THINK IT'S MARSHLAND ACTUALLY IT IS MARSHLAND 
MARSHLAND IN ESSEX I DON'T THINK SO SOMEHOW 
IT'S LIKE A SECRET GARDEN 
THAT'S NICE FOR THE CHILDREN IT'S VERY MARSHY 
YOU WANT SUCCULENT GROUND FOR PLANTS EXACTLY MOISTURE 
YOU CAN SEE WHAT EVERYONE'S DOING IN THEIR BACK GARDENS FROM HERE 
WELL EVERYONE TO THEIR OWN 
I THINK WE'D NEED A BIT MORE PRIVACY MM 
LET'S GET IN AND GIVE THEM IDEAS RIGHT 
ONE THING YOU'VE GOT TO SAY IS IT'S A GREAT ATTIC CONVERSION HERE 
GREAT USE OF SPACE BUT I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THAT TOILET LAVVY AND SINK 
IT'S QUITE A TIGHT ROOM SIT YOUR BUM ON THE LAVVY 
THERE'S NO ROOM TO SWING A CAT BUT AS YOU SEE HERE 
THE OWNER HAS TRIED TO MAKE GOOD USE OF THE SPACE IT COULD BE BETTER 
IT'S SO TIGHT THE HANDLE OF THE LAVVY CLASHES WITH THE SINK 
AND THE TAP IS SO FAR UNDER HERE I MEAN LOOK AT THIS 
YOU HAVE TO GET IN LIKE THIS LOOK AT THAT 
THE TAPS ARE THERE THE CONVERSION'S GREAT BUT THIS IS WHAT I'D DO 
I'D GET RID OF THIS BATH 
I'D LEAVE THE LOO WHERE IT IS AND POSSIBLY MOVE THE SINK OVER 
JUST SO IT LOOKS RIGHT THERE'S NO ROOM RIGHT UP AGAINST THE LAVVY ROLL 
COULD WE NOT GET A SHOWER IN OH NO NO CHANCE HERE 
UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOSE THE SINK AND IT'S TOO TIGHT FOR SPACE 
MIND YOU WILLIE WONKA'S OOMPA LOOMPA MEN COULD SHOWER IN THERE 
RIGHT WE ARE BOLDLY GOING WHERE DEBBIE DOES NOT LIKE TO GO 
HAVE YOU A PHOBIA OF GARDENS IT'S THE WORK 
I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT HUGE NO I THINK IT'S MANAGEABLE 
IT IS THE ONE THING YOU NOTICED IS THAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT WET YES 
WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO A RIVER HERE AND IT IS A CLAY BASED SOIL 
O. K. SO IT IS GOING TO BE WET 
IF YOU LOOK AROUND HERE THERE'S A LOT OF WEEPING WILLOWS 
PEOPLE KNEW THE SOIL WAS WET AND PLANTED THOSE TO SUCK UP MOISTURE 
YOU KNOW YOUR GREEK PARTIES YES WE DO NEED THAT 
HERE IS YOUR ENTERTAINING SPACE 
YOUR BARBIE I CAN SEE YOU HERE JUST NEED IT A LITTLE BIT LARGER 
DEFINITELY TO ROAST THE WHOLE ANIMAL DEFINITELY 
ANY KIND OF ATTIC CONVERSION WOULD REQUIRE PLANNING PERMISSION 
YOU MIGHT NEED FIRE DOORS AND EXTRA WINDOWS SO THINK VERY CAREFULLY 
AND IF YOU WANT TO PUT FENCES UP 
REMEMBER WHICH SIDE YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR USUALLY THE RIGHT 
RATHER INTERESTING MUM THE FITTED WARDROBE CONSULTANT AGAINST SON THE ESTATE AGENT 
WHO WILL I ASK TO GO FIRST YOU OR ALEC 
I THINK IT SHOULD BE ALEC GO ON HOW MUCH FOR THIS ONE I'M ON THE SPOT 
I USUALLY COMPARE IT TO MUM'S FIGURE I LIKE YOUR STYLE 
E. H. THREE THIRTY FOUR ZERO ZERO ZERO O. K. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY MUM 
I SAY THREE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND 
THE ACTUAL PRICE IS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND YOU ARE THE CLOSEST 
O. K. FOR A GREAT BIG GARDEN GREAT BIG PROPERTY THAT'S NOT A BAD PRICE AT ALL 
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THERE ARE NO MORE LEFT TO SHOW YOU WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT BRAINS 
WE'VE PUT THE PICTURES OF ALL THREE PROPERTIES ON THIS LAPTOP AND WILL TRUST THIS WITH YOU 
WORK OUT WHICH ONE YOU WILL ROAD TEST TRY BEFORE YOU BUY WE'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU IN A WHILE 
THANK YOU CHEERIO BYE BYE HERE'S A QUICK RECAP FOR YOU OF THE THREE PROPERTIES 
WHICH ONE WILL DEBBIE CHOOSE NUMBER ONE GATED AND GORGEOUS 
THIS STYLISH PROPERTY HAS FOUR BEDROOMS AND A SUPER KITCHEN SLASH DINER 
OR WILL IT BE MODERN DETACHED AND IMMACULATE NUMBER TWO 
OR HOUSE NUMBER THREE DESPITE THE SIZE OF THE GARDEN WE THINK DEBBIE MIGHT FALL FOR ITS CHARM AND CHARACTER 
LET'S LOOK AT PROPERTY ONE THAT WAS QUITE A NICE PROPERTY I QUITE LIKED THAT ONE 
THAT WAS A GOOD SIZE QUITE GOOD 
IT ALSO HAD THE EN SUITE ON THE OTHER BEDROOM A TWO DOOR BATHROOM 
IT WAS LIKE AN EN SUITE FROM ONE AND A FAMILY FROM THE OTHER 
THAT'S THE TINY ROOM 
YEAH BUT THAT'S GOOD FOR STORAGE SHE'S USED IT FOR WARDROBES TO THE MASTER BEDROOM 
LET'S LOOK AT THE SECOND PROPERTY THE LOUNGE THAT HAD NO T. V. THAT'S RIGHT YEAH 
THIS IS THAT DINING ROOM NEXT TO THE KITCHEN THAT'S RIGHT TO BE THE THIRD BEDROOM 
IT WOULDN'T WORK WOULD IT NO HAVING SAID THAT 
THE HALLWAY IS A LARGE AREA AGAIN 
AND THE BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS WERE GOOD SIZES APART FROM THE FACT THAT THEY HAD THE SLOPING CEILINGS 
KITCHEN WAS LOVELY I DID LIKE IT THE KITCHEN WAS QUITE GOOD 
AND PROPERTY THREE THE LOFT CONVERSION WASN'T QUITE RIGHT AND THE GARDEN ACROSS THE BACK 
THE ONLY THING WAS THIS THE KITCHEN WAS BEAUTIFUL SO THE ONE WE SHOULD TEST YEAH 
SO AFTER ALL THAT DELIBERATION THE ONE YOU'VE DECIDED TO ROAD TEST IS PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
MY CHOICE THE RATHER SWISH OPEN SESAME 
WELL DONE GATED DEVELOPMENT 
A BEAUTIFUL PROPERTY BUT WHAT I WANT TO ASK YOU IS WHY YOU WANT TO TEST DRIVE THIS ONE 
AND NOT SO MUCH THE WILD CARD OR DOMINIC'S CHOICE 
MILK IT MILK IT MILK IT YOU SHOULD BE A DAIRY FARMER YOU 
WHY THAT I THINK IT'S BECAUSE IT'S DETACHED YEAH AND I REALLY LIKED IT KRISTIAN 
I THINK HE'S GOT YOU A GOOD CHOICE IT IS A LOVELY HOUSE 
YOU LIKE IT ALEC IT'S LOVELY 
SQUEEZED OUT BY MY OWN CHOICE 
COME BACK IN 
WITH THAT INTERLUDE I TELL YOU THE MAIN THING NOW BEFORE WE SEND YOU IN FOR THE TEST DRIVE 
OUR SURVEYOR GAVE IT THE ONCE OVER 
BEAR IN MIND IT'S NOT A LEGALLY BINDING SURVEY IF YOU DO DECIDE TO BUY THE HOUSE 
GET YOUR OWN INDEPENDENT ONE DONE 
THERE'S A COUPLE OF POINTS TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION COME WITH ME AND WITH ME 
OUR SURVEYOR HASN'T REALLY FOUND MANY FAULTS WITH THIS HOUSE 
BUT HE HAS POINTED OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD LOOK AT 
FIRSTLY A GREAT SHINGLE DRIVE 
BUT LOOK AT IT WHERE ARE YOUR BOUNDARIES 
DO THEY START HERE THIS PATH HERE NO ONE KNOWS DO THEY 
YOU'VE GOT TO GET THAT CHECKED OUT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU DRAW YOUR LINE ALSO THIS DRAINAGE SYSTEM IS PRIVATE BETWEEN HERE AND THE ROAD 
O. K. SOMEONE IS GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT IF IT GOES WRONG 
SOMEWHERE THERE WILL BE A PUMPING SYSTEM IT NEEDS LOOKED AT 
DOES IT FALL ON THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS HOUSE OR IS IT SHARED OR WHATEVER 
SO ONLY A COUPLE OF MINOR THINGS BUT YOU WANT TO CHECK THAT YOU'RE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT HUNKY DORY WITH THAT 
I HAD A PRIVATE WORD WITH OUR SURVEYOR WHEN YOU FIRST LOOKED AT THIS PROPERTY AND THE OTHERS 
SPACE KEPT CROPPING UP YEAH THAT'S RIGHT O. K. 
LIVING ACCOMMODATION OR BEDROOMS THE LIVING ACCOMMODATION IS FINE THE MASTER BEDROOM ISN'T TOO MASTER 
THE OTHER TWO BEDROOMS ARE GOOD BUT NOT GREAT 
SO YOUR MUM WOULD WANT A BIT MORE SPACE FOR HER BEDROOM I THINK SO 
I HAD A WORD ABOUT THIS YOU RAISED THE ISSUE OF GOING INTO THE LOFT AND DOING A CONVERSION 
IT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA BUT THIS HAS GOT MODERN TRUSSES WHICH ARE VERY HARD TO CONVERT 
IT CAN BECOME QUITE COSTLY ALSO THE SHAPE OF THIS ROOF DOESN'T LEND ITSELF WELL TO A CONVERSION 
BUT WHAT HE DID SUGGEST IS OVER THAT PART THERE AND OVER THE GARAGE YOU COULD GO UP A STOREY THERE 
SO YOU COULD BUILD ALMOST AN ANNEXE FOR YOUR MUM SO SHE COULD GET AWAY FROM ALL THE SONS 
AND HAVE HER OWN MASTER GRAND BEDROOM YES A SUITE FOR HERSELF 
WHAT WE SHOULD DO NOW IS LET YOU DO THE TEST DRIVE SPEND SOME TIME WITH IT AND HAVE SOME DELIBERATION THEN 
FAIR ENOUGH RIGHT O. K. 
THE GATES OPEN AND THE FAMILY FLOODS IN DEBBIE'S SISTER AND HER MUM 
EVERYBODY'S WELCOME TO COME AND HELP DEBBIE MAKE HER MIND UP 
CHAMPAGNE AND CANAPES MY KIND OF ROAD TEST 
SO FAR SO GOOD BUT WHAT DOES DEBBIE'S SISTER THINK 
IT'S ONLY A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN WHAT YOU'VE GOT NOW 
MUM CAN YOU GET TO THE KETTLE O. K. YES CAN YOU MAKE A CUP OF TEA 
YES THAT'S O. K. THEN 
IT'S A VERY COSY HOUSE IT IS VERY COSY H. OU S. E. 
MUM SEEMS PLEASED AND SO DOES EVIS WHO'S OFF TO CHECK OUT THE KITCHEN 
BUT THE DOWNSTAIRS WAS NEVER A PROBLEM FOR DEBBIE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT THE BEDROOMS 
WHAT DO THE BOYS THINK THIS IS YOUR ROOM IS IT O. K. 
OH THIS IS NICE 
DEBBIE AND HER FAMILY HAVE GIVEN THE HOUSE A THOROUGH ROAD TEST AND GOT AN IDEA ABOUT LIVING HERE 
THE FAMILY ARE IMPRESSED SO WILL THEY PUT AN OFFER IN 
WELL IT'S BEEN A CRAZY JOURNEY YOU'VE DONE YOUR TEST DRIVE 
WAS THERE LOTS OF SPACE IN THE HOUSE THERE IS ENOUGH SPACE 
BUT I'M THINKING ABOUT EXTENDING THE BEDROOMS ALEC VERY KEEN 
I'D LIKE TO GET DOORS ON THAT CAR PORT GOOD POINT 
EXTRA SPACE A BIT MORE SECURE AND FIND OUT ABOUT EXTENDING IT I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SO POSITIVE 
A FIRST O. K. THAT LEAVES ONE BIG QUESTION ARE YOU GOING TO BARTER OR ARE YOU GOING TO SCARPER 
I THINK WE NEED TO GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT IT'S JUST IN THE BALANCE 
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE WILL SO IT COULD BE YES COULD BE NO IT COULD BE IT COULD BE 
VERY GOOD WHATEVER HAPPENS LET US KNOW WE'VE GOT TO DISAPPEAR 
WE'VE LEAVE YOU TO SPEND SOME MORE TIME HERE DEAL DEAL LET'S GO 
I WISH IT WAS JUST HIM DISAPPEARING 
KRIS HANGING IN THE BALANCE THE SCALES COULD TIP EITHER WAY 
MY EQUILIBRIUM IS ALL OF A QUIVER IS IT YEAH SEE A DOCTOR I WILL 
PENICILLIN THAT'LL HELP IT'LL CLEAR IT UP I HOPE SO 
IF YOU'RE FEELING OFF KILTER ABOUT HOUSE HUNTING GET IN TOUCH 
AND WE'LL COME ROUND TO HELP FIND YOUR DREAM HOME 
I CAN'T REMEMBER MY NEXT LINE
