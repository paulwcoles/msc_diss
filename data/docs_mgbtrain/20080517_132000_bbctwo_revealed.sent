THAT'S HOW IT SEEMS IF YOU READ THE PAPERS GO ONLINE 
YOU KNOW THE STORIES 
THE ONES ABOUT BINGE DRINKING HOODIES ASBOS GANGS 
BUT IS THAT REALLY YOUR LIFE 
SURELY IT'S JUST THE ACTIONS OF A FEW AFFECTING 
THE WAY EVERYONE ELSE THINKS ABOUT YOU WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON 
ARE YOU WORSE THAN YOUR PARENTS' GENERATION 
REVEALED IS HERE TO FIND OUT WHY DO THEY HATE YOU 
I'M ANTHONY I'M CHARLOTTE WE'RE BOTH JOURNALISTS 
AND THIS IS THE FIRST PROGRAMME WE'VE PRESENTED TOGETHER 
IT'S CALLED REVEALED 
WE'RE NOT LIKE OTHER NEWS PROGRAMMES THAT TALK ABOUT YOU 
BUT NOT TO YOU WE WANT TO HEAR YOUR STORIES 
AND LOOK AT THE HEADLINES FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW 
ENOUGH CHAT HERE'S WHAT'S COMING UP 
WE'RE NOT ACCUSING ANY OF THEM OF ANYTHING 
THEY'RE IN THE AREA THEY'RE A GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE 
WHAT WOULD YOU NORMALLY DO ON A FRIDAY NIGHT 
GET DRUNK GET DRUNK 
PEOPLE THINK WE'RE BAD BECAUSE WE'VE GOT HOODS BUT I AIN'T THAT BAD 
I'M A NICE LAD 
BEEN ARRESTED BEFORE NOPE HOW ABOUT YOU YEAH 
THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH VIOLENT CRIME IN SOME AREAS INEVITABLY 
THAT'S WHAT THE MEDIA PICKS UP ON 
IT'S QUITE UNFAIR TO BLAME IT ALL ON YOUNG PEOPLE 
TEENAGERS IN THE U. K. ARE MORE HATED THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN EUROPE 
AND THERE'S RESEARCH OUT THERE TO PROVE IT 
MORE THAN FIFTEEN MILLION BRITISH ADULTS SAID THEY THOUGHT ABOUT MOVING HOUSE 
JUST GO GET AWAY FROM YOU HANGING AROUND IN THEIR AREA 
JUST HANGING AROUND NOT TRYING TO BREAK IN OR SMASH UP THE BUS STOP 
JUST SPENDING TIME OUTSIDE WITH YOUR MATES 
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THERE AREN'T SOME OF YOU WHO ARE UP TO NO GOOD 
THEY HATE US WE ALL GET DRUNK 
THEY THINK WE'RE COMPLETELY ANNOYING PEOPLE 
YEAH YOU'RE TREATED O. K. 
MOST PEOPLE HAVE QUITE A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS TEENAGERS 
THEY HAVE THE VIEW THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO CAUSE TROUBLE 
CLARE'S SEVENTEEN AND LIVES NEAR BELFAST 
SHE TOLD US ABOUT A PLACE WHERE SHE USED TO HANG OUT 
SO THIS IS THE PARK 
THIS IS THE PARK WE SPENT MOST OF OUR SUMMER IN FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS 
BUT WE TURNED UP ONE DAY LAST SUMMER AND THERE WAS A PADLOCK ON THE GATES WHY HAVE THEY LOCKED IT UP 
THEY DECIDED THAT WE WEREN'T WELCOME BASICALLY 
THEY FIGURED THAT WE WERE CAUSING TROUBLE AND DRINKING 
AND BEING ANTI SOCIAL AND WERE YOU DRINKING 
NO LIKE TWELVE O'CLOCK DURING THE SUMMER 
IN THE CENTRAL TOWN PARK I DON'T THINK EVEN IF WE WANTED TO WE COULD 
WERE YOU EVER A BIT ROWDY A BIT TOO NOISY MAYBE 
NOT US WE SUNBATHED ALL DAY 
IT WAS GOOD WEATHER A GROUP OF TWENTY IS QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE 
COULD YOU SEE WHY SOMEONE WALKING THROUGH ON THEIR OWN MIGHT BE INTIMIDATED BY THEM 
YEAH I UNDERSTAND BUT I THINK IT'S UNFAIR TO BLAME IT ALL ON YOUNG PEOPLE 
IF IT WAS A GROUP OF ADULTS AND A YOUNG PERSON WAS WALKING THROUGH IT WOULD BE THE SAME 
BUT THE ADULTS WOULDN'T BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE OWNERS OF THE PARK 
SAID THEY HAD GOOD REASON TO LOCK THE GATE 
TORQUAY A SMALL TOWN ON THE SOUTH COAST OF ENGLAND 
THERE'S A NICE LITTLE HARBOUR YOU CAN SEND YOUR GRANNY A POSTCARD 
AND GET SOME GREAT FISH AND CHIPS 
BUT THERE CAN BE A BIT OF TROUBLE HERE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT AND SOMETIMES IT INVOLVES TEENAGERS 
WE WANT TO SEE IF THE CALLS THE POLICE GET HERE ARE ANYTHING LIKE HEADLINES 
SO I'M OFF FOR A NIGHT ON THE BEAT 
I'M WALKING TOWARDS TORQUAY BY NIGHT TO SEE IF I CAN FIND ANYONE UP FOR A CHAT 
IT'S NINE THIRTY P. M. WE'VE BEEN WALKING AROUND WE'VE COME TO BREWERY PARK 
IN TORQUAY AND WE'RE TOLD THAT LOTS OF TEENAGERS COME HERE TO HANG OUT 
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S NO ONE HERE AT THE MOMENT 
IT'S NOT SURPRISING IT'S JUST LASHED IT DOWN WITH RAIN 
WHILE ANT WAS GETTING SOAKED 
I WAS GETTING A RIDE IN A POLICE VAN WITH OFFICERS NIKKI AND CHRIS 
LAST YEAR I WAS OUT WITH MY SERGEANT IN A MARKED PATROL CAR 
AND WE WERE BEING STONED BY A GROUP OF THIRTY KIDS 
TEENAGERS I SUPPOSE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS WE PHYSICALLY COULDN'T GET OUT THE CAR 
AND THEY WERE RUNNING UP AND DOWN A LANE SO NO MATTER WHICH WAY WE DROVE THEY'D RUN THE OPPOSITE WAY 
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENING YEAH UNBELIEVABLE 
DO YOU EVER GET THE FEELING THERE'S A PARTY GOING ON 
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE UNINVITED 
BLIMEY OH WOW SO BUSY 
THERE'S ABOUT FIFTY YOUNG PEOPLE CHEERED AS THE POLICE VAN ARRIVED 
WHAT ARE YOU ALL DOING DOWN HERE JUST TRYING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME 
BUT YET AGAIN WE CAN'T YOU'RE BEING QUITE NOISY WE'VE HAD A FEW CALLS 
THERE'S A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE DOWN HERE MORE THAN ABOUT SIXTY 
EVERYONE'S QUITE ROWDY 
WA HEY 
GUYS CLEAR OFF SORRY 
IT'S NOT FUNNY IT'S NOT FAIR 
AFTER A GOOD HALF AN HOUR NIKKI AND CHRIS MANAGE TO MOVE EVERYONE ON 
BUT THEY RECKON THIS WON'T BE THE LAST WE SEE OF THE PARTY TONIGHT 
HELLO HI IT'S ME HI CHARLOTTE 
JUST GOT BACK FROM DOWN BY THE BEACH 
ABOUT SIXTY TEENAGERS DOWN THERE SIXTY 
YEAH ABSOLUTELY LOADS THAT WILL EXPLAIN WHY I'M SAT HERE ALL ON MY OWN 
MY NIGHT STARTED TO LIVEN UP AND I GOT TO HEAR ABOUT THE BEACH PARTY 
WHY DO YOU GO DOWN THERE COS THERE'S NOTHING TO DO IN TORQUAY 
WHY DO THE POLICE MOVE YOU ON I DUNNO 
WHAT DO YOU RECKON PEOPLE MAKE OF A MASSIVE GROUP OF TEENAGERS 
I'VE HEARD THERE WERE SIXTY OF YOU DOWN THERE THAT'S GONNA SCARE SOME PEOPLE THEY JUST THINK WE'RE YOBS 
BUT WHEN WE LEAVE AS SOON AS WE GET TO THE TOP OF THE HILL EVERYONE JUST SEPARATES UP 
PEOPLE THINK WE'RE BAD COS WE'VE GOT HOODS BUT WE AIN'T THAT BAD 
I'M A NICE LAD THIS LOT WERE A BIT SHY ABOUT BEING ON CAMERA 
WHAT WOULD YOU NORMALLY DO ON A FRIDAY NIGHT GET DRUNK 
IS THAT IT YEAH 
WHY THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO DO IS THERE 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN A CALL CAME IN 
SOMEONE'S BEEN ASSAULTED UP THE ROAD WHY HAVE YOU MADE THEM STAND THERE 
BECAUSE THE MAN WHO'S BEEN ASSAULTED WAS ASSAULTED BY A LARGE GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE 
WE'RE NOT ACCUSING ANY OF THESE GUYS AT THIS POINT BUT THEY'RE A GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE AREA 
BACK AT THE STATION IT WAS TIME TO ASK NIKKI AND CHRIS ABOUT WHAT WE'D SEEN THAT NIGHT 
THE FEW THAT WE DEAL WITH IT'S TIRING 
IT'S HARD WORK WHEN YOU'RE BEING FOUGHT AGAINST ALL THE TIME 
THE FEAR OF CRIME IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN THE REALITY OF CRIME COMMITTED 
IT'S THE SAME WITH BINGE DRINKING 
EVERYONE REALLY DOES GO OUT AND BINGE DRINK 
THERE'S A TOWN FULL OF ADULTS DOWN THERE GETTING LASHED 
BUT NO ONE'S REALLY WRITING ABOUT THEM COS THEY'RE DOING IT IN A PUB OR A CLUB 
THE KIDS ARE ON THE BEACH AT THE START OF THE NIGHT WE SPOKE TO A GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE AT A BUS STOP 
I WANTED TO KNOW IF THEY'D HAVE DONE THE SAME THING IF IT WAS A GROUP OF ADULTS' 
IT ALL DEPENDS 
NIKKI LATER TOLD US THAT TWO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS WERE ARRESTED THAT NIGHT 
IT'S BEEN A COLD WET NIGHT 
I'VE BOOKED A TAXI AND I'M GOING BACK TO THE HOTEL 
EIGHT HOURS LATER BACK ON A BEACH 
BUT THIS TIME TO THROW SOME STONES AND HAVE A QUICK CATCH UP 
NIKKI AND CHRIS PULLED THIS ONE GROUP OVER 
AND IT WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT MOST OF THEM HAD DEFINITELY NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN A FIGHT 
THEY WEREN'T PUMPED UP AND EXCITED LIKE YOU WOULD BE AFTER A FIGHT 
AND I REALLY GOT THE FEELING FROM THEM THAT THEY WERE QUITE ANNOYED 
AT HAVING BEEN PULLED OVER AGAIN BY THE POLICE 
AND THEY'RE LIKE EVERY TIME WE'RE OUT PAST TEN O'CLOCK WITH MORE THAN THREE FRIENDS WE GET PULLED OVER 
DID YOU EVER FEEL THREATENED BY THE TEENAGERS YOU SPOKE TO 
NOT AT ALL 
THERE WAS THREE LADS AND THEY FELT IT WAS SO UNFAIR COS THEY'D GONE TO THE BEACH 
TO GET AWAY FROM THE AREAS WHERE THEY'D BE DISTURBING PEOPLE 
THEY'D GONE THERE COS THEY KNEW THERE'D BE NOBODY AROUND 
TORQUAY WAS ONLY ONE NIGHT IN ONE TOWN 
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BIGGER PICTURE WORKING OUT HOW BAD YOUTH CRIME IS 
ISN'T EASY SO WE'RE GOING TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE WHO CAN MAKE SENSE OF IT 
THE AMOUNT OF CRIME HERE IS ALMOST TWICE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE 
WELCOME TO MIDDLESBROUGH DOCTOR MARK SIMPSON MAY HAVE SOME ANSWERS 
HE'S A CRIME EXPERT WHO WORKS HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEESIDE 
SO WHEN IT COMES TO CRIME AND TEENAGERS 
ARE THINGS WORSE THAN BEFORE 
MAYBE NOT IN TERMS OF THE STATISTICS 
THEY SHOW THAT CRIME IS FALLING 
QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS 
CERTAINLY THAT'S THE CASE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE 
BUT IN THIS NEWSPAPER A TYPICAL HEADLINE IS 
YOUTH CRIME SHOOTS UP BY TWO THIRDS IN TEN YEARS 
THAT SUGGESTS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID 
YES WE LIKE TO READ ABOUT THESE THINGS THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF TRUTH OF COURSE 
IF YOU LOOK AT STATISTICS ACROSS THE BOARD THE BRITISH CRIME SURVEY FOR EXAMPLE 
THAT SUGGESTS THAT VIOLENT CRIME IS STABLE 
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WITH VIOLENT CRIME IN SOME AREAS 
AND THAT'S WHAT THE MEDIA PICKS UP ON YOU CAN ALWAYS THROUGHOUT HISTORY TALK ABOUT A GOLDEN ERA 
AND IT'S ALWAYS TWENTY YEARS AGO THINGS WERE BETTER 
EVEN MARK SAYS THE FIGURES ARE COMPLICATED 
BUT THE OVERALL MESSAGE IS THAT CRIME IS DOWN 
BUT PEOPLE THINK THAT THERE'S MORE OF IT GOING ON THAN THERE ACTUALLY IS IN ENGLAND AND WALES 
THE NUMBER OF TEENAGERS COMMITTING CRIMES IS EXTREMELY LOW THREE PER CENT 
POLICE IN NORTHERN IRELAND TOLD US THEY DON'T HAVE THESE FIGURES 
AND IN SCOTLAND THE SYSTEM IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BUT THE FIGURES ARE ABOUT THE SAME 
SO WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER NINETY SEVEN PER CENT OF YOU 
OR TO PUT IT THE OTHER WAY THE OTHER FORTY FIVE MILLION OF YOU WHO AREN'T GETTING INTO TROUBLE 
JUST HANGING ABOUT REALLY GOING TO TOWN OR THE BEACH 
THERE'S NOT MUCH TO DO ROUND HERE WE'RE ON OUR COUNCIL ESTATES ALL DAY JUST SITTING THERE 
AND BY PEOPLE IN THEIR HOUSES BECAUSE WE'RE SITTING THERE 
I'VE GOT A LOT OF SPARE TIME ON MY HANDS COS I'VE GOT EXAMS COMING UP 
SHOPPING HORSE RIDING GOING OUT WITH FRIENDS 
CHLOE AND EMMA LOVE SHOPPING 
BAGS CLOTHES JEWELLERY AND THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR PASSION FOR FASHION TO GOOD USE 
TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING AT THE MOMENT 
WE'RE ORGANISING A CHARITY FASHION SHOW THIS SUMMER 
WHAT DOES THAT INVOLVE 
IT INVOLVES PICKING UP PEOPLE FOR MODELLING 
AND ASKING LOCAL BUSINESSES TO GET INVOLVED 
WE'RE BOTH REALLY INTERESTED IN FASHION I STUDY GRAPHICS AND EMMA STUDIES TEXTILES 
SO WE WANT TO FOLLOW THAT CAREER PATH IT'S GOOD WORK EXPERIENCE AND IT'LL LOOK GOOD ON OUR C. V. 
SOME MIGHT SAY THAT'S QUITE SELFISH MOTIVES I SUPPOSE IT IS 
COS IT WILL HELP YOU IN YOUR CAREER BUT IT'S ALSO RAISING MONEY FOR LOCAL CHARITIES 
SO IT CAN'T BE SELFISH IF IT LEADS TO SOMETHING GOOD 
VOLUNTEERING DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN RAISING CASH FOR CHARITY 
JOE'S SIXTEEN AND LIFE'S ALL ABOUT FOOTBALL WHEN HE'S NOT PLAYING IT 
HE COACHES IT HE'S BEEN HELPING OUT AT ROSS JUNIORS FOR OVER A YEAR 
BEFORE THE COACHING WHAT SORT OF THING WOULD YOU GET UP TO 
MAINLY PLAYSTATION OR WATCHING THE TELLY 
NOT MUCH MAINLY BORING BUT SINCE I'VE BEEN DOING THIS 
IT'S A LOT MORE FUN WHY DID YOU FANCY DOING IT 
BECAUSE I LIKE THE BOYS WINNING MATCHES 
WHEN THEY WIN DO YOU FEEL PROUD FOR THEM 
IF I SEE THEM DO SOMETHING WHICH WE TRAINED ON IT FEELS GOOD 
COS YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAD PART TO DO WITH IT I FEEL PROUD COS I'VE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP 
BELFAST MIDDLESBROUGH PRESTON 
TORQUAY ROSS ON WYE IT'S BEEN A LONG JOURNEY IT CERTAINLY HAS 
WHEN WE SET OUT WE WANTED TO CHALLENGE THE IMAGE OF TEENAGERS IN THE HEADLINES ARE YOU THAT BAD 
THE CRIME FIGURES SUGGEST NOT BUT IT GOES FURTHER THAN THAT 
YOU ARE MORE LIKELY THAN ANY OTHER AGE GROUP IN THE U. K. TO DO VOLUNTEER WORK 
YOU'RE TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE A VOLUNTEER THAN A CRIMINAL BUT THAT'S NOT SUCH A GOOD HEADLINE 
FOR A LOOK AT WHAT'S COMING UP NEXT WEEK CHECK OUT THE WEBSITE 
B. B. C. DOT CO DOT U. K. SLASH SWITCH 
THERE'S A MURDER A MYSTERY AND AGATHA CHRISTIE 
THE THRILL IS IN THE CHASE NEVER IN THE CAPTURE 
THERE'S NOWHERE TO RUN 
IF ANYONE CAN SOLVE THIS IT'S YOU
