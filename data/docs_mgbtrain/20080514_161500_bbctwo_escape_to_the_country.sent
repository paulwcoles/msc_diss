IT'S NOT JUST THE BRICKS AND MORTAR THAT NEED TO IMPRESS TODAY'S HOUSE HUNTERS 
THIS IS BRISTOL ENGLAND'S CAPITAL OF THE SOUTH WEST 
OUTSIDE OF LONDON IT HAS THE SECOND STRONGEST ECONOMY IN ENGLAND 
AND IS STEEPED IN HISTORY AND THE ARTS TO BOOT 
THIS SHIP THE S. S. GREAT BRITAIN WAS THE ENGINEERING MASTERPIECE OF ITS DAY 
CREATED HERE IN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY THREE BY ISAMBARD KINGDOM BRUNEL 
NOT ONLY WAS IT THE LARGEST SHIP OF ITS TIME 
IT WAS ALSO THE FIRST TO BE POWERED BY STEAM AND SCREW PROPELLER 
AND NOW IT MAKES A RATHER STUNNING CENTREPIECE TO BRISTOL'S DOCK 
WITH THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION CAME THE CREATION OF AFFLUENT SUBURBS SUCH AS CLIFTON 
THE AVERAGE PRICE FOR A DETACHED PROPERTY HERE RIVALS LONDON'S 
AT A STAGGERING FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND 
AND JUST LIKE THE CAPITAL BRISTOL ALSO HAS A RICH ARTISTIC HERITAGE 
CARY GRANT WAS BORN HERE 
AS WAS THE SOUND OF TRIP HOP FROM BANDS LIKE MASSIVE ATTACK AND PORTISHEAD 
AND IT'S THE MIX OF CLASSICAL AND CONTEMPORARY 
THAT ATTRACTS NINE MILLION VISITORS HERE EVERY YEAR 
IN SEARCH OF ITS TRENDY BARS AND HISTORIC NEIGHBOURHOODS 
THIS THEATRE THE BRISTOL OLD VIC IS THE LONGEST WORKING THEATRE IN THE U. K. 
AND THE STAGE HAS BEEN GRACED BY THE LIKES OF MIRANDA RICHARDSON JEREMY IRONS AND DANIEL DAY LEWIS 
ALL OF WHICH IS GOOD NEWS FOR THE CITY'S BUSTLING ECONOMY 
BUT NOT FOR THOSE LONGING FOR SOMEWHERE A BIT QUIETER AND LESS HECTIC 
LIKE MATT STANLEY AND RACHAEL CLARIDGE 
HE'S TWENTY EIGHT AND WORKS AS A SOLUTIONS BUSINESS MANAGER 
HIS GIRLFRIEND RACHAEL'S A TWENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD ADOPTION MARKETING OFFICER 
BUT THERE'S A THIRD MEMBER OF THIS RELATIONSHIP 
AND DISTANCE MEANS THEY ONLY MEET AT WEEKENDS 
COME FRIDAY IT'S A THREE HUNDRED FORTY MILE ROUND TRIP 
TO VISIT PRINCE MELIODAS RACHAEL'S ARABIAN STALLION 
RACHAEL IS A CHAMPION LONG DISTANCE HORSE RIDER 
IN THIS COUNTRY I HAVE WON A RACE AT CIRENCESTER PARK WHICH IS A NATIONAL EVENT 
AND I ALSO COMPETED IN THE WORLD ENDURANCE CHAMPIONSHIPS IN DUBAI LAST YEAR 
I WORK ALONGSIDE RACHAEL AS PART OF THE CREW DURING RACES 
WHICH LOOKS AFTER THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE HORSE AND RIDER 
BEFORE I MET RACHAEL I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ENDURANCE 
BUT SINCE THEN I HAVE BECOME A BIT OF AN EXPERT AND WE REALLY LOVE IT 
FINDING THE RIGHT PROPERTY IN THE COUNTRY WITH LAND NEARBY 
WOULD ALLOW ME TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH THE HORSES AND LESS TIME IN THE CAR 
YES WELL DONE RACH 
MATT AND RACHAEL LOVE NOTHING MORE THAN A PARTY ROUND AT THEIR HOUSE 
AND IT WOULDN'T BE THE SAME WITHOUT OLD MATES CHERYL AND PAUL 
NOT FORGETTING PETE AND MIRANDA 
YES COME ON 
WE'RE REALLY GOING TO MISS THESE GUYS BECAUSE WE HAVE THEM ROUND ALL THE TIME 
THAT IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THE SPARE ROOM 
SO WE CAN HAVE THEM ROUND TO STAY 
MATT BOUGHT THIS THREE BEDROOMED IN THE BRENTRY AREA OF BRISTOL 
FOR NINETY FIVE THOUSAND FOUR YEARS AGO 
HE AND RACHAEL WANT THE OPTION OF EITHER LETTING OR SELLING IT 
SO I HAVE CALLED IN AN ESTATE AGENT AND A LETTING AGENT TO GIVE ME AN IDEA OF WHAT THEY WOULD GET 
THE FRONT DOOR LEADS STRAIGHT INTO A SPACIOUS LIVING ROOM 
THIS LEADS INTO A GOOD SIZED KITCHEN DINER WITH ACCESS TO A BACK GARDEN 
IT'S A LOVELY HOUSE CLOSE TO THE HOSPITAL 
WHICH WOULD MAKE IT A PERFECT RENTAL PROPERTY FOR A COUPLE OR A FAMILY 
BACK THROUGH THE LIVING AREA AND UP THE STAIRS 
IS THE MAIN BATHROOM COMPLETE WITH A WHITE THREE PIECE SUITE 
TO THE LEFT OF THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
THREE BEDROOM HOUSES HERE SELL VERY QUICKLY AND ARE IN HIGH DEMAND 
THIS IS A PARTICULARLY NICE PROPERTY 
A FEW STEPS ALONG THE CORRIDOR AND WE FIND A SECOND BEDROOM 
THEN LASTLY A THIRD SMALLER ROOM CURRENTLY BEING USED AS A STUDY 
MATT AND RACHAEL FIRST THINGS FIRST 
YOU HAVE NEVER HAD THIS PROPERTY VALUED SINCE YOU BOUGHT IT 
I HAVE HAD TWO VALUATIONS DONE ONE FOR LETTING AND ONE FOR SALE 
RENTALS THEY RECKON YOU COULD GET BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY AND SIX HUNDRED PER CALENDAR MONTH 
AND IF YOU SOLD IT YOU COULD GET BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND AND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND 
GOSH WOW 
YEAH I TAKE IT THAT'S A GOOD REACTION YEAH A LITTLE MORE THAN WE THOUGHT I THINK 
RACHAEL WHAT'S THE BUDGET FOR THE BIG MOVE 
IT'S TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND IF WE RENT THIS PROPERTY AND WE'RE UP TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SIXTY 
IF WE ACTUALLY SELL THIS PROPERTY AND INVEST IN SOMETHING THAT'S GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED 
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO ESCAPE TO 
IDEALLY TO SOMERSET SO THAT WE CAN BOTH CARRY ON WORKING IN BRISTOL AND WESTON SUPER MARE 
FOR TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND WHAT ARE THE ESSENTIALS YOU WOULD NEED TO HAVE IN THAT PROPERTY 
WE WOULD NEED A MINIMUM OF TWO BEDROOMS 
THE REASON PRIMARILY FOR THE RURAL LOCATION IS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES THE FACILITIES FOR US 
IN TERMS OF RIDING A PLACE WHERE WE CAN TRAIN THE HORSES AND ANY OTHER ESSENTIALS 
SOMEWHERE THAT'S GOT DECENT PARKING AS WELL 
BECAUSE WE'VE BOTH GOT TWO CARS BETWEEN US FOR OUR JOBS AND FOR THE HORSES 
IF I WAS TO PERSUADE YOU TO SELL THIS PROPERTY AND GO TO THE BIGGER BUDGET OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTY 
WHAT WOULD THE PROPERTY NEED TO COME WITH 
IF WE WERE TO FIND A PLACE THAT TICKED ALL THE BOXES 
IN TERMS OF IT HAD LAND WITH IT WHERE WE COULD KEEP THE HORSES 
POSSIBLY A BARN OR STABLES WHERE THEY COULD LIVE AND THAT WAS NEARBY 
THE RIDING AROUND THERE WAS VERY VERY GOOD THAT WOULD CONVINCE US TO LOOK AT EXTENDING OUR BUDGET 
YOU STAY LOGGED ON TO THE LAPTOP AND YOU CAN GET AN IDEA OF WHAT I'M FINDING 
WE'LL KEEP IN CONTACT SO THAT YOU CAN KEEP ME IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL FIND THE PROPERTY OF YOUR DREAMS AT THE RIGHT BUDGET 
BRILLIANT SUPERB THANK YOU 
MATT AND RACHAEL HAVE GIVEN ME TWO BUDGETS ONE IF THEY CHOOSE TO LET THE HOUSE 
AND ONE IF THEY DECIDE TO SELL IT 
EVEN AT THEIR HIGHER BUDGET OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND FINDING A COUNTRY HOME 
FOR TWO ADULTS TWO HORSES AND ALL WITHIN COMMUTING DISTANCE OF BRISTOL 
IS GOING TO BE A TRICKY TASK 
SO MY COUPLE ARE LOOKING FOR A TWO BEDROOMED CHARACTER PROPERTY 
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY NEED NEARBY ACCOMMODATION FOR THEIR HORSES 
BONUSES WOULD INCLUDE THREE BEDROOMS AND LAND ATTACHED TO THE PROPERTY 
SOMERSET IS ONE OF THE OLDEST INHABITED COUNTIES IN ENGLAND 
SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT IT'S STEEPED IN HISTORY AND MYTHOLOGICAL TALES 
BUT THE LEGEND OF KING ARTHUR AND HIS QUEST FOR THE HOLY GRAIL 
ISN'T THE ONLY THING IT'S FAMOUS FOR 
SOMERSET'S WORLDWIDE REPUTATION FOR CIDER AND CHEESE ALSO DRAWS IN THE CROWDS 
AND FUELS ONE OF THE COUNTY'S BOOMING INDUSTRIES TOURISM 
WITH SO MUCH OPEN COUNTRYSIDE SOMERSET'S TOPOGRAPHY HAS BARELY CHANGED IN RECENT YEARS 
AND IS MADE UP OF A SERIES OF PICTURESQUE VILLAGES AND SMALL MARKET TOWNS 
BUT IT'S NOT GREAT NEWS FOR BUDGET BUYERS LIKE MATT AND RACHAEL 
THE AVERAGE PRICE FOR A DETACHED PROPERTY IN SOMERSET 
IS JUST BELOW TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND 
MATT AND RACHAEL HAVE GIVEN ME TWO BUDGETS BASED ON WHETHER THEY SELL OR RENT THEIR BRISTOL HOUSE 
MY FIRST SEARCH IS BASED ON THE HIGHER FIGURE OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND 
AND I'VE ALREADY FOUND A HOUSE WITH LAND IN THE VILLAGE OF CROSCOMBE JUST FOUR MILES EAST OF WELLS 
LAVENDER COTTAGE IS A TWO BEDROOM HOUSE WITH PLENTY OF PERIOD FEATURES 
ON SALE FOR JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
BACK IN BRISTOL MATT AND RACHAEL ARE KEEPING TRACK OF MY PROGRESS VIA THE LAPTOP 
LOOKS LIKE IT'S QUITE A QUIET LITTLE VILLAGE 
WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR YEP 
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL I'VE ALSO MANAGED TO FIND FIFTEEN ACRES OF GRAZING LAND FOR THE HORSES 
IN THE NEARBY HAMLET OF DEAN A TEN MINUTE DRIVE FROM LAVENDER COTTAGE 
THE LAND IS ON THE MARKET FOR FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE ACCESS TO THE FIELD IS RIGHT ONTO THE ROAD 
IT JUST DEPENDS HOW BUSY THE ROAD IS AND AT WHAT TIME OF THE DAY IT'S BUSY 
TOGETHER THE LAND AND LAVENDER COTTAGE WOULD COST TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
HELLO THERE 
NOW WHAT AN IMPACT THIS ROOM HAS 
FANTASTIC ISN'T IT FAR MORE THAN YOU WOULD IMAGINE FROM THE OUTSIDE 
IT'S QUITE SORT OF COTTAGEY ISN'T IT QUITE AN INTERESTING SPIRAL STAIRCASE THERE 
THIS IS A COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED SPACE 
YOU'VE GOT THE DINING TABLE OVER HERE AND THE SEATING AREA HERE WHICH IS NICE IT IS A NICE ROOM 
IT WORKS REALLY WELL VERY SOCIABLE AND GOOD FOR ENTERTAINING 
THE DOWNSTAIRS LOOKS A LOT BIGGER THAN IT DID ON FIRST IMPRESSIONS 
I'M IMAGINING THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN KNOCKED ABOUT 
WE THINK ORIGINALLY IT WAS TWO COTTAGES 
I LIKE THE FACT THAT WHOEVER'S DONE IT HAS KEPT SOME OF WHAT I IMAGINE ARE ORIGINAL DETAILS 
I'M SURE THEY ARE ORIGINAL DETAILS YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE GARGOYLE IS IT HAS BEEN CUT OUT 
THAT IS PART OF A SHIP'S FRAMEWORK 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE GARGOYLES IN THE FRONT ROOM I WAS ABOUT TO SAY THAT 
AND I'VE GOT MY BACK HERE TO THIS THIS LOVELY FIREPLACE WITH 
IS THIS A WOOD BURNER IT'S A WOOD BURNER 
THAT IS A LOVELY WOOD BURNER AND IT LOOKS LIKE A REAL ONE 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'D LIKE IT CERTAINLY ADDS TO THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE PLACE 
SOME REALLY NICE FEATURES IN HERE AND LOADS OF SPACE 
WHICH JUST MOVES ME ON TO OUTSIDE NO PARKING SPACE 
NO THIS IS AN OLD COTTAGE YOU CAN'T PARK OUTSIDE 
YOU CAN PARK JUST ROUND THE CORNER 
THAT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM IT WILL BE A PROBLEM 
LET'S CARRY ON WE HAVE GOT SOME RATHER LOVELY STONE STEPS UP HERE 
TO THE BATHROOM DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM 
A VERY TINY DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM 
YEAH IT IS TINY BUT THIS IS AN OLD COTTAGE 
BACK OUT I WILL COME BACK TO THOSE STAIRS IN A MOMENT 
WHERE TO NEXT NOW TO THE KITCHEN 
O. K. SORT OF GOING BACK NOW 
TO THE BACK OF THE HOUSE 
IT'S ALL SORT OF FUNNY ANGLES 
THAT LOOKS REALLY NICE IT DOES ACTUALLY YEAH 
THAT'S QUITE SURPRISING IT'S GOT A LOVELY OLD FASHIONED SINK 
YOU COME OUT OF THE KITCHEN RIGHT AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE 
AND THERE'S A SORT OF OUTDOOR LEAN TO AREA WHICH IS GREAT EXTRA STORAGE 
IT WOULD BE THE PERFECT PLACE FOR MATT TO STORE HIS MOUNTAIN BIKE 
AND THINGS LIKE LADDERS THAT YOU WANT TO KEEP OUT OF THE HOUSE 
I SUPPOSE IF ALL THE RIDING GEAR DOESN'T ACTUALLY GO OUT INTO THAT OUTSIDE ROOM 
WE COULD PUT OUR GARDENING THINGS OUT THERE AS WELL YEAH 
THIS IS A FAIRLY GOOD SIZED STORAGE CUPBOARD 
SO EQUALLY THAT COULD BE A GOOD HOME FOR ALL RACHAEL'S RIDING TACK 
AND THEN UP WE COME TO THE GARDEN AND I FEEL A LITTLE BIT LIKE I'M IN FLORENCE OR SOMEWHERE 
THAT'S A REALLY NARROW GARDEN 
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE IT QUITE LIKE THAT TO BE HONEST 
IT IS ADMITTEDLY RATHER A STRANGE SHAPE BUT I RATHER LIKE IT 
IT'S QUITE QUIRKY LIKE THE HOUSE 
LONG AND POINTED GOING TO THE SMALLEST GARDEN SHED I'VE EVER SEEN AT THE FAR END 
IT'S FAIRLY LOW MAINTENANCE AND I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S GOT REAL CHARACTER 
PERFECT PLACE TO SIT AT THE END OF A HARD DAY'S RIDING 
SHE CAN SIT HERE WITH HER GLASS OF WINE LOOK OUT OVER THE OPEN FIELDS 
AND INSTEAD OF HEARING SIRENS BLARING AWAY SHE CAN LISTEN TO THE SOUND OF THE CHURCH BELLS 
THAT DOES SOUND QUITE APPEALING SOUNDS VERY APPEALING DEFINITELY 
THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE OBVIOUSLY ISN'T AN ORIGINAL FEATURE 
IT DOES GIVE YOU MORE SPACE DOWNSTAIRS OF COURSE 
BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER TO PLAN WHAT FURNITURE YOU WANT UPSTAIRS RATHER CAREFULLY 
THERE ARE TWO BEDROOMS HERE THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE MAIN ROOM 
PLENTY OF SPACE FOR A DECENT DOUBLE BED AND OTHER BITS OF FURNITURE 
BEHIND THE CURTAIN HERE IS A REALLY GOOD STORAGE CUPBOARD 
ACROSS THE HALLWAY IS BEDROOM NUMBER TWO 
THIS IS ADMITTEDLY A SLIGHTLY LESS PRACTICAL SHAPE SORT OF GOING ROUND THE CORNER THERE 
IT IS QUITE A QUIRKY SPACE BUT WE COULD POTENTIALLY USE HALF OF IT 
AS AN OFFICE FOR YOU SO THAT YOU COULD WORK FROM HOME 
WITH THE TWO BEDROOMED LAVENDER COTTAGE ON THE MARKET 
FOR JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THE LAND ON FOR FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
MATT AND RACHAEL WOULD HAVE TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TO BUILD A STABLE BLOCK 
THAT WOULD MEAN SELLING THE HOUSE IN BRISTOL 
TO MEET THEIR TOP BUDGET OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND 
IT IS A VERY NICE LOOKING PROPERTY 
IT'S WELL DONE 
MY MAIN CONCERN IS THE PARKING AND THE GARDEN YEAH 
I'VE TRAVELLED THIRTY TWO MILES SOUTH WEST TO THE PICTURESQUE VILLAGE OF TRULL 
WHICH IS WEST OF TAUNTON AND INCLUDES A POPULAR LOCAL PUB AND GOOD PRIMARY SCHOOL 
EASTBROOK TERRACE IS ON THE MARKET FOR JUST UNDER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
AND I'VE HEARD THERE'S LAND FOR SALE NEARBY WHICH MIGHT BE SUITABLE FOR RACHAEL'S HORSES 
THE SURROUNDING COUNTRYSIDE LOOKS O. K. 
BUT FIRST THE HOME OWNER PHILIPPA IS GOING TO SHOW ME AROUND 
HELLO PHILIPPA HELLO THERE 
NICE TO SEE YOU HERE WE ARE IN YOUR LITTLE TERRACED COTTAGE 
LOOKS QUITE SMALL ACTUALLY FROM THE INITIAL VIEW 
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW IT PANS OUT INSIDE 
THIS IS YOUR FRONT GARDEN SO THERE'S NO OFF STREET PARKING HERE IS THERE 
NO WE PARK ALONG THE ROAD 
TO BE HONEST IT'S NEVER BEEN A PROBLEM TO PARK 
THERE'S QUITE A GOOD PARKING BAY ACROSS THE ROAD ABSOLUTELY 
LOVELY OLD DOOR IS IT ORIGINAL 
I DON'T KNOW I ASSUME SO 
IT DOES HAVE A REAL FEELING OF PERIOD CHARACTER WHICH IS LOVELY 
IT'S GOT A NICE FEEL TO IT ACTUALLY HASN'T IT IT HAS THE BEAMS AND AND THE WOOD BURNER THERE YEAH 
SO THIS IS YOUR BIGGISH OPEN PLAN LIVING SPACE 
IS THIS THE ONLY LIVING ACCOMMODATION 
THIS IS THE FRONT ROOM AND DINING AREA RIGHT ENTERTAINING IS QUITE A BIG THING 
YOU CAN PULL THAT OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND WE'VE MANAGED TO SIT LOTS OF PEOPLE AROUND 
WE'RE COMING INTO THE KITCHEN I'M GOING UP A STEP 
I'M FIVE F. T. SIX AND I'M QUITE CLOSE TO THE CEILING 
MATT IS SIX F. T. FIVE D'YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO BE BENDING A LITTLE BIT 
POSSIBLY MY HUSBAND IS SIX F. T. TWO AND HE MANAGES TO MOVE AROUND HERE QUITE WELL 
DOES HE RIGHT I THINK I'D HAVE A SORE NECK IN THERE 
HOW PRACTICAL DO YOU FIND IT 
REASONABLE ACTUALLY WE'VE GOT ENOUGH WORK SURFACE HERE AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL 
THE KITCHEN LOOKS WELL DONE ALL LOOKS FAIRLY MODERN 
AND QUITE WELL PRESENTED DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THERE'S ANY WORK TO DO 
NO NOT AT ALL 
RIGHT CARRYING ON BACK THROUGH THE COTTAGE WHAT'S THROUGH HERE 
RIGHT SO THROUGH TO THE BATHROOM 
A DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM HOW DO YOU FIND THAT 
ABSOLUTELY FINE WE DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT AT ALL 
THE WAY THE BATHROOM IS DECORATED ALL VERY CLEAN AND TIDY 
IT'D BE A SHAME REALLY TO HAVE TO BREAK IT ALL UP TO PUT A SHOWER IN 
BECAUSE IT IS DONE QUITE NICE BUT 
THERE'S A LITTLE UTILITY AREA BY THE BACK DOOR WHICH IS VERY USEFUL FOR MUDDY BOOTS 
A LITTLE LUCKY HORSESHOE MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD SIGN 
FOR QUITE A SMALL HOUSE THERE'S QUITE A DECENT GARDEN HERE 
THAT'S A REASONABLE SIZE 
YES AND IT'S NICE THAT YOU GO FROM THE BACK DOOR STRAIGHT OUT INTO THE BACK GARDEN 
THERE'S SIDE ACCESS WHICH COMES WITH A REALLY GOOD WIDE GATE 
AND AT THE BACK THERE'S A REALLY DECENT SIZED GARDEN SHED 
WHICH WOULD BE PERFECT AS A TACK ROOM FOR RACHAEL 
WE CAN ACTUALLY GO INTO THE HOUSE THE BACK WAY AND DROP THE BOOTS OFF 
AND NOT GET THE REST OF THE HOUSE COVERED IN MUD 
LOVELY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTIES LUMPY WALLS HERE WHICH IS QUITE A NICE FEATURE 
TWO BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS 
THIS IS THE FIRST WHICH IS OPTIMISTICALLY TERMED A DOUBLE BEDROOM 
I THINK OPTIMISTIC IS THE WORD 
BUT THAT WOULD BE FINE IF WE WANTED TO PUT A FOLD DOWN BED IN THERE 
AND OBVIOUSLY SPACE IF I WANTED TO PUT THE OFFICE IN AND DO SOME WORK FROM THERE 
AND THIS IS THE MAIN BEDROOM 
IT IS A FAIRLY DECENT SIZE 
ONE THING TO POINT OUT IT'S GOT REALLY HIGH CEILINGS 
SO AT THIS POINT IN THE HOUSE MATT COULD UNCRICK HIS NECK WHEN HE COMES TO BED 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE REAL CONTRAST THE BLACK EXPOSED BEAMS 
THE HORSES' ACCOMMODATION IS ON FARMLAND SITUATED IN THE VILLAGE OF DUDDLESTONE 
THIS LAND IS LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES' DRIVE FROM THE HOUSE 
THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN ACRES SO ALL READY TO GO FOR RACHAEL'S HORSES 
BEST OF ALL THERE'S A STABLE BLOCK ALREADY EXISTING 
YOU'VE GOT THREE STALLS PLUS A HAY STALL AT THE FAR END 
SO IT'S BASICALLY JUST THE ASKING PRICE OF FORTY FIVE THOUSAND 
AT THE FAR SIDE OF THE PROPERTY YOU'VE GOT A RUNNING STREAM AND BEYOND THAT THE M. FIVE 
SO A LITTLE BIT NOISY BUT I DON'T THINK THE HORSES WILL MIND 
THE FACT THAT IT IS ONLY FIVE MINUTES' DRIVE AWAY IS EXCELLENT 
FOR SECURITY REASONS AS WELL AS TRYING TO GET THERE BEFORE WORK DEFINITELY 
STILL TO COME ON ESCAPE TO THE COUNTRY MATT AND RACHAEL 
ARE RATHER TAKEN WITH ONE OF MY CHARACTERFUL COTTAGES 
THIS IS GOOD THIS IS DEFINITELY TICKING A LOT OF BOXES 
AND WHICH HOME FOR THE HORSES WILL COME OUT ON TOP 
SMART LIVERY ISN'T IT IT IS 
IT'S LOVELY IT LOOKS LIKE A RACING YARD IT DOES 
IT'S DAY TWO OF MY SEARCH AND ALREADY I MAY HAVE FOUND SOMETHING TO SUIT IN LANGPORT 
APPARENTLY LANGPORT IS ENGLAND'S SMALLEST TOWN 
THERE'S LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST IT WAS ONCE A BUSTLING TEXTILES AND COAL TRADING POST 
INSTEAD I'M SURROUNDED BY COUNTRYSIDE 
AND FIFTY MILES OF FOOTPATHS WHICH SHOULD KEEP MATT AND RACHAEL BUSY 
MY NEXT PROPERTY IS CONVENIENTLY LOCATED NEAR A RANGE OF SHOPS 
INCLUDING A BUTCHER'S AND FISHMONGER'S 
AND IT'S A STONE'S THROW FROM THE KIND OF SLEEPY LANES 
YOU'D FIND IN SOME OF THE MORE REMOTE VILLAGES 
THREE WESTOVER IS A THREE BEDROOM VICTORIAN HOUSE 
ON THE MARKET FOR JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
WELL WITHIN MATT AND RACHAEL'S TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND BUDGET 
THAT LOOKS NICE MM H. M. M. 
I'VE ALSO MANAGED TO FIND A LIVERY WITHIN FOUR MILES 
OF MY THIRD PROPERTY IN SOMERTON 
WHICH MEANS MATT AND RACHAEL COULD HOLD ONTO THEIR HOUSE IN BRISTOL 
COURT EQUESTRIAN IS A WELL ESTABLISHED LIVERY 
WITH TWENTY TWO GOOD SIZED STABLES ON SITE 
LOOKS A VERY SMART LIVERY 
IT IS IT'S LOVELY IT LOOKS LIKE A RACING YARD IT DOES 
HAVING CHECKED OUT THE STABLES I'M NOW OFF TO LANGPORT TO SEE THE HOUSE 
HELLO HELLO 
HI MICHAEL NICE TO SEE YOU 
ON THE DETAILS IT SAYS THIS HOUSE HAS BEEN CONTEMPORISED 
IT DOES FEEL VERY MODERN INSIDE 
HOW OLD IS IT AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
LOOKING AT IT FROM THAT ANGLE IT LOOKS A LITTLE STERILE AND LITTLE TOO CLEAN ALMOST MM H. M. M. 
THEN IT FLOWS THROUGH INTO AN OPEN PLAN KITCHEN AGAIN IT ALL LOOKS VERY NEW 
CERTAINLY THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM HEIGHT WISE FOR YOU 
DEFINITELY THERE'S A LOT OF WORK SPACE AS WELL 
WHEN WE'RE GOING TO BE ENTERTAINING WE CAN HOPEFULLY DO SOME GOURMET COOKING 
I QUITE LIKE THIS KITCHEN 
IT'S VERY LONG AND THIN A BIT LIKE BEING ON A TRAIN ISN'T IT SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
I SUPPOSE IT'S PRACTICAL IT'S GOT ALL ITS BITS AND PIECES THAT YOU NEED ALL IN A ROW 
WHAT'S THROUGH THE DOOR AT THE FAR END THAT'S WHERE THE GARDEN IS 
THE GARDEN'S TO THE SIDE ON THIS PROPERTY LET'S GO THROUGH HERE NEXT 
SO THIS IS THE SITTING ROOM YES 
QUITE A SMALL SITTING ROOM BUT IF YOU'VE GOT THE DINING AREA AS WELL 
IT'S A BONUS REALLY WE CAN ENTERTAIN IN ONE ROOM AND RELAX IN THE OTHER 
I WOULD SAY THAT THIS GARDEN IS PRETTY MUCH THE DEFINITION 
OF A LOW MAINTENANCE GARDEN WHICH IS WHAT MATT AND RACHAEL ASKED ME FOR 
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO HINT OF GRASS FLOWERBEDS OR ANYTHING PARTICULARLY GARDEN Y. 
CERTAINLY THE SORT OF PLACE WE COULD HAVE THE FRIENDS ROUND AS WELL FOR BARBECUES 
WE'D PUT THE LAWN DOWN AND GET THE BARBIE IN THERE AND THAT WOULD BE FINE 
IT'S A SLIGHTLY FUNNY SHAPE BECAUSE THE CURRENT OWNERS HAVE TAKEN A CHUNK OUT OF IT 
TO MAKE A CAR PARKING SPACE ON THE OTHER SIDE 
THERE'D BE ENOUGH SPACE FOR THE TWO CARS 
COMING UPSTAIRS THE FIRST ROOM YOU GET TO IS THE BATHROOM WHICH IS ONE 
OF THE AREAS THAT THE CURRENT OWNERS HAVE MADE OVER RECENTLY 
WOW THEY CERTAINLY HAVE MADE THAT OVER HAVEN'T THEY DEFINITELY 
ACROSS THE CORRIDOR WE COME TO THE FIRST OF THE BEDROOMS 
THIS IS A PRETTY IMPRACTICAL SHAPE 
THERE IS A CHUNK MISSING BECAUSE OF THE STAIRCASE 
THAT LOOKS TINY YEAH 
AND THEN NEXT DOOR BEDROOM NUMBER TWO WOULD BE THE GUEST ROOM 
SO THERE'S ENOUGH ROOM FOR A DOUBLE BED OR A FOLD DOWN BED IN THERE 
NEXT DOOR ALSO AT THE FRONT OF THE PROPERTY IS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
AGAIN I'M PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY THE SPACE IN HERE GIVEN THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A COTTAGE 
THAT'S A NICE ROOM MM HMM FIRST IMPRESSION REASONABLE SIZE 
THE BIG BONUS WITH THIS HOUSE IS THAT IT DOES HAVE THREE BEDROOMS 
THREE BEDROOMS DEFINITE BONUS 
DEFINITELY YOU CAN WORK FROM HOME AND HAVE YOUR OWN SPACE 
MY THIRD PROPERTY IS PRICED AT JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
IT BOASTS THREE BEDROOMS AND A LARGE BATHROOM 
WITH THE ADDED BONUS OF OFF STREET PARKING 
FOR MY FINAL PROPERTY I'VE COME TO EASTON 
A VILLAGE TWO MILES NORTH WEST OF WELLS CITY 
MUFFINS MUDDLE IS A DETACHED COTTAGE ON THE MARKET FOR JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
NICE DETAIL ON THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
THE REAL PLUS HERE IS THAT THERE IS A WELL RESPECTED LIVERY YARD 
JUST ONE MILE AWAY WHICH I'M GOING TO VISIT LATER 
SO IN WE COME A LARGE FENCE 
TO BAR YOU FROM THE ROAD SLIGHTLY 
IT GIVES YOU THAT SEGREGATION 
BETWEEN THE ROAD AND THE ACTUAL FRONT GARDEN 
WHAT ABOUT PARKING DAN WHERE DO YOU PARK 
WELL PARKING'S A SMALL ISSUE 
THERE'S PARKING SLIGHTLY FURTHER UP THE ROAD 
THAT COULD BE DIFFICULT YEAH 
SO YOU WALK STRAIGHT INTO THE PROPERTY BASICALLY NO HALLWAY YES 
D'YOU KNOW HOW OLD THE PROPERTY IS IT'S APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
YEAH A NICE BIG SIZE AREA THERE 
A NICE FIREPLACE AT THE END 
LET'S CARRY ON THROUGH 
RIGHT OOH GOSH A DINING ROOM 
YES CERTAINLY ENOUGH SPACE FOR ENTERTAINING IN HERE 
YES YOU COULD GET A GOOD SIZE TABLE ACTUALLY COULDN'T YOU 
AGAIN NICE TO HAVE A SEPARATE ROOM FOR THE ENTERTAINING AND THE DINING ROOM 
SO THIS IS PART OF THE EXTENSION TO THE ORIGINAL MUFFINS' COTTAGE 
IT IS YEAH I HAVE TO SAY IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A MUDDLE 
PARTS OF THE HOUSE THIS ROOM PRETTY MUCH JUST NEEDS A LICK OF PAINT 
BUT THE KITCHEN I WOULD SAY IS A BIT OF A HORROR 
IT LOOKS LIKE A NEW KITCHEN WOULD BE IN ORDER 
YEAH IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A PROBLEM ALTHOUGH IT IS QUITE SMALL AND NARROW AND COMPACT 
YOU'D HAVE TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT HOW YOU WERE GOING TO LAY IT OUT 
SO THIS IS THE UTILITY ROOM I READ ABOUT THIS ON THE DETAILS 
THE UTILITY ROOM IS BIGGER THAN THE KITCHEN 
IT'S A GOOD SPACE AND LOTS OF POTENTIAL HERE AS WELL 
OBVIOUSLY STORAGE AS WELL WHICH IS GREAT 
THE FACT THAT THERE'S THE OUTSIDE SINK THERE AND THE WASHING MACHINE FOR DOING ALL THE HORSEY STUFF 
SO OUT INTO THE GARDEN WHICH IS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE 
IT'S DEFINITELY A PATIO GARDEN 
FAIRLY TINY BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THE COTTAGE HAS BEEN SO EXTENDED OVER THE YEARS 
AGAIN NO GRASS BUT ALWAYS THE OPTION TO PUT THAT IN MM HMM 
A REALLY GOOD ADVANTAGE IS THAT THERE IS A SIDE ACCESS AROUND THE SIDE OF THE COTTAGE SO YOU DON'T 
HAVE TO BE BRINGING YOUR TACK OR ANYTHING YOU WANT TO STORE THROUGH THE HOUSE THAT'S GOOD 
THAT IS A REALLY GOOD PLUS 
COMING UPSTAIRS A FAIR FEW ROLLS OF WOODCHIP PAPER HAVE BEEN PUT TO GOOD USE IN THIS COTTAGE 
AS LONG AS WE COULD GET IT OFF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM TO RECTIFY 
BEDROOM NUMBER ONE IS AT THE FRONT OF THE PROPERTY SO THE OLDER PART OF THE COTTAGE 
THAT'S GOT NICE FLOORING AND IF IT'S THE GUEST ROOM IT'LL BE ABSOLUTELY FINE 
THEN NEXT DOOR IS WHAT'S BEING USED AS THE MAIN BEDROOM 
AGAIN WE'RE AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
SO IN THE OLDER PART BUT YOU ARE OVERLOOKING THE ROAD HERE 
IT'S A GOOD SIZE 
IF IT'S AT THE FRONT OF THE PROPERTY AS A GUEST ROOM THE NOISE WOULDN'T BE SO MUCH OF AN ISSUE 
AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE OVER THE EXTENSION THAT WAS DONE IN THE MUDDLEMENT OF THE HOUSE 
THIS IS BEDROOM THREE A BIG BONUS 
MATT COULD USE THIS EXCLUSIVELY AS A STUDY 
IT'S A GOOD SIZE FOR A THIRD BEDROOM AS WELL 
ACROSS THE WAY IS THE BATHROOM 
GOOD TO HAVE AN UPSTAIRS BATHROOM 
THE ONLY THING THAT MATT WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER IS THAT HE'LL HAVE TO STAND ON THIS SIDE 
OF THE ROOM ONLY BECAUSE THERE'S NOT SO MUCH HEAD CLEARANCE THERE 
THEN AGAIN IT'S QUITE HANDY WHEN YOU'RE REPAINTING THE CEILING 
HAVING LAID OUT MY REDECORATION PLANS IN THE HOUSE I'M GOING TO HEAD OFF AND LOOK AT THE LIVERY 
I THINK WITH A BIT OF DECORATING HERE AND THERE 
THE LIVERY AT REDMOND BOTTOM FARM OPENED IN THE AUTUMN LAST YEAR 
AND THE OWNER ANNA CLAIRE SEYMOUR IS GOING TO SHOW ME AROUND 
HELLO ANNA CLAIRE NICE TO SEE YOU I'VE JUST COME UP FROM THE VILLAGE TO HAVE A LOOK AROUND THE LIVERY 
MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION FIRST HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO HAVE A HORSE HERE 
WE CHARGE TWENTY FIVE A WEEK 
FOR THE BASIC DIY LIVERY DO IT YOURSELF 
AND THEN WE MAKE CHARGES ON TOP OF THAT FOR HAY AND STRAW 
O. K. SO THAT'S A COST TO CONSIDER BUT AGAIN IT'S OFFSET BY THE TRAVELLING 
WE DO AT THE MOMENT WHICH IS QUITE COSTLY SO WE NEED TO CONSIDER THAT 
WHAT SORT OF SPACE DO THE HORSES GET 
EACH OF THE STABLES IS LIKE THIS THEY HAVE TWELVE BY FIFTEEN F. T. IN THE STABLE 
WE HAVE AN OUTDOOR ARENA SIXTY BY TWENTY METRES 
OF PROFESSIONAL FIBRE SAND SURFACE SO IT'S MORE OR LESS ALL WEATHER 
THE FACILITIES LOOK PRETTY GOOD THERE AND THERE WAS A LOT OF SPACE WITHIN THAT BARN 
THE AMERICAN STYLE BARNS ARE GOOD YEAH 
I'M GOING TO HAVE A REALLY GOOD MOOCH AROUND SO I'LL LET YOU GET ON WITH YOUR SWEEPING OUT THANK YOU 
NOW THEY'VE SEEN MY FOUR HOUSES MATT AND RACHAEL NEED TO MAKE UP 
THEIR MIND WHICH TWO THEY'D LIKE TO VIEW FOR THEMSELVES 
MY FIRST PROPERTY LAVENDER COTTAGE IN CROSCOMBE 
IS ON SALE FOR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND IS PACKED WITH PERIOD FEATURES 
BUT LAND FOR THE HORSES ISN'T CHEAP AT FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND THEY WOULD NEED 
TO BUILD STABLES MAKING THIS OPTION THE MOST EXPENSIVE 
SIXTEEN EASTBROOK TERRACE IS PRICED AT JUST UNDER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
THE LEAST EXPENSIVE OF MY FOUR PROPERTIES 
FOR FORTY FIVE THOUSAND MY COUPLE COULD BUY A PADDOCK FOR THEIR HORSES 
WHICH ALREADY HAS STABLES AND WATER FACILITIES 
THIS OPTION IS BEST FOR THE HORSES 
BUT WILL THERE BE ENOUGH LIVING SPACE FOR MATT AND RACHAEL 
IN TERMS OF SPACIOUSNESS ONE WESTOVER IN LANGPORT COMES OUT ON TOP 
AT A GREAT PRICE OF JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
AND WITH THE ALL IMPORTANT LIVERY NEARBY AND A PARKING BAY 
I FEEL THIS ONE IS THEIR BEST BET 
BUT WILL THE LACK OF PERIOD FEATURES PUT MATT AND RACHAEL OFF 
MUFFINS MUDDLE IN EASTON COSTS JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
FOR THAT YOU GET BAGS OF CHARM HIGH CEILINGS AND THREE BEDROOMS 
THAT'S NOT FORGETTING THE SMART LIVERY JUST A MILE AWAY 
THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THAT THE COTTAGE SITS ON A BUSY A ROAD 
WITH NO PARKING 
BEFORE MATT AND RACHAEL MAKE ANY DECISIONS THERE'S STILL MY MYSTERY HOUSE TO THINK ABOUT 
I THINK IT COULD BE PERFECT FOR THEM 
ON THE MARKET FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND IT'S A THREE BEDROOM STONE COTTAGE WHICH EVEN HAS AN INGLENOOK FIREPLACE 
WHAT'S MORE THERE'S LAND FOR SALE WITHIN ONE MINUTE'S WALKING DISTANCE 
BUT THE TOTAL COST OF THE LAND AND THE PROPERTY 
WOULD BE AROUND TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND 
WHICH WOULD MEAN SELLING THEIR HOUSE IN BRISTOL 
THAT SOUNDS QUITE INTERESTING MM HMM 
YEAH IT MIGHT BE WORTH A LOOK 
YEAH CERTAINLY WORTH CONSIDERING 
SHALL WE HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE GOT YEAH 
THIS WAS LAVENDER COTTAGE 
MAIN PROBLEM WITH THIS ONE WAS INITIALLY THE PARKING 
REALLY QUITE WORRIED ABOUT THAT 
IT WAS A LOVELY VILLAGE BUT I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE PRACTICAL FOR OUR NEEDS I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT 
O. K. I THINK THAT PROBABLY DRAWS THAT ONE TO A CONCLUSION 
OUR NEXT ONE WAS EASTBROOK TERRACE IN TRULL 
IT'S NOT BAD BUT I THINK IT'S A BIT SMALL 
THAT LAND THAT COULD BE PURCHASED NEARBY WAS PRETTY GOOD FOR THE PRICE RANGE AND WE'D CERTAINLY BE WITHIN 
OUR BUDGET TO HANG ON TO THE PROPERTY IN BRISTOL AS WELL 
I JUST WONDER IF IT IS JUST TOO SMALL 
I THINK IT PROBABLY IS YEAH O. K. 
PUT THAT ONE TO THE SIDE NOW WE HAD THE DETACHED ONE IN LANGPORT 
I REALLY LIKED THE LOOK OF THIS THE FACT IT'S DETACHED IS A REAL PLUS 
IT HAD THREE BEDROOMS AS WELL CATHERINE MENTIONED IT'S A LOT OF HOUSE FOR THE MONEY 
I AGREE WITH THAT I'M REALLY QUITE INTERESTED IN THIS ONE 
LET'S PUT THAT ONE TO THAT SIDE O. K. 
FINALLY WE'VE GOT MUFFINS MUDDLE 
THE BIGGEST DRAWBACK WITH IT IS THE MAIN ROAD THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
AND THE LACK OF PARKING 
WITH THAT IN MIND WE'VE GOT THE MYSTERY HOUSE AS WELL WHICH I WAS QUITE INTRIGUED BY 
I THINK PROBABLY THE BEST OPTION IS TO TRY THE MYSTERY HOUSE 
SO WE'VE GOT 
THE PROPERTY IN LANGPORT WHICH SEEMS QUITE INTERESTING 
WE'RE INTRIGUED BY THE MYSTERY HOUSE YEAH ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT THAT'S FINE 
TODAY MATT AND RACHAEL ARE OFF TO SEE THEIR FIRST PROPERTY 
ONE WESTOVER IN LANGPORT 
BUT BEFORE THEY CHECK THE HOUSE OUT I'VE SENT THEM OFF TO VIEW THE LOCAL LIVERY COURT EQUESTRIAN 
THIS IS NICE 
THIS IS GOOD 
IT'S A GOOD SIZED BOX YEAH IT'S ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS WHAT THEY'VE GOT CURRENTLY 
THEY'LL BE QUITE HAPPY WITH THAT IT'S GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY YEAH 
YEAH THIS ONE WAS 
JUST UNDER TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FOR THE YEAR 
FOR THE TWO HORSES 
AND WITH THE USE OF THE MENAGE AND THE TACK ROOM AND THINGS AS WELL 
YEAH THAT'S GOOD FACILITIES IT'S NICE 
INTERIOR LIGHTING FOR THE WINTER THIS WALL PROVIDES OF PROTECTION FOR THEM 
I THINK THE BOYS WOULD BE HAPPY HERE I THINK THEY WOULD 
HELLO HI 
HERE WE ARE AT PROPERTY NUMBER ONE 
WHAT ABOUT THE LOCATION FIRST OF ALL 
IT'S NOT QUITE AS RURAL AS WE WERE EXPECTING 
BUT IT MIGHT BE WORKABLE DEPENDING ON WHAT'S IN THE SURROUNDING AREA THAT'S YOUR CAR PARKING SPACE 
THIS BELONGS TO THE PROPERTY YOU'D PROBABLY GET THE TRUCK ON THERE 
YES CERTAINLY HERE'S THE HOUSE ITSELF MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL 
WHAT ARE YOUR IMPRESSIONS FROM THE OUTSIDE 
FROM THE SIZE OF THE HOUSES WE'VE LOOKED AT THIS LOOKS QUITE BIG 
LET'S GET INSIDE AND HAVE A LOOK AROUND FOLLOW ME IN WE COME 
IT'S BIGGER THAN I EXPECTED 
WOW YEAH IT'S NOT TOO COTTAGEY 
NO IT'S IT'S YEAH A VERY SORT OF MODERN 
PRESENTATION FOR IT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE FEEL OF IT 
HAS IT GOT ENOUGH CHARACTER FOR YOU 
IT'S NOT TOO BAD I NOTICE THE VENT IN THE WALL THERE 
THERE'S POTENTIAL TO PUT A FIREPLACE BACK IN THERE 
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE OLD CHIMNEY BREAST 
I WONDER IF IN THIS AREA 
WE MIGHT CONSIDER PUTTING CARPET DOWN 
JUST TO SOFTEN THE FEEL OF THE ROOM POSSIBLY 
THEY'VE GONE FOR A VERY CONTEMPORARY LOOK 
ALMOST LIKE LOFT LIVING IN LANGPORT 
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY'RE USING THIS AS A DINING ROOM 
AND IT THEN RUNS INTO THE KITCHEN 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE KITCHEN IT'S A LOVELY KITCHEN 
IT'S BEEN DONE VERY NICELY 
THERE SEEMS TO BE LOTS OF SPACE FOR PREPARING FOR MEALS 
OBVIOUSLY IT'S LONG AND THIN 
BUT NOT BAD WIDTH IT'S NOT LIKE A GALLEY KITCHEN 
NO IT ISN'T DOWN THIS FAR END THIS IS YOUR DOOR OUT TO THE GARDEN 
THAT'S NICE IT'D BE AN EXCELLENT SPACE WHEN WE HAVE FRIENDS ROUND AND HAVE BARBECUES 
WE COULD HAVE A BIGGER SORT OF EXTENDED KITCHEN EXACTLY 
IT ACTUALLY WORKS REALLY WELL 
THROUGH HERE THIS IS WHERE THEY'VE STARTED THEIR COSY CARPETING AREA 
THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE USING AS A SITTING ROOM 
IT'S A NICE SIZE ACTUALLY 
IT LOOKED QUITE SMALL FROM THE PICTURES THAT WE SAW 
I THINK IT'S QUITE A NICE SIZE TO HAVE FOR A LOUNGE 
OUR SUITE WOULD CERTAINLY FIT IN HERE AS WELL WHICH IS GOOD 
AGAIN I SEE THE VENT THERE TO HAVE A FIREPLACE IN THE LOUNGE WOULD BE A NICE THING 
THERE'S THE POSSIBILITY FOR THAT IN HERE EXCELLENT THAT IS EVERYTHING DOWNSTAIRS 
I'M GOING TO LET YOU EXPLORE ON YOUR OWN AND WE'LL GET TOGETHER LATER 
THANK YOU O. K. 
THIS IS NICE OH YEAH 
IT'S CERTAINLY BIGGER THAN WE WERE HOPING 
WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO ANY WORK IN HERE AT ALL I DON'T THINK 
NO THERE'S A SHOWER AS WELL WHICH IS GOOD 
THE SINKS ARE TINY THEY ARE AREN'T THEY 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT WE COULD BOTH COME IN HERE CERTAINLY NO ARGUMENTS OVER THE SINKS 
IT'S THE RIGHT HEIGHT FOR YOU 
THAT'S A GOOD SIZE THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH ROOM HERE FOR OUR WARDROBE 
YEAH THERE WOULD BE NOT SURE ABOUT THE VIEW THOUGH 
IT WOULD BE NICE TO LOOK OUT OF THE BEDROOM WINDOW AND SEE THAT RURAL ENVIRONMENT WE'RE LOOKING FOR 
HELLO 
SO YOU'VE SEEN THE WHOLE PLACE WHAT DO YOU THINK 
IT'S A NICE SIZED HOUSE IT'S REALLY DONE OUT WELL INSIDE 
RACHAEL HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT IT 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF PLACES TO ENTERTAIN WITH IN THE HOUSE AND THE KITCHEN IS A FANTASTIC SIZE 
THE OUTSIDE WITH THE PARKING AND GARDEN THERE'S A BIT OF WORK TO BE DONE BUT WE'LL WAIT AND SEE 
NOW'S THE BIG GAMBLE TIME BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING THE MYSTERY HOUSE NEXT 
LET'S HEAD OFF AND HAVE A LOOK AT THAT SUPERB 
MY MYSTERY PROPERTY IS SITUATED JUST OUTSIDE THE ANCIENT PARISH OF WINCANTON 
IN THE LATE SIXTEEN HUNDREDS THE TOWN WAS A STAGE ON THE LONDON PLYMOUTH ROUTE 
MANY COACHING INNS WERE ESTABLISHED 
NOWADAYS IT HAS PLENTY OF AMENITIES INCLUDING A COUPLE 
OF COUNTRY PUBS WHICH I'M SURE MATT AND RACHAEL WILL LOVE 
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR FRIENDS TO STAY 
NO ONE LEE FARM IS AN END OF TERRACE STONE COTTAGE 
IT'S ON THE MARKET FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
AND COMES WITH THREE BEDROOMS AND A FAMILY BATHROOM 
IT ALSO HAS A SMALL LOW MAINTENANCE GARDEN 
BUT BEFORE I TROT RACHAEL AND MATT OFF TO SEE LEE FARM 
I WANT TO SHOW THEM THE LAND AND THE REAL BONUS IS THAT IT'S WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF THE COTTAGE 
RIGHT THE PLOT OF LAND IS JUST OVER THIS HEDGE 
IT'S SIXTY THREE ACRES 
IT HAS GOT RUNNING WATER FOR THE HORSES 
IT'S UP FOR AUCTION AND THE GUIDE PRICE IS TWENTY TWO THOUSAND 
AS YOU CAN SEE THERE ISN'T A STABLE 
BUT TO BUILD A DOUBLE STABLE WE'VE HAD A QUOTE OF TEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
THERE IT IS WHAT DO YOU THINK 
IT'S A GOOD SIZED FIELD 
JUST NEED TO SPOT EXACTLY WHERE THE BOUNDARIES ARE 
THE FACT THAT IT GOES STRAIGHT OUT ONTO A BRIDLEWAY 
WHICH TAKES YOU UP INTO THE FORESTRY IS EXCELLENT 
THAT'S THE LAND LET'S GET BACK AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE HOUSE O. K. 
RIGHT SO HERE WE ARE THE MYSTERY HOUSE 
THE MYSTERY IS OVER 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT FROM THE OUTSIDE IT'S LOVELY IT REALLY IS 
VERY COTTAGEY TO LOOK AT 
BRILLIANT LET'S GET INSIDE AND LOOK AROUND FOLLOW ME 
RIGHT IN YOU COME 
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT AS IT USED TO LOOK THEY RECKON IT'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD 
IT'S OBVIOUSLY AT SOME STAGE BEEN KNOCKED BACK TO CREATE THIS REALLY BIG LIVING SPACE 
IT'S NICE IT REALLY IS 
I REALLY LIKE THE BEAMS THE EXPOSED BEAMS ARE REALLY NICE 
IT'S AN INTERESTING AREA HERE WITH THE ER 
ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A LARGE FIREPLACE WAS IN THERE AT SOME POINT 
THIS WAS AN INGLENOOK A PROPER INGLENOOK FIREPLACE 
AT SOME STAGE SOMEBODY HAS EITHER TAKEN THE STONE OR THE BRICKS OUT 
OR MAYBE JUST COVERED THEM OVER 
IF YOU WERE FEELING REALLY FLUSH YOU COULD PUT AN INGLENOOK BACK IN 
LOOKING AROUND ARE YOU THINKING WE'D DO THIS WITH IT WE'D DO THAT WITH IT 
OR DO YOU LIKE IT PRETTY MUCH AS IT IS 
PRETTY MUCH AS IT IS I'D PROBABLY PAINT IT WHITE TO LIFT THE COLOUR IN HERE AND GET A BIT MORE LIGHT IN 
BUT I THINK YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY ALL I WOULD DO 
IT IS A REALLY GOOD ENTERTAINING SPACE 
YOU'VE GOT YOUR DINING SPACE THERE AND THEN YOU CAN STILL HAVE EVERYONE IN THE ROOM WITH YOU 
IT HAS GOT A SEPARATE KITCHEN WHICH IS A BIT OF A BONUS 
IT'S JUST ROUND THE CORNER IF YOU WANT TO GO IN AND HAVE A LOOK 
THIS IS A NICE SIZE 
IT'S A GOOD WORKABLE KITCHEN 
THE BEAMS IN HERE AS WELL I LIKE THAT IT'S A VERY PRACTICAL SIZE 
THE VIEW LOOKING DOWN ONTO THE DRIVEWAY IS NICE DOWN TO THE LANE THERE 
IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU GAVE ME SO MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT YOU NEEDED FOR THE HORSES OF COURSE 
I'VE NEVER REALLY HAD A HANDLE ON WHAT YOU REALLY LOVE ABOUT HOUSES 
IS THIS TICKING BOXES IT IS YES IT IS 
IT'S ALSO GOT THREE BEDROOMS BRILLIANT I'LL LET THE TWO OF YOU HAVE A LOOK AROUND UPSTAIRS 
AND WE'LL GET TOGETHER LATER AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK O. K. 
HERE'S A BATHROOM THEN 
THIS IS ALL RIGHT IT'S A REAL GOOD SIZE YEAH 
THERE'S THE SHOWER SO THE BATH AND SHOWER IN THE BATHROOM THAT'S GOOD 
IT'S ANOTHER BONUS REALLY 
YEAH OH WOW YOU'VE GOT THE BEAMS IN HERE AGAIN 
THAT'S REALLY NICE I QUITE LIKE THE FACT THAT 
THE THEME OF THE BEAMS THE CHARACTER RUNS THROUGH THE HOUSE 
THAT'S REALLY NICE IT'S A REALLY GOOD SPACE HERE FOR THE BED 
PLENTY OF ROOM I THINK OUR WARDROBE WOULD FIT IN THERE AS WELL IT WOULD DEFINITELY FIT IN THERE 
THIS IS GOOD THIS IS DEFINITELY TICKING A LOT OF BOXES 
MATT AND RACHAEL WE'VE COME TO THE END OF A HARD DAY'S PROPERTY HUNTING IT'S VERDICT TIME 
ARE YOU GOING TO BE MAKING AN OFFER ON EITHER OF THE PROPERTIES 
I DON'T THINK WE WILL BE 
THIS PARTICULAR PROPERTY WE WERE REALLY QUITE HAPPY AS WE WERE WALKING AROUND 
THREE NICE SIZED BEDROOMS LOTS OF SORT OF CHARACTER FEATURES 
THE ONE THING THAT REALLY DID LET IT DOWN IN SOME WAY WAS THE GARDEN 
WE'VE HAD TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU HAVEN'T GOT LOTS OF MONEY 
FOR ME THIS IS A GREAT AMOUNT OF SPACE IN TERMS OF THE PROPERTY 
AND I'D BE SURPRISED IF YOU COULD FIND THIS SIZE OF HOUSE IN THIS AREA WITH A BIG GARDEN AS WELL 
IT IS A LOVELY PROPERTY AND THE FACT THAT THE RIDING IS SO BRILLIANT AROUND THIS AREA 
AND TO HAVE THE THREE BEDROOMS AND ALL THE SPACE WITHIN THE LIVING SLASH DINING ROOM IS GREAT 
HOWEVER I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S QUITE RIGHT FOR US AT THIS MOMENT 
GOING FOR THIS OPTION WOULD'VE BEEN THE EXPENSIVE ONE BY THE TIME YOU'VE DONE THE HOUSE 
THE LAND AND BUILT THE STABLE IT WOULD'VE MEANT GIVING UP YOUR BRISTOL HOUSE AS RENTAL INVESTMENT 
HAS THAT AFFECTED YOUR DECISION AT ALL 
YEAH I THINK IT HAS KEEPING THE HOUSE IN BRISTOL WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE 
THE BEST THING THAT WE COULD DO IN TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT POTENTIAL 
HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR VIEWS ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SEARCHING FOR OVER THE COURSE OF OUR SEARCH TOGETHER 
HAVE YOU LEARNT ANYTHING I THINK WE HAVE WE'VE LEARNT THAT THERE ARE PROPERTIES OUT THERE 
WITHIN OUR BUDGET AND LAND THAT CAN BE BOUGHT IN A SEPARATE NEGOTIATION WITHIN OUR RENTAL BUDGET 
WE WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK IN YOUR SEARCHING 
I'D LIKE TO THINK OF YOU BEING REUNITED WITH YOUR HORSES AND NOT DOING THAT DRIVE EVERY WEEKEND 
DO KEEP ME POSTED ABOUT WHERE YOU END UP AND IF I'M EVER IN SOMERSET 
AND I WANT A LONG RIDE I'LL KNOW WHERE TO COME EXCELLENT THANK YOU 
MATT AND RACHAEL RECENTLY HAD AN OFFER ACCEPTED 
ON A TWO BEDROOMED COTTAGE IN KERSWELL 
A SMALL VILLAGE IN DEVON 
AND PRINCE MELIODAS WILL BE STAYING IN A NEARBY LIVERY 
WHICH IS GREAT NEWS
