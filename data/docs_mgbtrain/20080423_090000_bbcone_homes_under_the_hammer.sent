HERE IT IS 
HELLO NOW OVER THE YEARS LUCY AND I HAVE WITNESSED THE UPS AND DOWNS OF THE HOUSING MARKET 
WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN INVESTMENT OR A HOME WE WANT THE VALUE TO GO UP AND NOT DOWN 
AND IF YOU DO YOUR RESEARCH THEN ONE WAY TO MAYBE GUARANTEE THAT 
IS TO VISIT THE AUCTION WHERE YOU CAN BUY YOUR HOME UNDER THE HAMMER 
WE ALL READ ABOUT THE PROPERTY MARKET'S UPS AND DOWNS 
YES AND BUYING AT AUCTION IS A SIMPLE PROCESS 
YOUR HAND GOES UP THE HAMMER GOES DOWN YOU'VE BOUGHT THE PROPERTY 
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WHEN TODAY'S THREE PROPERTIES WERE SOLD 
IS THIS PROPERTY IN WALES REALLY AS BAD AS IT SEEMS 
OH NO 
THE SMELL IT'S JUST EUGH 
I THINK I'VE FOUND A LITTLE GEM IN WILLESDEN NORTH LONDON 
THIS IS WOW 
IT IS AMAZING IT'S SO EXCITING 
BUT IN LIVERPOOL SOMETHING'S NOT QUITE RIGHT WITH THIS HOUSE 
WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON HERE 
ALL THESE PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN SOLD AT AUCTION WE'LL FIND OUT 
WHO BOUGHT THEM AND WHAT THEY PAID FOR THEM WHEN THEY WENT UNDER THE HAMMER 
YOU KNOW THE RURAL LIFE IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE YEARN FOR 
HORSES CHICKENS OUTSIDE YOUR FRONT DOOR 
HERE I AM IN SOUTH WALES AND GOSH IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL WITH THESE KIND OF SURROUNDINGS 
PROPERTY PRICES ROUND HERE HAVE GOT TO BE ASTRONOMICAL 
NO THEY HAVEN'T 
AND I'M DELIGHTED TO SAY THAT THIS FABULOUS VIEW CAME FREE WITH THE HOUSE 
WHEN IT WENT TO AUCTION AT A BARGAIN PRICE 
JUST FIFTY NINE THOUSAND'S YOUR GUIDE FOR A THREE BEDROOM TERRACE 
WITH VIEWS LIKE THAT 
WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE LIKE INSIDE 
LET'S HAVE A LOOK 
OH NO 
THE SMELL IT'S JUST EUGH 
I'M ONLY KIDDING IT'S ACTUALLY A GREAT START 
REALLY NICE ENTRANCE FOYER AND IMMEDIATELY YOU GET THE FEELING THIS PLACE IS PRETTY TOGETHER 
THE FRONT ROOM THERE LOOKS LIKE IT'S HAD AN INTERESTING BIT OF DIY STUFF GOING ON AND YEP 
IT CONTINUES THROUGH HERE WITH A LAMINATE FLOORING THAT HAS NOT BEEN LAID CORRECTLY 
THAT'S FOR SURE BUT IT'S A GOOD SIZED SPACE 
FRONT ROOM REAR ROOM AND THEN SOMEBODY'S OBVIOUSLY MADE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF INTEGRATING 
WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY AN EXTENSION TO THE PROPERTY INTO THIS KITCHEN I LIKE THAT ENTRANCE THERE 
I GUESS THEY'VE TAKEN OUT WHAT WAS THE ORIGINAL WINDOW AT THE REAR 
TO CREATE THIS GOOD SPACE AND AGAIN IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THEY'RE HALFWAY THROUGH BASICALLY RENOVATING 
YOU'VE GOT A DOWNSTAIRS LOO HERE ENTRANCE OUT TO THE REAR GARDEN 
ALL IN ALL IT'S A GOOD PROPERTY 
THE FRONT ROOM IS SMALL BUT OPENING THE STAIRCASE UP 
AND INCORPORATING THE KITCHEN MAKES A GREAT SPACE AT THE REAR OF THE HOUSE 
DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM WELL WE'VE SEEN PLENTY OF THOSE BUT THERE'S A REAL SURPRISE AT THE BACK 
THIS IS A BIT OF A TURN UP FOR THE BOOKS 
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A LITTLE COURTYARD AT THE BACK THERE 
BUT IN FACT IT EXTENDS OUT INTO THIS REALLY LOVELY GARDEN 
IT'S VERY STEEPLY TERRACED BUT YOU KNOW WHAT 
HOW ABOUT THAT FOR A VIEW 
AND IT GETS EVEN BETTER THE HIGHER YOU CLIMB 
YES THE GARDEN IS A MESS BUT IT NEEDN'T BE LOOK AT NEXT DOOR'S IT HAS LOVELY GRASS 
SO GREAT VIEWS ACROSS THE VALLEY FROM THE BACK AND THE FRONT OF THIS LITTLE COTTAGE 
I LOVE IT AND THERE ARE STILL THE BEDROOMS TO SEE 
SO UPSTAIRS THREE BEDROOMS WHICH IS REALLY GOOD FOR THE SIZE OF THE PROPERTY 
THAT'S QUITE SMALL 
THAT ONE SLIGHTLY LARGER BUT IT HAS AN ORIGINAL FIREPLACE WHICH IS NICE TO SEE 
I KNOW IT'S SILLY BUT I LOVE THE FACT THAT THEY'VE LEFT THE ORIGINAL DOORS ON HERE 
STRIP THOSE BACK REALLY NICE TO SEE 
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE BIGGEST ROOM BUT WHY OH WHY IS THERE A BOILER IN HERE 
CLEARLY THAT WANTS ENCLOSING AT LEAST 
ANYWAY A NICE FEATURE AGAIN ANOTHER REAL FIREPLACE 
I DON'T KNOW IT JUST MAKES IT A LITTLE MORE EXCITING IN THE ROOM 
IT'S NOT A DULL BOX AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THESE BIG WINDOWS 
THIS ONE LOOKING OUT ONTO THE REAR GARDEN 
IT'S A NICE SOLID I DON'T KNOW RESPECTABLE PROPERTY 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S THE DECORATION OR THE DIRECTION THE HOUSE FACES 
BUT IT REALLY DOES FEEL LIGHT 
JUST IMAGINE THAT VIEW ON A SUNNY SUMMER'S DAY 
THE HOUSE WENT TO AUCTION WITH A GUIDE PRICE OF FIFTY NINE THOUSAND 
IT SEEMS A REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITY 
I'VE ARRANGED FOR A LOCAL ESTATE AGENT TO LOOK THE PLACE OVER 
THIS PROPERTY IS A FAIRLY STANDARD PROPERTY FOR THIS AREA 
AS ALL THE PROPERTIES IN THIS AREA WERE BUILT WHEN THE COAL MINE WAS OPENED IN ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED 
THESE ARE VERY GOOD STREETS BECAUSE THERE'S NOBODY OVERLOOKING YOU 
TO THE FRONT AND YOU'VE GOT A NICE PRIVATE GARDEN AS WELL TO THE REAR 
WELL I RECKON THE GARDEN IS A BIG PLUS BUT WHAT ABOUT INSIDE 
THE HOUSE LOOKS TO HAVE BEEN RECENTLY DECORATED 
YOU COULD MOVE IN IMMEDIATELY 
IT'S QUITE GOOD BECAUSE SOME WORKS HAVE BEEN DONE 
AND THERE'S NOT AN AWFUL LOT LEFT TO BE DONE TO MAKE IT SALEABLE OR RENTABLE 
A BUY TO LET INVESTOR COULD BE EARNING AN INCOME STRAIGHT AWAY 
SO HOW MUCH DO SIMILAR PROPERTIES LET FOR 
FOR RENTAL OF THIS PROPERTY YOU'D BE LOOKING AT ABOUT 
THREE HUNDRED NINETY TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TEN PER CALENDAR MONTH 
FOR THAT A TENANT WOULD GET THREE BEDROOMS DECORATED AND READY TO GO 
A NICE FAMILY HOUSE 
WELL I THINK IT'S A PRETTY SAFE BET THIS ONE IF YOU KNOW YOUR MARKET 
YOU'VE GOT A FIFTY NINE THOUSAND GUIDE PRICE ON A HOUSE WITH A MILLION DOLLAR VIEW 
HOW MUCH DID SOMEBODY PAY FOR IT AT THE AUCTION LET'S FIND OUT 
WE GO ON NOW TO LOT NUMBER TWENTY THREE 
IT'S TWENTY ONE BEDLINOG TERRACE BEDLINOG NEAR TREHARRIS 
I'M IN YOUR HANDS THEN 
BID ME SIXTY SIX TO GET ON 
SIXTY THEN LET'S GET STARTED SIXTY THANK YOU SIR 
AT SIXTY THOUSAND AND ONE ONE IS BID THANK YOU AT SIXTY ONE AND TWO IF YOU LIKE 
TWO THANK YOU AT SIXTY TWO THOUSAND 
THREE THANK YOU AT SIXTY THREE 
OR I'LL TAKE A HALF SIXTY THREE AND A HALF FOUR CAN I NOW 
SIXTY FOUR IN THE AISLE 
AND ANOTHER HALF BEHIND SIXTY FOUR AND A HALF FIVE CAN I SAY 
FIVE I'M BID AT SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND 
ALL RIGHT I'LL TAKE ANOTHER HALF SIXTY FIVE AND A HALF AT SIXTY FIVE AND A HALF 
SIX IF YOU LIKE YES TO SIXTY SIX AT SIXTY SIX YOU'RE OUT BEHIND 
AT SIXTY SIX THOUSAND ANOTHER HALF IF YOU LIKE

THE HAMMER'S UP I'M GOING TO SELL IT MAKE NO MISTAKE THERE'S MY BID 
I'VE SIXTY SIX THOUSAND ARE WE ALL DONE THEN 
AT SIXTY SIX THOUSAND IT'S YOURS SIR 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
THAT FINAL BID OF SIXTY SIX THOUSAND WAS MADE BY ALAN A FREELANCE MANAGEMENT AND SALES TRAINER 
HE'S WANTED TO GET INTO PROPERTY DEVELOPING FOR A LONG TIME BUT THIS WAS TO BE HIS FIRST ONE 
IT'S A JOINT VENTURE WITH HIS GRANDDAD DES WHO HELPED FUND THE PROJECT 
ALAN DES NICE TO MEET YOU BOTH THANK YOU AND YOU 
CONGRATULATIONS I LIKE YOUR HOUSE THANK YOU IT HAS A LOVELY VIEW WHY DID YOU BUY IT 
WE BOUGHT IT HOPING TO DO IT UP A BIT MORE AND THEN SELL IT FOR A BIT OF A PROFIT 
AND MOVE IT STRAIGHT ON AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE JUST A RENOVATION 
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THIS HOUSE THAT ATTRACTED YOU 
WELL ACTUALLY WE WERE AT THE SALE AND WE HAD ANOTHER HOUSE WE WANTED 
IT WENT A BIT HIGHER THAN WHAT WE WANTED TO PAY SO IT WAS COMING TOWARDS THE END 
THIS CAME UP AND WE SAID WE'LL TAKE A CHANCE YEAH 
SO WE BOUGHT IT BLIND IN EFFECT NO YES CARDINAL SIN YEP 
YOU HADN'T ACTUALLY SEEN IT NO WE HADN'T NO WE KNEW IT WAS CLOSE TO THE OTHER ONE 
BUT WE HADN'T ACTUALLY SEEN IT OH THAT'S O. K. THEN IF IT'S IN THE SAME VICINITY IT'LL BE FINE 
WE'RE HAPPIER THAT WE GOT THIS ONE IT TURNS OUT THIS ONE WE FEEL IS BETTER THAN THE OTHER ONE 
BUT IT COULD HAVE HAD ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS DAMP DRY ROT INFESTATION 
THE DRIVE ON THE WAY WE WERE WORRYING AND WONDERING WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN 
SO TALK ME THROUGH HOW IT FEELS DRIVING HERE WHEN YOU'VE SPENT SIXTY SIX THOUSAND AND YOU'VE NEVER SEEN IT 
HAVE WE DROPPED A CLANGER 
SO IT'S FINGERS CROSSED 
ALAN AND DES TOOK A REAL CHANCE BY PAYING SIXTY SIX THOUSAND FOR THIS MID TERRACE ON A WHIM 
NOT SOMETHING I'D ADVISE 
SO TELL ME ABOUT YOU TWO ARE YOU PASSING DOWN YOUR WISDOM 
YEAH I'M PUTTING ON THE WEALTH HE'S PUTTING ON HIS EXPERIENCE O. K. 
SO HOW'S IT GOING TO WORK FINANCIALLY 
WELL GRANDDAD PUT THE DEPOSIT DOWN I'M SECURING THE MORTGAGE AND THE MONEY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT 
MY FATHER THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS THE PAINTER 
AND DECORATOR SO HE'LL DO THE WORK WITH ME AS THE DOGSBODY AND PROJECT MANAGER 
TALK ME THROUGH WHAT YOU'LL DO 
WELL THE FIRST IDEA WAS TO KNOCK THAT WALL THROUGH MM HMM 
AT FIRST WHEN YOU TAP ON IT YOU THINK IT'S A PARTITION BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A LOAD BEARING WALL 
BECAUSE THEY'VE PARTITIONED OVER THE WALL THERE 
SO WE WANT TO STILL DO THAT BUT WE'LL HAVE TO INVESTIGATE HOW MUCH THAT'LL COST 
AND THEN THE KITCHEN IS IN QUITE GOOD NICK REALLY 
WE'RE THINKING BRING THE COST DOWN JUST TO CHANGE THE WORKTOPS AND CLEAN UP THE KITCHEN 
PAINT THE WALLS COS THE TILES ARE QUITE NICE AND WE MIGHT JUST KIND OF 
THE FLOOR AGAIN IS O. K. THERE'S TILES THERE THE BATHROOM AS WELL 
OH THE BATHROOM RETILE THE BATHROOM AND PAINT AND BOX IN THE TAPS 
WITH ALAN'S FATHER MALCOLM DOING THE DECORATING AND HIS GRANDDAD PROVIDING SOME OF THE FINANCE 
AND PLENTY OF EXPERIENCE THERE WILL BE THREE GENERATIONS ALL WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS ONE 
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR THE BEDROOMS 
AND UPSTAIRS AGAIN JUST A DECORATION JOB 
WE'LL DIP THE DOORS COS WE THINK IT'D BE NICE HMM 
AND ALSO THE FIREPLACES TRY AND BRING THEM BACK TO SOME ORIGINAL STATUS 
SO HOW MUCH HAS GRANDDAD BUDGETED OR IS ACTUALLY YOU WHO'S MAINE 
RIGHT I'VE BUDGETED FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WE WORKED OUT FOR THE WORK BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE A BIT LESS THAN THAT 
BECAUSE OF SOME THINGS THAT MIGHT NOT NEED DOING 
AND HOW MUCH TIME TO DO IT ALL 
I WOULD HOPE TO FINISH THIS WITHIN A MONTH TO SIX WEEKS WE'RE HOPEFUL OF THAT 
I THINK IF WE GET IT RIGHT WITH THE DECOR AND MAKE IT LOOK REALLY NICE 
THEN A FIRST TIME BUYER WILL LOVE IT 
THOUGH NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE WORK DES WILL BE MAKING SURE THAT 
HIS GRANDSON ALAN KEEPS TO THOSE DEADLINES AND BUDGETS 
AFTER ALL HIS MONEY IS ON THE LINE TOO 
SO WHAT'S YOUR INVOLVEMENT GOING TO BE JUST WATCHING HIM 
HE'LL BE ON THE PHONE EVERY DAY TO ME HOW MUCH LONGER IS IT GOING TO BE YEAH 
I'M NOT GOING TO BE PHYSICALLY DOING IT SO I HOPE HE'S GOING TO DO THE WORK 
THERE'S NO HOPE INVOLVED 
IT'S ALL PLANNED WHAT ABOUT WORKING WITH THE FAMILY IT MUST BE NICE 
YEAH I'VE WORKED WITH MY DAD ON I'VE MOVED HOUSE ABOUT THREE TIMES 
SO HE ALWAYS COMES IN AND DOES THE WORK HE'S BEEN DOING IT FOR FORTY YEARS 
HE'S AN EXPERIENCED PAINTER AND DECORATOR AND HE CAN DO TILING 
HE'S ALWAYS HELPED ME WITH DOING UP THE PROPERTIES THAT I'VE LIVED IN SO I KNOW HOW TO GET ON WITH HIM 
IT CAN BE TRYING SOMETIMES WITH YOUR FATHER BUT YOU KNOW 
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO GIVE HIM SOME SPACE AND GET ON WITH IT 
GOOD LUCK WITH IT THANK YOU 
I HOPE IT TURNS OUT WELL AND NEXT TIME MAKE SURE YOU LOOK AT THE PROPERTY BEFORE YOU BUY IT 
WE DEFINITELY WILL 
ALAN AND DES HAVE AN INTERESTING PROJECT HERE AND A LOT OF THE WORK HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE 
THEIR CHALLENGE IS TO ADD SOME EXTRA VALUE TO GET A RETURN ON THEIR JOINT INVESTMENT 
WHAT A GREAT TEAM ALAN AND DES MAKE 
NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY THAT THEY DIDN'T SEE THE PROPERTY BEFORE THEY BOUGHT IT 
BUT I THINK IN THIS INSTANCE THEY MIGHT GET AWAY WITH IT 
NOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND THEY'VE CERTAINLY GOT THE ENTHUSIASM TO DO IT 
FIND OUT HOW THEY GET ON LATER IN THE SHOW 
WELCOME TO WILLESDEN IN NORTH WEST LONDON 
IT'S AN AREA THAT'S CERTAINLY WELL SERVED BY LOCAL TRANSPORT 
THIS IS DOLLIS HILL TUBE 
IT'S TAKEN ME TWENTY MINUTES TO GET HERE FROM BOND STREET SO IT'S IDEALLY LOCATED FOR THOSE OF YOU 
WHO LIKE TO HIT THE SHOPS LIKE ME IN SUPER QUICK TIME 
GOOD TRANSPORT LINKS SHOPPING FACILITIES AND PARKS MAKE WILLESDEN A DESIRABLE PLACE TO LIVE 
WHEN BUYING PROPERTY I ALWAYS LOOK FOR PLACES THAT BORDER POSTCODES WHICH ARE ALREADY POPULAR 
YOU CAN FIND YOURSELF CASHING IN ON THE RIPPLE EFFECT IF YOU'RE LUCKY 
WELL FROM TALKING TO LOCAL AGENTS I'VE FOUND THAT BUYERS PRICED OUT OF THE FASHIONABLE WEST HAMPSTEAD MARKET 
ARE LOOKING TO WILLESDEN FOR MORE AFFORDABLE BUYS 
SO THE LOT UP FOR AUCTION TODAY IS ALREADY OFF TO A REALLY GOOD START 
HERE IT IS 
WELL IT'S A GROUND FLOOR TWO BEDROOM FLAT AND IT'S GOT A GUIDE PRICE OF JUST ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND 
THIS WASN'T ALWAYS FLATS IT WAS ONCE A LARGE VICTORIAN FAMILY HOUSE 
NOW YOU CAN SEE OVER THE YEARS HOW IT'S BEEN CONVERTED 
LOOK AT THIS A BANISTER POKING OUT 
THERE'S EVEN A STEP SHOWING BUT I'M GLAD IT'S ALL BEEN SAVED AND NOT CARVED UP 
NOW THERE'S A BATHROOM HERE YOU'VE GOT A HUGE ROOM IN HERE WHICH COULD BE A BEDROOM 
AND THIS IS WOW 
IT IS AMAZING 
IT'S SO EXCITING TO SEE ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL PERIOD FEATURES IN TACT 
LET'S JUST START WITH THE CEILING LOOK AT THAT CORNICING 
YOU'VE GOT THE LOVELY CEILING ROSE UP THERE IN THE MIDDLE 
AND OVER HERE THESE WONDERFUL BIG OLD DOORS 
THEY LOOK AS THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN PAINTED OVER AND SEALED IN THE MIDDLE 
A GOOD JOINER HOPEFULLY WILL BE ABLE TO OPEN THOSE UP AGAIN 
JUST IMAGINE HOW GRAND THAT WOULD BE BEING ABLE TO WALK FROM ONE ROOM TO THE OTHER 
IT REALLY WOULD BE AN AMAZING SPACE 
OVER HERE YOU'VE GOT THIS BIG OLD CHUNKY MARBLE FIREPLACE IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
THERE'S SO MUCH YOU COULD DO WITH THIS FLAT BUT SO FAR I'M LOVING IT 
IT'S REALLY GREAT TO HAVE ALL THOSE OLD FEATURES IN TACT 
WITH THE HIGH CEILINGS AND ORIGINAL MOULDINGS MOST OF THE ROOMS HAVE A REALLY GRAND FEEL TO THEM 
BUT THIS IS AN OLD HOUSE CONVERTED INTO FLATS 
SO IT'S NOT ALL ELEGANT SPACES 
WALKING IN HERE IT REALLY LOSES THE CHARACTER COMPLETELY 
IT'S A VERY SMALL BOXY KITCHEN AND IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE WOW FACTOR LIKE THE OTHER ROOMS 
NOW THROUGH HERE IT'S A RECEPTION ROOM THAT LEADS OUT TO THE GARDEN 
I THINK I WOULD BE INCLINED TO MAKE THESE TWO ROOMS ONE LARGE BEDROOM 
YOU COULD HAVE A HUGE OPEN PLAN KITCHEN AT THE FRONT OF THE PROPERTY IT'S WHERE YOU SPEND THE MOST TIME 
THIS REALLY IS A VERSATILE PROPERTY WITH SO MANY OPTIONS 
IT COULD BE TREATED AS A TWO BEDROOM FLAT WITH RECEPTION ROOM KITCHEN AND BATHROOM 
OR IT COULD HAVE THREE BEDROOMS WITH NO COMMUNAL SPACE 
I'D WANT TO SEEK SOME PROFESSIONAL ADVICE ON WHAT SORT OF PROPERTY 
IS IN DEMAND IN THE LOCAL AREA AND ARRANGE THE FLOOR PLAN TO SUIT THAT 
THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS GROUND FLOOR FLAT IS THAT YOU HAVE A GARDEN AND A SIZEABLE SPACE AT THAT 
IT'S CERTAINLY NO YARD AND FOR LONDON THAT IS A REAL BONUS BELIEVE ME 
WE'VE GOT A STORAGE AREA HERE 
COULD DO WITH A NEW DOOR PUTTING ON AND A VERY DILAPIDATED OUTSIDE LOO WHICH I WOULD KNOCK DOWN 
SO ONCE TIDIED UP IT COULD BE A REALLY LOVELY SPACE OUT HERE 
BUT SAYING THAT 
SO THAT IS THE MAIN DRAWBACK FOR AN OTHERWISE CHARMING PROPERTY 
BUT IF THIS WASN'T THERE THE GUIDE PRICE OF ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND WOULD PROBABLY BE MUCH HIGHER 
I ASKED A LOCAL AGENT TO TELL ME WHAT HE THINKS OF IT 
I THINK THE PROPERTY FIRST OF ALL IS A GOOD SIZE 
IT OFFERS QUITE GOOD ACCOMMODATION AND OBVIOUSLY 
IT'S GOT A GARDEN AT THE BACK SO IT'S A GREAT FEATURE FOR A GROUND FLOOR FLAT 
BUT THE MAJOR DRAWBACK WOULD BE THE RAILWAY LINE AT THE BACK 
THE MAJORITY OF BUYERS WILL BE A BIT RELUCTANT TO MAKE OFFERS 
BUT CERTAINLY THERE ARE BUYERS THAT WILL PROCEED AND MAKE OFFERS 
SO THE TRAINS MAY BE AN ISSUE FOR SOME BUYERS BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE 
THE SIZE OF THE FLAT ALONG WITH CHARACTER FEATURES 
CLOSENESS TO THE TUBE STATION AND EASY COMMUTE INTO CENTRAL LONDON 
FAR OUTWEIGHS THE NEGATIVES OF HAVING A RAILWAY TRACK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN 
ONCE THE PROPERTY'S REFURBISHED I WOULD SAY YOU COULD ACHIEVE UP TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE 
IT'S A DECENT SIZED FLAT WITH A NICE GARDEN AND AN AREA THAT'S CERTAINLY ON THE UP 
YOU ONLY NEED TO LOOK ALONG THE ROAD TO SEE THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTIES BEING UPGRADED 
THIS IS NO LONGER A CASE OF WHY WILLESDEN 
IT'S MORE A CASE OF WHY NOT WILLESDEN LET'S GO TO AUCTION 
LOT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT LITTLE GARDEN FLAT IN WILLESDEN 
WHO'D LIKE TO GIVE ME A START ON THIS HOW MUCH 
ONE HUNDRED NINETY THANK YOU ONE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND I'VE GOT 
ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE TWO HUNDRED 
TWO HUNDRED FIVE TWO HUNDRED TEN TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN 
TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN TWO HUNDRED TWENTY 
ANYBODY ELSE GOT TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND ON MY LEFT 
TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN 
NEARLY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND 
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND NO LEAVE IT WITH YOU 
IT'S WITH THE LADY 
BID'S AT TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND AGAINST YOU AND AGAINST YOU TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND FOR THE FIRST 
TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND BACK IN 
NEARLY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX THOUSAND NO 
IT'S WITH THE LADY IT'S TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
IT'S AGAINST YOU AND AGAINST YOU 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR THE FIRST 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR THE SECOND 
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR THE THIRD AND FINAL TIME WE'RE ALL DONE SOLD TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WELL BOUGHT 
THE WINNING BID OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WAS MADE BY TWENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD KELLY 
IT WAS HER FIRST BUY AT AUCTION AFTER SHE HAD MADE A RADICAL CAREER CHANGE 
I WORKED IN MUSIC SINCE I LEFT UNI WHICH WAS LIKE FOR FIVE YEARS IN A MUSIC BOOKING AGENCY 
AND THEN I JUST DECIDED TO HAVE A COMPLETE CAREER CHANGE WHY 
WELL A FEW DIFFERENT REASONS 
FIRSTLY I JUST WANTED SOMETHING WHERE I COULD ACTUALLY HAVE POTENTIAL TO MAKE SOME PROPER MONEY 
SO MY DAD WORKS IN PROPERTY AND HE SAID HE'D GIVE ME A BIT OF HELP AND ADVICE AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF 
AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN REALLY REALLY INTERESTED IN PROPERTY 
I'VE ALWAYS WATCHED ALL THE T. V. SHOWS AND READ ALL THE MAGAZINES HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THIS 
EIGHT MONTHS AND IS THIS YOUR FIRST PROPERTY YOU'VE BOUGHT 
NO IT'S THE FIRST ONE IN AUCTION I'VE BOUGHT AND SOLD ONE 
AND ONE'S ON THE MARKET HOPEFULLY WAITING FOR IT TO SELL AND I'M DOING TWO UP TWO OTHER ONES UP AS WELL 
KELLY CERTAINLY DOESN'T WASTE ANY TIME 
SHE'S GONE FROM MUSIC TO PROPERTY IN JUST EIGHT MONTHS 
AND ALREADY HAS A FEW PROJECTS ON THE GO 
SO WHAT DOES SHE HAVE IN MIND FOR THIS PLACE 
THERE'S A KITCHEN IN THE BACK 
I WAS GOING TO MOVE THAT INTO THE FRONT ROOM TO MAKE IT AN OPEN PLAN LOUNGE AND KITCHEN 
SO YOU PUT LIKE A STRIP OF KITCHEN 
AND THEN CREATE WITH THAT OLD KITCHEN CREATE ONE LARGE BEDROOM AT THE BACK 
SO YOU'VE GOT TWO REALLY NICE SIZE DOUBLES BOTH LEADING OUT ONTO THE GARDEN 
DO THE GARDEN UP PUT SOME DECKING AND PUT A LAWN OUT THERE 
OBVIOUSLY REDO THE BATHROOM BUT KEEP LOTS OF THE NICE FEATURES 
KELLY ORIGINALLY WANTED TO HAVE ALL THE WORK DONE AND PUT THE PROPERTY BACK ON THE MARKET 
BUT NOW SHE'S GOT ANOTHER MASTER PLAN 
OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS I'VE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A CHANGE AROUND 
IN THAT I THINK I MIGHT POSSIBLY SELL IT ON RATHER THAN DOING IT UP AND SELLING IT ON AFTERWARDS 
BECAUSE I THINK I MIGHT ACTUALLY MAKE MORE MONEY DOING IT THAT WAY 
WHY DO YOU THINK YOU'LL MAKE MORE MONEY 
I WORKED IT OUT AND THE BUDGET WITH DOING THIS WHOLE PLACE UP 
IT'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF WORK TO DO 
AND I FEEL THAT IF I JUST SORT OF SOLD IT ON 
I THINK I COULD PROBABLY MAKE MORE MONEY AND SAVE TIME DOING IT THAT WAY 
SO WHAT PRICE DO YOU THINK YOU COULD ACHIEVE FOR THIS AS IT IS 
I THINK THAT I COULD SELL IT ON FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
EVEN WITH THE TRAINS IN THE BACK GARDEN 
DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE MIGHT WALK IN AND LOVE THIS BUT NOT LOVE THAT 
I THINK FOR THIS ROAD WHICH IS A REALLY UP AND COMING ROAD 
IT'S A PARTICULARLY NICE PROPERTY FOR THIS ROAD AS WELL 
IT'S GOT A REALLY GREAT GARDEN DOUBLE GLAZING AND THE TRAINS PEOPLE CAN LIVE WITH 
FOR SOMEONE WHO HASN'T BEEN IN THE BUSINESS THAT LONG KELLY ALREADY SOUNDS LIKE A SHREWD BUSINESS WOMAN 
IF SHE CAN SELL THE HOUSE FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND 
SHE'LL WALK AWAY WITH A HEALTHY PROFIT WITHOUT THE HASSLE OF DOING THE REFURBISHMENT 
HOW DOES YOUR LIFE NOW COMPARE TO THE MUSIC INDUSTRY 
WELL IT DOESN'T MAYBE SOUND AS GLAMOROUS 
BUT I LOVE IT I REALLY LOVE IT 
I LOVE THE WHOLE PROCESS OF PROPERTY DEVELOPING JUST FROM START TO FINISH 
IT'S JUST EXCITING WHEN YOU BUY SOMEWHERE IT'S EXCITING DOING IT UP AND FINDING THE BUILDERS 
AND SEEING THE TRANSFORMATION THEN IT'S EXCITING PUTTING IT BACK ON THE MARKET AND SELLING IT 
THIS IS A REAL DEPARTURE FOR KELLY 
IT'S GOODBYE FREE GIGS AND GLAMOROUS PARTIES AND HELLO KITCHEN PLANNING AND WALLPAPER STRIPPING 
BUT SHE'S REALLY TAKEN TO IT AND ENJOYS THE BUZZ OF DEVELOPING 
WILL SHE SELL IT ON AND MAKE SOME FAST CASH HERE 
OR WILL SHE BE TEMPTED TO BRING THIS BACK TO ITS MAJESTIC GLORY 
JOIN ME LATER IN THE PROGRAMME TO FIND OUT 
COMING UP THERE'S A HOUSE IN LIVERPOOL THAT'S MAKING ME GO WEAK AT THE KNEES 
AND IT'S LIKE YOU'RE DRUNK YOU'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE 
FOR KELLY IT WAS CRUNCH TIME IN WILLESDEN 
WHAT DID SHE CHOOSE TO DO WITH HER GARDEN FLAT 
I'M REALLY PLEASED WITH MY DECISION 
BUT FIRST IN WALES THE WAITING'S NEARLY OVER FOR ALL OF US 
BE ON THE PHONE EVERYDAY TO ME HOW MUCH LONGER IS IT GOING TO BE YEAH 
THERE CAN BE FEW MORE INSPIRING VIEWS FROM A FRONT DOOR 
THAN LOOKING OUT ACROSS A BEAUTIFUL WELSH VALLEY 
TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD ALAN BOUGHT THIS TERRACED PROPERTY IN BEDLINOG MID GLAMORGAN FOR SIXTY SIX THOUSAND 
THE DEPOSIT WAS PAID BY HIS GRANDDAD AND ALAN'S FATHER 
A PAINTER AND DECORATOR WAS GOING TO HELP OUT WITH THE REFURBISHMENT 
WELL IT'S THREE MONTHS SINCE WE LAST VISITED THE VALLEY 
SO HOW HAVE THE THREE GENERATIONS GOT ON 
OUTSIDE THE HOUSE HAS BEEN REPAINTED FRONT AND BACK 
AND THAT STEEP LARGE REAR GARDEN HAS BEEN CLEARED AND A PATH LAID 
INSIDE THE FRONT ROOM HAS BEEN BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED AND THAT DIVIDING WALL HAS BEEN REMOVED 
SO DOWNSTAIRS IS NOW REALLY LIGHT AND VERY STYLISH 
AT THE BACK OF THE PROPERTY THE KITCHEN UNITS REMAIN BUT THE ROOM LOOKS MUCH BETTER 
ALSO THE BATHROOM SUITE HAS BEEN SAVED BUT NEW TILES ADD THE FINISHING TOUCHES 
UPSTAIRS THE STYLISH MAKEOVER IS EVIDENT IN THE THREE BEDROOMS 
THEY'VE BEEN DECORATED WITH NEW CARPETS AND RESTORED FIREPLACES AND IT'S BEEN A REAL FAMILY AFFAIR 
THE PROJECT ITSELF WAS WORKED ON WITH MYSELF AND MY BROTHER AND ALSO MY FATHER 
SO MY BROTHER WAS HELPING ME WITH THE GARDEN AND GENERALLY WITH THE PHYSICAL SIDE OF THINGS 
HOW DID THEY TACKLE THAT GARDEN 
WELL WHAT USED TO HAPPEN THE GRASS WAS COMING ALL THE WAY UP AND IT WAS A STEEP HILL AND IT WAS OVERGROWN 
SO WE HAD TO GET AN AREA WHERE YOU COULD SIT 
SO WE'VE BUILT THE WALL THERE WE'VE HAD TO LEVEL THE GROUND DIG A TRENCH AND BUILD THE WALL 
AND THEN PACK IT UP SO YOU'VE GOT A STRAIGHT FLAT AREA HERE FOR A SITTING AREA WITH ALL THE STONES 
AS YOU COME DOWN THE STEPS WE HAD A PATH DUG OUT ALL THE WAY THROUGH WITH BARK EITHER SIDE AND A DIVIDE 
AND WE'VE LEFT A SPACE THERE FOR FLOWER BEDS HOPEFULLY TO MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE AND ALSO USEABLE REALLY 
THE HOUSE ALREADY HAD AN OPEN PLAN KITCHEN EXTENSION 
AND NOW THAT THE MAIN WALL'S BEEN REMOVED IT'S CREATED A WONDERFUL DOWNSTAIRS SPACE 
WELL IN THE FRONT TWO ROOMS WE'VE AS YOU CAN SEE KNOCKED THROUGH 
WHICH BRINGS IN A LOT OF LIGHT FROM THE FRONT RIGHT THROUGH TO THE BACK 
WE HAD TO PUT A LINTEL IN TO SUPPORT THE WALL BECAUSE IT'S A LOAD BEARING WALL 
AND IT'S MADE IT A LOT MORE SPACIOUS A LOT MORE AIRY 
AND GENERATED A LOT MORE LIGHT WHICH I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR NOW SO WE'RE HAPPY WITH IT 
ALAN SPENT SIXTY SIX THOUSAND ON THE PROPERTY AT AUCTION AND THE FAMILY HAD LENT A HAND IN THE REFURBISHMENT 
MAKING MONEY WAS THE NAME OF THE GAME 
SO WAS THAT THE REASON FOR KEEPING THE KITCHEN AND BATHROOM SUITES 
WELL WITH THE KITCHEN PRETTY MUCH WE WERE POSSIBLY GOING TO CHANGE IT 
BUT THEN WE THOUGHT IT'S IN VERY GOOD CONDITION SO WE JUST REALLY GAVE IT A GOOD OLD CLEAN AND A PAINTING 
WE WERE GOING TO POTENTIALLY CHANGE THE BATHROOM SUITE 
BUT LOOKING AT THE SUITE THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE SUITE ITSELF 
IT WAS IN GOOD CONDITION SO WE RETILED IT WITH SOME FRESH WHITE ONES 
AND PUT A BORDER IN PAINTED THE CEILING AND THE WALLS AND THE PIPING AND I GAVE IT A GOOD CLEAN 
WELL THERE IS AN ADAGE IF IT AIN'T BROKE DON'T FIX IT 
WITH ANY INVESTMENT REMEMBER DON'T SPEND MONEY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
IT WILL ONLY COME OFF YOUR PROFIT AND WHEREVER POSSIBLE DO KEEP THOSE ORIGINAL FEATURES 
AS SOON AS I VIEWED THE PROPERTY TO START WITH AND SAW THOSE DOORS 
WE THOUGHT WE'D GET THEM BACK TO FARMHOUSE STYLE DOORS 
SO WE TOOK THEM AND GOT THEM STRIPPED 
THE SAME FOR THE FIREPLACES REALLY AGAIN IT'S NICE TO HAVE THEM IN THE BEDROOMS 
SO WE JUST MADE SURE THEY LOOKED CORRECT FOR THE TYPE OF PROPERTY THAT IT'S IN 
ALAN STRUCK A PERFECT BALANCE HERE 
THE ORIGINAL FEATURES REMAIN COMPLIMENTED BY HIS STYLISH DESIGN 
WE TRIED TO KEEP IT NEUTRAL 
HOWEVER WE FEEL WE'VE STYLED IT WITH WALLPAPER AND THE WOODEN FLOOR AND THE WARM CARPETS 
SO WE FEEL IT'S MORE HOMELY THAN A STANDARD PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT 
ALAN'S DAD DID THE DECORATING HIS BROTHER THE GARDEN AND HIS GRANDFATHER FUNDED THE DEPOSIT 
SO HAS HE BEEN KEEPING A WATCHFUL EYE ON HIS INVESTMENT 
HE KEPT TO HIS PART OF THE BARGAIN YEAH HE RANG ME ABOUT THREE TIMES A WEEK TO CHECK ON THE PROGRESS 
AND CHECK ON WHAT WORK WAS BEING DONE AND HOW MUCH WAS BEING SPENT AND WHERE 
SO IS IT GOOD NEWS THE ORIGINAL BUDGET WAS FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED HAS HE MANAGED TO STICK TO THAT 
WE CAME IN AT SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTEEN TO BE EXACT WHICH WAS SLIGHTLY OVER BUDGET 
BUT IT WAS NO UNEXPECTED EXTRA COST IT WAS JUST PURE LABOUR 
THE HOUSE COST SIXTY SIX THOUSAND AT AUCTION AND THEY'VE SPENT AROUND SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTEEN ON IT 
SO WILL THEIR TOTAL OUTLAY OF NEARLY SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND BE A GOOD FAMILY INVESTMENT 
WELL WHAT DO TWO LOCAL AGENTS THINK 
IT'S BEEN DECORATED IN A COUNTRY STYLE 
WITH SOME PINE DOORS ORIGINAL PINE DOORS 
AND THEY'VE KEPT THE ORIGINAL FEATURE FIREPLACES UPSTAIRS 
WITH THIS PROPERTY I CAN'T SEE ANY NEGATIVES 
APART FROM PEOPLE MAY NOT LIKE SOME OF THE WALLPAPERS 
MY PERSONAL OPINION IS I WOULD HAVE LEFT THE WALLS MAGNOLIA 
TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO PUT THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL MARK ON THE PROPERTY 
I HATE MAGNOLIA BECAUSE IT'S BORING AND BLAND AND HAS NO PERSONALITY 
AND I THINK WHEN PEOPLE COME INTO A PROPERTY THEY WANT TO HAVE A SENSE OF WARMTH AND A HOMELY FEEL TO IT 
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE TRYING TO MAKE MONEY OUT OF YOU AND PEOPLE WILL TRY AND BARGAIN MORE 
THAT'S AN INTERESTING THEORY BUT LET'S SEE WHAT THE TWO LOCAL AGENTS THINK THE HOUSE COULD BE WORTH 
REMEMBER ALAN BOUGHT IT FOR SIXTY SIX THOUSAND AND HAS SPENT AROUND SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ON IT 
I WOULD EXPECT THIS PROPERTY TO ACHIEVE ON A SALE NINETY TWO THOUSAND 
IF I WAS TO PUT THIS PROPERTY UP FOR SALE THEN I'D BE MARKETING THIS PROPERTY ABOUT NINETY TWO THOUSAND 
GOOD NEWS IT'S A HEALTHY PROFIT FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE TIME IT TOOK TO DO THE PROPERTY 
WE WERE IN AND OUT QUITE QUICKLY AND WE'VE PUT IT ON THE MARKET FOR THAT VALUE AS WELL 
HOPING TO SELL IT VERY QUICKLY AND MOVE ONTO THE NEXT PROJECT 
SO WILL ALAN PAY THE PROPERTY GENERATION GAME AGAIN 
IT WORKED QUITE WELL I MEAN THE FACT THAT WE WERE KEPT IN CONTACT 
ME AND MY FATHER OBVIOUSLY HERE ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS COMMUNICATING ALL THE TIME 
RINGING EACH OTHER IN THE EVENINGS AS WELL TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING THE NEXT DAY AND SO ON 
AND MY GRANDFATHER CALLING EVERY OTHER DAY TO CHECK UP ON WHAT WE'RE DOING 
SOMETIMES IT WAS TIRESOME BUT IT WORKED AND WE DID GET IT DONE IN A VERY SHORT SPACE OF TIME 
SO I CERTAINLY WOULD DO THE THREE GENERATION THING AGAIN 
THERE'S CERTAINLY NO SUBSTITUTE FOR EXPERIENCE AND THIS REFURBISHMENT HAS SPREAD ACROSS THREE GENERATIONS 
WE WISH ALAN AND THE WHOLE FAMILY EVERY SUCCESS ON THEIR NEXT PROJECT 
SOME CITIES NEED NO INTRODUCTION 
THEIR BUILDINGS AND STREET NAMES CAN DO IT FOR YOU 
I'M IN MOSSLEY HILL TWO MILES FROM LIVERPOOL CITY CENTRE 
AND QUITE POSSIBLY THE MOST FAMOUS SUBURB IN THE CITY 
GEORGE HARRISON AND JOHN LENNON WENT TO SCHOOL HERE 
FREDDIE MERCURY LIVED HERE AND IT'S ALSO THE SETTING FOR ONE OF THE BEATLES' MOST FAMOUS SONGS 
YES THIS FAMOUS STREET IS JUST MINUTES FROM THE HOUSE I'M VIEWING 
AND THE SHOPS ON PENNY LANE ARE JUST A SHORT WALK AWAY 
THIS PART OF MOSSLEY HILL IS AN IMPORTANT AREA OF LIVERPOOL 
NOT JUST TO BEATLES FANS BUT BECAUSE IT ALSO PLAYS A BIG PART IN THE CITY'S CULTURAL HERITAGE 
NOT SURPRISINGLY THEN THIS IS A FAIRLY POPULAR AREA OF LIVERPOOL TO BUY PROPERTY IN 
SO YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT PRICES WOULD BE CORRESPONDINGLY HIGH 
NOT NECESSARILY ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE BUYING AT AUCTION 
UP FOR OFFER IS THIS THREE BEDROOMED MID TERRACE 
GUIDE PRICE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND 
WHAT IS THAT 
WE NEED TO STEP BACK A BIT FURTHER FROM THE HOUSE 
A REALLY GOOD TIP THIS 
GO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD CAN YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THAT HOUSE 
LOOK AT THE SLANT ABOVE THE DOOR THERE THERE'S A HUGE GREAT CRACK 
IT SEEMS LIKE THE WHOLE PROPERTY IS ON A SLANT 
THAT'S REALLY ODD FOR A MID TERRACE 
WHATEVER IT'S REALLY BAD NEWS 
AND THIS IS SOME DAMAGE 
THE DOOR HAS PRACTICALLY BEEN FITTED WITH AN EXTRA PANEL AND THAT CRACK NEEDS SERIOUS ATTENTION 
THE ONLY PROMISING THING IS THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A RECENT SHIFT 
SO HOPEFULLY THE MOVEMENT IN THE STREET HAS SETTLED 
WELL MAYBE IT GETS BETTER INSIDE 
CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE IT HASN'T BEEN OCCUPIED FOR A WHILE JUDGING BY THE POST 
BUT WOW WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON HERE 
UP THE STAIRS THERE JUST ALL THE ANGLES JUST ALL OVER THE PLACE 
YIKES BUT ANYWAY LET'S SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT 
ENTRANCE HALL HERE YOU'VE GOT THE FRONT SITTING ROOM 
NICE TO SEE THAT THERE'S A FIREPLACE AND IT LOOKS LIKES IT'S A REASONABLE SIZED SPACE 
BUT THROUGH TO THE REAR SITTING ROOM 
I MEAN IT'S NOT A BAD SIZE SPACE AND THERE'S ANOTHER OPEN FIRE 
BUT I'M TRYING TO FIND SOME KIND OF STRAIGHT LINES IN HERE YOU KNOW NOTHING IS RIGHT 
THE DOOR FRAMES ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE THE CORNICING THE WALLS 
I MEAN EVEN THE FLOOR FEELS LIKE IT'S ON A SLANT 
BUT THROUGH THIS NARROW CORRIDOR TO THE REAR AREA OF THE HOUSE WHICH HAS BEEN CONVERTED INTO THE KITCHEN 
I SAY THAT BECAUSE I RECKON THAT THIS IS AN EXTENSION TO THE ORIGINAL PROPERTY 
BUT LOOK THE FLOOR IN HERE IS ALL OVER THE PLACE 
THE DOORS DON'T SEEM TO FIT VERY WELL AND AGAIN IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS MOVING AROUND 
ALL IN ALL IT'S NOT A GOOD START IS IT 
THIS REALLY IS ONE FOR THE EXPERTS 
GET THIS HOUSE SURVEYED 
LIFT SOME FLOORBOARDS POKE AROUND IN THE CUPBOARDS JUST CHECK AND THEN RECHECK 
IT MAY NOT BE AS BAD AS IT SEEMS BUT ANY NEW BUYER WILL HAVE TO BE PERSUADED THAT ALL IS WELL 
AND THEIR MORTGAGE LENDERS WILL HAVE TO BE CONVINCED THAT THE PROPERTY IS SOUND AND SALEABLE IN THE FUTURE 
SO THERE ARE CERTAINLY ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED 
UPSTAIRS NO IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER 
IN FACT IN SOME CASES IT GETS EVEN WORSE I MEAN LOOK THAT THERE 
YOU CAN SEE THE FLOOR ON A COMPLETE SLOPE 
THE BANISTER'S SLOPING THE DOOR FRAMES ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE 
I MEAN SADLY IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A BAD SIZED HOUSE 
YOU'VE GOT THREE GOOD SIZED BEDROOMS 
IF IT WAS JUST STRAIGHT IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC UPSTAIRS LOO WHICH IS GOOD TO SEE 
BUT YOU JUST WALK DOWN THIS YOU KNOW THIS CORRIDOR HERE AND IT'S LIKE YOU'RE DRUNK 
YOU'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE 
BUT THROUGH TO WHAT I GUESS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM 
IT'S A GOOD SIZED SPACE LOTS OF LIGHT COMING IN FROM THE WINDOWS 
SOME CRACKS ON THE CEILING SURPRISE SURPRISE 
SO THE BIG QUESTION IS WHY IS THIS HOUSE LIKE THIS 
WELL THAT'S WHERE A BIT OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE REALLY COMES IN HANDY 
I'VE BEEN ASKING SOME OF THE NEIGHBOURS AND THE LOCAL PUB ROUND HERE IS CALLED THE BROOKHOUSE PUB 
NOW A BROOK IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY MEANS A STREAM 
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT THE WHOLE AREA HERE IS CRISSCROSSED BY A BROOK A STREAM 
IN FACT IT RUNS UNDERNEATH THE HOUSE THAT IS LITERALLY THREE DOORS DOWN FROM HERE 
THAT HOUSE HAS SUNK AND WHAT IT'S DONE IS IT'S PULLED THE REST OF THE HOUSES IN THE TERRACE IN 
THE IMPORTANT THING IS IS THIS MOVEMENT HISTORIC OR IS THE HOUSE STILL MOVING 
THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS PROPERTY THE NUMBER ONE THING YOU'VE GOT TO THINK IS 
I'VE GOT TO GET A STRUCTURAL ENGINEER IN TO CHECK IT OUT 
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS ONE 
IT'S NOT A BAD SIZE IT'S IN A DECENT PART OF LIVERPOOL AND IT'S A REASONABLE PRICE 
BUT TO MAKE IT MARKETABLE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED VERY CLEAR EVIDENCE SHOWING WHY IT LEANS AND HAS CRACKS 
WHAT'S OUR LOCAL AGENT'S ANGLE ON THIS NOT SO STRAIGHT HOUSE 
THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE TO THE PROPERTY 
AND THE STRUCTURE WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED 
A BUYER WOULD STRUGGLE TO GET A MORTGAGE IF THERE IS STILL MOVEMENT 
SO WITH ALL THOSE PROBLEMS IS IT ACTUALLY WORTH BUYING 
IT IS A GOOD BUY BECAUSE YOU'RE BUYING INTO THE LOCATION IS THE KEY TO THIS PROPERTY 
IT'S A FANTASTIC LOCATION 
IT WILL RENT WELL IT WILL SELL WELL ONCE IT'S BEEN MODERNISED 
THE PROPERTY COULD ACHIEVE IN THE REGION OF ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND 
IF IT WAS EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH STANDARD IT COULD GO UP TO ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND 
SO IT COULD BE A GOOD BUY BUT I'D STILL WANT IT SURVEYED 
THIS IS NOT A PROJECT FOR THE UNWARY 
IT'S GOT A LOWISH GUIDE PRICE BUT AN UNTOLD AMOUNT OF WORK TO DO TO PUT IT STRAIGHT 
LET'S FIND OUT WHO DID BUY IT AT THE AUCTION 
WE MOVE ONTO LOT EIGHTY FIVE WHICH IS NUMBER FIFTEEN HERONDALE ROAD LIVERPOOL EIGHTEEN 
I'M GOING TO START AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GUIDE AT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND 
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND I'M BID ONE HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND 
ONE HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND 
ONE HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THREE THOUSAND 
ONE HUNDRED THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FOUR THOUSAND 
ONE HUNDRED FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND 
NEW BID AT ONE HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SIX THOUSAND 
ONE HUNDRED SEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND 
ONE HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND 
ONE HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN THOUSAND 
ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN THOUSAND ARE YOU ALL DONE 
AT ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME 
ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN THOUSAND 
ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND FOR THE SECOND TIME 
SOLD 
FOR ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND THE NEW OWNER OF THAT WONKY HOUSE IS PROPERTY DEVELOPER MIKE 
HE WORKS ALONGSIDE HIS FRIEND GARY AN EXPERIENCED BUILDER 
BUT THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND PLACE THEY'VE TAKEN ON TOGETHER 
MIKE GARY CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU I THINK 
WHY DID YOU BUY THE HOUSE 
LOCATION MAINLY TO BE HONEST WITH YOU RIGHT 
AND HAD YOU BEEN ROUND BEFORE YOU BOUGHT IT YES HAD A QUICK LOOK 
BIT UNSURE ABOUT SOME OF THE ANGLES IN THE WALLS AND THINGS 
A BIT UNSURE WELL WE'VE GOT A STRUCTURAL SURVEYOR COMING WHO'S GOING TO SORT IT ALL OUT FOR US 
WHAT ABOUT HAVING HIM ROUND BEFORE YOU BOUGHT IT RATHER THAN AFTER YOU BOUGHT IT 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD IDEA 
THE TROUBLE AT AUCTION IF YOU GO WITH A FEW PROPERTIES IN MIND 
YOU CAN'T HAVE A FULL STRUCTURAL SURVEY ON EVERY ONE NOT AT FOUR HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED A GO 
I THOUGHT WITH MID TERRACE WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FAIRLY SAFE 
AT LEAST THERE'S A PROPERTY EITHER SIDE HOLDING IT UP 
IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING ANYWHERE WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU FIRST SAW THE HOUSE GARY 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A BIT CROOKED LIKE 
A FEW BAD ANGLES AND THE DOOR FRAME OUT FRONT'S NOT EXACTLY THE SQUAREST I'VE EVER SEEN 
BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT'S MAINLY JUST COSMETIC 
THEY BOTH SEEM VERY CONFIDENT THAT ALL THE ANGLES AND CRACKS ARE NOTHING TO BE UNDULY WORRIED ABOUT 
SO IS THIS THE VOICE OF EXPERIENCE OR JUST BLIND OPTIMISM 
HOW MANY PROJECTS HAVE YOU EMBARKED ON BEFORE THIS THIS IS THE SECOND ONE 
THE FIRST ONE WAS A VERY STEEP LEARNING CURVE 
EQUALLY BOUGHT AT AUCTION ANY ERRORS ON THAT ANY MISJUDGEMENTS 
OH EVERY DAY 
REALLY 
YES BUT IT'S FINISHED WELL WHICH HAS GIVEN US A LOT MORE CONFIDENCE TO DO THIS 
IF IT COULD HAVE GONE WRONG ON THE LAST ONE IT WENT WRONG 
GARY COMES FROM A FAMILY IN THE BUILDING TRADE AND HAS WORKED ON REFURBISHMENT SINCE LEAVING SCHOOL 
HE'S NOW EMPLOYED BY MIKE WHO'S STILL FINDING HIS WAY IN THE PROPERTY GAME AFTER CHANGING CAREER 
BEEN WORKING FOR A BREWERY FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS OH RIGHT AS WHAT AREA MANAGER OH RIGHT GREAT 
WHEN THAT JOB WENT I WAS LOOKING OUT WHAT TO DO 
AND THE BIGGEST PART OF MY JOB OR THE BEST PART OF MY JOB WAS REFURBISHING PUBS 
SO THIS IS JUST ANOTHER STEP ON FROM THERE I SUPPOSE 
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED IN THE TIME YOU'VE BEEN REFURBING PUBS 
BUDGETS HOW TO COST THINGS HOW TO HANDLE CONTRACTORS 
AND JUST NOT TO BELIEVE WHAT'S ON THE WALLS YOU NEED TO LOOK BEHIND THEM 
THAT'S DEFINITELY GIVEN MIKE AN ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER FIRST TIME DEVELOPERS 
HE'S HAD THE LUXURY OF DOING REFURBISHMENT PROJECTS WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY 
NOW IT'S HIS OWN CASH AND HIS SOLE INCOME SO HE NEEDS TO GET IT RIGHT 
SO WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR THIS PLACE 
A GENERAL GOOD REFURBISHMENT ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
LITTLE BIT UNSURE HOW TO DO THE BATHROOM AS YET 
WHETHER TO TRY AND SQUEEZE A BATH IN OR WHETHER TO GO FOR JUST A SHOWER 
I'D LIKE IDEALLY TO GO INTO THE LOFT AND DO ANOTHER BEDROOM UP THERE 
AND MOVE THE BATHROOM INTO ONE OF THE BEDROOMS BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S VIABLE 
WHAT KIND OF BUDGET HAVE YOU SET ASIDE TOTAL BUDGET OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
OH RIGHT O. K. BUT PROBABLY NO MORE THAN SEVENTEEN THOUSAND OR EIGHTEEN THOUSAND ON THE ACTUAL REFURBISHMENT ITSELF 
THE REST BEING PROFESSIONAL COSTS AND INTEREST AND STAMP DUTY AND STUFF THAT MOST PEOPLE FORGET 
THIS MIGHT ONLY BE MIKE'S SECOND PERSONAL PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT BUT HIS EXPERIENCE RENOVATING PUBS 
HAS GIVEN HIM GREAT INSIGHT INTO WHAT ALL THE COSTS ARE AND HOW TO BUDGET A REFURBISHMENT 
THAT COULD BE INVALUABLE ON A TRICKY JOB LIKE THIS 
WELL MIKE AND GARY CERTAINLY SEEM TO HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO MAKE A SUCCESS OF THIS PROJECT 
BUT WHY OH WHY DIDN'T THEY HAVE A STRUCTURAL SURVEY DONE BEFORE THEY BOUGHT THIS PLACE 
I KNOW IT'S AN EXPENSE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT MORE THAN ONE PROPERTY AT AUCTION 
BUT CLEARLY FROM THE OUTSIDE THIS PLACE NEEDS SOME PROFESSIONAL ASSESSMENT 
AS IT IS THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT A FEW DAYS TO FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT 
THIS IS GOING TO TURN INTO SOMETHING WHICH WILL MAKE THEM ANY MONEY OR I FEAR POSSIBLY LOSE THEM MONEY 
YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW THEY GET ON LATER IN THE SHOW 
WE ALWAYS HOPE THAT OUR BUYERS HAVE SET THEMSELVES REALISTIC BUDGETS AND TIMESCALES 
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT AND THAT'S TO CATCH UP WITH THEM AFTER ALL THEIR HARD WORK 
TWO MONTHS AGO WE WERE IN WILLESDEN NORTH WEST LONDON 
UP FOR GRABS WAS THIS TWO BED FLAT 
THE GOOD SIZED ROOMS AND ORIGINAL FEATURES WON ME OVER 
BUT THERE WAS SOME OTHER FEATURES THAT I WAS LESS IMPRESSED WITH 
YOU'VE GOT TRAINS TO CONTEND WITH AT THE END OF THE GARDEN 
SOLD TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WELL BOUGHT 
THE FLAT WAS BOUGHT FOR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AT AUCTION BY KELLY 
WHO HAD QUIT THE MUSIC INDUSTRY TO FORGE A NEW CAREER IN PROPERTY 
I JUST DECIDED TO HAVE A COMPLETE CAREER CHANGE WHY 
I JUST WANTED SOMETHING WHERE I COULD ACTUALLY HAVE POTENTIAL TO MAKE SOME PROPER MONEY 
FOR THIS PROJECT KELLY WAS UNDECIDED 
SHE WOULD EITHER RENOVATE AND SELL ON OR 
I THINK I MIGHT POSSIBLY SELL IT ON RATHER THAN DOING IT UP AND SELLING IT ON AFTERWARDS 
BECAUSE I THINK I MIGHT ACTUALLY MAKE MORE MONEY DOING IT THAT WAY 
DID KELLY MAKE A QUICK BUCK AND PUT IT STRAIGHT BACK ON THE RESALE MARKET 
OR DID SHE STICK IT OUT AND DO THE WORK LET'S FIND OUT 
LAST TIME I WAS TRYING TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD DO SOME WORK TO IT OR NOT 
WE ACTUALLY ENDED UP DECIDING IT WAS GOING TO BE BETTER TO JUST SELL IT STRAIGHT ON 
IF WE HAD DECIDED TO DO THE WORK ON IT IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE COST ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND TO DO UP 
AND WE WOULD PROBABLY ONLY HAVE MADE ABOUT TEN THOUSAND ON THAT SO IT JUST WASN'T WORTH IT 
SO KELLY IS HOPING TO MAKE SOME FAST CASH AND LEAVE THE PROPERTY AS IT IS 
HAS SHE HAD ANY OFFERS 
INITIALLY WE HAD AN OFFER AND THAT WAS ALMOST ABOUT TO GO THROUGH 
THEN UNFORTUNATELY THE SURVEYOR CAME ROUND AND THERE WERE LOTS OF DAMP PROBLEMS WITH THE HOUSE 
SO THAT FELL THROUGH BUT THEN VERY SOON AFTER THAT 
WE GOT ANOTHER OFFER IN AND THE GUY WAS TOLD ABOUT THE DAMP AND IT DIDN'T APPEAR TO BE A PROBLEM 
SO WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR THAT TO GO THROUGH 
AND I'M HAPPY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY MORE THAN THE INITIAL OFFER 
THE INITIAL OFFER FROM THE FIRST PERSON WAS TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND NOW IT'S GONE UP TO TWO HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY 
SO I'M REALLY PLEASED WITH THAT I'M JUST WAITING FOR IT TO GO THROUGH SO FINGERS CROSSED 
TWO HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY IS PRACTICALLY THE MAXIMUM SHE COULD HAVE GOT BEFORE BREAKING THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MARK 
WHERE THE THREE PER CENT STAMP DUTY KICKS IN 
SO SHE'S REALLY GETTING A GOOD PRICE WHICH COULD NET HER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
THIS JUST GOES TO SHOW IT REALLY PAYS TO KNOW YOUR MARKET 
SHE MUST BE PLEASED WITH THE WAY IT'S GONE 
I FEEL QUITE HAPPY ABOUT IT ACTUALLY AND AS LONG AS WE EXCHANGE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS 
I'LL BE REALLY REALLY HAPPY AND I THINK IT WILL HAVE GONE WELL 
EVEN THOUGH THE PROPERTY IS UNDER OFFER UNTIL CONTRACTS ARE EXCHANGED THERE'S NO GUARANTEE 
AND SHE'S STILL GOT THE MORTGAGE TO PAY 
SO FAR WE'VE HAD THE PROPERTY FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS 
AND WE'RE UP TO ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND IN INTEREST 
SO I'M REALLY REALLY KEEN JUST TO GET THIS SALE TO BE EXCHANGED AND COMPLETED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
KELLY NEEDS TO SELL THE HOUSE QUICKLY OR THE INTEREST REPAYMENTS WILL EAT INTO ANY PROFITS SHE MIGHT MAKE HERE 
BUT COULD SHE HAVE MADE MORE MONEY IF SHE'D STUCK IT OUT AND RENOVATED IT 
WE ASKED SOME LOCAL AGENTS 
IF THE OWNER HAD SPENT TEN THOUSAND TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND ON THE PROPERTY 
IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE WORTH BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND TO TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
ONCE RENOVATED I THINK YOU COULD MARKET THIS PROPERTY FOR AROUND THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TO TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND MARK 
KELLY ESTIMATES THAT IT WOULD HAVE COST HER AROUND TWENTY THOUSAND TO DO ALL THE WORK 
HAD SHE DONE THAT AND BEEN ABLE TO SELL AT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND SHE WOULD HAVE MADE THIRTY THOUSAND 
BY SELLING IT STRAIGHT ON FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND SHE'LL HAVE MADE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND JUST FIVE THOUSAND LESS 
IN MY PERSONAL OPINION 
I THINK SHE'S MADE THE RIGHT DECISION TO SELL THE PROPERTY NOW 
I THINK SHE'S GETTING A GOOD PRICE FOR IT 
IF THIS WAS MY PROPERTY 
I CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE DONE THE WORK TO IT TO MAXIMISE MY PROFIT 
THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL 
SO SOME CONTRADICTORY THOUGHTS FROM OUR AGENTS BUT KELLY'S ADAMANT SHE'S DONE THE RIGHT THING 
I DEFINITELY THINK I'VE MADE THE RIGHT DECISION 
WE WOULD HAVE SPENT MONTHS DOING IT UP AND WE WOULD HAVE REALLY SEEN HARDLY ANYTHING BACK FROM IT 
SO I'M REALLY PLEASED WITH THE WAY IT'S GONE YEAH 
BUT KELLY IS NOT WASTING ANY TIME WAITING FOR THE SALE OF THIS HOUSE TO GO THROUGH 
SHE'S THINKING ABOUT THE BIGGER PICTURE 
THE NEXT STEP IS TO FIND SOME MORE PROPERTIES JUST SMALL FLATS TO DO UP 
RENOVATE AND SELL ON AND THEN NEXT YEAR I HOPE TO ALSO TAKE SOME ON AND LET THEM OUT 
THAT'S QUITE AN AMBITIOUS AGENDA FOR SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN DOING IT FOR LESS THAN A YEAR BUT FOR KELLY 
THERE'S NO TIME TO WASTE ON NOSTALGIC THOUGHTS OF THE GLAMOROUS MUSIC INDUSTRY SHE'S LEFT BEHIND 
RIGHT NOW FOR HER IT'S ALL ABOUT PROPERTY 
I LOVE THE EXCITEMENT I LIKE BEING ABLE TO BE QUITE CREATIVE 
SO I'M REALLY PLEASED WITH MY MOVE TO THE PROPERTY WORLD 
KELLY SEEMS TO HAVE DONE WELL HERE BUT SHE WAS SHREWD ENOUGH 
TO FIND AN EXCELLENT PROPERTY IN AN UP AND COMING AREA 
SPOTTING WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT BIG THING IS A SKILL THAT'S NEEDED 
NOT JUST IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY BUT WITH PROPERTIES TOO 
PENNY LANE BY THE BEATLES 
JUST OFF PENNY LANE IN LIVERPOOL A VICTORIAN THREE BEDROOMED HOUSE WAS BOUGHT FOR ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND 
BY ONE TIME BREWERY MANAGER TURNED PROPERTY DEVELOPER MIKE 
ALONG WITH HIS BUILDER FRIEND GARY HE FOUND THAT THEY'D TAKEN ON A TRICKY REFURBISHMENT 
A BIT UNSURE ABOUT SOME OF THE ANGLES IN THE WALLS AND THINGS 
A BIT UNSURE WE'VE GOT A STRUCTURAL SURVEYOR COMING WHO'S GOING TO SORT IT ALL OUT FOR US 
WHAT ABOUT HAVING HIM ROUND BEFORE YOU BOUGHT IT RATHER THAN AFTER 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD IDEA 
SO WAS IT A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE THE GAMBLE 
THREE MONTHS LATER WE'VE RETURNED TO SEE IF MIKE AND GARY 
HAVE GOT THIS HOUSE BACK ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW 
WELL THE FRONT LIVING ROOM HAS BEEN COMPLETELY OPENED UP WITH THE CORRIDOR REMOVED 
THERE'S A NEW FIREPLACE AND FOR ONCE THE ROOM ISN'T COMPLETELY MAGNOLIA IN COLOUR 
AND THAT RECEPTION ROOM WELL IT'S GETTING THERE 
WE'VE PRETTY MUCH REPLASTERED THROUGHOUT 
WE'VE HAD TO REPLACE ALL THE SKIRTING BOARDS ALL THE ARCHITRAVE ROUND THE DOORS 
WE'VE PUT A NEW KITCHEN IN 
UNLIKE THE COLOUR OF THE LOUNGE THEY TRIED TO BE A BIT DIFFERENT WITH THE KITCHEN 
GOING FOR A BOLDER LOOK BUT THIS ROOM CAME WITH ITS SHARE OF PROBLEMS 
WE HAD TO PUT A NEW FLOOR IN THREE TIMES BECAUSE WE HAD THE WATER LEAKS 
WE'VE RETILED NEW UNITS ALL THE WAY THROUGH NEW COOKER HOOD NEW COOKER NEW WASHING MACHINE 
AND REPLACED THE CEILING WHERE IT FELL IN 
SO THE KITCHEN REQUIRED FAIRLY EXTENSIVE WORK BUT THAT WAS RELATIVELY TRIVIAL 
COMPARED TO THE STRUCTURAL WORK NEEDED UPSTAIRS 
WELL IF YOU CAN REMEMBER THAT'S WHERE THE BIG CRACK WAS 
SO WE'VE HAD THIS CORNER REBUILT HAD THE STRUCTURAL SURVEYOR COMING OVER 
AND IT'S A VERY OLD CRACK IT HAD BEEN HERE FOR A LONG TIME SO WE JUST REBUILT THIS CORNER BASICALLY 
WE PUT A NEW RADIATOR IN WE'VE REPLASTERED IT ALL AND REPAINTED IT 
IN ADDITION THEY SORTED OUT THE WONKY DOOR AND PUT NEW BRICKS AND LINTELS IN TO RECTIFY THE CURVE 
THEY FIXED THE EXTERNAL CRACKS AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH THEY REDESIGNED THE BATHROOM LAYOUT 
WELL THE PROBLEM WITH THE BATHROOM BEFORE WAS IT WAS JUST TOO SMALL IF YOU REMEMBER THE WALL WAS HERE 
THIS IS WHERE THE ORIGINAL DOOR WAS 
SO WE'VE ACTUALLY PINCHED THIS AREA HERE OFF THE BEDROOM NEXT DOOR 
FORMED A NEW DOORWAY THROUGH MOVED IT OVER AND THE CORNER BATH 
I THINK THAT'S SUCH A GOOD DECISION 
EXTENDING THE BATHROOM INTO ONE OF THE BEDROOMS 
BENEFITS THE BATHROOM AND THE EFFECT ON THE BEDROOM IS MINIMAL 
THIS WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A HUGE UNDERTAKING 
THERE WERE CLEARLY STRUCTURAL AND LAYOUT ISSUES THAT NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED 
BUT MIKE ENDED UP HAVING TO DO ONE JOB HE WASN'T EXPECTING 
WE DIDN'T PLAN TO DO THE ROOF 
WE HAD A SURVEY ON THE ROOF WHICH SAID IT WAS GOOD FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS 
BUT TO BE HONEST WITH THE REST OF THE HOUSE BEING DONE IT DIDN'T LOOK RIGHT 
MIKE'S LOOKING TO RENT THIS HOUSE OUT AS A LONG TERM INVESTMENT 
SO DOING THE ROOF WAS VERY WISE 
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO ALL THE INTERNAL WORK ONLY THEN TO SUFFER DAMAGE CAUSED BY A LEAKY ROOF 
BUT IT WAS AN EXTRA COST TO HIS TWENTY THOUSAND BUDGET 
WITHOUT THE ROOF WE WERE PRETTY MUCH BANG ON 
WE'LL FINISH UP ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND OVER THOUGH AND THAT IS ALL THE ROOF 
I THINK HE'S DONE WELL TO KEEP THE BUDGET TO AROUND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CONSIDERING THE WORK THAT'S BEEN CARRIED OUT 
BUT THEN HE HAS MANAGED TO KEEP LABOUR COSTS DOWN 
WELL I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FULL TIME WITH GARY WE CAME TOGETHER ON THE LAST HOUSE 
IT WORKED OUT ALL RIGHT WE BOTH KNOW DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT DIFFERENT BITS OF THE JOB 
SO WE JUST PICK A JOB AND START ON WITH IT 
IF WE'RE STRUGGLING SOMETIMES WE SWAP OVER PART WAY THROUGH TO GET A FRESH SET OF EYES ON IT 
IN ADDITION TO GARY MIKE ALSO CALLED IN ANOTHER PLASTERER CUM HANDYMAN TO HELP 
IT NEEDED MORE THAN TWO OF THEM IF THEY WERE GOING TO COMPLETE IN A REASONABLE TIME 
AND JUDGING BY THE WORK DONE IN JUST TWELVE WEEKS IT CERTAINLY SEEMS TO HAVE DONE THE TRICK 
PAINTING AND DECORATING FITTING KITCHENS AND ALL 
IS QUITE A DEPARTURE FROM THE BREWERY WORLD SO DOES MIKE ENJOY HIS NEW CAREER 
I ENJOY IT IT'S NICE 
I DON'T PARTICULARLY ENJOY THE STRIPPING OUT PART AND THE MUCK AND ALL THE REST OF IT 
BUT ONCE YOU GET PAST THE HALFWAY STAGE YOU START PUTTING IT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN IT'S ENJOYABLE 
SO HAVE THEY MANAGED TO PUT THIS BACK TOGETHER AGAIN IN A WAY THAT WILL SEE SOME PROFIT 
WHAT DO TWO LOCAL AGENTS THINK 
I THINK THE HOUSE IS NICE 
I'VE GOT TO BE A LITTLE BIT CRITICAL 
BECAUSE I'M FEELING AS THOUGH THE NEW BUYER 
HAS SPENT NINETY PER CENT OF HIS MONEY APPROPRIATELY 
BUT I WOULD HAVE PUSHED THE BOAT OUT AND GONE THAT LITTLE DROP MORE 
I LIKE THE MODERN FINISH IN THE HOUSE THE UNUSUAL SHAPED FIREPLACE 
IT'S DIFFERENT HE'S ALSO NOT GONE FOR YOUR RUN OF THE MILL MAGNOLIA WALLS 
WHICH IS MORE INTERESTING WHEN TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS TO MARKET A HOUSE 
ONE THING I LIKE IS THE EXTENSION TO THE BATHROOM 
FOR A FAMILY HOUSE YOUR BATHROOM WAS EXCEEDINGLY SMALL 
HE'S STUDDED THE WALL OUT INTO THE MIDDLE BEDROOM 
AND THAT'S BEEN NOT VERY MUCH TO THE DETRIMENT OF THAT MIDDLE BEDROOM 
AND IT'S A MAJOR ADVANTAGE TO THE BATHROOM NOW 
I THINK HE'S GONE FOR A NICE CONTEMPORARY KITCHEN 
NICE AND NEUTRAL NOT GOING TO OFFEND ANYBODY AND IT'LL JUST APPEAL 
TO THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE I THINK THAT KITCHEN 
MIKE PAID ONE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND AT AUCTION FOR THIS PLACE 
AND WITH A SPEND OF AROUND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND 
HE'S GOT AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND INVESTED HERE 
SO IS IT AS SAFE AS HOUSES 
IF THE PROPERTY WAS ON THE MARKET NOW AT AROUND ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND 
IT WOULD ACHIEVE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF INTEREST 
I WOULD VALUE THIS PROPERTY IN THE RANGE BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND AND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND 
I'VE DONE MY OWN SORT OF VALUATION SORT OF RULE OF THUMB 
MY OWN PERSONAL ONE WAS ROUND THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND MARK 
POTENTIALLY THEN MIKE COULD MAKE TWENTY THOUSAND TO THIRTY THOUSAND MINUS COSTS 
IF HE SOLD THE HOUSE BUT HE'S ALWAYS INTENDED TO RENT IT OUT 
IS THAT FINANCIALLY VIABLE 
ON THE LETTINGS MARKET I WOULD ADVISE SIX HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED FIFTY PER CALENDAR MONTH 
NO PROBLEM FINDING A TENANT FOR IT AT AROUND ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED PER CALENDAR MONTH 
EIGHT HUNDRED SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT 
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD EXPECT YEAH I THINK SIX HUNDRED FIFTY IS ON THE LOW SIDE 
SO WILL MIKE STICK TO HIS ORIGINAL PLAN AND RENT THE HOUSE OUT 
WHAT DOES HE PLAN TO DO NEXT 
FINISH THIS IN A FEW WEEKS I'VE GOT A HOUSE IN RAINHILL WHICH IS CURRENTLY WITH THE SOLICITORS 
THAT SHOULD HAVE A COMPLETION ON THAT WITHIN A FORTNIGHT 
SO WE WILL JUST MOVE ONTO THAT 
THAT FITS IN WITH HIS LONG TERM STRATEGY 
I'D LIKE TO DO FOUR HOUSES A YEAR IF POSSIBLE AND IF I CAN RENT THREE OF THE FOUR IT WILL BE GREAT 
THAT'S THE SORT OF LONG TERM PLAN 
MIKE IS GOING TO BE BUSY IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS 
LUCKILY FOR THIS EX BREWERY MAN THE MOVE TO PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT 
CERTAINLY HASN'T LEFT HIM FEELING BITTER 
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT ANOTHER THREE STORIES OF INTREPID AUCTION PROPERTY PURCHASERS 
AND THERE'S ALWAYS MORE IF YOU JOIN US AGAIN FOR MORE HOMES UNDER THE HAMMER 
SEE YOU NEXT TIME GOODBYE GOODBYE
