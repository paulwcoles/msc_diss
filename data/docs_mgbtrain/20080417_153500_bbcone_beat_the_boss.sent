ZACHARY IS INTO BUGS AND BUBBLEGUM CAN HE BLOW THE COMPETITION AWAY 
I HATE TO BURST YOUR BUBBLE BIG SHOTS BUT YOU'RE GOING DOWN

BIG SHOTS WE'RE GONNA SWIM THROUGH THE CHALLENGE AND YOU'RE GONNA SINK 
SO THOSE ARE THE BRIGHT SPARKS BUT WHAT ABOUT THEIR COMPETITION 
MEET THE BIG SHOTS THERE'S SUE RANZIE AND ROISIN 
SUE IS THE VICE PRESIDENT OF A LEADING MARKET RESEARCH COMPANY 
THE BIG SHOTS HAVE EXPERIENCE AND THAT WILL BE THE MAJOR FACTOR HERE 
RANZIE IS AN ENTREPRENEUR WHO RUNS HIS OWN CREATIVE DESIGN AGENCY 
I UNDERSTAND BRANDS AND CREATIVITY HAVING RUN MY AGENCY FOR TEN YEARS 
ROISIN IS THE U. K.'S TOP MARKETING BOSS 
FROM SHAMPOO TO BATTERIES SHE'S IN CHARGE OF PRODUCTS WE USE DAILY 
I'M VERY COMPETITIVE WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS TROPHY 
THOSE ARE OUR TEAMS THE BIG SHOTS WITH BUCKETS OF BUSINESS BRILLIANCE 
AND THE BRIGHT SPARKS WHO ARE CLUED UP ABOUT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT 
THEY'LL BATTLE IT OUT FOR VICTORY AND THE BEAT THE BOSS TROPHY 
IT'S TIME TO DELIVER THEIR BRIEF 
I'VE GOT THE BRIEF CAN I COME IN YES COME ON IN 
HELLO BIG SHOTS HOW ARE YOU FEELING INTERESTED AND INTRIGUED 
WE'RE GONNA WIN WINNING IS THE ATTITUDE YEAH YEAH 
WHAT ABOUT YOU I'M FEELING REALLY REALLY EXCITED AND KIND OF NERVOUS 
WHAT WOULD YOU LOVE THE BRIEF TO BE SOMETHING EASY 
READY TO RECEIVE YOUR BRIEF YEAH 
ABSOLUTELY YEAH 
YOUR TEAM HAS TO GET ON THE CASE 
TO PRODUCE A NEW PIECE OF CHILDREN'S HAND LUGGAGE 
COOL THAT'S QUITE GOOD 
THIS SOFT FABRIC LUGGAGE PRODUCT MUST HELP YOU STAND OUT IN A CROWD 
AND INCLUDE A SPECIAL FEATURE TO MAKE YOUR JOURNEY MORE INTERESTING 
WELL YOU'VE JUST HEARD THE BRIEF HOW ARE YOU FEELING NOW 
QUITE GOOD WE CAN DO SOMETHING 
WE'LL STILL WIN IT'S GOOD BUT IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT HARD 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FANTASTIC FUN DOING THIS 
TO GET SOME GOOD IDEAS I'LL SEND YOU OFF TO DO YOUR MARKET RESEARCH 
THERE'S A LOT TO GET ON WITH I HOPE YOU GAIN MORE CONFIDENCE 
I'LL BE BACK LATER TO SEE HOW YOU GET ON 
WAS IT WHAT YOU EXPECTED NO BUT IT'LL BE FUN 
LET'S DO OUR MARKET RESEARCH YEAH 
I'M CONFIDENT WE KNOW WHAT CHILDREN WANT 
WE CAN GET DOWN TO BUSINESS WHILE THEY WASTE TIME 
BRIGHT SPARKS YOU'D BETTER WATCH OUT BECAUSE WE'RE COMING STRONG 
THIS TASK ISN'T GOING TO BE EASY 
THE U. K.'S LUGGAGE MARKET IS WORTH THREE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION 
SPOTTING A GAP IN THIS CROWDED MARKET WILL BE TOUGH 
THEY NEED TO DO MARKET RESEARCH 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS KNOW WHAT KIDS WANT BUT NOT WHAT'S ON THE MARKET 
SO THEY'LL DO SOME SHOPPING THE BIG SHOTS ALSO HIT THE SHOPS 
BUT WITH A MISSION TO FIND OUT WHAT YOU WANT 
THIS ONE'S INTERESTING THAT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT MOBILE PHONES 
I QUITE LIKE THESE THEY'RE CUTE 
WE'VE GOT A GREAT TEAM A LOT OF EXPERIENCE I'M FEELING QUITE GOOD 
I THINK THE IDEA OF TOYS IS CUTE 
WE COULD HAVE TOYS ATTACHED OR LITTLE ACCESSORIES YES 
WITH COMPARTMENTS AND ACCESSORIES 
PERSONALISING IT IS QUITE IMPORTANT 
I LIKE THE FABRIC AND IT'S VERY LIGHT 
I'M SURPRISED THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS FOR KIDS AROUND 
I LIKE THE IDEA OF TOYS BEING BUILT IN 
HOW ARE WE GONNA BE DIFFERENT 
WE'VE GOT TO TRY AND FIND SOMETHING THAT WILL STAND OUT AND BE FUN 
BEING DIFFERENT IS OUR CHALLENGE 
WE CAN EITHER HAVE THIS KIND OF HANDLE OR HAVE IT AS A BACKPACK 
OR BOTH YEAH LET'S DO BOTH 
AND SOMETHING THAT'S LIGHT BUT ATTRACTIVE AND GLAMOROUS 
THE MARKET RESEARCH IS GOING FINE WE'VE SEEN LOTS OF BAGS 
WE'RE PUTTING THE BEST ONES TOGETHER TRANSFORMING THEM TO OUR STANDARD 
NEXT THEY GET SOME EXPERT ADVICE 
THEY'RE MEETING LUGGAGE DESIGNER RAVI 
THIS IS THE MAXIMUM SIZE OF A PIECE OF LUGGAGE ALLOWED ONTO AN AIRLINER 
WHAT KIND OF MATERIAL IS BEST 
THE BEST KIND OF FABRICS ARE NYLON 
WHAT ABOUT THE COLOURS WE HAVE HERE 
BIT DULL REALLY DULL THAT PINK IS NOT IDEAL AND THE FABRIC 
YOU DON'T LIKE THAT FABRIC IT WOULD GET DIRTY REALLY EASILY 
I FEEL REALLY CONFIDENT I THOUGHT THE BRIEF WAS HARD 
BUT NOW WE'RE DOWN TO BUSINESS I'M FINDING IT EASY 
GOOD LUCK I HOPE YOU BEAT THOSE BIG SHOTS THANK YOU 
BIG SHOTS WE'RE GONNA CRUSH YOU 
WE'RE FLYING FIRST CLASS UP IN THE SKY 
MEANWHILE THE BIG SHOTS HAVE HEADED OFF TO THE AIRPORT 
THEY'RE CHECKING IN WITH THE HAND LUGGAGE EXPERTS AND FREQUENT FLYERS 
I BRING AN ANNUAL I BRING THIS PILLOW THING FOR COMFORT A BOOK 
I HAVE MY CAMERA SUNGLASSES AN M. P. THREE PLAYER TO LISTEN TO MUSIC 
DO YOU ALWAYS USE THE SAME BAG PRETTY MUCH SAME STYLE 
THE QUESTIONS THEY ASKED US WERE SUPERB 
LOOKING AT ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY THE GAMES CONSOLE PHONE CAMERA 
IF YOU DROP YOUR BAG THEY COULD DAMAGE SO IF YOU GOT PADDING O. K. 
THE KIDS GAVE US SOME INTERESTING INSIGHTS INTO HOW THEY USE BAGS 
THEY USED THE TIME WELL BUT I THINK THEY NEED TO REALLY GET IT TOGETHER 
WITH THE MARKET RESEARCH IN THE BAG IT'S TIME FOR THE BRAINSTORM 
LET'S HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE BRIEF SOFT FABRIC 
HELP YOU STAND OUT A FEATURE TO MAKE YOUR JOURNEY MORE INTERESTING 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS DIVIDE ROLES BETWEEN THEM 
YOU THINK OF THE DESIGNS I'LL DO THE DRAWING AND HE HELPS 
WHAT KIND OF POCKETS SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
AND DIFFERENT COLOURS FOR EACH ONE 
WE'LL WORRY ABOUT THE COLOURS LATER 
CARRY ON THINKING OF IDEAS WHILE I DRAW THEM 
COULD YOU TALK ONE AT A TIME 
I DON'T GET TO SAY ANYTHING 
WE SHOULD PUT CONSOLES IN IT AND HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK IT WILL COST 
COMMON SENSE STOP ARGUING JUST GET IT DOWN 
WHILE THE BRIGHT SPARKS QUIBBLE THE BIG SHOTS ARE FULL OF IDEAS 
GIVE THEM SIMPLE GAMES YEAH OR EVEN A BUILT IN M. P. THREE PLAYER TO PLAY 
IDEAS LIKE THE WHITEBOARD AREA 
WHERE YOU CAN PLAY NOUGHTS AND CROSSES WITH A FRIEND 
OR PERSONALISE YOUR BAG 
WHAT ARE WE THINKING OF IN TERMS OF SHAPE COULD JUST BE ROUND 
OR OVAL OVAL EGG SHAPED EVEN YEAH LIKE A POD 
THE BIG SHOTS' IDEAS MAY BE FLOWING 
BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY WITH THE BRIGHT SPARKS 
WHAT IS THIS OUR MASTERPLAN THAT DOES NOT INSPIRE ME 
IT LOOKS LIKE A RUCKSACK WHICH I'VE SEEN A HUNDRED TIMES OVER IN SHOPS 
BUT LET ME TELL YOU 
I DID AGREE WITH SAIRA BUT SHE WAS QUITE HARSH 
RIGHT NOW SERIOUSLY YOU ARE IN DEEP TROUBLE 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS ARE SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT KIDS LIKE 
BUT THESE KIDS HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE 
SO FAR THEY'VE DESIGNED A VERY BORING RUCKSACK 
AND THEIR TEAMWORK IS AN ABSOLUTE SHAMBLES 
ROISIN PITCH YOUR IDEA TO ME 
OUR BAG IS A COMPLETE ENTERTAINMENT POD 
IT'S EGG SHAPED WITH A WHITEBOARD THAT YOU CAN PERSONALISE 
WE WANT A BATTERY PACK IN CASE THEIR GAMES CONSOLE RUNS OUT OF POWER 
IS THE BATTERY THE SPECIAL FEATURE 
NO IT'S THE FACT THAT THIS IS AN ENTERTAINMENT BAG 
BUT ALL I CAN SEE IS A PLUG 
SAIRA'S COMMENTS WERE GOOD BUT I ALSO THOUGHT SHE WAS A BIT HARD 
WE HAVE WORK TO DO AND WE MUST TAKE YOUR FEEDBACK ON BOARD 
I'LL BE BACK LATER TO SEE HOW YOU GET ON THANK YOU 
HAS SHE GONE 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS' PROBLEMS CONTINUE 
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT STOP TALKING WHILE I'M TALKING 
TALK ONE AT A TIME WE'RE A TEAM WHEN HE DOES THAT HE'S ANGRY 
IT'S MAKING ME SICK OF HIM YOU'RE THE ONE NOT FOCUSING 
JUST GIVE ME THE IDEAS I'LL DRAW THEM DOWN 
O. K. THEN DON'T COME UP WITH IDEAS 
I WAS REALLY REALLY REALLY SICK OF ZACHARY IT WAS MAKING ME GET ANGRY 
GIVE ME MORE IDEAS THAT LOOKS TOO PLAIN POCKETS THANK YOU 
THAT'S A LITTLE LIGHT THERE WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO 
THE BIG SHOTS' BRAINSTORM IS CALMER AND MORE PROFESSIONAL 
COULD THE BACK BE A MAP OF THE WORLD IF IT WAS IT WOULD BE GREAT 
FOR MAPPING WHERE YOU'RE GOING 
COULD YOU HAVE WWW.WORLDBAG 
WORLDBAG WORLDBAG IS NICE YEAH 
IT TOOK US A WHILE BUT WE'VE COME UP WITH SOMETHING VERY UNIQUE 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS ARE STILL STRUGGLING WITH THEIR IDEA 
WHAT'S THE NAME FIRST OF ALL I DON'T KNOW SUPERBAG PACKSACK 
THAT'S GOOD AND DO ANOTHER LIGHT THERE ONE THERE A LIGHT THERE 
O. K. BRIGHT SPARKS YOUR TIME IS UP 
ZACHARY PRESENT YOUR FINAL IDEA TO ME 
WE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING CALLED A PACKSACK WITH A SPEAKER THERE 
A POCKET FOR CONSOLES WHERE 
JUST UNDER ONE OF THE SPEAKERS 
WHEN IT GOES OVER YOUR SHOULDER JUST TAKE IT OUT 
THAT'S OUR SPECIAL FEATURE HOW DID YOU FIND WORKING IN THIS TEAM 
QUITE HARD WHY BECAUSE THEM TWO WOULD BE HAVING A ROW 
I HAD TO TRY AND BREAK IT UP ME AND CAROLYN WERE MEANT TO FIND IDEAS 
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DRAW THEM BUT YOU KEPT THINKING OF IDEAS 
YOU WEREN'T THINKING OF ENOUGH ME AND CAROLYN WERE THINKING OF THEM 
I WROTE THEM DOWN I'VE HAD ENOUGH 
THIS IS YOUR FINAL DESIGN 
AND THE NEXT STAGE IS YOU'RE GOING TO PRESENT THIS IDEA 
TO A LEADING CHILDREN'S BAG COMPANY 
MY ONLY ADVICE TO THIS TEAM IS YOU REALLY MUST SORT OUT THE TEAMWORK 
IF YOU'RE TO COMPETE WITH THE BIG SHOTS 
YOU'VE REALLY REALLY GOT TO STEP UP THE GAME 
THIS IS WORLDBAG IT LOOKS LIKE THE WORLD IT'S ROUND LIKE THE WORLD 
INSIDE WE HAVE THIS IDEA EVERY JOURNEY'S AS INDIVIDUAL AS YOU ARE 
THEY CAN PLOT THEIR JOURNEYS 
AND LOTS OF COMPARTMENTS FOR THEIR ACCESSORIES 
HOW BIG IS THE BAG AND HOW DO YOU CARRY IT YOU CARRY IT ON YOUR BACK 
AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO KEEP PRETTY COMPACT 
I THINK IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT WELL DONE THANK YOU 
I THINK THE BIG SHOTS ARE GONNA WIN 
BECAUSE WE CAME TO AN EXCITING AND IMAGINATIVE IDEA THAT'S GOT LEGS 
THAT CAN LITERALLY TRAVEL THE WORLD AND I DON'T THINK IT'S BEATABLE 
WATCH OUT BIG SHOTS WE'VE HAD PROBLEMS BUT WE'LL STILL WIN 
IN PREPARATION FOR THE PITCH THE BIG SHOTS ARE GOING ALL OUT 
AND HAVE DRAWN UP A PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION 
THE BRIGHT SPOTS HAVE USED THE TIME TO ADD A SCOOTER AND A PANIC BUTTON 
ONLY ONE TEAM CAN WIN SO THE PRESSURE'S ON 
AS BOTH TEAMS MEET AT CHILDREN'S LUGGAGE MANUFACTURER TRUNKI 
THEY'LL BE PITCHING TO MANAGING DIRECTOR ROB LAW 
BIG SHOTS YOU WILL BE GOBSMACKED 
AS THE TEAMS MEET WHICH ONE THINKS THEY'VE GOT IT IN THE BAG 
YOU'RE SET TO PITCH YEAH HAVE YOU WORKED WELL TOGETHER 
THE QUESTION IS HAVE YOU 
THE BIG SHOTS ARE NOT THAT GOOD 
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT KIDS WANT 
THE BRIGHT SPARKS HAVE LOADS OF ENERGY BUT THEY'RE NOT A TEAM 
HEADS OR TAILS HEADS TAILS 
SO BIG SHOTS FIRST OR SECOND 
WE'LL GO SECOND PLEASE 
I THOUGHT THE BRIGHT SPARKS WOULD BE SO EXHAUSTING THEY'LL WEAR THEM OUT 
AND WE CAN COME IN AND BE MATURE AND A BREATH OF FRESH AIR 
THIS WAS OUT FIRST DESIGN BUT THAT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
SO WE HAD A GROUP DISCUSSION AND MADE A NEW DESIGN 
IT'S A THREE IN ONE IT'S A SCOOTER THAT TURNS INTO A BACKPACK 
AND THEN IT'S A PULL ALONG A TROLLEY BAG YEAH 
YOU PLUG IN YOUR M. P. THREE PLAYER AND IT'S GOT SPEAKERS TO BE LOUD 
THE BEST THING IS THE SPEAKER IDEA 
NO ONE'S DONE IT FOR KIDS YET THEY LOVE THEIR MUSIC 
IT ALSO HAS A PANIC BUTTON IF YOU GET LOST 
YOU CAN PRESS THE BUTTON AND A SIGNAL GOES TO YOUR MUM'S MOBILE 
THE WEAKEST IDEA WAS THE PANIC BUTTON IT WASN'T THAT NECESSARY 
TO WRAP UP THESE FEATURES WE HAVE GLOW IN THE DARK FLASHLIGHTS 
YOU'VE GOT LOTS OF INTERESTING IDEAS 
I THINK THE SCOOTER IDEA IS A GREAT IDEA 
BUT YOU'VE GOT SOME BIG HURDLES 
YOU'RE ADDING MORE WEIGHT TO THE BAG 
AND IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR IT TO BE COMFORTABLE 
WE ACTUALLY WORKED QUITE WELL 
HE TOLD US IT WAS QUITE GOOD 
THE CONCEPT STILL NEEDS A LOT OF WORK THEY NEED TO WORK TOGETHER 
SO WITH A THUMBS UP FOR THE BRIGHT SPARKS TIME FOR THE BIG SHOTS 
IT'S CALLED WORLDBAG IT IS UNIQUELY A ROUND BAG 
IT'S A BACKPACK 
WE REALLY WANTED TO FOCUS ON IT BEING COLOURFUL AND TACTILE 
PERSONALISATION IS IMPORTANT SO THE IDEA OF USING BADGES 
OR ANIMALS WE'VE GOT SOME EXAMPLES 
KIDS LOVE FROM OUR RESEARCH PERSONALISING THINGS 
FOR EXAMPLE FROM THE U. S. YOU COULD HAVE A LITTLE U. S. BEAR 
OR AN ANIMAL PEOPLE LOVE TAGGING THEM ON AND PERSONALISING THE BAG 
AND WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE FLASHING EXTERNAL LIGHTS 
WE'VE GOT POCKETS FOR GAMES CONSOLES OR BOOKS PENCILS 
MOBILE PHONES M. P. THREE PLAYER WE'VE CREATED A PIECE OF HAND LUGGAGE 
THAT'S COMPACT AND EASY TO CARRY AND HAS SPECIAL FEATURES 
TO KEEP CHILDREN AMUSED 
THE CUSTOMISATION FEATURE HANGING SOUVENIRS FROM YOUR JOURNEYS 
IS A GREAT IDEA BUT I DO HAVE SOME BAD NEWS FOR YOU 
WORLDBAG ALREADY EXISTS SO YOU'LL HAVE TO THINK OF ANOTHER NAME THERE 
ROB WASN'T SURE ABOUT THE NAME 
IT'S BEEN TAKEN ALREADY 
THAT'S AN AREA WE NEED TO LOOK AT IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING THAT FURTHER 
THE WHOLE IDEA IS GREAT AND A PARENT WOULD LOVE TO BUY IT 
WHETHER THE KIDS WOULD BUY INTO IT WITH AS MUCH ENTHUSIASM 
I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE YOU NEED TO MAKE IT FUNKY AND APPEALING TO THEM 
ROB WANTED IT BETTER FOR KIDS' 
I THINK WE NEED TO BUILD SOME FUN INTO THE PRODUCT 
THE BIG SHOTS WORKED INCREDIBLY WELL TOGETHER 
THEY LOOKED VERY CAPABLE I THINK IT'S QUITE CLOSE 
BUT THE KIDS COULD HAVE THE KILLER FEATURE 
BOTH TEAMS NEED TO RETHINK PARTS OF THEIR IDEAS 
WITH THE SCOOTER GONE THE BRIGHT SPARKS WORK WITH DESIGNER JOHN 
AND HAVE A NEW NAME MUSIC MAGIC 
MUSIC MAGIC AGREED YEAH 
I'M FINDING IT MUCH EASIER TO WORK AS A TEAM WE HAVE DIFFERENCES 
BUT WE CAN MAKE A VERY GOOD BAG 
THE BIG SHOTS ARE WORKING ON THEIR NEWLY NAMED GLOBAG WITH CHRIS 
WHERE CAN WE PUT THE TORCH I THINK THIS HANDLE 
THE END DESIGN IS GORGEOUS CHRIS HAS ADDED FANTASTIC DIMENSIONS 
VERY SATISFIED WITH IT 
I'M FEELING QUITE HAPPY WE'VE GOT THE COLOURS DESIGNS AND FABRICS 
IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD BAG SO WHAT DOES ROB THINK 
THEY'RE VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER 
BUT THE BRIGHT SPARKS' SPEAKER IDEA COULD JUST TIP THE BALANCE 
BUT IT'S NOT UP TO ROB THAT'S THE JOB OF OUR TWENTY FIVE JUDGES 
THE PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN MADE WHO'S GOING TO BAG THE TROPHY 
IT'S DECISION DAY 
BOTH OUR TEAMS ARRIVE AT BEAT THE BOSS H. Q. 
WE'VE GOT A FANTASTIC PRODUCT SPEAKERS WILL WIN IT FOR US 
IF WE WIN TODAY WE NEEDN'T HANG OUR HEADS IN SHAME 
I'M FEELING REALLY REALLY EXCITED 
BUT I'M ALSO FEELING QUITE NERVOUS I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN 
IF WE WERE TO LOSE IT'S BECAUSE WE THINK LIKE ADULTS 
AND HAVE DESIGNED IT FOR MUMS AND DADS 
BIG SHOTS WATCH OUT WE'RE GOING TO BEAT YOU 
MY MESSAGE TO THE BRIGHT SPARKS IS THAT IT'S A COLD DAY TODAY 
IT WON'T BE FUN AT THE BUS STOP 
WELCOME TEAMS TO THE BOARD ROOM 
TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU'RE GOING TO SEE YOUR PRODUCTS 
WALK THIS WAY 
BIG SHOTS YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE YOUR PRODUCT HOW ARE YOU FEELING 
WE DID THE BEST WE COULD SO REALLY EXCITED 
THERE YOU GO THE WHOLE IDEA IS BASED AROUND A GLOBE 
THEN THERE'S THE LIGHTS WHICH REFLECT CITIES AROUND THE WORLD 
YOU CAN CLIP MEMENTOES HAPPY WITH IT YEAH THE LIGHTS ARE GOOD 
AND WE HAVE A TORCH THERE WE GO 
THERE'S THE TORCH THERE 
AND A COMPASS THAT'S LOVELY 
WANT TO TRY IT ON SURE LET'S SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE 
ARE THE STRAPS LONG ENOUGH 
THERE YOU GO AND IT'S REALLY COMFORTABLE AS WELL 
THERE'S LOTS OF NOISE BEHIND ME 
WHAT HAS YOUR COMPETITION GOT TO SAY 
IT'S O. K. BUT YOU LOOK LIKE A TURTLE WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT 
THE GLOBE I'M VERY INTERESTED TO SEE THEIRS 
O. K. SO BRIGHT SPARKS YOU HAD A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THEIR PRODUCT 
HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU FEELING EXTREMELY READY TO SEE IT 
DEFINITELY O. K. HERE GOES 
THERE WE HAVE IT THE MUSIC MAGIC BAG 
THAT IS GREAT I REALLY LIKE THE COLOURS AND THE DESIGN 
IT MATCHES IN EVERYTHING COLOUR COORDINATED 
ARE YOU WORRIED IT LOOKS LIKE AN ORDINARY RUCKSACK IT LOOKS COOL 
AND STANDS OUT FROM THE CROWD 
SO WHAT GOES IN HERE 
YOU COULD PUT YOUR KEY RINGS HERE YOUR PENCILS AND PENS IN HERE 
YOU'VE GOT A MOBILE PHONE SOCKET IS YOUR BAG BETTER 
I HAVE ONE THING TO SAY YES 
BIG SHOTS WHAT DO YOU THINK THE COLOURS ARE PRETTY DULL 
THEY'RE NOT BRIGHT AND ATTRACTIVE 
IT DOESN'T STAND OUT FROM THE CROWD IT'S AN ORDINARY BAG WITH LIGHTS ON 
QUITE PLAIN O. K. WELL THE BIG SHOTS THINK IT'S PLAIN 
WE WENT ONE STEP UP AND THEY WENT ONE TOTAL STEP DOWN 
THE IMPORTANT THING IS WHAT DID YOUR TARGET MARKET THINK 
WE ASKED TWENTY FIVE CHILDREN TO TEST BOTH PRODUCTS 
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY 
THE BAGS WERE TAKEN TO LONDON'S SAINT PANCRAS INTERNATIONAL 
THE U. K.'S NEWEST STATION OUR JUDGES DON'T KNOW WHO MADE WHICH PRODUCT 
FIRST UP THE BIG SHOTS' GLOBAG I LIKE THE NAME 
IT JUST KIND OF PRESENTS THE BAG THE WAY IT IS 
IT'S COMFY BUT IT'S TOO SMALL 
THIS IS FILLING UP THE WHOLE SPACE YOU CAN'T PUT ANYTHING ELSE INSIDE 
AND YOU WANT TO PUT MORE ITEMS IN IT 
THE GLOBAG MAKES ME STAND OUT WITH THE LIGHTS AND BRIGHT COLOURS 
THERE WE ARE PART OF THE BRIEF 
ONE THING I LIKE IS THE TORCH AND THE COMPASS 
IT SHOWS WHERE YOU ARE GOING AND CAN HELP YOU ON A DARK DAY 
ONE THING I'D IMPROVE IS THE SIZE OF THE BAG 
I WOULDN'T FIT EVERYTHING IN BUT I WOULDN'T MAKE IT TOO BIG EITHER 
COS IT WOULD LOOK LIKE A GIANT POTATO 
NEXT IS THE MUSIC MAGIC 
IT'S VERY LIGHT IF YOU TRY AND PUT IT ON 
THEY SHOULD PUT THE SPEAKERS ON THE HANDLES RIGHT NEXT TO YOUR EARS 
I LIKE THE DESIGNS AND THE COLOURS THAT THEY USED 
I ALSO LIKE THE LIGHTS 
THE THING I DON'T LIKE IS THE LITTLE POCKET 
NOT MUCH SPACE FOR YOUR PHONE 
THE SPEAKERS ARE THE BEST BIT YEAH 
I DIDN'T LIKE THIS MY FRIEND USED IT WITH HIS SCOOTER IT SLIPPED OFF 
BRIGHT SPARKS OUR JUDGES LIKED THE SPEAKERS 
BUT THE STRAPS AREN'T STRONG ENOUGH 
BIG SHOTS THEY THOUGHT YOU'D STAND OUT IN A CROWD 
BUT FELT IT WASN'T BIG ENOUGH 
BUT WHO DID OUR JUDGES VOTE AS THE OVERALL WINNER 
OF THE BEAT THE BOSS TROPHY 
I HAVE THE RESULT RIGHT HERE 
THE WINNERS OF THE BEAT THE BOSS HAND LUGGAGE PRODUCT 
WITH A LANDSLIDE VICTORY OF TWENTY THREE TO ONE WITH ONE SPOILT VOTING SLIP

IT'S THE BUS HOME FOR YOU COME ON GUYS 
CHEERS CHEERS HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BEAT THE BOSSES 
WE WORKED EXTREMELY WELL TOGETHER THAT'S WHAT WON IT 
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE CLOSE 
I THINK THEY'RE FEELING EMBARRASSED HUMILIATED AND SPEECHLESS 
WE DIDN'T THINK AS CHILDREN 
OUR IDEA DIDN'T APPEAL TO CHILDREN I TOLD YOU WE WOULD WIN 
BEING BEATEN BY KIDS I DON'T THINK AGE REALLY MATTERS 
BEING BEATEN IS NEVER ENJOYABLE 
I TAKE LIMOS ALL THE TIME SO THIS IS REFRESHING 
WE WON BYE ENJOY THE BUS RIDE BIG SHOTS 
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GOT BEATEN BY A BUNCH OF KIDS SHAME ON YOU
